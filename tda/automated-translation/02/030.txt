The Enemy Was the US and Britain from the Start! Remember July 7th
5th Anniversary of the China Incident

July 7th marks the 5th anniversary of the China Incident under the Greater East Asia War. Looking back, these four and a half years of the China Incident were, so to speak, the prelude to the Greater East Asia War, and also the first act of the Greater East Asia War. In a broader sense, it would not be wrong to view the Greater East Asia War as having already begun five years ago on this very day.

The enemy, from the very beginning, was the United States and Britain. The true enemy is only the US and Britain. China, being of the same script and same race, who should join hands with us to build a prosperous Greater Asia, why has it come to shout "Oppose Japan, Resist"? This was not China's will, but rather the miscalculation and crime of Chiang's [Chiang Kai-shek's] faction in the Ch'unggyŏng [Chongqing] regime, dancing foolishly after being instigated by the US and Britain. Chiang was the comic actor, and the stage directors were hiding behind the scenes – namely, the incomparably cunning Roosevelt and Churchill.

Here, our country's sword of justice had no choice but to move towards the fundamental annihilation of the US and Britain, finally leading to the declaration of war against the US and Britain on December 8th last year. In half a year since the war began, our country has indeed subdued a sea surface covering 10,000 kilometers north-south, 20,000 kilometers east-west, from the Aleutian <17> Islands to Sydney in Australia and Madagascar in South Africa, a vast expanse of 200 million square *ri* [unit of area, ambiguous here, likely intended as square miles or kilometers], achieving splendid results with its operational area covering two-thirds of the globe.

Even now, we cry out thus:
『支那よ目覺めよ, 我々の 大東亞共榮圈は君の座席を忘れてはゐない. 全東亞が溫かい心で君の覺醒を待ち 望んでゐるのだぞ』
(China, awaken! Our Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has not forgotten your seat. All of East Asia awaits your awakening with a warm heart.)

Words to Proclaim to the People of Ch'unggyŏng [Chongqing]

Adopted at the Shanghai Rally for the Annihilation of US-Britain Citizens
The former anti-Japanese [sentiment] has been replaced by the annihilation of the US and Britain. The reward for the holy war of Japan-China-Manchukuo cooperation is the brilliant light of the establishment of the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. The patriots of new China's construction have awakened here. The Rally for the Annihilation of US-Britain Citizens held at the Shanghai Jing'an Temple Road Racecourse from 2 PM on the 3rd symbolized this awakening and self-awareness, heightening the national consciousness to strike the US and Britain! Towards the innocent compatriots still remaining in the Ch'unggyŏng camp, afflicted by the mistaken anti-Japanese resistance ideology, the 'Words to Proclaim to the People of Ch'unggyŏng' were unanimously resolved. Namely: 'US and British imperialists have engaged in aggression for a hundred years, seizing every opportunity. Especially in our Asia, the majority has groaned under their grasp. Among those made to weep by their aggressive policies are India and Burma; among those who have suffered from their bloodsucking are China and the Philippines. Examining their history of aggression and oppression in Asia in the historical records, one is struck by the vividness of the bloodstains, and the clear facts of aggression are visible. Should we eternally submit to their trampling? Since the outbreak of the War for the Liberation of the Greater East Asian Peoples, friendly forces [Japanese forces] have achieved great victories everywhere. This fact on one hand proves the true strength of the friendly forces and has lit the light of liberation for the East Asian peoples from the shackles of the US and Britain. The opportune moment for the revival of our East Asian peoples is before us. Rise! Compatriots! Let us strive further and rush to participate in this unprecedented great undertaking! Our compatriots under the Chiang regime, afflicted by false propaganda and narcotic poisoning through various conspiratorial means, still overestimate the power of Britain and America, misinterpreting their strength as sufficient to dominate both the Eastern and Western oceans, and misunderstanding them as cooperating with us sincerely and supporting our resistance, mistakenly believing in 'Resistance will surely win,' 'Nation-building will surely succeed.' That these mistaken psychologies are equivalent to a fool's dream is clear from the nation-ruining course of Poland and Slovakia, and is clearly seen in the past facts concerning France. Also, the defeated situation of the Anglo-American allied forces in Asia tells this story even more <18> eloquently. Furthermore, the intensification of the independence movement in India and the movement of the Burmese people to return to the true Asia are delivering fatal blows to them. You are likely experiencing more profoundly than us that the Burma Aid-Chiang Route is now being replaced by the Japanese Army's advance and capture. Under such circumstances, even if Britain and America do not abandon China, who can well guarantee that the promissory note of aid to Chiang is not a castle in the air? Compatriots! Awaken! And rise up so that you are never again deceived by their deceptive means! The Greater East Asia War is the war for national liberation that you have longed for. The success or failure of this war is the final juncture concerning the life or death of our East Asian peoples, and only after the liberation of East Asia can the founding of China and the revival of the nation be expected. Our Chinese People's Anti-British-American Association was born bearing such a mission. We hope and pray that our compatriots awaken as soon as possible, seek the true liberation and freedom of the Chinese people under the leadership of our new National Government, and advance towards the completion of our great enterprise!

The Agony of Ch'unggyŏng [Chongqing]
Murderous Prices
Ch'unggyŏng, heading towards collapse, has been failing at an accelerating pace since the Burma Road was cut off, and murderous prices are making the citizens weep.
Soap: 1 bar 50 to 100 won
Tooth powder: 1 container 20 won
Washbasin: 80 won
Haircut: 20 won per time
Chinese clothes: 150 won

Ch'unggyŏng, a Haven for Laborers
Although prices are this high, laborers, on the other hand, have high wages, so they are managing to get by somehow, but the most difficult strata are the upper class and the intelligentsia. The monthly salaries for the upper class are:
Director-level in the Ch'unggyŏng regime: 1,500 won
Minister-level: 800 won
University professor: 800 won
Middle school professor: 400 won
Therefore, it is said that a person who used to be a judge quit being a judge and now pulls a rickshaw, earning an average daily income of 100 won.

Female University Students Working as Hostesses
What about entertainment? Bars, cafes, etc., have almost all been shut down. However, the government has permitted a few cafes specifically for foreigners like the British and Americans residing in Ch'unggyŏng. Here, they reportedly make female university students, particularly those with pretty faces who speak English well, work as hostesses, forcing them to display flirtatious behavior (媚態).

Criticism Regarding the Soong Women Mounts
Among intellectuals, voices criticizing the Soong women [Soong sisters] are rising. Why is K'ung Hsiang-hsi's [H. H. Kung's] wife, Chiang Kai-shek's sister-in-law [Soong Ai-ling], not punished? When she escaped Hong Kong, did she not prevent important personnel from the Bank of Communications from boarding because there was no space, while bringing her seven dogs onto the airplane?
Also, because the K'ung Hsiang-hsi couple is said to appoint and dismiss government officials at will ('behead and attach' - 목 베이고 부치고),
a folk rhyme is spreading:
無孔不入 (No hole [K'ung] one cannot enter - meaning omnipresent influence/corruption)
無孔不行 (No hole [K'ung] one cannot pass through - meaning nothing happens without them) <19>

**Summary**

This 1942 article from the magazine "Great East Asia" commemorates the 5th anniversary of the Sino-Japanese War (called the "China Incident"), framing it as the start of the "Greater East Asia War." It vehemently blames the US and Britain (Roosevelt and Churchill) for inciting China (Chiang Kai-shek) against Japan, portraying Japan's war efforts as a righteous struggle to liberate Asia from Western imperialism. It includes a supposed declaration from Shanghai urging the Chinese in Chongqing to abandon Chiang, recognize the war as Asia's liberation, and join the "Co-Prosperity Sphere." The article contrasts Japan's alleged military successes with the supposed economic collapse, moral decay (inflation, class disparity, forced hostessing by students), and corruption (criticism of the Soong sisters/H.H. Kung) within Nationalist China (Chongqing). The piece is significant for colonial Korean history as it shows the type of intense pro-Japanese, anti-Western propaganda disseminated in Korea during the war. It co-opts Korean nationalist language ("compatriots," "liberation") for Japanese imperial aims and reflects the pressure on Koreans to internalize Japan's wartime narrative, viewing Japan, not the West, as the rightful leader of Asia and the US/UK as the ultimate enemy. Historians might find the specific details about life in Chongqing (prices, salaries, social commentary), even if exaggerated for propaganda, and the direct adaptation of Japanese political language and grammatical structures into Korean text particularly revealing.

敵은 最初부터 米英!, 銘記하라, 7월 7일
支那事變 5週年
7월 7일로써 大東亞戰爭下의 支那事變 5주년 기념일을 맛게 되엇는데 도리켜 생각하면 이 支那事變 4년 반은 말하자면 大東亞戰爭의 서곡이요, 또한 大東亞戰爭의 최초의 1절이라고 할 것으로 광의의 의미로 보면 벌서 大東亞戰爭은 5년전 이 달 이날에 시작되었다고 보아도 무관할 것이다.
적은 최초부터 米國과 英國이었다. 진정한 적은 米英일 뿐이다. 同文同種이요, 서로 손을 맛잡고 살기 좋은 大亞細亞를 건설하여 나갈 支那가 어찌하여 오늘날 反日抗戰은 부르짓게 되었는가 하면, 그것은 支那의 뜻이라기보다, 米英에게 선동을 받고 철없이 춤추는 重慶政權의 蔣 일파들 정치가의 오산이었고 또한 罪過였든 것이다. 蔣은 희극배우요, 무대감독은 그 배후에 숨어 있었으니 그가 곧 老狡無雙한 루-쓰벨트와 차-칠이었다.
여기에서 우리나라의 정의의 칼은 근원적인 米英 격멸에 나가지 아니치 못하야 드디어 작년 12월 8일, 對米英宣戰이 된 것이다. 開戰 반년에 우리나라는 실로 南北 1만 키로, 東西 2만 키로, 아류-산列島에서＜17＞ 濠洲의 「시도니-」 南阿弗利加의 「마다갈스」로 廣 2억평만리의 海面을 제압하고 그 작전면적이 지구의 3분 2을 덮는 훌륭한 전과를 거두고 있는 터이다.
지금이라도 우리는 이러케 부르짓는다.
『支那よ目覺めよ, 我々の 大東亞共榮圈は君の座席を忘れてはゐない. 全東亞が溫かい心で君の覺醒を待ち 望んでゐるのだぞ』
(寫眞은 事變發生地 盧溝橋) ＜18＞

重慶民衆に告ぐるの詞

上海米英擊滅市民大會で可決
かつての抗日は米英擊滅に置き代へられた、日華滿三國提携の聖戰が報はれるものは東亞共榮圈確立の赫々たる光明である、新中國建設の志士はこゝに目さめた、三日午後二時から上海靜安寺路競馬場で開かれた米英擊滅市民大會はこの覺醒と自覺を象徴して米英擊つ、べし! の民族意識を昂揚、いまなほ誤れる抗戰思想に禍ひされて重慶陣營にとゞまる無辜の同胞に對し『重慶民衆に吿ぐるの詞』を滿場一致を以て議決したのである。卽ち『米英諸國主義者は百年來凡ゆる機を見て侵略に從事して來た就中我がアジヤは大半其掌握下に呻吟して來た、彼等の侵略政策に泣かされたものにインド、ビルマあり彼等の吸血に苦しんで來たものに中國、ヒリツピンがある、彼等のアジヤ侵略壓迫史を士籍に考査して見るに血痕の生々しさに打たれると共に歷然たる侵略事實が見られるのである、われ等は永久に彼等の蹂躪に任せてよいか、大東亞民族解放戰爭勃發後友軍は到る處に大捷を博してゐるが、この事賁は一面友軍の實力を實證し大東亞民族を米英の桎梏から解放する光明を點じたものである、わが東亞民族復興の好機は目前に在り、起て! 同胞よ! われ等は一段と努力して此の不世出の大業に馳せ參じようではないか、蔣政權治下のわが同胞は虛僞の宣傳および各種謀略的手段に依る痲醉中毒とに禍されて今尙英米の強大を過大視し彼等の實力は東西兩洋を支配するに足るのみならす誠心誠意われ等と合作しわが抗戰を支援するものと誤解し『抗戰必勝』『建國必成』を誤信してゐる、此等の誤れる心理が痴人の夢に等しいものである事は波蘭、スロバキヤの亡國的經過に徴しても明らかであり、フランスの過去における事實において明確に見られるのである、又アジヤにおける英米聯合軍の敗況が尙一層＜18＞雄辯にこれを物語つてゐる、加ふるにインドの獨立運動の熾烈化とビルマ民衆の眞のアジヤに還元せんとする運動とは更に彼等に致命傷を與へてゐる、今や緬甸援蔣ルートが日軍の進攻略に換へられてゐることは諸君が吾々より深刻に體驗してゐることであらう、かゝる現狀下においてよしや英米が中國を見捨てることが無いとしても援蔣の手形が空中樓閣で無いと誰がよく保證し得ようぞ同胞よ! 覺醒せよしかして二度と彼等の欺瞞手段に迷はされないやう起ち上り給へ、大東亞戰は諸君のおこがれし民族解放戰である、この戰爭の成敗はわが東亞民族の生死に關する最後の關頭であり東亞の解放後にはじめて中國の建國民族の復興は期せられやう、我が中華民族反英米協會はかゝる使命を負ふて誕生したものである、希ひ願はくは我が同胞の一日も早く覺醒して我が新生國民政府領導の下に眞の中華民族の解放と自由とを求めしかして我等が偉大なる事業の完成に邁進せんことを!
重慶苦悶相
殺人的인 物價
몰락하여 가는 重慶은 「삐루마」루-도가 끊어지면서부터 더욱 가속도적으로 망하고 가서 살인적인 물가가 시민을 울니고 있다.
石鹼(비누)  1개 50원 내지 100원
齒粉  한개 20원
세수대야  80원
理髮  한번에 20원
支那服  150원

苦力天下의 重慶
물가가 이렇게 높으지만 그 대신 노동자들은 임금이 빗싸서 이럭저럭 사라가고 있으나 가장 어려운 층은 상류계급과 인테리층이다. 상류의 월급은
重慶政權의 원장급 1,500원
부장급 800원
대학교수 800원
중학교수 400원
그래서 어떤 판사다니든 사람은 판사를 그만두고 나와서 인력거 끌기를 하는데 하루 평균 100원 수입은 있다고 한다.

女大學生이 女給노릇
오락방면은 엇든가, 빠-라든지 카페- 등은 거이 전부가 폐쇄를 시켜버렸고 다만 重慶 와 있는 英米 등 외국인을 위하여 정부에서 몇몇 개의 카페-를 허가하고 있는데 여기에는 특히 얼굴 어엽부고 英語 잘하는 여자대학생들을 일부러 여급으로시켜 媚態를 발케 한다고.

宋女天下에 非難
識者 사이에는 宋女들을 비난하는 소리가 높으다. 蔣介石의 義妹인 孔祥熙 부인을 어째서 처벌치 않는가, 그 여자는 香港을 탈출할 적에 交通銀行의 重要人을 자리가 없어 못 앉게 하면서 자기의 「강아지」 일곱 마리는 비행기에 태여 오지 앉었는가,
또 孔祥熙 부처는 정부관리를 목 베이고 부치고 한다고 하여서
無孔不入, 無孔不行
이란 민요까지 흩어지고 있다.＜19＞
