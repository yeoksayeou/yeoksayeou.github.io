						By Pak Kŏyŏng

The Asia Development National Foundation Movement (興亞建國運動), which aims to support and guide Wang Ching-wei's (汪精衛) Peace Movement from the sidelines through a powerful mass organization, has its headquarters on Baoshan Road in Shanghai and is actively developing its movement, reaching from the intellectual stratum to the working class throughout China.

**Summary**

This article from the July 1942 issue of the magazine *Taedonga* introduces the leadership cadres of the "Asia Development National Foundation Movement" (興亞建國運動). This movement, based in Shanghai, aimed to support Wang Jingwei's Japanese-backed "Peace Movement" against the Nationalist government in Chongqing and the Chinese Communists. The article profiles fifteen key figures, detailing their past affiliations and experiences within the Kuomintang (including its Reorganization Clique), the military (under Sun Yat-sen), academia (professors at major universities), journalism, student organizations, the anti-Chiang "Third Party," and even counter-intelligence/secret societies like the Blue Shirts Society and the Communist Party. For historians studying Korean colonial history, this article is significant as it demonstrates how a Korean-language publication actively promoted a pro-Japanese, collaborationist movement in China during wartime. It reveals the intricate political landscape within China, showcasing the diverse backgrounds of those who joined Wang Jingwei's regime, and highlights the role of Korean media in disseminating Japanese propaganda related to the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." The list of individuals and their detailed (though potentially biased) biographies provide insight into the networks of collaboration and opposition during the Sino-Japanese War.
