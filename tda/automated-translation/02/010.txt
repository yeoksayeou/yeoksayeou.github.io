Greeting the Fifth Anniversary of the Holy War

As we now greet the fifth anniversary of the Incident, a day that should be eternally remembered by us, the one hundred million people, we first mourn the noble spirits (英靈) of the many fallen officers and soldiers who scattered like blossoms across the four hundred provinces, and earnestly pray for the continued fortunes of war for the brave soldiers of the Imperial Army.

The flames of war that ignited in a corner of the Chinese continent (支那大陸) have now expanded into a holy fire for the annihilation (擊滅) of the USA and Britain (米英), the root of all evil (元凶) in the exploitation of East Asia. Militarily and politically, on land, sea, and air, all major enemy strongholds have been overthrown by the hands of our Imperial Army (皇軍), and it will not be long before the two nations of the USA and Britain, which have piled up evil for centuries through injustice and military might, will inevitably collapse.

However, it is unbearably lamentable (痛歎) that the Chiang regime (蔣政權), its delusions (迷夢) not yet dispelled, continues the folly of inviting its own destruction (滅亡), becoming a sacrifice to American and British ambitions, driven by their evil hands (魔手). We hope that the Chinese populace itself will quickly awaken (自覺) and cease this futile resistance (抗戰). Finally, on this day, let us, the populace of the Peninsula (半島大衆), once again pledge together to strive for our training (鍊成) as Imperial subjects (皇民) and offer ever more sincerity of loyalty and patriotism (盡忠報國の赤誠).

**Summary**

This editorial, published in Keijō (Seoul) on the 5th anniversary of the Second Sino-Japanese War (referred to as the "Holy War"), commemorates Japan's war dead and celebrates recent military victories against the US and Britain, predicting their imminent collapse. It laments the continued resistance of Chiang Kai-shek's government, portraying it as a foolish puppet of Anglo-American interests. Crucially, it concludes with a direct call to the Korean populace ("Peninsula populace") to accelerate their assimilation as loyal subjects of the Japanese Emperor ("Imperial subjects") and demonstrate greater patriotism. From a Korean colonial history perspective, this article is significant as it explicitly shows the Japanese wartime propaganda aimed at Koreans, pressuring them towards "Kōminka" (皇民化 - Imperial Subjectification) and demanding their participation and loyalty in Japan's war effort, framing it as a path to enlightenment away from being manipulated by Western powers.

聖戰五週年を迎へて
我等一億國民にとつて永遠に記憶さるべき事變五週年記念日を玆に迎へるに方り先づ以て四百餘州へ華と散つた幾多の戰歿將士の英靈を吊ひ、尙ほ皇軍勇士の武連長久を祈るや切なるものがある。

今や支那大陸の一角に發した戰火は東亞搾取の元凶たる米英擊滅の聖なる火と擴大し、陸海空に於て軍事及政治上敵主要據點悉くが我が皇軍の手に依り覆減を見るに至り遠からず不正と武力とを以て幾世紀間惡を重ねづゝあつた米英の兩國は崩壞を免かれぬであろう。

しかし未た迷夢醒めず蔣政權は米英の魔手に使簇せられ、米英野心の犧牲となり自ら滅亡を招ぐの愚を續けるのは痛歎に堪えず、我等は支那民衆自身が速かに自覺し而て無益なる抗戰を止められんことを望む、終りに我等半島大衆は速かに皇民たるの鍊成に努め盡忠報國の赤誠をより以上擧けられんことを此日尙一度誓合ふてはないか。
