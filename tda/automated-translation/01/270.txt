American Military Armaments

I. America's National Defense Expenditure
1938: $957 million
1939: $1.139 billion
1940: $1.954 billion
1941: $6.463 billion (The national defense expenditure for 1941 was initially $2.336 billion, but with the addition of up to the 4th supplementary budget, it became $6.463 billion.)
1942: $17.485 billion (There is approximately $100 million in debt from the previous year to be repaid, so adding that makes the grand total $17.585 billion. Of this budget amount, about $10.5 billion (44.7 billion Yen in our currency), corresponding to 62%, is designated as military expenditure.)
If this is summed up with the military expenditures approved by Congress since June 1940, the total American military expenditure for the two years up to June 1942 is truly $28.48 billion<142> (approximately 122.5 billion Yen in our currency). Among this,
Army is approximately $13.7 billion
Navy is approximately $11.5 billion
Munitions factory expansion cost is approximately $1.7 billion.

II. America's Navy
The current strength of the American Navy and the lineup of the Two-Ocean Navy upon completion of future plans are shown as follows.
America's Naval Expansion Plan
Ship Type      Active   Under Construction   New Plan    Total

Capital Ships     15           10                7        32

Aircraft Carriers 6            4                8        18

Cruisers         37           21               27        85

Destroyers      197           56              115       368

Submarines      103           39               43       135

Total           358          130              200       688

However, the above statistics were published before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, so if the American Pacific Fleet's capital ships and various other naval vessels destroyed by Our Imperial Army in the recent Southwest Pacific naval battles are subtracted, the number of active ships in the above statistics has decreased.<143>

**Summary**

This 1942 article from the magazine "Greater East Asia" (大東亞) details the rapid increase in US defense spending from 1938 to 1942, highlighting the massive budget allocated for military purposes, particularly for the Army and Navy. It presents the planned expansion of the US Navy towards a "Two-Ocean Navy," listing projected ship counts by type. However, it concludes by noting that the listed 'active' naval strength is already diminished due to losses inflicted by the Japanese Imperial Army in the early stages of the Pacific War. For historians, the article is interesting as a piece of wartime propaganda published in colonial Korea. It acknowledges American industrial and military might (through budget figures and ship numbers) but simultaneously emphasizes recent Japanese victories to bolster morale and reinforce the narrative of Japanese military superiority in the ongoing conflict. The use of "邦貨" (Japanese Yen) for currency conversion and "我皇軍" (Our Imperial Army) underscores the colonial context and the publication's alignment with Japanese war aims.

米國의 軍備
						編輯室
一, 米國의 國防費
1938년에 9억 5천 7백만불
1939년에 11억 3천 9백만불
1940년에 19억 5천 4백만불
1941년에 64억 6천 3백만불(1941년도의 國防費는 當初에 23억 3천 6백만불이었으나 제 4차까지의 追加豫算을 加해서 64억 6천 3백만불이 되었다.)
1942년에 174억 8천 5백만불 (昨年度 負債를 償還할 것이 약 1억불이므로 그것까지 합하면 總計 175억 8천 5백만불이다. 이 豫算額中 6할 2분에 當하는 약 105억불 (邦貨 447억원)이 軍事費로 되어있다.)
이것을 1940년 6월 이후 議會의 협찬을 거친 軍事費까지 合算하면 1942년 6월까지의 2개년간의 米國 軍事費總額은 실로 284억8천만불＜142＞(邦貨 약 1천2백2십5억원)이다. 그 중에
陸軍이 약 137억불
海軍이 약 115억불
軍需工場 擴張費가 약 17억불이다.

二, 米國의 海軍
米國海軍의 現勢力과 今後 計畫의 完成까지의 兩洋艦隊의 陣容을 示하면 다음과 같다.
亞米利加의 海軍擴張計劃
艦種      現役   建造中   新計劃    計

主力艦      15      10       7      32

航空母艦     6       4       8      18

巡洋艦      37      21      27      85

驅逐艦     197      56     115     368

潛水艦     103      39      43     135

합계      358     130     200     688

그런데 上記 統計는 大東亞戰 勃發前의 發表이므로 今次 西南太平洋海戰에서 我皇軍에게 擊滅된 米國太平洋主力艦以下 諸艦艇을 빼어내면 上記 統計中 現役의 數는 減少되었다.＜143＞
