At Kwanghallu Pavilion in Namwŏn
Former Governor-General Saitō Makoto

Long have I heard it's Honam's finest pavilion;
On tour, I happen to lean upon its winding railing.
The respected elders guiding me show such deep kindness;
The mountains and rivers entering my view are like a painting to be gathered.
Snow, flowers, wind, moon – the scenes of the four seasons,
Now as in ancient times, can console people's sorrows.

Autumn, Shōwa 5 (1930) Kōsui

Former Chŏnbuk Governor Kim Sŏ-gyu

Not merely Honam's finest pavilion;
Compared across the entire land, it surely holds the top position.
Minister Hwang's lingering influence permeates a hundred generations;
Ch'unhyang's noted traces remain cool through a thousand autumns.
The mountains and rivers are as before, yet people have greatly changed;
Looking up and down, only the visitor's sorrow remains in vain.<27>

**Summary**

The article presents two classical Chinese poems about the famous Kwanghallu Pavilion in Namwŏn, Korea. The first, by former Japanese Governor-General Saitō Makoto (written in 1930), praises the pavilion's beauty, the surrounding scenery, and its timeless ability to soothe sorrow. The second, by former Korean provincial governor Kim Sŏ-gyu, echoes the praise but introduces a melancholic tone, reflecting on the enduring legacy of historical figures like Hwang Hŭi and Ch'unhyang associated with the pavilion, while lamenting the changes in human affairs contrasted with the unchanging landscape, leaving the visitor with a sense of sorrow. For historians, the juxtaposition of these poems is revealing: a high-ranking Japanese colonial official's seemingly appreciative yet detached view of Korean scenery versus a Korean official's more poignant reflection on cultural heritage and the passage of time under colonial rule, published together in a Japanese propaganda magazine ("Greater East Asia") during the height of the Pacific War. Kim's subtle expression of sorrow (`客子愁` - visitor's sorrow) takes on particular weight in this context.
