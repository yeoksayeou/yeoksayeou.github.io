**Summary**

Based on the title, this article discusses a shipbuilding yard in Incheon during the wartime period of 1943. It highlights the participation of numerous Korean workers ("Peninsula workers"), identifiable by their green work clothes, in the shipbuilding efforts. The article frames this industrial activity within the context of Japan's war against the United States and Britain ("War to Annihilate America and Britain") and positions it as part of Korea's contribution to the wartime industrial mobilization. For historians, this article title is interesting as it explicitly links Korean industrial labor (shipbuilding in Incheon) directly to Japan's Pacific War effort (米英擊滅戰) and uses the term "Peninsula workers" (半島職工), reflecting the colonial context and mobilization of Korean manpower for Japanese wartime industries. The mention of specific clothing ("靑菜服" - green work clothes) also offers a small visual detail about the workers.
