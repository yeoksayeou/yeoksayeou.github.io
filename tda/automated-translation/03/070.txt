**Summary**

This article from the March 1943 issue of "Daitōa" serves as a table of contents or list of presentations given by Korean representatives at the Greater East Asia Writers' Conference held in Tokyo the previous November. It lists four prominent Korean literary figures (using their Japanese names, with former Korean names noted for two) and the topics they spoke on. These topics revolved around establishing and strengthening the "Greater East Asia Spirit," cultural fusion, and utilizing literature to support Japan's war effort ("Greater East Asia War"). For historians, this piece is significant as it documents the public participation of leading Korean intellectuals like Yi Kwangsu (as Kōyama Mitsurō) and Pak Yŏnghŭi (as Yoshimura Kōgyaku) in a major Japanese wartime propaganda event, reflecting the complex pressures and collaborations during the late colonial period. The adoption of Japanese names and the pro-war themes illustrate the policy of *naisen ittai* (Japan and Korea as one body) and forced assimilation.
