Theatrical Advancement into Tokyo

<159>

**Summary**

This entry is a news item titled "Theatrical Advancement into Tokyo" from the March 1, 1943 issue of the magazine *Daitōa*. As the article's content is missing, details are unknown, but the title indicates a report on a theatre group's performance or establishment in Tokyo. From a historical perspective, this brief notice is interesting as it points to cultural movements between colonial Korea and mainland Japan during the height of the Pacific War (1943). Such an "advancement" into the imperial capital could signify participation in state-sponsored cultural programs designed to promote imperial unity or Japanese culture, potentially involving Korean artists or troupes performing for Japanese audiences or participating in larger cultural events within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere framework. It highlights the complex cultural interactions and mobilization efforts occurring during the late colonial period.
