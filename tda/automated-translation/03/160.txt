**Summary**

Based on the title and author, this article appears to be a summary of a lecture given by Maruyama Tsurukichi in Osaka. The lecture likely discussed the implementation of the conscription system for Koreans (referred to as "Peninsula Compatriots") and expressed gratitude for this policy. It probably framed conscription as a duty and honor for Koreans, integrating them further into the Japanese Empire during the wartime mobilization for the Greater East Asia War. For historians, this article provides insight into Japanese propaganda efforts aimed at justifying and promoting the controversial conscription of Koreans, portraying it as a beneficial step towards imperial unity and shared sacrifice, as viewed through the lens of a Japanese official involved in colonial affairs.
