**Summary**

Based solely on the title and author information, this editorial by Tsuboi Banshō in Shanghai discusses the future direction or "path forward" for Korean residents ("Peninsular Compatriots") living in Shanghai during the late colonial period. It specifically focuses on the implementation and progress of the "Naissen Ittai" (Japan-Korea Unification/Integration) movement within that specific community. For historians, the article title points to the complexities of colonial policy implementation in overseas communities, specifically how the ideological campaign of Naissen Ittai was being promoted or discussed among Koreans in the major international city of Shanghai, far from the Korean peninsula itself. It highlights the colonial authorities' (or their collaborators') concern with aligning overseas Koreans with Japanese imperial objectives during wartime.
