**Summary**

*(Summary based on title, author, and context, as the article body is missing)*
This article is presented as a shorthand record of a lecture delivered by Nagai Ryūtarō, a prominent Japanese politician and bureaucrat (former Minister of Communications and Director of the East Asia Bureau of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association), at the Keijō (Seoul) Civic Hall in March 1943. The lecture's title, "Heaven Will Surely Side with Justice," delivered during the height of the Pacific War, strongly suggests it was a piece of wartime propaganda aimed at the Korean population, justifying Japan's war effort and reinforcing the ideology of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere under the banner of "justice." For historians, the article (even just its title and context) is significant as it reflects the nature of Japanese propaganda disseminated in colonial Korea during the war, the co-option of concepts like "justice" for imperial aims, and the high-level figures involved in promoting the war effort directly to colonial subjects. The location (Keijō Civic Hall) indicates an attempt to reach a significant urban audience.
