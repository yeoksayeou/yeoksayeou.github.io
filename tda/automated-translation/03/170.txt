**Summary**

This article, based solely on its title and metadata, reports on a roundtable discussion held in Nanjing featuring Koreans ("Peninsula People"). The discussion focused on strategies for the development and advancement of the Korean community within Nanjing during the Japanese colonial period. From a historical perspective, this article is significant as it likely documents the views and aspirations of Koreans living within the Japanese sphere of influence in China, potentially shedding light on collaboration, adaptation strategies, or community concerns under wartime conditions. Historians might find the specific content (unavailable here) valuable for understanding the diverse experiences and perspectives of Koreans abroad during this era, particularly regarding their position within the Japanese empire's "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."
