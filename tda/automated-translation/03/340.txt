The poetic form known as *sijo* (時調) represents the soul of the Korean people (朝鮮民族). For centuries, their joys, sorrows, aspirations, and critiques of the times have been encapsulated within its unique structure. To truly understand the heart of the Korean peninsula, one must engage with its *sijo*. However, the barrier of language has often prevented a deeper appreciation among speakers of the National Language (國語).

This series aims to bridge that gap. By translating representative Korean *sijo* into the National Language, we hope to reveal the "true heart" (まこと心) contained within these verses. This endeavor is not merely a linguistic exercise; it is an attempt to foster mutual understanding and appreciation between the mainland (内地) and the peninsula (半島), contributing to the great harmony of the Empire.

The task of translation, especially of poetry, is fraught with challenges. The subtle nuances, the rhythm, the cultural backdrop – all these elements are difficult to convey perfectly in another tongue. The *sijo*, with its specific syllabic constraints and emotive depth, presents particular difficulties. Is it possible to capture the *makoto-gokoro* of a *sijo* in Japanese (國語)?

We believe it is possible, though perhaps not perfectly. The key lies in focusing not just on literal meaning, but on the underlying spirit and sentiment. A successful translation should evoke a similar emotional resonance in the reader of the National Language as the original does in a Korean reader. This requires not only linguistic skill but also a deep empathy for the culture from which the *sijo* emerged.

<154>
In this first installment, we will examine several classic *sijo*, exploring their themes and attempting faithful, yet evocative, translations into the National Language. We shall begin with works that express universal human emotions – love, longing, reflections on nature, and the passage of time. By starting with these common themes, we hope to make the world of *sijo* more accessible.

Consider, for example, the famous *sijo* attributed to Hwang Chini (黃眞伊). Its expression of longing is profound. Our translation aims to capture this depth. We invite the reader to compare the structure and feel, even without understanding the original Korean.

<155>
Of course, some *sijo* delve into specific historical contexts or philosophical ideas unique to Korea (朝鮮). Translating these requires even greater care and often necessitates explanatory notes. However, the essence, the *makoto-gokoro*, often transcends these specifics. It speaks to the shared humanity that binds us all within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere (大東亞共榮圈).

Future installments will delve into different types of *sijo*, including patriotic verses and those reflecting on societal changes. Through this ongoing work of translation and commentary, we aspire to contribute to a richer understanding of the diverse cultures within the Empire and the fundamental sincerity that can be found in the poetic traditions of the peninsula. This effort serves the ultimate goal of *naisen ittai* (内鮮一体), the true unity of Japan and Korea.

**Summary**

This article, the first in a series by Seo Du-su, introduces a project to translate Korean *sijo* poetry into Japanese (referred to as the "National Language"). The author argues that understanding *sijo* is key to understanding the "true heart" (makoto-gokoro) of the Korean people and that translation can foster mutual understanding between Japan (mainland) and Korea (peninsula). While acknowledging the difficulties of poetry translation, the author aims to convey the spirit and emotional resonance of *sijo*, starting with universal themes before moving to more culturally specific ones. The ultimate goal is framed within the context of imperial harmony, the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and achieving *naisen ittai* (Japan-Korea unity). For historians, the article is revealing in its explicit connection of literary translation to the Japanese colonial project's assimilationist goals (*naisen ittai*, *kokugo*) and its framing of Korean culture within the imperial structure (Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere). The attempt to define and translate the Korean "soul" or "true heart" into the colonizer's language is particularly noteworthy.
