True Story: Curing Chronic Gastrointestinal Disease and Neurasthenia
						Arakawa Umeji

**Summary**

This article, titled "True Story: Curing Chronic Gastrointestinal Disease and Neurasthenia" by Arakawa Umeji, appears to be a personal account or testimonial published in the March 1943 issue of the magazine "Greater East Asia" (大東亞). The title suggests a narrative focused on overcoming long-standing health problems, specifically digestive issues and neurasthenia (a common diagnosis at the time, often encompassing symptoms like fatigue, anxiety, and depression). From a historical perspective, such personal health narratives in a wartime publication might reflect broader societal concerns about health, resilience, and overcoming weakness. The diagnosis of neurasthenia (神經衰弱) itself is interesting, as it was frequently linked to the stresses of modern life and could provide insights into the perceived psychological pressures of the era, potentially within the colonial context if the author's background related to Korea or other parts of the Japanese empire.
