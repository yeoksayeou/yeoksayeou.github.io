**Summary**

This entry refers to the screenplay titled "The Suicide Squad of the Watchtower," written by Yamagata Yūsaku and Yagi Ryūichirō, and directed (presumably for a film adaptation) by Imai Tadashi, published in the March 1943 issue of the magazine "Greater East Asia" (大東亞). The title suggests a story focused on military themes, likely involving self-sacrifice and heroism from a Japanese perspective during wartime. For historians, this screenplay is significant as an example of wartime propaganda disseminated through popular media. Its publication in a magazine explicitly named "Greater East Asia" underscores its role in promoting the ideology of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and justifying Japanese militarism and sacrifice during the Pacific War.
