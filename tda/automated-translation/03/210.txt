**Summary**

This article, authored by Pak Kŏ-yŏng for the *Daitōa* magazine, reports on the activities of Korean (referred to as "Peninsula People") industrialists in Nanjing, China, during the Japanese occupation. Based on the title and context, the piece likely aims to portray the success and active participation of Koreans within the Japanese-controlled economic sphere in occupied China. From a historical perspective, this article is interesting as it potentially showcases Korean collaboration or integration into the Japanese wartime economic system in China, presented through the lens of a pro-Japanese publication. It could offer insights into the socioeconomic positions and strategies of some Koreans in occupied territories during this period, though likely framed within the propaganda narrative of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.
