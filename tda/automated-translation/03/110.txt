**Summary**

This article appears to be the first in a series by Abe Eiji, documenting interviews with the governors of Korea's thirteen provinces in 1943. This specific installment features an interview or discussion with Governor Kō (高) of Kyŏnggi Province (京畿道), focusing on his leadership style described as "taking command at the front." For historians, the article likely offers insights into the wartime administration of colonial Korea, the perspectives of high-ranking Japanese or pro-Japanese officials like the governor, and the rhetoric surrounding mobilization and leadership during a critical phase of the Pacific War. The emphasis on "front-line command" suggests a focus on wartime contributions and administrative efficiency as perceived by the colonial authorities.
