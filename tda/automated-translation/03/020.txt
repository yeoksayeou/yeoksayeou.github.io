<23> This Magazine's New Direction

**Summary**

This entry represents an announcement or editorial note titled "This Magazine's New Direction" published in the March 1943 issue of the magazine "大東亞" (Greater East Asia). Without the full text, the summary is based solely on the title and type; it indicates the magazine is outlining a change in its editorial policy, content focus, or overall objectives. For historians, this title from a wartime publication (1943) named "Greater East Asia" is significant. It strongly suggests the magazine is aligning itself more explicitly with Japan's wartime propaganda and the ideology of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, likely signaling shifts in content to better serve imperial aims during a critical phase of the Pacific War.
