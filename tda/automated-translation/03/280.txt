<136> Australia is a Nice Place

**Summary**

This entry consists only of a page number and the article title, "Australia is a Nice Place." There is no accompanying article text provided. The title itself, appearing in a Japanese publication ("Great East Asia") during the height of the Pacific War in March 1943, is notable. It presents a seemingly positive view of Australia, an Allied nation Japan was fighting against. This might suggest propaganda aimed at downplaying the enemy, depicting the land itself favorably (perhaps for future incorporation into the Empire), or it could be ironic, depending on the actual (missing) article content. Historians might find the title intriguing as it contrasts with typical wartime rhetoric against enemy nations.
