At Namwŏn Kwanghallu Pavilion
Former Chŏnbuk Governor Ko Wŏn-hun

Hyangnang Shrine (香娘祠) is warm, flowers like snow;
Hwangsang Gate (黃相門) is cool, grass evokes autumn.
Scattered misty light—I cannot capture it in verse;
It merely stirs idle sorrow in the traveler.

Shōwa Kōjutsu (甲戌), Pomegranate Summer (榴夏) [Summer 1934]

Former Hwanghae Governor Pak Sang-jun

A place of refined elegance, and a famed pavilion too;
A distant traveler, climbing late, laments his white hair.
Spring is early, no flowers, fragrance does not linger;
The old castle walls, withered grass, add further to the sorrow.

Kōjutsu (甲戌), Early Spring (早春) [Early Spring 1934] <29>

**Summary**

The article presents two Classical Chinese poems composed by former Korean provincial governors, Ko Wŏn-hun (Chŏnbuk) and Pak Sang-jun (Hwanghae), during visits to the famous Kwanghallu Pavilion in Namwŏn in 1934. Both poems express a sense of melancholy and reflection on the passage of time, contrasting the beauty of the location with personal feelings of sorrow or aging. For historians, the article is interesting as it shows high-ranking Korean officials under Japanese rule engaging in traditional literati practices (Classical Chinese poetry) and expressing personal sentiments about Korean landmarks within a publication ("Greater East Asia") aligned with the colonial power structure. Their participation reflects the complex cultural and political landscape for Korean elites during the colonial period.
