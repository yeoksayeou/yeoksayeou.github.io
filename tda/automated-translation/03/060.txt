**Korea's New Mission**
						Tanaka Takeo

I. Foreword

The world situation is rapidly changing day by day, hour by hour, toward the construction of a New World Order centered on Japan, Germany, and Italy. Our Japanese Empire, bearing the great responsibility for the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, is vigorously advancing toward the completion of the Greater East Asia War under the August Virtue of His Majesty the Emperor. In East Asia, the various peoples, liberated from the long-standing shackles and exploitation of Britain and America, are now marching mightily toward the construction of a New East Asia based on morality, hand in hand with Japan. This is truly a magnificent spectacle unprecedented in history. Korea (朝鮮), as part of the Empire, shares the same destiny as the mainland (内地). It goes without saying that the 24 million brethren of Korea must fulfill their duty as imperial subjects (皇国臣民) and bravely stand up to overcome this national crisis. The mission imposed upon Korea today is indeed grave and significant. Looking back, Korea, since the annexation (日韓合邦), under the benevolent imperial rule, has made remarkable progress in all aspects of politics, economy, culture, etc. The treatment of Koreans has dramatically improved compared to the past, especially with the recent implementation of the special volunteer soldier system (特別志願兵制度), the path has been opened for Koreans to fulfill the greatest duty of subjects, which is military service, and they can now participate in the sacred war as soldiers of the Imperial Army with the same qualifications as mainlanders. This is truly an epoch-making event and a matter of utmost joy for the Korean brethren. Furthermore, measures such as the encouragement of Japanese language use, the promotion of changing surnames and creating family names (氏姓創設), and the enforcement of worship at shrines (神社参拝) are all profound considerations aimed at nurturing and guiding Koreans as true imperial subjects. The Korean brethren must deeply understand this great sacred will, throw away their past dependence and inferiority complex, awaken to their mission as imperial subjects, and fulfill their duties perfectly.

II. Awakening as Imperial Subjects

For Koreans to perfectly fulfill their mission as imperial subjects, they must first fundamentally awaken as imperial subjects. While it is said that since the annexation, the treatment of Koreans has gradually improved, reaching the point where there is almost no difference compared to mainlanders today, it cannot be denied that in the past, there was a tendency for Koreans to be viewed as a separate people or treated differently. However, with the outbreak of the current Greater East Asia War, such distinctions have been completely eliminated. Koreans are truly imperial subjects, sharing life and death, joys and sorrows with the mainlanders. They are brothers and sisters who must cooperate for the prosperity of the Empire. There should be absolutely no discrimination or distinction between mainlanders and Koreans. The government authorities are also taking various measures based on this spirit. The aforementioned special volunteer soldier system is one example. It is truly moving to see young Koreans, burning with patriotism, volunteering for the battlefield one after another. This demonstrates that the spirit of imperial subjects has thoroughly permeated the Korean brethren. Furthermore, the government is planning to implement conscription (徴兵制度) in Korea in the future. This is also based on the idea that Koreans, as imperial subjects, should bear the duty of national defense just like mainlanders. The Korean brethren should feel boundless gratitude for this benevolent measure and must strive to become splendid imperial soldiers. Besides military service, Koreans also have a great mission in the economic field. Korea possesses abundant underground resources and vast arable land. Developing these resources and increasing food production is an urgent task for strengthening the Empire's national power. The Korean brethren must work diligently, endure hardships, and contribute to the expansion of production. Especially in the current situation where there is a labor shortage on the mainland, sending Korean labor to the mainland is an important mission. The Korean brethren must gladly respond to the nation's demands and fulfill their duty of labor service (勤労奉仕).

<45>
III. Thorough Implementation of Imperial Subject Education

To make the Korean brethren fully awaken as imperial subjects and fulfill their mission, it is essential to thoroughly implement imperial subject education (皇民化教育). Imperial subject education means nurturing and guiding Koreans to become true Japanese subjects, both in name and reality. Specifically, it involves thoroughly instilling the Japanese spirit (日本精神), promoting the use of the national language (国語 - Japanese), and encouraging customs and manners suitable for imperial subjects. The Japanese spirit is the core of the imperial way (皇道) and the foundation of the Empire's national polity (国体). It is crucial to make the Korean brethren deeply understand this spirit and live according to it. Promoting the use of the national language is also extremely important for fostering a sense of unity between the mainland and Korea. If Koreans can freely use Japanese, mutual understanding with mainlanders will deepen, and the sense of being fellow countrymen will naturally arise. Changing surnames and creating family names is also an important measure for imperial subjectification (皇民化). By having Japanese-style surnames, Koreans can become Japanese subjects both in name and reality. Worshiping at shrines is an expression of reverence for the gods and ancestors, and it is a duty for imperial subjects. By encouraging shrine worship, we aim to cultivate the religious sentiments appropriate for imperial subjects among Koreans. These imperial subject education policies must be promoted even more vigorously in the future. Schools, social education organizations, religious groups, etc., must all cooperate and strive for the thorough implementation of imperial subject education. At the same time, it is necessary for mainlanders to have a correct understanding of Korea and Koreans and to treat them with warmth and guidance, without discrimination. True assimilation (真の内鮮一体) can only be achieved through mutual understanding and cooperation between mainlanders and Koreans.

IV. Strengthening the Wartime Livelihood System

To enable the Korean brethren to fulfill their mission in the decisive war, it is necessary to strengthen the wartime livelihood system (戦時生活体制) in Korea. The Greater East Asia War is a total war, requiring the mobilization of the entire nation's strength. Not only soldiers on the front lines but also the people on the home front (銃後) must unite and fight through this national crisis. In Korea as well, it is necessary to establish a strong wartime livelihood system and thoroughly implement measures such as saving consumption, increasing production, and strengthening air defense. Saving consumption is essential to secure resources necessary for war execution. The Korean brethren must eliminate extravagance, lead a simple and sturdy life, and cooperate in saving materials. Increasing production is the foundation for strengthening national power. Everyone must work diligently at their respective workplaces and strive to increase the production of munitions, food, etc. Especially, increasing food production is an important mission assigned to Korea. Strengthening air defense is necessary to protect lives and property from enemy air raids. Preparations such as establishing air defense organizations, conducting drills, and setting up shelters must be made thoroughly. Furthermore, it is important to maintain public order and prevent espionage activities. The Korean brethren must cooperate with the military and police authorities, be vigilant against suspicious individuals and rumors, and strive to maintain stability on the home front. Establishing this kind of strong wartime livelihood system requires the unity and cooperation of the entire Korean populace. Government authorities, public organizations, and the general public must unite as one and strive to strengthen the wartime system.

V. Conclusion

The mission imposed upon Korea today is extremely grave. The 24 million Korean brethren, as imperial subjects, must fully awaken to this mission and contribute to the completion of the Greater East Asia War. For this purpose, it is necessary to thoroughly implement imperial subject education, strengthen the wartime livelihood system, and strive for the true assimilation of the mainland and Korea (内鮮一体の実). The government authorities must promote appropriate policies with unwavering determination, and the Korean brethren must respond to this with gratitude and devotion (感恩奉公). Mainlanders must also treat Koreans with warmth and strive for mutual understanding and cooperation. Only when Japan and Korea unite as one, sharing life and death, joys and sorrows, can the prosperity of the Empire and the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere be achieved. I sincerely hope that the Korean brethren will deeply understand their new mission and bravely rise to the occasion.

**Summary**

This editorial by Tanaka Takeo, published in March 1943, outlines "Korea's New Mission" within the Japanese Empire during the height of the Greater East Asia War. It argues that Koreans, liberated from Western influence and benefiting from Japanese rule since annexation, must now fully embrace their identity as imperial subjects (皇国臣民) and share Japan's destiny. The article emphasizes the importance of assimilation policies like promoting Japanese language, name changes (氏姓創設), and shrine worship (神社参拝) as expressions of benevolent imperial guidance. It portrays the introduction of the special volunteer soldier system and the planned implementation of conscription as granting Koreans the honorable duty of military service, equivalent to mainland Japanese. The piece calls upon Koreans to contribute wholeheartedly to the war effort through labor service (勤労奉仕), increased production (especially food), resource development, consumption saving, and maintaining stability on the home front (銃後). The ultimate goal, according to the author, is the true assimilation of Japan and Korea (内鮮一体の実) through imperial subject education (皇民化教育) and shared sacrifice for the Empire's victory and the establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

From a historical perspective, this article is a clear example of Japanese wartime propaganda aimed at mobilizing the Korean population and justifying intensified assimilation policies. Historians would find interest in its framing of colonial policies (annexation, name changes, shrine worship) as benevolent acts, the explicit linking of Korean identity to imperial subjecthood and wartime duties (military service, labor), and the articulation of the ideal of "Naissen Ittai" (内鮮一体 - Japan-Korea as One Body) as a tool for total mobilization during the final, desperate years of the war. It starkly reveals the ideological pressure and practical demands placed upon Koreans under late-stage Japanese colonial rule.
