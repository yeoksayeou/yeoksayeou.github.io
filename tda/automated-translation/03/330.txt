**Summary**

This text provides the title and introductory examples for a literary review article from the March 1943 issue of the magazine "Daitōa". The review focuses on newspaper serial novels written in Japanese ("Kokugo" - the National Language) by Korean authors (Yi Sŏkhun, using the Japanese pen name Maki Hiroshi, and Yi Muyŏng) published in Japanese-language newspapers in colonial Korea (Keijō Nippō in Seoul and Fuzan Nippō in Busan). For historians, this snippet highlights the linguistic assimilation policy during the late colonial period, where Japanese was promoted as the "national language" and Korean writers were producing literary works in Japanese for colonial media outlets. It points to the complex cultural and political landscape faced by Korean intellectuals and artists under Japanese rule.
