The Poet of the Baishōshū, Regarding Keisei, the Kisaeng of Fuan
						By Tanaka Hatsuo

[Full article text not provided]

**Summary**

This article, a piece of literary criticism by Tanaka Hatsuo published in March 1943, discusses the Korean kisaeng poet Kyesaeng (also known by her pen name Maech'ang) from Puan, the author of the poetry collection *Maech'angjip* (read as *Baishōshū* in Japanese). Given the publication date (during the height of the Pacific War and Japanese colonial rule) and the magazine title "大東亜" (Greater East Asia), the article likely presents Kyesaeng's life and work through a specific Japanese colonial lens. Historians might find the article interesting for its portrayal of a historical Korean female cultural figure by a Japanese writer during this period, potentially revealing attitudes towards Korean culture, history, and women within the framework of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere ideology.
