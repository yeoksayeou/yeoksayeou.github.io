To Chairman Kikuchi Kan From Kayama Mitsurō

To the Writers of Manchukuo From Yu Chin-o

To the Belorussian Writer, Old Mr. "Bakov" From Terada Ei
<48-55>

**Summary**

This section lists three letters written by participants returning from the Greater East Asia Writers' Conference held during WWII. The letters are addressed to key figures like the conference chairman Kikuchi Kan, fellow writers from Manchukuo (by Korean author Yu Chin-o), and a Belorussian writer. This reflects the structure and scope of Japan's wartime cultural diplomacy, attempting to unite writers from occupied and allied territories under the banner of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. For historians, the participation of figures like Yu Chin-o and the specific addresses (to Manchukuo writers, to a Belorussian writer) offer insights into the network Japan sought to build and the role assigned to colonial intellectuals within this imperial project.
