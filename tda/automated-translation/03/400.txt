Editorial Postscript

We have finally entered the decisive stage of the war. The American and British declarations of war against Japan have been issued, and the current great war truly presents the aspect of a world war. Depending on the outcome of this world war, we stand at a crossroads where either a new world order will be constructed or the old order will be maintained. The emotion of the Imperial subjects (皇國臣民), who bear the glory of participating in the Holy War (聖戰) which is the cornerstone of the construction of the new world order, is profound.

Our peninsula's twenty-five million people are also now cooperating with national policy and dedicating themselves in every field. Observing this situation, as we look back on more than a year of the Holy War, we cannot suppress the welling up of complete trust and conviction.

Entering the second year of the Holy War, we must further solidify the home front, push forward with patriotic increased food production, and bring the Greater East Asia War (大東亞戰爭) to completion as quickly as possible. Here and now, we renew our determination, commit ourselves thoroughly to the decisive battle lifestyle, and pledge to offer our total strength in service (御奉公).

This magazine is also determined to bear a part of this responsibility, exert its utmost effort, promote the self-awareness of being Imperial subjects, and thoroughly instill the significance of completing the Holy War. We earnestly desire the cooperation of our esteemed readers. (K)

**Summary**

This editorial postscript from March 1943 emphasizes that the war against the US and Britain has reached a critical "decisive stage." It calls upon the "twenty-five million people" of the Korean peninsula, framed as loyal "Imperial subjects" (皇國臣民), to fully support Japan's "Holy War" (聖戰) for a "New World Order." The piece stresses the need to strengthen the home front, particularly through increased food production, and expresses the magazine's commitment to reinforcing this wartime ideology and sense of duty among its readers. For historians, this text clearly illustrates the intensified propaganda and mobilization efforts directed at Koreans during the later stages of the Pacific War, portraying their required contributions not as colonial subjects but as integral members of the Japanese Empire fighting for a shared destiny. It highlights the rhetoric of total war, imperial subjecthood, and the specific demand for increased agricultural output.
