The Three Collapsing Enemy Capitals

Amidst the symphony of construction for the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere resounding throughout the vast expanse of East Asia, Washington, London, and Chongqing (重慶), the three capitals of our enemies, the United States, Britain, and Chiang Kai-shek's regime, are trembling in fear of imminent collapse, emitting groans of agony day by day. Especially Chongqing, which is not only facing military pressure from our Imperial Army but is also groaning under the triple torment of political instability, economic bankruptcy, and worsening public sentiment, presenting a truly miserable spectacle as it approaches its demise.

Ah, Chongqing! This city, stained with the blood and tears of the people, built upon their sacrifices, where Chiang Kai-shek, alongside treacherous elements, has nested like a venomous serpent. Chongqing is now starving. Chongqing is crying. The voices of the starving masses, crying out in hunger, resonate day and night throughout the mountainous city, and the resentment of the people towards Chiang Kai-shek's regime surges like boiling water. Let us first listen to the cries emanating from the depths of starvation in Chongqing.

Chongqing Crying from Hunger

<135>
Following the successive falls of Nanjing (南京), Hankou (漢口), and Guangzhou (廣州), the Chiang Kai-shek regime, fleeing deeper into the interior, established its temporary capital in Chongqing, Sichuan Province (四川省), located deep in the mountainous region. Relying on the geographical advantage of the steep mountains and the Yangtze River (揚子江), and depending solely on meager aid from the US and Britain channeled through the Burma Road and the Northwest route, they have continued their futile resistance against Japan for the past five years. However, with the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, their lifeline, the Burma Road, was completely severed by our Imperial Army. Furthermore, the transit route through Xinjiang (新疆) also became precarious due to the complex and subtle international situation. Consequently, Chongqing has been completely isolated, transforming into a solitary island deep in the mountains.

The military pressure exerted by our Imperial Army intensifies day by day, and coupled with the triple hardship of political, economic, and ideological instability, the suffering of the Chongqing populace has reached its peak. Especially dire is the food situation, which worsens daily, pushing the approximately 1.5 million residents of Chongqing, including refugees, to the brink of starvation.

Originally, Sichuan Province was known as a "heavenly endowed land" (天府の国), rich in products, and was considered self-sufficient. However, since becoming the temporary capital, the influx of military personnel, government officials, politicians, and refugees has caused the population to swell abnormally. Moreover, due to the conscription of peasants for military service and labor, agricultural production has drastically decreased. Adding to this, the exploitation by military cliques, the hoarding and black marketeering by unscrupulous merchants, and the rampant inflation have made it impossible for the general populace, especially the salaried class and refugees, to obtain food. Their tragic plight is beyond description.

<136>
Last fall, the food situation in Chongqing reached a critical point, with rice prices soaring uncontrollably. According to enemy reports, the price of rice per shi (石 - a unit of volume, approx. 180 liters) skyrocketed from 60-70 yuan just two or three years ago to 1,400-1,500 yuan. By the end of last year, it had further surged to 2,000 yuan, and entering this year, it surpassed 3,000 yuan. This is more than a fifty-fold increase compared to pre-incident levels. Other commodity prices have risen in tandem, plunging the lives of Chongqing's citizens into extreme hardship.

Faced with this critical food crisis, the Chongqing government has implemented various measures, such as establishing a Food Bureau (糧食部), enforcing compulsory grain purchases, implementing rationing, and regulating prices. However, due to corruption among officials, manipulation by grain merchants, and flawed policies, none of these measures have yielded significant results. Instead, they have only exacerbated the food shortage and deepened the suffering of the populace.

The compulsory grain purchase system, in particular, has become a means for officials and military personnel to exploit peasants, leading to widespread resentment. Peasants hide their grain or flee, resulting in deserted farmlands and a further decline in production. The rationing system is merely nominal, unable to provide sufficient food for the general public. Consequently, citizens must rely on the black market, where prices are exorbitant, leaving those without financial means, especially refugees and the salaried class, in a state of starvation.

<137>
Refugees who have fled into Chongqing wander the streets, collapsing from hunger, their plight truly heartbreaking. Salaried workers, unable to make ends meet with their meager incomes, struggle desperately to survive. Even middle-class citizens find it difficult to sustain their livelihoods. The cries of "Give us rice, give us food!" echo through the streets day and night, and riots and looting incidents occur frequently. The public sentiment is extremely agitated, and resentment towards the Chiang Kai-shek regime intensifies daily.

Recently, anti-Chiang Kai-shek and anti-war posters and leaflets have begun appearing frequently on the streets of Chongqing, reflecting the growing discontent among the populace. Slogans such as "Down with Chiang Kai-shek, who starves the people!", "Give us rice!", "We oppose the war of resistance that only benefits America and Britain!" are reportedly seen everywhere.

This dire food situation is not limited to Chongqing city but extends throughout the entire area under Chiang Kai-shek's control. Particularly in provinces like Sichuan, Yunnan (雲南), Guizhou (貴州), Hunan (湖南), and Guangdong (廣東), the food shortages are severe, and countless people are starving.

In contrast to this tragic situation in Chongqing, the conditions in areas liberated by the Imperial Army, such as Nanjing, Shanghai (上海), Hankou, and Guangzhou, are stable, with ample food supplies and improving public sentiment day by day. This stark contrast vividly demonstrates the difference between the path of co-existence and co-prosperity under the benevolent rule of the Empire and the path of exploitation and destruction under the US, Britain, and Chiang Kai-shek.

The cries of hunger from Chongqing are cries of despair directed at the Chiang Kai-shek regime. They are also pleas for salvation addressed to the Imperial Army of Japan. However, the Chongqing regime, prioritizing its own survival and interests, continues its futile resistance, sacrificing the populace. Furthermore, the US and Britain, preoccupied with their own war situations, show no concern for the suffering of the Chongqing people. Roosevelt and Churchill, while advocating for the "liberation of humanity" and "establishment of world peace," turn a blind eye to the tragic reality of Chongqing, where millions are starving. This hypocrisy clearly reveals their true nature.

The collapse of Chongqing is imminent. The cries of hunger signal the approaching end of the Chiang Kai-shek regime. The people of Chongqing, groaning under tyranny and starvation, eagerly await the arrival of the Imperial Army's righteous forces. The day when the banner of the Rising Sun will fly over the mountainous city of Chongqing, bringing light and hope to the suffering masses, is not far off.

**Summary**

This Japanese propaganda article from March 1943 portrays Chongqing, the wartime capital of Nationalist China, as being on the verge of collapse due to extreme food shortages, economic failure, and political instability. It contrasts the alleged suffering and starvation in Chongqing under Chiang Kai-shek, exacerbated by Allied indifference, with the supposed stability and prosperity in Japanese-occupied areas. The article aims to demoralize the Allies and justify Japan's war by depicting Chongqing as a city crying out from hunger and awaiting liberation by the Imperial Japanese Army. From the perspective of Korean colonial history, this article is significant as it exemplifies the type of propaganda disseminated during the war. It reinforced the narrative of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," suggesting that Japanese control brought stability and relief from the perceived failures and exploitation of Western powers and their allies like Chiang Kai-shek, thus legitimizing the immense sacrifices demanded of colonized Koreans for Japan's war effort.
