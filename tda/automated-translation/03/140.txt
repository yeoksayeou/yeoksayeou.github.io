"Daitōa" Relay Room, Relaying Special Information from Korea, the Mainland, and Other Regions <66-67>

**Summary**

This text is the title for a regular section or feature within the "Daitōa" magazine, identified as the "Relay Room." This section's purpose was to gather and disseminate "special information" (reports, news, potentially intelligence) from various parts of the Japanese Empire, specifically mentioning Korea, the Japanese mainland ("Naichi"), and other unspecified regions. From a historical perspective, this title illustrates the magazine's imperial scope and the perceived need to centralize information flow from across "Greater East Asia" during wartime. The reference to "special information" from places like Korea hints at the tightly controlled and potentially propagandistic nature of news dissemination during the colonial period, making it interesting for historians studying wartime information control and imperial communication networks.
