The "Pollock" Fishing Battle: From Sŏhojin in Hamhŭng South Province to the Winter Pollock Drying Racks and the Fishermen's Training Center Where They Gather, Its Valiant Scenery
A Reporter Dispatched by This Magazine

**Summary**

This article, published in March 1943, describes the pollock fishing industry in Sŏhojin, Hamhŭng South Province, during wartime Japan. It frames the intense winter fishing efforts as a "battle" (漁獲戰), highlighting scenes from the fishing grounds to the drying racks ("pollock mountain") and a fishermen's training center (漁民道場), emphasizing the "valiant scenery." From a historical perspective, the article is interesting as it clearly portrays colonial resource extraction (pollock fishing in Korea) explicitly linked to the Japanese war effort ("fishing battle"). The use of terms like "battle" and "valiant" serves as propaganda, glorifying labor mobilization in the colony for the empire's needs during the Pacific War. The mention of a "fishermen's training center" might also point to organized efforts to increase efficiency and control over this vital food resource.
