The World's Darkest Capital, A Broadcast by an English Journalist Who Saw It
<137>

**Summary**

This article title refers to a broadcast by an English journalist about the "World's Darkest Capital." Given the publication date (March 1943) and the magazine's title ("Greater East Asia"), the article likely presents Allied cities, possibly London during the Blitz or another major Allied capital, in a negative light as described by an alleged English observer. Historians might find this title indicative of Japanese wartime propaganda efforts aimed at demoralizing the enemy and portraying the Allied situation negatively, contrasting it implicitly or explicitly with conditions within the Japanese sphere.
