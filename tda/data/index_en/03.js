The lecture's title, \"Heaven Will Surely Side with Justice,\" delivered during the height of the Pacific War, strongly suggests it was a piece of wartime propaganda aimed at the Korean population, justifying Japan's war effort and reinforcing the ideology of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere under the banner of \"justice.\" For historians, the article (even just its title and context) is significant as it reflects the nature of Japanese propaganda disseminated in colonial Korea during the war, the co-option of concepts like \"justice\" for imperial aims, and the high-level figures involved in promoting the war effort directly to colonial subjects. The location (Keijō Civic Hall) indicates an attempt to reach a significant urban audience.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n朝鮮\tちょうせん\tChōsen (Korea)\n京城府民館\tけいじょうふみんかん\tKeijō Fumin-kan (Keijō [Seoul] Civic Hall)\n永井柳太郞\tながいりゅうたろう\tNagai Ryūtarō\n大政翼贊會\tたいせいよくさんかい\tTaisei Yokusankai (Imperial Rule Assistance Association)\n東亞局\tとうあきょく\tTōa-kyoku (East Asia Bureau)\n\n**Glossary**\n\n朝鮮\tちょうせん\tKorea (Used during the colonial period)\n來りて\tきたりて\tComing (Archaic/formal form of 来て, kite)\n京城\tけいじょう\tKeijō (Colonial name for Seoul)\n府民館\tふみんかん\tCivic Hall\n於ける\tおける\tAt; in; regarding (Used formally)\n講演\tこうえん\tLecture; address\n天\tてん\tHeaven; sky; providence\n必ず\tかならず\tSurely; certainly; without fail\n正義\tせいぎ\tJustice; righteousness\n與す\tくみす\tTo side with; support; participate in (Archaic/formal verb)\n速記\tそっき\tShorthand; stenography\n前\tぜん\tFormer; previous\n遞信大臣\tていしんだいじん\tMinister of Communications\n大政翼贊會\tたいせいよくさんかい\tImperial Rule Assistance Association (Wartime political organization)\n東亞\tとうあ\tEast Asia\n局長\tきょくちょう\tBureau Director\n論説\tろんせつ\tEditorial; discourse; commentary\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n잡지명\t대동아 제15권 제3호\n발행일\t1943년 03월 01일\n기사제목\t朝鮮に來りて, 京城府民館に於ける講演 『天必ず正義に與す』の速記\n필자\t前遞信大臣 大政翼贊會東亞局長 永井柳太郞\n기사형태\t논설\n\n朝鮮に來りて, 京城府民館に於ける講演 『天必ず正義に與す』の速記\n\t\t\t\t\t\t前遞信大臣 大政翼贊會東亞局長 永井柳太郞\n일본문-원문\n＜24-42, 145＞","magazine":"大東亞 第15巻 第3号","date":"1943-03-01","title":"Coming to Korea, Verbatim Record of the Lecture at the Gyeongseong Prefectural Hall \"Heaven Will Surely Side with Justice\"","author":"Former Minister of Communications, Director of the Greater Japan Political Association East Asia Bureau, Nagai Ryutaro"},{"path":"03/040.txt","issue":"03","content":"At Kwanghallu Pavilion in Namwŏn\nFormer Governor-General Saitō Makoto\n\nLong have I heard it's Honam's finest pavilion;\nOn tour, I happen to lean upon its winding railing.\nThe respected elders guiding me show such deep kindness;\nThe mountains and rivers entering my view are like a painting to be gathered.\nSnow, flowers, wind, moon – the scenes of the four seasons,\nNow as in ancient times, can console people's sorrows.\n\nAutumn, Shōwa 5 (1930) Kōsui\n\nFormer Chŏnbuk Governor Kim Sŏ-gyu\n\nNot merely Honam's finest pavilion;\nCompared across the entire land, it surely holds the top position.\nMinister Hwang's lingering influence permeates a hundred generations;\nCh'unhyang's noted traces remain cool through a thousand autumns.\nThe mountains and rivers are as before, yet people have greatly changed;\nLooking up and down, only the visitor's sorrow remains in vain.<27>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe article presents two classical Chinese poems about the famous Kwanghallu Pavilion in Namwŏn, Korea. The first, by former Japanese Governor-General Saitō Makoto (written in 1930), praises the pavilion's beauty, the surrounding scenery, and its timeless ability to soothe sorrow. The second, by former Korean provincial governor Kim Sŏ-gyu, echoes the praise but introduces a melancholic tone, reflecting on the enduring legacy of historical figures like Hwang Hŭi and Ch'unhyang associated with the pavilion, while lamenting the changes in human affairs contrasted with the unchanging landscape, leaving the visitor with a sense of sorrow. For historians, the juxtaposition of these poems is revealing: a high-ranking Japanese colonial official's seemingly appreciative yet detached view of Korean scenery versus a Korean official's more poignant reflection on cultural heritage and the passage of time under colonial rule, published together in a Japanese propaganda magazine (\"Greater East Asia\") during the height of the Pacific War. Kim's subtle expression of sorrow (`客子愁` - visitor's sorrow) takes on particular weight in this context.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n南原\t남원\tNamwŏn\n廣寒樓\t광한루\tKwanghallu Pavilion\n齋藤實\tさいとうまこと\tSaitō Makoto\n湖南\t호남\tHonam\n昭和\tしょうわ\tShōwa\n皐水\tこうすい\tKōsui (Saitō Makoto's pen name)\n金瑞圭\t김서규\tKim Sŏ-gyu\n全北\t전북\tChŏnbuk (North Chŏlla Province)\n黃相\t황상\tMinister Hwang (referring to Hwang Hŭi)\n春娘\t춘랑\tCh'unhyang\n\n**Glossary**\n\n第一樓\tだいいちろう\tNumber one pavilion / Finest pavilion\n巡遊\tじゅんゆう\tTour / Excursion\n偶\tたま\tBy chance / Incidentally\n倚\tよ（る）\tTo lean on / Rely on\n曲欄頭\tきょくらんとう\tHead of the winding railing\n耆宿\tきしゅく\tRespected elder / Senior figure\n殊厚\tしゅこう\tEspecially deep / Kind\n入眼\tじゅがん\tTo enter the eye / Come into view\n山川\tさんせん\tMountains and rivers / Landscape\n畵可收\tがかシュウ\tLike a painting that can be gathered / Picturesque\n四時景\tしじけい\tScenery of the four seasons\n慰愁\tいしゅう\tTo console sorrow / Comfort grief\n全邦\tぜんぽう\tThe entire land / The whole country\n位頭\tいとう\tTop position / First place\n遺風\tいふう\tLingering influence / Enduring legacy / Tradition\n湛\tたた（える）\tTo be full of / Permeate\n百世\tひゃくせい\tA hundred generations\n注蹟\tちゅうせき\tNoted traces / Marks left behind\n千秋\tせんしゅう\tA thousand autumns / Ages\n依舊\tいきゅう\tAs before / Unchanged\n俯仰\tふぎょう\tLooking up and down / Contemplation\n空餘\tくうよ\tTo remain in vain / Only remains\n客子愁\tかくしゅう\tTraveler's sorrow / Visitor's melancholy\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n잡지명\t대동아 제15권 제3호\n발행일\t1943년 03월 01일\n기사제목\t南原廣寒樓にて(其一)\n기사형태\t시\n\n南原廣寒樓にて\n前總督 齋藤實\n久耳湖南第一樓\n巡遊偶倚曲欄頭\n導吾耆宿情殊厚\n入眼山川畵可收\n雪花風月四時景\n今古使人能慰愁\n\n昭和 5年 秋 皐水\n\n前全北知事 金瑞圭\n非但湖南第一樓\n全邦爲較肯位頭\n黃相遺風湛百世\n春娘注蹟凉千秋\n山河依舊人多變\n俯仰空餘客子愁＜27＞\n＜27＞","magazine":"大東亞","date":"1943년 03월 01일 (March 1, 1943)","title":"At Namwon Gwanghallu (Part 1)"},{"path":"03/050.txt","issue":"03","content":"At Namwŏn Kwanghallu Pavilion\nFormer Chŏnbuk Governor Ko Wŏn-hun\n\nHyangnang Shrine (香娘祠) is warm, flowers like snow;\nHwangsang Gate (黃相門) is cool, grass evokes autumn.\nScattered misty light—I cannot capture it in verse;\nIt merely stirs idle sorrow in the traveler.\n\nShōwa Kōjutsu (甲戌), Pomegranate Summer (榴夏) [Summer 1934]\n\nFormer Hwanghae Governor Pak Sang-jun\n\nA place of refined elegance, and a famed pavilion too;\nA distant traveler, climbing late, laments his white hair.\nSpring is early, no flowers, fragrance does not linger;\nThe old castle walls, withered grass, add further to the sorrow.\n\nKōjutsu (甲戌), Early Spring (早春) [Early Spring 1934] <29>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe article presents two Classical Chinese poems composed by former Korean provincial governors, Ko Wŏn-hun (Chŏnbuk) and Pak Sang-jun (Hwanghae), during visits to the famous Kwanghallu Pavilion in Namwŏn in 1934.

Foreword\n\nThe world situation is rapidly changing day by day, hour by hour, toward the construction of a New World Order centered on Japan, Germany, and Italy. Our Japanese Empire, bearing the great responsibility for the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, is vigorously advancing toward the completion of the Greater East Asia War under the August Virtue of His Majesty the Emperor. In East Asia, the various peoples, liberated from the long-standing shackles and exploitation of Britain and America, are now marching mightily toward the construction of a New East Asia based on morality, hand in hand with Japan. This is truly a magnificent spectacle unprecedented in history. Korea (朝鮮), as part of the Empire, shares the same destiny as the mainland (内地). It goes without saying that the 24 million brethren of Korea must fulfill their duty as imperial subjects (皇国臣民) and bravely stand up to overcome this national crisis. The mission imposed upon Korea today is indeed grave and significant. Looking back, Korea, since the annexation (日韓合邦), under the benevolent imperial rule, has made remarkable progress in all aspects of politics, economy, culture, etc. The treatment of Koreans has dramatically improved compared to the past, especially with the recent implementation of the special volunteer soldier system (特別志願兵制度), the path has been opened for Koreans to fulfill the greatest duty of subjects, which is military service, and they can now participate in the sacred war as soldiers of the Imperial Army with the same qualifications as mainlanders. This is truly an epoch-making event and a matter of utmost joy for the Korean brethren. Furthermore, measures such as the encouragement of Japanese language use, the promotion of changing surnames and creating family names (氏姓創設), and the enforcement of worship at shrines (神社参拝) are all profound considerations aimed at nurturing and guiding Koreans as true imperial subjects. The Korean brethren must deeply understand this great sacred will, throw away their past dependence and inferiority complex, awaken to their mission as imperial subjects, and fulfill their duties perfectly.\n\n<44>\nII. Awakening as Imperial Subjects\n\nFor Koreans to perfectly fulfill their mission as imperial subjects, they must first fundamentally awaken as imperial subjects. While it is said that since the annexation, the treatment of Koreans has gradually improved, reaching the point where there is almost no difference compared to mainlanders today, it cannot be denied that in the past, there was a tendency for Koreans to be viewed as a separate people or treated differently. However, with the outbreak of the current Greater East Asia War, such distinctions have been completely eliminated. Koreans are truly imperial subjects, sharing life and death, joys and sorrows with the mainlanders. They are brothers and sisters who must cooperate for the prosperity of the Empire. There should be absolutely no discrimination or distinction between mainlanders and Koreans. The government authorities are also taking various measures based on this spirit. The aforementioned special volunteer soldier system is one example. It is truly moving to see young Koreans, burning with patriotism, volunteering for the battlefield one after another. This demonstrates that the spirit of imperial subjects has thoroughly permeated the Korean brethren. Furthermore, the government is planning to implement conscription (徴兵制度) in Korea in the future. This is also based on the idea that Koreans, as imperial subjects, should bear the duty of national defense just like mainlanders. The Korean brethren should feel boundless gratitude for this benevolent measure and must strive to become splendid imperial soldiers. Besides military service, Koreans also have a great mission in the economic field. Korea possesses abundant underground resources and vast arable land. Developing these resources and increasing food production is an urgent task for strengthening the Empire's national power. The Korean brethren must work diligently, endure hardships, and contribute to the expansion of production. Especially in the current situation where there is a labor shortage on the mainland, sending Korean labor to the mainland is an important mission. The Korean brethren must gladly respond to the nation's demands and fulfill their duty of labor service (勤労奉仕).\n\n<45>\nIII. Thorough Implementation of Imperial Subject Education\n\nTo make the Korean brethren fully awaken as imperial subjects and fulfill their mission, it is essential to thoroughly implement imperial subject education (皇民化教育). Imperial subject education means nurturing and guiding Koreans to become true Japanese subjects, both in name and reality. Specifically, it involves thoroughly instilling the Japanese spirit (日本精神), promoting the use of the national language (国語 - Japanese), and encouraging customs and manners suitable for imperial subjects. The Japanese spirit is the core of the imperial way (皇道) and the foundation of the Empire's national polity (国体). It is crucial to make the Korean brethren deeply understand this spirit and live according to it. Promoting the use of the national language is also extremely important for fostering a sense of unity between the mainland and Korea. If Koreans can freely use Japanese, mutual understanding with mainlanders will deepen, and the sense of being fellow countrymen will naturally arise. Changing surnames and creating family names is also an important measure for imperial subjectification (皇民化). By having Japanese-style surnames, Koreans can become Japanese subjects both in name and reality. Worshiping at shrines is an expression of reverence for the gods and ancestors, and it is a duty for imperial subjects. By encouraging shrine worship, we aim to cultivate the religious sentiments appropriate for imperial subjects among Koreans. These imperial subject education policies must be promoted even more vigorously in the future. Schools, social education organizations, religious groups, etc., must all cooperate and strive for the thorough implementation of imperial subject education. At the same time, it is necessary for mainlanders to have a correct understanding of Korea and Koreans and to treat them with warmth and guidance, without discrimination. True assimilation (真の内鮮一体) can only be achieved through mutual understanding and cooperation between mainlanders and Koreans.\n\n<46>\nIV. Strengthening the Wartime Livelihood System\n\nTo enable the Korean brethren to fulfill their mission in the decisive war, it is necessary to strengthen the wartime livelihood system (戦時生活体制) in Korea. The Greater East Asia War is a total war, requiring the mobilization of the entire nation's strength. Not only soldiers on the front lines but also the people on the home front (銃後) must unite and fight through this national crisis. In Korea as well, it is necessary to establish a strong wartime livelihood system and thoroughly implement measures such as saving consumption, increasing production, and strengthening air defense. Saving consumption is essential to secure resources necessary for war execution. The Korean brethren must eliminate extravagance, lead a simple and sturdy life, and cooperate in saving materials. Increasing production is the foundation for strengthening national power. Everyone must work diligently at their respective workplaces and strive to increase the production of munitions, food, etc. Especially, increasing food production is an important mission assigned to Korea. Strengthening air defense is necessary to protect lives and property from enemy air raids. Preparations such as establishing air defense organizations, conducting drills, and setting up shelters must be made thoroughly. Furthermore, it is important to maintain public order and prevent espionage activities. The Korean brethren must cooperate with the military and police authorities, be vigilant against suspicious individuals and rumors, and strive to maintain stability on the home front. Establishing this kind of strong wartime livelihood system requires the unity and cooperation of the entire Korean populace. Government authorities, public organizations, and the general public must unite as one and strive to strengthen the wartime system.\n\n<47>\nV. Conclusion\n\nThe mission imposed upon Korea today is extremely grave. The 24 million Korean brethren, as imperial subjects, must fully awaken to this mission and contribute to the completion of the Greater East Asia War. For this purpose, it is necessary to thoroughly implement imperial subject education, strengthen the wartime livelihood system, and strive for the true assimilation of the mainland and Korea (内鮮一体の実). The government authorities must promote appropriate policies with unwavering determination, and the Korean brethren must respond to this with gratitude and devotion (感恩奉公). Mainlanders must also treat Koreans with warmth and strive for mutual understanding and cooperation. Only when Japan and Korea unite as one, sharing life and death, joys and sorrows, can the prosperity of the Empire and the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere be achieved. I sincerely hope that the Korean brethren will deeply understand their new mission and bravely rise to the occasion.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis editorial by Tanaka Takeo, published in March 1943, outlines \"Korea's New Mission\" within the Japanese Empire during the height of the Greater East Asia War. It argues that Koreans, liberated from Western influence and benefiting from Japanese rule since annexation, must now fully embrace their identity as imperial subjects (皇国臣民) and share Japan's destiny. The article emphasizes the importance of assimilation policies like promoting Japanese language, name changes (氏姓創設), and shrine worship (神社参拝) as expressions of benevolent imperial guidance. It portrays the introduction of the special volunteer soldier system and the planned implementation of conscription as granting Koreans the honorable duty of military service, equivalent to mainland Japanese. The piece calls upon Koreans to contribute wholeheartedly to the war effort through labor service (勤労奉仕), increased production (especially food), resource development, consumption saving, and maintaining stability on the home front (銃後). The ultimate goal, according to the author, is the true assimilation of Japan and Korea (内鮮一体の実) through imperial subject education (皇民化教育) and shared sacrifice for the Empire's victory and the establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, this article is a clear example of Japanese wartime propaganda aimed at mobilizing the Korean population and justifying intensified assimilation policies. Historians would find interest in its framing of colonial policies (annexation, name changes, shrine worship) as benevolent acts, the explicit linking of Korean identity to imperial subjecthood and wartime duties (military service, labor), and the articulation of the ideal of \"Naissen Ittai\" (内鮮一体 - Japan-Korea as One Body) as a tool for total mobilization during the final, desperate years of the war. It starkly reveals the ideological pressure and practical demands placed upon Koreans under late-stage Japanese colonial rule.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n大東亞\tだいとうあ\tDaitōa (Greater East

These topics revolved around establishing and strengthening the \"Greater East Asia Spirit,\" cultural fusion, and utilizing literature to support Japan's war effort (\"Greater East Asia War\"). For historians, this piece is significant as it documents the public participation of leading Korean intellectuals like Yi Kwangsu (as Kōyama Mitsurō) and Pak Yŏnghŭi (as Yoshimura Kōgyaku) in a major Japanese wartime propaganda event, reflecting the complex pressures and collaborations during the late colonial period. The adoption of Japanese names and the pro-war themes illustrate the policy of *naisen ittai* (Japan and Korea as one body) and forced assimilation.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n香山光郞\tかやま みつろう\tKōyama Mitsurō\n李光洙\t이광수\tYi Kwangsu\n兪鎭午\tゆ じんご / 유진오\tYu Chino\n寺田瑛\tてらだ えい\tTerada Ei\n芳村香逆\tよしむら こうぎゃく\tYoshimura Kōgyaku\n朴英熙\t박영희\tPak Yŏnghŭi\n東京\tとうきょう\tTōkyō\n大東亞文學者大會\tだいとうあぶんがくしゃたいかい\tGreater East Asia Writers' Conference\n\n**Glossary**\n\n朝鮮側\tちょうせんがわ\tKorean side\n發言集\tはつげんしゅう\tCollection of statements/speeches\n中旬\tちゅうじゅん\tMiddle ten days of a month (mid-month)\n東京\tとうきょう\tTokyo\n於けゐ\tおける\t(Archaic/variant spelling of 於ける - おける) At, in, regarding\n大東亞\tだいとうあ\tGreater East Asia\n文學者\tぶんがくしゃ\tLiterary person, writer\n大會\tたいかい\tConference, convention, rally\n於いて\tおいて\tAt, in, regarding\n爲せゐ\tなせり\t(Classical form of 為す - なす) Did, made\n就いて\tついて\tRegarding, concerning\n精神\tせいしん\tSpirit, mind, soul\n樹立\tじゅりつ\tEstablishment, founding\n强化\tきょうか\tStrengthening, intensification (older form of 強化)\n普及\tふきゅう\tDiffusion, spread, propagation\n文學\tぶんがく\tLiterature (older form of 文学)\n民族\tみんぞく\tPeople (as in ethnic group), race, nation\n國家\tこっか\tNation, state, country (older form of 国家)\n間\tかん\tBetween, among\n思想\tしそう\tThought, idea, ideology\n文化\tぶんか\tCulture\n融合\tゆうごう\tFusion, blending, merging\n圖る\tはかる\tTo plan, to attempt, to devise (older form of 図る)\n方法\tほうほう\tMethod, way, means\nよる\tよる\tBy means of, due to, through\n戰\tせん\tWar, battle (older form of 戦)\n完遂\tかんすい\tCompletion, accomplishment\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n잡지명\t대동아 제15권 제3호\n발행일\t1943년 03월 01일\n기사제목\t朝鮮側の發言集, 11月中旬東京に於けゐ大東亞文學者大會に於いて爲せゐ朝鮮側の發言集\n기사형태\t논설\n\n朝鮮側の發言集, 11月中旬東京に於けゐ大東亞文學者大會に於いて爲せゐ朝鮮側の發言集\n일본문-원문\n\n「大東亞精神の樹立」に就いて\n香山光郞(舊名 李光洙)\n\n「大東亞精神の强化普及」に就いて\n兪鎭午\n\n「文學民族及國家間の思想文化の融合を圖る方法」に就いて 寺田瑛\n\n「文學による大東亞戰完遂の方法」に就いて\n芳村香逆(舊名 朴英熙)\n＜48-55＞","magazine":"大東亞","date":"March 1, 1943","title":"Collection of Statements from the Korean Side: Collection of Statements Made by the Korean Side at the Greater East Asia Literary Assembly Held in Tokyo in Mid-November"},{"path":"03/080.txt","issue":"03","content":"To Chairman Kikuchi Kan From Kayama Mitsurō\n\nTo the Writers of Manchukuo From Yu Chin-o\n\nTo the Belorussian Writer, Old Mr. \"Bakov\" From Terada Ei\n<48-55>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis section lists three letters written by participants returning from the Greater East Asia Writers' Conference held during WWII. The letters are addressed to key figures like the conference chairman Kikuchi Kan, fellow writers from Manchukuo (by Korean author Yu Chin-o), and a Belorussian writer. This reflects the structure and scope of Japan's wartime cultural diplomacy, attempting to unite writers from occupied and allied territories under the banner of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

Although the body text is not provided, the title indicates a focus on the medical understanding and treatment of tuberculosis, particularly its prevalence during cold weather, addressing early detection and therapy. From a historical perspective, the article is interesting as it reflects public health concerns, specifically regarding a major infectious disease like tuberculosis, within the Japanese empire (including colonial Korea) during the demanding period of World War II.

The title suggests a narrative focused on overcoming long-standing health problems, specifically digestive issues and neurasthenia (a common diagnosis at the time, often encompassing symptoms like fatigue, anxiety, and depression). From a historical perspective, such personal health narratives in a wartime publication might reflect broader societal concerns about health, resilience, and overcoming weakness. The diagnosis of neurasthenia (神經衰弱) itself is interesting, as it was frequently linked to the stresses of modern life and could provide insights into the perceived psychological pressures of the era, potentially within the colonial context if the author's background related to Korea or other parts of the Japanese empire.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n荒川梅治\tあらかわ うめじ\tArakawa Umeji\n\n**Glossary**\n\n實話\tじつわ\tTrue story, real account\n痼疾\tこしつ\tChronic disease, longstanding illness\n胃腸病\tいちょうびょう\tGastrointestinal disease, stomach and intestinal problems\n神經衰弱\tしんけいすいじゃく\tNeurasthenia, nervous breakdown (a common historical diagnosis)\n治療\tちりょう\tTreatment, cure, therapy\n雜저\tざっちょ\tMiscellaneous writing, essay (using the older form 著 for ちょ)\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n잡지명\t대동아 제15권 제3호\n발행일\t1943년 03월 01일\n기사제목\t實話, 痼疾の胃腸病と神經衰弱を治療\n필자\t荒川梅治\n기사형태\t잡저\n\n實話, 痼疾の胃腸病と神經衰弱を治療\n\t\t\t\t\t\t荒川梅治\n일본문-원문\n＜57＞","magazine":"大東亞 第十五卷 第三號","date":"1943年 03月 01日","title":"True Story: Treating Chronic Gastrointestinal Illness and Neurasthenia","author":"Arakawa Umeji"},{"path":"03/110.txt","issue":"03","content":"**Body Text Translation:**\nRecord of Visits to the Governors of the Thirteen Provinces\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbe Eiji\n<58-60, 155>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis article appears to be the first in a series by Abe Eiji, documenting interviews with the governors of Korea's thirteen provinces in 1943. This specific installment features an interview or discussion with Governor Kō (高) of Kyŏnggi Province (京畿道), focusing on his leadership style described as \"taking command at the front.\" For historians, the article likely offers insights into the wartime administration of colonial Korea, the perspectives of high-ranking Japanese or pro-Japanese officials like the governor, and the rhetoric surrounding mobilization and leadership during a critical phase of the Pacific War.

From a historical perspective, this title illustrates the magazine's imperial scope and the perceived need to centralize information flow from across \"Greater East Asia\" during wartime.

The perspectives of the Korean authors on these figures could be particularly revealing about cultural life and inter-ethnic relations during the late colonial period.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n府民舘\tふみんかん\tFumin-kan (Keijō Civic Hall)\n永井\tながい\tNagai\n朱雲成\t주운성\tChu Un-sŏng\n京城博物館\tけいじょうはくぶつかん\tKeijō Museum\nバイコフ翁\tばいこふおう\tOld Man Baikov / Elder Baikov\n牧洋\t목양\tMak Yang\n李石薰\t이석훈\tYi Sŏk-hun\n\n**Glossary**\n\n來鮮\tらいせん\tComing to Korea (Chōsen)\n賓客\tひんきゃく\tGuest; visitor\n印象\tいんしょう\tImpression\n府民舘\tふみんかん\tCivic Hall (specifically the Keijō Fumin-kan)\n立つた\tたった\tStood (past tense of 立つ; older kana usage for たった)\n京城\tけいじょう\tKeijō (Colonial Japanese name for Seoul)\n博物館\tはくぶつかん\tMuseum\n翁\tおう\tOld man; elder (respectful suffix)\n舊名\tきゅうめい\tFormer name\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n잡지명\t대동아 제15권 제3호\n발행일\t1943년 03월 01일\n기사제목\t來鮮賓客の印象\n기사형태\t회고·수기\n\n來鮮賓客の印象\n일본문-원문\n府民舘に立つた永井さん\n朱雲成\n\n京城博物館のバイコフ翁 牧洋(舊名 李石薰)\n＜68-79＞","magazine":"大東亜 第15巻 第3号","date":"1943-03-01","title":"Impressions of Visiting Guests to Korea"},{"path":"03/160.txt","issue":"03","content":"<80-81> [The body text of the article from pages 80-81 was not provided in the prompt.

The lecture likely discussed the implementation of the conscription system for Koreans (referred to as \"Peninsula Compatriots\") and expressed gratitude for this policy. It probably framed conscription as a duty and honor for Koreans, integrating them further into the Japanese Empire during the wartime mobilization for the Greater East Asia War. For historians, this article provides insight into Japanese propaganda efforts aimed at justifying and promoting the controversial conscription of Koreans, portraying it as a beneficial step towards imperial unity and shared sacrifice, as viewed through the lens of a Japanese official involved in colonial affairs.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n半島\tはんとう\tHantō (Korean Peninsula)\n大阪\tおおさか\tŌsaka\n丸山鶴吉\tまるやま つるきち\tMaruyama Tsurukichi\n\n**Glossary**\n\n大東亞\tだいとうあ\tGreater East Asia\n半島\tはんとう\tPeninsula (referring to Korea)\n同胞\tどうほう\tCompatriots; brethren\n徵兵\tちょうへい\tConscription; draft\n大阪\tおおさか\tOsaka (city name)\n於けゐ\tおける\t(older kana spelling) In; at; regarding\n實施\tじっし\tImplementation; enforcement\n感謝\tかんしゃ\tGratitude; thanks\n講演\tこうえん\tLecture; address\n要旨\tようし\tSummary; gist; main points\n論説\tろんせつ\tEditorial; opinion piece; discourse\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n잡지명\t대동아 제15권 제3호\n발행일\t1943년 03월 01일\n기사제목\t半島同胞と徵兵, 大阪に於けゐ徵兵實施感謝講演要旨\n필자\t丸山鶴吉\n기사형태\t논설\n\n半島同胞と徵兵, 大阪に於けゐ徵兵實施感謝講演要旨\n\t\t\t\t\t\t丸山鶴吉\n일본문-원문\n＜80-81＞","magazine":"大東亞 第十五巻 第三號","date":"1943-03-01","title":"Koreans and Conscription: Summary of a Lecture Thanking Conscription Implementation in Osaka","author":"Maruyama Tsurukichi"},{"path":"03/170.txt","issue":"03","content":"<82>\n\nLocal Special Feature: Roundtable Discussion of \"Peninsula People\" in Nanjing, Discussing Development Strategies for Peninsula People in Nanjing\n\n<83>\n<84>\n<85>\n<86>\n<87>\n<88>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis article, based solely on its title and metadata, reports on a roundtable discussion held in Nanjing featuring Koreans (\"Peninsula People\").

It focuses primarily on individuals active in the financial and business world, listing their names, ages, provinces of origin, company names, and business activities. It briefly acknowledges Koreans active in other fields like education, religion, medicine, arts, and labor but omits detailed profiles due to space constraints. The list showcases a significant number of Korean entrepreneurs engaged in diverse trades, including textiles, trading, shipping, groceries, pharmaceuticals, and more, highlighting their economic integration and activity within Japanese-occupied Shanghai during the war.\n\nFrom the perspective of Korean colonial history, the article is revealing in its portrayal of a seemingly thriving Korean business community in Shanghai under Japanese rule. Published in a Japanese magazine promoting the \"Greater East Asia\" concept, it implicitly presents these Koreans as successful participants within the imperial economic sphere. Historians might find the sheer number of listed individuals, their diverse business activities, and their origins (predominantly from northern and southern provinces) useful for studying Korean migration patterns, economic adaptation strategies under colonialism, and the complex relationship between collaboration, entrepreneurship, and survival within the Japanese empire. The existence of organizations like the Korean Residents' Association (朝鮮人居留民団) and the Mutual Prosperity Association (共栄会) also points to community organization within the colonial structure.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n上海\tシャンハイ\tShanghai\n李甲柱\tイ・カプチュ\tYi Kapchu\n大同産業会社\tだいどうさんぎょうかいしゃ\tTaedong Industrial Company\n共栄会\tきょうえいかい\tMutual Prosperity Association

directors, department heads, and committee members of the Shanghai Kyerim Association (上海鷄林會) as of March 1943. The association is described as the \"only Peninsular people's (Korean) organization\" in Shanghai. High-ranking Japanese officials from the Residents' Association, Embassy, Consulate-General, Government-General of Korea, and Consular Police serve as advisors, indicating strong official oversight. The list primarily consists of individuals with Japanese-style names, likely Koreans who adopted them under the *Sōshi-kaimei* policy.\n\nFrom the perspective of Korean colonial history, this article is revealing. It documents the existence and structure of a Japanese-sanctioned Korean community organization in occupied Shanghai during the height of the Pacific War. The heavy presence of Japanese advisors and the use of Japanese-style names by Korean members illustrate the pervasive control and assimilation policies of the Japanese Empire. Historians might find the roster valuable for studying collaboration, community organization under occupation, the *Sōshi-kaimei* policy's implementation abroad, and the relationship between the Korean diaspora and Japanese authorities in China. The departmental structure (especially the \"Training Department\" - 錬成部) also hints at wartime mobilization efforts within the community.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n上海\t상해\tShanghai\n鷄林會\t계림회\tKyerimhoe (Kyerim Association)\n上海 居留民團\t상해 거류민단\tShanghai Japanese Residents' Association\n大使館\t대사관\tEmbassy\n總領事館\t총영사관\tConsulate-General\n朝鮮總督府\t조선총독부\tGovernment-General of Korea\n金澤秀雄\t김택수웅\tKim T'aek Su-ung\n靖原甲寧\t정원갑녕\tChŏng Wŏn Kap-nyŏng\n孫田昌植\t손전창식\tSon Chŏn Ch'ang-sik\n江鴻命石\t강홍명석\tKang Hong Myŏng-sŏk\n金海河鍾\t김해하종\tKimhae Ha Chong\n平田在福\t평전재복\tP'yŏng Chŏn Chae-bok\n村井惠\t촌정혜\tCh'on Chŏng Hye\n玄谷正柱\t현곡정주\tHyŏn Kok Chŏng-ju\n高島輝三\t고도휘삼\tKo To Hwi-sam\n南宮赫\t남궁혁\tNamgung Hyŏk\n松村元雄\t송촌원웅\tSong Ch'on Wŏn-ung\n方由老元\t방유노원\tPang Yu No-wŏn\n入部俊夫\t입부준부\tIp Pu Chun-bu\n坪井盤松\t평정반송\tP'yŏng Chŏng Pan-song\n林承業\t임승업\tIm Sŭng-ŏp\n韓田奎光\t한전규광\tHan Chŏn Kyu-gwang\n金株龍河\t김주용하\tKim Chu Yong-ha\n崔金元慶\t최금원경\tCh'oe Kŭm Wŏn-gyŏng\n金城龍河\t김성용하\tKim Sŏng Yong-ha [Note: Different from 金株龍河]\n岩本秀夫\t암본수부\tAm Pon Su-bu\n石川淸吉\t석천청길\tSŏk Ch'ŏn Ch'ŏng-gil\n豊由靖三\t풍유정삼\tP'ung Yu Chŏng-sam\n文氷鍾鍋\t문빙종과\tMun Ping Chong-gwa\n山平景生\t산평경생\tSan P'yŏng Kyŏng-saeng\n片山在濬\t편산재준\tP'yŏn San Chae-jun\n大山啓治\t대산계치\tTae San Kye-ch'i\n靑木秀夫\t청목수부\tCh'ŏng Mok Su-bu\n南一誠\t남일성\tNam Il-sŏng\n西原泰熙\t서원태희\tSŏ Wŏn T'ae-hŭi\n兪奇錫\t유기석\tYu Ki-sŏk\n洪魚吉\t홍어길\tHong Ŏ-gil\n伊籐大輔\t이등대보\tI T'ŭng Tae-bo\n方由宣弘\t방유선홍\tPang Yu Sŏn-hong\n月山\t월산\tWŏl San\n金田明水\t김전명수\tKim Chŏn Myŏng-su\n宇島崇夫\t우도숭부\tU To Sung-bu\n朴巨影\t박거영\tPak Kŏ-yŏng\n柳用有吉\t유용유길\tYu Yong Yu-gil\n南宮堯\t남궁요\tNamgung Yo\n和田宗\t화전종\tHwa Chŏn Chong\n金谷炳道\t김곡병도\tKim Kok Pyŏng-do\n柳義卓\t유의탁\tYu Ŭi-t'ak\n吉田光莊\t길전광장\tKil Chŏn Kwang-jang\n廣木徾\t광목미\tKwang Mok Mi (assuming 徾 is 微)\n大丘正雄\t대구정웅\tTae Ku Chŏng-ung\n長谷用美宰\t장곡용미재\tChang Kok Yong Mi-jae\n木村建宰\t목촌건재\tMok Ch'on Kŏn-jae\n桂春舞\t계춘무\tKye Ch'un-mu\n\n**Glossary**\n\n잡지명\t잡지명\tMagazine Title\n발행일\t발행일\tPublication Date\n기사제목\t기사제목\tArticle Title\n기사형태\t기사형태\tArticle Type\n소식\t소식\tNews; Tidings; Information (often a brief news item)\n鷄林會\t계림회\tKyerim Association (鷄林 Kyerim is an ancient name for Silla/Korea)\n陣容\t진용\tLineup; Roster; Formation\n唯一\t유일\tOnly; Sole; Unique\n半島人\t반도인\tPeninsular people (Term used during the colonial era, primarily by Japanese, to refer to Koreans)\n團體\t단체\tOrganization; Group; Body\n役員\t임원\tOfficer; Official; Executive member\n顧問\t고문\tAdvisor; Consultant\n居留民團長\t거류민단장\tHead of the Residents' Association (specifically referring to Japanese residents abroad)\n大使館\t대사관\tEmbassy\n警務部\t경무부\tPolice Affairs Department\n課長\t과장\tSection Chief; Department Manager\n總領事館\t총영사관\tConsulate-General\n行政部長\t행정부장\tHead of Administrative Department\n朝鮮總督府\t조선총독부\tGovernment-General of Korea (Japanese colonial ruling body)\n派遺\t파견\tDispatch; Send\n事務官\t사무관\tAdministrative Official; Secretary\n警察署長\t경찰서장\tChief of Police Station\n評議員\t평의원\tCouncilor; Member of a council\n理事長\t이사장\tChairman of the Board; President (of an association)\n副理事長\t부이사장\tVice-Chairman of the Board\n理事\t이사\tDirector; Board Member\n總務部\t총무부\tGeneral Affairs Department\n錬成部\t연성부\tTraining Department; Discipline Department (錬成 implies forging, tempering, training - often used in militaristic/nationalistic contexts)\n文化部\t문화부\tCulture Department\n厚生部\t후생부\tWelfare Department; Health and Welfare Department\n書記長\t서기장\tChief Secretary; Secretary-General\n委員\t위원\tCommittee Member\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n잡지명\t대동아 제15권 제3호\n발행일\t1943년 03월 01일\n기사제목\t上海鷄林會陣容, 唯一の半島人團體\n기사형태\t소식\n\n上海鷄林會陣容, 唯一の半島人團體\n役員\n顧問\n上海 居留民團長\n大使館 警務部 第2課長\n在上海 總領事館 行政部長\n朝鮮總督府派遺事務官\n上海總領事館警察署長\n評議員 金澤秀雄, 靖原甲寧, 孫田昌植\n理事長 江鴻命石\n副理事長 金海河鍾\n理事\n金海河鍾, 平田在福, 村井惠, 江鴻命石, 玄谷正柱, 高島輝三, 南宮赫, 松村元雄, 方由老元,\n入部俊夫, 坪井盤松, 林承業, 韓田奎光, 金株龍河, 崔金元慶 (以上 15名)\n總務部長 松村元雄\n鋉成部長 玄谷正柱\n文化部長 平田在福\n厚生部長 金城龍河\n書記長 岩本秀夫\n總務部 委員 石川淸吉, 豊由靖三, 文氷鍾鍋, 山平景生, 片山在濬, 大山啓治, 靑木秀夫\n錬成部 委員 南一誠, 西原泰熙, 兪奇錫, 洪魚吉, 伊籐大輔, 方由宣弘, 月山\n文化部 委員 金田明水, 宇島崇夫, 朴巨影, 柳用有吉, 南宮堯, 和田宗, 金谷炳道\n厚生部 委員 柳義卓, 吉田光莊, 廣木徾, 大丘正雄, 長谷用美宰, 木村建宰, 桂春舞\n(以上) ＜99＞","magazine":"大東亞","date":"1943-03-01","title":"Shanghai Gyrin Society Lineup: The Only Korean Organization"},{"path":"03/210.txt","issue":"03","content":"<102-105>\nProfiles of Nanjing Industrialists, Observing the Activities of Peninsula People on the Scene\nBy Pak Kŏ-yŏng (朴巨影), Daitōa Company Special Correspondent for Central China\n\n[Translation of the main text content would go here if provided.

The second, by Ri Shokyō (Yi Sŏhyang), discusses Gerhart Hauptmann, focusing on his play \"Hannele's Ascension\" (\"Hannele\") among others. For colonial historians, the presence of two Korean directors (affiliated with the Gendai Gekijō/Hyundai Theatre and Tōyō Gekijō/Dongyang Theatre) writing literary/theatrical criticism in Japanese about canonical European plays within a major Japanese magazine during the height of the Pacific War is noteworthy. It reflects the complex cultural dynamics of the period, showing Korean intellectuals participating in Japanese cultural life and engaging with Western culture, potentially indicating assimilation, shared artistic interests within the empire, or opportunities for Korean cultural figures within the Japanese sphere.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n朱永涉\t주영섭\tShu Eishō (Chu Yŏngsŏp)\n現代劇場\t현대극장\tGendai Gekijō (Hyundai Theatre)\n李曙鄕\t이서향\tRi Shokyō (Yi Sŏhyang)\n東洋劇場\t동양극장\tTōyō Gekijō (Dongyang Theatre)\n東京\t도쿄\tTokyo\n國民小劇場\t국민소극장\tKokumin Shōgekijō (National Small Theater)\nハウプトマン\t하우프트만\tHauptmann (Gerhart Hauptmann)\nハンネレの昇天\t한넬레의 승천\tHannerre no Shōten (Hannele's Ascension / Hannele)\nフアウスト\t파우스트\tFaust\n\n**Glossary**\n\n思ひ出\tおもいで\tMemory; Recollection (Older kana spelling of 思い出)\n名劇\tめいげき\tMasterpiece play\n舞臺\tぶたい\tStage (Older Kanji form of 舞台)\n於ける\tにおける\tIn; At; Regarding (Written form of における)\n演出家\tえんしゅつか\tTheatrical director\n其他\tそのた\tOthers; And others (Older written form of その他)\n文芸評論\tぶんげいひょうろん\tLiterary criticism\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n잡지명\t대동아 제15권 제3호\n발행일\t1943년 03월 01일\n기사제목\t思ひ出の名劇\n기사형태\t문예평론\n\n思ひ出の名劇\n일본문-원문\n\n「フアウスト」の舞臺-東京の國民小劇場に於ける\n朱永涉(前現代劇場演出家)\n\n「ハウプトマン」のことなど-「ハンネレの昇天」其他\n李曙鄕(東洋劇場演出家)\n＜122-125, 151＞","magazine":"大東亞 第15巻 第3号","date":"1943年 03月 01日","title":"Memorable Masterpieces"},{"path":"03/250.txt","issue":"03","content":"<126-130>\n[Translator's Note: The main body text of the article spanning pages 126-130 was not provided in the input.

The article frames this industrial activity within the context of Japan's war against the United States and Britain (\"War to Annihilate America and Britain\") and positions it as part of Korea's contribution to the wartime industrial mobilization. For historians, this article title is interesting as it explicitly links Korean industrial labor (shipbuilding in Incheon) directly to Japan's Pacific War effort (米英擊滅戰) and uses the term \"Peninsula workers\" (半島職工), reflecting the colonial context and mobilization of Korean manpower for Japanese wartime industries.

Especially Chongqing, which is not only facing military pressure from our Imperial Army but is also groaning under the triple torment of political instability, economic bankruptcy, and worsening public sentiment, presenting a truly miserable spectacle as it approaches its demise.\n\nAh, Chongqing! This city, stained with the blood and tears of the people, built upon their sacrifices, where Chiang Kai-shek, alongside treacherous elements, has nested like a venomous serpent. Chongqing is now starving. Chongqing is crying. The voices of the starving masses, crying out in hunger, resonate day and night throughout the mountainous city, and the resentment of the people towards Chiang Kai-shek's regime surges like boiling water. Let us first listen to the cries emanating from the depths of starvation in Chongqing.\n\nChongqing Crying from Hunger\n\n<135>\nFollowing the successive falls of Nanjing (南京), Hankou (漢口), and Guangzhou (廣州), the Chiang Kai-shek regime, fleeing deeper into the interior, established its temporary capital in Chongqing, Sichuan Province (四川省), located deep in the mountainous region. Relying on the geographical advantage of the steep mountains and the Yangtze River (揚子江), and depending solely on meager aid from the US and Britain channeled through the Burma Road and the Northwest route, they have continued their futile resistance against Japan for the past five years. However, with the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, their lifeline, the Burma Road, was completely severed by our Imperial Army. Furthermore, the transit route through Xinjiang (新疆) also became precarious due to the complex and subtle international situation. Consequently, Chongqing has been completely isolated, transforming into a solitary island deep in the mountains.\n\nThe military pressure exerted by our Imperial Army intensifies day by day, and coupled with the triple hardship of political, economic, and ideological instability, the suffering of the Chongqing populace has reached its peak. Especially dire is the food situation, which worsens daily, pushing the approximately 1.5 million residents of Chongqing, including refugees, to the brink of starvation.\n\nOriginally, Sichuan Province was known as a \"heavenly endowed land\" (天府の国), rich in products, and was considered self-sufficient. However, since becoming the temporary capital, the influx of military personnel, government officials, politicians, and refugees has caused the population to swell abnormally. Moreover, due to the conscription of peasants for military service and labor, agricultural production has drastically decreased. Adding to this, the exploitation by military cliques, the hoarding and black marketeering by unscrupulous merchants, and the rampant inflation have made it impossible for the general populace, especially the salaried class and refugees, to obtain food. Their tragic plight is beyond description.\n\n<136>\nLast fall, the food situation in Chongqing reached a critical point, with rice prices soaring uncontrollably. According to enemy reports, the price of rice per shi (石 - a unit of volume, approx. 180 liters) skyrocketed from 60-70 yuan just two or three years ago to 1,400-1,500 yuan. By the end of last year, it had further surged to 2,000 yuan, and entering this year, it surpassed 3,000 yuan. This is more than a fifty-fold increase compared to pre-incident levels. Other commodity prices have risen in tandem, plunging the lives of Chongqing's citizens into extreme hardship.\n\nFaced with this critical food crisis, the Chongqing government has implemented various measures, such as establishing a Food Bureau (糧食部), enforcing compulsory grain purchases, implementing rationing, and regulating prices. However, due to corruption among officials, manipulation by grain merchants, and flawed policies, none of these measures have yielded significant results. Instead, they have only exacerbated the food shortage and deepened the suffering of the populace.\n\nThe compulsory grain purchase system, in particular, has become a means for officials and military personnel to exploit peasants, leading to widespread resentment. Peasants hide their grain or flee, resulting in deserted farmlands and a further decline in production. The rationing system is merely nominal, unable to provide sufficient food for the general public. Consequently, citizens must rely on the black market, where prices are exorbitant, leaving those without financial means, especially refugees and the salaried class, in a state of starvation.\n\n<137>\nRefugees who have fled into Chongqing wander the streets, collapsing from hunger, their plight truly heartbreaking. Salaried workers, unable to make ends meet with their meager incomes, struggle desperately to survive. Even middle-class citizens find it difficult to sustain their livelihoods. The cries of \"Give us rice, give us food!\" echo through the streets day and night, and riots and looting incidents occur frequently. The public sentiment is extremely agitated, and resentment towards the Chiang Kai-shek regime intensifies daily.\n\nRecently, anti-Chiang Kai-shek and anti-war posters and leaflets have begun appearing frequently on the streets of Chongqing, reflecting the growing discontent among the populace. Slogans such as \"Down with Chiang Kai-shek, who starves the people!\", \"Give us rice!\", \"We oppose the war of resistance that only benefits America and Britain!\" are reportedly seen everywhere.\n\nThis dire food situation is not limited to Chongqing city but extends throughout the entire area under Chiang Kai-shek's control. Particularly in provinces like Sichuan, Yunnan (雲南), Guizhou (貴州), Hunan (湖南), and Guangdong (廣東), the food shortages are severe, and countless people are starving.\n\nIn contrast to this tragic situation in Chongqing, the conditions in areas liberated by the Imperial Army, such as Nanjing, Shanghai (上海), Hankou, and Guangzhou, are stable, with ample food supplies and improving public sentiment day by day. This stark contrast vividly demonstrates the difference between the path of co-existence and co-prosperity under the benevolent rule of the Empire and the path of exploitation and destruction under the US, Britain, and Chiang Kai-shek.\n\n<138>\nThe cries of hunger from Chongqing are cries of despair directed at the Chiang Kai-shek regime. They are also pleas for salvation addressed to the Imperial Army of Japan. However, the Chongqing regime, prioritizing its own survival and interests, continues its futile resistance, sacrificing the populace. Furthermore, the US and Britain, preoccupied with their own war situations, show no concern for the suffering of the Chongqing people. Roosevelt and Churchill, while advocating for the \"liberation of humanity\" and \"establishment of world peace,\" turn a blind eye to the tragic reality of Chongqing, where millions are starving. This hypocrisy clearly reveals their true nature.\n\nThe collapse of Chongqing is imminent. The cries of hunger signal the approaching end of the Chiang Kai-shek regime. The people of Chongqing, groaning under tyranny and starvation, eagerly await the arrival of the Imperial Army's righteous forces. The day when the banner of the Rising Sun will fly over the mountainous city of Chongqing, bringing light and hope to the suffering masses, is not far off.\n\n(Image: Caricature of Allied leaders - Roosevelt, Churchill, Chiang Kai-shek)\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis Japanese propaganda article from March 1943 portrays Chongqing, the wartime capital of Nationalist China, as being on the verge of collapse due to extreme food shortages, economic failure, and political instability. It contrasts the alleged suffering and starvation in Chongqing under Chiang Kai-shek, exacerbated by Allied indifference, with the supposed stability and prosperity in Japanese-occupied areas. The article aims to demoralize the Allies and justify Japan's war by depicting Chongqing as a city crying out from hunger and awaiting liberation by the Imperial Japanese Army. From the perspective of Korean colonial history, this article is significant as it exemplifies the type of propaganda disseminated during the war. It reinforced the narrative of the \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere,\" suggesting that Japanese control brought stability and relief from the perceived failures and exploitation of Western powers and their allies like Chiang Kai-shek, thus legitimizing the immense sacrifices demanded of colonized Koreans for Japan's war effort.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\nワシントン\tワシントン\tWashington\nロンドン\tロンドン\tLondon\n重慶\tじゅうけい\tChūkei\n米国\tべいこく\tUnited States\n英国\tえいこく\tBritain\n蔣介石\tしょうかいせき\tChiang Kai-shek (Shō Kaiseki)\n南京\tなんきん\tNanjing (Nankin)\n漢口\tかんこう\tHankou (Kankō)\n廣州\tこうしゅう\tGuangzhou (Kōshū)\n四川省\tしせんしょう\tSichuan Province (Shisenshō)\n揚子江\tようすこう\tYangtze River (Yōsukō)\nビルマ・ルート\tビルマ・ルート\tBurma Road\n新疆\tしんきょう\tXinjiang (Shinkyō)\n糧食部\tりょうしょくぶ\tFood Bureau (Ryōshokubu)\n雲南\tうんなん\tYunnan\n貴州\tきしゅう\tGuizhou (Kishū)\n湖南\tこなん\tHunan (Konan)\n廣東\tかんとん\tGuangdong (Kanton)\n上海\tしゃんはい\tShanghai\nルーズヴェルト\tルーズヴェルト\tRoosevelt\nチャーチル\tチャーチル\tChurchill\n日本\tにっぽん\tJapan\n\n**Glossary**\n\n崩壞すゐ\tほうかいすい\tTo collapse (older grammatical form すゐ for する)\n敵\tてき\tEnemy\n首都\tしゅと\tCapital city\n飢へ\tうえ\tHunger, starvation (older kana へ used for え)\n泣く\tなく\tTo cry\n大東亞共榮圈\tだいとうあきょうえいけん\tGreater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\n建設\tけんせつ\tConstruction\n呻吟\tしんぎん\tGroan, moan\n戰雲\tせんうん\tWar clouds, fear of war\n崩潰\tほうかい\tCollapse, crumble (synonym for 崩壊)\n塗炭の苦しみ\tとたんのくるしみ\tExtreme suffering, agony (lit. suffering of mud and charcoal)\n民衆\tみんしゅう\tThe masses, populace\n怨嗟\tえんさ\tResentment, grudge\n湧く\tわく\tTo well up, surge, boil\n相繼ひ\tあいつぎ\tSuccessively, one after another (older form)\n奥地\tおくち\tInterior, hinterland\n重慶政權\tじゅうけいせいけん\tChongqing regime (referring to Chiang Kai-shek's government)\n天府の国\tてんぷのくに\tLand of heavenly abundance (epithet for Sichuan)\nインフレ\tインフレ\tInflation\n闇取引\tやみとりひき\tBlack market transaction, illicit trade\n配給\tはいきゅう\tRationing, distribution\n徴發\tちょうはつ\tRequisition, compulsory purchase (of grain)\n救ひ\tすくい\tSalvation, help, rescue (older form)\n皇軍\tこうぐん\tImperial Army (Japanese)\n日の丸\tひのまる\tFlag of Japan (lit. circle of the sun)\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n잡지명\t대동아 제15권 제3호\n발행일\t1943년 03월 01일\n기사제목\t崩壞すゐ敵の三首都(1), 飢へに泣く重慶\n기사형태\t논설\n\n崩壞すゐ敵の三首都\n일본문-원문\n연합국 수뇌부 캐리커쳐\n＜134-138＞","magazine":"大東亞 第15巻 第3号","date":"1943년 03월 01일 (March 1, 1943)","title":"Collapsing Enemy's Three Capitals (1): Chongqing Crying from Hunger"},{"path":"03/280.txt","issue":"03","content":"<136> Australia is a Nice Place\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis entry consists only of a page number and the article title, \"Australia is a Nice Place.\" There is no accompanying article text provided.

It frames the intense winter fishing efforts as a \"battle\" (漁獲戰), highlighting scenes from the fishing grounds to the drying racks (\"pollock mountain\") and a fishermen's training center (漁民道場), emphasizing the \"valiant scenery.\" From a historical perspective, the article is interesting as it clearly portrays colonial resource extraction (pollock fishing in Korea) explicitly linked to the Japanese war effort (\"fishing battle\"). The use of terms like \"battle\" and \"valiant\" serves as propaganda, glorifying labor mobilization in the colony for the empire's needs during the Pacific War.

For centuries, their joys, sorrows, aspirations, and critiques of the times have been encapsulated within its unique structure. To truly understand the heart of the Korean peninsula, one must engage with its *sijo*. However, the barrier of language has often prevented a deeper appreciation among speakers of the National Language (國語).\n\nThis series aims to bridge that gap. By translating representative Korean *sijo* into the National Language, we hope to reveal the \"true heart\" (まこと心) contained within these verses. This endeavor is not merely a linguistic exercise; it is an attempt to foster mutual understanding and appreciation between the mainland (内地) and the peninsula (半島), contributing to the great harmony of the Empire.\n\n<153>\nThe task of translation, especially of poetry, is fraught with challenges. The subtle nuances, the rhythm, the cultural backdrop – all these elements are difficult to convey perfectly in another tongue. The *sijo*, with its specific syllabic constraints and emotive depth, presents particular difficulties. Is it possible to capture the *makoto-gokoro* of a *sijo* in Japanese (國語)?\n\nWe believe it is possible, though perhaps not perfectly. The key lies in focusing not just on literal meaning, but on the underlying spirit and sentiment. A successful translation should evoke a similar emotional resonance in the reader of the National Language as the original does in a Korean reader. This requires not only linguistic skill but also a deep empathy for the culture from which the *sijo* emerged.\n\n<154>\nIn this first installment, we will examine several classic *sijo*, exploring their themes and attempting faithful, yet evocative, translations into the National Language. We shall begin with works that express universal human emotions – love, longing, reflections on nature, and the passage of time. By starting with these common themes, we hope to make the world of *sijo* more accessible.\n\nConsider, for example, the famous *sijo* attributed to Hwang Chini (黃眞伊). Its expression of longing is profound. Our translation aims to capture this depth. We invite the reader to compare the structure and feel, even without understanding the original Korean.\n\n<155>\nOf course, some *sijo* delve into specific historical contexts or philosophical ideas unique to Korea (朝鮮). Translating these requires even greater care and often necessitates explanatory notes. However, the essence, the *makoto-gokoro*, often transcends these specifics. It speaks to the shared humanity that binds us all within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere (大東亞共榮圈).\n\nFuture installments will delve into different types of *sijo*, including patriotic verses and those reflecting on societal changes. Through this ongoing work of translation and commentary, we aspire to contribute to a richer understanding of the diverse cultures within the Empire and the fundamental sincerity that can be found in the poetic traditions of the peninsula. This effort serves the ultimate goal of *naisen ittai* (内鮮一体), the true unity of Japan and Korea.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis article, the first in a series by Seo Du-su, introduces a project to translate Korean *sijo* poetry into Japanese (referred to as the \"National Language\"). The author argues that understanding *sijo* is key to understanding the \"true heart\" (makoto-gokoro) of the Korean people and that translation can foster mutual understanding between Japan (mainland) and Korea (peninsula). While acknowledging the difficulties of poetry translation, the author aims to convey the spirit and emotional resonance of *sijo*, starting with universal themes before moving to more culturally specific ones. The ultimate goal is framed within the context of imperial harmony, the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and achieving *naisen ittai* (Japan-Korea unity). For historians, the article is revealing in its explicit connection of literary translation to the Japanese colonial project's assimilationist goals (*naisen ittai*, *kokugo*) and its framing of Korean culture within the imperial structure (Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere). The attempt to define and translate the Korean \"soul\" or \"true heart\" into the colonizer's language is particularly noteworthy.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n朝鮮\tちょうせん\tChōsen (Korea)\n朝鮮民族\tちょうせんみんぞく\tChōsen minzoku (Korean people/ethnic group)\n内地\tないち\tNaichi (Mainland Japan)\n半島\tはんとう\tHantō (The Korean Peninsula)\n國語\tこくご\tKokugo (National Language, i.e., Japanese)\n黃眞伊\tこうしんい\tKō Shin'i (Hwang Chini - Korean kisaeng poet)\n大東亞共榮圈\tだいとうあきょうえいけん\tDai Tōa Kyōeiken (Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere)\n内鮮一体\tないせんいったい\tNaisen Ittai (Japan and Korea as one body/Unity of Japan and Korea)\n徐斗銖\tジョ・トシュ or ソ・ドゥス\tJo Tōshu / Seo Du-su (Author's name - reading uncertain, likely Korean author Seo Du-su)\n\n**Glossary**\n\n時調\tしちょう\tSijo (a traditional Korean poetic form)\nまこと心\tまことごころ\tTrue heart, sincerity, essence\n國語譯\tこくごやく\tNational Language translation (i.e., Japanese translation)\n朝鮮\tちょうせん\tKorea\n文藝評論\tぶんげいひょうろん\tLiterary criticism\n民族\tみんぞく\tPeople, ethnic group\n内地\tないち\tMainland (referring to Japan proper)\n半島\tはんとう\tPeninsula (referring to Korea)\n言語\tげんご\tLanguage\n翻譯\tほんやく\tTranslation\n詩歌\tしいか\tPoetry\n精神\tせいしん\tSpirit, mind, soul\n感情\tかんじょう\tEmotion, feeling\n共感\tきょうかん\tEmpathy, sympathy\n普遍的\tふへんてき\tUniversal\n主題\tしゅだい\tTheme, subject\n解説\tかいせつ\tExplanation, commentary\n多様\tたよう\tDiverse, various\n文化\tぶんか\tCulture\n帝國\tていこく\tEmpire\n究極\tきゅうきょく\tUltimate, eventual\n目標\tもくひょう\tGoal, objective\n一体\tいったい\tOne body, unity\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n잡지명\t대동아 제15권 제3호\n발행일\t1943년 03월 01일\n기사제목\t時調のまこと心, 朝鮮時調の國語譯(1)\n필자\t徐斗銖\n기사형태\t문예평론\n\n時調のまこと心, 朝鮮時調の國語譯\n\t\t\t\t\t\t徐斗銖\n일본문-원문\n＜152-155＞","magazine":"大東亞","date":"1943-03-01","title":"The True Heart of Sijo: Korean Translation of Korean Sijo (1)","author":"Seo Du-su"},{"path":"03/350.txt","issue":"03","content":"**Note:** The text content for the article \"獨逸の戰爭詩\" from pages 156-159 was not provided in the prompt.

Its publication in a magazine explicitly named \"Greater East Asia\" underscores its role in promoting the ideology of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and justifying Japanese militarism and sacrifice during the Pacific War.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n山形雄策\tやまがたゆうさく\tYamagata Yūsaku\n八木隆一郞\tやぎりゅういちろう\tYagi Ryūichirō\n今井正\tいまい ただし\tImai Tadashi\n\n**Glossary**\n\n望樓\tぼうろう\tWatchtower\n決死隊\tけっしたい\tSuicide squad; death-defying corps\n脚本\tきゃくほん\tScreenplay (Note: original text used Korean term 각본)\n演出\tえんしゅつ\tDirection; Director (Note: original text used Korean term 연출)\n大東亞\tだいとうあ\tGreater East Asia\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n잡지명\t대동아 제15권 제3호\n발행일\t1943년 03월 01일\n기사제목\t望樓の決死隊\n필자\t山形雄策, 八木隆一郞(각본), 今井正(연출)\n기사형태\t희곡·시나리오\n\n望樓の決死隊\n\t\t\t\t\t\t山形雄策, 八木隆一郞(각본), 今井正(연출)\n일본문-원문\n＜164-198＞","magazine":"大東亞 第十五卷 第三號","date":"1943-03-01","title":"Suicide Squad of the Watchtower","author":"Yamagata Yusaku, Yagi Ryuichiro (Screenplay), Imai Tadashi (Director)"},{"path":"03/400.txt","issue":"03","content":"<200>\nEditorial Postscript\n\nWe have finally entered the decisive stage of the war. The American and British declarations of war against Japan have been issued, and the current great war truly presents the aspect of a world war. Depending on the outcome of this world war, we stand at a crossroads where either a new world order will be constructed or the old order will be maintained. The emotion of the Imperial subjects (皇國臣民), who bear the glory of participating in the Holy War (聖戰) which is the cornerstone of the construction of the new world order, is profound.\n\nOur peninsula's twenty-five million people are also now cooperating with national policy and dedicating themselves in every field. Observing this situation, as we look back on more than a year of the Holy War, we cannot suppress the welling up of complete trust and conviction.\n\nEntering the second year of the Holy War, we must further solidify the home front, push forward with patriotic increased food production, and bring the Greater East Asia War (大東亞戰爭) to completion as quickly as possible. Here and now, we renew our determination, commit ourselves thoroughly to the decisive battle lifestyle, and pledge to offer our total strength in service (御奉公).\n\nThis magazine is also determined to bear a part of this responsibility, exert its utmost effort, promote the self-awareness of being Imperial subjects, and thoroughly instill the significance of completing the Holy War. We earnestly desire the cooperation of our esteemed readers. (K)\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis editorial postscript from March 1943 emphasizes that the war against the US and Britain has reached a critical \"decisive stage.\" It calls upon the \"twenty-five million people\" of the Korean peninsula, framed as loyal \"Imperial subjects\" (皇國臣民), to fully support Japan's \"Holy War\" (聖戰) for a \"New World Order.\" The piece stresses the need to strengthen the home front, particularly through increased food production, and expresses the magazine's commitment to reinforcing this wartime ideology and sense of duty among its readers. For historians, this text clearly illustrates the intensified propaganda and mobilization efforts directed at Koreans during the later stages of the Pacific War, portraying their required contributions not as colonial subjects but as integral members of the Japanese Empire fighting for a shared destiny. It highlights the rhetoric of total war, imperial subjecthood, and the specific demand for increased agricultural output.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n米英\tべいえい\tUS and Britain\n半島\tはんとう\tPeninsula (Referring to Korea)\n皇國\tこうこく\tImperial Nation (Referring to Japan)\n大東亞戰爭\tだいとうあせんそう\tGreater East Asia War\n\n**Glossary**\n\n決戰段階\tけっせん段階\tDecisive stage of war\n對日挑戰狀\tたいにちちょうせんじょう\tDeclaration of war against Japan\n今次大戰\tこんじたいせん\tThe current great war\n世界新秩序\tせかいしんちつじょ\tNew World Order\n舊秩序\tきゅうちつじょ\tOld Order\n岐路\tきろ\tCrossroads; turning point\n聖戰\tせいせん\tHoly War\n皇國臣民\tこうこくしんみん\tSubjects of the Imperial Nation (Japan)\n國策\tこくさく\tNational policy\n協應\tきょうおう\tCooperation; coordination\n挺身活動\tていしんかつどう\tDevoting oneself; dedicated activity\n銃後\tじゅうご\tHome front (literally 'behind the guns')\n食糧増産報國\tしょくりょうぞうさんほうこく\tPatriotic service through increased food production\n完遂\tかんすい\tCompletion; accomplishment\n決意\tけつい\tDetermination; resolve\n決戰生活\tけっせんせいかつ\tDecisive battle lifestyle (life geared towards the war effort)\n總力\tそうりょく\tTotal strength; all-out effort\n御奉公\tごほうこう\tService (to the Emperor/nation)\n一端\tいったん\tOne part; a share\n自覺\tじかく\tSelf-awareness; consciousness\n讀者諸賢\tどくしゃしょけん\tEsteemed readers\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n잡지명\t대동아 제15권 제3호\n발행일\t1943년 03월 01일\n기사제목\t編輯後記\n기사형태\t사고·편집후기\n\n編輯後記\n일본문-원문\n＜200＞","magazine":"大東亜 第15巻 第3号","date":"March 1, 1943","title":"Post-Editing Thoughts"}];
