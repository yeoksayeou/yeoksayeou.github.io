With All Favors Concentrated on One Person

It was a spring of a certain year when flowers bloomed and birds sang. Sukjong Daewang, while enjoying the flowers in the Secret Garden of Changgyeong Palace with several close retainers, held a banquet of a hundred flowers in the garden. Not only were all the princes and grandsons, including Dongpyeonggun Hang (son of Chongseongun Hyo, son of Injo’s son, Sungseongun), who was the most favored among the royal family at the time, and all the officials and bureaucrats present, but also all three thousand beauties of the harem attended without exception. The sounds of the phoenix flute and dragon pipe harmonized, playing songs of peace, and jade cups filled with golden dew celebrated the king's longevity. The king, with his spring spirit in full swing amidst the fragrance of flowers and the warmth of wine, looked around at the many court ladies and said with a joyful smile, "Today's banquet is a special flower-viewing banquet, so everyone, without exception, should say something about flowers. In particular, if there is anyone who can tell me 'what flower is like me' and pleases my heart, I will give a generous reward." Hearing this, the many court ladies competed to show themselves favorably to the king and receive a reward, speaking one after another. Of course, all kinds of flowers came up in their stories. Some said that the Holy Ruler bestows grace upon all people, so he is like the cotton rose (木棉花), which becomes the clothes of many people. Others said that he is noble as the Son of Heaven, so he is like the cinnamon tree in the moon (月中丹桂). Some said that his longevity is endless, so he is like the rose of Sharon (無窮花). Others said that his dignified manner is like the six flowers of the severe winter (snow) and his appreciation of elegance is like the red peach and green plum blossoms. All the court ladies came out and spoke in this way, but only one court lady at the end of the line did not come out and remained silent. The King found it strange and ordered the court lady to come closer to him. Looking at her, she was barely sixteen years old, but her beauty was unparalleled in the world. Her hair, as beautiful as clouds, reminded one of Gwana (貫那) of Goguryeo in the old days (a court lady during the time of King Jungcheon, whose face was beautiful and hair was nine feet long). Her seductive attitude was like the revival of the *Ssangbi (雙飛) of Goryeo.<8> Her lotus-like face, willow-like eyebrows, eyes as clear as autumn water, and teeth as beautiful as a string of shells would have moved even Wang Zhaojun or Yang Guifei of China to tears if they were reborn. The King was instantly captivated and thought to himself, "How could I not have known that there was such a beauty in my harem until now?" He personally asked her name, and she was Lady Jang (張宮人), the sister of military officer Jang Huijae (張希載). The King, with a face full of joy, asked Lady Jang again, "The other court ladies have all told stories about flowers, but you alone have not said anything. What is the reason for that?" Lady Jang lowered her head and slowly said in a clear voice, "Although Your Majesty has given the command to tell stories about flowers, I dare not compare the dignified Majesty to a flower and speak of it. I can only be filled with awe and remain silent." The King found it even more remarkable and said again, "Your words are very unique, but today I have already given my word, so do not hesitate and speak." Only then did Lady Jang answer, "Your Majesty is the king among men, and the peony (牧丹) is the king among flowers, so Your Majesty is like the peony if compared to a flower." The King found her words greatly remarkable and gave her a special reward. He ordered an old court lady to pick a branch of red peach blossoms and personally placed it on Lady Jang's head. All the court ladies thought it an honor, and from then on, Lady Jang's name filled the palace and beyond, and the favor of the three thousand beauties was truly concentrated on her alone.

The Birth of the Heir Apparent and Lady Jang's Promotion

At that time, Sukjong's age was nearly 30, but no child had been born to his first queen, Queen Ingyeong Kim (仁敬王后 金氏), and even after several years of marriage to his second queen, Queen Min (閔氏) (i.e., Queen Inhyeon), she had not produced any children. Sukjong, the only son of three generations since Hyojong, always felt the loneliness of his empty lap. Moreover, the aged Queen Dowager (大王大妃) (Injo's consort, Queen Dowager Joryeo (莊烈王后 趙氏)) and the Queen Mother (大妃) (Hyeonjong's consort, Queen Myeongseong Kim (明聖王后 金氏)) were greatly concerned about it. Queen Min, feeling uneasy, advised Sukjong to select a concubine again. However, Sukjong initially refused to listen because Queen Min was still in her prime. But Queen Min insisted, and the Queen Mother also showed signs of wanting it, so Sukjong could not stop it and issued an edict to select a concubine. Queen Min, knowing well that Lady Jang (張氏) of the palace was exceptionally beautiful and clever and also guessing that Sukjong loved her, recommended Lady Jang as a concubine. At that time, the Grand Queen Dowager and Princess Jeongmyeong (貞明翁主) (daughter of Seonjo, married to Hong Juchin (洪柱臣), the Lord of Yeongan, who was over 70 years old at the time) were concerned that Lady Jang's beauty was too great and her womanly virtue might be lacking, so they earnestly advised against it. But Queen Min did not listen, and eventually Lady Jang was chosen in the selection. This was Lady Jang's temporary good fortune, but also the cause of Queen Min's later deposition. From then on, Lady Jang's favor grew day by day, and in the twelfth year of Sukjong (丙寅), she was promoted to Suk-ui (淑儀) in one leap and given 100 slaves. Also, her relatives inside and outside the palace were given considerable official positions (because Lady Jang's mother was a needlewoman in Jo Saseok's (趙師錫) house, Jo was appointed Right State Councillor in Jeongmyo). Her power spread inside and outside the palace, and many people followed and flattered her. (At that time, Jeong-eon Han Seong-woo (韓聖佑) was dismissed after submitting a memorial opposing Lady Jang's appointment, and an edict was issued stating that anyone who spread rumors about Lady Jang's affairs would be publicly executed).
Then, on September 28 of the fourteenth year of Sukjong (戊辰), at the hour of the rooster, Prince Yun (昀) (i.e., Gyeongjong) was born. This was a great celebration for the royal family and a great honor for the Jang family. Because of this, Sukjong's favor for Lady Jang became even deeper, and of course, Lady Jang's power grew even greater. Lady Jang's father was allowed to enter and leave the palace freely by royal order. One day, Lady Jang's mother passed through Geonyang Gate in a palanquin carried by eight people. Jipyong Yi Ik-su (李益壽) (Seoin) was outraged by this and broke the palanquin, burned it, and beat the servants. Sukjong was greatly angered and ordered the Naesusaji (內需司) to execute two prison guards, causing a great uproar inside and outside the palace.

The Naming of the Heir Apparent and the Activities of the Namin

It is common for ordinary village women to run wild as they please if they have power. How much more so for Jang Huibin, a beautiful woman of ambition who had both talent, intelligence, and political strategy? When she was in the harem, she was extremely gentle and docile, but once she gained position and power, her ambition to climb higher and higher (登壟(?)望蜀) manifested. She was determined to sweep away the power of Queen Min's faction (閔后一派) and expand her own power. Furthermore, she had a deep-seated resentment against Seoin Yi Ik-su (李益壽), who had broken and burned her mother's palanquin and abused her servants. To avenge this, she realized that it was necessary to ally with the Namin (南人), the great enemies of the Seoin, who had been out of favor since the Gyeongsin Persecution (庚申大獄) and were always discontented. First, she sent flirtatious glances to Dongpyeonggun Hang (東平君杭), who had many connections with the Namin, and had her brother, Jang Huijae, mediate, staging a grand drama. The first act was the movement to name the heir apparent (元子定號運動), and the second act was the movement to depose the queen (廢妃運動). The clown in this drama was Sukjong Daewang. It was the 10th day of the first month of the year Gisa (己巳年). Sukjong, who was in charge of the program for this drama, summoned the ministers, the six departments, and the heads of the three offices to inquire about the matter of naming the prince as the heir apparent. He then said, "Even if there are great officials who have different intentions, they should immediately resign." This was undoubtedly a major bombshell against the Seoin's world, the current political situation, through the machinations of Lady Jang and the Namin faction. If this movement succeeded, the power of the Namin would expand, and at the same time, the Seoin would receive revenge for the Gyeongsin Persecution, and Queen Min's position, which was backed by the Seoin, would also be threatened. Foreseeing this, the Seoin had no choice but to oppose the naming of the heir apparent in order to maintain their own power. Thus, starting with Chief State Councillor Kim Su-heung (金壽興), Minister of Personnel Nam Yong-ik (南龍翼), Minister of Taxation Yu Sang-un (柳尙運), Minister of War Yun Ji-wan (尹趾完), Minister of Works Shim Jae (沈梓), and Chief Censor Choi Gyu-seo (崔奎瑞), the great leaders of the Seoin all opposed in unison despite Sukjong's strict order, but ultimately achieved no effect. On the 14th of the same month, according to the report of the Ministry of Rites, he issued a decree to name the prince as the heir apparent, and on the 16th of the same month, he formally appointed the prince as the heir apparent and also appointed Lady Jang as Huibin (禧嬪).
However, the Seoin faction at the time harbored resentment, and in February of that year, Bongjoheo Song Si-yeol (宋時烈) submitted another memorial stating that the establishment of the heir apparent was premature. At that time, it had already been about a month since the prince was appointed as the heir apparent.<10> Sukjong said, "Since the heir apparent has been established, the roles of ruler and subject have already been determined. However, those who still submit such memorials must have dissatisfaction with the heir apparent and cannot be forgiven." He then went to the Heejong Hall and again inquired of the officials about Si-yeol's intentions. The Namin faction's Second Deputy Minister Yi Hyeon-gi (李玄紀), Scholar Nam Chi-hun (南致薰), and Second Deputy Minister Yun Bin (尹彬) pointed out the errors in his memorial and also impeached the fact that Si-yeol had previously split with Yun Jeung (尹拯) over a personal matter, causing controversy in the court. Sukjong was even more angered and immediately exiled Song Si-yeol to Jeju, dismissed Chief State Councillor Kim Su-heung from his post, and exiled Yi Sa-myeong, Yi Ik, Kim Ik-hun, Yi Sun-myeong, and Kim Man-jung. He specially appointed Mok Rae-seon (睦來善) and Kim Deok-won (金德遠) as Left and Right State Councillors, appointed Mok Chang-myeong (睦昌明) and Gwon Yu (權愈) as Secretaries, exonerated those who had died in the Gyeongsin Persecution, and confiscated the official titles of Kim Man-gi (金萬基) of Gwangseong and Kim Seok-ju (金錫冑) of Cheongseong, who were so-called meritorious subjects of Boseong at the time. As a result, a major change occurred in the political situation, and the Namin, who had harbored resentment for many years, seized power again, and the Seoin suffered a tragic fate of being swept away all at once.

Deposition of Queen Min and the Glory of the Jang Family

Those who felt great fear about the enthronement of Lady Jang's son as heir apparent and the sweeping away of the Seoin's power were Queen Min. Queen Min was originally the second daughter of Minister of War Min Yu-jung (閔維重), the great leader of the Seoin, and the granddaughter of Song Jun-gil (宋浚吉) of Dongchun. Due to her relationship with Kim Seok-ju (金錫冑) of Cheongseong, who arranged the marriage, she was in a position to share her fate with the Seoin. Initially, she had recommended Lady Jang as a concubine herself, but as the saying goes, "Women have no beauty or ugliness, but they are jealous when they enter the palace." As Lady Jang gradually gained power, even Queen Min, who possessed the virtues of seclusion and integrity, naturally felt jealousy. When Lady Jang was appointed as Suk-ui in the Byeongin year, she claimed to have had a dream and told Sukjong, "In my dream, the late king and queen personally said that the Inner Palace and Consort Kim have extended blessings and many descendants like during the reign of King Seonjo. However, Suk-ui will not only be childless but also lack fortune. If she stays in the palace for a long time, she will surely collude with the remnants of the Gyeongsin Persecution (the Namin) and bring great disaster to the nation." And when the prince was born, she had prepared a girl's hat in advance. Upon seeing that a boy was born, she said, "I thought a girl would be born, but unexpectedly, a boy was born." And once, she told the King, "Suk-won (淑媛) is originally a demon from a previous life who was shot and killed by Your Majesty. She was born to seek revenge and will surely harm Your Majesty." She also said, "Lady Jang originally has no children in her destiny and is only pretending to be affectionate to the heir apparent." Every time such words were spoken, Sukjong considered not driving Queen Min away. One day, when Sukjong entered Huibin's palace, a dog being raised in a palace maid's house was found lying in the yard, vomiting blood. The King found it strange and asked Lady Jang about it. Lady Jang said nothing and sat quietly, then shed tears and said, "Your Majesty cherishes the remnants of my life and wishes to send me out of the palace as soon as possible to live a free life." Sukjong was even more suspicious and asked in detail. Lady Jang replied, "Today, Her Majesty the Queen sent food, but the color of the food seemed so strange that I did not eat it and gave it to the dog as a test. It died as you see." She then said, "Fortunately, today, thanks to divine grace, it was discovered and I did not die. But if such a thing happens again in the future, I will die without even knowing it. Is that not dangerous and pitiful?" Sukjong felt compassion for Lady Jang and at the same time thought of Queen Min as a person of eternal sin. (It is said that this incident was mostly Lady Jang's attempt to harm Queen Min, but considering the above-mentioned facts about Queen Min, it is also questionable.) Then, on April 23 of the year Gisa (己巳年), on Queen Min's birthday, birthday food was to be offered to the Great Hall and Lady Jang from the Min Palace. Lady Jang, who had been frightened by the poisoning incident the other day, was like a startled bird and feared that such a thing might happen again. She told the King to pay attention to the food offering and also said many things that were unfavorable to Queen Min. The King believed her words and ordered that the offering list and the congratulatory list of the officials be returned in full. He also ordered that the offered food be buried in the back garden and imprisoned the messenger Ju Bin (朱彬) in the inner prison. He then summoned the ministers and officials of the second rank and announced the deposition of the Queen. He also revealed the Queen's sins and issued a memorandum of deposition. Left Secretary Yi Si-man (李蓍晩), Scholar Yi Won-man (李萬元), and Minister Yi Sang-jin (李尙眞) strongly protested, but were dismissed or exiled. More than 80 people, including Professors Park So-bo (朴素輔), Minister Oh Du-in (吳斗寅), and Deputy Minister Yi Se-hwa (李世華), submitted memorials, but their intentions were displeasing. The leaders of the memorials, Park Tae-bo (朴泰輔), Yi Se-hwa, and Oh Du-in, were subjected to severe torture and exiled to remote areas. Park and Oh died from the torture on the way. Song Si-yeol, Kim Su-heung, and Yi Sa-myeong, who had been exiled for opposing the appointment of the heir apparent the other day, were given death sentences. Those among Queen Min's relatives who held official positions were all dismissed. On May 4, Queen Min was confined to her ancestral home in Anguk-dong (i.e., Gamgodang) and even the offering of rice and water to the Inner Palace was stopped. At the same time, Lady Jang was promoted and appointed as Queen, her father Jang Gyeong (張烱) was appointed Lord of Oksan (玉山府院君), and her mother, Lady Yun and Lady Go, were each appointed Lady of the Prefecture. Her brother Jang Huijae (張希載) was appointed Commander of the Training Command. At that time, political power was almost entirely in the hands of the Jang family. This coup was the most bloody coup in the modern political history of Joseon.

Jang Huibin and Choe Sukbin

Jang Huibin, as a humble concubine of the palace, occupied the noble position of Queen in one morning and enjoyed the wealth and glory of the clan. It was only natural that her arrogance and tyranny would increase day by day. Internally, in order to fundamentally eliminate the power of Queen Min's faction, she drove out even the palace maids and soldiers who were close to Queen Min. In extreme cases, she sent assassins to assassinate Queen Min in confinement. Externally, she strengthened her alliance with the Namin, preventing the Seoin from daring to covet political power. She also kept a close watch on Sukjong, fearing that he might favor other concubines. Sukjong gradually began to dislike Jang, and also regretted deposing the queen. One night, Sukjong, who was accustomed to patrolling at night, was strolling in the palace following the moonlight when he passed near the room of a certain court lady. Although it was already late at night, the lamps were still shining brightly. Sukjong found it strange and peeked through the window. A court lady was offering sacrifices to a memorial tablet for the deposed queen on the wall with a table full of delicacies. Sukjong summoned the court lady and asked her the reason. The court lady was terrified and replied, "This humble servant has received great favor from the Min Palace. Now, the Queen is confined and spending her days in coarse clothes and poor food. Today is especially the Queen's birthday. If it were like before, all the officials would be offering congratulations and supplying delicacies from the mountains and the sea, but now she is in such a tragic situation that she is even worried about the daily offerings. Although I am a humble servant, I could not bear to remain still on this day, so I dared to prepare some of the Queen's favorite foods and express my sincerity. Unexpectedly, it has touched the heavenly eyes. Ten thousand deaths would not be enough to atone for my sin." Sukjong, who would have immediately executed the court lady at the time of the deposition of the Queen, but who gradually regretted the deposition, was even more moved. While thinking of Queen Min, he especially favored the court lady. Unexpectedly, the court lady became pregnant. At that time, Jang, seeing that Sukjong's attitude was gradually changing, became even more vigilant in monitoring Sukjong's actions. Upon hearing that the court lady had been favored by Sukjong and had even become pregnant, her jealousy as a toxic woman erupted. She seized the court lady, burned her with fire, beat her with clubs, inflicted all kinds of torture, and then confined her in a locked room. Sukjong, who was completely unaware of the facts, happened to enter Jang's palace. An unfamiliar dog was in the courtyard, various torture implements were scattered everywhere, and Jang's face was full of malice, looking as if she had committed a great crime. Sukjong was greatly suspicious and ordered a palace slave to remove the dog from the courtyard. Unexpectedly, a woman with a full stomach, covered in blood and with disheveled hair, was groaning. Sukjong examined her closely and found that she was the court lady whom he had previously favored. He quickly ordered another court lady to rescue her and place her in a separate room. Coincidentally, that night, the court lady gave birth to a jade child (甲戌 September 13), who would become the great ruler of the late Joseon Dynasty, King Yeongjo. The court lady was Choe Sukbin (淑嬪 崔氏).

Kim Chuntak's Conspiracy and the Restoration of Queen Min

The Seoin, who had been defeated after Gisa, were barely able to preserve their remaining strength, but they did not neglect their efforts to recover their power. The vanguard of this movement was the talented and cunning Bukheon Kim Chuntak (北軒 金春澤). He first manipulated literature and created a novel called "Changseon Gamuirok (倡善感義錄)" to circulate in the palace, moving Sukjong's heart. Among the people, he spread the "Jangdari" folk song ("Melodies are for all seasons, Jangdari is only for one season," etc., meaning that melodies are Queen Min, Jangdari is Lady Jang, meaning that Queen Min will always be well, and Lady Jang is only temporary), gathering popular sentiment. He also collected money with Han Jung-hyeok (韓重爀) and Kang Man-tae (康晩泰) and bought a palace maid's sister with a thousand gold coins to make her his concubine. He bribed Jang Huijae's wives and concubines (Huijae's wife "Jageunagi (자근아긔)" even committed adultery, and his concubine Sukjeong (淑正) (Sukjeong was originally a female slave of Dongpyeonggun who Dongpyeong gave to Huijae) also secretly colluded) to investigate the secrets of the palace and the Jang family. Then, on April 2 of the 20th year of Sukjong (甲戌), Chuntak's conspiracy of "gathering silver and engaging in relationships, restoring the queen and changing the situation" was heard. Right State Councillor Min Am (閔黯) reported the change to Ham I-wan (咸以完) and, with the King's permission, imprisoned dozens of people, including Kim Chuntak, Han Jung-hyeok, Yi Si-hwi (李時檜), and Choe Gyeok (崔格), in the Forbidden Office and had the head of the Uigeumbu (義禁府) Yu Myeong-hyeon (柳命賢) and Training Commander Yi Eui-jeung (李義徵) punish them, even completing the process of obtaining confessions. However, because it was already sunset, the execution was not carried out and was postponed to the next day.<13> However, Sukjong, whose changes were as unpredictable as clouds and rain, suddenly changed his attitude at the second watch of the night, stripping all the officials below the ministers who had been punishing Chuntak of their official titles and sending them out of the palace. He ordered Min Am and the high officials of the Forbidden Office to be placed on remote islands. At the same time, he stripped Training Commander Yi Eui-jeung of his military seal and replaced him with Shin Yeo-cheol (申汝哲). He appointed Yun Ji-wan as Royal Commander, appointed other officials from the Seoin, and exonerated those who had been banished and stripped of their titles during the Gisa Deposition. This was a bolt from the blue for the Namin and Jang. This rapid political change was, of course, largely due to Sukjong's long-standing resentment towards the Namin and Jang's tyranny, but the internal situation was that Chuntak had bribed palace maids to slander the Namin faction and Jang. When Chuntak's affair was discovered, it exploded rapidly. Whether this was the good fortune of the Seoin and Queen Min or the misfortune of the Namin and Jang, it is unknown. However, causing a political change through bribery and adultery is the most scandalous thing, and there is no drama more intense than that.
Enough of the idle talk - the Seoin faction, which had caused this rapid political change, first began the movement to restore Queen Min. Sukjong also regretted his past mistakes and, on the 9th, issued a decree to move Queen Min from her private residence to Oigong. On the 12th, he had her re-enter the palace, restored the titles of her parents-in-law, and restored Queen Min at the same time. He took away the seal of Queen Jang and demoted her to her previous title of Huibin. He confiscated the decree of appointment for her parents and burned them. He destroyed the jade seal of the deposed queen and buried it in the ground. From now on, he established a strict prohibition against appointing a concubine as queen in the nation. Jang's younger brother, Huijae, was accused of plotting to harm the former queen when she was confined to her private residence (the so-called Eonseo Incident) and was sentenced to death. However, because the crown prince was only 7 years old at the time and the matter involved Huibin, the death penalty was commuted to exile to Jeju due to the appeals of heavy officials such as Nam Gu-man (南九萬). The power of the Jang family, which had boasted of wealth and glory for a time, vanished like a spring dream.

The So-Called Witchcraft Incident and Jang's Last Moments

Whether Jang had done wrong or not, her son had already become the crown prince of the nation, and she had also become the queen of the nation. Not only was she deposed and stripped of her titles in one morning, but her parents were also stripped of their titles, and her beloved brother Huijae was even exiled to a remote place. How could her grievances be compared to those of an ordinary court lady who had been temporarily favored and then lost favor? Moreover, the fact that her political enemy, Queen Min, had taken possession of her son and would not even allow her, the biological mother, to see him was the most painful resentment. (After Jang's deposition, she was not allowed to see the crown prince.) Thus, although she was confined to a corner of the deep palace, she was determined to cause another political change. Externally, she sent flirtatious glances to the remnants of the deposed Namin, planning to come back again. Internally, she used curses (俗稱예방), a great superstition in Joseon and a traditional evil practice in the Lee Dynasty palace, to harm Queen Min. She also buried wooden dolls with the crown prince's birthdate written on them in Jang's ancestral tomb in order to harm the Seoin (the so-called Burying Misfortune Incident of the Byeongja year). Time passed, and it became the 27th year of Sukjong, Sinsa (辛巳). Queen Min, who had been suffering from phlegm and tumors since the previous year, Gyeongjin,<14> did not respond to any medicine and passed away on August 14 of the same year at the age of 35. Sukjong felt sorry for her premature death without any offspring and for her suffering during her confinement, and was always saddened. Sukjong, who was famous for having good dreams (Sukjong often spoke about dreams even during political affairs), dreamed one night, whether it was due to thinking about it day and night, that a eunuch who had died the other day came to pay his respects and said, "There are many evil things in the palace. The Queen has suffered misfortune, and there will be unfavorable things for Your Highness and the Crown Prince." He pointed to Jiseondang (就善堂) (Jang's palace) and left. Then, Queen Min appeared covered in blood and said, "My death was not my fate, but due to Jang's curses." Then she suddenly disappeared. Sukjong was greatly shocked and immediately went to Jang's residence in disguise. It was already the third watch, but Jang, with all her maids and Huijae's concubine Sukjeong, was gathering all the tools used for the curse and washing them. This was, of course, Jang's attempt to get rid of the curses she had used to curse Queen Min after her death. Sukjong suddenly opened the door and questioned them. They were all terrified and tried to explain it as prayers for the Crown Prince's smallpox or prayers for the Queen's recovery. Because their words were different, Sukjong was even more amazed by the dream and greatly angered by Jang's actions. He pointed at Jang and called her a traitor who was trying to kill the queen mother. On September 24, he issued a decree listing Jang's past and present crimes and ordered her to commit suicide immediately. Jang Huijae, who had been exiled to Jeju, was also sentenced to death, as well as palace maids Chuksaeng (丑生), Seolhyang (雪香), Siyeong (時英), Sugyeong (淑英), Cheolsaeng (鐵生), Jeongi (貞伊), Illyeol (一烈), and Huijae's wives and concubines, and dozens of others related to this incident. This was the Sin-sa Witchcraft Incident.
However, a great tragedy was also enacted when Jang was about to die. Jang initially explained her innocence to the utmost, but Sukjong did not listen at all. Knowing that she could not avoid it, Jang finally wished to see her son Gyeongjong once. Sukjong did not refuse and allowed them to meet for a final farewell. Jang embraced her son and cried bitterly. Finally, she revealed her true colors as a toxic woman and said, "Now that I am going to die, how can I let my son serve the Min and Yi families?" She rushed forward and grabbed Gyeongjong's testicles. Gyeongjong fainted on the spot and lost consciousness for several hours, but was fortunately saved (Gyeongjong was only 14 years old at the time, and Gyeongjong's lifelong illness and childlessness were due to this). Jang died pitifully with a cup of poison. Alas, the misfortune of a beautiful woman is indeed misfortune, but how can human ruthlessness reach this extreme? Emperor Wu of Han (漢武帝) made Emperor Zhao (召帝) his crown prince, but there was no precedent for killing his mother, Lady Gouyi (鉤弋夫人). Such a cruel event is rare in history. After hundreds of years of spring breeze and autumn rain, the Gisa year, when Jang was appointed queen, has returned. When flowers bloom in Changgyeong Garden and azaleas weep sadly in the pine forests of Injang-ri (Jang's tomb), who would not shed tears when thinking of the unfortunate death of Jang, who was a heroine and beauty of her time?<15>

張禧嬪哀史-肅宗朝宮中秘話
						壽春學人
三千寵愛在一身

꽃이 피고 새가 노래하는 어느 해 봄이엿다. 肅宗大王은 여러 近臣들과 가티 昌慶宮 秘苑에서 꼿구경을 하다가 니여서 苑中에 百花宴을 열엇섯다. 當時 王族中 가장 寵愛를 밧는 東平君 杭(仁祖의 子 崇善君 澂의 子)을 비롯하야 여러 公子王孫이며 諸臣百官이 다 뫼힌 것은 勿論이고 後宮의 三千粉黛도 한사람빠지지 안코 보도 참예하얏다. 鳳笙龍管은 태평의 歌曲을 和奏하고 玉盃金露는 聖壽萬歲를 頌祝하얏다. 花香酒醺에 春興이 方酣한 大王은 여러 宮女들을 도라보며 欣然이 웃서갈로되 오눌의 宴會는 특별이 꼿구경을 하는 연회이니 너희들은 누구나 할 것 업시 꼿이약이를 한마듸씩 하되 特히 『나와 가튼 꼿이 무슨 꼿인 것』을 가르처 말하야 내 마음에 맛게 하는 사람이 잇으면 厚賞을 주리라 하얏다. 이 말을 들은 여러 宮女들은 제 各히 王께 곱게 뵈고 賞을 타랴고 한아식 둘식 압흘 닷투워서 꼿이야기를 하얏다. 그 이약이 중에 물론 별의별 꼿이 다 나왔다. 聖主는 萬民에 恩澤을 입히시니 여러 萬民의 옷이 되는 주라꼿(木棉花)과 갓다는 사람도 잇고, 貴爲天子하시니 月中丹桂라는 사람도 잇고, 聖壽無窮하시니 無窮花갓다는 사람도 잇고, 威儀甚嚴하심은 嚴冬의 六花(雪)와 갓고 風流조와하심은 紅桃碧花갓다는 사람도 잇섯다. 이와 가티 여러 宮女가 다 나오서 이약이를 하되 오직 末席에 잇는 宮女 한사람은 나오지 안코 그저 침목하고 잇슬 따름이엿다. 上이 怪異히 녁여 그 궁녀를 御前으로 각가이 오라 하고 한번 살펴보니 그는 방년이 겨우 二八이 될낙말낙한데, 姿色이 天下에 絶特하야 구름가티 고흔머리는 녯날 高句麗의 貫那(中川王時 宮女니 顔色이 佳麗하고 髮長 9尺이엿다)를 연상하게 되고 妖艶한 태도는 高麗의 *雙飛가<8> 復活한 듯하며 芙蓉가튼 얼골과 버들가튼 눈섭이며 秋水가티 맑은 눈 編貝가티 고흔 니는 支那의 王昭君이나 楊貴妃가 再生하야도 눈물을 겨을만하엿다. 大王은 한번보매 精神이 怳惚하야 혼자 생각하기를 우리 後宮에 저러한 美人이 잇는 것을 엇지하야 입때까지 몰낫나하고 親히 姓名을 물으니 그는 軍官 張希載의누이 張宮人이엿다. 上은 滿面喜色으로 다시 張氏에게 물어 갈오되 여러 궁녀들이 다 꼿이약이를 하되 惟獨 너는 아모 이약이도 안이하니 그것이 무슨 까닭이냐고 하얏다. 張氏는 머리를 나즉히 하고 琅琅한 목소리로 천천이 아리우되 아모리 大殿께서 꼿이약이를 하라신 御命이 이 게시오나 존엄하신 大殿을 敢히 꼿으로 比하야 말슴을 올일 수 업사와 그저 惶恐無言할 따름이엿나이다 하니 上이 더욱 奇特히 녁여 다시 말하되 너의 말이 매우 奇特은 하나 오눌운 내가 이미 許諾을 한 터이니 조금도 어렵게 생각지 말고 말을 하라고 하얏다. 張氏는 그제야 아리오되 『大殿은 사람 中에 王이시고 牧丹은 꼿중에 王이온즉 大殿은 꼿으로 치면 牧丹과 갓슴니다』 라고 하엿다. 대왕은 그 말을 크게 奇特이 녁여 特히 厚賞을 주고 늙은 女官을 命하야 紅桃花 한가지를 꺽거다가 親히 張氏의 머리우에 꼬저 주니 일반 宮女들이 모도 榮光스럽게 생각하고 그로부터 張氏의 이름이 宮內宮外에 가득하며 三千의 寵愛는 實로 그의 한 몸에 集中하얏섯다.

元子誕生과 張氏 陞爵

때에 肅宗의 春秋는 正히 30에 近하얏스나 先后 仁敬王后 金氏의 몸에도 아모 所生이 업고 繼后 閔氏(卽 仁顯王后)도 嘉禮를 한지 여러 해가 되어도 또한 子女間 生産을 못하니 孝宗이래 三代의獨子인 肅宗은 그 膝下의 寂寞한 것을 항상 늣기는 中 더욱히 年老한 大王大妃(仁祖妃 莊烈王后 趙氏)와 大妃(顯宗妃 明聖王后 金氏)가 주소로 크게 걱정을 하니 閔后는 於心에 불안하야 肅宗에세 후궁을 다시 간택할 일을 勸하얏다. 그러나 肅宗은 閔后가 아죽까지 年齡이 方强함으로 츠음에는 聽從치 안이하더니 閔后가 極力으로 勸할 뿐 안이라 大妃가 또한 希望하는 氣色이 잇스매 肅宗도 또한 强止치 못하고 이여 後宮간택할 傳敎를 나리니 閔后는 本來에 宮人 張氏의 姿色이 絶特하고 性質이 冷悧한 것을 잘 아는 外에 肅宗이 平素에 또한 그를 사랑하는 것을 짐작하고 張氏를 後宮으로 薦하얏다. 그때에 王大妃와 貞明翁主(宣祖의 女로 永安尉 洪柱臣에게 出嫁하얏스니 時 70餘다)는 張氏의 姿色이 너무 美麗하고 婦德이 적을 것을 忌嫌하야 간절이 勸止하얏스나 閔氏가 듯지 안음으로 結局 張氏가 간택에 뽑히게 되니 이는 張氏의 一時 幸運인 동시에 後日 閔氏가 被黜될 張本이엿다. 이로부터 張氏의 恩寵은 날로 두터워저서 肅宗 12년 丙寅에는 一躍하야 淑儀로 封爵되고 奴婢 100口를 劃給하며 또 內外親戚이 상당한 官職을 하게 되니 (張氏母가 趙師錫집 針母엿던 까닭에 丁卯에는 趙氏가 右相이 되엿다) 그의 勢力이 內外에 뜰치여서 追隨附勢하는 무리가 또한 적지 안엇섯다. (時에 正言韓聖佑가 張氏 封爵을 反對上疏하다가<9> 遞職되고 因하야 張氏의 事로 興言造謗하는 者는 直爲梟示하기로 下敎하엿다)
그러다가 肅宗 14년 戊辰 9월 28일 酉時에 王子 昀(卽 景宗)을 誕生하니 이는 王家의 一大慶事인 동시에 張門의 一大光榮이엿다. 그로 因하야 張氏에 대한 肅宗의 寵愛가 더욱 김허지고 따러서 張氏의 勢力이 더 커질 것은 勿論이다. 張氏의 私親은 御命으로 宮中出入을 無常으로 하엿는데 一日은 張氏의 親母가 8人의 屋轎를 타고 建陽門 안으로 통과하엿더니 持平 李益壽(西人)가 그것을 憤慨하야 그 屋轎를 따려부시여서 불에 태우고 그 下人을 잡아다 鞭打하니 肅宗이 크게 怒하야 內需司에 命하야 禁吏 2인을 刑殺하니 內外의 興論이 자못 沸騰하얏다.

元子定號와 南人의 活躍

尋常한 村婦라도 自己勢力만 잇스면 마음대로 날뛰는 것이 常例이거던 하물려 才氣智謀政略을 兼有하나 出世의 美人 張禧嬪이랴 그는 後宮에 잇슬때에는 極히 柔順溫和하얏스나 及其也地位勢力을 엇고 보니 登壟(?)望蜀의 野心이 발발하야 閔后一派의 勢力을 一蹴하고 自己勢力을 擴張하기에 苦心하얏다. 더구나 向者에 西人 李益壽가 自己母親의 屋轎를 打破焚碎하고 下人까지 亂打侮辱한 것은 平生에 切齒腐心하는 恨事로 그것을 報復함에는 무엇보다도 往年 庚申大獄以後로 落坧不遇하야 항상 不平不滿을 가지고 잇는 西人의 大仇敵인 在野黨 南人을 結托하는 것이 필요한 것을 看破하고 먼저 南人과 結緣이 만흔 東平君杭에게 秋波를 보내고 자기의 올아비되는 張希載로 中間에 알선케 하야 一大活劇을 演出하엿스니 其第 一幕이 즉 元子定號운동이오. 第二幕이 廢妃운동이엿다. 이 演劇에 어리광대는 肅宗大王이엿다. 己巳年 正月 初 10일이다. 이 演劇의 푸르그람을 맛튼 肅宗은 大臣, 六卿, 三司長官을 引見하고 王子의 元子定號할 事는 下詢하고 因하야 語하야 曰 비록 大官衆臣中이라도 敢히 異圖가 잇는 사람이 잇스면 卽時 納官退去함이 可하다고 하나 이는 勿論 張氏와 南人派의 策動으로서 西人의 天下인 當時政局에 대한 一大爆烈彈이엿다. 이 운동이 성공되면 南人의 勢力이 擴大되고 따러서 西人이 庚申大獄의 報復을 밧는 同時에 西人을 背景으로 한 閔妃의 地位가 또한 위태할 것은 明若觀火한 일이엿다. 이것을 미리 짐작한 西人은 元子定號를 反對하는 것보다도 自己勢力을 保持하기 爲하야 反對치 안이치 못하게 되엿다. 그리하야 領相金壽興을 爲始하야 吏判南龍翼, 戶判柳尙運, 兵判尹趾完, 工判沈梓, 大諫崔奎瑞 등 西人의 巨首들은 肅宗의 이 嚴命이 잇슴에 不拘하고 齊聲反對하얏스나 結局 아모 效果도 엇지 못하고 同月 14일에는 禮曹의 啓에 依하야 王子를 元子로 定號할 事를 傳敎하고 同 16일에는 正式으로 王子를 元子로 封하고 또 張氏는 禧嬪으로 封하얏다.
그러나 當時 西人一派는 一向 不滿을 가지고 그 해 2월에는 奉朝賀 宋時烈이 또 建儲尙早의 疏를 上하니 때는 벌서 王子를 元子로<10> 封한 후 略 1個月이나 된지라 肅宗은 갈오되 元子를 한 이상에는 이미 君臣의 分義가 定한 터인데 그래도 不拘하고 이러한 上疏를 하는 것은 필경 世子에 대한 不滿을 가진 것인즉 그대로 용서할 수 업다하고 이에 熙政殿에 御하야 다시 諸臣에게 時烈의 疏意를 下詢하니 南人派의 右副承旨 李玄紀, 校理 南致薰, 同副承旨 尹彬 등이 이 其疏章中의  잘못한 點을 指摘하고 且 前日에 時烈이 一個私事로 尹拯과 分裂하야 朝野에 爭論이 生케한 事를 劾論하니 肅宗이 더욱 怒하야 卽時에 宋時烈을 濟州로 遠竄하고 領相 金壽興은 職을 罷하며 其外 李師命, 李翊, 金益勳, 李順命, 金萬重 等은 遠竄하고 睦來善, 金德遠을 特拜하야 左右相으로 삼고 睦昌明, 權愈 等으로 承旨를 除授하고 庚申에 獄死하 者를 仲冤하며 當時 所謂 保社功臣이던 光城金萬基, 淸城 金錫冑 등의 官爵을 追奪하니 이에 政局은 一大變動이 생겨서 積年 抑寃의 恨을 품듯 南人이 다시 政權을 잡고 西人은 一時一網打盡의 悲運을 當하얏다.

閔妃廢立과 張門의 榮華

이와가티 張氏의 所生인 王子가 元子로 冊封되고 西人의 勢力이 一掃됨에 대하야 一大恐怖를 늣기는 이는 閔妃엿다. 閔妃는 원래 西人의 巨首인 兵判 閔維重의 第二女요. 同春 宋浚吉의 外孫女로 靑城 金錫冑가 仲媒하야 封侯된 關係상 西人과는 運命을 가티할 지위에 잇섯다. 츠음에는 張氏를 自己가 後宮으로 薦하얏스나 眞所謂女無美醜하고 入宮則妬라고 張氏가 점차 勢力을 엇게 됨에 미처서는 아모리 幽閒貞正의 德이 잇는 閔妃라도 自然이 嫉妬의 마음이 생길 것은 勿論이다. 丙寅年에 張氏가 淑儀로 封爵될때에는 夢事를 托하야 肅宗에게 言하야 갈오되 夢中에 『先王과 先后가 親히 말하기를 內殿과 貴人(金貴人)은 福祿이 延長하고 또 자손의 福이 宣朝와 가티 만흐나 淑儀는 無子할 뿐아니라 또한 복이 업서서 만일 宮中에 오래 잇스면 반듯시 庚申獄死者의 餘黨(指南人)과 結托하야 國家에 大禍를 밋츠리라』 云云하얏다 하고 또 王子가 誕生할때에는 미리 女帽를 지여 두엇다가 男子가 난 것을 보고는 나는 女子가 날 줄 알엇더니 意外에 男子가 낫다고 하며 또 한번은 上께 말하되 淑媛은 本來 前生의 妖獸로서 主上에게 射殺한 바되야 그 報復으로 태여낫스니 반듯시 主上을 害할 것이라 하고 又日 張氏는 元來 八字에 子息이 업는 것인즉 元子에게 虛勢만 한다 하엿다 이러한 말이 날때마다 肅宗은 閔妃를 좃치 안케 생각하던 次 하루는 肅宗이 禧嬪의 宮으로 드러간 즉 內人의 집에서 기르던 개(犬)한마리가 뜰에서 피를 吐하고 잡바젓는지라 上이 怪異히 녁이여 張氏에게 물은 즉 張氏는 아모 말도 안이하고 잠잠이 안젓다가 泫然이 눈물을 흘이며 갈오되 主上께서 臣妾의 殘命을 사랑하시와 一日이라도 早速히 宮外로 내보서 自由生活을 하게 하야 달나하니 肅宗은 더욱 疑心하고 자서이 물은 즉 張氏는 대답하되 本日에 中宮殿下께서 飮食을 보내시엿는데 음식의 빗이 너무도 이상한 것 갓터서 먹지를 안코 시험으로 개를 주엇더니 저와가티 죽엇다하고 因하야 갈오되 오눌은 多幸이<11> 天恩으로 그것이 發覺되야 죽지를 안엇거니와 만일에 뒤에 또 그러한 일이 잇다면 臣妾은 죽는 줄도 모르고 죽을 터이니 그 안이 危險하고도 미憐치 안으냐하니 上이 張氏를 惻隱이 생각하는 同時에 閔氏는 千古罪惡의 人으로 생각하얏다.(이 事件은 대개 張氏가 閔妃를 陰害코자 한 일이라 하나 上述한 閔妃의 諸事實을 보면 其亦疑問이다) 그러다가 己巳年 4월 23일 卽 閔妃의 誕日을 當하야 閔宮에서 誕宴음식을 大殿과 張氏에게 供上하게 되며 前日 毒藥事件에 놀내인 張氏는 驚弓之鳥와 가터 또한 그러한 일이 잇슬가 두려워하야 上께 그 飮食進御에 主意할 事를 말하고 또 閔妃에 不利한 말을 만히 하니 王이 그 말ㅇ르 信聽하고 그날의 供上單子와 百官賀單을 全部還給하기를 命하고 또 進上한 飮食ㅇ은 後苑에 埋藏케 한 후 捧入承傳朱彬을 內獄에 拘囚하고 因하야 大臣과 從二品理想을 불너서 后의 廢出할 事를 宣言하고 또 后의 罪惡을 드러서 廢出의 備忘記를 나리니 左承旨 李蓍晩, 修撰 李萬元, 大臣 李尙眞 등이 力諫하다가 罷職 或 竄逐을 當하고 應校 朴素輔, 判書 吳斗寅, 參判 李世華 등 80여인은 上疏하다가 疎意가 觸怒되야 疏頭 朴泰輔, 李世華. 吳斗寅 등은 가진 惡刑을 당하다가 遠地에 流配된 바, 朴吳 兩人은 中途에서 刑毒으로 死k고 또 前日 元子冊封時에 反對하다가 被謫한 宋時烈, 金壽恒, 李師命 등을 賜死하고 閔氏의 諸族中 有官者는 다 削職한 후 5월 4일에 閔妃는 安國洞 本家(卽 感古堂)에 幽閉하고 供上米와 內殿水剌進御까지 停止하는 同時에 一方으로 張氏는 陞하야 王妃로 封하고 其父 張烱은 玉山府院君, 母尹氏와 高氏는 各히 府夫人을 封하고 그을아비 張希載는 訓練大將을 封하매 當時 政權은 殆히 張氏의 手中에 잇엇다. 이 政變은 朝鮮近代政變史上에 가장 殺戮이 만흔 政變이엿다

張禧嬪과 崔淑嬪

張禧嬪은 一個後宮의 賤身으로 이와가티 一朝에 中宮의 貴位를 占奪하고 一門의 親戚이 道의 富貴榮華를 누리게 되니 그 驕肆橫暴함이 날로 느러갈 것은 勿論이엿다. 內로는 閔妃一派의 勢力을 根本的으로 掃滅하기 爲하야 平素에 민비와 接近하던 사람은 至於宮人掖卒이라도 다 逐出하고 甚한 때에는 刺客을 보내 幽閉된 閔妃를 暗殺을 圖하며 外로는 南人과 結黨을 단단이 하야 西人이라고는 政權을 敢히 窺視치 못하게 하고 肅宗이 다른 후궁을 寵愛할가하야 嚴密한 監視를 하니 肅宗도 漸次 張氏를 忌惡하는 생각이 나고, 따러서 廢妃한 것을 다시 後悔하는 일도 업진 안엇섯다. 어느날 밤이엿다. 夜巡잘하는 肅宗은 달빛을 따러 宮中에서 散策할세 엇던 女官의 방 近處를 지내느라닛가 밤이 이미 깁품에 不拘하고 등촉이 아즉 煌煌한지라 肅宗은 怪異히 녁여 窓틈으로 엿본 즉 엇던 女官 한 아가 壁上에 廢妃의 位牌를 爲해 놋코 진수성찬을 차려가지고 祭禮를 行한다. 肅宗은 그 女官을 불너서 事由를 물은즉, 女官은 惶恐無地하야 업되여 대답하되, 小婢는 원래 閔宮의 厚恩을 입사윗는데 只今 中宮은 幽閉되야 粗衣惡食으로 可憐한 歲月을 보내는 바 本日은 特히 中宮의 誕日이라 前日가트면 滿朝百官이 獻壽萬歲를 하고 山珍海錯을 供上할터이나 지금은 이와가튼 悲運에 싸여 甚至於 朝夕의 進供까지 걱정을 하게되니, 비록 賤婢나 이날을 當하매 自然 感愴한 눈물이 흘너서 敢히 그대로 잇지 못하고 中宮의 平素조와하시는 飮食을 몃가지 차리여서 微誠을 表하옵던 바 意外에 天眼에 觸하얏스니 萬死無惜이올시다 하니 肅宗도 前日 廢妃當時에 가트면 그 女官을 勿論 당장 處刑斬殺할 것이나 廢妃한 것을 점차 後悔하던 터이라 더욱 마음이 感動되야 閔妃를 생각하는 同時에 그 女官을 特히 寵愛하더니, 뜻밧게 그 女官의 몸에 孕胎가 되엿섯다. 그 때 張氏는 肅宗의 態度가 漸變하는 氣色을 보고 더욱 嚴密하게 肅宗의 行動을 偵察하던 中, 그 女官이 肅宗의 寵顧한 바 되야 孕胎까지 된 所聞을 듯고는 例의 毒婦의 嫉妬心이 暴發하야 그 女官을 잡아다가 불로 지지고 몽치로 따려서 가진 惡刑을 다한 다음에 독속ㅇ 다가두워두웟섯다. 그 事實을 全然히 알지 못하는 肅宗은 偶然히 張氏의 잇는 宮中으로 드러간 즉 平素에 업던 독 한 개가 庭中에 잇고, 여러 가지의 刑具가 곳곳이 흐터저 잇스며 張氏의 顔色에는 毒氣가 滿滿하야 當場에 무슨 큰 일을 친 사람가티 보엿다. 肅宗은 크게 疑心하고 宮奴를 命하야 庭中에 잇는 독을 치우게 하니 千萬뜻밧게 滿腹한 女子 한 아가 全身에 流血이 浪藉하고 머리털이 散散하야 呻吟하고 잇섯다. 肅宗은 자서이 살펴보니 그는 平素에 自己가 寵愛하던 女官이엿다. 急히 다른 女官을 命하야 그 女官을 救護하야다가 別室에 安臥케 하엿더니 공교히 그날밤에 그 女官은 一個玉童子르 나헛스니(甲戌 9월 13일)卽 李朝季葉에 一大英主인 英宗大王이요, 그 女官은 곳 淑嬪 崔氏엿다.

金春澤의 陰謀와 閔氏復位

己巳以後로 一敗倒地한 西人은 겨우 殘息을 保存할 따름이엿스나 自己勢力挽回運動에는 조금도 겨을느지 아니하얏다. 그 運動의 前衛猛將은 例의 才氣勃勃하고 陰謀性이 豊富한 北軒 金春澤이엿다. 그는 먼저 文章을 弄하야 少尉『倡善感義錄』이라는 小說을 지여 宮中에 流入케하야 肅宗의 마음을 感動식히고 民間으로는 또 『장다리』童謠(메나리는 사철이요 장다리는 한철이라, 等語나 卽 메나리는 閔氏, 장다리는 張氏를 地積함으로서 閔氏는 항상 잘되고 張氏는 一時에 不過하다는 뜻이다)를 퍼치여 民心을 收拾하며 또 一方으로 韓重爀, 康晩泰 등과 金錢을 收合하야 千金으로 宮人의 妹를 買하야 己妾을 삼고 賂物로 張希載의 妻妾을 交結하야 (希載의 妻 『자근아긔』는 奸通까지 하고 妾 淑正(淑正은 本 東平君의 女婢로 東平이 希載에게 納한 것이다)도 密結하얏다) 宮內와 張家의 秘密을 探偵하얏다. 그러다가 肅宗 20년 甲戌 4월 2일에 春澤의 『聚銀交通, 復后換局』등 陰謀가 入聞되매 右相 閔黯이 咸以完으로 變을 告케하야 上의 允可로 金春澤, 韓重爀, 李時檜, 崔格 등 수십인을 禁府에 下하고, 判義禁 柳命賢, 訓將 李義徵으로 罪를 治케 함야 取招結案의 手續까지 畢하얏스나 때는 마츰 日暮한 까닭으로 行刑치 못하고 其翌日로 延期하엿다.<13> 그러나 翻雲覆雨의 變態無常한 肅宗은 其夜二更에 突然히 態度를 變하야 春澤 등의 治罪하던 大臣以下의 宮爵을 全部削奪하야 門外로 黜送하고 閔黯과 禁府堂上은 絶島에 安置할 事를 命하는 同時에 訓將 李義徵의 兵符를 奪하야 申汝哲로 其職을 代하고 尹趾完으로 御將을 除授하며 其他 一斑大官을 全部 西人으로 登用하고 金春澤은 滅死定配하고 其外는 다 參酌放送하며 己巳廢妃時에 放逐削爵한 사람을 다 伸寃復職하니 이는 南人과 張氏에 對한 靑天霹靂이엿다. 이 急激한 政變은 勿論 平素에 南人과 張氏의 橫暴에 肅宗이 만은 宿憾을 가젓던 것이 큰 原因이엿지만은 內幕에는 春澤이 宮人을 買收하야 南人一派와 張氏를 讒害한 陰謀가 伏在하야 春澤의 事가 發覺되며 急轉直下로 爆開된 것이엿다. 이것은 西人과 閔妃의 幸이라 할지 南人과 張氏의 不幸이라 할지 不知하거니와 賄賂, 奸淫 등으로 政變을 이르킨 것은 醜態라면 그보다 더 큰 醜態가 업고, 活劇이라면 그긔에 더 지내는 活劇은 업슬 것이다.
閒話休題-이 急激의 政變을 일으킨 西人一派는 第一着으로 다시 閔妃復位運動을 開始하니 肅宗이 또한 前非를 悔悟하고 9일에는 傳敎를 下하야 閔妃를 私第로부터 於義宮에 移御케하고 12일에는 다시 入闕케 한 後, 그의 親家父母의 爵號를 復하고 閔妃를 다시 復冊하는 同時에 張氏王后의 璽綬를 거두고 仍하야 前爵인 禧嬪으로 降封하며 其父母의 爵號敎旨를 收하야 燒火하며 廢妃의 玉寶는 다시 毁破하야 地中에 埋置하고 自今以後로는 邦家에서 嬪으로 封后하는 事를 嚴禁하는 制例를 삼고, 張氏弟 希載는 前日中宮이 私第에 幽閉되엿슬때에 謀害하얏다는 嫌疑(卽 所謂 諺書事件)도 極刑에 處하기로 論하얏스나 當時 世子의 年齡이 겨우 7세요, 事가 禧嬪까지 밋침으로 南九萬外某某重臣의 末由로 死를 滅하야 濟州에 遠竄하니 一時 榮華富貴를 자랑하던 張氏의 勢力도 그만 一場春夢으로 化하고 마럿다.

所謂 巫蟲變과 張氏의 最後

張氏는 自己의 잘못이야 잇섯던지 업섯던지 自己의 所生한 아들이 이미 一國의 世子가 되엿고, 自己도 또한 一國의 王后가 되엿섯는데 一朝에 廢位削爵을 當할 뿐안이라, 자기의 父母까지 奪爵을 하고 愛弟 希載는 極地에 遠竄까지 하니 그 寃恨이야 엇지 普通의 女官이 一時寵幸하다가 失寵한 데다가 比하리요. 더구나 自己의 政敵인 閔妃가 自己의 아들을 차지하야 가지고 所生母인 自己와는 面形도 相對치 못하게 하는 것는 무엇보다도 痛切한 怨恨이엿다,(張氏廢黜後 世子와 對面치도 안케함) 그리하야 비록 深宮一隅에 幽處하얏스나 再次 政變을 이르키랴고 腐心하얏다. 外로는 被黜한 南人의 殘黨에 다시 秋波를 보내서 捲土重來도 計劃하고, 內로는 朝鮮의 一大迷信이요, 李朝宮中에 傳來的 惡習인 咀呪(俗稱예방)을 行하야 閔氏를 謀害하며 또 張氏先墓에다 世子의 生年月日을 쓴 木偶를 埋藏하고 西人을 謀害코자 하얏다.(所謂 丙子年 業同(人名)의 埋凶事件) 그럭저럭 肅宗 27년 辛巳가 되엿다. 그 前해 庚辰年부터<14> 痰瘇으로 呻吟하던 閔妃는 百藥이 無效하고 同年 8월 14일에 35세를 一期로 하고 奄然이 昇遐하니 肅宗은 그가 一點血肉이 업시 일즉이 죽은 것과 또 前日 幽囚當時 고생하던 身勢를 불상이 녁여 항상 悲痛하엿섯다. 平素부터 꿈 잘뀌기로 有名한 肅宗(肅宗은 夢事를 가지고 政事時에도 만이 말을 하엿다)은 晝思夜夢이라할지 하루밤은 꿈을 뀌매 前日에 죽은 內侍한 아가 와서 拜奏하되 宮中에 妖한 일이 만어서 中宮이 禍를 입고 장차 殿下와 世子도 不利한 일이 잇스리라하고 손으로 就善堂(張氏宮)을 가르치고 가며 그 뒤를 또 이여서는 閔妃가 滿身血痕으로 와서 말하되 臣妾의 死한 것은 本命이 안이요, 張氏의 咀呪한 所以라 하고 因忽不見하니 肅宗이 大驚大怪하야 卽時 微行으로 張氏 處所로 가서 엿본즉, 때는 벌서 三更이나 되엿는데 張氏가 모든 侍女와 希載의 妾 淑正과 가티 모혀서 예방한 諸具를 모다 모와가지고 수쇄하는 中이엿다. 그것은 勿論 張氏가 平素에 閔氏를 저주하다가 閔氏 死後에 그것을 업시하는 것이엇다. 肅宗은 별안간 門을 열고 詰問한 즉 모도 驚惶망조하야 或은 世子 痘患때에 祝願하던 것이니, 或은 中宮患候平復을 祈禱하던 것이니 하고, 말이 各出하니 肅宗이 그 夢事를 더욱 신긔하게 생각가는 同時에 張氏의 所行을 크게 忿怒하야 張氏를 指目하되 國母를 殺害코자 하는 逆徒라 하고 9월 24일에 傳敎를 나려 張氏의 前後罪惡을 列擧하고 卽時 自死게 하며 濟州에 流配한 張希載는 물론 宮人丑生, 雪香, 時英, 淑英, 鐵生, 貞伊, 一烈 等과 希載의 妻妾 其他 此에 關聯된 者 數十人을 極刑에 處하니 此卽 辛巳巫蠱의 變이엿다.
然而 張氏가 臨死할 때에도 一大悲劇이 演出하엿스니 卽 張氏는 츠음에 그 無罪한 것을 極口辨明하얏스나 肅宗이 一向 듯지 안이함으로 張氏는ㄴ 그 不免한 것을 알고 最後로 其子 景宗이나 한번 만나 보기를 願하니 肅宗도 그것은 拒絶치 못하고 永訣로 相對케 하얏더니 張氏는 母子相抱하고  一場痛哭을 하다가 最後로 毒婦의 本色을 發露하야 갈오대 내가 이왕 죽을 진대 엇지 子息으로 閔哥와 李哥의 奉祀를 하게 하리요 하고 달러드러 景宗의 睪丸을 잡아채니 景宗은 그 자리에 昏倒하야 몃時間人事를 不省하다가 幸히 救護되고(時에 景宗이 纔 14歲니 景宗의 平生 宿疴와 無子도 此에 基因함) 張氏는 賜藥一器로 可憐히 죽으니, 嗚呼 佳人의 薄命도 薄命이어니와, 人間의 無情이 엇지 此極에 達할가 漢武帝가 召帝로 太子를 삼고서도 其母 鉤弋夫人을 殺한 古例가 업는 바는 안이지만은 이와가티 慘虐한 일은 歷史上 듬은 일이엿다. 春風秋雨 數百年을 經하야 張氏의 封后하든 己巳는 다시 도라왓다. 昌慶苑에 꼿이 피고 仁章里(張氏墓所) 松林에 杜鵑이 슬피울때에 當時 一世의 女傑이오, 佳人인 張氏의 薄命한 죽엄을 생각하면, 그 누가 눈물을 흘이지 안이하랴.<15>
