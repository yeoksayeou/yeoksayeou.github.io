Factional Strife in Korea
						Cha Sang-chan

Introduction

Recently, the renowned Confucian scholar, Ningjae Yi Geon-chang, wrote "A Comprehensive Discussion of Factionalism" (『黨議通略』), providing a thorough account of factional strife in Korean history. He stated, "In the Eastern Han, Tang, and Song dynasties, there were factions, but only our dynasty was consumed by this, spanning hundreds of years, with no clarity on what was right or wrong. This is the most extreme and prolonged case of factionalism in ancient and modern times." As he said, the factional strife in Korea was truly the most extreme and prolonged in ancient and modern history. Throughout the 519 years of the Joseon Dynasty, approximately 300 years were entirely consumed by this factional strife (including literati purges), permeating every page of history. It is no exaggeration to say that the history of the Joseon Dynasty is, in one aspect, the history of this factional strife. Political power shifted due to factional strife, royal authority waxed and waned because of it, and even institutions, customs, culture, and all other aspects were subject to its control. Wise rulers and virtuous men, due to factional strife, were branded as traitors and rebels overnight, becoming exiles on remote islands or wronged spirits by the sword or poison. Those who committed heinous acts of treason were publicly executed, only to be later honored as loyal subjects and patriots, receiving posthumous awards and titles. No matter how great a person was, they could not advance in court if they were not part of a faction, and no matter how inferior a person was, if they had the backing of a faction, they could obtain honor and position as easily as picking up a straw. As a result, rulers and subjects mistrusted each other, and officials and the people ostracized and killed each other, so that within the 3,000-li land of Korea, the sounds of lamentation and the blood of the wronged never ceased. Before factionalism, there was no nation, no ruler, no people, no relatives, and no teachers or disciples. Only the adherence to one's own faction's doctrines and principles mattered. How could this not be the root of national decline and ruin? When King Seonjo was in Uiju, he composed a poem and showed it to his officials, saying, "Weep bitterly at the moon over Guanshan, grieve deeply at the wind over the Yalu River. Officials of the court, from this day forward, let us no longer be divided into east and west." Though the poem consists of only a few simple lines, how sorrowful it is, and how fervently it warns against the factional strife of the officials. However, the officials of that time showed no sign of repentance. Not long after the Imjin War, the strife between the Southern and Northern factions arose, and subsequently, the factional strife between the Greater and Lesser Northerners and between the Western and Southern factions intensified. <2> In the Byeongja year of King Injo, the Qing invaded, and there was no plan for defense. The rulers and subjects suffered the humiliation of surrender within the castle. Still not content, they continued factional strife for generations, ultimately leading to the tragic demise of the nation. How can this not be lamented? Discussing this now is like debating medical prescriptions after the funeral, but how can we know that this will not serve as a warning from the past?

1. Causes of Factional Strife

There are various theories regarding the causes of factional strife. Some attribute it to the abuses of private academies (seowon) (e.g., Park Je-hyung's "Joseon Politics Reflected" (朝鮮政鑑)), while others point to eight major factors: excessive emphasis on Neo-Confucianism, overly strict moral principles, excessive formalism in writing, overly harsh legal punishments, overly stern censorial institutions, overly pure officialdom, the dominance of powerful families, and prolonged peace (e.g., Yi Geon-chang's "A Comprehensive Discussion of Factionalism" (黨議通略)). Still others argue that it stemmed from emotional conflicts during the transition between old and new generations (e.g., Japanese literary scholar Heihara Tan's "History of Korean Political Strife" (韓國政爭志)), or simply from the mutual animosity between Sim Ui-gyeom and Kim Hyo-won. However, these can be broadly divided into two categories: remote causes and immediate causes. The remote causes are (1) literati purges (sahwa) and strife among the royal in-laws, and (2) systemic flaws. The immediate causes are (1) discord between the old and new factions of scholars at the time, and (2) the mutual animosity between Sim Ui-gyeom and Kim Hyo-won. While the literati purges and strife among the royal in-laws were major causes of factional strife, the personnel administration (jeonlang) system of the Joseon Dynasty also exacerbated this factional strife. The official system of Joseon originally had the Three Ministers (Samgong: Chief State Councillor, Left State Councillor, and Right State Councillor) and the Six Ministries (Yukjo: Six Ministries), but the appointment and dismissal of officials both inside and outside the capital was not handled by the Three Ministers, but exclusively by the Ministry of Personnel (Ijo). Furthermore, to prevent the concentration of power in the Ministry of Personnel, the selection of officials for the Three Offices (Samsa: Office of the Inspector-General, Office of Censors, and Office of Special Advisors), which were the most important positions at the time, was exclusively handled by the Senior and Junior Censors (Jeongnang and Jwarang) under the Minister of Personnel, without the involvement of the Minister. This was the so-called personnel administration (jeonlang) system, and its actual power was considerable. Therefore, these Senior and Junior Censors were specially selected from among those with virtue in the Three Offices, and they were allowed to recommend their successors, without being subordinate to the head of the office. Thus, promotion in rank would first go through the Senior and Junior Censors before reaching other offices, and once one had served as a Senior or Junior Censor, one could usually rise to the rank of a high-ranking official without major setbacks. The central government's leadership consisted of the State Council (Uijeongbu), formed by the consensus of the Three Ministers, but since the 15th year of King Myeongjong's reign, this became nominal, and the Border Defense Council (Bibyeonsa) (also known as the Bibyeog or Chuguk), composed of senior civil and military officials, became the de facto highest authority, deciding state affairs. Thus, the organization of the central government of the Joseon Dynasty was quite anomalous, and among them, figures like the Senior and Junior Censors presented an even more anomalous situation, naturally fostering factions. The mutual animosity between Sim Ui-gyeom and Kim Hyo-won, which I will discuss below, was in fact rooted in private grievances related to this personnel administration system. Next, the primary immediate cause was the discord between the old and new factions of scholars at the time. Of course, factions naturally existed among scholars since the Eulsa Literati Purge (乙巳士禍), but by the beginning of King Seonjo's reign, the discord between the old and new factions had become even more severe. This can be seen by examining the posthumous memorial of Donggo Yi Jun-gyeong, who was the Chief State Councillor at the time, and the opposition to it, which would be enough to glimpse the situation. Yi Jun-gyeong was the Chief State Councillor who succeeded Yun Won-hyeong and, having received King Myeongjong's mandate, welcomed King Seonjo to the throne, serving as Chief State Councillor until the fourth year of his reign. As the Head of the Royal Secretariat, he submitted the following posthumous memorial to King Seonjo in July of the 5th year of King Seonjo's reign, before passing away. "Now" <3> (pages 4-10 missing from the original) <4> near the bottom), while Yi's family was in Jeongneung-dong in the western part of the city (now Jeong-dong). Those who sided with Kim were called Easterners (Dongin), and those who sided with Sim were called Westerners (Seoin), marking the beginning of the East-West factional division. This occurred in the eighth year of King Seonjo's reign, the Eulhae year, and is therefore also known as the Eulhae Factional Strife (乙亥朋黨). (At the time, Great Censor Heo Ye strongly recommended Kim Hyo-won despite being his senior, becoming the leader of the Easterners, and Right State Councillor Park Sun, who had a reputation for integrity and was also a senior figure, became the leader of the Westerners.)

However, the factional strife that lasted for over 330 years from the time of the East-West division in the eighth year of King Seonjo's reign until the end of the Joseon Dynasty had a significant impact on politics, both directly and indirectly. The course of the conflict was also intricate and complex, making it difficult to describe in detail within a limited space. However, for the sake of convenience, I would like to divide this into six periods and discuss the general outline.

2. The Ascendancy of the Easterners and the Division into Southern and Northern Factions

This period spans approximately 50 years from the eighth year of King Seonjo's reign to the fifteenth year of King Gwanghaegun's reign. In the eighth year of King Seonjo's reign, when the East-West factions divided, Yulgok Yi I served as Deputy Director and tried to reconcile them, but failing to achieve any results, he temporarily resigned from his position. Later, he re-entered the court as Great Censor, holding important positions such as Minister of War and Minister of Personnel. Although he was a mediator of the factions, his followers were Westerners, so he implicitly supported the Westerners, and as a result, the power of the Westerners greatly expanded. However, Yulgok died of illness in the seventeenth year of King Seonjo's reign, and Yi San-hae succeeded him as Minister of Personnel, and No Su-sin became Chief State Councillor, and Yu Seong-ryong became Minister of Rites. These three were all prominent figures of the Easterners, so the power of the Easterners became strong again, and the power of the Westerners gradually declined. In the twenty-second year of King Seonjo's reign, Jeong Yeo-rip, a Westerner who had joined the Easterners, was executed for treason, and the Easterners faced a time of great fear. However, the Easterners originally had a solid power base and were in a position that was difficult to uproot. Later, in the twenty-fourth year of King Seonjo's reign, the Easterners divided again into Southern and Northern factions. The reason for this division was nothing more than the difference in the degree of severity in repelling the opposing Westerners, with the hardliners being the Northerners and the softliners being the Southerners. The leader of the hardliners was Yi Bal, who was supported by Yi San-hae, and the leader of the softliners was U Seong-jeon, who was supported by Yu Seong-ryong. Yi's family was located at the foot of Mount Bugak, so their faction was called the Northerners, and U Seong-jeon's family was located at the foot of Mount Namsan, so their faction was called the Southerners. This is the division and strife between the Southern and Northern factions. However, during the Imjin War, when Yu Seong-ryong, the leader of the Southerners, held power for many years, there was little factional strife because the nation was facing a time of crisis. But as the war gradually subsided, the embers reignited, and Nam Yi-gong of the Northerners impeached Seoae for advocating peace, depriving him of his official rank. The Southerners lost their footing, and the Northerners took over the government in their place (the end of King Seonjo's reign). However, the Northerners soon experienced further division, splitting into the Greater Northerners (Daebuk) and Lesser Northerners (Sobeok). The Greater Northerners further divided into Central Northerners, Flesh Northerners, and Bone Northerners. At the end of King Seonjo's reign, Ryu Yeong-gyeong, the leader of the Lesser Northerners, became Chief State Councillor, and his power also grew greatly.

Strife between the Greater and Lesser Northerners

The strife between the Greater and Lesser Northerners can be said to be a good example of how factionalists regarded the ancestral system of selecting heirs as playthings. This concerns the issue of King Seonjo's succession to the throne. Initially, King Seonjo's Queen Park had no heir, and a crown prince had not yet been designated. The Imjin War broke out, and King Seonjo was forced to flee, so he reluctantly appointed his concubine's son, Gwanghaegun, as crown prince. Later, Queen Inmok, née Kim Je-nam's daughter, succeeded Queen Park and gave birth to Grand Prince Yeongchang (Gye). The issue of changing the crown prince suddenly arose among the court officials (there was also a relationship with the Ming Dynasty, but this is omitted). Ryu Yeong-gyeong's Lesser Northern faction sought to support the Grand Prince, while Yi I-cheom's Greater Northern faction defended Gwanghaegun, leading to a major dispute. However, King Seonjo passed away, and King Gwanghaegun ascended the throne and appointed Yi I-cheom (previously, Yi I-cheom strongly requested the abdication, and he was exiled, but before he could reach his destination, King Seonjo, gravely ill, summoned him). Yi I-cheom raised suspicions and killed Ryu Yeong-gyeong, as well as Kim Je-nam, the queen's father, his three sons, and one son-in-law. Grand Prince Yeongchang, who was only 8 years old at the time, was boiled to death in a secret room on Ganghwa Island, and the Grand Prince's mother, Queen Inmok, was deposed and confined to the Western Palace. In addition, Prince Imhae (Jin) and Prince Jeongwon (Bo) were also harmed. This tragic event can be described as a major tragedy in the history of Joseon's factional strife. However, at this time, the Lesser Northerners opposed the removal of the Queen Mother, but their arguments were not unified, and they further divided into Clear Lesser Northerners and Turbid Lesser Northerners, suffering a crushing defeat at the hands of the Greater Northerners. This period during King Gwanghaegun's reign can be said to be the era of the Greater Northerners.

3. The Total Destruction of the Greater Northerners and the Resistance of the Western and Southern Factions

The period from the first year of King Injo's reign to the 15th year of King Hyeonjong's reign, approximately 50 years, can be described as the period of the total destruction of the Greater Northerners and the resistance of the Western and Southern factions. In March of the 15th year of King Gwanghaegun's reign, the Westerners Yi Gwi, Kim Ja-jeom, Kim Ryu, and Yi Gwal raised the banner of restoration, deposed King Gwanghaegun, and enthroned King Injo. At the same time, they restored the titles of Grand Princes Yeongchang and Imhae and Kim Je-nam, and executed dozens of Greater Northern followers, including Yi I-cheom and Jeong In-hong, and exiled 100 members of their faction. This period marks the total destruction of the Greater Northerners. However, among the Westerners who seized power after eliminating the Greater Northerners, Yi Gwi, Kim Ryu, and others were called Merit Westerners (Gongseo) or Honored Westerners (Hunseo) due to their meritorious service, and Kim Sang-heon, who was a figure in the opposition, was called Clear Westerner (Cheongseo), leading to another division. This was similar to the division between the Southern and Northern factions, with the difference only being in the degree of severity towards the opposing party. Also, among the ruling party, the Merit Westerners, there were the Old Westerner (Noseo) and Young Westerner (Soseo) factions. The Old Westerner faction (Kim Ryu and others, softliners) sought to maintain compromise with the Southerners, while the Young Westerner faction (Yi Gwi and others, hardliners) opposed this. Later, at the end of King Injo's reign, further divisions occurred, with the Merit Westerners splitting into the Original Party (Wondang) and the Nakdang (Kim Ja-jeom faction), and the Clear Westerners giving rise to the Sand Party (Sandang) and the Han Party (Handang). Among them, the Sand Party was mainly composed of scholars from Yeonsan, Chungnam Province, led by Kim Jang-saeng (Sagyedang), a scholar from Yeonsan, and his son, Kim Jip (Sindeokjae), encompassing all the scholars of Yeonsan and Hoedeok. Song Jun-gil and Song Si-yeol, disciples of Sagyedang, also participated in this Sand Party. Thus, the Westerners experienced numerous divisions, but during the reign of King Injo, the Hunseo faction held the upper hand. It should also be noted that by the time of King Hyojong's reign, Kim Ja-jeom of the Nakdang was executed, and Song Si-yeol, a proponent of the Northern Expedition, became Left State Councillor, and Kim Jun-gil became Minister of Personnel, so the power of the Sand Party also greatly increased.

Strife between the Southern and Western Factions

However, it is worth mentioning the position of the Southerners. The Southerners had not held power since Yu Seong-ryong, and after the Injo Restoration, Yi Won-ik of Ori became Chief State Councillor, and 12 Southerners held key positions, only maintaining potential power. However, during the reign of King Hyeonjong, the strife between the Western and Southern factions is noteworthy. The first instance occurred at the beginning of King Hyeonjong's reign, concerning the mourning period for Queen Dowager Jaui (King Injo's second queen, née Jo), with Song Si-yeol and others advocating for a one-year mourning period (ginyeonseol), while the Southerners Yun Hyu (Baekho) and Heo Mok (Misu) advocated for a three-year mourning period. The second instance occurred at the end of King Hyeonjong's reign, concerning the mourning period for Queen Inseon (King Hyojong's queen, née Jang), who had passed away. Song advocated for the "Daegongseol" (nine months), while Yun advocated for the "Ginyeonseol" (one year). As the conflict between the two theories intensified, King Hyeonjong adopted Yun's theory, which ultimately reduced the power of the Westerners and increased the power of the Southerners. At the end of the same reign, Heo Jeok of the Southerners became Chief State Councillor, and subsequently, at the beginning of King Sukjong's reign, the Southerners Gwon Da-un and Heo Mok became Left and Right State Councillors, their power growing increasingly strong. They greatly attacked Song Si-yeol, and Song Si-yeol, who had held considerable power for a time, was stripped of his official titles and exiled to Janggi County. Among the Southerners at the time, the party was further divided based on the degree of severity towards the Westerners into the Clear Southerners (Heo Jeok) and the Turbid Southerners (Gwon Da-un).

As seen above, the rise and fall of the factions was quite complex. In summary, during the approximately 100 years from the factional division in the 8th year of King Seonjo's reign to the end of King Hyeonjong's reign, the Easterners were in power for the first 50 years, and the Westerners held the upper hand for the last 50 years.

4. The Downfall of the Southerners and the Division between the Old and Young Factions

This factional strife occurred from the first year of King Sukjong's reign to the 29th year of the same reign, a period of approximately 20 years. Initially, Heo Jeok, the leader of the Southerners, received King Hyeonjong's mandate to assist King Sukjong. At the time, King Sukjong was only 14 years old and prone to illness, and there were many rebels among the royal family. Heo Jeok's illegitimate son, Heo Gyeon, conspired with them to stage a coup (colluding with Princes Bokchang (Jeong) and Bokseon (Nam), sons of Prince Inpyeong). However, this was uncovered by Military Commander Kim Seok-ju, and Heo Jeok and his son, as well as Yun Hyu and dozens of others, were executed, and over 100 Southerners were dismissed. This is the Gyeongsindaeok of the 6th year of King Sukjong. After the Southerners were wiped out, Kim Seok-ju and Kim Ik-hun (Kim Jang-saeng's grandson) were rewarded for their contributions. Ik-hun became Commander of the Royal Guard, Kim Su-hang became Chief State Councillor, Min Jeong-jung became Left State Councillor, and Kim Seok-ju became Right State Councillor. Song Si-yeol was also recalled and entered the court, his reputation sweeping the world, and the power of the Westerners greatly increased. However, many of the younger Westerners opposed Kim Seok-ju's actions, leading to another division into the Old and Young factions. Those who supported Kim Seok-ju and Kim Ik-hun were the Old Faction (Noron), while Han Tae-dong and Jo Chi-gyeom, who opposed them, were the so-called Young Faction (Soron). In the 9th year of King Sukjong's reign, another dispute arose over the issue of rituals between Song Si-yeol and Yun Jeung (Myeongjae) and Park Se-chae. Song became affiliated with the Old Faction, and Yun became affiliated with the Young Faction, forming the famous Battle of Hoeni (Hoedeok and Niseong), after which the conflict between the Old and Young factions became increasingly fierce. (9th year of King Sukjong - Song Si-yeol proposed the issue of King Hyojong's ancestral shrine and the issue of posthumous titles commemorating the 200th anniversary of King Taejo's return from Wiwha Island, but Yun Jeung opposed it, leading to a fierce dispute between the Old and Young factions.) Later, in the 15th year of King Sukjong's reign, a major clash occurred between the Southerners and Westerners over the issue of crown prince selection. The Southerners Mok Nae-seon, Kim Deok-won, and Min Am gained key positions (Kim and Mok became Left and Right State Councillors), and Song Si-yeol of the Westerners was exiled to Jeju Island at the age of 83 due to the memorials of the Southerners Yi Hyeon-gi, Nam Chi-hun, and Yun Bin. He was later moved to Jeongeup and given poison. O Do-il, Hong Chi-sang, and Kim Ik-hun were either dismissed or exiled, and Kim Su-hang was also given poison. This is the so-called Gihae Hwan-guk (己已換局). (Initially, King Sukjong's Queen Min had no heir, and Royal Concubine Hui, née Jang, gave birth to Prince Gyun (later King Gyeongjong). King Sukjong wanted to depose Queen Min and appoint Prince Gyun as crown prince, <7> but the Westerner Song Si-yeol opposed it, and the Southerners Mok Nae-seon and others supported it, leading to another dispute.) However, in April of the 20th year of King Sukjong's reign, the king regretted his previous actions and distanced himself from the Southerners. The Westerners seized this opportunity to dismiss the Southerners in office, and Nam Gu-man became Chief State Councillor, restoring the Westerner cabinet for the second time. Song Si-yeol was also reinstated.

5. The Era of Major Conflict between the Old and Young Factions

After the Southerners lost power in the 20th year of King Sukjong's reign and power reverted to the Westerners, the situation changed again, becoming a conflict between the Old and Young factions. The approximately 30 years from the 20th year of King Sukjong's reign to the 4th year of King Gyeongjong's reign can be described as the peak of the major conflict between the Old and Young factions. King Gyeongjong was weak and ill and had no hope of producing a royal heir, and also unable to govern. In August of the first year of his reign, the Old Faction petitioned for Prince Yeongjo, the heir apparent, to serve as regent. The leading figures of the Old Faction, including Chief State Councillor Kim Chang-jip, Head of the Royal Secretariat Yi Yi-myeong, Vice Minister Jo Tae-chae, and Yi Geon-myeong (the so-called Four Great Ministers of the Old Faction), all supported this. However, due to the fierce opposition from Jo Tae-gu and other members of the Young Faction, the Old Faction was ultimately defeated, and the Four Great Ministers and their faction were all exiled. Jo Tae-gu and his Young Faction gained power, with Tae-gu becoming Chief State Councillor, and Choi Gyu-seo and Choi Seok-hang becoming Left and Right State Councillors. The political situation once again became the domain of the Young Faction. However, Kim Il-gyeong (Royal Secretary), a radical member of the Young Faction, conspired with the eunuchs Park Sang-gyeom and Mun Yu-do, and palace maids Seok Ryeol and Pil-jeong, to harm the Crown Prince, but they were discovered, and Park and Mun were all executed. The following year, Il-gyeong conspired with Mok Ho-ryong and falsely accused the Old Faction of plotting against the Crown Prince. Kim Chang-jip and the Four Great Ministers and dozens of others were executed, and Baek Mang, Jeong In-jung, Kim Yong-taek, and Yi Cheon-gi were also punished. This is the so-called Sinim Mugok (辛壬誣獄). (Because it spanned the Sinchuk and Imjin years, it is called Sinim, and it is also known as the Imjin Conspiracy.)

6. The Appointment of the Old Faction and the Implementation of Harmonization

The approximately 80 years from the first year of King Yeongjo's reign to the 24th year of King Jeongjo's reign is the so-called period of implementing the Old-Young Faction Harmonization policy. As everyone knows, King Yeongjo and King Jeongjo were enlightened rulers of the late Joseon Dynasty. King Yeongjo issued a proclamation of Tangpyeong (蕩平) at the beginning of his reign, showing it to all officials and commoners, and thoroughly discussed the evils of factional strife, adopting a policy of Old-Young Faction Harmonization. At the beginning of his reign, the Old Faction held key positions, but when the truth of the Imjin Conspiracy was revealed, Kim Il-gyeong and Mok Ho-ryong were executed, and Ryu Bong-hui, Yi Gwang-jwa, and Jo Tae-eok, members of the Young Faction, were exiled. The officials related to the Imjin Conspiracy were reinstated, and the rebellion of Yi In-jwa, a member of Kim Il-gyeong's remnant party, was suppressed. For a time, the presence of the Young Faction disappeared from the palace, and the Old Faction was re-appointed. However, King Yeongjo, seeking to implement a policy of harmonization, knew that it was impossible to entrust power to one party permanently, so he appointed Hong Chi-jung of the Old Faction as Chief State Councillor and Jo Mun-myeong of the Young Faction as Right State Councillor. He also abolished the regulations of the Senior and Junior Censors, which had been a cause of factional strife for 300 years, and enshrined Song Si-yeol of the Old Faction and Park Se-chae of the Young Faction in the Munmyo (文廟) at the same time. This was also a realization of the Tangpyeong policy. Succeeding him, King Jeongjo also inscribed "Tangtangpyeongpyeongsil" (蕩蕩平平室) in his palace chambers and constantly strived for Tangpyeong, so the factional strife that had been fierce in the past gradually subsided. <8>

7. The Zenith of the Old Faction and the Era of Overcoming Factionalism

After Kings Yeongjo and Jeongjo, factional strife was largely mitigated, but the power of the Old Faction remained strong. During the reigns of Kings Sunjo, Heonjong, and Cheoljong, the Old Faction from the royal in-laws controlled the government. Although the tragedies of the past were not seen, other factions could not interfere in state affairs, and until the early years of King Gojong, it felt as if it were still the era of the Old Faction. After the Daewongun (大院君) became regent, he took bold measures to break down the Four Colors (사색) and appoint officials fairly, also employing people outside of the factions. The factional strife of hundreds of years finally came to an end. However, it is a fact that the Old Faction still held power until the annexation period. This can be seen by the fact that among the so-called 76 nobles, only 70 were from the Young Faction and one was from the Northern Faction, with the rest being almost entirely from the Old Faction.

8. The Impact of Factional Strife on Society

The negative impact of factional strife on politics in each period has been described above, and its impact on society was also significant. Here, I will briefly discuss it.

1. Impact on General Public Sentiment

It goes without saying that factional strife had a negative impact on general public sentiment. Among the most prominent effects were: first, it caused mutual alienation among all classes of society, leading to the lack of unity among Koreans today; second, it led to a loss of standards for judging the good and bad of individuals and loyalty and rebellion, as people were only focused on defending their own faction; and third, it destroyed ethics and morality (e.g., brothers and uncles divided into different factions).

2. Impact on Scholarship

Factional strife ultimately resulted in the victory of the Old Faction, and the Old Faction always had more power than the Young Faction, making it easy to obtain high positions regardless of scholarship or talent. However, after the Southerners and Northerners lost power once, they had no power in the political world, so they naturally turned to other areas. Among them, many Southerners devoted themselves to the study of poetry, calligraphy, and political economy. Famous works by scholars such as Yu Hyeong-won's "Bangyesurok" (磻溪隨錄), Yi Ik's "Seonghosaseol" (星湖僿說), Jeong Yak-yong's "Mokminsimseo" (牧民心書), Yi Jung-hwan's "Palyeokji" (八域志), and others were produced. As a result of the emergence of free-thinking literary scholars, they freely studied Buddhism and Taoism, which were being rejected at the time. It is noteworthy that Catholicism was introduced through the hands of the Southerners, and Donghak (東學), which arose in Korea, originated from this Southern lineage. (Choe Su-un (崔水雲), the founder of Cheondogyo (天道敎), was also a member of the Southern Faction.) This is ultimately the result of Confucianism being entirely monopolized by the Old Faction, and the path to officialdom being almost completely blocked except for the Old Faction.

3. Impact on Marriage

Even among the same noble class, it was customary not to marry someone from a different faction, and if they inevitably had to marry someone from a different faction, they thought of it as if commoners or illegitimate children were marrying into noble families, mutually ostracizing each other, saying that they had lost status or married into a lower class. This custom still remains today, and there is a tendency among the elders to reject marriages between different factions. <9>

9. Characteristics of Each Faction and Their Regional Distribution

According to Nam Ha-jeong's "Tongso Manrok" (桐巢漫錄), each of the Four Colors (사색) had its own characteristics. The Old Faction was often stern and severe, the Young Faction lacked sincerity, the Lesser Northern Faction favored appearances, and the Eastern Faction (referring to the Southern Faction) was gentle and kind, but also foolish, but did not lose the true nature of the Eastern land. Whether this is appropriate or not, it is true that the languages, actions, and personalities of the Four Colors differed because their customs, marriages, and other living environments were different. And until before the Gapo Reform (甲午), the regional bases of the factions were also different. Because Seoul (京城) was the capital, all Four Colors gathered there. Gyeongsang Province was the wellspring of the Sarim faction and Yu Seong-ryong (류성룡) who claimed descent from Yi T'oe-gye was based in Andong, so with Andong and Yean as its center, the Gyeongsang area felt like the homeland of the Southern Faction. In Chungcheong Province, Kim Jang-saeng, a Westerner and disciple of Yulgok, was in Yeonsan, and his school, Song Si-yeol and Song Jun-gil, was in Hoedeok, so the descendants and followers of Yeonsan, Hoedeok, and Taejeon were mostly Westerners. Nonsan (formerly Noseong) was the hometown of Yun Myeong-jae, so there were many members of the Young Faction in that vicinity. Gyeonggi and Gangwon were inhabited by the Old, Young, and Southern Factions. In Haeju, Hwanghae Province, there were some descendants of Yi Yulgok and his Western followers. And in Hamgyeong and Pyongan Provinces, there were few yangban in the past, so the Four Colors were also insignificant. In Jeolla Province, there were no high officials since the mid-Joseon Dynasty, and there were few prominent families, so there were only a few notable families besides the four men from Jeolla: Jeong Song-gang, Kim Ha-seo, and Gi Go-bong. (This is based on Yi Jung-hwan's "Palyeokji," written by a Southerner.) <10>

朝鮮의 黨爭
						車相瓚
緖言

근래 한학자로 유명한 寧齋 李建昌 선생은 일즉이 『黨議通略』을 저하야 朝鮮由來의 당쟁을 통론하되 『東漢唐宋이 擧皆朋黨이 잇섯스나 일국을 擧하야 此에 몰두하고 수백년을 亘하야 其邪正順逆이 명백치 못한 것은 유독 我朝 뿐으로 此는 古今朋黨의 지대 지난 至久한 자라』고 云하얏다. 그의 말과 가티 朝鮮의 당쟁이야말로 참 고금에 지대지극하고 또 至久하기 其比가 무한 者이다. 享國 519년간에 약 3백여 년은 전혀 이 당쟁(士禍幷)으로 역사의 全頁을 통하얏다. 李朝의 역사는 一方으로 보면 이 당쟁의 역사라 云하여도 과언이 안이다. 정권도 이 당쟁으로 좌우되고 왕권도 이 당쟁으로 消長되고 乃至制度 풍속문물 그 모든 것이 이 당쟁의 지배를 밧지 안은 것이 업다. 현인군자도 이 당쟁의 관계로 一朝에 亂臣逆子의 陋名을 입어 孤島絶海의 유객이 되거나 혹은 凶劍毒藥의 冤鬼가 되고 大逆不道로 行尸顯戮을 당한 자도 일시에 또 충신열사가 되야 敍勳封爵을 하며 또 여하한 위대한 인물이라도 당파가 안이면 朝路에 進치 못하고 여하한 열등의 인물이라도 파당의 배경만 잇으면 榮爵을 拾芥와 가티 취하엿다. 그리하야 군신이 서로 疑懼하고 士民이 서로 排斥殺戮하야 3천리 槿域의 내에는 哀號의 聲과 冤抑의 血이 끄칠 날이 업섯다. 당쟁의 전에는 국가도 군왕도 민족도 친척도 사제도 다 업섯다. 다만 自黨의 주의주장만 관철하면 만족할 뿐이엿다. 이것이 엇지 敗族亡國의 本이 안이고 무엇이랴. 宣祖대왕은 義州에 파월하얏슬 때에 一詩를 作하야 군신에게 示하되 『痛哭關山月, 傷心鴨水風, 朝臣今日後, 寧復各西東』이라 하얏다. 그 詩가 비록 간단한 數句에 불과하나 그 얼마나 비통하며 또 群臣의 늋�쟁을 戒함이 얼마나 激切하냐 그러나 당시의 朝臣은 少毫도 改省이 無하야 壬亂 後 不過幾日에 남북인의 분쟁이 生하고 또 繼하야 大小北의 당쟁과 서남인의 당쟁이 激甚하다가＜2＞ 仁祖 丙子에 淸寇가 一至하매 防禦의 策이 無하고 군신이 城不의 굴욕을 당하얏스며 그러고도 尙又 부족하야 世世黨爭을 是事하다가 최후에는 국가가 멸망하는 비운에까지 至하얏스며 此가 엇지 痛歎할 배 안이랴. 이제와서 此를 논하는 것은 맛치 成服後 藥方文을 論함과 가튼 感이 업지 안이하나 또한 엇지 他山의 石이 되지 안흘는지 알 수 잇스랴.

1. 黨爭의 原因
당쟁의 원인은 種種의 說이 有하야 혹은 서원의 弊에 잇다하고(例如朴齊烔 朝鮮政鑑) 혹은 道學太重, 名義太嚴, 文詞太繁, 形獄太密, 臺閣太峻, 宦職太淸, 閥閱太盛, 昇平太久 등 8대 요인에 잇다하고(例如李建昌 黨議通略) 혹은 신구교대의 際에 起한 감정의 충돌이라 하고(例如日本文學博士幣原坦 韓國政爭志) 又 或은 단순히 沈義謙과 金孝元의 반목질시에서 기인하얏다 한다. 그러나 此를 大別하면 遠因 및 近因 兩者가 有하니 卽 원인은 (1) 士禍 및 外戚분쟁과 (2) 制度上 缺陷이요 近因은 (1) 당시 士類 간의 新舊不和와 (2)沈義謙 및 金孝元의 반목질시다. 然而 士禍 및 外戚의 분쟁이 당쟁의 주요원인이 됨은 玆에 贅論할 여지도 업거니와 李朝의 銓郞制度는 또한 此 黨爭을 馴致하얏다. 云치 안이치 못하겟다. 由來朝鮮의 官制에는 三公(領議政左右議政) 六卿(六曺判書)을 置하얏스나 내외관직의 除拜는 三公이 하지안코 專혀 吏曹에 속하고 又 吏曹의 權이 편중함을 慮하야 당시에 最重職인 三司(司憲府, 司諫院, 弘文館)의 任選은 吏判의 下에 在한 正郞佐郞으로 專行케 하고 判書는 관여치 안케 하얏스니 此가 즉 소위 銓郞으로 그 실권이 자못 위대하고 從하야 此銓郞은 三司 중에 明德이 有한 자로 特選하야 此를 임명하고 又 銓郞은 그 후임을 自薦함을 許하되 결코 장관에 屬지 안이 하얏섯다. 그럼으로 품계의 승진과 如한 것도 먼저 銓郞에 陞하고 후에 他司에 及하며 一次 銓郞을 經하면 別로 大故가 無한 限에는 平步로 公卿에 上함을 可得하엿다. 그리고 중앙정부의 수뇌는 三公의 합의제로 成한 의정부가 有하얏스나 明宗十五年 以來로 此는 유명무실하게 되고 문무의 重臣으로  成한 備邊司(備局又는 籌局)가 事實上의 最高機關이 되야 국가의 정무를 決하얏다. 如斯히 李朝의 중앙정부의 조직은 頗히 變態의 조직인 동시에 就中銓郞과 如한 者는 變態 중 더욱 變態의 狀을 呈하야 自然黨派를 釀成케 하얏스니 下에 論코저하는 沈義謙과 金孝元의 反目嫉視도 實은 이 銓郞에 관한 私怨에 기인한 者이다. 次에 近因은 第一 當時 士類間에 신구불화에 在하니 前日 乙巳士禍이후로 士類 간에도 자연 당파가 有함은 물론이어니와 宣祖初에 至하야는 新舊의 불화가 더욱 심하얏스니 此는 重言을 不要하고 當時 領相으로 在하던 東皐 李浚慶의 遺箚과 또 此를 反對하던 一事를 見하야도 其 情勢를 可窺할 것이다. 이 李浚慶은 尹元衡의 後를 繼한 領相으로 明宗의 顧命을 受하야 宣祖를 迎立하고 同王 四年까지 領相의 職에 在한 柱石의 重臣이엿다. 그는 領中樞府使로 宣祖 5年 7月에 卒逝할 때에 宣祖에게 이러한 遺箚을 上하엿다. 『今』＜3＞(이하 4쪽 누락-원문)＜4＞ 下附近)에 在하고 義謙의 家는 西部 貞陵洞(今貞洞)에 在한 故로 金에 가담한 者를 東人이라 하고 沈에 가담한 者를 西人이라 하야 東西朋黨의 명칭이 玆에 始하니 時는 宣祖 八年 乙亥인 故로 또한 乙亥朋黨이라 稱한다 (當時 大司諫 許曄은 前輩나 孝元을 推許함으로 東人의 領袖가 되고 右議政 朴淳은 淸名重望이 有하고 또 前輩인 故로 西人의 領袖가 되엿다.)
然而 宣祖 八年 東西分黨의 시기로부터 李朝末葉에 至하기까지 凡330여 년간의 黨爭은 직접 간접으로 정치상에 及한 影響이 多大함은 물론이고 그 분쟁의 경과도 또한 區區複雜하야 간단한 지면으로는 도저히 詳述하기 곤란하다. 그러나 나는 便利 上此를 六時期로 分하야 그 大槪를 論코자 한다.

2. 東人의 득세와 南北人 分派時期
此 時期는 宣祖 八年으로부터 光海君 十五年까지 至하는 約 50년간의 시기니 宣祖 八年 東西分黨의 際에 栗谷 李珥가 副提學으로 在하야 此를 극력 조정하다가 其效를 見치 못하고 一時 冠을 掛하더니 그후에 다시 入朝하야 大司諫으로 兵判 및 吏判의 重職에 臨하니 그는 비록 分黨의 조정자이나 그 門人이 西人인 故로 隱然히 西人을 助勢하게 되고 따러서 西人의 세력이 대확장하얏섯다. 그러나 宣祖 十七年에 栗谷이 病卒하고 其後를 承하야 李山海가 吏判이 되고 또 盧守愼은 領相 柳成龍은 禮判이 되니 此 三人은 다 東人의 쟁쟁한 者인 故로 東人의 勢力이 다시 강대하고 西人의 세력이 漸衰하더니 宣祖 二十二年에 西人으로 東人에 入한 鄭汝立이 謀反하다가 被誅하매 東人은 一時 大恐惶의 運을 遭하얏스나 東人은 원래 세력이 鞏固하야 容易難拔의 位에 至하얏다. 그후 宣祖 二十四年에 東人이 다시 分하야 南北兩派로 分하얏스니 此 分裂의 원인은 그 반대파되는 西人排斥에 대한 硬軟의 차별에 不外한 바 즉 硬派는 北人이요 軟派는 南人이다. 硬派의 領袖는 李潑로서 李山海가 此를 助하고 軟派의 領袖는 禹性傳으로서 柳成龍이 此를 右袒한 바 李의 家는 北岳山下에 在한 故로 其派를 北人이라 하고 禹性傳의 家는 南山麓에 在한 故로 그 派를 南人이라 指하얏스니 是가 즉 南人北人의 分派爭이다. 然而 壬亂을 際하야 南人領袖 柳成龍이 多年 정권을 執할 時에는 맛츰 국가 위급존망의 秋를 臨한 故로 別로 당쟁이 업섯스나 亂이 漸平하매 熄火가 再燃하야 北人 南以恭이 西崖의 主和한 것을 彈劾하야 官爵을 奪하게 되니 南人이 遂히 失脚하고 北人이 其代로 정권을 執하얏다(宣祖 말년기) 그러나 北人은 未久에 또 분쟁이 生하야 大北小北으로 分하고 大北은 또 中北肉 北骨北으로 分한바 宣祖 末年에는 小北領袖 柳永慶이 領相이 되야 其勢가 亦大하얏다.

大小北의 爭
大小北人의 爭은 黨人이 소위 祖宗의 名器를 玩弄物로 視한다는 好適例라 云하야도 可하니 此는 즉 宣祖의 세자 入承문제다. 초에 宣祖의 元妃 朴氏가 無嗣하고 또한 세자도 아즉 定치 못하엿섯는대 맛츰 壬亂이 起하야 宣祖가 播遷을＜5＞ 하게 되매 부득이 庶子 光海君으로 세자를 책봉하엿더니 그후 朴妃가 昇遐하고 金悌男의 女 仁穆大妃가 繼后가 되야 永昌大君 璣를 生하매 朝臣間에 세자 變冊문제가 突起하야 (明國과의 關係도 有하나 略함) 柳永慶의 小北一派는 大君을 擁立하랴하고 李爾瞻의 大北一派는 光海君을 擁護하야 玆에 대쟁론이 起 하얏다 然而 宣祖가 승하하고 光海君이 즉위하야 李爾瞻을 등용하매 (先是爾膽强請傳位, 被流配未及配所, 宣祖病篤召喚) 爾膽이 疑獄을 起하야 柳永慶 외, 國舅 金悌男 3子1壻를 皆殺하고 當時 僅히 8세인 永昌大君은 江華島 密室에서 煮殺하고 대군의 생모 仁穆大妃는 폐하야 西宮에 幽廢하고 그외 臨海君 珒과 定遠君 琈도 다 被害하니 此 慘變은 李朝 黨爭史上 一大 慘變이라 云치 안이치 못하겠다. 然而 此時 小北은 비록 廢母를 반대하얏스나 쟁론이 不一하야 또한 淸小北 濁小北으로 分하고 大北에게 여지업는 참패를 당하얏스니 此 光海君 一代의 間은 大北의 天下라 可謂하겟다.

3. 大北의 全滅과 西南人 抗爭時期
仁祖 원년으로부터 顯宗 15년까지 약 50년간은 大北의 전멸과 西人 및 南人의 항쟁시기라 可謂하겟스니 즉 光海君 15년 3월에 西人 李貴, 金自點, 金瑬, 李适 등이 반정의 旗를 擧하야 光海君을 폐하고 仁祖를 擁立하는 동시에 永昌, 臨海 양대군과 金悌男의 爵을 復하고 李爾瞻, 鄭仁弘 등 大北徒黨 수십인을 살해하고 또 그 派 1백인을 竄逐하니 此 시기는 大北의 전멸시기다. 然而 大北을 박멸하고 정권을 掌한 西人 中에 李貴, 金瑬 등은 功勳이 有함으로 功西 又는 勳西의 稱이 잇고 金尙憲은 재야당인 고로 淸西라 稱하야 또한 분열이 生하엿스니此는 尙者 南北人의 분열과 如히 반대당에 대한 硬軟의 차별이 有함에 불과함은 물론이요 又 在朝黨 즉 功西 중에도 老西少西 2파가 有하야 老西派는 南人과 妥協(金瑬 등 軟派)을 保持하랴하고 少西派는 此를 반대하얏스며(李貴 등 硬派) 그후 仁祖 말년에는 更히 분열하야 功西는 原黨, 洛黨(金自點일파)이 有하고 淸西는 山黨 漢黨이 生하얏스니 그중 山黨은 忠南 連山의 학자 金長生(沙溪)의 子 金集(愼獨齋)을 主로하야 連山 懷德의 士林을 다 망라한 바 沙溪의 門弟 宋浚吉
宋時烈 등이 또한 이 山黨에 叅하얏다. 如斯히 西人은 數多의 분파가 生하얏스나 仁祖一代의 間에는 勳西 일파가 牛耳를 執하얏다. 云치 안이치 못하겟고 또 孝宗時에 至하야는 洛黨 金自點이 被誅하고 北伐論者 宋時烈이 左議政이 되고 宋浚吉이 吏判됨을 따라 山黨의 세력이 또한 多大하엿다.

南人과 西人의 爭
然而玆에 一言을 안이치 못할 것은 南人의 지위니 남인은 柳成龍 이후로 정권을 執치 못하다가 仁祖反正 후에 梧里 李元翼이 비로소 領相이 되고 또 12의 南人이 요직에 在함으로 僅히 潛勢力을 保持할 뿐이엿다. 然而 顯宗朝에 至하야 西南人의 쟁론은 大히 주의할 바이나 卽 제1차는 顯宗 초년에 慈懿大妃(仁祖繼妃 趙氏)의 服할 孝宗喪期에＜6＞ 대하야 宋時烈 등은 朞年說을 主唱하고 南人 尹鐫(白湖) 許穆(眉叟) 등은 3년설을 주창하얏스며 제2차에는 顯宗 말년에 昇遐한 仁宣大妃(孝宗妃 張氏)의 喪에 대하야 宋은 大功說(9개월) 尹은 朞年說을 각자 주장하얏다. 如斯히 양론의 분쟁이 심하다가 顯宗은 尹說을 채용하니 결국 西人의 勢가 축소되고 南人의 勢가 대두돠야 同王 末年에는 南人 許積이 領相이 되고  繼하야 肅宗 초에는 南人 權大運
許穆이 左右相이 되니 그 세력이 益益旺盛하야 宋時烈을 크게 攻擊함으로 一時堂堂의 세력이 有하던 宋時烈도 그만 관작을 피탈하고 長鬐郡으로 유배되는 비운에 陷하고 又 당시 南人중에는 西人에 대한 태도의 硬軟에 의하야 又 淸南(許積) 濁南(權大運)의 양파가 生하얏다.
이상과 如히 당파의 성쇠는 一仆一起하야 頗히 복잡하얏스나 摠而言之하면 宣祖 8년의 분당으로 顯宗말년까지 약 1백년간에 최초 50년은 東人이 득세하고 후 50년은 西人이 牛耳를 執하얏다.

4. 南人失脚과 老少分爭 時期
此 당쟁은 肅宗 원년으로부터 同 29년까지 至하는 약 20년간의 당쟁이니 초에 南人의 領袖 許積이 顯宗의 顧命을 受하야 肅宗을 보필하던 바 당시 肅宗은 僅히 14세의 弱齡으로 질병이 多하고 且 宗室 중 反軌者가 多함으로 許積의 庶子 許堅이 此等과 결탁하야 반정을 謀하다가(麟坪大君의 子 福昌君 楨 福善君 柟과 同謀) 兵判 金錫胄의 摘發로 因하야 許積의 부자 및 尹鐫 외 수십이 被誅하고 南人 1백여 인이 다 被斥하니 他가 즉 肅宗 6년 庚申大獄이다. 如斯히 南人이 일망타진된 후 金錫冑
金益勳(金長生孫)은 그 功을 錄하게 되야 益勳은 御營大將 金壽恒은 領相 閔鼎重은 左相 金錫冑는 右相이 되고 又 宋時烈은 다시 소환되야 朝에 入하니 명망이 일세를 傾하고 따라서 西人의 세력이 大振하얏다. 그러나 西人中 少壯者는 金錫冑의 행사를 반대하는 자가 多하야 遂히 老少 2파로 또 분열되엿스니 즉 金錫冑 金益勳을 右하는 자는 老論이요. 此물 반대하는 韓泰東
趙持謙 등 1파는 소위 少論인 바 肅宗 9년에는 다시 禮論문제로 宋時烈과 尹拯(明齋) 朴世釆 간에 쟁론이 起하야 宋은 老論과 一派가 되고 尹은 少論과 一派가 되야 유명한 懷尼(즉 懷德과 尼山魯城)의 戰을 成한 후로 老少의 분쟁이 益益熾烈하게 되엿다(肅宗 9년— 宋時烈이 孝宗의 世室문제와 太祖의 威化島回軍 近 2백년 紀念上謚문제를 건의하얏다가 尹拯이 반대하야 遂히 老少爭論이 激起하얏다.) 그후 肅宗 15년에는 세자 책봉문제로 南人과 西人간에 대충돌이 生튕�야 南人의 睦來善, 金德遠, 閔黯 등이 樞要의 지위를 得하고(金, 睦爲 左右相) 西人의 宋時烈은 南人 李玄紀
南致勳
尹彬 등의 上䟽에 因하야 83세의 노령으로 濟州에 유배되엿다가 井邑에 移하야 賜死하고 吳道一, 洪致祥, 金益勳 등은 或罷 或竄하며 金壽恒도 또 賜死하얏스니 此가 즉 소위 己已換局이다.(초에 肅宗 正妃 閔氏가 嗣子가 無하고 熙嬪 張氏가 王子 均(즉 景宗)을 生하얏는데 肅宗이 正妃 閔氏를 폐하고 왕자 均으로 세자를 책봉코자＜7＞ 하얏더니 西人 宋時烈은 반대하고 南人 睦來善 등은 찬성하야 쟁론이 又起함) 그러나 肅宗 20년 4월에 至하야 왕은 다시 前非를 후회하고 南人을 踈待하니 西人이 此機를 乘하야 南人의 在官者를 黜斥하고 南九萬이 領相이 되야 재차 西人의 내각을 회복하고 宋時烈도 또한 復爵되얏다.

5. 老少 大衝突의 時期
肅宗 20년에 南人이 失勢하고 정권이 西人에 귀한 후 국면은 다시 일변하야 老少양당의 쟁론이 되얏스니 肅宗 20년으로부터 景宗 4년가지 약 30년간은 노소대충돌의 전성시기라 可謂하겟다. 景宗은 병약하야 왕자를 탄생할 희망이 無하고 또한 聽政하기 不能함으로 원년 8월에 老論派에서 世弟 英宗으로 代理聽政케할 事를 䟽請하야 領相 金昌集, 領府事 李頣命, 判府事 趙泰釆, 李健命 등(소위 老論 四大臣)의 노론 巨首가 다 此를 찬동하얏더니 趙泰耈 등 少論의 격렬한 반대로 老論이 遂히 敗北하고 四大臣외 그 一派가 다 竄逐을 당하고 趙泰耈 등 少論一派가 득세하야 泰耈은 領相 崔奎瑞, 崔錫恒은 左右相이 되니 정국은 다시 少論의 천하가 되엿다. 然而 少論 중 急激派 金一鏡(承旨)의 徒는 宦者 朴尙儉, 文有道, 宮婢 石烈, 必貞 등과 음모하고 東宮을 해코가 하다가 발각되야 朴文輩가 다 被誅되고 其 翌年에는 一鏡이 또 睦虎龍과 음모하고 老論一派가 東宮을 음해한다 誣告하야 金昌集 등 四大臣외 數십이 被誅하고 白望, 鄭麟重, 金龍澤, 李天紀 등도 또한 被罪하니 此가 즉 辛壬誣獄이다.(辛丑, 壬寅양년을 亘한 고로 辛壬이라 하고 又혹은 壬寅獄事라고도 한다.)

6. 老論의 登用과 調和主義의 實行時期
英宗 원년으로부터 正宗 24년까지의 약 80년간은 소위 老少論 調和主義의 實行時期다. 세인이 皆知하는 바와 如히 英宗과 正宗은 李朝 말기의 英主로서 英宗은 즉위 초에 蕩平의 敎諭를 下하야 內外臣民에 示하고 당쟁의 弊禍를 通切히 論하야 老少調和主義를 取하얏다. 즉위 초에는 老論派가 要路에 當하얏스나 壬寅誣獄의 진상이 탄로됨애 金一鏡, 睦虎龍 등을 誅하고 柳鳳輝, 李光佐, 趙泰憶 등 少論一派를 竄逐하며 壬寅冤獄에 관계된 諸人의 官을 復하고 또 金一鏡의 餘黨 李麟佐의 亂을 平하니 一時宮內에 少論派의 形影이 絶하고 老論이 다시 등용되엿다. 그러나 調和主義를 실행코자 하는 英宗은 一黨에게 영구히 정권을 委함이 不可함을 아는 고로 老論 洪致中으로 領相을 삼는 동시에 少論 趙文命으로 右相을 삼고 3백년래 당쟁의 一原因이 되던 銓郞의 規制를 폐지하고 또 老論 宋時烈과 少論 朴世釆를 동시 文廟에 從祀케 하니 이것도 蕩平主義의 한 실현이다. 그후를 繼하야 正宗은 또한 궁중 침실에 題하되 『蕩蕩平平室』이라 하고 常히 蕩平主義에 노력하니 前日에 격렬하던 당쟁은 점차 浸息에 至하얏다.＜8＞

7. 老論의 全盛과 黨派打破時期
英正 이후에 당쟁은 대개 완화되엿스나 老論의 세력이 의연히 강대한 중 純, 憲, 哲 諸시대에 至하야는 외척의 老論이 정권을 좌우하니 비록 전일과 如한 慘劇은 見치 안엇스나 他派가 정사를 간여치 못하야 李太王 초년까지는 恰然히 老論의 天下와 如한 感이 잇섯다가 大院君이 攝政한 후로 一大勇刀를 下하야 四色을 타파하고 공평이 등용하며 또 당파 이외의 人도 역시 채용하게 되니 수백년간의 당쟁은 遂히 종막을 고하게 되엿다. 그러나 合倂時期까지도 의연히 老論이 有勢한 것은 사실이니 彼所謂 76인의 귀족 중에 少論이 僅히 70北人이 1인이고 그 외는 거의 老論인 것을 見하야도 可知할 것이다.

8. 黨爭의 社會上에 及한 影響
각 시기의 당쟁이 정치에 여하한 악영향을 與한 것은 상술함과 갓거니와 사회상에 及한 영향도 또한 多大하니 玆에 略論하면
1. 일반인심에 及한 영향
당쟁이 일반인심에 악영향을 與함은 물론인 바 그 중 현저한 事는 제1 사회 각계급을 互相離背케 하야 今日 일반조선인의 단합심의 결핍을 馴致하고 제2 白己黨派를 옹호함에만 열중한 고로 인물의 선악, 忠逆의 표준 여하를 失하고 제3 倫常을 파멸하얏스며(例如兄弟叔侄이 異色으로 分한 것)
2. 學術上에 及한 影響
당쟁은 결국 老少의 승리로 歸한 중 老論은 少論보다 항상 세력이 多하야 學織의 여하와 인물 여하를 불구하고 顯職을 取함이 拾芥와 如히 용이하얏스나 南人 北人은 일차 실각한 후로 다시 정계에 세력이 無함으로 白然 他方面으로 傾注하얏스니 就中 南人은 시문, 書法이외에 정치 경제의 학술연구에 전력하는 자가 多하야 柳馨源의 磻溪隨錄, 李瀷의 星湖僿說, 丁若鏞의 牧民心書, 李重煥의 八域志 기타 諸 학자의 名著가 有하게 되고 또 白由派의 문인학자가 배출한 결과로 당시 배척하던 불교 도교 등을 自由硏究하게 되엿스니 그 중 천주교가 南人의 手를 經하야 수입되고 또 朝鮮에서 신흥한 東學이 이 南人의 계통에서 起한 것은 大히 주목할 일이다. (天道敎祖 崔水雲도 남인파) 此는 究竟 儒學이 전혀 노론의 독점이 되고 仕寰의 진로가 老論이외에는 殆히 閉塞된 결과이다.
3. 婚姻에 及한 影響
同一한 양반이라도 同色이 안이면 결혼치 안은 것은 상례이엿고 또 따라서 부득이 異色과 한다하면 맛치 班常이 相婚한 것이나 嫡庶가 相婚한 것과 가티 思하야 日謀家는 落婚을 하얏느니 失色을 하엿느니 하고 互相排斥하엿다. 此風은 今에도 아즉까지 殘存하야 古老간에는 異色婚을 배척하는 風이 種種 잇다.＜9＞

9. 各 黨派의 特色과 其 地方的 分布
남인 南夏正의 著한 桐巢漫錄에 의하면 四色은 각각 특색이 잇스니 즉 老論은 剛厲가 多하고 少論은 진실이 少하고 小北은 色態를 好하고 東人(南人을 指함)은 柔善하고도 痴함과 如하나 東土의 본색을 失치 안이한다 하얏다. 이것이 과연 적합할지 不如하거니와 四色은 예절 혼인 기타 생활의 환경이 各異한 까닭에 언어 행동 성격 등도 相異할 것은 사실이다. 그리고 甲午 이전까지는 당파의 지방적 근거지도 各異하얏스니 즉 京城은 원래 수도인 까닭에 四色이 皆聚하얏고 慶尙道는 士林의 淵藪인 동시에 李退溪를 宗으로 한 柳西厓(成龍)가 남인 거두로 安東에 잇는 까닭에 安東 禮安을 중심으로 하야 慶尙一帶가 殆히 南人의 鄕과 如한 感이 잇고 忠淸道는 栗谷의 門人 西人 金長生이 連山에 잇섯고 그 학파 宋時烈, 宋浚吉이 懷德에 잇섯슴으로 連山 懷德 太田 一帶는 그 子孫 및 門徒의 西人이 만코 論山(舊 魯城)은 尹明齋의 本鄕인 고로 그 부근에 少論이 多하고 京畿 江原은 老少南人이 互居하고 黃海道 海州 일대는 李栗谷의 자손과 그 파의 서인이 다소 잇섯다. 그리고 咸平 兩道는 과거에 양반이 희소함으로 四‰²이 또한 別無하고 全羅道는 李朝 中葉 이래로 대관이 別無하고 土大夫家가 少함으로 鄭松江, 金河西, 奇高峰 등 4인 幾家 외에는 별로 이럿타할 집이 업섯다.(此는 남인 李重煥의 著한 八域志를 근거)＜10＞
