기사형태	문예기타 (Literature Etc.)

Is my husband really a husband?
Husband of my older brother
Sleep here and eat before you go
Have some newly made songpyeon (松篇, half-moon rice cakes)

Should you sleep here or should you eat and go?
Should you eat the new songpyeon and go?
Wife and man's family, watch your eyes

Mother, Mother, I raised a daughter
Don't give her to the Samhwa family (三和家庭)
They sprinkle water and put on new shoes
She won't be able to handle the hardships of married life
I hate eating barley rice like sand
And salted radish greens (거이) for side dishes
I secretly sleep with a patchwork blanket
And hold onto the spindle tip (지말이)
—The spindle tip is the hand part of the spinning wheel—

My father-in-law's writing is good
Why doesn't he write a single letter?
My sister-in-law's skill is good
But she doesn't even have a needle case

Cousin, Cousin
How is married life?
A dozen measures of half-washed skirt
Are all wet with tears
A ten-nyang (ten-ounce) silver ring
Is all melted away with snot

The sun is setting, the sun is setting
The sun is setting on Ilwol Peak (日月峯)
The setting sun on Ilwol Peak
Receive it on a brass tray
Today's sun is doing a child's duty (동자데)
Who will go to do that duty?
No matter how young a maiden is
They cannot draw water in the Okdang Spring (玉堂春)
They cannot cook rice in the Salmun field
On the ploughing field of Mt. Apnam (압남산)
—Beating cloth—
Beat the three-piece skirt
Even if you can't wear half-washed clothes
Beat it until it’s worn out

In the third watch of the month under the bright moon
A lone wild goose flies by
Under the clear blue sky, a wild goose
Cries alone, where is it going?
Tonight is already late
The bachelor from the village (세도령) will come
The spinning wheel that her father made
Why doesn't it turn properly?

龍岡民謠
◇
아주밧니 아주밧니
형의남편 아주밧니
자고가소 묵어가소
올베송편 잡숫구가소
자고갈지 묵어갈지
올베송편 먹고갈지
妻男의댁 네눈치보소

◇
엄마엄마 길럿다
삼화가정(三和家庭)주지마라
물바르고 새발라서
시집사리 못할데라
모래가튼 보리밥에
거이반찬 먹기실타
몰래돌은 베구자고
지말이는 쥐고잔다
―지말이는 물래의 손잽이―

◇
올애비는 글자가좃태도
편지한장을 왜안이하나
누의이은 재질이좃태도
쌈지하나이 다업대데

◇
사촌형님 사촌형님
시집사리 엇덧습듸가＜2＞
열새미명 반물치마
눈물짓기에 다처젓네
열냥리 은가락지
콧물싯기에 다녹아젓네

◇
해저간다 해저간다
일월봉(日月峯)에해저간다
일월봉에 지는해는
놋쟁반에 바드시오
오날해도 동자데
동자하러 누가갈고
아모리 아가씨신들
옥당춘에 물못길으리
살문팟에 밥못하리
압남산에 쟁기에
―다듬이들―
다듬아라 세베치마
한물반물 못입어도
아지게 다듬아라

◇
월사삼경 밝은달에
외기력이 올며간다
백일청천 기럭이
혼자울고 어듸가나
오늘밤도 밤드젓다
세도령 올로다
지아버지 민문래
왜죽빗죽 안돌아간다＜3＞
＜2-3＞
