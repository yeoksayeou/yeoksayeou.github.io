New Year's Laughter Festival

Settling Accounts

Single S

Ahem! Ladies and gentlemen, please don't laugh. If you start laughing just by looking at my forehead, things will get out of hand. In some deep rural village in Japan, there was a place where they didn't know what a toilet (便所) was. Since there were no toilets, it wasn't that they didn't relieve themselves, but when they needed to go, not only were there no toilets, but they didn't even know the word for toilet. So, they would lie on a wide wooden plank and go to the stream, letting it flow away in the water. The fellows called that (relieving themselves) "settling accounts," and the wooden plank was called a "settling accounts board (셈치르는판)."

Now, a certain township head (面長) living in that peculiar village came to Seoul for sightseeing and suddenly needed to settle accounts on the street, causing a commotion. He was in such a hurry that he felt like he was about to burst, so he dashed into a random inn on the street. The inn's maid led him to a room on the second floor, but without any regard for appearances, he rushed in ahead of the maid and, without even taking off his hat, urgently said:
<blank line>
Head: "I need to ask you something urgently... it's very urgent."

Maid: "Yes, what is it?"

Head: "It's nothing much, but I need to settle an account."

The maid didn't realize he urgently needed to relieve himself and thought he meant settling the inn's bill.
<blank line>
Maid: "Goodness, you settle the account when you leave."

Head: "Heavens... that's a big problem... I'm staying for several days. Do you mean I should hold the account until then? I've been holding it since the road and dashed here. How can I wait until I leave? Please let me settle it now."

Maid: "No matter who you are or how many days you stay, you settle it when you leave. Please settle it when you leave."

Head: "Heavens, you don't understand my situation. How can you tell someone who's in such a hurry to settle an account to wait until they leave? Where is that written? Goodness, I'm about to die. Please go down and bring it to me quickly."

He was about to burst, so he hunched over and, grunting, shouted. However, she didn't realize he meant to bring the wooden plank, thinking he meant to bring the bill (計算書) for settling the account. The maid went down to the owner's room on the first floor and came back empty-handed... The township head, unable to maintain his dignity, was in such a hurry that he held his buttocks with both hands and was hopping around in the room. When he saw the maid's face, he was so happy that he dashed towards her in one breath.
<blank line>
Head: "Why didn't you bring it sooner... I almost had a big accident... Give it to me quickly."

Maid: "I didn't bring it. I went down and told the owner, but even the owner said that you want to settle the account now, but how can you settle it without knowing the amount?"

Head: "Oh dear, how can you know the amount before settling it? What's the point of knowing the amount beforehand? Don't kill me, let me settle it quickly."

Maid: "Well, how can you settle the account beforehand?"

Head: "Are you really trying to kill me? You can see how much it is after settling it... Where is the place to settle accounts in this house? I'll go down and settle it."

Maid: "The place to settle accounts is right under the stairs on the first floor, next to the door."

And she pointed to the room where the owner was sitting on the first floor. So, the township head, feeling as if he had been resurrected, dashed down, planning to relieve himself in one go. When he went down, the owner was sitting in his room, so he assumed that the man was relieving himself, facing away.
<blank line>
Head: "Haha, big trouble... Excuse me, please hurry up and come out. I've been holding it in since earlier."

Owner: "What's wrong? Why are you telling me to come out?"

Head: "Why? You're the only one settling accounts while others are in a hurry?"

Owner: "What do you mean by settling accounts?"

Head: "Is this person trying to kill someone? Hurry up and come out so I can settle my account too."

Owner: "Oh, oh, you want to settle the account? As I told the maid earlier, you settle the account when you leave."

Head: "You're saying that again. What are you doing anyway?"
<60>
Owner: "I'm the owner, so I'm sitting here settling accounts all day."

Head: "Goodness, what do you eat to be settling accounts for so long? Once you've settled it enough, let me settle mine. I'm really dying."

Owner: "No, I can only settle accounts when I sit here."

Head: "Haha, big trouble. Then lend me the settling accounts board."

He was asking for the wooden plank to relieve himself, but the owner, hearing "settling accounts board," thought he meant the abacus (數板) and handed him the abacus.
<blank line>
Head: "Oh, no, do you settle accounts with this? This is only for children's accounts. How can you settle an adult's account with this?"

Owner: "Oh, no, not at all. Not only children but also adults settle accounts with it."

Head: "No, it won't do. Others might have small accounts, so they can settle them with this, but I can't. What if the account overflows? Get me a bigger one."

The owner, hearing that the account was overflowing, thought he meant that the calculation was too large and the abacus beads were not enough. Thinking about how much money he was trying to calculate, he handed him a larger abacus.
<blank line>
Head: "Haha, this will be enough to settle it. But where should I settle it?"

Owner: "Anywhere you think is good. You can just settle it there."

Head: "Settle the account here in front of people? Especially since those people are eating over there. How can I settle the account here? I need to settle it quietly in a quiet place."

Owner: "That's right. In a place with many people, it's easy to get confused and settle the account incorrectly. Why don't you go and settle it in that room on the second floor?"

Head: "Then I'll settle it and come back!"

And he happily dashed upstairs.

After a while, the old man covered the account he had settled on the abacus board with paper, carefully carrying it and cautiously coming down.
<blank line>
Head: "Eh, eh, I barely managed to settle it comfortably. Please throw it in the stream."

He handed it over, and the stench was overwhelming.

Owner: "You said you were settling accounts, what are you doing? You're doing all sorts of things."

Head: "I settled the account. What other things did I do?"

And he kicked the abacus board with his toe. Because it was an upside-down abacus board, it rolled away. The old township head tilted his head and said, "Haha, Seoul is different! Even the settling accounts board has wheels so it rolls by itself!"

Korean-Made Keystone

Paek Hak-su

It was a long time ago when there was only one movie theater, Umi-gwan.

Today is the day when a famous and very popular silent film is being shown.

Regardless of first, second, or third class, it's a huge success with every seat filled, with no room for discounts even worth one pun.

In the very back of the third class, due to a certain reason, a pair of Korean-made keystone "wooden shoes (n 막신)," also famous no less than the silent film currently showing, are standing.

On the screen, "Noro" is out, hitting this way and that way, and the tension is high, so the audience isn't even coughing loudly, holding their breath, and focusing all their attention there.

It's at this moment. At this moment, a head wearing a hat suddenly rises in front of the "wooden shoes," blocking their view. Blocking someone's view during such an interesting part is no small infringement of rights.
<blank line>
The "wooden shoes" leaned towards the ear of the hat-wearer and quietly tried to negotiate.

"Hey friend, please take off your hat."

If he just took off his hat, it wouldn't be much of a hindrance, so they tried to negotiate like this.

However, the hat-wearer probably didn't have the leeway to think that he was blocking someone's view, and instead, he probably thought that he was disturbing the person who was engrossed in Seo Sang-ho's commentary (西相호). So, feeling displeased, he pretended not to hear and just stood there.

The "wooden shoes" whispered another word into the hat-wearer's ear.

"Hey friend! Please take off your hat."

But he still doesn't take it off. The "wooden shoes" whispered again. Still doesn't take it off. As things have come to this, the "wooden shoes" have no choice but to take some measures to "protect their vested rights." So, he whispers again into the hat-wearer's ear...
<blank line>
"You bastard, why won't you take off your hat when I tell you to? Did you come out wearing it from your mom's belly? You damn son of a bitch!"

With such abusive language, the hat-wearer can't feel comfortable.

"What? What kind of bastard are you! What, you bastard!"

As the hat-wearer shouted angrily like this, abusive language erupted from the audience, who were engrossed in the screen and Seo Sang-ho's commentary.

"You bastard!"

"Don't make noise!"

(Continued on page 39)
<61>
(Continued from page 61)

"Drag him out!"

"Feed him shit!"

As things have come to this, the hat-wearer's nose is completely flattened. He can't even make a peep anymore, but out of spite, he still doesn't take off his hat.

The "wooden shoes" lean towards the hat-wearer's ear and whisper again.

"See, you bastard, you thought you could endure it for a hundred days without taking it off? You bastard, why is such a strong guy not taking off his hat and holding out?"

The hat guy shouts again. Then the problematic character, the "wooden shoes," stands there indifferently, and only curses rain down from the audience.

After repeating this about three times, there was a ten-minute intermission. When the lights are turned on brightly, the hat-wearer turns to the "wooden shoes" to vent his anger and scolds.
<blank line>
"You bastard, why, why are you acting crazy! Acting crazy!"

He threatens to hit him, about to rush in to punch him. But the "wooden shoes" just stand there as if a neighborhood dog is barking. In the meantime, the audience has discovered the culprit who was making noise earlier.

So, they shout and stand up.

"Drag that bastard out!"

"Pull him out!"

"Why is that bastard making noise by himself! He's a madman, pull him out!"

If left alone, the hat-wearer seems like he'll be trampled to death by the crowd.

As the situation becomes uneasy, a policeman who was present comes and pulls the hat-wearer out. The "wooden shoes" finally say one word, "Damn bastard!" and continue to stand there indifferently. <47>

朝鮮製키―톤
白鶴洙

활동사진관으로는 우미관하나밧게엄든 좀 녯날이야기다.
오늘은 유명하고도  유명한명금사진이 갈린날이다.
일등ㆍ이등ㆍ삼등 어느칭을 물론하고 만원이되야 한푼어치 에누리엄시 립추의여지가엄는 대성황이다.
삼등 맨 뒤에는 레에의하야 지금 상영되어잇는 명금사진에 지지아니하게 유명한 조선제(朝鮮製)키―톤「나막신」이 한 레에의하야 나막신을 신고 서서잇다.
스크린에는 지금「노로」가 나와이리치고 저리치고 한참 긴장이되야 관중들은 기침하나 크게하지아니하고 숨소리조차 죽여가며 왼정신을 그곳에두고 잇는판이다.
이다. 이에 웬 모자쓴 대가리하나가「나막신」압헤서 쑥―일어나더니 나막신의 시선을 가로막는다. 지금한참 재미잇는이판에 남의압흘 가로막으니 궐리침해하고는 적지아니한침해다.
「나막신」은 그 모자쟁이의 귀에대이고 조용히 교섭을하여보앗다.
「여보이친구 모자좀 벗구려」
모자만버스면 그다지 방해는 되지아니하겟슴으로 이러케 교섬한 것이다.
그러나 모자쟁이로보면 자긔가남의시선을 가로막엇다는 것은 채생각할여유도엄고 도리어 저편에서 지금한참 서상호의 해설에 정신이 팔녀잇는 것을 방해한줄로「인정」을하게되엿슬 것이다. 그리하야 아니운생각이들엇든지 못들은체하고 그냥서서잇다.
나막신은 한마듸 모자쟁이의 귀에다 속살거렷다.
「여보이친구! 모자좀버서요」
그래도 아니벗는다 나막신은 속살거렷다 그래도 아니벗는다. 일이 이러케됨에 「긔득권의 옹호」를위하야 나막신은 어한수단을 취하지아니할수가엄다 그리하야 그는다시 모자쟁ㅣ 귀에다 속살거리기를…….
「이자식아 왜 모자는 버스라니 아니버서? 너멈 배쏙에서 나올 쓰고나온거냐? 망할자식가트니라고!」
이러케막욕질이 나옴에 모자쟁이의 배알이 편할수가엄다.
「이자식이 어놈자식이야! 무어야 이자식아!」
모자쟁이가 성난김에 이러케 소리를 버럭질으자 지금 스린과 서상호의 해설에 한참 긴장이 되어잇든관중으로부터는 막욕이 터저나왓다.
「이자식아」
「들지말아」
(三九頁에게속)＜61＞
(六一頁에게속)
「집어내라」
「×멕여라」
일이 이러케됨에 모자쟁이의 코가 아주 납작이다 다시는 소리도 못하고 그러나 심술에 모자는여전히 아니벗는다.
나막신은 모자쟁이의 귀에대이고  속살거린다.
「거바라이자식아 네가아니벗고 견데백일줄아니? 이자식아 왜그장한놈이 모자는 아니벗고 버틔는거야」
모자군은  소리를 질은다. 그러면 문제인물 나막신은 시침이를 고섯고 관중으로부터 욕만비오듯한다.
이러케하기를 세 번가량 되푸리한뒤에 십분휴식이되엇다. 불이 환히켜짐애 모자쟁이는 분푸리를하랴고 나막신에게로 도라서서 진다.
「이자식 왜 왜 지질이야! 지랄이」
달녀들어 한 대 릴기세로 어튼다. 그러나 나막신은 동리ㅅ개가짓나하는 듯이 아모대ㅅ구도 아니하고 그냥서서잇다. 그통에 관중들은 악가 들든범인을 발견하엿다.
그리하야 왁― 들고일어선다.
「저자식 집어치어러」
「어내라」
「그자식이 왜 혼자서 드니! 밋친놈이다 어내라」
그대로두면 모자쟁이가 군중에게 밟혀죽을하다.
형세가 불온함에 림석하엿든 순사가와서 모자쟁이를 어내고 말엇다. 나막신은 비로소 한마듸「망할자식!」하고는 여전히 시침이를 서서잇다.＜47＞
