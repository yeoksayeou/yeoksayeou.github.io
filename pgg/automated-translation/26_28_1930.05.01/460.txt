The Inside Story of the Injo Coup
						Cha Sang-chan

The Joseon political situation at the time of King Gwanghae's ascension

On the night of March 13th, the 15th year of Gwanghae. What happened 307 years ago on April 10th in the solar calendar, the so-called Injo Coup, was on the surface no different from when Seong Hui-an (成希顔), Park Won-jong (朴元宗), and others ousted the tyrannical Yeonsangun and enthroned Jungjong in the Yeonsanjo era under the banner of rescuing the Jongsa (宗社, royal ancestral shrines). However, upon closer examination, it was quite different. The so-called coup for the sake of the Jongsa was in reality a power struggle by the Seoin faction (西人) who had lost power at the time, overthrowing the Gwanghaejo government of the Daebuk faction (大北派) and establishing their own government. Now, to explain the details of this, it is necessary to first briefly revisit the political situation at the time of King Gwanghae's ascension.

King Gwanghae, as everyone knows, was the second son of King Seonjo. Initially, Seonjo had no legitimate son and had 12 illegitimate sons including Imhae-gun (臨海君). The eldest son, Imhae-gun*, was known for his violent behavior and lost public support. Gwanghae-gun was relatively popular, and during the Imjin War (壬辰兵亂) when Seonjo was forced to flee to Uiju, Seonjo appointed Gwanghae-gun as Crown Prince and entrusted him with the important task of managing the army and overseeing the country. <167>

As such, I will now discuss the major ones. Regarding domestic affairs, the first priority was the reconstruction of Seoul. During the Imjin War, all the palaces and general market buildings in Seoul were burned down, leaving only scorched earth. During Seonjo's reign, immediately after the war, he could not dare to begin reconstruction work. When Gwanghae ascended the throne, he overcame numerous difficulties and devoted himself to rebuilding the capital. Immediately upon his ascension (戌申 year), he rebuilt Jongmyo Shrine (宗廟), and in the following year, Giyu (己酉 year), he rebuilt Changdeok Palace (昌德宮) and moved his residence there. (From after the Imjin War until then, he had temporarily used the old residence of Prince Wolsan (月山大君) - present-day Deoksu Palace - as his royal residence.) In the following year, Gyeongseul (庚戌 year, the 2nd year of Gwanghae's reign), he rebuilt the Four Schools (東西南北四學), and in the 6th year, Gapin (甲寅 year), he newly built Gimyeonggak (欽敬閣) in Changdeok Palace. In the 7th year, Eulmyo (乙卯 year), he repaired Changdeok Palace, and in the 8th year, Byeongjin (丙辰 year), he also newly built Ingyeong Palace (仁慶宮) and Gyeongdeok Palace (慶德宮) (the palace inside Yeongseong Gate - present-day Ilgyeong Middle School site). Regarding education, as mentioned above, he rebuilt the Four Schools to focus on national education, and at the same time, in the first year, Giyu (己酉 year), he established the examination system (重試, 對策, 別試) (i.e., the civil service examination system) to appoint talented people. Regarding military education, in the 11th year, Gimyo (己末 year), he newly established the Mangwankwa (萬人科) to select 10,000 warriors. Next, regarding diplomacy, in the first year, Giyu (己酉 year), Ryukyu offered tribute and requested brotherly harmony, which was permitted. He opened a market in Busan Port for the first time and engaged in trade with the Japanese. In the 9th year, Jeongsa (丁巳 year), he dispatched a Tongsinsa (通信史, diplomatic envoy) to Japan to improve relations. In the 11th year, Gimyo (己末 year), he sent troops to the Ming Dynasty to assist in subjugating the Qing Dynasty (the so-called Simha Campaign (深河役)). In the 12th year, Gyeongsin (庚申 year), fearing the Qing's invasion of the national border, he negotiated with the Ming Dynasty and received assistance from Ming troops in defending the Joseon border. In the 14th year, Imsul (壬戌 year), seeing the growing power of the newly emerging Qing Dynasty, he sent a secret envoy (avoiding Ming) to improve relations and at the same time encouraged Pyongyang Governor Park Yeop (朴曄) not to neglect border defenses.

King Gwanghae's Misgovernment

However, as a result of large-scale construction projects for many years immediately after the war, the people were extremely exhausted, and complaints arose from all directions. The national treasury <169> became depleted, and in the 9th year, Jeongsa (丁巳 year), he was forced to publicly implement the sale of official positions and the payment of money for continued publication of books. Bribery became rampant in the palace and government, official discipline became even more disordered, and the legal system was greatly relaxed. In the palace, Kim Sang-gung (金尙宮) (whose name was Gaettong-i (개똥이)), Lee Sang-gung (李尙宮), and the concubines Suk-ui Yun (淑儀尹), Suk-ui Heo (淑儀許), Suk-ui Hong (淑儀洪), Suk-ui Gwon (淑儀權), etc., abused their power based on the king's favor. In the government, Park Seung-jong (朴承宗) and Ryu Hui-bun (柳希奮) (King Gwanghae's queen's brother) of the Sobuk faction (小北派) and Lee I-cheom (李爾瞻) and Jeong In-hong (鄭仁弘) of the Daebuk faction (大北) slandered each other, causing numerous wrongful imprisonments. Among them, I will give a few important examples:

First, the death by royal decree of Imhae-gun. Imhae-gun was born to Gongbin Kim-ssi (恭嬪金氏) and was King Gwanghae's half-brother from the same mother. Because of his naturally reckless behavior, Seonjo appointed Gwanghae-gun as Crown Prince. After Seonjo passed away and Gwanghae ascended the throne, he requested investiture from the Ming Dynasty (at that time, due to the relationship of suzerainty with the Ming Dynasty, there was a precedent of receiving the investiture formality whenever succeeding to the throne). The Ming Dynasty insisted on the impropriety of deposing the eldest and enthroning the younger, and dispatched Liaodong Dusa (遼東都司) Eom Il-gwae (嚴一塊) to Joseon (in reality, Eom's agent Man Mou (萬某) came) to investigate Imhae-gun's illness (the reason for requesting Gwanghae's investiture was that Imhae-gun had a chronic illness and was unable to handle state affairs). The court summoned Imhae-gun from Gyodong Shelter (喬桐謫所) to the Seogang (西江) and actually showed his illness (previously, Imhae-gun was exiled to Jin-do (珎島) on suspicion of plotting an unlawful conspiracy, and then moved to Gyodong). Chief State Councilor Yi Deok-hyeong (李德馨) and Minister of Taxation Hwang Sin (黃愼) were sent as envoys to the Ming Dynasty and barely resolved the issue. However, Chief Censor-General Jeong In-hong and Grand Scholar Lee I-cheom argued that it was best to fundamentally remove Imhae-gun to eliminate the root of the problem. Despite the opposition of Chief State Councilor Yi Won-ik (李元翼) (O-ri (梧里)) and Left State Councilor Yi Hang-bok (李恒福) (Baeksa (白沙)), the king followed Jeong In-hong's words and ordered his death by royal decree. Second, in the 4th year of Gwanghae's reign, the wrongful imprisonment in the poetry case of Gwon Seok-ju (權石洲) and Han (韓). Han was the second son of Gwon Byeok (權擘) of the Namin faction (南人派). He was known for his upright and unrestrained character and outstanding poetic talent, and his fame swept the era. At that time, King Gwanghae's brother-in-law, Ryu Hui-bun, was serving as Minister of War and monopolized state power. Seoam (踈菴) Im Suk-yeong (任叔英) criticized this and was dismissed. As a result, Gwon wrote a poem satirizing the situation: "The palace willows are green, and orioles sing in disorder, / The city's officials celebrate the joyful peace. / Who sends forth dangerous words from a commoner's garment?" (宮柳靑靑鶯亂啼, 滿城冠盖媚春暉. 朝廷共賀昇平樂, 誰遣危言出布衣.) (The palace willow refers to Ryu Hui-bun, and the commoner's garment refers to Im Suk-yeong.) Ryu Hui-bun resented this and falsely accused Gwon to Gwanghae, even conducting a personal interrogation, and ordered him to be reduced from death to exile. However, he was again ordered to be executed along the way (Gwon stayed overnight outside Dongdaemun (東大門) on his way to his place of exile, and upon seeing the sentence "I urge you, drink another cup of wine, the wine does not reach the soil on Liu Ling's grave!" (權君 「原文은 勸君」 更進一盃酒, 酒不到劉伶墳上土!) written on the wall of the inn, he was unhappy. Not long after, he was executed, and people called it a prophecy.). His brother Tao (韜) was also sentenced to fixed exile in Namhae due to his brother's involvement, and no one did not consider it a wrongful imprisonment. Tao's poem written when going to Namhae is extremely loyal and sad, and it is also widely recited by people.
A mountain of great sins, death is also sweet, the grace of the saint is like the sea, exiled to Gangnam. (巨罪如山死亦甘, 聖恩似海謫江南.)
At the crossroads, there are endless grudges, this year my kind mother is sixty-three. (臨岐別有無窮恨, 慈母今年六十三.)

Third, the so-called wrongful imprisonment of Kim Jik-jae (金直哉) that occurred in the spring of the same year, Imja (壬子 year). Initially, Bongsan County Magistrate Sin Yul (申慄) was interrogating thieves he had captured, but the torture was so severe that the thieves, in order to save their lives through reporting a crime, falsely accused Kim Jik-jae, who was famous at the time, of plotting a rebellion. Sin Yul, Military Commander Ryu Gong-ryang (柳公亮), and Governor Yun Hwan (尹暄) believed this and arrested Jik-jae, reporting it to the court. When the court interrogated him, Jik-jae again could not withstand the torture and falsely confessed that he was conspiring with Hwang Hyeok (黃赫) (Hyeok was the son of Janggye-gun (長溪君) Hwang Jeong-hyeok (黃廷或) and the wife's father of Seonjo's sixth son, Sunhwa-gun Gong (順和君玒)) to promote Jinneung-gun Tae-gyeong (晋陵君泰慶) (Jinneung-gun was Sunhwa-gun's stepson, that is, Hwang Hyeok's maternal grandson). As a result, a major incident occurred, and Jinneung-gun, Hwang Hyeok, the entire family of Kim Jik-jae, and dozens of other people involved were massacred. Lee I-cheom and others took this opportunity to accuse Ryu Yeong-gyeong (柳永慶), Lee Hong-ro (李弘老), and others of the crime of endangering Gwanghae when he was Crown Prince, and executed them for treason, shocking the court and the countryside.

Fourth, the great incident of the 5th year, Gyechuk (癸丑 year). Initially, Park Sun (朴淳) (a state councilor)'s concubine's son, Eung-si (應犀), Seo Ik (徐益)'s concubine's son, Yang-gap (羊甲), Sim Jeon (沈銓)'s concubine's son, U-yeong (友英), and Lee Je-sin (李濟臣)'s concubine's son, Gyeong-jun (耕俊), formed a group of ruffians and bandits, killed merchants traveling through Mungyeong Saejae (聞慶鳥嶺) from the capital, and <171> plundered their property. When Captain Han Hui-gil (韓希吉) captured Park Eung-si, Eung-si, like Kim Jik-jae in the previous Imja incident, also made a false accusation in order to avoid punishment, claiming that he was conspiring with Yeonheungbuwon-gun Kim Je-nam (延興府院君金悌男) (Inmok Wanghu (人穆王后)'s father) to enthrone Yeongchang Daegun (永昌大君)*. King Gwanghae personally interrogated Yang-gap and others along with Eung-si, and their statements were the same as Eung-si's. In punishing the crime, he first arrested and imprisoned Kim Je-nam and executed him at the Seoseo crossroad, and also killed his three sons and one son-in-law. Yeongchang Daegun was exiled to Ganghwa, and he was given death by royal decree in the following year, Gapin (甲寅 year). This death of Yeongchang Daegun is a sorrowful event that no one can help but shed tears of sympathy for. At that time, Yeongchang Daegun was only 8 years old and was held in Inmok Wanghu's arms. King Gwanghae forcibly took him away with more than ten strong women and imprisoned him on Ganghwa Island. In February of the following year, Gapin (甲寅 year), Magistrate Jeong Hang (鄭沆) received a secret order for assassination, strictly imprisoned the Grand Prince in a room, and heated the ondol (溫突, Korean floor heating system) intensely, making it unbearably hot. The Grand Prince tried his best to avoid it and climb up the wall, but eventually suffocated to death in the room, his fingernails all burned and turned into charcoal. No one who heard this did not grieve. However, Jeong Hang kept this a secret and reported that he had died by self-immolation. Sajik (司直) Jeong Un (鄭蘊) submitted a memorial criticizing Jeong Hang's crime, but was angered by Gwanghae and placed in Anchi (安置, a form of exile) in Daejeong-gun (大靜郡) (present-day Jeju Island). Later, Jeong Hang repented of his crime and died from illness. When he was reburied after the coup, Yeonganwi (永安尉) Hong Ju-won (洪柱元) mourned the Grand Prince with a poem, saying, "The final instruction is endlessly unreliable, who would not grieve over the deep injustice. Life ends at eight years old, the way of heaven returns in ten years. The white sun illuminates the double spring, the green mountain opens the secluded house. In the Eternal Joy Palace of a thousand autumns, it should be a lookout platform." (遺敎終無賴, 深寃孰不哀. 人生八歲盡, 天道十年廻. 白日重泉照, 靑山幽宅開. 千秋永樂殿, 應作望思臺.) which made many people cry.

Furthermore, Inmok Wanghu was accused of plotting curses internally and participating in this conspiracy externally. Based on the main arguments of Lee I-cheom's faction, Yusaeng Lee Wi-gyeong (李偉卿), Jangnyeong (掌令) Jeong Jo (鄭造), Yun In (尹訒), etc., she was moved to the West Palace (西宮). Furthermore, in the 6th year, Gapin (甲寅 year), based on the main arguments of Left State Councilor Jeong In-hong and Minister of Rites Lee I-cheom, etc., her title of Grand Queen Dowager was abolished (the so-called abolishment of the mother event (廢母事件)) and she was confined to the West Palace. Yi Hang-bok, Yi Won-ik, Gi Ja-heon (奇自獻) <172>, Jeong Hong-ik (鄭弘翼), Kim Deok-seong (金德誠), Sin Heum (申欽), Nam I-gong (南以恭), etc., strongly opposed this and were all exiled (Yi Won-ik was exiled to Hongcheon, Sin Heum to Chuncheon, and Yi Hang-bok to Bukcheong). Furthermore, the Yeonheung-gun clan and many people related to this suffered a tragic fate.

Fifth, the Ayangchang-gun (綾昌君) incident in the 7th year, Eulmyo (乙卯 year). Ayangchang-gun was the third son of Wonjong (元宗) and was ennobled at the age of 15. At that time, someone who had a poor relationship with Sin Gyeong-hui (申景禧) falsely accused him, claiming that Sin Gyeong-hui was plotting a rebellion and promoting Ayangchang Daegun. Gwanghae punished Sin Gyeong-hui for treason, imprisoned Ayangchang Daegun on an island, and had the guards threaten him to commit suicide. Knowing that it was difficult for the Grand Prince to avoid death, he sent a letter of eternal farewell to his parents and then took poison and committed suicide. People at the time felt sorry for him and wrote the following song:

The sand of the sea is vast and boundless, year after year. (海之沱沙渺瀰年年)
The spring is desolate, and the grass is lush. (春漠漠草萋萋.)
Once the prince is gone, he will never return. (王孫一去不復歸.)

The Seoin's Conspiracy and the Gyehae Coup

King Gwanghae's misgovernment was, of course, the fault of Gwanghae himself, but in reality, it was the result of the tyranny of the Daebuk faction (大北派) led by Lee I-cheom and Jeong In-hong, who held power at the time. The general public resented Gwanghae and viewed the Daebuk faction with even more revulsion, as if they were snakes and scorpions. Among them, the Seoin faction, who had been largely expelled from the political arena for many years, felt even more dissatisfied with the rampant behavior of the Daebuk faction, their faction's enemies, and sought to initiate an opposition movement by any means possible if they had the opportunity. Then, the incident of Gwanghae's deposal of his mother occurred, causing great unrest among the general public. The Seoin's decisive faction, Sin Gyeong-jin (申景禛) (Shin Rip (申砬)'s son) and Lee Seo (李曙), viewed this as a golden opportunity and thought to themselves that in order to regain the Daebuk faction's political power, it would be best to fundamentally depose Gwanghae and welcome Ayang-gun (綾陽君) (Seonjo's fifth son, son of Jeongwon-gun (定遠君) (Wonjong), that is, Injo). First, they told Kim Ryu (金瑬) and Choi Myeong-gil (崔鳴吉) their intentions (Kim Ryu's father, Kim Yeo-mul (金汝岉), and Sin Gyeong-jin's father, Sin Rip, had died as martyrs together during the Imjin War, so their friendship was different from others). Kim and Choi agreed to this and pushed Ryu to <173> to be the leader. On the other hand, the literary faction Lee Gwi (李貴) had also been plotting such a scheme with Kim Ja-jeom (金自點), Jang Yu (張維), and Sim Gi-won (沈器遠), and when they joined forces, their potential power was not insignificant. They either bribed palace maids and officials to find out the situation in the palace while preventing their faction's conspiracy from being discovered, or they enlisted many generals such as Won Du-pyo (元斗杓) and Lee Gi-chuk (李起築) to prepare for military action. They also bought off military officials such as Training Commander Lee Heung-rip (李興立) and Dogam Commander Lee Su-il (李守一) to make them internal allies. Lee Seo, a military officer from the North who was proficient in both literature and martial arts, promised to organize a coup army with the troops from Jangan (長湍) to serve as the vanguard, and planned to gather at Hongje-won (弘濟院) on the night of March 12th, Gyehae (癸亥 year), to raise the flag of rebellion. However, Lee Seo's army did not arrive by the appointed time, and not only did Kim Ryu, who was in charge of the overall command of the coup army, not arrive, but Lee I-sa (李以赦), who had participated in the coup, was worried that the affair would fail, so he had his uncle Lee Yu-seong (李惟聖) report to Park Seung-jong on the day of the coup. Injo and others were in great fear, but soon after, Lee Seo arrived leading his troops, and the general public was greatly pleased. Immediately organizing the righteous coup army, they appointed Lee Gwi as the temporary commander in place of Kim Ryu (at that time, Kim Ryu was late, so Lee Gwi took back the military power and monopolized everything. Gwi drew his sword and pointed out Kim Ryu's crime of late participation and tried to behead him, but Lee Gwi stopped him). Like a storm, they ran to Changui Gate (彰義門), but the gate was tightly closed. The vanguards Lee Gi-chuk and Won Du-pyo, two brave warriors, angrily smashed the gate and entered the city, surrounding Changdeok Palace. The military officials who had been on duty in the palace, who had previously cooperated internally, also responded, and Park Seung-jong and his son Ja-heung (自興) and Lee I-cheom fled over the wall. Gwanghae fled and hid in a commoner's house, but was discovered the next day. Injo and the other coup members went to the West Palace and, under the order of Queen Dowager Inmok, proclaimed Gwanghae's 36 crimes and deposed him, then welcomed Injo to ascend the throne. Kim Sang-gung, Park Jeong-gil (朴鼎吉), Lee Wi-gyeong, Han Chan-nam (韓纘男), and Baek Dae-hyeong (白大珩), who had wielded power during Gwanghae's reign, were executed, and <174> Park Seung-jong and his son fled to Songsan (松山) and hanged themselves in front of their ancestral tombs. I-cheom fled as far as Icheon (利川) but was arrested and executed in the marketplace along with Jeong Jo and Yun In. Pyeongan Governor Park Yeop (朴曄), Uiju Governor Jeong Jun (鄭遵), Chungcheong Military Commander Han Hui-gil, and the six Northerners including Ryu Hui-bun and Jeong In-hong were killed or exiled in a sweeping manner. People who had been unjustly accused during Gwanghae's reign were released. Gwanghae-gun and his son Se-ja (秷) were initially going to be killed, but they were not killed due to the opposition of veteran senior officials and were placed under house arrest on Ganghwa Island. The Se-ja and his wife, Park-ssi, dug a hole of about 70 cheok (尺) in the wall and tried to escape at night, but were caught by the guards and hanged themselves. The poem he wrote on his deathbed and the poem he wrote in the enclosure are extremely tragic, making it impossible for anyone who reads them to hold back a handful of tears.

Being originally of the same root, why be so unkind? (本是同根何太薄,)
It is right to love each other and also pity each other. (理宜相愛亦相哀.)
Why escape this cage, (緣何脫此樊籠去,)
Let us go and come freely along the green mountains and waters. (緣水靑山任去來.) (Written in the enclosure)
The dust is turbulent like a raging wave, (塵稟翻覆似狂瀾,)
Why worry and be idle? (何必憂愁意自閒.)
Twenty-six years have become a dream, (二十六年成一夢,)
It is good to follow and return to the white clouds. (好隨歸去白雲間.) (Written on his deathbed)

And Gwanghae-gun was later exiled to Jeju, where his poem "Written on a Boat at Sea in Jeju" is also extremely sorrowful.

The fiery wind blows rain over the city head, (炎風吹雨過城頭,)
The miasmic air steams up a hundred-foot tower. (瘴氣薰蒸百尺樓.)
The old waves of the blue sea come at dusk, (滄海老濤來薄暮,)
The sorrowful colors of the green mountain send off the clear autumn. (碧山愁色送淸秋.)
My returning heart is always tied to the grass of the prince, (歸心每結王孫草,)
My guest's dreams frequently startle the island of the imperial son. (客夢頻驚帝子洲.)
News of the rise and fall of the old country is cut off, (故國興亡消息斷,)
I lie on a lonely boat on the misty river. (烟波江上臥孤舟.)

Two Beautiful Women in the Midst of the Coup

In any movement, there is invariably the unnoticed assistance of women. In this Gyehae Coup (癸亥反正運動), there were also two beautiful women: one was the daughter of Lee Gwi of Yeonpyeong (延平 李貴), and the other was the wife of the brave warrior Lee Gi-chuk (李起築). Lee Gwi's daughter was originally married to Kim Ja-jeom's younger brother, Ja-gyeom (自兼), but unfortunately became a widow in her youth and lived a pitiful single life. She had an affair with Oh Heom (吳謙), the son of Chamsan (參贊) Oh Heom, and fled to Geochang-gun (居昌郡), Gyeongsangnam-do (慶尙南道), to avoid the eyes and ears of the world, living in hiding in a stone cave. However, as the saying goes, "good things are often beset by evil," the affair was discovered, and Heon-gwan (彦寬) was beaten to death. Ms. Lee was so pessimistic about the world that she shaved her head and became a female monk. Later, wandering around, she returned to the capital and stayed at Jasugung (慈壽宮), and through her connection with the palace people, she sometimes visited the palace. At that time, Kim Sang-gung (Gaettong-i), who had a great influence in the palace, had a deeper friendship with Ms. Lee than with her own mother, so she listened to everything she said, and Gwanghae absolutely trusted Kim Sang-gung, so she was of great assistance in this coup movement. Not only assistance, but if Ms. Lee had not been there, the coup faction would have suffered the great disaster of extermination, let alone succeeding. To give an example, in the first month of Gyehae, Lee Gwi and others' coup plot was leaked in advance, and Han Yu-hyang (韓惟翔) reported it, and the disaster of that faction was imminent. Lee Gwi had his daughter ask Kim Sang-gung to beg for her father's life, and in form, he personally led his sons and brothers and <176> waited for orders and submitted a memorial explaining, saying, "The grace of the saint in giving food in Icheon, giving wine in Gokseong, giving cloth in Jangseong, and giving silk in Sukcheon (previously, King Gwanghae had given Lee Gwi such favors) is difficult to forget as long as heaven and earth exist. My father is the one who gave me life, and your majesty is the one who will save me. Now that I have been branded with the infamous name of treason, please quickly kill my father and sons. ... ..."

Kim Sang-gung told Gwanghae, "Lee Pyeong-san (李平山) is a pitiful person in this world, and Kim Seo-bang (金書房) (referring to Ja-jeom (自點)) is a scholar, so there is nothing to discuss." Gwanghae just laughed and listened, and finally avoided the disaster. On the day of the coup, March 20th, Lee Yu-seong conveyed the contents to Park Seung-jong (in terms of the actual route, Lee Hu-won (李厚源) first asked Lee Yu-hong's son, I-ban (以攽), to participate in the coup (when Yu-hong was exiled to Gyeo, Kim Nung (金凌) was the magistrate at that time and was close to him), I-ban told his uncle Yu-seong, and Yu-seong told Kim Guk (金*國, missing Hanja), and Kim Guk told Park Seung-jong). Seung-jong went to the palace to report the change, and the ministers and the officials of the Geumbusa (禁府) all gathered in the palace and waited for the order, so the disaster was also imminent. Then, Kim Ja-jeom prepared a large amount of liquor and food and bribed Kim Sang-gung, and Lee Gwi had his own daughter vehemently explain to Kim Sang-gung that it was not true. Gwanghae only listened to Kim Sang-gung's words and did not even look at the report of the change, and rested assured and enjoyed the banquet with the palace people. When the day was already late and the palace gate was closed, the ministers and Geumbusa officials had no choice but to retreat to the Bibyeonsa (備邊司) outside the palace gate and wait for orders. When the coup army suddenly arrived in the middle of the night, everything collapsed.

Lee Gi-chuk's wife was the daughter of a Gyeongju Ibang (吏房) official. She was beautiful from a young age, able to understand writing, and also had great insight. Her parents especially cherished her. She was past the age of 28, and although there were marriage proposals from all sides, she absolutely refused, always saying that the man who would be her mate was different, and she would not marry anyone else. One day, a dark-skinned young man came to her house to be hired. He was honest and had great strength, but he was illiterate and had a rough appearance, so the family all despised him, but the young woman especially loved him and asked her parents to marry him. Her parents were greatly angry and scolded and beat her, obstructing her in every way, but the woman insisted on dying and marrying that man, so her parents eventually had no choice but to allow the marriage. That man was Lee Gi-chuk (Gi-chuk was originally orphaned and grew up wandering, so his background was unknown and his surname was also unknown, but because he was a Gi-chuk, people called him Gi-chuk. Later, during the coup, Lee Seo admired his character and made him his cousin, so he became Lee-ssi, and the name Gi-chuk was given by Injo). However, her family considered it a great shame to their family and ordered her to move far away. The woman also did not want to stay in Gyeongju and obtained some money and property from her parents, moved to the capital carrying her husband on her back and in a small shack in Pyeong-dong (平洞) outside the West Gate <176> started a business selling alcohol. At that time, Gwanghae was misgoverning, and as mentioned above, Seoin figures were secretly plotting a coup, wandering around temples in the mountains or pine forests. One day, Gi-chuk's wife called Gi-chuk and carefully prepared a volume of Tonggam (痛鑑) and a table of liquor, saying, "Take this to a pine forest in Hongje-won. There, about 10 scholars will be holding a meeting. Don't say anything, just offer the liquor, and after it's over, open the marked spot in the book and ask them to teach it to you, and on the way back, bring the guests to our house." Originally, Gi-chuk, who was honest and had no adaptability, and acted exactly as his wife said, carried the liquor and book and went to the place. As expected, more than ten Confucian scholars were sitting there discussing something. Seeing Gi-chuk, they were very surprised. Gi-chuk did not say anything, bowed, offered the liquor, and asked them to teach him the book. The people were even more surprised. The people gathered there were of course Lee Gwi, Choi Myeong-gil, Sim Gi-won, and others, and the passage in the book was the passage in the fourth volume of Tonggam about Huo Guang's deposition of the Changyi King (霍光). The people were so strange that they asked about the contents in detail, and it was entirely his wife's teaching. The people went straight to Gi-chuk's house, and his wife came out cheerfully to greet them, saying, "I have already guessed your intentions. How can there be a country without a mother in the world? The gods will help your plan, so why worry about not succeeding? However, let's abandon the meetings in the suburbs, and although our house is a secluded and humble place, it is convenient, and the taste of the liquor is not inferior. Although my husband is illiterate, he is honest and his courage is extraordinary, so he can be entrusted with great things. I just hope you don't forget it after the success in the future." Everyone was surprised and happy and always gathered at his house. The woman's opinion was outstanding, and she taught the various plans for the coup to the people, and there were no mistakes. Gi-chuk went in and out of Injo's private residence and took care of all kinds of dangerous tasks. He also communicated with Jangan Magistrate Lee Seo and traveled back and forth to Jangan every day, killing three horses within a year. On the day of the uprising, he took the lead as the vanguard and broke down Changui Gate with Won Du-pyo and stormed in. When the time came to discuss rewards for meritorious service after the success, the first thing that came up was to reward the Pyeongdong barmaid, and he was given the title of Gun (完溪君) (Wanguigun), and the woman was given the title of Jeonggyeongbuin (貞敬夫人). Later, in Byeongja, Gi-chuk also killed many enemies in Namhansanseong (南漢山城) and achieved military merit. When the Se-ja was taken as a hostage to Shenyang, he was one of the so-called 28 generals who accompanied him, but he returned first due to illness. All of his life's work was entirely based on his wife's teachings.

The Results and Impact of the Injo Coup <177>

As mentioned above, the Injo Coup ostensibly used King Gwanghae's misgovernment as a reason, but in content, the Seoin's ambition to exterminate the Northerners and seize power into their own hands was greater. Therefore, when discussing the punishment of crimes and the awarding of merit at the time of the coup, it was excessive. Not only the leaders of the Daebuk faction, such as Jeong In-hong and Lee I-cheom, and the leaders of the Sobuk faction, such as Ryu Hui-bun and Park Seung-jong, but also anyone who was even slightly involved in the Daebuk or Sobuk faction, regardless of whether they were guilty or not, were all killed or exiled. The tragic situation was more severe than in the era of Gwanghae, Lee I-cheom, and Jeong In-hong's use of power. The Seoin faction of Kim Ryu, Lee Gwi, and 54 others, who discussed the merits of the coup, all participated in the Jeongsa Merit Subjects (靖社功臣) and received considerable honors. However, people outside their faction, even if they had great merits, were not given great honors. To give the most extreme example

仁祖反正의 裏面史
						車相瓚
光海主 즉위 당시의 조선정국
광해 15년 3월 13일 밤. 거금 307년전 陽 4월 10일에 청천벽력가치 이러난 소위 인조반정의 대정변은 표면으로 보면 물론 燕山朝 시대에 成希顔, 朴元宗 등의 宗社를 위하야 撥亂反正의 명의로 昏暴한 연산군을 쫒차내고 中宗을 드려세운 것과 다름이 업지만은 그 이면을 살펴보면 그와 아주 달너서 소위 종사를 위하더니 반정이 *하는 말은 그 실은 당시 실각하엿던 西人의 무리들이 자기네 정적인 大北派의 광해조 정부를 따려부시고 자파 정부를 새로 수립한 일개 야욕적 당쟁이엿다. 이제 그 내막의 자세한 것을 말하자면 순서로 먼저 광해군 즉위 당시의 정국형편을 잠간 遡論하는 것같이 필요될 것이다.
광해군은 누구나 잘아는 바와가치 宣祖大王의 第二子엿다. 첨에 선조는 적자가 업고 臨海君 이하 12의 서자가 잇섯는데 장자 임해군*을 성행이 광포하야 人望을 일허버리고 其次 광해군이 비교적 인망이 잇엇던 중 壬辰兵亂을 임하야 선조가 의주에 播遷하게 되니 선조는 時權道로 광해군을 세워 세자를 삼고 撫軍監國의 대책을 委＜167＞

(168면 원본 낙장 - 국편)

히 잇스니 이제 그 대개를 말하자면 內治로는 첫재에 서울의 復興事業이니 서울은 壬辰兵亂에 여러 宮殿을 爲始하야 일반 市廛建物이 모도 沒燒되고 한갓 焦土만 남다 십히 하얏섯는데 宣祖當時에는 兵亂의 즉후임으로 감히 復興工事에 着手치 못하더니 光海가 즉위하매 百難을 除하고 먼저 이 國都再建에 전력하야 즉위즉시(戌申)에 宗廟를 重建하고 그 翌年己酉에는 昌德宮을 재건하야 此에 移御하고 (壬亂後로부터 그때까지는 月山大君의 舊邸 「지금 德壽宮자리」에 임시 御所를 삼엇다) 또 그 翌年 庚戌(光海2년)에는 東西南北四學을 重建하고 6년甲寅에는 昌德宮內에 欽敬閣을 새로 세웟스며 7년 乙卯에는 昌德宮을 重修하고 8년 丙辰에는 仁慶, 慶德(永城門안 대궐-지금 日京城中學校址)兩宮을 또 新建하얏고 文敎로는 상술함과 가치 四學을 重建하야 국민교육에 힘을 쓰는 동시에 元年己酉에는 重試, 對策, 別試의 試驗制(卽 科制)를 始設하야 人才를 登庸하고 武敎로는 11년己末에 萬人科를 新設하야 武士萬人을 選拔하고 次에 外交로는 元年 己酉에 琉球가 貢物을 獻하고 兄弟의 和好를 請하매 此를 許하고 釜山港에 첨으로 市를 開하야 日本人과 互商하며 9년 丁巳에는 通信史를 日本에 遣하야 修好하고 11년 己末에는 明에 援兵을 보내서 淸을 助伐하고 (所謂 深河役) 12년庚申에는 淸의 國境侵入을 염려하야 明과 교섭한 결과 明의 駐兵으로 朝鮮의 國境防禦를 援助케 하얏스며 14년 壬戌에는 新興하는 淸의 세력이 날로 큼을 보고 密使(明을 기피하야)를 보내 修好하는 동시에 一方으로 平壤監司 朴曄을 督勵하야 國境防備에 不怠하얏섯다.

光海君의 失政
그러나 兵亂卽後에 多年間 거대한 공사를 한 결과는 民力이 극도로 피폐하야 怨聲이 四方에서 이러나고 國庫가＜169＞ 涸渴하야 9년 丁巳에 不得己賣官法과 納金續刊法을 公然 施行하게 되니 宮中과 府中에 賄賂가 公行하야 官紀가 一層紊亂하고 法網이 크게 解弛하며 宮中에는 金尙宮(名은 개똥이)을 위시하야 李尙宮, 尹, 許, 洪, 權의 諸淑儀등이 寵愛을 밋고 威暴을 擅行하고 政府에는 小北派의 朴承宗, 柳希奮(光海妃兄)등과 大北의 李爾瞻
鄭仁弘등이 서로 알륵하고 서로 誣謟하야 허다한 冤獄을 이르케섯다. 그 중에 중요한 例를 몃가지 들어 말하자면
제1은 臨海君의 賜死니 臨海君은 恭嬪金氏의 所生으로 光海君의 同母兄이엿다. 性行이 원래 狂悖한 까닭에 宣祖가 其次光海君으로 世子를 삼엇더니 宣祖가 승하하고 光海가 즉위한 후 明나라에 封冊을 請하매 (그때는 明國과 主從關係가 有한 까닭에 王位繼承할때마다 冊封의 形式을 受한 例가 잇섯다.) 明은 廢長主幼의 不可를 主張하야 遼東都司嚴一塊를 朝鮮에 特派하야 (實은 嚴의 代理萬某가 來함) 臨海君의 病否를 査實하니 (光海冊封을 請할 때에 臨海君이 宿病이 잇서서 政務를 視키 불능하다고 이유를 삼은 까닭이다.) 朝廷에서는 臨海君을 喬桐謫所로부터 西江에 소환하야 그 병상을 실지로 뵈키고 (先是에 臨海君이 不軌의 陰謀가 잇다는 嫌疑로 珎島에 유배되엿다가 喬桐에 移함)領中樞李德馨, 戶判黃愼을 陳奏使로 보내 僅히 문제를 해결하얏스나 大司憲 鄭仁弘, 大提學 李爾瞻등이 근본으로 臨海君을 除하야 禍根을 絶함이 可하다고 主張하니 王은 領相李元翼(梧里) 左相李恒福(白沙)의 반대가 잇슴에 불구하고 仁弘의 言에 從하야 賜死하얏섯다. 그리고 제2는 光海 4년 王子에 權石洲韓의 詩案冤獄이니 韓은 南人派習齊權擘의 제2자니 爲人이 亢直不覊하고 詩才가 탁월하야 명성이 1세를 풍미하얏는데 당시 光海의 妃兄柳希奮이 兵判으로 잇스면서 國權을 擅弄하매 踈菴任叔英이 此를 論䟽하다가 被黜하니 例의 權氏는 『宮柳靑靑鶯亂啼, 滿城冠盖媚春暉. 朝廷共賀昇平樂, 誰遣危言出布衣.』 云云의 詩를 지여 諷刺하엿더니 (宮柳는 柳希奮, 布衣는 任叔英을 가르침슝�다.) 希奮은 此를 怨恨하야 光海에게 誣告하야 親鞠까지 하다가 減死流配를 命하더니 중도에서 다시 賜死하고 (權이 配所에 가는 길에 東大門外에서 留宿하는데 그 旅舍壁上에 權君 「原文은 勸君」 更進一盃酒, 酒不到劉伶墳上土! 句가 씨워 잇는 것을 보고 마음에 不樂하더니 未幾에 賜師함으로 世人인 그것을 讖言이라 하얏다.) 그 兄 韜는 弟의 連坐로 또한 南海에 定配되니 누구나 冤枉이 녁이지 안는 사람이 업섯다. 韜의 南海行時一首의 詩는 辭意가 극히 忠厚하고도 悲愴한데 世人이 또한 膾煮하는 바이다.
巨罪如山死亦甘, 聖恩似海謫江南.
臨岐別有無窮恨, 慈母今年六十三.
제3은 同年壬子春에 이러난 所謂 金直哉冤獄이니 첨에 鳳山郡守申慄이 盜賊을 잡어 訊問하는데 栲問이 너무도 심함으로 盜賊告發의 功으로 자기의 생명을 구하기 위하야 당시 朝露에 名聲이 잇는 金直哉가 反逆을 謀한다 誣告하엿더니 申慄과 兵使柳公亮, 監司尹暄등이 그것을 信聽하고 直哉를 체포하야 朝廷에 啓한 바 朝廷에서 鞠問할 때에 直哉는 또 栲問을 못익여 誣告하되 黃赫(赫은 長溪君 黃廷或의 子요 宣祖第六男 順和君玒의 妻父)과 共謀하야 晋陵君泰慶을 推戴코자 한다하니 (晋陵君은 順和君의 繼子니 즉 黃赫의 外孫이다.) 이에 큰 獄事가 이러나서 晋陵君을 위시하야 黃赫, 金直哉의 가족 일동 기타 이에 關聯한 인물 수십인을 참살하고 李爾瞻등은 또 이 기회를 타서 柳永慶, 李弘老등의 前日 光海東宮時謀危한 죄를 論하야 대역죄로 誅하니 朝野가 震駭하얏다.
제4는 5년 癸丑 大獄事니 첨에 朴淳(相臣)의 妾子應犀와 徐益의 妾子羊甲 沈銓의 妾子友英, 李濟臣의 妾子 耕俊等이 無賴의 漢과 盜黨을 지여 聞慶鳥嶺에서 통행하는 京城의 상인을 죽이고＜171＞ 財物을 약탈하다가 포도대장 韓希吉에게 朴應犀가 被捉하니 往年 壬子 獄事때에 金直哉의 例와가치 應犀가 自罪를 免코자 하야 또한 誣告하되 延興府院君金悌男(人穆王后의 父)과 共謀하야 永昌大君*를 擁立코자 한다 하니 光海君은 羊甲등을 一並親鞠한즉 또한 應犀의 言과 同一함으로 이에 罪를 治할새 먼저 金悌男을 捕拿下獄하얏다가 城西十字街에서 死刑에 처한 외에 또 其三子 一婿를 並殺하고 永昌大君은 江華로 流配하얏다가 그 翌年 甲寅에 賜死하니 이 永昌大君의 죽업은 千古에 悲憤하야 누구나 동정의 눈물을 아니 흘일 수 업다. 그 때에 永昌大君은 나히 僅히 8세로 仁穆王后의 품속에 앙겨 잇섯는데 光海君은 健婦十餘人으로 此를 㥘奪하야 江華島에 幽囚하엿더니 그 翌年 甲寅 2월에 府使鄭沆이 암살의 밀지를 밧고 大君을 房中에 嚴囚한 후 猛烈하게 불을 때니 溫突이 불과가치 뜨거워서 견듸기 어러움으로 大君은 그것을 피하야 벽으로 올나가랴고 별반의 애를 다 쓰다가 결국 숨이 막혀 방중에서 죽엇는데 손툽이 모다 타서 木炭가치 되니 듯는 者가 슬퍼하지 안은 이 업섯다. 그러나 鄭沆은 此를 비밀에 붓치고 自燒하야 죽엇다고 啓聞하니 司直鄭蘊이 䟽를 上하야 鄭沆의 죄를 論하다가 反히 光海에게 觸怒되야 大靜郡(今濟州島)에 安置되얏다. 그 뒤에 鄭沆은 自罪를 悔恨하다가 病이 發하 야 죽고 反正後 還葬할 때에 永安尉洪柱元은 詩로 大君을 挽하야 曰 『遺敎終無賴, 深寃孰不哀. 人生八歲盡, 天道十年廻. 白日重泉照, 靑山幽宅開. 千秋永樂殿, 應作望思臺.』라 하야 여러 사람을 울이엿다.
그리고 또 仁穆王后는 안으로 咀呪를 하고 밧그로 또 이 逆謀에 干與하얏다는 이유로 李爾瞻의 一派 儒生 李偉卿 掌令鄭造, 尹訒등의 主論에 의하야 西宮에 移하얏다가 또 6년 甲寅에 左相 鄭仁弘, 禮判 李爾瞻등의 主論에 의하야 大妃의 尊號를 廢하고 (所謂 廢母事件) 西宮에 幽閉하니 李恒福, 李元翼, 奇自獻＜172＞, 鄭弘翼, 金德誠, 申欽, 南以恭등이 極力反對하다가 모도 被竄되고 (李元翼은 洪川, 申欽은 春川, 李恒福은 北靑에 流竄됨) 其他 延興君 一族과 此에 관련한 多數한 사람이 慘禍를 당하얏다.
제5는 또 7년 乙卯綾昌君獄事니 綾昌君은 元宗의 第三子로 15세에 封君되엿는데 때에 엇던 사람이 申景禧와 틈이 좃치 못하야 誣告하되 申景禧가 謀反하야 綾昌大君을 推戴한다하니 光海는 申景禧를 逆罪에 처하고 綾昌大君은 海島에 囚하얏다가 守衛하는 者로 하야금 威脅하야 자살케 하니 君이 免死키 難함을 知하고 父母에게 永訣의 書를 送한 후 약을 먹고 자살하니 때의 사람들이 그를 불상이 넉여 아래와 가흔 노래를 지엿섯다.
海之沱沙渺瀰年年 春漠漠草萋萋.
王孫一去不復歸.

西人의 陰謀와 癸亥反正
光海君의 이러한 失政은 물론 光海 자신의 잘못도 잘못이지만은 그 實은 당시 政權을 잡은 李爾瞻, 鄭仁弘등 大北派專橫의 결과인 故로 일반은 光海君을 怨하는 동시에 大北派를 더욱 蛇蝎와 가치 보게 되엿다. 그 중에도 多年間 政界에서 大驅逐을 당한 西人派는 自派의 仇敵인 大北派의 跋扈하는데 一層 불평을 품게 되야 기회만 잇스면 무슨 방법을 쓰던지 反對運動을 하랴고 하엿다. 그러다가 마츰 光海의 廢母事件이 발생하야 일반인심이 매우 불안하게 되매 그것을 千載好機로 본 西人武斷派 申景禛(申砬의 子) 李曙등은 스스로 생각하되 大北派의 政權을 奪還하는 데는 무엇보다도 이 기회에 근본적으로 光海君을 廢하고 綾陽君(宣祖의 第五子 定遠君(元宗)의 子니 즉 仁祖다)을 迎立하는 것이 조켓다고 하고 먼저 金瑬, 崔鳴吉에게 그 뜻을 말하니(瑬의 父 金汝岉은 景禛의 父 申砬과 共히 壬亂때 殉節한 故로 交誼가 與他 自別함) 金崔는 此를 贊同함으로 瑬를＜173＞ 推하야 首領을 삼고 또 일방에서는 文人派 李貴가 미리부터 金自點, 張維, 沈器遠등과 또한 이러한 음모를 하다가 때에 또한 서로 합하니 그 잠세력이 또한 적지 안엇다. 그들은 혹은 賂賄로 궁중의 尙宮女官을 결탁하야 궁내 정세를 債察하는 동시에 自派의 음모발각될 것을 예방하고 혹은 元斗杓, 李起築가흔 多數 장사를 망라하야 무력준비를 하며 또 訓練大將 李興立, 都監大將 李守一등의 군인을 買收하야 內應을 삼고 文 武智勇이 雙全한 北兵使 李曙는 長湍兵으로 反正軍을 조직하야 前衛를 하게 약속하고 癸亥 3월 12일 밤을 期하야 弘濟院에 모혀 反旗를 들기로 計劃하얏다. 그러나 定刻이 되도록 李曙의 軍이 당도치 안코 또 反正軍의 總指揮의 責을 맛튼 金瑬도 안이 올뿐 안이라 反正運動에 참가하엿던 李以赦이 大事가 실패될가 恐慮하야 반정 당일에 其叔李惟聖으로 하야금 朴承宗에게 고발한 까닭에 仁祖以下 여러 사람이 크게 恐惶中에 잇더니 未幾에 李曙가 兵을 率하고 來着함으로 일반이 크게 깃버하야 즉시 正反正軍을 조직할새 金瑬의 代로 李适을 임시 總指揮官으로 삼고 (그때 金瑬가 遲着하야 李适의 兵權을 다시 뺏고 萬事를 專橫하니 适을 劍을 拔하야 金瑬의 遲參한 죄를 지적하고 斬코자 하다가 李貴가 末由中止함) 風雨와가치 彰義門까지 달녀오니 門이 굿게 닷치엿슴으로 先鋒 李起築
元斗杓 두 壯士는 독긔로 門을 破碎하고 城內에 돌입하야 昌德宮을 포위하고 미리 內應하얏던 軍人등이 또한 호응하니 宮內에 입직하엿던 承旨軍官등은 四散逃走하고 朴承宗과 其子自興及 李爾瞻은 城을 넘어 도주하고 光海는 도망하야 민가에 숨엇다가 翌日에 발각되엿다. 仁祖 以下 反正黨의 여러 사람은 西宮에 가서 仁穆大妃의 命을 承하야 光海의 36죄를 聲言하고 位를 廢한 후 仁祖를 迎하야 王位에 卽케 하고 光海當時에 用權하던 金尙宮, 朴鼎吉, 李偉卿, 韓纘男, 白大珩을 處斬하고＜174＞ 朴承宗의 父子는 도주하야 松山 에 것다가 자기의 先墓前에서 목을 매여 죽고 爾瞻은 利川까지 도주하다가 체포되야 鄭造, 尹訒등과가치 戮市를 당하고 平安監司 朴曄, 義州府尹 鄭遵 忠淸兵使 韓希吉外 柳希奮, 鄭仁弘等 六北及 小北派를 一綱打盡的으로 斬殺或 流竄하고 光海時 被罪한 인물을 일절 석방하며 光海君과 其世子 秷는 츰에 죽이랴고 하얏다가 元老 重臣의 반대로 죽이지는 안코 江華島에 圍籬安置하얏더니 世子及 其妃朴氏는 墻內에서 70여척의 窟穴을 뚜르고 乘夜逃走하다가 守卒에게 잽히매 목을 매여 自死하얏다. 그의 臨死에 지은 일절의 詩와 圍籬中에 지은 詩는 극히 悲慘하야 읽는 사람으로 하야금 一掬의 淚를 금할 수 업게 되엿다.

本是同根何太薄, 理宜相愛亦相哀.
緣何脫此樊籠去, 緣水靑山任去來.(圍籬中作)
塵稟翻覆似狂瀾, 何必憂愁意自閒.
二十六年成一夢, 好隨歸去白雲間.(臨死時作)

그리고 光海君은 뒤에 다시 濟州로 流配되엿는데 그의 濟州海 舟中作 詩도 또한 극히 悲悵하다.

炎風吹雨過城頭, 瘴氣薰蒸百尺樓.
滄海老濤來薄暮, 碧山愁色送淸秋.
歸心每結王孫草, 客夢頻驚帝子洲.
故國興亡消息斷, 烟波江上臥孤舟.

反正亂中에 二個花形女性
엇던 운동이던지 그 內面에는 반듯시 남모르는 女性의 援助가 잇는 것이 通例이다. 이 癸亥反正運動에도 2개의 花形女性이 잇섯스니 한 여자는 延平 李貴의 딸이오 또 한 여자는 壯士 李起築의 夫人이엿다. 李貴의 딸은 원래 金自點의 아우 自兼에게 出嫁하엿더니 불행이 靑春에 寡婦가 되야 가련한 獨身生活을 하다가 參贊吳謙의 아들 彦寬과 情을 통하고 세상 사람의 耳目을 피하야 멀이 慶尙南道 居昌郡으로 逃亡하야 石窟속에서 潛跡生活을 하더니 好事多魔로 일이 발각되야 彦寬이 杖刑으로 被死하니 이씨는 世事를 그만 悲觀하야 머리를 깍고 女僧이 되엿더니 그뒤에 流離轉轉하야 다시 京城에 드러와 慈壽宮에 寄留하며 그 宮人의 인연으로 또 宮中에 出入을 각금 하게 되엿섯다. 그 때 宮中에 一大 薰大의 세력을 가젓던 金尙宮(개똥이)은 李氏와 金尙宮間에는 親母女보다도 情誼가 두터워서 무슨 말이던지 다 듯게 되고 또 光海는 金尙宮의 말을 절대 信聽함으로 이 反正의 運動에도 여간한 援助가 되지 안엇섯다. 아니 다만 援助뿐 아니라 만일 李氏가 업섯더면 反正派가 成功은 그만두고 먼저 赤族의 大禍를 입엇슬 터이다. 한 例를 드러 말하자면 癸亥正月에 李貴等의 反正陰謀가 미리 누설되야 韓惟翔이 論啓하매 그 一派의 禍가 일발의 위기에 임하얏는데 李貴는 그딸로 하야금 金尙宮에게 말하야 父命을 哀乞케 하고 또 形式으로는 자기가 아들 형제를 親率하고＜176＞ 命을 待하며 辨明上疏하야 曰 『伊川에서 賜饌하신 것과 谷山에서 賜酒하신 것과 長城에서 賞布하신 것과 肅川에서 賜紬(先是에 光海君이 李貴에 이러튕� 賜恩이 잇섯다)하신 것은 天壤이 無窮하도록 聖恩을 잇기 어러운 터이라 臣을 生한 者는 父요 臣을 活하실 이는 聖明이신 바 이제 謀逆의 악명을 쓰게 되엿사오니 臣의 父子를 속히 죽여 주소서. ... ...』
하니 金尙宮이 光海에게 告하야 曰 李平山은 이세상에 한 可憐人生이오 金書房(指自點)은 一個 書生인 즉 족히 可論할 바 못된다 하니 光海가 그저 웃고 듯게 되야 遂히 禍를 免하고 또 反正當日 즉 3월 20일에도 李惟聖이 그 내용을 朴承宗에게 傳言하야 (事實의 經路로 말하면 츰에 李厚源이 李惟弘의 子以攽에게 反正에 참가하기를 請하얏더니 「惟弘이 江界에 謫하얏슬 때에 其時 金凌가 府使로 잇서서 相親한 까닭에」以紋은 其叔惟聖에게 말하고 惟聖은 金*國, 金은 朴承宗에게 말함) 承宗이 詣闕告變하니 大臣及 禁府堂上이 모도 闕下에 뫼여서 處分을 기다리게 되매 禍가 또한 急迫하게 되엿더니 例의 金自點이 酒饌을 크게 盛備하야 金尙宮을 買收하고 李貴는 또 自己의 딸로 하야금 그럿치 안은 것을 金尙宮에게 極口辨明하니 光海는 다만 金尙宮의 말만 듯고 告變狀도 본체 만체 하며 안심하고 宮人과 가치 宴樂하다가 날이 이미 저물어 闕門을 닷치게 되니 大臣及 禁府官들은 부득이 闕門外 備邊司에 退留하며 命을 기다리다가 밤중에 이르러 反正軍이 突至하니 萬事가 다 瓦解하얏다.
李起築의 夫人은 公州 吏房의 딸이 엿다. 어러서부터 姿色이 絶佳하고 文字를 能解하는 외에 知鑑이 또한 만흐니 그의 父母가 특히 寵愛하얏섯다. 芳年이 28을 지내서 四處에서 通婚을 하되 그는 절대로 사절하고 항상 말하기를 자기의 배필될 男子는 따루 잇스닛가 그 사람이 안이면 결혼치 안는다 하더니 하루는 자기의 집에 엇던 떡거머리 총각이 드러와서 雇傭하게 되엿는대 爲人인 충직하고 힘이 장사이나 丁不識丁하고 形容이 또한 험하게 생겻슴으로 家人이 모도 천시하는데 惟獨 그 처녀는 그를 특히 사랑하며 또 남편 삼기를 부모에게 청하니 부모는 크게 怒하야 그를 罵之打之하며 百方으로는 阻害하얏스나 그 여자는 限死하고 그 남자와 결혼하겟다고 함으로 부모도 야종에는 엇지 하지 못하고 결혼을 許하니 그 남자는 즉 李起築이엿다.(起築은 원래에 早失父母하고 流離生長을 한 까닭에 그 來歷도 알 수 업고 姓도 또한 모르는데 다만 己丑인 까닭에 남이 부르기를 그저 己丑이라고 하얏다가 그 뒤에 反正亂때에 李曙가 그의 爲人을 壯히 녁여 從兄弟를 매저서 李氏가 되고 起築이란 이름은 仁祖가 賜名한 것이엿다.) 그러나 그 親家에서는 그것을 家門의 큰 羞恥로 생각하고 遠方으로 移居하기를 命하니 그 여자도 역시 公州에 잇기를 원치 아니하고 그 부모에게 약간의 錢財를 어더가지고 男負女戴로 京城에 移轉하야 西門박 平洞＜176＞ 한 오막사리속에서
賣酒營業을 하얏섯다. 그 때에 光海가 失政하야 上述함과 가치 西人派 某某인물들이 江亭野寺 혹은 松林가흔 비밀 處를 차저다니며 反正의 陰謀를 하는데 하루는 起築의 夫人이 起築을 불너 痛鑑 한 卷과 술 한상을 精하게 잘 차려주며 말하되 당신이 이것을 가지고 弘濟院 엇던 松林中으로 가면 그곳에 10여人의 名士가 회의를 할 터이니 아모 말도 말고 술을 勸한 다음에 그것이 끈나거던 책속의 標지른 곳을 펴서 놋코 그것을 가르처 달나하고 歸路에 또 그 손임들을 다리고 자기 집으로 오라고 하얏다. 원래에 성질이 忠直하고 아모 變通이 업서서 자기의 처가 안지라면 안꼬 서라면 서는 起築은 그말대로 술과 책을 질머지고 그곳에 가본 즉 과연 儒生 十餘人이 들너 안저서 무슨 議論을 하다가 起築을 보고는 大驚小怪하는지라 起築은 아모 말도 하지 안코 拜禮를 한 다음에 술을 드리고 또 冊을 펴며 가르처 주기를 請하니 여러 사람들이 더욱 놀낫섯다. 거긔에 뫼힌 사람은 물론 李貴, 崔鳴吉, 沈器遠, 등 某某 인물이오 그 책의 개시한 곳은 通鑑四卷의 霍光이 昌邑王을 廢黜한 구절이엿다. 여러 사람들은 하도 이상하야 그 내용을 자서히 물으니 전혀 起築의 夫人의 가르침이엿다. 여러 사람들은 그길로 起築의 집으로 가니 그 夫人은 欣然이 나와서 마즈며 말하되 여러분의 뜻은 내가 미리 짐작하는 바라 세상에 엇지 無母의 國이 잇스리오 여러분의 計劃은 神人이 協助할 터인즉 엇지 不成功을 걱정하리오. 그러나 郊外會合은 廢하고 비록 僻地陋媿한 곳이나마 우리집이 종용도하고 술맛이 또한 劣등은 아니요. 우리 남편이 비록 目不識丁하나 爲䊺�이 忠直하고 勇力이 過人한 즉 大事를 가히 付托할지라 他日 成功한 뒤에 행혀 忘棄치나 말나 하니 여러 사람들이 모도 놀나며 깃버하야 항상 그의 집에서 모듸게 되엿는대 그 여자는 意見이 卓越하야 反正의 諸般計劃을 여러 사람에게 가르처 주니 한아도 失手함이 업고 起築은 仁祖의 私邸로 出入하며 여러가지의 위험한 일은 모도 맛터 하고 또 長湍府使 李曙와 連絡을 통하야 每日 長湍을 往復하는데 一年之內에 말을 세 匹이나 죽이고 거사 당일에는 先鋒으로 나서서 元斗杓와 가치 彰義門을 깨트리고 돌격하얏섯다. 成事後論功行賞할 때에 第一로 平洞酒母의 酬功할 것이 話頭에 올나 策勳封君(完溪君)하고 그 여자는 貞敬夫人의 爵號를 賜하얏다. 그 뒤 丙子에 起築은 南漢山城에서도 胡兵을 만히 擊斬하야 軍功을 이르고 世子가 瀋陽에 入質될 때에는 所謂 28 장사중 한사람으로 隨行하얏다가 病으로 먼저 도라 왓섯는데 평생의 모든 일은 전혀 그 夫人의 가르침을 바덧다 한다.

仁祖反正의 結果와 及 其影響＜177＞

上述함과 가치 仁祖反正은 표면상 光海君의 失政을 이유로 삼엇지만은 내용을 그보다도 西人이 北人을 박멸하고 政權을 自派의 手中에 奪送하랴는 야심이 더 만혓기 때문에 反正 당시에 誅罪論功을 하는 것도 너무 정도에 넘치여서 鄭仁弘, 李爾瞻등 大北의 巨頭와 柳希奮, 朴承宗등 小北의 巨頭는 물론이고 名色 大小北派에 조금이라도 간여가 잇는 사람이면 죄의 유무를 막론하고 一並殺戮하거나 또는 流竄식히여 그 慘狀은 光海朝, 李爾瞻, 鄭仁弘등 用事시대보다 더 심한 일이 만엇고 또 反正의 功을 論하는 者도 金瑬, 李貴이하 54人의 西人은 다 靖社功臣에 參하야 상당한 勳爵을 탓스되 自黨이외의 사람은 비록 大功이 잇서도 그 다지 大勳高爵을 주지 안엇섯다. 그 중에 가장 한 例를 들어 말하자면 反正 당시에 일반 계획은 전혀 李适의 功이엿지만 그가 南人派엿기 때문에 (參判李陸의 後)反正에 新參한 것을 이유로 하야 이등 공신 제2인으로 漢城 判尹을 삼고 金瑬는 소위 首謨者로 擧事 당일에 約束 시간에 不參하야 大事가 거의 良貝하게 되엿스되 處罰은 문제도 업시 一等 功者가 되며 都監大將 李守一은 但히 內應의 小功이 잇슬 뿐이로되 2등공신 제1인으로 兵判을 삼어 李适을 감독케 하고 그 뒤 훈련원에서 反正祝賀宴을 할 때에도 李貴는 扈衛大將으로 北에 坐하고 金瑬는 擧義大將으로 貴의 上座에 坐케 하되 李适등은 東西의 下坐에 안게 하얏다. 이와가치 西人派가 專橫한 結果는 먼저 自派에서부터 分爭이 생겨서 所謂 功西(勳西), 淸西, 老西, 少西, 原黨, 洛漢黨, 山黨등 별의별 派爭이 다 생겨서 서로 爭鬪하고 서로 알륵하야 朝廷을 濁亂케 하고 李适을 賤待한 결과로 反正 翌年 甲子에 반란이 이러나서 仁祖가 公州까지 播遷하얏다가 幸히 亂을 平하얏스나 其黨韓明璉의 子 韓潤이 만주로 망명하야 降將姜弘立, 朴蘭英에게 그 一族이 被殺하얏다. 誣言하야 姜朴兩人이 淸主를 勸하야 丁卯의 胡亂을 起케 하고 且反正 初에 平安監司 朴曄을 誅한 影響으로 國境의 武備가 해이하야 丁卯에 淸兵이 國內를 無人의 境과가치 入寇하고 (朴曄이 平安監司 시대에는 國境警備를 엄히 한 까닭에 胡人이 國境을 致近치 못하얏는데 그가 臨死時에 人에게 語하야 曰 我의 생명은 可惜할 것이 업스나 我가 死하면 以後 胡亂이 可畏타 하얏다.) 또 反正 後 未幾에 江原道 橫城에서는 學者 李仁居가 西人의 跋扈를 憤慨하야 柳希奮의 侄 柳孝立등의 大北殘黨을 모아 가지고 光海復位運動을 하다가 결국 失敗하얏스나 당시 西人派 反正 大臣들의 行事가 너무 偏狹專橫하엿던 것을 想知할 수 잇는 것이다.＜178＞
