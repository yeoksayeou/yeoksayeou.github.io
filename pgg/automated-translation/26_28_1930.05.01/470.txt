Stories of Experiencing the Donghak Peasant Revolution
						壽春山人

The First Outbreak of the Pyongsin Righteous Army Rebellion

In the sixth month of Eulmi Year, or January of the first year of Geonyang, the Righteous Army rebellion in Chuncheon, Gangwon Province, was the first of its kind in modern Korea and quite significant. Though I was only nine years old at the time, the impression was so deeply etched that it seems to appear before my eyes even now. The leader of that Righteous Army was Jeong In-hoe, my older brother, who was 27 years old at the time. He was originally a man of great ambition and a generous scholar. Seeing the country's affairs worsening day by day, he was always filled with indignation and lamentation. When the Queen Min Incident (閔妃被害事件) suddenly occurred on August 20th of Eulmi Year, he became even more enraged. He resolved to condemn and punish the pro-Japanese Kim Hong-jip Cabinet (金弘集內閣) and the Japanese involved in the incident. He secretly united with comrades and was making plans when the edict to cut the hair (斷髮令) was issued that sixth month, causing great unrest in the hearts of the people in both the capital and the countryside. In particular, the Chuncheon Governor (春川觀察使) Lee and Secretary (參書官) Jeong…

Only empty government buildings remained, so they occupied the county office (郡衙) and made it the headquarters of the Righteous Army. The sergeant (哨官) Park had already lost the support of the soldiers, and because he had cut his hair first, he was immediately dragged before the army, beheaded, and his head hung on the Hongmun gate. Former Magistrate Min was not only corrupt and oppressive to the people during his tenure but also a relative of Queen Min who had mismanaged state affairs. Therefore, they set fire to his so-called shrine (生祠堂) in the town. They proclaimed a manifesto (檄文) with the three major slogans: "Revenge for the Queen Mother, Oppose Hair Cutting, Expel Foreigners (國母報■, 斷髮反對, 外人退逐)", and distributed it to the counties of Gwandong and the Gyeonggi area. They also posted notices everywhere to recruit civilian soldiers (民兵), and in just a few days, their numbers reached five or six thousand. Among them were Confucian scholars (儒學者) in their robes and hats, merchants wearing felt hats, mountain hunters (山獵砲手) with yellow headscarves and carrying 망태 [mangtae], and farmers with wooden guns (木槍) and hazel bows (나무활). Jeong thought it would be better to find someone older, more virtuous, and more respected in the region to be the commander (大將), rather than lead the people himself, even though he had started the uprising. After consulting with the army, they invited Lee So-eung, who was quite famous as a Confucian scholar in Chuncheon at the time, to be the commander. Jeong himself and Seong Park became the staff officers (參謀). They gathered for a memorial service (祭增) on Bongui Mountain (鳳儀山), the guardian mountain of Chuncheon.

<169>

They performed an oath-swearing ceremony (擧義誓天祭) and levied military provisions from the wealthy in each district, piling up food like a mountain. They opened the armory (軍庫) to give weapons to the general soldiers (一般民兵) and trained them day and night.

Although I was young at the time, I was so fond of watching the many people carrying guns and gathering energetically that I almost completely stopped reading books and went to the town (邑) every day to watch them. (Our house was about seven li from the town.) The most memorable things were the head of Sergeant Park hanging on the Hongmun gate like Kim Saeng's head, the burning of Min's shrine, and the soldiers entering and scattering the household goods with random knives. They also poured feces and urine into dozens of kimchi pots (김칫독) and sauce jars (장항아리). It is still fascinating to think about how brave and fearsome the farmers, who were usually as gentle and speechless as lambs, were at that time.

Shooting the Royal Emissary Jo In-seung to Death

When this news reached the capital (京城), the government appointed Jo In-seung as the Chuncheon Governor (春川觀察使) and Royal Emissary (宣諭使) and sent him to Chuncheon. Although he volunteered to come from Seoul, he heard the news as far as Gapyeong (加平).

<170>

The situation was so urgent that he dared not enter Chuncheon and stayed in Gapyeong for several days, observing the situation. However, the Righteous Army, having learned of his arrival, attacked Gapyeong with a branch of their army and captured Jo In-seung, his staff, and Shin Jeong-man, a wealthy man from Gapyeong who was hosting him, as easily as catching rats in a bag. The day they brought him back was truly a spectacle. Like a triumphant return from a great victory, the soldiers were excited and joyful, and the men, women, old, and young of the town (邑) and village (村) shouted, "We've caught the traitor (逆賊)!" and "We've caught the 개화 [gae-hwa-kkeut]!" as they gathered to watch, forming a sea of people. The soldiers took his party to the Chuncheon town (邑) riverbank (압개뭇개) (the former execution ground) and surrounded them. After a while, an officer (軍官) carrying the Righteous Army commander's death sentence came and read it to Jo. He said that his seal of office (印緩官服) belonged to the state and could not be handled carelessly, so he had the soldiers take it away. Of the ten or so people in the group, the attendants (隨行員) and servants (下隷) were released, and Jo and Shin were tied up and made to kneel. Then, dozens of soldiers were ordered to fire at once. In just one or two shots, the figures of the two men were hidden in the gunpowder smoke, and only the flashes of light

<171>

were visible. Then, the soldiers returned to the town (邑), and the bodies were covered with straw mats and left on the sand. The next day, I went with a soldier (兵丁) from my neighborhood and saw that the bodies were unrecognizable, and the clothes were all burned and full of holes. Even then, I thought it was too cruel, and if they were going to kill a person, one or two shots would have been enough, but why did dozens of people fire dozens of times? And if they had already killed the person, they should have collected the body and buried it. How could they do such a thing while calling themselves the Righteous Army (義兵)? Thinking about it still makes my hair stand on end.

A Long Snake Formation Spanning Fifty Li

After that, as the Righteous Army grew stronger, they planned to attack the capital (京城) in one fell swoop, choosing the first day of the second lunar month. The scene at that time was truly spectacular. Although there were many people, they were originally an untrained mob (烏合之衆), so the ranks were not organized, and the clothes were of all kinds. The nominal commander (名色大將) rode in a four-man palanquin (四人轎) with a 㠖冠 [oe-gwan] and 博滯 [bak-tae], receiving daily wages (日率), and soldiers (兵丁) and artillerymen (砲手) guarded him in the front and back. Other officers (將校) mostly rode horses, mules, and donkeys, etc.

<172>

Among them, there were the most donkeys. When they brayed, you could hear "" here and "" there. Their feet were like 성앙갓흥긔 [seong-ang-ttae-gat-heung-gwi]. They carried奇奇 [gi-gi] signs with odd characters written on them such as "Punish the Traitors, Revenge the Queen Mother, Repel the Westerners and Japanese, Refuse to Cut Hair (國賊討伐, 國母報酬, 排洋斥倭, 斬髮不服)". The sound of the fanfare (라팔복), samhyeonyukkak (삼현六角), etc., at the front shook the heavens and the earth, and the spears (槍劔) mocked the sun and moon. From the soldiers (軍兵) to the packhorses (馬駄) carrying supplies, the numbers were so great that they formed a line of five, six, seven, or even eight people abreast from Chuncheon town (春川邑) to the Gapyeong county (加平郡) boundary. Judging by the momentum, it seemed they could conquer not only Seoul but the entire world. But as it turned out, when they reached Gapyeong town (加平邑), the punitive force (討伐隊) (the so-called Royal Army (京軍), a new-style army dispatched by the government) had already arrived from Seoul and occupied Gapyeong town (加平邑). Hearing this, the Righteous Army could not advance and occupied Mt. Beoreop (벌업山), a mountain in front of Gapyeong town (加平邑前山), confronting each other. On the first day, the Royal Army (京軍) could not do anything because the Righteous Army (義兵) was strong, and they just fired cannons and defended themselves. But on the next day, unfortunately, it rained heavily. Even then, the Righteous Army (義兵) did not yet have modern guns (新式銃) and only had old-fashioned matchlock guns (火繩銃).

<173>

These matchlock guns required multiple steps to fire, and even then, the gunpowder would not ignite in the rain, making it impossible to fire. Knowing the weakness of the Righteous Army (義兵), the Royal Army (京軍) took advantage of the rain and attacked from the foot of Mt. Beoreop (벌업山), firing upward. How could the untrained and poorly armed Righteous Army (義兵) withstand them? As the vanguard began to lose, the entire army scattered and fled. However, the Royal Army (京兵) did not pursue them because they were small in number, so fortunately, there were not many casualties. At that time, this Arirang song (아리랑타령) was popular in Chuncheon:

Goodbye, Bongui Mountain (鳳儀山) of Chuncheon (春川)!
The ferry at Sinjeong River (新廷江) is saying farewell.
Wearing 귀약통납 [gwi-yak-tong-nap], carrying 양총 [yang-chong]
We won the battle at Mt. Beoreop (벌업山)!
When my parents raised me
They said I would be General Seong (成大將)!

This, of course, meant that the Righteous Army (義兵) had been defeated by the Royal Army (京軍), and that Commander Seong (成氏) had been reckless. After that, the Righteous Army (義兵) retreated to Chuncheon, but they were defeated in a night attack by the Royal Army (京兵) behind the mountain behind Yaksa-won (藥司院) (a mountain in front of Chuncheon town (春川邑前山)). Jeong (鄭氏) and several members of the Righteous Army (義兵) went to the Yeongdong (嶺東) and Chungcheong (忠淸道) regions and caused disturbances with the Righteous Armies (義兵) of each province for a while.

나는 그에 비록나희가어리엿스나 그여러사람들이 총을메이고 活氣잇게모혀다니는 것이 엇지나조왓던지 글읽는 것을 全廢하다십히하고 每日 邑中에드러가서 그구경을하얏다.(우리집에서 邑이 約七里는된다)그중에도 第一인상이 깁흔 것은 우에말한 朴哨官의 머리를 紅門우에 김생의 모가지 모양으로 비혀단것과 閔氏의 生祠堂집을 불질으고 軍隊들이드러가서 亂刀로 그집세간을 散散이 破毁하고 數十余독되는 김칫독과 장항아리에다 과 오줌을 막우누엇던 것이다. 그리고 平素에 柔羊과가치 柔順하고 말한마듸도못하는 農民들이 그에는 엇지 그럿케 勇敢스럽고 무섭던지 只今생각하야도 興味가매우잇다.
宣諭使曺寅承을 銃殺
이 所聞이 京城에올나오니 그 政府에서는 曺寅承으로 春川觀察使兼宣諭使를 삼어 春川에오게다. 그는 서울에서는 勿論自願하고왓다고하지만은 加平지와＜170＞서 所聞을 도르니 形勢가 甚히 急險함으로 春川境內에는 敢히드러서지 못하고 加平邑에서 몃칠을 두류하며 形勢를 觀望하얏다. 그러나 그 消息을 먼저안 義兵은 一지枝의 軍으로 加平을 襲入하야 趙寅承以下一般隨員과 그를 留宿식히던 加平豪吏申正萬을 자루속에들은쥐잡덧이 잡아왓섯다 그를 잡아오던날이야말로 참 壯觀이엿다. 무슨큰 大勝捷의 凱旋하는날과 가치 各軍人들이 억개바람이나서 喜氣滿滿하게 놀고도라다님은 勿論이고 邑村의 男女老少들은 逆賊놈을잡아오너니 開化을잡아오너니하고 드며 人山人海가 되어 구경들을 갓섯다. 軍人들은 그의 一行을잡아다가 春川邑압개뭇개(前日斬刑場)沙場에다놋코는 에웍싸고잇더니 조금잇다가 義兵大將의 死刑宣告文을 가진 엇던 軍官이와서 趙氏에게 向하야 朗讀하고 그의 印緩官服은 國家의것이닛가 함부루 굴수업다하고 軍兵을식혀다 거두게하고 一行十餘人中에 隨行員과 下隷는다 放送하고 曺氏와 申氏는 결박하야안처노흔 다음에 數十名의 軍兵을 呼令하야 一時射擊하니 不過一二방에 두사람의 形體는 火藥煙氣에 싸혀서 뵈이지도안코 火光만＜171＞번적번적하얏섯다. 그리고는 軍兵들은다시 邑으로도라가고 그 屍體는 거적을덥허서 그냥 沙場에버리엿섯다. 그다음날에 나는 한 洞里에사는 兵丁과가치가다가 자서이보니 그 屍體는 形容도업시되고 衣服은모도 불에타서 구멍이뒤숭뒤숭러젓다. 그생각에도 그것은 너무 殘虐한 짓이오  사람을 죽일터이면 한두방초도 될터인데 저럿케 數十人이 몃十번의 放統을하는 것은 무슨닭이며  사람을 旣往죽엿스면 屍體나 收歛을하야 파무더줄 것이지 이름이 義兵이라면서 저런일을 엇지하나 하얏섯다. 그생각을하면 지금지도 머리이 쥐하다.
五十里를 連亘하는 長蛇陣
그뒤에 義兵들은 形勢가더욱커지매 一擧에 京城을 襲擊하랴고 陰腐二月一日를 卜하야 京城을 向해 出發하얏다. 그의 光景이야말로 참으로 壯觀이엿다. 人數가아모리만치만은 元來馴練이업는 烏合之衆인 닭에 行伍가 整頓되지못한 것은 勿論이고 服色도 形形色色이엿다. 名色大將은 㠖冠 博滯로 四人轎에 日率을밧고 압뒤에 兵丁과 砲手가 擁護하고가며 其外將校는대개 말과, 노새, 당나귀等을 탓는데＜172＞ 그중 당나귀가 第一만어서 울이면 이곳에서도『』저곳에서도 『』하고 긧발은맛치 성앙갓흥긔에다 國賊討伐, 國母報酬, 排洋斥倭, 斬髮不服等 奇奇文字를써서들엇고 압헤는 라팔복, 삼현六角等을 다리며 나아가니 소리가 天地를 震動하고 槍劔은 日月을희롱하얏다 軍兵을 爲始하야 運粮하는 馬駄지 엇지 數가만허던지 春川邑에서 五六乃至七八人식 一列을지은 것이 加平郡境氣勢로말하면 서울은 그만두고 天下라도 다집어칠것갓텃다. 그러나 웬걸이요 加平邑에 건자다다르니 벌서서울에서 討伐隊(所謂京軍인데 卽政府에서 派送한 新式軍隊)가 다러와서 加平邑을 占據하고잇다. 義兵은 그말을듯고 그대로 進軍치못하고 加平邑前山 -벌업山-에 占據하고 서로 對抗하얏섯다. 첫날에는 元來義兵의 勢가 强한닭에 京軍이 작도못하고 그저 放砲를하며 示威防禦만할이러니 그잇튼날은 마츰일이 아니되랴고 큰비가왓섯다 그만하야도 義兵들은 아즉지 新式銃이업고 舊式의 火繩銃만가젓섯는데 이 火繩銃은 손이여러＜173＞번가야 놋는中에도 비만오면 火藥에 불이붓지안어서 到底히 放銃을못하는터이라. 京軍은 義兵의 그 弱點을알고 비오는 機會를타서 벌업山밋해서부터 放銃을하며 仰攻하니 訓鍊업고 武器下院全한 義兵이 엇지당할수잇리오 先鋒이먼저 敗하기 始作하니 全軍이모도 望風逃走하얏다. 그러나 京兵은 元來 人數가적어서 敢히 追擊을 못한 닭에 多幸이 死傷은만치안엇섯다. 그 春川에는 이러한아리랑타령이 流行하얏섯다.
春川아 鳳儀山너잘잇거라
新廷江배터가하직일다
귀약통납날개양총을메고
벌업山接戰에 勝戰을햇네
우리나 父母가날길을제
成大將주자고날길넛다
이것은 勿論 當時義兵이 京軍에게 敗하고  先鋒將成氏의 無謀한 것을 意味함이엿다. 그뒤에 義兵은 다시 春川에 留屯하얏다가 京兵의 夜襲으로 藥司院(春川邑前山)뒤山에서 大敗하고 鄭氏와 여러 義兵들은 嶺東及忠淸道方面으로가서 各道의 義兵들과가치 한동안 擾動을이르켓섯다.(下略)＜174＞
