Magazine Title: 別乾坤
Publication Date: 1927년 07월 01일 (July 1, 1927)
Article Title: 讀者 謝告하나이다 (Apology to Readers)
Article Type: 사고·편집후기 (Notice/Editor's Postscript)

I apologize to the readers.

We are issuing the July issue after skipping over May and June, and I have nothing to say to our readers. We believed that you would understand our difficult situation, where we had to revise the editing three times, and we took solace in that. However, our hearts ached even more when we received letters urging us to publish the magazine.

The reason we couldn't reply immediately was that we believed it would be published soon, and we wanted to send the magazine before sending a reply.

By the time the publication was delayed even in mid-June and we had to edit it for the third time, we sent postcards one by one, but it seems that some were missed, so I apologize again here for our failure to send the postcards to all.

그러나 이즉 回答을드리지못한 것은 우리로도 곳 發行될줄로 밋고잇서 回答보다도 雜誌를 먼저 發送하려든 닭이엿슴니다.
