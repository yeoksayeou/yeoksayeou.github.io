Song of the Earth's Dark Spots
						Sanghwa

Even in the sun, believed to never change, dark spots appear—
--Will the world cool down easily, unknown even from summertime?--
Whether it's right or wrong, I worry along with it, but
Even on this precarious lump of earth where death and life play hide-and-seek,
Why is it that here, even the eyeless moonless night settles deeper,
Sorrowful lives—pitiful lives that cannot even live long—
What did they see, how could they live? Did they beat their breasts until they went mad?
Ah, human strength is insignificant, it scoffs insolently <23>
Worrying about the sun living way up in the ninety-thousand-layered high sky is indeed presumptuous.
Thinking one could live peacefully just digging the soil generation after generation—
--It was a long dream, bewitched by laughable goblins (독갑이)--
Knowing it, experiencing it, does it just seem ordinary?
If it's already night, at least stars like fireflies should come out,
Why is it that here, even suffocating clouds are layered thickly upon us?
Crying is useless—without the means to live properly even for a single day—
What can we believe in to forget? Will we just roll around on the ground and die?
Ah, the human heart has nothing to fear, thinking it's easily manageable,
Keeping that sky, which acts up so flippantly with a thousand kinds of fits, is truly frustrating <24>
<23-24>

**Summary**

This poem by Sanghwa expresses profound despair and hopelessness regarding a place metaphorically described as a "dark spot on Earth." It laments the suffering and shortened lives of the people living there, contrasting their plight with the distant, seemingly uncaring sun and heavens. The poem questions the meaning of existence in such conditions, dismisses human power as insignificant, and expresses frustration with fate or a capricious higher power, seeing past hopes as illusions caused by "goblins." For historians, the poem is a significant artifact of Korean colonial history, reflecting the deep sense of disillusionment, powerlessness, and suffering experienced under Japanese rule. Its bleak tone and metaphors of darkness and suffocation vividly convey the oppressive atmosphere of the era, making it a powerful piece of resistance literature.

地球黑點의 노래
						尙火
영영 변하지 안는다 밋든 해 속에도 검은 점이 돗처
--세상은 수이 식고 말려 녀름철부터 모르리라--
맛거나 말거나 덩따라 걱정은 하나마
죽음과 삶이 숨밧굼질하는 위태로운 땅덩이에서도
엇재 여게만은 눈빠진 금음밤조차 더 내려깔려
애닯은 목숨들이-길욱하게도 못살 가엽슨 목숨들이
무엇을 보고 엇지 살꼬 앙가슴을 뚜다리다 밋처나 보앗든가.
아 사람의 힘은 보잘 것 업다 건방지게 비웃고＜23＞
구만층 놉흔 한울로 올러가사는 해 걱정을 함이야말로 주제넘다
대대로 흙만 파먹으면 한갈가러 살려니 하든 것도
--웃으꽝스런 독갑이에게 홀런 긴 꿈이엇구나--
알어도 격거도 예사로 녀겨만 지는가
이미 밤이면 반듸불 가튼 별이나마 나와는 주어야지
엇재 여게만은 숨통막는 구름조차 또겁처끼여
울어도 쓸데업시-단 하로라도 살 듯 살어볼 꺼리업시
무엇을 밋고 니저볼꼬 땅바닥에 뒤궁글다 죽고나 말것인가
아 사람의 맘은 두릴 것 업다 만만하게 생각고
천가지 가즌 지랄로 잘까부리는 저 한울을 둠이야말로 속터진다＜24＞
＜23-24＞
