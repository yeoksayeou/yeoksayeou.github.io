Sijo
Yi Chŏng-bo

On a moonlit night by the Sosang River (瀟湘江), oh, returning wild goose,
How sorrowful must be the sound of the Xiang Spirit's (湘靈) *seul* playing (鼓瑟聲),
That even now, unable to bear the clear sorrow (淸怨), you cry out so?

Anonymous

From the branch laden with jujubes (大棗), swiftly plucking and gathering them,
From the branch where early chestnuts (早栗) ripen and burst open, shaking and gathering them,
I invite friends and enter the grass-thatched hut (草堂); there is wine filling the cask (有酒盈樽)!

Yu Cha-sin

The autumn mountain (秋山) carries the setting sun (夕陽) and sinks into the river's heart (江心),
Slinging one bamboo pole (一竿竹) over my shoulder, I sit in a small boat (小艇);
The Heavenly Duke (天公), seeing me at leisure (閑暇히), sends the moon along to follow.

Same Author

By the White Sand River (白沙江), near the red knotweed (紅蓼邊), oh, bobbing white gull (白鷗)!
Unable to fill your mouth and stomach (口腹), why do you bow so?
Even if one's body (一身) is at leisure (閑暇할진뎡), what use is getting fat (살쩌)?

Kim Kwang-uk

As the moon shines white (月白커늘) on the autumn river (秋江), I let a small skiff (一葉舟) drift and row,
Forcefully raising the pole, all the sleeping white gulls (白鷗) must be startled!
They too, caught up in human merriment, fly back and forth.

Same Author

Where the reed flowers (蘆花) bloom, floating athwart the setting glow (落霞),
In groups of threes and fives (三三五五히), oh, white gulls (白鷗) flying intermingled!
Shall we, too, seek out our old haunts by the rivers and lakes (江湖舊邊)?<35>

**Summary**

This article presents six Sijo, a traditional Korean verse form, by several poets including Yi Chŏng-bo, Yu Cha-sin, Kim Kwang-uk, and one anonymous author. The poems primarily focus on themes of nature, particularly autumnal scenes involving rivers, the moon, birds (wild geese, gulls), and the appreciation of leisure (閑暇). They evoke classical East Asian aesthetics, referencing the Sosang River and employing imagery common in traditional poetry, conveying sentiments of contemplation, detachment, and harmony with the natural world. From a historical perspective, the publication of these traditional Sijo poems in a popular magazine like *Pyŏlgŏn'gon* during the Japanese colonial period (1926) is significant. It demonstrates the persistence and appreciation of Korean literary traditions amidst colonial rule, serving as a subtle assertion of cultural identity. Historians might find it interesting as an example of cultural continuity and the potential use of traditional forms and nature themes as a space away from direct engagement with the political realities of the time.
