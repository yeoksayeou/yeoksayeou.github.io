Five Women in the World's Spotlight
						愚石生

Lady Astor, the First Female Member of Parliament in England

Among the women who have made their names known throughout the world in modern times, we must first count Lady Astor—Viscountess Astor—the British female politician, a Yankee woman, Nancy Langhorne, the first female Member of Parliament in England, who still holds a firm position in the political world.

Ideologically, she advocates liberalism; economically, she advocates rational labor unionism—to conservatives, she holds extreme socialist ideals; and on women's rights issues, she shouts for "absolute equality between men and women," and was elected as the first female member of parliament in conservative England.
She is not only the most prominent politician in her constituency, but also a key figure in the British House of Commons. It is even said that almost all important bills to be presented to the British House of Commons are shown to Teddy Astor in advance, and her opinion is sought. Moreover, whenever her Yankee spirit emerges in Parliament, her piercing, profound, and logically coherent questions, like stabbing the hearts of cabinet ministers, trigger a great upheaval in the assembly hall and even excite the general public.
Her name became widely known in this way, and especially because Yankee newspaper reporters trumpeted her name through international communication networks, she now occupies the firmly established position of the foremost female politician in Europe and America. However, rather than hearing her political opinions, we would like to hear what opinions this advocate of absolute equality between men and women holds regarding the relationship between men and women in the present and future. We would rather hear her opinion on this point.
Yankee woman Nancy Langhorne, wife of British nobleman Teddy Astor, said:
"In the past, men have created morals and laws based on male perspectives, oppressing women. Modern women cry for equality between men and women and seek to establish morals based on female perspectives. This is as unreasonable as men establishing morals based on their own perspectives."
"However, on the other hand, modern women, while denouncing the depravity of male sexual morality, tend to try to entice men with their own clothing and mental attitudes... This is a point for women to reflect on."
Indeed, despite being called a tomboy, Teddy Astor is said to have one of the most perfect families, which shows how womanly she is.
She is skilled in horsemanship and always plays tennis after lunch. She discusses politics, diplomacy, labor-management issues, and women's rights, foaming at the mouth and pounding the table with her fists like no other noblewoman, and her voice is like iron. However, she is overflowing with affection for young people and is called a mother among mothers. This is why she suits the nature of the British people, and why conservative politicians respect her progressive views.

Ms. Undset, the Female Literary Giant Who Received the Nobel Prize Last Year

The next modern woman to introduce is Sigrid Undset, the Norwegian female novelist who received the 1928 Nobel Prize in Literature along with French philosopher Henri Bergson, author of "Time and Free Will" and "Creative Evolution," on November 13 last year.
Although her fame may be limited to the literary world, I believe that no one will object to introducing her here, as it is worldwide.
She was born in 1880 in Christiania (now Oslo), the capital of Norway, and grew up there. Her father was an archaeologist whose name was known in the country, but his family was poor, so Undset had to pave her own way from the spring of her seventeenth year.
However, she received knowledge of archeology and history from her father and had considerable reading skills, so she diligently read novels and other books from ancient and modern times, and finally took up the pen and began writing novels. In 1907, when she was twenty-five years old, she published her debut novel, titled "Fru Marta Oulie" <121>.

This debut work was a modern novel with realistic tendencies, but it was commented on very noisily in the Norwegian literary world at the time. After publishing a collection of short stories and then, in 1911, publishing the famous "Jenny," which centered on a young girl and intertwined the struggles of love, the unique atmosphere of Northern European cities, and family life, she advanced to the upper echelons of the literary world. After publishing the trilogy "Kristin Lavransdatter" from 1920 to 1922, her name finally became known in the European literary world.
This great work depicts the life of a woman as a virgin, as a lover, as a mother, and as a widow, and it is a work in which Mrs. Undset herself has woven her deep observations and introspection on women over the past thirty years, expressing her feelings for women and advocating new ethics and beliefs.
According to critics, not only in this trilogy but in all of Undset's works, her characteristic lies in the intersection of religion, morality, and pure emotion, and because she is completely idealistic, it is only natural that the Nobel Prize in Literature, which is awarded to humanitarian works, was given to this woman.
■ In an era where novels that try to give morbid stimulation with ugliness, incest, and strangeness—so-called literary works—are rampant, the fact that Ms. Undset has received the Nobel Prize is very interesting.

Empress Marie Trying to Escape from the Court

The name of Empress Marie, the granddaughter of King George V of England, who became the Queen of Romania and is now the Regent of her grandson, Emperor Michael, is known in every corner of the world. Her deep, beautiful eyebrows, her dreamy yet wise-looking eyes, her perfectly flawless nose and Petit-esque mouth, and her full cheeks and graceful figure! A kind of dignity surrounds all this shining flesh! This is the primary reason why her name is known to the world.
Moreover, Empress Marie's literary talent is well-regarded in the world, and her talent is abundant in the essays and writings that she publishes in American newspapers from time to time, making her a favorite of Yankee girls. Her thoughts, which appear in her writings, are liberal, and her views on women are very progressive, so she can be seen as a woman of the new era trying to escape from the European court, which is immersed in ancient traditions and customs.

Empress Marie has abandoned the old ways since her actions. The time was just before the Romanian Emperor was in critical condition. The Empress was traveling in Canada and the United States at that time. When she went to the city of Pankoba in British Columbia, the mayor there held a grand welcoming party for the Empress (then Queen). The Empress wore a crown studded with diamonds like stars, wore shimmering silk and satin clothes, and slowly walked and sat on a Renaissance-style chair, crossing her legs on the chair and smoking a cigarette, causing the people lined up on either side to open their mouths. She was like a queen from a motion picture. The awkward dignity and the freedom to break traditions were combined to give the viewer a strange feeling, which is not unreasonable. At the time, it was said that Empress Marie would enter Hollywood and play the lead role in a movie, which probably came from this. It is rumored that this Empress is immersed in writing novels by wielding her pen, and if a novel written by this woman of the court, whose talent is exuberant and freely available, based on her experiences and thoughts, were to appear in the world, it would give people a strong surprise, and Empress Marie's name will be even more on people's lips.

Ms. Alexandra Kollontai, the First Female Minister Plenipotentiary

Next, I cannot but introduce Ms. Kollontai of Labor and Farmer Russia, who became the first female Minister Plenipotentiary as a woman. Ms. Kollontai's name has also become known to the world for dealing with the issue of sexuality with an extremely daring attitude in novels centered on women's issues. Everyone in Chosŏn who is well-rounded has probably read Ms. Kollontai's problem novels.
Alexandra Mikhailovna Kollontai was born in 1872, making her a grandmother of fifty-seven this year. After being educated in Russia, she went to Germany, graduated from the University of Zurich, and became a lecturer at a certain university in Poland, where she lectured on women's suffrage issues <123>.
After wandering around the United States and other countries for several years, she became a member of the Second International or a member of the Menshevik International, and finally returned to Russia in 1917. At that time, the Kerensky Cabinet was established, but Ms. Kollontai disliked the ideas of Kerensky's lukewarm policies and was imprisoned for her radical words and actions.
Soon after, Lenin's Great Revolution succeeded, and Ms. Kollontai was released from prison and became the People's Commissar for Social Welfare of the Labor and Peasant State, where she carried out great activities in the Crimea and Krajina regions until 1919.
Not long after, the Labor and Peasant Government, which always tries to do everything in a new way, sent Ms. Kollontai as the Minister Plenipotentiary to Norway, and later she was appointed as the Minister Plenipotentiary to Mexico for several years, and now she has been re-appointed as the Minister Plenipotentiary to Norway. When Ms. Kollontai crossed over to Mexico, she was rejected from passing through the United States because she was a dangerous person, and her unique and venomous remarks against the US authorities were reported in newspapers in various countries, and Ms. Kollontai's name naturally became famous.

Kollontai Grandmother entered her literary life around 1900, and she mainly dealt with women's issues. Moreover, because she was a genius in languages, being fluent in eight or nine languages, including Russian, English, French, German, Spanish, and Italian, she wrote in newspapers and magazines in every country she went to, so her literary name had been recognized in the world since her wandering days overseas.
Therefore, there are too many things she has written to list, but among them, the most well-known is "Love of Three Generations," which depicts the different loves of grandmothers, mothers, and daughters in an explicit way. The underlying idea in this novel is that "love and marriage are secondary matters in life for women, and their true vocation is social work." This idea is like the old thought in our country, "It is a disgrace for men to have women in their eyes; men must only place themselves in noble places," and it can be seen as an inversion of that thought from the woman's point of view.

Ms. Naidu, a Female Hero and Orator of the Modern Orient

Expressing pure poetic sentiment, clear critical power, and unwavering sense of justice with her fervent eloquence, Ms. Naidu, an Indian poet who captivated audiences in Europe and America from last summer to late autumn, is not only famous in the world, but also known in various countries as a politician and a great orator. She was born in 1879, making her fifty years old this year. She was called a child prodigy from an early age, and she passed the university entrance exam at the age of twelve. She always had excellent grades while in school. After graduating in 1895, when she was sixteen years old, she published a collection of poems and was recognized for her poetic talent in the British literary world, and after publishing several more collections of poems, she maintained a firm position in the English and American literary worlds.
She advocated free love early on, fought for the social and political advancement of women, and worked hard for the Indian women's liberation movement. On the other hand, she vehemently supported Mahatma Gandhi's non-cooperation movement, resisting the violent and unjust British politics in India, and delivered speeches everywhere.
Ms. Naidu's speeches are not only serious in attitude, clear in voice, certain in tone, and logical in reasoning, but also rich in poetic rhythm in her language, giving listeners a deep impression that is comparable to the old poet Tagore.

In this way, Ms. Naidu completely won the hearts of the Indian people and became an excellent politician. She soon became the Chairman of the Madras State Assembly, or was elected as the Chairman of the Indian National Congress, and was re-elected as the Mayor of Bombay (Mumbai), and is also working as a member of the agenda committee of the National Assembly. However, Ms. Naidu's efforts are not satisfied with success in the women's movement and the political world, and she is always working to unite and harmonize Hindus and Muslims for the ideal of Indian national independence, and I pray with tears that her efforts will succeed!
Ms. Naidu truly gained her current position and fame with her poetic talent, knowledge, and eloquence, and it is fundamentally different from the female politicians near the United States who are elected as governors or mayors in a temporary and playful mood by borrowing their husbands' names and on their husbands' foundations.

世界話頭의 五女性
						愚石生
英國最初의 女代議士 아스터―夫人

現代에잇서 그일흠을 天下에훗날니는 女性들 中에서 먼저 英國의 女流政治家인 양키―女 元난시―랑그포―ㄴ 卽 英國最初의 女國會議員으로 지금도오히려 政界에서 한목을단단히보는 아스터―夫人――아스터―子爵夫人―을 손꼽지안을수업다.

그는 思想上으로는 自由主義를 標榜하고 經濟上으로는 合理的의 勞動組合主義――保守主義者로서보면 極端의 社會主義의 理想을들고 女權問題에 이르러서는『男女絶對平等主義』를 呼唱하야 저 保守的인 英國에서 처음인 女議員으로 選出되엿다.
그는다만 그 選擧區域內에서 가장 政治家일더러 英國下院잇서서는 一方의 重鎭이다 英國下院에 上程할바 重要한 法案은 거의다―테듸―아스터―에게 미리보히고 그 意見을 求한다는말지잇다 그러고 그가 議會에서 양키―氣質이나오기만하면 國務大臣의 가슴을찌르는것가튼 痛烈深刻하고도 理議整然한 質問이 連發하야 議場에 大風雲을 니리키고 一般市民지도 昻奮을식여늦는다.
이와가티 그의일흠이 멀니알녀지케되엿는데 더구나 양키―新聞記者들이 國際的通信網을 通하야 그의일흠을 드러노흔닭에 그는 이제와서는 歐米女流政客의 第一人者의 革固한 地位를 占하고잇다. 그러나 우리는 그 女子의 政治上意見을 듯고십흐니보다 이 男女絶對平等論者가 現代와 將來의 男女關係에 엇더한 意見을 拘懷하고잇는가? 차라리 이 點에 對한 意見을 듯고십다.
양키―女子―난시․랑그포―ㄴ 英＜120＞國貴族의 妻 테듸―아스터―는 말하엿다.
『男性은 過去에잇서서 男性本位의 道德과 法律을지어서 女性을 壓迫하여왓다 現代女性은 男女平等을 絶叫하며 女性本位의 道德을 樹立하고저한다 그는마치 男性이 自己本位의 道德을 세운것과 同一한 不合理이다』
『그러나 一方에잇서서 現代女性은 男性의 性道德의 陋劣을 辱하는 一便 스스로 服裝과 밋 心的態度에잇서서 男性의마음을 을냐고하는 傾向이잇다……이것은 女性의 反省할 點이다』
果然 테듸―아스터―는 텀뽀―이(男性的女性)라는말을 듯는데도 不拘하고 그의 家庭가티 圓滿한 家庭은 업다는말을 듯는것을 미루어보아도 그가얼마나 女子답은 女子인것을 알수가잇다.
馬術에 能하고 午餐後에는 반드시 庭球를한다 그러고 政治를 論하고 外交를 論하고 勞資問題와 女權을 論하야 貴婦人으로서는 답지도안케 입에는 거품을물고 주먹으로는 卓子를두다리며 쇳소리(鐵城)가튼목을울린다 그러나 어린사람에게는 愛情이넘치여 어머니 中의 어머니라는말을 듯는다 이 點이 그가 英國人의 性質에 맛는것이고 그의 進步的인 意見이 保守的政客이 尊重히녁이는 所以이다.

昨年度노―벨 賞을바든 女文豪운트셋트 女史

다음에 紹介하여야할 現代의 女性은 昨年十一月十三日에 佛蘭西의 哲學者로『時와 自由意志』와『創造的進化』의 著者 반리․벨그손과한가지 一千九百二十八年度의 노―벨 文學賞을바든 諾威(노르웨이)의 女流小說家시그리트․운트세트女史라야 할것이다.
그의 名聲은비록 文學界에 局限되여잇다고하겟스나 그럿이 全世界的인 以上 누구나 女史를이에 紹介하는데 不服이업슬줄밋는다.
그는千八百八十年 諾威의 首都 크리스챠니아(只今의 오스로―)에서나어서 그곳에서 成長하엿다 그의 父親은 國內에서 그의일흠을알만한 考古學者이엿스나 家勢가 貧困하야서 운트세트는 변변히 敎育을밧지도못하고 十七歲의봄부터 自治의길을열지아느면 안이될 處地이엿다.
그러나 그는그의아버지로부터 考古學과 歷史의 智識을바더 相當한 讀書力이 잇섯는닭에 古今의 小說과 其他의 書冊을 熱心으로 讀破하야 드듸여 自己가붓을들고 小說을쓰게되엿다 그리하야 千九百七年 그가 二十五歲에 處女作『훌․말사․오브리―』라고 題하는 小說을 發表하＜121＞게되엿다.

이 處女作은 寫眞主義的傾向이잇는 現代的인 小說이엿스나 當時諾威文壇에서는 매우시럽게 評論을하엿섯다 그 後에 短篇集을내이고 다시 千九百十一年에이르러서 少女를 主人公으로하야 愛의 鬪爭과 北歐特有의 都會의 情調와 家庭의 生活을 經緯로한 有名한『옌니―』를 上梓한 後에 文壇의 上層에 進出하고 千九百二十年으로부터 二十二年동안에『크리스틴․라브란․스탓테ㄹ』라는 三部로된 大作을 世上에내여노흔뒤에 비로소 歐洲文壇에 그의 名聲이놉하지게되엿다.
이 大作은 一女性인 處女로서의 愛人으로서의 는 어머니로서의 寡婦로서의 生涯를 描出한것이며 그속에는 운트셋트夫人自身의 過去三十餘年에 瓦하야 女性에 關한 深刻한 觀察과 內省을짜어너흔 作品으로 一方으로는 女性을 爲하야 氣를 吐함과한가지 새로운맛이잇는 倫理와 信仰을 提唱한것이다.
評家의말에 조차보면 다만 이 三部作에잇서서 이아니라 운트셋트의 作品은 모다 宗敎와 道德과 純眞한 情感과의 서로 交錯된곳에 그의 特色이잇서 完全히 理想主義的임으로 人道的作品에 授與하는 노―벨文學賞이 이同女史의손에 쥐여젓다는것은 當然한일이라고하겟다.
■醜惡과 亂倫과 怪奇로 病的剌戟을주려는 小說――所謂文學的――이 橫行하는 現代에잇서서 이운트셋트女史가 노―벨賞을바덧다는 事實은 매우 興味잇는일이다.

宮廷에서 出脫하려는 마리―皇太后

英國皇帝쬬―지 五世의 從妹로 루―마니아 皇后가되엿다가 現在에는 그 孫子 미카엘皇帝의 攝政으로잇는 마리―皇太后의 일홈도 世界의구석구석이알녀저잇다 그의진(濃)하고 고흔눈섬과 꿈꾸는것가트나 賢明해보히는눈 完全無缺한코와 페티로―스가튼입모슴 그러고 豊艶한 兩頰 優美雅澹한 容姿! 이모든빗나는 肉體를 싸고잇는 一種의 威嚴! 이것이 그의 일홈이 세게에널니알녀진 第一의 要素이다.
그만이아니라 마리―皇太后의 文才도 世上에 正評이잇서 각금 米國新聞에 發表하는 論文隨筆等에도 그 才氣가 充溢하야 양키―껄들의 愛讀＜122＞하는바이다 그의글가온데 나타나는 그의 思想은 自由主義的이며 女性에 關한 見解도 매우 進步的이여서 마치 古風의 傳統과 習慣에잠혀잇는 歐洲의 宮廷에서 脫出하려는 新時代의 女性이라고 볼수가잇다.

마리―皇太后는 그 行動부터가 舊套를 罷脫하엿다 는마치 羅馬尼(루―마니아)先帝가 危篤한 病態에빠져잇든 바로 前이엿다 皇太后는 그 加奈와 合衆國을 旅行을하고잇섯다 英領커럼비아洲 팡크바―市에갓슬 그곳 市長이 皇太后(當時는 皇后)를 爲하야 盛大한 歡迎會를열엇섯다 皇太后는 金剛石을 별가티박은 寶冠을쓰고 綾羅錦綢의 번득어리는 衣裳을두르고 느럭느럭거러서 러네이썬스 式椅子에 거러안드니 椅子우에서 다리를쓰꼬으고안저 卷煙을퍽퍽피워서 左右에느러서잇는사람들로 하여곰 입을버리게하엿다한다 마치 活動寫眞에나오는 女王도가탓다한다 거북성스러운 尊嚴과 傳統打破의 自由로움이 한데합솔처서 보는사람으로하여 異常한 感을 주엇다는것도 無理아닌말이다 當時 마리―皇太后가 홀리우드에드러가서 一映畵의 主役을 演하겟다고 하엿다는말도 아마이러한곳에서 나온것갓다 이皇太后는 그 才筆을휘둘너 小說의 著作에 沒頭하고잇다는 所聞이들니나 才氣가 渙潑하고 自由調達한이 宮廷의 一女性이 其體驗과 思索을 基礎로하야쓸 小說이 한번 世上에나타나게 된다면 사람들에게 强度의 驚異을줄것이며 마리―皇太后의 일홈은 더욱 사람들의입테서 오를것이다.

最初의 特別全權女公使 알렉산드라․코론타이女史

다음에는 女子로서는 最初의 特命全權女公使가된 勞農露西亞의 코론타이女史를 紹介하지아니할수가업다. 女史는 한 婦人問題를 中心으로한 小說에 極히 大膽不敵한 態度로써 性問題를 取扱한데잇서서 그일홈이 世界에 알녀지게되엿다 朝鮮에서도원만한이는다 女史의問題의 小說를 읽엇슬것이다.
알렉산드라․미하이로―나․코론타이夫人은 千八百七十二年生이라하니 今年에 五十七歲되는 할머니가되엿다 할머니는 露西亞에서 敎育을바든 後 獨逸로가서 쓰―리쓰히 大學을 卒業하고 포론의 某大學의 講師가되여 婦人參政問題에 關한 講義를한일도 잇＜123＞섯다.
그 後米國 其他各國을 放浪하기를 몃 春秋에 或은 第二인터내수낼의 會員이되고 或은멘써빅․인터내수낼의 會員이되여 千九百十七年에 겨우 露西亞에도라갓다 當時케렌스키—內閣이 成立이되엿섯스나 女史는 微溫的인케렌스키—의 政策의 思想에 嫌惡를 눗기고 過激한 言動을한닭에 投獄을 當하엿섯다.
그 後얼마되지아니하여 레닌의 大革命運動이 成功을하야 女史는곳 出獄을하야 勞農露國社會救濟人民委員이되여 千九百十九年지 크리미야와 크라이나 地方에서 큰 活動을하엿다.
무슨일이고 새로운것으로만해보자는 勞農政府가 女史를 諾威特命全權大使로 보낸것은 그후얼마되지안이하여서의 일이고 그 後女史는 數年동안 墨西哥 駐剳公使로 任命되여서 數年동안 墨西哥에 在任하다가 現在에는 다시 諾威駐在公使로 任命되여잇다 女史가 墨國으로건너갈 當時에 危險人物이라하여 米國通過를 拒絶을 當한닭에 米國當局에 對하야 獨特한 毒舌을 배아튼것이 各國新聞에 報道되여 女史의일흠은 自然히 有名해젓다.

코론타이할머니가 文學的生涯로드러가기는 千九百年頃이며 主로 婦人問題를 取扱하야 더구나 露, 英, 佛, 獨, 西 伊等八九箇國語에 能通한 語學의 天才임으로 가는곳마다 그나라의 新聞雜誌에 執筆을하얏슴으로 海外放浪時代부터 그의 文名은 世界에서 認定하엿든것이다.
따라서 그가 著作한것은 枚擧에 오히려겨를이업슬만콤 만흐나 그 中에도 좃컨납부건 널니알녀진것은 할머니와 어머니와 딸의 各各相異한 戀愛를 露骨的으로 描出한『三代의 戀』이다 이 小說에 감초인 思想은『女性에게도 戀愛나 結婚이라는것은 人生의 餘事이며 眞正한 天職은 社會的事業이다』이러한 思想은 마치 우리나라의 往時의 思想과가타야『婦女子를 眼中에두는것은 男子의 恥辱이다 다못 男子는 스스로 高尙한곳에 處하지아느면 안될것이다』하는思想을 女性의 立場에서 逆用하는것이라고도 볼수가잇다.＜124＞

現代東洋의 女傑 雄辯家나잇스女史

純眞한 詩的情操와 明徹한 批判力과 不拔한 正義觀을 그 熱熱한 雄辯으로 表現하야 昨年녀름부터 晩秋에이르기지 歐米各國의 聽衆을 射殺식이려든 印度의 詩人으로서 世界에 유명할아니라 政治家로  大雄辯家로 그일홈이 各國에알녀저잇는나잇스女史 그는 千八百七十九年生이라함으로 今年에 五十歲이다 어려서부터 神童이라는말을드르니만큼 겨우十二歲에 大學入學試驗에 及第하여 在學中에도 늘 優秀한 成績으로잇다 卒業한 後 千八百九十五年生 그가 十六歲에 詩集을 上梓하야 英國文壇에 그詩才를 認定을밧고 그후 數篇의 詩集을내여 英米文壇에 確固한 位置를 保持하게되엿다.
일즉이 自由戀愛를 高唱하야 女性의 社會的․政治的進出을 爲하야 싸호고 더욱이 印度婦人解放運動에 努力하며 一方으로 暴戾不道한 英國의 印度政治에 反抗하야 聖子깐듸―의 非協調運動에 熱心한 贊意를 가지고 到處에서 雄辯을 吐하엿다.
나잇스女史의 演說은 그 態度가 嚴肅하고 音聲이 明朗하고 口調가 確實하고 論理가 整然할아니라 그 用語는 詩的音律이 豊富하야 듯는 者로하여금 甚深한 感銘을밧는것이 老詩人 타고―르에 匹敵한다고한다.

이리하야 나잇스女史는 完全히 印度民衆의마음을 온몸에을어 훌융한 政治家가되고마럿다 곳 마드리스 州議會의 議長이되고 는 印度國民議會會長으로 被選되여 다시 孟買(품페이)市 市長으로 選擧되고  國民議會의 議題委員으로 活動을하고잇다 그러나 나잇스女史努力은 單只婦人運動과 政界에잇서 成功에 滿足하지안코 늘 印度民族獨立의 理想을 爲하야 印度敎徒와 回回敎徒를 結合融和식히고저 努力하는 事實은 눈물을먹음고 그의努力이 成功하기를 祝수할바이다!
女史는 實로 그 詩才와 識見과 雄辯으로써 今日의 地位와 名聲을내든것이고 決코 米國近處의 女政治家가 男便의일홈을빌고 男便의 地盤에서 一時遊戱的氣分으로 選擧되여서 知事나 市長이되는것가튼것과는 그 根本부터 다른것이다. (愚石生)＜125＞
