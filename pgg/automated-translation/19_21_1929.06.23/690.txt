첫녀름(斷想) (First Summer - Musings)
方漢旻
문예기타 (Literature - Miscellaneous)

Summer has already arrived. A world of new green has opened. The cherry blossoms of Ch’anggyŏngwŏn, which drove hundreds of thousands of idle class men and women into ecstasy, seem to have faded from people's memories now. After a wave of white clouds in the sky and green shade on the ground, amidst the dark, sweltering breeze and the scent of earth forming the atmosphere of the season, the spreading leaves of the poplar tree pour emerald oil over their entire expanse. I foresee that the scene of a cicada chirping on a pine tree will not be far off.

Summer has come.
The season for all things to grow and develop has come. From now on, the world will begin to grow—people, animals, trees, and grass—I am happy—I, who had fallen into silence, cannot help but smile. Thinking of the days in winter when I did nothing but sleep in my room, and remembering being cryogenically frozen alive in the frigid air that read fifteen or sixteen degrees below zero for twenty-four hours a day, summer feels like it has come just for me—I feel it deeply.

Ah! The people shivering under the mats at the corner of Chonggak, the people playing *ssangbawi* (쌍봐) under the Kyŏngsŏng Municipal Government bulletin board—where have they gone? (They were not opium addicts.) I want to grab their wrists and shout out the joy of summer together.
Ah! Summer has come. The large, round sun throws so much heat onto the earth that it could boil the waters of the Pacific Ocean. Oh, I am happy. Everything grows rapidly. The blood in my heart boils and races through my thin blood vessels.

However, even if spring goes and summer comes, what change will there be in the relationship between people or the relationship of ◯◯××? No, the longer the days get, the more the ×× hours seem to extend. The merciless usurers will only rush to suck the weakened blood of the millions of starving people—the sweat of the factory workers flowing down will only double. Hearing the panting of my *illyŏkch’abu* (人力車夫 - rickshaw man) returning from Int’ŏbuk on the hill between Ŭidae (醫大 - Medical College) and the University Hospital, I immediately jumped out. I did not have the courage to look him in the face! I am a sinner. Why can't I do my true best under the long summer days' oppressive sunlight?

(1929, 5, 7, as felt late, not even organized) <162>

첫녀름(斷想)
						方漢旻
벌서첫녀름이왓다. 新綠의 世界가열니엿다. 數十萬有閑階級의 男女를 熱狂케하든 昌慶苑의뻣나무꼿도 이제는사람사람의 記憶에서 사라저바린모양. 하날에는 白雲 따에는 綠陰期가한번나리인뒤으로 흑군흑군한바람과 흙내음새가 期節의 雰圍氣를이루운가운대 포푸라나무널다른입새가 翠綠의기름을 全幅에흘닌다 松上一蟬鳴의 情境이버러질것도 압흐로머지안니한것을본다.

녀름이왓다.―
모든 것이 成長하고 發育하는씨―슨이왓다. 世界는이로부터 크기시작할것이다사람이나 動物이나 나무나 풀이나―깃브다―沈爵에빠진나도 한번웃지아늘수없다 겨울날마루방에서는것업시자든일을생각하고―하로 二十四時間零下十五六度를가르치는찬 空氣속에서 生으로 冷藏을 當햇든걸생각하면 녀름은내것가티나를위하야온것가티―눗겨진다.
아! 鍾閣모퉁이거적속에서 든사람 京城府揭示板미테서쌍봐를치든사람―그들은어데로갓슬가?(그들은아편장이는아니엿다) 나는그들의손목을잡고한가지녀름의 歡喜를부르짓고십다.
아! 녀름이왓다. 크고둥그른 太陽이 太平洋물을 沸騰식힐만콤 多量의 熱을 大地우에던진다 오 깃브다. 모―든것은무럭무럭큰다. 내 心藏의피가부글부글끌어가늘은 血管을다름질한다.

그러나 봄이가고녀름이온대야 사람과사람의 關係◯◯××關係에무슨 變動이잇스랴? 아니다 해가길면길사록××時間이 延長되는모양. 무서운 高利貸金業者땀는 數百萬飢民의쇠약한피를빨기에 奔走할이니―철철히흐르는 工場勞動者의 땀은 오히려갑절이나흐른다. 인터북―에서도라오는나의 人力車夫가 醫大―大學病院間의언덕우에서헐덕거리는소래를듯고 나는곳뛰여나렷다. 나는 正面으로그의얼골을볼 勇氣가업섯다! 나는 罪人이다. 길고긴녀름날앗가운햇벗아래서 왜참된노력을다―하저못하는가?
