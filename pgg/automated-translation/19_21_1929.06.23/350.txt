If I were to give more examples, it would be endless, but I believe this much shows the name of the Youth Government. Among the above, only T'an Yen-k'ai is over 50 years old. Among all the Central Committee members, only Wu Chih* (吳稚*)(65), Lin Chin (林禁)(67), Ts'ai Yuan-p'ei (蔡元培)(60), and Chao Tsai-wen (趙載文)(62) are over 60, and Chang Ching-chiang (張靜江) is 56. The fact that the rest are all in their 30s or 40s shows the face of youth in China more than anything else. Again, if we randomly copy two or three counties from the announced statistics of party members, since the total statistics have not been released:

Paoshan County (寶山縣), Kiangsi Province (354 party members)
Age Range    Number of People    %
15-19          34                9.01
20-24          75               19.88
25-29          93               24.65
30-34          90               23.85
35-39          32                8.48
40-44          24                6.36
45-           6                1.59

In other words, even if we combine those over 30, it only accounts for 15% of the total.

Haimen County (海門縣), Kiangsu Province (493 party members)
Age Range    Number of People    %
15-19          86               17.44
20-24         139               28.22
25-29         126               26.58
30-34          71               14.41
35-39          30                6.09
40-44          41                8.32
45-           0                0.00

There are no people over 40, and those over 35 account for about 15% - the same as before.

Nanking Special City Party Headquarters (南京特別市黨部) (2727 party members)
Age Range     Number of People
15-20            765
21-25            980
26-30            811
31-35            346
36-40            275
41-45             92
45-50             56
51-55             14
56-                6

I leave the calculation of the percentages in this statistic to the readers. Even though the number of party members over 40 is larger because it is the location of the central government, it still barely exceeds 1/7 of the total.<74>

예를 들자면 한이 업겟거니와 이만하면 靑年政府의 名色이 나타난 줄로 안다. 以上中에 50세 이상은 譯延闓 하나 박게 업거니와 中央委員 전부를 통하야 60세 이상이 吳稚*(65) 林禁(67) 蔡元培(60) 趙載文(62) 뿐이요 張靜江이 56세일 뿐이다. 기타 전부가 30대 혹은 40대인 것은 무엇보다도 청년 중국의 면목을 나타낸다. 다시 시험으로 당원 통계는 발표된 것이 업스니까 발표된 자중에서 임의로 二, 三縣을 抄記하면
江西省寶山縣 (黨員 354 명)
연령         인수       %
15-19        34        9.01
20-24        75       19.88
25-29        93       24.65
30-34        90       23.85
35-39        32        8.48
40-44        24        6.36
45-           6        1.59

즉 30 이상을 다시 합하야도 전체의 1할 5분 박게 안이 된다.

江蘇省海門縣 (黨員 493 명)
연령         원수      %
15-19        86       17.44
20-24       139       28.22
25-29       126       26.58
30-34        71       14.41
35-39        30        6.09
40-44        41        8.32
45-           0        0.00

40세 이상은 1인도 업고 35세 이상이 약 1할 5분-前과 갓다.

南京特別市黨部 (黨員 2727 명)
연령             원수
15-20            765
21-25            980
26-30            811
31-35            346
36-40            275
41-45             92
45-50             56
51-55             14
56-                6

이 통계의 백분비는 독자 諸軍의 自作 算出에 막겨둔다. 오직 40세 이상의 당원이 중앙정부 소재지니 만치 다수나 그래도 겨오 전체의 7분에 지나지 못한다.<74>
