The Story of Dano, the Day of Great Fortune
						Ch'ŏng-o

◇What kind of holiday is Dano?

The bright red cherries, like the pretty lips of a sixteen-year-old girl, are kissing the shop counters, and the pomegranate flowers, like children's toys, are beckoning the late bees and butterflies with their bright smiles. It seems that this year's Dano is not far away. Dano is one of Korea's three major holidays. From ancient times, people in Seoul and the countryside alike have worn new clothes, eaten delicious food, swung on swings (ch'uch'ŏn (鞦韆)), wrestled (only for men), and enjoyed themselves in this great holiday.

It is said that the origin of this Dano holiday began in southern China. According to tradition, during the Warring States period in ancient China, Qu Yuan (屈原), a loyal minister and famous writer of the state of Chu, was falsely accused by treacherous officials and exiled to Ch'angsa (長沙). There, he wrote famous works such as the "Li Sao Jing" (離騷經) and "Fisherman's Song" (漁父辭), and became pessimistic about the world. On May 5th, he drowned himself in the Miluo River (汨羅水). The people of his country mourned and pitied him, so every year on May 5th, they went to the Miluo River to perform ancestral rites for him. This became a custom and a holiday. Whether the custom originated in that way or in another way is not known in detail, but it is a fact that it originated in China. As for when Koreans began to celebrate that day as a holiday, I am unfamiliar with the archaeology of customs, so I cannot say for sure. However, the history that Kyŏnhwŏn (甄萱), the king of Later Paekche, was born on Dano in May at the end of the Silla Dynasty and was abandoned because it was considered unlucky suggests that the custom of Dano had already entered Korea during the Three Kingdoms period. <138>

What is the meaning of the word Dano? According to ancient Chinese records (P'ungt'ogi (風土記)), the character "tan (端)" has the same meaning as the character "si (始, beginning)", and the character "o (午)" is the same as the character "o (五, five)". In ancient China, the Xia dynasty regarded the month of in (寅) as the first month of the year, so May was also called O month (午月), and therefore the fifth day was called O day (午日). So, the word Dano is the same as the word the 5th day of the month. In Korea, however, only May 5th is known as Dano, but in China, there are cases where the fifth day of other months is also called Dano. For example, Tang Hyŏnjong (唐玄宗) was born on August 5th, and the records of that time say, "The month is mid-autumn, and the day is Dano (月惟仲秋에 日在端午)." (Chang Sŏl Taeyŏllyŏksŏ (張說大衍曆序)). Dano is also called Chung'o (重午), Susaenal (水瀨日) (commonly known as Sŏngŭinal (成衣日)), or Ch'ŏnjungjigajŏl (天中之佳節). The word Chung'o is an abbreviation of "O O (午午)," meaning five-five, similar to calling September 9th Chungyang (重陽). It is said that Susaenal is another name because the people of southern China performed ancestral rites for Qu Yuan on May 5th at the rapids (瀨). According to ancient Chinese records (e.g., Cheyoro (提要錄)), Ch'ŏnjungjigajŏl means Ch'ŏnjungjŏl (天中節), which is May 5th at noon, because May 5th at noon is the exact midpoint of the movement of the sky.

◇Dano and Korean Songs and Customs

"On the pine tree, hang a swing high on the swaying branches. Green-clad, red-skirted beauties swing back and forth on the ch'uch'ŏn (鞦韆), but where have our parents gone, that they do not know the season of Dano…?" This song can be called the most representative song about Dano. The verses of the song are found in the short songs of the southern provinces, the ch'usimga (愁心歌) of the western provinces, and the sach'in'ga (思親歌) that was popular in Seoul in the old days. Besides these, there are many poems and children's songs about Dano.

However, I will not elaborate on them. As for customs related to Dano, as Dano is one of Korea's three major holidays, there are many strange customs throughout the country. First, regarding what was done in the royal court in the old days, it was an annual event to hold an ŏngdoch'arye (櫻桃茶禮, cherry ancestral rite) at the Chongmyo (宗廟) and for the court officials to pay their respects. The Ministry of Public Works and the magistrates of each province presented folding fans (jŏlsŏn (節扇)) and seasonal products (sisiik (時食), such as cherries and pomfrets). The Naewŏn (內醫院, royal pharmacy) offered t'arakt'ang (駝酪湯, milk porridge) (sŏnghot'ang (醒醐湯)), and the Kwansanggam (觀象監, astronomy office) presented a talisman (pujŏk (符籍)) with forty-two characters written in red on yellow paper: "May 5th, a day of great fortune, may you receive heavenly blessings above and earthly blessings below. The god Ch'iyu (蚩尤), with his copper head and iron body, red mouth and red tongue, may the four hundred and four diseases be extinguished at once, quickly, quickly, as the law commands (五月五日, 天中之佳節, 上得天福, 下得地福, 蚩尤之神, 銅頭鐵身, 赤口赤舌, 四百四病, 一時消滅, 急急如律令)." This talisman was attached to the lintels of each palace gate. This was similar to the Chinese custom of preventing diseases on Dano by making and placing peach wood talismans or colorful silk talismans on doors and screens, stemming from the superstition of preventing diseases. In the palace, the king bestowed folding fans and seasonal goods to close officials and relatives. Also, <139> tiger made of mugwort (ssuk (艾)) was given to the gaksin (閣臣) to wear on the head of the women in their houses, which also meant warding off evil spirits (pyŏksa (辟邪)). There was a similar custom in China, as can be seen in the ancient poems "A mugwort tiger on the head wards off all evil (銰頭艾虎辟羣邪)" and the Chinese saying "Jade swallow, mugwort tiger light (玉燕銰頭艾虎輕)."

In folk society, men and women washed their hair and bathed in changp'ot'ang (菖蒲湯, sweet flag-infused water). Children skillfully carved sweet flag roots into various shapes, painted the ends with cinnabar, and wore them. This also seems to have come from the meaning of warding off evil spirits (pyŏksa (辟邪)). Also, at noon on that day, people picked yigmŏkch'o (益母草, motherwort) and medicinal mugwort (yakssuk) and soaked them in alcohol for a while before hanging them on the door, which was said to be for warding off evil spirits, but in reality, it was to dry them and use them for postpartum care, stagnation, and other medicinal purposes. In each region, people made ssŭgui ch'wi ttok (戌衣취떡) (similar to common ch'wi namul (취나물), but with a white underside of the leaf) to eat. In some regions, it was considered auspicious to make soy sauce on that day, so people made soy sauce.

◇Dano Games in Various Regions

If Ch'usŏk (秋夕, Korean Thanksgiving) is a holiday of the southern provinces, then Dano is a holiday of the northern provinces. Ch'usŏk and Dano are, of course, holidays common to all of Korea, but here I am referring to which regions celebrate them better. In the southern provinces, Ch'usŏk is celebrated with great enthusiasm everywhere, but Dano is not celebrated as well. It is just bland and quiet. However, north of Seoul, it is truly celebrated well. In some ways, it is celebrated even better than the New Year or Ch'usŏk. In the past, Seoul used to celebrate it much better than it does now. From the royal court to the common people, men and women, young and old, wore new clothes and ate new seasonal foods. Men wrestled at the Waesŏngdae (倭城臺) and Kuksadang (國師堂) sites on Namsan (南山) and near Kyŏngmuda (景武臺) at the foot of Puksan (北山). At the back hills of Sajik-tong (社稷洞) and near Nugak-tong (樓閣洞) (mostly Paekhojŏng (白虎亭)), they played t'aekhyŏn (擇其緣) and shot arrows, and sangdae (山臺) was also performed. Women enjoyed ch'uch'ŏn (鞦韆) games on a grand scale in front of the Namgwanwangmyo (南關王廟) or Tonggwanwangmyo (東關王廟). However, only traces of the old days remain now.

In Kangwŏn Province, the customs are originally diligent and simple, so there are not many customs of celebrating any holiday extravagantly. However, on this Dano holiday, they celebrate without falling behind other provinces. Every household makes ssŭgui ch'wi ttok (戌衣취떡) to eat, men and women, young and old, wear new clothes, play ch'uch'ŏn (鞦韆), and sometimes wrestle. Yŏngdong (嶺東) celebrates comparatively better than Yŏngsŏ (嶺西). In some places on the coast, they go to the sea to perform ancestral rites to ward off misfortune, making rice cakes of five colors and offering them. This seems to have been transmitted from the custom in southern China of performing ancestral rites for Qu Yuan on May 5th.

It seems that Hamgyŏng Province celebrates better in the mountains than on the coast. The events are the same as in other places: wrestling (for men), ch'uch'ŏn (鞦韆), etc. A special food is songgi (松度) ttok (rice cake with pine tree inner bark) in addition to ssŭgui ch'wi ttok (戌衣취떡). <140> Across both the southern and northern provinces, Kilchu (吉州) and Myŏngyong (明用) are said to celebrate with the greatest fanfare. Hwanghae Province is mostly the same as other provinces, but a special feature of the food is that they make a lot of songp'yŏn (松편, half-moon rice cake) to eat. However, in any part of the country, the most grand, extravagant, and generous celebrations are in Kaesŏng (開城) and P'yŏngyang (平壤). As everyone knows, Kaesŏng has always revered loyalty, filial piety, and fidelity. At the same time, the rules of conduct between men and women are stricter than anywhere else, so once a woman gets married, she rarely goes out, as if she were confined to hell. However, on this Dano day, women from both wealthy and poor families all come out to play. They do not go just anywhere, but only inside Kyŏngdŏkkung (敬德宮). That day is the best day of the year for women, a day of liberation. They prepare delicious food, and they spare no expense on luxury and makeup. The hair ornaments and accessories they wear are things that cannot be seen even in Seoul or P'yŏngyang. It is like seeing the customs of a foreign country. Don't be surprised, the value of the accessories and ornaments that a woman wears on that day is said to be four or five hundred won, or even seven or eight hundred won. In Kaesŏng, they evaluate a family's wealth by looking at a woman's makeup on that day. On that day, Kyŏngdŏkkung becomes a flower garden in an instant. It is more splendid and dazzling than the three thousand court ladies who stood in line during the early days of King Taejo's ascension to the throne. Moreover, with swings hanging from the swaying willow trees, women as beautiful as flowers and the moon flutter their green clothes and red skirts as they swing back and forth, kicking their feet and reaching the branches. It is as if swallows are flying in the drizzling rain, or as if fairies are descending from the Silver River and the Moon Palace. Even someone traveling on a hurried journey like an Ŭiju (義州) express messenger from the old days would want to stop and watch. Even an express train on the Pongch'ŏn (奉天) line would be inhumane if it did not stop after seeing it.
This is just a brief description of the celebrations in Kaesŏng. Kaesŏng celebrates Dano well in this way, but it is all women's play, and there is not much for men to do.

However, P'yŏngyang is not like that. Men and women both play well. The scenery is beautiful, and there are many beautiful women, and they always enjoy playing throughout the four seasons. Isn't there even a saying that the people of P'yŏngyang love to play so much that they have no wealth to pass down for three generations? This Dano celebration is not just for one day like in other places, but for three days, from the 5th to the 7th. On the first day, it is called the "East Mountain Play (Tongsannorŭm (東山노름))," and men and women gather together near the Kwanwangmyo (關王廟) to play. On the second and third days, it is called the "Kija Mausoleum Play (Kijarŭngnorŭm (箕子陵노름))," and men and women play near the Kija Mausoleum. Men wrestle with each other, and women swing on swings with each other. Women from the flower and willow world, as well as housewives, all go out to play, leaving behind only the crippled and the dead. <141> They put on neat makeup on their fair faces, neatly press down their white handkerchiefs, and swing on swings and play in groups of three or five. It is as if white lotuses are in full bloom in the clear waters of Kyŏngho (鏡湖), swaying in the cool breeze, or as if the bright moon is shining in the long autumn night sky. There is not much difference in the food from other places, but a special feature of that place is that they eat seagull eggs, which is a story to tell.

◇Dano and the Tragedy of Life

Today, we know Dano only as a good holiday and enjoy playing, but initially, Dano was considered an unlucky day (agil (惡日)), so people played to ward off the disasters of that day. As mentioned above, in the old days, the royal court attached talismans to the palace gates on Dano, and the common people hung mugwort on the doors, also from the superstition of preventing those disasters. Because Dano was considered an unlucky day, there were many tragedies related to that day in ancient China and Korea. Just as in Japan today, there is a superstition that it is unlucky to marry a woman born in the year of Pyŏng-o (丙午), so young women born in the year of Pyŏng-o become pessimistic and sometimes commit suicide. In ancient China and Korea, there was an evil custom of abandoning children born on May 5th because it was considered unlucky to raise them. In the following, I will give some obvious examples.

In ancient China, during the Warring States period, Mŏngsanggun (孟嘗君) (Tiŏn Mun (田文)), a famous heroic nobleman of Ch'i (齊) was born on May 5th. His father ordered him to be abandoned, but his mother pitied him and secretly raised him. Later, when he grew up, he told Mŏngsanggun about the situation. Mŏngsanggun went to see his father and asked why he abandoned children born on May 5th. His father replied that it was because there was a prejudice that a child born on May 5th would cause his father to die when he grew up and reached the height of the doorframe. Mŏngsanggun laughed and said that since a person's life is given by heaven, how could it be related to the doorframe? If it were related to the doorframe, then if the doorframe were raised as a person grew taller, why would it be necessary to abandon one's own child? His father recognized Mŏngsanggun's extraordinary nature and took him back, and he later became a great figure. Later, during the Chin dynasty, Wang Chin-ak (王鎭惡), the grandson of Wang Maeng (王猛), was also born on May 5th. When his family tried to abandon him, Wang Maeng told the story of Mŏngsanggun and raised him, naming him Chin-ak. Also, Wang Bong (王鳳) was born in the same way, but he was adopted thanks to his uncle's virtue. Ho Kwang (胡廣) of the Sung dynasty, whose original surname was Hwang (黃), was placed in a gourd (pakaji (박아지)) and floated down the river because his parents disliked that he was born on May 5th. A person by the river picked him up and raised him. Later, when his name became known to the world, his parents tried to take him back. Kwang thought to himself that abandoning his birth parents would violate righteousness (ŭi (義)), and abandoning his adoptive parents would betray grace (ŭn (恩)). So, he took the character "Ho (胡)" from the gourd (hollu (葫蘆)) and used it as his surname. Later, he rose to the position of Samsa (三司).

In Korea, Kyŏnhwŏn (甄萱), the king of Later Paekche, the son of King Hŏnan (憲安王) of the Silla Dynasty, was abandoned under the pavilion because he was born on May 5th. A wet nurse secretly picked him up to raise him, but accidentally blinded one of his eyes. Later, when Kyŏnhwŏn grew up and became the king of Later Paekche, he resented this and even attacked and destroyed Silla.

This is a brief account of the events caused by superstition. There were several other tragedies. Qu Yuan of Chu (楚) in China, as mentioned above, was falsely accused by treacherous officials and exiled to Ch'angsa (長沙). Lamenting the world, he drowned himself in the Miluo River (汨羅水) on May 5th. The people of his country pitied him and filled bamboo tubes (taet'ong (竹筒)) with rice and threw them into the water every year on May 5th to perform ancestral rites. There is also a mythical and interesting story about this. During the Kŏnmu (建武) period of the Han Dynasty, a person from Ch'angsa (長沙) named Ou Hoi (歐回) went to the Miluo River (汨羅水) to perform ancestral rites for Qu Yuan. Suddenly, a person came in broad daylight and said, "I am Samnyŏ Taebu (三閭大夫) Qu Yuan. I am grateful that you always perform ancestral rites for me, but I cannot eat well because the dragons (kyoryong (蛟龍)) always steal and eat it. In the future, wrap the sacrificial offerings with tung leaves (tongnyŏp (棟葉)), which the dragons fear the most, and tie them with five-colored thread (osaeksil (五色실)) and throw them into the water." From then on, Hoi performed the rites as he was told. It is said that the custom of the people in later generations of making chuaktok (綜) (粽, Korean rice cake wrapped in leaves) on Dano with five-colored thread (in reality, five-colored garnish) and tung leaves is a vestige of that time. It is also said that the game of rowing boats (kyŏngdo (競渡) or kyŏngjo (競漕)) on that day is because the people of that time pitied Qu Yuan's death and gathered many people, each with a boat, and raced to retrieve his body. This led to the game of kyŏngdo (競渡).
Dano is famous not only for the loyal minister Qu Yuan drowning himself in the water, but also in China for the death of the filial daughter Cho A (曹娥). Cho A was a woman from Hoegnŭpsang'o (會穞上虞) during the late Eastern Han Dynasty. Her father, Cho Kan (曺旰), was a master of music and a skilled shaman (巫祝). On May 5th, he went to the river in his county to perform a shamanic ritual for the water god, but he lost his footing and drowned. His body was never found. At that time, Cho A, Cho Kan's daughter, was only a fourteen-year-old girl. She mourned her father's death and cried day and night by the river for seventeen days. Eventually, she drowned herself in the river. Three days later, Cho A's body floated to the surface, miraculously carrying her father's body on her back. The people of that time were moved by Cho A's filial piety and gave her a funeral and even erected a monument.

◇Cherries and Swings

No matter how well you prepare the food on Seolnal (설날, Lunar New Year), if you eat even one bowl of mandutkuk (만둣국, dumpling soup) wrong, that Seol is ruined. No matter how well you play the Seol games, if a man plays yut (擲■) once wrong or a woman swings on a nŭl (板戱, Korean seesaw) once wrong, that Seol play is in vain. Similarly, no matter how well you prepare the food and play the games on Dano, if you don't eat cherries and swing on a swing on Dano, that Dano will be spent without flavor. Cherries and swings are truly the specialties of Dano.

As everyone knows, cherries are the first fruit to ripen among all fruits. The color is like the pretty lips or cheeks of a young maiden, and the shape is like pearls or stars. The taste is good, and the effect after eating is that it quenches thirst and nourishes the lungs. Therefore, someone in ancient times praised cherries as having five virtues: first, they are the first to ripen among all fruits; second, their color is beautiful; third, their seeds propagate well; fourth, they are free of insects; and fifth, they have medicinal effects. There are many folk songs such as "The tangsagi (唐絲긔) of Kwangju Punwŏn (廣州分院) should contain water cherries to be appropriate. Red water cherries are appropriate for the lips of a big baby."

There are cherries everywhere, in the countryside and in Seoul, but Seoul is the famous production area for cherries. Among Seoul, Songdong (宋洞) inside Tongsomun (東小門) is the best, followed by outside Chang'ŭimun (彰義門), and then Yŏnhwabong (蓮花峰) outside Nammun (南門).
Ch'uch'ŏn (鞦韆) is the most interesting game among Korean games. According to Kojingyesulto (古今藝術圖) regarding its origin, "The Kaedŏk (戒狄) of the north practiced swinging on swings on Hansik (寒食) to train their bodies to be light. Later, the women of Tang (唐) learned it." Also, according to Ch'ŏnbo Yusa (天寶遺事), "In the palace, they competed in swinging on swings on Hansik (寒食), calling it pan-sŏn'gŭi (半仙戱)." From this, it can be inferred that the swing is a legacy of the northern tribes that was transmitted to Tang and then flowed from Tang to Korea. In China, they have always enjoyed this game on Hansik, but in Korea, they enjoy this game on Dano. There are many stories about swings, but I will omit them and introduce the swing poem of the Korean female poet Hŏ Nansŏrhŏn (許蘭雪軒) and then put down my pen.

Swing Poem

Neighboring girls compete on the swings.
They tie their belts and coil their hair, learning to be half-immortals.
The wind sends the colorful ropes up to the sky.
The laughter falls like the sound of jade in the green willow smoke.
After kicking the swing, they adjust their embroidered shoes.
They come down and stand silently on the jade steps.
Their silk shirts are slightly wet with light sweat.
They forget to tell someone to pick up the fallen jade hairpin.

天中佳節 端午이약이
						靑吾

◇端午란엇더한 名節인가

二八處女의 어엽분입살가티 빨굿빨굿한 櫻桃가 가가집(商店)모판과 키쓰를하고 아희들의 작란감(玩具)라 팔가튼 石榴곳이 느진 蜂蝶의무리를 불너드리너라고 벙끗벙끗 우슴을시작하니 今年의 端午도 한멀지안은모양이다. 端午는 우리朝鮮의 三大名節中 한名節이다. 녯날부터 서울이나 시골을물론하고 사람마다 다새옷을해입고 맛잇는음식을 하야먹으며 그네(鞦韆)도뛰고 씨름(男子에 限함)도하고 질겁개노는 조흔명절이다.
이端午의 名節이 츠음으로생기기는 支那의 南方에서부터엿다는데 自來에 傳하는말을들으면 녯적支那의 六國時代에 楚나라의 忠臣으로  文章으로 有名한 屈原이가 奸臣의참소를입고 長沙라는영으로 귀양을갓섯다가 離騷經과 漁父辭等의 名文을짓고 스사로 세상을 悲觀하야 五月五日에 汨(명)羅水라는물에 빠저죽엇더니 그나라사람들이 그를사모하고 한불상히녁이여서 每年五月五日이면 汨羅水에가서 그의제사를지냇섯는데 그것이 因하야 한風俗이되고 名節이되엿다한다. 그風俗이 과연그리하야 생겻는지 는달리생기엿는지 그것은 자서히알수업스나 支那에서 始作된것은 事實이다. 그리고 朝鮮에는 어느부터 그날을 名節로삼엇는지 風俗의 考古學이 素昧한나로서는 한 자서히알수가업스나 新羅末에 後百濟王甄萱이 五月端午에낫섯는데 그것을 不吉하다하고 버리엿다는 歷史를보면 三國時代에도 벌서 端午의風俗이 朝鮮에흘너드러왓던것은 짐작할수잇다.＜138＞
그러면 端午라는것은 그 意味가 어더한것인가? 支那의 녯記錄(風土記)等에 依하면 端은 始字와 뜻이갓고 午는 五字와 共通되는데 녯적夏나라에서 寅月로 歲首를삼엇기 문에 五月을 午月이라고도하고 따러서 五日을 午日이라고한다고하엿다. 그러고보면 端午라는말은 곳 初五日이라는말과 맛찬가지다. 그런데 우리朝鮮에서는 다만 五月五日을 端午라고만 하는줄로알지만은 支那에서는 다른달에도 初五日을 端午라고하는 例가잇섯스니 唐玄宗이 八月五日에 出生하엿는대 그사람의 記錄에 月惟仲秋에 日在端午라한것이 그것이다.(張說大衍曆序) 그리고 端午를  重午라고도하고 水瀨日(俗稱成衣日)이라고도하며 或은 天中之佳節이라고하니 重午라는말은 곳午午― 다시말하면 五五의 略稱이니 九月九日을 重陽이라함과 비슷한말이요 水瀨日은 南支那에서 五月五日 屈原의 祭祀를 여울(瀨)에서 지내는닭에 別名한것이라한다. 그리고 天中佳節은 支那의 녯記錄(例如提要錄)等에 依하면 五月五日 午時를 天中節이라하엿스니 卽五月五日午時가 天의 運行의 正中이되는닭이엿다.

◇端午와 朝鮮의 歌謠․風俗

松柏樹야 버든가지 놉다랏케 그네를매고 綠衣紅裳美人들은 오락가락 추천(鞦韆)을하는데 우리의부엇임(思親歌에는 우리의부모님이라함)네는 어듸를가고 端午時節을 왜 모른단말이냐……라는노래는 단오에 關한노래中에 第一대표덕되는 노래라하겟다. 그노래의 句節은 南道의 短歌에도잇고 西道의 愁心歌에도잇고 녯날서울에서 流行하던 思親歌에도잇다 其外에도 端午에 關한 詩歌라든지 童謠도 한 만타.
그러나 그것은 그럿케장황하게 말치안는다. 그리고 단오에관한풍속으로말하면 단오가 朝鮮三大名節의한아이나만큼 경향을물론하고 이상야릇한풍속이 다만타 먼저 녯날에 宮中에서 행하던일로말하면 그날에 宗廟에 앵도차례를지내고 朝臣들이 하례를드리는것은 例年의일이닛가 말도말고 工曹와 各道各邑의 守令方伯들은 붓채(節扇)와 제철의 産物(卽時食이니 例컨대앵도준치등과가튼것이다)을 진상하고 內醫院에서는 타락탕(성호탕)을드리며 觀象監에서는 누른종희에『五月五日, 天中之佳節, 上得天福, 下得地福, 蚩尤之神, 銅頭鐵身, 赤口赤舌, 四百四病, 一時消滅, 急急如律令』이라는 四十二字를 붉은글시로쓴 부적(符籍)을 드려서 그것을 各宮門 門楣에부치엿스니 그럿은 맛치 支那에서 端午날에 惡病을 예방한다 稱하고 桃印符나 綵繒篆符를만기러 門戶나 屛風새에두는 風俗과가티 惡病을 예방한다는 迷信에서 나온것이다. 그리고 宮內에서는  一般近臣과 族戚에게 節扇, 時物等을 下賜하고 ＜139＞쑥(艾)으로맨든 호랑이를 閣臣에게 논하주어 그집의 女子의머리에 꼿게하엿스니 그것은역시 벽사(辟邪)한다는의미에서 나온것이다. 支那에도 한 그러한풍속이잇섯스니 녯날詩에 銰頭艾虎辟羣邪라던지 支那사람의 玉燕銰頭艾虎輕이라는 句語를보와도 足히알수잇다.
 민간에서는 男女가 그날에 菖蒲湯에 머리도감고 沐浴도하며 아희들은 菖蒲뿌리를 形形色色으로 맵시잇게거서 끗헤다 朱砂칠을하야꼿는다. 이것도 아마 벽사(辟邪)하는 意味에서 나온듯하다. 그날 正午에 益母草와 藥쑥을뜨더서 술에다잠간담그엇다가 다시 門에다매다니 그것은 벽사하기 爲함이라하나 실상은 말니워서 産母, 滯症, 其他藥用에쓰랴고 하는것이다. 各地方에서는 戌衣취(普通의취나물과가튼데 다만 葉底가 흴이다)을하야먹고 엇더한 地方에서는 그날에 醬을담으면 吉하다고하야 장을담으기도한다.

◇各地의 端午노리

秋夕을 南鮮의 名節이라 할것가트면 端午는 北鮮의 名節이다 秋夕이나 端午가 물론 朝鮮全國에다 共通되는 名節이지만은 여긔에말하는것은 그노리의 잘하고 못하는것을가르처 말하는것이다. 南鮮은 秋夕날에는 어느곳을물론하고 흠벅멋이잇게 잘놀지만은 端午날에는 그다지 잘놀지를안는다. 그저 슴슴하고 적적할이다. 그러나 京城以北은 참으로 잘들논다.어느點으로는 正月보다도 秋夕보다도 더잘논다. 京城에도 어전에는 지금보다 썩 잘들놀앗다. 宮中으로부터 民間에지 上下男女老少할것업시 새옷을입고 새철의음식을하야먹음은 물론이고 男子들은 南山의 倭城臺 國師堂터와 北山압의 景武臺附近가튼데서 씨름을하고 社稷洞뒤산과 樓閣洞附近(대개 白虎亭)에서는 택현(擇其緣)도하고 便射도쏘며 산되(山臺)도놀니고 女子들은 南關王廟압 는 東關王廟압헤서 鞦韆노리를 盛大하게하얏다. 그러나 只今에는 다만 녯날의흔적만 남어잇슬이다.
江原道에는 元來에 風俗이 勤儉質朴한닭에 어느 名節이던지 그다지 질탕하게노는풍속은 적지만은 이 端午名節에는 비교덕 남의道에 빠지지안케논다. 집집마다 戌衣취을하야먹고 男女老少가 다 새옷을입으며 鞦韆노리도하고 間或씨름도한다. 嶺西보다는 嶺東이비교덕 더잘논다. 海邊에 엇던곳에서는 五色의주액을하야가지고 除厄을한다고 바다에가서 祭祀도지내는일이잇다. 이것은 南支那에서 五月五日에 屈原이를 祭祀지내는 風俗이 흘너 傳한것갓다.
咸鏡道는 海邊보다 山間이비교덕 잘노는모양인데 노는 科目은 역시 다른곳과가티 角戱(男子) 鞦韆等이오 음식의 特色은 戌衣취 以外에 송긔(松度)을하야＜140＞먹는것이 特色이다. 그런데 南北兩道를 통트러말하면 吉州, 明用이 第一盛況으로논다고하겟다. 黃海道도 대개는 다른道와 맛찬가지나 음식中에 송편을만히하야먹는것이 特色이다. 그러나 어느속어느곳하야도 朝鮮全國中에 가장굉장하고 야단스럽고 푸지막하게잘놀기는 開城과 平壤일것이다. 開城은 누구나 다 아는바와가티 自來로 忠, 孝, 烈을숭상하는 同時에 특별히 男女의 내외하는법이 어느곳보다도 엄절하야 女子가 한번시집을오면 地獄에가친것모양으로 별로 외출을하는일이업다. 그러나 이端午날 하루는 행세하는집안이고 못하는집안이고 女子란女子는 다 놀너나온다. 나오되 아모곳으로나 가는것이안이요 꼭 경덕궁(敬德宮) 안으로만간다. 그날이야말로 女子에게 對하야는 一年中 第一조흔날이요 解放의날이다. 가진맛잇는음식먹이를 잘차리는것은 물론이고 호사라는호사는 힘것다하고 화장이란화장은 가지가지 빼놋치안는다. 머리에꼬진 佩物이라던지 몸에찬노리개는 서울이나 平壤에서는 보지도못하는것을 다가진다. 흡연이 異國의풍속을 구경하는것과갓다. 놀라지마시오 女子한사람의 그날에 가지는패물, 노리개의갑이 四五百圓으로 乃至七八百圓이라고한다. 開城에서는 그날하루의 女子화장한것을보고 그집의 富力을 評價한다고한다. 그날의敬德宮은 불시에꼿밧이된다. 녯날 太祖大王登極初에 三千宮女의 벌녀신것보다 더찬란하고 황홀하다. 더구나 수양버들이 척느러진곳마다 五色이찬란한 그네를매고 꼿도갓고 달도가티 어엽女子들이 雙雙이 그네에 올나 綠衣紅裳을 펄펄날이며 한발구르고 한발굴너 나뭇가지를 락락차는것을보면 그야말로 細雨斜風에 제비가날어드는듯 銀河, 月宮에 仙女가 하강하는듯하야 제아모리 녯날의 義州파발마가티 急한길을가는사람이라도 한번을구경할만하다. 奉天行의 急行車라도 그것을보고 停車를안이한다면 人情이안일것이다.
이것은 開城의노리를 잠깐말한것이다 開城은 이와가티 端午노리를 잘하지만은 전부가 女子의노름이오 男子의노름은 이럿타할것이 별로업다.
그러나 平壤은 그럿치안타. 男子도잘놀고 女子도잘논다. 江山이 華麗하니만콤 美人도만코 四時를 通하야 놀기도잘늘논다. 平壤사람은 놀기를조와하는닭에 三代를나려가는 財産이 업다는말지 잇지안이하냐. 이端午놀이도 다른곳과가티 하루만노는것이안이라 五日서부터 六日, 七日지 三日間이나논다. 첫날에는 소위 東山노름이라하야 關王廟附近에서 男女가함께모혀놀고 第二, 第三日에는 箕子陵노름이라하야 男女가 箕子陵附近에서논다. 男子들은 男子끼리 씨름을하고 女子들은 女子끼리 그네를뛴다. 花柳界의 女子는 勿論이고 家庭부인지도 안진뱅이와 송장만내놋코는 다놀너간＜141＞다. 그―뱃꼿가티 허여멀건얼골에다 素眼丹粧을 말숙하게하고 힌 手巾을 멋잇게눌러쓰고 三三五五로짝을지여 그네도뛰고 노리도하며 노는것을보면 맛치 鏡湖秋水에 白蓮花가 滿開하야 서늘한바람에 너울너울하는것도갓고 秋夜長空에 晧月이비취인것도갓다. 음식으로는 역시다른곳과 별로차이가업스나 그곳 特色으로 갈멕이의알을 먹는것이 한이약이거터일것이다.

◇端午와 人生의 悲劇

지금에 우리들은 端午를 조흔 名節로만알고 잘들놀지만은 최초에는 端午를 惡日이라하야 그날의재앙(災殃)을 막너라고 놀게된것이다. 우에말한것과가티 녯날에 宮中에서 端午날이면 宮門에다 부적을써서부친다든지 民間에서 쑥을문우에 매다는것도 한 그재앙을 예방한다는 미신에서나온것이다. 端午는 이와가티 惡日이라한닭에 녯날에 中國이나 朝鮮에는 그날에 關한 悲劇이퍽만헛섯다. 지금에 日本에서 丙午生의 女子와 婚姻을하면 不吉하다고하야 婚姻을잘하지안는 迷信이잇는닭에 丙午生의 靑春女子들이 세상을 悲觀하고 각금 自殺하는일이 잇는것과가티 녯날中國과 朝鮮에서는 五月五日에 子女를나흐면 不吉하다하야 그것을 기르지도안코 버리는惡風이잇섯다. 이다음에는 그몃가지의 헌저한 例를들어 말하랴한다.
녯적 支那의 六國時代에 齊나라의 豪俠貴公子로 有名한 孟嘗君(田文)은 五月五日에 낫섯는데 그아버지가 그를버리라하얏더니 그어머니가 불상히녁이고 비밀히길넛다가 長成한뒤에 孟嘗君에게 그러한 事情을말하니 孟嘗君이 그아버지를 차저보고뭇되 五月五日에 나흔자식을 버리는것이 무슨닭이냐고한즉 그아버지가 대답하기를 五月五日에나흔자식이 잘아서 키가문지방에닷게되면 그아비가 죽는다는 嫌忌가잇기 문에 그러한다고하니 孟嘗君이 우서갈오되 사람이 목숨을 한울에서 바덧거던 엇지문지방에 관계가잇스리오 만일에 문지방에 관계가잇다면 사람의키가 잘아는대로 문지방을 놉히엿스면 그만이지 엇지 구태여 天倫의 子息을 버리기지하리오 하니 그아버지가 孟嘗君의 非凡한것을알고 다시 收養하야 뒤에큰 人物이되엿섯다. 그뒤 晋나라 時代에 王猛의 孫子 王鎭惡이가 한 五月五日에낫섯는데 家人들이 다버리랴고하닛가 王猛이가 孟嘗君의 이약이를하고 거더길느되 鎭惡이라 이름하고  王鳳이도 그와가티낫스나 그 叔父의 德으로 收養되엿스며 宋의 胡廣은 本姓이 黃氏엿는데 五月五日에 나흔닭에 父母가 嫌忌야하 葫蘆(박아지)에다느이 河流에띄웟더니 河邊에잇는사람이 건저서기른바 뒤에이름이 세상에나게되매 그부모가 다시차지랴고하니 廣이스사로 생각하되 生한 父母를버리면 義애를이고 養＜142＞父母를버리면 恩을배반하는것이라하고 이에 葫蘆의 胡字를 取하야 姓을胡로쓰고 그뒤에 벼살이 三司에지이르럿다.
우리朝鮮에는 新羅末에 憲安王의아들 後百濟王甄萱이 五月五日에난닭에 父母가기르지안코 樓下에버리엿더니 乳母가기르랴고 몰래밧다가 잘못바더 한눈을멀게하엿는데 그뒤에 萱이 長成하야 後百濟王이되매 그것을 怨恨하야 新羅를 攻滅한일지잇섯다.
이것은 迷信으로 因하야 생겨난일을 잠깐말한것이다 그 외에도 몃가지의 悲劇이잇섯스니 卽支那楚나라의 屈原은 우에잠깐 말한것과가티 奸臣의참소로 長沙땅에 구양을갓다가 세상을 悲歎하야 五月五日에 汨(명)羅水에빠저죽엇는데 그나라사람들이 그를불상이녁여서 每年五月五日이면 대통(竹筒)에 밥을느어 물속에던지고 祭祀를지냇섯는데 여긔에 對하야 神話가튼 자미스러운이야이가 한잇스니 漢나라 建武年間에 長沙사람 歐回가 汨羅水에가서 屈原의祭祀를지내엿더니 白晝에 忽然이한사람이와서 말하기를 나는 三閭大夫 屈原인데 그대가 매양 나의祭를 지내주는것은 感謝하나 항상 蛟龍의무리가 흠처먹는닭에 잘어더먹지를못하니 이뒤에는 蛟龍의가장무서워하는 棟葉으로 祭物을싸고  五色실로묵거서 물속에느흐라하니 回가그뒤부터는 그말과가티하야 祭를지내고 後世에 民間에서 端午日에 주악(綜)을맨드는데 五色絲(實은 五色고명)와 棟葉을늦는것은 그의 遺風이라한다. 그날에 競渡(競漕)의노리를하는것도 그의사람들이 屈原의죽은것을 불상히녁여서 그 尸體를건지랴고 여러사람이모혀 각각배를가지고 先後를닷투어갓섯는데 그것이 因하야 競渡의 戱가되엿다고한다.
端午는 屈原이가튼 忠臣이 물에빠저죽은 것으로 有名할안이라 曺娥가튼 孝女가 죽은것으로도 支那에서는 有名하니 東漢末에 曺娥라는 女子는 會穞上虞땅의사람이엿는데 그의 父親旰는 音樂의 名家로 한굿(巫祝)을잘하는 男子엿다. 五月五日에 그 郡의 江에가서 水神祭의 굿을하다가 失足하야 물에빠저죽엇는데 尸體조차더듸로갓는지 찾지를못하엿다. 그 曺旰의딸인 曺娥는 겨우 十四의 少女로 그아버지의 죽은것을 哀痛하며 밤낫 十七日동안을 江邊에서 哭號하더니 그만 江에빠저죽엇섯다. 그런지 第三日만에 曺娥의尸體가 물에올낫는데 신통하게도 그아버지의 尸體를 등에업고잇스니 그사람들이 다 曺娥의孝를 感泣하야 葬禮를지내주옥 碑지세웟섯다.

◇櫻桃와 鞦韆

스을날에 아모리 음식을 잘차려먹엇다할지라도 만둣국한그릇을 잘못먹엇다 할것가트면 그스을은 잘못＜143＞쇠인것이요 아모리 스을노리를 잘하얏다할지라도 男子로서 윳(擲■)한번을 잘못놀고 女子로서 느을(板戱)한번을 잘못뛰엿다하면 그스을의 노리는 헛되인 노리라할것이다. 그와맛찬가지로 아모리 단오며일에음식을잘차려먹고 노리를 잘하얏다할지라도 단오에 앵도를못먹고 그네를뛰지못하얏다 할것가트면 그단오는 無味하게 지냇다할것이다. 櫻桃와 鞦韆은 참으로 단오의 名物이다.
누구나 다 아는바와가티 櫻桃는 여러實果中에 第一먼저익는 實果이다. 빗의곰기는 어엽 處女의 입살이나 빰도갓고 형체의어엽뿌기는 珍珠도갓고 明星도갓다 맛의 조흔것도 조흔것이어니와 먹은뒤의 效果로말하면 止渴도하고 肺를윤택케한다 그럼으로 넷적의엇던사람은 櫻桃가 다섯가지의 德이잇다고 층찬하얏스니 一은 百果中 먼저익는것이오 二는 色態가고흔것이오 三은 種子가 번식을잘함이요 四는 버러지가업는것이오 五는 藥效가잇는것이라하얏다. 俗歌에도『廣州分院 당사긔는 물앵도를담어야 제적이니. 울긋불긋 물앵도는 큰아긔입살이 제적이니』하는노래도 한만타.
시골이고 서울이고 앵도의 업는곳이 별로업지만은 앵도의 名産地는 서울이라하겟다. 서울中에도 東小門안 宋洞이 第一이오 그다음은 彰義門박 그다음은 南門박 蓮花峰일것이다.
鞦韆은 朝鮮遊戱中 가장 자미잇는遊戱다. 그 由來에 對하야는 古今藝術圖에 依하면『北方의 戒狄이 寒食節에 鞦韆戱를하야 몸의 輕捿하기를 연습하얏더니 뒤에 唐의 女子가 배웟다』하고  天寶遺事에는『宮中에서 寒食節에 鞦韆의 戱를 競하니 半仙戱라고 呼하얏다』고하얏다. 이로미루워보면 鞦韆은 北狄의 遺風으로 唐에 遺傳되고  唐에서 朝鮮에 流入된것이다. 그리고 中國에서는 自來로 寒食에 그遺戱를하나 朝鮮에서는 端午에으르러 그遺戱를한다 鞦韆에 關한이 약이는 퍽도만치만은 亦是略하고 最後로 朝鮮女流詩人 許蘭雪軒의 鞦韆詞를 紹介하고 擱筆한다.
