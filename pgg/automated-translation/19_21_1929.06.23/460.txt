The Lament of Yun ○-deok, a Grievance of Youth
						Gwanaksan In

I am here! The wronged and sorrowful spirit, Yun ○-deok, is here!.

On the eighth day of the eighth month of the Byeong-in year (丙寅), I, who threw myself into the deep waters of the Black Sea (玄海水), am here!.

Unfilial to my family and labeled a "prostitute" (왜장년) by the world, having nowhere to place my heart or body, Yun ○-deok, who ended her life, is here.

◇

It's already been through the lesser and greater funerals since I died. It's not right to receive the funeral offerings. I haven't even gotten married properly, nor have I ever raised a child. A spinster's wretched death; no one pours a glass of bitter wine and mourns me.

In life, there were close male and female friends, but I died so scandalously that no one holds a memorial service for me. My "Hymn of Death (死의 讚美)," written with blood to lament my unfortunate fate, was useless, only leaving behind the Victor record label. No one seems to listen to that song and truly understand how tormented and heartbroken I was!.

◇

The world says I had an affair with Kim! But if you look back on the history between him and me, everyone knew that I never made him the object of my life and body.

So, ever since I met his spirit in the water, I've been dying from resentment from that man.

He was a friend from Tokyo six or seven years ago… From the time the so-called Dong-u Association (同友會) troupe, which cherishes the closest relationship, was organized and Tokyo students did fundraising performances for poor students in Joseon, he as a stage director and I as a mere singing woman were together in the wandering troupe.

◇

After that, I returned to Joseon, carelessly used my body, and my name was spread badly everywhere. When I was immersed in all sorts of Kim Seung-ga-like (김승가든) aspects of life, if I had believed in and cherished Mr. Kim as much as my life, I would definitely have a diamond-like <114> chaste chastity concept. If that were the case, I don't know how happy I would have been. When letters full of passion came from him, I didn't dislike them, but

I thought it would be ridiculous to reply sweetly, "Is there no other man but you?" and left it as it was, wandering around on my own, only hastening the grave of the wandering soul (자귀).

◇

Thinking about it, it's infuriating ten or twenty times! But like flowers that don't bloom for ten days, and flowers that wither when they fall, how could Yun ○-deok always be young and receive only love? After being deceived by Ri ○-○ and even experiencing the Siberian wind, I gave up on myself.

Love, men, and money – what are they? I decided to live it up and play around.

I set up camp on the second floor of the Sueun-dong ○○ photo studio and even developed the ruthlessness to wage war with all the men. I even met an old man, Mr. Jeung, who had some money. I met so-called modern boys (모-던뽀이) who had a passion for music, rode in cars with them, and had dinner at the Chosun Hotel with a young master from a wealthy family who had only heard of the singer Yun ○-deok. But as the days and months went by, the root of the pessimism that "the world is empty" deepened.

◇

It was like blindly looking at flower beds in a field without any sense of direction, then falling into a ditch. When I came to my senses, it was already too late. The traces of the innocent Yun ○-deok were covered in mud. So, when I heard that my younger sister ×-deok was going to America to study with money from Ewha Hakdang (梨花學堂), I didn't want to show anyone any particular expression. I was happy with my sister, but I returned to the inn and cried all night.

◇

If I had only walked the path of truth, I would have gone to the world before my sister and been respected by the Joseon music scene... This hopeless regret surged up, and I cried and cried until dawn. There was no use. I was so dumbfounded that the final determination, "Damn it, let's die and get rid of this fate!" flashed through my mind.

So, thinking that if I were going to die anyway, I would leave behind a song instead of a will, I hurriedly asked the Il-dong Phonograph (日東蓄音器) company to record "Hymn of Death" and about twenty other songs.

◇

At that time, there were two thoughts. If I could meet Mr. Kim and go safely to Naples, Italy, I would study singing for a few years and make a name for myself again. If I couldn't, then dying would wash away the flesh and misfortune and overcome them. But since Mr. Kim also had no freedom with money and body and couldn't go, I thought that dying was the way to wash away the flesh and misfortune and rise above them, and I threw myself into the Korean Strait (玄海灘), leaving behind the traces of a death entrusted to the Deoksu Maru (德壽丸).

◇ <115>

Young and beautiful sisters with soft hearts in the world! Yun ○-deok's afterlife, I see and know. My belief that love affairs are sacred is now futile. When you die, it's sacred, but after you die, everything is in vain! The sound of "Oops!" only comes after you go down to the Dragon Palace Gate. Isn't the way to live again vague? I couldn't stand my personality and died, but what sin did Mr. Kim commit? If I had loved him enough to hold him in my arms, I wouldn't be sorry, but it's like floating in the water like a phantom. Mr. Kim's promising future is truly immeasurable and heartbreaking. Of course, he had his own reasons to die…….

◇

A young woman's body is like ripe food. Hungry loves are everywhere, reaching out and licking their lips. But it is my nature not to be humble to others.

"Hmph, what if you lick your lips, you bastards?"

I slapped men on the cheek and cursed like a man. In my own way, I tried to act more than a man, but on the contrary, decent and dignified men were frightened by my yelling and ran away, and only wicked beasts – those who had all their cunning and courage developed only to seduce and drive women crazy – were caught.

◇

In the beginning, I tried to be alert, resist, and laugh mockingly, but what could I do? No matter how loud I shouted and made a fuss, I was still a woman. I was a woman who was inherently difficult to be strong. I was deceived once, twice, and in the end, I was in a desperate situation. How could I not be upset?

◇

Women should just be women. The attitude of separation between men and women must be firmly maintained. How precious is chastity? How miserable is the entire life of a woman who has not been able to preserve her chastity? It's hard to know until you experience it, and because it's not that painful, I'm worried about the promising future of my dear younger sisters. Sisters, colleagues, we are women. If we are women, let's keep our vocation as women. If we take even one wrong step, a second Yun ○-deok will be born. Men are trustworthy people, but when the fire burns in their eyes, they are more frightening than lions or vipers. How many innocent virgins' lives have been ruined by their shameless burning flames?

◇

I don't necessarily curse men. I know that I have completely repaid the grudge of being ruined by men by dying with Mr. Kim. But wasn't that repayment of the grudge too sad and cruel? When I threw myself into the Korean Strait (玄海) with him in my arms -- only at that very moment was there love enough to grab and swallow the Earth. But that is as fleeting as being drunk on five-colored wine (五色酒). It is too precious to see a strong existence on this solemn Earth. But I sang (Hymn of Death) before I left the path of death. <116>

◇

Repaying a grudge means not creating a grudge. Why did I create such a grudge against all men? Should I blame it only on the sins of men? That would be wrong. Even though I'm dead, I can't say such brazen things. Everyone thought I was quite strong-willed, but in reality, I was a very passionate woman with a hazy will. Because of that, my life was a mess, and the lament I'm making now is also a mess with no direction.

◇

Love is a temporal art. It is the same meaning as being intoxicated when we listen to the music of "Elman" or "Chrysler." Therefore, when the concert is over, the lingering sounds of songs and music remain in the heart. Love must also fade, and when it fades, only ashes remain in the heart. In this world where men's debauchery is tolerated and women's mistakes are brought to light, we, new women—we who have many opportunities to come into contact with men—must think very carefully. Love is a temporal art. Therefore, love is not rice, but a snack. It is less trustworthy to have a lover who only buys snacks. We should eat snacks, but we also need to eat rice. However, young women who are governed by emotion often look for spatial ideals in temporal art and seek a lifetime of food in snacks.

◇

How miserable is the lament of Yun ○-deok, who did everything until the day she died, after her death? This is my view of life that I only realized after I died. But what's the use of it now that I'm dead? I only hope that my sisters and colleagues in the world will not deviate from their personality and reason and fall into the path of ugly love. The fate of a virgin's life is determined at the moment she first gives her heart to a man. Since this is something that is done without anyone knowing and without consulting anyone, the lament of the dead Yun ○-deok seems to be more valuable than the lament of a shaman who borrows the house of a shaman who is hungry for a cow's head or a rice cake offering.

◇

It is foolish to die only for love. Because there will be plenty of time to live for love. Therefore, Kim, who has less room to die than I do, often blames me for becoming a water ghost. But what can I do? Since we died together, we have no choice but to float in the water together... Still, Kim ate enough funeral offerings to fill his stomach, so he is better off than me.

Oh, how sad, my fate! Even the world of the living is empty. My younger sister, who believed that I had gone to Italy, heard the news of my death in America and was so devastated that she said, "When I said goodbye to my sister, she said she was going to Italy, so maybe the family doesn't know she went to Italy and thinks she's dead." She wrote a letter saying, "Maybe she's in Italy," and made a fuss as if she knew.

Oh my god, my spirit! Since I can't live again, what's the point of pretending to know such things? The spirit in the water is lonely.

Oh, how sad, my fate! If I had grabbed any man and lived, going to concerts, this would not have happened... Oh my god, this is my fate! There is no place to attach my body to in the deep waters of the Korean Strait (玄海灘)……. <117>
