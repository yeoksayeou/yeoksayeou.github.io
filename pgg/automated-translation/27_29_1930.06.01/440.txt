壬辰史話 玉浦大捷과 閑山大捷 (Imjin History: The Great Victory of Okpo and the Great Victory of Hansan)
申瑩澈 (Shin Hyeong-cheol)
잡저 (Miscellaneous Essay)

Three hundred and thirty-nine years ago, on April 17th, a messenger ran like a bee-stung person from the south, heading towards Hanyang (漢陽). He brought the dire news that a large Japanese army had unexpectedly invaded, killed Song Sang-hyeon (宋象賢), the magistrate of Dongnae (東萊府使), and was heading north towards Hanyang through Yangsan (梁山), Ulsan (蔚山), Eonyang (彦陽), and Gyeongju (慶州) with a triumphant air, making the situation extremely critical.

At that time, Toyotomi Hideyoshi (豐臣秀吉), the valiant shogun of Japan, planned to invade Joseon. He repeatedly negotiated with Joseon, asking to borrow passage to attack the Ming dynasty (明), but Joseon, mindful of its long-standing relationship with the Ming dynasty, flatly refused. Hideyoshi, angered by this, invaded Joseon, commanding his subordinate generals to lead their respective land and sea forces across the sea from Busan. The land army numbered 250,000, and the navy consisted of over 9,000 warships. On April 13th, they captured Busan, and on the 15th, they also captured Dongnae, where Song Sang-hyeon died rather than compromise his integrity. By the time this news reached Hanyang, only five days had passed since the Japanese troops had entered Joseon territory.

Until then, the people had been singing songs of peace, and the court officials were preoccupied with their own interests. The court, upon hearing the unexpected news, was thrown into chaos. They appointed Generals Yi Il (李謚), Seong Eung-gil (成應吉), and Jo Gyeong (趙儆) to defend against the enemy on three different routes. However, General Yi was defeated in Sangju (尙州), and even General Shin Rip (申砬), who was trusted by the court like a mountain and a tide, was defeated and killed with his 8,000 soldiers at Tangeumdae (彈琴坮) in Chungju (忠州) in just a few days. The general disappointment was beyond words, and the enemy's momentum grew, advancing towards Hanyang like a rapidly rising tide.

As things came to this pass, the court was in utter confusion. King Seonjo (宣祖) was left with no choice but to abandon the capital and devise a plan to flee west. He departed and stayed in Gaeseong (開城). On May 3rd, Hanyang also fell to the Japanese army. The perilous state of affairs became more pressing with each passing moment. The king continued his journey and moved to Pyeongyang (平壤) on the 8th. He gave Generals Kim Myeong-won (金命元) and Shin Gil (申硈) 12,000 troops to firmly defend the Imjin River (臨津江) in Gyeonggi Province (京畿道), preventing them from crossing west again. However, that too was in vain, and when they were defeated on the 17th, the Japanese army occupied Gaeseong again in ten days. As they approached the Daedong River (大同江) on June 8th, King Seonjo finally moved and stayed in Uiju (義州) on the border. On the 15th, even Pyeongyang was captured.

In just two months since the Japanese army had entered Joseon, the enemy filled the eight provinces, and the people wandered in turmoil, weeping and wailing. The horrific sight was unbearable to witness. It was summer, and the green shade was rich on every tree, but even the joyful sound of birds could not be heard. The eight provinces were buried in wind and rain, and even the sun and moon lost their light.

Now, before this time, there was a great general in Joseon, whose family name was Yi (李), his given name was Sun-sin (舜臣), and his posthumous title was Chungmu (忠武). He is commonly referred to as Chungmugong (忠武公) by later generations. His detailed background is such that he is a loyal subject of all time and an unprecedented great general whose fame is high in Eastern and Western history, not just in Joseon, so there is no need to explain it again here. He was not only extraordinarily insightful and possessed extraordinary wisdom but also a man of both literary and military accomplishments. He passed the military examination (武科) early on and quelled foreign and domestic enemies while serving in various positions, repeatedly demonstrating military prowess. As a result, in the year he turned forty-seven, in February of the year before the Imjin War broke out, the court appointed him Naval Commander of Jeolla Left Province (全羅左道水軍節度使). He received the appointment with gratitude and immediately took office, and the opportunity to demonstrate his unique strategies and extraordinary loyalty finally came to Chungmugong Yi Sun-sin.

The Duke originally had a sense that the Japanese would surely invade, so upon arriving in Jeolla Left Naval Base (全羅左水營), he ordered the main camp and all its subordinate garrisons (各鎭) to prepare for war. He repaired weapons and warships, created iron caltrops (쇠사슬) and laid them out at the sea entrance to block the enemy ships from entering, and created the turtle ship (거북선), which is said to be the ancestor of the world's first ironclad ship. The ship's hull was made by joining ten planks, with a length of sixty-four ja eight chi (예순넉자여덜치), a head width of twelve ja, a tail width of ten ja six chi, and a waist width of fourteen ja five chi. The left and right side panels were made by attaching seven planks, with a height of seven ja five chi, the length of the lowest plank being sixty-eight ja, gradually increasing in length as they went upwards, with the length of the top plank being one hundred and sixteen ja. The front was the head of a dragon, and the back was the tail of a turtle. It created fog by burning sulfur and saltpeter in its head, obscuring the enemy's eyes, and hid weapons and warships inside, with places for the soldiers to rest. On the deck, it made paths in the shape of a cross for people to pass through, placing awl blades, and opening gun holes in the front, back, left, and right. When it met an enemy ship, it would throw down reeds and cover it, removing the awl blades to prevent them from climbing up, and if the enemy tried to attack, it would fire guns all at once, so no matter how strong the enemy was, they could not dare approach. It was able to go against the waves and freely navigate when the tide was high or low. Its ingenious invention was truly admired by everyone.

As he waited for the moment to come, the Japanese troops invaded by land and sea in April of the Imjin year, ravaging the eight provinces. In the middle of the night on April 15th, an urgent report from Naval Commander of Gyeongsang Right Province Won Gyun (元均) arrived at Chungmugong's naval base. It contained information from various sources that about one hundred and fifty Japanese ships were heading towards Haeundae (海雲臺) and Busanpo (釜山浦), and that they were continuously appearing. This was not the usual annual Japanese ship, and there must be a reason, so he urged them to be fully prepared and wait for developments. The Duke immediately organized his troops and fleet and waited for developments at the sea entrance. On the one hand, he sent messages to the concurrent Observation Commissioner (兼觀察使), Military Commissioner (兵馬節度使), and Naval Commander of Right Province (右道水軍節度使) by fast horse, and he ordered all coastal ports (沿海各官浦) to be especially vigilant. The next morning, information came again from Gim Su (金晬), the concurrent Observation Commissioner of Gyeongsang Province, that about four hundred Japanese ships were anchored across from Busanpo. With the enemy's strength being so great, he was truly concerned and continued to transmit the information gradually, waiting for developments. The Duke immediately judged that if the enemy's strength was so great, they would not only invade one place but would surely divide their forces and attack stealthily. He further organized his ships and waited for developments at the sea entrance. As before, he resent documents to each naval base and ordered his subordinate ports to closely watch and report on enemy movements, and even swept up any remaining warships, carefully investigating them.

After hearing the information that had come more than twice from Won Gyun's and Kim Su's areas, and preparing for war in that way, he maintained close contact with various military camps and reported to the nation, waiting for the war to break out. On April 16th, another report came from the area of Gyeongsang Right Naval Commander Won Gyun. Alas! Sadly, it was the dire news that Busan had already been captured by the enemy.

Though shocked and furious beyond measure, Chungmugong, handling matters with careful deliberation befitting a great event, continued to organize his ships and station them at the sea entrance, waiting for reports. At the same time, he sent messengers to each naval base and port. He thought deeply, "Jeolla Left Province is separated from Gyeongsang Province by only the sea, and this province is the most important strategic point for the enemy. Once the enemy crosses the border, it will be extremely difficult to restrain them. We must not hesitate and wait." He urgently summoned his generals to the main camp and said,

"Right now, a large Japanese army has suddenly invaded, captured Busan, and is moving inland. The situation is extremely critical. In times like these, waiting idly for developments is too lenient. We must prepare our troops and go out to attack the enemy."

However, his subordinate generals were reluctant to move their camps and cross into other provinces. The Duke resolutely commanded his generals with military law, planning to advance into Gyeongsang Province to attack the enemy. Meanwhile, urgent reports came incessantly from various military camps in Gyeongsang Province that the Japanese army was strong and that all the towns and villages had become fortresses, with no one able to stand against them. The enemy continued their triumphant advance, moving as if through an undefended land. The court urgently sent a message to the throne, requesting that warships be prepared and sent. The court also sent orders to Gyeongsang Right Naval Commander Won Gyun to cooperate and destroy the enemy ships. How could the blood and arms of a great general not stir?

On April 29th, he summoned the naval commanders under his command and gathered them in front of the naval base, planning to set sail on a bright day. However, concurrent Observation Commissioner Yi Gwang (李洸) was concerned about the direness of the situation and had the naval commander of this province follow behind the Duke, so he was waiting for the arrival of Naval Commander Yi Eok-gi (李億棋) of Right Province, who said that he would leave the Right Naval Base on the 30th, to show force and depart all at once. However, as the days drew nearer when the enemy would capture the coastal inland provinces and threaten Gyeonggi Province, and as the nation's crisis became more and more pressing, none of Chungmugong and his generals could remain idle. Without waiting for the arrival of the Right Naval Commander, he urged his subordinate generals to set sail on the fourth day of May, at the crowing of the first rooster. There were twenty-four panokseon (板屋船), fifteen hyeopseon (挾船), and forty-six pojakseon (砲作船). Leading his soldiers and warships, he arrived off the coast of Sobi-po (所非浦) in Gyeongsang Right Province. As the day was growing dark, he set up camp there and spent the night. The next day, at first dawn, he set out again and reached the Tangpo front sea (唐浦前洋), where he had promised to meet the Gyeongsang naval forces. However, Gyeongsang Right Naval Commander Won Gyun was nowhere to be found at the promised place. The Duke immediately sent his light and fast ship to deliver a letter to Won Gyun, informing him to come quickly to Tangpo, and waited. The next day, late in the morning, Won Gyun arrived in a hurry, barely riding a single ship from Hansando (閑山島) in his territory. At that time, Won Gyun had already been defeated by the Japanese army and had lost over seventy warships, and he was asking Chungmugong for help. The two naval commanders grabbed each other's hands and wept together, comforting each other. They renewed their mutual encouragement, asking about the number of enemy ships, the places where they were anchored, and the procedures for engaging in battle, carefully inquiring about each detail. The magistrates and commanders of various ports from within Gyeongsang Province gathered with a very enthusiastic look. Namhae Magistrate Gi Hyo-geun (南海縣令奇孝謹), Mijo Port Commander Kim Seung-ryong (彌助項僉使金勝龍), and Pyeongsan Port Commander Kim Chuk (平山浦權官金軸) came on one panokseon (板屋船). Saryang Manho Yi Yeo-cheom (蛇梁萬戶李汝恬) and Sobi-po Commander Yi Yeong-nam (所非浦權官李英男) each came on a hyeopseon (挾船). Yeongdeungpo Manho U Chi-jeok (永登浦萬戶禹致績), Jise-po Manho Han Baek-rok (知世浦萬戶韓百祿), and Okpo Manho Yi Un-ryong (玉浦萬戶李雲龍) each came on two panokseon (板屋船). For two days, they continued to arrive, gathering all the commanders in one place. After repeatedly emphasizing what needed to be done, they arrived at Songmal-po front sea (松末浦前洋) on Geoje Island (巨濟島). As the sun was already setting, they spent the night there. The next day, at the crack of dawn, they all set sail, heading towards Cheonseong (天城) and Gadeok (加德), where the enemy ships were located.

At noon that day, they arrived at Okpo front sea (玉浦前洋) and discovered that the enemy ships were in Sacheon shipyard (洒川船倉). They headed straight there and arrived. The Japanese troops had already disembarked and set up camp on the mountains, mooring their warships in the bay and defending it strongly. It was truly impossible to resist the situation of hitting the enemy by going against the current in the bay, but Chungmugong, without showing any concern, urged his generals and charged forward all at once, shouting loudly. The arrows shot by both armies flew like rain, and the sound of guns shook the heavens and the earth, filling the mountains and rivers with smoke, making it impossible to distinguish anything nearby. Only then did the enemy's morale greatly weaken. Countless were those who died from the arrows, and it was impossible to know how many had their heads cut off by the generals. They burned over forty warships, and the remaining enemies fled to the rocks, scrambling over each other, falling into the water and swimming, not knowing what to do. Truly, it was a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood. However, on this side, Military Officer Na Dae-yong (軍官羅大用) was hit by a bullet, and Chungmugong was also hit by a bullet on his left shoulder, piercing through his back, but fortunately, he did not suffer a serious injury. This happened on May 29th of the Imjin year, and it is known to the world as the Great Victory of Okpo (玉浦大捷) by Yi Chungmugong (李忠武公).

At noon the next day, they set sail and arrived at Saryang (蛇梁) sea in Goseong (固城), resting the troops and giving out rations, spending the night there. The next day, late in the morning, they scouted and found that the enemy ships were moored at Tangpo (唐浦) shipyard. Heading straight to Tangpo front sea, they found over twenty enemy ships and about 3,000 enemy troops. As they surrounded and fought each other, there was a large enemy ship with a tower on it, about three or four gil (길) high, and a Japanese general sat on top of it, not moving. Immediately, the turtle ship charged straight towards it, and as they fired guns and arrows, Middle Guard General Gwon Jun (中衞將權俊) shot the enemy general down. Heungyang Soldier Jin Mu-seong (興陽保人陳武晟) beheaded him. The enemy troops were shocked and scattered all at once, being hit by the guns and arrows of the generals and soldiers, falling over each other, and the sound of those running away could not be counted. Suddenly, about twenty large Japanese warships appeared from the vicinity of Busan, but seeing the Duke's forces, they fled to Gaedo (介島). The generals urged their ships and chased after them to the outer sea, but as the day was already growing dark, they could not engage in battle, so they spent the night on Changsin Island (昌信島) in Jinju (晋州). The next morning, they urged their generals again to besiege Gaedo from both sides, but the enemy had already scattered during the night, leaving none behind, and had fled. They tried to go to Goseong, but the wind was too strong, and they could not do anything. The Duke spent a day in frustration, and as he was about to set sail for Geoje Island the next day, Jeolla Right Naval Commander Yi Eok-gi finally arrived with twenty-five warships. The military strength greatly increased, and the generals and soldiers, who had always been concerned about being alone and weak and had been fighting for a long time and were tired, were overjoyed to see the reinforcements arriving. They combined their forces and made firm promises, staying overnight at Chakpo Bridge (鑿浦梁).

The next morning, for some reason, the fog was so thick that it was impossible to distinguish between the sea and the land, but it cleared up late. As they were about to raise the sails and go to attack the enemy ships on Geoje Island, seven or eight Geoje residents, including Hyanghwa Geummo (向化金毛), came on a small boat and said that the enemy ships that had fled from Tangpo had gone to Goseong Danghangpo (固城唐項浦) via Geoje. Without wasting any time, they rowed to Danghangpo front sea, where there was one large Japanese warship with a high tower, with one enemy general sitting on it, twelve medium ships, and twenty small ships. They defeated them all at once. Countless were those who died from the arrows. They cut off the heads of seven enemy generals, and the remaining enemies fled to the land. The military strength of the left and right navies greatly shook the enemy.

For two days, they scouted the location of the enemy ships and arrived at Yeongdongpo front sea. They heard that the enemy ships were at Yulpo (栗浦). They hid their ships and attacked from the side. The enemy ships knew first and fled to the South Sea. The generals chased after them all at once, and Snake Island Commander Kim Wan (蛇島僉使金浣), U-hu Yi Mong-gwi (虞侯李夢龜), and Nokdo Manho Jeong Un (鹿島萬戶鄭運) each captured one enemy ship and returned. The number of enemy heads cut off was about thirty-six.

The Japanese army invaded Joseon for about three months, and the eight provinces were almost completely ravaged by the enemy, but only the coastal areas of southern Joseon were preserved like a fortress, entirely thanks to the naval battles of Yi Chungmugong, who always met and defeated enemy ships in the Great Victory of Okpo (玉浦大戰) and the Great Victory of Danghangpo (唐項浦大戰), never losing a single battle and always winning.

However, the Japanese navy, which had not gained anything in the naval battles, still continued to take advantage of the gaps to spy and invade from time to time. Chungmugong, to defend against them, did not distinguish between wind and rain, day and night, and could not rest his body, being constantly busy.

About a month after the Great Victory of Danghangpo, Chungmugong returned to his main naval base. As the enemy's strength became strong again, their appearances and disappearances were unpredictable. On July 6th, he again led his navy and arrived at Gonyang (昆陽) and Noryangjin (鷺梁津) in Namhae (南海). The Gyeongsang Naval Commander gathered seven shattered warships and came to stay together. After promising each other again in the sea, they arrived at Changsin Island (昌信島) in Jinju (晋州) and stayed overnight. The next day, the fog was so heavy that they could not sail. They barely arrived at Goseong Dangpo as the day was growing dark. As they were gathering wood and fetching water, a man named Kim Cheon-song (金千孫), who had been fleeing from the mountains, ran in in a fluster and reported that about seventy large, medium, and small enemy ships were anchored in Gyeonnaeryang (見乃梁), in the Goseong Geoje area, from Yeongdeungpo front sea. Again, he urged his generals to head straight for the place where the enemy ships were said to be the next morning, but in the middle, when they were scouting, one large and one medium Japanese ship were at the forefront, looking around before turning back. When they arrived at the hidden place, there were thirty-six large ships, twenty-four medium ships, and thirty small ships, spreading out their formation.

Gyeonnaeryang (見乃梁) was originally a narrow area, and there were many hidden islands, so the panokseon (板屋船) were about to collide with each other, making it impossible to accommodate and fight. If the enemy was cornered, they would head for the shore and go on land, which would mean that many enemies would be missed. He planned to lure them out to the open sea of Hansando (閑山島) and completely destroy them. Hansando was located between Geoje and Goseong, with no way to escape in any direction, so even if they landed, they would surely starve to death. First, he sent five or six panokseon (板屋船) to chase and attack the enemy's vanguard, feigning a retreat, and the enemy ships raised their sails and chased after them. Taking advantage of the fact that the enemy had chased them out to the open sea, the Duke again ordered his generals to form a crane wing formation (hakikjin 鶴翼陣) and advance all at once, firing ji (地), hyeon (玄), and seung (勝) guns (총) to shoot down two or three ships first. The enemy ships lost their morale and fled, while his generals rushed forward with triumphant courage, and arrows and bullets flew in turn. The situation was like a gust of wind and thunder, and the shouts shook the sea and the sky. They burned the ships and killed the enemy, almost annihilating them all at once. Suncheon Magistrate Gwon Jun (順天府使權俊) rushed into the enemy ships and first destroyed one high-rise warship. He fired his guns in the open sea, beheading the enemy general and dozens of his subordinates. Gwangyang Magistrate Eo Yeong-dam (光陽縣監魚泳澤) also rushed forward and destroyed one high-rise warship. He fired his guns in the open sea and shot the enemy general, mooring him on Chungmugong's ship. However, before he could be questioned about his crimes, he was hit by an arrow and could not speak. He immediately beheaded him and cut off the heads of twelve other enemy soldiers. He captured one Joseon man. Snake Island Commander Kim Wan (蛇島僉使金浣) fired on one large warship in the open sea, beheading the enemy general and sixteen others. Heungryang Magistrate Bae Heung-rip (興梁縣監裵興立) fired on one large warship in the open sea, beheading eight others. Countless were those who fell and died. Bangdap Commander Yi Sun-sin (訪畓僉使李純信) fired on one large warship in the open sea, beheading only four others. He only focused on shooting and killing, and did not focus on beheading. (omitted)
