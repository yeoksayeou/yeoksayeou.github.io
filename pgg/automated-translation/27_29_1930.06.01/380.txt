소설 (Novel)

When I returned to Tokyo, the situation around me had completely changed. Every part of our movement had not yet recovered from the impact of the Great Earthquake and was staggering and exhausted. The impact on me was also significant. First, I was expelled from school. I could move to another school, but the biggest blow was that "Kumayama," who had been paying for my tuition until then, stopped sending money, calling me an "ungrateful wretch."

"Sada-kko" and I were literally empty-handed. We went around to the homes of comrades S, K, and C, spending a few days at a time. In the meantime, my few books dwindled, one or two at a time. We also picked the pockets of our fellow students. We sold rice and boiled it in a pot, and we also tried living in a restaurant. However, it was clear that we could not continue that kind of life forever. If it were just me, I could somehow manage by relying on my fellow students, but with "Sada-kko," it was impossible. During the day, I tried selling 인삼 (ginseng). However, ginseng was not selling at all.

Sada-kko, however, was as happy as a liberated lark after coming to Tokyo. For him, who had only grown up in the countryside, the city of Tokyo had a mysterious charm that dazzled his eyes more than anything else.

If I think back to why Sada-kko followed me in the first place, who would say that it wasn't out of a longing for the city that country girls often fall into? As soon as he woke up, he pestered me to wander the streets of Tokyo together. When I said I couldn't go, Sada-kko stamped his feet and went sightseeing alone. In the evening, he limped back home.

-ねえ きんさん! (Hey, Mr. Kim!) I wish I could live in a place like "Marunouchi Building"!
Sada-kko muttered to himself as if everything were boring. At times like that, I could only smile wryly.
-You'll live there.
-But I need to get a job.
-You'll get a job.
-Someone has to hire me. I'd really work if I had a job.
Even so, Sada-kko diligently attended our study groups, which were held occasionally, and listened attentively. Of course, when we were holding a meeting and faced a situation where we couldn't be careless, we asked "Sada-kko" to go out for a while. Even then, he showed no sign of complaint.
-I'll whistle three times, and then I'll come in. If you whistle once, it means wait a little longer, and if you whistle twice, it means wait a little longer. Okay? Please do that… and then he would get up. We couldn't help but laugh at his childlike innocence.
-Does he think we're plotting some grand conspiracy?
-Well, aren't you?
In a day or two, Sada-kko gradually became friendly with my fellow students - whose 민족 (race) was different from his - and occasionally even participated in our discussions. My fellow students, in turn, treated Sada-kko like someone they felt guilty about and joked around with him. Among them, Sada-kko became closest to S. S was a slender, intelligent, and well-off "modern boy (모보·타이프)" student at P University at the time. I respected S's clear theories, and because he had enough money for tuition, I had spent the night at S's boarding house with Sada-kko several times.
When a study group or something ended,
-It makes me happy to see "Sada-kko" growing into our comrade, our trustworthy worker, 허■ (heo-heo), S said, laughing cheerfully.
-さう? (Is that so?) I will work for you. I will not betray you. What about me being a woman? Excuse me! Stop saying such things!
And Sada-kko pouted his lips.

The day after arriving in Tokyo, I took Sada-kko to the place where his older brother was hiding in "Asakusa". However, the place where they had been was empty, and more than half of the glass in the front door was broken, and the small lock that secured the front door was covered in dust. I went around the house to the back door, but it was unlocked. I shouted, wondering if anyone was there, but there was no answer. I pushed open the broken wooden door and went inside. A few books were piled on a broken "hondade (本棚)" that must have been placed there sometime, covered in dust, and the rain had soaked through to the inner pages. It seemed that something had happened to "Asano" while I was hiding in the countryside.

I returned to the house - C's boarding house - and asked C about "Asano," but he also said he didn't know.
After that, whenever I met a fellow student and thought of "Asano," I asked about him. No one who knew Asano knew anything about him.
-Then did he go in again?
I had things to ask Asano and things to discuss - all related to the Sada-kko incident - but three weeks passed without any news of him.
One very chilly night, I took advantage of a rare moment of leisure and went to visit a comrade "Yamada" who lived in "Shosokcheon-gu" with Sada-kko. Fortunately, "Yamada" was also home, so we sat around the brazier and started chatting. The first thing that came up in the conversation was news about Sada-kko's older brother.
-Well, "Yamada" said worriedly,
-I haven't seen him for a month either.
-What's wrong?
Sada-kko also frowned.
We talked about a Japanese activist who had drowned in a well and about the misfortunes of my fellow Koreans, one by one. At that moment, the front door suddenly slid open, and
-メン 야마다와? (Excuse me, is Yamada here?)
a deep voice rang out. Sada-kko instantly recognized it with the intuition of a bright woman.
-Oh, it sounds like my brother!
-Yeah, it does!
"Yamada" quickly got up and ran down the stairs. I glanced at Sada-kko's face. Her lips were slightly parted, and her eyes were darting around, as if she were very disturbed.
I looked directly at Sada-kko as if asking something. Then, as if calming herself, Sada-kko said to herself,
-だつて かまわないわ (But it doesn't matter).
The visitor was indeed "Asano". As soon as he opened the door and stepped inside,
-Brother!
Sada-kko stood up to greet him. However, "Asano" didn't seem surprised for some reason. "Yamada" asked.
-Where have you been all this time?
"Asano" didn't answer that question but looked at me and greeted me happily.
-Hey, Kim Taek-i! No, "Eshima"! When did you come? Did you have a good trip? Is everything okay now? and held out his hand.
-I had a good trip, but what about you?
We sat back around the brazier. "Asano's" face was very haggard. Only then did he slowly open his mouth and say,
-I've been to the countryside for about a month. I was too busy to tell you (Yamada) and left.
-What for? Where to?
-To the Kansai region on business? I'll tell you the story later. In short, it was to inform the comrades in the Kansai region about the damage our movement in the Kanto region suffered during this disaster.
"Asano's" eyes then turned to "Sada-kko".
-What are you doing here?
-I came to work in Tokyo.
-Did you follow Mr. Kim?
-Yes.
An undeniable unpleasantness crossed "Asano's" gaunt face. As was his habit at such times, his right eyebrow twitched up and down. However, he didn't try to ask about this matter any further. I also wondered what to do but decided to postpone the story of what had happened and kept my mouth shut for the time being.
When we left "Yamada's" house, it was almost eleven o'clock. We walked along the streetcar tracks. I was thinking about the Sada-kko incident, small and repeated. I couldn't keep quiet any longer, so I spoke first.
-What do you think about bringing "Sada-kko"?
-Were you in love with her?
-Well, if you say so, then yes.
-No, it's not like that. Of course, I loved "Kin-sang", but more than that, I wanted to come to Tokyo and work for the poor and unfortunate.
-Work? In Tokyo?
-Why can't I? Yes, Brother.
"Asano's" right eyebrow twitched again.
-You need to think carefully about whether you came to Tokyo because of the "love" of a thoughtless girl or because you longed for the glamorous things in the city.
-But that's too much. I've thought about it all.
I was quite agitated by "Asano's" attitude. Did he really trust me as a comrade when he said such things? If so, it was too much of a belittlement of Sada-kko. If not, did he think of me as some kind of rogue who seduces girls? But then again, it was not strange that he would feel unpleasant, as he didn't know the details yet. Since I was being given a place to hide, if I were to steal his own sister, who was still innocent, he wouldn't be happy about it right away.
But, if I may-
Just as I was about to make an excuse, a streetcar came from behind. Looking up, we had already reached the Higher Normal School stop.
-Well, let's meet again. I'm going to take the streetcar. Where are you staying now?
-Tonight, we're sleeping at K's house in "So-shigaya". What about you?
-"Fukagawa"
-Anyway, "Asano" said as he went to catch the streetcar,
-Think again about whether you're not doing something shameful as a comrade.
I heard a difficult-to-resolve misunderstanding and an unmistakable animosity in "Asano's" words. I was also agitated and, looking at the streetcar that was about to leave, said,
-You should think more calmly! Everything will be resolved by our future actions!
The streetcar left.
-Why is oppa (옵바) being so cold!
Sada-kko said in a tearful voice and pouted. Icy raindrops were falling sparsely. We didn't try to quicken our pace.

11
Life with Sada-kko became increasingly difficult. The used books that I had been selling, one or two at a time, to make pocket money were now gone. Even if I could get meals from my fellow students, it had been a day or two, and my heart was naturally apologetic.
Even if I notified my family, I knew very well that they were in a situation where they couldn't even afford five won, but I couldn't help but write a letter home. As expected, I didn't receive a single yeopjeon (엽전) from home, but instead, I received a letter from my father, a dried-up old scholar, with the ink of the old days still fresh. It was a renewed complaint about the state of the "family" that was going to ruin, mixing in very strong sentimental words.
I couldn't help but be overcome by a gloomy mood. Sada-kko, who was watching beside me, asked,
-What is it?
-It's a letter from my family saying they're starving to death!
-Why is that? Our rural home is also declining every year for some reason.
-That's because, S joined in the conversation, -in the capitalist era, farmers are exploited ×× doubly. First by the landlords, and second by the cities. In colonies, they are exploited ×× triply. That's why rural people, even though there's no famine and they don't live extravagantly, their livelihoods get harder every year. It's unbelievable.
-Really? It's unbelievable.
Sada-kko's eyes, which looked intelligent, sparkled as she agreed with S's clear explanation.
Finally, I gave up on the vague business of selling ginseng and decided to become a factory worker. It wasn't just me, but the organization we were involved with at the time had decided to rebuild the factories where the organization had been destroyed by the earthquake in order to promote the development of the movement, and to insert new cells into the factories where there was no organization yet. As a result, I was allowed to participate in it along with six Japanese comrades.
I was assigned to the raw material sorting department of the N Jeong ×× paper mill not far from Tokyo. Because I didn't have skilled skills, there was no other work I could do. My job was to stand all day in a mountain of old, dirty waste paper and sort out other miscellaneous trash. I was called a factory worker, but in reality, it was no different from doing manual labor. Of course, I used my somewhat fluent Japanese again to act as "Eshima Kasuo (江島·가스오)".
Taking that opportunity, I tried to take Sada-kko there as well and spoke to the noodle factory there, but there were no vacancies. On top of that, Sada-kko herself didn't seem to want to enter into such activities - activities that were completely isolated from all "honor" and didn't stand out to others - so I had no choice but to leave her in Tokyo as she was. I went to see her older brother, but he still insisted on sending Sada-kko back to the countryside, and Sada-kko pouted her lips and objected to it, so in the end, Sada-kko continued to wander around as she had before.
Once a week, usually on Saturday nights, I boarded the high-speed electric railway, bought a round-trip ticket for one won and thirty-six jeon, and went to Tokyo to meet Sada-kko. We usually met at S's boarding house, as S's room was a spacious eight-mat room.
Fellow students such as K and C would usually come to S's room and tell all sorts of stories. Sada-kko and I would eat senbei (煎餅) together and chat cheerfully. The center of the conversation was the magazine that we were trying to publish at the time. When I came in, Sada-kko would jump up and greet me, saying,
-Oh! Kin-sang, I've been waiting so long. Your face is getting thinner and thinner. How busy you must be.
Her attitude was so comrade-like and wife-like. I felt as if my tired body was becoming refreshed. But at the same time, I felt uneasy. Sada-kko is young. My fellow students are young. Wouldn't it be harmful to Sada-kko to leave them like this?
At that time, I was actually in love with Sada-kko. When I saw her growing as our comrade day by day, I also felt the joy of having created a worker with my own strength. Of course, I cannot make Sada-kko "my person". But I also love Sada-kko's "woman". I sometimes even had absurd, ominous fantasies about Sada-kko.
On a Monday in mid-January - that day, I felt unusually uneasy. The organization inside the factory was gradually taking shape, and that evening, seven comrades gathered to first organize a union in our factory alone, and then gradually combine all the paper mills in that neighborhood - N Jeong (N町) - to establish a strong union, and at the same time, to establish the N Jeong (N町) branch of the All-Japan Labor Union. Even if we left out the distant future, the preparations for establishing the union in our factory alone were clearly ready. I only finished the important discussions that day and quickly left for Tokyo. I felt responsible for not finishing the work, but among the comrades there, there was "Sano," a reliable, experienced worker who was a true proletarian, so he could easily handle the rest of the minor tasks even without me. Still, responsibility is responsibility, whether big or small. But at that time, I was a young man of twenty-three. Moreover, I couldn't go to Tokyo on the Saturday before last because the important discussions hadn't finished. When I went on the Saturday before last, I had said in advance that I might not be able to go, but still, Sada-kko might have been waiting for me. Sitting on the comfortably rocking cushion of the high-speed electric train, which was running at a pleasant speed of one hour and fifty miles, I forgot about the slightly unpleasant thoughts I had had about Sada-kko for the past month and sang a verse of the popular "Garesu Step" song in a thin voice.

집으로통지한댓자 나의집에서는 인제는 단오원돈을 엇더케할수업는처지가되엇슴은나도잘아는바이엇지만 엇지하는수업시 집으로편지해보앗다 그러나 예긔대로집에서는 엽전한닙오지안이하고 그대신아버지의밧삭마른모가오들오들선 녯날선비의글시그대로인 ᆯ드막한편지가왓다 몹시나쎈틔멘탈한 문자를석거가며 멸망해가는「집안」형편을 새삼스레 하소연한것이엿다。
나는 침울한긔분에잡히지안이할수업섯다 엽헤서보는 사다가
-무엇이에요?
-우리집에서온 굴머들죽게되엿다는 편지라우!
-웨들그럴가요? 우리싀골집도 해마다 웬심인지몰으게 패망해들어가니오。
-그것은요 하고 S가이야기에참례한다-자본주의시대에는 농민은 이중으로 ××를당하고잇기문이지요 첫재는지주에게 둘재는도회에게 식민지에잇서서는그러닛가 삼중으로 ××를당하는 세음이지요 그문에 싀골사람은 별로흉년이든것도안이오 별로사치를한것도안이것만 살님사리는 해마다 달마다궁해들어가는것입니다 긔가막히는노릇이지요。
-정말요 긔가맥히는노릇이에요。
사다는 총명해보이는 눈을반작이며 S의명쾌한설명에 찬성하는것이엿다。
드듸어 나는 인삼장사니무엇이니하는 희지부지한수작을집어치우고, 공장로동자로들어가기를결심하엿다 그것은 하필나안이라 그우리들이 관계하고잇든단체에서 운동의발전을하기위하야 지진문에조직이부서진공장에는 그것을다시건설하고 아즉조직이업는공장에는 새로한세포를집어넛키를결의한결과 여섯사람의일본동지들과함나도그것에참가케된것이엿다。
나는동경서멀지안이한N정××제지공장의원료정선부로 들어가게되엿다 나는 숙련한긔슬이업섯기문에 그박게는맛허할만한일이업섯다 하로종일 산가치싸인헌누덱이 휴지속에들어서서 그외의잡동산이쓰러기를 골나내는것이 나의맛흔일이엿다 말은공장로동자이엿스나 실상은막버리과별로틀님이업섯다 물론나는 나의약간류창한일본말을 리용하야다시「에시마·가스오」의 행세를하엿다。
그것을긔회로 사다도 그곳으로데리고가랴고 그곳제면공장에말을너어보앗스나 자리가업섯다 그우에 사다자신도 별로히그러한활동-모든「명예」와 완전히격리된남의눈에이지안이하는활동-으로들어오랴는긔색이보이지안이하엿슴으로 할수업시 그대로동경에다 두기로하엿다 그의옵바를차저갓스나 그느여전히사다를 도로싀골로내려보내기를주장하고 사다논 입을내미러가며 그것에반대하야 걸국사다는사다대로 그전가티 이리저리로 언처도라단이게되엿다。
일주일에한번식 대개는토요일날밤에 나는 고속도전긔철도에몸을실어 일금삼심륙전의왕복표를사가지고 동경으로사다를맛나러갓다 우리는대개는 S의하숙에서 맛낫다 S의방은팔첩이나되는 넓은방이엿슴으로。
S에게는 일상 K니C니하는동모들이와서 별별이야기를다하고잇섯다 사다와함「센베이」가튼것을먹어가며 유쾌하게드는것이다 이야기의중심은 그우리들이 발간하랴든잡지를싸고도는것이엿다 그런내가 들어가면 사다는 벌덕이러나마조나오며
-아라! 긴상 퍽이나기둘넛세요 얼골이 점점더 야위어들어가세요 얼마니밧부세요。
그의태도는 얼마나동지다웁고 안해다웟다 나는피곤하든몸이 갭분해지는듯이 늣기는것이다 그러나동시에 불안을늣긴다 사다는어리다 동모들은젊다 이대로내버려두는것이 사다를위해 해롭지안이할?
나는 그사실사다를사랑하고잇섯다 그가하로하로 우리의동지로서 성장해가는것을 볼에는 나의힘으로 한사람의일군을 맨들어내엇다는 깃붐도늣기는것이엿다 물논 나는 사다를「내사람」을맨들수는업다 그러나 나는 사다의「녀자」를사랑한다 나는 각금 사다에관해공연히터문이업는불길한공상지하는것이엿다
일월중순의어느월요일날-그날나는예에업시마음이거든거든하엿다 공장안의조직이 차차로형상을갓추게되야 그날저녁시간을리용해 동지일곱사람이모혀서 우선우리의공장만으로조합을조직하야 차차로그동리-N町-에잇는제지공장을총합해 굿세인조합을성립식히고 동시에 전일본노동조합의N정치부를 설립식하자는 결의를한것이엿다 먼일은고만두고라도 우리공장만의 조합은 불일간에성립식힐준비가 력력히다된것이엿다 나는 그날중요한토의만을막고 급히동경으로낫다 일을지하지안은책임을늣겻스나 그곳의동지중에는「사노」라는쏙진프로레타리아의 미듬직한 귀건한일군이잇섯슴으로 남어지의자자분한일은 내가업서도 넉넉히해나갈수잇섯다 그래도책임은책임이다 적든크든책임은책임이다 그럿컨만 그나는스물세살의젊은사나히엿다 더구나 그전전날토요일에는중요한토의가나지안엇기문에동경을가지못하엿다전전토요일날갓슬혹시못갈지도몰은다고 미리말은해두엇지만 그래도 사다는 혹시하고 긔들넛슬는지도몰은다 한시간오십마일의 쾌속력으로닷는 고속도전철의유쾌하게흔들니는 쿠숀에안저 나는요한달재의 사다에대한 약간불쾌한생각을 니저버리고 류행하는「가레스스」의노래의일절을 가는소리로불너보는것이엿다-
