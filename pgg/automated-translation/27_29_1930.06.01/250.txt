Exhibition of Bride Candidates, Free Admission, Hosted by S.S.

It may seem audacious for me to call myself "S.S.," the foremost journalist in the world, but since most matchmakers describe me that way, some people seem to think of me as that great journalist. Rumor has it that "S.S." is planning to get married. Although it didn't appear in newspaper extras in large or small print, the news spread from here to there on its own, and matchmaking proposals and applications began pouring in like people rushing to buy tickets at a train station.

However, even if it's just a rumor, S.S., who is known as the foremost journalist in the world, even at the end of the 20th century, is not foolish enough to find a wife through matchmakers.

I will choose a candidate from among the women I have met, dated, and know directly, but that is not an easy task. Although S.S. is not yet thirty, due to the nature of my profession, I have met, dated, and come to know quite a few young women from schools, young women's associations, churches, sewing schools, night schools, lectures, or friends' homes. While thinking this way and that way, and weighing the options, I took a long break from submitting manuscripts to Kaebyŏk-sa (改闢社).

"You've been away for too long, and readers are sending letters urging you to return, asking if S.S. is dead. How about writing one by one?"

Even the editor of Pyŏlgŏn’gon (別乾坤) at Kaebyŏk-sa (改闢社) came with an unwelcome face.

"Manuscripts or anything else, solving the marriage problem is a crucial issue for me right now... Please wait a little longer. I have no time to think about anything else."

"If someone like S.S. is going to get married, women from all over the world will flock to him like a rising tide. Why is it so difficult to resolve? It's already summer, and people can't read anything well unless it's a peculiar article in the S.S. style, so please write one."

"It may be like a rising tide, but there are too many plausible yet contradictory candidates, making it difficult to resolve." "About how many people are you considering?"

"I know a lot of women, and among them, I've narrowed it down to forty-two or three people who don't seem to dislike me."

"Forty-two or three women competing for one groom?! Only S.S. could do that, but you're too lucky. But the reason S.S. is known and popular is thanks to writing so much in our Pyŏlgŏn’gon (別乾坤), isn't it? So, you should think of that favor and write at least one."

"That's true, but I can't think of anything right now. How can I write?"

"Then I have a good idea. Write a manuscript about your forty-two or three unmarried beautiful women (美處女) who are candidates for your bride. That would be a very profitable manuscript. 'S.S.'s Public Bride Candidate Search' would be a great article." "That, that won't do. I can't do it because it's about my own affairs."

"No, you should write it. Writing it will be a reference for unmarried men and women who haven't married yet. If you write it with S.S.'s stylish seasoning, it will be a lesson in satire (諷刺), and it will be a fun read even on hot summer days. Comforting people tormented by the heat, mosquitoes, and bedbugs would be an act of charity."

"Still, no, no, I absolutely can't do that."

"Why not reveal the strengths, weaknesses, appearance, and personality of those forty-odd people in detail and gather votes from the readers to marry the one who gets the most votes? It's original and good in the S.S. style, isn't it? Let's do it without thinking."

I quietly agreed. Publicly revealing them and marrying the one chosen by the readers was subtly appealing, but I knew that arguing with the Pyŏlgŏn’gon (別乾坤) reporter would only waste more time, as I had never won against them.

Opening Remarks

Ahem, as the host, S.S., I would like to briefly express my greetings, purpose, and hopes for this exhibition.

You all may have guessed the name S.S. from reading the articles I have written, but I believe no one knows the true identity of the person who goes by this strange and mischievous name. I was born and raised in the heart of Seoul, in Tŏn-dong (뎐동) (Kongp’yŏng-dong (公平洞) and Kyŏnji-dong (堅志洞)), but I lost my parents early, and I have no brothers, sisters, uncles, or nephews. I only have an older sister who married early and lives in a faraway place. As a single person, I wandered here and there, passing through Tokyo and Shanghai, briefly visiting Ohio University in the United States. Although I didn't study anything in particular, people say that I must have devoted myself to studying since I had no one to think about or a family to worry about.

Since that's what people say, I don't know if it's true or not, but after returning to Korea, I didn't have any particular job. Since it was just me, I lived very freely, without anything to hinder me. As I met this person and that friend, I unfortunately met newspaper and magazine reporters, and I started writing miscellaneous articles one by one as they asked, and it became a habit. That became an opportunity, and I lived as a newspaper reporter, magazine reporter, and occasionally wrote books. I saved enough money to buy a house, a pump organ, and some cosmetics.

However, I did not advocate for a single life like old maids who had been abroad, but in reality, I had been enjoying the freedom of a single life as long as I could. The reason for that was that I saw so many of my modern friends turn into boiled cabbage (삶어논배추이) within three months of getting married.

Even if they lived with boiled cabbage, it would be fine, but soon after, they would depreciate, and after three depreciations, they would definitely regret it and start worrying. I was afraid to voluntarily do something that almost everyone regrets.

One poet (詩人) came to my boarding house one early evening without a hat. He wasn't a modern sun worshiper who didn't wear a hat; he was such a polite person that he couldn't even go to the bathroom without a hat. He came without a hat and asked for dinner. When I asked what was wrong, he said he had fought with his "wife." He had married a representative beauty who graduated from ○ Hwajeon School (○화전문) only five months ago, and he was the envy of his friends for having all the happiness in the world. It turned out that a certain literary young woman had sent a letter in advance saying that she had something to discuss about her personal affairs, and the fact that she came and talked in the next room became the reason for the fight. His wife had said, "Why did you deceive me and marry me when you had such a good lover?" and meticulously ground the coffee cup that had been taken into the next room into powder. So, after scolding and appeasing, her fighting spirit (鬪爭意識) was finally ignited, and she threw the mandolin box (맨 도링박아지) and ran out. It's obvious where the mandolin box he threw ended up, but anyway, the fact that he ran out without a hat means he was kicked out, doesn't it? I decided that I would never get married if I couldn't even meet a woman who came to visit me after I got married.

One modern reporter who used to be at a certain newspaper, though he doesn't work there anymore, broke off with seolleongtang (설넝탕) (ox bone soup). He was handsome, gentle, talented, spoke foreign languages well, and many young women envied him, but he turned them all down and married a bob-haired woman who came back from Japan. They were like a loving couple, going to movies and taking walks together, but the problem was that he wouldn't let her wear Korean clothes. When he came to the newspaper, he wore a Western suit even if they told him not to, but even at home, when he went to the bathhouse, when he ate, and when he lay down with a sore back for days, he only wore his Western suit. Of course, the bob-haired woman didn't have the qualifications to wear Korean clothes. She refused to qualify even for Western clothes, but she said it was easier to take Western clothes to the laundry, and even if you paid someone to make Korean clothes in the beginning, ironing and sewing them were too much of a hassle.

But you might ask why he broke off with seolleongtang (설넝탕). This person originally "loved Korea" and therefore decided to make a special effort to love Korean customs. He used to praise seolleongtang (설넝탕), saying that Korean customs were full of that unmodern, rustic, and unclean soup. But after getting married, there were more times when rice wasn't going into the pot than when it was, and he was just comfortable. In the morning, his wife would wake up late, so it was decided that it was seolleongtang (설넝탕), and in the evening, they would be late from taking a walk, or they would be tired from taking a walk, or they would be late for the movie. They would habitually advocate for "simplifying daily life" and send a notice to the seolleongtang (설넝탕) restaurant. On days when there was no reason, he would say he had a new type of illness called "I don't feel good today," so he would have seolleongtang (설넝탕) today and seolleongtang (설넝탕) tomorrow, and he finally broke off with it. It would be nice if his wife reflected coolly like a sea breeze because of this break, but if not, it seemed like he would end up breaking off with his wife next, so it was very precarious to watch from the side. I decided that I would never get married if I couldn't eat freshly cooked rice and had to live with my limbs bound in Western clothes.

One of my respected friends, a professor at a certain university, married a virtuous woman who graduated from X school (×화). For some reason, every time I met him, his whole body, especially his upper body (上半身), was covered in wounds. He had wounds on his shoulders, neck, chest, and even his fingers. When I found out, I learned that his virtuous wife was the one who did that. I looked closely at the face of that gentle woman again and again, but it didn't seem like she would do that. I realized that there were secrets in married life that you couldn't imagine just by looking at someone's face, and I resolutely decided against it.

One friend married a woman who had no faults, but she started having babies before he could even save any money, and I saw him tearing his hair out with headaches. I decided that marriage was scary and that I shouldn't get close to it.

I heard a rumor that the wife of a middle school gymnastics teacher, a beautiful woman from a certain women's school, gave her husband's shoes to a pawnbroker and bought taffy. How can I tell you all of this one by one? One way or another, I even developed a habit of feeling sorry for men who got married.

But "time is more important than gold," as everyone has been saying since ancient times, but I have only now realized why time is more important than gold. It's because time has a more skillful harmony than God. Just like time has created all the history in this world, time has a harmony that even changes people's minds. As I approached the age of thirty,

The thought that "marriage is bad because it's done carelessly, but it can be good if done well" began to form at some point, and now it has grown so big that I can't get rid of it even if I try. If it had arisen for a clear reason, it would be easy to get rid of it, but since it arose without any particular reason, there's nothing I can do about it.

In that case, I have to get married, but I haven't advertised that I'm going to get married, and I haven't told anyone, but there are a lot of rumors here and there, and the number of people I know is not small, so the choice is very difficult.

As a coward who knows all the flaws and failures of others, I have been hesitating because I have to choose a truly perfect person. But since the Pyŏlgŏn’gon (別乾坤) reporter, with a trick even more mischievous than S.S., is going to publicly reveal the bride candidates to all the readers in the world and decide on the one who gets the most votes from the readers, I'm thinking of doing just that.

Among the people I know, if I like them, there are over forty people who are waiting without objection to give me an answer. Among them are women who have come back from Japan, women who have come from America, graduates of commercial schools, art schools, nursery schools, and vocational schools, female poets, and female musicians. Of course, they are all modern women (新女性) who have graduated from school. I can't help but feel sorry for the brides who will be revealed here, but this is a crucial issue for my future, and since I am entrusting the selection to the readers, I have no choice but to introduce them in detail to a certain extent without hiding anything.

This is an unreasonable inconvenience for you readers, but since you have already read "S.S."'s articles several times, please regret that bad connection and help me out.

Now, I will guide you to the exhibition hall. Modern women, please come in order in a line, not too boisterously, so that the crowd of women is not too loud. No, no, you can't push the people in front of you like that. One by one, one by one. (To be continued in the next issue)
