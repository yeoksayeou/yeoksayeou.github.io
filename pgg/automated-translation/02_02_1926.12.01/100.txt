Ttongsŭrang ttaeng!
						Hyosan

On the banks of the Simyanggang (潯陽江) River, where autumn leaves and reeds sway in the chilly, desolate wind—a late autumn day where, had Paek Nakch'ŏn (白樂天) been alive, he might have sung the song, "Hearing the sound of the pipa played by a woman from Kyŏngsŏng (京城女) echoing from the river, I will write the 'Song of the Pipa' (琵琶行) for you, so please sit again and play one more tune"—seek out the deep alley of Ch'ŏngnyangsa (淸凉寺) Temple outside the sparsely visited Tongdaemun Gate.

There, you will hear the sound of a beggar—with a pitch-black face stained with grime, clad in blood-stained, worn-out rags, leaning on a broken stick as a cane, limping on both legs, going before this patron and that patron, singing in a trembling, half-mute voice, begging for a penny or two.

The beggar bows deeply and sings this song:

Ttongsŭrang ttaeng! Ttongsŭrang ttaeng!
The birch tree on the back hill,
Is all used up as wood for the young lady's red laundry paddle.
Ttongsŭrang ttaeng! Ttongsŭrang ttaeng!
The pasqueflower on the back hill,
Whether old or young, it is bent over.
Ttongsŭrang ttaeng! Ttongsŭrang ttaeng!

However, his singing is not that good, yet he sings with his head tilted, seemingly quite pleased with himself.

After singing a few verses like this, he changes the direction of his song.

Ttongsŭrang ttaeng! Ttongsŭrang ttaeng!
Dear patrons! Dear patrons!
Please listen to my story! Please listen to my story!
I, too, in days gone by, long, long ago, in Yangju, Kyŏnggi Province,
Was the son of a wealthy family owning a thousand sŏk (천석군이 부가자),
Lived in fine clothes and ate fine food, wanting for nothing.
In the prime of my youth, at twenty-eight,
I found a partner, a daughter from a good family (량가규수),
And we enjoyed marital bliss.<26>
Mother, oh mother, my mother,
Said she disliked seeing her new daughter-in-law,
Found fault with her and chased her out.
For thirty years of spring breezes and autumn moons,
I longed for her all alone.

The patrons, who had been listening with amusement until now, all showed solemn and sorrowful expressions on their faces as the song reached this point.

The beggar continues his song in an even more mournful voice.

My home, oh my home,
My fine siblings all stepped forward,
Stirred up and sold off the grand houses and fields north and south,
And when I was scattered and wandering as a beggar (류리개걸),
This body of mine, unable to distinguish jade from stone (옥석구분),
Had nothing to do but end up in this state.
Thinking of my former wife,
I yearned to see her, my heart burning,
But wandered, not knowing where she went.
Then, three years ago from now,
I discovered her at Yŏngdosa Temple,
Entertaining a group of patrons, laughing merrily.
I tried to greet her,
But my former wife acted as if she barely saw me,
A sniff was her only reception.
Only, only my former wife's younger sibling (내의처제),
Pitying my disabled body,
Handed me a bag of sweets.
After that, at Anjŏngsa Temple,
I met her again and greeted her,
But she just looked past me indifferently, saying nothing.
Only, only my former wife's younger sibling,
Pitying my disabled body,
Gave me the food she had been eating.
Ttongsŭrang ttaeng! Ttongsŭrang ttaeng!

The song ended here. Was it the random outpouring of a mentally ill person? Was it a rehearsed tale picked up somewhere? The eyes of all the patrons focused on the beggar's face. But the beggar still had a look on his face filled with what seemed like a genuinely felt emotion. Here and there, 10-chŏn silver coins and 5-chŏn nickel coins went, one penny, two pennies, into the beggar's pouch. (End)<27>

**Summary**

This literary piece by Hyosan describes an encounter with a beggar near Ch'ŏngnyangsa Temple in late autumn 1926. The beggar sings a song that starts nonsensically but transitions into a tragic life story: born wealthy, married happily, but his wife was driven out by his mother. His siblings squandered the family fortune, leaving him a disabled beggar. He recounts painfully seeing his estranged wife years later, living well but treating him with disdain, though her sibling showed some pity. The listeners, initially amused, are moved by his tale and give him money. The author leaves the truth of the story ambiguous. From a historical perspective, the article offers a glimpse into the social realities of colonial Korea: the presence of poverty and beggary, traditional family conflicts persisting alongside changing social dynamics (the wife's apparent independence or new life), the stark class differences, and the common trope of beggars using tragic narratives for survival. The specific locations (Tongdaemun, Ch'ŏngnyangsa) ground the story in the outskirts of Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul), highlighting spaces often occupied by the marginalized.

똥그랑땡!
						曉山
단풍닙 갈때꼿에 찬바람 쓸쓸한 심양강(潯陽江) 머리, 백락천(白樂天)이 살어 잇엇더면 강상에서 울려오는 경성녀(京城女)의 타는 비파소리를 듯고 『널 위하야 비파행(琵琶行)을 쓸터이니 다시 안저 한 곡조를 더 타다오.』하던 노래를 불을만한 느진 가을날 님떠러 저 가지 드믄 동대문 밧 청량사(淸凉寺) 깁흔 골목을 차저 드러가보라.
숙 그런머뤀¬ 샛가만 얼골에 때뭇고 피무든 헌누덕이를 걸처입고 부러진 막댁이 집행이 삼어 두 다리를 절뚝거리며 이 손님 저 손님압헤가 떨리는 반벙어리 소리로 노래부르며 한푼두푼 애걸하는 소리를 드르리라.
그 비렁이는 허리를 굽신하고는 이런 노래를 부른다.
똥그랑 땡! 똥그랑 땡!
뒷동산의 박달나무는
작은아씨네 홍독개 방망이 깜으로 다나간다.
똥그랑 땡! 똥그랑 땡!
뒷동산의 할미꼿은
늙으나 젊으나 고부라젓네
똥그랑 땡! 똥그랑 땡!
그러나 그 소리는 그러케 잘 하는 소리가 못되지만 그래도 그는 가장 득의양양 한드시 고개를 갸웃거리며 부르고잇다.
한창 이와가튼 노래를 몃곡조 부르고는 노래의 머리를 다른 곳으로 두른다.
똥그랑 땡! 똥그랑 땡!
여러분네 손님들아! 여러분네 손님들아!
내 신세를 드러봄쇼! 내 신세를 드러봄쇼!
나도나도 전날전날 네 전날은 경긔도라 양주따에
천석군이 부가자(富家子)로
호의호식 남부럴 것 업섯다네
이팔청춘 조흔때에
량가규수 짝을어더
금실우지 즐겻더니＜26＞
엄마엄마 우리엄마
새며느리 보기실타
탈을 잡어 내여쫏차
30년간 춘풍추월
나 혼자서 그렷다네
지금까지 웃고듯던 손님들도 노래가 여긔까지 이르르매 누구나 다가치 얼골에 엄숙하고 처연(凄然)한 빗이 뵈엿다.
비렁이도 더욱더욱 처량한 소리로 노래를 계속한다.
집도집도 우리집은
잘난형제 모다나서
고루거각 남전북답
들뷔셔서 팔어먹고
류리개걸 헛허질제
옥석구분 이내몸도
할 일업시 이 신세라
녜 전 안해 생각나서
보고지고 애가타되
간곳몰나 방황터니
지금부터 삼년전에
무리손님 모시고서
희희락락 노는 것을
영도사서 발견하고
아는체를 하엿더니
녜 전 안해 본듯만 듯
코우숨이 대접일네
다만다만 내의처제(妻弟)
병신몸을 불상타고
과자한봉 집어주고
그 후다시 안정사에
재차맛나 인사하되
본숭만숭 그저말고
다만다만 내의처제
병신몸이 불상타고
먹던밥을 다시주네
똥그랑 땡! 똥그랑 땡!
노래는 여기서 끗이낫다. 정신병자의 함부로 나온 소리인가? 어대서 드러익힌 군소리인가? 뭇 손님의 두눈들은 비렁이의 얼골로 시선(視線)이 모여가고 마럿다. 그러나 그 비렁이는 여전히 진실한 무슨 감촉을 참으로 바든듯한 모양이 얼골에 가득하엿다. 여긔저긔서 10전 은화, 5전 백동화가 한푼씩 두푼씩 비렁이의 주머니 속으로 드러갓다.(끗)＜27＞
