Mr. Yu Chint'ae (兪鎭泰) was a guardian of the house for the Korean Education Society (朝鮮敎育會). No one could help but admire his diligence and sincerity (誠勤). When he speaks, he customarily pushes his graying hair straight forward, and just as a Blue Mountain Tiger (靑山老虎) might bring back a plump female dog it has caught, unable to eat it for lack of teeth, and just growls and growls alone, he twitches his large eyes and large mouth left and right; he also sometimes sits cross-legged with his long legs and then stands up again. As for his preferences, there isn't much to note specifically, but among foods, apart from singling out tobacco, he greatly likes white rice cakes (흰떡/白餠). Being short of money, whenever he passes a rice cake shop and sees freshly pounded white rice cakes steaming, or sees white rice cake prepared as a side dish at a standing bar, no matter how much the old man tries to maintain his dignity, saliva inevitably flows, and it's said he sometimes takes a handkerchief out from his bosom.<33>

**Summary**

This short piece describes Yu Chint'ae, an employee of the Korean Education Society, focusing on his diligent nature, physical mannerisms (like pushing his hair forward and twitching his face while speaking), and a particular fondness for white rice cakes (흰떡). Despite his age and apparent lack of funds, his craving for this specific food is strong enough to make him visibly react when seeing it. From a historical perspective, the article offers a glimpse into the everyday life and personal quirks of an individual associated with a Korean cultural organization during the colonial period. It highlights the presence and activities of groups like the Korean Education Society and subtly touches upon the economic realities faced by some Koreans, even those holding positions in such organizations, through the detail about Yu's fondness for an inexpensive food item despite being poor.

各人各色 (其三)
兪鎭泰씨는 朝鮮敎育會의 집 직힘이엿다. 그의 誠勤은 누구나 感服치 안이치 못 한다. 말할때이면 히끗히끗한 머리를 의례 압흐로 쭈악쭈악하고 마치 靑山老虎가 살진 암캐를 무러다 노코 니가 업서 먹지를 못하고 혼자 으르릉 으르릉 하듯이 그 큰 눈과 큰 입을 좌우로 실눅실눅 하기도 하며 또 긴다리로 각금 책상다리를 하고 안젓다 이러낫다 한다. 그 이 기호로. 말하면 별로 이럿타 할 것이 업스나 음식중으로는 담배를 특기하는 외에 흰떡(白餠)을 매우 조와하는데 돈이 넉넉지 못한 그는 떡집을 지내다가 흰떡을 새로처서 김이 무룩무룩 나는 것을 보든지, 또 선술집에서 흰떡 안주 맨드러노흔 것을 보면 아모리 노인이 점잔을 피우랴 하야도 침이 저절로 흘너서 각금 품속에서 수건을 끄낸다고 한다.＜33＞
