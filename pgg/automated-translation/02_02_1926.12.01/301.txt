A Partial Preview of Our Magazine's New Year Issue, Destined to be a Grand Spectacle at the Start of the New Year

Undercover Reporter Secret Investigation (First Public Release)
The stage may be bright, but the world is dark! Who can guarantee that those not caught by the net of the law are without sin? There is nothing fouler than allowing unforgivable evils to be covered up unknowingly, and letting unpardonable sinners conduct themselves brazenly. Our magazine, having considered this, has decided to activate one or two male or female undercover reporters each month to investigate the dark shadows that persist even under the sun. Who did the reporter chosen for the first installment disguise themselves as, where did they go, and what did they uncover? Incomparably thrilling! Readers will read the New Year issue and shout "Bravo!" repeatedly.

Tales of Hardship from Reporters of Each Newspaper's Society Desk
There is likely no profession as interesting as that of a 'newspaper reporter,' and among newspaper reporters, there is likely no work as full of interest as that of a 'Society Desk' reporter. To deliver the daily new news to the populace, they go to fires. They go to fight scenes. They handle murder cases. They encounter robbers. And sometimes, they conduct investigative activities surpassing even police detectives. Furthermore, their notebooks hold records more chaotic and secret than a detective's notebook. Their tales of hardship!! Listening to their hardships, more interesting than detective novels, is truly a fascinating affair.

New Spring's Three Major Magazine-Sponsored Features

Exhibition of New Year's Customs from the Thirteen Provinces
Who says our Chosŏn of three thousand ri mountains and rivers is narrow and small? In terms of land, perhaps, but in terms of customs, habits, language, and systems, it is strangely diverse and different. Our people live from the southern island of Chejudo, the detached old land of Tamna, to the north where Paektusan stands tall and the two great rivers, Tuman and Amrok, flow! Look at the exhibition of New Year's customs from various regions presented on the pages of the New Year issue. You will be able to sightsee the entire Eight Provinces' Mountains and Rivers while sitting down………….

Street Exhibition of Modern Unusual Occupations
Who was it that said, "The throat is the police bureau"?... For the sake of eating, there are many strange occupations in this world that we couldn't even dream of. As the world progresses, new occupations gradually<88> increase. In Chosŏn these days, in today's brightened yet impoverished Chosŏn, how many unusual occupations must have emerged... Look at this strange exhibition opening on the pages of the New Year issue! See the existence of various unexpected occupations of all shapes and colors. This will not merely end as an interesting affair.

Kyŏngsŏng Various Shops Signboard Evaluation Meeting
How much has the commercial knowledge of the Korean people increased? How much has their eye for commerce opened? Instead of just sitting around idly chattering about 'living or dying,' one must step out tentatively, tentatively. With a topknot on the head, a long pipe in the mouth, spitting phlegm noisily in front of the shop—with such moldy old business methods, failure in today's economic world is a foregone conclusion. If so, with what kind of designs and policies are businesses being managed? Look at this evaluation meeting conducted through actual on-site inspection, touring various city streets. In today's economic ruin, this too will not be a meaningless affair.

Views on Famous Men, Scholars, and Women from Various Fields
The Koreans active in Chosŏn! Figures from the Education World, Business World, Literary Arts World, Religious World, students studying abroad, and even the Flower and Willow World (Hwaryugye - entertainment/courtesan districts) – critiqued, investigated, observed, satirized, and praised in a hundred faces and hundred ways. It will truly feel like viewing a grand exhibition of photographs of Chosŏn's men and women. Those curious about what kind of figures and what appearances will emerge on the pages, wait with joy. How grand and detailed it will be……….

Special Grand Prize Contest for One Thousand People
A special prize contest problem that men and women, old and young, can all solve together, offering interest and the chance to win a prize! On a snowy, idle winter night, gather with the whole family in a warm ondol room, solve it enjoyably, harmoniously, laughing and chatting. This plan, an unprecedented grand prize contest, is hard to hear of in the magazine world! Hurry, hurry, order the New Year issue and wait. Detailed rules are written there. Don't forget the secret: "The swift-footed gets it first."<89>

**Summary**

This article is an advertisement previewing the contents of the upcoming New Year's issue of the magazine *Pyŏlgŏn'gon* (별건곤) from December 1926. It enthusiastically promotes several major features: an exposé by an undercover reporter investigating hidden societal evils, interviews with newspaper society reporters about their thrilling work, a "paper exhibition" showcasing diverse New Year's customs across Korea's thirteen provinces, a feature on unusual modern occupations emerging in Chosŏn, an evaluation of Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul) shop signboards reflecting on modern business practices, and profiles/critiques of prominent Korean figures from various fields, including entertainers. Finally, it announces a large-scale prize contest open to all readers. For historians, the article offers insights into popular culture and media in 1920s colonial Korea, reflecting societal concerns (crime, poverty leading to unusual jobs), burgeoning interest in modern journalism and business methods, efforts to document and preserve national culture (regional customs), and the magazine's strategy to engage readers through sensationalism, diverse content, and interactive contests. The mention of evaluating modern shop signs and discussing figures from the "Flower and Willow World" alongside intellectuals points to the dynamic and sometimes contradictory social landscape of the time.
