**Summary**

This article from 1926 presents mortality statistics from Sweden, comparing death rates per thousand people across different age groups (30s, 40s, 50s, 60s) for single, married, and "difficult to marry/widowed" individuals, broken down by gender. The data consistently shows that married individuals generally have lower mortality rates than single or "difficult to marry/widowed" individuals, particularly among men.

The article highlights the social and perhaps economic pressures of the time, reflected in the separate category for those "difficult to marry/widowed," suggesting societal concerns about marital status and its impact on well-being. The relative statistical detail, though from a foreign country, hints at an increasing interest in quantitative social science and public health within Korean intellectual circles.
