One Man, One Writing, Origin of All Things

						忙中閑人

In the book *Shenxian Zhuan* (*神仙傳*), there is a story about the creation of the world. It says that when Pan Gu (*盤古*) died, all things were created from his body. It says, "When Pan Gu (*盤古氏*) died, his breath became wind and clouds, his voice became thunder, his sweat and tears became rain and dew, his eyes became the sun and moon, his four limbs and five organs became the Five Peaks (*五岳*), his blood and oily fluids became rivers, lakes, and seas, his sinews became roads, his hair became grass and trees, his bones became metal and stone, his flesh became fields and land, and the lice that lived on his body became people." The origin of man is a masterpiece among masterpieces.＜29＞
