The Transformation of the Seoul Marketplaces
						李 Chunghwa

I. The Origin of the Marketplaces

"Left the ancestral shrine, right the altar of land and grains" or "front the court, behind the market" were the standard principles for establishing a nation and setting up a capital in the Orient. The market was not only crucial for the trade of the people but also vital for the needs of the state. From the Three Kingdoms period, Korea established marketplaces (市廛) in the capital to secure the settled merchants (坐賈) and set up markets in the countryside to facilitate itinerant merchants (行商). The exchange of goods occurred daily in the city marketplaces, while in the countryside, markets opened on the 1st and 6th, 2nd and 7th, 3rd and 8th, 4th and 9th, and 5th and 10th days of each month, which was called "one month six markets" (一月六場).

Examining the establishment of marketplaces today, there's no record of them in Goguryeo (高句麗) or Baekje (百濟). However, in the 2nd year of King Soji (炤智王) of Silla (新羅) (490 AD), the court first opened marketplaces (市肆) in the capital to facilitate the flow of goods from all directions. This not only marked the creation of marketplaces in the Silla capital but also served as a precursor to the marketplaces of later Gaeseong (開城) and Seoul.

Subsequently, in the first month of spring in the 10th year of King Jijeung (智證王) (509 AD), the East Market (東市) was established in the capital, along with the office of East Market Administration (東市典), staffed with two directors (監), two senior officers (大舍), three scribes (書生), and four clerks (史) to manage it. In the 4th year of King Hyoso (孝昭王) (695 AD), the West and South Markets (西南兩市) were established, along with West Market Administration (西市典) and South Market Administration (南市典), each with the same staff as the East Market Administration.

Judging from this, King Jijeung's 10th year was only 20 years after King Soji's 12th year. The markets developed rapidly after King Soji established the marketplaces. To further boost their prosperity, it became necessary to organize them. King Jijeung chose the eastern part of the capital, centered around Geumseong (金城) and Banwolseong (半月城), where people gathered easily, and established marketplaces there, appointing officials to protect and manage them.

Silla's national power expanded, eventually conquering Baekje and Goguryeo to achieve unification in the 8th year of King Munmu (文武王) (668 AD), exactly 179 years after King Soji's 12th year. By this time, the development of the Silla capital must have been extraordinary, and the East Market alone could not provide enough convenience for the people. Therefore, establishing the West and South Markets in the 4th year of King Hyoso, 27 years after unification, was a rational measure suited to the times. It also shows that the development of the Silla capital progressed from east to west and south.

In the 2nd year of Cheonsu (天授) (918 AD), Taejo (太祖) of Goryeo (高麗) established the capital in Songak (松岳), built palaces, set up government offices, and divided the city into five districts (五部) to organize its structure. At this time, marketplaces were also established. Later, in the 7th month of autumn in the 4th year of King Huijong (熙宗) (1208 AD), the arcades (長廊) on the left and right sides of the grand market (大市) were renovated, spanning 1008 bays (楹) from Gwanghwamun (廣化門) to the crossroads (十字街). From this, we can understand the location of the marketplaces at the beginning of Taejo's establishment of the capital. Being 291 years after Taejo's 2nd year, major repairs were necessary.
<70>

Just as Silla placed officials to manage the marketplaces, Goryeo established the Capital Market Office (京市署) to oversee the inspection of the marketplaces. Separately, the Arcade Directorate (行廊都監) was established to manage the construction and repair of the marketplaces. When King Huijong renovated the grand market arcades, he appointed not only the existing commissioners (使) and vice-commissioners (副使) but also a special superintendent (別監) from the rank of minister (宰樞), indicating the importance of the renovation project at that time. However, at one point, the Grand Market Office (大市司) was established in addition to the Capital Market Office, seemingly to manage matters specifically related to the grand market.

1 It is said that during Silla's heyday, the capital had 178,936 households, 1,360 wards, and 55 villages.

2 Gwanghwamun (廣化門) was the south gate (or east gate, according to some) of Yeongheung Palace (延慶宮), whose area included the current Manwoldae (滿月臺) and its surrounding area, where the Hall of Rejoicing (會慶殿), the Hall of Completion of Virtue (訖德殿), and other halls were located. Byeongbu Bridge (兵部橋), also known as Byeonggyo (兵橋) for short, was located east of this gate.

3 An arcade (行廊) is a long corridor built by the state, also called a public corridor (公廊) or government corridor (官廊).

4 During the Goryeo Dynasty, many standing organizations (常設機關) existed, but in the Joseon Dynasty, the Directorate (都監) became a temporary organization (臨時機關) established whenever there were major state projects or ceremonies.

II. Establishment of Marketplaces

538 years ago, Taejo (太祖) of Joseon (朝鮮) founded the nation and, in the third year of his reign, 1394 AD, established the capital in Hanyang (漢陽). He built the Royal Ancestral Shrine (太廟) and palaces, and constructed city walls, gradually progressing with the construction of the new capital. The establishment of marketplaces occurred six years after establishing the capital, after Taejo abdicated the throne.

According to records, in the second month of spring in the first year of King Jeongjong (定宗) (1399 AD), approximately 800 bays (間) of arcades (行廊) were first established on both sides of the main road (大路) from Hyejeong Bridge (惠政橋) to the entrance of Changdeok Palace (昌德宮). Vagrants (游手) and monks (僧徒) from the countryside were gathered and provided with food to perform the labor. This was the initial establishment of the Seoul marketplaces. 74 years later, in the 3rd year of King Seongjong (成宗) (1472 AD), the marketplaces were too small, and the population was too large, leading to theft and robbery by dishonest individuals and congestion by military horses, causing many injuries. Therefore, a royal decree (傳敎) was issued, ordering the division of the market stalls (市肆) from the entrance of Yeonji-dong (蓮地洞) to Doneuimun (敦義門) stone bridge (石橋) to achieve appropriate density. This extended the marketplaces east and west. However, the Ministry of Taxation (戶曺) stated that the terrain from Samganbyeongmun (三間屛門) to Doneuimun stone bridge was narrow, and gathering people near Changdeok Palace, Jongmyo (宗廟), and Uigeumbu (義禁府) would be unsuitable. They requested that the marketplaces be arranged to the left and right from Ilyeongdae (日影臺) to Yeonjidong Bridge (蓮池洞橋). This led to the second expansion of the marketplaces, extending only to the east of the original area.

194 years after the establishment of the marketplaces, in the 25th year of King Seonjo (宣祖) (1592 AD), the Imjin War (壬辰板蕩) occurred. 28 years later, in the 11th year of Gwanghaegun (光海君) (1619 AD), a massive fire broke out from Jongnu (鐘樓) to Donghyeon (銅峴) and Nambyeolgung (南別宮), burning down over several thousand houses and causing many deaths of people and livestock. 19 years after this disaster, in the 14th year of King Injo (仁祖) (1637 AD), during the Byeongja Horan (丙子胡亂), enemy soldiers burned down the arcades and government offices (公舍) inside the city on December 26th. This was the greatest catastrophe and disaster since the establishment of the marketplaces.
<71>

For the next 97 years, there were no fires in the marketplaces. However, in the 9th year of King Yeongjo (英祖) in October (1733 AD), the 13th year of the same king in September (1737 AD), the 20th year of the same king in September (1744 AD), the 37th year of the same king in October (1761 AD), and the 47th year of the same king in March (1771 AD), the marketplaces burned down. King Yeongjo reigned for 52 years, the longest reign among the Joseon kings. Given this long reign, fires in the marketplaces occurred frequently, averaging about once every ten years.

Originally, the establishment of the marketplaces was a state project. Whenever a major fire occurred, the affected citizens were given long-term construction funds without interest to rebuild the marketplaces and help them settle. The repayment method involved annual installments, and they were exempted from public service (公役) for that year to ease their burden. There were also special cases where royal grants (內下錢) were provided to cover construction costs.

To cite a few recent examples, when the established shops (立廛) were affected by a fire in the 5th year of King Sunjo (純祖) in April (1804 AD), 100 bundles (同) of timber (兵曺木) from the Ministry of War were provided to the established shops with a 10-year interest-free repayment period. 1,000 nyang (냥) of Ministry of Taxation reserve silver (戶曺逢授銀) were reduced, and the corvée (徭役) for that year was reduced. When the cotton cloth shops (綿紬廛) were affected by a fire in the 10th year of King Heonjong (憲宗) in December (1844 AD), 2,000 nyang (냥) from the Relief Administration (賑廳錢) and 10 bundles (同) each of timber from the Capital Garrison (禁營御營木) were provided to rebuild the marketplaces and help them settle. As in previous cases, the repayment was interest-free over 10 years, and the corvée for that year was removed. When the cotton yarn shops (綿子廛), paper shops (紙廛), and horse saddle shops (馬床廛) burned down in the 20th year of King Gojong (高宗) in November (1883 AD), the King greatly concerned about the fire in the marketplaces and, considering the difficulty of rebuilding, provided a royal grant (內下錢) of 10,000 nyang (냥) and 20 bundles (同) of timber from the Beneficence Office (惠廳木). On the 2nd day of the 9th month in the 24th year of the same king (1887 AD), the cloth shops (布廛), paper shops (紙廛), eastern bedding shops (東床廛), and cotton yarn shops (綿子廛) burned down. The intense flames at midnight turned the entire capital red, creating a scene reminiscent of a city that never sleeps, which is truly tragic to imagine. The King was greatly shocked and issued an edict to console the shopkeepers affected by the disaster and generously provide them with relief from the royal treasury (內帑). The edict was as follows:

The edict states: "Marketplaces are the source of livelihood for the common people in the capital. Now, due to this sudden disaster, the shops have mostly turned to ashes, which is alarming. With the cold season approaching, the loss of employment and homelessness are truly concerning. 100,000 nyang (냥) from the royal grant (內下錢) and 50 bundles (同) of timber from the Beneficence Office (惠廳木) are specially provided for assistance. Let the court properly allocate them, considering the intention of providing relief to the marketplaces."

As such, when disasters struck the marketplaces, the state provided support and relief, rebuilding the destroyed shops so that the affected shopkeepers could return to their businesses and maintain the mutual dependence between the people and the nation. Therefore, for the past 500 years, the Seoul marketplaces have not changed their business locations and have remained in their designated positions.

According to the "Complete Map of the Capital City and Rivers and Mountains of Korea (靑邱山河都城圖)" in my humble possession, the names of the marketplaces are recorded on both sides of the main road (대로) from Hyejeong Bridge (惠政橋) to Yeonjidong Bridge (蓮池洞橋), i.e., from Jongno (鍾路) 1-ga (丁目) (below Hyejeong Bridge) to Jongno 4-ga, and on both sides of the road south of Jongno 4-ga to Sogwangtong Bridge (小廣通橋), indicating their locations.
<72>

Here, I list them: On the south side of the main road from Hyejeong Bridge to Yeonjidong Bridge, from Hyejeong Bridge to the barrier (屛門) of the fresh fish shops (生鮮廛), there were umbrella shops (兩傘廛); from the barrier of the fresh fish shops to Jongno 4-ga, there were fresh fish shops (生鮮廛), pheasant and chicken shops (雉鷄廛), earthenware shops (沙器廛), tobacco pipe shops (煙竹廛), corner shops (隅廛), cotton cloth shops (綿紬廛), longevity bedding shops (壽進床廛), and white wood shops (白木廛); from Jongno 4-ga to Iron Goods Bridge (鐵物橋), there were birch bark shops (樺皮廛), blue cloth shops (靑布廛), grass hat shops (草笠廛), shoe shops (履廛), salt shops (鹽床廛), spoon and chopstick shops (匙箸廛), fortune-telling horse saddle shops (卜馬床廛), clothing shops (衣廛), and mixed grain shops (雜穀廛); from Iron Goods Bridge to the barrier of the hemp cloth shops (布廛), there were iron bed shops (鐵床廛); from the barrier of the hemp cloth shops to the entrance of Changdeok Palace, there were hemp cloth bed shops (布床廛) and long wood shops (長木廛); from the entrance of Changdeok Palace to the front of Jongmyo, there were grass goods shops (草物廛) and salt shops (鹽廛); from the front of Jongmyo to Li-hyeon (梨峴) (Baewoogae), there were lower rice shops (下米廛) and chick shops (鷄兒廛); from Li-hyeon to Yeonjidong Bridge, there were clear honey shops (淸蜜廛), fresh fish shops (生鮮廛), woodenware shops (木器廛), and straw shoe shops (繩鞋廛). On the north side, from the barrier of Sujinbang-dong (壽進坊洞) to Jongno 4-ga, there were rush mat shops (茵席廛), clear honey shops (淸蜜廛), upper rice shops (上米廛), raw silk shops (眞絲廛), ramie cloth shops (苧布廛), lookout gate bed shops (望門床廛), and established shops (立廛); from Jongno 4-ga to Iron Goods Bridge, there were established shops (立廛), distiller's grain shops (麯廛), black hat shops (黑笠廛), silver shops (銀房), fish shops (魚物廛), and mixed grain shops (雜穀廛). On the west side of the road from Jongno 4-ga to Sogwangtong Bridge, from Jongno 4-ga to Daegwangtong Bridge (大廣通橋), there were white wood shops (白木廛), paper shops (紙廛), and cotton yarn shops (綿子廛); from Daegwangtong Bridge to Sogwangtong Bridge, there were lacquerware shops (漆木器廛), monthly payment shops (月外廛), and Gurihyeon bed shops (九里峴床廛). On the east side, from Jongno 4-ga to Daegwangtong Bridge, there were eastern bedding shops (東床廛), cloth shops (布廛), paper shops (紙廛), cotton yarn shops (綿子廛), and horse saddle shops (馬床廛).

Comparing the positions marked on the map to the situation 36 years ago, i.e., during the Gapo Reform (甲午更張) in the 31st year of King Gojong (1894 AD), the birch bark shops (樺皮廛), which should have been next to the shoe shops (履廛), were above the blue cloth shops (靑布廛); the upper corner shops (上隅廛) were on the side of the fresh fish shops (生鮮廛); the iron goods shops (鐵物廛) were below Iron Goods Bridge; the excellent bedding shops (妙床廛) were below the long wood shops (長木廛); the lower shops (下廛) were missing on the side of the lower rice shops (下米廛); and there were one or two closed shops (廢廛), but otherwise, there were no differences.

1 Hyejeong Bridge (惠政橋) is popularly called "Pocheong Bridge (捕廳다리)." It is a bridge over the stream flowing along the east side of Gwanghwamun Post Office. When the road was renovated recently (completed in December 1926), the stone pillars of the railing were inscribed with "Bokcheong Bridge (福淸橋)."

2 The original name of Doneuimun Stone Bridge (敦義門 石橋) was "Gyeonggogyo (京庫橋)." Because it was popularly called "Gyeonggudari (경구다리)," it was corrupted to "Gyeonggugyo (京口橋)" and abbreviated to "Gyeonggyo (京橋)." It is a bridge over the stream that flows through the current Jukjeom Public Elementary School.

3 The entrance to a street or village is popularly called "byeongmun (屛門)." Before the Hwangtohyeon Plaza (黃土峴廣場) was established and before the road was renovated from Seodaemun-jeong (西大門町) 1-chome (丁目) to Jukjeom-jeong, the rectangular area where a straight line extending east from the north end of Seodaemun-jeong 1-chome intersected was the former Samgan-dong (三間洞). The entrance to the road from Hwangtohyeon toward Songgyo, which was about 2/5 narrower than the current road width of Seodaemun-jeong 1-chome, was called "Samganbyeongmun." Also, there was a "Samgan Stone Bridge (三間石橋)" at this road entrance. In the past, when the procession moved, the officers of the advance and rear guards would frequently report the movements of the royal palanquin (鑾輿) to the general. When the palanquin arrived here, they would slowly announce, "The royal carriage approaches Samgan Stone Bridge, turns left into Unjong Street (雲從街)."

4 The current court is located on the former site of the Uigeumbu (義禁府). Because it was popularly abbreviated as "Geumbu (禁府)," even now, the area in front of the court is called "Geumbu ap (禁府압)" and the back alley of the court is called "Geumbu dwi kkol (禁府뒤꼴)."

5 Ilyeongdae (日影臺) is the abbreviation for Hyeonjucheonpyeong Jeongnam Angbu Ilgu (懸珠天平定南仰釜日晷), a sundial. In the 20th year of King Sejong (世宗) of Joseon (1438 AD), two were made. One was placed near Hyejeong Bridge, and the other was placed on the roadside at the beginning of the south street of Jongmyo, i.e., the north side of Jongno 4-ga. Until the establishment of the electric railway in 1898, there was a stacked square stone platform about 4 cheok (尺) high where the Angbu Ilgu had been placed on the south street of Jongmyo. The Ilyeongdae mentioned in the text refers to this.

6 The eastern bridge is popularly called "Cheotdari (첫다리)" and Yeonjidong Bridge is called "Dudari (두다리)." They are written as "Cho-gyo (初橋)" and "I-gyo (二橋)" in Chinese characters, and I-gyo is also called "Jae-gyo (再橋)." This is because when entering from Dongdaemun, Dong Bridge comes first, and Yeonjidong Bridge comes second.

7 Jongnu (鐘樓) is the original name of Jongno. It is sometimes mistakenly called Jongnu (鐘漏).

8 Donghyeon (銅峴) is popularly called "Gurigae (구리개)" and is sometimes called "Gurihyeon (九里峴)." It is near the entrance of the current Hwanggeum-jeong (黃金町) 2-chome.

9 Nambyeolgung (南別宮) was the palace of the Lesser Princess (小公主) (Second daughter of King Taejong, Princess Gyeongjeong (慶貞公主)). It is the current Chosun Hotel.

10 Nae-ha-jeon (內下錢) is Nae-tang-geum (內帑金), the private property of the royal family.

11 Byeongjo-mok (兵曹木) is commonly called "Gunpo (軍布)," which refers to fabrics such as gipo (騎布) and bopo (步布) collected by the Ministry of War. Hence the name.

12 One dong (一同) is 50 pil (疋), so 100 dong is 5,000 pil.
<73>
13 Bongsu-eun (逢授銀) is also called Hangnyu-eun (恒留銀). The Ministry of Taxation sets aside a fixed amount of silver (銀) for the established shops (立廛) as the price for silks (匹段) needed for state purposes, allowing them to supply the silks. Accounting is done every three months, and any shortfall in the fixed amount is supplemented in two installments in July and October. Until the beginning of King Gojong's reign, 5,500 nyang (냥) of silver was set aside. At that time, the exchange rate for each nyang (兩) of silver was 3 nyang (兩) and 5 jeon (錢).

14 Jincheong (賑廳) is the abbreviation for Jinyultcheong (賑恤廳), a department within Seonhyecheong (宣惠廳), which was divided into nine offices (廳), one category (色), and one storehouse (庫) to manage the collection and disbursement of taxes. It was responsible for matters related to relief. The current Namdaemun Market and the fire station are located on the former site of Seonhyecheong.

15 Geumyeong (禁營) is the abbreviation for Geumwiyeong (禁衛營), and Oyeong (御營) is the abbreviation for Oyeongcheong (御營廳). The current Yi Wangjik Aakdae (李王職雅樂隊) is located on the former site of Geumwiyeong, and the Seoul Monopoly Branch in Inui-dong is located on the former site of Oyeongcheong.

16 Fires were often caused by the cotton yarn shops (綿子廛), and this was also the case this time. Therefore, during the reconstruction, the cotton yarn shops were moved to another location.

17 The map was completed in the first month of 1830 AD, 99 years ago.

18 The map also marks Yeonjidong Bridge and Dong Bridge with their popular names, "I-gyo (二橋)" and "Cho-gyo (初橋)."

19 Cheolmool Bridge (鐵物橋) is the popular name of Tongun Bridge (通雲橋).

20 Gurihyeon Bed Shops (九里峴床廛) are the same as Donghyeon Bed Shops (銅峴床廛). (To be continued) <74>

京城市廛의 變遷
						李重華
一, 市廛의 由來

左廟右社라든지 前朝後市라 함은 동양에서 國을 立하고 都를 設함의 일정한 準則이엿스며 시장은 人民의 貿遷이 此에 係할 뿐 안이라 국가의 需用이 또한 此에 資함으로 朝鮮은 遠히 三國時代부터 首都에 市廛을 置하야 坐賈를 安하게 하고 鄕村에 시장을 設하야 행상을 便하게 하얏는대 其物貨의 取引이 도시의 市廛은 日日로 此를 행하되 鄕村은 매월의 1, 6일과 2 ,7일과 3, 8일과 4 ,9일과 5, 10일에 市를 開하니 此가 소위 一月六場이다.
今에 市廛의 開倉을 考하면 高句麗와 百濟에 在하야는 此를 未聞하겟스나 新羅는 炤智王2년(서기490년)에 京師에 始히 市肆를 開하야써 사방의 物貨를 通하얏하니 此는 新羅가 당시 수도에 市廛을 置한 開創될 뿐 안이라 實노 後日의 開城과 京城市廛의 先驅가 된다 하겟다.
然한대 其後 智證王10년 春正月(서기509년)에 京都 東市를 置하고 東市典이라 하는 官署를 設하야 監2人 大舍2人 書生3人 史4人을 置하야 此를 관리하게 하고 孝昭王4년(서기695년)에 西南兩市를 置하며 東市의 例와 如히 西市典과 南市典을 設하고 監2人 大舍2人 書生3人 史4人을 各置하얏다.
此에 의하야 觀하면 智證王10년은 炤智王12년을 後하기 20년에 불과한 즉 炤智王이 市肆를 開創한 후로 市況의 발전이 速하야 尤히 此를 繁盛하게 하랴면 此를 정리할 필요가 有함으로 智證王은 당시 人民의 聚散이 편한 金城과 半月城을 중심으로 한 國都의 東部를 택하야 市廛을 此에 集合하고 官을 設하야 市廛을 보호 관리하게 함이라 하겟다.
新羅의 국력이 澎漲하야 竟히 百濟와 高句麗를 攻하야 統合의 業을 成하기는 正히 炤智王12년을 後하기 179년인 文武王8년(서기 668년)인대 隨하야 此時 新羅國都1 의 발전이 非常하얏슬 것인즉 東市의 一로는 인민에게 便宜를 與하지 못할 것이다. 故로 統合 後 27년에 當한 孝昭王4년에 西南兩市를 置함은 時勢에 適宜한 합리적 辨法이라 할지며 또한 新羅 國都의 발달은 東에 先하야 西와 南에 及함을 知할 수가 잇다.
高麗는 天授2년(서기918년) 太祖가 都를 松岳에 定하고 궁궐을 創하며 官衙를 設하며 坊里를 辨하야 五部에 分하야 도시의 규모를 정비할 時에 또한 市廛을 立하얏스며 其後 熙宗4년 秋7월(서기 1208년)에 大市左右의 長廊을 改營한 事가 有하얏는데 廣化門2으로 自하야 十字街에 至하기 凡1008楹이라 하니 此에 由하야 太祖 定都의 初의 市廛의 位置를 知할 수 잇스며<70>太祖2년을 距하기 291년인즉 大修繕을 要하기도 必然의 勢일 것이다.
且 新羅가 市廛을 置하야 市를 管理함과 如히 高麗는 京市署를 置하야 市廛을 句檢하는 事를 掌하게 하얏스며 別히 行廊3 都監4 을 置하야 市廛의 營造와 修繕을 掌하얏섯는대 熙宗이 大市長廊을 改營할 時에는 從來의 使와 副使 등 官外에 특히 宰樞(大臣格)로 別監을 任하얏슴을 觀하면 此時 改營의 工事가 중대한 것이엇슴을 知할 것이다. 然而 一時는 京市署 외에 大市司를 置하야 名稱과 如히 특별히 大市에 관한 事를 관리한 듯하다.

1 新羅 全盛時에는 京中이 17만8,936戶 1,360坊 55里엿섯다 함.
2 廣化門은 會慶殿·訖德殿·기타 諸殿의 址인 今의 滿月臺와 臺下一圓이 其의 範圍이엿든 延慶宮의 南門(或云東門)이니 略稱하야 兵橋라 하는 兵部橋가 此門의 東에 當하다 함.
3 行廊은 즉 長廊이니 國家의 設置에 係함으로 公廊 혹은 官廊이라도 稱함.
4 都監은 高麗時代에는 常設機關이 多하얏스나 朝鮮時代에 入하야는 國家에 大事役이나 大禮節이 有한 時마다 權設하는 臨時機關으로 변함.

二, 市廛의 設置

지금부터 538년 전에 朝鮮 太祖끠서 國을 開하고 즉위하신지 3년 즉 서기1394년에 都를 漢陽에 정하시고 太廟와 宮殿을 建하며 성벽을 築하야 新都의 건설이 次第로 進就하얏는대 市廛의 설치는 都를 정한지 제6년이오 太祖끠서 位를 禪하신 後에 在하얏다.
按하면 定宗원년 己卯 春2월(서기1399년)에 始히 市廛左右行廊 8백여 間을 置하얏는대 其 구역은 惠政橋1 로 自하야 昌德宮 洞口에 至하기까지의 大路兩側이며 外方의 游手와 僧徒를 聚하야 糧을 給하야 此를 役하게 하니 此가 京城市廛 최초의 시설이며 其後 74년을 經하야 成宗3년 壬辰(서기1472년)에 市廛의 구역은 협소하고 人은 衆하야 奸細가 攘奪하며 軍馬가 塡塞하야 人이 多히 躝傷하니 蓮地洞口로 自하야 敦義門2 石橋에 至하기까지 市肆를 分列하야 踈密을 得宜케 함이 可하다 하신 傳敎를 下하니 此는 즉 市廛의 증설한 구역을 동서로 연장케 함이다. 然하나 戶曺는 三間屛門3 으로 自하야 敦義門 石橋까지는 地勢가 窄狹하고 昌德宮과 宗廟와 義禁府4 는 人을 聚하야 雜鬧케 함이 不宜하니 日影臺5 로 自하야 蓮池洞橋6 에 至하기가지 左右에 分하야 列廛하야지이다 啓請함에 從하야 市廛의 제2차 확장은 原구역의 東으로만 연장하게 되얏섯다.
然한대 市廛을 설립한지 194년인 宣祖245년(서기1592년)에 壬辰板蕩의 亂을 經하얏고 又此를 後하기 28년인 光海11년(서기1619년) 3월에 鐘樓7 로 自하야 銅峴8 과 南別宮에 至하기까지 數千餘家가 延燒하야 人畜의 死者가 甚多한 참혹한 大火가 有하얏는대 餘孼이 未盡하얏든지 此禍를 經한지 19년인 仁祖14년(서기1637년) 丙子胡亂에 賊兵이 12월26일에 城內의 左右行廊과 公舍를 盡焚하얏나니 此는 市廛開創 이후의 空前絶後하얏든 大劫運이오 大厄會라 하겟다.
其後 97년간은 市廛의 災禍가 無하얏다. 然하나 英祖9년 10월(서기1733년)과 同13년 9월(서기1737년)과 同20년 9월(서기1744년)과 同37년 10월(서기1761년)<71>과 同47년 3월(서기1771)에 市廛이 火하얏다. 英祖는 其在位가 52년인대 朝鮮列祖列宗 중에 治世가 最히 長久하얏다. 然而 長久한 이만큼 市廛의 火가 頻繁하야 每10년간에 一度의 火가 有하얏든 比例가 되리라 하겟다.
원래 市廛의 설치가 국가의 경영이엿슬 뿐 안이라 大燒의 災가 有하면 피해 시민의게 무이자 장기의 건축 자금을 貸與하야 市廛을 改建하야 安接하게 하며 其辨償의 法은 年賦하야 상환하게 하며 當年의 公役을 면제하야 其力을 舒하게 함이 恒例이며 또는 內下錢10 을 賜하야 工費를 充用케 하는 特例도 有하얏다.
근대의 數例를 擧하면 純祖5년 4월(서기1804년)에 立廛이 回祿의 災를 被하매 命하야 兵曺木11 일백同12 을 立廛에 出給하되 10년을 限하야 무이자로 還納하게 하며 戶曺逢授銀13 천냥을 蕩減하며 當年의 徭役을 *減하얏스며 憲宗10년 12월(서기1844년)에 綿紬廛이 回祿의 災를 被한 時는 命하야 賑廳錢14 이천냥과 禁營御營木15 각10同을 出給하야 市廛을 開葺하야 安接하게 하얏는대 또한 前例와 如히 其辨償은 무이자로 10년에 排納하게 하며 當年의 徭役을 除去하고 高宗20년 11월(서기1883년)에 綿子廛 紙廛 馬床廛이 火하니 上이 市廛의 回祿을 극히 矜念하시고 改建에 其力이 雜함을 顧恤하사 특히 內下錢 일만냥과 惠廳木 20同을 助給하며 同24년 9월初2일(서기1887년)에 布廛 紙廛 東床廛 綿子廛16 이 火하얏는대 深夜의 맹렬한 화염은 滿都가 通紅하야 正히 不夜城을 作하얏든 광경은 思하면 實노 慘憺하다. 此時에 上이 大히 震驚하야 下敎하사 罹災의 廛民을 慰諭하며 內帑을 優發하야 挾恤하시니 其 敎文은 下와 如하얏다.

敎曰市井者는 都下民庶之資以爲生也어늘 今此鬱攸之災에 各廛이 多入於灰燼하니 惕然驚心이며 寒序將進에 失業棲遑이 實所矜念이라 內下錢十萬兩과 惠廳木五十同을 特爲助給하노니 自廟堂으로 量宜分劃하야 以市顧恤之意하여라.

斯와 如히 市廛에 災가 有한즉 국가는 此를 接濟하고 此를 救恤하야 燒失된 店肆를 復建하야 被災의 廛民으로 하야금 곳 舊와 如히 業에 安하야 民과 國이 相需의 道를 失하지 안이하얏슴으로 과거 500년간에 京城의 市廛은 營業의 處所를 變更함이 無하고 일정한 위치에 各在하얏섯다.
今에 鄙藏의 靑邱山河都城圖17 에 據하면 惠政橋로 自하야 蓮池洞橋18 에 至하기까지 대로의 양측 즉 鍾路1丁目(惠政橋以下의)으로 自하야 鍾路4丁目에 至하기까지와 鍾路4街의 이남으로 自하야 小廣通橋에 至하기까지의 도로 양측에 市廛의 名을 記入하야 其 위치를 표시하얏다.
此를 玆에 列記하면 惠政橋로 自하야 蓮池洞橋에 至하기까지 大路의 南側에 惠政橋로 自하야 샌전(生鮮廛) 屛門에 至하기까지에 兩傘廛 샌전屛門으로 自하야 鍾路4街에 至하기까지에 生鮮廛 雉鷄廛 沙器廛 煙竹廛 隅廛 綿紬廛 壽進床廛 白木廛 鍾路4街로 自하야 鐵物橋에13 至하기까지에 樺皮廛 靑布廛 草笠廛 履廛 鹽床廛 匙箸廛 卜馬床廛 衣廛 雜穀廛 鐵物橋로하야 布廛(뵈젼)屛門에 至하기까지에 鐵床廛 布廛屛門으로 自하야 昌德宮 洞口에 至하기까지에 布床廛 長木廛 昌德宮 洞口로 自하야 宗廟 前에 至하기까지에 草物廛 鹽廛 宗廟 前으로 自하야 梨峴(배우개)에 至하기까지에 下米廛 鷄兒廛 梨峴으로 自하야 蓮池洞橋에 至하기까지에 淸蜜廛 生鮮廛 木器廛 繩鞋廛 을 표기하얏고 其 北側은 壽進坊洞 屛門으로 自하야 鍾路4街에<72> 至하기까지에 茵席廛 淸蜜廛 上米廛 眞絲廛 苧布廛 望門床廛 立廛 鍾路4街로 自하야 鐵物橋에 至하기까지에 立廛 麯廛 黑笠廛 銀房 魚物廛 雜穀廛을 표기하고 鍾路4街로 自하야 小廣通橋에 至하기까지 道路의 西側에 鍾路4街로 自하야 大廣通橋에 至하기까지에 白木廛 紙廛 綿子廛 大廣通橋로 自하야 小廣通橋에 至하기까지에 漆木器廛 月外廛 九里峴床廛을 表記하고 其 東側은 鍾路4街로 自하야 大廣通橋에 至하기까지에 東床廛 布廛 紙廛 綿子廛 馬床廛을 表記하얏다.
斯와 如한 都城圖에 表記된 位置와 距今36년전 즉 高宗31년(서기1894년) 甲午更張時의 現狀에 對照하면 履廛의 次에 在할 樺皮廛이 靑布廛에 上에 在함과 生鮮廛側에 上隅廛이 鐵物橋下에 鐵物廛이 長木廛 下에 妙床廛이 下米廛側에 下廛이 漏落됨과 1,2의 廢廛된 것 외에는 差異가 無하다 하겟다.

1 惠政橋는 俗이 『捕廳다리』라 稱하니 光化門郵便局 東側을 沿流하는 開川에 架한 橋라 최근 道路改修할 時(大正15년 12월 竣工)에 欄干 石柱에 『福淸橋』라 刻함.
2 敦義門 石橋의 本名은 『京庫橋』인대 俗이 『경구다리』라 稱함에 因하야 轉訛하야 『京口橋』라 하며 簡稱하야 『京橋』하 하니 今의 竹添公立普通學校를 貫流하는 開川에 架한 橋.
3 俗이 路이나 洞의 入口를 屛門이라 하나니 今의 黃土峴廣場을 施設하기 전과 西大門町1丁目으로 自하야 竹添町에 至하기까지의 道路改修 전에는 西大門町1丁目 北側의 端을 東으로 延長하는 직선이 교차되는 直方形의 지역은 前日의 三間洞이엇스며 黃土峴으로서 松橋로 향하야 入하는 現의 西大門町1丁目의 路幅보담 약 5分2가 狹小한 도로의 입구를 『三間屛門』이라 稱하얏스며 又此  路口에 『三間石橋』가 有하얏슴으로 前日 擧動 時에 先廂과 後廂의 大將의게 執事가 行陣 中에 時時로 鑾輿의 行止를 報하되 鳳輦이 此에 到하면 『大駕詣三間石橋 左折入雲從街』라 緩緩呼唱하야 大將의게 報함.
4 今의 法院이 義禁府의 舊址니 俗이 『禁府』라 畧稱하얏슴으로 지금까지도 法院의 前을 『禁府압』 法院의 後洞을 『禁府뒤꼴』이라 呼稱함.
5 日影臺는 懸珠天平定南仰釜日晷의 簡稱이니 朝鮮 世宗20년(서기1438년)에 2件을 製하야 一은 惠政橋畔에 一은 宗廟 南街 즉 鍾路4丁目 北側의 初인 路傍에 各置하얏섯는대 宗廟 南街에는 光武2년 電氣鐵道敷設時까지 仰釜日晷를 置하얏든 略 4尺高의 疊置한 方形臺石이 有하얏나니 本文의 日影臺는 卽此라.
6 俗이 東橋를 『첫다리』 蓮池洞橋를 『두다리』라 하다. 漢字로 『初橋』 『二橋』라 書하며 二橋는 『再橋』라 又稱하나니 此는 東大門으로서 入하자면 東橋가 初有하고 蓮池洞橋가 第二로 有함에 因함.
7 鐘樓는 鍾路의 본명이니 鐘漏라 誤稱함도 有함.
8 銅峴은 俗이 『구리개』라 稱하야 『九里峴』라이 或稱하나니 今 黃金町2丁目 입구의 부근.
9 南別宮은 小公主(太宗 第二女 慶貞公主)宮이니 今 朝鮮호텔.
10 內下錢은 內帑金이니 王室의 私財.
11 兵曺木은 通稱하야 軍布하 하는 騎布와 步布인대 兵曺에서 收捧하는 木綿布인 故로 此稱이 有함.
12 一同은 50疋이니 100同은 5천疋.<73>
13 逢授銀은 恒留銀이라 亦稱하니 此는 戶曺가 國用에 要하는 匹段(비단)價로 定數의 銀을 立廛에 預히 留置하고 匹段을 進排하게 하며 每3朔에 會計하야 定數의 不足額은 7월과 10월의 兩等에 充給하나니 高宗初까자는 銀5,500냥을 유치하얏스며 당시 銀每兩重에 代錢은 3兩5錢.
14 賑廳은 賑恤廳의 簡稱이니 九廳一色一庫에 分하야 租稅의 出納을 掌하는 宣惠廳의 一廳으로 挾恤에 關한 事를 分掌하며 今의 南大門市場과 消防隊의 一圓이 宣惠廳의 舊址.
15 禁營은 禁衛營의, 御營은 御營廳의 簡稱이니 今의 李王職雅樂隊의 一圓이 禁衛營의 舊址오 仁義洞의 京城專賣支局이 御營廳의 舊址.
16 火災의 原因이 往往히 綿子廛에 有하얏고 此時에도 然하얏다하야 改建의 際에 綿子廛은 他處로 移轉하야 設置함.
17 圖는 距今 99년 전인 純祖30년 庚寅 正月에 成함.
18 圖에도 蓮池洞橋와 東橋를 俗稱인 二橋 初橋로 表記됨.
19 鐵物橋는 通雲橋의 俗稱.
20 九里峴床廛은 즉 銅峴床廛. (계속) <74>
