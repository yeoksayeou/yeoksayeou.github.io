The Literary and Military Accomplishments of Sim Uk-gok, the Hero of Tanchon
						Tanchon Sim Horan

Sim Uk-gok, the hero of Tanchon! Anyone in the Hamgyong region knows Sim Uk-gok. His given name was Yak-hŏ (若虛), his courtesy name was Sil-ji (實之), and Uk-gok (㓒谷) became his pen name because he served as the magistrate of Uk-gok County in Kyongsang Province. He was a descendant of the eldest grandson of Ji-baek (之伯), the Minister of Public Works. He first cried out in the land called Tanchon Jikjeol on the twelfth day of the second month of the Mujanyeon year of King Injo, thus falling to the earth. Although his lineage was undoubtedly prestigious among the local gentry at the time, a great flaw was that he had the misfortune of a poorly regarded great-grandfather. While his great-grandfather was no less worthy than any other’s, unfortunately, he was born as a son of a concubine, which not only rendered it impossible to wash away the stain on his own name, but also led to the removal of his descendants from the family register and their demotion to the local gentry. The so-called insults of being labeled a “son of a concubine” or “of a secondary lineage” were unbearable for any red-blooded man. In an era when such evil customs were rampant, was Sim Uk-gok the only one in this situation?

Sim Uk-gok was born into an eternally unfortunate family, and as a powerless son of a concubine, his future was greatly lamented as uncertain. From the time he barely learned to speak, his exceptional martial prowess and extraordinary intelligence amazed many. During the winter, he braved the bitter cold to attend the village school (書堂) and achieved excellent grades. During the summer, while working as a cowherd, he entered the deep valley of Unju Mountain (雲住山) and constantly practiced calligraphy with galpil (葛筆 – reed pen) and charcoal ash. He also composed poetry and mastered swordsmanship. Before long, his calligraphy and swordsmanship gained high acclaim. It is almost like a tall tale, but it is said that when he practiced calligraphy, the water in the Unju Mountain cave turned into ink when it rained.

At this time, the nation was repeatedly experiencing factional strife, scholar purges, debates over legitimacy, and oppression of the people centered on class power. The evil wind of power struggles among the local schools and communities, the so-called yangban (兩班) factions, was escalating even in distant Tanchon. However, Sim Uk-gok, having been demoted to the local gentry as a son of a concubine for so long, could not dare to seek official position and suffered various forms of abuse from others. The injustice in his heart was expressed only in short sighs and long laments to the heavens. Unable to suppress the rising fire within him, at the age of twenty-nine, with a heart full of energy, he bid farewell to his hometown of Tanchon and set out without a fixed destination, gazing at the uncertain road ahead, heading south towards Hanyang.

It was the Byeongjin year of King Sukjong when Sim Uk-gok passed the military examination (武科及第) with a single arrow, fully drawn. Advancing further, he served as the Hamhung Middle Army Commander, Daegu Camp Commander, Suseong Investigator, and Goryeong Vice-Commander. Whenever he attended gatherings of poets and writers, he would resonate with poignant prose, and whenever he entered places where gallant heroes gathered, he would express unrestrained boldness. Whether it was a morning when flowers fell or an evening when the moon was bright, whenever he appeared, his lively personality and extraordinary talent would outshine even the most vibrant colors, earning him not only the name "Hero of Tanchon" but also "Hero of Hanyang." Once, he boldly entered the Taegak Hall (太學館) fully armed. The scholars, wearing ceremonial hats and belts, were solemnly seated, discussing something. Who among them would welcome a warrior? Sim Uk-gok, feeling depressed and uncomfortable, wrote a quatrain on the spot and left: "Scholars, do not laugh at this body in iron armor, for I too have spent years throwing away my pen. This inch of fur remembers only the moon at midnight, and this foot of sword can clear the dust of the four seas." <141>

This foot of sword can clear the dust of the four seas.

On another occasion, one spring day, high-ranking yangban scholars held a banquet and poetry gathering at a mountain villa. Having heard of this, Sim Uk-gok visited uninvited and stood firmly at the end of the line. There seemed to be some kind of bet: "Whoever composes this poem first will have today's food and drink provided free of charge." They extracted the 'ban' (班) and 'chun' (春) characters from the title. Seizing the opportunity, Sim Uk-gok, with a dignified attitude, addressed the gathering, "I am an ignorant martial man who has only learned vernacular script (諺文) (as it was called then), so I dare to hope to compose even in vernacular script." The scholars, recognizing his character, all agreed. Before he finished speaking, Sim Uk-gok composed the poem, “Omol jomol, jol seonbi wolgeok deolgeok dul hoban ulgeut bulgeut okdanhwa yeogi jeogi nagyangchun” (오몰 조몰, 졸선비 월걱덜걱 둘호반 울긋불긋 옥단화 여긔저긔 락양춘). The scholars were astonished and ended up drinking all the food and drink. The scholars, having failed embarrassingly, could only praise him, "Truly a delightful and unparalleled hero."

At this time, Kim Seok-ju (金錫胃), the Minister of War, renowned for his awe-inspiring virtue, had an adopted daughter named Baek-ju (栢舟), whose virtue, wisdom, and beauty were, needless to say, absolutely outstanding. Minister Kim, wishing to find a suitable spouse for her, announced a notice in the capital with the topic "Baek-ju" and the rhyme based on the characters "ju" (舟), "du" (頭), and "hu" (侯): "The one who passes will be adopted as Baek-ju's son-in-law." Sim Uk-gok, breaking through the crowd of heroes and gallants, submitted his own writing. Whether it was a dream or reality, it was indeed accepted, and Sim Uk-gok married Baek-ju. How could the happiness overflowing from that joy be expressed in words? His poem was: "A small boat, that cypress boat floating on the midstream, how many years have you tightly hugged the blue wave's head? If someone asks who will cross first, it is the one who possesses both literary and military talents, the full myriad-household marquis (萬戶侯)." From then on, Sim Uk-gok received Minister Kim's favor and served as the magistrate of various counties, including Deokcheon, Jasan, Unsan, Anak, Seongcheon, Gasan, Munsan, and Bongsan, leaving behind a rich legacy of governance in each place. As a martial scholar, how could there not be those who were jealous of his excellent achievements? Alas, the life of a hero is full of turmoil!

In the court, factional strife and debates over legitimacy were severe. Prince Bokchang (福昌君) (Jeong (楨)), son of Grand Prince Inpyeong (麟坪大君), was implicated in a conspiracy with Chief State Councillor Heo Jeok (許積) and exiled. The hearts of the court officials and the people were troubled. When a request was made by Confucian scholars to execute Prince Bokchang, the court agreed to execute him. Sim Uk-gok was appointed as a propaganda officer and was ordered, "If you do not capture Prince Bokchang, you will be punished." Prince Bokchang was said to have been extraordinarily intelligent and brave. Faced with this predicament, Sim Uk-gok silently obeyed and prepared to capture Prince Bokchang. His beloved Baek-ju obtained a horse that was extremely thin and unsightly. Sim Uk-gok, wearing armor, rode the horse and set out at the head of the army to suppress the rebels. The horse was indeed a dragon horse (龍馬). It was an autumn night with falling leaves and a bright moon. Sim Uk-gok thought, "Ah! Our success lies in this night!" and as he advanced with martial prowess, the horse, as if understanding, exerted all its strength and flew into the rebel's camp like a fierce tiger, raising a dust-like sound. Sim Uk-gok then unleashed a frosty roar, and the ground seemed to sink as his frost-like long sword flashed in the moonlight. Prince Bokchang was captured and executed. For this achievement, Kim Seok-ju was made the head of the Bosa Dogam (保社都監), and along with Kim Mun-gok (金文谷) (Su-hang (壽恒)) and other important officials, he received a certificate as a first-class meritorious subject of Bosa. This was in the Sinyu year of King Sukjong, and Sim Uk-gok was thirty-four years old. <142>

Killing a White-Striped Tiger

While enjoying success, he also tasted the pain of jealousy, serving as a censor of the Office of the Inspector General and as a Councilor of the Jungchu Prefecture. Eventually, he became the magistrate of Uk-gok County, and the motivation was also difficult. There was a man-eating white tiger (咬人白虎) that had long caused extreme distress to the people of the county.

Thus, Sim Uk-gok, who was nicknamed after the county, began his term as magistrate. His first policy was to set traps to capture the man-eating white tiger, eliminating the great distress, and he distributed his monthly salary, along with old military equipment and over seven thousand cheok (尺) of gunpowder, to prepare for reconstruction. He also made every effort to provide relief to poor farmers. Hearing of these distinguished public services, the provincial governor, Yi Ya (李壄), reported to the court. King Sukjong greatly admired him and bestowed upon him a letter of commendation and a well-trained horse.

However, since Sim Uk-gok was born in the North, there was no longer any hope for him to advance further in his career. As he approached the age of sixty, he could no longer bear the growing longing for his hometown and resigned, returning to Tanchon. Upon his return, although some people outwardly welcomed him, inwardly, he was met with the cold treatment of being a "son of a concubine." Firstly, there was no hope of restoring his rightful place in the lineage from which he had been removed by the clan. Secondly, there was no opportunity to rejoin the local gentry from which he had been demoted, and he continued to suffer the same insults and contempt as before.

One day, he went to the Hyangcheong (鄕廳 - village hall), where the Jwaseu (座首 - head of the gathering) treated him with a condescending and disdainful manner. Sim Uk-gok, filled with indignation, mounted his horse in the Hyangcheong courtyard, raised his parasol, and drove his horse forward. The Hyangcheong gate, which was considered so high at the time, was low enough for Sim Uk-gok's parasol to reach. Sim Uk-gok stopped his horse and issued a frosty command, shattering the gate on the spot and opening the path ahead, then slowly drove his horse out. As things turned out this way, the flames of jealousy, obstruction, and the hiding and lengthening of shadows grew worse day by day. Sim Uk-gok, in this atmosphere, had no choice but to move his family and relocate to a place called Anbyeon.

Ignorant Tanchon! Savage Sim clan! How much pain did you cause Sim Uk-gok?!

From then on, Sim Uk-gok, regretfully repenting of past events, completely gave up on worldly ambitions and devoted himself to farming and reading with his children, leading a free life and a peaceful family. When he reached the age of sixty-nine (in the Byeongsin year of King Sukjong), on the fifteenth day of the third month, when azaleas bloomed and cuckoos sang, he departed once more on the path to eternity, choosing a final resting place in Gyeseo-ri (桂子里), Dangok-myeon (端谷面). Baek-ju and the trained horse lie side by side, silently spending ages and ages. What of the life of a hero?! Could this be called the ancient miracle and tale of Tanchon? <143>
