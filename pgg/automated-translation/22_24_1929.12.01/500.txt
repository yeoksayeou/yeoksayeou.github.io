Kyŏngsŏng Men and Women's General Participation in a Paper-Based Grand Year-End Party - Expulsion Order If You Don't Laugh
Organizer: Physiognomist

I. Membership Qualifications
Since this association is a single year-end party concentrating the total power of all men and women in Kyŏngsŏng, any Korean person in Kyŏngsŏng can participate. However, since we do not receive membership fees, the venue may become too complicated, so membership tickets are specifically distributed only to those with the following qualifications:

1. Graduates of the *Ssŏngssŏng* Laughing School (笑學校卒業生)
2. Those who reject all forms of funeral association-ism (一切忌會主義)
3. Those who comply with the Drunken Face Maintenance Law (醉顔維持法)
4. Those who have thoroughly researched the lifting of the ban on money and alcohol (金解禁及酒解禁問題)
5. Those who play entertainingly until the very last person and moment (最後一人一刻지자미잇게잘노는者)
However, those who have loved *Pyŏlgŏn'gon* (別乾坤) for more than one year are permitted to join regardless of qualifications.

II. Member Name Check
From now on, we will conduct a name check of the attending members. However, simply calling out names would be too dry and tasteless, and it would be difficult for many people to remember, so with all due respect, we will use the old-fashioned yet modern style of courtesan name checks from the *Ch'unhyang-ga*. One thing to understand here is that this gathering is solely for laughing and having fun, so when checking names, everyone must laugh and respond. If anyone shows anger or displeasure, it would be obstructing the peace of the season. Regrettably, according to the Liquor Constitution (酒■憲法), such individuals will be prohibited from attending such gatherings for one year, accompanied by three cups of liquor (酒■三盃). Please take note in advance. However, the names are in no particular order.

Now, let's begin. Since we're doing it in the style of the courtesan name checks from the *Ch'unhyang-ga*, we must first bring out a character from the *Ch'unhyang-ga*. Please only laugh when answering and do not get angry. Shh—it won't work if you get upset. The real name check begins.

III. One-Minute Speech
Now, it's time for one-minute speeches. The topic is free for personal choice, but it must be funny. Those listening, hold your belly button tightly, or your stomach may burst easily. Pay close attention.

◇ White Rice Cake Association President Yu Chin-t'ae Takes the Stage
Topic: In Praise of White Rice Cake.
I am a white rice cake tiger who eats white rice cake well.
In general, white rice cake is first, clean <102> and white in color, second, round, so it has completeness, and third, the corners are pointed, so eating it will bring many sons. Just listening to me, you can't help but swallow your saliva, right? Glug... glug...

◇ Bald-Headed Association Chairman
Hong Myŏng-hŭi Takes the Stage
Topic: The Proletariat and Baldness.
We, the proletariat, can only maintain a good life if our heads are all bald like mine. First, we can beg for other people's things well, second, it shines brightly, so there is no need to install electric lights, third, hair cutting fees are saved, and fourth, in the summer, flies are injured and die, so there is no need to buy insecticide. Just looking at these few things, how beneficial is baldness to the proletariat... shining this way, shining that way...

◇ Slim Body University Professor Yi Ki-yŏng Takes the Stage
Topic: Malinowski's View of Life.
Malino... Malino... Bbatjak Malino-ssi was born on the same day and month as me, almost thirty years ago. Speaking of his view of life, a loving body is useless, and only the bones must remain in order to do anything properly. Even if there is an enemy with a knife, he cannot even cut off a bit of flesh. His favorite food in life was dried pollock (乾明太). When the wind blew, he flew well without taking an airplane and traveled around the world. (Time Exceeded, Speech Stopped)

◇ Pockmarked Women's Alliance President
Son Chŏng-gyu Takes the Stage
Topic: Pockmark Beauty Techniques.
First, when applying powder, use a heavy powder first for a pore-filling application. Second, always wear mesh over the face. Third, pay attention to foods such as zucchini squash (가보자), square rice cake (가다방), beef tripe, and honeycomb. When walking, do not engage in petty fights…….

◇ Head of the Deaf Science ◇ Women's University
Kim Miri-sa Takes the Stage
Topic: This Noisy World…….
Ah—this world is truly noisy. It is fortunate to be like me, someone who does not hear well. Even if strong people fire cannons beside you, it will sound like farts, and even if ten thousand horses open their mouths and scream wildly, it will seem like yawning. Ah—ears…ears….

◇ Little People's Small Leader
Yu Ok-gyŏng Takes the Stage
Topic: Our Factions.
We, little people, have too many factions. The smallest among them is the so-called Hole Character Faction (穴字派), where feet are attached to the hat. Next is the Mouth Character Faction (具字派), where feet are attached to the eyes, and next is the Only Character Faction (只字派), where feet are attached to the mouth. Even in today's world, what good is being tall, but how can it be possible for people smaller than others to have so many factions? Somehow, we must eliminate these factions (Great applause of sympathy from members Ch'oe Sŏng-u, Park Chi-hwa, Park P'al-yang, Chin Chang-sŏp, Kwon Chin-gyu).

◇ Leader of the Left-Handed Food Party Hŏ Hŏn Takes the Stage
Topic: Left-Handed Eating and Work Efficiency.
Look! Hands! Hands… my hand! I am originally accustomed to eating with my left hand. If others also eat with their left hands like me, and do something with their right hands while eating, how much more work efficiency would be gained? Today, ordinary people only use their right hands, so naturally the efficiency of the left hand decreases, right? Everyone! Please applaud my words with your left hand.

◇ Joke Supervisor Kwon Tŏk-kyu Takes the Stage
Topic: Jokes and Socializing.
A joke is a joke, but a witty joke is a fresh joke. What is the necessity for jokes on a problem that has been repeated so many times? I thought it was a year-end party, but it turns out it is a senility party…….
(That's also a joke, lots of laughter)

◇ Multi-Bearded Party Member Myŏng Je-se Takes the Stage
Topic: Beards and Encouraging Products
Everyone! At a time like this when the economy is in a crisis, we must also encourage our bearded products well. During the winter like now, it's good because you don't need to buy a scarf in the first place, and it's good to have icicles hanging down, and if you keep them well and sell them as ice in the summer, you can get a considerable income. (Time Exceeded, Speech Stopped)

◇ Debukkung Children's Story Association President
Bang Chŏng-hwan Takes the Stage
Topic: The Story of General Debukkung.
Once upon a time, there was General Debukkung, who was even fatter than me. The general occupied the territory of others very well without any guns or swords. When fighting with enemy countries, he would climb to a high place and simply roll round and round toward the enemy lines. Then, all the enemy soldiers would be crushed and die. (Time Exceeded, Speech Stopped)

IV. Entertainment
While men went first for the speeches, this time women are going first for the entertainment. The subject can be anything according to one's strengths, whether it be singing or anything else. Now, let's begin. First, we will open with Han Shin-gwang's song "Until the Big Stones of Samgaksan Disappear and the Deep Waters of the Hangang Run Dry" (三角山의 큰돌이다업서지고 漢江水의 깁흔물이말으도록).

In the first act, Ch'oe Sŭng-hŭi's dance will be performed.
Ttang-ttaradang-ttang-ttaradang… (Her legs are a bit thick, but it's really amazing… Applause, request for encore).

In the second act, Hŏ Yŏng-suk, the wife of Ch'unwŏn Yi Kwang-su, will perform her hidden talent, the mortar pounding song (방아타령).
"Walking slowly and steadily, crossing the Paksŏk Pass, the red brick wall is my house in Sungsam-dong. The brief spring of peach and plum blossoms in the east garden is my lover, Ch'unwŏn... Ah, a child is crying, so I can't continue…."

In the third act, Chŏng Chong-myŏng will perform *Yangsan-do*.
"Eiei—even Tang Myŏng-hwang's Yang Kwi-bi (楊貴妃) is pockmarked like Mother (마마) (lots of laughter)

In the fourth act, U Bong-un (禹鳳雲), a Mexican noblewoman with a very dark complexion and jade ornaments on her face and a pierced left ear, will sing "Limit of Tears" (限의임) as a solo. Please don't cry too much as she is very sad. (She accidentally fell a month ago and injured her ear and face.)
"In this desolate world—on the fierce sea, love is only you, so let me taste complete life in your warm embrace"—
There are sounds of sobbing among the heartbroken women <104>—.

In the fifth act, Chŏng Ch'il-sŏng (丁七星) will perform a *kayagŭm* (伽倻琴) duet.
"Tung-tung-teng-teng-tungdadung-Let's go-let's go-Let's go quickly-Let's go to the destination quickly-Let's go with our comrades-Ji-tung-ji-tung-jitdung"—How wonderful and as good as ever-.

In the sixth act, Kim Chŏng-wŏn (金貞媛) will perform a farmer's play.
"Ah-ha-the topknot has fallen off, I can't do it-I'm going in-(The topknot was well-tied in the photo taken the other day, but why-failure-and commotion in the audience)

In the seventh act, Hwang Shin-dŏk's lullaby is a baby song.
"Lullaby, lullaby, go to sleep quickly, our Wŏn-bin (氏's child born this year) sleeps well. Jade Boy, Golden Girl, the most precious child in the world…."

Now, the men's entertainment will begin. Shinganhoe (新幹會) Kim Hong-jin (金弘鎭)'s *changgo* (장고 - Korean drum) will be followed by Dong-a Ilbo (東亞日報) Kuk Ki-yŏl (鞠琦烈)'s short song. Hanŭn (韓銀) Yi Hang-jong (李恒鍾)'s hunchback dance and Ch'ŏndogyohoe (天道敎會) Yi Tu-sŏng (李斗星)'s bear dance, and Yi Ryang's Russian airplane dance will be performed at the same time. (At this time, Hŏ Chŏng-suk's shoulder dance and Park Ho-jin's finger snapping rhythm were also interesting.) After that, Yi Byŏng-gi's (李秉岐) *shijo*, Yu To-sun's (劉道順) "Nyŏngbyŏn Song", Kim Hyŏng-wŏn's (金炯元) ballad and Kim Jin-gu's (金振九) exhilarating call-and-response song, and Paek Nam-gyu's (白南奎) arithmetic song (Hey, check your socks and sing, hahaha…hahaha…) will be performed all at once.

"Ari dongdong-shiri daengdaeng-holgwaeng no iririri songal songal-Arirang float, float the boat…." This is Chŏng Sun-chŏl (鄭順哲)'s Hwanghae-do Arirang ballad, with a beautiful and gentle voice. "The peak over there is covered in rain…" is Ch'oe Kyu-dong's (崔奎東) six-beat measure. Oh dear-the order is slightly wrong. The female vocalist Park Kyŏng-hŭi (朴敬姬) and the female journalist Kim Mal-bong (金末峯) of the Chung-oe Ilbo (中外日報), a master of eccentric songs, are missing. Please forgive me……. Now, since it is late and there is a dining time, let's end the entertainment and close the event with Kim Hwal-ran's (金活蘭) hymn. How were Son Chŏng-gyu's (孫貞奎) and Bang Shin-yŏng's (方信榮) recipes? Enjoy the paper-based cuisine and have a happy passing of the year. <105>
