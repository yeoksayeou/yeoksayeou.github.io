◇The Spirit of Mountain and Water

Mountains are high, and water is beautiful. Therefore, the country is called Koryŏ (高麗). Among the lands, Kwanseo (關西) region would be the most splendid place with mountains and water. Notable figures, blessed with the spirit of these mountains and waters, have emerged. Leaving aside ancient times, how about the heroes produced during the Koguryŏ (高句麗) era? What kind of figures stood out during the Koryŏ and Yi dynasties (李朝) eras? Loyal subjects, virtuous women, righteous men, and brave generals came in droves. Moreover, during the five hundred years of the Yi dynasty, many revolutionaries (革命兒) were born due to political shortcomings (政治的缺陷). The Kwanseo region is probably also famous for producing many rebellious children (脫線兒) and pranksters. Among Kwanseo, P’yŏngyang (平壤) is the best for its uniquely beautiful mountains, water, and local products (風物).

牡丹峰吐浮碧樓
大同江囚綾羅島

The artist's brush of the Creator suddenly thrusts up Moranbong (牡丹峰) on the Taedong Plain (大同平野), and beneath it, the Taedong River (大同江) adorns it with beautiful silk. This is the art of heaven. Ŭlmildae (乙密臺), Pubyŏkru (浮碧樓), and Yŏngmyŏngsa (永明寺), are nestled on ridges and mountain passes between green pines and willows, destroying the mystery of heaven and mediating the awakening of human insects. This is human mischief. Because the mountains and water are clear and transparent like crystal balls, how could the people born with the spirit of those mountains and waters be dull and foolish? They are born bright like mother-of-pearl ornaments and amber pendants, but among them, the Pong-i Kim Sŏndal (金鳳伊) I am about to introduce is the most talented person in the world and the greatest rogue whose wit has made even ghosts envious.

<128>◇Setting Fire to His Own House

His name is Pong-i (鳳伊), and Sŏndal (先達=武弁初仕) is his official title. He is commonly called Pong-i Kim Sŏndal, and his stories are so absurd and amusing that no one north of Kaesŏng (開城) doesn't know him. He lived in the outer fortress (外城) of P’yŏngyang, but after being imprisoned for some reason for several years and returning home, he found his wife and young children barely surviving through hardship, and the household situation was so dire that he felt dizzy. After much thought, he suddenly clapped his knees and came up with a great plan (一大妙案).

It was that night. In the middle of the night, when everything was quiet, a fire broke out in Kim Pong-i's house in the middle of the outer fortress. The flames soared into the sky, the smoke filled the air, and the small three-room thatched house (三間草家) was completely burned down in an instant. The neighbors, awakened from their sleep by the shouts, could only click their tongues, watching the house burn to ashes, and went back home. The drama (演劇) from the next day was interesting. Taking advantage of the rumor that Kim Pong-i's house had burned down the previous night, he visited all his friends who ate rice and money by the ton, appealing to them or threatening them. Because he traveled extensively between Seoul and the countryside, he had many friends, and those who associated with people from Seoul at that time were considered to have considerable influence in the countryside. Moreover, because he was a quirky prankster, no one dared to disregard him. So, with the money he collected, he built a tiled house and still had enough provisions (柴糧) to last for a year.

◇Stealing a Neighbor's Cow (牛)

<129> Then, with the remaining money, he returned to the world of entertainment (花柳界), spending money so lavishly that he came to the attention of the authorities (官家廉問), and police officers (捕校) began to follow him. Realizing this, Pong-i thought, "I'll have some fun with these guys." That night, he secretly led his neighbor's cow (農牛) into his yard and tied it up. The next day, the neighbor was in an uproar, saying that his cow was lost. He immediately reported it to the yŏngmun (營門), and the police officers rushed out and searched every house in the neighborhood, finding the cow in Kim Pong-i's yard. They arrested the thief from the house next door, rejoicing. When they questioned Pong-i, he only said irrelevant things. "This is my cow, why are you doing this?" he said. After much arguing and presenting evidence, they couldn't reach a conclusion, so they took him to the yŏngmun. Even the yŏngjang (營將) couldn't resolve the issue, and eventually, they summoned the magistrates (邑院任) of Yangdŏk (陽德), Maengsan (孟山), Chunghwa (中和), and Sunch’ŏn (順川) for a joint trial (會審). Pong-i's argument was so forceful that the magistrate of Sunch’ŏn eventually argued, "How could even a bold thief steal a cow from the house next door?" He concluded that the cow clearly belonged to Pong-i. Victorious in the trial, Pong-i proudly led the cow out, slapping the back of the angry neighbor with the cow's rope (■), saying,

"You bastard! If you lost your cow, you should have come to me for a trial. What would those magistrates know? Now, go find your cow!"

He let out a hearty laugh and returned the cow to its owner.

◇Throwing Excrement at Monks

There was a temple (寺), such as Yŏngmyŏngsa, that he visited every day. Whenever he visited, he only caused trouble, so the monks plotted to make Pong-i suffer. One day, they were making songp’yŏn (松편, rice cakes) at the temple, and they put excrement inside one of the cakes. They carefully steamed it, and that day, Pong-i came to the temple as usual. The monk said, "Sŏndal! You've come at the right time! We're having songp’yŏn at the temple today. Have some." He put the cake in front of him, and Pong-i carelessly grabbed several cakes. When the excrement-filled songp’yŏn burst in his mouth, the foul smell stung his nose. After suffering such humiliation, he stopped visiting the temple for several days.

He returned home and had his wife grind raw beans on a millstone. He ate only bean soup for several days, making his bowels so weak that just touching his stomach would cause diarrhea. Then, he slowly returned to the temple. The monks said,

"Sŏndal! It's been a while. Are you not well?"

"Yes! I had a boil (臀腫) on my butt and almost died..."

"Oh! That must have been painful! Are you feeling better now?"

"I'm a little better now, but not much..."

"What kind of medicine did you use?"

"My wife sucked it out with her mouth, and it got a little better..."

After talking back and forth, he suddenly writhed in pain, saying his butt hurt. The monks were flustered and didn't know what to do. "What should we do, Sŏndal?" they asked. He said, "I need to have my butt sucked to get better, but I have to go to my wife." The monks said, "Your house is nearby, why would you go?" They looked at each other, and because he was acting like he was about to die, they had no choice. "Then I, a humble monk, will suck your butt. Show it to me," one of the monks said. Then, Pong-i quickly pulled down his pants and, bending over at a ninety-degree angle, aimed his butt at the faces of the monks looking at him and shot out diarrhea like a waterfall. He contracted his anus and sprayed the diarrhea, so what happened to the faces of the monks? They were all wearing golden helmets.

◇"Agjagi" is the Baby Name of a Crane (鶴)

<130> He was famous for his wisdom, wit, and pranks, but Kim Pong-i and Hŏ Dari (許達伊) were also the best horse riders and archers in P’yŏngyang. Once, the P’yŏngyang yŏngmun held an archery contest (射擊大會) and promised to award a great prize (重賞) to the first-place winner (一等壯元). Pong-i thought, "If I use all my skills, I will surely win first place, but I feel sorry for Hŏ Dari if I win alone. But I am ashamed to be below him." So, he discussed it with Hŏ Dari, agreeing to shoot with the same score until the end, so they would both win first place. They pushed their way through the crowd of idlers and took the exam. Indeed, their scores were the same, so they were selected, then selected again, and selected a third time, but they continued to score the same. The officials became frustrated and decided to give an oral exam. The exam question was what the ten symbols of longevity (十長生=열가지오래사는것) were. Pong-i went in first and did well. Then, he told Hŏ Dari to name the ten symbols of longevity. Hŏ Dari named deer and turtle and other things, but he kept forgetting the crane (鶴). Pong-i told Hŏ:

"Look, you keep forgetting in front of me, so you probably won't be able to do it in front of the officials. I'll stand outside the door, and if you forget the crane, look at me. When I open my mouth and say 'hak-' (學, crane), you just say 'hak-.'"

He instructed him like this and sent him in. As expected, Hŏ named nine things, but he couldn't name the crane. Then, he remembered Pong-i and looked outside. Pong-i was opening his mouth and saying "hak," but he still didn't understand. Suddenly, he remembered Pong-i's "agjigari (악지가리, mouth's pucker, slang)," and shortening the word, he answered, "Agjagi." The examiner immediately wrote the character "no (不)" and declared him failed (落第) in the oral exam. Kim Pong-i, who was watching this scene from outside the door, ran in and said to the examiner,

<131> "Why is he failed?"

"Because he didn't know the crane and said 'agjagi'..."

"No, that's not right. He did know it. 'Hak' is the name for the adult crane; 'agjagi' is the baby crane. The adult and baby have different names. Let me try. Listen! The baby of a cow is a calf, the baby of a horse is a foal, the baby of a dog is a puppy, the baby of a pheasant is a chick, the baby of a chicken is a chick, isn't the baby of a crane an 'agjagi'?"

The examiner couldn't argue and had to give first place to both of them.

◇Selling Taedong River Water

To play lavishly and cheerfully, he did anything, using any means or method. He earned money by doing things that ordinary people could not understand, and his schemes (神機妙算) were so amazing that even ghosts were surprised. In the past and now, there are many cunning Seoul people (서울사람) who go to the countryside with thousands or tens of thousands of dollars, thinking they can eat up the locals. At that time, the guest houses (各려館) in P’yŏngyang were filled with Seoul aristocrats. Pong-i wanted to get some of their money but didn't know how.

Then, he came up with a plan to sell Taedong River water. One day, he made several hundred nyang (냥, currency unit) and put it in his pocket. He went to the Taedong Gate and gave a few p’un (푼, currency unit) to each of the water carriers going in and out, saying,

"Hey! Come to this gate tomorrow evening and wait. Every time you draw water and come in, throw me one p’un! I'll treat you later..."

He made a firm promise and that night, he went around to the guest houses, greeting all his Seoul friends. The Seoul friends, who were frustrated because they didn't know the local situation well, thought that Pong-i, with his outstanding appearance, luxurious clothes, and eloquent speech, was a powerful and trustworthy figure in the area. So, a wealthy Seoul man, who had brought tens of thousands of nyang to start a business, approached Kim Pong-i and asked him about the local situation, what kind of business to start, and what goods to buy and take back to Seoul. He even asked Pong-i to handle everything. That day, they went to a high-class courtesan house and had a good time. Then came the next day. The Seoul guest went sightseeing to P’yŏngyang's beautiful scenery with Pong-i's guidance. They went from P’ot’ong Gate (普通門) to Kija Mausoleum (箕子陵), then to Moranbong and down to Nŭngnado (綾羅島), meandering along the Ch’ŏngnyubyŏk (淸流壁) and viewing the old traces (the Imjin War) at Ryŏn’gwangjŏng (練光亭). When they arrived at Taedong Gate, there was only a mat laid out, but countless water carriers were drawing water and coming in, saying, "Sŏndal! You're here!" and bowing. They all threw a p’un. After sitting there for a while and watching, it seemed like he was making thousands of nyang a day, morning and evening. There couldn't be a more amazing way to make money in the world. Where else could there be such a treasure trove that brings thousands of nyang into your pocket every day with the ever-flowing river water (長江水)? It didn't require capital (資本), and it didn't require labor (勞力). He had never seen or heard of such a business. The wealthy Seoul guest, who had tens of thousands of nyang in capital = the Seoul gentleman who was only smart and wise in Seoul but became the biggest fool in the countryside, was so excited and pleased. After seeing all that, he pulled Pong-i into his guest house and pestered him, "Can I buy the rights to sell Taedong River water?" At first, Pong-i absolutely refused, but gradually his words became softer, and he began to compromise (讓步). After begging all night, he agreed to sell it for 100,000 nyang (十萬兩) at the time. The deal was made on the spot, the contract (文券=契約書) was exchanged, and the money was paid. Then, they parted ways. Pong-i Kim Sŏndal loaded the money into his house (運搬), and from that day on, he lived in luxury (錦衣玉食) and did everything he wanted. The foolish man who bought the Taedong River water for 100,000 nyang, thinking he had become a rich man now, was full of a sense of superiority (優越感) = the Seoul aristocrat who was only full of superiority. The next day, he went to the Taedong Gate at dawn and sat down, but even though countless water carriers were going in and out, forming a market, no one threw him a penny. He didn't know what was going on, so he grabbed a few people and told them that the rights had been transferred and that they should throw money at him. Everyone covered their mouths and laughed, saying,

"Hey! You crazy fool! Who's the owner of the flowing water that you're charging money? Hey, if you keep saying that, you won't even be able to gather your bones (뼉대이, euphemism for corpse), so pack up your belongings and run away!"

"Uh-oh!"

He was so dumbfounded that he only uttered those words and collapsed on the spot. This is a true story that is more like a lie, and the story of selling Taedong River water is still a famous anecdote to this day.

Besides this, there are many immoral (不道德) things he did, such as stealing money from peasants selling cows (牛) and tricking women into going to Myohyhangsan (妙香山) for sightseeing, but because our purpose is not to write about such things, we will only introduce the more interesting and amazing stories among his pranks here. (The End)

◇山水의 精靈
산은놉고 물은고읍다. 그러함으로 나라의일음을 고려(高麗)라고한다. 그려나라가운대도 산과물의 가장수려한곳으로는 어대보담도 관서(關西)디방이 그것일것이다. 이산과가이물의정령을바다서 두드러진 인물이 쏘다저낫다. 멀리상고(上古)시대는 그만두고라도 고구려(高句麗)시대의 영걸이배출(英傑輩出)한것은 어하엿스며 갓가이 고려와리조(李朝)시대에는 그어한인물이튀어낫던가! 충신 절부 의사 용장(忠臣烈婦義士勇將)이 떼를지어 나아왓다. 더구나 리조오백년동안에는 혁명아 (革命兒)가만히낫다 정치뎍질함(政治的缺陷)에라서…….탈선아(脫線兒)작란꾼만이나기로도 아마 관서디방이 유명할것이다. 관서중에도 산수와풍물(風物)이 긔묘절승하기로는 평양이 뎨일 첫손락을꼽을만하다.

조물주(造物主)의 그림붓은 대동평야(大同平野)에 별안간 웃둑 모란봉을 푹 솟쳐노코 그알에는 대동강의 비단물질로 곱고어엽부게 수(繡)를노앗다 이것은 한울님의 예술(藝術)이다. 푸른솔과 가는버들사이로 을밀대 부벽루 영명사(勝亭乙密臺浮碧樓永明寺)가 등마루턱 산골잭이에 떡버틔고서서 한울님의신비(神秘)를 트리고 인간충(人間虫)을 여오는매개를(媒介物)을 지어잇다 이것은사람의작난이다. 이러케 산과물이밝고 하게 수정알처럼 투명톄(透明體)로 생겨노은지라 그산그물의 정령을바더난사람으로 엇지 텀텀하고 미련퉁이로 날리가잇겟는냐 대모관자처럼 호박풍잠처럼 토틔게잘나지만은 그중에도 내가여긔 소＜128＞개하려는 봉이 김선달(金鳳伊)이야말로 텬하만고억만고에 재사(才士)중에도 상재사이며 지모(智謀)가 귀신 찜해먹게된 잡놈중에도 텬하대잡놈일것이다.
◇제집에불질러
그의일홈은 봉이(鳳伊), 선달(先達=武弁初仕) 그의벼슬이다. 세상에서는 봉이김선달이라고 흔이부르고 그의이약이는 엉뚱하고 우수어서 개성(開城)이북서는 모르는사람이업다 그가살기는 평양외성(外城)이엿는데 무슨일로잡혀서 몃햇동안 장방에갓치엇다가 노혀서 집이라고 도라와보니 마누라가어린자식들하고 그동안고생고생 목숨만니어왓스며 집안살림사리가 보는것듯는것이 도대톄신산한게 머리가뒤숭숭하다. 이생각 저생각 생각끄테 별안간무릅을탁치며 일대묘안(一大妙案)을터둑해냇다.
그날밤의일이다 밤중해서 사방은 적막하고 인적은고요한데 외성한복판 김봉이집에불이붓터서 화광은 한울을찌르고 연긔는자옥하며 뒷간만한 삼간초가(三間草家)는 순식간에 홀딱 불에타업서젓다. 고함소리에 단을여 어나와 모여드는 동리사람들은손도대볼새업시 살러업서진꼴을보고서 입맛만 쩍쩍다시고 그냥도라갓다. 그이튼날부터의 연극(演劇)이 자미스럽다. 간밤에 불이나서 김봉이집이 홀딱 살러저버리고말엇다는 소문이도는것을 긔화(奇貨)로 리용하야 돈량 쌀섬이나 노코먹는 친구의집을 모조리차저가서 사정도하고 혹은 을느기도하엿더니 워낙 서울로 시골로 출입이 널느기 때문에 아는친구도 만코 그때은서울출입에 교제가좀놉게만되면 그시골서는 상당이 세도를한다 그우에 그의사람돔이 워낙어긔뚱한작란꾼이니 저놈이 어한짓을할는지몰라서 누구나괄시하는사람은 하나도업다 그래서모은돈으로 기와집을덩그러케세워노코서도 아직도 일년은 지나갈만한 시량(柴糧)이되엿다.
◇이웃집소(牛)를도적해
그리고나서 남은돈으로 화류계(花柳界)로 도라단이며 엇지나돈을 흥청거려쓰는지 이것이관가의렴문(官家廉問)에 걸리어 그의뒤꽁문이에는 포교(捕校)들이붓터단인다. 그눈치를알은봉이는『에라! 이놈들을좀골려보겟다』고생각한 그날밤에 슬며시 그뒷집소(農牛)를 몰어다가 자긔집에다매어노앗다. 그이튼날 그집에서는 발근뒤집히어 소일헛다고야단이다. 일변 영문(營門)에고햇더니 포교들이쏘다저나와서 온동리집을 모조리 수색하다가바로압집 김봉이집에서 소를차저내서 도적놈은 압집에서 잡엇다고 조와라고 봉이를문초한즉 봉이는 어느개가짓느냐고 딴소리만 퉁퉁한다.『이게 내집소인데 왜이러느냐?』는것이다. 뭇고 밧고 증＜129＞거를대고대고해야 영영판단이되지못해서 그길로 영문으로잡혀갓다. 영장(營將)으로도 해결을못내고 급기야 양덕 맹산 중화 순천(陽德孟山中和順川)의 각읍원님들을 청병해서회심(會審)재판을하게되엿는데 봉이의 변론(辯論)이 엇지나 뻑세든지 결국은 순천원님이
『아무리 대담(大膽)한도적놈이기로 압뒷집에서 소도적질이야 할 수가잇느냐?』는 주장이 익이여서 그소는 봉이의소가 분명하다는 판결을나리고말엇다. 재판에 익이고나서 의긔양양하게 소를몰고 나오는 봉이는 지고서 노긔가등등한 뒷집소임자의등을 소곱비(■)로 탁치면서
『이간나위색기! 소를일엇스면 내게와서 재판을할것이지 그짓 원님들이 무엇을알리라고 거긔다 고하댓나? 인자 네소는 네가차저가라우!』
한번너털웃음을 통쾌하게 치고나서 소임자에게돌려보내엿다.
◇중놈에게똥사래

◇악작이는 鶴의 兒名
지혜스럽고 눙간지고 작난꾼으로도 유명하지만은 말잘타기 활잘쏘기로도 김봉이외 허달이(許達伊)가 평양성중에서 뎨일이엿다. 한번은 평양영문에서 활쏘는노름(射擊大會)을 열어노코 일등장원(一等壯元)에게는 중상(重賞)을 주기로하엿다. 봉이는 가만이생각해보니 내재조를다하면 반듯이 일등은 내게로오는것인데 나혼자일등을하기는 허달이에게미안한일이고 그러타고 남의미테들기는 창피한지라 생각다못하야 허달이와 상의한질과 언제지든지 똑가튼수로만 어내어 규뎡외에 일등을낭 두사람이쌍으로나게하자고 단단이상약하고 구름가티 모혀들은 모든한량속으로 헤치고드러가서 시험을밧는데 과연 두사람의수가 똑갓게되어 선발(選拔), 선발, 세 번선발을 해보앗스나 한질가티나아갓다 시관(試官)도 갑갑증이나서 견대다못하야 인제는 할수업시 구술(口術)시험을보기로하엿다. 시험문뎨는 십장생(十長生=열가지오래사는것)이무엇무엇이냐 하는것인대 봉이가 먼저드러가서 잘치루고나아와서는 허달이더러 십장생을처보라니 사슴이니 거북인 무엇무엇다치고나서 학(鶴)한가지는 아무리일러주어도 니자버린다 봉이는 허에게

◇대동강물을팔어먹어
호화롭게 쾌활하게놀기위해서는 어떤짓이든지 수단과방법을 가리지안는다. 보통사람의상식으로 판단할수업는긔상텬외(奇想天外) 의짓을해서 돈을버러드리는데 귀신도 놀랄만한신긔묘산(神機妙算) 이엿다. 녯날이나 지금이나 서울사람으로서 땅을사느니 금광(金鑛)을하느니 하면서 몃천 몃만의돈을가지고 시골사람을 송도리채 집어먹을밥으로만알고도리단이는 재알이 깍쟁이가 얼마든지잇다. 그때도 평양성안의 각려관에 드러잇는 서울서온 깍쟁이량반이 시글시글하엿다. 봉이는 그놈의돈을좀 먹어야하겟는데어한방법이업섯다.
그리다가 한를생각한것이 대동강물을팔어먹을계교이다. 하로는 돈을몃백량만드러 주머니에 집어넛코 대동문턱에가서서 물지게지고 드나드는 물ㅅ군들에게 한사람압헤몃푼식집어 돌려주면서
『너의들! 래일저녁에 이문턱에와서 안저일슬터이니 강물을기러지고 드러올때마다 내게다한푼식만 던지고가거라! 내죵에 한턱 쓸터이니……』
이러케 단단이 약속을짜노코서 그날밤으로 각려관으로 도리단이며 서울친구들을 모조리인사한다. 객디에와서 그곳물정도 아직잘알지못하야 갑갑하든차에 외모가 훨쩍걸걸하게잘나고 의복사치라든지 말잘하는것이라든지 어대로 보든지 그디방의 유력가(有力家)이며 신용가(信用家)로만보앗다. 그래서 어떤 서울부자한분이 무슨장사를 하나해보려고 손에 몃만량들고나려갓다가 김봉이를만난김에 밧작 달려들어 그디방형편이며 무슨장사를 무슨물건을 사가지고 올라가야하겟는가를 뭇기도하고 모든일을 위탁하겟다고지하면서 그날로 어느일류기생집에가서 술한턱을잘햇다. 그리고 그이튼날이다. 서울손님은봉이의안내로 평양의 금수강산을 구경나아갓다. 보통문(普通門)으로 긔자릉(箕子陵)으로해서 모란봉치다라서 릉라도(綾羅道)나려보며 청류벽(淸流壁)변두리로 구불구불나려서 련광뎡(練光亭)의 녯자최(임진왜란)를 구경후에 대도문턱당도하니 거적자리만 한입깔렷는데 몃천명인지 수도알＜132＞수업는 물지겟군이 강물을 기러서지고드러오다가『선달님! 나오게시요!』꿉벅 인사를하고는 깡그리 돈한푼씩집어던진다. 한참동안 가티안저서 그거동을 살펴보니 가만이안저서 하로수입되는돈만해도 아츰저녁합해서 몃천량될것가트다. 돈버리중에도 이런 굉장한 돈버리는세상에는 다시업슬것이다. 곤곤(滾滾)이 흘러나리는 장강수(長江水)를 가지고 매일 몃천량식 주머니속으로 기어드러오는 이런 화수분딴지가 어대잇겟는가? 밋천(資本)이드는것안이고 힘(勞力)이 들기를할ㅅ가 이런장사는 ent지도 보지도못하엿다. 돈! 자본금몃만량가진서울깍쟁이손님=서울서만 약고지혜스러웟지 시골갓다 노으면 바보중에도 상바보인 서울량반손님 회가동하고 비위가 벗적당기든지 그광경을 다본연후에 자긔려관으로 고드러가서 봉이를 잔뜩붓잡고서『대동강물파는권리를살수가업겟느냐?』고 작구만 성화를댄다 처음에는절대로불응을하다가 조곰식조곰식말이 부드러워지고 양보(讓步)를 하기시작을해서 밤새도록 졸러뗀것이 그때ㅅ돈으로 십만량(十萬兩)에 승낙이되고 제자리에서 문권(文券=契約書)지교환되고 돈지 치루웟다. 그리고나서 헤여젓다. 봉이김선달은 그돈을자긔집에다가 실어(運搬)다노코서 그날부터 금의옥식(錦衣玉食)에 가진호사를다하고 껏떡댄다. 대동강물을 십만량에 사노코서제가인제는 큰부자가되엇다고 득의양양해서하는 헛똑똑이=배ㅅ속에 우월감(優越感)만 갓득차서잇는 서울부자량반님, 그이튼날 첫새벽부터 대동강문턱에가서 자리를펴고 안자보앗스나 그수만은 물지개ㅅ군이 들낙날낙 장을일우면서도 돈한푼던지고 가는사람은 하나도 업사. 엇지된셈인지 알수가업서서 참다못하야몃사람을 붓잡고권리가 이동되엿단말을하며 내게로 돈을던지라니 그사람들모다서로 입을사고 도라서웃으면서
『여보! 이정신진친구야! 흘러가리는물을 누가임자라고 돈을밧는단말이요? 여보그위소리하다가는 당신의 뼉대이도 추려가지못할터이니 어서진작보리싸고 발치 돌려세우라우!』
『어-ㅇ!』
하도어이가업서서 이소리만한마듸치고 그 자리에 나잡바젓다. 이것은 정말로 거짓말가튼 참말이며 지금지도 대동강물팔어먹엇다는일화가 유명한이약이ㅅ거리가 되어잇다.
이밧게 촌사람의 소(牛)팔고가는돈을빼섯다든지 부인들을여서 묘향산구경갓다가 엇지엇지햇다든지 잡놈의일이라는것보담 부도덕(不道德)한 짓이 만치만은 그런것을쓰는것은 우리의본뜻이안이기 때문에 여긔는비교뎍 그의작란중에 자미잇고 신긔한이약이만 소개하기로한다. ()＜133＞
