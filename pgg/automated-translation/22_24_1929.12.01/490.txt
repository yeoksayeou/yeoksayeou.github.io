Two Jokes
Mistake of Mistakes
Master: "Hey, did you put those two letters in the mailbox?"
Servant: "Yes, I did. But I heard that the postage stamp was put on wrong. You put three *chon* (錢) on the one going abroad, and twenty *chon* on the one going to the city."

Master: "Huh! Is that so? Then what did you do?"
Servant: "Well, you don't have to worry about it. I fixed the mistake and sent it. Isn't it enough to just switch the addresses on the envelopes?"
Master: "……………"

Hope
Seeing her husband join life insurance,
Wife: "Honey! I want to join insurance too."
Husband: "It's no use for two people."
Wife: "Still, how much is it with just you alone?"
Husband: "Okay!"
Wife: "Then, when you get all that money, won't you make an ideal family outside the gate and live there?"
Husband: "Then join! Then it will be 10,000 *won* (圓)."
Wife: "Of course. And if you include the children who will be born, wouldn't it be 15,000 *won*?" <99>
