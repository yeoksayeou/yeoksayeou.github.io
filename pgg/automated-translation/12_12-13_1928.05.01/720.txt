Korean Women's Virtues that Surpass the Quiet and Virtuous World, True Stories of Representative Great Women in the Inner Quarters 2,3
						Palpan Tongin

My dear brother, I received your request to write something when the warm breeze of a sunny day was urging on the flower news, and already the hungry spring season, when red fades and green fattens, is approaching, and I haven't been able to complete the draft, so I've wasted about 40 days in the meantime, and I'm extremely uneasy about what to do. After becoming a wandering soul without a fixed occupation, my initial thought was that I would have time to take care of my chronic illness and that I would have time for meditation and reading, but my illness has worsened, and I often lie in bed groaning, and because mundane matters are even more chaotic, everything has been miscalculated and ended in fantasy.

Not concerned with worldly affairs, laughing and talking about fragrant flowers, there is still a promise for next year before the flowers.
Leaning on a high pillow in a mountain tower, I dream for a long time, after waking up, who in the country knows last night's madness.
Generally, the vast sea eventually flows, do not let the mind be empty and troubled.
The morning sun has already turned into the evening sun, how has heaven ever been busy for people?

As you know, Seokpa Daewongun, who single-handedly shook the Korean peninsula 50 years ago, was deposed from his 10-year regency and lying in his Yangju Jikdong (Godeunggol) Villa, casting the glaring look of a tiger burdened by a mountain towards the Hanyang political world, one of his nostalgic works is the 7-rhyme poem written above. There are many differences in terms of situation, character, circumstances, and thought, so we are not discussing him, but only in the point of feeling the restlessness of "empty self-torment" (空自惱) as a wandering heart, like a hangover headache, from one side that cannot overcome loneliness, the difference between him and us does not seem to be great. However, for the old man Seokpa, somehow he had a villa where he could lie down with a high pillow so that his spring dreams would be self-sufficient, and he also had a follower with a broad mind (whether genuine or not) who could abandon worldly affairs and laugh freely, so he sang "How Busy" (何曾忙) in the tone of an oriental philosopher who seemed to know his fate and be at ease, letting go of things outside of himself, while spewing out great flames to maintain his appearance, but for our wretched lives, even if we leave aside such leisurely self-enjoyment, we laugh bitterly at the fact that we have become figures of "empty self-torment" (空自忙) like the old man Seokpa, who seems envious. It is not to make a difficult excuse for the delayed manuscript, but if you understand the situation where things do not go as planned and the hand does not follow the will, I wonder if you will not be generous, so I am saying a few words of nonsense.

Enough of idle talk. This time, you asked me to write about something that would be "our pride," but no matter how much I think about it, I have a big question as to whether there is anything that we can call "ours" and show off to the world, either in the past or in the present. It goes without saying that the current 23 million people, who are second to none in the world in terms of poverty, and even if we search through half a millennium of history, there is not much to boast about. I am not simply "criticizing" or laughing at our things, but if we look directly at the facts as they are, observe them quietly, and criticize them objectively, no matter how regrettable it is, we have imitated everything from etiquette, music, criminal justice, writing, and clothing, calling ourselves "Little China" (小中華) and even denigrating our own original script as "amgeul" or "vernacular script" (諺文), haven't we? Still, until the so-called Three Kingdoms period of Silla, Baekje, and Goguryeo, the internal affairs were fairly well managed, and the external threats were defended, and there were some great plans and strategies to see, and outstanding great men and heroes did not cease, but ever since the Goryeo dynasty served the Song, Liao, Jin, and Yuan dynasties, and the Joseon dynasty served the Ming and Qing dynasties, with the etiquette of tributary states, they declined and decayed spiritually and materially, and it can be said that they lived like followers. For 6 or 700 years since then, due to the constant invasions from the north and south, the strength of the people was exhausted and the culture decayed, and internally, party strife was frequent, and they engaged in revenge through executions, and the rampant power of in-laws and powerful subjects and the jumping of corrupt officials and lowly servants, and while the stinking Confucian scholars were having grand discussions under the eaves, and the licentious cults and superstitions were spreading, the mountains and rivers withered and the people's livelihood was exhausted, and the great mansion collapsed in the midst of wind, frost, and decay. As a result, we need to reflect more earnestly on ourselves than boast to others, and from now on, we must make constant efforts to create more things to be proud of. The problem has gone slightly off track, but in any case, I will repeat that we need to solemnly realize that there is more "shame" than "pride" in Korea. However, even if there are few "things to be proud of," it is unlikely that a nation with thousands of years of history has nothing to show off at all, and one thing that can be specially written is the virtue of Korean women. The characteristic of Korean women can be summed up in one word: chastity, purity, seclusion, and cleanliness. The ancient Chinese poet admired the virtue of Queen Consort of Zhou Munwang, describing it with the four characters "quiet, secluded, chaste, and still" (幽閒貞靜). However, I do not know what the Queen Consort of Zhou Munwang was like, but although there may have been some "quiet, secluded, chaste, and still" women among the Chinese women after that, it cannot be said that they were all "quiet, secluded, chaste, and still" as a whole. Starting with the famous Empress Lü and Empress Wu, there are many outstanding women, such as Yang Guifei, Xiao Hou, and Xia Ji, who are talented and beautiful and have great wit, but when it comes to their virtue and conduct, there are many shameful acts that make people feel greatly ashamed. Even in recent times, it goes without saying that the misconduct of Empress Dowager Cixi is beyond words, and even Sun Yat-sen's widow, who was the founder of the Republic of China and a figure of the era, does not seem to have won good reviews for her conduct. Like this, the four-character virtue of quiet, secluded, chaste, and still (幽閒貞靜), which is not commonly used in China, can be generally applied to Korean women. Confucius, the master of self-cultivation, family governance, national administration, and peace under heaven, said "Women and petty men are hard to nurture" (女子와 小人은 不可近) while "expelling wives for three generations" (三代出妻), which shows how disappointed he was with women and how difficult it was to govern a family than to govern a country and bring peace to the world. Women have their own natural duties as women, and if not the only one, the first of those natural duties is to become a wise wife and a good mother, and to establish the merits of Yin assistance to make life truly good and beautiful, and the source of establishing those merits is also to be equipped with quiet, secluded, chaste, and still (幽閒貞靜) virtues and conduct. From this meaning and perspective, Korean women can truly be said to be women who are like women, that is, ideal women, and to have a large amount of the qualities of typical good mothers and wise wives, and this is definitely something to be proud of to others.

Following the progress of the times, the virtues of Korean women have changed both externally and internally, and especially in this transitional period, there are many women who have become depraved in various ways, and it is inevitable that licentious and flirtatious things that are the opposite of quiet, secluded, chaste, and still (幽閒貞靜) are in vogue, but even so, the blood of this virtue is likely to be much more submerged in the blood vessels of Korean women than in women of other countries. When I read the history of women in our country, I have associated the virtuous empresses, wise concubines, loving mothers, chaste wives, and virtuous women who illuminate the historical records and shine for thousands of years with plum blossoms that preempt the spring light and boast of their hidden fragrance in the midst of the cold wind and snow, and I feel reverence for them as if I were facing orchids and irises that are secluded and beautiful in the empty valley and preserve their fragrance alone. Moreover, when faced with the tragic catastrophe of heaven and earth overturning, the country collapsing, and the family perishing, and seeing records such as Nakhwaam during the Baekje period, the Jin Yang River during the Japanese Invasion of Korea in 1592, and Ganghwa Island during the Byeongja Horan, where even men with beards would be astonished, the traces of their tragic and sublime chastity make my knees kneel on their own. It cannot be denied that it is extremely difficult to find such things in the historical records of any country. Comparing Lady Choso’s serving of the bed mats of the Weilyeo and Empress Yang’s giving birth to children of Liu Cong, how great is the fiery action to exalt Korean women? It goes without saying that the virtues of the two rulers of the Silla Dynasty, Jindeok and Seondeok, are exemplary, and Yubi of Taejo of Goryeo and Empress Kang of Gojong of Joseon all became wise assistants to the great rulers and assisted in the great task of transforming the family into a nation, and Empress Jeonghui and Empress Inwon also demonstrated their power to solidify the foundation of the royal family by not moving their voices and colors and deciding on great plans when the country was in danger. In addition, Saimdang Shin's prenatal education resulted in Yulgok, who is called the Eastern Sage, and Yi Baek-sa, a meritorious subject of the Joseon Dynasty's revival, was also able to achieve what he did through the teachings of his mother, Lady Choi, and Mencius' mother's three moves for education (孟母三遷) cannot necessarily boast of this. The brilliant Kim Baek-ho had Heo Miseo as his grandson, and the literary virtue of the three Hong Yeon-cheon brothers was all received from their loving mother, Lady Seo. If I were to enumerate the talents of Nanseolheon and Okbong Yeosa, and the righteousness of Nongae and Gyewolhyang, I would never be able to write even a tenth of it on the limited paper. If I have the opportunity next time, I will try to compile a single book by collecting the Dongguk Cheolwon, even though I am poorly informed and my writing is clumsy, but on this occasion, I will briefly describe the noble conduct and wisdom of the three female figures that I have always respected and admired, and finish my responsibility and stop writing. (Drafted on April 24th)

Hye Gyeong Palace, Lady Hong (Posthumous Title: Queen Heongyeong of Jangjo)

Hye Gyeong Palace's (惠慶宮) family was from Pungsan, and she was the eldest daughter of Yeongpung Buwongun Hong Bong-han. From a young age, her virtue was high, and in the year of Eulmi (1745) during the reign of King Yeongjo, she was appointed as the Crown Princess (世子嬪), the legal consort of Crown Prince Sado. At that time, Crown Prince Sado was acting as regent for his father, listening to all affairs of state, but due to the framing of treacherous subjects, he was eventually deposed in the intercalary May of the year Imin during the 38th year of King Yeongjo's reign, resulting in a rare tragedy for all ages. Queen Hong, then 28 years old, took her one son (King Jeongjo) and two daughters and was imprisoned in a small house in the palace with extreme sorrow. Later, King Yeongjo regretted it and restored the Crown Prince's title, bestowed the posthumous title of Sado, and appointed King Jeongjo as the grandson to succeed Hyo Jang Seja (who was posthumously honored as Emperor Jinjong), but when King Yeongjo ascended to heaven, he ascended to the throne, but since he was formally adopted by his uncle, he could not posthumously honor his biological mother and only referred to her as Hye Gyeong Palace (惠慶宮) and kept her in his care. After the year of Im-o, the Queen endured grief and pain, not wanting to live, but she suppressed her sorrow only for the sake of Jeongjo, and on the one hand, the party strife was overwhelming, and the Queen's family was sacrificed and executed in succession, and all became ruined. After King Jeongjo ascended to heaven, the wicked men became even more rampant and slandered and oppressed the Queen, and unspeakable events occurred. However, the Queen lived through 60 years of adversity without a single complaint, only following the dictates of fate, praying for the repose of the late Crown Prince and the late King, and deeply warning her relatives not to desire positions of power, and described her emotions with the blood and tears of her life in the "Memoirs of Lady Hyegyeong" (閒中漫錄), which makes readers shed tears for every word. There are many consorts of the Joseon Dynasty who possessed the utmost virtue and conduct, but she went through vicissitudes of life, and her chastity, gentleness, and caution were worthy of being a model for hundreds of generations. She was the best in practicing filial piety, wifely duties, and motherhood. Heaven helps good people, and the Queen enjoyed a long life, and in the year of Gihae of King Gojong, she was posthumously honored as Empress with her husband.

Sister of Heo Jeongseung

Heo Jong (許琮) was from Yangcheon, and he passed the literary examination during the reign of King Sejo, quelled the rebellion of Yi Si-ae, served four kings, and was a great man who achieved great feats as a general and a minister. When he was appointed as the Right State Councillor (右議政) during the reign of King Seongjong and was in the State Council, King Seongjong's concubine, Lady Yun (the birth mother of Prince Yeonsan), lost favor and was deposed, and then slander arose again, and a command to bestow death was about to be issued. King Seongjong summoned the veteran ministers to the palace for a meeting, and Jong was also summoned as the current prime minister, so he went to the palace. Jong's sister lived nearby, and she was intelligent and wise and was skilled at judging people and matters, so Jong always treated her as an elder brother and always consulted her on important military and state affairs and received her instructions, so on this day, before participating in the court gathering, he visited his sister and consulted with her. The sister replied slowly, "Even though the heavenly authority is great and subjects cannot dare to speak out frankly, it is like an old servant of a private house who cannot disobey the master's order and kill the mistress. Not only is it unjust to do so, but when the mistress's son ascends to the throne in the future, how can those who participated in that act escape the calamity of being beheaded? If you want to avoid a great disaster for your family, there must be a way to handle it well." Jong was greatly awakened and left his house in Sajik-dong and fell off a bridge on his way to court, was injured, and did not participate in the meeting. Later, King Seongjong ascended to heaven and Yeonsan ascended the throne to avenge his mother, and he killed all the ministers who had participated in the deliberation at that time and subjected the dead to the extreme punishment of dismembering the corpse and exterminated their brothers, nephews, and nieces, but Jong alone escaped the disaster, and his younger brother, Chim, also rose to the position of prime minister and enjoyed wealth and honor, and all of that was due to his sister's instructions. Now, there is the Jongchim Bridge (now called Jong Bridge) in Sajik-dong, which was named after Heo Jong's fall from the carriage that day.

Wife of Yi Gichuk

Yi Gichuk (李起築) was a meritorious subject of the coup during the reign of King Injo, appointed to the 3rd class of meritorious subjects of Jingseosa, and served as the mayor of Hanseongbu. Gichuk was an orphan from an early age, not knowing who his parents were, not even knowing his surname, and was only called Gichuk because he was born in the year of Gichuk, and he wandered around begging, eventually becoming a servant in the house of a clerk in Gongju, engaged in cooking, and was looked down upon as a great man who was strong and honest but illiterate. The clerk had a daughter who was of marriageable age, and she was very beautiful and intelligent and could read, so her parents loved her and tried to choose a good son-in-law to marry her off, but the daughter refused to the death, saying that she had already decided on her spouse and would not marry another, so her parents asked who it was, and she replied that it was Gichuk, so her parents were angry and repeatedly scolded her, but the daughter's will was firm, so they had no choice but to make him their son-in-law, but they said that it would be a disgrace to their family if they kept him nearby, so they ordered him to move far away. The daughter did not want to live in Gongju either, so she asked her father for some money and moved to Gyeongseong with Gichuk, rented a house in Pyeong-dong, and made a living by selling alcohol, and at that time, Gwanghae was losing the throne, imprisoning his mother and killing his brothers, and treasonous plots were frequent and politics were in disarray. One day, the daughter called Gichuk and gave him a volume of Tonggam (通鑑) and a table of snacks and alcohol, saying, "If you take this to a certain pine forest outside Changui Gate, there will be about 10 famous scholars meeting, so first offer them the snacks and alcohol, and after they have finished drinking, open the marked place in the book and ask to learn from it. Then, invite the famous scholars to our house," so Gichuk followed her words and went to the indicated place, and indeed there were about 10 Confucian scholars sitting in a circle on the ground, engaged in some secret discussion, and they were surprised to see Gichuk, but Gichuk entered and offered them the snacks and alcohol and asked to study with them, so the people were even more surprised and confused, and those people were Kim Ja-jeom, Yi Si-baek, Choe Myeong-gil, Sim Gi-won, and others, and the place that Gichuk opened was a passage in the fourth volume of Tonggam where Huo Guang deposed the King of Changyi. When the people asked Gichuk the reason, Gichuk told them that it was his wife's doing and welcomed them to his house, and the daughter came out and said, "I know what you are doing. How can there be a country without a mother in the world? Your plan will be assisted by gods and men, so success is assured. However, it is easy to attract attention if you gather outside, and if you discuss important matters as pale-faced scholars, the help of military force is most necessary, so not only is my house located in a remote place, but the taste of the alcohol is not bad, so if you pretend to drink alcohol, the censors will not be able to detect it. Although my husband is illiterate, he has extraordinary courage and is honest by nature, so he can be entrusted with great matters, so do not forget him on the day of success." The people were surprised and pleased and followed her words, and the daughter's plan was so accurate that it was successful in every step. From this time on, Gichuk frequented Injo's private residence and received favor, and on the day of the uprising, he smashed Changui Gate and drove his troops straight in, achieving the coup. When they gathered in the court to determine the merits and rewards, the topic of "rewarding the alcohol mother of Pyeong-dong first" came up, and Gichuk was appointed as a meritorious subject and granted the title of Lord, and the woman was especially granted the title of Lady Jeonggyeong, and King Injo bestowed the surname Yi and called him Gichuk, taking the homophone of Gichuk. (Note: Regarding Yi Gichuk's achievements, the official history denies such things, but it is left as it is according to Yadam.)

Lady Na, Wife of Kim Mungok

Kim Su-heung's (金壽恒) pen name was Mungok (文谷), he was the grandson of Cheongeum Kim Sang-heon (金尙憲), and he was a famous minister of the Hyohyeon and Sukjong dynasties. His wife, Lady Na (羅氏), was the granddaughter of Oupo Na Man-gap (羅萬甲), and she was very virtuous and contributed greatly to Mungok's internal affairs, and she had six sons: the eldest was Chang-jip, the second was Chang-hyeop, Chang-heup, Chang-eop, Chang-jip, and Chang-rip, all of whom were loyal, scholarly, and had literary talent, and they became famous people of the world. The lady had insight and was skilled at judging people, and when her second son, Nongeam (農岩), passed the yin examination (蔭科) at an early age and entered the court in his new uniform, the lady frowned in displeasure, saying that his appearance was like a hermit in the mountains, and after that, when her eldest son, Mongwa (夢窩), passed the yin examination late in life and entered the court, she stroked his back and was very happy, saying, "A true great minister has reappeared in our family," and indeed, Nongeam retired early and did not serve, while Mongwa lived a long and high life and rose to the position of chief minister and died in the line of duty as one of the four great ministers of the Noron faction. Also, the lady managed the household strictly and was frugal, and although the family was very prominent as the granddaughter-in-law of a state councillor, the wife of a state councillor, the mother of a state councillor, and the sister-in-law of a state councillor, she lived her whole life like a housewife of a poor scholar's family, wearing hemp skirts and thorn hairpins, and did not wear silk. When there was a celebration at a certain princess's house and all the noble guests from inside and outside gathered, the lady also went to participate, and the princess was very respectful in her etiquette, and at that time, all the noble ladies were dressed in silk and jewels, and when they saw the lady, they wondered who the old woman was that the host was so respectful to, and later, when they found out that it was Lady Mungok, they were ashamed of themselves. The lady also had a beloved daughter, and when she was choosing a son-in-law, she had her third son, Samyeon, choose from among the sons of the Min family, and Samyeon went and returned, saying that there was no one in the Min family who was suitable, and he decided to marry into the Yi family. On the day of the wedding, when she saw the new groom, the lady scolded Samyeon, saying, "Although the appearance of the Yi groom is beautiful, he is not a man of great potential, and his lifespan is not enough, so why is your discernment so inaccurate?" She kept sighing in disappointment. Later, a group of cousins from the Min family came to visit, and Samyeon entered and said, "My mother always regrets not being able to marry into the Min family, so now that the Min family boys have gathered, please take a look at them." The lady saw them once through the crack in the door and scolded Samyeon again, saying, "All the Mins are destined to prosper, but you missed them, so you are truly blind." Indeed, Yi died before the age of 30 without obtaining a single office, and the Min family's brothers, such as Ji-jae and Dan-am, produced famous public figures and great officials, and Samyeon revered his mother's divine judgment in his later years.

幽閒貞靜世界에 冠絶할 朝鮮의 女行婦德, 代表的 閨閤 偉人의 實話 2,3
						八判洞人

不關俗事笑談香 花前猶有明年約
高枕山樓我夢長 醒後邦知昨夜狂
大抵蒼海終流水 莫使心神空自惱
己矣朝暉易夕陽 何曾天意向人忙
아시는 바와 가티 50년 전에 朝鮮天地를 隻手로 掀動하든 石坡 大院君이 10년 攝政의 地位로부터 제 1차 失脚하고 楊州 直洞(고든골) 山莊에 누어서 老虎負嵎의 睥睨를 漢城政界에 흘녀 보내면서 述懷作의 하나인 것이 右記 7律이라 함니다. 處地와 人品과 境遇와 思想 등 허다한 점에서 判異한 것이 만흔 우리로서는 그와 此論하는 것이 아니로되 獨히 浪人된 心事로 마티 宿醉 깨인 사람의 군머리 압흐듯이 孤寂을 놋기는 一邊으로 이러고는 견딀 수 업다는 『空自惱』의 焦燥를 깨닷는 점에서만은 彼我의 差가 별로히 업슬 듯합니다. 그러나 저 石坡老人으로서는 엇지햇든지 이곳 저곳에 春夢이 自足하도록 高枕벼고 누어 잇슬 山莊도 잇섯고 俗事를 抛置하고 笑談이 淋漓할 曠達한 襟抱(眞僞는 모르나)를 가진 收養도 잇슴으로 이와가티 知命安心하야 物外에 放狂하는 듯한 東洋流哲學者의 口吻으로 『何曾忙』을 노래하면서 大怪熖을 吐하야 體面維持를 하얏지만은 우리 가티 齷齪한 人生은 이와가튼 悠悠自適은 姑捨할지라도 石坡老의 비운 듯 『空自忙』＜158＞의 人物이 도리혀 健羨하게 된 것을 스사로 苦笑하야 마지 안습니다. 원고 느저진 辨明을 支難하게 하는 것이 안이라 마음대로 일이 되지 안코 뜻대로 손이 따르지 못하는 境地를 諒察하시면 厚恕하실 것이 업지도 안을가 하야 두어마듸 군소리를 드리게 된 것입니다.

閑話休題 今回의 課題하신 것은 『우리의 자랑』될 만한 것을 써 보라 하신 것인데 나는 아무리 百考千量해 보아도 우리에게 『내 것』이라고 내세우고 世間에 과시함즉한 것이 과거에나 현재에 과연 똑똑한 것이 잇는가부터 큰 의문이 됨니다. 현재의 貧窮하기로 세계에 둘재가기도 어려운 2,300萬은 더 말할 것도 업거니와 半萬年이나 되는 역사를 뒤저거려도 이럿타하고 떠들 것은 만치 못합니다. 나는 空然히 우리의 것을 『흉』보거나 비웃는 것이 아니로되 사실을 사실대로 直視하고 靜觀하야 객관적으로 비판하자면 아무리 遺憾은 유감이로되 禮樂 刑政, 文字 衣服을 모조리 남의 흉내를 내면서 『小中華』라고 自處하고 제 나라의 獨創된 文字까지 『암글』이니 諺文이니 하야 賤視하지 안엇슴니까. 그래도 羅, 濟, 麗의 소위 三國時代까지는 제법 內治도 잘해가고 外患도 防禦하면서 雄圖遠略의 볼만한 것이 업지도 안코 偉人傑士의 특출한 이가 끈이지 안터니 一自 麗朝가 宋, 遼, 金, 元에게, 李朝가 明, 淸에게 藩國의 禮로써 服事함으로부터 靈的으로 物的으로 一層 墮落 零衰하야 可謂 따라지 목숨으로 지내엿습니다. 伊來 6, 700년에 外로는 南北의 侵寇로 兵火가 끈이지 아니하야 民力이 湯殘하고 文化가 衰盡하얏스며 內으로 黨禍가 頻仍하야 誅戮으로 報復을 일삼으며 外戚權臣의 跋扈와 貪官汚吏의 跳梁이며 고린내 나는 儒林의 屋下大談 淫祀와 迷信의 瀰蔓 그리는 동안에 山河는 枯禿하고 民生은 困瘁하야 風霜震剝하는 가운대 巨廈가 기우러지고 마럿습니다. 그리고 보니 우리는 남에게 誇示할 것보다도 좀 더 切實하게 內省하야 가며 지금부터는 더욱 자랑거리를 만들도록 부단의 노력을 가저야 하겟습니다. 문제가 잠싊� 脫線되엿습니다만은 여하튼 朝鮮에서는『자랑』보다는『북그럼』이 더 만흔 것은 우리가 엄숙하게 自覺할 필요가 잇다는 것을 거듭 말하랴 합니다. 그러나 아무리 『자랑거리』가 적다고는 할지라도 수천년 역사를 가진 민족에게 무엇이든지 全然히 과시할 거리가 업슬 리도 업기니와 그 중에 한가지 特筆大書하야도 無妨한 것은 朝鮮女子의 德操가 그것이라 하겟습니다. 朝鮮女子의 특질은 一言으로 蔽하면 貞純幽潔한 것이외다. 古昔의 支那 詩人은 周文王의 后妃의 德性을 嘆美하야 『幽閒貞靜』의 네글자로 形容하얏습니다. 그러나 周文王의 后妃는 엇더하얏는지 알 수 업스되 伊後의 支那婦人들은 간혹『幽閒貞靜』한 이도 잇섯슬 터이지만은 전체로 보아『幽閒貞靜』하다고는 할 수 업습니다. 저 유명한 呂后 武后로 비롯하야 楊太眞이니 蕭厚 夏姬이니 누구누구 할 것 업시 才色雙絶하고 機智縱橫한 女傑이 만치만은 그 德性과 操行에 니르러서는 醜穢한 行蹟이＜159＞ 사람으로 大慚케 하는 것이 만히 잇습니다. 근일에 와서도 西太后의 亂行은 더 말할 것도 업고 民國革命의 元祖로 一代의 風雲兒 이든 孫中山의 未亡人까지가 操行上으로는 好評을 博치 못하는 모양이외다. 이와가티 支那에서는 통용되지 못하는 幽閒貞靜의 四字婦德이 朝鮮女子에게는 일반으로 적용할 수가 잇습니다. 修齊治平之道의 宗師이든 孔子님이 『三代出妻』를 하면서『女子와 小人은 不可近』이라고 歎息한 것을 보면 얼마나 여성에게 실망하여 齊家하기가 治國平天下보다도 어렵든 것을 窺知할 수가 잇습니다. 女性은 여성으로서의 天職이 잇스며 그 천직 중의 唯一이 아니라하면 제1 될 것은 賢妻가 되며 良母가 되어 인생을 眞善眞美化하도록 陰 助의 功德을 세우는 데 잇슬 것이며 그 공덕을 세우는 源泉은 또한 幽閒貞靜한 德性과 操行을 가추어야 하겟습니다. 이러한 의미와 견지에서 朝鮮 女子는 실로 女子다운 여자 즉 理想的 여성이며 典型的 양모 현모의 소질을 다량으로 가젓다 할 것이오 이러한 것은 남에게 확실히 자랑함 즉도 합니다.

時代의 進運을 따러서 朝鮮 婦人의 德操도 外觀으로 內容으로 변화된 것도 만코 더욱 최근과 가튼 過渡期에 잇서서는 여러 가지로 墮落된 여성도 만코 幽閒貞靜과의 正反對되는 放縱 妖恣한 것이 유행하는 것도 면치 못할 일이지만은 그래도 朝鮮 女子의 혈관에는 다른 나라의 婦人보담 이 德操의 피가 만히 잠겨 잇슬 것이외다. 나는 우리나라의 閨閤史를 읽을 때에 賢后, 哲妃, 慈母, 貞婦, 淑媛이 史冊을 炳烺하며 千秋에 照耀하는 것이 맛치 北風寒雪 중에 春光을 先占하야 暗香을 自誇하는 梅花도 聯想하얏스며 空谷에 幽秀하야 馨芳을 獨保하는 蘭蕙를 대함과 가티 欽敬을 自生케 합니다. 더욱이 天翻地覆하고 國破 家亡하는 劫運悲劇을 만나서 有髥의 男子로 瞠若케할 만한 예컨대 百濟때의 落花岩, 壬亂의 晋陽江, 丙亂의  沁都 등 기록을 보면 그 凄切壯絶한 貞烈의 자최가 雙膝이 自跪케 됨니다. 이런 것은 어늬 나라 史記에서든지 어더 보기 極難한 일이라 云치 안을 수 업습니다. 楚昭의 夫人의 闈閭의 枕席을 뫼시고 羊后가 劉聰의 種子를 産育하든 것과 대조하야 얼마나 朝鮮女性을 위하야 萬丈氣焰을 吐한 烈行이겟습니까. 羅朝의 眞德, 善德 二主의 賢德은 말할 것도 업고 麗太祖의 柳妃와 李高帝의 康后가 모다 英主의 賢助가 되어 化家爲國의 大業을 翼贊한 것이며 貞熹, 仁元의 二后가 國家危疑의 時에 際하야 聲色을 動치 안코 大策을 決行하야 王室의 基礎를 굿게 하든 力量을 發揮한 것이 또한 엇지 婦人으로 업수히 녁일 것이 입니까. 그 외에도 또한 師任堂 申氏의 胎敎는 東方聖人의 稱이 잇는 栗谷을 아들로 두게 되고 李朝의 中興功臣 李白沙 가튼 이도 그 모친 崔夫人의 敎導로써 비로소 저와 가티 성취된 것이 孟母上�遷의 敎가 반드시 擅美할 것이 되지 못함니다. 奇傑 林白湖가 許眉叟 가튼 外孫을 두엇스며 洪淵泉 3兄弟의 文章德行은 그 전부가 慈母 徐씨에게 밧은 것이외다. 蘭雪軒과 玉峰女史의 才學이며 論介, 桂月香의 義烈 등을 歷數하자면＜160＞ 도저히 제한잇는 紙面으로 萬一을 써볼 수가 업습니다. 나는 다음날 機會가 잇스면 비록 薄聞寡見이오 識淺文拙하지만은 東國哲媛을 網羅하야 一部의 單行本을 著輯할가 합니다만은 이 기회에 평소에 가장 존경하며 감탄하든 數 3女君子들의 至行과 賢智를 略述하야 塞責하고 擱筆하랴 합니다.

惠慶宮 洪氏(莊祖后)
惠慶宮은 籍이 豐山이오 永豐府院君 鳳漢의 長女인데 幼時부터 淑德이 놉고 英祖 甲子(距今 185년前)에 世子嬪으로 冊封되니 즉 莊祖 毅皇帝의 正后이다. 때에 莊祖가 東宮에 잇스사 父王의 代理로 萬機를 聽政하다가 奸細輩의 構陷한 바이 되어 畢竟  英祖 38년 壬午 閏 5월에 니르러 廢位가 되어 仍하야 萬古에 드문 慘變이 생겻다. 洪后는 時年 28세로 1子(正祖宣皇帝) 二女를 다리고 窮天極地의 애통을 품고 宮苑의 小屋에 廢囚되엿섯다. 후에 英祖가 悔悟하야 世子의 位號를 復하야 思悼의 謚을 賜하고 正祖로 世孫을 奉하야 효장세자(眞宗皇帝를 追崇)를 嗣케 하얏다가 英廟가 昇遐하매 大位를 踐하얏스나 旣히 伯父에게 出系한 形式이 되매 所生에 대하야 追尊치 못하고 惠慶宮이라 稱하야 存養할 뿐이엿다. 后는 壬午 以後로 含哀茹痛하야 生치 안으랴 하면서도 오즉 正祖 때문에 悲哀를 抑止하든 바 一邊으로 黨禍가 滔天하야 后의 本家는 그의 犧牲으로 誅戮이 相連하고 모다 廢枳이 되엿다. 그리다가 正祖의 昇遐 후에는 兇徒가 더욱 跋扈하야 后를 誣逼하야 難言의 變이 層生하얏다. 그러나 后는 前後의 逆境에 處하기 60년에 一毫의 怨嗟가 업고 오즉 運命의 指使에 順從하야 先世子와 先王의 冥福을 빌고 戚里를 深戒하야 權要의 地位를 바라지 안케 하고 一生의 血淚로써 懷抱를 記述하얏스니 『閒中漫錄』이라 하야 읽는 자로 一字 一涕케 하는 것이다. 李朝 后妃의 至德懿行을 가진 이가 만흐나 滄桑의 變故를 閱盡하얏고 貞淑和謹하야 百代의 龜鑑이 됨즉한 婦德 즉 子道, 妻道, 母道에 最善을 다한 이는 后로서 읏뜸이라 할 것이다. 天道는 善人을 佑하야 后는 遐齡을 克享하고 高宗 己亥에는 夫君과 함께 帝后로 追尊되니라.

許政丞姊氏
許琮은 陽川人이니 世祖때에 文科로 出身하야 李施愛의 亂을 平定하고 四朝에 歷事하며 出將入相하야 功勳이 赫然한 偉人이엿다. 그가 成宗때에 右議政을 拜하야 相府에 處할새 成宗의 妃 尹씨(燕山君의 生母)가 失寵하야 廢位가 되엿더니 다시 譖間이 생기여 將次 賜死의 命을 나리게 되엿다. 成宗은 元老大臣을 宮中에 召集하야 會議케 할 새 琮이 또한 時相으로 被召하야 赴闕하게 된지라 琮의 姊氏가 近地에 居住하고 일즉이 賢明 多智下며 料人과 料事에 長함으로 琮이 항상 兄으로 事하며 軍國 大事가 잇스면 반듯이 就議하야＜161＞ 그 姊의 指敎를 밧드니 이 날도 朝班에 參入하기 전에 그 姊氏를 차저 보고 稟議하얏다. 姊氏는 徐徐히 대답하되 『비록 天威 大震하야 臣下로써 犯顔 直鍊할 수는 업다 할지라도  譬컨대 私家의 老僕이 家主의 命을 違치 못하야 主母를 共殺함과 가트니 義分上으로 不敢할 뿐 안이라 他日에 主母의 아들이 繼立하는 때이면 그 일에 參與한 사람이 엇지 斬誅의 禍를 免하리오. 그대가 一門의 大禍를 避하랴 하면 맛당히 善處할 길이 잇스리라.』琮이 크게 깨닷고 社稷洞 自宅을 出하야 入朝하다가 橋하로 떠러저 負傷하고 그 會議에 參與치 안엇다. 其後 成宗이 昇遐하고 燕山이 卽位하야 母讐를 復할새 당시 參議하얏든 大臣 卿 宰를 一網打盡으로 殺戮하고 已死者는 剖棺碎骨의 極刑에 處하고 그 兄弟子姪을 族滅하얏스나 琮은 獨히 免禍하고 其弟 琛이 또한 相位에 올나 榮富를 누리니 그것이 모다 姊의 指示한 것이다. 지금 社稷洞에 琮沈橋(今稱宗橋)가 잇스니 當日 許琮이 墜車로 得名한 것이다.

李起築夫人
李起築은 仁祖 癸亥(距今 306년前) 反正功臣으로 靖社 3等勳에 策하야 完溪君을 奉하고 漢城府 判尹의 高官을 지낸 사람이다. 起築은 早孤하야 父母도 누구임을 모르고 本姓도 알지 못하며 오즉 己丑年生이라 하야 己丑으로 부르며 轉轉行乞하다가 公州 吏房의 집에 傭奴가 되어 沒炊에 從事할 새 偉人이 多力忠直하나 自不識丁으로 賤視하는 바가 되엿다. 吏房에게 1女가 잇서 年이 婚齡을 지내게 되고 또 美慧非常하며 文字를 解하야 부모가 寵愛하는 고로 佳壻를 택하야 出嫁식히랴 하나 女가 抵死拒辭하고 自己의 配偶者는 임의 心定한 곳이 잇슨 즉 他에 嫁치 안켓다 하니 父母가 其人을 問한 즉 己丑으로 對하는지라 부모가 怒하야 罵撻을 거듭하나 女의 意가 堅함으로 부득이 作婿하얏스나 근처에 두면 家門의 恥辱이라 하야 遠方으로 移居할 것을 명하얏다. 女가 역시 公州에 居生함을 원치 아니하고 其父로부터 약간의 錢財를 請하야 己丑과 함께 京城으로 移하야 平洞에 貰屋僦屋하고 賣酒로 資生하더니 때에 光海가 失政하야 母后를 幽閉하고 兄弟를 誅殺하며 逆獄이 頻仍하고 政治가 紊亂하얏다. 女가 一日은 己丑을 불너 通鑑 한 卷과 酒肴 한 床을 주며 『夫君이 이것을 가지고 彰義門外 某處 松林中에 가면 10여人의 名士가 會談할 것이니 몬저 주효를 進하고 飮畢하거든 冊의 標한 곳을 펴고 學書하기를 請하라. 그리하야 명사들을 請하야 吾家로 迎來케 하라』하니 己丑이 依言하야 指示處에 往見한 즉 과연 儒生 10餘人이 席地 團坐하야 무슨 秘議를 하다가 己丑을 보고 失驚하거늘 己丑이 入排하고 酒肴를 進하며 學書를 願하니 諸人이 더욱 相願 錯愕하니 그 사람들은 즉 金自點, 李時伯, 崔鳴吉, 沈器遠 등 諸人이오 己丑의  開示한 곳은 統監 제 4卷의 霍光이 昌邑王을 廢黜하든 句節이엿다. 諸人이 己丑에 故를 問하니 己丑이 이에 己妻의 所事임을 告하고 家中으로 迎來하니 女가 나오며 語하되 諸公의 行事를 내가 아는지라 世上에＜162＞ 엇지 無母의 國이 잇스리오. 제공의 계획은 神人이 협조할지니 成事가 無擬하도다. 그러나 郊外 會集이 人目을 끌기 容易하고 또 白面書生으로 大事를 經論하자면 武力의 助가 가장 필요하니 妾의 家가 僻在할 뿐 아니라 酒味가 劣치 안은 즉 飮酒에 假託하면 譏察이 及치 못할 것이오. 妾의 夫가 비록 無識하나 過人의 勇力이 잇고 素性이 忠直하야 大事를 可託할 것이니 事成之日에 忘棄치 마르소서.』 諸人이 驚喜하야 그의 말을 조츠니 女의 劃策이 料事如神하야 着着히 適中하얏다. 이때부터 己丑은 仁祖 潛邸에 出入하야 寵遇를 밧고 擧事日에 彰義門을 擊碎하고 驅兵 直入하야 反正을 成就하얏다. 朝堂에 모히여 論功과 行賞을 定할새 제1로 『平洞 酒母의 酬功할 것이』話題에 올느며 己丑이 策勳封君하고 女에게 특히 貞敬夫人의 號를 賜하고 仁祖가 御姓을 賜하야 李씨라 하며 己丑의 同音을 取하야 起築이라 稱하다.(附記 李起築의 事蹟에 대하야 正史는 이런 일을 否認한 곳이 잇스나 野談에 의하야 이대로 둔다.)

金文谷婦人 羅氏
金壽恒의 號는 文谷이니 淸陰 金尙憲의 孫이오 孝顯肅 三朝의 名臣이엿다. 그 妻 羅씨는 鷗浦 羅萬甲의 孫으로 甚히 婦德이 잇섯고 文谷에게 內助의 공이 만흐며 六子를 두엇스니 長은 昌集이오 次는 昌協, 昌翕, 昌業, 昌緝, 昌立으로 모다 忠節, 學行과 文章 才識이 잇서 世의 名人이 되엿다. 夫人이 知鑑이 잇서 料人에 長하더니 次子 農岩이 早年에 蔭科하야 新恩의 衫服으로 入謁한 즉 夫人이 感眉不悅하되 汝의 模樣은 山林處士와 갓다 하고 其後 長男 夢窩가 蔭官으로 晩科하야 入拜한 즉 撫背 大喜하면서『吾家에 眞 大臣이 再出하얏다』하더니 과연 農岩은 早廢하야 出仕치 안코 隱居하얏스며 夢窩는 壽位가 俱高하야 上相에 이르고 老論 4大臣으로 殉職하얏다. 또 夫人은 治家가 嚴肅하고 自奉이 儉薄하야 政丞의 孫婦로 政丞의 妻로 政丞의 母로 政丞의 弟嫂로 門庭이 烜爀하야 貴盛이 莫甚하얏스나 一生에 布裾荊釵로 寒士家 主婦처럼 지내고 綺羅의 *을 身에 近치 아니하얏다. 某 公主家에 慶宴이 잇서 內外貴賓이 畢集하얏슬 때에 夫人이 또한 往參하니 公主가 執禮 甚恭하는지라 때에 모든 諸 貴婦人이 綾羅와 珠翠로 粧身하얏다가 夫人을 보고 何許濱婆에게 主人이 恭敬하나 하야 疑訝하다가 後에 文谷夫人인 줄을 알고 서로 羞慚하얏다 한다. 夫人이 또 愛女가 잇서 擇婿할 새 제3子 三淵으로 하야금 閔씨 諸兒中에게 看選하라 하니 三淵이 往見復命하되 閔家兒에서는 可合者가 업다 하고 李氏家에 定婚하얏섯다. 婚日을 當하야 新郞을 보고 夫人이 三淵을 責하되 李郞의 儀容은 비록 美하나 遠大의 器가 아니오 壽限도 不足하겟거늘 汝의 鑑識이 엇지 不精함이 若是하뇨 하야 咄嘆을 마지 안엇다. 後에 閔氏群 從兄弟가 來遊 하거늘 三淵이 入告 曰『母氏가 恒常 閔家와 결혼치 못함을 恨하니 이제 閔氏少年이 모힌지라 一次 窺視하소서』부인이 門隙으로 一見하고 다시 三淵을 大責 曰 諸閔이 모다 榮達할 相이어늘 汝가 失하얏스니 가위 有眼無珠라 하얏다. 과연 李는 未滿 30에 一官을 得치 못하고 夭逝하얏고 閔氏 諸兄弟는 趾齋 丹岩 등 名公鉅卿이 輩出하게 되어 三淵 晩年에 其 母의 藻監如神한 것을 敬服하얏다.＜163＞
