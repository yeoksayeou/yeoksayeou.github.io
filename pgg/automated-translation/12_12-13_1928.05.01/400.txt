Feeling at the Sal River
Igye Hong Yang-ho

Feeling at the Sal River
Igye Hong Yang-ho

The million Sui soldiers turned into insects and sand,
For a thousand years, the clear Sal River has stirred up white waves.
The rise and fall of previous dynasties are empty like reflections in the water and moon,
Eulji's achievements fill the mountains and rivers.
Even foreigners know of the greatness of the Three Han,
The nation must ultimately have one great man.
I solely lament Nam Jeoldo of the past,
Even though men die, they only think of the Yalu River.

Celebrating the Victory Against the Japanese Pirates
Mogeun Yi Saek

Your majestic presence shook the ocean for ten thousand miles,
Snowy hair and frosted whiskers on both cheeks.
Even more joyous is the peace of the nation in one morning,
Great achievements upon great achievements. <101>

薩水有感
耳溪 洪良浩

隋兵百萬化虫沙, 淸薩千年起白波. 前代興亡空水月, 乙支勳業滿山河. 華夷尙識三韓大, 社稷終須一士多. 獨恨往時南節度, 男兒雖死唯陽河

賀戰退倭寇
牧隱 李穡

鯨波萬里振威風, 雪鬂霜髭兩頰江, 更喜一朝安社稷, 大山功上大山功＜101＞
