The Transition of Korean Traditional Music and Famous Figures in the Music Scene of Each Dynasty
						P'ungnyu Rang

It is written in old records that Tangun used sacred music when offering sacrifices to Heaven, and that Kija brought musicians with him when he migrated east, but we cannot know for sure what kind of music existed at that time. Later, in the Three Kingdoms period, music developed considerably, and there were many famous musicians. In the Koguryŏ period during the reign of King P'yŏngwŏn (around 560 AD), the State Minister Wang San-ak (王山岳) was a natural music sage who created the hŭn'gŭm (玄琴, black zither) after seeing the seven-stringed zither of Chin (晋), and composed over 100 songs. Because its melody was clear and elegant, when played, black cranes fluttered and danced, it was called Hŭn'gakkŭm (玄鶴琴, Black Crane Zither). In Silla, during the reign of King Chinhŭng, a person named Ok Po-go (玉寶高) entered Unsangwŏn (雲上院) on Mt. Chiri (智異山, i.e. Mt. Chiri) and studied the kŭm (zither) for 50 years, creating 30 new melodies. It is said that the music was so clear, elegant, divine, and mysterious that when played, mountain birds and fish all came to listen.

Ok Po-go passed this on to Songmyŏngdŭk (續命得), and Dŭk in turn passed it on to Kwigŭm (貴金). Because Kim did not seek worldly success, the King of Silla worried that the way of the kŭm would be cut off, so he appointed Ichan Yunhŭng (伊湌允興) to the position of Namwŏn Kongsa (南原公事) to pass on the way of the kŭm. When Yunhŭng arrived at his post, he selected two intelligent young boys, Anjang (安長) and Ch'ŏngjang (淸長), and sent them to the mountains to learn the kŭm from Teacher Kwigŭm. The teacher taught them, but did not teach them the mysteries, so Yunhŭng visited the teacher with his wife and pleaded, saying, "The reason His Majesty sent me to Namwŏn is to learn the way of the kŭm from you, but it has been three years now and you have kept secrets and not taught us. What face can I show to His Majesty when I report back?" Yunhŭng offered wine, and his wife held the cup and paid respects, and only then did Kwigŭm teach them the technique, passing on three songs including P'yop'ung (飄風). Anjang passed it on to his sons Kŭksang (克相) and Kŭkchong (克宗), and Kŭkchong created seven songs. After Kŭkchong, the way of the kŭm was widely passed down in the world, and there were two modes of music: one was P'yŏngjo (平調), and the other was Ujo (羽調), totaling 187 songs. The 30 songs created by Ok Po-go were Sangwŏn'gok (上院曲), Hawŏn'gok (下院曲), Chungwŏn'gok (中院曲), Namhaegok (南海曲), Ŭiamgok (倚岩曲), Noingok (老人曲), Chukamgok (竹庵曲), Ch'unjo'gok (春朝曲), Ch'usŏkgok (秋夕曲), Wŏn'ang'gok (鴛鴦曲), etc. In Kaya, King Kasill (嘉悉王) created the twelve-stringed kayagŭm (伽倻琴) to represent the twelve months, and the musician Uruk (于勒, from Sŏngsuk-in [省熟人], present-day Ch'ŏngp'ung [淸風]) composed 12 songs, which is the kayagŭm of today. At that time, King Chinhŭng of Silla conquered Tae Kaya (大伽倻國) and made a royal tour of Nangsong (狼城, present-day Ch'ŏngju [淸州]), and upon hearing that Uruk and <154> his disciple Nigŭm (尼今) were skilled in music, he ordered them to be brought to him. Uruk came with inferior instruments, so the King resided in Harimgung (河臨宮) and listened to Uruk's new song, and had him stay in Kugwŏn (國原, Wŏnju [原州]) (because Uruk played the kŭm at T'ant'aedae [彈琴臺] in Ch'ungju [忠州] at that time, the place name is still called that). The following year, the King sent Pŏpchi (法知), Kyego (階古), and Mandŏk (萬德) to learn music from Uruk. The three men learned 11 songs from Uruk and said to each other, "This is lascivious, let's revise it and correct it." and made five new songs. At first, Uruk knew this and was angry, but when he listened to the five songs, he shed tears and said, "This is music, but it is not lascivious, and it is sad, but it is not sorrowful, so it can be called Correct Music." Later, Uruk taught Kyego the kayagŭm, Pŏpchi the song, and Mandŏk the dance, and they all became masters. There are two modes of kayagŭm: one is Harimjo (河臨調) and the other is Nŭnjukcho (嫩竹調), totaling 185 songs. In Silla, the kayagŭm, song, and dance taught by Uruk were made the official music of the state, and the 12 songs created by Uruk were Haga'radu (下伽羅都), Sanga'radu (上伽羅都), Bo'gi (寶技), Talgi (達己), etc. During the reign of King Sinmun of Silla, an unusual bamboo was taken from Chungpudo (中浮島) in the East Sea and made into Manp'asikchŏk (萬波息笛, flute that calms ten thousand waves), and the country was at peace. The Ch'ŏnghwangnyangyokchŏk (靑皇兩玉笛, Blue and Yellow Jade Flutes), which are now handed down as Silla antiques, are also relics from that time. At that time, the types of musical instruments included hŭn'gŭm, kayagŭm, pipa, taegŭm (大笒, large bamboo flute), chunggŭm (中笒, medium bamboo flute), so'gŭm (小笒, small bamboo flute), p'akpan (拍板, clapper), and taegŭ (大鼓, large drum) in Silla; ohyŏn'gŭm (5絃琴, five-stringed zither), p'iri (篳篥), so (簫), ku (鼓), and tongnu jong (銅鏤鐘, bronze bell) in Koguryŏ; and koku (鼓角, horn), konghu (箜篌, harp), kanchi (竿箎, long flute), chŏk (笛, flute), and kŭm (琴, zither) in Paekche. Also, Koguryŏ had a tradition of harmonizing songs by blowing on the no (蘆, reed), and Silla also had Hoerak (會樂), Sinhaellak (辛熱樂), Chira'ak (枝兒樂), Sunae'ak (思內樂), Michi'ak (美知樂), etc.

However, the establishment of the three types of distinctions, so-called a'ak (雅樂, court music), tang'ak (唐樂, Chinese-derived music), and sog'ak (俗樂, folk music), began in the Koryŏ Dynasty. Sog'ak is the native music, with 24 songs including Tongdong (動動), Sŏgyŏng (西京), Taedonggang (大洞江), and Ogwansan (五冠山), as well as Silla sog'ak, all using the native language. Tang'ak was transmitted from China before King Yejong (睿宗) of Koryŏ, and it was revised in the native country, with about 40 songs including Hŏnsŏnt'o (獻仙桃), Sujŏngjang (壽廷長), Oyangsŏn (五洋仙), and P'ogullak (抛球樂). Among them, there are also the words of Pukp'o Tongwan (北暴東頑), where Puk (北) is the Khitan mode and Tong (東) is the Japanese mode. Next, a'ak was used for suburban shrines and ancestral temples during the reign of King Sŏngjong (成宗), and when Emperor Huizong (徽宗) of Song (宋) sent Taesŏngak (大晟樂) during the reign of King Yejong, it was recommended to the T'aemyo (太廟, Royal Ancestral Shrine), and the musical composition of Kulsil Tŭngga (九室登歌) was newly created. King Yejong especially liked music and often discussed rites and music with civil officials, and he favored court ladies such as Ryŏngnyong (玲瓏) and Ŏgun (遏雲), who were skilled in music, to the point that he was admonished by the T'aehak student Ko Hyo-ch'ung (高孝忠). Later, during the reign of King Myŏngjong (明宗), military officials such as Chŏng Chung-bu (鄭仲夫) were rampant and culture declined, so musicians fled and music became disordered. Later, during the reign of King Kongmin (恭愍王), a'ak was temporarily revived, and musical compositions were newly created several times, but during the Red Turban Rebellion (紅巾賊亂), the Taesŏngak of the past Song Dynasty and other musical instruments were lost and scattered, and only two instruments, the chong (鍾, bell) and p'an (磐, stone chime), were thrown into the pond by old musicians and barely preserved. When Emperor Taizu (太祖) of Ming (明) sent p'yŏnjong (編鐘, set of bells) and p'yŏnggyŏng (編磬, set of stone chimes) again, the King sent T'aesang (太常) musicians to learn music, and at that time a'ak was mostly from Song and Ming.

Speaking of the musical instruments of the Koryŏ Dynasty, a'ak used chong (鐘), kyŏng (磬), kŭm (琴), pi (毖), so (簫), chŏk (笛), saeng (笙), ku (鼓), etc., tang'ak used panghyang (方響), tongso (洞簫), chŏk (笛), ajaeng (牙箏), <155> taegŭm (大箏), and kyobanggo (敎坊鼓), and sog'ak used hŭn'gŭm (玄琴), kayagŭm (伽倻琴), taegŭm (大琴), ajakmu'ae (牙拍無㝵), mugo (舞鼓), kyegŭm (稽琴), and chunggŭm (中笒). P'iri (篳栗), pipa (琵琶), changgo (杖鼓), and p'ak (拍) were used in both tang'ak and sog'ak. Also, the music attire was that the dance troupe wore black shirts, the music officials wore red clothes, and the female entertainers wore danjang (丹粧, makeup) for tang'ak and sog'ak.

In the early Chosŏn Dynasty, the Ming music of the Koryŏ period was used as it was, but the sounds were not in tune with the musical scale, and the eight tones were not complete for ritual music, so the pan (磐) was a clay tile pan (瓦磐), and the chong (鐘) was also hung randomly, and the number was incomplete. In the autumn of the 7th year of King Sejong (世宗), Ŭlsa (乙巳) (1425 AD), kŏuch'il (柜漆, 1 grain 1 pun 9 ch'on) was produced in Haeju (海州), so King Sejong ordered Pak (朴) (surnamed T'anbu [坦夫], pen name Nangye [蘭溪], from Miryang [密陽]), who was famous as a musician at the time, to create 12 pitches (1 grain was made into 1 pun, and 9 ch'on was made into the length of Hwangjong [黃鍾]; 12 pitches were made by adding or subtracting 3 pun). In the spring of the following year, kyŏngsŏk (磬石, chime stone) was produced in Namyang (南陽), so King Sejong again ordered Yŏm (堧) to make a new pan and present it. King Sejong tried playing it and said, "The sound of the new kyŏng is clear and beautiful, but why is only one piece of Ijik (夷則) not in harmony?" After examining it, Yŏm said, "The ink line (限墨) is still there, so it has not been fully polished," and immediately polished the ink mark, and the kyŏng sound was completely harmonious. From this, Yŏm was put in charge of music, and from then on a'ak became a great success, and female entertainers were not used in ceremonial occasions, and Chongdaeŏp (定大業), Yŏminnak (與民樂), and P'otaep'yŏng (保太平) were composed to describe the merits of the ancestors. Chang Yŏng-sil (蔣英實), a famous craftsman at the time, also contributed greatly to the manufacture of these musical instruments. (At that time, Pyŏn Kye-ryang [卞季良] also made and presented Hwasan Pyŏlgok [華山別曲], which was recorded in the Music Bureau [樂府].) Also, until the time of King Sŏngjong (成宗), the lyrics of the late Koryŏ period were used as they were and learned at the Changnagwŏn (掌樂院, Office of Music, first established during the reign of King Sŏngjong). In the 21st year, Kyŏngsul (庚戌), T'ŭkp'yŏng Kwŏn Chu (權柱) petitioned that it was a remnant of a fallen country and that there were many phrases of love between men and women, so it was advisable to abolish it. King Sŏngjong adopted his words and had Ŏ Se-gyŏm (魚世謙) and Sŏng Hyŏn (成俔) create Ssanghwagok (雙花曲), Ryŏsangok (履相曲), etc., and revised the licentious words in Puktjŏn'ga (北殿歌), which can be said to be a major innovation in lyrics. Also, the Akhak Kwebŏm (樂學軌範) compiled at that time is the oldest music book in Chosŏn and a famous work in musicology, so it is imaginable how much Chosŏn revered music at that time. After King Sŏngjong, during the reign of Yŏnsan, female entertainers were revered and the capital became a street of song and dance, but on the other hand, chŏngak (正樂, court music) was abandoned and stagnated. During the reign of King Yŏngjo (英宗), as a result of encouraging rites and music, chŏngak was temporarily revived, but the vicissitudes of time had a great impact on the music world, and by the end of the Chosŏn Dynasty, this world had reached a state of utter desolation and ruin. However, because the offices related to music were always established and also considered important throughout the dynasties, the number of people belonging to the Music Bureau was always considerable, as can be seen from the fact that the number of personnel reached over 770 even during the Kwangmu years (光武年間) recently. However, there were 66 kinds of musical instruments used in ancient a'ak, but there are currently 54 kinds existing in the Yi Royal Family. If we divide them into detail, (1) the metal section (金部) includes 10 kinds: p'yŏnjong (編鐘), t'ŭkchong (特鐘), panghyang (方響), yanggŭm (洋琴), chŏp'ara (啫哱囉), nappa (喇叭), taegŭm (大金), so'gŭm (小金), chŏng (鉦), na (鑼), etc.; (2) the stone section (石部) includes 2 kinds: p'yŏn'gyŏng (編馨) and t'ŭkkyŏng (特馨); (3) the silk section (絲部) includes 10 kinds: kŭm (琴), sŭl (瑟), hŭn'gŭm (玄琴), kayagŭm (伽倻琴), Tang pipa (唐琵琶), Hyang pipa (鄕琵琶), ajaeng (牙箏), taegŭm (大箏), wŏlgŭm (月琴), haegŭm (奚琴), etc.; (4) the bamboo section (竹部) includes 11 kinds: taegŭm (大笒), Tang chŏk (唐笛), Tang p'iri (唐觱篥), Hyang p'iri (鄕觱篥), se p'iri (細觱篥), tongso (洞簫), so (簫), tanch'o (短簫), ch'i (箎), chwŏk (篴), so (簫), etc.; (5) the gourd section (匏部) includes 1 kind: saeng (笙); (6) the earth section (土部) includes 3 kinds: pu (缶), hun (塤), and nagak (螺角); (7) the leather section (革部) includes 13 kinds: kŏn'go (建鼓), chinggo (晉鼓), ŭnggo (應鼓), sakko (朔鼓), chunggo (中鼓), chŏlgo (節鼓), kyobanggo (敎坊鼓), chwago (座鼓), <156> yongnyu (龍¼“), changgo (杖鼓), kyŏlkko (羯鼓), nogo (路鼓), noto (路鼗), etc.; (8) the wood section (木部) includes 4 kinds: p'ak (拍), chuk (祝), ŏ (敔), and T'aep'yŏngso (太平簫). Furthermore, there were 1,900 songs in the past, but now there are only 50 songs left. Among them, 13 songs are Chou (周) songs, 20 songs are Sui (隋) and Tang (唐) poems and songs. In addition, 19 kinds are ancient Korean songs (Three Kingdoms and Koryŏ Dynasties), and if we divide them by religion, there are 4 kinds: Sŏn'gok (仙曲), Pulgok (佛曲), Yugok (儒曲), and Sin'gok (神曲). Next, as for the musicians, Hwang Hyo-sŏng (黃孝誠) was a master in this field during the reign of King Sejo (世祖), and as for skilled performers, Song T'aep'yŏng (宋太平) of Chŏn'nak (典樂) was famous as the best player of Hyang pipa (唐琵琶을 倣하야 作한 者인데 機 設掛는 玄琴과 同함, a pipa made in imitation of the Tang pipa, but the mechanism and hanging are the same as the hŭn'gŭm) during the reign of King Sŏngjong, and his name shook the world at that time. His son Chŏn Su (田守) also inherited his method and was equally famous with To Sŏn-gil (都善吉), and Chŏn Su was even better at playing the Tang pipa, and Kim Sin-bŏm (金臣番), a high disciple of To Sŏn-gil, also obtained a wonderful technique. Kim Cha-rye (金自麗) was a skilled player of hŭn'gŭm during the reign of King Sejong, and the blind man Yi Pan (李班) was also a skilled player and was favored by King Sejong and went in and out of the palace. At the same time, among the entertainers, Kim Tae-jŏng (金大丁), Yi Ma (李亇, sound Ma), Chi Kwŏn-mi (知權美), and Chang Ch'un (張春) were all masters. At that time, the commentators evaluated that Tae-jŏng was simple and strict, and Ma-ji was exquisite and mysterious, and each obtained his own mystery. However, Ma-ji was unparalleled in the capital and was treated favorably among the literati and even received the favor of the king and became a Nakchŏn (樂典, music master). Also, at the same time, Nakchŏn Kim Nak (金樂) and Nakkong Chŏng Ok (鄭玉) were also masters, and among the female entertainers, Sangnim Ch'un (上林春) can be said to be a red dot in a green bush (萬綠叢中 一點紅), receiving the love of the general public. Hwang Kwi-jon (黃貴存) and Kim Pok-san (金卜山) were contemporaries of Kayagŭm, and Kim So-sa (金召史), a working woman, was an unsurpassed master, teaching Ma-ji and others. As for his seniors, he was originally the wife of a certain gonghu (公侯) family who was found guilty and exiled to the countryside, where he spread his wonderful method widely in the foreign country, and at that time, the blind man Chŏng Pŏm (鄭凡) also had considerable skill and was widely praised by the world. During the reign of King Sejong, Hŏ O-gye (許吾繼), Yi Sŭng-nyŏn (李勝連), and Sŏ Ik-sŏng (徐益成) were also famous. Sŭng-nyŏn was known to King Sejong and appointed to a military position, and Ik-sŏng was hired as a kŭm master in Japan and died in Japan, and Kim To-ch'i (金都致) was a master of Ajaeng, and before him, Kim So-jae (金小材) was a master of his skills, and he also went to Japan and died. Since then, there have been many famous figures in the music world in successive generations, so I cannot list them all one by one, but among the Yi Wangjik A'akdae (李王職雅樂隊, Yi Royal Family A'ak Troupe) at present, the leader of the musicians, the old man Myŏng Wan-byŏk (明完璧), whose name is Wan-byŏk, can be said to be Wan-byŏk in the music world. He is especially skilled in songs and kayagŭm, and the musician Ham Hwa-jin-gun (咸和鎭君) is the son of the former leader of the musicians, Ham Chae-yun-ssi (咸在韻氏), and is skilled in general music, especially hŭn'gŭm, and Kim Nyŏng-je-gun (金寧濟君), who competes with him, was a master of kayagŭm. And among the musicians, Ch'oe Sun-yŏng-gun (崔淳永君)'s P'iri, Yi Su-gyŏng-gun (李壽景君)'s Taegŭm, Pak Tŏk-in-gun (朴德仁君)'s Saenghwang (笙簧), Yŏm Tŏk-su-gun (劮德秀君)'s Ch'ilhyŏn'gŭm (七玄琴), Myŏng Ho-jin (Myŏng Wan-byŏk's son) (明鎬振君)'s Kayagŭm, and Pak Ch'ang-gyun-gun (朴昌均君)'s Taegŭm are all unparalleled in the present world. And even though there are some differences in their ways from them, there are also many people who are currently famous in the ancient music world in the secular world. Pak P'al-gwa (朴八卦) and Sim Chŏng-sun (深正淳)'s Kayagŭm are so skilled that they can be said to be the two greatest in the present world, and Chi Ryong-gu (池龍九)'s Haegŭm and Cho Tong-sŏk (趙東奭)'s Tanch'o are masters among masters, able to make people laugh and able to make people cry, and no one can help but admire them three times after hearing them once. Cho Ŭi-sun (趙彛淳) can be said to be a master of Hŭn'gŭm, and the old man Paek Yong-jin (白溶鎭) is a master of Western music, and Kim Kye-sŏn (金桂善)'s Changchwŏk is also unparalleled in the present world. Olchi, the great master of songs, Ha Kyu-il (河奎一) will occupy the first place. He is a man of romance, and although his body is in the Hwaryukyobang (花柳敎坊), he is a great master of songs for generations, competing with the old man Myŏng Wan-byŏk of the A'akdae, and Mr. Myŏng is also a high disciple of Ha Chun-gwŏn-ssi (河俊權氏), the father of Ha Kyu-il. In addition, there are many people whose names are known in Seoul and the countryside, but I will postpone this to another opportunity and omit it here. <157>

朝鮮 古樂의 變遷과 歷代 樂壇의 名人物
						風流郞
壇君이 한울에 祭祀 지낼 때에 벌서 神樂을 쓰고 箕子가 東으로 망명할 적에 또한 樂師를 다리고 왓다는 말은 녯 記錄에 잇지만은 그때에 과연 엇더한 音樂이 잇섯던지 그것은 자서이 알 수가 업다. 그 뒤 三國時代에 이르러서는 음악이 상당히 발달되고 音樂家도 또한 名人物이 만헛스니 즉 高句麗 平原王時代(西紀 560년頃)에 國相 王山岳은 天縱의 樂聖으로 晋의 7絃琴을 보고 玄琴(검은고)을 創製하고 100여 곡을 作하니 그 操가 淸雅하야 奏할 때에는 玄鶴이 翩翲來舞함으로 玄鶴琴이라 稱하얏고 新羅에는 眞興王 때에 玉寶高라 하는 이가 地理山(卽 智異山) 雲上院에 드러가서 琴을 專門으로 學한지 50년에 新調 30곡을 創製하니 그 曲이 淸雅 神妙하야 한번 奏하면 山禽遊魚가 다와서 드럿다 한다.
玉寶高는 此를 續命得에게 傳하고 得은 또 貴金에게 傳하엿더니 金이 또한 地理山에 드러가서 出世치 안이함으로 新羅王이 琴道가 斷絶할가 憂慮하야 伊湌允興으로 南原公事에 任하야 琴道를 傳케 하니 允興이 官에 到하야 聰明少年 安長, 淸長 두 사람을 擇하야 山中에 가서 貴金先生에게 琴을 學케 하니 先生이 敎하나 그 奧妙한 것을 가르치지 안이함으로 允興이 그 妻와 함기 先生을 보고 請하야 曰 我王이 나를 南原에 보낸 것은 先生의 琴道를 學코자 함이거늘 이제 3년이 되도록 先生이 秘하고 敎치 안이하니 내가 무슨 面目으로 王께 復命하리요. 하고 允興은 酒를 奉하고 그 妻는 盞을 執하야 禮를 하니 貴金이 비로소 그 技術을 가르처서 飄風 등 3曲을 傳하얏스며 安長은 또 其子 克相와 克宗에게 傳하니 克宗이 7曲을 製하고 克宗의 後에는 琴道가 世에 널리 傳한바 그 音曲이 2調가 잇스니 1은 平調요 2는 羽調로 共히 187곡이오. 玉寶高의 製한 30곡은 上院曲, 下院曲, 中院曲, 南海曲, 倚岩曲, 老人曲, 竹庵曲, 春朝曲, 秋夕曲, 鴛鴦曲 등이엿다. 그리고 伽倻國에 잇서서는 嘉悉王이 12월을 像하야 12絃琴을 創製하고 樂師 于勒(省熟人 卽 今 淸風)으로 12곡을 製하얏스니 이것이 즉 오늘의 伽倻琴이엿다. 當時 新羅 眞興王은 大伽倻國을 滅하고 狼城(今 淸州)에 巡幸하다가 于勒과＜154＞ 그 弟子 尼今이 音樂에 善함을 聞하고 命하야 招來하니 于勒이 惡器를 携하고 來함으로 王이 河臨宮에 御하야 于勒의 製한 新曲을 聞하고 國原(原州)에 留케 하더니(當時 于勒이 忠州 彈琴臺에서 彈琴한 고로 地名도 仍稱함) 그 翌年에 王은 法知, 階古, 萬德을 보내 于勒에게 音樂을 學케 하니 3人이 于勒에게 11곡을 學하고 相謂 曰 此는 繁淫하니 다시 攊�正하자 하고 새로 5곡을 맨드니 于勒이 츠음에는 그것을 알고 怒하다가 밋 5곡을 드르매 눈물을 흘니며 曰 此는 樂하나 淫치 안이하고 哀하나 悲치 안이하니 可謂 正樂이라 하겟다 하얏섯다. 그 뒤에 于勒이 階古에게는 伽倻琴을 가르치고 法知에게는 歌를 가르치고 萬德에게는 舞를 가르치니 다 大家가 되엿다 한다. 伽倻琴은 2調가 잇스니 1은 河臨調요 1은 嫩竹調니 共히 185곡이다. 新羅에서는 이 于勒의 가르친 伽倻琴과 歌, 舞를 國家의 正樂으로 삼엇슴은 물론이오 于勒의 製한 12곡은 下伽羅都, 上伽羅都, 寶技, 達己 등이엿다. 그리고 新羅 神文王 때에는 東海 中浮島에서 異竹을 取하야 萬波息笛을 맨드러 부르니 國內가 太平하얏다 하고 지금에 新羅 古物로 傳하는 靑皇兩玉笛도 또한 당시 遺物이다. 그 때 악기의 종류로 말하면 新羅에는 玄琴, 伽倻琴, 琵琶, 大笒, 中笒, 小笒, 拍板, 大鼓 등이 잇섯고, 高句麗에는 5絃琴,篳篥簫鼓, 銅鏤鐘 등이 잇섯고, 百濟에는 鼓角, 箜篌, 竿箎, 笛, 琴 등이 잇섯고 또 高句麗는 蘆를 吹하야 曲을 和하는 事가 잇섯스며 新羅에는 또 會樂, 辛熱樂, 枝兒樂, 思內樂, 美知樂 등이 잇섯다.
그러나 所謂 雅樂, 唐樂, 俗樂의 3종 구별이 확립하기는 高麗時代부터 엿스니 俗樂은 즉 本國樂으로 動動, 西京, 大洞江, 五冠山 등 24곡이 잇는 외에 新羅 俗樂이 잇슷스니 다 本國語를 用하고 唐樂은 高麗 睿宗 以前에 支那에서 傳來한 者로 本國에서 改正한 것이니 獻仙桃, 壽廷長, 五洋仙, 抛球樂 등 凡 40여 곡이다. 其中에는 北暴東頑의 詞가 또 잇스니 北은 契丹調요 東은 日本調이다. 次의 雅樂은 成宗 때에 郊社 宗廟에 用하더니 睿宗때에 宋*徽宗이 大晟樂을 보냄으로 此를 太廟에 薦하고 九室登歌의 樂章을 新製하얏다. 睿宗은 특히 音樂을 好하야 文官으로 더부러 항상 禮樂을 論講하고 당시 樂妓로 音曲에 能한 玲瓏, 遏雲 등을 寵愛하다가 太學生 高孝忠에게 諷諫을 當한 일까지 잇섯다. 그러다가 明宗때에 와서 鄭仲夫 등 武臣이 跋扈하야 文敎가 退廢하니 樂工 등이 다 逃竄함으로 樂이 遂히 錯難하게 되엿섯다. 그 뒤 恭愍王때에 이르러서는 雅樂이 一時 復興하야 樂章도 屢次 新製하얏스나 紅巾賊亂에 往昔宋의 大晟樂과 기타 惡器를 散失하고 오즉 鍾磐 2器만 老伶이 池中에 投하야 僅히 保存하얏슬 뿐이러니 明太祖가 다시 編鐘編磐을 送함으로 王은 太常 樂工을 보내서 習樂케 하얏스니 당시 雅樂은 대개가 宋明의 것이엇다.
麗朝 때의 惡器로 말하면 雅樂에는 鐘, 磬, 琴, 毖, 簫, 笛, 笙, 鼓 등을 用하고 唐樂에는 方響, 洞簫, 笛, 牙箏,＜155＞ 大箏, 敎坊鼓를 用하고 俗樂에는 玄琴, 伽倻琴, 大琴, 牙拍無㝵, 舞鼓, 稽琴, 中笒을 用하고 觱栗, 琵琶, 杖鼓, 拍, 등은 唐樂, 俗樂에 倂用하얏다. 又 樂服은 唐樂 俗樂에는 舞隊는 皀衫이오, 樂官은 朱衣오 妓는 丹粧이엿다.
李朝초에는 麗代의 明樂을 그대로 썻스나 聲音이 律에 不中하야 祭樂에 8音이 不備함으로 磐은 瓦磐을 用하고 鐘도 또한 雜懸하야 其數가 不備하더니 世宗 7년 乙巳(西紀 1425) 秋에 柜漆(1粒 1分 9寸)가 海州에 産함으로 世宗이 당시 음악가로 유명한 朴(字 坦夫, 號 蘭溪, 密陽人)을 命하야 12律을 作케 하고 1粒으로 爲1分하고 9寸으로 爲黃鍾之長하니 3分 損益에 成 12律이다). 그 翌年 春에는 南陽에 磬石이 産出함으로 世宗은 다시 堧을 命하야 新磐을 造하야 進하니 世宗이 試奏하고 曰 新磬의 聲이 淸美하되 다만 夷則一枚가 聲이 和하지 못함이 何故오 하니 堧이 審視한 후 奏하야 曰 限墨이 尙在하야 盡磨치 못한 所以라 하고 곳 墨痕을 磨하니 磬聲이 盡和하엿다. 이에 堧으로 하야금 樂事를 專掌케 하니 이로부터 雅樂이 大成하야 會禮에 女樂을 쓰지 안코 또 祖宗의 功德을 述하야 定大業, 與民樂, 保太平 등을 作하니 당시 工藝家로 高名한 蔣英實은 이 惡器製造에 또한 功이 만헛섯다.(其 時 卞季良은 또 華山別曲을 製進함으로 樂府에 載하얏다.) 그리고 歌詞는 成宗時代까지 麗末時代의 가사를 그대로 仍用하야 掌樂院(成宗時에 始置 掌樂院)에서 學習하다가 21년 庚戌에 特平 權柱가 上奏하되 그것은 亡國의 餘響으로 其中 男女 相悅의 詞가 또한 만흔 즉 廢止함이 可하다 함으로 成宗은 그 말을 採用하야 魚世謙 成俔 등으로 雙花曲, 履相曲 등을 作케 하고 且 北殿歌 중에 淫*의 詞를 改選하얏스니 이것은 歌詞의 一大 革新이라 하겟스며 又 當時에 編纂한 樂學軌範은 朝鮮 最古의 音樂書로 樂學上 유명한 著作이니 당시 朝鮮에서 音樂을 여하히 崇尙하엿던 것을 可히 想像할 수 잇다. 成宗後 燕山朝 時代에는 女樂을 숭상하야 國都가 일시 歌舞의 巷으로 化얏스나 그 반면에 正樂은 도로혀 荒廢 不振하다가 英宗時代에 禮樂을 장려한 결과로 正樂도 일시 부흥하얏더니 時運의 변천은 樂界까지 영향이 크세 밋처서 李朝 말엽에 至하야는 斯界가 아주 蕭索殘滅의 상태에 이르럿다. 그러나 歷代로 음악에 관한 職制를 常置하고 또한 重要視한 까닭에 樂院에 속한 인원은 항상 적지 안엇스니 최근 光武年間까지도 그 人員이 770여 명에 달한 것을 보면 足히 알 수가 잇다. 然而 古來 雅樂에 用하는 악기는 66種이엿스나 금일 李王家에 現存한 者는 54종이니 此를 細分하면 (1) 金部는 編鐘, 特鐘, 方響, 洋琴, 啫哱囉, 喇叭, 大金, 小金, 鉦, 鑼, 등 10종 (2) 石部는 編馨, 特馨 등 2종, (3) 絲部는 琴, 瑟, 玄琴, 伽倻琴, 唐琵琶, 鄕琵琶, 牙箏, 大箏, 月琴, 奚琴 등 10종, (4)竹部는 大笒, 唐笛, 唐觱篥, 鄕觱篥, 細觱篥, 洞簫, 簫, 短簫, 箎, 篴, 簫 등 11종 (5) 匏部는 笙 1종, (6) 土部는 缶, 塤, 螺角 등 3종, (7) 革部는 建鼓, 晉鼓, 應鼓, 朔鼓, 中鼓, 節鼓, 敎坊鼓, 座鼓,＜156＞ 龍¼“, 杖鼓, 羯鼓, 路鼓, 路鼗 등 13종, (8) 木部는 拍, 祝, 敔, 太平簫 등 4종이요 尙又 樂曲은 自來 1,900여 편이엿스나 현재에는 50여 편 뿐이니  其中 13편은 周曲이요 20여 편은 隋唐詩曲이요. 此外 19종은 古朝鮮曲(三國 及 麗代)이니 此를 宗敎別로 구분하면 仙曲, 佛曲, 儒曲, 神曲 등 4종이다. 次에 樂師로 말하면 世祖때에 黃孝誠이 斯界 명인이엿고 樂技의 善手로 말하면 成宗時代에 鄕琵琶(唐琵琶을 倣하야 作한 者인데 機 設掛는 玄琴과 同함)로는 典樂 宋太平이 天下善手로 名이 당시 一世를 振하얏스며 其 子 田守가 또한 其 法을 傳하야 都善吉과 가티 齊名하얏는데 其 中 田守는 唐琵琶를 더욱 善彈하얏스며 都善吉의 高弟로는  伶人 金臣番이 또한 妙法을 어덧섯다. 玄琴은 世宗때에 金自麗라는 사람이 善手엿고 盲人 李班이 또한 善手로 世宗의 寵愛를 바더서 禁中에 출입을 하얏섯다. 그와 동시에 伶人중에는 金大丁, 李亇(音마), 知權美, 張春等이 다 名手엿스니 당시 論者들은 評하기를 大丁은 簡嚴하고 亇知는 要妙하고 各히 其 妙를 得하얏다 한다. 그러나 亇知가 寄 中 獨步로 일반 士林간에 優待를 밧고 聖寵까지 입어서 樂典이 되엿섯다. 또 그와 동시에 樂典 金樂과 樂工 鄭玉도 역시 名手엿스며 樂妓중 명수로는 上林春이 可謂 萬綠叢中 一點紅으로 일반의 愛顧를 바덧섯다. 伽倻琴은 黃貴存, 金卜山이 當年 쌍벽이엿고 또 金召史라는 勞女子가 絶世 명수로 亇知 등이다. 先輩로 師事하얏스니 그는 元來 엇던 公侯家의 夫人으로 罪를 得하고 外方으로 謫居하야 그의 妙法을 外鄕에 만히 播傳하얏다 하며 당시에 盲人 鄭凡도 상당한 技藝가 잇서서 一世가 膾炙하얏섯다. 世宗朝에는 許吾繼, 李勝連, 徐益成이 또 저명하얏스니 勝連은 世宗에게 知遇하야 軍職에 拜하고 益成은 日本까지 琴師로 被聘하얏다가 日本에서 死하고 牙箏은 金都致가 명수엿스며 그보다 먼저는 金小材가 絶技엿스니 그 亦 日本에 가서 죽엇다 한다. 그 후 역대 樂壇의 名人物은 그 數가 또한 만허서 일일이 枚擧하기 不遑하거니와 현재 李王職雅樂隊 중에는 樂師長 明完璧 노인은 그의 이름이 完璧이니 만치 樂界에도 可謂 完壁이라 하겟는데 특히 歌曲과 伽倻琴에 능하고 樂師 咸和鎭君은 前 樂師長 咸在韻氏의 子로 一般樂에 다 능한 중 특히 玄琴에 더 능하고 그와 伯仲을 닷투는 金寧濟君은 伽倻琴이 명수엿다. 그리고 樂手 중 崔淳永君의 觱篥 李壽景君의 大笒, 朴德仁君의 笙簧, 劮�德秀君의 七玄琴, 明鎬振(明完璧子)君의 伽倻琴 朴昌均君의 大笒은 다 今世 獨步이다. 그리고 그들과는 다소 道不同한 점이 잇다 할지라도 현재 俗間에서 古樂界에 명성이 嘖嘖한 인물이 또한 만흐니 朴八卦, 深正淳의 伽倻琴은 기 技가 妙境에 달하야 可謂 今世 雙璧이라 하겟고 池龍九의 奚琴과 趙東奭의 短簫는 名手 중 名手로 능히 사람을 웃기고 능히 사람을 울리여 누구나 一聽 三歎을 禁치 못한다. 玄琴으로는 趙彛淳 리 洋琴에는 白溶鎭 노인이 大成이라 可謂 하겟고 金桂善의 長笛은 또한 今世의 獨步다. 올치 歌曲 대가로는 河奎一 노인이 제 1위를 占할 것이다. 그는 風流 老人으로 몸이 비록 花柳敎坊에 드러 잇스나 世世 歌曲大家로 雅樂隊의 明完璧 노인과 伯仲을 닷투는데 明씨도 역시 河奎一 노인의 父親 河俊權氏의 高弟이다. 此外 京鄕에 其名을 著한 인물이 또한 만흐나 후일 다른 기회로 밀고 이만 略한다. ＜157＞
