Korean Figures Known Internationally
						Suchun Hak-in

It was briefly introduced in another article that Prince Puru of Tangun went to the Dosan Confederation (塗山 萬國會), the strongman of the Blue Sea (滄海 力士) struck the carriage of Qin Shi Huang with an iron hammer, Ŭlchi Mundŏk destroyed 1 million Sui invaders, and Yang Manch’un shot the eye of Tang Emperor Yi Sěmin (李世民). There is no need to explain again that their high names shook all of China at that time, and Yŏn Gaesomun, the Moryŏji (莫離支) of Koguryŏ (Moryŏji was an official title, equivalent to Minister of War and Jungshuryeong (中書令) of Tang), was one of the three great military gods of Korea (along with him, Ŭlchi Mundŏk and Yi Sun-sin) who repeatedly defeated the Tang army, so that even children in Tang did not dare to cry at the mere mention of his name, and even during the reign of Emperor Shenzong of the Song Dynasty, Wang Gyeonggong praised him as an extraordinary figure. (His achievements are also omitted because they were published in the Ansi Battle article.) In Silla, Kim Yusin during the reign of King Muyŏl can be said to be the representative figure in Silla's 900 years. He allied with the Tang army to destroy the empires of Paekche and Koguryŏ, and then repelled the Tang army again to achieve the great task of Silla's unification, and thus his prestige was manifested in both internal and external countries, and at that time, the Tang general So Jŏngbang especially admired Kim Yusin and called him the Eastern Country Military Immortal (東國兵仙). Later, during the reign of King Sinmu, Chang Pogo was naturally generous and had extraordinary integrity, entered Tang and became a junior general in the Sŏju army, and after returning home, he became the ambassador of Ch’ŏnghae Garrison (now Wando) and, together with Kim Yang, defeated the Kim Myŏng rebels (Kim Myŏng assassinated King Hŭigang) and enthroned King Sinmu. Du Mu-ji of Tang compared him to Guo Fenyang, and Song Gi also regarded him as the same as Guo Fenyang. Another famous general in Tang at the same time was Chŏng Nyŏn. He was brave and strong enough to travel 50 li under the sea in one breath, and he always tested his courage and tactics with Chang Pogo and surpassed him. He entered Tang and became a junior general of the Munyŏng army, and he was good at riding and shooting, and his spearmanship was also divine, so no one dared to oppose him wherever he went, and after returning home, he once again joined Pogo in enthroning King Sinmu and achieved great success. During the reign of King Hyŏnjong of Koryŏ, Kang Kamch’an was the representative famous general in Koryŏ's 475 years, and his name was known even abroad. The Song envoy bowed to him and said that the star of honesty (廉貞星) had not been seen in China for a long time, but now it is in the East. His body was short and his clothes were tattered, and he was only a mediocre person in peacetime, but when faced with national affairs, he became a towering pillar and completely annihilated the 400,000-strong army of the Khitan at Kwiju. After becoming Prime Minister, King Hyŏnjong wrote a poem on the back of his patent, saying: "In the year of Gyŏngsul, there was Khitan dust, and the weapons deeply invaded the Han River. If Kang Gong's strategy had not been used at that time, the whole country would have been people with their robes buttoned on the left." Later famous generals who were famous abroad were Kim Hŭich’e, Pak So, Hwang Sang, Yi Bang-sil, and Ch’oe Yŏng. Ch’oe was the last famous general of Koryŏ, serving in the reign of King Kongmin, and he never lost in over 100 battles, large and small, and he was most meritorious in defeating the Japanese pirates, so the Japanese pirates warned each other that the most feared person in the world was Ch’oe Man-ho with his own hair (自髮 崔萬戶). Yi Bang-sil was also a contemporary person, and he was unmatched in bravery and made great contributions in the Red Turban rebellion, and Hwang Sang was also a contemporary person, and he was skilled in archery, and Emperor Sun of Yuan personally asked to see his arm. Pak So was a famous general during the reign of King Gojong, and he once became the military commander of Kwiju, defending against the Mongol invaders. The enemy attacked more than 100 times in 3 weeks, but was instead defeated by So. At that time, there was an old and brave general of over 70 years old in the Mongol army, and when he arrived under the castle, he looked at the castle walls and equipment and sighed, "Since I was a young soldier, I have seen all the castles in the world, but this is the first time I have seen a castle that can defend itself and not surrender even when it is surrounded and attacked like this. All the generals in the castle will surely become generals and ministers in the future," and he praised Pak So's martial arts and spirit, and even after returning to his country, he told everyone about Pak So's martial arts and spirit to warn them for the future. And at the same time as him, Kim Hŭich’e was a beautiful general like Ma Chao, and in addition to his intelligence and courage being unparalleled in the world, he also had literary talent. As the vice-envoy of the Northwest Frontier Army, he greatly defeated Kim Wŏnsu Yŏga-ha, and after becoming a general, he received the Mongol envoy and the Eastern Jin envoy by order of the king. The Eastern Jin envoy was also skilled in poetry. First, he sang a poem, saying, "The East Lord first reports warmth," and Hŭich’e immediately responded, "The Northern Emperor has already collected cold," and the guest envoy asked, "What do you mean by this phrase?" He replied without hesitation, "Since you sang with the intention of spring, I also harmonized with the affairs of spring," and the guest envoy admired him. After that, his literary and military reputation spread widely among the Mongols and Jurchens. During the Yi Dynasty, Yi Ch’ungmu-gong during the reign of King Sŏnjo and General Im Gyŏng-ŏp during the reign of King Injo would be representative famous generals who became known abroad. There are already many stories about them, and they are well known to the world, so I will not say anything new. During the Imjin War, General Kim Dŏngnyŏng's divine bravery was extraordinary, and when he was angry, firelight came out of his eyes, illuminating several li even in the dark night. His prestige was so great that even seeing the flag of General Ikhoryŏ (Winged Tiger General, 金의 稱號, Kim's nickname), the enemy fled in fear, and after he was wrongfully killed, the enemy even poured wine and congratulated each other. General Kwak Chae-u of the Red Robe was also admired as a famous general in both the Ming and Japanese dynasties at the time, but General Kwon Yul, who won the great victory at Haengju, was known by name to even the foot soldiers of both the Ming and Japanese dynasties. Oh, I almost forgot. Yi T’aejo and Tong Doulan both had great merits in the southern and northern expeditions, and Kim Jong-sŏ during the reign of King Sejong pioneered the Six Garrisons, and Sin Yu and Pyŏn Ŏl during the reign of King Injo defeated Rasŏn (now Russia), so it goes without saying that their high names were known even abroad.
The story of the famous generals was too long. Now let's talk about writing.

Writing! There are many people who have become known abroad for Korean writing, but among them, Hoya (蒿矢) would be the Choi Chiwon during the reign of Queen Jinsŏng of Silla. His name was Chiun (致雲), and his other name was Haeun (海雲) (from Saryang County). At the age of 12, he went to study in Tang, and at the age of 18, he passed the Tang civil service examination and served under Go Byeon (高騈) as a court inspector (侍御史). At that time, the rebellion of Hwang Chao broke out, and Byeon had to suppress it, so Chiwon wrote a proclamation to defeat Hwang Chao. His writing was so strict and bold that it could make ghosts cry and surprise people. In particular, when he reached the sentence "Not only do the people of the world all think of conspicuous execution, but also the ghosts in the earth have already discussed secret plots," even Hwang Chao, who was strong and unyielding, could not help but be greatly surprised and get out of bed. From that time on, his literary fame shook the world, and there was no one, even a street urchin, who did not know his name. At that time, Luo Yin, a famous poet of Tang, always relied on his talent and was so arrogant that he thought there was no one to match him in the world, and even looked down on Chiwon, but after seeing Chiwon's Five Laments (時五闃), he was so respectful and admiring that he could not even dare to suggest singing in harmony. Also, Gu Yun, who was the same age as Chiwon and was known for his writing, treated Chiwon as his older brother, and when Chiwon was about to return home (Chiwon was 28 years old at the time), he sent him off with a poem, saying, "I heard that there are three golden ao (金鰲) on the sea, and the heads of the golden ao carry high mountains. Above the mountains are pearl palaces and golden palaces, and below the mountains are thousands of miles of raging waves. Next to it is a small piece of blue Gyerim (鷄林), where the ao mountain gives birth to extraordinary beauty. Twelve ships crossed the sea, and their writing moved the Chinese nation. At eighteen, they roamed the literary world, and with one arrow, they pierced through the golden gate strategy," etc. His 46 collections in 1 volume and Gyewŏn Pilgyŏng (桂苑筆耕) in 20 volumes are all listed in the Art and Literature Records of the New Tang Dynasty, so you can see how much the Chinese admired his writing. At the same time as him, Ch’oe Ŏnhwi and Ch’oe Sŭng-u also had their literary names known in Tang. Ŏnhwi passed the Tang civil service examination as an 18-year-old boy and returned home, eventually reaching the position of Hanlin Academy Order (翰林院令) (all the palace courtyard titles of the Koryŏ Dynasty were written by him). Ch’oe Sŭng-u passed the Jinshi examination in the second year of Emperor Zhaozong of Tang and served Kyŏnhwŏn after returning home. The proclamation he sent to Taejo of Koryŏ on behalf of Kyŏnhwŏn is a magnificent piece of writing that is praised both inside and outside the country. (In brief, "The strong will win, the weak will lose, it is predictable. What is expected is to hang the bow on the floor of P'yŏngyang, drink horse in the water of P'ae River, to declare the plan of restoration and not regret..." )
<165>
Later, Pak Illyang, a native of Chukju, was famous as far as Song and Liao for his extremely elegant writing. When he was sent to Song in the Hŭinyŏng period, he arrived in Zhejiang. Zhejiang was originally famous for its treacherous waves, and there was a temple of Wu Zixu at the head of the river. According to legend, after Wu Zixu died unjustly, he became the so-called White Horse Tide, and anyone who passed under the temple without offering a sacrifice would find it difficult to pass because the tide would surge. When Pak Illyang passed by, the waves were also treacherous, making it impossible for ships to pass. He wrote a poem to mourn Wu Zixu's temple, saying, "Hanging eyes on the east gate, the hatred has not been locked, Zhejiang has been rising waves for thousands of years. Travelers do not know the meaning of the former sage, but only ask how many feet high the tide is." In a short time, the wind calmed down and the waves subsided, and the boat passed safely, so the people of the time praised that his poem was able to move the gods. Also, in the poem Guisan Temple in Saju, the line "The shadow of the pagoda falls into the river and turns the bottom of the river, and the sound of the cymbal shakes the moon and falls into the clouds" is a famous line that has been passed down throughout the generation. Later, Liao, following its prosperity, intended to expand its territory and make the area east of the Amnok River its national border, so he sent a petition to Liao on behalf of the country, saying in brief, "Since everything under the heavens is the king's land and the king's subjects, why must we say 'my territory' even in a small area? " and "Return the old fields of Wenyang to soothe the old villages, and return the clumsy sleeves of Changsa to dance in Changchen," etc., and the Lord of Liao was moved upon seeing it once and did not raise any further objections. Also, during the reign of King Yejong, Chŏng Jisang's poetry was extremely clear and beautiful, and <166> his talent and fame spread both inside and outside the country. Among his poems, the line "The rain has stopped, the grass on the long embankment is lush, and the sound of sad songs moves one to tears when sending you off at Nampo. When will the water of the Taedong River ever end? Tears of farewell are added year after year to make waves" from the Taedong River Parting Melody (大洞江 別調) is a masterpiece of the world that was selected for the Tang Poetry Selection and even rose to the status of Yuefu. At the same time as Chŏng Jisang, there was a family of four scholars whose literary fame was widely known both inside and outside the country. They were Kim Gŭn and his three sons, Buil, Busik, and Busu (also known as Bui). Gŭn was sent to Song together with Pak Illyang during the Song Hŭinyŏng period, and the Song people greatly admired his writings and published them, naming them Sohwajip (小華集). Bui's poetry and prose were bold and unrestrained, and he associated with the Jin envoy Han Bang as an envoy during the reign of King Sukjong. Bang was also a poet, and he sang dozens of poems, which Bui harmonized without any hesitation, and Bang admired him, saying, "Scholar Kim of the Eastern Country is truly an extraordinary person." Busik's writing made him famous throughout the world, and he was also a man of abundant appearance and large body with a dark face and exposed eyes, so he was an extraordinary man in the world. Therefore, the Song envoy Ro Yundik painted his portrait and reported it to his emperor, and the emperor ordered the department to carve it on a board and pass it down to the world, so his name was known throughout the world, and when he went to Song as an envoy, there were many people who watched him everywhere, and he was also treated with extreme courtesy. His works such as the Samguk Sagi (三國史), the Daegakguksa Monument (大覺國師碑), etc. are still praised by scholars both inside and outside the country. Yi Gyubo, the Baegung Gŏsa (白雲居士) during the reign of King Gojong, was the number one writer in the Eastern Country, and his high name was of course known both inside and outside the country. Among his poems, the two lines "The green mountains set in the shadow of a lame donkey, the red trees in autumn amid the sound of departing geese, where is the lone crane returning, the road is endless for the traveler" from the Roadside Monologue (路上口吟) are masterpieces that circulated in China, and scholars copied and cherished them. His 52-volume book (Yi Sang-guk Collection (李相國集)) is a rare masterpiece that is still enjoyed by scholars both inside and outside the country. At the end of Koryŏ, Mogŭn Yi Saek went to Yuan as a secretary and was promoted in the imperial examination. Hanlim Seungji Ouyang Xuan greatly praised Saek's countermeasure and promoted him to the second grade and awarded him the title of Hanlim Literary Official Jijege (翰林文字 知制誥) by imperial order, so his name shook China. During the Yi Dynasty, many writers were produced, and the number of them was very large, but to mention those who were especially famous abroad, Sŏ Sajong Gŏjŏng during the reign of King Sejo's name shook the Ming Dynasty. To give one example, when he was chanting poems with the Ming envoys Gi Sun and Jang Geun as a distant welcoming envoy, the two envoys admired his poetic talent and said, "You are a rare talent in the world. People like us can barely obtain one or two poems even after thinking about it all night, but you not only produce pearls and jade when you drop your pen while talking, but your calligraphy is also exquisite, so a person like you can roam the world," and during the reign of King Sŏnjo, Ch’oe Gojuk Gyŏngch’ang, in addition to being talented in both literature and martial arts, was skilled in music. During the Imjin War, he took refuge in Yŏngam, and when the Japanese soldiers suddenly arrived, he boarded a boat and fled. When the enemy surrounded him, Gyŏngch’ang played the Nostalgia Song (懷鄕曲) on his jade flute on a bright moonlit night, and the enemy listened to it and all wept and dispersed. The Ming envoys Ju Zhiban and Jian Yu obtained his poems and sighed, "We will go to Gangnam and spread this to show the prosperity of your country's culture." At the same time as him, Ch’oe Ganyui Yip was also in charge of the Gyooe Wŏn (槐院提調) and wrote many letters of diplomacy, and his words were bold, majestic, and righteous, and foreigners admired him greatly. And at that time, Cha Osan (whose name was Ch’ŏnno) was famous both inside and outside the country for his outstanding writing, which was the same as what was briefly introduced in the separate topic.

Next, the first person who became known abroad for his calligraphy was Kim Saeng of Silla. <167> He was a person from the time of King Wŏnsŏng of Silla, his name was Gu, and his alias was Jiseo. Throughout his life, he did not study anything else, but only calligraphy from an early age, and he did not put down his brush until he was over 80 years old. His clerical script and cursive script were all divine. Yang Gu and Yi Hyŏk, scholars of the Song Dynasty, said that apart from Wang Xizhi in the world, how could there be such a wonderful brush? The famous Yuan scholar Zhao Mengfu wrote a postscript on the Changnim Temple Stele (昌林寺碑), saying that the strokes were deeply typical and could not be surpassed even by famous Tang engravings, and the Yuan Emperor heard of his high name and sent an envoy to obtain his written scriptures. During the Koryŏ Dynasty, Kim Hyŏn (號 鐵村, 又號 鈍村), also known as Ch’ŏlch’on or Tunch’on, was famous during the reign of King Ch’ungsŏn. His clerical script was extraordinary, and he went to Yuan as a Sŭdok (侍讀) of King Ch’ungsŏn, and the Yuan people sought his clerical script so much that the price of paper in the Yuan capital soared for a time. During the Yi Dynasty, Han Sŏkpong Hwŏ was famous both inside and outside the country during the reign of King Sŏnjo. Wang Sejŏng of Ming (Yŏmjoo) praised his brushstrokes, saying that it was like a raging lion breaking stones and a thirsty horse running to a spring. And in modern times, Manhyangjae Ŏm Hanmyŏng (alias Do-hyang) was famous both inside and outside the country for his regular script. Emperor Yongzheng of Qing saw his Joseon Ja-mun (朝鮮咨文) and admired the exquisite calligraphy and sent him a red brocade when the envoy returned. Later, he personally summoned Hanmyŏng and wrote the signboard of Gyŏnghwamun (景化門) in three characters and hung it on the Gyŏnghwamun in T’aehwajŏn East. Gang Poam Sehwang praised his brushstrokes, saying that he was the only person after Sŏkpong who was majestic, deep, strong, and healthy. And the number of painters who became known abroad is also very large, but it will be introduced separately in another topic, so I will omit it here.

There are also many diplomats who have become famous internationally. Sŏ Wŏnsukgong Hŭi of Koryŏ, at the young age of 23, was sent to Song, and Emperor Taizu of Song was impressed by his personality and talent and made him Minister of War. Later, during the Khitan rebellion, he received a national letter and went to the camp of Khitan General So Sonnyŏng to ask for an audience, but Sonnyŏng said, "I am a noble of a great country, so I should bow down in the courtyard," but Hŭi replied, "It is polite for a subject to bow down to the king, but it is not polite for ministers of two countries to bow down to each other," and refused. Sonnyŏng repeatedly insisted, so Hŭi became greatly angry and returned to the embassy and lay down without getting up, so Sonnyŏng did not dare to do anything and invited him to the main hall again and greeted him with a bow. Sonnyŏng again said, "Your country has invaded the lands of Silla and Koguryŏ and communicates with Song across the sea, so we have mobilized our troops. If you cede land, we will withdraw our troops without incident," but Hŭi said, "Our country is the descendant of Koguryŏ, so we named it Koryŏ, so how can you say that we have invaded? Also, the area inside and outside the Amnok River is also our national border, and the Jurchens live in between, so we have to communicate across the sea for convenience of transportation, so it is the fault of the Jurchens and not Koryŏ's responsibility," and his words were full of spirit, so Sonnyŏng knew that he could not force it and finally withdrew his troops. At the end of Koryŏ, Jŏng Poeun Mongju was famous not only for his writing and morality but also for his diplomacy. He served as an envoy to Yuan, Ming, and Japan several times, and especially in Japan, his personality, theories, and writing were so admired that they never ceased to admire him. Later, after hearing the news of his martyrdom, some people even went to Buddhist temples to pray for his soul, and his <168> poems written during his missions are still recited by many people. During the Imjin War of King Sŏnjo of the Yi Dynasty, Samyŏng Daesa (surname Im, alias Songun) went to Japan as an envoy and negotiated with Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and his spirit was high and his words were clear, so Hideyoshi was greatly impressed and treated him like a god or Buddha. One day, Hideyoshi asked leisurely, "I heard that your country has many treasures, so what is the most precious treasure?" and Songun replied, "Our country does not consider anything to be a treasure, and we consider your head to be the most precious treasure," so Hideyoshi initially showed anger but then laughed greatly and treated him generously.
Shortly before the Imjin War, Hakbong Kim Sŏng-il was sent to Japan, and the Kanpaku wrote "Isgwan (是舘)" on the door of the embassy to test his knowledge and welcomed him, but he scolded angrily, saying, "Isgwan (是舘) means the lodging of the people below the sun (日下人) (the people below the sun are 是字, so it is said), how can there be such an insult to a state guest?" and the Kanpaku was greatly surprised and impressed. And his words that he described Hideyoshi's eyes as being like the eyes of a rat were famous at the time. Although his assertion that the Imjin War would not break out was a great mistake, it is true that he did not tarnish the dignity of the country as an envoy and demonstrated a dignified national mission, making his name known abroad. During the reign of King Sejo, Sin Sukju was also sent to both Ming and Japan, and both inside and outside the country were impressed by his literary and diplomatic skills that were superior to those of ordinary people. In addition, there are quite a few famous figures such as scholars, politicians, and craftsmen, but they are briefly mentioned in other articles, so I will omit them here. Also, there are figures such as Ch’oe Suun, the Daewongun, Chŏn Bongjun, Kim Okgyun, and Son Ŭiam in recent times, but their stories are well known to the general public, and in addition to them, there are not a few people in our Joseon who have done things that the world can know, but there are still circumstances that cannot be announced, so I will put down my pen here and wait for the next time.＜169＞

壇君의 太子 扶婁氏가 塗山 萬國會에 幸行하고 滄海 力士가 秦始皇의 수레를 鐵槌로 따려 바시며 乙支文德이 100만의 隋寇를 처서 업시하고 梁萬春이 唐太宗 李世民의 눈을 쏘은 것은 다른 기사에 잠깐 소개하얏다. 그 때 그들의 놉흔 이름이 支那 全土를 掀動한 것은 다시 설명할 필요도 업거니와 高句麗 莫離支 淵蓋蘇文은(莫離支는 官名이니 唐의 兵部尙書 兼 中書令과 如함) 朝鮮 3大軍神의 1人으로 (그와 乙支文德及李舜臣) 唐兵을 누차 격파하야 당시 唐나라의 아동들은 그의 이름만 한번 드러도 감히 울지를 못하고 후세 宋 神宗때에도 王荊公은 그를 비상한 인물이라고 찬양하얏다.(그의 事蹟도 安市戰 기사에 게재되엿기 略한다.) 新羅에 잇서서는 武列王때의 金庾信을 新羅 900년간에 대표적 인물이라 可謂 하겟는데 그는 唐兵과 연합하야 麗濟를 파멸한 후 다시 唐兵을 격퇴하야 新羅統一의 大業을 이르고 따러서 그의 威名이 內外國에 顯揚하얏섯는데 當時 唐將 蘇定方은 특히 金庾信을 敬慕하야 東國兵仙이라 稱하엿다. 그 뒤 神武王때에 張保皐는 天性이 磊落하고 奇節이 잇섯섯는데 唐에 드러가서 徐州軍 少將이 되엿고 귀국한 뒤에는 淸海鎭(今 莞島) 大使가 되야 金陽과 가티 金明賊(金明이 弑僖康王)을 討하고 神武王을 옹립하얏다. 唐의 杜牧之는 그를 郭汾陽에 比하고 宋祈도 또한 그를 郭汾陽과 동일하다고 하얏다. 그와 同時代에 名將으로 또 唐土에 저명한 이가 잇섯스니 그는 鄭年이다. 爲人이 勇壯하야 한숨에 海底 50리를 能行하는데 張保皐와 항상 그 勇力과 戰術을 試하야 其右에 出하얏다. 唐에 드러가 武寧軍 少將이 되매 騎射를 잘하고 槍法이 또한 神妙하야 향하는 곳마다 감히 敵하는 자가 업섯고 귀국 후에늊� 다시 保皐와 가티 神武王을 擁立하야 大功을 이르럿다. 高麗 顯宗때에 姜邯贊은 高麗 475년간에 대표적 名將으로 이름이 국외까지 振하얏스니 宋의 使臣은 그를 부고 拜하야 曰 廉貞星이 中國에 오래 뵈지 안터니 이저 東方에 잇섯다고 하얏다. 신체가 矮陋하고 의복이 람루하야 평소에 보면 中人에 불과한 國事에 臨하야는 屹然이 柱石이 되야 龜州에서 契丹의 40만 大軍을 全滅하얏다. 相國이 된 뒤에 顯宗王은 그의 告身의 後에 一絶을 手書하야 曰 庚戌年中有虜塵하니 干戈深入漢江濱이라. 當時不用姜公策이엇스면＜164＞ 擧國皆爲左衽人이라 하얏다. 그 뒤에 名將으로 국외에 저명한 이는 金希磾, 朴犀, 黃裳, 李芳實, 崔瑩 등이니 崔는 高麗 最後의 名將으로 恭愍朝에 仕하야 大小 100여戰에 한번도 패한 일이 업섯는데 그 중 倭寇를 討하는데 가장 有功하야 倭寇가 相戒하되 天下 所畏者는 自髮 崔萬戶라고 하얏다. 李芳實도 역시 同代의 人인데 驍勇이 無双하야 紅巾賊에 大功을 세우고 黃裳도 同時代人으로 射才가 能하야 元順帝가 親히 請하야 그의 팔을 본 일까지 잇섯다. 朴犀은 高宗때에 名將으로 일즉이 龜州 兵馬使가 되야 蒙古寇를 防禦하는데 敵이 來侵한 지 凡 3旬에 100計로 功하얏스나 反히 犀에게 大敗한 바 되엇섯다. 그 때 蒙古軍에는 70餘歲의 老猛將이 잇섯는데 城下에 이러러서 城壘와 器械 등을 바라보고는 歎息하야 曰 내가 少年 때부터 從軍하야 天下 城池를 두루 보앗스나 이와 가티 包圍 攻擊을 당하고도 能히 방어하며 降服치 안는 것은 처음 보왓다. 城 中의 諸將은 將來에 맛당이 다 將相이 되리라고 하고 稱頌하고 本國에 가서도 朴犀의 武藝와 氣槪를 일반에 말하야 후일을 戒하얏다. 그리고 그와 同時代에 金希磊�는 馬超와 가튼 美將軍으로 智勇이 天下 絶倫한 외에 文才를 겸하야 西北面 兵馬副使로 金元帥與哥下를 大破하고 大將이 되야서는 王命으로 蒙古使와 東晋使를 接應하는데 東晋使는 역시 詩에 能한 자이라. 먼저 시를 唱하야 曰 東君이 初報暖이라 하니 希磾 즉 和하되 北帝가 己收寒이라 한 즉 客使가 問하되 君이 何意로 此句를 賦하얏느냐고 하니 그는 서슴치 안코 대답하되 君이 春意로서 唱하기에 나도 또한 春事로 和하얏노라 하니 客使가 歎服하얏다. 그 뒤로는 그의 文武의 聲名이 蒙古, 女眞 등에 廣佈되엿다. 李朝에 잇서서는 대표적 명장으로 국외에 知名하게 된 이는 宣祖때의 李忠武公과 仁祖때의 林慶業將軍일 것이다. 그에 대한 이약이는 이미 발표한 적이 만코 또 세상에서 잘 아는 터이닛가 새삼스럽게 말치 안는다. 壬亂 때에 金德齡將軍은 神勇이 絶倫하야 怒한 즉 目中에 火光이 出하야 비록 暗夜라도 數 里를 照하얏다. 그의 威名이 엇지 굉장하엿던지 翼虎將軍(金의 稱號)의 旗만 보와도 敵이 望風逃走하고 그가 冤罪로 被死한 뒤에는 敵軍은 또 술을 부어가며 서로 賀醴까지 하얏다. 紅衣將軍 郭再祐도 당시 明日 兩國에서 다 名將으로 追崇하엿지마는 幸州大捷을 한 權慄將軍은 明日 兩國의 走卒까지 다 그 이름을 알엇섯다. 올치 이젓구나. 李太祖와 佟豆蘭이 南征北伐에 다 大功이 잇섯고 世宗때에 金宗瑞는 6鎭을 개척하고 仁祖때에 申劉와 邊岋은 羅禪(現 露國)을 격파하얏스니 그들의 高名이 다 국외에까지 놉흔 것은 물론이엿다.
명장에 대한 이약이가 너무 길엇다. 이제부터는 文章에 대한 이약이를 하자.

文章!  朝鮮의 文章으로 외국에 알너진 사람은 퍽 만치만은 그 중 蒿矢는 新羅 眞聖王 때의 崔致遠 先生일 것이다. 그의 字는 致雲 또 一字는 海雲이니(沙粱郡人) 12세 때에 일즉이 唐에 유학하야 18세에 唐科 及第를 하고 侍御史로서＜165＞ 高騈의 幕下에 잇섯섯는데 때마침 黃巢의 반란이 이러나 騈이 토벌하게 되매 致遠이 黃巢를 討하는 檄文을 지으니 文章이 嚴正豪邁하야 能히 鬼神을 울이고 사람을 놀나게 된 바 其中 「不惟天下之人이 皆思顯戮이라 抑亦地中之鬼가 已議陰謀라」한 句에 이르러서는 彼 强悍硬骨의 黃巢라도 大驚 下床함을 免치 못하얏다. 그 때로부터 그의 文名이 천하를 진동하야 비록 街童走卒이라도 그의 일름을 모르는 이가 업게 되엿다. 그 때 唐의 詩人으로 유명한 羅隱이 항상 자기의 才操를 밋고 自高하야 天下에는 짝할 사람이 업다고 自處하고 先生까지도 輕視하더니 先生의 時五闃을 보고는 敬歎 不已하야 그 후로는 감히 唱和하자는 말도 내지를 못하고 또 당시 文章으로 先生과 同年인 顧雲은 선생을 兄으로 事하야 그가 귀국함에 臨하야는(先生 時年 28) 詩로써 送別하되 略曰 『我聞海上三金鰲하니 金鰲頭載山高高라 山之上兮珠宮貝闕黃金殿이요 山之下兮千里萬里之洪濤라 傍邊一點鷄林碧하니 鰲山孕秀生奇特이라 十二乘船渡海來하니 文章感動中華國이라 十八橫行戰詞苑하니 一箭射破金門策이라 云云하얏다. 그의 著한 46集 1卷과 桂苑筆耕 20卷은 다 新唐書 藝文志에 게재되엿소니 그의 文章을 中國人이 여하히 追崇하엿는지 알 수 잇다. 그와 同時에 崔彦撝, 崔承祐도 文名이 역시 唐土에 뜰치 엿스니 彦撝는 18세 소년으로 唐科에 及第하야 歸國後 官이 翰林院令에 至하고(麗朝宮院額號가 다 그의  撰定한 바이다.) 崔承祐는 唐昭宗 2년에 進士에 登第하야 귀국 후 甄萱을 事하얏스니 그가 甄萱을 爲하야 麗太祖에게 送한 檄文은 內外가 다 膾炙하는 雄文이다.(略曰, 强嬴若此勝負可知, 所期者掛弓於平壤之樓, 飮馬於浿江之水, 宣迷復之爲計, 無後悔之自怡……)
그 뒤 朴寅亮은 竹州인으로 文詞가 극히 雅麗하야 宋과 遼에 까지 著名하얏다. 그가 熙寧年間에 宋에 使할새 이르니 浙江에 이르니 浙江은 원래 波濤가 험악하기로 유명하고 江頭에 俉子胥의 廟가 잇는데 俗轉에 伍子胥가 寃死한 후 所謂 白馬潮가 되야 누구던지 그 廟下를 지낼 때에 祭치 안이하면 그 潮波가 洶湧하야 잘 통행치 못한다 하는 곳이엿다. 그가 지낼 때에도 그 亦是 파도가 험악하야 선박을 통행치 못하게 되엿는데 그는 詩를 作하야 伍子胥廟에 吊하야 曰 掛眼東門恨未鎖하니 浙江千古起波濤라 遊人不識前賢意하고 但問潮頭幾尺高라 하니 잠간 새에 風靜浪息하야 舟가 安過함으로 때의 사람들이 稱하기를 그의 詩가 能히 神을 感動하얏다 하고 또 四洲 龜山寺 詩에 塔影倒江翻江底하고 磐聲搖月落雲間句는 天下 名句로 一世가 다 傳誦하얏다. 그 뒤에 遼가 왕성함을 따러서 영토를 확장할 야심으로 鴨綠江 以東까지 國界를 삼고자 하니 그는 國을 위하야 遼에 陳情表를 送하되 略曰 「普天之下가旣莫非王土王臣이니 尺地之餘에 何必曰我疆我里리요 하고 又曰歸汶陽之舊田하야 撫綏弊邑하고 回長沙之拙袖하야 *舞昌辰이라」云云하니 遼主가 한번 보고 感心하야 다시 異議를 두지 못하엿다. 또 睿宗때에 鄭知尙은 詩가 極히 淸麗하야＜166＞ 才名이 내외에 날이 녓는데 그의 詩 중 大洞江 別調「雨歇長堤草色多하니 送君南浦動悲歌라 大洞江水何時盡고別淚年年添作波라」의 句는 天下絶唱으로 唐詩選에 入選되고 또 樂府까지 올낫다. 鄭知尙과 同時에 1門 4夫子 文章으로 文名이 내외에 喧傳된 이가 잇스니 그는 金覲과 그의 3子 富佾. 富軾, 富輸(一名 富儀)이다. 覲은 宋熙寧 中에 朴寅亮과 가티 宋에 使하얏섯는데 宋人이 그 의 著述을 보고 극히 稱歎하야 此를 刊行하고 小華集이라 名하얏스며 富儀는 詩文이 豪逸하야 肅宗朝에 接伴使로 金使韓昉과 交遊하는데 昉도 또한 能詩의 人으로 數十篇의 시를 唱하되 그가 小豪도 滯思가 업시 和唱하니 昉이 歎服하야 曰 東國 金學士는 眞異人이라 하얏고 富軾은 文章이 一世를 鳴하는 외에 爲人이 豐貌 碩體로 面黑目露하야 天下 奇丈夫인 故로 宋使 路允迪이 그의 肖像을 畵하야 其帝에게 歸奏하니 帝가 司局에 命하야 板에 삭여서 世에傳하
니 그의 일름이 天下에 傳하야 그 뒤에 使臣으로 宋에 가매 到處마다 觀望하는 자가 甚多하고 또한 極禮로 待하엿다. 그의 著한 三國史大覺國師碑 등은 尙今까지 내외국의 학자들이 다 稱揚한다. 高宗때의 白雲居士 李奎報는 東國 文章중 弟1人으로 그의 高名이 내외에 알녀진 것은 물론이다. 그의 詩 중에 路上口吟「蹇驢影裏碧山暮, 斷鴈聲中紅樹秋, 獨鶴何歸天杳杳, 行人不盡路悠悠」二句는 絶世佳作으로 中國에 流轉하야 사대부들이 互相傳誦하고 엇던 사람은 畵簇까지 맹기러 두고 보왓섯다. 그의 著書 52卷(李相國集)은 稀世의 大傑作으로 내외 학자가 지금까지 膾煮한다. 麗末에 牧隱 李穡은 書狀官으로 元에 至하야 制科에 擢하얏는데 翰林承旨 歐陽玄이 穡의 對策을 보고 크게 稱賞하야 遂히 제2甲으로 擢하고 勅命으로 翰林文字 知制誥를 授하니 이름이 中國에 振動하얏다. 李朝에는 文章이 輩出하야 그 數가 심히 마흐나 특히 外國까지 이름난 사람을 말하자면 世祖때에 徐四佳居正은 이름이 明國에 振動하얏스니 其中 1例를 말하면 그가 遠接使로 明使 祈順, 張瑾 등과 酬唱할 때에 兩使가 그의 詩才에 歎服하야 曰 公은 天下 奇才로다. 吾輩와 가튼 者는 終夜토록 생각하야도 僅히 1, 2편을 得할 뿐이나 公은 立談하는 間에 筆을 落하면 珠玉을 이를 뿐 안이라 筆法이 또한 妙하니 公과 가튼 이는 可히 天下를 橫行하겟다고 하얏스며 宣祖때에 崔孤竹 慶昌은 文武의 才를 겸한 외에 音樂에 능하야 壬亂에 靈岩에 避居하엿더니 倭兵이 猝至함으로 배를 타고 逃避하니 敵이 包圍함으로 慶昌이 달 밝은 밤을 타서 玉蕭로 懷鄕曲을 朗吹하니 敵이 듯고 다 感泣散去하얏섯다. 明使 朱之蕃과 簡齵가 그의 詩를 得하고 歎하야 曰 江南에 돊�라가서 이것을 傳布하야 貴國 문물의 盛한 것을 彰하겟다 하얏다. 그와 同時代 崔簡易岦도 槐院提調로 잇서서 交隣의 文字를 만히 製述한 바 辭意가 雄豪明正하야 外國人의 感歎한 바 만헛섯다. 그리고 그때 車五山(諱天輅) 公이 盖世文章으로 盛名이 內外國에 날인 것은 別題에 잠깐 紹介한 것과 갓다.

次에 名筆로 국외에 알녀진 사람은 新羅의 金生이 맨 먼저일＜167＞ 것이다. 그는 新羅 元聖王 때 사람으로 이름은 玖요 字는 地瑞니 평생에 다른 공부는 하지 안코 어러서부터 오즉 글시 공부만 하야 80여세가 되도록 손에 붓을 놋치 안엇섯는데 그의 隷書와 行草는 다 神에 入하얏다. 宋나라 學士 楊球와 李革은 말하되 天下에 王右軍을 除하고야 엇지 이러한 妙筆이 잇겟느냐고 讚揚하고 元나라 名筆로 有名한 學士 趙孟頫는 昌林寺碑에 跋하야 曰하되 字劃이 深히 典型이 잇서서 비록 唐人의 名刻이라도 能히 지나치지 못한다 하고 元帝는 그의 高名을 듯고 使者를 보내서 그의 쓴 經書를 구하야 갓다. 高麗朝에 忠宣王때에 金晅(號 鐵村, 又號 鈍村)이라 하는 니가 유명하얏스니 그는 隷書가 絶特하야 忠宣王의 侍讀으로 元에 가 잇섯는데 元人이 그의 隷書를 만히 구하야 감으로 元都의 紙價가 一時 高騰하얏다 한다. 李朝에는 宣祖때에 韓石峰濩이 내외에 이름이 뜰치엿스니 明의 王世貞(弇州)이 그의 筆勢를 評하야 曰 怒猊가 石을 決하고 그의 渴驥가 泉에 奔함과 갓다 하얏다. 그리고 近代에는 晩香 齋嚴漢明(字道鄕)이 楷書로 내외에 著名하얏스니 淸의 雍正帝는 그의 쓴 朝鮮咨文을 보고 그 書法의 精妙한 것을 歎賞하야 使行이 도라올 때에 漢明에게 특히 紅錦 1匹을 賜送하얏고 그 뒤에는 漢明을 親히 召하야 景化門 三字의 門額을 써서 太和展東 景化門에 揭하얏는데 姜豹庵世晃은 그의 筆法을 贊하야 曰 하되 雄沈 勁健함이 石峰 後 1人이라 하얏다. 그리고 畵家로 이름이 외국에 알녀진 사람은 그 數가 또한 만흐나 別題에 따로 紹介되여기로 여긔에는 略한다.

외교관으로도 國際에 이름난 인물이 만흐니 高麗 成宗때의 徐元肅公熙는 23세의 靑年으로 宋國에 使하얏는데 宋 太祖가 그의 人格과 才藝에 感服하야 兵部尙書를 식히고 그 뒤 또 契丹亂 때에 國書를 밧들고 契丹장군 蕭遜寧의 營에 가서 相見의 禮를 問하는데 遜寧이 말하기를 我는 大國 貴人이니 맛당이 庭下에서 拜하라 하니 熙가 對하야 曰 臣下가 君에게 下拜는 禮로되 兩國 大臣이 서로 보는데 下拜하는 것은 禮가 안이라고 拒絶하니 遜寧이 再三 强請함으로 熙가 크게 怒하야 使館으로 도라가서 눕고 이러나지 아니하니 遜寧이 敢히 엇지 하지 못하고 다시 堂上으로 請하야 揖禮로 相見하얏다. 遜寧은 다시 말하되 귀국이 新羅, 高句麗의 땅을 侵蝕하고 바다를 건너서 宋과 交通함으로 이와가튼 動兵을 하얏슨 즉 만일에 토지를 割讓하야 주면 무사이 撤兵하겟다 하니 熙왈 我國은 곳 高句麗의 後인故로 高麗라 명한 바이니 엇지 侵蝕하얏다 하리요. 且 鴨綠內外는 또한 우리의 國境으로서 女眞이 其間에 據하야 變詐無双함으로 交通의 便利上 不得己 바다를 건너서 交通하게 된 것이니 그것은 女眞의 탓이요 高麗의 關係할 바 안이라 하고 辭氣가 慷慨하니 遜寧이 무리하게 못할 것을 알고 遂히 罷兵하얏다. 麗末 鄭圃隱夢周는 文章 道德 외에 外交로 또한 著名하얏스니 그가 元나라로 明나라로 日本으로 屢次 奉使하얏섯는데 특히 日本에서는 그의 人格과 理論, 文章 등에 感服하야 稱慕함을 마지 안이하던 바 其後 그의 節死한 소문을 듯고 佛堂에 가서 그의 冥福을 비른 사람까지 잇섯고 그의＜168＞ 使行 중에 지은 詩는 지금까지도 傳頌하는 者가 만타. 李朝 宣祖 壬亂때에 四溟大事(성은 任, 자는 松雲)는 日本에 使하야 豐臣秀吉과 芪�할세 意氣가 軒昻하고 言辭가 明白하야 秀吉이 크게 感服하야 待遇하기를 神佛과 가티 하얏다. 一日은 秀吉이 從容이 問하되 貴國에 珍寶가 만타하니 何物이 가장 寶物이냐 한 즉 松雲은 대답하되 我國은 별로 寶物로 넉이는 것이 업고 너의 머리를 最上 寶物로 안다 하니 秀吉이 初에는 怒色이 잇다가 다시 크게 웃고 厚히 待하얏다.
壬亂이 이러나기 얼마 前하야 鶴峯 金誠一이 日本에 使하얏섯는데 關伯은 氏의 識見을 試驗하기 위하야 使館門額에 是舘이라 쓰고 그를 迎接하니 그가 怒叱하야 曰 是舘은 日下人館을 意味함이니(日下人은 즉 是字 故로 云) 國賓에 대하야 그런 侮辱이 어듸 잇느냐 하니 關伯이 大驚歎服하얏다. 그리고 그가 秀吉의 눈을 評하되 鼠目太와 갓다 한 말은 당시 유명한 이약이엿다. 그가 壬亂의 不起한 것을 주장한 것은 아주 잘못이라 할지나 使臣으로서 國家의 체면을 더럽히지 안코 당당한 國家使命을 발휘하야 해외에 이름을 날인 것은 사실이다. 世祖때에는 申叔舟가 또한 明日 양국에 使하야 그의 文學과 交際手腕이 凡人에 卓越한 것을 내외가 다 感服하얏섯다. 此外에 學者, 政治家, 工藝家 등의 著名한 人物도 상당히 잇스나 다른 記事에 略載되얏기 여긔에 省略하고 且 近代에도 崔水雲, 大院君, 全奉準, 金玉均, 孫義庵선생 가튼 인물이 잇스나 그들의 일은 일반이 다 잘 아는 터이며 그 외에도 近來에 우리 朝鮮 사람으로서 세계가 다 알만한 일을 한 니가 적지 안치만은 아즉 발표치 못할 사정이 잇기에 이만 擱筆하고 다음 時期를 기다리랴 한다.＜169＞
