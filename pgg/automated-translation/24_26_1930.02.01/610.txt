Thoughts on Korean Folk Songs
An Chasan

『I』

Folk songs, also commonly referred to as *pungyo* (風謠, folk songs) or *sokyo* (俗謠, popular songs), possess a simple charm when compared to other songs. They are the origin of music and the foundation of literature. According to ancient interpretations, in Korean poetry (韓詩), verses are used, and those with verses are songs (*ka* 歌), while those without verses are ballads (*yo* 謠). The *Erya* states that *toga* (徒歌), which is unaccompanied singing, is *yo*. Both of these explanations are reasonable. To put it more appropriately, *yo* refers to non-artistic, popular folk songs that originated as the root of pure emotional poetry. These songs were not written down but relied on the power of music to survive.

Therefore, the origin of folk songs lies in genuine human beings expressing their natural observations and emotions objectively through oral tradition. The material found within does not involve elaborate embellishments but truthfully portrays the innocent and pure emotional life. Thus, folk songs are an expression of the emotional life of the people, revealing the collective sentiment of the populace without pretense.

『II』

Generally, folk songs were not originally transmitted through written records. Therefore, it is self-evident that the lyrics were not preserved. Consequently, it would be audacious to attempt to discuss ancient folk songs today. However, upon examining the collected works of ancient scholars, one often discovers that popular songs prevalent during the author's time were translated into Chinese poetry (漢詩). The *陶隱集*, *止止堂集*, *嘯皐集*, and especially *耳溪集*, contain over forty *Bukse Jabyo* (北塞雜謠, Miscellaneous Ballads from the Northern Frontier), which are valuable references as they are collections of Hamgyeong-do folk songs. I already published some research on this topic three years ago in *藝文* issues 1 and 2 of the 18th year, and I have continued to study it since then. While it is still difficult to make a definitive statement, by examining the materials I have gathered so far and investigating their inner workings, I believe I can roughly discern their origins.

The traces of their origin are evident in two aspects. First, they arise from a sense of natural life. Humans inherently possess musical rhythms in their speech. When ideas sparked by daily interactions with objects are combined with speech patterns and expressed outwardly, they become songs and music. The ideas emerging from these objects are expressed even in the various occupations people pursue, such as animal husbandry in the mountains, fishing along the coast, and the respective materials used in agriculture, crafts, and commerce.

*Jeonga Yo* (田家謠, Farming Family Song)
In the second month, the farming family hears the cuckoo cry,
The mud thaws, and there is no clod of earth that can be plowed.
The old man holds the plow with strong sinews,
The farmer's wife wears a hempen shirt with no complete skirt.
The spring ears gradually turn yellow, and the rice is newly green,
Neighbors meet and say nothing different.
Farming is both joyful and pitiable,
Waiting for a good year to discuss marriage.
The customs of farming families are truly genuine,
With grass already in their sleeves, returning to the fields, writing poetry.

*Sagajip* (四佳集, Collection of Four Good Things)
South village, north village, new rain is sufficient,
At the head of the field, the sound of scolding as they drive the calves.
Big children, small children walk and follow,
At noon, the wild lunch is fragrant with water celery and bracken.
Full of new silk, flying snow white,
Strive to be diligent in the work of farming.
For ten years, there has not been a great harvest,
Carrying jugs and meat, drunken eyes together.
Not like those who monopolize and fight for profit,
Who will know me when competing for seats in the future?

*Gacheon Jukjijeok* (伽川竹枝曲, Gacheon Bamboo Branch Song)
A lone boat floats on the river,
This body is more pitiable than a bird.
Waking up, opening the window, storing worries, standing,
The wind moves, and a faint fragrance comes to embrace the nose.

*Jijidangjip* (止止堂集, Collection of Jijidang)
Flying and singing, with faith, two sand swallows,
Leaning alone on the sparse window, the moon is hooked again.
A single cold plum tree announces the return of spring,
I suspect the lover has sent a brocade bag.

Thus, folk songs emerge in various forms. The content describing emotions sincerely reveals natural sentiments. There are sorrowful songs lamenting the hardships of life and peaceful and playful songs celebrating the blessings of nature. Second, they arise from worldly emotions. Human activities are greatly influenced by the changes of the times and communal actions, leading to numerous emotional impulses. Popular songs arising from these circumstances possess intellectual elements, and the subject matter is also quite significant. Their nature naturally includes both joy and sorrow, and their texts may be original creations that become popular for a time. These are often valuable materials for understanding public sentiment and the spirit of the times.

*Sanjung Yo* (山中謠, Mountain Song)
I heard of pirates in the sea,
Who initially landed at night.
In the middle, they grew arrogant and did not retreat,
Gradually daring to fight against the government troops.
At that time, I felt like I was hearing about events in another world,
But in recent years, the hills and valleys have suddenly changed places.
Barefoot, I climbed up a thousand-foot cliff,
The government troops burned the ships, provoking their anger.
The daughters in their rooms and the soldiers,
I was fortunate to hide in the thickets,
Enduring hunger and hardship day after day,
Crying out injustice for thirty-one years.
How can this happen to me today?
Thinking about it conversely, I appreciate my life.
Heaven is neither generous nor stingy to people,
Perhaps the gift of peace is near.

*Mogeunjip* (牧隱集, Collection of Mogeun)
Attacking the water village from time to time,
Thieves climbing over the walls,
Walking in broad daylight on the plains,
In the early morning, drumming and clamoring, suddenly at dusk.
Sleeping early, waking late, playing with grandchildren,
The power of the rebels is rampant, about to swallow everything.
Vines, thorns, stone corners, flying monkeys and apes,
Rampant poison fires burn everything together.
Heads joined, beheaded, what remains to be said?
Barely preserving life, nothing left behind.
Only now do I realize that many cry out injustice along the coast,
The court has long worried about the common people. <145>
Telling them, I want to push open the heavenly gate,
Long peace will surely lead to danger, prosperity to stagnation.
Although there is duration and speed, their grace is equal.
Now I bow my head and call to heaven and earth.

*Hoya Ga* (呼耶歌, Hoya Song)
Hoya, hoya, in the north and south,
A thousand people carry one log.
The stones of Hwasan are almost completely removed,
If the stones are gone and the mountain is bald, what can be feared?
The people are pitiable, who can recognize the wicked officials,
Not eating in the morning, not eating in the evening,
Still singing "hoya," the mouth is dry,
Voice weak, strength exhausted, collapsing stiffly.
I wish that heaven would create great timber,
To make the pillar of my grand mansion,
Not for the suffering of the people.

*Cheocheonjip* (樗軒集, Collection of Cheocheon)
When will the sound of "hoya" cease?
One out of ten thousand turns one stone,
How many bald trees of Baekun,
Filling pits and collapsing valleys, the people are pitiable.
Beating and urging like lightning strikes,
Pitiable empty bags hanging at the waist,
Mouth dry, throat hoarse, voice difficult to make,
Dust flying, blood splashing, one in ten thousand feet,
Not placing in the mountains and forests, placing beside the ruler,
Not laboring the strength of the people,
Do not make the "hoya" in the valleys.

*Mokgung* (木弓, Wooden Bow)
Wooden bow, reed arrow,
Narrow sleeves, felt hat,
Alas, my borderland child,
If you can be selected as a person to ride skillfully.

*Eohyejip* (耳溪集, Collection of Eohye)
Beside the river, practicing archery,
Long seesaw, riding a horse,
Work hard, don't be lazy,
Nothing is impossible for the powerful officials.

Popular songs that emerge spontaneously are sometimes spread everywhere through the unconscious mouths of children. The authorities tend to view the prevalence of these children's songs as mystical omens of good or bad fortune. The *Dongyo Jip* (童謠集, Collection of Children's Songs) in the *Munheon Bigo* (文獻備考, Reference Compilation on Korean History), Volume 11, is an example of this.

『III』

What arises in the first aspect is what circulates among the common people, with some disappearing and others being transmitted, lacking particular artistic value. What arises in the second aspect is often adopted by the music world and becomes artistic melodies. Ancient music often incorporated folk songs from the countryside. Silla music includes:

Naeji (內知) - Ilseongun Ak (日上郡樂, Music of Ilseong County)
Baeksil (白實) - Geollyanggun Ak (坤梁郡樂, Music of Geollyang County)
Deoksa Nae (德思內) - Haseogun Ak (河西郡樂, Music of Haseo County)
Seoknam Sa Nae (石南思內) - Dongbeolgun Ak (同伐郡樂, Music of Dongbeol County)
Sajung (祀中) - Bukgwi Ak (北隈郡樂, Music of Bukgwi County)

These became Silla court music, and their origin was that they were songs made for the enjoyment of the people in the villages. (Refer to *Samguk Sagi*, Volume 32) What was inherited to Goryeo as Goguryeo songs were:
Jeongyang (定陽) - a work by the people of Yeonseonbu (延山府).

What were Baekje songs were:
Mudeungsan (無等山) - a song of the people of Gwangju (光州).

What were Goryeo songs:
Yangju (楊州) - a song of the people of Hanyangbu (漢陽府). <146>
Jangdan (長湍) - a song of the people of Jangdan.
Sarhwa (沙里花) - lamenting the excessive taxation of the people.
Songsan (松山) - a song of the people of Songsan.

These songs were originally folk songs of the people in the countryside, becoming famous melodies in the music world, possessing excellent value. Therefore, the ancient perception of folk songs involved three aspects: first, viewing them mystically; second, considering them crude sounds; and third, regarding them as the product of genuine emotion.

『IV』

Today, folk songs are flourishing, and the academic world values and explores them, resulting in magazines readily publishing folk songs from the countryside and ordinary banquets regularly featuring the singing of folk songs. It seems that there are three reasons for the current development of folk songs. First, the public sentiment of the era is turbulent, and people do not know how to appreciate refined entertainment. Furthermore, music and literature have traditionally been specialized, making them generally inaccessible to the public. Therefore, they have no choice but to adopt the songs and music that they have self-sufficiently enjoyed in the villages. New intellectuals have little knowledge of past art and are inclined to adopt new ideas while discarding the old. Due to these various circumstances, folk songs have become very popular. Second, with the influx of naturalism and egalitarianism, public sentiment is trending towards these ideas, viewing formality and high-class matters as artificial, false, or oppressive. Therefore, there is sympathy for the straightforward, genuine, and ordinary, leading people to indulge in creating and enjoying folk songs that are common to the common people. Third, there is a heartfelt appreciation for folk songs arising from a love of one's own culture. In the past, literature was entirely dominated by Chinese characters, and works in Korean were often self-deprecating and abandoned, leading to the perception that Koreans were a people without literature. Looking back at historical records, one cannot help but feel resentment towards Chinese characters. In the *Goryeosa Akji* (高麗史 樂志, Music Records of the History of Goryeo), it is clearly stated that works in Korean were disregarded as vulgar, and in the 19th year of King Seongjong's *Seongjong Sillok* (成宗實錄, Annals of King Seongjong), Yi Se-jwa (李世佐) wrote:
"Using vulgar language in front of the assembled officials at the Imperial Hall, what kind of matter is this... Now, the female entertainers are accustomed to their old habits, abandoning proper music and indulging in lewd music, which is very inappropriate. Please prohibit the learning of all vulgar language."
The decline of Korean literature and music today is due to the addiction to Chinese characters. Therefore, it is appropriate for us to value the literature that embodies the spirit of our nation. As a result of this sentiment becoming unified across the nation, the prominence of folk songs has greatly increased.

That is so. We may redeem ourselves from being slaves to Chinese characters in the long run, and in creating a new culture, collecting folk songs is the most urgent way to understand the popular sentiment. Furthermore, recent artists tend to look down on old literature due to the habits of former scholars of Chinese classics, focusing only on new literature and assimilating into foreign literary styles. To fundamentally rectify these issues, one must thoroughly examine folk songs. Therefore, I do not refuse the task of studying and examining folk songs. However, rather than speaking with such emotions, I want to examine the value of folk songs academically with a detached attitude.

『V』 <147>

Overall, how many folk songs are currently circulating? If we include all the various similarities and differences, we cannot determine the limit, but even if we only grasp the main categories, they would not be limited to a hundred. (Lee Sang-jun (李尙俊)'s publication contains their musical scores, and his contribution is significant.)
*Nongbu Taryeong* (농부타령, Farmer's Song), *Banga Taryeong* (방아타령, Grinding Song), *Jang Taryeong* (장타령, Market Song), *Heung Taryeong* (흥타령, Joyful Song)
*San Taryeong* (산타령, Mountain Song), *Mul Taryeong* (물타령, Water Song), *Gae Taryeong* (개타령, Dog Song), *Sae Taryeong* (새타령, Bird Song)

are all commonly heard. First, I want to know what the 接尾 名詞, suffix 打令 of *Taryeong* (타령) means. Because those who have discussed folk songs are rare and there are no detailed vocabularies, it is difficult to know its origin and its source. There is a musical section called *Taryeong* in the *Yeongsan Hwesang Gok* (영산회상곡, Spiritual Gathering Music), but it is too superficial to use it as evidence here. However, it is easy to guess that it is related to the name of the musical piece. Therefore, gradually looking back at the music theories of the ancients, *Zhuzi Yulei* (朱子語類, Classified Conversations of Master Zhu), Volume 93, says:
"The Tang people call their folk dances *Daling* (打令). Their forms are fourfold: inviting, shaking, sending. The first is not recorded, but 'inviting' means the intention of stimulating, 'shaking' means shaking hands and calling, 'sending' means the intention of sending wine, etc."
In addition, this statement is also written in the *Gyeongse Daegun* (經世大訓, Great Compendium of Governance). Based on this record of Zhu Xi (朱熹), it is clear that *Taryeong* is the name of a folk dance song of the Tang people. Therefore, the origin of *Taryeong* is likely that when the Tang Dynasty's dance music was imported during the Dengnae (登內) of Goryeo, its name was also imported along with the music.

Next, regarding the form of folk songs, the numerical rhythm of the melody is always in four-four time, with eight characters composing one phrase. This four-four time is the original pattern and basic structure of ancient songs, reflecting the natural rhythm of breathing and repeating the natural emphasis. This is the purest original color of folk songs. The style of the writing is in two types: one is a long piece, and the other adds a refrain to create a "chorus," which is for social singing and response. This refrain contains subtle couplets and extraordinary metaphors, but it is common to use interjections repetitively, which is a primitive method of embellishment and creates a natural development.

『VI』

Third, from the perspective of poetic ideas, the inner workings of general folk songs are centered on entertainment. Therefore, there is an abundance of romantic affairs and playful banter between men and women. At first glance, this may seem to suggest a licentious and unrestrained folk custom. However, the truth is different. The people have no desires and seek self-comfort by taking advantage of the leisure of natural life, which is where this expression arises.
Fourth, what is the musical expression, that is, the tone of folk songs like? This commonly carries a tone of sadness, the reason for which was explained in the previous episode (Byeolgeongon, previous issue). In other words, the sadness is largely due to the influence of Buddhism, but if we further analyze the crystallization of this sadness, it also contains elements of the oppressed reflection of class politics. Originally, court music was for glory and desire, praising the merits of the founding ancestors (such as *Yongbieocheonga* (龍飛御天歌, Songs of the Dragons Flying to Heaven)) and adorning the solemnity for their own prestige, formally and morally binding the music. However, the lower classes were subjugated for thousands of years, unable to aspire to upward development, and their silently engraved, instinctive antagonism was expressed unconsciously, which manifested in the general tone. These reasons should not be superficially dismissed.

Because of this, there is not a single word or phrase about patriotism in Korean folk songs. Italian songs are similar, but Korea has even less to show for the reasons mentioned above. Of course, there are other factors, but the pretext of class politics is an important factor. As new and old cultures alternate, folk songs are also gaining new momentum, and the explosion of emotions in layers is creating a time to produce new folk songs. The editors of *Gaebyeoksa* (開闢社, Creation Company) are putting in effort to pay attention to this, having already collected over a thousand old folk songs and integrating them into new research, so I expect their contribution to be significant in the future. <148>

朝鮮 民謠의 時數
						安自山
『一』

민요라 하는 것은 風謠 또는 俗謠라고도 통칭하는 것이니 민요를 他歌에 견주면 순박한 풍미가 잇는 것으로서 음악의 始根이오 문학의 址臺라. 古人의 界說에 의하면 韓詩 章句에는 써 하되 章句 잇는 者를 歌 章句 업는 者를 謠라 하고 爾雅에는 徒歌 즉 樂器로 伴奏치 안는 것을 謠라 하엿다. 此 兩隻의 說이 다 무방한 짐작인대 다시 적절히 말해 보면 謠라 하는 것은 非藝術한 민간 俗套의 歌로서 純情詩의 始根으로 발생한 것이니 이는 특히 문자로 題記치 안코 음악의 力을 資賴하야 비로소 생명을 잇게 된 것이라.
그런즉 민요의 발생은 眞局한 인간에서 인생의 天然的한 관찰과 감정을 口頭에 藉하야 객관적으로 吐泄한 것일 새 여긔 잇는 재료는 奇巧한 治裝을 내지 안코 天眞爛熳의 情生活을 眞率로 寫出한 것이라. 그러매 민요는 국민생활의 情表로서 인민 전체의 심성을 가식 업시 表顯한 것이니라.

『二』

대체 민요는 本是부터 文蹟으로 傳屬함이 업는 것이라. 고로 그 歌詞의 遺傳되지 못함은 不言可知라. 고로 금일에 안저서 고대의 민요를 論難하기는 壯히 未擧한 일이라 할지라. 然이나 古人의 文集을 査實하면 其中에 著者當代에 유행하든 속요를 漢詩로 譯作하야 둔 것이 종종 들켜나니 陶隱集 止止堂集 嘯皐集 더욱 耳溪集 가튼 데에 잇는 北塞雜謠 사십여 편은 함경도 민요를 수집한 바 귀한 참고거리가 된다. 나는 이믜 삼 년 전에 藝文 18년 1號 2號에 就하야 약간 연구를 발표한 일이 잇섯고 其後에도 連放 講磨해본 일 잇는지라 아직까지도 투철한 了定을 지어 말을 하기 難堪하나 旣往 收聚한＜144＞ 재료를 가지고 其 內脉을 推究하야 보면 대강 其 苗脉을 攄得할지라.
그 발생한 흔적은 二方面으로 보인다. 一은 자연의 生活感으로 나온 것이라. 吾人은 口音 중에 樂律이 自在한대 일상 사물에 접촉하야 발동하는 관념을 口調에 合하야 外에 발휘하면 그게 즉 歌謠音樂이 되는지라. 그런데 其 사물에 끼아처 나오는 관념은 各其 營營逐逐하는 노동에조차 발현하니 즉 산중에는 목축생활 해변에는 漁泳生活 農, 工, 商 등 각기 생업에 의하야 其 재료를 삼은지라.

田家謠
田家二月啼布穀
泥融無塊田可耕
老翁秉耒筋力强
家婦布衫無完裳
春穗漸黃稻新綠
里閭相逢無異說
稼穡可樂還可憐
待得有年議婚姻
田家家家風俗眞
袖中己草歸田詩

四佳集
南村北村雨新足
原頭叱叱驅犢聲
大兒小兒行跟蹡
日午野餉芹蕨香
滿眼新繰飛雪白
勗爾辛勤事稼穡
十年不見大有年
携壺挈肉相醉眼
不比壟斷爭利人
他時爭席知我誰

伽川竹枝曲
江上孤舟一葉浮
此身堪嘆不如鳥
睡起開窓貯愁立
風動暗香來擁鼻

止止堂集
飛鳴有信兩沙*
獨倚疏欞月再鉤
寒梅一樹報春回
却疑郞君錦囊來

그러틋 민요는 형형색색으로 비저나다. 그 정서를 묘사한 내용은 천연한 성정을 진솔로 攄破할 새 潛然히 인생의 고초를 탄식하는 悲曲도 잇스며 冷然히 자연의 은총을 희열하는 平和調 戱曲도 잇더라. 二는 世情感으로 나온 것이라. 인간의 활동은 시세의 변천과 공동 行色에 의하야 충동적 감회가 許多히 나오니 此 事情에 인하야 발생한 속요는 智力的 分子가 잇스며 사실의 표제가 또한 不少하다. 其 性質은 물론 喜悲가 俱存할지오 其 文章은 或者의 창작으로서 일시에 유행함도 잇나니 이런 것은 民志와 時代的의 재료됨이 多般이라.

山中謠
我聞海中賊
其初夜登岸
中焉驕不退
漸與官軍敢相敵
我時如聞異世事
年來陵谷忽易處
赤足走上千仞崖
官軍燒船激其怒
閨中女兒與卒徒
我幸竄伏榛灌中
忍飢忍苦日復日
呼寃三十又一年
奈何今日亦及我
反而思之賞我命
天於人兮無厚薄
賜之太平或者近

牧隱集
時時攻水村
鼠竊踰墻垣
白晝行平原
淸晨鼔譟俄黃昏
寢早起遲弄兒孫
賊勢猖獗將倂呑
藤棘石角飛猴猿
肆毒烈火如俱焚
聯首就戮餘何言
僅保性命無留存
始知濱海多呼寃＜145＞
廟堂久矣憂黎元
告焉直欲排天閽
久安必危亨必屯
雖有久速均其恩
我今稽顙呼乾坤

呼耶歌
呼耶呼耶在南北
千人輸一木
華山之石拔幾盡
石盡山禿寧可虞
民可惜誰能識惡卒,
朝未食夕未飡
猶唱呼耶口吻燥
聲衰力盡一僵仆
我願天公生大材
作我堂堂大厦之柱石
不爲萬姓瘼

樗軒集
呼耶之聲何時息
萬一轉一石
白雲之木斫幾禿
塡坑仆谷民可惜
捶督如電擊
可憐腰間空垂橐
口燥喉嗄聲難作
塵飛濺血萬一足
不置山林置君側
不勞萬姓力
莫使呼耶在山谷

木弓
木弓兮蘆矢
狹袖兮氈笠
嗟我邊城兒
若得選人親騎術

耳溪集
江邊兮習射
長楸兮走馬
努力莫少惰
萬戶權官無不可

일시적으로 나온 속요는 혹간 兒童輩의 無意識한 口頭로 도처에 傳播됨도 잇는지라 이런 동요의 유행됨에 대하야는 위정자의 환상으로는 엇던 길흉의 신비적 符徵으로 관측함이 一手니 文獻備考 卷十一에 잇는 童謠集이 그런 例套러라.

『三』

그런데 第一方面으로 발생한 것은 민속간에 유행하다가 七零八落으로 或亡 或傳한 바 예술상 가치가 別樣 업는 것이오 第二方面으로 나온 것은 樂壇에 채용되야 藝術化한 곡조가 만흐니 古昔의 음악이란 것은 居之半 향촌의 민요를 채용한 것이라. 신라 음악으로는

內知        日上郡樂

白實        坤梁郡樂

德思內      河西郡樂

石南思內    同伐郡樂

祀中        北隈郡樂


이것들은 신라 宮中樂이 된 바 其本은 鄕人喜樂之所曲作이라 한 것이라.(삼국사기 제32 참조) 高句麗歌로 고려에 遺傳된 것은
定陽         延山府人의 作

가튼 것이오 백제 것은
無等山       光州民의 謠

가튼 것이오 고려 것은
楊州         漢陽府民의 歌

長湍         長湍民의 歌＜146＞

定山         定山民의 歌

沙里花       인민이 賦稅의 過함을 寃呼한 것

松山         松山民의 歌

등 諸歌曲은 본시 향촌 인민의 속요로서 樂界의 명곡으로 되야 훌늉한 가치가 잇든 것이러라. 그런즉 고대인의 민요에 대한 관념은 三條가 잇스니 一은 신비적으로 보는 것, 二는 野鄙한 聲調로 보는 것, 三은 眞情의 所出로 치는 것이라.

『四』

금일에 잇서는 민요가 盛豊히 유행하며 학계에서는 그를 중요시하야 염탐하는 時色이 심하나니 고로 잡지 등에는 뻔이떠케 鄕曲의 俗歌를 게재하며 일반 연회의 여흥에는 謠曲을 唱함이 恒茶飯이라. 觀컨대 금일의 민요 발달의 源因은 三條의 눈치가 뵈는 듯하다. 一은 시대적 민심이 擾亂하야 고상한 오락을 취할 줄 모른다. 加于에 음악 문학은 自來로 전문적이든 것인바 일반 사회에서는 보통으로 알 수 업든 길이라. 고로 오직 촌락에서 자급자족하야 스스로 興行하든 歌樂을 취할 밧게 업스며 신진인사는 前日의 예술에는 聞見이 업서 巽方이 되매 더퍼노코 改舊革新의 사상이 잇는지라 그런 여러 가지 사정으로 인하야 민요가 왓작 盛行한 것이라. 二는 자연주의와 평등사상이 겻드려 수입되는 바람에 인심은 모도 그리로 趨向되야 체면과 高等의 事는 도트러 假飾 虛僞 또는 壓迫的으로 對視하는지라. 고로 順直이오 本心이오 평범한 것을 同情하매 文學 及 歌樂도 서민 공통의 謠曲을 만드려 耽翫하는 모양이라. 三은 愛本心으로 우러나와 민요를 貴愛하는 時色이 잇다. 前日의 문학이란 것은 전혀 한문을 爲主하고 정작 朝鮮語 朝鮮文으로 된 것은 自鄙自棄하야 고만 無文學의 민족이 되엿는지라. 年來 史籍을 들처볼진대 한문에 對隻하는 讐仇¿ƒ이 안이 날 수 업다. 高麗史 樂志에 보면 朝鮮語로 된 것은 鄙俚타 하야 말살한 글발이 두렷하며 成宗 實錄 19年條 李世佐의 上啓에도
御正殿臨群臣時用俚語於事體何如... 今妓工狃於積習舍正樂而好淫樂甚爲未便一應俚語請皆勿習
라 하얏스니 금일 조선문학 조선음악이 衰殘한 것은 彼 한문의 중독이라. 是以로 吾人은 我 民族의 本精神 되는 문학을 爲重함이 可하다. 이런 사상은 擧民族 일치로 되는 결과 민요의 聲勢는 크게 발흥하게 된지라.
따는 그러하다. 우리는 日久月深에 매처 잇는 漢文奴를 贖良도 할지오 新文化를 開創함에 就하야 因勢上으로 民風을 廉探하기는 歌謠를 收取함이 가장 緊할지라. 더욱 近者의 文藝家는 前日 漢學者 버릇으로 舊文學을 蔑視하고 新文만 爲主하야 덧읍시 外國 文套에 동화하야 가는 爻象이라. 이것들을 근본적으로 頓整하자면 未嘗不 민요를 詳審함이 單罷榜이라 할지라. 그래서 나도 민요를 講考하는 生意를 마지 안이하는 바라. 그러나 余는 時方 그런 感情的을 품고 말하는 것보다 거시키 冷情한 태도로써 연구를 시험하야 민요의 가치를 학술적으로 엿보고자 하는 바라.

『五』＜147＞

대관절 현행하는 민요의 수효는 얼마나 되나뇨. 各色의 雜同散異를 모도 몰면 限量을 못 차리되 大頭腦만 잡드라도 一端 百의 數로만 되지 안는다. (其 曲譜는 李尙俊 氏의 發行이 잇스매 其 李氏의 功은 多大하다 하노라.)
농부타령        방아타령        장타령        흥타령

산타령          물타령          개타령        새타령

등은 아모라도 일상 熟聞하는 게라. 그런데 于先 其 接尾 名詞인 打令 二字가 무엇인지 이것을 알고 십다. 自來 歌謠를 論講한 者이 희소하고 昭詳한 어휘가 업슴으로 其 語源과 其 出處를 알기가 索莫하다. 거시키 靈山會相曲이란 樂曲에 타령이란 樂節이 잇지마는 여긔다가 證據대기는 너무 淺近하다. 그러나 이것이 樂曲名과 관계됨은 이로써 짐작키 용이하다. 고로 次漸次漸 古人의 樂說을 뒤저보면 朱子 語類 卷九十三
唐人俗舞謂之打令其狀有四曰招曰搖曰送其一紀不得盖招則激之意搖則搖手呼喚之意送者送酒之意云云
라 하고 그 뿐 外라 經世大訓에도 亦如是 이 말이 적혀 잇스니 이 朱熹의 기록에 憑準하면 타령은 즉 唐人 民俗의 舞蹈曲名이 분명하다. 고로 타령의 유래는 필시 고려 登內에 唐의 舞樂을 만히 수입하든 次 其時에 음악과 眼同하야 其 名詞까지 수입된 듯 짐작하노라.
於其次에 민요의 형식을 말할진대 音調의 數律은 매양 四四調로서 八字를 一句로 구성한지라 이 四四調는 古來 歌詩의 元套 丹骨로 쓴 것이니 그의 그 투는 생리상 호흡의 맥박을 準的하야 自然한 强弱을 되푸리 繰返한 것이니 이것이 제일 순수하게 나온 민요의 本色이라 할지라. 文章의 體裁는 二種으로 되니 一은 長篇으로 된 것이오 他一을 後廉을 入하야 「코러쓰」를 作하니 이는 社交的 唱和로 된 것이라. 이 後廉은 미묘한 對句와 奇絶한 比喩도 잇스되 매양 感動詞를 反復的으로 用함이 통례니 이는 원시적 修飾法으로서 自然한 발달을 作한 것이러라.

『六』

第三次 詩想으로 볼진대 일반 민요의 內脈은 娛樂的으로 中心하다. 고로 남녀의 情事 戱弄의 才談 등이 車載斗量이라. 이는 얼핏 짐작하면 淫蕩放逸의 民風이 잇게시리 보인다. 그러나 其實은 딴판이니 인민은 아모 利慾 업시 자연생활의 여가를 乘하야 自樂的 安慰를 求함에서 발생한 口氣라 하노라.
第四次로 音樂的 表白 즉 민요의 聲調는 엇더하뇨. 이는 通히 悲哀의 韻을 띄여 잇는 바 그 이유는 去番에(別乾坤 前前番號) 說破한 것이라. 즉 悲哀調된 裏許는 대체 불교의 영향으로 된 것이라 하얏스되 한 번 다시 그 悲哀調의 結晶을 分釋하면 계급정치의 被壓迫되던 反影의 分子도 비벼 잇는지라. 본래 宮廷音樂은 榮慾的으로 되매 先王의 建國해 준 功德을 讚頌하고(龍飛御天歌類) 자기의 威信을 위하야 장엄함을 治裝하야 음악을 形式的 又 道德的으로 團束햇지만은 下民은 천 년간 굴복하야 向上發達을 피치 못하매 黙새긴 白活 本能的한 反感이 不言之中에 發動하야 그것이 일반 音調에 골아 나으니 이런 이유는 참말로 歇后하게 칠 것이 안이라 하는 바로다.
이 때문에 조선민요에는 愛國에 관한 語調라곤 一言半句가 업다. 伊太利 歌謠도 그러치만 조선은 上에 말한 이유로 인하야 더욱 볼 것 업다. 물론 딴 관계도 잇지만은 계급정치의 빌미가 중요한 頉이러라. 時方 新舊文化가 갈마드는 틈에 잇서 민요도 新氣運이 나스겟고 더욱 層生疊出한 감정의 폭발은 새 민요를 産出할 要代가 된지라. 玆에 開闢社 編輯子는 工力을 드려 이것을 注意할 새 벌서 천여 편의 舊民謠를 수집하야 新硏究에 滲着한다 하니 將次 그의 功獻이 적지 안이할 줄로 짐작하노라.＜148＞
