When spring comes to Jindalnae (진달내),  

the dear one comes.  

Even after spring has gone,  

you still do not come.  

In every petal of the azalea,  

are thoughts of longing.  

In every petal of the azalea,  

is the pain of meeting.  

On the peaceful shore, the mountain lighthouse,  

overshadowed by the rocky outcrop,  

a single azalea blooms,  

swaying gently.  

Knowing that spring will pass and you will not come,  

I understand it well, yet still,  

losing myself in hope for ten years,  

I am unable to forget.  

**Summary**  

This poem contemplates the passage of spring and the longing for a beloved who does not return. The imagery of the azalea symbolizes beauty alongside sorrow, capturing a common theme in Korean poetry of love and nature entwined. From the perspective of Korean colonial history, the poet's sense of longing and heartache may reflect the broader sentiment of loss and yearning experienced by Koreans during Japanese rule, making it a poignant reminder of cultural identity and emotional resilience during turbulent times.

진달내꼿
						劉道順
진달내의 봄이되면
오신다든님
진달내의 봄이가도
안이오시네
진달내꼿 필적마다
그립은생각
진달내꼿 질적마다
매치는설음

녕변에도 약산등대
야즈라진바위
한송이의 진달내꼿
간들거리네
봄만가고 안올줄은
뻔이알면서
속아속아 십년에도
닛지못하네<5>
