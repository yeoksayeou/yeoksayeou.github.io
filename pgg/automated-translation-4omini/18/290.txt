A New Light for the Disabled, the Deaf and Mute Can Also Speak  
Kim Dong-sik  
Alas. I too am one of the deaf-mutes, and I cannot hold back my tears of sympathy for the deaf-mutes across the world. Therefore, I wish to speak of my experiences and at the same time, to save those who are suffering like me from the sea of sufferings.  

Dear friends. Why were we born as unfortunate deaf-mutes who cannot hear or speak? I am a sorrowful 24-year-old deaf-mute. In my childhood, unable to communicate with others, I was deprived of education and could not even write due to my lack of hearing; consequently, I could not convey my feelings to anyone, including my parents and siblings, leaving me in a state of daily despair.  

Time flows swiftly like water, and before I knew it, I was around ten years old. My grandfather, having cultivated considerable knowledge, realized that I could not continue without education, and so he began teaching me classical Chinese day and night. It has now been eight years, and I have been fortunate enough to learn simple writing, which has allowed me to communicate with others, albeit with difficulties. I could not help but envy the happiness of children who usually attend school.  

At that time, a friend visited me and explained that there was a department for the blind and deaf at the Jesaengwon (濟生院) in Gyeongseong. I danced with joy and immediately asked my father for permission to enroll at the blind and deaf school, which he readily granted. I enrolled at the Jesaengwon's department for the blind and deaf, graduated after four years, and later graduated from the higher department of the Tokyo School for the Deaf and Mute in Japan. I am now delighted that I can communicate through writing.  

However, I regret that there are no institutions in Korea for the employment of the deaf-mute society. If deaf-mutes do not receive education, when they need to visit a doctor, report theft, or when they have to deal with the police or courts, they cannot fully express their true situations to others during these critical times. The pain and distress suffered by the mute person and their family in these circumstances are truly hard to express in words, making the situation indeed pitiful and sad.  

I believe that there are many who have regretted not enrolling in school due to their age. Regardless of the issues surrounding language, it is very convenient to express one’s true situation, yet our unfortunate deaf-mute peers cannot hear voices or produce words, making it exceedingly difficult for them to achieve their happiness. If they receive sufficient education, they might be able to gain the convenience of writing.  

Blind people cannot see the form and color of objects, but they say listening is convenient. However, that too must come with its own doubts, as the blind mutes are equally unfortunate. Therefore, my hopes for all of you are to quickly enroll in a deaf-mute school and receive the teaching methods for deaf-mute education, such as "expressions," to awaken knowledge in any way. You should strive to maintain silence and work hard to become proficient in writing so that you do not have to endure ridicule from others.  

Mr. Park Du-sung, a teacher at the Jesaengwon's department for the blind and deaf, has dedicated 16 long years of service since the establishment of the school in the first year of Taisho (大正元年) to express sympathy for the blind and deaf. He has put effort into the educational curriculum for blind students using Braille and has achieved significant results, thereby becoming the true pioneer of Braille education in Korean language. Furthermore, he has poured his heart into teaching the deaf and mute sign language and pronunciation research, and the results of his efforts have been great. The graduates honor his favor deeply, engraving it in their bones and will never forget.  

I express my sympathy for the Korean deaf and mute education field and the general society, and I wish to share the feelings of solidarity with my fellow sufferers. Upon returning home last year, I immediately visited and greeted Mr. Park Du-sung, a teacher at the department for the blind and deaf in Jesaengwon.  

According to the investigation carried out by the Home Bureau of the Korean Governor-General's Office, the current statistics on deaf-mutes of Korean descent are as follows:  
Male - 7,272  
Female - 3,032  

When enrolling at Jesaengwon, those who are economically stable must pay for their own education fees amounting to over nine won a month, while those in poverty receive a stipend that only provides for meals.  

1. Duration of study - Blind 3 years  
- Deaf 6 years  

1. The locations of blind and deaf schools in Korea are as follows:  
Gyeongseong = government-run, established by the Korean Governor-General in 1911.  
Pyeongyang = private, established by a westerner (American) in 1903.  

1. Enrollment period is every April.  
1. Enrollment qualifications = ages ranging from 8 to 20.  

With this reference, I sincerely hope that all unfortunate friends around the world can seek a new light.

The above is the original manuscript that Kim Dong-sik brought when he visited our department. Thus, it is published with no edits. He is from Kaesong and is capable of writing, and is currently working on establishing a printing factory solely for deaf-mutes. (Reporter) <81>  

**Summary**  

This article reflects on the experiences of Kim Dong-sik, a deaf-mute who overcame his challenges through education at specialized institutions. It emphasizes the difficulties faced by the deaf-mute community in Korea, particularly the lack of vocational opportunities and the dire consequences of not being able to express oneself in critical situations. The piece highlights the importance of education in empowering the disabled, particularly during a time of colonial rule where such issues were often marginalized. Historians might find it revealing of the societal attitudes towards disability, as well as the efforts made by individuals to improve the conditions for the disabled during a period of oppression.

不具者에게도 새로운 光明, 聾者도 啞者도 듯고 말할 수 잇다
						金東湜
嗚呼라. 필자도 聾啞의 一人인 바 滿天下 聾啞에 대하야 同情의 淚를 금치 못하노라. 고로 자기의 經歷한 바를 말하고저 하며 동시에 同病者를 苦海에서 救코저 하노라.
諸君이여. 何故로 不聞不言의 불행한 聾啞로 탄생되엿는가. 필자는 當年 24세의 可憐한 聾啞이다. 幼年時代에는 타인에 대하야 通話도 불능하고 聽覺이 無한 中, 교육을 受치 못하야 筆談도 불능하엿스니 타인의게는 물론 부모형제자매에게도 情을 通치 못하야 心腸이 破裂되는 듯 비참한 時가 매일 幾次式 되엿다. 세월은 流水와 如히 速하야 어언간 10여歲가 되매 祖父는 상당한 지식을 함양하야 주지 안이하면 不可한줄로 覺悟하시고  晝宵로 漢文을 敎授하시기를 于今 八箇星霜에 至한 바 如干 容易한 筆談은 不難하야 타인과 情을 叙할만한 편리를 得하엿스니 불행중 다행이다. 他幸福의 아동이 보통학교에 통학하는 것을 見하면 欽羨함을 不禁하엿다.  其時에 親友가 필자를 尋訪하야 京城에 濟生院盲啞部가 有함을 설명하여 주엇다. 필자는 手舞足蹈하면서 부친께 盲啞學校에 입학을 청하엿드니 즉시 허락을 하심으로 京城府 西大門外의 濟生院盲啞部에 입학하야 4년 修了하고 再次 일본에 東京聾啞學校高等部를 졸업하야 지금은 타인과 如何한 筆談이든지 용이함을 歡喜한다. 然이나 조선에서는 聾啞社會를 위하야 如何한 직업에 취직할 기관이 無함을 유감으로 아는 바요, 만일 聾啞者로써 교육을 不受하면, 의사의게 진찰을 受하든지 도난을 당할 時나 혹은 경찰서에 如何한 관계가 有하든지 裁判等이 有할 時에라도 實情을 타인의게 충분히 호소치 못하니 其 곤란과 실패를 感하는 啞 本人과 其親族의 心痛은 형언키 難하니 실로 가련하고 한심하다. 旣히 年齡이 多하야 학교에 입학치 못하고 후회하는 同病者도 不少할 줄노 信한다. 言語에 如何한 事情이든지 實情을 발표하는 편리가 有하거늘 불행한 우리 聾啞者 諸君은 음성도 不聞하고 言語도 不發하야 자유의 신체가 不自由하게 되니 如何히 하야 자기의 행복을 得할가. 상당한 敎育을 授하야 筆談의 便을 得하지 하니하면 不可한 줄노 信한다. 又 盲人은 物의 形色을 不見하나 音聲을 聞함이 편리하다 하겟지만 그것도 疑念이 深할 것이니 盲啞는 同樣의 不幸者다. 然則 諸君의게 희망하는 것은 一日이라도 속히 聾啞學校에 입학하야 聾啞敎育上 敎授方法의 『形容』을 受하야 何에든지 지식을 啓發하기 위하야 沈黙을 守하고 修養에 노력할지며 타인의 嘲笑을 受치 안이하도록 필담이 능통하도록 학문에 勉勵하라. 濟生院盲啞部 在職중인 朴斗星先生은 該校 設立 當時 즉 大正元年으로 在來 16星霜의 長久한 세월을 斯道에 盡瘁하야 盲啞의게 同情을 表하기 위하야 盲人敎育의 點字考案에 盡力하야 多大한 效力을 得하엿스니 실로 朝鮮文의 盲人 點子敎育의 始祖가 되며 且 聾啞者에게는 指文字의 공부 손흉내, 발음의 연구 등에 심혈을 注하야 斯道의 良果를 擧하니 其卒業生은 朴先生의 은혜를 骨髓에 刻하야 不忘하는 바라 필자는 朝鮮聾啞敎育界및 一般社會에 대하야 同情을 표하는 동시에 同病者相憐의 感을 叙하기 위하야 昨年에 귀국 즉시로 濟生院盲啞部 敎諭 朴斗星先生을 訪問하야 인사를 드렷다.

朝鮮總督府 內務局에서 조사한 바에 의하면 현재 朝鮮人側 聾啞者 統計는 左와 如하다.
男-7,272명
女-3,032명
濟生院盲啞部에 입학할 時는 有力者는 自費로 一箇月 九圓餘를 要하며 貧困者는 給費로 식사만 공급해준다.
1. 修業年限-盲科 3개년
-啞科 6개년
1. 朝鮮內 盲啞學校소재지는 左와 如함.
京城=관립, 조선총독부 1911년 창립.
平壤=사립, 서양인(미국인) 1903년 창립.
1. 입학기한은 매년 4월.
1. 입학자격= 연령 8세 이상, 20세 이내.
右記를 叅照하야 滿天下 不幸同友 여러분이 새로운 光明을 구하기를 거거듭 거듭 바란다.

이상은 金東湜君이 本社를 來訪할 때 써 가지고 온  原稿인 故로 특히 添削을 加하지 안코 그대로 揭載한 것이며 君은 開城人으로 筆談에 能하며 方今聾啞人만의 印刷工場 設立을 周旋중이다.(記者)<81>
