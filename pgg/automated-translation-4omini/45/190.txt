This text is an essay from a mad person. It is written just as thoughts occurred, directly put onto the manuscript paper. There is no particular skill involved. However, there might not even be an aspect that seems plausible. Dear readers, please read this text until the end while observing how confused and deluded the author’s mental state is, as that will serve as a valuable reference. The author is a patient in the psychiatric ward of a university hospital, writing these essays and poems daily, dressed in a pink robe and with a bang on their head. (Refer to the West Seven Room Visit Records.)

“One life, pure and clean measure  
Two lives, south side, obtaining the azure dragon  
Three lives, west side, seeking a pure land, all shamans sing”  
As for the Je-seok-pul (고불, 께 고불), it states  
“Wife, wife, daughter-in-law coming down from the ancestors, coming down, reciting Buddha, coming down. Is it wearing a bang, or is it wearing a shaved head? Is it being vegetarian because of monasticism? Now, let us play joyously.”  

A few days ago, during a farewell event, conversations that are not common emerged. Words flowed smoothly and elegantly, not from usual guests, bowing deeply to the father’s seat. Emphasizing the engagement contract of two parents in the corridor, the father’s other name was Bak Chusi. Suddenly, while bidding farewell, the gentleman at the stairs disappeared. At the time of the Year of the Fire Rooster (丙子), Bak's family produced a remarkable hand, his chest bearing the marks of a blue crane, a white crane, a yellow crane, with cries of distress.

It is said my family is extraordinary—intelligent and talented, yet they despise standing still, unwilling to learn. I yearn for alcohol, losing my stamina, unable to hear ordinary speech during conversations. When I was seven, I met with smallpox; my respected parents wept as they held me tightly, tears flowed uncontrollably. The Buddha’s energy gathered on the Diamond Mountain and was not lost in the two times the parents returned. My heart, like an arrow, attached to the Diamond Mountain.  

The Jade Emperor, Buddha guests, and the light of the Buddha came down to meet the light of the Buddha, and later, he descended for the third time. They did not know the two people were in paradise on earth, and my heart rejoiced upon meeting the Tathāgata (如來). Silly and unaware, my hopes rested on the divine general, whose danger arose as a concern at a time of urgent inquiry.

I asked my elder sister: “What is my surname?” to which she replied, “My father was once bamboo.” I declared that I could be bamboo as a father and wood as a mother. Thus, from the start, my parents were designated to be bamboo and wood, and they never left my side. For over thirty years, I had been the emperor, only praying to God himself for goodwill and infinite blessings for all. The heaven opened, granting me, and I wished to repay heaven’s grace and hoped to achieve nine benefits in life. Looking back, I reflect on the bamboo writings from the past.

Before my father descended to be an emperor, he gave birth to eight daughters. My respected parents did not know I was the first son. I fervently wish for the birth of children, nine, all of them daughters. Abandoning a crow seeking protection in my deep jade box, I hope not to face death. In this life, I descend as heavenly hibiscus, born in the early Han as Wang Zhao-jun. (The rest is omitted.)  

  

**Summary**  

The essay presents the thoughts of a psychiatric patient, using vivid imagery and a fragmented narrative style that reflects a tumultuous mental state. The author integrates personal experiences and philosophical musings, touching on familial relations and various beliefs. The fascination lies in the contrasting elements of traditional belief systems and existential reflections amid colonized Korea's societal context. Historians might find interest in how mental health was perceived during this era and the cultural narratives shaped by colonial influences.
