京城七名士 新年運數判斷記  
						李萬台  
What is the fortune this New Year? There is no craftsman who can predict it, especially through divination; it is difficult to uncover. Knowing this, I have chosen a few scholars to prophesy this year's fortune, specifically consulting Mr. Lee Wan-tae (李萬台), who claims to be ‘fifty-seven years old’ and has studied at Geumgyeongsan for ten years. 

Whether they are correct or not will be seen. In any case, by revealing their fortunes, I believe it will provide an engaging narrative to the esteemed readers! If those mentioned here could send a small bottle of wine as a token of appreciation...

 

Song Jin-woo  

Born in the year of Gyeong-in on the eighth day of the fifth month in the hour of the Dragon, the divination is summarized as follows:  
On the pillow for a moment, spring dreams cause no trouble. In the second and third months, there is nothing more. The door omens are not good. 

Brother Gyeong, beware! The shepherd's flute is silent. There is much fortune in motion. For wealth, the outward direction is auspicious; you are strong, and wealth is plentiful.  
The command of the gold wind makes fortune flow freely. There is much receiving from wealth, but be cautious of the south direction; the southern wind is vigorous.  

Fortune and misfortune are half and half. On the moonlit night at Dongting, embracing the jade plum, seeking profit is most auspicious. 

In the first and second months, additional mouths will bring in wealth. Both east and west are highly auspicious; the north is not favorable for business. The gold and water are most auspicious, offering guests at the door; accumulating good deeds brings good fortune; this year is favorable, particularly in autumn and winter.

 

An Jae-hong  

Born in the year of Sin-myo on the thirtieth day of the twelfth month in the hour of the Monkey, the divination is summarized as follows:  
The sun rises in the beautiful jade hill, heaven and earth are bright. In the northwest, the land and river are flowing like fortune paths; beware though of water and fire. 

There is harm within good. The wood is vigorous, and the southern wind in autumn causes self-harm. In the months of April, May, and June, handling a thousand pieces of gold... 

Inside, adding a mouth, and outside gaining unexpected wealth. The gold wind of winter brings fortune and misfortune hand in hand. 

At home, the heart is troubled; in the bright day of winter, the fortune of one's life is free-flowing, and it's beautiful to have a fortune span of three years.

 

Kim Seong-su  

Born in the year of Sin-myo on the ninth day of the ninth month in the hour of the Ox, the divination is summarized as follows:  
This year, it is advisable not to aspire far. Though one is in good health, old woes remain. The wood is vigorous, and the eastern wind blooms. 

In sacred deeds, there is no virtue; the household is in motion. Troubled thoughts arise with the peach blossoms blooming. Do not head to the apricot village. 

Gold and wood conflict; there may be talk related to financial matters. In business dealings, wait until metal is prosperous. In the months of July, August, and September, benefactors will arrive to help, and in the east, there will be harm. In winter, there will be a fortune: handling a thousand pieces of gold.

Avoid misfortune. The moonlight shines on the body, a person’s fortune will face adversity first then lead to good luck.  

 

Lee Gwang-su  

Born in the year of Gyeong-jin on the first day of the second month in the hour of the Dragon, the divination is summarized as follows:  
This year the fortune is half good and half bad. There may be personal calamities; inquire medicine from the southern direction. In business undertakings, it is suitable to have earthy possessions during the second and third months.  

Financial matters will go as one wishes; if not, there will be losses among relatives. Ask their surnames: Kim and Park. In the months of April, May, and June, there will be glory everywhere, but no benefit at home.  

Going out will bring good fortune. Though it is said that way, it is like a tiger in the deep forest. In August and September, the financial fortune flows freely. However, in the middle of the affairs, gossip may be formed.  

In winter, one is strong, and wealth increases; this year's fortune is bright and luminous.  

 

Lee In  

Born in the year of Byeong-sin on the twentieth day of the ninth month in the hour of the Dog, the divination is summarized as follows:  
This year’s fortune carries two truths: one is for wealth, another for the joy of children. The wood is vigorous, and the eastern wind prevails.  

There are benefits found in undertakings; the gold surname harms me. The west is not auspicious during the months of April, May, and June, while one’s health is good, and wealth is plentiful.  

Great wood meets the rain, just the time to prosper. In the months of July, August, and September, there will be visits from benefactors, and how fortunate will that be!  

It is not marriage but wealth involved during the auspicious floral river land. The enduring mind shines brightly, and the business matters, water and earth are both required.  

Seeking a house reveals a wall; a person's fortune does not hinder. There may be thoughts of moving. The northeast is very auspicious, and this year’s fortune has more good than bad occurrences.  

 

Park Hee-do  

Born in the year of Gyeo-chuk on the eleventh day of the eighth month in the hour of the Rooster, the divination is summarized as follows:  
Heaven's auspicious clouds descend, and happiness is everywhere. In performance, there is fortune. Not at home, if there are no additional mouths, will it cause a loss.  

In the months of spring, a child may be born. The fire is vigorous, and the southern wind prevails. Wealth will flow freely in the months of July, August, and September; how wonderful it would be if a blind man finds a cane!  

The authority is large in the central area.  

Business engagements reveal good fortune in the east and west directions, while south and north are not favorable. Matters in business pertain to water and wood; when an owl enters the door, there will be stubborn talk.  

Beware of poor speech; this misfortune can be avoided.  

 

Kim Mi-ri  

Born in the year of Gyeo-myo on the twenty-first day of the eighth month in the hour of the Snake, the divination is summarized as follows:  
This year’s fortune holds the bird pecking at the dish; the fire command prevails. Fish leap into the great sea like renewing relationships.  

Amidst misfortune blooms fortune; be cautious of formation changes. The hexagram at the corners might harbor desires for change in southern direction.  

A cold wind ushers from the gold aspect. Wealth follows easily; the bright day during the winter reveals guests from the earth.  

The fortunes are abundant; every matter relies on centrality. Government affairs require retreat and cultivation of virtue.  

The white tiger may protect brothers, dreams might flourish this year; it is a great year of fortune.
