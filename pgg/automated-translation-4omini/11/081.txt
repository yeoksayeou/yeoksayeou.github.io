表紙  
This front cover was supposed to be published on January 1st, but it has been delayed, hence the lateness. Please regard it as the New Year issue.  

附錄  
As a New Year issue attachment, we intended to present a highly refined art calendar that you cannot find elsewhere, but due to circumstances, we regretfully had to cancel it. Nevertheless, we will provide other commemorative items on a different occasion.  

探査  
The investigation of disguised reporters was divided into three teams, which dispatched to three areas, but since the pages exceeded and the contents were similar, we only included the contributions from the three teams. <58>

**Summary**  

This article discusses the editorial notes regarding the delay in the publication of the magazine's front cover, the cancellation of a planned art calendar, and the findings of an investigation involving disguised reporters. It reflects the challenges faced by publication efforts during the era of colonial Korea, highlighting the interplay of artistic aspiration and political context. Historians might find the insights into how cultural production was affected by societal constraints particularly revealing.
