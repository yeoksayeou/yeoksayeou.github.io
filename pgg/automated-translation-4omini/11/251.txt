**Summary**

This brief announcement from the editorial department highlights their intention to solicit submissions for various contributions, emphasizing a focus on local culture through folk songs and communications. The solicitation for a diverse range of content reflects the editorial aim to engage with readers and preserve cultural elements during a time of colonial rule, suggesting an effort to foster a sense of community and identity in the face of external pressures. Historians may find the emphasis on local culture significant, as it illustrates the ways in which Korean writers and artists sought to maintain and celebrate Korean identity and traditions during Japan's colonial period.
