Warning Regarding Impostors  
Recently, there have been frequent rumors about individuals claiming to be "Kae-pilk Company reporters" who are wandering around and engaging in various fraudulent activities. I would like to advise you to be cautious and avoid associating with such individuals. At present, aside from Mr. Jeong Il-chang, who has returned to our company in the Jeollabuk-do region, there are no reporters on assignments in the provinces.  
Kae-pilk Company  

**Summary**  

The article serves as a public warning against impostors posing as reporters from the Kae-pilk Company who have been committing fraud in various localities. It emphasizes the importance of verifying the credentials of anyone claiming to be affiliated with the company. Such warnings reflect the broader context of mistrust and the challenges of media credibility during the colonial period in Korea. Historians may find it interesting as it highlights the vulnerability of the public to deception under colonial rule and the repercussions for legitimate news organizations.
