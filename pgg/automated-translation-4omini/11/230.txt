女事務員 (Female Clerk, Play)  

(The play begins with a scene depicting the work environment of a female clerk in an office.)

(Setting: An office, cluttered with documents, the sound of a typewriter clacking fills the air. The main character, a female clerk, enters stage left with a stack of papers.)

Clerk: (Checking her watch) It's already this late? The boss will be unhappy if he sees this pile of assignments. 

(Enter another colleague, a male clerk.)

Male Clerk: (Casually) You’re still here! You should go home; the night is getting deep.

Clerk: (Sighs) I can't leave until I finish here. There's no one else to handle these tasks. The boss counts on us to keep things running smoothly.

Male Clerk: But you’re always working late. You should prioritize yourself sometimes. 

Clerk: I understand, but if I don’t do it, who will? It seems like my hard work goes unnoticed anyway.

(The male clerk looks at her with pity.)

Male Clerk: Don’t say that. You’re quite talented. One day, you'll be acknowledged for what you do.

Clerk: (Smiling faintly) Thank you for your encouragement, but I doubt it. 

(The scene shifts as the lights dim and then brighten again, portraying the next day in the office. The boss enters.)

Boss: (Loudly) Where is that clerk? I need those reports on my desk now!

Clerk: (Rushing) Right away, sir! 

(As she hands over the reports, the boss barely glances at her.)

Boss: (Grumbling) This is late. Do I need to remind you that punctuality is essential? 

Clerk: (Nervously) I’m sorry, sir. I worked late last night to complete them.

Boss: (Waving her off) Just make sure it doesn’t happen again. 

(The boss exits, leaving the clerk looking dejected.)

Clerk: (To herself) No matter how hard I try, it seems I can never meet his expectations.

(She returns to her work as the lights fade.)

(The play continues to illuminate the struggles and societal expectations faced by female clerks in a patriarchal office environment, reflecting themes of underappreciation and the pursuit of recognition.)
