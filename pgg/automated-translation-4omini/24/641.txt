**Summary**  

This article encourages readers to contribute their thoughts by sending postcards, stating that there are no restrictions on content. It highlights the personal and varied nature of reader submissions, emphasizing the magazine's attempt to connect with its audience. From a historical perspective, this reflects the growing importance of public participation and expression in publications during Korea's colonial period, possibly indicating a shift towards more engagement in intellectual discourse and community feelings at that time.
