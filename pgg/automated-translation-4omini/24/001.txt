釼銘  
						李忠武公  
其一  
Three feet to swear to heaven, the mountains and rivers shift colors.  

其二  
With hands to sever the whale and shark, the spirit carries the mountains and rivers.  

**Summary**  

This poem reflects the deep connection between the ideals of loyalty and sacrifice for one's country, symbolized through the imagery of swearing an oath and the significance of nature in the face of adversity. It may resonate profoundly within the context of Korea's colonial experience during this time, as figures like Lee Chungmu-gong were likely grappling with the realities of national identity and resistance against oppression, which historians would find revealing in understanding cultural expressions of nationalism.
