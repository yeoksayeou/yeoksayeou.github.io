Mussolini's Ideal Village  
In Italy, the villages of Parassolo, Tero, and Stella are multi-child villages in accordance with the ideals of Prime Minister Mussolini. Among a total of 168 households, there are three households with 16 children, one household with 14 children, eight households with 13 children, eleven households with 12 children, twenty-two households with 11 children, and thirty-four households with 10 children. On average, each household has 9 children, which suggests that Mussolini's ideals are gradually being realized.  

**Summary**  

This article discusses the achievement of Mussolini's ideals in Italy, specifically focusing on certain villages that fulfill his vision of a multi-child society. The statistics presented illustrate a trend towards larger families, which were encouraged by fascist policies during that era. For historians of Korean colonial history, this could illustrate the broader implications of family and population policies adopted by colonial powers, as they often mirrored or contrasted with their own population control or family formation policies in colonized regions.
