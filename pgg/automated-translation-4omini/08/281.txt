Postcard Communication - Letter Submissions Welcome  

Starting from this issue, we have newly established an interesting communication column called "Postcard Communication." We hope you will refer to this column in this issue and make extensive use of it (Content is unrestricted; anything written on a postcard is welcome). <123>  

  

**Summary**  

This article announces the introduction of a new column dedicated to reader submissions in the magazine. It emphasizes that there are no restrictions on the content of the postcards submitted, inviting contributions from the readership. This openness in communication reflects the editorial team's intention to engage with the audience, indicating a shift towards more participatory forms of media during the 1920s. For historians, the establishment of such a reader interaction platform could be indicative of broader trends in cultural expression and shifts in media consumption in colonial Korea.
