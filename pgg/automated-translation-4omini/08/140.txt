放學동안의 京城거리  
Kyŏngsŏng, the heart of Korea, presents a vibrant scene during the summer vacation period. As the students pour into the streets after classes, life in the city takes on a unique rhythm. The two months of respite from academic duties transform the normally bustling lanes into a playground for youth across the city.  

On the sidewalks, one can observe children engrossed in games and revelry. Some engage in spirited games of tag, while others might be seen flying kites high against the azure sky. Street vendors peddle sweet treats that become particularly popular with children decked out in summer attire, enjoying the warmth of the day.

As the sun sets, the colors of the city shift from bright pastels to a muted dusk. The evening sounds reflect a blend of chatter, laughter, and the occasional shout of delight as friends reunite after a long day. The air is filled with excitement and adventure, showcasing the young spirits of Korea thriving during this carefree break from school. 

The day concludes, and lamps illuminate the streets of Kyŏngsŏng, casting shadows that dance along the walls as revelers drift homeward, each carrying a piece of summer memories to cherish until the school bell rings once again.
