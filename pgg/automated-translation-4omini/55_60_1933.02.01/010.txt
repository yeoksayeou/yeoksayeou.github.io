When the Great Full Moon of the first month  
Returns,  
The people of the countryside  
Are under the moon.  

If it rises at the North,  
Harvests are plenty in the mountains of Sanhap,  
If it ascends to the South,  
There will be a good harvest by the seaside.  

When the moonlight is red,  
Large persimmons abound,  

When the moonlight is white,  
A great flood will occur.  

To know of a great harvest,  
One has to look for the round and yellow ones.  

-Original Poem-  

Farmers' First Month Moon  
Test the moon's ascent to heaven  

Near the North, abundant harvest in Sanhap,  
To the South, the harvest is plentiful by the seaside.  

Red is feared by withered grass and trees,  
White is feared by the rising of the deep waters.  

When they are round and deep yellow,  
Then it is known there will be a great year.  
(Original by Che Ch'ang-yŏn, a scholar of the Seonjo era) <2>  

Nodari  
-A Song from Andong County's Full Moon Festival, Green Bridge Song-  

On the metallic bridge over the Cheongcheon,  
With hands extended,  
Coming from Gyeongsang Province.  

For what purpose have they come?  
They've come dressed to impress.  

They stepped over fifty-five intervals,  

What hat are they wearing?  
They are wearing a Yongdang hat.  

What headdress are they wearing?  
They have a white headdress.  

What shoes are they wearing?  
They have on clown shoes.  

What trousers are they wearing?  
They are wearing pearl trousers.  

What socks are they wearing?  
They are wearing braided socks.  

-This song is sung by women while enjoying the moonlight on the night of the full moon during the first month in Andong, Gyeongsangbuk-do, in a dance formation resembling a horse race, and it is said to have originated when King Gongsun of Goryeo sought refuge there.  

**Summary**  

The article presents two traditional Korean folk songs associated with the full moon, emphasizing agricultural prosperity tied to lunar phases. The first song, a folk narrative, describes the significance of the moon's color in predicting harvest outcomes, while the second song captures the festive spirit of women celebrating the full moon night in Andong. This depiction of folk traditions offers insights into the agrarian culture of Korea during the colonial period and reflects a blend of superstition and community celebration that historians may find relevant in understanding Korean societal resilience and cultural identity under colonial rule.

舊正俗謠, 望月謠
正月에 大보름이
도라오면은
農村의 사람들이
달마지하네.
北으로 닥어 뜨면
山陜 풍년들고
南으로 기으치면
海邊 풍년드네.

달빗이 붉으며은
큰 감을 들고

달빗이 희면은
대홍수 난다.

그중에 큰 풍년 알려면은
둥굴고 누른 것을 봐야한다네.

-原詩-

農家正月望
嘗候月昇天

近北豐山陜
差南稔海邊

赤疑枯草木
白怕漲淵天

圓滿深黃色
方知大有年
(宣祖時易學者 車滄淵雲* 原作)＜2＞
