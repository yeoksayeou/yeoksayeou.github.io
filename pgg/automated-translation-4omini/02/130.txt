Each Person, Each Color (Part Three)  

Mr. Yu Jin-tae was the head of the Korea Education Association. His sincerity and diligence are such that no one can help but be impressed. When he speaks, his slightly graying hair is often brushed back, and he resembles a blue mountain tiger that cannot eat alone unless it has captured a fat female prey, growling softly to itself. His large eyes and mouth move back and forth, and he often spreads his long legs while seated at the desk. Although he often talks, there is not much to highlight; however, among foods, he particularly enjoys smoking and loves white rice cakes. Not having sufficient money, he spends time at a rice cake shop, watching the freshly made and steaming white rice cakes, or when seeing them served at a tavern, he cannot help but drool, even if he is pious, taking out a handkerchief from his pocket. <33>

各人各色 (其三)
兪鎭泰씨는 朝鮮敎育會의 집 직힘이엿다. 그의 誠勤은 누구나 感服치 안이치 못 한다. 말할때이면 히끗히끗한 머리를 의례 압흐로 쭈악쭈악하고 마치 靑山老虎가 살진 암캐를 무러다 노코 니가 업서 먹지를 못하고 혼자 으르릉 으르릉 하듯이 그 큰 눈과 큰 입을 좌우로 실눅실눅 하기도 하며 또 긴다리로 각금 책상다리를 하고 안젓다 이러낫다 한다. 그 이 기호로. 말하면 별로 이럿타 할 것이 업스나 음식중으로는 담배를 특기하는 외에 흰떡(白餠)을 매우 조와하는데 돈이 넉넉지 못한 그는 떡집을 지내다가 흰떡을 새로처서 김이 무룩무룩 나는 것을 보든지, 또 선술집에서 흰떡 안주 맨드러노흔 것을 보면 아모리 노인이 점잔을 피우랴 하야도 침이 저절로 흘너서 각금 품속에서 수건을 끄낸다고 한다.＜33＞
