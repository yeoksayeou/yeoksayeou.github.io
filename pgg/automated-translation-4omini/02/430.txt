Three Sighs  
						Kim Seok-song  
1. The Bee's Burden  
Even if the body is whole, the bee, if it allows itself to be caught, gets tired of the burden placed upon it, and  
In the end, to be tormented by others, who can endure this?  

If taking away the labor of another is a sin, is the one who takes it not guilty?  
Even if I search for work, there is nowhere to put my hands.  
Is it that there is no work, or that my body cannot endure it?  

Even if I am unworthy, I will live; even if I am worthy, I will live.  
It is difficult to seek work with my own ability,  
Then I would rather create work for myself.  

2. The Place of Work  
Do not just burn in your chest because there is no place to work.  
If a place of work will give birth, will your heart be at ease?  
In the period when you work for others, your own work is being neglected.  

Even if you spend a lifetime in another's work, you cannot taste your own work.  
To do the work of others and still be fulfilled is a burden to bear;  
After all the toil, what can possibly fill the belly?  

If merely to secure a meal, you work for another,  
It would be better to go to the countryside with a hoe and plow,  
In this way, I can create my own workplace.  

3. Longing for Mother  
Why does the rain pour down all day long?  
I watch over the chick that has just hatched,  
Spending a long day filled with longing.  

The mother bee has gone out, and does not return until evening,  
When I hear the faint sound of a sleeping child,  
Could it be that the mother bee is simply drifting away?  

While the curtain is pulled up, through the window flows rain,  
I check and open the door to look out,  
Even though the rain continues to fall, the human does not return.  
(Bing-in April 17th, at Hyoja-dong residence)

嘆息三章
						金石松
1. 벌이 일흔몸
육신이 멀정해도 벌이 만일허봐라
게름에 저진몸이 놀기도 실증나니
남에게 시달님이 차라리 나헛던가

일터를 뺏어감은 뺏는이 죄라할가
일터를 찻자하나 손닷는 곳업스니
일터가 업슴인가 이몸이 못남인가

못나도 나는나요 잘나도 나는나다
내몬의 됨됨이가 일터찻기 어려우니
차라리 내스스로 일거리를 만들가

2. 품터
품터가 업다하야 가슴만 태지말아
품터가 생기면은 네속이 편할것가
남의 품하는 동안 네품은 싸히느니

한편생 두고해도 못다맛칠이내품＜138＞
젓처두고 하는건 밥벌이의 남의품
그리고도 곱흔배 무엇으로 채이리

배채기만 위하야 남의품 한다하면
차라리 시골가서 광이들고 밧파지
이밧게더 존품터 또어대 매잇스리

3. 애보기
비는 어이짓구저 종일두고 퍼붓나
병아리 갓흔어린 것 어머일코 보재니
기나긴 몸 하루를 애달내기 보내네

벌이나간 어미는 저물도록 안오고
젓배곱하 졸으는 아이소리 들을제
나간 어미배인들 오작이나 곰흐리

창밧겐 실비오고 내속엔 왕비온다
이제나 하고서 문열고 내다보니
비는 줄곳와도요 사람일낭안오네
