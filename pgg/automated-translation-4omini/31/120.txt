Q&A Record (9) 

Reporter: If a girl approaches you saying she wants to have a romantic relationship, how would you handle it?  
Lee: There’s no choice but to evade. Since love cannot be had, it’s better not to have any delightful possibilities. If an absolutely beautiful woman were to approach me like that, then I might think about not avoiding her.

**Summary**  

In this article, notable writer Lee Kwang-soo discusses his perspective on romantic entanglements when approached by a woman. He expresses a rather resigned attitude towards love, suggesting that if one cannot engage in it, it is preferable to live without the pleasure of potential relationships. The article reflects early 20th-century attitudes towards romance in Korea, particularly under colonial rule, illustrating the interplay between societal expectations and personal desire during a time of significant cultural tension. Historians may note the influence of colonial experiences on personal relationships and the evolving notions of love and attraction in Korea.

一問一答記(9)
李光洙

記者, 지금 어느 女子가 작고만 戀愛를 하자고 덤비면 어더케 處置하시겟슴니까?
李, 피하는 수 밧게 업지요. 이왕 戀愛를 못하게 된 바에야 맛나는 것이 도리어 자미가 업스니까요-絶世美人이 작고만 그럿케 쬬차 온다면 혹 피하지 아니할 생각이 날지도 모르지만-
