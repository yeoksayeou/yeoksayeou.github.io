Smoking Room

After dinner, smoking a cigarette brings about a pleasant conversation. A light and enjoyable chat while feeling bored! Those who do not smoke can feel left out.

Joseon has a bountiful harvest, and Japan is experiencing great prosperity!! The officials of the ruling class boast about this. If only they could explain why the rice prices have plummeted and failed to reach the farmers, I would be grateful.

As autumn arrived, despite the officials saying it was good that there are no homeless people, they have yet to express concern about the corpses that might appear on the roads due to the cold. This year, it seems water damage has affected many households.

Since September 1st, the Governor-General's office has implemented cost-cutting measures for expenses related to travel. Those who cannot go will be disappointed, but the cut in social expenses for local officials may indeed be a twofold benefit.

While some things are likely to be cut back, tobacco is not one of them. In just the month of September, the monopoly bureau has released over 330 million cigarettes, and there are still more. With 332,890 pyeong (archaic unit of weight) of purchased tobacco, it feels like we're only consuming smoke instead of food and becoming immortal.

It is said that liquor will also soon be available for sale through monopolies; will people start looking for official labels even on salted fish sauce, which is known for such behavior? One might be guzzling makgeolli (rice wine) filled with loyalty while feeling frustrated!

It seems that a certain girls' school in Gyeongseong is set to be closed. Even if it is to be shut down, the principal won't have to be let go, right? As students disperse and schools are shuttered, the principal can still manage to do their job within the district office.

Amidst complaints of ill-treatment, they allowed more than 30 or 40 students to be expelled in one go while still presenting a report to the news reporters that the issues have been resolved. If the principal had been in the police station, they would surely write a good report.

It has been announced that new textbooks will feature works by private authors. While they may be waking up late, it is necessary to fix the habit of including works without obtaining the authors’ approval to avoid future troubles.

It is said that in the current compilation of Korean history, there will be a deletion of the phrase mentioning Queen Sondok (神功皇后) leading the expedition against the Three Kingdoms (三韓). The reason is that there are no such facts in the traditional Korean history. It seems the conscience of scholars is finally awakening.

Lately, the politics column and arts column of a certain newspaper have been unable to reach readers who do not understand Japanese. If they wish to translate merely that, wouldn't it be better to publish the original telegram communications or Japanese magazines as they are?

Lawyer Kim U-young has opened a shared office with Maruyama Keijirō in Meiji Town. This could be seen as Korea and Japan merging in small matters.

At Wonsan High School for Girls, it has been resolved to remove Nakatazaki-kun's travelogue titled "Saga-no." It appears that the school has received first prize for banning destabilizing thoughts regarding matrimony.

The local police station conducted health examinations for female employees in the dining establishments within their jurisdiction on September 1 and 2, and among the 586 examinees, 32 were found to have venereal diseases. A friend enforcing discipline might be dealing with syphilis cases above stage 3.

A professor from a British university has announced that the Second World War will occur within the next few years, causing shrewd merchants to dream of profits... Is there anything that Koreans can dream of?

**Summary**

The article discusses various social issues in Korea during the colonial period, touching on topics such as famine, the agricultural crisis, and health concerns related to syphilis. It highlights the disconnect between the government's optimistic proclamations about prosperity and the harsh reality faced by ordinary citizens. Historians might find the juxtaposition of official propaganda and genuine social distress particularly revealing in examining colonial governance and its failures.

吸煙室
저녁밥 먹고는 담배를 피여 물고 담배를 피여들면 한담이 나온다. 심심하면서도 별다른 맛잇는 한담! 실치 안흔 사람은 한대 픠여들고 옴이 可흠.

朝鮮도 豐年 日本도 大豐!! 大端히 깃부다는 發表를 벼슬하는 兩班들이 하신다. 무엇이 엇더케 깃븐지 米價暴落으로 빗도 다 못갑흘 農民들에게도 說明을 좀 해주섯스면 感謝하겟구먼.

가을이 되여서 露宿群이 업서젓스니 조흔 일이라고 깃버하는 칼찬 兩班은 잇서도 住所업는 路上凍屍가 뒤니어 생길 것을 걱정하는 官吏의 말슴은 아즉 發表를 못보앗다. 금년에는 水害에 집 일흔 사람이 만엇다지요?

총독부 관리의 旅費 긴축이 9월 1일부터 실시되엿다. 자조 못갈 사람은 섭섭할넌지 모르나 지방관공리의 交際費도 긴축되겟스니 이거야말로 一擧에 兩得이랄 것일가.

긴축되기 쉬울 듯하면서 못되는 것은 담배다. 9月 한달 동안에만 專賣局에서 나온 卷煙이 3億3281萬箇하고도 또 잇소이다. 살 담배 33萬2890貫!! 밥 안먹고 煙氣만 먹으니 神仙이 되엿지.

압흐로는 酒類도 專賣를 하리라니 새우젓 소곰에 專賣局딱지가 부터지지 아느려는가 홧김에 마시는 막걸니도 軍庫補助로 忠誠스럽게 먹을 판!

校長閣下가 送局된 京城某女學校가 廢校되리란다. 廢校는 될 망정 校長이야 내여놋켓소? 學生이 헤여지고 學校가 업서지고 XX局안에서도 校長노릇만 하면 되지.

배호겟다고 더 잘 배호겟다고 매여달니는 어린 학생들을 단번에 30명씩 40명씩 퇴학시이면서도 신문 기자보고는 無事解決되엿슴니다고. 校長내놋코 駐在所 벼슬을 하엿드면 報告書는 잘 쓸것.

새로 編纂되는 敎科書에 民間作家의 作品이 실닌다고. 늣게 깨인 머리일망정 무던은 하지만 作家의 承諾업시 실는 버릇은 미리 고처야 後患을 免할 것.

敎科書 編纂 말이 낫스닛가 말이지 이번에 編纂하는 朝鮮歷史에는 神功皇后 三韓征伐하얏다는 句節을 削除하기로 하얏다는데 그 理由는 在來 朝鮮歷史에는 그런 事實이 全혀 업는 까닭이라고. 學者의 良心이 이제야 發生하는 모양.

요새 某新聞의 政治蘭 學藝欄은 日本말 모르는 讀者는 닑을 재조 업스니 그러케 토만 飜譯하려거던 電報通信이나 日文雜誌를 고대로 寫眞版으로 揭載하는 것이 엇덧소.

辯護士 金雨英君은 丸山敬次郞君과 明治町에 公同事務所를 내엿다. 이를 터이면 日韓小合倂이지.

元山高等女學校에서는 4學年 讀本 中谷崎君의 『嵯峨野』란 紀行文을 除去하기로 決議하얏다. 讓妻不穩思想取締에 一等賞金은 그 學校에서 구어 노흔 당상.

本町署에서는 9月1,2兩日間 그 管內飮食店雇女, 其外 女給, 仲介女등 健康診斷을 하얏는데 受診者 586名중 花柳病者 32名이나 된단다. 風紀取締하는 친구의 코는 第3期 梅毒患者 以上으로 불거젓슬 듯.

第2의 世界大戰亂이 이 數年안으로 니러난다고 英國의 某大學敎授가 發表하여 눈치빠른 장사치들이 돈벌이할 꿈을 꾼다고... 朝鮮 사람 꿈꿀 일이 업겟는가.
