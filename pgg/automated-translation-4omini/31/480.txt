The Choson Light Company (朝鮮之光社) and the Women's Era Company (女性時代社) are two houses located quite close to each other. They share the same toilet, as neither has one of their own. One day, Mr. Park Yeong-hui from the Choson Light Company and Mr. Yun Baek-nam from the Women's Era Company, happened to meet in the toilet. An employee from the Women's Era Company urgently came in and called out, “Sir?” Upon hearing the response “Uh?” from Mr. Yun in one stall and “Uh?” from Mr. Park in the other stall (thinking it was their own company members calling them), the person waiting outside remarked, “Which school office is this shared toilet? There are so many teachers!? Ha ha...”  

**Summary**  

This light-hearted article humorously depicts a situation where two men from different publishing companies unintentionally create a comical misunderstanding in a shared toilet. The anecdote reflects the interactions and camaraderie between the emerging media and literary circles in colonial Korea during the 1930s. Historians might find it interesting not only as a glimpse into the everyday lives of these publishing houses but also as it highlights social norms and humor among intellectuals during this politically charged era.
