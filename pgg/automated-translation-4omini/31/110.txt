Q&A Record (8)  

Reporter: Have you ever gone to a place like a brothel (遊廓)?  
Zhu: I have never done so. When I was in China, I said I would go for sightseeing, but I ended up not going.  

 
**Summary**  

This brief exchange reveals Zhu Yohan's stance on visiting a brothel, which he has not done despite expressing interest while in China. The article provides a glimpse into personal habits and societal norms of the time, particularly regarding attitudes towards places of leisure and gender relations during the colonial period in Korea. Historians might find this revealing about the moral landscape and social expectations placed on individuals, as well as the contrasts in behavior between colonial society and the mainland.
