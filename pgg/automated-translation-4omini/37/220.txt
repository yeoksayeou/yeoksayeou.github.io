The Wonderful Method of Ordering  

New Woman April issue 20 jeon. Children's commemorative issue 10 jeon. If you order them together, the shipping cost will be lower and it will be beneficial. Please be sure to do so. 

And the subscription for Byeolgeongon (별건곤) is 5 jeon, but ordering just that will cost more than the price of the magazine itself. Therefore, please either order it along with other books or send 50 jeon as a prepayment for one year. <25>

**Summary**  

This article promotes the benefits of ordering multiple magazine issues at once to save on shipping costs, while encouraging subscriptions to Byeolgeongon. The mention of a children's commemorative issue and the promotion targeted toward "New Women" suggests growing awareness and validation of women's roles in Korean society during the colonial period. Historians might find the advertising approach indicative of shifting cultural expectations and the increasing press power attracting a new demographic of readers, particularly women.

注文의 妙法
新女性 4월호 20錢. 어린이 記念號 10錢. 주문하실 때 한꺼번에 하시면 送料 덜 들고 유리함니다. 꼭 가티 하십시요.
그리고 별건곤은 책갑시 5錢인데 그것만 주문하면 책갑보다 비용이 더 만히 들음니다. 그러니까 달은 책과 함끠 주문하든지 壹年 先金 五拾錢을 보내든지 하시요.＜25＞
