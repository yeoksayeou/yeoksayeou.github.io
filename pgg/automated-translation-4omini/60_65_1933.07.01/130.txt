新舊 모던꼴불견  
						黃貞秀  

The comparison of new and old modern eyesores is a pressing topic in today's conversation. Old-fashioned structures and designs are contrasted with the newly emerging modernist trends that prioritize efficiency and functionality over aesthetic considerations. This discourse reveals not only taste preferences but also a cultural and social commentary on the evolution of urban landscapes, illustrating a clash between tradition and modernity. The implications of these shifts indicate an ongoing struggle for identity within a growing modern society where modernization is seen often as an obligation rather than a choice.  

A particularly striking aspect includes the suggestion that the current generation is throwing away the beauty of tradition for the sake of modern conveniences, leading to a loss of cultural heritage. Simultaneously, there is a challenge in embracing new forms that may lack the depth of historical significance. It is this ambivalence that creates a fertile ground for debate, as people grapple with what is lost and gained in the name of progress.  

The artist humorously portrays various scenes, with caricatures that illustrate everyday situations where modern conveniences conflict with traditional values. Observers might find this struggle reflective of broader themes in Korean colonial history, particularly in the ways modernization has been perceived under colonial rule. Historians might be drawn to the tension represented here, as it encapsulates the shift in identity and values among Koreans during a time of significant social change.
