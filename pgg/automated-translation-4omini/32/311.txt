Fourth Anniversary Great Prize  

Although it is said that the traffic in 대京城 (Great Capital City) is complicated, in reality, there are few who can accurately grasp it mathematically. I believe it would be beneficial to imagine this once and to actually investigate the reality.  

-【Question】-  
On November 21 (Friday)  
How many people will pass by 경성 안국동 육거리 (Gyeongseong Anguk-dong Sixway) between 8:00 AM and 9:00 AM?  
(This includes streetcars, automobiles, and various vehicles carrying passengers.)  

○ Our company will conduct a real traffic survey.  

○ If it is rainy on that day or if there is a malfunction, the count will be taken at the same time on the following day, November 22.  

A prize of ten won will be awarded to one correct answerer. Those closest to the correct number will receive a consolation prize of a round garment.  

○ Deadline: Must be submitted by November 20.  
Reference: As a reference, 8,162 people passed by 종로네거리 (Jongno's Sixway) from 7:30 AM to 8:30 AM on October 26, the 14th year of Taisho (大正十四年). This has been announced for your reference.  

  
**Summary**  

This article announces a prize competition focused on quantifying pedestrian traffic in Gyeongseong (modern-day Seoul). Contestants are asked to predict the number of passersby at a specific location and time. The mention of a traffic survey conducted by the company highlights efforts to gather data on urban life during the colonial period. Historians may find the competitive aspect revealing of societal engagement and the increasing interest in empirical data collection, mirroring urbanization trends in Korea during Japanese rule.
