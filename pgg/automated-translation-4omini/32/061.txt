The so-called rice price collapse countermeasure meeting convenes every day, like a stream from the private sector to government offices, yet it seems ineffectual and the rice price continues to drop. If this goes on, the countermeasure meetings themselves will likely turn into empty discussions after their conclusion.

However, when looking at the figures who claim to study these so-called countermeasures, most of them either are large landowners or salaried workers who don't suffer directly from the pain of hunger. Wouldn't it be a small relief, even in terms of appearance, to discuss matters in the funeral parlor rather than join the voices singing their praises?

When one says the rice price is plummeting, it's true—rice prices have collapsed, but other prices remain unchanged; how can we initiate a rice price raise movement while simultaneously addressing the rise of other prices?

On a different note, the British airship R101, which was visiting India, exploded near the vicinity of Beauvais, France, resulting in 49 deaths, including the British Secretary of Air, Lord Thomson. It seems there were Indian terrorists who had formed an anti-British movement in the air.

According to reports in a certain newspaper, even in the Chōsen Bank of Gyeongseong (now Seoul), a short-staffed girl has appeared, standing by the electric advertisement tower, telling passersby, "Moshi moshi, anata," while putting a hand on people's arms, seemingly wishing for a big Yamato nation and asserting that if she were a woman, she would be exempt from worries about unemployment.

Recent publication suggests that the ratio of the total population of Gyeongseong to police is said to be 1 police officer to every 900 citizens. Compared to the ideal of one officer per citizen, it seems the future is still quite distant, which is a cause for lamentation.

On October 5, a charitable dance event organized by the personal initiative of Yu Fengzhi, the wife of Zhang Xueliang from Fengtian, raised 30,000 yen in one night. Meanwhile, a fundraising initiative by the Korean Social Service Association with support from the authorities for flood relief only managed to raise 1,400 yen over four months (as of October 8). Whether this reflects Korea's poverty or the sincerity of that association is unknown; one cannot help but wonder about their shameful face in the matter.

Recently, a soldier of the 75th Infantry Regiment, Otsuka Toshihiko, who participated in the exercises of the 19th division, was stationed in Docho-myeon of Wonju-gun, and deserted at night after disarming. Although military drills are important, shouldn't they also practice retreating to survive in case of an emergency?

The world-renowned anti-aging authoritative figure, Doctor Schmidt, who promoted surgery to constrict men's vas deferens to prevent aging, has committed suicide due to life difficulties. If one commits suicide before aging, then everlasting youth may truly be realized.

**Summary**

This article reflects the socio-economic turmoil of Korea under Japanese colonial rule, highlighting issues such as the collapsing rice prices and the ineffectiveness of governmental policies in addressing the urgent needs of the populace. It also illustrates the disparity between the wealthy elite and the struggling ordinary farmers, revealing a critical view on societal inequalities and the perceived ineffectiveness of countermeasures aimed at alleviating poverty. Historians may find the commentary on the disparity in relief efforts for natural disasters particularly revealing, reflecting on the colonial government's priorities and the deep sense of disenfranchisement felt by Koreans.
