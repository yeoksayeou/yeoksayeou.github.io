Talks of the Academic World, Specially on Hweemun High School  
Lee Il’s writing  

Mr. Lee Il, an English teacher, is well-known as a sports teacher, but he is also said to be the best at practical jokes in Donggyo (동교, a school). Once, Mr. Kim Do-tae, the history teacher, was taking a nap in the dormitory when Mr. Lee sneaked up and tied his hands and feet to chairs, covering his glasses with black ink. When the class time arrived, Mr. Kim suddenly woke up, feeling heavy in his limbs and hearing strange noises. Upon opening his eyes, he found everything pitch dark. As he exclaimed, “Ugh, my eyes…,” the laughter of several teachers, including Mr. Lee, burst from behind him.  

Mr. Jang Yeong-jeon’s Chestnut  
Mr. Jang Yeong-jeon, now an inspector at the Governor-General's Office, recalls a time when he was at Hweemun High School. This teacher, who enjoys snacks like candy and roasted chestnuts, would sneakily munch on roasted chestnuts even while teaching in front of the classroom. Writing “Energy is…” on the blackboard, he would occasionally tap the board with a large stick, walking back and forth in front of the class. While the students concentrated hard on their notes, he would discreetly pull a roasted chestnut from his pocket, pretending to wipe his nose, and pop it into his mouth while nibbling.  

Woodpecker Mr. Seo Sang-seop  
“There is a subject called ‘National Second Rights. Woodpecker of the Third Rights’.” When Mr. Seo Sang-seop, an English teacher, taught this subject, he pronounced “Woodpecker” in such a pathetic manner that the students started calling him “Woodpecker.” Now, what is his nickname?  

**Summary**  

This article humorously recounts several anecdotes from teachers at Hweemun High School in the 1930s. It presents the lighthearted nature of school life during the colonial period, emphasizing the relationships between students and teachers and their playful interactions. Historians may find the depiction of educational environments and teacher-student dynamics in a colonial context particularly interesting, as it offers insight into the cultural exchanges and everyday lives of individuals during this time.

學界漫話 徽文高普編
李一씨작란
영어선생 李一씨는 스포-쓰 선생으로 유명하지만 작란잘하기로도 동교에서 제일간다고.
한번은 역사선생인 金道泰씨가 숙직실에서 낫잠을 자는데 李씨가 몰래 달려들더니 金씨의 수족을 각기 의자에 붓드러매고 안경에다가는 먹칠을 새까마케하야노왓다.
金씨 교수시간이 되엿나 하고 벌떡 이러나는데 이게 웬일이냐. 수족이 묵직해지며 무엇이 우루루 너머진다. 그리고 눈을 떠보니 압히 캄캄하엿다. 「으으 이눈이...」하는 말슴을 하는데 등뒤에서는 李씨를비롯하야 여러선생의 우슴보가 탁 터젓다.

張膺震氏의 군밤
張膺震씨 지금은 총독부시학관이지만 이전 휘문고보에 잇슬 때 일이다. 이선생 눈깔사탕과 군밤가튼 군것질을 잘하시는데 교실 교단우에서도 군밤을 슬금슬금 우물거럿다.
「에네르기라는 것은... ...」 하고 칠판에다 몃줄써노코 짤막한 대막대기로 칠판을 몃번 똑똑두드리고는 교단을 왓다갓다한다. 학생들이 일심정력으로 필긔하는 동안에 선생님호 주머니에서 군밤 한개 끄내여 코씻는 체하다가 슬적 입안으로 모시고는 우물우물.

우-드페커- 徐相燮
「내슈낼 둘재권인가. 셋재권에 우-드페커-수*木鳥-딱따구리」라는 과목이 잇다. 영어선생인 徐相燮씨 이 과목 가르칠 때 엇지나 청승맛게 우-드페커-발음을 잘하엿든지 그때 학생들이 徐씨를 우-드페카-라고 불럿다고. 그러면 지금 별명은 무엇인지?＜29＞
