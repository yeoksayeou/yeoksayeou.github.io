In the public agricultural school and Cheongdeok Girls' High School, the distance is about fifty meters, and in the eastern sports field, female students engage in physical activities while male students exhibit their own behaviors in the western sports field. 

The students of the agricultural school are mercilessly competitive and persistent in their approaches. The cultivation of schools is secondary to the fervent exchanges of admiration for the students of Cheongdeok. Whether breakfast at the boarding house has arrived late or early, students rush out when the time comes for Cheongdeok girls to head to school, opening yesterday's worn school bags and bustling down narrow old streets. If by chance they meet a girl, they greet her with remarks like “looking quite dainty” or “oh, how lovely” and jest about it.

Moreover, when farming on the grounds, if a female student passes by, the boys gather at the roadside like sheep, scoring first on facial beauty, with the lowest score being 0.2 and the highest 90. When they return to the dormitory, they hold a meeting to announce scores for the reception; those who received the lowest are reportedly dismayed and excessively devoted to looking in mirrors and applying white powder and creams.

Additionally, when agricultural students are seen carrying a bucket, they cover their mouths and noses and flee amidst mulberry groves. It seems they amble around the main streets until late at night, boasting and then finally going to sleep. When they meet male students, they act coquettishly, with flirtatious glances and bright smiles. It appears they are somewhat “hysterical” in their mannerisms.

When male students are playing soccer in the sports field, the sight of girls appearing at the main gate stirs them to show off, kicking the ball as if to reach the sky. This seems to be to impress the female students with points.

Even in classrooms while cleaning, they can be observed staring out of the second-floor windows for a long time when a girl walks by, seemingly refreshing their spirits. Is this acceptable? Do the school authorities and parents ignore this reality, knowing fully well? I can't help but wonder.

  

**Summary**  

This article discusses the playful and competitive interactions between male and female students at Yeongbyeon, illustrating their social dynamics at the public agricultural school and Cheongdeok Girls' High School in the 1930s. The playful banter and competitive scoring of beauty reflect the youthful fervor and societal norms of that era. Historians may find it compelling how these interactions reveal the rigid gender roles and expectations during Korea's colonial period, highlighting the emerging youth culture amidst the oppressive backdrop of Japanese colonial rule.

寧邊校風漫話, 讀者欄
						寧邊一讀者
公立農業學校와 崇德女子高等學校와는 그 距離가 約五十米나되는데 東편 運動場에서는 女學生 西편 運動場에서는 男學生이 各己서로서로 태도를 부리며 運動을한다.
農校生은 *끗하고 우명하기가 아조더할나위업다. 學校修養은 第二次로하고 崇德여학生과 度數맛치기에 大熱誠이다. 下宿집 朝飯이야 이르거나 늦거나 먹엇거나 말엇거나. 崇德女子 登校時間만되면 昨日에 싸노앗든 책보를 엽헤끼고 좁은 舊거리로 막다러간다. 요행이 한 女子를 만나면 아츰 첫인사로「식큰둥하고나」「아이고 고와라」하며 별의별 조롱을 부친다.
그뿐만아니라 農場에가서 實習을하다가 萬若에 女學生이 지나가면 길엽헤 羊群가티 우-ㄱ 하고 모여와 섯는다. 첫재로 얼골의 美를 점수로 審判하는데 최하로 0·2점, 최고로 90점까지 꼰는다. 寄宿舍에를가면 受付點數發表大會를 開催한다는데 최하의 점수로 受付한 여자는 분기가 왓짝 나서 體鏡만 바라보고 白粉바르기와 크림바르기에 大熱心이란다.
그뿐만아니라 農校生徒가 똥통을 메고 나오면 口鼻를 트러막고 桑園숩사이로 네발거름을 처서 도망을친다. 이것은 그럿코 밤 三更까지 大市街를 意氣揚揚하야 삼사회순회를하고야 잠을 자는듯하다. 더욱이나 男學生을 만나게되면 服裝態度를부리며 겻눈도주며 햇쪽햇쪽웃기도한다. 이것을 보면 벌서「히스테리」에 걸닌듯하다.
男學生은 運動場에서 蹴球를할 때 女生徒가 正門을 턱나오는 것을 보기가 무섭게 大멋을부리며 놉흔 하늘을 찌를뜻이 공을 찬다. 이것은 女學生에게 點數를만히엇기爲하는까닭갓다.
또 敎室에서 掃除를하다가도 女子가 가는 것을 2층 窓門으로 한참이나 바라보야만 心身이 爽快한듯이보인다. 아서라. 이것이 될일이냐, 學校當局者와 學父兄은 이 事實을 알고도 모르는체 함이냐. 무러보고 십흔일이다.
