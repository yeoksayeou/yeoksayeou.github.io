Mountain Pass  
						Kim Eok  
On a night when the light snow falls,  
To meet me,  
You came across the mountain pass.  

When the dawn rooster crows,  
I send you off,  
Wishing you well as you go  
Over the mountain pass.  

When it becomes a night of snowfall,  
What happened then,  
Is not a thing to forget,  
And will appear again. <163>  

**Summary**  

This poem captures a poignant moment of longing and farewell, set against the backdrop of a snowy mountain pass. The speaker expresses a deep connection with the person they are meeting, as well as a bittersweet acceptance of parting. The imagery evokes feelings that resonate with the sorrowful experiences of separation, which can be tied to the historical context of Korea during colonial times, where such emotional expressions might reflect the broader experiences of loss and distance felt by many at that time. Historians might find the poem notable for its emotional depth, illustrating personal experiences in a period marked by social and political upheaval.

山고개
						金億
쌀락눈 오는 밤에
나와 만나려
山고개를 넘어서
그대가 왓소.

자즌 닭 꼬꼬 울제
나는 그대를
山고개 넘겨 주며
잘 가라 햇소.

눈 오는 밤이 되면
그 때의 일이
아니도 니치우고
다시 보이오. ＜163＞
