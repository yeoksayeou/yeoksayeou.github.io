Request for Return of March Issue

别乾坤 has been sold out with each issue, but particularly the March issue was sold out in just five days. Orders have come in, and there was a newspaper advertisement stating, "Don't order anymore." However, as there is no way to have it stored as documentation at our office, we will send the March issue back to our office, and those who return it by July 10 will receive the July or August issue in exchange.  

**Summary**  

The article discusses the rapid sellout of the March issue of the magazine, which occurred within just five days, and expresses regret that it cannot be reprinted or stored for future reference. To accommodate readers who wish to have this issue, the magazine offers a special exchange: those who return the March issue by July 10 will receive one of the upcoming issues instead. This reflects the challenges of managing publication logistics during the colonial period in Korea, demonstrating both the demand for cultural and literary content and the limitations imposed by the publishing industry at that time. Historians may find the emphasis on reader engagement particularly revealing in terms of the cultural dynamics during Japanese occupation, as it underscores the importance of printed media in a colonized society.
