Method for Storing Eggs  

In winter, if you pile eggs inside rice husks, you can store them that way. In summer, put them in a large basket in such a way that they don't touch each other, and hang them in a cool place. Alternatively, you can also pile them inside ashes, and if you pack them with fifty pounds of coal in between the eggs and put them in a rice container, you can keep them there for six months without any trouble. However, it is essential that the eggs are fresh from the beginning. <38>

鷄卵貯藏法
겨울에는 왕겨 속에 무더두면 곳치만 녀름에는 넓은 바구니 가튼데 서로 맛닷치 안케 하나씩 떼여노코 서늘한 곳에 달어매여 둡니다. 또는 재ㅅ속에다 무더두면 이삼개월도 가고 한되물에 五十匁되는 석탄을 석근 속에 계란을 담그고 뚝게를 씨워서 마루밋헤다 느어두면 오육개월을 두어도 골치 안습니다. 그러나 처음부터 성한 놈이라야만 됨니다.<38>
