January and the Full Moon

How happy it should be! During the joyful month of January, in your home, how do you joyfully spend the long night with your family... 

As family ties grow more strained in life, it is essential that just once during the time before the Full Moon, the entire family comes together to enjoy one night happily. Why shouldn't we do that? Whether there are four, five, seven, or eight family members, old persons, women, and children can all gather together without realizing how long the night is, enjoying a brand-new modern "animal racing game” (動物競爭말판) that each person can have.

This is the latest and most beautiful kind of game board, far more delightful than the "Outlook Game Board" (出世말판) from the January issue. By just visiting the gallery for a single moment, you will understand just how good it is, beyond all advertisements of games.

It is excellent for children, but it would be beneficial for you, too, and it is a delight to play with friends whom you meet for the first time.

The game board and newspaper and book can all be obtained for only fifteen jeon (錢)! Just think of it as spending the cost of a single pack of cigarettes. If you send just fifteen jeon to Gyeongseong Kaepuksa (京城開闢社), you will receive all three within a few days.

For details regarding the children's book, please refer to the advertisement found at the back of this volume. <120> 

**Summary**

It highlights both children's enjoyment and the game board's affordability.
