In this issue, on page 64, the article titled "Report on Opium Dens" is one of the competitive exploration reports between the South and North teams of our magazine's journalists. While the South team's journalist was active in the opium den, the North team's journalist explored elsewhere. What findings did he bring forth to provide to the readers... a competitive grand activity! The North team's brilliant exploration report will be published in the March issue.

Readers are invited to compare the South team's opium den article in this issue with the North team's exploration report in the March issue, and then determine which team's journalist performed better and made more insightful selections. Voting will identify the superior team, and prizes will be awarded to the readers who vote for the winning team (detailed regulations will be announced in the March issue).  

**Summary**  

The article discusses an initiative by a magazine to engage its readers by comparing exploration reports conducted by two competing teams, South and North. It not only emphasizes the rivalry between the teams but also invites the readers’ participation in determining which article is superior through a voting system. Historians may find interest in this article as it reflects the competitive journalism environment of the era and how media practices were evolving under colonial influence, revealing insights into the cultural landscape of Korea during Japanese rule.

본호 64페지에 게재한 『阿片窟探査記』는 본지 기자중, 남북 양 특동대의 경쟁적 탐사기사중의 一 이외다. 南隊기자가 아편굴에 활동하는 동안에 北隊기자는 어느 곳에서 무엇을 탐사하엿는지 무슨 수확을 독자의 압헤 제공할넌지...경쟁적 대활동! 北隊의 기발한 탐사기는 삼월호에 게재됨니다.
독자는 본호의 (南隊)阿片窟記事와 삼월호의 北隊探査記를 비교하야 兩隊 중 어느 편 기자가 활동을 잘 하엿는지 재료를 잘 골낫는지 그 우렬을 판단하야 투표하면 그 투표가 만흔 편을 닉인 편으로 정하고 그 편에 투표한 독자에게 상품을 드리는 규정이외다.(상세규정은 삼월호에 발표)<99>
