The announcement is regarding the re-establishment of the Gangneung Branch of the Narae Company (開闢社). The position of the branch is in the Gangneung County (江陵郡), within the Daeshin Township (大正町). 

The branch will be led by Branch Head Choi Bong-kyu (崔鳳圭), with Jo Il-yong (朱一龍) serving as the General Affairs and Reporter, and journalists Choi Uk (崔郁), Jung In-su (鄭寅洙), and Jung Yun-si (鄭允時) on the team. 

This re-establishment highlights the expansion of local media efforts in Gangneung, indicating an increase in the regional dissemination of news and information during this period. 

**Summary**  

This article announces the re-establishment of the Gangneung branch of the Narae Company, signaling a period of expanded regional media presence in Korea. This is particularly interesting in the context of Korean colonial history as it reflects the dynamics of local governance and the attempts to foster a sense of local identity amidst Japanese colonial rule. Historians may find it significant as it showcases the efforts to localize news dissemination and possibly counterbalance centralized narratives.
