Exchange of Old and New Magazines  

The 5th, 7th, and 11th issues of Byeolgeongeun have achieved unprecedented popularity, and as a special order from our overseas compatriots who have recently requested, we announce here that anyone who has the aforementioned issues of the magazine can send them to our company. We express our gratitude while also offering to exchange this month's new magazine or whichever number you prefer. However, the deadline is July 15th.

**Summary**  

This article promotes an exchange program for specific issues of the magazine Byeolgeongeun, inviting readers, especially overseas compatriots, to participate by sending in their copies of past issues in return for a new one or a different desired issue. The appeal highlights the magazine's success and seeks to maintain engagement with its readers during the colonial period. Historians may find the aspect of international readership, even within a colonial framework, significant, as it reflects the shared cultural connections and the ongoing pursuit of Korean identity in exile or under colonial rule.
