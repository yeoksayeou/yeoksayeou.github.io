Gyeongju, as you all know, this year marks the 10th anniversary of our company. As we have been actively looking for branches in various places both at home and abroad, there are no other regions that have been established other than the major areas. Gyeongju is a renowned scenic spot in Korea, and despite its reputation abroad, we regret that our headquarters have not yet established a branch there. Therefore, we particularly announce that those who are interested should consult with our business office by the end of this month.

**Summary**  

This article is an announcement regarding the establishment of a branch office in Gyeongju as part of the 10th anniversary celebrations of the publication. It highlights Gyeongju's significance as a famous tourist location and expresses disappointment over the lack of a local branch, inviting interested individuals to get in touch. From a colonial history perspective, this reflects the efforts of Korean organizations to expand their influence and reach amid the colonial administration, as well as the importance of leveraging cultural heritage for economic development.
