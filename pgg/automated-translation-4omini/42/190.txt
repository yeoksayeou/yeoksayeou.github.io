The Incident of Japan-China Military Conflict: The Course and Consequences of the Manchurian Incident from September 18 to September 24  
                                                                              
It has been ten days since the outbreak of the Japan-China military conflict that began with the blowing up of the South Manchurian Railway, which eventually drew remarkable global attention! During these days, news extras have been ringing in urban areas three or four times a day, while the elderly, women, and children in remote villages have irresponsibly spread rumors of “a war,” not knowing that a serious tension has enveloped the world. Fortunately, we spent a pleasant autumn night unscathed, yet the collective attention and listening of the world is gradually calming down. However, as most people only have newspaper articles, extra editions, or hear-say of vague rumors, they remain unclear about the crucial details, so we, the editorial office, have decided to compile a diary-like account of the events that occurred, in hopes that it will serve as a reference for our dear readers across the globe. (Reporter)  

-September 18-  
◇Around 10:30 PM, Chinese troops stationed at Beida Ying (approximately ten miles north of Shenyang) detonated a bridge on the railway between Shenyang and Changchun at a place called Liutiaogou, leading to the initial spark of the Japan-China military conflict, causing an exchange of fire with Japanese railway guards stationed nearby, which in turn ignited this major global disturbance.

◇Following that, the Japanese garrison in Shenyang quickly summoned troops for emergency preparations while some units deployed by military train to the Liutiaogou area to engage the Chinese troops stationed at Beida Ying. By 1:30 PM on the 19th, they occupied all of Beida Ying, while another unit started artillery bombardment towards the city of Shenyang from around noon, attacking from the western side.

During this time, casualties for Japanese forces totaled seven, while Chinese forces suffered approximately two to three hundred casualties. There were about five hundred Chinese troops within the city, resulting in some minor skirmishes. Four hundred seventy from East Beida Ying surrendered under a white flag.  

◇At midnight, amidst the turmoil, a Liaoning Province negotiation committee member contacted Consul General Hayashi of Japan’s consulate via phone, followed by a personal visit requesting a cessation of hostilities on the Chinese side.

The city of Changchun fell around 2 PM, costing the Japanese forces twenty-eight dead and sixty-two wounded.

**Summary**  

This article details the escalation of military conflict between Japan and China that culminated in the Manchurian Incident of 1931, expressing the swift military actions taken by Japanese forces and the inadequate responses from Chinese leaders. One significant aspect of the report is the early expressions of national consciousness and mobilization of Chinese resistance, indicating a burgeoning sense of identity during a time of crisis. Historians might find the portrayal of common citizens' reactions and how rumors of conflict spread in localities especially revealing, as it highlights the perception of war and its immediate impacts on daily life under colonial rule.
