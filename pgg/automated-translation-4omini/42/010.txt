古調六章  

The mountains are leveled,  

The Dongting Lake (洞庭湖) is vast.  

If the cassia trees (桂樹) were to blossom,  

The moon would shine even brighter,  

I intended this but could not achieve it,  

Therefore, I feel sorrow for it.  

Yi Hwan  

Upon the summit of Mount Tai (泰山),  

I overlook the great sea,  

The heavens and the earth in all directions,  

Are all clear as day.  

The noble spirit of a man,   

I have understood it today.  

Kim Yu-gi  

On Changbai Mountain (長白山), I plant my flag,  

Washing my horse at the Tumen River (豆滿江),  

Who is that gray stone (석은 저선배) elder?  

Is it not one of us?  

On the Lingyan Pavilion (凌煙閣),  

Whose face will be drawn?  

Kim Jong-ri  

On a moonlit night on a quiet mountain island,  

Alone at the watchtower (戍樓),  

With my great sword by my side,  

I ponder with deep sorrow,  

Where does a single sound of the hujia (胡笳) drift,  

Drawing the love of others?  

Yi Sun-sin  

Gathering the seven swords of the world,  

I plan to wield this to subdue (모화) the barbarians,  

The southern savages (南蠻) and the northern Tartars (北狄),  

After having defeated them all,  

I will forge a plow from that metal,  

To cultivate the fields by the river.  

Anonymous  

Chrysanthemum (菊花), how are you?  

After the March (三月) easterly winds pass,  

In the cold autumn (落木寒天),  

You alone have bloomed.  

Perhaps the proud and isolated spirit (傲霜孤節)  

Is only you.  

Lee Ding-bu  

**Summary**  

The poem "Six Old Tunes" features various reflections on landscapes, nature, and the human spirit from a historical perspective, intertwining personal longing with cultural heritage. Each section is attributed to different poets, lamenting lost aspirations and celebrating the beauty of nature against the backdrop of the grand mountains and lakes of Korea. A notable element is Yi Sun-sin's poignant imagery connected to his struggles, indicating the militaristic ethos of the time. Historians may find interest in the representation of nature as a source of personal and national identity during the colonial period.

古調六章
						李浣 외
群山을 削平턴들
洞庭湖 넓을낫다.
桂樹를 버혓던들
달이 더욱 밝을 것을
뜻 두고 이루지 못하니
그를 슬허하노라.

李浣


泰山에 올나안저
大海를 굽어보니
天地四方이
훤츨도 한저이고
丈夫의 浩然之氣
오늘이사 알괘라.

金裕器


長白山에 旗를 꼿고
豆滿江에 말 씻기니
석은 저선배야
우리 아니 사나희냐
엇지타 凌煙閣上에
뉘 얼골을 그릴꼬

金宗璃


閑山섬 달 밝은 밤에
戍樓에 혼자 안저
큰칼 엽헤 차고
기푼 시름 하는데
어대서 一聲胡笳는
남의 애를 끈는니

李舜臣


天下 七首劍을
한대 모화 뷔를 매며
南蠻 北狄을
다 쓰러바린 후에
그 쇠로 호미를 맹그러
江上田을 매리라.

無名氏


菊花야 너는 어이
三月 東風 다 지나고
落木寒天에
너 홀로 퓌엿낫다.
아마도 傲霜孤節은
너뿐인가 하노라.

李鼎輔 ＜3＞
