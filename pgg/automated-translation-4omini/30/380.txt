Ms. Park Seong-hwan of Dongdeok Girls' School has been saving money, saying to others that if she saves like this, she won't have to worry about funeral expenses after death. However, she has recently unfortunately fallen ill and spent all her savings on medical expenses, and now she plans to go to Mount Geumgang for treatment, but without money, she is in a very difficult situation. The savings intended for funeral expenses have all been used for medical treatment. Of course, as a good omen, her illness is expected to fully recover (she is somewhat better now), but if there are benefactors who saved for others' medical expenses, it would be good if they could help her once. <136>
