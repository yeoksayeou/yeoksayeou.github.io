The Pyongyang Kiseong Coupon Office plans to establish a hospital specifically for courtesans in celebration of its 10th anniversary. It stands to reason that the physician at this hospital should specialize in sexually transmitted diseases.  

Recently, Han Il-ho and Haeuk Banks have merged, and the new name should be Han Lake Cooperative Bank, but the authorities changed it to Dong Il Bank because the character Han was deemed unstable. This could easily lead to a situation where Han is referred to as Chosun, and Han mountain jute is changed to Chosun mountain jute.  

It turns out that after the merger, a friend from Japan of Han Sang-ryong, a Han Bank officer, sent New Year's greetings referring to him as Chosun Sang-ryong.  

The individual who attempted to assassinate Prime Minister Hamaguchi, Sato Takeya, is reported to be of Chosun descent. One can speculate whether bloodlines from unsavory Koreans remain here, as the term designating him could well suggest "Unsavory Korean-born Japanese youth."  

They say the situation regarding the prime minister's assassination didn’t worsen. A youth of 27 named Suzuki Toramatsu from Akita heard this news and was so enraged that he committed suicide. Perhaps this was related to the headlines from the recent Taiwan incident, as he was a top student of a principal who may have been misled.  

Looking at the military expenditure forecast comparison table of major powers for the next year, Italy stands at 24% of its total budget, France at 22%, the United States at 21%, the United Kingdom at 15%, and Japan occupies first place in the world at 24%.  

However, in Chosun, even a regiment of roughly 200 infantry has been completely disbanded, resulting in cuts to the budget by 240,000 won. Thus, it seems Chosun is in a position to hold the first place in military reduction on a global scale, which is a rather startling contrast.  

Namgang Lee Seung-hoon has a will stating that his remains should be kept at a school, which has led to quite a complex situation. Conversely, Han Gyu-han has made a simpler will regarding arrangements for his funeral. It seems that a will can be differently assessed depending on the individual and place.  

In Tokyo, a major incident known as the Daisenkiyu happened centered around Waseda University. Perhaps this is due to the lack of advance investigations, similar to how things are in Chosun.  

During the recent meeting of the Shin Kankai Central Committee, students present to observe were taken to the police station. If they had entered the organization, at least they would have been sent to the prosecutor's office.  

While other regions are facing minor issues such as tax reductions and reductions in teacher salaries, the Kyŏngsŏng Province has decided to raise household taxes and school fees by 30%.  

Could it be that people who live abundantly are unaware of civilian issues, pondering what it means to increase taxes rather than reduce the salaries of high-ranking teachers? However, could such complaints even be expressed? Where do all these high-ranking teachers come from?  

In Shizuoka Prefecture, a disaster has occurred, leading to significant losses in human life and infrastructure. Fortunately, the damage is less than that from the Tokyo earthquake. The formation of vigilante groups has been fortunate for the many compatriots who remain here.  

Due to budget tightening, even the prison inmates' meals have reportedly been reduced. At this rate, they may even start agriculture in hellish environments. <115>  

**Summary**  

The article discusses various events and issues in Korea and Japan during a time of colonial rule, touching on the establishment of a hospital for courtesans, changes in banking names due to political pressures, and military budget comparisons. It highlights the disbandment of troops in Korea, juxtaposing it with excessive military spending in Japan while addressing societal concerns such as increased taxes and public sentiments involving suicide incidents. Historians may find the references to social injustice and the tensions arising from colonial rule particularly revealing of the complexities of life in occupied Korea.

吸烟室
平壤箕城券番에서는 創立 10주년 기념으로 妓生專用病院을 設立하기로 計劃한다고. 그러면 그 病院醫師는 花柳病 專門醫師라야 되겟지.

이번에 韓一 湖西 兩銀行이 合同되는데 새 명칭을 韓湖協同銀行이라 하럇더니 當局에서 韓字가 不穩타 하야 결국 東一銀行으로 改稱하얏다지. 그러다가는 韓氏를 朝鮮氏, 韓山苧를 朝鮮山苧라고 改稱하기도 쉬울 것.

안인게 안이라 合倂 卽後에 漢銀의 韓相龍을 엇던 日本 친구가 朝鮮相龍이라고 年賀狀에 * 일도 잇섯지.

濱口首相의 狙擊犯人 佐鄕屋留雄은 朝鮮胎生이라고 한다. 不逞鮮人의 피가 或 遺傳이나 되지 안엇는지 그 名辭를 짓자면 曰 不逞鮮産日本靑年이다.

首相狙擊의 말이 낫스니 말이지. 秋田懸 鈴木虎松이란 當年 27세의 청년은 이 소식을 듯고 悲憤自縊하엿다지. 요전 臺灣事件의 소식을 듯고 놀나 失眞한 학교장의 首弟子이나 안인가?

明年度 列强國의 軍事費豫算 比較表를 보면 伊太利는 全豫算의 24%, 佛國은 22%, 米國은 21%, 英國은 15%, 日本은 24%로 世界首位를 占하얏다.

그런데 朝鮮에는 200명 내외의 步兵隊까지 아주 解散 식히게 되야 그 예산 24만원을 削除한다고. 그리고 보면 軍備縮少로는 朝鮮이 세계의 首位니 天下好對照로군.

南岡 李昇薰氏는 遺骨을 학교에 보관하라는 遺言이 잇슴으로 因하야 문제가 퍽 복잡하게 되더니 韓圭卨氏는 訃告도 말고 喪輿도 四人밤상을 쓰란 유언을 하야 일이 아주 간단하게 되엿다. 가튼 遺言이라도 인물과 京鄕을 따러 判異한가.

東京에서도 早大를 중심으로 하야 大盟休 사건이 발생하얏다. 아마 朝鮮에서처럼 미리 檢擧를 안이한 까닭이겟지.

이번에 열인 新幹會 中央委員會에는 학생이 傍聽을 하다가 警察署까지 불녀갓다가 왓다. 傍聽을 갓기에 그럿치 만일 入會를 하엿더면 적어도 檢事局은 갓다올 걸.

다른 곳에서는 稅金 減下니 敎員 俸給 減下니 하는 문제가 작구 이러나는 판에 京城府는 그와 正反對로 戶別稅 學校費를 3할 增收하기로 되엿다지.

아모리 배부르게 편이 안저 먹는 천부지의 인물들이기로 民間 事情을 그다지 몰은단 말인가 稅金 增收보다도 高級老廢物의 敎員 俸給을 減下함이 如何. 그러나 그런 말은 될 번이나 할 말이냐 高級 敎員이 다 어느 곳 사람들이기에.

靜靜岡縣에서는 震災가 이러나 人畜의 死傷 建物의 破壞 등 손해가 莫大하엿다. 그래도 東京 震災에 比하야 손해가 적은 것이 幸이어니와 自警團 안이 생긴 것도 在留同胞의 多幸이다.

예산 긴축하는 바람에 監獄囚의 콩밥까지도 줄게 되엿다 한다. 그러다가는 벼루기 잔등에 火田起耕도 할걸. <115>
