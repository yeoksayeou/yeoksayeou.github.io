4) New Year's Bonus Day

5) City Couple <111>  

In the bustling streets during the end of the year, the atmosphere reflects economic hardships faced by many. We see vendors struggling to sell their goods, their faces filled with distress as they lower their prices in hopes of attracting customers. 

Street performers, once lively and entertaining, now find their audience scarce, with only a few passersby showing interest. The cheerful chatter associated with holiday shopping is replaced by an air of uncertainty, as families calculate their dwindling finances. 

Meanwhile, a couple walks hand in hand, embodying the juxtaposition of hope and despair in these challenging times. Though they strive to maintain a sense of normalcy, their weary expressions reveal the burden of economic instability weighing heavily on them. 

The hopes for a prosperous New Year linger in the air, yet the reality of financial struggles looms large, painting a stark picture of society at this time. 

**Summary**  

This article vividly portrays the economic struggles of individuals during the year-end festivities in 1930. The cartoon captures the contrast between the season's cheer and the reality of financial distress, illustrating how deeply the economic situation affected everyday life. Historians might find it particularly revealing as it reflects not only the immediate impact of economic hardship on the population but also provides insight into the societal sentiments and cultural practices of colonial Korea during this period.
