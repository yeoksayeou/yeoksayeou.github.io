Question and Answer Record (5)  

When I was in prison, what was the first hardship you faced?  

The first hardship was the lack of toilet paper (紙). In prison, everyone knows that the basic food served is rice and beans (콩밥), which can easily upset the stomach, and toilet paper is given only in a very limited amount daily. If one has diarrhea, that hardship becomes even more evident. <35>  

**Summary**  

This section highlights the difficult conditions faced in prison, particularly the lack of basic sanitary supplies like toilet paper, compounded by the poor quality of food which often results in stomach issues. This stark portrayal of hardship sheds light on the living conditions during the colonial period in Korea, revealing how ordinary prisoners experienced additional suffering due to inadequate resources. Historians may find the mention of such daily struggles indicative of the broader theme of oppression under colonial rule.
