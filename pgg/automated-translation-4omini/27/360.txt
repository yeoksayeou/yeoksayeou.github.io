The rain that takes away spring—are the tears of parting? The rain continues to fall persistently all day long. It seems to take the sorrow of the rainy season away; it has entered without permission. 

Nonetheless, how tormenting is the rain, causing a lingering sound of affection in this old spring day! Just how greatly this rain can scatter the hearts of many young people! 

Even if the day were clear, there wouldn't be much to do, yet my heart can’t help but feel gloomy like a person unable to go under the rain curtain. Even thinking about it, I can’t find a way to deceive my heart; it is a frustrating matter. 

On rainy days, the boarding house feels strangely dark and lonely. Although I generally have no attachment to my hometown, on rainy days, I always feel a pang of nostalgia. I closed the books and stepped out to the veranda; the walls of the main house are wet, and through the fence, I can see the neighboring house drenched in rain. 

With the narrow gap, I peer outside and can see the green trees in the yard. Among them, there is one young tree that doesn't grow green even in spring; I thought it was dead, but these days, it suddenly appears to have figured out spring and it has grown remarkably large with water. New green! The new green that dresses the old spring! 

When this new green extends its delicate and small hand to me, it gives me a light yet profound charm that intoxicates the soul. 

Having just experienced the rain, I went out to Chwiundang (翠雲亭) with the new green. The sounds of rain falling around me and the sight of the green rain is enchanting. I stood there in a daze as if drunk, with all my distracting thoughts flying away, my heart feels hollowed out, like a large rubber pouch that can hold conversations. 

After returning to reality, the sound of rain and the sight of green remains with me. No matter how I look at it, this new green never loses its vibrance. It is also a new green that, without a word of complaint, blooms while it is drenched in rain. 

It is a new green that tempts even a weary heart. The new green, soaked in rain, shines bright and the leaves have multiplied; not long from now, green shadows will be fluttering above.

However, for those oppressed people filled with resentment and bitterness, it seems that the spring rain still brings no relief this year. 

Once again, my heart feels hollow and a large rubber pouch remains with me.

**Summary**

The article expresses deep feelings evoked by the rain in spring, using it as a metaphor for parting, nostalgia, and the bittersweet reality of life during a time of personal and national strife. The author contrasts the vibrant new green of life with the loneliness felt in the rain, reflecting a connection to hidden depths of sorrow. Historians might find significance in the symbolic use of nature, where the imagery of the new green amidst rain can raise discussions about the emotional states during the colonial period.

봄을앗기는이별의눈물인지-비는왼종일한결가티나리고잇다。 장마비와도가티 쉬일새업시나리고잇다。
그럿치안어도 괴롬만코 설홈만흔 이에 애련한소리를내이며 나리는 늙은봄날의이비는 얼마나만흔젊은이의마음을散亂케하는지!
날이맑엇단들 갈곳이야 별로잇섯스랴만은 비문에못가는것처럼 마음한편이가비얍지가못하다。 그럿케라도생각하야 내마음을속일수밧게업스니말이다 야속한일이다。
비오는날 下宿집이란 별하게도 음산하고쓸쓸하다 내별로 고향에애착이업건만은 비오는날만은 늘-鄕愁에마음을조리고잇는것이다。 보든책을덥허놋코 문을열고 대청에나섯다 첨하와 담장이맛붓고 건넛집집웅이담장압헤맛다은 안탑갑게도붓흔 이집은 亦是 구름백힌 하눌이나마도 볼수엄다。
그좁은틈으로 부비여 내다보면 엽집에잇는 푸른나무가보인다。 그중에도귀달한느틔(?)나무하나는봄이되여도 푸르지를안키에 죽은줄로만알엇드니 요사이에는 늣게 봄을알엇슬망정 남못지안케닙히크고 물이올낫다。 新綠! 늙은봄을 치장하는新綠이!
이 아양부리며 조고마한 손을 내밀어 내마음을잇다하면 新綠은 輕快하면서도 은근한 큰 魅力을가지고 사람을醉하게한다。
雨備를 갓초고 新綠을차저翠雲亭으로올나갓다。
들니는것은비소래요 뵈이는것은푸른빗이다。 술취한것처럼 멍-하니서잇섯다。 뒤숭숭하든생각이 다어데로달아낫는지 오직마음이텡뷔여잇슬이다。 수업시담을수잇는 큰고무주머니가남어잇슬이다。
