劇詩三篇(押韻)  

Ⅰ A hundred and thirty coins  
Living in despair, the son has fled at night.  
Though the vast Manchuria is alive, what is the use?  
How pitiful is the child born of an unmarried woman?  
I give him thirty coins,  
But who will recognize him as someone who died away from home?  

Ⅱ What friends  
Escaping is forcibly and everything is a joy,  
Since I can’t spend money freely, it looks like a shame.  
Captured by the overseer, shall I enjoy myself?  
To eat, wear, and live is just the usual way.  

Ⅲ Night Scene (Seoul's)  
In every alley, there is Lee Doryoung and Seong Chunghyang,  
The gourd-shaped shadows stretch long.  
Though my love and your love are small,  
East, West, North, and South, all hearts are varied.  

- 1930.4.28 -

劇詩三篇(押韻)
						金岸曙
Ⅰ 一金參拾錢也
살길업서 得男이 夜間逃亡 하드니
넓은滿洲 살진들 客死라니 가엽지。
홀애자식 參拾錢 내돈아주 는걸
客死안야 卽死-ㄴ들 녀석일을 뉘알리。

Ⅱ 엇던 親故
도피고 날조와 모다興겹다
맘대로 돈못쓰니 모양안인것
마지기 잡혀다 놀아볼가
먹고입고 살거야 依例잇는것。

Ⅲ 小夜景(서울의)
골목마다 李道令 成春香아씨
가즈란이 그림자 길게늘이고
내사랑 네사랑은 소군거려도
東西南北 마음은 모다각가지。
-一九三〇‧四‧二八-
