Modern Fortune House

Four-sided Love

The age to transform lumbering industries! The burning heat is gradually melting away! 

New forms of marriage such as friendly marriage, experimental marriage, visiting marriage, etc., are emerging and creating new grooms and brides in this society where one can freely engage in marriage. Among them is the extraordinarily created modern marriage style called shared marriage!

The protagonist is Shimizu Uda (清水歌子), a twenty-year-old Japanese virgin who operates a small tea shop in the Kanda district of Tokyo. Uda, who normally serves tea to her customers, at some point seduced a wealthy student and, since last autumn, became the lover of three students from a certain private university, successively forming relationships with them. However, this four-sided relationship, which has one more angle than a triangle, surprisingly did not result in any disturbances or tragedies. Upon the vigorous proposal of this energetic woman, starting from February of this year, it was agreed that each of the three would cover a living expense of fifty yen per month, and they entered a hotel in Zushi to share a room, with each lover taking turns to stay with the mistress and maintaining their romantic time while still attending school. However, the police did not leave the four-sided situation alone. The soldiers of morality! With their relentless intervention, they ruthlessly tore apart this foolish romantic escapade.

In a triangle there are breakdowns and disturbances! In a four-sided relationship, there is police interference! Oh! In love, the abundant angles do not bring fortune at all! 

Can sexual relationships develop in any form!? 

**Summary**

This article explores the dynamics of a newly emerging form of marriage called "shared marriage," reflecting on the complex romantic entanglements of a young woman and three male lovers in pre-war Japan. The narrative not only captures the shifting sentiments toward love and relationships in 1930s Japan but also hints at the societal constraints imposed by moral authorities, as represented by police intervention. Historians may find this depiction of modern relationships significant within the context of Japan's colonial experience and the evolving roles of women, showcasing early expressions of sexual freedom amidst traditional constraints.
