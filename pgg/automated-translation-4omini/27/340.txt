New Green and I  
						Ch'oe So-hae  
My house is on the other side of the main street of Seon-ui Palace. As I step out of the gate, there is a cabbage patch no bigger than a cat. To the left of that patch, it leads to a small creek. It is right there at the main street of Seon-ui Palace, where the water flowing from Inwangsan mountain mingles with the well water we drink in our village, flowing gently, drop by drop. In that creek, there is an old willow tree with loosely hanging branches like threads. The branches, dyed light green, are swaying in the spring breeze, and I just now noticed this. By the way, a child, having made too much noise while cooking, went out to the street and I saw this. This is a truth that seems like a lie. It has only been two years since I moved to this village, but it seems as if I have seen those willow branches since yesterday afternoon. Is it because my heart feels the weight of labor? Or is it that I have become indifferent? In any case, it was only yesterday that I saw the willow branches that were so close to home. I cannot dismiss the existence of this world as if I were unacquainted with it. 

Calmly, I breathe in the gentle morning dawn, my heart sways with an affectionate reverence as I observe the tender sprouts, like a child cupping them in their hands. The blue mists of Bukak mountain and the shimmering heat at the summit of Inwangsan all feel like I am seeing them for the first time. The nature is blossoming like this. The old tree has grown leaves. Still, I remain oblivious. I, without a sense of the seasons, what should I do? Yet, thinking upon it, the existence of a human who understands the seasons is the rarest thing in the world. What has blocked my ears and veiled my eyes? I nestled into my heart and fondled the gentle smile of the child that arose, and I again beheld the verdant world flowing splendidly. Do these faces awaken the seasons? But what will these things become in the future? 

**Summary**  

In "New Green and I," Ch'oe So-hae reflects on the beauty of nature and the simple life surrounding his home by the main street of Seon-ui Palace. He paints a vivid picture of the environment, emphasizing the interconnectedness of nature and sentimentality of human experience. The article's introspective nature and intimate observations about the seasons can indicate a longing for authenticity and connection in a rapidly changing world, revealing the complexities of existence during Korea's colonial period. Historians might find interest in how the author captures the subtle beauty of life amidst the challenges of oppression, expressing a deep sense of belonging and introspection that speaks to the human condition.
