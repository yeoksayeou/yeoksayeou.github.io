New Green... and Others 

Spring is emerging from the old seat of decay as the new leaves begin to sprout. 

The white birch and willows are starting to show signs of age. 

The sun shines through the gaps, igniting the vast fog with clear light, making it sparkle like fine rain. 

On the streets, the cheeks of young maidens blossom with a faint, rosy flush, and the branches, laden with new growth, flutter in the gentle breeze. New green... the woman of new green is a beautiful landscape painting. 

◇ At Seongyukjeong 

It was meant to be a spring farewell, but it turned into rain. 

As I dipped my brush into the flowers, the azaleas don’t bloom; the green of the grass has been washed a long time ago. 

The peach trees are in full blossom, drenched in the rain, bowing their heads elegantly, while the fresh green peaches are like the pure and graceful maiden of youth. 

Standing in the sandlot, a woman is cooking rice, seemingly forgetting the troubles of the day. 

Seongyukjeong is also drenched in rain, silently gazing at the flowing waters below. 

The worried young ones hold back their tears. 

However, those tears rising from the past are not uncommon; the youth carry their sorrows… 

Not all youths are burdened with sorrow, and while the sorrow of youth may be the sweet sorrow of spirited spring, it is burdensome—yet tears that overflow from the torment only taste bitter, worse than the pain of a dry mouth. 

◇ So-called Worries 

It has been said that living until seventy is rare. 

To live without being marked by age and not to see seventy, in this modern age, is just a foolish ambition for those who wish to fulfill their desires. 

In this world, every desire has a conversation with each individual, but the path ahead is laden with excess. 

The world, existing solely for oneself, only leads one to chase after wealth and fame, making tens of thousands suffer with no reward. 

Everything in this world has limits and extent. To understand these limits and extent, one must yearn for the new. 

Even among people, three thirty-year-olds cannot compare to one person aged a hundred… 

Among those burdened with worries, it is hard to find one in a hundred who has not experienced such worries because of the inability to search for enlightenment.  

**Summary**  

This article expresses the beauty of spring through vivid imagery while reflecting on the fleeting nature of youth and the burdens of desires that plague modern life. It juxtaposes the fresh vibrancy of nature with the sorrows and worries of young people. Historians might find the depiction of young people's emotional struggles during the colonial period particularly insightful, revealing the psychological toll of societal expectations and desires amidst the political and social transformations of 1930s Korea.

新綠……其他
						白菱
봄이늙은 자리에서 初錄의 새잎이 도다올은다。
이미 욱어진 白楊과 垂楊은 발서老틔가난다。
해츤 빈틈엄시 살이지고 하날에는 浩蕩하든 안개가 버서지어 맑은빗치돈다。
길에나선 處女들의 볼에는 아렴풋 고흔紅潮가 피어올으고 거름거리는 나무가지에 갓도든 닙히 ■■■노니듯이 가분가분하다。 新綠……新綠의女人은 고흔風景畵다。

◇洗劍亭에서
餞春 을하려나온것이 비를마지하엿다。
花전을 붓치자니 杜鵑은 저서업고 척축이 한참이다。
앵도는 자리만남고 복사치제철이다。
새간紅桃가 비에저저 고개를숙인樣은 妖艶하기 이업고 해맑은 碧桃는 喪청의靑孀美人갓다。
砂場에 솟틀걸고 밥짓는 연긔가 구진한울로 하욤업시 소사올은다。
洗劍亭도 비에잠겨 묵묵히 압내를 굽어본다。
시름만흔젊운이는 눈물을린다。
그러나녯그린 눈물은안이다 젊은이는 젊은이의서름이잇느니……。
젊은이라고 다 서름이잇슴이 안이겟고 젊은이의서름도 고흔靑春의 서름이야 정다운 과도가티 달고한가하겟지만 괴로웁다못하여(搾)여올으는 눈물은 맛조차쓰다……소태보담도-

◇所謂근심
人生七十이 古來稀라고하엿다。 七十을다못살고 形跡업시 살아저바리는 人生이 當代에제홀로 제慾心 살어보겟다고 애를 쓰는것이 都是망녕이다。
世上은 慾心만흔 한사람 한사람과 말대ㅅ구를 하고섯기에는 갈길이 넘우도밧부다。
世上이 저하나만을爲하야 잇는것으로만녁여 돈을 게집을 功名을 마음 차지하려고 萬人契를 으려들다가 허덕허덕쓸어지고는만다。
世上의 모든것은 限과度가잇다。 이 限과度를 맛처가자면 世上은 새것을 바란다。 사람으로하더래도 百歲의한사람보담 三十歲의 세사람을……
근심만타는 사람中에 萬人契를 타지못하여그근심이 생기지안이한사람은 百에 한둘이잇기 어려웁다。
