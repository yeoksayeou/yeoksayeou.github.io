Tragedy of a Spring Day  

On a gentle evening,  
where has this come from?  
A few little children,  
perched on the red brick wall,  
caught in a spider's web,  
they are tangled in it.  

Do I hate the spider's web?  
Shall I blow it away in the spring breeze?  
The children look sideways at the angry spider,  
bringing the sound of the falling petals!  

Endure! How can I leave this spider's web?  
It looks like my soul, my beloved, watching me.  
I take my hands and tear it down!

**Summary**  

The poem reflects on the painful tragedy that unfolds in a peaceful spring setting, where children unknowingly become entangled in a spider’s web, symbolizing perhaps the inescapable nature of suffering and entrapment in life. This imagery serves to evoke feelings of sympathy and a strong sense of connection to the fragility of innocence. Historians might find interest in how such imagery subtly critiques social conditions during the colonial period in Korea, showcasing the fragility and entrapment experienced by individuals under the oppressive forces of colonization.

봄날의 悲劇
						로아
바람부드러운 저녁나절
어데서 불려온겐지
두셋 네다섯 앳분 닙이
붉은벽돌담 걸터안즌
왕거미줄에 걸려 ᆯ고잇다네
거미줄 미웁달가
봄바람 나물할가
닙흘겨보고 성난거미
락화의설음을 몰으는구나!
참아! 어이두고가랴 거미줄
내얼골 내살님 보는듯십허
단장들어 내손으로 헐고돌아섯네
