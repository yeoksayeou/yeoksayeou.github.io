In the aftermath of a heartbreak, the suffering woman's mind ignites with a fierce, unquenchable fire of rage. As if all the blood in her body had boiled over, she could no longer contain herself and rushed into the streets. The cruel nature of her revenge was such that not even the tiniest hint of remorse was present in her eyes as she glared at the lovers walking joyfully together through the gate of the flower school, their pretty hair adorned with the morning dew of spring. This was the lover who had betrayed her and thrown himself into the arms of another woman. In her fury, she lunged at him like a wild beast, fiery light burning in her eyes, gripping his hair fiercely, striking without restraint, and spitting on his face... The helpless and fragile girl, caught in this unforeseen assault, had no means of resistance. Having consumed a little Japanese beauty product, her cheeks turned instantly red. Her skirt was torn, and her hair was disheveled... However, the principal, Kim ○○, who had rushed to the scene, was so astonished that no one would dare to speak or even walk past. There was no murmuring among the onlookers, each frozen by shock. Was it that people’s nerves had been dulled to the point of indifference, or were they too fatigued by the struggles of life? One thing was certain: the girl's methods of revenge were barbaric and clumsy. How could she not understand that once a girl's heart has turned, there is no way to win it back? Crying and throwing tantrums won’t change anything! It would be better to have a more enlightened and liberated view of life and love! Such madness is best forgotten...

Recently, it is said that Parisian ladies have been fervently dyeing their nails... They would quip, "What’s so special about that? We have been dyeing our nails with bougainvillea since ages past." However, being Parisian, with fine waists to flaunt, the beautiful women would dye them in vibrant colors of blue, yellow, red, green, and gold to match the ornamental combs they wore. Just a while back, an aristocrat’s wife showcased her golden nails paired with shimmering gold combs. Upon first glance, it looked like pure gold, but it turned out to be fine gold threads. After that, orders for golden and silver combs surged, and now the comb market is thriving, almost in a frenzy. To us, suffering from a gold deficiency, who would afford it? But since it costs over five hundred won, how many courageous souls are there who could actually buy it…? Still, it's such a trendy notion...

An artist once stumbled into a tiny inn in Cheongjin-dong, Seoul, while on his way to France. Upon introduction from a friend, he found the place rather ominous and alluring like a den of devils, unable to turn away. Upon the proprietor's guidance, he took a room and began unpacking, when by a strange twist of fate, he found himself in a room adjoining that of a female student. Simply seeing her shoes neatly lined up by the thin wall provided an unexpected comfort. He felt a vague sense of foreboding that something would soon occur, leading to the events of that very night. 

That night, a soft voice pleading "Please forgive me" gently opened the artist’s door.  

"Who is it?"  

"It is me, please lend me a newspaper."  

"We have no newspapers."  

"Then if you could lend me a novel..."  

"We have no novels either!"  

With no invitation, the female student apologized and closed the door. Each night before sleep, the murmurings spilled forth from the adjacent room, an intense and rapid discussion centered around the fate of protagonists in newspaper novels. Occasionally, they would hear bubbling laughter from the woman's room as they curled up in their blankets. This is what the ‘Street School Girl’ is becoming: ‘street’ refers to the ‘street’ and sounds similar to ‘fake’, carrying a meaning that resonates. If they recklessly drift in Seoul, one should watch out for being assigned as a teacher at a boarding school. They might be seen as a jobless individual, but for those who can’t afford that, caution is necessary!

**Summary**

This article presents a caustic critique of a woman's unfortunate path to revenge following heartbreak, reflecting on societal norms regarding love and emotional fragility. It illustrates a struggle against societal expectations and personal turmoil, through the metaphor of a girl's futile attempts at reclaiming love with barbaric actions. This perspective might intrigue historians studying the impact of colonial social structures on personal identity and emotional expressions among women in 1930s Korea.
