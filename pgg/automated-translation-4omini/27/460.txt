It seems just like yesterday when we visited the cherry blossoms, and now it is already the端陽佳節 (Chunyang Festival) when the cherries ripen beautifully. While it was a delightful sight to see the cherry blossoms at 玉窓 (Okjo) without any sadness, our feelings upon seeing the cherries ripen at the 社窓 (Sahwa) were indeed more profound.  

Next month's issue marks the 10th anniversary of our publication. Not only will it have many pages, but esteemed writers who have contributed since the first issue will also take the lead, creating a grand spectacle, the first of its kind since magazines began in Korea. We hope that you will share in the excitement with our staff as we celebrate this 10th anniversary issue, and we also look forward to your kind readership. (Cha)  

At this point, in addition to our magazine work, we have decided to establish a correspondence system to foster closeness between the 開闢社 (Gaebyeoksa) and our readers. We will also write to you frequently, and we welcome you to write back without hesitation, providing encouragement or advice, or discussing matters together. (Choi)  

As for this editorial note, I would like to share one last memory: On a certain day in the pleasant spring, the staff went to the vicinity of彰義門 (Changui Gate) for a picnic.  

We cooked rice outdoors, made soup, and had quite a lively time.  

Mr. Cha was engrossed in making a minari (water parsley) woven cap, while Mr. Bang was fussing around with his outfit worried about the wind. Mr. Ro, while trying to make a Gyeongsang-do style dish, ended up failing miserably, bringing much embarrassment to himself.  

Regardless of our skills, it was said that there would be a feast on that day. We inquired about the weather at the meteorological station, and what do you know? It poured! Even the meals we prepared ourselves were quite decent, though. One little secret to share:  

Mr. Park was seen covered in flour, and drenched from the rain, while Mr. Choi went to borrow a roof from someone else's house, got caught in the downpour, and ended up shedding tears. (Kim)  

**Summary**  

This article reflects on the transitions from the springtime cherry blossom season to the lush festival of cherries, and highlights the forthcoming 10th-anniversary special issue of the magazine. It underscores community engagement through letters to the editorial team while recapturing a light-hearted picnic experience, revealing the camaraderie among the staff. Such moments document both personal joys and the societal context under colonial rule, emphasizing the complexity of cultural life during the era, which historians may find significant in understanding social dynamics and leisure activities during Japanese occupation.
