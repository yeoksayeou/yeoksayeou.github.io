New Trends in Russian Literature - Entering Pastoral Literature  
無笑生  
As a person of shallow knowledge and broad insight, I find great courage to take up the pen at the request of my elder brother.  

As you all know, the historical event known as the World War has had a tremendous influence on today's material and spiritual lives of humanity, particularly in Europe, where it caused a lamentable struggle among humanity. This history manifests itself in all forms and is seen across today's human life in fields such as novels, poetry, and cinema.  

Indeed, in examining the literary trends after this great war, we can see that within the realm of spiritual expression, the most impactful trend that stimulates our thoughts and dominates the overall thought of modern humanity is "Internationalism."  

Wise readers in Korea will remember that just months ago, a soldier of Germany, driven by heroic spirit and fervor for his motherland, rallied under the army's command and fought against whom? In this war, the realization has emerged that among the elements of humanity who engage in bloodshed, the enemy is not just a foreign army but rather all those unfortunate brothers who share in this misery together.  

In this, the soldiers began to merge into the current of Internationalist thought, expressing great human power, influencing the realms of drama, novels, and poetry that have inspired our spirits.  

This overwhelming "power," which has now spread across Germany, Russia, France, and England, has compelled the ruling classes to gradually yield their places to this new class of rural protagonists.  

Dear readers, please read the works of the remarkable figures in Russian literary history, such as "Gogol's" "Evening on a Farm Near Dikanka" and "Lev Tolstoy's" "The Landlord's Morning."  

Here, one can discover the entire breadth of primitive peasant life that satisfies the landlord's leisurely lifestyle.  

You might find that the native folklore and primitive beliefs of "love" create a unique atmosphere in their lives even when confined to the domain of their nation.  

If you read the serene poetry of rural life, such as "May Night Tales," you will find the innovation of landowners intermingled with the grief of the peasantry.  

However, amid this rural setting, where landlords have long ruled, there exist peasants, and in front of the church that symbolizes the sacred rural life, revolutionary theater performances known as "mandate documents" can be seen, welcoming warm greetings from workers in Germany to farmers in France as they await the Labor Festival.  

What had once served as a refuge for the derelict of superstition and love has now transformed into a resting place for laborers and a factory for the new construction.  

Here, we can discover the new world outlook of a class-based internationalism. Today's literature is that of the estate literature, and though focused on the peculiar feudal expressions of the landowner, the new rural literature signifies a march towards the collective construction of human life.  

The estate in today's context is no longer an isolated rural setup, interwoven with cities and evolving beyond mere idyllic pastoral poetry that characterized past poets. The emergence of new classes began to take note of this primitive rural life and began to sing and narrate the construction of a new village.  

Here is where we may find the new path of human progress that we can discover, relating to a great awakening of human consciousness, backdroped by this new construction.  

Only in a village that had once been feudal property can we symbolize the most advanced aspects of modern humanity with foundations for scientific construction and reveal a side of collective human life in today’s open rural Russia.  

This collective construction may symbolize the new cultural creation, which denotes a novel lifestyle for humanity harmonizing with the rhythmic pulsations of a newly arising era.  

In this sense, the greatest challenge of modern societal construction is to reconcile the emerging culture from rural life with urban development—an inevitable phenomenon resulting from societal evolution, where the shared culture represents a literary position that aptly symbolizes the new trends in humanity's journey.  

The author "Evdokimov" has illustrated the establishment of a new human estate in his novel "Bell," while "Shorokhov" has depicted our new human direction in "The Peaceful Don."  

While the literature of the past was that of a local estate culture, the literary output of today’s Russia resonates with the greater human narrative and the new objectives of human life construction, reinforcing shared trends in constructing human coexistence and the cutting-edge inclinations of new literature.  

**Summary**  

This article discusses the shift in Russian literature towards representing rural life within the context of Internationalism following World War I. The author illustrates how this literary evolution reflects a shared human struggle transcending national boundaries, highlighting key figures and works in Russian literary history. From a Korean colonial history perspective, this discourse on Internationalism serves as a poignant reminder of the interconnectedness of struggles fought against imperial forces, which is particularly relevant given Korea's own colonial situation during this period. Historians might find it fascinating how these literary currents both document and influence nationalist sentiments during times of upheaval.

露西亞文學의新傾向 -田園文學에로進出-
						無笑生
淺見한博識한 제가 兄의부탁은밧앗스나 結局 最大勇氣를내여 붓을드럿슴니다。
여러분도다아시다십히 저世界大戰이라고하는 歐羅巴의慘憺한人類의싸홈歷史는 今日의人類의物的生活乃至精神生活에至大한影響을주엇다고볼수가잇슴니다。
이싸홈의歷史는모든形式을通하야 今日의吾等人類生活의市場가운데出現하고잇섯슴니다。한小說로 詩로, 映畵로 모든人類生活의 分野를通하야볼수잇슴니다。
然히 吾等이 이人類大戰後의文學的傾向을보건대確實히 그精神表現分野中에서이즐수업시 吾等의頭腦을刺戟하고 現代人類의全思潮를支配하고할수밧게는업는「인터나쇼날主義」-이것임니다。
아마 賢明한우리朝鮮의讀者諸氏는 멧個月前에는 母國을爲한다는 英雄的氣魂과 感激으로將軍의命令下에出戰하엿든獨逸의一軍人은 나와서도리켜누구문에 싸웟고 무엇문에 軍人同志사이에 아니 다가튼人類의分子間에流血의戰爭이 오게되는가를生覺아니치못하게 되엿슴니다。
어제지 健壯하든快活하든一靑年이 이慘酷하고무서운 戰爭으로부터不具者가되여 도라와 늙은 어마님兄弟를對할 自己自身을不具로맨든것이 敵軍이아니요 이모든不幸이自己만이맛보는 不幸이아니요 世界人類의不幸이요 설음이라고하고 스스로人類의可憎할形狀을미워하게되엿슴니다。
그들의압헤는敵의兵卒이결코敵이아니엿고 다갓치 不幸한兄弟엿슴니다。
이가튼 인터나쇼날主義思潮에合流하고 굿세이고 偉大한人間力의表現主義를基礎로하야 그얼마나만히演劇 小說, 詩歌가 이섧업은 우리들의가삼을놀게하엿슴니?
이굴근黑線으로새로운時代를謳歌하는人間力의表現分野는 只今지封鎖되엿든 人類生活의 시커먼心臟의피를온世界에ᆷ엇슴니다。
이偉大한「力」은 獨逸에도 露西亞에도 佛蘭西에도 英國에도蔓延케되엿든것임니다。
只今지人類를支配하랴든 아니 數十萬의軍隊와 아니數千의農奴를지배하든 君主階級은 農村의主人公은 次第로 새로운階級에 自己의자리를 옴기여주는수밧게업게되엇슴니다。
讀者 여러분 露西亞文學歷史上에 업지못할人物이라고하는「고-고리」의「되칸되카農村마을의저녁빗」이라든지「녯날의地主들」이라든지「톨쓰토이」라고하는文豪의「地主의앗츰」이라는이약이를 읽어보십시오。
이곳에는 地主의앗츰散步와 이地主의慈悲한生活에滿足할름인原始的農民生活의全幅을發見할수가잇슴니다。
民族的俚言과 原始的迷信의「사랑」이 그들의生活을굿게 自己國民生活領域만에서도 封鎖되엿든感이잇슴을發見할수가잇슬것입니다。
「五月夜話」가튼靜閑한農村의詩를읽어보신다면 그곳에는 地主의開拓이잇고 農奴의설음이 잇섯슬름이올시다。
그러나 이갓흔封鎖되엿든地主萬能의農村에는 어느돗 農民一撥가생기고 神聖하다든農村의 敎會堂門前에는「만다-트(委任狀)이라는 革命演劇演出目錄이붓텃고 勞動祭날을期하야는 獨逸의勞働者로부터 佛蘭西의農民으로부터서 힘잇는 환영의말이붓헛슴니다。
只今지迷信과 사랑의安息處이엿든 巨大한地主의莊園은勞働人의安息處이요 새로운建設의工場으로化하엿슴니다。
이곳에서새로운階級的世界主義를發見할수가잇슴니다。只今지의文學은莊園文學이요 特殊한莊園主의封建的表現임에不拘하고 새로운農村은 人類生活의世界的集團과 建設로의邁進하는 그것이라볼수잇슴니다。
只今지 地主의莊園이요 封鎖되엿든 農村은 都會와 融和해가는수밧게는업게되엿슴니다。過去의멧멧特殊한農村 田園詩人이그려온바 田園詩敍情詩以外로近代新階級의擡頭는이原始的農村을注視하기始作하고 새로운農村의建設을 노래하고 敍事하는것임니다。
이곳에는只今지吾等이發見할수업섯든새로운人類의進路를발견할수잇고 이새로운建設을背景으로한偉大한人類의自覺을차질수잇슴니다。
다만一個人의所有엿든 封建的農村에는 現代人類의最尖端을象徵하는科學的建設의基礎의確立과 밋集團的人類生活의一側面을只今現露西亞의開放된農村에서發見할수가잇슴니다。
이갓흔集團的建設에선 農村은 새로운時代的템포와共히 그곳에人類에새로운새살림을表象하는 文化를産出할 수가 잇섯든것이고 世界的建設로의一步를發見할수가잇슴니다。
이곳에는宿命論的 生活觀으로부터科學的新社會建設의文化가充滿하고잇슴니다。
이갓흔意味에서 現人類社會의文化는 이農村文化의새로운進出과 밋都會의建設과融和한다는課題가가장 큰問題라고生覺하는同時에한그事實에잇서 그러할것임니다。
이것은 現代社會科程의必然한現象이요 이共通된文化의出現과 文學的表現의位置는 當然히이새로운人類의趨勢를잘象徵하고잇슴니다。
作家「옙흐도키몹흐」는「鍾」이라는小說을通하야 새로운人類의莊園의建設을表示하엿고「쇼로홉흐」는『平和한「돈」地方』을 그리워새로운人類의方向을 明白히 吾等에指示하고잇슴니다。
過去의文學은莊園의文化이엿고 그文學的所産은 地主와 貴族의殘灰이엿슬이나 今日의露西亞의文學은 人類의文學이요人類의새로운生活建設目的이라는點에서 人類生活建設의共通된趨勢와 一尖端的傾向을잘말하고잇슴이아닌가 生覺함니다。
