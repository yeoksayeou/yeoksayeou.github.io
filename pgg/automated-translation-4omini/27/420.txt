Meteorological Lecture: The Cause of the Rainy Season  
Kyungseong Observation Institute, Cho Yeong-geun  

The geography of Korea is elongated from north to south, covering an area of over fourteen thousand three hundred square li. In relation to the vast continental land of China, which holds the first position in the world by area, Korea's climate exhibits peculiar variations characteristic of continental climates. During winter, the significant temperature transitions of three cold snaps and four warm spells, and in summer, the occurrence of drought for several days followed by torrential rain and prolonged rainy periods lead to a generally unpredictable climate. This results in yearly losses due to climatic irregularities affecting agricultural schedules.

Although the area is small, the climatic transitions between the southern and northern regions are significant, with the average annual temperature in the southernmost regions like Gyeongsangnam-do and Jeollanam-do being around twenty degrees Celsius compared to about seven degrees Celsius at the northern end in Hamgyeongbuk-do and Pyeongando; thus, the temperature difference between north and south is around six degrees. Furthermore, places like Pyeongbuk Junggangjin show a four-degree difference, where deep winter temperatures can drop to minus forty-two degrees Celsius, reminiscent of the extreme cold regions in "Sasastir" (사가쓰치). The rainfall from June to September ranges greatly, with the southern area experiencing between eight hundred to nine hundred millimeters, while the northern area sees around four hundred fifty millimeters. Notably, winter rainfall is dominantly taken by the inland areas from Busan, Jeonju, Daegu, and Kyungseong.

The total average annual rainfall in Kyungseong is approximately one thousand two hundred fifty millimeters, with about seventy percent of that occurring during the rainy season, equating to around nine hundred millimeters. During this rainy period, the rainfall often takes the form of intense showers, leading to rapid increases in river levels and significant damage. For instance, on July 26 of the fifteenth year of Taisho, from eight-thirty in the morning to nine-thirty, a heavy downpour in Kyungseong resulted in seventy-three millimeters of rain (equivalent to about one and a quarter geun). As a consequence, the northern area encountered substantial flooding, damaging over a hundred houses, with the Han River banks also affected severely.

From a meteorological perspective, the rainy season typically begins around late May, which is the planting season for farmers. The climate of Korea during this transitional period is particularly unstable, with frequent shifts in temperature leading to alternating sunny and rainy days. Around June 21, as the summer solstice is approached, the day length increases with fourteen hours and forty-five minutes of daylight and nine hours and fifteen minutes of night. The position of the sun is vertical (at a height of ninety degrees) directly overhead, and thus it radiates a significant amount of heat during that roughly fifteen-hour period. The Earth's surface consists of two-thirds water and one-third land, which is a common understanding among people. However, land retains heat quicker than water, both heating and cooling more rapidly due to its properties, which is the major reason affecting the climate of Korea.

Direct influences on Korea's climate arise from the continual pressure of low pressure systems originating from the Yangtze River area in southern China. This low pressure results from intense heat, causing physical convection to occur, leading to decreased pressure in the surrounding air. Moving from Shanghai and the East China Sea towards Kyushu in Japan, it encounters cold currents forming strong high pressure in the straits near the "Okhotsk" Sea causing it eventually to dissipate partway. Due to the continuous movement of this low pressure, Korea’s southernmost region experiences about a month of overcast skies with drizzle, which is termed "梅雨" (meiyu, the rainy season). The unique characteristic of this Meiyu is that with insufficient wind, the rain may persist for an entire day, causing moisture to accumulate on buildings and equipment, leading to spoilage and mildew, hence it’s often called "mildew rain."

Korea is greatly influenced by this Meiyu, which when translated in Japanese is known as "露明" (tsuyuake), refers to the early July period when the low pressure originating from the Yangtze River gradually strengthens, moving northeast and transitioning into dew, passing through northern Shanghai and entering the Yellow Sea, before traversing the strait between Korea and the Japan Sea towards northern Hokkaido. This low pressure system differs from the low pressure during the rainy season as it brings with it strong winds and rain, resulting in severe, torrential rainfalls and the potential for significant damage in the areas it advances towards.

Usually, when a low pressure system traverses Korea, the weather tends to return to a clear, blue sky. However, during the rainy season, weather conditions are contrary; as a low pressure system passes through, the upper air becomes highly disturbed and chaotic, leading to changes in wind patterns at different altitudes. As such, if we observe the irregular movement of the air currents, we may see dark clouds gathering from the south while strange clouds approach from the north, commonly intersecting.

Around July 15, the ocean’s surface fully exhibits its heat retention effect, resulting in the formation of an oceanic low pressure system. The oceanic low pressure system affecting Korea and Japan often develops eastward off Taiwan among the "Philippines" islands or the "Mariana" islands. As these systems intensify, they turn into typhoons, which are massive low pressure systems, with a radius of about one hundred kilometers and a central pressure variance of thirty-five to forty millimeters. The forward momentum of a typhoon can exceed twenty meters per second (with a wind pressure above forty-two katsu), which creates fierce storms at sea. Upon landfall, these systems can topple buildings and trees, causing rivers to overflow and creating a devastating flood environment.

Typhoons typically originate from oceanic contact with high pressures in the area east of Hokkaido during the rainy season, where the strength of these systems moves southward, inevitably weakening. When they reach the Japanese coastline, they typically reduce the intensity of the storm by approximately half. However, there are rare cases where their original strength is maintained throughout their track.

In terms of their movement speed, the quickest can travel around thirty kilometers per hour, while the slower ones might take more than twenty kilometers per day. The time frame for a typhoon moving from near Taiwan to the southern coastline of Japan usually ranges from three to four days, while traveling directly across the Yellow Sea to Manchuria could take anywhere from five days to over ten days. Given the nature of a typhoon and the temperature related to its predicted path, establishing a standard timeframe is challenging, and making predictions can be difficult.

The reference in the calendar to two hundred ten days signals the days that correspond to two hundred ten days post the first day of spring, generally falling around September 22 or 23. During this period, there are warnings to exercise special caution regarding maritime activities due to the likelihood of a typhoon affecting Japan. Korea is not significantly impacted at that time; however, a low pressure system from the Yangtze River or a typhoon from the South Seas affects the atmosphere in Korea, leading to a notably sluggish pressure configuration. Consequently, there can be prolonged periods of overcast weather, as the sun's intense heat may lead to overwhelming discomfort.

In this instance, local phenomena such as secondary low pressures might develop in areas like Hwanghaedo and Wonsan, culminating in thunderstorms and vivid lightning in the Gyeonggi and Chungbuk regions, intermittently accompanied by sudden torrential rain, causing rapid river surges. After around two or three hours, the weather usually clears up, returning to a bright and pleasant day.

Such climatic changes occur most notably at the end of the drought season, where rainfall may momentarily accumulate in large amounts, but this is often a transient occurrence. In cases where the climate fluctuates over several days, it is common for late rains to return, warranting significant attention.

By September 20, Korea transitions to early autumn, characterized by a balance of cold and warmth throughout the day, creating a stabilizing climate that endures amidst the oncoming initial stages of winter in eastern Hokkaido as a new high-pressure system expands back over the Japan Sea, leading to a seasonal shift toward winter conditions.  

**Summary**

The article discusses the meteorological causes of the rainy season in Korea, emphasizing the influence of continental climate and the effects of geography on local weather patterns. It details the phenomena of low-pressure systems originating from China, their movement, and the consequent impact on weather, including the periodic occurrence of typhoons. Of particular interest to historians might be the ways in which the irregularities of the rainy season affected agriculture and daily life during the colonial period, illustrating the broader environmental challenges faced by Koreans under Japanese rule.

						京城測候所 趙永根
朝鮮에地形은南北이長하며그總面積이一萬四千三百餘方里로西便黃海를隔하야世界에서第一位에面積을占한宏大한中國大陸이잇는關係로朝鮮의氣象은大陸性特有한變態的氣象이다。冬期에顯著한三寒四溫의氣溫變遷과夏期에臨하면數朔에亘한旱魃는暴注性降雨卽驟雨性長久한雨期等으로乾坤에順序가一定치못하야年年히不順한氣候로因한損失이年中行事의格으로만타。面積은비록狹小하나氣候의變遷은南部와北部에差異가만하서最南端인慶尙南道全羅南道等의年平均溫度는十四道內外를보히나北端인咸鏡北道平安島는七度內外로南北과比較한溫度의差가六度나되며더욱平北中江鎭가튼곳은四度로深冬의最低溫度가攝氏零下四十二度로降下하야맛치北露極限地帶인「사가쓰치-ㄹ」(Sasastir)地方二月溫度에彷佛하게되며霖雨期인六月로부터九月지의雨量은南端은八百粍內至九百粍요北端은四百五十粍內外나就中 冬量의降雨는釜山地方으로부터全州大邱京城元山의順序로南部內陸地方이第一位를占하게된다。
京城의一年摠平均雨量은千二百五十餘粍中霖雨期間摠平均量이七割로九百粍나되며雨期中降雨의形勢는暴注性驟雨가大部分으로一時에暴量으로河川이急時로增水되여不少한被害를밧게된다。지난大正十五年七月二十六日午前八時三十分부터同九時三十分지滿一時間에京城市中에暴注한雨量은七十三粍(一坪比例一石三斗四升)의大量으로因하야北部一帶는倒潰侵水流失家屋이百餘戶에達하얏스며漢江沿岸도泰甚하얏다。
氣象學으로본霖雨의原因 一般農家의播種期인五月下旬頃부터우리朝鮮의氣候는換節時期의中心이되여溫度에變遷이頗히不順하야서晴雨에天氣가一日中에도時時로相變하야雨天을보게되다가도곳날이개이여好晴을보게되면이어서西편하날로부터黑雲이襲來하야全世界가暗黑하며今方비가올듯하다가도다시晴天을보게되는일이일년中弟一甚한다。大略一朔이지난六月二十一日頃夏至節季를맛게되면晝長夜短으로晝間十四時四十五分夜間이九時十五分間이나되며太陽의位置는우리의頭上(高度九十度)에서直射로上記晝間時間인略十五時間이나射熱作用을함으로地球가밧는熱도라多量일것이다。地球表面은海面이三分之二陸面이三分一이라함은萬人이旣知하는바이나陸地는海水에比하야保溫作用이速하야沸騰하는것도大端르고冷却하는것도最速한것이그의特性인關係가最大原因으로朝鮮에直接影響을주는中國南部內陸에잇는楊子江附近에서連續的으로低氣壓이發生(發生原因은高溫으로因하야物理學的으로對流作用을하면周圍空氣의壓力이稀薄함으로생기는것)하야上海와東海를것처日本九州地方으로向하다가北海道東北便에잇는「오호쓰크」海峽에寒流로생긴優勢한高氣壓이日本中部지擴張한權勢에눌니어中途에서그의자취가사라지게된다。이低氣壓이連續으로往來하는影響에인하야日本東北地方을除한西部로부터朝鮮最南端인慶南一部에지略一個月間은陰雲하며細雨가오락가락하게되니이를梅雨라한다。이梅雨의特有性은바람이그다지불지안흐면至難한비가一日도치지안코옴으로建築物과器具等에水分이附着하야腐敗되여곰팽이(黴)가생긴다하야世稱黴雨라고도한다。朝鮮은梅雨에直接큰영향이업다가所謂日本語로「露明(ツユアケ)」즉七月初旬頃이면楊子江에서생긔는低氣壓이漸漸勢力이强하야지며北東으로進行露를變하야上海北方을經由하야黃海로進出하야서朝鮮中部或은南部와朝鮮海峽을通過하야日本海를것처北海道로逸走하게된다。이低氣壓은上記한바와가티梅雨時期의低氣壓과달라서風雨가甚하야그의進行先露附近地方은風勢가甚하야暴注性驟雨와多量에降雨가잇서時時로不尠한被害를當하게된다。普通時는低氣壓이朝鮮을橫斷하면곳天候는恢復하야碧空의透明한晴天을보는것이常例이나霖雨期中에는그와正反對로低氣壓이通過할수록其後에上層空氣가大端混亂狀態가되어地上五百米突乃至八百米突附近은南風인濕風이불며千米突內外部分은西風其上은東風으로空氣에動流가一定치못하야各空層이相異하게된다。如斯히氣流가不安定할에우리肉眼으로浮雲의動搖를仰觀할지면南空에서北으로黑雲이群集하는同時에北空에서怪雲이襲來하야相交함을明白히알수있다。七月十五日頃에이르면海洋面이完全한保溫作用을하야海上低氣壓이發生할이다。朝鮮과日本을襲擊하는海上低氣壓의發生하는곳은臺灣東方에잇는「필리ᅋᅴᆫ」群島나南東方海上에잇는「마리아나」群島는「마루샐」群島부터勢力이强한颱風(一名大風)이란宏大한低氣壓이생긔니이颱風은半徑이百粁나되며그의深度는中心과周圍의氣壓의差가三十五粍內至四十粍나되고그의進行하는前面은暴風의速度가一秒間에二十米突以上(風壓四十二貫以上)으로海上에서이를맛나게되면暴風으로因한激甚한怒濤와强雨로艦舶이顚覆되여浸沒하게되며上陸하게되면建築物과樹木等이倒潰되며河川이汎濫하야洪水의修羅場으로多大한災殃을惹起하는怪物이다。이颱風이發生할는梅雨期의北海道東方海上에優勢한高氣壓이南便으로多少移動하면서그의勢力이弱하야日本東海岸에根據를置하고그에勢力이日本海를건너朝鮮中部以北으로그의尖端이舌刑으로내밀이여잇스며一便楊子江流域에低氣壓의發生이杜絶하게된다。이優勢한颱風이進行하는方路는一段臺灣附近에오게되면朝鮮은高氣壓의圈內로日氣는晴明하며東風이吹來하고日本은曇天으로亦是東風이强하게불게된다。颱風은臺灣서부터北으로進行하야東海南部로그의宏壯한恣態를移動하다가(이南鮮方面은陰曇한天氣로東風이一變하야北風으로轉換)다시東北便으로進路를遷變하야日本南部나或은日本內陸으로上陸하야만흔被害를惹起하면서日本東海岸는北海道를襲擊하는例가大體만타。卽日本方面으로進路를取할朝鮮은그反面으로旱魃이繼續하야農作物에枯渴이甚하며는飮料水缺乏의人心洶洶의消息이次次만이傳하게된다。즉日本은風水災로苦痛을밧는中이면朝鮮은旱災로因하야各地에서祈雨祭를지낸다하야甘雨喜雨를苦待하게되는것이다。然이나朝鮮도이怪物인颱風의襲擊이往往잇스니乙丑年水難이이를明歷히證明할수잇는事實이다。一段東海로나온颱風이東北便으로進行치안코直線으로黃海를것처滿洲北部로向하게되는일도年年數次이나大槪는黃海近傍에到達하면그의勢力이이半分이나衰退하는것이常例이다。그러나時期에라原勢力대로進行하는例도잇스니이는極히稀有한것으로볼수밧게업다。이제그의進行하는速度를볼지면最速한것은一時間三十粁內外遲鈍한것은一日間에二十粁밧게못되며臺灣附近서부터日本南海를通過하야日本東海岸지要하는時日이速性은三四日遲한것은一週日以上이나되며一直線으로黃海를것처滿洲北部에지達하는時日은速한것은五日內外遲한것은十餘日을要하게된다。颱風의性質과進行先路地의溫度關係로一定한標準時日을確定할수업게되며라判斷함의도至難한것이다。曆面에二百十日이라하는것은立春날부터二百十日에該當하는날로大槪九月二三日頃으로이優勢한颱風이日本近傍을襲來하는例가만흐니出航과海邊의作業에對하야特別注意하라는警告가잇다。朝鮮은大槪此期에颱風이襲來치안는故로別影響이업슬것이다。楊子江附近으로부터오는低氣壓과南洋方面으로오는颱風이업서도朝鮮一帶는氣壓의配置가大端히緩慢하야薄曇한天氣에太陽의高熱인災害가尤甚할이면바람한점업시무르녹은듯한燻氣가全空에充滿하야氣分이鬱々하다, 이黃海道冲과元山冲에局地副低氣壓이突發하면午後부터京畿忠北地方은雷聲電光이激甚하고落雷지招來되며라暴注의驟雨가만하서霎時에河川의增水를보다가略二三時間이經過하면天氣는囘復하야晴天으로안인凉風이불어爽快한氣分을주게하는例도만타。이러한氣候는大槪旱魃終熄期에만하서雨量도一瞬間에多量으로數十粍를보게되나모도가一時的現象에不過하다。如斯히數日間飜覆하게되면及其也에遲離한雨期에들게되는例가常例이니極히注目을要할만한것이다。九月二十日이되면朝鮮은初秋로暑寒이相半하야서一日中에溫度의變化가均等하야一年中에靜肅한氣候가되나北海道東方은初冬을맛게됨으로該方面으로新生高氣壓이다시日本海에擴張하야滯留함으로高西低의氣壓配置로朝鮮一帶는秋期特有한東風이數日繼續하다가冬節로遷한다。
