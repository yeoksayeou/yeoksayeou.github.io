龍岡 民謠, 님노래  
You are going to leave, aren't you?  
Like a dull crow's cry.  
Even if I were to leave, it would be difficult,  
Even if I were to leave, would it be this painful?  

When the thousands of scrolls of poetry are untouched,  
Why is the word "parting" not heeded?  
The word "parting" does not burn,  
Though the word "meeting" might taste sweet.  

2  
What is it about you, dear,  
That keeps me awake before sleep?  
After eating, while resting,  
Every sip of alcohol brings thoughts of you.  
While sleeping, in my dreams,  
Thoughts of you linger.  
In this painful world,  
Let me climb the honey locust tree and look out.  

3  
Through the seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter,  
Only thoughts of you dwell in my mind.  
I bring sweet water from the river,  
And place it at your feet.  
And as I sigh, the flowers bloom.  

4  
Oh, are you in the arms of someone else?  
Or are you lost to me?  
In the sound of the crickets in the behind,  
All of man's heart melts away.  

5  
The bellbird rising in the bright day under the blue sky,  
Is bright in this house as well.  
By the yard stands the black Ginkgo tree,  
This house seems to only know bitterness.  

**Summary**  

This article features a collection of folk songs expressing deep emotions related to love and parting, highlighting the sentiments of longing and nostalgia prevalent during the era. The poems illustrate a sense of melancholy as the speaker grapples with the feelings of separation and the beauty of memories associated with a loved one.

龍岡 民謠, 님노래
						洪鍾仁
너를두고 가긴가나
알둔새의 넉시로다
간다한들 아조가며
아조간들 이즐소냐

萬卷詩書 불노을때
離別離字 왜두엇노
離別離字 불을놋코
맛날逢字 쓰렴으나

2
님이란건 왜이런건지
잠들기전에 못잇겟네
밥을먹고 잇잣더니
술끗마다 님의생각
잠을자고 잇잣더니
꿈결에도 님의생각
재미업는 세상사리
박넝쿨이나 올녀보세

3
춘하추동 사시절에
님의생각 뿐이로다
단물을 기러다가
독전에 갓다놋코
싹돌라스며 한숨진다

4
안젓스니 님이오나
누엇스니 님이오나
뒷ㅅ담속에 蟋蟀聲에
사람의간장 다녹인다

5
白日靑天에 뜬종달이
요내속가티도 달떳서라
마당전에 북덕불은
요내속가티 속만탄다
＜2-3＞
