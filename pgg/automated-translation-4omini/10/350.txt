기사형태	논설 (Essay)  

This year is unfortunate. As the year ends, I find myself reflecting on the events that transpired and the mirror that was held to my conscience reveals a mixed bag of sentiments. 

When I consider the misfortunes that struck the nation, particularly the unrelenting strife and sorrow born from our external circumstances, it becomes painfully clear that we have not been blessed with fortuitous tidings. The simmering tension among neighboring nations, the indifferent gaze of the world upon our struggles, and the incessant questions of our identity continue to haunt us. 

In these times of despair, what solace can we offer ourselves as we stand at the threshold of a new year? The sands of time trickle down, and yet our predicaments linger like shadows. The deep yearning for development, peace, and unity remains unfulfilled, and uncertainty plagues our minds. 

As we gaze into the future with cautious hearts, the burden of our present afflictions weighs heavily upon our souls. The warmth of hope flickers dimly, and each person must search for strength in their own way. 

Ultimately, as the sun rises on the dawn of a new year, the question remains: will we emerge from the clutches of misfortune, or will the cycle of anguish perpetuate? The clarity we seek is yet to materialize, but we must persist. 

 

**Summary**  

In this essay, the author reflects on the misfortunes experienced throughout the year, emphasizing the ongoing struggles faced by the nation amid external pressures and a lack of fortune. The piece captures the essence of despondency and a hesitant yearning for improvement as the new year approaches. Historians may find value in this text as it encapsulates the sentiments prevalent during a time of colonial oppression, highlighting the collective anxiety and hope for a better future amidst the challenges faced by Korea under Japanese rule.
