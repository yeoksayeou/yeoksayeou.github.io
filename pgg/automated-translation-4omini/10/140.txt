**Summary**  

This article examines the changes in employment and the general living conditions of Koreans over the year, providing statistical data on job seekers and those employed in various sectors. It highlights a slight increase in employment numbers, though the overall situation remains precarious, indicating ongoing socioeconomic challenges during the colonial period. Historians may find the detailed statistics revealing of the transitional labor market dynamics and the social stratification that existed, particularly the variance between male and female employment opportunities.
