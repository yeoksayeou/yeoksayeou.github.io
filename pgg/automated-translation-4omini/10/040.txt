To the friends living in the city of Seoul!

How do you hear the ringing sound of the noon bell that resonates like a bell awakened in the Cheondong Church at noon? Since the daily noon cannon shot has not been heard from Namsan Chamdo, the combined sounds of factory whistles hitting the air after it strike, seems like a demonstration of their vitality. But the sound following the ringing of that bell from Bukchon, resembles the sound of life in Bukchon disappearing, and it only adds to discomfort. 

This stirring sound would awaken even the sleeping children, it seems that they wouldn't feel even a slight regret if their noon was not announced by such an alarming sound...<155>  

**Summary**  

This article discusses the daily experience of the noon bell ringing in Seoul, specifically referring to its resonance from Cheondong Church and its connection to the sounds of industry. The author expresses a sense of discomfort and nostalgia, implying that the rhythm of life in Bukchon is diminishing as it is overshadowed by industrialization. This reflects the broader themes of disruption and loss during the colonial period in Korea, highlighting how modernization was often experienced as a lament for traditional ways of life. Historians might find the juxtaposition of urban industrial sounds with the remnants of quieter, community-centered traditions particularly revealing of the societal changes during this era.
