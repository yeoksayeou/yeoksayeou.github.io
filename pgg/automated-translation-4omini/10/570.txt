In the current era, many young men and women of ambition are leaving Korea to study abroad, driven by the desire for knowledge and to contribute to society. These students, often influenced by the traditions of their esteemed families, face numerous challenges in foreign lands. It is important for them to cherish their roots while embracing new cultures and ideas.

Upon returning home, these individuals showcase their gains in knowledge and experience, and they are expected to play a vital role in their communities. The character of the new gentlemen and ladies is shaped by their exposure to different societal norms and educational systems, leading to a rich amalgamation of Eastern and Western perspectives.

Ultimately, the responsibility falls on them to help uplift their homeland and its people, promoting progress while preserving essential cultural values. Their contributions are seen not just as personal achievements, but as important steps in the longer journey towards national advancement.
