Independence Gate and Prison  

This piece reflects on the symbolic significance of the Independence Gate (獨立門) and its relationship to the concept of imprisonment, both literal and metaphorical. The author explores the idea of freedom in the context of colonial rule, suggesting that the presence of such symbols in a restricted society raises profound questions about the true nature of independence. The author notes that while the gate stands for liberation, the reality of colonial torment makes one ponder the paradox of being physically free yet institutionally imprisoned.

Through personal reflections and broader societal observations, the author examines the current state of Korea, emphasizing the struggles of its people under foreign domination. He articulates a sense of longing for genuine liberty as the symbol of prison invades the collective consciousness of the populace, illustrating the deep emotional resonance these structures hold.

In this analysis, the author also addresses various sociopolitical issues faced by Korea, reflecting a critical perspective on the impact of colonialism on the national psyche. The sentiments expressed throughout his writing resonate with the experience of many Koreans who lived under the oppressive conditions of the 1920s, shedding light on the complexities of their aspirations for autonomy.
