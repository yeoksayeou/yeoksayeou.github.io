The article presents a critical reflection on the issues surrounding the concept of the "Separate Universe" (別乾坤) within contemporary society. It explores the implications of prioritizing certain values and experiences over others, framing the discussion within a broader socio-cultural context. The author, Li Kwan-yong, emphasizes the need for a deeper understanding and acknowledgement of the diverse perspectives that exist in society. The survey format allows for a collection of varied opinions that illuminate both the challenges and aspirations of individuals living in this disguised 'Separate Universe.'

This discourse appears particularly revealing in light of Korean colonial history, as it reflects the tensions within the colonial society where diverse voices often struggle to be heard. Historians may find the article's exploration of societal values and the criticisms of contemporary norms significant, pointing to the undercurrents of colonial oppression and the quest for identity during a tumultuous period in Korea.
