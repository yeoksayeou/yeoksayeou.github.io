歲末苦痛 두 가지  
						安碩柱  

At the end of the year, people often reflect on their hardships and troubles. They navigate through two significant types of pain that arise during this time. The first pain pertains to financial strains, where individuals are faced with the burden of debts accumulating throughout the year, impairing their ability to celebrate the New Year joyfully. Many families experience stress over how to make ends meet, further exacerbating feelings of anxiety as they try to provide for their children.

The second pain relates to the emotional burdens that follow the conclusion of another year. Individuals assess their personal achievements and failures, leading to feelings of regret or dissatisfaction. The desires for a better future clash with the grim realities of the present circumstances, creating a psychological toll that weighs heavily on their spirits.

These two pains highlight a profound struggle faced by many during the year-end season, where both financial and emotional challenges converge, making it a time of reflection and often sorrow.

  

**Summary**

The article discusses two prevalent forms of pain experienced by people during the year-end period: financial difficulties and emotional distress related to self-reflection on the year. The commentary illustrates the social pressures faced especially by families struggling to secure a happy New Year under financial distress, and the emotional toll of unfulfilled aspirations. Historians may find it interesting as it reveals insights into the socioeconomic conditions of Koreans during the colonial period, reflecting broader societal challenges.
