**Summary**  

This article outlines a voting form that can be filled out in local barbershops, an interesting method of engaging community participation in the voting process during this era of Japanese colonial rule in Korea. Such practices reflect the cultural exchanges and adaptations that emerged under colonial governance, where traditional settings like barbershops became informal venues for civic activities, revealing both the colonial state's attempts to structure civic participation and the responses of Korean society to those structures.
