It is noted that for the payment of magazine fees or other remittances to our office, sending postage stamps is, for convenience, subject to a small surcharge, and often, there are individuals who send us postal stamps, causing difficulties in handling. Therefore, from now on, please refrain from sending postage stamp payments. ＜141＞
