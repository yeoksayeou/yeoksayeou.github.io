각 도시 탐사에 환영합니다.  

A wind of civilization is increasingly blowing into the so-called metropolitan areas, but there is a malicious wind stirring, and it has become serious as many individuals hide behind masks and are actively engaging in obscure activities. We have diligently explored such dens of vice in the direction of Gyeongseong, and now we aim to exert our utmost efforts to also explore the provincial cities. Therefore, those who have a spirit of altruism are requested to generously supply us with responsible materials. <72>

  
**Summary**  

This article expresses concerns regarding the moral degradation in urban environments during the late 1920s, reflecting a broader anxiety about urbanization and its impact on society. The author calls for collaboration from the public in gathering information about vice in provincial cities, highlighting the increasing complexity of urban life in Korea under colonial rule. Historians may find it interesting as it showcases the social tensions and the response of intellectuals to urban issues during the Japanese colonial period.
