關東民謠  

1. 원주 아리랑  
Gently, with the eastern wind brushing past,  
The flag of Honggapsa temple waves vibrantly.  

When will I ever meet you again?  
I was blocked on my path and couldn't hurry.  

At the back gate, the camellias are blooming,  
Even in Sogudong, I only watch for you.  

When my eyes are closed, it is said that I will fly,  
And when they are open, it is said that I am playing.  

My eyelashes are heavy, as if they cannot lift,  
Spinning round while holding onto the water jug. <2>  

2. 선선 구 아리랑  
Camellia fruit, please open the lid of the shared basket,  
I will go to pick the fruit with the maiden from next door.  

While diligently working on the fields,  
About ten mouths are starving for their evening meal.  

The liquor goes down easily,  
But the rice is stuck in my throat, unable to swallow.  

Looking at the shadow of the water god,  
Is it not frustrating to play the role of village beauty?  

Waiting at the fence for you to show up,  
The pumpkin leaves flutter, making it impossible to see you.  

When the pumpkin leaves flutter, I cannot see you,  
So I will ask the woodcutters in the cave to give me a pumpkin vine. <3>  

**Summary**

It offers a glimpse into the customs and emotional landscape of the time, with references to traditional motifs such as the camellia and the water god.

關東民謠
						車相瓚
1. 原州아리랑
슬슬東風 재넘엣 바람에
홍갑사 당긔가 팔팔난다

내가 나 언제 널 오랫더냐
내길이 밧버서 활깻지햇지

뒤문 밧게 함박꼿송이
소구동하고도 님만 살핀다

떳다 감은 눈치는 날가라는 말이요
감엇다 뜨는 눈치는 놀다가란 말일세

눈섭이 만은 제가 질줌 몰나서
물독을 안고서 팽팽돈다.＜2＞

2. 旋善 舊아리랑
동백나무 열매야 다담북 열어라
이웃집 處女 다리고 열매 따러 갈께

아주가리 농사를 힘쓰고 보니
십여 명 食口가 저녁을 굼네.

술은 술술 잘 넘어가고
밥은 중지가 맥혀서 못먹겟네.

물등우(水翁) 여다노코 물그림자 보니
村색시 노릇하기 제안이 원통한가.

울타리 밋헤다 님세워노코
호박입이 넘줌넌줌 하야 님못뵈네.

호박입이 넌줄넌즘 님 못보거던
洞內樵軍더러다 호박줄것게.＜3＞
＜2-3＞
