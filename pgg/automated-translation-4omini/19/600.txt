기사형태	논설 (Editorial)  

What is the sixth sense? Is there a clear definition of it? It seems there is none. As for the order in which the first through fifth senses may be arranged, it is commonly accepted that there are five senses: sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch, and they facilitate various aspects of human life, which is something even elementary school textbooks outline. However, while it mentions the five senses, it is not stated that there is a sixth sense, leading to confusion when someone claims, “I possess the sixth sense.”

What is this sixth sense?

In response to such questions, how would one reply? 

Person A says, "The sixth sense is a type of perception that transcends the five senses, encompassing intuition, instinct, and clairvoyance, all blending into one." 

Person B adds, "It’s hard to elaborate on this, but perhaps it’s related to carnal sensations! Because scholars of old were sometimes false altruists, declaring that all these sensations combine to make the sixth sense. When students in girls' schools ask during lectures, ‘What is the sixth sense?’ it's quite challenging to explain. It’s as though one ignores one sense and picks the others!” 

Person C comments, "The sixth sense is much like the film news from the Tokyo Asahi Newspaper." 

If this were to be rated as an academic examination, it’s uncertain in what order A, B, and C would rank, but it is indeed certain that there are many contenders for the sixth sense. 

Further proving this is the fact that the Western notion of the sixth sense is entirely different from what we speak of as the sixth sense. 

Western Sixth Sense  

A recent book titled "The Sixth Sense" by Dr. Harris has been published in England. 

According to this book, the term "sixth sense" in the West is vague and has various contenders. 

Person A states, "The sixth sense refers to a woman’s intuition." 

Person B contradicts, stating, "No, that's not it. I essentially perceive dangers. I feel harm when there is none!" 

Person C states, "There are individuals who can sense electricity or other energies. That’s the sixth sense." 

However, Dr. Harris rejects these ABC claims and argues that the real sixth sense dates back about a century to the Scottish Charles Bell, who proposed "muscle sense," which is the same as "muscle perception." 

The five senses operate from the outside world to the internal mind. When one observes a bright light, it enters through the eyes and is perceived through the optic nerve by the brain. 

The historical figure Charles Bell proposed about a century ago that muscle sense, also known as muscle perception, is an experience separate from the five senses. It is a type of perception derived from the state of muscular activity, which one senses based on the degree of tension and relaxation in muscle groups. Bell's research regarding the muscles and nerves recognized two types of nerves, where most transmit signals from the brain to the muscles, but there are also those that carry signals from the muscles back to the brain. The latter is known as muscular perception, and there are no senses correlated with it. This occurs when muscles contract and are sensed, and thus, Harris referred to it as the sixth sense. 

To provide an example, if you want to determine the weight of an object, aside from weighing it, when you pick it up, you can usually estimate the weight based on the tension you feel in your hands. Some may call that pressure, but pressure can be understood without feeling the musculoskeletal system's response to an object’s weight. Therefore, this sixth sense, or muscle sense, allows for more precise perception. 

If we attempt to lift a certain object based solely on the sixth sense, we can estimate how much force we need to exert. Thus, even before touching the object, the muscles prepare for the undertaking. If the object in question is a prop stone used in a theatrical play, which is made of wood coated with paint to resemble real stone, an individual might lift it with excessive force, thinking it is a real stone, resulting in unintended consequences such as losing balance. 

In sports, this sixth sense plays an essential role, whether in tennis, baseball, or football, as it informs the muscles about how much speed and power are necessary, as well as the direction in which to hit the ball. This applies to various sports, but particularly billiards requires exceptional development of the sixth sense. 

When food enters the mouth, the chewing force is delicately adjusted according to its size and texture, which also indicates the presence of the sixth sense. 

From this, we can see that the understanding of the sixth sense we articulate is markedly different from what the West refers to as the sixth sense. (End)

**Summary**

This article seeks to explore the concept of the sixth sense, contrasting various interpretations of the term in both Western and Korean contexts. It discusses how, while five senses are universally acknowledged, the concept of the sixth sense remains ambiguous, with different cultural backgrounds offering unique perspectives. The inclusion of Western scientists like Dr. Harris and Charles Bell illustrates a transnational discussion on perception, which reflects the interplay of cultural ideas and scientific inquiry during Korea's colonial period. Historians may find the article noteworthy as it showcases early attempts at integrating Western concepts into Korean thought while grappling with the language and cultural implications.

常識講座 第六感은 어더한感覺?
第六感이라는것은 어더한感覺이냐?
이것에 對한확실한 定議는 업는것갓다 第一感으로부터 第五感지가 어더한 順序로로되여잇는지는모르나 視覺 聽覺 臭聽 味覺 觸覺 이라하야서 이五感이 人間生活의 萬事를 便利케해주는것은 小學校讀本에도 活字로나오는이만큼 確實하고 普通的이다. 그러나 五感은잇스나 六感이잇다고는 쓰여잇지안이하엿스니만치 여러 가지感覺이『내가그六感이로라』하고나서는것가태서 大端히 混亂하다.
第六感이라니 어더한感이냐?
리러한 質問에무엇이라고 對答을해?
甲曰『第六感이라는것은 五感을 超越한 感覺으로 靈感과 直感과 千里眼과 이모든것을合해가지고 다시 그數대로개인것인다 乙曰『第六感이라는것은 히히 크게는못하겟스나 히히 저 性感이라나! 녯날 學者들이란 모도 僞善者인닭에 性感을 合해서 全部가 六感이라고 公表를하면 女學校에서 講義를 하는中 先生님 六感이라는것은 무엇입닛가하면 알어듯도록 說明을하기가 어려우닛가 나머지 一感은 모른체하고 띄여먹은게지 무얼!』丙曰『第六感이라는것은 東京朝日新聞의키네마뉴―스와갓다』이것을 八學試驗이라고보고 採點을한다면 甲乙丙의 順序로될는지는모르나 如何間 第六感에 對한 候補者가 만흔것은 確實하다.
다시 이것을 證明하기에자미잇는것은 西洋의 六感과우리가말하는 六感과는 全然틀닌다는것이다 이양이거리나하나 늘니가하니다음것을닑어주기바란다
西洋의 第六感
푸레―서―하리스博士의 近著『第六感』(The Six Sense.) 이라는것이 英國에서 出版이되엿다.
이冊에 依해서보면 西洋에서도「第六感」이란  大端히 曖昧하여서 여러 가지가 候補者가잇다 A曰「第六感은 女性이가지고잇는 直覺을말함이다」B曰「안이다 그러치안타 나는 本來고양이를 실력한다내게 害를끼치지안컨만 엇전지실히하는 그 感覺이다」C曰「電氣나 礎器를 感할수잇는 能力을가진사람이잇다 그것이 第六感이다」
그러나 하리스博士는 이ABC어느것이고 否認하고 眞正의 第六感이라는것은 至今으로부터 約百年前에 스곳트란드의촤―르스 베일傾이 主唱한「筋力感」는「筋感」이라는 感覺이 그것이라고한다.
五感이라는것은 外界에서 內部로 作用한다 밝안불을본다 밝안불이 眼孔으로 綗膜에빗친다 綗膜에서 腦髓아지 神經이란놈이 빼더밋서서 밝앗타고 感한다.
여기에 촤―르스 베일傾이 百年前에「筋力感」는筋感이라고한것은 五感以外의것으로 筋力의 活動狀態에 依하야 知得하는＜154＞一種의 感覺이며 筋肉는 筋肉群에밧는 張力과 弛■과 抵抗의 程度에따라서 感知하는것이다 베일傾이 筋力과 神經과의 對하야 硏究한 것으로 二種의 神經이잇는것을알게되엿다 神經의 大部分은 腦髓에서 筋肉으로가는것이지만 이것과는 반대로 筋肉에서부터 腦髓로가는 神經이잇는것을 發見한것이다 이 後者가 즉筋肉의 知覺이라고하는것이며 感覺에틀님이업다 이것은 筋肉이 收縮할에 感하는것이며 그럼으로 筋力感이니 筋感이니하는 일흠이생기고 하리스博士가 이것을 第六感이라고부르게되엿다.
잠간 例을드러보면 무슨물건이고 그무게를알냐면 저울에다러서 무게를아는以外에 그물건을쓴우에울녀 놋코들어보면 대개얼마가령의무게가되는것을집작할수가잇다 或그것은 壓力이나니냐고말하는사람이잇슬는지모르나 壓力은 筋感을움지기지안코물건을손우에 올녀노앗슬의 感하는힘이고 이것은 第六感筋力感보다 正確한 知覺을할수업는것이다.
우리가 만약에방치를하나를들녀면 第六感에 依하야그돌을들기에는 얼마나한힘을내여야할것을알수가잇다 그럼으로방치돌에 손을대이기前에 벌서 筋力은힘을 準備를하잇다 그럼으로 이방치돌 演劇에서쓰는 擬石으로 나무에조회를바르고 彩色을칠한것이라고하면 그것을실제의돌인줄알고 번쩍드는사람은 별안간에 힘이남어서 돌은손에서 空中으로올나갈것이고 그사람은뒤로벌넝넘어질것이다 스포―쓰에는이 第六感이더듸든지 重大한 役割을가지고잇다 테니스배―스뽈 풋뽈 어느것이고그럿다 뽈을 라켓트로치는데서 筋肉에 感知된 第六感은얼마나한速力으로 얼마나한힘으로 어느 方向을 向하야따려야한다는것을아르켜준다 다른스포―쓰에도 그러하다 特히 撞球選手는더구나이第六感이 發達된사람이라야한다.
한 食物을입에물엇슬에 그 食物의 大小와 軟硬에따라서 咀嚼하는힘이 微妙하게 調節되는것도 이第六感이잇는닭이다.
이것을보면 우리가말끗마다 第六感第六感하고드는것과 西洋에서 말하는 그것과는 大端히달은것을알수가잇다. (終)＜155＞
