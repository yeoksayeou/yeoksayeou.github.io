紛 has been present since before the Common Era in both Eastern and Western cultures. In the East, it was developed by China as early as the time of King Zhou Wen. Later, around 350 years before the Common Era, Qin Shihuang ordered one of the beauty attendants from the 3000 beauties of the Afang Palace to apply it correctly, along with applying rouge and dye (for eyebrows), and he was captivated by their beauty while observing them. <125>
