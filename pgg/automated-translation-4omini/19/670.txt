A piece of farmland  
A man farmer  
Near the house, every rice paddy  
A woman farmer  

When the young saplings are firmly planted  
As the water comes running, the swallows  
Start to chase the water away  

With a joyful hat on my head  
In the muddy paddy,  
As the night rain falls  

In the silver and golden threads,  
So beautiful are the countless  
Various songs, drifting down. <161>  

**Summary**

The poem "모중" (Transplanting) captures the serene and harmonious life of farmers during the rice planting season. It evokes the image of both men and women engaged in the agricultural practice of transplanting rice seedlings, highlighting the natural beauty and vibrant sounds of rural life. The work reflects a strong connection to the agrarian lifestyle, which may resonate with the experiences of Korean farmers during the colonial period. Historians would find it particularly interesting as it encapsulates the daily lives and cultural practices of Koreans at a time when their agrarian identity was under pressure from colonial rule.
