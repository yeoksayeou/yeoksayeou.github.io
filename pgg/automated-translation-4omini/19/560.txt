Early Summer Great Cleanliness  

◇Tower Cave Park  

As a Cleaner, my responsibility is to assess what’s fallen into disarray. Why is this park so dirty? If it's just a place for amusement, I would invest a hundred won to engage in some exercise myself. The filth in this restroom is appalling; it’s so disgraceful that I can hardly describe it! In a hurry, if one needs to use it, they may just manage to do so!  

This stench is enough to finally, fittingly describe them! Are these even the usual patrons of this park in the center of Seoul?  

Even if they don’t know better, here come those selling ice cream! Only those limited friends who are stuck doing nothing and those in search of fortune-telling! A frustrated friend clinging to The Romance of the Three Kingdoms in the shade of a tree! They're a satirical mix of lazy people, dragging along leftovers from the old days! These are the masters of Tower Cave Park located in the heart of the capital! They are the guests! When foreign tourists arrive, attendees from elsewhere are often astounded when they visit this central public park.  

One can learn a lot about these foreigners’ lifestyles and temperaments just by observing them in the park.  

While the land of Joseon has its offerings of sights to see, to send these filthy people as a representation of Joseon is an insult to our city and to the worth of this nation! 

Is it legitimate commerce to showcase this parade of drunks and to let them run about in broad daylight? Isn’t it high time we took on a more fitting look for a public park! If all these people keep showing up, how can the park ever be regarded commendably! If I don’t receive a billyto conduct myself effectively, the park or the surrounding grounds will always remain in ruin! <150>  

◇Half-Western Manufactured Monsters  

Regardless of whether they are handsome or ugly, you can usually find sights that are far worse than what is commonly seen in Seoul. In the midst of all this, one sees people declaring, “I just returned from the United States!” or “I just came back from somewhere!” Having spent lavishly, they return just to boast, puffing their chests and acting aloof among those without money! It’s like someone overflowing with insincerity! What kind of person is one when, after visiting America, they can’t even tell if they’re a gentleman or a rogue? People come back from the U.S. claiming they are Americans or from Russia proclaiming they are Russian. The reality is they are merely pretending, showing off foreign phrases whose meanings they likely don’t understand! Why didn’t they ever reach out to seek help beforehand? Pretending to enjoy Western things, they end up as mere half-Western imposters!  

As a result, they scramble to experience Western cuisine, putting together money they can scarcely afford, just to have a meal at a half-Western establishment called The Lily Garden. They behave as if they have rights to grants of privilege! To enjoy Western dishes, cannot even talk like a Western person? Certainly if money is used to gain wealth, it would have to be utilized! Yet who among our general populace seeks out these kinds of characters in those who come and go like this?   

Oh, Sanitation Chief! What should we do? Throw them away!  

◇Is it an arch or a sneeze?  

If it’s a trend, just raise your nose in the air! These days, do you see how common these incomplete gates are? What on earth are these gates called? An arch? Oh no—it should be a half-circle to qualify as an arch, right?  

In that I would question whether there is anything well done in the realm of trends in Southern Joseon, to be frank! How is it that these temporary gate stenches arise everywhere these days, oh how repugnant! If they are taken away, just as Seoul becomes slower, these will somehow transform into strong fences!  

Even in the Eight-Day Festival there were arches! During the sports meeting too, arches were present! Now here, arches have become so common! It seems there were once banners announcing everything at bookstores; now, it’s like gates filled with tremendously pleasing movements! It is disgraceful to pass through the gate into the soup restaurant in Jongno 4th Street where one is greeted by all those arches!  

Among all, the scholarly establishment is quite entertaining—how many full creases are they laying up there all crammed within a hole, just to expose some music to it all like frogs? That seems impractical! If there were any phrases properly written, would that not delight our eyes? As it stands, surely, this can’t settle with anything else than a beating! <151>  

◇The Foreign Song and Dance of Gisaeng  

Is it not fitting for Gisaeng (妓生) to also align with modernity? Gisaeng today seem to want to be contemporary or else! The women of Joseon have to be Gisaeng, no matter what! Being modern, what does it entail indeed?  

The Gisaeng, emphasizing modernity, have this view that they can grasp only Western elements—yet there are new trends to embark on which don’t exist in other countries! In foreign lands, those arriving there will explore new fads led by actors but can a Gisaeng fulfill that role? They do not have the choice to become Gisaeng!  

Even when adorned in high skirts while singing imported tunes, or giving away the dance designed with excessive lengths, they unceremoniously strike the ground with their legs, looking completely lost—they remind one of last year's pieces of splendid burnished rice cake pieces!  

They dance according to pleasantries or have arrangements made without any thought—what is the use of requesting these sentiments? Isn’t their complacency on a distancing margin? How would we feel if our prestigious songs and dance were cultivated by the likes of them? It would be so refreshing! Are Gisaeng unaware of how to please? Isn’t it banality that leads them to the forefront: those ignorant Gisaengs would end up being tossed into the refuse bin all at once!  

◇Is it a monastery or a den of vice?  

"Is the world in disarray!" This is for sure the lamentation of stubborn fathers. As Shakyamuni, the Great Venerable, gazes down at this so-called pure realm of a temple, how can he not weep in pain at how, nowadays, temples are mere pots for sale?  

Now they profit from liquor, collect housing rents, or lease chambers hidden away! It has become standard to drink and eat meat while managing extended families with income from Buddhist texts or improper living—what an absurd situation! In what kind of world could the legacy of the Buddha have come to such a phase?  

Even among the temples around the outskirts of the capital, a temple is not one anymore! It’s become a place where the need for cleanliness to be finding wretched women pulling men in stripping away their dignity. If you run short of space, you can even rent a seat in the philosophy hall or the main Buddha’s pedestal, as long as you pay! When lewd acts are performed there, how does this resonate in the mind of the Buddha?  

Bodhisattva! I understand, though I am a worldly man, I implore to live cleanly so that I might help those daughters losing their future in wretched situations nearby.  

I shall clean the temples of the well-off in the capital and around it of wretched women so plea completed.  

Namu Amita Bul. <152>  

**Summary**  

This article from "Byeolgeongon" presents the author's humorous and critical reflections on the state of cleanliness in Tower Cave Park, while contrasting the lives of ordinary Koreans with those they perceive as foreign and modern. The author sarcastically comments on the cleanliness issues, the superficial attempts to embrace Western culture by some people, and the degradation of Gisaeng and temples. Historians would find it noteworthy as it reflects the clash between traditional Korean values and the Western influence during the colonial period, illustrating socio-cultural tensions at the time.
