A Ballad from the West: One Piece of Loyal Heart  
―The Cold Food Woman said―  

By the riverbank,  
The mother wants to gather the water.  
Today, all day long,  
She only fetches water.  
Oh my, oh my,  
It's so exhausting.  

While crossing the water path,  
The bucket is heavy.  
Even if I pretend not to see,  
It would be nice if I helped.  
Oh my, oh my,  
It's so exhausting.  

The bond given to me,  
I swallowed in my heart.  
I swallowed in my heart,  
But cannot speak.  
I've committed a transgression.  
Oh my, oh my,  
It's so exhausting.  

Whether this is good or not,  
It is what I have seen.  
Whether this is good or not,  
My heart knows well.  
Oh my, oh my,  
It's so exhausting.  

**Summary**

This poem reflects the relentless labor of a woman, symbolizing the burdens borne by individuals in a colonial context. It evokes the imagery of daily hardship through the lens of fetching water, conveying deeper themes of loyalty and unspoken transgressions within the societal norm. Historians may find the representation of gender roles and the nuances of emotional labor within the colonial framework particularly interesting, as it opens avenues for exploring the intersection of personal struggle and broader cultural experiences during that era.
