**Summary**  

The article announces the out-of-stock status of several previous issues of the magazine and invites readers to send in those issues in exchange for current or upcoming editions. This practice reflects the challenges faced under colonial conditions, as magazines often faced difficulties in circulation and availability. Historians may find interest in the communal efforts to maintain publications in a colonial context, highlighting resource limitations and consumer engagement in the 1930s Korean society.
