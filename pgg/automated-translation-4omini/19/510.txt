別의別乾坤  

◇Worms of South America  
The worms found in our country are about five inches long, but in South America, there are large worms known as "crocodiles" that measure three to five feet or more.  

◇London's Smoke  
London is not only the largest city in the world but also has the world's largest smoke pollution. In winter, the amount of smoke that people breathe in reaches approximately five hundred trillion particles.  

◇World's Most Expensive Postage Stamp  
Old postage stamps are treasured in countries around the world, but among them, a one-cent (three cents) postage stamp issued about seventy years ago in British Guiana has a current value of sixty-five thousand yen. There may not be an older postage stamp more expensive than this in the world.  

◇World's Largest Park  
The largest park in the world is Yellowstone National Park in the United States, which anyone would know. It spans three hundred twenty miles east to west and two hundred ninety miles north to south, with mountains that reach ten thousand feet and over three thousand six hundred hot springs with geysers. It also has lakes that stretch for over a hundred miles.  

◇Permanent Wave  
In a barbershop in Dublín, Ireland, the price list states:  
For a gentleman's high-quality hair wave, it costs two gold dollars and fifty cents.  
For a permanent hair wave, it costs ten cents.  
One must have the courage to endure a long time and disregard others' criticism.  

◇Underground City  
In Romania, there is an underground city, which originally developed as a place to extract salt from the mines, but now it has become a vast metropolis. It currently has hotels, streetcars, churches, sports fields, lakes, and lotus ponds, making it a significant cultural city.  

◇The Emergence of Munitions  
In this age of mechanical civilization, the American army has completed a humanoid capable of measuring the altitude of invading aircraft with a measuring device and firing at them, achieving successful test results.  

◇The Battle with Cockroaches  
Recently, a large army of cockroaches appeared near a station along the Japan Central Line, blocking the progress of trains and resulting in a significant battle between workers and the cockroaches.  

◇Animals' Fasting Duration  
Animals always need to eat to survive, but some can live for a long time without food. Let's look at how long animals can survive without eating: a dung beetle for three hundred sixty days, a dog for thirty days, a human for twelve days, a small bird for nine days, a bedbug for one thousand two hundred days, a fish for one thousand days, a snake for eight hundred days, and a turtle for five hundred days.  

◇Acute Sense of Smell  
The primitive people of Africa have an extraordinary sense of smell, capable of detecting scents from about a mile away.  

◇Strange Greetings  
There are various ways to greet people, such as in Mongolia, where one sticks out his tongue, and in France, where one rubs noses! This is already well-known! However, on the island of Andagon, blowing into another person's face is considered a greeting, while a powerful bow is regarded as the utmost respect—it truly is another dimension! <133>  

**Summary**  

This article presents intriguing phenomena from various regions, including South American worms, London's heavy pollution, and unique cultural practices across the globe. Most notably, the mention of Romania's underground city reflects the contrasting realities of urban development during the colonial era, showcasing how infrastructure and the environment were shaping human experiences in different parts of the world. Historians might find the references to environmental impacts and cultural exchanges particularly revealing within the context of colonial history in Korea.
