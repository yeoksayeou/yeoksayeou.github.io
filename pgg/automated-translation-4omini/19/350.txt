48 years old  

Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, Candidate Executive Committee Member  
Wang Zhenting (Ru Tang)

For example, it may be a little overwhelming, but this suffices to understand the complexion of the Youth Government. Among those mentioned above, except for Ye Yanqi who is over 50, only Wu Zhi*(65) Lin Jin (67) Cai Yuanpei (60) Zhao Zaiwen (62) are over 60; Zhang Jingjiang is 56. The rest, being in their 30s or 40s, most clearly represent the image of youthful China. As a further examination, since no party member statistics have been announced yet, if we randomly note a few counties from those published:

Bao Mountain County in Jiangxi Province (Party members 354)  
Age         Count       %  
15-19       34          9.01  
20-24       75          19.88  
25-29       93          24.65  
30-34       90          23.85  
35-39       32          8.48  
40-44       24          6.36  
45-          6           1.59  

Thus even when combining those over 30, they still do not constitute one-fifth of the total. 

Haimen County in Jiangsu Province (Party members 493)  
Age         Count       %  
15-19       86          17.44  
20-24       139         28.22  
25-29       126         26.58  
30-34       71          14.41  
35-39       30          6.09  
40-44       41          8.32  
45-          0           0.00  

There are no individuals over 40, and those above 35 are about one-fifth—similar to before.  

Nanjing Special City Party Department (Party members 2727)  
Age             Count  
15-20          765  
21-25          980  
26-30          811  
31-35          346  
36-40          275  
41-45         92  
45-50         56  
51-55         14  
56-          6  

The percentages of this data are left to the readers' arithmetic. Only 40 years and older accounted for a minority at the central government seat, yet even then they only make up about one-seventh of the total. <74>  

<73-74>  

**Summary**  

The article presents a statistical overview of the age distribution among government officials and party members in China during the late 1920s, highlighting that the leadership is predominantly composed of individuals in their 30s and 40s. This demographic representation illustrates the youthful aspect of the National Government. For historians studying the period, this data reveals the generational shift occurring within Chinese politics as younger leaders began taking prominent roles following the revolution, reflecting broader social transformations and the aspirations of a new China.

예를 들자면 한이 업겟거니와 이만하면 靑年政府의 名色이 나타난 줄로 안다. 以上中에 50세 이상은 譯延闓 하나 박게 업거니와 中央委員 전부를 통하야 60세 이상이 吳稚*(65) 林禁(67) 蔡元培(60) 趙載文(62) 뿐이요 張靜江이 56세일 뿐이다. 기타 전부가 30대 혹은 40대인 것은 무엇보다도 청년 중국의 면목을 나타낸다. 다시 시험으로 당원 통계는 발표된 것이 업스니까 발표된 자중에서 임의로 二, 三縣을 抄記하면
江西省寶山縣 (黨員 354 명)
연령         인수       %
15-19        34        9.01
20-24        75       19.88
25-29        93       24.65
30-34        90       23.85
35-39        32        8.48
40-44        24        6.36
45-           6        1.59

즉 30 이상을 다시 합하야도 전체의 1할 5분 박게 안이 된다.

江蘇省海門縣 (黨員 493 명)
연령         원수      %
15-19        86       17.44
20-24       139       28.22
25-29       126       26.58
30-34        71       14.41
35-39        30        6.09
40-44        41        8.32
45-           0        0.00

40세 이상은 1인도 업고 35세 이상이 약 1할 5분-前과 갓다.

南京特別市黨部 (黨員 2727 명)
연령             원수
15-20            765
21-25            980
26-30            811
31-35            346
36-40            275
41-45             92
45-50             56
51-55             14
56-                6

이 통계의 백분비는 독자 諸軍의 自作 算出에 막겨둔다. 오직 40세 이상의 당원이 중앙정부 소재지니 만치 다수나 그래도 겨오 전체의 7분에 지나지 못한다.<74>
<73-74>
