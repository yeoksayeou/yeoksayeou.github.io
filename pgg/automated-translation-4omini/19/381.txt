We are soliciting stories for 『서울갓다가 속은이약이』 (Seoul Gatda Soeun Iyak). Please send in any instances, big or small, where you have been deceived. We will carefully revise the text and publish it. Deadline is the end of July.

**Summary**

This article requests submissions of personal experiences of being deceived for publication in a magazine, highlighting societal attitudes towards deception and the sharing of personal narratives during the colonial period. Such submissions could reveal collective sentiments concerning trust and betrayal under colonial rule, as well as the community's response to various forms of deception prevalent in society at that time. Historians might find this document interesting for its insight into public discourse and personal storytelling as a form of resistance or reflection amidst the colonial experience.
