Big Prize Question Regarding White Rice  
Please answer quickly and understand it well within the deadline.  

In the photograph at the top of this booklet, look closely at the Western actress among the four women. The naked woman in the middle—who is she among them? (If you pay attention to her eyes, nose, and mouth, you will find out.)  

▽Those who know the answer should cut out the paper below and write the name of the actress on it, along with your address and name, and send it in an envelope by July 15.  

▽From those who respond, 100 winners will receive a specially made prize from our company, and one person will be selected by lottery to receive a bag of superior white rice. (If you are in a local branch office, the prize will be sent as cash.) <183>
