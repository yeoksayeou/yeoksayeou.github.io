Observation Car

◇ The Church and Film

In the church of Conway, Iowa, USA, there is a discussion about closing the church since there are too few attendees for worship. A proposal by one of the clever committee members was adopted, suggesting to attract more people by showing moving pictures. Suddenly, the church was transformed into a motion picture theater equipped with a screen and a projector, and it became crowded every evening, collecting offerings at the entrance while viewers watched the scenes and prayed to God. The church finances apparently improved significantly.

◇ Children Drinking Whiskey

On the small British island of Abaco in the state of Florida, USA, it is reported that women, children, and even patients each consume about two liters of whiskey per year, showing a tendency to increase. Nevertheless, the islanders, the recipients of this alcohol, seem not to show any signs of indulgence, although there are constantly vessels and steamships arriving from the United States, which is a prohibition country!

◇ Kaiser Mustache

A mustache turned up at both ends is referred to as a Kaiser-style mustache. This mustache was invented by Prince Ferdinand von Hohenzollern in the 1890s. In Germany, one could not presume to hold oneself without a Kaiser-style mustache. However, with the downfall of the German Empire, this mustache also fell out of fashion, and it has become rare to see except on the faces of elderly men. Consequently, even those who would accumulate wealth by inventing mustache grooming apparatuses, like the famous Happy Prince, fell into dire straits.

◇ Snake Skin Raincoat

In London, for the past three or four years, everyday items made from snake skin have become very popular. Additionally, various products such as Western shoes and handbags have quietly emerged. However, recently, much research has been conducted again, successfully leading to the manufacture of excellent raincoats. Looking at these raincoats, they are certainly not ugly, and their elegant appearance does not seem to be dampened by rain.

◇ World Population Survey

The statistical data regarding the world’s population after the Great War is currently being compiled by the League of Nations in Geneva. Among these findings, the population figures are particularly interesting. The world population was 1.88 billion in 1913, which had increased to about 1.93 billion by the end of 1926, an approximate increase of 7 percent. Geographically, this distribution shows that Asia has 1.26 billion, Europe 514 million, America 232 million, Africa 146 million, and Australia 9 million people.

◇ New Motto of Women

In the Egyptian women's rights expansion movement, the new motto states, "Married men, regardless of social status, each should tattoo the likeness of their wife on their arms.”

◇ American Students Earning Money

It is famous that American students work during their spare time while studying. Last year (1928), it was revealed that about one-third of the students at Yale University earned a total of $594,180. Among them, a single student earned as much as $3,000! This included various jobs such as peddling, selling dishes, cleaning, and window stealing, etc.

◇ Suspension of Execution

The Minister of Justice of the German Republic announced that the new criminal law being drafted by the government would abolish the death penalty. He published a notice to all national courts and prisons requesting a suspension of executions until the new code is enacted. As a result, in practice, death sentences are now halted.

◇ Animal Brain Matter

According to a presentation by Professor Weigand at the Natural Science Conference in Hamburg, it was reported that the brain matter of a whale weighs about 7,000 grams, while the average male human brain is about 1,280 grams, and the female brain is 1,040 grams, averaging about 1,340 grams for both genders.

**Summary**  

This article encapsulates a variety of societal observations from the late 1920s, ranging from innovative practices within churches to issues of alcohol consumption and women's rights movements. Notably, the incorporation of film into church activities reflects changing social dynamics and an effort by institutions to adapt to modernity. Historians may find the discussions around alcohol, particularly in relation to prohibition, revealing of the American cultural landscape during this period, as well as the evolving roles and expectations of women which resonate in modern contexts.
