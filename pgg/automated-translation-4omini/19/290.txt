At the time of my youth, if I were to recount something that was truly exhilarating, it would certainly be about the incident in which, at the age of 21, I punished corrupt officials in Pyongyang. I joined the Donghak (Eastern Learning) religious movement at age 20, which was the year of Gyeimyo. In the following year, the Russo-Japanese War broke out, sweeping through the eastern political landscape, and in Korea, until that time, we had been unable to oppose the government's oppression, which had been secretly tormenting us for over 40 years. The Donghak Party revamped its policies and, under the banner of a legitimate political party called the Jinbuhoe (Progressive Party), held its inaugural meeting in September of the Gyeachin year (1904). 

Despite facing numerous challenges leading up to the meeting, we managed to gather a crowd of 20,000 and called upon the governors of the 44 provinces in Pyongan-do, who had no choice but to lower the flags and accept all our conditions. As a result, Mr. Ra Yong-hwan became the president, with more than 30 members including councilors and inspectors. At that time, I also became a council member, and when someone asked what council members did, I responded that it was a position similar to that of an observer in the Office of Observation, considering it a decent position, though I had no clear understanding of the responsibilities. Nevertheless, at that point, council members held more power than those in the Office of Observation.

When the Progressive Party was inaugurated, seven main policies were announced, including: 1. Cutting hair, 2. Wearing black clothes, 3. Establishing schools, 4. Reforming government corruption, 5. Redressing public grievances, 6. Clarifying the ideals of the great road, and 7. Supporting the country and ensuring public safety. Following this, when we began the total attack on the observatory, after Lee Jung-ha, the Pyongan observer, surrendered, the Donghak military's headquarters, which was a civilian gathering place, resembled a police station, whereas the major Donggang area resembled a prison.

Under the pretext of my birthday, we apprehended the governor of Sunan-gun, Han Hyung-ro, for collecting money from the public, and punished the culprit who had raped a widow and unjustly administered a few thousand nyang in bribed gold. We also dealt with the governor of Gangdong-gun, Oh, who was known for unfair trials, after giving him a beating. Additionally, we punished the Daedong gun's governor who prohibited logging at the Changdong School Forest managed by the Donghak military, making him publicly apologize while bearing the wooden stick to signify that he had committed a fault. 

We also detained one person who came from Seoul with the title of special envoy from the Royal Palace, collecting 1 won and 50 jeon from each household. Another individual who was a seller of soy sauce, Kim Myung-je, also came from Seoul and was similarly drowned in Daedonggang River. Finally, we apprehended Hong Jong-sun, a chief surveyor, who had beaten a man for killing a chicken in the neighboring home, thoroughly punished him, and expelled him from his position.

						李敦化
내가 청춘시대에 뎨일 통쾌하엿든 일을 말하라면 내가 21세 때에 平壤서 탐관오리를 懲治식히든 일일 것이다. 東學에 入敎하기는 20세 - 癸卯년이엿는대 그 이듬해 甲辰년에는 日露戰爭이 닐어나서 東洋風雲을 흽쓸엇고 朝鮮 안에서는 이 때까지 정부의 壓迫을 못닉이어 40여년 동안 隱道로 나려오든 東學黨이 정책을 刷新하야 進步會라는 당당한 일대 정당의 旗ㅅ발을 달고 甲辰년 9월을 기하야 개회를 하엿다. 개회까지는 모든 난관이 만헛지만 2만명 군중을 招集하야 平安道 44州 守令을 號令하엿는지라. 할 수 업시 관헌에서 降旗를 들고 모든 조건을 승인하엿다. 그리하야 羅龍煥 氏가 회장이 되고 평의원과 司察이 30여명이 낫다. 나는 그 때 평의원이 되엿는대 누구더러 평의원이 무엇 하는 것이냐고 물은 즉 觀察府主事가튼 벼슬이라고 해서 이게 조흔 벼슬이라고 그것을 단엿다. 평의원이 무엇 하는 것인지도 몰랏지만 그 때 그 판에는 觀察府主事 이상의 권리엿섯다.
進步黨이 개회되자 一, 斷髮 二, 黑衣着用 三, 學校設立 四, 官弊를 革新 五, 民怨을 雪寃 六, 大道를 彰明 七, 輔國安民의 七條 政綱이 발표되엿다. 그리고 나서 觀察府 總襲擊을 할 적에 平安觀察使 李重夏가 階下에 나려 항복한 후에는 民衆會所인 東學軍 本營은 완연이 警視廳이엿스며 大洞江은 형무소이엿다.
생일을 빙자하야 民財를 거두웟다는 順安郡守 韓亨魯를 잡어 懲治하고, 과부를 强姦한 범인에게 몃 천 량 不正金을<62> 바더먹고 불공평한 재판을 해주엇다는 江東郡守 吳某를 잡어다 주리때꾹을 먹이고 공평한 재판을 해 주든 일이며 東學軍이 경영하는 昌東學校林의 伐採를 금지한 大同郡守를 負荊謝罪 식히든 일이며 宮內府國旗派員이라고 京城으로서 나려와서 한 개에 1원 50전 式하는 것을 민가 各戶에 강제로 징수하는 方主事라는 자와 역시 京城서 왔다는 麴子都賣委員 金明濟라는 궐자를 한가지로 大洞江 물에 묵어 거넛튼 일이며 이웃집 닭 잡어 먹엇다고 소송하는 사람을 도로 잡어다가 볼기 때려보낸 洪總巡이란 작자를 잡어다가 다발경을 치이고 免職 逐出 식히든 일 가튼 것은 도뎌히 그 후로는 보기 어려웟다.<63>
