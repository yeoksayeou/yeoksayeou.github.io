While working aboard the military ship, two sailors, who had lost their footing, were falling. Even as they were plummeting, their concern was, "If we're going to fall, let's make sure to be on the deck where there aren't any oil barrels coming through; if we fall slowly, we'll end up covered in oil from the barrels that are coming down." <137>

  
**Summary**  

The article humorously captures the anxiety of sailors aboard a military ship as they face an unfortunate fall. Despite the situation's severity, the sailors prioritize avoiding a greater mess by worrying about landing in restricted areas. This anecdote reflects the day-to-day realities and unpredictable dangers faced by laborers during Korea's colonial period, shedding light on the human experience amid adversity. Historians may find the depiction of sailors’ lives and their humor in dire situations insightful when examining the impact of colonial rule on Korean identity and labor conditions.
