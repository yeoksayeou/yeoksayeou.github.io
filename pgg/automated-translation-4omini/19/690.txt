First summer has come. The world of fresh greenery is brilliant. The tall trees in Changgyongwon that once captivated the leisure class of hundreds of thousands seem to have disappeared from people's memories. On one day, the white clouds scattered, and after the green shade arises, the atmosphere of the season is formed by the deep black wind and earthy scent, while the purple trees spread their rich green oil across the full canvas. The background where a cicada sings atop a pine tree could also perhaps not be long until forgotten.

Ah! Summer has arrived.—  
Everything is a seed of growth and development—summer has come. The world will begin to grow from this moment; people, animals, trees, and grass—everything flourishes—how can I be immersed in melancholy without laughing even once? Thinking of the icy air in a winter room that can indicate below minus fifteen or sixteen degrees, the summer feels as if it has come for me—how wonderful it feels.

Ah! Those who were once on the corner of the bell tower, the people who were hitting the double-slit windows from the announcement board of Gyeongseong (Seoul)—where have they gone? (They were not simply drug addicts.) I want to grab their wrists and sing the joys of summer together.

Ah! Summer has come. The great round sun throws an immense amount of heat onto the earth, enough to boil the waters of the Pacific Ocean. Oh, how delightful. Everything thrives. The blood in my heart bubbles inside my veins.

However, as spring goes and summer comes, is there any change in the relationship between people and people—whatever that relationship may be? No. The longer the sunlight lasts, the longer the time looks as if it is extending. The merciless moneylenders are busy sucking the weak blood of millions of starving people—while the sweat of factory laborers flows even more abundantly. As I rode on the rickshaw coming from Interbook to the Medical University Hospital, I heard the sound of my driver panting uphill, and I didn’t have the courage to look at his face straight on! I am a sinner. On the long summer days, under the harsh sun, why can’t I carry out true diligence in everything?

(1929, May 7, without any organization) <162>  

**Summary**  

The article reflects the author's thoughts and observations as summer arrives, contrasting the simplicity of nature's growth with the harsh realities of urban life during the colonial period in Korea. The author laments the unchanged relationships among people amidst the sweltering summer, nodding to the socio-economic struggles faced by the working class as moneylenders continue to exploit the impoverished. This sentiment hints at the broader struggles of colonial Korea, where despite the vibrancy of nature, societal issues persist, showcasing the disconnect between an idealized summer and a grim socio-economic reality, a topic that historians might find insightful regarding class and colonial dynamics.

첫녀름(斷想)
						方漢旻
벌서첫녀름이왓다. 新綠의 世界가열니엿다. 數十萬有閑階級의 男女를 熱狂케하든 昌慶苑의뻣나무꼿도 이제는사람사람의 記憶에서 사라저바린모양. 하날에는 白雲 따에는 綠陰期가한번나리인뒤으로 흑군흑군한바람과 흙내음새가 期節의 雰圍氣를이루운가운대 포푸라나무널다른입새가 翠綠의기름을 全幅에흘닌다 松上一蟬鳴의 情境이버러질것도 압흐로머지안니한것을본다.

아! 鍾閣모퉁이거적속에서 든사람 京城府揭示板미테서쌍봐를치든사람―그들은어데로갓슬가?(그들은아편장이는아니엿다) 나는그들의손목을잡고한가지녀름의 歡喜를부르짓고십다.
아! 녀름이왓다. 크고둥그른 太陽이 太平洋물을 沸騰식힐만콤 多量의 熱을 大地우에던진다 오 깃브다. 모―든것은무럭무럭큰다. 내 心藏의피가부글부글끌어가늘은 血管을다름질한다.
