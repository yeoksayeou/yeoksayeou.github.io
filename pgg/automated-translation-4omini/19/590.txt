To the readers who embrace 별건곤: As readers who appreciate the universe, those who have yet to see the "Children" magazine are earnestly requested to do so. Even those who have previously seen it should be encouraged to take a look at the "Children" June issue. The establishment has been striving with sincerity despite the numerous standards to meet. The printing techniques, compared to foreign magazines, are not lacking, and the content is esteemed according to the consensus of the world. Accordingly, not only within households but also in various schools domestically and abroad, efforts are being made to distribute it. If one thinks that "Children" is meant solely for the young, this would be a significant misunderstanding. After giving it a read, elders will also understand the taste of nurturing one's character. Please request it with eleven postage stamps. <153>

**Summary**

This article serves as a promotional message encouraging readers to explore the "Children" magazine, emphasizing its value not just for the youth but also for adults, highlighting the significance of character education through its content. This reflects early 20th-century Korean efforts to cultivate a cultured and educated society even under Japanese colonial rule. Historians may find the emphasis on character development and the availability of such educational material revealing of the social aspirations during a period marked by colonial challenges.
