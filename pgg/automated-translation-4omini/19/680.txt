New Green  
						Lee Tae-jun  
Although I have long admired the flowers, I adore the new green even more. Perhaps those who do not feel any longing while listening to the sound of rain pattering against the wooden pillow are heartless people. However, I would much rather quietly gaze upon the path where new green has spread more elegantly than look upon the flowers for a long time.  

When early this morning the sky cleared, the fallen blossoms, bright as they were, danced gently in the golden sunlight and the clear breeze, and the green leaves were swaying lightly. Looking up at them fills me with endless gratitude for being alive and the joy of existence fluttering within me in youthful vigor.  

I do not know whether it is the allure of the enchanting flowers that makes one feel so lonely that it is unbearable to hold onto someone's wrist. It was like flailing around in desperation, unable to find a place for my heart to settle. Despite my efforts to regain self-discipline, the tranquility of my heart slipped away, but the new green remained untouched. In my heart that harbors no bitterness, the beautiful memories of childhood linger, echoing in the thrum of my own pulse, an enlightening recognition of myself. To interact and converse with nature quietly is indeed a grace granted only to the lonely wanderer beneath the new green, and I consider it a great blessing one can possess.  

Someone once said they wanted to die under an autumn sky. When I see the new green, any desire to live arises within me. When I place my ear against the tree trunk, I can hear the sounds of water bubbling up as if brimming with energy. Gazing upon the bright, newly verdant foliage still shielded from shadows, it feels as though my heart is filled with the melancholic hues of sadness. 

In the mundane life where people only glance at the cement roads and bicker over trifles, letting emotions flare and fray the nerves of one another, such thoughts are indeed cumbersome and unfortunate. To use limited wisdom to pretend to know others is the path to courting resentment and injury to others' feelings, leading to regret.  

The only thing that can provide such fresh vitality to people is indeed the new green.  

I find true tranquility in quietly walking beneath the new green while listening to the songs of the small birds more than in any grand book or sermon. It truly provides a remarkable education. If I were to compare it, while fame can be thought of as a mere courtesan, the new green could be likened to a passionate and healthy young mother, embodying both romantic love and maternal love.  

Just this morning, I climbed South Mountain (南山) and witnessed a profoundly aged gentleman dressed in a worn formal coat. He held his arms high, free from restraint, exhibiting a somewhat heartwarming manner as he energetically moved his limbs.  

Whenever anyone gazes upon the new green, they cannot help but feel overwhelming gratitude toward nature and a sense of happiness about their own life and its resounding vitality.  

From ancient times, the new green has saved countless sinners invisible to human eyes. It has saved many weak individuals whom society overlooks. If people in this world could sincerely look upon the new green, if they could seize such opportunities, I cannot help but imagine how happy they would feel without needing to go to school or church.  

The new green is the springtime of the natural world. Those who see the new green, along with the birds that see it, are invigorated. To live with the vigor of the new green is truly essential; one cannot overlook their own happiness and energy.

**Summary**  

The essay reflects on the beauty and vitality of new green foliage in nature, portraying it as a source of life, joy, and tranquility. Lee Tae-jun contrasts this refreshing experience with the mundane and often contentious aspects of daily life. The notions of nature providing solace and strength are parallel to a yearning for deeper emotional and spiritual connections, perhaps a commentary on the hardships faced under colonial rule. Historians might find interest in the emotional resonance with nature as a form of escape or solace amid the oppressive realities of colonial Korea.

						李泰俊
도좃타 그러나 나는보다도 新綠이더욱좃타. 비뿌리는소리에 木枕을 곳구면서도 꼿이훗터질것을 앗가워하지안는사람은 無情한사람일딘지도몰은다 그러나 나는 꼿을더오래보는것보다 어서新綠이욱어진길을고요히거러보고십다.

新綠은 太古時代부터 사람의눈이보지못하는 數만흔 罪人을 救해냇슬것이다  사람의재조가곳치지못하는 數만흔 弱한사람을 救해냇슬것이다.
이 世上사람들이 누구나 그 率直한마음으로 新綠을바라볼수잇다면 누구에게나 그와갓흔 機會가잇다면 우리는 學校에가지안코 敎堂에가지안이도얼마나 幸福스러울딘지몰을것이다.
新綠은 自然界의 靑春이다 新綠을보는사람 新綠을보는새들은 기운이난다
