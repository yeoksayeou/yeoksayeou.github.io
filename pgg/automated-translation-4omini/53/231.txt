不得已揭載못한 原稿  

In this article, the author critiques the proposal of self-sufficient farming that has been put forward by certain agricultural reform advocates. The author believes that such ideas, while seemingly beneficial, fail to consider the complexities of agricultural economics and the social structures in place. The shortcomings of these proposals are laid out methodically, emphasizing the need for a more nuanced approach rather than simplistic solutions that may ultimately harm the very farmers they aim to aid. 

The author expresses frustration at the superficial understanding of agriculture demonstrated by some of the reformers, suggesting that their lack of real-world experience with the struggles of farmers leads to misguided policies. The piece serves as both a critique and a call for more informed discussions around agricultural reform, advocating for policies that address the actual conditions on the ground. 

The article is a reflection of the broader debates surrounding agriculture and social policy during the colonial period in Korea, implying a critique not only of individual proposals but of the colonial administration's approach to agricultural reform.
