Modern-Fukudobō (Former Modern)  
What is so-called sanctity? - A female standing statue that emerged from the Japan Youth Hall -  
The statue of a woman by Mr. Katō, which was specially selected for this year's Empire Exhibition, was donated by the Japan Youth Hall as a symbol of hope, but since it dealt with the female nude body, it eventually returned to its owner. The reason, reportedly, was the strong protests from several individuals claiming that "it tarnishes the sanctity of the Youth Hall." It is disconcerting that such incidents occur openly in a first-class country that boasts about its cultural level being different from that of Europe and America. Look at the masterpieces of ancient Greek or Roman art; did they ever face rejection because they dealt with the nude body? What does it mean to say it transgresses sanctity? Is it merely because it is a female nude figure that they associate it with lascivious impulses? Hahaha. If the youth flocking to the so-called Youth Hall are those who indulge in such art and if they are to be likened to idiotic perverse patients, how can we ever think of this time being noble? Oh, you sacred moral gentlemen who ruin the era!

The crude class struggle of the old style  
For the past twenty years, I have sincerely observed the house of a certain wealthy gentleman in Seoul, and the seventy-year-old old farmer Seo Heo-jun of Suwon has, without any reason, seen his tenant land reduced by half this time. Because of that, he could not survive; he had complained of his former conditions and made a blood oath against the wealthy gentleman, but it was all in vain. One night, while staying at the landlord's house, he was unable to sleep, tossing and turning, and when dawn arrived, he blamed the landlord and left with the provisions he had taken. He is said to have gone to the path of the afterlife. When the youth would have protested with clenched fists and tried to unite in tenant disputes, alas, they have grown old and weepingly lament their fate. What change can there be? But he, with a grudge against the landlord, died without leaving behind hatred for his children and nephews. Surely he would not leave a thousand-year resentment for them. It is frightening how that thousand-year resentment might erupt in some form later on. The words of the old father who died an untimely death were not anything like a tragic and powerful last testament!

A middle school principal's educative lesson (What I saw in the car)  
Principal Lee Yun-joo, in charge of a public primary school, took a car and sat next to a Japanese person. When it became a bit uncomfortable, he said to the guest, "Please move over a little."  

Japanese: "What do you mean, move over?"  
Lee: "What?!"  
Japanese: "I need to lie down, so just move over a little, will you?"  
Lee: "You, who do not understand public morality, tell me to move over just because you want to lie down!"  

However, the next remark of the Japanese was a great masterpiece.  
Japanese: "You should know who it is that educated you and made you able to speak Japanese like this. You should be thankful. You are the reason for Koreans suffering!"  

Haha, I was at a loss for words! There’s no need to write Principal Lee's reply.  

Later, it turned out that the speaker was a principal of an ordinary school and that he seemed the type to seize what others have and make a fuss, saying, "You dirty one, just get used to the fact!"  

The drunkard’s witty retort (What I saw in the car)  
On the express train to Busan, a drunken man, around fifty, hurriedly boarded. From the moment he entered, he seemed to take charge of the conversation. "Excuse me, would you take a look at my ticket? I am going to Suwon, but I came to Yongsan. Is it alright to be on this train? Even so, I have two sons studying in Seoul. Although I don't know Japanese, is it still fine to be on this train?"  

The entire passenger compartment responded cheerfully that it was fine, leading to laughter. Then, a young man in the adjacent seat suddenly thought about playing around and asked him, "Where are you from?"  
Drunkard: "I’m from Joseon. Where are you from?"  
Young man: "I’m from Japan."  
Drunkard: "Oh, you live in Japan? It seems you are here to mock me, huh! You from Japan speak Korean?!"  
Young man: "Why do you think it's inappropriate to speak informally to me?"  
Drunkard: "Oh, saying it's informal just because you're living in Japan? How ridiculous! You think I don’t know you are talking about me like a country bumpkin? In the late Joseon period, even a servant from Pohang could pass examinations, and nowadays it's just a joke!"  

The whole compartment burst into laughter, finally leading to the old man being accepted by everybody. In the end, they all made it clear to him that they were just listening and understanding his situation.  

Young man: "You seem quite drunk; stop it already. I said I passed examinations yesterday, and it’s just a cycle of injustice!"  
Drunkard: "What useless words are you saying? Where might you have learned such words? Joseon is a country of Eastern mannerisms; you should respect that. Do you understand what respect is? It’s about keeping yourself proper and not urinating in public!"  

Everyone: "?" Hahaha. Everyone burst into laughter.
