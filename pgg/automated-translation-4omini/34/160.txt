Question and Answer Record 9

The reporter mentioned that you are very enthusiastic about ice skating. How many hours do you practice each day? 

On days off from school, I start at nine o'clock in the morning and usually continue until nine o'clock at night. That means I practice for about 12 hours a day. If we were to convert it in terms of distance traveled on ice, it would be around five to six hundred li (里) without doubt. <60>  

 
**Summary**  

This piece highlights the dedication to ice skating by Lee Il, who practices for long hours, reflecting a deep commitment to the sport. The mention of practicing for up to 12 hours a day showcases not only personal dedication but may also hint at the cultural influence and growing interest in Western sports during the Japanese colonial period in Korea. Historians might find it of particular interest as it represents a shift in leisure activities and the adoption of new physical cultures during this time.
