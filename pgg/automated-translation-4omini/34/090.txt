Question and Answer Record 2  

Shin Albeote   

What was the most significant event for you while managing the school?  

I believe it was the recognition of our school. As you are well aware, our school has only about ten years of history, but due to various deficiencies, we were unable to obtain the qualification for a lecture institution until last year. However, through diligent efforts, we finally received the qualification to be recognized as a school last March, and there has never been a more delightful event for me than that.  

**Summary**  

This article features a dialogue with Shin Albeote, who reflects on the challenges faced by his school in achieving official recognition, which took over a decade. The conversation highlights the struggles of educational institutions in Korea during this period of colonial rule, and Shin’s feelings of relief and joy upon finally overcoming bureaucratic hurdles may reflect broader themes of resilience among Korean educators of the time. Historians might find the emphasis on official recognition significant, as it indicates how colonial policies shaped the struggle for educational legitimacy in Korea.
