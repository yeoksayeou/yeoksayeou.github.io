The second implementation of the Transportation Survey has shown a greatly successful turnout, exceeding the expectations and excitement of our readers. The scene of the day cannot be described in detail here, but it was filled with many unique anecdotes and humor.

The number of participants exceeded fifty thousand, but regrettably, there was not a single contestant with the correct answer, with the closest answers differing by as much as thirty people. Certainly, one could say that they were impressively accurate numbers.

The awards were granted to ten winners who were relatively close to the correct number, and the prizes will be traditional long jackets (周衣, jooeui).
