In the book 『神仙傳』 (Shin Seon Jeon), there is a story about the creation of the world. When Pangu (盤古) died, all things arose from his body. It states that when "Pangu died, the clouds became the winds, the sounds became the thunder, his sweat and tears became the rain and dew, his eyes became the sun and moon, his four limbs and five bodily functions became the five mountains, his blood and viscera became the rivers, lakes, and seas, his tendons became the roads, his hair became the grass and trees, his bones became the metals and stones, his flesh became the fields and soil, and the lice that infested his body became the people." This account of humanity's origin is indeed a masterpiece.

  
**Summary**
