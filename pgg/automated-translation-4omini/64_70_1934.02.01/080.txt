The Six Clans of Silla  

Silla originally consisted of six clans from Geoncheon, Yangsan Village, Tteolsan, Gohwang Village, Musan, Galigun Village, and Myeonghwal Mountain. During the reign of King Yu Ri, the names were changed and surnames were assigned. The Uyang Mountain clan became the Yang clan and was given the surname Lee; the Gohwang clan became the Sallyang clan and was given the surname Choi; the Daeju clan became the Jeomyang clan (also known as Mul-Ryang) and was given the surname Son; the Ganjin clan became the Beonbi clan and was given the surname Jeong; the Galigun clan became Hanji clan, and was given the surname Bae, while the Myeong萯 clan became the Jangbe clan and was given the surname Seol, so these are the six surnames of Silla.  

Additionally, Gaya had six Gaya territories: the main state was Gim Guk Gaya (Gimhae), while the others were Ara Gaya (Haman), Guneung Gaya (Haman), Dae Gaya (Goryeong), Seongsan Gaya (Seongju = Beokjin), and So Gaya (Goseong). The Gaya harp, which is passed down in the folklore today, is a remnant of this Gaya kingdom.  

**Summary**  

This article provides an overview of the various kingdoms that existed during the Three Han period, detailing the specific names and attributes of the Mahan, Jinhan, and Byeonhan kingdoms. It also outlines the six clans of Silla and their historical significance. The mention of these kingdoms reveals the complexity of early Korean political structures, which may interest historians studying the region's development and cultural evolution during the ancient period.
