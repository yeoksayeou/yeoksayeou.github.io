Let's go for mountain greens, new folk song  
						By Lee Suikyu  

Eeyara, dee-yara  
Let's go to gather mountain greens  
In pink skirts and red flowers,  
The eldest sister collects them.  
With a flower basket on her arm,  
Let's skip over the mountain.  

Eeyara, let's go for mountain greens  
Through all the valleys and hills,  
The maiden collects the angelica,  
Snipping it with her comb,  
Whether a tiger (the tiger lily) or a beast,  
Is roaming around.  

Eeyara, dee-yara  
Let's go gather mountain greens,  
Whether we gather greens or not,  
Let's delight in spring on the mountain,  
With our flower baskets on our arms,  
Let's skip over the mountain. <2>  

Eeyara, dee-yara  
Let's gather through all the valleys,  
Let's abandon the yam and millets,  
And pick the spring herbs,  
How joyous it is  
To fill our baskets with wildflowers.  

Eeyara, dee-yara  
Let's go gather mountain greens,  
Even if the branches of the yuzu tree  
Are full of blossoms,  
In our children's hearts,  
Is there not anxiety emerging?  

Eeyara, let's go for mountain greens  
Through all the valleys and hills,  
The heart of the spring maiden,  
Is it like the drunk moonbeam?  
Just by seeing the twin flowers,  
She gets intoxicated.

**Summary**

山나물가자, 新作民謠
						李瑞求
에여라 듸여라
山나물 캐러가자
분홍치마 당홍당귀
수집은 큰아가씨
꼿바구니 장도차고
아장아장 山을 넘자.

에여라 산나물 가자
이골저골 차자를들자
숫처녀 당귀를
꼿빗만 녁이는가
호랑나븨 떼저
나라든다.

에여라 듸여라
山나물 캐러가자
나물이야 캐든마든
봄노리 산에가세
꼿바구니 장도차고
아장아장 산을 넘자. <2>

에여라 듸여라
이골저골 차저를 들자
삽주나 밀대는
다제처 노와두고
사히조흔
벗꼿따서 담세

에여라 듸여라
산나물 캐라가자
유자나무 가지에도
불빗이 가득커든
우리애기 가슴엔들
아즐아즐 불안올가.

에여라 山나물 가자
이골저골 차저를들자
봄처녀 가슴은
술마신 달빗인가
쌍나븨만 봐도
취한다네.
