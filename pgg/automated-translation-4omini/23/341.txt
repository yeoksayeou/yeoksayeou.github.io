謝告  
In this issue, we regret to inform our readership that the serialized talk '아츰' (A-chum), which is published every month, was to be continued by Hong Myeong-hui (洪命憙) this time. However, due to an unforeseen incident at the editorial office, he was unable to complete the writing. Therefore, we could not include the continuation this time.＜163＞  

**Summary**  

This brief notice apologizes to readers for the absence of the expected installment of the serialized talk due to unforeseen circumstances involving the author Hong Myeong-hui. Such moments reflect the unpredictability of editorial work during the colonial period in Korea, providing insight into the challenges faced by writers and publications at the time. This could be of particular interest to historians analyzing the cultural and social dynamics of Korean literature amidst colonial rule, emphasizing the fragility of artistic endeavors.
