**Summary**

The article announces a grand prize contest in a New Year's issue aiming to engage readers, particularly children, through illustration challenges. It reflects the period's efforts in publishing and engaging the youth during the colonial era in Korea, showcasing the influence of Japanese culture on the burgeoning Korean publishing industry. Historians might find it noteworthy that such contests were a way to instill cultural engagement and possibly divert attention from the broader political situation in Korea during Japanese rule.
