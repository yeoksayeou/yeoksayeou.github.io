**Summary**  

This article invites readers to contribute to a column designated for postcard communication, emphasizing the importance of freedom in the contents shared, ranging from personal thoughts to reviews and other information. The notion of welcoming diverse expressions through a simple medium like postcards reflects a desire for cultural exchange and communication during a time of political and social upheaval in Korea under Japanese rule. Historians might find the article interesting for its representation of everyday expressions of individuality and the subtle defiance encapsulated in promoting free expression within colonial confines.
