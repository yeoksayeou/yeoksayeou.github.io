Announcement of New Magazine Publication 

Please take note that the Kaebiksa (開闢社) will be publishing a new magazine. The Kaebik (開闢誌) has not yet received permission, thus it will be published under the title Byeolgeon-Gwon (別乾坤) to reach the general populace, and will also instruct the youth of the nation through the Children (어린이) section. We have decided to launch a students' magazine aimed at male and female students. 

The content will be very modern in style, with articles written as simply as possible. The magazine price will be extremely low so that, of course, middle school students and anyone wishing to advance through life with an attitude akin to that of "baehooneyi" will find it a suitable companion.

Call for Magazine Name 

The new magazine will be published starting next February, and we request you to submit preferred names for the magazine. Names can be two or three characters long. They should be easy to pronounce, concise in writing, and visually appealing.

Call for Names 

Each person can submit up to three suggestions, with the deadline being the end of December. A small reward will be presented to those selected, which will include a two-year subscription to the new magazine for the winners, and a six-month subscription for honorable mentions.

**Summary**  

The article announces the upcoming launch of a new magazine by Kaebiksa in December 1928, designed to appeal to a broad audience, specifically including students and children. The call for submissions for the magazine's name highlights community engagement and the desire for a contemporary, easy-to-access publication. This initiative reflects an effort to promote modern literacy and educational resources during the Japanese colonial period, serving as a noteworthy example of cultural adaptation and resistance within the constraints of colonial rule.
