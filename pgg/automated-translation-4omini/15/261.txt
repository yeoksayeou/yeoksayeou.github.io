Spectacular!! Unprecedented Grand Special!! This Magazine's New Year Issue!!!

A magazine is a competition of newspapers and magazines vying for attention during the New Year issue editing. It is a great clash involving various newspaper and magazine forces!

Just as a heavenly horse flies through the air, what can we expect from the independent scene of the magazine world? Indeed, what shall we see… As a journalist, I assert with confidence that the content, which is being prepared with newly added staff and fresh strategies for the New Year issue special, will definitely be a source of pride — I want to share this with our readers. Previously, there was an extraordinary special editing! More than eighty new articles will be kept a secret until the publication date! Even if one were to pay four or five times the price for such articles, it would be no exaggeration to say that it would be worth it.

Special New Year Supplement Provided for Free... To be Presented by Our Company

Order Notices  
This is, after all, a gift that Byeolgeongon presents for the first time to its readers. It is incomparable and splendid; something you can't buy with money. The price is still fifty-two jeon, and it will be published on December 30—make sure to place your order beforehand for safety's sake before the issues go out of stock… Order it now.

Urgent Notice  
We always welcome contributions to our magazine and will gladly publish them, so if you have a manuscript to send for the New Year issue, please send it by December 12 to ensure it can be printed.  

Regarding New Year Articles, anything is welcome—from anecdotes of the past year, hopes and grievances from various fields to suggestions suitable for New Year's folklore or interesting phenomena. 

Introduction of Local Products and Unique Customs  
Every village has its specialties. These can be goods, people, or objects that are well-known, so please write them down and send them in. Additionally, there are unknown rare customs from various places, especially during the New Year. If you can share those, we will include them in the magazine.
