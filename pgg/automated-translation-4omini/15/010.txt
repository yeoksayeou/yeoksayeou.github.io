**Summary**  

This article describes a contest where readers can identify errors in the photographs of two new reporters and guess their ages for a chance to win a bag of fine white rice. It highlights the interest in embracing new journalism during a time when modernization was happening in Korea. Historians may find it revealing of the cultural shifts occurring in the 1920s, reflecting how colonial publishers were engaging readers in interactive ways that blend entertainment with a sense of community.
