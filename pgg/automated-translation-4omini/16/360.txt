The noble youth, who bore a grudge against his wife, was spending his days drinking at a tavern with a local drunkard. The loyal Samryong took advantage of a moment of respite to quietly sit in the yard and craft a human figure out of the water he had carved. He became mesmerized by the young master's psychology, who bullied the gentle and submissive wife. Unfortunately, his hand slipped with the knife he was using to carve. The kind lady rushed to him and bandaged his bleeding finger. 

When the noble youth got extremely drunk and fell into the Bangchuan (坊川), Samryong heard the news that he had lost consciousness and hurriedly ran to carry his young master on his back and laid him down on his bed. Even while experiencing abuse and contempt, still the loyal Samryong cherished his young master as precious, worthy of life. The devoted wife, who was also kind-hearted, bestowed a small pocket as a gift to the commendable Samryong. Holding the first splendid pocket he had ever received in his life, Samryong was immensely pleased. However, little did he know that this pocket would become a source of trouble...<143>  

**Summary**

This article describes the trials of a loyal servant named Samryong, who endures abuse from his noble master while remaining devoted and caring. A notable element is the contrast between the servant's loyalty and the master's disdain, which culminates in the servant receiving a prized pocket that foreshadows future troubles. Historians examining this piece may find it revealing of class dynamics and the pressures of colonial society in Korea, reflecting the complex relationships cultivated in a period marked by social stratification.
