謝告  
The editorial style of Byeolgeongon (별건곤) aims to be confident and attractive, but this issue has unfortunately not achieved that goal. Due to efforts to publish the New Year issue by the end of the year, we were unable to wait for the photo printing to be completed and had to proceed with what was available. We thought it necessary to do so in order to establish regular publications. Please consider this and forgive us for this issue. <21>  

**Summary**  

In this article, the editorial team of Byeolgeongon acknowledges the imperfections of the current issue due to time constraints in publishing ahead of the New Year. They express a commitment to regular publication but also seek the understanding of their readers for the shortcomings in this edition. This glimpse into the challenges faced by media during the colonial era reflects the pressures of maintaining cultural production amidst constraints, suggesting an effort to uphold local identity against colonial influences. Historians might find the editorial's tone revealing about the aspirations and challenges of Korean cultural production in the late 1920s.
