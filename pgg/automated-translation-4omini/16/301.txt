Second Great Prize Contest of White Rice  
This time, it seems that the previous contest was too difficult, so we will present something a little easier.  

1. How old is the person in the upper photo and how old is the person in the lower photo? (Upper) is an actor, (lower) is a courtesan.  

2. How many ancient historic site illustrations are there in this year's New Year issue of "Children"?  

Please write your answers simply on a postcard-sized piece, clearly stating your address and name. Cut out the "Reader's Certificate" found in this book and send it along with the answers in an envelope.  
(Deadline: January 25)  

Great Prize Contest Rewards  
We will send beautiful souvenirs to 100 winners, and among them, one person will be drawn to receive a sack of high-quality white rice.  

Please write "Manuscript Enclosed" on the envelope containing your answers and send it with a 2-won postage stamp.

**Summary**  

The article details a contest inviting participants to answer two questions about photographs and illustrations, promoting engagement with children's literature. It emphasizes ease compared to previous iterations and offers a draw for a sack of rice as a prize. This reflects the consumer culture of the era and the challenges faced during the colonial period, where such promotional events aimed to engage the Japanese administration's Korean audience and stimulate interest in reading and national identity.
