The fourth year, Byeolgeongon, New Year issue  

On the twenty-fourth of January, the bright moon, the feast is the first full moon of the new year. Millions rejoice together in the streets, and distinguished guests dance in the moonlight. Throughout the four seasons, we admire lanterns and flowers, rejoicing in the celebrations. Is today not a day of happiness for all?

The dragon towers echo the great constellations, lights of ten thousand households embody the full moon of January. Suddenly, the hundred-foot rainbow bridge links thousands in joy.

Last year, on this night, the moonlight spilled upon us, and this year, once again, the full moon greets us. Now I have come to understand that the years change, and the months remain eternal.  

Park Hyogwan  

White snow blankets the universe, making a thousand mountains look like jade. Plum blossoms half-bloom, and bamboo leaves are green. Oh friends, pour us a cup, as we feel the breath of spring.  

Anonymous  

The wind sweeps the snow, softly brushing against the mountain window, while the cold plunders the sleeping plum blossoms. Oh what tenderness can bring forth the essence of spring?
