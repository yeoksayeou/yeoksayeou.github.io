Announcement of Prize Winners from the February Issue  
The announcement of the prize winners for the February issue will be published in this book, but due to the oversight in the selection process, it was necessary to publish it in the March issue of 彗星 (Suisei). Please refer to it. <9>  

**Summary**  

This article serves as an announcement regarding the prize winners from a competition featured in the previous February issue of the magazine. It acknowledges an oversight that led to the delay in revealing the winners, indicating these will instead be published in the following March issue. The editorial note reflects the practices of journalistic accountability and the issues faced in communication during the colonial period. The mention of the competition and the process of selection offers insights into the cultural and literary activities being promoted among Koreans at that time, a vibrant method for engagement despite colonial constraints.
