Untitled  

From the lips of the parakeet  
the words that flutter out  
are chilling as if sliced by a knife,  
yet, how could I not have grasped them?  

All of them were voices  
etched into my bones from loving you,  
and the sacred devotion  
devoted to sacrificing your body, oh, I long for it.  

Ah - how could I be at ease  
with only a heart that feels like it might be swallowed?  
As it surrounds you, encircles you, and turns again,  
I feel pity for you.  

How is it that this devoted soul  
is caught up in the passing of days  
and likewise, does my gaze pass by? <29>  

**Summary**  

This poem by Kim Po-baek captures the pangs of love and longing, expressing a deep emotional connection between the speaker and the subject of their affection through symbolic language and vivid imagery. The themes of devotion, sacrifice, and the struggle with overwhelming emotions resonate strongly in the context of Korean colonial history, reflecting the turbulent feelings of individuals grappling with their identities and relationships under the constraints of colonial rule. Historians might find the emotional depth of the poem significant as it speaks to personal experiences of love against the backdrop of a challenging socio-political landscape.

無題
						金抱白
파라케 질닌 입술에서
마듸 마듸 떠어지는 말은
칼로 여히는 듯 쌀쌀 햇건만
내 엇지 듯지 안엇는가

모다 저를 사랑함으로
골수에 매친 소리엇고
네 몸을 밧치겟다는
거룩한 지성이 사모첫습니다.

아-나는 엇지하야 조흘지
밋칠 듯한 마음만이
그네를 싸고싸고 또 돌면
한업시 그네가 가엽습니다.

엇지하면 밧든 지성을 갑흘가
날자만 헤이고 잇스나
또한 엿봄이나 지나갈는지＜29＞
