기사형태	시 (Poem)  

The white-headed mountain grinds the knife to its end,  

The water of the Duman River drinks the horses without limit.  

A man of twenty has not yet pacified the nation,  

Who of the later generations calls him a great man? <12>  

**Summary**  

This poem expresses a sense of lament regarding the state of the nation and the duty of men to rise and support its liberation. It reflects the sentiments of a young man who feels the weight of responsibility still unfulfilled at the age of twenty. This perspective on youth and national duty points to the broader struggle of Korea under colonial rule during this period, revealing the aspirations and frustrations of those who sought national independence. Historians might find the emphasis on youth and valor interesting, as it speaks to the emerging nationalistic feelings that were brewing among Koreans during Japanese colonialism.
