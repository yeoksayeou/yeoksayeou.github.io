Commemorative 500 Won Grand Prize for Breaking 30,000 Copies  

The public's acclaim toward our magazine has been remarkable, with readers increasing rapidly. We sold out 30,000 copies by the last issue (New Year issue). This is the breakthrough of 30,000 copies in Korea! As a celebration, we are offering a special grand prize of 500 Won as detailed below. Any reader of our magazine can apply.  

New Wedding Ceremony Proposal Collection  

As the times change, traditional wedding ceremonies based on the old style are no longer held in many rural areas. However, a universal new ceremony to replace it has not yet emerged, and it is regrettable that people find themselves in inappropriate places struggling with wedding rituals. To address this, we are widely collecting proposals for a usable wedding ceremony through '별건곤' and '학생' (Student) magazines to provide to the general public.  

Requirements: ◇ Consider that the ceremony is revealed at the wedding venue ◇ Think of guests numbering around one hundred ◇ Budget should be around 100 Won to 500 Won ◇ Consider the attire of the groom and bride  

Regulations: ◇ Manuscript should be around thirty pages ◇ Deadline is April 15 ◇ Please cut out and send the reader's certificate from the magazine's index  

Judging: ◇ The editorial department of our magazine will take responsibility for judging, seeking the cooperation of notable figures in the educational and media sectors to ensure discretion.  

Prizes: 1st Prize 100 Won for one person, 2nd Prize 50 Won for two, 3rd Prize 30 Won for two. (Prize money will be sent within seven days after the proposal's content is published.)  

Call for Childhood Tales and Youth Novels  

We are collecting emotionally resonant true stories or youth novels to appeal to the tens of thousands of young readers of '어린이' (Children) magazine. We earnestly hope that teachers from schools across Korea will contribute, and we encourage young groups and press organizations to submit their works. (However, please note that emotionally charged submissions must pass the scrutiny of the police.)  

Regulations: ◇ Manuscript should be around twenty pages ◇ Written entirely in Korean ◇ True stories should include attached photographs ◇ Deadline is April 15 ◇ Agree to our magazine's editing and corrections  

Prizes: A prize of 10 Won for one selected work, 12 selected works total will amount to 120 Won. (Prize money will be sent within seven days after the selected manuscript is published.)  

Cover Artwork Collection for '학생' Magazine  

Our new magazine '학생' (Student) is for male and female students, and we wish for the cover to feature student artwork. You can choose any month of the year, and it is free to depict either male or female students, but please ensure the magazine represents both genders. The artwork should be lively and spirited.  

Regulations: ◇ Colors must be limited to three shades (Refer to the cover of the student magazine's inaugural issue.) ◇ Deadline is April 15 ◇ Reader's certificate must be attached  

Prizes: For each month's issue, one prize of 10 Won, for a total of 12 issues, amounting to 120 Won for one selected piece.  

**Summary**  

This article celebrates the magazine's achievement of selling over 30,000 copies and announces two competitions: one for new wedding ceremony proposals and another for stories and novels aimed at children and youth. These initiatives seem to reflect a shift toward modernization and cultural adaptation in colonial Korea, showcasing how the magazine sought to engage its readership by promoting new norms and values in both wedding customs and literature. Historians may find interest in how these competitions reveal societal changes and the push for modernity in a colonial context, emphasizing a move away from traditional practices.
