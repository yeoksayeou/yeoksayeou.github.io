特告  
Recently, various magazines have been coming out quietly; our company does not have any relationship with them, yet in order to promote themselves, they have been advertising as if they have an indirect—sometimes direct—relationship with our company, causing confusion to the public and making things difficult for our company. Therefore, we ask you to pay special attention. Currently, the magazines operated by our company are 『別乾坤』, 『어린이』, and the newly published 『學生』.

  
**Summary**  

This special notice from the magazine "별건곤" (Byeolgeon-gon) warns readers about other magazines that falsely claim associations with it to promote themselves. The editorial cautions readers to be discerning, as this misrepresentation could lead to confusion. This article reflects on the competition and publishing environment during the colonial period in Korea, highlighting issues of trust and credibility within the media. Historians might find it interesting as it underscores the challenges faced by Korean publications under Japanese colonial rule.
