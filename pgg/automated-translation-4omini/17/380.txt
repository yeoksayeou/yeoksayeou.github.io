Concept of Chastity  
A: "The so-called concept of chastity in contemporary society is truly a strange thing!"  
B: "Well, if someone doesn't have money, nobody even looks at them." <151>  

 
**Summary**  

This article discusses the concept of chastity in society, highlighting the paradox that economic status influences social perceptions of integrity and virtue. The dialogue between the two speakers reflects a cynical view on how material wealth often overshadows moral ideals like chastity in social interactions. Historians might find interest in the critique of social values during the colonial period in Korea, as it illustrates the tension between traditional beliefs and modern influences in a society coping with external pressures and loss of autonomy.
