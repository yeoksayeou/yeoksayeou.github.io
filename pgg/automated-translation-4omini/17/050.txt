A Document to the Discontented in the World by the Commander of the Peaceful West, Hong Gyeong-rae  
						桂山人  
The fact of Hong Gyeong-rae is generally known, and it has been published several times in this magazine, but his proclamation has not yet been widely published in the world. (Although it was somewhat introduced in this magazine's 15th issue) On December 22 of the 11th year of King Injong, 118 years ago, he circulated his proclamation in all of Gyeongsang-do, which corresponds to February 1 on the solar calendar, and he captured Jeongju Castle on the 2nd day of the first lunar month of the next year, which falls on February 11, a date that coincidentally aligns with the day when Queen Inhyeon was relocated to the Russian embassy. Now, as an article related to the Russian embassy relocation is published in February, this also brings to mind Hong's noteworthy actions, so I intend to present the full text of his proclamation and also a directive for public reference. However, it should be noted that the phrase commonly quoted as “文不過持平掌令하고 武不過萬戶僉使" is not found in this original proclamation, and it is uncertain if it was later added by those with good intentions.

1. Proclamation  
(Published on December 20, 11th year of King Injong)  
The Commander of the Peaceful West proclaims urgently. All fathers and elders of Gyeongsang must listen to this. Indeed, Gyeongsang is the ancient domain of Gi-seong, and the old cave of Dangun. Its clothing and crown are illustrious, and its culture is exceptional. During the Imjin War, it already achieved a remarkable contribution and again in the Dingmyo (仁祖 丁卯胡亂) upheaval, it first demonstrated loyalty at Sangmu and has produced talents in the western soil, yet the court counts the western soil as no different from excrement, and indeed even the sons of great house servants say "He must be a Pyeonghan" upon seeing men from the west. Is this not a deep grievance? If there is to be any respite, it must depend on the Western soil's strength, and if decrees are to be strictly enforced, it must rely on the wisdom of the Western soil. For the past 400 years, what wrong have the westerners done to the court?  

Now observing that the King Chong-wang resides above, and the powers of the traitors grow daily strong as those like Kim Joosun and Bokjoonggyeong secretly manipulate the control of the state, the divine calamities of Heaven have descended, and storms and earthquakes have occurred almost every year; as a result, the great calamity deepens, and famine befalls the land, and the old and weak are suffering in despair, while the common people are nearly at the brink of annihilation.  

How fortunate that a saint who can save the world has descended in the land of Cheongbuk, beneath the mountain of Mt. Suncheon and in Gunwangpo, born as a divine being. At the age of five, he entered China with a holy monk, and when he grew older, he secluded himself in the four counties of Gangjae for five years, leading the heirs of the remnants of the Ming dynasty with ten thousand iron cavalry. This force possesses the aspiration to restore the East and holds this Gyeongsang as its abundant homeland. Unable to bear trampling it, he has sent forth the heroes of Gyeongsang to rise up in arms to save the people, and wherever this righteous flag goes, no one fails to awaken. 

Đ... (here follows the rest, but has been cut off by 24 characters)...  

Open the city gates to welcome our command. If there are those who stubbornly resist, they shall be eradicated without a trace by five thousand iron cavalry, so it is advisable to promptly request a command for the suitable actions. This proclamation is issued to the military officials of Anju, the county governor, the magistrate of Sukcheong, the magistrate of Shinan, the governor of Pyongyang, the central army, the county magistrates, the military governors of Jangsu, the governor of Yeongryu, and stamped with the orders of the Commander of the Peaceful West. After receiving the letter of surrender, Jin Ik-soon of the Anju military would be deprived of his stamp after being sharply imprisoned for a crime of corruption, and Lee Yong-jik, the governor of Gokgang, and Lee Geun-jo, the magistrate of Jeongju would abandon their stamps and flee from the Mongols, while Jeong Soo, the military provider of Gangsan, would be severely punished and executed for excessive greed, and Im Seong-gwa, the governor of the Bogcheon county would be imprisoned harshly for misappropriating treasury funds. Therefore, if any villages have this proclamation relayed, on the day of the military's arrival, their local headman and county magistrate shall strictly carry out the military laws.  

2. Directive  
Those who dwell in caves know the rains, and those who roost in nests know the winds, but those who do not know the heavenly times can be called human? The folly of those who dwell below is greater still. Your name is not the foolishness of the sea, rather you are foolish in a lower sense. Assassins make schemes, where frogs jump about in the well. Yet you wish to learn from Gongsun Zi yet attempt to assassinate but why not target those from your own court instead and only end up targeting mere soldiers? Even the soldiers below are also our Gyeongsang people, so how could they fulfill their duties with true sincerity?  

Those like Lee In-bae of Choi-dae must be executed for being unable to avoid their fates. If there are conspiracies, do not leave the people of Gyeongsang untouched, and if you wish to bolster your walls firmly against order, then do not place the Gyeongsang people on the walls; instead call upon your own wives, concubines, siblings, and slaves to fight together with one heart.  

You are a minister of Seong-ryeok.  
You come from the military’s troubles.  

Even if you know the divine mandate and the hearts of the people, you cannot make a pact beneath the city walls.  

When the great army (the Mongols) captures the castle, I request that you affirm your name, which serves as the honour of a great minister. Recently in the city of Gangsan, Jeong Juk, in Bogcheon, Im Seong-gwa, in Jeongju, Lee Geun-ju, in Gokgang, Lee Yong-jik, in Seong-chung, Kim Ik-soon, in Cheolsan, Lee Jang-gyeong, in Yongcheon, Kwon Soo, and the mayor of Uiju, Jo Heung-jin, and the magistrate of Seokju, Yun Min-dong are rather useless branches on the wind.  

Even though these people know the divine mandate and the hearts of the people, they are still guilty as great ministers.  

If you are adamant about protecting the city and seek ministers of Seong-ryeok, it is certain that they will not be forgiven, for Heaven and man decree that even those of Seong-ryeok may meet the same fate.  

Why wait for suffering from the stone while observing the heavens?  

Wish to invite fortune and spirits, and to be cautious of the hidden enemies? While the delicate maidens of the Gyuduk camp, though indeed cherished among people, are surely products of Gyeongsang, can you know whether they are enemies placed on your ship?  

In the lower chamber of Baekhyang Building, among the soldiers bearing bows and arrows, they are surely products of central Gyeongsang, then how could you not suspect?  

Now then, great ministers, how are you sitting here in the mountains and why do your heads not drop long ago?  

Why not self-reflect?  

To know this, live if you wish and die if you wish to. This is the teaching of Spring and Autumn (春秋) for casting judgment.

**Summary**

This article explores Hong Gyeong-rae's proclamation during a time of political unrest in Korea, reflecting his appeal to the people of Gyeongsang to rise against perceived injustices from the ruling regime. It emphasizes historical grievances and seeks to inspire unity and rebellion for justice. Historians might find the juxtaposition of local autonomy against the backdrop of central authority and the implications of loyalty and identity particularly revealing in the context of Korean colonial history.

一張書로 天下의 不平客을 니르킨 平西 大元師 洪景來檄文
						桂山人
洪景來의 사실은 누구나 대개 알고 본지에도 누차 발표하얏스나 그의 檄文은 아즉까지 세상에 널리 발표된 일이 업섯다. (본지 제15호에 다소 소개되엿지만)그런데 그가 반기를 들고 關西 全道에 檄文을 轉하든 純祖 11년 辛巳(距今 118년전) 12월 22일은 양력으로 2월 1일이고 그가 定州城을 함락하기는 또한 그 익년 壬申 정월 2일 즉 양력 2월 11일인 바 이 2월 11일은 공교히 李太皇 俄館播遷하던 날과 한날이라. 이제 2월 중 발생한 俄館播遷의 기사를 揭載하는 끗헤 또한 洪씨의 일이 생각되기에 그 檄文의 全文과 또 傳令을 발표하야 일반의 참고에 供코자 한다. 然而 世에 전하는 소위 文不過持平掌令하고 武不過萬戶僉使 云云의 句는 이 元檄文 중에는 업슨 즉 후에 好事者가 添入한 지도 不知하겟다.

1. 격문
(純祖 11년 辛未 12월 20일 發布)
平西 大元師는 爲急急馳檄事라. 我關西父老公私之賤은 咸聽此棜하라. 蓋關西는 箕聖古域이오. 壇君舊窟이라. 衣冠이 岌濟하고 文物이 炳烺이라. *在 壬辰之亂에 已有再造之功하고 又於  丁卯(仁祖 丁卯胡亂)之變에 先輸襄武之忠하고 有如遯菴之學과 月浦之才-又是産於西土호대 而朝廷之等棄西土를 不異糞土하야 심지어 甚門奴婢가 見西土之人 則 必曰平漢이라 하니 其爲西土者-豈不寃抑哉아. 若當緩則必賴西土之力하고 且當科時則必賴西土之文하니 400년來에 西人이 有何負於朝廷哉아. 見今冲王이 在上에 權奸이 日熾하야 如金祖淳朴宗慶輩가 竊弄國柄하니 仁天이 降災하야 同雷地震이 殆無虛歲하고 由此로 大無存臻하야 餓*가 載道하고 老弱이 塗炭하며 生民이 盡劉함이 幾乎在卽이로다. 何幸濟世之聖人이 誕降于 淸北宣川仞山日月峰下君王浦上伽倻洞紅衣島하니 生而神靈이라. 五歲에 隨神僧入＜11＞ 中國이러니 旣長에 隱居于江界四郡地閭延五載하야 統領皇明之世臣遺孫하니 鐵騎十萬이라. 隊有澄淸東國之志而維此關西는 卽 豐沛故鄕이라. 不忍感踏하야 先使關西之豪傑輩로 起兵救民하니 義旗所到에 莫不*蘇-ㄹ새 ... ...(이하24字削-원문)... ... 洞開城門하야 以迎我師하라. 若有*爾頑拒者하면 當以鐵騎 5000으로 *之無遺矣리니 宜速請命學行宜當者라. 右檄文은 下安州兵使, *侯, 牧使, 肅川府使, 順安縣令 平壤監司, 中軍, 庶尹, 江西縣令, 三和府使, 咸從府使, 甑山縣令, 永柔懸令하고 大元師著抽蹯印. 宣川府使 金益淳에게는 受降書하고 奪印符後에 推用富民錢罪로 嚴囚하고 郭山郡守 李永植과 定州牧使 李近冑는 棄印符逃元하고 嘉山軍需 鄭薯는 貪濫罪로 奪印符處斬하고 博川郡守 任聖皐는 以庫錢犯用罪로 奪印符嚴囚 하얏스 니 此檄文을 若有*傳之邑則兵到之日에 該邑首校鄕憲은 斷當軍律施行事라.

2. 傳令
穴者는 知雨하고 巢者는 知風하나니 以人으로 不知天時者는 可謂人乎아. 穴者巢者之下愚也로다. 子名은 非海愚오, 正是下愚也라. 遺剌客陰害하니 井蛙之所跳梁이로다. 而子-欲學公孫子陽乎아 欲遺剌客이면 何不遺同朝之人하고 乃遺小卒하야 如是見洩也오. 帳下之卒도 亦吾關西之民이니 豈有致誠盡心哉아 全大*李仁培 등은 不得已處斬하니 如有陰謀여든 勿遺關西之人하고 且欲堅壁抗命이어든 營內城上에 勿置關西之民하고 卽招自家之妻妾子弟奴婢하야 編伍同心이 可也니라. 子則世祿之臣이오. 外곤之將이라. 廉恥所在에 雖知天命人心이나 不可城下之盟이니 大軍拔城之日에 請遂子大夫之名하리라. 近日에 嘉山 鄭著와 博川郡守 任聖皐와 定州牧使 李近胃와 郭山郡守 李永植과 宣川府使 金益淳과 鐵山府使 李章謙과 龍川府使 權琇와 義州府尹 趙興鎭과 朔州府使 尹敏東은 *然從風하니 此輩-雖知天命人心이나 子大夫之罪人也로다. 假令守城之時에 却關西之人하고 納世祿之臣則固當不解而天人이 共諭하야 世祿之輩도 猶此瓦解하니 何必待甘石而觀天하며 .招巫咸而筮人乎아 願磨細柳營中에 曲眉豊頰之妓는 雖是被中之情이나 此乃關西之産이니 安知非舟中之敵乎며 百祥樓下에 擁紈萬弓之士도 此赤關西之産이니 安知穀下之羌乎아 然則子大夫-有何曾中之甲하야 以兀然獨坐于萬仞之中고 首級之落이 日已久矣로다. 何不自諒也오. 以此知悉하야 欲生則生하고 欲死則死하라. 春秋拔施投衡之敎也-니라.
(이 傳令은 安州兵使 李海愚가 剌客으로 洪을 暗殺하랴다가 發覺된 후 洪이 李에게 送한 것이다.)＜12＞
