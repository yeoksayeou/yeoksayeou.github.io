Song of the Haenyeo  
						Seokbuk Shin Gwang-su  
The daughter of Jeju is skilled at diving, at ten she learned to play in the stream.  

Customary marriages value diving girls, parents boast without worry for clothing or food.  

I, a northerner, have heard and do not believe, sent this year to the southern sea for travel.  

In the eastern city, the winds and sun of February are loud, each family’s children come out from the waters.  

With a shovel, a response, and a ladle, what shame is there in being bare with small pants?  

Directly into the deep blue water without doubt, scattered leaves flutter in the air above.  

The northerner is astonished, while the southerner laughs, hand in hand they play across the current.  

Suddenly, learning from a fledgling, nowhere to escape, only seeing the ladle lightly floating on the water.  

Before long, emerging from the azure waves, they urgently pull back the gourd rope to remain.  

At that moment, a long howl expels breath, its sound moves sorrowfully through the quiet of the water palace.  

In life, what need is there for this as a profession, you alone greedily pursue profit and death.  

Is it not heard that land can be farmed and silkworms raised? Among the dangers of the world, none are as perilous as water.  

The skilled dive deep nearly a hundred feet, often they encounter the hunger of the greedy eel.  

Since service was abolished in the past, officials say they will give money.  

Eighth routes proceed to the capital, days pass with dried fish dried.  

Gold and jade in the abodes of high officials, silk and brocade in the seats of noble sons.  

Do they not know the hardships from which these come?  

Having just gone through a chew, the matter has been pushed aside.  

Though you are happy, I lament.  

Alas, where the lives of people are burdened by my mouth and stomach, sigh, as a scholar from Haizhou, green fish is also hard to eat, only enough to fill the stomach from dawn to dusk.

海女歌
						石北 申光洙
耽羅女兒能善泅, 十歲己學前溪遊.
土俗婚姻重潛女, 父母誇無衣食憂.
我是北人聞不信, 奉使今年南海遊.
城東二月風日喧, 家家兒女出水頭.
一鍬一答一瓢子, 赤身小袴何曾羞.
直下不疑深靑水, 紛紛風葉空中投.
北人駭然南人笑, 挈手相戱橫乘流.
忽學*雛沒無處, 但見瓢子輕輕水上浮.
斯須湧出碧波中, 急引匏繩以腹留.
一時長嘯吐氣息, 其聲悲動水宮幽.
人生爲業何須此, 爾獨貪利絶輕死.
豈不聞陸可農蠶山可採世間極險無如水.
能者深入近百尺, 往往又遭飢蛟食.
自從均役罷日供, 官吏雖云與錢*.
八道進奉走京師, 日幾䭾生乾鰒.
金玉達官庖, 綺羅公子席.
豈知辛苦所從事.
纔經一嚼案已推.
女爾雖樂, 吾自哀.
奈何處人生命累吾口腹, 嗟吾書生海州靑魚, 亦難喫但得朝夕一*足.＜31＞
