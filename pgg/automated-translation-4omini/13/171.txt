The expected "Student Evaluation Records of Each School" that students were looking forward to is regrettably not included as it has been removed by the authorities and cannot be published. <86>  

**Summary**  

This brief article expresses disappointment regarding the removal of the anticipated "Student Evaluation Records of Each School," which was expected to provide insight into student life and evaluation within Korean educational institutions during the colonial period. The note underscores the restrictions faced by publications during this time, reflecting the oppressive oversight of the Japanese authorities in Korea, which often suppressed student voices and autonomy in educational discourse. Historians might find this indicative of the broader efforts to control educational content and the suppression of dissent.
