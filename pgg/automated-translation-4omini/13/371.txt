Three Major Prize Contests

2. Our Company Large Recruitment: Prizes of gold wristwatches (p. 153)  

3. Votes for Joheun Barbershop: Special prizes to be awarded (p. 124)  

 

**Summary**  

This article announces three major contests offered by the magazine, aimed at engaging the readership and promoting various businesses and services. The contests include a financial reward for pest control, promotional items for barbering, and a recruitment initiative with valuable prizes. These competitions reflect the economic conditions and social issues of Korea during the colonial period, highlighting the efforts to stimulate consumer engagement amid difficult circumstances.
