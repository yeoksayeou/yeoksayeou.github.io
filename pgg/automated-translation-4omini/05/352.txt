**Summary**

The article invites submissions for creative songs and traditional folk songs, highlighting an effort to preserve and celebrate Korean culture and its evolving modern identity in 1927. The call for submissions reflects a cultural movement during the colonial period, where Korean artists sought to assert their national identity against Japanese dominance. Historians might find the emphasis on folk traditions and the encouragement of contemporary expressions significant as it underscores the complexities of cultural resilience and adaptation under colonial rule.
