The Eternal-Shirt  
"The Eternal-Shirt" is an indescribable novel that is like a first encounter with tears. In a tragic event that burned down over thirty houses in a single night, a beautiful fact emerged that made the readers weep. It might even be called a piece of scripture...  

Korea's Pride  
Korea's pride! While it is easy to know Korea's disgrace, understanding its pride is difficult. The pride of Korea, what might it be? You must come to identify this.  

Five People, One Mind  
A joint work by Woo Mae-song, Son Jin-tae, Ko Han-seung, and Bang Jeong-hwan, along with five others amounts to a collaborative novel, crafted together by nine people. It is incredibly interesting, with an unparalleled variety of content that no one will be able to stop reading from the very first page. This diverse and delightful article is all included in the March issue of “Children” magazine.  

The March issue of “Children” is a special commemorative issue celebrating the fourth anniversary of the magazine, and in addition to the three pieces introduced above, it contains about fifteen or sixteen famous pieces. There is also a special supplement offering the first beautiful "Three-color Art Photo Book Cover" (which can be suitable for notebooks or diaries, or even hung on walls) with two colors, and also a free distribution of the March issue of the Children's News.  

You may send just fifteen jeon (the cost of a pack of cigarettes), and also postal stamps are acceptable, to the publishing company. What a wonderful thing will you receive!
