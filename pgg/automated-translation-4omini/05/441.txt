With the escalation of the war, Japan's economic system has factored into its strategies and policies, reflecting a militaristic approach that emphasizes resource allocation and production efficiency.

Under the directive of the government, industries have been mobilized to support military efforts, often at the expense of civilian needs. The agricultural sector is undergoing a transformation to prioritize food production for the troops, which in turn leads to shortages for consumers. Rationing and control measures are tightening around essential goods as the government seeks to manage the dwindling supplies effectively. 

Moreover, the financial sector is adapting by increasing interest rates on loans, attempting to encourage savings and investments in war-related industries. This has placed a strain on small businesses and farmers who are unable to keep up. 

Moreover, propagation of propaganda around these economic measures serves to promote unity and sacrifice among the populace. In essence, Japan's wartime economy is characterized by a systemic focus on militarization, with an undertone of societal transformation. However, this has led to disparities and tensions within society as various groups struggle to adapt to the rapid changes imposed upon them.
