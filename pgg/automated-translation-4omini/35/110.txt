Rumor Bulletin

Recently, Namgyeong Jeom, who has been contributing significantly to society as the president of the Gwandong Society and the publisher of the Gwangseong Newspaper, has been dedicating himself to church activities and educational projects in Hongcheon County (Mugok). He is particularly focusing on the cultivation of 무궁화 (Mugunghwa) saplings and plans to distribute about 10,000 of them to schools in Kyungsang this spring.

Due to illness, Roh Jaeyong had long severed his ties with society and has been recuperating at his home in Seongbuk-dong. Recently, he has recovered significantly and is said to be preparing to make a return to the literary world soon. Congratulations are in order for this reason.

On January 7, Jeong Bak and Lee Jeong-yun, after being released from prison, stayed at the Haeseong Hotel in the city. Jeong went to Iron Window (Taejeong) while Lee headed to Chuncheon County. After a long period of hardship in the iron bars, they plan to enjoy a few months of healing before returning to Seoul.

Hwang Sinduk, who experienced great misfortunes after leaving his children in autumn, is reported to be mourning the recent tragic news of his beloved daughter Won-bin's (Won-byeon) unfortunate accident. The affairs of the world bring both joy and sorrow.

Lee Seong-tae, who has been receiving treatment at the medical college hospital for more than a year since his release from prison, recently faced a recurrence of his illness and reportedly underwent another surgery.

Former principal of Pojeong Vocational School, Yoon Ik-seon, has moved to the Deokjeong Station area of the Gyeongwon Line for a prolonged rural lifestyle, having recently arrived in Gyeongseong. Remarkably, what was once a dynamic and formidable person is now showing signs of white hair. <37>  

**Summary**  

The article provides updates on various notable individuals' circumstances and contributions during a challenging time in Korean society. The focus on Namgyeong Jeom's efforts in education and cultivation reflects the social activism prevalent in the 1930s amidst colonial struggles. Additionally, the personal health updates and unfortunate events surrounding figures like Roh Jaeyong and Hwang Sinduk illustrate the emotional and physical toll of the era on many.

Historians may find the emphasis on community involvement and the interplay of personal and public lives significant, as they paint a picture of resilience and complexity within Korean society during colonial rule.
