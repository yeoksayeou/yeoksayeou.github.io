Announcement of Prize Winners of the New Year Issue  
The last New Year issue was extremely popular in various ways, and the number of participants in the prize contest reached a total of 16,876. However, what is quite unsettling is that there were very few correct answers. Starting from this issue, I thought it would be a good idea to make it easier for everyone to submit answers merely by thinking about it. I hope you will continue to participate in the contest. The correct answers are as follows.  
Upon seeing this, many will likely exclaim in surprise and hit their knees. Most of those who were close to the correct answer will feel regret, but unfortunately, they are excluded from winning.  

a. 20 years old  
b. 19 years old  
c. 18 years old  
d. 27 years old

**Summary**  

The article announces the winners of a prize contest held in conjunction with the New Year issue of the magazine, highlighting the surprisingly high participant count but low number of correct answers. This reflects publication trends during the colonial period when magazines served as key sources of entertainment and engagement among readers. Historians might find the high number of participants indicative of both the magazine’s influence and the cultural dynamics of the time, as colonial subjects sought connections and engagement through such contests.
