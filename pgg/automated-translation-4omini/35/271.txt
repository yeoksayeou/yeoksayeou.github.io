◇In this issue, on page 112, you will find a photo of children. They are very adorable babies.  

◇How old were those babies?  

◇Please think carefully and write down the ages starting from the biggest baby in order on the answer sheet ①……②……③…… and send it to our office by the 20th of this month.  

◇Thirty people who guess correctly will receive a special notebook produced by our office, and one of them will be selected by lottery to receive an additional gift.  

Notice  

Those who were selected in last month's prize must urgently provide their address to receive their prize. Some individuals have not provided their address yet.  

  
**Summary**  

This article announces a new prize question regarding the ages of children shown in a photograph. Participants are encouraged to send their answers to the publisher, with 30 winners receiving prizes. The request for previous winners to confirm their addresses emphasizes the communication challenges during the colonial period. Historians might find the community engagement and the promotional strategies used to appeal to the public insightful as they reflect the conditions and societal norms of the time.
