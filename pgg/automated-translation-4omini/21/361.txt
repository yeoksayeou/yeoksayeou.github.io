Article on Magazine Policy

1. Please do not write your address and name carelessly; write them clearly.

(The magazine is often returned.)

2. Please clearly specify the issue number, whether it is a certain month or a specific number.

(If you do not write the month, the magazine may easily get lost.)

3. Please add postal fees instead of neglecting them.

(It is troublesome when we have to request for missing issues via postcard, leading to loss.)

4. Please do not send payment by remittance or postal stamp; if possible, send by bank transfer.

(Sending money through the middle might cause loss, and the transmission fees can be high.)<105>
