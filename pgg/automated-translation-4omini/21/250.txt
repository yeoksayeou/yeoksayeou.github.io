The remaining straw house, which is the only one left in the middle of Chabonggol, is the very center of Seoul, the center of the city, and this region shaped like a tortoise is referred to as "Baegeob" (뱃곱), and hence it is called "Baegeob House". Due to a fire that occurred when the area changed its use, the straw house couldn't be maintained. The police prohibit straw houses, so it is said that in recent years with renewed efforts, a fire happened again, and it was restored to a straw house once more.<74>  

**Summary**  

The article discusses the historical center of Seoul, emphasizing a unique straw house that represents the cultural heritage of the area. It highlights the conflicts between modernization and traditional structures, particularly through the lens of urban development and disaster management, as illustrated by the recurring fires and the police's prohibition of straw houses. Historians may find the portrayal of urban development in Seoul during the colonial period, along with the tension surrounding traditional architecture, particularly relevant in understanding the socio-cultural impacts of colonialism on Korean urban landscapes.
