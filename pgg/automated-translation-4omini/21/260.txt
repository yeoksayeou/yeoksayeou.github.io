京城五大鍾辨正錄  
In Seoul, there originally existed five large bells. The first was cast in the summer of the fourth year of Taejo (1395), and it was placed in the Bell Pavilion of Jongno. This bell, known as the Wonin Bell, was inscribed by Gwongeun of Yang Village, and it was rung at dawn and dusk. The second bell was cast on the 7th day of the 10th month of the 12th year of Taejong (1412), with the inscription by Byeon Cheon-ting Gi-ryang, specifically made to be hung at the Gwanghwamun Gate (the Bell of Taejong's merits). The third bell was cast in the first month of the 3rd year of Sejo (1457), and Shin Suk-joo composed the inscription for this bell, which was placed in front of the Seonjeongjeon Hall in Gyeongbokgung, used for instructing the troops. The fourth bell was cast in the 10th month of the 7th year of Sejo (1461) and the inscription was composed by the officer Han Gi-hui, with the writing by the official Jeong Nan-jong; it was hung in Jeongdong at the Hyeongtel Temple (previously known as a guardian temple of Jeongneung). The fifth bell was also cast in the 2nd month of the 13th year of Sejo (1464), made by King Gwangsan Gun Kim Guk-gwang. However, the first bell, that is the Wonin Bell, was destroyed during the Imjin War when the Bell Pavilion burned, becoming lost. The second bell, that is the Gwanghwamun Gate Bell, also burned during the war when the palace was set on fire, and thus was lost. The third bell was originally inside the palace, but it was moved to an outer pavilion west of Gwanghwamun. In the year of Jeongjeong, the bell returned to be hung inside the palace, but later the pavilion burned, and the bell survived. It was not long before it broke and ceased to ring; thus, it was referred to as the "Mute Bell." In the 3rd year of King Lee Tae-wang (1926), during the time of making 100 coins, it was melted down; therefore, the saying "put the Wonin Bell in your pocket" came to be considered a prophetic saying during that time. The fourth bell, the Jeongneung Bell, after the Hyeongtel Temple became abandoned, was moved to the Wonjeong Temple (now the site of Tower Park), but after the 7th year of Jungjong, the Wonjeong Temple was again abandoned. At that time, the powerful minister Kim An-ro moved it to Dongdaemun, intending to ring it at dawn and dusk, yet shortly thereafter An-ro faced failure, and it remained at Dongdaemun for more than 350 years until, in May of the 24th year of King Yeongjong, the king instructed, "Tell the officials of the department to set up pavilions for the two bells at Heunginmun and outside Gwanghwamun, which have inscriptions of Gwangmyeong (Sejo) and the honorary titles of the inner hall, along with previously written ones." Thus, that pavilion was established and the bell was placed there. Recently, in the 3rd year of King Lee Tae-wang (1926), during the reconstruction of Gwanghwamun, it was commanded that the monks of each temple transport the Dongdaemun Bell and hang it at the gate tower, holding a ceremony to celebrate the completion of the gate, and on April 28th of the 4th year of Yongheung, it was transferred to the Lee Wang Museum. Lastly, the fifth bell currently resides in the Botaek Pavilion, and this bell is noted as a brother bell to the aforementioned museum bell in terms of being an ancient relic of Seoul. However, the origin of this bell is recorded in the "Joseo Yeonghwa," where it mentions, "In the 13th year of the 5th cycle (1478), a large bell was cast and placed on Unjong Street, ringing at dawn and dusk." It is unclear how this bell later came to Botaek, and no bell inscriptions or other records exist; indeed, this bell's surface has become worn, and the name of the casting official is only recorded in the 54 lines following the casting of the 2nd month of the 4th year of Seonghwa (1464), making it difficult to ascertain its lineage. However, it is certain that the casting occurred in the 4th year of Seonghwa, which distinguishes it from the previously mentioned bells. Lately, various records announced by both domestic and foreign individuals tend to mistakenly identify this bell as the Jeongneung Bell, thus readers should particularly remain mindful. 

However, currently the Botaek Pavilion was burned due to a great fire on October 28th of the 6th year of King Lee Tae-wang (1936), and it was reconstructed on the same day. The upper beam inscription was written by Jeong Gi-seo, and the calligraphy was by Lee Ban Kim Da-jin; the three characters of Botaek Pavilion were recently inscribed on March 15th of the 32nd year of King Lee Tae-wang by Kim Gyu-jin of Haegang.

**Summary**

This article details the history of the five major bells in Seoul, highlighting the cultural significance and historical events surrounding their casting, destruction, and subsequent relocations over several centuries. The narrative particularly reflects on the dynamics of power and cultural continuity, as the bell's stories intertwine with key historical events like the Imjin War and changing governance in Joseon. Historians may find this account revealing for its insights into the socio-political context of Korea during Japanese colonial rule, reflecting on how such cultural artifacts were perceived and transformed over time amidst turmoil.

京城五大鍾辨正錄
						靑吾
서울에는 원래에 큰 鐘이 5개가 잇섯스니 第一은 최초 太祖4년 乙亥 녀름에 鑄造하야 鍾路 鐘閣에 置하고 晨昏에 치던 것이니 이것이 元 인경이라 하는 鐘으로써 陽村 權近이 銘을 지엿고 第二는 太宗12년 10월初7일에 鑄造하야 卞春亭季良이 銘을 지은 것이니, 光化門樓에 달기 위하야 鑄造한 것이오(太宗의 功德頌鐘) 第三은 世祖3년 정월에 鑄造하야 申叔舟가 銘을 作한 것이니 景福內 思政殿前 廡에 置하고 禁軍을 호령하던 것이오 第四는 世祖7년 壬午10월(天順6년 壬午10월(鐘銘云)-)에 鑄造하야 吏叅 韓繼禧가 鐘銘을 撰하고 吏郞 鄭蘭宗이 書하얏스니 貞洞 興天寺(舊 貞陵守護寺)에 懸하엿던 것이오 第五는 世祖13년 2월(成化4년 2월)에 鑄造하얏스니 都提造는 光山君 金國光이다. 그런데 第一鐘 즉 元인경은 壬辰亂 때에 鐘閣이 燒火되며 타서 록아 업서젓고 第二鐘은 즉 光化門樓鐘도 壬亂時 궁궐이 燒火될 때에 역시 타서 업서젓스며 第三鐘은 원래 宮中에 잇다가 光化門外 西便에 閣을 짓고 移懸하얏더니 睿宗원년에 宮城內로 다시 移懸하얏다가 壬亂에 閣만 燒火되고 鐘은 殘存하엿더니 英宗24년에 更히 閣을 建하얏더니 後에 鐘이 破하야 소리가 나지 안음으로 민간에서 謂之 벙어리종이라 하더니 李太王3년 丙寅에 當百錢 제조할 때에 녹여 썻스니 속담에 『인경을 떼여 주머니에 늘 놈』이란 말이 이 때에 한 讖言이 된 것이다. 그리고 第四鐘 즉 貞陵鐘은 興天寺가 廢한 뒤에 圓覺寺(今 塔洞公園址)에 移懸하얏다가 中宗7년에 圓覺寺가 又廢하니 당시 權臣 金安老가 東大門에 移置하야 晨昏에 鳴코자 하다가 未幾에 安老가 失敗하야 여의치 못하고 爾來 350여 년을 東大門側에 잇다가 英宗24년 5월에 上이 『地部의 臣에게 謂하야 曰 興仁門內와 光化門外에 各히 一鐘이 잇는데 鐘面에 光廟(世祖)와 內殿의 徽號가 잇고 또 御製가 잇스니 다 閣을 設하고 貯하라.』 命함으로 그 閣을 設하고 置하엿다가 최근 李太王3년 丙寅 光化門 重建時에 各寺 승려를 命하야 東大門鐘을 運搬하야 門樓에 달고 法會를 設하며 門의 落成을 祝하엿더니 隆熙4년 4월28일에 李王職博物館에 移藏하얏다. 그리고 第五鐘은 現今 普信閣에 잇는 것이니 上記 博物館鐘과 가티 京城의 古物로 兄弟鐘으로 著名한 것이다. 그런데 此鐘의 出處는 다만 『朝野會通』 世祖紀에 戊午13년에 大鐘을 鑄하야 雲從街에 置하고 晨昏을 驚하얏다 云하고 엇던 경로로 지금 普信閣으로 왓다는 말이나 그 鐘銘 또는 다른 기록이 업스며 실제에 이 鐘도 표면이 모도 消融되고 다만 成化4년 2월(世祖13년) 이하 54行에 당시 監鑄者의 氏名만 記하얏슴으로 그 내력을 잘 알수 업다.(氏名도 消落이 만타) 그러나 成化4년 즉 世祖13년에 鑄造란 것만은 확실한 즉 上記 諸鐘과는 혼동할 수 업는 것이다. 그런데 근래 內外人의 발표한 여러 기록을 보면 대개는 本鐘을 貞陵鐘으로 誤認하니 독자는 특히 留意할 것이다.

然而 현재 普信閣은 李太王6년 己巳에 10월28일에 큰 화재가 잇서 燒火된 후 그해 10월28일에 重建한 것이니 그 上樑文은 鄭基世가 撰하고 書는 禮判 金大振의 筆이오 普信閣 3字는 최근 李太王32년 3월15일에 揭하얏스니 海崗 金圭鎭의 筆이다.<75>
