Next issue will be the Third Anniversary Special Issue  

The next issue of this magazine will be a special edition celebrating the third anniversary of our publication. With our constant new editing, which has made us a leader in this field, we will add an extra layer of sophistication among special features that the readers should expect in advance. As for articles, they will of course be included, but we will also embellish the special issue with the cover and illustrations, along with supplementary pages that will decorate the commemorative issue in various ways. We will print an increased number of copies in advance, so I urge readers to subscribe early to avoid disappointment from not being able to obtain a copy.  

Ceremony and Discussion to be Published in Next Issue  

The wedding ceremony that we had planned to feature in this issue is being postponed to the next issue, as this edition is solely focused on articles pertaining to Kyŏngsŏng (Kyoto) and has limited pages. Although we are not pleased with this delay, we ask that you please look forward to the next issue. <171>  

**Summary**  

This editorial note announces that the next issue of the magazine will celebrate its third anniversary with special features, articles, and additional content to attract readership. The anticipation of readers is emphasized, particularly relating to a wedding ceremony that will now debut in the anniversary issue instead of the current one. This indicates a strategy to engage the audience and maintain interest in a colonial context where such publications often straddled local culture and broader societal trends, including the significance of marriage ceremonies within Korean society under Japanese rule.
