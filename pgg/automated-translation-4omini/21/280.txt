The Open River (開川) of Gyeongseong (京城) had until then been subjected to floods due to the Jun River (濬川) overflowing every year, causing unwarranted hardships to the city's inhabitants for over 300 years since its establishment. In the 39th year of King Yeongjo's (英祖) reign, in March of the year Gyeongja (庚辰), the management of the Jun River began, and it was completed in April of the same year. However, lacking stone constructions on either side and only planting willows, it collapsed every year, requiring considerable national expenditure for repairs. In the 49th year of King Yeongjo's reign, in the year Gyesi (癸巳), the defense official Lee Kyungyu (李景祐) of Yongin (龍仁) petitioned to designate areas for the military gates and commenced stone construction, marking the inception of the stone construction at Gyeongseong's Open River.

  
**Summary**

The article discusses the significant flooding issues faced by Gyeongseong due to the Jun River over a period of 300 years and the steps taken to address these challenges, culminating in the first instance of stone construction along the river initiated by Lee Kyungyu. This event reflects the historical struggle against natural disasters, providing insight into the administrative responses and infrastructure developments during the colonial period. Historians might find the bureaucratic and military undertones of the river management particularly revealing, illustrating how local governance and modernization efforts were influenced by larger colonial dynamics.

京城 開川石築의 始
京城의 開川은 設都 후 300여 년이 되도록 濬川을 안이하야 매년 潦霖의 時에는 洪水가 汎濫하야 都內 人民이 不虞의 患을 免치 못하던 바 英祖39년  庚辰3월에 비로소 濬川의 役을 始하야 同4월에 完了하얏다. 그러나 左右에 石築이 업고 但히 柳를 種하얏슴으로 매년 崩潰하야 此를 修補하기에 國費가 不少하더니 英祖49년 癸巳(距今 157년 전)에 守禦使 李景祐氏(龍仁人)가 上奏하야 諸軍門으로 구역을 정하야 石築을 하니 此가 京城 開川石築의 嚆矢다.<81>
