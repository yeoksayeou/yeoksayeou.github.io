Two Hundred and Nine  
Mr. Saengri (生理先生) said, "In the human body, there are approximately two hundred bones."  
The student responded, "Sir, I have two hundred and nine."  
Mr. Saengri exclaimed, "What?!"  
The student explained, "I swallowed a fishbone during lunch today." <78>  

**Summary**  

This lighthearted article uses a humorous exchange between a teacher and a student to playfully illustrate misconceptions about anatomy. The punchline reveals the absurdity of the student's claim, highlighting the everyday experiences of children. This reflection of educational dynamics and humor provides insight into the broader attitudes toward education during the Japanese colonial period, where a blend of humor and learning characterized students' relationships with teachers. Historians may find this exchange representative of the cultural influences and social interactions of the time.
