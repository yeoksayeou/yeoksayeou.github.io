Flower Time Tune  
In the flower chapter,  
The peony is the king of flowers,  
The sunflower is a loyal minister,  
The chrysanthemum is the recluse,  
And the plum blossom is the cold scholar.  
The gourd flower is the old man,  
And the dianthus is the youth.  
The apricot flower is the shaman,  
And the crabapple is the prostitute.  
Among them, the red peach, the blue peach,  
And the three-colored peach blossom are the gallant youths.  

Spring Night  
Spring night is bitterly short,  
As it passes into the day,  
I open the bamboo window,  
And hear the winds and rains of the night,  
And wonder how many flowers have fallen.  
Oh, child, do not be sad,  
For the fallen flowers do not matter.  

Peach Blossom River Water  
The headwater flows on both riverbanks,  
Now I see the peach blossoms  
Scattered on the clear waters,  
With the shadows of the mountains  
Snoozing in the depths.  
Oh, maiden, shall I be in Wuling?  
Where am I now?  

Bees  
Oh, bees flying above  
In a small courtyard full of flowers,  
Do not touch every flower,  
While the tricky spider in the evening sun  
Has laid its web and is watching.  

**Summary**

花時調
花編
모란은 花中王이오 向日花는 忠臣이라 菊花는 隱逸士요 梅花寒士로다 박(匏花)은 老人이오 石竹花는 少年이라 杏花巫堂이요 海棠은 娼妓로다 그中에 紅桃, 碧桃, 三色桃花는 風流郞인가하노라.
春宵
春宵가 苦短키로 日商에이러나서 竹窓을열고보니 夜來風雨聲에 花落知多少라. 童子야쓸늘마라 落花ㄴ들아니랴.
桃花流水
頭流山兩端水를 녯듯고이제보니 桃花맑은물에 山影좃차잠겻세라 아희야 武陵이되메냐 나는엔가하노라.
