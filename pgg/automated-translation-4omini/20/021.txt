Prize for White Rice  
This issue includes a contest where readers who vote on the article regarding the competition between the South and North Troops will receive one bag of premium white rice. Please refer to page 105 <5>  

**Summary**  

The article announces a contest encouraging readers to vote on an article related to the rivalry between the South and North Troops, with the incentive of winning a bag of premium white rice. This reflects the socio-economic conditions of the time, where staple food such as rice held significant value amidst colonial struggles. Historians might find the use of such contests to engage the public in colonial discourse particularly revealing of the ways in which colonial authorities sought to influence public opinion and promote nationalism, as rice was not just a food item but also a symbol of stability and identity.
