京義線京釜線 南北隊競爭探訪記事  
As announced in the previous issue, on the morning of June 29, the reporters from the North and South teams began an urgent exploration over a distance of a thousand ri (approximately 400 kilometers) and collected various unique articles from ten cities over a span of five days. 

The more than forty pages published herein are the result, which allowed just a mere "daily manuscript of twenty pages." Considering the limited time permitted for article submission, which was only about ten hours while traveling by automobile, it was a challenge to seek out events in places they were visiting for the first time, with the readers bearing witness to this effort.

Exciting Announcement  
After reading the articles published in this book, if you vote for "which team performed better," the number of votes will be considered for that team. Among those who vote for that team, we will hold a drawing and award "a bag of high-quality white rice" to one lucky winner, and a total of ninety-nine other participants will receive lovely prizes. 

* The ballot must be filled out on the paper available at the end of this page (please cut it out).  
* The deadline for submissions is until August 31 (please write your address and name clearly).  
The results of the prize finding from the previous issue will be announced in the next issue.

**Summary**  

This article describes the collaborative efforts of North and South Korean journalists traveling together to document and compare their experiences across ten cities along the Gyeongui and Gyeongbu Railways. The competition not only showcases the dynamics between North and South Korea but also illustrates the significance of transportation in shaping the cultural narratives during the colonial period. Historians might find the emphasis on regional distinctions and the communal experiences of the journalists particularly relevant for understanding the socio-political context of Korea in the late 1920s.
