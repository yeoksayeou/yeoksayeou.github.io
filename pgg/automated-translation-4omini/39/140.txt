近代人物畵報  
Jeon Byeongjun was from Gofu, Jeollabuk-do. 37 years ago, in the second month of the Gyeongmu year (甲午), at the age of 41 (born in Gyeongin), he led the forefront of the Korean popular movement by inciting the Donghak (now Cheondogyo) Rebellion. Within just a few months, he almost occupied the Jeolla and Chungcheong provinces, but unfortunately suffered a great defeat at Gongju against the combined forces of the Japanese and the Korean government. He fled as a scattered soldier to Jeonbuk, Sunchang, only to be captured by the government soldiers in December of that year and was executed in Kyongsong Prison the following February. This photograph was taken by a Japanese named Ten’yūkyaku among those who accompanied him when he was captured by the government forces and it is a rare image, a precious photograph preserved by our editor Cha Sangchan. This is the first publication of Mr. Jeon's photograph in Korea (in the center is Jeon, dressed in a topknot).

  

**Summary**  

The article presents a brief biography of Jeon Byeongjun, a significant figure in the Donghak Rebellion, highlighting his role in the early 1900s Korean resistance against colonial rule. His rapid rise and equally swift fall emphasizes the struggles of the Korean populace during this turbulent period. Historians may find Jeon's story particularly revealing as it encapsulates the fervent resistance to oppression and the tragedy of national fragmentation faced under colonial dominance.
