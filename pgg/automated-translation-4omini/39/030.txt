Modern Portrait Photo Report  
Mr. Lee Yong-ik (李容翊) was born in Gyeongsangbuk-do (咸北吉州) and was a prominent figure in the pro-Russian faction during the late Joseon Dynasty. He held high offices such as Minister of Military Affairs and Director of the Internal Revenue Office, and he dedicated himself to education by establishing schools such as Busung Professional Middle School and elementary schools. After the Russo-Japanese War, the pro-Japanese faction led by Song Byeong-ki gained political power, leading to the decline of the pro-Russian faction, and he wandered in Shanghai under Russian rule until he ultimately passed away in Haicheng Wei. He is the main character in the event known as the so-called First Bank and the 900,000 won incident, as reported in the newspapers. Mr. Lee Jong-ho (李鍾浩), who is his adopted son, is associated with this incident.

  
**Summary**  

The article outlines the life of Lee Yong-ik, a notable pro-Russian politician and educator during the late Joseon period who faced the decline of his faction after the Russo-Japanese War. The mention of events related to his life, particularly the First Bank and the 900,000 won incident, highlights the complex dynamics of colonial politics and the shifting allegiances during this tumultuous period in Korean history. Historians may find the transformation of political factions in early 20th-century Korea and its impact on education and governance particularly interesting.
