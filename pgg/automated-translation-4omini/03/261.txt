**Summary**  

This article invites students to submit humorous and satirical cartoons, aiming to engage the youth in creative expression. The call for participation reflects a cultural promotion of artistic endeavors among students during a time when Korea was under Japanese colonial rule, suggesting a subtle push against oppressive constraints through humor and satire. Historians might find interest in how such platforms created spaces for youth engagement and dissent during the colonial period.
