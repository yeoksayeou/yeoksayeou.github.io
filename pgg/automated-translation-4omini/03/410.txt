What a strange world this is, to think this is something to be proud of...  

  

**Summary**  

This article reflects on the absurdities of contemporary society, suggesting a disconnect between what is considered worthy of pride and the true state of affairs. The emphasis on recognition and awards in the arts might be interpreted as a critique of societal values in colonial Korea, where cultural expressions were often measured against imperial standards. Historians might find interest in how such a narrative illustrates the tension between local identity and colonial influences on cultural production.
