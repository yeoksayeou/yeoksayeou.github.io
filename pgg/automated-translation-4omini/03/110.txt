Article Type: 잡저 (Essays)  

In a certain rural village in Switzerland, a place called “Wife Brothel” has emerged. When a young woman in the village wanted to open a bar, the wives of the households opposed it, saying, “This is a serious issue,” and they conducted a campaign against it to prevent its establishment. Instead, they decided to open the bar collectively among themselves and take turns managing it, consuming alcohol together. 

It is currently a significant topic of interest in Europe whether this wife bar will thrive or not...

**Summary**  

The article discusses an unusual case in a Swiss village where local wives banded together to open a bar, resisting an individual woman’s attempt to run one on her own. This collective approach reflects broader themes of community, gender roles, and economic adaptation during a time of societal change. Historians might find the article interesting for its glimpse into women's agency and the negotiation of social norms, particularly during the period of heightened gender awareness in the early 20th century that coincided with the larger European context of economic and social upheaval.
