A More Grand February Issue  

The ongoing Modern Rare Occupation Exhibition, which has received immense popularity and praise, is not merely a collection of interesting articles or world treasures. We believe it serves a greater purpose. In the February issue, we will present even more extraordinary professions that were not featured in the previous issue. Expect great treasures greater than those in the January issue!

The Great Beast 'Silver Fly' Rises  

Amidst the era of 'New Women', the great beast, the famous detective 'Silver Fly', has shocked the world with painful satire and secret tailing! Unable to resist the flood of readers' requests, this magazine has compelled his appearance. The return of Silver Fly! February issue!  

Disguised Reporter Second Round Grand Investigation  

The second round of disguised reporters consist of both men and women... Although the publication date is a well-kept secret, we anticipate that the experiences gained from the first round will lead to even more intense and vigorous activities that will astonish the world.

A Great Assembly of Notable Men and Women from Gyeongseong  

In Gyeongseong, there are notable figures, both male and female, who are famous for various traits! Those who are tall are notable, those who are short are notable, those who are unkempt are notable, those who are neat are notable, those who cannot marry are notable, those who marry well are notable - there are countless notable individuals whose names can be recognized by anyone. They will all gather in the February issue for an unprecedented grand spectacle.

The Competition of Exploration Reporters from North and South Teams  

Proudly, "Byeolgeun-gon" has numerous notable reporters. We will divide these reporters into humorous North and South Teams to compete. Whether climbing mountains in the snow or venturing into secret caves at night, they will each write exploratory articles, and readers will judge whose report is superior via a voting system. What a grand and thrilling beginning to the new year! Who will be the reporters? Which team is for the South, and which for the North? Stay tuned for the February issue.

Window Display Contest for Shops  

The featured contest in this issue will undoubtedly provide significant references for our business owners. In the February issue, we will evaluate the display styles of window decorations, scheduled between January 5 and 10... Stay tuned.

To be the first to read the volume, order it in advance! 

**Summary**  

The article announces exciting features for the upcoming February issue of the magazine "Byeolgeun-gon," including a continuation of the Rare Occupation Exhibition, a story featuring the detective Silver Fly, and various competitive explorations by disguised reporters. This enthusiastic presentation reflects the vibrant cultural scene of the 1920s in Korea, with an emphasis on new roles for women and the interplay of North and South teams. Historians studying this era might find the focus on "New Women" and modern professions indicative of changing societal norms during the colonial period.
