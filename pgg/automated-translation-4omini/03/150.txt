Feeling at the Year’s Beginning  
						Choi Myung-hwan, Poseong High School  
1. In all matters, realizing that our efforts are insufficient should serve as a determination to strive even harder.  

2. It is my hope that criticism and reporting be conducted more strictly and accurately, to reflect the authoritative public opinion of the general populace.  

3. This is something I have expressed before at some point, but the present situation regarding women's luxury and the loosening of manners among female students is indeed a significant issue. Compared to the current economic situation in Korea, the luxury of women has grown excessively, and there are not a few instances where male students abandon female students, and likewise, where female students boldly discard male students. Is this something that should be considered by the authorities of women's educational institutions?

年頭感
						普成高普校 崔鳴煥
一, 모든 일에 우리의 努力이 不足한 것을 깁히 께달어 압흐로 一層 더 奮勵할 것은 自己에 대한 決心
二, 評論과 報道를 더 嚴正하게, 더 確實하게 하야 일반 民衆의 權威잇는 여론이 되도록 하엿스면 하는 것은 言論界에 잇는 분에게 대한 希望
三, 이것은 언제인가도 한 번 意見을 말한 바이지만 現下에 잇서서 女子의 奢侈와 女學生의 風紀 갓흔 것도 실로 중대한 문제인가 함니다. 近日의 朝鮮經濟와 對照하여 女子들의 奢侈는 너무나 過分하고 男學生이 女學生을 버려놋는 일도 만치만 女學生 편에서 大膽하게 男學生을 버려 놋는 일도 적지 안슴니다. 그런 것은 女學校 當局者로서도 한 번 考慮할 일인가 함니다.
