Year-End Reflections  
						普成高普校 黃義敦  
Today, we find ourselves contemplating what is essential and what is not, but ultimately, the most significant issue remains what sustains our living: food. So, amidst the ruin of today, without food, how shall we survive?  

First, we must not abandon all dignity and form in our clothing, food, and housing—the essence of life—and must confront the reality with the most genuine attitude if we are to compete with others in life’s values. To put it simply, it would be better for someone struggling to survive to roll up their sleeves and go out to sell bean sprouts than to remain idle at home.

**Summary**  

The article discusses the pressing issue of sustenance during difficult times, emphasizing the importance of taking practical steps toward survival rather than succumbing to despair. The author advocates for a proactive approach, suggesting that individuals should engage in any viable economic activity to ensure their basic needs are met. This reflection could be viewed against the backdrop of Korea's colonial history, as it highlights the struggles of Korean citizens under Japanese rule and their resilience in facing economic hardships. Historians may find it particularly revealing for its practical perspective on survival amidst systemic oppression.

年頭感
						普成高普校 黃義敦
우리는 오늘 안저서 무엇이니 무엇이니 하여도 結局은 먹고 살 것이 무엇보다도 重大한 問題임니다. 그러면 우리는 먹을 것이 업서 破滅하여 버린 오늘에 잇서서 엇지 살 것인가?
첫재 衣食住나 모든 生活에 體面과 形式을 모조리 打破하며 도라보지 말고 가장 眞擊한 態度로 赤裸裸하게 나서서 남과 가치 生活을 競爭하지 안이하면 안될 것이니 가장 卑近하게 말하면 살기 어려운 사람이 손을 싹싹 뷔비고 안저서 굼는 이 보다는 버서붓치고 나서서 콩나물 장사라도 하는 것이 낫겟지오.
