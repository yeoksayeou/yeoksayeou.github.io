民謠자랑-無窮花禮讚  

The folk songs of our land remain as poignant reminders of our rich cultural heritage. They speak to the human condition, encapsulating joys, sorrows, life, and death. Among these, the song that praises the Mu-gong-hwa (無窮花), or "Everlasting Flower," stands out, symbolizing resilience and beauty amidst adversity.

Each verse reflects a deep connection to nature, illustrating how the Mu-gong-hwa blooms even in harsh conditions. This flower has become a metaphor for endurance, representing the spirit of the people during difficult times. The rhythmic patterns in the lyrics evoke a sense of nostalgia, drawing listeners into the emotional landscapes of their ancestors.

As we celebrate this flower, we are not merely honoring its beauty but also the stories it carries—stories of resilience and hope that have been passed down through generations. The folk songs serve as an essential means of preserving these narratives, providing a sense of identity and belonging to the people.

Furthermore, this tribute to the Mu-gong-hwa reflects the ongoing struggle against colonial forces striving to erase our cultural identity. In the face of such adversity, these songs become acts of defiance, asserting the importance of our cultural memory in the modern world.
