A student who had just come to Seoul to study went back to his rural home after a long time. He wore a suit jacket that was cut so short it exposed his waist, with the back neck and upper back torn, and his trousers (chŏbong) were so long that they almost trailed on the ground like a naval uniform. His hat was flattened. Upon seeing this, his father exclaimed,  
"Hey—what on earth is that? You look just like one of those clown performers."  

After some time, just as he was about to go out and put on his shoes, one of his father’s friends arrived.  
His father’s friend said, "Oh, you're all dressed up. I haven't seen you in a while, and Seoul must have changed a lot. Back when your father was in school, he probably wore a long coat and trousers that came down to his calves, but now you've turned into something quite different."  
Father: "I too followed the trends when I was a student."  
Son: "Father, you also dressed like that in your youth." <203>  

Fishing  
“Are you going fishing? Have you caught anything today?”  
“They say it’s so big it could weigh two jun (roughly 6-7 pounds).”  
“Hmm, it sounds like a disaster. Is it a sea bream? An eel?” The one who was fishing hesitated to reply, murmuring,  
“Wow—my friend, what you're saying is all too optimistic. If we caught even one, we'd be lucky.” <203>  

Failure  
Owner: “Hey, Sido! Take this to Kim Seobang and come back quickly. It’s urgent, so hurry up!”  
Sido ran out but ultimately did not return. After waiting and waiting, the frustrated owner saw Sido coming back home just as the sun was setting. Angrily, he scolded Sido,  
"You said it was urgent, and here you are now. Why did it take you so long?"  
Sido lowered his head, replying,  
"I only heard that it was urgent." <203>  

**Summary**  

This article presents a humorous reflection on the changing fashion among students, showcasing the generational divide between the father and son through their clothing choices. The father initially scolds the son for his attire, likening it to a clown’s, which signals a transformation in social norms. This article captures a moment in the colonial period illustrating how Western influences began altering traditional Korean dress and lifestyle, marking a significant cultural shift that historians find interesting as it reflects broader issues of identity and modernization under Japanese rule.

처음으로 서울 와서 공부하든 엇던 학생이 오래간만에 시골집에를 내려갓슴니다. 양복 웃저고리는 허리가 드러나도록 짤게 해 입고 목덜미까지 뒷잔등은 째고 아렛바지(쯔봉)는 발뒷측을 뒤덥허 밟힐 듯이 길고 해군복처럼 통개가 널닷케 닙고 모표는 납짝하게 쪼그렷슴니다. 이 꼴을 본 아버지
「애- 그게 무슨 꼴이냐. 꼭 광대 색기들 갓고나」하고 대책을 햐얏슴니다. 한참 잇다가 어듸를 나가려고 신을 신는 즘에 막 아바지의 친구가 차저왓슴니다.
아바지의 친구 「어-훌늉해젓구만. 그 동안 서울이 퍽 변햇는 걸 자네 아버님 학교 다닐 적에는 모잘랑 잿처 쓰고 아렛바지는 정강이까지 치고 웃저고린 엉덩이 밋까지 왓섯는데 딴판으로 달나젓꾼.」
父  「나도 학생 때엔 류행에 껄녀서 그랫는 걸」
아들  「아버님도 한창은 그리하엿다구요」 ＜203＞

낙시에 걸닌 것
「낙시질 간다드니 인제 오나. 오늘은 무엇이 걸녓서?」
「굉장하에 쭉페면 두자는 넘을 것일세」
「응 수난 폭이 되엿네 그려. 무언가? 도미? 뱀장어?」디립다 뭇는 바람에 낙시ㅅ대 맨 녀석도 머뭇머뭇하면서
「흥ㅇ-, 여보게 말말게 집석일세(집신) 올올이 풀면 두자만 되겟나」203＞

失敗
주인 「얘- 씨동아. 건넌말 김서방한테 이거 좀 갓다주고 오너라. 급하니 빨니 갓다 주고 오너라. 빨니」
씨동이는 곳 뛰여 갓스나 종시 오지 안슴니다. 기다리다 기다리다 못해하든 주인은 해가 다저서야 도라온 씨동이를 보고 잔뜩 화가 나서
「이놈아. 급하다고 햇더니 인제야 와. 무슨 일로 인제야 오니. 안된 자식 갓흐니」
씨동이는 고개를 숙이면서
「빨니가라는 소리만 들엇지요」＜203＞
＜203-203＞
