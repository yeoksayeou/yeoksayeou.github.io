Reflections on the Salsu River  
I-gye Hong Ryungho  

The Sui armies numbered over a million, turning the sands into insects,  
The Qing and Salsu have risen with white waves for a thousand years.  
The rise and fall of previous dynasties is as empty as water and moon,  
The achievements of Eulji Mundeok fill the mountains and rivers.  

The Hua-Yi distinction still recognizes the Three Han,  
The state and the people must surely have many heroes.  
I alone lament the past when the Southern General was upon us,  
Though men may die, only the Yang River remains.  

Celebrating the Retreat of the Japanese Invaders  
Mug-in Lee Seok  

The whale waves spread a thousand miles, shaking the majesty,  
With snow-whitened hair and frost on my cheeks by the river.  
I rejoice more with a peaceful nation in one morning,  
The great mountains owe much to the great mountains. <101>  

**Summary**  

This poem expresses a strong sense of national pride and reflection on Korea’s turbulent history, particularly through the imagery of nature intertwined with historical achievements. The poem evokes a lament for lost heroes like Eulji Mundeok and emphasizes the importance of unity in national identity. For historians of Korean colonial history, this piece is particularly interesting as it encapsulates the desire for resilience and remembrance in the face of oppression, reflecting the sentiments of many Koreans during the 1920s under Japanese rule.
