The sightseers in Seoul will surely want to visit the Tapsadong Park, and those visiting the park cannot miss the Won Gyeok Temple Stele (commonly known as the Turtle Stele) and the Marble Stupa within it. This Won Gyeok Temple Stele is made of marble, reaching a height of 11 feet and 5 inches including the dragon head, and a width of 4 feet and 5 inches. The surface of the dragon head features the stele inscription saying "Dae Won Gyeong Temple Stele" written in seal script—authored by the renowned calligrapher Kang Hee-myeong during the reign of King Sejong. The front side of the stele bears an inscription from the era of King Sejo, written by the scholar Kim Soo-won, who was also famous as a calligrapher during King Sejong’s time. The inscription on the rear was composed by Seo Gujeong, with the characters penned by Jeong Ran-jong. The extraordinary carvings of the dragon head and turtle base, coupled with the two outstanding inscriptions and three famous calligraphers’ works, render this stele a precious artifact known as one of Korea's six exceptional steles.

Over the course of a hundred years, the stele has endured the ravages of wind and rain, causing much of its lettering to erode away; thus, aside from the stele's inscription, it is difficult to discern the rest. However, reference to older records can illuminate its history well (for example, the Seokdong Literary Collection). The temple, Won Gyeok Temple, originally known as Heungbok Temple during the Goryeo Dynasty, was reconstructed and renamed during the reign of King Sejo, derived from the text of the Won Gyeok Sutra. The temple's history can be gleaned from the following inscription:

“In the 10th year of King Sejo, in April (summer), Prince Hyun-nyeong erected a stone bell at Donggang of the Pine Hermitage (Hyoam Temple in Yangju County) and placed the relics of Shakyamuni Buddha, holding a Dharma meeting to lecture on the Won Gyeok Sutra. That evening, the Buddha manifested in the heavens, and auspicious light spread everywhere; the relics, about 800 pieces, were divided. On May 6th, Prince Hyun-nyeong presented the miraculous evidence and the relics to the King. The King and Queen together performed the rite of worship in the Sangwon Hall, and all officials submitted congratulations, leading to a great amnesty in the nation. Consequently, the old site of Heungbok Temple was reconstructed and renamed Won Gyeok Temple, with a circumference of 2,000 paces.

Heungbok Temple was established as the main temple of the Jogye Order when King Taejo fixed the capital to Hanyang (Seoul), but it was abandoned as the order was dissolved and turned into a public office. Nevertheless, on the 6th day of June in the 10th year of King Sejo, the King personally visited and said, 'Baekak Mountain (North) is a protector, and Moksu Mountain (South) is a provider. Positioned to the south with a clear expanse, it is appropriate to construct a grand temple here.' He then commanded Prince Hyun-nyeong to supervise it. They began with a temporary building at the southwestern corner and started constructing the Buddha hall. Suddenly, yellow clouds enveloped the roof, and auspicious signs of flowers fell from the sky; when Prince Hyun-nyeong informed the King, the King visited the Geunjeong Palace to receive officials' congratulations and granted amnesty while rewarding officials with promotions. The completion ceremony was held on the 8th of April the following year. The main hall was named the Great Bright Hall, with the left as the meditation room and the right as the gathering place, naming the outer gate the 'Gate of Rest' and the inner gate the 'Gate of Wisdom.' Within, there is the Hwaeum Hall for preaching and a facility for offerings, referred to as the Seongtaek Hall, and in the east, a pond was dug to plant lotuses while a garden was established in the west for flowers and plants. Behind the main hall, there is a place for storing scriptures, named the Haejang Hall. Moreover, a stupa was built with 13 tiers to house the bodily relics and new Translations of the Won Gyeok Sutra, and its grandeur and artistic beauty are remarkable.

The following year, on April 8, all monks from various mountains were summoned to hold a ceremonial meeting, and the new Won Gyeok Sutra was preached, while the following April 8 the stupa was completed. The King again visited personally, and monks and laypeople who came to venerate were counted in the millions. Afterward, as they returned to the palace, they sang songs in praise, and the city's men and women danced joyously.”

From this, we see that construction of the temple began in June of the 10th year of King Sejo and was completed in October of the same year, with a consecration ceremony on April 8 of the following year. (The Annals of Sejo states, “On April 7th of the 11th year of King Sejo, the Won Gyeok Temple was completed, and a grand celebration ceremony was held for 128 monks to attend the meeting while receiving the official precepts as prescribed.” Another point about the inscription is that it states it was erected on the 4th of April, during the 7th year of the Chenghua reign, which corresponds to the 2nd year of the reign of King Sejong, noted in the Western calendar as 1471, making it 456 years ago. Originally, this stele was planned to be erected at the same time as the temple’s establishment, and King Sejo commissioned the scholar Kim Soo-won to write the text, but it was not erected until later during King Sejong’s reign when Seo Gujeong drafted the record, with Kang Hee-myeong, Seong Im, and Jeong Ran-jong inscribing the title and written record, before it was erected.

Next, concerning the stone stupa, it is said by some in popular lore to be the reliquary of the Goryeo period's Prime Minister Tal Tal Budhwa built by Yuan craftsmen, which is the misinformation spread by ignorant people. According to the records of the stele and the Annals of Sejo, it states that in the 12th year of King Sejo, on April 8, it was completed (in the Western year 1467, making it 461 years ago). The following year, on April 8, the completion ceremony took place. (In the inscription, it says, “The stupa is completed,” reporting to hold a ceremony for the burning lamp.) However, this stupa, like the Won Gyeok Temple Stele, is also made of marble, reaching a height of about 40 feet. The stupa's base is constructed with three tiers of flower rock; thus, it is referred to as a ten-tier stupa because it combines the upper seven tiers with the lower three. It is alternatively referred to as a 13-tier stupa when counting up to the three-tier base. The upper seven tiers feature carvings of Buddha images on all four sides, while the lower three tiers present figures from 12 events (the Spirit Mountain, Three-World Buddha, Amitabha, Dragon Flower, Won Gyeok, Hwaeum, Many Treasures, Lotus Sutra, Candlestick Man, Disaster Prevention, Musicians, and Surangama) with naming plaques also inscribed. The base features three levels with dragons, lions, mystical beasts, human figures, birds and animals, lotus leaves, flora, sages, and palaces expertly carved; its craftsmanship is astonishing and stands as a major precious artifact in the architectural history of the Joseon Dynasty and is of significant value on a global scale.  

**Summary**

This article highlights the historical significance of the Won Gyeok Temple Stele and the nearby stupa, providing insights into the construction of Buddhist temples during the Joseon Dynasty. Notably, the article points out the stele's inscriptions and the artistic features of the stupa as examples of cultural heritage. From the perspective of Korean colonial history, it reflects on the blending of indigenous beliefs with state-sponsored Buddhism, capturing the shifting political and religious landscape of Korea in the past.

世界絶品 大圓覺師碑와 窣覩婆
						考古生
서울의 구경을 하는 사람은 누구나 塔洞公園을 한번 보랴고 할 것이요 그 공원을 구경하는 사람은 또한 그 공원 안에 잇는 圓覺寺碑(俗稱 거북碑)와 大理石塔을 보지 안이치 못할 것이다. 이 圓覺寺碑는대리석으로 맨긴 것이니 룡머리(螭首)까지 합하야 高가 11尺 5寸이요 幅이4尺 5寸이니 룡머리 표면에는 碑額이 잇서서「大圓覺寺之碑」6자를 篆字로 삭엿스니 그것은 李朝 成宗때에 명필 姜希孟의 親筆이요 碑의 前面의 碑文은 世祖때에 文臣 金守溫(乖厓)의 지은 것으로 成宗때에 文章으로 또는 명필로 유명한 成任이 親書하얏스며 또 後面의 文은 徐居正(四佳)이 짓고 字는 鄭蘭宗이 썻스니 룡머리와 거북 바탕(龜跌) 등의 彫刻이 奇妙함은 물론이요 上記한 2大 文章과 3大 名筆의 手蹟이 具備한 까닭에 朝鮮의 6絶碑라 稱하는 貴重品이다.
이 碑는 屢 100年間에 風磨雨洗하야 文字가 모도 剝落되엿슴으로 碑額 篆書 이외에는 잘 볼수가 업스나 다른 녯 기록에 참조하면 잘 알수 잇다. (例 如續東文選) 圓覺寺라는 절은 원래 高麗때의 興福寺로서 李朝 世祖때에 다시 重建하고 이름을 圓覺으로 고친 것이니 佛經의 圓覺經에서 取來한 것이다. 그 寺의 沿革은 이하의 碑文에 의하야 잘 알 것이다.
『世祖 10년 夏4월에 孝寧君(補)이 檜庵(京畿道 楊州郡 檜巖寺)의 東岡에 石鐘을 세우고 釋迦의 舍利를 置한 후 法會를 設하야 圓覺經을 講하니 是夕에 如來가 相을 공중에 現하는데 瑞氣가 彌布하더니 舍利가 800여粒으로 分身함으로 5월 甲寅의 日에 孝寧君은 그 靈跡을 具하고 舍利를 奉하야 上께 聞하니  王은 王妃와 共히 舍元殿에서 頂禮를 하고 百官은 箋을 上하야 賀을 稱하며 中外에 大赦를 行하고 이에 興福寺의 舊刹을 重營하야 이를 圓覺寺라 名하니 周圍가 2,000步이다.
興福寺는 太祖가 都를 漢陽에 定하던 때에 曹溪宗의 本寺로 삼엇더니 宗旨가 革罷됨을 따러 寺도 또한 廢하고 公廨가 되엿다가 世祖 10년 6월 乙卯日에 王이 親히 此에 幸하야 曰 白岳은 北을 鎭하고 木覓은 南에 供하고 位Š” 陽에 面하고 地는 爽塏하니 맛당이 大刹을 建함이 可하다 하고 곳 孝寧君을 命하야 提調를 삼고 그 役을 監莅케 한 후 먼저 假屋을 長隅에 構하고 佛殿을 造하기 始하얏더니 忽然히 黃雲이 屋上을 덥히고 空花繽墮의 瑞象이 잇슴으로 孝寧君 등은 馳하야 王겟 啓하니 王이 勤政殿에 御하야 羣臣의 賀를 受하고 赦를 肆하며＜134＞ 百官에게 爵 1級을 賜하고 또 9월 甲申의 日에는 正殿上에 瑞氣가 騰湧하야 舍元殿에 連瓦함으로 이에 役徒가 坌集하야 10월 乙卯에 이르러 終을 告하얏다. 佛宇는 중에  峙하야 額을 大光明殿이라 賜하고 左를 禪室 右를 雲集이라 하며 門을 寐光이라 하고 次의 門을 般若라 하고 그 外門을 解脫門이라 하얏다. 栖鍾의 宇가 잇스니 法雷閣이라 하고 供辨의 廠이 잇스니 香寂療라 하며 東偏에는 沼를 鑿하야 此에 扶渠(蓮)를 植하고 西에 園苑을 開하야 花卉를 植하며 正殿의 後에는 藏經을 藏하고 海藏殿이라 칭하얏다. 又 窣覩婆(梵書에 稱塔曰 窣覩婆) 13層을 建하야 分身舍利及新譯圓覺經을 安置하니 規模의 壯麗와 輪奐의 美는 其儷가 鮮하얏다.
翌年 4월8일에는 諸山의 韻釋을 召하야 法會를 設하고 新圓覺經을 轉落하고 又 明年 4월8일에는 窣覩婆 成하니 法會를 設하고 王이 또 한 親幸하니 僧尼 道俗의 瞻仰觀拜하는 자가 億萬에 計하고 還宮에 及하야는 歌謠를 獻하고 都人 士女가 *舞踴躍하얏다.』
此에 依하야 보면 寺의 起工은 世祖 10년 6월이오 役을 畢하기는 그 해 10월이고 落成式은 그 익년 4월 8일이다.(世祖實錄 11년 4월 7일 記錄에 「圓覺寺成, 設慶讚會, 赴會僧一百二十八, 披覽御定口訣, 翻圓覺修多羅了義經, 飯外護僧二萬, 是日幸圓覺寺」또 碑를 건립한 시기에 관하야는 그 碑文에 의하면 成化 7년 4월 日立이라 하얏슨 즉 成化는 明의 憲宗의 年號로 朝鮮 成宗 2년에 해당하고 西紀로는 1471년이니 距今 456년 前이다. 원래 이 碑도 圓覺寺를 創建한 즉시에 立하기로 계획하야 世祖가 文臣 金守溫으로 文을 撰케 하얏스나 王이 昇遐하심으로 碑를 立하지 못하고 후에 成宗때에 이르러서 徐居正으로 陰記를 撰하고 姜希孟, 成任, 鄭蘭宗등 3人으로 碑額, 及 碑文을 書케 하야 此를 立한 것이다.
次에 石塔에 관하야는 일부 俗間에서 말하기를 高麗時代의 元承相脫脫不花의 願塔으로 元人의 造作한 것이라 하나 그 것은 沒識者輩의 言이라 족히 齒할바 안이거니와 前述한 碑文이라던지 世祖實錄에 의하면 世祖 12년 4월 8일에 竣工하야(西紀 1467-距今 461年前) 翌 13년 4월 8일에 落成式을 行한 것이다.(상기 碑文에 云하되 又明年 四月八日(卽 世祖 11년4월 8일)以窣覩婆成, 轉法會라 하고 世祖實錄 13년 4월 8일 記事에 圓覺寺塔成, 說燃燈會以落成云云) 然而 이 塔身은 圓覺寺碑와 가티 역시 大理石으로 造成하얏스니 高가 약 40척이오 탑의 基壇은 3層의 花岡石으로 造成하얏는데 상부 7층과 하부 3층을 合하야 10층 塔이라고도 하고 又 此에 3층 基壇까지 느어서 13층탑이라고도 한다. 탑의 상부 7층에는 四面에 佛像을 刻하고 下部 3층에는 四面에 12會(靈山, 三世佛, 彌陀, 龍華, 圓覺, 華嚴, 多寶, 法華, 旃檀, 消災, 樂師, 楞嚴)의 圖를 刻하고 此에 各會명을 記한 匾頗가 잇고 又 基壇에는 3層에 共히 龍, 獅, 收丹, 人物, 鳥獸, 蓮葉, 草木, 羅漢, 宮殿 등을 鐫하얏스니 그 工藝의 巧妙함은 足히 人을 놀낸만하야 李朝 建築史上에 一大 貴重品인 동시에 세계적으로 자랑할만한 가치가 잇다. ＜135＞
