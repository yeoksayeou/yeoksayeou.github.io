Dream Road  
						劉道順  
The dream road every night  
Five hundred ri and a thousand ri,  
Only a ferryboat on the Cheongchun River crosses back and forth.

At the southern gate on the castle ruins,  
Yearning separation,  
Tears flowed as I could not cross the hill.

In the Ningbyeong region at Yak Mountain,  
You and I were  
Like Lee Do-ryeong and Chun-hyang on the West Road.

The dream road every night  
Five hundred ri and a thousand ri,  
Only a ferryboat on the Cheongchun River crosses back and forth.  

Full Moon Night  
Meeting you in my dreams, I weep,  
As I step out to the courtyard,  
Over the jar, the ashes settled,  
The full moon shines brightly.

Here, from Gaksan,  
Seven hundred fifty ri,  
On the mountain path, ten nights,  
Even merchants come and go.

Even swallows follow in flocks,  
Leaving from Gyeongnam,  
Without any message, Gaksan, seven hundred li,  
Letting the early autumn pass by without stopping.

Meeting you in my dreams, I weep,  
As I step out to the courtyard,  
Over the jar, the ashes settled,  
The full moon shines brightly.  

**Summary**  

This poem captures the emotional landscape of longing and separation, reflecting on the distance and yearning that defines the human experience. It resonates with the historical context of Korea in the late 1920s, a period of colonial oppression where personal and collective identities were deeply entwined in feelings of loss and nostalgia. The references to specific geographic distances and emotional separation can evoke a sense of the physical and psychological barriers faced by Koreans under Japanese rule, making it a poignant piece for historians examining cultural expressions of resistance and identity during this era.

꿈길
						劉道順
꿈길이 밤마다
五百理 또 千里에
淸川江 나룻배만 쉬여 건너오.

南門밧 城터밋헤
애닯흔 離別
압고개 못 넘어서 눈물 흘녓소.

寧邊에 藥山東坮
그대 나와는
西道의 李道令과 春香이엿소.

꿈길이 밤마다
五百理 또 千里에
淸川江 나룻배만 쉬여 건너오.＜114＞

달밤
꿈에 님 만나 울고
뜰에 나서니
장독 넘어 잿등에
보름달 소삿네.

여기서 甲山은
七百五十里
산길 밤낫 열흘이면
소장수도 왓다간다네.

제비도 때차저
江南을 떠나갈건만
消息업시 甲山七百里
체가을을 못니저 보냇네.

꿈에 님 만나 울고
뜰에 나서니
장독 넘어 잿등에
보름달 소삿네.＜115＞
＜114-115＞
