Magazine Subscription  

1. Do not write your name and address carelessly. 

(The magazine will come via the postal service.)

2. Clearly specify which month’s issue or which issue number you are ordering. 

(If you do not write the month, the magazine will easily get lost.)

3. Do not forget to add postal fees when sending your payment. 

(Because if we do not send the magazine and request payment by postcard, it becomes a disadvantage and causes losses.)

4. Please do not pay with a money order or postal stamps, but send your payment as much as possible via bank transfer. 

(There are concerns about loss during transit and the cost of sending money is expensive.)<105>  

**Summary**  

This article outlines important instructions for subscribers to a magazine, emphasizing the need for clear address details, payment methods, and specific issue identification. Notably, it highlights the challenges of postal service reliability during this time, indicating potential losses for both the publisher and subscribers.
