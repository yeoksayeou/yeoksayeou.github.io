The biting cold wind blows, and the bright moon is imbued within the snow. In the far-off city on the border, I stand, gazing at the long horizon, unperturbed by the howling sounds of the strong winds.  
(Kim Jong-soo)  

On Mount Changbai, I raise my flag, while speaking with others at the Duman River. Is it not the rotten scholar who lives among us? Who draws the distant lands at the Lingyan Pavilion?  
(Kim Jong-soo)  

On a bright night during the quiet moon, I stand at the dog tower, opening the large knife and hearing the resonance in the air. Where does the sound of the Hu Jia pierce my heart?  
(Yi Sun-shin)  

Feeding the red devil horse, washed away by the Duman River, I swiftly draw the sword that glimmers at Longquan. Shall I test the virtue and fame of a man?  
(Kim Su-jang)  

The ten-year sword rests in its sheath, looking out at the mountain pass. As I look upon it with anxiousness, where can the achievements of a man for his nation be strung?  
(Kim Su-jang)  

The Korean generals are full of spirit and heroism, with their seven-foot tall bodies and their fine swords. In hunting the shadowy mountains under three feet of snow, they return to drink the green grapes in the tents. As I become drunk, I ponder whether the southern barbarians are mere weeds.  
(Kim Do-seong)

**Summary**

This poem captures the spirit of nationalism and the heroic ideals prevalent during the late 1920s in Korea, reflecting the struggles against oppression and the yearning for sovereignty. The imagery of nature, swords, and generals evokes a sense of pride and aspirational identity unique to the Korean experience during colonial rule. Historians might find the references to figures like Yi Sun-shin and the underlying themes of valor significant in understanding the resurgence of Korean nationalism during this period.
