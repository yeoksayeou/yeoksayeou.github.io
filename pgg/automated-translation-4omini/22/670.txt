The Revival of the Nation and Sports  
						Seo Sang-cheon  
In the year 1806, the great army of France led by "Napoleon" defeated the Prussians at Jena and passed through Berlin to conclude an alliance with the Prussian King at Tilsit. Napoleon's global ambitions gradually achieved success. In contrast, Prussia was ravaged by France’s invasion, facing dire circumstances not only in military but also in economic and industrial sectors. The state of affairs at that time was truly devastating. The courage of the people was demoralized, and the spirit of cooperation and patriotism was withering away, putting the nation in a perilous state of existence. At that time, the patriot "Friedrich" embarked on a nationwide campaign with a speech titled "To the People of Germany," passionately calling for the necessity of new education to prepare for rearmament. Among many patriots, figures like "Scharnhorst" emphasized the need to advance sports as well. Thus, during the critical moments of Prussia's survival, sports played a vital role in inspiring patriotism, which led to immense success in the unity of the German people. This left an indelible mark in the annals of German history with the founding father of German sports, "Friedrich Ludwig Jahn," emerging as a prominent figure.

Let us take a brief look at the simple biography of this great man "Jahn." He was born on August 11, 1778, in a small village near Lanz. By age fourteen, he was educated by his father, a pastor, who instilled in him a beautiful sense of justice and a fervent patriotism toward his homeland. From a young age, he preferred not to socialize with peers but traveled throughout the country to study its situation and history. Later, he dropped out of "Berlin Gymnasium" and transferred to "Halle Seminary" to study theology, contrary to his own interests. In a book by Mr. Meier, he earnestly read the chapter regarding the need for education in youth struggles, inspiring him to write and publish a book in 1799 titled "Promotion of Patriotism toward the German People."

When Napoleon invaded Prussia in 1806, he decided to abandon his studies to join the army, yet was unable to participate due to timing. Witnessing the tragic aftermath of the defeat of the Prussian army near Jena filled him with intense indignation and sorrow, turning his hair white overnight at the age of twenty-nine. Subsequently, in 1810, he published a book titled "Prussian Statehood," which became a key to his political and athletic endeavors, serving as a dignified anthem for the unification of Germany led by Prussia. General "Blücher" praised this book as a national defense document.

He vigorously promoted sports to strengthen national defense and organized numerous compatriots and alliances for the independence of Prussia, as well as constructed a grand gymnasium. As the spirit of his compatriots was demoralized, leading the nation into increasingly desperate circumstances, he lamented the political, social, and ideological domains being dominated by the French and resolved to awaken the national spirit. He gathered youth at the gymnasium to create teams, march with national flags, sing the national anthem, and engage in competitive sports, striving to become a significant force in national revitalization.

At that time, Jahn's contributions to invigorating German sports and instilling a healthy German spirit among the youth were immensely significant. The success of Germany in subsequently defeating France in the Franco-Prussian War and reviving its status as a world power was greatly attributed to the spirit fostered through sports. While it has been but a few years since Germany's decisive defeat in the Great European War, the recovery of the national strength today is due to sports associations spread across the nation, from the central headquarters to local districts. No nation should overlook the vital economic revival of its people through sports, for it is an essential contribution to the nation’s resurrection.  

**Summary**  

The article discusses how sports played a key role in revitalizing the German spirit and patriotism in the face of national crises, particularly during the Napoleonic Wars. It highlights the contributions of Friedrich Ludwig Jahn, who organized sports as a means to empower the nation. This perspective provides historians with insights into how national identity and unity can be fostered through physical education, particularly relevant in the context of Korea's colonial history when similar movements were emerging.

西紀一八○六年佛國「나폴레온」의 大軍이「예나」에서 普軍을 擊破하고 長縣伯林을 過하여 普王다「지루짓도」에서 盟約을 締結하니「나폴레온」의 世界的野心의 政策은 漸漸成功하게되엿다 그 反面으로 普國은 佛國에게 ■■되여 軍事는 物論經濟産業各方面에 잇서서 當時의 狀態가 實로 慘憺하여젓다 딸아 國民의 勇氣가 沮喪되며 協同團結의 精神과 愛國奉仕의 氣魂이 項廢하여 國家는 正히 危急存亡의 秋에서게되얏다 當時의 愛國者「후이히데」는「獨逸國民에게 告함」이란는 題로서 全國을 巡廻演說하며 復■戰에 備할 新敎育의 必要을 絶叫하엿섯고 當時幾多의 憂國烈士中에「시유타인」과 如한 者는 或은 演說로 或은 建白書로서 軍備를 完備하며 特＜170＞히 體育을 向上식힐것을 力說하엿섯다 如此한 普國危急存亡의 秋를 當하여 體育으로서 愛國心을 鼓吹하여 獨逸國民의 團結에 至大한 成功을싸어 獨逸歷史와 함게 永遠不滅할일홈을남긴 獨逸體育의 始祖「후리-드ㆍ루도우이리ㆍ양」이라는 사람이 頭角을 露出하게되얏다 이와가티 普國의 危機一髮의 를 當하여 體育으로서 愛國心을 鼓舞하고 이로서 祖國의 新生命을 展開한 偉人「양」의 簡單한 復歷을보자 氏는 西歷一七七八年八月十一日「랜쓰」附近一小農村에 誕生하며 十四歲에 至하기지 當時牧師이 職으로잇든 自己父親으로부터엇기어려운 正, 不正에 對한 아름다운 感情과 祖國에 對한 烈烈한 愛國心을 喚酲하는 敎育을바더섯다 幼時로부터 同輩와 交際하기를조와하지안코 호울노 國內를 通歷하며 國情과 歷史의 硏究를조와하엿다 後에「伯林구라우엔구로스테」高等學校를 中途에 退學하고 自己嗜好에는 反하는 神學을 硏究하기 爲하여「하루레」神學校로 轉學하엿다.「마이에루」氏著書中에「靑年의 戰鬪에 關한 敎育의 必要」라는 章을 熟讀하고 크게 發憤하여 一九七九年에「普國國民에 對하여 愛國心을 促進」이라는 冊을 著述하여 出版하여 宣傳한 事도 有하엿다 一八○六年「나폴레온」이 大軍을 率하고 普國을 侵入하엿슬쩍에 氏는 祖國을 爲하여 學業을 廢하고 從軍하기 爲하여「예나」向하엿스나 때가임이느저 參加치못하고「예나」附近에서 普軍敗戰의 慘狀을 目擊하자 極度의 憤慨와 悲痛은 二十九歲의 靑年의 頭髮의 一夜에 白雪로 化케하여섯다 그後 一八一○年獨逸國體라는 冊을 出版하여섯다 此書는 氏의 政治的體育的行爲의 鍵인 同時에 普國을 盟主로한 獨逸統一의 尊貴한 歌이엿다「부루유해루」將軍은 此書을 國防書라고지 讚揚하여섯다 氏는 體育을 旺盛커하여 國防을 實充實케하고 普國獨立의 目的을 達하기 爲하여 當時多數한 同志와 獨逸同盟을 組織하며 同時에 一大體操場을 建設하엿다 同胞의 情神이 沈滯하여 國家가 漸次悲慘한 境遇에 入하며 政治上은 勿論壯交上思想上格方面에 佛人의 支配를 受하는것을 歎慨하여 如何히하든지 國民의 愛國心을 喚起起하여 祖國의 自由를 回復하기로 決心하고 體操場에 靑年을 糾合하여 團隊를 作하고 或은 國旗를들고 國歌를 高唱하여 行列을하고 或은 競技體操를 行하여 國力復興上一大勢力을 得하기에 努力하엿든것이다. 當時獨逸의 體育과 靑年에게 健全한 獨逸魂魄을 注入함에는「양」의 貢獻이 至大하엿다 獨逸이 그 後普佛戰爭에 佛國을 擊破하여 復興을하고 世界的獨逸이된것은 全혀 體育에힘입은바가 多하여섯다. 現今大歐洲戰에 慘敗한지 不過年歲에벌서 國力이 回復이됨은 中央에 本部를두고 全國道郡面村에 體育組合이 散在하여 體育으로 唯一의 回生濟로쓴닭이나 어느 民族이던지 그 民族이잘살랴하면 이 偉大한 回生濟의 體育을 獎勵하지아니치못할것이며 圓時에 그 體育은 그 民族의 甦生에 貢獻할 體育이아니되면안될 것이다.＜171＞
