京城男女總出誌上大忘年會-웃지안으면 退會命令  
主催 觀相者  

I. Membership Qualifications  
This event is a single year-end party concentrated on the total power of men and women of all of Gyeongseong, so anyone who is a Korean resident in Gyeongseong can participate. However, due to the concern that the venue may become too crowded without a membership fee, membership cards will be distributed with specific qualifications as follows:  

1. Graduates of women's laughter schools.  
2. Those who reject any ideology that promotes division.  
3. Those who adhere to the drunken face maintenance law.  
4. Those who have thoroughly researched the issues of gold and alcohol prohibition.  
5. Those who can optimally enjoy the party until the last moment.  

However, those who have loved reading "Byeolgeon-gwon" for over a year can join regardless of the above qualifications.  

II. Roll Call of Members  
From now on, we will call the names of members present. Simply stating names is too bland and tasteless, and may leave people unable to remember well, which would be impolite. Therefore, we will use a format inspired by the traditional yet modern "Chunhyangga" (春香歌) for the roll call. One thing I ask for your understanding is that this gathering is solely for laughter and enjoyment. When called, everyone should respond cheerfully and with a smile; anyone appearing angry or displeased would disturb the peacefulness of this season. Consequently, under the alcohol constitution law, those showing displeasure will be prohibited from attending such gatherings for a year. Please pay attention to this in advance.  

Now – let us begin the roll call. We will draw from characters in "Chunhyangga." Please respond with a smile. No anger, please. Ready –

III. One Minute Speech  
Now, we will proceed with the one-minute speech. The topic is free to choose from your preferences but limited to humorous subjects only. Those who participate must pull their pants up neatly; if not, it is easy to cause embarrassment. Please be considerate.  

◇ President of White Rice, Yoo Jin-tae, takes the stage  
Title: Praise of White Rice  
I am a white rice-tiger who eats a lot of white rice.  

First, white rice is notably pure white, and secondly, it is round and has a wholesome shape, thirdly, when eaten, it helps to bear sons! Just like you all say, my mouth waters just thinking about it… rice cake… rice cake…  

◇ Executive Committee Chairman Hong Myeong-hee takes the stage  
Title: The Proletariat and Baldness  
Our proletariat, like me, must all lose our hair so we can maintain our livelihood. First, we must keep looking at others' things. Second, it’s necessary to install flashy lights. Third, we can save on barber fees. Lastly, in summer, when flies are clean, they die from their impact, necessitating the purchase of catching ropes. Looking at these points, we can see how beneficial being bald is for the working class… here and there shining brightly…  

◇ Professor of Malnutrition Lee Gi-young takes the stage  
Title: Mannerism of Malnourishment.  
Mannerism… mannerism… For example, the so-called Malnutritional Mannerism followed by my dear friend, Malnutritional Master, is to spend thirty years exactly like me, born on the same day in the same month. According to this person’s viewpoint on life, the body of love does not have any service; rather, just bones can do everything. Even if there are enemies armed with swords attacking, they cannot take even a piece of flesh. His most enjoyable thing during his lifetime has been to eat well in the dry times, and when the wind rises, he takes flight on an airplane without having to miss his flight! (Time exceeded, halted)  

◇ Bulky Women's Alliance President Son Jeong-kyu takes the stage  
Title: Beauty Techniques for Bulky Women.  
First, when applying powder, it is important to start with thick powder to prevent pores from getting blocked. Second, you should always wear a net over your face. Third, when it comes to what you eat, you need to pay attention to things like pumpkin (가보자), rice cakes (가다방), shredded metal leaves, and honeycomb (蜜蜂巢). When walking, do not be distracted by bean rings…  

◇ Deaf Institute Principal Kim Mi-ri takes the stage  
Title: How Noisy the World Is…  
Ah, this world is really noisy. Unlike normal persons, those that cannot hear might appear undesirable. Even when the strong fire cannons, it just seems like a light fargue to them, and even when thousands of horses scream and cry, they will only appear yawning. Ah… my ears…  

◇ Little People’s Alliance Leader Yoo Ok-kyung takes the stage  
Title: Our Factional Disputes.  
Our short people seem to have many factions. Among them, the first fraction is the so-called "hole faction", the second with eyes is "feature faction", and the third with mouth is called "only faction". Seeing the world where height seems to have a purpose, yet in reality, short people justify factional conflicts; Therefore, no matter what you do, we must avoid these disputes (Many members such as Choi Seung-woo, Park Ji-hwa, Park Pal-yang, Jin Chang-seop, and Kwon Jin-kyu give big applause of agreement).  

◇ Left-Handed Eating Faction Leader Huh Seon takes the stage  
Title: Eating with the Left Hand and Work Efficiency.  
Look! My hand! My hand!  
I have gotten used to eating with the left hand. If others eat with their left hand, can we not improve efficiency when doing tasks simultaneously? Nowadays, ordinary people only use the right hand anyway; naturally, the efficiency of the left hand decreases. Everyone! When you clap along with me, make sure to do it with your left hand!  

◇ Talented People’s Bureau Head Kwon Deok-kyu takes the stage  
Title: Talents and Socialization.  
What is talent? It’s a hot issue. Why must there be talent? I thought this gathering was a year-end gathering, but it’s turned into a forgettable upset. (This too is talent, and the audience bursts into laughter).  

◇ Various Factions’ Moaji Min Gye-seok takes the stage  
Title: Beards and Product Rewards.  
Everyone! Just like this time of economic upheaval, we should also reward our Moaji on chilly days. If we don’t wrap our necks in winter, it seems that the cold wind could make the experience terrible. However, if we properly trim the hair in winter, we’ll end up with considerable profits in summer. (Time exceeded, halted)  

◇ Danbukeong Children’s Association President Park Jeong-hwan takes the stage  
Title: The Great Propulsion of Danbukeong.  
Once upon a time, there was a very fat Danbukeong general. That general had no power or sword, yet brilliantly occupied others' territories. When fighting the enemy, he would just roll toward the enemy and capture them. Every enemy army would crumble at his mighty force. (Time exceeded, halted)  

IV. Entertainment  
In this entertainment, the men performed first, but for this time, the women will be our first performers. The subject will be to demonstrate one's skills in performance or song, whatever they may possess. Now – we shall commence with Han Cheong-gwang's song, "The Great Rock of Samgak Mountain".  

In the first act, Choi Seung-hee will demonstrate a dance performance.  
Tap-ta-tap, tap-ta-tap… (as the legs seem a bit loose; it’s blissful… roar of audience applause once more)  

In the second act, the lady of Chunwon, Lee Gwang-soo’s wife, Heo Young-suk, will come forward with her hidden talent of the song "Panga".  
"As you gently tread onto the stones, crossing the rocky hill, the colorful brick wall is my home in Suongsam-dong, at the peach tree, where I’ll call you in spring…" (The child cries, making it difficult for her to continue).  

In the third act, Jeong Jong-myeong will bring forward a yangsan.  
"Dang Ming-huang's Yang Guifei is but a lady like this…" (laughter from audience).  

In the fourth act, the beautiful Mexican lady, Woo Bong-un, with a mounted ear will sing "Immo".  

Everyone, please do not forget your tears as we sing sadly, "Lonely world - in this terrifying sea, am I the only love for you…"  

In the fifth act, Jeong Chul-woo will perform on the kayagum.  
"Dang-dang-dang-dang, go there quickly, living life till the end with my companions…"  

In the sixth act, Kim Jeong-won will dance like a farmer.  
"Ouch, I can’t wear this hair well…" (She struggles to adjust her appearance).  

In the seventh act, Hwang Sin-deok will sing a lullaby for the little boar.  
"Sleep, sleep, sleep quickly, our baby bong…"  

Now, the men will have the performance next. The new commander Jin Hong-jin will play the drum while Ju Gyeok-yeol of the Dong-A Ilbo will do a long song along with the dancing whites, Lee Haeng-jong of the Korean Bank will dance the flamboyant dance, and Lee Doo-seong of the Heaven Doctrine Association will also dance.  

At this moment, the audience's watching includes Heo Jeong-seok’s dancing and Park Ho-jin’s joyful kneading. Then, following will be Lee Byung-ki’s time readjustment, Yoo Do-soon’s "Celebration Song," Kim Hyeong-won’s "Joyful Song," Kim Jin-kyu’s "Joyful Singing,” and Baek Nam-kyu’s arithmetic song (Hey, be careful with the song!).  

Ultimately, "Are you coming far over to the other side?" is performed by Choi Gyu-dong’s "Six-word clap". Oh dear! We have misordered the presentation. Female vocalists Park Kyung-gi and Kim Mal-boon begin from late. Everyone, please forgive us… Now it’s getting late, and the dining time is approaching, and we shall conclude the fun with the praise song by Kim Hwal-ran. Please enjoy the dishes from the recipes of Son Jeong-kyu and Bang Sin-yeong. Have a good New Year!  

<100-105>
