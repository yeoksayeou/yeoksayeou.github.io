The Grand Prize Problem of White Rice  
It is something quite easy to understand.  

Hasten to submit your answers within the deadline!  

Please carefully look at the photograph at the beginning of this book. The photograph above shows five women from the Do-Wol Club's dance department dressed in disguise. Identify who each person is dressed as, and if you think person one is "A," then write: "One is A... Two is N..." and so on this answer sheet.  

Those who know should cut out the paper below, write their answers on it, and clearly add their address and name before sending it in an envelope by December 25.  

One hundred individuals will receive special prizes from our company (if there is any regional office, it will be sent in cash).  

**Summary**  

This article invites readers to participate in a fun competition by identifying the disguised individuals in a photograph, offering white rice as a grand prize for one lucky winner among several others who correctly answer. The playful nature of such competitions highlights the cultural connections and social activities enjoyed during the colonial period in Korea. Historians may find the communal engagement and the emphasis on prizes indicative of broader societal interests and commercial practices under colonial rule, reflecting both entertainment and a form of consumerism emerging in Korean society at the time.
