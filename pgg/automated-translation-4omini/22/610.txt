The Martial and Civil Dualities of the Ten Thousand Households  
Tōgawa Shin Kōran  
Tōgawa the Hero! If we speak of Tōgawa the Hero, Shin Chul-gok, he is a name known to all in the Hamgyŏng region. His full name is Yuk-kyu, with his courtesy name being Sil-ji. Chul-gok, a name derived from having served as the governor of Chulgok in Gyeongsangnam-do, was born into a prestigious family; he was the descendant of the Minister of Construction and was born on the twelfth day of the second month in the spring of the year of the Earth Rabbit of King Injo. Though his lineage was undeniably distinguished at that time, he inherited a significant flaw, as his great-grandfather had unfortunately failed in his duties, risking the family's reputation. 

His great-grandfather's misfortune meant that he came into the world as an illegitimate child, impacting not just himself but also his family, leading them to be downgraded socially and subjected to insults like “illegitimate grandsons” and “branch families.” This ugly custom was prevalent in his time, and in such a situation, was Shin Chul-gok the only one to endure this? 

Having been born into an eternally unfortunate family, being a descendant of an illegitimate child only deepened the sorrow with regards to his future. From an early age, he showcased remarkable martial prowess and extraordinary intellect, astonishing those around him. During the winter season, despite the extreme cold, he attended school and achieved excellent results. In summer, he tended to cattle and frequently ventured into the deep valleys known for their scenic beauty, practicing calligraphy with charcoal and ink ceaselessly, occasionally composing poetry and learning swordsmanship. 

At this time, the royal court was plagued by factional rivalries surrounding class power, which led to numerous struggles and oppression of the people, as the two ruling classes contended for power in the village schools and local factional strongholds, causing great disturbance in Tōgawa. Yet, as an illegitimate child, there was no way for Shin Chul-gok to seek an official position, and he faced various forms of oppression, leading to deep unrest within him, expressed only in short sighs and long exhalations directed at the heavens. As he was unable to suppress this raging flame within him, at twenty-nine years of age, he left his hometown of Tōgawa, gazing blankly into the distance as he headed south toward Han-yang.

In the year of the Earth Monkey of King Sukjong, Shin Chul-gok achieved success in the martial examination with his outstanding skills. He progressed further to serve in key military posts such as the commander of the 3rd Army Corps in Hamhŭng, and the chief officer of Gohyŏng. When in the company of talented poets and scholars, he would inspire them with heartfelt writings, and when mingling with distinguished warriors, he would exhibit his spirited attitude. Wherever he appeared, his vibrant personality and exceptional talents would seize the attention of everyone present, earning him the titles of both Tōgawa's hero and Han-yang's hero. 

On one occasion, boldly armed, he entered the hall of the National Academy. The elegant scholars, donned in ceremonial attire, were seated, engaged in discussions. One of the scholars, seeing the warrior, warmly welcomed him, but failing to recognize who was present, Shin Chul-gok, feeling discomfort and melancholy, wrote this epitaph in that hall and departed: “Youth in blue robes, do not mock a body clad in iron; for I too have spent years as a scholar. The slightest bit only remembers the moon at midnight; with my short sword, I can cleanse the dust from the four seas.” 

Once in spring, high-ranking scholars from the ruling class gathered in a mountain village for a feast and poetry gathering. Hearing of this, Shin Chul-gok went uninvited and took a seat at the end of the table. Noticing something intriguing, he found that whoever presented a poem first would receive complimentary drinks and food for the day. Taking this opportunity, Shin Chul-gok, standing resolutely, looked to the gathering and said, “As an unlearned warrior, the only thing I know is the Hangul (the vernacular) of my time; thus, even if it is in Hangul, I dare to compose a verse.” The scholars, seeing his character, all responded affirmatively. Before moving on, Shin Chul-gok recited a poem: “Awake, oh good fellows, as the last of the articles is done, the brilliant flowers bloom, joyful and festive, in the light of the bright moon.” The scholars were taken aback, and thus drinks were swiftly poured.

At this time, Minister of Military Affairs Kim Seok-wi, known for his virtue and famed reputation, had a foster daughter named Baek-ju, whose virtue, intelligence, and beauty were unmatched. Minister Kim wished to bestow a worthy spouse upon her and declared that would-be suitors must have the qualifications of Bird of Paradise Bridge and the phrase “Three Characters of Boat’s Head,” which would guarantee them the position of Baek-ju's husband. Shin Chul-gok, being a distinguished man of great spirit, pushed through the crowd of suitors and personally submitted his application in writing. What became of this was that he indeed overcame the competition and married Baek-ju, leading to unparalleled happiness. His poem read: “Drifting on the currents in Baek-ju, how many years do I hold back the blue waves? Should someone ask who crossed first, it is both the martial prowess and civil achievements of the ten thousand households.”

From then on, Shin Chul-gok received the love of Minister Kim, and in short order, he served as governor in various districts such as Deok-gyeong, Jin-ju, In-san, An-yak, and now Gyeong-chang, where he established strong governance. As a figure of great accomplishment among the warriors, the envy surrounding him grew stronger. Alas! The life of a hero encountered numerous challenges! 

During this period, intense factional conflicts arose in the royal court, and there were plans to execute Prince Bok-chang, a son of Lord In-pyung. Worsening matters, Shin Chul-gok was assigned as the official envoy, charged to bring about the capture of Bok-chang, who was said to possess both wisdom and bravery. As he faced this daunting task, Shin Chul-gok silently prepared for the mission. Meanwhile, his beloved Baek-ju, seeing her husband facing dire circumstances, worried about him significantly.

Donning armor, Shin Chul-gok mounted his steed leading the charge against the dissidents. The horse was indeed a legendary steed. It was an autumn night when the leaves were rustling and the full moon shone brightly. Shin Chul-gok thought, “Ah! Our success lies within this night!” as he advanced heroically, and the dragon horse seemed to sense the moment, exerting its strength as they boldly tackled the traitors. Shin Chul-gok roared like an angry tiger, and as he swung his long sword, it swept through the air like a comet. Bok-chang could not move and was captured and executed. Due to this achievement, he was awarded the title of a first-class merit holder alongside Ministers Kim Seok-wi and Kim Mun-gok.

However, even amidst the success, he tasted the bitterness of jealousy, having held positions in the Office of Censor and the Central Council before eventually being appointed as Chulgok's governor, where his ambitions also proved challenging. As the wolf that bites, to capture the white tiger, had caused immense suffering among the populace. 

Thus, Shin Chul-gok, now known by the title of Governor, began his tenure by devising strategies to capture the biting white tiger, eliminating this major issue. He expended his entire monthly salary and amassed abandoned military equipment and over seven thousand rounds of gunpowder. His efforts attracted the attention of the observing minister Lee Ra-yong, who reported his deeds to the royal court, where King Sukjong recognized him, presenting an official letter of commendation, and an honored horse for his accomplishments. 

But since Shin Chul-gok hailed from the northern region, he harbored no further hope of climbing the official ladder, and nearing the age of sixty, the longing for his hometown grew unbearable, prompting him to resign and return to Tōgawa. Upon arrival, while outwardly welcomed, there existed a number of people harboring resentment. Internally, he still faced the biases of being labeled an “illegitimate grandson.” 

As he initially attended the local office, he witnessed the rude expressions displayed by those in positions of power, and feeling incensed, Shin Chul-gok mounted his horse and, holding a baton, approached the office. At that time, the rather grand entrance of the office happened to be in his way. Shin Chul-gok, halting his horse, issued a command and shattered the large gate with ease, paving the way for himself to exit slowly. As events unfolded in this manner, the atmosphere of jealousy and conspiracy worsened day by day. Eventually, unable to endure the situation, he moved with his family to a place called Anbyeon.

Oh, the ignorance of Tōgawa! The uncouthness of the Shin clan! How poignantly it is that Shin Chul-gok faced such hardship! 

From this point onwards, reflecting upon past events, Shin Chul-gok renounced worldly ambition and chose to work the land with his children while cherishing reading. He established a peaceful existence, reaching the age of sixty-nine in the spring, when the cherry blossoms bloomed and the cuckoos sang on the fifteenth of the third month, marking his passage into eternity, settling peacefully in an abode located in Gaeji-ri, Tōgawa. Alongside Baek-ju and familiar horses, they lived harmoniously, remembering a life of grandeur. What can be said about a hero's life?

Summary  

This detailed narrative chronicles the life of Shin Chul-gok, a man of great stature and martial prowess from Tōgawa, who, despite facing social stigma as an illegitimate child, became a respected figure through his feats and governance. The text highlights the trials he endured from jealousy and societal prejudice, ultimately retiring to a life of tranquility. Historians may find interest in the reflections of social hierarchies during the colonial period, particularly how concepts of legitimacy and social position impacted individuals' lives and careers, reflecting broader themes of identity and status in Korea's colonial history.
