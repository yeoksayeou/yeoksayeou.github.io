Master: "Oh, didn't that letter go into the mailbox?"  
Servant: "Yes, it did, but it seems that the postage was applied incorrectly. It costs three coins to send it abroad, but twenty coins to send it within the city."  
Master: "Really! How could that happen?"  
Servant: "Well, there's no need to worry. Moreover, the incorrect one has already been sent back. If you just wrote down the address on the皮封 (envelope), that would be sufficient, right?"  
Master: "……………"

Seeing her husband who has signed up for life insurance,  
Wife: "Honey! I want to join the insurance too!"  
Husband: "It's unnecessary for both of us."  
Wife: "But just having you signed up isn't going to amount to much."  
Husband: "That's true!"  
Wife: "Then, if we spend all that money, we could create an ideal family."  
Husband: "That would be the case! Then it would be ten thousand won."  
Wife: "So that means if we have children later, it will be fifteen thousand won, right?"  

**Summary**

The article consists of two humorous anecdotes, one about a misunderstanding regarding postal fees and the other about a couple discussing life insurance. The first joke highlights a common mix-up regarding mailing costs, which reflects the bureaucratic confusions often faced during the colonial period. The second joke reveals societal notions of family and financial security during the late 1920s, illustrating the aspirations of ordinary families amid economic uncertainties. Historians might find the juxtaposition of humor and mundane life amidst colonial pressures reveals deeper cultural attitudes towards both governance and domestic life.
