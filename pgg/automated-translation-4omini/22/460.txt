Manchuria includes the provinces of Fengtian (奉天), Jilin (吉林), and Heilongjiang (黑龍江) in northeastern China, with an estimated area of 64,700 square miles, which is approximately four and a half times greater than Korea. The agricultural land in Manchuria consists of 13 million chōbu of uncultivated land and 12 million chōbu of cultivated land, totaling 25 million chōbu, confirming its vast expanse compared to Korean agricultural land. The yield includes 27 million seok of millet, 32 million seok of soybeans, 14 million seok of corn, and 7 million seok of wheat, totaling an estimated 120 million seok. 

In the ancient virgin forests of the Yalu River and Songhua River basins, a peaceful atmosphere of idle clouds and wild cranes wafts through. The presence of gold, iron, and coal in Manchuria forms an enormous world treasure that is difficult to estimate. The climate has extreme variations between heat and cold, making it essential to wear fur in winter; it can be said that "your head freezes in Manchuria." The first snow falls around October 10 and continues into mid-spring, presenting a wonder where green trees and white snow coexist on sunny slopes. 

While the areas near the railway are relatively accessible, beyond that lies harsh terrain, and due to the absence of bridges over rivers, horse-drawn carts cannot travel during the ice season. Many places, especially during spring, summer, and autumn, are also impassable for horse carts, with vast stretches of uninhabited forest covering hundreds of miles. 

Thus, due to the vast land and poor transport conditions, horse thieves have become a characteristic feature of Manchuria (though this does not deny the social deficiencies). It is often reported that there are times when the horse thieves roam, creating a somewhat unstable situation in Manchuria. In northern and southern Manchuria, administrative districts have been established for the horse thieves who set regular taxes like household taxes. Though eastern Manchuria (in the Jinhe area) is not as severely affected, incidents of damage from horse thieves are not rare.

Manchuria is famous for its low grain prices. During the harvest season, millet sells for between 30 and 40 coins per bucket, and the price of grain speaks for itself. Daily necessities are generally pricier than in Korea, especially salt, which is almost unexcelled worldwide, ranging from 15 coins to 25 coins per hundred mŏ (百匁). Salt is a monopoly product of the Chinese government, and thus its insecure monopoly system increases consumption for the general populace. 

The main export products are largely agricultural items, industrial raw materials (iron, coal, building materials, leather, etc.), whereas imports consist of cotton fabrics, hemp bags, tobacco, machinery, and wheel parts. Because production goods (exports) are low-cost while other daily necessities (imports) are expensive, the lives of the farming class (particularly the impoverished farmers among them) must surely be harsh. 

What is the living condition of our compatriots in Manchuria? It has been a long time since Koreans began to migrate to Manchuria, historically considered Korean territory, but large-scale migration began only in recent years, particularly within the last decade. Politically and economically insecure living conditions have inevitably increased the number of migrants, which now reaches over one million—making the issues of Koreans in Manchuria part of the Korean question. They largely engage in agriculture; eastern Manchuria has a comparatively lengthy history of migration, leading to some level of economic stability among smallholders. However, the entire northern and southern Manchuria consists mainly of tenant farmers. 

In the northern Manchuria areas around Ningguta, there are some smalllandholdings among settler households, but this is an extremely rare exception. Among tenant farmers, while the duration of migration varies, those who newly arriveding find it difficult to obtain all necessities from the landowner companies or wealthy landlords. Even a moderately successful farming season leaves them with little surplus to spare. There is a prevalent saying: "If you can’t live in Korea, go to Manchuria!" As soon as one recognizes this, they may believe that Manchuria is the only paradise for Koreans, but the reality is that the painful life in a foreign land is difficult to imagine for those without actual experience.

In the midst of these hardships, the educational zeal, which has been intensifying rapidly since the March First Movement (三一運動), has extended to Manchuria, where almost every village now has elementary schools. Among the Koreans in Manchuria, there are a total of eight middle education institutions. Regionally, there are six in eastern Manchuria (Ryongjing), two in southern Manchuria (Yuhwa), and the schools are run by Koreans (four), English-run (Presbyterian Church) (two), and Japanese-run (two). All Korean-run schools are coeducational, and students’ freedom is fully secured within the school. Therefore, truancy compared to Korea is relatively low, tied to the political context of "senchō shun."

The inadequacies of facilities reflect the economic reality; recently, it has been reported that the National Government's educational policy is focused on integrating foreign educational institutions and all Korean-run schools into public schools and that measures are being taken for middle schools to become provincial establishments. Should this be fully realized, the development of Koreans in Manchuria would face significant obstacles.

Manchuria is part of Chinese territory; nonetheless, due to the conditions of unequal treaties, Koreans in Manchuria are under the dual political administration of both Chinese sovereignty and Japanese consulates. 

Japan's administrative police authority is limited to open areas, yet even in eastern Manchuria, the administration extends beyond these open areas. This is what is referred to as the dual political control situation over Koreans in Manchuria. Economic insecurity and the absence of protective measures tied to political oppression inevitably promote significant social movements, which are currently transforming the entire social landscape of Manchuria.

The main organizations active in this context include the former Hwang Province Association in eastern Manchuria, Jinbuk Young Men’s Group, Eastern Manchuria Youth Association, Former Labor Alliance, Jin友 Longjing Branch, and the Heavenly Way Youth Party Manchuria Unification Department, Eastern Manchuria Shared Benefit Society, among others.

Japan has leased Lüshunkou (旅順) and Dalian (大連) for strategic points in Manchuria. The South Manchuria Railway, which weaves through the vast plains of Manchuria like a long serpent, exists. Towns along the railway prosper as Japanese attachments, and to maintain law and order in these areas, Japan retains military and police presence. After the Russo-Japanese War, Japan’s investments reached hundreds of millions, forming the foundations of Japan's "special interests." 

Manchuria is currently under scrutiny globally, surrounded by contradictions that circulate around it. Is not the world's contradictions focused on Manchuria? (End)

  

**Summary**

This article explores the multifaceted conditions in Manchuria, particularly focusing on the historical migration of Koreans, agricultural productivity, and the socio-economic struggles faced by the Korean diaspora. It highlights the dual political control over Koreans by Chinese entities and Japanese colonial authorities, emphasizing the precarious living conditions and educational developments in Manchuria. Historians might find the insights into Korean migration trends, the socio-political dynamics, and the prevailing conditions that shaped Korean diasporic identity in the early 20th century particularly revealing.
