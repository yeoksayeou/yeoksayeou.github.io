Editorial Room Notes  

It was just yesterday that we finished editing the New Year's issue, and now we are already editing the New Year's farewell issue. I feel the passing of time more than others. If we only managed to publish a regular monthly magazine, I would be somewhat relieved; however, due to our circumstances, we have only been able to publish seven times throughout the year, which is truly regrettable.  

However, starting from the new year, we aim to publish daily and significantly expand and refresh our magazine. Already in preparation for this, we have welcomed two talented writers, Chae Man-sik and Park No-eul, along with two female journalists, Seong San-hui and Kim Won-joo, into our team. I hope our readers will look forward to this in advance. (Cha)  

This issue is special as it marks the third anniversary of our magazine's founding and also serves as the year's farewell issue; therefore, in addition to previously published essays, academic lectures, and literature, it is filled with uniquely special articles, making it truly a valuable year-end read. I hope everyone will have fun reading it. (Park Duri)  

As I experienced editing for the first time, everything was quite unfamiliar; however, as they say, one cannot satisfy hunger with just one meal. I believe that gradually, things will improve. I hope for your continued support, dear readers. (Chae)  

It is indeed an awkward situation to have one female journalist among a group of men in any company. Yet, our organization has only one female reporter, and I can see how much this influences our mood and enhances productivity. I sincerely hope that our female employees will increase, allowing our magazine to be produced with greater simplicity. (Seong)  

In the midst of experiencing a reporter's life for the first time, I've encountered various struggles. However, on the flip side, my network has expanded, and I’ve gained a richer understanding of social issues, which I consider a significant piece of learning in my life. I aim to make the utmost effort so that our female reporters will not lag behind their male counterparts. (Kim)  

Starting from the new year, we plan to significantly expand our pages and ensure that the previously underrepresented literary section will feature in every issue, showcasing not only the works of renowned authors but also new, vibrant pieces from emerging talent. I am already excited thinking about the poetry that will touch your hearts and ignite indignation, as well as the great novels that will elevate your taste and grant you a new consciousness of life. I hope deeply that this excitement, rooted in the true spirit of the Korean people, merges with our readers. (Park)  

Mr. Bang, who is rather plump, returned from Tokyo, and our general affairs department seems to be in great shape. I hope he properly oversees the company's matters while also enjoying the sushi and sweets over there; I wish he would bring some back for us... (Servant) <126>  

**Summary**  

This article serves as a reflection from the editorial team of 별건곤 (Byeolgeongon) as they transition into a new year of publishing. The team expresses a mix of regret for their limited outputs throughout the year and optimism for future improvements, especially with the introduction of new staff. It outlines a vision for expanding literary content and engaging readers more effectively. This glimpse into the magazine's struggles and ambitions reveals the challenges faced by Korean publications during the colonial era and highlights the importance of women's participation in the workforce, a significant social issue at the time.

◇新年號를 編輯한지가 어제와가튼데 벌서 送年號를 編輯하고나니 세월의 른것을 남보다 더욱늣기게된다. 그나마 維誌나달달이 定期發行을하엿스면 오히려들섭섭하겟지만 우리 事情은 如意히되지못하고 一年中겨우 七回를내여놋코 떡국한그릇의 신세를 짓게되니 너무도억울한일이다.

◇첨으로 記者生活을하는 中에 外勤을맛치맛게되니섬억섬억한일이만타. 그러나 그代로 交際가넓어지고 社會事情을만히알개되니 그것이나의 큰공부인가한다 이압흐로 最善의 努力을하야 우리 女子도 男子에지게안는 活躍을하랴한다.(金)
◇新年부터는 紙面을 大擴張하야 엿해아지 업섯든 文藝欄을 每號마다 두기로하고 各大家는 勿論이요 氣銳가 斬新하 新進들의 作品도만히실을한다. 將次우리 文藝欄에실니는 詩가 여러분을울니게하고 義憤에게하는 感激을주고 名作小說들이여러분의 趣味를 向上하여 새로운 生活意識을가지시게할것을 생각하면 발서부터 興奮이되여 감삼이논다. 못조록 이것이 朝鮮사람의 참된 精神에서 울여나오는 거룩한 興奮이되야 讀者諸氏와한가지 合流되기를바란다.(朴)
