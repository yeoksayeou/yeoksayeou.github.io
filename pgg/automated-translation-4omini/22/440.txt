The Quirks of Artists

When artists create their works, they concentrate all their energy into their minds. This state of concentration is called inspiration. Therefore, Buffon defined inspiration as the essence extracted from patience and diligence.

Artists strive to ensure that they have no mental or physical restrictions in order to achieve this inspiration. As it gradually accumulates, if it reaches an extreme, it becomes a habit. This is what is referred to as the quirks of artists. Following are examples of noted artists and scholars with eccentricities.

Tolstoy wrote his works while wearing the shabby clothes of peasants. Originally, the clothing worn by serfs is loose, allowing for movement without any hindrance to the body.

Proust would only write novels at night while wrapped in a sleeping gown, and if he needed to write during the day, he would cover the door and light large candles on both sides of his bed while working on his novels.

Anatole France wore Western clothing typical for public wear but donned the kind of cap worn by Catholic clerics and worked with housekeeping shoes on his feet.

Rousseau went out into the fields, laid his head among the grass, and meditated, while Montesquieu, in contrast, studied his great work, "The Spirit of the Laws," in a carriage, the only means of transport at the time.

Fox would wrap his head in a white cloth soaked in vinegar before entering his study, and he would spend more than ten hours working in there.

Montagne retreated to an ancient tower in a cave to contemplate against the stone wall.

Chillib examined ideas written down on ice to compose poetry.

Maturin would furrow his brow when pondering something deeply.

Jeremy Bentham would write down whatever came to mind on a piece of paper and tie it with string.

Linnaeus, a known botanist, gathered materials in a similar manner.

Napoleon, when occupied politically, would always engage in business in his study with his secretary, while singing, playing with a sword, or acting like a mischievous child, gradually entering into meditation, and when plans were formed, he would order his secretary to write them down immediately.

Milton seldom wrote during the day, only at night, and when he meditated, he would recline comfortably in a large armchair, tilting his head back as if he were asleep and immersed in deep thought.

Leonardo da Vinci, when painting his masterpiece "The Last Supper," would sometimes forget to eat, and for days would stare at the same painting without taking his eyes off it.

Gerard Lally painted while dressed in luxurious garments, while the famous musician Salieri composed music in dark rooms.

Conversely, Sibelius could not compose unless he was in a noisy environment.

Baysal could not compose if he did not wrap himself in a blanket on his bed.

Sakini could not create music unless a cat wandered freely around him.

In similarly eccentric fashion, Chinese poets like Xue Daoheng would get angry when thinking about poetry amid the noise of men and women, while Chen Houshan would require all family members to leave the house when writing poetry.

Wang Wei would immerse himself in a large basin filled with water while composing with great difficulty.

Lao Gongji would climb to the top of a high tree to think about his essays.

  

**Summary**

This article discusses the idiosyncrasies of famous artists and scholars, illustrating how their unique habits and environments contribute to their creative processes. The behaviors described highlight the lengths to which these individuals go to cultivate inspiration, indicating the deep interplay between their creativity and personal eccentricities. This insight could intrigue historians studying colonial Korea, as it reflects how even in times of political and social turmoil, individual artists retained a strong personal identity and unique creative practices, potentially shaping the cultural landscape of Korean art during the era.
