Spring Dream  

Last night in the bridal chamber, the spring breeze arose  
For a moment on the pillow, I lingered in a fading dream  

I reminisce about a beautiful woman by the Xiang River,  
Having traversed thousands of miles across Jiangnan. <53>  

**Summary**  

This poem reflects on dreams and memories, particularly of a romantic nature, evoking a sense of nostalgia for a beautiful woman and the tranquil setting of the Xiang River in Jiangnan. The imagery captures the fleeting nature of love and dreams within a metaphorical springtime setting, a common theme in literature.
