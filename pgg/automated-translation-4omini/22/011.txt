Snow  
						Kim Gap  
In the whispering flurry, the snow falls thick, white shadows blanket the mountains.  

Thus, against the slanting wind, my clothing is fully besieged; who knows the mystical game of heaven and earth?  

Beside the stream, a lonely crane grieves in silence, while I approach the tavern woman to ask for wine.  

Near the trees, cold crows do not fly; drunkenly, I lie down and forget my return. <5>  

**Summary**  

This poem reflects on the beauty and melancholy of snowfall, illustrating scenes of nature and solitude. The imagery of the snow, the lonely crane, and the tavern woman evoke a sense of isolation. From a historical perspective, the poem can be seen as a commentary on the human condition during the colonial period in Korea, where feelings of solitude and longing were common amid social and political changes.

雪
						金笠
蕭蕭密密又霏霏 徒見江山■白影
故向斜風滿襲衣 誰知天地弄玄機
澗邊獨鶴愁無語 强近店婆因問酒
木末寒鴉凍不飛 緬然醉臥却忘歸＜5＞
