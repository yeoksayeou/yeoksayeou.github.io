忠淸道民謠  

Let us go to the grave  

Let us go to the grave, let us go to the grave  

Let us go to the dragon head of Waryong (臥龍山)  

If we bury at the dragon head of Waryong,  

For twelve or thirteen years, good fortune will be drawing in.  

- The grave (墓) refers to a burial site, and Waryongryongdu (臥龍山의 龍머리) means the dragon head of Waryong Mountain. In the area of Chungcheongdo, there is a superstition that if a grave is placed on a mountain with the character for dragon, it will attract wealth, which is why farmers sing this song.  

Let us go to the grave, let us go to the grave  

Let us go to the dragon head of Waryong  

If you plant the rice seedlings in the hottest period,  

How will we survive through the harsh winter?  

Let us go to the grave, let us go to the grave  

Let us go to the dragon head of Waryong  

What is the reason for using this grave?  

The prime minister is discussing this.  

Let us go to the grave, let us go to the grave  

Let us go to the dragon head of Waryong  

Oh prime minister, for all I care,  

What will our people eat and live on?  

Let us go to the grave, let us go to the grave  

Let us go to the dragon head of Waryong  

If the grave is placed on Waryong Mountain,  

It will cause rivers and streams across the land to flow.  

Jipsimgori  

In Chungcheongdo, the season's fruit (僧桃)  

A pair of the main offerings has ripened.  

Across the river, big jujube (大棗)  

Blooming cheerfully like a flower.  

It’s rising up, it’s rising up,  

The season’s fruit is rising up.   

Like a half-moon in the clouds,  

The season’s fruit is rising up.  

Is it the crescent moon I see?  

It's the new moon that’s a half-moon.  

Where did the wind blow from?  

The four big gates are open.  

Oh wind, oh wind, do not blow,  

For the pink skirt flutters.

忠淸道民謠
						車相瓚
묘파러가세
묘파러가세 묘파러가세
와룡룡두에 묘파러가세
와룡룡두에 묘를 쓰면
열두삼년을 감을이 지네

-묘는 墓, 와룡용두는 臥龍山의 龍머리란 뜻이니 충청도 근방에서는 龍字든 山에 묘를 쓰면 감을이 든다는 迷信이 잇는 까닭에 農民들이 이러한 노래를 부른다.

묘파러가세 묘파러가세
와룡룡두에 묘파러가세
삼복시절에 못심으면은
삼동삼춘을 어이살가.

묘파러가세 묘파러가세
와룡룡두에 묘파러가세
묘쓴 곡절은 무엇인가
정승판서가 다난단다.

묘파러가세 묘파러가세
와룡룡두에 묘파러가세
정승판서야 나더라한들＜2＞
우리백성은 무얼먹고사노

묘파러가세 묘파러가세
와룡룡두에 묘파러가세
와룡산에다 묘를 쓰면
팔도강산에 땅물이 나네

점심고리
충청도 중복상(僧桃)
주지(主持) 한 쌍 열엇네
강넘어 강대초(大棗)
앙긋방긋 열엇네

떠드러온다 떠드러온다
점심고리가 떠드러온다
구름속의 반달가티
점심고리가 떠드러온다
젯가짓게 반달인가
초생달이 반달이지

어느 곳 바람이 불엇던가
四大門이 열이엿네
바람아 바람아 부지마라
분홍치마가 휘날인다.＜3＞
＜2-3＞
