Yang Guifei of Tang Minghuang - Explanation of the Song of Everlasting Sorrow by the Poet Saint Bai Juyi
						돌이
A Yang Family Daughter Comes of Age

Emperor Hyǒnjong of the Tang Dynasty was a wise ruler who diligently managed state affairs, reforming the dilapidated and chaotic court. He suppressed rebellions by court officials, quelled disturbances outside the capital, and brought peace to the realm. With nothing to do, the ruler and his subjects indulged in dreams of pleasure.

In the forty-third year of Hyǒnjong’s reign, as he approached his later years, he began to feel weary of state affairs. Nevertheless, peace continued to reign in the capital city of Chang'an. However,憂鬱 anxiety and unrest constantly lingered in Hyǒnjong's heart. During moonlit nights, the emperor succumbed to illusions of frivolous romance, issuing decrees throughout the land to gather alluring and graceful beauties into the palace, losing himself in endless fantasies.

One day, the emperor paid a visit to the private residence of his favored minister, Yang Guozhong. As the old emperor expressed his longing heart, he suddenly discovered the beautiful Yang Guifei (楊貴妃) (Yang Guozhong’s cousin).

Oh! The beauty he had long sought in dreams and illusions was here. The emperor's heart beat like that of a young man.

"Oh! I have found love!"

It was the emperor's cry, overflowing with joy.

Yang Guifei's demeanor, nurtured in the depths of her chamber, was so radiant that even the bright sunlight seemed to lose its luster. Her sparkling pupils and plump cheeks, her mere smile eliciting a hundred charms, this peerless beauty, before whom the palace maids paled, finally came to serve the king.

The bitter winter of Chang'an vanished without a trace, and spring, a spring of joy, a spring of pleasure, flowed against the current of the Yangtze River and arrived here as well.

On an evening when fine, drizzling rain fell silently, the red and white flowers were just about to bloom, and cute birds, blessing their love, chirped incessantly by the palace windows.

"May you be young forever, oh my love!"

Overflowing with joy at having found the beautiful woman, Emperor Hyǒnjong could not help but seek the elixir of eternal life. Receiving the imperial command, Taoist priests crossed the seas to the east, passed the Great Wall to the north, and sailed the Yangtze River to the south, all in search of the elixir of immortality.

The capital city of Chang'an remained peaceful. The emperor's soul <80> was free and ecstatic. However, the world was increasingly pregnant with crisis.

Spring Cold Bestows Bath at Hwach'ǒng Pond (華淸池)

The body of pleasure has arrived! The emperor, along with Yang Guifei and three thousand palace women, went to the detached palace of Yǒsan to indulge in fantasies.

Oh! How splendid and magnificent the spectacle must have been! The charm of Yǒsan, drenched in spring rain, delighted Hyǒnjong to his very bones. On a late spring evening, his heart throbbing intimately, the emperor offered thanks to heaven for the happiness of life.

"I am the emperor!"

The emperor suppressed his throbbing blood and exclaimed in a trembling voice.

One late spring day, the emperor granted a bath to the three thousand palace women.

A late spring evening lit by red lanterns! Everything was beautiful on this spring evening! The Hwach'ǒng Pond in Yǒsan Palace was as blue and clear as crystal.

The palace women, hand in hand, entering the bathhouse in groups of three or five, their figures, both front and back, were more beautiful than paintings and more graceful than poetry.

Supported by a maid, Yang Guifei descended the steps one by one. Her snow-like skin and glossy black hair were like a fairy or a goddess. What sculptor could have carved such a sacred image before?

The water parted smoothly. The glassy hot spring water quietly received her. The droplets rolling off her shoulders were like beads or pearls.

Clear and pristine water - revealing her ruby-like skin! An endlessly gushing spring! Bright lights like knives. There was nothing there that was not poetry, nothing that was not a painting.

"Ah, I have found a dream!"

Emperor Hyǒnjong, inspecting the bathhouse, exclaimed with endless satisfaction. Indeed, for the emperor that evening, Yang Guifei was eternal beauty and infinite joy.

In the Hibiscus Tent, Warm Spring Nights Pass

Supported by her maids, Yang Guifei entered the sleeping quarters with weary steps. Wherever she walked, red and white exquisite flowers were scattered.

Her figure, adorned with rouge and green eyeshadow, was even more beautiful on top of her beauty.

Oh! One night in Yǒsan! The night, boasting of glory and drunk with fragrance, was abundant, but this night was an unforgettable and deeply affectionate night for Hyǒnjong.

The evening deepened silently. Deep inside the magnificent palace <81>, people were dismissed, and only two people, Emperor Hyǒnjong and Yang Guifei, faced each other. Endless whispers!

"Birds flying wing to wing and branches intertwined! Oh! This is my endless wish."

An evening telling thoughts to one who knows no longing – beneath warm covers, a thrilling night of enchantment was waning. The night of joy was so short that the dawn moon had already hidden its light. Now the emperor could understand the feelings of young men who lamented the shortness of spring evenings.

Emperor Hyǒnjong, praised as a wise ruler of restoration and a sage emperor of Chǒngwan (貞觀) (Hyǒnjong's reign title), became an ordinary man from this evening onward. The emperor, who used to come to the royal court early in the morning to manage state affairs, now slept in his chambers until the sun was three rods high.

All politics had departed from the emperor's interest.

Lacking interest in state affairs and aimlessly wandering in fantasies, the emperor held banquets day and night, placing beautiful women on either side of him, solely indulging in drunkenness.

Li Paek (李白) and Tu Mokji (杜牧之), the poets of the time, attended these banquets, presenting impromptu poems praising the emperor's longevity and receiving the emperor's cup of commendation.

Thus, the Tang Dynasty's capital became a pit of pleasure. However, the shadow of a terrifying demon was already casting its black hand in the northern sky. Oh! The black shadow of a terrifying demon…….

Detached Palace High, Entering the Blue Clouds

A separate palace, adorned with splendor and extravagance, was built for Yang Guifei.

The three thousand beautiful women of the harem! The favor of those three thousand was concentrated on Yang Guifei alone. Golden and jade halls! The emperor built great projects throughout the night.

However, Emperor Hyǒnjong, once highly praised as a sage ruler and wise emperor, had now become the target of the people's resentment.

"I am the emperor!"

However, this one phrase of Hyǒnjong's became the reason for all despotism. The Yang family, who gave birth to the favored concubine, indeed gained power in the court, and no one in the Yang clan failed to ascend to high office.

Spring was fully ripe.

The capital of Chang'an reached the peak of joy, and it seemed as if all the beauty on earth was gathering here. Everyone sang of peace.

However, at that time, beyond the Great Wall, black clouds were already gathering and beginning to cover the sky.

Who heard the deep thunder? Ah! A terrifying storm had risen in the north. Soon it would cross the mountains, run across the plains, and descend upon Chang'an with terrifying force.

Spring was dead, flowers were wet <82>

Already! The people of Chang'an should no longer be drunk on dreams of pleasure. A fearful demon was stretching out its black hands, trying to seize Chang'an in its grasp, drawing closer and closer with each passing moment.

However, the dreamers of the pleasure palace of Yǒsan refused to awaken from their dreams. On the high palace, red and white flags fluttered, and the sound of string and bamboo instruments incessantly bewitched the people! The demon had come to swallow Chang'an-.

The War Drums of Ǒyang Shake the Earth

An Lushan (安祿山), who concurrently held the position of three military commissioners in the northeast, heard that Emperor Hyǒnjong was indulging only in female beauty and raised troops in Ǒyang (漁陽), north of the Great Wall.

Leading hundreds of thousands of soldiers, he crossed the Great Wall and marched south across the plains of North China like a tidal wave.

"Seize Loyang!"

An Lushan himself mounted his horse, stood at the head of the formation, brandished his long sword, and spurred his horse, pointing to the southern sky.

Behold! A distant light shines in the southwest.

The flames of fierce fire brightly illuminate the dark night.

Twenty thousand brave soldiers, wielding white blades and riding swift horses, took advantage of the night to cross the breached Great Wall, gazed upon the Central Plains, and rushed in like a flood.

Oh! Already, the demon has reached the north of the Yellow River. Does its fearful hand not seek to seize Loyang and Chang'an in its grasp by sweeping across the sky?

However, the dream of Chang'an has not yet awakened. People were chasing butterfly dreams of past spring days. Only wine, only song, frivolous days continued without end.

The rebel army conquered every city they reached, spurring southwards.

They finally crossed the Yellow River.

"Crush Loyang!"

The great army rushed in like a sieve.

Indeed, it was a time of crisis and survival. At that time, loyal, brave, and righteous men rose up, forming righteous armies and defending the fortresses everywhere. However, the great army from the north was incomparably fierce. They had never failed to beat the victory drum wherever they went and finally besieged Loyang.

The pit of pleasure, the city of Loyang, was surrounded tenfold and twentyfold.

Fierce fires scorched the sky.

Ah! The day of receiving curses had arrived.

The Song of Rainbow Skirts and Feathered Robes is Shattered

In the palace of Chang'an, the banquet was still in full swing. Yang Guifei personally danced the Song of Rainbow Skirts and Feathered Robes for the emperor. Soft and gentle body! Clear and distinct voice! In the place where the light silk clothes fluttered lightly, the ruler and his subjects were all entranced.

Oh! Who could have known in advance that this dance, Yang Guifei's Song of Rainbow Skirts and Feathered Robes, would be the pinnacle of the pleasure of Yǒsan Palace?

"Your Majesty, a great disaster has occurred!"

This flustered and urgent cry shattered their dreams.

"The world is in great turmoil! Unrest has broken out everywhere, and the enemy has entered Chang'an <83>!"

"What! Enemy soldiers……?"

People stared in stunned silence, mouths agape.

The realm of joy suddenly became a scene of carnage. The emperor raised a trembling hand and opened the window.

The sky! Was dark and starless, and in the distance, only the flames of war could be seen scorching the sky…….

"Oh! Chang'an is engulfed in war!"

The old emperor bit his lip and stood silently.

"Your Majesty! There is nothing else to be done; leave Chang'an and escape the disaster!"

As if in a dream, the emperor left Chang'an.

"Oh! Chang'an!"

The old emperor cried out several times, gazing at the imperial capital engulfed in flames.

Smoke and dust rose from the ninefold city gates, and thousands of chariots and tens of thousands of riders silently headed southwest. About a hundred li from the West Capital Gate, the emperor's guards stopped their advance.

"Kill the seductive woman! Kill Yang Guifei!"

The shouts of the soldiers were loud.

"Your Majesty! Atonement to the world with Yang Guifei's life! This is the only way to save the nation!"

"Silence! Yang Guifei is mine!"

The emperor dismissed the soldiers' loyalty with these words.

The Graceful Eyebrows Wither Before the Horse

However, the emperor's emotions could not overcome the soldiers' reason. The emperor, who had lost his way in the proper course by indulging in female beauty, was destined to submit.

"Kill the seductive woman!"

The soldiers' cries did not cease.

"Life or death! Take death!"

A white blade bloomed on the chest of the beautiful Yang Guifei.

"Oh! Guifei! Guifei!"

Even with the emperor's power, this fate could not be averted.

"Guifei! Guifei!"

The old emperor covered his face, unable to save her, and the withering beauty poured out unseasonable red leaves before the emperor's horse.

"Guifei! I did not intend to kill you here!"

Tears of blood merged and flowed down the emperor's cheeks. However, a shout of joy rose up at once.

"Guifei is dead!"

"Long live Your Majesty!"

Tens of thousands of troops moved again!

"Repel the enemy!"

"Save Chang'an!"

The soldiers' morale blazed. The ultimate loyalty surged like a tide with "Long live Your Majesty!"

However, surrounded by the shouts of "Long live Your Majesty," the old emperor stood silently.

"Guifei! I may preserve the nation. I may preserve Chang'an. But I have lost my dream. I have lost the emperor. I have lost all light!"

Emperor Hyǒnjong silently bowed his head and swayed on his horse. <84>

『陛下여! 할 일업사오니 長安을납서 難을 避하소서!』
皇帝는 듯 長安을낫다.
『오! 長安이여!』
老帝는 猛火에싸인 帝都를바라보며 몃차레나외엿다.
九重의 城闕에는 烟塵이니러나고 千乘萬騎는 肅肅히 西南으로 向하여갓다 西都門을나선지 百餘里에 皇帝의 衛兵은 進軍을끄첫다.
『妖婦를죽여라! 楊貴妃를죽여라』
將士들의부르지즘은놉핫다.
『陛下여! 楊貴妃의목슴으로 天下에 謝罪를하소서! 國家를 救援하는길은 이밧게업사이다』
『말을말러라! 楊貴妃는나의것이다』
皇帝는 將士들의 忠信을 이한마듸로 물리첫다.
宛轉蛾眉馬前死
그러나 皇帝의 感情은 將士들의 理性을니길수가업섯다 女色에 沈溺하야 常道를일흔 皇帝는 當然히 服從하지아니하면아니될 運命은왓다.

『貴妃! 貴妃!』
老帝는 얼골을가릴뿐 救할길이업섯고 宛轉하는 美花는 때안인 丹楓을드리우고 虛되히 帝의 馬前에업푸러젓다.
『貴妃! 朕은 그대를 여기서죽이려고는아니하엿섯다!』
血淚는 合하야 皇帝의 兩顂을흐럿다 그러나 歡呼의소리는 一時에니러낫다
『貴妃는 죽엇다!』
『陛下萬歲!』
數萬의 軍은 다시움즉이엿다!
『敵을물리처라!』
『長安을 救하여라!』
將士의 義氣는타올랏다 忠烈의 至情은 陛下萬歲로 潮水가티 어올럿다
그러나 老帝는 陛下萬歲소리에싸여서 悄然히서잇섯다.
『貴妃여! 朕은 國家를 保存할지는모른다 長安을 保存할지는모른다 그러나 朕은 을일헛다 皇帝를일헛다 모-든 光明을일헛다!』
玄宗皇帝는 黙黙히머리를숙이고 馬上에흔들렷다.＜84＞
＜80-84＞
