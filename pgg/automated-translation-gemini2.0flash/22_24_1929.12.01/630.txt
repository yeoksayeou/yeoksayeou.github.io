The Significance of Lifting the Gold Embargo
						Sŏ Ch'un

1. Gold Export Prohibition

The term "lifting the gold embargo" is an abbreviation of "lifting the gold export prohibition order." Therefore, the explanation of the gold embargo issue should begin with an explanation of the fact of the gold export prohibition.

In Japan, the Gold Export Requiring Permission Order was promulgated as Ministry of Finance Ordinance No. 28 on September 12, Taishō 6 (1917), and was implemented on the same day. In Chosŏn, the Gold Export Requiring Permission Order was promulgated as Chosŏn Governor-General Order No. 265 on September 14 of the same year and was also implemented on the same day.

2. Significance of the Gold Export Requiring Permission Order

First, regarding the contents of the Japanese Ministry of Finance Ordinance, it consists of three articles in the main text and supplementary provisions.

The content of the first article states, "Those who intend to export gold coins or gold bullion abroad must obtain permission from the Minister of Finance," and it includes a proviso stating, "However, in the case of those traveling abroad carrying less than 100 yen in gold coins, permission is not required."

The content of the second article states, "If anyone is found secretly exporting gold coins or bullion without the permission of the Minister of Finance in violation of the preceding article, i.e., the first article, they will be subject to imprisonment for up to three months or a fine of up to 100 yen."

The content of the third article states, "The crime of those who are found collecting gold coins (coins made of gold), melting them down, or damaging them for the purpose of selling them as bullion or using them as bullion is also the same as the crime of those who are found exporting gold coins or gold bullion (gold that is not made into money), and they will be subject to imprisonment for up to three months or a fine of up to 100 yen." <148>

The content of the supplementary provisions states, "This order will be implemented from the date of promulgation, September 12, Taishō 6."

The above is an interpretation of the contents of the Japanese Ministry of Finance Ordinance without being bound by the legal text. Looking at this, the export of gold coins or gold bullion requires "permission." That is, it is okay to export with permission, but exporting without permission will result in such and such a crime. That is, it only says that permission is required for the export of gold, but it does not say that the export of gold is absolutely prohibited. However, in reality, permission is not being granted. Therefore, this is not called the Gold Export Requiring Permission Order, but usually the Gold Export Prohibition Order.

Moreover, the Chosŏn Gold Export Prohibition Order was enacted following Japan's lead, and its wording and content are almost exactly the same, so it would not be wrong to say.

3. Purpose of the Gold Export Prohibition

As you can see from the contents of the aforementioned Gold Export Prohibition Order, its purpose is to prevent gold coins and gold bullion from flowing out of the country. Furthermore, as you can see from the prohibition of the collection, melting, or damaging of gold coins mentioned in Article 3 of the Prohibition Order, protecting gold coins within the country is also an additional purpose of this. Then, for what reason is it necessary to protect gold coins and gold bullion from flowing out of the country? To know this reason, it is necessary to briefly understand the Japanese monetary system first.

4. Japanese Monetary System

Currency is, in simple terms, "money." "Money" stipulated by the Japanese Currency Act (Law No. 16 of March 29, Meiji 30 [1897]) consists of four types and nine kinds.

Gold Coins = 20 yen, 10 yen, 5 yen
Silver Coins = 50 sen, 20 sen
Nickel Coins = 10 sen, 5 sen
Bronze Coins = 1 sen, 5 rin
(See Article 3 of the Currency Act above)

Among these four types and nine kinds, the only "real money" that can be used without limit in the country and can be used at face value abroad is one type and three kinds of gold coins. The other three types and six kinds, such as silver coins, nickel, bronze, etc., are so-called subsidiary currencies that can be used within the country only within certain limits. That is, according to Article 7 of the Currency Act, "Gold coins are legal tender without limit to their amount. Silver coins are legal tender up to 10 yen, nickel coins up to 5 yen, and bronze coins up to 1 yen." From this, you can see that silver coins are legal tender without limit, and the other three types are legal tender only within a certain amount limit. Therefore, even if you give 1,000 yen, 10,000 yen, or even tens of billions of yen in gold coins, you cannot refuse to accept them because they are heavy, but if someone gives more than 1 yen and 1 sen in bronze coins, more than 5 yen and 5 sen in nickel coins, or more than 10 yen and 10 sen in silver coins, they have the right to request that they be exchanged for other types of money. <149>

Since real money is only one type of gold coin, gold coins account for the majority of money in Japan. If the total amount of money in Japan is 1.4 billion yen, more than 1 billion yen of that is gold coins.

Furthermore, if we delve deeper into Article 7 of the Gold Currency Act, it is as follows: 1 yen or more in bronze coins can be exchanged for nickel coins, silver coins, gold coins, etc., 5 yen or more in nickel coins can be exchanged for silver coins and gold coins, and 10 yen or more in silver coins can be exchanged for gold coins. Therefore, in the end, we can see that the three types of silver, nickel, and bronze are subsidiary currencies used as substitutes for silver coins within a certain small amount, and are not real money. Furthermore, a 5-yen silver coin contains the weight of pure gold worth exactly 5 yen at market price, but the other three types do not have a value equivalent to their face value. For example, a 50-sen silver coin does not contain the amount of silver worth 50 sen at market price, but only about 30 or 40 sen worth. Therefore, even from this perspective, the three types of silver coins, nickel coins, and bronze coins are not real money. Therefore, they cannot be used abroad.

5. Bank of Japan Convertible Notes

As mentioned earlier, gold coins are the only real money, and gold coins account for the largest amount of money in Japan. However, why is it that we cannot see so many gold coins circulating? It is not for any other reason: (1) There is concern that such valuable items might be lost or damaged if they are circulated carelessly, and (2) No matter how small the denomination, objects of great value are heavy and inconvenient for large transactions. According to the Japanese Currency Act, "The unit of price is based on the amount of 2 bu of pure gold, and this is called yen." According to this, 1 yen is 2 bu of pure gold, 5 yen is 1 monme, and 500,000 yen is 100 kan in weight, which is a weight that even a strong person cannot lift. Due to such inconveniences, gold coins and gold bullion are collected and stored in the Bank of Japan's vault, and paper money called Bank of Japan Convertible Notes is issued to the world instead. The Japanese paper money we usually see is that. Bank of Japan Convertible Notes are issued as substitutes for gold coins, so it is written on the surface of the paper money that it can be exchanged for gold coins. However, seeing that the paper money is circulating so much, we can see that gold coins, which are real money, account for the majority of the money. In addition, Japan has so-called small denomination paper money issued by the government, such as 50-sen, 20-sen, and 10-sen notes. However, these are also ultimately exchangeable for gold coins. Therefore, both small denomination paper money issued by the government and Bank of Japan Convertible Notes are a type of bill with the characteristic of being a substitute for gold and are only used domestically on the premise that they can be exchanged for gold coins of the same face value, and are completely unusable abroad.

Therefore, paper money alone, regardless of whether it is small denomination paper money issued by the government or Bank of Japan Convertible Notes, is an object similar to waste paper that cannot be used abroad at all. <150>

6. International Balance of Payments and Gold Coins

As mentioned above, gold coins are the only currency that can be used in international transactions, so those who have debts to foreign countries due to import trade or those who intend to travel abroad must pay their debts with gold coins and go abroad with gold coins. What do they do then? They take Bank of Japan Convertible Notes worth 10,000 yen if it is 10,000 yen, or 100,000 yen if it is 100,000 yen, to the Bank of Japan and ask for them to be exchanged. The Bank of Japan exchanges them according to the promise written on the convertible notes. Then, they bring the gold coins and either send them to the foreign creditor or take them abroad. In this way, the settlement of debts and credits in international transactions is generally done with gold coins. Therefore, if imports are greater than exports in trade, resulting in an excess of imports, more gold flows out of the country than flows in, and ultimately, a portion of the gold cannot avoid flowing out. Thus, in all cases, if there are more payments than receipts to foreign countries, the country's gold flows out to foreign countries, and conversely, if there are more receipts than payments, gold flows into the country from foreign countries.

7. Gold Inflow/Outflow and Currency Expansion/Contraction

Those who intend to send gold abroad take money called Bank of Japan Convertible Notes to the Bank of Japan and exchange them for gold coins or gold bullion and send them abroad. However, since the convertible notes have been acting as money as a substitute for gold, after the gold runs away to foreign countries, it cannot come out into the world to act as money again. Therefore, when gold flows out to foreign countries, the amount of money circulating in the world decreases as much as the outflow. That is, the currency (in simple terms, money) contracts. Conversely, those who export goods to foreign countries and receive gold from foreign countries as payment take the gold to the Bank of Japan, where it is exchanged for Bank of Japan Convertible Notes at a rate of 5 yen per monme. At the same time, the Bank of Japan Convertible Notes circulating in the world increase by the amount that person exchanged for gold. That is, the currency expands. Therefore, when gold flows in from foreign countries, the currency expands.

8. Par Value

Countries that use gold as real money, like Japan, are called gold standard countries, and countries that use silver as real money, like India and China, are called silver standard countries. However, among the leading countries in the world, with the exception of India and China, all are gold standard countries. However, even though they are all gold standard countries, the unit price names of gold coins are different. For example, Japan uses 2 bu of pure gold as the unit price and calls this "yen," the United States uses 4 bu of pure gold as the unit price and calls this "dollar," and the United Kingdom uses about 2 monme of pure gold as the unit price and calls this "pound." Here, in order to establish a standard for settling international debts and credits, the question arises of how much a certain amount of Japanese money is when calculated in US dollars or British pounds. According to the results of comparing for this purpose, <151>

100 Japanese gold yen is equivalent to 49 and 7/8 US dollars, and 1 Japanese yen is equivalent to 9/16 of 2 shillings in British currency, and this is called the "par value" between each country. Of course, there will be such par values between Japan and other gold standard countries as well.

9. International Balance of Payments Exchange Settlement Method

Looking at the debt and credit relationship between each country, there are things to give and things to receive. Taking the relationship between Japan and the United States as an example for the time being, Japanese raw silk exporters have claims against the United States, and Japanese cotton importers have debts to the United States. However, if the former exports raw silk worth 100 Japanese yen and the latter imports cotton worth 49 and 7/8 US dollars, then 100 yen is equal to 49 and 7/8 US dollars (par value), so the claims and debts between the countries can be offset without transporting or importing gold coins. Even if there are cases where one country's debts are greater than the other country's debts, they can be offset up to the same amount. Only the excess portion needs to be transported from the debtor country to the creditor country in gold. In such cases, the convenient method that arises to offset the debts and credits between the two countries is the bill of exchange settlement method.

10. Method of Bill of Exchange Settlement

For example, let's say that Japanese A has a debt of 49 and 7/8 US dollars to American B, and Japanese Ŭl has a debt of the same amount to American A. In such a case, instead of individually transporting and importing gold, what should be done to use the bill of exchange settlement method?

Japanese A draws a bill of exchange with a face value of 49 and 7/8 US dollars to his debtor, B. Ŭl buys the bill of exchange for 100 yen. He buys it and sends it to his creditor, American A. A receives this bill of exchange and either goes directly to B to receive payment or discounts it at his bank. However, in the case of discounting it at the bank, the bank goes to B on the due date to receive payment. That is, with the issuance of one bill of exchange, the debts and credits between the two countries are offset without importing gold.

11. Reason for International Settlement Method

In international debts and credits, exchange is used as much as possible to settle without transporting gold. The reason for this is not only that it is expensive to transport and import gold individually, but also that costs are incurred in the transfer of gold. That is, to transport 100 Japanese gold yen to the United States, the total cost of packaging, freight, insurance, and interest during the transportation period is about 1 US dollar, i.e., 1 yen. Therefore, in order to save this cost, the actual transfer of gold is avoided as much as possible, and the bill of exchange settlement method is used.

12. Rise and Fall of Foreign Exchange <152>

《Attention = Here is something special to note. From now on, when we say "yen," we are not referring to the gold coins that are the basis of the Japanese yen, but ultimately to the Bank of Japan Convertible Notes (paper money) that can be exchanged for gold coins. Similarly, special attention should be paid to the fact that when we say "dollar" or "pound," we are referring to the paper money of each country. Why? Because gold, which is the basis of each country's paper money, does not rise or fall in price because it is the standard of price itself.》.

Those who have claims against foreign countries will ultimately have to exchange the foreign currency they receive for their own country's currency. Conversely, those who have debts to foreign countries will ultimately have to pay their creditors in that foreign currency. Taking the relationship between Japan and the United States as an example, in the case of having claims against Americans, even if you receive payment in dollars, you will ultimately have to receive it in yen. Conversely, those who have debts to the United States will ultimately have to exchange yen for dollars to pay it. Because what people in each country ultimately demand is their own country's "money." In this case, the example of directly exchanging gold coins is as described in item "7. Gold Inflow/Outflow and Currency Expansion/Contraction" above.

In the case of settling international debts and credits through the exchange of foreign exchange, what does "exchange" mean? Ultimately, for example, those who have claims against the United States are sellers of dollars, i.e., sellers of dollars. Conversely, those who have debts to the United States are buyers of dollars, i.e., buyers of dollars. In the example in "10. Method of Bill of Exchange Settlement" above, A, a creditor to Americans, is a seller of dollar exchange, and Ŭl, a debtor to Americans, is a buyer of dollar exchange. Therefore, in foreign exchange settlement, "all creditors to foreign countries are sellers of foreign currency, and conversely, all debtors to foreign countries are buyers of foreign currency."

Therefore, foreign exchange is ultimately bought and sold like ordinary stores, and rises and falls according to the law of supply and demand.

13. Principles of Rise and Fall

The foreign exchange market rises and falls according to the law of supply and demand. Now, let's take a practical example. In the trade relationship between Japan and the United States, let's say that imports from the United States are greater than exports to the United States from Japan's perspective. As a result, the amount of imports, i.e., the amount of buying yen, is greater than the amount of exports, i.e., the amount of selling dollars. Therefore, according to the law of supply and demand, the demand for dollars becomes greater than the supply of dollars, so ultimately the value of the dollar rises. That is, in practice, 100 yen is originally equal to 49 and 7/8 dollars, so it should be bought and sold based on this standard, but in this case, the dollar rises, and it goes up to 49 and 6/8, 8/5, or 8/4 dollars per 100 yen. If 100 yen is 49 and 6/8 dollars, it means that the dollar has risen more than 49 and 7/8 dollars per 100 yen, and conversely, the value of the yen has fallen by that much. (It is like when 1 yen used to buy 4 shō of rice, but now 1 yen buys 3 shō of rice, the price of rice rises, and the value of money falls.

14. Limits of Rise and Fall

(First of all, it should be said that in gold standard countries, where gold is used as real money, the export of gold is free. This may have already been understood from the above, but it is worth noting here again).

However, under the gold export freedom system, there is a limit to the rise and fall of the foreign exchange market. Taking the relationship between Japan and the United States as an example, the fundamental reason for not actually sending gold individually in settling debts and credits between the two countries, but rather buying and selling dollars through exchange settlement, is to save the actual shipping costs of packaging, freight, insurance, and interest during the shipping period. When each country's currency falls below the price that deducts the actual shipping costs from the par value, then they do not use the foreign exchange settlement method and actually send gold. For example, if it costs 100 yen to actually send 100 Japanese gold yen to the United States, and the Japanese yen falls to 49 and 3/8 dollars or less, Japanese debtors with debts to the United States will lose money if they buy and send dollars through foreign exchange compared to actually sending gold. Therefore, in such cases, more people will actually send gold without using the exchange settlement method. Therefore, under the gold export freedom system, the Japanese yen will not fall below 49 and 3/8 dollars, which is the difference between the par value of 49 and 7/8 dollars and half a dollar, which is the actual shipping cost. Conversely, if the Japanese yen rises above the par value plus the actual shipping cost, i.e., (49/6/4+7/8) 59 and 3/8 dollars, then the US debt to Japan will be a loss to use the exchange settlement method, so they will stop using this method and directly send gold to Japan to settle. That is, from Japan's perspective, if the exchange market rises this much, then gold will flow in from then on, and the yen will not rise further. That is, under the gold export freedom system, the foreign exchange market cannot rise above the par value plus the actual shipping cost. Therefore,

That is, in the gold export freedom restriction, foreign exchange rises and falls around the par value, but it cannot rise above the highest gold inflow point and cannot fall below the lowest gold sending point.

15. Reasons for Gold Export Prohibition

During World War I, the warring countries of Europe prohibited the export of gold, so the United States prohibited it, and since the United States prohibited it, Japan had no choice but to prohibit it as well.

(1) Reasons for Prohibition by Warring Countries <154>

As the war continued, imports of military supplies, food, etc., increased, so the excess of imports over exports in foreign trade increased sharply. Therefore, if the export of gold were free, there would be a great outflow of gold, and ultimately there was concern that all the gold in the country would flow out. Also, even in the case where they were forced to export gold, it was necessary to export it under state control.

(2) Reasons for Prohibition by the United States

At the time, the United States had a thriving export trade and had more to receive from foreign countries than to give, so there was no concern about gold flowing out. However, since almost all of the debtor countries to the United States prohibited the export of gold, they could not receive what they were supposed to receive in gold, and the United States was in a position where it had to pay only what it had to give to foreign countries in gold. In addition, they also joined the war, so they declared a prohibition while joining the Allied side.

(3) Reasons for Prohibition by Japan

At the time, Japan was in a situation where gold was flowing in from the United States and gold was flowing out to East Asian countries, so when the path of gold imports was cut off due to the United States' prohibition, they had no choice but to prevent outflows as well.

(4) Reasons for Prohibition by Chosŏn and Taiwan

This was to completely achieve Japan's purpose of preventing the outflow of gold.

16. Impact of Total Export Prohibition

(1) Plunge in Exchange Rates: If there are more things to receive from foreign countries than to give in terms of the international balance of payments, there is no reason for the value of the Japanese yen (foreign exchange market) to fall, even if the export of gold is prohibited. However, Japan is not in that situation, and because there is an excess of imports of 300 to 400 million yen every year, Japan's excess of receipts in the balance of payments outside of trade offsets about 150 million yen every year, but is still in a state of excess payments of more than 200 million yen. Since the export of gold is prohibited, the Japanese yen is ultimately seen as unreliable by foreigners, so it cannot help but fall.

(2) Frequent Fluctuations in Exchange Rate Market

(3) Great Blow to Exporters

Frequent fluctuations in the foreign exchange market are like having a ruler that stretches and shrinks, so exporters and importers cannot do business with peace of mind. This is because the calculations do not match as predicted.

(4) Rise in Prices

Money and prices are in an inverse relationship, so they rise and fall. Among these, the decline in the exchange rate and its frequency are the primary impacts of the gold export prohibition.

17. Impact of Lifting the Gold Embargo <155>

What will happen if the prohibition order is lifted? The Japanese yen market is currently in a state where it has fallen far below par value because of the prohibition. However, if the embargo is lifted, it will recover to at least the actual shipping cost of bullion immediately. For example, if it is currently 48 dollars per 100 yen, it will recover to 49 and 3/8 dollars as soon as the embargo is lifted. Therefore,

(1) Prices Fall, Starting with Exports and Imports
(2) Commerce and Industry Stagnate Due to Price Falls
(3) Unemployment Increases
(4) General Public's Imports Decrease
(5) There is Concern That Gold Outflow Will Reach a Huge Amount

18. Necessity of Lifting the Embargo

Then, why are they trying to carry out such a dangerous and disadvantageous lifting of the gold embargo? There are not a few people who oppose it so much. The fact that they have not been able to carry it out for over ten years is also because they are concerned about this. However, in international trade, the state of gold export prohibition is abnormal, and the gold export freedom system is normal. However, if others have returned to normal and you are alone in an abnormal state, the one in the abnormal state always suffers losses. For example, the fact that the Japanese yen market is always lower than the currency market of normal countries is already a loss. Furthermore, with that, they cannot run commerce and industry with peace of mind. Therefore, they must endure temporary difficulties and return to normal, and under the difficulties of that normal state, they must open up the situation even while enduring temporary pain.

Postscript, Because I tried to shorten what was originally complex and difficult to understand, there are ultimately many incomplete points. I ask for the readers' understanding. <156>

金解禁의 意義
						徐椿
一, 金輸出禁止
金解禁은 金輸出禁止令을 解除한다는말을 省略한 術語이다. 故로 金解禁問題의 解說은 金輸出禁止의 事實을 說明하는데로부터 始作해야하될것이다.
日本서는 大正六年九月十二日에 大藏省令第二十八號로써 金輸出要許可令을 發布하야 當日로 施行되엿고 朝鮮서는 同年同月十四日 朝鮮總督府第二六五號로써 金輸出要許可令을 發布하야 亦是當日로 施行되엿다.
二, 金輸出要許可令의 意義
몬저 日本의 大藏省令의 內容을말하면 本文三項과 附則으로 構成되엿는데
第一項의 內容으로는『金貨幣又는 金地金을 國外로 輸出하려는 者는 大藏大臣의 許可를바더야된다』는뜻을말하고 끄트로『但, 外國에施行하는 者로 金貨幣百圓未滿을 携帶하는 境遇에는 許可를밧지안어도 關係치안타』는뜻을 但書로써부치어노은것이다.
第二項의 內容으로는『前項卽第一項의 規定에 違反하야 大藏大臣의 許可가업시 남모르게 金貨幣又는 地金을 輸出하다가 發覺이되는날이면 그런사람은 三個月以下의 懲役又는 百圓以下의 罰金에 處한다』는뜻을 말한것이다.
第三項의 內容으로는『地金으로 販賣하거나 는 地金으로 使用할 目的을가지고 金貨幣(금으로만든돈)를 蒐集(모으는것), 鑄潰(돈을녹이어서 地金으로만든것) 又는 毁傷하다가 發覺된 者의 罪 도한 金貨幣又는 金地金(돈으로만들지안코그냥잇는金)을 輸出하다가 發覺된 者의 罪와마치한가지로 三個月以下의 懲役又는 百圓以下의 罰金에 處한다는＜148＞뜻을 말한것이다.
附則의 內容으로는『本令은 發布日大正六年九月十二日부터 施行한다는뜻을 말한것이다.
以上은 日本大藏令의 內容을 法文에 拘泥치아니하고 解釋해온것인데 이것을보면 金貨幣又는 金地金의 輸出에는『許可』를바더야된다. 卽許可를바더가지고 輸出하면 關係치안으나 許可를밧지안코 輸出하다가는 이러이러한 罪를진다. 卽金의 輸出에는許可를 要한다고만햇지 金의 輸出을 아조 禁止한다고말하지는안엇다. 그러나 事實에잇서서는 許可를아니하고잇다. 故로 此를 金輸出要許可令이라고안코 普通金輸出要許可令이라고한다.
그러고 朝鮮의 金輸出禁止令은 日本에라서된 것으로 그 文句와 內容이 거의꼭가트다고하면 틀님이업다.
三, 金輸出禁止의 目的
前記金輸出禁止令의 內容을보면 알것과가티 金貨幣와 金地金이 國外로 流出하는것을 防止하자는것이그 目的이다. 다음 禁止令第三項에씨운 金貨幣의 蒐集, 鑄潰又는 毁傷을 禁한것을보아알것과가티 國內에잇서서도 金貨幣를 擁護하자는것도 한 此에 附隨한 目的이다. 그러면 金貨幣와 金地金은 무슨 理由로 國外로 流出하지안토록 保護할 必要가잇느냐? 이 理由를알녀면 몬저 日本의 貨幣制度를 暫間大綱알어둘 必要가잇다.
四, 日本의 貨幣制度
貨幣는 卽알기쉽게말하면『돈』이라는말이다. 日本의 貨幣法(明治三十年三月二十九日法律第十六號)으로 規定된『돈』은 四種類九種이잇다.
金貨幣=二十圓, 十圓, 五圓
銀貨幣=五十錢, 二十錢
白銅貨幣=十錢, 五錢
靑銅貨幣=一錢, 五厘
(以上貨幣法第三條參照)
此四種類九種中에서 첫재 國內에서도 無制限으로 通用되고 둘제 外國에가서도 實價로 通用될수잇는『정말돈』은 金貨幣一種類三種이오 其外銀貨, 白銅靑, 銅等三種類六種은다 一定한 制限內에서 國內에서 通用할수잇는 所謂補助貨라는것이다. 卽貨幣法第七條를보면『金貨幣는 그 額에 制限이업시 法貨로 通用한다 銀貨幣는 十圓지, 白銅貨幣는 五圓지, 靑銅貨幣는一圓지를 限하야 法貨로 通用한다.』이것을보면 銀貨幣는 無制限으로 通用되고 그 他三種類는 다 一定한 額의 制限內에서 法貨로 通用되는것임을알것이다. 故로 金貨는 千圓萬圓으로 乃至 幾十億圓을주어도 무겁다고안바들수가업스나 靑銅貨로一圓一錢以上, 白銅貨로五圓五錢以上, 銀貨로 十圓十錢以上을주는사람이잇다하면 다른種類의돈으로 박구어달＜149＞나고 請할 權利가잇는것이다.
何如間정말돈은 金貨幣一種類뿐인 故로 日本의돈가운데는 金貨가 大部分을 占頭한다 日本의돈의 總額을 十四億圓이라하면 그中十億圓以上은 金貨幣이다.
그러고 金貨法第七條를 窮極히 追求해보면이러하다 靑銅貨一圓以上은 白銅貨, 銀貨, 金貨等과밧굴수잇고 白銅貨五圓以上은 銀貨金貨와밧굴수잇고 銀貨十圓以上은 金貨와밧굴수가잇는것이니 決局銀, 白銅, 靑銅의 三種類는 一定한 少額에 限하야 銀貨대신으로씨우는 補助貨이지 정말돈이아닌것을알수가잇다. 그뿐아니라 銀貨는 五圓짜리면 그안에꼭 純金時價五圓의 重量을 引合하엿스나 그 他三種類는다 그 額面價格에 相當한 價値를가지지못하엿다 例하면 五十錢銀貨자리 銀貨는 그안에 時價五十錢의 銀의 分量을 包含치못하고 約三四十錢어치밧게못된다. 故로이방면으로보아도 銀貨, 白銅貨, 靑銅貨의 三種類는 정말돈이아니다. 故로 外國에가서는 못씨운다.
五, 日本銀行兌換券
金貨만이정말돈이요 한 日本의돈가운데 金貨의 額數가 第一만타는말은 旣述한바와가트다. 그러나 그러케만흔 金貨를 우리가나도는것을 볼수가업는것은 웬일이냐? 그것은 다른닭이아니다.(一) 그러케 貴한것을 함부로 내돌니다가 紛失或은 損傷할 念慮가잇고,(二)아모리적은분수로는 갑이만흔 物件이라도 多額去來에는 무거워서 不便하다 日本의 貨幣法에 依하면『純金의 量目二分으로써 價格의 單位호하야 此를 圓이라 稱함』此에 依하면 純金二分의 一圓 五圓이면 一匁, 五十萬圓이면 百貫重量이라 발서한사람가지고는 들수도업는무게이다. 大槪이러한 不便이잇는 故로 金貨와 金地金은 日本銀行金庫內에다 모아서 藏置하고 그대신으로 世上에내여보낸 조희(紙)돈이 卽日本銀行兌換券이라는것이다. 우리가 普通보는 日本紙錢이 卽그것이다. 日本銀行兌換券은 金貨代身으로 내보낸것인 故로 그 紙錢의 表面을 보면 金貨와 兌換(밧구는것)해준다고쓴것이다. 그런데 그紙錢이만히 도라단니는것을보면 돈가온데는 정말돈인 金貨가 大部分을 占領하는것을알수가잇다. 그 他日本에는 所謂政府發行의 少額紙幣 卽五十錢짜리, 二十錢짜리, 十錢짜리, 等이잇다. 그러나 이것들도 決局은 다金貨와밧굴수잇는것이다. 故로 政府發行의 少額紙幣와 日本銀行兌換券의 兩者는 다 金대신으로나도는 一種어음(手形)의 性質을가진 것으로 額面과 同額의 金貨와 밧구어준다는 미테서 國內에서만 通用되는것이오 外國에가서는 도모지씨우지못하는 物件이다.
故로 紙幣그것만은 政府發行의 少額紙幣나 日本銀行兌換券이나를 勿論하고 外國에가서는 도모지씨우지못하는 休紙同樣의 物件이다.＜150＞
六, 國際貸借의 決濟와 金貨
上記와가티 金貨만이 國際間에씨울수잇는 通貨인 故로 貿易의 輸入으로 因하야 外國에 債務를가진 者나 는 外國으로 旅行을하려는 者는 金貨를가지고 그 債務를무러주어야하며 金貨를가지고 外國으로가야된다. 그때에엇더케하느냐하면 日本銀行兌換券으로 萬圓이면 萬圓, 十萬圓이면 十萬圓을가지고 日本銀行으로가서 밧구어달라고 請한다. 日本銀行은 그 兌換券에씨운 約束에 依하야 밧구어준다. 그러면 그 金貨를가지고와서 或은 外國債權者한테보내주고 或은그것을가지고 外國으로간다. 이와가티 國際間에이러나는 貸借의 決濟卽債權債務의 決濟에는 總히 金貨로주고밧는것이다. 故로 貿易에 輸出보다 輸入이만하서 輸入超過가되면 그나라에는 金이드러오는것보다 나가는것이만하서 決局金의 一部分이 流出함을 免치못하는것이다. 如斯히 모든 境遇에 外國에 對하야 受取할것보다 支拂할것이만흐면 그나라 金은 外國로 流出하고 이와 反對로 支拂할것보다 受取할것이만흐면 外國으로부터 그나라에 金이 流入하는것이다.
七, 金流出入과 通貨의 伸縮
金을 外國으로보내려는 者는 日本銀行兌換券이라는돈을 日本銀行으로가지고가서 金貨又는 金地金과밧구어서 外國으로보내고만다. 그런데 兌換券은 金代身으로돈노릇을하여왓는 故로 그 金이 外國으로다라난뒤로는 다시돈노릇을하려 世上에나오지못한다. 故로 金이 外國으로 流出하면 流出하는이마치 世間에나도는돈이적어진다. 卽通貨(알기쉽게말하면돈이다)가 收縮된다. 이와 反對로 外國에 物件을 輸出하고 그 代價로 外國에 金을바더드린사람은 그 金을 日本銀行으로가지고가면 一匁에 五圓식처서 日本銀行兌換券으로밧구어준다. 同時에 世間에나도는 日本銀行兌換券은 그사람이 金과밧구어낸 額數만치 增加한다. 卽通貨가 膨脹한다. 故로 外國으로부터 金이 流入하면 通貨는 膨脹하는것이다.
八, 平價
日本과가티 金을정말돈으로쓰는나라를 金本位國이라고하고 印度, 中國과가티 銀을정말돈으로쓰는나라를 銀本位國이라고한다. 그런데 世界에 有數한나라 中에 印度, 中國을내여노코는 다 金本位國이다 그러나 다가티 金本位國이면서도 金貨幣의 單價名稱은 서로다르다 例하면 日本은 純金二分單價로하야 此를『圓』이라 稱하고 米國은 純金四分을 單價로하야 此를『弗』이라 稱하고 英國은 純金約二匁를 單價로하야 此를『磅』이라고한다. 여긔서 國際間의 貸借決濟에 標準을 定하기 爲하야 日本돈 一定額이 米國돈으로 計算하면얼마며 英國돈으로 計算하면 얼마냐하＜151＞는 問題가생긴다 이런 目的으로 比較해본 結果에 依하면
日本金貨百圓은 米貨四十九弗八分之七에 相當하고 日本圓貨一圓은 英貨二志○片十六分의 九에 相當한데 이것을 各兩國間의『平價』라고한다. 日本과 그他金本位國間에도 다이러한 平價가잇슬것은 勿論이다.
九, 國際貸借의 爲替決濟法
各兩國間의 貸借關係를보면 물것도잇고 줄것도잇게된다. 暫間日米兩國間을 例로드러보면 日本의 生絲輸出商은 米國에 對하야 債權를가지게되고 日本의 棉花輸入商은 米國에 對하야 債務를가지게된다. 그런데이때 萬若 前者는 日本圓貨百圓엇치 生絲를 輸出하고 後者는 米國貨四十九弗八分之七엇치 棉花를 輸入하엿다고하면 圓貨百圓은 卽弗貨四十九弗八分之七과가트니 (平價)相國間의 債權債務를 金貨의 輸送輸入이업시 相殺할수가잇다. 設使一方國의 債務가 他一方國의 債務보다 만흔 境遇가잇다고할지라도 同額지는 相殺할수가잇다. 그러고더 超過하는 分만을 債務國으로부터 債權國으로 金으로 輸送하면될것이다. 이런 境遇에 兩國間의 債權債務를 相殺하기 爲하야 생긴 便法이 즉 手形決濟法이라는것이다.
一○, 手形決濟의 方法
例하면 日本甲은 米國B에게 對하야 四十九弗八分之七의 債務을가지고 日本의 乙은 米國A한테 同額의 債務가잇다고하자 이런 境遇에 一一히 金을 輸送輸入하는 代身에 手形決濟法을쓰랴면 엇더케하느냐?
日本의 甲이 自己의 債務者B한테 四十九弗八分之七額面의 爲替 手形을 振出한다. 乙은 爲替手形을 百圓을주고산다. 사서이것을 自己의 債權者 米國A한테로부쳐준다. A는 이 爲替手形을바더기자고 直接B한테가서 바더쓰거나 그러치안느면 自己의 去來銀行에가서 割引해쓴다. 다만 銀行에가서 割引해쓴 境遇에는 期日에가서 그銀行이 B한테가서바더오는것이다. 卽一枚의 手形振出로 兩國間의 債權債務가 金의 輸入이업시 相殺되고마는것이다.
一一, 國際間決濟法의 理由
國際間貸借에는 될수잇는 限度지는 金의 輸送이업시 前記와가튼 對外爲替를 利用하야 決濟한다. 그理由는 金을 一一히 輸送輸入하기가 貴치안을뿐만아니라 金의 受授에는 費用이든다. 卽日本에서 金貨百圓을 米國으로  輸送하려면 荷造料, 運賃, 保險料,  輸送期間의 金利의 四者를 合하야 約米弗卽一圓의 費用이든다 故로 이費用을 省略하기 爲하야 金의 現送은될수잇는대로 避하고 手形決濟法을쓰는것이라.
一二, 對外爲替의 騰落＜152＞
《注意=여긔한가지 特別히 注意할것이잇다. 일로부터『圓貨』라하면 그 日本의 圓의 基礎인 金貨를 말하는것이아니오 決局金貨와밧굴수잇는 日本銀行兌換券(紙錢을가르처말하는것이오 同樣으로『弗貨』라 或은『英貨』라할때에도 各各그나라 紙錢을가르처말하는것임에 特別한 注意를가지어야된다 何故오하면 各國紙幣의 基礎인 金貨는 金 그 自體가 價格의 尺度인닭으로 騰貴도안코 低落안는닭이다》.
外國에 對하야 債權을가진사람은 相對한 外國의 債務者가 그 外國貨幣로주어도 그것은 決局自己나라 貨幣로밧구어야될것이오 이와 反對로 外國에 對하야 債務를가진 者는 決局 그債權者한테 그 外國貨幣로주어야될것이다. 日米兩國을 例로드러말하면 米國人에게 對하야 債權을가진 境遇에는 밧기는 弗貨로바더도 그것은 決局圓貨로바더야될것이요 이와 反對로 米國에 對하야 債務가잇는 者는 決局圓貨를 弗貨로밧구어가지고야 무러주게된다. 何故하면 各國사람의 要求하는바는 決局自己나라의『돈』인닭이다 이境遇에 直接金貨를 授受하는 例는 前提『七, 金의 流出入과 通貨의 伸縮』이라는 項目에서 旣述한바와가트다.
그러고 對外爲替의 授受로 國際貸借를 決濟하는 境遇에잇서서『밧군다』는말은 무엇을 意味하느냐하면 決局例하면 米國에 對하야 債權을가진 者는 弗貨를팔사람 卽弗貨의 賣方이오 이와 反對로 米國에 對하야 債務가잇는 者는 卽弗貨를살사람 卽弗貨의 買方이다. 前期『一○, 手形決濟의 方法』에씨운 例로말하면 米國人에 對한 債權者甲은 弗貨爲替賣方이오 國人에 對한 債務者乙은 弗貨爲替의 買方이다. 故로 對外爲替決濟에잇서서는『諸外國에 對한 모든債權者는 外國貨幣의 賣方이오 이와 反對로 諸外國에 對한모든債務者는 外國貨幣의 買方이다』
故로 對外爲替는 決局普通商店과가티 賣買되는것으로 需要供給의 法則에 依하야 騰落하는것이다.
一三, 騰落의 原則
對外爲替時勢는 需要供給의 法則에 依하야 騰落하는데 이제 實例를드러보면 日米間의 貿易關係에잇서서 日本便으로보아 對米輸出보다 米國으로부터의 輸入이만허다고하자 그 結果는 輸出額卽弗貨를 파는 額보다 輸입額卽日貨를살 額이만타. 故로 需要供給의 法則에 依하야 弗貨의 供給보다 弗貨의 需要가만허지는것이니 決局은 弗貨價値가 騰費한다 卽實例로말하면 元來는 百圓이 四十九弗八分之七과가트니 이것을 標準으로 사고팔고해야될터인데 이 境遇에 弗貨가 騰貴하야 百圓對四十九弗八分之六, 或八分五 或은八分四로올나간다. 갓혼 百圓에 四十九弗八分之六이면 이것은 百圓對四十九弗八分之七보다 弗貨가 騰貴한것이오 그와 反對로 日貨는 그만치 低落된것이＜153＞다.(一圓에 四升하든쌀이 一圓에 三升하데되면 쌀갑은오르고 돈의 價値는나린것인 境遇와가트다.
一四, 騰落의 限度
(몬저한가지 말할것은 金을 정말돈으로삼는 金本位國에잇서서는 金의 輸出은 自由이다. 이것은 前所述로이미다를수도잇섯겟지만은 여긔다시한번 注意해둔다).
그러나 金輸出自由制下에잇서서는 對外爲替時勢의 騰落에는 限度가잇다. 日米間을 例로드러말하면 兩國間의 貸借決濟에 一一히 金을 現送치아니하고 爲替決濟로 弗貨를 사고팔어서 決濟하는 根本理由는 金現送에 要하는 荷造料運賃, 保險料, 輸送期間의 金利의 現送費를 省略하자는데잇는것이다. 各各自國貨幣가 平價에서 現送費를 感한것 以下로 低落될때에는 그때에는 對外爲替의 決濟法을 쓰지아니하고 金을 現送한다 例하면 日本서 金貨百圓을 米國으로 現送하는데는 現送費百圓을 要하는데 日本의 圓貨가 低落되여 四十九弗八分之三以下로러진다하면 對米債務를가진 日本의 債務者는 對外爲替에 依하야 弗貨를사서부치면 金을 現送하는것보다 損을보게되는 故로 그런 境遇에는 爲替決濟法을쓰지안니하고 金을 現送하는 者가만히생긴다. 所以로 金輸出自由制下에잇서서는 日本의 圓貨는 四十九弗八分之七의 平價에서 現送費半弗卽 八分之四弗을 減한 差四十九弗八分之三以下로는 低落되지아니한다. 이와 反對로 日本의 圓貨가 騰貴하야 平價에다 現送費를 加한 額 卽(49/6/4+7/8)五十九弗八分之三以上으로 騰貴하면 그때에는 米國의 對日債務가 爲替決濟法을스는것이 損이라하야 이 方法을그만두고 直接으로 金을 日本에 現送하야 決濟하게된다. 卽日本便으로보면 爲替時勢가이마치올나가면 그 後부터는 金이 流入하지 圓貨는더 騰貴되지못한다 卽金輸出自由制下에잇서서는 平價에다 現送費를 加한 以上으로 外國爲替時勢가더오르지는못한다 故로

卽金輸出自由制限에잇서서는 對外爲替는 平價를 中心으로도 騰落하되 最高金流入點, 最低金現送點지요 流入點以上으로오르지못하고 現送點以下로도나리지못하는것이다.
一五, 金輸出禁止理由
世界大戰時에 歐洲의 交戰各國이 金의 輸出을 禁止하니 米國이 禁止하게되고 米國이 禁止하게되니 日本도 할수업시 禁止하게된것이다.
(1) 交戰國禁止理由＜154＞
戰爭의 持續을라서 軍需品, 食料品等의 輸入이 多한 故로 對外貿易은 輸入超過가 激增한다 라서 金의 輸出을 自由로하면 金流出이 夥多하야 決局國內의 金이 全部로 流出할 念慮가잇섯기때문이요 한마지못하야 金을 輸出하는 境遇에라도 國家의 統制下에 輸出할 必要가잇섯기 때문이다.
(2) 米國의 禁止理由
當時米國은 輸出貿易旺盛으로 諸外國에 對하야 줄것보다바들것이만헛든 故로 金이 流出할 念慮는업섯다. 그러나 米國에 對한 債務國의거의 全部가 金輸出을 禁止하고보니 바들것은 金으로밧지못하고 米國이 外國에 對하야줄것만 金으로 支拂해야될 境遇에잇게되엿다. 게다가 參戰도하게되는 故로 聯合側에 加하야 宣戰하면서 禁止햇다.
(3) 日本의 禁止理由
當時日本의 形便은 米國에서는 金이드러오고 東洋諸國에 對하야는 金이 流出하는 形便이엿섯는데 米國의 禁止로 金輸入의길이끈치고보니 流出도 防止해야될수밧게업다.
(4) 朝鮮及臺灣의 禁止理由
日本의 金流出防止의 目的을 完全히 達하기 爲함이엿섯다.
一六, 全輸出禁止의 影響
(1) 爲替暴落, 國際貸借上諸外國에 줄것보다 바들것이만흐면 비록 金輸出을 禁止할지라도 日本의 圓貨値(對外爲替時勢)가러질 理由가업지마는 日本이 그러치가 못하고 年年三四億圓의 入超가잇기 때문에 日本은 貿易外受支計算中受取超過의 分이 每年約一億五千萬圓을 相殺하고도 오히려 二億圓以上의 支拂超過의 狀態에잇다 그런데 金의 輸出을 禁止하고보니 日本의 圓貨는 決局外國사람으로보기에는 信用이업는것으로보이니 低落될수밧게업다.
(2) 爲替時勢騰落의 度數頻繁
(3) 輸出商한대 大打擊
對外爲替時勢騰落의 度數가 頻繁한것은 마치 尺度가느럿다 주럿다하느것갓하서 輸出入商이 安心하고 營業을할수가업는것이다. 採算이 豫測한대로 맛지를아니하는닭이다.
(4) 物價의 騰貴
돈과 物價와는 反比例하야 騰落하는 關係에잇다 이가온데서도 爲替時勢의 低落과 그 度數가 頻繁하다는것이 首位로가는 金輸出禁止의 影響이다.
一七, 金解禁의 影響＜155＞
禁止令을 解除하면 엇더케되느냐 只今은 禁止한닭은로 日本의 圓貨時勢가 平價以下로 훨신러진 狀態에잇다. 그러나 解禁하면 적어도 正貨現送費지는 卽時로 恢復된다. 例하면 只今은 百圓對四十八弗이나 解禁만하면 곳 四十九弗八分之三지는 恢復된다. 라서
(1) 輸出入品을 始하야 物價低落
(2) 物價低落으로 商工界不振
(3) 失業者增加
(4) 一般國民의 輸入減少
(5) 金流出이 巨額에 達할 念慮가잇는것
一八, 解禁의 必要
그러면 그러케 危險하고 不利한 金解禁을 왜 斷行하려고하느냐? 그러케 反對하는사람도 적지아니하다. 그 實十餘年을두고 아직도 斷行치못하고잇는것도 그 實이것을 念慮하기 때문이다. 그러나 國際貿易上에잇서서 金輸出禁止狀態는 變態요 金의 輸出自由制가 常態이다 그런데 남이다 常態로도라갓는데 혼자 變態에잇게되면 變態에잇는 便이 恒常損害를본다. 一例를들면 日本돈의 時勢가 恒常常態國의 貨幣時勢보다 低落에잇다는것도 발서 損이다 그뿐아니라 그래가지고는 安心하고 商工業을 經營해갈수가업는것이다. 故로 一時의 困難을참고 常態로도라가서 그常態의 困難下에서 一時的苦痛을바더가면서라도 局面을 打開해야된다는말이다.
附言, 元來複雜難解의것을 주리어쓸려니 決局未備한 點이만타 讀者諒焉.＜156＞
