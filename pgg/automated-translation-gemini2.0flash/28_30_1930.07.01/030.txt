A Brief History of the Kaebyok Publishing Company

It was September 2nd of Kimisa Year (大正8年-西紀1919, Taishō 8, 1919 in the Western calendar) when the Manse Incident (萬歲事件) occurred. Yi Ton-hwa, Pak Tal-song, Yi Tu-song, and other individuals who had long intended to initiate a New Culture Movement (新文化運動) in Korea believed that establishing a media outlet was necessary for this movement. They proposed the establishment of the Kaebyok Publishing Company (開闢社) and began preparations. However, they faced difficulties due to a lack of funds. At that time, Ch'oe Chong-jong (崔宗楨), a devout believer of Ch'ŏndogyo (天道敎) in Pakch'ŏn, donated 1,000 won (一金 一千圓也), and Pyŏn Kun-hŭng (邊君恒) donated 500 won (一金 五百圓也). Using this as a foundation, they submitted a request to the authorities on December 20th of the same year for permission to publish the magazine "Kaebyok" (開闢), a media outlet based on the Newspaper Law, as their first project. This was approved on May 20th of the following year, Kyŏngsin (1920), and the inaugural issue was published on June 25th of the same year. At that time, the editor was Yi Ton-hwa, the publisher was Yi Tu-song, the printer was Min Yŏng-sun, and the president was Ch'oe Chong-jong. The location was Songhyŏn-dong (松峴洞) 34 (now right above Poseon School (普專校); at the time, it was a mere one-and-a-half room ondol (溫突房) borrowed from the Ch'ŏndogyo Kyŏngsŏng (天道敎 京城) District as the headquarters' office). The establishment of the headquarters was set in July because the inaugural issue of "Kaebyok" was published in July. In November of that year, with the publication of the 5th issue, the publication date, which had been the 25th of every month, was changed to the 1st of every month. In December of the same year, an article by Yu Chin-hŭi (兪鎭熙) (i.e., the December issue's article) became problematic, and he was fined 50 won by the Kyŏngsŏng District Court.

In the 3rd year, Imsul (大正11年, Taishō 11, 1922), on June 1st, the women's magazine "Puin" (婦人) was launched, with Yi Ton-hwa as the publisher and Min Yŏng-sun as the printer. In September of the same year, a publishing department was newly established, beginning the publication of general ideological books, and from October of the same year, permission was obtained to include current events in the "Kaebyok" magazine (originally limited to religion, academics, and literature).

In the 4th year, Kyehae (大正12年, Taishō 12, 1923), on March 1st, the children's magazine "Ŏrini" (어린이) was launched (Publisher: Pang Chŏng-hwan, Printer: Min Yŏng-sun). In order to widely connect with comrades, a membership system was created, and on September 1st of the same year, the women's magazine (published up to issue 23) was renamed "Sin Yŏsŏng" (新女性), and the first issue was published. Publisher: Pak Tal-song, Printer: Min Yŏng-sun -From the 3rd issue, Pang Chŏng-hwan changed the publisher-.

In the 6th year, Ŭlch'uk (大正14年, Taishō 14, 1925), on August 1st, the publication of "Kaebyok" magazine was suspended, and it was lifted after two and a half months on October 5th.

In the 7th year, Pyŏngin (大正15年, Taishō 15, 1926), on August 1st, the publication of "Kaebyok" magazine was prohibited. In October of the same year, "Sin Yŏsŏng" was discontinued, and on November 1st of the same year, the inaugural issue of the hobby magazine "Pyŏlgŏn'gon" (別乾坤) was published. -Publisher: Yi Ŭl, Printer: Min Yŏng-sun- From the 14th issue (Shōwa 3, July 1st), the publisher was Cha Sang-chan, and from the 24th issue (Shōwa 4, December), the printer was Chŏn Chun-sŏng -<8>

In the 10th year, Kisa (昭和4年, Shōwa 4, 1929), on March 1st, a student magazine was launched - Publisher: Pang Chŏng-hwan, Printer: Chŏn Chun-sŏng-.

Furthermore, from March of the 4th year, Kyehae (大正12年, Taishō 12, 1923), to November of the 6th year, Ŭlch'uk (大正14年, Taishō 14, 1925), for three years, the state of the 13 provinces of Korea was investigated to disseminate basic reference knowledge for all movements, and touring lectures and exhibitions were held from time to time to improve public culture.
