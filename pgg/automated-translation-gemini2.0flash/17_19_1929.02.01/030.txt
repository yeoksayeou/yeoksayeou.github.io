The Incident of King Tae's Transfer to the Russian Legation: A Record of the Great Political Upheaval of February Byeongsin, February 11th, Geonyang Year 1
Cha Sang-chan

The Queen Min Incident and the Political Situation in Hanseong

The assassination of Queen Min (閔妃 被弑) on October 8th of the Eulmi year (August 20th by the lunar calendar) was the most tragic incident in the history of the late Joseon Dynasty, causing a sudden upheaval in the political situation of Hanseong at the time. After the Sino-Japanese War in the Gapo year, the so-called pro-Russian faction, including Yi Beom-jin and Yi Yun-yong, gained power, but their influence was temporarily scattered by the gunshots of the Training Unit's riotous soldiers. The old hero Daewongun (大院君), who had been retreating to a corner of Gongdeok-ri (我笑亭) for many years, spending his days writing poetry of discontent and harmonizing with woodcutter's songs and fisherman's flutes, was incited by the Japanese envoy Miura and, guarded by Joseon and Japanese soldiers, re-entered the palace for his third regency. He formed a new cabinet, appointing his eldest son Yi Jae-myeon as Minister of the Interior, Kim Hong-jip as Prime Minister (retaining his position), Yu Gil-jun as Acting Minister of the Interior (later becoming Minister), Eo Yun-jung as Minister of Finance, Kim Yun-sik as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jo Hui-yeon as Minister of Military Affairs, Jeong Byeong-ha as Minister of Agriculture and Commerce, Seo Gwang-beom as Minister of Education, Gwon Yeong-jin as Police Chief, and Gwon Jae-hyeong (i.e., Gwon Jung-hyeon) as Chief Secretary of the Cabinet. Furthermore, in the name of the Queen Mother, he posted a proclamation to the public, stating:

"Recently, petty men have obscured wisdom, rejected the virtuous, and employed the treacherous, so that the great work of reformation is about to be abandoned midway, and the five-hundred-year-old dynasty is in danger of collapse in a single morning. Born into the family of the royal clan, I cannot bear to sit idly by. Now, I enter the palace to assist the Great Monarch, expel the wicked, accomplish the great work of reformation, and uphold the five-hundred-year-old dynasty, so that you, the people, may be at peace. You, the people, should each secure your homes and guard your occupations, and do not act rashly. If any of you, the people or soldiers, obstruct my actions, there will surely be a great penalty. Be sure not to regret it..."

At the same time, by the decree of the Great Monarch, Queen Min was deposed and made a commoner for the crime of mismanaging the country (at that time, Queen Min's life or death was unknown). The Royal Guard was incorporated into the Training Unit, the calendar was changed, setting November 17th of the 504th year of the founding of the nation as January 1st of the 505th year, adopting the solar calendar, and announcing and implementing regulations for elementary schools, vaccination, and postal services. With the renovation of other state affairs, the political circles of Hanseong felt, albeit temporarily, a sense of reform.

First Attempted Conspiracy by the Pro-Russian Faction

However, this incident of the assassination of Queen Min greatly shocked the court and the public, not only causing intense antipathy among the general Joseon people towards Japan and the new cabinet, but also, as the matter was originally serious, involving significant international relations, the Japanese government could not stand idly by in appearance. They appointed Komura Jutarō as Chargé d'affaires to investigate the truth of the matter. On October 20th of the same year, they recalled Envoy Miura, and at the same time, arrested Secretary Sugimura, ronin Okamoto Ryūnosuke, and over 40 others in Hiroshima Prison. On October 30th of the same year, Inoue Kaoru arrived in Hanseong as a special envoy to negotiate with the Joseon government. As a result, the Training Unit was disbanded by imperial decree on the same day, and the military system was reorganized, dividing the army into the Royal Guard (親衛) and the Garrison Guard (鎭衛). The Royal Guard was stationed in Gyeongseong (to protect the capital), and one unit each of the Garrison Guard was stationed in Pyeongyang and Jeonju. The officers of the former Training Unit were transferred to these newly organized units, and Training Unit Commanders Yi Du-hwang and U Beom-seon were ordered to retire (both immediately fled to Japan). Next, Minister of Military Affairs Jo Hui-yeon and Police Chief Gwon Yeong-jin were also dismissed from their posts due to responsibility issues. Park Seon, Yi Ju-hoe, and Yun Seok-u, who were directly involved in the incident, were subjected to a special court and sentenced to death. Daewongun also retired to Unhyeon Palace shortly after. The pro-Russian faction, including Yi Beom-jin, who had been driven out earlier, conspired with the Russian envoy Weber (韋貝) and, seizing this opportunity, attempted to regain power. After secretly conferring with former Ministers of Military Affairs An Gyeong-su, Yun Ung-ryeol, and Min Sang-ho at the Training Unit, on November 28th (October 12th by the lunar calendar), they gathered over 30 followers and declared their intention to restore the Queen Mother's honor, punish the current cabinet members as traitors, and, if necessary, seize the Great Monarch and the Crown Prince and move them to the Russian Legation. They attacked Gyeongbok Palace, but fortunately, the attack failed due to the valiant defense of the Royal Guard led by Shin Ung-gyun. The leaders of the rioters, Yi Do-cheol, Im Choi-su, Nam Man-ri, and Yi Min-hong (all four were officers of the Royal Guard), were immediately captured and beheaded. The remaining were dispersed by the earnest persuasion of the Acting Commander of the Military Unit, Eo Yun-jung. An Gyeong-su was captured while fleeing to Incheon, and the Yi Beom-jin and Yi Yun-yong brothers fled to the Russian or American Legations. This is what people refer to as the incident of seizing the King.

Order to Cut Hair and the Uprising of Righteous Armies in Various Regions

While the national administration was in disarray and the hearts of the people above and below were turbulent, on December 30th of the same year, the Great Monarch personally cut his hair and issued a decree, saying, "I have taken the lead in cutting my hair. You, the people, should understand my intention and achieve the great task of standing alongside all nations..." And by the notification of Minister of Interior Yu Gil-jun, he ordered all the people of the country to cut their hair and wear Western clothes and to abolish the manggeon (網巾, traditional Korean headband). Even in Gyeongseong, patrolmen were dispatched to the streets to forcibly cut the hair of passersby, and in the provinces, officials such as Chunchal Kim Gyu-sik, Ansan Magistrate An Il-rip, Naju Secretary An Jong-su, and Yangcheon Magistrate Park Jun-woo followed Gyeongseong's example and forcibly cut the hair of the people, causing the people to become even more enraged and consider starting a resistance movement. Among them, the first to raise the banner of resistance was Jeong In-hoe, a Confucian scholar from Chuncheon, Gangwon Province. He was a young man of spirit and ardor who, since the Queen Min Incident, had always been filled with sorrow and indignation. He had been working with several comrades to raise a righteous army to restore the Queen Mother's honor. Just as the order to cut hair was issued, and the officials of the same county cut their hair and ordered the soldiers and people to cut their hair by January 1st of the solar calendar, Jeong communicated with soldiers Seong Ik-hwan, Park Hyeon-seong, and others, and the soldiers and people rose up at once, occupying the government office (the officials fled in advance). They burned down the shrine of the former magistrate Min Du-ho (father of Yeong-hui), and after welcoming Confucian scholar Yi So-eung to be their leader, they sent proclamations in all directions. The great Confucian scholars Yu In-seok of the same county and Maeng Yeong-jae of Jipyeong responded at once, and their numbers reached tens of thousands. By the end of January of the first year of Geonyang, their power became even more fierce, massacring Gangwon Observer and Royal Emissary Jo In-seung and Chunchal Kim Gyu-sik. They also communicated with the righteous armies of Gyeongbuk and Honam, threatening to attack Gyeongseong day and night. The citizens of Gyeongseong, who had been terrified by the war for many years, were unable to live in peace like birds startled by a bowstring, and were enveloped in daily terror. (However, in their hearts, they hoped that the righteous army would arrive in Gyeongseong soon, and there were many who communicated with them.) As things reached this point, the government was forced to stop cutting hair and sent Royal Emissaries to persuade them to disband repeatedly, but to no avail. Finally, they dispatched more than half of the Royal Guard as a suppression force, leaving the palace almost empty. (At that time, the Chuncheon righteous army fought with the Gyeong army in the territory of Gapyeong County and was defeated.)

Alas, the National Affairs Have Come to This

The one who thought of this as a good opportunity of a thousand years and used all his cunning, leaping like a wild beast, was none other than the Russian envoy Weber. That man, having lost his power in the palace at the same time as Queen Min's downfall, and having failed in his first attempt to seize the King by manipulating Yi Beom-jin's faction, who were like his hawks and hounds, had been fretting over recovering his own power through various plots. Now, taking advantage of the protection of the legation, he had 100 sailors from Incheon enter the capital on February 9th and stationed them in the legation. He then colluded with palace maids, Yang Sang-gung, and eunuch Gang Seok-ho, on the one hand, telling King Tae the need for pro-Russian policies, and on the other hand, threatening that the righteous armies of the provinces would soon occupy Gyeongseong, endangering even the King's safety. Originally alarmed by the Queen Min Incident, King Tae was also seized by fear and disregarded the dignity of the nation and the dignity of the monarch, wishing only to escape somewhere for his personal safety, and gave his inner consent. Yi Beom-jin's faction, having plotted everything in this way, led over 50 Russian soldiers at dawn on the 11th of the same month (January 2nd by the lunar calendar), rushing like a whirlwind along the small road of Bukjang-dong and bursting into the New Military Gate. King Tae and the Crown Prince rode in palanquins carried by palace maids, and along with several eunuchs who had been pre-arranged to help, moved out of the palace and transferred to the Russian Legation under the protection of Russian soldiers. Queen Dowager Hong and Crown Princess Min moved to Gyeongun Palace (i.e., Deoksu Palace). This fact was a top-secret action that no one knew except for the pro-Russian faction, even among the senior officials at the time, a disastrous plan unprecedented in history. After carrying out such a sudden action, Yi Beom-jin and others dispatched soldiers and policemen to the palace to carry out executions. Prime Minister Kim Hong-jip and Minister of Agriculture Jeong Byeong-ha, hearing of the change, were arrested by officer An Hwan while entering the palace and brutally murdered outside the main gate of the Police Agency. Their bodies were displayed on Jongno, where they were subjected to unspeakable insults by the rioters. Eo Yun-jung fled to his hometown in Yongin, where he was brutally murdered by the villagers. Gwon Yeong-jin, U Beom-seon, and Yi Du-hwang sensed the danger and fled first. Yu Gil-jun was arrested and dragged to the crossroads in front of Gwanghwamun, but fortunately, he was saved by Japanese soldiers stationed at the Three Armies Headquarters (present-day Joseon Infantry Unit) and fled to Japan, barely saving his life. Others, such as Jo Hui-yeon, Yi Jin-ho, Yi Beom-rae, and Jang Bak, also fled to Japan. Kim Hong-jip's cabinet thus met its doom. Thereupon, the Russian envoy reinforced 200 sailors from a Russian warship anchored in Incheon and strictly guarded the Jeong-dong area. Without Yi Beom-jin's approval, even high officials could not enter or leave freely. On the one hand, he earnestly requested King Tae to issue a formal decree from within the Russian Legation, pardoning Yi Min-hong, An Gyeong-su, and Nam Man-ri, who had been executed in the November 28th incident. An Gyeong-su was reappointed as Police Chief, Yi Beom-jin as Head of the Justice Ministry, Yi Wan-yong as Head of the Foreign and Education Ministries, Kim Byeong-si as Prime Minister, and Park Jeong-yang as Acting Prime Minister. From then on, the world of Joseon completely fell into the hands of the pro-Russian faction, and all state affairs were swayed by the Russian envoy. The King and his son lived like refugees in a corner of the Russian Legation, their every move controlled. The national situation at the time was truly disheartening, and it was better not to speak of it.

Concessions Granted to Foreign Countries During the Sojourn

Russia, having forced the monarch of Joseon into its own legation and placed him under its sphere of influence, and protecting the pro-Russian cabinet with military force, not only seized the two supervisory powers of finance and military affairs with two influential advisors, but also trained the Joseon army with 20 officers, purchased 400 rifles and ammunition from Posiet Bay, established a Russian language school, and acquired the mining rights of Gyeongwon and Jongseong and the railway construction rights from the mining area to the coast or border (in April of the first year of Geonyang, the Russian Nishichenski acquired these rights), rushing to cultivate its power. At the same time, to gain favor with other foreign countries, it evenly distributed some benefits. That is, from February of the Byeongsin year to February of the following year, the major concessions granted by the so-called Joseon government to foreign countries while King Tae was staying in the Russian Legation are as shown in the table below.

Month/Year       Concession Granted       Nationality/Name

Geonyang 1, March Gyeongin Railway Construction Right American Morse

Geonyang 1, April Mining Rights of Gyeongwon, Jongseong Russian Nishichenski

Geonyang 1, July Gyeongui Railway Construction Right French Gulieru

Geonyang 1, Sept. Logging Rights of Musan, Amnok River Basin, Ulleungdo Russian Briner

Geonyang 1, April Unsan Gold Mine Mining Right American Morse

Geonyang 2, March Gangwon-do Geumseong Danghyeon Gold Mining Right German Oluda

Among the above table, the Gyeongin Railway Construction Right, along with the Gyeongbu Railway Construction Right, was first granted to Japan in the Gapo year by a joint treaty with the Japanese government, but the validity period expired due to the Sino-Japanese War. The Gyeongin Railway was transferred to the American Morse, and the Gyeongbu Railway was transferred to the Japanese Sasaki Kiyoma. Later, the Gyeongin Line was transferred to the management of Shibusawa Eiichi's company in the middle of construction. Following this, in January of the 2nd year of Gwangmu, the American Goldfield obtained the Gyeongseong Tram Construction Right, in May of the 4th year of Gwangmu, the Englishman "Mokang" obtained the Pyongnam Eunsan Gold Mine, and in August of the same year, the Japanese Shibusawa Eiichi and Asano Soichiro obtained the Jiksan Gold Mine Mining Right in Chungnam. In the Gihae year of the 3rd year of Gwangmu, the whaling rights of the three provinces of Hamgyeong were granted to the Russians, and in March of the Gyeongja year of the 4th year of Gwangmu, the right to install a coal storage depot and naval hospital for the Russian Far East Fleet in the Gurigumi Bay near Masan was granted to Russia. This transfer to the Russian Legation not only placed the government temporarily under Russian interference, but also opened the door for granting concessions of the entire Joseon to foreign countries.
(In February of the following year, the King finally returned to Deoksu Palace, and in the meantime, the Independence Association arose and had many conflicts with the government. However, since the articles of the Independence Association have already been published in this magazine, they are omitted here.)

李太王俄館播遷事件 丙申二月大政變記, 建陽元年二月十一日
						車相瓚
閔妃事變과 漢城政局
乙未 10월 8일(음8월20일) 閔妃 被弑의 事變은 李朝末葉 史上에 가장 비통한 事變으로 당시 漢城政局에 급격한 대파동을 이르키엿다. 甲午日 淸戰役後 새로 생겨난 소위 親露派 李範晋
李允用 等魑*의 亂影으 訓練隊暴兵의 총소래에 一時 살아 흐트지고 다년간 孔德里一隅(我笑亭)에 退臥하야 不平의 詩歌로 樵歌漁笛을 和答하며 閒歲月을 보내던 老傑大院君은 日公使 三浦의 衝動으로 朝日兵에 擁衛되야 제3차 攝政으로 다시 入闕하며 新內閣을 조직하야 그의 長子 李載冕은 宮內 府大臣 金宖集은 摠理(仍任), 兪吉濬은 內部大臣署理(未久에 大臣이 됨) 魚允中은 度支大臣, 金允植은 外部大臣, 趙羲淵은 軍部大臣, 鄭秉夏는 農商大臣, 徐光範은 學部大臣, 權瀅鎭은 警務使, 權在衡(즉 權重顯)은 內閣摠書로 임명하고 또 國太公의 名義로 左記와 如한 布告文을 中外에 榜示하며
『近日에 群小가 聰明을 *蔽하야 賢을 斥하고 奸을 用하매 維新의 大業이 장차 中途에 廢하고 오백년 宗社가 一朝에 危한지라. 余가 宗親의 家에 生하야 참아 그것을 坐視치 못하겠슴으로 今에 闕에 入하야 大君主를 輔翼하고 群邪를 斥逐하야 維新의 대업을 성취하고 오백년 宗社를 扶持하야 爾等百姓을 安케하랴 하노니 爾等百姓은 各히 其堵를 安하고 其業을 守하야 輕動치 말라. 만일에 爾等百姓과 兵士가 나의 行하는＜6＞일에 저해하는 자가 잇스면 밧듯시 큰 죄가 잇슬터이니 爾等은 후회가 업도록 하라...』
同時에 大君主의 詔로 閔妃의 亂政誤國한 죄를 들어 妃를 廢하야 庶人을 삼고(其時까지 閔妃의 생사가 不明함) 侍衛隊를 訓練隊에 편입하며 正朔을 곳치여서 개국 504년 11월 17일을 505년 1월 1일로 정하야 태양력을 채용하기로 하고 소학교, 종두, 우편 등 규칙을 발표, 실시하며 기타의 정무를 쇄신하니 漢城의 政界는 비록 일시형식이나마 일신개혁의 感이 不無하얏다.

親露派의 第一回 陰謨失敗
그러나 이 閔妃弑害의 事變은 朝野가 크게 驚動하야 일반 조선 사람의 對日 對新內閣에 반감이 격심하게 될 뿐 아이라 事體가 원래 중대하야 國際上 莫大의 관계가 잇슴으로 日本 정부는 體面上 坐視키 難하야 小村壽太郞으로 辦理公使를 임명하야 사실의 진상을 조사한 후同年 10월 20일에 三浦公使를 소환하는 동시에 杉村書記官, 浪人岡本柳之助 이외 40餘人을 一並 廣島獄에 체포하고 同 10월 30일에 井上馨은 慰問使로 漢城에 來着하야 朝鮮 정부와 折衝한 결과 당일에 勅令으로 훈련대를 해산하고 다시 군제를 변경하야 육군을 親衛 鎭衛 이종으로 편제하고 친위대는 京城에(王城護衛), 진위대는 平壤, 全州에 각 一隊식 置하고 舊훈련대의 사관은 此編制隊에 移屬하고 훈련대장 李斗璜, 禹範善은 休職을 命하며,(二人은 즉시 日本으로 망명함) 次에 軍部大臣 趙羲淵, 警務使 權瀅鎭도 또한 책임 문제로 官을 免하고 此사건에 직접 관계가 有한 朴銑, 李周會, 尹錫禹 등 三人은 특별법원에 附하야 사형에 처하고 大院君도 또한 未久에 雲峴宮으로 退位하니 前日에 驅逐을 당한 親露派 李範晋 등은 露公使 뻐베르(韋貝)와 음모하고 이 기회를 타서 다시 정권을 奪回하랴고 前군부대신 安駉壽, 尹雄烈, 閔商鎬 등과 훈련원에서 密議한 후 11월 28일(陰 10월 12일) 새벽에 30餘 徒黨을 嘯聚하야 國母의 復警할 일과 당시 내각원을 반역당으로 討罪할 事와 만일의 경우에는 대군주 及 왕태자까지 奪取하야 俄館으로 遷御실힐 事를 聲言하고 景福宮을 襲擊하다가 幸히 申羽均의 率한 친위대의 용감한 방어로 事가  실패에 歸하고 당시 亂徒의 대장인 李道徹, 林最洙, 南萬里, 李敏宏(4인은 皆친위대 사관)은 일시 捕縛되야 斬刑에 處하고 餘衆은 군대署理 魚允中의 간독한 設諭로 解散되고 安駉壽는 仁川으로 도망하다가 중도에 被囚하고 기타 李範晋, 李允用 형제 등은 俄館 혹 米館으로 망명하니 이것이 즉 세인의 이르는 바 국왕奪取의 사건이다.

斷髮令과 各地 義兵의 蜂起
이와 가티 國政이 紊亂하야 上下의 인심이 洶洶한 중에 同年 12월 30일에는 加之大君主가 親히 髮을 削하고 또 詔를 下하야 曰 『朕이 率先하야 髮을 削하얏노니 爾有衆은 朕의 意를 體하야＜7＞ 萬國과 並立하는 대업을 成하라...』 하고 內部大臣 兪吉濬의 告示로 전국 인민에게 斷髮 洋服할 事와 網巾 廢止할 事를 命하고 심지어 京城에서는 巡檢을 市街에 派送하야 통행하는 인민의 두발을 강제로 勒削하고 지방에 잇서서도 忠察 金奎軾, 安山郡守 安日立, 羅州叅書官 安宗洙, 陽川郡守 朴準禹 가튼 이는 京城을 倣하야 또한 인민의 두발을 勒削하니 인민이 더욱 激憤하야 누구나 반항의 운동을 이르키랴고 생각하엿섯다. 其中에 제일 먼저 반기를 든 사람은 江原道 春川 儒生 鄭寅會엿다. 그는 年少氣銳한 청년으로 向者 閔妃遭變의 亂이 잇슨 뒤로 항상  悲憤慷慨하야 여려 동지와 가티 國母 復敬의 의병을 이르키랴고 운동하던 중 마츰 斷髮令이 나려 同郡의 諸官吏가 일제 削髮하고 양력 1월 1일을 期하야 일반 군병 及 인민에게 削髮할 事를 命하매 鄭은 군인의 成益煥, 朴玄成등과 상통하고 군대 及 인민이 일시에 봉기하야 官衙를 점령하고(관리는 知機先逃함) 前留守 閔斗鎬(泳微의 父)의 生祠堂을 불지르며 유학자 李昭應을 迎하야 대장을 삼은 뒤에 사방에 格을 傳하니 同郡의 巨儒 柳麟錫, 砥平의 孟英在 등이 一時 相應하야 其數가 屢萬에 이르더니 建陽 元年 1월말경에는 그 세가 더욱 熾盛하야 江原觀察 兼 宜諭使 曺寅承과 忠察 金奎軾을  학살하고 또 慶北, 湖中의 義旅와 도 氣 脈을 통하야 朝 夕으로 京城을 襲擊한다 聲言하니 다년간 兵火에 놀내인 京城의 시민은 蔦弓의 鳥와 가티 安堵를 못하고 晝*恐怖의 중에 싸여 잇섯다. (그러나 內心에는 의병이 速히 京城에 도착하기를 희망하고 氣 脈을 통한 사람도 만헛다.) 事가 此에 至하매 정부는 부득이 삭발을 중지하고 또 宜諭使를 遺하야 再三 解散을 勸誘하얏스나 其效가 無함으로 최후로 親衛隊兵의 과반수를 토벌군으로 派送하니 宮城은 殆히 공허한 상태에 이르럿다. (其時 春川 의병은 加平郡境에서 京軍과 싸우다가 패하얏다.)

嗚呼國事遂至於此
이를 千載의 好時期로 생각하고 가진 凶計를 다 부러서 野獸猛取的 飛躍을 한 자는 例의 露公使 뻐베르엿다. 그 자는 閔妃 몰락 동시에 궁중의 세력을 일코 鷹犬의 李範晋 일파를 使囑하야 제 1회의 國王 奪取 運動을 하다가 또한 실패한 후 백방의 음모를 하야 自家의 세력挽回에 腐心하더니 이에 이르러는 공사관의 보호를 藉口하고 2월 9일에 仁川에 잇는 水兵 100명을 입성케 하야 영사관내에 예치하고 다시 李範晋 등으로 당시 궁녀 楊상궁과 내시 姜錫鎬를 籠絡하야 일방으로 李太王에게 親露의 필요를 말하고 또 일방으로는 지방의 의병이 不日에 京城을 점령하는데 군왕의 신변에 까지 위험이 잇슬 것을 위협하니 원래  閔妃事件에 警魂이 된 李太王은 또한 공포심이 생겨서 국가의 체면이고 군주의 체면이고 다 不願하고 다만 개인의 생명을 위하야 어듸로나 避身을 하랴고 內諾하얏다. 만반의 일을 이와 가티 뀌며 노흔 李範晋 일파는 同월 11일(陰 정월 2일) 첫 새벽에 萬賴가 俱寂한 틈을 타서 50여명의 俄兵을 率하고 疾風迅雷와 가티 北壯洞小路를 좃차서 新武門으로 突入하니＜8＞ 李太王과 王太子는 궁녀의 較子를 타고 미리 內應이 된 內侍 數人과 가티 궁중을 移하야 俄兵의 護衛로 俄館에 播遷하고 王大妃 洪씨와 王太子妃 閔씨는 慶運宮(즉 德壽宮)으로 移御하니 이 사실은 親露派 이외에는 당시 대관중에도 누구나 알지 못한 극비밀의 행동으로 천고에 其例가 無한 망국의 誤計엿다. 李範晋 등은 이와 가튼 급격한 행동을 감행한 후 또 兵隊와 警官을 궁중에 派送하야 誅*을 대행하니 摠理 金宏集과 農大 鄭秉夏는 變을 聞하고 궁중으로 드러 오다가 譊�官 安桓에게 被捉하야 警務廳 大門 外에서 慘殺을 당한 후 屍體는 鐘路에 *示하야 亂民에게 無狀의 욕을 보고, 魚允中은 龍仁 鄕第로 逃避하다가 村民에게 慘殺되고 權혁*鎭
禹範善
李斗璜은 機를 알고 먼저 도망하며 兪吉濬은 체포되야 光化門앞 총각있는데 까지 끌여가다가 幸히 三軍府(現 朝鮮 步兵隊)를 派守하던 日兵의 救護로 僅히 생명을 保하야 日本에 망명하고 기타 趙熙淵, 李軫鎬, 李範來, 張博 등도 또한 日本으로 망명하니 金宏集의 내각은 그만 운명을 맛치고 마럿다. 이에 俄國 公使는 다시 仁川에 정박한 자국 군함에서 수군 200명을 증원하야 貞洞 일대를 엄중이 警衛하고 李範晋의 認狀이 無하면 비록 大官도 출입을 자유로 못하게 하며 일방으로 李太王에게 秦請하야 俄館 內에서 정식의 詔를 下하야 11월 28일 사건으로 처형된 李敏宏, 安駉壽, 南萬里 등의 죄를 特赦하고 安駉壽는 다시 警務使, 李範晋은 法大, 李完用은 外大 겸 學大, 金炳始는 摠理로 朴定陽은 임시 그 署理를 보게 되니 이로부터 朝鮮의 천하는 全然이 親露派의 수중으로 도라가고 萬般의 政事는 俄公使의 鼻息 알에 좌우하며 君上의 父子는 일개 流寓의 客과 가티 俄館 一隅에서 起居動作하니 당시 국사는 실로 寒心冷膽하야 寧히 言치 아는 것이 可하게 되엿다.

播遷 中에 外國에 割讓된 利權
露國은 이와 가티 自國의 公館 內에 朝鮮의 군주를 强請하야 자기 세력 범위하에 置하고 병력으로 親露內閣을 보호하는 외에 유력한 顧問 二人으로 재정 及 군사의 두 감독권을 占케하고 20인의 사관으로 朝鮮의 군대를 훈련케 하며 소총 400挺과 탄약을 浦鹽으로부터 매입케 하며 露語학교를 창설하고 慶源, 鐘城의 광산채굴권과 채광지에서 해안 又는 국경까지至하는 鐵道敷設權을 획득(建陽 원년 4월에 露人 니시치엔스기가 此권리를 획득함)하야 세력 扶植에 급급할 뿐 안이라 그와 동시에 他外國에도 호감을 엇기 위하야 幾許의 이익을 均霑케 하얏스니, 즉 丙申 2월로부터 翌年 丁酉 2월까지 李太王이 俄館에 체류하는＜9＞ 중에 소위 朝鮮의 정부로부터 諸外國에 할양한 이권의 주요한 者을 擧하면 左表와 如하다.

右表 중 京仁鐵道敷設權은 京釜鐵道敷設權과 共히 甲午年에 먼저 日本 정부와 합동 조약으로 경영권을 日本에 許하엿스나, 日淸전쟁의 관계로 시효가 空過하얏승으로 其中 京仁鐵道는 米人 모-루스에게 轉許하고 京釜鐵은 日本人 佐佐木淸磨에 轉許하엿더니 후에 京仁線은 起*中途에 또 澁澤榮一의 회사에 경영으로 도라갓섯다. 此를 繼하야 尙又 光武 2년 1월에 米人 骨佛安은 京城電車敷設權을 得하고 同 4년 5월에 英人 『몰칸』은 平南殷山金鑛 同年 8월에 日本人 澁澤榮一, 淺野總一郞은 忠南 稷山의 金鑛採掘權을 得하고, 그 光武 3년 己亥에는 露人에게 咸江慶 三道의 捕鯨權을 許하고, 同 4년 庚子 3월에는 馬山 부근 栗九味灣에도露國에 東洋艦隊의 石炭貯藏所 及 해군병원 설치할 事를 露國에 許하얏다. 이 俄館의 播遷은 다만 일시 정권이 露國의 간섭을 밧게 되엿슬 뿐 안니라 朝鮮 전체의 이권을 외국에 할여하는 端緖를 열엇섯다.
(익년 2월에 太王은 비로소 德壽宮으로 還御하고 其間에 獨立協會가 이러나서 정부와 모든 衝突이 잇섯다. 그러나 獨立協會의 記事는 本誌에 이미 發布되야섯기 여긔 略한다.)＜10＞
