The Thrilling Pyongyang Battle of Yi Yu-song, February 17th, Seonjo Gyesa
						Suseong Hak-in

Ming's Second Mobilization of Troops

It is December of the 25th year of Seonjo, Imjin. After the first Joseon rescue army of Ming (commanded by Jo Seung-hun and Sa Yu, etc.) failed in Pyongyang, Ming mobilized a second large army. Song Eung-chang, the Vice Minister of War (兵部侍郞), was appointed as the manager (經略), and Yi Yu-song, the Duke of Ningxia (都督寧夏候), was appointed as the commander of military affairs (都督軍務), dispatching over 43,000 troops from the north and south. Deputy Commander Yang Won, as the Left Auxiliary General (左協大將), commanded Deputy Commanders Wang Wi-ik, Wang Wi-jeong, Military Secretaries Yi Yu-mae, Yi Yu-o (the two Yis were Yu-song's younger brothers), Yang So, Vanguard Deputy Commanders Cha Dae-su, Son Su-ryeom, Military Secretary Yi Nyeong, and Guerrilla Commander Gal Bong-ha, etc. Deputy Commander Yi Yu-baek, as the Central Auxiliary General (中協大將), commanded Deputy Commanders Im Ja-gang, Military Secretary Yi Bang-chun, and Guerrilla Commanders Go Chaek, Jeon Se-jeong, Jeok Geum, Ju Hong-mo, Bang Si-hwi, Go Seung, and Wang Mun, etc. Deputy Commander Jang Se-myeong, as the Right Auxiliary General (右協大將), commanded Jo Seung-hun (who, due to his defeat, served as a soldier in white clothes to atone for his failure), Deputy Commanders O Yu-chung, Wang Pil-di, Military Secretaries Jo Ji-mok, Jang Eung-hwa, Nak Sang-ji, Chen Bang-cheol, and Guerrilla Commanders Gok Su, Ryang Sim, etc. Military Secretary Bang Si-chun served as the Central Army Commander, Han Jong-gong and Yi Bong-yang were flag officers, Bureaucrats Yu Hwang-sang and Yuan Hwang of the Ministry of War were in charge of planning, and Ai Wi-sin of the Ministry of Revenue was in charge of supervising provisions. The Ming Emperor ordered them to accompany and aid Joseon, and specially dispatched Guerrilla Commander Jang Gi-gong to transport gold, silver, horses, and grain to Uiju, resulting in a total of over sixty brave generals. However, Yu-song stopped at Tongwon Fortress (通遠堡), refusing to advance, while Eung-chang and Hwang-sang remained in Liaodong, controlling the generals and observing the situation. The Joseon government was extremely anxious and sent Chief (執義) Yi Ho-min again, explaining the urgency of the situation and the need to attack the enemy swiftly. Yu-song announced that he would advance in January, but he still hesitated and did not advance. The court then sent Historian (史判) Yi San-bo, who pleaded urgently, tears streaming down his face as he spoke. Yu-song was moved by his righteousness and finally had Jeon Se-jeong cross the Yalu River first on December 22nd with 3,000 southern soldiers. Yu-song followed across the river on the 24th, with flags and banners stretching for a thousand li and drums shaking the mountains and rivers. On that day, a white rainbow pierced the sun, and a right arc appeared in the sun. Yu-song was greatly pleased, telling his troops that it was a sign of sure victory. The king and officials of Joseon were even more pleased than meeting sweet rain in a great drought, giving them a grand welcome along the way.

Yi Yu-song's Character

Yi Yu-song, whose pen name was Yangseong (仰誠), was the son of Yi Seong-ryang, the Duke of Nyeongwon (寧遠伯 李成樑). His grandfather was originally a Korean who lived in Wiwon, Pyeongbuk, but after committing murder in an incident near the Tumen River, he and his wife fled to Liaodong, Tieling Garrison (遼東 鐵寧衛), where he became a guerrilla commander through border merits. His son, Seong-ryang, also had exceptional martial arts skills and repeatedly achieved border merits, becoming the Military Secretary of Heomsan Fortress (險山堡叅將). Within a few years, he made great contributions again, becoming a Commander-in-Chief (摠兵), expanding the territory by a thousand li and establishing five fortresses (五堡), and his achievements were elevated to the rank of Duke (伯爵). Seong-ryang's six sons, Yu-song, Yu-jang, Yu-baek, Yu-mae, Yu-o, and Yu-jeong, were all great generals of their time, all reaching the position of Commander-in-Chief. In addition, more than ten of his sons-in-law and nephews became high-ranking officials, and the world praised the family's remarkable status, comparing it to Guo Fenyang of the Tang Dynasty. Yu-song's mother, Lady Suk (宿氏), was also a female hero with a resounding reputation. At that time, Yu-song had destroyed the Ningxia bandits Liu Dong-chang, Yi Seung-eun, etc., with an army of 100,000, and before he had even returned from his campaign, the Ming Emperor ordered him to rescue Joseon. Yu-song initially wanted to decline due to illness, but his mother, Lady Suk, spoke earnestly, saying that Joseon was her motherland, and warned him. Yu-song was also moved and resolutely set out. At that time, Yu-song wore red brocade and rode in a red palanquin, meeting King Seonjo at the Uisun Hall (義順館). Seonjo was greatly pleased at first sight, thanking him for his long journey and the Ming Emperor for his virtue in rescuing a neighboring country. He then said that the thread of life of the Eastern Kingdom lay with Yu-song. Yu-song smiled and said that this was all due to the majesty and virtue of our Emperor and the great fortune of the King of Joseon, which would lead to the extermination of the enemy, so why should he thank me excessively? Furthermore, he said, as a foreign minister, he was originally from Joseon, so his parents had personally warned him strictly before he set out on this campaign. Even if he sacrificed his life, how could he betray Joseon? His manners were very respectful and his speech was fluent, which greatly pleased the Joseon court, and they treated him generously.

Leading Troops Through the Starry Night to the Riverbank

It is said that Yi Yu-song left Uiju for Pyongyang with 45,000 soldiers, 80,000 seok of grain, and 20,000 geun of gunpowder. The orderliness of the military formation and the dignity of their power gave the impression of being truly invincible. Arriving in Anju, he camped on the banks of the Cheongcheon River. Ryu Seong-ryong welcomed Yu-song and had him seated in the Dongheon of the Anju County Office, where he took out a map of Pyongyang from his sleeve, clearly indicating the terrain and pointing out the routes for the troops. Yu-song admired Seong-ryong's insight and listened attentively, marking the key locations with a red brush, saying, "The Japanese only rely on bird guns (鳥銃), but we have cannons (大砲) with a power that can reach 5 or 6 li, so how can the enemy withstand it?" After Seong-ryong had left, Yu-song sent a poem to Seong-ryong to show his intentions. The poem read:
"Leading troops through the starry night to the riverbank, to say that the three Han countries are not yet at peace.
Our gracious lord sends reports of victory daily, and your humble servant releases joy with cups of wine at night.
Wearing killing intent, my heart is still strong, compared to dispelling evil energy, my bones are already cold.
Daring to speak of non-winning strategies in jest, I still dream of riding my saddle in my dreams."

It was the 10th day of the second month of Gyesa in the spring (January 1st). Yu-song sent Cha Dae-su to the Japanese camp in Sunan to deceive them, saying that the Ming Dynasty had already permitted peace and that Guerrilla Commander Sim Yu-gyeong was also coming (previously, after Jo Seung-hun's defeat, Sim Yu-gyeong of Ming negotiated peace with the Japanese envoy Hyeon So (a monk) and agreed to a 50-day truce; this was Ming's delaying tactic). <3> The Japanese envoy Hyeon So was greatly pleased and sent a poem, saying, "Fusang ceases war and submits to China, the four seas and nine provinces are now one family. Joyful air still dispels foreign snow, and spring arrives early in heaven and earth with peaceful flowers," etc. He had the small general Pyeong Ho-gwan lead over 20 riders to welcome Yu-gyeong to Sunan Hall. This was Hyeon So falling into Yu-song's trap. Dae-su kept Pyeong Ho-gwan's group of dozens of people drinking in the hall, and taking advantage of their drunkenness, he ambushed and killed them all at once. Only three people managed to escape and report the fact, and the enemy finally realized the great arrival of Ming soldiers, and they were greatly shocked and fled in the night. The main army arrived in Sukcheon, and as they finished their supper, the report of victory in Sunan arrived. Yu-song, full of righteous spirit, tightened his bow and rode onto his horse, heading straight for Sunan with a few riders. The soldiers in the other camps dared not stay behind and set out one after another, arriving at Pyongyang Castle like a whirlwind on the early morning of the 6th. Until then, the enemy did not know of the arrival of the Ming army, and the Joseon military camps, including the Commander-in-Chief, were also advancing towards Pyongyang. (Previously, the enemy had bribed the lawless rabble of Joseon with gold to scout the armies in Anju, Uiju, Sunan, etc., but the matter was discovered in Anju, and one of them was beheaded and strictly warned, so the remaining men dared not harbor disloyal intentions again, and as a result, the enemy's scouting was cut off, and they were completely unaware of the arrival of the Ming soldiers.)

The Earth-Shattering Battle of Pyongyang

On the morning of the 8th day (February 17th), Yu-song finished feeding his troops and discussed with the officers of the three camps, dividing the troops and forming a line outside the Samsung, Botong, and Hamgyu gates. They beat drums, blew trumpets, and provoked a battle. The enemy lined up white flags on the castle and resisted. Yu-song was filled with anger and personally led hundreds of hand-picked cavalrymen, approaching the castle and directing the generals. Suddenly, he fired a cannon, and all the camps responded at once, firing cannons again. The sound shook the heavens and the earth, and the flames soared into the sky, turning dozens of li into darkness like night. The fierce fire and wind rushed straight into the castle, and the mud fortresses (密德의 土窟) were first burned down, and other mud fortresses were burned down in succession. Yu-song then encouraged his troops to climb the castle directly. The enemy shot bird guns and large stones like a rain, and their momentum was so fierce that many died, causing the Ming army to retreat slightly. Yu-song personally drew his sword and beheaded one of the retreating soldiers, stepping forward and shouting loudly to the army, "Whoever is the first to climb the castle will be rewarded with fifty taels of silver!" Nak Sang-ji, starting from Hamgyu Gate, carried a long spear in his hand and a cannon under his arm, leaping several jangs and climbing the castle first. O Yu-chung also followed and climbed the castle (both generals were from the South; Nak was originally extremely strong, so he was called Nak Cheon-geun in the army). The troops beat drums and rushed up like ants. The soldiers from Zhejiang, wearing red clothes, climbed the castle, pulled down the enemy flags, and raised the Ming flags. The enemy suspected them to be divine soldiers and fled in fear. Yu-song, together with Jang Se-jak, attacked the Chilseong Gate, breaking down the gate tower with cannons and leading the troops in. Yi Yu-baek entered through the Hamgyu Gate, and Yang Won entered through the Botong Gate, pursuing the fleeing enemy. The cavalrymen also followed, and their momentum was like an angry tide, so the enemy dared not resist and fled into the inner castle. The Ming soldiers entered the castle all at once and attacked the inner castle again. This inner castle had many mud fortresses and many holes, like a beehive, and they fired bullets from the holes, causing many injuries to the Ming soldiers. Yu-song, thinking that attacking the cornered enemy was rather disadvantageous, withdrew his troops and retreated outside the castle. Then, he recruited Jang Dae-seon of Zhejiang, who had defected to the enemy the previous day, and had him go to the enemy camp to persuade them, saying, "Our forces are sufficient to annihilate you, but for the sake of human life, we cannot bear to annihilate you and <4> open a path of survival for you, so retreat quickly." Haeng-jang (行長) requested that the rear road not be cut off and made a mutual promise. They fled at night, and Pyongyang was recovered, and the enemies of Junghwa and Hwangju also fled. In this battle, the number of Japanese soldiers killed was 1,255, the number of horses captured was 2,985, the number of military weapons captured was 45,000, and the number of Joseon people who had been taken captive and were rescued was 1,150 men and women. The number of Ming soldiers killed was also not small. At that time, Yu-song secretly ambushed Yi Nyeong, Jo Seung-hun, etc., in the key locations and attacked the fleeing enemy, beheading 350 and capturing two alive. Haeng-jang, Uiji, Hyeon So, and Jo Sin led the remaining troops and fled south, but their strength was exhausted, their legs were injured (傷*) and they crawled along the road, and they were in a dire situation because their food was scarce and they even begged for food from the civilians. However, Yi Si-eon, the Defense Commissioner of Hwanghae, Kim Gyeong-ro, etc., who had been stationed in key locations, dared not pursue them and only defended themselves. Only after the enemy had passed did they fire cannons to threaten them. At the time, everyone could not help but curse this.

The Victory at Pyongyang and the Situation in Joseon

This victory at Pyongyang was the greatest success of the Ming army and turned back the fate of Joseon, which was nearing its end. After the victory at Pyongyang, Yu-song became arrogant and openly despised the Joseon court and officials. Also, as a result of underestimating the enemy, he suffered a crushing defeat at Byeokje and retreated to Pyongyang again, daring not to advance south. However, this victory had a tremendous impact on Joseon. At that time, if Yu-song had been defeated again like Jo Seung-hun and Sa Yu, etc., the enemy would surely have rushed straight to Yongwan, causing Seonjo to be banished to an isolated foreign land west of the Yalu River, and consequently, the people of Joseon would have been completely dispersed, and Ming would have had no courage to send reinforcements again, and in the end, the three thousand li of the divine land would have been trampled by the enemy. However, as a result of this great victory at Pyongyang with the help of heaven and the gods, the general public of Joseon gained the courage and ambition to restore the country, and troops loyal to the king rose up like swarms of bees in various places. On February 3rd (March 13th), Commander-in-Chief Gwon Yul won a great victory at Haengju, and subsequently, the capital, Gyeongseong, was recovered, and the Ming army also advanced south. Yi Sun-sin won a great victory in the naval battles of Hansan and Noryang, and Joseon was finally restored. In conclusion, during the Imjin War, the battles of Pyongyang in the north and Hansando Island in the south were the most fierce and the most successful of all the battles at the time, preserving the Joseon dynasty and its people. Of course, Admiral Chungmu was the only loyal subject in Joseon at the time, and Yi Yu-song's ancestors were originally from Joseon, so his parents gave him strict warnings, and he also followed his parents' instructions well, dedicating himself thoroughly to assisting Joseon. From this, we can see that the blood of the nation is something that cannot be taken lightly. Later, after the fall of the Ming Dynasty, the descendants of Yu-song and Yu-mae, etc., immigrated to Joseon again and settled there for generations, so how could this be considered an ordinary matter? <5>

痛快無比한 李如松의 平壤大戰, 宣祖癸巳二月十七日
						壽春學人
明의 第二回動兵
宣祖 25년 壬辰 십이월이다. 明의 제1회 朝鮮救援軍(祖承訓, 史儒等統率)이 平壤에서 실패하니 明은 제2回로다. 시大兵을 動하게 되엿다. 兵部侍郞 宋應昌으로 經略을 삼고 都督寧夏候 李如松으로 都督軍務를 삼고 南北兵 43,000여兵을 出하야 副摠兵 楊元은 左協大將으로 副摠兵 王維翼, 王維貞, 叅將 李如梅, 李如梧(兩李는 如松의 弟)楊紹, 先鋒副摠兵査大受, 孫受廉, 叅將 李寧, 遊擊 葛逢夏 等을 통솔하고 副摠兵 李如栢은 中協大將으로 副摠兵 任自强, 叅將 李芳春, 遊擊 高策, 錢世楨, 적金, 周弘模, 方時輝, 高昇, 王問等을 통솔하고 부총병 張世覓은 右協大將으로 祖承訓(以兵敗故로 充兵하야 白衣自校함) 副摠兵 吳惟忠, 王必迪, 叅將 趙之牧, 張應和, 駱尙志, 陳邦哲, 遊擊 谷遂, 梁心 等을 統率하고 叅將 方時春은 中軍備禦, 韓宗功 李逢陽은 旗鼓官, 兵部員外郞 劉黃裳, 兵部主事 袁黃은 贊畵, 戶部主事 艾維新은 督餉을 任하야 明帝의 勅詔로 陪道馳援할 事를 命하고 또 遊擊 張奇功을 特差하야 金銀 馬粮 等을 運搬하야 義州에 至케하니 勇將이 凡六十餘員이엿다. 그러나 如松은 通遠堡까지 이르러서 留屯不進하고 應昌과 黃裳은 遼東에 任하야 諸將을 절제하며 시세를 관망하니 朝鮮의 정부에서는 극히 焦悶하야 다시 執義 李好閔을 보내서 事勢의 위급한 것과 적의 急擊勿失할 事를 言하니 如松이 정월에 進兵할 事를 언명하얏스나 오히려 躊躇하고 진군치 안이하니 조정은 다시 史判 李山甫를 보내서, 急救할 事를 言하매 辭氣가 懇曲하고 말할때마다 눈물이 隨下하니 如松이 또한 그 義에 感하야 遂히 12월 22일에 錢世楨으로＜2＞ 南兵 삼천을 率하고 먼저 鴨綠江을 건너게 하고 如松은 同 24일에 隨하야 강을 건너니 旗旌이 천리에 뻐 치고 金鼓가 산하를 진동하며 是日에 白虹이 日을 貫하고 日에 右弧가 出射하니 如松이 크게 깃버하야 諸軍에게 필승의 兆를 말하고 朝鮮의 군신상하는 大旱에 甘雨를 만난 것보다 더 깃버하야 沿路마다 성대한 환영을 하엿다.

李如松의 爲人
李如松은 호는 仰誠이니 寧遠伯 李成樑의 아들이다. 그의 조부는 원래 朝鮮사람으로 平北渭原에 살더니 禿魯江 부근에서 잇던 사건으로 살인을 하고 夫妻가 도망하야 遼東 鐵寧衛에서 살엇는데 邊功으로 遊擊이 되엿더니 其子 成樑이 또한 무예가 절륜하야 누차 邊功을 세워 險山堡叅將이 되엿다가 不過 數年에 또 大功이 잇서 摠兵이 되매 천리의 地를 拓하고 五堡를 立하니 勳이 伯爵에 陞하얏다. 成樑의 子 如松, 如樟, 如栢, 如梅, 如梧, 如楨 六人은 다 당대 용장으로 俱히 摠兵에 至하고 그 외 婿侄의 고관된 자 또한 10여인에 달하니 그 문호의 혁혁함이 唐의 郭汾陽과 相似하다고 세인이 칭찬하고 如松의 母 宿氏는 또한 여자 豪傑호서 명성이 쟁쟁하엿다. 때에 如松이 십만의 대병으로 寧夏賊 劉東暢, 李承恩 등을 파멸하고 아즉 班師도 안이하야 明帝가 또한 朝鮮救援의 命을 下하니 如松이 初에 병고로 辭코자 하얏스나 그 母 宿氏가 朝鮮이 자기의 母國인 것을 懇切히 말하며 警戒하니 如松이 또한 감동하야 慨然이 출사하얏다. 그때에 如松은 몸에 紅錦를 입고 紅明轎에 나려서 宣朝大王을 義順館에서 拜見하니 宣祖는 一見에 大喜하야 그의 원정한 勞와 明帝의 隣國救援하는 덕을 謝하고 繼하야 東國의 一縷生命이 如松에게 잇다는 것을 말하니 如松은 우서 갈오되 이것은 다 우리 皇帝의 威德과 朝鮮國王의 洪福으로 賊을 사멸하게 되는 것이니 나에게 무슨 과도의 謝勞가 잇스리요 하고 且日外臣은 본래 朝鮮사람인 까닭에 출정할 때에도 부모가 친히 嚴戒를 하얏스니 내 비록 몸을 희생한들 엇지 朝鮮을 저버리리요 하고 禮容이 심히 공손하고 언어가 유창하니 朝鮮의 上下가 매우 깃버하며 또한 厚遇하엿다.

提兵星夜到江干
且說 李如松이 義州를 떠나 平壤으로 향하니 군병이 4,5만에 달하고 군량이 8만석, 화약이 2만근에 至하니 軍容의 整整함과 威風의 堂堂함은 실로 天下無敵의 感이 잇섯다. 安州에 이르러서 淸川江邊에 留陣하니 柳成龍이 如松을 마저 드려 安州郡 衙東軒에 座定케 하고 平壤의 지도를 袖中에서 出하야 지세를 명시하고 또 군병의 진로를 지시하니 如松이 成龍의 高見을 歎服傾聽하고 朱筆로 要害의 處를 표하며 갈오되 倭는 但히 鳥銃을 持賴하되 我는 대포가 有하야 위력이 능리 5,6리를 통하니 적이 엇지 능당하리오 하더라. 成龍이 이미 퇴거하매 如松은 다시 一首의 詩를 寄하야 成龍에게 其 志를 示하니 其 詩에 曰
「提兵星夜到江干, 爲說三韓國未安. 明主日懸旋節報, 微臣夜釋酒盃歡, 着來殺氣心猶壯, 比去妖氣骨巳寒. 談笑敢言非勝策, 夢中尙跨憶征鞍」이라 하엿더라.
癸巳春 2월10일(정월 초1일)이엿다. 如松은 査大受를 順安倭營에 보내서 紿하야 갈오되 明國이 이미 和를 許하고 沈遊擊惟敬이 또한 온다하니 (先是에 祖承訓敗後에 明의 沈惟敬이＜3＞ 日使 玄蘇(僧)와 화의를 논하고 50일간을 서로 휴전하고 갓스니 이는 明의 緩兵策이다) 日使 玄蘇가 크게 깃버하야 시를 送하되 「扶桑息戰服中華, 四海九州同一家. 喜氣還消寫外雪, 乾坤春早太平花一라 운운하고 그 小將平好官으로 20여 騎를 率하고 惟敬을 順安館에 迎하니 이것은 玄蘇가 如松의 計에 빠짐이엇다. 大受는 平好官의 일행 수십만을 館中에서 留飮하다가 醉中을 乘하야 伏兵으로 一時擊殺하니 3인이 겨우 逃去하야 사실을 報하매 적이 비로소 明兵의 大至함을 알고 크게 驚動하야 乘夜逃走하얏다. 대군이 肅川에 이르러 夕飯을 맛치자 順安勝利의 報가 至하니 如松이 義氣躍動하야 弓紈를 울리며 馬上에 馳坐하야 數騎와 가티 順安으로 直向하니 諸營의 兵이 감히 留宿치 못하고 陸續進發하야 疾風迅雷的으로 6일 早朝에 平壤城에 도달하니 그때까지 적이 明군의 至함을 알지 못하고 都元師 이하 조선의 제 병영도 平壤을 향하야 진군하얏다. (先是에 적이 朝鮮人의 無賴輩를 金紈으로 買收하야 安州, 義州, 順安 등의 군사를 哨深하다가 安州에서 事가 발각되야 其中 한 者를 梟首嚴訓하니 餘輩가 다시 감히 異志를 먹지 못하고 이로 인하야 적은 哨深이 杜絶되야 明兵의 到來를 全然不知하얏다).

天飜地覆의 平壤激戰
初8일(2월 17일) 早朝에 如松은 諸軍에게 傳食을 마치고 三營의 將校로 더부러 군병을 논아서 七星, 普通, 含毬三門 밧게 陣을 列하고 북을 치며 라팔을 불고 戰을 挑하니 적이 城上에 白線의 旗를 羅列하고 拒戰하는지라. 如松은 怒氣가 奮發하야 친히 手兵 數百騎를 거나리고 城下에 肉迫하야 諸將을 指揮하며 俄然히 大砲를 發하고 諸陣이 일시에 應하야 또 砲를 發하니 聲이 천지를 진동하고 화염이 天을 衝하야 수십여리가 黑夜와 가티 晦冥하고 烈火猛風은 城內를 直衝하야 密德의 土窟(卽土堡)이 먼저 燒破되고 다른 土窟도 延하야 燒盡하니 如松이 이에 諸軍을 鼓勵하야 直히 城을 乘越할 새 敵이 鳥銃과 大石을 亂雨와 가티 射하니 其勢가 심히 猛烈하야 死者가 자못 만홈으로 明軍이 少退하는지라. 如松은 친히 紈을 拔하야 退하는 병사 1인을 立斬하고 挻身直前하야 軍中에 大呼하야 曰, 먼저 登城하는 者는 賞銀 오십량를 준다 하니 駱尙志가 含毬門을 從하야 손에 長戟을 가지며 腋에 大砲를 끼고 몸으로 數丈을 솟사 제 1인으로 城에 登하고 吳惟忠이 또한 뒤를 이여 城에 올으니(兩將은 다 南方의 人이니 駱은 원래 勇力이 絶倫한 고로 軍中에서 駱千斤이라 號하얏다.) 諸軍이 북을 치고 蟻羣과 가티 달녀 올나가며 浙江의 兵은 紅衣를 着하고 城에 올나 敵旗를 뽑고 明兵의 旗幟를 세우니 적이 神兵으로 疑하고 望風敗去 하얏다. 如松은 또 張世爵으로 더부러 七星門을 칠새 대포로 門樓를 破碎하고 兵을 整하야 드러가고 李如栢은 含毬門으로 楊元은 普通門으로 乘勝爭追하며 騎兵은 또 뒤를 이여 드러오니 그 勢가 怒潮洪波와 가터서 적이 敢拒치 못하고 逃入하야 內城을 保하엿다. 이에 明兵은 일제이 입성하야 다시 內城을 공겊�하니 이 內城은 土堡를 만히 設하고 孔穴을 多數하게 穿하야 望見하매 蜂巢와 갓고 穴中을 從하쓀¼ 亂丸을 放하니 明兵이 多傷하는지라 如松은 窮敵을 攻擊하는 것은 도로혀 不利로 생각하고 군을 收하야 城外에 退陣한 후 前日에 投敵하엿던 浙江 張大膳을 募得하야 賊營에 가서 說諭하야 曰 我의 병력으로 족히 爾等을 진멸하겟스되 人命을 위하야 참아 진멸치 못하고＜4＞ 一條의 生路를 開하야주니 속히 퇴거하라 하니 行長이 後路의 *斷치 안을 事를 請하야 서로 약속하고 夜間을 타서 逃去하니 이에 平壤이 회복되고 中和黃州의 적도 또한 逃去하얏다. 이 戰役에 日兵의 死者는 일천이백오십오級, 馬匹의 收穫는 이천구백팔십오匹, 軍器는 사만오천이件이며 朝鮮의 逋*虜奪還은 남녀-천십오인이고 明兵의 死者가 또한 적지 안엇다. 때에 如松은 가만이 李寧, 祖承訓 등을 要路에 理伏하얏다가 패주하는 적을 襲擊하야 삼백오십級을 斬하고 또 二口를 生擒하니 行長, 義智, 玄蘇, 調信등이 餘衆을 率하고 南을 향하야 도주하는데 기력이 乏盡하고 兩足이 傷*하야 匐匐行路하는 자가 만흐며 양식이 乏絶하야 민간으로 乞食까지 하는 窮境에 빠젓섯다. 그러나 要路에 設伏하얏던 黃海 防禦使 李時言, 金敬老 등은 감히 추적치 못하고 그저 自衛만 하다가 적이 過去한 뒤에 비로소 砲를 發하야 위협할 뿐이더라. 이것은 당시에 누구나 痛罵치 안이치 못하얏다.

平壤 戰捷과 朝鮮의 形勢
이 平壤의 戰捷은 明軍의 최대 성공으로 旣盡한 朝鮮의 운명을 다시 挽回하엿다. 如松은 平壤 戰捷 후로 驕氣橫溢하야 朝鮮의 군신 상하를 여지업시 蔑視하고 또 輕賊의 결과로 碧蹄에서 참패를 당하고 다시 平壤에 퇴진하야 감히 南進치 못하얏스나 이 戰捷은 朝鮮에 막대한 影響을 주엇다. 당시에 如松이 만일 祖承訓 史儒 등과 가티 또 패하얏다면 적이 반듯시 龍灣을 直衝하야 宣祖로 하야금 鴨緣以西의 異國孤地로 播越케 하얏슬 터이오 따러서 朝鮮의 인심이 아주 離散하고 明의 後援軍도 다시 更來할 용기가 업서서 畢景 삼천리 神州가 적에 蹂躪이 되고 말엇슬 것이다. 그러나 天祐神助로 이 平壤의 大捷이 잇슨 결과 朝鮮의 一般은 다 匡復의 용기와 大志를 가지게 되야 각지 勤王의 兵이 벌떼와 가티 이러나며 2월 3일(陽3월13일)에는 都元師 權慄이 幸州를 大捷하고 繼하야 國都 京城이 회복되며 明軍이 또한 南下하고 李舜臣이 閒山 鷺梁의 海戰에 大捷하야 遂히 朝鮮을 광복하얏다. 摠而言之하면 壬辰亂 때에 북의 平壤과 남의 閒山島 해전은 당시 여러 전쟁 중 가장 격렬한 것으로 가장 대성공을 하야 朝鮮의 宗社와 生靈을 보전케 하얏다. 忠武公은 물론 당시 朝鮮에 유일한 충신이닛가 말할 것도 업거니와 李如松도 그 祖先이 원래 朝鮮 사람인 까닭에 남유달리 부모의 嚴戒가 잇섯고 그도 또한 부모의 戒訓을 잘 바더서 徹頭徹尾하게 朝鮮의 援助에 盡瘁한 것이다. 그로 보면 민족의 피란 것은 참으로 泛然이 생각지 못할 것이다. 그 뒤 明이 망한 후에 如松 如梅 등 兄弟의 자손이 다시 朝鮮에 망명하야 世居한 것을 보면 그 엇지 尋常한 일이라 하랴.＜5＞
