Horse Ballad

The horse is the essence of the Fang star (房星) among the 28 constellations, corresponding to the hour of the Horse (午) in the sexagenary cycle, belonging to fire (火) in the Five Elements, and belonging to the South (南) in the Five Directions. The origin of Korean horses is uncertain, but according to Yi Mok-eun's (李牧隱) collection in Goryeo, there are two types of horses in Korea: one is the native horse (鄕馬), produced in the country, and the other is the barbarian horse (胡馬), which came from the north. Yu Deuk-gong's Kyoto Miscellaneous Records (京都雜記) states that there are various kinds of horses in Korea: red horses are called Jeolda (截多), chestnut horses are called Gurang (句郞), reddish-yellow horses are called Buru (夫婁), black horses are called Gara (加羅), yellow horses are called Gonggul (公鶻), black-maned yellow horses are called Gora (高羅), blue-gray horses are called Gariun (加里溫), and green-faced horses are called Ganja (間者), all of which are said to have originated from the Manchu language. However, its origin is still unknown, and the earliest record in the official history is that in the first year of King Hyeokgeose of Silla, Dong-Okjeo presented 24 fine horses (良馬), and again in the 50th year, Dong-Okjeo presented 200 fine horses. (See below) In Japan, the first record is that Baekje sent one male and one female fine horse to Emperor Ōjin in the 15th year of his reign. There are also many references to horses in Chinese records. In the Zhou Rituals (周官), a horse over eight feet tall is called a dragon (龍), over seven feet is called Rai (騋), and six feet is called a horse (馬). He Chengtian's Zuanwen (何承天纂文) states that a one-year-old horse is called Ma (馬), a two-year-old horse is called Gu (駒), and an eight-year-old horse is called * (asterisk in original). Shiyiji (拾遺記) states that King Mu of Zhou had eight great steeds: the first is Juedi (絶地), whose feet do not touch the ground; the second is Fanyu (翻羽), who travels beyond flying birds; the third is Benxiao (奔宵), who travels ten thousand li at night; the fourth is Chaojing (超影), who chases the sun; the fifth is Yuhui (踰輝), whose coat is bright; the sixth is Chaoguang (超光), who has one form and ten shadows; the seventh is Tengwu (騰霧), who rides on clouds; and the eighth is Guayi (掛翼), who has fleshy wings on his body. Cui Bao's Notes on Ancient and Modern Times (崔豹 古今註) states that Qin Shi Huang had seven famous horses: Zhuifeng (追風), Baitao (白兎), Nieying (躡景), Zhuiadian (追電), Feihe (飛翮), Tongque (銅雀), and Chenfu (晨鳧). The Analects (論語) states that "a steed (驥) is praised for its virtue, not its strength," and "when the stable burned down (廐焚), Confucius asked about the people, not the horses." Furthermore, Duke Jing of Qi had a thousand four-horse chariots (千駟), Aemun Gong had three and a half * of Rai mares, Qin Shi Huang also had Xianli horses, Xiang Yu had the black horse Wuzhui, Guan Yu had the red rabbit horse, and Liu Xuan-deok had the Dilu horse. Hualiu (驊騮), Qiji (騏驥), Xianli (纖離), and Luyu (騄駬) are ancient fine horses (Xunzi), Longmei (龍媒) and Yaoniao (騕裊) are names of swift horses, and Nudai (駑駘) and Kuanjia (款叚) are names of weak horses (Classified Citations). The Zhou Rituals (周官) states that in spring, sacrifices are offered to the Horse Ancestor (馬祖), who is the first ancestor of horses, namely the Heavenly Colt (天駒); in summer, sacrifices are offered to the First Herdsman (先牧), who was the first to raise horses; in autumn, sacrifices are offered to the Horse Society (馬社), which is the first to ride horses; and in winter, sacrifices are offered to the Horse Step (馬步), which is the disaster of horses. Zhuangzi said, "bridle the horse's head (絡馬首)," and Ma Yuan said, "a great man should wrap his body in horsehide (馬革) after death." Cao Mengde said, "an old steed in the stable still aspires to travel a thousand li (老驥伏櫪志在千里)." "A long whip cannot reach the horse's belly (長鞭不及馬腹)" comes from the Zuo Zhuan, "an ox and a steed eat from the same trough (牛驥同皀)" is in the Book of Han, and the Record of Rites states, "worn curtains are not discarded for the sake of burying the horse (弊帷不棄)." The History of the Later Han Dynasty says, "horses are like swimming dragons (馬如遊龍)." In the Book of Odes, "bright white colt (皎皎白駒)" satirizes King Xuan, and "grazing horses in the fields (坰野牧馬＜118＞)" praises Duke Xi. Duke Huan of Qi lost his way on the return journey after attacking Guzhu, and followed the old horse according to Guan Zhong's plan to find it. Duke Mu of Qin gave wine to those who stole his horses, and the thief followed and died in battle when Qin attacked Jin to repay his kindness. After King Wu of Zhou conquered Yin, he released the horses on the south side of Mount Hua, and Bo Yi and Shu Qi stopped the horses and remonstrated. King Zhuang of Chu intended to bury his beloved horse with the rites of a minister but stopped after You Meng's satire. In the Records of the Warring States, Guo Wei told King Zhao of Yan, "A chamberlain bought a dead horse's bones for five hundred gold, and within a year, three thousand-li horses arrived." Bo Le was good at judging horses, and once he looked at a horse, its price tripled. Jiu Fanggao, Zao Fu, Wang Liang, and Han Ai were also good at driving horses. Tian Zifang saw the old horse of the public family abandoned in the field and continued its life with bundles of silk, and poor scholars heard of it and were greatly moved. Emperor Wen of Han returned the thousand-li horse, and when the King of Liang fell from his horse, Jia Yi considered it his fault and always cried until he died a year later.

In the second year of Yuanshou (元狩) of the Han Dynasty, a horse was born in the Yuwu River, and in the fourth year of Yuanding (元鼎), a horse was born in the Wowa River. The Dayuan Kingdom had fine horses, and the Han Dynasty sought them for a thousand gold, but because they did not give them, Li Guangli attacked the Ershi City of Dayuan and took the fine horses. Horse dung is horse manure (Zuo Zhuan), horse armor is the armor worn by horses (Five Dynasties History), and horse clothing is a felt woven garment (Mencius Commentary). The Miao people call unmarried men Ma Lang (馬郞), and Ma Liu is the name of a southern barbarian tribe, said to be descendants of Ma Yuan's soldiers during his southern campaign. Matou Niang (馬頭娘), or Ma Ming Wang (馬明王), is the silkworm god, Ma Han is the name of the sea god (Mu Hua Fu), Ma Bi is the name of a Han currency (Book of Han, Treatise on Food and Goods), and the exposed part of the mulberry root above ground is called Ma E (馬額), which is poisonous and can kill people (Compendium of Materia Medica). The horse tax is called Ma Kou Qian (馬口錢), and the shape of the tomb mound is like a horse's mane, so the tomb is called Ma Lie Feng (馬鬣封) (Record of Rites). When Xiahou Ying died and was buried outside the East Gate, the four horses would not move, so when they dug the ground, there was an inscription on the stone coffin that said, "A beautiful city, lush for three thousand years; seeing the white sun, alas, Teng Gong dwells in this room," hence it was named the Horse Tomb. During the time of Fu Xi, a river horse emerged carrying a diagram, so Fu Xi saw it and began to draw the Eight Trigrams. When Prince Dan of Yan entered Qin as a hostage, it was said that he would only return when a horse grew horns. Zhao Gao pointed at a deer and called it a horse, so later, foolish deeds were called Ma Lu (馬鹿), and the Japanese word "baka" (馬鹿) is derived from this. Not listening to others' words is called Ma Er Dong Feng (馬耳東風), and Li Bai's poem says, "The world shakes their heads when they hear this, like the east wind blowing in a horse's ear." When General Zhao Gu's fine horse died, Guo Pu revived it with extraordinary skills. Because An Lushan was so obese, when he entered the court, the horse would die if he did not change horses midway, so the place where Lushan changed horses was called the Great Man's Horse Changing Platform. Emperor Xuanzong of Tang gave colorful clothes to a hundred horses and taught them to dance, which was called the Horse Dance. Liu Sanfu said he was the reincarnation of a horse, and during the Yuanding era of the Han Dynasty, the Zhizhi Kingdom offered a horse liver stone, which would turn white hair black when rubbed on the hair. When King Ji of Jin crossed the water, he always rode a horse, so Du Yu said he had a horse addiction. Because a man from the border gained a horse, his son broke his thigh, and because of the broken thigh, he avoided the calamity of war, so later generations called the impermanence of fortune and misfortune Saiweng's Loss of a Horse. The King of Wu killed Wu Zixu and threw him into the sea, and the White Horse Tide arose. Because Yanzi saw a horse in Wumen and called it "a piece of silk (一疋練)" (referring to the horse's color and appearance), later generations called a horse "a piece of silk＜119＞." As for works, Li Bo Le has the Physiognomy of Horses (相馬篇), Han Yu discusses horses in Miscellaneous Sayings (雜說), Liu Yuxi has Treatise on Steeds (驥說), Qin Xiaoyou wrote Preface to the Eight骏图, Du Fu has Painting Horse Praise and Zong Ma Xing (贊驄馬行), and Su Zidan has Nine Horses 圖贊, Emperor Wu of Han has Song of the Celestial Horse (天馬歌), Song of the Wowa Divine Horse, Cen Shen has Song of the Red Roan Horse, and Li Bai has Song of the Celestial Horse. Li Bai also exchanged the five-flower horse (五花馬) wrapped in a thousand gold for fine wine and called for a concubine with a thousand-gold steed. Qin Er Shi said, "A hundred years of life is like a white colt passing through a crack (人生百年如白駒過隙)," so time is also called Baiju Guangyin (白駒光陰). The idea is like a horse moving, so there is the saying "意馬," and there are also the sayings "Wind, horses, and cattle do not affect each other (風馬牛不相及)," and "Three horses in the same trough (三馬同槽)."

There was also a case of giving a horse a nickname. Sima Xiu of Jin was spared death by the enemy because of his horse, so he gave his horse the title Yangwu (揚武). Liu Min of the Eastern Han Dynasty saved his life because of his horse in battle, so he called his horse the Free General (自在將軍), and gave it the food allowance of a third-rank official and gold and silver decorations. Emperor Huizong of Song gave his horse the title Dragon-Rising General (龍驤將軍), and Alexander the Great buried his beloved horse Bucephalus after its death and established a shrine to worship it, and named the cave Bucephalus. Three swift mares who won the Olympic competition in Greece also had temples built after their death, and Roman Emperor Caligula gave his beloved horse Incitatus a mansion and servants. Romans consider dragonflies to be the horses of nightmares. Oh, I almost forgot. Yao Yu of Song named his horse Azure Lion (靑獅子). When the Jin soldiers invaded, all the generals and soldiers fled, but only Yao Yu and his horse fought to the end and died heroically, so the court established a temple for him. Someone wrote a poem:
With a loyal heart, he dedicated himself to the country in peacetime, and did not hesitate to sacrifice his body when facing the enemy.
Quan Ji and Gao Yong (Gao refers to the division commander Dai Gao) all fled, only the Azure Lion died heroically at the same time.

Korean Customs and Slang Related to Horses

Today, with the implementation of vaccination, smallpox, or "mama" as it is called, is something that young people hardly know the name of. However, in the past, when smallpox was prevalent, there was a superstition of "sending off smallpox" and making straw horses (싸리말) to drive away the plague ghost, so even driving people out came to be called "riding a straw horse." Also, if there are many equestrian stars (驛馬星) in one's Four Pillars (四柱), it is said that one travels a lot to foreign lands. Seeing a horse in a dream is said to be the activation of the City God (城隍神), so there is a superstition of holding a City God festival. It is said that a premature colt (지난말색기) is feared by goblins (독갑이), so if you bring that premature colt to a house where goblins reside, the goblins will disappear. If a grave is placed in a location shaped like a thirsty horse drinking water (渴馬飮水形), the descendants will become rich and noble. If you catch a cold, you draw three horses on white paper, prepare rice, and throw it away. During wedding processions, the groom must ride a white horse (that was the way it used to be). On the day of Ipchun (立春, Beginning of Spring), auspicious writings such as "Horses travel a thousand li (馬行千里路)," "Horses are like dragons traveling a thousand li (馬如遊龍行千里)," and "* mares are three thousand (＊牝三千)" are attached to the pillars of the stable. In front of shrines of past sages and other ancestral shrines, warning signs are erected saying "All personnel, large and small, must dismount (大小人員皆下馬)." In the summer, when reading five-character Tang poems, the line "Meeting Hanshik on horseback (馬上逢寒食)" from Du Shenyan's poem is read first (this too, of course, is from the past). If you fall from a horse or get kicked by a horse, the wound is cauterized with horsehair. When playing janggi (Korean chess), if the horse enters the palace (馬入宮中), it is said that defeat is certain. If there is a white spot on the face of a horse, it is said to harm the owner.

In the past, the Jeju female entertainers (妓生) were skilled in horsemanship, and because Jeju had pastures since the Mongol period and produced many horses, this kind of custom existed. There are two poems in Seokbuk Shin Gwang-su's Collection (石北申光洙集) about Jeju female entertainers riding horses in the city, as follows:
Jeju maidens ride horses in men's attire, their elegance filling the teaching quarters.
With a single golden whip, they ride over the vast sea, circling the stone city thrice amidst the spring grass.
They compete for mandarins and pomelos in every alley, uniquely walking with steeds in every field.
If you teach them to go north with delicate eyebrows, they will marry Yu Lin Lang early for a thousand gold.
The pond is deep, with a bright moon in the harbor; spring is dark, with green * in the city. Official entertainers can tame horses, and sailors do not fear whales.
Records of literature and local customs, flower, bird, and moon morning reviews ＜120＞ Knowing the naval defense general, coming to comfort guests from time to time.

The female entertainers of Uiju also had the skills of riding horses and dancing with swords. Because Uiju was an important place for national defense, this custom was prevalent. In the 93rd of Gwanseo Akbu (關西樂府) in the Seokbuk Collection, there is also such a poem:
In the deep autumn of Wi-hwa, the grasses and trees are level, the wind and rain hunt the military procession. Female entertainers with embroidered clothes, gongs, songs, bows, and arrows, all ride * horses into the city. (Wi-hwa is an island located at the mouth of the Yalu River)
Also, in the records of the female poet Kim Cham-pan Deok-hui's concubine, Kim Geum-won Yeosa (金錦園 女史), there are three poems about Uiju female entertainers riding horses (written when Kim Gong went to Uiju as a prefect):
The dragon city's painted horns cannot overcome spring, the river willows and river flowers are all new colors.
The court is quiet during the day, the courtyard is overgrown with grass, the moon arrives late at night, and the seat is free of dust.
Light shirts and precious socks, the female entertainer throws the pot, the golden belt and coral dance swords for the guests.
The red rain covers a thousand li of Yansan Road, the star carriage arrives, receiving the king's grace.
The strategic advantage of Gwanha is this tower, where the horse's ears turn blue to guard the Yalu River.
Six paths of stars are scattered, connecting to the farthest harbor, ten thousand mountains are arranged like a chessboard, embracing the western province.
Clear sand and ancient trees amidst desolate ramparts, misty rain, cold snow, and the vast desert autumn.
Leaning on the railing, the beacon is lit, the torches fill the river, a plan for peace.
People dressed up and horses adorned, together exquisitely, standing on the tower, red teams in rows.
Three drumbeats sound, flying like a storm, fragrant dust is unharmed, a hundred flower wind.

Even now, the female entertainers of Pyongyang are good at singing Gwanseon Rongma (關山戎馬). Gwanseon Rongma is what is said in Shin Gwang-su's "Climbing Mt. Ak and Lamenting Gwanseon Rongma," a gongnyeong poem: "The fish and dragons are lonely, the autumn river is cold, people are in the Zhongxuan Tower in the west wind, plum blossoms in all countries listen to the evening flute, peach and bamboo in their twilight years follow the white crows..." and so on, 36 lines. Because Shin Gong's poem was widely discussed in his generation, even the female entertainers memorized and sang it as a song. According to Seokbuk Collection, the first person to sing this poem was the Pyongyang female entertainer Mokdan. At that time, Seokbuk listened to Mokdan's singing and wrote three playful poems for her:
The white-haired Dan-gi enters the Han capital, her clear song can amaze ten thousand people.
The Gwanseon melody at Nyeonggwangjeong (練光亭), why do I hear the old sound tonight? (Gong heard this song when he traveled west in the past, and now he hears it again, hence the saying)
Under the clear stream wall, the magnolia boat, how many times have I heard the water chestnut song while playing?
The Chang'an of ten thousand households, the moon tonight, is pitifully still like the autumn of the Daedong River.
The Pear Garden's South Tower, Gwangtong Bridge, is only a short distance away from the immortal face.
I hear that the song is as good as ever, but the color has faded to this day.
According to Park Jang-won's Collection (久堂集), the female entertainers of Bukcheong also had the skill of riding horses. At that time, the old female entertainer of Bukcheong, Gyeongseon, was the owner when Yi O-seong was exiled. She was skilled at riding horses in her youth, and when she came to the capital at the age of seventy-three, a playful poem was written for her, it is said.
You were once young and able to ride a horse, gambling to win the poem in exile from O-seong.
Meeting you today, talking about the past, the heroic spirit on the saddle has not completely faded.
There are many sayings about horses in slang, but to mention a few:
Even a fast horse needs a whip (走馬加鞭).
Even the Yiju baebal horse poops blood.
Even an old horse likes beans.
Isn't the horse-riding husband far away?
A dark horse travels well.
If you ride a horse, you want to bring in a bell.
Covering up is horse dung on a mosquito's butt.
If you value your wife, you value the horse post at your wife's house.
Fixing the barn after losing the horse.
Send the horse's foal to the mountains.
Which way does the Jeju horse's mane grow, to the left or the right?
Even a horse-slaughtering house has salt.
Even a colt knows four inches.
The Jeju horse bites its own mane.
Horse-dung head.
Even if you roll in horse dung, it's good to be alive.
Like taming a wild horse.
Putting something to be carried on a horse's back on a flea's back.
Adorning the tail of a blue horse.
If the horse's rein is long, it gets stepped on.
A fly on a horse's tail travels a thousand li.
A sieve merchant at the place where a horse died.
People and horses are the same, bamboo horses deliberately, ox urine and horse spleen.
In addition, there are also various folk songs, but to mention a few that I know:
In the Arirang ballad, there are the lines "Mun-gyeong Saejae mulberry trees, all made of horse-chae and cow-chae..." "The horse wants to go, but only the bells jingle, holding the lover, I only say 'nakdu-natdu.'" And in the lullaby, there is the line "The three-year-old horsehide is rolling and shaking, coming over there..." (To be continued in the next issue) ＜121＞

馬에 관한 朝鮮의 風俗 及 俚語歌謠
種痘가 실시된 오늘에는 소위 天然痘 즉 마마라는 것은 젊은 사람으로서는 이름도 잘 모르게 되엿스나 前日에 마마가 유행할 때에는 소위 마마를 配送식힌다 하고 싸리말을 맨드러 疫鬼를 逐送하는 미신이 잇는 까닭에 사람을 逐出하는 것도 속칭 싸리말를 태운다는 말까지 생겻다. 그리고 四柱에 驛馬星이 만이 들면 客地로 만히 도라다닌다 하고, 꿈에 말을 보면 城隍神이 發動하는 것이라 하야 城隍祭를 지내는 미신이 잇스며, 지난말색기(産期 未滿 전에 生한 것)는 독갑이(魍魎鬼)가 무서워하는 까닭에 독갑이 잇는 집에서 그 말색기를 갓다두면 독갑이가 다러난다 하고, 渴馬飮水形으로 된 묘지에 묘를 쓰면 자손이 富貴한다 하며, 감기가 들면 白紙에 三馬를 그려서 밥을 해 내버리고, 婚行에는 신랑이 반듯시 白馬를 타며(그것도 前날 일), 立春날에는 馬廐 지둥에 馬行千里路, 馬如遊龍行千里, *牝三千 등의 祝書를 부치고, 先賢의 祀廟 기타 宗廟 前에는 『大小人員皆下馬』의 警告碑를 세운다. 여름에는 五言唐音을 읽되 別杜審言題의 馬上逢寒食 句를 먼저 읽으며(이것도 물론 前날 일), 말에 떠러지거나 말에 채이면 그 상처를 馬毛로 지지고, 將碁를 둘 때에 馬入 宮中이면 必敗라 言하며, 馬의 面上에 白點이 잇스면 주인을 害한다 한다.

前日에 濟州 妓生은 走馬技를 能行하얏스니 濟州는 원래 蒙古 때부터 牧場을 두어 産馬가 만홈으로 風俗에도 이런 것이 잇섯던 것이다. 石北申光洙集에 濟州城觀妓走馬詩 二篇이 잇는데 如下하다.
男裝走馬濟州娘, 燕趙風流滿敎坊.
一擧金鞭滄海上, 三回春草石城傍,
爭朝橘柚家家巷, 獨步驊騮處處場.
敎着蛾眉北方去, 千金早嫁羽林郞.등
池深明月浦, 春暗綠＠城, 官妓能調馬 船人不畏鯨,
文章風土記, 花鳥月朝評＜120＞ 知海防禦將, 時來慰客情.

義州의 妓가 또한 馳馬 舞釰의 技가 잇섯스니 義州는 國防重地인 까닭에 此 風이 유행한 것이다. 石北集의 關西樂府 第九十三에 또한 이러한 詩가 잇다.
威化深秋草樹平, 風毛雨雪獵軍行, 繡服鐃歌弓箭妓, 皆騎*馬入州城. (威化는 島名이니 在鴨綠江口)
又 女流詩人 金叅判 德熙의 妾 金錦園 女史 所記에도 義州觀妓走馬詩 三篇이 잇스니 (金 公이 以府尹으로 赴義州時 所作)
龍城畵角不勝春 江柳江花色色新.
晝靜官閒庭自草 夜深月到座無塵.
輕衫寶襪投壺妓 金帶珊瑚舞釰賓.
紅雨燕山千里路 星軺來到荷君恩.
關河形勝最斯樓 馬耳靑來鎭鴨頭.
六道星羅通極浦 萬山棊置擁西州.
晴沙古木中荒堞 暝霧寒雪大漠秋.
徙倚闌于烽點罷 滿江戌火太平籌.
人粧馬飾共玲瓏 立立樓頭隊隊紅.
撾鼓三聲飛也似 香塵無恙百花風.

平壤 妓는 지금까지도 關山戎馬를 善唱하니 關山戎馬란 것은 申光洙의 「登岳陽樓하야 歎關山戎馬란 功令詩에 所謂, 魚龍寂寞秋江冷, 人在西風仲宣樓, 梅花萬國聽暮笛, 桃竹殘年隨白鴉... ...」 등 36句다. 申公의 此詩가 一世에 회자한 까닭에 기생까지 가요로 傳誦한 것이니 石北集에 의하면 此詩를 최초로 唱한 者는 平壤妓 牧丹인데 당시 石北이 이 詩唱을 듯고 牧丹에게 戱贈한 詩가 三首가 잇다.
頭白丹姬入漢京 淸歌能使萬人驚.
練光亭上關山曲 今夜何因聽舊聲.(公이 前日 西遊時 聞此歌而其時復聞 故로 云)
淸流壁下木蘭舟 憶聽菱歌幾度遊.
萬戶長安今夕月 可憐猶似浿江秋.
梨園南樓廣通橋 咫尺仙顔弱水遙.
聽說歌聲依舊好 祗令顔色到今凋.
朴長遠 久堂集에 의하면 北靑 妓가 또한 馳馬의 技가 잇섯는데 당시 北靑 老妓가 慶仙은 李鰲城 謫居時 主人인데 少時에 馳馬에 能하다가 七十三에 京城에 來함으로 一首의 詩를 戱贈하얏다 云하얏다.
爾曾年少能騎馬 賭取鰲翁謫裏詩.
此日相逢談昔事 據鞍豪氣未全衰.
