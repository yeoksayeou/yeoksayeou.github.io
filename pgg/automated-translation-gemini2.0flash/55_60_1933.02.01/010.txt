New Year's Folk Songs, Moon Gazing Song

When the Great Full Moon
of the New Year arrives,
the people of the farming village
gaze at the moon.
If it leans toward the north,
the mountain valleys will have a good harvest,
if it leans toward the south,
the seaside will have a good harvest.

If the moonlight is red,
there will be a great drought,

if the moonlight is white,
there will be a great flood.

If you want to know a great harvest,
you must look at the round and yellow one.

-Original Poem-

Farmers gaze at the moon in the first month,
Observing the moon rising in the sky.

If it's close to the north, the mountain valleys are abundant,
If it leans to the south, the seaside is rich.

Red is suspected of withered grass and trees,
White is feared of rising deep waters.

If it's round, full, and deep yellow,
Then we know there will be a great year.
(The original work by Ch'a Ch'ang-yŏn, a scholar of Yi studies during the reign of King Sŏnjo)＜2＞

舊正俗謠, 望月謠
正月에 大보름이
도라오면은
農村의 사람들이
달마지하네.
北으로 닥어 뜨면
山陜 풍년들고
南으로 기으치면
海邊 풍년드네.

달빗이 붉으며은
큰 감을 들고

달빗이 희면은
대홍수 난다.

그중에 큰 풍년 알려면은
둥굴고 누른 것을 봐야한다네.

-原詩-

農家正月望
嘗候月昇天

近北豐山陜
差南稔海邊

赤疑枯草木
白怕漲淵天

圓滿深黃色
方知大有年
(宣祖時易學者 車滄淵雲* 原作)＜2＞

-이 노래는 慶北 安東에서 정월 보름날 밤이면 여자들이 달구경을 하며 左右隊로 노아서 말달아기 가튼 노리를 하며 부르는 노래인데 넷날 高麗末 恭讓王이 그곳에 避難 왓슬 때에 시작된 노래라 한다.
