Serial Story Morning, Episode 6: A Tragic Escape
						An Chae-hong

The events of Episodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5: A young man named Kim Ka-ji (金可之) was from Changsaengpo (長生浦), Ulsan County (蔚山郡), Gyeongsang Province (慶南). He was born with both loyalty and bravery, and had the ambition to become a great hero. He mastered all martial arts and military strategies. At the age of twenty, he left home and traveled around. He obtained the "Northwest Territory Map" (『西北對地圖』), secretly kept by the descendant of Yi Chung-mu Gong (李忠武公), and conspired with Pak Ye (朴曄), the Pacification Commissioner of P'yŏngan Province (平安監司), who was the favorite retainer of King Kwanghae (光海王) and Joseon's only strategist, to plan the conquest of Manchuria and northern China. While surveying the land, he unfortunately encountered the Incident of the Westerners. King Kwanghae was deposed, and Pak Ye was also executed. He had no choice but to return home, disguised as a pilgrim monk, and roamed the secluded mountains, waiting for an opportunity. He happened to meet General Aisin (愛親將軍), the third son of the King of the Jurchens. The Jurchens originally had the grand ambition to conquer the Ming Dynasty and become the Emperor of the Han people, but they lacked a general with both wisdom and courage. By royal order, they dispatched General Aisin to Joseon to find such a person for seven years. Upon seeing Kim Ka-ji, he was greatly pleased and tried to persuade him to go to the Jurchen state. After much deliberation, Kim Ka-ji went to the Jurchen state with General Aisin. The Jurchen King greatly trusted him at first sight and appointed him Chief of Staff and issued a mobilization order for the conquest of the Ming Dynasty. However, in the middle of the invasion of the Ming territory, Nurhaci (노라치) unfortunately died of illness. The eighth prince, Taizong (太宗), who originally had ambitions, inherited the throne with a false will and returned to the capital. At the same time, he changed his father's conquest strategy and imprisoned Staff Officer Kim Ka-ji. <163>

August! It is the early growth of August in the year of Pyŏngin. Although the autumn sun is quite harsh and hot during the day, General Kim Ka-ji, who bears eternal regret in his heart and has become a tiger trapped in the midst of the army, has an expression of both resentment and deep sorrow on his face, with what seems like two streams of bloody sweat flowing down. But, as night falls, the autumn wind in Shenyang (瀋陽) quickly seeps into the soldier's body, made of steel clad in hemp clothing, and evokes a frosty thought. The autumn night in Shenyang, dominated by the continental climate, is as cold as early winter in Ulsan. Caressing the hilt of his sword, General Kim sighs deeply, and a myriad of thoughts overwhelm him like words.

"Ah! Hongtaiji (皇太極), Hongtaiji has finally ousted his brothers and ascended to the throne of Khan. Now that Hongtaiji has seized power, my fate must inevitably be this... But since this year's New Year's Day, when 'Nurhaci' (노라치) refused to listen to my advice at Ningyuan Fortress (寧遠城) and recklessly charged into the city, only to be severely wounded by the landmines planted by Ai Chonghuan (哀崇煥), I had already been abandoned by the god of fate. At that time, I should have seized the opportunity and acted accordingly. After the death of 'Nurhaci' (노라치) at 逮堡, I could no longer decide where a true man should go... Then, do I regret not escaping from Ningyuan Fortress and crossing the Bohai Sea by sea? No. I had already committed myself to dedicating myself to others to manage affairs of the world. How could I be so indecisive about advancing or retreating... Then, should I stretch my neck under 'Hongtaiji's' (홍타시) military order and accept the blade? No, that is not it either. Heaven had its intention in my coming here. I did not die when the previous King (Kwanghae) abdicated and General Pak Ye died, so how could I die so meaninglessly now? Alas, that I, who in the secret chamber of General Park of the Pyongan Garrison (平安監營 朴將軍), pointed at the Northwest Territory Map and vehemently argued for exploiting the discord between 'Hongtaiji' and the 'Dorgon' (多爾袞) brothers, am now like a prisoner under the command of 'Hongtaiji'? Huh, jeez..."

He could not help but sigh deeply. But a man would rather die than have his spirit broken. His sorrow reached its extreme, and he sighed deeply, and after the deep sigh, he became terribly solemn. He straightened his hunched back and sat on the folding chair. Holding the head of his sword with his left hand and resting his right hand on his knee, he had an imposing presence that could not be violated. He was so dignified that he seemed not like a prisoner but rather like a triumphant general victorious in everything.

"Ah! The sword is the soul of a warrior. Hongtaiji has imprisoned me, but he has allowed me the sword. Geez... He can hate me, but he cannot disregard me..."

General Kim Ka-ji's mind was as high and clear and terrifying as the autumn sky. After a while, when a middle envoy came to the imprisoned place, ordered by 'Hongtaiji' to spy on Kim Ka-ji's movements, Kim Ka-ji had already taken off his sword, hung it on the wall, and gone into bed with his clothes on, snoring as comfortably as if his stomach were at ease. The middle envoy could not make a sound with his footsteps and turned around, chilled to the liver and gallbladder. This was what General Kim had in mind.

"If he is to kill me, he will kill me in broad daylight in the midst of the army. Will he assassinate me like a petty thief <164> in the dark of night?"

General Kim, who allowed himself to be killed, also acknowledged 'Hongtaiji's' heroism. The next day, what particularly struck 'Hongtaiji', who had become the Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, was of course the report of the middle envoy.

"It is a pity about the man..."

Like Cao Mengde (曹孟德), who regretted Guan Yunchang (關雲長), he hated him even more and was even more impressed. The sun had set again. An unexpected visitor came to General Kim Ka-ji's place. However, he was not a man from the Later Jin, but a Korean compatriot. Lamenting that seeing each other in this way was mutual misfortune,

"I was a general who was trusted by the former king, and you were a talent who was entrusted by the former king. But I am a fugitive who betrayed the motherland, and you are in the position of a guest who has received an invitation..."

The visitor, who spoke in a very respectful and sorrowful tone, was Kang Hong-rip (姜弘立), whom the reader could guess. In the year of Kimi, the eleventh year of King Kwanghae, when a great battle took place between 'Nurhaci' and the Ming army at the Battle of Sarhū Mountain (■爾滸), Kang Hong-rip, who had come to Manchuria with 15,000 soldiers to repay the old grievances of Imjin Dongbal in the Ming Dynasty, was then the Commander-in-Chief. Because Yunn (潤), the son of Han Myŏng-nyŏn (韓明漣), fled to the Later Jin in the Revolt of Yi Kwal (李适), and it was rumored that even Kang's family had been exterminated by the side that had enthroned King Injo (仁祖), Kang was still attaching a thread of hope to his motherland after the abdication of the former King.

"Looking back at my motherland, there is nothing left to hope for..."

Kang's expression, who spoke these words, was genuinely mournful.

"What guarantee is there that the meaning you hold in your heart will not ultimately turn into a bubble?"

Kang's face, who changed his words like this, was covered in disappointment and anguish. Kim Ka-ji suddenly thought. Kang's words also had no ultimate solution, and 'Hongtaiji' could not be trusted for safety. However, there was no need to agitate 'Hongtaiji's' emotions.

"I have already understood your intention, but my affairs are beyond my control. If there is an opportunity to meet with 'Hongtaiji' Khan, I will only express my grievances."

Kim Ka-ji's attitude, who answered in this way, drew out the true nature of a noble and straightforward man. Although Kang Hong-rip may not have been acting on 'Hongtaiji's' secret order, he could and could not help but say these words. However, it is undoubtedly true that Kim Ka-ji's state of mind was once again reflected in 'Hongtaiji's' heart through Kang Hong-rip.

Escape! Oh, escape! Kim Ka-ji's determined and only path was escape. Kim Ka-ji's heart was overwhelmed by the thought of escaping across the vast plains and mountains of Liaodong (遼東), seven hundred li, with only a horse and a sword. However, the final escape, beyond the boundary of life and death, did not cause him any hesitation. Release your mind and focus all your strength! General Kim, living in such a state of mind, was in a state of peace as light as an autumn leaf, like Mount Tai. The very next day, Kim Ka-ji was still <165> summoned before the throne of 'Hongtaiji', now the Khan of the Later Jin, in the guise of a warrior wearing a long sword. There were attendants without even an inch of iron on the left and right, and 'Hongtaiji' himself, wearing ordinary clothes, faced General Kim, who was wearing a long sword with a calm attitude. The relationship between these two people was truly an expression in real life of the saying that acquaintances are in the enemy camp.

"You have pampered and entrusted the authority of the war tent as an itinerant guest, but you do not appreciate the favor of the late king and secretly harbor different intentions, only trying to benefit the motherland. Can you avoid the crime of those who put Qi first and then Qin?" (先齊오 後秦의 罪를 免할수잇슬가?) He was trying not to lose his true colors as an extraordinary hero in the most solemn tone. This is the time! Kim Ka-ji must tell the thoughts in his heart and ease his attitude, and if it works, it works, and if it doesn't, he will generously choose the path of escape.

"Liaodong and Joseon are in a situation where they cannot be separated. If Liaodong and Joseon join hands, they will wield the winds and clouds of the world, and if they separate, they will be swayed by the winds and clouds of the world. The history of Goguryeo (高句麗) tells this story. If a strong person rises in Liaodong and Mongolia, they will be able to sweep across the Central Plains, as did the Liao, Jin, and Mongols. However, there are so many races from beyond the border who claim to 'enter and rule China' (入主中國) that within a hundred years, they are assimilated by the people of the Central Plains and even forget the roots of their own country. Since the Sixteen Kingdoms of the Five Barbarians (五胡十六國), there has not been a single one who has not done so. Even if the rising power of the Later Jin sweeps away the Ming Dynasty (明朝), which has fallen into extreme weakness and chaos, unless a special arrangement is made, in less than a hundred years, there will be no one left who speaks the language of the Later Jin, and Liaodong will also be given away. Therefore, if I may express my humble opinion, which I have been trusted with since the late king, by first plotting against the Ming Dynasty and forming a complete alliance between Liaodong and Joseon, and preserving the permanent ethnic roots outside the Central Plains, the future situation will be controlled more securely, needless to say. This is unavoidable considering the friendship of the same race and thinking about the future situation. Your Majesty's view is lacking in a single space." (未達一間입니다) Fire seemed to be rising from the tip of Kim Ka-ji's tongue, and he was full of passion. Indeed, 'Hongtaiji', an extraordinary hero, listened attentively for a while with an emotional expression, often even with a smile of understanding.

"However,"

He opened his mouth like this.

"However, it is not that I do not know that, but what can be done when the people of Joseon, high and low, do not know it? The Confucian scholars (朱子) and the yangban (兩班), and the people of Joseon, high and low, who are sick with the idea of revering the Ming Dynasty (尊明思想), cannot even see three feet ahead and are busy cursing us as northern barbarians (北胡). What can be done when your ambitions become a pipe dream? The union of Liaodong and Joseon is what the emperors of the Central Plains have greatly忌讳, and the fact that Silla (新羅) cooperated with the Tang Dynasty (唐朝) to threaten the flanks of Goguryeo and Balhae (渤海) was a great disaster for the Eastern races. But the politics of successive generations of Joseon have only followed this precedent, so as it was in the past, so it is now, and so it will be in the future. <166> It is not that I am lacking in a single space...?"

If Kim Ka-ji's attitude was sharp and fierce, he was all the more 감揚.

Kim Ka-ji was again filled with emotion upon hearing these words, but he soon turned away. However, the conversation between the two hosts and guests could not progress beyond that. Kim Ka-ji was going back to the place where he was a prisoner again.

"The heart inside words can be opened, but the heart inside the castle cannot be opened. How can one be careless when imprisoning a tiger?"

'Hongtaiji' sent Kim Ka-ji back to the house of the prisoner again with words mixed with humor. Alas, because the times were wrong, heroes could not find a place to settle down. Even Kim Ka-ji, who had the strength to embrace the heavens and turn them around, being a prisoner was truly, what to do?

The night was deep. The moon did not show its face, but only the moonlight shone brightly outside the window. Looking out through the window, there was no shadow of a mountain to be seen, and in the midst of the wide Liaodong plain, the sky of Shenyang, deployed in the middle, evoked only endless feelings of emptiness along with the chilly autumn atmosphere. On this night, Kim Ka-ji could not snore again, but only fell into endless sorrow. 'Hongtaiji's' words echoed in his lungs as if they were surrounding him, and Kim Ka-ji was, as if it were something new, feeling the future of Joseon and the ultimate fate of his own life. Because of this, his views did not change, but the piercing sorrow in his marrow intermittently assailed him again. Lying down and then suddenly rising up, sitting on the folding chair, he even showed a slightly agitated expression. It was at this time that the door of the room, which had been lightly knocked on two or three times, opened and entered the room. It was 'Hongtaiji's' younger sister, the daughter of Nurhaci, who could not forget Kim Ka-ji, whom she loved. He could not help but be surprised. The exchange between this noble beauty, who had broken through the ranks of the watching soldiers, and General Kim, whose sorrow was new in the midst of his imprisonment, could not be recorded. However, the death of 'Nurhaci', the enthronement of 'Hongtaiji', and General Kim Ka-ji's imprisonment were all incidents that caused a great storm in the Shenyang political situation, causing all sorts of tragedies, comedies, and even silent plays. There were two young women who were hiding particularly burning passions in their hearts and suffering from secret anguish. One was the ninth princess, who had infiltrated the army with a force that was not easy to shake off and had sneaked into this house of imprisonment. The other was, without question, Madam Kim (金夫人), who had strangely accompanied him from the depths of Mt. Joryeong (鳥岺山). Madam Kim was, of course, anxiously wondering if she could devise some clever plan through her royal brother, who was her husband, or if she could come up with some plan on her own. The princess had the余裕 to display this much courage. However, the princess's final words were,

"If I could make the general enjoy his life with me, I could rather make the general's life safe..."

As a result, a plan for escape was decided between Kim Ka-ji, who already thought that everything was over, and the princess. It was, of course, first and foremost, Kim Ka-ji's safe escape. To escape! Escaping from the imprisoned Shenyang city to the border, a distance of six or seven hundred li in Liaodong, was not an easy task. <167> One day, after 'Hongtaiji' received the congratulations for his first ascension to the throne and held a great banquet with all the civil and military officials, his heart, which had been loosened for the first time, could not withstand the power of the alcohol and fell into a deep sleep. The civil and military officials who were loyal to 'Hongtaiji' were also not able to maintain strict security. In the deep night, near the secret room where Kim Ka-ji was staying, there were two men and women standing in the dim light of the late-rising dawn moon, which was almost five days old. The man, who was tall and sturdy, was busy changing his clothes into a disguise that would make him appear to be on fire, and the young and beautiful woman seemed to be busy giving the man the equipment for his safety. The heroic man, who had taken off his戒服 and changed into ordinary clothes, stroked the long sword he was wearing on his waist again, mounted the swift horse, bent down, and exchanged a warm handshake with the woman. Then, raising his hand and giving a grand farewell, he pressed down on the thick Manchu felt hat, turned his horse's flanks sharply, and hastened his steps, leaving the shadow of the woman who was tearfully seeing him off behind. He had already reached the Small West Gate (小西門), and saying that there was a secret event and that he was urgently heading to the Fushun (撫順) area by royal command in fluent Manchu, he showed the military talisman hidden in his clothes, spurred the horse, and passed through the opening gate. After leaving the gate and galloping for about a solter (a unit of distance), where the gatekeeper could no longer be seen, he suddenly turned his horse's head, circled the city to the right, and headed northeast from beyond the Great North Gate (大北門). He was running along the night road of the boundless wilderness, northeast, northeast. He was pointing to the west and running to the northeast. It is said that if there are more than 10,000 Jurchens, the world cannot stand it, but now they have already become hundreds of thousands of people. However, in the vast Liaodong plains, his villages were so sparse that there was not much of an obstacle to this fugitive escaping. From several hundred li away from Shenyang City, he took the middle line of Xingjing (興京) and Tiehling (鐵岺) and was now gradually heading towards the dense forest area of ​​Mount Paektu (白頭山), pretending to be nonchalant. He was urging the boatman to cross the upper reaches of the Huifa River (輝發河), and receiving the desolate autumn wind on his fluttering clothes, he was going on the road of a traveler full of resentment without stopping. His belongings were nothing, and he was carrying a sword, a military talisman, and the Northwest Territory Map (西北對地圖) that he had hidden in his saddle, which he had brought out with difficulty. However, he was again confronted with the greatest anguish as if it were something new. It was nothing but his own anguish. He could not cross the Yalu River (鴨綠江) and return to his motherland, nor could he go to the Ming Dynasty, which he had been hostile to. No matter how he thought about it, he had nowhere to go in the vast world. He had forgotten that he had entered the dense forest area. The horse and man of General Kim Ka-ji, who had been riding long distances for several days to the point where even the well-fed horse was withering, had now already climbed the central peak of Mount Paektu and reached a state where there was no one around. Sitting on the back of the horse, which was going as it pleased with the reins loose, the vast forest, which had not heard the sound of poison for ten thousand years, covered the sky and enveloped the souls, giving only an endless feeling of solemnity and tranquility. However, before the night was fully dark, a large, dilapidated house caught his eye in a place where the forest opened up and the mountain fields were 편편. He got off his horse, led the reins, and entered the house. The large house was 휘휘, and above it was a large altar that was mostly ruined. Seeing that only the characters "Open Heaven 홍..." (開天弘……) remained on the rotten hanging board in the main hall of the house, Kim Ka-ji realized that it was the Mount Paektu sacrificial site (白頭山祭天所) from the Jin Dynasty (金國) and decided to avoid the wind and dew for one night. The felt was spread out, and a torch of tree branches was set ablaze by striking the firestone. The rice cake that he had bought during the day for the sake of emergency would have to make do with his one day's worth of food. However, in the deep, solemn, and terrifying forest, the faint flickering light of the torch and the sound of the horse's mouth chewing grass, along with the sound of the night wind passing over the forest, drew General Kim Ka-ji, who had been released from a place of tranquility and safety from the midst of繁昌危難, into an endlessly deep sorrow. He had suddenly fallen from the great loneliness that had 통한万古 into the great sorrow that 통한万古.

"Oh—Joseon, the Xiongnu (匈奴), Wiman (衛滿), Liu Che (劉徹), Dongmyeongseongwang (東明聖王), Yeongnakdaewangmar (永樂大王丸), the burning of the capital, Eulji Mundeok (乙支文德), Yeon Gaesomun (淵蓋蘇文), Gye-baek (階伯), the tragedy of Nakhwaam (洛花岩), King Bojang (寶藏王), the fall of Pyeongyang Fortress (平壤城), Dae Joyeong's (大祚榮) defeat at Holhan Castle (忽汗城), the Mongol invasions (遼亂蒙固亂), the destruction of the Ganghwa (江華) fortress walls, the 'naval force entering the sea' (入海軍) of Jindo (珍島) and Jeju Island (濟州島), the red-headed tribute, the ruins of Gaeseong (開城), and the phenomenon of the motherland compatriots who are passed out in a white-daydream of revering the Ming (尊明) and factional strife (黨爭) on the horns of a snail! All of these things came surging forth at once as a flame of sorrow that was about to explode in his strong but rather weak heart.

"Euh-heuh-heu, what kind of historical destiny is this? Were all the struggles of my life just a dream? Oh! Is the God of the universe urging me to martyrdom? Even so, am I supposed to swim desperately in this sea of ​​fate until the last day of my breath? Euh-heuh-heu..."

The sorrow turned into a piercing pain throughout his body. He was deranged. The universe was spinning dizzily above his head. He had escaped the crisis, and he was exhausted from safety and from contemplation. Then, how should General Kim Ka-ji's lifelong wish and half-life of bloody history now turn around? And where should he go? <169>
