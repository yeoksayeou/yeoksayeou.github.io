New and Old Modern Eyesores
黃貞秀

Eyesore
＜34-35＞

New Modern Eyesore: Even though it's been a while since the bobbed hair fashion began, she still acts like she's the only modern girl and makes a fuss with her bobbed hair and her too-short skirt!

Old Modern Eyesore: It's been quite a while since they stopped wearing that kind of skirt, but she's the only one still wearing it, and she thinks she's the last modern girl and is still so proud of it!
