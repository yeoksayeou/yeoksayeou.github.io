Hando Eight Views and Hando Ten Views

The Hando Eight Views were created when Jeong Do-jeon composed the titles and wrote poems, after which Kwon Keun and Kwon Woo, among others, responded with their own poems. They are Gijeon Mountains and Rivers, Capital City Palaces and Gardens, Arrayed Stars, Various Wards Established, East Gate Training Ground, West River Docking, South Ferry Crossing Travelers, and North Suburban Grazing Horses (the poems are omitted). The Hando Ten Views were first created by Great Scholar Seo Geo-jeong during the reign of King Seongjong, who composed the titles and wrote poems, namely, Finding Monks at Jangeui, Enjoying the Moon at Jecheon, Sending Guests at Bansong, Treading on Snow with Yanghwa, Admiring Flowers at Mokmyok, Seeking Fragrance at Jeon Bridge, Boating on the Mapo, Appreciating Lotuses at Heungdeok, Watching Lights at Jong Street, and Fishing at Standing Stone.

Jangeui Temple was located near Segeomjeong, Jecheon Pavilion was on the north bank of the Han River, Bansong Pavilion was near the Independence Gate, and Heungdeok was the name of a temple inside the East Small Gate, which was once a famous lotus spot but is now all abandoned. (The poems are also omitted). <17>
