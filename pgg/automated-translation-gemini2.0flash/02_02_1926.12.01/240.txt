**Summary**

This is a short announcement from the magazine *Byeolgeongon*, informing readers that the upcoming New Year issue will contain a survey detailing whether female teachers at girls' schools are married or unmarried. The magazine emphasizes its intention to cover this topic thoroughly. From a historical perspective, this piece is interesting as it reflects societal interest in the lives of educated, working women in colonial Korea, particularly focusing on marital status which often dictated social standing and career possibilities for women at the time. It also points to the magazine's role in conducting and publishing social surveys.
