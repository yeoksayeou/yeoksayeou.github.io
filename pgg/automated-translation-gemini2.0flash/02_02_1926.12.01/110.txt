Call for Rare Photographs

Dear Readers, if you have any rare photographs (珍寫眞) of people, scenery, or other curiosities, please send them to the editorial department of our company's "Pyŏlgŏn'gon". If they are good, we will introduce them in this magazine (本誌) and present a small token of appreciation (薄謝). <27>

**Summary**

This brief article is an announcement from the magazine "Pyŏlgŏn'gon" soliciting rare photographs from its readers. The magazine asks for images of people, landscapes, or any unusual subjects, promising to publish suitable submissions and provide a modest reward. From a historical perspective, this piece highlights the magazine's interactive approach with its readership and the increasing role of photography in documenting life and curiosities in 1920s Korea. It suggests an interest in user-generated content and offers a potential avenue for capturing less formal or widely unseen aspects of the period.
