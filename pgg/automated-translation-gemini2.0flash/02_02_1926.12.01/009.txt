First Year, Byeolgeonkon, December Issue

Snow falls on the green mountains, every peak turns to jade. That mountain's greenness depends on the spring rain, but how could our white hair ever turn black again?
Anonymous

White snow has fallen on the desolate valley, and clouds hang heavy. Where has the welcome plum blossom bloomed? Standing alone in the setting sun, I know not where to go.
Yi Mogŭn

The north wind blows on the treetops, the bright moon is cold in the snow. Gripping my long sword, I sit high on the border tower; with a long whistle and a great shout, there is nothing to hinder me.
Kim Chongdan

Spring wind, peach and plum blossoms, do not boast of your pretty looks. Behold the green pine and bamboo in the harsh cold of winter! How could their upright and noble principles ever be changed?
Kim Yugi

Sitting high on Paektu Mountain, I look down upon the lands before and behind. Across the ten thousand li north and south, old thoughts become new. If the spirit of the departed lord were here, I might shed tears.
Anonymous

Though they say Mount T'ae is high, it is still a mountain beneath the sky. If one climbs and climbs again, there's no reason one cannot ascend. But people do not climb themselves, and only say the mountain is high.
Yang P'ongnae

**Summary**

This section from the December 1926 issue of Byeolgeonkon presents six traditional Korean poems (Sijo). The poems, attributed to classic poets like Yi Mogŭn and Yang P'ongnae as well as anonymous authors and others like Kim Chongdan and Kim Yugi, explore themes common in Sijo: the contrast between unchanging nature and human aging, loneliness amidst desolate landscapes, steadfastness and integrity in adversity (symbolized by pine and bamboo), patriotic resolve on the frontier, historical reflection and longing from Paektu Mountain, and the virtue of perseverance. From a colonial history perspective, the publication of these traditional Korean poems, including those with themes of endurance, loyalty, and national landscape (Paektu Mountain), in a popular magazine could be seen as an effort to maintain and assert Korean cultural identity and literary heritage during Japanese rule. The selection might subtly reflect contemporary feelings of loss, resilience, or national consciousness.
