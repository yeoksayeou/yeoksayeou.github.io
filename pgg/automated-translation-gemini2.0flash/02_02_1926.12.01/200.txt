Each Person, Each Color (Part 4)

It has been well-known since his Tōkyō student days that our old friend Mr. Ch'oe Rin (崔麟) loves Go (바둑). Not only is he a skilled player (善手), but he also enjoys it immensely. In ancient China (支那), Hsieh An (謝安) of the Jin (晉) dynasty loved Go so much that he disregarded the invasion of enemy forces (敵軍) and continued playing, only stopping when he heard the report (報道) that the enemy had retreated (退却). Since Mr. Ch'oe has not yet faced a position (地位) and situation (境遇) like Hsieh An's, we cannot know what he would do in such a critical situation. However, at ordinary banquets (宴席) or in his own home, if he meets a Go opponent (對手), he truly plays Go regardless of whether the night grows late, others are making noise, or what they are talking about, and doesn't budge an inch.

Recently, he has taken a special interest (趣味) in calligraphy and painting (書畵), and when at home, day or night, he rarely puts down his brush. His calligraphy and painting have progressed beyond the imagination (想像 以上) of ordinary people, so much so that compared to a few (몃) years ago, one must truly see him in a new light (刮目相對). He has always suffered from poor health due to a stomach ailment (胃腸病), and in mid-October this year, he went to Tōkyō to treat it. His acquaintances (親知) are very curious whether he might perhaps have Go friends or calligraphy/painting friends at some hospital (病院) there to relieve the lonely (孤寂) feelings of his journey (旅懷).

He originally has skillful social manners (交際術), so perhaps out of concern (念慮) about potential bad breath when speaking to others, it is his characteristic (特色) to always cover his mouth with his right hand when talking. Also, he observes others intently, scrutinizing (삺히고) the counterpart's expression and tone (氣色語訓), and then, when he speaks, he does so with a very deliberate attitude (甚重 態度), starting his words by drawing out the polite "Ne—" (네-) sound characteristic of the Hamhŭng accent (咸興語套). This is also one of his habits (習慣). ... ...<57>

**Summary**

This article describes the personality and interests of Ch'oe Rin, a prominent figure. It highlights his deep passion for the game of Go, comparing his dedication to the historical Chinese figure Hsieh An, and notes his recent enthusiasm and significant progress in calligraphy and painting. It also mentions his chronic stomach illness, a recent trip to Tōkyō for treatment, and his distinctive habits, such as covering his mouth while speaking and using a drawn-out "Ne—" characteristic of the Hamhŭng dialect. For historians, the article offers a glimpse into the personal life, hobbies, social mannerisms, and health concerns of a notable Korean intellectual during the Japanese colonial period. The mention of his Tōkyō connections (student days, medical treatment) and specific habits like the Hamhŭng accent provides cultural and social context.

各人各色 (其四)

古友 崔麟氏의 바둑 조와하는 것은 東京留學生 時代부터 評判이 만핫섯다. 바둑이 善手도 善手려니와 질겨하기도 퍽은 질겨한다. 녯적 支那의 晋나라 謝安이가 바둑을 질겨하야 敵軍의 侵入하는 것도 不顧하고 바둑만 두다가 그 적군이 退却하얏다는 報道를 듯고야 겨우 바둑을 놋터라더니 氏는 아즉 謝安과 가튼 지위와 境遇를 당하야 보지 안핫스닛가 그런 위급한 경우가 되면 엇지 할는지 알 수 업지만은 普通의 宴席이나 자기 집에서 對手의 바둑 친구를 맛난다하면 그야말로 밤이 새든지 남이 떠들든지 무슨이약이를 하든지 다 不拘하고 바둑만 두고 꿈쩍도 안이 한다. 그리고 근래에는 書畵에다 특별히 趣味를 부치여 집에 잇슬때에는 밤이나 낫이나 잠시도 붓을 놋치 안는데 그의 書畵도 보통사람의 상상 이상으로 진보되야 몃 해 전에 비하면 아주 刮目相對할 만하다. 그는 항상 胃腸病으로 몸이 不健하얏섯는데 금년 10월 중순에 그것을 치료하기 위하야 東京에 가서 엇던 病院에도 或 바둑친구와 書畵家친구나 잇서서 각금 孤寂할 旅懷나 푸는지 그의 친지의 매우 궁금해하는 바이다. 그는 원래 交際術이 능한 까닭에 남과 對할 때에 무슨 냄새가 날가 念慮함인지 말을 할 때이면 항상 오른손으로 입을 가리고 하는 것이 특색이고 또 남을 심히 보와 그 상대자의 氣色語훈을 삺히고 그 다음에 자기가 말을 낼 때에는 가장 심중한 태도로 예의 咸興語套의 『네-』 소리를 길게하고 말을 시작한다. 이것이 또한 그의 한 習慣. ... ...＜57＞
