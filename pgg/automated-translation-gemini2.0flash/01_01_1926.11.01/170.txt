Biography: Eternal Loyalty, General Im Kyŏngŏp
						Ch’a Sangch’an

Wearing the Three Characters 『大丈夫』(Great Man) on His Body

Among our Korean people who have blood and gall, none will be able to forget the national disgrace of the Pyŏngja Horan (Manchu Invasion of 1636) for ten thousand ages; and those who cannot forget the national disgrace of the Pyŏngja Horan will also not forget the peerless, renowned General Im Kyŏngŏp (林慶業 將軍), who was intensely loyal and righteous at that time. This General Im let out his first cry 332 years ago from today, that is, in the 27th year of King Sŏnjo (宣朝) of the Yi Dynasty (李朝) (22nd year of the Wanli era of Emperor Shenzong of Ming - 明神宗萬曆), the Kapo year, on the 2nd day of the 11th month (Pyŏngja day, Ja hour), in Sŏn’gok-ri (蓀谷里), Puron-myŏn (富論面), Wŏnju County (原州郡), Kangwŏn Province (江原道). His courtesy name was Yŏngbaek (英伯) (also called Kyebaek - 繼伯), and his clan origin was P’yŏngt’aek (平澤). (Regarding his birthplace, some claim it was Talch’ŏn, Ch’ungju (忠州 達川), some claim Kaech’ŏn, P’yŏngnam (平南 价川), and some claim Wŏnju. The theories are not consistent, but there is a site marking his birth in Sŏn’gok-ri (俗稱 손의실 - commonly known as Sonŭisil), Puron-myŏn, Wŏnju County. Also, on Paegun Mountain (白雲山) in that village, there is his ancestor's tomb, known as the "General's Great Sitting Form" (將軍 大坐形). Furthermore, according to local legends and descendant accounts, it is certain that he was born in Wŏnju and moved to Talch’ŏn, Ch’ungju in his youth). His physique was short and small, less than 7 ch'ŏk (尺 - feet) tall, but from a young age, he possessed a magnanimous and upright great ambition, coupled with outstanding courage and eloquence akin to the Yellow River (懕河 - likely a metaphor for vast eloquence). He always enjoyed discussing military affairs and prided himself on having the qualities of a commander. His father (personal name Hwang - 諱篁) once admonished him, saying, "In our country, men of military talent invariably meet strange misfortunes, so be especially cautious." At the age of 6, while playing with a group of children on the streets of Ch’ungju, he built ramparts with stones and made flags with grass, enacting battle formations. He acted as the great general, commanding the other children. Just then, an official procession from Yŏngnam (嶺南) passed by and attempted to break through his formation. The general shouted loudly, "The camp cannot be broken!" and resolutely refused passage. The official found this greatly peculiar, respected him, and went around. Also, at the age of 9, while reading the "Biography of Xiang Yu" (史記 項羽傳) from the Records of the Grand Historian, upon reaching the phrase "Writing is merely sufficient to record one's name; I wish to learn the art of defeating ten thousand enemies" (書는 足以記姓名이니 願學萬人敵), he declared, "This is truly the saying of a great man (大丈夫)." From then on, he specifically wrote the two characters 『大丈夫』 (Great Man) and carried them on his person. The general's heroic and unrestrained spirit was already evident in his childhood. <93>

Seventeen, He Begins Training in Archery and Horsemanship

The general's family was originally poor, and food and clothing were always scarce, but he paid it no mind, solely devoting himself to reading military texts. From the age of 17, he again dedicated himself fully to learning archery and horsemanship (弓馬). Even in storms or heavy rain, he never skipped a single day, diligently practicing archery. Within a year, his skill reached a masterful level, and no one dared to rival him. However, lacking funds to buy a bow and arrows, whenever his parents provided him with new clothes, he would always sell them to buy bows and arrows, chasing after archery companions in ragged clothes patched a hundred times. People at the time called him a madman. One day, a neighbor, feeling pity for the general's poverty, lent him land and told him to cultivate it. The general, while plowing the field, feigned illness, returned the land to the neighbor, and expressed his gratitude. The neighbor, feeling even more pity, cultivated the field for him. The general lay on the ridge with his eyes closed, reciting military texts, and returned home after sunset. The neighbor, truly believing he was ill, gave him food and also farmed for him. This was the general employing a small, temporary stratagem. Afterwards, the general, while practicing archery alone, sighed deeply and lamented, "I have received the energy of heaven and earth; I was not born an animal but became human. Among humans, I was not born a woman but a man. How can I merely hibernate in this rural corner, living虚生夢死 (a vain life ending in a dreamlike death)?" Consequently, he and his younger brother Saŏp (嗣業) took the military service examination together and passed consecutively. He was immediately dispatched for autumn border defense (防秋) at Kapsan (甲山). The general was 25 years old at the time.

A Three-Foot Dragon Spring Sword, Ten Thousand Volumes of Books

After serving at Kapsan for two years, the general was promoted to the command post at Sonongbo (小農堡), Samsu County (三水郡). Not long after, he received the special favor of being promoted to Chŏlch’ung Changgun Kajajŭk (折衝將軍加資 - a military rank). This was specifically due to his merit in expanding military preparations in that region. Also, while stationed at Sonongbo, the general was strolling by a large pond when he obtained a three-ch'ŏk divine sword (神劒) from a snake. He composed a poem and inscribed it on the sword, the lines widely recited by people: "A three-foot Dragon Spring sword, ten thousand volumes of books (三尺龍泉萬卷書), What was Heaven's intent in creating me? (皇天生我意何如). A chancellor east of the mountains, a general west of the mountains (山東宰相山西將), He is a great man, and I am a great man (彼丈夫兮我丈夫)."

Solely Inspecting the Government Storehouses

Later, in the Sinyu year (辛酉) (when the Duke was 28), upon completing his autumn duties, he returned to the capital and served in the position of Ch’ŏmji Chungch’ubusa (僉知中樞府事). Then, he faced the rebellion of Yi Kwal (李适) in the Kapcha year (甲子) (when the Duke was 31). This was a golden, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the general to achieve great merit. <94> He resolutely went to the Commander-in-Chief's camp (元師營), volunteered to suppress the rebels, and fought fiercely at Anhyŏn (鞍峴) with his older brother Sŭngŏp (承業) and younger brother Chunŏp (俊業). When victory was achieved, while many generals and soldiers rushed to the temporary royal court (行在所) to boast of their merits, <94> the general alone went straight to Yongsan (龍山) to inspect the government storehouses (府庫) and rally the scattered soldiers. At that time, the accountant Kim Yŏŭi (金汝義), transporting the treasury ledgers (金厚簿書) by boat towards Kangdo (江都), was captured by Yi Kwal's faction and nearly faced death. The general, along with his brothers, drew swords and pursued the rebel band. Through this, they recovered all the treasures, and Kim Yŏŭi also preserved his life, later becoming the general's trusted confidant. After the rebellion was quelled, both brothers were recorded as second-class merit subjects (原從二等), while the general was recorded as first-class, promoted to Kasŏn Taebu (嘉善大夫). The following year, Ŭlch’uk (乙丑), he became Ch’ŏmji Chungch’ubusa and concurrently Urimwijang (羽林衛將). Soon after, he was appointed Pangt’apch’ŏmsa (防踏僉使), and the next year, Pyŏngin (丙寅), he became the Magistrate of Nagan County (樂安郡守). Within a few months of taking office, his administrative achievements were remarkable, and the people all praised his virtue.

The Peace Treaty at Kangdo and the General

Then, in the 5th year of King Injo (仁조), Chŏngmyo (丁卯) (when the Duke was 34), the Horan (胡亂 - Manchu Invasion, referring to the first one in 1627) occurred. The Provincial Military Commander (節度使) wanted to make the general the Left Camp Commander (左營將), while the Provincial Governor (觀察使) wanted to make him the Central Army Commander (中軍). They issued summonses (檄) simultaneously, calling for the general. He first met the governor and said, "The military commander is the general who advances, while the governor merely commands from the rear. Although it might be fortunate for a soldier to be in the rear, I hold the second official rank (官階二品) and have received immense grace from the state (國恩). It is my duty to go to the battlefield and repay the country with my death. The rear position is not what I desire." The governor respected his righteousness and granted his request. The general immediately went to the military headquarters, organized the troops, and traveled double-time to Kanghwa (江華). By then, the peace treaty (講和) had already been concluded. He had no choice but to withdraw his troops, lamenting indignantly, "If the court gave me just 40,000 elite riflemen (精砲), within less than a month, I could sweep clean the barbarians' den (虜穴), wash my sword in the Yalu River (鴨水), and return." The following year, Mujin (戊辰), Kim Pan (金槃), an aide to the Supreme Commander (都體察使從事官), reported the general's administrative achievements. The King issued an edict of praise (褒彰之諭旨) and specially bestowed a royal robe (御衣 一襲). However, the court of that time, where praise and blame (褒貶) were inconsistent, dismissed the general from his post that same year and made him a Special Commander under the Supreme Commander (體察使別將). This was because he had not sent a ceremonial fan (節扇) to the powerful traitor Sim Kiwŏn (沈器遠), so the scoundrel Sim instigated censors (言官) to falsely accuse and impeach the general. Later, in the Kisa year (己巳), he again became Yonghyangwi Puhogun (龍驤衛副護軍). In the Kyŏngo year (庚午), upon the request of P'yŏngan Governor (平安監司) Min Sŏnghwi (閔聖徽), he became the Central Army Commander of P'yŏngyang (平壤中軍). (At that time, Ming's Kado Commandant Liu Xingzhi - 明假島都督劉興治 - secretly communicated with the northern barbarians, threatening our country. The Duke, through a plan, sent the Provincial Governor to the Commandant's office, reformed various abuses, and returned without incident. The Provincial Governor praised the Duke as a modern Zhuge Liang - 古之諸葛). In the Sinmi year (辛未) (when the Duke was 38), he was again appointed Defense Commander of Kŏmsan (釰山 防禦使). While constructing the Nŭnghan (凌漢), Unam (雲暗), and Yonggol (龍骨) fortresses, the Duke personally participated in the labor, sharing the hardships with the soldiers all day long, and completed the work in short order. The King particularly commended his efforts and bestowed a royal horse (御馬 一匹). (During his tenure, the Ming General Liu Xingzhi, along with 300 Qing soldiers feigning surrender, attempted to defect to the Qing but was killed by his subordinates. The surrendering soldiers fled to the Duke's camp. The Duke, anticipating this by observing the atmosphere (氣), had already repaired the *垣 - wall/fence? - beforehand and took them in without hesitation. Later, when the Qing forces rose and came demanding those soldiers, <95> the general handed them over, thus avoiding disaster.)

The Imperially Bestowed Flower by the General's Head

It was the 11th year of King Injo, Kye'yu (癸酉) (when the General was 40). At that time, border alarms became increasingly urgent daily. Both the P'yŏngan Governor and the Commander-in-Chief (都元師) reported that affairs on the western border could not be managed without Im Kyŏngŏp. The King specially summoned the general (who was at home mourning his father's death) and appointed him Defense Commander of Ch'ŏngbuk (淸北防禦使) concurrently serving as Magistrate of Nyŏngbyŏn (寧邊府使), ordering him to build the Ŭiju Fortress wall (義州城牒) and Paengma Mountain Fortress (白馬山城). At that time, the Ming rebel generals Kong Youde (孔有德) and Geng Zhongming (耿仲明) camped at Niujiazhuang (牛家庄) and occasionally violated the border with Manchu troops. The general led troops, attacked, and defeated them. The Ming Emperor (明帝) greatly commended him, specially appointing him General-in-Chief (摠兵) and bestowing golden flowers (金花) to be worn in his hair. Both inside and outside the court praised his achievements, and the border region also became peaceful. That winter, as the border troubles subsided, the general resigned his post, returned home to continue mourning. The following year, Kapsul (甲戍), he was reappointed Magistrate of Ŭiju (義州府尹) concurrently Defense Commander of Ch'ŏngbuk. For his merit in establishing the Ever-Normal Granary (常平倉), he was promoted to Kaŭi (嘉義). However, not long after, he was implicated in a minor affair (微事) and stripped of his official rank and position. (Due to not killing *使 - an envoy/messenger? - Censors impeached him - 以不殺*使之故言官論劾)

Reappointed Magistrate of Ŭiju

In the spring of the 14th year of King Injo, Pyŏngja (丙子), the court reinstated the general's position, making him Magistrate of Ŭiju. When the general took leave of the court, he requested, saying, "Upon careful observation of the enemy's situation recently (*日 - in recent days?), the signs of a southward advance are already clear. I request 20,000 cavalrymen to form a plan to counter the enemy." The court refused. Kyŏngŏp resolutely proceeded to his post. He stationed beacon fire troops (烽燧軍) at the border crossing points of Songgol (松鶻) and Ponghwang (鳳凰) on the Yalu River (鴨江) to maintain strict reconnaissance. He also brought 12屯 (tun, a measure of land/grain?) of grain and fodder (橐草) into the fortress, stored dried meat from several hundred diseased cattle (疫牛), piled up firewood like a granary for military provisions (軍粮), and furthermore, dug large ponds within the fortress to raise snakehead fish (䲙魚). When Qing envoys came, he would invariably offer them the fish to demonstrate the fortress's impregnability. Simultaneously, he dispatched military spies (軍偵) with shaved heads and Manchu attire to probe the enemy's situation. He then reported again to the court, requesting irregular troops (奇兵) to guard against the worry of a surprise attack (窃發). The King specially permitted 20,000 troops from Hwanghae Province (黃海軍). The Duke was overjoyed and told Military Commander Yu Rim (柳琳), "If I have 20,000 soldiers, why should I fear the enemy? Even if the enemy enters our territory, instead of engaging them directly, if we immediately strike their homeland with a large force, they will withdraw. Furthermore, troops that have marched over ten thousand li will surely be greatly exhausted. If I deploy elite troops at Ch'ŏngsŏng (靑城) and Hoeryŏng (檜嶺) and attack opportunistically, this is a brilliant strategy of one against a hundred (以一當百)." However, shortly after, censors argued again, stating it was unacceptable to entrust a large army to a border official. The matter was consequently halted – truly an eternally regrettable event, one must say.

The Pyŏngja Horan and the General <96>

Prior to this, the court had done something to offend the Qing, and fearing punitive inquiry (問責), they had the general probe the enemy situation. The Duke thought to himself, "Since the court has incurred the enemy's wrath, their invasion is inevitable." He then sent an interpreter (通事) to Qing territory, instructing him, "If you encounter enemy troops midway and they ask about Paengma Mountain Fortress, reply that eight commanders, each leading three battalions, have come and camped on the border, that weapons like matchlocks (鳥銃) and bullets (彈丸) have been prepared since last year, that provisions are piled like mountains, and that there are large ponds within the fortress yielding abundant fish." When the interpreter reached T'ongwŏnbo (通遠堡), he indeed encountered enemy troops and spoke as the Duke had instructed. The enemy said, "Today, our army will massacre Paengma Mountain Fortress. If your words prove false, we will kill you immediately," and brought the interpreter along. It was the 6th day of the 12th month. The beacon fires at Ponghwang and Songgol rose simultaneously. The Duke urgently reported to the Commander-in-Chief Kim Chadŏm (金自點) to defend against the enemy invasion. However, Chadŏm remained nonchalant and did not inform the court. Consequently, only after the enemy invaded the vicinity of the capital was it known. The royal procession hastily entered Namhan Fortress (南漢) and eventually suffered the humiliation below its walls. How could Chadŏm's heaven-defying crime ever be atoned for, even with a thousand executions? Kyŏngŏp, prior to this, had set up many white cloth tents (白布帳). When the enemy invaded the territory, he draped them continuously along the fortress walls, making it look like whitewashed ramparts (粉牒) from afar. On the battlements (城牒), he piled many stones and had the elderly, weak, women, and children man the defenses. Every three battlements, he built an earthen hut (土室), and in each hut, brewed several bushels of wine (酒), allowing the defenders of the three battlements to rest in shifts, drinking wine to ward off the cold. He provisioned the army with the previously stored dried beef (牛脯), and shouts of joy shook the ground. The enemy crossed the river and headed straight for the capital. The Duke reviewed his garrison troops (屯田兵) and found only 800 weak soldiers. He looked up to heaven and lamented greatly, "What can a general without troops do?" He stamped his feet and wept bitterly. Then, wanting to slow the enemy's advance, he sent men to offer provisions to their army and inquired, "Why are there so many carts and horses on this march? Also, since the border general is here, why do you head straight for the capital without a single word?" The enemy replied, "We have matters to discuss directly with your country's government, so the border general need not be concerned," and continued their relentless march.

Slaying Yot'o on the Yalu River

As the enemy crossed the river daily, they attacked the capital on the 6th. Soon, fearing that the various garrisons on the western route would cut off their rear, they had the fierce general Yot'o (要魋) lead 300 elite soldiers back towards their country. Yot'o was brave and fierce, wearing double-layered snow-white iron armor (鐵衣), spurring his horse into battle. All the armies along the route scattered before him in fear, daring not approach. Kyŏngŏp rode out alone, charged straight at him, pursued him onto the ice of the Yalu River (鴨綠江), cut down Yot'o beneath his horse, killed all his men, and then removed the two layers of iron armor and put them on; they weighed <97> 100 kŭn (斤 - catties). Later, when the enemy returned from Namhan Fortress, they questioned the Duke, asking, "Did you kill Yot'o?" The Duke replied, "Yes. Having received profound grace from the state and long resided on the border, this is the state's weighty responsibility. How could I not kill an enemy invading the border?" The enemy asked, "Why did you not attack when our army first came?" The Duke said, "The few cannot contend with the many. If I died futilely at your hands, it would be difficult to repay the state's grace, so I have endured until now." The enemy asked, "Not attacking before was understandable, but why do you not attack now?" The Duke, with a sorrowful expression and tears streaming, said, "The nation's fortune is ill-fated, suffering humiliation below the fortress walls. Moreover, the princes and grand princes are all within your army, so there is nothing I can do." The enemy was moved by his righteousness.

Initially, when the enemy invaded the capital, the general sent a message written in wax (蠟書) to Military Commander Yu Rim, stating, "The enemy intends a long stay, and the king is besieged in a lone fortress with no plan for repelling them. If the military commander lends me just 10,000 soldiers, I will directly attack Shenyang (瀋陽) and destroy their nest in one stroke. This is the same strategy Sun Bin (孫矉) used by marching straight to the capital of Wei (魏都) to save Han (韓)." However, Rim, inherently jealous of the general's merits, also refused to listen, and thus the great undertaking ultimately failed.

Tearfully Sending Off Scholar Hong at the Battlefront

The following year, Chŏngch'uk (丁丑), Scholar Hong Ikhan (洪翼漢), identified as an official opposing peace (斥和臣), was captured and sent to Shenyang. The escort officer Pyŏn Taejung (邊大中) (then Magistrate of Chŭngsan - 甑山縣令) pierced Scholar Hong's palms with ropes and bound him extremely cruelly. Officials along the route were all terrified and dared not speak out. Only the general went out midway to greet him, saw this, and indignantly declared, "Master Hong is a loyal subject of our country! How can he be treated so abusively?" He personally untied the bonds, grasped his hands, and said, "Your journey, esteemed Sir, is truly the act of a man. Alive, you need not feel shame before the world; dead, your name will hang on bamboo slips and silk (竹帛 - historical records)." He provided lavish hospitality and extremely generous travel expenses. From Chŏngch'uk onwards, the general constantly communicated secretly with the Ming Dynasty (明國), intending to undertake a great enterprise, but could not find the right person. Then, hearing of the reputation of the righteous monk Tokpo (獨步) from Hyangsan Mountain (香山) (lay name Sin Hyŏl - 申歇), he established ties with generous gifts. After consulting with Ch'oe Myŏnggil of Wansŏng (崔完城鳴吉) and Yi Sibaek of Yŏnyang (李延陽時白), he sent Tokpo to Sŏksŏngdo Island (石城島) in Ming territory, initiating communication. Later, the general was falsely accused and exiled again to Ch'ŏlsan (鐵山). In the spring of the 18th year of King Injo, Kyŏngjin (庚辰), the Qing, intending to attack Jinzhou (錦州) in Ming territory, requested troops from our country. The court released the general from exile and appointed him Commander-in-Chief of the Naval Forces (舟師上將). The general, along with Vice-Commander Yi Wan (李浣), headed towards the battlefield but midway claimed to have been hit by a storm (飄風). He sent men to the Ming forces to convey his intention to respond accordingly. In the 6th month, upon reaching Kaechu (盖州), he encountered 40 Ming ships. Both sides removed the shot (丸) from their cannons, fired blanks (총), discarded their arrows' metal tips (簇), and shot shafts (矢), feigning battle for a long time <98> before pretending defeat and returning. The Qing general, suspicious, sought to uncover this. He divided his troops and deployed them afar, disguised as Ming soldiers. The Duke, anticipating this plot as well, fired poisoned arrows and fierce projectiles indiscriminately, killing many Qing soldiers. The Qing general, unable to do anything, sent him back to his own country. At that time, the general also recruited skilled swimmers, sent them to the Ming army to report the situation in Joseon, and received the Ming Emperor's personal edict (討淸親詔) to attack the Qing. The general's ingenious strategies were difficult even for gods and spirits to fathom.

Viewing His Prized Horse and Beloved Concubine as Dust

However, tragically, in the 20th year of King Injo, Imo (壬午) (when the Duke was 49), Ming's Jinzhou fell, and Left Commander-in-Chief (左都督) Hong Chengchou (洪承疇) surrendered to the Qing. His subordinate reported Kyŏngŏp's secret communications, and additionally, Ko Ch'ungwŏn (高忠元) from Chŏngju (定州), imprisoned in Shenyang (瀋獄), spoke of Kyŏngŏp sending Tokpo. The Qing court was furious, held our country accountable, and demanded the arrest and extradition of Ch'oe Myŏnggil (崔相鳴吉 - Prime Minister Ch'oe) and the general. From this point, the general's fate became even more perilous and complicated. In the 12th month, following a royal command, the general, accompanied by his concubine Maehwan (梅環) and two servants, left the capital. Upon reaching Kŭmgyo Station (金郊驛) in Hwanghae Province (黃海道), at midnight, he looked up to the heavens and sighed, "Heaven gave birth to me, a man, surely for a purpose! How can I suddenly face the *延 - execution ground? - and become a ghost who died in vain? Better to die, but after exhausting ******* - unclear text - , avenging the shame of the two sons (兩子 - referring to Crown Prince Sohyeon and Grand Prince Bongnim taken hostage?), repaying the grace of the Imjin War (壬辰 - Japanese Invasion of 1592), and enabling the Crane Carriage (鶴駕 - royal carriage) to return east." He then looked at Maehwan and said, "Go hide at the house of Hŏ To (許道) in Yangju (楊州) and escape misfortune." (She later indeed escaped harm). The general, leaning on his sword, went to Hoeam Temple (檜巖寺) in Yangju, left his clothes there, proceeded to the border of P'och'ŏn (抱川) and Kapyŏng County (加平郡), abandoned his beloved horse which he rode, shaved his head (髮) to become a monk, entered Yanggu County (楊口縣) in Kangwŏn Province, and spent the winter in a certain straw hut. Who could possibly recognize him as the former General Im?

Alone with a Single Sword, Entering the Tiger's Den

From then on, the general sometimes wandered trace-less by rivers and lakes (江湖), sometimes relied on old acquaintances, drifting aimlessly. In the 2nd month of Kye'mi (癸未) (when the Duke was 50), he reached Haengju (幸州), Koyang County (高陽郡), conspired with his close friend Yi Sowŏn (李小元) (also known as Mugŭm - 武金, a merchant - 商業), and recruited merchants Pak Suwŏn (朴守元), Ch’a Chaeryong (車再龍), and Yi Sŏngnam (李成南) from Haemi (海美), saying, "A certain wealthy monk intends to transport grain to P'yŏngan Province (平安道). If you provide the boat (船卜 - likely 船隻, boat), you will be paid high wages." The merchants all believed him without doubt and sailed the boat onto the West Sea. Upon reaching Yŏnp'yŏngdo Island (延平島) near Haeju (海州), the Duke drew a sword from his baggage, struck the boat's prow, and shouted loudly, "I am Military Commander Im (林兵使)!" Everyone was terrified and dared not disobey his command. However, whether fortunate or unfortunate, they encountered a sudden fierce storm (狂風) midway, and the boat drifted to Haep'ung County (海豊縣) in Ming China. The county people suspected them of being Qing spies and intended to kill them, but then realized it was General Im. They held him in jail <99> and reported urgently to the Provincial Administration Commission (布政司). At that time, Ming General-in-Chief Huang Zongye (黃宗裔) was stationed in Dengzhou (登州). Learning of the general's imprisonment, he sent men to break open the jail, welcomed the general, treated him as an honored guest, and discussed state affairs. (At that time, the Ming Emperor also ordered him to stay in Dengzhou - 時明帝亦命留登州). In the 4th month of Kapsin (甲申), Li Zicheng (李自成) captured the Ming capital. Zongye had Ma Hongzhou (馬弘周) replace him and escaped to join the fray – this was a great misfortune for the general. Matters having reached this point, the general had no choice but to stay at Ma Hongzhou's garrison and wait for another opportunity. Soon after, Shanhai Pass (山海關) also fell, and the Qing ruler occupied Yanjing (燕京 - Beijing). Hongzhou also intended to surrender to the Qing. The general, aware of his intention, tried to escape under cover of night but was foiled due to Tokpo's betrayal (漏說). In the first month of Ŭlyu (乙酉), the scoundrel Ma arrested the Duke and surrendered him to the Qing. The Duke was consequently sent to prison in Yanjing. (At that time, the Qing soldiers shaved the heads of Ma Hongzhou and his officers and soldiers, and also attempted to shave the general's head, but the general roared fiercely, and the enemy dared not touch him).

Alas! State Affairs Unsettled, He Died First

While the Duke was imprisoned in Yanjing for a total of 18 months, the enemy tried to persuade him with all sorts of advantageous offers, but the general resisted firmly until death, refusing to yield. The enemy was moved by his righteousness, even shedding tears (涕淚). Later, in Pyŏngsul (丙戌), Chief Envoy Yi Kyŏngsŏk (李景奭) and Vice-Envoy Kim Yuk (金堉), among others, went to Yanjing and requested the Duke's return. Upon his repatriation, the court, charging him with the crime of desertion in Imo (壬午), bound him in fetters (縷絏) and escorted him to the capital. People along the route all wept without exception. (At that time, the Duke still wore Joseon clothing and had not shaved his head - 時公尙着朝鮮服而亦未削髮). Previously, Kim Chadŏm held a grudge against the general (Chadŏm believed the Ch'ŏngbuk region was vast, sparsely populated, and difficult to defend, wanting to cede it to the Qing. The general strongly opposed this view. The people of Ch'ŏngbuk also went to the pass and petitioned against it, thwarting Chadŏm's plan. Chadŏm felt ashamed and resented the general thereafter - 自點以淸北地廣人稀勢難固守欲割讓子淸, 將軍力排其論, 淸北人民亦詣關上訴未遂其志自點愧之因怨將軍). Furthermore, Chadŏm harbored treacherous ambitions but hesitated to act due to his fear of the general, seeking any opportunity to harm the Duke. (In the previous years, Imi - 1642? - and Imsin - 1632? - he attempted to incriminate the general but failed. Also, upon entering Yanjing, he strongly urged the Qing ruler to execute the general but did not succeed - 先年李未壬申兩歲欲搆罪將軍未果又入燕時力勸淸主欲殺害將軍未得). Now, he again falsely accused the general, vehemently claiming involvement in the Sim Kiwŏn (沈器遠) conspiracy of the Kapsin year (甲申年 - 1644). (At that time, although Nam Iung - 南以雄 - defended the general, his efforts were ineffective - 時南以雄雖辯護將軍未得其效). The King personally interrogated (親鞠) him but, fearing a miscarriage of justice, hesitated repeatedly and remanded him to prison. Chadŏm then secretly bribed the prison officials to apply severe torture. The general cried out loudly, "State affairs are still unsettled! How can you kill me so lightly?" and finally died in prison. This was the 20th day of the 6th month of the 24th year of King Injo, Pyŏngsul (丙戌), and the general was 53 years old.

Even Plants and Trees Knew the General's Grievance

Even when an ordinary woman harbors a grievance, frost flies in the fifth month. How much more so when a general whose loyalty pierced the sun (貫日之精忠) died unjustly – how could even plants and trees not know his grievance? For three days from the general's death (­»日 - likely 歿日, day of death), all plants and trees withered as if hit by heavy frost. Furthermore, the general's beloved horse, kept in the royal stables (太廏), upon being told by its groom of the general's death, refused food (掇食 - picking at food) and neighed mournfully for several days before dying. (The Duke had a famous steed that could travel a thousand li a day and leap several tens of chang. When he became a fugitive, he removed its bridle and abandoned it in the wild. Later, it ended up in the Royal Stables. At this time, the groom informed it of its master's death. The horse then neighed sorrowfully, refused to eat, and died - 公有名騅日行干里能超數十丈亡命時脫勒棄野後流入太僕至是御者告以主人之死馬遂悲鳴不食而死) <100> The accountant Kim Yŏŭi embraced the general's corpse (屍), wept bitterly until nearly expiring, prepared a fine coffin (棺槨) and shroud (歛衣), composed a eulogy, and held a memorial rite (祭). Besides him, everyone from the capital and countryside, young and old, men and women, shed tears. Later, during the reign of King Sukjong (肅宗), in the Chŏngch'uk year (丁丑) (50 years after the Duke's death), his son Chungbŏn (重蕃) submitted a petition (䟽), finally clearing his name. His official rank was restored, and later, in Pyŏngsul (丙戌), he was granted the posthumous title Ch'ungmin (忠愍) ("Loyal and Steadfast" - 盛衰純固曰忠在國逢難曰愍). In Kyŏngin (庚寅), scholars from Ŭiju proposed building a memorial academy (院) at Paengma Mountain Fortress. (There is also the Hyŏnch'ung Shrine - 顯忠祠 - in Ŭiju). During the reign of King Yŏngjo (英宗), in Pyŏng'o (丙午), scholars from the Hoso region (湖西) founded the Ch'ungnyŏl Shrine (忠烈祠) at Talch’ŏn, enshrining his portrait (遺像), which remains to this day.

The General's Wisdom and Resourcefulness in Adapting to Circumstances

When the general was in the army, he shared joys and sorrows (甘苦) with his soldiers. When building over ten fortresses, he personally carried earth and stones and wielded the tamping mallet (版鍾). If a man committed a merit or crime, however small, reward or punishment was always clearly applied. After punishing a crime, he would always invite the person, offer generous food and drink, and console them earnestly. Therefore, even if the caning (刑杖) was excessive, no one spoke ill of him. Also, when dealing with subordinates, his secrecy and management (機密籠絡) were extensive. When giving gifts, he kept it strictly confidential so they wouldn't know about each other, making each feel specially favored. Thus, they all became his confidants, willing to follow him even to *宅地 - grave site? - with pleasure. Furthermore, he adapted skillfully to circumstances (臨機善變). When dealing with the Manchu barbarians (虜賊), he always managed them with clever schemes (奇計), never failing once in a hundred times. While he was stationed at Yongman (龍灣 - likely near Ŭiju), he suddenly lost an arrow he carried. The Duke already knew it was the doing of a Manchu general. He immediately selected a skilled thief, sent him to the Manchu camp to retrieve the red hat (紅帽) worn by the Manchu leader, and hid it. Later, when the Manchu general came to the Duke's place and threw the arrow the general had lost before him, the general likewise threw the red hat before the Manchu. The Manchu was ashamed and could no longer contend with him. Subsequently, the enemy sent a physiognomist (相者) to assess the Duke's appearance. The general, knowing this, put dried meat (脯肉) inside his boots and stood up. The physiognomist observed him and said, "If he were just one inch shorter, he would have the face of a world-renowned general," and from that time on, did not seek to harm him. Also, after the Pyŏngja year (丙子), Qing officials coming and going caused much trouble, greatly burdening the counties and prefectures. The general obtained a bell (一鈴) from the Qing ruler, issued orders within his command, and strictly punished any Qing person who transgressed. Thus, these abuses eventually ceased. (Other stories omitted - 餘不盡記)

The General's Wife and Brother, Embodying Loyalty, Filial Piety, and Integrity

It is said that loyal subjects come from filial gates; the general's family truly produced generations of military officers and loyal figures. His father, Hwang, was a Chŏrwi (折衛 - military official rank). His grandfather Tŏgyun (德胤) passed the military exam and became a Pujang (部將 - military rank). His great-grandfather Yumyŏng (有名) was a Sahŏnbu Kamch'al (司憲府監察 - Inspector in the Office of the Inspector-General). His ninth-generation ancestor was Chŏng (整), the Minister of Punishments (刑曹判書) and concurrently Supreme Inspector-Envoy for the Northwest Frontier (西北面都巡問察理使) of the Yi Dynasty, posthumously named Konghye (恭惠公). His wife was an eighth-generation descendant of Grand Prince Chinan (鎭安大君). After the general became a fugitive, she too was imprisoned by the barbarians. <101> Unable to endure the enemy's cruel torture (惡刑), she looked up to heaven and cried out, "My husband is a loyal subject of the Eastern Country (東國 - Korea), and I am the wife of a loyal subject! How can I bear to suffer humiliation from the Great Swine (大豖 - derogatory term for Manchus) and stain my husband's loyal integrity? I shall naturally follow my husband in the underworld and become a Korean ghost together!" She drew her ornamental knife (佩刀) and killed herself. The Manchu ruler, moved, sent her body back with honors (禮送). Furthermore, the general's third older brother, Hyŏngŏp (亨業) (The Duke had seven brothers - 公有兄弟七人), was inherently a paragon of filial piety. During the Pyŏngja invasion, when the enemy entered, he clung to his mother's coffin (母柩) and refused to flee. The enemy, moved by his filial piety, erected a wooden sign saying, "A filial person must not be harmed" (孝人不可害), and left. (Hyŏngŏp was with his older brother Sŭngŏp at his post in Maengsan - 孟山 - at the time). Later, in the Imo year (壬午), imprisoned by the barbarians due to Kyŏngŏp's affairs, the enemy forcefully tried to make him kneel and bow (拜跪), but he remained unyielding to the end, baring his abdomen and shouting, "Cut open my belly and behold my heart!" while cursing them. After returning, he abandoned his studies for officialdom entirely and lived secluded in the countryside (田園). (King Yŏngjo posthumously awarded him the rank of Chip'yŏng - 持平 - in Kyŏngsul - 庚戍 -, and King Chŏngjo - 正宗 - honored his village gate - 旌閭 - in Kapchin - 甲辰). However, the general unfortunately had no blood descendants. Therefore, he adopted Chungbŏn (重蕃), the son of his younger brother Chunyŏp (俊業), the Magistrate (府使), as his heir to continue the family line.

Tossing Aside the Pen

In the half-myriad years of our history, renowned generals have never ceased to appear generation after generation, but there has been no one like this General Im, who was thoroughly devoted to the country from beginning to end, only to die unjustly in the end. The general lacked the trust of the court, lacked authority, lacked support from within and without, and also faced unfavorable times. Not only that, powerful traitors surrounding him constantly envied, reviled, and cursed him. Yet, he showed not the slightest resentment or submission, merely exerting himself wholeheartedly for the country with a single piece of red loyalty (一片之赤忠). Considering that as a mere border general, defending with a ruined fortress and isolated troops against the powerful northern barbarians (北虜), he made no misstep for over ten years, and that traversing ten thousand li of foreign lands with only his person and a short sword was like crossing uninhabited territory, one can infer how divinely ingenious his wisdom and military strategy were, and how immensely great his courage was. Also, considering that during his exile, he discarded his beloved beautiful concubine and prized horse like mere grass and dirt (草芥), shaved the hair inherited from his parents to become a monk, and when imprisoned in Yanjing, resolutely refused the Manchu ruler's enticements of enfeoffment as a duke or marquis (封爵封侯), and even at the brink of death lamented, "With state affairs unsettled, how can a general be killed so lightly?" one can gauge how fervent his righteous loyalty and great integrity (貞忠大節) were. He exhausted himself for the country (鞠躬盡瘁) and died an unnatural death; his wife also died a martyr's death in a foreign land ten thousand li away; even his beloved horse died for the general, and his brothers and relatives were imprisoned, enduring endless suffering. How magnificent, tragic, and infuriating it is! During the Chŏngmyo invasion (丁卯亂), the general had early requested 40,000 elite riflemen to strike directly at the Manchu capital, but the court refused, and his wish was unfulfilled. Again, during the Pyŏngja invasion (丙子亂), he requested 10,000 soldiers from Military Commander Yu Rim to strike the Manchu capital, but he too refused to listen, leading the king and subjects to suffer the humiliation below the fortress walls. <102> If King Injo had possessed even a little discerning insight and trusted the general, preparations could have been made before the Pyŏngja invasion occurred, and even if the invasion had happened, such disgrace would not have been suffered.
However, Injo failed to recognize the general's worth and trusted treacherous villains, mismanaging state affairs. Furthermore, knowing the general's innocence, he hesitated indecisively, leading to his wrongful death. How can he escape the censure of later generations as an unenlightened ruler (暗君)? Extrapolating from this, it seems not an exaggeration to say that the Yi Kwal Rebellion (甲子之适亂) and the humiliation of Namhan Fortress in Pyŏngja (丙子南漢之辱) were brought upon by Injo himself. Later, King Hyojong (孝宗) also had the grand ambition of a northern expedition (北伐), trusted Song Siyŏl (宋時烈) and Yi Wan (李浣), and sought out talented individuals, yet he failed to redress the general's grievance. How can he be called an enlightened ruler (明君)? It seems quite natural that a lofty scholar like Hŏ Saeng (許生) chose to live in seclusion. Furthermore, among those who narrated the general's biography in later times, their numbers were quite large, but most were intoxicated by pro-Ming slave mentality (尊周的 奴隷主義 - jonju-jŏk noryejuŭi), praising the general with clichés like "Loyal subject of Great Ming" (大明忠臣) and "Vassal of the Imperial Dynasty" (皇朝陪臣), making it seem as if the general's entire life of devotion was for the sake of the Ming Dynasty. How can this not be a point of regret concerning the general? Today, over 280 years after the general passed away, the Qing empire (淸帝國), which was the general's formidable enemy at the time, has already collapsed. The young Xuantong Emperor (宣統) drifts and weeps in a corner of Tianjin (天津). The XX (likely 朝鮮 Joseon) dynasty's altars of state (社稷), where absolute monarchical power harmed the loyal and good while trusting the treacherous and wicked, are already overgrown with millet (禾黍離離 - symbol of ruin). Even the general in the underworld, recalling past events, would surely be filled with boundless emotion, tears of sorrow and joy mingling.
Alas! The autumn grasses of Paengma (白馬) grow green indifferently, the long waves of the Yalu (鴨綠) flow ceaselessly, but the general, harboring eternal regrets (萬古遺恨), roams forever in the land of white clouds (白雲之鄕), his form and shadow vanished. Only a solitary earthen mound (一坏塚) remains in Namwŏn (南原) near Talch’ŏn, where plants and trees stand mournful in the autumn wind and rain. Even a man with bowels of steel (剛腸), how could he hold back the hot tears filling his breast? <103>

**Summary**

This 1926 article by Ch’a Sangch’an recounts the life of General Im Kyŏngŏp, a renowned military figure from the Joseon Dynasty, focusing on his unwavering loyalty during the Manchu invasions (Pyŏngja Horan). It details his early promise, military achievements, strategic brilliance in defending the border against the Qing (Manchus), and his attempts to aid the Ming Dynasty. The narrative highlights his tragic end, betrayed by political rivals like Kim Chadŏm and ultimately executed despite his innocence and immense contributions, largely due to the perceived incompetence and indecisiveness of King Injo. The article laments his unjust death, praises his integrity and that of his family, and contrasts his enduring legacy with the eventual fall of the Qing Empire. The author critiques previous biographies for their "pro-Ming slave mentality," advocating for a more Korea-centric appreciation of the general's patriotism.

From the perspective of Korean colonial history, this article is significant. Written during Japanese rule, the heroic portrayal of Im Kyŏngŏp, a figure famed for resisting foreign invaders (Manchus) and suffering betrayal from within, likely served as a veiled expression of Korean nationalism and anti-colonial sentiment. The criticism of weak leadership (King Injo) and treacherous officials could resonate with contemporary frustrations under Japanese administration. The author's call to reject a "slave mentality" (尊周的 奴隷主義) and focus on national loyalty (盡忠) implicitly promotes Korean self-respect and historical consciousness against the backdrop of colonial assimilation policies. Historians might find the article's nationalistic reframing of a historical figure and its subtle anti-colonial undertones particularly interesting.

傳記 萬古精忠 林慶業將軍
						車相瓚
身佩『大丈夫』三字
피가 잇고 쓸개가 잇는 우리 조선 사람치고는 몃 萬古를 갈지라도 병자호란의 국치를 잇지 못할 것이오 병자호란의 국치를 잇지 못하는 사람은 또한 당시 忠義熱烈한 盖世 名將 林慶業 將軍을 잇지 못할 것이다. 이 林장군은 距今 332년 前 즉 李朝 宣朝 27年(明神宗萬曆 22년) 甲午 11월 2일(丙子日 子時)에 江原道 原州郡 富論面 蓀谷里에서 呱呱의 소리를 내엿스니 字는 英伯(又稱 繼伯)이오 貫은 平澤이다. (公의 출생지에 관하야 혹칭 忠州 達川 혹칭 平南 价川 혹칭 原州라 하야 그 설이 不一하나 原州郡 富論面 蓀谷里(속칭 손의실)에 公의 誕生遺址가 잇고 또 其 洞 白雲山에 소위 將軍 大坐形이라는 公의 先墓가 잇스며 기타 閭巷傳說과 자손의 傳言에 의하면 公이 原州에서 출생하야 幼時에 忠州 達川으로 이주한 것이 확실하다) 爲人이 短小하야 신장이 7尺에 不滿하나 少時로부터 慷慨磊落한 大志가 有하고 膽勇이 絶倫한 中懕河의 辯才를 兼하야 항상 論兵을 조와하고 將帥의 層도 自負하니 그의 부친(諱篁)이 嘗히 誡하야 曰 我國에서 將材의 인물은 반듯시 奇禍를 피하는 事가 有한즉 특히 戒愼하라 하엿섯다. 6세 時에 忠州街路에서 群兒와 遊戱할새 돌로 城壘를 쌋코 풀로 旗幟를 만들어 戰陣의 狀을 벼풀고 스스로 大將이 되야 群兒를 호령하더니 다참 嶺南의 官行이 통과하다가 그 陣을 踏破코자하니 장군이 大聲 曰 陣營은 가히 破치 못한다 하고 절대로 통과를 거절하니 그 官人이 크게 奇異히 思하야 敬而避之하고 또 9세 時에는 史記 項羽傳을 닑다가 「書는 足以記姓名이니 願學萬人敵」이란 句語에 이르러 이는 참 丈夫의 語라하고 그후부터 특히 『大丈夫』 二字를 써셔 몸에 차고 다니엿스니 장군의 英銂�不覊한 氣槪는 幼時에 벌써 다 알 수가 잇섯다.＜93＞

十七始習弓馬
장군은 원래 집이 빈한하야 의식이 항상 궁핍하되 少毫도 고념치 안이하고 오즉 병서를 애독하더니 17세부터는 다시 弓馬를 學함에 專意하야 비록 暴風惡雨가 잇슬지라도 一日도 廢치 안코 열심히 射를 習하니 一年之內에 그 藝가 妙境에 入하야 감히 필적하는 자가 업섯다. 그러나 弓矢를 買할 자금이 無함으로 부모가 新衣를 備與하면 매양 賣却하야 弓矢를 買入하고 百結의 弊衣로 射徒와 追逐하니 時人이 다 狂者라 칭하엿다. 一日은 隣人이 장군의 빈한한 것을 불상이 녁여 경지를 대여하고 장군으로 하여금 경작을 하라 하엿더니 장군은 田을 耕하다가 병이 낫다고 詐稱하고 경지를 隣人에게 還付하고 謝禮하니 隣人이 더욱 불상이 녁여 자기가 대신으로 田을 耕하매 장군은 눈을 감고 壟上에 누어 兵書를 암송하다가 日暮한 후에 집으로 돌아°€니 隣人이 참으로 병이 잇는 줄 알고 食物을 주며 또한 장군을 위하야 농작을 하니 이는 장군이 臨時 小計를 用함이엿다. 그 뒤에 장군은 홀로 射를 習하다가 喟然이 탄식하야 曰 내가 天地의 氣를 受하얏스되 금수가 되지 안코 인류가 되엿스며 또  인류 중에도 부인이 되지 안코 남자가 되엿스니 엇지 區區히 鄕曲에 蟄伏하야 虛生夢死하리오 하고 遂히 其 弟 嗣業과 共히 무과에 응하야 聯榜으로 登第되매 즉 時 甲山 防秋에 赴하니 장군의 時年이 25세엿다.

三尺龍泉萬卷書
甲山에 재임한 지 2년 만에 장군은 三水郡 小農堡權營으로 陞任되엿다가 未幾에 또 折衝將軍加資의 恩典을 蒙하니 이는 장군이 특히 其 地에서 軍備를 擴充한 功이 有함이오 또 장군은 小農堡 재임 중에 엇던 大池邊에 遊하다가 蛇에게 三尺의 神劒을 得하고 一首의 詩를 作하야 釰에 銘하얏스니 世人의 膾煮하는 바 「三尺龍泉萬卷書, 皇天生我意何如. 山東宰相山西將, 彼丈夫兮我丈夫」의 句가 이것이다.

獨審府庫
其 후 辛酉에(公年28) 滿秋 歸京하야 僉知中樞府事의 職에 재임하다가 甲子 李适의 亂을 當하니 이는 장군이 大功을 成할 千載一遇의 好機會엿다.(공년31) 慨然히 元師營에 赴하야 討賊하기를 자청하고 그 형 承業과 그 弟 俊業으로 더부러 鞍峴에서 力戰하고 勝戰을함에 際하야는 여러 將士가 다 行在所에 爭至하야 그 공을＜94＞ 과장하되 유독 장군은 直히 龍山에 走하야 府庫를 審査하고 散卒을 收合하엿다. 그때에 算官 金汝義가 선박으로 金厚簿書를 連搬하야 江都로 향하다가 适黨에게 被執하야 死境에 幾至한 바 장군이 또한 형제와 共히 釰을 拔하야 賊黨을 追逐하니 이로 인하야 全 財寶를 다 救得하고 金汝義도 또한 생명을 保하야 후일에 장군의 心腹人이 되얏다. 亂을 平하메 형제 二人이 다 原從 2等에 錄하고 장군은 1等에 錄하야 嘉善大夫로 陞職되엿다가 翌年 乙丑에 僉知中樞府事 겸 羽林衛將이 되더니 未久에 防踏僉使로 被任하고 그 翌年 丙寅에는 다시 樂安郡守가 되야 到任한 지 數月에 治蹟이 大著하니 인민이 다 其 덕을 頌하엿섯다.

江都講和와 將軍
그러다가 仁祖 5년 丁卯(公年34)에 胡亂이 至하니 節度使는 장군으로 左營將을 삼고자 하고 觀察使는 中軍을 삼고자 하야 일시에 檄을 幷發하고 장군을 招하니 공이 몬저 관찰사를 보고 가로대 절도사는 進前의 將이오 관찰사는 後殿에서 指揮할 따름이니 從軍하는 자가 後에 在한 것이 비록 다행하다 할지나 我는 官階가 二品에 在하야 國恩이 망극한즉 戰地에 赴하야 死로써 國을 報함이 당연하고 後殿은 원하는 바가 아니라하니 관찰사가 그 義를 尙하야 遂히 허락하엿다. 장군이 즉시 兵營에 赴하야 군을 정돈하고 道를 倍하야 江華에 至하니 時에 講和가 벌서 성립되엿는지라. 부득이 退兵하고 비분하야 曰 조정이 我에게 精砲 四萬만 주면 一月을 불과하야 가히 虜穴을 소탕하고 釰을 鴨水에 洗하고 歸하리라 하얏다. 越翌年 戊辰에 都軆察使從事官 金槃이 장군의 치적을 褒啓하니 上이 褒彰의 諭旨를 下하고 御衣 一襲를 特賜하엿섯다. 그러나 褒貶이 無常한 당시의 조정은 是年에 다시 장군의 직을 罷하고 軆察使別將을 삼엇스니 이는 公이 權奸 沈器遠에게 節扇을 送치 안이함으로 沈賊이 言官에게 囑하야 장군을 搆誣論劾함이엿다. 其 후 己巳에 다시 龍驤衛副護軍이 되엿다가 庚午에 平安監司閔聖微의 啓請으로 平壤中軍이 되고(時明假島都督劉興治. 暗通北虜, 咸脅我國, 公以計送方伯于都督府革罷諸弊無事而歸方伯以公稱古之諸葛) 辛未에(公年38) 또 釰山 防禦使로 被任하야 凌漢, 雲暗, 龍骨諸城을 築할새 公이 몸소 役을 執하고 종일토록 士卒로 더부러 勞苦를 가티 하야 不日에 工을 竣하니 上이 특히 그 공을 嘉하야 御馬 一匹을 賜하엿다. (재임시에 明總兵 劉興治가 詐降淸兵 三百人으로 더부러 淸에 投코자 하다 가 部下에게 피살하고 其 降兵이 公의 營에 來奔하니 公이 몬저 氣를 望하고 *垣을 預히 수리하엿다 가물치 안이하고 因하엿더니 후에 淸兵이 起兵하야 其 兵을 來索하매＜95＞ 장군이 還給하야 其 禍를 면하얏다.)

將軍頭邊御賜花
仁祖 11년 癸酉엿다.(公時年40) 때에 邊警이 日로 급하매 平安監司와 都元師가 다 啓하되 西邊의 事는 林某가 안이면 可禦치 못한다 하니 上이 특명으로 장군을 召하야 (公時以父喪在家) 淸北防禦使 겸 寧邊府使를 拜하고 義州城牒과 白馬山城을 築케 하더니 그 時에 明의 叛賊 孔有德, 耿仲明이 牛家庄에 來屯하야 間間히 虜兵과 共히 국경을 犯하거늘 장군이 兵을 擧하야 擊破하니 明帝가 大嘉하야 특히 摠兵을 拜하고 또 金花를 賜하야 頭에 挿케하니 內外가 다 그 功을 稱賞하고 邊境이 또한 晏然하엿다. 그해 冬期에 邊患이 寢定됨으로 장군은 職을 辭하고 귀가하야 喪을 守하다가 翌年 甲戍에 다시 義州府尹 겸 淸北防禦使로 被任되야 常平倉을 設한 功으로 嘉義에 陞職되엿더니 未幾에 微事로 罪에 坐하야 官職의 削奪를 당하엿다.(以不殺*使之故言官論劾)

復拜義州府尹
仁祖 14년 丙子春에 이르러 조정이 다시 장군의 職을 復하야 義州府尹을 삼으니 장군이 辭朝할 時에 조정에 청하야 曰 *日에 賊情을 詳察하니 南進할 機가 己著한지라 원컨대 二萬騎를 得하야 禦敵할 策을 成케 하소서 하니 조정이 불허하는 지라. 慶業이 慨然히 부임하야 鴨江의 越邊松鶻, 鳳凰兩處에 烽燧軍을 置하야 斥候를 엄히하고 또 12屯의 農穀 及 橐草를 將하야 城中에 輸入하고 疫牛 數百匹을 脯乾儲置하며 柴를 積하야 軍粮의 庫와 如히 하고 尙又 城中에 大池를 성하야 䲙魚를 養하엿다가 淸人이 來할 時에는 반듯이 그 魚를 饋하야 城의 完全難拔할 勢를 示하며 一邊으로 削髮胡服한 軍偵을 使하야 賊情을 探한 후 다시 조정에 啓하야 奇兵으로 窃發의 憂를 防하기를 청하엿더니 上이 黃海軍 二萬을 特許하니 公이 이에 大喜하야 兵使柳琳에게 謂하야 曰 我가 二萬兵이 有하면 엇지 賊을 畏하리오. 賊이 비록 入境할지라고 對戰치 안이하고 곳 重兵으로 其 國을 衝한다하면 彼가 歸去할지며 또한 萬里外에 長驅한 兵馬가 필연 大困할지라 我가 精軍으로써 靑城 檜嶺 兩地에 列陣하얏다가 機를 乘하야 공격하면 이는 以一當百의 妙策이라하더니 未幾에 諫官이 또 言하되 重兵을 邊臣에게 屬함이 不可하다하야 事가 遂히 停止하게 되니 이는 千載痛恨의 事라 云치 안이치 못하겟다.

丙子胡亂과 將軍＜96＞

是에 先하야 조정이 淸人의 意를 逆한 事가 有하매 問責의 冠가 有할가 恐하야 장군으로 하야금 賊情을 探케하니 公이 自思하되 조정이 적의 怒를 買하얏슨즉 來寇할 것은 필연의 事라하고 이에 通事의 淸地에 送하며 戒하야 曰 中路에서 賊兵을 遇하야 만일 白馬山城의 일을 問하거던 八員將師가 각기 三營을 率하고 境上에 來屯하얏스며 軍器는 去年부터 鳥銃과 彈丸을 具備하고 軍糧은 산과 如하고 城中에 大池가 有하야 魚類가 豐産하다고 答하라하더니 通事가 通遠堡에 至하야 과연 적군을 遇하야 公의 言과 如히 語하니 적이 가로대 今에 아군이 白馬山城을 屠할지라 만일 汝言이 有違하면 곳 汝를 殺하리라 하고 通事를 載來하엿섯다. 12월 초 6일이다. 鳳凰, 松鶻의 兩烽火가 일시에 幷擧하매 公이 급히 都元師 金自點에게 馳報하야 賊變을 防禦하라 하얏더니 自點이 泰然不顧하고 조정에 告치 안이하얏슴으로 적이 近畿에 침입한 후에야 비로소 知하고 大駕가 蒼皇히 南漢에 入하얏다가 遂히 城下의 辱을 당하게 되얏스니 自點의 通天罪逆이야 엇지 千斬한들 가히 贖할 수 잇스랴. 慶業은 是보다 先하야 白布帳을 多設하더니 적이 境內에 침입함에 際하야 城上에 連布하니 遠望하매 粉牒과 如하고 또 城牒에는 石塊를 多積하야 老弱男女로 하야금 守備케 하며 매 三堞에 一土室을 築하고 土室中에는 각기 數斗酒를 釀하야 三堞守軍으로 交代 휴식하되 飮酒防寒케 하고 前日 積置한 牛脯로 軍中에 餉하니 歡聲이 地를 動하더라. 賊어 江을 越하야 京城으로 直向하거늘 公이 屯田兵을 点視하니 僅히 八百의 弱卒뿐이라. 이에 天을 仰하고 大歎하야 曰 無兵의 將師가 엇지하리오 하고 因하야 足을 頓하며 悲泣하다가 다시 行師를 緩코 자 하야 人으로 하야금 그 軍을 饋하고 追問하야 曰 何故로 今行에 車馬가 그다지 多하며 또 邊將이 이에 잇거늘 엇지 一言이 無하고 直히 京師로 向하느냐 하니 적이 답하되 貴國의 정부와 직접 교섭할 事가 잇슨즉 邊將은 關與할 바가 안이라 하고 長驅不止하엿섯다.

鴨綠江上斬要魋
적이 연일 越江하야 6일에 京師를 犯하더니 未幾에 西路 諸鎭이 그 後를 絶할가 恐하야 猛將要魋로 하야금 精兵 300을 率하고 그 國으로 還하니 要魋의 爲人이 용맹하야 雪色의 二重鐵衣를 着하고 馬를 躍하야 陣에 臨하매 沿路諸軍이 다 望風畏㥘야 敢 近치 못하는 지라 慶業이 單騎로 直馳 突擊하야 압록강 氷上에 追至하야 要魋를 馬下에 斬하고 그 衆을 盡殺한 후 鐵衣兩重을 脫하야 着하니 重이＜97＞ 百斤이더라. 其후에 賊이 南漢으로부터 歸하는 路次에 公에게 詰問하야 曰 「네가 要魋를 殺하얏느냐」하니 公이 答曰 「然하다. 國恩을 深蒙하고 久히 邊境에 在하니 곳 국가의 重任이라 엇지 邊境을 侵하는 적을 不殺하리오」 賊 曰 「我軍이 初來할 時에는 엇지 공격치 안이하얏느뇨」 公 曰 「寡가 衆을 敵치 못할지라 汝手에 虛死하면 國恩을 報키 難하겟기로 지금까지 인내하얏노라」 賊 曰 「前에 擊치 안음은 당연하거니와 今에 擊치 안이함은 何故오」하니 公이 愀然히 流涕하야 曰 國運이 불행하야 城下의 恥를 당하고 또 왕자 大君이 다 汝軍 中에 잇는 고로 엇지할 수 업는 까닭이라 하니 賊이 그 義를 感하더라.

처음에 賊이 京師를 侵할 時에 장군은 또 蠟書로 병사 柳琳에게 告하야 曰 敵이 久留의 計가 有하고 군왕이 孤城에 受圍하매 退敵의 計가 無하니 만일에 병사가 余에게 一萬兵만 與하면 直히 瀋陽을 襲하야 一擧에 그 巢窟을 滅할지니 이는 孫矉이 魏都에 直走하야 韓을 구하던 計라 하엿더니 琳이 본래 장군의 공을 忌하는 고로 또한 聽치 안이하야 大事가 遂히 非하엿다.

軍前泣送洪學士
翌年 丁丑에 學士 洪翼漢이 斥和臣으로 被執되야 瀋陽으로 入할새 監押官 邊大中이(其時 甑山縣令) 學士의 兩掌을 繩으로 貫하고 結縛을 甚酷하게 하얏스되 沿路 守宰가 다 恐惶하야 敢言치 못하더니 유독 장군이 中途에 出迎하얏다가 此를 見하고 憤然 曰 洪公은 我國의 충신이라 엇지 取히 이가티 虐遇하느뇨 하고 친히 그 縛을 解하고 手를 執하며 語하야 曰 明公의 此行은 참으로 남자의 事이라 生하야는 가히 천하에 愧치 안코 死하야는 名이 竹帛에 垂하리라 하고 供奉을 심히 厚하게하며 路贐을 극히 厚給하엿섯다. 丁丑 이후로 장군은 항상 明國과 潛通하야 大事를 擧코자하나 그 人을 得치 못하더니 香山 僧 獨步(俗姓名申歇)가 義氣의 남자라는 名을 聞하고 厚弊로 誼를 結한 후 崔完城鳴吉, 李延陽時白과 상의하야 獨步를 明의 石城島에 送하야 信을 通하기 始하엿다. 其 후 장군은 寃罪에 坐하야 또 鐵山에 定配되엿더니 仁祖 18년 庚辰 春에 淸人이 明의 錦州를 攻코자하야 我國에 請兵하매 조정이 장군의 配를 解하고 舟師上將을 삼으니 장군이 副將 李浣으로 더부러 戰地로 향하다가 中路에서 飄風하엿다 稱하고 人을 明軍에 送하야 그 應變의 意를 通하고 6월에 盖州에 至하야는 明船 40隻을 遇하야 피차 丸을 去하고 총을 放하며 簇을 棄하고 矢를 放하야 長跱＜98＞ 相戰하다가 거짓 敗하고 歸하니 淸將이 疑를 懷하고 此를 發見코자 하야 그 군을 分하야 遠方에 陣을 布하되 明兵의 狀을 粧하니 公이 또 그 謀를 預히 知하고 毒矢猛丸으로 亂射하야 淸兵을 大殺하니 淸將이 奈何치 못하야 本國으로 환송하엿다. 其 時에 장군은 또 수영 잘하는 자를 모집하야 明軍에 往하야 본국의 사정을 通하고 明帝의 討淸親詔를 受하니 장군읊� 기묘한 謀策은 비록 神鬼라도 可測키 難하엿다.

名馬愛妾視之如芥
그러나 仁祖 20년 壬午(公年49)에 불행이 明의 錦州가 함락되고 左都督 洪承疇가 淸에 降하야 그 부하가 慶業과 밀통하던 事를 告하고 또 定州人 高忠元이 瀋獄에 係하야 慶業의 獨步送往하던 事를 言하니 淸廷이 大怒하야 我國에 問責하고 崔相鳴吉과 장군을 執送하라하니 이로부터 장군의 운명은 더욱 崎嶇多端하엿다. 12월에 장군은 朝令에 依하야 그 첩 梅環과 二奴를 다리고 京城을 떠나 黃海道 金郊驛에 至하얏다가 夜半에 天을 仰하고 탄식 曰 天이 남자를 生하얏슴에 반듯시 소용이 잇슬 것이니 엇지 홀연히 *延에 처하야 徒死의 鬼가 되리오 차라리 死할지마는 *******을 다하야 兩子의 恥를 雪하고 壬辰의 恩를 報한 후 鶴駕를 東還케 함이 可하겟다 하고 이에 梅環을 顧하야 曰 너는 楊州許道의 家에 往匿하야 禍를 면하라 하고 (後果免禍) 장군은 釰을 杖하고 楊州 檜巖寺에 往하야 그 衣服을 留置한 후 抱川 加平郡界에 至하야 또 所騎한 愛馬를 棄하고 髮을 削하야 僧이 된 후 江原道 楊口縣에 入하야 엇던 草幕에서 過冬하니 誰가 능히 前日의 林장군인 줄을 알엇스랴.

孤身尺釰入虎穴
이로부터 장군은 혹 江湖에 䀲跡하고 혹 知舊에 托身하야 四方으로 漂泊하다가 癸未 2월에 (時公年50) 高陽郡 幸州에 至하야 公의 知己友 李小元(一名武金商業)과 共謀하고 海美 상인朴守元, 車再龍, 李成南을 結하야 曰 엇던 富豪僧이 평안도에 輸穀을 하랴하는데 汝等이 船卜을 載하면 高賃을 給하리라 하니 諸商이 다 信之無疑하고 舟를 서해에 航하더니 海州 延平島에 至하야 公이 裝中에서 釰을 出하야 船頭를 斫하고 大呼 曰 我는 林兵使라 하니 衆이 다 驚懼하야 그 令을 敢違치 못하엿다. 그러나 행인지 불행인지 중도에서 忽然이 狂風을 遇하야 舟가 明國의 海豊縣에 飄泊하니 縣人이 淸人으로 疑하고 살해코자 하다가 다시 林장군인 줄 알고 獄에 보류한 후 ＜99＞ 布政司에 馳報하더니 때에 마침 明摠兵 黃宗裔가 登州에 鎭하얏다가 장군의 係獄된 事를 知하고 人을 送하야 獄을 破하고 장군을 迎하야 上賓으로 待하고 國事를 상의하더니 (時明帝亦命留登州) 甲申 4월에 李自成이 明의 國都를 함락하매 宗裔가 馬弘周로 그 職을 代케하고 身을 脫하야 亂에 赴하니 此는 장군의 一大不幸이엿다. 事가 此에 至함에 장군은 부득이 馬弘周의 鎭에 在하야 다시 後機를 待하더니 未幾에 山海關이 또 失守되고 淸主가 燕京을 據하니 弘周가 또한 淸에 降코자 하거늘 장군이 그 意를 知하고 夜를 乘하야 逃走코자 하다가 獨步의 漏說로 인하야 遂意치 못하고 乙酉 정월에 馬賊이 公을 執하야 淸에 降하니 公이 遂히 燕獄에 送致되엿다. (其 時에 淸兵이 馬弘周와 及 그 將士의 髮을 다 削하고 또 장군의 髮을 削코자 하다가 장군이 厲聲大叱하니 적이 敢犯치 못하엿다)

鳴呼 國事未定身先死
公이 燕獄에 在한지 凡 18朔間에 적이 百方의 利說로 勸誘하되 장군이 扺死不屈하니 賊이 其 義에 感하야 甚至於 涕淚를 下하더라. 其 후 丙戍에 正使 李景奭과 副使 金堉等이 燕京에 往하얏다가 公의 送還을 請하야 귀국하게 되매 조정이 壬午亡命의 罪로 縷絏에 繫하야 京師로 押上하니 沿路의 人民이 悲泣치 안는 자가 업섯다. (時公尙着朝鮮服而亦未削髮) 先是 金自點이 장군와 宿憾이 잇고 (自點以淸北地廣人稀勢難固守欲割讓子淸, 將軍力排其論, 淸北人民亦詣關上訴未遂其志自點愧之因怨將軍) 또 異志를 抱하되 장군을 忌憚하야 敢行치 못함으로 기회만 잇스면 반듯시 公을 害코자 하더니 (先年李未壬申兩歲欲搆罪將軍未果又入燕時力勸淸主欲殺害將軍未得) 이에 또 장군을 誣訴하야 甲申年 沈器遠逆謀에 관련이 有하다 力言하니 (時南以雄雖辯護將軍未得其效) 上이 親鞠하다가 寃枉이 有할가 恐하야 再三疑訝하고 獄에 下하더니 自點이 다시 獄官을 暗囑하야 嚴刑을 가하니 장군이 大呼 曰 國事를 尙히 未定하고 엇지 輕然히 我를 殺하느뇨 하고 竟히 獄中에서 死하니 時는 仁祖 24년 丙戍 6월 20일이오 장군의 年은 53세엿다.

草木猶知將軍寃
尋常한 一婦가 寃을 含하야도 五月에 霜이 飛하거던 況且 貫日의 精忠인 장군이 寃死함에 엇지 草木인들 그 寃을 知치 못하리오. 장군의 ­»日로부터 3일간은 草木이다. 枯凋하야 重霜을 被함과 如하얏고 또 장군의 愛馬는 太廏에 잇다가 御者가 장군의 死함을 告하매 數日을 掇食哀鳴하다가 死하얏스며 (公有名騅日行干里能超數十丈亡命時脫勒棄野後流入太僕至是御者告以主人之死馬遂悲鳴不食而死)＜100＞ 算官 金汝義는 장군의 屍를 撫하고 痛哭하다가 幾히 氣盡하고 棺槨과 歛衣를 厚備하며 文을 製하야 祭하고 其 외 京鄕 婦幼老少까지 悲泣치 안이하는 자가 업섯다. 其 후 肅宗丁丑에 至하야 (公沒後50년) 公의 子 重蕃이 䟽를 上하야 비로소 寃을 伸한 후 다시 官을 復하고 또 丙戍에는 忠愍이라 賜謚하고 (盛衰純固曰忠在國逢難曰„) 庚寅에는 義州 儒生이 建議하야 白馬山城에 院을 設하고 (義州又有顯忠祠) 英宗丙午에는 湖西 儒生이 達川에 忠烈祠를 창건하고 遺像을 奉安하야 今日에까지 至하얏다.

臨機善變하는 將軍의 智謀
장군은 군중에 在할 때에 士卒로 더부러 甘苦를 가티하야 전후 十餘 城을 築할 때에 친히 土石을 負하고 版鍾을 操하며 人이 功罪가 有하면 비록 細少하나 반듯시 상벌을 분명히 하고 죄를 治한 후에는 또 반듯시 招致하야 酒食을 厚饋하고 懇切히 慰論함으로 刑杖이 비록 過猛하야도 惡言하는 자가 업섯스며 또 부하를 대함에 機密籠絡이 甚히 多하야 人에게 賜與를 하면 절대 비밀에 付하야 互相不知케 함으로 각각 자기를 偏厚하게 하는 줄로 知하야 다 心腹이며 되는 故로 비록 宅地에 한하야 또 樂從하고 尙又 臨機善變하야 虜賊을 대할 때에 항상 奇計로 籠絡하니 百에 一失이 업섯다. 그가 龍灣에 在할 때에 忽然히 所帶한 一矢를 失하엿더니 公이 벌서 虜將의 所爲인줄 知하고 즉시 善盜하는 者를 택하야 虜陣에 가서 虜主의 所着한 紅帽를 取하야 藏하얏다가 其후 虜將이 公所에 至하야 장군의 失하엿든 矢를 前에 投하매 장군은 역시 紅帽를 虜前에 投하니 虜가 慚愧하야 다시 頡頏치 못하더라. 其 후에 賊은 또 相者로 하야금 公貌를 相察하니 장군이 知하고 脯肉을 靴中에 入한 후 立하니 相者가 見하야 曰 만일에 一寸만 短하얏더면 천하 명장의 相이라 하고 其時로부터 가해코자 안이하엿다. 또 丙子 후에 淸官의 왕래하는 자가 그 弊가 多하야 郡邑이 심히 곤란하더니 장군은 淸主에게 一鈴을 得하야 軍中에 令하고 淸人의 犯過하는 者면 일일이 嚴刑하니 其 弊가 遂絶하엿다. (餘不盡記)

忠孝烈을 兼全한 將軍의 夫人과 其 兄
충신은 효자의 門에 잇다더니 장군의 가문이야말로 참 世世武將이오 또 忠烈이다. 父篁은 折衛, 祖德胤은 武科部將, 曾祖有名은 司憲府監察, 九代祖는 李朝刑曹判書 겸 西北面都巡問察理使恭惠公整이오 그 부인은 鎭安大君의 八世孫이니 장군이 亡命한 후 역시 虜獄에 被因되엿다가＜101＞ 적의 惡刑을 忍치 못하야 天을 仰하고 大呼하야 曰 夫는 東國의 충신이오 余는 충신의 妻니 엇지 참아 大豖에게 辱을 見하야 良人의 忠節을 汚하리오. 당연이 지하의 良人을 從하야 가티 조선의 鬼가 되리라 하고 佩刀를 引하야 자살하니 虜主가 감탄하야 그 喪을 禮送하얏고 또 장군의 第三兄 亨業은 (公有兄弟七人) 본래 出天의 효자로서 丙子亂時에 적이 침입하되 母柩를 抱하고 避치 안이하니 賊이 其 효에 感하야 「孝人不可害」라는 標木을 立하고 去하얏스며 (亨業隨兄承業在孟山任所時) 其 후 壬午년에 慶業의 事로 虜獄에 被囚하얏슬 時에는 賊이 拜跪하기를 力脅하되 終是 不屈하고 腹을 披하며 吾心을 剖觀하라 하고 罵叱하더니 旣歸에 科業을 全廢하고 田園에 屛居하엿섯다.

筆을 擲하면서
우리의 역사가 잇슨 지 반만년 동안에 世代로 名將이 乏絶치 안이하얏스되 이 林장군과 가티 철두철미하게 爲國盡忠하다가 최후에 그 몸까지 寃抑히 死한 人은 업섯다. 장군은 조정의 신임도 업고 권위도 업고 내외의 應援도 업고 또 時運도 不遇하얏다. 뿐만 안이라 四圍의 權奸이 항상 忌惡하고 咀呪하얏다. 그러되 少毫도 怨尤치 안이하며 屈撓치 안이하고 다만 一片의 赤忠으로 국가를 위하야 盡瘁할 뿐이엿다. 그가 일개 邊將으로 殘城孤軍을 가지고 强大의 北虜를 守禦하되 10여년에 一毫의 失策이 업고 隻身短釰으로 萬里異國을 橫踏하되 無人의 境과 如히 한것을 보면 그의 智謀兵略이 如何히 神妙하고 膽勇이 如何히 夥大한 것을 推知할 것이오. 또 亡命 중에 그의 총애하던 美妾과 名馬를 草芥와 如히 棄하고 부모의 遺髮을 削하고 僧이 되며 燕獄에 在할 때에 虜主가 封爵封侯로 利誘하되 단연 거절하고 臨死時에도 國事를 未定에 將帥를 엇지 輕殺하느냐고 한것을 보면 그의 貞忠大節이 如何히 熱烈한 것을 可測할 것이다. 그는 國을 위하야 鞠躬盡瘁하다가 其 身이 非命에 死하고 그의 부인도 또한 萬里異域에서 殉死하엿스며 그의 愛馬까지도 장군을 위하야 殉死하고 형제친척도 옥에 繫하야 萬苦를 喫盡하얏스니 그 얼마나 壯烈하고 悲憤하냐. 장군은 丁卯亂時에 일즉이 虜都를 直擊하랴고 精砲四萬을 청하얏다가 조정이 불허하야 여의치 못하고 또 丙子亂時에도 虜都를 直擊하랴고 兵使 柳琳에게 一萬兵을 청하다가 그 亦 不聽하야 군신이 城下의 恥를 受하게 되엿다.＜102＞ 만일에 仁祖가 조금이라도 明哲한 知鑑이 잇서서 장군을 신임하얏더면 丙子亂이 起하기 전에 미리 防備하엿슬 것이오 비록 亂이 起할지라도 그다지 恥 辱은 당하지 안엇슬 것이다.
그러나 仁祖는 능히 장군을 知치 못하고 奸賊을 신임하다가 國事를 誤하고 또 장군의 冤罪를 知하면서도 孤疑不斷하야 枉死에 至케 하얏스니 엇지 후세에 暗君이라는 譏를 가히 면하랴. 이로 미루어보면 甲子의 适亂과 丙子南漢의 辱은 仁祖가 자초하얏다 하야도 과언이 안일것 갓다. 其 후 孝宗은 또 北伐의 壯志가 有하야 宋時烈, 李浣 등을 신임하고 인물을 旁求하얏스되 장군의 寃은 능히 伸치 못하얏스니 엇지 明君이라 可謂하랴. 許生과 如한 高士가 隱遯한 것도 寧히 당연의 事가 云치 안이치 못하겟다. 그리고 후세에 장군의 傳記를 述하는 者가 그 數가 甚多하얏스나 대개 尊周的 奴隷主義에 중독되야 이구동성으로 장군을 贊하되 曰 大明忠臣 曰 皇朝陪臣 운운하야 장군의 일생 盡瘁가 모다 明國을 위하야 함과 如히 하얏스니 이것이 엇지 장군에 대한 유감이 아니랴. 장군이 卒逝한 지 280여년이 된 今日에 당시 장군의 讎敵으로 천하막강하던 淸제국은 이미 멸망하야 宣統의 幼帝가 天津一隅에서 漂流悲泣하고 君權萬能으로 忠良을 是害하고 奸凶을 是信하던 XX의 社稷도 벌서 禾黍가 離離하니 비록 지하에 잇는 장군이라도 往事를 회고하면 실로 감개무량하야 悲喜의 淚가 交流할 것이다.
噫, 白馬의 秋草는 無心이 푸르고 鴨綠의 長波는 滾滾이 흐르는데 萬古遺恨을 抱한 장군은 白雲의 鄕에 영원히 遊하야 形影이 沓然하고 다만 達川의 南原에 一坏塚이 홀로 잇서 秋風秋雨에 草樹가 悲凉할 뿐이니 비록 剛腸의 男兒인들 엇지 滿襟의 熱淚을 禁할 수 잇스랴.＜103＞
