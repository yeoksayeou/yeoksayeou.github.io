Annals of the Three Great Internal Strife of Joseon, Yi Si-ae's Revolt by the Hero of Gwanbuk, the First Rebel of the Hanyang Dynasty
						Sushun-hakjin

The Figures of Brothers-in-law

Fourteen years after Yi Cheong-ok, who called himself the Great Jin Emperor, met his tragic end at the head of the Duman River at the young age of 24, harboring a thousand years of regret, another major revolt broke out in Gwanbuk: the Revolt of Yi Si-ae, the former magistrate of Hoeryeong. Yi Si-ae was originally from Gilju. He was brave, chivalrous, intelligent, and fond of archery and horsemanship since childhood, excelling in martial arts. People called him the second Yi Seong-gye. His younger brothers, Si-bak and Si-hap, were also figures not inferior to Si-ae. The three brothers all passed the military examination (武科) and once served under Yi Cheong-ok. Cheong-ok admired their martial prowess and especially favored them, often saying, "If my brothers (Cheong-ok and his elder brother Cheong-seok) and your three brothers can unite, we can conquer not only the Jurchens but also the entirety of China as easily as turning our hands over." The Jurchens also feared his martial might and always warned each other, "The three tigers of the Yi family are untouchable." When they went out on horseback, they dared not resist and fled beyond the borders. <2> Then, in the first year of King Danjong (癸丑), when Yi Cheong-ok, harboring the ambition to become the Great Jin Emperor, raised an army but unfortunately failed midway (see the previous issue of this magazine), they feared the repercussions and resigned from their military posts, returning to their hometowns to spend their days hunting or farming.

The Motives for Starting the Revolt

Later, Si-ae was reappointed as the magistrate of Hoeryeong. However, he bitterly resented the unjust death of Yi Cheong-ok and always lamented the unjust actions of the court at that time. Moreover, although the Yi dynasty originated in Hamgyeong Province, they were suspicious and treated the people of Hamgyeong Province, the very birthplace of the dynasty, poorly, preventing them from participating in key government positions. He harbored even greater dissatisfaction, always thinking to himself, "Whether it's the royal Yi family or me, we are all Yis from Hamgyeong Province. Yi Taejo was no different from me, just a military man. Since they fortunately seized the throne of Joseon, it is only natural that they treat my hometown, Hamgyeong Province, at least the same as other provinces, if not with special favor. Nevertheless, it's truly like a frog despising a tadpole, treating us Hamgyeong Province people worse than anyone else. Even within their so-called royal family, fathers and sons fight each other (referring to Yi Taejo), and uncles and nephews commit regicide (referring to Sejo), unjustly killing meritorious subjects based on the false accusations of treacherous officials. Who can live with peace of mind? If that's the case, I might as well raise the banner of revolt. If I succeed, I will become the second Yi Taejo, and if I fail, I will flee across the border to fulfill Yi Cheong-ok's dying wish and become the Great Jin Emperor." However, it was difficult to act rashly in such times. Moreover, Heo Jong (許悰), the Hamgil Province Military Commissioner (咸吉道節度使) at the time, was a great figure with both literary and military skills, and his prestige was widespread both internally and externally. The general public greatly trusted him, so how could Yi Si-ae, even with his great ambitions, act rashly? He only harbored ten thousand kinds of discontent in his heart. Just then, he suffered a parental mourning, so he resigned from his position and returned to his hometown to live in a hut.

Beheading the Military Commissioner with a Beauty Trap

At that time, Military Commissioner Heo Jong also resigned from his position due to mourning, and Kang Hyo-mun (康孝文) replaced him. Hyo-mun was the son of Kang Yeo-jung (汝中), the former Vice Minister of Rites (禮曹參判). He was arrogant and licentious. From the beginning of his tenure, he indulged in wine and women and did not properly attend to government affairs, so the people's resentment grew daily, and everyone had thoughts of causing a civil disturbance. Yi Si-ae, seeing this opportunity, although in mourning, seized the moment to raise the banner of revolt, which was his lifelong ambition. When making all kinds of plans, he first tried to incite popular sentiment. He sent dozens or hundreds of his followers in all directions to spread rumors, saying, "The court has always mistreated the people of Hamgyeong Province, and now they are especially trying to massacre the people of this province. They are sending troops from the three southern provinces by land and sea to advance together. The warships from Chungcheong Province have already arrived and are concentrated on Hurado Island in Gyeongseong, and the troops from Hwanghae and Pyeongan Provinces are crossing Seolhan Pass (or Seokhan Pass) to engage in mutual slaughter from front and back." The people's hearts were greatly agitated, and even Governor (觀察使) Oh Eung (吳凝) believed the rumors and instructed each county magistrate (守令) to evacuate to the mountains. At that time, Yi Si-ae secretly rejoiced at the success of his plan. When Military Commissioner Kang Hyo-mun was on patrol in Gilju, he conspired with his younger brother Si-hap and used a beauty trap. He had Kim Cho-seon (金貂蟬), the daughter of Si-hap's concubine, who was a famous gisaeng in the province with both singing and dancing skills, serve Hyo-mun at his bedside, and then have her open the door to welcome him in. Then, he declared that the Military Commissioner was plotting a revolt with several garrison commanders (鎭將), and under cover of night, he shouted loudly and attacked the government office (州衙). Cho-seon, who was in Hyo-mun's room, heard the military signal and immediately opened the gate to let Si-ae in. Si-ae entered and beheaded Hyo-mun and Seol Cheong-sin (薜澄新), the magistrate (牧使) of Gilju, with a single stroke. He then occupied the city and commanded the county. This was in the fifth month of the summer of the twelfth year of King Sejo (丁亥). Si-ae then declared that Hyo-mun was conspiring with Shin Jae (申㴐), the Governor (觀察使) of Hamheung, and his father, Suk-ju (叔舟), to shake the people's hearts, so he had them executed. He also sent his followers to the court to report that the people of each camp were afraid of being massacred by foreign troops (外道兵), so they were spreading false rumors. If people from this province were not appointed as magistrates in each county within the province to stabilize the people's hearts, it would not work. The court did not know the truth, so they asked Seong I-geon (成以乾), a military officer (軍官) of Hoeryeong, about Yi Si-ae's actions. Seong I-geon was also deceived by Si-ae's scheme and strongly defended Yi Si-ae's loyalty to the country and concern for the people (忠國爲民). The court was only half convinced.

Conquering More Than Ten Counties in One Night

After deceiving the people above and below in this way, Si-ae sent his associates to each county to spread rumors, saying that if governors and inspectors from other provinces held positions within Hamgyeong Province, the people in the jurisdiction would soon be massacred at their hands, so they had to act quickly. More than ten counties north of Hamheung killed their magistrates and responded in one night.
Si-ae then proclaimed himself the Military Commissioner of Hamgil Province (施吉道節度使), personally commanding the troops of each county. He set up his headquarters in Gilju and advanced south with unstoppable force, occupying Dancheon. When he reached Iseong (present-day Iwawon), he killed the county magistrate (縣監), took his wife as a concubine, and occupied the coastal counties of Bukcheong and Hongwon in succession. Si-ae's followers in Hamheung also incited the residents, surrounded and killed Governor Shin Jae, and then beheaded royal emissary (宣諭使) Son Wuk (孫旭). In just a few days, the entire Gwanbuk became Yi Si-ae's domain. Having succeeded unexpectedly in this way, Si-ae further solidified his base by appointing his confidants as magistrates in each county, touring the provinces to pacify the people, opening the granaries to relieve the poor, opening the prison gates to release the prisoners, and proclaiming everywhere that Han Myeong-hoe, Shin Suk-ju, Kwon Ram, No Sa-sin, Han Gye-hui, and others, who were highly respected in the court and countryside at the time, would occupy Gyeongseong without bloodshed, so the people all believed and shouted "Manse" (Long Live!) to Military Commissioner Yi.
Until then, the court did not know the details of Si-ae's revolt, so they did not take it seriously. However, as the border reports became more urgent and rumors that Han Myeong-hoe, Shin Suk-ju, and other important officials were internal collaborators spread throughout the capital, Sejo was greatly surprised and angered. He first detained more than ten key officials, including Han Myeong-hoe and Shin Suk-ju, in the palace, and imprisoned their sons-in-law in the capital (禁府) (these people were later released after the false accusations were proven). He then appointed Prince Gwiseong (龜城君) Jun as Supreme Commander (都摠使), and Jo Seok-mun (曹錫文), the Minister of Finance (戶曹判書), as Deputy Supreme Commander. He personally summoned Heo Jong, who was in mourning, and appointed him as the Military Commissioner of Hamgil Province, and selected Kang Sun, Eo Yu-so, Nam I, and others as generals. He mobilized 30,000 troops from the six provinces to gather in Hamheung, and placed Kang Sun, Nam I, and 28 others under Seok-mun's command, sending them immediately to Yeongheung. This was the first time since the founding of the Yi dynasty that a large army from the six provinces was mobilized at once, and it was rare in the history of the Yi dynasty's internal strife that more than 20 famous literary and military figures were dispatched at the same time.

Fierce Battle of Manryeong at the Last Moment

However, Supreme Commander Yi Jun was still only an 18-year-old youth. Five days after leaving the capital, he only reached Cheorwon and sent the blame back to the Gangwon Governor (江原監司) for his poor road maintenance, only killing the Governor and delaying the time. (He reached Hwaeyang after 15 days, and a report came that the rebellion had already been suppressed, so he returned his troops. Outwardly, it was Yi Jun's delay, but in fact, the country was empty at the time, and false rumors were also spreading in the two southern provinces, so Sejo secretly ordered him to delay.) Choe Yun-son (崔潤孫) of Dancheon, received a secret order from the court and went to persuade Si-ae, but instead sided with Si-ae and told him all the secrets of the court. Not only were several things unfavorable to the government army, but because the people were agitated by the rumors and all sided with Si-ae, the government army initially dared not engage in battle. Military Commissioner Heo Jong, Royal Emissary (體察使) Yun Ja-un (尹子雲), and Governor (觀察使) Eo Se-gong (魚世恭) devoted all their efforts to stabilizing the people's hearts and trying to appease them. However, Yi Si-ae rejected all attempts at appeasement by the government army and concentrated his forces further. In the first battle at Hongwon, the Yi army always launched night attacks, greatly troubling the government army. In the second battle at Bukcheong, there were heavy casualties on both sides, but there was no clear victory or defeat. In the third battle at Manryeong, Yi Si-ae's army was defeated. This battle of Manryeong was the largest battle between the two armies in this rebellion, and Yi's army's defeat was a fatal blow to them.
Initially, Yi Si-ae occupied the dangerous and high ground of Manryeong and attacked the government army from below. Arrows and stones rained down, and 80-90% of the government army's soldiers died, making it impossible to attack uphill. Heo Jong had Eo Yu-so take several thousand elite troops by sea to occupy the upper peak of Manryeong. He made the soldiers' clothing the same color as the vegetation, and like ants and squirrels, they clung to the trees and relied on the rocks. Suddenly, they beat the drums and attacked the Yi army. The Yi army was greatly surprised and lost its formation. The government army below also responded and attacked from above and below. Yi Jong-saeng (李從生), the vanguard commander of the government army, also bravely fought fiercely, and the Yi army could not resist and fled. However, until then, the rebel army's strength was still very strong, so the government army dared not pursue them.
Here, I will briefly introduce the story of Cha Un-geok (車云革), a civil militia general (民間義兵將) of Yeoncheon. He was the nephew of Cha Won-jo (車原頫), a loyal and virtuous official of the late Goryeo dynasty. He was exiled to Hoeryeong at the beginning of the new dynasty. Just as Si-ae's revolt broke out, he conspired with Jo Gyu (曹紏) of Bupyeong, Jeong Hyu-myeong (鄭休明) of Jongseong, and Park Seong-jang (朴成章) of Jongseong to raise troops loyal to the king. Sejo admired him and especially appointed him as the vanguard commander. He, at the old age of 75, personally went into battle, cutting off the Mayun Pass Road, which Yi's army was using to advance south. He also lured and captured Yi Si-bak and Yi Si-hap, sending them to the government army. However, Vice Commander Choe Yun-son colluded with Yi Si-ae, seized Yi Si-bak and his brother and sent them back, and instead captured Un-geok and his party, imprisoning them in the jail of Dancheon. They died of starvation in prison. However, Yi's army suffered a major blow because of this and could not advance south rapidly, and the government army occupied all the key points in the meantime, gaining a great military advantage.

Thousand Years of Regret, Ghost Gate Pass

Si-ae was greatly defeated by the government army at Manryeong, but his stubborn spirit was not at all subdued. He repeatedly rejected the government army's calls for surrender and withdrew his troops to firmly defend his headquarters in Gilju, planning to counterattack the government army again. However, by this time, the government army's power had greatly increased, and the fickle masses gradually showed a tendency to betray Si-ae as the government army's power grew. Si-ae anticipated this disadvantage and decided to cross over to the Jurchens (虜中) and make a comeback. He loaded gisaeng (妓生) and treasures and moved his troops to Gyeongseong. Until then, his subordinates did not know the details of Si-ae's revolt and only thought that the government army was coming to kill the people of Hamgyeong Province and that Si-ae was resisting it.
At that time, Heo Yu-rye (許惟禮) of Gilju came to Si-ae's camp and requested to surrender. Yu-rye was originally Yi Si-ae's brother-in-law, who had gone to Seoul and was serving as Sawongwon Byeoljwa (司甕院別座). Now that Si-ae's revolt had broken out, he wanted to achieve merit and volunteered to Sejo to report Yi Si-ae's plans. He feigned surrender. However, Si-ae and Heo were originally from the same hometown and were brothers-in-law, and his parents were also in Si-ae's camp, so how could he have suspected that he had any ulterior motives? However, disaster always comes from within. Yu-rye was most pleased that Si-ae did not suspect him and secretly persuaded Yi Un-ro (李雲露) (later recorded as Second Class Merit Subject, Janggyeonggong of Jongseong County 莊敬公), Yi Ju, Hwang Saeng, and other key subordinates of Si-ae to repent, and then conspired with them to set up a large banquet outside Ghost Gate Pass (鬼門關) and invited Si-ae. Si-ae was careless and came to enjoy himself. When he was half drunk, Yu-rye and the others tied him up as they had promised. Si-ae's brothers and his party were all captured helplessly like rats in a bag and escorted to the government army. Yi Si-ae, a hero of the age, ended up as a headless ghost outside Ghost Gate Pass, and Hamgil Province was divided into North and South Provinces for that reason. Gilju was demoted to Gilseong County (吉城縣), and Prince Gwiseong and 41 others were all recorded as Merit Subjects for their loyalty. Heo Yu-rye was also awarded the Second Class Merit, and enfeoffed as Prince Gilseong (吉城君).

Yi Si-ae's failure had several causes, but one of them was especially his indulgence in women. His taking the wife of the Iwawon County Magistrate as a concubine not only greatly damaged his reputation, but also caused him to linger there for several days, missing the opportunity to advance south. When he was about to go to the Jurchens, if he had quickly crossed the river with only his trusted soldiers, there would have been no failure at Ghost Gate Pass. But he missed the opportunity by transporting gisaengs and treasures from Gilju, and ended up dying. Those who do great things in the future - how can they not be careful about women?

朝鮮三大內亂記, 漢陽朝最初 反逆兒 關北豪傑 李施愛亂
						壽春學人
難兄難弟의 그 人物

자칭 大金皇帝 李澄玉이 千古遺恨을 품고 24세의 장년으로 두만강 머리에서 悲絶하게 최후를 맛친 지 14년을 뒤하야 關北에는 또 一大反亂이 이러낫스니 그것은 前 會寧府使 李施愛의 亂이엿다. 李施愛는 원래 吉州 사람으로 爲人이 勇悍豪俠하고 智謀가 출중하며 어렷슬 때부터 弓馬를 조와하야 무예가 또한 絶特하니 세상 사람들이 제2 李成桂라고 하얏다. 그의 아우 施伯과 施合은 또한 施愛에 不下하는 인물로 삼 형제가 공히 武科에 出身*야 일즉이 李澄玉의 幕下에 잇섯는데 澄玉은 그의 武勇을 壯하게 녁여 특히 寵愛하며 항상 갈오대 吾家형제와 (澄玉과 其兄澄石) 君家 삼 형제가 一心만 된다면 그까진 野人은 그만두고 中國의 全幅이라도 정복하기는 反掌과 갓겟다고 하고, 野人들은 또 그의 武威를 무서워하야 항상 서로 경계하되 李家三虎는 不可近이라 하고 그네가 한번 出馬한다면 敢히 대항치도 못하고 塞外로 望風逃走하얏섯다.<2> 그러다가 端宗 元年 癸丑에 李澄玉이 大金皇帝가 되겟다는 雄志를 품고 兵을 擧하다가 불행히 중도에 실패하매 (本誌 前號 참조) 그들은 몸에 禍가 밋칠가 두려워하야 다 軍職을 辭하고 本土에 도라와 혹은 수렵 혹은 농업으로 세월을 보냇섯다.

亂을 이르킨 動機

그 뒤에 施愛는 다시 擢用되야 會寧府使가 되엿스나 前日 李澄玉이 寃死한 것을 억울이 생각하야 그때 조정의 處置가 잘못된 것을 항상 憒慨할 뿐 안이라. 李氏王朝는 본래 咸鏡道에서 이러남에도 불구하고 도로혀 그 發祥之地인 咸鏡道의 인물을 猜忌 薄待하야 정부의 요직에는 한사람도 참여치 못하게 하는데 더욱 불평을 품어 언제이나 스사로 생각하기를 『王家李氏나 자기나 다 가튼 咸鏡道의 李哥요. 李太祖도 별수가 업는 자기와 同類의 武人 출신인데 그네가 다행이 朝鮮의 왕권을 차지하얏스면 자기의 고향인 咸鏡道를 특별 우대는 못할지언정 他道와 가튼 대우는 하는 것이 당연한 일이다. 그럼에도 불구하고 眞所謂 개고리(蛙)가 올챙이(蝌虯)를 멸시하는 격으로 우리 咸鏡道 사람을 누구보다도 박대하며 자기네 소위 王家에서도 父子가 相爭하고(指 李太祖) 叔侄이 弑簒을 하며(指 世祖) 까닭업는 功臣을 奸臣의 誣言에 빠저서 함부로 죽이니 누가 안심을 하고 살 수 잇스랴 찰아리 그럴진대 내가 反旗를 이르켜서 잘되면 제2 李太祖가 되고 못되면 越江逃走하야 李澄玉의 遺志를 니어 大金皇帝라도 되리라』고 하얏섯다. 그러나 때가 때인지라 큰일을 함부로 妄動하기는 어렵고 더구나 당시 咸吉道節度使 許悰은 文武를 겸비한 大人物로 威德이 내외에 普及하야 일반이 크게 신뢰하니 아모리 大志를 가진 李施愛라도 엇지 輕輕히 下手할 수 잇섯스랴. 다만 자기 심중에 萬端의 불평만 품고 잇던 중 마츰 또 親喪을 당하니 遂히 其職을 辭하고 고향에 도라와 廬幕 생활을 하게 되엿다.

美人計로 節度使를 斬殺

그때에 節度使 許悰이 또한 喪忌로 인하야 職을 辭하고 康孝文이 代住하니 孝文은 前 禮曹參判 汝中의 子로 爲人이 驕傲, 淫逸하야 到任초로부터 酒色에 浸淫하고 政事를 잘 살피지 안이하니 인민의 원성이 날로 놉하저서 누구나 한번 民擾들 이르킬 생각을 가지게 되엿섯다. 이 기회를 엿본 李施愛는 비록 喪中에 잇스나 그 시기를 타서 평생의 宿志이던 反逆의 旗를 들랴고 만반의 계획을 할 제 무엇보다도 먼저 人心을 煽動식히랴고 그의 徒黨 數十百人을 사방으로 노와 流言하되 『朝廷에서 본래 咸鏡道 사람을 박대하던 중 今般에는 특히 本道 사람을 다 殺戮하랴고 下三道 軍兵을 水陸으로 倂進케 하야 忠淸道의 兵船은 벌서 鏡城厚羅島에 와서 집중하고 黃平兩西의 兵은 雪寒嶺(或稱 薜罕嶺)을 넘어 前後로 厮殺한다 하니 人心이 크게 騷動되야 심지어 觀察使 吳凝까지도 그 流言을<3> 信聽하고 각 군 守令에게 訓示하야 다 登山避難케 하엿다. 때에 李施愛는 그 計의 맛친 것을 暗暗히 깃버하며 節度使 康孝文이 吉州에 巡廻함에 밋처서는 다시 其弟 施合과 공모하고 美人計를 쓰되 施合의 妾의 딸로서 歌舞姿色을 兼有한 당시 州中名妓 金貂蟬을 節度使에게 侍枕케 하얏다가 자기를 開門迎入케 하기로 하고 이에 聲言하야 曰 節度使가 여러 鎭將과 反逆을 謀한다 稱하고 밤을 타서 大呼吶喊하며 州衙를 襲擊하니 貂蟬이 孝文의 방에 잇다가 軍號를 듯고 즉시 衙門을 열어 施愛를 마저 드리니 施愛가 入하야 一刀로 孝文과 또 吉州牧使 薜澄新을 斬殺하고 城에 據하야 一郡을 호령하니 때는 世祖 12년 丁亥夏 5월이엇다. 施愛는 이에 또 聲言하되 孝文이 咸興觀察 申㴐과 及 其父 叔舟와 반역을 謀하야 민심을 동요케 함으로 誅殺하얏다 하고 다시 一方으로 그 黨을 보내여 朝廷에 上書하되 각 營 人民이 外道兵에게 殺戮을 당할가 恐惶하야 訛言을 서로 傳한즉 本道의 인물로 道內 각 郡 守令을 삼어 인심을 안정케 하지 안으면 안이되겟다 하니 조정에서도 그 眞假를 알지 못하야 會寧軍官 成以乾에게 李施愛의 행동 여하를 물엇스나 成以乾이 또한 施愛의 술책에 속힌 바 되야 極力으로 李施愛의 忠國爲民한다는 事를 말하니 조정은 그저 半信半疑하엿슬 뿐이엿다.

一夜間에 十餘郡征服

施愛는 이와가티 상하의 인심을 현혹케 한 후 또 각 郡에 黨與를 파송하야 流言하되 咸鏡道內郡守觀察을 外道人이 가지고 잇스면 管內의 인민이 未久에 그들의 손에 滅殺을 당할 터이니 급속히 下手치 안으면 아니된다 하니 咸興 이북의 10여 郡이 一夜間에 그곳의 수령을 다 죽이고 호응하얏다.
이에 施愛는 스사로 施吉道節度使라 칭하고 各郡의 軍馬를 친히 지휘하야 吉州에다 大本營을 두고 破竹의 勢로 南進하야 端川을 점령하고 利城(今 利原)에 至하야는 縣監을 죽이고 其妻를 納入하야 妾을 삼고 連하야 北靑 洪原 等의 沿海 諸郡을 점령하니 咸興에 잇는 施愛의 徒黨이 또한 주민을 煽動하야 觀察使 申㴐를 包圍襲殺하고 繼하야 宣諭使 孫旭까지 斬殺하니 關北 일대가 불과 몃 칠 둥안에 全然 李施愛의 천하가 되엿섯다. 이와가티 불시에 성공을 한 施愛는 다시 자기의 地盤을 더욱 튼튼하히기 위하야 각 郡의 수령을 자기의 心腹人으로 뽑아 식히고 지방으로 순회하며 인민을 按撫하고 창고를 열어서 빈민을 구휼하며 옥문을 개방하야 죄인을 해방하고 또 도처에 聲言하되 당시 朝野에 信望이 多大한 韓明澮, 申叔舟, 權擥, 盧思愼, 韓繼禧 등이 * *** ** *** 京城을 칼날에 피칠도 안이하고 점령한다 하니 인민이 다 信聽하고 李節度의 만세를 歡呼하엿섯다.
그때까지도 조정에서는 施愛의 反狀을 잘 알지 못함으로 그다지 중시치 안이하더니 邊報가 날로 급하며 또 韓明澮, 申叔舟 이하의 중요 諸臣이 다 內應이 되엇다는 流言이 都下에 성행하니 世祖가 크게 놀나고 또 怒하야 먼저 韓明澮
申叔舟 등<4> 10여 중신을 궐내에 拘置하고 그 子婿는 다 禁府에 拿囚한 후(此等人은 其後 誣言이 판명되야 석방됨) 龜城君 浚을 命하야 都摠使를 삼그 戶曹判書 曹錫文으로 副摠使를 삼으며 忌服 중에 잇는 許悰을 親召하야 咸吉道節度使를 삼고 康純, 魚有沼, 南怡 등을 뽑아 大將을 삼으며 六道兵 3만을 징발하야 咸興에서 會케 하고 康純
南怡 등 28인을 다 錫文에 隷하야 즉시 永興에 赴케 하니 이와가티 六道의 大兵을 일시에 動함은 李朝 건국 후 처음의 일이요 文武의 名人名將 20여 인이 동시 출정하게 된 것도 李朝內亂史 중 듬은 일이엿다.

最後 一刻에 蔓嶺大激戰

그러나 都摠使 李浚은 아즉 18세의 청년으로 京城을 發한지 5일에 僅히 鐵原에 至하야 但히 路險하다는 핑계를 하고 罪를 江原監司의 治道 잘못한 데 돌녀 보내서 監司만 죽이고 時日을 遷延하며 (15일만에 淮陽에 至한즉 벌서 平亂하얏다는 報가 와서 도로 회군하얏는대 外面은 李浚의 遷延이나 사실은 당시 국내가 공허하고 兩南에 訛言이 또 유행함으로 世祖가 遷延하도록 密戒함이다) 端川 사람 崔潤孫은 조정의 內命을 밧고 施愛를 曉諭하러갓다가 反히 施愛에게 附化하야 조정의 기밀을 다 말하니 여러 가지가 官軍에 불리할 뿐 안이라 李施愛 삼 형제는 武勇이 원래 著名한 중 인민이 流言에 浮動하야 모도 施愛에게 附和함으로 츠음에 官軍는 감히 먼저 兵火를 交치 못하고 節度使 許悰과 體察使 尹子雲과 觀察使 魚世恭은 全혀 인심 안정과 회유책에 전력하얏섯다. 그러나 李施愛는 一切 官軍의 회유를 거절하고 더욱 병력을 집중하야 제1회로 洪原에서 크게 싸웟섯는대 李軍은 항상 夜襲을 하야 官軍을 크게 困케 하고 其次에는 北靑에서 또 크게 싸워 兩軍의 희생이 심히 만헛스나 승부가 別無하더니 제3차 蔓嶺의 싸홈에 李施愛의 軍이 大敗하얏스니 이 蔓嶺의 싸홈은 이번 반란 중 兩軍의 최대 격전이오 李軍의 一敗는 곳 그네의 치명상이 되엿섯다.
처음에 李施愛는 蔓嶺의 險高한 지점을 據하야 관군을 下攻하니 矢石이 빗발가티 쏘다나려서 관군의 死者가 10의 8, 9에 달하야 감히 仰攻치를 못하더니 許悰이 魚有沼로 하야금 감안이 精兵 수천을 배에 실고 海路로 도라서 蔓嶺의 上峯을 점거하되 軍兵의 服色을 초목의 빗과 가티 다 푸르게 하고 개암이(蟻)와 다람쥐 모양으로 나무를 안고 돌을 의지하야 불시에 북을 치며 李軍을 나려치니 李軍이 크게 놀나 軍伍를 일코 嶺下의 관군이 또한 상응하야 상하로 來攻하며 관군의 선봉장 李從生은 또한 용기를 내어 크게 奮戰하니 李軍이 능히 抵敵치 못하고 敗走하얏다. 그러나 그때까지 反軍은 아즉 軍勢가 심히 성함으로 관군이 감히 추격치 못하얏다.
그런데 여긔에 잠깐 소개할 일은 民間義兵將 延川君 車云革의 일이니 그는 麗末忠信文節 車原頫의 侄로 革朝의 初에 會寧에 謫居하얏는대 때마츰 施愛의 亂이 이러남으로 富寧人 曹紏, 鍾城人 鄭休明, 鍾城人 朴成章과 同謀하고 勤王의 兵을 이르키니, 世祖가 그를 嘉尙이 생각하고 특히 선봉장을<5> 拜하니 그는 75세의 노령으로 奪身出戰하야 李軍의 南進하는 摩雲嶺路을 단절하고 또 施伯, 施合 兩 형제를 誘執하야 관군에 보내더니 중도에서 副將 崔潤孫이 李施愛와 情을 통하야 施伯 형제를 奪送하고 反히 云革의 一同을 執하야 端川 獄中에 囚하니 그들은 그만 옥에서 節死하얏다. 그러나 李軍은 그로 인하야 일대 타격을 바더서 급속히 남진치 못하고 관군은 또 그 새이에 모든 요지를 점령하야 군사상 큰 편리를 엇게 되엿섯다.

千古遺恨鬼門關

施愛는 이와가티 蔓嶺에서 관군에게 대패를 당하얏스나 潑*한 壯氣는 조금도 屈橈치 안이하야 관군이 屢次 歸降을 권유하되 斷然히 거절하고 兵을 退하야 吉州의 本營을 굿게 직히고 재차 관군의 逆擊할 일을 계획하얏섯다. 그러나 때는 벌서 관군의 세력이 크게 되고 變幻이 無常한 민중은 관군의 세력이 커짐에 따러서 점차 施愛를 離叛코자 하는 경향이 뵈이니 施愛는 그 대세의 불리 할 것을 미리 짐작하고 虜中으로 건너가서 捲土重來하기를 결심한 후 妓生財寶를 다 실고 兵을 移하야 鏡城으로 가니 그때까지도 麾下는 施愛의 反狀을 알지 못하고 다만 관군이 咸鏡道人을 살해하러오는데 施愛는 그것을 반항하는 줄로만 알엇섯다.
그때에 마츰 吉州 사람 許惟禮가 施愛의 陣中에 와서 歸化를 청하니 惟禮는 원래 李施愛의 처남으로서 서울에 가서 司甕院別座로 잇다가 이제 施愛의 亂이 이러나매 彼는 그 기회에 한 功을 이를가 하고 世祖에게 자진하야 李施愛의 圖謀할 事를 請하고 표면으로 귀화함이엿다. 그러나 施愛와 許는 본시 故鄕인 동시에 처남이 되고 또 그의 부모까지도 施愛의 陣中에 잇스니 엇지 추호이나 其者가 異志가 잇슬 줄을 뜻하얏스랴. 그러나 언제이나 禍는 원래 蕭牆에 잇는 법이라. 惟禮는 施愛가 자기를 의심치 안이함을 무엇보다도 깃겁게 생각하고 暗暗 중에 施愛의 주요 부하인 李雲露(後錄 2等勳, 鍾城郡 莊敬公) 李珠, 黃生 등을 이해로 說諭하야 회심케 하고 다시 그 자들과 공모하야 鬼門關 밧게 큰 연회를 배설하고 施愛를 청하니 施愛가 방심하고 와서 놀다가 술이 半酣에 이르매 惟禮 등은 미리 약속하얏던 끈을 끈으니 施愛의 형제 及 일당이 맛치 주머니 속에 들은 쥐와 가티 속수무책으로 다 잽피워서 관군에게 호송되니 一世의 호걸인 李施愛도 遂히 鬼門關外의 斷頭鬼가 되고 말며 咸吉道는 그 까닭으로 南北道에 분리되고 吉州는 吉城縣으로 降下되며 龜城君 41人은 다 敵愾功臣의 錄을 타고 許惟禮도 또한 그 功으로 2等勳, 吉城君을 封하엿섯다.

이 李施愛의 실패는 여러 가지의 원인이 잇지만은 그중 한가지 특히 女色이니 그가 利原에서 縣監의 妻로 妾을 삼은 것은 신망을 크게 일을 뿐 안이라 거긔에 관련하야 屢日을 留連하는 동안에 남진할 시기를 일코 虜中으로 가랴 할 때에도 속히 심복 군병만 다리고 강을 건넷스면 鬼門關의 실패가 업섯겟는데 吉州에서 妓女財貨를 移送하노라고 시기를 일어 몸까지 죽고 말엇스니 후일에 큰 일을 하는 자 - 엇지 色을 愼치 안이하랴. <6>
