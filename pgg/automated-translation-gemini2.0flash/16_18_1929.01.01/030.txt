People Born in Gisasa and People Who Died in Gisasa, A Biographical History
						Kwon Deok-gyu

1. People Born in the Year of Gisa

Yun Jeung, the Leading Figure in the Hwaini Controversy

When examining the figures born in the Year of Gisa throughout history, the first person that comes to mind is Myeongjae Yun Jeung, who stirred up the great controversy between Song Uiam and Hwaeni during the reign of Sukjong. He was born in the Year of Gisa, the 7th year of Injo, and his courtesy name was Jain; he was the son of Yun Seon-geo of Micheon. He studied under Yu Gye of Sinam when he was young, and later served Song Si-yeol, Uiam, as his teacher. His father, Seon-geo, originally vehemently advocated rejecting peace (斥和) when the Qing envoy came in the Year of Byeongja, the 14th year of Injo, and requested that the barbarian envoy be beheaded. He temporarily became known as a man of integrity, and his reputation was widespread in the court and among the people. However, the following year, in the Year of Jeongchuk, when Ganghwa Island fell, his friends and his wife, Lady Yi, all died for their integrity, but he disregarded this and survived by surrendering, which caused the general public to despise him. He was also ashamed of his loss of integrity and did not return to court, instead retiring to Geumsan to enjoy the pleasures of nature with Yu Gye of Sinam. He also frequented the house of Sindeokjae Kim Jip, pursuing studies with Song Si-yeol and other great Confucian scholars of the Westerners faction. However, on the other hand, he was also on good terms with Yun Baek-ho Jeon, a Southerner who was a major enemy of Song Uiam due to differences in their factions, academic theories, and etiquette. Uiam strongly advised him to cease this exchange, and although Yun outwardly agreed, he secretly continued to associate with him. Uiam disliked Seon-geo and did not think much of his son, Jeung. Later, when Seon-geo died, Jeung conveyed his father's will (a will recommending the appointment of Southerners Heo Muk and Yun Jeon to the court) to Uiam and requested a tombstone inscription for his father. Uiam hated Seon-geo even more and wrote the inscription, "Promised to die with a friend, but the friend did not die; promised to die with his wife, but the wife died and he did not die. Ask about the events of Ganghwa Island in Ganghwa, etc..." clearly stating his father's involvement in the Ganghwa incident. <16> Jeung was greatly angered and severed his relationship with Uiam as a teacher and disciple, finally aligning himself with the Southerners. This was undoubtedly a mistake on Song Si-yeol's part. Later, in the spring of the Year of Gyehae, the 9th year of Sukjong, Si-yeol submitted a memorial regarding the issue of designating Hyojong's shrine and the posthumous title of Taejo (these two issues will be discussed in the Song Si-yeol article below). At that time, Park Se-chae, the Minister of Personnel and a member of the younger generation of the Westerners faction (a debate between the older and younger generations had already begun), was the first to oppose him. Yun Jeung, as Left Censor-General, also joined in, causing a major controversy with Song Si-yeol. This is the so-called Hwaini Controversy (Song resided in Hwadeok, and Yun resided in Nisan, i.e., Noseong, hence the name Hwaini). He was appointed Right State Councillor at the advanced age of 81 in the Year of Eulchuk, Sukjong, and his posthumous title was Munseong.

Park Se-dang, Author of the "Sabyunrok"

Among those born in the Year of Gisa, the 7th year of Injo, there is another notable figure: Park Se-dang, the biological father of Park Tae-bo. His pen name was Seogye, his courtesy name was Gyegon, and his posthumous title was Munjeong. In the Year of Gyeongja, Hyeonjong, he passed the civil service examination as a student and rose to the position of Vice-Minister of the Privy Council, entering the Council of Elder Statesmen. He was known for his integrity and often retreated from court to enjoy the pleasures of nature. He was also a prolific writer, and his book "Sabyunrok" (思辨錄) , which inherited the remnants of Yun Baek-ho Jeon's arguments, exclusively criticized Zhu Xi's interpretations of the Confucian classics and altered the chapters and sentences of the Doctrine of the Mean. The narrow-minded literati of the time, who were like slaves to Zhu Xi's doctrines and dared not voice dissenting opinions, and Song Uiam, who even submitted a memorial denouncing Yun Baek-ho's revision of the classics as a traitor to the school, led Sukjong to confiscate the "Sabyunrok," read it once, and then throw it into the fire and banish him to a remote area. Shim No-chung of Hyota, who lived in his old house, wrote a poem: "Teaching his son to be an assistant to the Confucian Way, resigning from office to become Qian Dancheng. In the end, knowing that the master of Bailudong is better than the student of Yichuan. The heterodoxy of Jinling is a transformation of a scholar, and the annotated new interpretations of Zhuang Yu's legacy. There is no need to discuss the Sabyunrok further; he is a scholar of his own accord." People praised his conduct through this poem.

Kim Su-hang, the Great Leader of the Westerners

Mungok Kim Su-hang was the grandson of Cheong-eum Kim Sang-heon and was also born in the Year of Gisa, the 7th year of Yi Dynasty. He died in the Year of Gisa, the 15th year of Sukjong, so it seems he had a special connection with the Year of Gisa. He studied at home from a young age, paying particular attention to the Gyeongsin chapter of the Elementary Learning, always sitting upright and never sitting casually. At the age of 18, he placed first in the licentiate examination, at 23 he passed the civil service examination, at 34 he became the Minister of Personnel, and at 44 he rose to the position of Chief State Councillor, his fame shaking the world. Hyeonjong trusted him greatly, treating him with extreme care during times of wise governance, and Sukjong also treated him with great respect at the beginning of his reign. When Song Si-yeol and the Southerner Yun Jeon had their first etiquette dispute (over the mourning attire for Queen Jangnyeol), he, as Royal Secretary, sided with Song and accused Goesan Yun Seon-do, a member of Yun's faction, leading to his exile to Samsu Prefecture. Later, in the second etiquette dispute (over the mourning attire for the Queen Consort in the 15th year of Hyeonjong), the Westerners faction failed, and Song Si-yeol and his brother Kim Su-heung were exiled, and he was also exiled to Yeongam. However, during the Gyeongsin Persecution, when the Westerners faction regained power, he returned to court and held important positions, with the Westerners all revering him as their leader. However, 10 years later, in the Year of Gisa, the 15th year of Sukjong, Song Si-yeol angered Sukjong by advocating for the designation of the Crown Prince, and the Southerners <17> impeached him, leading to Song Si-yeol's death in exile. He was also implicated and exiled to Jindo, where he died in exile.

2. People Who Died in the Year of Gisa

Yun Eon-yi, Literary Official of the Goryeo Dynasty

Among the people who died in the Year of Gisa, the most famous one would be Naehae Wang's Crown Prince Seok U-ro, who died at the hands of Japanese pirates in the Year of Gisa, the third year of King Jeomhae of Silla. However, since his story was briefly introduced in the 別貢 Gisa memoir, I will omit it here and begin with Jeongdang Literary Official Yun Eon-yi, who passed away in the Year of Gisa, the third year of King Uijong of Goryeo. He was the fourth son of Goryeo's Pyongjangsa Yun Choe. He was skilled in writing from a young age and passed the civil service examination early. He was deeply knowledgeable about the principles of the I Ching and wrote the 『易解』, which was passed down to later generations. He was close in understanding with Scholar Jeong Ji-sang and had a strained relationship with Kim Bu-sik. When Jeong Ji-sang was punished to death as an accomplice in Myocheong's rebellion, Yun was also implicated and demoted to Yangju Defense Officer. (Initially, Yun Eon-yi's father, Yun Choe, wrote the epitaph for Daegakguksa by royal order, but his disciples were dissatisfied and had Kim Bu-sik rewrite it. Yun disliked Kim because of this. Later, when Kim lectured on the I Ching before the king at the National Academy, Yun severely challenged him, and Kim could not respond, sweating profusely. From then on, Kim hated Yun and took this opportunity to punish him.)
In his later years, he loved Buddhism and retired to Paju, calling himself the Geumgang Layman, and always rode an ox when traveling. He became friends with the monk Gwanseung in the empty gate. Gwanseung built a hermitage (蒲菴) that could only accommodate one person, promising that the first of the two to die would be cremated in that spot. One day, Yun rode his ox to say goodbye to Gwanseung and returned, so Gwanseung had someone carry the hermitage. Yun smiled and said, "Gwanseung has not broken the promise," and took a brush to write on the wall: "Spring returns, autumn comes, flowers bloom, leaves fall. East returns, west comes, well nourish the true sovereign. Today, on the way, reflecting on this body, a piece of idle cloud in the vast sky." After finishing the writing, he passed away sitting in the hermitage. The king withdrew the court for three days and gave him the posthumous title of Munkang.

Commander Jang Man, Grand Commander

If we mention Grand Commander Jang Man, the protagonist of the nursery rhyme "The discontent is Jang Man" during the Yi Gwal Rebellion in the reign of Injo, there would be few who do not know him to this day. He also passed away in the Year of Gisa (the 7th year of Injo). He was from the Indong Jang clan, his courtesy name was Hogo, and his pen name was Nakseo. Although he had only one eye, he had extraordinary strength and skill in archery and horsemanship from a young age, so people called him the One-Eyed General. In his youth, he followed his father to Okcheon County, where he accidentally obtained the phrase "Wander in the realm of writing and ink, gallop in the midst of weapons and warfare" in a dream. Later, he indeed made a name for himself in both literary and military fields. In the Year of Gyehae, Injo, he was appointed Grand Commander, and the king personally bestowed a royal sword and conferred the title of Prince of Oksan. He made another great contribution at Anhyeon during the Gapja Rebellion, <18> suppressing the rebellion and being awarded the title of Distinguished Military Merit Subject.

Song Si-yeol, the Founder of Mandongmyo Shrine

When investigating the death records of the Year of Gisa, we cannot omit Song Si-yeol, the saint of Zun Zhou ideology and the founder of the Mandongmyo Shrine, also known as Zhu Xi of Joseon, Uiam. He was from the Eunjin Song clan, the eighth-generation descendant of Ssangcheongdang Yu. His father, Gap-jo, dreamed of Confucius and named him Seong-loe as a childhood name, then changed it to Yeong-bo. As a disciple of Sagye Kim Jang-saeng, he became a master of Confucianism, placing first in the licentiate examination in the Year of Gyeyu, Injo, and accompanying the king to Namhan Fortress in the Year of Byeongja. After the Ganghwa treaty, he returned to his hometown to study. At the beginning of Hyojong's reign, he was summoned as Royal Secretary and joined hands with Cheong-eum Kim Sang-heon, Sindeokjae Kim Jip, and Dongchun Song Jun-gil, who were in the court at the time, advocating for the famous Northern Expedition plan. However, when the plan was leaked and a strong protest from the Qing court arrived, he temporarily retreated from court. In the Year of Jeongyu, the king secretly summoned him again, and in the Year of Musul, he entered the court as a ritual attendee, receiving great favor and again discussing the Northern Expedition. However, soon after, Hyojong passed away, and all plans failed. Later, at the beginning of Hyeonjong's reign, while serving as Minister of Personnel, he engaged in a great debate (the Great Debate between the Southwesterners) with the Southerner Yun Hyu and his faction regarding the mourning attire for Queen Jangnyeol (Queen Jo, the second queen of Injo), eventually ousting the Southerners (Song advocated for the one-year mourning period, while Yun advocated for the three-year mourning period, and Yun's faction failed), gaining power and rising to the high position of Second State Councillor. Later, in the fifteenth year of Hyeonjong, during the mourning period for Queen Dowager Inseon (Queen Jang, the wife of Hyojong), he again advocated for the Daegong theory (nine months), engaging in the second etiquette dispute with the Southerners (the Southerners advocated for the one-year mourning period), resulting in failure. He was exiled to Deogwon, Hamgyeong Province, and then transferred to Heungcheon and Jangheung. In the sixth year of Sukjong, Gyeongsin, Heo Jeok, the Chief State Councillor, and his son Heo Gyeon were executed for treason, and at the same time, the leaders of the Southerners, including Yun Hyu and others, died as accomplices. The Westerners faction regained power, and he was summoned back to court, receiving great acclaim for a time. However, in this Gyeongsin Persecution, the elders of Si-yeol's faction treated the Southerners too harshly, causing the younger generation of their faction, Jo Chi-geom and Han Tae-dong, to raise objections, leading to conflict between the two sides. This was the beginning of the division between the Old and New Factions. Nevertheless, in the spring of the ninth year of Sukjong, Uiam submitted a memorial requesting that Hyojong's tomb be honored as a Royal Shrine (a shrine for enshrining ancestral tablets for eternal worship) and proposing that, as the year marked nearly three hundred years (i.e., two hundred and ninety-six years) since Yi Taejo's retreat from Wihwa Island, the posthumous title of "Soyi Jeongyun" be conferred upon Taejo (this was because Taejo's achievements were not clear, which is the true color of a fake Ming scholar). Park Se-chae and Yun Jeung (see the Yun Jeung article above for the relationship between Song and Yun) of the New Faction strongly opposed, causing a great dispute in the court and among the people. Afterwards, in the fifteenth year of Sukjong, the Year of Gisa, Sukjong designated Gyeongjong as Crown Prince, and Si-yeol opposed this by submitting a memorial. Lee Hyeon-gi, Nam Chi-hun, and Yun Bin, his original political enemies from the Southerner faction, were enraged by Song's actions and appealed to Sukjong, leading the king to become greatly angered. Song was stripped of his official titles and exiled to Jeju Island, then re-exiled to Jeongeup, where he was given poison, dying at the age of eighty-three.

Park Tae-bo, Unyielding Even Under Torture

"Park Tae-bo lived even after being subjected to 断筋 (dangeun) torture" is a saying commonly heard even among women in the streets. The protagonist of this story, Park Jeong-jae Tae-bo, was the son of Seogye Park Se-dang and was adopted by Park Se-hu. He became Royal Secretary after placing first in the licentiate examination in the Year of Eulmyo, Sukjong, but was dismissed from office due to his frequent outspokenness and retired to his home. In the Year of Gisa, the fifteenth year of Sukjong, when the king deposed Queen Min and elevated Lady Jang Hui-bin to the position of queen, he, along with Oh Du-in, Lee Se-hwa, and others, submitted a memorial opposing it. Because the memorial was extremely heartfelt and passionate, the king was greatly angered and personally presided over the interrogation at Injeongmun, beginning with caning, knee-pressing torture (a torture that involves placing boards above and below the knees and pressing down), and branding torture (a torture that involves burning with fire), inflicting all kinds of cruel torture. His complexion did not change even as his flesh was torn from his body, and he remained steadfast in his outspokenness. The king could not do anything and exiled him to Jindo. He died of poisoning at Boryangjin. The cruelty of the torture at that time was the most severe of any royal interrogation in Joseon's history, and there has never been anyone in history who has suffered such cruel torture while maintaining an unchanging demeanor and speaking frankly and vehemently. At that time, he was only thirty-six years old.

Oh Du-in, Who Died Unyielding

Oh Du-in, whose courtesy name was Wonjeung and pen name was Sagok, was the son of Oh Eon, who was executed at the same time as Park Tae-bo for submitting a memorial opposing the deposition of the queen. When he was only ten years old, the Ming envoy Cheng Long saw him and was greatly impressed, asking him to create a rhyme and write a poem. Du-in took up his brush and wrote it immediately, causing Cheng to be greatly surprised and praising him as a great figure whose future was unpredictable. He placed first in the licentiate examination in the Year of Muja, Injo, and rose to the position of Minister of Punishments. When Sukjong deposed Queen Min in the Year of Gisa, Du-in shed tears upon hearing this, saying, "I have received the grace of four reigns and reached the position of Minister. Seeing that the state affairs have come to this, I would rather be dismissed for my crimes than remain silent," and he submitted a memorial with Lee Se-hwa, Park Tae-bo, and others. Despite it being the second watch of the night, the king personally appeared at Injeongmun to conduct the court interrogation. The officials were greatly horrified because they did not have time to prepare the necessary supplies. Du-in and Se-hwa were arrested first, and Tae-bo entered in succession. There was no one who watched without losing their color. The Grand Censor-General Yuk Chang-myeong impeached them. Du-in was tortured almost to death but did not yield. The severity of the torture was reduced, and he was exiled to Uiju, but he died on the way. (Posthumous title: Chungjeong)

Min Jeong-jung, Who Served as Chief State Councillor Twice

Old Peak Min Jeong-jung was the son of Inspector Min Gwang-hun. He passed the licentiate examination in the Year of Muja, Injo, and placed first in the civil service examination in the Year of Eulchuk, becoming Grand Secretary. Prior to this, Crown Princess Sohyeon's wife, Lady Kang, had been executed for her crimes, and her children were exiled to the islands. The people of the country all felt pity for them, but no one dared to speak out. Jeong-jung alone submitted a memorial requesting her exoneration, causing the king and his ministers to worry about Min's personal safety, fearing they would be punished. The king, knowing his loyalty, set it aside without action. At that time, the Qing court sent an envoy to reprimand the court because of the incident. Jeong-jung submitted a memorial, saying, "The humiliation of the country is extreme, and this subject is filled with anger and wishes to die. It is truly appropriate to open up intelligence and first inspire a spirit of action to encourage integrity and not allow our lord to be troubled by the worries of others." The king read his memorial and said, "He makes a man's spirit soar like a mountain." When he was serving as Grand Censor, the governor of Honam reported that there was a Buddha statue that was sweating. Jeong-jung destroyed it, eradicating the deceptive rumors. When he was serving as Grand Scholar, he had the lecture halls of the university repaired with the materials and tiles from two nunneries. These are the current Seokcheondang, Illyang, and Pirip halls. In the Year of Gyeongsin, he was promoted from Right State Councillor to Chief State Councillor. In the Year of Gapin, the Southerners Heo Jeok and Yun Hyu came to power and exiled the Westerner Song Si-yeol, and Jeong-jung was also implicated and stripped of his official position. In the Year of Gimmi, he was exiled to Jangheung. The following year, in the Year of Gyeongsin, with the treason of Heo Gyeon, the Southerners Yun Hyu, Heo Jeok, and others were wiped out, and the Westerners regained power. Jeong-jung was summoned back from exile and paid his respects to the king. Later, when the queen was deposed, the Southerners again came to power. As he was Queen Min's uncle and a leader of the Westerners, he was again exiled to Byeokdong County, where he died from a chronic wind-induced paralysis in exile.

Kim Ik-hun, the Accuser of Two Great Unjust Trials

The Gyeongsin Persecution of the sixth year of Sukjong is a major persecution that everyone remembers with dread. Not only were Heo Gyeon, the illegitimate son of Chief State Councillor Heo Jeok, the alleged mastermind of the treason, and the three brothers of the royal family, Prince Bokchang Jeong, Prince Bokseon Nam, and Prince Bokpyeong *, sons of Grand Prince Inpyeong Jun (the third son of Injo), all executed, but also Heo Gyeon's father Heo Jeok and Yun Hyu, Ryu Hyeok-ran, Oh Ting-chang, Choi Man-sul, and others all died unjustly, and the entire Southerner faction suffered a major blow. On the surface, it may seem that the Southerners were involved in treason, but in reality, the Westerner faction plotted this unjust trial to seize power from the Southerners and restore their own power. The masterminds behind this plot were Lord Cheongseong Kim Seok-ju and Kim Ik-hun, the Lord Gwangnam, who I want to talk about here. He was the grandson of Sagye Kim Jang-saeng, and in the Year of Muja, Hyeonjong, he was appointed to the position of Dosa through a hereditary appointment, eventually being promoted to Commander of the Royal Guards. However, Chief State Councillor Heo Jeok dismissed him, arguing that he was related to the queen's family. In the Gyeongsin Persecution, he was ennobled as Lord Gwangnam for his service in reporting the treason and appointed Minister of Punishments and Commander-in-Chief. After the Gyeongsin Persecution, he instigated Kim Hwan to accuse the Southerners Heo Seok, Heo Yeong, and Ryu Myeong-gyeon of treason, eventually creating a false accusation. Jo Chi-geom and Han Tae-dong, members of the younger generation of the Westerner faction, impeached him, requesting that he be punished for his crimes. Song Si-yeol fiercely defended Kim because he was the grandson of his teacher Jang-saeng, leading to a conflict between the Old and New Factions. Later, during the Sukjong Year of Gisa Change of Administration, the censors Jeong Bak and others could not do anything about Ik-hun, and he eventually died in prison. The Royal Secretary Kwon Hwan reported that his body was displayed at the prison gate for several days. In conclusion, Ik-hun not only committed crimes against the Southerners but also committed many crimes against the state. It is no ordinary matter that he could not escape the persecution in this Year of Gisa. <21>

己巳生과 己巳死, 歷代人物列傳
						權悳奎
1.己巳年에 出生한 人物

懷尼爭論의 主動人物 尹拯

歷代 己巳中에 나흔 인물을 考査할 때에 제일 먼저 생각나는 이는 肅宗屍臺에 宋尤菴과 繪尼의 大爭論을 이르키던 明齋 尹拯이다. 그는 仁祖 7年 己巳生으로 字는 子仁이니 美村 尹宣擧의 아들이다. 어렷슬때에 市南 兪棨에게 受學하다가 長成한 뒤에 宋尤菴 時烈을 師事하엿는데 그 父 宣擧는 元來 仁祖 14年 丙子에 淸使가 來하엿슬때에 極力으로 斥和를 主唱하야 虜使의 斬하기를 請한 일로 一時名節의 士로 朝野에 名聲이 琤琤하더니 그 翌年 丁丑에 江都가 陷落될 때에 그의 知友와 妻 李氏가 다 節死함에 不拘하고 屈節逃生함으로 일반이 卑視하니 그도 또한 자기의 失節한 것을 붓그러워하야 다시 朝路에 나가지 안코 錦山에 退歸하야 市南 兪棨와 가티 山水의 樂을 하며 또 愼獨齋 金集의 門에 出入하야 宋時烈外 其他西人의 巨儒와 追逐하엿다. 그러나 一方으로는 또 當時 宋尤菴과 色派, 學說禮論이 모도 달너 一大仇敵이 된 南人 尹白湖鐫와 서로 조와함으로 尤菴이 極力으로 그 交流함을 勸止하니 尹이 表面으로는 그것을 承諾하엿스나 內面에는 의연히 交遊하니 尤菴이 宣擧를 疾視하는 동시에 其子 拯까지 그리 神通하게 녁이지 안엇섯다. 그러다가 宣擧가 死함에 拯이 그 父의 遺書(南人 許穆과 尹鐫를 朝廷에 薦用하라는 遺書)를 尤菴에게 傳하고 또 其父의 墓碑文을 請하엿더니 尤菴은 더욱 宣擧를 미워하야 碑文을 짓되 「與友約死而友死不死하고 與妻約死而妻死不死하니 江都之事는 問於江都云云...」하고 其夫의 江都의 累를 明言하니<16> 拯이 크게 怒하야 이에 尤菴과 師弟의 誼를 絶하고 遂히 南人과 氣脉을 相通하얏다. 이것은 勿論 宋時烈의 잘못한 處事엿다. 그러다가 肅宗 9年 癸亥 春에 時烈이 孝宗의 世室問題와 太祖의 徽號問題로 上疏하니(此二問題는 以下 宋時烈記事에 參照) 當時 西人中 少壯派(先是하야 老少爭論이 起함)인 吏判 朴世釆가 率先反對하매 尹拯이 左叅贊으로 또한 此에 附和하야 宋時烈과 一大爭論을 이르켯스니 이것은 所謂 老少의 懷尼爭論이다. (宋은 懷德에 居하고 尹은 尼山 卽 魯城에 居함으로 懷尼라 云함) 그는 肅宗 乙丑에 81歲의 高齡으로 右議政에 拜하얏스니 諡는 文成이다.

思辨錄 著者 朴世堂

仁祖 7年 己巳生中에 또한 著名한 이가 한 분 잇스니, 그는 朴泰輔의 生父 朴世堂이다. 號는 西溪, 字는 季肯이오, 諡는 文貞이니, 顯宗 庚子에 生員 文科로 官이 判中樞府事에 이르고 耆社에 入하얏다. 性이 介廉하야 일즉이 朝路에 退하고 山水에 娛樂하며 文章이 또한 可觀할 者가 多한 中, 所著 思辨錄은 尹白湖鐫의 餘論을 襲하야 專혀 朱子의 經書註說을 論功하고 中庸의 章句를 變動한 것이니 朱子學說에 一種奴隷가 되야 敢히 異論을 붓치지 못하는 當時 固陋한 士流는 맛치 宋尤菴이 尹白湖의 經傳改註에 對하야 斯門亂賊이라고 그 일로 上疏까지 하니 肅宗이 그 思辨錄을 沒入하야 한번 본 後, 火에 投하고 遠地에 竄하얏다. 孝田 沈魯崇이 그의 老宅에 지내다가 一詩를 題하되『敎子能爲孔道輔오 辭官仍作錢淡成이라 終知白鹿洞中主가 勝似伊川門下生이라 金陵曲學은 秀才變이오 莊臾遺文箋註新이라 不必更論思辨錄이니 自家要是讀書人이라』 云云하니 世人이 이 詩로써 그의 行狀이라 稱하얏다.

西人의 巨首 金壽恒

文谷 金壽恒은 淸陰 金尙憲의 孫으로 또한 李朝 7年 己巳에 出生하야 肅宗 15年 己巳에 死하얏스니 그와 己巳와는 무스 奇緣이 잇는 것 갓다. 그는 어려서부터 家庭에서 受學하얏는데 小學敬身篇에 가장 注意하야 항상 終日토록 危坐하고 조끔도 箕踞치 안엇섯다. 18世에 進士壯元을 하고 23에 文科, 34에 文衡吏判, 44에 領相에 이르니 顯名이 一世를 振하얏다. 顯宗은 그를 信任하야 賢命의 際에 極히 丁寧하고 肅宗初에도 역시 禮遇가 甚崇하더니 宋時烈과 南人 尹鐫 間에 第一回禮論싸홈을 할 때(莊烈王后服制로)에 그는 承旨로서 宋에 加擔하야 尹의 一派인 孤山 尹善道를 論罪하야 三水府에 流逐하더니 그후 第二回禮論싸홈에(玄宗 15年 王妃服制論)西人이 失敗하야 宋時烈과 其兄 金壽興이 流配되매 그도 또한 靈岩으로 流配되더니 庚申大獄時에 西人이 다시 勢力을 잡게 됨에 臨하야는 또한 入朝하야 重職에 잇게 되니, 西人이 모도 그를 領袖로 推崇하얏다. 그러다가 10年後 肅宗 15年 己巳에 宋時烈이 元子定號를 上하다가 肅宗에게 觸怒하고 南人이<17> 論劾하야 宋時烈이 竄死하니 그 亦 그 連坐로 珍島에 實하얏다가 謫所에서 죽엇다.

2. 기사년에 죽은 인물

高麗 政堂文學 尹彦㶊

이 기사년에 죽은 인물 중에 가장 저명한 이로 말하면 삼국시대=신라 沾解王 3년 기사에 왜구에게 죽은 奈解王太子 昔于老를 먼저 칠 것이다. 그러나 그에 관한 이약이는 別貢 己巳 회고록 중에 잠간 소개하얏기에 여귀에는 略하고 그 다음 고려 毅宗 3년 기사에 도라간 정당문학 尹彦㶊를 필두로 말하겟다. 그는 고려 平章事 尹璀의 第四子로 소시부터 문장에 능하야 일즉이 登科하고 易理를 깁히 통함으로 『易解』를 저술하야 후세에 전하얏다. 그는 학사 鄭知常과 교의가 갓찹고 金富軾과 間隙이 잇섯슴으로 妙京의 난에 鄭知常이 연좌로 罪死하매 또한 연좌되야 양주방어사로 貶하얏섯다(初의 彦㶊의 부 尹璀이 왕명으로 대각국사의 비문을 지엿섯는데 其 門徒가 불만하게 생각하고 金富軾으로 개작케 하엿더니 윤이 그로 인하야 김을 嫌하다가 其後 국자감에서 김이 어전에 주역을 강론할 때에 윤이 심히 論難하매 김이 能對치 못하야 안면에 땀이 흐르더니 그 후부터 김이 윤을 증오하야 이 기회에 貶罪하얏다)
만년에 불법을 조와 하야 파평에 퇴거하며 자호를 金剛居士라 하고 출입할 때이면 항상 소를 타고 다니엿다. 僧 貫乘으로 더부러 空門의 友를 삼엇섯는데 貫乘이 一 蒲菴을 짓되 다만 한사람이 容身하게 만지여서 두 사람 중 먼저 죽는 사람이 그 자리에서 坐化하기로 約하더니 一日은 윤이 소를 타고 貫乘에게 가서 고별하고 還하거늘 貫乘이 사람으로 하야금 蒲菴을 負送하니 윤이 笑하야 왈 貫乘이 約을 負치 안엇다 하고 筆을 취하야 벽에 書하야 왈 『春復秋兮여 花開葉落이로다. 東復西兮여 善養眞君이로다. 今日途中에 返觀此身하니 萬里長空에 一片閒雲이로다』하고 書를 필한 후 蒲菴에 坐逝하니 왕이 삼일간 撤朝하고 諡를 文康이라 하다.

眇目將軍 張晩 都元帥

인조조 李适亂 때에 『불만이 張晩이라』던 동요의 주인공인 도원수 張晩이라 하면 지금까지 별로 모를 사람이 업슬 것이다. 그도 역시 이 기사년에 작고한 이니 (인조 7년 기사) 그는 인동 장씨로 자는 好古오 호는 洛西다. 비록 한 눈이 깨긋하나 어려서부터 용력이 절륜하고 射御를 잘하야 사람들이 眇目 장군이라 칭하얏다. 소시에 그 아버지를 따러서 옥천군에 가섯는데 몽중에 우연이 『優遊乎翰墨之場하고 馳騁乎干戈之際라』는 문구를 어덧더니 뒤에 과연 문무 양방에 다 이름을 날리엿다. 인조 계해에 도원수를 배하매 상이 친히 尙方劒을 賜하고 玉山府院君을 봉하엿더니 갑자활란에 鞍峴에서 또 대공을 세워<18> 其 난을 平함으로 振武功臣으로 勳을 봉하얏다.

萬東廟의 장본인 宋時烈

기사년 冥府錄을 조사할 때에 또한 아 빼지 못할 인물은 尊周主義의 성자요 萬東廟의 장본인인 소위 해동 주자 尤庵 宋時烈이다. 그는 恩津 송씨로 雙淸堂愉의 八世孫이니 其父 甲祚가 일즉이 孔子를 꿈꾸고 나 헛승으로 小字를 聖賚라 하엿다가 다시 英甫로 곳치엿다. 沙溪 金長生의 문인으로 유학계 巨匠이 되야 인조 癸酉에 생원 장원을 하고 丙子에 南漢에 扈駕하엿다가 강화 후 향리에 가서 學을 修하더니 효종 즉위초에 掌令으로 召拜되야 당시 在朝한 淸陰 金尙憲, 愼獨齋 金集, 同春 宋浚吉 등과 악수하야 彼 유명한 북벌론을 주창하다가 事가 泄하야 淸廷의 外喝이 이르매 일시 退朝하더니 丁酉에 상이 다시 밀찰로 召하야 戊戌에는 禮參으로 入朝케 하고 극히 신입하야 또 북벌을 議하더니 未幾에 孝宗이 승하하매 事가 모도 실패에 도라갓다. 其後 顯宗 초에는 吏判에 在하야 莊烈王后(仁祖繼妃 趙氏) 복제에 관한 禮論으로 남인 尹鑴 일파와 대논쟁(西南人 大論爭)을 이르켜 결국 남인을 蹴破하고 (송은 朞年說을 주창하고 윤은 삼년설을 주창하다가 윤파가 실패함) 세를 得하야 일시 좌의정의 중직에 昇하엿더니 其後 顯宗 십오년에 仁祖大妃(孝宗妃 張氏)의 상에 임하야 그는 또 大功說(구개월)을 주창하야 남인과 제2차 예론대쟁(남인은 朞年說을 主함)을 하다가 실패의 결과 함남 德源에 竄逐하야 熊川, 長䰇 등지로 移配더엿더니 숙종 6년 庚申에 領相 許積의 子 許堅이 역모로 伏誅하고 許積 외 남인의 거수 尹鑴 등이 坐死하는 동시에 서인 일파가 다시 세력을 잡으니 그도 또한 召還 入朝하야 일시 大聲望을 어덧섯다. 그러나 이 庚申獄事에 時烈 일파가의 老成者가 남인을 너무 가혹하게 처치한 까닭으로 자파 즉 서인의 소장파 趙持謙
韓泰東 등이 반대론을 起하야 양방이 서로 角立하니 차즉 노소 분당의 시초다. 然而 숙종 9년에 春에 尤庵은 상소하야 효종의 묘를 世室(永代祭祀를 행하는 位牌를 納하는 神室)로 尊할 事를 청하고 且 其年은 이태조의 위화도 회군 근 삼백년(즉 이백구십육년)에 당한 고로 그 時를 際하야 태조에게 『昭義正倫』의 徽號를 추상하자고 제의(이것은 태조가 功明치 안은 것을 위함이니 此則 假明學者의 본색이다) 하얏다가 소론 중 吏參 朴世采와 尹拯(송과 윤의 관계는 상기 尹拯 기사에 참조) 이 극력 반대하야 조야의 대분쟁을 이르켯다. 그뒤 숙종 십오년 己巳에 至하야는 숙종이 경종을 세자로 대하매 시열이 차를 반대하야 상소하엿더니 본래의 정적인 남인파의 李玄紀, 南致薰, 尹彬 등이 송의 죄를 노하야 숙종에 상언하니 왕이 또한 대노하야 송의 관작을 삭탈하고 제주에 유배하얏다가 다시 井邑에 유배되야 그곳에서 賜死하니 時年 팔십삼세엿다.

斷筋刑에도 不屈한 朴泰輔

『朴泰輔가 斷筋질에도 살엇다』하는 말은 여항의 부녀들까지도 흔이 하는 말이다. 이약이의 주인공인 朴定齋 泰輔는 西溪 朴世堂의 아들로 朴世垕에게 出繼하엿다. 숙종 乙卯에 생원 문과 장원으로 應敎가 되엿더니 직언을 만히 하는 까닭으로 罷官이 되야 집에 退在하엿섯다. 숙종 십오년 기사에 왕이 閔妃를 폐하고 張禧嬪를 왕비로 봉하게 되매 그는 吳斗寅, 李世華 등과 더부러 반대의 상소를 하니 疏意가 극히 深切 激越함으로 왕이 진노하야 仁政門에 親臨하고 鞠問을 始하야 杖刑, 壓膝刑(膝의 상하에 판을 置하고 壓下하는 刑), 炮烙刑(불로 지지는 형) 등 가진 악형을 다하야 전신에 혈육이 剝爛되는 난색이 조곰도 변치 안코 의연이 직언하니 왕이 또한 엇지하지 못하고 진도로 유배한 바 *梁津에 이르러 형독으로 死하니 그때의 그 악형이야말로 조선 유사후 親鞫 중 최대 학형이오 또 고와 가티 악형을 당하면서도 辭色을 불변하고 철두철미하게 직언 극간한 인물도 역대에 其比가 無하엿다. 때의 그의 연령은 僅히 삼십육세의 장년이엿다.

死而不屈한 吳斗寅

朴泰輔와 동시에 폐비 반대 상소를 하다가 刑死한 吳斗寅의 字는 元徵이오 호는 賜谷이니 吳䎘의 子엿다. 나히 겨우 십세때에 明使 程龍이 보고 크게 이상히 녁여 韻을 내고 시를 지흐라 하니 두인이 붓을 잡고 즉시에 지흐니 정이 크게 놀내 갈오대 타일에 엇지 될지 모를 큰 인물이라고 하얏다. 인조 戊子에 진사 문과 장원으로 官이 刑曹判書에 이르럿더니 숙종 己巳에 閔妃를 폐하게 되매 두인이 듯고 눈물을 흘녀 갈오되 내가 四朝의 후은을 바더 位가 卿宰에 이른바 국사가 이에 이른 것을 보니 寧히 죄로 廢할지언정 엇지 一言이 업스리오 하고 遂히 李世華
朴泰輔 등으로 더부러 상소하니 夜가 二鼓가 됨에 불구하고 상이 仁政門에 御하야 廷鞫을 設하야 急命하니 有司가 공급할질을 좃차 없서서 크게 황공하엿섯다. 두인과 세화가 먼저 잡혀오고 태보가 차례로 繼하야 드러오니 보는 자가 失色치 안는 자 업섯다. 大司憲 陸昌明이 劾論하니 두인이 악형의 고문을 당하야 거의 죽게 되되 굴치 안엇섯다. 악형을 減하야 의주에 안치되더니 도중에 死하얏다. (謚 忠貞)

兩度入相한 閔鼎重

老峯 閔鼎重은 감사 光勳의 아들이다. 인조 戊子에 進士하고 乙丑에 문과 장원으로 大司諫이 되얏다. 이에 先하야 昭顯世子嬪 姜氏가 죄로 폐사하고 그 자녀는 海島로 流徙하니 국인이 다 불상이 녁이되 감히 말하는 자가 업더니 鼎重이 獨疏로 그의 伸寃을 청하니 군신이 다 죄를 어들가 하야 민의 신상을 염려하더니 상이 또한 그 忠을 알고 불문에 付하얏다. 때에 淸廷이 其 사건으로 使를 遣하야 조정을 책하니 鼎重이 소를 上하야 言하되 『辱國이 甚矣에 신이 憤痛欲死이노니 誠宜開張聰明하고 先奮有爲之志하야 以勵節義하고 無使吾君으로 徒受困於慮人爲也라』 운운하니 상이 그 疏를 읽으시고 갈오대 『사람으로 하야곰 氣가 산가티 솟게 한다』하시엿다. 대사헌으로 잇슬 때에 호남의 수령이 報하기를 그곳에 불상이 잇는데 땀이<20> 나는 일이 잇다 하엿더니 장중이 그것을 파쇄하야 妖言을 근절케 하고 또 大司成으로 잇슬 때에는 兩尼院의 材瓦로 大學齋舍를 修葺케 하엿스니 지금의 石闡堂, 一兩, 闢入 등 齋가 그것이다. 庚申에 右相으로 좌의정에 陞하엿더니 甲寅에 남인 許積, 尹鑴 등이 當局하야 서인 宋時烈을 竄逐하니 鼎重이 또한 연좌하야 削職되고 己未에는 長興에 유배되엿더니 其 翌年에 許堅의 역모로 尹鑴, 許積 등 남인파가 일망타진되고 서인이 다시 用權하게 되매 鼎重이 또한 謫中에서 入召되야 상에 拜하엿더니 그 뒤 폐비할 때에 남인이 또 用權하니 그는 閔妃의 백숙부요 서인의 거수인 까닭에 또한 碧潼郡으로 유배되엿다가 宿病인 風痹로 謫所에서 死하엿다.

兩大冤獄의 告發者 金益勳

숙종 육년 庚申의 옥사라 하면 누구나 무시무시하게 생각하는 큰 옥사이다. 소위 역모의 주괴수인 領相 許積의 서자 許堅과 종실 麟坪大君 濬(인조 第三子)의 福昌君 楨, 福善君 枏과 福平君 *의 삼형제가 다 誅戮됨은 물론이고 堅의 부 許積, 外 尹鑴, 柳赫然, 吳挺昌, 崔萬說 등이 모도 원통이 죽고 남인 전체가 일시 대화를 입엇섯다. 표면으로 보면 물론 남인이 역당에 참여한 까닭이라 하겟지만은 내면에는 소위 서인파가 남인의 세력을 뺏고 自家 세력을 회복하랴고 이 冤獄을 음모한 것이다. 이 음모의 주동자는 소위 淸城府院君 金錫胄와 여긔에 말하고자 하는 光南君 金益勳이다. 그는 沙溪 金長生의 손이나 현종 戊子에 蔭官으로 都事에 補하야 御營大將까지 超遷하엿더니 領相 許積이 椒房의 親이라 논하야 遞官되엿다 庚申獄事에 고발한 공으로 光南君을 봉하고 형조판서 겸 總戎使를 拜하며 庚申 후에는 다시 金煥을 사주하야 남인의 許璽, 許瑛, 柳命堅 등을 謀逆으로 고발하야 遂히 誣獄을 이르켯더니 서인 소장파 趙持謙, 韓泰東이 此를 論劾하야 罪科에 처하기를 청하니 宋時烈은 김이 그 師 長生의 孫인 까닭에 극히 斗護함으로 遂히 老少가 角立하게 되엿다. 其後 숙종 己巳換局 시에 諫官 鄭樸 등이 益勳도 如何치 못하고 竟히 옥중에서 죽은바 승지 權煥이 啓하고 獄門에서 수일동안 暴尸하얏다. 摠而言之하면 익훈은 남인에게만 죄악이 잇슬 뿐안이라 국가에 대한 죄악이 또한 만타. 이 己巳年에 옥사를 면치 못한 것도 그리 尋常한 일이 안이다.<21>
