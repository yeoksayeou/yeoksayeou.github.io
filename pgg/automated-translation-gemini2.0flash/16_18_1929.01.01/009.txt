Fourth Year, Byeolgeonkon New Year's Issue

The moon is bright on the 24th night, and the beautiful festival is the Jeongwol Sangwon (정월상원, the first full moon of the lunar new year). Countless people rejoice together in the streets, and noblemen also carry their staffs and joyfully step in their shoes. Watching lanterns and admiring flowers at all four seasons, and the year-end se時 (세시, seasonal customs) and offering sacrifices (伏臘, bokreup), it seems that all people are enjoying themselves today.

The flute crying in the dragon tower responds to the Taecheok (太簇) pitch, and the lights lit in every household greet the Sangwon moon. Suddenly, countless people rejoice on the hundred-foot Honggyo (虹橋, rainbow bridge).

Last year, on this night, I watched the moonlight; this year, again, the moon shines brightly. Now, I know that the years change and the months remain long.
Pak Hyo-gwan

White snow fills the universe, and a thousand mountains are jade. Plum blossoms are half-open, and bamboo leaves are green. Boy, fill the cup to the brim; I am overcome with spring fever.
Anonymous

The wind drives the snow and strikes against the mountain window; the cold air stealthily invades the sleeping plum blossoms. No matter how much you try to comfort them, how can you understand the spirit of spring?
