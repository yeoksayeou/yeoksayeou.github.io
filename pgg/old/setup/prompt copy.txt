Leave the first two columns of this text alone but translate this the list of article titles (and author and type in other columns) to English. The original is in colonial period Korean (or Japanese). Romanize any proper names/places you come across in McCune Reischauer (but Japanese names/places in Hepburn).  Output this as raw text, do not add any markdown or formatting. Preserve tabs. Do not add any comments or response before or after.
