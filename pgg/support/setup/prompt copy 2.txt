Process the provided Korean or Japanese language text document (expect 1930s-1940s Korean or Japanese language, including Kanji/Hanja, older spellings and word usage, and potentially Japanese/Korean names/places) according to the following detailed instructions and output the result as raw text only, omitting any introductory phrases like 'Okay, here is...':

1.  **Header Section:**
    * Extract and list the following metadata: Magazine Title, Publication Date, Article Title, Author, Article Type.
    * For the Magazine Title, use the original Hanja/Kanji characters if provided. Do not romanize it.
    * Provide a concise English translation or explanation in parentheses after the original Article Title and Article Type.

2.  **Body Text Translation:**
    * Provide a full English translation of the main text content from Korean to English or, if the article is in Japanese then from Japanese to English.
    * Any romanized names or places should be in McCune-Reischauer romanization for Korean and regular Hepburn romanization for Japanese.
    * If there are section headers, don't forget to translate them. You don't need to leave any full passages from the original.
    * Preserve the page numbers where they are located (e.g. <32> etc.) in the original.
    * Always offer blank lines between paragraphs to make these very clear. Sometimes the original just has single line breaks for new paragraphs, but always give two.
    * Pay attention to nuances of 1930-40s Korean or Japanese.
    * For rare or ambiguous terms (do this sparingly, and not for normal words found in everyday speech) or named entities you may add the original in parentheses immediately after the English translation of that term but don't romanize or convert to hangul/kana any hanja/kanji when doing so. Also don't change any existing hangul into hanja - just give whatever the original was. For Example: 'Is it a gold palanquin (金가마)? Ignore the superstitions of geomancy (風水).'

4.  **Named Entities Section:**
    * Create a section titled '**Named Entities**' with a blank line after it.
    * List only specific named people, places (e.g., Korea, Li Pa'in, Itō Hirobumi), or organizations (e.g. Government-General) identified in the text. Use McCune-Reischauer romanization in the case of Korean places and people, or Hepburn romanization for Japanese places or people.
    * **Exclude** the magazine title itself from this list.
    * Use the following **tab-separated** format for each entry:
        - first the Original Form (Hanja/Hangul/Kanji as it appeared) Hangul or Kana
        - then the English Translation or, if you are romanizing the name, McCune-Reischauer Romanization for Korean or Hepburn if romanizing Japanese (as appropriate, choose one, not both) 
    * Don't put '(McCune-Reischauer)' or '(Common Romanization)' etc. - just romanize without comment with McCune-Reischauer or Hepburn as appropriate for the language.

Ensure the final output is presented entirely as raw plaintext, without any markdown formatting or introductory conversational text.
