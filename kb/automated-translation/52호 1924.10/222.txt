**Summary**

This article is a company announcement from Gaebyeoksa, the publisher of Gaebyeok magazine. It lists the locations and responsible personnel (managers, general affairs staff, chiefs) for new branch offices and sales outlets established in September 1924 in various towns and districts, specifically Anju, Yonggang County, Kangso, and Yongamp'o. From a historical perspective, this notice is interesting as it details the expanding physical distribution network of a major Korean nationalist magazine during the Japanese colonial period. It shows Gaebyeoksa actively establishing a presence in different regions (which are now in North Korea), providing concrete data on its organizational structure and reach, which historians could use to gauge the magazine's influence and operational logistics under colonial rule.
