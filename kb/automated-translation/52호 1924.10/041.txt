To the Readers of Kaebyŏk / Call for Opinions on the Reform of Korean Clothing

The various inconveniences and disadvantages of traditional Korean clothing have long been felt, but because no particularly thorough opinions have emerged from either side, things have continued as they are until now, and likely will continue so.

However, this cannot go on indefinitely. Therefore, through the magazine "Sin Yŏsŏng" (New Woman), we are collecting opinions on clothing reform in order to widely exchange discussions on this matter with various individuals.

Opinions regarding clothing as a whole are welcome, and suggestions for improving even small parts are also fine. Please write down just your opinion and reasons as concisely as possible (illustrating with drawings is also acceptable) and send them to us. (Use 23 characters per line format)

(Especially to ensure this discussion reaches ordinary women, we request submissions be written in pure Hangul [純諺文] as much as possible.)

Deadline: October 15th of this year.

**Summary**

This 1924 announcement from *Kaebyŏk* magazine's "New Woman" section solicits reader opinions on reforming traditional Korean clothing (Chosŏn ot), citing its long-acknowledged impracticality and the lack of concrete proposals for change. It calls for concise submissions detailing opinions and reasons, allowing for illustrations, covering either wholesale reform or partial improvements, setting an October 15th deadline. Significantly, it explicitly requests submissions in pure Hangul to facilitate wider participation, especially among women. For historians, this article is valuable as it reflects the ongoing discourse on modernization, practicality versus tradition, and the evolving role of women within colonial Korean society. The focus on clothing reform touches upon themes of national identity, efficiency, and social change under Japanese colonial influence, while the emphasis on Hangul highlights efforts to engage broader segments of the population, particularly women, in these national conversations.
