餘墨 (Remaining Ink)

Autumn is high and the horses are fat, but in the neighboring country of China (麟邦 中國), separated only by a narrow strait (一葦 數), the heart-rending sounds of cannons from brothers fighting brothers (兄弟相殘) shake the mountains and rivers. The recklessness and ignorance of their struggle are beyond discussion, but we cannot help but feel terror regarding the safety and well-being of the 700,000 compatriots residing in China (在中 70만 동포).

Turning our gaze back to the Korean interior (朝鮮內地), our propertyless compatriots (無産同胞), already starving and cold in this unequal world, have been hit with the triple misfortune of floods, droughts, and hail (水災, 旱災, 雹災), adding frost to snow (雪上加霜). Even in the harvest season, their yield (所穫) is non-existent, leaving only sorrow and lamentation (憂愁悲歎). This year's autumn is an autumn of disaster, an autumn of many troubles.

Denouncing the misdeeds of an individual or group under reasonable grounds and conditions is a matter of course, but denunciation without reason or condition is a kind of epidemic. Unfortunately, several compatriots in Inch'ŏn and P'yŏngyang have succumbed to this illness (此病), misunderstood articles in this magazine (本誌 기사), and put forth theories of denunciation and censure (聲討非賀云云). Without any direct contact with our company, merely supplementing newspaper articles, they confuse the eyes and ears of the public, which is truly regrettable (千萬道憾). However, as this matter will ultimately be left entirely to public discourse (公論), we will not argue further for now. We only ask that they read the articles carefully and understand their true meaning (本意).

This month's issue is intended as a special enlarged issue (特別 增刊號). We aimed to make the content even more substantial to avoid disappointing the expectations (企望) of our readers everywhere, but due to many restrictive circumstances (不自由한 사정), we could not fully realize our initial intention (初意). However, as they say, there is truth amidst falsehood (虛虛實實), so even amid the shortcomings, there are points of substance. We hope you will read it thoroughly (윀˜만 - *Typo in original, likely meant '샅샅이' or similar, meaning 'thoroughly'*).

The "Glossary of Terms" (術語辭典), which was being published serially as a supplement for the magazine's 4th-anniversary issue, has unfortunately been discontinued due to the author's circumstances. Also, Mr. Yi Sŏngt'ae's (李星泰氏) continuing article titled "Nation and Class" (민족과 계급) has been postponed to the next issue due to space constraints (紙項의 관계). We ask especially for the understanding of our readers and Mr. Yi.

Pak Talch'un (朴達成君), who is exploring the Hamnam (咸南) region accompanied by the sight of wild geese (鴈影) on the cool northern frontier wind (北塞凉風), sends word that he is receiving much affection everywhere he goes and is also doing his work well. While expressing our gratitude especially to the compatriots there (當地 동포), we hope they will continue to show him affection until his return to the company. Furthermore, we raise a chrysanthemum cup (菊花盃) to toast the health of Ch'unp'a-kun (春坡君 - *likely Pak Talch'un's pen name*) from afar. <45>

**Summary**

This editorial afterword from the October 1924 issue of *Kaebyŏk* expresses concern over the civil war in China and its potential impact on Koreans living there, contrasts this with the severe hardships (poverty, natural disasters, crop failure) faced by Koreans domestically, and addresses a controversy where readers in Inch'ŏn and P'yŏngyang apparently criticized the magazine based on misunderstandings, urging them to read carefully. It apologizes for the current special issue not meeting expectations due to unspecified "restrictive circumstances" and announces the discontinuation of a serialized glossary and the postponement of an article on "Nation and Class" by Yi Sŏngt'ae. It concludes with an update on staff member Pak Talch'un's fieldwork in Hamnam province. For historians, the piece reveals contemporary Korean awareness of regional instability (China), the grim reality of life under colonial rule (poverty, disasters described as "재앙의 秋" - autumn of disaster), the intellectual ferment (mention of "Nation and Class"), the challenges faced by the press (censorship implied by "restrictive circumstances," public criticism), and the activities of Korean intellectuals/journalists during this period.

餘墨
秋는 高하고 馬는肥하얏는데 一葦 數를 隔한 麟邦 中國에서는 兄弟相殘하는 애처러운 大砲聲이 山河를 震動한다 其爭鬪의 無謀無智는 更論할 餘地가 업거니와 특히 在中 70만 동포의 安危에 대하여 恐怖함을 마지안는다

다시 朝鮮內地를 살펴보면 불평등한 現世에 飢寒하는 無産同胞가 雪上加霜으로 水災, 旱災, 雹災를 兼당하야 추수기에도 所穫이 전무하고 憂愁悲歎할 뿐이니 금년의 秋는 재앙의 秋요 多事의 秋이다

상당한 이유와 상당한 조건하에 개인 혹 단체의 비행을 성토함은 당연한 事이지만 무이유 무조건의 성토는 일종의 유행병이다 불행이 인천, 평양의 幾個 동포가 此病에 懼하야 本誌 기사를 오해하고 聲討非賀云云의 說을 출하야 본사와는 직접 하등의 교섭도 無하고 但히 신문기사만 보충하야 세인의 耳目을 眩케 하는 것은 千萬道憾이 다 그러나 금일의 事는 전혀 公論에 付하고 말 것인 즉 구태여 논의치 안이하고 다만 부탁은 그 기사를 잘 보와 本意를 이해하라고 할 뿐이다.

今月 號는 특별 增刊號다 생각까지는 내용을 저€더 충실히 하야 만천하 애독자 諸氏의 企望을 孤負치 안으랴고 하얏스나 不自由한 사정이 만히 잇서 또한 初意를 관철치 못하얏다 그러나 虛虛實實이라고 불충실한 중에도 충실한 점이 업지 안이한 즉 윀˜만 읽어 주기를 바란다

본지 4주년 기념호 부록으로 계속 발표하던 術語辭典은 저자의 사정에 인하야 유감이나마 중지하게 되고 또 李星泰씨의 민족과 계급이란 題의 繼續文은 紙項의 관계로 來號에 讓하게 되얏다 특히 애독자와 이씨에게 양해를 구한다

北塞凉風에 鴈影을 伴하야 咸南 일대를 답사하는 朴達成君은 도처마다 만흔 사랑을 밧고 또한 일도 잘 본다고 소식을 傳한다 특히 當地 동포에게 감사의 意를 표하는 동시 歸社할 때까지 더욱 사랑하야 주시기를 바라며 兼又 菊花盃를 擧하야 春坡君의 건강을 遠祝한다.＜45＞
