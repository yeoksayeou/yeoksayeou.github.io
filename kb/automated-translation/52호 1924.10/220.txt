Story of the Dadaist Who Came to Seoul
						Ko Han-yong

On September 1, 1924, the Japanese Dada poet Mr. Takahashi Shinkichi arrived. He hadn't come for any particular reason, but rather, having set out on a so-called Dada-style walk to a place called Beppu, he ended up coming all the way to Korea—though he mentioned he took transport instead of casually walking the whole way. However, on the afternoon of the 15th, he said he was heading home again by train, but it seemed that not only I, but even he himself, didn't know where he was going.

The stories of the fifteen days spent together, his personality, and his principles are a bit difficult to express without resorting to something like the form of a novel, so I will postpone that for a later, more leisurely time. For now, I will introduce a bit of the draft he intended to deliver as a lecture here, exactly as it was. However, this was neither something he wrote down himself with a brush, nor something he was set on delivering as a speech. Although Dada is not really the sort of thing one gives a lecture on, the opportunity seemed good, so I asked if he would give one. But even vaguely, I didn't know what might come out of his mouth, so after much hesitation, I asked him if it wouldn't be better to let me hear what he intended to say first, just in case. This was because when he spoke in Kōbe some time ago, an order to stop was issued. It wasn't because he said anything politically subversive or otherwise problematic, but apparently, he said something so utterly unexpected that the audience erupted, leading to that outcome. Fearing he might get into trouble again this time—and trouble is a loss (損)—I asked, and he readily agreed. At that time, thinking "Even if someone else were to interpret...", I sat beside him and tried to begin taking notes roughly. Then, he stopped smiling brightly, stood up, thought for a moment, and this is what he said:

"私は高橋新吉ではない. 私はダダ新吉ではない. 私はダガバジマツクアウリではない. 高橋と云ふ人間＜146＞がどんなものであるか知らない..."
("I am not Takahashi Shinkichi. I am not Dada Shinkichi. I am not Dagabajimatsukuauri. I do not know what kind of person this Takahashi is...")

"Don't be like that. Why are you doing this here..."

"What, is it funny?"

"No, it doesn't matter among Dadaists, but still, coming here and acting like that..."

"Alright, I'll start again..."

"私はダダに就いてお話をします. 私はダダに就いてお話をしますと言つたのであります. 私はダダに就いて色んなことを知つて居るのであります. "
("I will speak about Dada. I said that I would speak about Dada. I know various things about Dada.")

"Please, I told you not to..."

"エーと人間は忘れる事が出來る. どんなことを忘れてしまつてもいい. だから私はダダの事を忘れてしまつた. だから外の話をしなければならない. "
("Uh, humans can forget. It's alright to forget anything. Therefore, I have forgotten about Dada. Therefore, I must talk about something else.")

"Again..."

"私はダダのことを話しようと思つてこの演壇に上がりましたが, アイ憎ダダのことは忘れてしまひまして, ダダがどんなものであるか思ひ出さうと思つてもオモヒ出せないのであります. 私は非常に頭の悪い人間でありまして, よく物事を忘れて不可ない. 實にくたらない人間なのであります. "
("I came up to this podium intending to speak about Dada, but ah, damn Dada, I've forgotten about it, and even if I try to remember what Dada is, I cannot recall it. I am an extremely dull-witted person, often forgetting things, which is unacceptable. Truly a worthless human being.")

"Really, this person..."

"Ung—Abogya!" (Sounds like nonsense syllables or baby talk)

"Dagabajimalgwa uri!" (More nonsense syllables/names?)

"エーと, 私はダダのことに就いてお話する事は出來ないのであります. なぜなればダダと云ふものは人間の頭では考へることの出來ないものであるから, どんなに考へてもダダの實體を握む事は出來ない. ダダは實在している所のものではない. 此れがダダだと諸君に示すべきどころの何物も知らないものであります. 斯う言つたからとて 私はダダを神樣の如く祭り上げようとするのではない. 私はダダなんてどんなものか＜147＞知らない者であると私かこう言つたら-諸君は怒つてもかまわない. それは諸君の自由だ. 我々は人間である. 我々は人間であろうか. 我々は人間と云ふものがどんなものであるか知らないのである..."
("Um, I cannot speak about Dada. Because Dada is something that cannot be conceived by the human mind, no matter how much one thinks, one cannot grasp the true substance of Dada. Dada is not something that exists in reality. I know nothing that I could show you gentlemen and say, 'This is Dada.' Just because I say this doesn't mean I intend to elevate Dada like a god. If I say that I am someone who doesn't know what Dada <147> is—you gentlemen may get angry, that doesn't matter. That is your freedom. We are human. Are we human? We do not know what kind of thing a human being is...")

From this point, his mood began to shift slightly. Gradually adopting a solemn expression, he spoke slowly. However, it took quite some time for his emotions to settle down enough to speak like this. His attitude, imperceptible to others' eyes, and his personality, unbearable in its strangeness, along with Mr. Shinkichi's unique Dada, probably cannot be loved unless one is a fellow Dadaist. Since Dada has no set path, it lacks the fixed 'something' that other doctrines have, but compared to Western Dadaists, there are many differences—places where it is much more thoroughgoing. Reading things like his manifestos gives me far more flavor than common philosophy or sickly sweet literary works; I don't know how much. First, let me transcribe here what he said, just as I noted it down.

"Happiness passed like a herd of colossal elephants, said one Dadaist. Happiness cannot be found no matter where one searches. I too once said that happiness was mixed in with two or three of a woman's nose hairs. If that's the case, the question of what kind of thing happiness might be becomes unnecessary once we determine that happiness exists nowhere in this life. As many people have said until now, the moment happiness is obtained, it ceases to be happiness. Perhaps it always remains an ideal, dwelling in the world of illusion (イリヤ - Iriya, possibly Ilya/Illusion?). However, many people today believe they live constantly pursuing happiness. Even the petty person who says, 'I can't attain happiness anymore, so I'll die,' is seeking something called happiness in death. But—let's leave the problem of happiness at this.
'I oppose all cosmic power that vibrates beneath the putrefying sun.' This is also the declaration of a certain Dadaist. He has despaired of everything. There is nothing to delight his eyes. He cannot find any work into which he can pour his passion. He has closed his eyes to all the pleasures of this world. He has already stopped moving. He no longer desires anything. Everything seems foolish to him.
Within the minds of the many pessimists or nihilists <148> who see even the sun shining in the sky as rotten like the flesh of a leper patient, such ideals are crouching. I detest objectivity and harmony. Philosophy and religion seek objectivity and harmony more and more. However, for the Dadaist who regards all worldviews as a mere jumble of words, Buddha's religion and Einstein's cosmology are equally worthless. Then, what philosophy does Dada establish, and what religion does it intend to rely on? Is it merely something that declares that even things which have left great traces on humanity until now are nothing? Is Dada merely a stool (コシカケ - koshikake), is it like a bed on which one lies down to rest one's bones? Let's put aside these questions and continue.
Let me read here the manifesto I published in 1922. It is titled 'Assertion is Dadaist.' That is, the word 'assertion' itself means Dadaist. Dada asserts and negates everything. Infinity or nothingness, they resonate with the same sound as tobacco or single words. Everything that springs from imagination (像想 - zōsō) exists in reality. The entire past is contained within the future of natto (fermented soybeans). Spatulas (シャクシ - shakushi) and cats also imagine that one can imagine what lies beyond human imagination through stones and sardine heads. Dada sees the self even in the vibration of air, in the hatred of bacteria, in the phrase 'the self.' Assertion is everything. The universe is soap (石䶨 - sekken). Soap is trousers (ズボン - zubon). Everything is non-dual (不二 - funi). Christ pasted on a folding fan wrote a love letter to agar jelly (ところてん - tokoroten). Everything altogether is true. Could Mr. Gott, who does not smoke, possibly imagine things that cannot be asserted? Christ said God is almighty. Dada asserts that everything is almighty. Therefore, it asserts that the almighty, even if throwing a single meal's lightbulb into the Sea of Okhotsk, is something that sometimes lights up over there. Everything is non-dual. From Buddha's perspective (蹄觀 - teikan? perhaps 諦観 - contemplation), the words 'everything is everything' emerge. One sees everything in everything. Assertion is everything.
Dada negates everything. Tears it to pieces. Becomes utterly reckless (無二無三 - munimusan), and takes a strained piss (無理な小便 - muri na shōben) in the realm of nothingness. Buddha could not retreat even an ant's breadth from there. Dada knows no stagnation. Dada surrounds everything. Nothing can fall in love with Dada. Dada stands tall (聳立 - shōritsu). Dada adheres to everything. It does not evade anything. Matsukuauri (マツクアウリ), who ceased to feel contradiction or rhythm in things, <149> did not fail to become a Dadaist, did he? Contradiction and rhythm are Dadaist. Everything can be changed like clothes (穿き變へられ得る - hakikaerareru). Change is value, value is Dadaist. Who could say that Dadaists are inedible? Everything is food, food is anarchist. —and so on, he writes at length. But let's stop quoting here. Even from what I've said so far, you gentlemen must have gained an awareness of Dadaists. I am a Dadaist. If each of you gentlemen attains this self-awareness, then I must change what I talk to you about to something else, or perhaps it would be better if we sang the Arirang T'aryŏng song together. If someone were told, 'You are Korean,' no Korean person would likely get angry. I merely hope that there are no humans who feel shame when told, 'You are a Dadaist.' I will refrain from saying anything further about what is meaningless.

As those who have read his book "Dada" (ダダ) know, he was in an extremely agitated state for several months some time ago. On the surface, people gossiped that he had gone mad, and his actions indeed did not deviate from that perception, but if that were true, there is absolutely no way his memory of that time would remain so clear. Even Professor Sugita of the Imperial University wrote a review of "Dada," saying he had obtained unprecedented and unique reference material from a medical perspective, but perhaps the day will come when one realizes they laughed in vain if they view it purely as the record of a madman. Scenes in "Dada" around the time Mr. Shinkichi jumps off a train possess a bold light that transcends the petty calculations of a normal person jumping off a train, and the powerful cry of Dada. However, this world does not consider that these are deeds done from the thoroughgoing state of Dada and a condition of extreme excitement. Having been detained and arrested more than twenty times back and forth within a short period, and experiencing unspeakable hardships while wandering through various regions, he became quite ill, suffering from bone disease (骨病 - perhaps meaning deep-seated illness or exhaustion). When he came this time too, although much calmer than before, he seemed to feel physical fatigue easily and, at times, appeared unable to calm his own confused mind. Looking at what he said below, one can grasp his recent mood and his confused mental state even amidst the calmness.

"私は今實に中ぶらりんな心持で居る. 私の精神はだらけ切つて居る. 私は多くの人人と混つて, 互に意見を交換したり或は多くの人人の前で自分の考へを公開したりすることは 最つとも適しない所の困憊し盡＜150＞した身體を荷つて居る. 私は自らの頭を信する事が出來なくなつて居る, 此處に立つて居るのはお前か? こう私は自分に聞いて見る. 何あにこんものは俺ではない. 俺は此んな處に居るわけはないてはないかと, 私の頭の中には誰が私でない他の人間が坐り込んで考へて居るのではないかと私は思つたりもする. 私は-とこう呌ぶ時私は何處に居るのであらろかと, 本當の私であらうか, 凡ての物を見るにはその盾の兩面を見るが如くしなければならないと, 斯う言つたりするのは私は何にも特別な事を言はうとするのではない. 汝じ自身を知れ!　自分自身を知るといふことは如何なる方法で以つてしなげればならないか, 自分自身を知るといふ事はどんな手段をしてするのが一番いいかといふことに就いては, 一言も昔の人が言つてくれていない事は確かに悲しむべき残念なことである. "
("Right now, I truly feel suspended in mid-air. My spirit is utterly slack. I bear a body completely exhausted <150>, most unsuitable for mixing with many people, exchanging opinions, or revealing my thoughts before a large audience. I have become unable to trust my own head. Is it you standing here? I ask myself this. What, this thing isn't me. Isn't it that I couldn't possibly be in such a place? I sometimes even think that perhaps some other person who is not me is sitting inside my head, thinking. When I shout 'I am—', where might I be, I wonder? Am I the real me? Saying things like 'One must see both sides of the shield to see all things'—by saying this, I am not trying to say anything special. Know thyself! As for what method one must use to know oneself, what means is best for knowing oneself—it is certainly a lamentable and regrettable fact that the people of old did not tell us a single word about this.")

The above came about one evening when we were sitting together and talking, and the subject of giving a lecture came up, leading to me taking these notes. However, due to circumstances, the planned lecture didn't happen, but I wonder what it would have been like if he had spoken seriously with a slightly calmer mind. Just as a Dada lecture isn't really something one can 'do,' it is truly somewhat expensive (빗싼 것 - perhaps meaning 'precious' or 'costly' in effort/implication).

Dadaism Tsuji Jun
Dagabajism Namu Kwa-sŭng (舐瓜僧 - Licking Gourd Monk? A nickname?)
Nihilism Ōizumi Kokuseki
Seikiyapochijourai Takebayashi Musōan

There was apparently an attempt to hold an event in Tokyo previously with a program like this, but it fizzled out when Mr. Shinkichi was arrested. This time too, if it had been possible, it might have been feasible to invite Mr. Tsuji Jun, who holds great goodwill towards Korea, even by telegram, and try to hold one, but as there seemed to be no one willing to host it with goodwill, I mentioned it in one or two places and then gave up. <151> Thus, the Dada lecture in Kyŏngsŏng ended up happening only in the back room of my house, as described above. However, the Ōsaka Mainichi Shinbun (September 14th) had sharp ears, running a story under the headline "Takahashi Shinkichi Appears in Keijō (京城 - Kyŏngsŏng/Seoul)," stating that a lecture was being planned. Not only that, but it confidently reported, as if witnessed firsthand, that Mr. [Takahashi] was walking along Honmachidōri (本町通 - Ponjŏng, now Chungmu-ro) with a blanket slung over his shoulder, loudly proclaiming "Dada," but that is just baseless speculation. Although he did walk around places like Kwanghwamun T'ong (光化門通 - now Sejong-daero) a few times holding a long bamboo pipe and making baby noises (아감보죠소리), he likely never even touched a blanket while in Kyŏngsŏng.

However, no matter what they write, it's irrelevant, but next, I want to borrow and present a piece he wrote while in Korea. Among us, who are communists even in our works and emotions, borrowing a little bit doesn't matter, but just to maintain appearances, let's share only one.

By the way, this was written inside a streetcar one bright moonlit night while heading out to the Han River for fun. Inside the car, he suddenly told me to bend my waist, and I wondered what he meant. Since he often did strange things, I wondered what he was up to now, but anyway, I bent over, and he started writing a poem on a cigarette pack, using my back ("잔등") as a support. At that time, a woman named R was also in our group.

桃と柿とのアイノコを食べた
李さん
今夜は漢江の月を蔑んで
東大門の鳥でもあるまいし
行こうよ
電車に乘つて

(Ate the peach-persimmon hybrid
Mr. Yi
Tonight let's scorn the Han River moon
We're not birds of the East Gate, after all
Let's go
Riding the streetcar)

Besides this, there are several other poems, such as one written in T'apdong Park and one in a tavern (선술집), but since those written in Korea are his personal "souvenirs" (土産 - miyage), I will leave them out.

Mr. [Takahashi], who left secretly because revealing himself would cause trouble, just departed. It is doubtful how many people's hearts retain the traces of Dada he left behind, but expressions beyond silence are few. <152>
I wonder if the friend whom I love and respect endlessly is doing well, having left without further thought. The image of his long hair in the train window at Yongsan Station still remains.
Finally, here are three Dada poems written in his own hand.

深山大海のヌーボーを敎へて下され
(I'll give you twenty days' worth of me
Please teach me the nouveau of deep mountains and great seas)

The echo of tedium emerges)
<146-153>

**Summary**

This article by Ko Han-yong recounts the spontaneous two-week visit of Japanese Dadaist poet Takahashi Shinkichi to Seoul in September 1924. Ko describes Takahashi's eccentric personality, their interactions, and the core tenets of Takahashi's Dadaism, which emphasized irrationality, negation of established values, contradiction, and the questioning of reality and self-identity. The article includes excerpts from Takahashi's planned (but cancelled) lecture, revealing his provocative and nonsensical style, along with several of his Dada poems, some written during his stay in Korea. It touches upon Takahashi's past struggles, including repeated arrests in Japan, and his physically and mentally fragile state during the visit. Historically, this piece offers a valuable glimpse into the transnational flow of avant-garde artistic ideas (Dadaism) into colonial Korea and the personal interactions between Japanese and Korean intellectuals amidst the backdrop of colonial rule and surveillance. The casual mention of Takahashi's troubles with authorities and the author's cautious handling of the lecture plan subtly reflect the restrictive environment.

一九二四年九月一日, 日本의 詩人 高橋新吉君이 왓섯다. 별로히 무슨 일이 잇서 온 것이 안이라 別府라는 곳지 所謂 式散步를 나왓다가 아조 朝鮮지-슬슬 거러오는 대신에 타고 왓다는 말이엿다. 그러나 十五日午後 다시 汽車를 타고 집으로 돌아가는 길이라고 갓스나 어대로 가게 되는 지는 나이 안이라 가는 自己도 모르는 모양갓다.

「私は高橋新吉ではない. 私はダダ新吉ではない. 私はダガバジマツクアウリではない. 高橋と云ふ人間＜146＞がどんなものであるか知らない...」

「다가바지말과 우리!」
「エーと, 私はダダのことに就いてお話する事は出來ないのであります. なぜなればダダと云ふものは人間の頭では考へることの出來ないものであるから, どんなに考へてもダダの實體を握む事は出來ない. ダダは實在している所のものではない. 此れがダダだと諸君に示すべきどころの何物も知らないものであります. 斯う言つたからとて 私はダダを神樣の如く祭り上げようとするのではない. 私はダダなんてどんなものか＜147＞知らない者であると私かこう言つたら-諸君は怒つてもかまわない. それは諸君の自由だ. 我々は人間である. 我々は人間であろうか. 我々は人間と云ふものがどんなものであるか知らないのである...」
이부터 그의 氣分은 족음 돌아서기 始作하엿다. 차차 嚴肅한 表情으로 變하야가지고 천천히 말을 하엿다. 그러나 이와가티 말하기지 그의 感情이 알마저지기에는 한참되는 時間이 걸니엿다. 남의 눈에는 아라보지 못 할 그의 態度와 異常하야 못견듸겟다 할 그의 性格이며 新吉君의 獨特한 DA, DA는 가튼 이스트가 안이면 사랑할 수 업슬 것이다. DA, DA는 엇더타는 軌道가 업스니 라서 다른 主義와 가티 一定한 무엇이 업스나, 西洋의 이스트보다도 만히 다른-더 만히 徹底한 곳이 잇다. 그의 宣言文 가튼 것은 흔한 哲學보다도 달큼한 文藝物보다도 읽는 맛이 나에게는 얼마나 만흔 것인지 모르겟다. 爲先 그가 말한대로 筆記하야 논 것을 여긔 옴기여보자.

「幸福は巨像の群の樣に過ぎたと一人のダダは言つた. 幸福と云ふものは何處をさがしても見附からない. 幸福は女の鼻毛に二三本混ぢつていたと, 僕も言つたことがある. それなればどんなものが幸福であろうかといふ問題は, 幸福と云ふものはこの人生どこにもないと斷定する以上どんなもんであると云ふことは不必要になつて來る. 多くの人々が今迄言つている樣に, 幸福と云ふものはそれを得た瞬間から幸福ではなくなる. 常にそれは理想に止り イリヤの世界に住むものであるかも知れない. 然し現在の多くの人々は, 常に幸福を追求めて生きていると思つていらつしやる. 俺はもう幸福が得られないから死なうとか言ふ小人ですら死に幸福と云ふものを求めていらつしやる. 然し-幸福の問題もこれくらいにしておこう.
「余は腐爛せる太陽の本に振動する宇宙的能力の一切に反對する」これも或るダダイストの宣言である. 彼は一切に絶望してしまつた. 彼の目を喜ばせるところの何物もない. 彼の熱を注ぐべき仕事も彼には見出す事が出來ない. 彼はこの世の一切快樂から目をつぶつてしまつて居る. 彼はもう動く事をよしてしまつた. 何にも慾つしなくなつた. 彼にはすべての事が馬鹿馬鹿しく見える.
空に輝く所の太陽も, 癩病患者の肉のそれの如く腐つていると見る多くの厭世主義者とか虛無主義とかい ＜148＞つていらつしやる人々の頭の中には, 斯くの如き理想がうづくまつている. 余は客觀と調和とを厭ふ. 哲學も宗敎も客觀と調和とをより多く求めている. けれども一切の世界觀は單語の交雜であると見なす所のダダイストに取つては, 佛陀の宗敎もアインスタインの宇宙觀も共に價値なきに等しい. 然らばダダは如何なる哲學を打ち立て, 如何なる宗敎に依らんとするものであらうか. 唯だ單に今迄の人類に偉大なる痕蹟を落したところのものも, 何んでもないもんだとする所のもんであろうか. ダダは單なるコシカケに過ぎないものであらうか, 寝ころんで骨休みをする所の寢臺の如きものであらうか といふ疑問をうち捨てでぢいて先を言ふことにしよう.
千九百二十二年に僕の發表したところの宣言をここで讀んで見よう. これには斷言はダダイストであると云ふ題が附いである. 即ち斷言といふ言葉がダダイストであるといふ意味なのである. ダダは一切を斷言し否定する. 無限とか無とか, それは煙草とか單語とか同音に響く. 像想に湧く一切は實在するのである. 一切の過去は納豆の未來に包含されでいる. 人間の像想以外を石や鰯の頭に依つて像想し得ると, シャクシも猫も像想する. ダダは空氣の振動にも細菌の憎惡にも自我と云ふ言葉の句にも自我を見るのである. 斷言は一切である. 宇宙は石䶨である. 石䶨はズボンだ一切は不二だ. 扇子にはりつけてあるクリストにところてんがラブレタを書いた. 一切合切本當である. 凡そ斷言し得られない事柄を像想することが, 喫煙しないミスタゴツトに可能であらうか. 神はオールマイチであるとクリストは言つた. ダダは一切のものがオールマイチだと斷言する. だからオールマイチは一食の電球をオホツク海に投じても時々そこの方で燈つているものだと斷言する. 一切は不二だ. 佛陀の蹄觀から一切は一切だといふ言葉が出る. 一切のものに一切を見るのである. 斷言は一切ある.
ダダは一切を否定する. 粉々に引裂く. 無二無三になつて, 無の所で無理な小便をする. 佛陀はそこから蟻ほども退く事だ出來なかつた. ダダは滯る處を知らない. ダダは一切を包圍する. 何ものもダダを戀する事が出來ない. ダダは聳立する. ダダは一切に拘泥する. 一切を徒避しない. 物事に矛盾や調子を感じなく ＜149＞なつたマツクアウリは, ダダイストに成り損ねなかつたではない. 矛盾や調子はダダイストなのである. 一切のものは穿き變へられ得る. 變化は價値だ, 價値はダダイストた. 誰がダダイストを食べられないものだと言ふであらうか. 一切は食物た, 食物は無政府主義者た. -とか長いことを書いている. だが玆に言ふ事はよさう. が今迄言つたことに依つても, 諸君はダダイストの自覺を持だれたことであらう. 自分はダダイストである. 諸君が各各自覺を持たれゝば, もう諸君に話すことは何にか他に變へなけらばならない, 或は諸君と共にアリランタリヨンの歌でも合唱しだ方がいいかも知らない. 君は朝鮮だとこう言われて立腹する朝鮮の人はないたらう. 君はダダイストだと, こう言われてそこに恥辱を感じたりする人間のないことを僕は望んで居ることに過ぎない. もうこの上何にが無意味だと言ふことは言わないことにしておく.

그의 著書 「ダダ」를 읽은 이는 알겟지만 그는 얼마 前의 數箇月을 極히 昻奮한 狀態에 잇섯다. 地上에서는 그를 發狂하엿다고 들고,  그의 行動도 거긔에 어그러짐이 업섯스나, 그럿타면 그의 記憶이 그와가티 明瞭히 남아 잇슬理가 萬無이다. 帝大의 杉田敎授가튼 이도 醫學上으로 보아서 前代未聞이고 唯一無二한 參考資料를 어덧다고 하야가며 「ダダ」의 評을 썻다지만, 그것을 純全히 狂者의 記錄으로만 보다가는 헛웃엇다고 할 날이 잇지 안이할가 한다. 「ダダ」에 나타난 新吉君이 汽車에서 여 나리는 前後의 場面가튼 것은, 사-닌이 汽車에서 여나리는 以上으로의 人間의 곰상스런 질을 벗어나는 大膽한 빗과, DA, DA의 힘세인 呌喚이 잇다. 그러나 DA, DA의 徹底한 境地와 極度의 興奮狀態에서 하는 짓임을 생각하야 주지 안이하는 이 世界이다. 얼마되지 안이하는 期間 안에 前後 二十餘回의 拘留와 檢束을 當하고 各地方으로 돌아단이는 사이에 말 못할 苦楚를 體驗하야 그는 아조 骨病든 몸이 되엿다. 이번에 왓슬 에도 前보다는 만히 冷靜하야젓스나 족음하면 몸의 疲勞를 感하고 로 混亂한 腦를 스스로 鎭靜할 수 업서하는 모양이엿다. 아레가티 말한 것으로 보아도 近日의 그의 氣分과 沈靜한 가운대도 混亂한 精神狀態를 아라볼 수 잇슬 것이다.
「私は今實に中ぶらりんな心持で居る. 私の精神はだらけ切つて居る. 私は多くの人人と混つて, 互に意見を交換したり或は多くの人人の前で自分の考へを公開したりすることは 最つとも適しない所の困憊し盡＜150＞した身體を荷つて居る. 私は自らの頭を信する事が出來なくなつて居る, 此處に立つて居るのはお前か? こう私は自分に聞いて見る. 何あにこんものは俺ではない. 俺は此んな處に居るわけはないてはないかと, 私の頭の中には誰が私でない他の人間が坐り込んで考へて居るのではないかと私は思つたりもする. 私は-とこう呌ぶ時私は何處に居るのであらろかと, 本當の私であらうか, 凡ての物を見るにはその盾の兩面を見るが如くしなければならないと, 斯う言つたりするのは私は何にも特別な事を言はうとするのではない. 汝じ自身を知れ!　自分自身を知るといふことは如何なる方法で以つてしなげればならないか, 自分自身を知ると云ふ事はどんな手段をしてするのが一番いいかといふことに就いては, 一言も昔の人が言つてくれていない事は確かに悲しむべき残念なことである. 」
以上은 어느날 저녁에 가티 안저 놀다가 講演하자는 이악이가 나서 이와가티 筆記하게지 된 것이다. 그러나 事情에 依하야 한다든 것은 하지도 못하고 바리엿지만, 萬若 족음 더 冷靜한 腦로 졍말 하야 보앗드면 엇더 하엿슬가 하고 생각한다. DA, DA의 講演이란 할만한 性質의 것이 안인 同時에 참말 족음 빗싼 것이다.

前에 이와가튼 푸로그람으로 東京서 한번 하려든 일이 잇섯스나 新吉君이 檢束을 當하야 고만 오무라젓섯다 한다. 이번에도 할 수만 잇섯드면, 朝鮮에 대단 好意를 가진 辻潤君을 電報로라도 請하야 가지고 한번 하야보기도 可能한 일이엿슬는지 모르나, 主催하야 줄 만한 好意를 가진 이도 업는 모양임으로 한두곳 말하야보다 고만두엇다.＜151＞ 그러 京城서의 DA, DA 講演은 以上과 가티 나의 집 골房속에서 하고 만 것이엿스나 大阪每日新聞(九月十四日) 은 귀도 밝아서, 高橋新吉이 京城에 나타낫다는 題目 아레 講演을 計劃中이라는 소리가 낫다. 만아니라 君이 本町通으로 담뇨를 억개에 둘너민채로 DA, DA를 高唱하드라고 아조 본 것가티 내노앗지만 그것은 짐작대고 하는 엉한 소리이다. 光化門通 等地에서 긴 長竹을 몰고 아감보죠소리는 몃번 하엿서도 京城와서 담뇨가튼 것은 만저보지도 못하엿슬 것이다.
그러나 제 아무리 쓰던지 그런것은 相關할 것 업지만 그다음에 朝鮮와서 지은 一篇을 비러노아 보련다. 作品과 感情에 지 共産主義인 우리들리는 若干 족음 비러온대도 相關이 업지만 체모 차리노라고 하나만 하자.
그런대 이것은 어느 달 밝은 날 밤 漢江으로 놀나 나가다가 電車안에서 쓴 것이다.-車안에서 안젓다 말고 나의 허리를 부리라니 무슨 소린가하엿다. 각금가다 이상야릇한 일을 잘하니  무슨 짓을 하려나하고 左右間 부려보앗더니 나의「잔등」에다 대고 담배질에 詩를 쓰기 始作하엿다. 그런데 그의 一行에는 女子인 R이 잇섯다.

桃と柿とのアイノコを食べた
李さん
今夜は漢江の月を蔑んで
東大門の鳥でもあるまいし
行こうよ

이밧게도 塔洞公園에서 지은 詩와 선술집에서 지은 詩 等 몃 篇이 잇스나 朝鮮서 쓴 것은 自己의「土産」이니 그만두기로한다.
알니여지면 귀찬은 일이 잇서 알내몰내가 바린 君은 고만 가바리엿다. DA, DA의 痕蹟을 몃몃 사람의 가슴 속에 남기여 놋코 갓는 지는 疑問이나 沈黙以外의 表現은 約干이다. ＜152＞
사랑하고 尊敬하야 마지안이하는 君이, 生覺업시 바로 잘가잇기나 한 지, 龍山驛頭의 車窓안에 그의 長髮의 面影이 아직 그대로 잇다.
마즈막으로 그의 붓으로 된 詩三篇을紹介하면 如下.
