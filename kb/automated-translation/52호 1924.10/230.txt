無題 (Untitled)
						S.F.Kaiser(作) 쥬요섭(譯)
He spoke thus:
Now I will go and proclaim
Against all the bribery (賄賂질) and greed (貪慾),
I will let the people hear your evil,
How they might reach the wisdom (智慧) they desire.

There is no such thing as freedom (自由) here now,
Only the rule (支配) of the noble masters (貴主人님들) of commerce (商業).
I will speak the truth (眞),
Fearing neither
The money-powered politicians (金力政治家), nor the profiteers (取利者),
Nor any other fool.

The crowds (群衆) shouting for Uncle Sam (엉클쌤/米國)
Will hear the truth from me.
Where there is no freedom of speech (言論의 自由),
Democracy (民主政治) is merely a falsehood (虛僞).
Those with plenty of money can, even in an instant,
Tear up laws (法律) that displease them.
Without even being able to think,
The people fall into ignorance (無智).
I intend to awaken them.

I will surely speak the truth that must be spoken,
In every marketplace (쟝터).
Oppression (壓迫) has become too bold;
I will insult (侮辱) it to its face (面前).
I will rouse the foolish masses (愚鈍한 民衆)<1>
And have them cast off their bonds (決縛).
Now is the time to cut the evil (邪惡한) ties,
To become wise (智慧스럽고) and brave (勇敢),
And to cease being foolish.

He departed with noble zeal (高貴한 熱心)
To make the truth known,
And also to make other people
Feel (感覺) the same passion (熱情) that he possessed.

He told the masses (民衆)
The various reasons (理由)
Why the government (政府) must surely fail (失敗).
He dared (敢) to launch a serious critique (重大한 論擊)
Against those in high positions (놉흔 地位).
That night, he slept in prison (獄).

End<2>

**Summary**

The poem narrates the story of an individual who resolves to fight against societal corruption, greed, and the suppression of freedom, particularly the lack of free speech under the dominance of commercial and political elites ("money-powered politicians," "profiteers"). He vows to awaken the ignorant masses by speaking the truth boldly in public spaces. Driven by noble passion, he denounces the powerful and explains why the government is failing, only to be imprisoned for his actions. From a historical perspective, this poem, published in colonial Korea in 1924, is significant. While ostensibly a translation of a foreign work possibly set elsewhere (implied by "Uncle Sam"), its themes of oppression, lack of free speech, critique of authority, the power of money over law, and the ultimate suppression of dissent would have resonated strongly with Korean readers under Japanese rule. Historians might find it interesting as an example of how potentially subversive ideas could be circulated through translation, using a foreign setting as a possible veil for criticizing the contemporary colonial reality. The finality of the reformer's imprisonment underscores the harsh consequences of resistance.

그는이러케말햇다
지금나는가서반포하리라

엉클쌤(米國)을위하야소래지르는그群衆들은
내게로부터그참을들으리라
言論의自由가업는곳엔
民主政治라는것도다만허위뿐일다
돈만흔놈들은순식간에라도
제비위에틀니는法律은찌저내버린다.
생각을해볼념도못내면서
백성들은無智속에빠지는도다,
나는그들을깨우치려한다.

나는꼭말해야할바참을말하리라
쟝터에서마다,
압박은넘우나담대해젓도다
나는그것을그面前에서모욕하리라,

지금은邪惡한맷음을끈허버리고
지혜스럽고도용감해지며

그는高貴한熱心으로떠나나왓다
참을알려주려고,
그러고또다른사람들도
제가가지고잇는그것과가튼熱情을
感覺하게하려고.

그는民衆에게
왜
政府가맛당히失敗할지
그여러理由를말해주엇다.
그는敢히놉흔地位에잇는사람들께
重大한論擊을날니엿다
그날밤에그는獄속에서잣다.
