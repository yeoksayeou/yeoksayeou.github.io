Errata
In this issue, page 76, regarding the "Situation of Korean Students Studying in China": Shanghai's male students "Five Hundred" is an error for "Five Hundred Sixty"; Nanjing's female students "Seventeen" is an error for "Fifteen"; Beijing's female students "Thirty" is an error for "One Hundred Twenty-One"; the total male students "One Thousand Three Hundred Ninety" is an error for "One Thousand Four Hundred Fifty"; the total female students "One Hundred Twenty" is an error for "Two Hundred Nine".<50>

**Summary**

This brief notice corrects numerical errors published on page 76 of the same issue concerning the number of Korean students (Chosŏnin) studying in major Chinese cities (Shanghai, Nanjing, Beijing) in 1924. It adjusts the figures for male and female students in specific cities and revises the overall totals for both genders. For historians, this errata provides specific, albeit corrected, data points on the Korean student population in China during the colonial period. It underscores the significant presence of Koreans pursuing education abroad, particularly in China, reflecting intellectual and nationalist movements, and offers quantifiable insight into their distribution across key urban centers.
