Ch'anyŏn-dong is located below Ami Mountain north of P'yŏngyang Prefecture; it is the place where kisaeng have been buried since ancient times ('burying the red').

嬋娟洞草綠萋萋, 敗粉殘香泣露凄.
The grass of Ch'anyŏn-dong is green and lush,
Faded powder, lingering scents, weep in the sorrowful dew.

最是無情原上土, 年年埋玉自高低.
Most unfeeling is the earth upon this plain,
Year after year, burying jade (beautiful women), naturally high and low.

觀妓
Kwan'gi (Watching Kisaeng)

浿上佳娥花揷頭, 多情多恨又多差.
On the P'ae River (Taedong River), beautiful women with flowers in their hair,
Much affection, much resentment, and also much variance.

無端更唱愁心曲.不是愁人也動愁.
Without reason, they sing again a song of sorrowful heart,
Even one not sorrowful is moved to sorrow.

月夜泛舟遊於大同橋下

大同江上大同橋, 橋外垂楊綠萬條.
On the Taedong River, the Taedong Bridge,
Beyond the bridge, weeping willows, ten thousand green strands.

十里笙歌無限夜, 搖搖㧓棹壓殘潮.
Ten leagues of pipes and song on a limitless night,
Rocking and rowing (搖搖㧓棹) against the receding tide.

第一舘在平壤府水玉里當豪朴經錫君所築常設活動寫眞舘也
The Cheil-gwan is located in Suyong-ni, P'yŏngyang Prefecture. It is a permanently established motion picture hall (活動寫眞舘) built by the wealthy Mr. Pak Kyŏngsŏk.

第一舘前燭似銀, 亂笙急管閙三隣.
Before the First Hall, the lights are like silver,
Chaotic pipes and hurried flutes disturb the neighbors all around.

西京年少多輕薄, 不看古書看寫眞.
The youth of the Western Capital are mostly frivolous,
They don't read old books, they watch motion pictures (寫眞).

乙密臺
Ŭlmil-tae (Ŭlmil Terrace)

乙密仙人去不回, 白雲千載一空臺.
The Immortal of Ŭlmil departed and does not return,
White clouds for a thousand years, a single empty terrace.

至今惟有城東月, 依舊淸光照客盃.
Now, there is only the moon east of the fortress wall,
Its clear light, as of old, shines upon the traveler's cup.

**Summary**

This collection of five short poems in Classical Chinese by "Ch'ŏng'o" offers glimpses into P'yŏngyang (Sŏgyŏng, the "Western Capital") in 1924. The poems touch upon traditional sites and themes: the melancholic beauty and history of Ch'anyŏn-dong, the burial ground for kisaeng; the complex emotions evoked by watching kisaeng perform; the timeless scenery of boating on the Taedong River under the moon. However, it also contrasts this with modernity: the noisy, popular cinema (Cheil-gwan) attracting frivolous youth away from classical learning. The final poem reflects on the historical site of Ŭlmil Terrace, evoking a sense of loss and the passage of time, yet finding solace in the unchanging moon. For historians, the juxtaposition of traditional aesthetics (kisaeng, Hansi poetry, historical sites, river scenery) with the arrival of modern entertainment (cinema) and social commentary on the changing interests of youth provides a valuable snapshot of cultural shifts in colonial P'yŏngyang. The mention of a specific cinema built by a named individual adds concrete detail to the urban landscape of the time.
