To the Readers of Kaebyŏk, Seeking Opinions on the Reform of Korean Clothing

The various inconveniences and disadvantages of traditional Korean clothing (朝鮮衣服) have been felt for some time, but because no particularly thorough opinions have emerged among us, it has passed by as is until now, and likely will continue to do so.

However, as this cannot continue indefinitely, we, through the magazine "New Woman" (新女性), intend to widely exchange discussions on this matter with various personages, and are thus soliciting opinions regarding clothing reform.

Opinions concerning the entirety of clothing are welcome, and opinions on reforming even a small part are also welcome. Please record just your ideas and reasons as concisely as possible (explaining with illustrations is also fine) and send them to us. (23 characters per line format)

(Especially to ensure this discussion reaches the general female populace, we request pure Hangul (純諺文) submissions as much as possible.)

Deadline: October 15th of this year.

Kaebyŏk Company, New Woman Department Paek <50>

**Summary**

This announcement from the *Kaebyŏk* magazine's "New Woman" section calls for reader submissions regarding the reform of traditional Korean clothing (*hanbok*). Acknowledging the long-felt inconveniences of existing attire, the editors solicit concrete opinions and reasons, whether about clothing overall or specific parts, encouraging concise submissions, potentially with illustrations, and preferably in pure Hangul to reach a wider female audience. The deadline is set for October 15, 1924. This article is significant as it reflects the active discourse surrounding modernization and practicality versus tradition in colonial Korea. Historians might find it interesting for its focus on clothing reform as a site of social debate, the explicit attempt to engage women in this discussion through a women's section and the request for Hangul submissions, and its link to broader themes of cultural change and national identity under colonial rule.
