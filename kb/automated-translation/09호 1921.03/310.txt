Company Announcement

The "Kaebyŏk" public trial case, which had been problematic, had been under deliberation at the Kyŏngsŏng District Court. The arguments concluded on February 17th, and the verdict was announced on the 24th of the same month. As was the case with the summary disposition by the Tongdaemun Police Station, it was said that a fine of fifty *wŏn* (圓) was imposed.

Kaebyŏk Company<146>

**Summary**

This brief announcement from the Kaebyŏk Company states that the public trial concerning their magazine "Kaebyŏk," previously handled by the Kyŏngsŏng District Court, concluded on February 24th, 1921. The court upheld the earlier summary disposition by the Tongdaemun Police Station, imposing a fine of fifty *wŏn*. For historians, this article highlights the legal pressures and censorship faced by Korean publications like *Kaebyŏk* under Japanese colonial rule, documenting a specific instance of official action (a fine) taken against the magazine, likely for its content deemed problematic by authorities.
