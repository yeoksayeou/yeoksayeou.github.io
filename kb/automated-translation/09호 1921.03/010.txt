謝告 (Apology Notice)

Regarding Issue No. 9 of this magazine, published on March 1st, the sections spanning from the Foreword on page 1, the articles (論文) from page 2 to page 14, and from page 101 to the upper part of page 102, touched upon matters deemed taboo (忌諱) by the authorities (當局). Consequently, on the very day of publication, they were subjected to a sales ban. We had no choice but to remove the offending parts and issue a temporary version as an emergency measure (臨時變通); indeed, it feels as though we are presenting something headless before you all. Simultaneously, when we imagine how disappointed you must be upon encountering this, we are overcome with fear and emotion (悚極感極), truly at a loss for words. However, could this possibly be our true intention (本意)? We only think of paying further attention and exerting further effort so that we may long be brothers and true companions, as the coming days are also infinite (無窮).

**Summary**

This notice from the Gaebyeok Editorial Office apologizes to readers for the heavy censorship of Issue 9, published on March 1, 1921. Several sections, including the foreword and significant portions of articles, were removed by the authorities (當局) on the publication date due to sensitive content (忌諱), forcing the release of a temporary, incomplete version. The editors express deep regret but also a resolve to persevere and continue serving their readers in the future. The article is historically significant as a direct testament to the stringent censorship imposed by the Japanese colonial authorities on Korean publications. It highlights the difficult operating environment for Korean intellectuals and publishers and reveals their coded language of apology mixed with determination, which historians find valuable for understanding press control and cultural resistance during the period.
