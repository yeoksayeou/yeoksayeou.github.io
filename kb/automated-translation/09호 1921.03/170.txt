漢詩
						偶丁

殘冬 (Late Winter)
How many days remain of late winter?
Wind and snow fill the window lattice.
Having a room, it merely grows white.
Having no books to pass the time ("kill the green").
In my chest, the "Discussion on Making All Things Equal" (齊物論).
On the desk, the "Scripture of Human Salvation" (度人經).
Wishing to speak, whom can I rely on to tell?
Idly calling the frozen sparrows to listen.

歲除 (New Year's Eve)
On the left, arranged plum blossoms and stone narcissus.
In the center, for a moment, I shrug my poetry-reciting shoulders.
On New Year's Eve, I personally calculate the passing time.
Again, another year has passed amidst poetry.

元旦 (New Year's Day)
Bright, bright morning sun marks the New Year's beginning.
Gradually, I perceive the scenery of the New Year is fresh.
Plum blossoms that endured the year are still in bud.
Leaning by the gate, willows naturally lie spread out.
Snowy white, the three-room house. (*Character before 然 missing/illegible*)
The East Wind arranges spring across the four seas.
Before congratulating guests tomorrow, I first congratulate myself—
On my parent in the high hall, seventy-seven years of age.

春風 (Spring Wind)
The spring wind is like an honored guest.
Once it arrives, flourishing beauty immediately follows.
It comes to sweep away the snow of a thousand mountains.
It departs, leaving behind the flowers of myriad lands.
Affectionately, the silk curtains are rolled up.
Powerlessly, the paper kite slants.
It is accustomed to sending news of the plum blossoms
To the home of the recluse on Gushan (孤山).

尋春 (Seeking Spring)
In the New Year, there's no way to console this aging man.
On a spring day, seeking spring in the small garden.
I try asking for news of the plum blossoms beyond the pass—
How many times has the wind blown until now?

梅 (Plum Blossom)
In the first month, the east wind blows, willows not yet budded.
In the courtyard, plum shadows slant across the snow.
Why is its character so esteemed?
Simply because it can bloom in a cold place.<92>

**Summary**

This collection of six classical Chinese poems (Hansi) by Ujŏng (偶丁), published in the March 1921 issue of *Kaebyŏk* magazine, follows traditional themes associated with the transition from winter to spring. The poems reflect on the passage of time ("New Year's Eve"), the solitude and contemplation of late winter ("Late Winter"), the freshness of the New Year ("New Year's Day"), the arrival of spring ("Spring Wind," "Seeking Spring"), and the admired resilience of the plum blossom ("Plum Blossom"). The author blends personal feelings, such as contemplation of aging and celebrating a parent's longevity, with observations of nature and references to classical Chinese philosophy (Zhuangzi) and Daoism (Scripture of Human Salvation). For historians studying colonial Korea, these poems are interesting as they demonstrate the continued practice and appreciation of classical Chinese literary forms and themes among Korean intellectuals in the early 1920s, even amidst burgeoning modern Korean literature and nationalist movements. The poems offer insight into the private sentiments and cultural grounding of individuals within the context of Japanese rule, showcasing a connection to East Asian literati traditions.
