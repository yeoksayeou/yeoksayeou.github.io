Every Morning
Every morning, every morning
A little bird
Comes before my window
With a sorrowful voice
Cries! Cries!
Cries! Cries!
With the same voice,
Inside my heart too
A little bird
Every morning! Every morning! (End) <111>

**Summary**

The poem describes a small bird that comes to the speaker's window every morning and cries with a sorrowful voice. This external event is mirrored internally, as the speaker feels a similar "little bird" crying within their own heart with the same voice, every morning. The poem evokes a sense of persistent, inescapable sorrow. Published on the anniversary of the March 1st Movement (March 1st, 1921), historians might find the poem significant as a possible allegory for the suppressed grief and enduring suffering of the Korean people under Japanese colonial rule, using the imagery of a crying bird to express collective mourning or despair in a potentially censored environment.
