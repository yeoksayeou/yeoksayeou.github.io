Kaesŏng's Tennis Match, Great Success Breaking Precedent
						A Reporter from the Kaesŏng Branch

First Day

The 3rd Kaesŏng Tennis Tournament, hosted by the Kaesŏng Branches of Kaebyŏk Publishing Company and Sinsaenghwal Company, and sponsored by the Kaesŏng Bureau of the Tonga Ilbo Company, opened on January 11th at 2 PM at the Kaesŏng Monopoly Bureau court. Before the scheduled time, spectators formed a sea of people, and the atmosphere inside the venue was quite tense. When the time came, 15 teams of players gathered spiritedly inside the venue, drew lots, and after the opening address by Branch Manager Ha, made a quiet entrance. Following the ceremony for returning the championship flag (which Songdo High School had won twice), Chief Manager Mr. Yi Hŭich'ang explained the competition rules. Under the judgment of Messrs. Yi Hŭich'ang and Im Hanhyŏn, the start of the competition was declared, and the cheers of several thousand people shook the venue.

On that day, Mr. Kim Yŏngsik from the Sinsaenghwal Company headquarters attended. The players fought each other, exhausting all their strength and skill. The results of the first round were as follows.

As the matches continued as above, the remaining matches were decided to be continued the next day due to time constraints, and the first day's competition concluded successfully amidst great enthusiasm.

Second Day

The remaining matches of the 2nd preliminary round from yesterday were set to continue today (May 12th) from 3 PM. Mr. Kim Kiho specially attended from the Kaebyŏk Company headquarters.

Dubbed the battle for the glorious championship flag, the Songdo High School (松高) cheering squad densely filled the venue, and the spectators, numbering even more than yesterday, packed the venue tightly before the scheduled time. Because this was truly a heated battle between top-tier players, the applause from the spectators and the cheering from the Songdo High contingent were indeed spectacular. The results were as follows. <52>

2nd Preliminary Round (Continued)
(Yun Sangun Kim Yŏn'gak vs. Kim Hŭnggil Kim Hŭngsun)
(Han Chin'yŏng Yu Ŭnsang vs. Kim Myŏnghwan Son Hŭngyun) (*Translator's note: The article text here mistakenly lists Kim Myŏngsik (金明植) but later consistently refers to the Hwimun pair as Kim Myŏnghwan (金明桓), Son Hŭngyun (孫興允). Assuming Kim Myŏngsik is a typo for Kim Myŏnghwan*)

The match that drew the most interest and anticipation in this round was the battle between the Songdo High team, Han-Yu pair, and the Hwimun (徽文) team, Kim-Son pair (*Translator's note: Corrected from Chŏn-Son based on later text identifying the Hwimun pair as Kim Myŏnghwan, Son Hŭngyun*). Their skills during the fight were truly wondrous and marvelous. The fierce battle continued for several tens of minutes, with each side giving their all, but in the end, the Songdo High team suffered defeat at the hands of the Hwimun team. At this time, there was no one among the spectators who was not resentful about Songdo High's defeat. It was truly a thrilling and spectacular match. Consequently, the 400-500 Songdo High students, who had been responding with soaring spirits, could not help but be disappointed.

3rd Preliminary Round
(Kim Hŭnggil Kim Hŭngsun vs. Pak Yonghak Yi Yŏn'ŏp)
(Yu Kaedong Pang Kyehyŏn vs. Kim Myŏnghwan Son Hŭngyun)

After the 3rd round matches finished, the Yu-Pang pair was also defeated, leaving no Songdo High teams remaining. Now, the leader of the Southern Epwet Army (南部 엡웻軍), the Kaesŏng "Pockmarked" team (開城 곰보組), faced off against the brave generals of the Hwimun team, the Kim-Son pair. Thus, several thousand spectators, with tense faces, fixed their gazes intently on the court, wondering who would indeed take home the championship flag.

Finally, the match began. It was generally acknowledged that this time, the "Pockmarked" Captains (곰보大將) would surely win. However, things did not go as expected, and ultimately, the "Pockmarked" Captains, after a fierce battle of several tens of minutes with the Hwimun team, could not avoid defeat.

During each moment the ball went back and forth, it was thrilling to the point of making one dizzy.

Ultimately, the honorable championship flag went permanently to the Hwimun pair, Kim Myŏnghwan and Son Hŭngyun. How resentful must the Songdo High contingent be, having it snatched away after winning it twice consecutively?

(Kim Myŏnghwan Son Hŭngyun vs. Kim Hŭnggil Kim Hŭngsun)

Thus, the Branch Manager awarded the championship flag and one silver medal (銀「메탈」) each to the Hwimun team, the brave generals undaunted through a hundred battles. After distributing books donated by both headquarters (Kaebyŏk and Sinsaenghwal), a commemorative photograph was taken. Following a congratulatory speech by Mr. Kim Kiho, the tournament concluded successfully amidst great enthusiasm.

Lastly, we offer our thanks to the elders who worked hard in various ways for our Tennis Tournament.

**Summary**

This 1923 article reports on the 3rd Kaesŏng Tennis Tournament, hosted by local branches of the Kaebyŏk and Sinsaenghwal magazines and sponsored by the Tonga Ilbo. The event drew huge crowds over two days (likely May 11-12, despite a mention of January 11th). Fifteen teams competed, with intense matches featuring local favorites Songdo High School (松高), a Kaesŏng team nicknamed the "Pockmarked Team" (곰보組), and the visiting Hwimun School (徽文) team from Seoul. Despite strong local support and expectations, both Songdo High teams were eliminated, much to the crowd's disappointment. The final saw the Hwimun pair (Kim Myŏnghwan, Son Hŭngyun) defeat the Kaesŏng "Pockmarked" team (Kim Hŭnggil, Kim Hŭngsun) to win the championship flag permanently, which Songdo High had won twice before. The article highlights the large scale of the event, the passionate spectators, and the intense inter-school rivalries. For historians, the article reveals the significant role of sporting events in fostering local and institutional pride (Kaesŏng vs. Seoul, Songdo vs. Hwimun) during the colonial period, the involvement of major publications in organizing such events, and the social atmosphere surrounding public gatherings in the early 1920s. The passionate local support for Songdo High and the detailed reporting on specific matches offer a glimpse into popular culture and community engagement at the time.
