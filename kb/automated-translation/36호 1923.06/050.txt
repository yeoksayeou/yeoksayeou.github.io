The Actual Situation of 6,000 Compatriots Living in Hawaii
						An Investigation by One Reporter

The situation of our compatriots in Hawaii is something that our brothers residing outside of the Korean mainland or the American continent always wish to hear about. Furthermore, as news of a group of Hawaiian compatriots visiting the homeland has recently spread, the general public is even more eager to know the circumstances there. We too regret that we do not know the situation there in detail, but first, we present a portion of an investigation based on last year's data for the reader's reference.

I. Population
The crossing of our compatriots residing in Hawaii began with the immigration in 1904, and the number of compatriots who emigrated that year was 2,435. In the following full five years, that number nearly doubled. According to the US census conducted in 1920, the number was 4,950, and by the end of June 1921, the year before last, it was estimated to be 5,327. According to the investigation during that same year, the number of births was 219, making the birth rate 41.11 [per 1000? unclear], and the number of deaths was 87, making the death rate per 10 [per 1000?] 16.33. Compared to other ethnic groups residing in that land, this is a relatively high [birth] rate, but on the other hand, it is a great regret that the death rate is unavoidably the highest. However, in recent years, the number of women crossing to America due to picture marriages has significantly increased.

II. Inviting Wives and Children
Because Hawaii was specifically excluded from the prohibition order on picture marriages and inviting women, compatriots residing there also freely have the convenience of inviting wives from their home country. Recently, the number of applications submitted to the Consulate General for certificates related to these matters has surged. According to an announcement by the local Immigration Bureau Director, in the past year up to the end of June last year, the number of compatriots who invited [spouses] or re-crossed to Hawaii was 101. Furthermore, listing the number and type of invitation certificates issued in the past four years since 1918 <32> is as follows.

[Table data missing in the provided text - Indicated by the location marker <32> and the text "擧하면 左와 如하다" meaning "is listed as follows"]

In the table above, about 85% of the invited wives were through picture marriages. The age of these invited women differed greatly from their husbands, with differences of 20 or even 30 years. Recalling the customs of just over 10 years ago when it was the norm for the man to be younger than the woman, this could be called a rapid change.
The places of origin of the invited women spanned various provinces. Among the 197 invited between 1918 and 1921, over the past four years, 148 came from Gyeongsangnam-do. Listing them by origin is as follows:
Gyeongsangnam-do 148, Gyeonggi-do 19, Gyeongsangbuk-do 9, Gangwon-do 8, Pyeongannam-do 6, Hamgyeongnam-do 3, Hwanghae-do 2, Chungcheongnam-do 1, Jeollanam-do 1
Total 197 people

IV. Living Conditions [Section III seems to be missing or incorporated elsewhere]
Compatriots who moved to Hawaii find life there easy, able to live without excessive difficulty even on an ordinary income, thus their food and clothing are abundant, and housing is generally simple and convenient.
Among the compatriots, those engaged in business and running their own stores are few; the vast majority are employed by American merchants, living on monthly salaries. The rest are all laborers. The stores currently operated independently with capital of 2,000 won or more in Honolulu and on the various islands are listed as follows: <33>

The majority of laboring compatriots are engaged in sugar cultivation. According to the investigation at the end of June the year before last, there were 1,208 people, with the breakdown as follows:

[Breakdown data missing in the provided text - Indicated by the text "其 內譯은 如左" meaning "The breakdown is as follows"]

Besides these, there are approximately 1,500 people working in pineapple cultivation, coffee cultivation, domestic service in American homes (Yard boy, Weeder, Book [Cook?]), dock labor, and other miscellaneous jobs.
The wage system for general sugar plantation laborers was revised from November of the year before last. The base monthly salary was set at 52 won for men and 39 won for women. For those working 23 days or more per month for men, and 15 days or more for women, a diligence incentive bonus (勤勞獎顧金) of 10% of their monthly earnings is given, regardless of the sugar market price. Also, a 'bonus' (『또 뽀-나쓰』(Boonas)), meaning if the standard sugar price is set at an average of 200 won per ton, at a 200 won market price, 5 pun [units, possibly cents or percentage points?] is given; above 200 won, 5 ri [smaller units] for every 2 won increase; when exceeding 200 won, for every 40 won [increase?], a profit-sharing incentive bonus (利益配當獎勵金) of 10% is to be paid.

V. Education
(a) Schools Run by Americans
As of the end of June 1921, there were <34> 233 public and private elementary schools under the jurisdiction of Hawaii County, with a total student count of 48,024. Among these, 898 were children of our ethnicity, showing a favorable situation of remarkable increase year after year. Listing the student numbers for the past four years is as follows:

[Student numbers data missing in the provided text - Indicated by the text "擧하면 如左하다" meaning "is listed as follows"]

Listing the public school enrollment as of the end of June 1920 by island: Oahu Island 298 (including Honolulu), Hawaii Island 111, Kauai Island 57, Maui Island 42, Total 508 people.
Furthermore, there are typically only 23 students in various vocational schools in the area, and about 10 more students in other public and private middle schools. The number of graduates from the University of Hawaii and middle schools last June is as follows:
University of Hawaii Graduates (Bachelor's Degree - 得業士) 1 person
McKinley High School (Middle School and above) 5 (including 1 female)
Pacific Institute (太平洋學院) 4 (including 1 female)
Iolani High School 1 person

(b) Schools Run by Compatriots
Korean language schools in Hawaii, like Japanese language schools, were placed under the management of the Hawaii County Department of Education according to the Foreign Language School Control Law passed by the temporary county assembly in November 1920. By December last year [1922], the schools that obtained permits from the Department of Education for school operation were 3 in Honolulu city, 3 on Oahu Island, 1 on Maui Island, and 2 on Hawaii Island, totaling 9 schools. There were 13 individuals who passed the teacher qualification examination and obtained teaching licenses. The total number of students across the islands was over 340. However, the numerous so-called church schools (敎會書堂) (currently Korean Christian churches using chapels concurrently as schools) that were previously scattered across various plantations were completely closed after the implementation of the new control law the year before last.
Listing the locations, teachers, and student numbers is as follows: <35>

[School data missing in the provided text - Indicated by the location marker <35> and the text "擧하면 如左하다" meaning "is listed as follows"]

VI. Religion
Among the compatriots residing in Hawaii, the only religion present is Christianity. Currently, the Methodist Church (메로듸쓰트 敎會) holds the first position with the largest number of believers. Next are the Sinripgyo (新立敎 - New Foundation Church, Yi Sŭngman's faction that separated from the Methodist Church) and the Anglican Church (聖公會派). Those belonging to the Congregational Church (組合敎會派) are very few; these are churches specifically established for Koreans. The Salvation Army (救世軍) has only one "Korean Church" (코리안-취) at the Honokaa plantation on Kauai Island. In places like Honolulu, people of various nationalities gather together in one church building. Listing the locations of each church and the names of the pastors is as follows:

[Church data missing in the provided text - Indicated by the text "列擧하면 如左" meaning "are listed as follows"]

VII. Compatriots Working in American Government Offices
Government offices where many foreigners come and go, such as the local post office and courthouse, employ interpreters for various nationalities. Currently, the 5 places where compatriots are employed and their names are listed as follows:
Honolulu Post Office (호놀눌누郵便局) Chŏng Ponggwan (鄭鳳觀)
Land Survey Bureau (土地調査局) Kim Kilsŏk (金吉石)
Honolulu City/County Police Department (호놀눌누 市郡警察署) Cho Kŭmmun (趙今文)
County First Circuit Court (縣第一巡回裁判所) Chu Myŏnggŭn (朱明根)
Immigration Bureau (臨時雇入通譯 - Temporary Hire Interpreter) Pastor Cho Pyŏng'yo (趙炳堯)

VIII. Associations, Organizations, and Their Newspapers
(1) Kyŏmindan (僑民團 - Overseas Korean Association)
The Kyŏmindan was originally called the Kukhoe (國會 - National Assembly), originating in October 1909. <36> In January 1913, it obtained recognition from the US government, reformed as an incorporated foundation (財團法人組織), and after undergoing numerous changes, it now belongs to the Yi Sŭngman faction. In March 1921, according to the Kyŏmindan Organization Ordinance promulgated by the Shanghai Provisional Government, it was renamed Kyŏmindan. Its headquarters are located in Honolulu. Min Ch'anho (閔燦鎬), a pastor of the Korean Church and Doctor of Theology, was elected as head (團長), and An Wŏn'gyu (安元奎), a businessman, as vice-head (副團長). Simultaneously, dozens of branches were established in various locations, and a vigorous membership recruitment drive resulted in obtaining about 2,000 members across the islands. However, due to the decline in Yi Sŭngman's credibility or influence, it appears somewhat stagnant afterwards.
The key officers of the Kyŏmindan are shown as follows:
Kyŏmindan Head: Min Ch'anho (閔燦鎬) (46 years old) From Yangju, Gyeonggi-do
Vice-Head: An Wŏn'gyu (安元奎) (46 years old) From Paju, Gyeonggi-do
General Secretary: An Hyŏn'gyŏng (安鉉京) (43 years old) From Gyeongseong (Seoul)
Secretary: Kim Yŏnggi (金永基) (44 years old) From Gyeongseong (Seoul)
Furthermore, the Kyŏmindan publishes the "Kungminbo" (國民報 - National Report) as its official newspaper. As it is the only Korean-language newspaper in Hawaii, it has a considerable readership. Although its management naturally faces some difficulties, it consistently continues publication twice a week without interruption. The president of the newspaper company is Min Ch'anho, and the chief editor was Yi Chong'yo (李鍾堯), but he later resigned, and Yi Wan'gyu (李完奎) became his successor.

(2) Tongniptan (獨立團 - Independence Party)
The Tongniptan originated from the split within the Kungminhoe (國民會 - National Association) due to disagreements between Pak Yongman (朴容萬) and Yi Sŭngman (李承晩) at the end of November 1918, leading to the formation of the Yŏnhaphoe (聯合會 - United Association) and the launch of its newspaper, the "T'aep'yŏngyang Sisa" (太平洋時事 - Pacific Times). In April 1921, it obtained recognition from the Governor of Hawaii County, became an incorporated body, and was renamed the Chosŏnin Tongniptan (朝鮮人獨立團 - Korean Independence Party). Its headquarters were established in Honolulu, branches were set up on various islands, and Sin Honggyun (申洪均) was elected as General Head (總團長) with Kang Yŏnghyo (姜永孝) as Vice General Head (副團長). However, Sin Honggyun resigned due to suspicion of misappropriating party funds, and Vice General Head Kang became his successor. It is said to currently have several thousand members across the islands. The key officers of the Tongniptan are shown as follows:
General Head: Kang Yŏnghyo (姜永孝) (43 years old)
General Secretary: Yi Sŏkcho (李錫祚) (43 years old)
Pacific Times President & Chief Editor: Yi Sŏkcho (李錫祚)

(3) Taehan Puin Kujehoe (大韓婦人救濟會 - Korean Women's Relief Society)
The Women's Relief Society was established with the purpose of relieving the poor and supporting the Gwangboktan (光復團 - Restoration Corps) movement. However, as it was founded without accumulating sufficient funds, it seems to face numerous difficulties in carrying out its affairs. For now, its headquarters are in Honolulu, and it has established 18 branches throughout the Hawaiian Islands, boasting about 600 members. This society can be called a type of women's independence organization. The president is the wife of Pastor Min Ch'anho of the Sinripgyo (New Foundation Church), and many of its officers are also members of the Kyŏmindan.
Furthermore, "This Women's Society sent 3,000 won during 1920 to console the families of evangelists and Christian believers imprisoned in Japanese jails since the beginning of the Korean independence movement, and 6,000 won to aid the destitute whose villages were burned down by Japanese troops in Manchuria the year before last, leaving them with nothing." The local English-language newspaper, under the headline "Korean Women Active in Relieving Distress," published a photograph of the women gathered together and praised them for this. <37>

**Summary**

This 1923 article from "Gaebyeok" magazine details the lives of approximately 6,000 Korean immigrants in Hawaii. It covers demographics (population growth, high birth/death rates, influx of picture brides mainly from Gyeongsangnam-do), living conditions (relative economic stability, employment primarily in sugar plantations and service, low business ownership), wages on plantations, education (increasing enrollment in American public schools, existence and regulation of Korean language schools), religion (dominance of Methodist Christianity, including factional splits), Korean employment in US administration (interpreters), and community organizations. It highlights the Kyŏmindan (aligned with Yi Sŭngman) and the Tongniptan (formed after a split with Yi), their leadership, newspapers (Kungminbo, T'aep'yŏngyang Sisa), and the activities of the Korean Women's Relief Society in supporting the independence movement and compatriots in need.

For historians, this article provides a valuable snapshot of the early Korean diaspora in Hawaii during the colonial period. Particularly interesting are the detailed statistics on population origins (showing Gyeongsang dominance), the phenomenon of picture brides, the specific wage structures on sugar plantations, the impact of US regulations on Korean language schools, and the clear evidence of political factionalism (Yi Sŭngman vs. Pak Yongman) extending to the diaspora community. The mention of fundraising for independence activists and victims of Japanese actions in Manchuria underscores the community's strong connection to the homeland's political struggles.

						一記者調
「하와이」에 잇는 同胞의 狀況은 朝鮮 內地 또는 米洲 以外에 外地에 잇는 兄弟의 恒時 得聞코져 하는 바이며 尙又 今回 「하와이」同胞中 一團의 故國 訪問의 消息이 傳하매 一般은 더욱이나 그곳의 事情을 알고 십허 한다. 우리 亦是 그곳의 事情을 詳知치 못함을 遺憾으로 생각하나 먼져 昨年 現在에 依한 調査의 一部를 公開하야 讀者의 叅考에 供한다.

一. 人口
布哇에 在留하는 我同胞의 渡洋은 1904年 移民時로 爲始하야 該年에 移住한 同胞數가 2,435人이엿고 其 後 滿 5個年間에는 其 數가 殆히 倍에 達하엿나니 1920年度에 行한 米國의 國勢 調査에 依하면 其 數가 4,950人이엿스며 再昨年度 卽 1921年 6月末에 至하야는 5,327人으로 推算케 되엿섯다. 그런데 同 年度中의 調査에 依하면 出生數가 219人이니 此 出生率은 41.11이오 死亡數가 87人이니 每 10人에 對한 死亡率은 16.33인대 此를 該地에 住居하는 他族에 比하면 比較的 高率이나 其 反面에 死亡率이 最高됨을 不免함이 一大遺憾히다. 그러나 近年에는 寫眞結婚으로 因하야 渡米婦女數는 顯著히 增加한다.

二. 妻子招娉
布哇는 特히 寫眞結婚 及 婦女招娉 禁止令에 除外되얏슴으로 在留同胞도 亦是 自由로 本國에 婦妻招娉의 便宜를 有케 되얏나니 近來 總領事舘에 此等의 關係 證明書下付願提出數가 激增하야 常地 移民局長의 發表한 바에 依하건대 昨年 6月末까지의 過去 1個年間에 招娉 又는 再航渡布한 同胞數가 101名이고 다시 1918年부터의 以後 過去 4個年間에 發給한 招娉證明의 件數와 種別을＜32＞ 擧하면 左와 如하다.

右表中 娉妻의 約 8割 5分은 寫眞結婚으로 되엿는데 이 招娉된 婦人의 年齡은 其 男便과 甚히 差違되야 20 或 30의 差違까지 잇섯나니 10餘年 前만 하여도 男子가 女子보다 年少됨이 常例이든 風紀를 回顧하면 可謂 急變이라고 하엿다.
招娉婦女의 原籍地는 자못 各道에 亙하야 1918年 乃至 1921年 過去 4個年間의 招娉數 197名中 148名은 慶尙南道에서 渡來하엿고 其 原籍別을 揭하면 如左하다.
