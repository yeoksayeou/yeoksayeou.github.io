Company Announcement

The articles regarding the Gyeongbuk Province Special Issue were intended to be completed in this issue, but due to page count circumstances, we unavoidably must publish them in the next issue.

Gaebyeok Company Editorial Department <63>

**Summary**

This is a brief notice from the Gaebyeok magazine's editorial department informing readers that the concluding articles for the special issue focused on Gyeongsangbuk-do (Gyeongbuk Province) could not be included in the current issue (No. 36) due to space limitations. The remaining articles will be published in the subsequent issue. For historians, this notice highlights the practical publishing constraints faced during the colonial era and the magazine's engagement with regional topics through special issues, potentially reflecting efforts to represent diverse parts of Korea under colonial rule.
