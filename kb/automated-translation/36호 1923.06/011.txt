Company Announcement

Our company's special dispatch investigators for the Kyŏngbuk trip, Ch'a Sangch'an and Yi Chaehyŏn, who departed Kyŏngsŏng at the end of last March, have now returned safely to the company at the end of this May. We thank the brothers of Kyŏngbuk who gave much support to their party during those sixty days.

Pak Talsŏng, Han Chungch'ŏn, Cho Kigan, and their party are currently in the midst of investigating the P'yŏngbuk region. After finishing that work, they will immediately begin the investigation regarding Kangwŏn Province. However, concerning Kangwŏn Province, aside from the famous scenic spots such as Kŭmgangsan (Mount Kŭmgang) and the Kwandong P'algyŏng (Eight Scenic Views of Kwandong) being renowned, almost nothing else about its circumstances has been published. Therefore, our company will likewise see this task through from beginning to end with profound attention. We ask the personages of Kangwŏn to please show special understanding regarding this point.

From Kaebyŏk Company <1>

**Summary**

The Kaebyŏk Company announces the safe return of its investigative team (Ch'a Sangch'an, Yi Chaehyŏn) from a 60-day survey of Kyŏngbuk Province, thanking locals for their support. It also reports that another team (Pak Talsŏng, Han Chungch'ŏn, Cho Kigan) is currently surveying P'yŏngbuk Province and will next investigate Kangwŏn Province. The company emphasizes the importance of the Kangwŏn survey, noting the lack of published information beyond famous tourist sites, and requests local cooperation. From a historical perspective, this announcement is interesting as it shows a Korean cultural magazine actively conducting and publicizing nation-wide surveys (踏査, t'apsa) during the Japanese colonial period. This signifies an effort to understand and represent Korea from a Korean viewpoint, potentially fostering national awareness and documenting regional realities beyond official colonial narratives or simple tourism, focusing on broader "circumstances" (事情).
