The Bandit Problem and Sun Yat-sen

According to dispatches from Guangdong, due to the recent Lincheng County Bandit Incident (臨城縣 土匪事件), the Beijing Government has increasingly lost credibility, and talk of Sun Yat-sen (孫文) becoming President, centered around Guangdong, is emerging, reportedly with British and American approval as well.

Indeed, the trend of the Chinese populace distrusting the current government, which solely relies on the power of financial cliques (chaebŏl; 財閥) and warlords (kunbŏl; 軍閥), or the magnates associated with it, has been present for some time, and in recent years it was in the process of clearly becoming reality. Thus, due to this incident, the benefits from the Washington Conference (華府會議), which had been touted as a great success for the Beijing Government over the years, have completely come to naught (水疱로 歸하고). Should the power of the Diplomatic Corps (外交團), composed of representatives from various nations, effectively demonstrate a situation of managing China, and the day comes when the credibility and authority (信威) of the current government are utterly defeated (一敗塗地), a major revolutionary movement based on the awakened populace of China might perhaps break out (勃業될지도 모르겟다). Situations can change rapidly if they are to change rapidly, so what will be the outcome of this issue going forward (借向)?<60>

**Summary**

This news article reports on the political fallout in China following the Lincheng Incident of 1923. It notes that the incident severely damaged the credibility of the Beijing government, which was already distrusted for relying on financial and military cliques. Consequently, support for Sun Yat-sen, based in Guangdong, is rising, allegedly even among the British and Americans. The article speculates that the incident nullified gains from the Washington Conference and might lead to foreign powers exerting more control or even provoke a popular revolution if the Beijing government's authority collapses completely. From the perspective of Korean colonial history, this article is interesting as it reflects Korean observation of and potential hope placed in Chinese political instability. The weakening of a major regional power's central government and the possibility of revolution in China could have been seen by Koreans under Japanese rule as potentially influencing their own situation or offering opportunities for Korean independence activists operating in China.

士匪問題와 孫文
廣東來電에 의하면 今回 臨城縣의 土匪事件으로 인하야 北京政府는 益益 失信케 된 바 廣東을 중심으로 한 孫文大統領說이 대두되며 英米人도 역시 此에 찬성한다고 전한다.
盖 中國의 민중이 재벌 군벌의 세력을 유일의 근거로 한 現政府 또는 그에 관련한 巨頭輩를 신임치 아니하는 것은 언제부터의 경향으로서 近年에 와서는 그것이 확실히 사실화하려는 중인즉 今番의 사건으로 인하야 北京政府의 年來의 대성공이라 하던 華府會議의 利得이 完然히 水疱로 歸하고 其 中 列國의 대표자로 成한 外交團의 세력이 사실상으로 中國을 管理할 형세를 示하야 現政府의 信威가 一敗塗地하는 그날에는 中國의 자각잇는 민중을 기초로 한 一大 혁명운동이 勃業될지도 모르겟다. 局面은 急轉되려면 急轉도 되는 것이라 借向이 문제의 結局이 何如.＜60＞
