Hear This, See That

What is this commotion? It appears the Korean-style buildings (朝鮮式 建物) within Seoul's Tŏksu Palace (德壽宮) are set to be completely wiped out. They are being torn down daily even now. It seems only the Stone Hall (石造殿) will remain. But what on earth are they planning to do after tearing them down? According to someone who seems knowledgeable about the situation, the plan is apparently to build the official residence of the Government-General (總督府 官舍) there. So, they build the Government-General Building (總督府 廳舍) inside Kyŏngbok Palace (景福宮), build the Government-General's residence inside Tŏksu Palace (德壽宮), establish the Government-General Middle School (總督府 中學校) inside the West Palace (西闕), and station a Vice-Minister (次官) ranking official inside Ch'angdŏk Palace (昌德宮). Well done, well done indeed.

Count Song Pyŏngjun (宋秉畯伯), who had been lying low in Tokyo (東京) for a long time, scheming various plots, returned to Kyŏngsŏng (京城) on the 22nd of last month. According to reports, the matters Count Song lobbied the authorities (當局) for during his trip to Tokyo were: (1) Internal autonomy for Korea (朝鮮의 內政獨立), (2) Appointment of a Korean as Vice Governor-General (政務總監), (3) Leasing (借入) land near Tsushima (對馬) to be used as a residential area for Korean laborers (朝鮮人 勞働者), and several other items. It is said that permission was obtained from the government (政府) for the Tsushima land lease. Does this mean he sold out the issue of "Korea's internal autonomy" to achieve the Tsushima land lease? Such a demand could surely have been met even without him disguising himself (粉裝) as a great statesman discussing the Korean independence issue. In any case (如何間), obtaining anything is impressive (壯하나), but isn't it a worry that the things left to sell off are gradually diminishing (젹어저서)? Who knows? What issue will he fabricate (做出) this time to use as leverage for acquiring concessions (利權獲得)?

Korea's enthusiasm for sports (運動熱) seems quite intense (激甚), judging by the frequency of athletic meets (運動會 開催) held within the year. In Kyŏngsŏng, an organization called the Korean Sports Association (朝鮮體育協會) exists, at least nominally, guiding the entire sports world of Korea (全 朝鮮). However, one thing that must be noted in the Kyŏngsŏng sports scene is the disagreement (意見不合) between the athletes (運動軍) and the referees (審判員). Of course, strictly speaking (嚴格히), athletes and referees are not entirely separate groups, but the current situation (現狀) in Kyŏngsŏng seems to have naturally become so. During the recent All-Korea Baseball Tournament (全鮮野球大會), there was an incident where chief umpire Yun Ch'iyŏng (尹致暎) ordered Pak Sŏgyun (朴錫胤) and one other person to leave the field. While this can be considered a temporary measure (臨時의 處置) based on the specific circumstances (境遇) at that time, at least in the eyes (眼目) of a third party (第3者), it appeared to be the result of an outbreak (發作) stemming from underlying remote and immediate causes (遠因 近因). As soon as that tournament ended (끗나자마자), a Baseball Referees Association (野球審判會) was organized (組織되엿다), centered around Yun Ch'iyŏng and several others (幾人). This gives an even more concrete (具體) feeling to the existing confrontation (對立) between the two sides (兩者間). There is no need for a long story (이약이), but strife (鬪格) must not arise in our sports world, which is just now beginning to develop. It is said that mutual consideration (考慮) and general public attention (一般으로 注視) are necessary (必要).<58>

**Summary**

This article comments on three current events in colonial Korea. First, it laments the ongoing destruction of traditional Korean buildings in Tŏksu Palace to potentially build a residence for the Japanese Government-General, noting this as another instance of colonial repurposing of royal palaces. Second, it critically reports on the return of the pro-Japanese Count Song Pyŏngjun from Tokyo, suggesting his lobbying efforts for minor concessions like land for laborers in Tsushima came at the expense of feigning interest in Korean autonomy, purely for personal gain. Third, it discusses the burgeoning sports scene, particularly baseball, but highlights growing tensions and conflict between athletes and referees in Kyŏngsŏng, exemplified by a recent ejection incident and the subsequent formation of a separate referees' association, urging unity in the developing sports community.

From a historical perspective, the article provides a contemporary critical view of Japanese colonial policies impacting Korean cultural heritage (palace destruction) and political maneuvering by pro-Japanese Korean figures like Song Pyŏngjun. It also offers insight into the social dynamics of the early Korean sports movement, showing both its growing popularity and internal conflicts under the surface, reflecting perhaps broader societal tensions. Historians might find the candid criticism of colonial actions and collaborators, alongside the commentary on social developments like sports, particularly valuable.

隨聞隨見
무슨 쑹수인지 서울 德壽宮안의 朝鮮式 建物은 一網打盡으로 撤毁될 貌樣이다. 只今도 날마다 허러 내인다. 다못 石造殿 하나만 남을 貌樣이다. 그런대 그것을 허러내고 大體 무엇을 할 터인가. 그 便의 消息을 아는 듯한 사람의 말에 依하면 거긔에 總督府 官舍를 지을 작졍이라고. 그래 景福宮 안에 總督府 廳舍를 짓고 德壽宮 안에 總督府 官舍를 짓고 西闕안에 總督府 中學校를 세우고 昌德宮 안에 次官인 長官을 두고 잘 한다 잘 한다.

오래동안 東京에 伏在하야 꾸물꾸물하며 가진 陰謀를 꾸미며 잇던 宋秉畯伯도 지난 22日에 歸京하엿는데 傳하는 바에 依하면 宋伯이 이번에 東京가서 當局을 對해서 運動한 것은 (一) 朝鮮의 內政獨立 (二) 政務總監을 朝鮮人으로 任할 것 (三) 對馬附近에 土地를 借入하야 朝鮮人 勞働者의 居住地로 할 것 其 外 數件인데 對馬의 土地借入의 件은 政府로부터 許可를 어덧다는 말이다. 그러면 「朝鮮의 內政獨立」이란 問題를 파라 對馬의 土地借入을 行함인가. 그만한 要求이면 朝鮮의 獨立問題를 云爲하는 大政治家로 粉裝까지 아니할지라도 될 일이 아닌가. 如何間 아모 것이라도 어든 것은 壯하나 차차 파라먹을 것이 젹어저서 걱졍이 아닌가. 모르괘라 이번에는 또 무슨 問題를 做出하야 利權獲得의 資力을 삼을고.

朝鮮의 運動熱은 年內의 運動會 開催의 頻煩과 其히 자못 激甚한 樣이다. 京城에는 朝鮮體育協會라는 것이 名義上으로라도 每樣 全 朝鮮의 運動界를 指導하며 잇다. 그런데 京城의 運動界에 잇서 한 가지 注意하지 아느면 안 될 것은 運動軍 對 審判員間의 意見不合이다. 勿論 嚴格히 말하면 運動軍과 審判者가 아조 따로 잇는 것이 아닐지나 現下의 京城 現狀은 스스로 그러케 된 것 갓다. 今回의 全鮮野球大會時에 尹致暎 主審으로부터 朴錫胤氏 外 1人에 對한 退場을 命한 일이 잇섯나니 이것은 勿論 그 때의 그 境遇에 依한 臨時의 處置라 할 것이지마는 적어도 第3者의 眼目에는 그것이다.- 遠因 近因의 發作밋헤서 그리 된 것으로 보엿다. 그 大會가 끗나자마자 곳 野球審判會라는 것이 尹致暎氏 外 幾人을 一團으로 하야 組織되엿다. 이것은 더욱이나 在來의 兩者間 對立을 一層 具體한 感이 잇다. 긴 이약이를 할 것 업거니와 이제 겨우 일어나는 우리의 運動界에 잇서 鬪格이 생겨서는 안 된다. 서로 考慮하고 一般으로 注視할 必要가 잇다 한다.＜58＞
