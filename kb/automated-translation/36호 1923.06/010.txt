Ah! What words would be good to say? When we think back to the circumstances at the time when we published the inaugural issue of "Kaebyŏk" (開闢) and faced confiscation after confiscation, not knowing what to do, it seems just like yesterday. Yet, in the meantime, a full year, then two years, then three years have passed, and on July 1st, we will greet the 3rd anniversary of this magazine's founding.

Amidst limitless emotion, we are now planning the publication of a grand commemorative special issue for the 1st of next month. We announce a part of this plan (as noted below) and pledge to cooperate with our esteemed readers (愛讀諸賢) to bring it to fruition.

As Noted Below:
One: Critiques regarding the current Cultural Movement and Social Movement
Two: Critiques regarding the various newspapers and magazines published within the borders of Korea (朝鮮境內)

First, we earnestly hope for submissions (投稿) of truthful, bold critical essays (批判文) regarding the two categories noted above (within 300 lines, 23 characters per line), and also, centered on current social issues:
Three: Submissions of short stories (短篇小說) (within 400 lines, 23 characters per line) and impression pieces (感想文) (within 200 lines, 23 characters per line). Although it is but a humble token of our sincerity (微誠), we will present a modest honorarium (薄謝) to those esteemed readers (讀賢) whose manuscripts we publish. (Please ensure all types of submissions arrive at our company by June 15th.)

Seeking Submissions of Rigorous Critical Essays on the Cultural Movement

**Summary**

This article is an announcement from the editors of the Korean magazine *Kaebyŏk* (開闢) regarding the upcoming publication of a special issue commemorating its third anniversary on July 1, 1923. The editors reflect on the difficulties faced since the magazine's founding, particularly repeated confiscations by authorities. They invite readers to submit critical essays on the contemporary cultural and social movements in Korea, critiques of other newspapers and magazines published in Korea, as well as short stories and impression pieces focused on social issues. Submission guidelines (length limits) and a deadline (June 15th) are provided, along with the promise of a modest payment for published works. For historians, this piece is interesting as it directly references the censorship ("confiscation") faced by Korean publications under Japanese colonial rule. It also highlights the key intellectual concerns of the time – the "Cultural Movement" (Munhwa Undong) and "Social Movement" (Sahoe Undong) – and the magazine's active role in fostering critical public discourse on these topics and the state of Korean media itself.
