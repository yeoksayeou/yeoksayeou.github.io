**Summary**

This "Social Diary" chronicles daily events from November 16 to December 15, 1925. It heavily features the escalating political and military turmoil in China, including the Fengtien Clique's internal conflict with Guo Songling, Feng Yü-hsiang's coup in Beijing, the ongoing Tariff Conference, and Japanese intervention in Manchuria. Significant events in Korea include the arrest and prosecution of numerous socialists, communists, and anarchists (like Pak Yŏl, Im Wŏn-gŭn, Kim Yak-su), major labor strikes (Pusan printers, Mokp'o laborers), tenant farmer protests (Naju), the death of the Vice Governor-General and appointment of his successor, and the formation of various youth alliances. International news covers the death of the British Queen Mother, the Locarno Pact signing, French cabinet changes, and US discussions on recognizing Soviet Russia. For historians, this article offers a valuable contemporary snapshot of the volatile situation in East Asia, detailing the interplay between Chinese warlord politics, Japanese expansionism, the rise of communist/socialist movements in Korea under colonial rule, and related labor/agrarian unrest. The specific names, dates, and locations related to arrests and political organizing in Korea provide granular detail on colonial suppression and resistance activities.
