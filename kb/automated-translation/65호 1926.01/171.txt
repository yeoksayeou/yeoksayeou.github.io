Six Aspects of the Mountain Lord (山君), a World-Famous Creature
						By Ch'ŏngo (靑吾)

People of the North sing of the White Bear (白態), people of China praise the Yellow Dragon (黃龍), people of India worship the snake and elephant, people of Arabia boast of the camel, people of Africa fear the lion, and the people of Yamato (大和)忌諱 the fox. Because our Chosŏn (朝鮮) is a mountain country, there are particularly many stories about tigers. Whether in legends, proverbs, or other forms like poetry, folk songs, customs, superstitions, etc., there is no place they do not appear. From the myths of the ancient Tan'gun (檀君) era to the miscellaneous talk circulating in the streets today, one could say there's almost nothing left to talk about without mentioning tigers. Even when children cry, saying "Ebi! The tiger is coming!" makes them stop crying. This is true in Kyŏngsŏng (京城) and in the provinces. Among them, Hamgyŏng (咸鏡) and Kangwŏn (江原) provinces are mountain countries within a mountain country, and great tiger countries within a tiger country. Especially since I grew up in that great tiger country of Kwandong (關東), I heard many stories about tigers from a young age and found them interesting. Taking the opportunity afforded by my illness this year, I intend to briefly introduce these tiger stories here.

One, The Tiger's Position in Zoology
The tiger belongs to the Carnivora class of vertebrate animals. Its physical strength is immense, and its nature is ferocious, cruel, fierce, and violent, capable of biting and eating humans and livestock. The structure of its body is entirely adapted to its way of life. Its claws are extremely sharp, its canine teeth are developed and particularly strong, and its molars, not forming a grinding surface (臼形), have sharp edges (尖銳) suitable for tearing flesh and crushing bones. Its appearance resembles a cat but it is larger, typically reaching five or six *ch'ŏk* (尺) [approx. 150-180 cm] in length. Its fur color is generally a vivid yellow with black stripes. Along with the lion, it is a representative fierce beast among carnivorous animals. Its habitats include Chosŏn, China, India, Africa, etc., but among these, the Chosŏn tiger has long been famous worldwide for its large body and fine fur.

Two, The Tiger in Chosŏn's Language and Songs
○ The tiger's nicknames include San'gun (山君 - Mountain Lord) or Sanjung Yŏng'ung (山中英雄 - Hero of the Mountains). A small tiger is called "kamkaji" (감가지) or "kaehoju" (개호주). The tiger is also generally called "pŏm" (범) or "horangi" (호랑이). Based on its stripes, it is also called *ch'ikpŏn* (칙번).

Three, Superstitions and Folk Legends Regarding Tigers
○ The *Tan'gun Kogi* (檀君古紀) states that a bear and a tiger lived together in a cave. They constantly prayed to the Heavenly King Hwanung (天王桓雄) to become human. Ung (雄) gave them a bundle of mugwort (艾) and twenty cloves of garlic (蒜). The tiger ate them but could not transform. The bear ate them and after three times seven days (三七日), transformed into a woman. This is Ungnyŏ (熊女), also called Sinhungssi (神熊氏).
○ The *Samguk Yusa* (三國遺事) says that during the reign of King Wŏnsŏng (元聖王) of Silla (新羅), Kim Hyŏn (金現) married a female tiger. When the tiger died, Hyŏn built Howŏn Temple (虎願寺) to pray for the repose of the tiger-woman's soul and also named the forest Horim (虎林).
○ Nangnang (樂浪) sent a tiger to Emperor Wu of Wei (魏武帝); its patterns were like brocade (錦斑). (*Shíyí Jì* - 拾遺記)
○ Covering a new bride's palanquin (驕子) with tiger skin prevents evil spirits (惡鬼) from attaching themselves.
○ Boiling and consuming tiger shinbones (虎脛骨) is highly effective for nervous disorders. This seems more like experience than superstition.
○ Tigers do not see paper (虎不見紙). [Meaning tigers are unaware of written rules/authority?]
○ If a tiger eats a thousand people, it transforms into a monk (僧). Each time it eats one person, one of its ears tears.
○ If a tiger eats a chicken (鷄), its teeth fall out. Therefore, applying chicken meat to a tiger wound is immediately effective.
○ When traveling at night, carrying fire (火) makes tigers fearful (畏㥘).
○ If you go into the mountains and say you want to drink water (水), a tiger will make the sound of water, deceive you, and then bite and eat you.
○ When walking at night, if a tiger follows you, if you stop at a house and announce that a guest (客) has arrived, it will surely harm the people or livestock of that house, but it will stop following you.
○ Using a tiger skull (虎頭骨) as a pillow prevents nightmares (惡夢).
○ The bones and flesh of a person killed by a tiger must be cremated (火葬). Also, on the anniversary of that person's death, if a table of sacrificial food (祭物) is set up outside the gate, the tiger will come and eat it.
○ If an old person wears a tiger claw (虎爪), they can avoid disaster (災難). If a child wears a tiger claw, they will not contract smallpox (天然痘).
○ Pasting a tiger painting (虎畵) on the main gate or room door prevents evil spirits from entering the house.
○ If one sees a tiger in a dream (夢) and then has marital relations, they will give birth to a son who will become a military official (武官) in the future. Another interpretation says that seeing a tiger in a dream means the tiger (虎) transforms into the character for "good" (好), and all affairs will turn out well.
○ It is said that when a tiger intends to harm a person, it must first obtain permission from the mountain god (山神). At that time, the person appears as a dog (犬) or pig (豕) to the tiger.
○ Since tigers do not eat drunk people (誶한 人), they invariably dip their tail in water, sprinkle it on the person's face to wake them up, and then bite and eat them. Also, they do not eat virtuous people (善行者) or sleeping people (寢人).
○ When a tiger eats a person or animal, it does not eat what falls to its left side. (The proverb "Even if a tiger is about to bite you, if you keep your wits about you, you can survive" comes from this.)
○ Tigers mate only on extremely cold *Najŏng* days (臘亭日 - days around the winter solstice). Therefore, if the weather on *Najŏng* days is mild, tigers cannot reproduce that year.
○ If you say you have never seen a tiger, a tiger will appear immediately. (This corresponds to the proverb "Even the tiger comes if you talk about it.")
○ If the mountain god ritual (山神祭) is performed improperly (不潔), tigers will harm people and livestock.
○ When a tiger wants to "think about" a person, if it licks the foundation stones of that person's outhouse (便所), that person naturally feels the urge to go to the outhouse <108> and gets eaten by the tiger.
○ There is a saying that if a person in Kangwŏn Province (江原道) has three sons (三子), they give one son to the tiger, one son to become a monk (僧), and raise one son themselves. (Said because there are many tigers in Kangwŏn Province).

Four, Historical Figures and Tigers
○ Kangsu (强首), a Silla (新羅) scholar, had a raised bone on the back of his head shaped like a crouching tiger (伏虎).
○ When Kyŏn Hwŏn (甄萱), founder of Later Paekche (後百濟), was young, his mother left him under a tree while taking food (饁) to his father Yi Aja'gae (李阿慈介), a farmer (農夫). A tiger came and nursed him.
○ Ha Kyŏngbok (河敬復), Duke Kangjang (剛莊公) during the reign of King T'aejong (太宗) of the Yi Dynasty (李朝), possessed superhuman strength (賀力). When young, while hunting deep in the mountains, he encountered a fierce tiger. They fought, and Kyŏngbok grabbed the tiger's chin flesh (頷肉), wrestled it to the ground (躑躅), saw a deep pond below a cliff (崖下), and threw it in. The tiger drank water, its belly became bloated (脹), and he subsequently captured and killed it.
○ Ch'oe Yundŏk (崔潤德), the renowned General Chŏngnyŏl (貞烈公) from T'ongch'ŏn (通川), Kangwŏn Province, during King Sejong's (世宗) reign, was serving as the magistrate (牧使) of Anju (安州). A village woman tearfully reported that her husband had been harmed by a tiger. The Duke readily promised to avenge him, immediately followed the tracks, shot the tiger dead, cut open its belly, retrieved the victim's bones and body parts, wrapped them in clothes, prepared a coffin, and gave him a proper burial (厚葬). The entire county was moved to tears.
○ Kim Chong-sŏ (金宗瑞), Duke Chŏlje (節齊), a famous minister during King Munjong's (文宗) reign, was known for his wisdom and courage (智謀膽略). Together with Chief State Councilor T'ak Poin (政丞卓甫仁), he received the dying king's entrustment (顧命之托) and assisted the young King Tanjong (端宗). People called him the Great Tiger (大虎).
○ Yi Ching-ok (李澄玉), a military commander (節度使) during King Sejong's reign (who later proclaimed himself Emperor of Great Jin - 大金皇帝), possessed unmatched bravery (萬夫不當之勇) from childhood. He loved to shoot fierce tigers daily. Whenever he shot, he would first open his eyes wide and shout loudly (大聲叱呼). The tiger, unable to resist, would close its eyes (合眠), lower its head (低首), and submit, falling instantly to a single shot. One day, he went to Kimhae (金海) and requested an audience with the magistrate (府使). The magistrate declined to see him. Returning empty-handed, on the way, he saw a young woman weeping bitterly. When asked, she said her husband had been taken by a tiger and was currently in the nearby bamboo forest (竹林). Hearing this, Ching-ok became furious, rolled up his sleeves (臂を攘し), entered the bamboo forest, choked the tiger out (扼出), drew his sword (鈑), and cut open its flesh. The human flesh was not yet digested, so he took it out, had the wife wrap it for burial (褁葬), skinned the tiger, gave the pelt to the wife, and told her to inform the magistrate. The magistrate was greatly astonished, sent someone to apologize for his fault, and requested to see him again, but Ching-ok ignored him and left.
○ Yu Ch'adal (柳車達), the Great Prime Minister (大承相) of Koryŏ (高麗), had two sons: the elder, Ch'a Hyojŏn (車孝全), Lord of Yŏnan (延安君) (ancestor of the Ch'a clan - 車氏祖先), and the younger, Yu Hyogim (柳孝金), Lord of Munhwa (文化君) (founder of the Yu clan - 柳氏始祖). The brothers went to Kuwŏl Mountain (九月山) in Munhwa to find a burial site (葬地) for their late father. They encountered a tiger and removed a silver hairpin (銀釵) stuck in its mouth. That night, the tiger appeared in a dream, saying, "I am originally the mountain spirit (山精) of Kuwŏl Mountain. Last night, I bit and ate the daughter of a certain Mr. Kim from Sŏngdang-ni (聖堂里) in Chaeryŏng county (載寧郡). The silver hairpin got stuck in my mouth, and I was near death. You gentlemen, without aversion, removed it and saved my life. Your kindness is immense." It then said, "If you choose the burial site for your father at location X, your descendants will greatly prosper (大昌)." The brothers found this very strange. They personally went to Chaeryŏng to inquire and found that, indeed, three days earlier, a tiger had seized a girl wearing a silver hairpin. Thinking it even more wondrous, they sought out the burial site. This is the tomb of Prime Minister Ch'a, located in Mukpang-dong (墨方洞) on Kuwŏl Mountain, known as the auspicious site chosen by the tiger (虎占名蕩). (*Yŏji Sŭngnam* - 與地勝覽 and records of the Ch'a and Yu families - 車柳兩姓請)
○ Kim Tŏngnyŏng (金德齡), Duke Chungjang (忠莊公) during the reign of King Sŏnjo (宣朝) of the Yi Dynasty, possessed god-like courage (神勇). Yi Kwi (李貴) praised him, saying he could chase dragons and tigers, flying through the air (捕逐龍虎에 飛走空中). King Kwanghaegun (光海君) bestowed upon him the title Ikho Changgun (翼虎將軍 - Winged Tiger General).
○ During the Imjin War (壬辰亂) under King Sŏnjo, Che Mal (諸沫), Duke Chungjang (忠壯公), fought Japanese soldiers (日兵). His courage was imposing (軒軒), and his beard and hair stood on end like hedgehog quills (蝟毛). The Japanese soldiers all feared him, called him the Tiger General (虎將軍), and warned each other wherever he appeared.

**Summary**

This article meticulously explores the multifaceted significance of the tiger (山君, San'gun) in Korean culture, drawing parallels with symbolic animals in other nations. It covers the tiger's zoological status, its prominent role in Korean language (proverbs, names), folk songs, superstitions (like the Tan'gun myth origin story, beliefs about tiger behavior, ghosts, and protective charms), historical anecdotes involving famous figures interacting with tigers (from Silla's Kim Hyŏn to Yi Dynasty generals like Ch'oe Yundŏk and Kim Tŏngnyŏng), tiger-related place names across Korea, and numerous references to tigers in classical Chinese literature. The author, writing from personal interest rooted in his upbringing in the "tiger country" of Kangwŏn Province, presents a comprehensive catalog of the tiger's cultural footprint. From a colonial history perspective, the article is interesting for its strong emphasis on uniquely Korean folklore, history, and geography centered around the tiger, implicitly asserting Korean cultural identity during Japanese rule. The detailed compilation itself, preserving these native narratives and linguistic elements, can be seen as an act of cultural preservation and subtle resistance against assimilation pressures, making it a valuable resource for historians studying cultural nationalism in colonial Korea.
