I. Preface
This year is Pyŏngin (丙寅). Pyŏngin is a year that leaves the deepest impression and evokes much emotion for us Koreans. In the 4,252 years since the dawn of history, among the 71 Pyŏngin years (including this year), important pages of history have mostly been filled with the bloodshed and storms of war. For example, in the 20th year of King Tongch'ŏn of Koguryŏ, Pyŏngin (Tan'gi 2579), Kuan Ch'iu-chien (毋丘儉) of Wei invaded the capital Kuktŏ-sŏng, forcing the king to temporarily flee to South Okchŏ before repelling them. In the 8th year of King Soji of Silla, Pyŏngin (2819), Japanese pirates invaded the border regions but were defeated and retreated. Later, in the 25th year of King Pojang of Koguryŏ, Pyŏngin (2999), the famous *Makniji* (莫支離) Yŏn Kaesomun passed away, and taking advantage of the opportunity created by the conflict among his three sons, Namsaeng, Namgŏn, and Namsan, Li Chi (李勣) of Tang invaded. In the 11th year of Yŏnsan of the Yi Dynasty, Pyŏngin (3839), a revolutionary turmoil for the throne arose, the tyrant Yŏnsan was deposed, and Chungjong succeeded to the throne. Also, in the 3rd year of the reign of the late Emperor Yi [King Kojong], Pyŏngin (4199), the Western Disturbances (洋擾), known to everyone, occurred. However, while the other various wars, even if great, were merely wars between fellow Asian peoples,<60> this Pyŏngin Yangyo marked the first time that the "Land of the Eastern Gentlemen" exchanged fire with white people of so-called "blue eyes and curly beards" (碧紫眼髥). Of course, this disturbance was not originally a war initiated internationally with France itself, nor was it a war spanning a long period; it was merely a temporary clash, a disturbance like a "fight between snails on their horns" (蝸角之爭). Yet, its impact, widely proclaimed to the world and spreading to politics and thought in modern Korea, was truly immense. The victory drums of Kanghwado Island momentarily further spurred the Taewŏn'gun's ideology of "repelling barbarians" (攘夷) and his isolationist policy (鎖國主義), but on the other hand, they became the signal drum heralding Korea's opening to the world in the not-too-distant future. International treaties of friendship were also its reverberation, and the freedom of thought among the people also began to sprout thereafter. Sixty years have passed since the disturbance, and thinking of the old days today, who can suppress the feeling of profound change (滄桑之感)? Now, as we greet Pyŏngin, I wish to recall the Western Disturbances once more and briefly discuss the historical facts of that time.

II. The Political Situation in Korea Before the Western Disturbances
The political situation in Korea before the Western Disturbances was indeed eventful and complex. During King Ch'ŏljong's 14-year reign, the arrogance of the royal in-laws (外戚) and the friction between political factions (朋黨) reached extremes, and state affairs deteriorated daily, yet he could not rectify the situation. When he passed away in Kyehae (1863) without an heir, the second son of Prince Hŭngsŏn, the later Emperor Kojong, ascended the throne at the young age of 12, and the Taewŏn'gun (大院君) became regent. Thus, the political power of Korea, which had been held by the Kim clan of royal in-laws, returned to the hands of the Taewŏn'gun. The Taewŏn'gun moved to restore the authority of the royal family, control the tyranny of the aristocracy, and suppress the power of the royal in-laws. First, he boldly carried out the dismissal and appointment of high officials: Cho Tusun became Chief State Councilor, Kim Pyŏnghak became Right State Councilor; Yi Ŭiik, Chŏng Kise, and Kim Se'gyun became Ministers of Personnel, War, and Taxation respectively; Yi Sŭngbo became *Ŭihye Tangsang*; Yi Kyŏngha became Training Commander and concurrently Left Police Chief; Yi Changnyŏm became Commander of the Royal Guard; Yi Kyŏng'u became Commander of the Capital Garrison; Yi Panghyŏn became *Ch'onggye Sa*; Sin Myŏngsun became Right Police Chief. He also rebuilt Kyŏngbok Palace (Ŭlch'uk, 1865), greatly changed the system by abolishing the Border Defense Council (備邊司) and establishing the Three Armies Command (三軍府), having incumbent generals and ministers hold concurrent positions. He elevated Kanghwa Prefecture (江華府) to Chinmu Garrison (鎭撫營), recruited brave soldiers called *Pyŏlch'osa* (別驍士) assigned to that garrison, established four counties including Musan and Huju in North Hamgyŏng Province for settlement and reclamation, and prohibited military officials from riding palanquins, making them ride horses for public and private outings. Furthermore, he sought horses from Manchuria, making wealthy citizens raise one or two each, and abolished the private academies (書院) while simultaneously abolishing the law exempting descendants of loyal subjects from cloth tax (免布法). Although there were some who expressed discontent and dissatisfaction, his strong, courageous, decisive, and fierce bearing could intimidate the four neighbors and subdue the myriad populace.<61> The rivers and mountains of the peninsula seemed to become the Taewŏn'gun's domain, and the royal authority of the Yi clan, which had declined and languished during the reigns of Sunjo and Ch'ŏljong, was restored to heights of a thousand, ten thousand *chang*, allowing one to glimpse the dawn of revitalization (中興).

III. The Arrival of Russian Ships at Wŏnsan and the Secret Maneuvers of the Catholics
Prior to this, in the 6th year of Hŏnjong, Kyŏngja (1840), French missionaries, traveling from Chihfu (芝罘) in Shandong Province, China, aboard Qing merchant ships, secretly entered the southern regions of Korea and actively proselytized (Catholicism's entry into the country, of course, predates this). By the time of King Ch'ŏljong's reign, their followers numbered in the tens of thousands. Missionaries like "Taveluy" (따뿔에루이 - Bishop Antoine Daveluy) even gained access to the royal palace. Furthermore, the wet nurse of the later Emperor [Kojong], Mistress Pak, and officials like Secretary Nam Chongsam, Hong Pongju, and Yi Sin'gwi embraced Catholicism, and its spread grew daily like a prairie fire. Later, in the 1st month of Kapcha (1864), a Russian warship arrived at Wŏnsan, delivered a letter to the government, and requested trade relations. The Taewŏn'gun resolutely refused and, worried about a Russian attack, greatly strengthened military preparations. He dispatched envoys to Japan to purchase firearms, swords, spears, etc., repaired the fortifications of Kanghwa, the mountain fortress of Munsu, and the batteries of Yŏngjong and Inch'ŏn, strengthening the defenses of Namyang Bay. He renovated the walls of Hansŏng (Seoul) and cast cannons, focusing entirely on defending against foreign invasion. Seizing this opportunity, Nam Chongsam and others sought to gain official recognition for Catholicism. After conspiring with Nam Sanggyo, they proposed to the Taewŏn'gun, saying, "Now that Russia is invading our northern border and has ambitions to advance south, the best way to defend against this is to establish friendly relations with France, the strongest nation under heaven, and borrow its strength. To arrange this, it is best to engage the French missionaries." The Taewŏn'gun, knowing their intent, feigned agreement and secretly sent his confidants to investigate the inner situation. Discovering that a French missionary named Chang Kyŏngil (張敬一 - likely Father Simon Berneux) was hiding in Nam Chongsam's house, he became enraged, resolved to revive the old laws prohibiting Western Learning (西敎), and even refused audiences with the French missionaries "Taveluy" (따뿔에루이) and "Berneux" (뻐루누 - Simon Berneux), who were traveling at the time.

IV. The Great Massacre of Catholics and the First French Naval Incursion
Before long, the Russian ships departed without incident, and anti-Catholic sentiment boiled further within the country. The Taewŏn'gun, unleashing his long-held animosity towards Catholicism, with the force of a fierce wind and savage tiger, suddenly issued strict orders to the Left Police Bureau (左捕廳) on the 20th day of the 2nd month of Pyŏngin (1866) to suppress the Catholics. Under the cover of a silent dark night, the residences of Nam Chongsam, Nam Sanggyo, Yi Sin'gwi, Hong Pongju, and others were surrounded, and besides their families, several dozen people including the Frenchman Chang Kyŏngil were captured in one sweep<62> and imprisoned in the Police Bureau, then swiftly executed. Furthermore, he had the then Training Commander Yi Kyŏngha lead the Three Armies to conduct a major search within and outside the city walls. Tens of thousands of Catholic believers (of course, many unrelated individuals were also included) were rounded up like flocks of sheep. Over three days, from the 21st to the 23rd, they were beaten to death, shot, buried alive, or beheaded. The sorrowful cries and anguish of men, women, old, and young pierced the heavens, and the land of Hansŏng instantly turned into a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood. Alas! That human heartlessness reached such an extreme! Thinking of the tragic and horrific events of that time, even today, how can one not shudder and feel one's hair stand on end? The Taewŏn'gun not only massacred the Catholics in Hansŏng but also issued strict orders to every province and county to enact the same tragedy. He also imprisoned nine French missionaries, including "Berneux" (페루누) and "Taveluy" (따블에루이), and on the 8th day of the 3rd month, brought them all out to the execution ground. Four hundred soldiers formed a crescent-shaped line, and the missionaries were stripped naked and beheaded. Additionally, a further search throughout the country led to the beheading of five more missionary priests (弘法師). The remaining three priests escaped into the mountains, barely preserving their lives. One of them, "Ridel" (리데루 - Father Félix-Claire Ridel), fled his refuge and, from Naep'o in Ch'ungch'ŏng Province, boarded an English ship. Via Chihfu in Qing China, he reported the emergency to the then French Naval Commander in Tientsin, Admiral "Roze" (로-제 - Pierre-Gustave Roze). Although Roze sympathized greatly, France happened to be occupied with affairs in Cochinchina and China, lacking the spare capacity to immediately dispatch a fleet to Korea. Thus, time dragged on until early in the 9th month of the same year. Under orders from the acting chargé d'affaires stationed in Qing, "Bellonet" (페로네), Roze took command of the aviso *Déroulède* (데루레데 號), the corvette *Primauguet* (뿌리모계 號), and the gunboat *Tardif* (다루지소 號), which had arrived in Chihfu. Accompanied by missionary Ridel and three Korean sailors who had come with him, he departed Chihfu on September 18th, anchoring at "Île Boisée" (뽀아세 島 - Jakyak Island near Inch'ŏn) on the evening of the 20th. On the 21st, the Admiral, seeking to find the route into the capital city (Kyŏngsŏng - Seoul), first dispatched the aviso *Déroulède*, using interpreter Ridel and the three sailors as guides. This aviso secretly entered the Kanghwa Strait, anchored at Kapsan Naru (甲串津), scouted the route and defensive preparations, and reported back to the Admiral. The Admiral then decided to sail up the Han River (漢江) to strike directly at the capital and dispatched three ships. However, the *Primauguet* struck a submerged rock en route and was damaged, unable to proceed. The Admiral, therefore, led only two ships up the Han River, anchoring at Yanghwajin (楊花鎭) on the evening of the 25th. He intended to attack the capital but, learning that its defenses were strong, dared not approach. After exchanging cannon fire several times with the coastal defense troops, he realized his forces were too few to prevail. He stayed for only one day, surveying the water depth and terrain difficulty, then sailed back down the Han River, returning to his original anchorage at Kanghwa. On September 30th, he retreated again to Chihfu. This was the first French naval incursion. <63>

V. The Second French Naval Incursion and the Great Victory of the Korean Army
However, this first French incursion was originally weak in military strength, unable to risk battle with our forces, and merely retreated after scouting Korea's defenses and the difficulty of its roads, mountains, and rivers as preparation for a later return. But the Koreans, momentarily spirited, believed the "Western thieves" (洋賊) were not worth contending with and persecuted Catholics even more severely. On the other hand, they repaired weapons and fortifications in preparation for any eventuality, filling the land with the spirit of "repel barbarians, reject peace" (攘夷斥和). The French Naval Admiral Roze, resentful of the failure of the first expedition, planned a retaliatory attack. On October 11th, he organized a fleet of seven large and small warships, embarked 600 marines who had arrived from Yokohama, Japan, and departed Chihfu, arriving at Île Boisée (뽀아세 島) on the [October] 30th [Likely means October 13th based on departure date Oct 11th, arriving 30th seems too long, maybe 13th? Text says 30일]. The Taewŏn'gun, focused on defending against foreign invasion and constantly diligent in reconnaissance, heard this urgent report. Not only did he lack the slightest fear, but he declared that the time to annihilate the Western barbarians (洋夷) had arrived. He sent urgent dispatches (飛檄) to the eight provinces, quickly summoning brave soldiers from all directions. He appointed Yi Kyŏngha, who had previously achieved great merit in suppressing the Catholics, as Commanding Inspector (巡撫使), Colonel (千摠) Yang Hŏnsu as Left Vanguard Commander, Garrison Commander (中軍) Ŏ Chaeyŏn as Right Vanguard Commander, and Han Sŏnggŭn and Yi Changnyŏm as Mobile Strike Generals (遊擊將軍), ordering them to strictly defend the key points of Munsu (in T'ongjin), Kwangsŏng, and Ch'oji (in Kanghwa). Furthermore, along the Han River banks, from Yanghwajin for about 10 *ri*, various sand barges (沙船) were sunk to block the French ships' entry. However, the French fleet first unleashed fierce bombardment, capturing the two fortresses of Ch'oji and Kwangsŏng, and advanced to attack Kanghwa Castle. The Governor (留守) Yi In'gwi and the T'ongjin Magistrate (府使) Yi Kongnyŏm abandoned the castle and fled, and Kanghwa Castle consequently fell to the enemy. (At this time, the former Minister [判書] Yi Siwŏn, hearing the report of the castle's fall, committed suicide by drinking poison with his younger brother, County Magistrate [郡守] Yi Chiwŏn). This Kanghwa Island was historically a vital stronghold for the nation, located at a strategic point for the capital, housing armories and treasuries (兵庫 金庫), and serving as a key route for transporting provisions to the capital. Therefore, if the French forces were to occupy this castle permanently, the capital itself could hardly remain secure. When this news spread through the country, the court and populace were shaken, and some even began to advocate for peace negotiations. However, the indomitable, strong-willed Taewŏn'gun absolutely refused to listen, determined to crush the Western thieves down to the last man and the last moment.

(At that time, when one of our defending generals requested peace terms from the enemy admiral, the latter replied: "I have come on behalf of the Emperor [翁帝 likely refers to Napoleon III] to punish your country for killing Frenchmen. Bring three of your country's ruling ministers [國 執政] to apologize for their crimes, and furthermore, send a plenipotentiary envoy to my ship to conclude a treaty of amity.") Thus, although the French army had seized Kanghwa Island (江都), they realized that our court would not yield easily. They desired to make a final major attack to assault the capital directly, but perceived that the blockade on the Han River was too strong to dare navigate it. Inevitably, they decided to attack the capital overland, first dispatching a reconnaissance force to attack T'ongjin Castle, and next attacking Munsusan Castle (文殊山城).<64> However, the fortress terrain was rugged, making land warfare extremely difficult, and our forces, holding the advantageous ground, defended well, preventing the enemy from advancing even a single step. For over ten days, the two sides remained deadlocked. At this, the Taewŏn'gun mustered even greater courage, inspiring a spirit of hostility towards the enemy among the general populace. Simultaneously, he summoned 800 renowned sharpshooters (名捕手) from Kangwŏn and Kanggye, considered the strongest fighters under heaven at the time. Organizing them into two units, one reinforced the Munsu forces, while the other made a direct thrust towards Kanghwa, occupying Chŏngjoksan Fortress (鼎足 山城) and attacking the enemy from both head and tail (首尾). Morale instantly soared, and enemy casualties reached nearly half. Thus, the French forces, suffering repeated defeats, dared not face the Korean army. They fled back to Kanghwa, defending the desolate castle like a setting sun (落日之狐城). Finally, they shot poisoned arrows (毒矢), set fires within the castle, abandoned large quantities of military supplies, and retreated to Qing China. This was the famous second French incursion of Pyŏngin.

VI. The Pyŏngin Yangyo and Its Results
As described above, this campaign was the first clash between Koreans and white people, and both engagements resulted in defeat for the French. They were not only unable to carry out their declared revenge for the killing of missionaries, but they also failed to rescue the two remaining priests hiding in the mountains. Admiral Roze, to cover up his own failure, submitted false reports to his government. As a result, the Taewŏn'gun became even more triumphant, thoroughly promoting the doctrine of "repel barbarians, close the country" (攘夷 鎖國). He erected stone monuments on major streets inscribed with "洋夷侵犯, 非戰卽和, 主和賣國" (Western Barbarian Invasion: To not fight is to make peace; to advocate peace is to sell the country). He also ordered ink slabs (墨上) to be engraved with these twelve characters on their surface to demonstrate the intention never to reconcile with Westerners. On the other hand, he repaired weapons and built higher fortress walls in preparation for the future. Later, in Sinmi (1871), riding the lingering prestige of the Pyŏngin victory, he repelled a five-ship American survey fleet at Kanghwa (this is the Sinmi Yangyo [辛未洋擾]; in this battle, Garrison Commander Ŏ Chaeyŏn and his brother died fighting). The Taewŏn'gun's power shook the rivers and mountains of the peninsula, like beasts cowering before a fierce tiger; no one, inside or outside the country, dared to oppose him. However, his stubborn anti-Westernism and anachronistic isolationism only resulted in the tragic killing of innocent lives (Catholic massacre victims estimated at around 200,000 - [Note: this number is likely exaggerated]), retarded the people's culture, and misguided the nation's hundred-year plan. What benefit was there? The victory of the Pyŏngin Yangyo is simultaneously a great radiance and a great shadow in modern Korean history. Today, sixty years of sorrowful winds and tragic rains later, although the rivers and mountains remain the same, the stars have shifted and things have changed (星移物換). Catholic believers, once driven out like flocks of sheep, now sing hymns of praise everywhere. Children with blue eyes and purple beards (碧眼紫髥) and gangs of short-statured, red-footed people [likely referring to Japanese] swaggeringly stride along the main streets of the capital. Even the spirit of the Taewŏn'gun, sleeping peacefully beneath the pine winds in a corner of Kongdŏk-ri (孔德里), how could he not be filled with boundless emotion? Alas! Pyŏngin has returned, but where is the peerless hero of that time now? <65>

**Summary**

This 1926 article by Ch'a Sangch'an reflects on the 60th anniversary of the Pyŏngin Yangyo (1866 French Campaign against Korea). It recounts the political background under the Taewŏn'gun's regency, the rise of Catholicism, the brutal anti-Catholic persecutions leading to French intervention, the two French naval incursions near Kanghwado, and the ultimate Korean military victories. While celebrating the victories as moments of national pride against Western powers, the author critically assesses the Taewŏn'gun's subsequent reinforcement of isolationism (鎖國主義) and anti-foreignism (攘夷主義), arguing it ultimately harmed Korea's development and led to immense suffering (citing a likely inflated figure of 200,000 Catholic martyrs). He concludes with a poignant observation of the changed landscape of Korea 60 years later, where Western religion and foreign presence (including Japanese) are commonplace, pondering how the Taewŏn'gun would perceive these changes. For historians, the article offers a near-contemporary (1926) Korean perspective on these pivotal 19th-century events, blending nationalistic sentiment about military success with a critical view of isolationist policies common during the colonial period's re-evaluation of late Chosŏn history. The specific details provided about military appointments, locations, and the sequence of events, alongside the author's interpretive framing, are valuable.

六十年 前의 朝鮮과 洋擾
						車相瓚
緖言-洋擾 이전의 조선 政局-露반 來元과 西敎徒의 暗躍-西敎徒의 대학살과 佛艦의 第1回 來寇-佛艦의 第2회 來寇와 朝鮮軍의 大捷-丙寅洋擾와 其 結果

一. 緖 言
今年은 丙寅이다. 丙寅은 우리 朝鮮人에게 가장 인상이 깁고 感慨가 만흔 해다. 유사 이후 4,252년 간 凡 71회 丙寅에(금년까지) 역사의 중요 페지는 거의 腥風血雨의 전란으로 充 하얏다. 즉 高句麗 東川王 20년 丙寅 (檀紀 2,579)에는 魏의 毋(관)丘儉이 國都 9都城을 來寇하야 국왕이 일시 南沃沮로 播遷 하얏다가 다시 격퇴하고 新羅 炤智王 8년 丙寅 (2,819) 에는 왜구가 변경을 침략하다가 敗歸하고, 其後 고구려 寶藏王 25년 丙寅(2,999)에는 彼 유명한 莫支離 泉蓋蘇文公이 卒逝하고 其子 男生, 男建, 男産의 삼형제가 相爭하는 虛機를 乘하야 唐의 李勣이 來侵 하엿고 李朝 燕山 11년 丙寅(3,839)에는 王位의 革命亂이 起하야 虐君 燕山이 폐위되고, 中宗이 繼位하얏스며 또 근세 李太皇 3년 丙寅에는(4,199) 세인이 皆知하는 洋擾가 起하얏다. 然而 洋擾 이외의 諸 戰亂은 비록 其亂이 大하얏슬지라도 但히 亞細亞 同人族 간의 전쟁에 止하얏스되 東方의 君子國으로＜60＞ 소위 碧紫眼髥의 白人과 兵火를 交 하기는 이 丙寅의 洋擾가 쳐음이엿다. 물론 이 洋擾는 원래 佛國의 本國과 국제적으로 開始된 전쟁도 안이요 또 長久한 세월을 亘한 전쟁도 안이고 蝸角의 蠻蜀爭과 如한 一時的 충돌에 불과한 擾亂이나 近世 조선에 잇서서 널리 세계에 선포되고 또 정치상 사상상에 파급한 영향은 실로 多大하얏다. 江華島의 勝捷鼓는 일시에 大院君의 攘夷 思想과 鎖國主義를 더 鼓動하얏스나 一方으로 不遠한 장래에 조선을 세계적으로 開放 한다는 報信鼓가 되엿다. 국제간 修好도 그 餘響으로 되고 人民의 사상 자유도 그 뒤부터 맹아 되얏다. 양요 후 60년을 經한 今日에 在 하야 녯 일을 생각하면 誰가 능히 滄桑의 感을 금하랴. 이제 나는 丙寅을 마지면서 다싊� 洋擾를 추억 하고 당시의 史實을 略論코자 한다.

二. 洋擾 이전의 조선 政局
洋擾 이전의 조선 政局은 실로 多事多端 하얏다. 哲宗이 在位한 지 14년 간에 外戚의 跋扈와 朋黨의 軋轢이 극도에 달하야 國事가 日非하되 능히 匡正치 못하고 癸亥에 崩御하매 其 嗣가 無 하야 興宣君의 第二子 高宗 太星帝가 12의 幼齡으로 位에 卽하고 大院君이 攝政을 하게 되니 당시 外戚 金씨에 在하던 조선의 정권은 다시 大院君 手中으로 歸하얏다. 大院君은 왕실의 권위를 회복하고 귀족의 전횡을 制하며 외척의 세력을 抑하야 몬저 대신의 黜陟을 감행하니 趙斗淳은 영의정, 金炳學은 우의정, 李宜翼, 鄭基世, 金世均은 吏兵戶判書, 李升輔는 宜惠堂上, 李景夏는 훈련대장겸 左捕盜대장, 李漳濂은 禁衛大將, 李景宇는 御營大將, 李邦鉉은 總戒使, 申命純은 右捕盜大將이 되고 또 경복궁을 重建(乙丑)하며 제도을 크게 변경하야  備邊司를 폐하고, 三軍府를 設하야 現任 將相으로 하야금 兼任케 하고 江華府를 陞하야 鎭撫營이라 하고 壯勇을 募 하되 別驍士라 하야 其 營에 속케 하고 咸鏡北道에 茂山 厚州郡 등 4군을 置하야 이민 개척하고 또 武臣의 乘轎를 금하야 公私 출입에 馬를 乘케 하며 尙 又 一方으로 滿洲의 馬匹을 강구하야 富民으로 하야금 1, 2匹 식 飼畜케 하고 서원을 철폐하는 동시에 忠動人 자손의 免布法를 폐하니 비록 一部의 不平과 불만을 구하는 자가 有하나 其剛 勇猛斷의 威風은 능히 四隣을 懾服 하고 萬姓을 굴복하야＜61＞ 半島의 江山은 恰然히 대원군의 天下가 되고 純哲시대에 衰衛 障地 하얏던 李씨의 왕권은 다시 千丈 萬丈의 上에 挽回하야 中興의 曙光을 庶見케 되얏다.

三. 露艦의 來元과 西敎徒의 暗躍   是에 先하야 憲宗 6년 庚子에 佛國 선교사가 중국 山東省 芝盃에서 淸의 商船을 乘하고 南鮮 방면에 密行하야 布敎를 盛히 하더니(천주교의 入國은 물론 其 이전부터다) 哲宗 시대에 至하야는 其 徒가 屢萬에 달하고 선교사 「따뿔에루이」와 如한 人은 宮中에 까지 출입하며 또 太皇帝의 유모 朴씨와 承旨 南鐘三, 洪鳳周, 李身逵 등이다. 天主敎를 신봉하니 其 蔓延의 勢가 燎原의 火와 如히 日로 盛하얏다. 其後 甲子 1월에 至하야 露國 군함  1척이 元山에 來하야 정부에 書를 致하고 通商을 請하니 大院君이 단연이 거절하고 露國의 來襲을 憂慮하야 大히 軍備를 修할새 일본에 人을 遣하야 鳥銃 小刀 槍 등을 購求 하며, 江華의 城柵, 文殊의 山城, 永宗 仁川의 砲臺를 修築 하야 南陽灣의 守備를 嚴히 하며 漢城의 성곽을 개축하고 대포를 鑄하야 外寇 防備에 專力하니 南鐘三 등이 此機를 乘하야 천주교의 공인을 得하리라 하고 南尙敎와 相謀한 후 大院君에게 獻言하되 今에 露國이 我 北境을 來侵하야 남하할 야욕이 有하니 此를 방어하랴면 天下 막강한 佛國과 修好하야 其力을 借함만 갓지 못하고 또 此를 斡旋 함에는 佛國 선교사를 결탁 함이 可하다 하니, 大院君이 其意를 知 하고, 佯히 허락한 후 心腹을 密遺하야 內情을 探하다가 南鐘三의 家에 張敬一이라 하는 佛國 선교사가 隱伏한 것을 발견 하고 大怒하야 西敎 禁制의 舊典을 復用 하기로 결심하고 당시 여행 중에 잇는 佛國 선교사 「따뿔에루이」, 「뻐루누」 兩人을 謁見까지 거절하얏다.

四. 西敎徒의 대학살과 佛艦의 第一回 來寇
未幾에 露艦이 無事 退去하고 西敎 排斥論이 국내에 더욱 沸騰하니 大院君이 평소에 西敎 증오하던 怒氣를 일시 발휘하야 疾風猛虎의 勢로 丙寅 2월 20일에 돌연히 左捕廳에 西敎徒 퇴치의 事를 엄명하고, 萬籟俱戚한 暗夜를 乘하야 南鐘三, 南尙敎, 李身逵, 洪鳳周 등의 가택을 포위하고 其 가족 외 佛國人 張敬一 등 수십여人을 一網打盡하야＜62＞ 捕廳에 牢囚 하얏다가 일시 刑殺하고 또 당시 훈련대장 李景夏로 하야금 三軍을 領率하고 城內 城外를 大索하야 西敎信者 수만여人(물론 무관계자 亦 多함)을 群羊과 如히 捕縛 하야 21일로 23일 까지 3일을 亘하야 혹은 撲殺 혹은 銃殺 혹은 埋殺 혹은 斬殺하니 남녀노소의 哀呼悲痛의 聲이 雲霄를 干하고 漢城의 天地는 一時 尸山 血海로 化하얏다. 嗚呼 인생의 無情이 此 極에 달하니 당시 悲絶慘絶의 事를 思하면 비록 今日에 在한들 엇지 毛骨이 慄然치 안이 하랴. 大院君은 但히 漢城에 잇는 천주교도만 학살할 뿐 안이라 각 州郡에도 엄명하야 동일한 慘劇을 演케 하고 또 佛國 宣敎師 「페루누」, 「따블에루이」 외 9명을 옥중에 牢囚하얏다가 3월 8일에 일시 刑場에 引出하고 4백의 병졸로 半月狀의 陳을 列한 후 彼等을 나체 참살하고 此外에 國中을 또 搜索하야 5人의 弘法師를 참살하니 殘餘의 弘法師 3人은 산중에 도피하야 僅히 생명을 保할 뿐이엿다. 其 中 1人인 「리데루」가 逃難하야 충청도 內浦에서 英船을 乘하고 淸國의 芝盃를 經하야 天津에 在한 당시 佛國 水師提督 「로-제」 에게 告急하니 「로-제」 비록크게 同情하나 때는 마츰 佛國이 交趾 支那에 事가 有하야 急히 艦隊를 조선에 파견할 餘力이 無함으로 時日을 銁�延하다가 同年 9월 초순에 淸國駐箚代理公使 「페로네」의 命에 의하야 芝盃에 着한 「고루우에도」 形船 「뿌리모계」號 哨船 「데루레데」 號 及 砲艦 「다루지소」호를 率하고 선교사 「리데루」와 伴來한 조선인 水夫 3人을 從하야 9월 18일에 芝盃를 發하야 同 20일 夕에 「뽀아세」島에 投錙 하고 翌 21일에 提督은 또 京城에 入하는 道를 探하기 위하야 哨船 「데루레데」號를 先히 派送하고 통역 「리데루」와 水夫 3인을 案內로 삼앗섯다. 此 哨船은 江華해협을 密入하야 甲串津에 投 錙 하고 노정과 防備 여부를 搜探하고提督에게 報하니 提督은 遂히 漢江을 溯하야 京城을 直衝하랴고 3척의 船을 派送하엿다. 그러나 「뿌리모계」號는 中途에서 암초에 觸하야 破傷됨으로 同行치 못하고 提督은 但히 2艦을 率하고 漢江으로 溯하야 25일 夕에 楊花鎭에 投錙하고 京城을 侵襲하랴다가 京城에 防備가 嚴함을 知하고, 감히 접근치 못하고 沿岸 防備君과 數次 砲火를 相交 하다가 兵寡難敵 함을 知하고 但히 1日을 留하면서 水의 深淺과 地形의 險易를 측량한 후 更히 漢江으로 下하야 본래 投錨地인 江華로 退住하다가 9월 30일에 다시 芝盃로 退去하니 此가 즉 佛艦의 제1회 來寇다.＜63＞

五. 佛艦의 第2回 來寇와 朝鮮軍의 大捷
然而 此 第1回의 佛寇는 원래 彼의 兵勢가 미약하야 아군과 敢戰치 못하고 但히 後日 再寇의 예비로 朝鮮의 防備 如何와 道路 山川의 險易를 搜探하고 퇴거함에 불과하나 조선인은 일시 意氣가 昻然하야 洋賊은 足히 可交의 値가 無하다 하고 西敎徒를 더욱 학대하며 또 一方으로 兵器 城柵을 수정하야 만일을 備하니 攘夷斥和의 氣가 宇內에 충만하얏다. 佛國 水師提督 「로제」는 第1回의 실패를 憤慨히 思하고 다시 복수 來襲을 計하다가 10월 11일에 至하야 大小 軍艦 7척으로 1함대를 조직하고 일본 橫濱으로 부터 來한 海兵隊 600 人을 탑승케 한 후 至盃를 發하야 30일에 「뽀아세」島에 着하얏다. 당시 大院君은 외구 방비에 專意 하야 항상 搜探을 不怠하던 차 此 急報를 聞하매 小毫도 畏懼의 心이 無할 뿐 안이라 洋夷 碎滅의 시기가 此에 到하얏다 하고 8道에 飛檄 하야 급히 사방의 勇軍을 徵하고 또 先是 西敎徒 퇴치에 大功을 奏한 李景夏로 巡撫使를 삼고 千摠 梁憲洙로 左先鋒, 中軍 魚在淵으로 右先鋒, 韓聖根, 李漳濂으로 遊擊 장군을 삼아 文殊(通津), 廣城, 草芝(江華)의 요새를 嚴守케 하고 又 漢江 연안에는 楊花津으로 부터 10여里 간에 諸 沙船을 沈하야 佛艦의 진입, 遮斷 하얏다. 그러나 佛艦은 先히 猛砲를 射하야 草芝 廣城 兩 요새를 함락하고 進하야 江華城을 攻하니 留守 李寅夔와 通津府使 李公濂이 棄城 逃走하고 江華城이 遂히 적군에게 陷한 바 되얏다(時에 전 判書 李是遠이 陷城의 報를 聞하고 其 弟 郡守 李止遠과 飮毒 자살하다) 此 江華는 역대 국가의 重鎭으로 경성의 요충에 당하야 兵庫 金庫의 設이 有하고 경성 식량운수의 요로읊� 고로 佛軍이 만일 比 성을 영구히 據할 時는 京城이 또한 安保를 得키 難함으로 此 報가 1次 國內에 傳하매 上下 震驚하야 一時 和議를 唱하는 자까지 有 하얏다. 그러나 不屈不撓하는 剛勇强骨의 大院君은 절대로 聽從치 안이하고 최후 一人 一刻 까지 洋賊을 擊碎하랴고 결심하얏다.


(其時 我軍의 일守將이 적 제독에게 화의를 사청한 즉 彼는 答하되 余가 *翁帝를 代하야 佛人을 殺한 汝國을 貴伐 하기 위하야 來하얏슨 즉*國 執政 3人을 인도하야 其 죄를 謝하고 且 全權을 我船에 送하야 修好의 約을 結함이 可하다 云云 하얏다)  如斯히 佛軍은 江都을 襲取 하얏스나 我廷이 容易히 屈치 안이함을 知하며, 또 최후 大 공격을 하야 京城을 直犯코자 하나, 漢江의 防塞이 嚴하야 감히 航行치 못할 줄 覺하고 不得已 육로로 京城을 습격하랴고 몬저 斥候隊를 파견하야 通津城을 攻하고 次에 文殊산성을 攻하얏스나＜64＞  城池가 險阻 하야 陸戰이 심히 곤란하고 且 我軍이 險을 據하야 善히 방어 함으로 감히 일보도 진전치 못하고 旬餘를 피차 相持할 뿐이엿다. 이에 大院君은 一層의 용기을 加하야 일반 인민에게 敵愾의 心을 고무하는 동시에 당시 天下 莫强의 健兒인 江原, 江界 兩地의 명포수 8백명을 소집하야 兩隊로 편성한 後로 1隊는 文殊軍을 응원하고 1隊 江華에 直衝하야 鼎足 山城을 據하고 敵을 首尾로 공격하니 士氣가 일시에 振作하고 적의 死者가 태반에 至하얏다. 如斯히 佛軍은 連戰連敗하야 감히 조선군을 대항치 못하고 江華로 復逃 하야 落日의 狐城을 守하다가 최후에 毒矢을 射하야 성 중에 放火하고 다수의 군수품을 棄한 후 淸國으로 退走하니 此가 즉 유명한 丙寅의 第2回 佛寇다.

六. 丙寅 洋擾와 及 其 結果
상술함과 如히 此 戰役은 조선인과 백인 간의 최초 交鋒으로 兩役이 共히 佛人의 패배에 歸하야 彼等의 聲言 하던 소위 선교사 살해의 복수를 행하기 不能할 뿐 안이라 山中에 殘존한 2人의 弘法師도 구출함을 不得하고 提督 로제」는 자기의 失態를 掩蔽하기 위하야 其國 政府에 허위의 보고를 하얏슬 뿐이엿다. 其 결과로 大院君은 더욱 意氣滿滿 하야 攘夷 鎖國의 主義를 철저히 高調하고 通街大道에 「洋夷侵犯, 非戰卽和, 主和賣國」 이라 刻銘한 石碑를 立 하며 또 墨上을 명하야 墨面에 이상 12자를 印記하야 洋人과 永久 勿和할 意를 示하고 一方으로 무기를 整修하며 城을 高築하야 後日을 備하다가 其後 辛未에 다시 丙寅 勝捷의 餘威를 乘하야 米國의 측량함대 5척을 江華에서 격퇴하니(此卽 辛未洋擾니 此戰에 中軍 魚在淵 兄弟가 戰死함) 大院君의 위력은 능히 반도의 강산을 震*하야 猛虎의 前에 百獸가 慴伏함과 如히 內外人 중 誰가 감히 抗言치 못하얏다. 그러나 그의 완연한 洋夷主義와 逆時의 쇄국주의는 但이 무사의 생령을 참살하고(西敎徒 학살 약 20만명) 인민의 문화를 낙오케 하야 국가 백년의 대계를 誤하얏슬 뿐이니 何等의 이익이 有하리오 丙寅洋擾의 勝捷은 근세 조선 역사 상에 일대 광채인 동시에 일대 暗影이라 可謂하겟다. 悲風 慘雨 60년을 經한 今日에 江山은 비록 依舊하나 星移物換하야 當年에 群羊과 如히 驅逐을 當하던 西敎의 신도가 도처에 讚美의 歌를 부르고 碧眼紫髥의 兒와 短軀赤足의 徒가 장안 大道 上으로 揚揚 馳走하니 彼 孔德里 一隅 松風下에 閒眠하는 大院君의 英靈인들 엇지 감개가 무량치 안이하랴. 嗚呼 丙寅이 重到한데 당시 蓋世의 영웅이 於今安在哉오.＜65＞
