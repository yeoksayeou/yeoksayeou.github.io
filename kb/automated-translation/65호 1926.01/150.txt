Two Million Communist Party Members

The Worker-Peasant Russian Communist Party (勞農露國共産黨) has announced its party membership numbers as follows.

The total population, which was about 180 million before the war, has now decreased to 165 million. The number of Communist Party members is 2,161,403, within which there are 815,720 male Communist Party members, 114,950 female Communist Party members, 764,636 male candidate members (준공산당원), 50,077 female candidate members, 351,067 male membership applicants (가맹지원자), and 64,913 female membership applicants. <91>

**Summary**

This short news report provides statistics on the membership of the Communist Party in Soviet Russia (referred to as "Worker-Peasant Russia") as of late 1925 or early 1926. It details the total number of members (over 2.1 million), broken down by gender and membership status (full members, candidate members, and applicants), and contrasts this with the country's total population, noting a decrease since before the war (presumably WWI/Russian Revolution/Civil War). For historians studying colonial Korea, this article reflects the keen interest among Korean intellectuals and activists in the developments within the Soviet Union, particularly the structure and scale of the Communist Party, during a period when socialist and communist ideas were gaining traction as potential paths to national liberation and social change. The detailed breakdown suggests access to official Soviet reports or news transmitted internationally.
