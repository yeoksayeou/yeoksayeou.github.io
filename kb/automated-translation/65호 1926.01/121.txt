**Summary**

This article, titled "Looking Back at Byŏngin Years," presents a chronological list of significant events in Korean history that occurred in years corresponding to the Byŏngin (丙寅) sign in the sexagenary cycle, using the Tangun Era calendar. Spanning from legendary times (Tangun) through the Three Kingdoms, Unified Silla, Parhae, Koryŏ, and Chosŏn periods up to 1866 (the most recent Byŏngin year before the 1926 publication), it highlights major political, military, cultural, and diplomatic occurrences. These include dynastic successions, wars, establishment of institutions, cultural achievements like the creation of Hunminjŏngŭm, foreign relations with China and Japan, natural disasters, and significant events like the 1866 Catholic Persecution and French invasion.

From the perspective of Korean colonial history, the article is interesting for several reasons. Firstly, its use of the Tangun Era (檀紀) reflects a nationalist consciousness attempting to establish a long, continuous, and independent historical narrative counter to Japanese colonial historiography. Secondly, the selection of events emphasizes moments of national achievement (e.g., Hunminjŏngŭm), resistance against foreign powers (e.g., Koguryŏ vs. Wei/Tang, Koryŏ vs. Khitan, 1866 vs. France), and internal political milestones, potentially aiming to foster national pride and historical awareness during a period of subjugation. The inclusion of the 1866 events serves as a recent reminder of resistance against Western powers, possibly resonating with anti-colonial sentiments.
