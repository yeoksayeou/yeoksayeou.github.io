靑春傾社稷, 白首汚江湖
(Youth Toppled the State, Old Age Polluted the World)

When Sim Chŏng (沈貞) initiated the Kimyo Sahwa (己卯士禍, Literati Purge of 1519), almost completely annihilating the scholars of the time, he later retired and resided at Soyojŏng (逍遙亭). He hung a plaque on the wall and composed various verses, writing them on the plaque. One couplet read:
「靑春扶社稷, 白首臥江湖」
(In youth, I supported the state; in old age, I rest outside the political world.)

One night, a knight-errant appeared, carrying a sword, and berated Chŏng, saying, "You instigated the literati purge, nearly wiping out the virtuous folk and almost overthrowing the state. How dare you inscribe a poem with phrases like 'supporting the state' and 'resting outside the political world' and hang it on a plaque? If you do not quickly correct those two characters, '扶' (support) and '臥' (rest), I shall immediately take your head." Chŏng, trembling and prostrating himself in apology, said, "I shall rightly do as you instruct. Then how about changing the character '扶' to '危' (endanger) and substituting the character '臥' with '蟄' (lie hidden/hibernate)?" The knight-errant replied, "That won't do. It is fitting to change '扶' to '傾' (topple/overthrow) and change '臥' to '汚' (pollute/defile)." Chŏng could only say, "I shall follow your command." Later, his fifth-generation descendant [*name not given] went up to Soyojŏng and recorded a poem reflecting on the past, one couplet of which reads: 「奮恨波難洗 新愁酒欲春」 (Indignation is hard for the waves to wash away; new sorrow makes wine long for spring). This is likely a poem born from the extreme of lamentation. (From Hyŏnho Swaedam) <76>

**Summary**

The article recounts an anecdote about Sim Chŏng, a historical figure responsible for the bloody Kimyo Literati Purge of 1519. After retiring, Sim Chŏng inscribed a self-congratulatory couplet on a plaque, claiming he supported the state in his youth and lived peacefully retired in old age. A mysterious knight-errant confronted him, forcing him under threat of death to change the couplet to reflect his actual deeds: "Youth Toppled the State, Old Age Polluted the World." The piece concludes with a verse by Sim Chŏng's descendant expressing enduring sorrow and resentment. From a colonial history perspective, this story, published in 1921 under Japanese rule, could be interpreted allegorically. The forced correction of a powerful figure's self-serving historical narrative might implicitly critique the Japanese colonial authorities' control over historical discourse and resonate with Korean aspirations for historical truth and justice. The theme of unwashable indignation and sorrow could also reflect the contemporary sentiments of Koreans under occupation.

靑春傾社稷, 白首汚江湖
沈貞이 己卯士禍를 起하야써 當世의 士子를 거의 盡戮하고 後에 身을 退하야 逍遙亭에 居할새 壁上에 板을  懸하고 여러 가지의 題詠을 지어써 板上에 書하얏는데 其一聯에 曰
「靑春扶社稷, 白首臥江湖」
라 하얏다. 一日夜에 俠客이 잇서 劒을 杖하고 貞을 詬叱하야 曰 「네가 士禍를 作하야 善類― 殆盡하고 宗社― 幾覆하얏거늘 어찌 敢히 扶社稷, 臥江湖 等의 語로써 詩를 題하야 懸板에 揭하얏느냐. 네가 만일 빨니 그 扶臥 兩字를 改正치 아니하면 내가 곳 너의 首를 聚하리라. 貞이 顫伏附謝하야 曰 맛당히 下敎대로 하겟습니다. 그러면 扶字를 危字로 改하고 臥字를 蟄字로 代함이 어떠하겟습니까. 俠客이 曰 「안되겟다. 扶字를 傾으로 改하고 臥字를 汚로 改함이 宜하니라. 貞이 只曰 唯命是從하리다 하엿다. 그 後 5代孫 *가 逍遙亭에 올라 記錄한 感 古詩의 一聯에 曰 「奮恨波難洗 新愁酒欲春」이라 하얏나니 大盖嘆의 極에서 나온 詩이다.
