A Look Back at Pan-Sinyu [The Year 1921]
						One Reporter

This Sinyu year, which we so eagerly anticipated and clung to, hoping to live it meaningfully and valuably, is already bidding us farewell. Now, as we send off this year and look back at the past, while there is a certain sense of self-satisfaction, it is also difficult to suppress feelings of dissatisfaction. To what extent did our actions, our lives, reach during this year? It would not be meaningless to excerpt these day by day, month by month. Of course, there were numerous complex phenomena, big and small, during this period, but due to lack of time, we will only mention a few important points worth considering to express our sentiments of parting and to plan for the future.
Addendum: Although there are cartoons by Master Artist Ko Hŭidong (高羲東 畵伯) for each month in this article, they will be included together under this topic in the New Year issue.

January
Although it may seem like a worthless matter because such phenomena will unfold before our eyes shortly, I write this to consider the extent to which our society's year-end courtesies for last year, this year, or the New Year have reached.
The Sinyu Year and New Year's Cards: According to one newspaper, the number of New Year's cards sent by Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul) residents for the Sinyu year was 2,316,664 (by December 30th, Kyŏngsin year). Laid end-to-end, they would stretch from Kyŏngsŏng to Taegu, and stacked, they would reach a height of 1,617 ch'ŏk (feet), representing a 59% increase compared to last year. From this, we can see how much the New Year's etiquette of our populace has improved. It is worth noting how many New Year's cards there will be next year, namely Imsul.
Mr. Bethmann Dies: "Former German Chancellor Mr. Bethmann, who shook hands with the extraordinary figure of the era, the Kaiser <77> and attempted to fight the world at the start of the European turmoil, died overnight on the 1st from lung disease."
This Fiscal Year's Budget Draft: The Government-General of Chosŏn announced this fiscal year's budget as 156,941,689 wŏn. Compared to last year's budget of 123,809,943 wŏn, this is an increase of 33,131,746 wŏn. From this, it seems the Government-General's policy towards Chosŏn has become somewhat more generous.
Monopoly Bureau Newly Established: The Government-General of Chosŏn newly established a Monopoly Bureau within the Government-General building, deciding to monopolize four items: tobacco, salt, ginseng, and opium. It plans to purchase the Tōa Tobacco Company and 23 private tobacco manufacturing factories and implement this within the year.
Resolution of the Education Investigation Committee: The Education Investigation Committee, tasked with investigating the actual state of education in Chosŏn and planning appropriate educational facilities, held committee meetings within the Government-General from July to November. It resolved on principles such as implementing Japanese-Korean education equally, connecting Japanese and Korean schools, and respecting the desire for learning, with Japan-Korea balance as the main theme.
Japanese Buddhist Monks' Suffrage Movement: 100,000 monks from 13 sects and 56 factions, including Yoshida Gen'ō of the Tendai sect and Satō Nikkei of the Nichiren sect, launched a major suffrage movement targeting the Japanese government.
Chinese Students Boycott Japanese Goods: A large-scale movement by students to boycott Japanese goods arose in various cities in South China, such as Sichuan and Chongqing, leading to major clashes between merchants and students.
New Phase for Chosŏn Buddhism: The general assembly of chief priests from 30 head temples convened in Kyŏngsŏng. Deciding on a major reform centered on modernizing Buddhism, they also planned to establish educational and missionary organizations with a budget of 300,000 wŏn.
US Captain Shooting Incident and Dispute: A major dispute arose between Japanese and American military personnel after Private Ogasawara Toshigorō, a sentry at the headquarters of the Japanese Army's 11th Division Commander at Vladivostok's Peter the Great Fort, shot and killed US Navy Engineering Chief Lieutenant Langdon (란크돈). (9th)
North-South China War Begins: The Northern and Southern governments, based on mutual conflicts of will, finally began a war.
Increase in Yi Royal Family's Annual Allowance: Previously 1.5 million wŏn, it was decided to submit a proposal to the assembly to increase it to 2 million wŏn due to high commodity prices and other circumstances.
Decree for Appointing Korean Vice-Consuls: Under the premise that it is appropriate to appoint Korean consuls in places where many Koreans reside, such as Manchuria and Russian territories, the decree for appointing Korean Vice-Consuls was promulgated.
Japan-China Military Agreement Abolished: The military agreement between the two countries, which had been a major issue, was abolished as of the 20th.
Kaebyŏk vs. Police Station Trial: An issue arose between the Tongdaemun Police Station and an article titled "Demands for Youth Groups Everywhere" <78> in the December issue of Kaebyŏk last year, eventually leading to a public trial at the Kyŏngsŏng District Court. Following the defense statement by Kaebyŏk publisher Yi Tu-sŏng (李斗星), lawyers Chang T'ao (張燾), Pak Sŭngbin (朴勝彬), Kim Ch'anyŏng (金瓚永), Yi Ki-ch'an (李基璨), and Yi Sŭng-u (李升雨) provided sympathetic supporting arguments. (24th)
Elementary School Teachers' Suffrage Movement: 3,000 elementary school teachers from various cities in Japan jointly signed and launched a suffrage movement targeting government authorities.
Yi Royal Crown Prince Returns to Chosŏn: He disembarked at Pusan on the 27th to participate in the second anniversary memorial rite (Taesangje) for the late former Emperor Yi (Yi T'aewang).
Emperor Kojong's Memorial Rite: The second anniversary memorial rite for Emperor Kojong (Kojong T'aehwangje) was grandly held within Ch'angdŏk Palace on the 28th.
Koreans in Japan Attack Osaka Newspaper Company: Claiming defamation due to inaccurate reporting, several hundred people, including Sin T'aegyun (申泰均), president of the Korean Labor Relief Society, and Pak Chuik (朴珠翊), a traveling salesman for a ginseng company, attacked an Osaka newspaper company, causing a major disturbance.

Month's End Summary
Being the start of the New Year, phenomena were undoubtedly numerous. However, there were no particularly major events. The few items above represent the main points. Besides these, there were matters concerning the Korean Independence Party domestically and overseas, disputes among our people in Russian territories and Manchuria/Mongolia, unrest in India, the England-Ireland issue, the Japan-US issue, etc. But globally, nothing prominent occurred, nor was anything settled. Therefore, we conclude January with this.

February
Great Turmoil on the Chinese Eastern Railway: Three groups—Koreans, mounted bandits, and radicals (過激派)—totaling 30,000, united and became rampant, advocating for the Korean issue or radical propaganda.
North Manchuria and the Black Death: The Black Death (plague) became rampant in areas like Harbin in North Manchuria, causing numerous deaths.
Issue of Chinese Police Shooting Our Compatriot: Regarding the shooting death of our compatriot by Chinese police in Yongjŏng (龍井) city, Kando (間島), our compatriots held a Korean rally to question the responsibility of the Chinese authorities.
Osaka Brotherhood Association: On the first day of the first lunar month, over 300 brothers residing in Osaka, including Pak Hŭng-gye (朴興桂), Yi Sŏn-gwang (李善光), Kim Chin-sŏn (金鎭善), Sin Ch'ang-nak (辛昌洛), organized the Brotherhood Association (兄弟會) mainly for fellowship and overseas development.
A Questionable Major Incident: A certain major incident occurred within the Japanese Imperial Household Ministry, greatly troubling the top leadership in official circles.
Min Wŏn-sik Assassinated: Min Wŏn-sik (閔元植), president of the National Association (國民協會長), who regarded himself as the leader of New Japanism (新日本主義), crossed over to Japan to campaign for Korean suffrage in the 44th Diet and was assassinated by Yang Kŭn-hwan (梁槿煥) at Tokyo Station on the morning of the 16th.
General Association Organized: Over 3,000 Koreans residing in Soch'up'ung (小秋風), Russian territory, including Sŏ Il (徐一), Kim Chwa-jin (金佐鎭), Cho Myŏng-nok (趙明錄), Hong Pŏm-do (洪範圖), organized the General Association (總合會) and busied themselves with the independence movement. <79>

Yudo Founded: On February 28th, the inaugural issue of "Yudo" (儒道), the organ paper of the Society for the Promotion of Confucianism (儒道振興會), was published.

Month's End Summary
February also has few noteworthy events. The 44th Diet in Japan is a fact concerning Japan, and the Min Wŏn-sik issue in Chosŏn is the main event.

March
Arrest of Students Studying in Japan: Several hundred of our students studying in Tokyo attempted to commemorate March 1st by shouting "Manse!" (Long Live!) at Hibiya Park, and over 70 were arrested by the authorities.
Press Censorship Incident: On March 1st, Tonga Ilbo and "Kaebyŏk" were confiscated.
US Presidential Inauguration Ceremony: The newly appointed US President, Mr. Harding (하-딍), held a grand inauguration ceremony in Washington D.C. (華府) on the 4th.
Arrest of Ōmoto-kyō Leaders: Dozens of leaders of Ōmoto-kyō (大本敎), a somewhat superstitious doctrine neither Buddhist nor Shinto with headquarters in Ayabe (綾府), Japan, including Yamaguchi Ōnisaburō (山口王仁三郞) and Asano Wasaburō (淺野和三郞), were arrested by authorities for lèse-majesté or violation of newspaper laws. This dealt a major blow to Ōmoto-kyō in Japan.
Ch'ŏngnyŏn Founded: On March 10th, the inaugural issue of Ch'ŏngnyŏn (靑年) was published.

Simultaneously, four meritorious subjects, Pak Kyu-su (朴珪壽), Sin Ŭng-jo (申應朝), Yi Ton-u (李敦宇), and Min Yŏng-hwan (閔泳煥), were also enshrined together in the royal shrine court (廟廷). It was held very grandly amidst contemporary government officials and crowds from several groups. <80>
T'aehwa Women's Center Established: Funded by the American Women's Mission Board, the T'aehwa Women's Center (泰和女子館), aimed at women's education, was established in central Kyŏngsŏng.
Pak Chae-hyŏk Sentenced to Death: Pak Chae-hyŏk (朴在赫), who threw a bomb at the Pusan Police Station in August last year, received a death sentence from the High Court on the 31st.

Month's End Summary
This year seems rather uneventful. Or rather, the first half of this year seems uneventful. March also lacks anything that could be called a major event. We have no choice but to move on to April.

April
Britain's Triple Alliance: In Britain, major clashes between authorities and civilians occurred repeatedly due to workers' strikes. Finally, in early April, the Triple Alliance was formed. The leaders of the three factions were Smillie (스마일리), head of the Miners' Federation; Williams (윌리암스), head of the Transport Workers' Federation; and Thomas (도마스), head of the National Union of Railwaymen. Due to this Triple Alliance, Britain fell into great misfortune.
Mr. Sun Wen Elected President: Mr. Sun Wen (孫文) was elected president by a large majority in the Guangzhou government of China. (7th)
Riot in Vladivostok: A major riot broke out in Vladivostok (海港), causing much destruction of buildings and many casualties.

Dr. Starr Visits Chosŏn: American anthropologist Dr. Starr (스타) visited Chosŏn, conducted observations and research on various aspects, and then returned to his country.
Execution of Yi Ch'ang-dŏk: Yi Ch'ang-dŏk (李昌德), an independence activist who shot dead Huch'ang County Magistrate Kye Ŭng-gyu (桂膺奎), was executed at P'yŏngyang Prison on the 22nd.
Working Students' Relief Society Established: The Working Students' Relief Society (苦學生救濟會), which had been managed by Messrs. Yun Ik-sŏn (尹益善), Hong Sun-p'il (洪淳泌), O Chi-yŏng (吳知泳), Ch'oe Tu-sŏn (崔斗善), and others since the previous month, held its inaugural general meeting on the 24th.
Korean Students from Vladivostok Visit Chosŏn: Korean students residing in Russian territory, Yi Kang (李剛), Nam Selge (南셀게), Ch'ae P'eop'an (蔡페오판) <81> and about 10 others, who had long tasted the hardships of foreign lands away from their homeland, came to see the new light of their homeland, to grasp the warm wrists of their brothers, and to introduce what they had learned and gained. Having organized a music troupe, they entered Kyŏngsŏng on the 27th and received a great welcome from various social circles.

Month's End Summary
The event of April worth noting is Britain's Triple Alliance, and the Vladivostok Music Troupe drew much of our public interest.

New German Cabinet: Germany formed a new cabinet, with Mr. Wirth (월드) elected as Chancellor.
Japanese-American Soldiers Clash: On the 22nd, Japanese and American soldiers clashed significantly on the Wusong River (吳淞江) harbor route in Shanghai; the cause was the issue of fault by American soldiers.
All-Chosŏn Football Tournament Held: Hosted by the P'yŏngyang YMCA, it opened at the Sungsil University (崇大) sports ground in P'yŏngyang. Athletes from numerous teams in Kyŏngsŏng and North/South Chosŏn gathered like clouds, presenting a great spectacle, but disputes among two or three teams eventually led to an unfortunate incident.

Month's End Summary
There is nothing worth writing about this month. It seems the world maintained complete silence.

June
Great Dispute at the Medical College: The loss of a single skull from the laboratory became the cause, extending up to the issue of Japanese-Korean national character, eventually leading to a major clash between a teacher named Kubo (久保) and the students, producing the unfortunate incident of study suspension for many days.
Yi P'an-nŭng Incident Occurs: Yi P'an-nŭng (李判能), a Korean who had worked as a driver in the Tokyo Prefecture area for many years, killed or injured 16 Japanese people at dawn on the 3rd due to some emotional issue.
Posŏng College Foundation Established: Posŏng Law and Commerce School (普成法律商業學校), an educational institution in Chosŏn with a long history and high reputation, which had been managed by the Cheondogyo Church (天道敎會) until now, established an incorporated foundation (財團法人) this month this year, setting its foundation for eternity. <82>

Unable to achieve his ambition, he came to stay in Japan, but eventually, unable to overcome his resentment and melancholy, he died by poison in Tokyo on the 14th.
Trial of Boys' Association Members: The independence movement case involving dozens of members of the Chinju Boys' Association (晋州 少年會), including Kang Min-ho (姜敏鎬) and Kim Kyŏng-ho (金敬浩), went to public trial at the Pusan District Court on the 20th, where they received sentences of 1.5 years, 1 year, or 6 months imprisonment.
Boys' Baseball Tournament: On the 27th, the All-Chosŏn Boys' Baseball Tournament was held at the Paejae (培材) sports ground in Kyŏngsŏng. It was initially bustling but ultimately ended without great success.

Month's End Summary
This month concludes with these events. In any case, the first half of the Sinyu year lacked major events. It seems they are all concentrated in the second half. That will be transferred to the next issue. However, depending on circumstances. <83>
<77-83>

**Summary**

This article from the December 1921 issue of *Kaebyŏk* magazine provides a month-by-month retrospective of significant events during the first half of the Sinyu year (January-June 1921). It covers a wide range of topics including political developments (Korean suffrage movements, arrests of independence activists like Pak Chae-hyŏk and An Kyŏng-sin, assassination of Min Wŏn-sik, establishment of the tobacco monopoly), social news (New Year's card statistics, formation of youth and religious groups, student protests, orphanage opening), cultural events (magazine launches, sports tournaments), and international affairs impacting the region (Sino-Japanese relations, US-Japan tensions, Chinese civil strife, post-WWI Europe, British labor unrest). The author notes a relative lack of major global events compared to domestic ones in the first half of the year.

From a historical perspective, the article offers valuable insights into the socio-political climate of colonial Korea in 1921. It highlights the ongoing tension between Japanese colonial rule (censorship of *Kaebyŏk*, arrests, assimilationist education policies) and Korean resistance (independence activities in Korea, Manchuria, and Japan; student activism). The mention of specific individuals, organizations (like the Korean Youth Association Federation, independence groups), incidents (Min Wŏn-sik's assassination, Pusan/P'yŏngyang bombings), and cultural developments (new publications, religious reforms) provides concrete details about life under colonial rule and the multifaceted responses of the Korean people. Historians would find the juxtaposition of local Korean news with regional (China, Japan, Russia) and international events particularly interesting, showing Korea's integration into, and reaction against, global currents during this period.
