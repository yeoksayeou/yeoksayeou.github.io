Chŏng Songgang Ch'ŏl (鄭松江澈) was also skilled in humor (諧謔). During the Imjin War (壬辰之亂), when the Royal Carriage (車駕) was staying in Kisŏng (箕城), Songgang once met with Yu Sŏae Sŏngnyong (柳西厓成龍), Hŏ Akrok Sŏng (許岳麓筬), and Yi P'agok Sŏngjung (李坡谷誠中) and others at Ryŏngwang Pavilion (練光亭).

At that time, from atop the pavilion, they saw enemy fires (賊火) flickering among the pine trees (松樹間) over there and heard the unceasing sound of gunfire (銃聲). Sŏae cried and said, "Our life and death hang in the balance between morning and evening (朝夕에 在한지라); how can we guarantee that this meeting will not be our final parting (永訣)?"

Songgang said, "It is not so. Even if (設又) it were to become like that for us, ultimately (畢竟) we will all return to the same place together, so how could it be called a final parting?"

Sŏae wiped his tears, laughed, and said, "How can there be no affectionate talk (情談) atop Sinjŏng Pavilion (新亭)?" (From Kijae Chapki (寄齋雜記))<107>

**Summary**

This article recounts a historical anecdote from the Imjin War (1592-1598) involving the famed scholar-official Chŏng Ch'ŏl (Songgang) and his colleagues, including Yu Sŏngnyong (Sŏae). While gathered at Ryŏngwang Pavilion in P'yŏngyang during the king's refuge there, they witness signs of the nearby Japanese invasion. Yu Sŏngnyong despairs, fearing their imminent death, but Chŏng Ch'ŏl counters with dark humor, saying even if they die, they will end up together, thus it's not a final parting. Yu Sŏngnyong, moved, references the sentiment of maintaining camaraderie even in crisis, alluding to a classical Chinese story associated with the Sinjŏng Pavilion. For historians, this piece, published in 1921 during Japanese colonial rule, is interesting as it highlights historical Korean resilience, wit, and camaraderie in the face of national crisis (the Imjin War). Its publication could be interpreted as an effort to subtly bolster Korean morale and national identity during another period of hardship by recalling the fortitude of historical figures.

新亭之上에 豈可無情談乎
鄭松江澈이 또한 諧謔에 能하얏다. 壬辰의 亂에 車駕- 箕城에 駐할 새 松江이 일즉 柳西厓成龍과 許岳麓筬과 李坡谷誠中諸人으로 더불어 練光亭에 會하얏다. 그때 亭上에서 멀리 賊火가 저便 松樹間에 明滅하며 銃聲이 不絶함을 듯고 西厓- 울며 가르되 吾輩의 死生이 朝夕에 在한지라 이 會合이 永訣이 아니기를 期必할 수 잇스리요. 松江이 가르되 그러치 안타. 設又 우리가 그리된다 할지라도 畢竟은 다- 가티 한 곳으로 歸할 것이니 어찌 永訣이라 하리요. 西厓- 눈물을 씻으며 웃어 가르되 新亭의 上에 어찌 可히 情談이 업스리요.(寄齋雜記에서)＜107＞
