I Went and Saw Ch'ü Yüan

Yŏng T'ae (永泰), a *Changsangnang* (將仕郞) official of Koryŏ (高麗), once went out hunting following King Ch'unghye (忠惠王). As a joke, the King threw T'ae into the water. After a while, T'ae emerged, pushing through the water. The King laughed and asked, "Where did you go just now, and where have you come from?" "Yes, I went and saw Ch'ü Yüan (屈原)." "What did Ch'ü Yüan say when you saw him?" "He said, 'I was unfortunate to meet a benighted ruler and was thrown into the river to die, but you have met an enlightened ruler, so many good things will happen to you.'" The King said, "Well spoken!" and bestowed upon him a set of silver bowls. <83>

**Summary**

This short article recounts an anecdote from the Koryŏ dynasty. An official named Yŏng T'ae is playfully thrown into the water by King Ch'unghye during a hunt. Upon emerging, Yŏng T'ae claims to have met the ancient Chinese poet Ch'ü Yüan in the water. He cleverly uses this imaginary encounter to flatter the King, contrasting the "benighted ruler" Ch'ü Yüan served with the "enlightened ruler" King Ch'unghye, earning a reward. For historians, this piece, published in 1921 under Japanese rule, might be interesting as a possible form of subtle commentary or allegory. Recounting a historical story involving flattery towards a Korean king could be interpreted in various ways within the context of colonial suppression – perhaps as a reminder of past sovereignty, a veiled critique of collaboration, or simply a piece of historical trivia meant to entertain without overtly challenging the authorities.
