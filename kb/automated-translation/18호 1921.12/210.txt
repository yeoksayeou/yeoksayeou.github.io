Come, Winter Rain!
						Kim Sŏk-song

For rain to fall
so much in winter
is truly an exceptional thing
For me to walk
this path like this
is truly an extraordinary thing

My whole body
is like a drowned rat
Water overflows from my *kat* brim<119>
The double-layered padded clothes
can be wrung out
Water has thoroughly soaked
into the high leather shoes,
squishing and sloshing
Sweat wraps my whole body,
and my legs find each step difficult
Still, I
walk on without rest

Water has risen on the stream bank
that was dry even this morning
The winter rain pours down steadily,
like the monsoon rains

Come, winter rain!
Come as much as you like
Come even with snow, even with wind
Still, I
have no fear at all
And I am happy
I will go on without rest
Because—
Far away... over there
my beloved anxiously waits,
worrying for my safety...<120>
<119-120>

**Summary**

This poem by Kim Sŏk-song describes the speaker's arduous journey through an unseasonably heavy winter rain. Despite being completely soaked and finding walking difficult, the speaker expresses determination and even joy, driven onward by the thought of a loved one anxiously waiting and worrying far away. The poem highlights themes of perseverance against adversity and the motivating power of love or connection. From a historical perspective, the poem, written during the Japanese colonial period, could be interpreted metaphorically. The harsh winter rain might symbolize the oppressive colonial reality, while the speaker's unwavering journey towards the waiting beloved could represent resilience, hope, and the enduring spirit of the Korean people striving towards a desired future or reunion, despite the suffering. The raw emotional intensity and focus on overcoming hardship would likely resonate with contemporary readers facing difficult circumstances.

오너라 겨을비!
						金石松
겨을에 비가
이러케 만히 옴은
참 例外의 일이다
내가 이 길을
이러케 거러감은
참 非常한 일이다

나의 全身은
물에 빠진 쥐갓다
갓냥에 물이 넘치고＜119＞
두벌 껴입은 핫옷이
쥐어짜게 되엇다
목달이 가죽신은
속속들이 물이 배어서
질컥 벌컥한다
땀은 온몸을 말고,
다리는 寸步가 어렵다
그래도 나는
쉬지안코 거러간다

午前까지도 말랏던
내ㅅ둑에는 물이 낫다
겨을비는 장마와 가티
꾸준히 퍼붓는다

오너라 겨을비!
얼마던지 오너라
눈까지 바람까지 오너라
그래도 나는
아모 두려움도 업다
그리고 나는 깃브다
쉬지안코 가겟다
그것은-
멀리... 저곳에서
님이 苦待함으로
나의 安否를 걱정함으로...＜120＞
＜119-120＞
