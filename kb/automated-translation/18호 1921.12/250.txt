Aspects of Autumn Colors
						Sin Kŭnp'o

As soon as my weary body, which sought rest in a short sleep, awoke,
To the sound of the wind blowing desolately (蕭蕭히),
I knew! The leaves of the tall pines were shaking and fluttering.

In city life, where one only knows summer when it's hot
And winter when it's cold,
To boldly break away and encounter this—
I was a little late again, and so,
Filling my whole body with curiosity (好奇) and joy (歡喜),
I cheerfully (快然히) arose and went up the back mountain, just kept going.

Whether my line of sight was short or my field of vision (眼界) narrow,
Wherever I looked, in all the myriad things (森羅萬象),
Even the pines, said to be green through four seasons, eternal spring (四時長春), had shed their cotyledons (떡닙).
Ah—I thought perhaps that was the different country (別國) of the oriole (黃鸝).

To the right, sitting far off, whispering of the dust of ages (萬古風塵),
The black mountain, Pugak (北岳), like a burnt-out tall tree (喬木),
Had only imposing cliffs (岩壁) amidst the thick, cold misty air (煙氣).
And on the many small and large mountains, layered in all eight directions (八方에 疊疊한),
Between the sparsely and randomly standing pine trees,
Only unsightly sand and gravel (砂石) lay piled deep (잠북히),
Creating a desolate winter scene (境界) out of season.

Dreaming of a fairyland (仙境) amidst the complex red dust (複雜한 紅塵),
By chance, utter chance, having reached this long-cherished desire (宿望)
—I, of the mundane world (世俗), starved for natural beauty (自然美)—
How many times did I scoff at and feel
The emptiness (荒虛함) of the dusty world (塵世) and the teeming (蠢爾하는) human life?

But then again, but then again,
I realized that autumn is the sequence (循次) following warm spring,
And yellow (黃) is the preparation (預備) awaiting blue/green (靑).
Also, the imposing cliff walls (壁巖) and desolate sand and gravel (砂石)
Will, in the future (장차) ideal land (理想鄕),
Become the embroidered brocade (錦繡) that adds color (彩色)—
I fully realized (깨달앗다) they possessed ample potential (資質) as its precursor (前身).<136>

Ah—autumn—autumn!! Fresh autumn!
Autumn that gives the hundred grains (百穀), life (生命) to the masses (衆民)!
Autumn of encouraging virtue (勸善), drawing distant lamps (燈火) close to make them familiar (親케)!
Autumn that gives the strength to strive (奮鬪) to the weak bodies of the common people (蒼生)!
Ah! Autumn! Autumn!! Autumn of prosperity (繁榮)!

Autumn full of hope (希望), courageous autumn,
Let my withered (枯焦한) body walk together with you! <137>

**Summary**

The poem "Aspects of Autumn Colors" by Sin Kŭnp'o begins with the speaker escaping the monotonous city to experience autumn in the mountains. Initially struck by the desolate beauty – the wind, the changing colors even on pines, the stark cliffs of Pugak, and gravelly slopes – the speaker contrasts this natural scene with the emptiness of worldly life. However, the poem shifts tone, reinterpreting autumn not as an end but as a necessary stage preceding renewal (spring/green). The desolate elements are seen as precursors to future beauty. The final stanzas praise autumn enthusiastically as a season of life-giving harvest, virtue, strength, and prosperity, concluding with a desire to walk alongside this hopeful, courageous season. From a historical perspective, written in 1921 during Japanese rule, the poem's strong emphasis on autumn as a source of life, strength for the masses (衆民), and future prosperity (繁榮), despite its initial melancholic or desolate appearance, could be interpreted as a subtle expression of national resilience and hope for Korea's future revival. The transition from perceived desolation to inherent potential and eventual prosperity mirrors a potential desire for national restoration.

秋色의 景相
						辛槿圃
짤은 잠에 쉬우랴던 困한 몸이 깨자마자
蕭蕭히 불어가는 바람소리에
알앗다! 놉히 선 松葉이 흔들려 나부낌을.

더우면 여름이오 추우면 겨을로만
알고 지나는 都市의 生活에서
奮然히 뛰어나와 이를 맛나기
다시 좀 느젓는데 그래서 나는
好奇와 歡喜에 全身을 담아
快然히 일어나 뒤ㅅ山으로 올라갓다 자꾸만.

視線이 짤랏는지 眼界가 좁앗는지
보이는 곳 보는 곳 森羅한 萬象에
四時長春 푸르다는 솔조차 떡닙지니
아- 그것이 黃鸝의 別國인가 하얏다.

바른 편에 멀리 안저 萬古風塵 속사기는
타고 남은 喬木가튼 검은 山 北岳에는
자욱한 찬 煙氣에 岩壁만 충충하고
八方에 疊疊한 작고 큰 만흔 山에
드믈게 함부로 선 소나무의 사이로는
보기실흔 砂石만 잠북히 늘어서
때아닌 겨을 境界 쓸쓸히도 이뤗섯다.

複雜한 紅塵에서 仙境을 꿈꾸다가
偶然에도 偶然하게 宿望인이에 이른
- 自然美에 줄린 世俗의 나는-
塵世의 荒虛함과 蠢爾하는 人生을
비웃고 느끼기 기몃번쯤 햇다.

그러나 다시 그러나 다시
가을은 따뜻한 봄뵈자는 循次이며
黃은 靑을 기대리는 預備임을 알앗섯다.
또한 충충한 壁巖과 쓸쓸한 砂石은
장차을 理想鄕에
彩色을 도아줄 바 錦繡의 前身됨에
넉넉한 資質뵘을 充分히 깨달앗다.＜136＞

아- 가을- 가을!! 新鮮한 가을!
衆民에게 生命되는 百穀을 주는 가을!
멀어진 燈火를 끄을어 親케 하는 勸善의 가을!
蒼生의 弱한 몸에 奮鬪할 힘주는 가을!
아! 가을! 가을!! 繁榮의 가을!

希望에 무르녹은 勇氣잇는 가을아
枯焦한 나의 몸도 너와 한끠 걸(步)ㅅ자구나!＜137＞
＜136-137＞
