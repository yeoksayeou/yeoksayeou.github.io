Poem 1
The overturning tide of wind flows west and then east,
All living beings are amidst floating and sinking.
On the day the wind stops and the waves calm in great peace,
May the sentiment of mutual prosperity for you and me be shared.

Poem 2
The days of world peace are slow in coming,
The reporting pens of all nations ought to provide awakening.
Great East's *Kaebyŏk* (개벽 - Opening) emerges responding to the times,
Why should advancing forward be hindered by dangers or ease (*險夷*)?

Poem 3
The great conference is publicly scheduled for a set date,
Journalists from Our East (我東 - Korea) will also participate (*叅其*).
Public discourse and righteous debate shall protect humaneness,
It is truly an opportunity for the strong and weak to be made equal. <143>

**Summary**

This three-part poem, written in *Hansi* style by Min Sŏk-kye, expresses excitement and hope upon hearing that Kim Ki-ch'ŏn, representing the influential Korean magazine *Kaebyŏk*, was recommended for membership in a World Journalists Conference. The poem reflects on the turbulent global situation, emphasizes the role of journalism in promoting peace and awakening, celebrates the participation of a Korean journalist on the world stage, and views the conference as a chance to advocate for justice, humaneness, and equality between nations. For historians, the article reveals Korean intellectuals' engagement with international discourse and their aspirations for national recognition and equality during the colonial period. The emphasis on journalism's role and the hope placed in international forums like this conference highlight strategies used to navigate and challenge the constraints of colonial rule.
