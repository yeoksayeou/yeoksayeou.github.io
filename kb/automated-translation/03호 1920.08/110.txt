The Honorable Ch'ungdal, Master Kim Ok-kyun

In these recent days when individualism and democracy are widely discussed, talk of heroes might seem outdated. However, it doesn't seem quite so, and the call demanding heroes (hereafter referred to as "great men") seems to be growing louder from all directions. It appears that great men cannot be entirely excluded, no matter what. Generally, a great man is a leader of humanity, presenting a model or standard—in other words, a kind of creator—of what the general populace must ultimately achieve or reach. The quality and substance of a nation or people are weighted by their presence or absence, and the common people gain inspiration and recognize enlightenment by approaching and looking up to them. How sorrowful and heart-wrenching would it be if a people had no such great men in their history, or even if they had them, if the people themselves buried and failed to discover them? Today, we strongly demand the appearance of great men. We wish we could even encounter their shadows. However, the general public has not yet discovered them. It's not that there are no ordinary great men in the world, but it is too dissatisfying to make them the target of our admiration. How fortunate would it be if we could discover among our compatriots a great man particularly suited to be our model today? Now, we dare to introduce Master Kim Ok-kyun—the greatest product of modern Korea, whom a part of us has denigrated, washed away, buried, and pretended to forget—no, a world-class great man. Whether this account is complete or incomplete, the writer takes responsibility. Brothers, let us first, with our own sacred silence and fervent feeling, contemplate deeply and passionately upon Master Kim's holy traces and great character.

[Portrait of Kim Ok-kyun]

Master Kim's Birth and Official Career

69 years ago from now, on the 23rd day of the first lunar month of the Sinhae year (1851), in Ch'ungch'ŏngnam-do, Ch'ŏnan, within a certain family of the Andong Kim clan, a fragrant baby let out its first cry. His father, loving his clear and handsome features like jade, thus bestowed upon him the name Ok-kyun.<41> According to reliable accounts, he could understand speech at age 2, could converse with his parents at age 3, and the affection of the entire family was focused solely on him. When he reached 6 or 7 years old and began interacting with neighborhood children, his affection for his peers, even as a young child, was exceptionally deep. Even a single amusing word from him was full of flavor and warmth, so the children and youths of the vicinity reportedly flocked to him, and his doorstep was always bustling like a marketplace. His genius for dealing with people was evident from childhood.

The exact year is unrecorded (likely around age 10), but Master Kim left his hometown in Ch'ŏnan and became the adopted son of former county magistrate Kim Pyŏng-gi in Hwagae-dong, Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul), thereby becoming a resident of Kyŏngsŏng. The current site of Kyŏngsŏng High Normal School in Hyŏndong is said to be where Master Kim's residence was located then. Having moved to Kyŏngsŏng, Master Kim studied classical Chinese under the guidance of his adoptive parents. His brilliant talent manifested everywhere; shortly after beginning his studies, he excelled in poetry and prose, and was also skilled in calligraphy, leaving viewers and listeners utterly astonished. Barely having reached adulthood (弱冠, yakgwan - around age 20), he took the civil service examination, hitting the first target of the Dragon Gate (passing the exam), and subsequently won the glorious crown of the Okdang (Hongmungwan, Office of Special Advisors), his literary fame shaking the era. Master Kim was no longer an ordinary man of Hwagae-dong. Where peach and plum trees bloom, paths form naturally; where the dragon appears in the field, clouds and rain inevitably follow. How could Master Kim's greatness stop there? Eventually, he came to the attention of the great hero of the time, the Daewon'gun (Grand Prince Regent), and leaped to the important position of Vice Minister of Personnel (吏曹叅議, Ijo Ch'amŭi). He was truly only 19 years old at the time—even considering the circumstances where one person's rise or fall could be decided by the favor or disfavor of another, isn't this truly astonishing? Master Kim subsequently advanced through the ranks, serving as Vice Minister of Personnel (吏曹叅判, Ijo Ch'amp'an), and at the age of 26, he wore the seal of the Minister of Finance (戶曹判書, Hojo P'ansŏ).

The Chaos of Korean Politics and Master Kim's Rise

In any society, there are always currents flowing. Those who clearly perceive the shifts in these currents and adapt to ride them at the opportune moment will prosper and flourish, while those who fail to do so will wither and perish. Pondering this, the eastward surge of European and American power in the latter half of the 19th century was a great tide—no, a great deluge—for the people of the East. Consider this: how many nations drifted away and peoples were replaced due to this deluge? Fortunately, Japan rode this tide to accomplish the great work of the Meiji Restoration. China hesitated indecisively, suffering national shame and humiliation, its territory shrinking. Unfortunately, our Korea completely failed to ride the tide, ultimately leading to its annexation by Japan. Esteemed readers, this is the writer's earnest plea: even if it feels somewhat digressive, allow me to briefly outline the measures taken by the authorities at the time regarding this tide since the Kapsin year (1884), leading up to the great deeds of Master Kim Ok-kyun.<42>

First, when King Ch'ŏlchong passed away without an heir, 57 years ago in the Kyehae year (1863), the son of Prince Hŭngsŏn (*) was enthroned. As he was only 12 years old, Prince Hŭngsŏn became the Daewon'gun (Grand Prince Regent) and took charge of state affairs. The Daewon'gun was high-spirited and decisive, possessing the qualities of a hero, but regrettably lacked foresight, making his rule akin to a stubborn child wielding a sharp knife. His obstinate mind first clung fiercely to isolationism. He began by brutally persecuting Catholics. In the Pyŏngin year (1866), he killed French missionaries, leading to an attack on Kanghwa Island by seven French warships, which he repelled. In the Kyŏngo year (1870), when an American merchant ship sailed up the Taedong River, he had the entire crew killed. Consequently, five American warships later advanced up the Han River, and he repelled them as well. What were called the French and American forces at that time came merely for accountability or trade purposes, definitely not for battle. It can be inferred by anyone how minimal their troop numbers and weaponry preparations must have been. To call these incidents the Pyŏngin Yangyo (Western Disturbance) and make a national commotion is truly laughable. Having repelled them, the Daewon'gun, acting as if he had defeated the entire armies of America and France, became increasingly arrogant and disdainful of foreigners day by day. Prior to this, in the 9th month of the Musin year (1868, Meiji 1), Japan sent Sō Shigemasa, the administrator of Tsushima Island, to announce the restoration of imperial rule and request the establishment of diplomatic relations. Seeing the title "Great Japanese Emperor" (大日本皇帝) in the state letter, the Daewon'gun declared, "Only China may use the imperial title; how dare Japan use it?" and refused to accept the letter. Subsequently, he abolished meetings between Japanese and Korean officials in Tongnae and Pusan. This led to discussions of conquering Korea (征韓論, Seikanron) arising in the Japanese court. Later, in the Ŭrhae year (1875), the Japanese warship Un'yō, while surveying our coast and areas like Niuzhuang in China, passed Wŏlmi Island near Inch'ŏn. While anchored in Kanghwa Bay and sending a small boat up the Han River, the batteries of Yŏngjong Fortress suddenly opened fire. The Un'yō returned fire, captured Yŏngjong Fortress, and reported back to Tokyo. Consequently (in February of the following year), Japan's Kuroda Kiyotaka came to Kyŏngsŏng as a plenipotentiary ambassador. He condemned the discourtesy of the earlier refusal of the state letter and the firing on the warship, demanding the conclusion of a treaty of amity. The Daewon'gun's opposition remained fierce, causing turmoil in the court deliberations. However, at this time, the Minister of the Right, Pak Kyu-su, and 7 or 8 others pushed aside the dissenting opinions, forcefully arguing for the benefits of opening the country, leading to the conclusion of the Korea-Japan Treaty of Amity, known as the Treaty of Kanghwa. Through this treaty, Korea was recognized as an independent and sovereign nation with equal rights to Japan, severing the traditional tributary relationship with China. It was agreed to open the two ports of Wŏnsan and Inch'ŏn for trade (Wŏnsan opened in Kyŏngjin year [1880], Inch'ŏn in Kyŏngin year [1882]) and to permit free surveying of the peninsula's coast by the Japanese.

The conclusion of this Treaty of Kanghwa was indeed like dropping a bombshell into the political sea of Korea at the time. That is, the victory of Pak Kyu-su's side, which advocated for the benefits of opening the country,<43> signified the decline of the Daewon'gun's faction, which had stubbornly clung to isolationism, rejecting the West and Japan. The political situation, which previously knew only of Korea and China and no other countries, and only the policy of isolation and wielding power, suddenly became aware that besides Korea and China, there were Japan and other foreign nations, and besides isolationism, there was an urgent need for opening doors and establishing new governance. The clause recognizing Korea as a sovereign nation with equal rights to Japan ignited issues with China, to which Korea had until yesterday paid tribute according to the Chinese calendar (正朔, chŏngsak). The political arena in Hansŏng (Seoul), which had operated arbitrarily whether doing well or poorly, gradually became a stage for rivalry between Japanese and Chinese influences.

At the time this Treaty of Kanghwa was concluded, Master Kim was already 26 and held the prominent position of Minister of Finance. Faced with such a situation, anyone with eyes and ears would not feel complacent. How much more so for Master Kim, who possessed god-like intelligence, seeing the formless and hearing the soundless? Having stood for many years amidst the turbulent currents of officialdom, lamenting the disgraceful conduct of corrupt officials and the decline of public morals, his mind was already poised for a turn. Master Kim thus rose up resolutely, leaped forth energetically, and took it upon himself to be the foremost figure in building a new Korea. He cried out desperately for the need to first achieve enlightenment, politically and socially. To do so, rather than joining hands with China, still deeply intoxicated by its 5,000-year dream, the most effective and quickest path was to link arms with Japan, which was amidst its energetic pursuit of Restoration, and seek knowledge from the world. Thus, during the aforementioned Kanghwa Incident, he joined Pak Kyu-su in advocating for the benefits of opening the country. With the conclusion of the Treaty of Kanghwa, the power of the Daewon'gun faction, the conservative side, gradually waned. Seeing this as an opportune moment, Master Kim devoted even greater effort to propagating the principles of enlightenment and uniting comrades, eventually earning the designation of the Enlightenment Party (開化黨, Kaehwadang).

In the spring of the Sinsa year (1881), 39 years ago (Master Kim was 31), believing the realization of his long-held aspirations needed to be hastened even by a day, he took the first step. Consulting with the authorities of the time, under the guise of "Touring Court Officials" (遊覽朝士, Yuram Chosa), he, along with Sŏ Kwang-bŏm, Yu Kil-chun, and over ten other prominent figures from court and country (all enlightenment advocates), traveled to Japan to personally observe its Restoration policies. Upon returning, he championed progressive principles with renewed vigor. At this time, seizing the opportunity presented by rumors of the Daewon'gun's plot to depose the current king, he vigorously pushed back against the conservative faction and strove for direct royal rule. He established a military academy at the site of the Hullyeonwon (Military Training Command), now the location of Tongdaemun Elementary School, hired a Japanese Army Lieutenant, Horimoto Reizō, to train new troops, and planned for the modernization of state affairs in various other aspects. At this point, the Daewon'gun had been forced into political retirement. Discontented, resentful that national opinion seemed to lean towards Japan, that his allies were pushed out of court, and that the Min clan held autocratic power, he secretly gathered his supporters, plotting to regain influence. The following year, the Imo Military Mutiny<44> (壬午軍亂, Imogunran - refer to the article titled "Fifty Years in Thirty Days" in this magazine) erupted. The Daewon'gun incited the mutinous soldiers to kill Lieutenant Horimoto and attack the Japanese legation. Simultaneously, he invaded the royal palace, killed Prime Minister Yi Ch'oe-ŭng, seized political power himself, and thus restored his influence. Subsequently, regarding this incident, both China and Japan dispatched troops to discuss countermeasures. With the intention of valuing diplomatic ties between China and Japan, China's Li Hongzhang ordered Ma Jianzhong (馬公使), the minister stationed in Kyŏngsŏng, to arrest the Daewon'gun and detain him in Tianjin. Amidst the changed atmosphere following this turn of events, the Treaty of Chemulp'o was concluded as a gesture of amity between Korea and Japan, bringing the situation to a close. As part of the implementation of this treaty, in October of the same year, the government dispatched Pak Yŏng-hyo and Kim Man-sik to Japan as envoys of apology. Master Kim joined this delegation, traveling to Japan for a second time. Although Pak Yŏng-hyo, Kim Man-sik, and others returned directly to Korea after completing their mission, Master Kim remained in Japan to study the administration of the Meiji Restoration in detail. Meanwhile, coordinating with comrades back home, he plotted for the reform of national governance. He recommended the Japanese nationals Ushiba Takuzō (牛場卓造) and Inoue Kakugorō (井上角五郞) to serve as government advisors. He also rallied comrades to form the Independence Party (獨立黨, Tongniptang). Furthermore, as conditions for friendship between Korea and Japan, he presented proposals to the Korean government for the implementation of existing treaties and the dispatch of students abroad. Eventually gaining approval from both the court and the public, the stationing of Japanese troops in Kyŏngsŏng to guard the legation began. Dozens of students, including Yu Hyŏk-ro, Sŏ Chae-p'il, Yu Sŏng-jun, Yi Kyu-wan, Sin Ŭng-hŭi, Chŏng Nan-kyo, and Cho Pyŏng-kyo, appeared in Tokyo – this marked the very beginning of Korean students studying abroad. Master Kim, feeling no further need to stay longer in Japan, sought some funds in preparation for future endeavors and then returned home.

Destiny!! Destiny!! Master Kim's Two-Day Cabinet

While Master Kim gathered enlightenment advocates to form the Independence Party, the conservative faction, centered around the Min clan, formed the Conservative Party (守舊黨, Sugudang). Seeing the emergence of these two parties at the time, the animosity between them was self-evident. Moreover, after the Imo Military Mutiny, the Chinese government, observing that the Independence Party faction led by Master Kim leaned towards Japan and that Japan's influence in Korea was growing daily, also decided to interfere in internal affairs. Li Hongzhang dispatched Chen Shutang (陳樹棠), the Superintendent of Trade, and the German Paul Georg von Möllendorff (穆麟德) to serve as advisors. He appointed Yuan Shikai (袁世凱) as the Plenipotentiary Commissioner stationed in Korea, garrisoning him in Kyŏngsŏng with 2,000 troops. Yuan, though only 24 at the time, possessed cunning and skill far exceeding others. He adeptly manipulated the foreign ministers and skillfully controlled the conservative faction, greatly establishing his influence in the court and obstructing the Independence Party's efforts in myriad ways. Even the resourceful Master Kim found no immediate room to maneuver. However, at this time (Kapsin year, 1884), China became embroiled with France over the Annam (Vietnam) issue (*conflict*), leading to the eastward dispatch of the French fleet. As China's attention to the Korean problem lessened,<45> Japan's policy towards Korea also suddenly changed, showing willingness to support the Enlightenment Party. Furthermore, the minister stationed in Kyŏngsŏng, Takezoe Shin'ichirō (竹添進一郞), separately indicated his intention to support the Independence Party. Master Kim, deeming this an opportunity not to be missed, immediately began preparations for action. The plan was as follows: The Kyŏngsŏng Post Office had just been completed, and a grand opening banquet was scheduled for 9 PM on December 4th. On that night, not only high officials from all parties but also foreign ministers were expected to attend. The plan was to use this opportunity to eliminate the high-ranking officials of the conservative faction, whether present at the banquet or at home, in one fell swoop. Dozens of sacks filled with sawdust were prepared and piled inside the main hall of a detached palace (別宮正殿). Oil was poured on them to be set alight. Separately, explosives were placed nearby. As the fire spread, the explosion would serve as a military signal for assassins (壯士) to act—this was the arrangement.

December 4th! The day that would decide Master Kim's lifelong destiny—no, the day that would determine whether a new Korea could be established—arrived. It arrived exactly according to Master Kim's secret arrangements. In the grand hall of the newly built Post Office, foreign envoys and members of the conservative faction, starting with Min Yŏng-ik, were all present as planned. When the banquet was halfway through, and the conversation between hosts and guests was at its liveliest, Master Kim used a secret signal to ignite the explosives placed in the detached palace multiple times, but for some reason, there was no response. Left with no choice, he had a fire set in a neighboring house. As fierce flames shot through the glass windows of the Post Office, shouts arose from outside that the palace was on fire. Everyone present rushed out chaotically. Among them, Min Yŏng-ik, pale and terrified, dashed out first. Waiting assassins swiftly intercepted him, but skillfully missed their mark. Min fled back inside the building, and the assassins hid themselves again. Inside the Post Office, some were crying, some raving, some fleeing – it was a scene of utter pandemonium (修羅場, surajang). Minister Takezoe, who had a prior agreement, led troops to guard the palace gates. Master Kim, along with Pak Yŏng-hyo, rushed to the palace, reported that rebellious soldiers were causing trouble, and, under urgent royal command, summoned key figures of the conservative faction—Rear Capital Division Commander Yun T'ae-jun, Minister of Personnel Cho Yŏng-ha, Front Capital Division Commander Han Kyu-jik, Left Guard Commander Yi Cho-yŏn, as well as Min Yŏng-mok and Min T'ae-ho—to the palace, ambushing and killing them en route. With this, the conservative party was virtually eliminated, and the era of the Enlightenment Party began. The next day, a new cabinet was formed. Master Kim, Pak Yŏng-hyo, Hong Yŏng-sik, and other leaders of the Enlightenment Party largely joined the cabinet, undertaking a complete renewal of state affairs. First, a grand decree was issued, proclaiming the overhaul of governance. Then, corrupt officials were purged, the hereditary status system (門閥, munbŏl) was abolished, the power of eunuchs was stripped, the ritual of paying tribute [to China] was stopped, taxes were reformed, and other new systems of civilization were planned for implementation. Thus, Master Kim's long-cherished ambitions took their first step towards realization. Had they proceeded at this pace, within a year, the landscape of the peninsula<46> would have been transformed, all institutions reformed, and the modernization of Korea achieved. Alas! The new cabinet was established just yesterday, yet the ominous sound of gunfire from the east of the palace—what misfortune is this? On the night of the 2nd, the Min Yŏng-ik family, having narrowly escaped, immediately requested Yuan Shikai's help. Yuan led his 2,000 troops and surrounded the palace. Minister Takezoe's troops engaged them but were outnumbered and showed signs of defeat early on. Master Kim supported the King, heading towards the north gate of the palace. Entering the woods, he set up a makeshift throne with woolen cloth (布毛) and, weeping profusely, implored the King about the global situation and Korea's future. As an immediate measure, he strongly urged evacuation to Inch'ŏn to plan the next steps. However, at that time, Queen Min, along with the Min clan, was with Yuan's forces. Moreover, knowing that Japanese power could not be relied upon, the King rejected Master Kim's plea and privately fled to Yuan Shikai's camp. Minister Takezoe, with his small contingent of soldiers and having lost the justification of guarding the King in the palace, was forced to withdraw from Kyŏngsŏng. Thereupon, Master Kim, under the protection of Japanese soldiers, barely reached the legation. He personally cut off his topknot (髮) quickly, threw it into the stove (暖爐), put on Japanese clothes, and then, along with Minister Takezoe, fled to Inch'ŏn. They immediately boarded a steamship bound for Shimonoseki. Amidst sorrow, indignation, and frustration, the ship weighed anchor from Inch'ŏn. Traveling with him at that time were Pak Yŏng-hyo, Sŏ Kwang-bŏm, and Sŏ Chae-p'il, who had conspired with Master Kim in this great undertaking. Meanwhile, the political strategy in Hansŏng, having driven out Master Kim, was now dominated by the Conservative Party. Sim Sun-t'aek became Prime Minister, and Hong Yŏng-sik and other Enlightenment Party members remaining in Kyŏngsŏng, along with their families, were entirely exterminated.

Exile to Japan—A Life of Hardship and Bitterness

Even amidst the chaos and defeat, Master Kim harbored the ambition of returning to fight again (捲土重來, kwŏnt'ojungnae) and arrived in Tokyo via Shimonoseki. At that time, the Japanese government blamed Minister Takezoe for his rash actions, and its attitude suddenly changed. The treatment afforded to Master Kim became extremely cold. Figures like Foreign Minister Inoue Kaoru (井上馨 - inferred, as the text says 井上外務大臣) repeatedly refused even a single meeting despite Master Kim's visits. Master Kim must have been indignant at Japan's betrayal on more than one or two occasions. Meanwhile, the three men, Pak Yŏng-hyo, Sŏ Kwang-bŏm, and Sŏ Chae-p'il, traveled further to the United States shortly after arriving in Japan. While Master Kim remained alone, Pak soon returned to Tokyo and lived with him. Learning of this, the Korean court, formed by the Conservative Party, worried about Kim and Pak plotting again. In the Ŭryu year (1885), Sŏ Sang-u and Möllendorff were sent to Japan as envoys of apology, carrying a state letter, and simultaneously demanded the repatriation of Master Kim and others of his faction to Korea. However, the Japanese government refused, arguing that there was no extradition treaty for criminals between Korea and Japan, and furthermore, political offenders are not extradited under international law. The following year, Pyŏngsul (1886), the Conservative Party secretly dispatched an assassin, Chi Un-yŏng (池運永), to Japan to assassinate Master Kim. Fortunately, a fellow Korean secretly informed Master Kim of this. Master Kim's friends immediately reported it to the Japanese government.<47> The government instructed the Japanese minister stationed in Kyŏngsŏng: "Japan will expel Kim from its territory, so recall the assassin." The conservative side agreed to this and recalled Chi Un-yŏng. At that time, Pak [Yŏng-hyo] conspired again with Japanese individuals like Ōi Kentarō (大井憲太郞) and Kobayashi Kusuo (小林樟雄) to overthrow the Korean government. When the plot was exposed, the conservative side felt increasingly uneasy and pressed harder for the expulsion of Master Kim's faction. The Japanese government finally exiled Master Kim to the Ogasawara Islands. This was a remote, isolated island with sparse population and particularly harsh miasma (瘴癘). Within a few months of arriving, Master Kim's health deteriorated significantly. His emaciated figure groaning by the island shore—viewers and listeners could not help but shed hot tears. Later, having gained the understanding of the Japanese authorities, he briefly returned to Tokyo. However, for some reason, Master Kim received another order to relocate, this time to Hokkaido. Laboriously dragging his sick body, he arrived on the island. But how could this foreign land, thousands of miles away, with different language, customs, and even a drastically different climate, be a place where Master Kim could endure living? Furthermore, the monthly living expense of 100 yen, which the Japanese government had provided out of goodwill, was gradually reduced to 75 yen, then further cut to 50 yen, and then to 17 yen, until finally, even that payment was stopped. Friends in Tokyo deeply lamented this and campaigned in various ways for Master Kim's release, but achieved no effect. They merely collected some money, like monthly contributions from a friendship association, and sent it to barely provide for Master Kim's daily meals. He spent about six long years burning with anxiety in this miserable life. Around the Sinmyo year (1891), having finally managed to return to Tokyo, Master Kim's complexion was merely haggard, and his short hair was sparse and white (蕭蕭). His elegant demeanor of earlier years was nowhere to be found, and anyone could recognize the look of frustration and misfortune (轗軻不遇, kanga bul'u). However, his single-minded devotion (一片丹心, ilp'yŏndansim) to build a new Korea and create happiness for the twenty million people, advancing fiercely, had not weakened in the slightest. He plotted with Pak [Yŏng-hyo] for a comeback. The conservative faction, detecting this opportunity, dispatched another assassin, Yi Il-chik (李逸稙), in the Imjin year (1892), intending to assassinate both Master Kim and Pak. Yi went to Japan under the guise of engaging in commerce and waited for a chance to strike Master Kim. Meanwhile, he encountered Hong Chong-u (洪鍾宇), who was returning from France. Seeing that Hong's eloquence and intelligence were useful, Yi swayed him with threats and temptations of rewards. Hong eventually committed himself, pledging unwavering loyalty to Yi. Through Yi's clever introduction, Hong managed to meet Master Kim and Pak. Although Hong had become a villain plotting against Master Kim due to Yi's wicked persuasion, he possessed the air of a great man. Having traveled extensively in Europe and America, his words and actions were noteworthy. When discussing current affairs passionately, his statesmanship overflowed, showing he was capable of great deeds. Master Kim gradually allowed him closer access. However, after a short while, Kim noticed his behavior becoming quite strange and harbored some suspicion. Meanwhile, someone informed Kim of Hong's plot. While taking full precautions,<48> the audacious Master Kim showed no outward sign of this and continued associating with him as before. However, Hong realized that Japan was ultimately not the place to carry out his plot. He negotiated with the conservative faction back home, deciding to lure Master Kim to another country somehow and execute the plan there. One day, he visited Master Kim and forcefully argued, "The revolution in our homeland cannot achieve its goal through your efforts alone. I spent 14 years in China and have close ties with Li Hongzhang's son, Li Jingfang (李經芳). If we obtain his introduction and plot this great undertaking with Li Hongzhang, we will surely achieve our objective." Master Kim was half-believing, half-doubting. A few days later, a letter arrived from Yanjing (Beijing). It was from Li Jingfang, echoing Hong's proposal. This stemmed from a treacherous scheme between Yuan Shikai, then stationed in Kyŏngsŏng, and Li Hongzhang to lure Master Kim. Although Master Kim was not entirely unaware of this possibility, time was passing idly (悾憁), opportunities were receding, and simply remaining adrift like this in a corner of the vast ocean with no hope in sight was unbearable for him. Furthermore, trusting in Li Hongzhang's character to some extent, he firmly decided to head for China. His intention was to use the father and son, Li, to achieve in the West (西楡, Sŏyu - referring to China) the ambition he had lost in the land of the rising sun (扶桑, Pusang - referring to Japan). Learning of this plan, his various friends warned him vehemently about the dangers of going to China—specifically, falling into Li's treacherous trap—and tried to stop his departure. But Master Kim refused, saying, "If Li Hongzhang is truly a great man, he would not commit such a base act as killing me to achieve his ends. Even if this trip is indeed his treacherous plot, in today's East Asia, having already failed in Japan, if I also distrust China, where else is there for me to go? I must simply enter the tiger's den..." With these few words, he brushed off their concerns. In the spring of the Kapo year (1894), on March 10th, under the pretext of traveling to the Kyoto-Osaka (京坂, Keihan) region, Master Kim suddenly departed from Tokyo, accompanied only by his Japanese attendant, Wada Enjirō (和田延次郞). Also traveling with him were Hong Chong-u and a Chinese man named Wu (吳某). After staying several days in Osaka for some preparations, on the 23rd, they boarded the Saikyō Maru (西京丸) departing from Kobe for Shanghai. Having sought to establish the great work of Korean modernization relying on Japan's strength, only to become an exile—no, a banished soul—wandering for over 10 years, sometimes amidst the miasma of the isolated Ogasawara islands, sometimes amidst the wind and snow of Hokkaido, finally reaching the conclusion "not worth working with" (不足與爲, pujok yŏwi) and bidding farewell forever to the land of Fusang out of disappointment upon disappointment—no, as a kind of reaction against disappointment—what must have been Master Kim's feelings at that moment? Especially when viewed by us today, 26 years after that time...

Alas!! The Tragic Bloodshed on the Shanghai Bund

Though the people on the ship were enemies aiming guns, the weather at sea was unusually calm and gentle. The Saikyō Maru, having departed Kobe, arrived safely in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 27th. They settled into the Tōwa Yōkō (東和洋行),<49> a Japanese-run inn in the International Settlement (米租界, Mijogye - lit. American concession, but referring to the broader settlement). Master Kim and Wada took Room 1 on the second floor, and Hong took Room 2 next door. The next day, the 28th, from 1 PM, they planned to sightsee around the settlement, hiring three horse-drawn carriages. They had gone out separately in the morning. Wada returned first. Master Kim, feeling quite tired from the long journey by land and sea, took off his jacket and lay down on the bed, engrossed in reading the Zuo Zhuan (左傳) he had brought from Inukai Tsuyoshi (犬養木堂, Inukai Mokudō - Tsuyoshi's common name). At this moment, Hong, who had also been out, returned to the inn. He immediately changed from his usual Western clothes into Korean attire and paced around Master Kim's room, his behavior peculiar. However, Master Kim remained absorbed in his reading. Suddenly, he gave a name card (名啣) to Wada, instructing him to deliver it to Matsumoto, the captain of the Saikyō Maru. Wada followed the instruction and went out the door. As soon as Hong perceived Wada's footsteps fading away, he took out the six-shot revolver he had prepared and fired at Master Kim. The first shot fortunately struck Master Kim's left cheek. Master Kim leaped up, attempting to fight off the assailant, but he was empty-handed. The second bullet fired by Hong struck Master Kim's abdomen. Wada, heading downstairs with the name card, heard the successive gunshots and immediately started back up to the second floor. Just then, Hong rushed down, panting, his eyes bloodshot. Instantly realizing some terrible event had occurred, Wada frantically rushed upstairs. Indeed, Master Kim had collapsed in front of the door, fresh blood pooling around him. Wada lifted the collapsed Master Kim, cradling him and crying out repeatedly, "Master! Master!" (先生님 先生님), but there was no sign of life. Ah! Master Kim's heroic spirit had already departed this world. Ah! Master Kim's voice and cough were forever silenced in this world. From his youth, he dedicated his life to the great cause of his nation's revival, rushing east and west, enduring a life on the brink of death nine times over, only to become a lonely soul in a foreign land midway through his work. Master Kim must have foreseen the many hardships ahead; we know that great men throughout history often meet tragic ends, but could anyone imagine Master Kim's end would be this miserable? The pillar of the Restoration is broken; where shall we find the ridgepole for the new house? The lighthouse in the misty ford has gone dark; where shall the brothers of Kerim (鷄林, Kyerim - ancient name for Korea) go? On the upper floor of the Tōwa building, the sea breeze is still cold. Only Wada, a young student who doesn't share his blood or language, is there. He helplessly clutches the cooling body of Master Kim, weeping uncontrollably—Oh, the afternoon of March 28th, Kapo year (1894)!! At this time, Master Kim was merely 44 years old, twenty-six years ago from today.

When the news of Master Kim's assassination spread domestically and internationally, public indignation and sympathy surged towards him. Particularly, Japanese newspapers adopted an extremely fierce tone, reporting it in extras (號外, hogoe) across the land. Friends of Master Kim, both domestic and foreign from his lifetime, formed the "Kim Association of Friends" (金氏友人會) to manage the aftermath. First, they dispatched Saitō Shin'ichirō (齋藤新一郞) and Okamoto Ryūnosuke (岡本柳之助) to Shanghai to retrieve his remains. The assassin Hong was arrested by American police the day after the incident. The consuls of the foreign powers in Shanghai,<50> through their respective ministers in Beijing, demanded of the Zongli Yamen (總理衙門, China's Foreign Office) that "Hong be punished appropriately and that, after negotiating with the Korean government, Master Kim's body be repatriated to Korea under the condition that it not be desecrated." However, Li Hongzhang, who had instigated Master Kim's assassination, not only ignored this request but, on the contrary, secretly telegraphed the Daotai (道臺, circuit intendant) of Shanghai, ordering him to fully protect Hong Chong-u and send him back to Korea by warship along with Kim's body. The representatives sent from the Tokyo Friends Association to retrieve Master Kim's remains immediately negotiated with the captain of the Saikyō Maru to transport the remains to Japan by mail ship. After several days, on a certain morning, they moved the coffin to the pier. Suddenly, however, the settlement authorities prohibited the coffin's departure. When they went with the officials to the consulate to inquire about the reason and returned, the coffin was gone. Everyone, especially Wada, wept aloud, but the coffin had already fallen into the hands of Chinese authorities and was transported to Inch'ŏn by warship along with Hong. With matters having reached this point, Okamoto and the others could do nothing but return empty-handed to Tokyo. The Friends Association set up a spirit tablet and buried it at Aoyama [Cemetery in Tokyo], expressing their condolences.

When Master Kim's remains entered Kyŏngsŏng via Inch'ŏn, Li Hongzhang sent a long congratulatory telegram to the Korean court. The joy of the conservative faction reached its peak, and they lavishly rewarded Hong Chong-u's "merit." The foreign ministers stationed in Kyŏngsŏng repeatedly advised the Korean court against desecrating Master Kim's body, but their words fell on deaf ears. On April 14th, at Yanghwajin<51> on the Han River bank, about 40 li south of Kyŏngsŏng, the horrific punishment of dismemberment (八裂, p'allyŏl - lit. tearing into eight pieces) was posthumously carried out under the charge of heinous treason (大逆不道, taeyŏk pudo). His head was displayed on a pole (裊示, hyosi) in Kyŏngsŏng, his four limbs were circulated for display in the various provinces, and his torso was thrown into the Han River. Another account says it was simply abandoned there, with strict orders forbidding its retrieval, leaving it to be devoured by flies and dogs (蠅犬의 吸噬). Alas! The title of heinous treason was imposed upon a national martyr (國士, kuksa) of ages. First, his family was annihilated, then his assassination was deemed insufficient, so posthumous desecration was added. How heinous was their malice! At this time, a Japanese man named Kai Gunji (甲斐軍治) secretly stole strands of Master Kim's hair and pieces of his burial clothes and buried them at Shinjō-ji Temple (眞淨寺) in Hongō, Tokyo. (Several years ago, Master Kim's adopted son, Kim Yŏng-jin (金英鎭), currently serving as the magistrate of Poryŏng County, transferred Master Kim's hair from Tokyo and enshrined it in Asan.)

Master Kim's Character Viewed from Many Angles

Master Kim's actual deeds have been briefly recorded. Now, unable to suppress the lingering affection and remembrance of Master Kim, I wish to write specifically about his character and other aspects, based on what I have inquired. (Based on the words of a certain gentleman who accompanied Master Kim and shared hardships abroad for many years.)

Master Kim was, first and foremost, a man of love. When encountering people or things, he went directly to their essence, their true core, discovering their purity, without any preconceived notions based on superficial appearances. In Master Kim's heart, there were no great adults and no small children; there was no convention and no inertia; there were only people and truth. "Let anyone come, here is my hand" was his primary principle in dealing with others. Thus, from childhood, when playing with peers, he showed special warmth, and the children and youths of his hometown entirely looked up to him. When he entered the adoptive family in Kyŏngsŏng and lived at the site of the current High Normal School, Kim Hong-jip lived next door, and they visited each other morning and evening. Seeing that Hong-jip's family was poor and their meals coarse, the young Master Kim felt uneasy in his heart. Whenever his own meal tray arrived, he would invariably share it, passing it over the garden wall to Hong-jip. His benevolence grew richer with age. During his stay in Tokyo, he showed immense sympathy to the students who visited daily, giving 100 yen here, 10 yen there. When money ran short, he would secretly pawn his own travel belongings to satisfy his compassionate heart. People like Wada, who attended Master Kim until the end, met him by chance during his exile in Ogasawara (Wada was 9 years old then). Master Kim cherished him dearly, raising and teaching him with utmost affection. Moved by this kindness, Wada stayed by Master Kim's side until the very last. Master Kim once dismissed Confucianism as a religion of formalism, rejecting it from an early age. He was a devout believer in Buddhism, and much of his self-cultivation and broad knowledge came from it. Forgetting formalism and treating people just as people, Master Kim's friendships were exceptionally deep. It goes without saying that comrades like Ŏ Yun-jung, <52> Sŏ Kwang-bŏm, and a dozen others were deeply loyal to him. During his exile in Tokyo, he associated with numerous prominent Japanese figures. A single meeting would turn them into close friends sharing joys and sorrows. Among them, he reportedly had particularly intimate relationships with Fukuzawa Yukichi (福澤諭吉), Tōyama Mitsuru (頭山滿), and Inukai Tsuyoshi (犬養毅).

Furthermore, Master Kim was a man of warmth, magnanimity, and smooth eloquence (溫厚暢達, onhu ch'angdal). He never argued over minor matters initially. No pursuer could find an instance where he raised his voice or showed anger due to personal affairs. He enjoyed poetry and calligraphy, loved refined pursuits (風流, p'ungnyu), and excelled at Go (圍碁, wigo). While in Japan, Go players frequently visited him. Master Kim never aimed to win against any opponent, regardless of their skill, always ensuring the game ended in a draw or near-draw amidst conversation and laughter. When asked the reason, he explained that Go is a game; if played enjoyably to the very end, its purpose is fulfilled. What need is there to determine a winner and loser, thereby potentially upsetting the opponent's feelings even slightly? Master Kim took the greatest pleasure in preserving others' feelings. He often said, "Harming one's own or another's feelings over trivial matters unrelated to one's destiny is something my nature does not permit." Moreover, he had absolutely no concept of money. Since the Kapsin Incident, his entire family had been wiped out. During his exile and stay in Tokyo, there was no reason for him to have a penny in hand. Yet, he socialized effectively and gave generously. Except during his exile in Hokkaido, he never seemed troubled by lack of money. This was, of course, due to the willing donations of numerous friends who admired his character. If he owed money at a certain shop or restaurant, he would simply produce two letters. If the first recipient unfortunately had no money, the bearer was to visit the second recipient. These recipients were certainly not debtors to Master Kim; they were merely his friends. However, those two letters from Master Kim were reportedly more effective than a check, sufficiently revealing his way with money.

Master Kim was truly a genius without peer. Firstly, his intelligence was outstanding. He excelled at poetry and calligraphy. Within just three months of exile in Japan, he mastered the Japanese language. There's a story: one day, having business to attend to, he visited Mr. Ono (小野某), the president of a railway company, together with Inukai. After exchanging pleasantries, Master Kim, in his usual fluent manner, engaged in a lengthy discussion, with Inukai occasionally interjecting. When Master Kim finished speaking, the host, Ono, turned to Inukai, praised his skillful Japanese, and asked, "When did you study Japanese so diligently?" causing great laughter among those present. Also, no matter how large the gathering at a banquet, once he met someone, he would remember their face and name forever after. Furthermore, Master Kim never needed to pause and reconsider when writing a letter, no matter who the recipient was. However, at the age of 42 (Imjin year, 1892), when writing to Li Hongzhang <53> regarding the aforementioned issue of traveling north [to China], because Li was Li and the matter was serious, he reread the letter after finishing it. Unfortunately, he found he had omitted a single character. Master Kim sighed to a friend nearby, lamenting, "I too am growing old."

Moreover, Master Kim was an incomparable reformer and creator. Possessing a nature that did not stop at seeing the superficial falsehoods but inevitably touched the sacred essence of things, it was natural for him to be so. Thus, meticulously refining an existing work to perfection was not Master Kim's forte. Pak Yŏng-hyo, for instance, conspired with Master Kim in all matters at the time, yet his strength was the exact opposite of Master Kim's—it lay not in creation but in refining and completing tasks. In essence, these two complementary talents (兩璧, yangbyŏk) worked together, planning Korea's modernization.

Master Kim always maintained himself with peace and joy. Even those who lived with him for years never saw him idle or bedridden due to boredom. He constantly practiced calligraphy and painting, recited ancient poems and songs, chatted happily with neighborhood children and youths, or strolled outside the school grounds. He never spent a moment idly. He rarely visited others but rather had people visit him. Wherever Master Kim went, a crowd always gathered. With his ambitions set on great things, Master Kim did not indulge in self-celebration. Even his closest friends did not know his birthday. In the spring of the Kapo year, facing a perilous destiny and planning to head to China, Master Kim one day invited Yu Hyŏk-ro, who was staying with him, and two or three others for an evening of enjoyment. They complied. Reflecting after the tragedy in Shanghai, they realized that day was Master Kim's birthday—this according to the tearful account of a surviving friend who was present that night. Perhaps this echoes the ancient story of Jesus Christ taking his disciples up the Mount of Olives on the night he was to face the cross?

The magnanimous and eloquent Master Kim also indulged quite a bit in playful humor (戱謔, hŭihaek). When he first arrived in Tokyo as an exile, whenever he rode a rickshaw, regardless of the distance, he would give whatever amount came to hand—1 yen, 10 yen, or 100 yen—earning him the reputation of possibly being mad. Once, he went with Itō Hirobumi (伊藤博文) to the Shuzenji hot springs and stayed at the Ōkawa Ryokan (大川旅舘). When leaving the inn the next morning, Itō offered 500 yen as a tip (茶代, chadae). Master Kim instantly offered 1,000 yen, a story that is still told as an anecdote in that area.

Master Kim, sensitive to the trends of the times, often made remarks, even in casual conversation, that turned out like prophecies. Mount Kŭmgang (金剛山) in Kangwŏn Province is now a world-famous site, attracting streams of domestic and foreign tourists, but 40 or 50 years ago, it was known only by name. Master Kim used to say jokingly <54> that the only thing in Korea that could snatch foreigners' money was Mount Kŭmgang. He predicted, "Within 20 years, Kŭmgang will become Korea's 'Gold River' (金江, Kŭmgang - a pun)." He also said, "Only when the Han River flows through the entire city of Kyŏngsŏng will the curtain finally rise on a new life." Viewed today, these predictions seem quite accurate. He also reportedly said, "Unless Korea's capital is moved north of P'yŏngan Province, it will be difficult to achieve Korea's great success, and we will not be able to cultivate a great national character." This too does not seem like a casual remark. Besides these, there must be countless other anecdotes and sayings left by Master Kim, but some are difficult to verify, and even those currently circulated may lack reliable sources, so I will summarize the anecdotes here.

A Word Like a Conclusion

Master Kim, born fortunately or unfortunately onto the trouble-ridden Korean peninsula in the late 19th century, just as Western trends were surging in and the long slumbering eyes of the East were beginning to open, harbored god-like insight and ocean-vast ideals from early on. With unwavering resolve, he pondered how to lead the twenty million people out of the pitch-black cave and how to save the three-thousand-ri (千里, ch'ŏlli - traditional measure of Korea's length) land of Korea from global decline. He challenged the stubborn and ignorant conservative faction internally and joined hands with Japan, which had a day's advantage, externally. As he steadily laid down his grand plans in a corner of Hansŏng, his schemes failed due to lack of strength, falling short of achieving even a fraction of his goals. He became a drifting soul (萍蓬, p'yŏngbong) amidst the wind and frost of foreign lands. For ten years, his heart bled and burned with anxiety day and night. Pinning his last shred of hope on China, he moved his haggard body to the Shanghai Bund, only to be struck down by a vicious assassin's blow, becoming a lonely soul far from home. "To devote oneself completely until death puts an end to service" (鞠躬盡瘁死而後已, kukkungjinch'oesaihunaŭi) - perhaps this phrase comes close to describing Master Kim's situation? Ah, reaching this thought, tears flow spontaneously, beyond any description. Let me add a few more lines about Master Kim's especially cherished character and conclude this record, heavy with emotion.

Master Kim was a world-class great man (this is the writer's earnest plea; please do not think these are mere words of praise) of utmost benevolence and sincerity, multi-talented and wise, possessing a resolute spirit and great courage, magnanimous, harmonious, and eloquent. His heart always harbored bright winds and clear moonlight (光風霽月, kwangp'ungjewŏl - symbolizing noble character); his breast held a disposition of freedom and greatness. His daily speech carried a unique tone—lofty and pure, yet clear and agile—truly imbued with the color of poetic style, radiating brilliance everywhere. Anyone encountering him would instantly perceive him as a great man, rich in friendship and love. Master Kim's affection for children and youths seems to have been a simple microcosm of all the love hidden in his heart. Ah, on one hand, the terrifying challenge of death, and on the other, such an unceasing flow of profound love! Shall we call these the two poles of a great man? <55> All the grandeur of the world seems concentrated here. Not only this, but his clarity and lack of haste when facing matters, and his pure sincerity without deceit when dealing with people, were truly like a lightly rigged boat skillfully navigating through a sea of islands, or like a gushing clear spring flowing from a rock cave. To put it in one word: not only in terms of achievements but also in terms of character, we can say without reservation that Master Kim is a great product of modern Korea—no, a world-class great man. Whether in wisdom, benevolence, talent, sincerity, or courage, he embodied the great of the great, the pure of the pure. We can say that Master Kim alone is one of the figures we should most respect and most love. Indeed. His greatness was not the greatness of an obelisk built layer upon heavy layer; like the highest peak of Paektu Mountain, it was naturally great without striving for greatness. His purity was not the contrived purity of a garden park achieved by adding one plant to another; it was the purity like that of the great forests along the Yalu River, spontaneously formed by the rain and dew of the earth. There is truly a world of difference between him and the vulgar great men who stand in the world wearing sheep's clothing, desiring greatness and feigning purity!! His situation!!

Ah, Master Kim's great achievements, his character—for generations to come, for ten thousand ages, they are sufficient to be the inspiration and lifeblood for us brothers—no, for the countless masses under heaven.

Out of extreme admiration for Master Kim, I hastily drafted this piece. However, references were incomplete, and the printing deadline was quite pressing, so there will likely be many errors (杜撰, tuch'an). I intend to revise and supplement as I discover more later. I respectfully express my gratitude to Master Kim, whose spirit watches over us loftily, and to all beloved readers. (Reporter/Writer)<56>

**Summary**

This 1920 article from the magazine *Kaebyŏk* is a passionate rehabilitation of Kim Ok-kyun, leader of the failed 1884 Kapsin Coup. The anonymous author portrays Kim not as a traitor (as viewed by the late Chosŏn court and conservatives) but as a tragically misunderstood, world-class "great man" and visionary reformer. It details his early life, rapid rise, embrace of enlightenment ideas, the Kapsin Coup attempt, his subsequent exile in Japan marked by hardship and betrayal, and his eventual assassination in Shanghai orchestrated by conservative Korean forces with Chinese complicity, followed by the gruesome posthumous desecration of his body. The article emphasizes Kim's intelligence, charisma, modernizing vision, deep patriotism, personal integrity, and capacity for love and friendship, contrasting him sharply with the corrupt and backward-looking conservative establishment and the manipulative interference of China and, at times, Japan.

For historians of the colonial period, this article is significant as an early example of Korean nationalist historiography attempting to reclaim and redefine controversial figures from the late Chosŏn period. Published just a year after the March 1st Movement, its fervent call for recognizing national heroes and its portrayal of Kim as a martyr for modernization reflects the intense desire among Korean intellectuals under Japanese rule to construct a narrative of indigenous modernity and resistance against perceived backwardness and foreign domination (both Chinese and implicitly, the circumstances leading to Japanese colonization). The emotional tone, the emphasis on Kim's "world-class" status, and the detailed recounting of his suffering and betrayal serve to build sympathy and inspire nationalist sentiment among readers. The explicit comparison, however brief, of Kim's final days to Jesus Christ's suffering underscores the hagiographic intent.

忠達公 金玉均 先生
個人主義와 떼모크라시가 盛傳하는 近日에 在하야 英雄 云云의 소리는 끈칠만도 하다. 그러니 그런 것 갓지도 안이하며 英雄(以下 偉人이라 改稱함)을 要求하는 聲은 四面에서 더욱 高하는 듯 하도다. 偉人이란 암만 하야도 아조 除外할 수는 업는 樣이다. 盖偉人이란 人生의 首領으로 一般民衆의 畢竟에는 必히 成할, 或은 到達할 무엇을 提示하는 우리오 模型儀表ㅡ 更言하면 一種의 創造家를 云함이니 或國家或民族의 質量은 그의 有無로 因하야 重輕되며 尙一般人衆은 그에 近하며 仰함으로 由하야 靈感을 得하며 光明을 認하나니 或民族으로서 自家歷史 中에 그리할만한 偉人이 업다 하며 又有하다 할지라도 그 民族 스스로가 埋葬하고 發見치 안이하면 그 얼마나 슯흐고 嘶膓할 일이리오. 今日의 우리는 偉人의 出現을 甚히 要求하도다. 그 影子라도 對하얏스면 하도다. 그러나 一般은 아즉 그를 發見치 못하얏도다. 世間의 普通 偉人이 無함은 안이나 그네로써 우리의 慕仰의 標的을 삼기에는 넘우 섭섭하도다. 우리 同胞 中에 特히 今日 우리의 懿範이 되기에 足한 或偉人을 發見한다 하면 그 多幸히 果如何할가 이제 우리 一部가 辱하고 씻고 처뭇고 스스로 이즌 쳬 하던 朝鮮近代의 最大産物ㅡ 안이 世界的 偉人ㅡ 金玉均 先生을 敢히 紹介하노니 完全不完全은 記者가 그 責을 自負하려니와 兄弟들이어 爲先 各自의 거룩한 沉黙과 뜨거운 느낌으로써 先生의 聖跡과 偉格을 沈思熱想함이 有할지어다.

先生의 出生과 그 官歷
距金 69年前 辛亥 正月 23日 忠淸南道 天安 安東金門의 某家에 呱呱의 聲을 出한 一馨香兒가 有하얏스니 그 父-그의 眉目이 玉가티 淸秀함을 愛하야 仍히 玉均이라＜41＞ 賜名하얏더라. 可言할 處의 傳하는 바에 依하면 그는 2歲에 能히 語를 解하며 3歲에 能히 父母의 對話者가 되어 一家의 寵愛는 專혀 그의 身에 集注하엿스며 6,7歲가 되어 隣家兒와 交遊를 試함에 及하야는 그 어린兒의 일이나 同侔에 對한 사랑의 情이 別로 濃하며 웃으운 말 한 마대라도 퍽 滋味잇게 情답게 하야 그 附近의 幼少年은 그를 떠이다 십히 하야 그의 門前에는 恒常 市를 成하얏다 한다. 待人接物에 對한 天才는 幼時부터 發揮되엇더라.
何年의 事인지 記할 수는 업스나(10歲 內外時인 듯) 先生은 天安의 鄕第를 出하야 京城 花開洞 前郡守 金炳基氏家의 養子가 되며 仍히 京城의 人이 되엇스니 現洞開京城高等普通學校基地는 當年 先生의 住宅 所在處이라 한다. 京城에 移住한 先生은 養親의 指導下에 古漢學을 修하얏는데 그의 英勃한 才氣는 觸處에 發揮되어 修學末幾에 곳 詩와 文을 能히 하며 또 書에 長하야 見者聞者ㅡ 皆呆然할 而已이엇스며 年纔弱冠에 直히 試果에 應하야 龍門의 第一天을 射하얏스며 連하야 玉堂의 榮冠을 慱하매 그의 文名은 當世를 驚動하야 先生은 旣히 花開洞中의 凡夫가 안이엇다. 桃李開處에 蹊逕自成이오 現龍在田에 雲雨必施라 先生의 거룩이엇지 그에 뿐 止하리요. 遂히 當世의 偉傑 大院翁의 知한 바 되어 一躍 吏曹叅議의 要職에 就하니 當年이 實로 19歲ㅡ비록 1人의 愛憎으로 因하야 或一人의 龍猪를 決하는 當時의 事이라 할지라도 果然 可驚할 事가 안인가. 先生은 그 後 累進하야 吏曹叅判을 經하야 26歲의 時는 戶曹判書의 印綬를 佩하얏더라.

朝鮮政界의 混沌과 先生의 奮起
世間社會에는 언제던지 무슨 潮流가 流하는 것이니 그 潮流의 推移를 明察하며 그에 順應하야 可히 乘할 時에 乘하는 者는 榮하며 興할 것이오. 그러치 못하는 者는 枯하며 亡할 것이라. 窃唯컨대 19世紀 下半期에 在한 歐米 勢力의 向東決潰는 東洋人에게 對한 一大潮流ㅡ 안이 一大荒流이엇나니 試思하라. 此荒流로 因하야 國이 漂하고 民族이 替한 者ㅡ 實로 幾何인가. 幸히 日本이 此流에 乘하야 維新의 鴻業을 完成하얏스며 支那가 躕躇末決하야 國恥民辱을 蒙하고 版圖가 縮하얏스며 不幸 우리 朝鮮은 全혀 그 潮流에 乘치 못하야 畢竟 國을 擧하야 日本과 倂合함에 至하얏도다. 讀者諸兄이어 特히 記者의 懇請이니 設或 支離한 感이 有할지라도 去甲子 以來 當時 當局者의 그 潮流에 對한 處策을 略述하야 金玉均 先生의 偉行에 及함이 有케 하라.＜42＞
처음 哲宗이 崩하고 無嗣하매 距今 57年前 癸亥에 興宣君의 子 *를 擁立하야 王位에 就케 하니 時年이 12임으로 興宣君이 大院君이 되어 庶政을 攝하게 되엇다. 大院君은 意氣ㅡ 壯하고 決行에 長하야 實로 英雄의 素質을 有하얏스나 可惜 識見이란 것이 그에 添치 못하야 그의 執權은 正히 頑兒가 利刀를 執함과 如하얏다. 그의 頑腦는 第一로 鎖國主義를 固執하야 先着手로 天主敎徒를 虐殺하고 丙寅에는 佛國 宣敎師를 殺하야 佛艦 7隻이 江華島를 進擊하매 此를 擊退하얏스며 庚午에 米國商船이 大同江을 溯하매 船員을 全혀 擊殺하얏슴으로 그 後 米軍艦 5隻이 漢江으로 進軍하매 亦 擊退하얏다. 當時 所謂 佛米軍이라 함은 單히 問責 或은 通商을 目的하야 來함이오 決코 戰鬪를 爲하야 來함이 안인 同時에 그 軍人數와 武器의 準備가 如何히 些微하얏슬 것은 誰이나 推知할 것이니 是를 稱하야 丙寅洋亂 云云하야 全國이 騷動함과 如함은 實로 可笑할 事이라. 此를 擊退한 大院君은 米佛全國兵이나 擊退한 듯이 意氣自揚하야 外人을 輕侮하기 日甚하얏다. 是에 先하야 日本으로서 戊辰 9月(明治元年)에 對馬島守吏 宗重正을 遣來하야 王政의 復舊를 告하고 國交의 修好를 請하얏는데 그 國書 中에 大日本皇帝라 書한 것이 有함을 見하고 『오즉 中國이 帝號를 用할 뿐이어늘 日本이 焉敢用此乎아』하야 接受를 拒하고 繼하야 東萊 釜山 兩地에 在한 日韓官吏接見을 撤廢하매 日庭에서는 遂히 征韓論까지 起하얏스며 그 후 乙亥에 日艦 雲揚號가 우리의 沿岸及支那牛莊 等 處를 測量하고저 仁川 月尾島를 過할새 江華灣에 下泊하고 小艇으로 漢江을 溯하는 中 永宗城의 砲臺는 突然 此에 砲擊을 加하매 雲揚號가 應戰하야 永宗城을 奪하고 東京에 報하니 於是乎(翌年 2月) 日本의 黑田淸隆이 全權大使로 來京하야 先年의 國書拒絶과 軍艦砲擊의 無禮를 責하며 修好條約의 締結을 要求하매 大院君의 反對가 如前하야 廷議紛紜하얏스나 此時의 右大臣 朴圭壽 以下 7,8人이 群議를 排하고 開國의 利益을 力說하야 韓日修好條約을 締結하니 所謂 江華條約이 是이라. 此條約으로 因하야 朝鮮은 獨立自主邦으로 日本과 平等의 權이 有함을 認하야 從來 中國과의 宗屬關係를 斷하고 元山 仁川 2港을 通商埠로 開하기로 하며 (元山은 庚辰年에 仁川은 庚寅年에 開하다) 半島沿海는 日本人의 自由測量에 一任하다.
此江華條約의 成立은 實로 當時 朝鮮政海에 一爆彈을 投한 셈이엇도다. 卽 開國의 利益을 主唱한 朴圭壽 側의 勝利는＜43＞ 斥洋斥倭로 鎖國主義를 固執하던 大院君 便의 勢力消失을 意味함인 바 朝鮮과 中國이 有한 外에 更히 他國이 有함을 不知하며 鎖國弄權의 政策 外에 更히 他事가 有함을 不知하던 當時 政局에 向하야 朝鮮 中國이 有한 外에 更히 日本 其他 外國이 有하며 鎖國主義 以外에 門戶開放 新政樹立의 急務가 有함을 奄覺하얏스며 朝鮮의 自主國임을 認하고 日本과 平等의 權이 有함을 認한다는 一條는 昨日까지 正朔을 奉하던 中國과의 問題가 勃發하야 잘하나 못하나 제멋대로 놀던 漢城의 政局은 漸次 日本 中國 兩勢力의 角逐地가 되엇도다.
그런데 右江華條約 締結되던 時 先生의 年은 旣히 26으로 戶曹判書의 顯職에 在하얏다. 如許한 時局을 當하야 苟히 眼이 有하고 耳가 有한 者이면 誰이나 自安치 못하겟거던 而況無形에 見하고 無聲에 聽하는 如神機智를 有한 先生ㅡ 多年 宦海의 亂流에 立하야 貪官汚吏의 醜行과 人心世道의 傷敗에 慨然하야 그 心機가 將次 一轉을 告코저 하던 그 際의 先生이리요. 先生은 於是乎 翻然히 起하며 躍如히 出하야 新朝鮮의 建設의 第一人으로 自任하고 政治的으로나 社會的으로나 爲先 開化하여야 할 것을 絶叫하며 그리함에는 5,000年의 鴻夢에 宿醉가 依然한 支那와 幄手함보다 唯新의 奔走 中에 在한 日本과 連袂하야 知識을 世界에 求함이 最得策이며 捷經이라 하야 右記江華事變이 起할 時에는 朴圭壽氏와 共히 開國의 利益을 主唱하얏스며 江華條約의 締結과 共히 大院君一派 卽 守舊側의 勢力이 漸微하매 先生은 此機可乘이라 하야 層一層 開化主義의 宣傳과 同志의 結合에 奮力하야 旣히 開化黨의 稱號를 得하게 되엇다.
辛巳春 距今 39年前 先生 年 31)이라. 先生은 夙志의 實現이 1日이라도 加急함을 思하고 着手의 第一步로 當時 堂局과 謀하야 遊覽朝士의 名義下에 徐光範 兪吉濬 等 朝野名士 十數人(開化主義者)과 共히 日本에 往하야 그 維新政策을 親히 視察하고 歸하야 別로히 進步主義를 高唱하며 是時 大院君의 今上廢立의 陰謀가 有하얏다는 事를 機로 하야 大히 守舊派를 排斥하고 親政을 力圖할새 訓練院의 現 東大門小學校迹에 士官學校를 設하고 日本人 堀本 陸軍中尉를 新聘하야 新軍을 訓練하며 其他 各面으로 庶政의 維新을 策하얏다. 是時에 大院君은 政界로 退隱을 當하야 快快不樂中에 國論이 日本으로 傾하는 嫌이 有하며 且同志가 退朝하고 閔族의 專政함을 忿하야 窃히 與黨을 糾合하야 勢力의 挽回를 策하던 중 翌年 壬午軍＜44＞(本誌 「三十日間의 五千年」이란 題를 參照)이 起하매 大院君은 亂兵을 慫慂하야 堀本 中尉를 殺하고 公使館을 襲擊하며 一方 王宮을 犯하야 宰相 李最應을 殺하고 스스로 政權을 收하고 仍히 勢力을 回復하얏스니 그 後 此事變으로 中日 兩國 共히 出兵하야 善後策을 議할새 中日 兩國 國除의 交誼를 重히 하는 意로 中國 李鴻章은 京城駐在 馬公使를 命하야 大院君을 捕하야 天津에 拘束케 하고 局面一變의 新空氣 中에 韓日의 修好로 濟物浦條約을 締結하고 局을 終하얏는데 此條約의 實行으로 同年 10月에 政府에서는 謝罪大使로 朴泳孝
金晩植을 日本에 派遣할새 先生이 그 使節의 一行에 加入하야 再次 日本에 赴하얏다. 此行의 任務를 終하고 朴泳孝, 金晩植 等은 直히 歸國함에 不拘라고 先生은 日本에 殘留하야 日本 維新의 施政을 詳究하며 一面으로 本國에 잇는 同志와 策應하야 國政의 革新을 圖하기로 하고 日人 牛場卓造와 井上角五郞을 薦하야 政府의 顧問을 作하며 又 同志를 糾合하야 獨立黨을 組織케 하며 更히 韓日 兩國 親善의 條件으로 旣成條約의 失行과 留學生 派遣의 案을 本國政府에 提示하야 遂히 朝野의 贊成을 得하야 公使館 護衛로 日兵의 駐京이 始하고 柳赫魯, 徐載弼, 兪星濬, 李圭完, 申應熙, 鄭蘭敎, 趙秉敎 等 數十人의 留學生이 東京에 出現되니 是卽 朝鮮留學의 嚆矢이엇섯다. 先生은 그 후 日本에 加留할 必要가 無함으로 將來 事業의 預備로 多少 金錢을 求處而歸하얏더라.

運命!! 運命!! 先生의 二日內閣
先生이 開化主義者를 糾合하야 獨立黨을 組織하는 同時에 閔族을 中心으로 한 守舊側의 一派는 守舊黨을 組織하야 當時 2黨의 分立을 見하야 兩黨의 反目 如何는 不問可推할 것이다. 且 壬午軍變 後로 中國政府는 先生을 中心으로 한 獨立黨의 一派가 日本에 傾함과 共히 日本의 對朝鮮勢力의 日增함을 見하고 亦內政에 干涉하기로 策을 定하고 李鴻章은 商務總辦 陳樹棠 及 獨逸人 穆麟德을 遣하야 顧問을 定케 하고 袁世凱로 駐韓全權委員을 拜하야 2,000의 兵과 共히 京城에 駐屯케 한 바 袁은 當時 겨우 24歲의 靑年이나 그 智謀手腕이 遙히 人을 壓하야 能히 各國公使를 籠絡하고 巧히 守舊派를 操縱하야 勢力을 大히 朝廷에 扶植하고 百方으로 獨立黨의 經營을 沮戱하매 그러틋 機智에 明한 先生으로도 直히 手를 下할 餘地가 無하얏다. 그런데 此時(甲申) 中國이 安南事件으로 法國과 起*하야 佛艦隊가 東航하게 되매 朝鮮問題에 對한 注意가 弛함과＜45＞共히 日本 堂局의 朝鮮에 對한 方針도 忽變하야 開化黨을 援助할 意가 有하얏스며 且駐京公使 竹添進一郞은 別로 獨立黨에 加擔할 意를 示하매 先生도 此機를 不可失이라 하야 仍히 實行準備에 着手하니 그 準備는 卽 이러하얏다. 그때 마츰 京城郵政局이 竣工되어 12月 4日 午後 9時에 盛大한 落成宴을 擧行하게 되엇다. 當夜에는 各黨大官은 勿論이오 各國 公使까지도 來會할 터인 바 此機에 當夜叅席 又는 在家한 守舊側 一派의 大官을 一擧 撲滅하되 그 計畫은 布囊數 10個를 作하야 此에 木屑을 盛하야 別宮正殿 內에 積置하고 石油를 注하야 點火케 하며 또 別로히 爆發藥을 그 近傍에 排置하야 火勢蔓延과 共히 此가 爆發하면 그 音響을 軍號로 壯士를 命하야ㅡ 이리이리하기로 하얏다.
12月 4日! 先生의 一生 運命을 決할 안이 新朝鮮의 建立與否를 決할 12月 4日은 來하얏다. 先生의 約束한 秘密 그대로 來하얏다. 新築된 郵政局의 大廣間에는 各國 使臣이며 閔泳翊을 始하야 守舊黨員 一派도 圓滿히 出席하얏다. 宴至將半하야 主客의 談笑가 正히 濃할만한 時 先生은 暗號를 用하야 別宮에 裝置한 爆發藥에 數次 點火하얏스나 何故인지 아모 消息이 업는지라 不得已 隣家에 放火케 하니 燄燄한 火光이 郵政局의 琉璃廠을 亂射하매 戶外에서는 宮城에 出火하얏다. 大聲疾呼하는지라 列席하얏던 一同은 精神업시 戶外로 驅出할새 그 中 閔泳翊은 啞然失色하고 先頭로 奔出하매 豫待하던 刺客은 快히 그를 邀擊하얏스나 巧하게도 適中치 못하매 閔은 局內로 遁入하고 刺客은 更히 姿를 隱하얏다. 此時 局內에서는 或 呼泣 或 發狂 或 逃走하야 正히 修羅場을 現出하얏다. 先是하야 豫約이 有한 竹添公使는 兵을 率하고 宮城을 護衛한 바 先生은 朴泳孝와 共히 王宮에 奔叅하야 暴兵의 作亂이라 秦達하고 緊急 王命으로 守舊黨의 一派 後營大將 尹泰駿 吏曹判書 趙寧夏 前營大將 韓圭稷 左衛大將 李祖淵 及 閔泳穆
閔台鎬 등을 宮中으로 召하야 途中에서 擊殺하니 於是乎 守舊黨은 殆히 除去되어 開化黨의 天下가 되엇다. 翌日 新內閣을 組織할새 先生과 朴氏 洪英植을 始하야 開化黨의 袖領은 大槪 入閣하야 萬般의 政務를 一新할새 先히 大詔를 發하야 庶政의 一新을 布告한 後 썩어진 官吏를 淘汰하며 門閥을 廢하며 宦官의 權을 奪하며 朝貢의 禮를 止하며 租稅를 整하며 其他 文明의 新制를 布施하기로 하야 先生 多年의 風志는 此로써 實現의 第一矢를 放하얏다. 如斯한 步調로 長驅而進하면 不出期年에 半島의 山河도＜46＞ 面目이 一新하며 百度 更張하야 朝鮮의 維新을 期成하얏슬 것이라. 嗚呼라. 新內閣의 樹立이 昨日인데 宮城束方의 銃聲 殷殷이 是何不幸가 2日 夜에 倖免한 閔泳翊 一族은 直히 袁世凱의 救護를 請한 바 袁은 2,000의 大兵을 率하고 宮城을 來圍하얏다. 竹添公使의 軍이 此와 應戰하얏스나 衆寡不敵으로 敗北의 兆가 先現하매 先生은 王을 扶腋하고 宮北門을 向하고 林間으로 入하야 布毛로 御座를 設하고 世界의 大勢와 朝鮮의 將來를 痛哭伏秦하여 爲先 對時局策으로 仁川까지 避御하야 後計를 施할 事를 力請하얏스나 時에 閔后가 閔族과 共히 袁의 軍中에 在하고 且日本의 勢力이 不可恃함을 知한 王은 先生의 秦請을 不納하고 袁世凱 營中으로 私避하매 竹添公使는 兵員寡少 中에 更히 王宮護衛의 實을 失하야 退京의 不得已에 至하얏다. 玆에 先生은 日兵의 擁護 下에 僅히 公使館까지 至하야 親히 그 髮을 快斷하야 暖爐 中에 入하고 日服을 着한 後 竹添公使와 共히 仁川으로 亡命하야 卽時 下關向 汽船에 登하야 悲憤慷慨 中에 仁川을 出錨하니 當時의 同行은 先生과 一大事를 同謀한 朴泳孝, 徐光範, 徐在弼 等이엇스며 先生을 逐出한 漢城의 政略은 旣히 守舊黨의 天下가 되어 沈潤澤이 宰相이 되어 洪英植 其他 開化黨員의 在京者는 그 家族까지 全部 撲滅하얏더라.

日本으로 가는 亡命ㅡ 辛酸한 그 生活
先生은 그 險亂 그 敗北의 中에도 捲土重來의 志를 懷하고 下關으로 東京에 着하얏다. 當時 日本政府에서는 竹添公使의 輕擧를 責하며 態度가 忽變하야 先生에 對한 身上의 待遇도 甚히 冷酷하며 井上外務大臣과 如한 人은 屢次 往訪하나 一席의 面會까지 不應한 바 先生은 日本의 背信을 憤慨한 事도 1,2가 안이엇슬 것이다. 그리고 朴泳孝, 徐光範, 徐載弼 3人은 渡日 後 直히 米國에 更赴하고 先生이 獨留하던 中 朴은 未幾에 更히 東京으로 歸하야 先生과 同居함에 此를 知한 守舊黨으로 成한 朝廷에서는 金朴의 再謀事를 慮하야 乙酉에 徐相雨 穆麟德이 國書를 奉하고 謝罪大使로 日本에 往하는 同時에 先生과 其他 一派의 人을 朝鮮에 歸還케 할 事를 要求하얏스나 日本政府에서는 韓日間에 罪人交換條約이 無하고 又 國事犯은 國際法에 交還치 안는 例가 有하다. 抗拒하매 翌年 丙戌에 守舊黨에서는 更히 刺客 池運永을 窃히 日本에 送遣하야 先生을 暗殺하기로 하매 幸히 本國人 中 此를 先生에게 密報한 者가 有함으로 先生의 知友는 直히 此를 日本政府에 告한 바＜47＞ 政府에서는 駐京日公使에게 命하야 『日本은 金을 國境外로 退出케 할 터이니 刺客을 撤回하라.』하매 守舊側도 亦 此에 應하야 池運永을 召還하얏다. 其時 朴은 更히 日人 大井憲太郞 小林樟雄 等과 共謀하야 本國政府를 顚覆코저 하다가 謀洩하매 守舊側은 益益 不安을 感하야 更히 先生一派의 退出을 迫하매 日本政府는 畢竟 先生을 小笠原島에 放하니 此島는 絶海의 一孤島로 人煙은 稀少하며 瘴癘는 別酷하야 先生이 到此不出幾月에 健康을 大損하야 그 憔悴의 形容으로 島邊에 呻吟하는 狀ㅡ見者聞者 皆熱淚를 揮치 안으리 업섯다. 其後 日廷當局의 諒解를 得하야 東京으로 暫歸하얏스나 무슨 事情이 有하얏는지 先生은 更히 北海道에 退去하라는 命令을 受하얏다. 艱辛히 病軀를 携하야 同島에 着하얏스나 言語習俗이 異하고 氣候까지 懸殊한 萬里異域이엇지 先生의 堪居할 處이엇스리요. 더욱 日本政府로서 好誼 支拂하던 月 100圓金의 生活費도 漸減되어 75圓이 되며 다시 減하야 50圓 更히 17圓으로 되엇다가 乃終에는 그나마 支給을 中止하얏다. 在東京의 友人들이 甚히 此를 悲하야 先生에 對한 放免을 百方으로 運動하얏스나 何等 效果를 不遂하고 다만 若干의 金을 親睦會의 月損金가티 收送하야 僅히 先生의 朝夕을 供하엿슬 뿐이엇다. 그 悲慘한 生活 中에 約 6年의 長歲月을 속태우고 辛卯年 頃 僅히 東京으로 돌아온 先生은 오즉 顔色이 憔悴하고 短髮뿐 蕭蕭하야 當年의 優雅하던 그 風彩를 求景할 수가 업고 轗軻不遇의 態를 誰이라도 認하게 되엇다. 그러나 新朝鮮의 建設을 爲하야 2千萬 民族의 幸福을 作키 爲하야 唯猛是進하는 一片丹心은 小毫不弛하야 朴氏와 共히 再起의 計를 策하얏다. 此機를 探窺한 守舊黨側으로서는 壬辰에 更히 刺客 李逸稙을 遣하야 先生과 朴 2人을 暗殺코저 할새 李는 商業으로 爲名하고 日本에 渡하야 先生을 圖할 機를 待하던 中 마츰 佛國으로 歸하는 洪鍾宇를 遇하야 그 辯說知慧의 足히 利用할만함을 見하고 利害로써 威하고 恩賞으로써 誘함에 洪은 遂히 傾心하야 李와 더블어 二心치 안이할 事를 盟하고 巧히 李의 紹介로 先生과 밋 朴氏에게 面會를 得하얏다. 洪은 李의 奸誘로 因하야 先生을 圖하는 惡漢이 되엇스나 자못 大人의 氣宇가 잇고 且歐米를 漫遊하야 그 言行이 足取할만 하며 時事를 痛論할 時는 經綸이 溢出하야 事業이 有함을 是知하는 先生은 그를 漸次 近接하게 하얏다. 그러나 그 後 未幾에 그의 行動이 頗異함을 看破하고 多少 懷疑가 不無하던 中 洪의 陰謀를 告하는 者 有하야 十分 警戒를 備하면서도 大膽한＜48＞ 先生은 그런 내색이 업시 如前히 그와 從遊하얏다. 그러나 洪은 日本은 到底 自己의 陰謀를 實現할 地가 안임을 看破하고 本國의 守舊黨側과 交涉하야 先生을 如何히 하던지 他國으로 誘出하야 擧事하기로 하고 1日은 先生을 訪하야 『故國의 革命은 先生의 獨力으로 能히 目的을 達할 바가 안이라 余가 中國에 留連한지 14年에 李鴻章의 男 李經芳과 더불어 親交가 잇스니 그의 紹介를 得하야 李鴻章과 더불어 大事를 圖하면 必히 그 目的을 成하리라.』 力說한 바 先生은 正히 半信半疑하던 中 그 後 未數日에 燕京으로서 一書가 飛入하니 李經芳의 手札인 中 洪의 獻策과 異句同曲이라. 是는 當時 駐京 卽 袁世凱 李鴻章 間의 先生을 誘하는 奸策에서 出한 것이라 先生은 多少 此를 量치 안음도 안이나 歲月은 悾憁하고 機會는 漸遠하는데 希望도 보이지 안는 滄海一隅에 徒히 踽凉함과 如함은 先生으로 忍爲할 바가 못 되며 且一面 李鴻章의 人格을 信하고 斷然히 中國을 向하기로 決心하얏스니 即 李의 父子를 利用하야 扶桑에서 失한 志를 西楡에서 得코저 함이다. 此機를 知한 諸親友는 中國行의 危險ㅡ卽 李의 奸計에 陷할 것을 切言하야 그 行을 中止코저 하얏스나 先生은 『李鴻章이 果偉人이면 齷齪히 余를 殺하야 事功을 收코저 함과 如한 鄙行은 不爲할지며 設或 此行이 그의 奸計이라 할지라도 東洋의 今日에 在하야 日本에서 旣히 不如意하고 또 支那를 疑하면 余의 往할 處는 更히 何地이냐? 余는 오즉 虎穴에 入할 뿐이라... ..』는 數言 下에 拒絶하고 甲午春 3月 10日 先生은 京坂 地方 旅行 爲名 下에 從者 日本人 和田延次郞을 伴하야 突然히 東京을 出發하니 同行에 洪鍾宇 中國人 吳某가 有하얏슬 뿐 大阪에서 무슨 準備로 幾日을 加留하고 同 23日 神戶發 西京丸으로 上海를 向하얏다. 幸혀 日本의 力을 依하야 朝鮮維新의 鴻業을 樹立코저 하다가 一旦亡命의 客ㅡ 안이 流竄의 몸이 되어 或은 小笠原孤의 島瘴氣中에서 或은 北海島의 風雪 中에서 前後 10餘年을 放浪하다가 「不足與爲」의 最後斷案을 得하고 失望에 失望ㅡ 안이 失望의 一種 反動으로 扶桑國과 永別을 告하는 當時 先生의 情懷가 果何如하얏슬가 더욱 當時를 距하기 26年 後 今日의 吾人으로써 見하면...

嗚呼!! 上海埠頭의 慘血
舟中人은 銃을 견우는 敵國이것마는 海上의 天氣는 異常하게도 溫靜하야 神戶를 發한 西京丸은 27日 午後 無事히 上海에 着하얏다. 旅館은 米租界에 在한 日本人 經營＜49＞ 東和洋行으로 定하고 先生과 和田은 2層의 1號室, 洪은 同 2號室의 順序로 投宿하얏다. 翌 28日은 午後 1時부터 居留地 求景次로 馬車 3臺를 求하야 午前은 各各 外出하얏다가 和田은 先歸하고 先生은 水陸長程에 頗히 疲困을 感하야 脫上衣하고 寢臺에 臥하야 犬養木堂에게서 持來한 左傳을 耽讀하얏다. 此際 外出하얏던 洪도 歸館하야 直히 從來의 洋服을 朝鮮服으로 換着하고 先生의 居室을 徘徊하는 等 그 行動이 異常하얏다. 그러나 先生은 依然히 讀書에 耽하다가 忽然 名啣 1枚를 和田에게 주며 그것을 松本西京丸長에게 傳하라 하매 和田은 命敎에 依하야 門外로 出하얏다. 和田의 跫音이 稍遠하야짐을 察한 洪은 準備하얏던 六穴砲를 出하야 先生을 擊하얏는데 그 第一發은 多幸히 先生의 左頰을 犯하매 先生은 蹶起하야 兇漢을 邀擊코저 하얏스나 空手이엇스며 洪의 發한 第二丸은 先生의 腹部를 犯하얏다. 名啣을 들고 2層으로 下去하던 和田은 砲聲이 連發함을 聞하고 곳 2層으로 上하려 할 際에 洪은 喘息赤眼으로 急下한다. 何等의 兇變이 生한 줄을 直覺하고 倉荒히 馳上한 즉 果然 先生이 門前에 昏倒되고 鮮血이 身邊에 淋漓하얏다. 和田은 그 昏倒한 先生을 일으켜 안고 『先生님 先生님』을 連方 哀號하얏스나 아모 氣跡이 업섯다. 아아!! 先生의 英靈은 旣히 現世를 去하얏도다. 아아 先生의 聲咳는 이 世間에서 永遠히 沈默하얏도다. 年自弱冠으로 志를 興國의 大業에 委하고 東奔西走로 그 生을 九死의 路에 苦하다가 그 業이 未半한 中途ㅡ 異域의 孤魂을 成하얏도다. 前途의 多艱을 先生이 旣히 豫測치 안은 바 안일지오 偉人從古多慘劇을 우리가 모름이 안이나 先生의 最後가 이러케까지 悲慘할 줄이 잇스리요. 維新의 基柱가 끈허졋스니 새 집의 上樑을 何에 求하며 迷津의 燈臺ㅡ그믈엇스니 鷄林의 兄弟 어대로 갈거나. 東和樓上에 海風이 尙寒한데 피다르고 말 갓지 안이한 和田의 어린 書生 한 사람뿐이다. 다 식은 先生을 精神업시 끌어안고 痛哭罔措할 뿐ㅡ 오호 甲午 3月 28日 午後!! 是時 先生의 春秋는 겨우 44歲이며 距今二十有六年前.
先生 遭亂의 報가 中外에 發布되매 世人의 憤慨와 同情은 恰然히 此에 注하얏다. 特히 日本 諸新聞紙는 論調가 非常히 激烈하야 此를 號外로 天下에 告知하며 先生 生前의 內外國 知友들은 此의 善後策을 講키 爲하야 金氏友人會를 組織하고 爲先 遺骸收拾次로 齋藤新一郞 岡本柳之助를 上海에 派遣하얏다. 兇漢 洪은 事件 發生의 翌日 米國警官에게 逮捕되며 上海列國領事는 在北京列國公使를＜50＞ 經하야 支那總理衙門을 向하야 『洪을 相當한 罪刑에 處하고 韓國政府와 交涉하야 先生의 屍體를 凌辱치 못할 條件下에 韓國으로 送還하라』고 要求하얏스나 先生 暗殺을 慫憊한 李鴻章은 此要求를 不採할 뿐 안이라 反히 上海道臺某에게 訓電하야 洪鍾宇를 十分 保護하야 金의 屍體와 共히 軍艦으로 韓國에 送歸하라 內命하얏다. 先生의 遺骸를 收拾키 爲하야 東京友人會로서 來한 諸氏는 直히 西京丸長과 交涉하야 郵船으로 遺骸를 日本에 移奉하기로 하고 幾日을 經한 某日 朝靈柩를 埠頭에까지 移하얏는데 忽然 居留地官憲으로부터 靈柩의 出航을 不許함으로 그 官憲과 共히 領事館에 往하야 그 理由를 探하고 歸한즉 靈柩는 去處가 無하얏다. 一同 特히 和田은 放聲痛哭하얏스나 靈柩는 旣히 支那官憲의 手에 入하야 洪과 共히 軍艦으로써 仁川에 搭送하얏다. 事旣至此에 岡本 等도 如何히 할 수 無하고 東京으로 空歸하매 友人會에서는 靈牌를 設하야써 靑山에 埋하야 哀悼의 意를 表하얏더라.
先生의 遺骸가 仁川으로 京城에 入하매 李鴻章은 朝廷에 向하야 長文의 祝電을 發來하얏스며 守舊一派의 喜悅은 極에 達하야 大히 洪鍾宇의 功을 賞하얏다. 京城駐在 各國 公使는 更히 朝廷에 向하야 先生 遺軆에 陵辱을 加함이 不可함을 累勸하얏스나 그것은 聽而不聞하고 4月 14日 京城의 南 約 40里 許漢江岸 楊花津頭에서＜51＞ 大逆不道의 罪名으로 八裂의 慘刑을 追行하야 首는 京城에 裊示하고 四肢는 各道에 廻示하고 軀軆는 漢江에 投하얏다 하며 或은 그대로 放乘하고 그의 收拾을 嚴禁하야 蠅犬의 吸噬에 委하얏다 한다. 嗚呼라 千古國士의 身上에 大逆不道의 名을 加하며 先하야 그의 家族을 滅하고 後하야 그를 銃殺이 오히려 不足하야 死後의 凌辱을 追加하얏도다. 그 兇惡이 果如何한가. 是時 甲斐軍治라는 日本人이 窃히 先生의 遺髮과 屍衣를 盜取하야 東京本鄕眞淨寺에 埋葬하얏더라.(數年前에 現 保寧郡守로 잇는 先生의 養子 金英鎭氏로부터 東京의 先生 遺髮을 移하야 牙山에 安葬하얏더라.

多方面으로 見한 先生의 性格
先生의 實蹟을 簡單히 적엇도다. 이제 先生을 다시금 追慕하는 情을 不堪하야 專히 先生의 性格 其他에 就하야 探問한 대로 적고자 한다.(先生을 隨하야 海外에서 多年 苦楚를 分한 某氏의 말슴에 依함)
先生은 第一 愛의 人이엇다. 그는 사람이나 物을 對할 時는 直히 그 本體 그 眞髓에 歸하야 그 純粹를 發見할 뿐이오 그 表面에 露出하는 그 무엇이라 함과 如한 觀念은 眼中에 初無하얏다. 先生의 心中에는 大人이 無하고 小兒가 無하얏스며 因習이 無하고 惰力이 無하얏스며 그저 사람이 有하고 眞實이 有하얏슬 뿐이엇다. 『누구이나 來하여라 내 손목 여긔 잇노라』함은 그의 待人第一主義이엇다. 그래 自幼時로 同侔들과 從遊할 時에도 別로 溫情을 注하야 鄕黨幼少年이 全혀 그를 戴하얏다 하며 京城養家에 入하야 現 高等普通學校 跡에 잇슬 時는 그 前家에 金弘集이 居住하야 朝暮相遊하얏는데 弘集이 家貧하야 食事가 粗함을 見한 어린先生은 이것이 心中에 不安하야 自己 食床이 來하면 必히 此를 分하야 庭垣 우흐로 弘集에게 보내엇다 하며 그의 仁風은 成長함과 共히 益濃하야 東京에 滯留할 時에는 日訪하는 書生들에게 滿幅의 同情을 表하야 或 100圓 或 10圓 그리하다가 金錢이 或 乏하면 窃히 自己의 旅具를 質하야 그의 憐情에 售하얏스며 先生의 最後를 侍한 和田과 如한 人은 小笠原에 謫居할 時 偶然히 알게 되어(和田의 그 때 9歲) 此를 極히 愛撫하야 或養或敎에 愛撫을 極히 한 바 그는 그 恩愛에 感하야 最後까지 先生의 側을 侍함이라 하며 先生은 일즉 儒敎를 形式의 敎라 하야 철알기부터 此를 排斥하고 佛敎를 篤信하야 先生의 修養과 博識은 多히 此에서 得하얏스며 오즉 形式을 忘하고 사람을 사람 그대로 對하는 先生은 友情이 別로 深하야 魚允中
徐光範 等 同志 十數人의 先生에게 心腹한 것은 勿論이오 東京에＜52＞ 亡命한 時 日本 幾多名士와 相從할새 一次面對하면 곳 知友가 되어 憂樂을 共分한 중 福澤諭吉, 頭山滿, 犬養毅 等과는 別로 莫逆의 間이엇다 한다.
그리고 先生은 溫厚暢達의 人이엇다. 小事에는 當初에 是非를 不爭하며 自己의 私事關係로 因하야 疾言遽色을 發함과 如한 事는 追逐者 何人이라도 發見치 못하얏다 한다. 詩書에 耽하며 風流를 好하고 且圍碁에 長하야 日本에 在할 時는 當地의 棋士의 來訪이 頻煩하얏는데 先生은 對手側의 如何한 人에게 對하야도 勝을 取하는 事가 無하며 最後까지 談笑 中에 勝負相半을 現케 하얏다. 傍人이 그 理由를 問하면 圍碁라 함은 遊具이니 最終까지 圓滿히 遊하얏스면 그의 最善을 盡한 것이라 거긔에 何特勝負를 出하야 적게나마 對手側의 感情을 亂케 할 必要가 何有한가 하야 先生은 他人의 感情을 그대로 살림을 最喜하얏스며 恒曰 自己의 運命에 無關한 凡凡小事에 自他의 感情을 傷함과 如함은 余의 本性의 不許하는 바라 하얏스며 且金錢의 觀念은 念頭에 初無하야 一自甲申事變 以後 全家가 滅盡되고 日本으로 亡命하야 東京에 留할 當時 隻分이 手中에 存할 理가 無한지라. 그러나 能히 交際하고 能히 施慈하야 北海道의 謫居時를 除한 外에는 少毫 金錢의 累를 學한 事가 無하얏나니 是는 勿論 先生의 人格을 慕하는 諸知友의 喜贈에 因함이라. 某 商店 或 料理館에 支拂할 額이 有하면 문득 2枚의 書信을 出하니 若第一受信人에게 不幸 所持金이 無하면 第二受信人을 訪하라 함이다. 그 受信人이라고 先生에게 債務를 負한 人은 勿論 안이며 오즉 先生의 知友가 될 뿐이다. 그러하나 先生의 그 2枚 書信은 小切手以上의 効가 有하얏다 함과 如함은 足히 先生의 用錢法을 窺할 것이다.
先生은 實로 無雙한 天才이엇다. 第一 聰明이 超逸하야 能詩能書하며 日本에 亡命한지 不過 3個月에 日本語를 精通하얏다. 이런 말이 잇다. 엇던 날 所看事가 有하야 犬養과 共히 鐵道會社長 小野某를 訪問하얏는데 禮畢에 先生은 例의 流暢한 口調로 一場談論을 試하고 犬養은 時時 此에 對辯할 뿐인 바 先生의 談이 終하매 主人된 小野는 犬養을 向하야 日本語의 巧妙를 嘆賞하며 『足下의 日本語는 언제 그리 硏究한 것인가』 試問하매 滿場이 大笑하얏다 하며 또 宴會席에 會員이 如何히 多數일지라도 한번 人事를 經하면 그 후 何時이라도 그의 顔과 名을 共記하며 且 先生은 如何한 人에게 發하는 修書라도 閣筆再考하는 事가 絶無하다. 그런데 先生의 42歲 時(壬辰)例의 北遊問題로＜53＞ 李鴻章에게 修書할새 그래도 李가 李이오 內容이 重大함으로 書畢에 此를 再見하얏는데 不幸一字를 落함이 有한지라. 先生이 喟然히 在傍友人에게 『余亦衰하얏도다』의 嘆을 漏하얏다 한다.
그리고 先生은 더 말할 수 업는 改革兒이엇스며 創造兒이엇다. 外部에 浮上한 虛僞를 見함에 止치 안이하고 必히 物의 聖髓에 觸하는 性을 有한 先生으로는 自然히 그러치 안인치 못하얏다. 이러한지라 或 事爲에 加工하야 完美를 告함과 如함은 先生의 長能이 안이라 朴泳孝씨와 如함은 當時 先生과 萬事를 同謀하얏스되 그 長能은 先生과 正反對로 創造보다 或事의 修成에 在하얏나니 要컨대 兩璧이 相須하야 朝鮮의 維新을 策함이다.
先生은 常히 和平과 悅樂으로 身을 持하야 幾年을 同居한 人으로도 先生의 無聊臥床을 不見하얏다 한다. 無時로 書繪를 鍊하며 或은 古人의 詩歌를 吟하며 或은 隣居의 幼少年라 談美作樂하며 그러치 안으면 校外에 策을 散하는 等 一時라도 無聊히 度過하는 事는 無하며 且人을 委訪함과 如한 事는 殆히 無하고 人으로 하야곰 自己를 訪하게 하며 그리하되 先生의 所過處에는 恒常 市를 成하얏스며 志가 大에 在한 先生은 自奉과 如함은 스스로 不許하야 至近한 親友이라도 그의 生日이 何日인지를 不知하얏다. 險惡한 運命을 目前에 控하고 支那로 向코저 하던 甲午春에 先生이 1日은 同留 柳赫魯 其他 2,3人을 向하야 一夜의 宴樂을 請함으로 應從한 事가 有하얏는데 上海慘禍가 有한 後에 생각하면 그 날이 即 先生의 生日이엇다 함은 當夜에 參席하얏던 現存 某 知友의 눈물지우며 하는 말이다. 耶穌基督이 十字架에 就할 當夜에 弟子들을 携하고 橄欖山에 登한 古事와 異調同曲이라고 할가나.
寬厚暢達의 先生은 꽤 戱謔에도 耽하얏다. 亡命으로 처음 東京에 着하얏슬 時는 人力車를 乘하면 近遠을 不問하고 1圓, 或 10圓, 或 100圓 손에 쥐이는 그대로 與하야 或 狂人이 안인가 하는 評도  得하얏스며 언제는 伊藤博文과 共히 修禪寺 溫泉場에 往하야 大川旅舘에 入하얏다. 翌朝同舘을 發할 새 茶代로 伊藤이 500圓을 出함으로 先生은 一躍 1,000圓을 出하야 只今까지 當地의 逸話가 되엇다는 말도 잇다.
世機에 敏한 先生은 平常 例語 中에도 發한 語도 무슨 豫言가티 된 말도 적지 안이하다. 江原道의 金剛山ㅡ 하면 只今은 世界的 名地가 되어 內外國人의 遊賞이 接踵하나 四五十年 前의 當時는 오즉 金剛의 名뿐이엇다. 先生은 戱語가티＜54＞ 朝鮮에서 外國人의 金을 奪할 것은 오즉 金剛이라. 金剛은 不出 20年에 朝鮮의 金江이 되리라 하얏스며 又曰 京城은 적어도 漢江이 京城全市를 流하는 時에 始로 新生活의 序幕이 開하리라 하얏다. 今日에 在하야 見하면 皆適中한 듯 하며 又曰 朝鮮의 首府를 平安 以北으로 移치 안이하면 朝鮮의 大成은 期키 難하며 그리고 偉大한 民族性을 養치 못하리라 하얏다 하는 바 此亦 偶然한 말슴이 안인 듯 하다. 此外에도 先生의 남긴 逸事逸話는 限이 無할 것이나 探知키 難한 點도 有하며 且現에 傳하는 것이라도 根據가 不確한 嫌이 有함으로 逸話는 이만 畧하고

結辭가티 한마디
先生은 西歐 風潮가 막 드리밀리고 東洋의 長眼이 겨우 깨고저 하는 19世紀 末葉에 幸가 不幸가 其生을 多艱多頑한 朝鮮半島에 禀하야 鬼神가튼 明見과 河海가튼 理想을 夙懷하고 斷斷 其盟으로 如何히 하면 二千萬의 民族을 黑洞 洞中에서 引出하며 如何히 하면 三千里 朝鮮을 世界的 沈淪으로부터 拯濟할가 하야 內로 頑冥無覺한 守舊黨과 挑戰하며 外로 1日의 長을 有한 日本과 手를 握하야 着着히 巨手를 漢城 一隅에 下하던 中 計左力弱하야 所期의 萬一을 不達하고 空히 異域風霜에 萍蓬의 몸이 되어 前後 10年은 落日出月에 前後 피끌코 속태이다가 最後 一縷의 希望을 支那에 繫하고 憔顇한 그 形軀를 上海埠頭에 옴기자마자 凶惡한 刺客의 一擊 下에 萬里孤魂을 作하고 已하얏도다. 鞠躬盡瘁되어 死而後乃已이라 하면 先生의 境遇에 庶幾할는지? 아아 念이 此에 至하매 感淚ㅡ自先하야 무엇이라 形喩할 길이 업도다. 別로 그리우는 先生의 性格에나 對하야 數行을 加記하고 느낌만흔 이 記錄을 마치자.
先生은 至仁至誠 多才多智 毅魄大膽 寬和暢達의 世界的 偉人(記者의 懇願이오니 徒히 先生을 誇讚하는 形容이라 생각지 마시오)이다. 그 襟懷에는 언제던지 光風霽月이 宿하며 그의 胸底에는 自由 偉大의 心腸이 備하얏고 그 日常의 言語에는 一種 特有의 語調를 帶하야 高邁醇眞한 中에도 明快靈活ㅡ正히 詩風의 著色이 有하야 處處에 異彩를 放하는 바 誰이나 此에 接하면 直히 偉大ㅡ 友愛에 濃한 人임을 感知하며 先生의 幼少年에 對한 愛는 正히 그 心底에 藏한 一切愛情의 簡單한 縮圖이엇는 듯. 아아 一方에는 可恐할 死의 挑戰이 有하고 他方으로는 如此한 至愛의 流不絶이 有함! 是偉人의 兩極이라고 할가나!＜55＞ 世間一切의 雄大ㅡ 全혀 此間에 鍾하얏도다. 이뿐만 안이라 事에 臨하야 明辨不急하며 人을 待하되 純實無僞함은 正히 輕裝小艇이 多島海間을 縫出하는 듯 하며 滾滾淸泉이 岩穴로부터 流出함과 如하얏도다. 一言으로 蔽하노니 吾人은 事業의 點에서뿐 안이라 亦 人格의 點에서 先生을 朝鮮 近代의 大産物ㅡ 안이 世界的 偉人이라면 그리 못한 것이 업다 하노라. 即 智로서나 仁으로서나 才로서나 誠으로서나 勇으로서나 悉皆大의 大, 醇의 醇, 吾人의 最尊敬, 最愛慕할 人物의 一人은 오즉 先生 뿐이라 한다. 果然하다. 그 大이야말로 한 層 두 層 置重하야 成한 方尖塔의 大가 안이오 白頭山의 上上峰과 如히 全혀 大를 强期치 안이하고 自然히 大한 것이며 그 醇이야말로 一草에 一木을 加하야 致한 庭園公園의 醇이 안이오 大地의 雨露에 스스로 成한 鴨祿邊 大森林의 醇과 如한 醇이라 彼其大를 欲하고 其醇을 裝하야 羊의 가죽쓰고 世間에 立한 俗偉人과는 實로 天壤의 判이 有하도다 그 境遇!!
아아 先生의 그 偉績 그 性格 今世來世萬萬世 우리 兄弟 안이 天下 億兆蒼生의 느낌, 生命되기에 足하리로다.
先生을 愛慕함이 極한 마음으로 唐突이 이 글을 草하얏스나 參考가 完全치 못하고 印刷時日도 頗急하야 杜撰이 만흘 것이웨다. 追後 發見하는대로 考訂且補記키로 하오며 삼가 우리의 머리 우에 洋洋히 臨하신 先生님과 밋 여러 愛讀 兄弟에게 謝意를 表하나이다.(記者)＜56＞
