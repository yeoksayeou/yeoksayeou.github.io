Research on In nae Ch'ŏn
						Yare
This is a continuation of the discussion from the previous issue concerning Dr. Takahashi Tōru's "Theory of the Three Teachings Regarding Korea," specifically addressing the section on Ch'oe Ch'i-wŏn's thought regarding the three teachings of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism (Sŏn).

Thus, it seems he held the idea of the unity of the three teachings (Samgyo Hap'il-lon). When he, by royal command, composed the inscription for the stele of Master Chin'gam at Hogye Temple, he spent several hundred words. He stated that although Confucianism and Buddhism differ in their outward forms, when it comes to the true essence of Śākyamuni and Confucius, their destinations are identical. Although he did not mention Taoism, applying this same logic to Taoism would not be inappropriate; thus, the theory of the fusion of two teachings becomes a theory of the fusion of three teachings.

Silla's Buddhism was transmitted to Koryŏ, where its flourishing was astonishing. During the Koryŏ Dynasty, Confucian scholars advocated the theory of the unity of the three teachings, but Buddhist monks did not. During the prosperous reign of Hyŏnjong in Koryŏ, the civil official Ch'ae Ch'ung-sun, while composing the inscription on the back of the Hyŏnhwa Temple stele, clearly stated the unity of the three teachings. He said that although the names of the three teachings differ, they originate from one source, their truths are internally fused, and their paths to enlightenment manifest externally. He also explained that the differences in the practices of the three teachings arise from the differing methods (Supo) of teaching and transforming sentient beings, and stated that truth precisely penetrates all three teachings. Like Ch'oe Ch'i-wŏn, he considered the teachings of Śākyamuni to be the most profound. Even during the late Koryŏ period, when Confucian studies gradually flourished, figures like Yi Mok-ŭn and Yi To-ŭn maintained close relationships with Buddhists and enjoyed discussing Buddhist scriptures. <71> Among them, Yi Mok-ŭn, a leading Confucian scholar of his time, advocated a theory of harmony between Confucianism and Buddhism. In his *Chŏgamgi* (Record of the Quiet Hermitage), he established quietude (寂, Chŏk) as the legitimate mind-method (心法, Simbŏp) transmitted since Fu Xi in Confucianism, discovering the harmony between Confucianism and Buddhism in this quietude. Also, in his *Sŏlsan'gi* (Record of Snow Mountain), he discovered the harmony of the two teachings in the cultivation of one's nature (養性, Yangsŏng).

Coming into the Yi Dynasty, after King T'aejong, the policy of rejecting Buddhism and venerating Confucianism (斥佛崇儒, Ch'ŏkpul Sung'yu) was primarily implemented. Consequently, Confucians studying Buddhist scriptures (內典, Naejŏn) almost disappeared entirely, and thus, the idea of Confucian-Buddhist harmony was largely outside the domain of Confucian scholars. However, after the Imjin War during King Sŏnjo's reign, people's minds became dispirited, and pessimistic, world-weary thought became prevalent. At such times, even wealthy individuals like Sin Sang-ch'on, indeed, even great successes in the official world, advocated a theory of harmony between Confucianism and Taoism. This, I think, arose from the inclination of people's minds seeking passive peace of mind and had no connection whatsoever with scholarship. Others, like Yi Yul-gok and No Su-jae, avidly read Buddhist scriptures and were somewhat influenced by Buddhism in their thought. However, they did not advocate a theory of Confucian-Buddhist harmony. While Confucian scholars after the mid-Yi Dynasty did not propose theories of Confucian-Buddhist harmony, let alone Confucian-Buddhist-Taoist unity, conversely, there were many Buddhist monks who advocated such ideas. The monk Sŏngwŏl Hwasang constantly argued against the irrationality of rejecting Buddhism when addressing Confucians, and simultaneously discussed comparisons between Zhu Xi's philosophy and Buddhist Dharma. He argued that Zhu Xi's concept of the pre-manifest state (未發, Mibal) of *ki* (氣) is the Buddhist principle of *tathatā* (如如, Yŏyŏ); Zhu Xi's Supreme Ultimate (太極, T'aegŭk) is the Buddhist 'One Thing' (一物, Ilmul); Zhu Xi's 'Principle is One, Manifestations are Many' (理一分殊, Iil Punsu) is the Buddhist 'One Mind Square' (一心方, Ilsim Pang); therefore, how could there be a distinction between Confucianism and Buddhism? He thus forcefully argued for harmony. Furthermore, Hwaak Hwasang has a poem on the single origin of the three teachings (三敎一元, Samgyo Irwŏn), which reads:
"The Ancient Sages divided the Three Teachings. / Their root is the One True Origin. / Meeting tonight on Tano day. / People divided before the end of Teachings." Also, in Mugam Hwasang's reply letter to Scholar Im, <72> the unity of Confucianism and Buddhism (儒釋一致, Yusŏk Ilch'i) was discussed. In Paekkok Ch'ŏnŭng's memorial pleading against the rejection of Buddhism, there was also a theory of Confucian-Buddhist unity. Inak Hwasang's reply letter to Nolch'on similarly contained such a theory. In essence, during the Silla and Koryŏ periods, theories of the unity of the three teachings or two teachings arose from the Confucian side, whereas in the Yi Dynasty, these theories frequently arose from the Buddhist (釋氏, Sŏkssi) side. From this, one can ascertain the traces of the rise and fall of Confucianism and Buddhism.

In the 14th year of King Chŏljong, Kyŏngsin year (1860), on the 5th day of the 4th month, Ch'oe Su-un of Kyŏngju, under the pretext of countering the spread of Catholicism (耶穌敎, Yasugyo), founded the Tonghakkyo (東學敎, School of Eastern Learning), actually championing the unity of the three teachings. He declared that he took the strengths of the three teachings, synthesized them, and established "Our Teaching" (吾敎, Ogyo). In his exhortation to his high disciple Ch'oe Si-hyŏng, he taught: "Establishing order and clarifying ethics (立綱明倫), dwelling in benevolence and practicing righteousness (居仁行義), sincerity of intent and correctness of mind (意誠心正)," extending from the self to the world – this is the Way of Confucianism (儒道, Yudo). "Relinquishing relics and prohibiting desire (捨利禁慾), propagating enlightenment and saving the world (宣化救世)," purifying the place of practice (道場, Tojang), chanting spells (呪, Chu), and holding prayer beads (念珠, Yŏmju) in hand – this is the Way of Buddhism (佛道, Puldo). "Investigating the profound and examining emptiness (究玄 校無)," eliminating honor and disgrace, chewing on (savoring) the pure and subtle (淸妙, Ch'ŏngmyo) truth (嚼眞, Chakchin) – this is the Way of Taoism/Immortals (仙道, Sŏndo). He stated that the three teachings are all encompassed within our doctrine, marking out a vast and boundless territory, causing Koreans far and wide to develop faith. (Omitted)
The discussion regarding the theory of the unity of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism in Korea begins with Ch'oe Ch'i-wŏn of Silla and ends with Ch'oe Su-un of the Yi Dynasty. Depending on the fortunes of Confucianism and Buddhism's rise and fall, Confucian scholars and Buddhists mutually advocated and responded to each other, attempting the fusion of the two teachings, and simultaneously sought to defend against the contempt of knowledgeable people. Ch'oe Su-un, with foresightful knowledge, opened a new religion that was neither Confucian, nor Buddhist, nor Taoist, ultimately gaining a million believers. Thus, <73> Confucian scholars and Buddhists, who had always sought to prop up the declining influence of their own teachings, could only resort to keeping their mouths shut (守口無言, Sukumuwŏn) upon reaching this point.

Mr. Takahashi Tōru's argument here, in historically examining the theory of the unity of the three teachings, can be said to have largely grasped its propriety. Indeed, the idea of the unity of the three teachings is the collective thought of the Korean people. At the same time, it is no exaggeration to say it is the collective ideal of East Asian people. Considering the millennia since Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism came into existence, East Asians have been deeply rooted in them, long receiving their ideals and culture. For East Asians to seek their unification is a necessary ideal and also a concluding truth (理諦, Ich'e), is it not? If so, the Great Divine Teacher's (大神師, Tae Sinsa) unification of the three teachings being realized in fact and sweeping the world should also not be called a strange event, but rather a natural and necessary fact, manifested through the Great Divine Teacher's great personality. However, under what kind of ideal did the Great Divine Teacher unify the three teachings? This is truly a question for research.

After the Great Divine Teacher's Great Awakening (大覺, Taegak) on the 5th day of the 4th month, Kyŏngsin year (1860), responding to his disciple's question, he said, "My Way is the Heavenly Way (天道, Ch'ŏndo)." Thus, he declared, "My Way is a matter unheard of in the present, unheard of in the past; a law incomparable in the present, incomparable in the past." According to this declaration, the Great Divine Teacher's unification of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism was not a hodgepodge (骨董飯的, Koltongbanjŏk) fusion achieved by comparing and citing elements from each of their doctrines. Rather, it must have been that under some new ideal, their unification came about. In other words, the Great Divine Teacher's unity of the three teachings was not something the Great Divine Teacher strongly sought to unify. Instead, as a result of spiritual practice, at the culmination of the Great Awakening, some ideal manifested itself, and as a result of analyzing that manifested ideal, he first realized (始覺, Sigak) that Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism were each a part of that ideal. Isn't that likely the case? <74>

**Summary**

This article by Yare continues a discussion on Takahashi Tōru's theory of the "Three Teachings" (Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism) in Korea. It traces the historical development of the idea of unifying these three teachings (Samgyo Hap'il), starting from Ch'oe Ch'i-wŏn in Silla, through various Confucian scholars in Koryŏ (like Ch'ae Ch'ung-sun, Yi Mok-ŭn), and noting a shift during the Yi Dynasty where Buddhist monks (like Sŏngwŏl, Hwaak, Paekkok) became the primary proponents of harmony or unity, while Confucian scholars generally distanced themselves due to the state policy favoring Confucianism. The author presents Ch'oe Su-un, the founder of Tonghak (Eastern Learning), as the culmination of this tradition. Yare argues that Ch'oe Su-un's teaching, based on the principle of "In nae Ch'ŏn" (Man is Heaven), achieved a unique synthesis originating from a profound personal realization (Great Awakening), rather than a mere eclectic combination, effectively subsuming the three traditions under a new, higher ideal rooted in Korean thought and fulfilling a broader East Asian aspiration. From a historical perspective, the article is interesting as it reflects Korean intellectual engagement with Japanese scholarship during the colonial period (1920). It discusses a uniquely Korean religious movement, Tonghak, framing its founder Ch'oe Su-un and his "In nae Ch'ŏn" philosophy as a significant, internally developed culmination of a long historical trend, subtly asserting cultural continuity and distinctiveness.

人乃天의 硏究
						夜雷
이것은 前號의 文學博士 高橋亨氏의 朝鮮에 對한 三敎論의 續인데 即 崔致遠 先生의 儒佛仙三敎에 對한 思想 一節을 쓰던 끗이다.

그러한즉 그 思想에 三敎合一論을 抱하엿슬지로다. 그가 王命에 依하야 護溪寺의 眞鑑大師의 碑銘을 製할 새 數百言을 費하엿섯다. 儒佛二敎가 그 形跡에 對하야 相異하엿스나 釋迦孔子의 眞髓에 이르러는 其歸가 一致하다 하엿도다. 비록 그가 道敎는 말하지 안이 하엿스나 이를 道敎에 移할지라도 無妨할지니 곳 二敎融合論은 三敎融合論이 될지라.
新羅의 佛敎는 곳 高麗에 傳한 바 되어 그 全盛이 놀남즉 하엿도다. 高麗朝에 至하야 儒者는 三敎合一論을 唱하엿스되 僧侶는 이를 唱치 안이하엿나니 高麗의 盛代ㅡ顯宗 時의 文臣 蔡忠順이 玄化寺碑陰記를 製할새 三敎合一을 明言하고 三敎 各名을 異케 하엿스나 一源에 出하야 그 眞理가 內融하야 化門外顯되엇다 하엿스며 또한 三敎의 迹이 不同함은 衆生敎化의 手報가 相異함으로 因함이라 하고 眞理가 正히 三敎를 一貫한다 述하엿나니 그도 崔致遠과 가티 釋씨의 說로써 가장 高遠하다 하엿나니라. 麗末에 儒學이 漸興함에 及한 時에도 李牧隱, 李陶隱 等은 佛徒와 親密히 交際함과 同時에 佛典을 講하기를＜71＞ 조와하얏도다. 就中 李牧隱은 一代의 儒宗으로 儒佛調和의 說을 唱하엿나니 寂菴記에는 寂으로써 儒家 庖羲氏 以來ㅡ 嫡傳의 心法을 삼아 寂에서 儒佛의 調和를 發見하엿고 又 雪山記에는 養性에서 二敎의 調和를 發見하엿도다.
李朝에 이르러 太宗 以後 斥佛崇儒의 政策을 主하야 實行함으로 儒로써 內典을 硏究하는 者ㅡ 거의 絶無하엿스며 딸아서 儒佛調和의 思想은 殆히 儒者의 境域以外이엇더라. 그러나 宣祖의 壬辰大役 以後 人心이 萎靡되어 厭世的 思想이 流行할새 申象村 가튼 富貴者, 안이라 官界의 大成功者로도 儒敎道敎調和의 說을 唱하엿나니 이는 생각건대 人心의 傾向이 消極的 安心을 求함으로써요 學問과는 何等 交涉이 업섯도다. 其他론 李栗谷, 盧蘇齋와 가튼 이가 佛典을 耽讀하야 思想上 얼마간 佛敎의 影響을 受하엿나니라. 그러하나 儒佛調和의 說을 唱함은 업섯도다. 李朝 中世 以後 儒者가 儒佛調和 乃至 儒佛仙合一의 論을 立案함이 업는 바 反面에는 僧侶로써 이를 唱하는 者ㅡ 甚多하엿도다. 霜月和尙은 恒常 儒者에 對하야 斥佛無理를 辨함도 잇스며 同時에 朱子哲學과 佛法의 比較論을 하엿나니 곳 朱子의 未發의 氣象은 佛家의 如如의 理요 朱子의 太極은 佛家의 一物이오 朱子의 理一分殊는 佛家의 一心方인즉 무엇으로 儒佛의 別이 잇스랴 하고 이에 調和를 力說하엿스며 또는 華嶽和尙에게 三敎一元의 詩가 잇스니 가르되
先聖分三敎. 其本一元眞. 端陽今夜會. 敎末分前人. 又黙菴和尙의 答任進士書에도＜72＞ 儒釋一致를 論하엿고 白谷處能의 斥佛을 諫하는 上䟽에도 釋儒一致說이엇섯스며 仁岳和尙의 答訥村書에도 同樣의 說이엇섯나니 要컨대 新羅 高麗 때에는 儒佛仙三敎, 二敎合一論이 儒者의 側에서 생기엇고 李朝에 이르러는 是論이 자조 釋氏의 側에서 생겻슨즉 이로써 儒釋二敎의 盛衰의 跡을 究明할 수 잇스리라.
哲宗 14年 庚申 4月 5日 慶州의 崔水雲은 耶穌敎의 蔓延을 禦하는 名目 下에서 東學敎를 創開할새 實로 三敎合一을 標榜하엿더라. 곳 三敎의 長을 取하야 이를 集成하고 吾敎를 세운다 宣言하엿나니 그의 傳統의 高弟 崔時亨에게 誥하는 辭에 가르대 「立綱明倫 居仁行義 意誠心正」 몸으로부터 世에 及함은 儒道가 이것이오 「捨利禁慾 宣化救世」 道場을 淸淨히 하야 呪를 唱하며 念珠를 손에 함은 佛道가 이것이오 「究玄 校無」 榮辱을 除破하고 淸妙를 嚼眞함은 仙道가 이것이라 하고 三敎가 共히 우리 敎理에 攝하야 廣大無量한 地步를 点하야 널리 朝鮮人으로 하야곰 信仰을 일으키게 하는 바이라.(중략)
朝鮮에 對한 儒佛仙合一論에 新羅의 崔致遠으로부터 始하야 李朝의 崔水雲에 이르러 終하엿도다. 儒佛盛衰의 運에 依하야 儒者佛者가 互相唱和하야 二敎의 融化를 圖하엿고 同時에 識者의 侮를 禦코저 하엿도다. 崔水雲이 先見의 識으로 非儒非佛非仙의 一新宗敎를 開하야 畢竟은 百萬의 信徒를 得하엿슨즉 恒常 自敎의 頹勢를 扶持하고저 하던 바＜73＞ 儒者及佛者는 이에 이르러는 오즉 守口無言에 附할 밧게 업게 되엇나니다.
高橋亨씨의 此論은 歷史的으로 三敎合一論을 考證함에 자못 그 宜를 得하엿다 할지라. 果然 三敎合一의 思想은 朝鮮人의 全體 思想이라. 同時에 東洋人의 全體 理想이라 하야도 過言이 안이로다. 思컨대 儒佛仙의 잇서온 以來ㅡ 數千載의 光陰에 東洋人은 此에 根底가 深하엿고 그 理想 그 文化를 蒙한지 久하엿나니 東洋人으로 이를 統一코저 함은 必然의 理想이며 又 歸結의 理諦가 안인 것이냐. 然하면 大神師의 三敎統一이 事實로 實現되어 一世를 風靡케 됨도 또한 奇怪의 事라 云치 못할 것이오 當然又必然의 事實, 大神師의 偉大한 人格에 依하야 諦現하엿다 할지로다. 然한데 大神師는 如何한 理想으로써 三敎를 統一하엿슬가 是實로 硏究의 問題로다.
大神師ㅡ 庚申 4月 5日ㅡ大覺하신 後ㅡ 그 徒弟의 問에 應하야 曰 吾道는 天道니라. 그리하야 吾道는 今不聞古不聞之事요 今不比古不比之法이라 宣言하셧나니 此宣言에 依하면 大神師의 儒佛仙統一은 儒佛仙 各其의 敎理를 比附援引하야 骨董飯的으로 此를 融合한 것이 안이오 엇던 新한 理想의 下에서 이를 合一케 된 것일지로다. 換言하면 大神師의 儒佛仙合一은 大神師가 强히 그를 合一코저 함이 안이오 修煉의 結果 大覺의 究竟ㅡ 엇던 理想이 表顯되엇고 그 表顯된 理想을 解剖한 結果ㅡ 儒佛仙이 各其 그 理想의 一部分인 것을 始覺하엿다 함일 것이 안인가.＜74＞
