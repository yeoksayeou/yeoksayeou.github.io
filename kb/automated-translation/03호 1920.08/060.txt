Children's Song of the Kangwŏn Province Region

Where have you gone? Still, still far away.
Where have you gone? Crossed the ditch (梁).
Where have you gone? Crossed the stream.

What did you eat to live? Ate pork (豚) to live.
With what chopsticks (箸) did you eat? Ate with iron chopsticks.
Who all ate? I ate alone.
Oink oink, oink oink.

The two verses above are a song popular in the Kangwŏn Province region. It is not known since what year it became popular, but it is true that it is a song from old times, and it is said that when the children (兄弟) of that region reach the age of about seven or eight, they often sing such songs and enjoy them. If one explores the original meaning (原義) of the song, the first verse depicts the path and state (狀態) of reaching a certain ideal (理想), and the latter verse confesses the recent state (近狀) of egoism (我利主義), thus both verses achieve the subtlety of satire (諷刺). How fortunate (多福하고녀) are the young boys and girls of the Kangwŏn Province region who sing morning and evening the meaningful songs passed down by their ancestors. <28>

**Summary**

This article presents a children's song from Kangwŏn Province, popular among young children. The song consists of two verses: the first describes a journey across obstacles, interpreted by the author as striving towards an ideal; the second describes eating pork alone with iron chopsticks, interpreted as a confession of egoism. The author praises the satirical depth of this traditional song and considers the children singing it fortunate to inherit such meaningful folklore. From a historical perspective, the article is interesting as it documents regional folklore during the colonial period and provides a contemporary interpretation linking it to social commentary (idealism vs. egoism). Historians might find the specific interpretation reflecting early 20th-century intellectual concerns, the effort to document and find deeper meaning in folk traditions, and the use of older Korean orthography valuable.

누구누구 먹엇나 내가 혼자 먹엇네
꿀꿀 꿀꿀
