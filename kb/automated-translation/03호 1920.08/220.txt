生活의 改造와 愛
						李駿錫

Is this not the modern age where new trends are spreading, and is this not today when a new spirit is circulating? Everywhere there is expansion, and everyone cries out for nothing but reconstruction.

However, can it be said that the purpose of reconstruction is achieved merely by destroying old habits and old systems found in form and building new habits and new systems?

Reconstruction is not limited to a single period or the superficial social phenomena. The true meaning of reconstruction cannot but be called the urgent priority of thoroughly renewing oneself individually and earnestly encouraging one's own heart.

Although reconstruction can be discussed from various aspects, finding a true method for living, which is most appropriate for us, can be called the most necessary reconstruction. In other words, although we have continued a life of sin and anguish until today, it lies in keenly feeling a happy life with a sudden awakening from today onwards. Then what will become the greatest dignity and glory of human life?

It is not that the growth of our knowledge and the development of philosophy, science, art, etc., do not become the dignity and glory of human life, but knowledge alone is difficult to call absolute and eternal for human happiness. Behind knowledge, there is something, namely Love (愛). True knowledge is that which is produced with Love as its mother.

Suppose you were to exist alone in the world. This world would be nothing more than a desolate desert. However, when two or more people gather, the natural exchange of Love opens between people, and soon this world will transform into a paradise.

Even considering Ch'ŏndogyo (天道敎) of our Chosŏn (朝鮮), which flows with the contemporary ideological currents as a new religion of the 20th century and conforms to the world's civilizing trends, let us reflect that its core principle is nothing other than *Sainyŏch'ŏn* (事人如天, Treating people like Heaven). Treating people like Heaven signifies the utmost degree of Love.

If we study the cause of all resentful thoughts and all class struggles (階級的 鬪爭), which are great problems of the modern era, it is nothing other than the two characters for jealousy (嫉妬). To solve this problem, various means and methods will ultimately find it difficult to turn back the势力 (勢力 - power/force) spreading like wildfire <90> and the waves flooding the heavens. I do not hesitate to assert that the simple and plain matter of sincere mutual love (實心相愛) alone can solve all of this.

The world is a vortex den of demons; human life is an engine of suffering (苦痛). Behind this demon and suffering, the god of light and joy surely lies hidden and free. Love is the sole key (關鍵) to discovering light and joy, the sole teacher revealing dignity and glory.

However, it is also imperative not to be ignorant that the life of Love is a life of extreme suffering (苦痛). Is it not suffering to overcome one's own greed and desire (利慾) and to rescue (拯救) others from drowning (陷溺)? But, being blameless (無怍) in looking up and down, receiving unseen help (陰助) from the divine spirits (神明), being loved by others as a reaction (反動) to loving one person, becoming a model (模範的) for all people through the compassion (慈悲) of one person, and becoming eternally continuous through momentary sympathy (惻隱) – how could this not be a life of supreme bliss (極樂)?

Moreover, human life is decidedly not lived for pleasure (享樂). Just as the world does not stop growing and evolving (生長進化) for even a minute or a second, it is a principle that human life also has no time (睱隙) to rest from creating life (生活創造) for even a minute or a second until the day of death.

Through that creation of life, one should seek the life of Love and obtain the beginning of joy. If from the start there were only perfect human lives, then no matter how lofty the life of Love, there would be nothing to praise—just as, by contrast, a bird inherently has wings (翅), so no matter how high it traverses the sky (高空), it is not called extraordinary (異常), but because humans without wings invented airplanes (飛行機) and soar (翶翔) beyond the heavens, the joy of creation first arises. Similarly, if we too wish to reconstruct a life of joy from a life of anguish (懊惱), it must lie in warming the cold world (寒冷世界) with Love and awakening the drunkenly sleeping life (醉眠人生) with Love. <91>

**Summary**

This editorial by Yi Chun-sŏk argues that true societal reconstruction (改造) requires more than superficial changes to systems or habits; it demands a fundamental inner transformation centered on Love (愛). Yi posits that Love is the source of true knowledge and the key to turning the world from a "desolate desert" into a "paradise." He connects this idea to the core tenet of Ch'ŏndogyo, *Sainyŏch'ŏn* (Treating people like Heaven), suggesting Love can resolve societal ills like class struggle, which stems from jealousy. While acknowledging the suffering involved in living a life of Love, Yi emphasizes its ultimate reward and its role as the driving force behind continuous life creation and human evolution, urging readers to warm the cold world and awaken sleeping humanity through Love.

From a historical perspective, the article is interesting for its focus on internal, spiritual reform ("reconstructing oneself") through "Love" as the primary means of societal change in colonial Korea, rather than focusing solely on political or economic resistance. The explicit mention and positive framing of Ch'ŏndogyo (天道敎) and its core principle *Sainyŏch'ŏn* is significant, reflecting the influence of this indigenous religion, which played a role in the nationalist movement (e.g., the March 1st Movement in 1919), as a potential source for moral and social renewal under colonial rule. The emphasis on overcoming individual suffering and jealousy to achieve collective harmony through Love offers insight into the philosophical and perhaps coping strategies discussed among Korean intellectuals during a period of national hardship.

生活의 改造와 愛
						李駿錫
新風潮가 波及되는 現代가 안이며 新氣運이 輪回하는 今日이 안인가. 곳곳마다 澎漲하고 사람마다 絶叫함은 改造뿐이로다.
然하나 改造라 함은 但히 形式에 發見된 舊習慣, 舊制度를 破壞하고 新習慣, 新制度를 建築함으로써 改造의 目的을 達하엿다 함이 可할가?
改造는 一時期에 限하야 表面的 社會現狀이 안이오. 眞意味의 改造는 各히 自身을 特別刷新하고 自心을 痛切激勵함이 改造의 急先務라 謂치 안이치 못할지라.
改造를 各方面으로 論할지나 吾人에게 最適切한 生活에 對하야 眞實한 生活의 方法을 見出함이 最히 必要한 改造라 謂할지라. 換言하면 今日까지 吾人은 罪惡과 煩惱의 生活을 繼續하얏지마는 今日부터는 幡然한 覺悟로 幸福스러운 生活을 痛切히 感함에 在한지라 然하면 何物이 最히 人生의 尊貴와 光榮이 될가?
吾人의 知識을 增長하야 哲學, 科學, 藝術等의 發展이 人生의 尊貴와 光榮이 되지 안임이 안이언마는 然하나 知識만으로는 人生幸福의 絶對的, 永久的이라 謂키 難하고 知識의 背影에 무엇하나이 잇스니 曰 愛라 하는 것이 곳 그것이라. 眞知識은 愛를 母로 삼아 産出한 者이니라.
設使 自己 1人으로만 世間에 存在케 되고 보라. 此世界는 荒涼한 沙漠에 不過할지라. 그러나 2人 以上이 集合할 時에는 人과 人의 間에 自然的 愛의 交通이 開하야 어느덧 此世界는 樂園으로 幻成할지니라.
20世紀 新宗敎로 現代 思潮에 順流되고 世界風化에 迎合된 우리 朝鮮의 天道敎로 論할지라도 그 宗旨는 事人如天에 不外함을 한번 생각할지어다. 人을 天과 如히 事함은 愛의 極度를 意味함이니라.
現代 大問題인 모든 不平的 思想과 모든 階級的 鬪爭이 그 原因을 硏究할지면 嫉妬 2字에 不外함이니 此問題의 解決에도 各種 手段方法으로는 到底히 燎原의＜90＞ 勢力과 淊天의 波動을 挽回키 難할지오. 簡易 平淡한 實心相愛的一事가 能히 此를 모다 解決하리라 斷言함을 憚치 안이하노라.
世界는 惡魔의 渦窟이오. 人生은 苦痛의 機關이라. 此 惡魔와 苦痛의 背影에 光明과 快樂의 神이 반듯이 潛하고 自在하나니 愛는 光明과 快樂을 見出하는 惟一關鍵이오. 尊貴와 光榮을 啓示하는 惟一敎師일지라.
그러나 愛의 生活은 非常한 苦痛의 生活임을 不知함이 또한 不可하니 自己의 利慾을 打勝하며 他人의 陷溺을 拯救함이 엇지 苦痛이 안이리오 마는 俯仰에 無作하야 神明이 陰助하며 一人을 愛하는 反動으로 人이 自己를 愛하며 一人의 慈悲로 萬人의 模範的이 되고 一時의 惻隱으로 永久의 繼續的이 되고 보면 엇지 極樂의 生活이 안이리오.
하물며 人生은 決코 享樂을 爲하야 生함이 아니라 世界는 1分 1秒이라도 生長進化의 停止할 時가 無함을 딸아서 人生도 또한 死日까지 一分一秒라도 生活創造를 休息할 睱隙이 無함이 原則이니라.
그 生活創造에 依하야 愛의 生活을 求할지오. 樂의 端緖를 得할지니 萬一 最初부터 完全한 人生뿐이라하면 아모리 高尙한 愛의 生活이라도 讚許할바-無하리니 譬컨대 鳥는 翅가 固有한 故로 아모리 高空을 橫斷하여도 異常이라 謂치 안이함에 反하야 翅가 無한 人이 飛行機를 發明하야 天外에 翶翔하는 故로 創造의 樂이 비롯오 生함과 如히 吾人도 또한 懊惱의 生活로부터 快樂의 生活을 改造코저할지면 모름즉이 寒冷世界를 愛로써 溫케 하고 醉眠人生을 愛로써 覺케 함에 在하다 하노라.＜91＞
