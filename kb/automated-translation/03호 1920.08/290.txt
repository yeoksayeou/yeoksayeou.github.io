Where Justice goes, there is no adversary. Justice is the Living God (산한울님). (P'ŭrassŭ) <100>

**Summary**

This brief entry is an aphorism asserting the supreme power of Justice (正義), stating it faces no opposition and equating it with the concept of "산한울님" (Living God), a term central to Cheondoism. The attribution to "P'ŭrassŭ" (likely Plato) lends philosophical weight. For historians, this piece, despite its brevity, is interesting as it reflects the idealistic and perhaps implicitly nationalistic sentiments prevalent in early colonial Korea, published in *Kaebyŏk*, a magazine known for its cultural and nationalist leanings. The equation of Justice with a native religious concept like "산한울님" is particularly noteworthy.
