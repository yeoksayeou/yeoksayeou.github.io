One cannot forget existence through living. Why? Because it is life for the sake of survival, not survival for the sake of life.

Fate is fate. It is an expression meaning "to revolve." That is, it means that perhaps the result revolves towards the one whose actions are worthy of receiving that result.

To say a person is valuable is because their labor efficiency is high. Among them, to say youth is the most valuable means their efficiency is at its peak. Therefore, to disregard labor is to defile one's own sacredness.

Why shouldn't a person be able to die when it is time to die? When I think of how that dreadful demon of illness becomes the sole butcher of our lives, instead of dying sacredly by some sacred hand...

Just as peaceful sleep in life comes to the one who has fully performed the day's activities, paradise after death (if it exists) will come to the one who has fully performed the activities of this life.

Nature's art created the wilderness, and human art created the city.

The face is the gate of the spirit, and also a spy, and also a portrait.

Great sin is the guardian deity of small evil.

A cat has 9 lives. However, does a woman have the lives of 9 cats?<33>

**Summary**

This untitled piece from the magazine *Kaebyŏk* presents a series of aphoristic reflections on life, fate, labor, death, nature, and human nature. It emphasizes that life's purpose is survival, fate rewards deserving actions, the value of individuals (especially youth) lies in their capacity for labor, and true rest (in life or after death) comes after full exertion. It contrasts nature's creation (wilderness) with human creation (city), describes the face as a reflection of the spirit, suggests large sins enable smaller ones, and ends with a playful comparison between the proverbial nine lives of a cat and the resilience of women. From a historical perspective, the emphasis on labor, particularly youth labor, resonates with the modernization and nationalist discourses prevalent in colonial Korea, framing productivity as a virtue. The musings on life, death, and fate, common in intellectual writings of the era, perhaps subtly reflect the constraints and existential questions faced under colonial rule. The use of mixed script (Hanja and Hangul) and older orthography is characteristic of the period.
