We, in order to manage great endeavors (大事業), must always become youth. (Goethe)

Youth is the most beautiful moment (瞬間) in the course of a lifetime (生涯). (Lacordaire)

Within the heart of youth, a magnificent palace (宮殿) lies quietly hidden (숨엇다). (Maupassant)

If youth has much happiness, then in proportion (比例) to that, it also has much fear. (Saint-Père)<91>

**Summary**

This short article compiles quotes from European thinkers (Goethe, Lacordaire, Maupassant, Saint-Père) defining the nature and significance of youth. Youth is presented as essential for achieving great things, the most beautiful part of life, possessing hidden potential, yet also marked by a fear proportional to its happiness. From the perspective of Korean colonial history, this piece, published in the influential magazine *Gaebyeok* in 1920, highlights the contemporary focus on youth as agents of change and national future. Historians might find it interesting how Western ideas were selectively used to inspire and characterize the role and spirit expected of young Koreans during a period of burgeoning nationalism and resistance.
