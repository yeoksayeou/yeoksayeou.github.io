Miscellaneous Notes from the Lake Region
Seeing the Problematic Lustful Demon Governor

It was January 19th. I went to the Provincial Office to visit the Governor of Ch'ungbuk Province, Pak Chungyang. Inside the main gate of the Provincial Office is the Provincial Simple Library, and to its west stands the Imjin War Victory Stele of Master Cho Chungbong. In the front courtyard, ginkgo trees (鴨脚樹) speaking of ancient history stand tall against the clouds, and within, the old, crumbling government building, exuding an air of antiquity, comes into view. The office attendant's room was separate, like a detached room between the gates. I first entered the Councilor's office, where the Councilor's nameplate was attached. Intending to rest for a moment, I opened the door, and lo and behold! It wasn't a press room but the Provincial Office's trash room (씨레기 間). Broken chairs were gathered and strewn about in every corner. It seemed cleaning hadn't been done since the old military camp (鎭營) days; charcoal dust, newspaper scraps, straw rope fragments, and all sorts of unclean, messy items were present. The glass windows and door frames were all broken, looking like a house after a goblin exorcism (독갑이굿). Feeling utterly embarrassed, I slammed the door shut and muttered to myself, "No matter how provincial the government office, if the so-called press room is like this, the rest can be imagined. Also, in Ch'ŏngju, there are twelve nominal newspaper offices, including Korean and Japanese ones, yet the reporters remain silent even after seeing this state. What authority could they possibly have?" Chuckling, I shifted direction and went straight into the Governor's private office's secretary room. I gave my name card to a certain Japanese provincial official and requested an audience with the Governor. Just then, a man in Western clothes also arrived and, bowing hundreds and thousands of times to the attendant, requested an audience with the Governor. Judging by his appearance, he seemed to be the advance dog (先發狗) of the so-called Siguk Taedongdan lecture team, planning a lecture meeting in Ch'ŏngju the next day and begging the Provincial Governor for protection. The provincial official went into the Governor's office and came out, then ushered both me and that man into the Governor's office together. Feeling slightly embarrassed, I pretended not to hear and waited a moment before entering alone. First, observing the Provincial Governor's physiognomy, compared to his age,<88> his body was very robust. In his gleaming eyes, the murderous aura from his time eradicating wild dogs in Taegu still lingered. His prominent nose bridge and ruddy complexion suggested he was forceful (强○잘하고), enjoyed drinking, and seemed quite deserving of nicknames like "Lustful Demon Governor" (色魔知事) or "Barley Wine Governor" (보리술知事). I greeted him, and he returned the courtesy, then requested my name card again. Government documents usually have originals and copies, but this was the first time I had to give two name cards. With a slightly displeased expression, I handed him another name card and asked if he hadn't seen the one I gave to the provincial official. He gave an incomprehensible (要領不得) reply and, in his usual Japanese, asked in return why I had come. I explained my reason for visiting in detail, but he replied that it would be better to discuss such matters with the respective departments rather than coming to him, and said nothing else. However, his attitude and demeanor, from his anus to the crown of his head, seemed filled with the presumptuous thought:

Pak Governor and the Controversial Pŏpchusa Temple at Songnisan Mountain, Poŭn County

"Even so, in the past, I would have been the Ch'ungch'ŏng Provincial Governor (忠淸監司), or at least the Ch'ungbuk Provincial Observer (忠北觀察使). Even now, I am His Excellency the Provincial Governor of the Government-General of Korea under the Great Empire of Japan. How dare a mere magazine reporter come to me and speak so freely?" Yet, I saw him differently: "You became Provincial Governor thanks to the times, but what is your reputation? Your clan origin (本) is Pannam (潘南), your surname (姓) is Pak (朴), your generation name (行列) is Yang (陽), but I know about your family background (門閥). Just because a Government-General attendant (給仕) goes to Japan, you customarily (依例) go as far as Ch'up'ungnyŏng Pass (秋風嶺) to give a subservient send-off (屈服儀送), earning the title 'Pak Ch'up'ung' (朴秋風) from the provincial residents (道民). When you go on inspection tours to various counties, you take the travel expenses for yourself and sponge off the county magistrates, making them incur debts of 30 or 40 wŏn at a time, earning resentment from each county magistrate who calls you 'Base Governor' (鄙陋知事) or 'Beggar Governor' (乞人知事). And aren't you an impure man who commits adultery with women (婦女○通)?" So, as he displayed arrogance (驕態), I matched it with my own arrogance and said again, "Of course, I <89> generally know that too, but Your Excellency (脚下 - a sarcastic homophone for 閣下), since you are the head of the province, you should know about matters concerning the entire province. Also, after the recent administrative reorganization, you must have some plans for the province's administrative direction. Please tell me something." He again said he had nothing to say, but after a while, he finally opened his mouth to talk about sericulture (種桑), which he considers his life's work. Mixing Japanese and Korean, he said, "Mulberry trees (나무), fifty stalks (五十本)," and then, like a post horse trudging along after eating barley porridge, he just repeated "...mulberry... (...……...)" a couple of times and stopped. Finally, I requested that he call an guide since I would visit each department, but perhaps feeling it was too impolite to refuse even that, he called a Japanese man named Head of Academic Affairs and introduced him. I visited the various departments with that man and then left. Ah, truly magnificent! How many more days will His Excellency the Governor preserve his position?

The Siguk Taedongdan Selling Beatings
As the saying goes, a mad dog gets beaten wherever it goes. The lecture team of the so-called Siguk Taedongdan (時局大同團) encounters trouble everywhere. This time in Ch'ŏngju, too, while Yi Kyeho and Na Hongsŏk were lecturing inside the Public Common School, the general crowd shouted, "Kill these scoundrels! Drag them out!" causing them to flee in terror to their inn (旅館) without even finishing their speeches. A crowd of over two hundred people then chased them to the inn, beat and slapped the so-called speakers (演士) and the one called the Head of P'och'ŏn'gyo Taejŏn Chinŏngwŏn (普天敎太田眞正院長), spat in their faces, and one young man threw copper coins (銅錢分), saying, "Here, you scoundrels! If your stomachs are empty, take this and eat, and stop doing things that will get you beaten to death!" causing a great commotion for a time. Thanks to the protection of police officers, those individuals fortunately preserved their remaining lives, changed their clothes, and fled secretly in the dark. Money is important, but it must be truly difficult to endure mass beatings just to earn some money. It's hard to tell if it was a lecture promoting Japan-Korea Harmonization (日鮮融和) or a lecture tour selling beatings (매품파리 講演). This too was one of the sights I witnessed during this investigation.

Kim Yusin Shrine, Dilapidated by Wind and Rain
Chinch'ŏn is the birthplace (胎生之地) of the famous Silla general, Kim Yusin. On Kilsangsan Mountain (also known as T'aeryŏngsan, Kim Yusin's placenta burial site) west of the county seat, his memorial shrine (遺祠) stands. In the past, the government office and Confucian scholars specially protected it, even holding memorial rites (享祀) in spring and autumn. Recently, however, there is hardly anyone protecting it, so the shrine building has become dilapidated (頹落) from wind and rain, merely becoming a place of prayer for village women.
(Local women pray for blessings here, like at the Ch'oe Yŏng shrine on Tŏkmulsan Mountain.) His descendants are innumerable (其麗不億), and there is probably no Korean who does not know of his meritorious deeds. However, that his shrine has fallen into such ruin <90> without anyone rebuilding it, is this not a lamentable matter? Recently, his descendant Kim Mansŏp, aiming to rebuild the shrine, cooperated with the county authorities to obtain permission for a loan on the entire Kilsangsan area and is also collecting charitable donations (義損金). I hope that not only his descendants but also the general public will show much sympathy. How can this be dismissed merely as a superstitious project of the old era?

◇ The Unheard Sound of Pounding Rice Cakes
January 29th - by the old calendar, the last day of the twelfth month (섣달금음날). I left Chinch'ŏn heading for Ŭmsŏng. Over a journey of more than eighty ri, I passed through several so-called large villages, but nowhere did I hear the sound of pounding rice cakes (치는 소리). I thought to myself, since it's already the last day of the year, those who would make some New Year's rice cakes probably did so several days ago. But I learned that Ŭmsŏng is originally poor, so even in other years, few houses make rice cakes for the New Year. Last year was particularly bad due to famine, so forget rice cakes; many houses were said to be begging even on New Year's Day. Ah, is this only Ŭmsŏng? This is the life of Koreans today. When will this problem be solved so that people can eat well and play well every holiday?

◇ Spending Three New Years on the Road
While traveling for regional investigation, I have spent the Lunar New Year away from home (客中) three times now. The year before last, I was in Hamyang, Kyŏngnam Province; last year in Hongsŏng; and this year, again, in Ŭmsŏng. However, in Hamyang and Hongsŏng, although away from home, I had some acquaintances, so I talked and drank, and thus didn't feel particularly lonely (孤寂). But this time in Ŭmsŏng, I knew absolutely no one and felt very lonely, truly experiencing the feeling of "alone under the cold lamp of the inn, unable to sleep" (旅館寒燈獨不眠). I realized even more keenly that human beings truly cannot live without companions.

◇ A Pitiful Young Girl
In Ch'ungju, invited by a friend, I went to a restaurant called Yŏngsŏnggwan. There were three or four nominal gisaeng (妓生) entertainers in the house. Among them was a young girl, no more than thirteen or fourteen years old. The girl, seeing me, showed a mix of pleasure and shyness as she greeted me. After a while, she came close and whispered in my ear, "Sir! How did you come here, and when did you arrive?" Startled, I asked, "How do you know me?" The girl whispered again in my ear, "Yes, sir. I was originally a student at ○○ Girls' School in Seoul and attended the ○○○ Youth Association. I saw you often back then." Feeling both pleased and strange, I looked at her for a moment and then asked the <91> girl how she became a gisaeng. The girl whispered again in my ear, "My mother consulted a fortune-teller (四柱장이) about my destiny (四柱), and he said my fate (八字) was to become a widow (寡婦) seven times, but if I became a gisaeng, my later fortune would be good. So she tried to register me as a gisaeng in Seoul, but my father, embarrassed by what others would think, sent me here." Tears welled up in her eyes, and she whispered again, "When you go to Seoul, please don't mention this when you see my teacher, and please don't tell my friends either." She then started singing again, but she couldn't yet sing gisaeng songs, only the school songs (唱歌) she learned, the youth association song (少年會歌), and songs from when she performed in youth musical plays (少年歌劇). Others listened with enjoyment, saying she sang well, but every time I heard her, my heart ached. Ah, pitiful young girl! How could her innocent body, so full of naive purity just yesterday, fall into this devil's den today? It is solely the crime of her ignorant and unenlightened (蒙昧無知) parents and the crime of our superstition-filled society. How many such tragic events truly exist in this world?

◇ Wind and Snow at the Loyal Minister's Shrine
It was January 26th, a day of wind and driving snow. Accompanied by my companions in Ch'ungju, Yi Sŏn'gyu, O Ŏnyŏng, Sŏ Sanggyŏng, and Ku Yŏngsa, I went to Tanwŏl-li to pay respects (拜審) at the Shrine of Loyalty (忠烈祠) for the Loyal Minister Im Kyŏngŏp. This Tanwŏl-li is about ten ri south of Ch'ungju town, on the post road (驛路) leading to Choryŏng Pass. Following the route, we first went to Choryŏng Kado (place name unknown) to see the rock where General Im played as a child. This rock is on a cliff upstream of the Talch'ŏn River, about fifty or sixty paces from the road, with four or five platforms (臺). According to legend, General Im leaped up and down these twelve platforms several times daily. Just hearing this, one can imagine how diligently he trained (鍜錬) his mind and body. After seeing that place, we turned back onto a narrow path to Tanwŏl-li, visited his collateral descendant (傍孫) Im Chikhyŏn, and, guided by someone in his house, paid respects at the Loyal Minister's shrine. At the first entrance to the shrine gate stood the Minister's stele pavilion. In the main shrine, his portrait (遺像) was enshrined. According to the guide, the original portrait in this shrine was unfortunately lost mid-way, and this one is a copy of the portrait enshrined in the main descendant's house. (The Minister had no son, so he adopted Chungjŏ, the son of his younger brother Chunŏp, the magistrate, as his heir.) Next to it stood the memorial gate (旌閭) for his wife, Lady Yi. (Lady Yi also went to Shenyang and died for her principles [殉節].) I had always admired (仰慕) the Minister's loyalty and spirit and deeply regretted (痛恨) his unjust death (寃死). Visiting that place and paying respects before his portrait, feelings of truly immense emotion arose, beyond description. I wished to compose a humble poem as commemoration, but lacking the leisure, I could not write one and just returned.<92> I will merely record the Minister's own sword inscription poem (釰銘) and a poem of sentiment by Hong Chikp'il (pen name Maesan) to introduce to the readers.

Sword Inscription (釰銘)
A three-foot dragon spring [sword], ten thousand scrolls of books,
Imperial Heaven bore me, what was its intent?
A Chancellor east of the mountains, a General west of the mountains,
He is a true man, and I too am a true man.
(Note from the Minister's diary: When I was at Sonongbo Fortress [in Samsu County], I went out to the edge of a large pond. Suddenly, a large snake emerged holding a long object in its mouth and looked at me. I immediately took off the clothes I was wearing and threw them before it. The snake, startled and suspicious, entered the water. A few days later, the weather cleared, and auspicious clouds gathered. I went out again and saw the large snake holding a short object in its mouth. I again took off my clothes and threw them. It placed the object on the clothes and suddenly disappeared. It was a short sword. I composed a regulated verse to inscribe on it. This was when the Minister was twenty-seven years old.)

(Sentiments on Viewing the Portrait of the Loyal Minister Im [Maesan Hong Chikp'il])
The General's shrine lies south of the Talch'ŏn; a traveler comes seeking, emotions long.
Year's end, pines and firs enhance integrity's air; night deep, stars reveal精光 (pure light).
Heroic spirit touches the eye, as if about to speak; utmost shame grips the heart, can it be forgotten?
In the universe, a knowing friend walks alone; alas, I was not beside the Minister then. (Tokpo is the monk Sin Hwal's alias)

-(Ten lines below deleted)-

I will just introduce one masterpiece, the poem "Reminiscing at T'an'gŭmdae" (彈琴臺懷古詩) by Hwang O.
East wind, eastward gaze at T'an'gŭmdae, battlements shrouded in sorrowful clouds, still unopened.
Heaven and earth fruitless, the lord turned his back to the water; rivers and mountains hold regret, the guest holds his cup.
Fishing village evening flute enters Ch'ungju; coastal fort spring beacon comes from Choryŏng.
All day, no sight of brave warrior Sin [Rip]; vast desert sands, white gulls return.

◇ Hwayangdong Put Up for Auction
Few would not know of Hwayangdong in Ch'ŏngch'ŏn-myŏn, Koesan-gun. The original name of this Hwayangdong was Hwangyangdong (黃楊洞, due to abundance of boxwood). After the scholar Song Siyŏl (pen name Uam), famous among recent worshippers of China (支那崇拜者), moved here from Hwajae in Hoedŏk-gun, he took the character 'Hwa' (華) from Chunghwa (中華, China) and 'Yang' (陽) from 'Illyang naebok' (一陽來復, return of Yang energy) to rename it Hwayang (華陽). At that time, Uam loved the landscape of this valley, built the Ogagojae study, taught disciples, obtained the four characters "非禮不動" (Do not act contrary to propriety) in the Ming emperor's calligraphy (御筆), carved them on stone, and stored the original in the Unhan'gak pavilion at Pŏnjangsa Temple (寺及閣其後被火燒盡 - the temple and pavilion later burned down). He also built a room in a spot of fantastic rocks near his study and named it Amseojae (欕書齊). Later, in the Kapsin year of King Sukjong's reign, his top disciple Kwŏn Sangha (pen name Suam), following Uam's last instructions, built a shrine for the Ming emperors Shenzong and Yizong at the foot of Namsan mountain, calling it Mandongmyo (萬東廟, the stele inscription written by Yi Ik, calligraphy by Yu T'ak <93>). He performed rites there in spring and autumn and also participated in rites at the Uam Seowon (academy). This was the greatest undertaking of the so-called advocates of respecting the Zhou (Ming) (尊周主義者), the pretend Ming scholars (假明人學者) of recent times. Later, in the Ŭlch'uk year, the second year of Emperor Yi's (Gojong's) reign (李太皇卽位二年乙丑), the Mandongmyo and Seowon were ordered demolished by the court. Then, in Ŭlhae (482nd year of the Dynasty), their reconstruction was ordered (this is the current Mandongmyo). Until the 11th year of Kwangmu (1907), the state provided funds for the rites, but in the 2nd year of Yung hui (1908), the ritual ceremony (祀典) was finally abolished. This Hwayangdong, facing a tributary of the Hyŏnch'ŏn stream originating from Kyŏngbuk region, features fantastic rocks, sheer cliffs, lush old pines (老松鬱蒼), and clear white stones stretching for about ten ri, forming the so-called Nine Scenic Spots (九景): Cheonbyeok, Unyŏngt'aek, Ch'ipkungam, Kumsat'aek, Ch'ŏmsŏngdae, Nŭng'undae, Waryong'am, Hakchodae, P'agoe (calligraphy by Min Chinwŏn). Also, climbing the cliff (崖攀) south from Ch'ŏmsŏngdae leads to Ch'aeunam Hermitage (綵雲菴), which also has exquisite scenery. In the past, scholars of the Uam faction regarded this place as sacred as Quli (闕里), Confucius's hometown in Lu, and cherished it specially. But times have changed (物換星移), and today, Uam's descendants have mortgaged (抵當) it to a certain Mr. Ch'ŏn (千某) of Map'o, Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul). Lacking the means for repayment (報償), it is currently undergoing auction (競賣). Since it was the Mandongmyo originally built by the Song clan (宋氏), it's not unreasonable for the Song clan to sell it. However, if Uam's spirit exists, he would surely lament from the underworld today, "Alas! In the year Mou-Yue after the Chongzhen era, the Hwayangdong of Great Ming is finally being auctioned!" Lastly, I introduce a poem written previously by some scholar mocking the construction of this Mandongmyo. Although the poem's tone may be vulgar (賤鄙), its principle shows a vast difference (霄壤之判) compared to the Uam faction scholars.

Walking in Hwayangdong, I do not visit Master Song.
Petty Hwayangdong, why does it uniquely belong to Great Ming?

**Summary**

This travelogue from 1925 recounts the author's journey through Chungcheongbuk-do province (Ch'ungbuk). The author describes a demeaning visit with the provincial governor Pak Chungyang, criticizing his arrogance, incompetence, and poor reputation (nicknamed "Lustful Demon Governor"). The narrative contrasts this official corruption with the plight of ordinary people, noting extreme poverty in Ŭmsŏng where New Year's rice cakes are a luxury, and the tragic story of a young former student forced into gisaeng life due to poverty and superstition. The author also reflects on neglected historical sites like Kim Yusin's dilapidated shrine and Im Kyŏngŏp's shrine, expresses disgust at a pro-Japanese group (Siguk Taedongdan) being attacked by crowds, and laments the auctioning of Hwayangdong, a site revered by Neo-Confucian Ming loyalists like Song Siyŏl.

For historians, this article offers a vivid ground-level view of Korean society under Japanese rule in the mid-1920s. It reveals sharp social commentary, critiques of both colonial officials (like Pak Chungyang, a Korean governor) and certain Korean societal elements (superstition, pro-Japanese collaborators, fading traditions like Ming loyalism). The piece highlights economic hardship, the vulnerability of women, popular resistance to collaborators, and complex attitudes towards national history and heritage within the colonial context. The candid criticism of a high-ranking Korean official and the description of popular anger towards collaborators are particularly noteworthy.

朴知事와 問題된 報恩郡俗璃山法住寺

「내가 그래도 前日로말하면 忠淸監司 그럿치 안으면 忠北觀察使 卽今으로도 大日本帝國朝鮮總督府道知事閣下신데 一個雜誌記者가 나에게와서 함부로 무슨말을하누」하는 안이 주저넘은생각이 肛門이서부터 頂首백이지 차뵈인다 그러나 나는 그를 보기를 이러케보앗다「그대는 時代德分에 道知事가 되얏지만은 名色이무엇이냐 本이 潘南이오 姓이 朴이오 行列이 陽이나 門閥의 엇더한 것을 내가알고 總督府給仕만 日本을 가면 秋風嶺지 依例가서 屈服儀送함으로 道民에게 朴秋風이라는 稱號를듯고 各郡出張을 가면 旅費를 타서 自己가먹고 郡守집에가서 대를 부터서한번에 三四十圓빗을지게하야 各郡守에게 鄙陋知事내 乞人知事니하는 稱怨을듯고  婦女○通잘하는 不精한사람이안이냐」고 그래서 그가 驕態를 피우면 나도 驕態를 피우면서 다시말하기를 勿論나도＜89＞ 그런줄은 大槪알지만은 脚下는(閣下와 音은 一般 적어도 道의 長官이닛가 道의 全體에 關한일을 알것이오 今番行政整理以後로 道의 行政方針도 多少의 案이잇슬터이니 말을 좀하야 달나고한즉 그는 亦是아모할말이업다고하더니 한참잇다가 겨우 입을열고그의 平生事業으로아는 種桑에 關한말을하는데 日本말 朝鮮말을 석거서 「나무 고주(五十本)」하고 마치 보리죽먹고 길가는 驛馬모양으로 …………소리만 連해서두어마듸하고만다 나는 最後에 다시 各課訪問을할터이니 案內者一人만불너달나고 請하엿더니 그는 그것지 拒絶하기는 좀 未安한지 學務課長이라는 日本사람을 불너서 紹介한다 나는 그사람과 가티 各課를단녀서 나왓다 아- 참壯하시다 知事大監地位를 몃칠이나 더 保全할지?

風雨에 頹落한 金庾信祠
鎭川은 新羅名將金庾信氏의 胎生之地다 郡西吉祥山(一名胎靈金庾信胎藏地)에 그의 遺祠가잇는데 往時에는 官廳과 儒林에서 特別守護하고 春秋에 享祀지 하더니 近來에는 守護하는사람이 別로업서서 祠宇가 風雨에다 頹落하고 但히 村家婦女의 祈禱場이되엿다
(當地婦女祈福于此如德勿山之崔瑩祠)그의 子孫도 其麗不億이오 朝鮮사람치고는 누구나 그의 功德을 모를사람이업슬 것이다 그러나 그의 祠宇가 이와가티＜90＞ 頹落되되 修築하는 사람이업스니 엇지 애달분일이 안이랴 近者에 그의 遺孫인 金萬燮君이 祠宇를 新築하랴고 郡當局과 協力하야 吉祥山一帶의 貸付許可를 得하고 義損金을 募集中이라하니 그의 孫子은 勿論이어니와 一般의 人士들도 만흔 同情을 하기를 바란다 이것이엇지 舊時代的迷信의 事業이라고만하랴

나는 地方踏査를하노라고 客中에서 舊曆過歲를 세 번재나하엿다 再昨年에는 慶南咸陽에서하고 昨年에는 洪城에서하고 今年은 陰城에서하엿다 그러나 咸陽과 洪城은 비록 客地라도 多少親知가잇서서 이약이도하고 술도먹은 닭에 孤寂한줄을 別로알지못하얏더니 이번陰城은 아주한사람도 아는이가업고 매우 孤寂하야 참으로 旅館寒燈獨不眠 이라는늣김을가젓섯다 人生이란차으로 동모업고는 살수업는 것을 더욱달엇다
◇可憐한 少女
忠州에서 나는 엇던 친구의 招待로 永盛館이라는 料理집을갓섯다 그집에는 名色妓生이 三四名이잇는데 其中에 年齡이 不過 十三四歲되는 少女한아가잇다 其少女는 나를보고반가워도하며 붓그러워도하는 氣色을가지고 인사를하더니 한참잇다가 내겻트로와서 귀에다대고 「先生님! 여긔는 엇재 오시엿스며 언제왓느냐」고뭇는다 나는 작놀나서 네가엇지니를 아느냐 한즉 其少女는 귀에다대고 「네-저는 本來서울 ○○女學校學生으로 ○○○少年會를단녓섯는데 그에 先生님을 만히뵈엿슴니다 라고한다 나는 반갑고도 이상한 생각이나서 한참보다가다시 그＜91＞少女더러엇지아야 妓生이 되엿느냐고물은즉 그 少女는 귀에다대고 「어머니가 엇던 四柱장이에게 저의 四柱를 보닛가 일굽번이나 寡婦가될 八字인데 妓生이되면 後運이조켓다고 해서 서울에 妓生에다 박으랴고하엿더니 아버지가 남이붓그럽다고 이리로 보내서 왓슴니다」하고는 두눈에 눈물이 필돌더니 다시 귀에다 대고 「서울가시거던 우리선생보시고 이말슴을 마르시고 저의동포를보시여도말슴말어주서요」하고 다시 소리를 하는데 아즉지 妓生의 소리는 하지못하고 學校에서 배운 唱歌와 少年會歌 는 少年歌劇할에 하던 唱歌를한다 다른 이들은 그것을 잘한다고 滋味잇게드르나 나는 드를마다 가슴이압헛다 아-可憐한 少女! 前日에 天眞爛漫하던 그 純潔한 몸이 엇지 今日에 이 惡魔의 窟에 질줄알엇스랴 但只蒙昧無知한 그 父母의 罪惡이 오 迷信만흔 우리 社會의 罪惡이다 이 世上에 이런 悲慘한 일이 果然얼마나 잇는가
◇風雲忠愍
바람불고 눈이훗날니던 一月二十六日이엿다 나는 忠州의 동모 李善圭, 吳彦泳, 徐相庚, 具英四氏와 作伴하야 丹月里에가서 林忠愍公景業氏의 忠烈祠를 拜審하게되엿다 이 丹月里는 忠州邑에서 南으로 略十餘里가되는데 鳥嶺으로 通하는 驛路다 路程의 順序로 몬저 鳥嶺假道(地名未詳)에가서 林將軍의 少時에 던바위 求景을하엿다 이 바위는 達川江上流絶壁上에잇는데 路邊에서 略五六十길이나되고 臺가 凡四五가 잇다 傳說에 依하면 林將軍은 每日이 十二臺를 몃번식 超躍上下하엿다한다 그말만드러도 그가 平素에 心身鍜錬을 如何히한 것을 可히알겟다 그곳을보고 우리는 다시 발을돌녀 狹路로 丹月里에가서 그의 傍孫인 林稷鉉氏를 訪問하고 그의 집에잇는 엇던이의 案內로 忠愍公의 廟祠를 拜審하엿다 廟門初入에는 公의 碑閣이 잇고 正廟에는 公의 遺像을 奉安하엿는데 그 案內하는 이의 말을드론즉 本來이 廟祠에잇던 遺像은 不幸히 中年에 遺失하고 그 本孫이 집에 奉安한 遺像을다시 模寫한 것이라한다(公無子以其弟府使俊業子重著爲後)그러고 그엽헤는 公의 夫人李氏의 旌閭가잇다(李氏亦入瀋陽殉節) 나는 平素에 公의 忠義와 氣槪를 仰慕하고 公의 寃死를 痛恨이 思하던바 그곳에가서 公의 遺像을 拜審하니 實로 感慨無量의 懷가 形言할수업게니러낫다 拙한 詩나마한 首를지여 紀念을삼고 자하엿스나 그도 한 餘暇가업서서 짓지못하고 그냥돌아왓＜92＞다 다만 公의 遺詩인 釰銘一首와 梅山洪直弼氏의 感慨詩一首를 記錄하야 讀者에게 紹介한다
釰銘
三尺龍泉萬卷書, 皇天生我意何如. 山東宰相山西將, 彼丈夫兮我丈夫.
(按公之日錄曰我在小農堡(在三水郡)時出遊於大池邊忽有大蛇口含長物出視我我即脫所着衣投之於其前蛇即驚疑凞入於水中數日後天氣明期瑞雲凝結我又出視之則大蛇口含短物我又解衣投之以物置於衣上因忽不見乃短釼也自製一律銘其 云是公二十七能時也
(拜林忠愍公遺像有感(梅山洪直弼)將軍遺廟達川陽客子來尋感慨長, 歲暮松杉增氣節. 夜䦨星斗見精光, 英風觸目如將語. 至恥蔣心可忍忘, 宇宙知音惟獨步. 當時恨不配公傍 (獨步僧申歇別名)

-(以下十行削除)-

다만 彈琴臺懷古詩의 名作인 黃午詩一首를 紹介한다.
東風東望琴臺, 戰壘愁雲欝未關. 天地無功君背水, 江山有恨客含盃. 漁村幕笛忠州入, 海戌春烽鳥嶺來. 盡日不見申壯士, 平沙漠漠白鷗回.
◇競賣에 부튼 華陽洞
槐山郡靑川面의 華陽洞하면 別로모를사람이업슬 것이다 이 華陽洞의 元名은 黃楊洞이니(黃楊이 多함으로)近世支那崇拜者로 有名한 學者宋尤菴時烈氏가 懷德郡華提로부터 此地에 移住한 後中華의 華字와 一陽來復의 陽字를 取하야 華陽으로 改稱하얏다 當時尤菴은 此洞의 山水를 愛하야 五架膏齊를 建하고 後生을 敎授하며 明朝의 御筆「非禮不動」四字를 得하야 石上에 刻하고 原本을 煩章寺雲漢閣에 藏置하며(寺及閣其後被火燒盡) 그 書齊附近巖石奇絶處에 一室을 作하고 欕書齊하 命名하얏다 其後肅宗甲辰에 그의 高弟인 遂菴權尙夏가 尤菴의 遺囑에 依하야 南山麓에 明의 神宗, 毅宗兩皇帝의 廟를 建하고 萬東廟라 稱하야(其碑文李繹撰兪拓＜93＞■書) 春秋에 享祀를하고 尤菴書院에도 參典을 行하얏스니 此가 近世所謂尊周主義者인 假明人學者들의 最大事業이 다 其後李太皇卽位二年乙丑에 朝令으로 萬東廟及書院을 撤毁하얏다가 乙亥(開國四百八十二年)에 다시 重建을 命하고(卽現在萬東廟)光武十一年지 國家에서 享祀費를 支出하다가 隆熙二年에 至하야 遂히 祀典을 廢止하얏다 이 華陽洞은 慶北地方에서 發源하는 玄川의 支流에 臨하야 奇巖絶壁에 老松이 鬱蒼하고 淸州白石이 約十餘里를 相連하야 所謂■天壁, 雲影澤, 泣弓岩, 金沙澤 瞻星臺, 凌雲臺, 臥龍巖, 鶴巢臺, 巴串(閔鎭遠篆書)九景을 成하고 又瞻星臺로부터 崖를 攀하야 南入하면 綵雲菴이 有하니 亦風景이 絶佳하다 往時에 尤菴一派學者들은 此地를 魯의 闕里와 如히 神聖視하야 特別愛護하더니 物換星移한 今日에 尤菴後孫은 此를 京城麻浦千某에게 抵當하고 報償의 道가 無하야 現在競賣中에잇다 元來 宋氏가 建立한 萬東廟이닛가 宋氏가 賣却하야도 無妨한일이다 그러나 尤菴의 靈이 만일잇다하면 今日地下에서도 반드시 「鳴呼崇禎紀元後某年月에 大明之華陽洞遂競賣」라할 것이다 나는 最後에 그前엇던 文士가 이 萬東廟建設한 것을 嘲笑하더라고지은 詩一首를 紹介한다 그 詩가 音으로는 비록 賤鄙하나 主義로는 尤菴派學者에 比하면 霄壤의 判이잇다
