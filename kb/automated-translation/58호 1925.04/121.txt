**Summary**

This short notice corrects the name of a company mentioned in a congratulatory advertisement in the previous issue of the *Kaebyŏk* magazine. The "P'yŏngnam Automobile Company" should have been listed as the "P'yŏngan Automobile Company". This correction highlights the practical function of magazines in managing advertisements and maintaining accuracy for businesses during the colonial period. Historians might find it interesting as evidence of specific commercial enterprises (automobile companies) operating in the P'yŏngan region and the nature of advertising and print media corrections at the time.
