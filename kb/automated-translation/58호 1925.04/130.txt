**Summary**

This article provides a day-by-day account of significant events from February 8 to March 12, 1925, covering Korea, Japan, China, and other parts of the world. It details numerous labor strikes (railway workers, cotton mill workers, printing workers, miners, rice mill workers, tram workers) in Korea, China, and Japan, often involving demands for better wages and conditions, and sometimes leading to violence or suppression. Political developments include the passage of controversial laws like Japan's Peace Preservation Law and Universal Suffrage Bill, international treaty negotiations (US-Germany, Russo-Japanese, Anglo-Italian), disarmament talks, League of Nations activities, governmental changes (Portugal, Turkey, China), and unrest or conflict in various regions (Portugal, Greece-Turkey, China, Persia, Panama, Philippines, Turkey/Kurdistan). Within Korea, events noted include church disputes, student movements, youth conferences, arrests related to independence activities, attacks on Japanese police/officials, natural disasters (fires), and the activities of the Korean Provisional Government in Shanghai.

From the perspective of Korean colonial history, this chronicle is highly revealing. It highlights the intense labor activism among Koreans (both in Korea and Japan), often met with suppression by Japanese authorities or companies. The mention of the Oriental Development Company (東拓) strikes, attacks on Japanese police substations (駐在所), the trial related to the Yi Wan-yong assassination attempt, the arrest of Korean students in Tokyo celebrating the March 1st Movement, the founding (and immediate suppression) of the Federation of Korean Laborers in Tokyo, the activities of the Provisional Government, and the killing of independence fighters (獨立軍) provide direct evidence of the ongoing resistance to Japanese rule and the harsh realities of colonial life. The passage of Japan's Peace Preservation Law (治安維持法), aimed at suppressing dissent, and the decision to subordinate Korean military police directly under Japanese command underscore the tightening grip of colonial control. Historians would find the sheer volume of labor disputes and political actions within such a short timeframe indicative of the social and political ferment in Korea and among Koreans abroad during this period.
