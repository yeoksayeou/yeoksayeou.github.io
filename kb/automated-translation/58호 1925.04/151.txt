Ch'ungbuk's Three Famous Products and Two Great Mines

□=One of the World's Three Great Mineral Springs: Ch'ŏngju Carbonated Water / Annual production of natural cider exceeds 1 million Won, but this too has become the property of the Japanese Nakahara Tetsuomi.
The Napolis mineral spring in England, the Shaoshan mineral spring in the United States, and the natural carbonated spring of Ch'ŏngju are said to be the three great mineral springs of the world. This carbonated spring, traditionally called Ch'ojŏn (椒泉), meaning "Pepper Spring," is located in Ch'ojŏng-ni, Puk-il-myŏn, Ch'ŏngju-gun (about 40-odd *ri* north of Ch'ŏngju-gun, near the Ch'ungju highway; the *Yŏji Sŭngnam* states, "Pepper Water is 39 *ri* east of the provincial capital, its taste is like pepper"). More than 600 *sŏk* (stone measure, approx. 108 kiloliters) of water gush out continuously day and night. King Sejong the Great of the Yi Dynasty specially visited this mineral spring in the spring of the 26th year of his reign (Kapcha year, 1444), and later King Sejo also graced this place with the royal carriage. Since then, its fame spread throughout the country, and every year during the spring, summer, and autumn seasons, men and women from all directions, not minding the journey of several hundred *ri*, gather like clouds to drink this medicinal water. The area around the spring temporarily bustles like a market, with makeshift eateries, fruit stalls, and other entertainment booths standing side-by-side. The Government-General Central Laboratory conducted tests nine times from Meiji 45 (1912) to Taishō 7 (1918), confirming it as a fine spring. Furthermore, in the summer of Taishō 12 (1923), Mr. Yoshiki, Chief Pharmacist of the Government-General Hospital, also personally inspected it and announced its true nature widely. It was clearly proven to be unparalleled as a refreshing beverage, with a high total carbonate content of 8.2050 per liter (*lit* 立瓦) and containing radium emanation (라줌에마나치온) measuring 30 Maché units (마쓰에). Nakahara Tetsuomi, a Japanese businessman and manager of the Keijō Hotel, who has a keen eye for profit, coveted this. He finally acquired it in Taishō 8 (1919) and began manufacturing and selling natural carbonated water, or natural cider, by mixing this spring water with the natural gas erupting nearby. Currently, the annual production reaches around 30,000 cases (4 dozen bottles per case, 凾), and judging by the amount of water gushing out, it is said there is potential to easily produce 1 million cases. <82>

□=Suanbo Hot Spring in Koesan County / Highest Radium Content in the East.
Suanbo Hot Spring, reputed to have the highest radium content in the East, is located in Onch'ŏn-ni, Sangmo-myŏn, Koesan-gun. There is no historical record of this hot spring's origin, but according to local legend, about 350-360 years ago, a village farmer gathered medicinal herbs, and a disabled beggar who stayed overnight during the winter regained the use of his limbs. The villagers found this strange, dug around the area, and discovered the spring. Thereafter, bathers came continuously through all four seasons. However, when a woman accidentally drowned, the villagers considered it an inauspicious place, buried it, and left it untouched for about 40-50 years. Then, an elderly paralyzed man set up a grass hut at the old hot spring site, stayed for over 100 days, and fully recovered from his illness. Everyone was astonished and excavated it again. Its fame eventually spread throughout the world, reaching the present day. This hot spring was originally village property, then became the property of Wŏlha-myŏn, and every year it is put up for bidding, allowing the successful bidder to operate the business. The spring water is colorless, transparent, highly alkaline, with a temperature of 40-50 degrees Celsius. It is particularly effective for skin diseases, women's ailments, syphilis, and rheumatism. The daily output is about 400 *sŏk* (approx. 72 kiloliters), and the average number of bathers per year reaches over 15,000. However, transportation has traditionally been inconvenient, causing much regret among bathers. Recently, the first-class road between Taegu and Kyŏngsŏng opened, increasing daily automobile access, and with more lodging facilities, it has become relatively convenient. Furthermore, when the Ch'ungbuk Line railway extends to Ch'ungju, the number of bathers will undoubtedly surge. Also, nearby are the naturally rugged Choryŏng Pass Gate, the Choryŏng Forest, one of Chosŏn's three major forests, and the Stone Maitreya (Sŏngmirŭk), Ch'ungbuk's largest giant Buddha. Therefore, visitors seeking scenic beauty will also increase throughout the four seasons, and this bathing spot will soon become a major bustling center.

□=The Lifeline of Ch'ungju People: Yellow Tobacco / Cultivation Area 1,500 *chŏngbo*, Annual Production Value Over 1.35 Million Won.
I. History of Yellow Tobacco Cultivation: In the 10th year of Kwangmu (Pyŏngo year, 1906), the Korean Government's Finance Advisory Department, after investigating Chosŏn's soil quality, discovered that its climate closely resembled that of the main yellow tobacco producing regions in North America, such as Virginia and North Carolina. Deeming it suitable <83> for yellow tobacco cultivation, they established a nursery in Yamato-chō (then Naksŏn-bang) in Kyŏngsŏng and distributed seedlings to cultivators for transplanting. This marked the beginning of yellow tobacco cultivation. The following year (Chŏngmi, 1907), a branch office was set up in Kich'ang, Sŏngch'ŏn-gun, P'yŏngnam Province, and the Yellow Oronoco (엘로오로노코) variety was test-planted. Seeds were also distributed to nearby cultivators, but at the time, most cultivators were inexperienced in farming methods and generally did not achieve good results. However, the results from the directly managed test cultivation were quite favorable. Therefore, the following year (Musin, 1908), further steps were taken in test cultivation. Unexpectedly, they were attacked by righteous armies (義兵, *ŭibyŏng*) of the time; the office was burned down, and staff members were harmed, becoming the first victims of yellow tobacco cultivation. Due to this incident, activities were inevitably halted. In the 3rd year of Yung-hŭi (Kiyu, 1909), a tobacco experimental station was established again in Taegu, Kyŏngbuk Province, testing yellow tobacco along with various other types. In the 4th year (Kyŏngsul, 1910), another experimental station was added in Taejŏn, Ch'ungnam Province. Having confirmed good results, in June of Meiji 44 (1911), to select a production area for yellow tobacco, Yangju in Kyŏnggi Province, Haeju and Chaeryŏng in Hwanghae Province, Kimhwa, Ch'ŏrwŏn, and P'yŏnggang in Kangwŏn Province, and Ch'ungju in Ch'ungbuk were designated as candidate sites. After detailed investigations regarding cultivated land area, number of farm households, geology, soil properties, topography, location, climate, labor costs, and fertilizer supply, it was determined that Ch'ungju-gun shared the same latitude as the original tobacco production areas of Virginia (븨아지니아) in North America. Furthermore, its climate had traditionally caused no major harm to crops, transportation was convenient, there was a large plain of over 2,000 *chŏngbo*, the topography was extremely suitable for drainage, and importantly, it did not contain iron, the biggest impediment to tobacco cultivation. Thus, confirming its suitability for yellow tobacco cultivation in all aspects, a branch office of the Treasury Department's Tax Bureau was established in the county in Meiji 45 (1912). Since then, cultivation began, soil was analyzed, and seeds of varieties from the original American production areas such as Yellow Oronoco (엘로오로노코), Bright Yellow (라이트엘로), Hester (헤스타), Conqueror? (공쿠엘노), Kentucky Yellow? (겐닷기엘로), and six others were selected. First, model cultivation was demonstrated for private farmers. The following year, direct management cultivation aimed at seed collection and experimental farming was conducted, while materials for cultivation were loaned to private farmers, encouraging private cultivation in various ways. Consequently, the number of people engaged in this work increased year by year, making Ch'ungju's yellow tobacco famous throughout the world, and this tobacco became the livelihood of Ch'ungju. (The Cultivation Association was established in Taishō 2 [1913]).
II. Outline of Cultivation Method: There are two types of tobacco seedbeds: raised beds (揚床) and ground beds (地床). Those using raised beds have an earlier harvest time, while those using ground beds are slower, extending until the end of September. Seeds are sown in the seedbeds around April 10th, and the seedlings are transplanted to the main field by June 25th, planting about 20 plants per *tanbo*. Fertilizer is applied twice, before and after planting. For one *tanbo*, the fertilizer used consists of 50 *kwan* of Shanghai oil cake (上海油粕), 10 *kwan* of cottonseed cake (綿實粕), 5 *kwan* of superphosphate (過燐酸石炭 - likely superphosphate of lime), 2 *kwan* of potassium sulfate (流酸加里) (48%), and 250 *kwan* of compost/manure (堰肥). After budding and when one or two flowers <84> appear and there are 13-14 leaves, the flower buds are removed to promote leaf fullness. Harvesting begins approximately 70-80 days after transplanting. Harvesting typically starts from the lower leaves and proceeds upwards, finishing in five or six rounds. The harvested leaves are strung on ropes and hung in a drying room (dimensions: 2 *kan* wide, 3 *kan* long, 3 *kan* high - approx. 3.6m x 5.4m x 5.4m) for flue-curing. The room temperature is gradually raised from an initial 95 degrees (Fahrenheit likely, ~35°C) to 160 degrees (~71°C) to fix the leaf color as yellow. Drying takes 103 to 120-130 hours, and one room typically holds 300-400 *kwan* (1125-1500 kg) of fresh leaves. When handling the dried leaves, appropriate moisture (溫氣) is added to prevent damage during handling. They are then taken down, stored for about three weeks, sorted according to leaf size and quality, packed into standard 10-*kwan* bales, and then undergo inspection by the Monopoly Bureau based on grade (payment is made according to the grade).
III. Use: Cut tobacco for rolling papers (兩切紙) and pipes (節煙草).
IV. Markets: Kyŏngsŏng, Taegu, P'yŏngyang, and overseas.
V. Cultivation Area: Ch'ungju vicinity, 8 *myŏn* in Koesan, 6 *myŏn* in Eumsŏng, 4 *myŏn* in Chech'ŏn; total area: 1,500 *chŏngbo*.
The progress of this business is shown in the table below:

□=Two Great Inexhaustible Black Lead (Graphite) Mines / Estimated Reserves Over 1 Million Tons, Owners Are Also Japanese.
1. Wŏlmyŏng Mine (月明鑛山): This mine is located in Myŏngch'i-ri (Wŏlmyŏng-dong), Ch'ŏngsan-myŏn, Okch'ŏn-gun. Situated 25 *ri* east of Ch'ŏngsan, it covers half of Ip'eum-san near the Kyŏngsang Pukto border, encompassing an area of 280,000 *p'yŏng* (approx. 92.6 hectares). It is a large black lead (graphite) mine with estimated reserves of 1 million tons (Government-General survey). The ore deposit (鑛床) is embedded in gneiss, striking 60 degrees, dipping 60 to 70 degrees. There are three main ore veins, each extending 3,000 *ch'ŏk* (feet/shaku, approx. 909m), with widths ranging from 6 to 30 *ch'ŏk* (approx. 1.8m to 9m). The quality averages 83% fixed carbon, ranging from 80% to 87%. Around Meiji 40 (1907), this mine was operated by the Pusan Korean Black Lead Company (釜山韓國黑鉛商會). Later, it was taken over by Ishikawa Kyūzō, a Japanese resident in Kyŏngsŏng, and subsequently came under the management of the current owner, Yamano Shūichi. Currently, a mine-dedicated road has been built covering the 8 *chŏng* (approx. 870m) between Ch'ŏngsan and Ch'ŏngch'ŏn River, and the 1.5 *ri* (approx. 600m) distance between the river and the mine. Equipped with over 50 oxcarts and handcarts and several ferries, it transports over 500 tons per month. This, along with the Sangung graphite (山宮黑鉛) shipped out from Yŏngdong Station, makes it one of the foremost black lead mines in all of Chosŏn. (Current mine inventory approx. 5,000 tons, it is said).

2. Sogung Black Lead Mine (小宮黑煙鑛): The sight of large piles resembling a great lead mountain, stacked daily in the plaza of Hwanggan Station on the Kyŏngbu Line, is black lead transported from the Sogung Mine. This mine is located in Sipang-ni, Mosŏ-myŏn, Sangju-gun, Kyŏngbuk, on P'arŭm-san, covering a vast mining area of 1 million *p'yŏng* (approx. 330 hectares). Komiya Manjirō, a Japanese resident of Pusan, began excavating here <86> since the 9th year of Kwangmu (1905). At that time, the crude ore was exported as is to Germany via Nagasaki. Currently, it is mainly exported to the Kyūshū region and America via Tōkyō. The quality is roughly the same as the Wŏlmyŏng Mine, and the reserves are said to be 1.5 million tons (Government-General survey). A light railway (經便鐵道) has been laid over the 13 miles between Hwanggan Station and the mine site, transporting 26 tons per day. Although the scale of excavation has been somewhat reduced compared to before, it still employs 120-130 Korean miners (朝鮮鑛夫) and over 10 Japanese miners (日本人鑛夫) daily. A substantial office is maintained in front of Hwanggan Station to handle administrative affairs. The total investment since the beginning of operations amounts to about 200,000 Won, with circulating capital reaching 400,000 Won. In Taishō 9 (1920), shipments to Pusan reached 6,800 tons, and in Taishō 10 (1921), 5,700 tons. Even now, this mine accounts for 70% of the total revenue of Hwanggan Station. Mentioning such things only hurts the hearts of Koreans and serves no necessary purpose, but let's keep it in mind anyway.

Leaving Behind the Eternal Righteous Soul: Im Ch'ungmin Kong (林忠愍公)
<87>

**Summary**

This 1925 article from *Kaebyŏk* magazine highlights three major products and two significant mines in Ch'ungch'ŏngbuk-do (Ch'ungbuk) province during the Japanese colonial period. It details the Ch'ŏngju Carbonated Spring, famous as one of the world's best and commercially exploited by a Japanese hotelier; the Suanbo Hot Spring, known for its high radium content and growing popularity due to improved transport; and the extensive cultivation of American yellow tobacco centered in Ch'ungju, vital to the local economy but initiated and controlled by the colonial administration and its Monopoly Bureau. The article also describes two major graphite mines, Wŏlmyŏng and Sogung, detailing their large estimated reserves, production scale, and export activities, explicitly noting that both are owned and operated by Japanese individuals, having taken over from previous Korean or joint ventures.

From a colonial history perspective, the article is revealing. It showcases the identification and exploitation of Korean natural resources (mineral springs, fertile land for cash crops, graphite deposits) primarily by Japanese capitalists and the colonial state apparatus (Government-General labs, bureaus, experimental stations). While presenting these as "famous products" of Ch'ungbuk, the text explicitly points out Japanese ownership of the most lucrative ventures (the spring, the mines) and the colonial control over tobacco cultivation. The final sentence regarding the Sogung mine – "Mentioning such things only hurts the hearts of Koreans... but let's keep it in mind anyway" – directly voices the underlying resentment and awareness of economic exploitation under colonial rule. Historians might find the detailed descriptions of resource extraction, the role of Japanese individuals and the colonial government, the specific production figures, and the expressed sentiment of Korean grievance particularly valuable.

忠北의 三大名物과 二大鑛山
□=世界三大靈泉의 一인 淸州炭酸/天然사이다의 年産額이 一百萬圓以上인데 이것도 日本人中原鐵臣의 所有가 되얏다
英國의 나포리스 鑛泉과 米國의 시야스온 鑛泉과 淸州의 天然炭酸泉은 世界의 三大靈泉이라한다 이 炭鑛泉은 自來椒泉이라 稱하던 名이니 淸州郡北一面椒井里(在淸州郡北四十餘里忠州街道附近輿地勝覽에 椒水在州東三十九里其味如椒云)에잇서서 一晝夜에 六百石以上의 多量水가 滖滖이 湧出한다 李朝의 世宗大王은 卽位二十六年甲子春에 特히 此靈泉에 幸行하얏고 其後世祖大王도 한 此地에 龍駕를 御하얏다 伊來名聲이 全國에 喧傳되야 每年春夏及秋季의 節에 四方의 男女가 幾百里의 途를 不遠하고 蝟集하야 此藥水를 飮用하매 泉水의 周圍는 一時市場과가티 繁盛하야 假設의 飮食店, 果物店其他興行室이 櫛比하게된다 總督府中央試驗所에서는 明治四十五年以來로 大正七年지 凡九回를 試驗하야 其良泉인 것을 發表하고 大正十二年夏季에 總督府醫院藥劑長吉木君도 親檢하고 其眞相을 各方面에 發表하얏는데 一立瓦中總炭鑛量이 八,二○五○의 多額에 達하는 것과 三十「마쓰에」를 起하는 「라줌에마나치온」을 含有한 것은 淸凉飮料로 至純無二한 것을 明白히 證明한다 取利에 눈밝은 京城호텔 經營者日本人中原鐵臣은 이것을 垂涎하다가 大正八年에 비로소 買收하야 此靈泉과 其附近에 嘖出하는 天然瓦斯를 混和하야 天然炭鑛水天然사이다를 製造하야 世上에 販賣하는데 目下年産額이 一凾四打入三萬凾內外에 達하고 其湧出量으로 推見하면 尙히 一百萬凾을 無廣製造할 可能性이잇다한다＜82＞
□=槐山郡水安堡溫泉/라줌 含有量이 多하기는 東洋第一이다
라줌 含有量이 多하기로 東洋의 第一이라 稱하는 水安堡溫泉은 槐山郡上芼面溫泉里에잇다 이 溫泉의 由來는 史徵의 可考할 者가 無하나 俗說에 依하면 距金約三百五六十年間에 村農이 藥草를 其他에 하얏더니 積置하얏더니 冬季에 不具한 乞人이 留宿하다가 手足의 自由를 得함으로 洞人이 怪異이 思하고 그 附近을 堀䥣의하야 此를 發見하얏다한다 其後四時로 浴客이 不絶하더니 偶然히 一女子가 溺死하매 洞人은 此를 凶地라하야 埋藏하고 約四五十年間을 不問에 附하다가 一老人躄者가 溫泉舊地에 草幕을 設하고 來留한지 百餘日에 其病이 全快함을보고 一般이 驚異하야 다시 發掘하니 其名聲이 遂히 世에 傳播되야 今日에지 至하얏다 此溫泉은 元來里有가되얏다가 月下面有가되야 每年此를 入札하야 落札者로 營業을하게한다 泉質은 無色透明하고알칼늬性이 多하며 溫度는 四○-五○度요 皮膚病, 婦人病, 梅毒, 루마지스에 特效가잇고 一日에 湧出量은 四百石假量이요 一年浴客은 平均約一萬五千餘人에 達한다 그러나 自來交通이 不便하야 浴客의 遺憾이 多하더니 近間大邱京城間一等道路가 開通되야 每日自動車의 便이 多하고 且旅館의 設備가 多하야 比較的便利한바 伊後忠北線鐵道가 忠州지 開通되면 浴客이 一層激增한 것은 勿論이오 又其附近에 天設險地鳥嶺關門, 朝鮮三大森林인 鳥嶺森林과 忠北의 第一巨佛인 石彌勒이 有한즉 四時探賞의 客이 한 多하야 未久에 此浴地는 一大繁華之地가될것이다
□=忠州人의 生命인 黃色煙草/耕作地面積一千五百町步年産額一百三十五萬餘圓
一, 黃色種煙草耕作의 沿革 光武十年丙午에 韓國政府財政顧問部에서는 朝鮮의 土質을 調査한 結果其風土가 黃色煙草가 主産地인 北米의 「뵈아지니아」「北칼로라이나」等各州와 酷似한 것을 發見하고 黃煙草栽培에 適用＜83＞함으로 語하야 京城大和町(當時樂善坊)에 苗圃를 設하고 苗를 耕作者에게 分給하게 移種을 拭하니 此가 卽黃煙栽培의 嚆矢엿다 其翌年丁未에 平南成川郡岐倉에 出張所를 設하고 「엘로오로노코」種을 試種하며 尙히 附近耕作者에게 種子를 分配하야 耕作을하게하얏스나 當時一般의 耕作者는 耕作의 方法이 未熟함으로 大槪良好한 成績을 見치못하얏다 그러나 直營試作의 成績은 頗히 良好함으로 其翌年戊申에 更히 試作의 步를 進하얏더니 不意에 當時義兵의 襲擊을 被하야 事務所가 燒失되고 所員이 被害하야 黃烟의 第一回犧牲者가되얏다 事가 此에 至하매 不得已中止하고 隆熙三年己酉여 更히 慶北大邱에 烟草試作場을 設하야 各種烟草와 共히 黃烟을 試作하고 同四年庚戌에 試作場을 忠南太田에 增設하야 其成績이 良好한 것을 確認한바 明治四十四年六月에 遂이 黃烟의 産地를 選擇하기 爲하야 京畿道의 楊州, 黃海道의 海州載寧, 江原道金花, 鐵原, 平康及忠北의 忠州를 預定地로 定하고 耕地面積, 農家戶數地質, 土性, 地勢, 位置, 氣衆, 勞銀, 肥料의 供給에 關한 調査를 精密이한 結果 忠州郡은 北米「븨아지니아」州의 烟草原産地와 緯度가 同一하고 氣象을 從來農作物에 大害를 及하는 事가 無하며 兼하야 交通이 便利하고 且二千餘町步의 一大平野가 有하며 地形은 排水에 極便할外라 烟草耕作에 最大禁涊物인 鐵質을 含有치아니하야 各方面이 黃烟栽培에 最適宜한 것을 確知하고 明治四十五年에 同郡에 度支部司稅局出張所를 設置한 後爾來耕作에 着手하야 土壤을 分析하며 種子는 米國原産地의 「엘로오로노코」, 「라이트엘로」, 「헤스타」, 「공쿠엘노」, 「겐닷기엘로」外六種을 選하야 先히 民間耕作에 模範을 試하고 次年度에는 種子의 採取及試驗耕作을 目的하는 直營耕作으로 行하며 民間에는 耕作用物資를 貸付하야 各方으로 民間耕作을 獎勵함으로 此에 從業하는 者逐年增加하야 忠州에 黃色烟草가 遂히 世에 著名하고 忠州에 此烟草로 生業을 하게되얏다(耕作組合은 大正二年設立됨)
二, 耕作方法의 槪要, 烟草의 苗床은 揚床地床二種이 有하니 揚床에 依한 者는 收穫期가 早速하고 地床에 依한 者는 遲緩하야 九月末지 至한다 種子는 四月十日頃지 苗床에 播種하고 其苗는 六月二十五日지 本圃에 移植하는데 一反步에 約二十本內外를 植付하며 植付前後에 二回의 肥料를 施한다 肥料는 一反步에 對하야 上海油粕五十貫, 綿實粕十貫, 過燐酸石炭五貫, 流酸加里二貫匆(四八%)堰肥二五○貫, 匆를 用하고 出蕾後開花一二輪＜84＞着葉十三四枚될 時를 標準하야 花蕾를 摘去하고 葉의 充實를 計하며 移植後約七八十日後에 收穫着手한다 收穫은 下葉으로부터 順次로 上葉에 及하야 五六回에 終了함이 普通이요 收穫한 葉은 繩에 挾하야 乾燥室(幅二間, 長三間, 高三間)에 掛하고 火力乾燥를 行하나니 室內溫度는 最初九十五度로부터 順次百六十度에 至케하야 葉色을 黃色으로 固定케한다 乾燥時間은 百三間乃至百二三十時間은 要하고 一室收容生葉量普通三四百貫이며 乾燥할에는 取扱할 際에 破損되지아니하도록 適度의 溫氣를 與하고 此를 取下하야 約三週間貯藏하얏다가 葉의 大나 品位의 善惡에 作하야 相當히 區分調理하고 十貫勿를 標準하야 包藏한 後機에 依하야 專賣局에 檢査를 受한다(等에 依하야 代金을 支出함)
三, 用途兩切紙節煙草
四, 需用地 京城, 大邱, 平壤及海外
五, 耕作區域, 忠州一圓, 槐山八面, 陰城六面, 堤川 四面計 面積計一五○○町步
尙히 其業의 經過를 示하면 左表와 如하다

□=無盡藏의 二大黑煙鑛/推定鑛量一百萬噸以上, 主人公은 亦是다 日本人
一月明鑛山 이 鑛山을 沃川郡靑山面明峙里(月明洞)에 잇스니 靑山에 東二十五里, 慶尙北道界入音山의 半面을 鑛區로하야 面積二十八萬坪의 推定鑛量一百萬噸에 達하는 大黑煙鑛이다(總督府調査) 鑛床은 片麻巖系로 胚胎한 鑛府인데 走向六十度, 傾斜六十度乃至七十度, 主要鑛脈三層其延長各三千尺, 幅六尺乃至三十尺에 達하고 品質은 百分中固定炭素八十퍼선트乃至八十七에 達하야 平均八十三퍼선트라한다 此鑛은 明治四十年頃에 釜山韓國黑鉛商會에서 經營하다가 其後에 京城에 在한 日本人石川久三이 引受하고 다시 現鑛主山野秀一의 經營에 歸하얏다 現在靑山靑川江間八丁, 江과 鑛山間一里半距離에 鑛山專用道路를 開鑿하고 牛車及荷車五十餘臺와 數隻의 渡船을 設備하야 一個月五百餘噸을運搬하야 永同驛에 搬出되는 山宮黑鉛과 相幷하야 全鮮有數희 黑煙鑛이다(現在鑛量約五千噸云)
小宮黑煙鑛 京釜線黃■驛廣場에 每日積置되야 一見에 大鉛山과가튼 것은 小宮鑛山에서 搬出한 鉛黑이다. 이 鑛山은 慶北尙州郡牟西面十方里八音山의 東一百萬坪되는 一大鑛區다 釜山의 日本人小宮萬次郞이 光武九年＜86＞以來로 採掘하야 當時에는 粗鑛그대로 長崎를 經由하야 獨逸에 輸出하더니 目下는 主로 東京을 經由하야 九州方面及米洲에 輸出한다 品質은 月明鑛과 略相同하고 鑛量은 百五十萬噸이라한다(總督府調査)黃澗驛으로부터 鑛山地지 十三哩間에 經便鐵道를 敷設하고 一日에 二十六噸을 搬出하는데 現에는 前에 比하야 多少採掘의 規模를 縮少하야스나 尙히 一日에 朝鮮鑛夫百二三十人日本人鑛夫十餘人으로 使用하고 黃澗驛前에는 相當한 事務所를 置하야 事務를 執行한다 開業以來今日지 投資額은 約二十萬圓, 融通資金은 四十萬圓에 至하고 大正九年에는 釜山送貨가 六千八百噸, 同十年에는 五千七百噸, 現今에도 黃澗驛總收入의 七割은 此鑛山이 占하얏다 이러한 것을 말하면 朝鮮人은 속만 傷할이오 何等必要가업지마는 大槪알어두잔말이다
千古義魄을 遺停한 林忠愍公
