Establishment of Branch/Sub-offices / -We humbly convey this intention to interested parties within and outside the country-

Although this is not something we can simply state on paper, we currently have particular thoughts and have decided to establish branch/sub-office organizations within the country (國內) in each prefecture (府) and county (郡), and outside the country (國外) in various locations where our compatriots (同胞) live collectively, by July of this year (今年 七月). We dare to express this intention openly (路骨). Therefore, those who truly possess thoughts regarding this matter, please inquire with our company's Business Bureau (本社 營業局), noting together (俱記) a summary of your personal experience (經歷槪要, including educational background 學歷) and the circumstances of the new discourse community (新論界 形便) in that region (for example 例하면, the current development status 發展現況 of other newspapers or magazines).

Kaebyŏk Company Business Bureau (開闢社 營業局) <74>

**Summary**

This is an announcement from the Kaebyŏk Company's Business Bureau, published in the April 1925 issue of Kaebyŏk magazine. The company declares its plan to establish branch offices across Korea (in every prefecture and county) and internationally in areas with significant Korean populations by July 1925. They are soliciting inquiries from interested individuals, asking them to provide their resumes and information on the local media landscape (other newspapers/magazines). From a historical perspective, this article highlights Kaebyŏk's ambition to expand its network and influence significantly, both domestically and among the Korean diaspora, during the Japanese colonial period. It reflects an effort to build a nationwide and potentially transnational Korean intellectual and communication network, likely for nationalist or cultural purposes, under the constraints of colonial rule. Historians might find the call for information about the "new discourse community" (新論界) and competing publications particularly interesting for understanding media networks and intellectual life at the time.
