Closing Remarks

◇ Throwing down the pen and looking out the window, the budding willow branches, receiving the spring breeze, sway gracefully. It is unmistakably spring. Now that the editing of the April issue is finished, why mention spring again! One cannot help but feel the flowing passage of time once more.

◇ It is April. Among the yearly events, it is the biggest event: the beginning of the school term. It is a busy time for educators and students alike. It is a time when both educators and students are full of new plans and new hopes. Taking advantage of this most meaningful season of the year, we have edited this issue centering especially on the academic world. We hope that both educators and students will read it together.

◇ Mr. Chu Chong-gŏn's (朱鍾建) "Theory of Modern Education," Mr. Kim Ki-jŏn's (金起田) "Theory of the Educator," and Mr. Kim Ki-jin's (金基鎭) "Theory of the Middle School Student" are said to be definitely worth reading. Kwan Sang-ja's (觀相者) "Physiognomy of Figures in the Kyŏngsŏng Education World and Students" will undoubtedly become a topic of much gossip, and we know Pak Tori's (朴돌이) "Graduation Ceremony Tour" will not end merely as simple amusement.

◇ Just as the comparison of Chosŏn before and after the March First Movement in the March issue pleased the readers, we believe the overview of the academic world in the April issue will certainly please the readers. The Chungbuk (忠北) Exploration Report will also undoubtedly be a great reference, and anyway, we hope that even just one more copy of this book finds its way into the hands of educators and students.

◇ Due to the simultaneous publication of the "Overview of the Academic World" and the "Chungbuk Exploration Report," we could not include many other articles. Starting with Mr. Tonggok's (東谷) treatise on China, even continuations could not be included. In the literary section, it is especially regrettable that many fine manuscripts (玉稿) have been left out.

◇ In Japan (日本), bad laws are passed; in China (中國), Sun Mun (孫文) has died; and in Chosŏn (朝鮮), the second general meetings of both the Youth and the Labor-Farmer General Alliances are about to be held. With joy and sorrow intertwined, it is hard to find one's bearings, but we have provided brief discussions for reference, so please read these as well.

◇ As announced, the Hwanghae (黃海) exploration has begun. On March 16th, Mr. Ch'a Sang-hu (車相後) departed first towards the Haeju (海州) area. Mr. Pak Tal-sŏng (朴達成) will also depart soon after. We ask for much support from the personages of Hwanghae Province and, first of all, wish Mr. Ch'a good health. <79>

**Summary**

This editorial postscript for the April 1925 issue of *Kaebyŏk* reflects on the arrival of spring and the start of the new school year. It highlights the issue's focus on education, mentioning specific articles on modern education, educators, students, and a potentially controversial physiognomy piece on the Kyŏngsŏng education scene. The editors express satisfaction with reader response to the previous issue and hope the current one, including a Chungbuk travelogue, will be well-received, especially by educators and students. They apologize for omitting other articles due to space constraints and briefly comment on significant contemporary events: repressive laws in Japan, the death of Sun Yat-sen in China, and upcoming meetings of youth and labor-farmer alliances in Korea. The piece concludes by announcing the start of a planned survey of Hwanghae Province. For historians, this text offers insights into the editorial priorities and intellectual concerns of a major Korean nationalist magazine during the colonial period, reflecting engagement with education, social commentary, contemporary political events across East Asia, and regional exploration projects within Korea. The mention of specific articles and authors provides a glimpse into the intellectual discourse of the time.
