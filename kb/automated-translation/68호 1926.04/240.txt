Having finished editing the April issue, let me tell you, we really went through a lot with the March issue. As they say, "trouble brews where expected" (lit. "a tiger appears in a fearsome valley"), and somehow the March issue felt ominous, and sure enough, on February 24th, the March issue was confiscated. "If it's confiscated, it's confiscated. What can we do about something that happens regularly? We'll just have to issue an extra edition (號外)." So, we set about preparing the extra edition, but what the heck! The extra edition was also blocked. I was so angry, but what could be done? As we waited day by day, hoping for a resolution, all sorts of rumors circulated about bans (禁), suspensions (停), and investigations (司). Still, thinking things couldn't really be that way, we just waited for the authorities' favorable interpretation (善解), and finally, on March 10th, we received notification that the extra edition could be published. That's why the March issue was so delayed.

Whether it's the fault of the authorities or the editors, it's said that such frequent confiscations are unprecedented except for *Kaebyŏk* (開闢) of Korea (朝鮮). Let's consider it both parties' fault. From the April issue onwards, we are striving hard to send the main issue (本號) to the readers as scheduled. We hope the authorities will show favorable consideration (善諒) and that the readers will also understand favorably (善解).

With competitions noisily arising in the literary world over "pro" [proletarian] and "bour" [bourgeois], it is truly difficult to obtain manuscripts in this situation where writers are scarce anyway. Moreover, among the few writers we have, some have fled overseas, some have entered prison, and some are groaning with illness – it's truly a regrettable situation. We eagerly await the emergence in droves (簇出) of new writers (新進文士). Please come forth in great numbers!

Although we don't mean it as spring revelry (新春行樂), naturally, in April, one's mind becomes restless. Therefore, we have included a lot of miscellaneous items (잡동산이). When one has no appetite, bibimbap is just the thing, so we've gathered together all sorts of things to be angry about and laugh about. We hope for much discussion and criticism, good or bad (善惡間 多言多評).

The continuation of the "Historical Study of the Korean Social Movement" (朝鮮社會運動의 史的 고찰) has been suspended for now due to various circumstances. <46>

**Summary**

This editor's postscript details the confiscation of the previous month's (March 1926) issue of *Kaebyŏk* magazine by the authorities and the subsequent delay caused by difficulties in even publishing an extra edition. The editor laments the frequent censorship faced by the magazine, expresses the hardship of securing manuscripts due to writers being imprisoned, ill, or having fled abroad, mentions the contemporary literary debates ("pro" vs. "bour"), and explains the inclusion of diverse content in the current (April) issue. It also notes the temporary suspension of a series on the history of the Korean social movement. For historians, this piece offers a direct glimpse into the severe censorship faced by Korean publications under Japanese rule, highlighting the constant pressure and disruption experienced by publishers and intellectuals. It also reflects the precarious situation of writers and the ideological divisions (proletarian vs. bourgeois literature) emerging in the Korean literary scene during the 1920s.

餘言
4월호를 편집해 노코보니 말이지 지난 3월호야말로 여간 혼나지 안핫다. 무서운 골에 범난다고 엇전지 3월호는 좀 무엇무엇하더니 안이나 다를가 2월 24일로써 3월호가 압수되겟지. 「압수면 압수겟지. 例로 당하는 일을 엇저나. 號外나 발행할 밧게.」하고 곳 號外 발행에 착수를 하랴닛가 웬 걸. 號外도 말나겟지. 화가 엇지도 나든지 그럼 할 수 잇나. 해결되기만 기다리며 그날 그날을 지내노라닛가 禁이니 停이니 司니 하고 별별 소리가 만히 다니겟지. 그래도 그럴 수야 잇슬가 하고 당국의 善解만 기다렷더니 마츰 3월 10일에 와서야 號外 발행의 報가 잇섯다. 그래서 3월호가 그러케 느졋섯다.

당국의 잘못인지 편집자들의 잘못인지 여하간 압수의 도가 그러케 자즌 것은 朝鮮의 開闢 외에는 그 유례가 업다 한다. 피차간 다 잘못으로 치고 4월호부터는 本號대로 독자에게 보내랴고 무척 고심을 한다. 당국도 善諒하려니와 독자도 善解하기를 바란다.

「프로」니 「부르」니 하고 문단에 경쟁이 왁자자 니러나더니 가지로 집필자가 부족한 이 판국에 원고 엇기가 실로 곤란하다. 더군다나 몃 명 안되는 그 사람 중에서 혹은 해외로 달어나고 혹은 감옥에 드러가고 혹은 병으로 신음하고 참말 섭섭한 일이다. 新進文士의 簇出을 고대한다. 만히 나와다고-.

新春行樂을 뜻함은 안이지만 자연히 4월은 마음이 싱숭생숭 해진다. 그래서 잡동산이를 만히 실엇다. 입맛 업는데는 비빔밥이 제걱으로 이것저것 怒할 것 웃을 것을 다- 끄려대엿다. 善惡間 多言多評을 바란다.
朝鮮社會運動의 史的 고찰의 계속은 여러 가지 사정에서 아즉 중지하기로 햇다.＜46＞
