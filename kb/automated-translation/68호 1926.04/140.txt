Ireland's Future Worth Watching!
Mr. de Valera (데·바레라), renowned as the President of the Irish Republic, has recently resigned from his position as the head of the Sinn Féin (싱·펜) Party. The reason is said to be as follows: In Ireland, there is one faction, the current Irish Free State government, which upholds constitutionalism, and another faction, the Sinn Féin Party, which opposes it and upholds republicanism. This time, Mr. de Valera, considering the recent political situation, submitted a motion asking, "If the Irish Free State deputies abolish only the oath of allegiance to the British Emperor, how about we, the Sinn Féin members who uphold republicanism, also acknowledge becoming deputies in the Free State Parliament?" However, this motion was rejected by the party members. What, then, will be Ireland's future?

The Reddening of Japanese Politicians?
According to the explanation of Mr. Makino Ryōzō (牧野良三), a Diet member of Japan's (日本) opposition party, the Seiyūkai (政友會), the issue brought up during this Diet session by Mr. Nakano Seigō (中野正剛), the propaganda chief of the ruling party Kenseikai (憲政會), concerning the alleged misuse of army secret funds by Generals Tanaka (田中) and Yamanashi (山梨), was supposedly done after receiving propaganda funds from Red Russia (赤露). The aim was to cast national suspicion upon the Japanese army, employing the same methods the Russian Communist Party (露國共産黨) used years ago to cause the collapse of the state organization of the former Russian Empire (舊露西亞帝國). Furthermore, it was stated that attention should be paid to the fact that there are as many as 7,500 current Japanese individuals who have joined the Third International Communist Party (第三 國際共産黨), and it goes without saying what kind of people are among them. In any case, these are the actions and words of the elected representatives who currently sway Japan's political situation, so it is something worth listening to for now.

University and Elementary School Are Like This
Kyŏngsŏng University (京城大學), which seems to vex the minds of graduates from all high schools across Chosŏn (朝鮮), always shows admission results where Japanese make up two-thirds and Koreans one-third. Moreover, according to a Japanese lecturer who once held the teaching baton (敎鞭) at that school, even achieving this ratio was the result of special consideration; if they employed more tricks, they could ensure that not a single Korean person would be admitted. Why is that? Because even setting aside other subjects, the single subject of Japanese language alone could determine the fate of all Korean examinees. This is the so-called highest seat of learning in Chosŏn, the Kyŏngsŏng University that claims to be for Koreans. How much are they planning to torment innocent Korean students with this deceptive signboard (似而非의 廣告板)?

Regardless of elementary schools or high schools, even in the 4th or 5th year, right before graduation, propertyless students (無産學生) frequently drop out mid-term (中途退學). Yet, the human desire for knowledge is strong, and during this spring's entrance period, not only in the Kyŏngsŏng area but elsewhere too, the number of applicants wishing to enter elementary and middle schools seems to greatly exceed the fixed admission quotas. However, looking at how elementary schools in Kyŏngsŏng city select entrants, they first have Korean teachers investigate the household assets of the applicant children. Then, the Japanese principal or head teacher designates a considerable number of children from wealthy homes among them, and the remaining children are expelled (逐出) under the pretense that "the test results were unsatisfactory." Everyone knows that all of today's systems and institutions exist for the propertied class, but it was the remark of a certain propertyless child's parent that they hadn't realized it was so clearly *only* for the wealthy.

Coal Mines in Southern Chosŏn
Although there is lignite (褐炭) in Northern Chosŏn (北鮮) and anthracite (無煙炭) in Western Chosŏn (西鮮), Southern Chosŏn (南朝鮮) lacked coal mines, causing inconvenience for both household and industrial use. Recently, however, in Hwasun (和順), Chŏnnam Province (全南), a coal mine with better quality coal than the Changbalt'an (長髮炭) of Yŏngil County (迎日郡) has been discovered. The coal reserves are estimated to reach about 3 million tons (噸). In any case, good news. <84>

**Summary**

This article comprises three brief reports: the resignation of Irish leader Éamon de Valera from Sinn Féin leadership over strategy towards the Irish Free State oath, accusations in the Japanese Diet that criticism of army generals was funded by Soviet Russia to destabilize the military, and sharp criticism of the educational system in colonial Korea. The Korean section highlights the discriminatory quota system favoring Japanese students at Kyŏngsŏng University and the practice in Kyŏngsŏng elementary schools of explicitly selecting students based on family wealth over merit, effectively barring poor Korean children. For historians, the article offers insights into Korean awareness of international anti-colonial struggles (Ireland), Japanese internal political anxieties regarding communism, and firsthand accounts of the systemic ethnic and class discrimination faced by Koreans within the colonial education system, particularly the blatant wealth-based selection in primary schools.

六號瞥見
注目할 愛蘭의 今後!
愛蘭共和國 大統領으로 명성이 놉흔 「데·바레라」씨는 이번에 「싱·펜」黨 黨首의 지위를 辭하엿다. 其 이유는 愛蘭에는 立憲主義를 奉하는 現愛蘭 自由國政府의 一派와 이에 反한 共和主義를 奉하는 「싱·펜」黨 一派가 잇는대 今番 「데·바레라」씨는 최근 政局에 鑑하야 만일 愛蘭自由國議員이 英皇帝에 대한 충성의 宣*만을 廢하게 되면 共和主義를 奉하는 우리 싱·펜黨員도 自由國議會 議員됨을 承認함이 如何한가」하는 動議를 제출하얏다가 黨員한테서 否決을 당한 故이라 한다. 그러면 愛蘭의 今後가 如何?

日本政客의 赤化?
日本 1의 野黨인 政友會代議士 牧野良三君의 설명에 의하면 이번 議會중, 現政府의 與黨인 憲政會 宣傳部長 中野正剛군의 摘發한 田中, 山梨 兩 大將의 陸軍機密費私用 云云 문제는 赤露의 宣傳費를 밧고 日本군대에 국민적 의혹을 投하야 年前 露國共産黨이 舊露西亞帝國의 국가조직을 崩壞케 하던 그 수단을 仍用한 것이라고 그리고 또 주의할 것은 현 日本人으로 第三 國際共産黨에 가입한 者가 7천 5백명이나 잇는데 그 중에 엇더한 사람이엇는가는 言明할 것도 업다고 하엿다. 여하간 現日本의 政局을 좌우하는 選良들의 하는 일이오 또 말이니 爲先 傾聽해 둘 일.

大學小學이 盖如許
全鮮 高等普通學校 졸업생의 머리속을 폭폭 에여내는 듯이 고달프게 하는 京城大學은 입학생 발표성적을 보면 언제든지 日本人 3분지 2에 朝鮮人 3분의 1의 此이다. 더욱히 그 학교에 敎鞭을 잠던엇던 日本 講師의 말을 드르면 그러케 하는 것도 특별히 생각한 결과로 된 것이지 만일 좀 더 꾀를 쓰면 朝鮮사람은 한 사람을 들지 못하게 할 내도 할 수가 잇다고. 웨 그러냐 하면 다른 과목은 다-말하지 안는다 할 지라도 日語 한 과목이면 모든 朝鮮人 受驗生을 다- 좌우할 수 잇다고. 이것이 소위 朝鮮의 最高學府로서 朝鮮人을 위한다는 京城大學이것다. 이 似而非의 廣告板을 가지고 얼마나 無垢한 朝鮮人 학생을 골릴 모양인고.

普通學敎 高等普通學校를 勿論하고 卒業期를 目前에 둔 4학년, 5학년 말에도 中途*學하는 無産學生이 작고 생기는데 사람의 지식욕이란 그래도 강한 것이여서 今春 入學期에도 京城地方을 勿論하고 小學校 中學校에 入學志願者가 莫集定數를 매우 너문 모양이다. 그런데 京城 시내 普通學敎의 입학생選拔하는 모양을 보면 몬저 朝鮮人敎員으로 그 志願兒童의 家産을 조사케 하고 그 다음 日本人 校長이나 또는 首席이 그 중 재산잇는 집 아동 상당수를 指定하고 그 餘의 아동에게는 「試驗結果 不入格」이라는 意로 逐出하고 만다. 오늘의 모든 제도와 機關이 잇는 계급의 사람을 의하야 잇는 줄은 누구나 아는 일이지만은 요러케도 분명히 잇는 사람만을 위해서 잇는 줄은 물낫다는 것은 엇던 無産兒童 父兄의 말.

南朝鮮의 石炭鑛
北鮮에는 褐炭, 西鮮에는 無煙炭이 잇스나 南朝鮮에는 炭山이 업서서 가정용 공업용에다-가티 불편하더니 근래 全南 和順에서 迎日郡의 長髮炭보다 더 조흔 石炭鑛을 발견하엿는데 炭量도 약 300만噸에 달하리라고 좌우간 好消息.＜84＞
