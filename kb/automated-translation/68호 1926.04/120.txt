**Summary**

This diary from April 1926 chronicles events from mid-February to mid-March 1926, covering international affairs, particularly the political turmoil and foreign interventions in China (Taku Incident, warlord conflicts, ultimatums), European politics (Germany joining League of Nations, French cabinet changes, Polish monarchist movement), and independence movements (Philippines). It also details significant events within the Japanese Empire, including labor strikes, political resignations, disasters, and importantly, news directly impacting colonial Korea. Korean-related entries report on the execution of an independence fighter (Yang Sŭngu), the trial of Pak Yŏl, anti-Christian sentiment, crackdowns on Samil Day commemorations, labor organizing and strikes (Wŏnsan, Kwangju, Iksan, Mokp'o), student activism (Taegu, Sariwŏn), the suspension of the Tong-A Ilbo newspaper, and the movements of the Korean Crown Prince.

For historians of colonial Korea, this diary is valuable as it juxtaposes domestic Korean resistance, social movements, and colonial oppression (arrests, executions, surveillance on Samil Day, newspaper suspension) against the backdrop of major international events, especially the instability in China which directly involved Japan and other colonial powers. The entries on labor organizing (Kwangju, Iksan, Wŏnsan, Mokp'o), student strikes (Taegu, Sariwŏn), and the Pak Yŏl trial highlight the diverse forms of Korean social and political mobilization during this period, while incidents like the unprovoked killing of a Korean youth by a Japanese policeman in Samsu underscore the violence of colonial rule. The mention of the withheld Russian flood relief funds also points to the complexities of international solidarity and Japanese control.
