Special Announcement

Regarding all matters concerning the expansion of the Kaebyŏk Company (開闢社), which has been previously proposed and is currently underway, we will make an announcement starting from the upcoming May issue. We ask everyone (僉位) to please take note.

April, Byŏngin Year [1926]
Kaebyŏk Company (開闢社) <93>

**Summary**

This brief announcement informs readers of the magazine *Kaebyŏk* that details about the planned expansion of its publishing company, Kaebyŏk-sa, will be revealed in the following month's issue (May 1926). It uses formal and slightly archaic language to respectfully address the readership. For historians, this notice signals the growth and potential strategic shifts of a significant Korean cultural and intellectual publication during the colonial period, hinting at its operational status and future plans amidst the constraints of Japanese rule.
