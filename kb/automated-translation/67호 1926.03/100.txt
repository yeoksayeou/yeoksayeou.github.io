**Summary**

This article is a "Social Diary" chronologically listing significant events from January 16th to February 15th, 1926. It covers international affairs, particularly conflicts and political maneuvering involving China (Chang Tso-lin, Chinese Eastern Railway dispute with Russia, internal politics), Japan (cabinet changes, political groups, incidents involving Koreans), Russia, Germany, Italy, Britain, and the US. It also details domestic events within colonial Korea, including school disputes (Koch'ang, P'yŏngyang), fires, legal cases (Pak Yŏl, Hong Nam-p'yo, Yun U-yŏl, Sŏ Tong-il, Hong Yŏng-jŏn), activities of armed resistance groups, social conflicts (Hyŏngp'yŏng Society), protests against colonial enterprises (Kyŏngsŏng Electric), and incidents of violence involving Japanese authorities and Korean civilians (Mie Prefecture, Songhwa County, Hiroshima). For historians, this diary offers a valuable snapshot of the interconnectedness of global and regional events affecting Korea, highlights various forms of Korean resistance and social tension under colonial rule (ideological groups, student protests, armed groups, labor actions), and records specific incidents like the controversial death of Yi Wan-yong and conflicts between Koreans and Japanese both in Korea and Japan.
