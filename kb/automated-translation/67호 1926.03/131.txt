Apology Notice

The March issue of this magazine came into conflict with the authorities' taboos (當局의 忌諱) and was consequently banned from sale on February 24th. Our company intended to promptly issue an extra edition, but there were separate issues with the authorities (當局). Only now have we managed to publish the extra edition. Please do not ask about right or wrong. Our company can only apologize to all the readers under heaven for being so late.

Kaebyŏksa Paek <90>

**Summary**

This brief notice from the publisher, Kaebyŏksa, apologizes to readers for the significant delay in issuing an extra edition of the magazine *Kaebyŏk*. The delay occurred because the original March issue was banned by "the authorities" on February 24th for conflicting with their "taboos," and subsequent unspecified "separate issues" with the authorities further postponed the extra edition. The publisher explicitly asks readers not to inquire into the reasons ("right or wrong") for the ban and delay. For historians, this text is a clear example of the censorship and pressure exerted by the Japanese colonial authorities on Korean publications in the 1920s. The euphemistic language used to describe the reasons for the ban and the publisher's reticence highlight the risks involved in publishing potentially sensitive content during this period.
