That Year, That Month, That Day, That Time
						P Saeng

K Hyŏng. Do you remember, Hyŏng? I mean, do you remember that year, that month, that day, that time? Thinking back, it seems like a dream, yet also like reality. If one were to call it joyful, it was the most joyful event; if one were to call it sad, it was as sad as waking from an immortal's dream. But anyway, it was the first time such a thing had happened in my entire life. No, it wouldn't just be me, would it?

K Hyŏng. You and I grew up holding onto our fathers' coattails in houses next to each other, and eventually, didn't we experience that year, that month, that day, that time together? Didn't you, Hyŏng, ultimately sacrifice your body for that cause? You clearly remember what happened then, don't you? Though our worlds are now different (幽明), having sacrificed your body for that cause, how could your spirit not remember?

K Hyŏng. On this day, how about thinking back once more? At that time, you were sitting in the warmest part of the room, I sat next to you, next to me sat my cousin (八寸兄님), and next to him sat my father. Like that, a total of four people were sitting, talking about church matters and worldly affairs, waiting for someone, not parting ways even after eleven at night. Wasn't it right at that moment? Wasn't there the loud sound of dogs barking outside the gate, and someone rushing in, panting?
The voice calling, "Mr. Pak," wasn't it clearly the voice of the errand boy from the parish (敎區)? At that time, like someone caught red-handed while stealing, while forcibly calming my thumping heart, didn't I go out to meet him, saying, "Ah, what brings you here? What is this, so late at night?" Weren't you surprised too, Hyŏng, and wasn't my father also surprised? In the end—what came out from inside that errand boy's clothes? What did we do when we saw it?

K Hyŏng. What did that boy take out? Do you remember? It wasn't a notice (通牒), nor an official letter (公函), nor a private letter (私簡), was it? It definitely wasn't, right? Don't be surprised. Wasn't it a Declaration (宣言書)? Wasn't it the long Declaration stating, "We hereby <95> declare that Korea is..."? It was, wasn't it? It definitely was, right? Do you remember the signatories too?

K Hyŏng. At that time, what did we do when we saw it? Did we dance? Did we sing? No. As if waking from a terrifying dream, weren't our eyes wide for a while, unable to comprehend what was happening? That's how I clearly remember it. Only after considering the world situation (世界大勢) and recalling Mr. Wilson's (월손氏) proposals seen in the newspaper a few days earlier, didn't we jump for joy as if it were reality?

K Hyŏng. Thinking about that time, it truly seems laughable and dreamlike. Didn't I instantly become the County Magistrate (郡守) and you the County Secretary (郡主事)? Blindly—no, didn't we talk about provincial governors and magistrates without any basis? Do you remember those words? Didn't my cousin—with his halting speech—jump up and down, saying, "That younger brother (pointing at me) has secured the position of County Magistrate. County Magistrate—... And that younger brother (pointing at you, Hyŏng) has secured the position of County Secretary. County Secretary!"? Hearing this, weren't we delighted, saying "Indeed!" and doing shoulder dances one after another? Aside from that, what about my father's words? Didn't he say, "Living life, times like these must pop up now and then for life to be interesting. Anyway, the effort of educating you has paid off!" and wasn't he puffed up with pride at being the Magistrate's father? Didn't even my stooped grandmother rise from her seat asking, "Our boy became a Magistrate?" and didn't my mother, who had been bowing nearby, move closer, chattering, "Our humble father's grave site is truly a propitious spot (명당)!"? And didn't my wife, who was sewing, just keep smiling gently?

K Hyŏng. Thinking about that time, it's truly laughable. Isn't there a limit even to the rice cake in the jar (proverb: pie in the sky)? Knowing full well since ancient times that there's no such thing as gaining without labor (不勞自得), didn't we act so recklessly and inflate ourselves with empty hope? Thinking about it makes my face tingle with embarrassment. At that time, we had no time to even consider how much real strength (實力) Korea had, or what level (程度) the Korean people had reached. Truly—we were ridiculous humans. Honestly, we were humans fit only to be mock Magistrates. I'm definitely not saying all Koreans were like that. I mean that we humans, you and I, who were sitting in that spot at that time, were like that. <96>

K Hyŏng. At that time, despite it being the middle of the night, didn't the four of us—you, my cousin, that boy, and I—set off for the town (邑) thirty li away? Didn't we cross paddy ridges and field ridges in the pitch-dark night, falling and stumbling, yet joyfully and gladly rushing towards the town? Don't you remember crossing that stream then? When both you and I were about to take off our foot wrappings, didn't my cousin rush over, saying, "Hey, how can the Honorable Magistrate (郡守令監) take off his foot wrappings? Let me carry you across," stopping us both from removing them, and didn't he carry us both across on his back (越川)? Thinking about it brings a burst of laughter.

K Hyŏng. After that, didn't you take charge of the work in the town, Hyŏng, while I came up to Seoul? Didn't you, Hyŏng, ultimately spend three years in prison (獄中生活) because of that work, eventually contracting an illness there and becoming a guest who never returned (不歸의 客)? That's what happened, wasn't it? K Hyŏng. It definitely happened that way, didn't it? I feel ashamed facing you, Hyŏng. But I suppose it was a phase in our process. I just deeply think about better times ahead.

K Hyŏng. Since you left, Hyŏng, there hasn't been much to speak of in Korea yet. The knowledge and thought of the general populace must have evolved considerably compared to that time. But on the other hand, the hardship of life (生活苦) is no small matter. The economic ruin (經濟的破滅) of the Korean people is tilting towards an indescribable peak (絶頂). However, on the other hand, the fierce rise of the social movement (社會運動) seems to offer considerable hope for the construction of a new society (新社會建設).

K Hyŏng. There are many constraints, so I cannot go into detail. I will only tell you that there are three main ideologies (主義) in Korea. They are Socialism (社會主義), Nationalism (民族主義), and Japan-Korea Assimilationism (日鮮同化主義). Besides these, there are also the Cultivation of Strength Faction (實力養成派), the Autonomy Faction (自治派), and perhaps Superstition Factions (迷信派), but the most prominent and dominant one, even more so than Nationalism, is Socialism. Please know this much. (February 15th) <97>

**Summary**

The author, P Saeng, writes a poignant letter to his deceased friend, K Hyŏng, reminiscing about their shared experience during the March 1st Movement of 1919. He recalls the night they received the Declaration of Independence, their naive excitement, and their dreams of immediately taking up positions like County Magistrate and Secretary in an independent Korea. He contrasts this past hope with the present reality of 1926: K Hyŏng's death resulting from imprisonment, the author's feelings of shame and disillusionment, the severe economic hardship faced by Koreans, but also the rise of social movements. The letter concludes by outlining the main competing ideologies in contemporary Korea: Socialism, Nationalism, and Assimilationism, noting the growing strength of Socialism.

This article is valuable for historians as a personal, emotional account of the initial impact and subsequent disillusionment following the March 1st Movement. It provides insight into the immediate, perhaps unrealistic, hopes the Declaration inspired among some individuals, contrasting sharply with the harsh colonial reality. Furthermore, its 1926 perspective on the prevailing ideological currents—specifically naming Socialism, Nationalism, Assimilationism, and factions like the 'Cultivation of Strength' and 'Autonomy' groups—offers a contemporary snapshot of the political and social landscape of colonial Korea. The mention of Socialism's growing prominence is particularly noteworthy.

K兄. 이 날에 잇서 또 한번 생각함이 엇덜까요? 그때의 兄은 웃목에 안고 나는 그 다음에 안고 그 다음에는 나의 八寸兄님이 안고 그 다음에는 나의 아버님이 안즈시고 그리해서 都合 네 사람이 안저 敎會 니약이 世上 니약이를 말해 가면서 누구를 기다리는 듯 밤 열한時가 지나도록 헤여지지 안코 잇지 안엇슴닛가. 바로 그때가 안임닛가? 문밧게서 개짓는 소리 요란히 나며 누가 씩은씩은 드러오지 안엇슴니가?

K兄. 兄가신 뒤의 朝鮮은 別로 이럿타 할 것이 아직 업슴니다. 一般人民의 智識이나 思想은 그때보다 활신 進化되얏겟지오. 그러나 反面에 生活苦는 여간이 안임니다. 朝鮮人의 經濟的破滅이란 말할 수 업는 絶頂으로 기우러짐니다. 그러나 反面에 社會運動이 猛烈히 니러나는 것은 新社會建設의 對한 적지 안은 希望인가 함니다

K兄. 거리끼우는 데가 만하서 仔細한 말슴은 못하겟슴니다. 다만 朝鮮에 세가지 主義가 잇다는 것뿐 알켜 드림니다. 그것은 社會主義 民族主義 日鮮同化主義 그것이외다. 그밧게 實力養成派 自治派 또는 迷信派들도 잇스나 가장 顯著하고 또 優勢한 것은 民族主義보다도 社會主義 그것임니다. 이쯤 아러 주십시오. (二月十五日)＜97＞
