京城雜語 (Miscellaneous Talk from Kyŏngsŏng)

Yi Wan-yong, who they kept saying was dying, finally died for good on February 12th. Yi Chae-myŏng in the underworld must be laughing, saying, "Ah, that rascal is finally dead," but the widow with bad fortune and those enjoying privileges will grieve more than others. However, the exploiters (搾除夫) of Kyŏngsŏng-bu will probably offer congratulations, saying, "From now on, the walls of public places (共同所) will be clean, which is better than anything."

Speaking of the deceased nobleman (爵者), after Song Pyŏng-jun died, there was quite a fuss over the issue of settling his assets. Recently, his son, Song Pyŏng-jun [likely referring to the inheritor, possibly a typo and meant Song Chin-u or another relative, but the text repeats the name], fell for the trickery of some lawyer, resulting in double and triple debts. Consequently, the family's financial advisor, Sase Taishitsu (佐瀨態鐵), after consulting with the so-called Chairman of the Song Family Asset Settlement Committee and Director of the Government-General's Bureau of Education, Yi Chin-ho, sealed the Song family's important documents and other records (文簿) in a safe (金庫) to prevent the son's (其子) free disposal of assets. They also restricted living expenses, putting the entire family in extreme hardship, it is said.

It is utterly impossible for ill-gotten wealth to be passed down to descendants (傳之子孫), but Yi Wan-yong, unlike Song Pyŏng-jun, not only had no debts while alive but was also called Kyŏngsŏng's foremost cash millionaire (現金富豪). Therefore, immediately after his death, there probably won't be such financial difficulties as the Song family faced. However, worldly affairs (世事) are difficult to predict (豫想키 難한 바), so how about Kyŏngsŏng-bu presses for overdue (밀닌) school fees (學校費)?

A certain Japanese magazine published in Kyŏngsŏng reviewed the Government-General's new office building, saying, "Its extreme splendor and luxury are like Qin Shi Huang's Epang Palace (阿房宮)." Does this mean it will fall in the second generation (二世而亡)?

When Administrative Superintendent Yuasa (湯淺), attending the Japanese Diet, was fiercely questioned by Diet member Matsuyama (松山) about land annexation (土地兼倂) in Chosŏn, he reportedly vehemently argued that Chosŏn has no such harmful effects (弊害). Even if Mr. Yuasa attended to tell lies, how could he recklessly tell lies that would shame his conscience (良心)? It would be better to explain, "As this is the beginning of a new administration (新政之初), I know nothing about the situation (事情) in Chosŏn."

From the time of annexation (倂合當時) until the last fiscal year (昨年度), the total annual expenditure (歲出總計) of the Chosŏn Government-General was 1,441.76 million Yen, of which government enterprise expenses (官業費) were 516.89 million Yen, police expenses (警務費) were 164.62 million Yen, while education expenses (敎育費) were merely 48 million Yen, and medical and sanitation expenses (醫務及衛生費) did not exceed 17 million Yen. Furthermore, the Government-General's total debt (負債總額) amounts to 273 million Yen, with annual interest payments (利子支出) reaching over 23 million Yen. In the end (決局), the Government-General's rule is not politics for its own benefit, but politics intended to incur debt. However, since the police expenses are so large, no one will likely dare to carry out forced execution (强制執行) or declare bankruptcy (破産宣告) recklessly.

The Japanese Ministry of Home Affairs (內務省) reportedly seized 150,000 Yen in famine relief funds (飢餓救濟金) coming from Labor-Farmer Russia (勞農露西亞). Now, the Chosŏn Prosecutor's Office (檢事局) has also seized 20,000 Yen in relief funds coming from Russia (露國). It seems saving themselves is more urgent than saving disaster victims (災民).

The Prosecutor's Office that seized the funds is one thing, but what was the real intention (本意가 那邊에 잇슬가) of the person who received relief funds for people on the verge of death and, instead of distributing them promptly (卽速), improperly (單濁히) deposited (任置) them in a bank, only to have them seized? Unless the relief fund was originally capital (資本金) for a moneylending business (貸金業), what reason was there to deposit it in a bank?

A young man from India (印度) is traveling around the world by automobile (自動車), while a young man from Haeju in Chosŏn plans to travel around Chosŏn by bicycle (自轉車), it is said (云). That too is more commendable (壯) than doing nothing. But, as fellow youths, isn't it a little shameful (붓끄럽지 안이할가)? How about striving (分發) once more?

Upon hearing that Yi Wan-yong had died, Yi Pyŏng-mu reportedly sighed deeply (長歎), saying, "The elder statesmen (元老) of Old Korea (舊韓國) are almost all dying." What are these elder statesmen? Isn't an old monkey (猿老) also a *wŏllo*? This is what they call "when the fox dies, the rabbit grieves" (狐死兎悲).

Perhaps because the authorities (當局) are good at seizing things (押收), they got carried away (억개 바람이 낫는지), like children getting a taste for tobacco (兒孩들 苦草장 먹듯이), and even seized the wall newspaper (壁新聞) of the Sinhŭng Youth Association (新興靑年會). This is truly a case of talking to a wall (壁窓戶의 일이다). (Ch'ajŏnja 車賤者) <89>

**Summary**

This satirical column from the March 1926 issue of *Kaebyŏk* magazine comments on various events in Kyŏngsŏng (colonial Seoul). It notes the death of the notorious pro-Japanese collaborator Yi Wan-yong with sarcasm, contrasts his wealth with the debt-ridden family of another collaborator, Song Pyŏng-jun, and criticizes the colonial government's spending priorities (huge police budget vs. meager education/health funds), its officials' dishonesty regarding land issues, and its seizure of Russian famine relief funds meant for Koreans. The author also mocks the resignation of collaborators like Yi Pyŏng-mu and contrasts the ambitions of Korean youth (a bicycle trip around Korea) unfavorably with international peers (an Indian youth's round-the-world car trip), ending with a critique of censorship targeting even wall newspapers. The article is interesting to historians for its candid and biting critique of colonial realities, collaborators, and government policies, reflecting the socio-political atmosphere and nationalist sentiment of the time. The commentary on budget allocation, land issues, censorship, and the fate of collaborators provides valuable insights into Korean perspectives under Japanese rule.

京城雜語
죽는다 죽는다하던 李完用은 2月 12日에 아주 죽고 말엇다. 地下에 잇는 李在明은 「아-이놈이 인제야 죽엇구나」하고 웃겟지만은 八字구진 과부며 누리는 남유달리 더 슬퍼할 것이다. 그런데 京城府의 搾除夫들은 또 「이재부터는 共同*所의 壁이 깨긋해 지깻스닛가 무엇보다도 조켓다고」致賀하겟지.
죽은 爵者의 말이 나스닛가 말이지 宋秉晙이 죽은 뒤에 財産정리問題로 말성이 퍽 만터니 近來에 其子 宋秉晙은 엇던 辯護士의 후림 때에 또 빠저서 二重三重이 負債가 생긴 까닭에 同家財政顧問 佐瀨態鐵은 所謂 宋氏家財産整理委員長兼總督府學務局長 李軫鎬氏와 協議한 結果 宋家의 重要書類其他文簿를 金庫에 封鎖하야 其于의 財産自由처분을 防止하고 또 生活費까지 제한하야 全家族의 生活이 極困中에 잇다 한다.
不義로 모든 財産이 元來傳之子孫하기는 萬無의 *이지만은 李完用은 宋秉晙처럼 生前에 負債가 업슬 뿐 안이라 京城 第一流의 現金富豪 稱呼를 드럿스닌가 死後 즉시에 宋家처럼 그러한 生活困難問題는 업슬 것이다. 그러나 世事는 豫想키 難한 바인 즉 京城府에서는 밀닌 學校費나 從遠督俸함이 何如

京城에서 發行하는 某日本人雜誌는 總督府의 新廳舍를 評하야 曰 華麗極侈함이 秦始皇의 阿房宮 갓다고 하얏다. 그러면 二世而()하라는 말인가.

日本議會에 出席한 湯淺政務摠監은 松山代議士가 朝鮮의 土地兼倂에 對하야 猛烈히 質問을 하닛가 朝鮮은 그러한 弊害가 업다고 極力辨明하얏다 한다. 아모리 거짓말하기 爲하야 出席한 湯淺君이라도 良心에 부끄러운 거진말이야 엇지 함부루 하랴. 차아리 「나는 新政之初가 되엿서 朝鮮事情을 아모 것도 모른다고」 辨明하는 것이 조켓다.

倂合當時로부터 昨年度까지 朝鮮總督府의 歲出總計는 14억4천1백76만圓인데 其中 官業費는 5억1천6백89만圓, 警務費는 1억6천4백62만圓이고 敎育費는 僅히 4천8백만圓, 醫務及衛生費는 1천7백만圓에 不過하며 又同府의 負債總額은 2억7천3백만圓으로 年 利子支出이 2천3백餘萬圓에 達한다고 하니 決局 總督政治는 自己自體로도 利益보다는 政治가 안이라 負債를 하랴는 政治다. 그러나 警務費가 多大하닛가 누가 함부로 强制執行하거나 破産宣告는 잘 못하겟지.

日本內務省에서는 勞農露西亞에서 오는 飢餓救濟金15만圓를 押收하얏다더니 朝鮮檢事局에서는 또 露國에서 오는 救濟金 2만圓을 押收하얏스니 *災民救濟보다 自己救濟가 더 急한 모양이지.

押收한 檢事局도 檢事局이어니와 當場에 죽게 된 사람의 救濟金을 바다가지고 卽速 分配치 안이하고 單濁히 銀行에 任貸하얏다가 押收를 當하게 한 그 사람의 心事는 本意가 那邊에 잇슬가. 원래에 구제金이 貸金業의 資本金이 안인 以上에야 銀行에 任置할 것이 무엇잇나.

印度靑年은 自動車로 世界一周旅行을 하는데 朝鮮의 海州靑年은 自轉車로 朝鮮一周旅行을 계획한다 云한다. 그것도 안이하는 것보다는 壯할 것이다. 그러나 가튼 靑年으로 조금 붓끄럽지 안이할가. 더 한번 분발함이 何如.

李秉武는 李完用의 죽엇단 말을 듯고는 「舊韓國의 元老도 거진다 죽는다」고 長歎하더라니 元老란 다 무엇이냐. 원숭이 늙은 것이 猿老가 안이냐. 이것이 曰 狐死兎悲다.

當局에서는 押收를 잘한다하닛가 兒孩들 苦草장 먹듯이 억개 바람이 낫는지 新興靑年會의 壁新聞까지 또 押收하얏다. 이것이야말로 참 壁窓戶의 일이다.(車賤者)＜89＞
