鬱陵島行
						堤川 丁生

東行千里又登船, 大海茫茫去路前
何似乘槎銀浦客, 自疑逐水武陵仙
暗中白浪如危地, 忽上紅輪更曙天
汽笛數聲來泊島, 人家隱映樹雲邊
(於舟中)

Traveling a thousand li east, again I board a ship,
Before me lies the road ahead, across the vast, boundless sea.
Am I not like the traveler riding a raft to the Silver Inlet (Milky Way)?
I half suspect I'm an immortal from Wuling (Peach Blossom Spring), following the stream.
In the darkness, white waves resemble perilous cliffs,
Suddenly, the red wheel (sun) rises, and the sky dawns anew.
Several blasts from the steam whistle, and we arrive to moor at the island,
Houses are faintly visible amidst the trees and clouds.
(On the boat)

曾聞此島東海濱, 地秘天藏隔世塵
徐市來時知有藥, 田橫往事問無人
白鶴夜眠玄圃洞, 紫霞春熟碧桃隣
箇中居住千餘戶, 厚俗淳風自善仁
(於島中客舍)

I had heard this island lies on the edge of the East Sea,
A land hidden by heaven, secluded from worldly dust.
Did Xu Fu (徐市) know there were herbs here when he came?
Of Tian Heng's (田橫) past deeds, there is no one left to ask.
White cranes sleep at night in Hyŏnp'o-dong (玄圃洞),
Purple mists in spring ripen near the green peaches (碧桃).
Within here reside over a thousand households,
With generous customs and simple ways, naturally kind and benevolent.
(At an inn on the island)

群峯羅立自名村, 環四如屛鎖洞門
曲逕穿林懸石壁, 長桶橫野引泉源
渾忘塵累湖中遠, 始覺仙區海上存
幸借雲牕經夜枕, 主人雅操世情論.
(於羅里洞書堂)＜66＞

Peaks stand arrayed, naturally forming villages,
Surrounding on four sides like a screen, locking the valley gates.
Winding paths pierce the forest below hanging stone cliffs,
Long troughs cross the fields, drawing water from springs.
Completely forgetting worldly cares, far off amidst the caldera,
I realize for the first time that a fairy realm (仙區) exists upon the sea.
Fortunate to borrow a cloud-view window for a night's rest,
Discussing worldly affairs with the host of elegant integrity.
(At the village school in Nari-dong) <66>

**Summary**

This three-stanza Hanmun poem by "Chech'ŏn Chŏngsaeng" describes a journey to Ullŭng Island in 1923. It covers the sea voyage, the initial impression of the island as a secluded paradise with simple, virtuous inhabitants (drawing on Chinese historical and mythical allusions like Xu Fu, Tian Heng, and Daoist imagery), and a stay in the Nari basin, depicted as a beautiful, isolated 'fairy realm'. The poem emphasizes the island's natural beauty and its perceived separation from the mundane world. For historians, the article offers insight into how some Korean intellectuals viewed peripheral regions like Ullŭngdo during the colonial period – romanticizing its isolation and 'pure' customs, potentially as an escape from or contrast to the realities of colonial modernity and mainland politics. The use of classical Chinese poetry itself reflects the persistence of traditional literary forms among certain educated circles even amidst cultural shifts.
