北歐旅舍에서, 9월 15일 朴勝喆
						朴勝喆

My interesting trip to Northern Europe (北歐旅行) is now drawing near its end (終幕). After passing through various places, last night (昨夜) I arrived in the capital city (首府) of the Kingdom of Sweden (瑞典國), and tomorrow night (明夜) I intend to visit the nation of Finland (芬蘭國), located north of Russia (露國), and return to Germany (歸獨) around the 25th or 26th. Upon returning to Germany, I plan to write and send my Northern Europe travelogue (北歐旅記). (Arrived at the Main Office [本社] October 26th)＜84＞

**Summary**

This short correspondence by Pak Sŭngch'ŏl (朴勝喆), sent from Stockholm, Sweden on September 15th, 1923, informs the Kaebyŏk magazine that his Northern European tour is nearing completion. He outlines his immediate plan to visit Finland before returning to Germany around September 25th/26th, after which he intends to write a travelogue about his journey. The note itself reached the magazine's office on October 26th. For historians, this piece offers a glimpse into the activities and mobility of Korean intellectuals abroad during the colonial period. Pak Sŭngch'ŏl's ability to travel extensively in Europe and his intention to publish a travelogue in a major Korean magazine highlight continued intellectual engagement and attempts to broaden Korean perspectives despite colonial constraints. His mention of specific countries like Sweden, Finland, and Germany provides concrete details about his itinerary.
