全朝鮮 庭球大會를 보고
						一記者

Tennis tournament, tennis tournament, the All-Korea Tennis Tournament. This is a meaningful and beneficial large gathering hosted by the Chosŏn Sports Association (朝鮮体育會), held once a year, where the descendants of Paedal [Koreans] from all over Chosŏn select and send their region's superior athletes to compete. This tournament is the 4th one, and it has progressed step by step along the path of development, advancing day by day and month by month (日就月將), achieving remarkable success this time. Not only was the number of participating organizations large, but many local organizations participated, and what was particularly distinctive was the participation of young athletes from the Elementary School Division (小學團).

Reviewing (點考) the participating organizations, listing them from afar: the Elementary School Division from Sŏnch'ŏn Public Primary (宣川公普), the Youth Division (靑年團) from Sunch'ŏn Regional Youth Association (順天지방청년회), the Youth Division from Hamhŭng Sports Club (咸興運動部), the Youth Division from P'yŏngyang Sungsil College (平壤崇實大學), the Elementary School Division from Chinnamp'o Public Primary (鎭南浦公普), the Middle School Division (中學團) from P'yŏngyang Kwangsŏng Higher Common School (平壤光成高普), the Youth Division from Wŏnsan Youth Association (元山청년회), the Youth Division from Kaesŏng Nammun*Pŏp Youth Association (開城南門*法청년회), the Middle School Division from Kaesŏng Songbo (開城松普), the Elementary School Division from Kaesŏng First and Second Primary Education (開城第一第二普敎), and from Seoul: the Youth Division from Hwimun (徽文), the Youth Division of its trainees (同講習生), the Youth Division from Kŭmgang Tennis Club (金剛庭球部), the Youth Division from the Law College (法學專門), the Youth Division from Yŏnhŭi College (延禧專門), the Youth Division from Posŏng College (普成專門), the Middle School Division from Hwimun Higher Common School (徽文高普), the Middle School Division from Paejae Higher Common School (培材高普), the Middle School Division from Yangjŏng Higher Common School (養正高普), the Middle School Division from Tonggwang Higher Common School (東光高普), the Elementary School Division from Inch'ŏn Public Primary (仁川公普), and the Elementary School Division from Posŏng Primary (普成初等).

The original plan was to hold the opening ceremony at 8:00 AM and start the matches immediately after, but due to the unexpected heavy rain (暴雨) the previous night and the fickle weather (日氣) that morning, the opening ceremony and the return ceremony for the championship flag (優勝旗) were held around 9:30 AM, and the tournament began around 10:00 AM with the preliminary matches of the Elementary School Division. First, the match between Chinnamp'o Public Primary and Kaesŏng Primary Education (開城普敎) began, with Chinnamp'o winning and Kaesŏng Primary Education losing. Then, Sŏnch'ŏn Public Primary and Kaesŏng Primary Education faced off (相戰), and again Kaesŏng was defeated (敗北). Afterward, the winners Chinnamp'o Public Primary and Sŏnch'ŏn Public Primary, along with Inch'ŏn Public Primary and Posŏng Primary, who had advanced with byes, drew lots (抽籤). As a result, in the second round of preliminaries, Posŏng Primary and Inch'ŏn Public Primary played, with Inch'ŏn Public Primary raising the white flag [surrendering] and Posŏng Primary achieving victory (勝戰). Next, a fierce battle commenced between Chinnamp'o and Sŏnch'ŏn, with Chinnamp'o being defeated and withdrawing, thus concluding the Elementary School Division preliminaries.

Next, the Middle School Division matches continued. First, the competition between Yangjŏng Higher Common School and Tonggwang Higher Common School began, with Yangjŏng winning and Tonggwang being defeated. Following that, a fierce match unfolded between Hwimun Higher Common School (徽高) and Paejae Higher Common School (培材), where Paejae was soundly defeated and Hwimun won decisively. Afterward, the two winners, Hwimun and Yangjŏng, along with the two teams that advanced with byes, Songdo Higher Common School (松高) and Kwangsŏng Higher Common School (光成), drew lots for opponents. As a result, the match between Hwimun and Songdo began first. However, as the short autumn daylight began to turn red, the umpire (審判) announced that if it got too dark to continue, the game scores would be kept as they were and the match postponed until the next morning (明朝), after which the match started. The competition between these two teams (템) was one of the most interesting matches of this tournament. Hwimun harbored resentment (한) from a bitter defeat after a fierce battle with Songdo for years (잇해 동안), while Songdo would permanently keep the championship flag as a symbol of three consecutive years of victory if they won just this time. Therefore, the match between the two teams was a white-hot battle (白熱戰). After the first pair from both sides fought a long and fierce battle (猛戰), Songdo's first pair was defeated (꺽기인 후). Then, as it got dark (날이 점으러서), the remaining games were postponed to the next day, and the day's events concluded. (Recorded on the 15th)

However, there was a matter of great regret (遺憾) regarding that day's competition. It was that the court (코트) was imperfect, which became a major hindrance to the athletes' play. Due to the heavy rain the previous night, the newly made court, sadly rendering the hard work (專工) of those who built it futile, had turned into a muddy mess (진쿠렁이). Furthermore, as sunlight (햇발) was barely visible that day,<100> the court remained wet (물긔) and muddy (질쳑거리여서) until the closing, which was a great regret as every player could not fully showcase their skills (技能).

Today is the second day. Yesterday, it was thought that the court would harden (굿으리라고) by this morning, but this morning it still hadn't hardened much (굿지를 못햇다). Having no choice (하는 수 업시), it was decided to use the court at the east athletic field prepared by Hwimun until the morning. Thus, from 9:00 AM, though cramped, the matches inevitably (不得己) began. Unfortunately, because I was responsible (責任) for court management (管理), I could not watch the morning matches and thus do not know the details. However, somehow, Songdo, with their leading pair still remaining [from the previous day], was soundly defeated by Hwimun's second pair. Kwangsŏng Higher Common School lost to Yangjŏng Higher Common School, concluding the Middle School Division preliminaries. Subsequently, the Youth Division preliminary competitions began. First, Yŏnhŭi and Hwimun Trainees (徽文講習) fought, with Hwimun Trainees winning. Next, there was a match between Posŏng College and Kŭmgang, where Posŏng College reportedly suffered a crushing defeat. Afterward, as the repairs to the newly made court were finished, activities moved to the main athletic field (大運動場), and matches continued from around 1:30 PM. The match between Wŏnsan Youth and Kaesŏng Youth began, which was quite a fierce battle. Eventually, Kaesŏng was defeated and Wŏnsan won (익이엇다). With this, the first round of preliminaries ended. The winners – Kŭmgang, Hwimun Trainees, Wŏnsan – and the five organizations that advanced with byes – Hamhŭng Sports Club, All Hwimun (全徽文), Sunch'ŏn Youth, Law College, Sungsil College – combined and drew lots for the second round of preliminary matches. First, Hamhŭng and Hwimun Trainees fought (싸호게 되야), and Hwimun Trainees were soundly defeated. Second, there was a match between All Hwimun and Wŏnsan Youth, where Wŏnsan Youth was defeated. Next, there was a match between Sunch'ŏn Youth and Kŭmgang, where Kŭmgang won decisively. As it was already getting dark (날이 임의 졈으러서), the day ended, and it was decided to continue the next day. Continued on the morning of the 17th. In the match between Sungsil and Law College, Law College won decisively. Next, the third round of preliminaries began. Hamhŭng and Kŭmgang fought, with Kŭmgang winning. Then, the competition between Law College and All Hwimun (올徽文) started, and this match was truly a white-hot battle (白熱戰). All Hwimun's first pair defeated Law College's two pairs and retired with distinction (優退). Then, Law College's leading pair came out and struck down (뭇질은 후) All Hwimun's second and leading pairs. Finally, facing All Hwimun's distinguished retired pair, they barely managed to defeat them in a situation of one win and one loss (一勝一負의 형세), and Law College ultimately secured victory.

Now, all preliminaries were finished, and the finals began, starting with the Elementary School Division. However, the final matches were not very interesting (滋味가 업섯다). The match between Sŏnch'ŏn Public Primary and Posŏng Primary felt quite like watching a fight between a fierce tiger (猛虎) and a dog. Sŏnch'ŏn's leading pair didn't even have to play (出戰도 하지 못하고) as they won decisively. In the Middle School Division final between Hwimun Higher Common School and Yangjŏng Higher Common School, Hwimun's leading pair also did not have to play, as Yangjŏng suffered a crushing defeat. Next, in the Youth Division final between Law College and Kŭmgang, although the leading pairs from both sides got to play, and Kŭmgang's second pair was defeated, in the end, Law College suffered a crushing defeat as well. [Translator's note: The text says 法專이 참패를 하엿다 - Law College suffered a crushing defeat, but given Kŭmgang won the championship later, this seems like a mistake and likely meant Kŭmgang won / Law College lost.]

Thus, the competition concluded, and there was a ceremony for awarding the honorable championship flags and prizes. Among them, the Kŭmgang Tennis Club, the winner of the Youth Division, won for the third consecutive time, thus getting to keep the championship flag permanently.

Looking back at the performance records (戰跡) of the three divisions, in the Elementary School Division, the skills (技能) of the Kaesŏng Primary School students (開城普校生) were quite unified (일매졋스며) and seemed considerable. While it's unavoidable that students from Sŏnch'ŏn and Chinnamp'o Public Primary were older and larger due to different school entrance ages (입學年齡) in the provinces, it was regrettable (미안한 일) for the younger children that they were no match (적수가 되지 안는 것) for the elementary school students from Kaesŏng or Seoul. And in the Middle School Division, the Hwimun Higher Common School team, and in the Youth Division, the Kŭmgang Tennis Club, were clearly seen to be stronger (굿센 것을 알 수가 잇섯다) than the other teams.

Observing the attitude (態度) of the players and the general spectators (一般觀衆) yesterday, everyone has become more dignified (정중해졋다). Last year was better than the year before, and this year, the spirit of sportsmanship has spread many times more (몃 배나) than last year. The players' minds (精神) have become calm (冷靜해 젓스며), and the spectators' attitudes have become dignified, showing that they seem to have fully understood (이해하게 된 모양이다) that the spirit of athletic competition lies not merely in the obsession with winning and losing (勝癖), but in fighting well and competing fairly (善戰善鬪함에 잇다는 것).<101>

**Summary**

This 1923 article reports on the 4th All-Korea Tennis Tournament hosted by the Chosŏn Sports Association. It details the participating teams from elementary, middle school, and youth divisions across Korea, including prominent schools like Hwimun, Paejae, Posŏng, Yŏnhŭi, and Sungsil. The reporter describes the matches day-by-day, noting disruptions due to rain and poor court conditions, which hindered player performance. Key results include Sŏnch'ŏn Public Primary winning the elementary division, Hwimun Higher Common School winning the middle school division, and Kŭmgang Tennis Club winning the youth division for the third consecutive year, thus permanently keeping the championship flag. The article concludes by observing a marked improvement in sportsmanship among both players and spectators compared to previous years, emphasizing fair play over mere victory.

From a historical perspective, the article is interesting as it showcases the burgeoning organized sports scene in colonial Korea, specifically tennis, involving various educational institutions and regional youth groups from across the peninsula. It highlights the participation structure (elementary, middle, youth divisions) and the geographical reach (from Sŏnch'ŏn in the north to Sunch'ŏn, though less far south). The mention of logistical problems like weather and court conditions, alongside the explicit commentary on the improved "spirit of sportsmanship" and understanding of "fighting well and competing fairly" (善戰善鬪), offers insight into the development and perception of modern sports culture during this period, potentially reflecting broader social changes and nationalist undertones associated with physical culture under Japanese rule.

정구대회, 정구대회, 全朝鮮 정구대회. 이것이 일년에 한 차레식 열니는 朝鮮体育會 주최로 왼 朝鮮 천지애 배달 자손들이 각각 자기 향토의 우월한 選手들을 뽑아서 출전케 하는 뜻 깁고 이로움 만흔 큰 모힘이다. 이번 대회는 第4回인바 日就月將의 형세로 한거름 두거름 발전의 길을 밟어나가서 금번에는 括目할 성황을 일우엇다. 참가단체 수도 만헛거니와 그 중에도 지방단체들이 만히 참가되엿스며 더욱이 이채를 띄운 것은 小學團의 어린 선수들이 참가한 것이다.
참가단체를 點考하면, 먼 곳으로부터 따저서 宣川公普의 小學團, 順天지방청년회의 靑年團, 咸興運動部의 靑年團, 平壤崇實大學의 靑年團, 鎭南浦公普의 小學단, 平壤光成高普의 中學團, 元山청년회의 靑年團, 開城南門*法청년회의 靑年團, 開城松普의 中學團, 開城第一第二普敎의 小學團, 서울로 처서 同을徽文의 靑年團, 同講習生의 靑年團, 金剛庭球部의 靑年團, 法學專門의 靑年團, 延禧專門의 靑年團, 普成專門의 靑年團, 徽文高普의 中學團, 培材高普의 中學團, 養正高普의 中學團, 東光高普의 中學團, 仁川公普의 小學團, 普成初等의 小學團 등이다.
본래 작정하기는 오전 八時에 입장식을 거행하고 뒤미처 경기를 시작하기로 하엿든 것인대 그 전날 밤의 뜻박게 폭우와 당일 아침의 변덕스러운 日氣로 말미암어 9時 30分頃에 입장식과 우승기 반환식을 거행하고 十時頃이나 되여서 小學團의 예선경기로부터 개회되엿다. 첫재로 鎭南浦公普와 開城普敎의 대전이 시작되야, 鎭南浦가 승리를 하고 開城普敎가 패배한 후 宣川公普와 開城普敎가 相戰해서 역시 開城이 敗北하고, 나서는, 일승자인 鎭南浦公普와 宣川公普와, 不戰一勝者인 仁川公普와 普成初等이 抽籤을 한 결과 第2回 예선전으로 普成初等과 仁川公普가 대전을 해서 仁川公報가 백기를 들고 普初가 승전을 하엿스며 다음에 鎭南浦대 宣川의 격전이 개시되야 鎭南浦가 패하고 물너나가니 小學團의 예선전은 끗을 마치엿다. 다음에 中學團의 경기가 계속되야 첫재로 養正高普와 東光高普의 경쟁이 시작되야 養正이 승리를 하고 東光이 敗北한 뒤에 徽高 培材의 격전이 열니엿섯는 바 培材가 무참히 패하고 徽文이 대승을 한 후 徽文, 養正 두 一勝者와 松高, 光成 두 不戰勝者 등의 相對抽籤을 한 결과 첫재로 徽文과 松高의 相戰이 시작되엿다. 그러나 가을날 짤은 해빗은 점점 붉어지기를 시작하는 까닭에 심판은 날이 졈으러 못하게 되면 「껨」의 계산을 그대로 두고 明朝로 밀우겟다는 선전을 한 후 경기가 시작되엿다. 이 두 「템」의 경쟁은 금번의 그 중 흥미 잇는 경기이엇섯다. 徽文에서는 잇해 동안을 松高로 더부러 격전하야 분하게 패한 한을 품고 잇스며, 松高에서는 금번까지만 승리를 하면 3年간 우승의 표적으로 우승기를 영구히 갓게될 것이다. 그럼으로 두 팀의 경기는 白熱戰이엇섯다. 양편 첫재 패가 장시간의 猛戰을 한 결과 松高의 첫패가 꺽기인 후 날이 점으러서 남어지 껨은 다음 날로 밀우고 당일은 폐회를 하엿다. (15日記)
그러나 당일의 경쟁은 크게 유감되는 일이 잇섯섯다. 그는 「코트」가 불완전해서 선수들의 경기의 큰 거리낌이 된 것이엇섯다. 그 전날 밤의 폭우로 말미얌어 「새로」만든 「코트」가 骨沒한 사람들의 專工이 可惜하게, 진쿠렁이 되고 말엇스며 당일은 햇발을 별로 볼 수가 업섯든＜100＞ 까닭에 폐회할 때까지도 물긔가 그대로 남어잇고 질쳑거리여서 선수마다 각각 자기 기능을 충분히 자랑하지 못한 것이 큰 유감이엇섯다.
오늘은 제 2일이다. 어제 생각하기는 오날 아침에은 「코트」가 굿으리라고 햇섯스나 오늘 아침에 도 별로 굿지를 못햇다. 하는 수 업시 오전까지는 徽文에서 만들어 노흔 동편운동장에 잇는 「코트」를 쓰기로 하야 오전 9時부터 옹색하나마 不得己 경기 개시를 하엿다. 나는 불행히 「코트」관리의 책임을 맛흔 까닭에 오전중의 경기는 보지 못하는 고로 자세한 것을 아지 못한다. 그러나 엿덧든지 松高는 徽文의 대장패를 남긴대로, 부장패에게 무참하게 패하고 말엇스며, 光成高普는 養正高普에게 패하고 中學團의 예선전이 끗낫스며 계속하야 靑年團의 예선경쟁이 개시되야 첫재로 延禧와 徽文講習이 싸와서 徽講이 승리를 하고 다음예 普成專門대 金剛의 싸홈이 잇섯는데 普成專門이 참패를 하엿다 한다. 다음에는 새로 만든 「코트」의 수리가 끗난는 고로 대운동장으로 옴겨가지고 오후 1時30分頃부터 경기가 계속되엿다. 元山靑年대 開城靑年의 싸홈이 시작되엇는 바, 이는 매 격전이엿섯다. 드대여 開城이 敗北하고 元山이 익이엇다. 이에 第1回 예선전은 끗이나고 일승자인 金剛, 徽講, 元山등 단체와 不戰勝者인 咸興運動部, 全徽文, 順川靑年, 法學專門, 崇實大學, 등 5단체가 합해가지고 第2回 예선전 상대추첨이 잇섯는 바, 첫재 咸興대 徽講이 싸호게 되야 徽講이 무참히 패하엿스며 둘재로 全徽文대 元山청년의 相戰이 잇섯는바 元山청년이 패전하얏스며 다음예 順川청년대 金剛의 相戰이 잇섯는바 金剛이 대승을 하얏다. 날이 임의 졈으러서 끗을 맛치고 다음날 게속하기로 하엿다. 17日 아침에 계속 되여다. 崇實대  法專의 싸홈은 法專이 대승하고, 다음에 第3回 예선전이 개시되야 咸興과 金剛이 싸워서 金剛이 승리하고 法專대 올徽文의 경쟁이 시작되엿는바 이 싸홈은 실로 白熱戰이엇섯다. 을徽文의 첫패가 法專의 두패를 꺽거 눌으고 優退를 한 후, 法專의 대장패가 난와서 올徽文의 부장패와 대장패를 뭇질은 후, 올徽文의 優退패로 더부러 一勝一負의 형세로 간신히 마져 격퇴하고 法專이 기어코 승리를 하엿다.
이제 예선은 모다 끗나고 小學團으로부터 결승이 개시되엿는 바 결승전은 별로 滋味가 업섯다. 宣川公普대 普成初等의 사홈은 猛虎와 개의 싸홈을 보는 것 갓흔 감이 젹지 안은 중 宣川의 대장패는 出戰도 하지 못하고 대승을 하엿스며, 中學團의 徽文高普와 養正高普의 상전도 역시 徽文의 대장패는 출전도 하지 안어서 養正이 참패를 하엿다. 다음에 청년단의 法專대 金剛의 결승전은 양편의 대장패들은 다갓치 출전도 해보앗스며 또는 金剛의 부장패를 꺽거 눌으기도 해보앗스나 결국은 역시 法專이 참패를 하엿다.
이와갓치 경기의 끗을 막고 영예의 우승기와 상품 수여식이 잇섯는 바, 그 중 청년단 우승자인 金剛庭球部는 금번째 3回를 계속하야 우승을 한 까닭에 우승기는 영원히 차지하게 되엿다.
그런대 그 세 團의 戰跡으로 도라볼진대, 小學團의 技能은 開城普校生이 매우 일매졋스며 기능도 상당하엿섯다고 생각한다. 宣川 鎭南浦公普생들은 지방이라 입학연령이 달은 까닭에 나 만코 큰 사람들이엿든 것은 엇지 할 수 업는 일이지만은 개성이나 서울 小學生들과 적수가 되지 안는 것이 젹은 어린이들에게 대하야 미안한 일이엇섯다. 그리고 中學團의 徽文高普軍과 청년단의 金剛庭球部는 다른 템보다 확실히 굿센 것을 알 수가 잇섯다.
어졔 선수나 일반관중의 태도를 볼진대 일반이 모다 정중해졋다. 재작년보다 작년이 낫고 작년보다 금년이 몃 배나 운동정신이 보급되엿다. 선수의 정신이 冷靜해 젓스며 관중의 태도가 정중해져서 운동경기는 그 정신이 勝癖에만 잇는 것이 안이요 善戰善鬪함에 잇다는 것을 완전히 이해하게 된 모양이다.＜101＞
