**Summary**

This company notice from the magazine *Kaebyŏk* announces several personnel changes and organizational updates in November 1923. It reports the dismissal of the Kanggye branch manager, the appointment of a new manager for the Chinju branch, the creation of a new outpost in Nyŏngbyŏn with appointed staff, and the establishment of an entirely new branch, the Kwandong Branch, located in Ch'ŏrwŏn, along with a list of its officers. For historians, this notice provides concrete evidence of the organizational structure and expansion efforts of a significant Korean cultural magazine during the Japanese colonial period. It reveals the names of individuals involved in regional intellectual and publishing networks, the geographical reach of the magazine (Kanggye, Chinju, Nyŏngbyŏn, Ch'ŏrwŏn), and the formal structure (roles like Branch Manager, General Manager, Advisor, Reporter, External Affairs) adopted by such Korean enterprises at the time.
