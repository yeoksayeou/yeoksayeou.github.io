Magazine Title: 개벽 제41호

Article Title: 鏡城 朱乙溫에서 (From Kyŏngsŏng [and] Chuŭl-on)
Author: 朴春坡
Article Type: 소식 (News/Letter)

(Omitted beginning) North Korea (北鮮), perhaps because it's the North, seems particularly desolate, making Ch'unp'a (春波) feel desolate as well. Kŭnp'a-kun (槿坡君) is still undergoing hardship with me (同苦 中), but the future is uncertain (未定).

Now, I plan to tour Ch'ŏngjin (淸津), Puryŏng (富寧), Hoeryŏng (會寧), Yongjŏng (龍井), Kukchaga (局子街), Onsŏng (穩城), Kyŏngwŏn (慶源), and Kyŏnghŭng (慶興), then proceed to Unggi (雄基). From there, by boat (船便), and then again via the Ch'ŏngŭl Railway (淸乙鐵道), I will finish at Myŏngch'ŏn (明川), Kilchu (吉州), and Sŏngjin (城津). From Sŏngjin, I plan to go up to Seoul (上京) by boat (船便). This will likely take about one and a half months (略 1個月半).

Soch'un-hyŏng (小春兄), there is a need to expand the local correspondence section (地方通信欄) a bit. How do the local readers welcome it? The "Letter from North Korea" (「北鮮來信」) in the October issue has become a big topic of discussion (큰 문제 거리) in this region. (Omitted ending).

**Summary**

The author, Pak Ch'unp'a, writes from the Kyŏngsŏng/Chuŭl-on area, describing the desolate feeling of northern Korea (Puksŏn). He details an extensive upcoming travel itinerary covering numerous towns in northern Hamgyong province (Ch'ŏngjin, Hoeryŏng, Onsŏng, Unggi, Sŏngjin etc.) as well as Korean-populated areas in Manchuria (Yongjŏng, Kukchaga), anticipating the journey to take about a month and a half, involving travel by train and boat, ultimately heading back to Seoul. He also addresses a colleague ("Soch'un-hyŏng"), suggesting the expansion of the magazine's local correspondence section and noting that a previous article about North Korea sparked significant local interest.

For historians, this article offers valuable insights into travel networks (railways like the mysterious "Ch'ŏngŭl Railway," boats) and the perceived atmosphere ("desolate") in northern Korea during the colonial period (1923). It highlights Korean presence and activity in Manchuria (Jiandao region: Yongjŏng, Kukchaga). Furthermore, it sheds light on the editorial practices and reader engagement of influential magazines like *Kaebyŏk*, showing the importance placed on local news and the impact such reporting could have in the regions discussed.
