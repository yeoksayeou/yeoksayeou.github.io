New News, New Trends......Part 2 - The Newly Rising Japanese Proletarian Party

The issue of the Japanese Proletarian Party, which arose concurrently with the passage of the Universal Suffrage Bill (普選法案) this spring, reached a consensus among participating organizations on the platform, regulations, and other points at the 2nd Investigation Committee held in Ōsaka in mid-October. A grand party formation ceremony is set to be held in Tōkyō on December 1st. There are over 30 participating organizations, representing approximately 500,000 organized workers (besides this, there is support from the entire membership of the Japan Farmers' Union), who will become party members. Furthermore, Abe Isoo (安部磯雄) is considered the leading candidate for Central Executive Committee Chairman, equivalent to the president of established political parties. The principles and platform upheld by the party represent the utmost radicalism publishable under current Japanese law, to the extent that the Imperial Household Ministry (宮內省) once inquired with the Privy Council (樞密院) about the suspicion of undermining the national polity (國體破壞). The draft platform is as follows:

Male Students Becoming Ideologues
Originating from the anti-military research movement at Waseda University (早稻田大學), the All-Japan Student Scientific Research Association, centered on the study of Socialism and Communism, previously recognized as an academic research group, has become involved in actual movements. Due to this fact, the Tōkyō Metropolitan Police Department (경시청) is said to have started cracking down on students as ideologues (主義者) since yesterday. The ideologue-ization of Japanese students—isn't this also one noteworthy current phenomenon?

Ideological Trends of Japanese Female Students
The Japanese Ministry of Education (文部省) held a National Higher Girls' School Principals' Conference for three days starting October 5th, discussing various matters. Among them, regarding (1) Matters requiring special consideration concerning the recent ideological trends of higher girls' school students, because discussions have been rampant lately about female students' thoughts being this or that, the authorities strictly prohibited newspaper and magazine reporters from observing and revised countermeasures against it. Subsidiary agenda items included (1) The pros and cons of co-education and its scope, (2) What to do about women's religious sentiment? (3) The pros and cons of sex education, etc. <42>

Nationwide Student Anti-Military Education Movement
Over ten members of the Anti-Military Education Movement Committee representing students nationwide visited the Ministry of Education authorities on October 2nd and delivered a resolution regarding the military education issue at Otaru Higher Commercial School (小樽高商).

Joint Declaration of the Anti-Military Education Movement
The newspaper societies of three universities, Japan Imperial University (日本帝國大學), Waseda University (早稻田大學), and Rikkyō University (立敎大學), issued a joint declaration actively opposing the military education being implemented in Japanese schools. Its main points are:
If schools are militarized, and thus willingly submit to the manipulation of the military cliques, the mission of the university will be completely trampled, and at the same time, the freedom for independent academic research will forever lose its trace.

Ministry of Education's Countermeasure Study
As student ideology has recently shown a tendency to gradually lean leftward (左傾), the Ministry of Education (文部省) has taken notice. To make the content of middle school law and economics textbooks more moderate and steady, it has commissioned Minobe Tatsukichi (美濃部達吉), Nakajima Tamakichi (中島玉吉), Kōbe Masao (神戶正雄), Yamazaki Kakujirō (山崎覺次郞), and other experts to devise new plans. These are scheduled to be submitted to the Higher School Law and Economics Professors' Meeting around the 20th of this month, where the method of handling current affairs issues is expected to be an important point of discussion.

Frequent Visits Between Japanese and Russian Laborers
It is still fresh in our memory that when the Russian labor delegation came to Japan last month, 30,000 Japanese laborers welcomed them at Tōkyō Station. As a return gesture from the Japanese labor side, three individuals—Mr. Motozawa Kenji (本澤兼治) and one other from the Tōkyō Joint Labor Union, and Mr. Sasaki Takashi (佐佐木節), an executive of the Japan Labor Union—are said to have slipped through the authorities' surveillance network and entered Russia (露西亞). It seems they are getting along quite well.

Nationalist Faction (國粹派) Plans Founding Festival
Taking the opportunity of the National Foundation Day (紀元節) next February, the faction of Toyama Mitsuru (頭山滿), known as Japanese nationalist (國粹的) rōnin, plans to hold a nationwide Founding Festival (建國祭) to evoke the national essence (國粹) of Great Japan.

Capital Interest Tax to be Newly Imposed
The Japanese government, while discussing tax system reorganization, seems intent on imposing a new type of tax called "Capital Interest Tax" (資本利子稅). This tax is intended to be levied anew on public bonds (national bonds, local bonds, corporate bonds) and deposits (bank deposits). The reason given is that since there is already a land tax on land, a business tax on business, and a house tax on houses, there cannot but be some special tax on public bonds <43>. The tax rate is expected to be 2 percent (100分의 2).

Non-Austere Budget for the Next Fiscal Year
Japan's budget for the next fiscal year has been confirmed at a total of 1,598,230,000 yen. Broken down by ministry, the Imperial Household費 is 4.5 million yen, Foreign Affairs is over 18.1 million yen, Home Affairs is over 239 million yen, Finance is over 338.7 million yen, Army is over 199.8 million yen, Navy is over 239 million yen, Justice is over 32.4 million yen, Education is over 123.5 million yen, Agriculture and Forestry is over 44.9 million yen, Commerce and Industry is over 22.1 million yen, and Communications is over 346 million yen. Compared to this year's total budget of 1,549,810,000 yen, this is an increase of 48.42 million yen. Subsidies for the colonies remain the same as this year: 15,123,000 yen for Chosŏn (朝鮮), 3 million yen for the Kwantung Leased Territory (關東州), 600,000 yen for Karafuto (樺太), and 1.8 million yen for the South Seas Mandate (南洋廳), totaling 20,523,000 yen. In other words, while chanting austerity, austerity, they have established all the plans they wanted to, including the Navy Ministry's supplementary vessel construction costs and the Ministry of Education's youth military education expenses.

The Current Government as Seen by the Political Friends Association (政友會)
The Political Friends Association (政友會), which had formed a coalition cabinet with the Constitutional Association (憲政會) but was eventually kicked out, held a Seiyūkai Central Convention on the 14th of last month. After making declarations and resolutions, President Tanaka (田中) gave his usual speech on industrial nation-building (産業立國). Here are points 2 and 3 of their resolutions:
1. To strive for the overthrow (倒壞) of the current cabinet, which bows its head (叩頭) to the House of Peers, flatters (阿諛) the financial cliques (財閥), avoids dissolution [of the Diet], obstructs the immediate implementation of universal suffrage, and practices plutocracy (金權政治) (Editor's Note: especially backed by the Mitsubishi (三菱) kingdom).
2. To pursue the policy of industrial nation-building (産業立國), including the promotion of commerce and industry and the development of trade.
3. To strive for the establishment of peace in the East by making relations with China (對支) and Russia (對露) even closer.
5. To establish a colonial migration policy and strive for the overseas expansion of the nation's people.
7. To reorganize the tax system, abolish land tax and business tax from national taxes, aim for burden reduction, and simultaneously cultivate the roots (根蔕) of self-government.
8. To unite efforts for the realization of social policy.
9. To revise the current system and ensure that the enactment of educational laws and regulations requires the cooperation (協贊) of the Diet.
12. To strive for the replenishment of new weapons through the application of science and the completion of industrial mobilization plans. <44>

**Summary**

This article from the December 1925 issue of *Kaebyŏk* reports on the imminent formation of the Japanese Proletarian Party (Nihon Musan Seitō), detailing its extensive and radical platform aimed at establishing broad democratic rights, social welfare, worker and farmer protections, military and educational reforms, and an anti-imperialist foreign policy. It covers universal suffrage for adults over 18, abolition of elite institutions, repeal of repressive laws, land nationalization, and support for colonial self-determination and weaker nations. The article also notes related social trends: growing leftist ideology among students, leading to anti-military education movements and government countermeasures; increased interaction between Japanese and Soviet labor movements; nationalist reactions; government budget increases despite austerity talk; and political maneuvering by the opposition Seiyūkai party against the ruling cabinet. From the perspective of Korean colonial history, the Proletarian Party's platform points demanding "Self-determination for colonial self-governing systems" and the "Repeal of unequal treaties regarding weak nations (弱小民族) and all other imperialistic oppressions" are particularly noteworthy. Historians might find this article interesting for its detailed documentation of a significant left-wing political movement in Imperial Japan, its specific policy proposals (including those related to colonies), and the broader social and political context of mid-1920s Japan, which directly impacted colonial Korea.

男學生들의 主義者化
早稻田大學의 反軍事硏究運動에 端을 發하야 종래 學術硏究團體로 인정되던 社會主義 乃至 共産主義의 연구를 중심으로 한 日本全國學生科學硏究會는 단순한 연구뿐만 아니라 實際運動에까지 관련하는 사실을 인하야 東京의 경시청은 어제로부터는 학생에 대하야도 主義者로 取締하게 되얏다한다. 日本學生들의 主義者化, 이 亦 注意의 現狀 하나가 아닐가.

日本女學生들의 思想傾向
日本文部省에서는 10月 5日부터 3日間 全國高等女學校長會議를 열고 여러 가지 일을 니야기 한 中,
(一)高等女學校生徒 近時의 思想傾向에 관하야 특히 고려할 사항 如何에 관하야는 최근 女學生의 사상이 이러니 저러니하야 의론이 百出한 故로 당국에서는 新聞雜誌記者의 방청을 엄금하고 그에 대한 取締策을 개정하엿는데 그러한 議題 中의 지엽에는 (一)男女共學의 可否及其範圍如何, (二)女子의 宗敎心을 如何히 하랴? (三)性敎育의 可否 等도 잇섯다 한다. ＜42＞

全國學生의 反軍敎運動
全國學生을 代表한 軍敎反對運動委員 十數名은 10月 2日 文部 當局을 방하고 小樽高商의 軍敎問題에 대한 결의문을 交附하엿다.

反軍敎運動의 共同宣言
日本帝國大學, 早稻田大學, 立敎大學의 3大學 新聞學會에서는, 이번 日本各學校에 實施되는 軍事敎育에 대하야, 적극적으로 반대한다는 共同宣言을 발포하엿는데, 그 要意를 보면
학교를 병영화하여, 그리하야 軍閥의 驅使에 甘從한다 하면 大學의 사명은 완전히 유린되  는 同時에 學問의 獨立硏究에 대한 자유는 영원히 자취를 힐으리라.

文部省의 對策講究
右와 가티 近來 學生의 思想이 漸漸 左傾되야가는 傾向이 잇슴으로 文部省에서는 여긔에 留意하야 가지고 中等學校法制 經濟敎科書의 내용을 일층 온건 착실하게 하기 위하야 美濃部達吉, 中島玉吉, 神戶正雄, 山崎覺次郞, 기타 諸大家에게 新案을 세우게 하야 來 20日頃에 高等學校法經擔富敎授會에 附議하기로 되얏다는데 時事問題取扱法은 論議의 重要件이 되리라한다.

往來가 자즌 日露의 勞働者
月前 露西亞勞働代表가 日本에 왓섯슬때, 3만名의 日本人 勞働者가 그를 東京驛까지 出迎하엿다함은 우리의 기억이 尙新한 바어니와 日本 勞働者側에서는 이에 대한 返禮로 東京合同勞動組合員 本澤兼治氏外 1名과 日本勞働組合幹部 佐佐木節氏의 3人이 當局의 鏡戒網을 버서 露西亞로 드러갓다고. 꽤들 새가 됴케지내는 모양이지.

國粹派는 建國祭를 設行
明年 2月의 紀元節을 기하야, 日本의 國粹的 浪人으로 지목되는 頭山滿一派는 大日本의 國粹를 환기키 위하야 全國的으로 建國祭를 設行할 계획이라 한다.

새로 賦課될 資本利子稅
日本政府에서는 이번 稅務整理를 운운하는 동시에 「資本利子稅」라는 일종의 新稅를 課하려는 樣인데 이 세는 새로 公債(國債, 地方債, 社債)나 預金(銀行預金)에 과세코져하는 것이다. 그 이유는 旣히 토지에는 地租, 영업에 營業稅, 가옥에는 家屋稅가 잇는 이상, 公價에＜43＞ 대해서는 何等의 特別稅가 업슬 수 업스리라는 것인데, 稅率은 100分의 2가 되리라고.

不緊縮의 明年度豫算
日本의 明年度 예산은 總額 15억9,823만圓으로 확정되엿는대 이를 省別로 보면 皇室費가 450만圓, 外務가 1,810여만圓, 內務가 2억3,900여만圓, 大藏이 3억3,870여만圓, 陸軍이 1억9,980여만圓, 海軍이 2억3,900여만圓, 司法이 3,240여만圓, 文部가 1억2,350여만萬圓, 農林이 4,490여만圓, 商工이 2,210여만圓, 遞信이 3억4,600여만圓인 바 금년도의 豫算總額 15억4,981만圓에 비하야 4,842만圓이 증가되엇스며, 植民地補給金은 본년도와 가티 朝鮮에 1,512만3천圓, 關東州에 300만圓, 樺太에 60만圓, 南洋廳에 180만圓 計2,052만3천圓이다. 말하자면 긴축 긴축하면셔 海軍省의 補助艦新設費와 文部省의 靑少年軍事敎育費를 위시하야, 자기하고 십흔 계획은 다-세운 것이다.

政友會가 본 現政府
憲政會와 가티 聯立內閣을 조직햇다가 그만 쫏기여나오고 말은 政友會에서는 지난달 14日, 政友中央大會를 열고, 선언, 결의를 행한 후, 田中總裁의 例의 産業立國에 대한 연설이 잇섯는대, 이제 그 결의의 2,3을 소개하면
