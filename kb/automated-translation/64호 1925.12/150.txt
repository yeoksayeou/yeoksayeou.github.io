Imsil Brief Record
Yi Sŏk-yong (李錫庸), a man from Imsil (任實), was magnanimous and upright, possessing the spirit and integrity of a true man. He was also skilled in poetry and prose. In the Eulsa year (乙巳, 1905), he raised a righteous army and operated widely throughout the Honam (湖南) region. Later, he fought disadvantageously against Japanese soldiers (日兵). Saying to himself that failing to achieve great merit while wrongly killing people was also not righteous, he disbanded his army and returned to the mountains. Afterwards, he raised troops again and, after repeated fierce battles, was finally defeated and captured. He subsequently died in Taegu (大邱) prison (at the age of 38). Three of his poems are introduced as follows:

In Honam, the fourth month, pear blossoms fly,
A scholar serving his country takes off his iron armor.
Even the mountain birds seem to know the times are gone,
All night they urge me, "Better to return home." (Composed when disbanding the army)

Firm sincerity pierces the universe,
Majestic righteous spirit fills mountains and rivers.
You onlookers filling the city, do not laugh,
A patriot's glory is abundant this day. (Composed when captured and entering Chŏnju (全州))

Arriving at Wansan (完山), my parents' hometown,
There is no road from which to gaze upon my old home.
In prison, there is only an east-west gap,
Through which the light of the Korean sky's (韓天) sun and moon filters in. (Composed in Chŏnju prison)
<84>

**Summary**

This article briefly recounts the life of Yi Sŏk-yong, a righteous army leader from Imsil who fought against Japanese forces after 1905. Initially disbanding his troops out of concern for civilian casualties, he later resumed fighting, was captured, and died in Taegu prison at age 38. The article includes three poems written by Yi: one upon disbanding his army, another upon being paraded through Chŏnju after capture, and a third while imprisoned in Chŏnju, reflecting his patriotism and sorrow. For historians, this piece is valuable as it documents the activities and fate of a specific righteous army leader, illustrating the personal sacrifices made during the anti-Japanese resistance. The inclusion of Yi's poems provides a poignant, first-hand glimpse into the motivations, despair, and enduring patriotism of those involved in the armed struggle during the Korean colonial period.
