扶安邑
						李奎報
一春三過此江頭, 王事何會怨末休.
萬里壯濤奔白馬, 千年老木風蒼風
海風吹落*村笛, 沙月來迎浦客舟.
擁去騶童應怪我, 每逢佳景立遲留.＜33＞

Puan Town
						Yi Kyubo
In one spring, I pass this riverbank three times;
How could I complain that royal duties never cease?
Ten thousand leagues of grand waves rush like white horses,
Thousand-year-old trees stand in the vast wind.
The sea breeze blows down the sound of the village flute*,
The moon over the sands comes to greet the traveler's boat at the inlet.
The groom leading my horse away must think me strange,
Every time I meet fine scenery, I stand and linger long. <33>

**Summary**

This poem, attributed to the Goryeo dynasty poet Yi Kyubo (李奎報), describes the author's travels through Puan (扶安邑) while engaged in official duties (王事). Despite the demanding nature of his work, requiring him to pass the same spot multiple times, he pauses to appreciate the powerful natural scenery: turbulent waves, ancient trees, the sea wind carrying flute sounds, and moonlight on the water. He acknowledges that his lingering might seem odd to his attendant but cannot help himself when faced with beautiful landscapes. The publication of this classical poem in *Kaebyŏk* (개벽), a prominent Korean nationalist magazine during the colonial period, is significant. It represents an effort to celebrate and preserve Korean cultural and literary heritage, implicitly asserting national identity against Japanese assimilation policies by showcasing the enduring artistic achievements of historical Korean figures.
