Gwanghallu Pavilion
						Kang Hŭimeng
Known far and wide in the Southern Country is Gwanghallu Pavilion,
In the sixth month, ascending it, my bones feel the chill of autumn.
The shadow of the cassia tree suddenly arrives, the celestial sphere is tranquil,
The red railing passes by the Cowherd star (Altair).<33>

**Summary**

This article presents a classical Chinese poem titled "Gwanghallu" by the early Joseon scholar-official Kang Hŭimeng (1418-1481). The poem praises the beauty and atmosphere of Gwanghallu Pavilion in Namwon, evoking a sense of cool tranquility even in summer and connecting the earthly pavilion with celestial imagery like the moon (implied by the cassia tree) and stars (Altair). The republication of this classic poem in a 1925 issue of *Kaebyŏk* magazine during the Japanese colonial period is significant. It reflects a continued appreciation for and assertion of traditional Korean literary heritage (written in Hanmun) amidst colonial pressures and burgeoning modernity. Historians might find it interesting as an example of cultural continuity and subtle nationalism expressed through reverence for classical literature and famous Korean landmarks.
