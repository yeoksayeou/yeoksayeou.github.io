Article Title: 獒樹驛의 유래 (The Origin of Osu Station)
Author: Unknown (implied by Article Type)
Article Type: 잡저 (Miscellaneous Writing)

On the thoroughfare connecting Imsil and Namwŏn, there is Osu Station (獒樹驛) (Currently Imsil County - original text). Though its date is unknown, there was a man from Kŏnyŏng (居寧) county (Old name for Imsil - original text) named Kim Kaein (金盖仁) who had a beloved dog. One day, after going to the market, he became drunk and fell asleep on the way home. Just then, a wildfire approached, and Kaein was on the verge (還) of burning to death. His dog went to the stream, fetched water with its tail fur (尾毛), and prevented the fire, but died from exhaustion. After Kaein awoke and learned the facts, he was moved by the dog's righteousness (義), gave it a lavish burial, and planted his staff (杖) there as a marker. Strangely, buds and leaves (芽葉) grew from the staff, and thus it was named Osu (獒樹 - Mastiff Tree). From then on, the station there was also named Osu Station (獒樹驛). In Sŏ Saga's (徐四佳) poem about the Yŏnjallu (鷰子樓) Pavilion in Sunch'ŏn (順天), the line "Beyond Ch'agwŏllyŏng (鵲兒嶺), a single Osu (一獒樹)" refers precisely to this. (There is currently a monument; the story is the same as the Righteous Dog Mound (義狗塚) of Sŏnsan (善山)). ＜73＞

**Summary**

This article recounts the legend behind the name of Osu Station (Osuyŏk), located between Imsil and Namwŏn. A man named Kim Kaein was saved from a wildfire by his loyal dog, which repeatedly soaked its tail in a stream to douse the flames around its drunken master, eventually dying of exhaustion. In gratitude, Kim Kaein buried the dog and planted his staff at the grave. The staff miraculously sprouted leaves, becoming the "Osu" (Mastiff Tree), which gave the area and the later station its name. The article notes a similar story exists in Sŏnsan, known as the Righteous Dog Mound. For historians, this piece is interesting as it documents local folklore and place name origins during the Japanese colonial period, reflecting the preservation of Korean cultural narratives. The comparison to a similar tale in Sŏnsan and the reference to a classical poem by Sŏ Kŏjŏng (Sŏ Saga) highlight the story's cultural resonance and potential roots in older traditions.
