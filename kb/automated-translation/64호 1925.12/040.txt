**Summary**

This article from the December 1925 issue of *Kaebyŏk* lists sixteen major events that occurred during the year Eulchuk (乙丑, 1925), presented chronologically from January to November. The events span international affairs (Soviet-Japan relations, Sun Yat-sen's death, China's turmoil, Locarno Pact, India's anti-British movement, Peking Tariff Conference), Japanese politics (Universal Suffrage, Peace Preservation Law, Katō Cabinet), and significant occurrences within colonial Korea (Chaeryŏng tenant dispute, Journalists' Conference, dissolution of activists' meeting, Kyŏngsŏng flood, arrival of Soviet Consul General, press suppression, and the suspension of *Kaebyŏk* magazine itself). The list provides a snapshot of the key political, social, and international developments perceived as most impactful during that year. For historians, the article is revealing in its selection of events, juxtaposing major international shifts with specific Korean socio-political developments and instances of colonial control like the Peace Preservation Law and press censorship targeting *Kaebyŏk*. This highlights the interconnectedness of global events and local colonial realities, as well as the growing social movements and state responses within 1920s Korea.
