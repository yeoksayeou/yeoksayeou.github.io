**Summary**

This entry provides only the metadata for an article titled "Timely Words" (時言) by Kim Kyŏngjae (金璟載), published in issue 64 of the magazine *Kaebyŏk* (개벽) on December 1, 1925. The entire body of the article is noted as having been removed by censors ("이하 검열삭제"). The complete censorship of an editorial piece starkly illustrates the strict control over expression and the press exercised by the Japanese Government-General during the colonial period in Korea. Historians would find this significant as direct evidence of censorship practices and the suppression of potentially critical viewpoints in prominent Korean intellectual magazines of the era.
