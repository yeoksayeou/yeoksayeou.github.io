Movement to Establish Vladivostok Middle School.

This Education Association plans to establish a Korean middle school in Vladivostok (海蔘威) and sought the sympathy of compatriots in the homeland. The Association President Kim Yŏnghak and executive Paek Sŏng'uk arrived in Kyŏngsŏng several days ago. (1st)

Ch'ŏndogyo's Heaven Day Commemoration Ceremony. As April 5th is the anniversary of the enlightenment of the religion's founder, Master Suun Sinsa, over 2,000 believers from Kyŏngsŏng and the provinces gathered at the Ch'ŏndogyo (天道敎) Headquarters for a grand commemorative ritual.

Ch'ŏndogyo Dispute. Within the Ch'ŏndogyo Church, there was some disagreement regarding the revision of the religious constitution, eventually leading to a dispute between two factions. To briefly summarize the details: the church revised its system at the end of last year in response to the changing times. Despite the righteousness of the revision<127> itself, the matter proceeded hastily, and the discussions and procedures involved somewhat lacked completeness, causing not only a lack of welcome from a portion [of members] but also several practical inconveniences in its actual operation. Taking the opportunity of the Heaven Day commemoration when many believers from Kyŏngsŏng and the provinces gathered, Mr. Son [Pyŏnghŭi] presented several revised clauses and ordered a second revision of the regulations. However, one faction considered or propagated this as an overturn of the new regulations, ultimately leading to a temporary dispute. But the vast majority of believers came to understand the situation over time, and the matter was largely resolved within a few weeks.

Declaration of War Between Wu and Zhang Armies. The situation in China is constantly turbulent. Now, opinions clash between the Zhili Army and the Fengtian Army, and Zhili warlord Wu Peifu (吳佩孚) has declared war on Fengtian warlord Zhang Zuolin (張作霖). (7th)

Tonggwang High Common School Expansion. Tonggwang High Common School (東光高普校), established through the joint efforts of 30 main Buddhist temples, had faced a significant crisis due to separation issues among the main temples. Now, with cooperative funding from 10 main temples including Pŏmŏsa, T'ongdosa, and Haeinsa, it is reported to be expanding successfully again.

Hyŏpsŏng School Opens.

**Summary**

This April 1922 social diary from "Kaebyŏk" magazine chronicles a wide range of events in Korea and involving Koreans abroad. It covers political violence (attack on General Tanaka in Shanghai), organizational activities (youth, labor, student aid groups), educational developments (Tokyo graduates, Vladivostok school plan, school reopening/expansion, entrance exam relief), international affairs (Austrian Emperor's death, Indian Viceroy's resignation, US miners' strike, Genoa Conference, British Prince's visit), disasters (fires in Namdaemun and Iri, Imperial Hotel fire in Tokyo), cultural events (theater group founding, Vladivostok performers' arrival, Peace Expo controversy), religious matters (Ch'ŏndogyo and Taejonggyo ceremonies, Ch'ŏndogyo internal dispute, petition against Temple Ordinance), and the visit of the Korean Crown Prince Yi Un. The diary highlights the dynamic social, cultural, and early nationalist activities occurring within colonial Korea and among the diaspora, alongside significant international news. For historians, the article offers valuable snapshots of Korean civil society organizing (youth, labor, education, religion), diaspora activities (Shanghai, Vladivostok, Tokyo, Fengtian, Siberia), resistance against Japanese rule (Tanaka attack, Peace Expo protest), the challenges faced (entrance exams, fires, internal disputes), and the interactions with global events and figures (Sanger, Genoa Conference, British Prince), all noted cautiously under implied colonial censorship ("Political articles are still omitted").
