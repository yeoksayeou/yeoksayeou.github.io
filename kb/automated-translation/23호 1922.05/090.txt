Historical Consideration of Korean Art -
						Pak Chonghong
Section 2: Characteristics and Causes of Korean Art
As for its position in art history, the characteristics of Korean art are more than half inferred. Being the crystallization of East Asian art, it is known to be a synthesis in both ideals and techniques. He who summarizes the characteristics of East Asian art speaks of the characteristics of Korean art, and to deduce the characteristics of Korean art is to discuss the characteristics of East Asian art. Does East Asian art conceal the subtle charm of the sublime and tragic? The imagination of Korean art can be measured. Does Korean art emit the elegant resonance of splendor and clarity? The essence of East Asian art can be glimpsed.

First, Characteristics and Causes in Painting: The most distinctive characteristics are expressed in painting. Indeed, it is difficult to critique according to the standards of today's aesthetics. That is, to understand the nature of East Asian painting, one must first understand what brushwork (筆法) is. The painters' golden rule, the so-called Six Laws (六法) by Xie He (謝赫) of Southern Qi, consists of:
First, Spirit Resonance/Vitality (氣運生動); Second, Bone Method/Use of the Brush (骨法用筆); Third, Correspondence to the Object/Depicting Form (應物像形); Fourth, Suitability to Type/Applying Color (隨類傳彩); Fifth, Division and Planning/Placement (經營位置); Sixth, Transmission by Copying/Modeling (傳摹移寫).
Following Spirit Resonance/Vitality, Bone Method/Use of the Brush is listed, and Correspondence to the Object/Depicting Form is placed below it. This clearly distinguishes it from Western painting, which prioritizes sketching from life (寫生). What Guo Ruoxu (郭若虛) of the Song dynasty called the three faults (三病) of painting can also be said to be entirely about the use of the brush.
First is "board-like" (板); when board-like, the wrist is weak and the brush clumsy, completely lacking give and take, rendering objects flat and partial, unable to be rounded and complete. Second is "carved" (刻); when carved, the brush movement halts midway, mind and hand are contrary; when facing the painting, sharp angles are arbitrarily produced. Third is "knotted" (結); when knotted, wanting to proceed but not proceeding, needing to disperse but not dispersing, resembling objects tied up, unable to flow smoothly.<1>
However, the first of the Six Laws is Spirit Resonance/Vitality (氣運生動). Since spirit resonance (氣運/氣韻) is based on the painter's innate talent and nature, it is said not to be something achievable through study. Wang Anjie (王安節) discussed this, saying:
"The five principles starting from Bone Method can be learned and accomplished, but Spirit Resonance must reside in innate knowledge (生知)."
Since the first-ranked Spirit Resonance thus resides in innate knowledge, those who study painting must necessarily practice Bone Method/Use of the Brush beforehand. This is likely why it is still considered their duty and most important task today.
That line (線條), which in Western painting merely expresses the outline and folds of objects, holds such a significant function likely stems from the concept of calligraphy and painting sharing the same body (書畵同軆). Yang Weizhen (揚維禎) said:
"Calligraphy and painting are one. Scholar-officials skilled in painting must be skilled in calligraphy; their painting method is inherent in their calligraphy method."
Only through the subtlety of brushwork (筆法之妙) can Spirit Resonance be brought to life. Xia Wenyan (夏文彦) stated:
"When Spirit Resonance/Vitality is achieved, it is called a divine work (神品); when brush and ink are transcendent, it is called a marvelous work (妙品); when form resembles rules and standards, it is called a capable work (能品)."
Things like resemblance to form (形似), coloring (設色), and composition/placement (經營 位置) merely serve to support the primary Spirit Resonance. This is not a universal rule; there are surely many painters among us who prioritize depicting form over brushwork. However, it is said that only after mastering the free use of the brush should one learn things like resemblance to form and application of color. The characteristic of East Asian painting truly lies here.
Therefore, a lack of realism (寫實法) is unavoidable. Anyone viewing an East Asian painting for the first time might comment that the painter lacks a single viewpoint for distance and perspective (near/far, high/low). Even if the coloring achieves an independent harmony, it is unnatural, and in depicting figures, there is a lack of individuality or personality expression, among other difficulties.
However, facing today, where Impressionism arose and Cubism emerged as new movements in new art, it is difficult to argue that there isn't a hidden concord with East Asian painting. Our art can indeed be called a kind of successful Impressionism (印象畵). Moreover, the cries of Futurism might even be said to surpass us. This correspondence between Eastern and Western art proves the similarity of aesthetic feeling (美感); how could only poets share the same mind? The great flaw of East Asian painting lies here, and its strength also lies here. It cannot be treated negligently; indeed, Spirit Resonance is its lifeblood.<2>

Second, General Artistic Characteristics and Causes: What gives rise to the endless charm produced by the imposing splendor of Buddhist temples (佛宇) and fortress pagodas (城塔), the architecture that birthed them, and the serene elegance of the carvings within and around them, corresponding with Buddhist paintings (佛畵) composed of brilliant colors? Next, I wish to explore their causes and discuss their ideal characteristics. The main causal factors are topography (地勢), climate (氣候), the temperament (氣質) of the people, local customs (風土), religion (宗敎), and politics (政治).

1. Topography, Climate, and People's Temperament: As a peninsula at the eastern end of the continent, backed by the Paektu mountain range (白頭山脈) in the north, the T'aebaek mountain range (太白山聯脈) runs south, forming the spinal range (脊梁山脈). The north, geographically separated from the Manchurian plain (滿洲平野), the homeland of the Paedal people (倍達族), possesses a bold artistic temperament born from this grand nature. It became a conduit for the cultures of Han and the Six Dynasties, leading the peninsular art world. The east coast has many steep cliffs and few indentations, thus lacking good harbors, so it's natural that civilization remained undeveloped. Although the tidal range is small, the narrow strip of land slopes steeply, and no large rivers flow into the sea. While Wŏnsan harbor (元山港) exists centrally, separated by the vast East Sea (日本海), transport was inconvenient. Furthermore, backed by high mountains, interaction with the Korean interior was extremely difficult. While it's true that good materials for art historical research are lacking, it's also a fact that our art assimilated the broad, unhindered characteristics of the Puyŏ people (扶餘族) who migrated south from the east. In contrast, the west coast lacks high mountain ranges, and long rivers like the Yalu (鴨綠江), Taedong (大洞江), and Han (漢江) flow into it, creating connected fertile plains (沃野) everywhere, convenient for water transport (水運) and suitable for agriculture. Like the ancient Indians by the Ganges (간지스), the Egyptians by the Nile (나일), and the Han Chinese along the Yellow River (黃河), culture greatly flourished. The coastline is rich in bays (灣入), and facing China (中國), its numerous good harbors facilitated frequent exchanges, receiving much influence from its civilization and goods. It is not difficult to imagine the brilliant art of today. The south has intricate rolling hills, possessing characteristics of warmth, grace, and brilliance. It once fused the northern martial spirit (武風), and its radiant influence (潤光) even reached Japan, separated by the sea to the southeast. However, attention should be paid to the art of the northwest. Just as the Gandhara (간다라) art of India combined India's inherent Buddhist designs (意匠) with Greek techniques (技巧) to create something transcendent, this Gandhara art, moving east and incorporating Tang styles, was further Koreanized, thereby establishing the crystallization of East Asian art. That its ruins <3> are dilapidated today is similar to Gandhara; it could be called the Gandhara region of Korea.
The climate, naturally related to the topography, being a region of extreme heat in summer and severe cold in winter, adds a spirit of perseverance and penetration to the people's temperament. Particularly, even in summer, rainfall is relatively low, and the air is dry. Combined with the extremes of heat and cold, rain and drought, this imparts distinct characteristics to housing, clothing, and other aspects of daily life.
Because we customarily sit on the floor even today, high ceilings (天井) were unnecessary in house construction. To defend against the cold, there are small, low structures of the ondol type (溫突式), partitioned by thick walls (墻壁). There are also tall pavilions (高樓巨閣) with windows opening on all four sides, allowing cool breezes to circulate naturally on hot summer days. There is men's clothing with sleeves (筒袂) similar to Western suits, fitting the body, and women's clothing (衣裳) with truly artistically crafted wide widths (寬幅).
As described above, regardless of the era, the surrounding environment shaped the characteristics of Korean art. With the arrival of Buddhism, much influence was received from China and India, awakening our innate, broad, profound continental spirit (大陸 氣風). The spirit of nature's majesty and solemnity – vast deserts (沙漠), perilous high peaks (高嶺), dense forests (森林), expansive plains (原野) – exists within us and should be sought in our artworks. While there was undoubtedly imitation of foreign styles, this merely served to allow the expression of the artistic nature latent within us, as it was all Koreanized. Also, neighboring island nations across the East Sea, their influence of refined taste (雅趣) – elegant, cheerful, delicate, etc. – was also not insignificant.
Alas, our ancestors were indeed great and beautiful. They freely expressed their innately possessed artistic nature to their heart's content in their artworks.

2. Local Customs (風土): Local customs have a crucial relationship in supplying materials for art. Although Korea today lacks forests, making it difficult to obtain good timber for house construction, considering the sandalwood (檀木) and pine (松材) from the Nangnim mountain range to the Yalu River border, one can know it wasn't originally so. Seeing that sandalwood (沈檀) was well-used in sculpture also helps understand the situation. For our architecture, still not free from its wood-based foundation (木造 本位), <4> the inconvenience of acquiring materials, as is our current situation today, makes it difficult to expect development.
Next, Korea geologically belongs to the so-called Paleozoic era strata, rich in gneiss (片麻巖) and granite (花崗巖). Because changes in strata are infrequent, the people's temperament exhibits a characteristic of leisurely immovability. In terms of art materials, these stone types (石材) are abundant and of good quality. Thus, stone architecture (石造) and sculpture flourished from ancient times. This can be glimpsed even today from artistic relics like stone pagodas (石塔), stone Buddhas (石佛), stupas (浮屠), stone steles (石碑), and stone lanterns (石燈). The method for manufacturing bricks (塼 / 煉瓦) reached great skill from ancient times, as imagined from the bricks discovered today in tombs from the Nangnang (樂浪) period before Koguryŏ (高句麗). Especially the fact that they displayed patterns, however simple, and their shapes were made convenient for construction, shows progress that even today's culture might not match. Even more astonishing is that during the Silla (新羅) period, even finer carving was expressed upon them. This too was because the soil material was suitable. Roof tiles (瓦) also circulated from ancient times, featuring various patterns (紋樣). Especially after the introduction of Buddhism, lotus flowers (蓮花) – extracting their blossoms or petals – were used to freely express bold ideals within elegant designs. Truly, Korea's local customs supplied numerous fine art materials to artistic geniuses. This is why many works were created from a mixture of stone, brick, and tile.

3. Religion and Politics: The relationship between Buddhism, the art of the era it was introduced, and the kings was already briefly discussed when examining its position in art history, so the political relationships of the time can generally be inferred. Each kingdom made Buddhism the state religion (國敎). Koguryŏ built nine temples (九寺) in P'yŏngyang, ordaining numerous monks and nuns (僧尼). In Silla, Buddhism greatly flourished, with every household performing rites. After the unification of the Three Kingdoms, monks (沙門) were appointed to official posts. In the 13th year of King Kyŏngdŏk (景德王), a great bell (大鍾) measuring one chang two ch'ŏk (approx. 3.6m) high, nine ch'on (approx. 27cm) thick, and weighing 497,581 kŭn (approx. 298 tons) was cast, and huge statues (巨像) like the sixteen-foot Buddha (丈六) were erected, marking the height of Buddhist veneration (崇佛). Paekche (百濟), worried that Silla's Buddhist flourishing far surpassed its own, built Wanghŭng Temple (王興寺), housed dozens of monks, and separately sent monks to mainland China to study Buddhist law.
As for Confucianism (儒敎), although King Sosurim (小獸林王) established the T'aehak (太學 / National Academy), it was merely for studying Chinese texts (漢文) to understand Buddhist truths. Later, in the 11th year of King Yŏngyang (嬰陽王), spring, first month, T'aehak Doctor Yi Munjin (李文眞) was ordered to compile the old histories (古史) into the five-volume Sinjip (新集). Confucian transmission <5> was also late in Silla, but by the time of King Sinmu (神武王), there were great scholars like Sŏl Ch'ong (薛聰). In the 4th year of King Wŏnsŏng (元聖王), spring, the Toksŏ Samp'um Kwa (讀書出身科 / Examination Based on Reading Classics) was first established. By the time of King Sŏngdŏk (聖德王), Confucianism greatly flourished.
"Sŏngdŏk Wang 16th year, T'aegam Such'ung (太監守忠), returning from Tang, presented images (像) of King Wenxuan (文宣王 / Confucius), the Ten Philosophers (十哲), and the 72 Disciples (72弟子), ordered placed in the Kukhak (國學 / National Academy)."
A National Academy was established, housing portraits (畵像) of Confucius, the Ten Philosophers, and the 72 Disciples. In the late period, there were great scholars like Ch'oe Ch'iwŏn (崔致遠) who promoted literature. However, since the portraits were brought from Tang, they likely had no connection to art. In Paekche, during the time of King Kŭnch'ogo (近肖古王), Kohŭng (高興) was appointed as Doctor (博士). Later, Doctor Wang In (王仁) went to Japan carrying the Analects (論語) and the Thousand Character Classic (千字文 / compiled by Zhong Yao 鍾繇 of Wei 魏). Japan's culture began from this point. However, Confucianism during the Three Kingdoms period amounted to little more than flavorless poetry and prose for self-cultivation and household management (修身齊家) or praising the virtues of former kings.
As for Daoism (道敎), Daoist priests (道士) and images of the Heavenly Honored One (天尊像) were transmitted from Tang in the 7th year of King Yŏngnyu (榮留王) of Koguryŏ. However, this too seems to have had no special connection with art. Only during the Koryŏ (高麗) period did Buddhism absorb it. Daoism's Jade Emperor (玉皇上帝) was transformed into Buddhism's Śakra (帝釋天) and enshrined on the Dharma altar (法壇). The Seven Stars (七星) were made into Buddhas (佛如來) based on the Big Dipper scriptures (北斗諸經), creating the Ch'ilsŏng Pavilion (七皇閣), where, like Daoists, prayers for longevity and wealth were offered.
Passing through the Unified Silla period to the Koryŏ period, it is said to have reached its zenith. This can be evidenced by the Ten Injunctions (十訓) of T'aejo (太祖) of Koryŏ. The first states: "The great enterprise of our nation relies solely on the protective power of the Buddhas. Therefore, establish temples for Sŏn (禪) and Kyo (敎) schools, dispatch abbots, have them perform rituals, and each manage their affairs." His faith and reliance on Buddhism were thus. The second states: "All temples were established based on Tosŏn's (道詵) divination of the favorable and unfavorable aspects of mountains and waters (山水順逆). Tosŏn said, 'If temples are recklessly built outside the places I have designated, it will damage the earth's virtue (地德), and the dynasty's fortune (祚業) will not last long.' I worry that in later generations, kings, dukes, marquises, queens, consorts, and court officials might call them their personal prayer halls (願堂) and perhaps add more creations. At the end of Silla, they competed in building floating pagodas (浮層), damaging the earth's virtue, leading to its fall. How can we not be cautious?" His reverence for the Buddhist master was such. The characteristic quality of T'aejo – who wielded a lone fist to sweep away the thousand-year entrenched powers and kicked aside the newly rising Kung Ye (弓裔) and Kyŏn Hwŏn (甄萱) to build the Koryŏ empire – is revealed here. Of course, this cannot be compared to Silla, which unified the Three Kingdoms with great difficulty, relying on borrowing over 100,000 Tang troops and an offensive-defensive alliance with its own strong army. As Silla's kings became immersed in the Buddhist doctrines of fortune and misfortune, events like the P'algwanhoe (八關會 / Festival of the Eight Vows) and Yŏndŭnghoe (燃燈會 / Lantern Festival), and the reckless clamor of foreign monks, led to the nation's strength declining daily, inviting licentious amusement among officials and commoners. The king remained unenlightened. Finally, when trampled by Kyŏn Hwŏn's weak troops, the king and his ministers were slaughtered, and palace women were violated, wasn't it natural for Koryŏ's T'aejo, who absorbed Silla, to earnestly argue against letting immersion in Buddhism <6> cause the downfall of its solemn dignity?
A record of the P'algwanhoe at that time:
"Koryŏ T'aejo, 1st year, 12th month, grandly held the P'algwanhoe. At the polo ground, one revolving lantern (輪燈) was set up, incense lanterns (香燈) blazed beside it, filling the ground, brightness penetrating the night. Also, two colored ropes (彩綱) were tied, each over five chang (approx. 15m) high, resembling ethereal lotus gazes. A hundred entertainments, songs, and dances (百戱歌舞) were presented before it."
P'algwanhoe refers to the Buddhist assembly where the vows are practiced: not killing (不殺生), not stealing (不偸盜), not engaging in sexual misconduct (不淫佚), not lying (不妄語), not consuming alcohol (不飮酒), not using high and large beds (不住高大床), not wearing perfumes or garlands (不著香華), not indulging in watching or listening to entertainment (不自樂觀聽). However, while such events as the P'algwanhoe and Paekchwahoe (百座會 / Hundred Seat Assembly) existed as solemn institutions for propagating Buddhism, in their later stages, they transformed into occasions for the monarch's feasting and pleasure, becoming a source of corrupted customs. Furthermore, monks stirred up trouble in the palace and ran rampant in the capital and countryside, their licentiousness immeasurable. Consequently, from the 8th year of King Kongmin (恭愍王), Confucian scholars began to refute them.
Although Koryŏ's T'aejo was deeply devoted to Buddhism, he also greatly favored Confucianism. During the reign of the 6th king, Sŏngjong (成宗), Ch'oe Ch'ung (崔冲) established the Nine Institutes (九齋) to educate students. Later, accomplished Confucian scholars like Yi Saek (李穡) and Chŏng Mongju (鄭夢周) were present, seeking to spread civil governance (文治). However, the people's hearts still turned to Buddhism. Temples and pagodas (堂塔), monasteries (伽藍) were built lavishly, exhausting the people's wealth (民財), leading to a hundred resulting evils. A poem by An Hyang (安文成公裕) reads:
"Incense and lamps everywhere pray to Buddha, pipes and flutes in every house compete in serving spirits. Only the few rooms of the Master's temple (夫子廟), its courtyard full of spring grass, silent and deserted."
Confucianism's decline was such. The progress of art also continued alongside the flourishing of Buddhist law. During King Sukchong's (肅宗) reign, a bronze statue of the Medicine Buddha (藥師銅像) weighing 366,700 kŭn (approx. 220 tons) was cast. However, from the early to mid-Koryŏ period, numerous styles were mixed, exemplified by the Ŭnjin Mireuk Stone Statue (恩津彌勒石像). Examining the old relics near Songdo (松都) also suggests such artistic transitions.
Towards the end of the Koryŏ period, Lamaism (喇嘛敎) from Yuan (元) was introduced, leaving a significant impact on art. This will be discussed in detail separately under the Koryŏ period. The bell from Yŏnbok Temple (演福寺鍾) in Kaesŏng (開城), now the South Gate Bell (南大門鍾) in Kaesŏng, is an example of Lamaist style; its casting method, patterns, and script show Lamaist characteristics. Additionally, in Ch'ungju City (忠州邑), North Ch'ungch'ŏng Province (忠淸北道), there is a marble Lamaist Buddha, the Thousand-Armed Avalokiteśvara (大理石造 千手觀音). The Kyŏngch'ŏn Temple Pagoda (擎天寺塔) and Wŏn'gak Temple Pagoda (圓覺寺塔) are Lamaist in form, testifying to the significant relationship between Lamaism and temples.
The Tripitaka woodblocks (大藏板) from King Hyŏnjong's (顯宗) time no longer exist even in trace, but the Koryŏ edition stored in the two Tripitaka halls (藏經閣) at Haein Temple (海印寺) in Hapch'ŏn (陜川) took about 15 years around the time of King Kojong (高宗) <7> to complete. Its number reaches a staggering 81,137 blocks. Without discussing its technical skill here, it is known by everyone that among existing editions, none surpasses this one in quality, and none surpasses these blocks in age – a peerless treasure of the world. Especially in the later period, independent works of art became increasingly visible. King Myŏngjong (明宗) excelled in painting (畵圖), particularly favoring landscapes (山水). King Kongmin (恭愍王) was also adept in both calligraphy and painting.
Yi T'aejo (李太祖), who overthrew Koryŏ, thoroughly investigated the evils of Buddhism, confiscating temple lands (官田). King Munjong (文宗) sought to abolish Buddhism, strictly prohibiting people from becoming monks or nuns. King Sŏngjong (成宗) went further, closing Buddhist temples within the capital and converting them into schools. Thus, the Yi Dynasty (李朝) suppressed and prohibited Buddhism, striving almost to leave not even its physical form (形骸) behind. While it's not entirely true that none among the Yi dynasty kings attempted its revival, Buddhism, which had caused a major transformation in the character of the peninsular people since its introduction and was poised to become a great artistic nation alongside the nation's development, was subjected to cruel oppression, ultimately preventing the spirit of progress from re-emerging. The only refuge (托身處) for banished monks was deep mountains and hidden valleys (深山幽谷), befriending mountain birds and wild beasts (山禽野獸). Recovering the light of Buddha (佛光) was difficult. The even harsher oppression by Confucianism ultimately forced them into solitary wandering like water and clouds. Withered reeds by the roadside, battered by storms and snow, might await the spring to bloom again, but what of Buddhism, uprooted at its core? That its sorrowful lifeline (哀怨한 命脈) barely persists today is fortunate, but what can be said of our art? Only calligraphy and painting (書畵), which had shown independent tendencies since the Koryŏ period, remained in isolation.
The above briefly outlines the historical relationship between religion, politics, and art. Generally, when solemn and lofty Buddhism flourished as the state religion under good governance, our art also shone brightly, forming one of its distinct characteristics. Following its gradual decline in the later period, independent works of art, freed from religious constraints (羈絆), showed faint signs of sprouting (萌芽), however weak.

Section 3: Difficulties in Research
Art, of course, refers to the three fields of architecture, sculpture, and painting (recently, some include calligraphy among them). To study art history is therefore to investigate the historical facts of their transitions and changes. However, do such relics actually remain preserved to serve as objects of research? How is it? For over 500 years, Confucianism prospered, suppressing Buddhism, and the brilliant Buddhist art gradually <8> declined, as already mentioned. Buddhist temples were closed and converted into Confucian academies (寺院), old monks were expelled beyond the city walls, and the young were returned to be educated as Confucians. How could complete preservation be expected? Furthermore, encountering the calamities of war numerous times also makes this natural. Today, even the evening bell (晩鍾), which once echoed across the sky from temple rooftops over the silent surroundings, no longer rings, intensifying the desolation of remote, poor villages. Thousands of monasteries (僧伽藍) and pagodas (塔婆) have crumbled, vines climb the Buddha halls (佛堂); dilapidation and sparseness prevail. Alas, with Buddhist temples, the sole objects of study, in such a state, Buddha statues are destroyed, and wall paintings are stained by dust and rain. Then, what value does Confucianism, which brought this about, hold in art history? In Confucian shrines (孔子廟) scattered everywhere, only a few fragments of ritual vessels (俎豆之片) are found. What can be sought there?
How can this compare to Japan (扶桑國), which treasures and preserves even a single wooden building (木造建築物) as a treasure? We cannot match them, who have ample objects for research. We only feel the mounting difficulties. Occasionally, artworks like old calligraphy (遺墨) are not entirely absent, but they are all hidden away in the hands of unknown wealthy individuals in the capital or provinces. These important and valuable artworks, even peerless world treasures, decay into vulgarity along with minor antiques (骨董品). Even the few relics said to remain are in such circumstances. The difficulty of researching art history is palpable.
Then, what about written records concerning ancient art? Do they actually exist? One cannot help but sigh deeply. Setting this aside for now, do records of political changes even exist? It would be difficult to say they fill rooms to the rafters (汗牛充棟). Yet, among them, does even one systematically transmit facts with certainty and evidence? It's vague, still subject to conflicting arguments (甲論乙駁). Reaching this point, asking about the existence of records related to art seems rather foolish. Especially for us, who did not even try to understand what art meant, who rather despised it, how could we expect such records? Relics do not remain, and records are also absent. Are there even vague legends (荒迷한 傳說)? Due to recent social customs, we have despised and ignored them. Who would have bothered to transmit them? That is, due to the negative effects of late Confucianism, who would have attached importance to something unrelated to factional disputes (黨論) between North and South, old and young, or passing the civil service exams (科擧) for fame? Today, not a single name of the creators of the past is passed down orally. Everyone avoids the unpredictable shame. Even if an outstanding genius had been born, what use would it have been? They merely lived and died in obscurity.
However, amidst this misfortune, what can be called fortunate is that our ancestors believed in P'ungsu theory (風水說 / Geomancy; also 地理法, 相地術, 堪輿術) since ancient times.<9> P'ungsu means "harnessing wind and obtaining water" (藏風得水). It refers to the theory of finding land where the configuration of mountains and rivers meets special conditions, and building capitals, palaces, or tombs (墳墓) there to ensure the prosperity and flourishing of a nation or family. This theory was initiated by a diviner (方士) named Lou Jing (婁敬 / Qingwuzi 靑烏子) during the Han Dynasty. It gradually spread during the Jin Dynasty and reached its peak during the Tang Dynasty. The peninsula also came under its influence, and it was practiced during the Unified Silla period. Tosŏn (道詵), having visited Songak (松岳), predicted the future birth of Wang Kŏn (王建), and is thus regarded as the progenitor (鼻祖) of this theory. Entering the Koryŏ period, it became even more prevalent, used for establishing capitals, founding towns, and constructing palaces. Later, the theory was gradually applied to selecting sites for royal tombs (陵墓). This actually has a very significant relationship with the preservation of artworks. During the Yi Dynasty, it spread among all classes, high and low, to the extent that even poor villagers in remote areas widely practiced it. The method generally involves leveling a mountainside to build upon, always facing south. Mountains should enclose it on the left and right; the left, or eastern mountain, is called Blue Dragon (靑龍), and the right, or western mountain, White Tiger (白虎). The back, or north, is named Black Tortoise (玄武). Water should emerge flanking the mountain and flow south; the place where streams converge in front and flow down is considered the most suitable spot, called the gathering place of mountains and water. Here, revering their ancestors and seeking blessings for future generations, people invested immense effort in constructing ancestral tombs. Among these, especially the tombs of nobles, and even more so, kings and princes, formed great mounds (丘陵), concealing countless burial goods (副葬品), finished with exquisite refinement. Later, protecting these generation after generation was paramount. Therefore, many outstanding artworks from that time were buried underground and remain well-preserved even today. Systematically excavating these old tombs (古墳) provides auxiliary help for art history research. Though merely P'ungsu theory, its contribution to world art history is not insignificant.
Next, important objects for research are Buddhist relics.
1. Sculptures (彫刻品): These are numerous, including stone pagodas (石塔), stupas (浮屠), lanterns (燈籠), stone Buddhas (石佛), etc. Although weathered by wind and rain, barely retaining their original forms, many are almost completely preserved to this day.
2. Cast Objects (鑄造品): Items like gold, silver, bronze, ironware, bronze bells (銅鍾), tripods (鼎). Being metal, these have undergone many transformations. It's natural that original items from the past are rare.
3. Architectural Structures (建築物): Needless to say, almost no wooden structures (木造) are preserved. The oldest extant wooden buildings number only a few structures belonging to the Koryŏ period. Only stone-built fortress walls, altars (壇), and especially the burial chambers (玄室) of old tombs represent ancient art. However, due <10> to their large size, these too have suffered considerable collapse.
In summary, among artworks, only those whose material nature, like metal or stone, allowed them to survive without preservation efforts remain. The rarity of wooden items is thus imaginable. Are these naturally surviving relics truly well-preserved? No. Stone materials were taken and reused in house construction; bronze and iron objects were melted down and reused for casting weapons, etc. An inscription on the bronze bell of Kapsa Temple (甲寺) on Kyeryong Mountain (鷄龍山), South Ch'ungch'ŏng Province (忠淸南道), states:
"In the 7th month of the 11th year of Wanli (萬曆 / 1583), the rebellion of the northern barbarians (北道夷狄) began. Consequently, the great bells of temples in the three provinces were uniquely broken, all taken and submitted to the state for casting weapons (兵器) and cannons (火砲). Therefore, they suddenly disappeared. Everyone lamented, saying, 'Not a few major temples lack the place to pray for the longevity of His Majesty morning and evening.' At that time, Muan (無顔) immediately encouraged [the effort], and in the summer month of Kapshin (甲申 / likely 1584), the great bell of Kapsa Temple (岬士寺) on East Kyeryong Mountain in Kongju was newly cast with donated iron (鐵入千斥), to be passed down for ten thousand generations (萬世流傳)."
Whether this was a method of suppressing Buddhism is unknown, but if cast objects suffered such fates, what can be said of others? Japan, preserving many brilliant artistic wooden structures, observes the extreme scarcity of stone structures, while we count our comparatively numerous stone structures that survived thousands of calamities, prompting admiration for their grand, majestic, and splendid characteristics. How then can we imagine the wooden architecture of our past? If even our relics, almost inevitably destined for collapse, still allow us to boast in the world's art circles (藝苑), what must have been the art of that era when gold gleamed brightly?
With such superior qualities yet scarce objects of study, research difficulties multiply. With transcendent artisans (技匠) yet no transmission, the difficulty of research is felt even more keenly.<11>

**Summary**

This article by Pak Chonghong discusses the characteristics of Korean art, positioning it as a unique crystallization within the broader East Asian tradition, heavily influenced by Chinese artistic principles like Xie He's Six Laws but also shaped by Korea's specific geography, climate, popular temperament, and resources (like granite). It emphasizes the profound impact of Buddhism in fostering a grand, solemn artistic style, evident in temples, pagodas, statues, and bells, particularly during Silla and Koryŏ. The author laments the subsequent decline under Yi Dynasty Confucianism, which suppressed Buddhism and led to the destruction or neglect of artifacts. He highlights the severe difficulties in studying Korean art history due to the scarcity of surviving artworks (especially wooden structures and paintings), the lack of written records, and the loss of artisans' names, contrasting this with Japan's better preservation. The P'ungsu tradition is noted as an unexpected aid, preserving burial goods in tombs. From a colonial history perspective, the article reflects a strong nationalist sentiment, seeking to define and elevate a distinct Korean artistic heritage against the backdrop of perceived decline and loss. It underscores the cultural damage attributed to the Yi Dynasty's policies and laments the present state, implicitly critiquing the conditions hindering the appreciation and study of national art during the early colonial period. Historians might find the author's framing of Korean art's distinctiveness, his views on the interplay of Buddhism and Confucianism, and his poignant description of research challenges valuable insights into early 20th-century Korean cultural consciousness.

朝鮮美術의 史的 考察-
						朴鍾鴻
第2節 朝鮮美術의 特色과 成因
美術史上의 位置로서 朝鮮美術의 特色도 過半은 斟酌되지 안흠은 아닐지니 東洋美術의 結晶인 以上 理想으로나 技巧로나 그의 總合體임을 알지라. 東洋美術의 特色을 歸納한 者가 이에 朝鮮美術의 特色이오, 朝鮮美術의 特色을 演繹함이 이에 東洋美術의 特色을 論함이라, 東洋美術이 崇高悲壯의 幽趣를 藏하얏는가, 朝鮮美術의 想을 可測也요, 朝鮮美術이 絢爛鮮明의 雅韻을 發하는가, 東洋美術의 精을 可窺로다.

第1 , 繪畫上의 特色과 成因 特色上 最殊한 者는 그 中 繪畵上에 表現되니 果然 今日의 審美學上의 法則에 準標하야 批評키 卒難한 者―라, 即 東洋畵의 性質을 解得코저할진채 爲先 筆法의 何者임을 解得치 아니치 못할지라, 畵家의 金科玉條로 삼는바― 南齊謝赫의 所謂 六法이 有하니
一曰氣運生動, 二曰骨法用筆, 三曰應物像形, 四曰隨類傳彩, 五曰經營位置, 六曰傳摹移寫.
氣運生動의 次로 骨法用筆을 揭하고 應物像形을 其下에 列하니 寫生을 爲主하는 西洋畵와는 勿論 判然한 區別이 有한 者―로다. 宋의 郭若虛가 畵의 三病을 云謂한 것도 全然用筆을 論한 者―라 할지니.
一曰板, 板則腕弱筆癡, 全虧取與, 將物平偏不能圓渾, 二曰刻, 刻則運筆中凝, 心手相戾, 向畵之際, 妄生圭角, 三曰結, 結則欲行不行, 當散不散, 似物遰擬, 不能流暢.＜1＞
然而六法의 第一位를 占한 者는 氣運生動이라. 氣運(氣韻)은 畵家의 先天的 才性에 本하는 者인즉 可히 學하야 達할 바―아니라 할새 王安節은 此를 論하야 曰
骨法以下 五端可學而成, 氣運必在生知
一位를 數한 氣韻이 이미 如斯히 生知에 在한지라, 故로 畵學之者는 不可不 먼저 骨法用筆을 豫習치 아니치 못할지니 또한 現在까지도 此를 그의 職이라 하야 最重要視하는 所以일지로다.
西洋畵에서는 物象의 輪廓과 皺條를 表함에 不過하는 線條가 如斯히 重大한 職能을 有하는 者는 大槪 書畵同軆의 觀念에서 出한 者―라 할지니 揚維禎이 曰
書與畵一耳, 士大夫工畵者必工書, 其畵法卽書法所有,
오즉 筆法之妙로서야 氣韻을 生動케하는 者―니 夏文彦이가 云
氣韻生動曰 神品, 筆墨超絶曰 妙品, 形似規矩曰 能品,
形似, 設色, 經營 位置와 如한 者는 第 一의 氣韻을 助成하는 者가 될 뿐이라, 此亦 千篇一律을 期할 者는 아니니 우리에게도 筆法보다도 寫形을 取하는 畵家가 不少할지나 用筆이 自在함을 得한 然後에 비롯오 形似傳彩 等은 學習할 것이라하니 東洋畵의 特色이 實로 此에 存하도다.
是以로 寫實法의 缺乏을 不免하는 者―니 何某나 一次 東洋畵를 鑑賞하는 者―遠近과 上下에 畵者가 一視點을 不有함을 云謂할지요, 設色이 假使 獨立的 調和는 되엇다 할지라도 그 非自然的이며 人物描寫에 그의 一이나 그 個性을 表現함이 無한 等 事에는 難設이 亦多할지로다.
然이나 新美術의 新運動으로서 印象派가 起하며 立體派가 生하는 今日을 當하야는 또한 東洋畵와 隱密裡에 握符하는 바―無하다 論키 難할지니 우리의 美術은 實로 一種의 印象畵로 成功한 者―라 云할지로다. 又況 未來派의 絶叫하는 바는 오히려 우리를 凌過하엿다 云할 者 임이리오, 東西兩洋의 美術이 如斯히 符合함은 그 美感의 相同함을 證함이니 詩人만 어찌 意思同이리오, 東洋畵의 大한 缺點이 此에 存하며 그의 特長이 또한 此에 在함이니 可히 踈忽에 付할 者가 아닐 새 果然 氣韻이 그의 生命이로써라.＜2＞

第2 , 一般美術上 特色과 成因 佛宇와 城塔의 雄麗를 生한 建築과 그 內部外圍의 幽雅를 出한 彫刻이 陸離한 色彩로써 成한 佛畵와 相應하야 無窮無盡한 情趣를 興케함은 何로써 由來함인가, 次에 그 成因을 探究하며 그의 理想上 特色을 並論코저 하노라, 成因의 主要件되는 者는 地勢 氣候와 人民의 氣質, 風土, 宗敎와 政治 等이라.

1, 地勢 氣候와 人民의 氣質 大陸의 東端인 半島로 北部에 白頭山脈을 背하고 太白山聯脈이 南行하야 脊梁山脈을 形成하니 北方은 地理上 倍達族의 本地인 滿洲平野를 隔할새 偉大한 自然內에 生한 雄豪한 美術的 性情이 此에 在하며 漢과 六朝의 文化의 媒介所를 成하야 半島 美術界의 先頭者가 된지라, 東海岸은 斷崖絶壁이 多하야 屈曲이 稀少함으로 良港이 乏하니 人文이 未開하얏슴도 當然할지라, 비록 潮汐干滿의 차가 少하나 狹長한 帶地에 傾斜가 急하야 大河巨川의 注하는 者도 無하니 中央에 元山港이 有하나 茫茫한 日本海를 隔함으로 그 亦交通이 不便하얏스며 더욱 高山峻嶺을 背하야 朝鮮 內地와의 交涉도 極難함으로 美術史上 硏究할만한 好資料를 不存함은 事實이나 東으로 南下한 扶餘族의 그 雄濶無碍한 特色을 우리 美術이 容納하얏슬  것도 事實일지라, 此와 反하야 西海岸은 高隆한 山脈이 無하고 鴨綠江, 大洞江, 漢江 等의 長江大河가 連注함으로 到處에 沃野가 相連하야 水運이 便하며 農業에 適하니 古昔 「간지스」河畔의 印度族과 가티 「나일」江邊의 埃及族과 가티 黃河 沿岸의 漢族과 가티 文化가 大開한지라, 海岸은 灣入이 豊多하고 中國과 相對하얏슴으로 數多한 良港은 그와 往來가 常頻하야 그 文物의 影響을 또한 多蒙하니 燦爛한 美術이 今日에 可測키 難한 바―도 아닐지로다. 南方은 小山脈의 起伏이 繁雜하므로 溫雅鮮麗한 特色을 有하니 일즉 北方的 武風을 融合하야 東南으로 海를 隔한 日本에게까지도 그의 潤光은 普及되엇도다. 然而此에 注意할 것은 西北方의 美術이니 是는 彼印度 「간다라」美術이 印度의 固有인 佛敎的 意匠과 希腦的 技巧와를 倂合하야 超然한 者와 如히 東進하야 唐式을 容한 此 「간다라」美術 更히 朝鮮化하야 玆에 東洋 美術의 結晶을 建成하얏슴이라, 今에 그 遺跡까지＜3＞ 荒頹됨도 彼와 相類한 者―니 朝鮮의 「간다라」 地方이라고도 云할지로다.
氣候도 勿論 其 地勢上 關係로 因하야 夏節에 炎熱이 太甚하고 冬季에 寒氣가 極酷한 地方임으로 人民의 氣質上 貫一徹透하는 精神을 注加함이로다. 特히 夏期라도 比較的 雨量이 少하야 空氣가 乾燥하니 寒暑의 雨甚과 倂하야 家屋과 衣服 等 日常生活上에도 그의 特色을 具備함이라.
吾人이 今에 至하야 坐處함이 常例임으로 家屋 建築上 天井의 高濶함을 不要하얏스니 寒氣를 防禦키 爲하야 堅厚한 墻壁으로 區間한 溫突式의 狹小低矮한 建築도 有하며 窓戶가 四開하고 炎熱한 夏日에 凉風의 流通이 自然스러운 高樓巨閣의 築營도 有하도다. 筒袂가 洋服과 似하야 身體와 相合하는 男服도 有하며 衣裳의 寬幅이 진실로 藝術的으로 作成된 女服도 在하도다.
以上에 述한 바와 如히 그의 何時代임을 莫論하고 그의 周圍의 環境이 그 等으로 하야곰 朝鮮 美術의 特色을 形成케 한지라 佛敎 傳來와 共히 中國과 印度의 影響을 多蒙하얏스니 그는 吾人의 天賦인 雄濶深奧한 大陸 氣風을 覺醒시킴에 至하얏도다. 荒遠한 沙漠, 峻險한 高嶺, 鬱鬱한 森林, 廣闊한 原野 等 自然의 偉高崇嚴한 氣質이 我에 存할새 또한 우리 美術品에서 索求할지로다. 一面으로 外國의 模倣이 不無하얏스나 그는 오즉 吾人에게 潛伏한 美術的 本性을 表現케 한 者에 不過하니 此를 擧皆 朝鮮化하얏슴으로써라. 又 東海를 隔하야 諸島國과 隣하니 그의 優麗, 快活, 纖細 等 明妙한 雅趣의 感化가 亦是 不尠하얏슬지라.
嗚呼吾人의 先祖는 果然 偉大하얏스며 明媚하얏도다. 그 等은 그 天眞自具의 美術的 本性을 任意로 그 等의 마음껏 美術品上에 表現시키엇도다.

2, 風土 風土는 美術의 資料를 供給함에 最要한 關係를 有하는 者―니 今에 至하야 森林에 缺乏한 朝鮮인 故로 家屋建築 等의 良材를 難得이라하나 狼林山系로부터 鴨綠江邊의 檀木과 松材로서 推想할진대 本來가 其然한 者는 아님을 可知요, 彫刻에 沈檀이 善用되엇다 함을 보아도 如何한 者이엇슴을 可解로다. 아즉 木造 本位를 未脫한 우리 建築에는＜4＞ 材料求得의 不便이 今日과 如한 吾人의 現狀으로 그의 發達을 期키 難할진저.
次에 朝鮮은 地質上 片麻巖, 花崗巖 等 所謂 古世紀層에 屬하는 者―라, 地層의 變化가 稀少함으로 人民의 氣質이 一便悠悠然不動의 特色을 表하며 美術의 資料上 關係는 是等石材에 豊富하야 産出이 頗多한 中品質이 良好함으로써 石造의 建築과 彫刻 等은 昔時로부터 發達 盛行하얏섯다. 今日의 卽 石塔, 石佛, 浮屠, 石碑, 石燈 等의 美術的 遺品으로써도 可히 窺知할만한 者―로다. 塼(煉瓦)의 製造法은 古代로부터 巧妙를 極하니 今日에 高句麗 以前 樂浪시대의 古墳으로부터 發見되는 塼으로써 聯想되는 者―라, 特히 單純하나마 模樣을 示現하며 形體가 築造上 便利하도록 製作한 等 事는 今日의 文化로도 尙且不可及일만큼 進步하얏든 者―라, 更히 可驚에 値할만한 것은 新羅時代에 至하야 尤一層 優秀한 彫刻을 其上에 表現함이로다. 是亦 土質上 材料가 그에 適合함으로써니 瓦도 自古로 夙行되어 各樣의 紋樣이 有할새 佛敎 傳來 以後는 特히 蓮花로써 그 朶或은 花瓣을 摘出하야 優麗한 模樣 中에 雄豪한 理想을 任意로 表出하얏슴이로다. 實로 朝鮮은 그 風土上 數多한 美術의 好資料를 藝術的 天才에게 供給하는 것이니 此로 因하야 石, 塼, 瓦 等의 混合으로써 成來한 者도 亦多한 所以라.

3, 宗敎와 政治 佛敎와 그 傳來時代 美術과의 關係는 美術史上 位置를 論하는 時에 已述한 바―어니와 同時에 國王과의 關係도 略說하얏슨즉 當時의 政治上 關係도 大槪 斟酌 되는 事일지라. 各其 佛敎로써 國敎를 作하니, 高句麗는 平壤에 九寺를 建하야 數多한 僧尼를 度하며 新羅는 佛法이 大興할새 家家作禮요 及其 三國統一하야는 沙門으로써 官을 拜하니 景德王 13年에는 長이 一丈二尺厚가 九寸重量이 497,581斤에 至하는 大鍾을 鑄造하며 丈六의 巨像 等을 興하야 崇佛이 極하얏도다. 又 百濟는 新羅 佛敎의 興盛함이 己보다 遙凌함을 憂하야 王興寺를 建하고 數十의 僧侶를 置하며 別로 中國 大陸에 沙門을 送하야 그 佛法을 學케 하얏도다.
儒敎는 小獸林王時에 太學을 立함이 有하얏스나 漢文을 論究하야 佛敎의 眞理를  解得코저 함에 不過 하얏스며 其後末世 嬰陽王 11年 春正月에 太學博士 李文眞으로 하야곰 古史를 約하야 新集 五卷을 作케한지라, 新羅에는 傳儒가＜5＞ 亦遲하얏스나 神武王 時에는 薛聰과 如한 碩儒가 不無하얏스며 元聖王 4年 春에는 讀書出身科를 始定하얏도다. 聖德王 時에 至하야는 儒敎가 大興할 새
聖德王16年, 太監守忠, 自唐還, 獻文宣王, 十哲, 72弟子像, 命置國學.
大學을 設하야 孔子·十哲·72弟子의 畵像을 安置하고 末期에는 崔致遠과 如한 碩士가 有하야 文學을 奬勵하얏스나 畵像은 唐으로부터 持來한 者인즉 美術과의 關係가 有한 者도 아니엇슬 듯 하며 百濟는 近肖古王 時에 高興으로써 博士를 拜하고 其後에 또 博士 王仁이 論語와 千字文(魏鍾繇撰)을 齎하고 日本에 往하니 日本의 文化가 自此로 始行한지라, 然而三國時代의 儒敎는 修身齊家가 아니면 先王의 德을 頌하는 無味乾燥한 詩文에 不過하얏도다.
道敎는 高句麗 榮留王 7年에 唐으로서 道士와 天尊像 等이 傳來하얏스나 此亦 美術과는 特殊한 關係가 無한 듯 하며 오즉 高麗 時代에 至하야 佛敎가 그를 攝取하니 道敎의 玉皇上帝를 佛敎의 帝釋天에 化하야 法壇上에 安置하고 七星을 北斗諸經에 依하야 佛如來로 作하니 七皇閣을 造하고 道家와 如히 延命增富를 祈願함에 在하얏슬 뿐이라.
新羅 統一 時代를 經하야 高麗時代에 至하매 그의 絶頂에 到達함이라 云한 者―니 高麗 太祖의 十訓으로서 可히 此를 證할지라, 其一에 「我國家의 大業은 오즉 諸佛護衛의 力에 資한 것이라. 是故로 禪敎의 寺院을 創立하며 住持를 差遣하고 此를 焚修하야 各기 其業을 治케 할지니라.」하니 그 佛敎에 歸依한 信念이 如斯하얏스며 其二에「諸寺院은 皆是道詵의 山水의 順逆을 推占하야 開創한 者―라, 道詵이 云『吾의 占定한 處外創造를 妄有한다 하면 即 地德을 損薄하며 祚業이 不永할지라.』하니 朕은 量컨대 後世에 國王, 公侯, 后妃, 朝臣이 各其 願堂이라 稱하야 或은 增創할가 念慮하는 바―라. 新羅之末에 浮層을 競造하야 地德을 壤損하매써 亡함에 至하얏도다. 豈可而不戒할 者―리오」하니 그 佛師를 崇信함이 爾然하얏스며 孤拳을 揮하야 千年盤根之勢를 掃蕩하고 新進 勃興의 弓裔, 甄萱을 一蹴하야 高麗의 天下를 築한 太祖의 太祖다운 特性이 此에 發하도다. 勿論 大唐 10餘萬의 大兵을 借하고 自國의 强兵과 攻守同盟에 依하야 艱辛히 三國을 統一한 新羅와는 同轍之論이 아닐지니 新羅의 諸王이 佛氏禍福之說에 沈溺하야 八關, 燃燈의 會와 胡僧의 妄騷 等은 國力의 萎微가 日甚하되 士民의 淫遊를 招하고 國王도 亦是 不悟라 듸디어 甄萱의 弱兵에게 蹂躪되여 君臣이 殺戮되며 宮女가 受辱함에 至하야는 그를 倂呑한 高麗 太祖가 佛敎에 沈溺함으로＜6＞ 그 崇嚴의 落下됨을 誘致케 말 것을 切論함도 當然한 事가 아니랴.
當時 八關會의 光景을 記하니
高麗太祖元年12月, 大設八關會, 遂於毬庭置輪燈一所, 香燈旁烈滿地, 光明徹夜, 又結彩綱兩所, 各高五丈餘, 狀若蓮望之縹緲, 呈百戱歌舞於前.
八關會라는 佛式의 不殺生, 不偸盜, 不淫佚, 不妄語, 不飮酒, 不住高大床, 不著香華, 不自樂觀聽을 修講하는 學會를 稱하는 者-라, 然而嚴肅한 佛敎傳布의 機關으로 是等 八關會, 百座會가 有하얏스나 그 末葉에 至하야서는 君主의 飮宴歡樂의 機關으로 化하야 風俗 破壤의 源泉을 生한지라, 더욱 僧侶로서 宮中을 攪亂하며 京鄕간에 橫行하야 淫度를 不測이라, 이에 恭愍王 8年에 비롯오 儒生이 그 等을 反駁함에 至하얏도다.
高麗 太祖는 崇佛이 如斯히 甚하얏스나 儒敎를 亦是 甚好하얏나니 6代 成王 時에 至하야 崔冲이 九齋를 作하야 諸生을 敎育하얏스며 그 後 李穡, 鄭夢周 等 通儒가 在하야 文治를 布코자 하얏스나 民心은 오히려 佛에 歸하니 堂塔, 伽藍을 盛建할 새 民財가 竭하니 流弊가 從是로 百出이라, 安文成公裕의 詩에
香燈處處皆祈佛, 簫管家家競事神, 獨有數間夫子廟, 滿庭春草寂無人,
儒敎의 零殺함이 如斯하얏스니 美術의 進步도 佛法의 興함을 乘하야 共히 繼續되엇나니 肅宗 時에는 366,700斤의 藥師銅像을 鑄造한 事가 有하얏도다. 然而 高麗 初期로부터 中期까지는 許多한 樣式을 混用하얏스니 恩津彌勒石像이 그 一例일지오, 松都 附近의 古跡遺物로써 此를 推察할 지라도 美術의 如斯히 變遷하얏슴이 推想될지라.
高麗 末葉에 至하야 元의 喇嘛敎가 傳來하니 美術上에 多大한 影響을 遺한 지라, 此는 別로 高麗時代에서 詳論코저 하는 바-어니와 開城 演福寺鍾이든 開城 南大門鍾은 喇嘛式의 例니 鑄造法과 模樣, 文字는 喇嘛式임을 可知요, 其外 忠淸北道 忠州邑에는 大理石造 千手觀音의 喇嘛佛이 有하며 擎天寺塔과 圓覺寺塔은 그 形式上 喇嘛式이니 喇嘛敎와 寺院과의 關係가 多大하얏슴을 證하도다.
顯宗 時의 大藏板은 今에 그 形跡쪼차 不留이나 陜川 海印寺 兩宇 藏經閣에 蓄存된 高麗本은 高宗 時 前後 15年間을＜7＞ 費한 者-니 其數-實로 81,137枚에 至하는지라, 玆에 其 技巧上 如何는 論치 아니하거니와 現在 藏本 中에 善하기 此本에 及할 者-無하며 古하기 此板에 及할 者-無한 世界의 絶寶라 함은 그 誰某나 不知하는 者-無할지로다, 더욱 後期에 至하야는 獨立的 美術品을 屢見케 되니 明宗은 畵圖에 精하고 더욱 山水에 寄하앗스며 恭愍王이 또한 書畵가 다 入妙하얏도다.
高麗를 亡한 李太祖는 크게 佛敎의 弊를 査察하야 寺院의 官田을 沒收하얏스며 文宗은 佛敎를 廢滅코자 하야 人民의 僧尼됨을 嚴禁하고 成宗에 至하야는 京內의 佛宇를 廢하야 學校에 充하얏도다. 如斯히 李朝는 佛敎를 壓迫禁制하야 庶乎 그 形骸까지 不殘코저 하얏도다. 李朝 歷代 君主 中 二三 그 再興을 圖코자 하엿슴이 全無함은 아닐지나 傳來 以後 半島民族의 性格上 一大變革을 生케 하야 國運의 發展과 伴하야 美術의 大邦國을 期하든 佛敎로 하야곰 慘酷한 壓迫의 結果 進步의 氣韻을 再萌치 못함에 至케 하얏도다, 追放을 當한 僧侶의 托身處는 深山幽谷이 存할 뿐이오, 山禽野獸로 知己를 作하니 佛光의 挽回를 難圖일새 尤益嚴烈한 儒敎의 壓迫은 그 等으로 하야곰 畢竟은 水雲의 蹤跡을 孤作케 하얏도다. 暴風吹雪에 路邊에 枯衰한 茅草는 또다시 發花의 春節을 待하려니와 根本을 採去된 佛敎임에 奈何오, 哀怨한 命脈이 尙今에 僅存하니 天幸이라 할 者이어니와 吾人의 美術로서야 能히 何者를 論할 바-리오, 오즉 高麗 時代부터 獨立的 氣向을 持來하든 書畵가 孤在하얏슬 뿐이라.
以上은 宗敎와 政治가 歷史上으로 美術과 關係된 바를 略說한 者-어니와 大槪 崇嚴雄高한 佛敎가 善政 下에 國敎로서 盛하얏슬 時에 우리의 美術도 異彩를 發하야 그의 一特色을 成하얏스며 後期의 漸次 衰退함을 隨하야는 宗敎의 羈絆을 脫한 獨立的 美術品이 微弱하나마 그의 萌芽를 認케 됨이라.

第 三節 硏究上의 困難
美術이라 云함은 勿論 建築, 彫刻, 繪畵의 三者를 稱함인즉(近者에 書法까지도 그 中에 編入하는 者도 잇스나) 美術史를 論究코저 할진대 또한 그 等의 推移, 變遷한 史實을 穿考함이라, 然而 그 等 遺跡이 果然 保存되어 硏究의 對象物이 될만한 者가 有한가, 如何, 500餘年 以來로 儒敎가 隆盛하야 佛敎를 壓頭하니 燦爛하얏던 佛敎的 美術이 漸次＜8＞ 衰退하얏슴도 已述한 바-라, 佛寺를 廢하야 寺院에 充하고 老僧을 城外에 追放하며 幼少를 還하야 儒로써 敎하니 어찌 完保를 期할 者-리오, 더욱 數次나 兵燹의 難을 遭하니 또한 當然한 事-라, 今日에 至하야는 昔者에 寺院의 屋上으로서 萬籟無聲之中에 蒼空을 越하야 四邊에 反響하던 晩鍾조차 不嗚일새 窮僻한 寒村의 寂寞은 尤加하도다. 千數百의 僧伽藍과 塔婆는 頹落하고 佛堂에 登蘿하니 荒廢가 簫疎로다. 嗚呼 唯一의 對象物이 될 佛宇로서 如斯하니 佛像은 破滅되고 壁畵는 塵雨에 沾汚하도다. 然則此事를 做出케 한 儒敎는 美術史上 如何한 價値를 有한가 處處의 孔子廟에는 數 個의 俎豆之片을 發見할 뿐이니 何者를 可求하리오.
彼 木造建築物의 一棟이라도 是爲寶라 하야 歸重히 保存하는 扶桑國에 어찌 비할 者이며 硏究의 對象物에 裕足한 彼에게 가히 對할 者-아니라, 다못 重難이 層疊함을 覺할 뿐이로다. 間或 古人의 遺墨 等 美術品이 全無함은 아닐지나 皆是人不知의 幽窟 가튼 京鄕富豪의 手中에 隱蔽되어 그 重且貴한 美術品도 世界無類의 至寶도 微微한 骨董品과 共히 俗化腐朽하고 마는지라, 이미 僅存되엇다는 遺物까지도 如斯한 境遇에 處한지라, 美術史 考究의 困難을 可測이로다.
然則 古代美術에 關한 文字上 記錄이 若何오, 果然 存在함이 有한가, 長歎을 不堪하는 바-로다. 此는 尙且姑捨하고 政變의 記錄이나 存한가, 汗牛充棟도 是非難事라 할지로다. 然而其中의 一이나 系統的으로 確實한 自信과 論證下에서 事實을 傳하는 者가 果然 存한가, 漠然하야 아즉 甲論乙駁, 吾人은 此에 至하매 美術에 關한 紀錄의 有無와 如한 者를 此에 問함은 돌이어 愚拙타 아니치 못할지로다. 特히 美術이라 함은 何者를 稱함인지 理解코자도 아니하얏든 吾人에게 돌이어 此를 賤示하던 吾人에게 어찌 此를 期할 바-리오, 遺品도 不存하고 記錄도 亦無라, 荒迷한 傳說이나마 有한가, 吾人은 近代의 社會的 慣習으로 此를 賤示不顧하얏스니 何某가 구태여 此를 傳코저 하얏스리오, 即 儒敎的 末弊로 南北老少의 黨論이나 科擧揚名에 無關한 者를 何某가 重要視 하얏스리오,  今에 至하야 昔日의 創造者의 英名이 一이나 口傳됨이 無하니 何某나 不測의 羞辱을 厭避함으로써라, 비록 特出한 天才가 生하얏섯다 한들 何用이 有하얏스리오, 오즉 隱隱裡에서 生하고 沒하얏슬 뿐이로다.
然而 此에 不幸 中 多幸이라 稱할 者는 古來로 吾人의 祖先이 風水說(地理法, 相地術, 堪輿術)을 信하얏슴이라.＜9＞ 風水라 云함은 藏風得水의 義라, 山河의 形勢가 特殊한 條件과 符合하는 地를 相하야 其處에 都邑, 宮室, 墳墓 等을 營造하야써 一國一家의 興隆繁榮을 圖하는 法을 說함이라, 此說은 漢代에 婁敬(靑烏子)이라는 方士가 始創한 者라, 晉代에 稍行하다가 唐代에 至하야 極盛한 者-니 半島도 그 影響을 蒙하야 新羅統一時代에 旣行하얏나니 道詵이 松岳에 嘗遊라가 他日 王建의 出生을 豫言하얏슴으로 此說의 鼻祖로써 目하도다. 高麗時代에 入하야는 尤益 盛行하니 建都, 設邑, 宮室, 營造 等에 使用하고 그 後에는 漸次 陵墓擇地에도 此說을 應用함에 至할새 此-實로 美術品의 保存과 甚大한 關係를 有한 者-라, 李朝에 至하야는 上下에 普及되어 甚至於 窮村孤民이라도 擧皆 盛行함에 至한지라, 其法이 大蓋 山腹을 平坦히 하야 此를 築하고 반듯이 南面한지라, 左右에 山이 繞圍할지니 左 即 東山은 曰 靑龍이오, 右 即 西山은 曰 白虎라 稱하며 背 即 北은 曰 玄武라 名하는지라, 水는 其山을 挾出하야 南流할지니 그 前面에서 會合하야 流下하는 곳이 最適處라, 山水의 聚集處라 云할지로다, 吾人이 此에 그 先祖를 尊崇하며 後代의 福樂을 爲하야 先人의 墳墓를 築營함에 莫大한 心勞을 配하도다, 그 中 貴族 더욱 王侯 等의 墳墓에 至하야는 一大丘陵을 成하니 無數한 副葬品을 藏하며 그 精麗를 盡하고 後에는 此를 世世代代로 保護하기 此에 過할 者-無하얏도다, 故로 當時의 美術品 中 優秀한 者-皆是 地下에 埋葬되어 今日에 至하기까지 尙且完存된 者-不少한지라. 此 古墳을 順序 잇게 發掘함이 美術史 硏究上 一扶의 助力 이 되니 些少한 風水說일지나 世界美術史上에 貢獻한 功勞 또한 不少타 云할진뎌
其次에 硏究의 對象物로서 重한 者는 佛敎的 遺物이 是也라.
1. 彫刻品 其 中 多數한 者-니 石塔, 浮屠, 燈籠, 石佛 等이라, 風磨雨洗하야 그 本形을 僅存할 뿐이나 今日에 至하도록 幾乎完存에 近한 者-라.
2. 鑄造品 金, 銀, 銅, 鐵器, 銅鍾, 鼎과 如한 者-니 此 等은 그 金屬임으로써 또 許多한 變遷이 有하얏스니 昔時의 本品이 稀少함도 當然하도다.
3. 建築物 木造는 勿論 保存되어 잇는 者- 殆無하니 年代의 最古한 木造建築物이라고는 高麗時代에 屬할 者- 數棟이 殘存할 뿐이오, 다못 石築의 城廓壇, 더욱 古墳의 玄室 等과 如한 者가 古代의 美術을 代表하도다. 然이나 此＜10＞ 等은 그 形體의 大함으로 因하야 亦是 崩頹가 不少한지라.
以上을 總合컨대 美術品 中 그 資料의 本質上 金屬 或은 石材와 共히 保護의 勞를 被치 아니하야도 可히 遺存할 만한 者 뿐이니 木造와 如한 者의 稀貴함도 可想할지로다. 自然히 遺存된 此等 遺品은 果然 完存하얏다 稱할 만한 者인가, 否라. 石材는 取하야 家屋 建築에 補用하고, 銅, 鐵器는 兵器 鑄造 等에 다시 使用되고 말엇도다. 忠淸南道 鷄龍山 甲寺 銅鍾銘文에 曰
時維萬曆十一年七月爲始北道夷狄之亂大起因以獨折三道寺刹大鍾盡取納國兵器火砲鑄矣是以頓無人皆歎曰不少大刹寺朝暮爲 主上祝壽處時有無顔卽勸甲申夏巳月日公州東鷄龍山岬士寺大鍾新鑄成鐵入千斥萬世流傳.
佛敎排斥의 一法이엇는지는 不知也로되 鑄造이고서 如斯하얏스니 他者야 豈可以論할 者-리오, 建築 等 木造物의 燦然한 美術品을 多存한 日本이 石造物 等의 極少함을 觀하고 우리의 數千의 凶亂을 凌過하고 尙存한 石造物의 此較的 許多함을 數할새, 雄偉, 豪麗한 特色을 現함에 稱嘆을 不禁하는 者-어든 吾人의 當代의 木造建築을 推想함이리오. 幾乎頹崩은 難免인 吾人의 遺物로서 오히려 世界 藝苑에 自矜을 不惜하는 바-어든 金色이 燦然하얏든 當代의 美術이리오.
如斯히 優越한 素質이고서 對象物은 稀貴하니 硏究의 困難이 層出할지오, 技匠이 超凡하고도 傳함이 無하니 尤益 硏究의 困難을 切感할 뿐이로다.＜11＞
