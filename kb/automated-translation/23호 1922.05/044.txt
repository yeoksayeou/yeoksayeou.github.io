新學年 入學難과 우리의 覺醒
						金秉濬

Regarding the start of this new school term, the difficulty for Korean school-aged children to enter school, centered in Kyŏngsŏng but cried out about everywhere throughout all of Korea without exception, has surely been seen much in the general newspapers. Ultimately, as the examination dates for each school successively pass and the opening ceremonies take place in sequence, the number of youths who finally fail, shed tears, return home, or wander aimlessly on the path, despairing of their future, reaches many thousands, even tens of thousands, throughout all of Korea. Is this not the tragic and miserable reality we directly witness today? In this situation, for us Koreans, it is an unavoidable fact that we must possess a thorough awakening. Under this meaning, although repetitive, I wish to state a word by adding the reporter's impressions to several examples published in the newspapers.

One, The Astonishing Zeal for Learning Among Koreans

Recently, the zeal for learning among us Koreans is truly astonishing. Regardless of capital or countryside, the zeal for learning boiling up like a rapid tide cannot but give us, who are struck by it, a feeling of being unstoppable (沛然莫禦).

Here, we cannot help but look back at the educational situation of Koreans fourteen or fifteen years ago. What indeed was the past situation? Citing the circumstances of ○○ County (○○郡), the reporter's place of origin, is sufficient to infer the situation of all Korea. Initially, one county private school of higher elementary level was established, and when students were forcibly recruited at the rate of one county-funded student per fifty households, each village and hamlet (面里), fearing the so-called Education Opposition Law (in which law it exists, who knows?), reluctantly complied. However, the children of the influential people of the hamlet, the so-called *panjok* (班族, Yangban lineage), dared not be selected, and only the children of the lowest-class commoners (*sangmin*, 常民) were sent. Therefore, the parents and elder brothers of those selected were like sending their children off to a battlefield, even reaching the point of sending them off with tears (含淚而送). Or, in villages unable to comply, a fine of forty *won* was levied per fifty households, and they thought there was no greater glory than simply paying the fine and being exempted from student recruitment. And thereafter, when private schools were successively established at suitable locations in each village and hamlet, the residents of the area designated as the school location campaigned in hundreds of ways to exclude it. This is just one example of the past situation in the education world. <97> Not only ○○ County, but it was undoubtedly the same throughout all regions of Korea. Especially, the fact that the anti-education fervor was even more severe in the southern regions (南鮮), the center of stubborn scholars, is proven by the facts we directly experienced. For Koreans, whose enthusiasm for education was so weak, to suddenly reach the current trend, like the present situation, in the short period of merely ten years, namely since last year and this year, is indeed nothing short of astonishing. Even in the smallest locality like ○○ County, the reporter's place of origin, with a total household count barely exceeding six thousand, there were over eighty students studying abroad in Kyŏngsŏng currently; furthermore, including students studying abroad in various parts of Korea, Japan, and China, the number reached over three hundred (a ratio of fifty per thousand households). What is even more astonishing and congratulatory is the zeal for learning in the southern regions, which had been the most backward. Even the disciples of Confucian scholars who, as if it were yesterday, loudly proclaimed phrases like "(if it's not the words of the former sage kings, dare not speak; if it's not the attire of the former sage kings, dare not wear)" (非先王法言不敢道非先王法服不敢服), and the children of stubborn *yangban* who sang the praises of Lesser Sinic Culture (小華文物) and dreamed of Han Official Dignity (漢官威儀), have suddenly changed their minds under the strict precepts passed down from their teachers' gates and the inherited old customs from their ancestors, raised a banner of revolt, sought a single path to life, and turned their heads towards the school gate. This truly makes us unable to refrain from dancing for joy (手舞足蹈) for the future of our Korean nation.

As the zeal for learning throughout all of Korea thus successively reached the same high level, on the occasion of this year's new school term, an unprecedented situation unfolded where over twenty-five thousand admission application forms were distributed by the seven middle-school level schools in Kyŏngsŏng (Posŏng 普成, Chungang 中央, Hwimun 徽文, Yangjŏng 養正, Paejae 培材, Kyŏngsin 儆新, Tonggwang 東光). Accordingly, the number of students studying abroad (according to the travel certificate statistics issued just by the Chongno Police Station [鍾路署] from January to March 20th this year, already 105) sufficiently proves the yearly increase.

Moreover, the citizens of Kyŏngsŏng Prefecture (京城府), possessing over forty thousand school-aged children, having been immersed in the stubborn old customs of the 500-year-long dynasty, had relatively weak enthusiasm for education. Recently, however, the zeal for learning has suddenly become intense. This year, for the new school term, those who received certification of family register verification from the Kyŏngsŏng Prefecture Family Register Section to enroll their children in public elementary schools (as of March 15th) exceeded 22,000. Ultimately, after excluding four-fifths due to age restrictions, the number of applicants who submitted applications to the fourteen elementary schools within the prefecture reached a high of 4,805.

Then, from what motivation does this zeal for learning, which has reached such an extraordinary height, truly arise? Is it perhaps like a blind horse hearing a bell (瞎馬聞鈴 格)? There is definitely a need to investigate this once. Indeed it is so. Today, our single path to survival is truly found nowhere else but in education. For us, who are currently laggards in scientific knowledge, for us, who are losers in the struggle for survival, if we are to pioneer our vague future path of life and live like others, we must certainly know like others; and to know like others, we must certainly <98> learn like others. This has become the driving force that provoked the zeal for learning among us Koreans today. Therefore, for us Koreans, if we are to satisfactorily resolve our respective life-or-death problems, it lies in fully complying with this zeal for learning boiling up like a rapid tide. What, indeed, should be the measures for compliance?

Two, Emergency Measures for the School Entrance Difficulty

As mentioned above, the yearly surge in Koreans' zeal for learning is something anyone, without exception, should find astonishing and congratulatory. However, the fact that ultimately, due to lack of accommodation, four or five times, or even six or seven times or more, unsuccessful applicants are produced is truly a miserable sight that one cannot bear to witness! Here, citing the actual examples of a part of Kyŏngsŏng witnessed by the reporter is sufficient to imagine the situation throughout all of Korea. The numbers of admission applications distributed by Kyŏngsŏng's various middle schools—over 25,000—and the number of school-aged children's family register verifications at various elementary schools—over 22,000—even if attributed to various reasons and considered exaggerated, ultimately, including those who failed to meet the school quotas (about 1,300 for the seven middle schools, 2,259 for the fourteen elementary schools) and those who could not apply initially due to age restrictions (elementary school: full 6 years old to under 11; middle school: 11 years old to under 16), it is a fact passed down to this day that over 10,000 educationally disappointed individuals have been produced. Prominent members of society and parents who have directly witnessed the above tragic and miserable situation could not silently overlook it. Thus, they are currently launching an Emergency Committee for School Entrance Difficulty Relief, researching countermeasures. As a result, as a temporary emergency measure, they have submitted a petition, through representatives from each town and village (*chongdong*, 町洞), requesting the implementation of a two-shift teaching system (二部 敎授制) in the fourteen public elementary schools within the prefecture to rescue the unadmitted children, and are awaiting a satisfactory resolution. Following this, similar emergency measures are being researched and pursued in various regions. According to what has appeared in the newspapers:

At Kunsan Public Elementary School (羣山公立普通學校), for the children returning home after failing this time, a special course will exceptionally be established to accommodate all of them.

At Ch'ŏngyang Public Elementary School (靑陽公立普通學校), among the 170-plus unsuccessful children beyond the admission quota, ultimately about 100 could not enroll due to age restrictions, but the remaining 70-plus will be accommodated by establishing a special class.

At Sŏnch'ŏn Public Elementary School (宣川公立普通學校), regarding the inability of over 200 children aged 10 and above to enter due to lack of school buildings, the parents discussed relief measures and are planning to swiftly establish a private school.

At Yŏsu Public Elementary School (麗水公立普通學校), to rescue the 200-plus children unable to attend school this time, the local Youth Association (靑年會), together with local prominent figures and <99> parents, organized a relief committee and decided on the following matters: (1) To accommodate and teach all those outside the elementary school entrants. (2) Expenses to be covered by membership fees from parents who are relief committee members and prominent figures, and the burden of the Youth Association. (3) For classrooms, to borrow the old school building of the Fisheries School attached to the elementary school. (4) For teachers, to apply to the Provincial Governor and hire middle school graduates. (5) The level to be the same as the public elementary school.

The above can be said to be relief measures for elementary school-aged children throughout the capital and countryside. Besides this, regarding the youth unable to enter middle school level, prominent figures in the Kyŏngsŏng education world currently feel this keenly and, although it is only a stopgap measure (彌縫之策), have been busily setting up numerous lecture centers (講習所) for their relief. However, it is a fact that not all unsuccessful applicants can be accommodated without regret. Even if they were accommodated, allowing the youth, who are our future pathfinders, to receive such incomplete education—how could we, in our current situation, view this with indifference (恬然視之)?

However, at our current level, obtaining a completely satisfactory solution quickly is utterly impossible. Therefore, the reporter urges the prominent figures of local education circles and all parents with school-aged children, though incomplete, to adopt one measure suitable to their local circumstances from among the various relief measures mentioned above, so that the school-aged children with bright futures (洋洋) do not lament missing the time for education. This is precisely why the reporter, not avoiding the嫌 of repetition of what has been published in newspapers, garrulously offers these words.

Three, What We Must Awaken To

The so-called astonishing zeal for learning is a term limited only to the current level of Koreans; it can by no means be considered satisfactory for the future. For Korea, said to have at least 1.7 million school-aged children, how can this be satisfactory? As the number of children entering school will inevitably increase year by year along with the trends of the times, the corresponding measures for accommodation will require our thorough awakening from now on.

How can the so-called Three-*Myŏn* One-School system (三面 一校制) advocated by the authorities, which amounts to no more than perfunctory responsibility (塞責), satisfy our educational future? At the very least, unless there is a deployment of One-*Myŏn* One-School (一面一校), meaning 2,200-plus schools, it will be impossible to accommodate our zeal for learning, which increases monthly and yearly. However, a second problem inevitably follows this: Isn't economic poverty our current reality, and isn't excessive burden also the authorities' excuse? Then, shouldn't Koreans henceforth strive to increase financial resources while simultaneously implementing the burden of education expenses as an absolute duty, pouring all efforts into expanding educational institutions? Isn't this our <100> first and most urgent task? To promote this awakening, knowing the following requirements is most necessary.

A. Comparison of Educational Levels between Japanese and Koreans (Based on Public Elementary Schools)
Japanese Education (1919 Fiscal Year) [Table data missing in text, but described below]
Korean Education (1919 Fiscal Year) [Table data missing in text, but described below]

Comparing the above statistics roughly in the following three ways, the difference in levels is indeed not just any disparity.
(1) Ratio of Schools Possessed: Japanese, with a total of about 85,300 households, possessed 379 schools, reaching a ratio of one school per 225 households. However, Koreans, with a total of about 3.3 million households, possessed 482 schools, merely the lowest ratio of one school per 6,850 households.
(2) Ratio of Enrolled Children: Japanese, with a total population of about 312,500, had over 46,700 enrolled children, reaching an average of 15 per 100 people. However, Koreans, with a total population of about 16 million, had barely over 84,300 enrolled children, merely the lowest number ratio of 6 per 1,000 people.
(3) Ratio of School Expense Burden: The annual burden for Japanese reached over 1,00<101>6,260 *won*, amounting to an average of about 11 *won* 70 *chŏn* per household.
Koreans bore barely 497,700 *won*, amounting to the lowest burden of only 1 *won* 50 *chŏn* per household. [Note: There's a typo in the original, 11 won 50 cheon is written, but context and comparison suggests 1 won 50 cheon, as 11.50 would be similar to the Japanese burden per household, contradicting the "lowest burden" description. Assuming 1 won 50 cheon based on context.]

The above is generally based on the standards from three years prior. Although it is true that Korean educational thought has seen improvement beyond expectations in the subsequent three years, when viewed in comparative proportion to the counterpart, the difference in levels likely remains the same as yesterday and today. Then, no matter how high the zeal for learning has reached today, we cannot stop at satisfaction with this. Therefore, we must strive and endeavor further to extend our lifeline even more. This is the first thing we must awaken to today.

B. Awareness Regarding Korean Education Policy

Regarding the recent improvement of the Korean education system, the implementation of the co-education system (共學制度) as the first step of the so-called policy of impartial benevolence (一視同仁策) is truly welcomed wholeheartedly by us Koreans. However, concerning its implementation aspect, the difficult question for the authorities is whether it truly transcends the contradictory education system of the past and thoroughly realizes the spirit of being Korean-centered (朝鮮人 本位). Here, we present two or three questions about the past and present aspects of Korean education policy:

(1) The extreme imbalance in school allocation based on population ratio in the past, as shown by the example of elementary schools mentioned above, can perhaps be attributed to the issue of levels. However, regarding government-established middle-school level schools, irrespective of the population ratio of Japanese and Koreans, they have been established side-by-side (幷置) in equal proportion (seven Japanese middle schools, seven Korean government higher common schools) until today. Is this truly a spirit that views Koreans as the standard?
(2) Reclaiming the *hyanggyo* assets (鄕校財産, local Confucian school property) (annual income over 300,000 *won*) from elementary schools, on the one hand, stems from seeking the favor of stubborn Confucian scholars (儒生), but on the other hand, doesn't it contradict the authorities' stated intention that establishing schools is practically impossible for the time being, using the excuse of the people's excessive burden?
(3) Regarding the approval for establishing private middle schools, it is obstructed in many ways under the condition that it is practically impossible under the current situation. This can be well attested by the dispute over the location of Hongsŏng Higher Common School (洪城高普) and the rejection, five times with insufficient conditions, of the application for establishing T'ongyŏng Private Yugyŏng School (統營私立育英學校).
(4) Is the so-called co-education system (共學制) truly being realized sincerely? What indeed are the entrance results for Koreans in the seven middle schools throughout Korea? According to recent reports, only a minimal number—six at Kyŏngsŏng Middle School, and two each at Yongsan (龍山) and Wŏnsan (元山) Middle Schools—were admitted. While this can certainly be attributed to the issue of school academic levels, it is something that must be considered, like the grievances of the rejected (落訟者 稱怨 格).

It is impossible to enumerate one by one all the aspects within the Korean education issue that require our awakening, but promoting our awakening based on the conditions listed in items A and B above is deemed most appropriate. <102>

**Summary**

This 1922 editorial by Kim Pyŏngjun highlights the dramatic surge in Korean enthusiasm for education, contrasting it sharply with the apathy of just 10-15 years prior. This "astonishing zeal" leads to severe school entrance difficulties (入学難), particularly in Kyŏngsŏng, leaving thousands of children and youths unable to attend school. The author details temporary relief measures being attempted locally, such as two-shift systems and establishing special classes or private schools, but deems them insufficient stopgaps. Kim calls for a fundamental "awakening" among Koreans, urging them to recognize the inadequacy of colonial education provisions (like the "Three-Myŏn One-School" policy) and the vast disparity in resources and access compared to Japanese residents. He argues Koreans must prioritize funding education expansion as a matter of national survival, while also questioning the sincerity and fairness of colonial education policies, including the newly introduced co-education system and the obstruction of private Korean schools. For historians, this article is valuable as it captures the intense desire for modern education among Koreans in the early colonial period as a means of national advancement, documents grassroots responses to systemic limitations, provides statistical comparisons illustrating educational discrimination, and voices contemporary critiques of Japanese colonial education policy's structure and implementation.

新學年 入學難과 우리의 覺醒
						金秉濬
今年 新學期를 際하야 朝鮮人 學齡兒童의 入學難은 京城을 中心으로 하야 全鮮地方에 어느 곳이라 할 것 업시 다- 가티 부르짓게 됨은 一般 新聞紙上에셔 만히 보앗스려니와 結局 各 學校의 試驗期日이 次第로 經過하고 開學式이 順序로 열리게 되는 이에 마츰내 落第되어 눈물울 흘리며 집으로 도라가든지 中路에 彷徨하야 前途를 悲觀하는 靑年이 全鮮을 通하야 無慮 幾千幾萬에 達함은 今日 우리의 直接目睹한 悲極 慘極의 現狀이 아닌가 이에 朝鮮人된 우리의 處地에 잇서서 반듯이 徹底한 覺醒을 가지지 아니치 못할 것은 避치 못할 事實이라 이러한 意味 下에서 重複되나마 新聞紙上에 發表된 몃가지 事例에 記者의 感想을 附하야 一言을 陳述코져 하노라
一, 可驚할 朝鮮人의 向學熱
近來 우리 朝鮮사람의 向學熱은 果然 놀낼만한 일이다 京鄕을 勿論하고 急潮와 가티 沸騰되는 向學熱은 撞着되는 우리로 하야곰 沛然莫禦의 感이 업지 아니하도다
이에 吾人은 過去 十四五年 前 朝鮮人의 敎育狀況을 回顧치 아니치 못하겟다 過去의 狀況은 果然 어하던가? 卽 記者의 原籍地인 ○○郡의 當時 情況을 擧하야도 足히 全鮮을 推知할수- 잇다 처음 郡 私立으로 高等程度의 普通學校 一個所를 設立하고 每 五十戶 一人의 郡費生을 强制募集할새 各 面里에서는 所謂 敎育反對律(어느 法律에 잇는지)이라는 것을 두려워서 不得已 應募하되 該里 有力者 卽 所謂 班族의 子弟는 敢히 選拔치 못하고 오즉 最下級常民의 子弟만 起送하게 된지라 그럼으로 그 當選된 者의 父兄은 마치 그 子弟를 戰場에 赴하는 듯이 하야 含淚而送하기지에 至하엿스며 或은 應募치 못하는 洞里에서는 每 五十戶에 罰金 四十圓을 徵出하게 되엇는데 罰金만 바치고 生徒應募에 免하기만 하면 그에서 더-큰 榮光이 업는줄 알엇다 그리고 其後 各 面里 相當한 地點에 私立學校를 次第設置할새 그 學校 位置로 指定된 區域의 里民은 此를 排外하기 爲하야 百方으로 運動하엿다 이것이 곳 過去 敎育界의 狀況 中 一例이엇다 ○○＜97＞郡 아니라 全鮮 地方을 通하야 다-그러한 것은 勿論이거니와 特히 頑固學者의 中心地인 南鮮 地方의 敎育反對熱이 一層 尤甚한 것은 우리의 直接 經過한 事實이 證明하는 바이다 이와 가티 敎育熱이 薄弱하던 朝鮮人으로서 不過 十年의 短期間 卽 昨今 兩年 以來의 向學熱이 突然히 目下 現狀과 如한 潮流에 至함은 果然 可驚치 아닉치 못할 지로다 總戶數가 겨우 六千에 不過한 記者의 原籍地인 ○○郡과 가튼 最小地方으로도 現下 京城 留學生이 八十餘人이엇스며 其他 全鮮 各地 及 日本, 中國의 國外 留學生을 通하야 無慮 三百餘人(每 千戶 五十人 比例)에 達하엿도다 더욱 可驚可賀할 者는 가장 晩達되엇든 南鮮 地方의 向學熱이다 昨日과 如히 (非先王法言不敢道非先王法服不敢服)의 句語를 高調하던 儒敎學者의 門徒, 小華文物을 謳歌하며 漢官威儀를 夢想하던 頑固 兩班의 子弟들도 其 師門傳授의 切嚴한 戒律과 祖先 遺來의 因襲하던 舊慣미테서 飜然 改悟하야 反旗를 竪하고 一條生路를 求하야 頭를 學校의 門에 回케 됨은 實로 우리 朝鮮民族의 前途를 爲하야 手舞足蹈함을 마지 못하겟도다
이와 가티 全鮮 地方의 向學熱이 次第로 同一한 高度에 達한 結果 本年 新學期를 際하야 京城中等 程度의 七個 學校(普成, 中央, 徽文, 養正, 培材, 儆新, 東光)에서 二萬五千餘枚의 入學 志願書를 頒給한 空前의 現狀을 演出함에 至하엿스며 하서 海外 留學生의 數도(今年 一月부터 三月 二十日지 鍾路署에서만 내여준 旅行証明 統計表가 벌셔 一百五人)이라함에 依하야 逐年 增加함을 足히 証明할지로다
더욱이 四萬 以上의 學齡兒童을 有한 京城府民은 五百餘年 勝朝의 頑固한 舊慣에 浸潤하야 敎育熱이 比較的 薄弱하던바 近來에 突然히 向學熱이 熾盛하야 今年 新學期에 그 子弟를 公立普通學校에 入學시키랴고 京城府 民籍係에 民籍 對照의 証明을 受한 者-(三月 十五日지)二萬二千人 以上에서 結局 年齡制限에 依하야 五分之四는 除하고도 府內 十四 普校에 志願書 提出한 者- 四千八百五人의 多에 至하엿도다
그러면 이와 가티 非常한 高度에 達한 向學熱은 果然 어한 動機에서 出함인가? 或 瞎馬聞鈴 格이나 아닌가? 此에 반듯이 한번 硏究할 必要가 업지 아니하도다 果然이다 今日 우리의 一條 活路는 果然 敎育이란 그것의 外에 다시 求할 곳이 업도다 目下 科學知識에 落伍者-된 우리, 生存競爭에 劣敗者-된 우리로서 장차 漠然한 우리의 生活前路를 開拓하야 남과 가티 살자면 반듯이 납과 가티 알아야 할 것이며 남과 가티 알랴면 반듯이＜98＞ 남과 가티 배워야 하겟다는 것이 今日 우리 朝鮮人의 向學熱을 挑發케 한 原動力이 된 것이다 이에 朝鮮人된 우리는 各其 自己의 死活問題를 圓滿히 解決하랴면 이 急潮와 가티 沸騰되는 向學熱을 遺憾 엄시 順應함에 잇나니 그 順應策은 果然 어할가!
二, 入學難의 救急策
上述함과 如히 朝鮮人의 向學熱이 逐年 激增함은 누구를 勿論하고 可驚可賀할 者임은 多言을 不俟할 것이어니와 結局 收容無處로 四五倍 或 六七倍 以上의 未入學者를 出케 됨은 果然 目不忍見의 慘狀이 아닌가! 玆에 記者의 目擊한 바 京城 一部의 實例를 擧하야 足히써 全鮮의 現狀을 推想할지로다 京城 各 中等學校의 入學願書頒給數-二萬五千餘枚와 各 普通學校의 學齡兒童民籍 對照數-二萬二千餘度의 數字는 여러 가지 原因으로 爽實에 歸한다 할지라도 畢竟 各 學校 定員(七個 中等學校 約 一千三百餘人, 十四個 普通學校 二千二百五十九人) 以外의 不合格者, 當初 年齡制限(普通學校 滿 六歲 以上 十一歲 以下, 中等學校 十一歲 以上 十六歲 以下)에 依하야 出願치 못한 者를 並하야 約 萬名 以上의 敎育 失望者를 生함은 今日지의 經過한 事實이다 以上의 悲極 慘極의 現狀을 直接 目睹한 社會有志 及 學父兄 諸氏는 此를 黙然看過키 不能함으로 目下 入學難救急會를 發起하야 善後策을 硏究한 結果 臨時 應急手段으로 各 町洞 代表로 하야금 府內 十四個 公立普通學校에 對하야 二部 敎授制를 實施하야 未入學 兒童을 救濟하여 달라는 陳情書를 提出하야 圓滿한 解決을 期待하는 中이며 하서 各 地方에서도 同樣의 救急策을 硏究 進行 中인데 그 新聞紙上에 現한 바를 依하면
羣山公立普通學校에서는 今船 落第 歸家하는 兒童을 爲하야 例外로 特別科를 置하야 擧皆收容하게 된다 하며
靑陽公立普通學校에서는 收容定員 外 一百七十餘名의 不合格 兒童 中 結局 百餘名은 年齡制限에 依하여 就學치 못하엿스나 其餘 七十餘人은 特別班을 置하야 收容한다 하며
宣川公立普通學校에서는 校舍 不足으로 十歲 以上 兒童 二百餘人의 入學치 못함에 對하야 學父兄 諸氏는 救濟策을 討議한 結果 一私立學校를 從速 設立하기로 計劃 中이라 하며
麗水公立普通學校에서는 今船 不就學 兒童 二百餘人을 救濟하기 爲하야 當地 靑年會에서는 地方有志 及 學＜99＞父兄으로 더불어 救濟會를 組織하고 左의 事項(一, 普校 入學者 外 全部를 收容 敎授할 일 二, 經費는 救濟會員된 學父兄 及 有志의 會費 及 靑年會의 負擔으로 할 일 三, 敎室은 普通學校 附屬 水産學校 舊校舍를 借用할 일 四, 敎員은 道知事에게 申請하야 中學校 出身을 聘用할 일 五, 程度는 公立普通學校와 同一케 할 일)을 議決하엿다 함
以上은 京鄕을 通하야 普通學校 程度의 學齡兒童에 對한 救濟策이라 할지며 其外 中等 程度의 未入學 靑年에 對하야도 現下 京城 敎育界의 有志 諸氏는 此를 切實히 感하야 一時 彌縫之策이나마 各種의 講習所를 多數 設立하야 此의 救濟에 汲汲하엿스나 不合格者의 全部를 遺憾업시 收容할 수 업는 것은 事實이며 設或 收容한다 할지라도 우리의 前路 開拓者인 靑年으로 하야금 이와 가티 不完全한 敎育을 밧게 함은 어 今日 處地에 잇는 우리의 恬然視之할 바이리오
그러나 今日 우리의 程度에 잇서서 急遽히 圓滿한 解決을 엇기는 到底 不能인 故로 記者는 地方 敎育界 有志 諸氏와 밋 學齡兒童을 有한 學父兄 여러분 向하야 不完全하나마 以上 諸方의 救濟策 中에서 各其 地方情形에 適宜한 一策을 取하야 前述洋洋한 學齡兒童으로 하야금 敎育失時의 嘆이 無케 하기를 바라노라 이것이 곳 記者가 新聞紙에 發表된 重複의 嫌을 不避하고 呶呶히 一言을 提供하는 바이로다
三, 우리의 覺醒할 일
所謂 可驚할 向學熱이라 함은 오즉 朝鮮人의 今日 程度에만 限한 말이오 決코 이것만으로써 將來의 滿足이라 할 수 업는 것이다 少하야도 一百七十餘萬의 學齡兒童을 有하다는 朝鮮으로서 어 이에 滿足타 하리오 장차 時代의 思潮에 伴하야 入學兒童의 逐年 增加될 것은 避치 못할 事實인즉 이에 對한 順應策은 今後 우리의 徹底한 覺醒을 要치 아니치 못 할지로다
所謂 塞責에 지내지 못하는 當局의 主張하는 바의 三面 一校制가 어 우리의 敎育前途에 滿足을 興하리오 少하야도 一面一校 卽 二千二百餘校의 配置가 아니면 到底히 月加歲增하는 우리의 向學心을 順應할 수 업슬 것이다. 그러나 이에는 반듯이 第二問題가 隨하나니 卽 經濟貧乏이 目下 우리의 現狀이 아니며 負擔過重이 한 當局의 口實이 아닌가! 그러면 今後의 朝鮮人은 반듯이 財源의 增殖을 務圖하는 同時 敎育費의 負擔을 絶對의 義務로 實行하야 敎育機關 擴張에 全力을 傾함이 우리의 第＜100＞一 急先務가 아닌가! 此의 覺醒을 促함에는 반듯이 左의 要件을 知함이 가장 必要하다 하노라
甲, 日鮮人 敎育程度의 比例(但 公立普通學校를 表準함)
日本人 敎育(大正 八年度)

朝鮮人 敎育(大正 八年度)

以上의 統計表를 大略 左의 三種으로 對照하야보면 그 程度의 差異가 果然 如干한 懸隔이 아니다
(1) 所持學校의 比例 日本人 總戶數- 約 八萬五千三百餘戶에 三百七十九個의 學校를 所持하엿나니 卽 二百二十五戶 每 一校의 比例에 達하엿스나 朝鮮人은 總戶數- 約 三百三十餘萬戶에 所持學校 四百八十二個 卽 六千八百五十戶 每 一校의 最少比例에 不過하며
(2) 就學兒童의 比例 日本人은 總人口- 約 三十一萬二千五百餘人에 四萬六千七百餘名의 就學兒童을 有하엿나니 卽 百名 每 十五人 平均에 至하엿스나 朝鮮人은 總人口- 約 一千六百餘萬人에 겨우 八萬四千三百餘名의 就學兒童 卽 千名 每 六人 比例의 最少數에 不過하며
(3) 學校費 負擔의 比例 日本人의 負擔 年額은 百萬＜101＞六千二百六十餘圓 即 每戶 平均 十一圓 七十錢 假量에 至하엿스나
朝鮮人은 겨우 四十九萬七千七百餘圓 即 每戶 平均 十一圓 五十錢의 最低 負擔에 不過하다
以上은 大槪 三年 以前의 程度를 表準함이다 以後 三年間 朝鮮人의 敎育思想이 勿論 豫想 以外의 向上을 見함은 事實이나 亦 相對方의 平比例로 見하면 程度의 差異는 依然히 昨今 一般일 것이다 그러면 今日의 向學熱이 아모리 高度에 達하엿다 할지라도 此로써 滿足에 止할 수 엄슨즉 이에 더욱 奮鬪 努力하야 우리의 生命線을 더욱 延長치 아니치 못할지니 이것이 곳 今日 우리의 覺醒할 바의 一이오
乙, 朝鮮敎育政策에 對한 覺悟
今般 朝鮮敎育制度의 改善에 就하야 所謂 一視同仁策의 第一步로 共學制度를 實施한다 함은 朝鮮人된 우리로써 實로 滿心 歡迎함을 마지 안니한다 그러나 그 實行方面에 就하야는 果然 從來의 矛盾된 敎育制度를 超越하야 朝鮮人 本位의 精神을 徹底히 實現하는가 함이 곳 當局에 對한 難解의 疑問이다 玆에 吾人은 朝鮮敎育政策의 昔今 一班에 對한 疑問의 二三을 示하면
(1) 從來의 學校配置가 頭數 比例 上 넘우 不均等함은 上述한 普通學校 例에 依하야 아즉 程度問題에 付할지나 官立中等 程度의 學校로 말하면 日鮮人의 頭數比例를 不拘하고 今日지 兩方의 平比例(日本人 中學校 七, 朝鮮人 官立高等學校 七)로 幷置하여 왓나니 이것이 果然 朝鮮人을 本位視한 精神인가
(2) 從來의 鄕校財産(每年收入 三十餘萬圓)을 普通學校로부터 奪還함은 一方으로 頑固 儒生의 歡心을 엇고자 함에서 出함이나 一方으로는 人民의 負擔過重을 口實로 하야 當分間 學校의 設立은 殆히 不可能이라는 當局의 主張하는 本意에는 矛盾이 되지 아니하는가!
(3) 私立中等學校의 設立認可에 對하야 現狀으로는 殆히 不可能이라는 條件 下에서 多方으로 阻止하나니 此는 洪城高普 位置의 紛糾問題와 統營私立育英學校의 設立認可 申請을 不充分한 條件으로 五回나 却下함에 可히 證할 것이며
(4) 所謂 共學制는 果然 誠心으로 實現되는가 함이니 卽 全鮮 七個 中學校의 朝鮮人에 對한 入學成績이 果然 어한가? 最近의 聞한 바에 依하면 京城中學校에 六人 龍山 及 元山中學校에 各 二人의 最少數에 止하엿다하니 此는 勿論 學校力 程度의 問題에 付할지나 所謂 落訟者 稱怨 格으로 한번 思考치 아니치 못할 바이다
朝鮮敎育問題의 裏面에 들어가 우리의 覺醒할바를 一一 枚擧키 不能하나 오즉 以上 列擧한 甲乙 二項의 諸 條件에 依하야 우리의 覺醒을 促함이 가장 適切하다 하노라＜102＞
