**Summary**

This short notice lists the staff members and their positions at the newly established Sinuiju branch office of the magazine *Kaebyŏk* (개벽, 開闢) as of May 1922. It details the Branch Manager, individuals responsible for General Affairs, Reporting, Accounting, and External Affairs. For colonial history, this notice is interesting as it documents the expansion of *Kaebyŏk*'s organizational network into a key border city, Sinuiju, highlighting the magazine's reach and activities. The duplication of names across different roles (Yi Yong-sŏk and Song Kwanch'ŏl) might suggest the limited resources or the multitasking nature required in such colonial-era ventures.
