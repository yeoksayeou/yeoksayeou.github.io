Silla's Painting God = Master Solgŏ / Introduction to Ten Great Figures, Part Ten
						One Reporter

Though our history is said to be four thousand years long, there are no records that fully show the life of those four thousand years. Moreover, the misguided minds possessed by historians through the ages, even when recording the same historical facts, gladly took up their brushes for events like political gains and losses or the rise and fall of royal houses, but they paid little attention to the cultural aspects—especially the artistic aspects—which better explain the life and thought of the people at the time. Now, as I attempt to introduce the entirety of Master Solgŏ, thoughts on this deepen anew. Even researching all available literature, it is impossible to find out everything. Amidst this, because the Master's family lineage was humble and also because his craft was painting, not calligraphy, his traces have been even less transmitted.

According to history, the Master was a person from the time of King Chinhŭng of Silla (over 1,300 years ago). His family lineage was exceedingly humble, and the family barely managed their livelihood by engaging in agriculture. It is also a fact that the Master likely did not receive what could be called a formal education.
Genius is not necessarily something achieved through learning; the Master's genius for painting was greatly perfected through self-painting and self-critique. According to tradition, from his childhood, the Master devoted his entire spirit to painting. When he went up the mountain to gather firewood, he would draw on rocks with burnt C<em>hudrania tricuspidata</em> roots (츩리), and when he went down to the fields to weed, he would draw on the sand with the tip of his hoe. It is said that he was frequently driven out to the wilderness due to his parents' anger, stemming from the accusation that he did not focus on farming, the family's main occupation.
Though he was so passionate about drawing, his place of residence was a remote countryside,<82> and there was no master to teach him the art. Concerned about this, the Master prayed wholeheartedly day and night to the heavenly god (天神), wishing to receive divine instruction, and he continued this for several years.
Sincerity moves heaven. One day, while the Master was up the mountain gathering firewood and resting on a rock, in a state between dream and reality, an old man suddenly appeared and instructed him:
"I am the divine man Tan'gun (檀君). Moved by your utmost sincerity, I now imbue your brush with divine will. Receive it and use it, and there will be proof of its power."
After receiving the above dream instruction, the Master's brushwork suddenly entered the realm of the divine, and he truly became a master painter for all ages. Perhaps because the Master was so engrossed in drawing with no other thoughts, he came to have a daydream, and his long-held admiration for the ancestor god Tan'gun resulted in the manifestation of the old man in his dream.

As Buddhism began to spread to Silla, both King Pŏphŭng and King Chinhŭng became particularly devout believers, establishing famous temples and great monasteries everywhere. Among these, Hwangnyongsa Temple in Kyŏngju, completed in the Pyŏngsul year (丙戌), the 27th year of King Chinhŭng's reign, was truly the greatest among great monasteries. Gold and bronze from all under heaven were gathered to cast the Buddha statue, and all the world's skills were employed to adorn its halls and pavilions. The Master's divine brush became known to the royal court, and he was commissioned to paint a portion of the murals for that temple. The lifelike quality of the old pine tree he painted on the wall, which even deceived birds, falcons, and swallows, creating an unprecedented miracle unheard of before or since, is something the world knows. However, it is regrettable that the ancient Hwangnyongsa Temple has long since fallen into ruin, and the few remaining foundation stones, located a few *majŏng* (馬丁) east of Kyŏngju, meaninglessly disturb the thoughts of passersby.
The Master's brushwork was not limited to the murals of Hwangnyongsa Temple. Looking only at what appears in historical records (史記), the Guanyin Bodhisattva (觀音菩薩) at Punhwangsa Temple in Kyŏngju and the Vimalakirti image (維摩像) at Tansoksa Temple in Chinju are also said to be his works, but today, these too cannot be found. Similarly, the portrait of the divine ancestor Tan'gun (檀君神祖 御眞) created by the Master's hand is said to have been passed down until the Koryŏ period, but there is also no way to verify this.

One cannot force oneself to write about what cannot be investigated. Finally, I wish to append a few lines of records concerning the Master's deeds to serve as a reference for the reader.

Solgŏ was a Silla person. His origins were humble, so his lineage is not recorded. He was skilled at painting from birth. He once painted an old pine tree on the wall of Hwangnyongsa Temple. The trunk's texture was scaly and wrinkled, the branches and leaves coiled and bent. Birds, falcons, and swallows often flew towards it, mistaking it for real, and upon arrival, stumbled and fell. As years passed and the colors faded, the temple monks restored it with mineral pigments (丹靑), but the birds no longer came. Also, the Guanyin Bodhisattva at Punhwangsa Temple in Kyŏngju and <83> the Vimalakirti image at Tansoksa Temple in Chinju are all his brushwork. The world praised them as divine paintings.

When Hwangnyongsa Temple of Silla was completed, there was one Solgŏ, who painted an old pine tree on the wall. The trunk's texture was scaly and wrinkled, the branches and leaves coiled and bent. Birds often flew towards it, mistaking it for real, and upon arrival, stumbled and fell. As years passed and the colors faded, the temple monks restored it with mineral pigments (丹靑), but the birds no longer came. Also, the Buddha images at Punhwangsa Temple and Tansoksa Temple are all Solgŏ's handiwork. The world called them divine paintings.
(Above from *Tongguk T'onggam*)

Solgŏ of Silla was the son of a farming family. From a young age, he set his mind on painting. When gathering firewood, he would draw on rocks with kudzu roots (葛根), and when plowing, he would draw in the sand with the tip of his plowshare (鋤尖). Living in a remote region without a teacher, he ultimately could not achieve proficiency. Solgŏ prayed wholeheartedly day and night to the heavenly god (天神), wishing to receive divine instruction. After doing this for years, one day an old man appeared to him in a dream, saying, "I am the divine man Tan'gun (檀君). Moved by your sincerity, I bestow upon you a divine brush (神毫)." Upon waking, he was恍然 (startled/aware). He finally became a famous artisan. Solgŏ, deeply grateful for the divine grace, painted nearly a thousand portraits of Tan'gun (檀君御眞), presumably based on what he saw in his dream. Yi Kyubo of Koryŏ, in his inscription for a portrait of Tan'gun painted by Solgŏ, praised it, saying: "In every house beyond the mountain passes, the divine ancestor is revered (家家神祖傷); back then, half [of such portraits] came from this famous artisan."
(Above from *Tongsa Yugo*) (*Translator note: 東事類考 is likely a typo for 東史類考 or similar, possibly referring to Yi Kyubo's writings or related collections. The quote itself is attributed to Yi Kyubo.*)

In the time of King Chinhŭng of Silla, one Solgŏ painted an old pine tree on the wall of Hwangnyongsa Temple, and it is said that birds often flew into it. Perhaps his painting entered the realm of the divine. How could it be that only calligraphy had Kim Saeng (金生)? It is regrettable that his name is not renowned in later generations. Some say Solgŏ was the name of a monk.
(Above from *Chibong Yusŏl*)

A miscellaneous poem on Tonggyŏng (東京雜詠) says: "What does it matter that Solgŏ came from humble origins? The state history still transmits the wonders of the Six Laws (六法奇). His marvelous skill allowed no other hand for restoration; the old pine branch on Hwangnyongsa's wall."
(Above from *Kohwan Tangjip*)

Postscript: Reporter's Note: The introduction of Chosŏn's Ten Great Figures concludes with this issue. Although I tried my best, the result did not quite meet expectations. What is particularly regrettable is that while this introduction of great figures was already underway, readers who cherish this magazine sometimes requested previous issues featuring earlier introductions, but we could not fulfill these requests due to the earlier issues being out of print. Inevitably, our company plans to revise and supplement the points lacking in the introduction of the Ten Great Figures, and also compile the many other great figures featured in this magazine besides Kim Okkyun, publishing them as a separate volume. By doing so, we aim to fulfill our responsibility regarding the inadequacy of the introductions, while also aligning with the humble intention our company initially conceived.<84>

**Summary**

This 1922 article from *Kaebyŏk* magazine introduces Solgŏ, a legendary painter from the Silla Kingdom (specifically King Chinhŭng's reign, c. 6th century), as the tenth figure in a series on "Ten Great Figures." The author laments the lack of historical records about cultural figures like Solgŏ, especially compared to political events, attributing this scarcity partly to Solgŏ's humble origins and his profession as a painter rather than a scholar. The article recounts the legend of Solgŏ's innate talent, his passion for drawing from childhood despite parental disapproval, and his eventual attainment of divine skill after receiving a magic brush from the spirit of Tan'gun in a dream. His most famous works, including the lifelike pine tree mural at Hwangnyongsa Temple (which supposedly fooled birds), the Guanyin image at Punhwangsa, the Vimalakirti image at Tansoksa, and portraits of Tan'gun, are mentioned, though the author notes none survive. The article includes excerpts from historical texts like the *Samguk Sagi* and *Tongguk T'onggam* referencing Solgŏ. A postscript mentions plans to publish a separate volume compiling the profiles of these ten figures and others.

From a colonial history perspective, the article is interesting for several reasons. First, its focus on pre-modern Korean cultural heroes like Solgŏ reflects a nationalist sentiment common during the Japanese occupation, emphasizing Korea's long and independent cultural heritage. The specific inclusion of the Tan'gun myth, positioning the legendary founder of Korea as the source of Solgŏ's divine artistic inspiration, strongly reinforces this national identity narrative. Second, the lamentation over lost records and artworks (like the Hwangnyongsa mural) could implicitly comment on the vulnerability and loss of Korean cultural heritage, a sensitive issue during a period of foreign domination. Finally, the postscript about compiling these biographies into a book highlights the effort to disseminate knowledge about Korean history and culture to the public, potentially as a form of cultural resistance or preservation.

新羅의 畫神 = 率去先生/十大偉人 紹介의 其十
						一記者
우리의 歷史가 四千年이라 하나 그 四千年間의 生活을 온전히 보여준 紀錄이 업도다 더욱이 歷代史家의 가진 그릇된 머리는 가튼 史實을 記錄함에도 政治의 得失, 王家의 興替와 가튼 事件에 對하야는 欣然히 붓을 내리웟스나 그보다도 더 當時 人間의 生活, 思想의 如何를 說明하는 文化 方面- 中에도 藝術 方面에 對하야는 別로 을 부티지 아니하얏다 이제 率居先生의 全般을 紹介하려 하니 이에 對한 생각이 새삼스럽게 깁허진다 모든 文獻을 攷究할지라도 알아내일 수가 업도다 그런 中에도 先生은 그 家系가 寒微하고  그 所工이 글씨도 아니요 그림인 點에서 其蹟이 더욱 傳치 못하얏다

史에 依하면 先生은 新羅 眞興王 時(巨金 一千三百 餘年 前)의 人으로 그 家系가 甚히 寒微하얏스며 家庭에서는 農業을 營하야 겨우 生計를 圖하엿슬 인 바 先生은 別로 이것이라 할 敎育을 밧지 못하엿슬 것도 事實이다
天才란 반듯이 배워서 되는 것이 아니라 그림에 對한 先生의 天才는 自畵自評의 中에서 스스로 大成되엇다 傳에 依하면 先生은 幼詩로부터 一段 精神을 그림에 두어써 山에 올라 섭을 캐면 츩리로써 바위 우에 그림을 그리고 들에 내려 풀을 맬 에는 호미 으로써 모새 우에 그림을 그렷는데 로는 그집의 本業인 農事에 專心치 아니한다는 嫌으로 父母의 怒를 입어 曠野로 逐出된지가 屢次이엇다 한다
이와 가티 劃畵에 熱心하나 그의 所居處가 僻鄕인바＜82＞ 그 道를 敎授할 師長이 업섯슴으로 先生은 이를 慮하야 晝夜로 天神 心祝하야 神敎를 밧기를 願하되 이와 가티 하기를 무릇 數年을 行하얏다
至誠은 感天이라 先生이 하루는 山에 올라 섭을 캐며 岩上에서 쉬일제 非夢似夢間에 문득 一位老人이 나타나며 가르되
「나는 神人 檀君이라 너의 至誠에 感激하야 이제 너의 붓에 神意를 부려주노니 바다써 使用하면 스스로 徵驗되는바- 잇스리라」
右의 夢敎를 바든 以後로 先生의 彩筆이 문득 神에 入하야 實로 萬世의 畵師가 되엇다 하니 盖先生이 劃畵에 專心하야 餘念이 업섯든 것은 스스로 白晝에 을 엇게 되엇스며 平素부터 檀君祖神을 慕仰한 結果는 夢中의 老人으로 現顯된 것이엇다

佛法이 비롯오 新羅에 通하며 法興·眞興의 兩 王이 別로 佛法을 酷信하야 名寺 巨刹을 處處에 세우는 中 眞興王 二十七年 丙戌에 落成된 慶州의 黃龍寺와 가튼 것은 實로 巨刹 中의 巨刹이엇다 天下의 金과 銅을 모아써 佛像을 지으며 天下의 技巧를 다하야써 그 殿閣을 밀새 先生의 神筆이 朝廷에 알린바 되어 該寺에 對한 壁畵의 一部를 그리게 되엇섯다 그 壁에 그린 老松의 精彩가 鳥雀鳶燕에게지 미처 今不聞 古不聞의 奇蹟을 나타내인 일은 世上이 다 아는 바이거니와 可惜한 일은 黃龍의 古寺도 頹廢된지 已久하야 慶州의 東數馬丁許에 잇는 二三의 殘礎가 속절 업시 過客의 心思를 散亂케 하는 그것이다
先生의 筆蹟은 오즉 黃龍寺의 壁畵에 아니라 史記에 나타난 것만으로 볼지라도 慶州 芬皇寺의 觀音菩薩과 晋州 斷俗寺의 維摩像이 다- 그의 筆이라 하나 今日에 잇서는 한 어더볼 수가 업스며 先生의 손에 이뤄진 檀君神祖의 御眞은 高麗時代에지 遺傳되엇슴과 가트나 이 한 可攷할 길이 업도다

想攷할 수 업는 것을 억지로 쓸 수는 업도다 마즈막으로 先生의 事蹟에 關한 몃 줄의 넷 記錄을 附記하야써 讀者의 參考에 供코저 한다
