◎ Apology

**Summary**

The editorial department of Kaebyŏk magazine apologizes to readers because an article titled "Research on the Life Problems of Koreans" could not be included in the current issue (No. 23, May 1, 1922) due to unspecified "circumstances" involving the author. They promise the article will begin its run in the next issue. This notice offers a small glimpse into the practical challenges of publishing, including potential author issues or external pressures, faced by a significant Korean cultural and intellectual magazine during the colonial period. Historians might find it interesting as evidence of the difficulties in maintaining consistent content production under colonial rule, hinting at potential sensitivities around topics like "Korean life problems" or simply the precariousness of intellectual work at the time.
