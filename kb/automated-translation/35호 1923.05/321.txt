**Summary**

This announcement details the establishment of a new branch office for the Gaebyeok magazine in Kunsan. It lists the branch's official name, its jurisdictional area (Okku County), its location within Kunsan Prefecture (Taejŏng-dong), and the names and positions of its staff members, including the branch manager, advisors, and a general affairs/reporter. The announcement instructs residents within the branch's area to direct all magazine-related business, such as subscriptions and advertising requests, to this new office. From a historical perspective, this notice is significant as it demonstrates the organizational expansion and regional outreach efforts of a major Korean cultural magazine during the Japanese colonial period. The establishment of local branches like this suggests Gaebyeok's growing readership and influence, requiring a decentralized structure to manage subscriptions and business activities despite the likely challenges of colonial administration and censorship.
