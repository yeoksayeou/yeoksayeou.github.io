謝告 (Apology Notice)

Regarding Chapter 2, Section "4" (page 80) of the main topic in this magazine's previous issue, there were 7 or 8 lines remaining after "그리면" [geurimyeon - If so/Then] at the end, which depicted 그대로 [godaero - exactly as it is] the way the flame of love begins to burn. Due to constraints of page count and line count, we were unable to include them properly, creating something like tweezers with their tail cut off [i.e., an incomplete piece]. The printer extends apologies (未安한 말씀) to the author and readers for this and dares to hope for your forgiveness. <131>

**Summary**

This short notice is an apology from the publisher or printer of the magazine *Kaebyŏk* (개벽) to its readers and the author of a piece in the previous issue. Due to space limitations (page and line counts), the final few lines depicting the "start of the flame of love" in Chapter 2, Section 4 of the main article were omitted, leaving the piece incomplete. The publisher expresses regret and asks for forgiveness. For historians, this piece offers a small glimpse into the practical constraints and editorial processes of magazine publishing in 1920s colonial Korea. It highlights the negotiation between content length and physical printing limitations, and the direct communication style between publishers and their audience regarding editorial errors or omissions.
