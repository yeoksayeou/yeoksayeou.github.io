**Body Text Translation:**
One Who Had 515 Children

The polygamy of the Siamese (暹羅) Royal Family is truly world-renowned; the previous king before the current king truly had 1,000 queens and concubines. Because of having so many wives like this, it was common to have forty princes, but the current king's grandfather had 86 children, and the current king's great-grandfather is said to have had 200 sons and 315 daughters, totaling 515 children. However, in this country, the entire populace inherently enjoys female company, and it is said that all they do after eating is womanizing; the people's faces are yellow and their backs are bent. Among them, women from common families, or their parents, consider becoming a consort of the Royal Family the greatest honor and compete to become one. The current king, having studied abroad early on, recognized the evil custom of royal polygamy and was determined not to take any other wife besides one, but public resentment soared, and it seems he unavoidably took several dozen women already. <26>

**Summary**

This article reports on the extensive polygamy within the Siamese (Thai) royal family, noting the previous king had 1,000 consorts and the current king's great-grandfather fathered 515 children. It contrasts this tradition with the current king's Western-influenced desire for monogamy, which reportedly faces popular opposition rooted in the societal acceptance of polygamy and the perceived honor of becoming a royal consort. The text also includes stereotypical descriptions of the Siamese people. For historians studying Korean colonial history, the article offers a glimpse into how Koreans perceived other Asian nations and customs during this period, potentially reflecting contemporary biases, fascination with the 'exotic', or comparisons (implicit or explicit) with their own societal norms under Japanese rule. The critical yet matter-of-fact tone regarding Siamese practices like polygamy and "womanizing," alongside physical descriptions, is noteworthy.
