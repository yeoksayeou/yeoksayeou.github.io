The Past and Present of the Educational World, a Mixture of Joy and Sorrow

1. The Origins of New Education in Chosŏn
As we all know, the previous educational system of our Chosŏn maintained the Sŏnggyun'gwan and the Four Schools (Sahak: East, West, South, Central) in Kyŏngsŏng, placed Hyanggyo (county schools) in each prefecture and county, and Sŏdang (village schools) in each village and hamlet. The general sequence was to enter the Hyanggyo from the Sŏdang, the Sahak from the Hyanggyo, and from the Sahak again into the Sŏnggyun'gwan to learn the highest level of scholarship. As the times changed, the civil service examination system (Kwagŏ) was abolished at the end of the 502nd year of the Founding [of the Joseon Dynasty, i.e., 1894], and in the following year, Ŭlmi [1895], the government of the time (the Kim Hong-jip cabinet), along with reforming general national administration, established a new educational system, founding elementary schools, middle schools, normal schools, foreign language schools, and other schools. This was the beginning of Chosŏn's new education and, at the same time, a pivotal moment marking a major transformation in national thought. However, the people of the time did not understand this school education well, and the government authorities, changing day and night, also lacked the sincerity to operate it, so it did not see particular dissemination. Then, during the Russo-Japanese War (Illo Chŏnyŏk) period of Kwangmu 8-9 [1904-1905], as the fate of the peninsula was becoming precarious, it experienced rapid development like a swift wind and sudden thunder (Indeed, looking at the educational world around the 4th year of Yung'hŭi [1910], just before the annexation, excluding government and public schools such as common schools, high schools, foreign language schools, higher girls' schools, and vocational schools, there were over 2,000 private schools established purely by the private sector – showing an average of about one school per *myŏn* [township]. This allows us to gauge how vigorous the trend of new education was at the time). But the time was already late, and the newly burgeoning national education, despite its flourishing, could not save the great house from its final collapse.

2. Abolition and Reform of the Educational Origins!
When Japan and Korea merged in the 4th year of Yung'hŭi [1910] and the Government-General of Chosŏn was established, among the immediate overhaul of all systems, the education system, in particular, was deemed a fundamental issue that could not be established lightly. <51> After agonizing over it for a full year, the Chosŏn Education Ordinance (朝鮮敎育令) was announced in August of the following year [1911], and the ordinances for various schools and miscellaneous regulations were announced in October of the same year, to be implemented from November. With this, the independent origins of Chosŏn education were severed, and a new origin of Japanese-made education, aimed at fostering loyal subjects for the Great Japanese Empire (大日本帝國), replaced it.
According to the explicit statements of the Government-General authorities at the time, "The education of Koreans from now on, based on the Imperial Rescript on Education (敎育勅語), takes fostering loyal subjects as its fundamental principle, exerting effort in the cultivation of virtue (德性) and the dissemination of the Japanese language, imparting knowledge and skills essential for daily life, and striving to simplify the school system and standards." To rephrase this once more: The education of Koreans from now on has its fundamental principle in remodeling the thoughts and feelings of existing Chosŏn people to assimilate them into purely Japanese people. Special emphasis is placed on cultivating subservience (the character to obediently follow the rule of the Government-General – officially mandated virtue) and the study of the Japanese language. On the other hand, it provides the knowledge and skills suitable for becoming clerks in *myŏn*, *pu*, *kun*, *to*, and courts, industrial technicians, common school teachers, medical practitioners, and other subordinate staff in government/public offices and companies. Accordingly, the school system and standards are made extremely simple, establishing 4-year common schools, 4-year boys' higher common schools, 3-year girls' higher common schools, and a few specialized schools (專修學校) as the highest institutions. As for vocational education institutions, simple agriculture, simple industry, simple commerce, and simple fisheries schools were established, focusing solely on the four characters "simple and basic" (簡易卑近). Except for a few independent schools, all were attached to public common schools.
The authorities, who would only smile with determination after picking up and eating even a fallen grain of rice themselves, separately enacted the Private School Regulations (私立學校規則) in March of Taishō 4 [1915]. This required private schools wishing to provide general education, vocational education, or specialized education to determine their respective curricula according to the regulations concerning the corresponding government/public schools and also stipulated the qualifications for their teachers. As a result, private schools thereafter had no choice but to either voluntarily change their structure to become common schools or higher common schools, or else close their doors – they were forced to choose one of the two. In this way, purely private schools were essentially completely annihilated (全滅).

3. One Student per 12 Households
After several years passed like this, looking into the Chosŏn educational world as of the summer of Taishō 7 [1918] (the year before Kim'i [1919]), throughout all of Chosŏn, there were 462 common schools with over 87,000 students. There were 6 government higher common schools (one each in Kyŏngsŏng, P'yŏngyang, Taegu, Hamhŭng, plus one girls' higher common school each in Kyŏngsŏng and P'yŏngyang) with over 2,100 students. There were 10 private higher common schools (Yangjŏng, Paejae, Posŏng, Hwimun, Sungmyŏng, Chinmyŏng in Kyŏngsŏng; Hosudon, <52> Songdo in Kaesŏng; Kwangsŏng in P'yŏngyang; Tongnae High Common School in Tongnae, etc.) with over 2,000 students. There were 88 vocational schools (agriculture, commerce, industry, fisheries as of October of the same year) with over 3,900 students. For specialized schools, there were 4 government schools (Kyŏngsŏng Specialized School [likely Kyŏngsŏng Pŏphak Chŏnmun Hakkyo, Law School], Kyŏngsŏng Medical Specialized School [Kyŏngsŏng Ŭijŏn], Kyŏngsŏng Technical Specialized School [Kyŏngsŏng Kongjŏn], Suwŏn Agriculture and Forestry Specialized School) with over 500 students, and 3 private schools (Yŏnhŭi, Severance [세부란스], Posŏng Specialized School) with over 200 students. Besides these, as of the end of June of the same year, there were 809 other private schools counting over 100,000 students.
Summing the above, in Taishō 7, the total number of schools in Chosŏn for the education of Koreans was 1,382, with approximately 200,000 students. Comparing this to the number of Korean households at the end of the same year, which was over 3,139,000 (population over 16,697,000), it calculates to approximately one student sent out per 12 households.

1. Revision of the Education System
March of Taishō 8 [1919] passed. An indescribable change occurred in the thoughts and feelings of the Chosŏn people, and when this change manifested in the educational sphere, it became a passion for learning, summarized as "We must first know." From Sŏdang and lecture centers (講習所) to elementary schools, middle schools, and specialized schools, everywhere burst with people wanting to learn. Even the new authorities of the Government-General, who proclaimed a so-called "Cultural Policy," could not resist the tide of the situation and decided to revise the existing educational policy somewhat. In November of Taishō 9 [1920], they first stipulated that the common school term (previously 4 years) would be 6 years in principle, and that a supplementary course (補習科) of up to 2 years could be added to higher common schools. Then, in February of Taishō 11 [1922], the Chosŏn Education Ordinance was promulgated again, implementing revisions across the entire school system. Concurrently, new regulations were established for Government-General schools, public school ordinances (for Japanese), common schools, higher common schools, and girls' higher common schools. Also, it was stipulated that in special circumstances, Koreans could enter elementary schools (小学校), middle schools (中学校), and higher girls' schools (高等女學校) [schools primarily for Japanese], just as Japanese could enter common schools (普通學校), higher common schools (高等普通學校), and girls' higher common schools (女子高等普通學校) [schools primarily for Koreans]. For vocational education, specialized education, university education, and its preparatory education, co-education (共學) of Japanese and Koreans was made the principle. Vocational schools were to follow the Vocational School Ordinance and relevant regulations of the Ministry of Education (文部省令). Specialized education, university education, and its preparatory education were to follow the Specialized School Ordinance or the University Ordinance. Regarding universities, for the time being, only their preparatory courses (豫科) would be established, and the higher school (高等学校) system of mainland Japan would not be adopted for the time being. As for teacher training, whereas previously there were only normal courses attached to the boys' and girls' higher common schools in Kyŏngsŏng and P'yŏngyang, this time, one government normal school was specially established in Kyŏngsŏng and one public normal school in each province, <53> allowing teacher training to be conducted independently, albeit at an elementary level.

2. General Devotion to Education
However, this pertains to the educational system. The zeal and effort of the general Chosŏn populace towards education after Taishō 8 [1919] were truly astonishing. Not to mention the fervor for fundraising campaigns (財團期成運動) for various middle schools and specialized schools, and for establishing public schools in one's own region, it is common knowledge that the establishment of day/night lecture centers (晝夜學의 講習所) or improved Sŏdang (改良書堂), run centering around individual volunteers or local youth groups, has made a great contribution to the eradication of illiteracy (文盲退治) in Chosŏn.

3. One Student per 7 Households
Now, looking at this with numbers, as of the end of May last year [1924], there were 1,087 public common schools with over 361,000 students. There were 16 government higher common schools (since Kim'i [1919], one new school each was established in Chŏnju, Kyŏngsŏng [presumably another one], Sinŭiju, Kwangju, Tongnae, Kyŏngsŏng [North Hamgyong Province], Haeju, Kongju, Ch'ŏngju, Ch'unch'ŏn) with 5,740 students. There were 13 private higher common schools (since Kim'i, Chungang, Koch'ang, Ihwa, Chŏng'ŭi Higher Common Schools underwent reorganization) with over 5,900 students. For specialized schools, there were 6 government-established schools (since Kim'i, Kyŏngsŏng Imperial University Preparatory Course [京城帝國大學豫科] and Kyŏngsŏng Higher Commercial School [京城高等商業學敎] (mainly for Japanese) were newly added) with over 500 students, and 3 private schools with over 500 students. There were 60 government/public vocational schools with over 6,400 students, and 14 normal schools with over 1,500 students. Other private schools numbered 753 (of which 299 belonged to the management of foreign missionaries) with over 100,000 students. Calculating the total, as of the end of May last year, the total number of schools educating Koreans within Chosŏn was 1,952 (an increase of over 400 schools since Kim'i), with a total student population of approximately 480,000. Comparing this student number to the total number of Korean households at the end of last year, over 3,300,000, it calculates to approximately one student sent out per 7 households (before Kim'i, it was 1 student per 12 households).

1. The Problem of Japanese-Korean Co-education
A major issue for Koreans in the current education of Chosŏn, especially in specialized education, is the so-called Japanese-Korean co-education (日鮮人共學). That is, this "Japanese-Korean co-education" was something the Government-General authorities initiated back in April of Taishō 5 [1916] by almost borrowing a few specialized schools intended for Korean enrollment, in order to provide specialized education to the children of Japanese residents in Chosŏn. Since Taishō 8 [1919], <54> under the banner of abolishing discrimination between Japanese and Koreans, the principle of co-education for vocational specialized schools and university preparatory courses was established. From then on, the enrollment of Japanese students in various specialized schools increased dramatically. As of the end of May last year, looking at the breakdown of Japanese and Korean students in each specialized school: University Preparatory Course had 124 Japanese and 44 Koreans; Kyŏngsŏng Medical Specialized School (Kyŏngsŏng Ŭijŏn) had 199 Japanese and 198 Koreans; Kyŏngsŏng Higher Technical School (Kyŏngsŏng Kogon) had 83 Japanese and 44 Koreans; Kyŏngsŏng Higher Commercial School (Kyŏngsŏng Kosang) had 214 Japanese and 29 Koreans; Suwŏn Higher Agriculture and Forestry School had 143 Japanese and 63 Koreans. Only Kyŏngsŏng Law School (京城法學) had solely Korean students, numbering 179. Summing this up, there were 785 Japanese students and 532 Korean students, putting Japanese students in a position of occupying nearly two-thirds of the total student body. Especially in recent years, Japanese students coming over from mainland Japan are being admitted, and it seems the day is not far off (if things continue this way) when the few specialized schools currently existing in Chosŏn will become exclusively for Japanese use. This phenomenon was not so evident even under the Government-General's education policy before Taishō 8 – in other words, it is a product of the post-Saitō "benevolent administration" (善政). Is this the subtle flavor of "Impartial Benevolence" (一視同仁), "Abolition of Discrimination" (差別撤廢), and "Cultural Policy" (文化政策)?

2. The Fundamental Problem of the Educational World
There is much to say about Chosŏn education before and after Taishō 8 [1919]. However, due to space limitations, I will abbreviate and say one final word. In the last 5 or 6 years, the wealth (富力) of the Chosŏn populace has decreased daily. Although the desire for education is as high as Mount T'aesan, circumstances are such that more schools cannot be built, and children cannot be further educated. Furthermore, even after completing studies, the path to livelihood is uncertain (漠然). The presence or absence of educational fervor is no longer the issue; the immediate fate facing the majority of the populace is that they lack the strength to pursue education even if they want to. If this world continues as it is, the situation for common school students is still unknown, but from the middle school level upwards, the number of students seems likely to gradually decrease, and the day may not be far off when only the children of a few wealthy families pass through the school gates. When will the time come for education truly for the masses, making each and every person among the masses prosperous? <55>

**Summary**

This 1925 editorial traces the evolution of Korean education from the traditional Joseon system through the early modern reforms, the dramatic expansion before Japanese annexation, and the subsequent imposition of a colonial education system by the Government-General. It details the Japanese policy aimed at assimilation, suppressing private Korean initiatives while promoting Japanese language and loyalty. The article notes a surge in Korean demand for education after the 1919 March First Movement, leading to superficial reforms under the "Cultural Policy," but highlights the increasing dominance of Japanese students in higher/specialized education through the "co-education" policy. Finally, it laments the growing economic hardship preventing the Korean masses from accessing education, questioning the future viability of education for ordinary Koreans despite their strong desire for it.

For historians, this article is significant as a contemporary Korean critique of Japanese colonial education policy. It reveals the explicit assimilationist goals (creating "loyal subjects," promoting Japanese language, cultivating "subservience"), the methods used to control education (suppressing private schools, simplifying curricula for Koreans), the impact of the March First Movement on policy (concessions like extended school years but also strategic co-option like "co-education"), and the stark socio-economic realities limiting Korean access despite increased demand. The statistics provided on school/student numbers and the revealing breakdown of Japanese vs. Korean students in specialized schools offer concrete data on the effects of colonial policies. The final pessimistic outlook reflects the deep-seated concerns about cultural survival and social mobility under colonial rule.

喜悲交集의 敎育界의 昔今
1. 朝鮮新敎育의 淵源
우리가 다-아는 바와 가티 우리 朝鮮의 그 前 敎育制度는 京城에 成均舘과 東, 西, 南, 中의 四學을 두고 各 府郡에는 鄕校, 各 洞里에는 書堂을 두어 書堂으로브터 鄕校에 鄕校로브터 四學에 四學으로브터 다시 成均館에 드러가 最高學問을 배우게 하는 것으로써 大軆의 順序를 삼아왓섯다. 時運이 한 번 變하며 開國 502年 末에 科擧의 制가 廢止되고 翌年 乙未에는 當時政府(金宏集內閣)로브터 一般國政을 改革함과 가티 새로운 敎育制度를 베풀어 小學校, 中學校, 師範學校, 外國學校 其他學校를 세우니 이것이 朝鮮 새 敎育의 刱始이엿는 同時에 國民思想으로서의 一大 轉換을 보는 契機이엿다. 그러나 이 學校敎育은 當時의 人民이 만히 이를 理解치 못하고 朝暮로 更迭되는 政府 當局이 또한 이를 運用할 誠意를 缺하야 特別한 普及을 보지 못하다가 光武 8, 9年間의 日露戰役을 지내여 半島의 命運이 바야으로 岌嶪하게 된 時節에 밋처 疾風迅雷의 急速한 發展(卽 倂合直前의 隆熙 4年頃의 敎育界를 보면 普通學校, 高等學校, 外國語學校, 高等女學校 及 實業學校 等의 官公立學校는 除外하고라도 純民間便의 設立에 매인 私立學校만 2,000餘 校- 約 一面一校의 平均을 보앗는 바 當時 新敎育 風潮가 如何히 旺盛햇던 것을 이로써 可察)을 보앗스나 때는 벌서 느저서 모쳐럼 蔚興되든 新國民敎育도 왈카닥 너머지는 큰집의 最后를 救치 못하고 마럿다.

2. 敎育淵源의 改廢!
隆熙 4年에 日韓이 合邦되며 朝鮮總督府가 設置되쟈 卽時로 萬般制度를 뒤고치는 中 特히 敎育制度에 잇서는 일이 根本問題에 屬하는 바 輕忽히 制定할 일이 못된다하야＜51＞ 滿 1年間을 두고 두루 끙끙이를 대이다가 그 翌年 8月에 朝鮮敎育令을 發表하고 同 10月에 各 學校官制 及 諸規則을 發表하야 11月로써 實施하니 朝鮮敎育의 自在淵源은 이로써 中絶되고 大日本帝國에 對한 忠良國民을 養成키 爲한 和製敎育의 새 淵源이 그에 代하엿다.
當時 總督府 當局의 明言한 바에 依하면 『自令의 朝鮮人 敎育은 敎育勅語의 御趣旨에 基하야 忠良한 國民을 養成함을 本義로 하되 德性의 涵養과 日語의 普及에 致力하고 日常生活에 必須한 知識技能을 授하며 學校의 系統 及 程度를 簡約히 하기에 힘을 썻다』고 하엿다. 이를 다시 한 번 푸러 말하면 自今의 朝鮮人 敎育은 在來의 朝鮮 사람의 思想 感情을 變造하야 純然한 日本사람으로 同化케 하는 데에 本義를 두되 特히 從順性(總督府의 治下에 고이고이 從順할 그 性格-官制德性)의 涵養과 日本말의 學習에 全力케 하고 한便으로는 面, 府, 郡, 道, 裁判所의 書記, 産業技手, 普通學校 敎師, 醫員 其他 官公廳, 會社의 屬僚되기에 可할 知識技能을 주며 딸라 學校의 系統과 程度는 至極히 簡略케 하야 4年 卒業의 普通學校, 4年 卒業의 男子高普, 3年 卒業의 女子高普와 最高學府로의 몃 個專修學校를 누고 實業敎育機關으로는 簡易農業, 簡易工業, 簡易商業, 簡易水産을 設하야 簡易卑近 4字로만 爲主하되 몃 個의 獨立學校를 除한 外에는 모다 公立普通學校에 付設케 한다 함이다.
떠러진 밥알까지라도 自己가 주어먹고서야 決心의 우슴을 짓는 當局은 大正 4年 3月에 別로 私立學校規則이란 것을 制定하야 私立學校로서 普通敎育, 實業敎育 또는 專門敎育을 施코져하는 者는 當該學校(官公立의 各 學校)에 關한 規定에 準據하야 各其 敎科課程을 定하게 하고 또 其 敎員의 資格을 定한 結果 一自以後의 私立學校는 自進하야 其 組織을 變更하야 普通學校, 高等普通學校가 되거나 그러치 아느면 門을 닷거나 하는 두 가지 中 그 하나를 取치 아니치 못하게 되엿다. 이러하야 純然한 意味의 私立學校는 全滅되고 마는 셈이 되엿다.

3. 12戶에 學生1人
이러케 이러케 하야 몃 해를 지내온 大正 7年 (己未 前年) 녀름 現在의 朝鮮敎育界를 뒤져보면 全朝鮮을 通하야 普通學校가 462校에 生徒가 87,000餘 人 官立高等普通學校가 6(京城, 平壤, 大邱, 咸興에 各 1校가 잇는 外에 京城 平壤에 女子高普가 各1이엿다)에 生徒가 2,100餘人 同私立高等普校가 10校(京城의 養正, 培材, 普成, 徽文, 淑明, 進明, 開城의 好壽敦,＜52＞ 松都, 平壤의 光成, 東萊의 東萊高普 等)에 生徒가 2,000餘 人이엇스며 實業學校(仝年 10月 現在로 農業, 商業, 工業, 水産의 諸學校)가 88校에 生徒가 3,900餘 名이엿스며, 專門學校는 官立이 4校(京城專修, 京城醫專, 京城工專, 水原農林專門學校)에 生徒가 500餘 名, 私立이 3校(延禧, 세부란스, 普成專門學校)에 學生이 200餘 名이엿스며 以外의 私立學校는 同年 6月末 現在로 809校에 生徒 10萬人 以上을 算하엿다.
右를 總計하면 大正 7年 中의 朝鮮人 數育을 爲한 朝鮮內의 學校數는 1,382校에 約 20萬의 生徒가 잇섯스며 이를 同年 末이 朝鮮人 戶數 313萬 9千餘 戶(人口는 1,669萬 7千餘 人)에 對比하면 約 12戶에 學生 1人을 내서운 셈이 되엿다.

1. 敎育制度의 修正 大正 8年 3月이 지내엿다. 朝鮮 사람의 思想 感情에는 말할 수 업는 變動이 생기며 이 變動이 敎育方面으로 나타나서는 「爲先 알어야 한다」는 學問熱이 되야 書堂, 講習所로브터 小學校, 中學校, 專門學校 할 것 업시 모도가 배우겟다는 사람으로 툭 터지게 되매 自稱 文化政治를 標榜한 總督府 新當局者도 大勢의 所使에 엇지하는 수 업시 在來의 敎育方針을 多少間 改正하기로 되야 大正 9年 11月에는 爲先 普通學校 修業年限(從來의 4年)을 6箇年으로써 原則을 삼을 것과 高等普通學校에 2箇年 以內의 補習科를 둘 수 잇다는 것을 規定하고 다시 大正 11年 2月에는 朝鮮敎育令을 發布하야 學制全般에 亙한 改正을 行함과 가티 새로 總督府 諸學校官制, 公立學校校官制(日本人便) 普通學校, 高等普通學校, 女子高等普通學校의 各 規定을 制定하고 또 特別事情이 잇는 境遇에는 朝鮮人으로 小學校, 中學校, 高等女學校에 入學할 수 잇슴과 가티 日本人으로 普通學校, 高等普通學校, 女子高等普通學校에 入學할 수 잇게 하고 實業敎育 及 專門敎育 及 大學敎育 並其 豫備敎育에 잇서는 日鮮人의 共學을 原則으로 하고 實業學校는 實業學校令 及 文部省令의 當該規程에 準據하고 專門敎育, 大學敎育 並其 豫備敎育은 專門學校令 또는 大學令에 依하게 하되 大學에 對해서는 爲先 其 豫科를 두고 日本內地의 高等學校制度는 當分間 採用치 안키로 하엿스며 師範敎育에 對하야는 從來에는 京城 及 平壤의 男女高等普通學校에 師範科를 두엇슴에 不過하엿던 것을 今番에는 特別히 京城에 一個의 官立師範과 各 道에 一個의 公立師範學校를＜53＞ 두어 비록 初等程度의 것이나마 師範敎育을 獨立으로 行하게 하엿다.

2. 敎育에 對한 一般의 盡瘁 그러나 이것은 敎育制度에 關한 것을 말함이거니와 大正 8年 以後 우리 朝鮮人 一般의 敎育에 對한 熱誠가 努力은 實로 驚嘆할 일이엿다. 各 中學校, 專門學校의 財團期成運動과 自己地方의 公立學校期成에 얼마나 熱中하엿는가는 말도 말고 個人有志 또는 地方의 靑年團軆를 中心삼아 經營되는 晝夜學의 講習所 또는 改良書堂의 設立이 朝鮮의 文盲退治에 一大奇功이 되여 잇는 것은 누구나 아는 바이다.

3. 7戶에 學生 1人 이제 이를 數字로써 보면 昨年 5月 末 現在의 公立普通學校는 1,087校에 生徒가 361,000餘 人 官立高等普通學校가 16校(己未 以後로 全州, 京城 新義州, 光州, 東萊, 鏡城, 海州, 公州, 淸州, 春川에 各 1校가 新設)에 生徒가 5,740名, 私立高等普校가 13校(己未 以後로 中央, 高敞, 梨花, 正義高普가 새로 組織 變更)에 生徒가 5,900餘 名, 專門學校는 設立이 6校(己未 以後로 京城帝國大學豫科, 京城高等商業學敎(主로 日本人)가 新增)에 生徒가 500餘 名, 私立이 3校에 500餘 名, 官公立實業學校가 60校에 生徒가 6,400餘 名, 師範學校가 14校에 1,500餘 名, 以外의 私立學校가 753校(內에 外國 宣敎師의 管理에 屬한 것이 299校)에 生徒가 10萬餘 人-이를 統算하면 昨年 5月 末 現在의 朝鮮內에 朝鮮人을 敎育하는 學校는 總數 1,952校(己未 以後로 400餘 校가 增)에 全 生徒가 約 48萬餘 名인 바 이 生徒數를 昨年 末 朝鮮人 全戶數의 330萬餘 戶에 對比하면 約 7戶에 生徒 1人을 내여 세운 셈(己未 以前은 12戶에 1人)이 되엿다.

1. 問題의 日鮮人共學
朝鮮 現在의 敎育 中 特히 專門敎育에 잇서 朝鮮人에게 一大 問題가 되는 것은 所謂 日鮮人共學이라는 그것이다. 卽 日鮮共學이란 것은 朝鮮內에 居住하는 日本人子弟에게 專門敎育을 주기 爲하야 일즉히 大正 5年 4月에 總督府 當局으로브터 朝鮮人 就學의 몃 個 專門學校를 借用하다십히 하든 것인대 이것이 大正 8年 以後로＜54＞ 所謂 日鮮人間 差別을 撤廢한다 하며 實業專門學校 及 大學豫科에 對한 共學의 原則을 規定해 놋차브터는 各 專門學校에 日本人 入學生이 激增하야 昨年 5月末 現在 各 專門校의 日鮮人學生別을 보면 大學豫科에 日本人이 124名 朝鮮人이 44名. 京城醫專에 日本人이 199名 朝鮮人이 198名, 京城高工에 日本人이 83名, 朝鮮人이 44名, 京城高商에 日本人이 214名 朝鮮人이 29名, 水原高等農林에 日本人이 143名, 朝鮮人이 63名이오, 但 京城法學에만 朝鮮人 學生 179名이 잇슬 뿐으로써 이를 總計하면 日本人이 785名, 朝鮮人이 532名인 바 日本人學生이 總 學生數의 근 3分之 2를 占하는 形勢이며 特히 近年에 와서는 日本 內地로부터 건너오는 日人 學生을 밧는 바 朝鮮 안에 現存한 몃 個의 專門學校가 日本人 專用이 될 날도 몃 해가 못가리운 듯 십다(이대로만 간다하면). 이런 現像은 大正 8年 以前의 總督府 敎育方針에서도 그러케 볼 수 업던-달리 말하면 齋藤善政 以後의 産物이라. 一視同仁, 差別撤廢, 文化政策의 妙味가 大槪 이러한 데에 잇는 것인가.

2. 敎育界의 根本問題
大正 8年 前後의 朝鮮敎育에 對하야 말을 하자면 할 것이 만타. 그러나 紙面 關係로 이만 略하고 最後로 一言할 것은 最近 5,6年 以來로 朝鮮民衆의 富力이 日減하야 敎育에 對한 마음은 泰山 가트나 學校를 더 세울 수도 업고 子弟를 더 공부식일 수도 업는 形便이며 또 工夫를 하고 난 後일지라도 生活의 길이 漠然한 바 敎育熱의 有無는 어느듯 問題가 아니오 敎育을 할내도 할 힘이 업게 되는 것이 多數 民衆의 當面의 運命이 된 그것이다. 이 世上이 이대로만 간다하면 普通學校生은 아즉 모르지만 中學 程度의 學校부터도 學生數는 漸減되고 몃 名의 有産家 子息들만 校門을 드나들 날도 멀지 아늘 듯 십다. 진실로 民衆을 爲한 敎育이 民衆의 사람 사람을 福되게 할 때는 어느 때이고.＜55＞
