The fiscal relationship between Chosŏn and Japan began in October of Meiji 37 (1904) with the installation of a Japanese financial advisor in the Korean government.

As a result of the Japan-Korea annexation in Meiji 40 (1907) - from the Japanese government, aside from lending 19,682,623 *wŏn* interest-free and indefinitely over the 6 years until Meiji 45 (1912) for various facility funds for the administration of Chosŏn, it granted 12,350,000 *wŏn* as subsidies for emergency facilities from Meiji 44 (1911) onwards. Starting from Taishō 2 (1913), it was decided to reduce this supplementary funding by 2,350,000 *wŏn*. Then, for the 5 years from Taishō 3 (1914) onwards, although the independence of Chosŏn's finances was planned as much as possible, it did not come to fruition. Subsidies were received: 10,000,000 *wŏn* in Taishō 9 (1920), 15,000,000 *wŏn* in Taishō 10 (1921), over 15,900,000 *wŏn* in Taishō 11 (1922), over 15,120,000 *wŏn* in Taishō 12 (1923), and over 15,120,000 *wŏn* in Taishō 13 (1924), meaning the same subsidy as in year 12 was received.

Comparison Table of Government-General Revenue and Expenditure for Taishō 7 (1918) and Taishō 13 (1924)

In the 7 years from year 7 (1918) to year 13 (1924), the increase in revenue and expenditure was over 76,320,000 *wŏn*. Now, looking at the detailed items of revenue and expenditure:

Recent Population of Chosŏn by Category

According to the survey at the end of Taishō 12 (1923), the total number of households was 3,404,181, of which 3,282,792 were Korean households, 110,439 were Japanese households, and 10,950 were foreigner households. The total population was 17,884,163, of which 17,446,913 were Koreans, 403,011 were Japanese, and 35,039 were foreigners. Now, comparing this with the end of Meiji 43 (1910) and the end of Taishō 6 (1917) to see the increase or decrease:

**Summary**

This article from 1925 outlines the financial relationship between colonial Korea (Chosŏn) and Japan starting from 1904, detailing loans and subsidies provided by Japan to the Government-General of Chosŏn, especially after the 1907 annexation. It highlights a significant increase (over 76 million *wŏn*) in the Government-General's budget between 1918 (Taishō 7) and 1924 (Taishō 13). The article also provides population statistics for late 1923, breaking down households and individuals by Korean, Japanese, and foreign categories, and mentions plans to compare these figures with 1910 and 1917 data. Additionally, it points towards further sections detailing provincial areas/populations, urban population changes, and a comparison of security/policing levels before and after the 1919 March First Movement (Kimi Year). For historians, the article offers valuable contemporary data on the colonial administration's finances, revealing increasing Japanese financial control and expenditure in Korea. The demographic breakdown showing the growing Japanese population and the specific mention of comparing security costs around the time of the March First Movement are particularly revealing about the tightening colonial grip and response to Korean resistance.
