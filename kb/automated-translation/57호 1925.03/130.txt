Errata

In the list of esteemed contributors (芳名錄) in the literary section (文藝欄) of this magazine's (本誌) February issue, Mr. Chu Yohan's (朱耀翰氏) age, 28, was a misprint (誤植) for 26, and Mr. Chu Yosŏp's (朱耀爕氏) age, 26, was a misprint for 24. Also, we mention that Mr. Ubo Min (**氏) was omitted (漏落) from the same list of esteemed contributors. <62>

**Summary**

This brief editorial notice corrects errors published in the previous month's (February 1925) issue of the magazine *Kaebyŏk*. Specifically, it rectifies the incorrectly printed ages of contributors Chu Yohan and Chu Yosŏp and notes the accidental omission of another contributor, identified as "Ubo Min **ssi**," from the contributors' list. For historians, this small correction provides precise biographical data (ages) for prominent literary figures Chu Yohan and Chu Yosŏp as of early 1925. It also sheds light on the editorial practices of *Kaebyŏk* and mentions another contemporary figure, "Ubo Min **ssi**," potentially aiding in identifying contributors from that era.
