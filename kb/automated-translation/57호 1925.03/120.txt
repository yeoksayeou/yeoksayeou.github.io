Land in Korea Held by the Oriental Development Company and Other Japanese

If there is something that tears off flesh and grinds bones, where could it be more so than the Oriental Development Company (Tōtaku)? As just one example, are not the people of Sain-myŏn in Pongsan-gun and the people of Pukryul-myŏn in Chaeryŏng-gun caught in its poisonous fangs and now facing death? Ah, Tōtaku, the evil demon for Koreans, how can you be so cruel? How much of Korea's land have you taken? How many Korean lives have you stolen?

Regarding Korea, the cultivated land area is approximately 1,550,000 chŏngbo of paddy fields (畓), approximately 2,840,000 chŏngbo of dry fields (田), and approximately 140,000 chŏngbo of fire fields (火田), totaling 4,530,000 chŏngbo. Currently, the land held by Tōtaku (as of the end of 1923) is 51,297 chŏngbo of paddy fields, 21,357 chŏngbo of dry fields, 3,324 chŏngbo of miscellaneous land (雜種地), and 12,344 chŏngbo of forest land (山林), totaling 88,334 chŏngbo. In terms of value, it is 17,929,243 Won. (In the first year of Taishō [1912], it was 48,037 chŏngbo), and at the end of the 6th year of Taishō [1917], it was 74,738 chŏngbo, which increased to over 88,000 chŏngbo by the 12th year [1923]. Thus, year after year, it keeps eating away more and more. In another 10 years, it will double to 167,000 chŏngbo, and in 100 years, over 1,000,000 chŏngbo will fall into the clutches of that poisonous demon. The entire landmass of all Korea will end up in its venomous hands. Although it is utterly impossible that there will be no changes before that happens...

While recent investigations into Tōtaku's holdings in each province are incomplete, looking at the data from the 8th year of Taishō [1919], North and South Chŏlla Province and Hwanghae Province suffered the most severe harm.

The Tōtaku-occupied land in each province of Korea up to the 8th year of Taishō is as described above. Now, let's look at the distribution of its immigrants. By the end of March, Taishō 13 [1924], 3,939 households and 18,514 people had immigrated to Korea. <60>

Tōtaku has taken this much land in Korea, and this many Tōtaku immigrants have come to Korea. Consequently, Koreans must have been dispossessed of that much land and driven out by that much. Besides this, if we consider the land held by Japanese societies or individuals, we cannot help but be even more astonished. According to a survey at the end of Taishō 11 [1922], the area owned by Japanese was 137,000 chŏngbo of paddy fields, 77,000 chŏngbo of dry fields, and over 40,000 chŏngbo of other land, totaling over 255,000 chŏngbo.

Is this all? State-owned land (國有地), military land (軍用地), railway land (鐵道用地), various mining lands (各鑛産地), land held by the Chōsen Shokusan Ginkō (殖銀占有地) - truly, it can be said that almost all crucial land in Korea has fallen into Japanese hands.

**Summary**

This 1925 article vehemently denounces the Oriental Development Company (Tōtaku) as a "poisonous demon" responsible for extensive land expropriation in colonial Korea. It provides statistics showing Tōtaku's increasing land holdings between 1912 and 1923, totaling over 88,000 chŏngbo, and expresses alarm at the projected future expansion. The article also quantifies Japanese immigration facilitated by Tōtaku (nearly 4,000 households by 1924) and notes additional vast tracts of land held by other Japanese entities and individuals, concluding that essential Korean lands are falling under Japanese control. For historians, this piece is valuable as it offers contemporary data on land ownership shifts, highlights the central, resented role of Tōtaku, quantifies Japanese settlement, and vividly expresses Korean anxieties and outrage regarding colonial economic policies and dispossession.

東拓 其他 日本人이 가진 朝鮮의 土地
살을 뜨더먹고 뼈를 갈가먹는 그 무엇이 잇다하면 東拓 以上이 어대 또 잇스랴. 爲先 一例로는 鳳山郡의 舍人面民, 載寧郡의 北栗面民이 그의 毒牙에 걸녀 方今 죽게되지 안엇는가? 아-朝鮮人의 惡鬼인 東拓아 엇지면 이다지도 酷毒하냐? 朝鮮의 土地는 얼마나 가젓느냐. 朝鮮人의 生命은 얼마나 빼아삿느냐?
朝鮮에 對한 耕地面積은 畓이 約 155萬町步 田이 約 284萬町步 火田이 約 14萬町步 合計 453萬町步인데 現下 東拓이 가진 土地는(12年 末) 畓이 51,297町步 田이 21,357町步 雜種地가 3,324町步 山林이 12,344町步 合計 88,334町步를 가젓다. 價格으로는 17,929,243圓이다. (大正 元年度는 48,037町步)엿고 大正 6年 末은 74,738町步엿든 것이 12年度에 와서는 88,000餘町步가 되얏다. 이러케 年年歲歲 작구작구 먹어 드러간다. 압흐로 10年이면 곱질어 16,7萬町步 100年되는 날은 100餘 萬町步가 저 毒鬼의 손아긔에 들 것이다. 全鮮의 全땅덩어리가 저의 毒手에 들고 말 것이다. 그러케 되기까지 아무 變動이 업슬 理도 萬無하지만은...
이제 最近의 各道에 對한 東拓 所有別은 調査가 未詳하나 大正 8年度로써 본다하면 全羅南北道 黃海道가 가장 그의 酷害를 被하얏다.
大正 8年 末 現在 所在別 及 地目別 面積＜59＞

大正 8年까지의 朝鮮 各道의 東拓所占土地는 以上과 갓다. 이제 또 그 移民의 分配를 한 번 본다하면 大正 13年 末까지 3,939戶 18,514人이 朝鮮에 移來하얏다.＜60＞

移住民 道別 及 回期別 戶數表 (大正 13年 3月 末日 現在)

移民戶數 及 人口表 (1924年 3月 末日 現在)

東拓은 이만큼 朝鮮의 土地를 가젓고 東拓移民은 이만큼 朝鮮에 왓다. 代로 朝鮮人은 그만콤 뺏기고 또 그만콤 쫏겨낫슬 것이다. 이 밧게 日本人이 社會 又는 個人으로 가진 土地를 一幣하면 더구나 놀내지 안을 수 업다. 大正 11年 末 調査에 依하면 日本人의 所有面積이 畓이 13萬 7千町步 田이 7萬 7千町步 其他가 4萬餘 町步 合計 25萬 5千餘 町步라 한다.
이것 뿐이냐. 國有地 軍用地 鐵道用地 各鑛産地 殖銀占有地-實로 朝鮮의 肝要地全部가 日本人의 手中에 들엇다해도 可하다.
