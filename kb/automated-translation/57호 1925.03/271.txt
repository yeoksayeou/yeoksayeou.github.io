餘言 (Postscript)
◇There is no month as difficult to edit as March. It is quite difficult to handle national issues, social issues, and even the literature and arts section somehow (엿전지). These must be dealt with, but for some reason (엿전지), hesitation keeps arising. We know that readers will undoubtedly understand.

◇Regardless, we blindly edited this as the "Comparing Aspects of Chosŏn Issue." It is regrettable that due to conflicts here and there, the content could not be made thorough and meticulous, but we are confident that the general aspect of Chosŏn has been captured reasonably well. Nasan-gun's "The Past and Present of Chosŏn Politics" and Tonggwan-saeng's "Q&A on the Transition of Chosŏn Thought" are not an exaggeration to call an overview of the phenomena in Chosŏn.

◇Because this issue is the "Comparing Aspects of Chosŏn Issue," due to page count constraints, we unavoidably had to postpone the previously promised Ch'ungbuk Field Survey Report (忠北踏査記) to the April issue. If we are blamed for the editorial office's breach of promise (背信), we have no reply. We especially apologize (謝過) to the people of Ch'ungbuk. We can only ask for your kind understanding (高諒) and that you wait for the April issue (四月號).

◇As it is sunny spring March (陽春三月), everything stirs with new sentiment (情趣), so we particularly focused our main effort (主力) on the literature and arts section. However, it is regrettable above all that we also could not publish the previously promised reader's literature and arts (讀者文藝). When we guess (짐작) there will be stern reprimands (嚴責) saying, "Do you treat reader's literature and arts so negligently (等閑)?", we further have no reply.

◇We feel truly sorry (未安) for stating too much about what couldn't be published. However, due to responsibility (責任上), we must add unavoidable words. It is the statement that we cannot publish the previously announced (預告) March Diary Entry (三月中日記文). More than page count constraints, we cannot publish it because we fear trouble (말성) from the authorities (當局). Although this was certainly anticipated, we ultimately do not have the freedom (自由) to publish it. We ask for the general (一般) public's understanding (諒解).

◇This time, we are set to conduct a field survey (踏査) of Hwanghae Province (黃海道). Ch'a and Pak are scheduled to depart at the end of February (二月末). We request in advance much support (後援) from the people of Hwanghae Province.

**Summary**

This editor's postscript from the March 1925 issue of *Kaebyŏk* magazine outlines the difficulties faced during editing. The editors apologize for delaying several promised articles, including a Ch'ungbuk field survey report and reader submissions, primarily due to space limitations in the special "Comparing Aspects of Chosŏn" issue. More significantly, they explicitly state their inability to publish a planned "March Diary Entry" due to fear of "trouble from the authorities," highlighting the lack of press freedom. The postscript reveals the challenges of discussing sensitive "national" and "social" issues under colonial rule and the constant negotiation between content, space, and censorship faced by Korean publications in the 1920s. Historians would find the direct admission of self-censorship due to fear of "the authorities" particularly revealing about the constraints on expression during the Japanese colonial period.
