**Summary**

This article outlines the regulations for the "Agency Department" established by the Kaebyŏk-sa (開闢社) publishing house in 1921. The service aimed to help readers, particularly those in rural areas and followers of Ch'ŏndogyo, purchase a wide variety of goods reliably and potentially at lower prices through the magazine's mediation and special contracts with suppliers. It details ordering procedures, payment terms (partial advance payment with cash on delivery), handling of fees, restrictions, and return policies, emphasizing trust and convenience. For historians, this piece reveals the early commercial diversification of a prominent nationalist and religious (Ch'ŏndogyo-affiliated) publication during the colonial period. It showcases an effort to build a network beyond publishing, connecting urban suppliers with rural consumers and religious adherents, and provides a snapshot of consumer goods (from traditional items like brassware and Korean shoes to modern imports like Western clothing and cosmetics) desired in Korea at the time.
