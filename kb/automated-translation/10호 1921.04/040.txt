乙. Mo School (墨家)
Mo Tzu (墨子)
Since Meng Tzu (孟子) repudiated Mo Tzu (墨子), scholars have blindly followed this convention, and few have revered Mo Tzu. However, anyone who reads Mo Tzu's book cannot fail to assert that the spirit of patriotism permeates the entire volume. His words state, "In all human nations, one must choose duties and engage in affairs. When the state is dark and chaotic, speak of 'Promoting the Worthy' and 'Promoting Unity.' When the state is [prosperous? *], speak of 'Moderating Expenditures' and 'Moderating Funerals.' When the state delights in music [and extravagance? **], speak of 'Condemning Music' and 'Condemning Fatalism.' When the state is licentious, perverse, and without propriety, speak of 'Honoring Heaven' and 'Serving Ghosts.' When the state strives to seize and invade, speak of 'Universal Love'." Thus, his writings are significant. They were observed from a social perspective. And the main points are namely Heaven's benefit, ghosts' benefit, and human benefit; in his itinerant preaching, there was nothing to which these did not apply.

Mo Tzu's dates are subject to various theories, but from our perspective, using Meng Tzu's words as a standard: Meng Tzu said, "Sage kings do not arise, the feudal lords are unrestrained, itinerant scholars argue willfully, the words of Yang Chu (楊朱) and Mo Ti (墨翟) [fill? *] the world. The words of the world belong either to Yang or to Mo." Viewing it from this, during Meng Tzu's time, the followers of Yang [and Mo? *] filled the world, vigorously promoting their doctrines. If so, Mo Tzu must have been a person from at least one generation before Meng Tzu. Furthermore, collecting other evidence, it seems plausible he lived around 47 years after Confucius's death.

Doctrine: Love - Benefit - Anti-Fatalism (愛-利-非命說)
1. Love (愛): Generally, the emergence of competition and conflict in society are all accompanied by our concept of hatred arising from conflict. Therefore, if this concept is fundamentally removed from within our spirit, then high officials will not offend the ruler, sons will not disobey fathers, and consequently, the fear of rival states checking each other will disappear, and the happiness of peace under Heaven can always be obtained. However, if we now contrast love and hate and try to reject one, it is ultimately impossible. Why? Because these two mutually presuppose each other, taking only one naturally cannot avoid becoming a contradiction.
Consider this: Is it not that under the single concept of love, one kills people and seizes wealth to benefit oneself? Therefore, if one tries to preserve the idea of loving oneself as before, while only removing the idea of hating others, it is ultimately an impossible task. To remove the idea of hating others, there is nothing better than first standing upon the two concepts of love and hate, which are relative to each other. <22> To speak plainly, loving both others and oneself simultaneously is called 'Universal Love' (兼愛). Ultimately, absolute love has the power to bring peace to the world. It is said, "When the world practices universal mutual love, there is order; when they mutually hate, there is chaos." And again, "Love has no gradations of thickness or thinness." Thinking about this, Mo Tzu must have also precisely distinguished between non-discriminating love and discriminating love, considering that love has no distinction of size, distance, or proximity. What is called loving people means loving universally; it decidedly does not mean loving this person and that person [selectively]. Thus, loving people means loving all people – that is, universal love could be called 'all-encompassing love' (周愛). If love is thus conceived as a unifying concept, called non-discriminating, equal love, then will society truly become non-discriminating, or what would become of the ethical rules of the ancestors? If that is the case, then besides love, there must be a principle of discrimination. If this is called 'respect' (恭), and if it provides a foundation upon which all societal rules can be established, how should these be explained? Discussing this next:

Ethical Rules (倫理的 法則): On the plane of non-discrimination, there is love, and as a condition arising from discrimination, there is respect (恭). Therefore, all ethical rules must be deduced from the concept of love. If a person views another person's body as their own, and views another person's suffering as their own sorrow, who would conceive thoughts of harming or injuring others? However, there are two main points of logic: (1) To extinguish the thought of harming others. (2) To uphold the duty of rescuing others in urgent need. If these rules truly exist, then chaos and strife will surely never occur in the world.
Generally, attacking another's state or executing another's ruler is not because one harms that state or hates that ruler, but solely to eliminate harm to the world. In other words, those who inflict harm upon the world have already violated the concept of non-discrimination, which is the foundation of society, and therefore cannot exist within society. Thus, punishing such actors is not hating people, but simply seeking to remove the harm. Later scholars, disregarding the fact that Mo Tzu's thought had reached this highest level, considered only discriminating love as superior and absolutely rejected Mo Tzu as a proponent of social egalitarianism. Meng Tzu was one such person. Therefore, pointing to Mo Tzu, he said, "[To advocate universal love] is to be without father and without ruler; this is to be an animal." We cannot but offer a word of defense for Mo Tzu. Mo Tzu said, "Now, the gentlemen of the world who sincerely desire the wealth of the world and detest its poverty, who desire the order of the world and detest its chaos, should practice universal mutual love and mutual benefit. This is the law of the sage kings, the way to govern the world. One cannot but strive to practice it." This states that universal love was already embodied by the former kings. Mo Tzu also said, "As for the filial son planning for his parents, I do not know, does the filial son planning for his parents perhaps desire that others love his parents? Or does he perhaps desire that others hate and harm his parents?" This means that one who loves their parents cannot but also love the parents of others. <23> Thus, Mo Tzu took a step further, recognizing love as regulating mutual relationships, while also discerning the urgent needs of the time. Ultimately, the reason Mo Tzu is Mo Tzu truly lies here: If I love my family, then I will not harm my family. If I love others' families, then I will not harm others' families. This is Mo Tzu's fundamental concept; so-called 'universal love' is non-discriminating equality. In a word, anyone who reads Mo Tzu's book, no matter how careless a reader, will acknowledge that regarding ethical rules, there is not the slightest difference from Confucianism.

2. Benefit (曰 利): Besides love, Mo Tzu laid down another major principle, called 'Benefit' (利). Benefit is the foundation upon which society is maintained. Mo Tzu often mentioned love and benefit together, saying "love them and benefit them" (愛之利之). What he called benefit is nothing other than material strength. Because there is material strength, society is thereby maintained. Therefore, one cannot but be careful about the method of increasing this strength. If one errs in this, it will only lead to increasing destruction; if one is careful, it will lead to increasing growth. The proliferation of the population and the richness of life depend entirely on this. Thus, Benefit means "benefiting Heaven above, benefiting ghosts in the middle, and benefiting people below." Promoting this is what advances human pleasure and aids the progress of civilization.

Deductions from the Concept of Benefit (利の觀念 演繹): Benefit is called the concrete core of society and the area encouraged by the sages. From this, various consequences follow.
(1) Moderation in Funerals (節葬): Mo Tzu said, "The ancient sage kings' method of moderating funerals was: three layers of clothing are sufficient for the flesh to decay, a coffin three inches thick is sufficient for the bones to decay, dig a pit deep enough not to reach the groundwater, [where] vapors do not escape, then stop." This is truly the fundamental thought behind Mo Tzu's advocacy of frugal funerals. This arose from his witnessing the excessive extravagance in funeral rites of his time, from lords and kings down to the common people, due to the complex rituals and empty displays of Confucianism, leading to decline and ruin. He felt indignation and sorrow, leading him to utter these words. Besides this, there are other reasons for advocating frugal funerals, but they are omitted here. Also, in Mo Tzu's chapter on self-cultivation, it says, "Although mourning has its form, grief is its basis." Synthesizing these points, Mo Tzu's thought aligns with Confucius's saying, "In ritual, it is better to be frugal than extravagant; in mourning, it is better to be genuinely sorrowful than merely formal." Ultimately, Mo Tzu's advocacy should be called 'moderation in funerals' (節葬); calling it 'frugal funerals' (薄葬) is quite inappropriate.
(2) Moderation in Expenditures (節用): Mo Tzu did not only advocate节约 in funerals but sought to节约 in anything that was beneficial to society. He said, "When the people of ancient times were first born, they lived in hills and mounds. The sage kings worried for them, had them dig caves to live in, then advanced a step further, having them build palaces and houses to avoid wind and rain, and making things clean to perform sacrifices. This was for the convenience of the people by the former kings. Therefore, the sage kings did nothing that was not beneficial." He also said, "Removing useless ways and supplementing the people's benefit is the great benefit for the world." Viewing it from this, he sought to discard anything useless for economic production. <24>
(3) Condemning Music (非樂): The former kings used music with the purpose of cultivating people's minds and bringing the world under unified governance. However, later kings were not so; they neglected their duties and indulged entirely in music, song, dance, bells, and drums. This was what Mo Tzu vehemently denounced. Not only regarding rulers, but also men who indulged in music neglected their farming duties and forgot their palace service obligations, and women who indulged in music abandoned their responsibilities and rejected sericulture and tea-making. Ultimately, sounds like those of Zheng and Wei corrupted customs and decayed people's minds. These are all the evils of music. This was the point Mo Tzu most vehemently denounced.

In essence, love and benefit are Heaven's original intention. What Heaven desires is solely love and benefit; what it detests is everything contrary to this. How do we know this is so? We know it because Heaven universally loves people and simultaneously benefits them. Therefore, those who love and benefit people will surely be blessed, and those who hate and harm people will surely be visited by misfortune. Viewed this way, the proof of Heaven's existence in Mo Tzu is as follows:
(1) The fact that society as a whole receives love and benefit.
(2) The fact that rewards and punishments are justly applied. Thus, Mo Tzu proved Heaven and aligned it with the original meaning of the Confucian and Daoist ways in China. Mo Tzu's Heaven is frequently just. Just as Confucius said, "Only Heaven is great, only Yao modelled himself upon it," Mo Tzu also established a chapter called "Models and Standards" (法儀) discussing the laws one should model oneself after Heaven, saying: Those who engage in the affairs of the world cannot be without models and standards. Then, where should one find what model? Only Heaven exists. Heaven's virtue as Heaven has three aspects:
(1) Its operation (行) is vast and without partiality.
(2) Its bestowal (施) is generous and its virtue is great.
(3) Its brilliance (明) is enduring and does not decay. Such universal, constant, and bright action is not something we humans are capable of. Therefore, the sage kings modeled themselves upon it, he says.

3. Anti-Fatalism (曰 非命說): Our actions are where Heaven's intention lies, and where Heaven's intention lies is where righteousness (義) lies. It is imperative that even the smallest daily matter is undertaken in accordance with Heaven's intention. Some people in the world claim Mo Tzu advocated utilitarianism (効利說), but this is not actually the case. The reason Mo Tzu rejected fatalism (有命) was that he established the two principles of the universe as love and benefit, and from these deduced ethical rules and social customs. That is, both rules and customs are necessary along with the necessity of the principles, and permanent along with their permanence; by this, actions were set to a fixed standard. Therefore, the theory of Heavenly Mandate (天命說) is unacceptable. Only those who follow Heaven's intention will Heaven surely reward, and those who do not follow it, Heaven will surely punish. However, Mo Tzu's anti-fatalism seems primarily directed at its political implications. Generally, the words of those who adhere to fatalism say, "If fate decrees wealth, one becomes wealthy; if fate decrees poverty, one becomes poor; if fate decrees a large population, <25> the population becomes large; if fate decrees a small population, the population becomes small; if fate decrees order or chaos, there is order or chaos; if fate decrees longevity or [premature death? 天], one lives long or dies prematurely." If such talk becomes prevalent among the people, the hundred surnames will not strive in their occupations, the officials will not attend to their duties, but sit idly with folded hands, all saying, "It is fate! What can I do?" And the final result will be that the world becomes impoverished and barren, the state collapses, eventually reaching a state beyond salvation. This is why the theory of fatalism is harmful. Ultimately, Mo Tzu's strong advocacy of anti-fatalism was solely intended to make people act according to ethical rules and social customs.

Conclusion
Mo Tzu's statements, such as "mourning rituals are based on grief" or "promoting the worthy and befriending scholars is the key to governing a state," show absolutely no difference from Confucius. If so, one might say Mo Tzu was a follower of Confucius. The Huainanzi (淮南子) says, "Mo Tzu studied the Confucian ways, received the techniques of Confucius, but considered the rituals troublesome and was displeased." Even looking at it this way, Mo Tzu's doctrines are similar to Confucius', leaving no room for doubt. Unfortunately, Meng Tzu fiercely repudiated him; how can one not feel grief for Mo Tzu? Generally, Meng Tzu was a statesman of his time. Consequently, he rushed east and west trying to manage and control society. In contrast, the followers of Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu were different; they were philosophers and hidden gentlemen who avoided the world and were content with cultivating themselves. In what sense could their meaning align with Meng Tzu and others?

丙. Daoist School (道家) (Taoism (仙敎) was renamed during the Jin (晋) Dynasty)
Lao Tzu (老子) (Legend and Book)
Lao Tzu's surname was Li (李), his given name was Er (耳), and his courtesy name was Poyang (伯陽). Because his ears were long without rims (漫), he was commonly called [Tan? *] (聃). According to the Records of the Grand Historian (史記), he was a native of K'u County (苦縣) in Ch'u (楚), which is now Kuyang County (谷陽縣) in Haochou (毫州). Thus, there is no doubt Lao Tzu was from north of the Yangtze River (江北). While serving as an official in charge of the archives (守*室吏) of Chou (周) and overseeing the state books, Confucius came to inquire about ritual (禮). Then, witnessing the disintegration of the Chou house along with the scattering of the people like crumbling earth, he became melancholic and displeased, abandoned his post, and entered the Western Dispersal Pass (西散關). When the pass keeper Yin Hsi (*人尹喜) asked him about the Way (道), he finally wrote down the Daodejing (道德經) of five thousand-odd words and departed.

Doctrine (學說)
Confucius sought to order society based on predetermined rituals (禮), whereas Lao Tzu sought to govern the world by letting human nature follow its natural course (自然). In this respect, a great gap arises between the two masters, K'ung (孔) and Lao (老). Confucius's thought originates in socio-ethical thought, while Lao Tzu's thought originates in non-social naturalistic thought. However, there is no doubt that both Lao Tzu and Confucius traced the origins of their thought to the time of Yao (堯) and Shun (舜), gradually descending until reaching full development in these two masters.
Regarding the origins of Lao Tzu's learning, various theories exist. (1) It is based on the Book of Changes (周易). This is the view of Yen Tsun (嚴遵) of the Former Han, Wang Chi (王績) of the Sui, Shao K'ang-chieh (邵康節) of the Sung, [*Shuo chih?]'s Ogyū Sorai (物徂徠) and his followers. The basis for this is <26> the similarity between Lao Tzu's thought and the thought of the Changes. (2) It is based on Jung Ch'eng (容成). However, it is unknown who Jung Ch'eng was. Sources like the Lüshi Chunqiu (呂賢列子) and Han Shi Waizhuan (韓詩外傳) each offer different accounts. (3) It originated from the official historians (史官). This is found in the "Treatise on Literature" (藝文志) of the Book of Han (漢書), which states: "[The Daoist school] considered the records of success and failure, survival and extinction, fortune and misfortune, the ways of past and present, and then knew how to grasp the essential, hold to the fundamental, maintain oneself through purity and emptiness, and sustain oneself through humility and weakness." It is unknown which official historian discussed this theory. If we consider that the practitioners of "Pure Conversation" (淸談) prevalent during the Wei-Jin (魏晉) period were all implementers of theories of emptiness and nothingness, this explanation must not be wrong.

Pure Philosophy (純正 哲學): In contrast to Confucius, who regarded the Way (道) as the rituals established by the former kings, Lao Tzu regarded the Way as something indefinable and indescribable. Any Way that can be pointed to as fixed, or any Name that can be known through fixed designation, is decidedly not the constant Way or the constant Name. The constant Way and constant Name are indestructible through myriad ages. That which can be described by name is decidedly not something that can endure through myriad ages. For example, if one calls something beautiful, even if everyone in the world calls it beautiful, that beauty is relative to non-beauty, and therefore decidedly not true beauty. Similarly, calling something good is also like this; even if everyone in the world calls it good, because this goodness is relative to evil, it is clearly not true goodness. This thought of Lao Tzu – that designated and named things are formed in anticipation of their opposites – is the fundamental idea behind his theories of worldly conduct and military strategy. Therefore, Lao Tzu's Way is an Absolute that transcends the realm of relativity, something utterly indescribable. Although the Way is thus indescribable, it is not non-existent. Therefore, describing it, he says: "The Way as a thing is Opaque! Obscure! Oh, obscure, opaque, within it there is substance. Oh, deep, dark, within it there is essence. This essence is very real; within it there is truth." Examining the meaning here, it is nothing other than that the Way contains all myriad things, but is nevertheless undefined.
Lao Tzu depicted the Way as static (靜的), empty (虛的), or non-existent (無的). Why? Because the Way is an eternally unchanging substance capable of producing all transformations, yet ultimately its traces cannot be seen. Also, Lao Tzu stated that the substance of all things is empty, still, and non-existent. Therefore, when myriad things are left to their own nature (自然), they will naturally return to emptiness, stillness, and non-existence. He said: "Attain utmost emptiness, hold firmly to stillness. Myriad things arise together; I thereby watch their return. Things flourish, flourish, [each? *] returning to its root. Returning to the root is called stillness. Stillness is called returning to fate (復命). Returning to fate is called constancy (常). Knowing constancy is called enlightenment (明)." This, then, is the fundamental thought of Lao Tzu's political and ethical theories.

Practical Philosophy (實踐 哲學)
Ethics and Politics (倫理論倂政治論): The time of primordial purity (太古 純*) was when the Way was perfectly realized in society without defect. The people had no knowledge whatsoever but obtained their lives and finished their lives, that was all. Then, so-called sages emerged <27> and created categories such as benevolence (仁), righteousness (義), loyalty (忠), trustworthiness (信), filial piety (孝), kindness (慈), ritual (禮), and music (樂). From this, the people began to know what direction to follow, and consequently started distinguishing between right and wrong, good and evil. Thereupon, unfilial piety, disloyalty, unkindness, and impropriety appeared, and the world fell into chaos because of this. Therefore, it is said: "When the Great Way declined, benevolence and righteousness arose. When wisdom and knowledge emerged, great hypocrisy appeared. When the six family relationships were disharmonious, filial piety and kindness arose. When the state was chaotic, loyal ministers appeared." And also: "Ritual is the thinning of loyalty and trustworthiness, and the beginning of chaos." All these categories established by the sages relate to knowledge. If the people's intelligence is cut off and they are made ignorant (愚), they will naturally return to the correctness of filial piety, kindness, loyalty, and trustworthiness. Therefore, it is said: "Those in antiquity who were skilled in practicing the Way did not enlighten the people, but kept them ignorant. The difficulty in governing the people is due to their intelligence. Governing the state with intelligence is the state's misfortune; not governing the state with intelligence is the state's blessing." And also: "Abandon sageliness, discard wisdom, and the people will benefit a hundredfold. Abandon benevolence, discard righteousness, and the people will return to filial piety and kindness. Abandon skill, discard profit, and the people will return to filial piety and kindness [sic, likely error repeats 孝慈]." This shows the close relationship between politics and ethics, and its sole assumption is the absolute goodness of human nature. Ultimately, what the ruler should pay attention to lies solely in the people's will. When the people's will is not opposed, the world is without incident; this is called the government of non-action (無爲の政).

Political Theory (政治論)
(1) Political Theory: Lao Tzu said, "Tackle the difficult while it is still easy; accomplish the great while it is still small." Elaborating on this means that difficult affairs in the world necessarily arise from the easy, and great affairs in the world necessarily arise from the small. Also, he said, "If you wish to shrink it, you must first expand it. If you wish to weaken it, you must first strengthen it. If you wish to abolish it, you must first establish it." This is also nothing other than the meaning stated above, and the theory that the soft overcomes the hard (柔克 勝剛) is also based on this.
(2) Theory of Using Military Force (用兵論): Lao Tzu said, "Govern the state with correctness; use the military with surprise tactics." And also, "There is a saying concerning the use of military force: 'I dare not act as the host but prefer to act as the guest.'"
(3) Theory of Worldly Conduct (處世論): Lao Tzu said, "Is not the Way of Heaven like the drawing of a bow? The high is pulled down; the low is raised up. The excessive is reduced; the insufficient is supplemented. Heaven's Way reduces the excessive and supplements the insufficient. The way of humans is not so: it reduces the insufficient to give to the excessive. Who can reduce the excessive to serve the world? Therefore, the sage acts without relying on his own ability, achieves merit but does not dwell on it. He does not wish to appear worthy." This is the essence of his method for worldly conduct. Viewed from a certain perspective, this is nothing other than the theory that misfortune and fortune are intertwined.
In summary, Lao Tzu confirmed the mutual accompaniment of yin (陰) and yang (陽) and used this to formulate policies, military strategies, and methods for worldly conduct.

Conclusion
Lao Tzu's fundamental principle is the Way (道). The Way is the Absolute that governs everything. Therefore, governing the state and ruling the people should solely be entrusted to the Way. Knowledge and the like can all be discarded. However, the Absolute transcends the relative, and the relative is the state of the phenomenal world. It should be known that the relative world is governed by contradictory laws. <28> From this, he deduced the methods for policy, military strategy, and worldly conduct.

Lieh Tzu (列子) (Legend and Book)
Lieh Tzu's name was [Yük'ou? *冠] (御寇); he was a man of Zheng (鄭). He lived around 72 years after Confucius's death (during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods). While residing in Zheng, someone mentioned his worthiness to the Prime Minister of Zheng, Tzu-yang (子陽). Tzu-yang sent millet via an official. Lieh Tzu bowed twice, met the envoy, and declined it. The envoy, unable to insist, returned immediately. When Lieh Tzu went inside, his wife saw this and said, "I have heard that the wives of those who possess the Way all attain ease and pleasure. Now, I show signs of hunger, yet thankfully, the Prime Minister of Zheng sent food to you, Sir, but you did not accept it. How can this be fate?" Lieh Tzu laughed and said, "The Prime Minister of Zheng did not know me himself but merely sent me millet based on others' words. He might also find fault with me based on others' words. Therefore, I did not accept it." From this one word and one action, his character can be known. He lived in Zheng for 40 years. When a famine occurred in the state of Zheng, he went to [Heng? 衡], then later went to Qi (齊). His end is unknown.

Philosophy (哲學)
Theory of Life's Origin (生處論): The Way is formless (無形). Formless does not mean it has no substance, but has the meaning of emptiness (空虛). How could such an empty entity generate all myriad things? Reaching this point, Lieh Tzu established various stages between existence (有) and non-existence (無) to bring these two distinctly separated concepts closer. The sequence progressing from non-existence to existence is called Great Change (太易), Great Beginning (太初), Great Origin (太始), and Great Simplicity (太素). Great Change is when vital energy (氣) is not yet seen. Great Beginning is the start of vital energy. Great Origin is the start of form (形). Great Simplicity is the start of substance (質) [error, likely meant 質之始, start of substance]. When vital energy, form, and substance are complete but not yet separated, it is called 'Primordial Chaos' (運淪, 混淪). Primordial Chaos is the state where all things are mixed together and unseparated. This is described as "Wishing to see it, it cannot be seen; wishing to hear it, it cannot be heard; wishing to grasp it, it cannot be obtained." Therefore, it is called Change (易). Change refers to that which has no fixed form. Lieh Tzu further indicated the sequence, saying, "Change transforms into One; One transforms into Seven; Seven transforms into Nine." This provides the principle by which all things are generated. After this, the myriad things are generated. However, the generation of myriad things occurs at specific times and spaces, each having its fixed allotment (定分). Heaven has aspects where it is lacking; Earth has aspects where it is excelling. That which shelters and covers cannot bear forms; that which bears forms cannot transform and nurture. The Way of Heaven and Earth is either yang or yin. The teaching of the sages is either benevolence or righteousness. The proper state of myriad things is either soft or hard. All follow what they are suited for and cannot exceed their assigned positions.

Theory of Determinism (定命論): The generation of myriad things is thus governed by the Way, and each has its own fixed allotment. This is not accidental but necessary (必然的). In response to this, it must be said that the fate (命) of myriad things is fixed. For example, life and death are sufficient to be the clearest evidence. It is said, "Life is that which must logically end. The ending cannot but end, just as one knows that the living cannot but live. To desire to prolong life indefinitely, to delay the end, is to be confused about the category." Pursuing this thought, Lieh Tzu advocated absolute determinism. To elaborate, <29> even things arising from human will are all secretly determined by Heavenly Mandate (天命). For instance, statements like "Pao Shu (鮑叔) was not [just] capable of promoting the worthy, he could not but promote him; Duke Hsiao-pai (小白) was not [just] capable of employing his enemy, he could not but employ him" view human action as existing within nature. Therefore, in his "Signs from Heaven" (天瑞) chapter, he explains mysteriously generated transformations and concludes with the phrase, "All things emerge from the cosmic mechanism (機), all things return to the cosmic mechanism."

The Illusion of Possession (有의 妄見): Since all myriad things are thus necessarily governed by the Absolute, viewed from this perspective, the movement of the universe flows on endlessly like water, never ceasing. It is simply so of itself. Naturally, in this state of being so, there is non-discrimination and equality, making it impossible to establish distinctions between self and other. Therefore, within the cosmic process, there is only the non-egoistic, only things happening naturally. He clarified this meaning through the dialogue between Shun (舜) and Ch'eng (蒸) [likely 氶, Cheng]: "Shun asked Cheng, 'Can the Way be obtained and possessed?' Cheng replied, 'Your body is not possessed by you; how then can you possess the Way?' Shun said, 'If my body is not my own, who possesses it?' Cheng replied, 'It is the form entrusted by Heaven and Earth. Life is not possessed by you; it is the harmony entrusted by Heaven and Earth. Nature and destiny are not possessed by you; they are the compliance entrusted by Heaven and Earth. Therefore, in movement, you know not where you stop; in stillness, you know not what you hold; in eating, you know not the reason. It is Heaven and Earth compelling yin and yang. How then can you obtain and possess it?'" Ultimately, Lieh Tzu pointed to those who claim natural things as their own possessions as thieves (盜).

Self-Cultivation (修身論) (The Goal of Cultivation is the Absolute)
This involves shattering the illusory view that pits nature against human artifice, returning everything to the same Nature. The primary effort in self-cultivation lies in eliminating the view of 'self' (我見). Why? Because there is no distinction between other and self. Therefore, it is said, "One who trusts in fate has no divided mind between other and self." And, "Lieh Tzu studied for nine years. Whatever his mind thought, whatever his mouth spoke, he no longer knew whether it was right or wrong, beneficial or harmful for himself, nor whether it was right or wrong, beneficial or harmful for others. When inside and outside merged, then the eye became like the ear, the ear like the nose, the nose like the mouth – nothing was different." What can be called Lieh Tzu's thought is即身絶對的 (the body itself is absolute). This is a point of major similarity and minor difference with Lao Tzu. Lao Tzu also considered letting things be according to nature as appropriate, but this was based on the assumption of the goodness of human nature. Therefore, his teachings are social. However, what Lieh Tzu advocated was complete surrender to physical nature, thus it is not social. That is, it lies in making one's own body absolute. In this point, he differs from Yang Tzu (楊子). Yang Tzu sought to bring pleasure to his own body, while Lieh Tzu idealized the body itself as absolute.

The Effort of Cultivation (修爲의 工夫): Reaching this realm involves taking 'no-mind' (無心) as the sole effort. Why? It is said: There was a man by the seashore who loved seagulls (漚鳥). Every morning he went to the sea and played among the seagulls, and innumerable seagulls came close to him. One day, his father ordered him to catch them. When he went to the sea, not a single seagull came near. This is because he harbored the intention to catch them, and natural creation responded accordingly. If there is no intention, humans and things will naturally interact. This self, being without mind, serene and natural, <30> entrusts itself to Nature, thereby not violating the laws of Nature. The essence of Lieh Tzu's effort lies solely in this. And Lieh Tzu said, "To be able to live when one should live is Heaven's blessing. To be able to die when one should die is Heaven's blessing." From this, the location of his fundamental thought can be seen.

Conclusion
In essence, Lieh Tzu assumed the necessary progression of the universe and set the goal of self-cultivation as reaching the realm of absolute egolessness solely through the mind. His discussion of determinism, like Yang Chu's, deserves significant attention. Several decades after Lieh Tzu, Chuang Tzu appeared and, by developing Lao Tzu's concepts of contradiction, greatly illuminated Chinese philosophy.

Chuang Tzu (莊子) (Legend and Book)
Chuang Tzu was a native of Meng (蒙) in the state of Sung (宋). He was roughly contemporary with Meng Tzu, living during the time of King Hsüan of Ch'i (齊宣王) and King Hui of Liang (梁惠王). His integrity was pure and refined, and he disdained accepting the favors of contemporary rulers to take office. Therefore, he said, "I would rather roam and amuse myself freely in poverty, lowliness, and mire than accept the fetters of those who hold states." In the end, he did not serve in office. His end is unknown. Chuang Tzu's writings, 32 chapters, are transmitted today. During the reign of Emperor [Hsüan-tsung of T'ang, Li Lung-chi? 李虎], Chuang Tzu's book was named the Nanhua Zhenjing (南華眞經, True Scripture of Nanhua).

Logic (論理學)
(1) All concepts invariably presuppose definition. Definition refers to specifically abstracting something, belonging to the function of the 'I' as subject. Applying this more concretely yields the following four pairs of principles:
(1) Left and Right (左右) (2) Argument and Logic (論理) (3) Distinction and Discrimination (分辨) (4) Competition and Contention (競爭). Chuang Tzu named these the "Eight Virtues" (八德). All concepts of 'this' and 'that' under Heaven can be subsumed within these.
(2) When any thing under Heaven is defined, it stands in mutual opposition, contradictory to the negation of the other. Thus, the same definition, i.e., the thing, is viewed from two aspects. Chuang Tzu clarified this concept with the principle of "three [nuts] in the morning, four in the evening" (朝三暮四): "A monkey keeper distributing acorns to the monkeys said, 'I will give you three in the morning and four in the evening.' All the monkeys became angry. The keeper then said, 'Alright, I will give you four in the morning and three in the evening.' All the monkeys were pleased. Though the name and reality did not change, one group was pleased and the other angry because they clung to one side of the contradiction as correct."
(3) That which transcends this contradictory relativity is called the Way (道). The Way is the Absolute, i.e., non-discrimination, equality. Therefore, "When 'that' and 'this' cease to be opposites, that is called the pivot of the Way (道樞)." [Original quote slightly different: 彼是莫得其偶 謂之道樞]
(4) Chuang Tzu applied this concept of contradictory relativity to dreams to form a kind of life philosophy, saying: "Once, Chuang Chou (莊周) dreamed he was a butterfly (蝴蹀), fluttering happily and contentedly, the state of joy difficult to describe in words. Chou forgot he was Chou. Suddenly, he awoke, and he was abruptly <31> Chou. Then, was it Chou dreaming he was a butterfly, or was it a butterfly dreaming it was Chou? 'Life is ultimately but a spring dream.'" And also, "Waking and dreaming mutually presuppose each other. Only after waking does one know it was a dream. How can we know that what we now call waking is not also another dream? Ultimately, life and death are mutually presupposing. Calling the time of life 'waking' is because one experiences night dreams relative to being alive. Thus, relative to life, must not death be called the Great Awakening?"

Self-Cultivation (修身論)
The goal of self-cultivation lies in dwelling firmly in the Absolute. To elaborate, it lies first in knowing that the Absolute transcends the relative, and then settling the heart-mind (心意) in this realm. One whose heart-mind is settled in that realm is called a 'Reached Person' (達人), 'True Person' (眞人), or 'Perfected Person' (至人), and their virtue (德) is vast and immeasurable. Chuang Tzu clearly distinguished between mind (心) and form (形), saying: "Virtue has its strengths, form has its forgettings. The goal of self-cultivation lies in the heart-mind, regardless of the form." The actions of a person whose heart-mind dwells in the realm of the Absolute are also unconscious, i.e., natural, and conform to principle (理法).

Conclusion
Chuang Tzu wielded the brush of the great P'eng bird (鵬大) to draft the "Free and Easy Wandering" (逍遙) chapter. The key point lies in the two characters "Grand View" (大觀). On one hand, Chuang Tzu's philosophical principles can be known; on the other hand, his scholarly style can be understood. Therefore, I discuss this here in place of a conclusion.
All the affairs of human society, where people chirp and chatter, living together in mixed confusion, exist entirely in the realm of comparison and relativity. The quail (斥鶡) flitting among branches, the dove (鳩鶩) hiding among leaves, some flying a few feet, others soaring three feet, chirping contentedly with each other, grieving melancholically with each other – human actions and words are all just like this. If so, we should ascend to the height of the great P'eng bird, ninety thousand li high. Carrying the blue sky on our back, we must be able to act with complete freedom. This is what is called "Riding upon the correctness of Heaven and Earth, managing the differentiations of the six vital energies, to roam in the infinite." This is precisely the realm of the Absolute, which should not fall into the scope of definition like the human world.

丁. Yang School (楊家)
Yang Tzu (楊子) (Legend and Book)
Yang Tzu's given name was Chu (朱). His biography is not detailed, but seeing that Meng Tzu spent his entire life refuting Yang and Mo, we can know that Yang Tzu's doctrines were widespread throughout the world at that time, forming factions. Consequently, it is clear that Yang Tzu's era preceded Meng Tzu and was slightly after Mo Tzu. The Huainanzi discussed Yang Tzu, saying: "Cherishing one's nature and protecting one's authenticity, not letting external things encumber one's form—this is what Yang Tzu established." Therefore, he cannot be omitted from the history of Chinese philosophy. <32>

Philosophy (哲學)
Theory of Universal Determinism (萬物定命論): All phenomena do not arise and perish on their own. In other words, the life, death, existence, and extinction of myriad things cannot be controlled by one's own will; they are all related solely to Heaven, Earth, and Nature. Therefore, it is said: "Worthiness or foolishness, nobility or baseness are not within one's capacity [to determine]. Decay, putrefaction, and annihilation are also not within one's capacity. Therefore, life is not something one brings about; death is not something one brings about. Worthiness is not something one makes oneself; foolishness is not something one makes oneself. Nobility is not something one makes oneself; baseness is not something one makes oneself. Yet all things are equally born, equally die, equally worthy, equally foolish, equally noble, equally base. Dying in ten years or dying in a hundred years [is still death]." However, while myriad things exist, they are not merely distinguishable from each other; when it comes to their death, they all return to the soil, which is one and the same. Therefore, it is said: "Alive, Yao and Shun; dead, rotten bones. Alive, Chieh and Chou; dead, rotten bones—it is all the same." Myriad things exist with differences, yet they also have a natural, fixed destiny. This is evident in the question posed to Meng Tzu [sic, likely refers to a text illustrating Yang Chu's views, not a direct quote from Meng Tzu asking Yang Chu]: "Suppose there is a person here who values life and cherishes his body, hoping thereby not to die. Is this possible? It is said: 'In reality, there is no escaping death.' Hoping thereby to live long. Is this possible? In reality, there is no living long. Life is not something that valuing it can preserve, nor is it something that cherishing it can enrich." This is Yang Tzu's theory of universal determinism.
Yang Tzu did not attribute the cause of universal determinism to spirits (神) but solely based it on establishing a view of nature. Then, what did he deduce from his fundamental thought of universal determinism?
(1) Hedonism (快樂主義). Life is like the morning dew; death is the same for all. Even sages like Yao and Shun, upon death, simply decay. Even wicked tyrants like Chieh and Chou, upon death, simply decay, ultimately becoming soil. This stems from a kind of world-weary view derived from the determinism of all things. As a reaction to this view, hedonism emerged. Ultimately, Yang Tzu was thoroughly world-weary. His words say: "The suffering and pleasure of worldly affairs were the same in antiquity as now. Changes in governance and chaos were the same in antiquity as now. Having heard of it and seen it, even a hundred years feels too long to endure. How much more the suffering of a long life?"
(2) The Harm of Suicide (自殺의 害). Since all things have a fixed destiny, fulfilling this destiny is our fundamental duty. Yang Tzu said: "While alive, let go and allow things to take their course, pursuing desires to the utmost while awaiting death. When about to die, let go and allow things to take their course, pursuing the path to the end, letting go completely. Let go of everything, allow everything. Why hasten or delay in this matter?"
(3) Objectification of the Body (肉體의 客觀). As a result of the theory of universal determinism, Yang Tzu also viewed his physical body objectively. Therefore, he said: "The body is not mine" (身非我有也). As a result of disregarding the body in this way, he eventually came to treat funeral rites lightly. However, on the other hand, he also perceived that human competition is not based on brute force but necessarily on intelligence (智力). Therefore, his words state: "The value of intelligence lies in preserving oneself; the baseness of force lies in encroaching upon others." Along with this, he sought solely to ensure his own existence through intelligence.

Conclusion
Yang Tzu's fundamental thought is retreatism (隱退主義) (individualism). However, his doctrines ultimately did not reach the lofty heights of Lao Tzu's, merely advocating "shedding fame to be without worry" (去名無憂) (not taking the name of 'so-and-so'). It directly conflicts with socialism, advocating individualistic independence and also individualistic hedonism. This is the direct opposite of Mo Tzu.

**Summary**

This article segment by Kang Ch'unsan analyzes several key figures in classical Chinese philosophy beyond Confucianism, focusing on Mo Tzu, Lao Tzu, Lieh Tzu, Chuang Tzu, and Yang Tzu. It outlines Mo Tzu's concepts of 'universal love' (兼愛) and 'benefit' (利), defending him against Meng Tzu's criticisms by highlighting similarities with Confucian ethics and the practical intent behind his ideas like moderation. It then discusses Lao Tzu's concept of the absolute 'Tao' (道), non-action (無爲), and paradoxical logic. Lieh Tzu is presented as an advocate of absolute determinism (定命論) and achieving a state of 'no-mind' (無心). Chuang Tzu's philosophy is explored through the lens of relativity, the illusory nature of distinctions (like waking/dreaming, life/death), and achieving absolute freedom by transcending relative viewpoints ('Grand View' 大觀). Finally, Yang Tzu is depicted as a proponent of determinism leading to individualism and hedonism, focusing on self-preservation ('cherishing life' 全性保眞) as the logical response to inescapable fate, contrasting sharply with Mo Tzu's altruism.

From a historical perspective, this 1921 article is interesting as it shows Korean intellectuals actively engaging with and re-interpreting classical East Asian thought during the colonial period. Kang Ch'unsan's defense of Mo Tzu, a figure often marginalized in the dominant Confucian tradition, and his attempt to systematize these diverse 'non-mainstream' philosophies ('Eastern Moral Philosophy' 東洋道學) reflect an effort to find alternative intellectual resources and perhaps subtly critique established hierarchies or contemporary social issues through historical analogy. The focus on Mo Tzu's practicality, patriotism (愛國), and social concern, alongside the Daoist critiques of convention, might have resonated with intellectuals seeking new frameworks during a period of national crisis and social change.

東洋道學의 體系 如何
						姜春山
乙. 墨家
墨子
孟子가 墨子를 排斥한 以後로 學者 等은 盲目的으로 此를 因襲하야 墨子를 崇拜한 者- 鮮하여다. 그러나 墨子의 書를 讀한 者- 면 誰가 愛國의 精神이 全篇에 貫徹하엿다. 講치 안흐리 有하랴. 其言에 曰 『凡人國必擇務而從事焉 國家昏亂則語之尙賢尙同 國家*則語之節用節葬 國家喜音**則語之非樂非命 國家淫僻無禮則語之尊天事鬼 國家務奪侵凌則 語之兼愛』라 하엿스니 그 著作한 바는 크다. 社會的 眼光으로부터 觀察된 者니라. 그리고 그 主要한 者는 即 天利, 鬼利, 人利인 바 遊說의 中에 此로써 應치 안임이 無하니라.
墨子의 年代는 其說이 不一하나 吾人의 所見이 孟子의 言으로써  準據하면 孟子 曰 『 聖王不作, 諸侯放恣, 虛士橫議, 朱墨之言, *天下 天下之言 不歸楊則歸墨』이라 하엿스니 是로 由하야 觀하면 孟子 當時에 在하야 楊*의 徒는 天下에 滿하야 盛히 其說을 鼓吹한 者-라 할지로다. 然則 墨子는 孟子 一代以上의 人이 될지어 又 他 證據를 募集하여 본즉 孔子 沒後 47年頃이 될만하다.

學說 愛-利-非命說
1. 愛이니 무릇 社會에 競爭이 生하며 戰鬪가 有함은 모다 衝突로써 吾人의 憎惡觀念에 伴한 者-라. 그럼으로 吾人의 精神內로부터 此 觀念을 根本的 除却할 時는 大夫- 君을 不犯하며 子- 父를 不逆하며 딸아서 敵國 相制의 懼가 每히 天下安寧의 幸福을 可得할지라. 然한데 今若愛와 憎과를 對立케 하고 其一을 排斥하기는 到底히 能치 못한다. 何者오 하면 此 兩者는 互相 豫想한 것임으로 其一만 取함은 自然 矛盾의 事됨을 免치 못함으로써라.
試着하라. 愛하는 一個 觀念下에서 人을 殺하고 財를 奪하야 自己를 利코저 함이 아닌가. 그럼으로 己를 愛하는 念은 如前히 存케 하고 人을 惡하는 念만 取去코저 하면 到底不可의 事니라. 人을 惡하는 念을 除去코저 하면 爲先 愛의 念으로써 相對的 되는 憎愛二觀念의 上에 立케 함만 莫如하다.＜22＞ 詳言하면 彼와 此와를 同時에 愛하는 愛를 兼愛라 한다. 말미어 絶對의 愛는 天下로 하야곰 泰平케 하는 能力이 有하니 曰 『天下兼相愛則治 相惡則亂』이라 하얏고 又 曰 愛無厚薄이라 하엿스니 想必 墨子는 또한 無差別의 愛와 差別의 愛와 精密히 區別하야 以爲하되 愛는 大小遠近의 區別이 無하야 所謂 人을 愛한다 함은 普遍的으로 愛하는 者이오. 決코 彼를 愛하고 此를 愛한다 함이 아니라. 그리하야 人을 愛한다 함은 一切의 人을 愛함으로써- 니 卽 普遍的의 愛는 此를 周愛라 할지라. 如斯히 若愛로써 結合하는 觀念이라 하야 無差別 平等의 愛라 하니 그야말로 社會는 果然 無差別이 될는지 또는 先人의 倫理法則은 如何하겟다 할가. 然한 즉 愛의 外에 差別의 原理가 無치 못할지니 此를 恭이 有하야 社會의 一切法則을 그에 由하야 成立할 만한 基礎를 得한다 하면 此等을 如何히 說明하여야 可할가 次에 論究하면
倫理的 法則 無差別의 平面에서 愛가 有하며 差別에 由하야 發生할 만한 條件으로써 恭이 有하다 하니 故로 一切의 倫理的 法則은 愛의 觀念으로 演繹치 아님이 不可하니라. 만일 人이 人의 身을 見함을 己와 如히 하며 人의 患을 見함을 己의 憂와 如히 할 時는 誰가 人을 害하며 人을 賊할 念이 起할가. 그런데 論理의 網領이 二가 有하니 (1) 人을 害할 念을 絶 할 것 (二)人의 急을 救하는 義가 存함. 진실로 此 法則이 有하면 天下- 何時라도 爭亂의 事- 決無할지니라.
大抵人의 國을 伐하며 人의 君을 誅함은 是- 그 國을 害함이 아니며 그 君을 憎함이 아니오. 오즉 天下의 害를 際코저 함이라. 更言하면 天下의 害를 加하는 者는 旣히 社會의 根柢 되는 無差別의 觀念에 背한 者임으로써 社會의 中에 存在치 못할 者이라. 故로 此를 討伐 함은 人을 惡함이 아니오. 單히 그 害를 除코저 함이엇다. 後世의 學者들은 墨子의 思想이 旣히 此 最高域에 達함을 不顧하고 惟其愛로써 差別的 愛만 高等이라 하야 墨子를 社會平等主義의 主唱者라 하야 絶對 排斥하니 孟子와 如한 者- 그 一人이라. 故로 墨子를 指하야 曰 無父無君은 是 禽獸라 하엿스니 吾人은 墨子를 爲하야 一言으로써 辯明치 아니치 못할지니 墨子 曰 『 今天下之君子 忠實欲天下之富 而惡其貧 欲天下之治 而惡其亂 當兼相愛 交相利 此聖王之法 天下之治道也 不可不務爲也』 라 하니 此 卽 兼愛는 先王으로 旣히 自體된 바를 云함이라. 墨子는 又 曰 『孝子之爲親度者 吾不識 孝子之爲親度者 亦欲人愛其親者歟 抑亦欲人惡賊其親者歟』라 하엿스니 此卽 親을 愛하는 자는 또 他人의 親을 愛치 아니치 못하겟다 함이로다. ＜23＞ 然하면 墨子는 一步를 進하야 愛로 하여곰 互相의 關係를 律하는 者로 認함과 共히 當時 時勢緩急의 所在를 洞察한 자라. 말미어 墨子의 墨子된 所以는 實로 此에 在하나니 卽 我가 我家를 愛하면 딸아서 我의 家를 害치 아닐 것이오. 他人의 家를 愛하면 딸아서 他人의 家를 害치 안흘지니 此 則 墨子의 根本的 觀念으로 所謂 兼愛는 無差別平等이로다. 一言으로 蔽하면 墨子의 書를 讀한 자는 如何히 疎漏한 讀書家라도 倫理的 法則에 對하야 毫末도 儒敎와 異한 바- 無함을 認定할지로다.

2. 曰 利이니 墨子는 愛의 외에 大한 主義를 律示하엿스니 此를 利라 한다. 利는 社會의 維持된 바 基底니라. 墨子는 常히 愛利를 竝稱提擧하야 曰 愛之利之라 한 바 그 利라 함은 物質的 勢力에 不外하니라 써한 바 物質的 勢力이 有한 故로 社會는 此로써 保持되나니 故로 此勢力은 그 殖增法을 謹치 아님이 不可하니 此를 誤할 時는 愈愈滅殺될 뿐이며 此를 謹할 時는 愈愈增長할지니 人口의 繁殖과 生活의 潤澤은 全혀 此에 在하니라. 然한 즉 利란 者는 『上利乎天 中利乎鬼 下利乎人』이니 此를 增進함은 人生의 快樂을 進步하고 人文의 進化를 助長케 하는 者로다.
利의 觀念 演繹 利로써 社會의 具體的 腦髓라 하고 聖人의 奬勵할 處이라 하니 此로부터 種種의 結果가 伴生한다.
(1)節葬  墨子 曰 『 古者聖賢節葬之法 衣三領足以朽肉 棺三寸 足以朽骨 掘穴深不通於泉 流不發洩則止』라 하다. 此는 實로 墨子가 薄喪을 主張한 바 根本的 思想이라. 此는 儒敎의 繁禮虛飾으로 當時 葬禮가 侯王으로부터 庶民에 至히 넘우 驕奢에 流하야 衰亡에 入함을 見하고 慷慨悲憤하야 此言을 發함에 至함이며 그 外에도 薄葬을 主張한 理가 有하나 此에 畧한다. 또 墨子의 修身篇에 曰 『喪雖有體나以哀爲本』이라 하니 是等의 點을 綜合하야 思考하여 보면 墨子의 思想은 『禮與其奢也 寧儉 喪與其易也 寧戚』이란 孔子의 言과 一致하다. 말미어 墨子의 主張은 節葬이라 할가망정 薄葬이라 함은 甚不可하다.
(2)節用 墨子는 獨히 葬을 節케 할 뿐만 아니라 一切 社會에 利益이 有한 者면 此를 節케 하고저 하엿스니 曰 『古者之民始生也 處於丘陵 聖王爲之慮 使之掘穴以處 更進一步 使之營宮室而避風雨 使之淸潔而行祭祀 此乃先王之爲民便利也 故聖王無利 不爲也』이라 하고 又 曰 『無用의 道를 去하야 民利를 補하여야 天下의 大利』 라 하얏스니 是로 由하야 觀하면 經濟的 生産에 無用한 者는 一切 此를 棄코저 하엿도다.＜24＞
(3)非樂 先王이 音樂을 用함은 人心을 陶治하야 天下로 하여곰 一治의 下에 歸케 하고저 目的함이어늘 後世 君王은 不然하야 自己의 業務를 廢하고 全혀 音樂歌舞鐘鼓의 間에 放逸하니 此- 墨子의 痛斥한 바이며 獨君子에 對하야 其然할 뿐 아니라 男子는 音樂에 取하야 畊作의 業을 怠하고 宮任의 務를 忘하며 女子는 音樂에 取함으로써 職任을 棄하고 桑茶를 排하며 말미어 鄭聲, 衛音과 如함은 風俗을 壞亂하고 人心을 腐爛케 함에 至하나니 是 皆 音樂의 弊이라. 此- 墨子의 最히 痛斥한 點이로다.
要컨대 愛利는 天의 本意라 할지니 天의 欲하는 바는 오즉 愛와 利-며 惡하는 바는 此에 反한 一切의 者-라. 何로써 그 然함을 知하는가? 天은 兼으로써 人을 愛하고 同時에 人을 利케 함으로써 知하는도다. 그럼으로 人을 愛하고 利케 하는 者는 此에 반듯이 福을 與하고 人을 惡하고 人을 賊하는 者는 此에 반듯이 禍를 降하나니 此로써 觀하면 墨子에서 天의 存在를 證할 바는 左와 如하다.
(1)社會 全體로써 愛利를 受하는 事
(2)賞罰을 正中히 하는 事 이러케 墨子는 天을 證하야 此를 中國 儒道의 本義와 合케 하얏스니 墨子의 天은 頻히 正當하다. 孔子 曰 『惟天爲大 惟堯則之』라 함과 如히 墨子는 亦 法儀란 一章을 設하야 天에 則할 만한 法을 論曰 天下事에 從하는 者- 法儀가 無치 못할 지라. 然하면 何處에 何法할가. 惟天이 有할 뿐인 바 天의 天된 德에 三이 有하니
(1)行  廣하야 私가 無함.
(2)施  厚하야 德이 大함.
(3)明  久하야 不衰함. 如斯한 普遍的 恒久的 光明的의 行은 吾人 人類의 能할 바- 아니니  故로 聖王은 此를 則하엿다 한다.

3. 曰 非命說이니 吾人의 所行은 곳 天意의 所在-며 天意의 所在는 곳 義의 所在라 日常의 如何한 少事라도 天意에 從하야 動行치 안흠이 不可하다. 世人의 或은 墨子로써 効利說이라 云하는 者- 有하나 實際는 不然하다. 墨子의 有命을 排斥한 所以는 宇宙의 原理로써 愛利의 二를 立하고 此로부터 倫理的 法則 及 社會的 習慣을 演釋하엇스니 卽 法則, 習慣의 兩者- 原理의 必然함과 共히 必然이며 恒久的 됨과 共히 恒久的인 此로써 그 行動을 一定의 準則한 바니라. 그럼으로 天命說은 是 不可하도다. 오즉 天意에 順한 者면 天이 必賞하고 不順한 자면 天이 此를 必罰할 뿐이나 然한데 墨子의 非命說은 主要히 政治的 意味에 對함과 如하다. 무릇 有命을 執한 자의 言에 曰 『命이 富하면 즉 富하고 命이 貧하면 卽 貧하며 命이 衆하면＜25＞ 곳 衆하고 命이 寡하면 곳 寡하며 命이 治하고 亂하면 곳 治하고 亂하며 命이 壽하고 天하면 곳 壽하고 天한다』하니 若 此說로 民間에 盛케 하면 百姓은 그 業을 勉치 아니하며 百官은 그 職을 事치 아니하고 拱手待坐하야 皆曰 命이라 我가 如何히 措處하랴 하야 乃終 그 結果는 天下瘠貧하고 國家- 崩壞하야 遂히 濟키 不能할 境에 至할지니 此- 有命說의 害되는 所以라. 말미어 墨子는 極히 非命을 主唱한 바는 오즉 倫理的 法則과 社會的 習慣에 依하야 行動케 하고저 하얏슬 뿐이로다.

結論
墨子가 喪禮는 哀로써 本이라 言하며 或은 賢을 尙하고 士를 親함으로써 治國의 要라 云함과 如함은 毫末도 孔子와 異함이 無하다. 然則 墨子로 하여곰 孔子의 徒라 云하겟다 하노라. 淮南子 曰 『墨子學儒者 業受孔子之術 以爲其禮煩擾而不悅』 이라 하엿스니 此로써 見하더래도 墨子의 說은 孔子와 類似하야 非疑의 餘地가 無하거늘 不幸히 孟子는 激烈 排斥한 바 墨子를 爲하야 어찌 痛惜타 안흐리오. 大抵 孟子는 當時의 政治家니라. 딸아서 社會를 運用左右코저 하야 東西에 狂奔한 者인 바 老莊의 徒는 不然하야 世를 避하고 身을 善함으로써 自足한 一個의 哲學者며 隱君子일 것 뿐이니 孟子 等과 何等의 意味가 一致하랴.

丙. 道家 (仙敎는 晋國時 改名)
老子 (傳竝書)
老子의 姓은 李요 名은 耳요 字는 伯陽이니 其耳가 漫으로써 輪이 無한 고로 世號를 *이라 云하다. 史記에 據하면 楚의 苦縣人이니 今毫州谷陽縣人이라 然則 老子는 江北人됨은 無疑하나 周의 守*室吏가 되어 國書을 監督할 詩에 孔子-禮를 來問하니라. 그리고 周室이 瓦解함과 共히 人民이 土崩함을 見하고 惆惆然不樂하야 吏를 棄하고 西散關에 入하니 *人尹喜- 道를 問함에 對하야 드듸여 道德 五千餘言를 寫하여 주고 去하니라.

學說
孔子는 旣定的 된 禮에 由하야 社會를 經論코저 하고 老子는 人性의 自然에 任하야 天下를 治코저 하엿나니 孔老 二子는 此點에서 大한 間隔이 生하니라. 孔子의 思想은 그 端을 社會的 倫理思想에 發하고 老子의 思想은 그 端을 非社會的 自然思潮에 發하엿다. 그런데 老子와 孔子는 共히 그 思想의 端을 堯舜의 時로 發端하야 점차 下降하다가 二子에 至하야 遂히 大成하엿슴이 無疑하도다.
從來 老子學의 源淵에 關하야는 諸說이 不一하다. (1)은 曰 周易에 本하엿나니 곳 前漢의 嚴遵 隋의 王績 宋의 邵康節 *說之 物徂徠의 徒가 是-라. 그 根據한 바는＜26＞ 老子의 思想과 易의 思想이 類似함으로써- 라. (2)는 曰 容成에 本하엿다. 然이나 容成은 何許됨을 不知하겟도다. 呂賢列子 韓詩外傳 등이 各其說이 不一하니라. (3)은 曰 史官에서 出하엿나니 此는 漢書 藝文志에 有한 바 『以爲歷記 成敗 存亡 禍福 古今之道然後 知秉要執本 淸虛以自守 卑弱以自持』 라 하니 此說을 論한 史官은 何者됨을 不知할 지로다. 夫魏晉의 際에 盛行한 淸談者流는 皆 虛無論의 實行者됨을 思하면 반듯이 本辯이 不誤하니라.
純正 哲學 孔子가 道로써 先王의 制作한 禮라 함에 反하야 老子는 道로써 一定하고 名狀키  不可한 者-라 하엿나니 一定의 道라 指示하고 一定의 名으로써 聞知할 만한 者는 決코 皆常道常名이 아니라 常道常名은 萬古不磨하는 자니라. 彼- 名狀하야 得할 만한 者는 決코 萬古不磨할 者- 아니르다. 例하면 此를 美타 할 時는 天下의 人을 擧하야 皆- 美타 할지라도 그 美는 不美에 對한 豫想的인 故로 決코 眞美가 아니며 此를 善타 云함도 亦然하니 天下의 人이 皆善이라 할지라도 此善은 惡에 대한 善임으로써  決코 眞善이 아님이 明白하다 하나니 老子의 此 思想은 곳 此를 指名하야 命名한 者로 他를 豫想하야 成하엿다는 思想은 彼가 處世論과 밋 用兵論의 根本思想이니라. 故로 老子의 道는 相對의 域을 超越한 絶對로써 毫末도 名狀키 不可한 者니라. 道는 如斯히 名狀키 不可하나 無치 아님이 아니라 故로 此를 形容하야 曰 『道之爲物 惟恍惟惚 恍兮惚兮 其中有物 窮兮冥兮其中有精 其精甚精 其中有信』 이라 하엿스니 그 意의 所在를 察하건대 道는 一切 萬物을 包含하엿스나 그러나 規定한 者- 아니라 함에 不外하도다.
老子는 道로써 靜的 虛的 또는 無的으로 寫象하엿다. 何者오 하면 道는 永久不變의 體로써 一切萬化를 能爲하나 究竟 그 㯙迹을 見키 不可함으로써 -며 又 老子는 萬物 체로써 虛靜하야 無한 者-라 하엿스니 故로 萬物로써 그 自然에 任할 時는 自然히 虛靜無에 復無할 者-라 하엿스니 曰 『致虛靜 守靜篤 萬物竝作 吾以觀其後 夫物芸芸 *歸其根 歸根曰靜 靜曰復命 復命曰常 常曰明』 이라 하엿다. 是則 老子의 政治論 及 倫理論의 根本思想이니라.

實踐 哲學
倫理論倂政治論 太古 純*의 時는 道의 完全無缺히 社會에 實現된 時니라. 人民은 何等의 知識이 無하되 그 生을 得하고 그 生을 終할 뿐이다. 그 聖人이란 자- 出하야 ＜27＞ 仁, 義, 忠, 信, 孝, 慈, 禮, 樂 等의 條目을 作하니 此에서 비롯오 民이 趨向할 바를 知하고 딸아서 是非善惡의 別을 始判하나니 於是乎不孝 가 有하며 不忠이 有하며 不慈非體가 有하야 天下는 此로 由하야 亂하엿다. 故로 曰 『大道廢 仁義出 知慧出 有大僞 六親不和 有孝慈 國家混亂有忠臣』이라 하고 又曰 『夫體者 忠信之薄而亂之道也』라 하엿다. 凡聖人의 建設한 此等 名目은 皆 知識에 關한 者로써 人民의 智를 斷絶하야 此를 愚케 할 時는 自然히 孝慈忠信의 正에 復할지라. 故로 曰 『古之善爲道者 非以明民 將以愚民 民之難治 以其智力 以智治國 國之賊 不以智治國 國之福』이라 하고 又曰 『絶聖棄知 民利百倍 絶仁棄義 民復孝慈 絶巧棄利 民復孝慈』라 하엿나니 是卽 政治와 倫理와의 密接 關係한 所以로써 그의 惟一 假定은 人性의 絶對善이니 말미어 人主의 注意할 바는 오즉 人民의 意에 在한 바 人意에 在한 바를 不忤할 時는 곳 天下- 無事하야 此를 無爲의 政이라 云한다.

政治論
(1)政治論 老子曰 『圖難於其易 爲大於其細』라 하다. 此를 更演하면 卽 天下의 難事는 必히 易에서 成하고 天下의 大事는 必히 細에서 作한다 함이오. 又 曰 『將欲翁之必固張之 將欲弱之必固强之 將欲廢之必固興之』 라 하니 此亦 上述의 意에 不外한 바 柔克 勝剛의 說도 亦此에 本하다.
(2)用兵論 老子曰 『以政治國 以奇用兵』이라 하고 又曰 『用兵有言 吾不敢爲主爲客』 이라 하니라.
(3)處世論 老子曰 『天之道 其猶弓乎 高者 抑之 下者擧之 有餘者損之 不足者補之 損有餘而補不足 人之道則不然 損不足 以奉有餘 不能損有餘 以奉天下 是以聖人爲而不恃 功成而不居 其不欲見賢』 이라 하니 是 卽 彼- 處世法의 要訣이라. 此를 어떤 方面으로부터 보면 禍福相緣의 說에 不外하도다.
要컨대 老子는 陰과 陽의 相伴함을 確認하고 此로써 政策, 用兵, 處世術을 成하엿도다.

結論
老子의 根本原理는 卽 道-니 道는 絶對로써 一切를 司配하는 者라. 故로 國을 治하며 人民을 統함이 惟一道에 委任할 것 뿐이오. 知識과 如함은 一切 此를 廢하여도 可할지로다. 然한데 絶對는 相對를 超越하고 相對는 現像界의 狀態-라. 相對界는 矛盾的 法則에 由하야 司配됨을＜28＞ 知할지니 此로써 政策, 用兵, 處世의 法을 演繹하엿도다.

列子(傳倂書)
列子의 名은 *冠-니 鄭人이라. 孔子 死後 72年 (春秋戰國 時)頃의 人이니 鄭에 居할 時에 人이 此를 鄭相子陽에게 其賢을 言한대 子陽이 官으로써 栗을 遺케 하엿더니 列子- 再拜하야 便者를 見하고 此를 辭한대 使者- 不得已 卽 還去하거늘 列子- 內에 入한대 其妻- 此를 見하고 謂曰 『吾聞*니 有 道者의 妻된 者는 皆 逸樂을 得한다 하더니 今妾은 饑色이 有하거늘 幸히 鄭相으로부터 先生에게 食을 遺함얘 先生으 不受하니 어찌 命이리오.』 한 대 列子 笑曰 『今鄭相이 我를 自知의 先分이 無하고 한갓 人의 言으로 我에게 栗을 遣하니 彼- 我를 罪함도 亦人의 言으로써 할지라. 故로 吾- 不受하엿다』 云하엿스니 此 一言一行으로써 能히 그 人格을 可知하겟도다. 그리고 鄭에 居한 지 40年에 鄭國의 饑함에 及하야 衡에 往하엿다가 又 齊에 去한 後 其終한 바는 不知하겟도다.

哲學
生處論 道는 無形이니 無形이라 함은 實體가 有함이 아니오. 空虛한 義니라. 如斯히 空虛한 者로써 一切 萬物을 如何히 生成하엿는가? 列子- 此에 至하야 有와 無의 間에 種種의 階程을 設하야 顯著히 懸隔한 二 槪念을 接近케 하엿스니 無로부터 有에 進하는 順序를 太易, 太初, 太始, 太素라 하니라. 太易이라 함은 아즉 氣를 不見한 者요. 太初는 氣의 始요. 太始는 形의 始며 太素는 氣의 始라. 氣形質만 具하고 아즉 離치 안한 者를 曰 運淪이라 하나니  混淪이라 함은 萬物이 相渾하야 離치 안한 狀態니라. 此는 卽 『欲見而不見 欲聽而無聽 欲循而不得』이라 하니 고로 曰 易이라. 易은 形이 埒치 아니한 자를 謂함이라. 列子가 更히 順序를 示하야 曰 『易變而爲一 一變而爲七 七變而爲九』라 하니 此乃 萬物을 生成한 바의 原理가 具備한 者-라. 然後에 萬物이 生成되는 도다. 然한데 萬物의 生成은 各各 時間, 空間을 特別히 하야 各自 定分이 有하니 天도 短한 所- 有하며 地도 長한 所- 有하고 生覆한 자는 形載할 事- 不能하고 形載한 者는 敎化할 事- 不能하니 天地의 道- 陽이 아니면 陰이오. 聖人의 敎- 仁이 아니면 義-며 萬物의 宜-柔가 아니면 剛이라. 다 그의 宣한 바에  隨하야 位한  바를 出키 不能하니라.
定命論 萬物의 生成은 如斯히 道에 由하야 司配되며 各各 自己의 定分이 有하니 是- 偶然한 者- 아니오 必然的이라. 是에 對하야 萬物의 命은 一定하다 謂치 안흘 수 업다. 例하면 生死와 如함은 最 明白한 事證됨에 足하도다. 曰 『 生者理之必終者也 終者不得不終 亦知生者之不得生 而欲恒其生 晝其終惑於類也』라 하나니 此思想을 推究하면 列子는 絶對的 定論을 主張한 者라 詳言하면 ＜29＞  人生의 意志에 出한 者라도 皆是 天命의 秘定이라 云한 事니라. 卽 『鮑叔非能擧賢不得不擧 小白非能用讎不得不用』이라 云함과 如히 人爲로써 自然의 中에 在하다 看做한 것이라. 故로 彼天瑞篇에 不可思議的 化生을 說하고 『萬物皆出於機, 皆入於機』의 一語로 此를 結하니라.
有의 妄見 一切 萬物은 如斯히 絶對에 由하야 必然的으로 司配된 者인 故로 此方面으로부터 見하면 宇宙의 進動은 滔滔하야 流水의 長去不盡함과 如하니 스스로 其然할 뿐이다. 自然 其者는 無差別 平等으로 彼此의 別을 立키 不可하도다. 故로 宇宙過程 中에서는 但我的이 無하고 自然히 될 뿐이라. 舜蒸問答에 託하야 此意를 明케하니 曰 『舜問于蒸曰道可得而有乎아 曰 汝身이 非汝有也어니 汝何得有爲道리오 舜이 曰 吾身이 非吾身면 孰有之哉리오 曰是-天地之委形也며 生非汝有라 是天地之委和也며 性命이 非汝有라 是天地之委順也-니 故로 行不知所住하며 處不知所持-며 食不知所以는 卽 天地-强陰陽也-니 又胡可得而有耶아』하엿도다. 말미어 列子는 自然物로써 自己의 有라 하는 者에 對하야 盜라 指目하엿다.

修身論(修爲의 目的은 絶對)
此는 自然과 人爲와를 對立케 한 妄見을 劈破하야 此를 모다 同一한 自然에 歸케 함이니 修身第一의 工夫는 我見을 去함에 在하다. 何者오 하면 彼我의 別이 無함으로써-라. 故로 曰 『信命者於彼 我無二心』이라 하고 『列子學事九年 橫心之所念 橫口之所言 亦不知我之是非利害歟 亦不知彼之是非利害歟 外內進矣而後 眼如耳 耳如鼻 鼻如口 無不同』이라 하엿스니 列子의 思想이라 할 바는 卽身絶對的이라. 此- 老子와 大同小異한 점이라. 老子도 亦自然에 一任함으로써 適當타 하엿스나 然이나 此는 人性의 善으로써 假定한 論이라. 故로 그의 敎議는 社會的이라 然한데 列子의 唱導한 바는 全혀 物理的自然에 放任코저함으로 社會的은 아니로다. 卽 自己一身을 絶對케 함에 在하니 此點에서 楊子와 異한바니라. 楊子는 自己一身을 快樂케하고저 하고 列子는 卽身絶對로써 理想한 者니라.
修爲의 工夫 此域에 到達함은 卽無心으로써 惟一의 工夫를 삼앗다. 何也오 曰 海上의 人이 漚鳥를 好하는 者- 有하야 每朝海上에 往하야 漚鳥를 從遊할새 漚鳥의 近至者- 其算이 無하더니 一日은 父命으로 此를 捕하랴고 海上에 往하엿던바 一羽의 漚鳥도 近至하는 者- 無하니라. 此卽捕할 意를 持한 故로 自然造物이 咸應함이니 意가 無하면 人과 物이 自然할 것 뿐이다. 此我가 無心悠然히 自然에＜30＞ 一任함은 自然의 法則에 逆함이 無함으로써라. 列子工夫의 要는 此에 不外하다. 그리고 列子曰 『可以生而生天福也 可以死而死天福也』라 하니 此로써 能히 그 根本 思想의 在한 바를 見하겟도다.

結論
要컨대 列子는 宇宙의 必然 進動을 假定하고 修身의 目的은 惟一心으로써 絶對 無我의 域에 至케한 者니 그의 定命說을 論함에 楊朱와 如함은 大히 注意할 만하니라. 列子後 數十年을 經하야 莊子가 出하며 老子의 矛盾的 觀念을 開展함으로써 大히 中華哲學의 光彩를 放하니라.

莊子(傳並書)
莊子는 宋의 蒙人이라. 孟子와 畧同時人이니 卽齊宣王, 梁惠王時人이라. 其節이 淸雅하야 時君의 寵하는 바를 受하야 就仕하기를 不屑히 여겻도다. 故로 其言에 曰 『我가 寧히 貧賤汚瀆의 中에 遊戱自快할저언뎡 國한 者의 覇絆을 受치 안켓다』하고 終乃 仕치 안하엿스나 其終한 바를 不知하니라. 莊子의 著書 32篇이 只今 遺傳하엿는데 李虎의 世에 至하야 莊子의 書로써 南華眞經이라 名하니라.

論理學
(1) 一切의 觀念은 規定을 豫想치 아니한 者- 無하니 規定이라 함은 或 一物을 特히 抽想한 者로써 我가 主體의 作用에 屬한 者라 此를 一層 具體的으로 適用할 時는 左의 4對法則을 出하나니
(1) 左右 (2) 論理 (3) 分辨 (4) 競爭 莊子는 此를 八德이라 名하엿나니 凡天下彼此의 觀念은 此中에 總攝할 만하니라
(2) 天下의 物이 苟히 規定된 時는 他의 否定과 矛盾的으로 互相 對立함으로써 同一의 規定 卽 物을 二方面으로부터 觀한다. 莊子는 朝三暮四의 理로써 此 觀念을 明케 하엿스니 曰 『狙公이 橡子를 狙에게 分하여 曰 朝三暮四하리라 한대 衆狙-皆努하거늘 狙公이 曰 然하면 朝四暮三하리라한 즉 衆狙-皆喜하더라 名實이 不偉하거늘 一은 喜하고 一은 怒함은 矛盾의 一方을 將하야 是라 함에 由한 者니라』
(3) 此 矛盾的 相對를 超越한 者를 道라 하니 道는 絶對 卽 無差別 平等이라 故로 四『彼是莫得其偶 謂之道』라 하니라.
(4) 莊子는 此 矛盾相對의 觀念을 夢에 應用하야써 一種의 人生觀을 成하니 曰 『昔者莊周의 夢에 스스로 蝴蹀이 되어 翔翔然自適하야 그 愉快의 狀態를 形言키 難한바 周-스스로 周된 事를 忘却하엿더니 俄然히 覺하매 卽 遽遽然히＜31＞ 周-러라. 然則 周의 夢에 蝴蝶이 有하엿는지 或은 蝴蹀의 夢에 周가 有하엿는지 『人生은 畢竟 一場春夢』이라하고 又 『覺과 夢은 互相 豫想하는 者-라 覺한 後에 비롯오 其夢됨을 知하나니 今則覺이라 云하는 者도 亦更히 夢이 아닌 줄을 豈知리오 말미어 死生은 相豫想하는 者-라. 今生時로써 覺이라 함은 生時에 對한 夜夢 等을 經驗함으로써니 卽 生時에 對한 死로써 大覺이라 云치 아니치 못하겟다』

修身論
修身의 目的은 絶對 定住함에 在하다. 詳言하면 爲先 絶對는 相對를 超越한 者임을 知하야 心意를 此域에 定住케 함에 在하니라. 心意를 그 域에 定住한 者를 曰 達人, 眞人或은 至人이라 하야 그 德이 弘大無量하다. 莊子는 明白히 心과 形과를 區別하니 曰 『德有所長 形有所忘 修身之目的 在於心意 不問其形之如何』라하다. 心意가 絶對의 域에 定住한 人은 그 行動이 亦是 無意識的卽自然으로 理法에 合하는 者-로다.

結論
莊子는 鵬大의 筆을 揮하야 逍遙一篇을 稿하니 主眼할 바는 卽 大觀의 二字에 在하다. 一方으로는 莊子의 學理를 可知하겟고 一方으로는 그 學風을 何할만 함으로 此에 論하야 結論을 換하노라.
凡喁喁然하야 雜處不一한 人類社會의 事는 皆是 比較相對의 域에 在하니 斥鶡이 枝에 遷하며 鳩鶩이 葉에 隱한 者 或은 數尺을 飛하고 或은 三尺을 翔하야 唶唶然相悅하고 惆惆然相悲하니 人類의 行動 云爲가 皆此 類와 同할 뿐이다. 然則 吾人은 맛당히 大鵬九萬里의 高에 上할지라 背에 靑霄를 上하고 行動 自在치 아님이 不可하니 所謂 『乘天地之正 而御六氣之辨 以遊無窮者』 卽 是-라. 此 即 絶對의 域으로써 毫末도 人寰에 對함과 如한 規定의 範圍에 陷치 아니할지로다

丁. 楊家
楊子(傳並書)
楊子의 名은 朱라. 其傳은 末詳하나 孟子-楊墨을 拒함으로써 畢世의 務함을 見하면 當時 楊子의 說이 天下에 遍滿하야 黨派를 成함을 知得할지로다. 딸아서 楊子의 年代는 孟子에 先하고 墨子에 稍後임이 明白하도다. 淮南子- 楊子를 討論하야 曰 全性保眞不以物累形楊子之所立也라 하니 故로 中華哲學史에 闕키 不可하노라.＜32＞

哲學
萬物定命論 凡 一切 現象은 自生自滅하는 者- 아니다. 換言하면 萬物의 生死存亡은 自己의 意思에 由하야 左右할 者-아니오, 皆 天地自然에 關係될뿐인 故로 曰 『賢愚貴賤 非所能也 臭腐消滅 亦非所能也 故生非所生 死非所死 賢非所賢 愚非所愚 貴非所貴 賤非所賤 然而萬物
齊生齊死 齊賢齊愚 齊貴齊賤 十年亦死 百年亦死』라 한다. 然한데 萬物은 그 生存하는 間에 단 彼此 서로 區別할 者- 아니오 그 死함에 至하얀 皆是 土壤에 歸함은 一이니라. 故로 曰 『生則堯舜 死則腐骨 生則桀紂 死則腐骨一矣』라하니 萬物은 差別로써 生存하고 亦自然한 一定의 運命이 有하니 此則 孟子에게서 問曰 『有人於此 貴生愛身 以靳不死可乎 曰現無不死 以靳久生可乎 現無久生 生非貴之所能存 且非愛之所能厚也』-라하니 是- 楊子의 萬物定命論이니라.
楊子는 萬物定命의 原因으로써 神에 歸치 아니하고 오즉 自然觀을 定함에서 不外하다. 然則 彼가 萬物定命의 根本思想으로부터 演繹하야 得한 者는 如何한가?
(1) 快樂主義. 人生은 朝露와 如하야 死는 皆 一般이라. 堯舜과 如한 聖도 死하면 卽 腐敗하고 桀紂와 如한 惡도 死하면 卽 腐敗하야 究竟 土壤을 成하나니 此卽 萬物의 定命으로부터 來한 一種의 厭世的 觀念에서 不外하니 此 觀念의 反動으로써 快樂主義가 出來하니라. 말미어 楊子는 徹頭徹尾히 厭世的이라. 其言에 曰 『世事苦樂 古猶今也 變易治亂 古猶今也 旣聞之矣 其見之矣 百年猶厭其多 况久生之苦也』리오 하니라.
(2) 自殺의 害. 萬物이 旣히 一定의 運命이 有하니 此 運命을 全하는 者는 吾人의 本務라. 楊子曰 『生則廢而任之 究其所欲 以俟於死 將死則廢而任之 究其所之 以放於盡 無不廢 無不任 何遽遲速乎其問乎』하니라.
(3) 肉體의 客觀. 萬物定命論의 結果로써 楊子는 又 그 肉體를 客觀으로 視한다. 故로 曰 『身非我有也』라 하엿스니 如斯히 肉體를 無視한 結果로써 畢竟 葬禮를 輕히 함에 至하다. 然하나 亦 一方으로는 人間의 競爭은 腕力이 아니오 반듯이 智力인 所以를 看破하엿슴으로 그 言에 云하되 『智之所貴 存我爲貴 力之所賤 侵物爲賤』이라 함과 共히 智力에 由하야 惟自我의 존재를 圖코저 하엿도다.

結論
楊子의 根本思想은 隱退主義(個人主義)-라. 然이나 그 說이 遂히 老子의 高遠에 及치 못하고 오즉 去名無憂(某라는 名을 不取)를 主張한 者니라. 直接으로 社會主義와는 衝突되어 卽 個人的 獨立主義를 唱하고 又 個人的 快樂主義를 主張한 者-니 是- 墨子와 正反對한 바로다.
