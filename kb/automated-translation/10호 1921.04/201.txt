Poetry Collection: Dance of Anguish (懊惱의 舞蹈)

Our literary scene is too quiet, and there are too few literary books in our society. Where does the cause of this lie? We can only say it is because the literary world still lacks vitality and promotional power. If there are people with passionate hearts and true sincerity, their earnest wish, above all else, would be for many literary books to be published in our script. In this regard, one piece of welcome news is the publication of the translated poetry collection, "Dance of Anguish" (懊惱의 舞臺 - *Note: The title appears as 懊惱의 舞蹈 in the heading and 懊惱의 舞臺 in the body text. Assuming 舞蹈 'Dance' is correct based on the heading and common knowledge about this work.*). The translator, Mr. Kim Ŏk (金億), has deep expertise in poetry. This collection gathers over 8,000 lines (*8000여 수 probably refers to 80-odd poems, not 8000 lines or poems*) of famous poems from Europe and America; the exquisite charm of his translation is sufficient to be true to the original poems, and the beautiful resonance of their rhythm seems capable of intoxicating the reader. Among these, the cover design by Mr. Kim Yubang (金維邦) can be called exceptionally brilliant. We recommend that anyone with an interest in literature read it at least once. The fixed price is One Won (壹圓), and the publisher is said to be Kwangik Sŏgwan (廣益書館). <137>

**Summary**

This article from the magazine *Kaebyŏk* (개벽) reviews the newly published translated poetry collection "Onoe ŭi Mudo" (懊惱의 舞蹈 - Dance of Anguish), translated by Kim Ŏk (金億) and designed by Kim Yubang (金維邦). The reviewer laments the scarcity of Korean literary works and praises this collection as a welcome addition, highlighting the translator's skill and the designer's artistry. It encourages those interested in literature to read the book, published by Kwangik Sŏgwan (廣益書館) for one Won. From a historical perspective, the article is significant as it reflects the nascent efforts to build a modern Korean literary tradition using the Korean script during the early Japanese colonial period. It underscores the cultural anxieties about the lack of native publications and celebrates the emergence of translated Western literature as a means to stimulate the domestic literary scene, revealing the intellectual climate and publishing activities of the time.
