**Summary**

This article introduces two newly published books in May 1925. The first, "Kim Kongjak ŭi Aesang," is highlighted as a pioneering collection composed entirely of writings by Korean women. The second, "Saengmyŏng ŭi Kwasil," is a collection of creative works (poetry, fiction, essays) by Kim Myŏngsun, described emphatically as Korea's sole female writer, reflecting her life and thoughts. Historians might find this article interesting as it documents the early efforts to publish works by Korean women during the colonial period, highlighting both the emergence of female authors like Kim Myŏngsun and the establishment of Korean publishing houses (Ch'ŏngjosa, Hansŏng Toso). The description of Kim Myŏngsun as the "only" female writer, while possibly an overstatement, underscores the perceived rarity and significance of female literary voices at the time.
