**Body Text Translation**
餘滴 (Yŏjŏk)

Cha Sangch'an, who was in the midst of a survey trip (踏査) in Hwanghae Province, recently returned to the company after going to his hometown residence (鄕第) due to experiencing the death of a parent (親喪). Pak Talch'ŏng, replacing Mr. Cha, then went on a business trip (出張), also to Hwanghae Province. Consequently, the editorial office (編輯室) temporarily felt undeniably lonely and quiet.

Meanwhile, because the nationwide Korean Reporters' Conference and Mass Movement Activists' Conference were being held consecutively, visits (尋訪) from guests from the provinces (地方) were quite frequent, and there was much related work, keeping the editors very busy (奔忙).

Due to these circumstances (事情), editing the May issue was truly difficult (困難). Accordingly, there is some dissatisfaction (不滿) with the content (內容), and the Hwanghae Province article (記事), which was scheduled (預定) for publication (發表) in this month's issue (本月號), unavoidably (不得已) had to be pushed back to June.

However, as they say, "truth hides in falsehood" (虛虛實實); Pujiam's "Intelligentsia" (일텔리켄치아), the long treatise (長論文) by Yi Minch'ang of Beijing (北京) titled "The Causes and Current State of Korea's Economic Ruin and Countermeasures" (朝鮮의 經濟破滅의 原因과 現狀 及 對策), and the other pieces in the Kaebyŏk Review Forum (開闢評壇) recorded (記載) in this month's issue are all worth reading for anyone.

Furthermore, the literary section (文藝篇) of over 80 pages—including Yi Sŏnghae's creative work (創作) "Baptism of Soil" (흙의 洗禮), P'albong's "Overview of the New Spring Literary Scene" (新春文壇 總觀), and the essay (隨筆) "On the Crossroads" (十字街 우에서)—can serve as a fine close friend (親友) on a spring night (春宵) where every moment is precious (一刻千金).

Finishing the editing and looking outside the window (窓 外), the apricot blossoms (杏花) are already half in bloom. Year after year, the flowers are similar (年年歲歲花相似), yet how are human affairs (人事) different between past and present (古今)? Recalling old friends at the ends of the earth (天涯故人), the sentiment (感慨) is also immeasurable (無量).<89>

**Summary**

This editor's postscript from the May 1925 issue of *Kaebyŏk* explains the difficulties faced during editing. Staff absences due to a bereavement (Cha Sangch'an) and a subsequent replacement trip (Pak Talch'ŏng) to Hwanghae Province left the office short-handed. This was compounded by the busyness surrounding the concurrent Korean Reporters' Conference and Mass Movement Activists' Conference, which brought many visitors and related tasks. Consequently, the editors express some dissatisfaction with the issue's content and announce the unavoidable delay of a planned article on Hwanghae Province until June. Despite these challenges, they highlight notable contributions, including articles on the intelligentsia, the Korean economy by Yi Minch'ang in Beijing, and a substantial literary section featuring Yi Sŏnghae and P'albong. The piece concludes with a poignant reflection on the contrast between the cyclical return of spring flowers and the changing nature of human affairs, expressing longing for distant friends.

From a historical perspective, the mention of the Korean Reporters' Conference and the Mass Movement Activists' Conference is significant, pointing to the active organization and networking among Korean intellectuals and activists during the colonial period, likely discussing national issues and strategies. The reference to Yi Minch'ang's article on "Korea's Economic Ruin" directly reflects contemporary concerns and critical analysis of the economic situation under Japanese rule. The editor's final melancholic reflection might subtly allude to the broader political constraints and personal separations experienced during that era, making it interesting for historians studying the intellectual and social climate of 1920s Korea.

餘滴
黃海道 踏査 中에 잇던 車相瓚君은 其間親喪을 當하고 鄕第에 갓섯다가 近頃에 歸社하고 朴達成君은 車君을 代하야 또 黃海道에 出張하고 보니 編輯室은 一時孤寂한 感이 不無하엿섯다.
然中全國的으로 떠드는 朝鮮記者大會와 民衆運動者大會가 繼續開催되는 까닭에 地方 손님의 尋訪이 퍽도 頻繁하고 거긔에 關聯되는 일도 만하서 編輯者도 매우 奔忙하엿섯다.
이러한 事情으로 말미암아 5月號의 編輯은 正말 困難하엿다. 따러서 內容도 不滿한 感이 업지 안코 또 本月號에 發表하기로 預定하엿던 黃海道 記事도 不得已 6月로 밀게 되엿다.
그러나 虛虛實實이라고 本月號에 記載된 不知菴君의 「일텔리켄치아」와 北京 李民昌君의 「朝鮮의 經濟破滅의 原因과 現狀 及 對策」이라는 長論文과 其他 開闢評壇 等은 누구나 一讀할 價値가 잇고
또 李星海君의 創作인 「흙의 洗禮」와 八峯君의 新春文壇 總觀과 「十字街 우에서」란 隨筆을 爲始한 80餘頁의 文藝篇은 一刻千金인 春宵에 好個親友가 될 만하다.
編輯을 맛치고 窓 外를 바라보니 杏花가 벌서 半이나 피여잇다. 年年歲歲花相似언만 人事는 어이 古今이 不同한가 天涯故人을 追憶하니 感慨가 또한 無量하다.＜89＞
