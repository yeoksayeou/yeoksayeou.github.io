Company Announcement

Mr. Kim Hyŏnggŭn (金亨根), reporter for the Kaesŏng Branch Office (開城支社), has resigned due to circumstances. We hereby respectfully announce this. Kaebyŏksa<68>

**Summary**

This short notice announces the resignation of Kim Hyŏnggŭn, a reporter for the Kaesŏng branch of the magazine *Kaebyŏk*. The reason cited is simply "circumstances." From a colonial history perspective, such announcements, while seemingly mundane, can be of interest. They document personnel changes within significant Korean cultural publications like *Kaebyŏk*, which operated under Japanese rule. The vague reason "circumstances" might sometimes mask underlying political pressures, economic difficulties, or internal disagreements faced by Korean intellectuals and organizations during this period, offering a small window into the operational challenges of maintaining a Korean voice.
