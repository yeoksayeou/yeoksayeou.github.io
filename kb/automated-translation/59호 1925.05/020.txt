Author: N/A
Article Type: 잡저 (Miscellaneous writing)

When looking at the recent affairs of Chosŏn since that time (一自以後 - likely referring to the March 1st Movement of 1919), it seems that the spring months of March and April have always become a season for gatherings and movements. Reaching this spring, that energy has become even more vigorous, and we have come to see the outbreak of popular movements everywhere, without exception, in both the provinces and the capital (Kyŏngsŏng). However, perhaps calling this wind and rain upon blooming flowers (피는 꼿에 風雨) or obstructing rocks in a swift current (급한 흐름에 激石), the crackdown (取締) by the police authorities (警務當局) regarding this becomes more high-pressured (高壓化) and dynamic (動化) day by day, making last year seem like ancient history. First, youth conferences in various regions were suppressed (禁遏), the essential parts (要部) of the resolution (決議文) from the All-Chosŏn Reporters' Conference (全朝鮮記者大會) were confiscated (押收), and the All-Chosŏn Popular Activists' Conference (全朝鮮民衆運動者大會) was forcibly banned (强禁) on the eve of its opening (開會前夜). However, what we think here is that in the natural world, we have neither seen nor heard an actual example where flowers that should bloom couldn't bloom because of wind and rain, or where water that should flow couldn't flow because of obstructing rocks (激石). Thinking about it, it seems unlikely we will see or hear such an example in the future either. Comrades (동무들아). <1>

**Summary**

This short piece from May 1925 reflects on the increasing surge of Korean popular movements (meetings, conferences) during the spring, comparing this burgeoning activism to flowers blooming. It contrasts this vitality with the intensifying crackdown by Japanese colonial police authorities, who banned youth conferences, confiscated parts of a reporters' resolution, and prohibited a major activists' conference. Despite this suppression, the author draws an analogy from nature, asserting that just as wind and rain cannot stop flowers from blooming or rocks stop water from flowing, these crackdowns will ultimately fail to halt the Korean people's movements. For historians, this article offers a contemporary snapshot of the tense atmosphere in colonial Korea during the mid-1920s, documenting specific instances of Japanese suppression (targeting youth, press, and activists) while capturing the persistent nationalist or activist spirit expressed through metaphors of natural resilience. The use of "동무들아" (Comrades) is also significant, potentially indicating the author's leftist or nationalist leanings.

花發多風雨
