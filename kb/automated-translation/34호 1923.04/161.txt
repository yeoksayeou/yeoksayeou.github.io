Setting: A room in the Elder's house.
The Elder's drawing-room, modeled as much as possible after Western style, is situated on a high terrace overlooking a port. At the far left of the stage, a door leads to the inner room. Next to it, against the wall, a single sofa(?). Next, a bookshelf. Next, in the center of the wall, a pair of glass doors leading to the veranda. The sea is visible through the glass doors. Next to the glass doors, a small table. On the table, a birdcage. Next, a single organ. Next, at the far right of the stage, a door leading to the entrance hall. Several chairs and tables(?) are scattered around the room, and images of ancient saints hang here and there on the walls. Time is noon in spring. Birdsong is occasionally heard from the birdcage. When the curtain rises, Ki-sun is playing the organ, Ki-ok is bustling about feeding the bird, and Ki-sŏk is sitting by the central fireplace(?), reading a book.

(Ki-sŏk) (After reading for a while, seemingly annoyed by the noise) Please stop making noise and be quiet. Whenever I try to study, you make such a fuss, how can I possibly study? (To himself) Playing the organ when she doesn't even know how, just making squeaking sounds... <89>
Does she think the bird is her ancestor... feeding it fifteen times a day.

(Ki-sun) (Laughing incredulously, simultaneously with Ki-ok) What? You can't study because I'm squeaking on the organ? ... A great scholar is born! ... How much studying do you think you do? ... And isn't studying music also studying? ... That sneaky kid, just because Father favors him, he thinks he's the only one in the world...

(Ki-ok) Oh, sister, don't say anything to him. If you say the slightest thing about him, he immediately tattles to Father. Just the other day, he said in front of Father, "Ki-sun and Ki-ok don't even say grace when they eat..." So Father believed his words and glared at me, only treating him nicely. So he thinks the world is his and acts recklessly...

(Ki-sŏk) Why do you two gang up on me and make my life miserable?

(Ki-sun) Who's making your life miserable?

(Ki-sŏk) The other day, when I said I wanted to grow up quickly and become a pastor, you yelled at me, saying, "What kind of pastor could someone like you be?"

(Ki-sun) Oh, always the pastor, that darn pastor! Do you even know what a pastor is before you blabber on?

(Ki-ok) Know anything? He knows absolutely nothing (밋은치를 알어요)! The other day, when someone said, "A certain pastor healed sickness through prayer," he immediately said in front of Father, "When I grow up and become a pastor, I'll pray to God and heal people's sicknesses too..." And Father, hearing his words, was pleased and nodded his head.

(Ki-sun) (Simultaneously with Ki-ok) Aha... That's how it is—insulting people. Being a boy is good, indeed.

(Ki-ok) What's so great about being a boy? Like Ki-byŏng oppa, running off to beg...

(Ki-sŏk) (In an angry voice) Is a girl some kind of high official then?

(Ki-sun) (Simultaneously with Ki-ok) That's why I'm asking what's so special about being a girl!

(Ki-sŏk) Then why did you insult boys? Why did you insult them?

(Ki-ok) Who insulted boys? <90>

(Ki-sŏk) Then why did you say boys go around begging? ... Do boys beg? ... There are even presidents who are boys! Is there any president who's a girl?

(Ki-ok) Girls wouldn't want to be president even if you offered it to them.

(Ki-sŏk) Hmph, I bet! Girls can't even become a single police officer (巡査)...

(Ki-ok) Is a police officer so great to you? If police officers are so great, then you can be all the police officers in the world yourself—go ahead.

(Ki-sŏk) I'm going to be a pastor! Who told you to become a police officer?

(Ki-ok) Oh, that darn pastor! What on earth is a pastor?

(Ki-sŏk) Pastors go to America (米國)... Are you guys going to America?

(Ki-ok) Why couldn't I go? Don't girls have feet and hands? Why couldn't I go using my own feet?

(Ki-sŏk) Father has to send you.

(Ki-ok) If Father says I can't go... If Father says I can't go, then why can't I go with my new husband later?

(Ki-sun) (Smiling)

(Ki-sŏk) Do you have a new husband?

(Ki-ok) Why wouldn't I have a new husband? Why wouldn't I?

(Ki-sun) Oh, I hate listening to this, stop it, both of you.

(Ki-sŏk) Even if you have a new husband, would he be the kind of new husband who can go to America?

(Ki-ok) Why wouldn't there be a new husband who can go to America? Do you think only you can go to America?

(Ki-sŏk) You'll probably just end up with a common police officer (巡査). <91>

(Ki-ok) (Flaring up) You rascal, why are you telling me I'll end up with a police officer?

(Ki-sŏk) Why would a pastor marry someone like you?

(Ki-ok) In your eyes, are pastors the only people? ... Like beggars, just following funerals...

(Ki-sŏk) How are they beggars? ... How is a pastor a beggar?

(Ki-ok) If not a beggar, what's so great about a pastor?

(Ki-sun) (Turns around and starts playing the organ again)

(Ki-sŏk) I'll ask Father when he comes home if pastors are beggars...

(Ki-ok) Do you think Father is the only person in the world?

(Ki-sŏk) Then you... Do you think a new husband is the only thing in the world?

(Ki-ok) Who said a new husband is the only thing?

(Ki-sŏk) Then why did you call pastors beggars?

(Ki-ok) If I called pastors beggars... what business is it of yours?

(Ki-sŏk) How is it not my business?

(Ki-ok) Do you think someone like you could ever even become a pastor?

(Ki-sŏk) Why couldn't I, you darn girl (게집애)?

(Ki-ok) If I'm a girl, do I ask you for rice? Do I ask you for porridge?

(Ki-sun) Oh, it's disgusting. Stop fighting.

(Ki-sŏk) Then why did you say I'd be begging?

(Ki-ok) You rascal, I said you'd be begging, did I say I would be begging? <92>

(Mother) (Enters holding a broom and cleaning rag) Goodness, why are you all making such a racket again? (Looking at Ki-ok) Why are you making such a fuss with the little one?

(Ki-ok) It's because that little beggar is making such a fuss.

(Ki-sŏk) I was trying to study, and you two were making a fuss. What did I say?

(Ki-sun) Who told you not to study?

(Mother) Stop it now, I hate hearing it. Father will be home soon. (Cleans the room)

(Ki-sŏk) I'm going to tell Father when he comes back.

(Ki-ok) Go ahead and tell him, who committed a crime?

(Ki-sŏk) Why did she tell me to just become a police officer?

(Ki-ok) Why did he say I'd end up with a police officer for a husband?

(Mother) Police officer this, auditor that, stop making noise. If you study, study. If you just sit there scratching, you only pick fights. People aren't valuable, how can one live like this?

(Ki-sŏk) Mother, Ki-ok says she'll go to America with her new husband.

(Mother) Ah, will you still not be quiet... (Ki-sun, Ki-sŏk chuckle and return to their original positions. Ki-ok, with an angry expression, opens the left door and enters the inner room) My goodness, how can children be like that? Like step-siblings... fighting day and night... Look at other children, are there any others like you...? (Father enters through the right door.)

(Mother) (Stopping her cleaning) Oh my, you've returned quite quickly.

(Father) I went because there was something to discuss for a moment, but unexpectedly, something unusual happened, so I came straight back.

(Mother) Is Elder Yi (李長老) well?

(Father) He is... <93>

(Ki-sŏk) Father, did you buy me a book?

(Father) I forgot. I'll definitely buy you one tomorrow.

(Ki-sŏk) Are you going out again tomorrow?

(Father) Yes, I'll make a special trip to buy it for you.

(Mother) Is everyone well at their house?

(Father) As I just said, something extremely unusual happened at their house, so I couldn't even discuss what I needed to and just came back...

(Mother) Oh, what happened at their house?

(Father) It's such an absurd and unprecedented event that I can hardly bring myself to speak of it.

(Mother) Oh, what unspeakable thing could have happened at such a household?

(Father) Uh... what was that child's name again... no, it's Elder Yi's eldest son I'm talking about.

(Mother) Yes, the one who graduated from Japan or somewhere last year and came back, right?

(Father) That's right! They say he was arrested by the Prosecutor's Bureau (檢査局) early yesterday morning.

(Mother) He was arrested? ... Why was that?

(Father) I don't know the details yet, but it seems he was discovered hiding explosives with the intent to blow up the church (敎堂).

(Mother) What did you say? ... Blow up the church with explosives? Why?

(Father) That's what I'm saying. It's become such a strange affair, there's really no way to describe it.

(Mother) Goodness gracious, what a terrifying thing to happen... What are they saying at their house?

(Father) It seems the truth somehow leaked out, because they already knew about it at their house... <94>

(Mother) Oh, how worried they must be...

(Father) They didn't seem particularly worried. Elder Yi even said it was a good thing for his son, asking, "What would have happened if he had actually carried it out? ... From now on, while he's living in prison, I hope he repents before God and becomes a righteous person again." He showed absolutely no sign of attachment or sorrow for his son, not even in his expression.

(Mother) Because his faith is strong... But there are indeed fearful things in this world.

(Father) Thinking about it one way, as Elder Yi said, it was rather fortunate. If he had really committed the act, his son's sin aside, what would happen to Elder Yi's honor (軆面) regarding the church?

(Mother) That's true. If it was bound to happen anyway, it was fortunate it ended there... But how could someone conceive of such an outrageous act?

(Father) The world is becoming like wind-tossed waves, order is collapsing, morality is fading away, distinctions between old and young, the duty between parents and children are set aside... even to the point where people intend to insult God (하나님), so what more can be said?

(Mother) Indeed, I don't know why, but these days people's hearts are changing daily, and whether adults or children, there's no sign of love for each other at all.

(Father) Surely, the day of Christ's judgment is not far off... (Sound of knocking on the right door)

(Mother) Come in. (Pastor enters and bows silently to everyone)

(Father) Oh, it's Mr. Kim... Come in, come in... Please, sit down over there...

(Pastor) Have you been well these past few days?

(Father) Our house is always the same...

(Mother) Where have you been all this time?

(Pastor) Oh no, I've just been around. <95>

(Father) It's been many days...

(Pastor) I had some duties to attend to at the church during that time.

(Father) Hmm, you're never quite idle.

(Pastor) No, that's right... By the way, how is Ki-suk doing?

(Father) ...

(Mother) Lately, she's been going out into the garden quite a bit, and her spirits seem a bit brighter than before, but the doctor still says not to let her go out...

(Father) That illness isn't one that heals so quickly.

(Mother) Still, compared to when she was hospitalized, she's become a completely different person.

(Pastor) Of course! Even when she was discharged, her illness had lessened.

(Mother) But her nerves are still so hypersensitive that I can never relax my guard.

(Pastor) For things like nervous breakdowns (神經衰弱), it's better to let her get some outside air little by little rather than keeping her cooped up inside the house.

(Father) ...

(Mother) I wonder...

(Pastor) By the way, uh... have you heard about Mr. Chŏnghŭi (正熙)? ... Uh, Elder Yi's son.

(Father) Hmm, I just came back from their house, and the incident is so bizarre, I don't know what to say...

(Pastor) Yes, indeed. I also heard about it and was thinking of going to see Elder Yi right away... but as you just said, the matter is so peculiar that I thought visiting to offer condolences might be awkward, so I haven't been able to visit yet.

(Father) Hmm, as I just said, I went to see Elder Yi because there was something to discuss—completely unaware that such a thing had happened, not even dreaming of it. When I arrived just now, I unexpectedly heard that outrageous news, and at first, I didn't know what to say to Elder Yi... But Elder Yi, being inherently strong in faith, showed no sign of hesitation <96> or reluctance because it involved his son. Instead, he spoke of feeling ashamed towards the church and expressed that for his son's future, it might be better for him to experience prison life to some extent. It was truly the attitude of a believer, one cannot deny it...

(Pastor) Ha... truly, I have always had much to admire about that elder, but this is truly admirable beyond words.

(Mother) It's the strength of God.

(Pastor) By the way, the incident is being kept strictly confidential and hasn't even been reported in the newspapers, so the details aren't known. However, they say about eight accomplices were subsequently arrested, and the base of operations wasn't within Korea proper. Apparently, they imported and hid nearly several hundred explosives.

(Mother) And were those all confiscated? Also, the people arrested, did they all intend to use those explosives for the same purpose?

(Pastor) Of course, they were confiscated. And yes, those people were apparently secretly active with the aim of destroying all the church buildings (敎會堂) in Korea.

(Mother) Oh my, how could those people think like that? ... And did they think they wouldn't be punished by God for doing so?

(Father) If they were people who thought of God, how could such a thing happen?

(Pastor) What's even stranger is that most of those young men grew up in believers' homes. That's what's unusual.

(Mother) Most of them? ... What could be the reason for that?

(Pastor) Well, I don't know what the calculation is.

(Father) Just as Judas sold Jesus, this world is one where people will destroy themselves with their own hands... (Rings a bell to order tea)

(Ki-sŏk) Sir, pastors don't do things like that, do they? <97>

(Pastor) Pastors? Do pastors do such bad things? ... Why do you ask such a thing?

(Ki-sŏk) Because when I grow up, I'm going to study hard and become a pastor.

(Pastor) Ha... Right! You will study hard and become a good pastor, and teach those wicked people well so they don't become sinners before God, won't you?

(Ki-sŏk) Yes!

(Mother) A child who wants to be a pastor shouldn't fight with his siblings.

(Ki-sŏk) But Ki-ok told me to just become a police officer.

(Father) (Smiling) Why did Ki-ok tell you to just follow police officers around?

(Everyone) Ha...

(Father) Why was that?

(Mother) No, it wasn't that. They were bickering amongst themselves, saying "You become a police officer," "You'll get a police officer husband," "I'll become a pastor," "Pastors are like beggars," and making a fuss for a while.

(Father) If Ki-ok tells you again that a pastor is like a beggar, you tell Ki-ok she's like the Devil... (Servant brings tea)

(Pastor) Changing the subject, but regarding Ki-suk. If her mind is still not completely clear, perhaps you could take her to Pastor Kim Chu-sŏng (金疇聖牧師) and have her receive some prayer healing.

(Father) ...

(Mother) It would be somewhat better if we could take her somewhere like that, but how can we when she won't listen?

(Pastor) Why doesn't she listen to you?

(Mother) (Looking at the Elder's face) If you even mention the church, she runs ten miles away. <98>

(Pastor) You need to explain it so she understands...

(Mother) Don't I try to explain? No matter how much I explain, she doesn't listen... And her nerves are hypersensitive... so I can't scold her too harshly either.

(Pastor) Nevertheless, nervous illnesses need to be treated as quickly as possible. If it drags on for a long time, it becomes very difficult to cure.

(Father) (With a displeased expression) Illness is illness, but besides that, we have a sickness called 'love sickness' (愛病) in this house.

(Everyone) (Silence)

(Father) Even if the illness can be cured, there's no medicine to cure the other sickness...

(Pastor) That's not true. Just because parents understand their children doesn't mean they can't guide them onto the right path...

(Mother) You always just say the children aren't like you... How can everything in the world easily match your mind and will perfectly? Even the arms and legs attached to one body have a left and a right side... How can young children, just entering their teens, easily match the ways of an old man over fifty in everything?

(Father) Right~ You know it all yourself.

(Mother) Isn't it true? Since we're gathered like this today, let me say this. Have you ever once tried to understand (헤레보신일이게세요) the children? Though I've never said it my whole life, even when the children pray, you say it doesn't meet your expectations. How can they know the psychology of an old man your age exactly like that?

(Father) Children! Always children! Children at twenty, children at thirty, children just stay children day and night and never seem to learn how to be adults.

(Mother) To parents, they are children until they die... That's what I mean. I'm saying this because I've tried and tried, and I'm so frustrated. <99>

(Father) It's a stubborn disease. If anything happens (하면), it's the children; even if they turn the house upside down, it's the children; even if they plot rebellion, it's the children; even if they insult God, it's the children! That constant refrain of 'it's the children' is the incurable disease!

(Mother) Oh, please stop. It's the same argument day in and day out.

(Father) I absolutely do not mean we shouldn't understand (헤리지말나는) the children. But I cannot just cover everything up and say 'it's the children.'

(Mother) ...

(Father) Of course, there will be times when understanding is needed, but what good does it do to constantly coddle (밧치고) and shield them, calling them children? ... That fellow Ki-byŏng, did he turn out like that because he wasn't understood? ... That boy whom we constantly pampered (어러만지고), stroked (쓰다듬고), and coddled (밧치고)... for what reason did he kick aside his own father and run away? Was that all? Was that the only thing he did after leaving? Didn't he disrupt the discipline of the house, insult the holy God, and furthermore, abandon his aging mother and father and run away? ... And now, who knows where he's begging or if he's died destitute (斃死) on the roadside...

(Mother) (Wipes tears with the hem of her skirt)

(Pastor) Please stop. There's a sick person inside.

(Father) And speaking of which, where did that sick person come from? Thanks to whom (누구으네) did she contract such an illness? Was Ki-suk born with such an illness? Whose fault is it that the family is in turmoil (물릇하고) and ashamed (붓그려워) to show its face (낫츨) in society? It's also because the children weren't loved properly! That boy we constantly coddled and pampered, as payment for raising him and pampering him, left behind such a reward and ran away, didn't he? And still, the love is insufficient.

(Mother) Oh, I don't know. Was it because of too much love, or what? Who knows?

(Everyone silent)

(Father) (Rising from his chair) Forget about curing the children's illness for a moment, and first cure this sickness of reckless pampering love (사랑病)! (Father exits through the left door) <100>

(Mother) (After a long silence) I wonder what will become of this family. Not a single day of peace... Even the children just fight whenever they gather... One lying sick like that...

(Pastor) Father has also become especially hypersensitive since Ki-byŏng left home, and when he gets slightly agitated, he can't control himself like that.

(Mother) (Wiping tears) Wouldn't it be better if he just stopped now and came back? Who knows where he's begging... or if he's already dead... We haven't heard any news at all...

(Pastor) He'll come back... But traveling widely and seeing the world can also be a good thing... (Ki-suk's song from offstage)
Will you go down the mountain?
Will you go to the sea?
Leaving the nest, wandering far,
Blind dove.
Your father is on the back hill,
Your friends on the front hill,
Where will you go?
Blind dove...

(Pastor) (Looking at Ki-sun) Is that Ki-suk?

(Ki-sun) Yes. (As Ki-suk sings, she enters the stage through the left door and sees the Pastor)

(Ki-suk) Oh, Pastor Kim... you came already? (Sits down in a chair)

(Pastor) Yes, I arrived quite a while ago.

(Ki-suk) Did you hear many interesting stories while you were away? <101>

(Pastor) Yes, many. I also have a story that will greatly surprise (큼 놀내게할) Ki-suk.

(Ki-suk) A story that will greatly surprise me? ... Oh, wonderful! Please tell me quickly.

(Mother) You should have changed your clothes and fixed your hair before coming out. You came straight from the bedroom as you were.

(Ki-suk) Please tell the story quickly, I want to hear it. (Ki-ok enters)

(Pastor) Please wait. I'll tell you in order...

(Ki-ok) (Bowing to the Pastor) Welcome, Sir.

(Pastor) Oh, are you coming out to hear the story too? (Ki-ok goes over to the organ with the other children and sits down)

(Ki-suk) Did God have a funeral somewhere?

(Mother) Oh my, such words... (Looks worriedly towards the left door)

(Pastor) That's absolutely not true.

(Ki-suk) Then what is the story that will greatly surprise me?

(Pastor) In a certain region, an old man over seventy years old passed away as if falling asleep, but three days after the old man died, he came back to life.

(Mother) I think I saw something like that in the newspaper once.

(Pastor) It's true. This happened in the Ch'ŏngju (淸州) region. The old man said he received God's command and came back to life to teach the people of this world about Heaven (天國). Since the old man was originally a believer with strong faith, not only the believers in that region but even non-believers want to meet the old man at least once. We received word at our church that they don't know how many people seek out the old man each day.

(Mother) Oh my, who would think such a thing could actually happen in this world?

(Ki-suk) Is that unfortunate old man still alive?

(Pastor) Of course, he is alive. And that old man is definitely not unfortunate. For a person of this sinful world to see Heaven <102> and return, what great glory could there be? Such an old man must have come having prepared the place he will surely go.

(Ki-suk) Is coming back to life in this world such a glorious thing? Living past seventy... what more is lacking? ... Oh, what a dreadful thing.

(Pastor) Ha... I knew Ki-suk would surely have such thoughts upon hearing this story... Not just Ki-suk, who would be content living in a world fallen into such sin? However, what I call glorious now is, for a person of this world to see Heaven and return, how wondrous and glorious must that not be?

(Ki-suk) Yes, was that the story? The story you said would startle (적 놀라게하신다는) me...

(Pastor) Ha... That story is separate.

(Ki-suk) Please tell that story quickly... Sir.

(Mother) Hey Ki-suk, I'll tell that story instead of Pastor Kim... You know Elder Yi (李長老)... Mr. Yi Unyŏng. His son was arrested and taken to the Prosecutor's Bureau early yesterday morning.

(Ki-suk) Yes...

(Pastor) It's not that Hŭijŏng-gun being arrested is surprising, but the facts of his arrest are astounding (긔맥히니).

(Mother) That child is just barely over twenty, isn't he... Such a young thing... Goodness, it's truly dreadful (즉해) to even speak of.

(Pastor) That person was caught in a audacious conspiracy to destroy the chapel (禮拜堂) with explosives.

(Ki-suk) The chapel? So, was the chapel destroyed according to their plan?

(Pastor) How could that possibly happen? Is it not a holy sanctuary (聖堂) where God is revered? If that holy sanctuary could be destroyed so easily, what would become of things? It was merely that those who fell into temptation harbored a delusion.

(Ki-suk) Merely those who fell into temptation... harbored a delusion... (Nervously) Then those people... couldn't even test the explosives once... and were all arrested? <103>

(Pastor) That's right. They say all the dissidents involved in plotting that affair were arrested without a single one remaining.

(Ki-suk) (As if thinking of something)... Without a single one remaining... Before they could even test it once...

(Mother) Ki-suk, don't think about it too much... It's not good for your illness.

(Ki-suk) Mother, last night in my dream, I saw my brother who left.

(Mother) You saw Ki-byŏng?

(Ki-suk) Oppa was wearing strange clothes and painting on a canvas as large as a door... The painting was of a beautiful woman, completely naked (거니벗고)... holding a sharp knife in her right hand, cutting open her own chest, and with her left hand, pulling out her own heart, dripping with crimson (십건) blood, while smiling faintly... Oppa was carrying that painting on his back, walking down the main street, wanting to show it to people. At that time, everyone who saw the painting... called oppa crazy and also called him a traitor (返逆者), picking up stones and clubs to beat him... Seeing that, I screamed until my throat felt like it would burst... Oh, oppa... (Stands up from the chair, pointing at something as if delirious)...

(Mother) Ki-suk! Look here, Ki-suk! Hey, get a hold of yourself, Ki-suk!

(Ki-suk) ...

(Mother) Pull yourself together and sit here quietly... (Ki-suk sits down again)

(Pastor) Her nerves are still quite something.

(Mother) Something is making me sick with worry... If she gets even slightly agitated, she becomes like this.

(Pastor) She was naturally nervous, then influenced by Ki-byŏng, and on top of that, contracted that terrible fever... As time passes, she should naturally recover to her original state.

(Mother) Well, who knows when she'll become completely well... As things are now, I can't tell.

(Ki-suk) Pastor Kim. You always said you loved me, didn't you? <104>

(Pastor) Yes. Not just in words, but in fact, there isn't a time when I don't think of Ki-suk.

(Ki-suk) Thank you... Thank you. However, while your loving me is your freedom, please, absolutely do not love me the way my father loves me... Do not try to put me inside your heart. Do not try to make me exactly like you.

(Pastor) Ki-suk, look here. I am someone who tries to respect free will, at least somewhat. I am absolutely not someone who intends to disregard a person's individuality.

(Ki-suk) Yes, thank you. Thank you. But what did you always tell me to do? Didn't you ask me to pray before the holy God with a heart exactly like yours?

(Pastor) But Ki-suk, that absolutely does not mean restricting a person's free will. It merely stems from seeking happiness for both of us with one mind before the omniscient and omnipotent God.

(Ki-suk) Then you must have found satisfaction according to your will... you must have found happiness... But did you think that I, too, would find happiness like you?

(Pastor) Of course, I thought so.

(Ki-suk) Of course, like that... Of course, like that... Why did you think so? ... That I, too, of course, would have the same intention as you? ... Did you think so? ... No. That's not right. That thought is mistaken. No, that is an excessively cruel thought.

(Pastor) A cruel thought...

(Ki-suk) Of course, it is. Trying to make another person into oneself for the sake of one's own satisfaction is excessively cruel. It is a horrific thing.

(Pastor) That's not it, Ki-suk...

(Ki-suk) But I was a weak-hearted maiden. When I joined hands with you like that and prayed towards the heavens... <105> no, when I just mumbled something towards the empty void, merely following your command, my chest felt like it would burst, and my back felt chilled as if lashed by a whip, yet still, I tried hard not to show such signs before you.

(Pastor) ...

(Ki-suk) Was that the true intention of respecting free will? ... Can that be called a thought that is not cruel in the slightest?

(Pastor) Ki-suk, I absolutely never commanded Ki-suk to do anything.

(Ki-suk) I prayed once before God. It was the first prayer I offered since coming into this world... And it was the last prayer I offered... Just once... truly according to my will... I prayed... asking to be sent back from this world to my homeland... But God did not answer. God kept me confined in this world, just as my father watches the Gouldian finch in that birdcage... watching me suffer and weep in agony as my heart burns...

(Mother) Ki-suk! Don't let your heart be so weak. And try to compose yourself... Think about calming down.

(Ki-suk) But I had to constantly bow my head before such a God and pray words I didn't mean... because my father's eyes were frightening... When he glared at me with those thorny eyes, it felt as if an arrow pierced my chest, and my whole body shivered as if cold water were splashed on me, my heart trembled.

(Mother) Ki-suk, you must stop now, Ki-suk.

(Ki-suk) Those dreadful eyes of my father stripped away everything from my entire being, leaving only the physical body called Ki-suk, nothing else... And thus, the scarecrow named Ki-suk came to be married to someone like you.

(Pastor) Ki-suk! (In a firm voice) Those who betray God cannot find salvation for their souls (靈魂). <106>

(Ki-suk) ... Soul, you say? ... My soul has already promised to return to my homeland.

(Pastor) Ki-suk! Get a hold of yourself.

(Mother) Ki-suk!

(Ki-suk) I am not crazy. Now, I am definitely not the weak woman who would fall prey to your threats as before. I have reclaimed everything that I had lost to you until now. I can now see everything with my own eyes. I can hear with my own ears. And with my restored mind, there is nothing I cannot judge. (Stands up from the chair, pointing at something) Can't you see over there? ... That is my homeland. My home, where I was buried like a corpse (듯이뭇쳐잇든), is over there... There, nothing but the sound of happy laughter can be heard.

(Pastor) Take her to the bedroom.

(Mother) (Embracing Ki-suk) Ki-suk, let's go inside together... Let's go over there and calm down a bit.

(Ki-suk) (Nervously) Nobody touch (닷치지마러요) my body. Don't persecute (핍박하지마러요) me.

(Mother) Ki-suk, pull yourself together and look at me... Don't you recognize me, Ki-suk? (Pastor takes hold of Ki-suk and goes with Mother through the left door)

(Ki-suk) Evil is what you created. You make prisons with your own hands and punish yourselves there... (The three exit)

(Ki-ok) (After the three children sit in silence for a while) Is sister crazy?

(Ki-sun) Who knows? Just sit quietly.

(Ki-sŏk) She went crazy after getting scolded by Father.

(Ki-sun) If you don't know, just be quiet.

(Ki-sŏk) I don't get scolded by Father. <107>

(Ki-sun) Right~ Oh, just stop it. (A ship's whistle sounds from a steamship)

(Ki-sŏk) (Listening for a moment) A steamship must have arrived- (The three children run to the window and look out at the sea)... Wow, look at that! It's a steam whistle...

(Ki-ok) Oh my, it's huge...

(Ki-sun) It wasn't there before, where did it come from so quickly?

(Ki-sŏk) That's an American steamship.

(Ki-ok) What did it come here for?

(Ki-sŏk) It came for sightseeing.

(Ki-sun) How do you know if it came for sightseeing or something else?

(Ki-sŏk) That steamship is packed full of pastors.

(Ki-ok) Heh, what a funny kid.

(Ki-sŏk) When I become a pastor, I'll ride a steamship like that and go to America.

(Ki-sun) I hate hearing it, please stop making noise.

(Ki-ok) Oh my, so many people are getting off. Sister, why are so many people getting off like that?

(Ki-sun) Who knows why they're getting off?

(Ki-sŏk) Look at that American person! Over there. Look at him holding a child closely, walking briskly with his wife.

(Ki-ok) There aren't many people wearing Korean clothes.

(Ki-sŏk) Since only pastors are on board, why would they wear Korean clothes?

(Ki-sun) Do only pastors wear Korean clothes?

(Ki-sŏk) They say they're getting off like that to give a lecture at the church hall tonight.

(Ki-sun) Ridiculous! This kid is really crazy. <108>

(Ki-sŏk) Look at that! They're unloading luggage now and loading it onto carts.

(Ki-ok) Oh my, what is all that?

(Ki-sŏk) That looks like cannons (大砲).

(Ki-ok) Cannons? What cannons?

(Ki-sŏk) They say they're going to shoot all the people who don't believe in Jesus dead with those cannons now.

(Ki-sun) Oh my, stop with those cannons. Please.

(Ki-ok) Oh my, look at that water coming out of the steamship!

(Ki-sŏk) Look there, look there! They're fighting!

(Ki-sun) Why are they making such a fuss...?

(Ki-ok) Oh my! Really...

(Ki-sŏk) Look at that! He's running away fast.

(Ki-sun) Oh my! Look at those people...

(Ki-sŏk) Maybe they're catching a thief (도적놈).

(The three) (Watch for a while...)

(Ki-sun) (Goes to the organ and sits down) Come over here... Stop watching now...

(Ki-sŏk) I don't know where he ran off to.

(Ki-sun) Father will scold us if he comes. Come here quickly. (The two children go towards Ki-sun)

(Ki-ok) Sister, why would they fight like that?

(Ki-sun) Oh, who knows? Let's stop and practice hymns... (Opens a hymnal)

(Ki-sŏk) They fight because they're bad people...

(Ki-sun) My Lord, As Thou Wilt... Number 217. <109>

(Ki-ok) Number 217! It's difficult for me.

(Ki-sun) That's why we practice difficult ones... Even Ki-sŏk can do it all, Ki-sŏk?

(Ki-sŏk) Nothing is difficult for me.

(Ki-sun) (Pressing the organ keys) Okay, all together, one, two, three. (The three sing a hymn together)
1. My Lord, as Thou wilt,
Do Thou act.
I offer all to the Lord.
This world's joys and sorrows,
Lord, guide me,
Govern me,
Let Thy will be done.
2. My Lord, as Thou wilt,
Do Thou act... (Sound of knocking on the right door. The children stop singing and look at the door)

(Ki-sun) Who is it?

(Ki-ok) (Opens the door)... Oppa!

(Ki-byŏng) (Enters wearing torn clothes) Oh, have you all been well?

(Ki-sun) Oppa, when did you arrive?

(Ki-byŏng) I just arrived now...

(Ki-sun) Did you come on that steamship?

(Ki-byŏng) Mm... Where has everyone gone? <110>

(Ki-sun) They're inside.

(Ki-byŏng) In the inner room? Sister too?

(Ki-sun) Yes. Shall I call them out?

(Ki-byŏng) No... Are they well?

(Ki-sun) Only sister got sick while you were away.

(Ki-byŏng) Ki-suk did? ... With what illness?

(Ki-sun) They call it a fever (熱病). It hasn't been long since she was discharged from the hospital.

(Ki-byŏng) Fever? ... Is she completely recovered now?

(Ki-sun) She's not as seriously ill as when she was in the hospital.

(Ki-byŏng) Then is she still lying in bed?

(Ki-sun) No, she does get up and walk around the house.

(Ki-byŏng) Then...

(Ki-sun) Even though she's not bedridden...

(Ki-byŏng) Even though she's not bedridden, she's not completely well?

(Ki-sun) No... She's just not like she used to be.

(Ki-byŏng) Hmmm. How so?

(Ki-sun) Her words are always strange...

(Ki-byŏng) What kind of strange things does she say?

(Ki-sun) Just... not a single word is understandable... Just a little while ago, she was acting so, so strangely that they took her into the bedroom.

(Ki-sŏk) She went crazy after getting scolded by Father... <111>

(Ki-byŏng) Went crazy after getting scolded by Father... Hahaha—how much scolding did she get to go crazy?

(Ki-ok) Oh, that's nonsense.

(Ki-byŏng) It's nonsense? ... Then does the future Pastor-nim also tell such lies?

(Ki-sŏk) She gets scolded because she doesn't listen to Father's words.

(Ki-byŏng) What on earth are they doing inside?

(Ki-sun) Who knows what they're doing? ... About thirty minutes ago, Mother and Father argued. After Father went inside angrily, sister started making a scene again, so Mother and Pastor Kim took sister into the bedroom.

(Ki-byŏng) Who is Pastor Kim?

(Ki-sun) He's inside. Kim Ŭng-du (金應斗)...

(Ki-byŏng) Hmph, that little kid is already acting like a Pastor-nim? ... That Pastor-nim is Father's chosen son-in-law. (Ki-suk's song is heard from offstage)
Will you go down the mountain?
Will you go to the sea?
Leaving the nest, wandering far,
Blind dove...

(Ki-byŏng) Is that Ki-suk singing that song?

(Ki-sun) Yes. These days, she only sings that song every day. <112> Blind dove... (Ki-suk enters slowly, her hair undone)

(Ki-byŏng) (With a pleased expression) Ki-suk!

(Ki-suk) (Looking faint) Oppa!

(Ki-byŏng) (Embracing Ki-suk) What is this state you're in? You really have gone crazy.

(Ki-suk) Oppa... how did you come?

(Ki-byŏng) I came on that steamship.

(Ki-sŏk) Hyŏngnim came on that American steamship.

(Ki-suk) Why did you come?

(Ki-byŏng) Why did I come? ... I didn't come specifically because of matters at this house.

(Ki-suk) When are you leaving?

(Ki-byŏng) When am I leaving! Well, I don't know for sure... But I won't stay long in this house.

(Ki-suk) When does that steamship leave?

(Ki-byŏng) It'll probably leave soon.

(Ki-suk) When you leave, will you also take that steamship, oppa?

(Ki-byŏng) That I don't know either, what might happen...

(Ki-suk) Aren't you going to see Mother?

(Ki-byŏng) ...

(Ki-sŏk) If Father finds out, you'll get scolded...

(Ki-sun) Why can't you just be quiet?

(Ki-byŏng) Even if I were to see them, I didn't come for any particular reason... By the way, you were very sick during my absence? <113>

(Ki-suk) Yes. I was sick.

(Ki-byŏng) But you're still not completely recovered...

(Ki-suk) No, the illness is already all gone.

(Ki-byŏng) Still, hearing what Ki-sun just said... you're not quite like your old self...

(Ki-suk) Oppa! Those scarecrows say I'm crazy.

(Ki-byŏng) Who are the scarecrows?

(Ki-suk) The scarecrows? ... They are the people who call me crazy.

(Ki-byŏng) You've been fighting again.

(Ki-suk) Oppa! Are you still painting?

(Ki-byŏng) Painting? Who spends their life painting things like that?

(Ki-sŏk) Father says painters are the worst kind of people in the world.

(Ki-byŏng) Father is still striving to make you a model pastor for the Christian church...

(Ki-suk) Dreams are indeed lies.

(Ki-byŏng) Did you have a dream?

(Ki-suk) Yes, in my dream, I saw you painting, oppa.

(Ki-byŏng) In this house, you're probably the only one who would think of me even in a dream.

(Ki-suk) Then oppa, what are you doing now?

(Ki-byŏng) Me? ... I'm not doing anything.

(Ki-suk) Ab-solutely nothing?

(Ki-byŏng) But there was just one thing I was making. <114>

(Ki-suk) What was that?

(Ki-byŏng) That was... a powerful explosive bomb (爆發彈).

(Ki-suk) Explosive bomb! ... What are you doing with that?

(Ki-byŏng) That... That was intended for use in destroying the slaughterhouse of our reason.

(Ki-suk) Oppa! (Nervously) Then oppa, are you going to... that church building?

(Ki-byŏng) Shhh... Don't make noise... I came to this house just to see you briefly before I go... To see you for a moment and bid you farewell once again.

(Ki-suk) And then... And then where will you go, oppa?

(Ki-byŏng) And the place I will go... The place I must go from now on, there is nowhere... Only... Only... that dark prison cell (監房) awaits me.

(Ki-suk) Eh! To prison? ... Oppa, into that dark prison cell?

(Ki-byŏng) I came here seeking the true self, intending to destroy that church building—no, the slaughterhouse of our reason—which crushes the reason of countless people... But... But... all plans have turned to bubbles (水泡).

(Ki-suk) (Showing an agitated attitude) Oppa!

(Ki-byŏng) By the time I arrived at this pier, my comrades had already been captured by the hand of the law... I learned this from my remaining comrade disguised as a laborer on the pier... When he met me, he took out a black handkerchief from his body and waved it left and right... That was the signal that all plans had collapsed. When I saw that, oh, my whole body felt like it was breaking apart, and my future seemed bleak, unable to take even a single step forward... To hide my feelings, I barely gathered my wits and moved myself onto this pier, but the search party had already surrounded us. <115>

(Ki-suk) Oppa! (Looking around cautiously)

(Ki-byŏng) (Takes a pistol from his pocket and places it on the table) I believed this was my life and somehow escaped that encirclement.

(Ki-suk) Oppa, then quickly hide somewhere.

(Ki-byŏng) Don't make noise. After escaping the encirclement, I looked everywhere but had nowhere to go. But I tried with all my might to hide myself.

(Ki-suk) Oppa! Then quickly hide yourself.

(Ki-byŏng) No. I definitely did not come here because I had nowhere to hide. Only... I came just to see you again and bid farewell once more.

(Ki-suk) Then... And then where are you going, oppa?

(Ki-byŏng) I... have no choice but to go to that dark prison cell like my comrades.

(Ki-suk) Then are you thinking of turning yourself in, oppa?

(Ki-byŏng) Of course! I absolutely do not intend to run away for the sake of my own safety, leaving my comrades in that dark place... However, before I go there, they will come to arrest me.

(Ki-suk) Oppa! (In a strong voice) Then when will the slaughterhouse of our reason ever be destroyed?

(Ki-byŏng) The comrades who still remain are spread throughout the world...

(Ki-suk) Then oppa... For that time, I swear by my abused body! (Picks up the pistol lying on the table and commits suicide)

(Ki-byŏng) Ki-suk! (Ki-byŏng snatches the pistol; the children scream; Father, Mother, Pastor, male and female servants enter from the left door)

(Mother) (Clutching Ki-suk's body) Ki-suk, what is this? (The stage is momentarily chaotic) <116>

(Pastor) (Shocked to see Ki-byŏng) Oh, aren't you Ki-byŏng?

(Father) (Stares at the body for a long time, then sits down in a chair as if fainting) Who is that person standing there?

(Pastor) Get a hold of yourself. That person is Ki-byŏng.

(Mother) Ki-suk, oh Ki-suk!

(Father) Ki-byŏng... Ki-byŏng... Who is Ki-byŏng?

(Pastor) Your son Ki-byŏng has returned.

(Mother) Oh, my Ki-suk!

(Pastor) (Seeing the pistol in Ki-byŏng's hand) What is that in your hand?

(Ki-byŏng) (Places it on the table) It's a pistol...

(Pastor) Pistol... Pistol... Then did you kill your sister Ki-suk with the pistol?

(Ki-byŏng) (With a calm demeanor) Whether someone killed her or not, isn't it the same that one person is dead?

(Pastor) That's outrageous talk... You've just killed someone, yet you show no fear?

(Ki-byŏng) Don't make so much noise... There will be another woman to be your wife in this world.

(Pastor) Outrageous talk... You utterly disregard humanity, disregard morality, disregard the law...

(Ki-byŏng) Look here, Mr. Kim. Right now, isn't it just that one person has died? If you have words of instruction for me, how about we arrange another time in the future?

(Pastor) Don't misunderstand my words. I absolutely have no intention of instructing you or anything. But aren't you the sinner who killed your sister? ... How do you intend to atone for that sin?

(Ki-byŏng) If I have committed a sin, I intend to atone for the sin with the sin itself...

(Pastor) Ah, you are not human... If you are not a devil (惡魔) wearing the skin (기) of a person, how can you not know that God exists?

(Ki-byŏng) The God who understands me is within me... Look here, Mr. Kim. Haven't you deceived the reason of so many people by fabricating the legend called God, and still not found satisfaction?

(Pastor) Ah, you are a devil... A devil... You have not only killed your sister but are undeniably a devil who tries to disregard God! <117> Your sin will surely be punished by God... Oh, Father who art in Heaven, Father, for the sake of your pitiful children, please chase the wolf (狼) from among the flock of sheep...

(Father) Who is that person speaking over there?

(Pastor) That person is the sinner who killed Ki-suk. And also a devil who disregards God.

(Father) Devil! Devil... (As if to himself)

(Ki-byŏng) Look here, Mr. Kim. I don't have time to speak at length (댱황히) with you. But the one thing I ask of you now is, do not think that God can only be sought in Heaven...

(Pastor) Do not speak foolishly. How can you not know that God is omnipresent (無所不在)?

(Ki-byŏng) Right words. God is omnipresent... Omnipresent...

(Mother) Ki-suk! Pull yourself together! No one is persecuting you... And there is no one to glare (흘겨볼) at you with thorny eyes... (Three detectives burst in through the right door, compare Ki-byŏng's face with a description sheet (容貌記) they hold, and apprehend him)

(Ki-byŏng) I am definitely not someone who would flee.

(Pastor) That person is the sinner who killed his own sister with a pistol...

(Ki-byŏng) Go ahead, tie me up. (One detective binds Ki-byŏng while another examines Ki-suk's body)

(Mother) Oh, nobody persecute my daughter ()!

(Ki-byŏng) Then, everyone, let us promise to destroy the slaughterhouse of reason with our own hands and seek the true God within ourselves...
(Detectives hurry Ki-byŏng out through the right door)

(Father) Who is that person going out that door just now?

(Pastor) Get a hold of yourself. That person is the sinner who killed Ki-suk. And a devil who disregards God.

(Father) Devil... Devil...

(Mother) Ki-suk! Pull yourself together. And let's go to our homeland together...

(Ki-sŏk) (Walks towards the front of the stage and shouts loudly) The devil went to destroy the slaughterhouse of reason! (Steamship whistle sounds) Curtain. <118>

**Summary**

This one-act play, "The Apostate," depicts the intense conflict within a devout Christian family in colonial Korea. The stern Elder father clashes with his children, particularly his eldest son, Ki-byŏng, who has rejected religion and run away, and his eldest daughter, Ki-suk, who suffers from mental instability seemingly caused by the oppressive family atmosphere and her fiancé, a pastor. The plot escalates when Ki-byŏng secretly returns as part of a group planning to bomb churches, seeing them as "slaughterhouses of reason." His plan fails, his comrades are arrested, and after a tragic reunion with Ki-suk where he reveals his situation, she commits suicide using his pistol. Ki-byŏng is subsequently arrested, leaving the family shattered.

From a historical perspective, the play is significant for its portrayal of the tensions surrounding Christianity in early 20th-century Korea. It highlights generational conflict, the clash between rigid religious dogma and individual freedom or rebellion, and the psychological toll of such conflicts. The reference to bombing plots, potentially reflecting anti-establishment or even nascent nationalist sentiments directed against institutions perceived as foreign or oppressive (though the target here is specifically religious), provides insight into the turbulent social and political atmosphere under Japanese rule. The play's publication in *Kaebyŏk*, a magazine known for its critical stance, further suggests its engagement with contemporary social issues.
