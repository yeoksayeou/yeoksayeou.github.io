Preface

The scenic beauty of the peaks, rivers, pavilions, and temples of the Yeongnam region (嶺嶺表) surpasses all in the southeast. I intended to cast off worldly cares and travel there alone to appreciate even a fraction of it. Alas, my burdens* are too heavy, and illness constantly pursues me, making it impossible to go even now. Yet, when fragrant grasses mingle with flowers, or autumn trees shed their leaves, a lingering thought always torments my soul. Now, seeing this gazetteer (此誌), the mountains and rivers are like paintings, the pavilions and temples like reality, fully confirming what I had heard. After a while, I unconsciously found myself wandering among them with lofty scholars and leisurely folk. Inspired by these scenes, I could not help but write down my feelings.

Ulsan Taehwaru Pavilion
At the head of the Taehwa River stands the Taehwaru Pavilion, its red railings and painted structure reflected as if in a mirror. The fragrant grass, unaware that the people are gone, still covers the sandbanks fully when spring comes.

Yangsan T'ongdosa Temple
On Mt. Ch'wisŏsan stand three thousand Buddhas; east of T'ongdosa, ten thousand leagues of dust. The peeling gold visages suffer in return; half of those entering emptiness are people falling into emptiness.

Chinju Ŭiam Rock (Written because, while imprisoned, a person from Chinju told me about the events of 1919 [己未事] and requested a word)

The river water ripples, the river moon is cool; the solitary rock sobs, its faded beauty submerged. Today, a thousand years later, the tears of young women; the flowers perished then, their fragrance unending.

Kosŏng Kwanhaeru Pavilion
Steep cliffs, flat shores, intermittent sands; green tangerine groves, bamboo clumps, houses everywhere. Before the red glow sinks, the new moon rises; the vast blue sea for ten thousand leagues turns entirely to blossoms.

Ch'angwŏn Happ'oyŏng Garrison
An iron wall, a golden bath—the Happ'oyŏng Garrison. Two houses (高麗, 元) planned together for an eastern campaign. Who knew the rise and fall of a thousand years depended not on mountains and rivers, but on the use of troops? (During the Koryŏ Dynasty, Koryŏ and the Yuan [元] allied their forces here)

Kimhae Yŏnjalu Pavilion
Mountains pile upon mountains, waters flow on their own; the immortal spirits and royal aura have vanished into the vastness. Year after year, the most heart-wrenching place is Yŏnjalu Pavilion when the swallows arrive.

Miryang Yŏngnamnu Pavilion
Distant mountains, flat plains, the head of a long river; bamboo groves, fragrant orchids, a ten-ri sandbar. The most fitting place for wind and moon; a golden turtle emerges, holding up a tall pavilion.

Hapch'ŏn Haeinsa Temple
Moon halls and star palaces crown the East Sea [Korea]; a hundred kalpas created, a hundred times emptied. Who knew the eighty thousand Tripitaka blocks lie desolate amidst spider webs and bird droppings?

T'ongyŏng
The eastern and western garrison drums are silent; regret lingers for disarming too early back then. So many islands, crouching or flying; still protecting the orphaned city like children.

Tongnae County Kwajŏng Pavilion
The clouds of Haeundae are eternal; the moon over Mt. Kyemyŏngsan, a thousand autumns. Iron flute and jade pipes are both silent; only the magpies chatter, 'chiu chiu'. Blue mountains swallowed the golden turtle of old; the red sun sinks and rises towards Tsushima's head. Qin Shi Huang and Emperor Wu of Han wait in vain; dots of returning boats on the horizon. Where are they now? Washed away by waves, the water flows east. The eastward flow never ceases. Does the Chŏng Kwajŏng pavilion still stand?＜68＞

**Summary**

This work by Hwangsan consists of a preface and a series of short poems (Hansi) reflecting on famous historical sites and scenery in Korea's Yeongnam region (southeastern Korea). The author, unable to travel due to illness and unspecified "burdens," reads a gazetteer or record ("Yeongji") of the region, which inspires these verses. Each poem captures the essence of a specific location (Ulsan, T'ongdosa, Chinju, etc.), often evoking themes of natural beauty, historical memory, the passage of time, loss, and melancholy. For historians of the colonial period, the poems offer insight into how intellectuals perceived Korean history and landscape under Japanese rule. The explicit mention of the March 1st Movement (己未事) in the context of imprisonment (in the Jinju poem's note), the lament for military weakness (Tongyeong), and the general tone of reflecting on past glories and present desolation (Haeinsa, Kimhae) subtly convey nationalist sentiments and a sense of cultural loss during a time of occupation.
