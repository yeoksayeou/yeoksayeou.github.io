Japanese Debts in the Kyŏngnam Region

Even now, the term "Japanese Debts" (倭債 Waechae) makes our people there startle. That is, "Japanese Debts" refers to the harsh lending practices carried out by Japanese people residing in places like Pusan and T'ongyŏng since before the Japan-Korea Annexation (日韓合邦), through which they accumulated vast sums of wealth (財貸). The saying goes that while people there might postpone (遷延) payment for days or even default (沒食) when borrowing money from fellow Koreans, they wouldn't even entertain such a thought (念) when borrowing Japanese debt (日債).<43>

**Summary**

This news report from 1923 describes the lingering fear associated with "Japanese Debts" (Waechae) in the Kyŏngnam region of Korea. It explains that these debts originated from predatory lending by Japanese residents in port cities like Pusan and T'ongyŏng before the formal annexation in 1910. The article highlights the stark difference in repayment behavior: Koreans might delay or default on loans from other Koreans, but the fear of repercussions meant they dared not do so with Japanese creditors. From a historical perspective, this piece is interesting as it shows the deep economic penetration and exploitative power dynamics exerted by Japanese individuals even prior to formal colonial rule, establishing a system of financial control that instilled significant fear in the local Korean population. Historians might find this useful for understanding the pre-annexation economic conditions and the foundation of colonial economic exploitation.
