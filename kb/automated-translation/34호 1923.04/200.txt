智異山譜 (Jirisan Chronicles)

Chirisan (智異山) is a massive mountain sprawling across the western border of this province (本道). As a branch of Paektusan's (白頭山) range flowing southward, it became this mountain, hence it is also called Turyusan (頭流山). Another name is Pangjang (方丈). An old book states that Pangjang is located in Taebang (帶方) (south of Namwŏn County), which refers to this (There is a line in Du Fu's poem, "Pangjang is beyond the Three Han (方丈三韓外)," and its note says Pangjang is south of the Taebang Kingdom). Since the Silla era, it has been compared to Mount Heng (衡山), one of China's Five Great Mountains, and called Namak (南嶽, Southern Peak). Until the Yi Dynasty (李朝), the state performed ritual ceremonies (秩禮, name of a mountain ritual), so vulgar Confucians (俗儒輩) poisoned by Sinocentrism (慕華主義), just as they called Chosŏn "Little China (小中華)," also called Chirisan "Little Mount Heng (小衡山)." Also, some say Chirisan, along with Kŭmgangsan (金剛山, Pongnae 蓬萊) in Kwandong and Hallasan (漢拏山) on Cheju (濟州), has been called one of the Three Divine Mountains (三神山) since ancient times. Therefore, when Emperor Qin Shi Huang (秦始皇帝) of China sent the *fangshi* (方士, esoteric master) Sŏsi (徐市) with young boys and girls into the sea to seek the elixir of immortality (不死樂), Sŏ entered this mountain, passed through Kŭmsan (錦山) in Namhae, and went to Japan. Thus, it is said that the four characters "Sŏsi passed here (徐市過此)" still remain on a coastal cliff in Kŭmsan.

Its main range extends for hundreds of *ri* (里), spanning seven counties: Unbong (雲峰) and Namwŏn (南原) in Chŏlla North Province, and Hamyang (咸陽), Sanch'ŏng (山淸), Hadong (河東), Kŏch'ang (居昌), and Hapch'ŏn (陜川) in Kyŏngsang South Province. The entire mountain is composed of gneiss (片麻巖), and its topography is extremely majestic, steep, high, and vast. The summit, Ch'ŏnwangbong (天王峰), reaches an altitude of 6,600 *ch'ŏk* (尺, feet) above sea level. The forests are dense (鬱密), obscuring the sun and sky. The climate has both cold and warm aspects. Above the mid-peak (中峰), the temperature is very low, causing an abrupt change in the forest belt. Plants belonging to the so-called alpine flora, such as Siberian Juniper (眞栢) and ferns (羊齒), are abundant. Ice and snow often remain on the mountaintop until May or June. The poem by Yang Hŭi (梁喜, pen name Kujŏlam 九拙菴, a man of King Chungjong's 中宗 reign) goes: "Flowers fade below the mountain, snow remains on the peak; descending, one wears hemp cloth (絺綌), ascending, one wears fur (裘). Within one mountain, the vital energy (元氣) is uneven; in one day, one must tour through four seasons." This can be said to truly depict the climate of this mountain. Furthermore, the air on the mountaintop is thin, making it difficult to cook food. It is said that those ascending the mountain face great difficulties if they do not prepare food at the mid-peak.

The mountain's summit is divided into east and west, standing opposite each other above the clouds. The east is Ch'ŏnwangbong, and the west is Panyabong (般若峰). Ch'ŏnwangbong is the highest peak of this mountain. Reading the lines from the poem by Great Master Sŏsan (西山大師): "One ridge near heaven acts as the great ancestor, a thousand peaks line up like children and grandchildren. Sitting and watching the white sun rise beneath my eyes, red clouds and the blue sea swallow and spit each other," one can imagine how high and steep the peak is. On the north face of the peak (Hamyang border), there is an old fortress named Ch'usŏng (楸城), also called Pak Tongji (朴同址). It was built in ancient times by Silla to defend against Paekche (百濟). The ruins of storehouses are still clearly visible today, and nearby are the foundation sites of a temporary palace (行宮). About ten *ri* east of Ch'usŏng lies Pyoksongsa Temple (碧松寺). This is where the eminent monk of late Koryŏ, Zen Master Pyoksong (碧松禪師), practiced austerities. North of the temple is Yongyudam Pond (龍遊潭), <39> which is the downstream part of Imch'ŏn stream (臨川). Beside it, rocks are spread flat, and the pond water is deep black, its depth difficult to measure. In its water lives the *kasa* fish (袈裟魚, lit. 'kasaya fish'). Local residents relate that northwest of Chirisan lies Talkongsa Temple (達空寺, Unbong border) with Chŏyŏn Pond (猪淵) nearby. The *kasa* fish originates from this pond. Every year during the autumn season, it swims downstream to Yongyudam Pond, and in the spring, it returns to Chŏyŏn Pond. Therefore, below Ŏmch'ŏn stream (嚴川), this fish is entirely absent, they say. The mountain foot beyond belongs to the land granted (賜牌地) to Kang Hyep'yŏnggong Hyŏn (姜惠平公顯). On the rock faces left and right, there are numerous inscriptions by visitors from ancient and modern times. In the second year of King Sŏngjong (成宗) of the Yi Dynasty, when Master Kim Chŏmp'ilchae Chongjik (金佔畢齋宗直先生) was serving as the governor of Hamyang County, he composed poetry here with scholars like Yu Hoin (兪好仁), Cho Maegye Wi (曹梅溪偉), and Im Hoehŏn Taedong (林晦軒大同). The peaks Kŭmgang (金剛), Hyangno (香爐), and Munsu (文殊) opposite Pyoksongsa Temple, and Majŏktae Rock (馬跡臺), Songdae Terrace (松臺), and Kŭmdae Terrace (金臺) below the temple offer exceptionally beautiful scenery. Among them, Majŏktae, according to legend, was where the monk Majŏk Tosŭng (馬跡道僧) resided during the flourishing period of Buddhism in ancient times. He had a beloved donkey (驢) which he frequently sent back and forth across the Mach'ŏn'gang River (馬川江) using magic. He would hang his monk's staff (錫杖) on the opposite bank for the donkey to cross over. One day, he sent the donkey to the Unbong area. On its return, dragons were fighting noisily in Yongyudam Pond, so Majŏk Tosŭng could not hear the donkey's braying and did not set up the staff. The donkey, unable to cross, cried mournfully and died. Later, Majŏk saw his donkey dead and declared it the dragons' doing. He killed all the dragons in the pond, leaving only a one-eyed dragon (眇目) to guard Yongdam (龍潭). Thus, it is said that even now, its bloodstains are mottled (斑斑). Descending from this Majŏk Rock and heading east for several dozen *chan* (站, stages), one reaches Ŏido Island (䱗島). This is where Hannamgun Ŏ (漢南君 淤), the 12th son of King Sejong the Great (世宗大王) of the Yi Dynasty, lived in exile. During King Tanjong's (端宗) time, he, along with his older brother Kŭmsŏng Taegun Yu (錦城大君 瑜), suffered misfortune and was exiled to Hamyang. He resided on this island, which is why the village is still called Hannam (漢南) today. Odoch'i Pass (悟道峙) is located on the northern foot of Chirisan. Below it are the ruins of Tŭngguisa Temple (登龜寺), and further down is Yangjinjae Hall (養眞齋). This was the place where Master Kang Kyeam Ik (姜介菴先生翼) once resided. The valley is deep and secluded, and the springs and rocks are clean and pure, suitable for nurturing one's true nature (眞性), hence the name. The name Odo (悟道, Enlightenment Path) is also said to derive from the master. On the northeast foot of Odoch'i Pass lies Sŏgye Stream (西溪), considered the foremost scenic spot of water and rocks in southern Hamyang. Its source originates from P'allyanghyŏn Pass (八良峴) and reaches below Chehanyŏk Station (蹄閑驛). Between the two gorges, rocks are spread flat like an unfolded silk screen (錦屛). In the past, scholars Kim Tonggang Uong (金東岡宇顒), Kang Kyeam (姜介菴), No Okkye Chin (盧玉溪禛), and O Tŏkkye Kŏn (吳德溪健) together visited this place and composed the *Sŏgye Such'angnok* (西溪酬唱錄, Record of Exchanged Poems at Sŏgye Stream), after which its fame spread further in the world.

To the left and right of Panyabong Peak are two ridges named Hwangnyŏng (黃嶺) and Chŏngnyŏng (鄭嶺) (Chŏlla South Province border). In the past (during the reign of Emperor Zhao of Han 漢昭帝時), the king of Mahan (馬韓王), seeking refuge from the Chinbyŏn (辰弁) rebellion, had the two generals Hwang and Chŏng build fortifications here and maintained them for over 70 years. Therefore, later generations named the ridges after the surnames of these two generals. On the summit of Ch'ŏnwangbong stands Sŏngmosa Shrine (聖母祠, Holy Mother Shrine). The Holy Mother (聖母) has been <40> traditionally identified as Maya Devi (摩耶夫人), the mother of Shakyamuni Buddha (釋迦). However, Yi Sŭnghyu's (李承休) *Chewang Un'gi* (帝王韻記) states she is Queen Wisuk (威肅王后), the mother of King T'aejo (太祖) of Koryŏ (高麗). It is unknown which theory is correct. Master Kim Chŏmp'ilchae Chongjik (金宗直先生), in his *Yu Turyurok* (遊頭流錄, Record of Traveling Turyusan), debated this, saying: "The Koryŏ people, having heard the story of Sŏndo Sŏngmo (仙挑聖母, possibly referring to Seondo Holy Mother of Silla mythology), fabricated this story to divinize their king's lineage. Yi Sŭnghyu also recorded this in the *Un'gi*, so it cannot be verified." Master T'agyŏng Kim Ilsun (濯纓 金馹孫先生) considered the theory of Queen Wisuk to be closer to the truth. When Master Chŏmp'ilchae visited this mountain, clouds and mist obscured the view, making it difficult to see even a short distance. Following the advice of the accompanying monk Kongjong (空宗), he put on his official hat and robes (冠帶), washed his hands (盥洗), entered the Sŏngmosa Shrine, and performed a prayer ceremony for clear weather (祈晴祭) with offerings of wine and fruit (酒果). Indeed, the clouds dispersed, the mist cleared, and by midnight, the stars and moon shone brightly, illuminating heaven and earth, allowing him to fully appreciate the magnificent view of the mountains and sea. Thus, the master re-entered the shrine to express gratitude for the divine assistance (神休). Descending slightly south from the summit, one finds the ruins of Pyegyesa Temple (碧溪寺). Amidst the dense thicket (林莽), a solitary pagoda stands alone. Descending further, one reaches Munch'angdae Terrace (文昌臺), the place where Master Ch'oe Koun (崔孤雲先生, Ch'oe Ch'iwŏn), the Marquis of Munch'ang (文昌侯) of Silla, used to rest and relax. Winding southwestward into the Hadong border area, the two streams (雙溪) from Sinŭngdong (神凝洞) and Ch'ŏnghakdong (靑鶴洞) merge. Two rocks stand opposite each other like a gate (門). On the eastern rock, the two characters "Ssanggye" (雙溪) are carved, and on the western rock, "Sŏkmun" (石門, Stone Gate) are carved. This is the entrance to Ssanggyesa (雙溪寺), a famous temple of this mountain, and the calligraphy is said to be the work of Master Koun. (In front of Ssanggyesa Temple)

On the west side, statues of the Four Heavenly Kings (四天王), over two *chang* (丈, approx. 3 meters) tall, are enshrined; the carving is exquisite. Passing through the Stone Gate (石門) and walking for one *ri*, there is an ancient-looking stone stele (石碑). On its header, in ancient seal script (古篆體), are the nine characters "雙溪四故 眞鑑禪師碑" (Stele of the late Zen Master Chin'gam of Ssanggyesa). Beside it is written: "Respectfully composed by order, Ch'oe Ch'iwŏn (崔致遠), former Dutongsungwan Sŭngmurang Siŏsa Naegongbong, recipient of the Purple Gold Fish Pouch insignia. Erected in the 3rd year of Guangqi (光啓)." (Guangqi is the reign title of Emperor Xizong of Tang 唐僖宗). This is also said to be Master Koun's own handwriting. A few dozen steps north of the stele, there were over a hundred ancient pagoda trees (老槐) planted by Master Koun (now gone). Their roots crossed a small stream, naturally forming a bridge called Kŭmgyo (金橋, Gold Bridge). North of the temple are the ruins of P'aryŏngnu Pavilion (八詠樓), where Master Koun used to compose poems. Further west from here, about one *ri* away, the cliffs and valleys (崖谷) are steep and perilous. A path has been carved through the rock wall, barely wide enough for one person to pass. Below are unfathomable deep pools like Yongch'u (龍湫, Dragon's Pool) and Hakyŏn (鶴淵, Crane's Pool). Following the east side of Ssanggye stream for several *ri*, the valley opens up (洞府가 廣開), and the land becomes fertile, suitable for cultivation. This is Ch'ŏnghakdong (靑鶴洞, Blue Crane Valley). This Ch'ŏnghakdong has long been widely rumored, both inside and outside Korea, as the land of immortals (神仙) or one of the Ten Victory Sites (十勝之地). For instance, the ancient Chinese text *Chosŏnjij* (朝鮮誌, Record of Chosŏn) states: "In Chosŏn's Chirisan lies Ch'ŏnghakdong. Its four corners are spacious, and the five grains are abundant. However, only immortals and Buddhist monks reside there, and ordinary people cannot reach it. A pair of blue cranes always nests in the rock caves, and when they fly, they soar into the clouds, hence the valley's name." The *Chŏngdamnok* (鄭湛錄) says: "Below Chirisan is Ch'ŏnghakdong, a place where stones grow like seeds (升種石), producing ten thousand civil officials and ten thousand military officials (文千武萬)." Therefore, those seeking immortals or refuge from chaos often sought this valley. In the past, Yi Illo (李仁老) <41> also planned with a certain Minister Ch'oe (崔相國某) to find this valley. After passing Hwaŏmsa Temple (華嚴寺) and visiting Hwagaehyŏn (花開縣), he reached Sinhŭngsa Temple (神興寺) and lamented: "Every place passed is nothing but a fairyland. A thousand cliffs compete in beauty, ten thousand valleys vie in flow. Bamboo fences and thatched eaves are shaded by catalpa flowers (棑花). It is hardly the human world, but the so-called Ch'ŏnghakdong, I could never find." He inscribed the following lines on a rock and returned: "A thousand valleys and cliffs resemble Kuaiji (會稽), leaning on my staff, I sought Ch'ŏnghakdong; in the bamboo grove, I often heard white apes cry. Pavilions are misty and distant like the three immortal mountains; mosses are obscure on the four-character inscription. I venture to ask, where is the immortal source? Falling flowers and flowing water make one sorrowful." West of Ssanggyesa Temple lie Agyangdong (岳陽洞) and Hwagaedong (花開洞), where the water and rocks are very beautiful. Agyang was where Halloksa Yu Han (韓錄事惟漢) abandoned his official post and lived in seclusion during the mid-Koryŏ period to escape the tyrannical chaos caused by Yi Chagyŏm (李資謙). At that time, the king sent an envoy to summon Han. Han declined, saying, "Your humble servant knows nothing, so I cannot easily accept the royal command," and shut his door, refusing to come out. The envoy forced the door open and looked inside. Only a line of poetry was on the wall: "A single silken thread of imperial decree enters the valley; only then do I know my name has fallen into the human world." Han had escaped through the north window. Later generations call this Han Yu Han's poem. Hwagae is the former residence of Master Chŏng Iltu Yŏch'ang (鄭一蠹汝昌先生). His poem: "Wind rustles through the cattails (風蒲), gently playing; in April Hwagae (花開), wheat is already autumn-ripe. Having seen all of Turyu's (頭流) ten thousand folds, my lone sail goes down the great river's flow again," was composed in this village. On the rock walls along the stream, there are many examples of Ch'oe Koun's calligraphy. During the Sinmyo year (辛卯年) of King Sŏnjo's (宣廟) reign, a monk found a piece of paper among the rocks. Written on it was: "East Country's Hwagaedong, a separate heaven within a jar (壺中別有天). Immortals push jade pillows, body and world span a thousand years." The writing was so clear it looked newly written, and moreover, the brushwork was identical to Koun's. Thus, popular belief holds that Koun attained the Way (道), remains immortal to this day, travels back and forth between Chirisan and Kayasan (伽倻山), and shows such tangible traces to the world. Tŏksan (德山) in Sanch'ŏng County (originally Chinju 晉州 territory) is a deep valley, like being inside a jar (壺中). It was the place where Master Cho Nammyŏng Sik (曹南冥先生植) lived in seclusion. The Sanch'ŏnjae study hall (山天齋) where the master read books still exists in the valley, along with his memorial shrine (祀宇) and tomb (墓所). At the entrance of the valley, there is a trace where the master inscribed "Iptŏkmun" (入德門, Entering Virtue Gate) in large characters on a rock when he entered the mountain. Recently, during road repairs, this was destroyed. A copy was re-carved on a nearby rock, but the master's spirited brushwork (立神한 筆法) of the past is hard to see again. People who superstitiously believe the prophecy in *Chŏngdamnok*, which says "When thunder breaks the stone gate (雷破石門), horses and carriages (駟馬) will come and go, and the true lord (眞主) will emerge," see the destruction of this Iptŏkmun and the passage of automobiles as confirming the secret record (秘記). It is said that even now, many people come to Chirisan seeking refuge.

What has been outlined above are the famous places and historical sites of Chirisan. However, Chirisan is not just rich in famous places and historical sites; it is also a natural treasure trove (寶庫). Possessing both cold and warm climates and fertile soil, it abounds in flora and fauna. Among these, tigers (虎), leopards (豹), bears (熊), deer (鹿), pheasants (翬翟), blue cranes (靑鶴), types of pine (唐檜, 海松, 赤松), oaks and related trees (標, 樫, 楢欅), paper mulberry (楮), lacquer tree (漆), types of bamboo (苦竹, 淡竹, 女竹), <42> persimmon (柿), chestnut (栗), medicinal herbs like ginseng (人蔘), dangwi (當歸, Angelica gigas), purple reishi mushroom (紫芝), Poria cocos mushroom (茯苓), mushrooms like pyogo (榷茸, shiitake), sŏgi (石茸, stone ear mushroom), and other mountain vegetables (山菜) are found in quantities unseen in other mountains. Also, due to the abundance of timber, the manufacturing of woodenware (木器) and charcoal (木炭) flourishes, with export values reaching tens of thousands of won (圓). However, we Koreans have traditionally known this Chirisan only as the land of immortals and failed to recognize it as a treasure trove. While we were reciting poems about the clear wind and bright moon (淸風明月) and breathing in the purple mist and colorful clouds (紫烟彩霞) within the deep Ch'ŏnghakdong, the entirety of Chirisan has already fallen into Japanese hands. That is, in the first year of Taishō (大正元年, 1912), the Government-General granted it as practice forests (演習林) for the so-called Kyushu University and Kyoto University on a long-term, 80-year free lease (無償貸付) (Regarding the university practice forests, it has been discussed in detail elsewhere, so only a brief mention here). Indeed, does Chirisan have immortals or not? Who would have thought that fishermen (漁子) would intrude upon Wuling's Peach Blossom Spring (武陵桃源)? Currently, Mr. Min Inho (閔麟鎬氏), the governor of Hamyang County, has organized the Posŭnghoe (保勝會, Association for Preserving Scenic Beauty) to preserve at least the empty shell (空殼) of famous places and historical sites and is compiling the *Chirisanji* (智異山誌, Chirisan Gazetteer) to introduce Chirisan to the world. Mr. Kang Wisu (姜渭秀氏), a local patriot from the same county, is building the Manghaejŏng Pavilion (望海亭) on the mountain for the convenience of visitors. Pak Noik (朴魯翊) and the monks of Yŏngwŏnsa Temple (靈源寺僧) have built the Chesŏktang Hall (帝釋堂), while Yi Chinu (李璡雨) and the monks of Pyoksongsa Temple (碧松寺僧) have built the Maamdang Hall (馬岩堂) (both locations are on the mid-peak). They plan to hold an opening ceremony (開山式) in the beautiful spring season this year. Should this be called the fortune of this mountain... December 5th <43>

**Summary**

This 1923 article provides a detailed account of Chirisan (Mt. Jiri), covering its geography, mythology, historical sites, famous visitors, natural resources, and legends. It describes the mountain's physical characteristics, climate, key peaks like Ch'ŏnwangbong and Panyabong, and associated stories involving historical figures (Kim Chongjik, Ch'oe Ch'iwŏn, Cho Sik), temples (Pyoksongsa, Ssanggyesa), and mythical places like Ch'ŏnghakdong (Blue Crane Valley), traditionally viewed as a utopia. The article also lists the mountain's rich biodiversity and timber resources. Critically, it laments that while Koreans revered Chirisan as a spiritual sanctuary, its tangible value was overlooked, leading to its resources being leased long-term (80 years, free of charge) to Japanese universities (Kyushu and Kyoto) as practice forests by the Government-General in 1912. It concludes by mentioning contemporary efforts by locals (like the Hamyang governor and others) to preserve the remaining heritage and promote tourism, questioning if this is the mountain's "fortune."

From a colonial history perspective, the article is revealing. It starkly contrasts the traditional Korean spiritual and cultural reverence for Chirisan with the colonial administration's pragmatic exploitation of its natural resources for Japanese benefit. The mention of the 80-year free lease of vast forest lands to Japanese universities highlights the economic and resource extraction policies of the Japanese Government-General. The concluding lament and description of local preservation efforts underscore a sense of loss and nascent resistance/adaptation among Koreans under colonial rule, trying to reclaim or preserve what remains of their natural and cultural heritage within the imposed system. Historians might find the juxtaposition of cultural appreciation and colonial exploitation, the specific details of the land lease, and the mention of contemporary Korean responses (Posŭnghoe, gazetteer compilation, new constructions) particularly interesting.

智異山譜
智異山은 本道西境에 盤礡한 巨山이니 白頭山의 支脉이 南流하야 此山이 됨으로 一名은 頭流山이라 칭하고 又 별명은 方丈이니 古書에 云한 바 方丈은 帶方(南原郡 南)에 在하다 함이 즉 是ㅡ다(杜甫詩에 方丈三韓外라는 句가 有한데 其註에 方丈은 帶方國 南에 在한다 云함). 往昔 新羅의 時로부터 中國 五嶽의 一인 衡山에 비하야 南嶽이라 칭하고 李朝에 至하기까지 국가에서 秩禮(山祭名)를 행한 고로 慕華主義에 중독된 俗儒輩들은 朝鮮을 小中華라 칭하덧이 智異山을 小衡山이라 칭하기도 하고 又 或說에 智異山은 關東의 金剛山(蓬萊)과 湖南의 漢拏山(濟州)과 共히 고대부터 三神山이라 칭함으로 支那의 秦始皇帝가 方土徐市로 童男童女를 率하고 海에 入하야 不死樂을 구할새 徐가 此山에 入하얏다가 南海錦山을 經하야 日本으로 往한 故로 錦山海岸絶壁에 徐市過此 四字가 今에도 尙在하다 한다.
其幹脈은 수백리에 延亙하야 全北의 雲峰, 南原과 慶南의 咸陽, 山淸, 河東, 居昌, 陜川 등 7郡을 跨하고 全山이 片麻巖으로 成하얏는데 산세가 극히 雄峻高大하야 上峯天王은 해발 6,600척에 달하고 삼림이 鬱密하야 天日을 掩蔽하며 기후는 寒溫이 兼有하야 中峰 이상은 寒度가 甚高함으로 植林帶가 忽變하야 소위 고산식물에 속한 眞栢, 羊齒의 類가 多하고 5,6월까지 山上에는 氷雪이 常在하니 梁喜(號九拙菴, 中宗朝人) 詩에 「山下花殘山上雪, 下山絺綌上山裘, 一山元氣不齊處一日須兼四節遊」라 함은 실로 此 山氣候의 眞狀을 畵하얏다 可謂하겟스며 且山上에는 공기가 희박하야 식물을 烹熱키 難함으로 上山하는 人이 中峰에서 食物을 準備치 안이하면 곤란이 多大하다 한다.
산의 上峰은 東西로 分하야 雲表에 대립하얏스니 東은 天王이오 西는 般若라. 天王峰은 此山의 天王峰은 此山의 최고봉이니 西山大師 詩에 「一嶺近天作高祖, 千峰列立爲兒孫. 坐看白日生眼底, 紅霞碧海相吐呑」이라는 句을 讀하야도 其峰이 如何히 高峻한 것을 可想하겟다. 峰의 北面(咸陽界)에는 古城이 有하니 名은 楸城이오, 又 名은 朴同址니 고대에 新羅가 百濟를 방어하기 위하야 築한 者이라 今에도 창고의 遺址가 宛在하고 其附近에 行宮의 基址가 亦有하며 楸城東十里許에 碧松寺가 有하니 此는 麗末의 高僧 碧松禪師의 수도하던 處오 寺의 北便에는 龍遊潭이 有하니＜39＞ 즉 臨川의 下流ㅡ라. 其傍에 암석이 平鋪하고 潭水는 深黑하야 其深을 難測인데 其水中에는 袈裟魚가 有하니 居人이 相傳하되 智異山 西北에 達空寺(雲峰界)가 有하고 其傍에 猪淵이 有한데 袈裟魚가 此淵에서 産하야 매년 秋節을 당하면 順流下遊하야 龍遊潭에 至하얏다가 春節에는 猪淵으로 復還하는 故로 嚴川 以下에는 此魚가 全無하다 云한다. 其越邊의 山麓은 姜惠平公顯의 賜牌地라 左右石面에 古今 遊覽人의 題名이 甚多하니 李朝 成宗 2년에 金佔畢齋宗直先生이 咸陽郡守로 在할 時에 兪好仁, 曹梅溪偉, 林晦軒大同 諸賢으로 此에서 嘯詠하얏고 碧松寺 對岸의 金剛, 香爐, 文殊 諸峰과 寺下에 在한 馬跡臺, 松臺, 金臺 등은 景槪가 絶勝한데 其中 馬跡臺는 전설에 의하면 고대 불교가 전성할 시에 馬跡道僧이 此地에 居하얏는데 最愛하는 一匹의 驢가 有하야 常하 도술로 馬川江을 왕래케 할 새 錫杖을 彼岸에 掛하고 其上으로 渡케 하더니 1일은 該驢를 雲峰 등지에 送하얏다가 귀환할 際에 龍遊潭에서 群龍이 爭鬪喧聒함으로 馬跡道僧이 該驢의 鳴 聲을 聞치 못하야 錫杖을 架設치 안이하얏슴으로 該驢가 통과함을 得치 못하고 哀鳴하다가 死한지라. 其 後에 馬跡이 其驢의 死함을 見하고 此는 龍의 所爲라 하야 潭中의 龍을 盡殺하고 但히 眇目한 一龍만 殘留하야 龍潭을 守케 하얏슴으로 지금에도 其 血痕이하 斑斑다 한다. 此馬跡岩을 下하야 東으로 數十 站에 至하면 䱗島가 有하니 此는 李朝 世宗大王의 제12子 漢南君 어의 謫居하던 處라 端宗時에 其兄 錦城大君 瑜와 共히 禍에 罹하야 咸陽에 定配되얏슬 시에 此島에 居한 故로 今에도 其村을 漢南이라 칭한다. 悟道峙는 智異山 北麓에 在하니 其下에 登龜寺 遺址가 有하고 又其下에 養眞齋가 有하니 此는 昔日에 姜介菴先生翼의 棲息하던 處이라. 洞谷이 深邃하고 泉石이 청결하야 가히 眞性을 養할만한 故로 명명함이오, 悟道의 名도 선생을 因하야 得하얏다 한다. 悟道峙 東北麓에는 西溪가 有하니 咸陽南部의 水石名區로 第一指를 屈하는 處이라. 其源이 八良峴에서 出하야 蹄閑驛下에 至하니 兩峽의 間에 암석이 平鋪하야 錦屛을 張함과 如하고 昔에 金東岡宇顒, 姜介菴, 盧玉溪禛, 吳德溪健 諸賢이 共히 此에 遊覽하야 西溪酬唱錄을 作한 이후로 其名이 世에 益著하얏다.
般若峰 좌우에는 兩嶺이 有하니 名은 黃嶺, 鄭嶺(全南界)이라. 昔에 (漢昭帝時) 馬韓王이 辰弁의 亂을 피하기 위하야 黃, 鄭 兩將으로 하야금 此에 築城하고 70여년을 보수하얏슴으로 後人이 仍히 二將의 姓으로 其嶺을 名하얏고 天王峰上에는 聖母祠가 有하니 聖母는 古來＜40＞ 相傳하되 釋迦의 母 摩耶夫人이라 하고 李承休 帝王韻記에는 고려 태조의 妣 威肅王后라 云하얏슨즉 何說이 是한지 不知하나 佔畢齋 金宗直선생 遊頭流錄에 此를 辨하야 曰 高麗人이 仙挑聖母의 說을 習聞하고 其君의 系를 神明코자하야 是說을 창출하얏는데 李承休가 亦 此를 韻記에 기재하얏스니 可徵치 못하갯다 하얏고 濯纓 金馹孫선생은 威肅王后라 云하는 說이 近是하다 하얏다. 佔畢齋선생이 此山에 遊할 時에 雲霧가 晦寞하야 지척을 難辨함으로 從僧 空宗의 言에 의하야 冠帶盥洗하고 聖母祀에 入하야 酒果로써 祈晴祭를 행하얏더니 과연 雲이 收하고 霧가 霽하야 夜半에 星月이 皎皎하고 천지가 明豁하야 山海의 壯觀을 遂하얏슴으로 선생이 更히 廟에 入하야 神休의 賴함을 謝하얏섯다. 上峯에서 南으로 少下하ㅑ면 碧溪寺의 遺址가 有하니 林莽中에 孤塔이 의연 獨存하고 又少下하면 文昌臺가 有하니 此는 新羅 文昌侯 崔孤雲선생의 遊息하던 處이오, 西南으로 逶迤하야 河東界에 至하면 神凝, 靑鶴 兩洞에서 來하는 雙溪가 합류하고 兩石이 門과 如히 대립하얏는데 東邊의 石에는 雙溪 2字를 刻하고 西邊의 石에는 石門 2字를 刻하얏스니 此는 本山의 名刹 雙溪의 洞門이오 其筆蹟은 孤雲선생의 遺墨이라 云한다. (雙溪寺前)
西側에는 2丈餘나 되는 四天王의 像을 안치하얏스니 조각이 甚妙하고 又石門을 由하야 1里를 行하면 古色이 蒼然한 石碑가 有하니 其額에는 古篆軆로 「雙溪四故 眞鑑禪師碑」 9字를 書하고 傍에는 「前西國都統巡官承務郞侍御史內供奉賜紫金魚袋臣崔致遠奉敎撰, 光啓3年建」이라 書하얏스니(光啓는 唐 僖宗 연호) 此도 亦 孤雲선생의 친필이라 한다. 碑北 數十步에는 孤雲선생의 手植한 百餘園의 老槐가 有한데(今無) 其根이 小洞을 渡하야 자연으로 橋를 成하얏스니 號曰 金橋라 하고 寺北에는 孤雲선생의 遊詠하던 八詠樓遺址가 有하며 又 此等에서 西方으로 1리에 至하면 崖谷이 峻險한데 壁間에 一路를 鑿通하얏스니 僅히 1人만 통과하게 될 뿐이오 其下에는 可測치 못할 龍湫, 鶴淵 등 深池가 잇고 雙演의 東을 緣하야 數里를 行하면 洞府가 廣開하고 토지가 비옥하야 경작에 適宜하니 此는 靑鶴洞이다. 此靑鶴洞은 自來 世人이 신선의 鄕이니 十勝之地니 하야 內外에 暄傳하던 바이라. 즉 고대 중국인 朝鮮誌에는 云하되 「朝鮮智異山中有靑鶴洞四隅寬曠五穀豊穰但仙人釋子居住而世人不能到處也靑鶴一雙樓止岩穴間飛騰時決起雲宵故標洞名」이라 하얏고 鄭湛錄에는 「智異山下有靑鶴洞升種石出文千武萬之地」라 云하얏슴으로 世에 仙을 訪하고 亂을 避코자하는 者 ㅡ 往往이 此洞을 尋하얏섯다. 昔에 李仁老가＜41＞ 역시 崔相國某로 더부려 此洞을 尋하기로 約하고 華嚴寺를 經하야 花開縣을 觀한 후 神興寺에 至하야 歎曰 所過가 無非仙境이라. 千岩이 競秀하고 萬壑이 爭流하며 竹籬茅含에 棑花가 掩暎하니 殆히 人間이 안이나 所謂 靑鶴洞은 종래 尋치 못하겠다하고 萬壑千岩似會稽, 策杖欲尋靑 鶴洞, 階林頻聽白猿啼, 樓臺縹渺三山遠, 苔蘇徵茫四字題, 試問仙源河處是, 落花流水使人愁」의 句를 岩石에 題하고 歸하얏섯다. 雙溪寺 西便에는 岳陽, 花開 兩洞이 有하야 水石이 甚佳하니 岳陽은 高麗 중엽에 韓錄事惟漢이 李資謙의 亂橫을 피하야 官을 棄하고 은거하던 處이라. 其時에 왕이 使를 遣하야 韓을 迎코자 하니 韓이 謝하야 曰 外臣이 知하는 바가 無한즉 왕명을 가히 용이히 受치 못하겟다 하고 閉戶不出함으로 使者가 戶를 排하고 入하야 視하니 壁上에 오즉 「一片絲綸來入洞始知名字落人間」이라는 詩句만 잇고 韓은 北牖를 從하야 逃去하얏슴으로 後人이 此를 韓惟漢의 詩라 云한다. 花開는 鄭一蠹汝昌 선생의 故居地니 선생의 詩 「風蒲獵獵弄輕柔四月 花開麥己秋看盡頭 流千萬疊孤帆又下大江流」는 즉 此里에 題한 바이오 沿溪石壁間에는 崔孤雲의 필적이 多하니 宣廟 辛卯年間에 一僧이 岩石間에서 紙片을 得하얏는데 其紙에 書하얏스되 「東國花開洞壼中別有天仙人推玉枕身世條千年」이라 한 바 其字畵이 선명하야 新히 書한 者와 如할 뿐 안이라 筆法이 孤雲과 同함으로 속설에 孤雲이 道를 得하야 지금까지 不死하코 智異, 伽倻 兩山으로 왕래하면서 如斯한 實蹟을 세인에게 見한다 云한다. 山淸郡界의 德山(元晋州地)은 洞府가 深邃하야 壼中과 如하니 曹南冥선생植의 은거하던 處라. 其洞에 선생이 독서하던 山天齋가 지금 尙在하고 且 先生의 祀宇와 墓所가 有하며 洞口에는 선생이 入山할 時에 「入德門」 3字를 大書하야 岩石에 刻한 遺蹟이 有하더니 근래 道路改修할 時에 此를 파괴하고 其傍岩石에 此를 模本하야 更刻하얏스나 前日 선생의 입신한 筆法은 更見키 難하다. 鄭湛錄의 소위 「雷破石門駟馊�出入眞主出來」라는 예언을 미신하는 세인들은 此入德門의 파괴와 자동차의 통행을 見하고 秘記와 부합한다하야 今에도 智異山으로 피난하러 來하는 자가 多하다 한다.
이상에 개론한 것은 智異山의 名所古蹟이어니와 智異山은 但히 名所古蹟이 多할 뿐 안이라 亦 천연의 寶庫다. 寒溫의 기후를 겸하고 토지가 富沃하야 동식물이 풍부하니 其中 虎, 豹, 熊, 鹿, 翬翟, 靑鶴의 類와 唐檜, 海松, 赤松, 標, 樫, 楢欅, 楮, 漆, 苦竹, 淡竹, 女竹,＜42＞ 柿栗의 屬과 人蔘, 當歸, 紫芝, 茯芩 등의 약재와 榷茸(표고), 石茸, 기타 山菜 등은 其量의 多함이 他山에서 可見치 못하것고 且木材가 多함으로 木器, 木炭의 제조가 盛하야 其輸出額이 屢萬圓에 달한다. 그러나 我朝鮮人은 此 智異山을 自來 신선의 鄕으로만 知하고 寶庫인 줄은 知치 못하얏다. 深深한 淸鶴洞 중에서 淸風明月을 吟弄하며 紫烟彩霞를 호흡하는 間에 智異山의 전부 旣히 일본인의 수중에 歸하얏다. 즉 大正 元年에 소위 九州大學 及 京都大學의 演習林으로 總督府에서 80개년의 長期로 無償貸付를 하고 말엇다(大學演習林에 관하야는 별로 詳論하얏기 玆에 畧記함). 과연 智異山은 신선이 有한가 否한가. 武陵桃源에 엇지 漁子가 침입할 줄 意하얏슬리오. 현재 咸陽郡守 閔麟鎬씨는 空殼의 名勝古蹟이나마 보존하랴고 保勝會를 조직하고 智異山을 세계에 소개하기 위하야 智異山誌를 葺輯 중이오, 同郡有志 姜渭秀씨는 遊山하는 人의 편리를 圖키 위하야 山上에 望海亭을 건축하고 朴魯翊 及 靈源寺僧 一同은 帝釋堂을 건축하얏스며 李璡雨 及 碧松寺僧 一同은 馬岩堂을 건축하야 (兩處는 皆 中峯) 本年 陽春佳節에 開山式을 行하랴 한다. 此가 本山의 幸이라 할지... 12월 5일＜43＞
