Poetry of the Expressionist School
						Kim Myŏngsun (Translator)
Poetry of the Expressionist School = Poetry of the Symbolist School
Poetry of the Post-Impressionist School = Poetry of the Decadent School (惡魔派)

(一) Poetry of the Expressionist School
						(By Franz Werfel)
Laughter
Create, Carry, Sustain,
A thousand reservoirs of laughter in your hands!
Laughter, the heavenly blessed moisture,
Spreads full across the faces of every person.
Laughter is not wrinkles,
Laughter is the essence of light (光).
Light shines through space,
But it is still mistaken.
Even the sun is not light.
Only upon the human face, oh,
Will light become laughter and be born.
Through the blinking, light, immortal gates,
Wandering out through the gates of eye to eye,
The first spring, the yeast of the cosmos,
Laughter, an unparalleled burning cauterization.
Wash your worn-out old hands with fiercely pouring laughter,
Create, Carry, Sustain! <50>

Tragic Destiny

						(Hermann Kasack)
I run along the evening coast, the heavenly scenery passes luxuriantly. Wandering animals too—I run—people die one after another, I have cast off all the sorrow that surrounded me. The shape of a true human finally appears, oh, truly unmistakable, this joy of consolation—oh, is it music, oh, is this love, let me linger in this pleasant thought.
I run—leap up like a gale. Blindly, blindly, I step backward, circling the same place. I leaped up as my heart desired, upward! Leaped toward it, and I hang on! Have I reached the end—if not this, where can I set my foot? Ah, I run!

(二) Poetry of the Symbolist School
I Searched

						(By Maurice Maeterlinck)
I searched for thirty years, oh sister,
For her hidden house.
I searched for thirty years, oh sister,
Yet she was nowhere to be found.
I searched for thirty years, oh sister,
Now even my footsteps are about to weaken,
Though she might be somewhere, oh sister,
She is still nowhere to be seen.
Time sadly passes, oh sister,
Take my shoes, and leave them,
The evening sun is fading too, oh sister,
Now my heart too has grown weary.
You are still young, oh sister,
Wander wherever you may,
Take my pilgrim's staff, oh sister,
Search for her like I did.

Snow
						(Remy de Gourmont)
Simone, the snow is white like your earlobe,
Simone, the snow is white like your two knees. <51>
Simone, your hands are cold like snow.
Simone, your heart is cold like snow.

A kiss of fire to melt the snow,
A kiss of parting to thaw your heart.
Snow is on the desolate pine branch,
Your forehead is beneath desolate black hair.

Simone, your younger sister (Snow Maiden) sleeps in the yard.
Simone, you are my snow, and my lover.

(三) Poetry of the Post-Impressionist School
Tavern

						(Horace Holley)
The grapevine wishing for the sun,
Its shape branching upward toward life,
Is but a handful of grapes, heavy with promise,
But escaping darkness, gladly,
Foam rises and overflows.
In the whisper of new life, oh glittering world, then, oh grapes,
Within my blood of self-forgetting,
Will rise higher toward the sun,
Than in the slow, laboring grapevine.

Thus I drink,
The sun's wine, its brilliance.
Giving abundant life again in my blood,
Giving again a conscious life of abundant thought and joy.
But, on the horizon of the soul, wishing for the ultimate sun,
It too shall perish like a withered leaf.
I pray, oh God, descend upon me,
Just as I have drunk my grapes,
Drink my body, oh Lord, perfect in this moment,
That I may live thus forever.

(四) Poetry of the Decadent School (惡魔派)
The Raven / (Only three of eighteen stanzas from Allan Poe's poem)
						Edgar Allan Poe
Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, <52>
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
"'Tis some visitor," I muttered [outside the door], "tapping at my chamber door— Only this and nothing more."

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore— Nameless here for evermore.

And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—"

"'Some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;— This it is and nothing more."
To Helen

						(By Edgar Allan Poe)
Helen, thy beauty is to me
Like those Nicéan barks of yore,
That gently, o'er a perfumed sea,
The weary, way-worn wanderer bore
To his own native shore.

On desperate seas long wont to roam,
Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,
Thy Naiad airs have brought me home
To the glory that was Greece,
And the grandeur that was Rome.
Lo! in yon brilliant window-niche
How statue-like I see thee stand,
With agate lamp within thy hand!
Ah, Psyche, from the regions which
Are Holy-Land! <53>

The Death of the Poor

						(By Charles Baudelaire)
It is Death that consoles us, alas!
It is Death that makes us live;
It is the goal of life, the only hope,
Which, like an elixir, lifts our heads and makes us drunk,
And gives us the courage to advance bravely until the end of the day.

Through the storm, the frost, and the snow,
It is the trembling radiance on our dark horizon;
It is the famous inn written of in ancient books, —
Where we can eat and rest and sleep.

It is an Angel who holds in magical hands
The gift of sleep, and ecstatic dreams,
And remakes the beds of the poor and destitute.
It is the glory of the Gods, the mystic granary,
The poor man's purse, their ancient homeland,
It is the great portico opening onto unknown Heavens!
Damned Women (Femmes Damnées)

						(By Charles Baudelaire)
'[...] whom my soul has followed even to hell,
I love and pity you, ah, my poor sisters.
Your desires are hard to quench,
Your pains are unspeakable,
And your great hearts are urns of sacred love!'
...(September 1922)... <54>

**Summary**

This article presents Korean translations of various European modernist poems, categorized by Kim Myŏngsun into Expressionist, Symbolist, Post-Impressionist, and "Devil School" (Decadent) categories. It includes works by prominent poets such as Franz Werfel, Maurice Maeterlinck, Remy de Gourmont, Edgar Allan Poe, and Charles Baudelaire. The translations attempt to capture the distinct moods and themes of each poetic school, from the vitalism of Expressionism to the aestheticism and darker themes of Symbolism and Decadence. From a historical perspective, this article is significant as it showcases the active engagement of Korean intellectuals, specifically a pioneering female writer like Kim Myŏngsun, with contemporary Western literary movements during the Japanese colonial period. It reflects the efforts to introduce and interpret foreign modernism within the Korean cultural context of the early 1920s, demonstrating a desire to participate in global intellectual currents despite colonial constraints.

(一) 表現派의詩
						(프란쓰. 벹펠 作)
웃음
創成하라, 運搬하라, 持續하라,
웃음의一千貯水池를 네손가운대!
웃음은, 天福濕潤은
모든사람사람의얼굴에그득펴잇다.
웃음은주름살이아니라,
웃음은빗(光)의本質이라.
빗은空間을通하여빗날리나,
그러나그는아즉그르다.
太陽일지라도빗이아니다.
사람의얼굴우에비롯오,
빗은웃음이되어서생겨나올것이라.
눈박거리는, 가비여운, 죽는일업는門으로,
눈과눈의문(門)으로 巡遊해나은,
最初의春, 天體의酵母
웃음, 類업시타는 燒灼.
激烈하게쏘다지는웃음으로늙어진손을씻으라,
創成하라 運搬하라, 持續하라!＜50＞

悲劇的運命

						(헤루만 가작크)
나름다름질하다저녁海岸을하서, 天上의風光이무럭무럭지나간다. 彷徨하고잇는動物도-나는다름질하다―사람은차레차레죽어가서, 나를 에워싸든설음은다처버렷다. 眞實한人間의모양이드듸어뵈이다, 오오참으로틀림업는 이慰勞의喜悅-오오그는音樂이냐, 오오이는사랑이냐, 이快想가운대나를 머물게하라.
나는다름질하다―疾風과가티어오르다. 盲目盲目나는뒷거름질하다 가튼곳을빙빙돌앗다. 나는本心대로어올랏다 上方에!向해어올랏다 그리고나는매어달리다! 막다랏슬가―그나다르면어대에自己를 踏止케하는것인가? 아아나는다름질하다!

(二) 象徵派의詩
나는차젓다

						(메텔링크 作)
나는三十年間차젓다. 누의야,
저의숨겨잇는집
나는三十年間차젓다, 누의야,
그래도저는어곳에도잇지안터라.
나는三十年間차젓단이다, 누의야,
只今은내발소리도衰弱하려저,
저는어곳에나잇서도, 누의야,
아즉어느곳에서도뵈지안하.
는슯게도지나가 누의야,
내신을잡으라, 그리고노흐라,
夕陽도어슬어저가는데, 누의야,
只今은내맘도알아지첫다.
그대는아즉젊다, 누의야,
어는곳이든지彷徨해보라,
내行脚의집행이를 잡고, 누의야,
나와가티저를 차저求하야.

눈
						(굴-몬-ㅅ)
시몬, 눈은네귀밋가티희다,
시몬, 눈은네두무릅가티희다. ＜51＞
시몬, 네손은눈과가티차다.
시몬, 네맘은눈과가티차다.

눈을녹이는데는火의키쓰
네마음을푸는데는離別의키쓰.
눈은悽凉한松枝우에,
네이마는悽凉한검은머리알에.

시몬, 너의동생 (妹雪)은에서자고잇다.
시몬, 너는내눈, 그리고내愛人.

(三) 後期印象派의詩
酒場

						(호레쓰, 호레이 作)
葡萄ㅅ덩굴太陽을바래고,
生命에, 上方에가지벗는모양이어
다만증태긴한줌의葡萄,
그나暗黑을버서나서欣然히,
거품올라넘친다.
新生의쏙새기에, 閃爛한世界여, 그러면葡萄여,
내忘我의血液가운대서,
太陽을向해더놉히오르리라,
遲遲勞苦하는葡萄樹에잇는것보다도.

이가티나는마시다,
太陽에술 그빗난것을.
나의血液속에서다시넉넉한生命을주고,
다시豊富한思想과喜悅과의, 意識하는生命을준다
그러하나, 靈魂의地平線우에, 究極의太陽을바래서,
그도將次枯葉과가티 滅하리라.
願컨대神이어, 나에게降臨합쇼,
내葡萄를 마신것가티
나의몸을마시옵소서, 내只今瞬間에完全한것,
永遠히이가티살기를 爲하야.

大鴉/(알란. 포의詩十八節中三節만)
						알란. 포
녯날, 鬱陶한깁흔밤이엇다, 困憊하여思慮하며＜52＞
珍奇한古書를 피서 니즌것을參考할
半은졸려서굽어질 突然히들기는소리를 듯다.
누구일가아조가볍게치다 나잇는房문을.
『손인가』고나는門밧게나섯다, 『들기다내방문을-들길이지 아모도업다.』

悽凉히나는생각한다 嚴寒의深夜이라,
불타든숫은흐터저 마루에 그림자를 어털엿섯다.
나는懇切히아츰을기다리며
갑업시내책으로憂慮를 니즈려하다-
憂慮는누구문에, 업슨『테노아』,
드물게나타나는 仙女의불으는이름은『테노아』………世上에는업는이름이되. 高貴하다. 『테노아』

보들어운설음, 不安한動搖, 窓바른紫絹의소새기몸에도사못처서 이러한恐怖는몰랏섯다.
그러나只今은 리는가슴을鎭定하고

『손인가, 왓스면 천천히들어오기를 바란다』………그러나 이러할이지 아모도업다.
헤렌에게

						(알란. 포- 作)
아름다운헤렌은
옛적 니게의小舟와도갓더라
고요하고 甘美로운波路를 , 멀리
疲困하여수척한사람모양으로
故鄕의沿岸에向하야.

세상風波에몃해를 흔들리며
푸른 그대黑髮, 古神의面影,
水神의姿態야말로이갓더라.
옛날기리시야의자랑,
옛날로-마의榮華.
저편, 光明의窓에기대서
서계신이야말로 神의御像.
손가운대瑪瑙의燭불을잡으신
사이게의女神이어, 詩人의
거룩한나라로부터오신. ＜53＞
貧民의死

						(보-드레-ㄹ 作)
죽엄이야말로우리를 慰勞한다,
아아!죽엄이야말로우리를 살린다,
이야말로生의目的, 唯一한希望,
越粟幾失兒와가티 우리의말을놉히고, 醉하게하야,
내날의나종지勇進할勇氣를 준다.

暴風雨의밤에나 霜雪의아츰에나,
죽엄은우리들의어두운天邊에戰戰하는光輝,
옛書冊에쓰인. 高名한旅宿, -
우리들의것을먹고 쉬고잘수잇다.

죽엄이야말로天使, 그魔力잇는 손가운대가진것은,
졸음과, 法悅의, 의贈物,
貧寒하고아모것도업는사람들의寂床을 새롭게한다.
죽엄이야말로神의자랑, 神秘한庫間
貧人의財囊 저들의옛故鄕
이야말로 不知의天國의 열리는大迴廊-
咀呪의女人들

						(보-드레-ㄹ 作)
『너희들을, 내魂은地獄지 하왓스나
나는愛隣한다, 「아아나의悲慘한姊妹들.
너희들의慾望은사러지기어렵고
너희들의苦痛은 입으로말할수업다,
그리고 너희들의偉大한 마음은神聖한사랑의骨壺!』
