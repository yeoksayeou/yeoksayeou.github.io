◇Literature of the Proletariat (無産者의文藝)
Now indeed, all movements in literature are attempting to escape from the slavish tradition (奴隷的傳統) of the past and become a literature that expresses the self in a true sense (眞正한意味). This movement is primarily initiated by writers living in a proletarian mood (無産者的 氣分).

The literature of the proletariat first departs from self-affirmation (自己肯定), departs from the affirmation of the will to live (意志). That is, the action of trying to completely separate the self that wants to live from the slavish mentality (奴隷의 根性) becomes, of itself, a negation of the environment (環境) and is expressed as struggle (爭鬪).

In the literature of the proletariat, there is no life of intense sensuality (强烈한 官能), nor is there the playful enjoyment (遊戱的享樂) of lust (愛慾). All that exists is merely the emotion (感情) seeking to express itself frankly (率直히), merely the will (意志) filled with the spirit of struggle (爭鬪), merely the feeling of the leap (飛躍) of the whole life (全生命). However, in reality (現實), the leap of the whole life is always blocked (阻止); from this, fearsome resistance (反抗) bursts forth (排發). In short, the literature of the proletariat is a literature permeated by a spirit of resistance (反抗的精神). <28>

**Summary**

This article advocates for "Proletarian Literature," a new literary movement emerging from writers identifying with the proletariat. It argues this literature breaks from past "slavish traditions" by starting with self-affirmation and the will to live. This involves rejecting submissiveness and engaging in a struggle against oppressive environments. Proletarian literature eschews sensual or hedonistic themes, focusing instead on the frank expression of emotion, the will to fight, and the vitality of life. Because this vitality is constantly suppressed by reality, the literature is fundamentally characterized by a spirit of resistance. From a historical perspective, this 1922 article is significant as an early articulation of class-conscious literary theory in colonial Korea. It reflects the growing influence of socialist and nationalist ideas focused on challenging oppression (both colonial and class-based) and asserting a new, resistant identity through culture. Historians would find it valuable for understanding the intellectual currents and the beginnings of ideologically driven art movements during this period.

◇無産者의文藝
이제야말로 모든 文藝上의 運動도 從來의 奴隷的傳統으로부터 脫出하야 眞正한意味에서 自己를 表現하는文藝가 되려한다. 이運動은 主로 無産者的 氣分에 사는作家에依하야 勃發된다.
無産者의文藝는 먼저自己肯定으로부터 出發한다 살고저하는意志의 肯定으로부터 出發한다. 即살고저하는 自己를 完全히奴隷의 根性으로부터 어노코저하는 行動은 스스로環境에 對한否定이되며 는爭鬪되어 表現되는것이다.
無産者의 文藝에는 무슨强烈한 官能의 生活도 업스며 愛慾의遊戱的享樂도업다. 다못잇는 것은 率直히 表現하려는 感情이다, 爭鬪의氣分에充滿된 意志이다, 全生命의飛躍을感하는것이다. 그런데 現實에 잇서는 全生命의의飛躍이 언제던지阻止된다, 이에서 무서운反抗은排發된다. 要컨대 無産者의文藝는 反抗的精神으로一貫되는文藝이다. ＜28＞
