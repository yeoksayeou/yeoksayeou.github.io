Hamlet
						Shakespeare (Original Work), Hyŏn Ch'ŏl (Translation/Adaptation)
Act IV
Scene 6
Another room in the castle.
(Enter Horatio and a Servant)
Hor. Who is the person who wants to meet me?
Serv. It is a sailor. He says he has brought a letter.
Hor. Tell him to come in here…
(Servant exits)
There is no one in any part of the world who would send news to me. Unless it is His Highness Hamlet.
(Enter Sailor)
Sailor. Greetings.
Hor. Have you been well too?
Sailor. Thank you kindly. I have brought a letter here. It is a letter sent from the envoy who was departing for England.
Hor. (Reads)
‘Horatio, my friend. After you see this letter, please have this group gain an audience with the King. They have a letter to deliver to the King. Not even three full days had passed after setting out to sea when a band of extremely fierce pirates attacked us. Discovering that our mast was slower, we unavoidably encouraged our courage and engaged them in battle.<57> Thus, I ended up leaping onto the pirate ship. At this time, the two ships had already distanced themselves from each other. Therefore, alone and helpless, I was captured. However, the pirates treating me like a righteous thief (義賊) seems likely because they intend to make use of me later. Deliver my letter to the King, and then, my friend, I ask you to come to me with all the speed fit for death. There is astonishing news that will make you gasp when you hear it, but there is no small suspicion that it is too light for the duty undertaken. I trust these good fellows will guide you well to me. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, those two, have gone to England. The stories about them are limitlessly held in my heart. Farewell.
Your childhood friend (竹馬之友), Hamlet’
Come now. Let us find a way to deliver the petition (䟽狀) you brought to His Majesty. If possible, let's finish the task quickly and ask for guidance to the person who sent this letter.

Scene 7
Another room in the castle.
(Enter the King and Laertes)
King. There should be nothing more for you to doubt me about. Then, you must now trust me as a loyal friend. If you listen closely to the beginning and end of the matter, you will surely understand that the one who murdered your esteemed father was also after my own life.
Laer. Indeed, that could be said. But for what reason did you not take appropriate measures against such actions—against wicked deeds filled with sin and concerning life itself? When one's own life is at stake, using all one's wisdom (知慧), it is an outrage that cannot be left alone before any other matter.
King. Ah. There are two reasons for that. You might not think those reasons so important, but to me, they are very powerful. Firstly, the Queen, his mother, cannot bear not seeing his face, and besides, for me… whether virtue or vice, it doesn't matter, the Queen is like a rope binding my mind and body (心身); just as a star cannot leave its constellation (星座), I too cannot be separated from the Queen for even a moment. The second motive for not being able to discuss his public crime (公共的罪過) is that the general foolish populace (一般愚民) trusts and loves (信愛) him. If I were to soak his fault (過失) in the affection (愛情) of such foolish people, just as a magic spring (靈泉) turns wood to stone, his grave sin (重罪) would transform into a virtue (美德). And so, the arrow aimed clumsily for punishment might be blown back by the headwind (逆風) of public opinion (世論) and strike me instead.
Laer. Then have I helplessly (屬絶業시) lost my esteemed father, and had my only sister fall into the madness (狂症) of despair? Rather, if one were to praise (稱讚) it, where could one find a woman lacking nothing, without peer (匹敵) throughout past and present? I will surely avenge this enemy.
King. Do not worry about such things. You surely do not think of me as such a blusterer (虛氣者) who gets excited by danger akin to fire catching the beard (鬚髯)? Let us speak of this again soon. Just as my feelings for your late father are sincere (懇切), I also think of myself (自身). Please keep that in mind.
(Enter a courtier with a petition)
What is it?
Courtier. It is a petition (上䟽) sent from His Highness Hamlet. This is for Your Majesty, this is for the Queen.
King. From Hamlet? Who brought it?
Courtier. They say it was someone like a boatman (船人). Your humble subject (小臣) did not meet him, but received it from Claudio, who said he received it from the person who brought it.
King. Laertes, let me see it. ………… You may leave.
(Courtier exits)
(Reads)
‘To the most high and august King, Your Majesty, I offer this letter with a hundred bows. I report (奏達) that I have returned naked to this land. Tomorrow morning, I wish to behold the royal face (天顔) at close range (咫尺), and if you would grant (許賜) my humble wish (賤願), relying on (歸依) your generous (寬大) and compassionate heart (慈悲心), I shall report again the full details (顚末) of my abrupt (唐突) return to the country (歸國).
Hamlet’
What is the reason (낡) for this? Have the others all returned too? Or is this just utter nonsense?
Laer. Can you not make out the handwriting (筆蹟)?
King. It is certainly Hamlet’s handwriting. 『Naked』<59>……… with the gloss (改漆?) and it says 『alone』. What is your opinion (意見)?
Laer. I cannot understand the reason at all. But his return is what I desired. Hearing those words gives me a hundred times more courage (勇氣) than I had. I shall confront (面對) the Prince and question (詰問) him about the facts.
King. Laertes, if his return is indeed true (適實), however he managed to return—anyhow (何如間), since he has returned, will you follow my intentions for all follow-up measures (善後策)?
Laer. I will follow. As long as there is no loss (損失) to a warrior's (武士) honor (名譽).
King. It is because I wish to make name and reality (名實) complete. If he has lost heart and returned midway (中途) and has no intention of crossing again, I intend to persuade him and test (試驗) that plan (計劃) I devised earlier. When he loses his life because of it, no one will speak ill (惡評), and even his mother will not know it was a stratagem (計略), thinking it an unexpected accident (不意之變).
Laer. In that case, your humble servant (小官) will follow your honored intentions. If you entrust (擔當) that task to me, it is even more what I desire.
King. That is what I wish as well. Since your travels abroad (外遊), there have been various topics of conversation about you. Especially regarding that one skill at which you are said to excel the most, your name became even more renowned in Hamlet's presence. Even if all your skills were gathered, Hamlet did not envy them as much as that one. In my eyes, it seems rather insignificant compared to your other skills…
Laer. What skill might that be?
King. It is no more than a young man's hat ribbon (帽子), yet it is also an indispensable item. Just as black clothing (黑色衣服), focused on soundness (健全) and dignity (品位), is suitable (適合) for the old, light (輕快) and lively (活潑) clothing suits the young. Two months ago, Norman knights (노루만데이騎士) came here. I saw them myself and fought with them, and though I know the French (佛蘭西) are skilled (巧妙) in horsemanship (馬術), these warriors (武士) possessed among them a new supernatural power (新通力). Sticking to the saddle, appearing and disappearing like magic (神出鬼沒), while moving as one (合體) with their swift horses (駿馬), distinguishing between human and beast (人獸) seemed impossible; no matter how much I imagined (想像), I could not grasp<60> their actual state (實狀).
Laer. Were they Normans (놀루만)?
King. They were Normans.
Laer. Then it was probably Lamond (라몬드).
King. That's right.
Laer. I know him well. He is truly a pride of that country.
King. That man took off his helmet strap (투구) and went away boasting of your superb skill (妙技). He said that among the self-defense arts (護身術) you have trained (鍜鍊), especially when it comes to dagger and sword skills (小刀劒術), if there were anyone who could stand against (對敵) you, that would truly be something to see. He also practically swore an oath (盟誓) that French swordsmen (佛蘭西劒客) couldn't even think of advancing or retreating (進退), guarding (守衛), or their focus (着眼) if you just flashed (뻔듯거리기만하면) your blade. This talk gave Hamlet the greatest stimulus (剌戟) of envy, and he seemed very eager for an opportunity (機會) for your quick return (歸國) so he could have a match (試合) with you. So now, with this………….
Laer. Because of that connection (因緣)?
King. Laertes, are your thoughts of your father truly sincere (懇切)? Or are the tears only for others to see, while your heart and chest are elsewhere?
Laer. For what reason (緣故) do you say such words?
King. I am not saying you lack filial piety in remembering your esteemed father, but aren't we ourselves hearing and seeing (聞見) that all people begin at a certain time (時機) and at another time burn vigorously (旺盛) like flames? Among the burning flames of love, does not something like a dark, unburnt wick (燈心) arise? Nothing remains good for long; because even good, if prolonged, perishes along the way it passes. What one intends to do should be done immediately at the time of thinking. Otherwise, that intended action undergoes various changes (變化), transforming through tongue, mouth, hand, deed, changing (變遷) as things do in the world. Sometimes, what one intends to do is like a profligate's (放蕩者) sigh, merely a moment's relief, but in the end (畢竟), it brings harm (害) even to oneself. However that may be, regarding the matter (一件) of Hamlet's return, what plan do you have to uphold the duty (道理) of a son? Speak, don't just talk. <61>
Laer. I will cut off the Prince's head in the middle of the church (敎會堂).
King. Truly, no sacred place (靈塲) would cover up a great sinner (大罪人) of murder (殺人). Revenge (復讐) knows no boundary (境界). But Laertes, if you plot this revenge, stay inside your house for a while and do not come out. When Hamlet returns, let him know you have returned, deliberately send people to praise (稱頌) your superior (優秀) skill (技量), add a second coat of paint (漆) to what the Frenchmen said, and in the end, let both sides (雙方) agree to a match by wager. He, being an honest fool (바보의正直者) who wouldn't dream of a trick (計略), won't sharpen (가다듬지) his blade. Then you can easily, with a small deception (속임), avenge your father's enemy (怨讐) as planned.
Laer. I will do as you dispose. And according to that plan, I have something to apply to my blade. An oil-medicine (기름藥) I bought long ago from an apothecary (香具師); if this poison is applied once to the sword tip, even if just a small scratch (흠집) is made, life will certainly be lost. Even the power of marvelous preparation (調製妙骨) with all the magic herbs (靈草) under the moon (月下) cannot save him. I will apply this poison to my sword tip. Then, even if only a light scratch occurs, it will be easy to snatch away (앗기가) his life.
King. Let us think deeper and deliberate further (深思熟慮) on this, striving (旋力) for the opportune timing (時機) and convenient means (手段) to achieve (達成) our goal (目的). If this matter should fail (破綻) and such a stratagem be revealed (들어날것가트면), it would be right to stop from the beginning. Therefore, this plan must have a second means prepared in case the first fails. Wait……… Let me add some other means there……… Right, I've thought of it. During the heat (熱) of the match, when winning and losing, it is certain (定한일) they will get hot and thirsty……… no, it will surely happen……… deliberately challenge fiercely (激烈하게挑戰)……… then he will definitely ask for some kind of drink (飮料). At that time, I will have prepared a wine cup (酒盃), and if I make him drink it, even if he avoids (免할지언정) the poisoned blade (毒刃), he will not be able to avoid (避치못할것이다) the aim (견줌) here. ……… Who comes!
(Enter the Queen in panic (惶徨히))
Queen. Misfortune (不幸) follows misfortune on heels. ……… Laertes<62>ya, your sister has drowned (저죽었다) in the water.
Laer. What!! Drowned! Where!!
Queen. Where a slanting willow tree (버터나무) mirrors its leaf-backs (葉背) like glass (琉璃) in the small stream (적은내가), with daisies (雛菊), nettles (尋麻), buttercups (毛莨)……… which farmers vainly (空然히) call lewd (淫亂하다고), but pure (淸淨한) maidens (處女) call dead men’s fingers……… holding a garland (花環) woven with orchids (芝蘭) in her hand, driven by her mad longing (憧憬), she went to hang it on the drooping willow branch, but the heartless (無情한) branch broke, and flowers and body fell (어저) together into the water. At first, caught by her clothes (衣裳), she floated up (올라서) like a mermaid (人魚), perhaps unaware of her own misfortune, or like someone who originally (本來) lived in the water, she sang a few lines (몃마듸) of a song, but that too did not last long, and finally (듸디어) her clothes, soaked (먹음어) with water, dragged down (쓰을려서) by the weight, sank beneath the water along with her song.
Laer. Ah! Then my sister drowned.
Queen. Drowned, drowned she is.
Laer. Poor sister, you must have swallowed much water. I try not to shed tears (흘리랴고하지아니한다). But this is habit (버릇). I cannot bear (견듸지못한다) not letting the tears come out. Laugh if you will. Custom (習慣) cannot be helped by human power (人力). Once this passes, this weak nature (弱한性質) will also end. I withdraw (물러갑니다), Your Majesty. There are words burning like fire (烈火), but they will disappear in this foolish thing (愚鈍한物件).
(Laertes exits weeping)
King. Come, let us follow him. Gertrude, I don't know how much effort it took to calm down (鎭靜) his anger. I am concerned (念慮) this incident might cause it to recur (再發). Let us follow him.
(King and Queen exit)
……(End of Act IV)……<63>

**Summary**

Act IV, Scene 6 sees Horatio receive a letter from Hamlet, delivered by sailors. Hamlet explains he was captured by pirates after leaping onto their ship during an attack, treated surprisingly well, and is now returning alone to Denmark, while Rosencrantz and Guildenstern continue to England. He asks Horatio to facilitate the sailors' audience with the King and then join him quickly. Scene 7 depicts King Claudius confirming Laertes' trust by explaining why he didn't publicly punish Hamlet for Polonius' death: the Queen's devotion to Hamlet and Hamlet's popularity with the masses. News arrives via letter confirming Hamlet's sudden return. Claudius and Laertes then plot Hamlet's murder through a fencing match, where Laertes will use a poisoned, unblunted sword, with a backup plan of a poisoned drink offered by Claudius. The Queen interrupts with the news of Ophelia's drowning.

From a historical perspective, this 1922 Korean translation of *Hamlet* in *Kaebyŏk* magazine is significant. It demonstrates the early engagement of Korean intellectuals with canonical Western literature during the Japanese colonial period, using it perhaps as a means of cultural enlightenment or subtle resistance. The translation itself, by "Hyŏn Ch'ŏl," using a mix of Hanja and Hangul with older spellings (like `닭`, `가티`, `잇습니다`, `업다`, `버터나무`), reflects the linguistic transition happening at the time and provides valuable data for studying the development of the modern Korean language and translation practices under colonial rule. Historians might find the choice of *Hamlet* (with themes of usurpation, revenge, madness, and political intrigue) potentially resonant, though presented here seemingly as a straightforward literary translation.

國王. 이우에는더나를 疑心할것이업지 그러면인제는나를 信友로밋지 아니하면 아니되겟지 일의前後를 仔細히들으면 君의父君을殺害한者가나의목숨지 엿본것인줄 알수가잇겟지.

臣下. 船人가튼이라고하옵니다. 小臣은 맛나뵈옵지못하고 크로데이오의손에서 바닷사오나 그는가저온사람으로 부터서 바든것이라고 하옵니다.
國王. 레에야치이쓰, 어대보아보자. …………물러가거라
(臣下退去)
(읽는다)
『至高至嚴한國王陛下 삼가百拜로 이글을올리나이다. 臣이赤身으로 이邦土에돌아오게된것을奏達하옵내다. 來日아츰에는天顔을咫尺에밧들어 萬一賤願을許賜하실것가트시면 寬大하신慈悲心에 歸依하여唐突이歸國한顚末을다시奏達하옵겟습니다
하믈레트』
이게어쪈낡인가. 다른사람들도다돌아왓는지엉터리도업는 거짓말이나아닌지?
레에. 筆蹟을斟酌하시지못하십니.
國王. 確實한 하믈레트의筆蹟은筆蹟이다. 『赤身으＜59＞로』………의改漆한것과『혼자』라고써잇다. 자네의意見에는.?
레에. 도모지 닭을모르겟습니다. 그러나돌아온것은 바라든바이올시다. 그말을들으니 업든勇氣가百倍나더납니다. 王子面對하여 事實을詰問할것이올시다.
國王. 레에야치이쓰야 萬一에歸國이適實하거든 어케하여歸國을하엿는저 何如間歸國을하엿슨즉 모든善後策을. 나의대로 조츨터인가?
레에. 좃겟습니다. 萬一에武士의名譽에損失만업스면.
國王. 名實을完全히하자고하기문이다. 제가마음을잡지못하고中途에서돌아와 다시건너갈마음이업스면 내가 저를 타일러서 일즉이計劃해둔 그일을試驗코자한다. 제가글로因하여 목숨이업서지는에는 아무도하나 惡評할사람이업고 現在에제어머니되는사람도 計略인줄은모르고 不意之主變인줄알것이다.
레에. 그럴것가트면 小官도尊意를 좃겟습니다. 萬一그일을小官으로하여곰 擔當케하시면 더욱이 바라는 바이올시다.
國王. 그것은나도願하는바이다. 君은外遊以來로 여러가지로 말거리가된일도잇섯다. 그것이 하믈레트面前에서 네가第一잘한다는 그한가지재조에對해서는 더욱이 이름이놉핫다. 君의모든재조를 다모아노터래도 그것한가지만치하믈레트가 부러워하지는아니하엿다. 나의눈으로볼것가트면 그것은 君의다른재조에比하면 하잘것업는것가티 생각이드는것인데…
레에. 그재조라고하는것이 무엇인가요.
國王. 젊은사람의 帽子에지나지아니하는것이다 한업지못할物件이다. 늙어지면 健全과品位를 主旨로한 黑色衣服이 適合한것과가티 젊은사람에게는 輕快하고活潑한衣服이맛는것이다. 두달前에 여긔에 노루만데이騎士들이왓다. 나는親이보기도하고 싸워도보왓지만佛蘭西사람들의馬術에巧妙한것도 알지마는이武士들에게는 그中에新通力을가지고잇섯다. 안장에들어부터서神出鬼沒하게 돌아단이면서도駿馬와合體가되어 人獸姓을分揀한것가티 아모리 想像을하여도 하는수업시＜60＞그實狀에는 미칠수가업섯다.
레에. 놀루만사람이엇습니?
國王. 놀루만사람이엇섯다.
레에. 그러면 아마 라몬드이엇지요.
國王. 그러타.
레에. 그사람이면 저도잘압니다. 그사람이야말로 그나라의 한자랑거리입니다.
國王. 그사람이 투구을 러노코 君의妙技를 자랑하고갓다. 君이護身術을 鍜鍊한가운대로 特히 小刀劒術에 이르러서는 그대를 對敵해낼사람이잇기만하면 그야말로 볼만한것이라고하엿고, 佛蘭西劒客들은 그대가 뻔듯거리기만하면 進退라든지 守衛라든지 着眼이라고하는것을 엄두도낼수가업다고 盟誓하다십히하엿스니. 이말이第一하믈레트를 부러웁게剌戟을주어서 어하엿든지 君이 急히 歸國할機會가잇서서 한번試合하여보기를 매우바라는 모양이다. 그러니 只今이것을 가지고………….
레에. 그것으로因緣하여서?
國王. 레에야아치쓰 정말로 아버지 생각이 懇切한가? 그러치아니하면 눈물은 남보는대이고 마음과 가슴은판인가?
레에. 무슨緣故로 그러한 말슴을?
國王. 父君을思慕하는 孝心이君에게업다고하지는아니하지마는 모든사람이라고하는것은 어한時機에始作되고 어한時機에는불가티旺盛함은 우리들의親히聞見하는바이아닌가. 타올르는사랑의 불가운대는 타지아니하는어두운燈心가튼것이 생기지아니하는가 모든物件은 오랫동안 善이라고하는것이업다웨그러냐하면 善도오래지면 지내는그길로 亡하는것이다. 하랴고생각하는일은 생각할그에곳할것이다. 그러치아니하면 생각한 그일이 여러가지로 變化를 해서 혀로 입으로 손으로 일로 世上에잇는대로 變遷해가는것이다. 어한는 하랴고하는것도 放蕩者의 한숨과가티 한에安心할거리이요 畢竟은그몸에지害가되는것이다. 그런것은어되엇든지하믈레트가歸國한一件은 그대로하여금 어한計劃으로써 남의子息된道理를 지키랴고하는가?말만말고. ＜61＞
레에. 敎會堂의복판에서 王子의목을버여어털이겟습니다.
國王. 정말이지 如何한靈塲이라도 殺人의大罪人을덥허두지는아니할터이지 復讐에는아모턴境界가업는것이다. 그러나 레에야아치이쓰야이復讐를 하거던 얼마동안 집에들어 나오지말아라. 하물레트가 돌아오거던 자네가歸國하엿다고알려주고 일부러 사람을보내여자네의優秀한技量을 稱頌케하여 佛蘭西사람들이 한말에 두 번거덥漆을올려서 結局은雙方이다 내기로試合을하게하자. 計略인줄은에도 생각지못하는 바보의正直者니 칼날은가다듬지아니하겟지. 그리고보면 容易하게족으마한속임으로써 計略과가티 父君의怨讐를 갑흘것이다.
레에. 處分대로하겟습니다. 그리고 그計略대로하는대로 臣의칼에발를 物件이잇습니다. 일즉香具師에게서 사서둔기름藥, 이藥을한번 칼에발르기만하면 족으마한 흠집만 생겨도 반듯이 목숨이 업서집니다. 月下에모든靈草로調製名骨의힘이라도 救해낼수가업습니다臣은이藥을 칼에발르겟습니다. 그리고보면비록가벼운 흠집이생기드래도 목숨을앗기가쉽겟지요.
國王. 이우에도 더욱이深思熟慮하여 우리들의目的을達하도록 時機와手段의便宜를 旋力해보자萬一에이일이破綻퇴어서 이러한計略이들어날것가트면 차라리처음부터 그만두는것이올흔일이다. 그럼으로 이計劃에는 처음手段이失敗하드래도 第二의手段을고치지아니하면 아니될것이다. 가만히잇서………거긔다 무슨手段을좀더너허야지………을치생각햇다. 試合을한참하여 이겻다 젓다할그는몸에熱이나고목이마를 것은定한일일것이니………아니그럴것이야………일부러激烈하게挑戰을하게………그리면반듯이 제가무엇이든지 飮料를 求할것이다 그에 나는酒盃를 準備하여두엇다가 그것을먹이면 毒刃을免할지언정여긔서 견줌은避치못할것이다. ………누가오나!
(王妃惶徨히들어온다)
王妃. 발굽을잇단不幸과不幸. ………레에야치이쓰＜62＞야 그대의누이동생이 물에저죽었다.
레에. 무어요!!저서!어대서요!!
王妃. 휘어져 것드린 버터나무가 엽등(葉背)을琉璃가티비치운 적은내가에, 雛菊, 尋麻 毛莨………空然히農夫들은 淫亂하다고부르지마는淸淨한處女들은 죽은사람의 손가락이라고부르고잇는………芝蘭의곳으로 맨든花環을손에다들고 미처서憧憬하는그마음으로 느러진 버들가지에 걸러갓다가 無情한버들가지부러지는 그틈에 과몸이한가지 물에어저 처음에는衣裳에걸려서 人魚와기티올라서 自己의不幸을알지못함인지 本來부터 물에서 사는사람과가티 노래를 몃마듸 부르드니 그것도오래가지못하고 듸디어 衣服이물울먹음어 그무게에쓰을려서 노래와한가지물밋헤가란고마랏다.
레에. 아아! 그러면 누이가 저죽엇나.
王妃. 저죽엇다 저죽은것이다.
레에. 불상한누의야 너는물을만히먹엇겟지 나는눈물을 흘리랴고하지아니한다. 그러나이것이버릇이다. 눈물이아니나오고는 견듸지못한다. 웃으랴거든웃어라 習慣은人力으로 어케하는수가업다. 이것이다지내버리면 弱한性質도다하고말겟지, 물러갑니다陛下. 烈火로라오르는文句는잇지마는 이愚鈍한物件에사라지고말겟지.
(레에야치쓰울며들어간다)
國王. 자아우리는 저뒤를 하가자 카아쪽으루으드그성냄을鎭靜시키기에 얼마나힘이들엇는지모른다. 이내이일로因하여 再發이될는지도念慮이다. 우리들은하가보자.
