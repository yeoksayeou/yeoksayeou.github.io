Sacrificed While Working Away from Home in Niigata Prefecture /〓Searching for the Bereaved Family of Our Compatriot

						From Ki Ch'an in Miryang

Dear X. When I was leaving, you had something to say about whether things would stay as they were or if there would be a move. How have things turned out these days? Since leaving Seoul once and heading south, I've moved almost morning and evening—to Masan, then Tongnae, Tongnae to Pusan, Pusan to Miryang—but nowhere have I found anything refreshing. The sight of young people withering and falling, the sight of foreign tribes prospering arrogantly, is even more severe when witnessing the actual conditions south of Seoul than when treading any other soil in Chosŏn. Among these, the appearance of the collapsing farming villages and the gaunt forms of the old men and young children, as if mourning the fate of those villagers, are truly unbearable to look at directly.

Dear X. Still, we—or rather, the many writers, talkers, thinkers, and schemers similar to us—whenever we gather, we chatter day and night about the construction of a new culture, the securing of the right to live, and what not. But what can be done? The vast majority of our compatriots, even before they can comprehend terms like 'new culture' or 'right to live,' are already being trampled by those who trample, and destroyed by those who destroy.

X. Thinking like this, there is no end to what I could say. Let's leave everything for when we meet face-to-face, and here I will only tell the story of searching for the bereaved family of our compatriot—Mr. Pak Chin-yŏl—who was sacrificed while working away from home in Niigata Prefecture. But Brother, I write this letter crying. If possible, please read this letter crying as well.

X. As you know, my reason for coming to the Kyŏngnam region this time was solely to seek out the farming villages of this area, one after another, and to dig into the circumstances of some dreadful facts, whether open or hidden, within them. However, this is not something that can be accomplished in the short period of a week or two. It is something that cannot be done unless one investigates continuously for at least several years. With this in mind first, on the 11th, I visited a village called "Mŏngaesil," about ten *ri* from Miryang Town, a village of only one hundred sixty households <100> which had sent out over seventy laborers to Japan. On the following day, the 12th, I visited a village called Mich'on, about thirty *ri* from Miryang Town. This village is where the home family of Mr. Pak Chin-yŏl is located—the one said to have been abused at the Shin'etsu Electric Power Company's construction site in Niigata Prefecture, and whose manner of death is unknown, whether he drowned, starved, or was murdered by those wicked fellows.

X. Accompanied by a fine young man from Miryang Town, I left Miryang Castle's east gate at 2 PM on the 12th. After crossing the river three times, we arrived at Mich'on at 5:30 PM. At the village schoolhouse (書堂), we asked a boy wearing a *kangkŏn* (headband) and *kwan* (hat) for directions and the two of us stopped by the house of Mr. Pak Sŏng-yŏl, the elder brother of the late Mr. Pak Chin-yŏl. However, the master of the house, Mr. Pak, happened to be away in Miryang Town on business, and his son, a young gentleman, received us. When we stated the purpose of our visit and asked about the circumstances surrounding it, an old man wearing a *kat* (traditional hat) and *turumagi* (overcoat) and a middle-aged man just returning from the fields came. This middle-aged man was Pak Su-yŏl, who said that he had escaped from the Shin'etsu construction site in Niigata Prefecture together with his cousin Chin-yŏl, entered the mountains, became lost, and on the sixth day, his older cousin Chin-yŏl starved to death in the Iwagwan mountains, while he alone barely managed to return alive. Indeed, the shadow of starvation had not yet faded from his face. The appearance at that time, shown in a separate photograph, is still quite visible. As if saying, "This is truly a chance to fully express my burning feelings," he recounted the entire story from beginning to end for over an hour. Summarizing his account: "Lured by the sweet words and deceitful tricks of a Japanese man named Uehara, I, along with my cousin Chin-yŏl and about eighty other companions, left Pusan and arrived at the construction site in Niigata Prefecture after four days and nights last spring, on the 29th day of the 3rd lunar month. How could we not be utterly disappointed? In the contract signed at the time of recruitment, the working hours of eight hours suddenly changed to fifteen hours, the mention of using electric machinery changed to digging mountains and quarrying stone, and the actual daily income of one *wŏn* and ten *chŏn* changed to less than seventy *chŏn*. Furthermore, fearing potential escapes, they confined us in gloomy prison cells at night, and even on payday at the end of each month, we couldn't see a single penny (they forced us to save, saying we would run away if given money). Around the main gate of the site, dozens of bicycle patrols were conducted to watch all movement outside, and if unfortunately caught by those fellows' eyes, one would be sent to the criminal affairs staff within that group, stabbed with knives, and hung upside down. No matter how I thought about it, it felt like being dead rather than alive. Moreover, my cousin Chin-yŏl, being someone who had originally <101> never done such tough work, became increasingly gaunt day by day. Whenever we met, he would talk about our hometown and leak his intention to do something like this. Thus, at twilight on the 4th day of the 6th lunar month, we brothers risked our lives in a desperate gamble and escaped that dreadful den of a construction site. Thinking only that we would be killed if caught by those fellows' eyes, we just kept crawling deeper into the trackless mountains, trying only to avoid them.
Ah, what is this? We spent that night, and went through the entire next day, but the end of the mountain was nowhere in sight; it was just bamboo forests and miscellaneous trees. Looking ahead was vast emptiness, and looking back was the same. On the fifth day of this, we barely discovered a small house in a mountain valley, but when my cousin looked at the doorplate, he said it was the house of an employee of the Shin'etsu Company. Even in our state of utter exhaustion, our hearts leaped at the mention of that company, and we again fled into the mountains, taking a completely unknown path, just thinking that if we could get far away from those fellows' workplace, we might survive. But what could we do? On the morning of the seventh day, my cousin first sank down beside a rock, saying, 'I can't go any further now. There's nothing left but to die! You are still better off than me, so if by some luck you can preserve your life, go back and at least deliver the news of this shameful death to our relatives in our hometown.' How do you think my heart felt upon hearing these words?

'Brother—' I just sank down right there. I hadn't realized it until then, but once I sat down, my body, soaked by the deep mountain dew all night, began to tremble violently. No matter how I tried to endure it, my chin kept quivering uncontrollably, and I couldn't do anything about it. At this time, my cousin embraced my trembling body <102> and just kept saying, 'You must live. You must live.' The morning sun rises. It shone warmly through the trees onto the bodies of us brothers. My whole body felt like it was melting. My cousin gently released his embrace on me and just collapsed. Suddenly, I had a strange feeling and called out 'Brother, Brother' repeatedly, but alas, there was no answer anymore. His eye sockets took on an unusually blue hue, and I don't know where they gathered from, but bluebottle flies came buzzing around. Even in such a trackless deep mountain, those kinds of things exist. I had no thoughts. After letting out a sigh, I don't know what happened to me. Feeling my body was extremely hot, I came to my senses and saw my cousin's corpse lying there as it was. The slanting evening sun shone warmly down on my body, and suddenly my mind seemed to clear. 'I have no choice but to find a way to live,' I thought. Covering my cousin's cold body with a couple of types of wood, I headed towards the valley visible below. With the determination to survive until death, sometimes lying down, sometimes getting up, sometimes walking, sometimes stopping, by fortune or misfortune, on the third day after leaving my cousin, I found a mountain cottage and barely managed to survive thanks to the aid of the house's owner. I found out later that this was the very house my cousin and I had found earlier. Several days later, accompanied by police officers from the Nagano Prefectural Police Station, which had jurisdiction over the area, we searched for my cousin's body for three days and three nights, but ultimately failed to achieve our goal, and I have returned alone like this." He seemed to regret, even now, not being able to die together with his brother.

Dear X. Where else in this world could there be such a sad fact, and who else could <103> be in such a heartbreaking situation? Ah, Brother, whose fault is this ultimately? It must be the fault of being born Korean, and among Koreans, the fault of being born without money.

Dear X. The facts are grave, but this letter is becoming too long. I will add a few more words about Mr. Chin-yŏl and then close.
The Mr. Pak Chin-yŏl in question (36 years old this year) had studied Chinese classics early on but had achieved little. Consequently, he became a person who couldn't do either writing or work satisfactorily. He already had a family, having a daughter and a son. As his son had already reached the age of eleven, he worried day and night about the boy's education and supporting his family. However, there was no farmland available for tenant farming there, and although his elder brother had a house, it was also not prosperous. As a last resort, he planned to go to Japan, and that is how things turned out, they say.

X. I spent the night there as dusk fell, listening to the circumstances of the farming village throughout the night with the brothers of that village. Early the next day, while leaving the village, I encountered Mr. Sŏng-yŏl, Chin-yŏl's elder brother, who was returning from the town. Being the elder brother of the deceased, he was very moved and grateful to meet me, but suddenly he began to weep, emphatically stating that even though it was the account of his cousin Su-yŏl, there were inevitably points of doubt, and that the cause of his younger brother's death was surely not that simple. He insisted there must be an inside story, but the means to investigate were vague. He considered the so-called correspondence from the deceased mentioned in a certain newspaper article to be stranger than anything. I merely recorded the words from this side and that side truthfully, and being in a hurry to return to my company (office), I promptly left that place and came to Miryang Town. Now, I will add an excerpt from a personal letter sent by the late Mr. Chin-yŏl to his elder brother upon his initial arrival in Japan, and then lay down my pen.

(Previous part omitted) Your younger brother, while away from home, is managing to sleep and eat for now. Leaving Pusan on the 26th of last month, I arrived safely in Niigata Prefecture, Japan, after four days and nights. The distance is over six thousand *ri*. Arriving in a foreign country for the first time, the blue mountains and flowing waters are like those of my homeland, but thinking of home, I cannot settle my melancholy feelings. Nevertheless, I have no choice but to work here for some months or years and return after obtaining even a few tens of *wŏn*. Please understand this, and I hope that you, brother, will take care of the family affairs in any way possible. There is more to say, but the paper is short, so I cannot write everything. (Latter part omitted).<104>

**Summary**

The article, written as a letter by Ki Ch'an from Miryang, details his search for the family of Pak Chin-yŏl, a Korean man who died while working in Niigata Prefecture, Japan. The author interviews Pak Chin-yŏl's cousin, Pak Su-yŏl, who escaped with him from harsh forced labor conditions at the Shin'etsu Electric Power Company. Su-yŏl recounts their harrowing escape, Chin-yŏl's death from starvation in the mountains, and his own rescue. The article highlights the exploitative contract terms, brutal treatment, and confinement faced by Korean laborers. Chin-yŏl's older brother expresses suspicion about the official cause of death. The piece concludes with an excerpt from Chin-yŏl's letter home, revealing his hope to earn money for his family. For historians, this article provides a poignant first-hand account of the deceptive recruitment practices, horrific conditions of forced labor endured by Koreans in Japan during the colonial period, and the desperation driving impoverished farmers to seek work abroad. It starkly illustrates the human cost of Japanese industrial projects and colonial exploitation, as well as the grief and suspicion left behind for the families.

X兄. 密陽邑內에 잇는 好個의 靑年 한 사람과 携手同伴하야 密陽城東을 나기는 十二日의 午後二時, 세차레나 江을 건느어 美村에 到着하기는 同五時半이 엇습니다 村中書堂에 綱巾쓰고 冠쓴 少年에게 집을 무러 우리두사람은 故朴珍烈氏의 親兄이 되시는 朴性烈氏의 宅에 들럿습니다. 그런데 그 宅主人 朴氏는 마츰 密陽邑內로 作容하고 그의 令子되는 少年어른 한분이 우리를 對하더이다. 來意를 告하고 이에 對한 先後의 事情을 물은 즉 갓쓰고 두루막입은 老人한 분과 일터으로 막돌아오는 -壯年한 분이왓습니다. 이 壯年한 분이 自己의 從兄되는 珍烈과 한가지로 新澙縣의 信越工場을 脫走하야 入山迷惑第六日에 그 兄珍烈은 岩管山속에서 餓死하고 自己 혼자가 艱辛히 生還하엿다는 朴壽烈이란 사람이외다. 그러니말어지 그의 顔面에는 오히려 饑餓의 陰影이 가시지아니하엿나이다. 別個의 寫眞에 나타난 當時의 貌習이 만히 그래도보입니다. 그는 『이린이야말로 가슴타는 所懷를 說盡할 機會이다』하는 듯이 一時間以上을 亘하야 그의 間自初至終을 이약이하엿습니다. 其略에 가르되『日本人上原某의 甘言, 詭計에 誘惑되어 兄珍烈을 爲始한 八十餘名의 동무와가티 釜山을 나 晝夜四日에 新澙縣工場에 到着하기는 客春의 陰三月二十九日이엇습니다. 어失望千萬아니할수가잇습니 募集當時의 契約書中, 勞働時間 八時間은 十五時間으로 電力機械使用云云은 鑿山採石으로, 實收每日一圓十錢은 七十錢未滿으로 突變되며 中에도 萬一의 脫走를 慮하야 저녁에는 陰沈한 監房에 拘束하고 每月末日의 計算日이되어도 돈은 한푼도 求景할수가 업고(돈을 주면다라난다하야 强制로 貯金함) 工場의 正門周園에는 數十人의 自轉車巡廻를 行케 하야 一切의 外出을 看守하다가 不幸히 그놈들의 눈에 걸리면 그 組內의 刑事部員에게로 廻送되어 칼로리우고 각구루매여달리우는 바 아모리생각하여도 죽은 것갓지 살은 것갓지 아니한 中 더욱 從兄珍烈은 本是억세인일을 해보＜101＞지못한 어른이라 形容은 날로 槁枯하야 對하기만하면 故鄕의 넷이약이를 말슴하시며 如此如此할 意를 漏洩함으로 陰六月四日黃昏에 우리 兄弟는 九死의 一生을 期하고 그무서운 暗窟의 工場을 脫走하야 그놈들의 눈에 들키면 죽이울것만 생각하고 그놈들만 避하노라고 人迹업는 山中으로 그냥그냥 기어올라갓습니다.
아아 이것이 무슨일입니 그밤을 세워가고 그이튼날의 終日을 가도 그 山의 이 보이지아니하고 그냥 竹林이오 그냥 雜木이외다 내다보아도 漠然하고 돌아다보아도 그턱이외다 이러하기 第五日에 艱辛히 山間의 작은 집하나를 發見하엿스나 兄님이그 門牌를 보시더니 信越會社員某의 집이라합니다 우리는 氣盡脉盡한 그 中에도 그놈의 會社 무엇이라는 것에 가슴이하여 다시 山으로 山으로 암모르는 길을 가다라낫습니다 그저그놈들의 일터와멀어만지면 살아날것과가타서요. 그러나어합니 이리하기 第七日되던 아츰에 兄님이먼저바위겨테주저안지시며「이제는 더갈수는 업다 죽는 수밧게는 업다! 너는 그래도 나보다는 나흔 便이니 幸혀라도 목숨만 保全하여나아가 故鄕의 親戚들에게 이 面目업는 죽음의 消息이라도 傳하라」합니다 이말슴을 들은 저의 마음이 어하엿겟습니
山中에 餓死하엿다는 朴珍烈

「兄님-」하고 그대로 주저안젓습니다 여태지는 모르겟더니 안고나니 밤새도록의 깁흔 山이슬에 저즌몸이 덜덜 리가를 始作하며 아모리 참고저하여도 턱춤이자 추어저서 어 할 수가 업섯나이다 이에 兄님은 리는 저의 몸을 그대로안으시며 다못＜102＞「너는 살어야한다 너는 살어야한다」합니다 아츰 해가 니다 그 나무와 나무 사이를 通하야 수하게 저의 兄弟의 몸우를 비추엇나이다 온몸이녹은 하여지며 兄님이슬며시안앗든저를 노코 그만 쓸어저눕습니다 저는 별안간 異常한 생각이 들어서「兄님 兄님」을 連呼하엿스나 아아 다시는 對答이 업소이다 눈자위가 異常히 푸른빗을 우더니 어대서들 모여드는지 푸른파리들이 왕왕 날아듭니다 그와가튼 人迹업는 深山에도 그위의 것은 잇습디다 저는 아모 생각이 업섯습니다 한숨한번지운 以後의 저는 어된지를 모르나이다 몸이 甚히거운듯함으로 精神을 채려본즉 兄님의 屍體는 그대로노혀잇는데 기울여진 夕陽이 하게 이몸을 내려쪼여 문득 精神이 灑落해지는듯합니다「左右間살 道理를 해보는수밧게업느니라」하고 두어가지의 나무로써 兄님의 찬몸을 덥고 저는그미테보이는 골을 向하야 죽기지의 決心으로써 或臥或起且步且止하야 幸가 不幸가 兄님을 난지 第三日만에 山家의 한집을 차저 그집 主人의 救護로 이 命을 苟存 하엿습니다 그 後에 알고보니 그집이 即처음 兄님과가티차자갓던 집이외다 그 後幾日에 그곳 管轄인 長野縣警察署의 巡査들과 가티 三日三夜를 亘하야 兄님의 屍體를 차젓스나 畢竟 目的을 未達하고 저혼자 이러케 와잇습니다」하는그는 自己의 兄님과가티 죽지못한것을 只今지 悔恨하더이다.
山中에 救助되던 朴壽烈

X兄님. 世上天地에 이와가티슯흔 事實이 다시어대잇스며 이와가티 氣막히는 境遇가 다시 누구에게＜103＞잇슬것이겟습니, 아아 兄님, 이것이 大體누구의 탓이겟습니, 朝鮮 사람된탓이며 朝鮮 사람에도 돈업는사람된 탓이겟지오.
X兄님. 事實은 重大하오나 片紙로는 넘우길어집니다 珍烈氏에 對한 이약이 두어마디를 더 告하고 아조 을 막겟습니다.
問題의 朴珍烈氏(今年三十六歲)는 일즉이 漢學을 工夫하엿스나 別로 成就함이 업고 하서 글도 일도 다가티시원히하지못한사람되인 中에 이미 室家를 두어 女一人, 子一人을 得하야 그 子息된 이가 벌서 十一歲가 되엇슴에 그 子에게 對한 敎育과 家族에 對한 扶養을 爲하야 晝宵焦慮하나 그곳에는 小作할 田土도 업스며 實兄의 家가 有하나 한 豊裕치 못하매 最後의 一計로 日本行을 作하야 그리된 것이라 합니다.
X兄님, 저는그곳에서 날이 저물어 그곳에서 一泊하며 밤새도록 그 村中의 兄弟와 가티 農村의 形便을 듯다가 그이튼날 일즉이 그 村을 나는 途中에서 邑으로 부터 돌아오는 珍烈氏의 實兄되는 性烈氏를 逢着하얏나이다. 그는 死者의 實兄이 되는 그만큼 저를 對하며 넘우 欣感하더니 문득느울며 아모리 從弟인
烈의 말에 일지라도 疑訝가 不無한 事와 實弟의 死因이 암만하여도 그와 가티 單純치 아니한 것을 力說하며 그 間에는 반듯이 內幕이 잇슬지나 調査할길이 漠然하다하며
某紙에 나타난 新澙縣記事中 所謂死者의 通信이란 것을 무엇보다도 異常하게 생각하더이다. 저는 다못이 便저 便의 말슴을 事實대로만 記錄하여가지고 歸社할 길이 急하야 문득 그곳을 난 密陽邑으로 왓나이다. 이제 故珍烈氏로부터 日本에 初到하면서 그 家兄에게 送한 親信書의 一節을 附記하고 붓을 노켓나이다.
