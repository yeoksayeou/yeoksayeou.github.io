**Summary**

This editor's postscript from the October 1922 issue of *Kaebyŏk* magazine announces the recent official approval (granted September 12th) to include political and economic news, a change requested the previous December. However, the current issue maintains the old format, with the new content promised for the November issue. It also notes the conclusion of No Chŏng-il's serialized travelogue and details several staff changes, including resignations and new appointments, along with recent business trips taken by department heads. From a historical perspective, the granting of permission to publish political and economic content is significant, hinting at the tight censorship under Japanese colonial rule and the magazine's attempt to broaden its scope within those constraints. The staff movements, particularly the departure of the Acting President due to duties at the Ch'ŏndogyo Church Monthly Report Company, underscore the close ties between the magazine and the Ch'ŏndogyo religious movement, a key element in Korean nationalism during this period.
