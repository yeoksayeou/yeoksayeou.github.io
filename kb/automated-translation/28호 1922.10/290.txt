Sun and Moon (Our Folktale)
						Chu Yosŏp, in Shanghai

Once upon a time, in a mountain village in our country, lived a very lonely widow. Beneath the vast sky, amidst the dense mountains, in a small stone-and-mud hut built when her husband was alive, she spent her quiet days with her twelve-year-old son and nine-year-old daughter. Behind the house, on a hill, old zelkova trees that pierced the sky formed a natural windbreak. From beyond that hill, a clear, not-so-wide stream flowed in front of the house, curved around to the left past a mound of ashes, circled around again, and disappeared far, far away, singing a lovely song. Crossing a narrow path that wound through young pine trees growing on the left hill, stepping over a plank bridge laid across a narrow stream, and then climbing over a high pass where old, large pine trees stood tall, making fearsome sounds, one traversed a short distance through wide, wide millet and sorghum fields to reach a large village.
In that village, there was a candy shop that our children loved most, a tavern that drunkards loved, and also the mill where this widow reported daily.
Every morning, in the dim dawn before sunrise, a single stream of white and black smoke would rise from the low chimney of the lonely stone-and-mud hut, sometimes mingling with the morning mist and rising to the sky, sometimes crawling along the ground. Then, the brother and sister would rub their sleepy eyes and get up, wash their faces with the warm water their mother had heated, and the three would sit together and eat their meager but tasty breakfast. Then, as soon as the sun rose in the eastern sky, the mother, to earn money to live, would go to the village mill beyond the pass, only returning when dusk fell in the evening. Thus, during this lonely <22> whole day, the brother and sister would watch the house by themselves. They played hide-and-seek and house, gathered shepherd's purse, water parsley, and wild greens in spring, dipped their feet in the shallow, misty stream and told scary old tales in summer, climbed the tall elm trees by the riverbank in autumn trying to catch the cicadas crying mournfully, and in winter, huddled under blankets in the cold room, the brother twisting straw ropes and the sister sewing, waiting for their mother, saying, "Tedious day, hurry and pass." After sharing the cold leftover rice lunch their mother left, being children, they would clutch their hungry stomachs and gaze only at the pine-covered ridge. Then, at dusk when the day was nearly dark, their mother would hurry along the mountain path, carrying two bowls of rice obtained for the evening meal. Then the brother and sister, forgetting all sadness, all hardship, all fear, would shout "Mother!" and run out. The sister would cling to their mother's stained skirt, acting childishly, while the brother would take the rice bowls from their mother and carry them into the house. Then the three would share the still-warm rice brought from the mill, and afterwards, placing the castor oil lamp in the center, the mother would tell stories of the village, and the children would tell of their day, mixing laughter and tears. When the children took off their clothes first and got into bed, the mother, struggling to thread a needle with her dim eyes, would tell them many, many old tales that we love to hear.
As the tired children, hearing their mother's affectionate voice as if in a dream, slowly drifted off to sleep, the mother, not realizing they were asleep and continuing the old tale alone, would notice they were asleep, smile softly, stop her work, give the children warm kisses, and then continue mending the children's jackets and darning their socks until almost dawn.
In this way, though their life was poor, it passed joyfully and interestingly, day by day.
However, one late spring evening, the brother and sister gathered an armful of wildflowers and waited eagerly for their mother. But for some reason, even after the sun set in the western sky and the day grew dark, their mother did not return. So the children, feeling anxious and scared, lit a lamp in the room, locked the door, and sat there, close to tears.
On the high ridge that lay between this house and the village, <23> an old white tiger had lived for a long time, catching and eating many village pigs and dogs. People were also often injured by it and frequently frightened. So, while it was fine during the day, even the strong Mansu's father wouldn't dare travel there alone on a dark night.
On this day, the mother, being too busy, worked late. By the time she got her evening rice and started for home, it was already pitch dark. The mother certainly knew that walking the mountain path at such a time was extremely dangerous, and the village women had strongly advised her to sleep anywhere and go the next morning after sunrise. But a mother's heart, thinking of her children going hungry all evening and crying through the night in the scary mountain house, forgot all danger and fear. She headed straight home, but sure enough, she ended up becoming food for that tiger.
This greedy tiger, having devoured the mother leaving only her bones, crept stealthily towards the mountain house, intending to eat the innocent children waiting for their mother as well.
The brother and sister clutched their hungry stomachs and cried for a while, then the brother suddenly lifted his head, pricked up his ears, listened intently, and said,
"Hey, sister, I hear someone's footsteps outside," gently shaking his sister who was sobbing, her back heaving slightly. The sister also lifted her head, wiped her tears with her fists, and listened carefully. It really sounded like footsteps. So she said,
"Oh my, Mother must be here," and went to open the door. But the cautious brother said, "Hey, wait! Let's make sure who it is before opening the door," and stopped her.
A little later, someone outside tugged at the door.
"Hey, children, open the door! It's me," said a hoarse voice from outside. The children, hearing such a strange voice for the first time, asked together,
"Who is it?"
"Children, who else could it be? It's your mother," answered the voice from outside, but since the voice wasn't the familiar voice of their mother, they said again,
"Our mother's voice isn't like that." <24>
"Oh dear, I ate too many crabs at the mill today, so my voice changed."
"Then let's see your hand, is it like our mother's hand?"
Outside, the tiger thrust its front paw through a tear in the paper window.
"Oh my goodness! This isn't our mother's hand!"
"My hand is rough because I worked hard."
"Then why is there so much fur on it?"
"That's not fur. It's because so many crabs climbed on me."
But the brother was still suspicious, so he wet his finger with saliva, poked a hole in the window paper, and secretly peeked out.
Oh! This was terrible. Standing outside wasn't their mother, but a huge white tiger. But the quick-witted brother came up with a plan.
"The door is shut too tight, we can't open it. Come in through the kitchen. There's a bowl on the shelf; put the rice in there and bring it in."
The tiger was pleased and went into the kitchen. Once inside, to deceive the children, it clattered the rice bowl noisily. During that time, the brother quickly took his sister, opened the door, and escaped outside, but there was nowhere to go.
The moon hung high in the sky, bright as day, but they were in the deep mountains, secluded and quiet, and the tiger's jaws sought to devour these two small bodies. What would become of these pitiful children?
For a while, they hesitated, looking around in all directions, but there was absolutely nowhere to go. So, quickly, as a temporary measure, they scrambled up the old tree by the river where they used to climb and play every summer. They climbed nimbly and sat clinging to a branch where new leaves were sprouting greenly, trembling uncontrollably.
The tiger, after clattering around in the kitchen for a while, thinking of eating humans and licking its chops (), came into the room saying,
"Children, let's eat!" But there was no one in the room. The dim castor oil lamp flickered mockingly, dancing about. The tiger, dumbfounded, angry, and disappointed, rushed outside and ran around searching everywhere for the children, but ultimately couldn't find them. <25>
Having run around for a long time, sweating and thirsty, the tiger went to the riverbank to drink water. As it lowered its head to drink, deep, deep in the water, weren't the brother and sister sitting on something? It was their reflection, of course. But the tiger found it very strange.
"Hey children, how did you get in there, get in there?" it asked in the voice of a drunken old man.
The girl, being naturally talkative, found the sight of the huge tiger squatting awkwardly asking "How did you get in there, in there?" so funny that she couldn't help but giggle,
"Hee hee."
At that, the tiger heard the laughter, quickly lifted its head, and looked up at the tree.
"Oh, so you're up there! How did you climb this tree?" it asked. The brother replied,
"We coated the tree with sesame oil (챙기름) and climbed up." Hearing this, the tiger chuckled "Heung heung," pleased, and quickly ran into the kitchen, brought out a whole jar of sesame oil, and poured it all over the tree trunk. Then it tried to climb, scrambling with its front and back legs, but with oil smeared on the tree, how slippery must it have been? It would climb a little and slip down, climb a little and slip down.
Because of this, the tiger's bottom hurt so much that it gave up trying to climb and again called out pleadingly, "Children, please tell me the truth now, how did you get up there?"
This time too, it would have been better if she had kept quiet, but the talkative sister blurted out,
"We chopped steps with an axe (독기), one step, two steps, and climbed up." Hearing this, the tiger thought, "That's right, wonderful!" and hurried back into the kitchen, grabbed a small axe that was leaning behind the water jar, came out, and, just as the sister had said, began chopping steps one by one, *thump thump* (), huffing and puffing as it started to climb.
The brother was aghast, blaming and resenting his sister's talkativeness, but what could be done about something already past? Sighing, he looked down; the greedy white tiger had already climbed almost halfway up the tree. He looked up; the sky was vast, the stars twinkled, only empty space. He looked around; only his sister sat clinging to a branch, trembling and wiping her tears. <26> Now, it seemed they were inevitably doomed to die without a trace. The brother, initially panicked and unsure what to do, thought that at times like this, the only recourse was to appeal to the Heavenly Lord (한우님). He comforted his crying sister, and together they prayed earnestly to the Heavenly Lord. They prayed together:
"Oh, Heavenly Lord! If you mean to save us, send down a hemp rope, and if you mean to kill us, send down a rotten straw rope." What a strange and wondrous thing! As soon as they finished their prayer, from the high heavens above, a long rope came dangling down.
In that perilous instant when the tiger's front paw was about to reach the children, they had already grasped the strong heavenly rope and were floating high up into the sky.
The dumbfounded tiger stared blankly at the children ascending. When their figures disappeared behind the clouds, the tiger mimicked the children and prayed like this:
"Oh, Heavenly Lord? If you mean to save me, send down a hemp rope, and if you mean to kill me, send down a rotten straw rope."
Again, a long rope descended from heaven. The tiger, seeing this, was so overjoyed that it jumped up before the rope even touched its front paws, grabbed it, and clung on. But everyone, this time the rope was not a real hemp rope, but a rotten straw rope. With that heavy tiger hanging onto a decaying, fragile rotten rope, could it possibly hold? The straw rope snapped with a *tuk*, and the tiger fell straight down, its belly burst, its limbs torn apart, dying instantly.
Everyone, everyone, even now, if you go out into the fields and walk through a sorghum field, see how every sorghum stalk is stained with crimson blood? That is the blood shed when the tiger fell into the sorghum field and died back then, spreading through the field and staining every stalk with blood, which is why they remain stained with blood even today.
But anyway, what became of the brother and sister who ascended to heaven? Do you know? Have you perhaps heard? Can you perhaps guess?
The two went up to heaven and played happily for some time in the vast courtyard of the Heavenly Lord. Of course, they also met their mother there, who had been caught and eaten by the tiger, and they hugged and cried and kissed. For some time, they passed the days joyfully, joyfully, unaware of the passage of time. <27>
One day, the Heavenly Lord, whose white beard flowed down to his chest, called the brother and sister and spoke thus:
"Your mother is already old and worked much on earth, so now, to rest a bit, I have had her enter the palace in yonder peaceful courtyard. You two are still young and haven't worked, so you must start working now. Therefore, young man, you become the sun, and young lady, you become the moon. The sun shall shine upon the whole world by day, and the moon by night. Now, suddenly, the sun and moon have both died, and the people of the world are making a fuss, saying they will die of darkness. Hurry and prepare. You will meet your mother once a day during your rest time, so do not be sad. Your duty is simply this: each day, take turns walking slowly from the eastern sky to the western sky."
Therefore, from that day on, it is said that this brother became the sun and the sister became the moon. However, a few days later, the sister complained that she was scared to walk the path at night and pestered her brother to switch roles. Finally, obtaining the Heavenly Lord's permission, the sister became the sun and the brother became the moon, and they continue to circle like that every day even now. ...(End)

**Summary**

This article retells the classic Korean folktale "The Sun and the Moon," about a brother and sister whose widowed mother is eaten by a tiger. The tiger then impersonates the mother to try and trick the children, but they see through the disguise and escape up a tree. They pray to the Heavenly Lord (Hanunim) and are lifted to heaven by a strong rope, while the pursuing tiger asks for a rope too but receives a rotten one and falls to its death, staining sorghum fields with its blood. In heaven, the siblings are reunited with their mother and appointed by the Heavenly Lord to become the moon and sun, eventually swapping roles because the sister found the night scary. From a historical perspective, the publication of this traditional Korean folktale ("uri Tonghwa" - Our Folktale) by a prominent writer like Chu Yosŏp in *Kaebyŏk*, a leading nationalist magazine in 1922, is significant. It represents an assertion of Korean cultural identity and tradition during the Japanese colonial period, subtly reinforcing national narratives and values (like faith in Hanunim) in the face of external pressures. The author's location noted as Shanghai also hints at the broader context of the Korean independence movement based there.

이도  가만히잇섯스면 조흘 것을 입새업는누의가
『독기로한발자국 두발자국 찍고올라왓다』하고 대주엇습니다. 이말을들은 범이란놈이 올타 조타쿠나하고 급히 부엌으로돌우들어가서 물독뒤에기대여두엇든 작은독기를 들고나와 누의애가 말한대로 한발자국 두발자국 찍어내리고 씩씩하면서 올라오기를 시작햇습니다.
오래비는 긔가막히여서 누의의 입새업슴을 책망도하고 원망도하엿스나 이미지나간일이라할수잇습니? 한숨을쉬이며 나려다보니 나무를 벌서 거의절반이나 올라온 욕심만흔 백호범이요 올려다보니 한울은창창 별은조롱조롱 허공이요 돌아다보니 나무지에걸쳐 무서워며눈물씻는 누의가잇슬따＜26＞름이니 이제는 할수업시 감쪽가티 죽을수밧게 업시생겻습니다. 오라비도처음에는 창황망조하야 어할줄을몰라돌아가다가 이런는 한우님 청을대는수밧게업다구 생각하고 우는 누의를 달래어가지고 둘이서 정성을 다하야 한우님 긔도를 올렷습니다. 둘이서 긔도하기를
『한우님이어! 우리를 살리려거든 삼노을 나려보내시고 우리를 죽이시랴거든 썩은색기오래기를 나려보내주옵소서』세상에 이상야릇한일도잇지 그들이 긔도를 마치자마자 저-편닥이 한울우으로부터 기-다란노하나이 주렁주렁나려왓습니다.
범의 압발이 벌서 아이들몸을 침로하려구하는 그위험한 한초동안에 아이들은벌서 그튼튼한한울노을타고 한울놉히둥둥올라갓습니다.
기가막힌 범이란놈, 아이들의 올라가는양을물그럼히바라보다가 아이들의 모양이 구름사이에 가리워서 보이지아니할 범도 아이들숭내를 내여서 이러케 긔도하엿습니다.
『한우님이어? 나를 살리랴거든 삼노을 나려보내시고 나를 죽이시랴거든 썩은색기오래기를 나려보내주시옵소서.』
다시 한울에서 기-다란줄이 달아 나려왓습니다. 범이란놈이 이것을보고 넘우도깃븐김에 줄이, 채압발에닷기도전에 올라어서 줄을잡고 매여달렷습니다. 그러나 여러분 이번줄은 정말노이아니고 썩어진색기줄이엇습니다. 다-허저가는썩은줄에 그무거운범이매여달렷스니 견디여나겟습니? 색기줄이툭하고 허지더니 범이란놈이 그만어저서배가터지고 사지가어저서 즉사하엿습니다.
여러분 여러분이 지금도 들에나가 수수밧을거마하여보시오 수수대ㅅ마다 싯벌건피가 무덧지오 그것은 곳 그범이 수수밧에어저죽으면서 흘린피가수수밧에편만하야 대대마다 피물을들엿섯슴으로 오늘지도 그러케 피가무더잇는것이외다.
그러나 하여간에 한울로올라간 오누이는 그후어케되었는지 여러분은 아십니?혹들으셧습니?혹짐작하실수잇습니?
둘이서는 한울로올라가 얼마동안넓다란 한우님에서 즐겁게잘놀앗습니다. 물론 범한테 잡히어 먹히운어머님도 거긔서만나서 붓잡고 울고 입마췃습니다. 그들은 얼마동안을 세월가는줄도모르고매＜27＞일매일 질겁게 질겁게 지나갓습니다.
하로날은 허-연수염이 가슴지 늘어진한우님이 오누이를 불러 이러케말햇습니다.
『너의어머니는 이미 나히늙어서 우에서도 일을만히하엿스니 지금은 좀쉬기위하야 저편안 궁전에들어가 계시게하엿다. 너의들은아즉도 어려서일을아니하엿스니 지금부터일을좀하여야하겟다. 그러니 총각너는 해가되고 처녀너는 달이되어서 해는낫에 달은밤에 온세상을비춰주어라. 이제갑작이 해와달이 다죽어서 지금은 세상사람들이 어두어죽겟다구 야단들을친다. 어서속히준비하여라. 너의어머니는 하로한번식쉬일마다 맛나불터이니 설어말아라. 너의들의할 직분은 그저 매일매일 서로번갈아서 동편한울로부터 서편한울로 천천히거러가는 것이다.』
그럼으로 그날부터 이 오누이는 오라비는해 누이는 달이되엇다구합니다. 그러나 그후며칠후에 누의가 밤에길것기가무섭다구 오라비더러직분을바자고 졸라서 마츰내 한우님의 허락을어더 누이가 해 오라비가 달이되어 지금지 그냥 매일빙빙돌아간답니다. ……()
