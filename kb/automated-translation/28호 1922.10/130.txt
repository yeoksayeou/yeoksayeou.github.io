Sacrificed While Working Away From Home in Niigata Prefecture / Searching for the Bereaved Family of the Fellow Countryman

From Kijŏn in Miryang

Dear X, at the time I left, you mentioned something about moving as things were. How have things been these days? Since leaving Seoul once and heading south, I have moved almost morning and evening, from Masan to Tongnae, Tongnae to Pusan, Pusan to Miryang, but nowhere do I find anything refreshing. The sight of young intellectuals withering and collapsing, the sight of foreign tribes living brazenly—these are even more severe when witnessing the actual conditions south of Seoul than when treading any other land in Chosŏn. Among these, the state of the utterly collapsing farming villages and the gaunt figures of the old men and young children, as if mourning the fate of those villagers, are truly unbearable to look at directly.

Dear X. Still, we—or rather, the many writers, speakers, thinkers, and schemers, more or less similar to us—whenever we gather, we chatter day and night about the construction of a new culture, the securing of the right to survive, and whatnot. But what can be done? The vast majority of our fellow countrymen, even before they can comprehend terms like 'new culture' or 'right to survive,' are already trampled by those who trample and destroyed by those who destroy.

X. Thinking this way, there is no end to what I could say. Let's leave everything for when we meet face to face. Here, I will only tell the story of searching for the bereaved family of our fellow countryman, Mr. Pak Chin-yŏl, who was sacrificed while working away from home in Niigata Prefecture. By the way, X, I write this letter weeping. If you can, please also read this letter weeping.

X. As you know, my coming to the Kyŏngnam Province this time was solely for the purpose of seeking out the farming villages of this region, one after another, and digging into the circumstances of some terrifying facts, revealed or hidden, within them. However, this is not something that can be accomplished in a short period of one or two weeks. It is something that cannot be done without at least several years of continuous investigation. With this preliminary thought, on the 11th, I visited a village called "Mŏngaesil," about ten *ri* from Miryang town, a village of only one hundred sixty households <100> that had sent out over seventy laborers to Japan. On the following day, the 12th, I visited a village called Mich'on, about thirty *ri* from Miryang town. This village is where the main house of Mr. Pak Chin-yŏl is located—the man who, it is said, was exploited at the factory of the Shin'etsu Electric Power Company in Niigata Prefecture, and whose manner of death is unknown, whether he drowned, starved, or was murdered by those wicked men.

X. Accompanied by a fine young man from Miryang town, I left the east gate of Miryang fortress at 2 PM on the 12th. After crossing the river three times, we arrived at Mich'on at 5:30 PM. At the village schoolhouse, we asked a boy wearing a *kangkŏn* (headband) and *kat* (traditional hat) for directions and visited the house of Mr. Pak Sŏng-yŏl, the elder brother of the late Mr. Pak Chin-yŏl. However, the master of the house, Mr. Pak, happened to be away working in Miryang town, and his son, a young gentleman, received us. After explaining our purpose and asking about the circumstances surrounding the matter, an old man wearing a *kat* and *turumagi* (overcoat) and a middle-aged man just returning from the fields arrived. This middle-aged man was Pak Su-yŏl, the one who, along with his cousin Chin-yŏl, escaped from the Shin'etsu factory in Niigata Prefecture. On the sixth day after getting lost in the mountains, his elder cousin Chin-yŏl starved to death in the Amgwan mountains, while he alone barely managed to survive and return. Indeed, the shadow of starvation had not yet faded from his face. The appearance from that time, shown in a separate photograph, is still largely visible. As if thinking, "This is truly the chance to fully express the heart-burning feelings," he recounted the entire story from beginning to end for over an hour. The gist of it is as follows: "Lured by the sweet words and deceitful tricks of a Japanese man named Uehara, I, along with my cousin Chin-yŏl and about eighty other companions, left Pusan. After four days and nights, we arrived at the factory in Niigata Prefecture on the 29th day of the third lunar month last spring. How could we not be utterly disappointed? In the contract from the time of recruitment, the working hours, stated as eight, suddenly changed to fifteen; the use of electric machinery mentioned turned into mountain quarrying; the actual daily wage of one Won and ten Chŏn became less than seventy Chŏn. Furthermore, fearing any possible escape attempts, they confined us in gloomy cells at night, and even on the calculation day at the end of each month, we couldn't see a single penny (they forced us to save, saying we would run away if given money). Around the main gate of the factory, dozens of bicycle patrols were conducted to watch over any outings. If unfortunately caught by those fellows' eyes, we were sent to the criminal affairs section within that group, where we were stabbed with knives and hung up tied with ropes. No matter how I thought about it, it felt more like death than life. Moreover, my cousin Chin-yŏl, being someone who had never done strenuous work <101>, grew more gaunt day by day. Whenever we met, he would speak of stories of home and revealed his intention to do this and that. Thus, at dusk on the fourth day of the sixth lunar month, we brothers risked our lives, expecting one chance of survival out of nine deaths, and escaped that terrifying dark cave of a factory. Thinking only that we would be killed if caught by those fellows' eyes, we crawled further and further into the trackless mountains, just trying to avoid them.
Ah, what is this? We spent the night, and even after walking the entire next day, we couldn't see the end of the mountain; it was just bamboo forests and mixed woods. Looking ahead, it was vast and indistinct; looking back, it was the same. On the fifth day of this, we barely found a small house in the mountains, but when my cousin looked at the doorplate, it said it was the house of someone from the Shin'etsu Company. Even in our state of utter exhaustion, our hearts leaped at the mention of 'that company,' and we again fled into the mountains, following an unknown path. We felt that if we could just get far from those fellows' workplace, we might survive. But what could we do? On the morning of the seventh day, my cousin first sank down beside a rock, saying, 'I can't go any further now. There's nothing left but to die! You are still better off than me. If you are fortunate, preserve your life, go back, and at least convey the news of this shameful death to our relatives back home.' How must my heart have felt upon hearing these words?

[Caption: Pak Chin-yŏl, who starved to death in the mountains]

'Brother—' I cried out and collapsed right there. I hadn't realized it until then, but once I sat down, my body, soaked by the deep mountain dew all night, began to tremble violently. No matter how hard I tried to endure it, my jaw kept chattering, and I couldn't help it. At that moment, my cousin embraced my trembling body tightly, merely <102> saying, 'You must live. You must live.' The morning sun rises. Through the spaces between the trees, it shone warmly upon us brothers' bodies. My whole body felt relaxed, and my cousin gently released his embrace and collapsed, lying down. Suddenly, a strange thought occurred to me, and I called out 'Brother! Brother!' repeatedly, but alas, there was no answer anymore. His eye sockets took on an unusually bluish tint, and I don't know where they came from, but blue flies gathered, buzzing loudly. Even in such a trackless deep mountain, things like that existed. I had no thoughts. After letting out a sigh, I don't know what happened to me. Feeling intensely hot, I gathered my senses and saw my cousin's corpse lying there as it was. The setting sun shone warmly down on my body, and suddenly my mind seemed to clear. 'One way or another, I have to find a way to survive,' I thought. Covering my cousin's cold body with a couple of types of wood, I headed towards the valley visible below. With the resolve to die trying, sometimes lying down, sometimes getting up, sometimes walking, sometimes stopping, fortunately or unfortunately, on the third day after leaving my cousin, I found a mountain cottage. Through the help of the owner of that house, I managed to barely preserve this life. Later, I found out that this house was the very one I had initially found with my cousin. A few days later, accompanied by police officers from the Nagano Prefectural Police Station, which had jurisdiction over the area, we searched for my cousin's body for three days and three nights, but ultimately failed to achieve our goal, and I have returned alone like this," he said, still regretting that he could not die together with his cousin.

[Caption: Pak Su-yŏl, who was rescued in the mountains]

Dear X. Where else in this world could there be such a sad reality, and who else could <103> possibly be in such a suffocating situation? Ah, X, whose fault is this, ultimately? Is it the fault of being a Chosŏn person, and among Chosŏn people, the fault of being poor?
X. The facts are grave, but this letter grows too long. I will add a few more words about Mr. Chin-yŏl and then conclude.
The Mr. Pak Chin-yŏl in question (36 years old this year) had studied Chinese classics early on but had not achieved much. Consequently, he was a person who could not do well in either studies or work. He already had a wife and had fathered one daughter and one son; his son was already eleven years old. For the sake of his son's education and the support of his family, he worried day and night, but there was no land available for tenant farming there. His elder brother's family, though present, was also not well-off. As a last resort, he decided to go to Japan, which led to this outcome.
X. The day grew dark there, so I stayed overnight, listening to the circumstances of the farming village throughout the night with the brothers of that village. Early the next day, while leaving the village, I encountered Mr. Sŏng-yŏl, Chin-yŏl's elder brother, returning from the town. Being the deceased's elder brother, he was overjoyed to see me, but then suddenly broke down crying. He emphasized that although it was the account of his cousin [Pak Su-]yŏl, there were bound to be doubts, and that the cause of his younger brother's death was surely not so simple. He insisted there must be an hidden story (內幕) behind it, but the means to investigate were unclear. He found the so-called correspondence from the deceased mentioned in a certain newspaper article particularly strange. I merely recorded the words from this side and that side truthfully and, being in a hurry to return to the company, promptly left that place and came to Miryang town. Now, I will attach a passage from a personal letter sent by the late Mr. Chin-yŏl to his elder brother upon his initial arrival in Japan and lay down my pen.
(Beginning omitted) Your younger brother is managing to eat and sleep for now in this foreign land. Leaving Pusan on the 26th of last month, after four days and nights, I arrived safely in Niigata Prefecture, Japan, a distance of over six thousand *ri*. Upon arriving in this foreign country for the first time, the blue mountains and flowing waters are like those of my homeland, but thinking of home, I cannot settle my melancholic heart. Nevertheless, I have no choice but to work here for some months or years and return after earning even just a few tens of Won. Please understand this and, by all means, I hope you, brother, will take care of the family affairs. There is more to say, but the paper is short, so I cannot write everything (Ending omitted). <104>

**Summary**

This article, written as a letter by Kijŏn from Miryang, recounts the tragic story of Pak Chin-yŏl, a Korean man who died while working as a laborer in Niigata, Japan, in 1922. Lured by false promises of good wages and conditions by a Japanese recruiter, Pak Chin-yŏl and others found themselves subjected to brutal exploitation, long hours, virtual imprisonment, and withheld wages at the Shin'etsu Electric Power Company. Pak Chin-yŏl and his cousin, Pak Su-yŏl, attempted a desperate escape into the mountains, during which Chin-yŏl starved to death. The author interviews the surviving cousin and the victim's elder brother, conveying their grief and suspicions about the official account of death, highlighting the powerlessness and suffering of Korean laborers under Japanese colonial rule. For historians, this article provides a poignant first-hand account illustrating the deceptive recruitment practices targeting impoverished Koreans, the horrific conditions faced by migrant laborers in Japan, the desperation leading to escape attempts, and the difficulty families faced in ascertaining the truth about loved ones' fates, reflecting the broader socio-economic hardships and colonial exploitation during that period. The personal letter fragment adds a layer of pathos, showing the initial hopes juxtaposed with the grim reality.

問題의 朴珍烈氏(今年三十六歲)는 일즉이 漢學을 工夫하엿스나 別로 成就함이 업고 하서 글도 일도 다가티시원히하지못한사람되인 中에 이미 室家를 두어 女一人, 子一人을 得하야 그 子息된 이가 벌서 十一歲가 되엇슴에 그 子에게 對한 敎育과 家族에 對한 扶養을 爲하야 晝宵焦慮하나 그곳에는 小作할 田土도 업스며 實兄의 家가 有하나 한 豊裕치 못하매 最後의 一計로 日本行을 作하야 그리된 것이라 합니다.
X兄님, 저는그곳에서 날이 저물어 그곳에서 一泊하며 밤새도록 그 村中의 兄弟와 가티 農村의 形便을 듯다가 그이튼날 일즉이 그 村을 나는 途中에서 邑으로 부터 돌아오는 珍烈氏의 實兄되는 性烈氏를 逢着하얏나이다. 그는 死者의 實兄이 되는 그만큼 저를 對하며 넘우 欣感하더니 문득느울며 아모리 從弟인
烈의 말에 일지라도 疑訝가 不無한 事와 實弟의 死因이 암만하여도 그와 가티 單純치 아니한 것을 力說하며 그 間에는 반듯이 內幕이 잇슬지나 調査할길이 漠然하다하며
某紙에 나타난 新澙縣記事中 所謂死者의 通信이란 것을 무엇보다도 異常하게 생각하더이다. 저는 다못이 便저 便의 말슴을 事實대로만 記錄하여가지고 歸社할 길이 急하야 문득 그곳을 난 密陽邑으로 왓나이다. 이제 故珍烈氏로부터 日本에 初到하면서 그 家兄에게 送한 親信書의 一節을 附記하고 붓을 노켓나이다.
(前畧,) 舍弟客裡, 眠食姑保. 客月二十六日에 釜山을 나 晝夜四日에 無享히 日本新澙縣에 到着하니 里數가 六千餘里요 初到他國에 山靑水流는 故國과 가트나 집을 생각하니 鬱鬱 한 懷抱를 定치못하옵니다 然이나 不得已此處에서 歲月間動勞하야 幾十圓이라도 取得한 後에 還歸할 터오니 如此下諒하옵시고 아모조록하여도 兄님옵서 家事를 保護하여주옵기를 바라옵나이다 餘言長楮短不備日(下畧).＜104＞
