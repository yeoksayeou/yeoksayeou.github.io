A Dream is a Good Dream
That a certain wealthy aristocratic lord has recently been spending no small amount of money on educational projects, charity expenses, and other matters like commendations for filial piety and virtuous conduct is something everyone thinks of with gratitude. However, it is also a matter of question how the mind of that Lord, who was formerly known in Chosŏn as arguably second to none as a lover of money or a miser – the kind who, if a bluebottle fly didn't land on his soy sauce jars in May or June, would scoop up seed water and chase it all the way to the Namsan signal fire mound just to wash the soy sauce off its wings and feet – could have changed so much in the blink of an eye. Hearing about the motive for him now spending his money, it seems that one night last spring, the Lord had a dream where his late father (先大監) appeared vividly and asked him to go together. After having that dream, the Lord's mood was constantly unpleasant, and he thought to himself, "My late father asking me to go means that I will die before long. If I die without having ever properly used this vast fortune I've amassed during my life, I won't escape the derisive name of 'miser' (守錢奴) in the afterlife. It would be better to spend some on social projects while I'm alive." Having decided this, he reportedly began spending. If this is indeed true, then that Lord's dream was not a bad dream, but a good one. Had the Lord not had this dream, it is questionable whether he would have spent money like that, and consequently, it would have been difficult for him to gain some honor in his old age. We hope that the Lord dreams such dreams several times a month, and also that other wealthy people dream many dreams like this.

The Obstinate Botany Teacher
A botany teacher at a certain Higher Common School went for a walk in T'apdong Park with a Japanese teacher from the same school. At that time, in a corner of the park, cockscomb flowers (鷄冠花 - maendurami) were in full bloom. The Japanese teacher asked the botany teacher what this was called in Korean and how it was written in Chinese characters (Hanja). The botany teacher knew it was called 'maendurami' in Korean but did not know how to write it in Hanja. However, being a so-called botany professor, it was too embarrassing (昌皮) to admit he didn't know, so he forced an answer, saying it was "扇狀花" (Sŏnjanghwa - fan-shaped flower, because it looked like a fan). He then asked the Japanese teacher in return, who replied that in Japan, they write it as 鷄冠花 (Keikanka - cockscomb flower). Later, the teacher told this story to his students at school, saying something akin to a lecture: "In Japan, science has developed, so even the names of plants are all appropriately assigned. But in our Chosŏn, science has not yet developed, so there are no definite names for things, causing much difficulty (困難) for both teachers and students. Therefore, you gentlemen <97> must study diligently." That science has not yet developed in present-day Chosŏn, causing difficulties for teachers and students, is something everyone sympathizes with in the teacher's words. However, a noun like 鷄冠花 (Keikanka/Kyegwanhwa) is a term intrinsically used in Chosŏn from long ago, even if science hadn't developed. If that teacher, instead of graduating from a Higher Normal School in Japan, had gone to a pharmacy in Kurigae and read the *Yaksŏngga* (藥性歌 - Song of Medicinal Properties) even once, he wouldn't have had that difficulty. Still, calling a cockscomb flower 'Sŏnjanghwa' is perhaps slightly better than the Japanese girls' school teacher who answered that "democracy" (데모크래시) was a "poisonous drug" (毒藥). Heh heh…

The Permanently Returned Barbarism Doctor
Dr. Deguchi (出口博士), who insulted Koreans by calling them barbaric (野蠻) in connection with the Keijō Medical Specialty School skull disappearance incident, suffered from an extremely severe nervous illness (神經病), groaning in pain until medicine proved ineffective (無效), and last month finally became a guest of no return (不歸客). At that time, when general Korean society criticized and attacked Deguchi, the Bureau of Education Affairs (學務局) and the school principal's side explained that Deguchi did not mean it intentionally but had misspoke due to mental derangement (精神異狀) from his nervous illness. We only thought they were saying this to shield Deguchi, like saying "green is the same color" (草綠同色格 - birds of a feather flock together), but seeing that Deguchi has now passed away from a nervous illness, it seems it was indeed true that he had mental derangement at the time, and his words were merely those of a madman (狂者). However, the ancients said, "When a bird is about to die, its cry is mournful; when a man is about to die, his words are good" (鳥之將死其鳴也哀 人之將死其言也善). Seeing that Deguchi's words were wicked when he was near death, he cannot be called an ordinary human being. In any case, the Doctor has now become a guest of no return, and his skull (頭盖骨) will be buried under the desolate autumn rain on an empty mountain (蕭蕭한 空山秋雨). Where now is the madness (狂) of a lifetime? Someone should dissect his skull to see if it is indeed a civilized bone (文明骨) or a barbaric bone (野蠻骨).

The Inchworm Aristocrat
During the Korean Empire (韓國時代), a certain Minister (判書) of Namch'on Changdong was known for diligently seeking office and performing public duties when things were peaceful in the Royal Palace (宮中), feasting on his salary (祿), but at the slightest sign of difficulty (困難) in the Palace, he would feign illness and resign, knowing this as a clever stratagem (妙計) worthy of Zhuge Liang (諸葛亮). In severe cases, he once took office three times and resigned three times within a single month, leading contemporaries to mockingly call him "Tattered Hat Minister" (弊頭判書) or "Dog Penis Minister" (狗腎判書 - Kaejot P'ansŏ). Just as "no generation lacks worthy men" (何代無賢), there is now a certain aristocrat (貴族) who, whether initiated by Koreans or Japanese, takes on the title of president or advisor (顧問) by default for any association (會) or company (社) that bears the name, as if he has a monopoly franchise. It would be fine if he saw things through from beginning to end (有終有始), but like an inchworm (尺蠖) that retreats and stays still in one place like a dead twig when it encounters a harmful insect or bird while progressing, he initially participates in some association or company for his own status and reputation (名譽), but if there is no particular tangible benefit (實效), he severs the connection ambiguously <98> (有耶無耶間). In the desolate aristocratic society after the departure of the "Busybody Guest" (無事奔走客 - possibly referring to someone active but meddlesome), wearing a 'pŏrakkamto' (벌악감토 - an unknown term, possibly a type of hat or a metaphor for pretense) selling an empty name (空穀之名) and adding the nickname 'Inchworm' (尺蠖) to his titles might be considered colorful, but how about maintaining some dignity through self-respect and self-care (自重自愛)?

Not Forgetting One's Roots
The 16th day of the 7th lunar month (七月旣望) in the autumn of the Imsul year (壬戌之秋) is merely the day the Song Dynasty (宋時代) literary figure Su Dongpo (蘇東坡) went boating on the Chibi River (赤壁江). The *Red Cliff Rhapsody* (赤壁賦), which records his boating trip, certainly still has literary value (價値) today, but there is no need to commemorate the day he went out until today. However, because this year happens to be an Imsul year (壬戌年), people who know even a little bit of literary dregs (文字之糟粕), as if seizing a great opportunity (機會), vied to go boating on the 16th day of the 7th month. It even led to an unfortunate incident (不祥事) in Tongbok County (同福郡) where someone emulating (效) Dongpo's elegant pursuits (風流) became an "immortal riding a whale" (騎鯨仙人) like Li Bai (李白) [i.e., drowned]. This is not just a habit among us Koreans; Japanese people also have such customs. Even Mizuno (水野), the giant of the political world and Home Minister (內相), reveled wildly at the Kōyōkan (紅葉館) on the 16th, and Governor-General Saitō (齋藤總督) also went boating on the Han River (漢江). Regarding this, those who flatter the Governor-General say, "Previously, Governor-General Terauchi (寺內總督), being from the military faction (武斷派), engaged in horse riding or hunting even on holidays. But now Mr. Saitō, being from the cultural faction (文化派), goes boating or fishing on his days off." However, viewed impartially (公眼), Terauchi and Saitō are both the same. Why? Although Terauchi's horse riding and Saitō's boat riding differ between land (陸) and water (水), riding something is the same. And although Saitō's fishing and Terauchi's hunting have different targets (目的物), harming creatures is the same. Furthermore, Terauchi was an Army (陸軍) man, so his spirit was always on land (陸上). Mr. Saitō is a Navy (海軍) man, so "not forgetting his roots" (不忘其本), he plays on the water (水上) and fishes on the water. Extrapolating from this, Mr. Saitō's proclaimed "Cultural Policy" (文化政治) will likely amount to nothing more than such a difference.

The Evils of Abbreviation (畧字)
After the Japan-Korea Annexation (日韓合倂後), Japan changed Korea's (韓國) general systems (一般制度) and simultaneously altered even place names (地名) that were somewhat offensive to the eye: Han'guk became Chosŏn (朝鮮), Hansŏng (漢城) (or Hwangsŏng 皇城) became Kyŏngsŏng (京城), and Tong (洞) became Chō (町). At that time, the authorities (當局), to implement this, strove to promote it internally and externally through writing (文字) and speech (言論). Misunderstanding this, a certain Japanese person once sent a letter addressed to "Chosŏn Sang-nyong-dono" (朝鮮相龍殿) to Han Sang-nyong (韓相龍氏), the managing director (專務) of Hansŏng Bank (漢城銀行). Also, among Koreans opposing the annexation (合倂), there were even cases of boycotting (不買) Hanil Tobacco (韓日煙草) as a commemorative item of the annexation. Be that as it may, if Han'guk Chosŏn is to be called Chosŏn, then write it as Chosŏn. If you must abbreviate it, using the character '朝' (Cho) would be fine. But like a traitor dropping his surname (逆賊놈의 去姓), they drop the '朝' (Cho) character and use the '鮮' (Sŏn) character, saying Sŏnin (鮮人 - Korean person), Sŏnmi (鮮米 - Korean rice), Sŏnmun (鮮文 - Korean writing). Because of this, many comical (滑稽) things happen. To give a real example (實例), recently cholera (虎列剌) was prevalent in Fukuoka Prefecture (福岡縣), and the police authorities (警察官署) instructed (訓示) the public (民間) to strictly avoid raw water (生水) and fresh fish (鮮魚 - sengo/saengŏ). The people misunderstood 'sengyo/saengŏ' (鮮魚) as 'Chosŏn-produced fish products' (朝鮮産魚物) and for a time refused to buy or eat fish products (魚物) that came from Chosŏn, causing great losses (大損害) to the fish merchants (魚物商). If the authorities were to thoroughly implement (徹底히 實行) their own slogan of "equal benevolence for all" (一視同仁) and drop characters for Japanese (日本人) or mainlanders (內地人) just as they dropped the '朝' from Chosŏn, calling Japanese 'Honjin' (本人 - main person) and mainlanders 'Chijin' (地人 - land person), misunderstandings (誤解) would surely arise again. If the courthouse (裁判所) or police station (警察署) issued an order for the 'Honjin' (本人) to appear, the enforcement officials would likely round up all the Japanese. And 'Chijin' (地人) would be understood as 'people of the earth/underground,' meaning corpses (송장), which is also a cause for concern (可慮). In any case, dropping the '朝' (Cho) character from Chosŏn and using the '鮮' (Sŏn) character is not only insulting (侮辱) to Chosŏn but also completely harmful and without benefit (百害無益). <99>

**Summary**

This collection of six short anecdotes from 1922 offers satirical commentary on various figures and societal issues in colonial Korea. It mocks a miserly aristocrat who suddenly becomes charitable after a dream, an ignorant Korean botany teacher trying to impress a Japanese colleague, the recently deceased Dr. Deguchi known for his insulting remarks about Koreans, a fickle aristocrat who joins and quits organizations based on convenience, the superficial differences between the "military" Governor-General Terauchi and the "cultural" Governor-General Saitō, and the problematic Japanese colonial practice of abbreviating 'Chosŏn' (Korea) to 'Sen' (鮮), leading to confusion and perceived insult. The pieces collectively critique the flaws of both Korean elites and Japanese colonial figures and policies.

For historians, this text provides valuable insights into contemporary Korean perspectives on wealth and philanthropy, education standards and national pride (or lack thereof), Korean-Japanese interactions and stereotypes, collaborator figures ('inchworm aristocrat'), the perceived hypocrisy of Japan's colonial administration ('Cultural Policy', 'One Body, Same Benevolence'), and linguistic resistance to colonial naming conventions ('鮮' vs. '朝鮮'). The anecdotes reveal social tensions, cultural commentary, and criticisms circulating within Korean society under Japanese rule.
