▲Company Announcement▲/To the People of Chŏlla Namdo (全南人士)

The original intention (本意) in establishing the Kaebyŏk Chŏnnam Branch Office (開闢全南支社) was solely to provide every convenience for the people of Chŏlla Namdo in subscribing to this magazine (本誌). However, due to unavoidable circumstances (事情) during this time (這間), we have instead caused much inconvenience (不便) to our readers (讀者諸位). Although this was not our intention, the Main Office (本社) considers this deeply regrettable (遺憾). Until such time (時機) as the organization (機關) of the branch office in your region (貴地) is fully equipped (完備), the Main Office will directly execute (執行) business matters (業務) such as sending copies (送本), collecting payments (集金), etc. Therefore, from now on, please direct magazine requests (雜誌請求) and payment procedures (送金節次) directly to the Main Office (本社).<60>

**Summary**

This is an announcement from the publisher of *Kaebyŏk* magazine to its readers in Chŏlla Namdo province. It informs them that due to unspecified "unavoidable circumstances," the recently established Chŏnnam Branch Office cannot currently provide services effectively. Consequently, the main office in Seoul will handle subscriptions, distribution, and payments directly until the branch office is fully operational. For historians, this announcement sheds light on the practical difficulties faced by Korean cultural enterprises like magazines during the colonial period. The vague mention of "unavoidable circumstances" could hint at financial troubles, logistical issues, or possibly even pressure from colonial authorities, reflecting the challenging environment for nationalist or culturally significant publications.
