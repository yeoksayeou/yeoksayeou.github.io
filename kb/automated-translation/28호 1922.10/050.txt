Preface
Since my youth, I have greatly hoped to travel north once to the great plains of the Central Plains (Chungwŏn). In the winter of Kyŏngsul [1910], when I carried my books to the capital (Kyŏngsa), I keenly felt the shocks of the era, and further planned to travel abroad. However, my unrestrained journey unexpectedly took me east across the sea to Japan (Pusang). During a brief stay in Edo, I had the chance to associate with Chinese international students; this was my first contact with the Chinese people. My long-held desire to travel north constantly urged my preparations. When the Kimyŏn [1919] Movement arose, I hastily became a refugee traveler in Shanghae, fulfilling a long-standing wish, perhaps. However, amidst the incessant bustle, opportunities to contact Chinese people were truly few, and there was no time for research or understanding.
Indeed, the China problem is not trivial but momentous; not local but global. In other words, it is a central world problem. Consequently, the discussions and observations of numerous world scholars and politicians must number in the thousands, if not hundreds. Moreover, as it is currently the focal point of global attention, some advocate for the Open Door and Equal Opportunity, some speak of cession (割與) and dismemberment (爪分), and some talk of support (扶援) and assistance, leading to much confused debate. In any case, it is a fact that it has become a great world event, a great world problem. For me, with my lack of learning, to dare to offer any discussion seems presumptuous. However, for us Koreans, who have a long historical relationship with China in the past, and who have the most urgent mutual relationship in the present and future regarding the problem called China, it is an unavoidable fact that we are more deeply involved than anyone else in the world. <46> What critiques have Koreans, with such a vital relationship, produced from ancient times to the present? If there were any in the past, they were unconditionally subservient writings (事大之筆) and foolish observations (妄察之蹟), doing nothing more than bringing great shame and humiliation (奇恥大辱) upon the Korean people. Since the Pyŏngja Invasion (丙子亂), what loyalty was so consistently maintained towards the Ming Dynasty (明朝), and what rejection was so thorough towards the Qing Dynasty (淸朝)? The term "toenom" [derogatory term for Manchus/Chinese] became a kind of abusive epithet for Chinese people. In recent times, as various strong powers spat upon and rejected the corruption of the Chinese people, we may have followed suit with contempt, but unlike the attention paid by the strong powers, we failed to offer any notice. Though one might say we had no time to look after others amidst our own decline (自體之淪沈), let alone the past (過去는 尙矣라 勿論하고). Since Kyŏngsul [1910], not only has it become a gathering place for so-called exiled guests, but a million of our own people have migrated to the region of the Three Eastern Provinces (東三省), making the depth of the relationship in the present and future incomparable to the past. Especially for us who think of national restoration and development, can we say there has been even a single word of discussion or a single character of critique regarding this? Truly, our indifference (等閒) is beyond words. If we suffered such unreasonable conquest in the past, and if we have such a vital relationship now, this is not a matter to be treated with indifference, yet it has been overlooked so carelessly. This is something we should reflect upon and awaken to.
I tried to write from my own many feelings, but I could not fully live up to my original thoughts. Regarding the overall view of China, I intended to look at it from an observational aspect in three parts: 1) National View, 2) Political View, 3) Cultural View; and from a discussion aspect in two parts: 1) Future View of China, 2) Korea's View Toward China. However, this truly vast and complex (浩繁) view of China cannot be easily detailed in a short piece. But first, I wish to briefly describe the most recent situation and touch upon a part of the problem.

One, On Nationality
One
My first opportunity to interact with Chinese people was during my time in Tokyo, Japan (日本東京). On the one hand, I saw the contemptuous attitude of the Japanese, and among our own students, while there might not have been contempt, there was certainly no attitude of praise. However, I approached with much goodwill, trying to get closer and understand them better. But generally, Chinese people tend to have a somewhat exclusionary air towards foreigners. Without a prior earnest introduction and understanding, they do not readily permit casual acquaintance. Even if one makes an acquaintance through some chance, they have a habit of naturally overlooking it afterward. Therefore, my close friendships with them were few, and my understanding remained limited. My impression upon first encountering Chinese people at that time was: outwardly they seem naive (어리숙하다), but inwardly they possess some substance. They are people who cannot <47> flow with the times, yet they seem to try to understand the times. The air of arrogance (妄大) was still present, yet there was no frivolous (輕佻) attitude. They held onto their conservative nature, yet they seemed to yearn (憧憬) for the new. How could this possibly capture even a fraction of the truth within? But it's not as if this aspect doesn't exist in part. The Japanese look down on them, but they don't seem to mind (介意). They are treated poorly in Japanese boarding houses, but they accept it meekly. It seems like they are revealing their own naivete, but they endure it while having some calculation (打算) in their hearts. Thus, all their actions fail to change rapidly with the times, but they try to understand and digest the times, basing their actions on their own judgment. In any case, whether it's piling up pork (豬肉) inside their desks (書案裡) to eat, or their reluctance to lose their own distinctive character, they carry on regardless of whether foolish people (㥬人) laugh derisively (睡笑). Even among Chinese students studying in Japan, while they might learn scientific techniques for a time, they harbor great antipathy towards Japan itself. They also tend to look down on Japan rather than up to it. Seeing that the leaders of the anti-Japanese movement in China in recent years have all been students who studied in Japan makes this quite clear. This was my initial general observation (汎觀) from seeing Chinese students during my stay in Japan. Once my own footsteps entered the Chinese mainland, my first point of arrival being Shanghae, my perspective, conversely, lost its measure. The first impression Shanghae's wharf (埠頭) gave me was that the nation's productive power was truly great. But perhaps because they were so numerous, and at first glance, only the lowest class laborers were visible, any sense of reverence for the nation disappeared, replaced only by a kind of contempt, dissatisfaction, aversion, and cursing. Afterward, during my continued stay there, the goodwill I had previously held completely vanished. Furthermore, the degree of criticism and cursing gradually increased. Regarding the Chinese people in general, while seeing commercial facilities might evoke some goodwill externally, they were still just a people who only knew the outside. Especially when seeing notices in parks stating "Chinese clothes wearers or dogs, or those carrying dogs, may not enter arbitrarily," or witnessing the arrogance (跋扈) of Westerners, nameless anger often flared up in my chest, and I harbored much criticism and dissatisfaction, thinking, "Is this the incompetence and shamelessness of a nation facing destruction?"

Indeed, what kind of place is Shanghae? It is territory belonging to the Chinese people. It is also the great bustling center of East Asia. Yet, it is the very place where the great shame of the Chinese people is manifest. It is the place where the Chinese people seem to have met their doom. Given such a place, it's understandable that I developed these preconceived notions. Not only that, it is a fact that the Chinese people are currently at the very peak of life and death, undergoing a great filtering (濾過) process in chaotic darkness (混沌暗黑). From this perspective, if one makes a superficial judgment (浮觀), there is nothing but to attach unfavorable labels and criticize. The people appearing on the streets or in other common places <48> are either lower-class laborers or members of the lower strata; even the middle class seems scarce. At first glance, one gets the impression, "Are all Chinese people just like this?" Furthermore, the so-called upper class is said to be either intoxicated (魔醉) by opium (鴉片) and gambling (睹博) or consists only of corrupt old politicians and warlords. From this, one might conclude there is nothing more to see. Last year, when the American congressional delegation came East, the Pacific Association hosted a welcome reception in Shanghae. At that time, leading figures of China like Son Ilsan (Sun Yat-sen), T'ang Shaoyi, and U T'ingfang (Wu Tingfang) attended. A friend who observed the meeting told me later, half-jokingly, "Are there really that many such distinguished figures and modern youths in China?" If so, we Koreans have no room to criticize others. However, when looking only at the situation in a corner of Shanghae externally, it's not entirely unreasonable to suddenly view them with such contempt. But generally, the Chinese are a people who absolutely cannot be judged externally. As mentioned above, they certainly possess some inner substance. Truly, without several layers of deep observation, one cannot claim to know their true inner face. I too, based on temporary external appearances, harbored much disappointment towards the Chinese people. But as I gradually took another step forward to observe and feel, the notion arose that they are not a people to be viewed superficially (凡然히 浮觀할 바이아니라), and I wanted to explore them once more. The Chinese are of the same Yellow race as us, but it is a fact that there are distinct differences. From our perspective, all their actions often seem utterly incompatible. Sometimes they even evoke considerable unpleasantness. Therefore, at first, it seems like unconditional opposition is warranted. Trying to observe the Chinese people with such an opposing view, even slightly, is a misunderstanding. From this point, I came to think it is better to find a path of observation under a somewhat affirmative viewpoint first. Of course, for a nation possessing a great history of the world's oldest civilization and a huge population of over four hundred million, currently in a transitional period of major national transformation, even if some flaws and pains are visible, it is a fact that an indomitable national character must lie latent within them. The above is nothing but my intuition and direct observation. Going a step further, if I were to summarize their national essence, what kind of nation would they be called? First, looking at the great display of their national activity in the past, one cannot help but bestow the praise "great." The essence of observing a nation lies in clarifying the nature and substance that are the source of that vitality, and discovering both their strengths and weaknesses. Regarding the nature and substance of the Chinese people, their own discussions go without saying, and foreigners' critiques are numerous. While the general level of introduction and understanding cannot be called truly weak, for me, lacking years of research and investigation, to suddenly pass judgment on the nature and substance of this huge nation seems presumptuous. However, I feel the need to purely express my own views under conscientious criticism, seeking correction from wiser minds, and expanding my own thoughts. Foreign<49>ers' critiques and their own discussions can be found in numerous books. While fair evaluations are not absent, a kind of fundamental error has often existed. This is because, from the foreigner's perspective, firstly, under a psychology of contempt and jealousy, the national character hidden beneath is overlooked indifferently. Secondly, under a self-interested psychology, each discusses from their own advantageous angle, resorting to temporary false words to curry favor (買好) with the national sentiment. From their own perspective, under the floating notion of arrogant self-importance (妄自尊大), which can be called an inherent weakness of the Chinese, they primarily focus only on blind, exaggerated arguments. Here lies the definite existence of a fundamental error. My view may not break through all errors to reach some correct target, but lacking the foreigner's psychology of contempt or self-interest, and without any intention of blind exaggeration, I might have somewhat escaped the flaws of the two errors mentioned above. Continuing, to briefly state my view: the nature of the Chinese people is moderate (持中的) and harmonious (調和的). The reasons will be explained below, but it can be readily known by observing their current state of life and culture, which are products of this nature. For example, when encountering any problem or event, they do not demand a resolution or seek to change the situation. Instead, they seek their own satisfaction within that very circumstance. They do not adopt an attitude of straightforward struggle to meet the demands of the problem or event. Their method of response is merely to harmonize their own desires, keeping the fundamental spirit centered (持中). Regarding their substance, it could be called phlegmatic (膽液質). Whether viewed physiologically or rationally, while the spirit of struggle and fortitude may be somewhat weak, one cannot help but acknowledge their robust power of harmonious digestion and their tenacious, moderate conservatism (持中的保守性) when observing them. Thus, this judgment seems plausible. It is also true that the nature and substance of continental peoples are close to this.

Now, in discussing the nature and substance above, it might seem entirely laudatory at first glance. However, while strengths certainly lie therein, the great flaws that have led to the current great decline, and also the shortcomings of having developed only a monotonous spiritual metaphysics within the oldest civilized history, failing to produce the scientific civilization of the modern era, also reside here. First, looking at the strengths: because they possess a harmonious and moderate (調和持中) nature combined with a phlegmatic (膽液) substance – though the relationship of geographical advantage is not negligible – they were able to harmonize with nature earlier than other peoples and pioneer their own lives. Thus, with a moderate spirit (持中的精神), they took gradual steps, planning their self-development within a sphere of harmony with nature. They sought not to lose the territory once pioneered by their own hands, even if they couldn't expand beyond it, and tried to prevent any changes. Not only that, during times when the nation flourished abundantly, they became the leader <50> of the East Asian peoples, calling their own territory the "world under heaven" (天下) and acting as if they were the overall arbiters of the world. Besides this, the research and development in the spiritual aspect of harmonious culture cannot be denied its greatness. Their great past achievements are undoubtedly gifts of their nature and substance. To specifically list their strengths: that the great continent of East Asia became the possession of the Han people (漢民族) must be called a special favor, but in any case, it is great (偉大), not narrow or small-scoped; it is enduring (持久), not short-term; it is substantial (實的), not empty or void; it is constructive and accomplishing (建設的 成就的), not destructive; it is gentle and obedient (順柔), not cruel; it is digestive (消解), not focused on immediate results; it is tenacious (强靭), not fragmented.

Second, looking at the weaknesses: because they possess the nature described above, they adapted harmoniously to nature, achieving passive progress in their lives within the limits dictated by nature's commands. However, they failed to strengthen the self as a foundation to conquer nature. Unable to attain their own satisfaction, they became compliant with their circumstances (所遇的境地に順停), failing to demand more from the future. Instead, they sought refuge behind and beside, aiming to be content with whatever came (隨遇に安). Their life, lacking improvement and creativity, could only become antiquated (古化) or follow old ways (循薦), or else face self-destruction. Therefore, despite having thousands of years of civilized history, their general thought and culture became antiquated, hollowed out, entered into abstraction, became metaphysical (玄學化), and failed to produce a scientific, material civilization. Systems of aristocratic classes and numerous other empty formalities and false etiquettes (虛文僞禮) were established, preventing the emergence of the spirit of freedom and equality. Everything became fixed at one point. Not only was there no room for the production of the new, but even antiquation and adherence to old ways (循舊) failed to reach their limit. Instead, they gradually proceeded only into the realm of self-destruction and decline. Finally, in the last stages of weakness, political machinations (權謀術數) and dark, sinister craftiness (陰凶奸滑) also obliterated the purity of their original nature and substance. To list their flaws again: arrogant self-importance (妄自尊大); non-courageous, non-struggling (非勇進奮鬪); antiquated (古化); inactive (非活潑); exclusionary (排外); muddled (糊塗); not clear-cut (非明快).

Where there are strengths, there will naturally be weaknesses. For a nation that cannot but be called great (未嘗不偉大), to reach the point today where it suffers daily encroachment and plunder (攘奪), facing the pessimistic prospect of even being discussed for dismemberment (爪分) by the weak, can be attributed to the calamitous fate (劫運) of a nation's rise and fall. However, it is a pain inevitably present during a period of national renewal. That they flowed too much into their weaknesses and failed to devise measures for self-strengthening is the sole (惟一) primary cause. Yet, if we are to make a final prediction about the future of the Chinese nation, seeing the daily acceleration of national awakening and the daily unfolding progress of the times, their national resurgence is surely a fact as clear as daylight (明若觀火). <51>

Three, Political View
One
Regarding politics, if viewed not in the modern sense but in the Chinese sense of politics, China is a state of political purification, the Chinese people are a nation of political monotony, and Chinese thought and culture are characterized by political monotony. For the general populace, apart from living in their respective homes and families, all endeavors are related to politics. The honor and victory in life are thought to exist only in politics, becoming the standard target of the people's greatest desires. Politics itself is understood as the oldest and highest thing, something difficult to attain easily. Consequently, four types of politics reached extreme development: heroic politics, personality politics, mysterious politics, and scheming politics. Although the general environment was one of political purification, it failed to become popularized or democratized. It was believed that one had to be a born hero, possess strategic cunning, or have means of mysterious craftiness. Thus, those who attained positions through any unjust opportunity or means considered it the highest glory. Lacking conscience and violating justice, they employed all sorts of ghostly and sneaky methods to fully satisfy their desires, stopping at nothing. However, the populace, intoxicated by politics, couldn't help but praise the cleverness of those scheming methods. The ultimate goal of life was thought to be in so-called politics and becoming an official (做官). It was thought that the path to this goal existed only there. After the establishment of the civil service examination system, those who participated, the so-called literati class, were the highest among the nation's classes, and their highest desire was to pass the exam and become an official (登科做官). Under such a system, the general populace couldn't help but become fixated on becoming officials. Even listening to the common Chinese phrase "shēng guān fā cái" (升官發財 - get promoted and become rich), one understands that office means money, means wealth and honor, means reputation. When the people's entire life effort is directed towards becoming an official, this becomes their specialty. Those who fail in this specialty, naturally out of frustration, but also unable to cope with hunger and cold, become so-called heroic bandits. The mounted bandits demanding provisions (餉馬賊), currently China's greatest affliction, can be considered one type. The disturbances caused by these disgruntled elements were incessant, placing the general populace in a state of chaos and weakness. This is called political injury, political sin.

Two
First, observing recent history, when the Aisin Gioro clan (愛親覺羅氏) of Manchuria (滿洲) occupied the Central Plains, their true intention was not to improve the political, cultural, and other aspects of the original Chinese people, i.e., the Han (漢族), but purely to pursue the development of their own clan. It is no exaggeration to say they viewed the Han people as mere slaves. Yet, even when ruled by the Mongol Yuan Dynasty (元國) before that, the Han people simply endured meekly. <52> Even when subjected to the conquest of foreign peoples like this, the Han people, possessing an overly harmonious nature, not only shamelessly accepted the oppression but their desire to become officials (做官) did not diminish in the slightest. When they did become officials, the true meaning of politics was completely ignored, and if possible, they did not hesitate to commit any crime. While their psychology might be interpreted partly as intending to worsen the politics of the foreign Yuan or Qing dynasties, it ultimately only resulted in self-harm and self-damage. The general populace suffered even more from their bad politics, and the motive for the current great political turmoil lies hidden here as well. Since the revolution occurred, it was not a revolutionary revolution but carried the lingering influence of the previous Hong Xiuquan (洪秀全) rebellion. Also, as European winds blew eastward, general thought and psychology changed. Additionally, under the psychology of political injury, some heroic bandit-type individuals responded, leading to a situation like "wind cries, cranes screech" [panic and uncertainty]. In the Xinhai year [1911], the revolution was established within a few months. However, the arrogance of Yuan Shikai (袁世凱), capering under the banner of heroic banditry, desecrated the sanctity of the revolution. Furthermore, even with the temporary emergence of figures like Huang Hsing (黃興) and Son Ilsan (Sun Yat-sen), the lack of fundamental awakening among the general populace regarding the revolution meant that, in reality, it was like trying to draw a tiger but failing (畵虎難成). On the contrary, the old politics, which had managed to control the people even amidst corruption, was fundamentally destroyed externally. Consequently, they fell into a great difficulty of being unable to advance or retreat, entering a period of great national chaos, which is precisely today's situation. Thus, while the outer skin of "republic" and "equality" exists, inwardly there has been no improvement; it remains as it was. Moreover, the general populace's political desire, i.e., the ambition to become an official, has only increased. This outer skin, rather than hindering, provides many conveniences for fulfilling the ambition of becoming an official and getting rich (做官發財的野慾). The general populace's awareness of modern politics has not improved at all. In this state of neither flowing nor stopping, neither advancing nor retreating, stuck in a vortex with no way forward, backward, left, or right, all sorts of ghosts emerge, and strange phenomena abound in countless variations, creating a period dominated by heroic bandit-type temporary power holders, namely the military governors (督軍). It has become no different from the Warring States period (六國時代) with warlords carving up territory (羣雄割據). Therefore, conflicts between A and B, fights between B and C, continue year after year without cease. The art of alliances is constantly practiced. The wars between the Zhili and Anhui cliques (直皖) and the Fengtian and Zhili cliques (奉直) are the clearest examples. Besides these, disputes over governorships, territories, power, and factions are continuous. Even after major wars like the Zhili-Anhui or Fengtian-Zhili conflicts, the victors lack the strategy and ability to manage the aftermath effectively. Why? Because these individuals, originally weak in faith and acting out of self-interest, are fickle like morning glories and evening primroses [changing easily], prone to inconsistency. An enemy in the morning can become a friend in the evening. The losers conspire against the victors among themselves. Looking at it this way, victory and defeat are uncertain, right and wrong are indistinguishable. To take the recent Fengtian-Zhili war as an example: after the Fengtian clique (奉派) was defeated, the Zhili clique (直派) became dominant. Government, central authority – everything became the exclusive possession of the Zhili clique. The Fengtian clique, meanwhile, plotted revenge relentlessly. The Anhui clique (皖派) joined them, <53> alliances were formed with the Southern faction (南方派), and other dissatisfied groups and heroic bandit factions blindly followed (雷同). Their momentum shows signs of an impending clash that seems unlikely to end soon. It is impossible to predict what tragedies might unfold. Furthermore, caught in this power struggle, various military leaders relentlessly expand their own armies. Even if these armies are incompetent, combining the North and South of China, they exceed several million. This army, it must be said, only brings harm, not benefit, to the country and the people. It is merely a tool for bolstering the power of each military governor and serves as their personal amulet. Not only that, due to the lack of military funds, mutinies occur everywhere. Also, if soldiers are discharged, they become nothing but heroic bandit-type horse thieves. The true state of affairs behind the political scene cannot be fully described. Seeing this glimpse above, one can roughly estimate the extent of it.

Three
However, one thing to reconsider is that although they are currently in such a bizarrely chaotic period, facing a moment where survival is uncertain, for such a great nation in its major transitional phase, this process is, in some respects, truly unavoidable. It is a flaw bound to exist after political injury. Not only that, the mutual capering of various politicians and military men signifies their own self-elimination and self-destruction. Thus, new figures for a new era will emerge. The recent enthusiasm for the general New Culture Movement and the calls for social reform movements are strongly urging the opportunity for building a New China. This is certainly a continuation of the Second Revolutionary Movement. The May Fourth Movement of students in the sixth year of the Republic of China, opposing bureaucrats and Japan, first showed this opportunity and marked a step forward. In this way, while pure anarchism is not absent, the emergence of modern, new politics is anticipated.

Three, Cultural View
One
While Western culture controls the modern era, exhibiting a near monopoly, the existence of Eastern culture cannot be denied. In this context, the Chinese people, as major contributors to Eastern culture, must be called a cultural nation. It is also a fact that China is one of the birthplaces of the world's oldest civilizations, so their cultural capacity is recognizably rich. However, from a modern perspective, they cannot be called a *new* cultural nation. Not only that, even from an ancient perspective, while they might be called a cultural nation of a monopolistic, special-class type, it cannot be said that a culture of shared rights and equality ever became widespread.

What is culture? It is the expression of a lifestyle pattern. And what is life? It is the actions and movements based on the inherent nature and substance of the people. Therefore, although there might be some points of domination and change related to the national environment, Eastern people have a life and <54> culture based on their nature, and Western people have a life and culture based on theirs. Similarly, the Chinese people must have a life and culture based on their nature and substance. Accordingly, the Chinese people have historically had a harmonious (調和的) and moderate (持中的) life and culture based on their essential nature. What meaning and characteristics does a culture derived from harmony and moderation possess? First, by examining Chinese history and the reflection of the current populace's life, it can be readily understood. From the very first step of pioneering their lives, the Chinese people simply adapted to nature, listened to nature, and waiting for Heaven's mandate became their sole creed. Even if they had any desires or demands of their own, they dared not resist nature, conquer nature, or advance fiercely. Therefore, general culture flourished only in顺自然听自然 (following nature, listening to nature), and its ultimate culmination could only reach harmony. Thus, metaphysics (玄學) in the supra-physical realm developed to an extreme degree. Its goal had no real predetermined point or direction but was entrusted to absolute mystery and supreme difficulty. Regardless of whether there was substance within or not, they only strived to explore. Leaving aside humanity itself, they placed trust in and pursued something within nature itself. Life, conversely, was disregarded, viewed as sinful, and they sought to conquer the self by borrowing from nature. Among these, Daoist learning (仙學), in the end, purely advocated for nature as it is, even criticizing all human activities like culture and life. Even looking at Confucianism (孔學), considered the center of Chinese culture, although it didn't make absolute claims about life problems fundamentally like Daoism, its various methods of discourse always viewed life too directly, striving to bind it with empty formalities and false etiquette (虛文僞禮). While its contributions cannot be denied, its harmful effects also cannot be ignored. It fundamentally disregarded human instinct, attempting to hollow out the path of general thought towards metaphysics, making it void. Not only that, if it paid any attention to human culture and life, it only sought to restrain everything under some method. It spoke of the absolute class-based, absolute aristocratic distinction between the superior man (君子) and the petty man (小人), implying that only the so-called superior man could understand the Way of Yao and Shun as described in Confucius's life, and that the petty man could absolutely not reach it. Thus, culture itself was thought to be the exclusive property of the superior man, a rare treasure possessed by only one or two, decidedly not something to be universalized. Besides this, constantly talking about the governance of Tang, Yu, and the Three Dynasties (唐虞三代之治), it caused the general populace to value the old and admire antiquity (古を慕), leading to antiquation (古化). This not only inflicted a fatal wound on the nation but also caused Chinese culture after Confucius to gradually regress. Because of this, the populace degenerated while striving to become antiquated, and culture stagnated while trying to become antiquated, ultimately stopping there. And the final result of that antiquation is the current state of the Chinese people today.

Two <55>
To reiterate, culture, being in a state of pure tranquility due to its antiquation (古化的), and moreover being class-based, privileged, and supremely difficult, meant that only one in a thousand or ten thousand attempted to learn it. The rest fell away from it, becoming unworthy of mention. Therefore, the extreme disparity (懸隔) in the cultural level of modern Chinese people is precisely due to this. Since one cannot stand against a thousand or ten thousand, at first glance, the general populace seems culturally unaware. Also, looking at the state of life, one can infer it from the reflection of culture. With Confucianism being the center of all culture and life, the foundation of all life began from patriarchalism (家長主義) under that class-based, aristocratic system. Based on the subjective view that "Heaven is high, Earth is low; Qian and Kun are determined" (天高地卑乾坤定矣), the hierarchy between men and women was absolutely determined, vesting all authority in the family exclusively in men. Economically, based on a predetermined fatalistic view (宿命觀), under the concept of "fortune" (福), wealth (富) was said to be something not everyone could attain. Moreover, it can be said that economics was purely viewed with neglect (閒却視). Therefore, even with heavenly blessed rich resources right before their eyes, they did not strive to develop them, and the gap (懸隔) between rich and poor became even more severe. Consequently, everything became polarized: among people, one was either a saint (聖者) or a great fool (大愚); economically, one was either vastly rich (大富) or utterly poor (大貧). Since saints and the vastly rich were extremely few, looking at the entire nation, it could be said there were only great fools and the utterly poor. Although what has been described above seems like a view of ancient times, it is precisely the current state. Even after the revolution occurred, the Republic was established, and contact with new culture began, the general populace thinks that cultural movements or anything else are tasks for a single saint or a great rich person, not for everyone individually. Furthermore, possessing the characteristic of moderate conservatism (持中的保守), they are not easily willing to engage with new culture. The notion of "Great China" (大中國) and arrogant self-importance (妄自尊大) is ingrained in their minds. They call Westerners "foreign devils" (洋鬼子) and other foreigners something else, displaying strong self-conceit. In other words, they would rather be stragglers of the era than readily abandon the inherent character of their own old culture and life. However, having already come into contact with new culture, general awareness has gradually arisen. The development of women, which showed considerable activity even in ancient times, can be said to have achieved development exceeding that of men in recent times. Although general progress is not rapid, it has proceeded slowly over time. Yet, the emergence of excessive disparities stems from the failure to break through the fundamental errors originating from the old cultural consciousness. For example, there are high-level scholars and writings, but no popular works. While Hunan Province (湖省) has female members in its provincial assembly, other provinces lack even the beginnings of a women's rights movement.

Three
In any case, trying to live a modern life with one's own old culture is not just inconvenient; it is amidst the suffering <56> and difficulties experienced during this period that awareness is beginning to dawn. Although they were among the first East Asians to come into contact with new culture, the lack of significant development until now is partly due to their conservative nature acting as an obstacle (魔障), but it is also a fact that they failed because they lacked fundamental, thorough awakening and merely tried to adopt elements or harmonize them. Currently, there is no shortage of world-class scholars and great figures, nor a lack of significant institutions in some areas, but they are not universalized; rather, they remain specialized, making it impossible to recognize any true value under the genuine meaning of culture. However, very recently, general social movements show much yearning (憧憬) for and eagerness to engage with new culture. Looking at the degree of daily development, it is truly incomparable to the past; there are points worth noting with admiration (蔚然). In this way, when the entire Chinese populace fully contacts new culture, I believe a civilization harmonizing Eastern and Western cultures will be produced.

Four, Future View of China
One
The China problem has already become a major world problem. Accordingly, China's future course has major implications for the world's future. Therefore, foreigners' attention to China's future is undeniably urgent. However, individual observations have traditionally been very confused. Before the outbreak of the European War, pessimism was indeed prevalent, and direct dismemberment (爪分) and swallowing were advocated. After the European War ended and the eras of imperialism and militarism passed, these direct assertions somewhat softened. Furthermore, observing the progress of the Chinese people, some optimistic or supportive factions emerged. However, the theory of joint administration (共管說) seems to persist. Yet, the changing times indeed make it a fact that China will likely not reach final destruction. Now, dismemberment is impossible, and sole annexation is impossible. External strong powers can do nothing but stand by and watch. Moreover, they are in a situation where they cannot help but offer support. Why? Because there is likely no one willing to pursue their ambitions by sacrificing blood and lives, and even if there were, the overall situation makes it impossible. This is truly the progress of the times and the climate of the environment.

Two
Observing the current attitudes of the external powers towards China, they are generally neutral. If one strong power shows intent to invade and swallow, the others try to restrain it. That's all there is to it. From this, under policies like Equal Opportunity and the Open Door, they merely strive through peaceful means to curry favor (買好) with the Chinese sentiment and enjoy industrial benefits. Therefore, the Paris Conference (巴里會議) and the Washington Conference (華盛頓會議) ultimately discussed, in part or whole, the China problem. In the end, they only decided to support China based on mutual equality. Consequently, China's external <57> fears and dangers have greatly diminished. Now, it is solely an internal problem. Although it is currently still in a period of great danger and chaos, it has escaped the brink of destruction, as mentioned earlier. Looking at the overall situation, it has reached a point where it can achieve self-strengthening without hindrance (掣肘) from left or right. This moment can be called the starting point for the unfolding of a new chapter for the Chinese people. From here, the final confusion, at first glance, seems to be driving towards greater chaos, but it is definitely the motive for the emergence of the new. Recent events like the internal strife of the Fengtian-Zhili conflict (奉直戰), the instability of the cabinet, the final disarray of finances, the daily intensification of troop riots demanding pay (閙餉風潮), and the mutinies of surplus soldiers are all the final throes of its self-elimination. Within this, national self-awareness is improving daily, and the intensity of general new movements is further increasing, looking towards the opportune moment. Among these, notable examples include the democratic movement of the academic circle led by Ch'ae Wŏnbae (Cai Yuanpei) and his faction, the socialist movement of Chin Toksu (Chen Duxiu) and his faction, and in the political sphere, the movement for federated provincial self-government (聯省自治運動) led by Chin Kyŏngmyŏng (Chen Jiongming) and his faction. Looking at this, due to the extremely vast population and the historically wide gap (懸隔) in cultural levels, its renewal cannot be called rapid, but its potential exists. Furthermore, the Chinese people, possessing a harmonious and moderate (調和持中) nature, once they gain a complete awakening regarding the new culture, will be able to digest and build upon it. I assert this confidently. Therefore, regarding China's future, whether viewed from the progress of the times, the external environment, or its own potential, it has escaped great danger and found the path to self-strengthening. Optimism must be permitted, but this is certainly not something to be achieved easily, nor can the work of self-strengthening be completed within a short period.

Five, Korea's View Toward China
One
My shallow view of China has been briefly presented above. Along with commentary, discussing the future view of China, I touched upon the relationship between the world and China, and China and the world, allowing for considerable optimism. Now, finally, regarding Korea's view toward China, I wanted to write down my brief opinions and shallow arguments based on my own many feelings. The relationship between Korea and China, needless to say about the past, is most urgently intertwined in the present and future, more than any other relationship for anyone else. This is something no one can deny. However, has there ever been a genuine critique of China by us Koreans? As briefly mentioned in the preface above, there was pure, unconditional admiration and blind reverence. More recently, due to resentment stemming from past relationships, there has been opposition and criticism. But from a perspective of vital interest, have we ever, even in contemporary newspapers or magazines, critiqued <58> or proposed ideas regarding the Korea-China issue, considering the past, present, and future? Truly, we cannot help but feel our extreme lack of awareness. If we became nationally greatly weakened due to unconditional conquest by the Chinese in the past, this is truly not something to be overlooked indifferently (等閒히 看過). Also, considering that the region of the Eastern Provinces (東省) was territory (疆域) pioneered by the sweat and blood (汗血) of our own ancestors, and that recently several million of our own people have migrated there, almost like recovering lost homeland, and it has become practically the base of operations (策源地) for the independence movement of our homeland currently, not to mention other various relationships – if we Koreans have the will for national development and the ideal of extending new life, this is truly not something to be neglected (忽諸). Therefore, I do not claim to have any particularly vital perspective on this. However, I hope that our general public will henceforth raise this as a social issue and earnestly research it. First, from the perspective of the current situation: the first is the geographical relationship, and the second is the relationship arising spontaneously and unavoidably from the current environment of the Korean nation. Regarding the first relationship, even looking at the current so-called borders, a land separated by just a narrow strip of water (一葦之帶水) forms the boundary between the two countries. Not only that, but from the perspective that the other side of that boundary line is the old territory of our own ancestors, if we seek national development, it is inevitable that we must advance towards that other shore. Regarding the second relationship, as our own current environment has reached an impasse, in the final course where various options are impossible, we have no choice but to come to that other shore. These two inevitable relationships constitute the most pressing major issue currently. If this is a situation that we Koreans cannot avoid even if we try, then proactively planning the resolution of the problem is one of our tasks. Furthermore, since this can be considered beneficial rather than detrimental to Koreans, and arguably not greatly harmful to the Chinese either, we should properly protect this relationship and not miss the path for our own development. Therefore, let us submit this problem to the collective discussion of our society, first accumulating efforts in research. Let us put aside (姑捨) feelings of resentment about the past, avoid blindly following (雷同) foreigners' contemptuous views, and under an earnest understanding and a somewhat deeper, idealistic plan, first pursue measures to foster Korea-China friendship (朝中親睦) and enhance relations between the two countries. Also, as our own endeavor, we should support our compatriots already residing in the Eastern Provinces region. The first step is to initiate appropriate economic and industrial facilities, encouraging migration on one hand, and providing economic assistance to compatriots already there on the other. In the past, those who raised this issue were often, in fact, vagrants <59> or swindlers, whose capering created significant obstacles (魔障) for this enterprise, causing general entrepreneurs to become quite cool-headed (冷哲) about it. However, if this is a suitable land for the Korean nation's endeavors, even if there are one or two failures, we must proactively strive forward. If we try again with a proper foundation and a solid budget, we will undoubtedly bring about (齋來) the anticipated success. Otherwise, we are abandoning our own source of fortune ourselves. From now on, I hope that our society's joint enterprise will quickly commence.

Postscript: Although the title is grandly "Perspective on the Future Relationship of Korea to China," the content has turned out quite weak. This is partly due to time constraints, but also due to procrastination (懈怠). I have extracted parts from my diary after arriving in China and tried to broach this issue first. I only hope for the reader's generous understanding (厚諒).

**Summary**

The author, Pukryŏ Tonggok, writing in 1922, reflects on Korea's historical relationship with China, lamenting past subservience and recent uncritical contempt. He argues for a new, informed Korean perspective, analyzing Chinese national character (seeing inner substance beneath outward slowness), politics (criticizing historical corruption and current warlord chaos), and culture (critiquing its metaphysical focus and stagnation but noting potential). Despite current turmoil, the author expresses cautious optimism for China's future resurgence due to internal awakening and changing global dynamics. Crucially, he emphasizes China's immense importance for Korea's future, particularly the Manchurian region (Tongsam Sŏng) where many Koreans reside, urging Koreans to shed past grievances, understand China realistically, foster friendship, and actively pursue economic development in Manchuria for national survival and growth.

From a historical perspective, this article is significant for revealing a nuanced Korean nationalist viewpoint during the colonial period that moves beyond simple anti-Japanese sentiment. It shows a sophisticated engagement with the complexities of China's situation and, most importantly, highlights the strategic thinking among some Koreans regarding Manchuria not just as a place of refuge but as a vital space for future national development, intertwined with both historical claims and contemporary migration realities. Historians might find the author's blend of critique and strategic engagement with China, alongside the call for Korean agency and enterprise in Manchuria, particularly interesting.

그런데 以上本性과 本質을 論함에 一見에 都是推獎的인것 가트나 長點도 勿論此에 在하거니와 더욱 現下의 大衰弱을 致한 大缺陷과 한 最古의 文明史를 둔가운대 다만 單調的으로 精神的玄學方面에 逸走하야 現代의 神學的文明의 産生을 見치못한 短處도 此에 在하니 第一長處로써 보면 調和持中의 本性을 가지며 膽液의 本質이 合致 되엇슴으로 一邊에 地理的特惠의 關係도 不無하다 하지마는 能히 他民族보다 먼저 自然과 調和하야 自己의 生活을 開拓하얏다 그리하야 持中的精神으로써 漸進步調를 取하야 自我의 發展을 對自然調和的境地內에서 圖하며 一次自己의 手로 開拓한 境地는 超越의 擴大는 못할지언정 損失은 잇게아니하랴하얏스며 무슨 換變은 업게하얏다 그 아니라 民族的隆興이 滿盛에 在한 時日에는 東洋＜50＞民族의 盟主가 되엇스며 自己의 境地로써 天下라 自稱하야 天下의 總主裁인것 가치도하얏다 그 以外에 調和的文化의 精神方面의 硏究와 發展이크다고아니할수업나니 그 過去의 偉蹟은 勿論그 本性과 本質의 所賜-라그 長處를 特히 擧하면 東亞의 大陸이면저 漢民族의 所有가 된것은 特惠的이라하지안흘수업스나 如何커나 狹窄的이 아니요 小局的이 아닌 偉大的임이요, 短期的이 아닌 持久的임이요, 虛的空的이 아닌 實的임이요, 破壞的이 아닌 建設的 成就的임이요, 殘暴的이 아닌 順柔的임이요 急見的이 아닌 消解的임이요, 雰碎的이 아닌 强靭的이다.
第二短處로써 보면 以上에 述한 本性을 가젓기문에 自然에 順調되어 그의 生活을 自然의 命令限度內에서 消極的進展은 하얏슬지언정 自我를 强히하며 基調로 하야 自然을 征服하고라도 能히 自己의 滿足을 得치못하고 自己의 所遇的境地에 順停되어 前頭에 무슨 要求를 더하지못하고 돌이어 後邊과 傍邊에 推求하야 隨遇에 安하려함이니 改進이 업고 創造가업는 그 生活은 古化가 아니고 循薦가 아니면 自盡될것 밧게업다 그럼으로 數千年의 文明의 歷史를 두엇다할지라도 一般의 思想文化가 되며 古化가 되며 虛影으로 들어가 玄學化가 되어 科學的實質文明의 産生을 見치못하얏스며 貴族的階級的其他許多虛文僞禮의 制度가 施設되어 自由와 平等의 精神이 出現치 못하얏다 一切가 一點에 固定되어 新의 産生은 勿論 더 餘地도 업거니와 古化와 循舊도그 境에 達치못하고 漸次自盡衰退의 域으로만 進케되어 最後衰弱의 權謀術數와 陰凶奸滑이그 本性本質의 純沒刻된 바도 잇섯나니 다시 그의 缺陷을 擧하면 妄自尊大的이요, 非勇進奮鬪的이요, 古化的이요, 非活潑的이요, 排外的이요, 糊塗的이요, 非明快的이다.

長處가 잇는 에 短處가 잇슬것은 勿論이다 未嘗不偉大라고 하지아니할수업는 그 民族으로써 今日에 이르러 日로 侵害와 攘奪을 當하야 最後에 弱者의 爪分의 說지앗게되는 悲觀에 處케됨은 一民族盛衰의 劫運의 所致라 할지나 民族的刷新機에 必然히 잇슬 痛苦이니넘우나그 短處에 흘러 自振의 策을 講치안흠이 惟一原의 因今이라할지나 後中國民族의 最後觀을 내린다하면 民族의 覺醒이 日로 促進됨을 보든지 時代의 進運이로 展開됨을 볼에 그 民族的復興이 確實히 잇슬것은 明若觀火의 事實이로다＜51＞
三, 政治觀
一
政治에 對하야는 現代的意味로 보지말고 中國的政治意味로 본다하면 中國은 政治純化의 國家이며 中國民은 政治單調化의 國民이며 中國의 思想文化는 政治單調化이다 一般國民의 各國가 家庭에 生活하는 以外의 事業은 모도다 政治거긔잇스며 人生의 榮譽와 勝利는 오즉 政治以外는 업다고지 思하야 國民의 最大慾望의 準的이 되며 政治 그물건은 한 最古至上으로 알아 容易히 擊得키 難한 者임을 아는 에 英雄政治, 人物政治, 神秘政治, 權謀政治, 以上의 四大의 政治가 極度의 發達을 致케되고 一般의 環境은 政治的純化이 엇지마는 平民化多數化되지 못하게되어 天生의 英雄이 아니면안된다 權謀의 術略을 가지지안흐면안된다 神秘的奸滑의 手段이업스면안된다하얏다 그리하야 如何한 不正當한 際會와 手段으로써 그 位를 得한 者는 無上의 光榮으로 알아 良心에 沒却되며 正義에 違反되는 百方의 鬼鬼崇崇의 手段을 弄하야 自我의 慾望을 滿充케 함에는 무엇도 辭치안핫다그러나 政治에 魔醉된 人衆은 그 權謀의 手段의 智를 讚키마지안핫스니 人生의 究竟目的은 所謂그 政治及做官에 잇는 것이며 目的道程은 오즉그 以外에 업다고 思함이엇다 科擧의 制度가 産生된 後 科擧에 應하는 者 所謂文人級이 엇는데 文人級은 國民의 各級中最高級이요 그의 最高慾望은 곳 登科做官이엇다 如斯한 制度下에서는 一般國民이 做官의 單調化가 되지안흘수업스며 中國民의 常用語인 升官發財라는 말만들어보아도 官은 即錢이요 即은 富榮요 譽解라고 釋國케 되어 民一의 生努力이 做官에 잇는 에 곳 此의 專門이엇다이의 專門에서 不遇를 當한 者는 勿論憤慨의 心理下에서도 그러러니와 는 飢寒에도 如何히 할수업시 所謂英雄盜가 産出케 되니 現時中國의 最苦痛인 餉馬賊도그 一種이라 할수잇스며그 不平의 徒의 擾亂이 恒常不絶하야 一般의 國民은 混沌과 衰弱의 境에 處케되엇나니가론 政治的中傷이요 政治的罪惡이라함이라
二
爲先近年의 史를 觀하면 滿洲의 愛親覺羅氏가 中原의 大陸을 占據케 되자 그의 本志가 原中國民即漢族의 政治的文化的其他各般을 改善하자하는 것보다 純然히 自族의 發展을 圖하기문에 漢族을 順奴隷視하야왓다하야도 過言이아니다 그런데그 以前에 蒙古族의 元國이 統治함에도 漢族은 그냥 順受 하얏거니와이가티 異族의 征服＜52＞을 밧는 에도 넘우나 調和的本性을 가진 漢族은 無恥의 그 壓迫을 바닷슬만이아니라 오히려 做官의 慾望은 족음도 減少치 아니하야 做官하는 에는 政治的本意는 純然히 沒却하고 可能만 잇다하면 如何한 罪惡에 犯함도 辭치아니하얏다 그 心理가 一邊에 異族의 元朝나 淸朝의 政治를 惡化한다는 點에 그런다고도할지나 그는 곳 自害自損이엇나니 一般國民이 그의 惡政治에 더욱 中傷되어 더욱 現下의 政治的大文亂을 致케되는 動機가 此에도 伏在타할수잇다 伊來革命이 일어난 後 革命的革命이 아니고 以前洪秀全反亂後의 餘威를 가지며 는 歐風이 東漸하자 一般의 思想과 心理가 一變되며 그 以外에 그 政治的中傷의 心理下에서 英雄盜的主義者의 一部響應이 잇서 風聲鶴唳的으로 辛亥年에 이르러 旬月의 間에 革命이 成立되엇스나 英雄盜的主義下에 跳梁하는 袁世凱의 跋扈가 革命의 神聖을 侮瀆하얏스며 又는 一時的超出의 黃興孫逸仙이가 잇다할지라도 一般國民의 革命에 對根한 本覺悟가 업슴에 因하야 事實上畵虎難成이 되고말앗스며그 反面에 腐敗한 中에서라도 國民을 統御하는 舊政治지 外面的으로 根本破壞되고 보니 於是乎進退難谷의 大困難에 處케되며 民族的大混沌期에 들어가게되니가론 今日의 現狀이라 그리하야 共和니 平等이니 하는 外皮는 씻슬지언정 內面으로 족음도 改進이 업고 舊그대로잇서더구나 一般國民의 政治的即做官慾은 더 增漲케 되엇는데그 外皮는 돌이어 做官發財的野慾을 充함에 만흔 便宜를 줄기언정 一般國民의 現代政治에 對한 意識은 족음도나흔것이업다 이에서 不流不塞하고 不進不退하야 前後左右에 如何히 할수업는 最旋渦에 停滯하야 그가 온대 百鬼가 出沒하고 怪狀이 萬千인 別態를 이루어 英雄盜的一時有勢力者即督軍의 專橫期가 되어마치 六國時代의 羣雄割據와 다름이업게되엇다 그럼으로 甲乙의 相爭乙丙의 相鬪가 經年에 그칠 日이 無하고 合縱의 術이 無時不行하야 直皖의 戰爭과 奉直의 戰爭이 가장 明顯한 事實이요그 以外에 督軍의 爭奪, 地盤, 勢力, 黨派의 紛爭이곳 連續이엇다 直皖奉直의 大戰이 잇다하면 勝敗가 논후인 後에 勝者가 能히 其後를 善케할 方策과 能力이 업다 何故오 하면 利害를 爲하야 原來信義가 薄弱한 그이들은 朝梁暮楚에 反覆無常일더러아츰의 讎仇가 저녁의 親友가 될수잇스며 失敗者는 失敗리 勝者를 爲하야 陰謀한다 그러고 본즉 勝敗가 無常이요 是非가 不分이다 다시말하면 今番奉直戰으로 본다하면 奉波가 敗하자 直派의 專橫有은 政府니 中央이니 하는 것도모도다 直派의 專有며 奉波는 한 復讎를 圖키마지아니하야 皖派가 付和되＜53＞며 南方派와 聯絡하며 其他不平派英雄盜派가 雷同되어 其勢가 終日 마치지 못할 迫勢가 보인즉 압흐로 如何한 慘劇이 일어날는지 預料할 수 업스며 한 그 勢力의 爭鬪에 如何히 할수업시 各軍力家는 日로 自己의 軍隊를 擴充키 마지아니하야 비록 無能한 軍隊라 할지라도 中國南北方을 合하야 數百萬以上에 超過하나니 이 軍隊야 말로 國家와 人民을 爲하야는 損은 잇슬지언정 利는 업는 것이며 各督軍의 勢力助長과 護身符에 不過한 것이다 그이아니라 軍餉의 缺乏에 因한 各處의 兵變이며 는 解退하면 英雄盜的馬賊밧게되는 것이업다 그 政治裏面의 眞相은 참으로다 叙述한다 할수업스며 以上의 一端을 見하야 可히 어느 程度지짐작할것이다

그런데 다시한번생각할것은 現下에 이가티 奇怪萬狀의 大混沌期에 잇서 存亡을 未判하는 墳에지이르럿다할지나 이가튼 大民族으로그의 大轉換期에 잇서 어느 點으로는 참으로 免치못할바 過程이며 政治的 中傷後의 必然히 잇슬바 缺陷이다 그이아니라 各政客軍人의 互相跳梁은 곳 自體의 自盡淘汰를 意味함이니 그리하야 新時代的新人物이 出現할 것이다 近年來의 一般의 新文化運動의 熱中이며 社會改造運動의 號呌가자못 新中國建設의 機를 催促하나니그는 確實히 第二革命運動의 繼續이라 中華民國六年學生의 對官僚及排日의 五月四日運動이 처음으로그 機를 보엿스며한 進展의 一步이다이리하야 一邊에 純無治論도 不無하나 現代的新政治의 出現이잇스려한다
三, 文化觀
一
西京의 文化가 現代를 統制하야 獨占의 觀이 不無하나 東京文化의 存在認치아니할수업는 에 東京文化에 大有力者인 中國民에 對하야 文化的民族이라고하지안흘수업다 한 世界最古文明의 發源地의 一임이 事實인에 文化的能力이 富함도 認할수잇다 그러나 現代觀으로 보면 新文化的民族이라고는 할수업다 그만아니라 古代觀으로 본다할지라도 獨權的 特級的의 一部의 文化的民族이라고는 할지언정 共權的平級的文化가 普逼되엇다고할수업슬지라
무릇 文化란 무엇이뇨 生活的樣式의 表現이다 한 生活이란 무엇이뇨 民衆의 本性과 本質에 基한 行爲와 動作이다 그럼으로 그 民族的環境에 對한 多少의 支配變換되는 點이 不無타 할지라도 東洋人은 그 本性에 基한 生活과＜54＞文化가 有하며 西洋人은 그 本性에 基한 生活과 文化가 잇다 아울러 中國人은 그 本性과 本質에 基한 生活과 文化가 잇슬것이다 딸하 中國民은 그 本性質에 基한 調和的의 持中的의 生活과 文化가 잇서왓다 調和的持中的에서 流出한 文化는 如何한 意義와 特性을 가젓슬가 爲先中國의 歷史와 現下民衆의 生活의 反影을 察하야 可히알것이러니와 中國民은 第一着自家의 生活을 開拓할부터 單純히 自然에 順應하며 自然에 聽하야 天命을 待하는 것으로 唯一의 信條가 되며 비록 如何한 自我의 慾望과 要求가 잇다할지라도 敢히 自然에 拒抗하며 自然을 征服하야 奮鬪猛進치 못하얏다 그럼으로 一般의 文化는 오즉 順自然聽自然에서 盛熱되어 究竟의 極致가 調和的에 至할것이엇다 그리하야 形而上的方面의 玄學이 極度의 發展을 遂케되는 에 그 目標는 實로무삼 預定과 指點이 업시오 즉 絶大神秘와 絶對至難에 付하고 個中에 무슨 實이잇고업슴을 不拘하고 探索하기로만 힘쓰고사람 自體를 나 自然 그 물건에 무엇을 미드며 追求하야 人生은 돌이어 沒却視하며 罪惡視하야 自然을 假하야곳 自我를 征服하랴하얏다 그런 中에 더욱 仙學은 最後에 純然히 自然 그대로를 主張하야 무슨 文化이니 生活이니하는 人生의 諸般行爲를 非難함에 지 至하얏고 中國文化의 中心이된다는 孔學으로 볼지라도 仙學과 如히 根本的으로 人生問題에 對하야 絶對의 主張은 아니하얏다할지라도 諸般의 論法이 恒常人生을 넘우 直眼視하야 虛文과 僞禮로ㅆ拘束하랴고는 만히힘썻나니 一邊에 貢獻도 업다고는 할수업스나 그의 害毒도 업다고는 할수업스니 人生의 本能을 根本부터 無視하야 一般思想的道徑을 形而上學的方面으로 虛空化하랴 하얏슬만이아니라 人生의 文化와 生活에 多少留意가 잇섯다하면 一切를 어느 方法下에 拘束만 하랴하얏스며 絶對의 階級的, 絶對의 貴族으로 君子와 小人의 別을 說하야 所謂君子라야만 所謂孔子의 生平에 說한 堯舜의 道를 알수잇스며 小人은 絶對로 미치지못함을 明言하다십히하야 文化의 그물건은 君子의 專有物로 稀世의 實처럼 一二人의 가질바요 斷然히 普遍치 못할바이라 思하얏다그 以外에 恒常唐虞三代의 治를 說하야 一般의 人衆으로 하야곰 舊를 義케하며 古를 慕케하야 古化케 함이니이는 民族的致命傷을 주는 것일만이아니라 孔學以後의 中國文化는 漸次退步케 됨이라이러함으로 人衆은 古化하려고 努力하는 道中에 退化케 되엇스며 文化는 古化하려함에서 停滯되고 말엇다그리하야그 古化의 最終이곳 今日의 中國民의 現態이다
二＜55＞
如斯히 再言하면 文化는 古化的에서 純然히 靜心의 狀態에 잇는 中 더욱 階級的特權的又는 至高至難的이엇슴으로 千의 一이나 萬의 一이 그를 배워보려하얏고 그 以外는 그로부터 落伍되어 더말할무슨 價値도 업게되엇다 그럼으로 現代中國民의 文化的程度가 넘우나 懸隔되어잇슴이 곳그것이요 一로써 千이나 萬을 當할수업는 에 一見에 一般國民이 文化的意識이업게도보인다 한 生活의 狀態를 보면 文化的反影에 依하야 可히 推斷하려니와 孔學이 一切文化나 生活의 中心이 된가운대 一切生活의 基礎는 그 階級的貴族的의 制度下에서 家長主義로부터 비롯케되어 天高地卑乾坤定矣라는 主觀에서 男女의 高下를 絶對로 判定하고 一切家庭의 權威를 男子의 專有케 하고 經濟로말하면 先天的宿命觀에 依한 福이라는 對象下에 富라는 것을 人人의 다가티못할바임을 말하얏슬이아니라 經濟에 對하야는 純然히 閒却視하얏다하여도 可하다그럼으로 天惠의 富源이 目前에 在하되 此를 開發키를 努力하지 아니하얏고 貧富의 懸隔이 더욱 甚하게되엇다 그럼으로 一切가 다 사람으르는 聖者가아니면곳大愚이요 經濟로 보면大富가아니면곳大貧이다 聖者와 大富는 極少數언에 國民의 全體로 보면 大愚와 大貧이라하야도 可하게되엇다 以上에 述한 바 古代觀을 說한 것가트나 곳 現下의 現態이다 革命이 일어나며 民國이 成立되며 新文化에 接觸된 後에도 一般國民은 思키를 文化의 運動이나 其他 무엇은 一個의 聖者나 大富가 할바이요 各個의 다할바이아니라하며 더욱 持中的保守의 特性을 가젓슴으로 因하야 容易히 新文化에 接觸되려하지도안으며 恒常大中國이라는 妄自尊大의 念이 心頭에 박혀잇스며 西洋人은 洋鬼子라 其他外人은 무엇이라하야 自誇의 懸念이 强烈하다 다시말하면차라리 時代의 落伍者가 될지언정 自家舊有의 文化와 生活의 本色은 居然히 棄脫치아니하려한다 그러나 新文化에는 이미 接觸이 되어온가운대 一般의 覺悟도 漸次생겻거니와 女性의 發達은 古代에 잇서도 多少間만흔 發揮가 잇서온가운대 더욱 近來로 男性以上의 發達을 致하얏다하여도 可하며 一般의 進步는 快速치는 못하나마 緩進的으로 經來한 中한 過剩의 懸異를 生케됨은 古文化的意識으로부터 根本의 錯誤를 突破치 못하얏슴이라 例하면 高等의 學者와 著書는 有하되 通俗의 著作은 업슴이며 湖省議會에는 女議員이 엇스되 他省에는 女權運의 動의 動機도업슴이다
三
如何커나 自家의 舊有의 文化로써 現代的生活을 하려함은 未便이라는 것보다 그동안만흔 痛苦와 遭難을 격는 ＜56＞點에서 비롯오 覺悟하야가는 道中에 在하다 新文化에 接觸되기는 東洋人으로도 가장 最先이 엇지마는 而今것 무슨 큰 發展이 업게됨은 그의 保守的本性이한 魔障이되엇슴도 事實이러니와그의 根本的徹底한 覺悟가 업시한갓 參用한다는 것과 調和한다는 데서 失敗되고말이엇다 而今에 世界的學者와 世界的偉人이업슴도 아니며 한 一部에 큰 施設이 업슴도아니나 普遍的이 아니요 오히려 特級的이 되어잇슴으로 眞正한 文化的意味下에서 무슨 價値를 認할수업다 그러나 最近來로 一般社會의 運動이 新文化에 만히 憧憬하며 接觸되려한다 日日의 發展된 程度로써 보면 참으로 平昔에 比할배아니요 蔚然의 可觀할 點이잇다이리하야 中國民의 全體가 新文化에 한번 接觸되는 에 東西文化의 調和的文明의 産出이 잇슬줄아노라
四, 中國今後觀

中國의 問題는 이미 世界的大問題가 되엇다 하 中國今後의 如何는 곳 世界的에 如何의 大關係를 주는 바이다 그럼으로 中國今後에 對한 外人의 注視가 緊切라고 하지안흘수업다 그런데 各個의 觀察이 從來로 가장 錯雜한 中歐戰일어나기 前에는 事實上悲觀論이 多數히 엇스며 直接으로 爪分과 呑食을 主張하얏스나 그 後 歐戰이 終結되며 帝國軍國兩時代가 가자 以上의 直接의 主張은 多少軟解되엇슬더러 中國民의 進步를 觀하야 一部의 樂觀派나 助援派가 잇스나 依然히 共管說이 存在한 模樣이로되 時代轉換은 確實히 中國으로 하야곰 最後滅亡에 지는 이르지안흘것이한 事實이라 而今에는 爪分도 不可能이요 獨呑도 不可能이요 對外의 强者는 如何히 할수업시 傍觀할수 밧게업스며 한 助援치 안흐면안되는 境遇에 在하다 何故오 하면 流血과 生命을 犧牲하야 그의 野慾을 貧하랴할 者도업슬만이아니라 잇다할지라도 大勢上如何히 할수업나니 이야말로 時代의 進運이며 環境의 空氣이다

現時對外列强의 中國에 對한 態度를 略觀하면서로 中立하야 一個强者가 侵呑할 意思가 잇다하면 서로 阻止하랴는거밧게업스며 이에서 機會의 均等이며 門戶의 開放이라는 方策下에 中國民의 心理를 서로이 買好하야 産業的利益이나 享受하려고 平和的手段으로 努力하는 것밧게업다 그럼으로 巴里會議며 華盛頓會議가 究竟에는 一部或全部가 對中國問題의 討議인데 決局은 彼我의 均等下에서 中國을 助援하자하게된것이다 하 中國의 對＜57＞外的恐怖와 危險은 만히 減少되엇다할수잇스며 而今에는 오즉 自身問題인데 現下에 비록 오히려 大危險大混沌期에 잇다할지라도 이미 滅亡의 境에서는 벗어낫다함은 先言 한바와 如히 大勢上으로 보면 左右의 무슨 掣肘가 업시 能히 自振할수 잇게되엇다 이의 瞬間이 中國民의 新生面을 展開하는 始點이라 할수잇다 이에서 最後의 紛亂이 一見에 더욱 混沌으로 驅入되는 것가트나 確實히 新의 出現의 動機이다 最近에 奉直戰의 內訌이잇는 것이든가 內閣의 無定이라든가 財政의 最後紊亂이라든가 閙餉風潮가 日로 激甚함이라든가 過剩軍人의 兵變이라든가 모도다그의 自體淘汰의 最後的跋扈이다 如斯히그 裡面에 國民的自覺은 日로 向上되며 一般新的運動의 激烈은 一層그 度를 加하야 將次그 機를 바라보고잇나니 그 中顯著한 者는 學界의 蔡元培一派의 「데모크래시」的運動이며 陳獨秀一派의 社會主義的運動이며 政治界로는 陳烱明一派의 聯省自治運動이다 이로써보면넘우나 夥多한 民衆 는 從來로 文化的程度가 넘우나 懸隔하얏슴에 因하야 그의 刷新이 快速라고는 할수업스나 그의 可能性이잇스며 한 調和持中의 本性이잇는 中國民은 一次新文化에 對한 完全한 覺悟를 엇는 는 能히그 新文化에 消解할지오 建設함이잇스리라 斷言하리로다그러면 中國의 今後는 時代의 進展으로보든지 對外의 環境으로보든지 自體의 能性으로보든지 이미큰 危險에 벗어나 自振할길노리를 發見하엿다할수잇는 에 樂觀을 許치안흘수업스나 此가 勿論容易에 付할바도아니려니와 速한 期間內에서는 그 自振의 業이 完成되리라고는 할수업다
五, 朝鮮對中國觀
一
中國에 對한 나의 淺觀은 以上과 如히 簡單히 發表하얏스며 아울러 論評的으로 中國今後觀을 論케됨에 世界對中國, 中國對世界의 關係를 述하야만흔 樂觀을 許하야노핫다 그런데마즈막 朝鮮對中國觀을 스스로의 만흔느낌에서 短見과 淺論을 한번써보려하얏다 朝鮮對中國의 關係는 過去에는 더말할것업거니와 現在와 將來에 누구보다도무엇보다도 가장 緊切한 關聯이되어잇슴은 누구나 否認치 못할바이다 그런데 中國에 對한 우리 朝鮮人의 眞正한 批判이잇서왓는가 以上叙言에 略及한 바와 如히 純然한 無條件의 茨慕와 妄崇이잇섯스며 最近에는 過去의 關係로 因한 一種의 憤慨下에 反對하얏스며 非難하얏다 그러나 切實한 見地下에서 朝鮮對中國의 問題를 過現及將來를 勿論하고 一時的新聞雜誌에서나마 批判하야＜58＞보앗스며 發議하야보앗는가 참으로 우리의 넘우나 無意識함을 感치안흘수업다 過去에 無條件하고 中國民의 征服한 배되어 此에서 民族的大衰弱을 맛난다하면 참으로 等閒히 看過할바가아니며는 東省一帶가 自家祖先의 汗血로 開拓한 疆域이엇스며 아울러 最近來自家의 數百萬人衆이 移住하야 無如故土回復과 如히되엇스며 現在에 祖國의 自立運動의 策源地가되다십히되어잇슬만이아니라 其他諸般의 關係로도 우리 朝鮮人에게 民族的發展의 意思와 新生命延長의 理想이잇다하면 참으로 忽諸에 付할바가아니다 그러면나는 이에 對한 무슨 切實한 見地가잇서이럼도아니다 그러나우리 一般이 今後로는 此에 對한 社會的問題를 促起하야 切實히 硏究하야보게함이외다 爲先現勢觀으로써 하면 第一은 地理的關係이며 第二는 現代朝鮮民族的環境의 自發的如何히할수업는 關係이니 第一의 關係로써보면 所謂現時의 境界를 볼지라도 一葦의 帶水에 隔한 咫尺의 地가 兩國의 界線이되어잇슬만이아니라 그 界線의 彼岸이곳 自家祖先의 舊疆인 點에서 民族的發展을 圖코저하면 必然히그 彼岸으로 進行치아니할수업슴이요 第二의 關係로는 現下에 自家的環境이 窮程에 至케됨에 諸般이 如何히할수업는 最後的道程에서그 彼岸에 來치안흘수업게되엇다 以上의 兩必然的關係가 곳 現下의 最切한 大問題이다 此가우리 朝鮮人의 避하랴야 避할수업는 境遇의 一이라하면 自進하야그 問題의 解決을 謨함이 事業의 一이다 한 此가 朝鮮人에게 利라할지언정 損이라할수업스며 中國人에게도큰 害損의 關係는 업다할지니 그러면 此의 關係를 善히 擁護하야 自家發展의 길을 失錯하지못할지라 그럼으로그의 問題를 우리 社會의 共同討論에 付하야 爲先硏究의 勞도 積하려니와 過去에 對한 憤慨의 念을 姑捨하고는 外人의 輕侮觀에 雷同치말고 切實한 理解下에서 그로부터 좀 深刻한 理想的企圖下에서 爲先朝中親睦을 圖할 施設을 遂하야 朝中의 關係를 增進할지오는 自體의 事業으로 東省一帶에 在한 旣住同胞의 應援함이니 第一着相當한 經濟及實業의 施設을 起始하야 一邊에 移住를 勸獎할것이오 一邊에 旣住同胞의 經濟的助援을 주어야할것이다 過去에 이 問題를 提到하는 者는 事實上浮浪漢＜59＞이아니면 詐欺者의 跳梁으로이 事業에 對한 魔障이 적지아니하얏슴으로 一般企業家의 觀念을 만히 冷哲케하얏스나 此가 朝鮮民族의 事業的適地라하면 비록 一二次의 失敗가잇다할지라도 自進하야 努力치안흘수업다 다시 正當한 立地와 確固한 預算下에서 再히 努力한다하면 勿論預料의 成効를 齋來할것이다 不然하면 우리는 우리의 福源을 스스로 棄抛함이다 일로부터 우리 社會의 共同的經營의 事業아 速하 着手키를 바라노라
付記이름은 크게 朝鮮對中國之今後關係이라고하얏스나 內容은 實로 虛弱케 되엇습니다 이는 時間의 制裁도 업지안커니와 뒤로밀우는 懈怠에서이러케되엇스며 나의 渡華한 後日記中에서 摘來하야 爲先이 問題를 근드려보앗는데 讀者의 厚諒을 바랄이외다
