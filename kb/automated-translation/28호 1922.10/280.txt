Artists of the Koguryŏ Period / — A Historical Study of Korean Artists………(Seven)

Third: Artists of the Koguryŏ Period

Art is not a profession; it is not a profession that seeks remuneration through money. An artist does not produce creations for longevity and fame but only follows the mysterious demands of the self. Moreover, in ancient times when the population was sparse, concerns such as the hardships of life were likely outside the consideration of artists. Therefore, general society did not mind forgetting artists; they valued creations as the effort of a society or a group rather than the creation of an individual. Since the general ideal was already like this, how could one expect the precedence of artists to be passed down?

It goes without saying that artistic relics and artifacts from the Koguryŏ period are rare. That they could not escape imperfect preservation methods not only proves that the artifacts were regarded casually but also shows that they were treated with the notion that they were merely ordinary ancient objects. Although it might not have been unthinkable to attach aesthetic value and transmit their preciousness to myriad generations for the sake of posterity, such efforts were rather weak. Since this was the case with artifacts and relics, it is unsurprising that the names of artists were also not transmitted.

Although Koguryŏ's policy aimed for the parallel practice of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism (仙敎), what the people's hearts adhered to was solely Buddhism. Consequently, Buddhism, which had the closest relationship with art among the three teachings, flourished, leading to the great rise of Buddhist art. Generally, monks practiced diligence and simplicity, upholding frugality, so their daily lives had not even a moment of leisure; thus, not shirking the labor of artistic production, their skill in it was also a characteristic feature. That is, in ancient times when Buddhism <16> prospered, monks also served as artists. Of course, without some consideration of Buddhist doctrines and history, even an artist would find it difficult to create Buddhist artworks, and appreciation would also struggle to grasp the true essence thereof.

If so, are there transmissions of monks as artists? Setting aside artists, are there even transmissions of monks? They can be counted on one's fingers. However, our history concerns itself with recording conflicts, transmitting the use of monks as spies for strategic purposes or describing the arrival and assimilation of Chinese monks (沙門), while regarding those who fostered Buddhism in neighboring lands, building a brilliant culture, and also concerning such facts, it would not be an overstatement to say that we have truly not seen anything recorded. No matter how fiercely devastating battles continued month after month, and the rise and fall of nations alternated year after year, even if records were occasionally lost or damaged during the Middle Ages, relying on China or Japan for facts about our own country's past makes one hesitant to obtain the truth. However, since it is not extremely difficult for us to infer from these records and conjecture that they were even more transcendent beings, I hereby intend to discuss Tamjing (曇徵) from those historical accounts and contemplate the artists of the Koguryŏ period whose transmissions are non-existent.

Tamjing (曇徵)

Although Buddhism in Japan (扶桑) was first transmitted from Paekche, monks (沙門) from Koguryŏ also occupied a superior position. Monk Hyeja (釋惠慈), in the fifth month of the fifth year of King Yŏngyang of Koguryŏ, crossed over to Japan, where Crown Prince Toyotomimi (豊聰, Shōtoku) became his disciple. He propagated the Buddhist law, becoming a pillar of the Three Treasures. Monk Hyegwan (釋慧灌), in the first month of the seventh year of King Yŏngnyu of Koguryŏ, crossed over, founded Inoue-dera (井上寺) in Kawachi, and began lecturing on the Three Treatises (三論), thus becoming the founder of the Sanron sect (三論宗) in Japan. Besides these, there were not a few monks who transmitted the Way; the Tamjing whom we intend to discuss here is one of them. The *Honchō Kōsōden* (本朝高僧傳 - Biographies of Eminent Japanese Monks) states:

> Monk Tamjing (釋曇徵), in the third month, spring of the 18th year of Empress Suiko [610 CE], came as tribute from the state of Koryŏ (高麗). He was widely learned in external studies (secular learning), proficient in the Five Classics, and also possessed artistic skills. He was skilled in making millstones (碾磑) and color painting (彩畵). At that time, this court [Japan] was not yet proficient in painting, so they received instruction from Tamjing.

His extensive wisdom and profound knowledge enabled him to master secular learning and the Five Classics, and furthermore, possessing extraordinary skills, he transmitted the marvelous techniques of color painting (彩畵), which did not exist in Japan. The *Nihon Shoki* (日本書紀) says:

> In the second month of the 18th year of Empress Suiko [610 CE], the King of Koryŏ sent the monks Tamjing (曇徵) and Pŏpchŏng (法定) as tribute. Tamjing knew the Five Classics, and was also skilled in making pigments (彩色) and paper and ink (紙墨), as well as constructing millstones (碾磑). It is said that the construction of millstones began at this time. <17>

Thus, it was not that so-called calligraphy and painting were not esteemed previously, but they were primarily ink wash painting (水墨畵) or considered an amateur pursuit of literati. Adding the five colors of Tanch'ŏng (丹靑) was immediately deemed vulgar, given a special name, and practically rejected. Following blindly the detrimental legacy of traditional Confucian ways, it might not be entirely absent among us that if someone were skilled in making colors (彩色) and producing paper and ink (紙墨), their character might be viewed with suspicion. Indeed, concerning culture, especially matters of technical skill, the historian's brush was not lifted. Even inferring from the fact that Tamjing, a master of abundant learning, has no mention in our historical texts, it is unknown whether there were countless superior painters within the country, but one must consider the absolute lack of records regarding general crafts.

Tamjing the artist of Koguryŏ was Monk Tamjing (釋曇徵), Tamjing the craftsman (工人), Tamjing the painter (畵家), and Tamjing the sculptor (彫刻師); this was the common practice in the Koguryŏ period. That is, even in the ancient times of our country, it was also a characteristic feature that the painter and the sculptor were combined in the same person. As there are no other distinct historical records concerning Tamjing besides this, I will add no further superfluous remarks and instead attempt to study him based on his works.

The murals of the Golden Hall (金堂壁畵) at Hōryū-ji (法隆寺) in Japan are masterpieces rare in East or West, contributing greatly to the high value of the Golden Hall. However, those who have discussed them since antiquity have not definitively identified the artist. Some, believing misattributions in works like the *Kokon Mokuroku Shō* (古今目錄抄) or *Shichidaiji Nikki* (七大寺日記), claim they are by the painter Tori (畵師鳥). However, this is said to be because they failed to examine the inscription on the halo of the Shaka Triad statue (釋迦三尊像) inside the hall, which identifies it as a sculpture by Tori Busshi (鳥佛師). Although the features of the Buddha statue—long eyebrows, narrow eyes, and a straight, high nose bridge, expressing a majestic air—might share some similarities, how could the skillful and elegant composition of the murals, with their fluid yet gentle lines and profound yet subtle colors, be attributed to Tori Busshi, the creator of the Shaka Triad statue? Though Tori Busshi was renowned as an ancient sculptor, he does not reach the level of being called a painter. It is perhaps natural that the public doubts the unknown authorship. Here, I intend to argue that this is the surviving work of Tamjing.

(One) The Japanese Painting World Before Tamjing's Arrival: During the reign of Emperor Yūryaku of Japan (日本雄略帝時代, c. 470 CE), painters began crossing over from Paekche, leading to the first use of the term *Ebe* (畵部, Painter's Guild). Subsequently, following the transmission of Buddhism, painters like Paekka (白如) and Asa (阿佐) also arrived one after another. Thus, the Japanese painting world, previously childish like child's play and hardly worth discussing, reached a point of opening a new aspect through their special protection and encouragement. However, painting at that time had still not escaped the realm of ink wash painting (墨畵). The brilliant application of color (賦彩) seen in later periods was not practiced. Therefore, it could not avoid being a dark age, undeveloped in terms of painting.

(Two) Tamjing's Accomplishments: Tamjing, a man of Koguryŏ who possessed world-encompassing spirit, crossed the East Sea once and reached the island nation of Japan. As a monk <18>, he naturally propagated the Buddhist law, but he also transmitted the methods for making pigments (彩色) and paper and ink (紙墨). In the painting world of that time, which was unskilled in painting, color painting (彩色畵) was first learned from Tamjing. Observing this, one can imagine the favorable treatment he received from the people of the time, and further, it is ample grounds to infer that he was the painter of the murals. Indeed, historical records clearly state that Tamjing resided together with Pŏpchŏng (法定) at Hōryū-ji. The *Heishi Taishiden* (平氏太子傳 - Biography of Prince Shōtoku) states:

> In the third month of the 18th year of Empress Suiko, the year Kengō [庚午, 610 CE], the Koryŏ monks Tamjing (曇徵) and Pŏpchŏng (法定), two individuals, came. (omission) The Prince [Shōtoku] ordered, saying, "Monks (法師等), you have arrived late. You should reside in my temple." He then placed them in Hōryū-ji. End quote.

Tamjing, having agreed to the request of the temple's founder, Prince Shōtoku (聖德太子), resided at Hōryū-ji just a few years after its construction was completed. It is therefore quite fitting that he painted the murals.

Regarding the extant murals of the Hōryū-ji Golden Hall, I wish to comment briefly, albeit from my humble perspective, on their general composition and technique, and thereby contemplate the great, genius-like personality of our great artist Tamjing. The murals consist of the Four Buddha Pure Land paintings (四佛淨土圖) painted on the four large walls and the Bodhisattva paintings (菩薩圖) painted on the eight small walls (two in each of the four corners of the hall). The Hōshō Jōsatsu-zu (寶生淨刹圖 - Ratnasaṃbhava's Pure Land) on the east wall, compared to the other three walls, has a very weak composition, and its lines are also withered, indicating it is not from the same period; that is, it was damaged during a disaster in the Middle Ages and later remade. Therefore, among Tamjing's works, the other three walls remain. Although some color restoration might have occurred, the Shaka Kokushi-zu (釋迦國士圖 - Shakyamuni's Pure Land) on the west side of the north wall has suffered the most flaking, making the painted surface sparse. Thus, the completely preserved ones today are the Amida Jōdo-zu (阿彌陀淨土圖 - Amitābha's Pure Land) on the west wall and the Yakushi Jōdo-zu (藥師刹土圖 - Bhaiṣajyaguru's Pure Land) on the east side of the north wall. The central figure on the west wall sits on a lotus pedestal, raising both hands in the gesture of preaching, flanked by painted standing images of the attendant Bodhisattvas Kannon (觀音) and Seishi (勢至). The central figure of the Yakushi Pure Land painting sits enthroned on a lion seat (獅子座), raising the right hand and placing the left hand on the knee, attended by four Bodhisattvas, two monks (比丘), the Four Heavenly Kings (四天), etc., on the left and right. Their facial expressions and postures are elegant, serene, majestic, and graceful. The central figures are fully clothed, not showing the Indian style of a bare right shoulder. The numerous realistic drapery folds (裕紋) accompanying them exhibit the Gandhara (간다라) style from the Western Regions. Furthermore, as seen in the Yakushi image, the slight exposure of the right chest area due to the raised right hand, and the revelation of the undergarment (襯衣) on the left knee supporting the left hand due to the divided folds of the robe (裳襞), show a departure from the old rut of conventional Mannerism (만나리즘) based on the thirty-two auspicious signs (三十二相式). The natural undergarment (襯衣) of the Amitābha on the west wall displays masterful shading (暈染法) with free gradations of light and dark. The gentle hands in the preaching mudra surpass detailed realistic depiction; the spiritual resonance (靈韻) filling the entire body comes alive. This does not arise merely from the symmetrical beauty and formal beauty of the composition (up, down, left, right) but truly possesses an intrinsic religious beauty, further achieving liberation from its constraints. It is indeed the outpouring of the painter Tamjing's devout faith and longing <19>, an expression of his entire self. He truly reached a realm of unique creativity.

These murals were made by coating the entire wall surface with white clay (白土), outlining the forms with lines (線條), and adding color using black ink (墨), cinnabar (朱), yellow (黃), blue (靑), red (紅), and green (綠). The cool colors of blue and green (靑綠) envelop the warm colors of cinnabar and yellow (朱黃), evoking a sense of tranquility. The attendant Bodhisattvas wearing jeweled crowns adorned with emeralds and gold (翠玉金飾) have dazzling five-colored chest ornaments (胷飾) and bracelets (腕環). Their upper bodies are mostly bare, generally wearing a Kasaya (袈裟) draped from the left shoulder under the right armpit, hanging down from both sides to form a half-moon shape. Around their half-twisted waists, they wear thin silk robes (羅衣), through which both legs are clearly visible. The gestures of their hands and the harmony between the upper and lower body progress from a rhythmically flowing beauty of the nude form (裸體美) to signify liberation from reality, allowing one to imagine the bliss of the Pure Land realm, transcending the defilements of the five poisons (五獨). The expression of pure meditation and benevolent majesty are truly products of Tamjing's sincere spiritual life. One can imagine his personality and further appreciate the essential aspirations and ideals of the Koguryŏ people in formative art.

The brushwork (筆法) of the murals shows no particular difference from what is still transmitted today, but the application of the shading technique (陰影法), unseen in other paintings of the time, was initiated here. This also constitutes a major characteristic of these murals. It is most evident in the drapery folds (𧛸紋 - read as 褶紋) of the central figures, and even the lotus pedestal (蓮花座) has gradations meticulously added to create a sense of concavity and convexity (凹凸). For the Bodhisattvas, the forms are outlined with red lines (朱線), and shading is applied with red (朱) to indicate the rise and fall of the facial features and musculature.

This shading method (陰影法) recalls the Four Gods murals (四神圖) of the Kangso Three Tombs (江西三墓); the color tone gradually becomes lighter moving from the outline towards the center. Although somewhat different from today's chiaroscuro (明暗描寫), it is comparable to the way a specialized technician might depict grapes. Thus, discovering and gathering similarities between the *mitsuda-e* (密陀繪) painting on the shrine (厨子) inside the hall, the phoenixes (鳳凰) on the ceiling, and the murals inside Koguryŏ tombs is also convenient for tracing their lineage.

Tamjing was a person of the King Yŏngyang era of Koguryŏ. This was after the tombs we have explored were already built in various places. He must have inherited the developed painting style tradition and further seems to have been influenced by Southern Dynasties [Chinese] brushwork (南卞筆法).

King Sŏng of Paekche (百濟聖王) sent envoys to the Liang dynasty (梁) requesting artisans (工匠) and painters (畵師). Since this event occurred about sixty years later, there must have been considerable connection with the Liang painting style of that time. The signboard (扁額) of I-ch'eng-ssu Temple (一乘寺) in Chien-k'ang (健康), said to be a surviving work of Zhang Sengyou (張僧繇) of Liang, was called Aotu-ssu (凹凸寺 - Concave-Convex Temple) because its floral patterns were said to retain Western techniques (西域之法), and when viewed from afar, the painted surface seemed to have concavities and convexities (凹凸). This also shows that the shading/wash technique (暈染法) was already practiced. His invention, the "boneless" wrinkle method (沒骨皺)<20>, was so named because it was painted using the wash technique (暈染法) rather than relying solely on outlines (線條).

In the Golden Hall murals as well, the fact that distinct linear beauty (線條美) alone is not prioritized due to the use of color wash (色彩之暈染法) indicates a tendency towards this school [of Zhang Sengyou]. Thus, the murals of the Hōryū-ji Golden Hall were created by adding Southern [Chinese/Indian] techniques to the Gandhara-influenced Koguryŏ art, testifying to the progress of art in that era and emitting a brilliant, unique radiance in world art history.

Besides these murals, there exists an Eleven-Faced Kannon (十一面觀音像) painted in vivid colors on dark blue silk (絹本紺地), attributed to Tamjing's hand, but there is no basis for this in historical records. Although its execution is said to be excellent, it was originally housed in a certain temple in Yamato (大和某寺), then circulated among private hands, and now even its whereabouts are uncertain, so we can only await future research.

Kasiil (加西溢)

He is the creator of the Tenjukoku Mandara Shūchō (天壽國曼荼羅繡帳 - Embroidered Tapestry of the Land of Heavenly Longevity), a national treasure hidden away at Chūgū-ji (中宮寺) in Nara, which, along with the Golden Hall murals, represents ancient Japanese painting. Compared to the murals, its simple and archaic style is-e

第三 高句麗時代의美術家
美術이라는것은職業은아니라 金錢으로써報酬를 求하는職業은아니라. 美術家는長生과名望을爲하야創作을出함이아니오 自我의神秘的要求에順應할이라. 더구나人口가稀薄한 古代에 在하야는 生活의 困乏과 如함은 美術家의念外에 置하얏든것 일지라. 故로一般社會가美術家의忘却을介意함이無하얏나니彼等은一個人의創造라함보다도一社會, 一團體의力作이라함을尙하얏도다. 이미一般의理想이如斯한지라 어 可히 美術家의 前後함을 期望할 바-리오.
高句麗時代의美術的遺跡과遺物이罕貴함은勿論이라. 그保存法의不完全함을免치못하얏슴은一面그遺品을等閒視하얏슴을 證할아니라 오즉此를 平凡한古代物이라는觀念으로써對하얏슴을示하는者-라. 審美的價値의如何를 附하야그의 貴함으로써萬代에 傳崇하야後生을爲코자함도想及치못한바는아니엇슬지나 오히려貧弱한者이엇도다. 이미遺物과遺蹟으로서 如斯한지라 한 美術家의 傳치 못함을 答할바-아니로다.
儒佛仙三敎의竝行을圖한高句麗의政策이엇스나民心의歸依한者는오즉佛敎라. 이에他二敎보다美術과의 關係가 最切한 佛敎가 隆盛하니 是以로佛敎的美術이大興하도다. 大槪僧侶는動儉力行하야質素로爲守할새그의日常生活이閒臥의寸暇도不有하나니 美術的製作의 勞도 不辭함으로 그에 長함이 한 特色이라. 即古代佛敎＜16＞가興隆하든時代에는僧侶가美術家를 兼하얏슴이로다. 勿論佛敎에關한敎理와歷史를 若干斟酌치못하고는美術家라도佛敎的美術品을作키難하려니와鑑賞도그에對하야는眞趣를 得키難할지로다.
然則僧侶의美術家로傳함이有한가. 美術家는姑捨하고僧侶나마傳함이在한가. 可히十餘로數할지라. 然이나吾人의歷史는爭亂의記錄을爲事하야戰策으로僧侶의間牒을利用하얏슴을傳하거나中國沙門의來化를 述하얏슬이오 近邦의佛敎를 隆興하야燐然한文化를 建設한者와 한 그事實等에對하야는實로記한바를 未見이라하야도그過言이아닐진뎌. 如何히慘烈한攻戰이月로繼하며國家의興亡이歲로替하야中世에그記錄이問或紛失汚損의難을當하얏다할지라도自邦의過去事實을中國이나日本에憑據한다함은그眞을得키에躊躇하는者-나吾人은그로부터推考하야一層超然한者이엇슴을聯測하기極難한바도아님즉하기로 이에그史傳으로부터曇徵을論擧하야傳함이無한高句麗時代의美術家에想及코저하노라
曇徵
扶桑의佛敎가百濟로부터始傳하얏섯스나高句麗의沙門도優越한地位를 占하얏섯나니釋惠慈는高向麗嬰陽王五年夏五月, 扶桑에渡하매太子豊聰(聖德)이이에師하니佛法을弘演하야三賣의棟樑이되엇스며釋慧灌은高句麗榮留王七年春正月에渡去하야河內에井上寺를 創하고三論을始講하니이에扶桑三論宗의祖가되도다. 此外에도通道達敎의僧侶가不尠할새吾人이玆에論코저하는曇徵이 그의一人이라. 本朝高僧傳에云
釋曇徵, 推古十八年春三月, 高麗國貢來, 涉外學, 普五經, 又有伎藝, 造碾磑工彩畵, 是時本朝未善繪事, 就徵受指敎
該博한智慧와深奧한識見은外學과五經을能通하고더구나非凡한技能을兼備하야日本에無하든彩畵의妙法을傳함이로다. 日本書紀에曰
推古十八年二月, 高麗王貢上僧曇徵法定. 曇徵, 知五經, 且能作彩色及紙墨, 幷造碾磑, 蓋造碾磑始于是時軟＜17＞
是從來의所謂書畵를 尙치아니함은아니나水墨畵로서나文人의餘技로取할바요. 丹靑의五彩를 加함은即時賤劣하다하야特殊한名稱을附하고排斥하다십히한傳襲的儒道의末弊를 盲從하야온吾人의慣習으로 彩色을作하며紙墨을製함에能하얏다하면間或그외人格을此疑로써者하는-不無할지로다. 果然文化, 더구나技藝等事에는史筆을不擧하니豊裕한學識의主人인曇徵으로써吾人의史書에傳함이無함에據하야推想할지라도그以上優秀한畵家가國內에無數多存함이엇는지는不知로되그一般工藝에對한記錄의絶無를 斟酌할지로다.
高句麗의美術家曇徵은釋曇徵으로 工人의 曇徵이엇스며 畵家의 曇徵이엇스며 彫刻師의 曇徵이엇나니 此가 高句麗時代의 通例라. 即我邦의 古代에 在하야서도 畵家와 彫刻家와는 同一人이 兼備하얏슴이 한 一特色이라. 曇徵에關한史傳은此外에別異한者-無하기로更히蛇足을不加하고玆에그의作品에依하야考究코저하노라.
扶桑法隆寺金堂壁畵는 東西에 稀類한 壁畵로 金堂의 高重한 價値를 做出하는大作이어니와古來로그를 論하는者-何某의作임을斷치 못하얏나니 或은 古今目錄抄나 七大寺日記等의 誤傳을 信하야 畵師鳥의筆이라 稱하도다. 然이나此는堂內釋迦三尊像이鳥佛師의彫刻品임을그光焔背銘에依하야考覈치못한故라하노니佛像의兩貌가長眉細眼하며鼻筋이直隆하야雄邁의趣를 現한等問或相類의點을具치아니하는바도아니니 壁畵의巧妙優麗한圖法은線條가流暢하고도溫健하며色彩가幽玄하고도微妙함이야豈可以釋迦三尊像의作者인鳥佛師의筆이라할者-리오. 古代彫刻家로서는비록擅名하는바-  鳥佛師나畵師로는稱함에지不至할지로다. 世人의疑하는바-作者의不詳이 한當然라할지니이에吾人은此가曇徵의遺墨임을論證코저하노라.
(一) 曇徵渡去以前의扶桑畵界 日本雄略帝時代(西紀四七○年頃)에百濟로부터畵工의渡日이始行하야畵部의稱이初有하얏나니그後佛敎의傳함을隨하야白如, 阿佐等의畵師가相踵渡去하얏슴으로幼稚하기兒戱와類하야可히論할바-못되는扶桑의畵界는그들의特殊한保護와獎勵에依하야此에一新面을開함에至하얏도다. 然이나當時의繪畵는尙且墨畵의域을脫치못하얏든者-라. 後期에서보는바燐然한賦彩와如함은行치못하얏슴이로다. 故로繪畵로는未開하얏든暗黙時代임을不免하얏든者이엇도다.
(二) 曇徵의功蹟 蓋世의氣를 奠한高句麗의人曇徵이一次東海를 越하야扶桑의島國에至하매僧侶로佛法＜18＞의弘布는勿論이요. 彩色과紙墨의製法을傳하니繪事에善치못하든當時의畵界라. 비롯오彩色畵를 曇徵에게就하야學하얏섯도다. 由是觀之컨대當代人士의優待를 可想이며더욱壁畵의筆者임을聯測함에裕足할지로다. 實로此曇徵의法定과法隆寺에同居하얏슴이史書에明明함이리오. 平氏太子傳에云
推古天皇十八年庚午三月, 高麗僧曇徵, 法定, 二口來, (中略) 太子命曰, 法師等遲來, 宜住吾寺, 即置法隆寺. 云云
創建完成後僅僅數年을不經한法隆寺에寺主聖德太子의請을諾하야留居한曇徵이라. 壁畵를 筆하얏슴이한至當한事라할지로다.
現存한法隆寺金堂壁畵에就하야그構形과技巧의大略을愚見으로나마一言하야 우리의大藝術家曇徵의偉大한天才的人格에想及코저 하노라 壁畵는 四個의 大壁에 畵한 四佛淨士圖와 堂內四隅에 二個式總八個의 小壁에 畵한 菩薩圖로서 成하니 東壁의 寶生淨刹圖는 他의三壁에 比하면 布置法이 甚히 貧弱하고 線條가한萎縮함은同時의作이아님을可知할지니即中世의遇難時破壞되어그後改作한者임으로써라. 故로曇徵의筆로는他三壁이尙存하는者-니그間彩色을補加하얏슴도不無할지나北壁西側의釋迦國士圖는剝落이最甚하야畵面이稀薄할새今日에그中完存한者로는西壁의阿彌陀淨士圖와北壁東側의藥師刹士圖의二者라할지로다. 西壁中尊은蓮花上에坐할새兩手를 擧하야說法의形을作하고脇士인觀音과勞至의兩菩薩의立像을畵하얏스며藥師淨士圖의中尊은獅子座에踞하야右手를 擧하고左手를 膝上에置하니左右에四菩薩과二比丘와四天等이從하도다. 그面貌와姿態가高雅幽寂하며雄偉端麗하니中尊은全身에衣를 被하야印度式의右裸를 未見이요無數한寫實風의裕紋은그와伴하야西域의「간다라」式을表하니더욱藥師의像과如함은右手의上擧로因하야右側의胷邊이稍披되고左手를 托한左膝이한裳襞의分埀로因하야襯衣를 現한等은三十二相式의傳襲的「만나리즘」의舊弊에서脫한者-라할지요. 西壁의彌陀의自然스럽은襯衣은暈染法의濃淡이自在하며說法形의溫柔한兩手는細密한寫實的描寫를 越하야全身에充溢하는바靈韻이生動하니此는上下左右의均齊美와形體美로부터出來하얏슴이아니라實로宗敎的內在美를 具하며更히그拘束을超脫함으로부터做成된者-니果然畵者曇徵의敬虔한信仰과憧＜19＞憬의流露며그의全自我의表現이라. 오즉獨創的究地에達하얏슴이로다.
此壁畵는全壁面에白土를 塗하고線條로써그形을寫하며墨朱黃靑紅綠으로써彩色을加한者-니靑綠의寒色이朱黃의暖色을抱圍하야閒寂의想을起케하도다. 翠玉金飾의寶冠을戴한脇士의諸菩薩은五彩가玲瓏한胷飾과腕環을繞하며上半身은거의裸體로大槪가袈裟를 左肩으로부터右腋下에着하니兩方으로부터埀下하야半月形을作하얏도다. 半捻한腰部에는纖薄한羅衣를 䌵하니兩脚이한歷然히透顯할새兩手의擧止와上下身의調和가「리즈미칼」의流露한裸體美로부터進하야現實의解放을意味함에至하얏고五獨의汚染을超越한淨土界의悅樂이想見되도다. 淸淑한黙想과仁慈한偉風의表現等實로曇徵의直實한靈的生活이做出한者-라. 그의人格을可想이오 更히高句麗人의造形美術上本質的憧憬과한理想을斟酌함에足할지로다.
壁畵의筆法은今日에尙傳하는바와特異함이別無하나 當時의繪畵로서他에類例를 不見하는陰影法의應用이始行되엇슴이라. 한 此壁畵의一特長이될지니 中尊의 𧛸紋에서가장顯著하며蓮花座에도一一이濃淡을加하야凹凸의形을作하고菩薩等에至하야는朱線으로써其形을 寫하고朱로써 陰影을 出하야諺面과筋骨의隆伏을示하도다.
此陰影의法이江西三墓의四神圖를 想케하니線條의輪廓으로부터中央을向하야漸次色調가稀薄하야짐이라今日의明暗描寫와는稍異할지나오히려特殊한技巧家의葡萄를 寫함에도比할者- 로다. 然則堂內厨子의密陀繪로부터天井의鳳凰等으로부터高句麗古墳內의壁畵와相符하얏슴과似하야그相類點을發見하며聚合함은此亦그系統을溯究함에便한者-라.
曇徵은高句麗嬰陽王時代의人이라. 吾人의探考함을得한바-古墳이處處에旣成된以後라. 發達한그畵法의傳統을受하얏고更히南卞筆法의感化를 蒙한듯하도다.
百濟聖王이使를 梁에遺하야工匠과畵師를 請求한지라六十餘年後의事인즉當時梁의畵風과도不少한關係를 有할지라. 梁의張僧繇의遺墨이라傳하든健康一乘寺의扁額은그花形이西域의法을留한다하야此를 遙望하면畵面에凹凸이有함과似함으로一名凹凸寺라稱하얏다하니한暈染法의旣行을可知며그의創始한바-沒骨皺＜20＞은從來의線條보다도暈染法으로畵한故라.
金堂壁畵에在하야도色彩의暈染法으로因하야特殊한線條美을尙치아니함은斯流의傾向이有함이라할지로다이에「간다라」系統의高句麗化한美術에印度에南方的技巧를 添하야當代藝術의進步를 證하며世界美術史上煥然한異彩를 發하는法隆寺金堂의壁畵는成來하얏도다.
此壁畵外에도曇徵의筆跡이라고傳하는絹本紺地에極彩色으로畵한十一面觀音像이存하나史記의憑據할바無하며그作成이비록優秀타하나大和某寺의所藏이엇든것이轉轉하야民間에流落함으로今에그所在지도未確하니後考를 期할따름이라.
加西溢
金堂壁畵와더불어日本古代의繪畵를 代表하는奈良中宮寺秘藏의天壽國曼荼羅繡帳의作者라. 壁畵와比하야簡朴古拙한風致는勿論同日의論이아닐者-며東漢末賢과漢奴加己利等과의合作이나多至波奈大女郞의歎願을聽하야造成된者인즉 當時의粹를 拔한 者이 엇슬지라. 加西溢의才能과爲人을推測함에足할지로다.
以上은高句麗時代의美術家로史書에僅傳하는바-어니와末代寶藏王時에도그의美術家는扶桑藝術界에頭角을 顯하얏섯나니 高麗畵師麻呂의 名은 後代日本齊明帝時에도 錚錚하얏섯도다.
遺物의流失됨이어東明聖王의建國以後七百餘年의星霜이輪替한지라. 日本과의關係를 有한高句麗의美術家가어此에止하고巳할者-리오. 아니諸他近邦과의緣由를 持한美術家는如何하얏스랴. 遺物도不存한其等은尙且姑捨하고半島國內의古墳을築造하며壁畵를 描寫한諸大美術家는果然如何한者이엇는지, 憶想함에도 漠然함을 奈何오.
古記의闕함이어審美的渴望에苦惱하는吾人으로 하야곰 歲輪의悠遠을憑하야黙然코天才的偉大한高句麗의美術家를 埋하고可할것이랴. ……(未完)＜21＞
