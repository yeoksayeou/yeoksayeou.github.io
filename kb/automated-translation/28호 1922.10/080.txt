◎謝告◎ (Apology Notice)

The two pieces, 「都市巡禮의 其二」 (Urban Pilgrimage, Part Two) and 「社會日誌」 (Social Diary), scheduled for publication in the current October issue, are postponed until next month's issue due to editorial circumstances. <70>

**Summary**

This brief notice from the editors of *Gaebyeok* magazine informs readers that two planned articles, "Urban Pilgrimage, Part Two" and "Social Diary," will be delayed from the October 1922 issue to the November issue because of unspecified "editorial circumstances." For historians, this notice offers a glimpse into the practical challenges of publishing a magazine in colonial Korea. While "editorial circumstances" is vague, it could potentially hint at various issues, from simple logistical problems or content delays to more sensitive matters like censorship pressures exerted by the Japanese Government-General, although the notice itself doesn't explicitly state this.
