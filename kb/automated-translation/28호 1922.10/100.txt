Miscellaneous Observations from Honam and Hoseo / Inside Sindoan, the Royal Den of Superstition
Ch'unp'a

K Hyŏng (Brother K). During that time, I traveled through Kwangju, Mokp'o, Kunsan, the three capitals of Honam, and then visited Hoseo, stopping by a farming village in Nonsan, the Great Stone Buddha in Ŭnjin, and Tonghaksa, Kapsa, and Sinwŏnsa temples at Kyeryongsan Mountain. Now I have arrived at the site of the future capital, that is, the royal den of superstition called Sindoan. In the meantime, what I saw, heard, and felt from south and north, east and west, mountains and fields, sea and river, city and village, person to person, was truly not insignificant. Circumstances make it difficult to relate everything one by one, but I will now select the main points and introduce them to you, Hyŏng.

K Hyŏng. Didn't you once say, "Sitting on the Honam line feels like going far, far away to a different country south of the river (江南別國)"? Indeed, it was so. The train relentlessly sped southward, like pouring water into a bottle; truly, the feeling of heading to Kangnam was not absent.

K Hyŏng. From Kanggyŏng, Iri, Kimje, Chŏngŭp down to Kwangju and Mokp'o, this year's harvest (年事) was truly a great bumper crop for the ages. According to local people, it's the best harvest they've seen in recent years, and this year there was no flood damage and no insect damage. They say the yield will increase by at least 30% compared to average years. However, they added that the future feels insecure.
In the train, rather than sleeping, rather than reading a book, rather than looking at the mountains and rivers along the way, I was so engrossed in observing the abundant grain in the fields, jiggling up and down, that even now, on the edge of some village house's wooden floor, I still feel the bouncing sensation.

K Hyŏng. Kwangju, whether seen for its mountains and rivers, its fertile soil, the bright and kind nature of its people, its rectangular, well-ordered streets, its considerable educational facilities, or the cultural movements of its youth, everything looked quite decent. However, the one dreadful thing was that—that petty and vicious 'mohi' (모히) god still hides in the skin and hearts<87> of young men and women, sucking their blood drop by drop and slicing away their flesh bit by bit.
This 'mohi' hungry ghost (餓鬼) invaded Kwangju five or six years ago, and for a while, it flourished so much that Kwangju nearly fell into the tragic state of ruin. Fortunately, thanks to the united prevention efforts and desperate repulsion by concerned youth, especially the local youth association, more than seventy percent of its influence has been suppressed. Yet, remnants of these bandits still hide in some parts, and it's said there are still over a hundred addicts. However, as the iron fists of the youth relentlessly strike from all directions, it is said its traces will be completely eradicated within a few months.
Local people too grind their teeth in indignation, but what makes even a passing traveler like me feel righteous anger is the local officials. Despite the 'mohi' invasion being like this and the youth association's prevention efforts being like that, the officials merely look on nonchalantly. Setting aside the lack of severe punishment for addicts, the way they handle clandestine sellers half-heartedly clearly shows an attitude of silently watching the destruction of the Korean people. Thus, the voices of local youth criticizing the authorities are passed mouth to mouth, making the entire city of Kwangju buzz. While the fault lies with the addicts themselves, the psychology of the Japanese is truly detestable and cruel. The clandestine sellers are entirely Japanese, and the addicts are entirely Korean, they say. This is presented as a major turning point issue for the rise or fall of the people of Kwangju, and broadly, a pending issue requiring the self-awareness and countermeasures of our Korean brethren.

K Hyŏng. This is an ugly incident I saw in Songjŏngni. It was right on the roadside east of the Songjŏng Station plaza. About five or six women selling food were sitting in a row by the road, selling their wares, but it was so hideous and dirty that just thinking about it makes me feel nauseous even now.
Who knows when they last washed their faces; their faces were blotchy, their hair was carelessly tied up, they wore torn hemp blouses (布赤衫) and aprons, and had worn-out dining tables placed before them. On the tables were bowls of young radish kimchi, chili paste stew, soy sauce, and salt. Beneath the tables, large wicker baskets held heaps of Japanese noodles or perhaps Chinese noodles. Holding long tobacco pipes horizontally in their mouths, they chatted idly, observed the movements of passersby, and called out "Noodles!" "Rice cakes!"—it was truly unbearable to watch. Perhaps they had drunk makgeolli (막걸리) or perhaps it was their usual habit, but they stretched and retracted their necks, tapped rhythms on their knees, and sang miscellaneous songs like "Oh, my fate!" and "Do we live a thousand years, or ten thousand years?" without any inhibition. It was truly too embarrassing to watch in front of foreigners. Dust and chaff occasionally flew<88> and covered the food tables, and flies and dayflies swarmed as if to devour people, yet laborers and travelers huddled around, willing to eat—ah, it was suffocating to watch. Had they put up even a tent or had some support, the sight wouldn't have been so savage. Had they refrained from singing miscellaneous songs and tidied their appearance a bit, it wouldn't have been so disgusting, but whether it's their custom or their nature, they persist in advertising their vulgarity. What can be done? Chinese people stood staring blankly, while Japanese people giggled and pointed fingers. Yet, they remained oblivious, as before. Is it because they are originally commoners, or because they are poor?
K Hyŏng. Is this only about them? It can be seen throughout the three kingdoms (三國 - i.e., all Korea) and also in the northwest. If you go to P'yŏngyang, don't there seem to be even more men and women selling food by the roadside?
K Hyŏng. How can such bad customs be eradicated? One might say it's our level of knowledge, our standard of living, but isn't there a possibility for improvement or guidance in such matters? It seems it could be easily achieved through the activities of committed youth in each location. We absolutely cannot just stand by and watch. For the sake of the dignity of that region, that people, we absolutely cannot feign ignorance. We cannot wait for their self-awakening, nor can we hope for the goodwill of the authorities. The authorities are quick to talk about sanitation and cleanliness, yet they pay no attention to things like this. The reality is they secretly delight in it, thinking, "Go ahead, you fools, advertise your barbaric customs as much as you want! It causes us not one bit of harm."
K Hyŏng. No matter what, it seems most meaningful for us to speak up, awaken, and correct these minor affairs of the local common folk whenever we see or encounter them, so I have included this incident.

K Hyŏng. At Mokp'o, the moonlit night at Mokp'o Terrace (木浦臺), scenically, truly made one feel like singing loudly and leaping for joy, but as sorrow was still abundant, I almost burst into loud weeping. The rocks of Yudalsan Mountain seemed to issue a great reprimand, and the pine forest of Kohado Island (where Admiral Yi Ch'ungmu's (李忠武) inscription exists) seemed tinged with grief. Seeing the orderly and prosperous Japanese residential area and then, in a corner of Pukkyo-dong, the shabby market district of our compatriots, I got so angry that I just clenched my fists a couple of times and let it be.
Coming to Kunsan, it was also the same as Mokp'o. I merely spent one night alone in Kunsan Park, feeling and grieving. It is an unspeakable sorrow that in any open port city, the record concerning Koreans diminishes significantly.

K Hyŏng. This is about a great joyful event, a highly exciting festivity called Nongsa Kye (農事契, Farming Guild, also known as P'ungmul 風物), that is,<89>
*turemŏgi* (두레먹이), which I saw in Namsan-ni, Ŭnjin-myŏn, Nonsan-gun, a corner of the Kanggyŏng plain. In regions like P'yŏngan-do or Hamgyŏng-do, such customs do not exist in farming villages. However, in the Kyŏnggi region and the three southern provinces (三南), this custom, namely *turemŏgi*, is widely practiced.
During the spring rice planting season or the summer weeding season, if you go to the Kyŏnggi or Samnam regions, you can hear and see flags fluttering and the clamorous sounds of small gongs (막이소리) and small drums (小鼓소리) in villages or on farms. Those seeing it for the first time might wonder what kind of festivity it is, perhaps some kind of immortal's play, feeling very curious and finding it marvelous. Thus, some stop walking and watch intently for a while, and others follow closely, even doing shoulder dances (억개춤). However, it is not easy to know what kind of festivity this is. I too had seen this two or three times and just knew it was a Nongsa Kye festivity, without knowing the details. Fortunately, coming here, I learned the inside story of *turemŏgi* and found it truly a beautiful custom of the farming village and something worth boasting about widely.
The very day I went to Namsan-ni was the *turemŏgi* day for Namsan-ni. My friend, Mr. K, is said to be the head (頭目) of this village's farming guild (農契). So, all the farmers gathered in the head's yard, planted a large flag inscribed "Legacy of Sinnong (神農遺業)," blew trumpets, beat small drums and drums, sounded gongs and *jeung* (증), and played boisterously—truly a spectacle. Some wore flower wreaths on their hats (패랭이) and did hip-shaking dances (응덩춤); flower children (花童) dressed as butterflies or disguised as maidens danced the shoulder dance (억개춤) exceptionally well; skilled children (技童) wearing pointed hats (고깔) performed piggyback dances (무동춤); some did puppet dances (장춤), others shrimp dances (새우춤)—their eye movements, mouth movements, hand movements perfectly matched the rhythm, a grand spectacle surpassing the theater. After playing for a while, they would gulp down a large bowl (一大白) of liquor each and then play again, continuing boisterously day and night until the whole village seemed to shake. Although the origin—when and how this *turemŏgi* began—is unknown, it is a kind of military-style farming guild. Before spring rice planting, all farmers hold a village meeting (洞會) and elect a head (頭目) and one official (公員) for the year. For farming matters and village affairs that year, they receive commands from this head. This *ture* (두레) involves all farmers working together on one household's tasks for a day in sequence. The wages are paid into the farming guild's public fund (公金), used for village public affairs, purchasing and repairing musical instruments, and other public expenses, including funding events like this *turemŏgi* day.
On the day the *ture* is formed (두레난다는 날), meaning the day they work on a certain household's task, the head issues an order to all farmers, saying, "Today we will work on so-and-so's field, everyone come out." (No one can refuse to come out<90>). And the household whose work is being done cannot refuse, even if they privately wish to do it themselves (because everyone's turn will come eventually). When the *ture* workers (두레ㅅ軍) head to the farm, they are led by the command flag (令旗) and the dragon flag (龍旗 - inscribed 神農遺業), followed by a pair of trumpets (喇叭), a pair of small drums (小鼓), a pair of small gongs (막이), one *jeung* (중), one hourglass drum (長鼓), and one large drum (大鼓) in succession. Under the command of the lead gong player (상쇠잡이), they march forward in military style. Upon reaching the farm, they plant the flag and begin weeding all at once. Two or three people playing the drum and gong follow behind the weeding group (김군), urging them to weed faster or slower, scolding those who fall behind, and slowing the rhythm for those ahead. Then everyone gets excited and weeds so well that a field of one or two *majigi* (마지기 - unit of land) is finished in the blink of an eye. After weeding like that for a while, they drink a large bowl (一大白) of liquor, smoke a pipe of tobacco each, then get up and excitedly dance and jump around for a while before weeding again, and again. They say they work all day without feeling tired, full of energy, singing farmers' songs.

K Hyŏng. Isn't it truly a fine custom? And
the '*turemŏgi* day' occurs twice a year, spring and autumn. On this day, the head, based on the money earned that year and what remains after public expenses, buys several *sŏk* (석 - unit of volume) of rice and several *kwan* (관 - unit of weight) of meat and distributes them to each household. The meaning is that after working hard all year, earning money well, and having a good harvest, they should eat well and play well for one day. Why does the head buy and distribute? They say it's because if they gave money for each household to eat and play as they please, there might be inequality, with some eating well and others not. So, they do it based on the principle of uniform equality. Also, on this *turemŏgi* day, every household bathes, wears new clothes, cleans inside and outside the house, cleans the well, sweeps the roads, performing a major cleanup. Afterward, they select the most peaceful and trouble-free house in the village, perform a grand ritual to the earth god (土地神), and then each household eats well, runs around, and plays well. They say this biannual spring and autumn great cleanup (春秋二大淸潔) is unsurpassed. After that, the men gather at the head's house or perhaps a large house and play extravagantly all day and through the night for two or three days. The liquor for this day is provided obligatorily by each household according to the amount of farming they do: a 30-*tu* (斗) household provides 30 bowls (器), a 20-*tu* household 20 bowls, a 5-*tu* household 5 bowls—every house contributes. In this way, the entire village enjoys communal celebration twice a year. Truly a beautiful custom.

K Hyŏng. I want to promote this everywhere in Korea. Seen from various aspects, it seems like a beautiful custom. It seems beneficial for friendship, comfort, and collective strength. However, they say that because of this, the power struggles between villages <91> are not insignificant. When farming flags (農旗) meet, they refuse to yield the path to each other, argue about who should bow first, leading to major fights, and sometimes even murder. It used to be very severe in the past, but it's said to have become somewhat milder now.

K Hyŏng. After seeing such a pleasant event and beautiful custom in this farming village, the next day I saw the Ŭnjin Maitreya Buddha (彌勒佛) and visited the Nonsan market. Then, starting from Tugye Station, I spent the night in a thatched hut in the mountains called Ujŏkkol at Kyeryongsan. The day after, I crossed Kuryŏng Pass (鳩嶺) and saw Tonghaksa, Kapsa, and Sinwŏnsa temples. And the day after that, meaning this morning, I arrived here at Sindoan.

K Hyŏng. The Great Stone Buddha at Kwanch'oksa Temple in Ŭnjin is an Eastern, no, a world-famous object, whose fame has reached even village wives and peasant boys, so I will omit details here. The Nonsan market could best be called a food market (referring to roadside eateries). By the way, at the place called Ujŏkkol, I almost died. I happened to meet Brother Pangch'on (尨村兄) from Nonsan and we traveled together, but being new to the mountains, we didn't know the path, and dusk fell. Despite the darkness and treacherous path, as we were about to cross towards Tonghaksa, we fortunately met a kind old farmer from a mountain house. Thanks to his kind insistence on stopping us, we spent the night in the inner room (안방) of his mountain house. The next day, after crossing Kujŏkchae (구턱재 - Kuryŏng Pass), I realized that if it hadn't been for that old man yesterday evening, I would have already been crushed to powder and fallen into that stream below. It was truly perilous.
I'll also skip the stories of Tonghaksa and Kapsa (knowing that someone's travelogue of Kyeryongsan was included in the September issue at the time of editing). Now, I'll talk a bit about this
Royal Den of Superstition - Sindoan, and then conclude.

K Hyŏng. When one thinks of Kyeryongsan, one associates it with a capital city, with Mr. Chŏng (鄭哥), with Mr. Cho (趙哥), and also with Sich'ŏn'gyo (侍天敎)—this seems common for us. Since I was young (줌억위부터), I heard endlessly about Kyeryongsan becoming the capital. Recently, that talk has become even more rampant, with sayings like "Not long now (不在三年)" or "The Kapcha (甲子) year is the time," spreading frequently through rumors. Furthermore, strange tales abound: tens of thousands of Sich'ŏn'gyo followers have moved there, Kim Ku-am (金龜菴) has built a magnificent new palace, Ch'a Ch'ŏnja (車天子) has laid the foundation—all sorts of bizarre rumors circulate. Wondering if it's fact or rumor, knowing it's likely the delusions of superstitious people, I felt I had no choice but to go and see for myself. Despite my busy schedule, I spent two days visiting the so-called capital site, Sindoan.<92>

K Hyŏng. Don't be surprised. Setting aside whether it will be a capital or not, what I heard is true. Four to five thousand Sich'ŏn'gyo followers have gathered, and the number of newly built houses alone exceeds a thousand. There is a magnificent new building, perhaps a palace or hall, called the Kim Ku-am lodging house. There are also Sich'ŏn'gyo mission rooms and even a school. A new town composed of three sections looks better than a decent county seat (邑內). There's a West Gate Street (西門巨里) and an East Gate Street (東門巨里), a Chongno (鍾路), a palace site (宮터), Chejabong Peak (帝子峰), and also foundation stones (柱石), perhaps relics of Yi T'aejo (李太祖). It certainly evokes the feeling of a ruined capital (廢都) or perhaps a new capital (新都).
Looking at the topography, a ridge from Taedunsan Mountain (also called Hanjŏmsan) in Changsu, Chŏlla Province, stretches north, crossing Nonsan to become the so-called Sŏmunjae (West Gate Pass), the western ridge of Kyeryongsan. It then rises sharply to become the main peak of Kyeryongsan. From the main peak, a ridge curves eastward like a bow (弓形) straight towards Tugye. Another ridge leaps southward (충충 - sound of leaping/bounding?) to become Chejabong Peak, the main peak for the so-called new palace. To the superstitious or those versed in feng shui (風水), it might look plausible. They chatter excitedly about 'Left Blue Dragon, Right White Tiger' (左靑龍 右白虎), 'Twin Dragons Playing with a Pearl' shape (雙龍弄珠形), 'Golden Rooster Incubating an Egg' shape (金鷄抱卵形), 'Mountain Taiji, Water Taiji' (山太極水太極 - the water being the Kŭmgang River, also originating from Changsu; the name Kyeryongsan is said to derive from this meaning). Looked at another way, it does give the impression of a person spreading both arms to embrace something. In any case, the mountain terrain is perfectly shaped to generate talk of a new capital. Perhaps because of this, when I told someone I came to see Kyeryongsan, they patted the future prime minister or minister on the shoulder, full of hope, saying, "If you haven't studied geography, you won't easily know where is where, right? If you don't know how to read the mountain terrain, it's a wasted trip. It's truly well-formed," like a feng shui master drawn to a rich family's ancestral tomb. So, to further stimulate their psychology, I played along, saying, "I'm not that ignorant of geography either, it truly is well-formed," and then trailed off with, "When will it become the capital...?" They replied, "It will happen gradually. How could the great destiny of ages come so easily?" showing simple-minded joy.
However, asking even a common eye, no, even a child, it wouldn't even make a decent village layout (村排布), let alone a capital. The basin itself is barely the size of a dustpan (삼태기), and the supposed palace site and Chongno area are slightly elevated, but the streams flowing from the eastern and western valleys of Kyeryongsan form dry riverbeds (乾川) filled with rocks and sand, making farming impossible. Being a mountain valley, transportation is inconvenient, making trade impossible—a land utterly unsuitable for farming or commerce. When I mentioned this to someone, they showed displeasure and retorted, "When it becomes the capital, they'll fix it up nicely. Where is there a place that's perfect from the start? In this age of moving mountains and waters (移山移水)—" and turned away abruptly. It seems plausible. Looking at things like this, it seems<93> that everyone gathered here is completely caught in the net of superstition.
Stopping by a thatched house, I requested an introduction to a Sich'ŏn'gyo follower weaving straw mats. When I asked, "Why have you gathered in this barren land unsuitable for farming or commerce to endure hardship?" he looked at me suspiciously for a long moment, as if wondering, "Is this person a spy?" then said, "Just—for no particular reason, everyone else was coming, so I came too," and stubbornly just twisted the straw rope. When asked where he came from, he said Hwanghae Province. When asked which region's people came here the most, he said mostly Hwanghae Province, followed by P'yŏngan Province. Asked if he farms, he said he couldn't. Asked how he makes a living, he just said he weaves straw mats and since he just arrived, everything is like this. I pressed further, "Still, there must be a reason. What motivated you to come?"—what was the connection (연줄)? He only repeated, "I just came following connections (연줄연줄)." Truly, they are pitiful. Outside the door, a few sweet persimmons (沈단근감) were laid out, while inside the room, they wove straw mats, just looking at the faces of passersby, seeming to silently plead for a means of subsistence (糊口).

K Hyŏng. After making inquiries (計家하다?), I toured the streets extensively, saw the mission room, school, main temple (本願寺?), and the supposedly swaying foundation stone (趾石돍). I also viewed that lodging house. With large stone pillars one or two *chang* (丈 - unit of length) high and timber thicker than an arm span, it was built quite magnificently for the countryside. Even now, followers gather for corvée labor (賦役), but they don't know when it will be completed. The budget is said to be 20,000 Won, but even that is uncertain. The stone is quarried from Kyeryongsan, the timber transported from Suwon. Money comes from the Sich'ŏn'gyo headquarters, but mostly it's obligatory labor from the followers.
K Hyŏng. There must be an inside story, but I cannot write it for fear of being slanderous. Also, as these newly arrived compatriots cling only to hope for their survival, I cannot bear to reveal their secrets (though I may not know them anyway). I have only written the facts as I saw and heard them. But,

K Hyŏng. Do you know why the Kyeryongsan capital theory arose? It's a known story, but since I started talking about it, I'll briefly recount it.
When Yi T'aejo was planning the great affair with Chŏng To-jŏn, we can infer that his grand strategies and clever tactics were multi-faceted. They had already chosen Hanyang as the new capital site but worried that it was close to the old capital, Songdo, and that the people's hearts had not yet submitted to him. So, they secretly buried a millstone inscribed with the three characters "Wangsimni" (往十里 - Go Ten Li) about ten *li* east of Hanyang. As a preliminary plan to win popular support, they first came to the eastern side of Kyeryongsan and pretended to build a palace fortress, working hard for three days. During<94> these three days, a fake old woman (假老婆?), a mountain grandmother (山한머니?), an old woman selling rice cakes, came continuously and sold rice cakes to Yi T'aejo. On the third day, the old woman spoke to Yi T'aejo, saying, "This land belongs to Mr. Chŏng (鄭氏); your labor is in vain. Your land is Hanyang, so you must quickly go to Hanyang," and then suddenly disappeared. This was one of T'aejo's clever schemes, but the populace was completely deceived. From then on, T'aejo proclaimed, "The Kyeryongsan mountain spirit grandmother has directed me to Hanyang! She is a spirit; how could there be disagreement? My fortune will greatly prosper from now on!" While widely propagating this, he also built a shrine to the Kyeryongsan spirit, offered sacrifices, and conspired with Chŏng To-jŏn to create apocryphal texts like the *Chŏnggamnok* (鄭堪錄), making discontented people at the time give up hope until many centuries later—indeed, it's true that his schemes were numerous. Although this was clearly fabricated by Yi T'aejo, the people have been deceived. It has been passed down for five hundred years that the Chŏng clan will establish their capital at Kyeryongsan. It's also true that they carved strange words on the mountain, spread children's rhymes, and created strange books to win the hearts of the masses.

K Hyŏng. There is also the Cho clan (趙氏) capital theory. In the past, an adopted son of a certain Mr. Cho, wanting to repay his foster father's kindness, studied geography diligently, selected his grave site, and then proclaimed: "Rooted in Songdo (松都), leafing in Hanyang (漢陽), blooming in Kyeryong (鷄龍), fruiting in Kaya (伽倻)." This is also one of the Kyeryong capital theories. But,
There is another theory about why Sich'ŏn'gyo followers have recently gathered here in large numbers. It is said that the character 'Ku' (龜 - turtle) in the name of the religion's leader, Kim Ku-am (金龜菴), corresponds with a line from a poem revealed by the religion's Great Divine Teacher (大神師): "When spring returns to Turtle Peak (龜岳), the whole world blossoms (一世花)." Interpreting this as the intention of National Teacher Ku-am (龜菴國師), followers are flocking to Kyeryongsan, or so someone relates. There are too many bizarre interpretations (酬酌), so I cannot remember them all, nor are they worth introducing. One can only laugh and dismiss them.

K Hyŏng. I will see you in person in a few days. That's all.
………(Evening of September 8th)………<95>

**Summary**

The author, Ch'unp'a, recounts his travels through the Honam and Hoseo regions of Korea in 1922. He describes the bountiful harvest, contrasts the prosperity of Japanese areas with the struggles of Koreans in port cities like Mokp'o and Kunsan, laments the prevalence of morphine ('mohi') addiction among Koreans in Kwangju (blaming Japanese sellers and indifferent officials), and criticizes unsanitary practices among poor food vendors. He also details a vibrant communal farming custom called *turemŏgi* in a Nonsan village. The latter part focuses on his visit to Sindoan near Kyeryongsan, a place prophesied to be a future capital, now attracting thousands of Sich'ŏn'gyo followers living in poor conditions but clinging to millenarian hopes. Ch'unp'a expresses skepticism about the prophecy, tracing its origins to political maneuvering by Yi T'aejo and Chŏng To-jŏn, and observes the followers' desperate faith amidst hardship.

From a historical perspective, the article offers valuable insights into early colonial Korean society. It highlights the stark economic disparities between Japanese settlers and Koreans, the social problem of drug addiction explicitly linked to Japanese suppliers and official neglect, and the persistence of traditional communal practices (*turemŏgi*) alongside rural poverty. Most significantly, the detailed account of the Sindoan community provides a contemporary glimpse into the appeal of millenarian religious movements (like Sich'ŏn'gyo, related to Tonghak/Ch'ŏndogyo) fueled by prophecy (*Chŏnggamnok*) among displaced or hopeful Koreans seeking solace and a future escape from the difficulties of colonial rule. The blend of social commentary, cultural observation, and reporting on religious fervor makes it a rich source for understanding the complexities of Korean life in the 1920s.

兩湖雜觀/迷信의 王窟新都안에서
						春坡

K兄. 나는 그 間 光州, 木浦 羣山等 湖南三都를 두루보고 다시 湖西에 들러 論山의 어 農村과 恩津의 大石佛과 鷄龍山의 東鶴, 甲寺, 新元寺等을 보고 至今未來의 都邑地 即 迷信의 王窟-어 新都안이란곳을 왓나이다 그 間 南과 北 東과 西 山과 들 바다와 江 都市와 村 사람과 사람에 본 바 들은 바 感한 바가 實로적지안핫나이다. 形便에 依하야 一一이 말슴키는 어려우나 이제 그 대강을 들어 兄 紹介하려 하나이다.
K兄. 兄이 일즉 말슴하기를 『湖南線을 타고 안즈면 멀리멀리 江南別國으로 가는 것다』고 하셧지요? 果然이더이다 車가 줄곳 南으로만 甁에 물붓듯이 쏘다지는 것은 果然江南行의 感히업지안하엿나이다.
K兄. 江景 裡里 金堤 井邑으로 光州 木浦지의 今年年事는 果然萬古大豊이더이다.
當地人士의 말을 듯건대 近年처음보는 大豊인데 今年은 水害도 업고 蟲災도 업다합니다 例年에 比하야 無慮 三割以上은 增收하겟다 합니다 그러나 將來가 未安하다하더이다
나는 車中에서 잠자기보다도 冊읽기보다도 沿路의 山川보다도 萬田豊穀을 觀賞하기에 웅덩이를 어나 들먹거렷는지 지금 村家의 어 마루치나마 尙今것웅딍이바람이나나이다.

K兄. 光州는 山川으로보든지 土沃함으로 보든지 사람들이 人事性밝고  淳厚함으로보든지 長方形으로 正正하게된 市街로 보든지 敎育機關이 相當히 設備됨으로 보든지 靑年들의 文化運動으로 보든지 모든 것이 그럴 듯이 보이나 다만 한가지 怪惡한 것은 그-齷齪스럽고 至毒한『모히』神이 靑年男女의 皮膚와 心＜87＞藏에 그대로 숨어잇서 피를  아먹으며 고기를 싹싹 저며내는 그것이더이다
이-『모히』餓鬼가 光州에 侵犯하기는 벌서 五六年前이엇는데 한참은 아조 旺盛이되어 光州가 거의 亡할 悲境에 陷하얏는 것을 幸히 有志靑年, 特히 當地靑年會의 團結的豫防 必死的擊退下에서 거의 그 勢의 七分以上을 거눌럿는데 오히려 一部一部에 그-殘賊이 숨어잇서 尙今것 百名以上의 中毒者를 가지고 잇다 합니다 그러나 靑年들의 鐵拳이 四方에서 不絶히 불룩어티매 不幾數月에 그 迹이 頓滅하리라 합니다
그런데 當地人士도 忿槪하야 이를 갈다십히 하지만 듯기에 過客조차 義憤이 생기는 것은 當地의 官路者 그들입니다 『모히』의 侵犯이 이러하고 靑年會의 豫防이 이러하지만 官路者 그들은 尋常觀하고 만다는 그것이외다 中毒者에게 重罰이 업습은 姑捨하고 密賣者에게 어름어름하는 手段을 取하는 그것이 朝鮮人滅亡을 暗觀하는 態가 넉넉히 보인다하야 當地靑年들의 當局非難의 聲은 口口相傳에 光州市內가 들석하더이다 罪는 中毒者-自身에 잇지만 어든 日本人의 心理야말로 可憎可酷합니다 密賣者는 全혀 日本人이며 中毒者는 全혀 朝鮮人이라합니다 이것이 光州人士-興替의 一大分歧問題이며 널리 朝鮮兄弟-自覺 는 對策의 懸案이라하야 一段을 紹介하얏나이다

K兄. 이것은 松汀里에서 본 醜事입니다 바로 松汀驛前廣場東便路邊이외다 어 飮食장사 女便네 五六名이 路㥬에 列坐하야 飮食을 파는 모양인데 어나 醜하고 더러운지 생각만하면 지금것 口逆이 날듯합니다
어느 옛적에 洗面을 하얏는지 얼굴은 얼숭덜숭한데다가 머리를 함부로 틀어올리고 저진 벼(布)赤衫 행주치마를 두루고 어진 밥床을 압헤노코 床우에는 열무김치 고초탕친 것 간장 소곰 各한 그릇식을 노코 床미테는 크다란 별덕광주리에 倭국수인지 胡군수인지 한광주리담어노코 기다란 烟竹을 가루물고 이러니 저러니 雜談을 하면서 往來客의 動靜을 삷혀가며『국수요』『이요』하는 은 참아못보겟더이다 그리면서 막걸리잔이나먹어그런지 本來버릇이그런지 목을 늘엿다 줄엿다하며 무릅장단을 치며『아이고내 八字야』『千年을 살거나 萬年이나사드란 말이냐』等 雜歌를 忌憚업시 불르는 이야 참아 外國人부러워 못보겟더이다 몬지와 검불은 로날려＜88＞ 飮食床을 뒤덥고 파리와 하루살이들은 사람을 잡아먹을 듯이 뒤덤비는데 그래도 먹겟다고 웅숭그리고 빙둘러안즌 勞働者 는 行客들-아-氣막혀 못 보겟더이다 天幕이라도치고 依支라도 하얏스면 이 그러케 사납지는 안흘터이고 雜歌라도 아니하고 外貌라도 좀 다스렷스면 비위가 그러케는 傷하지는 안켓지만 風俗이 그런지 性質이 그런지 終是野卑함을 그대로 廣告함에 어하겟습니 中國人은 물럼이 서서 보고 日本人은  웃으며 손가락질하더이다 그래도 그들은 如前히 모릅니다 原來 常人이라 그런지 貧民이라 그런지?
K兄. 이것이 어 이들입니 三國到處에서 볼 수 잇스며 西北에서도 볼 수 잇습니다 平壤을 가면 路傍賣食男女가 더 만흔듯하지요?
K兄. 이러한 惡風을 어케 하면 掃蕩할 수 잇슬가요 우리의 知識程度 우리의 生活程度라 하겟지만 이런 것이야 改良 는 善導의 可能性이 잇지 아니합니 그곳그곳의 靑年有志의 活動이면 容易할 듯 합니다 傍觀하지는 決코 못합니다 그 地方 그 民族의 體面보아서도 決코 不知에 付할수는 업다하나이다 그들의 自覺을 기다리거나 當局者들의 好意도 바랄수 업습니다 當局者들은 걸핏하면 衛生이니 淸潔이니 하면서도 이러한데는 족음도 用意를 아니합니다 『요놈들 너의 蠻風을 廣告할대로 해봐라 우리에게는 損害-半分업다』하고 속으로 조하만하는 것이 事實이외다
K兄. 우리는 무어니무어니해도 地方細民의 이러한 細事를 보는 대로 當하는 대로 말하고 우고 고치고함이 가장 意味깁흔듯하야 이 事實을 들엿나이다
K兄. 木浦 木浦臺의 月夜는 景致로보다 實로 放歌大躍할듯하나 傷心이 猶多하메 放聲大哭할번 하얏나이다 儒達山岩石이 大責을 下하는 듯하며 孤霞島松林이 (李忠武의 碑文이 有함) 愁色을 인 듯 하더이다 整然하고 潤活한 日本人市街를 보고 저-北橋洞一隅에 너저분한 우리 同胞의 市井을 볼 그만 火가 나서 주먹만 두어번 비틀고 말왓나이다
群山와서도 亦是 木浦와 一樣이엇습니다 但一夜로써 群山公園에서 單獨히 感하고 傷할이엇나이다 아무대도 開港場이란 朝鮮人에 對한 記錄이 別로 적어짐은 말할수업는 恨事입니다

K兄. 이것은 江景平野一隅인 論山郡恩津面南山里에서 본 農事契(一名豊物)即＜89＞
두레먹이라는 大快事 極興致의 놀음이외다 平安道나 咸鏡道가튼 地方에는 農村에 이러한 風俗이 업습니다만 京畿以南三南各地方에는 이러한 風俗 即 『두레먹이』라는 것이 만히 流行됩니다
봄 모내일라든지 여름 기음맬라든지 京畿或三南地方에를 가면 村中이나 或農場에서 旗ㅅ발이휘날리며 막이소리 小鼓소리가 搖亂히 남을 듯고 볼수잇습니다 처음보는 이는 저것이 무슨 놀음인가 神仙놀음이나 아닌가하고 매우 疑心도 하며 神奇하게도 생각키웁니다 그리하야 行步를 中止하고 이윽히 구경하는 이도 잇고 갓가이 하가서 억개춤지 추는 이가 잇습니다 그러나 이놀음이 이 어한 놀음인지는 容易히 모릅니다 나도 이것을 二三次나 구경하고 그저-農事契놀음이거니만알고 그-仔細한 것은 몰랏든 터입니다 마츰 이곳을 와서『두레먹이』의 內幕을 알고보니 果然 農村의 美風이며 널리 자랑할 만한 것입니다
바로 내가 南山里에 간 그날이 이 南山里 『두레먹이』날입니다 親舊 K君은 이 洞里農契의 頭目이라 합니다 그래서 頭目의 집마당에 農民全部가 모여 神農遺業이라 大書한 큰 旗를 자노코 喇叭을 불며 小鼓와 북을 치며 막이와 증을 울리며 막느그러지게 노는데 참-可觀이러이다 패랑이에 花環을 달아쓰고 응덩춤을 추는 이도 잇고 나비服色 는 處女幻裝을 한 花童들은 억개춤을 一手잘추며  고쓴 上子色의 技童들은 무동춤도 추며 어 이는 장춤 어 이는 새우춤 눈짓 입짓 손짓이 참 長短에 마저 어지는 것은 劇場 以上의 大奇觀이더이다 한참 놀다가는 一大白式이나  들여마시고  놀군하는데 낫으로 밤지 洞內가 나가듯이 야단스럽게 놀더이다 이『두레먹이』가 어느 어케 始作되엇는지 그-來歷은 모르나 一種軍隊式農契인데 봄에 모내기 前臨時하야 農民全部가 洞會를 열고 그해에 對한 頭目一人과 公員一人을 選擧한다 합니다 이해는 農事上 는 洞事上 이 頭目의 指揮를 밧게된다 하는데 이 두레라는 것은 農民全部가 들어부터 어 집일이고 順次로 하루式하고 그-賃金은 農會의 公金으로하야 洞中公共事에 쓰며  樂器買入修繕等 모든 公用에 費하며 는 이 두레먹이날 가튼  公費들 한다 합니다
두레난다는 날은 어 집일을 하게된다는 날인데 頭目이 發論을 하야 오늘은 아모의 일을 할터이니 다-나라고 農民一般에게 令을 나린다합니다(아니나지는 ＜90＞못함) 그리고 일집에서는 私事로이 할 마음이 잇스나 아니바들 수 업게 된다 합니다 (아무 격거도 한번은 치를 터이니)두레ㅅ軍들이 農場으로 向할 時는 令旗 龍旗 (神農遺業)을 압세우고 喇叭一雙 小鼓一雙 막이 一雙 중 一個 長鼓一介 大鼓一個가 連해 흐며 상쇠잡이 (先頭막이) 指揮下에 軍隊式으로 거려 나아간다 합니다 農場에 가서는 旗를 자노코 一齊히 김매기를 始作하는데 북과 막이치는 사람 二三人이 로나서 김군의 뒤를 하단이며 速히매라 느리게해라 뒤어진 者에게는 모라치고 압선 者에게 느리게 쳐준다 합니다 그리하면 모다 興이나서 어나 잘매는지 한마지기 두마지기가튼 것은 눈할새 다-매여버린다합니다 그러케 한참매고 나서는 一大白式이나하고 담배를 한 대式 은 뒤에 들어부터 한참 興致잇게 다가 매고 매고 한다는데 盡日가도 疲困한 줄 모르고 元氣旺盛하야 農夫歌만 불은다 합니다
K兄. 참-조흔 風俗이지요? 그리고
『두레먹이날』은 一年春秋二次인데 이날은 頭目이 그해의 벌은 金錢에서 公用에 쓰고 남을 것에 하 쌀과 고기를 몃 石이고 몃 貫을 사드려서 每戶에 分配를 시킨다합니다 一年間만히 애쓰고  돈들도 잘벌고 豊年도 젓스니 하루 동안 잘 먹고 잘 놀자는 意味이외다 웨 頭目이 사서 分配를 시키느냐 하면 돈을 주어 各各自意대로 해먹고 놀자하면 或잘먹고 或아니먹는 不平均이 잇슬가 念慮하야 一致平均主義로 그리한다 합니다 그리고 이『두레먹이』ㅅ날은 집집이 沐浴을 하고 새옷을 입고 안팟글 掃除하며 우물을 가시며 道路를 쓸며하야 大淸潔을 한뒤에 洞中第一安穩無故한 집을 가리어 土地神 大祭를 行하고 그리고나서 各自家대로 잘먹고 잘고 잘논다 합니다 春秋二大淸潔이란 此以上에 더-할 者-업다합니다 그리한뒤에 男子들은 頭目의 집이나 或-大家에 모여 盡日 밤새도록 二日或三日을 佚宕하게 노는데 이날의 술이란 農事多少에 하 義務로 家家에서 提供하는데 三十斗家는 三十器 二十斗家는 二十器 五斗家는 五器 집집이 모다내인다합니다 이리하야 一年二次式 擧洞共樂을 한다합니다 이리하야 一年二次式 擧洞共樂을 한다 합니다 果然 美風이더이다
K兄. 나는 이것을 朝鮮方方谷谷에 다-宣傳하고 십습니다 여러 가지로보아 美風인듯합니다 親睦으로 慰安으로 團體力으로 다-利할듯하더이다 그런데 이것으로 말미암아 洞里洞里의 勢力競爭이 如＜91＞干아니라합니다 農旗와 農旗가 맛나면 서로 길을 아니 避하고 서로 禮하라고 是非를 하다가 大戰爭도 起하며 甚하면 殺人지 난다 합니다 以前은 매우 甚하얏는데 至今은 좀 順해젓다합니다

K兄. 나는 이 農村에서 이러한 快事美風을 보고 그-이튼날 恩津彌勒佛을 보고 論山장구경을 하고 豆溪停車場에서 나러 鷄龍山禹跡골이라는 山中 어 草屋에서 밤을 지나고 그이튼날 鳩嶺을 넘어 東鶴寺, 甲寺, 新元寺를 보고  그이튼날 即 오늘 아츰에 이 新都안이를 왓나이다

K兄. 恩津의 灌燭寺 大石佛은 東洋的, 아니 世界的大名物로, 其名이 村婦野童에게지 미첫스니 여긔에는 略하겟스며 論山장은 무엇보다 飮食장이라함이 可하겟더이다 (路傍食店) 그런데 禹跡골이라는 대서는 하마터면 죽을 번하얏소이다 마츰 論山서부터 尨村兄을 맛나 同行이되엇스나 初行山中이라 路次도 모르는데 날지 저물엇습니다 어둡고 險路임을 不拘하고 東鶴을 넘으려할  마츰 山家의 好農老를 맛나 好意의 挽留로 一夜를 山家안방에서 지나엿는데 이튼날 구턱재(鳩嶺)를 넘어보니 엇저녁 그 老人이 아니드면 벌서 콩가루가 되어 저-개천에 어저 잇슬 것이엇습니다 果然 險하더이다
東鶴 甲寺이약이도 略하고(九月號編輯當時에 某氏의 鷄龍山遊記가 編入됨을 아는 故로)이제 이
迷信의 王窟-新都안이 이약이를 좀하고 치겟나이다

K兄. 鷄龍山-하면 都邑을 聯想하며 鄭哥를 聯想하며 趙哥를 聯想하며  侍天敎를 聯想케 됨이 우리의 普通일 듯 합니다 내가 줌억위부터 鷄龍山에 都邑된다는 이약이를 귀가 압흐도록 들엇거니와 近來에 와서 그말은 더욱 熾盛이 되어 不在三年이니 甲子應當이니하야 傳之聞之에 其說이 頻頻한 데다가 더군다나 侍天敎人이 幾萬名이 移寓를 하얏느니 金龜菴이 新宮을 宏壯히 지엇느니 車天子가 基地를 奠하얏느니 別別怪聞怪說이 만히 流行되매 그것이 事實일가 風說일가 어하얏든 迷信家의 妄說인줄을 알면서도 한번 親往親見할밧게업다하고 밧분길이지만 二日을 費하야 所謂都邑터라는 新都안이를 들럿나이다＜92＞
K兄. 놀라지마시오 都邑與否는 姑捨하고 듯든말은 事實입니다 侍天敎人이 四五千名모엿고 新築한 戶數로만해도 千餘戶가넘습니다 宮인지 殿인지 金龜菴宿泊室이라는 宏壯한 新築物도 잇고 侍天敎傳敎室  學校지 잇고 三部落으로된 新市街가 잇서 어지간한 邑內보다 낫습니다 西門巨里 東門巨里가 잇고 鍾路가 잇고 宮터가 잇고 帝子峰이 잇고  李太祖의 遺物인지 柱石이 잇고하야 廢都라면 廢都, 新都라면 新都의 感이 업지 못하외다
地勢로 보면 저-全羅道長水의 大屯山 (一名 한점山) 一脉이 北으로 論山을 쑥건너와 所謂 西門재라는 鷄龍山西脉이 되고 다시 웃둑소사 鷄龍山 主峰이 되고 主峰에서 東으로 弓形가티 휘둘러 豆溪로 直走한 一脉이 잇고  南으로 충충 여 所謂 新宮의 主峰帝子峰이 되엇습니다 迷信家나 風水眼으로 보면 그럴 듯이 되엇다 하겟나이다 左靑龍 右白虎니 雙龍弄珠形이니 金鷄抱卵形이니 山太極水太極이니 (水는 錦江水가 亦長水에서 發源함에서 鷄龍爲名도 此意에서 出하얏다 云) 하야  들게 되엇습니다  한便으로 보면 사람이 兩手를 벌려 무엇을 안으려하는 感도 잇기는 잇습니다 如何間 山勢는 꼭 新都의 說을 做出하게만 되엇습니다 그래그런지 어니에게 鷄龍山求景을 왓다하니 그는 將來의 政丞 判書를 어루만지며 希望에 넘치는 말로『地理낫치나하셧스면 어는지 容易히 모르지요 山勢볼줄모르면 헛구경이지요 참 잘생겻습니다』하고 富家의 先墓에 려간 風水놈의 말하듯 합니다 그래 그의 心理를 좀더 興舊시키노라고『나도 地理에 그러케 疎忽치는 안흔데 참잘생겻습니다』하고 對句를 노코『언제 都邑이돼야지』라고 語尾를 다니 그는 『차차되지오 萬古大運이 어 그러케 쉽다구요』하며 멋업시조하함을 보앗나이다
그러나 俗眼 아니 兒童에게 무러도 都邑은 커녕 村排布도 못하겟나이다 本來 局內가 삼태기(簣)안만한데다가 宮터 鍾路자리라는 곳이 족음 놉즉하고는 鷄龍山 東西山谷에서 흐르는 左右개천은 돌파모레로 乾川을 이루어 農事도 못 지어먹게 되엇습니다  山谷인지라 交通不便上 장사도 못 할 아조 不農不商의 地입니다 어이에게 이말을 하니 그는 조치못한 氣色으로『都邑되면 잘맨들지오 어대 本來 조흔 곳이 잇답듸 移山移水하는 이 時代에-』하고 픽돌아섭니다 그러키도할듯합니다 이런것을 보면 이곳에 모＜93＞인 그들에게는 擧皆迷信의 網이 全身을 잡아싼듯하나이다
어 草家에 들러 집석이 삼는 侍天敎人에게 人事를 請하고『왜-이 不農不商의 薄地에 모여와서 苟且함을 當하느냐』무르니 그는 『이것이 偵探이나 아닌가』하고 매우 疑心스러운 눈으로 한참이나 흘겨보더니『그저-아모 意味업시 남들이 다-오니 왓습니다』하고는 하며 신날만 죄입니다 어대서 왓느냐 무르니 黃海道라하며 이곳에 어느곳 사람이 第一만히 왓느냐하니 大槪는 黃海道며 그다음은 平安道라합니다 農事하느냐하니 못한다하며 무엇가지고 生活하느냐하니 집석이이나삼고 처음 왓스니 모든 것이 이모양이라 할입니다 나는 다시『그래도은 原因이 잇겟지오 어한 動機로 오셧서요』하니- 연줄이 무엇인지『연줄연줄하야 왓슬이라』고만합니다 果然 딱한 그들이러이다 門밧게는 沈단근감(柿) 몃 個式 버려노코 房에서는 집석이을 삼으며 往來人의 얼굴만 쳐다보며 糊口의 末由함으로 隱然히 哀願하는 듯하더이다
K兄. 나는 計家하다 심히 巨里를 巡廻하야 傳敎室 學校 本願寺 는 흔들린다는 趾石돍을 보고 彼-宿泊室을 求景하얏습니다 一二丈式되는 大石柱에 材木도 아람이 넘는 것으로 싀골하고는  宏壯히 짓습듸다 至今도 敎人들이모여 賦役을 하는데 언제나 落成이 될지 모른다하며 預算도 貳萬圓이들 아즉 모른다하며 石材는 鷄龍山에서 採出하고 木材는 水原에서 運搬하얏다하며 侍天敎總部에서 金錢이 오긴하나 大槪는 敎人들의 義務出役이라 합니다
K兄. 內幕이 分明히 잇겟지마는 中傷的이 될가봐 못쓰겟소이다 는 新來의 同胞가 오즉 希望하나으로 生命을 連해가는 데 참아 그의 秘密은 公開치 못하겟소이다(모르기도 하려니와) 본대로 들은대로 事實들엇소이다 그런데
K兄. 鷄龍山都邑說이 왜 낫는지 아십니 아는 말이지만 말하든 이니 잠간 이약이하겟습니다
李太祖-第士鄭道傳으로 더불어 大事를 經營할  雄計와 奇略이 多方面이엇슴은 우리가 推知하겟시죠 그들은 일즉이 新都를 漢陽에 卜하고 그 地가 舊都의 松都와 近하며  人心이 自己에 歸服치 아니함을 憂하야 그윽히 漢陽의 東十里許에 「往十里」의 三字를 刻한 砥石을 埋하고 衆人歸服의 前計로 先히 鷄龍山東便에 來하야 宮城을 築하노라 三日大役을 하얏습니다 當＜94＞然-假老婆인지 山한머니인지 장사 老婆가 三日間連해와서 李太祖에게을 팔앗습니다 三日만에는 老婆-李祖에게말하야 曰『이은 鄭氏이거늘 그대 徒勞하도다 그대은 漢陽이어니 須速漢陽去를 』하고는 仍急不見이엇습니다 이것이 太祖의 奇計中 하나이엇스나 衆人은 감가티속엇습니다 太祖는 이로부터 聲言하야 曰『鷄龍山神한 머니가 予를 漢陽으로 指示하얏도다 그는 神이라 어異言이 有하리오 我運은 從此大通하리라하야 크게 宣傳하는 一面으로 鷄龍山神堂을 세워 神祭하며 鄭道傳과하야 鄭堪錄等異書를 作하야 當時不平人으로 멀리 幾百年後로 斷念케 하는 等-實로 그 計-百出이엇든것이 事實이외다 此가어 李太祖故意作事가아니리오마는 人民은 속아왓습니다 傳하고 傳하기를 五百年後 鄭氏都邑乎鷄龍山이라하며 그리고 山上에 異言을 劃하며 童謠를 傳하며 奇書를 作하야 衆心을 歸服시켯슴이 事實이외다
K兄. 趙氏都邑說이 하나잇소이다 옛적어趙氏의 義子가 그-義父의 恩惠를 갑기로하고 地理工夫를 잘하야 그의 墓를 擇하고나서 稱하야 曰 着根於松都 發葉於漢陽 開化於鷄龍 結實於伽倻라한것이 亦鷄龍都邑說의 하나외다 그런데
近來侍天敎人이 此地로 多聚함은 한 一說이잇다하는데 同敎敎主金龜菴의 龜字가 同敎大神師-降詩中 龜岳春回一世花의 句와 相副相應한다하야 龜菴國師의 意로 同敎人이 鷄龍山으로 多聚한다고 어이가 傳합니다 駭怪한 酬酌이 넘우만흐니 一一이 記憶할수도업고  紹介할 價値도 업습니다 그저 한번 웃고 말이라하나이다
