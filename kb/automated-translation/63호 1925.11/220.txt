As everyone in the world knows, this magazine (本誌) had its August issue confiscated (押收) on August 1st and simultaneously had its publication suspended. Since then (伊來), for two or three months, we have been in a state of disconnection (絶綠狀態) from our readers (讀者). Then, on October 15th, the ban was lifted (解禁), and now, on November 1st, we are able to reconnect (綠) with our readers again. Whether this is fortunate or unfortunate, swift or slow, we will not say.

As the ban was lifted in mid-October like this, the editing for the November issue was truly rushed (沮沒). Although it wasn't that we had no preparations originally, all the articles (記事) were quite old. Furthermore, we published an extra edition to widely announce the lifting of the ban, and moreover, the key personnel (主務者) had just returned after going to the provinces (地方), so we were truly at a loss (*鼻莫*). Therefore, rushing headlong, there were inevitably things we couldn't include that should have been, and things we couldn't remove that should have been. We ask for your generous understanding (雅諒).

The report on South Chŏlla Province (全南路査記) is also like that. As the publication was suspended (停刊) during the investigation trip (路査), we inevitably had to stop the trip, and the investigator had to return to the company (歸社). There were many shortcomings midway (中道) through the investigation, and furthermore, what value could there be in publishing it after letting it sit for two or three months? It was unfortunate (不幸) for our company, and South Chŏlla (全南) also missed its timing. We ask for your generous understanding (雅諒) a second time.

This time, the Anti-Christianity Issue (反基督敎問題) has been treated with particular importance. Observing that on one hand, Sunday Schools (主日學校) are being held盛況 successfully (盛況), while on the other hand, anti-Christian sentiment (反基督敎主義) is growing fiercely (熾盛), this magazine has treated this importantly as a reference for both sides. We ask for a read (一讀) from everyone, regardless of whether they are believers or non-believers (敎人非敎人).

The year Eulchuk (乙丑年, 1925) is also drawing to a close. Only one month remains. What shall we do for the Eulchuk Year-End Issue (送年號)? While seeking opinions (意見) from afar, we also ask for many submissions (投稿) in advance.

To celebrate (自祝) the resumption of publication (繼刊), we have edited this as an enlarged issue (增大號). However, the price (定價) has been kept as for a regular issue (送別號 - *Translator's note: Likely means 'regular issue price' or perhaps 'farewell to suspension price', context suggests the former*). We had intended to include "Recent Impressions of Various People" (最近의 各人各感) starting from this issue, but due to circumstances, it will be included from the next issue (次號). We thank (謝) the few people who sent in their impressions.<46>

**Summary**

This editor's postscript from the November 1925 issue of *Kaebyŏk* magazine explains the reasons for the issue's rushed compilation. The magazine had been suspended by authorities on August 1st, only resuming publication after the ban was lifted on October 15th. The editors apologize for the potential lack of quality due to the short preparation time, the inclusion of older articles, and the recent return of key staff from provincial trips. They specifically mention the interruption and delay of a report on South Chŏlla Province and highlight the issue's focus on the contemporary debate surrounding anti-Christianity, presenting it as a reference for both Christians and non-Christians. The postscript concludes by asking for reader input and submissions for the upcoming year-end issue and notes that a planned new section has been postponed.

From a historical perspective, this article vividly illustrates the precarious existence of Korean publications under Japanese colonial censorship, detailing the suspension and subsequent rushed resumption of *Kaebyŏk*. It offers insight into the practical challenges faced by the editorial team. Furthermore, its focus on the anti-Christianity movement as a major topic reflects the social and intellectual currents of 1920s Korea, making it a valuable snapshot of the period's concerns and the magazine's role in addressing them.

餘言
天下가 다 아는 바와 가티 本誌는 지난 8월 1일로써 8월호가 押收되는 同時 겸하야 발행정지를 당하여 伊來 2,3개월을 讀者와 絶綠狀態에 잇섯다. 그러다가 지난 10월 15일로써 다시 解禁이 되야 이제 11월 1로써 讀者와 다시 *綠을 닛게 되얏다. 幸不幸과 遲速 여하는 말하지 안햇다.

이와 가티 10월 중순에 해금이 된지라 11월호 편집은 실로 沮沒하얏다. 본래 예비가 업섯든 바는 안이지만 모다가 케케 묵은 記事요. 또는 널리 해금을 알리기 위하야 호외를 발행하얏고 더군다나 主務者들이 地方에를 갓다가 갓 돌아온 터이라 실로 *鼻莫*엿섯다. 그래서 불치듯 덩븨노라고 널울 것 못넛코 뺄 것 못 뺀 것도 업지 안타. 雅諒을 빈다.

全南路査記도 또한 그럿타. 路査 중에 停刊이 되니 부득이 路査를 중지하고 路査員이 歸社케 되얏다. 路査 중도에 미흡이 만흔데다가 또 2,3個月 묵켯다가 기재하니 무엇이 변변하랴. 本社도 不幸이엿거니와 全南도 때를 못 맛난 셈이다. 두번째 雅諒을 빈다.

이번은 反基督敎問題가 별로 중요히 취급 되얏다. 한 개에는 主日學校가 盛況으로 開催되고 한편으로는 反基督敎主義가 熾盛됨에 鑑하야 本誌는 위선 양편의 참고로 이것을 중요하게 취급하얏다. 敎人非敎人을 막론하고 一讀을 빈다.

乙丑年도 또 저믈어간다. 이제 한달만 지나면 그만이다. 乙丑 送年號는 엇더케 할고 멀리 意見을 구하는 同時 또한 만흔 投稿를 비러 둔다.

繼刊을 自祝하기 위하야 增大號로 編輯하얏다. 그러나 定價는 送別號로 두엇다. 이번 號부터 「最近의 各人各感」을 넛키로 하야섯스나 형편에 의하야 그는 次號부터 실게 되얏다. 感想 적어 보낸 몇 분에게 謝한다.＜46＞
