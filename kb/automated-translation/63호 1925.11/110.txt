**Summary**

This brief notice from the publisher, Kaepyŏk-sa, announces the appointment of Mr. Kim Ch'ŏl-san as a reporter for the magazine. He is specifically assigned to cover the Maritime Province (Yŏnhaeju) region, noted as his homeland. This reflects the magazine's journalistic reach and interest in the significant Korean population residing in the Russian Far East during the Japanese colonial period. Historians might find this indicative of the magazine's scope, its connection to the Korean diaspora, and the perceived importance of the Maritime Province as a news source or area of concern for Koreans at the time.
