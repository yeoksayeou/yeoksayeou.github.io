I welcome the birth of "Kaebyŏk" into the Korean magazine world with great joy. It is said that today, nothing is more essential to the youth of Korea than learning. Just as our physical body lives by eating fresh food, what must we consume to cultivate and develop our mind and spirit? Without question, our mind and spirit must be cultivated by consuming good learning. I believe that "Kaebyŏk" will be capable of evoking true pleasure for its many readers. I also wish and hope that it becomes a magazine central to high knowledge and pure morality, and that it also becomes popular and moderate. Please guarantee that its future will be greatly promising by guiding society with this purpose. I introduce it to all thoughtful readers and wish for its great success.

**Summary**

This article is a congratulatory letter from E. M. Cable, President of the Union Methodist Theological Seminary, welcoming the first issue of the magazine "Kaebyŏk" (개벽). He emphasizes the crucial role of good literature and learning ("學問") in the development of Korean youth's minds, comparing mental nourishment to physical sustenance. He expresses his hope that the magazine will provide genuine joy, uphold high intellectual and moral standards, and also be accessible ("popular and moderate"), guiding society toward a promising future. From a historical perspective, this letter is significant as it shows Western missionary support for a Korean cultural and intellectual endeavor during the early colonial period (just after the 1919 March First Movement). It highlights the perceived importance of publications like "Kaebyŏk" in fostering knowledge, morality, and potentially national consciousness among the Korean youth under Japanese rule. The Korean translation's subtle differences from the English original (e.g., emphasizing "learning" over "literature", adding "popular and moderate") might also interest historians studying cultural translation and reception in colonial Korea.

Editor of The Kai Pyuk, Seoul, Chosen.
Dear Sir; ―
It gives me great pleasure to welcome into the field of Journalism the Kai Pyuk. Nothing is more important to the youth of Korea than good wholesome literature. As the body lives upon what it eats so the mind grows and develops by what it digests. Give it pure, wholesome food. In this new age the minds of Korea's young ought to have the very best literature. I trust the new Journal will be a veritable boon to all its readers. I beg of you from the very begining to make the Journal of high intellectual and moral tone. Stoop to nothing that is mean and vulgar. Gaurding carefully these points you will be assured of a very large and useful future. I commend the Jourual to all thoughtful readers, with best wishes for great success, I am,
Very sincerely yours,
E. M. Cable
Pres. Union Methodist Theologieal Seminary.

나는 朝鮮 雜誌界에 「開闢」이 誕生함을 매우 기쁨으로써 歡迎하나이다. 今日에 朝鮮 靑年에게 가장 有益함은 學問보다 더 緊要한 것이 업다하나이다. 우리의 肉身이 生活함에는 新鮮한 食物을 먹거니와 心神을 修養하고 發展케 하랴면 무엇을 먹어야 하오릿가? 이는 무를 것 업시 우리의 心神은 조흔 學問을 먹어서 修養하여야 할지로다. 나는 「開闢」이 能히 여러 讀者에게 眞實한 快樂을 喚起할 줄로 밋노이다. 그가 또한 高尙한 智識과 純潔한 道德의 中心되는 雜誌가 되며, 그가 또한 通俗的, 中庸的이 되기를 빌고 바라나이다. 그가 이러한 目的으로 社會를 指導하야 그의 將來가 크게 有望하기를 擔保하소서. 나는 모든 有志 讀者에게 그를 紹介하오며 그의 크게 成功함을 願하나이다.
