기사제목	금쌀악 (Golden Cry / Cry of Preciousness)
기사형태	시 (Poem)

The crow, realizing how precious a home is in the North Wind and Cold Snow, cries "House! House!" (家屋家屋).

Like those who have nests but don't live in them (有巢不居), it cries "Shameful! Shameful!" (可恥可恥), ashamed of the name 'home'.

The cricket in the Autumn hall under the Bright Moon, perhaps having lost its home, cries out from over there, "Lost! Lost! Lost! Lost!" (失失失失).<37>

**Summary**

This poem uses the cries of animals—a crow in winter lamenting the value of a home and feeling shame, and a cricket in autumn mourning a lost home—to express feelings of displacement and loss. The animals' cries, represented phonetically or through Hanja characters (家屋, 可恥, 失), emphasize the sorrow associated with lacking or losing a home. From the perspective of Korean colonial history, this poem is interesting as it likely serves as an allegory for the loss of national sovereignty and the sense of displacement and shame felt by Koreans under Japanese rule. Historians might find its indirect expression of suffering and longing for a 'home' (nation) significant, reflecting how sentiments were conveyed under censorship.
