Jokes/Fables

1. The Oyster Lawsuit
One day, travelers were walking along a road and saw an oyster on the seashore (海邊). As one person was about to pick it up, a companion said, "Hey, wait a moment. Between the two of us, who rightly gets to eat that oyster?" "Ah, well, the person who saw it first should eat it, and the person who saw it next should just watch, shouldn't they?" "If that's the case, my eyes are quite sharp." "You only saw it, but I even touched it, so what should we do?" As they were arguing with each other (彼此), a certain nobleman (兩班) passed by, and the two travelers asked him to make a judgment (判決) in their oyster lawsuit. The nobleman shucked the oyster, swallowed the inside, and gave one half of the shell to each of them, saying, "For your actions (所爲), you should be made to pay the lawsuit expenses (浮費), but I forgive (容恕) you and give you each an oyster shell, so say nothing more and go."
Reconciling and getting half is better than going to court and losing everything.

2. Judging by Appearances
One day, a fox was walking down a road and reached a place where many people had gathered, looking at and praising a human figure (人形) carved from granite (화반석). The fox watched for a while, then turned to leave, saying, "The appearance is fine, but I worry that there's nothing inside."
What would this fox say if it saw the idle wanderers (부랑자) of today?

3. The Cat and the Monkey
A cat and a monkey lived together affectionately in one house, but their mischief was incessant (무쌍하야). The monkey stole everything it saw, and the cat had no interest in catching mice but only frequented the cupboard. One day, seeing chestnuts roasting in the brazier, the monkey called the cat and said, "Brother, if you took out those roasted chestnuts, we could both eat well, but my hands are not as skillful (재지) as yours, so you take them out." Hearing this, the cat pushed aside the ashes in the brazier <128> and took out the chestnuts one by one. As soon as they were laid out, the monkey peeled and ate them. Just then, the owner came in; the cat only got its paws burned, didn't even taste the chestnuts, and fled.
People who do not do their own work (自己) themselves, but mindlessly run errands for others that are not proper (正當), should see this cat's situation and think a little.

4. The Deer's Antlers
One day, a deer was drinking water by a stream and saw the reflection of its antlers in the water. Admiring them, it said, "My antlers are magnificent. Looking at my antlers, I am the most beautiful creature, but it's vexing that my legs are like poles." As it lamented, suddenly a hunting dog pursued it. Its legs, which it had scorned (업시여기던), ran like flying, and it almost escaped the dangerous situation (危境), but its antlers got caught in tree branches, preventing it from fleeing, and it was caught. The deer sighed and said, "Caring only for outward appearance (外面) ruins the body."
Do not make friends based only on outward appearance.

5. Strength and Weakness Differ (强弱不同)
A lion (주지), a calf, a goat, and a sheep started a joint venture (同事) in hunting. They promised (約束) that if any of the four caught an animal, the four partners would divide it equally. One day, a deer was caught in a trap set by the goat. As promised, the partners were summoned. The lion divided the deer into four portions, took one portion, and said, "My name is Lion (주지), so this portion is mine. I am the strongest among us, so the second portion is also mine. I am the bravest among us, so the third portion is also mine. As for the fourth portion, whoever wants to die can touch it," and ate it all.
Do not partner (同事) with those who are strong but lack righteousness (道理).

6. The Man with Four Daughters (四兄弟 - lit. Four Brothers, used here for daughters)
There was a man who named all four of his daughters after object names (物名). After having the first daughter, thinking one was fitting (맛당하다고), he named her Irui (一宜, meaning 'One Suitable', with 狼 - wolf - noted in parentheses). After having the second daughter, thinking two was excessive (甚하다고), he named her Isim (二甚, meaning 'Two Excessive', with 螭 - hornless dragon - noted). After having the third daughter, thinking 'Heh - leaving/placing a third' (헤-셋은 둔다고), he named her Samchi (三置, meaning 'Three Placed', with 鮪 - tuna - noted). After having the fourth daughter, thinking 'How much more you!' (하몰며 너히랴 하야), he named her Hwangsa (况四, meaning 'Moreover Four', with 鸛 - stork - noted). Only then did he truly believe that humans cannot bear children according to their own will, but that there is definitely one who assigns (점지하여) and sends them. <129>

**Summary**

This article presents six short fables or anecdotes ("Sohwa") offering moral lessons. The stories include: travelers losing an oyster due to a dispute resolved cleverly by a nobleman; a fox criticizing a beautiful but empty statue; a cat tricked by a monkey into retrieving chestnuts, getting burned while the monkey eats them; a deer proud of its antlers but saved by its legs, only to be caught by its antlers; a lion taking all shares of a hunt through intimidation; and a man humorously naming his four daughters based on his increasing exasperation, finally accepting fate. The morals emphasize practicality, substance over appearance, self-reliance, caution against exploitation by the powerful, and acceptance. For historians studying colonial Korea, these fables published in *Kaebyŏk*, a magazine associated with the nationalist Ch'ŏndogyo movement, might reflect subtle social commentary. They could be interpreted as reinforcing traditional Korean values, critiquing superficiality or collaboration, warning against the abuse of power (resonant under colonial rule), and encouraging resilience among Koreans facing hardship.
