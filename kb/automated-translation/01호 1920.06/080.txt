On Hearing of the Inaugural Issue of Kaebyŏk
						Pak Yŏnghyo

The Creator (造化主) created the universe, causing Man to be born and Things to exist; this is called Kaebyŏk (開闢, Creation/Opening). Whether Kaebyŏk was creation or completion (落成), what exists imaginatively and substantially are: first, Heaven (天); second, Man (人); and third, Things (物). The Three Powers (三才) of Heaven, Earth [implied], and Man signify this.

That which has neither square form nor end, which is looked for but not seen, listened for but not heard, is called Heaven. Heaven is the Creator who created Heaven, Earth, and all myriad things. Its exaltedness is incomparable; it must be revered, and one cannot act recklessly against it. That which has spiritual nature mutually connected and feelings mutually trusting, having no end but having limits, is called Man. Man has a unique spirit (靈魂) and is the most precious among the myriad things. Their kind is the same; they must be loved universally and cannot be separated. That which relies on the void in substance and operates marvels in the mundane, having physical form and limits, is called Things. Things are created by Heaven to be supplied for Man's use. Their use is inexhaustible; they must be cherished and cannot be discarded. The purpose of creation is profound and great, and the phenomenon of Kaebyŏk is distinct and brilliant.

Though these three are separately named as three, in reality, they are pierced by one principle. If one does not know Heaven, one errs and lacks truth, the nature of reverence, benevolence, and goodness (夤畏仁善) becomes faint and easily lost. If one does not understand Man clearly, one becomes scattered and without order, the heart of friendship, respect, and unity perishes and is almost exhausted. If one does not investigate Things, one becomes poor and helpless, the use of natural qualities and materials falls into ruin and ceases to exist. However, the human heart turns its back on truth and loses reality. Anything strange on mountain peaks or watersides is designated as a god (神). Images are sculpted and worshipped with rites, so the country is filled with objects of mud and wood carvings, equal in number to the sands of the Ganges. The spirits of the sun, moon, wind, and thunder are worshipped everywhere, and the ghosts of the four rivers and five mountains are offered rites everywhere. This is the height of foolishness and the extreme of darkness.<30> This is erring regarding Heaven. Furthermore, in the social state, suspicion fills hearts, leading to mutual resentment and harm. Even flesh and blood fight, and hands and feet [siblings] quarrel. Officials rely on authority to oppress the people, the rich rely on money to scorn the poor, the noble slight the lowly, men demean women, prostitutes are sold, maids are bought, concubines are kept, and wives are neglected. This is erring regarding Man. Moreover, upon seeing marvelous devices and strange tools created by others, one merely says, "How talented!" without delving into the principles behind them. Though beauty and utility lie in craftsmanship, we cannot manufacture; though great treasures lie in the earth, we cannot seek and use them. Thus, materials and resources are not abundant, and the economy is insufficient. This is erring regarding Things. Since these three have already been erred against, what will the result be? Falling behind? Decline and extinction? Ah—we cannot but hope for Kaebyŏk once again.

Break through the common delusions and seek the truth; sweep away the evil customs of old and open the right path. This is the Kaebyŏk concerning Heaven. Interpret ethics with new, daily-renewing thought to fundamentally reform society; respond to the trends with inherent spirit to guide the nation toward the realm of freedom. This is the Kaebyŏk concerning Man. Where principle leads, exhaust thought and effort, not stopping if ignorant; where benefit is hidden, dig the soil and search the rocks, not ceasing if undiscovered, conquering the universe with human wisdom and substituting for creation with human skill. This is the Kaebyŏk concerning Things. In sum, the Kaebyŏk of the Way, the Kaebyŏk of Ethics (倫), the Kaebyŏk of Wealth—this indeed will be the Kaebyŏk that aligns with the original intent of the Creator who created the universe in the beginning.<31>

**Summary**

Pak Yŏnghyo argues that Korean society has fundamentally misunderstood the true nature and relationship of the Three Powers: Heaven (the Creator/universal principle), Man (humanity and society), and Things (the material world/resources). He criticizes contemporary Koreans for superstitious religious practices (misunderstanding Heaven), social ills like hierarchy, oppression, and discord (misunderstanding Man), and failure to develop science, technology, and industry (misunderstanding Things). He calls for a new "Kaebyŏk" (Creation/Opening) in each sphere: establishing true understanding of universal principles, reforming society based on renewed ethics and freedom, and developing the material world through human intellect and effort, aligning with the Creator's original purpose. For historians, this article is interesting as it reflects the intellectual ferment of early colonial Korea, blending traditional cosmology (Three Powers) with urgent calls for modernization and social reform. Written by Pak Yŏnghyo, a controversial figure known for both reformist zeal and later collaboration, it exemplifies the complex ways Korean intellectuals grappled with tradition, modernity, and national survival under colonialism, framing progress within a quasi-religious, cosmological context characteristic of the *Kaebyŏk* magazine's milieu.

開闢의 創刊을 聞하고
						朴永孝
造化主ㅣ宇宙를 創造하야 人을 生케 하고 物을 有케 하니 此를 謂하야 開闢이라 하도다. 開闢은 創造? 落成? 엇지 하얏던지 想像的 實質的으로 存在한 것은 一曰 天이요 二曰 人이요 三曰 物이니 天地人의 三才가 곳 此의 意ㅣ라.
方體도 無하고 窮盡도 無하야 視而不見하고 聽而不聞함을 曰 天이니 天也者는 天地萬物을 創造한 造化主ㅣ라 其尊이 無對하니 맛당히 尊敬하야 妄誤함이 不可하고 性靈이 相屬하고 情意가 相孚하야 窮盡은 無하되 限量이 有한 者를 曰 人이니 人也者는 靈魂이 特有하야 萬物中의 最 貴한 者ㅣ라, 其類가 相同하니 맛당히 汎愛하야 分離치 못할 것이오, 實에 麗虛 하고 庸에 運奇하야 形質이 有하고 限量이 有한 자를 曰 物이니 物也者는 天의 所造로 人의 用에 以供함이라, 其用이 不窮하니 맛당히 珍惜하야 抛棄치 못할 바ㅣ라, 創造의 旨意가 深焉하고 大焉하며 開闢의 現象이 輪然하고 煥然하도다.
此 三者는 名이 비록 別而爲三이나 實은 一以貫之함이라. 天을 知치 못하면 誤而無眞하야 夤畏仁善의 性이 微眇하야 失하기 易하고, 人을 明치 못하면 散而無紀하야 友恭團結의 心이 澌滅하야 殆盡할 것이오, 物을 格치 못하면 貧而無賴하야 氣質材料의 用이 荒廢하야 存함이 無할지라, 然而人心은 眞을 背하고 實을 失하야 山巓水涯에 무릇 奇怪함이 有한 者를 모다 目하야 神이라하고, 形像을 造作하야 敬拜祭祠할 새 國內에 徧滿한 泥塑木彫의 物이 恒河沙의 數와 等하며, 日月風雷의 神을 無所不拜하고 四瀆五嶽의 鬼를 無所不祭하니 愚의 甚함이요 暗의 極함이라.＜30＞ 此는 天을 誤함이요, 또 社會狀態는 疑忌가 滿心하야 相怨相害할 새 骨肉도 相爭하며 手足도 相鬪하야 官은 權을 藉하야 民을 壓하고 富는 金을 賴하야 貧을 蔑하며 貴는 賤을 輕히 하고 男은 女를 卑히 하며 娼을 賣하고 婢를 購하며 妾을 蓄하고 妻를 踈하니 此는 人을 誤함이요, 또 他의 刱作한 奇機異具를 見한 즉 輒曰 有才라 할 뿐이오 其理의 所由는 漫然 不究하야 美利가 工에 在하되 製造치 못하고 至寶가 地에 在하되 探用치 못하야 材用이 富치 못하고 經濟가 足치 못하니 此는 物을 誤함이라, 三者를 이미 誤하얏스니 結果는 如何할가, 落伍? 衰滅? 아-開闢을 다시 望치 아니할 수 업도다.
一般의 迷言을 打破하고 眞理를 究할 것이며, 古來의 악습을 掃除하야 正道를 啓할지어다, 此는 天에 대한 開闢이요, 日新思想으로 倫理를 解釋하야 社會를 根本的으로 改善하고 固有精神으로 風潮를 隨應하야 民族을 自由界로 指導할지어다. 此는 人에 대한 開闢이요, 理가 隨하는 바에는 思를 盡하고 力을 竭하야 不知면 不止하고 利가 隱한 바에는 土를 剔하고 巖을 搜하야 不發이면 不己하야 人智로 宇宙를 征服하고 人工으로 造化를 代行할 지어다. 此는 物에 대한 開闢이라, 總言하면 道의 開闢, 倫의 開闢, 富의 開闢, 此ㅣ곳 造化主가 太初에 宇宙를 創造한 本意에 適合한 開闢이 될 진저.＜31＞
