Funny Story, The Greedy Dog

A dog, having stolen a piece of meat, was crossing a bridge holding it in its mouth when it saw its own reflection in the water. Thinking it was another dog holding a piece of meat, it barked, intending to snatch it away, and the meat it had been holding in its own mouth fell into the water.

A piece of meat in the mouth is better than two pieces of meat in the water. <111>

**Summary**

This article retells the classic fable of the dog and its reflection. A dog carrying stolen meat sees its reflection in the water, mistakes it for another dog with meat, and greedily tries to take the reflected meat, only to lose its own in the process. The moral is explicitly stated: what one actually possesses is better than the illusion of more. From a historical perspective, this simple fable published in *Kaebyŏk*, a prominent intellectual magazine during the Japanese colonial period, might be interpreted as a subtle commentary. Historians could find it interesting as a potential allegory cautioning against unrealistic desires or internal conflicts driven by greed, perhaps reflecting anxieties about division or illusory paths to prosperity/liberation during a difficult time for Koreans.
