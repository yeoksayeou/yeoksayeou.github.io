Dear. Sir:-
You are to be congratulated upon launching into the literary world another magazine that is to have as its aim the distribution of good clean illuminating and uplifting ideas.
Korea has too few magazines with such a purpose and I welcome every effort that is made to meat the already existing need. I do hope that your magazine will prove so helpful that people can-not do without it.
Yours faithfully,

I congratulate you on launching a magazine into the Korean literary world that aims to propagate pure, radiant, and noble ideas.

Korea has too few magazines with such a good purpose. I welcome all efforts made to comply with the demands of the era.

I earnestly hope that your magazine's mission will prove beneficial, so that the general populace comes to regard it as indispensable.

**Summary**

This article is a letter from Hugh Miller of the British and Foreign Bible Society congratulating the publishers of *Kaebyŏk* (개벽) magazine on its first issue. He praises the magazine's aim to spread positive and enlightening ideas, noting the scarcity of such publications in Korea at the time, and expresses hope that it will become essential reading for the Korean people. From a historical perspective, this letter is significant as it shows foreign support (specifically from a Western missionary organization) for a Korean cultural publication during the early Japanese colonial period (just after the 1919 March First Movement). It highlights the perceived need for intellectual and cultural outlets for Koreans under colonial rule and provides a glimpse into the interactions between foreign residents and Korean intellectual circles.
