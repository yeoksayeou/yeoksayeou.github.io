"The day grows dark, I'm hungry, and I have nowhere to go, nowhere to come from. Please let me stay just one night. Take pity on this crippled fellow."

"There's no room. Go away! Hey, beggar!"

"Even the edge of the wooden porch or beside the stable (馬廐間) would be fine. Just one night... I only ask for your benevolent arrangement (거룩한 處分)."

"I told you there's no room. Why are you talking so much? Go away now!"

"Please, save me. I'm too hungry to go anywhere."

"I don't want to hear it. Just go. If I say I won't let you stay, that's the end of it. What more..."

"If you really must, then please give me just a spoonful of rice. Let me just stave off my hunger (療飢) and then I'll go..."

"There's no rice either. Go to another house and beg there."

"I'm not in a condition (形便) to go to another house. The day is getting dark and I'm hungry... Please give me even a bowl of leftover rice or old kimchi."

"Ah, you're so annoying. Go if you're going, don't if you're not..."

The crippled beggar, who had pleaded and begged for one night's lodging (一夜의 宿) and one bowl of rice (一器의 飯).

"Ah- God," he sighed, painfully turning his steps. "That person is human, and I am human, so why me?" <122>

**Summary**

This short piece depicts a harsh encounter between a desperate, crippled beggar seeking shelter and food for the night and an unyielding, callous householder who refuses any form of help. The dialogue starkly contrasts the beggar's polite pleading with the householder's increasingly annoyed and cruel refusals, culminating in the beggar's despairing question about the injustice of his situation compared to others. From the perspective of Korean colonial history, this vignette offers a glimpse into the extreme poverty and social indifference that could characterize the era. Historians might find it valuable as a raw, contemporary portrayal of social stratification, the plight of the marginalized, and the potential breakdown of traditional community support under the pressures of the time, expressed through the lens of social critique common in magazines like *Kaebyŏk* (개벽).
