一. Account of Tan’gun’s Advent

Looking into the legends of Tan’gun, starting from their appearance in Koryŏ literature, we can grasp the outline from the *Samgukji* (三國誌) compiled by Master Ilsŏn (一然) of the Chogye Order (曹溪宗) during the reign of Koryŏ's King Ch'ungnyŏl, and the *Records of Pulguksa Temple in Kyŏngju* (慶州 佛國寺 事蹟) by the same person. Iryŏn wrote the following *Yusa* (Lost Histories) based on the *Kogi* (古記 Old Records):

The *Kogi* states: Long ago, Hwanung (桓雄), the son of the secondary wife of Hwan'guk (桓國) (referred to as Chesŏk [帝釋]), often turned his thoughts toward the human world. The father, knowing his son's intention, looked down upon Samwi (三危) and T'aebaek (太白) [mountains] as suitable places to greatly benefit humanity (弘益人間). Thus, he bestowed upon Hwanung three Heavenly Seals (天符三箇) and dispatched him to rule there. Hwanung led a retinue of three thousand and descended to the summit of Mount T'aebaek (太白山頂) (which is T'aebaek, now Myohyang [妙香]) beneath a sacred sandalwood tree (神檀樹下). This place was called Sinsi (神市), and he is referred to as Hwanung Ch'ŏnwang (桓雄天王 Heavenly King). He governed with the Earl of Wind (風伯), the Master of Rain (雨師), and the Master of Clouds (雲師), presiding over grain, life, punishment, illness, good and evil – overseeing all three hundred and sixty-odd affairs of humankind, ruling and civilizing the world. At that time, there were a bear (熊) and a tiger (虎) living together in the same cave. They constantly prayed to the divine Hwanung, wishing to be transformed into humans. At this time, the deity gave them a stalk of sacred mugwort (靈艾一炷) and twenty cloves of garlic (蒜二十枚), saying, "If you eat these and do not see sunlight for one hundred days, you will attain human form." The bear and tiger received and ate them. Observing the taboo for three times seven days (twenty-one days), the bear obtained a woman's body (女身). The tiger, however, could not maintain the taboo and did not attain a human body. The bear-woman (熊女者) had no one to marry, so she prayed daily beneath the sandalwood tree (檀木下) to conceive. Hwanung then temporarily transformed himself, married her, and she conceived and bore a son. He was called Tan'gun Wan'gŏm (檀君王儉). In the 50th year of Tang Yao (唐堯), the year Musin (戊寅), he established his capital at P'yŏngyang Castle (平壤城) and first named the country Chosŏn (朝鮮). Later, he moved the capital to Paegaksan (白岳山) or Asadalsan (阿斯達山), also called Kwaholsan (夸忽山) or Kŭmmiwi (今彌違). He ruled the country for one thousand five hundred years. When King Mu of Chou (周武王) ascended the throne in the year Kimyo (己卯), he enfeoffed Kija (箕子) in Chosŏn. Tan’gun then moved to Changdanggyŏng (藏唐京). Afterwards, he retreated and hid in Asadalsan, becoming a mountain god (山神). His lifespan is said to have been one thousand nine hundred and eight years.

Based on this, Tan’gun’s birth occurred 4,253 years ago from today.

二. Three Heavenly Seals (天符三印)

It is told in the teachings of Tan’gun that in the beginning, there was no ruler in the East, and the population was sparse. In the vast expanse of nine thousand *li* between Chosŏn, China (支那), and Mongolia (蒙古), primitive people lived in nests or caves (巢居穴處), naked and eating fruits (裸體食實), without established ethical norms (彛倫), no different from beasts. At this time, Tan’gun held the Three Heavenly Seals (天符三印) (representing Past, Present, Future), performed the Method of Spiritual Impartation (胚胎法), and bestowed Spiritual Awareness<61> (靈覺性).

三. Three Gods (三神)

In Korean customs (朝鮮 風習), there has long been a tradition of venerating the Three Gods (三神). The Three Gods refer to Hwanung (桓雄), Hwanin (桓因), and Wan'gŏm (王儉). This is structured much like the Trinity (三位一體說) in Christianity. Hwanung, Hwanin, and Wan'gŏm are three persons in one entity: Hwanung seems to represent the god of the Past, Hwanin the god of the Present, and Wan'gŏm the god of the Future.

四. Kosire (고시레)

In the era of Tan'gun, there was a courtier named Kosirye (高矢禮). He was truly a wise minister. Following Tan'gun's commands and teachings, he reclaimed wastelands and promoted the cultivation of the five grains. The legacy of his beneficence flows down through myriad generations, so that even today, there is a Korean custom (朝鮮 風習) where, upon encountering new food or when farmers eat outdoors in the fields, they chant "Kosire" (고시레).

五. P'eng'o (彭吳)

Among Tan'gun's high officials, alongside Kosirye, was P'eng'o (彭吳), a great man of similar virtue. He distinguished mountains and rivers and demarcated roads, facilitating the administration of the people. Therefore, the current Korean custom (朝鮮 風俗) of building Sŏnghwangdang (城隍堂) shrines by the roadside and erecting Kuksadang (國祀堂) shrines on major mountain passes is, in fact, related to the shrines of this P'eng'o.

六. Sinji (神誌)

Among Tan'gun's courtiers—besides P'eng'o and Kosirye—was a high official named Sinji (神誌). He created written characters and established ethical norms (彛倫), educating the people, thereby first illuminating ethics in the East. (At that time, various evidence suggests the birth of Emperor Shun [舜帝] in China also occurred within Tan'gun's domain [檀君團部中].)

七. Eight Principles (八理)

Tan'gun established three thousand communities (三千團部) across a territory of nine thousand *li* and educated the people using the Eight Principles (八理). The Eight Principles are the eight characters found in scripture: Sincerity (誠), Faith (信), Love (愛), Succor (濟), Misfortune (禍), Fortune (福), Retribution (報), and Response (應). From these eight characters arise three hundred and sixty-six articles.

八. Tan'gun Divine Song (檀君神歌)

During Tan'gun's time, there was a Divine Song (神歌) that became a chant and prayer for the people. The<62> original text is as follows:
어아어아 나리한배금가미고이. 배달나라니리다모. 골잘너나도가오쇼. 어아어아차마무가하라다시거마무니설데다라. 나리골잘다모하라두리온차마무. 구설하니마무온다. 어아어아나리골잘다모하라하니. 무리설데마부리아. 다미온다차마무나. 어아어아나리골잘다모하라고비오마무. 배달날아달이하소. 골잘너나가머고이 나리한배금나리한배금.

Although the details of this Divine Song from that era are still unclear, according to the *Kosa-gi* (古史記 Ancient History Records), it was widely transmitted as a song (歌曲) from the royal court to the villages during the time of King Tongmyŏng (東明王) of Koguryŏ (高句麗). Furthermore, King Kwanggaet'o (廣開土王) used it as a military song (軍歌) whenever going into battle to boost troop morale (軍氣). King Tongmyŏng interpreted the Divine Song as follows:

Ah-ah, Ah-ah, the lofty grace of our Great Imperial Ancestor. We people of Paedal Country (배달國). Let us not forget for hundreds of thousands of millions of years. Ah-ah, Ah-ah, a good heart is the bow, an evil heart is the target (貫射). Our hundreds of thousands of millions of people, a righteous good heart like a bowstring. Like a bowstring, one heart. Ah-ah, Ah-ah, our hundreds of thousands of millions of people. Countless arrows shot from one bow pierce through. In a good heart like boiling water (熱湯), one snowflake is an evil heart. Ah-ah, Ah-ah, our hundreds of thousands of millions of people. Hearts strong as a bow. Are the radiance of Paedal Country. Hundreds of thousands of millions of years of lofty grace. Our Great Imperial Ancestor, Our Great Imperial Ancestor.<63>
<61-63>

**Summary**

This article, published in 1920, recounts the foundational myth of Tan'gun, the legendary founder of Chosŏn (Korea), drawing primarily from Iryŏn's *Samguk Yusa*. It details Tan'gun's divine lineage involving Hwanung and a bear-woman, his establishment of Chosŏn, and key elements associated with his rule: the Three Heavenly Seals (Ch'ŏnbu Sam'in), the concept of the Three Gods (Samsin), the origins of customs like 'Kosire' linked to the minister Kosirye, infrastructure development by P'eng'o, the creation of writing and ethics by Sinji, the Eight Principles (P'alli) of governance, and the ancient 'Tan'gun Divine Song'. From a historical perspective, the article is significant as it was published during the Japanese colonial period. By emphasizing Korea's ancient, distinct mythology, divine origins, unique customs, and indigenous systems of governance and writing predating or contemporary with early Chinese civilization, it implicitly asserts a strong, independent Korean identity and long history, potentially serving as a form of cultural resistance against assimilation policies and the colonial narrative.

檀君神話
						一熊
一. 檀君의 濟生說
檀君의 傳說을 高麗 文獻에 現한바로 始하야 그를 探考하야 보건대 高麗 忠烈王朝에 曹溪宗 方禪師ㅣ 一然의 撰한 三國誌와 同人撰 慶州 佛國寺 事蹟으로 그 大槪를 알게 되엇다. 一然은 古事記에 依하야 左와 如한 遺事를 썻나니
古記云, 昔有桓國(謂帝釋也) 庶子 桓雄, 數意 天下食求人世, 父知子意, 下視三危, 大伯可以弘益人間, 乃授天符三箇, 遣往理之, 雄率徒三千, 降於太白山頂(卽 太白 今 妙香) 神檀樹下, 謂之神市, 是謂桓雄天王也, 將風伯雨師雲師, 而主穀主命主刑主善惡, 凡主人間三百六十餘事, 在世理化, 時有一熊一虎, 同穴而居, 常祈于神雄, 願化爲人, 時神遣靈艾一炷, 蒜二十枚, 爾輩食之, 不見日光, 百日便得人形. 熊虎得而食之, 忌三七日, 熊得女身, 虎不能忌, 而不得人身, 熊女者無爲婚, 故每檀木下呪願有孕, 雄乃假化而婚之, 孕生子, 號曰檀君王儉. 以唐堯五十年戊寅, 都平壤城, 始稱朝鮮, 又移都於白岳山阿斯達山, 又名夸忽山又今彌違, 御國一千五百年, 周武王卽位己卯, 封箕子於朝鮮, 檀君乃移於藏唐京, 後退隱於阿斯達山爲山神, 壽一千九百八歲云.
이로써 보면 檀君의 降生은 距今 四千二百五十三年이엇다.

二. 天符三印

檀君 敎說에 일럿스되 東方에 처음 君長이 업고 人種이 稀少하야 朝鮮, 支那, 蒙古間 九千里 地方에 淼淼茫茫의 間에 巢居穴處의 原人이 裸體食實하야 彛倫이 無함으로 禽獸와 無異한지라. 是時에 檀君이 天符三印(過去, 現在, 未來)를 持하고 胚胎法을 行하고 靈覺性을＜61＞ 賦與하엿다 하니라.

三. 三神
朝鮮 風習에 古來로 三神을 祭하는 風俗이 잇나니 三神이라 함은 卽 桓雄, 桓因, 王儉)이니 이는 마치 基督敎의 三位一體說과 가티 된 것이다. 桓雄, 桓因, 王儉은 一體의 三位를 桓雄은 過去를 代表한 神, 桓因은 現在를 代表한 神, 王儉은 未來를 代表한 神이라는 意味인 듯 하다.

四. 고시레
檀君時代에 侍臣 高矢禮가 잇섯다. 그는 實로 賢臣이엇섯다. 그는 檀君의 命敎를 承하야 荒蕪를 開拓하고 五穀의 農作을 興케 하엿슴으로 그 餘澤이 萬世에 流하야 只今까지 朝鮮 風習에 新飮食을 對하던지 農民이 田圃의 間에서 露食할 時는 「고시레」 하고 呪呼하는 習俗이 잇다.

五. 彭吳
檀君의 高臣으로 고시래와 가티 同德의 大人彭吳가 잇섯다. 그는 山川을 區別하고 道路를 分하야 人民의 行政을 便利케 하엿슴으로 只今 朝鮮 風俗에 道傍에 城隍堂을 築하며 大路 嶺上에 國祀堂을 建함은 卽 其 彭吳의 神祠이엇더라.

六. 神誌
檀君의 侍臣 中―彭吳, 고시레 外에 神誌라 名하는 高臣이 잇섯나니 그는 文字를 制하고 彛倫을 定하야 人民을 敎育하엿슴으로 東方에 彛倫이 始明하엿더라.(其時 支那에 舜帝의 誕降한 諸憑이 亦是 檀君團部中에 在한 것)

七. 八理
檀君은 九千里 地方에 三千團部를 置하고 八理로써 人民을 敎育하엿나니 八理는 卽 聖經中 誠·信·愛·濟·禍·福·報·應 八字요 八字로써 三百六十六條가 生하니라.

八. 檀君神歌
檀君時에 神歌가 잇서 人民의 誦祝이 되엇섯나니 그＜62＞ 原本이 左와 如하다.
어아어아 나리한배금가미고이. 배달나라니리다모. 골잘너나도가오쇼. 어아어아차마무가하라다시거마무니설데다라. 나리골잘다모하라두리온차마무. 구설하니마무온다. 어아어아나리골잘다모하라하니. 무리설데마부리아. 다미온다차마무나. 어아어아나리골잘다모하라고비오마무. 배달날아달이하소. 골잘너나가머고이 나리한배금나리한배금.
右 神歌는 그 時代의 點에서 아즉 未詳하나 古史記를 據컨대 高句麗 東明王時에 歌曲으로써 宮中에서 閭港까지 盛傳하엿스며 又 廣開土王은 每樣 出戰할 時에 軍歌로 使用하야써 軍氣를 振興하니라. 然한대 東明王은 神歌를 解譯하되 左와 如히 하니라.
어아어아 우리 大皇祖 놉흔 恩德. 배달國의 우리들이. 百千萬年 잇지마세. 어아어아 善心은 활이 되고 惡心은 貫射이라. 우리 百千萬人 활줄가티 바른 善心. 활줄가티 一心이라. 어아어아 우리 百千萬人. 한 활장에 無數貫射 穿破하니. 熱湯가튼 善心中에 一點雪이 惡心이리. 어아어아 우리 百千萬人. 활가티 굿센 마음. 배달달國의 光彩로다. 百千萬年 놉흔 恩惠. 우리 大皇祖 우리 大皇祖.＜63＞
＜61-63＞
