To Mr. Gaebyeok
						Sŏngkwŏn

Today, fifty thousand years after the Divine Old Man (神化翁) created heaven and earth, is indeed Old Nature. Just as it is said, "An old sword has no edge, and an old man has no strength," today is a time when the old god has no spiritual power. Therefore, following the corrupt air, a great transformation and great overturning through natural selection and artificial selection—that is, the reconstruction of heaven and earth, the reconstruction of the world, the reconstruction of the spirit, the reconstruction of matter—under the lively dynamic energy of the New Nature, promoting the development of the Hibiscus Isle (槿島) to infinitely open a new heaven, clear a new earth, and give birth to new people, the one who does this is called Gaebyeok (開闢 - Creation). In terms of name and meaning, it is the one that gives birth to heaven and earth; in terms of responsibility, it is the one that awakens the world. Therefore, the single Morning Star in the East that shatters the eternal darkness is Mr. Gaebyeok; the single Celestial Sound in the East that breaks the silence in all directions is Mr. Gaebyeok. Oh, Mr. Gaebyeok, if you wish to create heaven and earth, first create your mind and will; if you wish to create your mind and will, first create morality; if you wish to create morality, first create religion; if you wish to create religion, first create the spirit. Even if waves rise and fall, be majestically self-strengthening like Yu's axe splitting Dragon Gate (龍門); even if winds and clouds come and go, be spiritually perceptive and unclouded like the warm rhinoceros horn illuminating the Whale Islet (鯨渚); first, enable our Korean people (朝鮮的 人類) to help themselves. Self-help (自助) is the savior of the self. Enable them to be free (自在). Freedom is the advisor of the self. Oh, Mr. Gaebyeok, you must first create yourself before you can create people, create society, create the world. Try to think: the sun's rays become the lighthouse of the universe, and the harmony of the spring breeze provides the lively drama for all living things. Even proving by this example, only after having one's own light can one have the power to radiate light to other directions; <73> only after having one's own divine harmony can one have the ability to harmonize with all creation. Therefore, I say that the creation of oneself first is indeed the very first Heavenly Emperor (天皇氏) of the beginning of creation. However, today in the world of thought of our people, the clouds of ancient times from the old heaven have not yet cleared, obscuring their vision; the trees of the Heavenly Emperor from the old earth still stand tall, blocking their view; the wind of Fu Xi (伏羲) from the old people blows in, obstructing their hearing—these are the pre-existing demons, the inherited pitch-dark barrels. To those whose views are extremely coarse and whose hearing is also muddled, administering a divine needle to the crown of their head and ringing a spiritual bell by their ear, striving for the development of Korean culture so that the feet of the swift horse and the nag have no disparity in merit, so that the shanks of the crane and the duck have no disparity in length, uniting and advancing upwards to reconstruct a New Korea (新朝鮮), Mr. Gaebyeok spreads his wings that cover the sky in the Southern Ocean (南溟) and extends his wind-chasing feet on the high roads. I, the reporter, also as a white-headed youth (白頭의 靑年), welcoming the youthful Mr. Gaebyeok today, my mind and spirit are active, and I cannot help but dance with my hands and stomp with my feet. Oh, holy and upright Mr. Gaebyeok, in an upright brain resides a pure spirit. It is the solemn God of Freedom, the brilliant Flower of Civilization. Oh, Mr. Gaebyeok, just as it is said, "Sandalwood is fragrant from a single leaf, and a tiger cub is fierce from birth," your rich, pure fragrance at the very outset is heard far and wide in the mountains and fields, and your blazing heroic spirit tenses society; you are just like the sandalwood fragrant from one leaf and the tiger cub fierce at birth. Alas! If there was Madame Roland's (羅蘭夫人) Mayflower that moved the black slaves, then the youth Gaebyeok, who will bring prosperity to Korea, shall become the June Flower. Today, when the dawn light of international peace shines brilliantly and the world's warning bells vibrate, as long as we are human beings of this world, the responsibility for world reconstruction rests on our shoulders too. Moreover, those who are Koreans should not view themselves merely as Korean Koreans, but recognize themselves as worldly Koreans; not view ourselves merely as Korean selves, but recognize ourselves as worldly selves. Therefore, striving for the Korean Creation (朝鮮的 開闢), with both shoulders bearing equal weight and the heart naturally fervent, Mr. Gaebyeok's teaching pointer is like a spurred swift horse galloping towards a river, and his bell-tongue is like a living Buddha appearing in the world. Therefore, I, the reporter, for the sake of society and the public, to express my welcome and congratulations, send this single phrase to Mr. Gaebyeok: "With the four seas as wine and the universe as a cup, a welcoming toast to Gaebyeok thunders like applause" (四海爲醪 宇宙盃 歡迎開闢祝辭雷).<74>

**Summary**

This article, written by Sŏngkwŏn, is an address welcoming the inaugural issue of the magazine *Gaebyeok* (*Creation*). It personifies the magazine as "Mr. Gaebyeok" and charges it with the monumental task of ushering in a new era for Korea (referred to as 槿島, Hibiscus Isle, and 朝鮮, Chosŏn) and the world. The author emphasizes that true creation or transformation must begin internally—with the spirit, religion, morality, and mind—before extending outwards to society and the world. It calls for self-reliance (自助) and self-determination (自在) among Koreans, urging them to see themselves not just as Koreans but as global citizens participating in world reconstruction. The article uses powerful metaphors of light, sound, nature, and historical/mythical figures to express hope in *Gaebyeok*'s potential to awaken Korean culture and lead the nation towards a revitalized future amidst global change. From a historical perspective, the article powerfully reflects the post-March 1st Movement atmosphere of heightened national consciousness, the desire for modernization and cultural revival under colonial rule, and the influence of progressive, possibly Ch'ŏndogyo-linked, thought emphasizing spiritual and national 'creation' (개벽). Historians might find the emphasis on internal spiritual/moral reform preceding political/social change, the call for both national self-reliance and global awareness, and the specific metaphors used (Divine Old Man, Yu's Axe, Madame Roland) particularly revealing of the intellectual currents among Korean nationalists in 1920.
