Article Title: 詩調 二首 開闢 (Two Sijo Poems: Creation/The Opening)
Author: Author Unknown
Article Type: 시 (Poem)

When Heaven opened and Earth opened (天開地闢), all creation (萬物) also opened.
How could this Opening (開闢) be different? It is the reform (改造) of human affairs (人事).
We wish to open our work and hearts together.

Everyone dislikes the old and says the new is good.
Should we do the disliked old work, embracing the harmonizing new?
From now on, let's do new work, ever newly. <29>

**Summary**

This pair of *sijo* poems, titled "Creation/The Opening" (開闢), serves as a programmatic statement for the magazine "Gaebyeok." The poem connects the concept of cosmic creation (heaven and earth opening) with the necessary reform of human affairs. It calls for embracing the new, discarding the old, and collectively participating in this process of "opening" or renewal in both spirit and action. From a historical perspective, published shortly after the 1919 March 1st Movement, the poem reflects the strong desire for national awakening, societal reform, and cultural enlightenment prevalent among Korean intellectuals under Japanese colonial rule. The use of the term "Gaebyeok" itself, invoking fundamental creation and change, highlights the ambitious goals of the magazine and the era's spirit of seeking a new beginning.

詩調 二首 開闢
天開地闢하니 萬物조차 開闢이라.
開闢이야 別달으랴 人事의 改造ㅣ니라.
우리는 일과 마음 함께 開闢코저.

묵은 것 실혀하고 새 것 조타기는 사람마다
조화하는 새 것 안코 실흔 묵은 일하랴.
이후란 새 일을 새록새록 하리라.＜29＞
