Method for Hundred-Year Longevity
Experimentally Invented by British Medical Doctor Dr. Chŏpsŭchoya

1.  Sleep 8 hours each night.
2.  Sleep lying on the right side of the body.
3.  Be careful of colds and stop opening windows at night.
4.  Do not bathe in the early morning.
5.  Keep bedding as far away from the wall as possible.
6.  Eat small amounts of meat from time to time.
7.  Exercise outdoors once before breakfast.
8.  Do not drink cow's milk after adulthood.
9.  Take tonics/supplements in each of the four seasons every year.
10. Absolutely avoid heavy intoxication.
11. Do not bring animal meat into the room (bedroom).
12. Adopt a rural/farm life as much as possible.
13. Choose your drinking water carefully.
14. Control your desire for fame and achievement.
15. Be open-minded and calm, and do not be anxious or harbor deep anger. <37>

**Summary**

This article presents fifteen rules for achieving a hundred-year lifespan, attributed to a British medical doctor named "Chŏpsŭchoya." The rules cover sleep habits (duration, position, ventilation), hygiene (bathing time), diet (moderate meat, avoiding milk after adulthood, seasonal tonics, water choice), lifestyle (exercise, rural living, avoiding intoxication, keeping meat out of the bedroom), and mental state (controlling ambition, remaining calm, avoiding anxiety and anger). From a historical perspective, the article is interesting as it reflects the early introduction and popularization of Western health concepts in colonial Korea via print media. The specific blend of practical advice (sleep, exercise, moderation) alongside some scientifically questionable or culturally specific recommendations (sleeping position, no milk for adults, no open windows at night, meat in bedroom) highlights the selective interpretation and transmission of Western knowledge during this period, potentially catering to existing Korean sensibilities or misunderstandings.
