Apology Notice (謝告)

In this inaugural issue of Kaebyŏk (本 開闢 創刊號), due to the aversion (忌諱) of the authorities (當局), the phrase "gold rice evil, jade powder" (금쌀악, 옥가루) at the end of the title [section] 'Force Omnipotence-ism' (力萬能主義), the last two lines of the 'Legend of Tan'gun' (檀君神話), the maxim following that in 'Maxims' (막시마쓰), the response to the earnest plea of the subject in 'The Lion' (사―자), the Chinese poem by Ch'ŏng'o-gun (靑吾君), the four lines following "Everyone is spring" (모도가 봄이다) in the novel 'Flowing Sail' (流帆), and the last two lines at the end of the 'Novel Summary' (小說槪要) title resulted in the inaugural issue being subjected to a ban on sale and distribution (發賣頒布의 禁止). Inevitably, after deleting the points of aversion (忌諱點), it came to be published as an extra issue (號外), naturally causing a delay (自然 時日이 遷延이 되엇사오니). Readers (讀者여러분), please forgive (恕諒하여 주옵소서) this situation.

Errata (正誤)

In this extra issue, page 138 (本號外 一三八頁), in the 'Article on the P'yŏngje Pagoda' (平濟塔記事中), Hŭngwangsa (興王寺) should be Wanghŭngsa (王興寺).

**Summary**

This article is an apology notice from the editorial office of Kaebyŏk magazine to its readers. It explains that the inaugural issue faced censorship by "the authorities" (presumably the Japanese Government-General of Korea) due to several specific phrases and passages in different articles and sections. Consequently, the sale and distribution of the original first issue were banned. The magazine had to delete the offending content and release the issue as a delayed "extra issue" (號外). The notice lists the specific items that were censored, ranging from phrases in articles to lines from poetry, mythology, and fiction summaries. It concludes by asking for the readers' understanding regarding the delay and modifications. Historically, this notice is significant as direct evidence of Japanese colonial censorship practices targeting Korean publications in 1920. The detailed list of censored items offers valuable insight into what the colonial authorities considered sensitive or subversive, likely related to Korean nationalism (Tan'gun myth), potentially anti-authoritarian ideas ('Force Omnipotence-ism'), or specific literary expressions.
