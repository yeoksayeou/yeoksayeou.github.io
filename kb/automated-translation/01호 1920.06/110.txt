At sunset on Namsan (黃昏南山), revival's work, urging revival, it cries, "Revive! Revive! (復興復興)".

On the late mountain in the twilight night (晩山暮夜), urging on the work with quick reading (?), it shouts, "Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! (速速速速)".

Frogs that met Kyŏngch'ip (驚蟄맛난 개구리) say they will do that work, crying, "All! All! All! All! (皆皆皆皆)".<37>

**Summary**

This short poem, titled "Jade Powder," uses imagery of nature and time (sunset on Namsan, frogs awakening at Kyŏngch'ip) coupled with repetitive Hanja characters (復興 'revival', 速 'hurry', 皆 'all') to convey a strong sense of urgency and collective action towards an unnamed "사업" (undertaking or work). The poem evokes sounds—the call for revival, the cry to hurry, the croaking of frogs—transforming them into a chorus demanding progress and unity. From the perspective of Korean colonial history, this poem, published in *Kaebyŏk* (often associated with nationalist and socialist ideas) shortly after the 1919 March 1st Movement, is significant. Historians might find its coded language and allegorical style interesting, reflecting how nationalist sentiments and calls for collective effort (likely towards independence or national strengthening) were expressed under Japanese censorship, using nature and repetitive sounds/characters to imply urgency and widespread participation.
