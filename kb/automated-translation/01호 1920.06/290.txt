I, this humble person, heard that *Kaebyŏk* has appeared in the world and cannot contain my joy. Thus, with this poorly constructed quatrain, I briefly express my congratulatory wishes.

The vast divine axe breaks through the primordial chaos (鴻濛),
A great bell (洪鍾) to awaken the world (警世) rings in hand.
Standing and watching, the dawn sun (曙旭) reddens Ch'ŏnggu (靑邱),
The spiritual platform (靈臺) is awake (惺惺), the master (主人翁).

Congratulatory Message

Heaven and Earth open (天地開闢),
Nothing is not born (無物不生). <91>

**Summary**

These two short congratulatory poems celebrate the first issue of the magazine *Kaebyŏk* (Creation or The Opening). The first poem, by Hong Sŏk-hu of Severance Hospital, uses powerful metaphors like a divine axe breaking chaos and a great bell awakening the world, expressing hope that the magazine will bring enlightenment and a new dawn to Korea (referred to poetically as Ch'ŏnggu). The second, shorter poem by O Chi-yŏng links the magazine's title to the fundamental act of creation, implying a new beginning where all things can come into existence. For historians, these poems reflect the intellectual ferment and nationalistic aspirations of early colonial Korea, showcasing the hope placed in cultural and intellectual endeavors like *Kaebyŏk* to "awaken" the nation. The use of classical Chinese poetic forms and allusions alongside modern institutional affiliations (Severance Hospital) is also noteworthy.
