To Those Who Will First Read the Hamgyŏng North Issue (咸北號)

Among the projects of the Kaebyŏk Company (開闢社), the "Basic Survey of Korean Culture," that is, the publication of the "Provincial Issues" (道號), is perhaps not known by the whole world, but it seems most people likely have some idea. The presentation of the cultural survey is not the first time with this issue; since the Provincial Issue is already the fifth one, there must be those among you who have read a Provincial Issue before, and even if you haven't read one, you might have heard about it from someone who has. Thus, there must have been debates about whether it was well done or poorly done. There were likely those who criticized the lack of effort, saying, "Is this also supposed to be a so-called Provincial Issue? There isn't half a p푼eon's worth of substance (씨), only an empty shell (븬껍덱이)." And there were likely also those who said, "Still, it's tolerable. Even that is better than not doing it at all. Can one be full from the first spoonful? Let's wait and see." It seems there may even have been those harsh in their judgment who said, "This must be for the private desire of some travel enthusiast. Saying it's축하 [congratulations] or whatever, they must have done it begging for some money." Indeed, because there is criticism from the other side, the reporter himself, setting aside laments of insufficiency, cannot deny the feeling of superficiality, like 'viewing the mountains from a galloping horse' (走馬看山).

The reporter is already someone who experienced failure in P'yŏngan North Province (平北). Having already experienced failure, I was firmly determined to achieve victory in Hamgyŏng North Province (咸北). However, ultimately, it is again a failure. Inevitably, I find myself treading the same old rut. Why is this so? Because the task itself is inherently difficult (難事) and enormous (大事), my ability is insufficient. What is so difficult and enormous? Is it truly possible to survey the total cultural volume—past, present, and future—of a province possessing at least several hundred square *ri* (百方里), at least several million people (百萬人), and at least several thousand years of history (千年史), within a mere month or so (月餘) and through the observation of just one or two individuals? For any ordinary monthly magazine company, the task itself would likely not be welcomed from the start.

Knowing this, why did we start? Still, we had to do it. It is difficult and enormous, but if we didn't say we must still do it, there would be no one else to do it; if we didn't do it at this time, there would be no other time. Even if we fall down along the way or collapse coming back, even if individual blood runs dry and the Company's (社) strength is exhausted, until that very moment it is exhausted, let us try, with our own hands, to place the culture of our homeland (향토) squarely upon the scale—that is why we began. It seems fitting to say that this alone is admirable and praiseworthy. This is not self-praise or self-conceit; isn't that so? There is no need for lengthy, useless talk. Whether observed well or poorly, just as seen and heard, as far as our footprints (足跡) reached, I will present the Hamgyŏng North Issue through one travelogue (기행) as below, and finally, selecting what can be drawn from that travelogue, I will speak briefly about the general situation of Hamgyŏng North Province and conclude. I especially hope for the understanding (아양) of the people of Hamgyŏng North Province, and let us promise that hereafter, many more achievements of Hamgyŏng North Province will be published in this journal.

**Summary**

This editorial postscript by "Ch'unp'a" serves as an introduction and apology for the Hamgyŏng North Province special issue (咸北號) of the magazine *Kaebyŏk* (開闢). The author acknowledges anticipated criticism regarding the issue's likely superficiality, admitting previous "failure" with the P'yŏngan North Province issue and confessing that this one, too, falls short due to the immense difficulty of comprehensively surveying a province's culture (geography, population, history) with limited time and personnel. Despite these acknowledged shortcomings and the awareness that the task might seem overly ambitious ("viewing the mountains from a galloping horse"), the author defends the continuation of the "Provincial Issue" series as a necessary, albeit flawed, endeavor to document Korea's regional cultures before it's too late, framing it as a patriotic duty undertaken by the Kaebyŏk Company. The piece ends with a plea for understanding from the people of Hamgyŏng North Province and a promise of future, more substantial coverage.

From a historical perspective, this article is revealing about the challenges and motivations of Korean intellectuals and publishers attempting cultural preservation and documentation projects during the colonial period (1924). It highlights the self-awareness of limitations imposed by resources and perhaps implicitly, the political environment, while simultaneously expressing a strong nationalist sentiment driving the effort to survey and value "homeland culture" (향토 문화) despite the difficulties. Historians might find the explicit mention of failure, the justification rooted in necessity ("if we don't do it, who will?"), and the metaphor of placing local culture "squarely upon the scale" of interest in understanding cultural nationalism and publishing practices under constraint.

開闢社의 사업중 朝鮮文化 기본조사라 하면 즉 道號 발간이라하면 세상이 다- 아르신다 하기는 좀 무엇한 듯 하나 그러나 대개는 짐작하실 듯 함니다. 문화조사의 발표가 이번이 처음이 안이고 道號가 발서 다섯번재이니까 저간에는 道號를 읽어 보신 이도 게시겟고 읽지는 못햇다 해도 읽으신 이에게 말슴이라도 들으섯슬 듯 함니다. 그리하야 잘 되얏느니 못되얏느니 시비논란도 잇섯슬 것이외다. 『이것도 소위 道號란 말이냐. 씨라고는 반분어치 들지 안코 븬껍덱이 만이로다』하야 노력이 업슴을 책하는 이도 게섯슬 것이고 『그래도 어지간하다. 그만해도 안이하는 것보다는 낫다. 첫 술에 배부르겟니. 두고 또 보자』하는 이도 게섯슬 것이외다. 시비의 심한 이는 『이것은 엇던 旅行欲者의 私欲거리로구나. 축하니 무어니하고 돈 푼이나 비노라 그리하얏고나』하는 이까지 게섯슬 듯 함니다. 안인게 안이라 對方의 시비가 잇기에 먼저 기자부터 不足之嘆은 그만두고 走馬看山인 허세의 감이 업지 못함니다.
기자는 이미 平北에서 실패를 당한 놈이외다. 이미 실패의 경험이 잇는지라 咸北에서는 기어코 승리를 어드려 단단히 별넛슴니다. 그러나 급기야 또 실패이외다. 할 수 업시 에전박퀴를 다시 밟게 됨니다. 웨그러냐? 원체가 難事요 大事이니까 실력부족이외다. 무엇이 그러케 難事요 大事이냐? 적어도 멧 百方里 적어도 멧 百萬人 적어도 멧 千年史를 가진 그 道의 과거 현재 밋 장래까지의 문화의 총량을 답사하기에 여간 月餘의 시일 여간 1,2개인의 관찰로 감히 되겟슴니까. 여간 월간 잡지사로는 事 자체가 본래-환영치 안이할 것이외다.
그런줄 알면서 웨- 시작을 하얏느냐? 그래도 하야겟슴니다. 難事요 大事이지만 그래도 하야겟다고 안이하면 할 놈이 업겟다고 이 때에 안이하면 다시 때가 업겟다고 가다가 업더지고 오다가 쓸어질지라도 개인의 피가 다-하고 社의 힘이 다-한다 해도 다-하기 그 때까지 우리의 손으로 향토의 문화를 저울 때 복판에 올녀 노아보자-고 그래서 시작한 것이외다. 그만하면 용하고 장하다고 해도 가할 듯 함니다. 自贊自矜이 안이라 그럿치 안슴니까. 쓸대업는 말을 길게 할 필요는 업슴니다. 잘 보앗건 못 보앗건 본대로 드른대로 足跡이 밋친데 까지 그대로 알에와 가티 기행 1편으로써 咸北號를 대하고 최후에 그 기행에서 뽑을 것을 뽑아서 咸北의 대개를 간단히 말하고 말겟슴니다. 특히 咸北人士의 아양을 바라오며 딸하 뒤로 더-만흔 咸北의 실적이 본지에 실리게 되기를 약조해 둡시다.
