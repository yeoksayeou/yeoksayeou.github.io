A Miscellany of Interest: A Four-Sided View of the Mouse
						By 靑吾 (Ch'ŏng'o)

The Mouse Viewed from Zoology
The mouse is a type of vertebrate animal, belonging to the Rodentia order among mammals. Its nature is timid (㥘懦), its senses are extremely keen, and its movements are agile (敏捷). It has two pairs of incisors (門齒) in the upper and lower jaws that grow continuously. The inner side is relatively soft and wears down (磨滅) each time it bites (嚙合), but the outer side is the opposite, being hard (硬質). Therefore, like a sharpened awl (*), it is sharply pointed (銳尖) and suitable for chewing (咀嚼) grains, fruits, wood, etc. Consequently, if one of the mouse's upper or lower incisors is removed (拔去) and it is raised, the opposing incisor loses its chewing action (嚼囓作用) and does not wear down, eventually growing to the point where it pierces (破裂) the flesh of the opposite jaw (顎肉). The reason mice constantly chew on things is less about filling a hungry stomach (飢膓) and more about regulating the growth of their incisors. Its whiskers (鬚) are long (their length generally equaling the width of the head) and substitute for the sense of touch, allowing it to recognize the size of holes (穴). From this perspective, the mouse's whiskers are like humanity's measuring instruments. Each limb (肢) has five toes (趾); although small, they are very sharp (銳) and adapted for climbing (攀上) and digging (*穴). The forelimbs are short, but the hindlimbs are long, and its long tail also provides convenience when climbing. Its fur color is the so-called mouse color (鼠色), making it convenient for hiding in dark places; this is animal camouflage (保護色). Mice have a tendency towards cannibalism (同族相食), and suffer much harm from external enemies (外敵) (like cats, etc.), but their reproductive power is immense (甚多) (they mature in 3 months and produce several litters of 3-4 young per year, 數3匹 [meaning unclear, perhaps average 3?]), spreading throughout the world (褄息), making them very difficult to exterminate (驅除). Also, because mice have a voracious appetite (貪食性), they chew on plants, clothing, tools, and other general goods, and are animals easily susceptible (羅하기 易한) to the Black Death (黑死病), thus posing a risk (虞) of transmitting (傳播) its bacteria (其菌) to humans. In summary (總而言하면), the mouse is a harmful and useless animal to humanity.

The Mouse Viewed from Korean Superstition (迷信)

**Summary**

This article by "Ch'ŏng'o" presents a multifaceted view of the mouse from four perspectives: modern zoology, Korean linguistics (proverbs and vocabulary), Korean folk superstitions, and classical Chinese literature/history. The zoological section describes the mouse's biology and behavior, concluding it's harmful. The linguistic part lists numerous Korean idioms, sayings, and terms related to mice, reflecting their pervasive presence in daily life and language. The superstition section details various folk beliefs about mice as omens or ingredients in folk remedies. The final, longest section compiles a wide array of references to mice (鼠) from classical Chinese texts (philosophy, history, literature, dictionaries), showcasing their symbolic significance and presence in East Asian high culture.

From a colonial history perspective, the article is interesting as it juxtaposes modern Western scientific classification (Zoology) with traditional Korean linguistic expressions, superstitions, and classical East Asian knowledge (漢學). This reflects the intellectual environment of the 1920s, where Koreans were navigating the influx of Western thought alongside their own cultural heritage and the still-influential Sinic tradition. The detailed listing of Korean proverbs and superstitions documents aspects of folk culture, while the extensive compilation from Chinese classics demonstrates the enduring relevance of Hanja scholarship for intellectuals of the time. The somewhat negative framing in the zoological section might also reflect modern hygiene discourses gaining prominence.

趣味雜語 쥐의 四面觀
						靑吾
動物學上으로 觀한 쥐
쥐는 脊椎動物의 일종이니 哺乳類중 齧齒類에 속하얏다. 성질이 㥘懦하고 감각이 심히 예민하야 동작이 敏捷하다. 門齒는 上下에 2對가 有하야 不絶히 성장하는데 其內側은 비교적 연약하야 嚙合할 시마다 磨滅되나 外側은 此와 반대로 硬質인 故로 *(송곳)을 硏한 것과 가티 銳尖하야 곡물, 과실, 목재등을 咀嚼하기에 적당하다. 그럼으로 쥐의 上下 門齒중 其一을 拔去하고 飼養하면 此에 대한 門齒는 嚼囓作用을 失하야 磨滅되지 안이함으로 遂히 성장하야 其相對의 顎肉을 破裂함에 至한다. 쥐가 항상 물건을 嚼囓하는 것은 飢膓을 充하랴는 것보다도 門齒의 성장을 조절하랴는 것이다. 鬚는 長하야 (其長이 대개 頭幅과 同함) 촉각을 代用하고 此로써 穴의 大小를 인식한다. 此点으로 見하면 鼠의 鬚는 인류의 측량기구와 갓다. 各肢에는 五趾가 有하니 비록 小하나 심히 銳하야 攀上와 *穴에 적응하고 前肢는 短하되 後肢는 長하며 且尾가 長하야 攀上할 際에 편익을 與한다. 毛色은 소위 鼠色을 呈하야 암처에서 은신하기에 편리하니 此卽動物의 보호색이다. 쥐는 同族相食의 性이 有하고 外敵(如猫太等)의 피해가 多하나 번식력이 甚多하야 (3개월에 성장하야 年3,4回式 數3匹의 子를 생산함) 전세계의 褄息함으로 驅除키 甚難하다. 또 쥐는 貪食性이 有함으로 식물, 의복, 기구, 기타 일반 물품을 咀囓하고 黑死病에 羅하기 易한 동물인 故로 인류에게 其菌을 傳播는 虞가 有하다. 總而言하면 쥐는 인류에게 有害無益한 동물이다.
