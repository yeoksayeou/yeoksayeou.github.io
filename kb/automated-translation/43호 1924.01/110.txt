The Tumen River flows southeast from Paektu Mountain, thereby defining the boundary between north and south. Reaching east of Hunyung Fortress in Kyŏngwŏn Prefecture, it passes through a gorge opening and frequently floods, causing trouble. It breaches our western boundary, forming an island several *li* square, which the local people call Ido (珥島). In the *kabin* year of Kangxi (1674), Prefectural Magistrate Yi Yu (李秞) blocked the branch stream, fixed the waterway, and erected three stone markers at the upper, middle, and lower parts of the island.

In recent years, officials from Jilin have been recruiting people from Hunchun to cultivate the wasteland. People from Hunchun, seeing this land was arable, reported it to their officials and requested permission to cultivate it. They then referred to it as P'yŏnt'ong (片爾通), claimed our people's cultivation was illegal occupation (佔墾), and intended to annex the land. Our people strongly resisted, but the official case remained unresolved.

In the *kyemi* year (1883), I, while serving as Northwest Circuit Inspector (經畧西北), visited Kyŏngwŏn to discuss trade inspection matters. Assistant Director P'eng Kuang-yü (彭光譽) arrived from Jilin to confer on commercial affairs. Under instructions from Minister O Ta-ch'eng (吳大澂) of Ningguta, [he] conducted an on-site survey nearby. Initially swayed by the Hunchun people's arguments, the waterway issue lost its substance. I dealt with it through official documents. [We] then crossed the river again, inspected the monument sites, searched for evidence, and presented the matter clearly to the higher authorities, thereby correcting the situation.

For adjacent countries using a river as a boundary, the navigable channel is established as the demarcation line. The Hunchun people's desire to cross the river and encroach is utterly baseless. If not for Prefect Yi's erection of the stone markers and Assistant Director P'eng's impartial inspection, it nearly became a dispute like that of Yu and Rui (虞芮之爭). The middle marker was washed away by water, and the lower marker was destroyed by the Hunchun people. Therefore, I ordered craftsmen to cut stone, carve the inscription of the previous marker onto its face, briefly record the details of the discussions and inspection, and secure it firmly. All future guardians of this land should cultivate together and protect it.

Erected on a day in the seventh month of the *kyemi* year, the ninth year of Guangxu (1883).
Recorded by O Yun-jung (魚允中). <85>

**Summary**

This text is the inscription from a boundary marker re-erected in 1883 by O Yun-jung, a Joseon official. It details a border dispute concerning an island called Ido in the Tumen River, formed by the river changing course near Kyŏngwŏn. It recounts how earlier markers were placed in 1674 by Yi Yu, how people from Hunchun (Qing China) later attempted to claim the island for cultivation, calling it P'yŏnt'ong, and how O Yun-jung, along with Qing officials P'eng Kuang-yü and under the auspices of O Ta-ch'eng, investigated and reaffirmed the boundary based on the main river channel and historical markers, despite some being lost or destroyed. For historians, this inscription provides direct insight into late 19th-century Joseon-Qing border management, the specific diplomatic processes involved in resolving disputes (joint inspection, appeal to higher authorities), and the significance of physical markers and geographical features (like the main river channel) in defining the Tumen River boundary, a recurring theme in later Korean-Chinese relations, particularly concerning the Gando/Jiandao region.
