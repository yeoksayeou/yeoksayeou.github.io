豫告 (Announcement)

The upcoming February issue of "Kaebyŏk" (開闢) will be published as a New Year Literary Supplement Issue.

To infuse new energy into the Chosŏn literary world in the new year, and to inform the masses everywhere, who are just now beginning to stir, about what exactly the role of art is, we have specially, specially established this plan.

From the Editorial Department <239>

**Summary**

This is an announcement from the editorial department of the magazine "Kaebyŏk" (開闢) stating that the February 1924 issue will be a special New Year Literary Supplement. The goal is to revitalize the Korean literary scene and educate the "stirring masses" about the social role and importance of art. For historians, this text highlights the active effort within colonial Korea to use literature and art as tools for national consciousness-raising and cultural development, framing art not just aesthetically but as having a specific "role" (소임) for the "masses" (민즁) during a period of nascent social and political awakening under Japanese rule. The mention of "stirring masses" hints at growing social awareness or unrest.
