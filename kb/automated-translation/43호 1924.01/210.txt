A Word of Pukkwan Dialect

Question: Auntie, do you have any *pijitkae*?
Answer: Yes, I do!
Request: Give me one box. And give me the *sungch'ŏn*.
Response: Here you go. The *sungch'ŏn* is ten *chŏn*.

“Pijitkae” (비짓개) is “matches” (성냥) in Seoul dialect, written as “唐璜” in Hanja, and is a loanword from Russian (露語). “Sungch'ŏn” (숭쳔) is “change/balance money” (거스름돈) in Seoul dialect, and comes from the Chinese word Shengqian (勝錢).<187>

**Summary**

This short piece presents a brief dialogue in the Pukkwan (Hamgyŏng Province) dialect, illustrating the use of the words "pijitkae" (matches) and "sungch'ŏn" (change money). It then explains that "pijitkae" is derived from Russian and "sungch'ŏn" from Chinese, contrasting them with the standard Seoul equivalents. The article provides a glimpse into regional dialect variations and linguistic borrowing in early 20th-century Korea. For historians, it documents specific dialectal terms and highlights the cultural and linguistic influence of neighboring Russia and China on the northern regions of Korea during the colonial period.
