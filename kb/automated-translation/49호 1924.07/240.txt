Number of Seizures of Newspapers and Magazines in the Capital
The above figures are limited to the period from Taishō 11 (1922) to May of Taishō 13 (1924); besides these, the suppression incidents (筆禍事件) involving *Sinsaenghwal* and *Sinch'ŏnji* still remain in the public's memory (世人).

**Summary**

This short piece notes the period (1922 to May 1924) for which seizure counts of Seoul-based newspapers and magazines were compiled (though the counts themselves aren't given here). It explicitly mentions the well-remembered suppression incidents involving the magazines *Sinsaenghwal* and *Sinch'ŏnji* as additional examples beyond the statistics. The article serves as a brief reference to the ongoing censorship and suppression faced by the Korean press under Japanese colonial rule. Historians might find it useful as contemporary evidence acknowledging the climate of censorship and specifically naming publications known to have faced suppression (筆禍事件).
