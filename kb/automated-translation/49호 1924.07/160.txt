A Review of the First Section, Eastern Painting, at the Third Chōsen Art Exhibition
						Anonymous

Hearing that the 3rd Chōsen Art Exhibition (朝鮮美術展覽會) would open from June 1st, I, despite having no cultivation or insight into what art, calligraphy, or painting might be, went up to Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul) before the exhibition period out of sheer curiosity, as is my annual custom. Right at the opening, I first took a general look. Truly, how could a blind man viewing colorful paintings discern superiority or inferiority? Among them, the second and third sections are even more beyond my ability to comment on. However, regarding the first section, the reason I dare to offer meaningless and irrelevant wild criticism is because my interest lies somewhat in this first section.

Regarding Hŏ Paengnyŏn's (許百鍊君) "Kyêsan Ch’ŏngch'wi" (溪山淸趣 - Clear Charm of溪 Mountain and Stream), perhaps because it lacks an award plaque this year, compared to his 2nd or 3rd place works of previous years, forget progress, it actually diminishes the color of the entire hall's splendor. His former fame is regrettable. Ch'oe Usŏk's (崔禹錫君) "Spring at Ch'anggyŏngwŏn" (春의 昌慶苑) uses a technique neither new nor old, applying color to a woodblock rubbing (木刻 榻本). Perhaps due to the considerable effort expended, it seems to have been selected. No Suhyŏn's (盧壽鉉君) "Sanch'on Kwimok" (山村歸牧 - Returning Herd in a Mountain Village) shows much painstaking effort, but there are many deviations from rules in arrangement and dotting. Yi Sangbŏm's (李象範君) "Ch'usan Soso" (秋山蕭寺 - Desolate Temple in Autumn Mountains) has vigorous brushwork, but the composition lacks interest. "Moa Hanyŏn" (暮鴉寒煙 - Evening Crows, Cold Smoke) does not deviate from the theme's intention, but there is little liveliness in the ink marks. Looking at the arrangement and brush movement in Yi Yongu's (李用雨君) "Hasan" (夏山 - Summer Mountain), it is as if seeing the artist himself; his talent surpasses others, but his foundational training is shallow. His arbitrary wandering – how will this affect his future progress? Yi Hanbok's (李漢福君) "Thistle" (薊) took the top prize. Its wondrous brushwork and brilliance are certainly eye-catching, the pearl among all selections. However, he submitted "Thistle" for the 1st Art Exhibition, "Thistle" again for the 4th Calligraphy and Painting Association (書畵協會) exhibition this spring, and now "Thistle" again for this 3rd Exhibition. I have heard the old tale of some village scholar who only wrote "Kangnam P'ungwŏl Han Tanyŏn" (江南風月閑多年 - Jiangnan Wind and Moon, Idle for Many Years), becoming an unparalleled master of those seven characters but unable to form a single other character. Yet, there cannot be a reason for him to have specialized solely in this one type, "Thistle," like this. Why the same "Thistle" year after year, time after time? What is the intention, the taste? Will he be able to submit paintings of other subjects from now on? Kim Yongsu's (金龍洙) "Wŏlya" (月夜 - Moonlit Night) could be said to have regressed compared to last year. Kim Ŭnho's (金殷鎬君) "Puhwal hu" (부활 후 - After Resurrection) has refined brushwork, but this is not his own design; it is an enlargement of a Western photograph (西洋의 寫眞畵), a painting neither Eastern nor Western, hardly worth praising. Why the 3rd prize? Pyŏn Kwansik's (卞寬植君) "Ch'u" (秋 - Autumn), among the various landscapes displayed <74>, has its merits, but the excessive roughness in brushwork is a flaw.

The works by Japanese individuals are numerous, making it difficult to list them all. However, to generalize based on the award winners: Mikado's (三戶君) "Yakusu" (藥水 - Medicinal Water), although the woman's figure and clothing seem unfamiliar, the background and colors merit the 2nd prize. Ōki's (大木君) "Pulkwang Pojo" (佛光普照 - Buddha's Light Shining Everywhere) has a majestic feeling that manifests itself beyond the brushwork, unique in the entire exhibition, yet receiving only the 3rd prize is somewhat regrettable. Fukuda's (福田君) "Shunkō Shūi" (春光秋意 - Spring Light, Autumn Sentiment) shows exquisite brushwork, and Adachi Hideko's (足立秀子) "Sōshun" (早春 - Early Spring) expresses profound contemplation, deserving endless admiration. Uno's (宇野君) "Seishō Reimu" (靜宵靈夢 - Quiet Night, Spiritual Dream) naturally evokes a sense of幽 the ethereal. Katayama's (堅山君) "Seibutsu" (靜物 - Still Life) feels like facing a greengrocer's stall (八百屋). Tokue's (禿惠君) "Mokutan" (牧丹 - Peony) seems to melt tenderly in the spring breeze. Besides these, all the other pieces seem to be ones where none would yield the top spot to us [Koreans]. That the scores and results show that we, the numerous people of all Chōsen, cannot compete against the few resident Japanese – how can we not feel ashamed and indignant?

Why is this so? It is because Japan has nurturing institutions, starting with the Tōkyō Bijutsu Gakkō (東京美術學校), scattered throughout the country, where encouragement and research converge. The so-called Chōsen Art Exhibition, while ostensibly promoting and developing art with Koreans as the focus under the banner of cultural administration (文化政治), does not even dream of methods for guidance or institutions for nurturing. If they merely hold an exhibition year after year, how can we, who have neither been taught nor have studied, compete against the Japanese who have practiced sufficiently? Thus, it is a clear fact that the Japanese results will advance year by year, while our works will repeatedly regress. Where lies the fundamental purpose of promoting art for the sake of Koreans? I have neither the right nor the qualification to censure the authorities' actions, but unable to suppress the emotions filling my heart, I end with this one word. <75>

**Summary**

The anonymous author reviews the Eastern Painting section of the 3rd Chōsen Art Exhibition in 1924. While acknowledging their lack of expertise, the author critiques several Korean artists, noting perceived stagnation (Hŏ Paengnyŏn), unusual techniques (Ch'oe Usŏk), technical flaws (No Suhyŏn, Yi Sangbŏm, Pyŏn Kwansik), promising but underdeveloped talent (Yi Yongu), repetitive subject matter despite skill (Yi Hanbok), regression (Kim Yongsu), and questionable awarding for derivative work (Kim Ŭnho). The author contrasts this with the perceived higher quality and award success of Japanese artists, attributing the disparity to Japan's established art education system (like the Tōkyō Bijutsu Gakkō) versus the lack of such institutions and guidance for Koreans under the colonial government's "cultural administration," despite the exhibition ostensibly being for Koreans. The author laments the likely continued decline of Korean artists' performance relative to Japanese artists under these conditions.

For historians, this article is revealing of the colonial cultural landscape. It showcases Korean artistic activity and critique during the period but highlights the deep sense of frustration and perceived inequality felt by Koreans regarding the opportunities and support provided by the Japanese colonial government's "cultural policy." The comparison between Korean and Japanese artists' training and performance, and the author's explicit critique of the lack of Korean art education infrastructure despite the exhibition's stated purpose, underscores the limitations and potential hypocrisy of colonial cultural initiatives. The specific critiques of individual artists also offer insight into contemporary aesthetic judgments and the developing styles of prominent early modern Korean painters.

第三回 朝鮮美術展覽會의 第一部 東洋畵를 보고서
						無名
제3회 朝鮮美術展覽會가 6월 1일부터 개최된다기에 予는 미술이 무엇인지 書畵가 무엇인지 素養도 識見도 다- 업건마는 공연한 호기심으로 年例와 如히 會期 전에 上京하야 開場劈頭에 爲先 縱覽하니 可謂 盲者의 丹靑觀이 何優 何劣을 엇지 변별하리오. 그 중에 제2부, 제3부는 더군다나 言論不能이고 但히 제1부에 대하야는 無意味 無關係한 妄評을 敢發코저 함은 予의 旨趣가 제1부에는 略存한 까닭이다.
許百鍊君의 溪山淸趣는 금년엔 入賞札이 업서 그래 보이는지 年來 2, 3등에 비하면 진보는 고사하고 滿場의 錦繡를 此로 인하야 색채를 減케 됨은 前日 명성이 可惜이고 崔禹錫君의 春의 昌慶苑은 木刻 榻本에 着色한 非新非舊의 筆法이나 하여간 정력을 多費한 덕으론지 入選된 모양이고 盧壽鉉君의 山村歸牧은 辛苦는 퍽 햇스나 排布點綴에 乖規가 多하고 李象範君의 秋山蕭寺는 筆力은 健率하되 結構가 無味하며 暮鴉寒煙은 題意와는 無違하나 墨痕의 생동이 少無하고 李用雨君의 夏山은 排布와 運筆을 본즉 筆者를 如見이라 才氣는 過人이나 夙工이 淺薄한데 任意放浪함은 將進에 엇덜는지 李漢福君의 薊는 頭賞을 占한 者라 奇筆精彩가 令人奪目함은 물론 全選中 鮫綃로되 君은 제1회 美展에도 薊고 今春 書畵協會 제4회 展에도 薊고 금번 此 제3회 展에도 또 薊니 엇던 村學究가 江南風月閑多年만 書하야 此 7개字는 無上名筆이고 他書는 一字를 不成이드란 古談은 聞하얏스나 此와 如히 薊 一種만 專學하얏슬 理는 無한데 年年 番番히 똑 薊뿐만은 何意思 何趣味인가. 此後부터는 혹 他種의 畵를 出品할 수가 잇슬는지 金龍洙의 月夜는 작년보다 도리혀 퇴보라 하겟고 金殷鎬군의 부활 후는 筆態는 精細하나 此는 자기의 意匠이 아니라 西洋의 寫眞畵를 확대한 非東非西의 畵가 족히 讚道할 배 無한데 3등상은 웬일이고 卞寬植君의 秋는 진열한＜74＞ 諸 山水 중에는 優点이 有하나 用筆에 荒率이 過露함이 欠節이다.
日本人의 작품은 원래 多數하야 일일히 枚擧키 難하나 入賞者로만 槪論하면 三戶君의 藥水는 여자의 형체와 의복은 生踈한 듯하나 배경과 색채가 2등의 가치가 有하고 大木君의 佛光普照는 장엄한 기분이 筆外에 自現함은 一場의 獨特인데 겨우 3등에 賞됨은 족음 유감이라 하겟고 福田君의 春光秋意의 정묘한 筆致와 足立秀子의 早春은 深遠한 凝想이 표현됨은 歎賞을 不己고 宇野君의 靜宵靈夢은 幽渺한 의지가 自生하고 堅山君의 靜物은 八百屋에 臨한 듯 禿惠君의 牧丹은 春風에 무루녹은 듯하고 此外 諸点도 擧皆 吾人에게 讓頭할 者이 업는 것 가트니 점수와 성적이 全朝鮮 多數의 吾人으로 少數 寄居하는 日本人을 對敵지 못한다 함은 엇지 愧赧하고 분개치 아느리오.
此는 何故냐 하면 日本은 배양하는 기관이 東京美術學校를 비롯하야 전국에 산재하야 장려와 연구가 합치한 所以라. 所謂 朝鮮美術展覽會는 당국이 문화정치 표방 하에 朝鮮人을 본위로 미술을 장려 발전케 한다면서 敎導의 방법과 배양의 기관은 夢想도 아니하고 한갓 年年히 展覽會만 개최하면 敎함도 업고 學함도 업는 吾人이 엇지 충분히 연습한 日人을 당하리오. 然則 日人의 성적은 年年히 진취되고 吾人의 작품은 每每히 退敗할 것은 분명한 사실이라. 朝鮮人을 위하야 미술을 장려한다는 本旨가 何에 在하뇨. 予는 당국의 行事를 論責할 권리나 자격도 업지만 滿腔의 감회를 不禁하야 一言으로써 끗는다.＜75＞
