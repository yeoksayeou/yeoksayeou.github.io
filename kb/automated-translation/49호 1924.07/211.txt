An Announcement

Issue No. 49 of this magazine, scheduled for publication on July 1st, was subjected to a sales ban due to incurring the displeasure (忌諱) of the authorities. Therefore, we are publishing and distributing a special temporary issue instead.

Kaebyŏk Company <99>

**Summary**

This is a notice from the Kaebyŏk Company announcing that the July 1st, 1924 issue (No. 49) of their magazine *Kaebyŏk* has been banned from sale by the authorities. As a result, they are issuing a temporary replacement issue. This brief announcement is historically significant as it directly documents the censorship practices of the Japanese colonial government against Korean publications, highlighting the suppression of expression during that period. Historians would find it useful as primary evidence of the operational challenges and political pressures faced by Korean publishers under colonial rule.
