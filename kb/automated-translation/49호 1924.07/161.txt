**Summary**

This is a company announcement from Kaebyŏk Magazine informing readers of the establishment of a new branch office in Ch'osan. The announcement provides the location, the geographical area covered (Ch'osan, Wiwŏn, Pyŏktong), and the names of the key staff members assigned to the branch, including the manager, a reporter, and advisors. It instructs readers in those areas to direct all future correspondence, subscriptions, and advertising requests to the new branch.

For historians, this announcement illustrates the organizational expansion and logistical efforts of a major Korean cultural magazine during the colonial period. Establishing a branch in Ch'osan, a town in North P'yŏngan province near the Yalu River border with China, demonstrates *Kaebyŏk*'s attempt to reach readers in relatively remote northern regions, highlighting the magazine's reach and distribution network development in the 1920s.
