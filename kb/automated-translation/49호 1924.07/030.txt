我們的 使命
						蔣夢麟
Dr. Jiang Menglin (蔣夢麟) is currently the Acting Chancellor of Peking University (北京大學), the foremost figure in the entire Chinese academic world, and an influential leader in the construction of the new China, as we have long known. That the esteemed teacher specially took up his pen for this fourth-anniversary commemorative issue of *Kaebyŏk* will surely be something our readers deeply appreciate, perhaps unexpectedly. Although the text is short, its profound meaning will become clear upon reading. "What is our mission? Let us pass through hardship and difficulty and fulfill our mission. Let's go, quickly, among the masses, to build a new society of compassion (同情) and mutual aid (互助)." This is the meaningful message given to our readers. - Yi Tong-gok (李東谷), Addendum -

Hobbes (霍布士) once said, "When men are caught up in erroneous opinions and have deeply imprinted these opinions in their hearts, speaking clearly to such people is more impossible than writing clearly on a paper that has already been scribbled upon." If his words are correct, then our future is even more bleak. So much superstition (迷信) and prejudice (偏見) come from the milk of our mothers or wet nurses, from the talk and laughter of our grandfathers or grandmothers, or from our teachers and companions in childhood. It is for this reason that we are ridiculed (奚落) and mocked (譏笑). But what shall we do? Shall we, like the Cossacks (哥薩克人), whip ourselves with leather whips (皮鞭子)? Shall we, like people of other countries, numb (麻醉) ourselves with champagne? Or shall we, like beasts on the battlefield, devour (呑嚙) others? If so, then our future holds only slaughter (殘殺) and intoxication (沉醉).

It is not only the poison of convention (因襲) planted within us. If you are willing to look or listen, you will see or hear an unavoidable calamity right before us. Perhaps our children and grandchildren will suffer even more than we do now. But understand this: if you do not create further causes for suffering (孽因), naturally those who come later will not face an even more tragic outcome. Moreover, if we can strive hard, we can reduce some of the present and future troubles and pains. The importance of the era we live in and the responsibility we bear can thus be clearly seen here. Jiang Menglin. Darwin (達爾文) said the struggle for existence (生存競爭) results in the survival of the fittest (優勝劣敗), the weak becoming prey to the strong (弱肉强食). But Kropotkin (克魯泡特金)＜12＞ clearly tells us: "If there were no justice (正義), no compassion (同情), and no mutual aid (互助), humanity would surely perish, just like certain animals that live by plunder (搶掠) or ants (螞蟻) that keep slaves perish." We should remember this firmly. Not only us, but even our enemies should understand this.

If you have already received higher education, do not think it is for you to attain enjoyment or to get a position in the government (政府). Do not roam freely (逍遙) in the cities or pray in churches. Our predecessors have already told us, and this call has also achieved remarkable results: "Go among the people" (Vnarod) to help our pitiable friends. Forget all vanity (虛榮) and enjoyment. Do not fear having no school building when teaching, no instruments or medicine when treating illness, or no reliable salary (薪俸) and reward (報酬). You must know that our ancestors and brothers died because they could not get education, could not get medical treatment, or sons were abused by fathers, wives were insulted (凌辱) by husbands. Their graves are remembered by no one; their suffering is mourned by no one. Yet they are still dreaming there, and they are about to die just like that. It is not only external forces that oppress us; the suffering we personally endure now is minor. If you think—if you think of waking the sleeping giant or converting enemies, do not rely on the bombs (炸彈) and handguns (手槍) in your hands. You have your quiet voice, your amiable (和靄) countenance, your persevering (堅忍) will, and your gentle kiss. These are your weapons. Undoubtedly, we should guide the masses toward freedom and light, fight against all dangers and despotism (專制), and when sacrifice (犧牲) is necessary, sacrifice ourselves first. However, do not force others to sacrifice for your sake. We should and must remember with our firm memory the words, "Without compassion (同情) and mutual aid (互助), humanity 'will surely perish...'" At the same time, we must first strive to improve ourselves. Even if we cannot support humanity and society, let future generations sympathize with us, pity us; at least let them not curse (咀呪) us or spit saliva (唾沫) on our tombstones.

Perhaps my words are incomplete, but if we can truly act like this, I think we can complete at least a part of our mission (使命).＜13＞

**Summary**

Jiang Menglin, then Acting Chancellor of Peking University, urges educated individuals to recognize their mission: to reject self-interest, inherited prejudices, and violence, and instead go among the common people ("Vnarod"). He emphasizes Kropotkin's idea that compassion and mutual aid, not just Darwinian struggle, are essential for human survival. The educated should use gentle persuasion and self-sacrifice, not force, to guide the masses toward freedom and light, working to alleviate suffering and improve society, thereby fulfilling their responsibility and avoiding the condemnation of future generations. For Korean colonial history, this article is significant as it reflects the pan-Asian intellectual discourse on national salvation and the role of elites in the 1920s. The call to "go among the people," originating from Russian populism, resonated strongly with Korean intellectuals grappling with colonial oppression and searching for ways to enlighten and mobilize the masses, mirroring similar movements in Korea like the *Vnarod* movement (브나로드 운동) that gained momentum slightly later. Jiang's emphasis on mutual aid and non-violent methods also provides a contrast or complement to more radical approaches considered at the time.

我們的 使命
						蔣夢麟
蔣夢麟 박사는 現 北京大學의 代理校長으로 全 中國學界의 第一人이며 新中國 건설의 유력한 지도자임은 우리의 일즉이 아는 바이라. 금번 開闢 4주년 기념호에 선생이 特이 이 붓을 잡아 주게 된 것은 독자의 意外의 감사하게 생각하는 바일 것이외다. 글은 비록 짜르나 그 의미의 深長한 것은 보아서 아시련니와 「우리의 사명은 무엇이냐? 괴롭고 어려움 지나여 우리의 사명을 다하자. 가자, 어서 민중의 사이로, 同情과 互助의 新社會의 건설로」 이것이 우리 독자에게 뜻잇게 준 것이외다.    -李東谷 付識-

霍布士(Hobbes) 曾說 『人旣陷於誤謬的意見之中 並把這些意見深印在心中的時候 我們要對這種人明明白白的說話 比在一張寫濫了的紙上要淸淸楚楚的寫字更不可能』 他的話要是不錯的 我們的前途就更凄凉了 多少的迷信和偏見 從我們母親或乳母的乳裏 祖父或祖母的談笑裏 或者在幼年時代從我們的先生和同伴裏得來. 我們的被人奚落 被人譏笑也就爲了這個. 可是我們將怎樣呢. 我們要和哥薩克人一樣拿皮鞭子來打我們自己 和別國人一樣拿香檳酒來麻醉自己 或者竟如沙場上的野獸一樣來呑嚙別人 那末 我們的將來也只有殘殺和沉醉了.
也不僅是因襲的毒害種在我們的身上 只要儞肯去看或者去聽 你就要看到或者聽到一種不能避免的災禍就在我們目前 也許我們的子孫要比現在我們所受的苦還大 但是要明白 假設儞不去再造孽因 自然後來的也不至於受到更悲慘的結果 幷且我們苟能努力 也就能减去点 現在和將來的煩擾與苦痛 我們所處的時代和所負的責任之重要 也就能在這裏很顯然的看出. 蔣夢麟達爾文說生存競爭是優勝劣敗 弱肉强食 但是克魯泡特金(Kropot Kim)＜12＞明明白白的告我們道『倘使沒有正義 沒有同情和互助 人類一定會滅亡 好像有幾種依搶掠爲生的動物 及養畜奴隷的螞蟻一樣的滅亡』 這個我們應當確切的記着 不但我們 就是我們的仇敵也該理會這個.
要是儞已經受邊高等敎育就不要以爲這是使儞來得到享樂的 或者是可以在政府裏來我個位置的 儞不要在都市裏去逍遙 敎堂中去祈禱 我們的前輩已經告訴我們 而且這種呼聲也會奏邊奇效 這就是『到民間去』(Vnarod)爲去幇助我們那些可憐的朋友 且把一切的虛榮和享樂忘掉 不要怕敎人時沒有校舍 治病時沒有器具和葯物 或者沒有可靠的薪俸和報酬 儞要曉得我們的祖先和兄弟 因爲得不着敎育 得不着醫葯 或者做兒子的受父親的虐待 做妻的受丈夫的凌辱 而這樣的死了 他們的坆墓是沒有人記得的 他們的苦楚是沒有人悲傷的 可是他們還在那裏做夢 幷且他們就要這樣的死了 來壓迫我們的不只是外力 現在我們所身受的苦痛是微小的 如果儞想-儞想去驚醒睡漢 或者感化仇人 不要靠儞手裏的炸彈和手槍 儞有儞幽靜的聲音 和靄的面貌. 堅忍的意志和溫柔的接吻 這些都是儞的武器 無疑的我們應當引導民衆到自由和光明裏去 可以和一切的危險和專制奮鬪 到必需犧牲時 先犧牲自己 然而不要爲了儞强迫的使人家來犧牲. 應該幷且必需的拿我們堅確的記憶來記住 『沒有同情和互助 人類「一定會滅亡...」的話一面也當先盡力的來改善我們自己 卽使我們不能扶助人類和社會 也當讓後世的人來同情我們 可憐我們 至少也不要讓後人來咀呪我們 或者把唾沫吐在我們的墓碑上.
我的話或者有不盡的地方 但是眞能如此 我想我們的使命總可完成了一部分.＜13＞
