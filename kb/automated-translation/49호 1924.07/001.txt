Precautions

一 Magazine fees and postage must all be paid in advance. If the advance payment runs out, dispatch will be stopped.
However, if a shortfall in the advance payment arises due to special enlarged issues or other fixed prices, dispatch will await further payment.

一 Please be sure to utilize the postal transfer account number.

一 Substituting postage stamps for payment is absolutely refused.
However, limited to areas with inconvenient transportation only, substitution is specially permitted with a ten percent surcharge.

一 Cash on delivery and parcel handling are absolutely refused.
However, when requesting a sample copy, the fixed price plus shipping costs must be paid in advance.

一 When consolidating payments for Kaebyŏk, Sin Yŏsŏng (New Woman), Ŏrini (Children), and other publications, please itemize each type and its amount in the communication section on the back of the postal transfer form.

一 For requesting a receipt, the return postage fee is required; for requesting a refund of payment, the return shipping fee must be requested.

一 When changing your address, you must notify the Head Office (本社), clearly stating the old address and the new address.<1>

**Summary**

This article outlines the subscription and payment policies for the magazine "Kaebyŏk" and associated publications in 1924. It mandates advance payment for subscriptions and postage, specifies the use of postal transfer accounts, prohibits payment substitution with stamps (except in remote areas with a surcharge), rejects cash-on-delivery, and details procedures for combined payments, requesting receipts/refunds, and address changes. For historians, this notice offers insights into the business practices and logistical challenges of Korean publishing houses during the colonial period, highlighting reliance on the postal system, the specific financial rules imposed on subscribers, and considerations for readers in geographically isolated areas. The mention of other publications like "Sin Yŏsŏng" and "Ŏrini" indicates the publisher's broader activities.
