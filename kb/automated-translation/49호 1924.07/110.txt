Discovery of a 300-Year-Old Stele

In early June, at the house of Kim Chun-mo (金俊模) at 34, 4-chōme, Old Yongsan Wŏnjŏng (舊龍山元町), while tearing out and repairing the ondol (underfloor heating), a massive stele (石碑) measuring 5 ch'ŏk 1 ch'on in length and 1 ch'ŏk 8 ch'on 7 pun in width was discovered beneath the heating flues (방고래). The stele was erected 300 years ago, in the 32nd year of the Chongzhen (崇禎) era [1659]. A partial transcription of the stele inscription follows:

Record on the Back of the Tombstone Epitaph for Gentleman Yi (李公), Chŏllyŏkpuwi (展力副尉)

(Previous text omitted)... Seeking out his hereditary virtues, the Yi (李) clan of Hamp'yŏng (咸平) originates from Yi Ŏn (彦), a Divine Martial Great General (神武大將軍) of Goryeo (高麗). From then on, the line of scholar-officials (士大夫) was unbroken. His great-grandfather was Posthumous Name Yun-u (諱允宇), a County Magistrate (縣監). His grandfather was Posthumous Name Yang (諱瑒), posthumously appointed Left State Councilor (贈左贊成). His father was Posthumous Name P'il-wŏn (諱弼元), holding the rank of Ŏmu[janggun?] (禦侮). He was commonly known in the world as Ku*gong (九*公). Ch'un-wŏn (春元) was his elder brother. (Middle part omitted)... Born in the Pyŏng'o year of the Wanli era (萬曆丙午) [1606], died on the 21st day of the second month in the Kyŏngjin year of the Chongzhen era (崇禎庚辰) [1640]. The tomb is in Kamch'ŏn-ni (甘川里), Kwangju (廣州)... (Remainder omitted) <51>

**Summary**

This article reports the discovery of a large, approximately 300-year-old stone stele (erected in 1659, Chongzhen era) during home renovations in the Yongsan district of Seoul (referred to by its colonial Japanese name, Wŏnjŏng/Motomachi). The stele is an epitaph for a man named Yi from the Hamp'yŏng Yi clan, holding the military rank Chŏllyŏkpuwi. The inscription details his lineage back to the Goryeo dynasty, listing ancestors' names and official positions, and gives his birth and death dates (1606-1640) and burial location in Kwangju. For historians of colonial Korea, the article is interesting as it documents the unearthing of a Joseon Dynasty artifact within a setting identified by its Japanese colonial place name (Yongsan Wŏnjŏng). This juxtaposition highlights the layering of history and the continuation of Korean cultural heritage discovery even under colonial rule, reported matter-of-factly in a Korean publication.
