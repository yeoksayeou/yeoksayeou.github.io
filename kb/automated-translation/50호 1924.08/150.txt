Sihŭng County: Giving Away the Pear and Begging for the Core

Even if I am unremarkable, my grandfather was a distinguished nobleman. Likewise, present-day Sihŭng (始興) is said to have once been a respected village of scholar-officials (士夫鄕), receiving deference unmatched by others. Hoam (虎岩) rock of the "North Fears the Lion, South Pities the Dog" (北畏獅南憐犬) fame, Naksŏngdae (落星臺) which received the astonished reverence of the Song envoy (宋使), Kwanaksan (冠岳山) mountain bright with Buddha's light, and Kach'asan (加次山) mountain which guards the spirits of the Six Martyred Ministers – all serve as reminders of the past for later generations. But beyond these, there were not a few figures like Kang Kam-ch'an (姜邯贊), who eradicated the tiger infestation (虎患) of Hanyang (漢陽), whipped and enumerated the crimes of the old dragon of Pak Yŏn (朴淵 老龍を 鞭朴數罪), shattered the 100,000 strong army of the Khitan (契丹) with his short three-ch'ŏk stature, and promoted the glory of his homeland; Sŏ Kyŏn (徐甄), who always sat facing north, refusing to face Hanyang (坐必向北不對漢陽); and Ku Myŏn (具면), Kang Ch'an (姜燦), and Yi Suk (李淑), who possessed both loyalty and filial piety (忠孝俱全). This alone seems enough for this region (州鄕) to boast about.

However, after these masters departed, the evidence of development in this region, which supposedly became a new world, is as follows: As the two major railway lines, the Kyŏngbu (京釜) and Kyŏngin (京仁) lines, pierced through its center, and the former county office was moved to Yŏngdŭngp'o (永登浦), the Mokrigun (木履軍, derogatory term likely referring to Japanese settlers wearing wooden clogs) from across the river swarmed into the vacant space like snakes. Because they looked around assessing opportunities (搖頭轉目), the native inhabitants (재래종족) lost everything – farmland, commercial rights, factories, and whatnot – without even knowing which malevolent spirit (使鬼) was snatching them away. The pitiful sight of them, wide-eyed yet crawling into the water [i.e., ruin], truly makes one's heart ache and sting the more one sees it.

Nevertheless, as hunger is the enemy (口腹이 怨讎), they inevitably bow their heads to them, struggling day by day for a meager existence (殘*을 허덕어리는 꼴) – how wretched is that sight? And what about the phenomenon of the vampires (흡혈귀) who have spread their nets of exploitation like spiderwebs in all directions, licking, wrapping up, and sucking dry until the very end? Please See Below:

**Summary**

This 1924 article laments the decline of Sihŭng County, once a respected area known for its scholar-officials and historical figures like Kang Kam-ch'an. The author contrasts its proud past with its current state, where the arrival of railways and the relocation of the county office led to the economic displacement of native Koreans by incoming Japanese settlers and businesses ("Mokrigun"). Koreans have lost land, commercial power, and factories, forced into subservient roles and unemployment, while Japanese economic entities dominate, depicted as exploitative "vampires." The article highlights the stark economic disparity and resentment felt by Koreans under Japanese colonial rule, using statistics on land ownership, tax payments, factory distribution, and unemployment to illustrate the point. For historians, this piece provides a contemporary perspective on the socio-economic impact of colonial infrastructure development (railways), the process of Japanese economic penetration into rural Korea, the resulting marginalization of the Korean population, and the palpable sense of loss and anger expressed through vivid, critical language. The statistics mentioned (though not detailed in this excerpt) offer potential quantitative data points regarding colonial economic structures.
