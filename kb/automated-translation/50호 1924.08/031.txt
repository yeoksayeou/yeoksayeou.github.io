Kaebyŏk South Manchuria General Branch Office <27>

**Summary**

This article is a company announcement from the publisher of *Kaebyŏk*, *Sin Yŏsŏng*, and *Ŏrini* magazines, informing readers of the establishment of a new branch office in Sŏgando (West Jiandao), Manchuria. It details the branch's location in Hwanin County, its jurisdictional area covering four counties in Pongch'ŏn Province (Fengtian Province), and lists the key staff members, including the branch manager, reporters, and an advisor. For historians, this announcement is significant as it documents the expansion of Korean publishing and cultural activities into Manchuria during the Japanese colonial period, specifically targeting the Korean diaspora population in the Sŏgando region, which was also a hub for the independence movement. The naming of specific individuals involved provides valuable data for research on Korean activities in Manchuria at this time.
