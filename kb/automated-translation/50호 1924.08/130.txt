**Body Text Translation:**
Kind Notice

Since the beginning of the Gapja Year [甲子年, 1924], our magazine, Gaebyeok (開闢), has faced monthly confiscations (押收). As soon as they were confiscated, we published temporary issues (臨時號); as soon as temporary issues went out of print (絶版), we reprinted (增刷); and despite repeated reprints, we have been utterly unable to meet (酬應) the requests (請求) that exceeded our expectations (豫想以上). Consequently, although we preemptively printed several thousand additional copies of the July issue, our 4th-anniversary special, it still went out of print about 10 days after publication. Therefore, for requests received after the 15th, we have no choice but to send the upcoming August issue as a substitute (代送). We ask all our readers (독자제위) for your understanding (용허) of our company's situation.

Gaebyeoksa Sales Department <68>

**Summary**

This notice from the Gaebyeoksa Sales Department explains that due to repeated confiscations (押收) by authorities since the start of 1924 (甲子年), followed by unexpectedly high demand that led to rapid sell-outs (絶版) even after reprints (增刷), they were unable to fulfill all orders for the July 4th-anniversary issue. Readers who ordered after July 15th will receive the August issue instead. The article is significant for colonial history as it directly references the censorship and suppression (confiscation) faced by Korean publications under Japanese rule. It simultaneously highlights the resilience of the publisher and the strong public demand for the magazine, suggesting its importance as a likely vehicle for Korean cultural or nationalist discourse despite official pressure.
