						穀明 卞榮晩

Someone asked the Master, saying: "When a person dies, can there be something immortal that remains? Or does it vanish completely? I wish to hear your instruction on this." The Master sighed deeply and said: "This is something the sages of old hesitated to speak of, and about which even contemporary philosophers are tongue-tied. A difficult question indeed! However, I shall attempt to discuss it. If there is something that does not die along with death, then it must certainly be something that does not live dependent on life. If it does not depend on life to live, its origins cannot be investigated. If it does not die along with death, its destination is difficult to fathom. This could be called transcendently self-existing, perpetually bright and long-continuing, without darkness, covering, or separation. But then, I do not know, before you and I were born into this world, where that which is called 'not dependent on life to live' resided for you and me. Was it in the vastness of emptiness? The unfathomability of the sea? Or the tightest gap between wood and stone? Or perhaps riding clouds and rainbows, clasping wind and thunder, roaming proudly through the world of stars? Can you recall it, even dimly? You surely cannot, and neither can I. If so, why is it that this 'transcendently self-existing, perpetually bright and long-continuing, without darkness, covering, or separation' has one day become obscured to this extent? How strange it is! Could it be that the brightness attaches to substance, and substance obscures and confuses it? That the spirit resides near *ki* (vital energy), and *ki* darkens and muddles it? This makes it seem as if it were sometimes obscured, sometimes cut off. If you shake a drunkard and ask his name and address, it's not difficult for him to utter something隨口而有發 (whatever comes to mouth). I did not expect the intoxication of this life to reach such a state of stupor (酩酊)! Wandering a dreamscape and meeting a friend, one can happily chat about old times. I did not expect the dream of this world to reach such a black sweetness (deep sleep/dream)! If this is so, can one still say that there might be something that does not die along with death, that it exists? It is decidedly not so.

You are still not convinced? Let me use light as an analogy. Light is indeed not what was previously called 'bright and spiritual'. Yet among things that are not substance, it ranks below [spirit]. Bright and spiritual cannot be extinguished; light also cannot be extinguished. How is it then that light now arises and is extinguished with such impermanence? The light of the sun, the light of a volcano – their light is too great and unsuitable for analogy. Why not take the smallest of insects, the firefly (螢), and examine it? The firefly comes out at night and has light; it is truly marvelous and strange. Yet, ask where it comes from. Is it after rotten grass (腐草)? Or a descendant of decayed dung (敗糞)? Even a flatterer (善諛者) could not hide its lowliness. For the preciousness of light to be entrusted to such lowliness – what could be more incongruous? Nevertheless, because of this incongruity, can light exist before the firefly? Can it shine alone after the firefly? When ten thousand fireflies are born, ten thousand lights are also born. When ten thousand fireflies perish, ten thousand lights also perish, that is all.

Furthermore, there is this to say: when the firefly comes out at night and flies up and down, is it entirely caused by being pulled by the wind? It is also the quiet, elegant intent (雅懷) of the firefly itself. Then, within the firefly, there must also be one thing that is minutely bright and minutely spiritual (微昭而微靈者一物矣). What will become of this minute thing? Will it still virtuously guard its small brightness, not let fall its precious life (寶命), one day escape beyond its physical form, and ascend to that faraway homeland of the Emperor (帝鄕, Heaven)? If the firefly can do this, then it goes without saying for toads, snakes, fish, and turtles (蟾蛇魚鱉). As for the lion roaring in the wild (吼埜之獅) or the tiger backed into a corner (負嵎之虎), whose brilliance (英彩) appears a hundred times greater than a human's, one need not even ask. However, no person speaks like this. How can one discuss human partiality (偏僻)? You may leave."

The questioner (士貫擧 - perhaps 'the scholar who raised the thread' or simply 'the man') considered it once and thrice again, then suddenly, with a cleansed expression (灑然革容), stood up, bowed, and said: "Master, rare in this world! Though humans are the noblest of things, this mere seven-*ch'ŏk* body (七尺之軀) is, by comparison, like the drum to the sound. It is like the flower to the fragrance. It is like the cake (餠) to the taste. If the drum is not struck, the sound disappears without a trace. Without the flower, without the cake, how can there be fragrance and taste? Alas (噫)! This disciple has long been blind (瞽). Now, through the analogy (喩), I understand."<37>

**Summary**

The article presents a philosophical dialogue where a "Master," likely representing the author Pyŏn Yŏngman, argues against the existence of an immortal soul or consciousness separate from the body. Using analogies like the light of a firefly being dependent on the firefly, or sound on a drum, the Master posits that consciousness is an emergent property of the physical body ("substance" and "ki") and ceases to exist upon death. The Master criticizes human arrogance in assuming only they possess a potentially immortal essence, while dismissing similar possibilities in animals, even those appearing more vibrant. The questioner is eventually convinced by the analogies. From a historical perspective, the article is interesting as it reflects the engagement of Korean intellectuals with modern philosophical materialism during the colonial period, challenging traditional spiritual beliefs. The use of classical Chinese structure and vocabulary within a modern Korean context highlights the transitional literary and intellectual environment of the 1920s. Historians might find the directness of the argument against soul-body dualism and the critique of anthropocentrism notable for the time.
