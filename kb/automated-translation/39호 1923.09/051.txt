**Summary**

This notice informs readers that the September 1923 issue of the magazine *Kaebyŏk* was confiscated by authorities immediately upon publication. To continue publishing, the editors removed two potentially controversial articles: one by Syŏng T'ae on "Red Terror and White Terror" and another by Kim Chawŏn discussing the magazine's stance towards the Government-General. They replaced these with an article by Pak Ŭnsik about post-revolutionary China and issued this revised version as a special (臨時號, imsiho) issue, asking for readers' understanding. This incident starkly illustrates the censorship faced by Korean publications under Japanese colonial rule and the strategies magazines employed to navigate these restrictions while still attempting to disseminate information and viewpoints, albeit altered. Historians would find this notice valuable for understanding press control, nationalist resistance through media, and the specific topics deemed sensitive by the Government-General in 1923.
