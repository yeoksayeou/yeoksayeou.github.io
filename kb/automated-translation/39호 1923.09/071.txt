Article Title: 府尹이 府尹 (The Mayor is the Mayor)
Article Type: 잡저 (Miscellaneous writing)

As for rumors in the world, they are conveyed this way and that way. In the previous issue of this magazine, there was a story that the Mayor (府尹) of Sĭnŭiju had secretly bought tobacco (煙草) from Andong and such-and-such happened. Since the Mayor is the Mayor (府尹이 府尹이라), thinking surely such a thing couldn't have happened, we investigated the news from that side further. It turns out it wasn't the Mayor himself who did such a thing, but a certain relative of a certain City Council Member (府協議員) within that city who did that kind of act. At that time, the Mayor, truly thinking, "I am the Mayor, after all" (나는 府尹이거니), tried to cover for that misconduct by lending his name card (名啣), intending to defend the wrongdoing of that certain person (ultimately, this too was unsuccessful). That's about what actually happened. Since it happened to that extent, it's not strange (怪치) that such a rumor spread. However, the fortunate thing is that, since the Mayor is the Mayor (府尹이 府尹이라), although he might have lent his name card even to a distant in-law, thinking "I am the Mayor, after all" (내가 府尹이거니), he did not go so far as to secretly buy tobacco himself. <48>

**Summary**

This short article addresses a rumor previously mentioned in the magazine about the Mayor of Sĭnŭiju smuggling tobacco. It clarifies that the Mayor himself wasn't the smuggler, but rather a relative of a city council member. However, the Mayor did attempt to use his position and name card to help cover up the relative's actions, although unsuccessfully. The article concludes it was fortunate the Mayor's direct involvement didn't extend to the smuggling itself, despite his questionable attempt to use his influence. For historians, this piece offers a glimpse into the social dynamics and rumors surrounding colonial officials (even Korean ones like a Puyun), the misuse of official status, and how news (or gossip) circulated and was corrected in colonial Korean society via publications like *Kaebyŏk*. It highlights issues of petty corruption or influence-peddling and the scrutiny such actions faced.

府尹이 府尹

세상의 소문이란, 이러케도 전하고, 뎌러케도 전하는 것이다. 本誌 前號에, 新義州 府尹이 安東으로부터 煙草를 密買入하다가 여차여차 하엿다는 말이 이섯다. 府尹이 府尹이라, 설마 그랫슬 수야 잇스랴 하야, 더 한번 그 편의 소식을 探하면, 府尹 자신이, 그런 것이 아니라, 그 府內의 府協議員되는 某의 친족되는 某가, 그따위 즛을 하엿난대, 그때의 府尹은, 정말노, 「나는 府尹이거니」하고, 자기의 名啣을 빌녀 주어써, 某의 그 非行을 변호하려 하얏다(결국은 그도 不成功)는 말이다. 사실은 그쯤 된 것이다. 그쯤 된 것이니, 그만한 소문이 나기도 怪치는 아는 일이다. 그러나 다행한 것은, 府尹이 府尹이라, 「내가 府尹이거니」하고 사둔의 팔촌되는 사람에게까지 名啣은 빌녀주엇슬지 연뎡, 「내가 府尹이거니」하고 煙草 密買入까지는 안이한 그것이다.＜48＞
