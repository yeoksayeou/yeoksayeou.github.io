**Summary**

This company notice announces changes to the P'yŏngnam branch of Kaebyŏk magazine in September 1923. The branch was renamed the P'yŏngyang Branch, relocated to a new address within P'yŏngyang, and saw a complete change in key personnel, with Yi Kisŏl, Sŏnu O, and Kim Taryŏng replacing the previous staff. The notice directs all business, including subscriptions, advertising, article submissions, and payments, to the new team. For historians, this notice provides concrete details about the organizational expansion and administration of a major Korean cultural and nationalist publication during the colonial period. It shows the magazine establishing a formal presence in P'yŏngyang, a significant regional center, and highlights the practicalities of running such an enterprise, including staffing and public communication, under Japanese rule.
