傷心一事 (A Heartbreaking Matter)

What reason is this? Fierce winds and torrential rains are in the heavens, and angry waves and mad billows rise from the sea. Beyond merely living near the river or the sea, what sins did they commit? Yet, countless brethren in the entire area of West Chosŏn, centered around P'yŏngyang, Chinnamp'o, and Yongch'ŏn, have been tragically trampled by those fierce winds and torrential rains, those angry waves and mad billows. Pickle jars float away, houses float away, fields and paddies are ruined (僞하야); they have no homes to sleep in, no food to eat, no ground to work on. The sight of them, empty-handed (뷔인들) and naked on the riverbank, holding onto each other and wailing, is cruel enough, but how much more惨혹하다 the spectacle of burying four hundred corpses in one pit, collapsing one after another (녁일코 넘어지는)? Heaven grieves, Earth weeps; we do not know how to describe it (其 形喻할 바를 모르겟도다). Alas! If the money or goods we possess could be of any help in rescuing them from their慘狀惨状, what reason would we have to hesitate?

※※※※

Amidst such tragic disasters, what feels particularly heartbreaking are those pitiable farmers and laborers (농무) who lived without power or money. Whether called a natural disaster or whatnot, those who live with much power and much money are not affected by such calamities from the start, or even if, by one chance in a hundred or one in a thousand, they are affected, they are the first to receive aid and also the first to recover. But for powerless Chosŏn people, for the moneyless proletariat (無産者), what rescue is there? (Of course, it might not be entirely absent), and what recovery is there? Pressed by power, chased by livelihood to the seashores and riverbanks, those without strength and without money perish on this occasion or that.

We heard such words from P'yŏngyang after the waters receded (물 后).
At the time when the waters of the Taedong River flowed over the upper part (웃목) of Ryŏngwang Pavilion (練光亭), turning the old and new city areas of P'yŏngyang into a water kingdom, on the side (그) of the old city, the coming and going (來往) of patrol boats amounted to merely two, whereas on the side (그) of the new city, patrol boats were said to handle even the delivery of private messages (私事傳喝) from this two-story house (二層집) to that two-story house.

Another young man happened to experience that flood in a certain village market in Taedong County. The patrol boats in that market only sought out people who had even a little money, largely pretending not to see (본쳑만쳑함으로) the houses of the moneyless common folk. Thus, this young man became agitated by this, ran about tirelessly by himself (自己獨力으로 奔走不睍하다가), and ended up suffering a mental breakdown (情神에 異狀이 생기엿다고).

Heartbreak upon heartbreak, we truly do not know what to say (云爲할바를 모르겟도다). This damned world, what on earth must be done to make it right (올탄)?<1>

**Summary**

The article laments the devastating floods that struck West Chosŏn (Korea), particularly affecting P'yŏngyang, Chinnamp'o, and Yongch'ŏn. It highlights the immense suffering of the populace, especially the poor farmers and laborers who lost everything. The author contrasts this with the relative safety and prioritized rescue of the wealthy and powerful. Anecdotes from P'yŏngyang and Taedong County illustrate this disparity, showing how rescue efforts favored the affluent areas and individuals, leading to intense frustration and even psychological trauma among those witnessing the injustice. The piece concludes with despair about the state of the world and the deep social inequalities exacerbated by the disaster.

From a historical perspective, this article is significant as it provides a raw, contemporary critique of social stratification and perceived discriminatory practices during a crisis under Japanese colonial rule. It underscores the vulnerability of the Korean peasant and proletarian classes and implies criticism of the authorities (likely Japanese or collaborating Korean elites, symbolized by the patrol boats) for prioritizing the wealthy, even in life-or-death situations. Historians might find the specific examples of unequal resource distribution (patrol boats) and the expressed sense of injustice valuable for understanding social tensions and the lived experience of Koreans during this period.

傷心一事
이 엇진 닭이냐, 한울에 烈風淫雨가 잇고, 바다에 怒濤狂瀾이 닐도다. 다못 江 갓가히 살고, 바다 갓가히 사는 以外에, 그들에게 무슨 罪過가 잇섯더냐, 그러나, 平壤, 鎭南浦, 龍川을 中心삼은 西朝鮮 一帶의 幾多의 兄弟는, 無慘하게도 그 烈風淫雨, 그 怒濤狂瀾에 蹂躪이 되고 마럿다. 쟝독이 고, 집이 고, 논밧이 僞하야, 자려도 집이 업고, 먹으려도 糧食이 업고, 일할려도 터가 업서, 뷔인들, 헐버슨 江갓에 서로 붓들고 呼哭하는 그들의 情景도 慘酷하거든, 四百의 屍體를 한 구덩에 뭇고, 녁일코 넘어지는 그네의 慘景이 엇더할가. 天愁地泣, 우리는 其 形喻할 바를 모르겟도다. 嗚呼라, 우리의 가진 돈이나  物件이 그들의 慘狀을 救助하는 一助가 된다하면, 우리가  무엇을 蹰躇하리요.
※※※※
이러한 慘害中에서도, 別로히 맘 압흐게 생각되는 것은, 勢力업시, 돈 업시 살어가던 可憐한 농무 그들이다. 天災이니, 무엇이니 하여도, 勢力만코 돈 만케 살어가는 그네들은, 처음부터 그 災殃에 걸리지도 아니하며, 或 百에하나, 千에 하나 걸렷다 할지라도, 그들은 누구보다도 먼저 救急도 되는 것이오,  恢復도되는 것이다. 그러나 勢力업는 朝鮮사람, 돈업는 無産者에게야 救急이, 무슨 救急(勿論 아조 업는 것은 아니겟지)이며, 恢復이 무슨 恢復이냐. 勢力에 눌리우고, 生活에 기워서 바다갓, 江가으로 몰러운, 힘업고 돈업는 그들은, 이런 機會, 저런 機會에 破滅되고 말도다.
※※※※
우리는 물 后의 平壤에서 이러한 말을 들엇다.
大同江물이 練光亭 웃목으로 넘어, 平壤의 新舊市街가 한창 水國으로 化할 그에, 舊市街의 그에는, 警備船의 來往이 單 두隻에 不過하엿는데, 新市街의 그에서는, 이 二層집에서 저 二層집에의 私事傳喝지를 警備船이 担行하엿다고.
 엇던 靑年은, 마츰 그 水亂을 大同郡의 엇던 村市에서 격것는대, 그 市中의 警備船은, 그 市中에서도 돈 兩이나 잇는 사람만 차저단이고, 돈업는 百姓들의 집은, 거의 본쳑만쳑함으로, 그 靑年은 여긔에 興奮되야, 自己獨力으로 奔走不睍하다가, 그만 情神에 異狀이 생기엿다고.
※※※※
傷心  傷心, 우리는 實로 云爲할바를 모르겟도다. 이놈의 世上을, 大體 엇더케 하여야 올탄 말인고.＜1＞
