To those with intention, I earnestly request:

As a sacrificial endeavor for the Children's Movement (少年運動), which is the fundamental movement of Human Movement (人間運動), the Youth and Girls' Magazine 『Ŏrini』 (『어린이』), published by our company (本社) since last spring (去春), has gained a public reputation (定評) for its noble (高潔) and substantial (充實) content. It has been genuinely welcomed by tens of thousands of boys and girls (少年少女) and their parents (父兄). In particular, the upcoming issue (入號) to be published on the fifteenth of this month is edited as a commemorative issue for the All-Korea (全鮮) Youth Leaders Conference, also serving as a special autumn issue (秋季 特刊號). Leaders from all over Korea (全鮮 各地) who strive in the noble work of guiding youth have each poured out their feelings (情) to contribute an article, collecting them as a precious and valuable gift sent to all the youth of Korea (全鮮 少年들).

It contains five delightful fairy tales (童話), four affectionate instructive talks (訓話), four beautiful and clean children's songs (童謠) (with musical scores (曲譜付)), one beneficial and interesting scientific explanation (科學說明), plus even an easily performable children's play (童話劇), and kindly introduces even new recreational methods (新避戱法) – nearly twenty articles in total, each accompanied by the author's photograph (筆者의 寫眞). In addition, it announces three novel prize competitions (懸賞問題), which boys and girls delight in the most. Truly, it lacks nothing in terms of cultivation (修養), entertainment (娛樂), interest (趣味), and practical benefit (實益). In order to place this noble gift into the arms of many companions (동모), it has been decided to sell it for a mere ten chŏn (十錢), which does not even cover the actual cost (實費). Therefore, we unhesitatingly introduce it to our Kaebyŏk (開闢) readers. Whether you are a parent with children or nephews/nieces (子姪), or a teacher holding the pointer (敎鞭), we earnestly hope you will obtain this volume, read it first, and then pass it on to your children/nephews/nieces or students (學生).

『Ŏrini』 Issue 8, Special Edition. One volume, Ten Chŏn. Published by Kaebyŏk Publishing Company (開闢社). <122>

**Summary**

This article is an announcement and advertisement from the Kaebyŏk Publishing Company promoting the upcoming eighth issue of their children's magazine, 『Ŏrini』. It highlights that this special autumn issue commemorates the All-Korea Youth Leaders Conference and features diverse content like stories, songs with scores, science articles, a play script, and prize contests, contributed by youth leaders from across Korea. Emphasizing the magazine's high quality and educational value, the publisher urges Kaebyŏk readers, especially parents and teachers, to purchase the issue for children at the subsidized price of ten chŏn. From a historical perspective, the text reveals the active promotion of children's education and cultural movements (Sonyŏn Undong) during the colonial period, spearheaded by publications like 『Ŏrini』. The mention of an "All-Korea Youth Leaders Conference" signifies organized efforts in youth guidance, while the subsidized price and description of the publishing as a "sacrificial endeavor" suggest the publishers' commitment, possibly nationalistic or social, to disseminating knowledge despite potential hardships under Japanese rule. The use of "Chŏnsŏn" (全鮮) for Korea is also characteristic of the era.
