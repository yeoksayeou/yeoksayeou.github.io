In my visit to Seoul this last tima I was impressed by a new spirit of energy and enterprise. I believe that the Korean people have decided to make the most of their present opportunities. It they do do, I am sure that they will not only make great propress and a sound development, but that they will gain the respect and best wishes of the world at large. This energy and enterprise show themselves in a thousand ways. Among them are a notable interest in education and a hunger for reading.
I was interested in the evident prosperity of Chun-do. Your new buildings are well adapted to the propagation and carrying on of your purposes. I am told that your magayine is popular and doing a great work of popular education. In so far as your movement stimulates and developes a wholesome Korean selfcounsciousners, it has my hearty sympathy.

As previously mentioned, Dr. Starr had promised to contribute an article or essay to this magazine. Perhaps in lieu of that promise, the above personal letter arrived at our company office at the end of last July, so we publish the original text along with its translation as follows.

When I went to Kyŏngsŏng this time, I was impressed that there was a new spirit of vitality and enterprise. Therefore, I believe that the Chosŏn people have decided to utilize their present opportunities as much as possible. If only they do so, I am confident that they will not only make great progress and solid development, but that they will furthermore gain the respect and boundless goodwill from the people of the entire world. This vitality and enterprise are already showing themselves in various aspects. Among these, education and a passion for reading draw noble interest.
I regarded the seemingly flourishing prosperity of Ch'ŏndogyo with keen interest. I thought your new buildings are most suitable for the propagation of the religion and the management of your enterprises. I also heard that your esteemed magazine is well-regarded and making a great contribution to social education.
Insofar as your esteemed magazine's movement lies in stimulating and developing a beneficial self-awareness among the Chosŏn people, I shall not withhold my heartfelt sympathy for it.

**Summary**

This article presents a letter from American anthropologist Frederick Starr, sent to the magazine *Kaebyŏk* (개벽) in July 1921. Starr expresses his positive impressions from a recent visit to Seoul (Kyŏngsŏng), noting a "new spirit of energy and enterprise" among Koreans, particularly their interest in education and reading. He praises the visible prosperity of the Ch'ŏndogyo religion and its new buildings, and commends *Kaebyŏk* magazine for its popularity and contribution to social education, offering his sympathy for its efforts in fostering Korean self-awareness. The magazine editors add brief introductory and concluding notes. For historians, this piece is interesting as it provides a contemporary foreign observer's optimistic view of Korean society's morale and cultural/educational activities (specifically linked to Ch'ŏndogyo) during the early, repressive phase of Japanese colonial rule. Starr's encouragement of "wholesome Korean selfconsciousness" is particularly notable.
