**Summary**

This short piece lists traditional metaphors used by "ancients" to describe the perceived character or temperament of people from Korea's historical eight provinces. Each province is assigned a poetic, and sometimes stereotypical, image, such as the "fierce tiger" for P'yŏngan Province or the "dogs fighting in a muddy field" for Hamgyŏng Province. From a historical perspective, this article provides a glimpse into regional stereotypes prevalent in early colonial Korea. Historians might find it valuable for understanding how regional identities were characterized and perhaps perpetuated during this period, reflecting long-standing cultural perceptions.
