Location: Ŭpnae, Kwangju-gun (光州郡)
Branch Manager & Reporter: Choe T'aeryŏl (崔泰烈)
General Affairs Manager: Kim Sŏngdae (金聲大)

**Summary**

This article is a company announcement from the magazine *Kaebyŏk* declaring the establishment of its Chŏlla Namdo (South Jeolla Province) branch office in Kwangju-gun. It lists the branch manager/reporter Choe T'aeryŏl and general affairs manager Kim Sŏngdae. The announcement clarifies that the head office remains responsible for delivering the magazine issues, while the new branch office will handle payments. Existing distribution points will continue under their old rules. For historians, this notice reveals the expanding organizational structure and reach of a major Korean nationalist magazine in the early colonial period, showing its efforts to engage readers provincially. The division of labor between the head office (distribution) and branch (payments) is also noteworthy for understanding business practices of the time.
