三防瀑布
						黙齋

Rushing forth wildly, roaring madly, its force is hard to withstand,
Scattered spray falls like fine rain, filling the valley with coolness,
Though they say the world's burning dust cannot fly here,
To conceal a cave dwelling, it hangs like a long curtain.<117>

**Summary**

This short poem, written in Hanja, vividly describes the Sambang Waterfall. The poet depicts its powerful rush, the cool mist it creates, and portrays it as a secluded haven, hidden from the "burning dust" of the world, like a curtain concealing a hidden dwelling. From a colonial history perspective, while not overtly political, the poem's focus on the enduring power and beauty of a specific Korean natural landmark (Sambang Waterfall) can be seen as a subtle affirmation of Korean landscape and perhaps an implicit yearning for refuge or purity away from the troubles of the era. Such nature depictions were common forms of expression when direct political commentary was restricted.
