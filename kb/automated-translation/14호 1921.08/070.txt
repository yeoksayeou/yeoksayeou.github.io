Southern Song Philosophy
*During the time of Yejang (預章, Lo Ts'ung-yen) and Yi Yŏnp'yŏng (李延平, Yi T'ŏng), the state altars of Song gradually suffered the lash of the barbarians (夷狄), and in the first year of Chien-yen (建炎元年) (1127 AD), Emperor Kao-tsung (高宗) took the throne in the Southern Capital (南京), hence it was called the Southern Song (南宋).

Chu Hsi's Learning (*Chuhak*, 朱學)... Chu Hsi (朱子) (Biography and Writings)

Chu Hui-an's (朱晦菴) given name was Hsi (熹) and his courtesy name was Yüan-hui (元晦); he was a person from Hui-chou (嶶州). His father's name was Sung (松) and courtesy name was Ch'iao-nien (喬年); like Yi Yŏnp'yŏng, he studied under Lo Yejang (羅預章). He passed the *chin-shih* (進士) examination and took office, but he did not approve of the peace treaty with the Jin (金) state and ultimately offended the chancellor Ch'in Kuei (秦檜). In the 4th year of Chien-yen (1130 AD), he was dismissed from office and resided below Hsiu Peak (秀峯) outside Yu-hsi (友溪) county town. In the 9th month of that year, a son was born, who was Hui-an (晦菴, Chu Hsi). From childhood, he was conspicuously perceptive and different from other children. When he was 4 years old, his father pointed to the sky (天) and taught him about its 'sky-ness'. Suddenly, he asked, "What else is there above the sky?" At 14, following his father's dying instructions, he studied under Liu Chih-chung (劉致中), and at 24, he studied under Yi Yŏnp'yŏng. During Emperor Kao-tsung's reign, he submitted a memorial regarding the barbarian issue, internally criticizing court officials and arguing against the peace treaty. The emperor was angered and sought to execute him, but Chancellor Chao Hsiung (趙雄) interceded and stopped it. On the 3rd day of the 6th month of Ch'ing-yüan 6 (1200 AD), he fell ill, entrusted his learning to his disciples, and the next day, adjusted his cap and robes, lay down on his pillow, and passed away peacefully. Later, he was given the posthumous name Wen-kung (文公). During Emperor Li-tsung's (理宗) reign, he was granted the title Grand Master (大師) and posthumously enfeoffed as Duke of Hsin (信國公). His writings are quite numerous: *Chang-chü* (章句) and *Huo-wen* (或問) on the *Great Learning* (大學) and *Doctrine of the Mean* (中庸), *T'ai-chi-t'u shuo chieh* (太極圖解, Explanation of the Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate), *T'ung-shu chieh* (通書解, Explanation of the Penetrating Book), *I pen-i* (易本義, Original Meaning of the Changes), *Ch'i-meng* (啓蒙, Introduction to the Study of the Changes), *Shih-kua kung-wu* (蓍卦攻誤, Correction of Errors in Divination by Yarrow Stalks), *Lun-yü chi-chu* (論語集註, Collected Commentaries on the Analects), *Meng-tzu chi-chu* (孟子集註, Collected Commentaries on Mencius), *Shih chi-chuan* (詩集傳, Collected Commentaries on the Odes), *Ch'u-tz'u chi-chu* (楚辭集註, Collected Commentaries on the Songs of Ch'u), *Han Wen k'ao-i* (韓文考異, Examination of Variants in Han Yü's Writings), *Lun Meng chi-i* (論孟集議, Collected Discussions on the Analects and Mencius), *Meng-tzu chih-yao* (孟子指要, Essentials of Mencius), *Chung-yung chi-lüeh* (中庸輯略, Abridged Compilation on the Doctrine of the Mean), *Hsiao-ching k'an-wu* (孝經刊誤, Correction of Errors in the Classic of Filiality), *Hsiao-hsüeh* (小學, Elementary Learning), *Hsieh Shang-ts'ai yü-lu* (謝上蔡語錄, Recorded Sayings of Hsieh Liang-tso), *Yen-p'ing wen-ta* (延平問答, Questions and Answers with Yi Yŏnp'yŏng), *Sung ming-ch'en yen-hsing lu* (宋名臣言行錄, Records of Words and Deeds of Famous Officials of the Song), *Ch'eng-shih wai-shu* (程氏外書, Outer Writings of the Ch'eng Masters), *Ch'eng-shih i-shu* (程氏遺書, Surviving Writings of the Ch'eng Masters), *Chia-li* (家禮, Family Rituals), *Chin-ssu lu* (近思錄, Reflections on Things at Hand), *T'ung-chien kang-mu* (通鑑綱目, Outline and Digest of the Comprehensive Mirror), *I-Lo yüan-yüan lu* (伊洛淵源錄, Record of the Origins of the School of the Ch'eng Brothers), *Cheng-meng chieh* (正蒙解, Explanation of Correcting Youthful Ignorance), etc. His lifetime works amount to 100 volumes in total, along with student dialogues <46> *Chu-tzu yü-lu* (朱子語錄, Recorded Sayings of Master Chu), *Chu-tzu yü-lei* (朱子語類, Classified Conversations of Master Chu), etc.

His Philosophy = *Li-Qi* (理氣)
Chu Hsi inherited the thought of I-ch'uan (伊川, Ch'eng I) and advocated for the two concepts of *li* (理, principle) and *qi* (氣, vital force). He also determined that Chou Tun-i's (周子) Supreme Ultimate (*T'aegŭk*, 太極) is *li*. Therefore, he said, "It is just one *li*, and because it is the ultimate point, it is called the Supreme Ultimate." Thus, the Supreme Ultimate and *li* differ only in the point of view: when viewed from the deep foundation of the myriad things, it is called the Supreme Ultimate; when viewed in contrast to *qi*, it is called *li*.
Chu Hsi believed that all phenomena in the universe are formed from the synthesis of *li* and *qi*. When humans and things are generated, they invariably receive this *li* to form their nature (*sŏng*, 性) and receive this *qi* to form their physical form (*hyŏng*, 形); nature and form are necessarily existent. However, *li* and *qi* can absolutely never exist separately. When there is no *qi*, *li* has nothing to attach to, and without *li*, *qi* cannot form a shape. Therefore, there is no *li* without *qi*, and no *qi* without *li*.
Further discussing the functional distinction between *li* and *qi*, *li* is the Way (道) above physical form, the principle by which the myriad things are generated. *Qi* is the vessel (器) below physical form, the material which is governed by *li* and molded into form. *Qi* itself has no movement; it must await *li*, and only after following the direction of *li* can it then flow and operate.
Therefore, *li* and *qi* cannot be discussed in terms of temporal priority. Chu Hsi, believing in the theory of the beginning of Heaven and Earth and the Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate, also stated, "Before Heaven and Earth were generated, there was only *li*." However, he immediately followed this by saying, "If there is *li*, then there are Heaven and Earth." Although his thought lacks some clarity in this precise point, it is generally somewhat clear on the point that *li* and *qi* cannot be discussed in terms of temporal priority.
Generally, while *li* and *qi* cannot be discussed in terms of temporal priority, their fundamentality or lack thereof can be discussed in terms of their self-existent status. When discussed in this way, *li* must be called fundamental, and *qi* must be called attendant. Therefore, in response to someone discussing *li* and *qi*, he said, "Where there is this *li*, there is this *qi*, but *li* is the basis (本)."
However, *li* does not exist as a separate entity; it too exists only within *qi*.
Yet, Chu Hsi's conception of *li* is not like the reality and phenomenon advocated by modern Western philosophers; rather, the dualism of *li* and *qi* combines to form individual phenomena. It is just that *li*, in relation to *qi*, is fundamental in its self-existent status. <47>

Unity of *Li*
*Li* disperses and exists in the myriad things, yet it can be unified; this is the single origin (一原) of the myriad things. Viewed from the aspect of the distinctness of the myriad things, it is a fact that *li* is not identical [in each]. For this reason, *li* is one aspect [of reality]. When viewing *li* from this perspective, Chu Hsi attached numerous headings to the Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate, believing that "Each person possesses one Supreme Ultimate, and each thing possesses one Supreme Ultimate. Speaking collectively, the myriad things are systematically unified in one Supreme Ultimate. Speaking distributively, each thing is individually endowed with one Supreme Ultimate." He also used an analogy to explain that the Supreme Ultimate in each thing is no different from the original Supreme Ultimate, saying, "A single grain of millet grows and becomes a sprout, the sprout produces flowers, the flowers form fruit, and when the fruit ripens, it returns to its original form. There may be a hundred grains on one ear, but each grain is individually complete. Also, if these hundred grains are planted, each grain again produces a hundred grains, and there is no end to this. Yet, it is an undeniable fact that these too originated from the initial single grain. Similarly, although each thing has its own *li*, it is ultimately just one *li*." If this is so, then the Supreme Ultimate must inevitably be one and also myriad, omniscient and omnipotent.
If so, then even animals, plants, and trees, which possess such great differences, also invariably possess this one *li*. Therefore, it is said: "Externally, regarding humans, the *li* of humans is not outside oneself; distantly, regarding things, the *li* of things is also not different from that of humans. At its greatest extent, the movements of Heaven and Earth, the changes of past and present, cannot be outside it. At its smallest, the minuteness of a single speck of dust, the duration of a single breath, cannot be left out. This is the inner core bestowed by the Supreme Lord (上帝), the constant norm upheld by the teeming people (烝民), what Master Liu (劉子, Liu Chih-chung?) called the center of Heaven and Earth (天地之中), what Confucius (孔子) called nature and the Way of Heaven (性與天道), what Tzu-ssu (子思) called the nature endowed by Heaven's mandate (天命之性), what Mencius (孟子) called the mind of benevolence and righteousness (仁義之心), what Master Ch'eng (程子) called the naturally existing center (天然自有之中), what Master Chang (張子, Chang Tsai) called the single origin of the myriad things (萬物之一原), what Master Shao (卲子, Shao Yung) called the form and substance of the Way (道之形體)." This is precisely it.
Therefore, for Chu Hsi, there is a common, universal *li*, but it seems there is no particular, concrete *li* limited to just one thing. This is said to be the crucial point of Chu Hsi's philosophy.

Distinction of *Qi*
Chu Hsi said, "Speaking in terms of *li*, there is nothing incomplete; speaking in terms of *qi*, partiality cannot be avoided." There are no distinctions in *li*, but *qi* has various differences. There are clear and limpid types, and turbid types, impossible to enumerate one by one; this is the reason for the distinctions among the myriad things. However, there is nothing that does not possess the Supreme Ultimate; its state is exactly like a pearl in water. In sages and worthies, it is like being in clear water, its pure light naturally manifesting. In the extremely foolish and unworthy, it is like being in turbid water; unless the mud is cleared, its light cannot be seen.
This is not only said regarding the same human race; the difference between humans and things is also solely a difference in *qi*. Therefore, it is said, "Those who obtain its refined essence (精英) become human; those who obtain its dregs (渣滓) become things. It is not initially said that the complete *qi* is given to humans, and a lesser grade is given to things. <48> It is just the endowment they receive. Things are inherently dull and obstructed, but even within this dullness and obstruction, there are degrees of lightness and heaviness." This is the difference between humans and things.

Natural Philosophy

Theory of the Generation of Heaven, Earth, and Myriad Things?
The Supreme Ultimate is the principle by which Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things are generated. In the beginning, there was the chaotic, undifferentiated primordial *qi* (一元氣). Through movement, it produced Yang; through stillness, it produced Yin. Later, it produced Water and Fire, and then Wood, Metal, and Earth were produced. Thus, the Two *Qi* (二氣, Yin and Yang) and the Five Phases (五行) were completed.
Among the myriad things generated and transformed, only humans obtain the refined essence (*chŏng*, 精); things obtain the coarse (*cho*, 粗). There are many types of refined essence, and also many types of coarseness; thus, the number of humans and things is uncountable. The *li* by which the Two *Qi* and Five Phases are generated exists prefiguratively within the Supreme Ultimate. The Supreme Ultimate exists above Yin and Yang, and also above the Five Phases. When this Yin and Yang, Five Phases, and Supreme Ultimate combine and transform to generate things, it is said that only the Supreme Ultimate becomes their nature (*sŏng*, 性). Chu Hsi also believed in emergence through the transformation of *qi* (*kihwa*, 氣化), saying, "Transformation by *qi* means a person is generated just like that, born without seeds from parents. Generation by form (*hyŏngsaeng*, 形生) means this person exists, and then later [offspring] are born." He believed that transformation by *qi* from the Two [Qi] and Five [Phases] occurred not only in the past but even now, citing lice (虱) as an example.

Theory of Heaven and Earth
Heaven is the light and clear aspect of *qi*; Earth is the heavy and turbid aspect of *qi*. Heaven travels over 900,000 *li* (里) in one day and night, moving quite rapidly. Earth is made by the Yin *qi* and Yang *qi*, resulting from the movement and stillness of the Supreme Ultimate.

Theory of Myriad Things = Chu Hsi stated that the interval of the universe is entirely contraction and expansion, coming and going (屈伸往來). In his explanation, he said, "In Heaven and Earth, there is no principle of two standing simultaneously. If Yin does not overcome Yang, then Yang overcomes Yin. There is nothing for which this is not so, no time when this is not so. Cold and heat, day and night, the superior man and the petty man, the principle of Heaven and human desires – all are like this." Therefore, the ascent and descent of this *qi* in the interval of Heaven and Earth divides into six layers (六層). That is, starting from the winter solstice in the 11th month, it rises from the lowest first layer, gradually reaches the top of the sixth layer, arriving at the zenith of Heaven; this occurs in the 4th month. Thus, after Yang has arisen and become sufficient, it diminishes again, and the descending *qi*, namely Yin *qi*, begins to arise. This is said to be the ceaseless ascent, descent, and circulation of this single *qi*, coming and going within the six layers.
His view concerning ghosts and spirits (*kwisin*, 鬼神) is also revealed in the Heng-ch'ü chapter (橫渠篇, referring to Chang Tsai): "The sprouting and growth of plants and trees is *shen* (神, spirit); their wilting, decline, and fall is *kuei* (鬼, ghost). A person going from youth to maturity is *shen*; decline and old age is *kuei*. Exhalation from the nose is *shen*; inhalation is *kuei*. Contraction and expansion, coming and going – this is the natural characteristic of the two *qi* of Yin and Yang. *Qi* that is coming forth belongs entirely to Yang and is also *shen*; returning belongs to Yin and is also *kuei*. Noon belongs to *shen*; afternoon belongs to *kuei*. <49> The creation and transformation of Heaven and Earth are entirely ghosts and spirits."
Therefore, Chu Hsi, based on the idea that the universe is entirely one *qi*, also believed in the sympathetic response (感動) of the human mind, saying, "Fathers and ancestors are all one *qi*. If one is utterly sincere and reverent, there will naturally be sympathetic connection (感通)." He agreed with Hsieh Shang-ts'ai's (謝上蔡) statement that "The spiritual essence (精神) of ancestors is precisely one's own spiritual essence."

Conclusion on the Theory of Heaven, Earth, and Myriad Things
The various theories above were not necessarily originated by Chu Hsi, but they show, on the one hand, the miscellaneous nature of his knowledge, and on the other, the extent to which he applied the *li-qi* dualism. Chu Hsi advocated the Way of the two *qi*, Yin and Yang, in the universe, but *li* and *qi* truly embody the Supreme Ultimate. Therefore, he said, "The Supreme Ultimate is spoken of not apart from Yin and Yang, yet also spoken of not apart from Yin and Yang." However, *qi* gathers to form shapes and disperses to lose shapes. The Supreme Ultimate is sometimes visible, sometimes not, exactly like the moon's reflection seen in a basin of water. If the basin of water is removed, the moon's reflection disappears; if restored, it is seen. The moon's reflection is like the Supreme Ultimate, and the removal and restoration of the basin of water are like the dispersal and gathering of *qi*.

Theory of Nature and Mind (*Sŏngsimnon*, 性心論)

Nature (*Sŏng*, 性)
Humans and things are formed from the two, *li* and *qi*. *Li* is the Supreme Ultimate, and the Supreme Ultimate is nature (*sŏng*). What humans and things receive in common is called the original nature (*pon'yŏn chi sŏng*, 本然之性).
Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom (仁義禮智), etc. – the general principles that make all human relationships fulfilled and smooth are all completely equipped here. This is the original nature, [distinct from] the nature of physical substance (*kijil chi sŏng*, 氣質性). The nature of physical substance depends on the clarity or turbidity of the *qi*. Those with clear *qi* become sages and worthies; those with turbid *qi* become dull and foolish. To explain in detail: one who receives much Wood *qi* often has much commiseration (惻隱之心), while at the same time the sense of shame and dislike (羞惡之心), deference and compliance (辭遜之心), and right and wrong (是非之心) are obstructed by it and cannot be expressed. One who receives much Metal *qi* often has much sense of shame and dislike, while at the same time commiseration, deference and compliance, and right and wrong are obstructed by it and cannot be expressed. Fire and Water are also similar. Therefore, a person whose nature of physical substance is complete combines the virtues of Yin and Yang, and the Five Natures (*osŏng*, 五性 corresponding to Five Phases) are fully prepared. Thus, the nature of physical substance arises after the physical form exists.
However, without physical substance (*hyŏngjil*, 形質), the original nature also has no place to situate itself and act. It is like a ladleful of water, which, without a vessel to contain it, ultimately has nowhere to settle. Therefore, the original nature, in actuality, is intimately connected with the nature of physical substance. Because of this, when discussing the nature of physical substance, one cannot help but speak of both *li* and *qi* together.

Mind (*Sim*, 心)
The mind is the master of the whole person, embodying manifold principles (*chungni*, 衆理) and responding to myriad affairs (*mansa*, 萬事). To which of the two, *li* or *qi*, does it belong? It must belong to *qi*. Thus, it is said, "The mind is the clear and limpid aspect of *qi*." And what relation does it have to nature (*sŏng*)? Nature is the <50> *li* that the mind embodies. Thus, it is said, "Nature is the *li* which the mind embodies (性者, 心之所具之理)," and also, "The mind takes nature as its substance (心以性爲體)." The relationship between nature and mind is clear at this point. Therefore, the mind can be stimulated by *li*, and also stimulated by *qi*. The former is called the Mind of the Way (*tosim*, 道心), and the latter is called the Human Mind (*insim*, 人心). Minds of commiseration, shame and dislike, etc., are all the Mind of the Way. That which arises motivated by experiential things, such as desires (*siyok*, 嗜慾), is the Human Mind. Thus, it is said, "The Mind of the Way arises from moral principle (義理). The Human Mind arises from the human body (人身). Even a sage cannot be without the Human Mind; things like hunger and eating, thirst and drinking, are examples. Even a petty person cannot be without the Mind of the Way; the mind of commiseration and shame and dislike are examples."
As long as this body exists, that is, as long as humans live in the experiential world, even a sage cannot possibly be without desires. At this point, we cannot help but compare this to Kant (칸도). In Mr. Kant's ethics, he says, "Humanity possesses two aspects: phenomenal and noumenal (實在). From the noumenal aspect, the supreme command stimulates our will, and from the experiential aspect, experiential motives govern our will, therefore our actions cannot emerge onto the correct path of ethics." Therefore, Kant is one who fully adheres to the theory of innate goodness (*sŏngsŏnsŏl*, 性善說). His designation of the supreme command as a priori (先天的) is strikingly similar to the Song Confucian theory that nature (*sŏng*) is universal *li*.
As such, since the mind is governed by experiential motives, if left to itself, it suddenly disrupts social order and consequently causes insecurity in human life. This is what the Sage's teaching refers to when it says the Human Mind is precarious (人心惟危). The teaching is to have the Mind of the Way be the master, and make the Human Mind submit to its commands.

Mind, Nature, Feelings (*Sim, Sŏng, Chŏng* 心, 性, 情)
Chu Hsi's view concerning feelings (*chŏng*, 情) has aspects quite worth observing. He believed that "Feelings are what arises when nature (*sŏng*) activates through *qi*; the mind (*sim*) integrates nature and feelings. Therefore, viewed from the aspect of nature, the mind is still and unmoving; viewed from the aspect of feelings, it is stimulated and then connects." He also said, "When the mind is not yet moved, it is nature; when the mind is already moved, it is feelings. That the mind integrates nature and feelings refers to this. Desire (*yok*, 欲) arises from feelings."

Theory of Cultivation (*Kongburon*, 工夫論)

Investigating Things and Exhausting Principle (*Kyŏngmul Kungni*, 格物窮理)
Chu Hsi ultimately equates extending knowledge through investigating things (*ch'iji kyŏngmul*, 致知格物) with exhausting principle (*kungni*, 窮理). Therefore, he said, "Investigating things and extending knowledge is exhausting this principle." He further explained the detailed effort of investigating things, saying, "'Extending knowledge' and 'investigating things' are just one matter. When one investigates things, one extends knowledge. Where ordinary people enter into virtue depends entirely on investigating things and extending knowledge." Chu Hsi explained meticulous reading, saying, "The method of reading lies in proceeding sequentially and advancing gradually, reading thoroughly and thinking intently. For each character, seek its meaning; for each phrase, search out its purport. <51> If you haven't understood what came before, don't dare seek what comes after. If you haven't grasped this passage, don't dare aim for that one. First, you must read it thoroughly until its words seem to come from your own mouth. Then follow with intense thought, so its meaning seems to arise from your own mind." Saying that reading is the primary way to exhaust principle is the unique focus of the Chu Hsi school.
Preserving the Night *Qi* (*Yagi*, 夜氣): Night *qi* refers to the state where selfish thoughts are temporarily quieted and the good conscience is dimly present. What one has understood and gained during the day must be nurtured at night. If one advances one part in understanding principle during the day, the night *qi* increases by one part. If one does this again the next day, advancing day by day and nurturing night by night, the *qi* will become increasingly vast and expansive (*ho'yŏn*, 浩然). If, contrary to this, the night *qi* is diminished day by day, one will eventually not be far from the animals.

Quiet Sitting (*Chŏngjwa*, 靜坐)
Chu Hsi also taught scholars through quiet sitting. In his explanation, he said, "Quiet sitting is not like Zen meditation (坐禪) or entering samadhi (入定), cutting off all thoughts. It is just gathering this mind and not letting it run wild in thoughts. When doing so, the mind becomes tranquil and unoccupied, naturally becoming focused. When affairs arise, respond to each affair accordingly. When the affair is finished, the mind will again become tranquil."
He also showed the importance of a focused mind, saying, "When the mind has something to apply itself to, the mind remains focused on its object. Just look now: as soon as you read a book, focus on reading the book; as soon as you write characters, the mind focuses on writing characters. If you are drifting and distracted, how few will not fall into heterodoxy and depravity!" This is a warning that when facing any task, one must pour one's mind only into that task and not let it wander to other things.

Concluding Remarks on the Theory of Cultivation
The flaw of ordinary people lies in restless agitation (*chodong*, 躁動). Therefore, the spirit of cultivation (*kongbu*, 工夫) is primarily about suppressing and overcoming this restless agitation. From this point, the necessity of quiet sitting arises. However, those whose physical substance (*kijil*) is dull and obstructed do not know righteousness and principle from birth; they see the use of investigating things and exhausting principle (*kyŏngmul kungni*) and merely investigate things and exhaust principle, but without internalizing it themselves (*ch'e'in*, 體認), they are not seeking the Way of the sages and worthies. So-called internalization means preserving the night *qi*. In this sense, preserving the night *qi* is most indispensable. From the three sections above, the main outline of Chu Hsi's cultivation of the mind can be grasped.

Conclusion
In essence, Chu Hsi's establishment of the Supreme Ultimate, i.e., *li*, and *qi* as a dualism to interpret the entirety of the whole universe represents a most distinctively brilliant structure in the history of Chinese philosophical thought. The materials incorporated into it include all phenomena – infantile, strange, true, false – and all learning since the dawn of time, forming the body of its structure. Although occasional flaws are revealed from time to time, viewed as a whole, it can be called complete. Things directly effective from his Song dynasty predecessors <52> are, first, taking the concept of mind (*sim*, 心), which was unclear in I-ch'uan, and assigning it to *qi*, one of the two elements; second, achieving a quite appropriate theory of feelings (*chŏng*) and nature (*sŏng*). Therefore, Chu Hsi must be called the great success of Song dynasty philosophy.
Regarding Chu Hsi's historical position, the most noteworthy point lies in the concept of *li* and *qi*. This concept has undergone three stages of change from Ming-tao (明道, Ch'eng Hao) to the present day. Ming-tao could not yet distinguish *li* and *qi* and interpreted nature (*sŏng*) as *qi*. Chu Hsi clearly distinguished *li* and *qi* and attached nature, as conceived by Ming-tao, to *li*. Because of this, *li* inevitably took on a meaning of reality (實在的 意味).
However, in later generations, discussions started from Chu Hsi's *li* and *qi*, consequently attempting to treat *li* formally and distinguish it from *qi*. Therefore, we [Koreans? East Asians?] did not seek the meaning of the character *li* subjectively. We gentlemen need to ascertain the meaning attached to this.
While the two concepts *li* and *qi* indeed became a cause that stimulated later philosophical thought, beyond that, Chu Hsi's philosophy could not avoid having aspects that awaited supplementation by later people, namely:
1. The arrangement of feelings (*chŏng*).
2. The goodness of the Seven Feelings (七情: joy 喜, anger 怒, sorrow 哀, pleasure 樂, love 愛, hate 惡, desire 欲). This must be called a weak point of Chu Hsi's philosophy, somehow. Therefore, the one who supplemented the first weak point was Chu Hsi's disciple, Ch'en Pei-hsi (陳北溪), and the one who supplemented the second weak point was our Chosŏn's Yi T'oegye (李退溪).
Chu Hsi's successor, Hui-an (晦菴, Chu Hsi himself is often called this), was the great master of philosophy for an era. There were no scholars who did not take him as a teacher. Those who reached his gate numbered several hundred, among whom the famous included Ts'ai Yüan-ting (蔡元定, Ch'ae Wŏnjŏng 蔡元定), Huang Kan (黃榦, Hwang Kan 黃翰), Ch'en Pei-hsi (陳北溪, Chin Puk-kye 陳北溪), P'u Kuang (輔廣, Po Kwang 輔廣), and their followers.

Ch'en Pei-hsi (陳北溪)

Ch'en Pei-hsi's given name was Ch'un (淳) and his courtesy name was An-ch'ing (安卿); he was from Lung-hsi (龍溪). He had been studying for the civil service examinations, but later, when he met Chu Hsi, Chu Hsi saw him and cherished him. Pei-hsi also initially entered Buddhism but returned to Confucianism, deeply admiring the sequence of its attainment. At age 65, his writings include only *Tao-hsüeh t'i-t'ung ssu-p'ien* (道學體統四篇, Four Essays on the System of the Learning of the Way), *Ssu-tao ssu-hsüeh* (似道似學, Resembling the Way, Resembling Learning), etc.

Doctrine
1. Mind Unites *Li* and *Qi* (*Sim Ho Hapsaek Ki*, 心合理氣). Chu Hsi assigned the mind to *qi* and stated it embodied *li*. However, Pei-hsi did not regard the mind as a single entity but rather as a special spiritual entity existing between Heaven and Earth. Therefore, he said, "Only the mind has no opposite (唯心無對)." He also said, "Generally, humans obtain the *li* of Heaven and Earth, which becomes their nature (*sŏng*), and obtain the *qi* of Heaven and Earth, which becomes their body (*ch'e*, 體)." Then he continued, saying, "*Li* and *qi* unite, only then forming a mind (理與氣合, 方成個心)." <53> At this point, the conception of the mind as an entity becomes extremely clear. However, he stated, "The reason the mind has activity is because *qi* exists."
2. Feelings Have Good and Evil (*Chŏng Yu Sŏn Ak*, 情有善惡). Feelings, as Chu Hsi said, come forth from nature (*sŏng*). His explanation says, "Within nature is benevolence (仁); when activated, it emerges as commiseration (惻隱). Within nature is righteousness (義); when activated, it emerges as shame and dislike (羞惡). Within nature are propriety and wisdom (禮智); when activated, they emerge as deference/compliance and right/wrong (辭讓是非)."
This means that feelings include those that issue from nature and those that are obstructed [or deviate?]. This clarifies a point Chu Hsi intended to speak on but ultimately did not articulate.
3. Original Substance of the Supreme Ultimate (*T'aegŭk chi Ponch'e*, 太極의 本體). "The original substance of the Supreme Ultimate is round (圓); it exists in each thing, without the slightest deficiency." This is exactly like what Ch'en Chi-sou (陳幾叟) said: "The moon falls on ten thousand streams; everywhere it is round (月落萬川, 處處皆圓)." The Supreme Ultimate is the general controller (總腦) of the myriad principles (*manli*, 萬理). Therefore, it is difficult not to call the mind also the Supreme Ultimate.

**Summary**

This article by Kang Ch'un-san provides a detailed exposition of the Neo-Confucian philosopher Chu Hsi's system, focusing on his core concepts of *li* (principle) and *qi* (vital force). It outlines Chu Hsi's cosmology, his theories on human nature (*sŏng*), the mind (*sim*), feelings (*chŏng*), and his methods for self-cultivation (*kongbu*), including investigating things (*kyŏngmul*), exhausting principle (*kungni*), preserving the "night *qi*" (*yagi*), and quiet sitting (*chŏngjwa*). The article concludes by briefly introducing Chu Hsi's disciple Ch'en Pei-hsi and his modifications to Chu Hsi's thought, particularly regarding the nature of the mind and feelings. From a colonial history perspective, this 1921 article's deep dive into traditional Chinese/East Asian philosophy, including comparisons to Western thinkers like Kant and noting Korean contributions (Yi T'oegye), is significant. It reflects an engagement with and reassertion of East Asian intellectual heritage during a period of intense Westernization and Japanese colonial rule, potentially serving as a source for exploring Korean intellectual identity formation and the complex interplay between tradition and modernity in the early 20th century.

朱子-哲學...理氣=理의 統一=氣의 殊別...自然哲學...天地萬物 發生=性, 心, 情
陳北溪-學說...心合理氣=情有善惡=太極의 本體

南宋哲學
*預章, 李延平의 時에 宋의 社稷은 漸漸 夷狄의 鞭을 蒙하야 建炎 元年(西紀 227年) 高宗이 位를 南京에 卽하니 於是에 南宋이라 號하니라.

朱學...朱子(傳幷書)

朱晦菴의 名은 熹요 字는 元晦니 嶶州人이라. 父의 名은 松이오 字는 喬年이니 李延平과 同히 羅預章에게 學하다. 進士에 擧하야 官에 就하엿으나 金國과의 和議를 不贊하고 畢竟 宰相秦檜의 旨에 忤하야 建炎4년에 官이 罷하고 友溪城外*秀峯下에 寓하엿다가 其年 9월에 1人의 男子를 生하니 즉 晦菴이라. 幼時부터 顯悟하야 羣兒와 異하더니 4歲時에 其父-天을 指하야 其 天됨을 敎하니 忽然間 曰 「天의 上에 更히 何物이 有하냐」하엿고 14歲時에 父의 遺命으로 劉致中에게 學하고 24歲時에 李延平에게 從學하니라. 高宗時에 夷狄問題에 上書하야 內로 官相을 斥하고 其 和議의 不可함을 論하니 上이 怒하야 誅코저 하다가 宰相 趙雄이 諫止하니라. 慶元 6月 3日에 疾하야 其 所學을 門人에게 屬하고 翌日에 衣冠을 整하고 枕에 就하야 長逝하니 後에 謚하야 文公이라 하고 理宗時에 大師을 贈하고 信國公을 追封하다. 其 著述한 바- 頗多하야 大學, 中庸의 章句 혹 問, 太極圖解, 通書解易本義, 啓蒙, 蓍卦攻誤, 論語集註, 孟子集註, 詩集傳, 楚辭集, 韓文考異, 論孟集議, 孟子指要, 中庸輯略, 孝經刊誤, 小學, 謝上蔡語錄, 延平問答, 宋名臣言行錄, 程氏外書, 程氏遺書, 家禮, 近思錄, 通鑑綱目, 伊洛淵源錄, 正蒙解 等이 是-니 平生 所作이 凡一百卷, 生徒問答＜46＞ 朱子語錄, 朱子語類 等이니라.

그의 哲學=理氣
朱子는 伊川의 思想을 繼承하야 理氣二字를 主張하고 又 周子의 太極으로써 理라 斷하얏나니 故로 曰『只是一個理而已, 因其極致, 然之以太極』이라 하얏다. 그리하야 太極과 理와는 但히 見하는 點이 異할뿐인 바 萬物의 深底에 積함으로써 見할 時는 太極이라 云하고 理와 氣를 相對하야 見할 時는 理라 云할 뿐이라 하얏다.
朱子-以爲하되 宇宙一切의 現象은 皆是, 理氣의 合成으로부터 成하니라. 人物의 生함도, 반듯이 此 理를 禀賦하야써 其性을 成하고 此 氣를 受得하야써 其形을 成하나니 性과 形은 必然的으로 有한 바-니라. 그러나 理와 氣와는 相離하야 存在한 事-決無하다. 氣가 無할 時는 理도 掛搭할 바-無하고 理가 無하면 氣도 亦是 形을 成하기 不能하나니 故로 氣-無한 理가 無하고 理-無한 氣가 無하니라.
更進하야 理氣의 作用的 區別을 論하면 理는 形以上의 道로써 萬物을 生하는 바 原理오 氣는 形以下의 器로써 理에게 屬率되야 鑄形되는 質料니 氣는 即, 自身의 運動이 無하고 必히 理를 待하야 理의 指向에 由한 后이라야 於是乎 流行함을 得할 뿐이니라.
그럼으로 理와 氣는 時의 先後로써 論키 不可하니라. 朱子는 天地有始說과 太極圖說과를 信함으로써 『天地未生以前은 只是理뿐이라』 云하엿도다. 然이나 卽時語를 繼하야 曰 『理가 有하면 便是天地가 有하다』言하엿나니 其 思想의 明裁는 稍히 闕한 바-有하다 하겟으나 大體-理와 氣와는 時의 先後로써 論키 不可하다는 그 點에 對하얀 稍히 明白하도다.
大抵 理와 氣와는 時의 先後로써 論키는 不可하나 自存的 資格으로써 其의 根本的 됨과 否함은 論할만 하니라. 若此로써 論할 時는 理는 根本的이오 氣는 附隨的이라 謂치 아니치 못할지로다. 故로 或 人이 理와 氣와를 論함에 答하야 曰 『有此理, 便有此氣, 但理是本』이라 하니라.
然이나 理는 別個物로써 存함이 아니오 亦是 氣의 中에 存在할 뿐이로다.
然한대 朱子의 有한 바 理의 觀念은 西洋 近世哲學家의 唱導한 바 實在와 現象과 如한 者-아니오 卽 理氣의 二元이 結合하야 個個의 現象을 成한다 함이니 但 理는 氣에 對하야 自存的 資格에서 根本이 될 것뿐이로다.＜47＞
理의 統一
理는 散하야 萬物에 在하나 然이나 可히 統一될 만한 者-니 此卽 萬物의 一原된 바-니라. 萬物의 殊別한 方面으로부터 觀하면 理가 相同치 아니함은 事實이다. 是故로 理는 一面已라 理를 此 方面으로써 觀할 時에 朱子는 多數의 太極圖目을 付하엿으니 以爲하되 『人人이 一太極이 有하며 物物이 一太極이 有한 바 合하야 言하면 萬物이 一太極에 體統되엿으며 此를 更히 分하야 言하면 一物이 各各 一太極式을 具하엿다』하고 兼하야 萬物의 太極이 原初의 太極과 無異함을 喩하야 曰 『一粒의 粟이 生하야 苗가 되고 苗가 更히 花를 生하고 花가 更히 實을 結하고, 그리하야 實이 熟하면 本形에 還復하야 一穗百粒이 有하되 每粒이 個個完全하도다. 又 這의 百粒을 種할 時는 一粒이 又 각 百粒式을 生하야 其 窮極이 無하되 此亦 本初의 一粒으로부터 分去된 바는 否認할 수 無한 사실이다. 此와 同樣으로 物物이 各各 其 理가 有하나 總是 一理일 것뿐이라』하엿다. 果然하면 太極은 一이오 또 萬인 全知全能의 것이 되지 아님이 不可하도다.
然하면 禽獸草木이 如斯히 甚大한 差別을 有한 者도 亦是 一理가 不無하도다. 故曰 『外而至於人則人之理不外於己也, 遠而至於物則, 物之理, 亦不異於人也, 極其大則天地之運, 古今之變, 不能外也, 盡於小則, 一塵之微一息之頃, 不能遺也, 是乃上帝所降之衷, 烝民所秉之彛, 劉子所謂天地之中, 孔子所謂性與天道, 子思所謂天命之性, 孟子所謂仁義之心, 程子所謂天然自有之中, 張子所謂萬物之一原, 卲子所謂道之形體』라 함이 卽 是로다.
故로 朱子는 共通普遍의 理는 有하나 個特 具體的 卽 一物에만 限한 理는 無함과 如하도다. 此 朱子哲學의 眼目이라 하노라.

氣의 殊別
朱子 曰 『以理言之則, 無不全, 以氣言之則, 不能無偏』이라 하나니 理에는 差別이 無하나 氣는 種種의 別이 有하다. 淸爽한 者, 混濁한 者-有하야 一一히 枚擧키 不能하니 此卽 萬物의 差別이 有한 所以로다. 然하나 一一히 太極을 有치 안은 事-無하야 其狀이 寶珠가 水中에 在함과 恰然하도다. 聖賢의 中에 在함은 淸水中에 在함과 如하야 其 淸光이 自然 發揮하며 至愚不肖의 中에 在함은 濁水中에 在함과 如하야 泥濘을 澄去치 안으면 其光을 見키 不能하니라.
此-單히 同一人類에서만 云함이 아니오 人과 物과의 差別도 亦是 氣의 差別뿐이다. 故로 曰 『得其精英者, 爲人得其渣滓者爲物, 初不道付全氣與人, 減下一等與物也,＜48＞但禀受其所得, 物固昏塞矣而, 昏塞之中, 亦有輕重이니 此卽 人物의 差異로다.

自然哲學

天地萬物發生論?
太極은 天地萬物을 發生케 한 바의 原理-니 太初는 渾沌 無差別의 一元氣로써 動하얀 陽을 生하고 靜하얀 陰을 生하며 後에 水火를 生하고 又 木金土가 生하야 於是乎 二氣五行이 具하엿나니라.
然한데 萬物로써 生하고써 化하야 其精을 得한 者는 오즉 人이오 其粗를 得한 者는 卽 物이니 精에 亦 種類가 多하고 粗에도 亦 種類가 多하야 此로써 人物의 數-勝키 不可하니라. 二氣五行이 生하는 바 理는 豫想的으로 太極의 中에 存在하나니 太極은 陰陽의 上에도 存在하고 又 五行의 上에도 存在하니라. 此 陰陽과 五行과 太極이 化合하야 物을 生할 새 其性이 되는 者는, 오즉 太極뿐이라 한다. 朱子는 又 氣化의 出來를 得한다고 信하엿나니 曰 『氣化是當生一個人, 無種自生來底, 形生却是有此人, 後生來』라고 한 바 獨히 過去에 對할 뿐만 아니라 現今이라도 二五로부터 氣化한다고 信하니 虱과 如함이 卽 是라 하니라.

天地論
天은 氣의 輕淸한 者-오 地는 氣의 重濁한 者-니 天이 一晝夜에 大凡 90餘萬里를 行하는 바 頗히 迅速함으로써 地는 是 陰氣와 陽氣로서 即 太極의 動靜에 由하야 作한 바니라.
萬物論=朱子는 宇宙의 中間을 總是 屈伸往來라 하엿나니 其說에 曰 『天地間, 無兩立之理, 非陰勝陽則, 陽勝陰, 無物不然, 無時不然, 寒暑晝夜, 君子小人, 天理人欲皆然』하는도다. 然함으로 天地의 中間에 此氣의 升降上下함이 分하야 六層을 成하엿나니 卽 11월 冬至에 下面 第一層으로부터 生起하야 漸次 第六層의 上에 到하엿다가 極天에 至하나니 是-4月이 되는 것이다. 如是히 陽이 生하엿다가 旣足하면 更히 消却하고 下氣卽陰氣가 便生하나니 此卽這個一氣의 升降循環不已로 六層의 中間에 往來한다 하니라.
鬼神에 關한 見解도 橫渠篇에 露出하엿나니 曰 『草木發生은 卽 神이오 凋殘衰落함은 卽 鬼니라. 人이 少에서 壯에 至함은 卽 神이오 衰老는 卽 鬼-며 鼻息의 呼는 卽 神이오 吸은 卽 鬼-며 屈伸往來는 是-陰陽二氣의 自然性이니 氣方來는 皆陽에 屬하고 兼하야 神이며 反함은 是-陰에 屬하고 兼하야 鬼-며 日午는 神으로 午后는 鬼에 屬하나니＜49＞天地造化-皆是鬼神뿐이라』하니라.
然함으로 朱子는 又 宇宙間은 總是 一氣되는 事를 基礎로 하야 人心의 感動을 信하엿나니 曰 『父祖-皆是一氣라 其誠敬을 極하면 自然 感通한다』하야 謝上蔡의 說에 『祖考精神이 便是自家精神이라』함을 贊同하엿나니라.
天地萬物論의 結論
以上 諸說은 반듯이 朱子의 創唱한 바-아니라 但 一方으로는 其知識의 雜駁을 示하고 又 一方으로는 理氣二元을 如何한 點까지 應用함을 見할 뿐이다. 朱子는 宇宙에 陰陽二氣의 道를 主張하엿스나 理氣는 實로 太極을 具備하니라. 故로 曰 『太極者, 不離陰陽而爲言, 亦不離陰陽而爲言』이라 하다. 然한데 氣가 聚하야 形을 成하고 散하야 形을 失하니라. 太極은 或 見하며 或 不見하나니 恰然히 月影이 盆水에 映함과 如하야 盆水를 除하면 月影을 消失하고 復하면 則見하나니 月影은 太極과 如하고 盆水의 除復은 氣의 散聚함과 如하니라.

性心論
性
人物이 理氣의 二로부터 成하나니 理는 即 太極으로, 太極은 即 性이니라. 人物의 同得한 바 此를 本然이라 한다.
仁義禮智 等, 人生의 모든 關係를 圓滿麗滑케 하는 바 總法則이 此에 具備치 안임이 無하니 此는 本然의 性으로써 氣質性이 有함이로다. 氣質性이라 함은 氣의 淸濁 如何에 準하는 者임으로써 淸한 者는 聖賢이 되며 濁한 者는 昏愚가 되나니라. 詳言하면 木氣를 多得한 者는 惻隱의 心이 常多함과 同時에 羞惡의 心과 辭遜是非의 心이 此에게 窒塞되야 發함을 不得하고 金氣를 多得한 者는 羞惡의 心이 常多함과 同時에 惻隱, 羞惡, 辭遜의 心이 此에게 窒塞되야 發함을 不得하고 火水도 亦然하나니 故로 氣質의 性이 完全한 人은 陰陽의 德을 合하고 五性이 全備하니라. 然則 氣質의 性은 形體가 有한 후에 生하는도다.
然하나 形質이 無하면 本然의 性도 自己를 安置云爲할 바가 無할지로다. 一勺의 水도 此를 盛할 器가 無하면 畢竟 歸着할 바가 無함과 如하니라. 故로 本然의 性은 實際에 在하야는 氣質의 性과 密接하나니 此로써 氣質의 性을 論할 時는 어찌할 수 업시 理와 氣를 幷言치 아니치 못할지로다.

心
心은 一身의 主宰로 衆理를 具하야 萬事에 應하는 바-니 此가 理氣 兩者중 何者에 屬하엿는가. 此는 氣에 屬치 안음을 不得하리로다. 乃曰 『心者, 氣之淸爽者』-며 又 其性에 如何한 關係를 有하엿는가? 性은 心을 具하는 바＜50＞理니라. 乃曰 『性者, 心之所具之理』라 하고 又曰 『心以性爲體』라 하엿나니 性과 心의 關係-此点에서 明白하니라. 故로 心은 理에 因하야 剌動되며 又 氣에 因하야 剌動될만 하나니 前者는 此를 道心이라 하고 後者는 此를 人心이라 한다. 惻隱羞惡 等의 心은 皆道心이오 經驗的 事物을 動機로 하야 發한 者 卽 嗜慾과 如함은 是人心이니라. 乃曰 『道心是義理上發出來底, 人心是人身上發出來底, 然之而雖聖人, 不能無人心, 饑食渴飮之類是也, 雖小人不能無道心, 如惻隱羞惡之心是也』-로다.
此 身體가 有한 以上, 即 經驗世界에 人間의 生住하는 以上은 비록 聖人이라도, 어찌할 수 업시 嗜欲이 無키 不能하도다. 吾人은 此에 至하야 勢-此를 『칸도』에 比치 아니치 못할지니 『칸도』氏의 倫理學에 曰 『人類는 現象, 實在의 二方面을 有하나니 實在的 方面으로부터 無上의 命令이 吾人의 意志를 剌動하고 經驗的 方面으로부터 經驗的 動機가 吾人의 意志를 司配하는 故로 其行이 倫理의 正路에 出치 못한다』하엿나니라. 然함으로 『칸도』는 完然是性善說을 執한 者-라 其 無上命令으로써 先天的이라 한 者는 即 性은 普偏的 理라 한 宋儒의 說과 酷似하도다.
斯와 如히 心은 經驗的 動機에 由하야 司配된 者임으로 그대로 放任할 時는 忽然히 社會의 秩序를 紊亂케 하며, 딸아서 人生의 安危를 生케 하나니, 此-即 聖人의 敎에 人心은 惟危라 云한 바 其敎-道心으로써 主宰케 하고 人心으로써 其 命令에 屈케 함이로다.

心, 性, 情
朱子의 情에 關한 見解-頗히 可觀할 만한 者-有하니 以爲하되 『情은 性이 氣를 통하야 發動하는 바-요 心은 性情을 統하는 者-라. 故로 性의 方面으로 見하면 心은 寂然하야 不動하고 情의 方面으로 見하면 感하야 遂通하는 者라』 하며 又曰 『心이 動치 안을 時는 性이오 心이 已動할 時는 卽 情이니 心이 性情을 統하엿다 함은 此를 謂함이로다. 欲은 是情으로부터 發生한 者라』 하니라.

工夫論

格格物窮理
致知格物과 窮理와는 朱子는 畢竟 此를 同一에 歸케 하니 故로 曰 『格物致知, 是窮此理』라 하고 更히 格物의 精細한 工夫를 說하야 曰 『致知格物은 只是一事니라. 物을 致하는 時는 卽 知를 致함이니 凡人의 德이 入하는 處- 全혀 格物致知에 在하다』하니라. 朱子 精密한 讀書를 說하야 曰 『讀書之法在循序而漸進, 熱讀而精思, 字求其訓, 句索其旨,＜51＞未得於前則, 不敢求於後, 未通於此則, 不敢志乎彼, 先須熟讀使其言, 皆若出於吾之口, 繼以精思, 使其意, 若出於吾心』이라 하엿스니 是-讀書로써 窮理의 第一이라 함은 朱子派의 唯一眼目이라 할지라.
夜氣를 存함 : 夜氣라 함은 私心이 暫靜하고 良心朦朧의 狀이니 一晝의 間에 理會하야 得한 바를 夜에 入하야 須히 涵養할지라. 日間에 一分의 道理를 進得하야 夜氣-便一分을 添하고 第二日에 更히 如斯하야 日日只管進하고 夜間只管進하면 氣가 益浩然하나리라. 若此에 反하야 夜氣를 日日減耗하면 遂禽獸에 不遠하나리라.

靜坐
朱子는 又 學者에게 敎함에 靜坐로써 하엿나니 其說에 曰 『靜坐는 是坐禪入定과 如히 思慮를 一切斷함이 아니오 只此心를 收斂하야 思慮에 走케 아니할 뿐이다. 然할 時는 心이 湛然無事하야 自然히 專一할지며 其有事에 及하야 隨事應事하고 事를 已할 時는 後湛然할지니라.
彼又 熱心의 要를 示하야 曰 『心有所用則心存所主, 只看如今纔讀書, 便主於讀書, 纔寫字, 則心便主於寫字, 若是悠悠蕩蕩, 幾有不入於邪僻者也』-라 하니 此는 凡事에 當하야 모롬직이 其心을 其事에만 傾注하고 他事에 及치 勿하라 하는 誡意니라.

工夫論의 結言
凡人의 弊는 躁動에 在하니라. 故로 工夫의 精神은 先히 此 躁動을 鎭克함으로써 第一이라 할지니 此点에서 靜坐의 必要가 有하다 한다. 然한데 氣質의 昏塞한 者는 生하야 義理를 不知하나니 格物窮理의 用을 見하고 徒히 格物窮理할 뿐으로써 自家의 體認한 事-無하면 聖賢의 道를 求하는 바가 아니로다. 所謂 體認은 문득 夜氣를 存케 함이니 此意味로써 夜氣를 存하는 바가 最不可闕의 者-라. 以上 三段에서 朱子가 修心工夫의 大綱은 此를 盡함을 得하엿도다.

結論
要컨대 朱子가 太極 卽 理와 氣와를 二元으로 立하야써 全宇宙의 全體를 解釋함은 中國哲學思想에서 最히 異彩를 放한 一組織이라 할지니 其材料로 入來한 者는 開闢이래의 幼, 怪, 眞, 僞의 一切 現象과 一切 學術로써 其組織의 體를 作한 바 時로 혹 破綻의 露가 無함은 아니로되 大軆로써 보면 完全타 할지로다. 其의 直接으로 宋代의 先輩 諸氏에게＜52＞ 有効타 할 것은 第一 伊川에서 不明하엿든 心字를 取하야 此에 二元의 一되는 氣에 屬케 한 事-며 第二 情性의 說이 頗히 正當함을 得한 事-是-니라. 故로 朱子로써 宋代哲學의 大成功者-라  謂치 아니치 못하겟도다.
朱子의 歷史的 位置에 對하야 가장 注意할 만한 바 者는 卽 理氣의 觀念에 在하나니 此觀念은 明道以來로 今日에 至하기까지 凡三段의 變遷이 有하엿도다. 明道는 아즉 理氣를 分別치 못하야 性은 卽 氣라 解하엿고 朱子는 理氣를 잘 區別하야 理에 附함을 明道의 唱想한 性으로써 하니라. 此로써 理는 實在的 意味를 帶치 아니함이 不可하도다.
然한데 後世에 降하야는 朱子의 理氣를 起点으로 하고 論한 故로 理를 形式的으로 하야 此를 氣로부터 區別코저 하엿도다. 然함으로 吾人은 理字의 意味를 主觀的으로 求치 안하엿으니 우리 諸位는 此에 附한 意味의 如何를 査定할 必要가 有하다 하노라.
理氣의 二字는 果然 後來의 哲學思想을 惹起한 바의 一原因이 되엇스나 又 其外에 朱子哲學은 後人의 補成을 待할 者-有함을 免치 못하나니 卽
一. 情의 配列
二. 七情의 善(喜, 怒, 哀, 樂, 愛, 惡, 欲)이니 此는 如何튼지 朱子哲學의 弱点이라 하겟도다. 그러함으로 第二의 弱点을 補成한 者는 朱子의 門人, 陳北溪-며 第二의 弱点을 補한 者는 卽 此를 우리 朝鮮의 李退溪-라 할지로다.
朱子의 後繼 晦菴은 一世哲學의 泰斗라. 學者-此를 師치 안임이 無하다. 其門人에 及한 者-數百人에 達한 바 其中 有名한 者를 數하면 蔡天定, 黃翰, 陳北溪, 補廣의 徒-是로다.

陳北溪陳

陳北溪의 名은 淳이오 字는 安卿이니 龍溪人이라. 科擧의 業을 習하다가 後에 朱子에게 謁한대 朱子-見하고 鍾愛하다. 北溪도 初에 佛敎에 入하엿다가 儒에 歸하야 其上達의 次第를 甚히 嘆服하니라. 年 65에 그의 著한 바는 唯道學體統四篇, 似道似學等이 有하니라.

學說
一. 心合理氣 朱子는 心으로써 氣에 屬케 하고 理를 具備하다 하엿스나 然이나 北溪는 心으로써 一物로 看做치 아니하고 寧히 天地間에 在하야 特別의 靈的 物이라 하엿도다. 故로 曰 『唯心無對』라 하고 又曰 『大抵人得天地之理, 爲性, 得天地之氣, 爲體』라 하며 乃繼 하야 曰 『理與氣合, 方成個心』＜53＞이라 하엿으니 此에 至하야 於是乎心의 其物된 觀念이 至明하도다. 然한데 『心의 活動이 有한 바는 氣가 有한 故라』하다.
二. 情有善惡 情은 朱子의 言과 如히 性으로부터 出來한 者라 하나니 其說에 曰 『性中有仁, 動出爲惻隱, 性中有義, 動出爲羞惡, 性中有禮智, 動出爲辭讓是非』라 하다.
是-情이 性으로부터 發한 者와 遮한 者-有하다 함이니 此卽 朱子의 言코저 하다가 畢竟 發치 못한 處를 發明한 바-로다.
三. 太極의 本體 『太極의 本體는 圓하니 各物에 存在하되 毫末도 缺少한 處-無하다』하니라. 此卽 陳幾叟가 謂한 바 『月落萬川, 處處皆圓』이라 함과 恰如하도다. 太極은 萬理에 總腦되는 바-라. 故로 心도 亦是 太極이라 不謂키 難하다 하니라.
