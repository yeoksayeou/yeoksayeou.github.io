Company Announcement
Especially to the Personnel at Each Regional Distribution Office and to Our Readers

One, Please send the subscription fee for this magazine and postage in advance (for three months, six months, or one year). We cannot send the magazine unless payment is made in advance.

One, When sending money from each parish (各敎區), please send it directly under the name of the Kaebyŏksa (開闢社) account holder for postal transfer account Kyŏngsŏng 8106 (振替口座京城八一○六加入者開闢社 名義). If, by chance, you send it indirectly under the name of the No Hŏnyong (盧憲容) account holder for postal transfer account Kyŏngsŏng 1363 (振替口座京城一三六三加入者盧憲容名義), it may not be processed in time, leading to discrepancies.

One, When sending money via postal transfer, please be sure to clearly write the reason for the remittance—specifically, "X amount of Won and Chŏn for the annual subscription fee and postage for *Kaebyŏk* from issue number X to issue number X"—in the communication section on the back of the postal transfer form. If there is no message in the communication section, it causes great difficulty in processing the money.

One, When communicating with our company, whether by postcard or sealed letter, please be sure to accurately write and send the sender's full name and address (Province, County, Township, House Number). If the address is unclear, there is no way for us to send a reply to your inquiry or send the items you requested.

Kaebyŏksa Accounting Department <54>

**Summary**

This announcement from the Kaebyŏksa (Kaebyŏk Company) Accounting Department outlines strict procedures for subscription payments and communication. It mandates advance payment for the *Kaebyŏk* magazine, specifies the correct postal transfer account (Kyŏngsŏng 8106, Kaebyŏksa) versus an incorrect one (Kyŏngsŏng 1363, No Hŏnyong), and stresses the need for detailed information on transfer forms and accurate return addresses on all correspondence. For historians, this text provides insight into the practical business operations and logistical challenges faced by a prominent Korean cultural magazine during the colonial period, including reliance on the postal transfer system and the importance of precise record-keeping for distribution and financial management. The mention of specific account numbers and names hints at the organizational structure and potential financial complexities.
