The World's First Proponent of the Indestructibility of Matter, Master Sŏ Kyŏng-dŏk: Introduction to Korea's Ten Great Figures, Part One

This journal now dares to begin introducing the Ten Great Figures of Korea's 4,000-year history, based on the votes cast by you, our brothers and sisters. However, there is one thing to mention: even if someone is recognized through votes as a scientist or a politician, we will not primarily focus on introducing their science or politics. Instead, we intend to introduce the person as they were. Depending on the results of this introduction, perhaps your existing thoughts about these great figures might change. Also, according to the order of the vote announcement, Master Yi Hwang (李滉) should have been first, but due to difficulties in collecting materials, we will disregard the era and order and introduce Master Sŏ Kyŏng-dŏk (徐敬德) first. Lastly, we express our gratitude to Mr. Hwang Ŭi-don (黃義敦), who, despite various pressing matters, took up the brush for this introduction... (One Reporter)

I. The Master's Birth and Childhood

The Master's surname was Sŏ (徐), his given name was Kyŏng-dŏk (敬德), his courtesy name was Kagu (可久), and his style name was Pokchae (復齋). His clan origin was Tangsŏng (唐城), and because he lived in seclusion and cultivated himself at Hwadam (花潭) outside the East Gate of Songdo (松都), people referred to him as Master Hwadam (花潭先生). In the 20th year of King Sŏngjong's reign in the Yi Dynasty (己酉 year), 433 years ago from today, corresponding to the Western year 1489, on the 17th day of the 2nd month, Master Hwadam Sŏ, a treasure of Korea, a beautiful flower of the world, a leader in East Asian culture, and a pioneer of Korean thought, carrying the mandate of High Heaven, let out his first cries in a corner of a silent farmhouse in Hwajŏng-ri (禾井里), Songdo, the 500-year cultural capital where Mount Sŏnggŏ (聖居山) stands tall and the waters of Hwagye Stream (花溪水) run clear. The time was during the reign of King Sŏngjong the Great, the second cultural golden age of the Yi Dynasty, 8 years after the birth <85> of the ideal statesman Master Cho Chŏng'am (趙光祖, Cho Kwang-jo), 13 years before the birth of the great thinker Master Yi T'oegye (李滉, Yi Hwang), 48 years before the emergence of the great philosopher Master Yi Yulgok (李珥, Yi I); 25 years after the death of the Chinese philosopher Xue Jingxuan (薛敬軒, Xue Xuan), 11 years before the death of Chen Baisha (陳白沙, Chen Xianzhang), 24 years after the birth of Luo Zheng'an (羅整菴, Luo Qinshun), 17 years after the birth of Wang Yangming (王陽明, Wang Shouren); in Western philosophy, 17 years after the birth of Copernicus (코펠니크쓰), the proponent of the heliocentric theory, 3 years before Columbus's (커롬보쓰) discovery of the New World, and 28 years before Luther's (루텔) declaration of the Reformation. It was an era of pioneering Yi Dynasty culture in Korea, the peak period of Ming Dynasty culture in China, an age of great debate between the two major philosophical schools of Shandong (Shandong; 薛派 Xue school) and Yuyao (Yuyao; 王派 Wang school), and a time when the seeds of the Enlightenment movement were sprouting most vigorously in the West. Ah! Was it Heaven's intention? That the world's scholarly fortune should bloom all at once, and philosophers of East and West should emerge simultaneously, is indeed a rare thing to behold.

The Master's family was a humble local gentry family (hyangsajok, 鄕士夫家) that had resided in P'ungdŏk (豐德) for generations before moving to Songgyŏng (松京, Songdo) following the Master's maternal family. The Master's great-grandfather was Tŭkpu (得富), his grandfather was Sun'gyŏng (順卿), and his father was Hobŏn (好蕃). His mother was from the Han (韓) clan. For generations, they had "accumulated virtue and planted benevolence" (積德種仁), the karmic cause for having such a glorious descendant as the Master. Furthermore, the Master's strict father was known for his prudence and integrity, and his mother for her gentle warmth and affection, earning the reverence of their neighbors. Ah! How could a sweet spring (醴泉) lack a source, and how could a spirit fungus (靈芝) lack roots? No matter how much the Master's innate talent was like that of one "born knowing" (生知), it was under the guidance of his strict father and in the embrace of his affectionate mother that his pure and untainted good nature was nurtured, and his brilliant and perceptive innate talent was brought to fruition.

Thus, by the age of 6 or 7, the Master was already intelligent, outstanding, resolute, upright, readily followed the teachings of elders, and diligently pursued the study of the principles of things (物理硏究). As the Master's family was originally poor as if washed clean (淸貧如洗), when he was 6 or 7, to help with the family's livelihood, he was gathering vegetables in the fields when he observed a ground-nesting bird (從地理鳥) gradually flying higher each day, inch by inch, foot by foot. After pondering deeply in silence for several days, he finally realized the principle that it flew higher day by day following the warming of the earth's energy (地氣). Ah! No matter how young a swift horse (驥馬), it dreams of galloping a thousand leagues, and no matter how small a crane chick (鶴雛), it harmonizes with the cry from the ninth marsh (九臯). The Master's genius, destined to become the pioneering great philosopher of the peninsula, manifested itself in various ways even in his childhood.

At the age of 14, while learning the Book of Documents (尚書) and the three hundred poems (朞 3百篇, likely referring to the Book of Odes) from a village teacher (學究), the teacher could not explain their principles. The Master returned home and, after contemplating deeply for 15 days, finally grasped their structure thoroughly. From then on, he established the confidence to investigate and understand any principle and advanced his steps in research.

II. The Master's Period of Cultivation

Ah! No matter how long our destiny may be, its determination often comes from a momentary <86> profound emotion (感激). Śākyamuni Buddha became the savior of the three realms from the mystical emotion outside the gates of Kapilavastu. Thucydides (듸오시듸우쓰) became a great historian whose fame rivaled the sun and moon from a single tear of emotion while reading history. Wŏnhyo (元曉) became a great figure in the Dharma realm through the emotional impulse from the kōan of mind and phenomena arising and ceasing. Gibbon (끼본) produced a great historical work, indelible for a thousand ages, from a handful of tears shed in nostalgic contemplation amidst the sunset forest of the ancient capital of Rome (로마). The life of the Master, destined to be a beautiful flower in the history of world culture and the crystallization of thought on the peninsula, no matter how much genius he was endowed with, how could it lack an extraordinary emotional impulse?

When the Master was 18 years old, while reading the Great Learning (大學) thoroughly, upon reaching the chapter "Wishing to extend knowledge lies in investigating things" (致知在格物), he sighed deeply and shed tears sorrowfully. In that instant, it felt as if something struck the Master's chest, and something stimulated his nerves. "Ah! How can one be human without realizing the truth of the universe? How can a scholar read texts without investigating it?" he exclaimed. From this point, he roused himself greatly, listed the names of all things in heaven and earth on the wall, and devoted himself daily to investigating them, almost forgetting to eat and sleep. Ah! This was the first path into the Master's life of truth, the initial emotional impulse, from which the Master's long 40-year future path was directed, and from which his indelible great thought, lasting a thousand ages, began to radiate light.

The Master's eyebrows were arched high, his eyes were like the morning star, his intelligence surpassed the ordinary, and his fortitude was extraordinary. With such uncommon innate talent, the Master combined utmost sincerity like "an iron ox on a mosquito" (蚊子上鐵牛) and final, decisive effort like "sinking the boats and breaking the cooking pots" (沉船破釜甑的). From then on, the Master shut his door, sat upright, and devoted himself to contemplation and vigorous inquiry for several decades, often transcending time and space, forgetting sleep and food. Moreover, in the Master's household, destitute as if washed clean (赤貧如洗), there were times when the fire went out for 6 or 7 days. And the Master's spirit, focused on contemplation, even abstained from sleep for over 10 days. But on the Master's face, like a spring breeze and gentle rain (春風和雨), there was not a shadow of darkness, and in his heart, like bright wind and clear moonlight (光風霽月), a path of light shone.

In the eyes of the Master, intoxicated and immersed in the tenacity of truth and the depth of nature, honor and disgrace were utterly forgotten, and wealth and rank were viewed as floating clouds (浮雲視). Therefore, in the 14th year of King Chungjong (the Master's 31st year, 己卯), during Cho Kwang-jo's (趙光祖) reform movement, when the Master was ranked first in the examination for recruiting the wise and virtuous (賢良科), he resolutely declined and refused it.

Because the Master's efforts were excessively harsh, even with his healthy body and strong mind, his vital energy (氣血) eventually stagnated, and his nerves weakened, causing him to fall into hardship and misfortune for a time. Therefore, at the age of 34, to train his body and cultivate his spirit, he set out on a journey to famous mountains and great rivers. Thus, he traveled extensively through famous mountains such as Kŭmgang (金剛), Songni (俗離), and Chiri (智異). As the Master originally loved nature intensely, <87> whenever he encountered famous mountains and scenic spots, unable to contain his great enthusiasm, he would compose poetry, sing, and dance without cease. In his poem about Kŭmgang Mountain, he wrote: "Hearing of Kŭmgang's splendor, I cherished it in vain for twenty years. Now that I've come to this land of clear views, how much more so in this fine autumn season. The stream chrysanthemums' fragrance begins to stir, the cliff maples' red is about to ignite. Chanting as I walk beneath the forest ravine, my heart feels clear and serene." This expresses his admiration for the nature of Kŭmgang. (Other various poems cannot be introduced due to space limitations on the page.)

After traveling for a year, the Master's mental clarity and physical health recovered. He then devoted himself even more intensely to scholarship, advancing to a state of clear realization of truth.

III. The Master's Period of Maturity

At the age of 43, following his mother's command, the Master went to the examination field and passed the Saengwŏn examination (成均生員), but since wealth and rank were not his original aspiration, he did not stain himself again with the red dust (紅塵, worldly affairs). At the age of 56, he received an appointment as Royal Tomb Keeper (參奉) of Hureung (厚陵), but he also firmly declined and did not take office. Finally, amidst the towering green mountains (靑山) and vast green waters (綠水) by the Sŏsa Pavilion (逝斯亭) at Hwadam (花潭), he became a companion to deer (麋鹿) and apes and cranes (猿鶴), dreaming the dream of truth and dancing the dance of nature. He admired ancient figures like Shao Yaofu (邵堯夫, Shao Yong) and Zhang Hengqu (張橫渠, Zhang Zai) and taught later disciples such as Pak Hwa-suk (朴和叔, Pak Sun 朴淳) and Hŏ T'ae-hwi (許太輝, Hŏ Yŏp 許曄).

"Fire out for two days, the sun already past noon, his discussion moves people, his countenance shows no fatigue" (絶火兩日, 日巳亭午, 議論動人, 容無困悴) is the record of Yi Sŏk-tam (李石潭). "Moss covers the cauldron, playing the zither and chanting loftily" (苔滿鼎鐺, 敲琴高咏) is the praise of Hŏ Ch'o-dang (許草堂). "If only I could have met him then, it would surpass reading books for ten years" (當年如得見, 勝讀十年書) is the admiration of Yi T'oegye (李退溪). "Among the three marvels of Songdo, the Master is the foremost" (松都三絶, 先生爲首) is the reverence of Hwang Chin-i (黃眞娘).

(Poems by Sŏ Kyŏng-dŏk):
"Studying books, my ambition was once statecraft,
Yet in late years, I'm content with Yan Hui's poverty.
Wealth and rank involve contention, hard to grasp,
Forests and springs have no restrictions, a place to rest my body.
Gathering from mountains, fishing in waters, enough to fill my belly,
Singing to the moon, chanting in the wind, enough to delight my spirit.
Learning until doubt vanishes is truly joyful,
Avoiding living a hundred years in vain."
(讀書當日志經綸, 歲暮還甘顔氏貧. 富貴有爭難下手, 林泉無禁可安身. 採山釣水堪充腹, 咏月吟風足暢神. 學到不疑眞快活, 免敎虛作百年人.)

"Standing upright in mid-heaven, my body without shame,
My spirit enters the realm of clarity and harmony.
It's not that my heart disdains high office,
My long-held aspiration has always been in forests and springs.
The work of sincerity and enlightenment expands like a well-honed blade,
The profound mechanism is good for applying the whip (urging oneself on),
The effort of maintaining reverence faces the transcendent,
Wind and moon fill the window, naturally serene."
(將身無愧立中天, 興入淸和境界邊. 不是吾心薄卿相, 從來素志在林泉. 誠明事業恢遊刃, 玄妙機關好着鞭, 主敬工夫方對越滿窓風月自悠然.)

These are the Master's own expressions and self-praise. How can this not be a gentlemanly figure who enjoys heaven's will and knows his destiny (樂天知命)? Is it not a self-realization of a view of life centered on peace of mind and establishing one's destiny (安心立命)? Ah! The Master's tranquil and self-possessed demeanor (氣像) and his free, pure, and clear spiritual aura (神韻) alert and warn descendants of a thousand ages.

Is he the high peak of the great snow mountain (大大雪山)? The beautiful flower of the great red lotus (大紅蓮)? The auspicious phoenix (瑞鳳) of the morning sun? The immortal crane (仙鶴) amidst the clouds? With what shall I praise the Master? With what shall I depict the Master? No matter how much I wish to learn, can I learn? No matter how much I wish to name, can I name it?

As the Master's virtue became more rounded and his learning more mature, at the venerable age of 56, he articulated the self-realized truth he had accumulated and stored for several decades, composing 14 pieces including "Fundamental Principles of Li and Qi" (原理氣), "Discourse on Li and Qi" (理氣說), "Discourse on the Great Ultimate" (太極說), and "Discourse on Spirits, Death, and Life" (鬼神死生論), expounding <88> his core ideas of Qi Monism (氣的一元論) and the Indestructibility of Matter (物質不滅論). In works like "Explanation of Sounds" (聲音解), "Explanation of the Numbers of the Supreme Ultimate Governing the Ages" (皇極經世數解), "Explanation of Hexagram Diagrams" (卦圖解), and "Explanation of Hexagram Changes" (卦變解), he followed the traditions of Fu Xi's Yi Jing (羲易) and Shao Yong's learning (邵學), using Numerology (數理學), his unique specialty, to interpret the symbolic numbers (象數) of cosmic change.

Indifferent Heaven (蒼天), not adhering to the principle "The benevolent will surely live long" (仁者必壽), ultimately did not grant the Master longevity. Thus, ending his life at the age of 58, in the first year of King Myŏngjong's reign (丙午), 376 years ago from today (Western year 1546), on the 7th day of the 7th month, he bid farewell to this world with a gentle smile. Ah! "The wise man withers, the great mountain crumbles" (哲人萎矣泰山頹矣). The evening clouds over Mount Sŏnggŏ, having lost their axis, harbor resentment for a thousand ages, and the masterless waves at Hwadam逝波 still sob today. But though the Master has gone, his spirit remains; though his physical life ended in the short span of 58 years, his philosophical thought will be infinite for ten thousand years.

Here ends my description of the Master's apparent life. I now wish to explain the aspect of the Master's thought.

IV. Outline of the Development of Chinese Confucian Thought Before the Master

The Master was, of course, a philosopher and a Confucian scholar (儒家). Among Confucians, he was a profound, sharp, and original philosopher; among philosophers, he was a moderate and steadfast Confucian thinker. To go a step further, Confucianism was his life, and Confucian thought was his lifeblood and brilliance. Whoever wishes to explain the Master's life, that is, the Master's history, cannot help but emphasize the aspect of his thought rather than his actual life. Without it, the Master's light would be absent, and his value could not be found. For a latter-day student like myself (黃口幼兒), a mere fledgling, to presumptuously introduce the Master is certainly daunting. However, having taken up the brush to introduce the Master, I cannot help but focus on the aspect of his thought, specifically his Confucian philosophical concepts. At the same time, I must first describe the historical development of Chinese Confucian thought, which has a significant connection and relation to the Master's thought as its origin and source. Without this, explaining the Master's thought would be difficult. Therefore, I will first outline its general course.

Ethic-centric thought is undoubtedly a characteristic of the Chinese people and the central issue of Chinese thought; moreover, it is the guiding principle and doctrine of Confucianism. Therefore, they sought to resolve all manner of affairs from an ethical standpoint. Politically, they dreamed of an ideal state where "ruler is ruler, minister is minister, father is father, son is son" (君君臣臣父父子子). In worldly conduct, they proclaimed, "Filial piety is the root of all conduct" (孝者百行之源). Philosophically, "human nature is good" (性善) or "human nature is evil" (性惡) was their central point of contention, with "What Heaven confers is called nature" (天命之謂性) being their ultimate culmination and starting point <89> (historically). To put it plainly, in the primitive era of Confucianism, its founder Confucius (仲尼) rather disregarded the ideal aspect and focused exclusively on the practical aspect, that is, practical ethics. Thus, he "seldom spoke of destiny or benevolence" (罕言命與仁), and said, "Not yet knowing life, how can one know death?" (未知生焉知死), "Not yet knowing how to serve humans, how can one know how to serve spirits?" (未知事人焉知事鬼), thereby completely rejecting speculation beyond reality. Therefore, even Zi Gong (子貢), a high disciple of the Sage, lamented, "The Master's words on nature and the Way of Heaven cannot be heard" (夫子之言性與天道不可得而聞). In short, Confucius' assertion was that for us humans engrossed in the reality of life, there is no need to look beyond reality, into the vast realm of ideals.

However, the impulse of our intellectual desire not only refuses to blindly follow beliefs lacking principled explanation, but at that time, the Southern Chinese culture flourishing in the Yangtze River basin—namely, the profound and idealistic doctrines of Laozi, Zhuangzi, Liezi, Yang Zhu (老莊列楊輩)—was sweeping the world. Simultaneously, the vitality of Confucianism, which had a weak idealistic foundation, became precarious. Therefore, to counter this, it became necessary to construct a suitable ethical ideal, that is, Confucian philosophy. Thus, Zi Si (子思) first advocated "What Heaven confers is called nature" (天命之謂性), initiating the beginnings of Confucian philosophy. Mencius (孟子) advocated the theory of "innate goodness" (性善), and Xunzi (荀子) advocated the theory of "innate evil" (性惡), attempting to establish the foundational thought of ethics. However, these were all fragmentary discoveries during the primitive, budding stage of Confucian philosophy, lacking organization, connection, lineage, and unity. Furthermore, during the 1500 years after the Qin and Han dynasties, it was a period of decline and darkness for Confucianism, and there was no one to inherit and develop its thought. Dong Zhongshu's (董氏, 仲舒) theory of the origin of the Way (道原說) tended towards carelessness. Yang Xiong's (楊氏, 雄) Theory of the Great Mystery (太玄論) drifted towards Laozi and Zhuangzi. Wang Tong's (王氏, 通) theory of holding the middle (執中說) remained superficial. There were certainly no idealistic Confucian scholars.

Buddhism, which began to be imported from the Eastern Han period—that is, the profound and mystical thought of India—like a torrential flood, swept with the force of a rapid tide covering a thousand leagues, crossing the Pamir Plateau and rounding Malacca (마라카), engulfing the entire Chinese mainland and trampling upon the previously unsteady foundations of Chinese cultural thought. Consequently, there were movements for the harmony of the three teachings (三敎一致論) by figures like Zhang Rong (張融), Zhou Yong (周顒), and Chen Xiyi (陳希夷輩), attempting to reconcile the two great trends of thought, Chinese and Indian. However, these efforts produced no response, achieved no merit, and ultimately ended in failure.

Then, arriving at the Song dynasty, as a reaction, various philosophers such as Zhou Lianxi (周濂溪, Zhou Dunyi 周敦頤), Shao Kangjie (邵康節, Shao Yong 邵雍), Cheng Mingdao (程明道, Cheng Hao 程顒), Cheng Yichuan (程伊川, Cheng Yi 程頤), and Zhang Hengqu (張橫渠, Zhang Zai 張載) emerged successively. They constructed Confucian thought more systematically, clarified the Confucian standpoint more distinctly to counter Buddhist thought. Furthermore, the great philosophers Zhu Huian (朱晦庵, Zhu Xi 朱熹) and Lu Xiangshan (陸象山, Lu Jiuyuan 陸九淵) arose together and synthesized these developments. As a result, the influence of Confucianism suddenly <90> grew immensely, grasping hegemony in the East Asian intellectual world. Now, I wish to sequentially explain the outline of the thought of the Song Confucians.

Undoubtedly, the main focus of Confucianism is ethics. Therefore, its philosophical thought also departed from an ethical standpoint. Consequently, its result culminated in ontology (本軆論). Of course, it did not even dream of reaching the scope of epistemology or aesthetics. If one speaks of Confucian philosophy, anyone would understand it, without needing to ask, as consisting only of ontology and ethics. Moreover, its content was dogmatic (獨斷論), blindly affirming the reality of the universe and boldly acknowledging our understanding. Compared to 20th-century philosophical trends, its content is admittedly naive and its scope narrow. However, the scope of this essay is not to critique Confucian thought from a modern perspective, but to introduce the historical development of Confucian thought as it is, in order to explore the origins of Master Hwadam's thought. Therefore, regardless of right or wrong, true or false, I intend to introduce only the central issues of Confucian thought—ontology and ethics—as they are. Nay, going a step further, the doctrines of Master Hwadam, the subject of this essay, that have been transmitted to later generations pertain only to a part of ontology within Confucian thought; there are no extant writings of the Master that would allow us to glimpse his ethical thought. As the writer aiming to introduce the Master's unique ontology, I prefer to describe only a part of the ontology within Chinese Confucian thought. Thus, concerning the thought of the Song Confucians—the era of systematic Confucian philosophy I am about to describe—I intend to introduce only a part of their ontology.

Although the thought of the Song Confucians advocated upholding Confucianism and rejecting both Daoism (仙, lit. immortal teachings) and Buddhism (佛), in reality, the influence of Daoist and Buddhist thought was not insignificant. To put it plainly, they absorbed Daoist and Buddhist ideas and systematically organized Confucian philosophy in a way that transformed its appearance while retaining elements of the original substance (換骨脫態的). Therefore, no matter how much Zhou Lianxi's Diagram of the Great Ultimate (太極圖說) adorned the surface with the Book of Changes (易學), the foundation of Confucian thought, its content seems to have been considerably influenced by the Buddhist theory of True Suchness (眞如論) and the Daoist theory of the Great One (太一說). Taking it a step further, historical evidence clearly shows that it drew upon the Diagram of the Limitless (無極圖) by Chen Xiyi (陳希夷), a proponent of the unity of the three teachings. This is undoubtedly true for his successors Shao Yong, Zhang Zai, the Cheng brothers, and Zhu Xi as well. Furthermore, Lu Xiangshan's Idealism (唯心論) filled a Confucian surface with Buddhist bones.

Zhou Lianxi's theory of the Great Ultimate (太極說) explained the creation and transformation of the universe through the two great forces of yang's movement (陽動) and yin's stillness (陰靜) under a monistic Great Ultimate (太極). Shao Kangjie's Learning of the Antecedent Heaven (先天學) asserted that a monistic Antecedent Heaven (先天) governs both nature and the self through the same laws of geometric transformation. However, Lianxi's Great Ultimate and Kangjie's Antecedent Heaven are chaotic and mixed propositions, where the analytical boundary between principle (理, li) and material force (氣, qi)—that is, mind and matter—is not yet clear. At the same time, they resemble Anaximander's (아나크시만도로쓰) theory of the "apeiron" (도, 아파이론), appearing to be primitive and underdeveloped <91> ontologies.

Advancing from there, Zhang Hengqu (張橫渠), with his theory of the Great Void (太虛論), argued that the source of cosmic development lies in the monism of qi (氣的一元). Cheng Mingdao (程明道) advocated the theory of the interaction of the two qi (二氣交感論), stating that the birth, death, and transformation of the universe depend entirely on the movement, stillness, ascent, and descent of the two qi of yin and yang (陰陽二氣).

However, these were all theories of qi-monism (唯氣論), that is, materialism (唯物論), observing the existence and operation of the universe solely from a materialistic perspective. Therefore, Cheng Yichuan (程伊川), harboring dissatisfied counter-thoughts, took a step forward and initiated the beginnings of li-qi dualism (理氣二元), that is, mind-matter dualism. He stated, "That which constitutes yin and yang is the Way (道). Yin and yang are qi (氣). Qi pertains to that which is below shapes (形而下者); the Way pertains to that which is above shapes (形而上者)." Thus, he attempted to explain the existence of the universe through both the Way and qi, that is, li and qi.

However, this was still a simple and vague li-qi dualism lacking clear explanation. In short, it was merely a precursor thought that would inspire Zhu Xi's later dualism. That is, Cheng Yichuan's vague dualism required Zhu Xi's explanation to become systematically clarified.

Zhu Xi (朱熹) stated, "Li and qi are definitely not one thing. But when viewed within things, the two are fused and cannot be separated. Yet, the two are not prevented from being two. If viewed from the perspective of li, even if the thing is not present, its principle is already complete. Also, there is only li, but that thing does not yet actually exist." Thus, he clearly distinguished between li and qi. He also said, "Fundamentally, li and qi have no priority. But if one wishes to trace their origin, then li comes first and qi comes after." Thus, he spoke of the conceptual priority of li and qi, while also providing the thorough explanation of "one yet two, two yet one" (一而二二而一) by stating, "Li is not a separate thing; it exists precisely within qi. Without this qi, li also has no place to attach itself." He further explained the difference in the nature of li and qi: "Qi can condense, combine, create, and shape. Li, however, has no feelings, intentions, plans, or creative power. Only when this qi gathers and condenses, li is naturally present within it." Thus, he clearly elucidated Yichuan's vague theory of li and qi, clarified Lianxi's vague theory of the Great Ultimate by stating, "The Great Ultimate is simply the one word 'li'," and firmly established the banner of li-qi dualism by asserting, "Where there is this li, there is qi."

The doctrines of the Song Confucians can be said to have reached systematic completion at this point. However, their thought was still simple. Zhang Zai and Cheng Hao's qi-monism failed to clearly explain the position of li—that is, the relational boundary and nature of li and qi (mind and matter)—and especially failed to realize its indestructibility (物質不滅, indestructibility of matter). Cheng Yi and Zhu Xi's li-qi dualism lacked a practical explanation of dependent origination (緣起). Moreover, their dualism itself, as often seen in the West (Spinoza's thought; 스피노새) and India (Sāṃkhya school's thought; 僧企耶派), represents a developed thought from the late medieval period in philosophical history. Its shortcomings were finally supplemented and completed through the hands of Korean philosophers: Masters Hwadam, T'oegye, Yulgok, and Nosa (蘆沙).

Ah! How great! Such is the intellectual power of us Koreans. Ah! <92> How glorious! Such is the history of our Eastern Peninsula. What contributions did our ancestors' intellectual power, our predecessors' thought, make to world culture? As a Korean youth of the future who has received their bloodline and inherited their character, while praying for the complete success of world culture, I take up my brush to introduce the general outline of Master Hwadam's thought, starting from the development of Korean Confucian thought.
(Note: Lu Xiangshan's Idealism and the doctrines of Yuan and Ming Confucians are omitted as their direct influence is small.)

5. Outline of the Development of Korean Confucianism Before the Master

The introduction of primitive Confucianism into Korea, even before the birth of Confucius (孔子), dates back to the time of Kija (箕子). However, that was merely primitive thought. The importation of concrete Confucianism, that is, after Confucius, seems to have begun in the early Three Kingdoms period. According to historical records, in the 2nd year of King Sosurim (小獸林王) of Koguryŏ (高句麗) (壬申 year), 1,550 years ago, a National Academy (大學) was established to educate the children of the elite. In the 52nd year of King Koi (古爾王) of Paekche (百濟) (丙午 year), 1,636 years ago, a Paekche man named Wang In (王仁) took the Analects (論語) and the Classic of Filial Piety (孝經) to Japan (日本) and taught the Japanese. After 300-400 years passed, from the reign of King Chinp'yŏng (眞平王) of Silla (新羅) onwards, Silla people frequently traveled to China (唐人) to seek Tang aid in the wars between the Three Kingdoms. During this time, they greatly imported both Confucian and Buddhist thought from China. Two great figures emerged: Wŏnhyo (元曉) in Buddhism and Sŏl Ch'ong (薛聰) in Confucianism. Sŏl Ch'ong interpreted the Nine Classics (九經) using vernacular script (方言, likely referring to Idu), greatly promoting Confucian thought. During the North-South States period (南北朝鮮時代), following the emergence of Confucian students in China, the import of Confucianism was not insignificant. However, due to persecution by Buddhist thought, which was exclusively revered at the time, it did not develop greatly.

During the 400 years of Koryŏ (高麗), Buddhism also held sway. Although several distinguished scholars like Kim Yang-gam (金良鑑) and Ch'oe Ch'ung (崔文憲, 沖) emerged intermittently and promoted it, Confucianism remained weak and stagnant. Towards the end of the dynasty, during the reigns of King Ch'ungnyŏl (忠烈王) and King Ch'ungsŏn (忠宣王), as interactions with the Yuan Dynasty (元國) became frequent, Chinese Confucian thought was reintroduced. An Mun-sŏng (安文成, An Hyang 安裕) devoted himself to its revival movement. U Yŏk-tong (禹易東, U T'ak 禹倬) and Yun Ŏn-i (尹彦頤) specialized in the study of the Book of Changes (易學). Paek I-jae (白彛齋, Paek I-jŏng 白頤正) imported the doctrines of Cheng Yi and Zhu Xi (程朱). Kwŏn Kuk-chae (權菊齋, Kwŏn Pu 權溥) and Pak Ch'ung-jwa (朴忠佐) published them, disseminating them throughout the country. Yi Ik-chae (李益齋, Yi Che-hyŏn 李齊賢) and Yi Mog-ŭn (李牧隱, Yi Saek 李穡) continued to import and propagate them. Figures like Chŏng P'o-ŭn (鄭圃隱, Chŏng Mong-ju 鄭夢周), Kil Ya-ŭn (吉冶隱, Kil Chae 吉再), and Kwŏn Yang-ch'on (權陽村, Kwŏn Kŭn 權近) studied and interpreted them, greatly promoting them. The hearts of the people, pushed away by corrupt Buddhism, responded greatly, and the Confucian trend surged.

In the early Yi Dynasty (李朝), its residual influence was strong. Furthermore, as the political strategy of the Yi Dynasty <93> was to reject Buddhism and cultivate Confucianism, the people's hearts completely turned towards it. Amidst this, sage kings like Sejong (世宗) and Sŏngjong (成宗) encouraged it from above, while great Confucians like Kim Chŏm-p'il (金佔畢, Kim Chong-jik 金宗直), Kim Han-hon (金寒暄, Kim Koeng-p'il 金宏弼), Chŏng Il-tu (鄭一蠹, Chŏng Yŏ-ch'ang 鄭汝昌), and Cho Chŏng-am (趙靜庵, Cho Kwang-jo 趙光祖) successively emerged from below and promoted it. Consequently, Confucian thought permeated the entire society.

However, regardless of the era or culture, importing another's thought and culture requires at least 100 years of dedicated effort to digest and chew it, transforming it into one's own culture. Our history of Confucianism did not deviate from this principle. From the late Koryŏ period to the early Yi Dynasty, spanning about 100 years, was purely an era of importing Chinese thought, limited to studying and interpreting it. To put it plainly, no matter how much we revere predecessors like Chŏng P'o-ŭn, Kim Chŏm-p'il, and Cho Chŏng-am as great scholars, they swallowed Chinese thought whole, as Chinese thought, and Chinese-style Confucianism as Chinese-style Confucianism. Their thought was not Koreanized thought; their Confucianism was not Koreanized Confucianism. It was interpretive and derivative, not creative and pioneering. Going a step further, they were merely precursors to future creators and pioneers, opening the way and laying the foundation.

The true creator and pioneer of Koreanized thought, of Koreanized Confucianism, was Master Hwadam (花潭 先生), born as the crystallization of 4,000 years of Korean cultural history and the fruit of 200 years of importing Song learning (宋學). He was the vanguard of the pioneers, and all successors like T'oegye (退溪), Yulgok (栗谷), and Nosa (蘆沙) followed in his footsteps. Thus, the flower of 500 years of Korean culture bloomed, and the fruit of 3,000 years of East Asian Confucianism ripened. From here, as the main theme of this essay, I wish to introduce the outline of the doctrines of Master Hwadam, the vanguard of the pioneers.

6. Outline of the Master's Thought

In the poll for Great Figures in Kaebyŏk (開闢) Issue No. 13, the Master received the highest score as a scientist (科學家). However, this is not accurate. It is a sign that general society has not yet fully understood the Master's thought. The Master was not merely a scientist. He was both a scientist and a philosopher (哲學者). Rather than science, philosophy is the Master's truly great aspect. However, the Master's method of research truly applied a scientific research method. In the East, which lacked scientific thought, it was truly a unique and creative research method, arguably surpassing Francis Bacon's (푼란시쓰·뻬콘) inductive method. The Master realized that the foundation of physical research (物理的 硏究) lies in mathematics (數學). Therefore, he declared, "Numbers must be known; the intricate web of principles lies in numbers" (數不可不知, 理之縱橫錯綜在數字). Thus, the first step in the Master's learning was mathematics, which he also applied to his research methodology. But the Master's greatness lies not in science, but in the philosophical trend built upon scientific research <94>, namely Qi-monism (唯氣論, Material Monism), which is truly great. Even more so, his Theory of the Indestructibility of Matter (物質不滅論) is even more creative and brilliantly radiant, but this too is philosophical, not scientific.

The Master wrote, "The Great Void (太虛) is tranquil and formless, called the Antecedent Heaven (先天). Its beginning is without start; its origin cannot be investigated" (太虛湛然牙形, 號之曰先天, 其先無始, 其來不可究). Thus, at the outset, he prominently inscribed the proposition about the beginningless and endless totality of the universe. Following this, he stated, "What the Yi Jing calls 'silent and unmoving' (寂然不動), what the Doctrine of the Mean calls 'sincerity is self-completing' (誠者自成), speaking of its tranquil substance (軆), it is called Qi (氣); speaking of its undifferentiated pervasiveness, it is called the Great One (太一); Zhou Lianxi, having no alternative (summary omitted), called it 'Limitless yet Great Ultimate' (無極而太極). This is the Antecedent Heaven" (易所謂寂然不動, 庸所謂誠者自成, 語其湛然之軆則曰氣, 語其混然之周則曰太一, 濂溪不得已(畧寫)曰無極而太極, 是則先天). Here, he captured the various terms used exclusively by previous philosophers and skillfully proved his own theory of Qi-monism (氣元論), that the existence of the universe consists solely of Qi.

Going a step further, he wrote, "How wondrous! How marvelous! Suddenly leaping, suddenly opening—who causes it? It is capable of doing so itself; it also cannot but be so. This is called the timeliness of principle (理之時). What the Yi Jing calls 'stimulated, it penetrates' (感而遂通), what the Doctrine of the Mean calls 'the Way is self-pervading' (道自周), what Zhou [Lianxi] called 'the Great Ultimate moves and generates yang' (太極動而生陽). It cannot be without movement and stillness, without closing and opening. What is the reason? Since it is so of itself" (奇乎奇妙乎妙, 焂爾躍勿爾闢孰使之乎, 自能爾也亦不得不爾, 是謂理之時也, 易所謂感而遂通, 庸所謂道自周, 周所謂太極動而生陽者也. 不能無動靜無闔闢, 其故何哉旣自爾也). Thus, he demonstrated the self-existence, self-standing, self-acting, and self-stopping of the monistic Qi. Clearly put, he asserted that the fundamental existence of the universe is only Qi, and the originating motive force (緣起的 原動力) is also nothing but its own self. This is indeed a theory of dependent origination (緣起論) not inferior to the Mahāyāna Avataṃsaka school's doctrine of the dependent origination of the dharma realm (華嚴上乘의 法界緣起論).

To explain the path by which the myriad phenomena of the Posterior Heaven world (後天界) unfold from the single Antecedent Heaven (先天), the Master stated, "Since it is said 'one Qi naturally contains two,' since it is said 'the Great One contains two,' one cannot but generate two. Two can naturally generate and overcome. Qi, from its subtlety to its stirring, its generation and overcoming cause this" (旣曰一氣自含二, 旣曰太一便涵二, 一不得不生二, 二自能生克, 氣之自微以至鼓盪其生克使之也). And, "What are the two? Yin and yang (陰陽); movement and stillness (動靜). The one Qi divides into yin and yang. Yang reaches its utmost stirring and becomes Heaven; yin reaches its utmost stirring and becomes Earth" (二者何謂也, 陰陽也動靜也, 一氣之分爲陰陽, 陽極其鼓而爲天, 陰極其鼓而爲地). Thus, he explained that from the monistic substance of Qi, the two Qi of yin and yang separate themselves, and from the generation, overcoming, and stirring of these two Qi, the transformations of the Posterior Heaven world occur.

As the Master's explanation reaches this point, any reader cannot help but wonder where the term 'Li' (理), the most important term in traditional Confucian philosophy, fits in. Therefore, to remove this point of contradiction, the Master explained, "Speaking of its 'why,' it is called Li (理); speaking of its 'how marvelous,' it is called Spirit (神); speaking of its natural reality, it is called Sincerity (誠); speaking of its ability to leap and flow, it is called the Way (道); encompassing all without lack, it is called the Great Ultimate (太極)" (語其所以曰理, 語其所以妙曰神, 語其自然眞實者曰誠, 語其能躍以流行者曰道, 總以無不具曰太極). Thus, he explained the various traditional terms consistently without contradiction.

However, fearing that later generations might misunderstand, the Master took another step forward: "Outside Qi, there is no Li. Li is the controller (宰) of Qi. What is called 'controller' does not come from outside to control; it upholds the functioning of Qi, enabling it not to lose its proper 'so-ness,' and is thus called controller" (氣外無理, 理者氣之宰也, 所謂宰非自外來而宰之, 持其氣之用事, 能不失所以然之正者而謂之宰). Thus, he demonstrated that Li is merely a provisional name for the laws governing the transformations of Qi, not a separate reality.

Reading the Master's extant works up to this point, setting aside the correctness of Qi-monism itself, one cannot help but admire how the Master's thought and explanation are thoroughly systematic and organized, without the slightest leak. <95>

The Master further stated, "Li does not precede Qi. Qi is without beginning, so Li is naturally without beginning. If one says Li precedes Qi, then Qi has a beginning" (理不先於氣, 氣無始理固無始, 若曰理先於氣則是氣有始也). Thus, he implicitly refuted Zhu Xi's theory that "Li precedes Qi" (理先氣後). He also stated, "Laozi said, 'The void can generate Qi.' If this were so, then Qi would have a beginning and an end" (老氏曰虛能生氣, 是則氣有始有限也), thus refuting Laozi's thought.

From here, the Master took another step forward, asking, "Qi is without beginning, without birth. Since it has no beginning, where can it end? Since it has no birth, how can it perish?" (氣無始也無生也, 旣無始何所終, 旣無生何所滅). Thus, he revealed the principle of the beginningless, endless, unproduced, and undying nature of the universe's monistic Qi. As his conclusion, he stated, "Life, death, humans, and ghosts are merely the gathering and scattering of Qi. There is gathering and scattering, but no existence and non-existence" (死生人鬼只是氣之聚散而已, 有聚散而無有無). And, "When a person scatters, only the physical form and earthly soul (形魄) scatter. That which gathers in the tranquil, single, clear void (湛一淸虛者) ultimately does not scatter within the great void's tranquil oneness (太虛湛一之中)." Also, "Even the Qi of the subtlest things ultimately does not scatter. Why? Because Qi has no beginning, it therefore also has no end" (物之微者其氣終亦不散何者氣旣無始故又無其終). And, "Although the Qi of a single incense stick or candle appears to scatter before our eyes, its remaining Qi ultimately does not scatter. How can one say it ends in nothingness?" (雖一片香燭之氣見其有散於目前, 其餘氣終亦不散, 烏得謂之盡於無耶). Thus, he forcefully proclaimed the truth of the imperishability of matter (物質不滅).

Ah! How great! Master! Before the Master, there was no Master like him; after the Master, there has been no Master like him. His Materialism (唯物論) is a thoroughly organized thought, watertight (滴水不漏). His Theory of Dependent Origination (緣起論) rivals the Avataṃsaka school's doctrine of the dependent origination of the dharma realm. His Theory of the Indestructibility of Matter was the first proclaimed in the world (200 years before the Western theory of the indestructibility of matter).

Ah! I have often seen the high self-regard and heavy self-esteem of past philosophers and great teachers. "In the heavens above and earth below, I alone am the honored one" (天上天下唯我獨尊) was the self-esteem of the Capable Sage (能仁, Buddha). "The one and only true son of God" (獨一無二上帝眞子) is the self-esteem of Christ. "Heaven produced the virtue that is in me. What can Huan Tui do to me?" (天生德於予桓魋其於予何) was the self-regard of Confucius (仲尼). The Master also had heavy self-esteem and high self-regard. "Although this discourse may be poorly worded, it reaches insights into ground that a thousand sages did not fully transmit. Do not let it be lost midway; transmit it to later students who can receive it. Spread it throughout China and beyond, so that they may know that a scholar has emerged from the East" (此論雖辭拙然, 見到千聖不盡傳之地頭, 爾勿令中失可傳之後學, 遍諸華夷遠爾, 知東方有學者出焉). These were the Master's final words when entrusting his "Discourse on Spirits, Death, and Life" (死生人鬼論) to his disciples like Pak I-jŏng (朴頤正) and Hŏ T'ae-hwi (許太輝). One can well understand the extent of the Master's self-esteem. How can this be compared to the shallow types who, with the meager view from an anthill (穴坏), boastfully esteem themselves?

We who grew up under the Master's spiritual influence, we who are his bloodline descendants, let alone building houses on the foundation the Master laid and harvesting the fruits from the fertile field he plowed, that foundation is now entangled with wild vines, and that fertile field is covered with overgrown weeds. A priceless jade (璞玉) lies buried in the field, and pearls are covered in dust, their light faded, their value lost. Ah! We who received the Master's solemn entrustment, let alone boasting of the Master's value to the world, have reached a state where even we ourselves do not understand what the Master's thought was like. Our society truly cannot help but sigh and lament deeply.

For someone with meager knowledge like the writer to presumptuously introduce the Master's thought is excessively daunting. Furthermore, having hastily drafted this manuscript (走草) due to limited time and simple references, without leisure for refinement, not only are there particularly many rough points, but the initial plan was to describe four chapters at the end: 'The Influence and Reaction of the Master's Doctrines on the Korean Intellectual World,' 'Critiques of the Master's Doctrines by Various Predecessors,' 'Comparison of the Master's Thought with the Thought of Eastern and Western Philosophers,' and 'Conclusion.' However, due to pressing circumstances, I must stop here and plan to issue an independent booklet, 'Biography of Master Hwadam' (花潭先生傳), at a later date to apologize to the readers.
(The Writer Confesses) <96>

**Summary**

This 1921 article from the magazine *Kaebyŏk* introduces the Korean Neo-Confucian philosopher Sŏ Kyŏng-dŏk (徐敬德, 1489-1546), also known as Hwadam (花潭), as the first figure in a series on "Korea's Ten Great Figures." It details his life, rigorous self-cultivation through study and contemplation (often in poverty), and his philosophical system. The core focus is on Hwadam's unique contributions: a material monism based on *qi* (氣, material force) as the sole reality (氣的一元論) and, derived from this, his theory of the indestructibility of matter (物質不滅論), which the author claims predates similar Western concepts by 200 years. The article traces the lineage of Confucian thought from China to Korea, positioning Hwadam as a pivotal figure who moved beyond mere importation and interpretation to create a distinctly Korean philosophical system, influencing later thinkers like Yi Hwang (T'oegye) and Yi I (Yulgok).

From the perspective of Korean colonial history, this article is significant. Published during Japanese rule, its fervent elevation of a native Korean philosopher, emphasizing his originality and even preeminence over Western thought in certain aspects, carries strong nationalistic undertones. By presenting Hwadam not just as a traditional Confucian but as a figure with proto-scientific insights ("the world's first proponent of the indestructibility of matter"), the article aligns Korean heritage with modern values of science and rationality. This served to bolster national pride and assert a distinct Korean intellectual identity capable of standing independently, resisting cultural assimilation pressures from Japan and asserting Korea's place in world intellectual history.

先生의 家庭은 微微한 鄕士夫家로서 豐德에 世居하다가 先生의 外家를 딸아 松京으로 遷移하얏섯다. 先生의 曾祖는 得富. 祖는 順卿. 父는 好蕃. 母는 韓씨로서 先生과 가튼 光榮의 後孫을 둘만한 業因으로 「積德種仁」하기 屢世엇섯다. 더구나 先生의 嚴父는 謹嚴正直키로, 先生의 母夫人은 溫順慈情키로. 四隣의 崇仰을 바닷섯다. 아- 醴泉이 어찌 根源이 업스며 靈芝가 어찌 뿌리가 업스랴? 先生의 天姿가 아모리 生知일지라도 謹嚴한 嚴父의 薰陶 下에서 慈貞한 母夫人의 懷中에서 그리 純潔无垢한 良性을 保育하고 粹明通徹한 天姿를 玉成하엿섯다.
그래서 先生의 6, 7歲 時에 벌서 聰明英果하고 剛毅正直하며 長者의 敎訓에 善從하고 物理硏究에 孜孜하얏섯다. 先生의 家庭은 原來― 淸貧如洗함으로 先生의 6, 7歲時에 生涯의 補助로 田間의 蔬菜를 採取하다가 從地理鳥의 每日 一寸一尺式 漸進的으로 飛上함을 보고 深思黙念하기 數日에 마츰내 그가 地氣의 和暖함을 조차 날로 飛揚됨의 原理를 覺悟하얏다. 아- 驥馬가 아모리 어리더래도 千里의 馳聘함을 夢想하고 鶴雛가 아무리 微小하더래도 九臯의 울음을 和應하는도다. 將來 半島의 開拓的 大哲人이 될만한 先生의 天才는 幼年時代에도 種種이 表現됨이 이러하엿다.
先生의 14歲 時에 鄕村學究에게 尙書朞 3百篇을 受學하다가 學究-그의 原理를 釋明치 못함으로 先生이 退歸하야 精思深慮하기 15日에 마츰내 그의 條理를 洞悟하고 이로부터 如何한 事理라도 究得할만한 自信이 確立하야 硏究의 步武를 前進하얏섯나니라.

二, 先生의 修養時代
아-吾人의 運命은 아모리 길더래도 그의 決定은 刹那의＜86＞ 感激으로부터 되고 마는 것이다. 釋迦世尊은 迦昆羅城門 外 神秘的 感激으로부터 三界의 救主가 되엇고 「듸오시듸우쓰」는 讀史의 感激的 一滴淚로부터 日月爭光의 大史家가 되엇스며 元曉는 心, 法生滅底話頭의 感激的 衝動으로 法界의 大偉人이 되엇고 「끼본」은 『로마』 故都 夕陽森林의 懷故的 一掬淚로부터 千古不磨의 大史筆이 되엇도다. 世界文化史에 美華며 半島思想界에 結晶이 될만 한 先生의 生涯도 또한 아모리 天才를 稟受하얏드래도 非常의 感激的 衝動이 어찌 업섯스랴?
先生의 18歲時에 大學을 通讀하다가 「致知在格物」章에 이를 慨然히 歎息하고 愴然히 落淚하엿다. 이 刹那동안 先生의 가슴에는 무엇이 突擊하고 先生의 神經에는 무엇이 刺戟하는 듯하엿다. 「아-사람이 되어서 어찌 宇宙의 眞理 그를 覺悟치 못하고야 사람이며. 士子가 되어서 그를 格究치 못하고야 글을 읽어 무엇하랴?」 하면서 이로부터 크게 發憤하야 天地萬物의 名稱을 壁上에 列書하고 날마다 그를 窮究하기에 거의 廢寢忘飯케 되엇섯다. 아-이가 先生의 眞理的 生涯에 透入하는 最先의 經路요 最初의 感激的 衝動으로서 先生의 40年 長歲月의 前途는 이로부터 支配되고 先生의 千古不磨의 大思想은 이로부터 放光되기 시작하엿다.
先生의 眉字가 軒昻하고 先生의 眼目이 曙星가트며 先生의 聰明이 絶俗하고 先生의 剛毅가 過人하엿다. 先生은 이가튼 非凡의 天姿로서 「蚊子上鐵牛」的 至誠과 「沉船破釜甑的」 最後의 用工을 兼하엿다. 先生이 이로부터 閉門危坐하야 精思力究하기 數十餘年에 往往이 時空을 超越하고 寢食을 妄却하얏다. 더구나 赤貧如洗한 先生의 家庭에서는 6, 7日間 絶火도 되엇스며 思索에 專力하는 先生의 精神에는 10餘日間-睡眠도 謝絶하얏섯다. 마는 春風和雨의 先生의 顔上에는 一片의 暗影이 업섯고 光風霽月인 先生의 胸中에는 一道의 光明이 비첫섯다.
眞理의 질김과. 自然의 깁에 醉하고 무친 先生의 눈에는 榮辱이 頓忘되고 富貴를 浮雲視하얏다. 그래서 中宗 14年(先生의 31歲時 己卯) 趙光祖 改革運動時에 先生이 賢良科에 首遷이 되엇스나 先生은 그를 快然히 辭免하고 말엇섯다.
先生의 用工이 넘우 過酷함으로 先生과 가튼 健康한 身軆와 强固한 頭腦로도 마츰내 氣血이 鬱結하고 神經이 衰弱하야 一時에는 苦境과 悲運에 빠졋섯다. 그래서 先生은 34歲時에 身軆를 鍛鍊하고 精神을 修養키 爲하야 名山大川에 旅遊의 길을 떠낫다. 그래서 金剛, 俗離, 智異 等 名山에 周遊하얏섯다. 先生은 原來에 自然을 最愛함으로＜87＞ 名山勝地를 만날 제마다 豪興을 못이기어 글짓고 노래하고 춤추기를 마지안하엿다. 그의 金剛山詩에는 「聞說金剛勝, 空懷二十年. 旣來淸景地, 况値好秋天. 溪菊香初動, 嚴楓紅欲燃. 行吟林壑底, 心麗覺蕭然」이라 하야 金剛의 自然을 歎美하얏다.(外他 諸詩는 紙面上 關係로 紹介치 못함)
先生이 旅行한지 1年만에 精神의 聰明과 肉體의 健康이 快復됨으로 이에 學問에 더욱 專力하야 幌然한 眞理的 覺悟境에 進步케 되엇나니라.

三,.先生의 老成時代
先生의 43歲時에 母夫人의 命令으로 科場에 擧赴하야 成均生員을 마쳣스나 또한 富貴가 그의 素志가 아님으로 다시 紅塵에 染身치 안하엿고 56歲時에 厚陵叅奉의 拜命을 바닷스나 또한 固辭不就하고 마츰내 靑山이 峨峨하고 綠水가 洋洋한 花潭逝斯亭畔에서 麋鹿의 벗, 猿鶴의 짝으로 眞理의 꿈을 꾸고 自然의 춤을 추면서. 邵堯夫張橫渠輩의 古人을 追慕하고 朴和叔(淳) 許太輝(曄) 輩의 後進을 敎導하얏도다.
「絶火兩日, 日巳亭午, 議論動人, 容無困悴」라 함은 李石潭의 記錄이요 「苔滿鼎鐺, 敲琴高咏」이라 함은 許草堂의 讚歎이며 「當年如得見, 勝讀十年書」라 함은 李退溪의 追慕요 「松都三絶, 先生爲首」라 함은 黃眞娘의 欽仰이며
讀書當日志經綸, 歲暮還甘顔氏貧. 富貴有爭難下手, 林泉無禁可安身. 採山釣水堪充腹, 咏月吟風足暢神. 學到不疑眞快活, 免敎虛作百年人.
將身無愧立中天, 興入淸和境界邊. 不是吾心薄卿相, 從來素志在林泉. 誠明事業恢遊刃, 玄妙機關好着鞭, 主敬工夫方對越滿窓風月自悠然.
이라 함은 先生의 自道요 自讚한 바일다. 이 어찌 樂天 知命的 君子人이 아니며. 安心立命的 人生觀을 自覺함이 아니냐? 아-先生의 安閑自得한 氣像과 蕭灑淸淨한 神韻은 千古의 後人을 起警하도다.
大大雪山의 高峯인가? 大紅蓮의 美華인가? 朝陽의 瑞鳳인가? 雲中의 仙鶴인가? 내 무엇으로 先生을 讚美하며. 내 무엇으로 先生을 模寫하랴? 내 아무리 배우고자한들 배우며. 이름하고자한들 이름할소냐?
先生의 道德이 더욱 圓熟하고 先生의 學問이 더욱 老成하매 이에 56歲의 頹齡으로 數十年來에 含蓄蘊貯한 自覺的 眞理를 吐하야 原理氣, 理氣說, 太極說, 鬼神死生論의 14篇으로 先生의 主腦的 思想인 氣的 一元論과 物質不滅論을＜88＞ 敍述하고 聲音解, 皇極經世數解, 卦圖解, 卦變解等篇으로 羲易邵學을 祖述하야 先生의 獨特의 所長인 數理學으로 宇宙變化의 象數를 解釋하엿다.
「仁者必壽」의 原則을 遵守치 안는 無心의 蒼天은 마츰내 先生의 遐壽를 許諾치 안하얏다. 그래서 58歲를 1期로 마치고 明宗大王 元年(丙午) 距今 376年(西紀 1546年) 7月 7日에 莞爾微笑中에서 現世를 告別하엿다. 아-「哲人萎矣泰山頹矣」로 다임일흔 聖居暮雲은 千古에 寃恨이 사모치고 主人업는 花潭逝波는 至今도 嗚咽하도다. 마는 先生은 갓더래도 先生의 精神은 남어잇고 先生의 肉體的 生命은 58歲의 短時日로 마쳣더례도 先生의 眞理的 思想은 千萬年에 無窮하리로다.
내-이로부터 先生의 表像的 生涯의 敍述을 마치고 先生의 思想的 方面을 說明코자 하노라.

四. 先生 以前의 中國儒敎 思想發展의 梗槪
先生은 勿論 哲學家요. 儒家일다. 儒家 中에도 深邃하고 銳利한 獨創的 哲學者요. 哲學家 中에도 穩健하고 着實한 儒敎的 思想家일다. 한거름을 더 나아가 말하면 儒敎가 그의 生涯요, 儒敎的 思想이 그의 生命이며 光彩일다. 누구이던지? 先生의 生涯 곳 先生의 歷史를 說明하랴면 勿論-先生의 實際的 生涯보다는 先生의 思想的 方面에 置重치 아니할 수 업슬 것이다. 그를 노코서는 先生의 빗이 업슬 것이요. 先生의 價値를 求할 곳이 업스리라. 黃口幼兒의 後生인 筆者로서 猥濫이 先生을 紹介코자함은 勿論-惶悚한 바이지마는, 旣爲 붓을 들고 先生을 紹介코자하는 以上에는 筆者도 또한 先生의 思想的 方面. 곳 先生의 儒敎哲學的 槪念에 置重치 아니할 수 업는 同時에 그의 由來와 源泉으로서 先生의 思想上에 重大한 關係와 連絡이 잇는 中國儒敎思想이 史的 發展의 狀況을 먼저 敍述치 아니하야서는 안될 것이다. 그가 아니면 곳 先生의 思想을 說明키 困難할 것이다. 그럼으로 먼저 그의 梗槪를 說明코자 하노라.
倫理中心的 思想은 勿論 中國人의 特色이요 中國思想의 中心問題며, 더구나 儒敎의 綱領이요 主義일다. 그럼으로 그네는 모다 萬般의 事爲를 倫理的 立場으로 解決코자 하얏다. 政治로는 「君君臣臣父父子子」의 理想國을 夢想하얏고 處世로는 「孝者百行之源」을 부르지젓고. 哲學으로는 「性善性惡」이 그네의 中心的 係爭問題로서 「天命之謂性」이 그네의 究竟的 極點이요 發端的＜89＞ 初步(史的)일다. 바루 말하면 儒敎의 原始時代 곳 그의 敎祖인 仲尼는 차라리 理想的 方面을 等棄하고 實際的 方面 곳 實踐的 倫理를 專主하엿다. 그래서 「罕言命與仁」하시며. 「未知生焉知死」며 「未知事人焉知事鬼」리오 하야 現實以外의 思索을 餘地업시 排斥하얏다. 그럼으로 聖門의 高弟인 子貢으로도 「夫子之言性與天道不可得而聞」이라 慨歎하얏섯다. 바루 말하면 仲尼의 主張은 現實的 生涯에 沒頭한 우리人生으로서는 現實以外 곳 空漠한 理想的 方面에는 넘어다 볼 必要가 업슴을 言明하얏다.
그러나 吾人의 知識的 要求의 衝動은 原理的 說明이 업는 信條하에 盲從함을 許諾치 아니할뿐 아니이라. 當時에 楊子江流域에서 萬丈氣焰을 吐하던 南中國的 文化 곳 老莊列楊輩의 玄奧한 理想的 學說이 擧世를 風靡하는 同時에 理想的 立脚이 薄弱한 儒敎의 生命이 조차 危懼케 되엿섯다. 그럼으로 그를 對抗키 爲하야서는 相當한 倫理的 理想 곳 儒敎的 哲學을 建設치 아니하야서는 안되겟섯다. 그래서 子思는 「天命之謂性」을 首唱하야 儒家哲學의 端緖를 啓發하얏고 孟子는 「性善」. 荀子는 「性惡」說을 主張하야 倫理의 基礎的 思想을 樹立하랴 하얏섯다. 그러나 그는 다 儒敎哲學의 原始的 萌芽時代에 斷片的 發現으로서, 組織이 업고 聯絡이 업고 繼統이 업고 統一이 업섯다. 더구나 秦漢以後 1500年間에는 儒敎의 沈衰暗黑時代로서, 그의 思想을 繼承하고 發揮한 者가 업섯다. 董氏(仲舒)의 道原說은 疎畧에 기울고. 楊氏(雄)의 太玄論은 老莊에 흐르고. 王氏(通)의 執中說은 皮相에 그쳣슬 뿐. 勿論-理想的 儒學者가 업섯다.
東漢時代부터 輸入되기 始作한 佛敎. 곳 玄奧神秘한 印度的 思想은 滔滔洪水와 가티 一瀉千里의 急潮的 勢力으로 『파밀』高原을 넘고 『마라카』를 돌아 中國 全大陸을 風靡하면서 在來에 立脚이 鞏固치 못하던 中國的 文化思想을 蹂躪케 되엇다. 그럼으로 張融, 周顒, 陳希夷輩의 三敎一致論, 곳 中國 印度 兩大사조의 調和的 運動이 업지 안하얏섯다. 그러치마는 곳 反應이 업고 功績이 업고 마츰내 失敗에 돌아갈 뿐이엇섯다.
이에 宋朝에 至하야 그의 反動으로 周濂溪(淳頣), 邵康節(雍), 程明道(顥), 程伊川(頣), 張橫渠(載) 等 諸哲人이 繼出하야 儒敎的 思想을 一層 組織的으로 建設하고 儒家的 立場을 一層 鮮明케 하야 佛敎思想을 對抗하얏고 더욱이나 大哲人 朱晦庵(熹) 陸象山(九淵)이 幷起하야 그를 集大成함에. 이에 儒敎의 勢力 俄然이＜90＞ 殷盛하야 東亞思想界에 覇權을 掌握케 되엇나니. 이에 順次로 宋儒의 思想의 梗槪를 說明코자 하노라.
勿論-儒家의 主眼은 倫理이다. 그럼으로 그의 哲學的 思想도 倫理的 入場에 出發하얏섯다. 그래서 그의 結果는 本軆論에 그치고 말엇다. 勿論-認識論이나 美學의 範圍에는 夢想에도 미치지 못하얏섯다. 萬一-儒敎哲學이라 하며는 그는 곳 누구이던지 무를 것도 업시 本軆論 倫理學 뿐으로 알고 말것이다. 더구나 그의 內容은 獨斷論로서 宇宙의 實在를 盲目的으로 肯定하고 吾人의 覺悟를 大膽的으로 是認하엿다. 20世紀 哲學的 思潮에 比較하면 勿論-그의 內容이 幼穉하고 그의 範圍가 偏小함은 말할 것도 업다. 마는 本論의 範圍는 儒家의 思想을 現代的으로 批評코자 함이 아니요. 儒家思想 그의 史的 發展의 狀態를 그대로 紹介하야 花潭先生의 思想의 原流를 探究하랴 함임으로 是非正否를 勿論하고 儒家思想의 中心問題인 本軆論 倫理說 뿐. 그를 그대로 紹介하랴한다. 아니 한거름 더 나아가 말하면 本論의 主題인 花潭先生의 學說로 後世에 遺傳됨은 儒敎思想에도 本軆論의 一部뿐으로서 倫理的 思潮를 窺見할만한 先生의 遺著도 무엇도 後世에 끼침이 업다. 先生의 思考 中- 唯一無二한 本軆論을 紹介코자하는 筆者는 차라리 中國 儒家思想 中의 本軆論의 一部뿐 敍述코자 하노라. 그래서 卽今-敍述코자하는 儒家哲學의 組織的 時代, 곳 宋儒의 思想도 本軆論의 一部뿐 紹介코자 한다.
宋儒의 思想은 儒敎를 擁護하고 仙佛 兩敎의 排斥을 主張하얏스나 其實은 仙佛 兩家思想의 影響이 적지 안하얏섯다. 바루 말하면 仙佛 兩家의 思想을 吸收하야 換骨脫態的으로 儒敎哲學을 組織하얏다. 그럼으로 周濂溪의 太極圖說은 아무리 儒家思想의 根底인 易學의 表面을 粧飾하얏더래도 그의 內容은 佛家의 眞如論, 仙家의 太一說의 影響을 바듬이 적지안한 듯하다. 一步를 前進하야 말하면 三敎一致論者인 陳希夷의 無極圖를 叅酌함은 史證에도 昭然한 바이다. 勿論-그의 繼承者인 邵張程朱도 그러하다. 더구나 陸象山의 唯心論은 儒敎的 表面에 佛理的 骨子로 채웟다.
周濂溪의 太極說은 一元的 太極下에서 陽動陰靜의 2大勢力으로 宇宙의 發作變化됨을 說明하얏고. 邵康節의 先天學은 一元的 先天이 同一의 幾何學的 變化의 法則으로 自然과 自我를 支配함을 主張하얏스나 濂溪의 太極과 康節의 先天은 混淪周雜한 命題로서 아즉 理氣 곳 心物兩者의 分析的 界境이 明確치 못한 同時에 「아나크시만도로쓰」의 「도, 아파이론」說과 類似한 原始期의 未進步한＜91＞ 本軆論인 듯하다.
그에서 한번 前進하야 張橫渠는 太虛論으로 宇宙發展의 源泉이 氣的 一元에 잇슴을 主張하고 程明道는 二氣交感論을 主張하야 宇宙의 生滅變化가 陰陽二氣의 動靜升沈에 專在함을 言明하얏다.
그러나 그는 다 唯氣論 곳 唯物論으로서 宇宙의 存在와 發作을 唯物論的 方面으로 뿐 觀察하얏다. 그럼으로 그에 不滿的 反動思想을 抱含한 程伊川은 一步를 前進하야 理氣二元 곳 心物 兩元論의 端緖를 啓發하얏다. 「所以 陰陽者是道也 音陽者氣也氣 是形而下者道 是形而上者」라 하야 道與氣 곳 理與氣兩者로 宇宙의 存在를 解釋코자 하얏다.
그러나 그가 아즉도 單純朦朧한 理氣 兩元論으로 明確한 說明이 不足하얏섯다. 바루 말하면 그는 將來-朱晦庵의 二元論을 啓發할만한 前導的 思想에 不過하얏다. 곳 程伊川의 朦朧한 二元論은 朱晦庵의 說明을 期待하야서야 組織的으로 彰明이 되겟다.
朱朱晦庵은 「理與氣決非一物. 但在物上看則二者渾淪無分開. 然二者不害爲二. 若在理上看則雖物不在焉巳具物理. 亦但有理未嘗實有是物」이라 하야 理氣兩者를 判然이 區分하얏고. 「理氣本無先後. 然欲推其所從來. 則理先而氣後」라 하야 理氣의 想像的 先後를 말하면서 「理非別物卽是氣而存. 無是氣則理亦無掛搭處』라 하야 「一而二二而一」的 說明을 周到하며 「氣則能凝結造作. 理却無情意, 無計度, 無造作. 只此氣凝聚處理便在其中」이라 하야 理氣兩者의 性質의 異點을 說明하야 伊川의 朦朧한 理氣說을 明確히 聲明하고 「太極只是理一字」라 하야 濂溪의 朦朧한 太極說을 釋明하며 「此有理便有氣」라 하야 理氣二元論의 旗幟를 鮮明케 樹立하얏다.
宋儒의 學說도 이에 이르러 組織이 完成되얏다 할만하도다. 그러나 그네의 思想이 아즉도 單純하야 張程의 氣元論은 理의 位置, 곳 理氣(心物)의 關係的 界限과 性質을 明確히 說明치 못하얏스며 더구나 그의 不滅性(物質不滅)을 悟得치 못하얏고. 程朱의 理氣兩元論은 緣起의 方便的 說明이 업섯스며. 더구나 그 兩元論의 自體가 往往 이 西洋에서도, 印度에서도(스피노새의 思想僧企耶派의 思想)보는 바와 가티 哲學史上에 中世期末 進步한 思想일다. 그의 缺點은 마츰내 朝鮮의 哲人 花潭, 退溪, 栗谷, 蘆沙 諸先生의 손을 經過하야서야 補充이 되고 完成이 되엇도다.
아- 偉大하다. 우리朝鮮人의 腦力도 이러하다. 아-＜92＞ 榮華로다. 우리 東半島의 歷史도 이러하다. 우리 祖宗의 腦力으로, 우리先輩의 思想으로 世界的 文化에 貢獻함이 과연 어떠 하얏섯는가? 筆者는 그의 血統을 밧고 傳性을 이은 未來의 朝鮮靑年으로 世界的 文化의 完成的 成功이 잇슴을 祝願하면서 붓을 들어 朝鮮儒敎思想의 發展으로부터 花潭先生의 思想의 一般을 紹介코자 하노라.
(但 陸象山의 唯心論과 元明諸儒의 學說은 直接的 影響이 적음으로 畧함)

5. 先生 以前의 朝鮮 儒敎發展의 梗槪
孔子 誕生 以前-곳 原始的 儒敎의 朝鮮에 輸入됨은 箕子時代부터 되엇섯다. 그러나 그는 다만 原始的 思想이오 孔子 以後 곳 具體的 儒敎의 輸入됨은 三國時代 初葉부터 된 듯하다. 史證의 記錄으로 보면 高句麗 小獸林王 2年(壬申) 距今 1,550年에 大學을 設立하고 子弟를 敎育하얏다 하며 百濟 古爾王 52年(丙午) 距今 1,636年에 濟人 王仁이 論語와 孝經을 가지고 日本에 가서 日本人을 敎授하얏다 하얏섯다. 이로부터 3, 400年을 經過하야 新羅 眞平王 以後로는 三國戰爭에 唐人의 援助를 엇기 위하야 羅人이 자주 中國에 往來하는 동안에 中國의 儒佛 兩敎의 思想을 크게 輸入하면서 佛敎에는 元曉, 儒敎에는 薛聰, 兩大 偉人이 繼出하얏섯다. 그래서 薛聰은 方言으로 九經을 解釋하야 儒敎思想을 크게 鼓吹하고 南北朝鮮時代에도 中國 儒學生의 輩出함을 딸아 儒敎의 輸入됨이 적지 안하얏섯다. 그러나 當時에 專尙하던 佛敎思想의 迫害로 因하야 그가 크게 發展되지 못하얏섯다.
高麗 4百年間에도 佛敎가 專盛함으로 金良鑑
崔文憲(沖) 등 若干의 碩儒가 間出하야 그를 高趣하얏스나 또한 微微 不振하얏섯다. 그의 末葉 忠烈, 忠宣王時에 元國과의 交通함이 頻煩함을 딸아 中國 儒敎思想이 다시 輸入되면서 安文成(裕)은 그의 再興運動에 專力하얏고. 禹易東(倬, 尹彦頤는 易學을 專攻하고 白彛齋(頤正)는 程朱의 學說을 輸入함며 權菊齋(溥), 朴忠佐는 그를 刊行하야 全國에 普及케 하고 李益齋(齊賢), 李牧隱(穡)은 그를 繼續的으로 輸入 宣傳하며 鄭圃隱(夢周), 吉冶隱(再), 權陽村(近) 輩는 그를 硏究하고 解釋하야 크게 鼓吹하매 腐敗한 佛敎에 壓退된 人心이 크게 響應하야 儒風이 大振하얏섯나니라.
李朝 初年에도 그의 餘風이 大振하며 李朝의 政略이 또한＜93＞ 佛敎를 排斥하고 儒敎를 培養함으로 人心이 그에 全靡하는 中에 우에서는 世宗 成宗 가튼 聖君이 그를 奬勵하고 알에서는 金佔畢(宗直), 金寒暄(宏弼), 鄭一蠹(汝昌), 趙靜庵(光祖) 가튼 大儒가 續出하야 그를 鼓吹하얏슴으로 儒敎 思想이 全社會에 浹洽하얏섯나니라.
그러나 어느 時代 어느 文化를 勿論하고 남의 思想, 남의 文化를 輸入하랴면 적어도 1百年 동안의 專力이 아니면 그를 消化하고 그를 咀嚼하야 自家的 文化로 換成치 못하는 法일다. 곳 우리의 儒敎史도 그의 원칙을 벗어나지 못하얏섯다. 麗末부터 李朝 초까지 約 1百餘 年間은 純全한 中國思想의 輸入時代로서 그를 硏究하고 解釋함에 지내지 못하얏섯다. 바루 말하면 鄭圃隱, 金佔畢, 趙靜庵 諸 先輩를 아무리 碩學이라 崇拜하더래도 그네는 곳 中國思想을 中國思想대로, 中國式 儒敎를 中國式 儒敎대로 全呑하얏섯다. 그네의 思想은 朝鮮化의 思想이 아니오 그네의 儒敎는 朝鮮化의 儒敎가 아니엇다. 解釋的이오 因襲的이며, 創造的이오 開拓的이 아니엇섯다. 한거름을 더 나아가 말하면 그네는 將來의 創造者 開拓的의 先驅로서 길을 열고 터를 닥금에 지내지 못하얏섯다.
正말 朝鮮化的 思想, 朝鮮化的 儒家로서 創造者요 開拓者가 된 이는 4千年 朝鮮文化史의 結晶으로, 200年 宋學 輸入史의 證果로 誕生하신 花潭 先生이 그이시다. 그가 開拓者의 最先鋒으로서 退溪
栗谷
蘆沙 等 모든 繼承者도 그의 뒤를 잇대어 輩出하얏다. 그래서 5百年 朝鮮文化의 꼿이 피엇고 3千年 東洋 儒敎의 여름이 매쳣다. 이로부터서는 本論의 主題로서 開拓者의 最先鋒인 花潭 先生의 學說의 梗槪를 紹介코자 하노라.

6. 先生의 思想의 梗槪
開闢 第13號 偉人 投票에 先生이 科學者의 最高點을 어덧섯다. 그러나 그는 正鵠이 아닐다. 一般 社會에서 아즉 先生의 思想을 充分히 理解치 못한 表徵일다. 先生은 單純한 科學者가 아닐다. 科學家요 哲學者일다. 차라리 科學보다도 哲學 그가 先生의 偉大한 點일다. 그러나 先生의 硏究의 方式은 정말 科學的 硏究方式을 應用하얏섯다. 科學的 思想이 缺乏한 東洋에서는 참으로 唯一無二한 創作的 硏究方式으로서 「푼란시쓰·뻬콘」의 歸納法을 凌駕할만 하얏섯다. 先生은 物理的 硏究의 基礎가 數學에 잇슴을 覺悟하엿다. 그래서 「數不可不知, 理之縱橫錯綜在數字」라 言明하엿다. 그럼으로 先生의 學問의 初步는 數學으로서 그를 硏究的 方式에도 應用하엿다마는 先生의 偉大한 點은 科學이 아니오 科學的 硏究＜94＞ 우에서 建設한 哲學的 思潮, 곳 唯氣論(唯物論) 그가 참으로 偉大한 點일다. 그보다도 物質不滅論 그가 더 한層 創作的으로서 光輝가 燦爛하다마는 物質不滅論 그도 科學的이 아니오 哲學的일다.
先生은 「太虛湛然牙形, 號之曰先天, 其先無始, 其來不可究」라 하야 劈頭에 無始無終의 宇宙 全軆에 對한 命題를 大書特書하고 그 뒤를 이어 「易所謂寂然不動, 庸所謂誠者自成, 語其湛然之軆則曰氣, 語其混然之周則曰太一, 濂溪不得已(畧寫)曰無極而太極, 是則先天」이라 하야 過去 前哲의 專用한 各種 術語를 捕捉하야 巧妙히 自家의 氣元論 곳 宇宙의 存在가 氣的 一元 뿐임을 證明하얏다.
한거름을 더 나아가 「奇乎奇妙乎妙, 焂爾躍勿爾闢孰使之乎, 自能爾也亦不得不爾, 是謂理之時也, 易所謂感而遂通, 庸所謂道自周, 周所謂太極動而生陽者也. 不能無動靜無闔闢, 其故何哉旣自爾也」라 하야 氣的 一元의 自存自立, 自行自止함을 證明하얏다. 밝게 말하면 宇宙의 根本的 存在가 오즉 氣뿐으로서 緣起的 原動力이 또한 그 自軆이엇슬 뿐임을 언명하얏다. 이는 果然 華嚴上乘의 法界緣起論에 지지 안한 緣起論일다.
先生은 다 一元의 先天으로 萬象의 後天界의 開展되는 徑路를 說明키 위하야 「旣曰一氣自含二, 旣曰太一便涵二, 一不得不生二, 二自能生克, 氣之自微以至鼓盪其生克使之也」라 하고 「二者何謂也, 陰陽也動靜也, 一氣之分爲陰陽, 陽極其鼓而爲天, 陰極其鼓而爲地」라 하야 一元의 氣軆로부터 陰陽의 二氣가 自分하고 陰陽 二氣의 生克鼓盪으로부터 後天 世界變化作用이 됨을 言明하얏다.
先生의 說明이 이에 미치매 讀者는 그 누구던지? 在來 儒家 哲學上에 第一 重要한 理의 術語를 부칠 곳이 업슴을 疑心치 아니할 수 업슬 것이다. 그럼으로 先生은 그의 矛盾點을 除去키 爲하야 「語其所以曰理, 語其所以妙曰神, 語其自然眞實者曰誠, 語其能躍以流行者曰道, 總以無不具曰太極」이라 하야 在來 各種의 術語를 矛盾 업시 一貫的에 說明하얏다.
그러나 先生은 오히려 後人의 誤解가 잇슬가 하야 一步를 前進하야 「氣外無理, 理者氣之宰也, 所謂宰非自外來而宰之, 持其氣之用事, 能不失所以然之正者而謂之宰」라 하야 理는 氣의 變化作用上 法則의 假名이오 實在가 아님을 證明하얏다.
先生의 遺著를 읽어 이에 이르매 氣元論 그 自體의 正否는 且置하고 先生의 思想과 說明이 一毫의 滲漏處가 업시＜95＞ 徹頭徹尾히 組織的이오 系統的임을 感歎치 아니할 수 업다.
先生은 다시 「理不先於氣, 氣無始理固無始, 若曰理先於氣則是氣有始也」라 하야 隱然 中에 朱晦庵의 「理先氣後」設을 駁論하얏고 「老氏曰虛能生氣, 是則氣有始有限也」라 하야 老氏의 思想을 駁論하얏다.
이로부터 先生은 다시 一步를 前進하야 「氣無始也無生也, 旣無始何所終, 旣無生何所滅」고 하야 宇宙 一元的 氣軆의 無始無終, 不生不滅의 原理를 道破하고 그의 結論으로 「死生人鬼只是氣之聚散而已, 有聚散而無有無」라 하고 「人之散也形魄散耳, 聚之湛, 一淸虛者, 終亦不散於太虛湛一之中」이라 하며 「物之微者其氣終亦不散何者氣旣無始故又無其終」이라 하고 「雖一片香燭之氣見其有散於目前, 其餘氣終亦不散, 烏得謂之盡於無耶」아 하야 物質의 不生不滅底 眞理를 喝破하얏도다.
아-偉大하다!-先生이어! 先生 以前에 先生이 업섯고 先生 以後에 先生이 업섯도다. 先生의 唯物論으로는 滴水不漏의 徹底한 組織的 思想이오 緣起論으로는 華嚴上乘의 法界 緣起論이오 物質不滅論으로는 世界에 首唱(西洋 物質不滅論보다 2百年 前)이엇다.
아-나는 過去 哲人 大士의 自許가 놉고 自負가 重함을 往往이 보앗노라. 「天上天下唯我獨尊」은 能仁의 自負요. 「獨一無二上帝眞子」라 함은 基督의 自尊이오 「天生德於予桓魋其於予何」오 함은 仲尼의 自許일다. 先生도 또한 自負가 중하고 自許가 놉핫도다. 「此論雖辭拙然, 見到千聖不盡傳之地頭, 爾勿令中失可傳之後學, 遍諸華夷遠爾, 知東方有學者出焉」하라 함은 先生이 死生人鬼論을 朴頤正 許太輝 등 門人에게 托傳하던 遺辭일다. 先生의 自負가 또한 어떠하얏슴을 알만하도다. 이 어찌 穴坏의 微見으로 揚揚 自負하는 淺陋輩에 비길소냐?
先生의 精神的 薰陶下에서 生長한 우리로서, 先生의 血統的 後昆인 우리로서, 先生의 開拓한 土臺에 집을 짓고 先生의 起耕한 良田에 여름을 거듬은 姑捨하고, 그 土臺에 野蔓이 얼키고, 그 良田에 荒草가 덥혓다. 璞玉이 들에 무치고 珍珠가 티끌에 싸혀 그의 빗이 사라지고 그의 갑을 일케 되엇도다. 아-先生의 鄭重한 付託을 바든 우리로서 先生의 價値를 天下에 誇張키는 姑捨하고 先生의 思想이 어떠하엿슴을 우리도 理解치 못케 된 우리 社會야말로 참으로 太息痛恨치 안할 수 업도다.

筆者와 가티 蔑如한 學識으로 先生의 思想을 猥濫이 紹介한다 함은 넘우나 愧悚하온 중에 더구나 短促한 時日과 簡單한 參考로 推敲의 여가도 업시 走草하얏슴으로 荒蕪한 點이 特多할 뿐 아니오라 最初의 豫定은 『先生의 學說에 對한 朝鮮思想界의 影響과 反動』. 『先生의 學說에 對한 諸 先輩의 批評』『先生의 思想과 東西 哲人의 思想과의 比較』『結論』의 4章을 篇末에 敍述하랴 하얏더니 促急한 事故로 因하야 이만 그치고 後日에 獨立의 冊子로 『花潭先生傳』을 發行하야 讀者 諸位에게 謝過코자 하노이다.
