1. 金翠翹傳(續) (The Tale of Kim Ch'oe Kyo (Continued))
『(哭皇天) (意譯)』 (Wailing to High Heaven) (Interpretive Translation) My fate is so wretchedly thin that my family is ruined; selling this body to save my father, I fell into this den of demons (pit of fire). Early on, I wished only to die with this body; what pleasure is there in this trade, to become the lowest among humans? Falling mistakenly into the trap of a wicked person, even with ten mouths, I have no way to explain myself. Tying me to the beams, what is this beating? My whole body is minced meat. I died and came back to life. Oh my goodness, save me! But they don't listen. Begging pitifully in a hundred ways, the beating finally stopped, and they forced me, made me enter wrongly. I am originally a girl from a good family; how would I know how to touch a customer's hand? Listening to the words taught from beginning to end, it is limitlessly filthy; a person could die from it. Learning all the secret arts of managing the bedchamber, I put on makeup every night and attend to customers. When a customer isn't sleeping, I dare not sleep; when the customer falls asleep, I cannot even cough loudly. Carefully, lest the customer find me strange, my heart cannot rest; fearing the customer might leave, I cannot relax for a moment. The customer is heartless, seeking only to satisfy his own desires; leaving him to do as he pleases, I only obey. If it's a familiar customer, it's still better, but first-time customers are especially difficult. Ignoring their roughness, I force a smile and must cater to their whims. All the madam knows is her money; she doesn't distinguish between beautiful and ugly, carelessly letting anyone in. A beautiful flower is helplessly tied to a thorny bush, and a beautiful woman finds herself paired with a fool. Even if his mouth stinks, how can I push him away? Even if he has a disease in his body, who dares to avoid it? Though I pass every day like this, loathsomely, without the slightest mercy, they beat me and beat me, knowing no end? Alas, alive, I am the wife of a thousand men; if I should happen to die, I become a lonely, ownerless spirit. The most pitiful thing in human life is being a woman; among women, the most pitiful is becoming a prostitute. If one becomes a wife or concubine, there is at least a master, but once one becomes a prostitute, life and death themselves are uncertain. Thinking of this, my heart breaks (lit. golden sores form). Oh, friends of the green mansions (brothels), do not forget these words of mine; quickly extricate yourselves, escape this den of demons (pit of fire), and on another day, when my gate is deserted with no saddles or horses, do not stand idly before the west wind, shedding tears and weeping.

Ch'oe Kyo (翠翹) - Having already fallen into the pit of fire (den of demons), her glamorous name echoed through the alleys. <110> However, since entering that world of suffering (苦界), the days were still few. Thoughts naturally arose that could not be without resentment, finally coalescing into this one chapter, "Wailing to High Heaven." Though the words may not be called skillful, the meaning is sorrowful. When performed with the *ho'gŭm* (胡琴, a stringed instrument), all listeners shed tears.

Ch'oe Kyo - Seeing her greet guests with myriad captivating charms in the flowery mornings and moonlit evenings, it was not just something to behold; among the many men who wished to make her their own and place her in a golden house (金屋), there was a man from Wuhsi County (無錫縣), named Sok Su (束守). He was traveling in this area following his father. Back home, he had married the daughter of the Minister of Personnel (吏部天官), Miss Kwan (官氏), who was beautiful and wise. However, her disposition was treacherous and deceitful, but her quick talent could conceal this, allowing her to maintain appearances; her husband was in no way her equal. This is truly what is called "the hen crows at dawn" (牝鷄司晨, meaning a wife dominating her husband); as for Sok Su, he was nothing more than a powerless and spineless young master (書房님). After meeting Ch'oe Kyo once, he spent money like water, and finally, it came to the point of discussing setting up a separate household. Here, one can see that Ch'oe Kyo's conversation is not like before; it shows she has skillfully applied the secret arts passed down by the Madam (馬媽). Chapter 11 tells of the events of this period.

Chapter 12 narrates the details of taking Ch'oe Kyo away and setting her up. At the end, Sok Su incurs his father's anger and is subsequently sued before the prefect (知府). However, the prefect's romantic (風流) judgment involves commanding Ch'oe Kyo to compose a poem on the spot, declaring "She is truly a beautiful woman (眞是佳人), fitting to be matched with a gentleman (宜配君子)," and passing the verdict that they should be husband and wife forever, thus concluding the matter.

The desire to save face (體面) made Kwan-che (官姐, Sok Su's wife) forbid anyone from spreading the news of her husband taking a concubine. However, jealousy is a woman's characteristic trait; psychologically, she could not avoid feeling naturally resentful, and how could Ch'oe Kyo not know this? She perceived that her husband's (郎君) loyalty, depth, and reserve were likely no match for this "star of wisdom" (智多星, a cunning person). Beings like that spineless Sok Su are peerlessly worthless. She and he—bound by love and affection, had never had even half a word of disagreement since their marriage, yet she truly feared her (Kwan-che) like a tiger. Her conduct was so proper and strict, not handling matters carelessly, that it was like seeing a divine spirit (神明). Therefore, she dared not be presumptuous. That he feared his wife to such an extent, even concerning the matter of taking a concubine, fearing only that she would find out—what kind of mediocrity (庸物) was this? Yet, many such men exist in the world. At this point, he was to return home to visit his wife. The mediocrity, now a thing in Ch'oe Kyo's palm (掌裡), did not wish for even a temporary separation. At most half a year, at least three months; stay for one year, he must. At Ch'oe Kyo's urging words, his "liver and intestines also broke" (肝腸이 亦斷), and his tearful face was also laughable. Ch'oe Kyo's ten poems titled "What Night is Tonight" (今夕何夕) are quite worth seeing.

What night is tonight? My lord sets out on a distant journey. I, at home, frequently mark the days; I ask you, sir, on what day will you turn back?
What night is tonight? Emotion hurts, grieving the separation. One verse of the parting song, two streams of tears; I send you off under the bright moon, leaving Yang Pass. <111>
What night is tonight? Grieving the separation, no joy can form. Suddenly, the iron horse bells, tossed by the wind, startle and scatter my departing soul, making sleep difficult upon the pillow.
What night is tonight? Tomorrow morning, each in a different world. Gazing towards the pass of return, where is it? Loving but not seeing, tears stream down.
What night is tonight? The moon is full, yet people part. Two lands, mountains and rivers, over ten thousand li; I know not on what day I'll see your return.
What night is tonight? Facing each other, words are hard to find. Suddenly, I hear the tears of a lone wild goose in mid-sky, seeming to tell of parting sorrow, the conversation uneasy.
What night is tonight? Drinking drunk, I don't forget sorrow. People say wine is needed to dispel sorrow; wine enters my gut, and sorrow hastens more.
What night is tonight? Forcing a smile to charm my good man. Fearing my lord grows gaunt because of my sickness, pitying my lord's toil, I console my lord's heart.
What night is tonight? Parting in life, together with parting in death. Parting in death promises a meeting in the underworld; parting in life, in two lands, only weeping blood.

Narrating the emotions of separation in various ways, the first half of this song cycle is quite interesting. Pairing Ch'oe Kyo's bright talent (慧才) with Sok Su's mediocrity (庸劣) creates a strange brilliance. The exchange, "Tonight we sleep together in the hibiscus curtained bed (芙蓉帳), but tomorrow where will you dwell, what can be done?" (Sok Su) and "The flowing water is not yet dry, the traveler not yet old; in another year, we will rebuild the Silver River (Milky Way) as before" (Ch'oe Kyo), is exquisite in its literary expression (文辭).

The latter half of this chapter also pairs Kwan-che's bright talent with Sok Su's mediocrity, radiating a strange brilliance. The first half is separation, the latter half is reunion (合).

Sok Saeng (束生, Sok Su) was originally a simpleton (어리 백이). Returning home, just as his wife was unaware he had taken a concubine, he visited his parents-in-law. Content that there was no mention of taking a concubine, secretly rejoicing as if neither family knew, he was then hit where it hurt most with a single blow (一棒), which is truly enough to make one burst out laughing (噴飯). Let's try translating it:

One evening, the wife spoke these words. "I almost got fooled by someone. A while ago, that fellow Sok Ch'u (束芻) came back from Linzi (臨淄), and it seems he saw you, sir, drinking with something like a kisaeng (妓生). He must have been blabbering that you had set up a concubine (妾置家). How annoying! So I said, 'My husband and I get along without deceiving each other; would he do something sneaky like hiding such a baggage (다갱이) and letting the cat out of the bag (꽁문이 들어내어 놋는 짓)?' How infuriating! Look here, it was a bit much, but I had someone knock out four of that fellow's teeth (니). After that, nobody says such things anymore. Everyone knows that you, sir, probably had an occasion to call a kisaeng for medicinal wine (藥酒). Look here, what I did wasn't wrong, was it?"

Sok Saeng blushed. As if his buttocks couldn't stick to the seat, fidgeting (허둥허둥), he barely managed this reply. "Calling a kisaeng might happen sometimes for social reasons (交際), but even if I took a concubine, would that talk not reach your ears? Heh heh...<112> So you know that. Let it go."

Sun and moon are like a shuttle (日月은 如梭); suddenly, a year passed like a dream. Sok Su boarded a boat heading for Linzi. Kwan-che herself had a clever plan (妙計).

(Original Chinese text provided, describing Kwan-che's plan: Before Sok Saeng left, I wanted to capture that servant girl and take her down a peg, but I feared the bad reputation of a jealous wife and damaging the harmony between husband and wife, so I pretended not to know. Now that he has left today, I want to devise a plan, seize her, and make her a servant (了頭), just saying it was my father's plan for me. When Sok Saeng returns, we gather in one hall; he won't be able to recognize her, nor will he be able to speak out. For me, it removes the thorn in my eye without the name of a meddling woman (女平章); for him, he suffers the foolishness of a starving wildcat and fox (飢狸鼠), willingly enduring the shame of a concubine-servant (妾婦). Thus my heart's desire will be fulfilled.)

A single thought of jealousy (嫉妬) thus devised this cruel punishment (慘刑). A great blow (一大棒) was struck upon Ch'oe Kyo's person.

Even heroes (英雄) meet disaster and often lose their lives; how much more so Ch'oe Kyo, a mere woman? Being abducted by fierce slaves (豪奴) and suffering that terrible misfortune (慘禍), how could it be considered truly strange? Alone, the stern high official (大臣), for the sake of the country, worries about the people, fearing lest even one thing not find its proper place (其所); yet he allows his wife and daughter free rein at home, directing fierce slaves, and carries out these unjust and unlawful (不公不法) acts. What kind of heart is this? If he does this unknowingly, he cannot even manage (齊) his own household, how can he govern (治) the country? If he knows and deliberately allows it, it is even more impermissible. Alas! (嗟乎라) Generally, power and position (勢位) are brewed up, unnoticed and unexamined. Viewing it from this perspective, the world's grievances (寃屈) go unaddressed, and suffering (痛苦) goes unspoken; it is not just Ch'oe Kyo alone. How can it not make people sigh deeply (浩歎)? The sigh is indeed a sigh, but it is truly not a sigh for Ch'oe Kyo, but a sigh for the ways of the world and the human heart (世道人心). This is what Sŏng T'an (聖歎, Jin Shengtan) lamented bitterly in the commentary (外書) to Chapter 14, what is called borrowing another's wine cup (酒杯) to pour out one's own troubles (磊塊). Ch'oe Kyo - after Sok Saeng left, her thoughts dwelled on him, composing the six quatrains of "Since You Left" (自君之出矣).

Since you left, day by day I watch for the blue phoenix (靑鸞). The blue phoenix I watch for comes not; I only see the edge of the white clouds.
Since you left, I dare not climb the high tower. Outside the tower are willow trees; their threads inevitably stir sorrow.
Since you left, I speak not, nor do I weep. If I speak, there is no understanding ear (知音); if I weep, I fear startling my lord's sleep.
Since you left, lighting the lamp, I frequently look at my shadow. Looking at my shadow, I pace back and forth; emaciated, pitifully so.
Since you left, I hate the sun shining on the empty bed. Thin covers bring no sleep; the lonely pillow fears the harsh frost.
Since you left, not a day passes without thoughts southward. Thinking of you, sir, you come not; teardrops soak my silk skirt.

That night, going into the garden (園中), burning incense, she voiced her feelings (衷情). Under the flower shade, suddenly a dozen or so strong men (壯丁) appeared, bound (綁) Ch'oe Kyo, forced poison (毒) into her mouth, then set fire to her house, pretending to push Ch'oe Kyo into the main hall <113>, mounted horses, and vanished like a gust of dark wind (陰風). Neighbors extinguishing the fire found a corpse (屍體) in the ashes (燼中). The crowd pitied her (憐之), cremated (茶毘) her, turning her into a wisp of smoke, and she transformed into an ancestral tablet (位牌) inscribed "Spirit Tablet of Deceased Concubine, Madam Wang" (亡側媳王氏神位). Sok Saeng returned and was shocked beyond measure (驚愕莫措). Seeking divination (占) from a Daoist named Tonghyŏn (洞玄) (lit. 1 Daoist, 10 names), the Daoist (道士) said, "This woman's demonic peak (魔頂) is protected; she could not have died instantly. She has now fallen and is amidst perilous fortune (氣孛難中). After one year, you should be able to meet her again, but you just won't be able to renew the marital bond (姻緣)." Sok Saeng was half-believing, half-doubting (半信半疑), and from then on, was wretched day and night (日夜凄慘).

Who were those fierce bandits (豪賊)? They were sent by the jealous wife (妬婦), Kwan-che. Ch'oe Kyo - poisoned, lying unconscious (昏昏히 睡臥), her body was already in the Wuhsi government office (無錫官府). Using an antidote (解藥) to awaken her, where was this place (어대런가)? Kwan-shi's mother summoned her, toyed with her (簸弄), and in the course of words, even beatings occurred. Made to wear blue clothes (靑衣) and named Hwa No (花奴, Flower Slave), she was transformed into a servant (了頭). Here, there was an old woman (老婆) who was quite kind (厚) to Ch'oe Kyo. Ch'oe Kyo thus consoled herself (自慰), passing the months and years, attending (侍) Kwan Soje (官小姐, Young Miss Kwan) left and right, helping pass the time (消閑) by playing stringed instruments (彈絃). One day, there was a report that the young master (書房님) had returned. Arriving at the main hall (廳上) and stealing a glance (偸眼一瞥) - oh dear! The young master was Sok Saeng!

Chapter 15 is a good highlight (好脚色) of a tiresome scroll, and also good writing (好文辭). Ch'oe Kyo - at this point, understood the jealous wife's scheme. Kwan-che - calling repeatedly, came forward, went before Sok Saeng, and bowed. This part is lively in every sentence (句句皆活). Sok Saeng asked where she came from; Kwan-shi praised her skill with the *ho'gŭm* (胡琴), making Sok Saeng recall the supposedly dead Ch'oe Kyo in his thoughts (念頭). When Kwan-shi ordered Hwa No to lift her head (擧頭), Ch'oe Kyo responded at once (應聲一番), rose, and stood by the Young Miss's side (小姐의 身邊). Sok Saeng took one look (一眼看去) - what was her appearance (其狀)? Alas! (噫라) What is this? Fury (憤恨) pierced his marrow (骨髓), but it was a house where "the hen crows at dawn" (牝鷄司晨). Sok Saeng's worthlessness was like a pig or dog (豚犬), like a mud turtle (泥龜). Shedding tears (泪), he was caught by Kwan-shi. "It's nearing the mourning period (起服). Thinking of mother (母親), I couldn't help shedding tears" - reaching this point, one cannot help but feel pity (可憐). Enough! (已而오) A banquet (宴) was opened. Ch'oe Kyo, the Flower Slave, came forward to pour wine (酌). Ordered to play the *ho'gŭm*, she plucked it once and sang - a song of bitter resentment (痛恨詞).

My wretched fate landed me in a brothel (娼家). Married to a good man, truly rich and splendid. Amidst troupes in silk and gauze, pipes and songs alternated; In the kingfisher camp, music was extravagant. Buffeted by jealous rain, moored by the wind, Again towards the marquis's gate, I drift on a raft. Laughing or crying, I dare not act as if I exist; Joy and anger depend on others, I only ask them. Hearing the master was near, a thousand li away, Meeting again, it is indeed my old home. One is the elegant son-in-law in the seat of honor, One is the lowly servant girl (庸娃) in the kitchen. Four eyes meet, life force breaks; Two hearts reflect each other, death contends closely. Casually tuning the *ho'gŭm* to old grievances, Sorrowful! Today is truly lamentable (堪嗟). Sorrowful today! How displaced the position. Recalling old affairs! Beating time, sighing long. Meeting but not speaking! Liver and intestines want to break. When will we meet again! Flying together side by side.

Sok Saeng was vexed (煩悶) and could not rescue her; Ch'oe Kyo's heart was breaking (斷腸) and could not appeal. <114> Kwan-shi's state of delightedly enjoying herself alone (快然히 獨樂) - the author wields a marvelous brush (奇筆), entering a realm sweet as sugarcane (蔗境). The point where she intends to torture (拷問) her in front of Sok Saeng shows the shrew's (潑婦) violent nature (暴狀) to the utmost (至矣盡矣). However, the worthless Sok Saeng, henpecked by his wife, could only fold his hands (手を束する). Ch'oe Kyo finally begged (乞) to enter a temple and follow Buddha (入寺歸佛). Thus, she came to write sutras (經) in the Kwanŭm Pavilion (觀音閣) of the Sok family.

Chapter 16 narrates the writing of sutras in the Kwanŭm Pavilion. It depicts Sok Saeng's foolishness and ignorance (庸愚), Kwan-shi's tyranny (專橫), and Ch'oe Kyo's ill fate (薄命), leaving no regrets (遺憾). Sok Saeng stole a moment (閒을 偸하야) to meet Ch'oe Kyo and urged her to escape (脫走), instructing her to hide temporarily in a nunnery (尼寺). Ch'oe Kyo thus composed a verse (偈) and left.

Go, go, go, entrust to no-birth. Kick over the vinegar bottle (醋甁, jealousy), sever the ties of bitterness (蘖繫). The Tathagata's eighty-four thousand [dharmas], the Lion's Roar thirty-six times. Not by swift feet escaping for life, but again breaking the head covering in the Avici hell (無間室). Hee! Going is fun! One gourd, one bowl, wandering the ends of the earth (天涯), Unfettered, unrestrained, dwelling with the wind.

Finally, using a false name, she entered a nunnery called Choŭnam (招隱庵, Seeking Seclusion Hermitage). Disaster arises from within one's own walls (禍は蕭墻より起る). During the Ullambana festival (盂蘭盆会) at the hermitage, the matter of the gold bell and silver chime (金鐘銀磬), special treasures of the Sok family that Ch'oe Kyo had brought, almost exposed her true identity (本跡). At this point, Ch'oe Kyo told her life story (經歷) one by one to the abbess (庵主). The abbess, feeling pity (憫然), entrusted her to Madam Pak (薄媽媽). This wretch Madam Pak (薄媽媽這奴) was a wicked old woman (惡婆). Frequently stirring up rumors (風聲) to intimidate (威嚇) Ch'oe Kyo, she arranged for her to marry her nephew, Pak Haeng (薄倖, literally "faithless" or "unlucky"). At this point, Ch'oe Kyo regarded her body as if it were dung (糞土). The clarity of the source spring (源泉) was gone without a trace (跡), only the muddy stream (濁流) flowed turbidly (混混); integrity (操) and principle (節) were things she no longer knew. Circumstance (境遇) makes the person; even hating a speck of dust is talk for when one is clean. One who was once so pure (純潔) as she, now had become thus (如斯).

Pak Haeng was originally a flesh broker (肉經紀, pimp, lit. 'fellow who plays with women for food'). Ch'oe Kyo was deceived again. The author adds this plot development (搆想), which is extremely clumsy (拙劣). Ch'oe Kyo was sold again (再賣). However, unlike in the past, she merely resigned herself to fate (天運). The difference between before and after was thus; even the brothel life (娼家) was no longer shocking. People saw her and sought pleasure (歡); she used people to dispel boredom (興). Singing boisterously (豪歌) through the night, her name consequently became famous (遂振). Whether they were men of Qin (秦人), guests from Chu (楚客), guests from Wu (吳客), or people from Yue (越人), was not her concern. Who would say this was not the result of fate (運命) and circumstance? Now, one could not seek the clarity of the source spring from her; one could only see her as the muddy waves (濁浪) downstream. A man from Yue named Sŏ Myŏngsan (徐明山) was originally a hero (人傑) of his generation. Harboring dissatisfaction with the court (朝), he commanded a large army (大兵) and resisted (抗) the government troops (官兵). Ch'oe Kyo came to be recognized by him and was redeemed (贖身); good fortune (好運) finally caught Ch'oe Kyo.

Chapter 18 is Ch'oe Kyo's moment of triumph (得意の場), but conversely, it belongs to the great flaws (大瑕) of this work. Madam Wang Ch'oe Kyo bestows kindness (恩德) upon the people, and Sŏ Myŏngsan captures all of Ch'oe Kyo's <115> old friends and foes to show them their retribution (報). This part is nothing more than an arrangement designed to buy the reader's satisfaction (快哉), truly resembling child's play (兒戱). The flaw of didacticism (勸懲の弊) reaches its extreme here. Sok Saeng the coward (懦夫) is consistent from beginning to end - this is worth noting (可觀); the cruel punishments and rewards need not be detailed.

Sŏ Myŏngsan pressed the government troops hard. Envoys for surrender (招降の使) came frequently, but he scared them all away. However, the part where he finally ruins himself (身を誤る) by Ch'oe Kyo's words is the reason this chapter contains outstanding writing (出色文字).

The government army enticed (籠絡) Ch'oe Kyo. Ch'oe Kyo, with a woman's shallow heart (淺薄之心), fell for the sweet words (甘言) about petitioning the Son of Heaven (天子) to honor (旌獎) her as a Madam (夫人), bear glory (榮), return to her hometown (故里) for a family reunion (父子團圓), be ranked among the tripods (鼎) in life, and receive blood sacrifices (血食) in death. She earnestly advised (苦諫) Myŏngsan. "A woman's single word can ruin a family and state" (女子一言能亡家國). The ode says, "Glorious, glorious Zong Zhou, Bao Si destroyed it" (赫赫宗周、褒姒亡之). This hero Myŏngsan, who didn't even regard an army of a million (百萬) soldiers, was finally misled by the words of a common woman (一匹婦), fell meaninglessly into the enemy's trap (術中), and was killed. His final lament, "Madam, you have wronged me!" (夫人が我を誤る), how sorrowful (悽愴) it is! But the time was already late (時已晩矣). I can only pity (憐之) that his words were merely those of doubt (疑惑).

(Original Chinese text describing Sŏ Myŏngsan's death: Standing without falling for two *shichen* (four hours), no one dared approach. Sighs could still be heard. Retreating several tens of steps and seeing the corpse unmoving, they then knew he was truly dead. They immediately reported to the schemers Zhang and Xiong. The two generals saw this scene and ordered soldiers to push him. Like stone chiselled, like gold engraved, how could he be pushed over? Suddenly, Ch'oe Kyo was brought forward, surrounded by soldiers. Seeing Myŏngsan standing dead without falling, Ch'oe Kyo cried out, "He was a heroic warrior! Because I earnestly persuaded him to surrender, he did not meet a proper death. His resentful spirit (怨氣) has not dispersed, so though dead, he still stands, waiting for me to personally bow and console him." Facing the corpse, she bowed and prayed, "Great King (大王), I truly wronged you (妾寔悞儞). But I ultimately dare not live alone and betray the Great King's deep kindness (厚德)." Having spoken, she burst into loud wails. Sŏ Myŏngsan's standing corpse opened its eyes wide, tears fell like rain, and the corpse also immediately fell.)

Even after death, Myŏngsan was moved by a woman. A young woman's (兒女子) single drop of tear finally mocked (揶揄) the hero!

At the banquet rewarding the troops at the camp gate (轅門犒勞の宴), Ch'oe Kyo, following orders, played the *ho'gŭm* (胡琴). At this point, she too finally could not avoid becoming a courtesan (妓). The chaste wife (貞婦) of former days, once so fiery (烈烈), now lacked even three cents' worth (三文の值). Her benefactor (恩人) was dead, yet she could not commit suicide. Moreover, being forced (逼) to offer her body (身) to the supervising general (督軍), she was almost no different from a promiscuous woman (淫婦). Circumstance finally transformed the pitiful Ch'oe Kyo of former days into a common woman who regarded integrity (操) like worn-out shoes (弊履). Yet she still had half a point (半點) of shame (羞愧). When the supervising general gifted her to a military commander (軍長), she too thought the world heartless (無情). On the Qiantang River (錢塘江) bank one evening, hearing the tidal bore (潮信), knowing the place, she recalled Liu Tan-hsien's (劉淡仙) promise from 15 years prior, took up a brush, and wrote:

Fifteen years ago there was a promise, This morning I finally reach Qiantang. A hundred years of life, sparks from a fire; A lifetime's affairs, a yellow millet dream (黃梁). The tide's signal urges me to go; Idly, I put an end to this broken heart (斷腸).

Thereupon, she jumped (跳) into the river (江中), exactly like Lu Zhu shattering by the well (綠珠碎井時). <116>

Ch'oe Kyo's karmic debt (*債) was at this point paid in full (拂盡), and her tribulations (劫數) ended here. The author considers this the result of not dwelling on the small kindness of intimacy (狎昵) but prioritizing the great righteousness (大義) of the imperial court (朝廷). Ch'oe Kyo - revived (復活)!

The abbess of Choŭnam (招隱菴), while travelling (行脚), visited the nun Samhap To'go (三合道姑), learned the reason for the end of Ch'oe Kyo's tribulations (消劫), bought a hermitage by the Qiantang River (錢塘江邊), purchased a boat, and waited, finally rescuing (救濟) Ch'oe Kyo. Ch'oe Kyo - rescued, while in the boat cabin (艙中), unconscious (昏迷不醒), dimly saw Liu Tan-hsien. He said, "The sufferings of the past have already been endured completely, and today's tribulations are also finished (消完)."

Chapter 20 is the grand finale (大團圓). That Kim Chung (金重) had married Ch'oe Un (翠雲). However, he had not forgotten his past pledge (盟) to Ch'oe Kyo. By chance learning the details of Ch'oe Kyo's entire life history (事歷), he set up a spirit tablet (位牌) on the bank of the Qiantang River, offered three cups of wine (酒三盃), performed Song Yu's (宋玉) "Summons of the Soul" (招魂辭) as a memorial rite (祭). Thereupon he met the abbess, and thus met Ch'oe Kyo, and parents, younger brother, and younger sister all had a marvelous reunion (奇遇) in one hall (一堂). Ch'oe Kyo - finally yielding to earnest persuasion (苦勸), although renewing the old promise (舊約) with Kim Chung, she ultimately did not give herself (身) to him. With "flowers withered and moon waning" (花殘月缺), still arranging her weary face and thinning hair (緬顔殘鬂), to become a new bride (新人) and be matched with a gentleman (君子) - would I, your servant (妾), alone not feel shame in my heart? she asked. And added, if he absolutely insisted on a "new trial for the flowering crabapple" (海棠新試, i.e., consummating the marriage), that would be to disgrace (辱) her. She finally lived out her life as a widow with a husband (有夫の寡夫).

The author viewed her as a virtuous woman (烈女) throughout her life. However, the path by which circumstances made her fall from virtue is described in considerable detail (頗詳). Those who sell their charms (賣色輩) are often forced into such circumstances; seeing the circumstances and fate, I indeed cannot lack even half a drop of tears. However, upon reaching the stage of decline (墮落期), these people almost lose their conscience (良心); at this point, how can one seek pristine purity (潔皎皎) from them? It is acceptable (可) for gentlemen (士) of blood and tears in the world to express sympathy (同情) upon seeing the fate and circumstances of such people, but it is wrong (非) to imagine the trickling clarity (涓涓) of the source spring and seek it in the muddy confusion (混混) downstream. Recently, those who sell their charms often appear at the tip of scholars' (文士) pens, receiving much sympathy. Scholars advocating humanism (人道) - it is naturally so. However, I also cannot lack some degree of concern (念慮) regarding young readers (少年 讀者) whose thoughts are not yet settled (思想 未定).
(完) <117>

**Summary**

This article summarizes and comments on significant portions of the Vietnamese narrative poem "The Tale of Kiều" (presented here as the story of 金翠翹, Kim Ch'oe Kyo). It traces the heroine Ch'oe Kyo's tragic journey: forced into prostitution to save her father, enduring immense suffering and degradation, manipulated by deceitful characters like Sok Su and his jealous wife Kwan-che, finding brief respite and power with the rebel leader Sŏ Myŏngsan, inadvertently causing his downfall, and ultimately attempting suicide before being rescued and choosing a life of chaste companionship over remarriage. The author, Yang Paekhwa, concludes with a moral reflection, acknowledging the sympathy such tragic figures elicit but cautioning young readers against overly romanticizing or excusing the loss of virtue dictated by harsh circumstances, reflecting the complex societal attitudes of the time. From a historical perspective, the article's choice to retell a foreign tragedy involving female suffering, virtue, fate, and societal judgment in a Korean magazine during the colonial period is noteworthy. It might have served as an indirect way to explore themes of suffering under oppressive forces (analogous to colonial rule), the complexities of maintaining integrity in difficult times, and the societal constraints faced, particularly by women, resonating with contemporary Korean concerns without directly challenging Japanese censorship.

1. 金翠翹傳(續)
『(哭皇天) (意譯)』이내 八字 奇薄하야 집안이 결단나니 이 몸 팔아 아버님 救차 魔窟(火坑)에 떨어젓소. 일즉이 이 몸으로 죽는 것을 바랏나니, 이 노릇이 뭬 조하서, 人中之末되엇겟소. 奸人의 陷穽에가, 잘못하야 떨어지니 내 입이 열이라도 辯明할 길 全혀 업소. 들보에, 나를 달아, 매질은 무슨 일고, 全身이 肉醬이라. 죽엇다 살아낫소. 에그머니, 살려주오, 듯지를 안는구나, 百方으로 哀乞하니, 겨우 매질 그치고서, 억지로, 나로하야 誤入을 시키구료. 내 本是 良家女라, 손 달을 줄, 어이 알리, 처음부터 끗까지로, 가르치는 말, 듯고 보니 더럽기 限量업서, 사람이 죽겟구료. 枕席에서 周旋하는, 모든 秘術 배가지고, 밤마다 丹粧하고, 손시중 드는구나. 손님이 안 잘적엔, 敢히 자지 못하고서, 손님이 잠들며는 큰 기침도 못하누나. 幸혀 손님, 怪히 알가, 操心되어, 맘 못 노코, 또 손님 갈가보와, 一時 放心 못하누나. 손님은 無道하야 제 慾心만 채라드니, 저 할대로 맛겨두고, 承順만 하는구나. 낫익은 손님이면, 그래도 낫지마는, 初面의 손님들은, 더구나 어렵구나, 우악함을 계관 안코, 억지로 웃음 지어, 비위를 마추야네. 큰 어미 아는 것은, 다만 지 돈 뿐이라, 姸醜를 가리쟌코, 함부로 들이맛네. 고흔 꼿 츩덤불에 속절 업시 달려 잇고 美人은 할 일 업시, 天痴와 짝하도다. 입에서 惡臭난덜, 어떠케 내대이며, 몸에가 病 잇기로, 뉘 敢히 避할손가. 每日을 이와 가티, 지긋지긋 지내건만, 족음도 사정업시 따리고 또 따리며 그칠 줄을 모르는구나? 슯흐다, 살아서는, 千사람의 게집이요, 아차 한 번 죽어지면, 無主孤魂 되는구료. 人生 中 불상키는, 女子 몸이 으뜸이요, 女子 中에 불상키는, 娼妓몸 됨이로다. 남의 妻妾 되고보면, 主人은 잇것마는, 娼妓 한 번 되고보면 死生조차 모르겟네. 이것을 생각하니, 金瘡이 메지누나. 어화 靑樓 벗님네야, 이 내 말을 잇지 말고, 속속히 몸을 빼처, 魔窟(火坑)을 벗어나서, 다른 날 내 門前에, 鞍馬 업서 冷落할 제, 空然히 西風압헤, 눈물 지어 울지 마소.
翠翹-이미 火坑(魔窟)에 墜落하니 艶名이 巷里에＜110＞ 喧喧이라. 그러나 彼-苦界에 入하야 日이 尙淺이라. 想來에 怨恨이 업지 못할 새 마츰내 結하야 이 『哭皇天』 一章이 되니 비록 그 詞는 巧라 못하겟스나 그 意는 悽愴하도다. 胡琴에 合하야 이를 彈하니 聽者-皆垂淚라.
翠翹-꼿 아츰 달 저녁에 萬般 嬌態로 客을 對함을 보고 이를 바라만 볼 것이 아니라 아츰 我有를 맨들어 金屋에 置코자 하는 人이 만흔 中에 無錫縣의 人, 束守라 하는 자-그 父親을 從하야 此地에 遊라. 鄕에 在하야 吏部天官의 女, 官氏를 娶하니 美하고 且慧라. 그러나 그 心性은 奸하고 曲한데 그 才의 敏함은 이를 能히 掩飾하야 돌이어 體面을 채리니 到底히 그 夫의 及할 배 아니라. 이는 眞 所謂 牝鷄司晨이요 束守에 이르러는 無氣力하고 용해 빠진 書房님에 不過한 爲人이라. 一次 翠翹와 相遇한 後로부터 用金을 如水하다가 마츰내 至是하야 置家할 議論을 하게 되도다. 此處의 翠翹의 談話는 前日과 갓지 아님을 볼 수 잇스니 馬媽 傳來의 秘術을 잘 活用함을 알겟스며 第11回는 此間의 消息을 말하도다.
第12回는 翠翹를 떼어 들이는 顚末을 敍하얏스니 末段에 束守가 其父에게 怒한 배 되어 遂也知府에게 被訴라. 그러나 知府의 風流 裁判은 翠翹에게 即席의 一題를 命하고 眞是佳人이니 宜配君子라 길이 夫婦를 作하라는 斷案을 下함으로 以了하얏도다.
體面을 보랴하는 性情이 官姐(束守의 妻)로 하야금 人이 娶妾의 說을 傳함을 禁케 하도다. 그러나 嫉妬는 婦人의 特性이라. 心理에 自然 悶悶함을 不免이요 翠翹인덜 어찌 이를 不知하랴. 郎君의 忠厚沈潛함이 恐컨대 智多星의 對手가 아니라 看破하도다. 저- 용해빠진 束守와 如함은 못나기 짝 업도다. 彼와 我-恩愛相投하야 結婚 以後 이때껏 마츰내 半辭의 逆言이 업스나 그러나 내가 實로 이를 畏하기 虎와 如하며 그 擧止가 端嚴하야 事를 구차히 아니하니 神明을 如見이라. 故로 放肆치 아니할 뿐이라 하도다. 彼가 그 妻를 畏함이 如斯하야 그 娶妾한 事에 至하야는 다만 그 知함을 恐하니 이 何等庸物인가. 그러나 天下에 如斯한 者-多하도다. 此에 至하야 그 妻를 歸省하게 되니 이제 翠翹 掌裡의 物인 庸物은 暫離를 不願하도다. 多한 즉 半 年이요 少한 즉 3月이라. 1年은 必留하라. 翠翹가 勸하는 말에 肝腸이 亦斷이라고 泣顔함도 可笑로다. 翠翹의 今夕何夕 10首에 至하야는 可觀할 것이 有하도다.
今夕是何夕, 郞君賦遠遊, 妾在家中頻記日, 問君何日再回頭.
今夕是何夕, 情傷惜別離, 一曲驪歌兩行泪, 送君明月出陽關.＜111＞
今夕是何夕, 傷別不成歡, 無端鐵馬風飜驟, 驚散離魂就枕難.
今夕是何夕, 明朝各一天, 瞻望復關何處是, 愛而不見涕漣漣.
今夕是何夕, 月圓人且離, 兩地江山萬餘里, 不知何日見歸期.
今夕是何夕, 相對難爲言, 忽聞天半孤鴻淚, 似訴離情話未安.
今夕是何夕, 醉飮不忘悲, 人道解悲須是酒, 酒入儂腸愁更催.
今夕是何夕, 强咲媚良人, 怕郞憔悴因儂病, 惜郞勞苦慰郞心.
今夕是何夕, 生離共死別, 死別能期會九原, 生離兩地惟啼血.
離別의 情을 各樣으로 敍來하야 此曲의 前半은 자못 有趣라. 翠翹의 慧才와 束守의 庸劣을 相配하야 奇彩를 이루니 今宵共宿芙蓉帳이나 明日棲其可奈何오(束守)流水未乾客未老하니 他年依舊架銀河라(翠翹)는 應對의 邊은 文辭가 妙絶하도다.
此回의 後半은 또한 官姐의 慧才와 束守의 庸劣을 相配하야 奇彩를 放하니 前半은 離요 後半은 合이라.
束生은 原來 어리 백이라 歸家하야 妻가 娶妾을 不知함과 如히 舅姑를 訪하고 一言 娶妾의 事가 無함에 安하야 兩家가 不聞과 如함을 暗喜하고 잇다가 一棒으로 急所를 被打한 것도 實로 噴飯하기에 足하도다. 자- 試譯하야 볼가.
어느날 저녁 때이엇다. 안해가 이러한 말을 하얏다. 하마하더면 남에게 속을번 하얏다오. 요 前에 束芻란 녀석이 臨淄에서 돌아오더니 아마 임자가 妓生가튼 것을 불러서 술 잡숫는 것을 보앗나 보아요. 임자가 妾置家를 하얏다고 떠들겟지요. 어떠케 얄미운지요. 그래서 내 말이 書房님과 나와는 彼此에 속이지 안코 지내는 터에 그런 다갱이를 감추고 꽁문이 들어내어 놋는 짓을 하실 리가 잇느냐 하고. 어떠케도 괘심스러온지요. 여보서요 좀 되지만 누구를 식히여 그 녀석의 니를 네 개를 빼 주웟지요. 그런 後부터는 그런 말 하는 者가 일절 업세요. 全혀 그것은 임자가 妓生을 불러 藥酒를 잡수신 일이 아마 게신 줄 모다 알아요. 여보서요 그래 내가 한 일이 잘못하지는 안핫지요.
束生은 낫을 붉히엇다. 마치 궁둥이가 자리에 붓지 앗는 듯이 허둥허둥 하며 간신히 이러케 對答하얏다. 妓生을 부르는 것은 交際 上에 或 잇는 일이라 할지라도 그래 妾을 두면 그 말이 자네 귀에 안들어갈 터인가. 해해...＜112＞ 그래 그런 줄 알아요. 고만두셔요.
日月은 如梭라 어느덧 1年은 꿈가티 지나가매 束守는 배에 올라 臨淄로 向하야 가니 官姐는 스스로 一個의 妙計가 有하도다.
束生未去, 我欲擒那婢子來, 取他的氣, 又恐耽妬婦惡名, 傷夫婦和氣, 所以佯爲不知耳. 他今日去了, 我欲定一策, 拿來做了了頭, 只說見爹爹計與我的, 呌束生回來, 一堂聚首, 他認又認不得, 說又說不出, 在我拔去眼中釘, 而無女平章之名, 在他受飢狸鼠之愚, 而甘爲妾婦之羞, 分遂此衷.
嫉妬의 一念은 玆에 이 慘刑을 案出하도다. 翠翹의 身上에 또한 一大棒을 喝來라.
英雄도 難을 遇하야 往往 身을 喪하나니 何況 翠翹는 一女子라. 豪奴에게 被劫盜來하야 그 慘禍를 受함을 또한 어찌 足히 奇하다 하리요. 홀로이 嚴嚴한 大臣은 國을 爲함으로 民을 憂하야 一物이라도 其所를 엇지 못함을 恐하나니 이에 妻女를 家에 縱케 하야 豪奴를 指揮하며 이 不公不法한 事를 幹하니 是何心고 不知하고 此를 爲할진대 家를 齊키 不能하거늘 어찌 能히 國을 治하며 알고도 짐짓 縱케 하니 더욱 不可하도다. 嗟乎라. 大都勢位를 釀成하야 不覺不察하니 由是觀之컨대 天下의 寃屈을 無伸이요 痛苦를 無訴니 홀로 一翠翹뿐 아니로다. 어찌 人으로 하야금 浩歎치 안흐리요. 歎은 則 歎이나 實로 翠翹를 爲하야 歎함이 아니요 世道人心을 爲하야 歎하노라 함은 이것이 第14回의 外書에 聖歎이 痛歎한 바니 所謂他의 酒杯를 借하야 自家의 磊塊를 澆한 것이로다. 翠翹-束生이 去한 後에 思念은 彼를 懷하야 詠한 것이 自君之出矣의 6絶이라.
自君之出矣, 日日望靑鸞, 靑鸞望不至, 徒見白雲端,
自君之出矣, 不敢上高樓, 樓外有楊柳, 絲絲會惹愁,
自君之出矣, 不言亦不哭, 言則無知音, 哭恐驚郞寤,
自君之出矣, 張燈頻顧影, 顧影自徘徊, 消瘦可憐憫,
自君之出矣, 厭日照空床, 薄衾不成寐, 孤枕怕嚴霜,
自君之出矣, 無日不南思, 思君君不至, 淚滴滿羅裙,
此夜 園中에 至하야 香을 燒하며 衷情을 口占하는데 花陰下에 突如히 十數介의 壯丁을 現하야 翠翹를 綁하야 口에 毒을 投하고 다시 其屋에 放火하야 翠翹를 推하야 中堂에＜113＞ 入함과 가티 擬하고 馬를 乘하고 一陣의 陰風과 가티 자취를 감추웟도다. 隣里火를 救하다가 燼中에 一個의 屍體를 見호라. 衆人이 憐之하야 이에 茶毘一片의 煙으로 化하고 亡側媳王氏神位의 位牌로 變하얏도다. 束生이 歸來하야 驚愕莫措라. 1道 10名은 洞玄이라는 者에게 占케 하니 道士 云호되 此婦魔頂保重이라 아즉 卽死치 못하고 이제 落하야 氣孛難中에 在하니 1年 後에 맛당히 相見함을 得할 것이나 다만 姻緣을 다시 續키 不能할 뿐이라 하도다. 束生은 半信半疑하야 自此로 日夜凄慘이라.
彼 豪賊은 어떠한 者인고. 妬婦官姐의 보낸 배라. 翠翹-毒에 中하야 昏昏히 睡臥하는 間에 이미 身은 無錫官府중에 在하도다. 解藥을 用하야 醒來하니 여긔가 어대런가. 官氏의 母가 이를 召하야 이를 簸弄하고 言餘에 매질까지 나도다. 靑衣를 着케 하고 花奴라 命名하야 一個의 了頭로 化라. 此間에 一個의 老婆가 有가야 자못 翠翹에게 厚하거늘 翠翹-因此 自慰하야 歲月을 보내며 官小姐의 左右에 侍하야 彈絃으로써 消閑의 用을 助하도다. 一日報잇서 書房님이 歸來하얏다 하거늘 廳上에 到하야 偸眼一瞥하니 아이구나 書房님은 束生이로구나.
第15回는 厭卷의 好脚色이요 또한 好文辭라. 翠翹-至此하야 妬婦의 計策임을 曉하도다. 官姐-連呼함으로써 進하야 束生의 前에 至하야 拜하니 此處는 句句皆活이라. 束生은 那邊으로부터 來함을 問하며 官氏는 胡琴의 能함을 稱하야 束生으로하야금 念頭에 死한 翠翹를 다시 想케 하도다. 官氏가 花奴에게 擧頭함을 命할 時에 翠翹-應聲一番에 起來하야 小姐의 身邊에 在하거늘 束生이 一眼看去에 其狀이 如何오. 噫라. 是何事오. 憤恨이 骨髓에 徹하나 牝鷄司晨의 家요 束生의 못남은 豚犬과 如하고 泥龜와 如하야 泪를 流하다가 官氏에게 들키어 起服이 在近이라. 念及母親에 不覺泪下라는 邊에 至하야는 돌이어 可憐함을 不禁하겟도다. 已而오. 宴을 開하매 翠翹의 花奴-進來하야 酌하거늘 胡琴을 命하매 撥一撥에 歌唱하니 一曲의 痛恨詞로다.
妾身薄命落娼家, 嫁得良人寔富華, 綺羅隊裡笙歌迭, 翡翠營中音律奢, 迍邅妬雨隨風泊, 又向侯門寄浪槎, 咲啼不敢如無我, 喜怒由人只問他, 聞道主翁千里近, 相逢却是舊儂家, 一爲座上風流婿, 一爲廚下小庸娃, 四目相看生氣斷, 兩心相炤死爭些, 漫把胡琴調舊怨, 悲哉今日寔堪嗟, 悲今日兮, 位次何迂, 懷舊事兮, 按拍長吁, 相逢不語兮, 肝腸欲斷, 何時重會兮, 雙雙同飛,
束生은 煩悶하며 救不得이요 翠翹는 斷腸하며 告不得이언만＜114＞ 官氏-快然히 獨樂하는 狀은 作者-奇筆을 弄하야 蔗境에 入하얏도다. 束生의 面前에서 拷問코자 하는 處는 潑婦의 暴狀이 至矣盡矣로다. 然하나 못나고 안해에게 굽쥐어지 내는 束生은 手를 束할 뿐이라. 翠翹-듸디어 入寺歸佛함을 乞하니 이에 束家의 觀音閣에 入하야 經을 寫하게 되도다.
第16回는 即 觀音閣上에 寫經함을 敍하니 束生의 庸愚함과 官氏의 專橫함과 翠翹의 薄命함을 描來하야 遺憾이 無하도다. 束生이 閒을 偸하야 翠翹를 遇하고 玆에 脫走를 勸하야 尼寺에 暫隱함을 敎하니 翠敎-이에 一偈를 題了하고 去하도다.
去去去, 無生寄, 踢倒醋甁, 址斷蘖繫, 如來八萬四千, 獅吼三十六度, 不是脚快得逃生, 又破頭套無間室, 咦去得趣, 一瓢一鉢蕩天涯, 無拘無束隨風住.
마츰내 僞稱하고 招隱庵이라 하는 尼寺로 入하얏도다. 禍는 蕭墻에서 起하도다. 庵中盂闌大會의 時에 翠翹-齎來한 束家特藏의 金鐘銀磬의 事로부터 하마 翠翹의 本跡이 綻露에 至한지라 至是하야 翠翹 ― 一一이 自家의 經歷을 庵主에게 告하니 庵主 ― 憫然하야 이를 薄媽媽에게 托하도다. 薄媽媽這奴는 一個의 惡婆라. 頻頻이 風聲을 作하야써 翠翹를 威嚇하야 其姪薄倖에게 嫁케 하니 此에 至하야 翠翹는 其身을 見하기 마치 糞土와 如하도다. 源泉의 淸은 去하야 跡이 無하고 오즉 濁流가 混混할 뿐이니 操와 節은 그 知하는 배 아니로다. 境遇는 人을 作하나니 한낫의 틔끌도 이를 실혀함은 깨끗할 때의 말이라. 純潔이 일즉이 如彼하던 者-今에는 如斯하도다.
薄倖은 原來 肉經紀(게집 놀리어 먹는 놈)라. 翠翹는 또 속앗도다. 作者-이에 또 이 搆想을 가하니 拙劣이 極이라. 翠翹-再賣되도다. 그러나 往日과 갓지 아니하고 오즉 天運에 任할 뿐이라. 前後의 相異가 如斯하니 娼家도 足히 놀날 것이 못되도다. 人은 彼를 見하고 歡을 求하며 彼는 人을 借하야 興을 遣하도다. 豪歌-夜를 徹하야 其名이 遂振이라. 秦人이나 楚客이나 吳客이나 越人은 彼의 問하는 배 아니라. 누가 이로써 運命과 境遇의 所致가 아니라 하리요. 今에는 源泉의 淸한 것으로써 彼에게 求치 못할 것이요 下流의 濁浪으로써 彼를 見할 뿐이로다. 越人 徐明山이라는 者는 월래 一世의 人傑이라 朝에 不平을 抱하고 大兵을 擁하야 官兵에게 抗하도다. 翠翹-그의 識한 배 되야 贖身이 되니 好運이 마츰내 翠翹를 捉하도다.
第18回는 翠翹 得意의 場인데 돌이어 此作의 大瑕에 屬하도다. 王夫人 翠翹는 民에 恩德을 施하고 徐明山은 翠翹의＜115＞ 舊恩怨을 盡捉來하야 其報를 示하는 處는 讀者의 快哉를 買키 爲하야 設함에 不外하니 實로 兒戱에 類하도다. 勸懲의 弊-於斯에 極矣라. 束生 懦夫終始一貫하니 此-可觀이오  그 慘刑報德은 須不必說이로다.
徐明山이 官兵을 困케 하니 招降의 使-頻頻而來하나 盡嚇以還케 하도다. 그러나 마츰내 翠翹의 言에 身을 誤하는 處는 이 次回의 出色文字된 所以라.
官軍은 翠翹를 籠絡하니 翠翹는 女子의 淺薄之心에 天子에게 奏하야써 夫人을 旌獎하야 榮을 荷하고 故里에 歸省하야 父子團圓하고 生하야는 鼎에 列하고 死하야는 血食케 한다는 甘言에 떨어저 明山을 苦諫하니 女子 一言에 能亡家國이라 詩에 云호되 赫赫宗周, 褒似亡之라 하니 明山這個의 豪傑로 百萬의 兵도 眼中에 置치 안턴 者-마츰내 一匹婦의 言에 誤한 배 되어 하잘 것 업시 敵의 術中에 陷하야 被殺할 새 夫人이 誤我로다 한 末期의 嘆息은 何其悽愴한고. 그러나 時已晩矣라. 余는 그 한갓 疑惑의 言임을 憐之할 뿐이라.
立而不仆, 兩个時辰, 諸方敢近前, 猶聞嘆聲, 退步數十步, 見尸不動, 然後知其眞死, 卽報陰謀張熊, 二將見此光景, 令軍人推之, 如石鑿成, 如金鏤就, 那里推得倒, 忽翠翹爲諸軍擁至, 見明山死立不仆, 翠翹哭道, 彼英雄士也, 因妾苦勸歸降, 不得其死, 怨氣不散, 故雖死猶立, 待妾親拜慰之, 對死屍拜祝道, 大王, 妾寔悞儞, 然終不敢獨生以辜大王厚德, 說畢, 放聲大哭, 徐明山立的屍首, 把眼一睜, 泪如雨落, 屍亦隨仆,
明山은 死後에도 오히려 一婦에게 動한 배 되도다. 兒女子의 一滴의 淚가 마츰내 豪傑을 揶揄了하는구나.
轅門犒勞의 宴에 翠翹-命에 依하야 胡琴을 彈하니 此에 至하야 彼亦 마츰내 妓됨을 不免하도다. 往日에 烈烈하던 貞婦 今에는 三文의 値도 無하고 녀 恩人은 死하얏거늘 自殺치 못하고 하물며 逼한 배 되어 身으로써 督軍에게 許함과 如함에 至하야는 거의 淫婦와 다를 것이 업스니 경우는 마츰내 往日의 可憐한 翠翹로 하야곰 操를 見하기 弊履와 如한 一匹婦로 化케 하도다. 그러나 彼 오히려 半點의 羞愧가 잇스니 督軍이 이를 軍長에게 賜함에 彼도 世를 無情히 생각하얏도다. 錢塘江上의 夕에 潮信를 聽하고 其地임을 知하고는 劉淡仙 15年 前의 約을 思하고 筆을 취하야 題하야 曰
十五年前有約, 今朝方到錢塘, 百歲光陰火爍, 一生身事黃梁, 潮信催人去也, 等閑了却斷腸
이에 身을 跳하야 江中에 入하니 正是 綠珠碎井時라.＜116＞
翠翹의 *債는 此에 至하야 拂盡하고 劫數-此에 消하도다. 作者-以爲하되 狎昵의 小恩을 不念하고 朝廷의 大義를 重히 한 所致라 하도다. 翠翹-復活이라.
招隱菴의 菴主-行脚하다가 三合道姑를 訪하야 翠翹消劫의 故를 知하고 錢塘江邊에 菴을 購하고 買船以待하다가 마츰내 翠翹를 救濟하도다. 翠翹-救助되어 艙中에 在할 새 昏迷不醒時에 恍然히 劉淡仙을 見호라. 云호되 從前의 苦는 이미 歷盡하고 今日의 劫은 또한 消完이라 하도다.
第20回는 大團圓이니 彼金重은 翠雲과 婚하얏도다. 그러나 翠翹의 往日盟을 不忘이라. 偶然히 翠翹一生의 事歷을 詳知하고 錢塘江上에 位牌를 設하야 酒三盃를 奠하고 宋玉의 招魂辭를 하야 이를 祭하니 이에 庵主를 遇하고 이에 翠翹와 會하야 父母 弟妹가 모다 一堂에 奇遇하도다. 翠翹- 마츰내 苦勸을 逢하야 다시 金重과 비록 舊約을 續하얏스나 彼는 마츰내 金重에게 身을 許치 아니하도다. 花殘月缺에 오히려 緬顔殘鬂을 撩하야 新人이 되어써 君子에게 配코자 함은 妾이 홀로 마음에 愧치 아니랴 하며 又謂하되 만일 반듯이 海棠新試를 作할진대 곳 이는 妾을 辱되게 함이라 하고 彼는 마츰내 有夫의 寡夫로 其身을 以終하얏도다.
作者는 彼를 一生 烈女로써 觀하얏도다. 그러나 境遇가 彼로 하야금 烈女로서 墮落한 徑路를 寫來하야 頗詳하도다. 彼 賣色輩가 흔히 如斯한 境遇에 逼한 배 되나니 境遇와 運命을 見하면 余-마츰내 半點의 淚가 可히 無치 못하도다. 그러나 그 墮落期에 至하야는 彼輩-거의 良心을 失하나니 至此하야 어찌 彼輩에게 向하야 潔皎皎함을 可히 求할 수 잇스리요. 天下의 有血有淚한 士가 彼輩의 運命과 境遇를 보고 同情을 表함은 可요 만일 그 源泉의 涓涓함을 想하야 此를 下流의 混混함에 求함은 非니 近來 賣色의 輩가 往往히 文士의 筆端에 現來하야 만흔 同情을 밧도다. 文士-人道를 唱하얀 固如斯할지라. 그러나 余-또한 彼思想 未定한 少年 讀者에 對하야 多少의 念慮가 無치 못호라.
