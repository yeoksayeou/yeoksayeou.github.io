A Few Things I've Felt
						抱石

What exactly is the standard for the word "inspiration" (感激)? Usually, it refers to feelings heightened beyond ordinary emotion, but to what degree must they be heightened to be called "inspiration"? Or does it only refer to reaching a state of so-called "ecstasy"?
In any case, let me jot down a few things here, taking the standard as being feelings that have risen quite a bit above the baseline of emotion.

It seems it was before I was ten. One day, my mother was reading the novel "Chang Paek Chŏn" (張白傳), which was commonly read in households at the time. I listened beside her late into the night, and the story of the protagonist, Chang Paek, losing his parents at a young age, being separated from his only sister, and becoming unable to ever meet her again (though they did meet after he grew up) deeply affected (솟치못하얏섯다) my young heart. For a long time afterward, whenever I thought about it, a chill went through my chest.

Then, it must have been when I was fourteen or fifteen, during my elementary school days. It was right around the time of the Japanese Annexation, and a school teacher gave an impassioned speech to the students. I was moved and wept along with several other students. After returning home, just as the teacher had done, I gave a speech to my family members, making my mother and sister cry, and I cried myself. Although this didn't stem from any deep consciousness, the sadness was poignant enough that I can still recall it now.

After that, during the several years I spent at home doing nothing after quitting middle school, I tried to read things like books. However, at that time, my social awareness and knowledge were quite narrow, so I couldn't find or even know about many books concerning the so-called new culture (at that time, I did read quite a few of the cheap domestic novels (갑업는 家庭小說) by writers like Yi Hae-jo and Yi In-jik＜21＞). Then, I read with no small amount of novelty the serial novels in the newspaper, said to be the first works by those considered writers in Korea. Also, sometime during those days, I avidly read the serialized translated novel "Ŭi Mujŏng" (噫無情 - Les Misérables, likely translated by Min U-bo) in the newspaper. When I reached the very end, where the protagonist Chang P'al-ch'an (the adapted name at that time) loses his only love Kosŏltto (also an adapted name) to his rival and suffers alone, I felt my heart ache intensely. At that time, evening came, and the voices of family members urging me to eat dinner were annoying, so I took the newspaper I was reading and went up the back hill. I found a spot where the snow had melted on the lawn, sat down, and, oblivious to the cold, read the end of the novel before coming back down. It seems this was the first time I was deeply moved by a work of literature. And so, the humanitarian spirit of this Hugo came to dominate my thought and emotions to a certain, clearly defined (料量宗定한) extent.

When I first went to Japan, there was also a time when my passion briefly flared for the social thought that was fashionable for a while then. However, this was not because I myself possessed a well-grounded ideological background, nor did such consciousness arise from my living environment; it merely stemmed from a shallow and vague humanitarian tendency, so that passion soon died down.

Having only heard the word "love," as someone well over twenty, I belatedly got caught by the glance (눈에 걸녀들어) of a Japanese girl next door, and my face flushed and my heart pounded – this was also something I experienced for the first time.
Among others' works, when reading Dostoevsky's (스토예푸스키) "Crime and Punishment" (罪와罰), upon reaching the part where Raskolnikov (라스콜니코푸) bows down before Sonya (소니야), saying, "I kneel before all the suffering of mankind," I felt intensely moved (혹하도록 感激하야보앗고). After reading Turgenev's (투르게니에푸) works like "Spring Torrents" (봄물결) or "On the Eve" (그전날밤), I felt unsettled (좃치못하얏섯다). Among the works I supposedly wrote myself, when writing the poem titled "On the Spring Lawn" (봄잔듸밧우에), the emotion within the poem surged to its highest level and lasted the longest, with its aftereffects rippling out for two or three days – this too was a first experience for me in writing.
These are all rather unremarkable experiences.

**Summary**

The author, Po Sŏk, reflects on several moments of intense emotion or "inspiration" (感激) throughout his life. These include childhood sadness from a novel, youthful patriotic tears stirred by a teacher's speech during the Japanese Annexation, the profound impact of reading Victor Hugo's "Les Misérables" (in translation), a fleeting engagement with social thought in Japan, a first experience of romantic attraction, and deep literary responses to Dostoevsky, Turgenev, and his own poetry writing. The essay traces the development of his emotional and intellectual sensitivity through personal experiences and encounters with literature and ideas. From a historical perspective, the article offers insight into the cultural consumption of a young Korean intellectual during the colonial period, showing the influence of both traditional Korean narratives, early modern Korean writers (Yi Hae-jo, Yi In-jik), Western literature in translation (Hugo, Dostoevsky, Turgenev), and the nascent political consciousness sparked by events like the Annexation. The mention of reading early Korean novelists and translated Western classics highlights the literary landscape available at the time, while the brief engagement with "social thought" in Japan hints at the intellectual currents attracting young Koreans seeking new ideas.

感激이란말을 엇더케 標準대고하는말인지 普通은 感情보다 더 高調로 는 感情을가지고 말하라는 어느 程度지 標準으로삼어 感激이라고하는지 는 所謂「엑스타지」에지경에이르는것만을 感激이라고하는지?
左右間 여긔서는 感情의 水平線에서 좀놉히엿다는 것을 標準삼어 맷가지 죽-적어보자.
