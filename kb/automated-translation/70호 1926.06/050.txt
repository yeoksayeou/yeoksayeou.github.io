(This piece, due to circumstances, has been postponed to the next issue.) <53>

**Summary**

This entry announces that the scheduled article titled "Literati Purges and Factional Strife" (士禍와 黨爭) by the author known as Sŏngdong Hagin (城東學人) has been postponed to the subsequent issue of the magazine *Kaebyŏk* due to unspecified circumstances. For historians, this brief note is interesting as it reflects the practical constraints (like space limitations or possibly censorship issues, though "circumstances" is vague) faced by Korean publications during the colonial period. The chosen topic itself, analyzing historical political strife in the Joseon Dynasty, was a common theme as intellectuals sought to understand Korea's past weaknesses or draw contemporary parallels.
