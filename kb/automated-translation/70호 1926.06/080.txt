Records for Political Reflection

雪梅有香
Snow Plum Has Fragrance

At King T'aejo's state banquet celebrating the founding of the dynasty, a kisaeng named Sŏlmae was serving drinks. The Chief State Councilor, Pae Kŭngnyŏm, teasingly said, "Kisaeng originally have many lovers (lit., Chang Sam and Yi Sa are all their husbands). How about offering your pillow (薦枕) to me tonight?" Sŏlmae replied, "What difference would it make if a kisaeng, who becomes Mister Chang's wife and Mister Yi's mistress, were to offer her pillow to a State Councilor who served the Wang clan and now serves the Yi clan?" Kŭngnyŏm, blushing deeply, changed color and excused himself from his seat.

The Six Living Martyrs and the Six Dead Martyrs
After King Tanjong's dethronement, six men – Pak P'aengnyŏn (pen name Chwiamhŏn), Ha Wiji (pen name T'angye), Sŏng Sammun (pen name Maejukhŏn), Yu Ŭngbu (pen name Pyŏngnyang), Yi Kae (pen name Paegokhŏn), and Yu Sŏngwŏn (pen name Nanggwan) – plotted for his restoration but died for their principles, hence they are called the Six Dead Martyrs (死六臣). Six other men – Kim Sisŭp (pen name Maewŏltang), Nam Hyo'on (pen name Ch'ugang), Cho Yŏ (pen name Ŏgye), Wŏn Ho (pen name Kwanran), Yi Ikjŏn (pen name Kyŏngŭn), and Sŏng Tamsu (pen name Mundu) – secluded themselves from the world to uphold their principles, hence they are called the Six Living Martyrs (生六臣). (*The original text has 成聘壽 but this is commonly known as 成聃壽 [Sŏng Tamsu] with pen name 文斗 [Mundu]).

Sukchu Sprouts
Mung bean sprouts are commonly called "Sukchu namul" (叔舟나물). The origin of this term comes from Sin Sukchu. Originally, along with the Six Martyrs, he received the dying command (顧命의 托) of King Munjong and served the young King Tanjong. However, he later assisted King Sejo in usurping the throne. Because his yielding nature and lack of principle were seen as resembling mung bean sprouts (菉豆菜), this nickname was given and eventually became the common name. Initially, when Sejo took the throne and Sukchu attended court, Sukchu's wife believed he would surely die for his principles and resolved to die for her principles as well. Staying at home, she awaited news of her husband's death. But Sukchu returned home in a grand carriage drawn by four horses, full of authority and prestige. His wife, finding this strange, asked for the reason. Sukchu said, "Though the great principle (大節) is important, what could be done when there is someone connected inside (入龍)?" (This was said because Sukchu had connections inside at the time). His wife, angered, spat in his face.

The Three Great Victories of the Imjin War
During the Imjin War [1592-1598], Admiral Yi Sunsin (posthumous title Ch'ungmugong) achieved a great victory over the enemy at Hansan Island; Kwŏn Yul won a great victory at Haengju; and Yi Chŏngam won a great victory at Yŏnan. These are collectively called the Three Great Victories of the Imjin War (壬辰三大捷).

The Three Scholars and the Seven Loyalists
During the Byeongja Horan [Manchu invasion of 1636], the three scholars Hong Ik'an, O Talje, and Yun Chip strongly advocated resisting reconciliation [with the Qing]. They were captured by the Qing state and taken to Shenyang (瀋陽), where they died upholding their principles without yielding. Thus, they are called the Three Scholars of the Byeongja Incident (丙亂三學士). Ch'oe Hyoil, An Kŭksŏng, Hwang Ilho, Ch'a Ch'ungnyang, Ch'a Wŏnch'ŏl, and Ch'a Maeng'yun (*Note: Missing one name for seven, traditionally includes Kim Sang'hŏn's servant Nach'ŏn), seeking to avenge the shame of the Byeongja year, conspired with the Ming state to attack the Qing dynasty. When the plan was exposed, they died for their principles together in prison, hence they are called the Seven Loyalists (七義士). (*The text appears to be missing a name or has an error, as it lists six names for the Seven Loyalists).

The Four Noron Ministers and the Four Soron Ministers
During the literati purges of the Sinch'uk and Imin years [1721-1722] in King Kyŏngjong's reign, the four men who were purged – Kim Ch'angjip, Yi Imyŏng, Yi Kŏnmyŏng, and Cho T'aech'ae – are called the Four Noron Ministers (老論四大臣). The four men who were appointed at that time – Cho T'aegu, Cho T'aeŏk, Yi Kwangjwa, and Yu Ponghwi – are called the Four Soron Ministers (少論四大臣).

The Origin of Sedo (In-law Politics/Power Monopoly)
When King Chŏngjo was the Crown Prince, Hong Inhan, Chŏng Hugyŏm, and others sought to harm him. At that time, palace officials Hong Kugyŏng and Yi Chinhyŏng protected him with utmost effort. Therefore, after King Chŏngjo ascended the throne, remembering their service, he appointed Kugyŏng as the Commander of the Royal Guard (宿衛所大將) and subsequently granted him political power, calling this "Sedo" (世道). This was its beginning.

The Five-Article Treaty and the Seven-Article Treaty
The Eulsa Japan-Korea Protectorate Treaty (乙巳日韓保護條約) consisted of five articles, and the Kyŏngsul Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty (庚戌日韓合倂條約) consisted of seven articles. Therefore, the former is simply called the Five-Article Treaty (五條約), and the latter is called the Seven-Article Treaty (七條約).

The Seven O's and the Five O's

Regarding the Japan-Korea Protectorate Treaty, Minister of State Pak Chesun, Minister of Education Yi Wanyong, Minister of Home Affairs Yi Chiyong, Minister of War Yi Kŭnt'aek, and Minister of Agriculture and Commerce Kwŏn Chunghyŏn consented and affixed their seals, hence they are called the Seven O's (七O). Regarding the Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty, Prime Minister Yi Wanyong, Minister of Home Affairs Pak Chesun, Minister of Finance Ko Yŏnghŭi, Minister of Agriculture and Commerce Cho Chungŭng, and Minister of Education Yi Yongsik agreed and affixed their seals, hence they are called the Five O's (五O). Adding Song Pyŏngjun to this group, they are also called the Six O's (六O). (*Note: "O" (O) is likely a substitution for 賊 [chŏk/zoku], meaning traitor/bandit, thus referring to the "Seven Traitors" and "Five Traitors" of Eulsa and Kyŏngsul respectively. The count for the Eulsa Treaty is usually five, not seven as stated here; the listed names are indeed the commonly cited "Five Eulsa Traitors". The Annexation treaty list has five names, aligning with the "Five O's" label.)

The Three Scoundrels and the Three Evils
In the Sinmyo year [1519] of King Chungjong's reign, Sim Chŏng, Yi Hang, and Kim Kŭkpok held power and harmed loyal and good officials, hence they are called the Three Scoundrels of Sinmyo (辛卯三姦). Also, in the Chŏngyu year [1537], Kim Allo, Hŏ Hang, and Ch'ae Mut'aek held power and repeatedly instigated major purges (大獄), hence they are called the Three Evils of Chŏngyu (丁酉三凶).<57>

**Summary**

This article, titled "Records for Political Reflection," presents a series of historical anecdotes and lists from Korean history, focusing on themes of loyalty, betrayal, political power, and national humiliation. It recounts stories from the early Chosŏn dynasty (T'aejo, Sejo, Tanjong), the Imjin War, the Byeongja Horan (Manchu Invasion), factional struggles (Noron vs. Soron), the rise of "Sedo" politics, and culminates with the ministers involved in the Protectorate (1905) and Annexation (1910) treaties with Japan. The author uses these historical examples, often involving famous figures and events defined by adherence to or betrayal of principles, to implicitly comment on the political landscape and historical memory. From a colonial history perspective, the most revealing part is the final section discussing the Eulsa and Kyŏngsul treaties. The labeling of the Korean ministers involved as "Seven O's" and "Five O's" (likely euphemisms for "Traitors") in a 1926 publication under Japanese rule is significant. It reflects a strong undercurrent of nationalist resentment and the framing of recent history through the lens of collaboration and resistance, drawing parallels with historical instances of betrayal like Sin Sukchu or the factional purges. Historians might find this framing and the specific (though sometimes slightly inaccurate) recounting of these events useful for understanding how historical narratives were constructed and deployed to interpret the colonial present.
