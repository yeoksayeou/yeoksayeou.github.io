稀世의 政治家이며 또 哲學家인 栗谷先生, 朝鮮 十大偉人 紹介의 其三 (Yulgok Sŏnsaeng, a Rare Politician and Philosopher, Introduction to Chosŏn's Ten Great Men, Part Three)

一. 先生의 略歷 (A Brief Biography of the Master)
The Master's surname was Yi, his given name I, his courtesy name Sukhyŏn, and his style name Yulgok. His clan origin was Tŏksu. His father was Wonsu, and his mother was the famous female genius, Saimdang Sin Ssi. He was born in the 30th year of King Chungjong of the Yi Dynasty, Western calendar year 1536, 386 years ago from now, the year of Pyŏngsin, on the 26th day of the 12th lunar month, at the Hour of the Tiger, in Pukp'yŏng Village, Kangnŭng County, Kangwŏn Province (at the maternal grandmother's home, the house of a certain Mr. Yi).
Due to the Master's exceptional genius, he passed the preliminary licentiate examination (chinsa palhaesi) at the age of 13 and achieved great proficiency in composition by ages 14-15. However, clouds of misfortune darkened the Master's path. When the Master was 16, he bid eternal farewell to his most beloved and respected mother, a lady of exceptional intelligence and virtue, a true gentlewoman among women, a female artist possessing all the hundred beauties of calligraphy, painting, and composition. Overcome by boundless resentment and infinite sorrow, the Master wandered into the Kŭmgang Mountains at age 19. After studying Buddhist principles for a year, he emerged from the mountains. From then on, he dedicated himself to Confucianism, forging lifelong friendships with Masters Ugye and Kubong, with whom he discussed morality and scholarship. At 22, he formally welcomed his wife, Lady No. At 23, he visited Master T'oegye, the foremost scholar of the time and the Master's senior.
After specializing solely in Confucian studies for three or four years, he bid eternal farewell to his strict father, Wonsu Kong, who had been left alone after his wife's death, when the Master was 26. At 29, he passed both the licentiate (chinsa) and the higher civil service examination (munkwa), the sole path to advancement in Chosŏn's examination system, consecutively. This marked the beginning of the Master's period of political activity.<63>
As the Master's reputation had originally resounded throughout the nation, he immediately received an appointment as Assistant Section Chief in the Ministry of Taxation (Hojo Chwarang). At 30, he served as Assistant Section Chief in the Ministry of Rites (Yejo Chwarang) and Censor in the Office of the Censor-General (Saganwŏn Chŏng'ŏn). At 33, he became Inspector in the Office of the Inspector-General (Sahŏnbu Chip'yŏng), presenting the "Tongho Mundap" (East Lake Questions and Answers) and memorials on current affairs, vehemently criticizing the administration's policies. From then until age 39, over a period of about six years, he held various important posts both inside and outside the capital, including Compiler in the Office of Special Advisors (Hongmungwan Kyo ri), Section Chief in the Ministry of Personnel (Ijo Chŏngrang), Secretary in the State Council (Ŭijŏngbu Sain), Second Deputy Compiler in the Office of Special Advisors (Hongmungwan Puŭnggyo), Magistrate of Ch'ŏngju (Ch'ŏngju Moksa), Fourth Counselor in the Office of the Censor-General (Saganwŏn Chŏnhan), Third Deputy Compiler (Ŭnggyo), Second Deputy Director (Chikchehak), Second Royal Secretary (Tongbusŭngji), First Royal Secretary (Ubusŭngji), Third Minister of War (Pyŏngjo Ch'amji), Censor-General (Taesagan), and Governor of Hwanghae Province (Hwanghae Kamsa). However, his upright, firm, and pure nature often clashed with contemporary opinion, leading him to spend much time withdrawn in places like P'aju and Haeju.
At the age of 40, the Master received an appointment as Deputy Director (Pujehak). Upon returning to the capital from his countryside home in Haeju, the Easterners and Westerners factional strife, the source of disastrous political conflict for 300 years, first arose, marked by fierce confrontation and struggle. The Master dedicated himself to mediating this conflict, earning the trust and respect of both the court and the public. King Sŏnjo also greatly revered and loved him. From then on, he successively held high positions such as First Royal Secretary (Ubusŭngji), Censor-General (Taesagan), Vice Minister of Personnel (Ijo Ch'amŭi), Governor of Chŏlla Province (Chŏlla Kamsa), Minister of Taxation (Hojo P'ansŏ), Chief Scholar (Taejehak), Minister of War (Pyŏngjo P'ansŏ), and Minister of Personnel (Ijo P'ansŏ). However, he was ultimately forced to resign due to denunciations by petty individuals like Hŏ Pong, Song Ŭnggae, and Pak Kŭnwŏn. The following year, on the 16th day of the first month, when the Master was 49, he suddenly passed away without having fully realized his grand ambitions for purposeful action.

二. 先生의 天才와 品性 (The Master's Genius and Character)
As you readers know, the Master was truly a rare genius. "The spirit between mountains and rivers, a figure above those of the Three Dynasties" was Sŏng Ugye's praise. "In mountains, I see the Diamond Mountains; among men, I see Master Yulgok" was Sin Mant'oe's adoration. "Who says Yulgok's ambition was great but his talent lacking? Can we call it lacking when his talent wasn't used? (Omission) Like clouds passing through the vast sky, leaving no trace, truly a talent born once in ages" was Pak Saam's definitive assessment.
The Master's genius was truly close to innate knowledge. Thus, as soon as he could speak, he learned characters, and consequently, he often composed astonishingly fine phrases impromptu. When the Master was 3 years old, his maternal grandmother, Lady Yi, held him and gave him a pomegranate, asking him to compose a poem. The Master immediately responded, "Inside the pomegranate skin, shattered red jewels (石榴皮裏碎紅珠)." This alone shows the extent of his genius. At age 4, while learning the first volume of the *Saryak* (Brief History) from a village teacher, he corrected the teacher's errors in punctuation and reading. At age 7, he playfully composed a biography of a neighbor, Chin Pokch'ang, writing, "Outwardly appears magnanimous, inwardly harbors resentment; this is a petty man. If this man gains power, he will surely throw the world into chaos." Later, things indeed turned out that way. Ah, how could a 7-year-old child's observation be so sharp, and his writing so fluent? Truly, one cannot say he was not a genius.<64>
From then on, the Master's composition skills progressed daily. At age 8, he wrote the Hwasŏkchŏng poem containing the lines, "The mountain spits out the solitary wheel of the moon, the river embraces the wind of ten thousand li (山吐孤輪月江含萬里風)." At age 10, he composed the famous Kyŏngp'odae Ode with the lines, "Frosty winds shake the earth, sounding like the swords and spears of ten thousand horses; snowflakes tumble through the air, scattering like jade dust for a thousand li (霜風振地, 鳴萬馬之刀鎗, 雪花飜空, 散千里之玉屑)," which became widely recited for generations. At 13, he passed the preliminary licentiate examination, and by 15, his composition had reached full maturity. Ah, while the Master's profound and subtle philosophical thought will be introduced in a later chapter, one cannot help but be astonished that even his literary genius matured so early.
I have often heard and seen that geniuses tend towards wild abandon and easily fall into arrogance and complacency. However, the Master, a genius of bright and penetrating intelligence, also possessed a character like warm jade and pure gold. "His writing was like a heavenly horse soaring through the void; his heart was like the blue sky and white sun." "His natural endowment was extremely high; he was loyal, magnanimous, kind, and gentle. His bearing was outstandingly handsome, his spirit moved people. He was lenient but principled, harmonious but moderate. Joy and anger were not shown on his face, curses and abuse did not pass his lips" is Kim Sangyŏng's record. "His demeanor was simple and clean, his speech candid. When interacting with village people, regardless of age or intelligence, he made each feel happy" is from Kiŭm's miscellany. "He accepted others' words, having an exceptional quality beyond others. If not for having no barrier between self and others, and a peaceful disposition, how could he be like this?" was Song Kubong's praise. "His innate disposition was very high, his cultivation increasingly profound. He was clear, bright, harmonious, pure, candid, composed, brilliant, and resolute. In dealing with people and matters, he acted entirely out of sincerity. Favor or resentment, love or hate, did not occupy his mind in the slightest. People, whether foolish or wise, all placed their trust in him" was Yi T'aektang's admiration.
The Master's natural character was originally plain, easygoing, harmonious, joyful, loyal, magnanimous, kind, and gentle. As he advanced in scholarly cultivation and moral refinement, he became even more mature and seasoned, becoming a teacher and exemplar for his generation and a model for a hundred generations. He fulfilled his duties upwards with filial piety and brotherly love, downwards with kindness and affection, towards the state with loyalty and integrity, and towards friends with sincerity and trust. Therefore, his elder brother respected him, his stepmother was reformed by him, the king trusted him, and friends relied on him. His family was harmonious, the entire nation believed in him, he became a pillar of the state and the pivot of society.
Ah, whenever I read the Master's extant writings, I cannot help but marvel at his genius and revere his character.

三. 先生의 眞理的 硏究의 動機 (The Motivation for the Master's Study of Truth)
Anyone who achieves great deeds or scholarship likely does so driven by a motivating impulse of the highest emotional intensity. In other words, a life lacking such a high-tide emotional impulse motivating it would simply become a desert. Without extraordinary impulse, one cannot achieve extraordinary deeds; without extraordinary motivation, one cannot become an extraordinary great person.
For the great philosopher Master Yulgok, a rose of the world and a diamond of the peninsula, the motivation for his great life dedicated to truth must also have involved an extraordinary emotional impulse. Indeed, it was so. In the path of the Master's flower-like <65> youthful life, unexpected clouds of misfortune gathered, and bleak rain fell. Look, dear readers!
He experienced the eternal parting from his mother, the very source of love, the bundle of joy, equipped with intelligence and talent, who had bestowed upon him both loving grace and nurturing care. This happened when the Master was merely 16 years old, a time when he had not yet completely left his mother's embrace.
Ah, heaven's principle is incomplete, and human affairs are full of regrets. Why does the bright moon, uninvolved with floating clouds, insist on appearing just when it's full? Whenever I read the Master's biography, upon reaching this point, I cannot help but close the book, sigh painfully, and shed tears of sympathy. How much greater must have been the psychological pain of the Master, who experienced this tragic situation firsthand with his heaven-rooted filial piety? The Master's psyche must have been enveloped in endless resentment and boundless sorrow. Moreover, adding frost upon snow, piling adversity upon adversity, his stepmother, possessed of unparalleled wickedness, entered the household, and supreme humiliation increasingly fell upon the Master day by day.
Ah, how could the Master's misfortune reach such a point? Oh, vast blue heavens, what kind of person is this! I shed tears of sympathy for the Master and cannot cease my sympathetic lamentations for the Master.
Even with a virtuous character of humility and a spirit of perseverance like the Master's, his sorrowful fate, assailed both internally and externally, was truly difficult to endure. Therefore, an unusual state arose daily in the Master's psyche. Realizing the impermanence of human life and the multitude of worldly hardships, the only solace for the Master's mind was Buddhist philosophy. This was the most noteworthy emotional impulse in the Master's life, the introductory motivation for his study of truth.

四. 先生의 佛敎的 生涯 (The Master's Buddhist Life)
The prelude to the Master's life dedicated to truth began to unfold from this point. Thus, the Master found supreme interest in it. Time passed relentlessly, like shadows fleeting in a valley, and three years flew by. After taking off the mourning clothes for his mother, he decisively cut off the ten thousand layers of worldly dust and mustered supreme courage. In the spring month of March, at the age of 19, donning already prepared spring clothes, he abruptly escaped into the Kŭmgang Mountains. He sat facing a wall in quiet contemplation, continuing meditative practice for one full year. It seems he attained some awakening to the wondrous true essence of the Great General Aspect Non-Duality Dharma Gate (大總相不二法門), where the three realms are illusory and all phenomena are mind-only. Taking it a step further, it seems the foundation of the Master's philosophical ideals was already firmly established during this period. The Master himself did not testify to this. However, it seems he undoubtedly couldn't reveal his true intentions due to concerns about the attacks from his environment at the time. But synthesizing fragments of his remaining words allows us to sufficiently prove its beginnings.
He asked, <66> "Mencius spoke of inherent goodness and always referred to Yao and Shun; how is this different from 'the mind itself is Buddha (卽心卽佛)'?" He also wrote, "Fish leap, kites fly, above and below are the same; this form is neither color nor emptiness (魚躍鳶飛上下同, 這般非色亦非空)," and "Once there is speech, it is already a realm (旣有言說便是境界)." How could these be the words of common scholars buried in the dust of myriad kalpas? How could they not be the insights of one with the wisdom eye transcending the three realms? Even if I lack the knowledge to "grasp three corners upon seeing one," I can discern the pattern of the whole leopard from seeing a single spot, and know the taste of the whole cauldron from tasting one piece of meat. Although these are mere fragments and single phrases, they are not only supreme evidence of the Master's awakening to the true essence of Buddhism but also an unparalleled bridge and link connecting the spiritual commonalities of Confucianism and Buddhism. At the same time, one cannot help but admire this as a great perspective unprecedented in antiquity.
However, the fact that the Master returned to secular life in the autumn of the following year, one full year after entering the mountains, raises questions for everyone. Leaving the Buddhist life that offered such great comfort and interest and returning again to the secular world of suffering clouds and bitter rain is a kind of difficult riddle. The Master explained the motivation for his return to secular life, stating he was moved by the phrase "Do not entertain thoughts of increase or decrease (勿作增減想)" and thus returned. Consequently, later interpretations uniformly assert that the Master regretted its emptiness and decisively left the monastic life. However, this seems to misunderstand the Master's true intention. Indeed, the essence of Buddhist practice lies solely in these five characters: "Do not entertain thoughts of increase or decrease." If one fulfills "Do not entertain thoughts of increase or decrease," then walking meditation is possible, and market meditation is possible. If one fails to fulfill the essence of "Do not entertain thoughts of increase or decrease," even sitting facing a wall for ten long years will end in failure. Therefore, the Dharma gate of Buddhist awakening lies not in a wall-facing life but, regardless of the means or location, solely in "Do not entertain thoughts of increase or decrease." Simultaneously, realizing that the shortcut for our worldly actions to save the world existed in the contemporary reality of Confucianism, the Master, under the determination to combine Buddhist awakening with Confucian conduct, seems to have left the lonely and tedious world of Kŭmgang and headed towards the Hanyang City of myriad red dust. Taking it a step further, Buddhist practice would be easy wherever one was, as long as one "did not entertain thoughts of increase or decrease." However, in the contemporary society that exclusively revered Confucianism and greatly rejected Buddhism, the Master realized the difficulty of guiding contemporary minds and realizing worldly ideals without going through the gateway of Confucianism, and thus finally returned to secular life.

五. 先生의 儒敎的 生涯 (The Master's Confucian Life)
Therefore, from this point, the Master decided to dedicate himself to a Confucian life. At the same time, he formed an inseparable bond of friendship with his lifelong companions, Masters Ugye (Sŏng Hon) and Kubong (Song Ikp'il). Day and night, they discussed morality, and in his dedicated research into Confucianism, he often transcended time and space, forgetting sleep and food. As time passed and the Master reached the age of 23, he <67> paid respects to Master T'oegye Yi, the foremost scholar of the time whom the Master admired most. At that time, T'oegye was not only a senior elder, over 35 years older than the Master, but also indeed a venerable scholar of profound virtue in terms of learning. Therefore, the Master's admiration and reverence were natural, but T'oegye, upon meeting the young Master just once, not only showed supreme affectionate friendship as if they were old acquaintances ("kingae yŏgu") but also spared no praise, saying, "A high talent in wondrous years, starting on the right path (高才妙年發軔正路)," and "Your arrival clears my mind and awakens my spirit; now I know that beneath a famous name, there is no empty scholar (公來披豁醒心神, 始知名下無虛士)." Whenever he met disciples or friends, he never failed to praise the Master. One can imagine how much he respected the character and cherished the talent and virtue of this young junior scholar. From this point, the Master also greatly revered Master T'oegye. Through some ten exchanges of letters and face-to-face meetings, they debated issues such as "maintaining focus without distraction (主一無適)," "dwelling in reverence and investigating principle (居敬窮理)," "Annotations on the Great Learning and the Doctrine of the Mean (庸學輯註)," and "Ten Diagrams on Sage Learning (聖學十圖)." Thus, he received considerable instruction and influence from Master T'oegye.
The Master's life from then on focused entirely on the Confucian path. Thus, forgetting sleep and food, transcending time and space, he devoted himself to research in his philosophical field for five or six years. Although the Master's philosophical view might have undergone some refinement in his mature years, the fundamental foundation of his thought seems to have been mostly laid during this period. Ah, even for a brilliant talent in his wondrous years, it is truly astonishing that such a great, original, and pioneering ideal was constructed within the mind of a young man not yet 30.

六. 先生의 政治的 生涯와 政治的 理想 (The Master's Political Life and Political Ideals)
The prelude to the Master's political life unfolded from the time he passed the civil service examination (munkwa), the first step on the path of advancement, at the age of 29. As the Master's outstanding reputation for character, insight, writing, and ability resounded through the court and the country, he successively held prestigious positions such as those in the Two Offices (Offices of Censor-General and Inspector-General) and the Office of Special Advisors (Oktang). However, the Master's inherently upright, firm, and pure nature led him to denounce the arrogance of powerful ministers (Yun Wŏnhyŏng) and lament the complacency of poets (sin). He repeatedly submitted memorials with straightforward advice, such as the "Pyŏngin Samch'aek So" (Memorial of Three Policies in 1566), the "Kisa Tongho Mundap" (East Lake Questions and Answers in 1569), the "Kyŏngo Yukch'aek So" (Memorial of Six Policies in 1570), and the "Kapsul Manŏn So" (Ten Thousand Word Memorial in 1574), forcefully pointing out the evils of the times and advocating for reform. Consequently, the monarch (King Sŏnjo) and high ministers (Yi Chun'gyŏng), accustomed to old ways and content with following convention, disliked him. Suspecting his proposals were reckless schemes of a young, inexperienced man fond of causing trouble and seeking change, they refused to trust him. Thus, advancing in the morning and retreating in the evening, stumbling and wandering for ten years, time slipped by, and his great ambitions were thwarted.
From the 8th year of Sŏnjo, Ŭlhae (1575, the Master's 40th year), to the 13th year, Kyŏngjin (1580), for about six years, the factional strife between the Easterners and Westerners became extremely severe. He <68> busied himself trying to mediate it, sometimes seeking the removal of figures like Kim Hyowŏn and Sim Ŭigyŏm from court, other times attempting to harmonize the disputes between Chŏng Ch'ŏl and Yi P'al, dedicating his efforts to debate and clarification, but ultimately achieved no success.
However, King Sŏnjo gradually recognized the Master's talent. From the 14th year (1581, the Master's 46th year), Sinsa, the King placed great trust in him, successively appointing him to high positions such as Minister of Taxation (Hojo P'ansŏ), Chief Scholar (Taejehak), Minister of War (Pyŏngjo P'ansŏ), and Minister of Personnel (Ijo P'ansŏ), entrusting him significantly with state affairs. The Master, deeply moved by this recognition, devoted himself entirely to national affairs for three years. However, ultimately due to the denunciations by figures like Pak Kŭnwŏn, Song Ŭnggae, and Hŏ Pong, he could not fulfill his original aspirations and resigned. Soon after, afflicted by illness (lit. attacked by the Two Ministers of Illness), he passed away suddenly, leaving behind endless regrets.
Although the Master's political career, as described above, was one of misfortune and setbacks without great success, his political ideals can be glimpsed from his extant writings and memorials.
Specifically, in the "Pyŏngin Samch'aek So," the three great policies of "rectifying the mind to establish the foundation of governance, employing the worthy to purify the court, and stabilizing the people to solidify the basis of the state" form its outline. In the "Kisa Chin'gang ŭi Tongho Mundap" (East Lake Questions and Answers presented during a lecture in 1569), "cultivating oneself through practical effort, discerning villains and employing the worthy, reforming abuses and stabilizing the people, promoting learning and educating people, and rectifying names as the foundation" is its main theme. In the "Kyŏngo Simu So" (Memorial on Current Affairs in 1570), "reducing imperial expenditures to relieve the people's burden, reforming elaborate rituals to correct troublesome complexity, consolidating government offices to eliminate redundant personnel, curtailing excessive spending to aid state finances, emphasizing provincial appointments to entrust local magistrates, and clearing wrongful accusations to satisfy public sentiment" is his assertion. In the "Kapsul Manŏn So" (Ten Thousand Word Memorial in 1574), "establishing will, striving in learning, eliminating selfishness, associating with the worthy to cultivate oneself, opening the mind with sincerity, reforming tribute methods, honoring frugality, changing appointment methods, and reforming military administration to stabilize the people" is its outline. In the "Im'o Sip'ye So" (Memorial on the Evils of the Time in 1582), he vehemently discussed the four great evils: "the world is stained by following convention, cumulative failures result from clinging to vested interests, government is disordered by frivolous discussions, and the people are impoverished by accumulated abuses." In the "Kyemi Yukcho Ŭi" (Six Point Proposal in 1583), he presented six major policies: "appointing the worthy and capable, nurturing the military and civilians, securing sufficient finances, strengthening border defenses, preparing warhorses, and clarifying moral transformation," urging King Sŏnjo to implement them. For the future of the country, he advocated raising a large army of 100,000 men, but ultimately, due to opposition from court ministers lacking foresight and preoccupied with immediate concerns, it was not implemented.
However, while the Master's sound arguments were unique and unparalleled policies in the context of the monarchical despotism of the time, and certainly a level above the views of the shortsighted mediocrities around him, critiqued from the perspective of modern political commentators, there are few points that can be revered as remarkably prescient. The Master's strength, the point deserving our prostration, lies rather in his scholarly genius than his political maneuvering, or rather in his philosophical thought than his political theory. Thus, the author, like the reader, wishes to revere the Master not as a political great man but as a philosophical great man. At the same time, disregarding presumption, I wish to turn my pen henceforth towards the aspect of the Master's thought.

七. 先生의 哲學的 思想 (The Master's Philosophical Thought) <69>

가. 先生以前의 朝鮮 儒家思想의 發達 (Development of Korean Confucian Thought Before the Master)
To introduce the Master's philosophical thought, one must first address the sequence of development of Korean Confucian thought. Just as in China, although the origins of Confucianism certainly came from the pre-Qin period, the true systematization of Confucian philosophy first occurred at the hands of the Song Confucians like Zhou, Zhang, Cheng, and Zhu, similarly in our Chosŏn, although the formal importation of Confucianism occurred thousands of years ago, and the importation of Song Confucian doctrines began with the great figures U Tak, Paek Ijŏng, An Hyang (Yi Tongbaek seems incorrect here, perhaps referring to An Hyang?) in the late Koryŏ period, followed by the successive emergence of great scholars like Chŏng Mongju (P'oŭn), Kil Chae (Yaŭn), Kim Chongjik (Chŏmp'il), and Cho Kwangjo (Chŏngam) over the next hundred years or so, this was all an era of importation and interpretation. The true digestion and refinement of these ideas to form a unique, original cosmology and view of life began with Master Hwadam. Taking a step forward, the first thinker who could be called a pioneering, self-aware, unique thinker, who removed the flaws and contradictions of the Song Confucians and constructed a thorough Confucian philosophical cosmology, was Master Hwadam, followed sequentially by Masters T'oegye, Yulgok, and Nosa.
Master Hwadam, as the first original Confucian philosopher in the East, had thought, as introduced in the previous issue, that was thoroughly materialistic (唯物論) and was the world's first proponent of the indestructibility of matter (物質不滅論).
However, Master T'oegye, who succeeded him, doubted Master Hwadam's theories for leaning too heavily towards materialism. Simultaneously, he adopted the dualism of principle and material force (理氣兩元論) of Cheng Yi (Ich'ŏn) and Zhu Xi (Hoeam), improving or supplementing their flaws and deficiencies to construct his own cosmology, while fiercely opposing Master Hwadam's materialism.
Master T'oegye's thought, also introduced in the previous issue, can be summarized by his statement, "In a person's body, principle (理) and material force (氣) combine to produce life, thus the two mutually issue forth and function (盖人之一身理與氣合而生故二者互有發用)." He asserted the innate existence of both principle (li) and material force (ki) – essentially mind and matter – while emphasizing that the force of their subsequent activation and change is their mutually issuing function, thus firmly planting the banner of mind-matter dualism (心物兩元論). His conclusion was, "The moral mind (道心) issues from principle, the human mind (人心) issues from material force (道心發於理, 人心發於氣)," following Zhu Xi's dichotomous theory that "[emotions] either originate from the correctness of nature and destiny or arise from the selfishness of physical form and material force (或原於性命之正, 或生於形氣之私)." He also stated, "The Four Beginnings (四端) are principle issuing forth and material force following; the Seven Emotions (七情) are material force issuing forth and principle riding upon it (四端理發而氣隨之, 七情氣發而理乘之)," arguing for the mutually issuing function of the Four Beginnings and Seven Emotions in our psyche, thereby establishing a thoroughly dualistic cosmology. Our intellectual impulse's demand is often unsatisfied by non-ultimate dualism, as seen in Indian or Western philosophical history. Similarly, among the later scholars of that time, Master Ki Kobong (Taesŭng) doubted its non-ultimacy, leading to over ten exchanges debating the Four-Seven Thesis (四七論). However, he merely seized upon minor details and peripheral arguments for debate. Then, when the clear-minded and meticulous Master Yulgok appeared, he doubted the incompleteness of the theory of mutual issuance of principle and material force (理氣互發論). After more than ten years <70> of careful thought and deliberation, he finally rejected its contradictions and constructed his own unique philosophical view.

나. 先生의 本軆論 (The Master's Ontology/Theory of Substance)
The Master rejected Hwadam's monism of material force (唯氣論) and criticized T'oegye's dualism of principle and material force (理氣兩元論). However, the Master too, from the perspective of reality, acknowledged the rational existence of both principle (理) and material force (氣). Simultaneously, to prove their wondrous coalescence where they are neither one nor two, he stated:
"Principle is the master of material force; material force is that which principle rides upon. Without principle, material force has no foundation; without material force, principle has nowhere to rely. They are neither two substances nor one substance. Because they are not one substance, they are one yet two; because they are not two substances, they are two yet one. Why are they not one substance? Although principle and material force cannot be separated, within their wondrous combination, principle is principle and material force is material force, not intermingled; therefore, they are not one substance. Why are they not two substances? Although it is said principle is principle and material force is material force, they are fused without interval, without precedence or succession, without separation or union, not seen as two substances; therefore, they are not two substances. Therefore, activity and stillness have no beginning, yin and yang have no origin. Because principle has no origin, material force also has no origin."
(夫理者氣之主宰也 氣者理之所乘也 非理則氣無所根柢 非氣則理無所依着 旣非二物 又 非一物 非一物故 一而二 非二物故 二而一也 非一物者何謂也 理氣雖相離不得而 妙合之中 理自理  氣自氣不相挾雜故 非一物也 非二物者何謂也 雖曰理自理 氣自氣而 渾淪無間 無先後無離合 不見其爲二物故 非二物也 是故動靜無端 陰陽無始 理無始故氣亦無始也)
Thus, from the perspective of their inherent nature, principle has its independent nature, and material force has its independent nature. He proved that even amidst their "wondrous combination where they cannot be separated," they maintain their unique individual realities. Simultaneously, he refuted Hwadam's thought, which "completely denied the reality of principle and regarded it merely as an attendant law of the activity, stillness, and change of material force."
From the perspective of their operation, the movement of the two has no precedence or succession, no separation or union. Even though principle has its independent nature and material force has its independent nature, their fusion is "fused without interval (渾淪無間)." They are essentially one substance with two aspects, absolutely lacking independent action. Simultaneously, he pointed out the error of T'oegye's "theory of the mutual issuance of principle and material force (理氣互發論)."
In summary, from the perspective of inherent nature, it is dualistic; from the perspective of operation, it is monistic. This is precisely the theory of one substance with two aspects (兩性一軆論), similar to Spinoza's theory of one substance with two attributes. Those who strive in philosophical inquiry, regardless of time period, have invariably suffered distress over the disparate phenomena of mind and matter. Thus, advocating such a theory of one substance with two aspects during transitional periods to resolve this difficult problem is often seen in the history of philosophy in both India and Europe.

다. 理通氣局論(理氣의 性質論) (Theory of Principle's Pervasiveness and Material Force's Limitation / Theory of the Nature of Li and Ki)
Having already acknowledged the existence of principle and material force as independent and distinct natures, the question immediately arises as to the difference in their qualities. Therefore, to explain this difference, the Master proclaimed the four characters "Principle is pervasive, Material force is limited (理通氣局)," <71> which he boasted as his own unique invention. He first presented the proposition, "Principle is formless while material force has form, therefore principle is pervasive and material force is limited (理無形而氣有形故理通而氣局)," and then explained it in detail:
"What is meant by 'Principle is pervasive'? Principle has no beginning or end, no precedence or succession. Because it has no beginning/end or precedence/succession, before responding it is not prior, after responding it is not posterior. Therefore, riding on material force, it flows diversely and unevenly, yet its essential wondrous nature is present everywhere. When material force is partial, principle is also partial, but what is partial is not principle, but material force. When material force is complete, principle is also complete, but what is complete is not principle, but material force. Even amidst the clear and turbid, pure and mixed, dregs and ashes, dung and filth, principle is present everywhere. It is named as [a thing's] nature (性), but its essential wondrous nature is not harmed in its self-sameness. This is called the pervasiveness of principle.
What is meant by 'Material force is limited'? Material force, having already involved form and trace, has beginning and end, precedence and succession. The basis of material force is simply tranquil oneness, clarity, and vacuity. How could there ever be the material force of dregs, ashes, dung, and filth? Only because it ascends, descends, flies, and scatters, never ceasing, does it become diverse and uneven, giving rise to myriad transformations. Thus, in the flow of material force, there are cases where it does not lose its original nature, and cases where it loses its original nature. Once it loses its original nature, the original nature of material force is no longer present. Partialness is partial material force, not complete material force. Clarity is clear material force, not turbid material force. Dregs and ashes are the material force of dregs and ashes, not the material force of tranquil oneness, clarity, and vacuity. It is not like principle, whose essential wondrous nature is present everywhere in the myriad things. This is called the limitation of material force."
(理通者何謂也 理者無本末也 無先後也 無本末無先後故 未應不是先 已應不是後 是故乘氣流行 參差不齊而 其本然之妙 無乎不在 氣之偏則理亦偏而 所偏非理也氣也 氣之全則理亦全而 所全非理也氣也 至於淸濁粹駁糟粕煨燼糞壤汙穢之中 理無所不在 名爲其性而 其本然之妙則 不害其自若也 此之謂理之通也
氣局者何謂也 氣已涉形跡故 有本末也 有先後也 氣之本則 湛一淸虛而已 曷嘗有糟粕煨燼糞壤汙穢之氣哉 惟其升降飛揚 未嘗止息故 參差不齊而萬變生焉 於是氣之流行也 有不失其本然者 有失其本然者 旣失其本然則 氣之本然者 已無所在 偏者偏氣也 非全氣也 淸者淸氣也 非濁氣也 糟粕煨燼糟粕煨燼之氣也 非湛一淸虛之氣也 非若理之於萬物 本然之妙 無乎不在 此所謂氣之局也)
He demonstrated that even amidst the complex and changing myriad differentiations, there is not the slightest change in the inherent nature of principle; only its position and expression differ according to the changing limitations of material force. This is like how the expression of water differs according to square or round vessels, and the expression of space differs according to large or small bottles, yet the inherent nature of water and space remains utterly unchanged. He proved that all events and transformations in the universe are solely the limited changes of material force, while the inherent nature of principle, regardless of its changing position, is uniquely unchanging, thoroughly systematic and pervasive. He clarified that principle possesses universal reality – unchanging, neither increasing nor decreasing, neither arising nor ceasing – while material force is a locally flowing entity that arises and ceases according to time, changes according to place, and is diverse and uneven, thereby pointing out the difference between principle and material force. This bears resemblance to the Buddhist theory of True Suchness (眞如) and Ignorance (无明), showing how much the Master's thought was influenced by Buddhist ideas.

라. 緣起論 (Theory of Origination/Dependent Arising)
Having asserted that the ultimate reality consists of both principle and material force, and that their differentiating characteristics are unchanging and universal (Principle is pervasive) versus changing and limited (Material force is limited), the logical next step in the Master's argument concerns his theory of origination (緣起論). That is, where does the driving force for the activation and change from innate reality towards the subsequent phenomenal world reside? This becomes the immediate question. If principle and material force are both innate, ultimate realities, does the driving force for the developing and changing subsequent world lie in principle? In material force? Or equally distributed between principle and material force? Or in the harmony of principle and material force? This is the greatest question.<72>
Therefore, the Master's answer was:
"Principle is non-active (無爲), while material force is active (有爲); therefore, material force issues forth, and principle rides upon it."
(理無爲而氣有爲故 氣發而理乘)
He asserted that principle, being metaphysical, is a kind of non-active, non-potent entity, while material force, being physical, possesses a kind of active potency. Thus, principle's "essential wondrous nature (本然之妙)" merely rides upon and is present within the self-moving, self-acting development and change of material force. To clarify this further, he stated:
"What is meant by 'material force issues forth, and principle rides upon it'? The mechanism of yin and yang, activity and stillness, is spontaneous; there is nothing that causes it. When yang is active, principle rides upon the activity; it is not principle that is active. When yin is still, principle rides upon the stillness; it is not principle that is still."
(氣發而理乘者何謂也 陰陽動靜 機自爾也 非有使之者也 陽之動則 理乘於動非理動也 陰之靜則理乘於靜非理靜也)
And:
"The transformations of the Way of Heaven, the issuing forth of my mind – none are other than material force issuing forth and principle riding upon it. What is called 'material force issuing forth and principle rides upon it' does not mean material force precedes principle. Since material force is active and principle is non-active, the statement cannot be otherwise."
(天道之化 吾心之發, 無非氣發而理乘之也 所謂氣發而理乘者 非氣先於理也 氣有爲而理無爲則 其言不得爾也)
Thus, he repeatedly explained that the universe's originating driving force resides solely in material force. He proved that the stillness of yin-ki and the activity of yang-ki occur spontaneously through their own mechanisms, not by the command or agency of principle. Simultaneously, the stillness of yin and activity of yang are precisely the self-stillness and self-activity of the two material forces (yin and yang), and the inherent principle merely rides upon and is present within them.
However, if the verdict were only as stated above, principle would be a kind of non-active, impotent appendage, a mere idol riding along and attached to the solo stage of material force's self-acting, self-moving performance. This would simultaneously contradict the verdict from his ontology, where he affirmed the dualistic reality of principle and material force from the perspective of their inherent natures, stating:
"Principle is the master of material force; material force is that which principle rides upon."
(理者氣之主宰也 氣者理之所乘也)
Therefore, to eliminate this contradiction, he stated:
"That which issues forth is material force; that *by which* it issues forth is principle. Without material force, it cannot issue forth; without principle, there is nothing to issue forth."
(發之者氣也 所以發者理也 非氣則不能發 非理則無所發)
And:
"Yin being active and yang being still – its mechanism is spontaneous, but that *by which* yin is still and yang is active is principle."
(陰動陽靜 其機自爾而 其所以陰靜陽動者理也)
Thus, he again assigned the function of the two characters "whereby" or "that by which" (所以) to the non-active, merely-riding principle. However, where does the intended meaning of these two characters "soyee" (所以) lie? This is indeed a question within a question, but the intended meaning of these two characters seems not to be one of command or agency, but rather a meaning related to lawfulness observed from the side. That is, although the driving force for the development and change of the universe lies solely in material force, the *law* according to which it develops and changes is principle – this seems to be the meaning.
However, this is a kind of explanation made out of necessity to salvage the self-contradiction regarding the theory of one substance with two aspects advocated in his ontology. We can only conclude that the Master's theory of origination is a monism centered on material force (唯氣的 一元論). In any case, the Master's theory of reality as one substance with two aspects was influenced by T'oegye's dualism and advanced one step beyond it. His monistic theory of origination centered on material force seems to have been greatly influenced by Hwadam's vitalistic monism (唯氣論) and the Buddhist Alaya-vijñana theory of origination (阿賴耶識緣起論). <73>
At the same time, the Master fiercely opposed T'oegye's dualistic theory of origination based on the mutual issuance of principle and material force – that is, T'oegye's idea that the driving force of the universe's development and change lies in the mutual issuance of both principle and material force.
"Principle and material force cannot be separated. Since they cannot be separated, their issuing forth and functioning is one. It cannot be said that they mutually issue forth and function. If one says they mutually issue forth and function, then when principle issues forth and functions, material force might sometimes not reach it, and when material force issues forth and functions, principle might sometimes not reach it. If so, then principle and material force would have separation and union, precedence and succession; activity and stillness would have ends, yin and yang would have beginnings. The error would not be small." (理氣二者 不能相離 旣不能相離則 其發用一也 不可謂互有發用也 若曰互有發用則 是理發用時氣或有所不及 氣發用時 理或有所不及也 如是則理氣有離合有先後 動靜有端 陰陽有始矣 其錯不少矣)
And:
"If Zhu Xi truly thought that principle and material force mutually issue forth and function, opposing each other and each emerging separately, then Zhu Xi was also mistaken." (若朱子眞以爲 理氣互有發用 相對各出則 是朱子亦誤也)
Thus, he attacked T'oegye's theory of mutual issuance of principle and material force without leaving any room for maneuver. This, of course, can be called the natural conclusive judgment for the Master, who had advanced one step from T'oegye's pure dualism to advocate the theory of one substance with two aspects and the monistic theory of origination centered on material force.

마. 四七論 (The Four-Seven Debate)
If the foundation differs, naturally the branches, leaves, and results will also differ accordingly. The thought of Masters T'oegye and Yulgok, whose assertions differed in ontology and theory of origination, also resulted in different observations in the Four-Seven Debate (四七論), each following their own specific basis. T'oegye, who advocated the theory of mutual issuance of principle and material force as a result of dualistic ontology, stated:
"The Four Beginnings (四端) are principle issuing forth and material force following; the Seven Emotions (七情) are material force issuing forth and principle riding upon it."
(四端理發而氣隨之 七情氣發而理乘之)
In response, the Master, who advocated the monistic theory of origination centered on material force as a result of the theory of one substance with two aspects, stated:
"The functioning of my mind is precisely the transformation of heaven and earth. Since the transformation of heaven and earth has no two origins, the issuing forth of my mind has no two sources."
(吾心之用 卽天地之化也 天地之化 無二本故 吾心之發 無二原矣)
And:
"The transformation of heaven and earth is precisely the issuing forth of my mind. If the transformation of heaven and earth involved distinct transformations of principle and transformations of material force, then my mind too should have distinct issuances of principle and issuances of material force. Since heaven and earth have no distinction between transformation by principle and transformation by material force, how could my mind possibly have the principle of issuing forth from principle and issuing forth from material force? If one says my mind differs from the transformation of heaven and earth, that is beyond my foolish comprehension."
(天地之化卽吾心之發也 天地之化若有理化氣化者則 吾心亦當有理發氣發者矣 天地旣無理化氣化之殊則 吾心安得有理發氣發之理乎 若曰吾心異於天地之化則 非愚之所知也)
Thus, he passionately voiced strong opposition and, to clarify, further stated:
"The Four Beginnings are the good side of the Seven Emotions. The Seven Emotions are the aggregate of the Four Beginnings. How can one side be set in opposition to the aggregate as two distinct sides?"
(四端是七情之善 一邊也 七情是四端之摠會者也 一邊安可與摠會者 分兩邊相對乎)
And:
"Outside the seven, there are no other emotions. The Four Beginnings are just another name for good emotions. When speaking of the Seven Emotions, the Four Beginnings are included within them."
(七者之外 無他情 四端只是善情之別名 言七情則四端在其中矣)
Thus, he explained that the Four Beginnings and Seven Emotions are essentially the same feelings, not two distinct entities of different natures. Taking it a step further, he stated:
"What is called 'material force issues forth and principle rides upon it' is correct. Not only are the Seven Emotions like this, but the Four Beginnings also involve material force issuing forth and principle riding upon it." <74>
(所謂氣發而理乘之者可也 非特七情爲然 四端亦是氣發而理乘之也)
Thus, he refuted T'oegye's mutually issuing Four-Seven theory and, to prove his point, stated:
"Only after seeing a child about to fall into a well does the feeling of commiseration arise. Seeing and feeling commiseration is material force; this is what is called 'material force issuing forth.' The root of commiseration is benevolence (仁); this is what is called 'principle riding upon it.'"
(見孺子入井然後乃發惻隱之心 見之而惻隱者氣也 此所謂氣發也 惻隱之本則仁也 此所謂理乘之也)
This is precisely the Four-Seven theory observed from the perspective of the monistic theory of origination centered on material force. Simultaneously, regarding the issue of the human mind (人心) and the moral mind (道心), he thoroughly refuted Ugye's arguments, which were based on Zhu Xi's theory that emotions "[either] originate from the correctness of nature and destiny [or] arise from the selfishness of physical form and material force (或原於性命之正 或生於形氣之私)" and T'oegye's idea that "the moral mind issues from principle, the human mind issues from material force (道心發於理 人心發於氣)," and which continuously posed perplexing questions based on these. Thus, he asserted that the source of not only the functioning of the Four Beginnings and Seven Emotions but also the origin of the human mind and the moral mind lies singularly in material force.

바. 先生의 思想의 長所와 缺點 (Strengths and Weaknesses of the Master's Thought)
Summarizing the Master's systematic thought, just as T'oegye advocated the dualism of principle and material force as a reaction against Hwadam's monism of material force, the Master also advocated the theory of one substance with two aspects as a reaction against T'oegye's incomplete dualism. As often seen in the development of philosophical thought in India and the West, the succession of the theory of one substance with two aspects following dualism is a common pattern and sequence in the development of our thought. Therefore, one can assert that the Master's thought was a step more advanced than that of Cheng-Zhu and T'oegye. Furthermore, as a result of the theory of one substance with two aspects, he advocated a monistic theory of origination, asserting thoroughgoing monism regarding both the transformations of heaven and earth and the origin of our minds, seeking to demolish T'oegye's dualistic standpoint without leaving any room. This can be called a stage of progress in Confucian philosophy and the great shining point of the Master's thought.
However, on the flip side, contradictions and weaknesses are also not few. For a shallow-sighted junior scholar like myself to attempt criticism of the Master's thought is, of course, presumptuous. But having taken up the pen, I cannot refrain from writing down my thoughts. Thus, I wish to point out two or three points that seem most flawed in the Master's thought. (1) In ontology, affirming the independent reality of material force from the perspective of its inherent nature, while in the theory of qualities, attributing arising/ceasing, change, or differentiation to material force, is a major contradiction. If material force itself is a real substance, it should have no arising/ceasing, no change, no differentiation. If it has arising/ceasing, change, and differentiation, then it cannot be a real substance.
(2) In ontology, advocating a theory of reality as one substance with two aspects for both principle and material force, while in the theory of origination, asserting that principle is merely non-active and riding along, with activity, stillness, and change entirely due to material force's self-action and self-cessation, and simultaneously stating "there is nothing that causes it (非有使之)," is the second contradiction. If the originating driving force lies solely in material force, with principle being merely a non-active, riding-along idol, then principle would certainly be a dead thing, not a reality. If principle is indeed a reality, then in terms of origination, it should not be a non-active, riding-along idol. The Master, to defend his self-contradiction, stated "that *by which* it issues forth is principle (所以發者理也)" and "that *by which* yin is still and yang is active is principle (所以陰靜陽動者理也)," assigning the function of the two characters "soyee" (所以) to principle. However, having already expressed, in statements like "its mechanism is spontaneous; there is nothing that causes it (其機自爾非有使之)," "that which issues forth is material force (發之者氣也)," <75> and "yin's stillness and yang's activity, its mechanism is spontaneous (陰靜陽動其機自爾)," that the development and change of the universe are the arbitrary self-action and self-movement of material force, with principle being non-active and uninvolved, the two characters "soyee" become entirely meaningless empty terms. Therefore, Master Ki Nosa (Chŏngjin), who advocated a theory centered on principle (唯理論), strongly refuted this point.
(3) The Master, in order to refute Hwadam's theory of the indestructibility of matter – stating "one material force eternally exists; the past does not depart, the future does not continue (一氣長存, 往者不過來者不續)" and "there is gathering and scattering, but no existence and non-existence (有聚散而無有無)" – argued, "Principle does not change, but material force does change. The primal material force generates unceasingly; the past departs, the future continues, and the already past material force is no longer present (理無變而氣有變 元氣生生不息 往者過來者續而 已往之氣巳無所在)." But this is the Master's most mistaken idea. If "the past departs, the future continues, and the already past material force is no longer present," then since "the past has already perished," the greatest question becomes "from where does the future arise?" (往者已滅 커늘 來者何處生고). In other words, if past material force has already perished and disappeared, the greatest question is, from where does the endless future material force come into being? If living material force dies and perishes, there can be no circulation. Without circulation, the universe would perish and die. This, of course, might be a result derived from his own theory of qualities (material force is limited), which affirmed the arising/ceasing and change of material force. However, it also contradicts and clashes with his own ideas like "activity and stillness have no end, yin and yang have no beginning (動靜無端陰陽無始)" and "the primal material force generates unceasingly (元氣生生不息)." Moreover, from the perspective of the 20th century, which affirms the theory of the indestructibility of matter, one cannot help but side with Hwadam's thought. Simultaneously, one cannot help but lament deeply that the Master's thought cannot avoid being a blemish on correct insight.
However, this thought was formulated during the Master's youth, at age 37, and moreover, during a period when he was bustling with political life. Therefore, such flaws were unavoidable. But if the Master's genius had been combined with Hwadam's dedicated effort and T'oegye's longevity, one speculates that his philosophical achievements would have been truly great. At the same time, one cannot help but feel regretful lamentation for the Master's situational misfortune (in retrospect) and his short lifespan.

八. 結論 (Conclusion)
The Master was a rare great genius, a magnanimous gentleman, a sincere patriot, an adept politician, a brilliant and insightful great writer, and a sharp, original philosopher. Who could be compared to the Master? In China, perhaps Wang Yangming; in Europe, perhaps Goethe – apart from them, it seems difficult to find a personality equipped in such diverse and multifaceted ways.
Ah, how great! A philosopher! When the philosopher withers, even Mount Tai crumbles; when the philosopher passes away, the state also becomes exhausted – so said the ancients. The philosopher is the pioneer of cultural development and the guide of social life. If philosophers do not arise, history becomes a desert, and society loses its direction.
Ah, whose gift, whose achievement shall we call the radiant brilliance over 500 years and the splendid blossoming of culture throughout the 3,000-league Land of Hibiscus? It is undoubtedly the lingering grace of the culture pioneered and guided by great philosophers like the Master. How could I not praise him, how could I not revere him? Right now, I wish to prostrate my whole body to venerate him, and wielding both pen and tongue, to praise him. At the same time, I pray and hope that in our 20th-century youth circles, a second Yulgok, a great philosopher, will rise again to pioneer our thorny path forward, dispel the dark clouds, bring the dawn of light back to our spiritual world, and make the brilliant flowers of culture bloom again in our history. With this, I put down my worn-out brush. (End) <76>

**Summary**

This 1921 article presents Yi I (Yulgok) as one of Chosŏn's ten great men, highlighting his genius, character, political career, and philosophical thought. It details his early life, the profound impact of his mother Shin Saimdang's death, his brief period studying Buddhism, and his subsequent dedication to Confucianism and statecraft. The article discusses his political struggles, factional mediation efforts, and policy proposals, ultimately deeming his philosophical contributions more significant than his political achievements. It analyzes Yulgok's unique Neo-Confucian philosophy, particularly his theory of "one substance with two aspects" (兩性一軆論) and "principle is pervasive, material force is limited" (理通氣局), contrasting it with the ideas of Hwadam (Sŏ Kyŏngdŏk) and T'oegye (Yi Hwang). While praising Yulgok's advancements, the author also critiques perceived contradictions in his system, particularly regarding the nature of material force (氣) and its relation to principle (理). The article concludes by extolling Yulgok as a multifaceted genius comparable to Wang Yangming or Goethe and expresses hope for a "second Yulgok" to guide Korea in the modern era.

From a colonial history perspective, the article is significant for its timing (1921, during Japanese rule) and its focus on establishing a national narrative around a pre-colonial Chosŏn figure. By presenting Yulgok as a "rare genius," philosopher, and patriot, the author implicitly elevates Korean intellectual history and cultural identity during a period of foreign domination. The call for a "second Yulgok" to lead the nation through its "thorny path" carries clear nationalist undertones, suggesting a desire for intellectual and perhaps political revival led by figures embodying traditional Korean virtues and genius.

그로부터 儒學에 專精하기 三四年間이러니 26歲時에 子子孤親인 先生의 嚴父 元秀公을 마저 永訣하얏고 29歲時에 朝鮮過去의 唯一의 發身的 經路인 進士의 文科를 連中케 되면서 이로부터 先生의 政治的 活動時期가 되엇섯다.＜63＞
先生의 令譽가 本來- 全國에 震動하얏슴으로 即 地에 戶曹佐郞의 拜命을 바닷고 30歲에 禮曹佐郞, 司諫院 正言을 經歷하고 33歲에 司憲府 持平이 되어 東湖問答과 時務䟽策을 進呈하야 時政을 痛論하얏고 이로부터 39歲까지 前後 6年間에 弘文舘 校理, 吏曹正郞, 議政府 舍人, 弘文舘 副應敎, 淸州牧使, 司諫院 典翰, 應敎, 直提學, 同副丞旨, 右副丞旨, 兵曹參知, 大司諫, 黃海監司 等의 內外要職을 經過하얏스나 亢直介潔한 先生의 天性은 時論과 相容치 못함으로 마츰내 坡州 海州 等地에 退臥한 時日이 만핫섯다.
先生의 40歲時에 副提學의 拜命을 밧고 海州鄕園으로부터 다시 入城하자 300年來에 慘天極地의 大政爭의 弊源인 東西人의 黨爭이 初起하야 角立抗爭함이 激烈함으로 先生이 그를 調和하기에 盡力하매 朝野가 다 先生을 倚重하고 宣祖도 또한 크게 敬愛하사 이로부터 右副丞旨, 大司諫, 吏曹參議, 全羅監司, 戶曹判書, 大提學, 兵曹判書, 吏曹判書 等의 重職을 歷任하얏스나 마츰내 許篈, 宋應漑, 朴謹元 等 小人輩의 疏斥으로 因하야 辭退하더니 翌年 곳 先生의 49歲되던 해 正月 16日에 有爲의 大志를 未敷하고 奄然이 長逝하엿다.

二. 先生의 天才와 品性
讀者 여러분도 아시는 바와 가티 先生은 참으로 稀世의 大天才일다. 「山河間氣, 三代上人物」이라 함은 成牛溪의 讚歎이오, 「於山見楓嶽, 於人見栗谷先生」이라 함은 申晩退의 崇仰이며, 「孰謂栗谷志大才踈, 不用其才而謂之疎可乎, (中略) 如雲之過太空, 罔有痕跡, 眞所謂間出之資也」라 함은 朴思菴의 定評일다.
先生의 天才는 正말 生知에 가차웟다. 그럼으로 겨우 言語를 吐하자 文字를 알게 되엇스며 딸아서 驚人의 佳句도 흔이 口占하얏섯다. 先生의 3歲時에 外王母 李夫人이 先生을 업고 石榴를 따주면서 賦詩를 命하매 先生은 곳 應口輒對로 「石榴皮裏碎紅珠」라 하엿다. 그만하야도 그의 天才가 어떠함을 알만 하겟도다. 4歲時에 鄕先生에게 史略初卷을 受學하다가 鄕先生의 句讀의 錯誤됨을 較正하얏고 7歲에 隣人陳復昌傳을 戱製호대 「外若坦坦, 內懷慼慼, 此小人也. 使此人得志, 必淆亂世道矣」리라 하더니 其後에 果然 그와 가탓섯다. 아- 7歲의 幼兒로서 觀察이 어찌 그리 銳利하얏스며, 文章이 어찌 그리 流暢하얏슬가? 참으로 그가 天才가 아니라 할 수 업도다.＜64＞
그로부터 先生의 文章은 날로 進就되어 8歲에 「山吐孤輪月江含萬里風」이라 하는 花石亭詩를 지엇고 10歲에 「霜風振地, 鳴萬馬之刀鎗, 雪花飜空, 散千里之玉屑」이라 하는 有名한 鏡浦臺賦를 지어 百世에 膾炙人口하얏고 13歲에 進士初試를 마첫스며 15歲에 文章이 大成하얏섯다. 아- 先生의 深奧精微한 哲學的 思想은 後章에 紹介하려니와 先生의 文學的 天才로만도 이러틋 夙成하얏슴에 놀라지 아니할 수 업도다.
나는 往往히 듯고 보앗노라. 天才는 흔이 放狂에 흐르고 驕泰에 빠지기 쉬우나 先生은 聰明英達의 天才로서 溫玉精金의 品性을 兼하얏섯다. 「其文如天馬驤空, 其心如靑天白日」이엇섯다. 「天禀極高, 忠厚愷悌, 容儀秀發, 神彩動人, 寬而有制, 和而有節, 喜慍不形於色恚罵不發於口」라 함은 金沙溪의 記錄이오 「風儀簡潔 言語坦蕩, 興鄕人接, 無少長愚智, 各得歡心」이라 함은 畸菴의 雜錄이며, 「容受人言, 別有過人處, 非物我無阻, 氣象平和, 能若是耶」아 함은 宋龜峯의 稱道요 「資禀甚高, 充養益厚, 淸明和粹, 坦夷英果, 待人處物一出於誠信, 恩嫌愛惡一毫不以介意, 人無愚智無不歸心」이라 함은 李澤堂의 歎美일다.
先生의 天品이 原來- 平易和樂하고 忠厚愷悌한 君子人으로서 學問的 修養과 道義的 琢磨의 進就함을 딸아 더욱 圓熟하고 더욱 老成하야 一代의 師宗이 되엇고 百世의 乘範이 되엇섯다. 우로는 孝悌, 알에로는 慈愛, 國家엔 忠貞, 朋友에 誠信을 다하얏섯다. 그럼으로 老兄이 敬服하고 庶母가 感化하면 君王이 信任하고 朋友가 依歸하야 家庭이 和樂하고 擧國이 信仰하며 國家의 棟樑이 되고 社會의 中樞가 되엇섯다.
아- 先生의 遺傳을 읽을 제마다 先生의 天才를 驚歎치 아니할 수 업스며 先生의 品性을 崇仰치 아니할 수 업도다.

三. 先生의 眞理的 硏究의 動機
누구이던지 偉大한 事業이나 學問을 成就하는 者는 가장 高潮인 感激的 衝動의 動機가  업시 된 者가 업슬 것이다. 곳 換言하면 高潮의 感激的 衝動의 動機가 업는 그의 一生은 곳 沙漠이 되고 말 것이다. 非常의 衝動이 아니면 非常의 事業을 이루지 못할 것이오 非常의 動機가 아니면 非常의 偉人이 되지 못할 것이다.
世界의 薔薇花요 半島의 金剛石인 大哲人 栗谷先生의 偉大한 眞理的 生活의 動機도 또한 非常한 感激的 衝動이 업지 못할 것이다. 果然일다. 그러하다. 꼿 가튼 先生의＜65＞ 少年的 生涯의 前途에는 無妄의 劫雲이 얼키고 慘淡한 悲雨가 나리도다. 보시오. 讀者 諸君이시어!
가장 사랑의 源泉이오 깃븜의 뭉치며 聰明才德이 具備하고 恩愛撫育이 兼至하던 先生의 母夫人을 永訣케 되엇도다. 때는 마츰 先生의 芳年이 겨우 16歲로서 母夫人의 懷中에서 完全이 벗어나지 못하얏슬 때일다.
아- 天理가 未圓하고 人事가 多恨하도다. 月明何預浮雲事하야 便向圓處故故生고! 내- 先生의 傳記를 읽을 제마다 이에 이르러서는 掩卷痛歎에 同情의 熱淚를 뿌리지 아니할 수 업도다. 하물며 根天의 誠孝로 그의 悲境을 親當한 先生의 心理的 苦痛이야 그 어떠하얏슬가? 先生의 心理에는 無盡의 寃恨과 無涯의 悲哀로 싸고 말엇슬 것이다. 더구나 雪上에 加霜으로 逆境에 逆境을 더하야 絶倫의 悖惡을 具備한 그의 庶母가 入門하면서 無上의 困辱이 先生의 身上에 날로 더하게 되엇도다.
아- 先生의 不運이 어찌 이에 이르럿는가? 悠悠蒼天아 此何人斯오! 내- 先生을 爲하야 同情의 熱淚를 뿌리고 先生을 爲하야 同情의 痛歎을 마지 안노라.
先生과 가티 謙讓의 德性과 堅忍의 志氣를 가지고도 內外兩面으로 突擊이 되는 그의 悲哀的 運命에는 참으로 忍耐키 어려웟섯다. 그럼으로 先生의 心理狀態에는 날로 異狀이 생기어 人生의 無常함과 世苦의 多端함을 覺悟하는 同時에 先生의 心理에 唯一의 慰安을 줌은 오즉 佛敎哲學 뿐이엇섯다. 이가 先生의 一生에 가장 特筆大書할만한 感激的 衝動이오 眞理的 硏究의 入門的 動機엿섯다.

四. 先生의 佛敎的 生涯
先生의 眞理的 生涯의 序幕은 이로부터 開展되기 始作하얏다. 그래서 先生은 그에 無上의 趣味를 부티자 居諸가 無常하고 壑蛇가 影忙하야 3個의 星霜을 倏過하고 報恩의 衰麻를 벗게 됨으로 萬重의 塵魔를 快斷하고 無上의 大勇을 奮發하야 19歲되던 해 春3月에 旣成의 春服을 떨쳐입고 飄然이 金剛山에 逃入하야 面壁靜坐하야 沈思冥想的 修道를 繼續하기 1週年이엇섯다. 그래서 三界가 虛僞요 萬法이 唯心인 大總相不二法門의 妙藏眞諦를 覺悟한 바가 잇슨 듯하다. 한 거름을 더 나아가 말하면 先生의 哲學的 理想은 이 時代에 벌서 鞏固한 基礎를 세운 듯하다. 先生은 親이 그를 證言하신 바가 업섯다. 마는 그는 勿論- 當時에 環境의 攻擊을 念慮하야 眞意를 吐露치 못함인 듯하다. 그러나 片片의 遺言을 綜合하야 보면 그의 端緖를 넉넉히 證明할 수 잇다.
「孟子道性善言必稱堯舜何異於卽心卽佛」고 하며＜66＞ 「魚躍鳶飛上下同, 這般非色亦非空」이라 하고 「旣有言說便是境界」라 하얏도다. 이 어찌 萬丈劫塵에 埋沒된 俗儒輩의 言說이며 이 어찌 超出三界的 慧眼者의 所見이 아니랴? 내 아무리 「擧一隅而反三的」知識이 업더래도 一斑을 보아 全豹의 빗을 알만하며 一臠을 들어 全鼎의 맛을 알만하도다. 이 아무리 片片의 隻句일지라도 先生의 佛敎的 眞諦를 覺悟한 無上의 證據品일 뿐아니라 儒佛 兩敎의 精神上 共通點을 聯絡함에 無上한 橋梁이오 連鎖인 同時에 前古 未曾有의 大眼目임을 讚歎치 아니할 수 업도다.
그러나 先生이 入山한 지 1週年 곳 翌年 秋期에 還俗하얏다 함에 對하야서는 누구나 疑問 中의 疑問으로서 그와 가티 가장 慰安과 趣味를 줄만한 佛敎的 生活을 버리고 다시 劫雲苦雨의 俗界로 돌아왓슴은 一種 難解의 謎問일다. 先生은 그의 還俗케 된 動機를 說明함에 「勿作增減想」하라 한 一節에 被動되어 還俗함을 言明하얏다. 그래서 後人의 解釋으로는 先生이 그 虛無함을 悔悟하고 退俗함을 斷言함에 一致하얏다. 그러나 그는 先生의 眞意를 誤解함인 듯하다. 果然 佛敎的 工程의 要諦는 「勿作增減想」 5字에 잇슬 뿐일다. 「勿作增減想」만 하면 行禪도 可하며 市禪도 可할 것이오 萬一 「勿作增減想」의 要諦를 履行치 못하면 아무리 10年의 長歲月間을 面壁坐定할지라도 不成功에 돌아가고 말 것이다. 그럼으로 佛敎的 覺悟의 法門은 面壁的 生活에 잇슴이 아니오 方便의 如何와 位置의 如何를 勿論하고 「勿作增減想」에 잇슬 뿐임을 覺悟한 同時에 吾人의 濟世的 行風의 捷徑이 儒敎的 現實社會에 存在함을 確然이 自覺케 된 先生은 佛敎的 覺悟에 儒敎的 行風을 兼帶하랴는 決心下에서 寂寞無聊의 金剛界를 버리고 紅塵萬丈의 漢陽城을 向하게 된 것인 듯하다. 한 거름을 더 나아가 말하면 佛敎的 工程은 어떠한 位置에 잇던지 「勿作增減想」만 하면 容易할 것이어니와 儒敎를 專尙하고 佛敎를 大斥하던 當代 社會에 잇서서 儒敎의 門戶를 노코는 現在的 人心을 指導하고 濟世的 理想을 實現키 困難함을 悟得한 先生은 마츰내 還俗케 된 것이다.

五. 先生의 儒敎的 生涯
그래서 先生은 이로부터 儒敎的 生涯에 獻身함을 確定하얏다. 同時에 終生의 道友인 牛溪(成渾) 龜峰(宋翼弼) 兩先生과 莫逆의 交誼를 締結하야 日夜로 道義를 講磨하고 儒學에 專精硏究하기에 往往이 時空을 超越하고 寢食을 忘却하얏섯다. 그러구러 先生의 年齡이 23歲가 되자 當代의 碩學으로서 先生의 第一 慕仰하던 退溪 李先生을＜67＞ 拜謁케 되엇섯다. 當時에 退溪는 先生보다 年齡으로도 35歲 以上의 先進長者일 뿐 아니라 學問으로도 果然- 宿德老學이엇섯다. 그럼으로 先生의 慕仰과 崇拜함은 勿論이어니와 退溪끠서도 妙齡의 先生을 한번 보매 傾盖如舊의 無上한 敬愛의 交情을 다할 뿐 아니다. 「高才妙年發軔正路」라 하며, 「公來披豁醒心神, 始知名下無虛士」라 하야 極口의 讚辭를 靳惜지 안하얏고 門人交友를 對할 제마다 先生을 讚揚치 아니한 적이 업섯다. 아무리 後進少年일지라도 얼마나 그의 人格을 敬重하며 才德을 寵愛하얏슴을 알만 하겟도다. 先生도 이로부터 退溪先生을 크게 崇仰하는 同時에 前後 十數回의 書簡과 面質로 「主一無適」 「居敬窮理」,「庸學輯註」, 「聖學十圖」 等의 問題를 들어 往復辯難하얏섯다. 그래서 退溪先生의 薰陶와, 感化를 바듬이 적지 안하얏섯다.
先生의 生涯는 이로부터 儒敎的 方面에 專注하얏다. 그래서 寢食을 忘却하며 時空을 超越하고 그의 哲學的 方面에 專精硏究하기 五六年間이엇섯다. 아마 先生의 哲學觀은 老成時期에 多少의 潤色이 업지 안하얏겟지마는 그의 根本的 思想의 土臺는 이 時期에 거의 築上이 된 듯하도다. 아- 아무리 妙年英才일지라도 그의 偉大한 獨創的 開拓的 理想을 30未滿의 靑年의 頭腦 中에서 建設됨은 참으로 驚歎치 아니할 수 업도다.

六. 先生의 政治的 生涯와 政治的 理想
先生의 政治的 生涯의 序幕은 29歲時에 發身的 經路의 初程인 文科를 마침으로부터 展開되엇섯다. 先生의 人格, 識見, 文章, 才能의 拔群的 令譽가 朝野에 震動함으로 兩司玉堂 等의 華職을 次序로 經歷하얏스나 先生의 天性이 亢直介潔하야 權臣(尹元衡)의 跋扈함을 論斥하고 詩人의 苟安함을 痛聲하며 「丙寅三策䟽」,「己巳東湖問答」,「庚午六策䟽」,「甲戍萬言䟽」等 直言을 屢上하야 時弊를 痛陳하고 改革을 主唱함으로 當時에 舊習에 慣泥하고 循俗에 安逸한 君主(宣祖)와 大臣(李浚慶)이 그를 厭忌하야 年少迂濶한 靑年輩의 好事喜變的 妄想으로 疑訝하는 同時에 信任을 不肯함으로 朝進暮退에 蹭蹬栖屑하기 10年間에 歲月이 荏苒하고 大志가 蹉跎하얏슬 뿐이오.
宣祖8年 乙亥(先生의 40歲時)로부터 同13年 庚辰까지 前後 6年間에는 東西人의 黨爭이 殆甚함으로 그를＜68＞ 調停하기에 奔走하야 或은 金孝元, 沈議謙輩를 黜外하고 或은 鄭澈, 李潑輩의 論爭을 調和하야 論難辯釋하기에 專力하얏스나 마츰내 成效가 업섯다.
그러나 宣祖-漸漸 先生의 才能을 認識하야 14年 (先生의 46歲時) 辛巳부터 先生을 크게 信任하사 戶 曹判書, 大提學, 兵曹判書, 吏曹判書 等의 重職을 連授하야 國政을 크게 秀托함으로 先生도 또한 知遇에 感激하야 國事에 盡瘁하기 3年間이엇스나 마츰내 朴謹元, 宋應漑, 許篈輩의 疏斥으로 因하야 素志를 이루지 못하고 辭退하자 二竪의 侵畧을 바다 無盡의 遺恨을 끼치고 奄然이 別世하얏섯다.
先生의 政治的 生涯로는 前記와 가티 不遇落拓的 生涯로서 偉大한 成功이 업섯스나 先生의 政治的 理想은 遺著와 䟽剳로 부터 그의 槪略을 窺見할 수 잇다.
곳 丙寅三策疏에는 「正心以立治本, 用賢以淸朝廷安民以固邦本」의 三大策이 그의 網領이오 己巳進講의 朿湖問答에는 「務實修己, 辨奸用賢, 革弊安民, 獎學敎人, 正名爲本」이 그의 主旨며 庚午時務䟽에는 「减御用以舒民力,工祀典以改煩黷, 省官司以汰冗員, 歛浮費以助國用, 重外任以委守牧, 雪寃枉以快衆心」이 그의 主張이오 甲戍萬言䟽에는 「立志勉學去私親賢以修己, 開誠心改貢案, 崇節儉變選上, 改軍政以安民」이 그의 網領이며 壬午時弊䟽에는 「世汚於循俗, 積敗於食志, 政亂於浮議, 民窮於積弊」의 四大時弊를 들어 痛論하얏고 癸未六條議에는 「任賢能, 養軍民, 足財用, 固藩屛, 備戰馬, 明敎化」의 六大策을 들어 그의 實行함을 宣祖끠 迫請하면서 國家의 將來를 爲하야 10萬의 大兵을 養成함을 主張하얏스나 마츰내 苟苟無遠慮한 朝臣輩의 反對로 因하야 實行이 되지 못하얏섯다.
그러나 先生의 正論은 君主專制政治인 當時에 잇서서는 唯一無二한 政策이며 苟苟한 周圍의 俗輩의 所見보다는 一層-超出치 안함이 아니지마는 現代的 政論家의 眼目으로 批評하자면 그다지 놀랄만한 先見으로 推仰할만한 點이 적엇섯다. 先生의 長處 곳 우리의 膜拜할만한 點은 차라리 先生의 政治的 手段보다도 學者的 天才,또는 政治的 理論보다도 哲學的 思想, 곳 그에 잇다 할만하도다. 그래서 筆者는 先生을 讀者와 가티 政治的 偉人으로 보지안코 哲學的 偉人으로 崇拜코자 하는 同時에 儧越함을 下計하고 이로부터서는 先生의 思想的 方面으로 筆鋒을 돌리고자 하노라.

七. 先生의 哲學的 思想＜69＞

가. 先生以前의 朝鮮 儒家思想의 發達
先生의 哲學的 思想을 紹介하랴면 먼저 朝鮮儒家 思想의 發達된 順序를 들지 아니 할 수 업다. 中國에서도 儒敎의 起源이 先秦時代부터 옴은 勿論이지마는 儒敎哲學의 正말 組織되기는 周張程朱等 宋儒의 손에서 처음 됨과 가티 우리 朝鮮에서도 形式的 儒敎의 輸人된지는 벌서 몃 千年前이며 宋儒의 學說을 輸人하기도 麗末의 偉人禹易東白彝齋兩先生의 손으로 비롯하야 그로부터 白餘年間에 鄭圃隱, 吉冶隱, 金佔畢, 趙靜庵 등의 碩學이 繼出하얏지마는 그는 다 輸入的 解釋的 時代로서, 참으로 그를 咀嚼하고 硏鑽하야 自家獨特的 宇宙觀 人生觀을 組成하기는 花潭先生으로부터 비롯하얏다. 一步를 前進하야 말하면 開拓的 自覺的 獨特의 思想家로서 宋儒의 缺陷과 矛盾을 除去하고 徹底한 儒敎哲學的 宇宙觀을 組成하얏다 할만한 이는 花潭先生이 처음으로서 退溪
栗谷
蘆沙三先生이 順序的으로 繼出하얏도다.
花潭先生은 東方最初의 獨唱的 儒敎哲學家로서 그의 思想은 前號에 紹介함과 가티 徹底한 唯物論이오 物質不滅論의 世界的 首唱者일다.
그러나 그의 뒤를 繼承하야 나신 退溪先生은 花潭先生의 學說이 넘우나 唯物論에 偏傾하얏슴을 疑訝하는 同時에 程伊川朱晦菴의 理氣兩元論을 襲取하야 그네의 缺陷과 未備點을 改良 또는 補充하야 自家的 宇宙觀을 組立하면서 花潭先生의 唯物論을 猛烈이 反對하얏섯다.
退溪先生의 思想도 勿論-前號에 紹介한바이지마는 그의 要點을 再擧하면 「盖人之一身理與氣合而生故二者互有發用」이라 하야 理氣兩者 곳 心物兩者의 先天的 實在임을 斷言하는 同時에 後天的 發作變化의 勢力이 그의 互發的 作用임을 力說하야 心物兩元論의 旗幟를 兀然이 세웟고. 그의 結論으로 「道心發於理, 人心發於氣」라 하야 朱子의 「或原於性命之正, 或生於形氣之私」라 한 二歧論에 隨應하고 「四端理發而氣隨之, 七情氣發而理乘之」라 하야 吾人의 心理上 四七兩者의 互發的 作用을 主張하야 徹頭徹尾히 兩元論的 宇宙觀을 세웟섯다. 吾人의 知識的 衝動의 要求는 究竟的이 아닌 兩元論에 滿足한 慰安을 엇지 못함은 往往 印度 또는 西洋哲學史上에서도 봄과 가티 當時 後進 中에서도 奇高峰(大升)先生이 그의 非究竟的임에 置疑하야 前後十數度의 四七論에 對한 往復辯論이 잇섯스나 그는 다만 苟苟한 末節餘論을 捕捉하야 辯論할 뿐 이러니 明哲精詳한 栗谷先生이 나시매 그의 不徹底한 理氣互發論에 置疑하야 精思熟慮하기＜70＞ 十餘年에 마츰내 그의 矛盾點을 除斥하고 自家獨特의 哲學觀을 組立하얏섯다.

나. 先生의 本軆論
先生은 花潭의 唯氣論을 排斥하고 退溪의 理氣兩元論을 非難하얏다. 그러나 先生도 實在的 方面으로서는 理氣兩者의 理性的 存在임을 認定하는 同時에 그의 非一非二的 妙契處를 証明키 爲하야
「夫理者氣之主宰也 氣者理之所乘也 非理則氣無所根柢 非氣則理無所依着 旣非二物 又 非一物 非一物故 一而二 非二物故 二而一也 非一物者何謂也 理氣雖相離不得而 妙合之中 理自理  氣自氣不相挾雜故 非一物也 非二物者何謂也 雖曰理自理 氣自氣而 渾淪無間 無先後無離合 不見其爲二物故 非二物也 是故動靜無端 陰陽無始 理無始故氣亦無始也」
라 하얏섯다. 곳 理氣兩者의 自性的 方面으로 보면 理는 理의 獨立的 自性이 잇고 氣는 氣의 獨立的 自性이 잇서서 아무리 「妙合不相離」하는 中에서도 自家의 獨特的 個性의 實在를 維持함을 証明하는 同時에 花潭의 「理의 實在를 全然이 否定하고 氣의 動靜變化의 附屬的 法則으로 看做」한 思想을 反駁하얏고
理氣兩者의 運行的 方面으로 보면 兩者의 運行이 先後가 업고 離合이 업서서 아무리 理는 理의 獨立的 自性, 氣는 氣의 獨立的 自性이 잇더래도 그의 融合함이「渾淪無間」하야 곳 一軆兩性으로서 獨立的 行動이 絶對的으로 업슴을 証明하는 同時에 退溪의 「理氣互發論」의 誤翏됨을 指斥하얏다.
곳 그를 摠括하야 말하면 自性的 方面으로는 兩元이오 運行的 方面으로는 一元일다. 이가 곳 兩性一軆論으로서 「스피노사」의 一軆兩面論과 類似한 思想일다. 哲學的 考究에 努力하는 者에게는 古今을 勿論하고 心物兩者의 異性的 現狀에 苦痛을 밧지 안는 이가 업섯다. 그래서 往往 過渡時期에 이와 가티 一軆兩性을 主張하야 그의 難問을 解決코자 함은 印度에서도 歐洲에서도 哲學史上에 種種이 보는 바일다.

다. 理通氣局論(理氣의 性質論)
이미 理氣兩者의 獨立的 異性의 存在를 認定한 以上에는 그의 性質上 差異點이 如何한가 함이 곳 잇대인 疑問이 될 것이다. 그럼으로 先生은 그의 差異點을 說明키 爲하야 곳 先生의 自家獨創的 發明이라 誇示하는 「理通氣局」＜71＞ 四字를 부르지젓섯다. 그래서 「理無形而氣有形故理通而氣局」이라는 命題를 先揭하고 다시 그를 詳細히 說明키 爲하야
「理通者何謂也 理者無本末也 無先後也 無本末無先後故 未應不是先 已應不是後 是故乘氣流行 參差不齊而 其本然之妙 無乎不在 氣之偏則理亦偏而 所偏非理也氣也 氣之全則理亦全而 所全非理也氣也 至於淸濁粹駁糟粕煨燼糞壤汙穢之中 理無所不在 名爲其性而 其本然之妙則 不害其自若也 此之謂理之通也
氣局者何謂也 氣已涉形跡故 有本末也 有先後也 氣之本則 湛一淸虛而已 曷嘗有糟粕煨燼糞壤汙穢之氣哉 惟其升降飛揚 未嘗止息故 參差不齊而萬變生焉 於是氣之流行也 有不失其本然者 有失其本然者 旣失其本然則 氣之本然者 已無所在 偏者偏氣也 非全氣也 淸者淸氣也 非濁氣也 糟粕煨燼糟粕煨燼之氣也 非湛一淸虛之氣也 非若理之於萬物 本然之妙 無乎不在 此所謂氣之局也」
라 하야 複雜變化의 萬殊的 方面에서도 理의 本然的 性質上에는 毫末도 變化가 업고 오즉 氣의 變局을 딸아 位置와 表現뿐 殊異함이 「물」의 表現이 아무리 方圓의 器를 딸아 달코 空의 表現이 아무리 大小의 甁을 딸아 다를지라도 물의 自性과 空의 自性은 毫末도 變化됨이 업슴과 가틈을 証明하얏다. 곳 宇宙萬般의 事變이 다 氣의 局限的 變化뿐이오 理의 自性은 如何한 變化的 位置에 잇더래도 唯一不變으로서 徹頭徹尾히 系統的 遍通的임을 証明하얏다. 곳 理는 不增不減不生不滅唯一不變의 普遍的 實在性으로서 氣는 隨時生滅, 隨處變化參差不齊의 局部的 流動軆임을 言明하야 理氣兩者의 差異點을 指摘하얏다. 그는 곳 佛家의 眞如无明論과 類似한 點으로서 先生의 思想이 얼마나 佛敎思想的 影響을 입엇슴을 알만 하도다.

라. 緣起論
究竟的 實在는 理氣兩者로서 그의 差理性은 不變的 普遍的(理通)이며 變化的 局部的(氣局)임을 斷言한 先生의 論理上 順序는 勿論 그의 緣起論 곳 先天的 實在로부터 後天的 現像界에 向하야 發作變化됨의 原動力이 那邊에 存在한가 함이 잇대인 疑問이 될 것이다. 곳 理氣兩者가 先天的 究竟的 實在라 할진대 發展變化的 後天世界의 原動力이 理에 잇슬가? 氣에 잇슬가? 또는 理氣兩者에 同一한 分配로 잇슬가? 理氣兩者의 調和的으로 잇슬가? 함이 가장 큰 疑問일 것이다.＜72＞
「그래서 先生은 그의 解答으로
「理無爲而氣有爲故 氣發而理乘」
이라 하야 形而上의 理는 一種 無爲無能性이며 形而下의 氣는 一種 有爲有能性이 잇슴으로 氣의 自動自行的 發展變化地頭에 理의 「本然之妙」가 隨乘隨在일뿐임을 斷言하면서 그를 다시 釋明키 爲하야
「氣發而理乘者何謂也 陰陽動靜 機自爾也 非有使之者也 陽之動則 理乘於動非理動也 陰之靜則理乘於靜非理靜也」
라 하며
「天道之化 吾心之發, 無非氣發而理乘之也 所謂氣發而理乘者 非氣先於理也 氣有爲而理無爲則 其言不得爾也」
라 하야 宇宙의 緣起的 原動力이 氣에 專在함을 重複히 說明하얏다. 곳 陰氣의 靜함과 陽氣의 動함이 그 機틀의 제절로 됨이오 理의 命令的 所使가 아닌 同時에 陰靜陽動이 곳 陰陽二氣의 自動自靜으로서 그 中에 本然之理가 隨乘隨在하얏슬 뿐임을 証明하얏다.
그러나 萬一-以上의 斷案과 가틀 뿐이라 하면 理는 一種 無爲無能的 肉疣驥蠅으로서 氣의 自動自行的 獨舞臺上에 隨乘隨附한 偶像뿐인 同時에 本軆論上에서
「理者氣之主宰也 氣者理之所乘也」
라 하야 理°£兩者의 自性的 方面으로 二元的 實在임을 肯定한 斷案과 抵觸이 됨으로 그의 矛盾點을 除去키 爲하야
「發之者氣也 所以發者理也 非氣則不能發 非理則無所發」
이라 하며
「陰動陽靜 其機自爾而 其所以陰靜陽動者理也」
라 하야 다시 無爲徒乘的인 理上에 「所以」二字의 職任을 附與하얏다. 그러나 그의 「所以」二字의 命意가 那邊에 存在한가? 그는 곳 疑問 中의 疑問이지마는 그의 「所以」二字의 命意가 使令 또는 命役的 意義가 아니요 側而觀察上의 法則的 意味인듯하다. 곳 宇宙의 發展變化的 原動力은 氣뿐에 잇슬지라도 그의 發展變化케 되는 바의 法則은 理이라 하는 意味인듯하다.
그러나 그는 一種-本軆論上에서 主張한 兩性一軆論에 대한 自家撞着의 矛盾點을 救濟키 爲하야 不得已한 說明으로서 先生의 緣起論은 唯氣的 一元論임을 斷案할 수 밧게 업다. 아무리나 先生의 兩性一體的 實在論은 退溪의 兩元論의 影響을 바다 그에서 一步를 前進한 바요 先生의 唯氣的(一元)緣起論은 花潭의 唯起論과 佛家의 阿賴那識緣起論의 影響을 바든 바가 만흔 듯 하도다.＜73＞
그와 同時에 先生은 退溪의 理氣互發의 兩元的 緣起論 곳 宇宙 發展變化의 原動力이 理氣兩者의 互發에 잇슴을 主張한 退溪思想을 猛烈이 反對하얏다.
理氣二者 不能相離 旣不能相離則 其發用一也 不可謂互有發用也 若曰互有發用則 是理發用時氣或有所不及 氣發用時 理或有所不及也 如是則理氣有離合有先後 動靜有端 陰陽有始矣 其錯不少矣라 하며
「若朱子眞以爲 理氣互有發用 相對各出則 是朱子亦誤也」
라 하야 退溪의 理氣互發論을 餘地업시 攻擊하얏다. 그는 勿論-退溪의 純然한 兩元論에서 一步를 前進하야 兩性一體論과 唯氣的 緣起論을 主張한 先生으로는 當然한 結果的 斷案이라 할만하도다.

마. 四七論
根柢가 다르면 勿論-枝葉도 結果도 딸아서 다른 것이다. 本體論 緣起論에서 主張이 殊異한 退栗兩先生의 思想은 四七論에서도 各其-自家의 特殊的 根據를 딸아 觀察이 다르게 되엇섯다. 兩元的 本體論의 結果로 理氣互發論을 主張하던 退溪는
「四端理發而氣隨之 七情氣發而理乘之」
라 하얏슴에 對하야. 兩性一體論의 結果로 唯氣的 緣起論을 主張하던 先生은
「吾心之用 卽天地之化也 天地之化 無二本故 吾心之發 無二原矣」
라 하며
「天地之化卽吾心之發也 天地之化若有理化氣化者則 吾心亦當有理發氣發者矣 天地旣無理化氣化之殊則 吾心安得有理發氣發之理乎 若曰吾心異於天地之化則 非愚之所知也」
라 하야 猛烈한 反對論을 絶叫하고 그를 釋明키 爲하야 다시
「四端是七情之善 一邊也 七情是四端之摠會者也 一邊安可與摠會者 分兩邊相對乎」
아 하며
「七者之外 無他情 四端只是善情之別名 言七情則四端在其中矣」
라 하야 四端七情이 곳 同一한 感情으로서 異性的 兩件物이 아님을 說明하고 一步를 前進하야
「所謂氣發而理乘之者可也 非特七情爲然 四端亦是氣發而理乘之也」＜74＞
라 하야 退溪의 互發的 四七論을 反駁하고 그를 証明키 爲하야
「見孺子入井然後乃發惻隱之心 見之而惻隱者氣也 此所謂氣發也 惻隱之本則仁也 此所謂理乘之也」
라 하얏섯다. 이가 곳 唯氣的 一元的 緣起論의 眼目으로 觀察한 四七論으로서 그와 同時에 人心道心의 問題에 對하야서도
「或原於性命之正 或生於形氣之私」
라 한 朱子의 學說과
「道心發於理 人心發於氣」
라 한 退溪의 思想을 依據하야 迷惑的 質問을 繼續的으로 提出하는 牛溪의 言論을 餘地업시 論駁하얏섯다. 그래서 四端七情의 發用은 勿論-人心道心의 發源도 氣的一元에 잇슴을 斷言하얏도다.

바. 先生의 思想의 長所와 缺點
先生의 系統的 思想을 槪括하애 말하면 退溪가 花潭의 唯氣論에 對한 反動으로 理氣兩元論을 主張함과 가티 先生도 또한 退溪의 不徹底한 兩元論에 대한 反動으로 兩性一軆論을 主張한 바이라. 印度와 西洋의 哲學的 思想發達上에서도 往往이 봄과 가티 兩元論의 뒤에서 一軆兩性論이 繼起함은 吾人의 思想發達上의 公例이며 順序일다. 그럼으로 先生의 思想은 程朱와 退溪의 思想보다 一層-進步된 思想임을 斷言할 수 잇슬 뿐 아니라. 一軆兩性論의 結果로 主張한 緣起的 一元論의 天地의 變化와 吾心의 發源을 勿論하고 徹頭徹尾히 一元的임을 主張하야 退溪의 二元的 立脚地를 餘地업시 破壞코저 하얏섯다. 그가 곳 儒敎哲學의 一段의 進步며 先生의 思想의 偉大한 光輝點이라 할만하도다.
그러나 그의 反面에는 矛盾과 缺點도 또한 적지안타. 筆者와 가튼 淺見後學으로 先生의 思想을 批評코저 함은 勿論-惶恐한 바이지마는 旣爲-붓을 들은 以上에는 나의 생각되는 바를 쓰지 아니할 수 업다. 그래서 先生의 思想上에 가장 缺陷된 바 2,3點을 들고저 하노라.    (一)本軆論上에서는 氣의 自性的 方面으로 獨立的 實在性을 肯定하고서 性質論上에서는 氣의 生滅變化 또는 差別性을 附與함이 가장 矛盾된 點일다. 萬一-氣 그것이 實在物이라 하면 生滅이 업고 變化가 업고 差別이 업슬 것이오 萬一 生滅이 잇고 變化가 잇고 差別이 잇다 하면 그는 實在가 아닐 것이다.
(二)本軆論上에서는 理氣兩者의 兩性一軆的 實在論을 主張하고서 緣起論上에서는 理는 오즉 無爲徒乘으로서 動靜變化가 全혀 氣의 自行自止뿐인 同時에 「非有使之」라 斷言함이 第二의 矛盾點일다. 萬一-緣起的 原動力이 氣에 잇슬 뿐으로서 理는 無爲徒乘의 偶像뿐이라 하면 理는 勿論-死物이라 實在가 아닐 것이오 理가 萬一-實在라 하면 緣起上에도 無爲徒乘的 偶像이 아닐 것이다. 先生은 그의 自家撞着을 辯護키 爲하야 「所以發者理也」라 하며 「所以陰靜陽動者理也」라 하야 理上에 「所以」二字의 職任을 附與하얏스나 「其機自爾非有使之」며 「發之者氣也」며＜75＞ 「陰靜陽動其機自爾」등 說話時에 벌서 宇宙의 發展變化가 氣의 任意的 自行自動으로서 理의 無爲無關함을 表現한 以上에는 「所以」二字가 아주 無意味한 虛名詞에 지나지 못한 바일다. 그럼으로 唯理論을 主張하든 奇藘沙(正鎭)先生이 그 點에 對하야 크게 反駁한 바일다.
(三)先生은 花潭의 「一氣長存, 往者不過來者不續」이라 하며 「有聚散而無有無」라 한 物質不滅論을 反駁키 爲하야 「理無變而氣有變 元氣生生不息 往者過來者續而 已往之氣巳無所在」라 하얏섯다. 마는 그가 先生의 가장 錯誤된 思想일다. 萬一-「往者過來者續而已往之氣已無所在」라 하면 「往者已滅」커늘 「來者何處生」고 함이 가장 疑問일 것이다. 다시 말하면 往氣가 이미 滅絶하얏다 하면 無盡한 來氣는 어대로부터 生來할가 함이 가장 疑問일다. 萬一-生氣가 死滅한다 하면 循環이 업슬 것이다. 循環이 업는 同時에 宇宙는 死滅이 되고 말 것이다. 그가 勿論-氣의 生滅變化를 肯定한 自家의 性質論(氣局)上으로부터 온 結果이겟지마는 「動靜無端陰陽無始」라 하며 「元氣生生不息」이라 한 自家思想에도 矛盾撞着이되는 바일다. 하물며 物質不滅論을 肯定하는 20世紀的 眼孔으로야 돌이어 花潭의 思想에 右袒치 아니할 수 업는 同時에 先生의 思想이 正見에 一累가 됨을 免치 못함을 浩歎치 아니할 수 업도다.
그러나 그는 다 先生의 37歲의 靑年時代며 더구나 政治的 生涯에 奔汨한 時期에 組立한 思想임으로 그와 가튼 缺點이 업지 못한 것이다마는 萬一-先生의 天才로서 花潭의 篤功과 退溪의 壽耈를 兼햇섯더면 그의 思想上 成就가 참으로 偉大하얏슬 것임을 推測하는 同時에 先生의 位置的 不幸(反面으로)과 壽耈的 短淺에 對한 遺憾的 浩歎이 업지 안토다.

八. 結論
先生은 稀世의 大天才며 敦厚의 君子人이오 至誠의 愛國者며 敏腕의 政治家요 灑落通透의 大文豪며 銳利獨唱의 哲學家일다. 先生과 匹儔할 者-그 누구일가? 中國으로는 王陽明, 歐洲로는 「꿰터」를 노코서는 그와 가티 多種多方面으로 具備한 人格을 구할 곳이 업슬 듯 하도다.
아-偉大하도다. 哲人이어? 哲人이 萎矣면 泰山도 頹矣며 哲人이 云亡이면 邦國도 盡瘁한다 함은 古人의 이른 바일다. 哲人은 文化發展의 開拓者며 社會生活의 指導者로서 哲人이 不起면 歷史는 沙漠이 되며 社會는 方向을 일코 말 것이다.
아-500年月에 光輝가 燦爛하고 三千槿域에 彩花가 爛漫케 됨이 그 뉘의 줌이며 그 뉘의 功이라 할가? 勿論 先生과 가튼 大哲人의 開拓的 指導的 文化의 餘蔭일다. 내 어찌 그를 讚頌치 안하며 그를 崇拜치 안하랴? 나는 卽今 나의 五軆를 投地하야 그를 膜拜하며 筆, 舌을 俱鼓하야 그를 讚美코저 하는 同時에 20世紀 우리 靑年界에서 第二栗谷인 大哲人이 復起하야 우리의 荊棘的 前途를 開拓하고 暗黑的 陰雲을 撥散하야 우리의 心界에 光明의 曙光을 다시 주고 우리의 歷史에 燦爛의 彩花를 다시 피게 하야 줌을 빌고 바라면서 禿筆을 끄치노라.(끗)＜76＞
