**Body Text Translation:**
辛酉嘉俳日省墓于抱川路經築雪嶺時山月皎皎樹影婆裟徘徊良久有感述懷
						崔誠愚
The old road I seek seems connected then broken again,
How pitifully the mountain moon seems to pursue my arising thoughts.
Passing through woods, crossing streams, windingly ascending,
Suddenly I recall my grandfather walking this way back then.<27>

**Summary**

This poem by Ch'oe Sŏngu describes a journey on Chuseok day in 1921 to visit ancestral graves in Poch'ŏn, passing over Ch'uksŏllyŏng Pass. The poet observes the bright moon and dancing tree shadows, which evoke feelings of nostalgia and melancholy as he lingers on the path. The experience triggers a memory of his grandfather who traversed the same route in the past. From a historical perspective, the poem subtly reflects the persistence of traditional Korean customs like Chuseok *sŏngmyo* (grave visiting) and Confucian filial piety during the Japanese colonial period. Historians might find interest in this expression of personal sentiment and connection to lineage and place, offering a quiet counterpoint to the broader political and social upheavals of the era.
