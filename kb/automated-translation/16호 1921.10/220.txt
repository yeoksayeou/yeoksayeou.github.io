Author: 石溪
Article Type: 시 (Poem)

For ten years, I have been a visitor to Yongsan,
Every time Double Ninth arrives, I drink this cup.

Lovable are the yellow flowers without worldly airs,
Where the drinker sits, they send forth their fragrance. <139>

**Summary**

This short poem by Sŏkkye describes the author's annual ritual of drinking wine in Yongsan on the Double Ninth Festival (Chungyangjeol), a tradition observed for ten years. The poet admires the simple beauty and fragrance of the yellow chrysanthemums, finding them pure and unpretentious. From a historical perspective, the poem subtly reveals the continuation of traditional Korean customs like celebrating Chungyangjeol even under colonial rule. It offers a personal, reflective moment focused on nature and tradition, potentially contrasting with or providing solace from the realities of the era. The specific mention of Yongsan, a significant area in Seoul known for Japanese military presence, adds another layer, potentially positioning this personal reflection within a loaded geographical space.
