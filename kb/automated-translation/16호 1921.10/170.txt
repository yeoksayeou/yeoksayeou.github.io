北漢의 一日
						文一平

Recently, a trend of enjoying famous mountains and waters has become popular in our society. Many gentlemen visit Kŭmgangsan, and others explore Chadusan. This is evidence that the general public's appreciation for natural beauty has improved; how could this not be a delightful phenomenon?

However, being constrained by material concerns, travel far away is difficult for us. Thus, we decided to climb Pukhan Mountain at least once, being just a stone's throw from Kyŏngsŏng. Accompanied by Tandan'ja, we set out on a certain clear morning in the middle of the seventh month. Carrying some food items prepared for lunch, we proceeded at a cow's pace out of Chahamun Gate. Pointing out the mountains and waters to the left and right, we reached Kugi-dong in Koyang County. Here, fruit trees flourished, and with the superb view of Pukhan Mountain as a backdrop, thatched cottages dotted here and there along the ten-ri clear stream, faintly veiled among trees of deep jade and light green, created the appearance of a vivid living painting.

Though merely a footstep from the capital, this pure environment, unstained by red dust (紅塵), is the ancestral home where Tandan'ja lived for generations. Therefore, even the cowherds leading calves along the road were mostly old acquaintances who greeted us with smiling faces. Observing this from the side, I too felt a certain pleasure.

Among the many beautiful sights in the vicinity, the colors of the brilliantly ripe apples (林檎) and the sound of the murmuring stream (潺湲) flowing by might be the representative pure scenery; they nearly captured our entire aesthetic sense.

Perhaps moved by this affection while admiring the apples, Tandan'ja suddenly went into a relative's thatched cottage by the roadside. I sat alone by the stream, washing my feet (濯足).

After a while, Tandan'ja came running towards me with a bundle of apples wrapped in a cloth, smiling, and sat cross-legged on a white stone. In the quiet stillness of the surrounding forested valley, only the babbling sound of the stream (溪聲) was audible. A single green frog leaped out of the water, staring with wide eyes (雙目), listening to the flowing waves, which also seemed very interesting. We then shared the apples and watched the green frog's seated meditation (坐禪) intently. After a good while, the green frog jumped back into the water<98> and vanished without a trace. A few steps away, a farmer lay stretched out on a wide stone, his back to the green shade, bathing in the clear breeze, likely trying to take a noon nap, his mind and body fatigued from half a day's labor.

Having thus idled away several hours here, we continued our march directly towards our destination. The scorching sun of approaching noon wrung out sweat like sauce from our entire bodies, soaking both our straw hats and ramie clothes. We soon took off our hats and clothes, slung them over one shoulder, and singing long and short songs, crossed a mountain, and then another mountain. We sought out a clear stream in a secluded valley, first washing our faces and hands (洗漱), then bathing (沐浴), indulging in several hours of refreshing clarity. We experienced that even among humans, the pure land's paradise exists.

Tandan'ja, unable to contain his pure delight, sat meditating (坐禪) naked on a rock and created hills and valleys with fine sand, solely striving to elicit a laugh. After finishing this play, he washed his sweat-soaked ramie clothes in the flowing water and dried them (曬) on a stone. At this time, I lay down by the stream, covering my face with my straw hat to block the direct sunlight, peeking at the leisurely clouds in the vast sky, and journeyed for a short while to the land of Huaxu (華胥之國 - land of dreams). Tandan'ja, cherishing every moment, did not waste even fragments of time and composed a *sijo* (Korean verse form):

> The place I came with my friend is water amidst the mountains,
> Beneath a thin cloud canopy, a wide stone is spread out,
> Washed bodies, rinsed clothes, laid out together, greet the wind.

I followed up by composing a five-character quatrain in classical Chinese:

> 浴罷淸溪上, 看雲澹忘機. 行行山日晩, 林露欲輕霏.
> (After bathing above the clear stream, / Watching clouds, placidly forgetting schemes. / Walking on, the mountain sun sets late, / Forest dew begins to lightly fall.)

The two of us got up again and climbed a rugged stone path (石逕) for five or six *ri* to reach Sŭngga-gul (僧伽窟 - Sŭngga Cave/Monastery). This is an ancient Samhan temple founded by the Silla stone monk (石僧) Sut'ae (秀台). In the early Koryŏ period, Taeryanggun Sun (大良君詢), at the tender age of 12, fleeing the poisonous hand of Empress Dowager Ch'ŏnch'u (千秋太后), entered the priesthood. He stayed his pilgrim's staff (錫杖) in this stone cave and inscribed verses of self-pity, setting them adrift on the spring stream. Later, he inherited the throne from King Mokchong (穆宗), repelled the Khitan invasion (丹寇) with a single sword stroke, and became the wise king who secured the foundation of the Koryŏ dynasty for half a millennium—this was King Hyŏnjong (顯宗). Not only that, but afterwards, successive monarchs and queen consorts, when visiting Namgyŏng (南京 - Hanyang), often paid visits to Sŭngga-gul. Thus, the buildings must have been splendid and imposing at that time. However, due to the ephemeral wind and rain, the grand temple (大琳宮) where gold and jade once gleamed has entirely returned to ruins (丘墟), its former appearance impossible to see again. What exists now are merely a few monastic buildings (蘭若) rebuilt 40 years ago through the vow of Empress Myŏngsŏng (明成皇后).

North of the Dharma Hall is Sŭngga-gul, a naturally formed cavern (洞穴) shaped like a stone chamber (石室). The entrance is wide enough for two or three people to pass through side-by-side, but the cave's length is deep, reaching almost several tens of paces. Therefore, even during the day, it is quite dark, making it difficult to distinguish things close by. Lighting a candle we had prepared,<99> Tandan'ja led the way, and I followed behind to the very end. A medicinal spring (藥泉) gushing from the rock base was overflowing the stone well (石井) like fermenting (醱醅) green wine. Placing the candle on a nearby stone, we took out small gourds (小瓢子) from our pockets and each scooped and drank (掬飮) a cup of the medicinal spring water. Its taste was blandly sweet yet clear and cold (淸冽), evoking in the drinker a kind of indescribable spiritual feeling (靈感).

The stream from Sŭngga-gul still trickles (涓涓) today, but the royal grandson who floated his verses back then is gone without a trace (蹤跡寂寞). When I asked a temple monk about the past events, he was completely ignorant (暗昧) and couldn't utter a word. But when asked the price of a meal, he instantly replied, "Seventy *chŏn* per table." That the level (程度) of monks is this low (低級) is truly cause for bemused laughter (悶笑). Tandan'ja, moved by this, composed his feelings:

> The old king (님검) is gone, are the monks too no longer present?
> Asking about olden times, he feigns ignorance, but "How much for the meal?" (밥갑은 암만요)
> Never mind, the taste of the spring in the cave is Sŭngga for a thousand years (즈믄해).

I then composed a five-character quatrain in classical Chinese:

> 行到僧伽窟, 泉流自古今. 王孫何處在, 只見刦灰深.
> (Walking to Sŭngga-gul, / The spring flows from ancient times to now. / Where is the royal grandson? / Only deep ashes of kalpas are seen.)

A few hundred steps northwest of Sŭngga-gul, amidst a thicket (林藪), one can see a towering stone statue (巍然한 石像) soaring (聳立) towards the clouds; it is commonly called P'unggyŏng-am (風磬巖 - Wind Bell Rock). Going closer to examine it carefully (審視), it is a Buddha image carved (彫刻) into a natural rock. Its height must be nearly eight or nine *chim* (尋 - fathom, approx. 1.8m), its width several tens of *ch'ŏk* (尺 - foot, approx. 30cm). The sunshade (遮陽) worn on its head is large enough to cover several *kan* (間 - bay, unit of area), and wind bells (風磬) hang on the left and right; this is likely the origin of the common name. In the *Angyŏpki* (盎葉記), written by the erudite scholar Yi Tŏngmu (李雅亭德懋) of King Chŏngjo's time, it says: "In the stone cave of Sŭnggasa Temple on Samgaksan Mountain, there is a stone statue. Its face is like an old woman's, the head covering resembles a Confucian scholar's headcloth (幅巾), and behind it is a stone screen like a lotus flower. On the back is carved 'Kapcha, 4th year of T'aep'yŏng (太平四年甲子)'. According to the *Koryŏsa* (高麗史), the Kapcha year, the 15th year of King Hyŏnjong, used the Khitan era name, which was the 4th year of T'aep'yŏng under Emperor Shengzong (聖宗隆緖), and the 2nd year of the Tiansheng era of Emperor Renzong of Song (宋仁宗天聖二年). From the present Kyŏngja year (庚子 - 1900 or 1960, likely context implies 1900 here making the calculation ~880 years, text says 817, maybe calculation based on earlier date), it is thirteen Kapcha cycles, totaling 817 years. The *Yŏji Sŭngnam* (輿地勝覽) states this is an image of the ascetic Sut'ae (秀台道人像)." Viewed from this perspective, P'unggyŏng-am is clearly an image of the ascetic Sut'ae made during the Koryŏ period. However, in the rebuilding record by Yi Kyu (李䫨 - perhaps Yi Kyu-bo) of Koryŏ, it says: "According to the collected works of Ch'oe Ch'i-wŏn (崔致遠文集), long ago, the monk Sut'ae of Silla's Nangjŏk-sa Temple (狼跡寺僧秀台), having deeply heard of the Master's holy traces, selected a scenic spot on the southern face of Samgaksan, opened up the rock to make a cave, and carved the stone to model the form. The Master's virtuous image further illuminated the Eastern Land. Whenever the nation faced cosmic changes or disasters like floods or droughts, praying to it for relief brought immediate response." Based on this, P'unggyŏng-am is clearly an image of a certain eminent monk who was Sut'ae's master, made during the Silla period. Now, these two accounts each have their evidence (憑據), and it is difficult to hastily judge (遽斷) which is right and which is wrong. However, since Koun (孤雲 - Ch'oe Ch'i-wŏn) precedes A-jŏng (雅亭 - Yi Tŏngmu) by a long time, he had the benefit of being closer to the events of that time. Therefore, we can only recognize it as somewhat more accurate. Thus, it seems reasonable to say that this P'unggyŏng-am is not a Koryŏ creation but a Silla creation, and not an image of Sut'ae but of <100> his master, some eminent monk. Tandan'ja recited his inspired thoughts:

> The Buddha carved (사긴) on the large rock is almost ten *kil* (길 - fathom/height of a person) tall,
> The canopy stuck (꼬진) above the brow, how many sections (몃간) would it be seen as?
> What rings are the two wind bells (風磬), a single sound of a thousand years (즈믄 해).

I then composed a five-character quatrain in classical Chinese:

> 空山風雨裏, 石佛幾多春, 千界皆流轉, 獨能不壞身.
> (In the empty mountain, amidst wind and rain, / How many springs has the stone Buddha seen? / A thousand realms all flow and turn, / Only it possesses an indestructible body.)

Moving our steps, we ascended Pibong (碑峰 - Stele Peak). I felt dizzy (眩暉) and sat down midway, while only Tandan'ja pushed onward, took off his straw sandals, and climbed the stone steps (石磴). After a while, Tandan'ja returned happily, having measured (尺量) the stele:

> Stele height four *ch'ŏk* nine *ch'on*, *kwan* (丱 - stele top projection) height two *ch'on* eight *pun*, width two *ch'ŏk* three *ch'on* seven *pun*, thickness five *ch'on* seven *pun*.

The stele body (碑軆) is sturdy granite, but over long ages, worn by wind and rain (風磨雨削), eroded by moss and lichen (苔蝕蘚着), the stele face is completely worn away (剝落). Not a single character of the inscription remains (殘存). The only remaining part is the two lines of 47 characters carved (사긴) by Kim Chŏng-hŭi (金秋史正喜) on the left side of the stele. Even of that, eight characters in the first line are worn away (磨削) and undecipherable. What is completely visible is:

> 新羅眞興大王巡狩之碑丙子七月金正喜(以下 8箇字는 磨削不辨함)
> (Silla King Chinhŭng the Great's Border Inspection Tour Stele. Pyŏngja 7th Month Kim Chŏng-hŭi [Following 8 characters worn away, undecipherable])
> 丁丑六月八日 金正喜趙寅永同來審定殘字 六十八字
> (Chŏngch'uk 6th Month 8th Day. Kim Chŏng-hŭi and Cho In-yŏng came together to examine and determine the remaining characters: sixty-eight characters)

Chŏngch'uk (丁丑) was 105 years before the present (1921 - 105 = 1817). If 68 characters of the inscription still remained at that time, then why were characters preserved for the previous 1,000 years obliterated (滅泐) in merely the subsequent 100 years? Perhaps the stele cap (碑盖) that protected it from wind and rain was broken (破碎), causing the erosion (磨削) to become even more severe. Doesn't the damage to the stele's top projection (丱子) and body further prove this fact? The *Kyŏngsŏng Kiryak* (京城記畧) states that King Chinhŭng's inscription comprised 12 lines, but was worn away (滅泐) and undecipherable, though what could be discerned was in the first line "Record of King Chinhŭng and his assembled officials' inspection tour" (眞興王及衆臣等巡狩時記) and in the eighth line the four characters "Lord of Namch'ŏn Commandery" (南川軍主). Viewed from the first line, this could be said to have been erected when the border was demarcated (拓定) in the 16th year of King Chinhŭng. However, based on the eighth line, it might have been erected (樹立) later. Citing the *Silla Pon'gi* (新羅本記) and *Tongsa Kangmok* (東史綱目), it ultimately concludes (譣斷 - likely 臆斷, 'conjecture') that it was erected around the same time as the Hwangch'oryŏng Stele (黃草嶺碑), built in the 29th year of King Chinhŭng. However, in my humble opinion (管見), even if the stele was initially erected during King Chinhŭng's reign, if it wasn't rebuilt in a later age, how could the posthumous title (謚號) "Chinhŭng" have been used? No matter how I think about it, inscribing a posthumous title on a stele during one's lifetime is something no person with common sense could insist (固執) upon. Thus, it is clearly attributable (系함) to a later rebuilding (重建).
Saying it was rebuilt later does not, of course, diminish its status as an ancient stele in the slightest. <101> Together with the Hwangch'oryŏng Stele to the north and the Kaya County Stele to the south, this Pukhansan Stele constitutes the three great boundary steles of Silla's King Chinhŭng. At the same time, it stands facing the Koguryŏ Hot'aewang Stele (高句麗好太王碑), which stands uniquely far away by the vast Amnok River (鴨綠水) in Tonggu (洞溝), speaking of great historical facts across the millennia.

According to legend, at the beginning of our dynasty (國朝 - Chosŏn), the Royal Preceptor Muhak (王師無學), seeking to select the site for the Hanyang palace, descended (踏下) from Samgaksan Mountain and reached the southwestern foot, where he discovered an ancient stele of Tosŏn (道詵) bearing the six characters "Muhak mistakenly sought and reached this place" (無學誤尋到此). Could this possibly be a misidentification (錯認) of this King Chinhŭng Stele?
Tandan'ja composed his feelings:

> The traces left by Silla's King Chinhŭng too,
> Just as they were about to fade away, sixty-eight characters remained, they say,
> But now even what Ch'usa (秋史氏) carved (사긴) is becoming faint (흐리단 말가)?

I followed with a five-character quatrain in classical Chinese:

> 眞興王已去, 石老白雲間, 無語斜陽立, 蒼凉北漢山.
> (King Chinhŭng is already gone, / The stone ages amidst white clouds. / Wordless it stands in the slanting sun, / Desolate Pukhan Mountain.)

Before long, the evening sun sank behind distant peaks, and twilight descended upon the nearby woods. Nesting birds had already settled, and travelers had vanished from the paths. The surrounding night sky was profoundly silent (森寂), with only the murmuring conversation of the two of us.

Tandan'ja formerly called himself Nong'u (農牛 - Farming Cow), generally urging himself (自策) towards faithfulness, simplicity, diligence, and effort. Later, he called himself Ilhaeng (日行 - Daily Practice), signifying striving for substance and practicing diligently (務實力行). Admiring Laozi's humility and the Puritans' strict purity (嚴潔), he also called himself Kyŏlhŏ (潔虛 - Pure Emptiness). To express extreme honesty, he also called himself Changgwang (戇广 - Honest Vastness?). Idealizing the realization of a perfect greater self, he sometimes called himself Si'ah'o (是我乎 - Is This Me?). Then again, Koech'a (塊車 - Lump Cart/Earth Vehicle); interpreted literally, spirit and earth combine to make a lump (一塊), thus, the fleshly vehicle carrying life progresses ceaselessly day and night on the life-path spanning over thirty thousand days. He even marked with circles (圈點) which station on the life-and-death line he had arrived at today. Therefore, since it is difficult to predict (預期) on which day and at which station our spirit will alight, he held the profound view of life that it is best to enjoy life by regarding (看做) each present day as an entire lifetime. Implying (寓) this 'today-ism' (今日主義), he again called himself Ŭng'am (唔庵 - My Day Hermitage), glossing it as "My Day" (吾日) and praising it himself, saying:

> Today that met me
> My day, the bright reality of my day
> I exist and welcome you
> You exist and illuminate (빗내니) me.

His current name, Tandan'ja (斷斷子 - Mr. Decisive/Mr. Severance), signifies negatively the severance of desires (慾斷) and positively decisiveness (果斷). To summarize in one word (一言으로 蔽하면) his journey from the initial Nong'u to the present Tandan'ja, it is evidence of his striving hard with painstaking effort (苦心勞力) to live a life of spirit-flesh unity (靈肉一致); it is the historical symbol (史的 符號) of ten years of inner life. Should his pure character be compared to a lily? The closer one gets, the more one feels a fragrant scent (淸香이 芬馥). Spending a day singing poems and frankly expressing our thoughts (胸衿을 披瀝) with such a simple and refined gentleman amidst famous mountains and waters was something I found most delightful. Walking blindly through the muddy (墑埴冥行) and rugged village path, we reached Se'gŏmjŏng Pavilion (洗劒亭 - Sword-Washing Pavilion), a monument built to commemorate the merit subjects of King Injo's Restoration (仁祖反正功臣). The stream flowing swiftly between the white stones beside the pavilion, washing away (淘盡) the dust of ages (塵刦), narrated滔滔) the events of 300 years past with its long broad tongue (廣長舌). We sat there briefly, quietly listening to the stream's words, and composed a poem:

> 北漢夜歸客, 暫登洗劒亭, 躕躇仍不去, 爲是聽溪聲.
> (A traveler returning from Pukhan at night, / Briefly climbs Se'gŏmjŏng Pavilion. / Hesitating (躕躇), lingers still, / For the sake of listening to the stream's sound.)

Returning home late at night, I treated my fatigue with sound sleep. A single day's wandering in this floating life washed away (滌盡) ten years of vexations. <102>

**Summary**

The author, Mun Ilp'yŏng, recounts a day trip to Pukhan Mountain near Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul) with his companion, identified by the pen name Tandan'ja, in July 1921. They enjoy the natural scenery of Kugi-dong, bathe in a stream, visit Sŭngga-gul cave (associated with King Hyŏnjong of Koryŏ), examine the P'unggyŏng-am statue (discussing its origins - Silla vs. Koryŏ), and climb Pibong peak to see the worn stele of King Chinhŭng of Silla, reflecting on its historical significance and state of decay noted by Kim Chŏng-hŭi. Throughout the journey, they compose poetry (sijo and classical Chinese verse) inspired by the sights and history. The author reflects on Tandan'ja's character and philosophical journey embodied in his changing pen names, concluding with a stop at Se'gŏmjŏng Pavilion before returning home refreshed. From a colonial history perspective, the article is interesting for its focus on Korean natural landscapes and historical sites (Silla, Koryŏ, Chosŏn) as sources of national identity and reflection during a period of Japanese rule. The lament over the decaying Chinhŭng stele and the critique of the worldly monk perhaps subtly reflect contemporary concerns about cultural preservation and spiritual integrity.

北漢의 一日
						文一平
近日 우리 社會에 名山水를 遊賞하는 風潮가 流行하게 되어 金剛山을 探勝하는 人士도 만흐며 自頭山을 探險하는 人士도 잇슴은 天然美에 對하야 一般社會의 趣味가 向上된 表證이니, 어찌 可喜할 現象이 아니랴.
그러나, 우리는 物累에 拘束되어 멀리 旅行하기 難함으로, 京城에서 咫尺인 北漢山이나마, 한번 登覽하리라 決心하고, 斷斷子로 더불어 發往하기는 7月 中旬의, 어느 晴朝이엇섯다. 點心準備로 如干한 食料品을 携帶하고 牛步的 發行으로 紫霞門을 出하야 左右山水를 指點하면서 高陽郡 舊基洞에 이르니, 이곳은 果木이 茂盛하고 北漢山의 秀色을 背景으로 하야, 十里淸溪에 여긔저긔 點綴한 茅屋草堂이 深碧淺綠한 樹木사이로 隱隱히 掩映하야 宛然한 活畵圖를 生하는 觀이 잇다.
首都에서 呎尺이로되 紅塵에, 물드지 아니하는, 이 淸境은 곳 斷斷子의 世居하던 故鄕이라, 그럼으로 路上에 犢을 牽하고 通行하는 牧童까지, 거의 다 舊識이 잇서 笑顔으로 逢迎하니 이를 傍觀하는 나도 一種 快感이 生하얏다.
附近一帶에 美觀이 만흔 中에도 燦爛히 익은 林檎의 色彩와, 潺湲히 흐르는 溪水의 音響이, 代表的 淸景이 될지며, 딸아 우리 審美心의 거의 全部를 奪去하게 되엇다.
이가티 林檎을 愛賞하던 情이 食指를 動하게 함인지, 斷斷子는 忽然이 路傍에 잇는 自己姻戚의 草堂으로 들어가니, 나는 홀로 溪水邊에 안저 濯足하고 잇섯다.
이윽고 斷斷子가 한 褓子에 林檎을 싸들고, 나를 向하야 微笑하면서 走來하야, 힌돌 우에 踞坐하니, 四圍 靜寂한 林壑에 오즉 溪聲이 聒聒할 뿐이라. 一匹靑蛙가 잇서 水中으로 跳出하야 雙目을 瞠하고 流波를 聽함도, 매우 興味잇게 보인다. 이에 林檎을 共啖하며 靑蛙의 坐禪을 熟視하더니, 良久에 그 靑蛙가 다시 水中으로 跳入하야＜98＞ 痕跡조차 업서젓다. 數步를 隔하야 넓은 石上에 綠陰을 등지고 淸風으로 洗潄하면서 橫臥하야 잇는 田夫는 아마도 半日勞役에 心身이 疲困하야 午夢을 試하는 模樣이다.
이럭저럭, 이곳서 數刻을 虛費하고 바로 目的地를 向하야 行進을 繼續하니 午天이 將近한 暴陽은 全身에서 汗醬을 絞出하야 麥帽와 苧衣를 다 적심으로, 곳 衣帽를 脫하야 一肩에 擔하고 長嘯短歌로 山을 越하고 또 山을 越하야 幽谷에 잇는 淸溪를 차저가 먼저 洗漱하고 이어 沐浴하야 數時間의 淸快를 貪하니 人間에도 淨土의 極樂이 잇슴을 實驗하얏노라.
斷斷子는 淸興을 이기지 못하야 裸軆로 巖石에 坐禪도 하며 細沙로 丘壑을 創造도 하야, 오로지 一笑를 博得하기만 힘쓰더니 이 遊戱를 畢한 後에는 汗霑한 苧衣를 流水에 洗濯하야서 石上에 曬한다. 이때 나는 溪邊에 偃臥하야 麥帽도 面部를 덥허 光線의 直射를 遮斷하고 長天의 閒雲을 管窺하면서 暫時동안 華胥의 國에 往遊할 새 寸陰을 애끼는 斷斷子는 時間의 碎屑을 버리지 안코 詩調 한 首를 지엇다.

벗 모시고 이른 곳이 메ㅅ속에 물이로다,
엷은 구름 차일 알에 넓은 돌이 펼쳣스니,
시츤 몸 빨은 옷이 한꾀 널려 바람마지.

나는 漢詩五言絶句를 追吟하니

浴罷淸溪上, 看雲澹忘機. 行行山日晩, 林露欲輕霏.

2人이 다시 起身하야 5,6里되는 崎嶇한 石逕을 攀登하야 僧伽窟에 到하니, 이는 新羅石僧인 秀台란 이가 刱建한 三韓古刹이라 高麗初葉에 이르러는 大良君詢이 12歲의 幼冲으로 千秋太后의 毒手를 避하야 出家하얏슬 時에 그 錫杖을 이 石窟에 住하고 自傷하는 詩句를 題하야서 泉流에 付하더니 後에 穆宗의 大統을 入承하야 丹寇의 來侵을 一劒으로 擊退하고 高麗半千年의 國基를 奠安한 英君이 되니 곳 顯宗이다. 뿐 아니라, 그 後에도 歷代의 君主와 后嬪이 南京(漢陽)에 遊幸할 時는 흔이 僧伽窟에 叅觀하얏슨즉 當時에 응당 建築도 華麗壯嚴하얏스련만 無常한 風雨에 金碧이 交映하던 大琳宮도 그 全部가 이미 丘墟에 歸하야 昔日의 面影을 다시 볼 수 업고 只今 잇는 것은 40年 前에 明成皇后의 發願으로 重建한 數棟의 蘭若에 不過할 뿐이다.
法堂의 北方에 僧伽窟이 잇스니 石室模樣으로 된 天作의 洞穴이라 入口의 廣은 2,3人이 並立하야 通行할만 하나 洞長이 深邃하야 거의 數十步에 達함으로 晝間에도 오히려 暗黑하야 咫尺을 分辨키 難할 새 豫備하얏던 蠟燭에＜99＞ 點火하야 들고 斷斷子는 先導하며 나는 尾從하야 終點까지 들어가 보니 岩根으로 湧出하는 藥泉이, 바야흐로 醱醅되는 綠酒와 가티 石井에 盈溢하야 흐르거늘, 蠟燭을 傍石上에 着立하고 懷中에서 小瓢子를 取出하야 藥泉을 각각 한 盞식 掬飮한즉, 그 味가 淡甘하고도 淸冽하야 飮者로 一種 形容치 못할 靈感을 動케 한다.
僧伽窟의 泉流야 今日에도 依然히 涓涓하지만 當年에 詩句를 泛하던 王孫은 蹤跡이 寂寞하다. 往蹟을 寺僧에게 問한대 全然히 暗昧하야 一言을 發치 못하더니 食價를 問한즉 한 床에 70錢이라고 卽答하니 僧侶의 程度가, 이러틋 低級임은 참 悶笑할 바라. 斷斷子-因하야 感懷를 賦하니

옛님검 가셧거니 스님조차 다시 업나?
옛일 무러 모르세의중 「밥갑은 암만요」
두어라 굴속의 한샘 맛이 즈믄해 僧伽로다.

나는 또 漢詩五絶을 構成하니

行到僧伽窟, 泉流自古今. 王孫何處在, 只見刦灰深.

僧伽窟에서 西北으로 百數十步되는 林藪間에 巍然한 石像이 잇서 雲表에 聳立하얏슴을 見할 것이니, 俗稱 風磬巖일다. 그 압헤 가서 審視한즉 天然石에 佛像을 彫刻하얏는데 長이 거의 8, 9尋이 되겟스며, 廣이 數十尺이 되겟스며 頭上에 戴한 遮陽은 그 大가 數間에 達할지오 左右에 風磬이 달렷스니, 아마 이것이 俗名의 起因인 듯 하다. 正宗時의 博學인 李雅亭德懋의 著述한 盎葉記에는 「三角山僧伽寺石窟有石像, 顔如老嫗, 蒙頭之物恰如儒家幅巾, 背有石障若蓮花, 後刻太平四年甲子, 按高麗史, 顯宗十五年甲子行契丹年號, 卽聖宗隆緖太平四年, 而宋仁宗天聖二年也, 距今庚子十三甲子, 摠八百十七年, 輿地勝覽此乃秀台道人像,」이라 하얏스니 此로 觀하면 風磬巖이 高麗時代에 製作한 秀台道人의 像됨이 分明하다. 그러나 高麗李䫨의 重修記에는 「按崔致遠文集, 昔有新羅狼跡寺僧秀台, 飫聆大師之聖跡, 選勝于三角之南面, 開巖作窟, 刻石模形, 大師道容益照東土, 國家如有乾坤之變水早之災, 禱以禳之無下立應」이라 하얏스니 此를 據하면 風磬巖이 新羅時代에 製作한 秀台道人의 先師되는 어느 高僧의 像됨이 分明하다. 今에 前後二說이 各其 憑據가 잇서, 孰是孰非를 遽斷키 難하나 孤雲이 雅亭에 北하야 年代가 久遠한이만콤 當時事實에 接近할 便益이 잇슴으로, 얼마쯤 더 正確하다 認定할 수 밧게 업슨즉 이 風磬巖이 高麗時代의 製作이 아니오, 新羅時代의 製作이며, 秀台의 像이 아니오＜100＞ 그 先師되는 어느 高僧의 像이라 함이 理에 當할 듯 하다. 斷斷子-感興을 吟하니

큰 바위에 사긴부텨 거의 거의 열 길이라,
이마 우에 꼬진 채양 몃간으로 볼 것이다,
우느니 두 개 風磬이 즈믄 해의 한소리.

나는 또 漢詩五絶을 構成하니

空山風雨裏, 石佛幾多春, 千界皆流轉, 獨能不壞身.

步를 移하야 碑峰에 上할 새 나는 眩暉이 나서 中途에 안저 잇고 斷斷子만 奮發하야 草鞋들 脫하고서 石磴을 攀登하얏다. 이윽고 斷斷子-碑를 尺量하야 가지고 欣然히 回歸하니

碑高四尺九寸, 丱高二寸八分, 廣二尺三寸七分, 厚五寸七分,

碑軆는 堅强한 花崗石이나 悠久한 歲月에 風磨雨削하며 苔蝕蘚着하야 碑面이 全혀 剝落하얏슴으로 碑文은 1字도 殘存치 아니하고 오즉 殘存한 것은 金秋史正喜의 사긴 碑石左側에 잇는 兩行47字뿐인데, 그것이나마 第1行에는 8箇字가 磨削되어 分辨치 못하겟고 完全히 보이는 것은 즉

新羅眞興大王巡狩之碑丙子七月金正喜(以下 8箇字는 磨削不辨함)
丁丑六月八日 金正喜趙寅永同來審定殘字 六十八字

이라 丁丑은 距金105年前인즉, 이때까지 碑文이 68字이나 殘存하얏다 하니 그러면 旣往 1,000年에 保存된 것이 겨우 爾後百年에 滅泐됨은 무슨 까닭인고. 아마도 風雨를 防禦하던 碑盖가 破碎되어 磨削이 一層 甚하게 된 것 갓다. 碑頂의 丱子와 碑軆의 破傷이 더욱 이런 事實을 證明치 아니하는가. 京城記畧에는 이르되 眞興王의 碑文이 무릇 12行인데 滅泐하야 分辨치 못하겟스되 可辨할 것은 그 第1行에 「眞興王及衆臣等巡狩時記」라 하고 第8行에는 「南川軍主」의 4字가 잇스니 第一行으로 觀하면 此는 곳 眞興王 16年에 疆界를 拓定할 時에 建한 바이라 할지나 第8行을 據하면 그 後에 樹立하얏는지도 未可知라 하야 新羅本記와 東史綱目을 引證하고 最終에는 眞興王 29年에 建한 黃草嶺碑와 前後하야서 建한 것이라 譣斷하얏스나 吾의 管見으로는 碑石의 初建은 비록 眞興王의 御世中에 在하얏스되 後世에 重建한 것이 아니면 어찌 眞興이란 謚號를 썻슬가, 아무리 생각하야도 生前에 謚號를 碑刻하얏다고는 常識잇는 者의 固執치 못할 바인즉 畢竟 後世의 重建에 系함이 分明하다.
後世 重建이라 함이, 족음도 古碑됨에는 損傷되지 아니할 것은 勿論이라.＜101＞ 저 北으로 黃草嶺碑와 南으로 伽耶郡碑와 한끠, 이 北漢山碑가 新羅眞興王의 三大境界碑가 되는 同時에 멀리 鴨綠水가 汪洋하는 저 洞溝에 特立하야 잇는 高句麗好太王碑와 서로 對立하야서 千古의 大史實을 語하는도다.
傳說에 이르되 國朝初에 王師無學이 漢陽宮址를 選定하려 하야 三角山으로부터 踏下하야 西南麓에 이르러 「無學誤尋到此」의 6字가 잇는 道詵의 古碑를 發見하얏다 하니, 혹, 이 眞興王碑를 錯認한 것이 아닌가.
斷斷子는 感懷를 賦하니

新羅에도 眞興王의 그 자최를 끼친 것이,
거의 거의 꺼저갈 때 六十八字 잇섯다고,
秋史氏의 사긴 것이 또 다시 흐리단 말가.

나는 漢詩五絶을 딸아지으니

眞興王已去, 石老白雲間, 無語斜陽立, 蒼凉北漢山.

이윽고 夕陽이 遠峀에 잠기고 暝色이 近林에 날 때에 山路를 下하야 平地에 이르니 宿鳥는 벌서 깃을 定하고 行人은 이미 길에 絶하야 周圍의 夜空이 森寂한데 2人의 言語만 두런두런할 뿐이다.
斷斷子는 旣往에 自號를 農牛라 하니 대개 忠實淳朴하며 勤勉努力함으로써 自策함이오 厥後에 日行이라 自號하니 務實力行함을 意味함이오 老子의 謙虛와 淸敎徒의 嚴潔을 思慕하야 潔虛이라기도 하며 極端正直을 表示하기 爲하야 戇广이라기도 하며 完美한 大我實現을 理想하야 是我乎라기도 하다가, 다시 塊車-라 하니 字義로 解釋하면 土에 魂을 合하야 一塊를 作하얏슨즉 곳 生命을 태운 肉車가 三萬餘日 가는 人生行路에 日夜로 間斷업시 行進하야 今日은 生死線第幾驛에 到着하얏다고 스스로 圈點을 付한 일도 잇섯다. 그럼으로 우리 神이 何日何站에서 下車할는지 預期키 難한즉, 아못조록 今日今日을 곳 一平生으로 看做하야 生을 樂함이 可하다는 深刻한 人生觀이 잇서 今日主義를 寓하야 다시 唔庵이라 하니 字解하면 吾日이라 스스로 頌歌하야 가르되.

나를 맛난 오늘
내날 現實 밝은 내날
내 잇서 너를 반기고
네 잇서 나를 빗내니.

라고 하얏다. 今日에 斷斷子라 함은 消極으론 慾斷과 積極으론 果斷을 가르침이니 最初 農牛로부터 現今  斷斷子라 稱하기까지 一言으로 蔽하면 靈肉一致의 生活을 하기 爲하야 苦心勞力하야온 表證이니 곳 10年間 內的 生活의 史的 符號이라 그 潔白한 品格은 百合花에 比할가. 接近할스록 淸香이 芬馥하는 感이 잇다. 이런 澹泊한 人士로 더부러 名山水間에 1日동안 嘯吟하며, 서로 胸衿을 披瀝함을 得함은, 가장 愉快히 여기는 바라. 崎嶇한 村路를 墑埴冥行하야 洗劒亭에 이르니 이는 仁祖反正功臣의 記念建築이라. 그 亭畔白石사이로 飛流하야 塵刦을 淘盡하는 溪水는 그 廣長舌로 300年往事를 滔滔히 說去하거늘 이에 暫時 안저서 그 溪水의 言을 靜聽하며 一詩를 吟하니

北漢夜歸客, 暫登洗劒亭, 躕躇仍不去, 爲是聽溪聲.

深夜에 歸家하야 熟睡로써 疲困함을 醫治하니 浮生一日의 逍遙가 10年의 煩惱를 滌盡하얏다.＜102＞
