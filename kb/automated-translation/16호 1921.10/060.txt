Master T'oegye's New Diagram of the Heavenly Mandate

I. New Diagram and Explanation of the Heavenly Mandate
Question: May I hear the meaning of the Heavenly Mandate? Answer: Heaven (天) is Principle (*li*, 理). Its virtues are four: Origin (元), Flourishing (亨), Advantage (利), and Firmness (貞). The reality of these four is Sincerity (誠). That is, Origin is the principle of beginning; Flourishing is the principle of prevalence; Advantage is the principle of fulfillment; Firmness is the principle of completion. And that which makes them circulate without cease is none other than the marvel of truthfulness and freedom from falsehood, which is called Sincerity. Therefore, amidst the flowing transformation of the Two [Forces, Yin and Yang] and the Five [Agents, *ohaeng*], these four are always inherent within, serving as the source of the mandate for things. Thus, all things that receive the *ki* (氣) of Yin-Yang and the Five Agents to form their shape invariably possess the principles of Origin, Flourishing, Advantage, and Firmness as their Nature (*sŏng*, 性). The items of this Nature are five: Benevolence (仁), Righteousness (義), Propriety (禮), Wisdom (智), and Trustworthiness (信). Therefore, the Four Virtues and the Five Constants are a single principle, above and below, never divided between Heaven and humans. However, the reason for the differences between sages, the ignorant, humans, and other creatures lies in *ki*. It is not the original state of Origin, Flourishing, Advantage, and Firmness. Thus, Zisi (子思) directly stated, "What Heaven mandates is called Nature," referring to the source of the wondrous union of the Two and Five, and pointing to the Four Virtues. Principle is fundamentally one; why do its virtues amount to four? Answer: Principle is the Great Ultimate (*t'aegŭk*, 太極). Within the Great Ultimate, there is originally no thing; how could there initially be names for Four Virtues? However, viewed after its flowing operation, there must be its beginning. If there is a beginning, there must be its prevalence. If there is prevalence, there must be its fulfillment. If there is fulfillment, there must be its completion. Thus, it begins and prevails, prevails and fulfills, fulfills and completes, and thereby the names of the Four Virtues are established. Therefore, speaking of it synthetically, it is just one Principle. Speaking of it analytically, there are these four principles. Thus, Heaven mandates the myriad things with one Principle, and each of the myriad things possesses one principle; this is it.

Right, First Section: Discussing the Principle of the Heavenly Mandate
Question: Since Heaven possesses the Four Virtues and mandates the myriad things, what then is the way of the so-called Five Agents (*ohaeng*, 五行)? Answer: Between Heaven and Earth, there are Principle (*li*) and Material Force (*ki*). As soon as there is Principle, there is an indication of *ki*. As soon as there is *ki*, Principle follows it. Principle is the master of *ki*; *ki* is the servant of Principle, thereby achieving the work of Heaven and Earth. What is called Principle are the Four Virtues. What is called *ki* are the Five Agents. In the process of flowing transformation, Origin is the principle of beginning things, so the *ki* of Wood (木) receives it and generates. Flourishing is the principle of things prevailing, so the *ki* of Fire (火) receives it and grows. Advantage is the principle of things fulfilling, so the *ki* of Metal (金) receives it and reaps. Firmness is the principle of things completing, so the *ki* of Water (水) receives it and stores. Earth (土) flourishes equally in all four seasons. This is how Heaven possesses the Four Virtues and Five Agents and completes its Way.

Right, Second Section: Discussing the *Ki* of the Five Agents <34>

Question: That Heaven completes its Way through the Four Virtues and Five Agents is indeed so. But in the diagram, the Four Virtues and Five Agents are placed in the same position and written together, with the Five Agents written in circles within Yin and Yang, and the Four Virtues written in circles within that. Why is this? Answer: Outside Principle, there is no *ki*; outside *ki*, there is no Principle. They certainly cannot be separated for an instant. Yet their distinction also cannot be confused without differentiation. Moreover, Yin-Yang and the Five Agents are fundamentally not two different things. Therefore, the Five Agents are placed within Yin-Yang, necessarily containing the Four Virtues, to show that the Five Agents are one Yin-Yang, each possessing its specific nature. The Four Virtues are written in circles within the Five Agents to show that Principle ultimately does not depart from *ki*, and yet is also not identical to *ki*.

Right, Third Section: Discussing the Distinction between Principle and Material Force (*li* and *ki*)
Question: It was stated that Origin is the principle of beginning things, and the *ki* of Wood receives it and generates. Then the source of generating things should originate from Wood. Why then, in the diagram, does it necessarily originate from Water? Answer: Origin is indeed the principle of beginning things, and Wood is also the *ki* that generates things. But the principle that constitutes Origin comes not from Origin but from Firmness. The *ki* that constitutes Wood comes not from Wood but from Water. Therefore, Firmness is the principle of completing things, but it also contains the principle of initiating. Water is the *ki* of storing things, but it also contains the *ki* of generating. This is why Water receives the virtue of Firmness to become the source of generating things. Hence, in the generation of all things, although their form depends on the *ki* of Wood to be completed, the origin that shapes them truly begins with the *ki* of Water. How do we know this is so? Because when things are generated, they initially all first receive the *ki* of Water, gradually condensing, and only after a long time solidifying to take form. Even the generation of Heaven and Earth follows this principle, first forming through the *ki* of Water. The discussions of earlier scholars have already exhausted this point, so I will not elaborate further here. Thus, why should there be any doubt that the origin of generating things stems from Water?

Right, Fourth Section: Discussing the Origin of Generating Things
Question: In the generation of humans and creatures, the Nature they receive is uniformly the Principle of Heaven and Earth, and the form they are endowed with is uniformly the *ki* of Heaven and Earth. In that case, humans and creatures are fundamentally without distinction. Why then, in the diagram of the human form, is the heart entirely white, representing the Five Natures pervading all, while for birds and beasts, a single white line is drawn above and below the circle of Nature, indicating perhaps one path is open, and for plants and trees, the circle of Nature is white but the entire body is black, indicating complete blockage and imperviousness? What is the meaning of this? Answer: Between Heaven and Earth, Principle is one, but *ki* is myriad and unequal. Therefore, investigating their Principle, all myriad things are united in having the same Nature. Discussing their *ki*, the myriad things are divided, each having a distinct *ki*. Why? Principle as Principle, its substance is fundamentally empty (*hŏ*, 虛). Being empty, it has no opposite. Having no opposite, whether in humans or in creatures, it is certainly one, without addition or subtraction. As for *ki*, it initially has the form of Yin and Yang in opposition, mutually serving as each other's root. Thus, within Yin, there cannot but be Yang; within Yang, there cannot but be Yin. Within the Yang of Yin, there cannot but be Yin; within the Yin of Yang, there cannot but be Yang. Its transformations reach tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, yet each cannot lack an opposite. Therefore, for all things receiving this Principle and *ki*, their Nature is without distinction, but their *ki* cannot but differ in terms of correctness (*chŏng*, 正) and partiality (*p'yŏn*, 偏). Hence, in the generation of humans and creatures, those who receive the correct *ki* of Yin and Yang become human. Those who receive the partial *ki* of Yin and Yang become creatures. Since humans receive the correct *ki* of Yin and Yang, it can be known that their physical endowment (*kijil*, 氣質) is pervious and bright. Since creatures receive the partial *ki* of Yin and Yang, it can be known that their physical endowment is obstructed and dark. However, observing humans and creatures, humans are correct and creatures are partial. Observing birds, beasts, plants, and trees, birds and beasts are the correct within the partial, while plants and trees are the partial within the partial. Thus, within the physical endowment of birds and beasts, there may be one path of perviousness. Plants and trees only possess the Principle, being entirely obstructed and impervious. Therefore, the reason why Nature is sometimes pervious and sometimes obstructed is due to the difference of correctness and partiality in *ki*. The reason why the forms are sometimes white and sometimes black is to show the difference of brightness and darkness in *ki*. What other meaning could there be? Why is there a difference in the forms of humans, birds, beasts, plants, and trees being round, square, horizontal, or inverted <35>? Answer: The difference in the forms of humans and creatures is also caused by the two *ki* of Yin and Yang. Because the nature of Yang is compliant and level, while the nature of Yin is contrary and inverted. Therefore, humans, being the excellent children of Heaven and Earth and representing Yang, necessarily have heads like heaven and feet like earth, standing level, straight, and upright. Creatures, being the partial and obstructed children of Heaven and Earth and representing Yin, have forms unlike humans, being either horizontal or inverted. However, birds and beasts are Yang within Yin, so their growth is not entirely inverted but horizontal. Plants and trees are Yin within Yin, so their growth is necessarily contrary and inverted. All this is due to the difference in the endowment of *ki*, caused by the compliant and contrary natures of *ki*.

Right, Fifth Section: Discussing the Distinction between Humans and Creatures
Question: Can the constituents of the human mind (*sim*, 心) be explained separately? Answer: When Heaven confers its mandate upon humans, without this *ki*, there would be no way to lodge this Principle. Without this mind, there would be no way to lodge this Principle and *ki*. Therefore, our mind is empty of principle yet numinous (*ling*, 靈), serving as the abode of Principle and *ki*. Thus, its Principle is the principle of the Four Virtues, becoming the Five Constants. Its *ki* is the *ki* of the Two [Forces] and Five [Agents], becoming the physical endowment (*kijil*). These constituents of the human mind all originate from Heaven. However, the so-called Five Constants are purely good without evil, so the Four Beginnings (*sadan*, 四端) that issue from them are also without exception good. The so-called physical endowment is not the original nature, so the Seven Feelings (*ch'ilchŏng*, 七情) that issue from it easily flow into evil. Thus, although the names Nature (*sŏng*, 性) and Feelings (*chŏng*, 情) are one, the functions of Nature and Feelings must inevitably differ. As for that which encompasses and operates what is called Nature and Feelings, it is none other than the marvel of this mind. Therefore, the mind is the master and constantly governs its Nature and Feelings. This is the general outline of the human mind. Question: Then why are the Feelings outside the circle of the Mind? Answer: The Five Agents should properly be within the circle of Yin and Yang, but in Lianxi's (濂溪 Zhou Dunyi) diagram, they are outside the circle. This was likely done for the sake of the diagram, separating them out of necessity.

Right, Sixth Section: Discussing the Constituents of the Human Mind
Question: Why must the items of Nature and Feelings be listed corresponding exactly to the Four Virtues and Five Agents? Answer: The Five Natures and Four Beginnings of humans indeed correspond to the Four Virtues of Heaven, each having its affiliation. Only the division of the Seven Feelings seems somewhat mismatched. However, extrapolating by category, they too each find a correspondence. For instance, Joy (喜) and Love (愛) belong to Wood, Pleasure (樂) to Fire, Anger (怒) and Hate (惡) to Metal, Sorrow (哀) to Water, and Desire (欲) is assigned to Earth, leaving none out. This is how Heaven and humans form one body.

Right, Seventh Section: Discussing the Items of Nature and Feelings
Question: Below Intention (*ŭi*, 意), there is a division into the Seed of Good (*sŏn'gi*, 善幾) and the Seed of Evil (*akki*, 惡幾). What does this mean? Answer: Intention is what the mind issues forth, and the mind is the master of Nature and Feelings. Therefore, before this mind is aroused, it is like the Great Ultimate possessing the principles of activity and stillness but not yet differentiated into Yin and Yang. Within the single mind, Nature is whole, purely good, and without evil. When this mind has been aroused, it is like the Great Ultimate having already differentiated, with activity becoming Yang and stillness becoming Yin. At this time, *ki* begins to function. Therefore, the arising of feelings cannot be without the distinction of good and evil, and its incipience (*tan*, 端) is extremely subtle. Thereupon, intention, being issued by the mind, also carries the feelings and steers them left or right, either following the impartiality of Heavenly Principle or following the selfishness of human desire. The division between good and evil is decided from this point. This is the meaning of the so-called Seeds of Good and Evil in Intention. Although, the arising of good originates from what is inherent, thus it is straightforward and compliant. The sprouting of evil emerges from what is originally non-existent, thus it is deviant, horizontal, and perverse. This is what Zhao Zhidao's (趙致道) *Diagram of the Seeds of Sincerity* (誠幾圖) was created for, and it is adopted here for explanation.

Right, Eighth Section: Discussing the Seeds of Good and Evil in Intention
Question: That the distinction between perviousness and obstruction in humans and creatures arises from the difference between correctness and partiality in *ki* has already been heard. We humans all receive the correct *ki*. Yet why are there also distinctions among upper intelligence (*sangji*, 上智), average persons (*chungin*, 中人), and lower stupidity (*hau*, 下愚)? Answer: Humans' *ki* is indeed correct, but this *ki* has Yin and Yang, so how could the endowment of their physical nature (*kijil*) be without distinctions of clarity (*ch'ŏng*, 淸) and turbidity (*t'ak*, 濁), purity (*sun*, 粹) and mixedness (*pak*, 駁)? Therefore, when humans are born, they receive *ki* from Heaven, and Heaven's *ki* has clarity and turbidity. They receive physical substance (*chil*, 質) from Earth, and Earth's substance has purity and mixedness. Thus, those endowed with clarity and purity become the upper intelligent. The upper intelligent, regarding Heavenly Principle, understand it clearly and practice it fully, naturally uniting with Heaven. Those endowed with clarity and mixedness, or turbidity and purity, <36> become average persons. Average persons, regarding Heavenly Principle, either have surplus understanding but insufficient practice, or insufficient understanding but surplus practice, beginning to have both accord and discord with Heaven. Those endowed with turbidity and mixedness become the lower stupid. The lower stupid, regarding Heavenly Principle, understand it dimly and practice it deviantly, distancing themselves far from Heaven. These are generally the three grades of human endowment. Although Principle and *ki* mutually depend on each other and are present everywhere, even the mind of the upper intelligent cannot be without issuances from the physical form (*hyŏnggi*, 形氣). Where Principle resides, it is not enriched by intelligence nor impoverished by stupidity, so even in the mind of the lower stupid, the original state of Heavenly Principle cannot be absent. Therefore, the beauty of the physical endowment is something the upper intelligent dare not rely on. The foundation of Heavenly Principle is something the lower stupid ought to fulfill themselves. Thus, Yu (禹) was a great sage, yet Shun (舜) had to encourage him with "Be discriminating, be unified." Yanzi (顔子) was a great worthy, yet the Master (夫子 Confucius) had to guide him with "Broaden learning with culture, restrain it with propriety." As for the *Great Learning* (大學), it concerns the affairs of learners, yet Zengzi (曾子) necessarily provided the instruction of investigating things, extending knowledge, making intentions sincere, and rectifying the mind (格致誠正) for knowing and acting. The *Doctrine of the Mean* (中庸), concerns the affairs of teaching, yet Zisi (子思) necessarily provided the way of choosing the good and holding fast to it (擇善固執) for knowing and acting. Therefore, the Way of learning and inquiry does not depend on the beauty or ugliness of the physical endowment, but solely on whether the knowledge of Heavenly Principle is clear or not, and whether the practice of Heavenly Principle is exhaustive or not.

Right, Ninth Section: Discussing the Endowment of Physical Nature (*kijil*)
Question: What is meant by Reverence (*kyŏng*, 敬) and Preservation and Nurture (*chonyang*, 存養) within the mind, and Scrutiny (*sŏngch'al*, 省察) and Reverence regarding Feelings and Intentions? Answer: When humans receive the mandate from Heaven, that which possesses the principle of the Four Virtues and serves as the master of the whole self is the mind (*sim*, 心). When things and affairs affect one inwardly, that which follows the seeds of good and evil and serves as the function of the single mind are the Feelings and Intentions (*chŏng'ŭi*, 情意). Therefore, the superior person (*kunja*, 君子), when this mind is tranquil, necessarily practices preservation and nurture to maintain its substance (*ch'e*, 體). When feelings and intentions are aroused, they necessarily practice scrutiny to rectify its function (*yong*, 用). However, the principle of this mind is vast and cannot be grasped, whole and boundless. If not unified by Reverence, how can one preserve one's nature and establish its substance? The arousal of this mind is subtle, making discernment difficult like separating hairs, and perilous, making treading hard like avoiding pitfalls. If not unified by Reverence, how again can one rectify its incipient movements and fulfill its function? Therefore, the learning of the superior person, when this mind is not yet aroused, must center on Reverence and add the effort of preservation and nurture. When this mind is already aroused, it must also center on Reverence and add the effort of scrutiny. This is why the learning of Reverence constitutes the beginning and the end, penetrating both substance and function. Thus, the crucial meaning of the diagram lies especially here.

Right, Tenth Section: Discussing the Essentials of Preservation and Scrutiny
The above Diagram and Explanation was completed when the Master was in the capital during the Kyeyu year (癸丑年 1553), finalized through consultation and revision with Master Chŏng (鄭公 Chŏng Chayŏng, known as Kubo 龜峰). Its refined and marvelous points all stem from the Master's own insights. In the spring of the Ŭlmyo year (乙卯春 1555), upon returning south, he devoted much effort to refining and revising it, resulting in significant differences from the initial version. Respectfully transcribed as above based on the old copy. The Master once said, "Its meaning is already complete in the Diagram and Explanation. As for the tenth section, it may be included or omitted." In the spring of the Muo year (戊午春 1558), Cho Muk (趙穆) presented the *Kyŏng Sŏ* (敬書 Book of Reverence).

II. Discourse on the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings
The distinction between Nature (*sŏng*, 性) and Feelings (*chŏng*, 情) has been elucidated in detail by earlier scholars. However, regarding the mention of the Four Beginnings (*sadan*) and Seven Feelings (*ch'ilchŏng*), they are generally both called 'feelings', but I have not seen them explained separately in terms of Principle (*li*, 理) and Material Force (*ki*, 氣). In a previous year, when Master Chŏng created his diagram, there was the theory that the Four Beginnings issue from Principle and the Seven Feelings issue from *ki*. I worried that this distinction might be too sharp and potentially lead to disputes, so I revised the wording to 'purely good' and 'encompassing *ki*', etc. My intention was to facilitate mutual clarification through discussion, not to claim his words were flawless. Now, having received your illuminating explanation, which points out errors with acuity and clarity, I am deeply edified. Yet, there remain points about which I cannot help but be perplexed. Allow me to try expressing them and seek your correction. The Four Beginnings are feelings; the Seven Feelings are also feelings. Since both are feelings, why do they have the distinct names of 'Four' and 'Seven'? Your esteemed reply mentions that *what they are referred to in terms of* differs; this is correct. Fundamentally, Principle and *ki* mutually depend on each other for substance (*ch'e*, 體) and rely on each other for function (*yong*, 用). Certainly, there is no *ki* without Principle, nor Principle without *ki*. However, since *what they are referred to in terms of* differs, distinctions cannot but be made. Since antiquity, when sages and worthies discussed these two, did they invariably conflate them into a single theory without discussing them separately? Furthermore, consider the single character 'Nature' (*sŏng*, 性). When Zisi (子思) spoke of the 'Nature of Heavenly Mandate' <37> and Mencius (孟子) spoke of the 'Nature as Good', what do these two instances of 'Nature' refer to? Do they not, within the endowment of Principle and *ki*, point specifically to the original source of this Principle? Because what is pointed to resides in Principle, not *ki*, it can be called purely good and without evil. If, due to Principle and *ki* being inseparable, one wished to include *ki* in the explanation, it would no longer be the original state of Nature. That Zisi and Mencius, who fully perceived the complete substance of the Way, established their doctrines in this manner was not because they knew one aspect but not the other. It was sincerely because explaining Nature mixed with *ki* would prevent seeing Nature's original goodness. It wasn't until later generations, with the emergence of Masters like Cheng (程子) and Zhang (張子), that the theory of the 'Nature of Physical Endowment' (*kijil chi sŏng*, 氣質之性) arose out of necessity. This too was not seeking novelty by establishing a different view. Since what it referred to was after the endowment at birth, it could not simply be called the original Nature. Therefore, I have presumptuously thought that the division of feelings into Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings is analogous to the difference in Nature between Original Nature (*pon sŏng*, 本性) and the Nature of Physical Endowment (*kijil chi sŏng*). If Nature can thus be explained separately in terms of Principle and *ki*, why can Feelings alone not be explained separately in terms of Principle and *ki*? Commiseration (惻隱), Shame and Dislike (羞惡), Complying and Deferring (辭讓), Right and Wrong (是非) – from where do these arise? They arise from the Nature of Benevolence (仁), Righteousness (義), Propriety (禮), and Wisdom (智). Joy (喜), Anger (怒), Sorrow (哀), Fear (懼), Love (愛), Hate (惡), Desire (欲) – from where do these arise? External things touch one's physical form (*hyŏng*, 形) and stir within, emerging according to circumstances. Regarding the arising of the Four Beginnings, Mencius already called them 'mind' (*sim*, 心), and the mind is certainly a combination of Principle and *ki*. However, *what is referred to* is primarily Principle. Why? The Nature of Benevolence, Righteousness, Propriety, and Wisdom is purely present within, and the four are their incipient manifestations (*tansŏ*, 端緖). Regarding the arising of the Seven Feelings, Chengzi called it 'stirring within' (動於中), and Zhu Xi (朱子) said they 'each have their proper object' (各有攸當), thus they certainly also combine Principle and *ki*. However, *what is referred to* resides in *ki*. Why? When external things arrive, that which is easily affected and first responds is none other than the physical form and *ki* (*hyŏnggi*, 形氣), and the seven are their sprouts and veins (*myomaek*, 苗脉). How could it be that what is purely Principle within becomes mixed *ki* upon arising, while what is externally perceived as physical form and *ki* arises as Principle rather than *ki*? The Four Beginnings are all good. Thus it is said, "One without the mind possessing these four is not human," and "As for their feelings, they can become good." The Seven Feelings are fundamentally good but easily flow into evil. Therefore, only when their arising hits the mean (*chungjŏl*, 中節) are they called 'Harmony' (*hwa*, 和). If one possesses [even one] and fails to scrutinize it, the mind has already lost its correctness. Viewed from this perspective, although both are said not to be separate from Principle and *ki*, if we speak pointing specifically to their respective primary sources based on their origins, why is it not permissible to say 'this one is Principle' and 'that one is *ki*'? Examining your esteemed reply in detail, you deeply perceive the mutual dependence and inseparability of Principle and *ki* and strongly advocate this view. Therefore, you believe there is no *ki* without Principle, nor Principle without *ki*, and assert that the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings have no different meanings. Although this seems close to correct, measured against the intent of the sages and worthies, I fear it may not fully accord. Generally, in the study of righteousness and principle (*ŭiri*, 義理), concerning subtle points, one must broaden one's mind and elevate one's perspective. Never preemptively adopt one theory as primary. With an empty mind and calm disposition, leisurely observe the meaning and intent. Within sameness, recognize difference; within difference, perceive sameness. Dividing into two without harming their inseparability, uniting into one while ensuring they do not mix – only then is understanding comprehensive and without bias. Let me further clarify the necessity of this using the words of sages and worthies. In the past, Confucius (孔子) had the theory of 'continuing goodness and completing nature' (繼善成性). Zhouzi (周子) had the theory of the 'Non-ultimate and Great Ultimate' (無極太極). These both, from within the mutual dependence of Principle and *ki*, single out and speak solely of Principle. Confucius spoke of natures being 'mutually near and mutually distant' (相近相遠). Mencius spoke of the 'nature of ears, eyes, mouth, and nose' (耳目口鼻之性). These both, from within the mutual completion of Principle and *ki*, refer inclusively but primarily speak of *ki*. Are these four examples not recognizing difference within sameness? Zisi's discussion of the Mean and Harmony (中和) speaks of Joy, Anger, Sorrow, and Pleasure (喜怒哀樂) without mentioning the Four Beginnings. Chengzi's discussion of loving learning speaks of Joy, Anger, Sorrow, Fear, Love, Hate, and Desire (喜怒哀懼愛惡欲) and also does not mention the Four Beginnings. These, then, speak broadly from within the mutual dependence of Principle and *ki*. Are these two examples not perceiving sameness within difference? <38>

**Summary**

This article from the 1921 issue of *Gaebyeok* introduces the Neo-Confucian philosophy of the renowned Joseon scholar T'oegye Yi Hwang (1501-1570). It presents excerpts from two of his major works: the *Sin myŏngdo sol* (New Diagram and Explanation of the Heavenly Mandate) and the *Sadan ch'ilchŏng non* (Discourse on the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings), specifically his second letter to Ki Kobong. The text delves into T'oegye's cosmology, explaining the relationship between Principle (*li*) and Material Force (*ki*), the Heavenly Mandate, the Four Virtues, the Five Agents, and the Five Constants. It further explores his anthropology and ethics, differentiating between humans and other creatures based on the purity of their *ki*, analyzing the structure of the human mind, and famously distinguishing between the Four Beginnings (issuing from *li*, purely good) and the Seven Feelings (issuing from *ki*, susceptible to evil). The importance of moral cultivation through Reverence (*kyŏng*) is emphasized. For historians, the article highlights the continued engagement with and re-evaluation of traditional Korean Neo-Confucian thought by intellectuals during the Japanese colonial period. Publishing T'oegye's sophisticated philosophical arguments in a prominent journal like *Gaebyeok* could represent an assertion of Korean intellectual heritage and cultural identity in the face of colonial pressures and the influx of modern Western and Japanese ideologies.

問天命之義. 可得聞歟. 曰天. 卽理也. 而其德有四. 曰元亨利貞是也. 四者之實曰誠. 蓋元者. 始之理. 亨者. 通之理. 利者. 遂之理. 貞者. 成之理. 而其所以循環不息者. 莫非眞實無妄之妙. 乃所謂誠也. 故當二五流行之際. 此四者常寓於其中. 而爲命物之源. 是以凡物受陰陽五行之氣. 以爲形者. 莫不具元亨利貞之理. 以爲性. 其性之目有五. 曰仁義禮智信. 故四德五常. 上下一理. 未嘗有間於天人之分. 然其所以有聖愚人物之異者. 氣爲之也. 非元亨利貞之本然. 故子思直曰天命之謂性. 蓋二五妙合之源. 而指四德言指子也. 理本一也其德至於四者何也曰理太極也太極中本無物事初豈有四德之可名乎但以流行後觀之則必有其始有始則必有其通有通則必有其遂有遂則必有其成故其始而通通而遂遂而成而四德之名立焉是以合以言之則一理而已分而言之則有此四箇理故天以一理命萬物而萬物之各有一理者此也.

右第一節 論天命之理
問天旣有四德. 而命萬物. 則所謂五行者. 亦何道歟. 曰天地之間. 有理有氣. 纔有理. 便有氣眹焉. 纔有氣. 便有理從焉. 理爲氣之師. 氣爲理之卒. 以遂天地之功. 所謂理者. 四德是也. 所謂氣者. 五行是也. 而其於流行之際. 元爲始物之理. 則木之氣承之以生. 亨爲通物之理. 則火之氣承之以長. 利爲遂物之理. 則金之氣承之以收. 貞爲成物之理. 則水之氣承之以藏. 士則俱旺四季 此天之所以具四德五行. 而成其道者也.

右第二節 論五行之氣＜34＞

問天以四德五行而成其道者. 固也. 然於圖以四德五行. 同位合書. 而五行則圈書干陰陽之中. 四德則又就其裏爲圈而書之者. 何歟. 曰理外無氣. 氣外無理. 固不可斯須離也. 而其分則亦不可相紊而無其別也. 况陰陽五行. 本非二物. 是以於五行則置陰陽中. 而必含其四德. 以示五行爲一陰陽而各一其性也. 四德則圈書於五行之裏. 以示理終不離乎氣. 而亦不離乎氣也.

右第三節 倫理氣之分
問旣曰元爲始物之理而木之氣承之以生. 則其生物之源. 宣本於木. 而於圖. 必本於水者. 何歟. 曰元固爲始物之理. 木亦爲生物之氣. 而其所以爲元之理. 不出於元而出於貞. 其所以爲木之氣. 不出於木而出於水. 故貞爲成物之理. 而亦有始之之理. 水爲藏物之氣. 而亦有生之之氣. 此水之所以承貞之德. 以爲生物之源者也. 是故凡物之生也. 其形則雖待木之氣而成. 其所以形之之原. 實朕於水之氣矣. 何以知其然也. 蓋物之所以生者. 其初也莫不先稟乎水之氣. 漸以凝聚. 久而後堅固而成形焉. 至於天地之所以生者. 亦莫不先以水氣而成此理. 先儒之論己悉. 玆不復贅. 然則生物之原. 所以本於水者. 何足疑乎.

右第四節 論生物之原
問人物之生也. 其所受之性. 均是天地之理. 所稟之形. 均是天地之氣. 然則人與物. 本無間也. 今於人形. 則心白其全體. 以爲五性傍通. 於禽獸則必於性圈上下. 白其一線之路. 以爲或通一路. 於草木則白其性圈而黑其全體. 以爲全塞不通. 此何義耶. 曰天地之間. 理一而氣萬下齊. 故究其理則合萬物而同一性也. 論其氣則分萬物而各一氣也. 何者. 理之爲理. 其體本虛. 虛故無對. 無對故在人在物. 固無加損而爲一焉. 至於氣也. 則始有陰陽對立之象. 而互爲其根. 故陰中不能無陽. 陽中不能無陰. 陰中陽之中. 又不能無陰. 陽中陰之中. 又不能無陽. 其變至於十百千萬. 而各不能無對焉, 然則凡物之受此理氣者. 其性則無間. 而其氣則不能無偏正之殊矣. 是故人物之生也. 其得陰陽之正氣者. 爲人. 得陰陽之偏氣者. 爲物. 人旣得陰陽之正氣. 則其氣質之通且明. 可知也. 物旣得陰陽之偏氣. 則其氣質之塞且暗. 可知也. 然就人物而觀之. 則人爲正物爲偏. 就禽獸草木而觀之. 則禽獸爲偏中之正. 草木爲偏中之偏. 故禽獸則其氣質之中. 或有一路之通. 草木則只具其理而全塞不通焉. 然則其性之所以或通或塞者. 乃因氣有正偏之殊也. 其形之所以或白或黑者. 乃示氣有明暗之異也. 夫何有他義於其間哉. 人與禽獸草木之形所以有圓方橫逆之不同者何＜35＞耶曰人物之形所以異者亦陰陽二氣之所致也盖陽之性順而平陰之性逆而倒故人爲天地之秀子而爲陽故頭必如天足必如地而平正直立物爲天地之偏塞子而爲陰故形不類人而或橫或逆然禽獸則乃爲陰中之陽故生不全倒而爲橫草木則乃爲陰中之陰故生必逆而爲倒此皆稟氣之不同而氣有順逆之所致也.

右第五節 論人物之殊
問人心所具. 可得而分言之歟. 曰天之降命干人也. 非此氣. 無以寓此理也. 非此心. 無以寓此理氣也. 故吾人之心. 虛理而且靈. 氣爲理氣之舍. 故其理. 卽四德之理. 而爲五常. 其氣. 卽二五之氣. 而爲氣質. 此人心所具. 皆本乎天者也. 然而所謂五常者. 純善而無惡. 故其所發之四端. 亦無有不善. 所謂氣質者. 非本然之性. 故其所發之七情. 易流於邪惡. 然則性情之名雖一. 而性情之用. 則不得不異矣. 至於曰性曰情之所以該具運用者. 莫非此心之妙. 故心爲主宰. 而常統其性情. 此人心之大槪也. 曰然則情在心圈之外. 何耶. 曰五行本當在陰陽之圈. 而濂溪之圖. 出於圈外. 蓋爲圖而別之. 不得已而然爾.

右第六節 論人心之具
問性情之目. 必與四德五行. 相準以列之者. 何耶. 曰人之五性四端. 固與天之四德相應. 而各有攸屬矣. 唯七情之分. 似爲參差. 然以類推之. 亦各有合焉. 若喜愛之於木. 樂之於火. 怒惡之於金. 哀之於水. 欲之配于土而無不在焉. 是也. 此天人之所以爲一體也.

右第七節 論性情之目
問意下有善幾惡幾之分. 何耶. 曰意者. 心之所發. 而心者. 性情之主也. 故當此心未發之前. 如太極具動靜之理. 而未判爲陰陽者也. 一心之內. 渾然一性. 純善而無惡矣. 及此心已發之時. 如太極已判. 而動爲陽靜爲陰者也. 於斯時也. 氣始用事. 故其情之發. 不能無善惡之殊. 而其端甚微. 於是意爲心發. 而又挾其情而左右之. 或循天理之公. 或循人欲之私. 善惡之分. 由玆而決焉. 此所謂意幾善惡者也. 雖然善之發也. 原於固有. 故直遂而順. 惡之萌也. 出於本無. 故旁橫而戾. 此趙致道誠幾圖之所爲作. 而於此取以爲說者也.

右第八節 論意幾善惡
問人物通塞之分. 由氣有正偏之殊者. 旣得聞命矣. 吾人也皆得氣之正者也. 然亦有上智中人下遇三等之殊. 何耶. 曰人之氣正則正矣. 而其氣也有陰有陽. 則其氣質之禀. 亦豈無淸濁粹駁之可言乎. 是以人之生也. 禀氣於天. 而天之氣. 有淸有濁. 禀質於地. 而地之質. 有粹有駁. 故禀得其淸且粹者. 爲上智. 而上智之於天理. 知之旣明. 行之又盡. 自與天合焉. 禀得其淸而駁濁而粹者.＜36＞ 爲中人. 而中人之於天理. 一則知有餘而行不足. 一則知不足而行有餘. 始與天有合有違焉. 禀得其濁且駁者. 爲下愚. 而下愚之於天理. 知之旣暗. 行之又邪. 遠與天違焉. 此人之禀. 大槪有三等者也. 雖然理氣相須. 無乎不在. 則雖上智之心. 不能無形氣之所發. 理之所在. 不以智豊. 不以遇嗇. 則雖在下愚之心. 不得無天理之本然. 故氣質之美. 上智之所不敢自恃者也. 天理之本. 下愚之所當自盡者也. 是故禹大聖人也. 而舜必勉之以惟情惟一. 顔子大賢人也. 而夫子必道之以博文約禮. 至於大學. 學者事也. 而曾子必以格致誠正. 爲知行之訓. 中庸. 敎者事也. 而子思必以擇善固執. 爲知行之道. 然則學問之道. 不係於氣質之美惡. 惟在知天理之明不明. 行天理之盡不盡如何耳.

右第九節 論氣質之禀
問心裏之敬與存養. 及情意之省察與敬. 何謂也. 曰人之受命于天也. 具四德之理. 以爲一身之主宰者. 心也. 事物之感於中也. 隨善惡之幾. 以爲一心之用者. 情意也. 故君子於此心之靜也. 必存養以保其體. 於情意之發也. 必省察以正其用. 然此心之理. 浩浩然不可模捉. 渾渾然不可涯涘. 苟非敬以一之. 安能保其性而立其體哉. 此心之發. 微而爲毫釐之難察. 危而爲抗塹之難蹈. 苟非敬以一之. 又安能正其幾而達其用哉. 是以君子之學. 當此心未發之時. 必主於敬. 而加存養工夫. 當此心已發之際. 亦必主於敬. 而加省察工夫. 此敬學之所以成始成終. 而通貫體用者也. 故圖之切要之意. 尤在於此也.

右第十節 論存省之要

二. 四端七情論
性情之辯. 先儒發明詳矣. 惟四端七情之云. 但俱謂之情而未見有以理氣分說者焉. 往年鄭生之作圖也. 有四端發於理. 七情發於氣之說. 愚意亦恐其分別太甚. 或致爭端故. 改下純善兼氣等語. 蓋欲相資以講明. 非謂其言之無疵也. 今者蒙示辯說. 摘快差謬. 開嘵諪悉. 警益深矣. 然猶有所不能無惑者. 請試言之而取正焉. 夫四端情也. 七情亦情也. 均是情也. 何以有四七之異名耶. 來喩所謂所就以言之者不同是也. 蓋理之與氣. 本相須以爲體. 相待以爲用. 固未有無理之氣. 亦未有無氣之理. 然而所就而言之不同則亦不容無別. 從古聖賢有論及二者. 何嘗必滾合爲一說而不分別言之耶. 且以性之一字言之. 子思所謂天命之性.＜37＞ 孟子所謂性善之性. 此二性字所指而言者何在乎. 將非就理氣賦與之中而指此理源頭本然處言之乎. 由其所指者在理不在氣故. 可謂之純善無惡耳. 若以理氣不相離之故而欲兼氣爲說則. 已不是性之本然矣. 夫以子思孟子. 洞見道體之全而立言如此者. 非知其一不知其二也. 誠以爲雜氣而言性則無以見性之本善故也. 至於後世程張諸子之出然後. 不得已而有氣質之性之論. 亦非求多而立異也. 所指而言者. 在乎禀生之後則. 又不得純以本然之性. 稱之也. 故. 愚嘗妄以爲情之有四端七情之分. 猶性之有本性氣禀之異也. 然則其於性也. 旣可以理氣分言之. 至於情. 獨不可以理氣分言之乎. 惻隱羞惡辭讓是非. 何從而發乎. 發於仁義禮智之性焉爾. 喜怒哀懼愛惡欲. 何從而發乎. 外物觸其形而動於中. 緣境而出焉爾. 四端之發. 孟子旣謂之心則心固理氣之合也. 然而所指而言者則主於理何也. 仁義禮智之性. 粹然在中而四者其端緖也. 七情之發. 程子謂之動於中. 朱子謂之各有攸當則固亦兼理氣也. 然而所指而言者則在乎氣何也. 外物之來. 易感而先勊�者. 莫如形氣而七者其苗脉也. 安有在中爲純理而才發爲雜氣. 外感則形氣而其發顧爲理不爲氣耶. 四端皆善也. 故曰無四者之心. 非人也. 而曰乃若其情則可以爲善矣. 七情本善而易流於惡故. 其發而中節者. 乃謂之和. 一有之而不能察則心已不得其正矣. 由是觀之. 二者. 雖曰皆不外乎理氣而因其所從來. 各指其所主而言之則謂之某爲理. 某爲氣何不可之有乎. 竊詳來喩之意. 深有見於理氣之相循不離而主張其說甚力故. 以爲未有無理之氣. 亦未有無氣之理而謂四端七情非有異義. 此雖近是而揆以聖賢之旨. 恐有所未合也. 大抵義理之學. 精微之致. 必須大著心胸. 高著眼目. 切勿先以一說爲主. 虛心平氣. 徐觀其意趣. 就同中而知其有異. 就異中而見其有同. 分而爲二而不害其未嘗離. 合而爲一而實歸於不相雜. 乃爲周悉而無偏也. 請復以聖賢之說. 明其必然. 昔者孔子有繼善成性之論. 周子有無極太極之說. 此皆就理氣相循之中. 剔撥而獨言理也. 孔子言相近相遠之性. 孟子言耳目口鼻之性. 此皆就理氣相成之中. 兼指而主言氣也. 斯四者. 豈非就同中而知其有異乎. 子思之論中和言喜怒哀樂而不及於四端. 程子之論好學言喜怒哀懼愛惡欲而亦不言四端. 是則就理氣相須之中而運淪言之也. 斯二者豈非就異中而見其有同乎.＜38＞
