▶Apology Notice◀
As we previously announced carefully through various newspapers at the time, this magazine's October issue (No. 16) unfortunately touched upon matters deemed taboo by the authorities and was consequently confiscated. We immediately began preparations for a special issue, but that also did not proceed as intended due to various circumstances, and only now are we finally able to reach your desks. As it was edited amidst much haste, there are many crude aspects in content and form; we ask that you forgive us, understanding the circumstances. Facing this paper evokes many feelings, but I shall not elaborate further.
Kaebyŏk Company, Respectfully <106>

**Summary**

This notice from the Kaebyŏk Publishing Company informs readers that their October 1921 issue (No. 16) was confiscated by "the authorities" for containing sensitive content. They apologize for the delay and potential shortcomings of the replacement issue, which was hastily prepared due to difficulties. For historians, this article is a direct testament to the censorship (`忌諱`, `押收`) imposed by the Japanese colonial authorities (`當局`) on Korean publications, illustrating the precarious environment in which Korean intellectuals and publishers operated and the challenges they faced in disseminating information and ideas.
