慶州五陵懷古
徐居正 遺稿
Sŏbŏl's thousand-year royal aura fades,
Deep within the Five Tombs, I mourn the former dynasty.
The neighing horse, the dragon's birth - tales strange and desolate,
Ch’akp’o and Kyerim share the same solitude.
Jade belts and treasures vanished with the golden chests,
Bronze camel shadows meet swaying stone sheep.
No more "tooth cakes" (齒餠) to pass on the throne's fortune,
Spring trees, year after year, hear the shrike's cry.

魚世謙  遺稿
At sunset, the traveler's spirit longs to dissolve,
A sorrowful wind rises sharply, chilling the frosty morning.
Kings and nobles, though born to rank, now lie in many mounds,
Their souls, with no return, revert to deep silence.
Stone qilin lie desolate, utterly forlorn,
My heart, like waving banners, feels utterly unsteady.
Pitifully, the three clans (三姓) are all dust and earth,
I wish to be like Hongae, transcending these two labors.
<79>

**Summary**

These two posthumously published classical Chinese poems by Joseon dynasty scholars Sŏ Kŏ-jŏng and Ŏ Se-gyŏm express profound melancholy and nostalgia upon visiting the Five Royal Tombs (Orŭng) of the Silla dynasty in Gyeongju. Both poems lament the faded glory of Silla, contrasting its thousand-year history and legendary origins with the present desolation of the tombs and surrounding landscape, reflecting on the impermanence of power and life itself. From a colonial history perspective, the publication of these poems in 1923, evoking sorrow for a lost Korean dynasty, might be seen as a subtle expression of national sentiment and yearning for past sovereignty during a period of Japanese rule. Historians could find interest in this use of historical reflection as a potential vehicle for veiled contemporary commentary.

慶州五陵懷古
徐居正 遺稿
徐伐千年王氣銷, 五陵深處吊前朝, 馬嘶龍誕會荒怪, 鵲浦鷄林共寂寥. 玉帶寶隨金樻盡, 銅駝影接石羊搖. 更無齒餠能傳祚, 春樹年年語伯勞.
