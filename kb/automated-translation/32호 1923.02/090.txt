Company Announcement

The P'yŏngnam branch office of Kaebyŏk has appointed Ms. Chŏng Sŏn-juk (丁善竹 女史) as the P'yŏngnam branch's female reporter in order to introduce news from various aspects of the women's world.

For the convenience of readers in the Pakch'ŏn region, a Kaebyŏk Branch Agency (開闢 分社) has been established. Local individuals, please direct your requests for Kaebyŏk and women's magazines, as well as payment settlements, to the Branch Agency head, Mr. Pyŏn Yŏng-do (邊榮道).

**Summary**

This announcement from Kaebyŏk magazine informs readers of two developments: the appointment of Chŏng Sŏn-juk as a female reporter for the P'yŏngnam branch to cover women's news, and the establishment of a new branch agency in Pakch'ŏn under Pyŏn Yŏng-do to handle magazine requests and payments locally. From a historical perspective, these notices reveal Kaebyŏk's efforts to expand its reach and coverage during the colonial period. The specific appointment of a female reporter highlights a growing awareness of and interest in women's issues and perspectives, while the creation of a local branch demonstrates the magazine's logistical expansion to better serve readers outside the capital.
