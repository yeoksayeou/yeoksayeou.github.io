＜60-61＞ Wave of Reconstruction

**Summary**

This entry refers to a cartoon titled "Wave of Reconstruction" published in the February 1923 issue of the influential Korean magazine *Gaebyeok*. While the cartoon's visual content is not provided, the title suggests a theme common in the 1920s colonial period: the call for societal change, modernization, or national reform amidst challenging political circumstances. Historians might find the cartoon (if available) interesting for its visual depiction of contemporary ideas about "reconstruction" or "reform," potentially reflecting nationalist aspirations, critiques of existing social structures, or commentary on modernization efforts during the Japanese colonial era, all communicated through the accessible medium of a cartoon in a prominent intellectual journal.
