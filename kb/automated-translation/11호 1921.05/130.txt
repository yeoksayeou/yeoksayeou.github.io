Public Notice
						Hwang Sŏgu, Hyŏn Ch'ŏl

As the esteemed readers of *Kaebyŏk* already know, we (the undersigned) have engaged in a debate concerning poetry through this magazine. However, as there are some among the public who, perhaps not knowing the true intention, misunderstand this as an emotional conflict between Hwang and Hyŏn, we hereby respectfully announce that, as a result of shaking hands and consulting with each other, we have decided to retract anything in the sentences and phrases that could be considered emotional statements.

**Summary**

This brief notice is a joint statement by Hwang Sŏgu and Hyŏn Ch'ŏl addressed to the readers of *Kaebyŏk* magazine. They acknowledge their recent published debate on poetry and state that some people have misinterpreted it as a personal, emotional conflict between them. To correct this misunderstanding, they announce they have mutually agreed to retract any emotionally charged language used in their articles. This article is interesting to historians as it reflects how public intellectuals in colonial Korea managed their public image and intellectual disagreements, seeking to maintain civility and correct potential misinterpretations. It highlights the concern for public perception and the desire to keep intellectual debate separate from personal animosity during a sensitive period.
