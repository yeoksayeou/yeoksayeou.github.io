From Beneath Great-Grandmother's Grave
						Kim Sŏksong

Graveyard 1
Graveyard! Graveyard—
That place is the dwelling
of people who have lost Life.

There,
there is no Joy,
there is no Grief,
no Love, no Jealousy...
there is nothing.
In the spring breeze and autumn rain,
crying birds and laughing flowers
are the sole masters of that Emptiness.

However,
Graveyard! The graveyard
is before our house gate.

Graveyard 2
Graveyard— that place
is the secluded village
of the father of Tradition.

He
gifted his beloved child—Tradition—
to the world
and quietly hid himself in the graveyard.

His gift,
like merchandise,
is piled high <113>
on the pier called the World.

Ah! Life!
Your name
is the "Chain of Tradition,"
endlessly long.

Winter Solstice
The tea ceremony is finished.
We received the red bean porridge table,
the whole family together...
Even the seven-year-old
younger sister,
who had been singing the porridge song
from inside the blankets.

But soon,
the young sister
put down her spoon
and sat blankly—

Grandmother saw her and
asked, "Child, why aren't you eating?"

"Because if I eat the whole bowl,
I'll turn one year older..."
the young sister cried out thus.

We all laughed loudly.
And in the end,
there wasn't enough porridge.

Oh! You Who Go Before!
Oh! You who go before!
You are a demon!

When your feet—your two feet stained with red earth—
are placed one by one
upon the great road covered in pure—holy—untrodden—
white snow,
the whole road
becomes covered in blood.

Oh! You who go before!
You are a demon!

However,
even I, who curse you like this,
am one who commits
entirely the same act as you! <114>
<113-114>

**Summary**

This collection of poems by Kim Sŏksong reflects on themes of death, tradition, time, and progress. The graveyard poems contemplate death's emptiness but also its connection to ancestry and tradition, paradoxically located at the threshold of life. "Winter Solstice" captures a child's innocent resistance to aging, symbolized by the traditional porridge marking the passage of a year, contrasting with adult acceptance. The final, untitled poem vehemently denounces the "pioneer" or "one who goes before" as a destructive force that defiles purity, yet ends with the speaker's self-aware admission of similar complicity. For historians of the colonial period, the poems offer insights into contemporary anxieties. The focus on "Tradition" and traditional rites like the Winter Solstice observance, juxtaposed with the child's fear of inevitable change (aging), might reflect unease about cultural continuity under Japanese rule. The harsh condemnation of the "pioneer" figure as a blood-staining "demon" could be interpreted as a metaphor for the violent disruptions of colonialism or forced modernization, while the final lines suggest the complex, perhaps unavoidable, entanglement of individuals within these historical processes.

曾祖母의 墓下에서
						金石松
墓地 1
墓地! 墓地-
그곳은 生命을 일흔
사람들의 住宅이다.

그곳엔
歡樂도 업고
悲痛도 업다
愛情도 嫉妬도...
아모것도 업다
봄바람 가을비에
우는 새 웃는 꼿이
오즉 그 空墟의 主人일다

그러나
墓地! 墓地는
우리집 門前이다.

墓地 2
墓地- 그 곳은
傳統의 아버지의
隱居한 村落이다.

그네는
自己의 愛子-傳統을
세상에 선물하고
가만히 墓地로 숨엇다

그네의 선물은
商品과 가티
世上이란 埠頭에＜113＞
가득히 싸히엇다

아! 人生아!
너의 이름은
「傳統의 連鎖」일다
限업시 길은


冬至
茶禮는 마치엇다
우리는 팟죽상을 바닷다
家族一同이...
입울속에서부터
팟죽 노래를 부르던
일곱 살 먹은 어린
누이동생까지

그러나 未久에
어린 누의동생은
수저를 노코
우두커니 안젓다-

한머니가 보시고
「아가 왜 안먹니?」
하고 무르시엇다

「한 그릇 다 먹으면
한 살 더 먹으니까...」
어린 동생은 이러케 부르지젓다

우리는 모다 크게 웃엇다
그리고 팟죽은
마츰내 不足햇다

오! 압서가는 者여!
오! 압서가는 者여!
너는 惡魔다!

너의 발이 -赤土 무든 두 발이
純白한- 聖潔한 -밟지 아니한-
白雪이 덥힌 大道우에
하나 둘 씩 노힐적에
온 길바닥은
피투성이가 된다

오! 압서가는 者여!
너는 惡魔다!

그러나
이러케 咀呪하는 나도
너와 全等한-
行爲를 하는 者다!＜114＞
＜113-114＞
