**Body Text Translation:**
Grand Call for Prize Submissions

Flowing time passes endlessly, and before long, our [Kaebyŏk] Magazine will soon celebrate its welcome first anniversary since its birth into the world. During this time, that we have, with our meager strength, kept pace together with our nation's literary fortune is something our dear readers likely recognize to some extent, and even when we reflect upon ourselves, we are confident that we have nothing to be ashamed of.

However, we members of the Kaebyŏk Company are certainly not satisfied with this and will not avoid struggle and effort; rather, we pledge ourselves to use the best methods for improvement and progress moment by moment.

Our company, to celebrate both this resolution and the first anniversary, plans to publish an enlarged issue this coming July. At that time, to widely introduce the hidden critics and literary figures of our Peninsula to the world as a major highlight, we intend to solicit submissions for a grand prize contest under the following conditions, so we earnestly hope all our dear readers throughout the land will compete to apply.

Short Piece: Within 50 lines, 23 characters per line (Topic of your choice)

**Summary**

This article announces a major writing contest organized by the magazine *Kaebyŏk* to celebrate its first anniversary. It calls for submissions in four categories: essays (on non-political social issues), short pieces, new poetry, and fiction, detailing line limits, prize amounts (ranging from 3 to 10 Won, or magazine subscriptions), the number of winners per category, and the deadline (June 10th). The announcement expresses pride in the magazine's progress and its aim to discover and introduce "hidden" literary talents from the Korean Peninsula. For historians, this piece is significant as it reflects early efforts to cultivate modern Korean literature and journalism during the colonial period, showcasing the specific genres being promoted and the monetary/recognition incentives offered. The explicit exclusion of political topics in the essay category is particularly revealing of the censorship and constraints under which cultural activities operated.
