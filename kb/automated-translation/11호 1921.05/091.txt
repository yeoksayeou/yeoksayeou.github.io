**Body Text Translation:**
Company Notice

It seems that local distribution centers are not fully aware of the postage for sending this magazine. Our *Kaebyŏk* can be sent and received not only within the Korean mainland (朝鮮 內地) but also to Japan or even China for a postage of one *chŏn* (壹錢) per copy. This is because we have obtained permission for Third-Class Mail (三種郵便物). Therefore, even if a clerk at a local post office is unaware and says something different (말), please explain clearly so they understand that it is Third-Class Mail (第三種郵種).

The postage rates for Third-Class Mail are as follows (如左):
Periodicals published at least once a month (每月 一回 以上 刊行의 定期刊行物)
Weight: Five *rin* (金五厘) per 20 *momme* (二十匁) or fraction thereof.
Japan-China Mail (日支郵便): Five *rin* (金五厘) per 13 *momme* (十三匁).
(Note) Periodicals classified as Third-Class Mail are limited to those approved by the competent authority (主務官署) (First-Class Post Office - 一等 郵便局).

If you affix postage stamps according to this weight, there will be no mistake. <65>

**Summary**

This notice from the magazine *Kaebyŏk* instructs its local distributors on the correct, cheaper postage rate applicable to the magazine. It clarifies that *Kaebyŏk* has secured Third-Class Mail status, allowing it to be mailed within Korea and to Japan and China for a low price (one *chŏn*). The notice details the specific weight-based rates and advises distributors on how to inform postal clerks who might be unaware of this classification. For historians, this article provides insight into the practical challenges of publishing and distributing a Korean magazine during the colonial period, specifically highlighting the interaction with the Japanese-controlled postal system and the economic considerations involved in utilizing specific mail classifications like the Third-Class Mail system, which required official approval.
