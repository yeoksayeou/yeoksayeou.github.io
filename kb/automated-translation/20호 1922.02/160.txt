Seeing the Scenery of Nanjing, Capital of the Ming Dynasty

Nanjing City Walls
Dragon coiled, tiger crouching marks Nanjing;
The prosperity of the Six Dynasties remains unchanged.
Carriages and horses are like clouds, commerce thrives;
There is no one who does not think of this ancient city.

Wuchao Gate
Lofty golden palaces reach the ninth heaven;
Remembering past years when court officials stood straight like cranes.
Now, grains sadly fill the view;
Along the palace gate road, starving children [or children among weeds] sleep.

Nanjing Commercial Port
Having arrived here, how can one not inquire?
Coming and going, carriages and horses chase the flying dust.
Ten thousand businesses in the port gather like clouds;
The scenery vaguely resembles the Shanghai Bund (滬濱).

Ming Tombs
Unable to bear the neglect, the historic site was heavily restored;
The previous dynasty's tombs are brilliantly renewed.
Men in red and women in green vie to gaze upon them;
Though damaged, stone horses and men still remain.

Respectfully Mourning Teacher Un'yang, Kim Yun-sik
By Mukchae Ch'oe Sŏng'u

Days of experiencing hardships,
Calmly, the heart maintained itself.
The stone spring flows without end, On the day the teacher passed away, he said, 'Forever leaving the human world's medicine, I will long drink from the Sŏkbo Spring (石寶泉).'
Surely, one sees the hibiscus (槿花) grow.
Right: Public Mourning

The day all the students gathered like clouds,
The literary banquet was held again.
White hair under the pear blossom moon,
Kindly offering a cup.
On the day the republication of the Un'yang Collection (雲養集) was completed, Chamhyŏn (蠶賢) hosted a celebratory banquet at the teacher's flower garden. Presenting poems and praises, feeling unworthy, I was also fortunate enough to be seated at the end and excessively received the teacher's favor, personally receiving a cup. At that time, it was late spring, white hair and pear blossoms blended with the moon reflecting, hence this mention.
Right: Private Mourning<86>

**Summary**

This article presents two sets of Hansi (Chinese-style poems). The first set, by Kisŏk, describes observations of Nanjing, China, reflecting on its historical significance as the Ming capital, its current bustling commerce compared to Shanghai, the decaying grandeur of its palace gates, and the restored Ming Tombs. The second set, by Mukchae Ch'oe Sŏng'u, consists of two elegies for Kim Yun-sik (Un'yang), a prominent late Chosŏn/early colonial era figure. The poems praise Kim's resilience and character, referencing his last words and subtly invoking national sentiment with the mention of the hibiscus flower, and fondly recall a personal memory of a banquet celebrating the republication of Kim's works. For historians, the poems offer insights into Korean intellectual perspectives during the 1920s. Kisŏk's focus on China might indicate a reflection on shared cultural heritage or a comparative lens on Korea's own situation under colonialism. Ch'oe's elegies for Kim Yun-sik, a complex historical figure, reveal how such individuals were remembered and venerated within intellectual circles, while the personal anecdote paints a picture of their cultural life and social networks.

明室의 都邑이던 南京景致를 보고

南京城壁
龍蟠虎踞屬南京
六代繁華未變更
車馬如雲商務盛
無人不念此古城

午朝門
峨峨金闕九重天
鵠立朝臣憶昔年
禾黍而今傷滿目
宮門一路莩兒眠

南京商埠
到此如何不問津
往來車馬逐飛塵
萬家商埠同雲集
風景依稀似滬濱

明陵
古跡重修不忍酒
先朝陵寢煥然新
紅男綠女爭瞻仰
殘缺猶有石馬人

謹輓 雲養 金允稙先生
黙齋 崔誠愚

閱歷崎嶇日,
澹然心自持.
石泉流不盡, 先生易簀之日有 『永辭人間藥長飮石寶泉』
應見槿花滋.
右公哭

諸生雲集日,
文讌見重開.
白首梨花月.
慇懃勸一杯.
雲養集重刊畢卽日蠶賢設賀宴于先生之花院以詩獻頌不安亦得忝席末而濫被先生之寵親授一杯時卽暮春皓首梨花迷月相映故及此
右私哭＜86＞
