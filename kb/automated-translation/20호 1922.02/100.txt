The Teacher's Tragic and Passionate Life

The Teacher's surname was Ch'oe, his given name was Che-u (first name Che-sŏn), and his sobriquet (ho) was Suunje. He was born 98 years ago from now, in the Kapsin year (the 24th year of King Sunjo of the Yi Dynasty, and the 4th year of the Daoguang Emperor of the Ch'ing Dynasty), on October 28th, in Kajŏng-ri, Kyŏngju, Chosŏn.

The Teacher's father's name was Ok; he was renowned throughout the province for his writing and morality. According to tradition, one day his wife, Ms. Han—suddenly fainted and lost consciousness, at which time two radiances—entered her bosom and a strange energy—possessed her body, eventually leading to her conceiving the Teacher.

After the Teacher suffered the loss of his father at age 16, the family fortune declined, and studying books also brought no satisfaction. Sometimes—he entrusted his path to archery and horsemanship, sometimes—he engaged in trade to vent his melancholic and passionate feelings. He once took interest in Sŏn (Zen) Buddhism and the divination arts of the Book of Changes, but did not pursue them either, often lamenting to himself, saying:
"Since recent times, the people of this generation each act according to their own minds, not following heavenly principles, nor regarding the mandate of Heaven, so the world is—in turmoil and the people's hearts are thin. My heart is always fearful, not knowing which way to turn. Alas! This age cannot be adequately discussed even with the virtues of Confucius and Mencius; it cannot be adequately spoken of even with the governance of Yao and Shun. Surely, harm—will be great, and destiny will undergo a great revolution." With this, he sought to escape the turmoil of the world, remove the knots in his heart, traveled widely in all directions, visiting great mountains and deep valleys, staying temporarily in hidden hermitages and great temples, consoling his spirit by meditating deeply on the subtle wonders of heaven, earth, and nature, and the true essence of the universe and human life. <63>

According to tradition, "When the Teacher was 32, in the second month of the Ŭlmyo year, while resting peacefully in his thatched cottage, a strange person paid respects to the Teacher and said, 'I reside at Yujŏm Temple on Kŭmgangsan, and having completed a hundred days of prayer, I happened to doze off beneath the pagoda. When I awoke, a strange book was on the pagoda. Upon seeing it, its script and meaning were things first seen in the mundane world and beyond the comprehension of ordinary wisdom. Therefore, seeking someone who could interpret this book, I have trodden nearly all lands. Seeing you, sir, I first realize this book has a recipient. I request that you, sir, grasp its truth spiritually and do not betray this heavenly gift.' The Teacher received it and looked at it; it was a strange book, unseen among the various schools of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism, unparalleled in the past or present. He said to the strange person, 'Leave it here for now.' The strange person said, 'I—shall surely return in three days; sir, please grasp its meaning.' The strange person indeed came on the appointed day, and the Teacher said, 'I have grasped the meaning.' The strange person bowed in thanks, saying, 'Sir, you are truly a heavenly person,' then descended the stairs and suddenly disappeared. The Teacher then realized for the first time that he was an illusory manifestation of a divine spirit. The general significance of this book's meaning was the principle of Innaech'ŏn (Man is Heaven), and within the book, there was the meaning of praying to Heaven for 49 days. Based on the book's intent, he decided on the meaning of the prayer."

The following year, in the summer of the Pyŏngjin year, the Teacher, along with a Buddhist monk, entered Naewŏn Hermitage on Ch'ŏnsŏngsan in Yangsan and began prayers. However, due to the passing of his paternal uncle, he stopped the work after 47 days. In the autumn of the Chŏngsa year, he resumed the act of praying to Heaven. He set up an iron shop externally while internally preparing the tools for praying to Heaven, completing the 49 days of prayer amidst difficulties and pressures.

In the 10th month of the Kimi year, the Teacher moved from Ulsan back to Yongdam in Kyŏngju. From this time, the Teacher vowed not to step outside his gate, changed his first name from Che-sŏn to Che-u, and hung a couplet from an Ipch'un poem on his doorframe: "The spirit of the Way endures forever, evil cannot enter; The multitude of the world do not follow the same path." He wandered among springs and rocks and sat silently indoors, cultivating himself entirely through deep thought and meditation.

It was April 5th of the Kyŏngsin year, when he turned 37. The Teacher, as usual, bathed, purified himself, and sat quietly in his thatched cottage. Suddenly, his mind and body shivered with cold, unable to diagnose the illness, and words were difficult to form. At that moment, immortal words—suddenly entered his ears. Externally, there was the energy of spiritual contact—and internally, there was the teaching of descending words—but though he looked, he could not see, and though he listened, he could not hear. The Teacher rose in surprise and inquired, whereupon a voice said, "Do not fear, do not be afraid. Worldly people call me Sangje (Supreme Ruler); do you—not know Sangje?" When the Teacher asked the reason for this, it said, "Fifty thousand years after the beginning of the world (開闢), you are also the first. For fifty thousand years after the beginning, I—also had no achievement. Now, I have caused you to be born into the world to teach this Law to all humans, so doubt not, doubt not." The Teacher asked, "Then, shall I teach people with the Western Way (Sŏdo - Catholicism)?"

"Said, 'No. My mind is precisely your mind. How could people know this? Heaven and Earth know, but ghosts and spirits did not know; what is called ghosts and spirits <64> is me. I bestow upon you the endlessly infinite Way. Cultivate and refine it, compose its writings to teach people, and establish its laws to spread virtue, then you—will also live long and shine brightly upon the world.'

Also said, 'The fortune of the current age is grievous. Human desires flood the heavens, and morality is swept from the earth, so the constant ethical relationships are already broken. The way of so-called father-father, son-son, ruler-ruler, minister-minister, husband-husband, wife-wife deviates from what I have ordained. Officials who govern and shepherd abuse the people and misgovern, causing much harm. You—teach and transform them to follow my great virtue.'

Also said, 'You—were also just a person; what could you have known? The great destiny cycles, and the billions of the world—will soon return together as one body. You—rectify your mind and cultivate the Way, gradually cultivating and refining, then infinite creation—will all be cast aside, and you will spread virtue throughout the world. The sequential way and law reside herein.' "

The Teacher thereupon guarded his mind and rectified his spirit, thoroughly perceiving the entirety of the Heavenly Way. After undergoing another year of cultivation, there was also the principle of nature—not absent. Through this, he became convinced that he could assist the nation, pacify the people, and furthermore, save all the living beings of the world and all existence in the universe. Finally, he established simple doctrines and showed the disciples the procedure for cultivation. This was the very beginning of the emergence of Chosŏn's Tonghak (Eastern Learning), and today's Ch'ŏndogyo, Sich'ŏn'gyo, and 2 or 3 other religious groups are the successors of this Tonghak.

In the Sinyu year, two years after the Teacher's Great Awakening, many wise gentlemen from all directions—heard of his reputation and came, resulting in frequent dialogues—with the Teacher. Here are a few excerpts from those dialogues:

"Someone asked, 'It is said that the Heavenly Spirit has now descended upon the Teacher; what is the reason?' He replied, 'It is receiving the principle that nothing goes without returning.' 'Then what Way should it be named?' He replied, 'The Heavenly Way (Ch'ŏndo).' 'Is it no different from the Western Way (Sŏdo)?' He replied, 'The destiny (運) is one, and the Way (道) is the same, but the principle (理) is not.' 'What is the reason?' He replied, 'My Way is effortless transformation (無爲而化). If one guards their mind, rectifies their energy, follows their nature, and receives its teachings, transformation—emerges naturally from within.' 'If the Way is the same, should it be called Western Learning (Sŏhak)?' He replied, 'No. I—was born in the East and learned in the East; although the Way—is the Heavenly Way, if called Learning, it should be called Eastern Learning (Tonghak). How can the West be called East, and how can the East be called West?' "

Of course, the meaning of the dialogues at that time was not limited to this, but even from this, one can glimpse—a part of Tonghak. At this time, the Teacher drafted the Yongdam Sa (Songs of Yongdam) and Kyohun Sa (Songs of Instruction) to show his disciples. Subsequently, when establishing the rules for cultivating the Way, he instructed them to offer clear water, contemplate the Heavenly Lord (天主), recite the incantations (呪文), report before sleeping and eating, report before going out and coming in, and take non-악 (evil), non-탐 (greed), non-음 (licentiousness) as their mental precepts (心箴).

In the 6th month of Sinyu, the Teacher headed towards Honam (Southwestern Korea) to observe the mountains, rivers, local customs, and popular sentiment. Arriving at Ŭnjŏk Hermitage in Namwŏn, he further refined his nature and cultivated his mind, drafting the Tosu Sa (Songs of Cultivating the Way) and Kwŏnhak Sa (Songs Encouraging Learning) to send <65> to his disciples.

As the Teacher's learning of the Way deepened daily and his disciples increased monthly, the world's pointing fingers intensified. With the assertions of Confucian scholars, some called him a rebel disrupting Confucian norms (斯文의 亂賊), while others claimed Tonghak was just a different name for the same tune as Western Learning (西學). As the government of the time sought to pressure the Teacher with the sword, on August 14th of the Kyehae year, four years after his Great Awakening, the Teacher wrote the four characters 'Sushim Chŏnggi' (守心正氣 - Guard the Mind, Rectify the Spirit), gave this to his high disciple Ch'oe Hae-wŏl (name Si-hyŏng, the second patriarch of Tonghak), entrusted all matters of the Way entirely to him, and with an even more focused mind, transmitted the Way and lectured on its principles, seemingly implicitly anticipating the coming fate (The books Hŭngbi Ka, Purŏn Kirŏn Ka, Chŏn P'alchŏl, Hu P'alchŏl, T'ando Yushimgŭp, etc., were completed during this period).

In the 12th month of this year, as the Teacher was traveling through various regions, someone urgently informed him, saying, "Recently, the Teacher has been labeled as practicing Western Learning, and the royal court intends to arrest you; Teacher, please take care of yourself." The Teacher laughed and said, "The Way—came forth from me; I—shall naturally face it. Why should I flee and cause trouble to reach you gentlemen?" and was not the least bit perturbed. On the 10th day of this month, the Teacher instructed Ch'oe Hae-wŏl and about 10 other disciples, saying, "Tonight, I—have special business, so you all should return to your respective homes," and alone, lit candles through the night as if waiting for someone appointed. At dawn that day, indeed, Royal Messenger Chŏng Kwi-ryong arrested the Teacher under royal orders.

At this time, the Teacher, under arrest, headed towards the capital with Chŏng Kwi-ryong. When the party reached Kwach'ŏn and stayed for several days, one day the Teacher faced the northern sky and wept bitterly. When the party asked his reason, the Teacher merely said, "You will know soon enough." The next morning, the Royal Messenger conveyed the royal decree: "His Majesty (King Ch'ŏlchong) has passed away; return the Tonghak Teacher Ch'oe Che-u to Taegu Garrison for interrogation and report."

On January 6th of the Kapcha year, the Teacher arrived in Taegu. The provincial governor at the time, Sŏ Hŏn-sun, interrogated him, saying, "You—gather followers and disturb public morals; what do you intend to do next?" The Teacher looked up at Sŏ and said, "I—intend to spread the Way of Infinite Greatness (旡極大道) throughout the world. The emergence of this Way is ordained by Heaven, and furthermore, for my own body to be martyred for the Way and spread its virtue for the next 50,000 years is also ordained by Heaven. You, sir, just do as you will," and said nothing further.

The Teacher underwent 22 rounds of extremely cruel torture but his expression did not change. During the interrogation under flogging, a thunderous sound arose beneath the cane, shaking the building. Those left and right lost their color, and Sŏ Hŏn-sun was also startled, asking the executioner, who replied, "It is the sound of the criminal's shinbone breaking." Thereupon, he ordered him jailed. At the time the Teacher received the punishment, his flesh was greatly injured, leaving no hope of full recovery, but upon reaching the prison, there were generally no wounds, almost like a whole person. The prison guards were all astonished <66> by his divine strangeness, it is said.

While in prison, the Teacher secretly met with his high disciple Ch'oe Hae-wŏl, wrote a couplet "燈明水上無嫌隙 柱似枯形力有餘" (The lamp bright on the water has no gaps; The pillar seems withered but its strength remains) and the four characters "高飛遠走" (Fly high, run far), made a paper note (心紙), inserted it into a tobacco pipe stem, gave it to the high disciple Hae-wŏl, and earnestly entrusted the future of the Great Way to him.

On March 10th, when the Teacher received his sentence under the so-called "Law Against Heretical Ways Disturbing Righteousness" (左道亂正律) at the Taegu Garrison, the sword was brought down repeatedly, but not the slightest mark was left. The governor and everyone around were all astonished, not knowing what to do. The Teacher calmly said to the executioner, "You—bring a bowl of clear water before me." When the executioner brought the clear water, the Teacher faced the clear water, silently contemplated for a good while, then said again, "Take the clear water away," and immediately submitted to the execution. (Offering clear water and silent contemplation was one of the Tonghak rituals established by the Teacher.)

At this time, disciples Kim Kyŏng-p'il, Kim Kyŏng-suk, Chŏng Yong-sŏ, Kwak Tŏk-wŏn, Im Ik-sŏ, Chŏn Tŏk-wŏn, etc., collected the Teacher's body and reached Sŏhuyŏn Inn in Chain-hyŏn. The body was still warm, and where the head and body joined, there was a red and white line. The disciples "guarded the body for three days. In the morning, a rainbow arose from the pond, and auspicious clouds surrounded the house. Then the rainbow disappeared, the clouds rolled away, and bodily fluids began to emerge from the corpse. Thereupon, he was buried at the front foot of Yongdam below Kumi Mountain. The Teacher was 41 years old at the time.

The Teacher's Rise and its Environment

The Kyŏngsin year when the Teacher achieved Great Awakening to the truth of Innaech'ŏn (Man is Heaven) corresponds to 1860 AD. At that time, the world of the East was truly undergoing extreme upheaval. Prior to this, Britain had started the Opium War in 1839, and through the conclusion of the so-called "Treaty of Nanking," besides taking Hong Kong from the Ch'ing nation, collected 21 million dollars in reparations. Later, in 1856, Britain and France again combined their forces, occupied Tientsin, pressed upon Peking, concluded the so-called "Convention of Peking," and carved off land and reparations from the Ch'ing nation. The great lands of East and West suddenly stood under the intimidating pressure of Westerners. As for Chosŏn, in the 31st year of King Sunjo, Sinyu (1831), an English warship appeared at Kodae Island in Hongju County, causing astonishment among high and low officials. In the 11th year of King Honjong, Ŭlsa (1845), the English persistently requested trade, and in the 12th year, Pyŏngo, a French warship came to Oeyŏn Island in Hongju County and displayed its might. Catholicism, called Ch'ŏnjuhak at the time, which had shown signs of flourishing since the reign of King Chŏngjo, entered the reign of King Honjong, and along with the frequent coming and going of Westerners, its influence grew—stronger. Despite strict prohibitions from the royal court, they established their churches and practiced their way, creating concern that the hearts of the entire nation's people might soon lean in that direction. Meanwhile, <67> recalling the internal situation of Chosŏn at that time, due to the poison of factional strife spanning over a hundred years, politics and education had collapsed. Entering King Sunjo's reign, extreme weakness was reached. After the failure of the revolution by Hong Kyŏng-nae of Yonggang (11th year of King Sunjo, Sinmi), the tyranny (reaction to the revolution) of local corrupt officials backed by government power became even more severe, and the hardships of the common people reached an extreme.

To summarize the above, during the period from King Sunjo's reign to King Ch'ŏlchong's reign, Chosŏn internally reached the extreme of political and educational decay, while externally, the appearance of Westerners became frequent, causing the hearts of the court and the populace to be confused, not knowing which way to turn. In other words, internal dangers and external threats arrived simultaneously.

Amidst this, the Teacher, since the age of 16 (5th year of King Honjong, Kihae), felt distressed about the ways of the world and the hearts of the people at the time, saying, "This age cannot be adequately discussed even with the virtues of Confucius and Mencius; it cannot be adequately spoken of even with the governance of Yao and Shun." He burned all the Confucian texts his late father had studied throughout his life in one morning. Sometimes in archery and horsemanship, or trade, sometimes in high mountains and long valleys, he afflicted his mind and body, labored his muscles and bones, feeling melancholic and unhappy. Meanwhile, the storm clouds in the East gathered daily. China, which shared a relationship of lips and teeth with Chosŏn, was about to fall under the trampling of Westerners, and its remaining force suddenly infiltrated Chosŏn, shaking both high and low. Among these, the spread of Catholicism had the potential to conquer the spirit of the Chosŏn people of the time in one fell swoop. The Teacher thought, "At this time, when the domestic politics and education—are so decayed, and the external situation—has changed so much, if we have no countermeasures, what will become of the future of Chosŏn—no, the future of the East? What will become of the ways of the world?" Thereupon, he vowed not to leave his gate, and with single-minded determination, agonized over reversing the great trend. Then, in April of Kyŏngsin, he finally realized the truth that "every thing is Heaven, every affair is Heaven" (物物天 事事天). Carrying the great ideal of "returning together as one body" (同歸一軆), he aimed to fundamentally correct the errors of Westerners who made conquest and plunder their sole view of life, and to revive in one stroke the lethargy of Easterners who had made falsehood and indolence their second nature, thereby spreading virtue throughout the world and, at the same time, broadly saving the masses of the world.

This is not the reporter's speculation, but such sentiments are clearly stated throughout the various writings penned by the Teacher himself. A passage in his "P'odŏk Mun" (布德文 - Proclamation of Virtue) says, "Since recent times, the people of this generation each act according to their own minds, not following the mandate of Heaven, not regarding heavenly principles. The heart is always fearful, not knowing where to turn," lamenting the decay of the domestic people's hearts. Furthermore, speaking of "The West conquers and takes, succeeding in all things, and if the world is destroyed, will there not also be the lament of the lips being gone (if the lips are gone, the teeth are cold)? What plan is there to protect the nation and pacify the people (輔國安民)? Alas, the people of today do not know the timeliness of fate...," he discussed how pressing the external threat approaching politically and materially was. In the "Nonhang Mun" (論學文 - Discourse on Learning), he took another step forward, saying, "The people of the West achieve the Way and establish virtue, and through their creations, nothing is impossible. In attacking and fighting with weapons, no one stands before them. China is annihilated. <68> How can there not be the worry of the lips being gone? It is all for no other reason than that these people's Way is called the Western Way (西道), their learning is called Heavenly Lordism (天主學 - Catholicism), and their religion is called the Holy Religion (聖敎). Is this not knowing the time of Heaven and receiving the mandate of Heaven? Listing these one by one is endless, thus I too am fearful, only lamenting being born late..." etc., pointing out that the power of Westerners lies in the soundness of their national spirit, their banner is reverence for Heaven and love for humanity (today, one would say justice and humanitarianism), so their power—should not be underestimated, and one cannot confront it merely with political power alone. He also stated, "My Way is effortless transformation (無爲而化矣). Guard its mind, rectify its energy, follow its nature, receive its teaching, and transformation emerges from within nature," thereby expressing a distinction from the Western civilization and education which were emblematic, divisive, and possessive.

The Essence of the Teacher's Thought

"Serving the Heavenly Lord (侍天主), creation is determined (造化定), eternally unforgettable (永世不忘), knowing all things (萬事知)"—The true essence of the Teacher's thought is entirely encompassed in these 13 characters above. Among the 13 characters, the three characters 'Sich'ŏnju' (侍天主 - Serving the Heavenly Lord) possess the deepest meaning. The Teacher, in lyrics he composed himself, said, "If the 13 characters are perfected, what use are ten thousand volumes of poetry and books?" And seeing how the Teacher's high disciple, Ch'oe Hae-wŏl, would always ask his disciples if they understood the meaning of 'Sich'ŏnju', one can understand how essential those 13 characters—and especially the 3 characters 'Sich'ŏnju'—are.

So, what does the Teacher's so-called 'Sich'ŏnju' mean?

According to the Teacher's explanation, the people of that time had completely lost the proper conception of 'Heaven' (天) in the term 'Heavenly Lord' (天主). That is, when they said 'Heaven,' they excluded themselves, excluded the myriad things of heaven and earth, excluded wind, rain, frost, and snow, and thought of some separate ruler or god transcending above them. Thus, the people of the world considered the changes of the four seasons and the descent of rain and dew as blessings bestowed by the Heavenly Lord, and perceived the multitude of beings between heaven and earth as a kind of separate creation made by the Heavenly Lord. Consequently, they did not recognize any connection between the existing things in the world, and therefore, felt no spiritual connection whatsoever to natural phenomena like the movement of the sun and moon or the falling of rain and dew. At that time! The people of the generation each acted according to their own minds, not following heavenly principles, not regarding the mandate of Heaven, mutually invading and abusing, slandering and framing, fabricating unnatural hierarchies and false words and deeds, thus creating a degenerate, crude, and violent world.

However, the actual Heavenly Lord is not such a separate entity transcending the myriad things of the universe. Speaking from the perspective of nature, the alternation of spring and autumn and the flourishing and decline of the four seasons are all traces of the Heavenly Lord. Speaking from the perspective of human affairs, every movement, every stillness, every rise, every fall are also traces of the Heavenly Lord. And from the great celestial bodies above to the birds, beasts, and insects below, which <69> is not a manifestation of the Heavenly Lord? Therefore, among us humans, there is no one who does not 'serve' (侍) the Heavenly Lord. At the same time as each of us individually embodies the Heavenly Lord whom we serve, we humans will come to embody the Heavenly Lord served by all existence, that is, the Heavenly Lord as a whole. Only when we embody the Heavenly Lord as a whole will the billions of humans return together as one body, and when the billions of humans return together as one body, the life of the universe will be completely saved.

Since the general thought is like this, the result naturally leads to these interpretations:
1. Under the Teacher's thought, all distinctions cannot be recognized. That is, conventionally, Heaven and man were distinguished, man and things were distinguished, and man and man were distinguished, prohibiting direct interaction between them, sometimes yearning, sometimes viewing with hostility, sometimes abusing, and calling this acceptable. However, in the Teacher's thought, which recognized the myriad things of this universe as manifestations of Heaven, such distinctions are not recognized. Only through mutual assistance and empathy will life be magnified. What the Teacher called "returning together as one body" (同歸一軆) is precisely this.
2. Recognizing the infinity of universal evolution, one simultaneously recognizes the infinity of human self-evolution. That is, conventionally, Heaven and man were viewed separately: Heaven as an entity of already established authority, and man as a kind of spiritual being related to Heaven's creation. While acknowledging human spiritual superiority, there was a view that inherently limited the human path. However, the Teacher viewed Heaven and things as purely one body, and at the same time, stated that this is still an incomplete entity on the path of infinite evolution. Saying "Way of Infinite Greatness" (無極大道) and "Endlessly infinite, knowing all things" (無窮無窮 萬事知) refers precisely to this.
3. All improvement and all solutions are sought from within the self. The result of seeing Heaven and things as purely one body naturally leads to handling all problems starting from the self, because there is nowhere else to search beyond the self. Saying "Not knowing where the brightness resides, seek not far but cultivate myself; Not knowing where virtue resides, gauge the transformation of my own body; Not knowing where destiny resides, observe the brightness of my own mind; Not knowing where the Way resides, measure the oneness of my faith" speaks of this aspect.

There is no limit if one wishes to elaborate on the Teacher's thought. However, since this has been published multiple times in this magazine under the title "Research on Innaech'ŏn," I will omit further details to avoid redundancy.

The Teacher's Appearance and its Ripples

What kind of influence the Teacher's appearance in modern or contemporary Chosŏn, no, the East, <70> indeed had, and is still having, is well known by the general public without needing our lengthy explanation. That the Teacher, in Chosŏn over 60 years ago, amidst the deepest slumber of the time, early on worried about the future of Chosŏn—no, the future of the world, uniquely doubted, agonized, and achieved great enlightenment, grasped the truth of Innaech'ŏn (Man is Heaven) and Mulmulch'ŏn (Things are Heaven), raised the great banner of Puguk Anmin (Assist the Nation, Pacify the People), P'odŏk Ch'ŏnha (Spread Virtue Throughout the World), Kwangje Ch'angsaeng (Broadly Save the Masses), and then, when the time—was wrong and affairs—went awry, threw his life away one morning at the Taegu execution ground, seeking, as it were, the final victory of truth in eternity—this leaves us at a loss for words.

After the Teacher departed, his thought and principles spread daily throughout the world, reaching the point today where those who follow the Teacher's principles alone number approximately 400,000 (since the Tonghak Rebellion). Those who believe in the Teacher as the Great Divine Teacher number unknowably many millions. Not only this, but the Teacher's thought, under the name of the Innaech'ŏn principle, seeks to permeate the spirits of all humankind today, let alone Chosŏn.

To put it in one word, the Teacher is the sun of modern Chosŏn and the torch of the opening of human culture. <71>

**Summary**

This 1922 article from the magazine *Kaebyŏk* presents Ch'oe Che-u (Suun), the founder of Tonghak, as a pivotal figure in Korean history. It details his life, from his birth and early spiritual seeking amidst personal hardship and national decline, to his enlightenment experience in 1860 where he received the core teaching of 'Innaech'ŏn' (Man is Heaven) and 'Sich'ŏnju' (Serving the Heavenly Lord). The article emphasizes the context of Chosŏn's internal decay (corruption, factionalism) and external threats (Western encroachment, the spread of Catholicism or 'Sŏhak'). Ch'oe's Tonghak ('Eastern Learning') is portrayed as a response, aiming to revitalize the nation and counter Western influence through a unique spiritual path emphasizing inner cultivation, universal oneness, and social reform (Puguk Anmin - Protect the Nation, Pacify the People). His arrest, martyrdom under charges of heresy, and the legacy of Tonghak (evolving into Ch'ŏndogyo and other groups) are recounted, positioning him as a spiritual leader whose ideas continued to resonate widely.

For historians of the colonial period, this article is significant as it reflects how nationalist intellectuals and religious figures framed Ch'oe Che-u and Tonghak/Ch'ŏndogyo sixty years after his death. Published in *Kaebyŏk*, a major journal associated with the Ch'ŏndogyo movement and Korean cultural nationalism, it presents Ch'oe not just as a religious founder but as a national savior who diagnosed Korea's crisis and offered an indigenous solution, implicitly contrasting his vision with both traditional Confucianism and Western dominance. The emphasis on Ch'oe's martyrdom and the enduring power of his ideas served to inspire Koreans under Japanese rule.

人乃天 主義의 唱導者 崔濟愚 先生
						一記者
悽絶 慷慨한 先生의 一生
先生의 姓은 崔요 名은 濟愚 (初名은 濟宣)요 號는 水雲齊니 距今 98年 前 甲申(李朝 純祖 24年이오 淸朝 宣宗 道光 4年 이엇다) 10月 28日 朝鮮 慶州 柯亭里에서 誕生하다.
先生의 父의 名은 鋈이니, 文章 道德으로써 一道에 著名하얏다. 傳하는 바에 의하면 一日은 그의 夫人 韓씨- 忽然히 昏倒하야 精神을 莫省할 際에 兩曜- 懷中에 入하고 異氣- 身을 攝하더니 마츰내 先生을 孕하기에 至하얏다 한다.
先生이 16歲에 父喪을 丁한 以後로부터는 家産이 零落하고 書를 學하야 또한 滿足치 아니한지라. 或- 跡을 弓馬에 托하며 或- 事를 販泉에 從하야 그 憂鬱慷慨의 懷를 洩하며 일즉이 意를 禪道와 易數에 留하얏스나 또한 爲치 아니하고 常히 自歎하야 曰
「挽近以來로 一世의 人이 各自 爲心하야 天理를 不順하며 天命을 不顧하야 天下- 紛亂하고 民心이 稀薄하니 心이 恒常 悚然하야 向할 바를 不知하노라. 오호라. 此世는 孔孟의 德으로도 足히 論치 못할지오. 堯舜의 治로도 足히 言치 못할지라. 반듯이 傷害- 多하고 運命이 大革하리라」하며 이에 世間의 紛擾를 擺脫하며 胸海의 繃結을 責去하고 四方에 周遊하야 大山深谷을 歷訪하며 幽庵 巨刹에 奇跡하야 天地自然의 妙趣와 宇宙 人生의 眞諦를 冥想함으로써 其志를 自慰하얏다. ＜63＞
傳에 依하면 「先生이 32歲 되든 乙卯 2월에 從容히 草堂에 臥하얏더니 一異人이 先生께 拜하고 曰 余- 金剛山 楡岾寺에 在하야 百日 祈禱를 終하고 偶然히 塔下에서 小眠하다가 起 한즉 異書가 塔에 在한 지라 一見한 즉 그 字劃書義가 塵世에 刱見한 바요 凡智의 理解치 못할 바이라. 이에 是書의 解者를 求코저 하야 殆히 萬地遍踏 하더니 公을 見하매 始로 是書의 有傳을 知하겟사오니 請컨대 公은 其眞을 靈會하사 天賜를 勿負하소서. 先生이 收하야 見한 즉 儒佛仙 諸家중에 曾見치 못하던 바로 古無今無의 異書라. 異人에게 謂하야 曰 아즉 案에 留置하라. 異人이 曰 吾- 3日 後에 必히 再來하리니 公은 義會하소서. 異人이 果然 其期에 來하얏서늘 先生이 曰 義會하얏노라. 異人이 拜謝 曰 公은 실로 天人입니다 하고 遂下階에 因忽 不見이어늘 先生이 처음으로 그가 神靈의 幻像임을 知하얏다. 是書의 意義의 大略은 人乃天의 義이며 書 中에 49日 祈天의 義가 有한지라. 書意에 依하야 祈禱의 義를 決하얏다」한다.
翌年 丙辰 夏에 先生이 一衲子로 더부러 梁山 千聖山 內院庵에 入하야 祈禱를 始하다가 叔父의 逝去로 47日만에 其工을 中止하고 丁巳 秋에 更히 祈天의 事를 繼行 할새 外로 鐵店을 設하고 內로 祈天의 具를 備하야 苦難迫至의 中에서 49日의 祈禱를 畢하얏다.
己未 10月에 先生이 蔚山으로 부터 慶州 龍潭에 還居하얏는데 自是로 先生은 不出門外 盟誓하고 初名 濟宣을 改하야 濟愚라 하며 門楣에 「道氣長存邪不入, 世間衆人不同歸」의 立春詩 一聯을 揭하고 泉石에 逍遙하며 室內에 黙坐하야 全혀 沈思 冥想으로써 黙養 하다.
37歲 되던 庚申年 4月 5日이라. 先生은 例와 가티 沐浴齊戒하고 草堂에 靜坐하더니 문득 心身이 戰寒하야 疾을 執症치 못하고 言을 形狀키 難할 際에 仙語- 잇서 문득 耳 中에 入하더니 外로 接靈의 氣- 有하고 內로 降話의 敎- 有하되 視하야도 見치 못하고 聽하야도 聞치 못할지라. 先生이 驚起 探問한 즉 曰 勿懼勿恐 하라. 世人이 我를 謂하되 上帝라 하나니 汝- 上帝를 不知하느냐. 先生이 其所以然을 問한즉 曰 開闢 後 5萬年에 汝가 또한 처음이로다. 開闢 後 5萬年에 余- 또한 功이 업섯는지라. 이제 汝를 世間에 生하야 全人間에게 此 法을敎케 하나니 勿疑勿疑 하라. 先生曰 然則 西道(天主敎)로써 人을 敎하리니까?
「曰 不然하다. 吾의 心이 即 汝의 心이라. 人이 어찌 此를 知하리오. 天地는 知하되 鬼神은 知치 못하엿나니 鬼鬼神이라＜64＞ 함은 吾니라. 汝에게 無窮 無窮의 道를 授하노니 修하고 煉하야 其文을 制하야 人을 敎하고 其法을 定하야 德을 布하면 汝- 또한 長生하야 天下에 昭然하리라.
又曰 今世의 運이 戚하도다. 人慾이 天에 滔하고 道德이 地에 掃하야 彛倫이 已斁한지라 所謂 父父, 子子, 君君, 臣臣, 夫夫, 婦婦의 道가 余의 敍한 바에 違하고 守牧의 官이 虐民誤政하야 傷害가 多 할지니 汝- 가르쳐 化하야써 余의 大德을 順히 하라.
又曰 汝- 또한 人이엇나니 무엇을 知하엿스랴. 大運이 循環하야 世界의 億兆- 將次 同歸 一體하리니 汝- 正心修道하야 漸次 修煉하면 無窮造化- 다 던지고 布德天下될 것이니 次第道法이 這裏에 在하니라.」
先生은 이에 守心正氣하야 天道의 全體를 透察하얏스며 更히 一年의 修煉을 經하매 또한 自然의 理- 업지 아니한지라. 이로써 能히 國을 輔하고 民을 安하며 나아가 天下의 蒼生과 宇宙의 萬有를 克濟할 것을 確信하고 듸디어 簡單한 法門을 定하야 徒弟의 修煉 節次를 示하엿스니 이가 곳 朝鮮 東學 發祥의 其初이며 今日의 天道敎, 侍天敎 其他 2, 3의 敎團은 이 東學의 後身이다.
先生이 大覺 後 2年 辛酉에 四方 賢士- 風을 聞하고 來하는 者- 多하야 先生과 頻煩한 問答이 有하얏다. 이제 그 問答中의 數節을 摘記하면 이러하다.
「或이 問 曰 今에 天靈이 先生께 降臨하셧다 하오니 何故오니까? 曰 其無往不復의 理를 受함이니라. 그러면 何道라 名하나이까? 曰 天道니라. 西道와 無異합니까? 曰 運은 一 이오 道는 同하나 理인 즉 아니니라. 何故오니까? 曰 吾道는 無爲而化니라. 其心을 守하고 其氣를 正하고 其性을 率하고 其敎를 受하면 化- 自然의 中에서 出하나니라. 道가 同 하다 할진대 西學이라 名하나니이까. 曰 不然하다. 余- 東에서 生하야 東에서 學하엿스니 道- 비록 天道나 學이라 하면 東學이라 할지니 西를 어찌 東이라 하며 東을 어찌 西이라 하리오.」
勿論 當時 問答의 辭意가 이 뿐이 아니나, 爲先이 이로써도 能히 東學의 一斑을 窺知할 수 잇다. 先生은 이때에 龍潭詞와 敎訓詞를 草하야 徒弟에게 示하얏스며 繼하야 修道의 節을 定할 새 淸水를 奉奠하고 天主를 念하며 呪文을 誦하며 寢食 必告 하며 出入 必告하며 無惡 無貪 無淫으로써 心箴을 삼게 하라.
辛酉 6月에 先生은 湖南을 向하야 山川風土와 人心風俗을 視察하고 南原 隱寂庵에 到하야 더욱이 性을 煉하고 心을 修하며 道修詞와 權學詞를 草하야 徒弟에게＜65＞ 送하다.
先生의 道學이 日高하고 先生의 徒弟가 月增함과 共히 世間의 指目이 益甚하야 束學의 主張으로써 或은 斯文의 亂賊이라 하며 或은 西學과 異名同曲이라 하야 當時의 政府는 劒으로써 先生을 迫코저 할 새 先生은 大覺 後 4年 癸亥 8月 14日로써 守心正氣 4字를 書하야 此를 高弟 崔海月(名은 時亨이니 東學의 第 2世 敎祖)에게 與하며 一切 道事를 全혀 그에게 信托하고 더욱 一心으로 道를 傳하며 理를 講하야 當來할 運命을 隱然히 期待함과 如하얏다(興比歌, 不然其然歌, 前八節, 後八節, 嘆道儒心急 等의 書가 此 間에 成하다).
是歲 12月에 先生이 各地에 巡諭하더니 人이 急告하야 曰 「近日에 先生을 西學으로 指目 하야 朝廷에서 逮捕코저 하오니 先生은 自愛하소서.」 先生이 笑 曰 道- 我로부터 出하엿스니 我- 自當하리라. 어찌 逃避하야 累를 諸君에게 及하리오 하며 小毫도 動心치 아니하엿다. 이 달 10日에 至하야는 先生이 崔海月 外 10餘人의 門徒에게 諭하야 曰 今夜에 予- 特히 有事하니 汝等은 各各 歸家하라 하고 獨히 明燭達夜하야 相約한 人을 待함과 如하더니 是曉에 果然 宣傳官 鄭龜龍이 朝令으로 先生을 逮捕하얏다.
이 때 先生이 逮捕의 몸이 되어 鄭龜龍으로 더부러 京城을 向할 새 一行이 果川에 至하야 數日을 留 하더니 一日은 先生이 北天을 向하야 痛哭하거늘 一行이 其意를 問한대 先生이 但曰 未久에 可知라 하더니 翌朝에 宣傳官이 朝旨를 傳하되 今上(哲宗)이 崩하엿스니 東學先生 崔濟愚를 大邱營에 還囚하야 考訊以報하라 하얏더라.
甲子 1月 6日에 先生이 大邱에 至하니 當時의 監司 徐憲淳이 審問하야 曰 汝- 徒黨을 嘯聚하야 民俗을 淆亂하니 將次 何를 爲코저 하나뇨. 先生이 徐를 仰視하여 曰「予- 旡極大道로써 天下에 布코저 하노니 斯道의 出世는 天이 命한 바요 且 予의 一身으로써 道에 殉하야 德을 後天 5萬年에 布케 함도 또한 天의 命한 바이니 公은 오즉 自爲하라」하고 更히 他言이 無하얏다.
先生이 22次의 至酷한 拷問을 受하되 神色을 不變하얏스며 受訊時에 杖下에 霹靂聲이 起하야 屋宇가 震動하는지라. 左右가 失色하고 徐憲淳이 또한 驚하야 刑卒에게 問한 즉 是- 罪人의 折脛聲이라 하야 이에 下獄을 命하얏다. 先生 受刑 其時에는 體膚가 大傷하야 다시 完蘇의 望이 無하되 獄에 至하야는 一般 傷處가 無하고 殆히 完人과 同한지라. 옥리가 모다 그 神異함을 ＜66＞ 驚嘆하얏다 한다.
先生이 獄에 在하야 密히 崔海月 高弟를 接見하고 「燈明水上無嫌隙 柱似枯形力有餘」의 一聯과 「高飛遠走」의 四字를 書하야 心紙를 作하야 烟管에 揷入하야써 海月高弟에게 授하고 大道의 將來를 切切히 付托하다.
3月 10日에 先生이 所謂 「左道亂正律」로 刑을 大邱 將營에서 受할새 再三 劒을 下하되 小毫의 劒痕이 無한지라. 監司 以下 四圍가 皆驚하야 所措를 不知하더니 先生이 泰然히 刑卒에게 謂하야 曰 汝- 淸水 一器를 我前에 持來하랴. 刑卒이 淸水를 持來하거늘 先生이 淸水에 對하야 黙念良久에 復曰 淸水를 撤去하라 하고 곳 刑에 就하얏다. (奉淸水黙念은 先生이 定한 東學 儀式의 一)
是時에 門徒 金敬弼, 金敬叔, 鄭龍瑞, 郭德元, 林益瑞, 全德元 等이 先生의 屍體를 收하야 慈仁縣 西後淵店에 至 하얏는데 屍體가 尙溫하며 身首相續處에 紅白線이 有 하거늘 門徒 「屍體를 守한지 3日 朝에 彩虹이 淵에 起하며 瑞雲이 屋을 繞하더니 虹消雲捲 하고 尸汁이 始出 한지라. 이에 龜尾山下 龍潭前麓에 葬하니 先生의 時年이 41 이엇다.

先生의 蹶起와 그 環境
先生이 人乃天의 眞理를 大覺한 庚申의 年은 西紀 1860年에 當하얏나니 當時 東洋의 天地는 實로 動橈를 極하얏도다. 是에 先하야 英國은 1839年에 鴉片戰爭을 起하야 所謂 「南京條約」의 締結로써 淸國의 香港을 取한 以外에 2,100萬 弗의 賠償金을 徵收하얏스며 그 後 1856年에 英佛 兩國은 更히 其軍을 聯合하야 天津을 占하고 北京에 迫하야 所謂「北京條約」을 締結하야써 淸國의 土地와 償金을 아울러 割取하매 東西의 大地는 문득 西人의 威壓 下에 立하게 되엇스며 朝鮮으로 말하면 純祖 31年 辛卯(1831年)에 英吉利人의 船艦이 洪州郡 古代島에 現하야 上下의 驚異를 招한 中 惠宗 11年 乙巳(1845年)에 英人이 通商을 固請하얏고 同12年 丙午에는 佛蘭西의 軍艦이 洪州郡外烟島에 來하야 其威를 示하얏스며 일즉이 正祖朝부터 盛行할 氣勢를 現出하던 基督舊敎 即 當時의 所云 天主學은 憲宗朝에 入하야 洋人의 來往의 頻煩과 共히 時勢-益隆하야 朝廷의 嚴禁이 有 하얏슴에 不拘하고 그 堂을 立하고 그 道를 行하야 擧國의 人心이 將次 그 便으로 趨向할 慮- 有하얏다. 그런 中 ＜67＞ 當時 朝鮮의 內情을 回想하면 百有餘年에 亙한 黨爭의 茶毒으로 政敎가 墜地하야 純祖朝에 入하야는 極度의 衰弱을 致하얏스며 龍岡人 洪景來의 革命(純祖 11年 辛未)이 失敗된 以後로 政府의 勢力을 背景으로 한 地方의 貪官汚吏의 暴虐(革命의 反動)은 더욱 甚하야 生民의 困苦가 極 하얏섯다.
右를 約言하면 自純祖朝 至哲宗朝 年間의 朝鮮은 內로 政敎의 廢弛가 極하고 外로 西人의 出現이 頻煩하매 朝野의 人心은 紛亂하야 그 向할 바를 不知하얏다. 更言하면 內危外患이 交至 하얏다.
그런 中 先生은 일즉이 16歲 時 (憲宗 5年 己亥)로부텨 當時의 世道 人心에 慨然함이 有하야 此世는 孔孟의 德으로도 足히 論치 못할지오 堯舜의 治로도 足히 言치 못하리라 하야 自己 先考가 平生으로 攻究하던 儒家의 書類를 一朝에 燒盡하고 或은 弓馬, 販泉에, 或은 高山長谷에 그 心志를 自苦하며 그 筋骨을 自勞하야 憂鬱不樂 하던 中 東洋의 風雲은 日로 急하야 朝鮮과 脣齒의 勢를 가진 中國이 먼저 西人의 蹂躪 하에 入코저 하며 그 餘勢는 문득 朝鮮에 侵潤하야 上下가 震駭하며 其中 基督舊敎의 傳布는 當時 朝鮮人의 精神을 一擧에 征服할 形勢가 有하매 先生은 써하되 國內의 政敎- 如斯히 廢弛하고 國外의 大勢- 如許히 變轉하는 此際에 在하야 吾人으로의 對策이 無하면 朝鮮- 아니 東洋의 將來를 어찌하며 天下의 世道를 어찌할고 하야 이에 不出門外 盟誓하고 斷斷一念으로써 大勢의 挽回에 苦心하던 中 庚申 4月에 듸디어 物物天 事事天의 眞理를 覺得하고 同歸一軆의 大理想을 携하야 戰勝攻取로써 唯一의 人生觀을 삼은 西洋人의 誤謬를 根本的으로 矯正하고 虛僞怠惰로써 第2의 心性을 作한 東洋人의 萎靡를 一擧에 復活케 하야 그 德을 天下에 布하는 同時에 널리 世間의 蒼生을 廣濟 하리라 하얏다.
이것은 記者의 考察이 아니라 先生의 親筆에 成한 諸書에 歷歷히 그와 가튼 辭意를 述盡 하얏나니 그 「布德文」 中의 1節 에는 曰 「挽近以來 一世之人 各自爲心 不順天命 不顧天理 心常悚然 莫知所向」 이라 하야 國內人心의 廢弛를 痛嘆하고 更히 「西洋 戰勝攻取 無事不成 而天下盡滅 亦不無 脣亡之嘆 輔國安民 計將安出 惜哉 於今世人 未知時運...」을 말하야 政治的 物質的으로 迫來하는 外患이 如何히 切迫함을 論하고 「論學文」에서는 다시 一步를 進하야 「西洋之人 道成德立 及其造化 無事不成 攻鬪干戈 無人在前 中國消滅 ＜68＞ 豈可無脣亡之患耶 都緣無他 斯人 道稱西道學稱天主 敎則聖敎 此非知天時而受天命耶 擧此 一一不已故 吾亦悚然 只有恨生晩之際...」라 云云하야 西洋人의 勢力은 그 根據가 其國 民心의 健全에 在하고 그 標榜이 敬天愛人(今日로 말하면 正義人道)에 在하야 그 勢- 可侮치 못할 것은 勿論이오 單純한 政治의 勢力 뿐으로써 此에 對峙치 못할 것을 指摘하엿스며 又云 「吾道의 無爲而化矣 守其心 正其氣 率其性 受其敎 化出於自然之中」이라 하야 어대까지 標榜的이오 區分的이오 占有的인 西洋 文敎와 自別함이 有함을 表明하얏다.

先生 思想의 眞髓
「侍天主造化定永世不忘萬事知」- 先生의 思想의 眞諦는 全혀 右의 13字에 包括 되엇스며 13字 中에도 侍天主라는 3字가 最奧義를 所有하얏다. 先生은 自己가 詠한 歌詞에서 「13字 至極하면 萬卷 詩書 무엇하랴」 하엿스며 先生의 高弟 崔海月은 그 門徒를 對하면 每樣 「侍天主」의 뜻을 了解하느냐고 質한 것을 볼지라도 그 13字- 中에도 侍天主의 3字가 如何히 必要함을 알 것이다.
그러면 先生의 所謂 侍天主라 함은 무엇이냐.

先生의 說明에 依하면 當世의 人은 天主라는 그 「天」에 對한 觀念이 全혀 그 當을 失하얏다. 卽 「天」이라 하면 自己를 除하고 天地의 萬有를 除하고 風雨霜雪을 除하고 그 以上에 超越하야 잇는 別個의 무슨 主宰者와 神이라고 思惟하얏다. 그래서 世間의 人人은 四時의 變遷과 雨露의 降下로써 天主의 施與하는 恩典이라 하얏스며 天地間의 羣生으로써 天主가 造出한 一種의 別物이라 認識하얏다. 그리하야 世間에 存在한 物과 物間에는 何等의 脉絡이 有함을 不認하며 딸아서 日月의 運行, 雨露의 降下와 如한 自然界의 現狀에 對하야 何等의 靈感을 不認하얏다. 於時乎 一世의 人은 各自 爲心하야 天理를 不順하며 天命을 不顧하고 서로 侵掠하고 虐待하며 讒誣하고 中傷하며 非自然의 階級과 虛僞의 言行을 捏造하야써 淆薄粗暴 한 世間을 化作한다.
그러나 實際의 天主라 함은 그와 가튼 宇宙의 萬有를 超越한 別個의 것이 아니다. 自然의 便으로 말하면 春秋의 秩代와 四時의 盛衰가 都是 天主의 跡이오 人事의 便으로 말하면 一動 一靜, 一盛 一敗가 亦是 天主의 跡이며 그리고 上으로 大天星辰, 下으로 鳥獸昆蟲 어느 ＜69＞ 것이 天主의 顯現 아님이 업는지라. 고로 吾人은 誰이나 天主를 侍치 아니한 者- 無하며 自己의 侍한 天主를 自己各自가 軆認하는 同時에 吾人은 곳 萬有의 侍한 天主 即 全體로의 天主를 軆認하게 될지며 全體로의 天主를 軆認하는 때에 비롯오 人間의 億兆는 同歸一軆할지며 人間의 億兆가 同歸 一軆하는 때에 宇宙의 生은 完全히 救濟하리라 하얏다.
그 大軆의 思想이 이러한지라. 그 結果는 當然히 이러한 解釋을 取하게 된다.
1. 先生의 思想下에는 一切의 區分을 認하지 못하게 된다. 即 從來에는 天과人은 區分하고, 人과 物을 區分하고 人과 人을 區分하야 其間의 直接 交通을 禁하고 或은 渴仰하며 或은 仇讎視 하며 或은 虐使 함으로써 自稱 曰可라 하얏스나 이 宇宙의 萬有로써 天의 顯現이라 認한 先生의 思想에서는 이러한 區分을 不認하고 相互間의 扶助와 感激 뿐 으로써 그 生을 大하게 할 것이니 先生의 所謂 「同歸一軆」가 卽此이다.
2. 宇宙進化의 無窮을 認하는 同時에 人生 自體의 進化의 無窮을 認하게 된다. 卽 從來에는 天人을 區分視 하야 天으로써 旣成한 權能의 者라 하고 人으로써 天의 造出에 係한 一種의 靈物이라 하야 人間의 靈長을 是認하는 一面으로 人間의 進路를 스스로 制限한 觀이 有하나. 先生의 天與物을 純然한 一軆로 觀한 同時에 此는 尙又無窮히 進化할 途中에 잇는 未成의 者라 하얏나니 曰 無極大道라 하며 曰 無窮無窮 萬事知라 함이 卽 此 이다.
3. 모든 向上과 모든 解決을 自我로부터 求하게 된다. 天與物을 純然 是 一軆로 보는 結果는 當然히 모든 問題를 自我로 부텨 處辨하게 되나니 自我를 餘하고 다시 더듬을 곳이 업는 故이다. 曰 「不知明之所在 遠不求而修我 不知德之所在 料吾身之化生 不知命之所在 顧吾心之明明 不知道之所在度吾 信之一如」라 함은 이 便의 消息을 말함이다.

先生의 思想을 演述코저 하면 限이 업다. 그런데 이는 「人乃天의 硏究」라 하야 本誌에 누차 發表된 것이 有함으로 重複의 嫌을 避하야 이로써 畧한다.

先生의 出現과 그 波紋
近代 又는 現代의 朝鮮, 아니, 東洋에 잇서 先生의 出現이 ＜70＞ 果然 如何한 影響을 及하얏스며 또 及하는 中에 잇는가 함은 우리의 贅言을 不待하고 一般이 善知하는 바어니와 先生이 距今 60餘年 前의 朝鮮에 잇서 昏夢이 正酣한 當時에 잇서 일즉이 朝鮮의 將來- 아니 世間의 將來를 憂慮하고 唯獨히 懷疑하며 煩悶하며 大悟하야 人人天物物天의 眞理를 把持하고 輔國安民, 布德天下, 廣濟蒼生의 大旗幟을 揚하다가 時- 非하고 事- 違하는 一朝에 그 一命을 大邱將臺에 投하야 眞理의 最後 勝利를 永遠에 求함과 如함은 吾人이 그 云謂할 바를 不知하도다.
先生이 一去 後 先生의 思想과 主義는 日로 世間에 宣傳하야 今日에 至하야는 先生의 主義에 徇한 자 뿐으로 約 40萬(東學亂 以後)을 算하얏스며 先生을 大神師로 信仰하는 者는 그 幾百萬 임을 不知하게 되엇스며 이 뿐 아니라 先生의 思想은 人乃天主義의 稱號 下에서 朝鮮은 勿論, 全 人間의 心靈에 浸潤되고저 하는 今日이다.
一言으로 盡 하면 先生은 近代 朝鮮의 太陽이며 人文 開闢의 炬火이다.＜71＞
