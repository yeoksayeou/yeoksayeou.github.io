初雪
						玄星

Snow falls!
Snow falls!
On New Year's Day,
Snow falls!
Because the setting sun has died,
The mountains, rivers, grass, and trees
Have put on mourning clothes.

Snow falls!
Snow falls!
On New Year's Day,
Snow falls!
Because the Devil-God has died,
It is resplendent.
A ritual to Heaven,

Snow falls!
Snow falls!
On New Year's Day,
Snow falls!
The black flowers wither and fall,
It is a Silver World.
White flowers have bloomed.

But, ah! But
In the garden where I grew up,
Under the bright Morning Sun,
Fully bloomed,
My most beloved
White flower!
What black hand plucked it away?

Oh! Now
The children are far across the sea,
On this distant land,
Having lost the white flower too,
Wandering without house or temple,
In my parents' aging eyes,
Even the white snow <50>
Must look black.

But rest assured,
Father, Mother,
In my siblings'
Hearts has bloomed
A red flower!
How could it be plucked by hand,
Or cut with a sword?

「꿈이 아니엿드면」   1923. 1. 3. 玄星
(If It Were Not a Dream)

Oh! Was that a dream!
Without even one *mu* of farmland (一畝田土),
Without even one thatched hut (一間草屋),
Pitiful me,
In someone else's splendid rivers and mountains,
Building a golden palace with jade pavilions,
Below wind-swept
Paektu Mountain (白頭山),
After a long separation,
Thinking of me,
Or perhaps resenting me,
With my lover,
Joyfully, happily—
It was the greatest happiness,
Oh! Was that a dream!
If it were not a dream,
Oh! I would have
Shed red blood on the execution block (斷頭臺)!
But, is it fortunate that it was a dream?
Would it be fortunate if it were not a dream?
Without even one *mu* of farmland,
Without even one thatched hut,
Without a lover, I,
Oh! If only it were not a dream!
Oh! If only it were not a dream!
Oh! Rather, if only it were not a dream!
-Written on New Year's Day- <51>

**Summary**

The first poem, "First Snow," uses the imagery of snow on New Year's Day to evoke complex emotions. Initially, snow represents mourning for the past year ("setting sun") but also a pure, celebratory cleansing ("Devil-God has died," "Silver World"). However, this shifts to personal and national loss: a cherished "white flower" (symbolizing innocence, purity, or perhaps Korea itself) plucked by a "black hand," and parents displaced and suffering ("children far across the sea," "wandering"). Yet, it ends with resilience symbolized by an unyielding "red flower" (hope, resistance) in the hearts of the siblings. The second poem, "If It Were Not a Dream," starkly contrasts the speaker's destitute reality (landless, homeless, loveless) with a vivid dream of immense happiness (wealth, reunion with a lover near Paektu Mountain). The speaker paradoxically wishes the dream were real, even knowing it might lead to execution, highlighting the extreme desperation and perhaps the dangerous nature (e.g., related to independence aspirations) of such dreams under oppression.

Historians might find these poems valuable for their raw depiction of the psychological impact of Japanese colonial rule. They illustrate themes of loss, displacement, poverty, suppressed longing, and the concurrent feelings of despair and resilient hope ("red flower"). The mention of Paektu Mountain, a potent national symbol, and the intense yearning for an alternative reality, even at the cost of death ("斷頭臺"), underscore the deep-seated desire for freedom and a restored national identity during this period. The poems reflect the complex blend of sorrow and resistance characteristic of Korean cultural expression under colonialism.

오! 그것이 꿈이엇든가!
一畝田土도 업고
一間草屋도 업는
可憐한 내가,
華麗한 남의 江山에
金殿玉樓를 짓고
찬 바람 부는
白頭山 下에
離別한 後 오래동안
나를 생각하고
或은 나를 원망하는
나의 愛人으로 더불어
喜喜樂樂-
第一 幸福이엇드니,
오! 그것이 꿈이엇든가!
萬一 꿈이 아니엇드면
오! 나는 斷頭臺에
紅血을 홀렷슬 것을!
그러나, 그것이 꿈이엇드면 多幸일가?
그것이 꿀이 아니엿드면 多幸일가?
一畝田土도 업고
一間草屋도 업고
愛人도 업는 나는
오! 그것이 꿈이 아니엇드면!
오! 그것이 꿈이 아니엇드면!
오히려 그것이 꿈이 아니엇드면!
