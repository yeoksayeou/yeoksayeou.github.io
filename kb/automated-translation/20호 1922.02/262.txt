Regarding the advertisement for Susan Pharmacy (壽山藥房) at Kyŏngsŏng, Chongno 2-ch'ŏmoku, 5-bŏnchi, published in the New Year enlarged issue: the transfer account number "振替 京城 七三四一番" (Transfer Kyŏngsŏng 7341) should be corrected to "振替 京城 七六四一番" (Transfer Kyŏngsŏng 7641). Regarding the New Year greeting advertisement from U Chŏng-mu (禹鼎舞) of Sipcha Hospital in Anju-gun Ŭpnae, and Yi Ki-hong (李基弘) of Kŏnin-ni, Anju-gun Ŭpnae: "U Chŏng-mu" (禹鼎舞) should be corrected to "U P'il-mu" (禹弼舞), and "Yi Ki-hong" (李基弘) should be corrected to "Yi Ki-hong" (李基泓). We hereby make these corrections.

**Summary**

This is a correction notice published by the Gaebyeoksa Advertising Department in the February 1922 issue of *Gaebyeok* magazine. It rectifies errors found in advertisements from the previous New Year's enlarged issue. Specifically, it corrects a bank transfer number for Susan Pharmacy located in Chongno, Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul), and corrects the Hanja characters used for the names of two individuals, U P'il-mu of Sipcha Hospital and Yi Ki-hong, both from Anju-gun, who had placed a joint New Year greeting advertisement. For historians, this small notice provides valuable micro-details about early 1920s colonial Korea: the specific addresses and names of businesses (pharmacy, hospital) and individuals, the prevalence of Hanja in daily use (including nuanced corrections), the existence of regional advertisers using a major Kyŏngsŏng-based magazine, and the use of financial systems like bank/postal transfers (振替).
