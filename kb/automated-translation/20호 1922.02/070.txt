A Special Case in the Hamhŭng Lawyers' Circle

Mr. Sin Sŏk-chŏng (申錫定), famous in the Hamhŭng (咸興) lawyers' circle, has taken upon himself the duty of defending human rights and is setting an unprecedented example (特例). The general points are as follows (左와 如함):

1.  To maintain harmony (和誼) among the same people (民族), lawsuit cases are, as much as possible, handled with the aim of mediation (仲裁) and reconciliation (和解).

1.  For parties in a lawsuit who lack financial means (無資力), the cases are handled without remuneration (無報酬).

1.  Lawsuits concerning public organizations (公共團體) and other public interest projects (公益事業) are handled without remuneration if, upon appraisal (鑑定), there are grounds for legality (適法).

1.  For lawsuit cases, if, upon appraisal (鑑定), the facts (事實) are unjust (不正當), representation (委任) is refused entirely (一切).<55>

**Summary**

The article reports on the noteworthy practices of Sin Sŏk-chŏng, a lawyer in Hamhŭng. He prioritizes mediation and reconciliation in disputes among Koreans, offers pro bono services to the poor and for public interest cases deemed legally sound, and refuses cases where the facts appear unjust. From a colonial history perspective, this piece is interesting as it highlights a Korean professional consciously working to foster harmony within the Korean community ("가튼 民族間의 和誼") and providing aid to the disadvantaged under Japanese rule. It reflects an assertion of ethical principles and social responsibility, potentially serving as a subtle counterpoint to the colonial power structure, focusing on internal community support and justice.
