**Summary**

This "Social Diary" from February 1922 compiles news snippets from January, covering a wide range of topics relevant to Korea under Japanese rule and the wider world. It reports on the suppression of the Korean magazine *Kaebyŏk*, economic news like postal rate and tax increases, trade figures, educational developments (Posŏng College, Kyŏngsŏng school fees, Taegu school initiative, co-education ordinance), social activities (religious meetings, association inaugurations, strikes), clashes between Korean independence fighters and Japanese police, international affairs like the Washington Naval Conference and the Irish Free State, and news from Japan and China. It also notes demographic information about Koreans in Tokyo and the deaths of prominent figures like Ōkuma Shigenobu and Kim Yun-sik.

For historians, this article offers a valuable snapshot of the multifaceted reality of colonial Korea in early 1922. It juxtaposes official colonial actions (budget, tax increases, education policies, suppression of press) with Korean responses (independence activities, formation of cultural/economic groups, debates over public figures like Kim Yun-sik, establishment of self-governing communities abroad like Sinhan Ch'on). The detailed statistics on Koreans in Tokyo and the reporting on international events affecting Korea (like the Washington Conference) provide context for understanding Korean society's internal dynamics and its position within the broader geopolitical landscape of the time. The mention of censorship and the reporters' association (Mumyŏnghoe) fighting against it highlights the struggle for freedom of expression.
