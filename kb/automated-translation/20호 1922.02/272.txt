◀Apology Notice▶

Although we have previously apologized in the newspapers, we are truly ashamed and have no words to explain how this magazine, which was supposed to be published on the 1st, is now being published on the 8th. This is indeed the first time such a thing has happened since the founding of Kaebyŏk.

As many of you know, in the short period of the past twenty-odd days, our company has been truly busy. The New Year's issue was confiscated, a special issue was published, then banned (絶版), and then reprinted again; amidst being so busy we had no time to even open our eyes (눈코새업시), we were greatly affected by the printing house's closure for the lunar year-end and New Year holidays.

Our company tried endlessly, gritting our teeth, not to show laziness to everyone and not to bear the blame for breaking trust, but the strict publication date passed relentlessly without regard for personal circumstances. Since things have come to this (事已至此), what can be done? We would be ashamed but deeply grateful if you would press down [your displeasure] with a heart that loves this magazine, offer forgiveness, and give us even more sympathy.

If only the content were substantial to compensate for the delayed publication, we would not feel excessively sorry, but it is difficult to guarantee how that too will appear to you all.

This time, we take all the blame upon ourselves and pledge that we will surely shed this blame with the March issue. Please grant us your forbearance.

Kaebyŏk Company <73>

**Summary**

The publisher, Kaebyŏk Company (開闢社), issues a formal apology for the one-week delay in publishing issue 20 of *Kaebyŏk* magazine in February 1922. They explain the delay resulted from significant disruptions, including the confiscation (押收) of their New Year's issue by authorities, the subsequent publication and banning (絶版) of a special issue, followed by a reprinting, all further complicated by printing house closures during the Lunar New Year holiday. They express deep regret and ask for readers' understanding, promising to make amends with the upcoming March issue. This notice is significant for colonial Korean history as it explicitly documents the operational difficulties and censorship faced by Korean publishers under Japanese rule. Historians would find the direct references to confiscation and banning valuable evidence of the pressures and control exerted on the Korean press during this period.
