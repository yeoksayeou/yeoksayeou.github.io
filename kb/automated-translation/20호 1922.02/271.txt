The continued manuscript of the novel 『The Turkey』 (七面鳥) could not be published in this issue due to the author's circumstances.<70>

**Summary**

This brief editorial note explains that the next installment of the serialized novel "The Turkey" (七面鳥) was omitted from issue number 20 due to the author's "circumstances" (事故, sago). Such notices were common in periodicals, reflecting the challenges of serialized publication. For historians, the term "사고" (sago - circumstances/incident) is interesting; while it could mean a genuine personal issue for the author, it was also sometimes used as a euphemism for delays caused by censorship or other external pressures common during the colonial period.
