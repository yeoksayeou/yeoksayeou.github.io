二千年 前의 勞農主義者-墨子
						小春

Yang Chu (楊朱) and Mo Ti (墨翟)! When these names are mentioned, one thinks of heresy, and when heresy is mentioned, we couldn't even speak of it. Consequently, while we knew how to curse the names Yang Chu and Mo Ti, we knew nothing else besides that.

However, Meng-tzu (孟子) stated that the words of Yang Chu and Mo Ti filled the world (天下に盈햇다). From this, we can understand how widely their doctrines were propagated at the time, and simultaneously, how much influence and value they possessed. Yang Chu's writings were not transmitted later, with only the Yang Chu chapter in the *Lieh-tzu* (列子) remaining. As for Mo Ti, according to tradition, there were 71 chapters of his writings, but only 15 volumes survive today. The essence (精義) of Mo Ti's doctrines can often be seen more clearly in the writings of others from that time, which further shows how valuable his doctrines were.

So, what kind of thought and principles did Mo Ti hold? Rather than relying directly on Mo Ti's own writings, it is clearer to examine the critiques of Mo Ti by other schools that opposed him. Meng-tzu said:

"Mo Ti advocated universal love (兼愛). If grinding his head smooth and wearing out his heels would benefit the world (利天下), he would do it." He also said, "Mo Ti's love makes no distinctions (愛無差等); this is to be without a father (是無父也)." And Chuang-tzu (莊者) said:

"Mo Ti followed the Way of Yü (禹之道), personally handling the spade and basket (親操槀耟), working until the hair was worn off his calves (腓無胈) and shins (脛無毛), drenched by heavy rain (沐甚雨), his hair combed by fierce winds (櫛疾風), wearing coarse hemp or fur clothing (裘褐爲衣) and simple footwear (跂蹻爲服), taking self-suffering as his ultimate goal (以自苦爲極)." He also said, "Mo Ti did not follow the ancient kings; he destroyed the rites and music (禮樂) of antiquity."

And the *Huai-nan Yao-lüeh Hsün-shuo* (淮南要略訓說) states: <21>

"Mo Ti received the teachings of the Confucian school (儒者之業) and studied the arts of Confucius (孔子之術), but considered its principles cumbersome and impractical (煩擾而不侻). He believed elaborate funerals (厚葬) wasted wealth and impoverished the people, and prolonged mourning (久服) injured life and harmed affairs. Therefore, he turned his back on the Way of Chou (周道) and employed the governance of Hsia (夏政)."

And Ssu-ma T'an's (司馬談) *Discussion on the Essentials of the Six Schools* (論 六家要書) says:

"The Mohists also esteemed the Way of Yao (堯) and Shun (舜), speaking of their virtuous conduct, saying: '[Their palaces were] halls three *ch'ih* high, with earthen steps of three levels, thatched roofs untrimmed, rafters unplaned. They ate from earthenware vessels (食土?), sipping simple broths (啜士刑?), eating coarse grains and vegetable soup (梁之食藜藿之羹). In summer, they wore hemp clothing (葛衣), in winter, deerskin cloaks (鹿裘). For funerals, they used paulownia coffins three inches thick. Their mourning [music] (*音) did not exhaust their grief. They taught that mourning rites must follow this pattern for all people. If so, then there would be no distinction between high and low (尊卑無別). In essence, their strengthening the root and economizing on expenditure (强本節用) is the way for people to be supplied and households sufficient."

And figures like Hsün-tzu (荀子) greatly criticized Mo Ti, yet their criticisms反而 reveal Mo Ti's true intentions. He said:

"[They] do not understand the authority (權) needed to unify the world (壹天下) and establish the state (建國家). They emphasize merit and utility (功用), practice extreme frugality (大儉約), and infringe upon distinctions of rank (侵差等). They are insufficient even to tolerate different opinions (辨異) or establish [proper relations between] ruler and minister (縣君臣). This is Mo Ti and Sung K'eng (宋鈃)." He also said, "If Mo Ti were to possess the whole world, or even a small state, he would reduce the number of followers, decrease officials and posts, value effort and hard labor (上功苦勞), share tasks equally with the common people (與百姓均事業), and equalize rewards (齊功勞). If so, there would be no authority (不威)."

Looking at these points broadly, it is clear that Mo Ti disliked how the Confucian school (儒家者流) was imprisoned (拘囚) by shallow ethical thought, emphasizing distinctions and ranks, abusing rites, music, punishments, and administration (禮樂刑政), fundamentally drying up human emotion (人間의 感激을 枯渴시키고), and busying itself with trivial details (末節). At the same time, he advocated and practiced the principles of universal love (兼愛), equality without distinction (無差等), and direct labor (直接勞動). However, the most distinctive feature (特点) of Mo Ti is that he was more of a practitioner of principles (主義者) than merely a thinker. The *Huai-nan-tzu* (淮南子說) states, "Mo Ti had 180 followers in his service (服役者 180人), all of whom could be made to jump into fire or tread on blades (赴火蹈刃), facing death without turning back (死不旋踵)." The *Hsin-yü* (新語說) states, "Among Mo Ti's disciples (墨子之門), there were many brave warriors (多勇士)." And the *Han Fei-tzu* (韓非子說) states, "The Mohists used force to violate prohibitions (墨以武犯禁)." Inferring from these, it is clear that Mo Ti united people who resonated (共鳴) with his principles and aimed (圖한) to realize these principles through direct action. In this respect, Mo Ti can be recognized as a Labor-Farmer-ist (勞農主義者) from 2000 years ago, and at the same time, there is a particular need for us to understand his thought and actions. <22>

**Summary**

This article re-evaluates the ancient Chinese philosopher Mo Ti (Mokja), traditionally dismissed as a heretic in the Confucian tradition, arguing he was a "Labor-Farmer-ist" (勞農主義者) from 2,000 years ago. The author, Soch'un, uses criticisms from Confucian and Taoist texts (Mencius, Zhuangzi, Xunzi, etc.) to highlight Mo Ti's core tenets: universal love (兼愛), equality (無差等), frugality, emphasis on practical utility, rejection of elaborate rituals and hierarchy, and promotion of direct labor and self-sacrifice for the common good. The article stresses Mo Ti's role not just as a thinker but as an activist who organized followers for direct action. For historians, this piece is interesting as it reflects the intellectual currents of 1920s colonial Korea, where historical figures were being reinterpreted through modern ideological lenses like socialism or proto-socialism ("Labor-Farmer-ism"). It shows an attempt to find indigenous or historical precedents for contemporary radical thought, positioning Mo Ti as an ancient advocate for the working classes against elite Confucianism.

二千年 前의 勞農主義者-墨子
						小春
楊朱墨翟이라 하면, 異端을 연상하고, 이단이라 하면 우리는 말도 부치지 못하엿섯다. 따라서 우리는 楊朱墨翟이라 하면 욕을 할 줄은 알앗스나 그밧게는 아모 것도 몰낫다.
그런대 孟子에 가로되 楊朱墨翟의 言이 천하에 盈햇다고 하엿다. 그러면 그 두 사람의 학설이 당시에 얼마나 盛히 선전되엿는 것을 알 수 잇는 동시에 역시 얼마나 세력, 가치가 잇섯는 것을 알 수가 잇다. 楊朱의 글은 후에 전한 것이 업고 오즉 列子에 楊朱篇이 잇슬 뿐이며, 墨子에 니르러는 傳에 의하면 71篇의 저서가 잇다하나 지금에 현존한 것은 15권에 지내지 못하며, 墨子 학설의 精義는 오히려 당시의 他人의 저서에서 만히 볼 수가 잇는 바, 그의 학설이 엇더케 가치가 잇섯던 것을 또 여긔에서 볼 수가 잇다.
그러면 묵자는 엇더한 사상, 주의를 가젓던가. 이것은 직접으로 墨子의 저서에 의함보다는, 墨子와 반대되는 他家의 墨子에 대한 비평으로써 보는 것이 오히려 분명하니, 孟子는 가로되,
「墨子兼愛, 磨頂放踵, 利天下爲之」 又曰 「墨子愛無差等, 是無父也」라 하고, 莊者는 가로되
「墨子法禹之道, 親操槀耟, 腓無*, 脛無毛, 沐甚雨, 櫛疾風, 裘褐爲衣, 跂蹻爲服, 以自苦爲極」 又曰 「墨子不與先王同, 毁古之禮樂」
이라하고, 淮南要略訓說에는 가로되＜21＞
「墨子受儒者之業學孔子之術, 以爲其理煩擾而不侻, 厚葬屝財而貧民, 久服傷生而害事故, 背周道而用夏政」
이라하엿고 司馬談論 六家要書에는 가로되
「墨者亦尙堯舜之道, 言其德行, 曰高堂三尺, 土階三等, 茅茨不剪, 釆椽不刮, 食土*, 啜士刑*梁之食藜藿之羹, 夏日葛衣, 冬日鹿裘, 其送死桐棺三寸, *音不盡其哀, 敎喪禮必以此爲萬民之率, 若此則尊卑無別也, 要其强本節用則人給家足之道也」
라 하엿스며, 荀子와 가튼 이는 크게 墨子를 비난하엿는대, 비난한 그 말이 도로혀 墨子의 진의를 現示하엿스니 가로되
「不知壹天下建國家之權, 稱上功用, 大儉約而侵差等, 曾不足以容辨異, 縣君臣, 是墨翟宋鈃也」 又曰 「墨子大有天下小有一國, 將少人徒, 省官職, 上功苦勞, 與百姓均事業, 齊功勞, 若是則不威」
라 하엿다. 大略 이로써 본다 할지라도, 墨子는 儒家者流가 천박한 윤리사상에 拘囚되야, 구별 차등을 重視하고 禮樂刑政을 남용하야, 근본적으로 인간의 감격을 고갈식히고, 末節에 분주하는 그것을 미워하는 동시에, 兼愛, 無差等, 직접노동의 主義를 제창 실천한 者임이 분명하다. 그런대 墨子에게 잇서 가장 特点이 되는 것은 그는 사상가인 것 보담 主義者가 되엿던 그것이다. 淮南子說에는 墨子服役者 180人, 皆可使赴火蹈刃, 死不旋踵」이라 하얏고, 新語說에는 「墨子之門, 多勇士」라 하얏고, 韓非子說에는 「墨以武犯禁」이라 한 바, 이로써 推察하면, 墨子는 자기의 主義에 共鳴하는 사람을 단결하야, 직접 행동으로써 主義의 실현을 圖한 것이 분명하니, 이 점에서 墨子는 2000년 전의 勞農主義者라 認할 수 잇는 同時에 그의 사상이나 행위에 잇서, 우리는 格別히 알아볼 필요가 잇다한다.＜22＞
