High/Low, Noble/Base, Exalted/Mean: These are the Foundational Concepts of Confucian Thought
						By Ki Ch'an (Compiled)

Truly, it must be said. When I think about Confucianism, my heart feels somehow stifled, disgruntled, and so unpleasant that I cannot bear it. To think of the circumstances where the relationship between people is so terribly bound by the relations of noble/base (尊卑), high/low (上下), exalted/mean (貴賤) through the so-called Three Bonds (三綱) and Five Relationships (五倫), and its implementation further guaranteed by Rites, Music, Punishment, and Administration (禮樂刑政), preventing the masses of the world for all future generations from stepping even one foot outside of it – it is truly a detestable, detestable thing. Moreover, when I think of how we Korean people have been pickled and pickled again in that ideology for hundreds of years, and even in this situation where we are currently facing the destruction of our livelihood, we cannot leap out from the shackles of that thought, meaning we hesitate even at ideological revolution – who could restrain their hatred towards this? This is not just the prejudice of this writer alone; the views of scholars from China (中國), the place where this Confucian thought originated, are also the same. Now, if I excerpt the critique of Confucian thought by Mr. O U (吳虞氏), a giant in the Chinese intellectual world:

Filial Piety – This is the Sole Basis of Absolutism
The *Koumingchüeh* (鉤命決) records the words of Confucius (孔子), saying, "My will is in the *Spring and Autumn Annals* (春秋), and my conduct is in the *Classic of Filial Piety* (孝經)." Mencius (孟子) said, "The world declined and the Way faded; heterodox doctrines and violent deeds arose. There were ministers who murdered their rulers, and sons who murdered their fathers. Confucius (孔子) was alarmed by this and wrote the *Spring and Autumn Annals* (春秋)." Tung Chung-shu (董仲舒) said, "Confucius' (孔子) clarification of gain and loss and his division of the exalted and mean was the fundamental policy to return to the Kingly Way. Therefore, the principle that the people follow the ruler, <14> the ruler follows Heaven, bending the people to exalt the ruler, bending the ruler to respect Heaven – this is the great meaning of the *Spring and Autumn Annals* (春秋)." Confucius' (孔子) writing of the *Spring and Autumn Annals* (春秋) was done for nothing more than establishing the roles of ruler and father. When he wrote the *Classic of Filial Piety* (孝經), he also heavily favored the side of the ruler and parent, saying, "Filial piety begins with serving one's parents, is central in serving one's ruler, and culminates in establishing oneself." Thus, he sought to regulate all hundred human conducts with the single matter of filial piety. And Confucius' (孔子) intention was exactly the same as Hsun Ch'ing's (荀卿). Hsun Tzu's (荀子) chapter on the Five Punishments (五刑章) states, "He who coerces his ruler has no regard for superiors; he who negates the sages has no regard for the law; he who is unfilial has no regard for his parents. This is the way of great chaos." The chapter on Widely Spreading Fame (廣揚名章) states, "Because the superior man serves his parents filially, his loyalty can be transferred to the ruler. Because he serves his elder brother fraternally, his obedience can be transferred to his elders. Because his household is well-ordered, his governance can be transferred to official duties." Thus, if we examine Confucius' (孔子) doctrines in detail, because he recognized filial piety as the root of all hundred conducts, there was no instance where his establishment of teachings did not take filial piety as the starting point. This can be known even by looking at the fact that the character for teaching (敎) in "establishing teachings" (立敎) is derived from the character for filial piety (孝). That is, when a person is at home, being filial means serving one's parents; when one holds office and is at court, being filial means serving one's ruler. If one transfers the way of serving parents to serving the ruler and also serving elders, one can become a loyal and obedient person, thereby making one's name renowned in the world. However, while this filial piety, fraternity, loyalty, and obedience (孝悌忠順) may be beneficial to the class of the honored, noble, and senior, they are not beneficial to the class of the base and mean. Therefore, even if one encourages with fame and honor (名譽) and entices with salaries and positions (祿位), ultimately, the feeling of inequality towards the honored, noble, and senior cannot be absent. Thus, even though Shun (舜) governed the empire with filial piety and obtained two daughters [as wives], Sao Fu (巢父) and Hsü Yu (許由) regarded him with disdain. Even though Confucius (孔子) said he could not abolish the righteousness between ruler and minister, the Old Man Carrying a Basket on a Pole (荷蓧丈人) mocked him as one who did not exert his four limbs and could not distinguish the five grains, seeing Confucius as nothing more than a vagrant.
In essence, Confucianism views the family and the state as identical, and the ruler and the father as identical. It treats the family as a kind of feudal domain, designates the father (head of the family - 家君) as the lord of that place, and the ruler who presides over it is like the monarch. The monarch established the marvelous teaching plan called "Filial Piety" (孝) to ensure ten thousand years for the royal house. The scope of filial piety became wider and wider, so looking at what is said in the so-called *Ta Tai Chi* (大載記), "To be undignified in dwelling and demeanor is unfilial; to be disloyal in serving the ruler is unfilial; to be disrespectful in presiding over office is unfilial; to be faithless among friends is unfilial; to lack courage on the battlefield is unfilial." Thus, filial piety truly encompasses everything. Consequently, the family system and autocratic politics finally stuck together like glutinous rice cake, opening the way for the dictatorship of the privileged class. The words of Yu Tzu (有子), "Filial piety and fraternal submission are the root of becoming human. It is unlikely that anyone who is filial and fraternal <15> would like offending their superiors, and there has never been one who does not like offending superiors who likes causing rebellion," well explain the circumstances. Some commentators might argue, "The loyalty and filial piety of Confucianism are not unilateral duties borne only by those below; those above also share certain mutual obligations," and offer as examples phrases like "The father is kind, the son is filial (父慈子孝); the ruler employs the minister with propriety, the minister serves the ruler with loyalty (君使臣以禮, 臣事君以忠)." However, this is not so. That is, if a father is not kind, there is no sanction against him, but if a son is unfilial to his father, he is subjected to the most severe article of the Five Punishments. If a ruler is discourteous to his minister, there is no sanction against him, but if a minister is disloyal to his ruler, he will immediately receive legal punishment. The relationships between brothers, elders and juniors, and husband and wife are all like this. Ultimately, the poisonous harm that the autocratic thought emerging centered on Confucian filial piety has inflicted on human development is certainly no less than that of floods and wild beasts.
In the *Robber Chih* (盜跖便) chapter of *Chuang Tzu* (莊子), Confucius (孔丘) is directly denounced as "the crafty hypocrite of Lu (魯)," and it also says, "Waggling your hips and wagging your tongue, arbitrarily creating right and wrong to confuse the rulers of the world, causing the scholars of the world not to return to their roots, falsely fabricating filial piety and fraternal duty to luckily seek enfeoffment as lords and riches and nobility (搖臀鼓舌, 擅生是非, 以迷天下之主, 使天下學士不反其本, 妄作孝悌而儌幸於封侯富貴)." It rebukes seeking worldly gain by borrowing filial piety and fraternity. Truly, it does not fail to be a pointed statement hitting the mark (一針見血).
Then, if someone were perhaps to ask, "If you discard Confucius' (孔氏) meaning of filial piety and fraternity like that, what do you intend to replace it with?" I would immediately answer, Lao Tzu (老子) said, "When the six kinship relations are not harmonious, there are filial piety and kindness (六親不和有孝慈)." If the six kinship relations were harmonious, what use would there be for filial piety and kindness? Therefore, I would replace filial piety and fraternity with the character "Harmony" (和). This has no discriminating view whatsoever and at the same time is extremely congruent with human righteousness.

Rites: Confucius can be called the Eternal Exemplar of the Bureaucratic Faction
Lao Tzu (老子) said, "Superior virtue is not virtuous, therefore it has virtue. Inferior virtue never deviates from virtue, therefore it has no virtue. Superior virtue is non-active (無爲) and has no use for acting. Inferior virtue acts and has use for acting. Superior benevolence (仁) acts and has no use for acting. Superior righteousness (義) acts and has use for acting. Superior rites (禮) act, and when no one responds, rolls up its sleeves and forces them. Therefore, when the Way (道) is lost, then comes virtue (德); when virtue is lost, then comes benevolence; when benevolence is lost, then comes righteousness; <16> when righteousness is lost, then comes rites. Rites are the thinning of loyalty (忠) and trustworthiness (信) and the beginning of chaos (亂)." Wen Tzu (文子) said, "Those who practice rites carve and polish human nature, twisting and distorting its feelings. Though the eyes desire, they are forbidden by standards; though the heart delights, it is restrained by rites. Hurrying, circling, bending joints, bowing humbly, meat congeals uneaten, wine foams undrunk. Externally, they bind their forms; internally, they distress their virtue. They lock up the harmony of yin and yang and oppress the feelings of life and destiny. Therefore, they are sorrowful people their whole lives, none able to complete their natural lifespan." He also said, "Following nature and acting is called the Way (道); attaining one's heavenly nature is called virtue (德). Only after nature is lost are benevolence and righteousness (仁義) valued. When benevolence and righteousness are established, the Way and virtue are abolished. When simple purity is scattered, rites and music (禮樂) are adorned. Now, rites are that by which the noble and base, the exalted and mean are distinguished (所以別尊卑貴賤也). When rites and music are adorned, hypocrisy is born." Generally, the Taoist school valued the Way and Virtue (道德), while the Confucian school mainly focused on Benevolence and Righteousness (仁義). Mencius (孟子) exclusively esteemed Benevolence and Righteousness and did not reach the Way and Virtue. After him, people like Hsun Ch'ing (荀卿) tried to base everything on Rites (禮). Therefore, his disciples like Li Ssu (李斯) and Han Fei (韓非) exclusively esteemed technique and knowledge (知術) and exclusively employed law, leading the calamity of Eastern despotism to reach its extreme therein. Furthermore, among the discussions on these Rites, the words of Su Ming-yün (蘇明允) are most exquisite. He said:
"That person called a sage necessarily drives the people of the world to bow down (屈拜) to their ruler, their minister, their father, and their elder brother solely for the purpose of creating a single authority. Even if he is my elder brother, father, or ruler, if I were to embrace him, stand with him, and associate with him as an equal, I would not feel the slightest sense of difference towards him. At the same time, if I once became angry, I could insult and strike him without feeling the least bit of unease. The person called a sage had a clever idea here: let the ruler, father, and elder brother sit quietly and comfortably, while making those who are ministers, sons, and younger brothers all stand below them and bow. Even if there is anger towards them, the usual feelings of reverence and bowing are triggered, and they dare not do anything. This can be known even through the example that if we carve a wooden puppet (木偶人) and bow to it morning and evening, afterwards we can absolutely not chop that wood to make a fire. In this way, those who are rulers, fathers, and elder brothers have also been able to rest comfortably in their high positions up to the present day."
Thus he spoke. Generally, the fundamental meaning of Rites is such, and the function of Rites is also such. <17>
In essence, it is only too natural that the Confucian school, which values status distinctions (名分) and emphasizes hierarchy (等差), should venerate "Rites" (禮), the unique expression of its spirit. And it is a matter of course that Mr. K'ung (孔氏), the founder of the Confucian school, would also be the master of Rites. Is not the statement in the *Appended Phrases* (繫辭) of the *Book of Changes* (周易), "Heaven is high, Earth is low – thus Ch'ien and K'un are determined. With low and high set forth, the positions of the noble and base are established (天尊地卑乾坤定矣, 卑高以陳貴賤位矣)," or the statement in the *Doctrine of the Mean* (中庸), "The gradations in affection for relatives and the ranks of the noble and base are what give rise to rites (親親之殺, 尊卑之等禮所生也)," conveying this news?
According to tradition, Mr. K'ung (孔氏) inquired about Rites from Lao Tzu (老子). At that time, Lao Tzu connected the past and present, understood the great source of Rites and Music (禮樂), and had attained the destination of the Way and Virtue (道德). Having heard his explanation, Mr. K'ung should rightfully have had some enlightenment. Yet why did he betray his original teacher, abandon the Way and Virtue, venerate Benevolence and Righteousness (仁義), and lean heavily towards Rites? Thus, he devoted himself to seeking office (干祿), was eager to participate in government (從政), and even if without a ruler for just three months, he would become restless and agitated (栖栖皇皇), comparing himself to a gourd hanging uselessly. It reached the point where he bowed low to Nan Tzu (南子) and intended to go to Fo [*possibly referring to Pi Hsi 佛肸, a rebellious official*], seeking favor from as many as 72 rulers. Yet he did not know his own sycophancy, saying, "The ruler employs the minister according to ritual propriety (君使臣以禮)," and also, "Governing a state requires rites and yielding (禮讓爲國)." Why was he busy keeping up with the times and flattering the world (趨時阿世)? For several thousand years, Confucians have considered themselves a state of propriety and righteousness (禮義之邦), flowing along without knowing how to return. Is this not a truly pathetic state of affairs?
While on the subject, let me add a few words about Mr. K'ung (孔氏). Mr. K'ung originally grew up in a bureaucratic family in Lu (魯). From childhood, he was preoccupied with minor official posts (斗宵小官). By the time he set his mind on learning and inquired about Rites from Lao Tzu, [Lao Tzu said] "the man and his bones have all decayed (人與骨皆朽)." When he was much older, under the banner of "Revere the Chou, Expel the Barbarians" (尊周攘夷), he meticulously planned to establish himself and conduct himself in the world. People with lofty character like Chü Ni (沮溺) all regarded him as dirty. He himself came to make the brazen remark, "I serve my prince according to the full rules of propriety; people think it is flattery (事君盡禮, 人以爲謟)." From this, one can glimpse how strongly the contemporary evaluation of Mr. K'ung's (孔氏) flattery (謟佞) prevailed. Especially if one looks at records like the *Hsiang Tang* (鄕黨) chapter of the *Analects* (論語), written by Mr. K'ung's disciples, Mr. K'ung's attitude towards the noble/base, exalted/mean, and his various ways of bowing and scraping (鞠躬噈踖) were truly indescribable. Someone like Mr. K'ung can indeed be called the eternal exemplar (萬世師表) of the bureaucratic faction in the age of despotism. <18>
The above is excerpted from Mr. O U's (吳虞氏) critique of Confucian thought. Of course, in his hatred for class despotism, the core of Confucian thought, Mr. O's words may perhaps have flowed into excessive vehemence, but in my thinking, there seem to be generally no major errors.
There is no need to repeat, but the thought of Confucianism is sordidly constituted by the concepts of status distinction (名分) and hierarchy (等差). Look at the so-called Three Bonds (三綱): Ruler is the guide of the minister (君爲臣綱), Father is the guide of the son (父爲子綱), Husband is the guide of the wife (夫爲妻綱). Or look at the Five Relationships (五倫): Affection between father and son (父子有親), Righteousness between ruler and minister (君臣有義), Distinction between husband and wife (夫婦有別), Order between elder and younger (長幼有序), Trust between friends (朋友有信). How consistently they are permeated by the opposition of high/low (上下), noble/base (尊卑), exalted/mean (貴賤)! That is, ruler and minister are thus, father and son are thus, husband and wife, elder and younger are thus. Only in the single phrase "Trust between friends" is the opposition between human and human barely acknowledged. Indeed, what a shallow and tenacious logic it is.
Where did this kind of Confucian thought generally come from? Regarding this, observations might differ depending on the person, but as I see it, that Confucian thought seems to be nothing more than something fabricated through the writings of the Duke of Chou (周公) and Confucius (孔子), having gotten hints (1) from where primitive Cǎo​mèi people (草眛人 - people in a primitive, ignorant state) felt palpitations upon seeing the forms of the natural world, and (2) from the Might-is-Right thought (Power of the father, Power of the male, Power of seniority - 父權男權齒權) of the so-called age of chieftain omnipotence, which transitioned from a matrilineal to a patrilineal system. Statements like "Heaven is high, Earth is low" (天尊地卑) or "Succeeding Heaven to establish the ultimate standard" (繼天立極) are purely statements that recognize the hierarchy of the human world through awe towards the natural world. Things like the family system or filial piety are nothing more than recognizing and approving the patriarchal system of the chieftain era as it was. Things like Filial Piety, Fraternity, Loyalty, Trustworthiness (孝悌忠信) or Rites, Music, Punishment, Administration (禮樂刑政) are nothing more than the writings pieced together this way and that by the Duke of Chou and Confucius.
Generally, in the ancient past of the East (though perhaps not only the East), the one major problem of human society was not, like today, the problem of rich and poor, but solely the disorder arising from the contention of power against power (力與力之拮据). From the perspective of people at that time, if only that could be put in order, it seemed the world would be at peace. In fact, it was so. In that era of vast lands and sparse population (地廣人稀), and also extremely low living standards, it is only too clear that if only order could be maintained, there would be no further problems. Therefore, at that time, the so-called people who concerned themselves with the ways of the world and human affairs (世道人間) thought of only <19> one thing. That was, how to make each person content in their status (分) and obedient to their fate (命), so as not to cause rebellion (悖亂). Politics was this, and morality was also this. The deeds of sage-kings were this, and the intentions of philosophers were also this. Beyond that, how to increase production more, share culture, and raise the general standard of living by another level was not the issue. The general public also did not desire that. There is a saying passed down from *old times* among us: "Can people live without laws (법)?" This "cannot live" does not mean something else; it solely means one cannot live because it is chaotic (紊亂).
One cannot live in chaos. There must at least be a method to prevent chaos. Then what should be done? The common multitude (衆人) most fears the mysteries of the natural world. They fear the constraints of power (力). And they are beings who cannot overcome the force of habit (習慣). Thereupon, the factions who were quicker-witted and seized power first established the Three Bonds and Five Relationships (三綱五倫) and instituted Rites, Music, Punishment, and Administration (禮樂刑政) under the fine-sounding name of "Acting Heaven's Way" (體天行道). They decided to maintain the order of the larger situation under a system where the father controls the son, the elder brother the younger brother, the husband the wife, the elder the younger, the wise the foolish, the scholar-official the commoner, and the ruler the minister. Thus, doing this was called law (法), the Way (道), and the Cardinal Guides and Constant Relationships (倫綱), and the general public was anesthetized to it, so the masses themselves took charge of its protection and maintenance. This is the true essence (眞諦) of Confucian thought. However, what about today? It goes without saying that this thought is unacceptable from the standpoint of recent liberalism (which denies human individuality). Most importantly, today's economic relations do not permit the support of this thought. Look! First of all, even that family system, which was the crystallization (結晶體) of Confucian thought, is being destroyed day by day due to the livelihood difficulties arising as a result of the current economic structure. Simultaneously, the Cardinal Guides like Father is the guide of the son (父爲子綱) and Husband is the guide of the wife (夫爲妻綱) fundamentally lose the ground where they can be applied. Besides that, regarding things like Distinction between husband and wife (夫婦有別), on one hand, there is a class that is too rich, setting up private brothels (私設遊廓), and on the other hand, there is a class that is too poor, demanding public brothels (公設遊廓). Whether one has or has not, they mutually create a state of *promiscuity* (*婚狀態 - likely a typo or obscure term, possibly meaning亂婚乱婚 - promiscuous marriage/relations*). Thus, looking at it this way or that, it can be said that the current situation is one where Confucian thought is suffering total destruction. <20>

**Summary**

This article vehemently critiques Confucianism, arguing its core tenets—hierarchy (high/low, noble/base, exalted/mean), the Three Bonds and Five Relationships, filial piety, and rites—are instruments designed to maintain autocratic control and social stagnation. Quoting Chinese critic O U (Wu Yu), the author asserts that Confucianism, particularly its emphasis on filial piety, served primarily to uphold the power of rulers and fathers, suppressing individual rights and preventing social progress. The author contends that this ideology, which has deeply permeated Korean society for centuries, is now incompatible with modern economic realities and liberal values, pointing to the breakdown of the traditional family structure as evidence of Confucianism's inevitable demise. Historically, this piece is significant as it showcases the intense anti-Confucian sentiment among some Korean intellectuals during the colonial period, who identified traditional thought systems as obstacles to modernization and national strength. The explicit reference to and extensive quotation of a contemporary Chinese intellectual criticizes Confucianism reflects the shared discourse and intellectual exchange occurring across East Asia concerning tradition and modernity in the face of external pressures and internal calls for reform.

上下·尊卑·貴賤, 이것이 儒家思想의 基礎觀念이다
						起瀍 抄
실로 말이다나. 나는 儒敎에 대한 생각을 하게 되면, 엇더케 마음이 갑갑하고, 아니꼽고, 불쾌해서 견댈 수가 업다. 三綱이니 五倫이니 하야, 사람과 사람의 새를 지독하게도 尊卑, 上下, 貴賤의 관계로써 억매여 노코, 다시 禮樂刑政으로써 그것의 실행을 보장하야, 天下後世의 민중으로 하여금, 그 밧게 한 거름을 버서나지 못하게 한 그 經緯를 생각하면, 실로 可憎可憎한 일이다. 더욱히 우리 朝鮮 사람이 累百年來에 그놈의 사상에 저리우고 또 저리워서, 目下 당장에 생활의 파멸을 당하는 이 지경에도, 그 사상상의 속박에서 까지 뛰여 나지 못하는 생각을 하면, 즉 사상혁명까지 주저하는 생각을 하면, 누구가 이에 대한 증오를 금할 者이랴. 이것은 필자 1인의 편견이 아니라, 이 儒敎思想의 出源處되는 中國 학자들의 견해도 同然하니, 이제 中國思想界의 巨星인 吳虞氏의 儒敎思想에 대한 비판을 摘記하면,

孝 이것이 專制主義의 唯一한 根據
鉤命決에 孔子의 말을 記綠하얏스니 가로되 「내의 뜻은 春秋에 잇고 行은 孝經에 잇다」하얏고, 孟子는 가로되 「世衰道微하고 邪說이 暴行하야, 臣이 其君을 弑하는 者 잇고 子-其父를 弑하는 者-잇슬새, 孔子-懼하야 春秋를 지엿다」하얏고, 董仲舒는 가로되 「孔子-得失을 밝히고 貴賤을 난운 것은 王道에 도라오게 한 근본책이니, 고로 以而人隨君,＜14＞ 以君隨天, 屈民伸君, 屈君而仲天은 春秋의 大義라」한 바, 孔子가 春秋를 지은 것은 이와 가티 君父의 分을 세우기 위함에서 지내지 못한 것이며, 그가 孝經을 지음에도 또한 君親의 편에 편중하야, 가로되 孝는 事親에 始하고 事君에 中하고 立身에 終한다하야, 사람의 百行을 孝의 一事로써 규율하라하엿스며, 그리고 孔子의 뜻은 荀卿의 뜻과 꼭 가튼대, 荀子의 五刑章에는 가로되 「要君者無上, 非聖人者無法, 非孝者無親, 此大亂之道」라 하고, 廣揚名章에는 가로되 「君子之事親孝故忠可移於君, 事兄悌故順可移於長, 居家理故治可移於官」이라 한 등, 孔子의 학설을 詳考하면, 일즉히 孝를 百行의 本으로 認한 故로 其立敎가 모다 孝로써 起點을 삼지 안음이 업스니, 立敎의 敎字가 孝字로 從生한 것을 볼지라도 可知할 바이다. 즉 사람이 집에 잇슬 때에는 事親으로써 효를 삼고, 벼슬해서 朝廷에 잇슬 때에는 事君으로써 孝를 삼으되, 事親의 道를 옴기여써 君을 事하고 또 長을 事하면 능히 忠順한 사람이 되야, 가히 其名을 세상에 揚하리라 하얏다. 그러나 이 孝悌忠順은 다-가티 尊貴長上의 級에는 利가 될지연뎡 卑賤의 級에는 利치 못한 것인즉, 비록 「名譽로써 獎하고 祿位로써 誘할지라도 결국 尊貴長上에 대한 불평등의 感이 업지 못할 것이다. 고로 舜이 孝로써 천하를 芇�하야 2女를 獲하엿슬지라도, 巢父, 許由는 그를 不屑히 녁엿스며, 孔子가 君臣의 義를 廢치 못해서 그러노라 할지라도 荷蓧丈人은 그로써 四軆를 不勤하고 五穀을 不分하는 者라고 譏嘲하야 孔子를 한 개의 遊民으로 밧게는 더 보지 안하섯다.
요컨대 儒敎에서는 家와 國을 동일한 것으로 보고, 君과 父를 동일한 것으로보되, 家로써 일종의 封建城域을 삼고, 父(家君)로 그곳의 城主를 명하고, 그 우에 군림하는 것이 가튼 君主이엿스며, 君主는 「孝」라 하는 기묘한 敎案을 세워서, 王家의 億萬歲를 期하니, 孝의 범위는 더욱더욱히 널버저서, 소위 大載記에 말한 바로써 보면 「居處不莊非孝也, 事君不忠非孝也, 莅官不敬非孝也, 朋友無信非孝也, 戰陣無勇非孝也」라 한바, 孝의 그것은 실로 무엇이나 포함되지 안음이 업다. 그래서 가족제도와 전제정치란 것은 드대여 찰떡가티 딱 부터서, 드대여 특권계급 專制의 길을 열엇스니, 有子의 말에 「孝悌는 사람되는 근본이라, 누구나 孝悌하는 사람으로 犯上하기를 됴와할 리가＜15＞ 업스며, 犯上하기를 됴와하지 안는 사람으로 怍亂을 됴와할 자가 업스리라」한 말이, 잘 그간의 經緯를 설명한 것이다할 것이다. 論者 중 혹은, 「儒家의 忠孝는 오즉 在下者가 부담하는 片務의 義務가 아니요 在上者-역시 엇던 의무를 분담하는 雙務의 것이라』하며 그 예로써 「父慈子孝, 君使臣以禮, 臣事君以忠」의 문구를 주어올넌지는 모르나, 그러나 그것은 그러치 아니하니, 즉 父가 되야 慈치 아느면 거긔예 대하야는 하등의 制裁가 업스나, 子가 되야 父에게 불효하면 五刑의 最重條에 처하게 되며, 君이 되야 臣에게 무례하는 데에는 하등의 制裁가 업스나 臣이 되야 君에게 不忠하면 당장에 律治를 바들 것이며, 兄弟, 長幼, 夫妻에 대한 것이 모도가 그러한 즉, 결국 儒敎의 孝를 중심잡아나온 專制思想의 인문발달에 준 害毒은 결코 洪水 猛獸에서 못지 안흘 것이다.
莊子盜跖便에서 孔丘를 直斥하되 「魯의 巧僞人」이라하고, 또 가로되 「搖臀鼓舌, 擅生是非, 以迷天下之主, 使天下學士不反其本, 妄作孝悌而儌幸於封侯富貴라」하야, 孝悌를 비러써 세간에 苟苟한 것을 叱責하얏나니 실로 一針見血의 至言됨을 不失한다.
그러면 혹이나 다려 「네가 그와 가치 孔氏의 孝悌의 義를 抛棄하면 다시 무엇으로써 대할 생각이냐」하면 나는 곳 대답하되, 老子의 말에 「六親不和有孝慈」라 하엿나니, 만일 六親이 苟和하면 孝慈라는 것이 무엇에 쓰는 것일가, 고로 나는 孝悌의 代에 「和」字로써 할지니, 이것은 하등 분별의 見이 업는 것인 동시에 극히 人間義에 합할 것이라 한다.

禮孔子는 可謂官僚派之萬世師表
老子는 가로되 「上德不德是以有德, 下德不失德是以無德, 上德無爲而無以爲, 下德爲之而有以爲, 上仁爲之而無以爲, 上義爲之而有以爲, 上禮爲之而莫之應則攘臂而仍之, 故失道而後德, 失德而後仁, 失仁而後義＜16＞失義而後禮, 禮者忠信之薄而亂之首也」라 하고, 文子는 가로되 「爲禮者雕琢人性, 矯拂其情, 目雖欲之禁以度, 心雖樂之節以禮, 趨翔周旋, 屈節卑拜, 肉凝而不食, 酒激而不飮, 外束其形, 內愁其德, 鈅陰陽之和而迫性命之情, 故, 終身哀人, 莫能終其天年」이라하고, 또 가로되 「循性而行謂之道, 得其天性謂之德, 性失然後貴仁義, 仁義立而道德廢, 純樸散而禮樂飾, 夫禮者, 所以別尊卑貴賤也, 禮樂飾而虛僞生」이라하얏다. 大盖道家에서는 道德을 貴해하엿고, 儒家에서는 仁義를 主로 하엿는대, 孟子는 仁義를 專尙하야 道德에 밋지 못하엿스며, 그 다음의, 荀卿가튼 사람은 一切를 禮에 基本하려 하엿슴으로 그의 門人 李斯, 韓非와 가튼 사람은 知術을 專尙하야 법을 專用한 바, 東方專制의 禍가 거긔에서 極하엿다. 또 이 禮에 대한 논의 중에 蘇明允의 말가튼 것은 가장 절묘하니, 가로되
「뎌 聖人이란 사람이 반다시 천하의 사람을 모라 그 君과 그 臣과 그 父 그 兄에게 屈拜케 한 것은 오즉 한가지 권위를 지으려 하는 데에 잇나니, 저가 비록 내 형이요 父이요 또 君이라 할지라도 내가 그와 가티, 더브러 안고 더부러 서고, 더부러 동무할 것 가트면, 내가 조곰이라도 그에 대한 異感을 가지지 못하는 동시에, 내가 한 번 성내면, 곳 그를 욕하고 때리면서도 죠곰도 불안을 늣기지 아니할 것이라. 聖人이란 사람이 여기에 한 꽤가 나서, 君, 父, 兄이란 사람은 가만히 안께하고 편하게 하고, 臣, 子, 弟라는 者는 다-그 밋헤 서게 하고 절하게 하야, 비록 그에 대한 분노가 잇슬지라도, 평소에 공경하고 절하던 심정이 발작되야, 감히 엇지하지를 못하나니, 이것은 우리가 木偶人을 하나 깍가노코, 거긔에 朝夕으로 졀을 하고 보면, 그 후에는 도저히 그 나무를 패여써 불을 때일 수가 업게 되는 一例로써 불지라도 可知할 바라. 이러케 하야, 君, 父, 兄되는 사람도 능히 그 놉흔 자리에 편안하야써 今日에 至하얏다」
하얏스니, 대개 禮의 根本義가 그러하며 禮의 작용이 또 그러한 것이다.＜17＞
요컨대 명분을 貴해하고 等差를 重히 녀기는 儒家에서 그 정신의 유일한 표현인 「禮」를 尊崇할 것은 너무나 당연한 일이오, 儒家의 本宗되는 孔氏가 역시 禮의 都家가 될 것은 물론이라. 周易*辭에 「天尊地卑乾坤定矣, 卑高以陳貴賤位矣」라 한 말이나 中庸에 「親親之殺, 尊卑之等禮所生也」라 한 말이 모다 이 소식을 전하는 것이 아닌가.
傳에 의하면 孔氏는 禮를 老子에게 무럿다. 당시의 老子는 古今을 전달하야, 禮樂의 大原을 통하고, 道德의 귀추를 達하엿슨즉, 그의 설명을 드른 孔氏는 맛당히 다소의 깨달음이 잇섯슬 것이여늘, 엇지하야 그는 本師를 背하고, 道德을 舍하며 仁義를 崇하고, 禮에 편중하엿는가, 그래서 干祿에 專心하고 從政에 급급하야, 석달만 人君이 업슬지라도 栖栖皇皇하야, 스사로 瓠瓜에 비기며, 심하야는 南子에게 下拜하고 佛*에게 나가려 하야, 干求한 바가 72君의 多에 至하되, 스사로 苟苟한 줄을 모르고, 曰 「君使臣以禮」이니, 又曰 「禮讓爲國」이니 하야, 趨時阿世에 분주하얏는고, 몃 천년내에 儒者는 스사로 예의의 邦으로 처하야, 흘너 도라 올줄을 모르니, 엇지 한심한 일이 아니리요.
말이 난김에 孔氏의 일에 대하야 數言을 加記하면, 孔氏는 本히 魯의 官僚家에 生長하야, 幼少時로부터 斗宵小官에 급급하고, 밋 其學에 뜻을 두어 禮를 老子에게 무를 때에는 벌서 「人與骨이 皆朽」하얏스며, 훨신 長城함에 밋처는 尊周攘夷의 표방하에서, 구구히 立身行世를 圖하야, 沮溺과 가튼 고결한 인격을 가진 사람은 모다 그를 더러히 녁혀스며, 자기 亦 「事君盡禮, 人以爲謟」이란 放言을 하게 된 것을 보면, 孔氏의 謟佞에 대한 당시의 평이 여하히 甚行하엿는가를 엿볼 수가 잇스며, 특히 孔氏의 門人에게서 일너진 「論語「의 鄕黨篇의 기록가튼 것을 보면, 孔氏의 尊卑貴賤에 대한 태도, 其鞠躬噈踖의 종종 모양이 실로 名狀할 수 업섯나니, 孔氏와 가튼 이는 가히 專制時代 官僚派의 萬世師表라 할만하도다.＜18＞
右는 吳虞氏의 儒敎思想을 논평한 중에서 抄記한 것이다. 물론 吳氏는 儒敎思想의 骨子되는 階級專制 그것을 미워하는 서슬에, *그 말한바가 혹 矯激에 흘넌 넌지는 모르나, 내의 생각으로는 대체로 큰 과오는 업는 듯 십다.
거듭 말할 것은 업는 일이거니와, 儒敎의 사상은 齷齪하게도 名分, 等差의 관념으로 구성되엿다, 소위 君爲臣綱 父爲子綱, 夫爲妻綱이라는 三綱에서 보아라, 또는 父子有親, 君臣有義, 夫婦有別, 長幼有序, 朋友有信이라는 五倫에서 보아라, 얼마나 上下, 尊卑, 貴賤의 대립으로써 일관되엿느냐, 즉 君, 臣이 그러하고 父, 子가 그러하고 夫婦 長幼가 그러하고 간신히 朋友有信이란 한 구에서 인간과 인간의 대립을 認하엿슬 뿐이다. 과연 얼마나 천박, 악착한 논리이냐.
儒敎의 이러한 사상이 대체 어대로부터 온것이냐, 이에 잇서는,  사람에 따라 그 관찰이 다를넌지 모로나, 나로써 보건대, 儒敎의 그 사상은 (1) 원시시대의 草眛人이 자연계의 形狀을 보고 動悸를 느끼는 거긔에서 (2) 또는 母系로부터 父系에 移한, 소위 酋長萬能時代의 力萬能(父權男權齒權)사상에서 힌트를 어더, (3) 周公, 孔子의 文章으로써 가공한 것에 지내지 못함과 갓다. 가튼 天尊地卑이니 繼天立極이니 하는 것은 純然히 자연계에 대한 驚異로써 인간계의 尊卑를 인정함에 지내지 못하는 말이며, 가튼 가족제도이니 효도이니 하는 것은 酋長時代의 가장제도를 그대로 認準함에 지내지 못한 것이며 가튼 孝悌忠信이니 禮樂刑政이니 하는 것은 周公孔子의 이리뎌러 맛추워 노은 文章에서 지내지 못하는 것이다.
대개 동양(반다시 동양 뿐도 아니겟지만)의 古昔에 잇서, 인간사회의 一大問題가 되던 것은, 오늘날과 가티, 貧富의 문제도 아니오, 오즉 力과 力의 拮据에서 생기는 무질서-그것이엿다. 그때의 사람으로 볼 때에는 그것만 정돈되면 천하태평일 것 가타섯다. 事實 그랫다. 地廣人稀하고 또 생활정도는 극히 低下하엿던 그때에 잇서, 질서하나만 유지되면, 다시 문제가 업슬 것은 너무나 분명한 일이다. 고로 그때에 잇서 소위 世道人間을 念한다는 사람으로 다못＜19＞ 한 가지 생각한 것은 그것이엿다. 즉 엇더케 하면 사람 사람이 各히 기분에 安하고 命에 順하야 悖亂을 니르키지 아흘고 하는 그것이엿다. 此 정치가 그것이요 도덕이 亦 그것이엿다. 聖君의 作事도 즉 그것이요 哲人의 用心이 亦 그것이엿다. 그 밧게 엇더케 하면 더 생산을 느리고 문화를 나위여 일반의 생활정도를 한층 놉혀 볼가 하는 것은 문제가 아니엿다. 또 일반도 그것을 원하지 아니하엿다. *로부터 오는 우리의 말에 「법이 업스면 사람이 살수가 잇나?」하는 말이 잇나니, 이 살 수가 업다는 것은 다른 의미의 말이 아니오, 오즉 紊亂해서 못 산다는 의미이다.
紊亂해서는 못산다, 젹어도 紊亂치 못하게 하는 방법은 잇서야 한다. 그러면 엇더케 할가. 천천衆人은 제일 자연계의 신비를 경외한다. 力의 制裁를 두려워한다. 그리고 습관의 세력에 못겐디는 者들이다. 이에써 누구보다도 몬저 꾀가 나고 몬저 세력을 잡은 축들은 자칭 軆天行道의 美名 밋헤서 三綱五倫을 정하고 禮樂刑政을 버플어, 父는 子를, 兄은 弟를, 夫는 妻를, 長은 幼를, 賢은 愚를, 士는 庶人을, 君은 臣을 통솔견제하는 밋헤서 大局의 질서를 유지키로 하엿다. 그래서 이리하는 것을 법이라 하고 道라 하고 倫綱이라 하야 일반에게 마취케 한 바, 人衆은 스사로 스사로 그것의 護持에 당하엿다. 이것이 儒敎思想의 眞諦이다. 그러나 오늘에 잇서는 엇던가, 이 사상이 (인간의 개성을 부인하는) 근래의 自由主義의 견지로 보아, 어대까지 용인치 못할 것임은 물론이요, 제일 오늘의 경제관계가 이 사상의 지지를 許하지안는다. 보아라. 맨 첫재로 儒敎思想의 結晶軆이던 가족제도라는 그것도 現경제조직의 결과로 생기는 생활곤란으로 인하야 나날이 파멸되는 동시에 父爲子綱, 夫爲妻綱의 倫綱도 근본적으로 施用될 땅이 업게 되며, 그외의 夫婦有別가튼 것도 이 한편에는 너무 富한 계급이 잇서 私設遊廓을 장만하고 뎌 한편에는 너무 貧한 계급이 잇서 公設遊廓을 요구하기에 니르러, 잇는 者 업는 할것업서, 서로 서로 *婚狀態를 이루는 중인즉, 이러케 보나 뎌러케 보나 儒敎의 사상은 전적으로 파멸을 당하는 것이 오늘의 형편이라 하겟다.＜20＞
