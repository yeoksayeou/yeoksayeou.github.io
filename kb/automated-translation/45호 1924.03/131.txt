**Summary**

This is a company announcement from the magazine *Kaebyŏk* (開闢) regarding the establishment of a new branch office in Wŏnsan (元山). It details the branch's location, its jurisdictional area covering Wŏnsan Prefecture and four surrounding counties (Anbyŏn, Tŏkwŏn, Munch'ŏn, Kowŏn) in Hamgyŏngnam Province, and lists the branch manager, general affairs/reporter, and advisors. From a historical perspective, this announcement is significant as it demonstrates the organizational expansion and growing influence of *Kaebyŏk*, a major Korean cultural and nationalist magazine, during the Japanese colonial period. Establishing a regional branch, particularly in an important port city like Wŏnsan, indicates the magazine's efforts to broaden its readership and distribution network across the Korean peninsula, reflecting its ambition and reach despite the challenging political environment.
