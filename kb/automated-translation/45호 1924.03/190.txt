**Summary**

This article provides a day-by-day chronicle of world and Korean events from January 23rd to February 20th, 1924. It covers international politics (e.g., British recognition of Soviet Russia, US-UK relations, Chinese instability, European treaties, Mexican revolution), domestic issues in various countries (e.g., Japanese politics, strikes in Britain and Norway, US presidential race), and specific events impacting Korea under Japanese rule. These include independence movement activities (attacks, arrests), colonial administration actions (sentence reductions benefiting some Koreans, suppression of publications like Kaebyŏk itself), social issues (farmers' protests, Hyŏngp'yŏng movement), and the aftermath of the Great Kanto Earthquake massacre of Koreans.

For historians, this article is valuable as a contemporary snapshot of the interconnectedness of global events and their impact on colonial Korea. It highlights the ongoing armed resistance by independence groups, the colonial government's methods of control (censorship, arrests, selective pardons), social tensions within Korea (land disputes, caste discrimination), and the significant international attention (or lack thereof) paid to Korean issues, particularly the muted references (likely due to censorship indicated by "00") to the Kanto massacre just months after it occurred, even as international bodies discussed reparations and treaties elsewhere. The juxtaposition of global power shifts (like Soviet recognition) with local Korean struggles (like farmer protests and independence fighter deaths) is particularly revealing.
