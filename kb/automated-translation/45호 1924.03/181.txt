Renovation of the Hamnam Branch Office

In order to urgently commence new activities throughout the Hamnam region, where the passion for reading is swelling day by day like a rising tide, we are renovating the interior of the already established "Hamnam Branch Office" and expanding all business affairs. We ask the various worthies within the province to provide double the previous affection and support.

**Summary**

This is a public announcement from the Kaebyŏk Company regarding the renovation, expansion, and relocation of its Hamnam (South Hamgyŏng Province) branch office in Hamhŭng. It lists the new address and the newly appointed staff (Branch Manager, General Affairs Manager, Reporter). The announcement cites the growing "passion for reading" in the region as the reason for expanding operations and asks for continued support from local influential figures. From a historical perspective, this brief notice highlights the efforts to disseminate information and foster intellectual activity through publishing during the colonial period, indicating a burgeoning readership and cultural engagement in provincial areas like Hamnam despite the restrictive environment. Historians might find the mention of increasing "reading fever" and the expansion of a prominent cultural magazine's branch operations significant evidence of cultural resilience and development.
