Lu School… Lu Xiangshan (陸象山)
Introduction (博幷書 - Broad Combined Writings?)
Lu Xiangshan's given name was Jiuyuan (九淵), and his courtesy name was Zijing (子靜); he was a native of Jinxi (金谿). Born in the second month of the 9th year of Shaoxing (紹興, 1139), from the age of three or four, his solemnity was like that of an adult. Whenever he encountered things, he would inquire about them. One day, he suddenly asked his father about the limits of heaven and earth. At the age of five, when he began reading, he read the words of Yichuan (伊川, Cheng Yi) and criticized them for not resembling the words of Confucius. Around the age of thirteen, while reading ancient texts, he came across the two characters for "universe" (宇宙) and interpreted them, saying, "Up, down, and the four directions are called 'yu' (宇), and the past, present, and future are called<51> 'zhou' (宙)." Suddenly, he had a great realization and said, "The universe is originally infinite; humans, heaven, earth, and all myriad things exist within this infinity." He also said, "The universe is precisely my mind; my mind is the universe. If a sage appears in the Eastern Sea, this mind is the same, this principle is the same. If a sage appears in the Western Sea, this mind is the same, this principle is the same. If a sage appears in the Southern Sea, this mind is the same, this principle is the same. If a sage appeared thousands or hundreds of years ago, this mind and this principle were the same. If a sage appears thousands or hundreds of years from now, this mind and this principle will be the same." It can be said that Xiangshan's learning was already established at this time. Later, seeing the barbarians' disorder in China, he profoundly held the great ambition to pacify the world and practiced archery and horsemanship. In his final years, he entered Guixi Mountain (貴溪山) to cultivate the Way. Because the shape of the mountain resembled an elephant (象), he named it Xiangshan. He passed away at the age of 54. In the 10th year of Jiading (嘉定, 1217), he was posthumously honored as Wen'an (文安). His writings are solely contained in the *Complete Works of Xiangshan* (象山全集).

School Lineage
Lu Xiangshan's learning is characterized by its extreme simplicity and directness. The origins and development of his scholarly style can be attributed to these three factors:
(1) Family Learning (家學) (2) The Spirit of the Times (時勢) (3) Reaction against the Zhu Xi (朱子) School.
His father and grandfather were both influenced by Mingdao's (明道, Cheng Hao) learning through Wang Zhenze (王震澤) and Xie Shangcai (謝上蔡).
Here, we wish to delve deeper and clearly contemplate Xiangshan's fundamental concept of "Mind is Principle" (心卽理). Pointing out only what Xiangshan inherited, it is as follows:
(1) Innate Goodness of Human Nature (性善) (2) Principle is All-Pervading (理는 遍滿) (3) Qi-Temperament (氣質).

(1) Innate Goodness of Human Nature (性善)
Xiangshan once told his students, "Your ears hear naturally, your eyes see clearly naturally, you are naturally able to be filial to your father and respectful to your elder brother. There is originally no deficiency; there is no need to seek elsewhere. It lies in establishing oneself." This refers to the innate goodness of human nature. He also said, "Human nature is originally good; that which is not good is due to being swayed by external things." Thus, if we seek the basis for his assertion of innate goodness, it is nothing other than that humans are born having received the 'mean' (中) of Heaven and Earth. Therefore, in a letter to Wang Shunbo (王順伯), he said, "Good people receive the mean of Heaven and Earth at birth; their original mind is without non-goodness."

(2) Principle is All-Pervading (理는 遍滿)
Xiangshan's conception of principle (理), like that of Cheng (程) and Zhu (朱), is nothing other than what is called "Heaven and Man are one貫." Therefore, in a short essay titled "On Learning" (以學文), he stated, "Within the universe, the evident constancy of norms, the resplendence of ethical relationships—where is there not this principle? The learning of scholars is indeed for the purpose of clarifying this principle." Also, in a letter to Wu Nandou (吳南斗), he said, "The universe is filled with just one principle. The ancient sages first awakened to this principle, hence when they ruled the world, they looked up to observe the phenomena of heaven, looked down to observe the patterns of the earth, observed the markings of birds and beasts and the suitability of the land, took examples from nearby in their own persons, and took examples from afar in external things." He also said, "Among the affairs and things of the world, there is only one principle, not two principles." There are extremely numerous similar statements, but due to lack of time to enumerate them one by one, they are omitted here.<52>

(3) Qi-Temperament (氣質)
Xiangshan originally did not adopt the theory of principle (理) and vital force (氣). However, he foresaw that there are differences in qi-temperament (氣質) such as thickness, thinness, strength, and weakness. He said, "Among those born, not all can be of the highest wisdom and without confusion. If the qi is partial or weak, the sense organs of the ears and eyes are obscured by external things without reflection." This is similar to Cheng, Zhu, and others. Then, how does his so-called qi-temperament differ from the theories of Cheng, Zhu, and others? At this point, we cannot avoid discussing his fundamental thought.

Philosophy
Mind (心)
Xiangshan thoroughly demolished the distinction between the human mind (人心) and the mind of the Way (道心) advocated by previous scholars, saying, "Mind is one; humans do not have two minds." The previous scholars who advocated the distinction between the human mind and the mind of the Way based it on the statement in the *Book of Documents* (書經): "The human mind is perilous; the mind of the Way is subtle." Regarding this, Xiangshan said, "Speaking from the perspective of the human, it is called 'perilous'; speaking from the perspective of the Way, it is called 'subtle'." He further explained the meaning of 'perilous' and 'subtle': "Thoughtlessness leads to madness, mastery of thought leads to sagehood—is this not perilous? Soundless and odorless, formless and bodiless—is this not subtle?" This means there is no distinction between the human mind and the mind of the Way; they are a single entity, merely appearing as two depending on the perspective of observation. This differs greatly from Mingdao (明道) and Shangcai (上蔡), let alone Yichuan (伊川) and Zhu Xi (朱子).
To divide heavenly principle (天理) and human desire (人欲) is to destroy the concept of the unity of Heaven and Man. Therefore, refuting this error, he said, "The argument dividing heavenly principle and human desire is extremely flawed. Since the *Book of Rites* (禮記) contained this statement, later people have followed it. The *Record* says, 'Man is born tranquil; this is the nature of Heaven. Moved by external things, activity arises; this is the desire of nature.' If this is so, then activity is also nature, and tranquility is also nature. How can there be a division between heavenly principle and material desire? If activity is not nature, then tranquility is also not nature. How can there be a distinction between activity and tranquility?" He identified heavenly principle with tranquility and human desire with activity. Thus, both activity and tranquility emerge from nature. If one is affirmed and the other denied, how can truth exist?
However, previous scholars all regarded heavenly principle as the mind of the Way and human artifice as the human mind. For Xiangshan, there was no distinction between the human mind and the mind of the Way, and no division between heavenly principle and human desire; there was only a single mind encompassing both activity and tranquility. If that is the case, what exactly is this so-called mind?

Mind is Principle (心卽理)
The Buddhist explanation of "seeing one's nature and attaining Buddhahood" and Xiangshan's explanation of the mind are quite similar. What is cited here best represents this concept. He said, "In the *Analects* (論語), there are many statements without a clear beginning or end, such as 'Knowledge reaches it, but benevolence cannot maintain it' (知及之 仁不能守之). It is unclear what is reached and what is maintained. Similarly, with 'To learn and constantly review it' (學而時習之), it is unclear what is constantly reviewed.<53> Without a fundamental grasp of learning, it is not easy to read. If one has a fundamental grasp, then what knowledge reaches is *this*, what benevolence maintains is *this*, what is constantly reviewed is *this*. Those who explain, explain *this*; those who take joy, take joy in *this*. It is like building a watershed on top of a tall house."
What Xiangshan calls "*this*" refers to *this mind*. Therefore, employing an ideal completely identical to that of the Chan (禪) school, he said, "The Way is just the Way. Even if one reaches the realm of a sage, it is still the Way before one's eyes." Thus, the mind is considered a single, supremely great entity, endowed with principle (理). Therefore, he said, "Righteous principle (義理) in the human mind is truly bestowed by Heaven and cannot be obliterated." Then, are righteous principle and the mind two different things? He answered, "No." Righteous principle is nothing but the pattern (檥式) of this mind. "It is what man inherently possesses, what minds universally share. Mind is Principle (心卽理)." That is all there is to say. However, this principle is the principle of nature. In following the principle of nature, how could there be a distinction between internal and external, surface and interior?
However, the differences between individuals arise from differences in qi-temperament (氣質). Although the mind seeks to operate according to its inherent laws, because the ears and eyes are constantly obscured by material desires, it cannot fully realize itself. Viewed this way, one can see how different this is from Zhu Xi.

Method of Cultivation (工夫論)
Meaning of Investigating Principle (窮理)
The meaning of investigating principle (窮理) was truly clarified starting with Xiangshan. This is because he held the doctrine that "Principle is Mind, Mind is One" (理卽心 心卽一矣). Therefore, Xiangshan considered that the so-called investigation of principle (窮理) and investigation of things (格物) are nothing more than cultivating one's own field. There is nothing to add to oneself; it is merely becoming conscious of what one inherently possesses. Therefore, he said, "I do not annotate the Six Classics (六經); the Six Classics are all commentaries on me." This is the difference between his school and others. He said, "What distinguishes my learning from others is simply that it lies entirely within me, with no fabrication. Though expressed in thousands or tens of thousands of words, it is just the realization of *that* which is within me; I have not added anything. Recently, someone criticized me, saying that apart from the phrase 'first establish the greater part' (先立乎其大者), I have no other skill. Hearing this, I said, 'Indeed, it is so.'"
However, to manifest the goodness of the mind, what is most important is, above all, to eliminate material desires. Therefore, he said, "Those who discuss learning today only focus on adding things from others. My approach is simply to diminish things from oneself. This is why we differ." The essential point of Xiangshan's cultivation method truly lies here. He also said, "To investigate things (格物) means to investigate *this*. Fuxi (伏羲), looking up at the phenomena and down at the patterns, also first exerted effort in *this*. Otherwise, the so-called investigation of things is merely secondary." *This* refers to the mind.

Reflection (思之)
Xiangshan said, "Establish yourself, value yourself; do not follow in others' footsteps or learn others' words." This single passage suffices to show the general character of his scholarly style.<54> However, if one does not follow others' footsteps or learn others' words, what should one do? He said, "Righteous principle (義理) in the human mind is truly bestowed by Heaven and cannot be obliterated. That it becomes obscured by external things, leading to violation of principle, is generally due to lack of reflection (弗思). If one can truly turn inward and reflect (反而思之), then regarding right and wrong, acceptance and rejection, there will be something that stirs implicitly, becomes distinctly clear, and is resolved without doubt." He also constantly taught his students, saying, "Each person is complete in themselves; what is essential is self-establishment (自立)."

Conclusion
In essence, Xiangshan's direct and simple scholarly style was a reaction to the trends and academic atmosphere of his time. His concept of "Mind is Principle" (心卽理) combined the investigation of principle (窮理) and practical application (實踐). The so-called investigation of principle and investigation of things meant nothing more than self-awareness of one's original mind. Accordingly, making one realize the greatness and importance of this original mind is the first gate to learning. However, after Xiangshan's death, there were two figures considered to have inherited his school's lineage: one was his disciple Yang Cihu (楊慈湖), and the other was Wang Yangming (王陽明) of the Ming dynasty.

Yang Cihu (楊慈湖)
Yang Cihu's given name was Jian (簡), and his courtesy name was Jingzhong (敬中). He died at the age of 86 and was posthumously honored as Wenyuan (文元). His writings include *Ji Yi* (己易), *Qi Bi* (啓蔽), and other works related to rites (禮).
Cihu further extended Xiangshan's concept of "Mind is Principle," stating that all laws are matters within one's own mind. His work *Ji Yi* posits that the operations of Heaven and Earth and the alternations of sun and moon mentioned in the *Book of Changes* (易) are all within one's own scope. Heaven and Earth are oneself; the changes of Heaven and Earth are one's own changes, not external things. Heaven is the phenomena (象) within my nature; Earth is the form (形) within my nature. Therefore, he said, "What forms phenomena in Heaven and what forms shapes on Earth are all my own doing." Thus, he was never constrained within the scope of Confucianism but leaped transcendently into the realm of Buddhism, saying, "I have not seen Heaven, Earth, and Man as three separate entities. The three are forms; the one is nature (性), which is the Way (道)." He also said, "The *Changes* (易) may have different names, but in reality, it is one body." One's own nature is the *Changes*; therefore, the so-called changing phenomena can all be sought herein. Thus, the statement "The *Changes* is on par with Heaven and Earth" (易與天地準) is not Confucius's word. "Heaven and Earth are the *Changes*; the hidden and the manifest are originally non-existent." For this reason, it is not necessary to know the reasons only after looking up and observing down. This clearly shows a mixture with Buddhist thought.
Others who transmitted Xiangshan's learning include Shu Guangping (舒廣平) and Suo Jiyuan (素繫淵). Guangping also studied under Zhang Nanxuan (張南軒), and Jiyuan visited Lü Donglai (呂東萊), but their learning generally followed Xiangshan. Jiyuan said, "Great indeed is the mind! It is fundamentally one with Heaven and Earth. If one obtains it through deep thought and preserves it through diligent effort, one becomes identified with Heaven and Earth." This point cannot be said to be different from Xiangshan's learning.<55>

Zhu-Lu Syncretic School (朱陸折衷派)
This includes Chen Longchuan (陳龍川), Ye Shuixin (葉水心), Zhang Nanxuan (張南軒), Lü Donglai (呂東萊)... Later, there were Wei Heshan (魏鶴山) and Zhen Xishan (眞西山). After them, when the Song dynasty fell and the Yuan dynasty began, there were Xu Luyuan (許魯淵) and Liu Jingxiu (劉靜修).
Furthermore, among Ming philosophers, there were Wu Kangyuan (吳康淵), Hu Jingyuan (胡敬淵), Chen Baisha (陳白沙), Wang Yangming (王陽明), and Luo Jing'an (羅敬庵). However, due to lack of space, I cannot list them all one by one. Among them, I will introduce Wang Yangming, who can be considered representative of early modern philosophy.

Wang Yangming (王陽明)
Biography and Writings
Wang Yangming's given name was Shouren (守仁), and his courtesy name was Bo'an (伯安). He was a descendant of Wang Xizhi (王羲之, Jin dynasty figure). He was born in the Ruiyun Lou (瑞雲樓) on the 30th day of the 9th month in the 8th year of the Chenghua (成化) era of Emperor Xianzong of Ming (1472). He began speaking at the age of five. At eleven, while traveling with his father to Jinshan (金山), he composed a poem. Shouren composed: "Jinshan, a single point, large as a fist, / Smashes the heavens beneath Weiyang's waters. / Drunkenly leaning on Miaogao Terrace's moon, / A jade flute plays through the dragon's cave eye." His father was greatly astonished and ordered him to compose another poem on the mountain moon. Shouren immediately responded: "The mountain is near, the moon far, making the moon seem small; / Thus, they say this mountain is larger than the moon. / If a person had eyes as large as the sky, / They would still see the moon small and the mountain broader."
Thus, when Yangming was 35, due to submitting a memorial on state affairs, he offended the emperor and was banished to Longchang Post (龍場驆). The following year, the 2nd year of Zhengde (正德, 1507), while en route to his place of exile, he stayed overnight in a deserted temple in the wilderness, unaware it was a tiger's lair. At midnight, a tiger circled outside the wall, roaring, but ultimately did not enter. The next day, a monk came, saw him sleeping soundly, and was greatly astonished, recognizing him as an extraordinary person. He welcomed him into the monastery. Wang wrote a poem on the wall: "Danger and ease originally do not hinder the *mind* (險夷原不滯*中); / How different are they from floating clouds passing through the great void? / Night is quiet, sea waves stretch thirty thousand li; / Moonlight bright, a flying tin staff descends from the celestial wind." The following year, upon reaching Longchang, one night he had a great enlightenment regarding the meaning of "investigating things and extending knowledge" (格物致知), advocating the theory of the unity of knowledge and action (知行一合). He died at the age of 57.
Yangming was not only lofty in thought but also particularly skilled in literary expression. His writings are the *Complete Works of Yangming* (陽明全書).

School Lineage
Attributing Wang Yangming's school lineage solely to Xiangshan is not entirely appropriate. Xiangshan's theory of the unity of knowledge and action seems to have originated from Yichuan (伊川, Cheng Yi). Therefore, in his reply to Wang Hūgu (王虎谷), he stated, "Master Cheng (程子) said, 'When knowledge arrives, following principle brings joy; not following principle brings displeasure. There are things one cannot help but do. Following principle brings joy.' Those who are not truly capable of knowing cannot easily reach this level of knowing. Knowing nature (性) means knowing benevolence (仁). Benevolence is the human mind (心). The mind-substance (心體) is originally broad and resolute. Those who are not broad are obscured; those who are not resolute are burdened. Therefore, when principle is clearly illuminated, selfish desires naturally cannot obscure or burden. When selfish desires naturally do not obscure, one naturally becomes broad and resolute." Therefore, Yangming's theory of the unity of knowledge and action can be said to be identical to Yichuan's. Only his emphasis on the mind as the primary focus of learning is not different from Xiangshan's. It is clear that Xiangshan's concept of "Mind is Principle" (心卽理) provided the foundation for the theory of the unity of knowledge and action. Thus, Yangming must be considered as belonging to the orthodox lineage of Lu Xiangshan.

Doctrine<56>

Theory of the Unity of Knowledge and Action (知行合一論)
Yangming's formulation of the theory of the unity of knowledge and action occurred when he was 37 years old. The following year, when he was 37 [Note: text says 37 twice, likely meant 36 and 37 or 37 and 38], his disciple Xu Ai (徐愛) asked about the unity of knowledge and action. He replied, "The *Great Learning* (大學) says, 'like loving a beautiful color' (如好好色). Seeing a beautiful color belongs to knowledge (知); loving the beautiful color belongs to action (行). The moment one sees the color, one already loves it; it's not that one first sees and then resolves the mind to love it. People today, however, say that knowledge comes first, then action. They engage in lectures, study, discussions to seek knowledge, and only when knowledge is truly obtained do they proceed to action. Consequently, they never act throughout their lives, and thus also never truly know." If seeing a beautiful color and loving a beautiful color occur simultaneously, this presupposes that human nature inherently possesses the tendency to love beautiful colors. When one sees a beautiful color, one inevitably loves it, and this love occurs at the very moment of seeing. Therefore, seeing and loving are merely like the surface and interior aspects of each other. He also said, "The point where knowledge is genuine, earnest, sincere, and solid is precisely action. The point where action is clear, aware, refined, and perceptive is precisely knowledge. If, at the time of knowing, the mind cannot be genuine, earnest, sincere, and solid, then that knowledge cannot be clear, aware, refined, and perceptive. It is not that at the time of knowing, one only needs clarity, awareness, refinement, and perception, and does not need genuineness, earnestness, sincerity, and solidity. If, at the time of acting, the mind cannot be clear, aware, refined, and perceptive, then that action cannot be genuine, earnest, sincere, and solid. It is not that at the time of acting, one only needs genuineness, earnestness, sincerity, and solidity, and does not need clarity, awareness, refinement, and perception. Knowing the transformations and nourishment of Heaven and Earth, the mind-substance (心體) is originally clear about this."
In essence, knowledge and action are like surface and interior to each other. Of course, Yangming also acknowledged that one is formal and the other concrete. But where does the foundation of the theory of the unity of knowledge and action lie? It lies solely in "Mind is Principle" (心卽理). Therefore, he said, "Seeking principle outside the mind—this is why knowledge and action become two. Seeking principle within my mind—this leads to the unity of knowledge and action, the teaching of the Sage's Gate (聖門)." This is the outline of Yangming's theory of the unity of knowledge and action. Now, its relationship to Yichuan and Xiangshan can be shown as follows [Note: The text indicates a comparison will follow, but it doesn't appear in the provided excerpt].

Extension of Innate Knowledge (致良知)
Yangming considered the theory of the unity of knowledge and action as the primary principle of his learning. If so, what is the method for knowing good and evil? He said, "If one cannot clarify principle through investigation (窮理), then seek it in the mind." Thus, regarding how to know the principle inherent in the mind, he affirmed the existence of innate knowledge (良知), stating that innate knowledge is suited for this task: "Knowing good and knowing evil is innate knowledge (自知)." He also interpreted the phrase "extending knowledge" (致知) in the *Great Learning* as extending innate knowledge. Let us briefly explain what innate knowledge is. (1) Distinction between Innate Knowledge and Mind: When looking at Yangming's explanation of the distinction between innate knowledge (良知) and mind (心), innate knowledge is discussed in relation to spiritual clarity that is unobscured (靈昭不昧), while mind is discussed in relation to principle (理). "The nature endowed by Heaven (天命之性) is purely and perfectly good. Its spiritual clarity, unobscured,<57> is all the manifestation of this perfect goodness. This is luminous virtue (明德) and what is called innate knowledge (良知)." Therefore, the original substance (本體) of luminous virtue is innate knowledge. Regarding the mind, he said, "Mind is nature (性); nature is Heaven (天). The mind of the sage is purely heavenly principle (天理), hence requires no learning." Therefore, to put it in one word, when viewed from the aspect of the mind's spiritual clarity that is unobscured, it is innate knowledge.
(2) Innate Knowledge is Ever-Present: Although the mind can be obscured, knowledge is not always obscured. He said, "Even when deluded thoughts arise, innate knowledge is never absent. But if people do not know how to preserve it, it may sometimes be lost. Even in extreme obscurity, innate knowledge is never not luminous. To say that innate knowledge also has moments of arising implies that it is sometimes inactive, which is not speaking of its original substance (本體)."
(3) Innate Knowledge Pervades All Things: In his words, "Every person's innate knowledge is precisely the innate knowledge of grass, trees, tiles, and stones. If grass, trees, tiles, and stones lacked human innate knowledge, they could not be grass, trees, tiles, and stones. Not only grass, trees, tiles, and stones—if Heaven and Earth lacked human innate knowledge, Heaven and Earth also could not be Heaven and Earth." This statement, based on the view that innate knowledge and mind are the same substance, and simultaneously that "Principle is Nature" (卽理卽性) and "Nature penetrates internal and external without duality," has absolutely no connection with idealism (唯心論). The assertion that innate knowledge exists universally in every person is a necessary conclusion stemming from his premise of "Mind is Principle," so there is no need to discuss it further here.

Intention (意)
The foundation and concept of the unity of knowledge and action have already been explained, and it has also been shown that knowing the good and evil of principle is the function of this innate knowledge (良心). Now, to summarize this in one word: "That which moves in response, being the empty, spiritual, clear innate knowledge, is called intention (意). There is intention only after there is knowledge; without knowledge, there is no intention. Is knowledge, then, not the substance (體) of intention?" After knowing, there is intention; intention is volition (意志). If there is knowledge, there must be this volition, just as knowing the delicious taste of something leads to desiring it. Once there is volition, it is inevitably expressed in action. Therefore, "Where intention is applied, there must be its object (物); the object is the affair (事). For example, if intention is applied to serving parents, then serving parents is one object. If intention is applied to governing the people, then governing the people is one object. If intention is applied to reading books, then reading books is one object. If intention is applied to hearing litigation, then hearing litigation is one object." Not only is intention inevitably expressed in action, but the object (物), i.e., action, and intention necessarily share the same form. In other words, ethical action is both a necessary aspect of human nature and something that necessarily manifests. Ethical action invariably has its source pre-established a priori. Thus, he asked, "Considering the applications of intention, there is none that does not involve an object. If there is this intention, there is this object; without this intention, there is no object. Is the object not the function (用) of intention?" Therefore, action, intention, and knowledge are a single entity, differing only in their state (態). This is the essence of Yangming's teaching.<58>

Luo Zheng'an (羅整菴)
Although Yangming's learning flourished like this, there were not a few who raised distinct banners besides him. Among them, the most noteworthy is Luo Zheng'an (羅整菴). Zheng'an's given name was Qinshun (欽順), and his courtesy name was Yunsheng (允升); Zheng'an was his style name. He died on the 24th day of the 4th month in the 26th year of Jiajing (嘉靖, 1547) at the age of 83. He was posthumously granted the title Grand Protector of the Heir Apparent (太子太保) and the posthumous name Wenzhuang (文莊). His writings consist solely of the *Kunzhi Ji* (困知記, Record of Knowledge Gained Through Difficulty); besides this, there are writings discussing learning and Buddhism. Looking at Wang Yangming's letters to Zheng'an reveals that he gained much benefit. That Zheng'an's learning originated from Buddhism is clear from his own preface: "Formerly, when serving as an official in the capital, I met an old monk and casually asked him how one attains Buddhahood. He also casually cited a Chan phrase in reply: 'Buddha is the cypress tree in the courtyard.' Thinking there must be some meaning to it, I pondered deeply until dawn. As I gathered my clothes to rise, I suddenly had an enlightenment, and unconsciously sweat flowed over my whole body. Afterwards, I obtained the *Zhengtong Ge* (證通歌, Song of Verified Comprehension?) and read it as if matching tallies. I considered it supremely wondrous and subtle."
Let us now briefly outline the main points of his philosophy.
(1) Zheng'an considered vital force (氣) to be primary, and principle (理) to be an abstract entity attached to qi. Pervading Heaven and Earth and spanning past and present, there is nothing without qi. Qi is fundamentally one. "One movement, one stillness; one going, one coming; one closing, one opening; one ascending, one descending—cycling endlessly. Thereupon arise warmth, coolness, cold, heat, becoming growth, flourishing, harvest, storage; becoming daily norms and ethical relations; becoming success and failure—in thousands of strands and myriad threads, all occur without knowing why they are so. This is the so-called principle (理)." He also said, "It is not initially that there is a separate thing that relies on qi to stand and attaches to qi to operate." At this point, one can see that his concept of principle is even more abstract than Zhu Xi's. Therefore, he clearly indicated the origin of Zhu Xi's learning and refuted it, saying, "Regarding the three phrases in the *Explanation of the Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate* (太極圖說)—'the reality of the Non-ultimate' (無極之眞), 'the essence of the Two [Modes, i.e., Yin-Yang] and Five [Agents]' (二五之精), 'subtly uniting and condensing' (妙合而凝)—I cannot but have doubts. Everything must have two aspects before one can speak of combination. Are the Supreme Ultimate (太極) and Yin-Yang truly two separate things? If they are indeed two things, where were they located separately before they combined? Zhu Xi generally treats principle and qi as two things; the origin likely stems from this."
(2) Principle is One, Manifestations are Many (理一分殊): Zheng'an's explanation of 'principle is one, manifestations are many' has points that can be called significantly more detailed than Zhu Xi's. He said, "The subtlety of nature (性) and destiny (命) lies in the four characters 'principle is one, manifestations are many' (理一分殊). When a single thing is produced, at the beginning of receiving qi, its principle is just one. But after form is achieved, its particular manifestation (分) differs. This difference in manifestation is nothing but the natural principle.
The oneness of principle always exists within the manifoldness of manifestations; this is the reason for the subtlety of nature and destiny. Speaking from the perspective of the one principle, therefore, everyone can become Yao or Shun. Speaking from the perspective of the differing qi, therefore, the highest wisdom and the lowest stupidity cannot be changed." He also said, "Heaven, Earth, humans, and things are just one principle. However, when speaking of the Way of Heaven, we say Yin and Yang; when speaking of the Way of Earth, we say hard and soft; when speaking of the Way of Man, we say benevolence and righteousness." These are all its particular manifestations. Generally, nature (性) is identical with destiny (命), and the Way (道) differs according to form (形).<59>

Yi T'oegye (李退溪)
Biography
T'oegye's name was Hwang (滉); he was a Chosŏn person. Born in the 7th year of King Yŏnsan's reign (14th year of Ming Emperor Xiaozong, 1501), he was brilliant as a child and diligent, meticulous, and rigorous as an adult. He was quiet and immersed in classical texts, and also possessed expertise in military strategy. When serving in the court, he became a Sama Sajŏng (司馬司正). Later, due to illness, he retired to his village home and devoted himself entirely to literary pursuits. He exerted the most effort on the writings of Zhu Xi. Thus, his compilation of excerpts from Zhu Xi's writings amounts to 20 volumes. His own works include *Chasŏngnok* (自省錄, Record of Self-Reflection), *Yi T'oegye Sŏch'o* (李退溪書抄, Excerpts from Yi T'oegye's Letters), *Ch'ŏnmyŏng Tosŏl* (天命圖說, Illustrated Explanation of the Mandate of Heaven), *Sŏmyŏng Kangŭi* (西銘講義, Lecture on the Western Inscription), etc.

School Lineage and Doctrine
T'oegye revered the learning of Zhu Xi. Thus, his view that the mind encompasses both principle (理) and vital force (氣), and that nature (性) has distinctions between original nature (本然之性) and physical nature (氣質之性), clearly follows Zhu Xi entirely. It is just that his contribution, following Zhu Xi, was the discovery that emotions (情) have two origins: those arising from principle and those arising from vital force. Thus, just as vital force necessarily has both original and physical aspects, so too emotions have two kinds: the Four Beginnings (四端) and the Seven Feelings (七情).
Therefore, he said, "Commiseration, shame and dislike, deference and compliance, right and wrong—whence do they arise? They arise from the nature of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom (仁義禮智之性). Joy, anger, sorrow, fear, love, hate, desire (喜怒哀懼愛惡欲)—whence do they also arise? External things touch one's physical form (形) and stir the mind within, arising accordingly. Regarding the arising of the Four Beginnings, Mencius already called them the mind (心). The mind is indeed a combination of principle and vital force. However, what is pointed to and spoken of primarily concerns principle. Why? The nature of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom is purely present within, and the four are their sprouts (端緖). Regarding the arising of the Seven Feelings, Master Cheng (程子) called it 'activity within' (動於中), and Zhu Xi also said that when 'the name has its proper designation' (名有攸當), it certainly also combines principle and vital force. However, what is pointed to and spoken of primarily concerns vital force (氣). Why? When external things arrive, what is easily affected and moves first is none other than the physical form and vital force (形氣), and the seven are their seedlings (苗脈)." His exposition is extremely clear and refined. How can this not be likened to the view of the beautiful and charming scenery of our Chosŏn mountains and rivers, and the light, elegant, and free-spirited atmosphere breaking through the clear void of a frosty autumn sky? However, the details of the Master's history and philosophy will be recorded later in the introduction of Chosŏn's Ten Great Men, so only the outline is recorded here……………(End of T'oegye Section)

A Final Word
This topic has now come to an end. Due to the reporter's insufficient observation and incomplete references, I have dared to trace the intentions of such great ancient philosophers and briefly introduce the origins of the Eastern world of ideas and the basis of the universe's profound mysteries. Firstly, regarding the structure, I intended to divide it into three parts (upper, middle, lower) and finish in three installments. However, due to editorial constraints related to page space, it dragged on for too long, likely giving readers a sense of disjointedness, for which I feel uneasy even thinking about it myself, and I humbly ask for your generous understanding.<60> And borrowing the remaining page space, I wish to briefly state the feelings I personally gained regarding this topic, just as I felt them.
Contemplating the ideal lives of all the philosophers and accomplished scholars over the flowing millennia, how should one describe them? Calling it nature (性), or benevolence (仁), or principle (理), or mind (心), they established the ultimate paradise of reality on the other shore, and their spirit of sincerely heading towards it is exactly like thousands of rivers and streams majestically leading each other into the great ocean. However, by the fixed law of the universe where extreme tranquility (泰) brings obstruction (丕), and extreme obstruction brings tranquility again, whether this is ultimately fortunate or unfortunate, I do not know in detail. But somehow, over the past few hundred years, the cultural fortune has been obstructed, and the Eastern world, possessing such splendors and having formed such crystallizations, has reached today's state where its breath is faint and the twilight deepens. If we were merely madmen, idiots, or unconsciously wriggling creatures, it might be different, but for those with even a little aspiration, one cannot suppress a deep sigh at this point.
Consider this! If the dozens of philosophers mentioned earlier had only been preoccupied with their contemporary lives, indulging in nobility, drowning in wealth, absorbed in power and rights, and had despised the value of their ideals, where would we find the 'plum blossoms fragrant in the snow' of today's East? And how could they themselves have become figures of eternity, divinity, and spirituality, achieving everlasting immortality through the ideal minds of billions in later generations, namely us? The silkworm's mouth indeed became the treasure house of Wu silk and Shu brocade, but if, like ordinary insects, it merely tossed about restlessly amidst wind, dew, and lush grass, it would also be difficult to escape the poisonous beaks of birds.
Alas! That vast, azure, boundless inorganic realm is indeed our absolute paradise and divine mansion. It is vast and limitless, immense and boundless. From here, sages arise and philosophers emerge, daily treading its ground and hourly glimpsing its realm, yet it is merely like a drop in the great ocean. The remainder, eternally unchanging—perhaps it awaits us, the new people of today, for its fundamental problems to find resolution.
If so, the first thing we must do is to be proud of the East while envying the West, review the East while learning from the West, and export the East while importing the West. We too possess a history second to none, and especially in all aspects of ethics, morality, and philosophy—that is, spiritual culture—it would likely not be an overstatement to say that there is still no West superior to the East. Nevertheless, despite this, that since the dawn of our half-myriad years of recorded history, there has been no second *Book of Changes* after the *Book of Changes*, no second Confucius after Confucius, and no second T'oegye after T'oegye, is difficult not to call our historical regret, our national regret, our Eastern shame, and simultaneously a world shame. Therefore, taking the traditional Eastern moral philosophy described above as the first foundation, I earnestly hope that from now on, progressing one step further, great philosophers of a modernized Eastern moral philosophy will appear again… (End)<61>

**Summary**

This article, the final part of a series, explores the lineage and core ideas of key figures in Southern Song and Chosŏn Neo-Confucianism, focusing on the Lu-Wang School (School of Mind). It details Lu Xiangshan's concept of "Mind is Principle" (心卽理) and its roots, contrasting it with the Cheng-Zhu school. It then discusses Yang Jian's extension of this idea and introduces the Zhu-Lu syncretic school before focusing extensively on Wang Yangming, his doctrine of the "Unity of Knowledge and Action" (知行合一), and the concept of "Innate Knowledge" (良知). Luo Qinshun's philosophy, emphasizing *qi* over *li*, is briefly covered. Finally, it introduces the Chosŏn scholar Yi T'oegye (Yi Hwang) as a follower of Zhu Xi but notes his specific contribution regarding the dual origin of emotions (Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings). The author concludes with a lament for the decline of Eastern philosophy and a passionate call for its revival and modernization in contemporary times, urging Koreans to study and export Eastern thought while learning from the West.

For historians, the article is interesting as a reflection of intellectual discourse in colonial Korea (1921). It shows a continued engagement with traditional East Asian philosophy (Neo-Confucianism) but frames it within a context of perceived cultural stagnation ("Eastern shame"). The author's final call to "export the East" while importing the West reveals a nationalist sentiment seeking cultural parity and revitalization amidst colonial rule and the influx of Western ideas. It reflects an attempt to find indigenous intellectual resources for navigating modernity.

南宋 及 朝鮮哲學

陸學… 陸象山
叙論(博幷書)
陸象山의 名은 九淵이오. 字는 子靜이니 金谿人이라. 紹興9年 2月에 生하니 3, 4歲時부터 그 鄭重함이 成人과 如하야 事物을 遇하면 必問하더니 1日은 忽然히 天地의 窮際如何를 其父에게 問하엿고 5歲에 始讀書할새 伊川의 言을 讀하다가 孔子의 言과 類치 아님을 批評하고 13歲 頃에 古書를 讀하다가 宇宙 2字에 至하야 解曰 『上下四方을 宇라 하고 往古來今을＜51＞ 宙라』云하엿고 忽然 大省하야 曰 『宇宙는 元來 無窮하니 人天地萬物이 皆無窮의 中에 在한 者라』하엿다. 又曰 『宇宙便是吾心, 吾心卽宇宙, 東海有聖人出焉, 此心同也此理同也, 西海有聖人出焉, 此心同也此理同也南海有聖人出焉, 此心同也, 此理同也, 千百歲之上, 有聖人出焉, 此心此理同也, 千百歲之下有聖人出焉, 此心此理同也』라 하니라. 象山의 學이 此時에 벌서 成하엿다. 謂할지로다. 後에 夷狄의 亂華를 見하고 慨然히 平天下의 大志를 *하고 弓馬를 習하다가 終年에는 貴溪山에 들어가 修道를 할새 其山의 形象이 恰然히 象과 如함으로써 듸디어 名하야 象山이라 하다. 그리하야 享壽 54에 卒한 바 嘉定 10年에 謚하야 文安이라 하다. 그의 著한 바는 오즉 象山全集에 在하니

學統
陸象山의 學은 가장 簡易하고 또 直截함이 그의 特色이라 할지니 그 學風의 發起進長한 바는 即
(一)家學 (二)時勢 (三)朱子派의 反動이란
此 三者에 歸할만 하나니, 그의 父와 祖父는 皆王震澤 及 謝上蔡를 經하야 明道의 學에 影響하엿다 할지로다.
吾人은 玆에 更進하야 象山의 本領되는 心卽理의 觀念을 明暸히 思索코저 하는 바 오즉 象山이 因襲한 者를 指摘하건대 左와 如하나니
(一)性善 (二)理는 遍滿 (三)氣質이 是로다

(一)性善
象山이 일즉 學者에게 告하야 曰『汝, 耳自聰, 目自明, 事父自能孝, 事兄自能悌, 本無少缺, 不必他求, 在乎自立而己』라 하엿스니 此-即 性善을 謂한 者-며 又曰 『人性本善, 其不善者遷於物也』라 하엿다. 然한즉 彼가 性善이라 한 바의 根據를 尋覓하여 보면 即 人은 其地의 中을 受하야 生함으로써-라 함에 不外하니 故로 王順伯에게 與한 書에 曰 『善人受天地之中 以生 其本心無不善』이라 하니라.

(二)理는 遍滿
象山이 理에 대한 觀念은 程, 朱와 共히 『一般天人一貫』이라 云함에 不外하니라. 然함으로 則以學文이라고 題한 小文에 하엿스되 『宇宙之間典常之昭然, 倫類之燦然, 是何適而無其理也, 學者之爲學, 固所以明是理也』라 하고 又吳南斗에게 與한 書에 云하엿스되 『塞宇宙一理耳 上古聖人先覺此理故 其王天下也 仰則觀象於天 俯則觀法於地 觀鳥獸之文 與地之宜 近取之於身 遠取之於物』이라 하고 又曰『天下事事物物 只有一理無有二理』-라 하니라. 其他 此와 類似한 者-極多하나 일일히 枚擧키 未遑함으로 玆에 省畧하노라.＜52＞

(三)氣質
象山은 元來 理氣의 說을 不取하나 然이나 氣質에 厚薄强弱의 差-有함을 豫想하엿스니 曰『人之生也不能皆上智不惑 氣偏弱則 耳目之官 不思而蔽於物』이라 하엿스나 此則程, 朱 等과 一般이라 然하면 彼의 所謂 氣質은 程, 朱 等 學說과 如何히 異한가? 吾人은 此에 至하야 彼의 根本的 思想에 論及치 안흠을 不得할지로다.

哲學
心
象山은 從來 學者들이 主唱한 바 人心과 道心의 別이 有하다 함은 徹頭徹尾히 打破하야 曰 『心一也 人無有二心』이라 하엿도다. 然한데 從來 學者들이 人心, 道心의 別을 唱한 바 자는 即 書經에 云한 바『人心惟危道心惟微』에 本하엿스니 象山은 此에 對하야 曰 『自人而言則曰惟危 自道而言則曰惟微』-라 하고 다시 그 危와 微된 바를 解하야 曰 『罔念作狂 克念作聖 非危乎 無聲無臭 無形無軆, 非微乎』라 하엿스니 此는 人心, 道心의 別이 업시 唯一軆로써 다만 觀察의 方面이 異함에 從하야 二樣이 될 것 뿐이라 함이니 即 明道, 上蔡에 크게 異한 바-은 而况伊川이며 朱子-리오.
以爲天理人欲을 分하면 此는 天人一軆의 觀念을 破하는 所以로다. 그럼으로 그 誤謬를 破하야 曰 『天理人欲之分論極有病 自禮記有此言而後人襲之 記曰人生而靜天之性 感於物而動 性之欲也 若是則動亦是靜亦是 豈有天理物欲之分 動若不是則 靜亦不是豈有動靜之間哉』아하야 天理로써 靜이라 하고 人欲으로써 動이라 하엿다. 그러햐야 動靜이 皆性에서 出함이 아님이 無한 바 1로써 是라 하고 又 1로써 不是라 하면 어찌 眞理가 有하다 하리요.
然한데 從來의 學者들은 皆天理로써 道心이라 하고 人爲로써 人心이라 하엿나니 象山에 在하야는 人心, 道心의 別이 無하고 天理, 人欲의 分이 無하며 오즉 動과 靜과를 該하는 바의 一個心이 有할 뿐이라 하엿다. 그리고 보면 所謂 心이란 者는 果然 何者일가?

心卽理
佛의 見性成佛을 說함과 象山의 心을 說함이 頗히 類似하나니 此에 引한 바 者는 가장 그 觀念을 表한 者-로다. 曰 『論語中多有無頭柄的說話 如知及之 仁不能守之之類 不知所及所守者何事 如學而時習之不知時習之者-何事＜53＞ 非學有本領 未易讀也 苟有本領則 知之所及者 及此也仁之所守者 守此也時習之 習此也 說者說此 樂者樂此 如高屋之上建領水矣』-라 하엿도다.
象山의 所謂 此라 함은 即 此心을 指함이니 故로 彼가 完然히 禪家와 同一의 理想을 用하야 曰 『道理只是道理 雖見到聖人田地 亦是眼前道程』이라 하야 心으로써 一個至大의 者 即 理를 具한 者이라 하엿도다. 故로 (義理之在人心實是天之所爲與而不可泯焉者也』-라 하엿다. 然하면 義理의 心은 二가 되는가? 曰不然하다. 義理는 此心의 檥式에 不外하니 『盖人之所固有心之所同然也心卽理』라 云할만 할 것뿐이로다. 然한데 此理는 即 自然의 理-라 自然의 理에 循함에 어찌 內外表裡의 別이 有하리오.
然하나 個人이 相異한 바는 即 氣質이 相異함으로써-라 무릇 心은 固有의 法則에 由하야 活動코저 하나 恒常 耳目이 物欲에 蔽한 故로 自己를 完全히 實現키 不能하도다. 以此觀之하면 如何히 朱子와 異한 點을 可見하겟도다.

工夫論
窮理의 義意
窮理의 義意는 實로 象山에서 始明하엿스니 其然한 바자는 『理卽心 心卽一矣』의 主義-有함으로써-라. 그럼으로 象山은 以爲하되 所謂 窮理 所謂 格物이 皆 自己의 田地를 開拓함에 不外하나니 我에 다시 添加할 바-無하고 오즉 自有한 바를 意識함에 止할 뿐이라. 그럼으로 吾-六經을 註함이 아니오 六經이 皆我의 註脚이라 하니라. 此-即 自家와 他家와의 相異한 바-니 曰 『吾之學問 與諸處異者 只是在我 全無杜撰 雖千言萬語 只是覺得他底 在我不曾添一些 近有議吾者 云除了先立乎其大者一句 全無伎倆 吾聞之曰誠然』이라 하니라.
然한데 心의 善을 發揮함에는 무엇보다도 먼저 物欲을 除却함에 亶在할 것 뿐이라. 故曰 『今之論學者 只務添人底 自家只是減他底 此所以不同』이라 하나니 象山의 工夫의 要義는 實로 此에 在하도다. 又曰『格物者格此者也 伏羲仰象俯法 亦先於此盡力焉 不然所謂格物 末而已矣』라 하엿나니 此者는 即 心이니라.

思之
象山이 曰『自立自重 不可隨人脚跟 學人言語』라 하니 此一節로써 能히 彼의 學風 一般을 見함에 足하도다.＜54＞ 然한데 人의 脚跟을 不從하며 人의 言語를 不學하면 如何함이 可하가? 曰『義理之在人心 實天之所與而不可泯滅焉者也 彼其受蔽於物而至於悖理違理 此盖亦弗思焉耳 誠能反而思之 則是非取捨盖有隱然而動 判然而明 決然無疑者矣』-라 하엿고 又彼-恒常 學者를 敎하야 曰『各自圓滿 唯要自立』이라 하니라.

結論
要컨대 象山의 直截 簡易한 學風은 當時의 時勢 及 學風에 對한 反動으로 그의 心卽理의 觀念은 即 窮理와 實踐과를 結合한 바 所謂 窮理格物이라 함은 自己의 本心을 自己로써 自覺함에 不外할 뿐이다. 딸아서 此本心의 大且重한 바를 知케 함이 入學의 初門이니라. 然한데 象山이 沒한 後에 그 學統을 繼하엿다 할만한 者-有二하니 一은 門人 楊慈湖요 一은 明의 王陽明이니라.

楊慈湖
楊慈湖의 名은 簡이오 字는 敬中이니 年86에 文元이라 謚하다. 그 著한 바는 己易, 啓蔽其他禮에 關한 者-有하다.
慈湖는 象山의 心卽理의 觀念을 一層 推廣하야 一切의 法則은 皆我心內의 事라 하엿나니  其己易 一篇은 即 易의 所謂 天地의 運行, 日月의 交代가 皆自己의 範圍內에 在한 者라 하니라. 天地-即 我며 天地變化-即 我之變化-요 非他物이라 天者는 吾性中의 象이오 地者는 吾性中의 形이니 故로 曰 『在天成象 在地成形 皆吾之所爲也』라 하다. 然則 彼는 일즉 儒家의 範圍內에 拘束된 事-無하고 超然히 佛家의 域에 躍入하야 曰 「吾未見天地, 人之有三也 三者形也 一者性也卽道也」-라 하고 又曰 「易也名之不同而其實一軆」-라하야 自己의 性은 即 易이니 所謂 變化像을 皆此에 求함이 足하나니 故로 易與天地準이라 云함은 孔子의 言이 아니니라. 『天地卽易幽明本無』-라 是以로 반듯이 仰觀俯察한 後에 其故를 知할 것이 아니라 하니 明決히 佛敎思想에 混合한 者-是로다.
其他 象山의 學을 傳한 者는 舒廣平 素繫淵이 有하나니 廣平은 又 張南軒에게 問한 바-有하고 繫淵은 呂東萊를 訪한 事-有하나 其學이 大槪 象山을 主하엿다. 繫淵이 曰 『大哉心乎 與天地一本 精思而得之 勉業而守之則與天地相以』-라 하엿나니 此卽 象山의 學과 同一히 안타 謂키 不能한 點이로다.＜55＞

朱陸折衷派
此에는 陳龍川 葉水心 張南軒 呂東萊...後에 魏鶴山 眞西山 等이 有하고 其後 宋이 滅하고 元에 至하야 許魯淵 劉靜修 等이 有하니라.
又 明의 哲學으로는 吳康淵 胡敬淵 陳白沙 王陽明 羅敬庵 等이 有하다. 그러나 餘暇가 無함으로 一一히 列擧치 못하고 其中 近世哲學에 代表할만한 者卽 王陽明을 紹介하노라.

王陽明
傳幷書
王陽明의 名은 守仁이오 字는 伯安이니 王右軍*之의 後裔(晉時人)라. 明의 憲宗 成化 8年 9月 30日에 瑞雲樓에서 生하니 5歲에 始言하고 11歲 時에 其父와 더부러 金山에 遊하야 詩를 賦할 새 守仁이 賦하야 曰 『金山一点大如拳 打破維陽水底天 醉依妙高臺上月 玉簫吹徹洞龍眼』이라 함에 其父 大驚하야 다시 山月을 賦케 命하니 守仁이 隨而答曰『山近月遠覺月小 便道此山大於月 若人有眼大如天 還見月小山更闊』이라 하다.
그리하야 陽明의 年이 35에 有事하야 上疏하다가 上意에 忤하야 龍場驆에 黜한 바 되엇다가 明年 即 正德 2年에 謫所에 赴할 새 途中 野廟에서 投宿하야 그 虎穴임을 未知하엿더니 夜半에 虎-墻外를 環하야 吠하면서 遂不入하니라. 明日에 僧이 來하야 그 熟睡함을 見하고 大驚하야 奇人임을 知하고 寺에 迎入한대 詩를 壁에 書하야 曰 『險夷原不滯*中 何異浮雲過太空 夜靜海濤三萬里 月明飛錫下天風』이라 하다. 明年에 龍場에 至하야 一夜에 大히 格物致知의 旨를 悟하야 知行一合의 說을 主唱하고 年 57에 卒하니라.
陽明은 獨히 思想이 高尙할 뿐만 아니라 兼하야 文辭에 特히 巧妙하엿나니 其著한 바 陽明全書-是니라.

學統
王陽明의 學統으로써 專혀 此를 象山에 屬함은 穩當치 못하니라. 象山의 知行合一說은 其端을 伊川에서 發함과 如하다. 그럼으로 그의 王虎谷에게 答한 書에 云하엿스되 『程子云知之而至則循理爲樂 不循理爲不樂 自有不能己者 循理爲樂者也 非眞能知者 未易及知之 知性則知仁矣 仁人心也 心軆本自弘毅 不弘者蔽之也 不毅者累之也 故燭理明則 私欲自不能蔽累 私欲自不蔽則自不無弘毅矣』-라 하엿도다. 故로 陽明의 知行合一論은 伊川과 同一하다 謂할지며 唯心으로써 學問의 第一義라 함은 象山에 異치 아니하니라. 象山의 心卽理의 觀念은 즉 知行合一論의 基礎를 得할만 함이 明白하도다. 然則 陽明은 陸象山으로써 正統을 삼지 아님을 不得하겟도다.

學說＜56＞

知行合一論
陽明의 知行合一論의 發明은 37歲의 時에 在하니 그 翌年 即 37歲의 時에 그의 門人 徐愛-知行合一을 問함에 答曰 『大學言如好好色 見好色屬知好好色屬行 見色時己是好 非見而後始立心去好也 今人却謂 先知而後行 且講習討論以求知 優知得眞時方去行 故遂終身不行 亦遂終不知』-라 하니 好色을 見함과 好色을 好함이 若同時가 된다하면 此는 人性에 好色을 好하는 性이 自有한 事를 預想한 者-라 好色을 見하면 반듯이 此를 好하고 此를 好함은 반듯이 此를 見할 當時에 在하니 그럼으로 見함과 好함과는 表裡相爲의 別이 有할 것뿐이로다. 又曰 『知之眞切篤實處便是行 行之明覺精察處 便是知 若知時 其心不能眞切篤實則其知便不能明覺精察 不是知之時 只要明覺精察 更不要眞切篤實也 行之時其心不能明覺精察則 其行便不能眞切篤實 不是行之時 只要眞切篤實 更不要明覺精察也 知天地之化育 心軆原是明此』-라 하다.
要컨대 知와 行과는 表裡相爲하는 者-니 勿論 知와 行과는 一은 形式的, 一은 具軆的인 事는 陽明도 亦此를 認하엿나니라. 然한데 知行合一論의 基礎는 何에 在한가 하면 心卽理에 在할 것 뿐이엇다. 故曰 『心外以求理 此知行之所以二也 求理於吾心則 此知行合一 聖門之敎』-라 하엿나니 此는 陽明의 知行合一論의 大畧이니라. 이제 그 伊川과 象山에 對한 關係如何를 表示하면 左와 如하니라.

致良知
陽明은 知行合一論으로써 그 學問의 第一義라 하엿스니 그리고 보면 善惡을 知하는 바 工夫는 如何한가? 曰 『理를 窮하야 明치 못하면 即 此를 心에 求할지라』하다. 그리하야 其心에 具備한 理는 如何히 此를 知할고 함에 至하얀 彼는 良知의 存在를 認定한 바 良知가 即 其局에 當할 만한 者-라 하야 曰 『知善知惡 是自知』-라 하다. 彼又大學에 所謂 致知를 解하야 曰此는 即 良知를 致함이라 하엿나니 이제 暫間 良知란 何者임을 說明코저 하노라.    (一)良知와 心과의 別 陽明이 良知와 心과의 別을 說함을 見하면 良知는 靈昭不昧에 付하야 云하고 心은 即 理에 付하야 云하엿나니 『天命之性 粹然至善 其靈不昧者＜57＞ 皆其至善之發見 是乃明德而所謂良知者也』-라 하니 故로 明德의 本軆는 即 良知-며 又其心을 解함에 曰 『心性也 性天也 聖人之心純乎天理 故無俟於學』이라 하니라. 故로 此를 一言으로써 蔽하고 보면 心의 靈昭不昧한 點으로부터 見할 時는 即 良知-是로다.
(二)良知는 常住니라 心은 昏塞되는 事-有하나 知는 常昏치 아니하나니 曰 『雖妄念之發而良知未嘗不在 但人不知存則有時而或放矣 雖昏塞之極而良知未嘗不明 若謂良知亦有起處 是有時而不任也非其本軆之謂也』-라 하니라.
(三)良知는 萬物에 普遍 其言에 云하엿스되 『凡人的良知 就是草木瓦石的良知 若草木瓦石無人的良知 不可以爲草木瓦石矣 豈唯草木瓦石 以其天地而無人的良知 天地亦不可爲天地』-라 하엿스니 是說은 良知와 心과는 同軆임과 同時에 卽理卽性이라 『性은 內外를 貫徹하야 無二』라는 說에 本한 者임으로써 唯心論과 寸毫의 關係가 無한 者로다. 그런데 良知가 各人에 在하야 普遍이 된다 함은 彼가 心卽理의 假定으로부터 伴한 必然의 結論인즉 今에 此를 論할 必要가 無하다 하노라.

意
知行合一의 基礎와 觀念은 이미 說明하고 兼하야 理의 善惡을 知함은 卽此良心된 所以를 明示한 바 今玆에 一言으로 此를 約컨대『其虛靈明確良知感應而動者謂之意有知而後有意, 無知則無意矣 然則知非意之軆乎』아 하다. 知한 後-意가 有하니 意는 卽意志니라. 知-有하면 必此意志-有하나니 此가 恰然히 物의 美味를 知하면 卽此를 欲함과 如하다. 이미 意志가 有하면 必然的으로 行爲에 表現하나니 그럼으로 『意之所用 必有其物 物則事 如意用於事親 卽事親爲一物 意用於治民 卽治民爲一物 意用於讀書 卽讀書爲一物 意用於聽訟 卽聽訟爲一物』이라 하엿스니 意는 必然的으로 行爲에 表現할 뿐만 아니라 物 卽 行爲와 意와는 必然的 形式이 同한 者-니라. 換言하면 倫理的 行爲는 人性必然의 者임과 共히 必然으로 發現한 者-니라. 倫理的 行爲로써 그 淵源을 先大的으로 具備치 아님이 無하나니 卽曰 『擧意之所用 無有益 物者有是意 卽有是物 無是意卽無是物矣物非意之用乎』아 然則 行爲와 意와 知는 同一軆로 唯其態가 相異하다한 者-니 是卽 陽明敎學의 精華-니라라.＜58＞

羅整菴
陽明의 學은 此와 如히 盛하나 然이나 此外에 各別의 旗幟를 立한 者-不少하나니 其中 가장 注意할만한 者는 卽 羅整菴이라 한다. 整菴의 名은 欽順이오 字는 允升이니 整菴은 其 號니라. 嘉靖 26年 4月 24日에 卒하니 其壽-83이로다. 太子太保를 贈하고 文莊이라 謚하니라. 그리고 그의 著한 바는 오즉 困知記, 그 外學을 論하고 佛을 論한 書가 有하다. 王陽明이 整菴에 與한 書를 見하면 益을 得한 事多하니라. 整菴의 學이 佛氏에서 出하엿슴은 自叙에 由하야 明白하니 曰 『昔官京師 逢一老僧漫問 何由成佛 渠亦漫擧禪語爲答 佛在庭前栢樹子 意其必有所謂 爲之精思達旦攬衣將起 則怳然而悟 自不覺流汗通軆 旣而得證通歌 讀之如合符節 自以爲至奇至妙』라 하엿다.
今暫 彼의 哲學의 網要를 揭하면 卽如左하다.
(一)整菴은 以爲하되 氣는 主-요 理는 抽象的으로 氣에 附한 者-라 謂하니 天地를 通하며 古今에 亘하야 一이나 氣가 無한 者-無하다. 氣는 本是 一이니 『一動一靜一往一來 一闔一闢 一升一降이 循還不己하야 於是乎溫冷寒暑가 되어 生長收藏이 되매 日用彛倫이 되며 成敗-되어 千端萬緖로 皆不知然其然하니 是卽所謂理』라 하고 又曰 『初非別有一物 依於氣而立附於氣而行也』-라 하엿스니 此에 至하야 朱子보다도 理의 觀念이 抽象的됨을 可知할지라. 故로 彼가 明히 朱子學의 出處를 示하고 反駁하야 曰 『太極圖說 無極之眞 二五之精 妙合而凝三語 愚不能無疑 凡物必有兩而後 可以言合 太極與陰陽 果有二物乎 其爲物也果二則 方其未合之先 各安在耶朱子總理氣爲二物 其源蓋出於此』-라 하엿도다.
(二)理一分殊 整菴이 理一分殊를 說함이 朱子와 異한 바-大히 精細타 謂할만한 者-有하니 曰 『性命의 妙는 理一分殊의 四字에 在하니라. 一物의 生함은 氣를 受하는 初에 其理는 唯一뿐이요 但 成形의 後에 其分則各異하나니 其分의 異함은 卽自然의 理-아님이 無하니라.
其理의 一은 恒常 分殊의 中에 在하니 此-即 性命의 妙-된 所以라 하는도다. 其一되는 理로부터 云하는 故로 人皆爲堯舜이요 其殊되는 氣로부터 云하는 故로 上知下愚에 移치 못한다』 하엿고 又曰 『天地人物 只是一理 然而語天道則 曰陰曰陽 語地道則 曰剛柔 語人道則 曰仁義』-라 하니 此皆其分殊-니라. 大低性은 命으로 더불어 同하고 道는 形으로 더불어 異하니라.＜59＞

李退溪
傳
退溪의 名은 滉인 바 即 朝鮮人이라. 燕山朝 7年(明孝宗 14年)에 生하니 幼하야 穎悟하고 長하야 勤勉精厲하며 典籍에 靜하고 兼하야 兵學에 造詣하야 朝에 伍할새 司馬司正이 되엿더니 後에 病으로써 村閭에 退老하야 全혀 文學에 從事하엿스니 最渴力한 者는 朱子의 書라. 그리하야 朱子의 書를 取錄한 者 凡20卷이오 스스로 著한 바 自省錄 李退溪書抄 天命圖說 西銘講義 等이 有하니라.

學統 及 學說
退溪는 即 朱子의 學을 崇拜한 者-니라. 然하야 其心으로써 理氣를 統하엿다 하고 又 性에는 本然氣質의 別이 有하다 함은 全혀 朱子를 因襲한 者-分明하다. 只是朱子의 忠이라 함은 即 情이 理로부터 發한 者와 氣로부터 發한 者의 二端이 有함을 發見한 事-是-니라. 그리하야 氣에는 반듯이 本然, 氣質의 兩性이 有함과 如하며 又 情에도 二種이 有하니 即 四端과 七情이 是-니라.
故曰 『惻隱, 羞惡, 辭讓, 是非, 何從而發乎 發乎仁義禮智之性焉耳 喜, 怒, 哀, 懼, 愛, 惡, 欲 亦何從而發乎 外物觸其形而動乎中緣而出焉耳 四端之發 孟子旣謂之心心固理氣之合也 然而所指而言者 主於理何也 仁義禮智之性 粹然在中而四者其端緖也 七情之發 程子謂之動於中 朱子亦謂之名有攸當則 固亦兼理氣也 然而所指而言者則在乎氣 何者 外物之來 易感而先動者 莫如形氣而七者其苗脈也』-라 한 바니 그 叙論이 가장 明白하고 精粹하니 此-어찌 우리 朝鮮江山의 秀麗明媚한 景趣와 輕妙灑落한 氣像이 霜天白日의 太虛淸空을 破한 觀과 類치 안타 謂할가? 그런데 特히 先生의 歷史 及 哲學은 다음으로 朝鮮十大偉人의 紹介에 詳記하겟기 玆에 大網만 記하노라……………(退溪篇完)

本 問題는 일로부터 끗을 告하게 되엇습니다. 記者의 넉넉지 못한 觀察에 兼하야 完全치 못한 參考로써 저러틋 偉大한 千古哲人의 意趣를 敢히 溯究하야 東洋意想界의 由來와 宇宙玄奧의 根據如何를 略略紹介한 바 爲先 軆裁로 볼지라도 上中下의 3段으로 하야 3回에 終了하랴 하엿스나 編輯上 紙面의 關係로 因하야 넘우 오래 끄을어서 讀者 諸位에게 돌이어 支離한 感을 끼친 것은 스스로 생각할지라도 未安하오며 삼가 諸位의 寬恕를 비나이다.＜60＞ 그리고 紙面의 餘白을 빌어 本題에 대한 스스로 어든 느낌을 느낀 그대로 大綱엿줍고저 합니다.
생각컨대 滔滔數千年에 모든 哲人達士의 理想的 生活이야 말로 果然 如何타 謂하겟는가? 或 性이라 하며 或 仁이라 하고 或 理라고 하며 或 心이라 하야 究竟的 實在의 樂土를 彼岸에 定하고 篤實히 거긔에 向하는 氣槪는 마치 저 千江萬河가 汪汪히 相率하야 大洋에 放함과 恰如하도다. 그러나 此 所謂 泰-極하면 丕-來하며 丕-極하면 또다시 泰-來하는 宇宙의 定則으로써 畢竟 幸인가 不幸인가 詳未知어니와 何如間 伊來數百年에 文運이 丕塞하야 如斯한 精華를 有하고 如斯한 結晶을 成한 東洋天地로써 氣息이 奄奄하고 暮色이 沉沉한 今日의 狀態에 至하엿스니 吾人은 차라리 風癲白痴나 또는 無意識的 蠢動이라면 이어니와 저윽이 志-有한 者-라 하면 이 點에서 太息의 長嘆을 禁치 못할 바-라 하노라.
試思하라. 前記한 數十哲人으로 하여곰 當時的 生活에만 汲汲하야 萬若 貴에 處하며 富에 溺하며 權利에 沒하야 그 理想의 價値를 蔑視하엿던들 東洋 今日의 雪中香梅를 何處에 得見하엿스며 又 自己, 自身이 能히 千古的, 神的, 靈的의 人이 되어 後來億兆 卽 吾人의 理想腦를 通하야 永劫不滅을 安得하엿스리요 蠶蟲의 口는 果然 吳綾蜀帛의 靈庫가 되엇스나 例蟲과 如히 風露芃草의 間에 輾轉無聊한다 하면 亦是 鳥雀의 毒喙를 免키 難할지로다.
嗚呼라 彼 虛虛蒼蒼하야 廣漠無際의 無機裏는 果然 吾人의 絶對樂土-며 神府라 廣大無量하고 浩浩蕩蕩하야 此에서 聖人이 起하고 哲人이 興하야 日로 其所를 踏하고 時로 其境을 窺하되 오즉 大洋一滴에 不過할 것뿐이다. 其餘永劫不變의 그것은 아마 今日 吾等의 新人을 待하야 於是乎其宿題가 根本的 解決을 得하리라 하노라.
然하면  吾人은 무엇보다도 먼저 할 일은 西洋을 부러워하는 同時에 東洋을 자랑하며 西洋을 學하는 同時에 東洋을 復習하며 西洋을 輸入하는 同時에 東洋을 輸出하여야 하겟도다. 우리도 남만 못지 안흔 歷史를 가젓스며 더구나 倫理, 道德, 哲學의 모든 方面 即 精神上 文化로는 아즉까지 東洋에 右할 西洋이 無하다 하여도 過言이 아닐 줄로 思하노라. 그러나 此를 不拘하고 半萬年 有史以來로 周易 以後에 第二 周易이 無하고 孔子 以後에 第二 孔子-無하고 退溪 以後에 다시 第二 退溪가 無하엿슴이 우리의 歷史的 遺憾임과 同時에 民族的 遺憾이며 東洋的 羞恥임과 同時에 世界的 羞恥라 不謂키 難하도다. 그러면 以上에 記한 東洋自來의 道學을 第一期 土臺로 하고 이제로부터 거긔에 한거름 더 나아가 時代化的 東洋道學의 大哲人이 다시 잇기를 切望하야 마지아니하노라…(끗)＜61＞
