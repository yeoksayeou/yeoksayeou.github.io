社告 (Company Announcement)
Especially to those in charge of distribution centers in various locations and to our readers:

One, Please send the subscription fee for this magazine and the postage in advance (for three months, six months, or one year). We cannot send the magazine unless it is prepaid.

One, When sending money from each parish (敎區 - likely referring to distribution districts), please send it directly to the postal transfer account Kyŏngsŏng 8106 under the account holder name Gaebyeoksa (開闢社). If you indirectly send it to the postal transfer account Kyŏngsŏng 1363 under the account holder name No Hŏn-yong (盧憲容), there might be discrepancies as it may not be received within the expected timeframe.

One, When sending money via postal transfer, please be sure to write the reason for the remittance clearly in the communication column on the back of the transfer form, i.e., "X Won X Jeon is payment and postage for Gaebyeok issues No. X to No. X, X copies." If there is no note in the communication column, it causes great difficulty in processing the money.

One, When corresponding with our company, whether by postcard or sealed letter, please be sure to accurately write and send the sender's full name and address (Province, County, Township, Village, House Number). If the address is unclear, there is no way for us to send a reply to your inquiry or the items you requested.

Gaebyeoksa Accounting Department <72>

**Summary**

This is an administrative announcement from the Gaebyeoksa (Gaebyeok Publishing Company) Accounting Department in 1921, published in their magazine "Gaebyeok." It instructs distributors and readers on payment and communication procedures. Key points include the requirement for prepayment of subscription fees and postage, the specific postal transfer account details (emphasizing the direct company account over an individual's), the need for clear communication on transfer forms, and the importance of providing accurate sender addresses for correspondence. From a historical perspective, the reliance on the postal transfer system (振替口座) highlights the developing financial infrastructure in colonial Korea. The explicit instructions regarding payment methods and address details suggest potential difficulties in communication and financial transactions during this period, possibly reflecting both logistical challenges and perhaps the cautious environment under colonial rule. The mention of two different postal accounts, one corporate and one personal (No Hŏn-yong), might hint at the internal structure or operational history of the publishing house.
