Master Yi T'oegye, Patriarch of Eastern Neo-Confucianism, Part Two of Introducing Chosŏn's Ten Great Men

First, a brief account of the Master's life:

The Master's surname was Yi (李), given name Hwang (滉), courtesy name Kyŏngho (景浩), clan origin Chinbo (眞寶), and sobriquets T'oegye (退溪) and Toso (陶叟) (He once chose to live by T'oegye Stream, hence calling himself T'oegye. Later, he built a study hall at Tosan and called himself Toso). He first cried out in the world on the 25th day of the 11th month of Shinyu year, the 7th year of King Yŏnsan of the Yi Dynasty (420 years ago from now, the 14th year of Hongzhi of Emperor Xiaozong of Ming), in On'gye-ri, Yean County, Kyŏngsang Province (present-day Onhye-ri, Tosan-myŏn, Andong County, North Kyŏngsang Province). His lineage was quite respectable from the beginning; his sixth-generation ancestor Sŏk once served the Koryŏ Dynasty and was selected for the Sama examination. His grandfather Kyeyang and his father Chik were both Chinsa degree holders at the Sŏnggyun'gwan (National Confucian Academy) and were well-known figures in the Confucian circles of the time. The Master lost his father less than half a year after birth and grew up under the strict upbringing of his mother, Lady Pak. At the early age of six, he went to an elderly man in the neighborhood to learn the Thousand Character Classic (千字文). At twelve, he went to his uncle U (堣, sobriquet Songjae 松齋) to study the Analects (論語). Being of a particularly warm, respectful, and composed nature, the Master began to investigate the principles (窮理) of all things from this time. One day, regarding the character for principle (理), he asked his uncle Songjae, "Is everything that is right (凡事之是者) - is this principle (理乎)?" Songjae replied, "That is so. Do you already understand the meaning of the text?" He marveled at his extraordinary talent and would always say, "The one who will bring honor to our family gate will surely be this child." The Master's passion for reading grew daily thereafter. From the age of 14, even amidst a large crowd, he would invariably turn towards the wall and contemplate deeply. He particularly immersed himself in the poetry of Yuanming (淵明), admiring his character. When the Master was 18, in the spring, he happened to be strolling in Yŏn'gok (near On'gye) and composed a poem savoring the clarity of a small pond: "Dew-laden grasses endlessly encircle the water's edge, / The small pond, clear and lively, is pure without sand. / Clouds fly, birds pass, originally unconcerned with each other, / Only fearing the swallows that occasionally kick the waves (露草天天繞水涯, 小塘淸活淨無沙, 雲飛鳥過元相管, 只怕時時燕蹴波)." This poem subtly evokes Yuanming's pastoral poetry and, at the same time, allows us to glimpse that even then, he often contemplated the problem of heavenly principle and human desire. <73> At 19, he first read Zhu Xi's (朱子) Complete Works of Master Zhu (性理大全) and experienced a joy of heart and mind opening that he could not contain. At 20, he read the Book of Changes (周易), delving into its meaning, often working tirelessly all day and staying awake all night, which greatly harmed his physical health. To use the Master's own words, he acquired a lifelong chronic illness (痼疾). At 21, he married Lady Hŏ, and the following year, he first went to study at the university in Hansŏng (Seoul). It was after the Literati Purge of Kimyo (己卯士禍), and the scholarly atmosphere was frivolous. Seeing the Master's dignified bearing, many mocked him instead. Only Kim Inhu (金麟厚) associated with the Master. Thereafter, the Master studied even more diligently, passed the Chinsa examination at 28, passed the higher civil service examination at 33, becoming a Chŏngja (正字, proofreader) at the Sŭngmunwŏn (Office of Diplomatic Correspondence). He was subsequently promoted through various positions, including Assistant Section Chief of the Ministry of Taxation (戶曹佐郞), Chŏng'ŏn (正言, remonstrator) at the Saganwŏn (Office of the Censor-General), Kyo ri (校理, collator) at the Hongmun'gwan (Office of Special Advisors), Munhak (文學, tutor) at the Sejasi kangwŏn (Tutorial Office for the Crown Prince), Taesasŏng (大司成, headmaster) at the Sŏnggyun'gwan, Ch'ŏmjijung ch'ubusa (僉知中樞府使, associate councilor of the Office of the Royal Secretariat), and Vice Minister of Works (工曹叅判). At 66, he was appointed Minister of Works and Chief Scholar of the Office of Royal Decrees (工曹判書兼 大提學), but he firmly declined and returned to his hometown. The following year, Chŏngmyo, Emperor Jiajing of Ming China passed away, and a new emperor ascended the throne. An envoy was to arrive, and the court summoned the Master to prepare the response. He complied and went to the capital. At that time, King Myŏngjong passed away, and King Sŏnjo succeeded the throne. He was appointed Minister of Rites (禮曹判書), but he resigned due to illness and soon returned east. In October of that year and January of the following year, he received summons again but strongly declined with memorials. However, he was urged again by royal decree to come up, so he reluctantly went to the palace, personally stated his intention to resign, and presented the Ten Diagrams on Sage Learning (聖學十圖). He was reappointed Chief Scholar of the Office of Royal Decrees and Minister of Personnel (吏曹判書) but again firmly declined. In the 3rd month of Kisa year, when he was 69, he finally received the court's permission and returned to his hometown. In the 1st month of Kyŏngo year, the following year when he turned 70, he submitted a memorial requesting retirement (致仕), but it was strongly denied from above. Subsequently, in the 3rd, 4th, and 9th months, he requested retirement three more times, but permission was again denied. In the 11th month of this year, the Master's health declined exceptionally, and his disciples and followers stayed by his side. Alas, on the night of the 8th day of the 12th month, the Master entered eternal silence. When this news went beyond his gate, the reigning king personally went to the Chŏngwŏn (Royal Secretariat) and said, "Yi Hwang's death is something I deeply mourn (李滉의 死去는 내가 甚히 通悼하는 바라)." He posthumously conferred the title Taegwangboguk Sungnok Taebu Ŭijŏngbu Yŏngŭijŏng Kyŏm Yŏnggyŏngyŏn Hongmun'gwan Yemun'gwan Ch'unch'ugwan Kwansanggamsa (大匡輔國崇祿大夫議政府領議政兼 領經筵弘文舘 藝文舘 春秋館 觀象監事, Grand Prince Supporter of the State, Meritorious Grand Master, Chief State Councilor of the State Council, concurrent Director of the Office of Royal Lectures, Office of Special Advisors, Office of Royal Decrees, Office of State Records, and Bureau of Astronomy). He dispatched two close officials to offer condolences and perform memorial rites. Mourners from near and far arrived continuously for days. The number of attendees at the funeral reached over 300, consisting only of scholar-officials (士大夫) and Confucian students (儒生). Even common men and women in the alleys who had never personally encountered the Master's presence mourned his passing, and some refrained from eating meat for several days. This shows how deeply the Master's noble character and benevolent virtue permeated the community.

Prior to this, realizing his remaining days were few, on Pyŏngsin day, five days before his passing (易簀), he ordered his disciples to carefully return borrowed books. <74> The next day, Chŏngyu, he ordered his nephew Nyŏng (寗) to write down his last instructions: "(1) Decline the state funeral (禮葬). (2) Do not erect a stele before the grave; instead, use a small stone and write on its front: 'T'oedo Manŭn Chin Sŏng Yi Kong chi Myo' (退陶晩隱眞城李公之墓, The Grave of Master Yi of Chin Sŏng, Retired Late to T'oedo). After that, briefly describe the hometown, lineage, aspirations, conduct, and career, as stated in the Family Rites (家禮). However, if this relies on another person's composition, someone like Ki Kobong (奇高峰) would surely embellish things without factual basis, inviting ridicule from the world. Therefore, I once intended to briefly state my aspirations myself. I only drafted the epitaph (銘文) but did not complete the rest; the draft might be hidden among messy papers. It is acceptable to find and use that epitaph." On the final day, the 8th, in the morning, he ordered an attendant to water the potted plum tree, then had his bedding arranged neatly, asked the attendant, "Help me sit up," and calmly closed his eyes while sitting quietly.

The Master's remains were buried on the southern slope of Ch'ŏnji Mountain (洓芝山) in Yean in the 3rd month of the following year, when the spring grass was about to turn green again. His son Chun (寯), following the last instructions, submitted a memorial strongly declining the state funeral but could not prevent it. Only the grave inscription followed the instructions: "T'oedo Manŭn Chin Sŏng Yi Kong chi Myo" (退陶晩隱眞城李公之墓). Later, in Kapsul year, through the initiative of local Confucian scholars, the Master's academy (書院) was built south of Tosan, and memorial rites were held in spring and autumn. Subsequently, in Pyŏngja year, the court granted him the posthumous name Munsun (文純). (Extensive knowledge of morality and learning is called Mun 文; upholding centrality and correctness, being pure and refined is called Sun 純).

Only seen in the Master—that character and those words and actions!!!

Regarding the Master's thought, the reporter cannot casually comment now, nor does he intend to. However, what the reporter cannot help but deeply admire and feel irrepressibly moved by towards the Master are his pure and sincere character and his faithful words and actions. This character, these words and actions, are truths that can only be seen and felt in the Master. It is truly regrettable that the reporter's acquaintance with the Master's writings is recent and the available space is limited, preventing a full depiction of his noble character and the true face of his words and actions. Nevertheless, here is a glimpse:

His Diligent Effort and Precision

Cho Mok (趙穆), one of the Master's disciples, began his comprehensive record of the Master's words and actions by stating that the Master possessed "genius-level insight and clarity of spirit" (天才穎悟, 神彩精明). However, this is merely a polite phrase used by a disciple in reverence of his teacher. Speaking factually, the Master's innate disposition was not particularly brilliant or sharp; he is observed to have been predominantly a person of warm, respectful, pure, and refined character. <75> Therefore, the Master becoming the Master he was depended less on his innate genius and more on his incomparable diligent effort and precision. Considering what appears in the *T'oegye Munjip* (退溪文集, Collected Works of T'oegye) and *T'oegye Ŏnhaengnok* (退溪言行錄, Record of T'oegye's Words and Actions), compiled from his disciples' notes:

When the Master first learned the Thousand Character Classic from the neighborhood elder at age six, every morning he would wash his face, comb his hair, and upon reaching the gate, quietly recite the previous lesson several times before entering, bowing respectfully to receive instruction as if before a strict teacher. (Annals 1)

After the Master obtained the Complete Works of Zhu Xi (朱子全書) in the capital, he secluded himself for quiet contemplation, continuing through the summer without interruption. When someone cautioned, "What if you fall ill in this summer heat?" the Master replied, "When I delve into this text, I suddenly feel a cool energy stir in my chest, so I am unaware of the heat." (Kim Sŏngil's Record 金誠一記)

There was a handwritten copy of Zhu Xi's works (朱子書寫本) in the Master's house, where the characters were nearly worn away; this was because the Master had read it so much. (Ibid.)

In the winter of Shinyu year, when the Master resided at Wan'ujae (玩憂齋), he would rise at cockcrow and invariably recite a passage solemnly. Listening closely, it was the Classic of the Mind with Annotations (心經附註). (Ibid.)

The Master once said, "In my youth, I set my mind on this learning and worked tirelessly day and night without sleep. As a result, I acquired a chronic illness and could not avoid becoming an invalid. Learners should rightly study according to their energy levels." (Yi Tŏkhong's Record 李德弘記)

Despite his advancing age and worsening illness, the Master exerted himself even more in advancing his studies and pursuing the Way. Every day, he rose before dawn, invariably washed, combed his hair, put on his cap and robes, read books all day, or sometimes sat quietly burning incense, constantly examining his mind. (Kim Sŏngil's Record 金誠一記)

When the Master read books, he would always sit upright and recite solemnly, seeking the meaning of phrases and exploring their significance, not overlooking even the slightest detail of a character or stroke. He always said, "The essential point of reading is to embody the words and actions of the sages in one's heart, contemplate them deeply, and only then will there be the achievement of cultivating oneself and advancing in learning." He also said, "Use Yi Yŏnp'yŏng's (李延平) 'method of quietly sitting, clarifying the mind, and embodying heavenly principle' (黙坐澄心軆認天理之說) as the way to read books and investigate principle." (Ibid.)

Teaching Tirelessly

Just as the Master diligently pursued self-cultivation, he devoted his entire energy to imparting his beliefs and insights to others. The fact that the Master personally established the Tosan Sŏdang (陶山書堂) and created works like the Ten Diagrams on Sage Learning (聖學十圖), the Diagram of the Mind Integrating Nature and Feelings (心統性情圖), and the New Diagram of the Heavenly Mandate (天命新圖) were all expressions of his sincere desire to succeed the sages of the past and enlighten future scholars. His numerous verbal and written exchanges with figures like Ki Myŏngŏn (奇明彦, Ki Taesŭng) and Kim Ijŏng (金而精) discussing his unique belief in the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings (四端七情), ultimately leading Ki to abandon his own beliefs and accept the Master's view, is another example. <76> The extent of the Master's sincerity in teaching can be fully glimpsed from his later years. Despite reaching the advanced age of seventy, with his chronic illness worsening daily and his energy often failing, in the 5th month of that year, he went to Tosan and lectured on the *Enlightenment for Beginners* (啓蒙) with various students. In the 7th month, he went to Yidong Sŏwŏn (易東書院) and lectured on the *Classic of the Mind* (心經) with students. In the 9th month, he again lectured on the *Enlightenment for Beginners* and the *Classic of the Mind* at Tosan. In the 10th month, he wrote to Ki Myŏngŏn discussing the Diagram of Mind and Nature (心性圖). In the 11th month, he sent a letter to Ki Myŏngŏn confessing that his previous explanation regarding the extension of knowledge and the investigation of things (致知格物) was mistaken and described his newly researched understanding. Four days before his passing, on the 4th day of the 12th month, disregarding the dissuasion of his disciples, he received various students and bid them a final farewell (his farewell words included: "Discussing my mistaken views with you gentlemen all day has not been an easy matter 平日以謬見 與諸君終日講論亦不易事"). The Master's profound sincerity towards others truly reached its peak at this time. Briefly recording the Master's teaching methods as seen through his disciples' eyes:

The Master instructed later scholars without tiring or growing weary. He treated them like friends and never assumed the position of a teacher. When scholars came from afar, he guided them according to their depth of understanding, always emphasizing establishing one's will (立志) as the first priority, and making reverence (主敬) and investigating principle (窮理) the starting point for effort. He patiently guided and enlightened them until they understood. (Kim Sŏngil's Record 金誠一記)

He often said, "While not learning the higher things first (不學上達) is indeed the usual sequence, if a learner makes no progress for a long time, there is a risk of giving up midway. Thus, it is best to point out the fundamental starting point." (Chŏng Yuil's Record 鄭惟一記)

He often said, "In learning, investigating principle (窮理) is crucial. If one is unclear about principle, one will encounter obstacles everywhere, whether reading books or dealing with affairs." (U Sŏngjŏn's Record 禹性傳記)

"My temperament (氣質) has biases; what should I do?" He replied, "Only by being clear about principle can this be avoided." (Yi Tŏkhong's Record 李德弘記)

In the first month of Sinhae year, when I saw the Master at T'oegye, he taught me all day. It was all valuable advice concerning lack of firm resolve (立志不篤) and actions not matching words (行不顧言). (Cho Ch'am's Record 趙穇記)

In Shinyu year, when I first met the Master and requested instruction, he taught, "Sincerity (誠) is the gateway to the Way. One must act with sincerity, and then there will be no interruption." He then gave me the name Sach'ŏng (士誠) and the courtesy name Chamyŏng (子明), writing them down himself. (Chŏng Sach'ŏng's Record 鄭士誠記)

Always Humble, Never Self-Possessed

Despite his learning advancing daily and his understanding of the Way becoming ever clearer, the Master always felt dissatisfied and inadequate. In dealing with people and discussing matters, he particularly valued humility. Even when presenting his own well-founded opinions, he would merely say, "In my foolish opinion (愚意), it seems to be like this; what is your esteemed opinion (貴意)?" <77> When he discovered errors in the classics he was reading, he would invariably make a note in the margin, saying only, "Character X seems suspicious, it should likely be character Y (某字는 疑當作某字)," never directly correcting it. The Master's instructions to his disciples at his deathbed to decline the state funeral, forbid the erection of a stele, and compose his own epitaph to prevent others' exaggerated praise were all manifestations of his humble virtue. Here are brief accounts from his disciples:

When the Master discussed matters with scholars, he did not insist on his own views but always gathered various opinions broadly. Even the words of commentators on minor phrases or humble scholars (章句鄙儒) were listened to attentively. During debates, his demeanor was calm, his words smooth, his reasoning clear, and his meaning correct. Even when many voices arose competing, he did not interject his own words but always waited until one side's argument was settled before offering a single statement to analyze it point by point, never insisting he was right, but merely saying, "My humble view is thus, I do not know how it seems [to you] (鄙見如此未知如何)." (Kim Sŏngil's Record 金誠一記)

He once said, "Being unable to yield one's own view to follow others (舍己從人) is a great failing for learners. The principles of righteousness under Heaven (天下의 義理) are boundless; how can one possibly think oneself always right and others wrong?" (U Sŏngjŏn's Record 禹性傳記)

When the Master spoke with people, if their words were reasonable, he would respond affirmatively. If they were inappropriate, he would remain silent and not reply, yet people naturally respected and loved the Master. (Yi Tŏkhong's Record 李德弘記)

Mountains Stand Tall, Water Flows Deep

"Not striving eagerly for what is noble, nor grieving sorrowfully over poverty and lowliness (不汲汲於當貴하며 不戚戚於貧賤)" is a saying of Qian Lou (黔婁) that T'ao Yuanming (陶淵明) applied to himself. The Master not only did not strive eagerly for wealth and honor but vigorously declined them; he not only did not grieve over poverty and lowliness but delighted in them. Thus, after passing the Sama examination, he had no further ambition for advancement. He reluctantly took office to support his elderly mother, eventually reaching high positions, but it was not what he enjoyed. Later, when his elderly mother Lady Pak passed away and the Tosan Sŏdang was completed, he resolutely resigned from office and returned east. He spent his days reading and investigating principle, finding self-expression by climbing mountains and viewing waters. The poems he wrote upon first retiring to T'oegye are sufficient to understand the Master's aspirations. Here are a few stanzas:

"On T'oegye Stream (題退溪)"
Body retired, content with a fool's lot,
Learning retreats, worrying about twilight years.
First settling residence by the stream,
Facing the flow, daily reflections arise.

"On Hansŏ Hermitage (題寒棲菴)" (Hansŏ Hermitage 寒棲菴 was the Master's old house in On'gye-ri)
Binding thatch to make a forest hut,
Below, spring water and rocks flow clearly.
Dwelling here is enjoyable enough,
No regret that none know of it.

"Miscellaneous Musings While Living by the Stream (溪居雜興)"
Bought land beyond the blue mist,
Moved residence beside the green gorge.
Deeply fond only of water and rocks,
Greatly admiring only pines and bamboos.
Watching the seasons unfold in tranquility,
Reviewing past fragrances in leisure.
A brushwood gate suits a remote place,
My heart's affair—a study full of books.

Thus, the Master enjoyed springs and rocks, making reading and investigating principle his occupation. <78> He discussed his research with friends from near and far. Still feeling unsatisfied, he thought of contemporaries and ancients, entrusting boundless lingering thoughts to them. In his poems recalling others (懷人詩), lines like "A lone trace in the world, / Always regretting the scarcity of friends. / Like a crane calling in the shade, / How distant are those who respond. / In empty mountains at year's end, / Singing alone with no companion (孤蹤在世間, 常恨少朋遊. 有如鶴鳴陰, 和者何悠悠. 空山歲暮時, 獨詠無相猶)" and passages in his self-composed epitaph like "I think of the ancients, / Truly finding my heart (我思古人, 實獲我心)" aptly express this sentiment.

In essence, the Master was renowned in his time and later ages less for the excellence of his genius and thought, and more for the warmth and sincerity of his character and the consistency of his words and actions. It was for these reasons he was esteemed in his time and furthermore became the patriarch of Eastern Confucian learning. The Master's self-composed grave epitaph, though brief, is most suitable for understanding his complete persona. I conclude this section by recording his epitaph:

His Self-Composed Epitaph (自銘):
"Born greatly foolish (生而大痴). / Grown, afflicted by many illnesses (壯而多疾). / Midway, how fond of learning (中何嗜學). / Late, how undeservedly granted rank (晩何叨爵). / Learning sought, ever more distant (學求逾邈). / Rank declined, ever more entangled (爵辭逾攖). / Advancing forward, stumbling (進行之跲). / Retiring into hiding, steadfast (退藏之貞). / Deeply ashamed of the state's grace (深慙國恩). / Truly fearing the sage's words (亶畏聖言). / Mountains stand tall (有山嶷嶷). / Water flows deep (有水源源). / Clinging to my original robes (婆婆初服). / Shaking off the crowd's slander (脫略衆訕). / My aspirations are hindered (我懷伊阻). / Whose pendant shall I toy with? (我珮誰玩) / I think of the ancients (我思古人), / Truly finding my heart (實獲我心). / How can I know future generations / Will not find the present [me]? (寧知來世 不獲今兮) / Within sorrow, there is joy (憂中有樂). / Within joy, there is sorrow (樂中有憂). / Following transformation to return to the end (乘化歸盡), / What more is there to seek? (復何求兮)"

A Glimpse into the Thought of the Master, Founder of Our Eastern Neo-Confucianism

I. The Debate on the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings (四端七情論)

The Master's scholarly lineage originates entirely from Zhu Xi (朱子). Although he naturally based his work on the theories of nature and principle (性理說) of Confucius, Mencius, Zengzi, and Zisi, and did not neglect to study the similarities and differences among various schools of thought, he ultimately harmonized everything with Zhu Xi's doctrines. Zhu Xi stated that the Four Beginnings (四端)—commiseration (惻隱), shame and dislike (羞惡), deference and compliance (辭讓), and right and wrong (是非)—are manifestations of principle (理之所發), while the Seven Feelings (七情)—joy (喜), anger (怒), sorrow (哀), pleasure (樂), love (愛), hatred (惡), and desire (慾)—are manifestations of material force (氣之所發). The Master added a layer of more concrete interpretation to this, stating: "The Four Beginnings are principle issuing forth, with material force following it (四端은 理發而氣隨之), and the Seven Feelings are material force issuing forth, with principle riding on it (七情은 氣發而理乘之)." This was the Master's unique, refined theory and the most distinctive contribution among his studies. Regarding this Four-Seven debate (四七論), there were frequent discussions and clarifications with various disciples. His explanations during the debate with Ki Myŏngŏn (奇明彦) are the most detailed, followed by those in the debate with Kim Ijŏng (金而精). Here is the gist of the Master's Four-Seven theory, extracted from these two exchanges:

Initially, Ki Kobong (奇高峰, Ki Myŏngŏn) questioned the Master's Four-Seven theory by letter, arguing that assigning the Four Beginnings to principle and the Seven Feelings to material force <79> implies that principle (理) and material force (氣) are separate entities. Furthermore, stating that the Seven Feelings do not arise from principle and the Four Beginnings do not ride on (乘) material force seemed problematic in its wording. In response, the Master replied in writing, the essence of which is as follows:

"The Four Beginnings are feelings (情也). The Seven Feelings are also feelings (亦情也). Since both are feelings, why do they have the distinct names Four and Seven? Your letter correctly states that it depends on the perspective from which one speaks (所就而言之者不同是也). Indeed, principle and material force fundamentally require each other to form substance (體) and are transmitted to each other to function (用). Certainly, there is no material force without principle, nor is there principle without material force. However, since the perspective from which one speaks differs, distinctions cannot but exist (然 所就而言之不同則亦不容無別). (omitted text) From where do the Four Beginnings issue forth? They issue from the nature of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom (仁義禮智之性). From where do the Seven Feelings issue forth? External things touch one's form (形) and stir within; they emerge depending on circumstances (外物觸其形而動於中綠境而出焉爾). Regarding the issuance of the Four Beginnings, Mencius already called them the mind (心), and the mind is indeed a combination of principle and material force. Yet, why is principle emphasized when referring to them? The nature of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom resides purely within, and these four are their beginnings (端緖). Regarding the issuance of the Seven Feelings, Chengzi (程子) said they issue from within (發於中), and Zhu Xi also said each has its proper object (各 有攸當), so they certainly encompass both principle and material force. Yet, why is material force emphasized when referring to them? When external things arrive, nothing is more easily affected and moved first than the physical form and material force (形氣), and the Seven Feelings are their sprouts (苗脉). (omitted text) Viewed this way, although both are inseparable from principle and material force, if we speak by pointing to what each primarily originates from, then why is it impermissible to say that one is principle and the other is material force (謂之某爲理某爲氣 何不可之有乎)?"

In essence, the Master took Zhu Xi's statement "The Four Beginnings are the issuance of principle; the Seven Feelings are the issuance of material force (四端理之發 七情氣之發)" as the main spirit. He further clarified the state of activation of the Four and Seven: although material force is not entirely uninvolved when the Four Beginnings issue forth, because the Four Beginnings arise from the pure nature of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom, principle is primary (主), and material force follows (隨) it. Similarly, although principle is not absent when the Seven Feelings stir, because they arise initially from external things touching the physical form, material force is primary (主), and principle rides (乘) on it. Therefore, strictly speaking, neither the Four Beginnings nor the Seven Feelings are unrelated to both principle and material force. However, speaking by pointing to what is primary, the Four Beginnings are the issuance of principle, with material force following, and the Seven Feelings are the issuance of material force, with principle riding on it.

II. Principle and Material Force are Not One Thing (理氣非一物)

Prior to T'oegye, Sŏ Hwadam (徐花潭), discussing principle and material force, argued: "One material force naturally contains duality (一氣自含二), the Great Ultimate readily encompasses duality (太一便涵二), oneness cannot but generate duality (一不得不生二), duality naturally enables generation and overcoming (二自能生克). From its subtlety to its surging state, material force's generation and overcoming cause it (氣之自微以至鼓盪, 其生克使之也)." And also: "Outside material force, there is no principle; principle is the controller of material force (氣外無理 理者氣之宰也). What is called controller does not come from outside to control; it refers to that which maintains the functioning of material force, enabling it not to lose its inherent correctness (所謂宰非自外來而宰之 持其氣之用事, 能不失所以然之正者而謂之宰)." Thus, he asserted that principle is merely a term referring to a kind of function in the transformation of material force, not a real entity, and that the birth, death, and transformation of all things in heaven and earth are entirely caused by the single material force (一氣). This theory, as Hwadam himself stated, was indeed strange and wondrous (奇乎奇, 妙乎妙) and greatly influenced the intellectual world of the time. However, Master T'oegye fundamentally rejected this monism of material force (唯氣說), <80> arguing that "Principle is not the functioning of material force, but distinctly separate from material force (理는 氣의 用事가 아니라 氣와는 判然한 別物)," and composed a refutation titled "Principle and Material Force Are Not One Thing (非理氣爲一物)" to counter it. However, this refutation contains little original explanation of his own thought. It mainly quotes passages from Zhu Xi's reply to Liu Shuwen (劉叔文), such as "Principle and material force are decidedly two things. But when viewed within things, the two things are merged and cannot be separated, each residing in one place. However, this does not preclude the two things from each being a distinct thing. If viewed from the perspective of principle, even before there are things, the principle of things already exists. Yet, there is only their principle; these things have not yet actually existed (理與氣 決是二物 但在物上看則 二物渾淪, 不可分開 各在一處 然 不害二物之各爲一物也 若在理上看則雖未有物而已 有物之理然亦但有其理而已 未嘗實有是物也)." He used these quotes to criticize Hwadam's theory of the oneness of principle and material force as entirely inconsistent with the sayings of ancient sages and worthies, further lamenting that Hwadam, despite dedicating his life to this matter, ultimately failed to penetrate even the single character 'principle' (理). While one cannot hastily judge the rightness or wrongness of these two Masters' arguments, one can see a fundamental difference in their attitudes at the foundation of their respective doctrines. That is, Hwadam, when presenting his original research, used the words of former sages as a means of substantiation. In contrast, T'oegye, from the beginning, centered his approach on the doctrines of former sages, daring only to append his own beliefs. This is why, in modern Chosŏn Confucianism, Hwadam's doctrines were almost labeled heretical, while T'oegye's lineage came to dominate the entire country.

III. Theory of the Mind Integrating Nature and Feelings (心統性情說) and Theory of the Diagram of the Heavenly Mandate (天命圖說)

Thus, while viewing principle and material force as strictly two separate entities, the Master stated, "Material force becomes the physical form (形), and principle is equipped within it (理가 그 中에 具하며). This principle and material force combine to become the mind (心), which governs the entire body. The principle said to be equipped within is namely nature (性), and that which issues forth from nature is feelings (情)." He asserted that the mind unifies nature and feelings, eventually drawing the Diagram of the Mind Integrating Nature and Feelings (心統性情圖) to explain its meaning. This diagram consists of three parts: upper, middle, and lower. As the Master himself answered King Myŏngjong's inquiry, this diagram was not entirely his own creation but a revised version based on Cheng Fuxin's (程復心) diagram in the *Si shu zhang tu* (四書章圖), to which he added his own ideas for verification. Although largely citing the principle-material force theories of Confucius, Mencius, Cheng, and Zhu, the New Diagram of the Heavenly Mandate (新天命圖) and its accompanying ten sections of explanation most clearly present the Master's cosmology and view of human life.
The explanation of the diagram discusses: Section 1, "The Principle of Heavenly Mandate (天命之理)"; Section 2, "The Material Force of the Five Agents (五行之氣)"; Section 3, "The Distinction between Principle and Material Force (理氣之分)"; Section 4, "The Origin of Living Things (生物之原)"; Section 5, "The Differences between Humans and Other Creatures (人物之殊)"; Section 6, "The Endowment of the Human Mind (人心之具)"; Section 7, "The Categories of Nature and Feelings (性情之目)"; Section 8, "Intention, Incipience, Good, and Evil (意幾善惡)"; Section 9, "The Endowment of Physical Nature (氣質之禀)"; Section 10, "The Essentials of Preservation and Scrutiny (存省之要)". Although the explanation is quite concise, it is highly systematic and, in a general sense, can be seen as a grand synthesis and exposition of the entire philosophy of traditional Confucianism. <81> (This Diagram of the Heavenly Mandate was completed while the Master was in the capital, revising Chŏng Kong Chiun's (鄭公之雲) old Diagram of the Heavenly Mandate). For the reader's convenience in research, the full text will be presented in the next issue of this magazine.

IV. Reverence for Orthodox Learning, Rejection of Heterodoxy (崇正學, 排異端)

Throughout his life, the Master immersed himself in the writings of Zhu Xi, making Zhu Xi his lifelong model, much like Confucius regarded the Duke of Zhou.
Therefore, within the Learning of the Way (道學), he considered only Zhu Xi's teachings as orthodox (正學). He absolutely rejected any Daoist or other teachings that contradicted Zhu Xi's views, criticizing them either through written refutations or verbally. He drafted the "Refutation of the Mind Having No Substance or Function (卽心無軆用辯)" to rebut the theory of Yi Yŏnbang (李蓮坊), a follower of Sŏ Hwadam, that the mind lacks substance and function. He drafted the "Refutation of Principle and Material Force Being One Thing (非理氣爲一物辨證)" to reject Sŏ Hwadam's monism of material force. He drafted the "Critique of Paeksa's Poetic Teachings (白沙詩敎辨)" to argue that Paeksa's (白沙) poetic teachings had no precedent in the Sage's school (聖門). He drafted the "Critique of the Record of Instructions (傳習錄論辨)" (*Ch'ŏnsŭmnok* 傳習錄, recorded sayings of Wang Yangming by his disciples) to reject Wang Yangming's (王陽明) doctrine of seeking only within the mind (只求諸心說) and the unity of knowledge and action (知行合一說). He deemed Cho Nammyeong's (曹南冥) views to be of the same vein as Zhuangzi (莊周) and thus incorrect. He argued that figures like Ch'oe Kowun (崔孤雲), who merely valued literary skill and flattered Buddhism, should not be enshrined in the Confucian temple (文廟), as it would insult the former sages. He once said, "I wished to read Buddhist scriptures to ascertain their heterodoxy, but I fear that, like someone testing the depth of water who ends up drowning, such a misfortune might occur, so I refrain (내가 佛經을 閱하야써 그 邪道임을 覈코저 하나 正히 涉水者가 其 水의 深淺을 試코저 하다가 마츰내 沒溺의 患을 當함과 가튼 일이 잇슬가 慮하야 此를 不果하노라)." He also said, "Scholars need only read the books of the sages and worthies; that is sufficient. As for heterodox writings, it is perfectly acceptable to be entirely ignorant of them (學者는 다못 聖賢의 書를 讀하얏스면 그뿐이요 異端文字와 如함은 全然不知하야도 是可)." (Kim Sŏngil's handwritten record 金誠一手記). These statements show how strongly the Master rejected learning outside of Confucianism—nay, outside of Zhu Xi's school. Furthermore, he strictly forbade practices like shamanic rituals and prayers (巫覡祈禱), even instructing his disciples on his deathbed to prohibit any form of prayer.
[Note] The full text of "Paeksa's Poetic Teachings" mentioned in this section is: "Without receiving oral transmission from a master, there is ultimately no way to achieve self-enlightenment (不得師傳口授終無自悟之理). Wu Caolu (吳草廬) also said, 'By whispering guidance into the ear, even an illiterate commoner can be instantly brought to wondrous subtlety (提耳而誨之 可使不識一字之凡夫 立造神妙).'"

Chosŏn Confucianism and the Master's Position

The origins of Chosŏn Confucianism can be traced far back to the Kija Chosŏn (箕子朝鮮) era before the birth of Confucius. However, in reality, not only during Kija's time but down through the Three Kingdoms period—even into the Koryŏ period—Confucian culture in Chosŏn had little worth mentioning. This was naturally due to the generally undeveloped state of humanities in ancient times and the flourishing of Buddhist culture in the medieval period. Towards the end of the Koryŏ Dynasty, as a reaction against the extreme prosperity of Buddhism, there were movements for Confucian revival led by figures like An Mun Sŏng (An Yu 安裕) and Paek Ijŏng (白頤正), but they were minor and inconspicuous. <82> The person who notably aimed for the import of Confucian culture into Chosŏn and spearheaded the movement for its establishment was Chŏng P'oŭn (鄭圃隱, Chŏng Mongju). He primarily studied the teachings of Cheng Yi, Cheng Hao, and Zhu Xi (程朱) and delivered eloquent lectures at the National Academy (大學). There was no one among the listeners who did not acknowledge his correctness, earning him the epithet "Bright Wind and Clear Moon" (光風霽月). Particularly, his great loyalty and filial piety, sacrificing his life for the country, became an object of eternal reverence, making his learning of the Way and righteous conduct the powerful backbone of Confucianism, giving him the appearance of the patriarch of Eastern Learning of the Way (東方道學). Chŏng passed his Way to Kil Yaŭn (吉冶隱, Kil Chae 吉再), Yaŭn to Kim Kangho (金江湖, Kim Sukcha 金淑滋), Kangho to his son Chŏmp'ilchae (佔畢齋, Kim Chongjik 金宗直), Chŏmp'ilchae to Kim Hanwŏndang (金寒喧堂, Kim Koengp'il 金宏弼), Hanwŏndang to Chŏng Ildu (鄭一蠹, Chŏng Yŏch'ang 鄭汝昌), and Ildu to Cho Chŏngam (趙靜庵, Cho Kwangjo 趙光祖). However, Chŏngam, with his exceptional talent and outstanding capacity, stood in the court, took upon himself the implementation of the Kingly Way (王道), and worked day and night for governmental reform. Unfortunately, he fell victim to the Kimyo Literati Purge (己卯士禍) and met the whims of fate at the age of 39 in exile in Nŭngju (綾州). From then on, Chosŏn Confucianism took Master T'oegye as its orthodox lineage, through which its branches spread and its flowers bloomed. If we center on T'oegye and show the subsequent connections in the Learning of the Way, it can be represented as follows. [Diagram/Lineage chart presumably followed here in the original magazine, but is not included in the text provided].

Furthermore, the Master's Learning of the Way crossed the distant Genkai Sea (玄海, Korea Strait) and was revered by Japanese Confucian scholars. In Japan, many schools adopted T'oegye as their lineage. Consequently, the Master's thought and deeds became known to a large part of the Japanese population, leading them to acknowledge that Chosŏn essentially had only the Master.

Conclusion

The Master's temperament (性度) was warm and sincere, pure like jade. <83> From childhood, he loved learning, often seeming to forget sleep and rest. He particularly immersed himself in Zhu Xi's writings, grasping the essence of Confucianism therein. Believing that learning must be for oneself, he prioritized preserving the mind, nourishing nature (存心養性), and sought to practice what he learned in daily affairs. In terms of official career, his positions were high, and his advancements and retreats were frequent. However, knowing his preferences and strengths did not lie there, the Master did not enjoy it from the start. Later, when Yi Ki (李芑) held power and corrupt factions grasped control, he resolutely returned to his hometown, retired to Tosan, and devoted himself solely to lecturing on this learning and enlightening later generations. He had a particular fondness for forests and springs, sometimes alone, sometimes with relatives and disciples, exploring nearby and distant waters and stones, composing poems about his feelings. During the late reign of King Myŏngjong and the early reign of King Sŏnjo, the court's summons for the Master became increasingly urgent. Although he generally declined, earnestly explaining the reasons why he could not accept office, his loyal heart, loving the king and the country, never ceased for a day. If he heard of a failure in court administration, worry would invariably show on his face; if he heard of a successful measure, joy would invariably appear. Regarding his writings, although there are no major comprehensive works, the large volume of correspondence discussing matters with his various disciples, along with essays like refutations (辨), discussions (論), and expositions (說), exhibit solemn argumentation and fluent prose, truly retaining the quality of treasures. The six-volume *Record of Words and Actions* (言行錄), compiled from his disciples' notes, truly deserves to be a timeless book of self-cultivation. The way the Master maintained his faith in the Way, becoming ever more devoted, loved learning, becoming ever more diligent, and continued discussions with disciples and followers until just days before his passing, preserving the sincerity of a true scholar to the end, truly serves as an eternal model worthy of admiration by all under Heaven. In essence, as Yulgok (栗谷) pre-assessed, the Master might not have matched Chŏngam (靜庵) in talent and capacity (才調器局), but in his tireless learning and unwavering practice, profoundly investigating righteousness and principle (義理) and conducting his affairs with steadfast integrity (貞篤), he was a great philosopher whom few from antiquity could reach.

Regarding the Master's character and his words and actions, we of later generations truly cannot say much, only feel overwhelming admiration. However, concerning his thought and research, this reporter, for one, has some reflections. Namely, as already stated, the Master directly inherited Zhu Xi's doctrines. At the same time, if we consider that the Master synthesized the thought of contemporary Confucian scholars, this synthesis was centered on Zhu Xi's thought. Zhu Xi's thought represented the thought of Song dynasty Confucians (宋儒). Song Confucian thought arose as a reaction against the prevalence of Buddhist and Daoist thought (佛老) since the Eastern Han dynasty in China. Consequently, that thought itself contained a tendency towards narrowness, attacking differences and embracing only similarities. That Song Confucian thought leaned somewhat towards narrowness <84> is commonly acknowledged today.
Yet, the Master inherited the thought of Zhu Xi, one of these Song Confucians, and transmitted that thought and attitude directly to later scholars. The result, over the four hundred years from the Master until today, has been to bias the research of Chosŏn Confucian scholars towards one aspect of Confucian thought—and even within that, only towards what had already been manifested. Furthermore, it cannot be denied that this fostered the narrow-minded and petty scholarly habit of factionalism, siding with allies and attacking opponents (黨同伐異).
This tendency arguably appeared even within the Master's own thought or attitude. For instance, statements like, "I wished to read Buddhist scriptures to ascertain their heterodoxy, but I fear that, like someone testing the depth of water who ends up drowning, such a misfortune might occur, so I refrain," are really just attacks made for the sake of attacking. Also, when refuting the theories of Hwadam, Wang Yangming, and others, rather than demolishing their errors with his own unique reasoning, his refutations often merely cite fragments from Confucius, Mencius, Cheng, and Zhu, arguing, "The ancient sages' words are thus, so that assertion is wrong," or "It is close to Buddhism, so it is wrong." This arguably fostered a habit in later scholars of arguing not through reason (理致) but merely by invoking the words of sages. Of course, the Master did so based on his own understanding, and it was also an expression of his noble character, passionate about his beliefs and learning; thus, one cannot directly criticize the Master himself. However, the extreme reverence later scholars held for the Master, considering him the orthodox lineage, ironically led to such subsequent弊害 (ill effects). Alas.

Reporter's Note: One cannot lightly take up the pen regarding the Master's thought, words, and actions. Moreover, his collected works alone amount to forty-nine volumes. Such limited investigation cannot even sketch an outline of the Master's thought or conduct. Due to responsibility, I have proceeded thus first; any errors found will be corrected. Finally, I believe that this Master's warm, sincere, and steadfast character, and the words and actions emanating from that character, will shine eternally like the sun and moon. With that, I lay down my pen. <85>

**Summary**

This 1921 article from *Kaebyŏk* magazine introduces Yi T'oegye (Yi Hwang) as one of Chosŏn's ten great men, focusing on his life, character, and key philosophical contributions, particularly his development of Zhu Xi's Neo-Confucianism. It details his biography, emphasizing his diligent study habits, humility, integrity despite holding high office, and dedication to teaching disciples even in old age. The article explains his influential Four-Seven Debate theory (distinguishing principle and material force in emotions), his defense of Zhu Xi's dualism against Sŏ Hwadam's monism, and his synthesis of Confucian thought in diagrams like the *Diagram of the Mind Integrating Nature and Feelings*. While deeply revering T'oegye's character and influence as the "patriarch" of Korean Neo-Confucianism, the author concludes with a critique, suggesting T'oegye's strict adherence to Zhu Xi and rejection of other schools (including Buddhism and Wang Yangming) contributed to a certain narrowness and factionalism (黨同伐異) in later Chosŏn Confucianism.

From a historical perspective, this article is interesting as it reflects early 20th-century Korean nationalist sentiment attempting to establish a pantheon of "great men" during the Japanese colonial period. The reverence for T'oegye is palpable, but the critical concluding remarks about the potential negative legacies of his thought (narrowness, factionalism) are noteworthy, perhaps reflecting a modernizing intellectual's subtle questioning of traditional Confucian orthodoxy's limitations in the face of contemporary challenges. The mention of T'oegye's influence in Japan also subtly positions Korea as a source of high culture for its colonizer.

東方理學의 宗祖인 李退溪先生, 朝鮮十大偉人紹介의 其二
爲先 先生의 一生을 簡記하면
先生의 姓은 李요 名은 滉이오 字는 景浩요 貫은 眞寶요 號는 退溪요 또는 陶叟(嘗卜居退溪, 因自號退溪. 後搆書堂於陶山, 自號陶叟)니 李朝 燕山君 7年(距今 420年前이며 明, 孝宗弘治 14年) 辛酉 11月 25日 慶尙道 禮安縣 溫溪里(今 慶北 安東郡 陶山面 溫惠里)에서 첫 울음소리를 내엇다. 그 家系는 처움부터 相當하야 六世祖碩은 일즉이 高麗朝에 仕하야 司馬의 選에 預하얏스며 其 祖繼陽과 其 父埴은 共히 成均館 進士로 當時 儒林의 知名者이엇섯다. 先生은 生後 不過 半歲에 其 父를 失하고 母 夫人朴氏의 嚴格한 敎養미테서 자라낫는데 일즉이 6歲 時에 隣家 老夫에게 나아가 千字文을 學하얏스며 12歲 時에는 그 叔父 堣(號 松齋)에게 나아가 論語를 學한 中 性質이 別로 溫恭沈着한 先生은 이때부터 百物에 나아가면 반듯이 窮理하기를 始하얏다. 一日은 理字를 가지고 그 叔父 松齋에게 무러 가르되 「凡事之是者-是理乎이까」하매 松齋 가르되 그러하다 네가 벌서 文義를 解하느냐 하야 그의 非凡을 驚嘆하며 매양 가르되 吾家의 門戶를 빗내일 者-반듯이 此 兒가 되리라 하얏다 한다. 先生의 讀書熱은 그 後 날로 甚하야 14歲 時부터는 비록 稠人廣坐中이라도 반듯이 向壁潛玩하얏스며 別로 淵明 詩를 耽讀하야 그의 爲人을 愛慕하얏나니 先生의 18歲되던 春에 偶然히 燕谷(近溫溪)에 散步하다가 小池의 淸淨을 吟味한「露草天天繞水涯, 小塘淸活淨無沙, 雲飛鳥過元相管, 只怕時時燕蹴波」의 詩를 보면 그윽히 淵明의 田園詩를 聯想케 되는 同時에 벌서 그 때부터 天理人欲의 問題에 想到함이 만핫슴을 엿볼 수가 잇다.＜73＞ 19歲 時에 처음 朱子의 性理大全을 읽어 心悅眼開의 깃븜을 스스로 不覺하얏스며 20歲에 周易을 읽어 其  義를 講究하되 자못 終日不輟하며 終夜不寐한 바 크게 身軆의 健康을 傷하야 先生의 말슴을 빌어써 말하면 그만 一生의 痼疾을 어덧다. 21歲에 夫人 許氏를 聘하고 그 翌年에 始로 漢城의 大學에 遊하얏는데 때는 己卯의 士禍를 經하야 士習이 浮薄한 바 先生의 擧止有度함을 보고 돌이어 誹笑한 者가 만핫고 오즉 金麟厚 한 사람이 先生과 相從할 뿐이엇다. 先生은 그 後 더욱 刻工하야 28歲에 進士가 되고 33歲에 登第하야 承文院 正字가 되고 그後 累進하야 戶曹佐郞, 司諫院 正言, 弘文館 校理, 世子侍講院文學, 成均館 大司成僉知中樞府使, 工曹叅判 等을 歷任하얏스며 66歲 時에는 工曹判書兼 大提學을 除命하얏스나 力辭還鄕하얏스며 翌年 丁卯에는 明國의 嘉靖帝가 崩하고 新帝가 繼位하야 詔使가 將至할 터인바 朝廷에서 이에 對한 酬應을 備키 爲하야 先生을 召함으로 應命入都하얏는데 그때에 明宗이  昇遐하고 宣祖가 嗣位하야 禮祖判書를 拜하얏스나 病으로써 辭하고 곳 東歸하얏스며 그해 10月과 그 翌年 正月에 또한 召命이 잇슴으로 具疏力辭하얏스나 다시 敎書로써 上來를 促함으로 不得已 闕에 나아가 辭意를 親述하고 聖學十圖를 들이엇스며 大提學과 吏曹判書를 更拜하얏스나 또한 固辭하얏고 69歲되든 己巳 3月에 겨우 朝廷의 允許를 바다 鄕里에 돌아와 그 翌年 70歲되든 庚午 正月에 글을 올려 致仕를 빌어스나 우으로부터 强히 許치 아니하엿스며 그 後 3月, 4月, 9月에 3次이나 致仕를 빌어스나 또한 允許치 아니하얏다. 이 해 11月에는 先生의 健康이 異常히 衰하야 여러 子弟와 門人은 그 겻을 떠나지 아니하던 中 鳴呼 12月 8日 夜에 先生은 永遠한 沈黙에 들고 말앗다. 이 訃音이 한번 門밧글 나매 當時 主上끠 서는 親히 政院에 나사『李滉의 死去는 내가 甚히 通悼하는 바라』하고 大匡輔國崇祿大夫議政府領議政兼 領經筵弘文舘 藝文舘 春秋館 觀象監事를 追贈하고 近臣 2人을 差遺하야 致吊致祭하얏고 遠近吊客이  連日踏至하야 會葬者가 士大夫와 儒生만으로 300餘 人에 達하얏스며 일즉 先生의 謦咳에 接치 못한 巷間의 男女까지도 다 그의 死去를 通悼하야 累日 고기를 먹지 아니한 者가 잇섯나니 先生의 高風仁德이 얼마나 四隣에 淶洽하얏는가를 알 수 잇도다.
이에 先하야 先生은 그 餘日이 無多함을 스스로 생각하고 易簀하기 5日 前되는 丙申에 子弟를 命하야 他人의 書籍을 精히 돌러 보내게 하고＜74＞ 그 翌日 丁酉에 兄子寗을 命하야 遺戒를 쓰게 하되『(一)禮葬을 辭할 것, (二)墓前에는 碑石을 세우지 말고 다못 小石으로써 그 前面에 쓰되「退陶晩隱眞城李公之墓」』라 하고 그 後에『鄕里, 世系, 志行, 出處를 畧敍하되 家禮 中의 所云과 가티 하라. 그런데 이것을 만일 他人의 製述에 依托하면 奇高峰가튼 이가 반듯이 實地 업는 일을 張遑하야써 世上에 웃음을 取하겟는 故로 일즉 내가 스스로 所志를 簡述코저 하얏더니 다못 銘文을 先製하고 其 餘를 未畢한 바 그 草文이 亂草中에 감추어 잇슬지라. 그 銘을 차자씀이 可하니라』하얏스며 最後의 日되는 8日에는 아츰에 侍人을 命하야 盆梅에 물을 주게 하고 나종으로 臥席을 整頓케 하고 侍人다려 나를 일으켜 안차라 하야 靜坐한 그대로 고요히 눈을 감앗다 한다.
先生의 遺體는 春草가 또 푸르고저 하는 翌年 3月에 禮安 搴芝山南에 葬하얏는데 其 子寯은 遺戒에 依하야 글을 올려 禮葬을 力辭하얏스나 엇지 못하고 다못 墓刻에 뿐 遺戒대로 「退陶晩隱眞城李公之墓」라 하얏다. 其後 甲戌에 一鄕士子의 發議로 先生의 書院을 陶山의 南에 세우고 春秋의 享祀를 行하며 其後 丙子에 朝廷으로서 贈謚하야 曰 文純이라 하다. (道德博聞曰文, 中正精粹曰純)

오즉 先生에게서 볼뿐 그 性格과 그 言行!!!
先生의 思想에 至하야는 記者로서는 이제 가비업게 評論할 수가 업스며 또 評論코저 아니한다. 그러나 記者로서 先生에게 向하야 崇慕하야 마지못하며 또한 咸激하야 抑制할 수 업는 것은 先生의 그 純摯한 性格과 篤實한 言行이니 이 性格, 이 言行이야말로 오즉 先生에게뿐 볼 수 잇스며 느낄 수 잇는 眞實이다. 記者- 先生의 遺書에 接한지 日이 淺하고 또 적을 紙面이 制限이 잇슴으로 그 거룩한 性格과 밋 言行의 眞面을 그대로 쓰게 되지 못함은 實로 遺憾이나 아수운대로 그의 一斑을 적으면 이러하도다.

그의 刻苦精工
先生의 門人의 一人인 趙穆은 先生의 言行을 總錄하는 글의 劈頭에 先生은『天才穎悟, 神彩精明』이라 하얏다. 그러나 이것은 弟子로서 先生을 追慕하야써 敍述하는 禮辭에 不過하며 事實대로 말하면 先生의 天資는 그러틋 穎悟精明한 便이 아니엇스며 主로 溫恭精純한 ＜75＞ 便의 어룬이엇던 줄로 觀察된다. 故로 先生이 先生된 것은 그 先天的의 天才에 依하얏다 함보다 比類업는 先生의 刻苦精工에 依하얏다 함이 可하니 이제 그 門人의 手記로서 成한 退溪文集과 退溪言行錄에 나타난 바로써 考하면
先生이 6歲 時 처음으로 隣家 老夫에게 千字文을 배울 때에 아츰마다 낫 씻고 머리 빗고 문밧게 이르러는 가만히 前課를 두어 번 暗誦한 後에 들어가 俯伏聽受하되 嚴師와 가티 하얏다 하며(年譜一)
先生이 일즉 朱子全書를 都下에서 어든 後로 閉戶靜觀하되 歷夏不輟한대 或이 戒하되 「이 暑熱에 致傷하면 어떠케 할 가」한즉 先生은 對答하되 이 글을 講究한즉 문득 胸中에 凉氣가 動함을 늑기는 바 스스로 그 더움을 아지 못한다 하얏다.(金誠一記)
先生집에 朱子書寫本 一秩이 잇서 字劃이 거의 문히엇는데 이것은 先生이 읽어서 그리됨이러라.(同上)
辛酉 冬에 先生이 玩憂齋에 居하실 새 鷄鳴而起하야는 반듯이 一遍을 莊誦하는데 가만히 들으니 心經附註이러라.(同上)
先生은 일즉 말슴하시되 내 少時에 이 學에 뜻을 두고 終日不輟, 終夜不寐하얏더니 그만 痼疾을 어더 病廢의 人됨을 免치 못하얏스니 學者는 맛당히 氣力을 딸아 工夫함이 可하니라.(李德弘記)
先生은 年齡의 高함과 가티 病은 더욱 깁허감에 不拘하고 進學念道에 더욱 힘을 쓰시사 每日 未明에 起하야 반듯이 盥櫛冠衣하고 終日 觀書하며 或 焚香靜坐하사 恒常 그 마음을 提省하시더라.(金誠一記)
先生이 讀書할 時에는 必正坐莊誦하되 그 訓句를 求하고 밋 意義를 尋하야 一字一劃의 微라도 放過치 아니하시며 每樣 말슴하시되 讀書의 要는 반듯이 聖賢의 言行을 心에 軆하야써 潛求玩黙한 然後에 비롯오 涵養進學의 功이 잇스리라 하시며 又曰 李延平의 「黙坐澄心軆認天理之說」로써 讀書 窮理의 法을 삼으라 하시다.(同上)

敎人不倦
先生은 右와 가티 스스로 精工을 마지아니한 同時에 사람을 爲하야 自己의 所信과 所得을 布施하기에 全誠力을 다하엿다. 先生이 自手로서 陶山書堂을 일으키어 聖學十圖와 心統性情圖와 天命新圖의 그림과 가튼 것은 모다 往聖을 繼하고 來學을 開하는 衷誠의 發露이엇스며 奇明彦金而精等 人에 對하야는 말로써 글로써 數十回의 問答을 重하야써 自己의 唯一所信인 四端七情을 論辨한 바 畢竟은 奇氏도 自己의 所信을 버리고 先生의 所見에 服하게 됨과 가틈도 亦 一例이다.＜76＞ 그리고 先生이 사람을 爲한 眞誠이 如何하얏는가 함은 그 末年의 일로써 足히 全斑을 窺할지니 先生의 高齡이 七旬에 至하야 宿疴가 日로 深하고 氣力이 때로 衰함을 不拘하고 그 해 5月에는 陶山에 나와 諸生으로 더불어 啓蒙을 講하엿스며 7月에는 易東書院에 나아가 諸生으로 더불어 心經을 講하엿스며 9月에는 다시 陶山에서 啓蒙心經을 講하엿스며 10月에는 奇明彦에게 글을 주어서 心性圖를 論하엿스며 11月에는 奇明彦에게 글을 보내어서 致知格物에 대한 自己의 前說이 틀린 것을 告白하고 다시 새로히 硏究한 바를 記하엿스며 易簀하기 4日 前되던 12月 4日에 子弟의 勸止함을 不聽하고 諸生을 引見하사 最後의 訣別(그 訣別의 辭에 曰 平日以謬見 與諸君終日講論亦不易事)을 與하얏나니 先生의 爲人의 至情이 實로 이때 極하얏다 할지라. 이제 簡單히 그 門人의 눈에 비추운 先生의 敎人方을 記하면
先生은 後學을 訓誨하되 不厭不倦하셧스며 待하기를 朋友와 가티 하실 뿐이오. 마츰내 師道로써 自處치 아니하시며 士子들이 遠方으로부터 차자 오거던 그 淺深을 딸아 고하되 반듯이 立志로써 第一을 삼고 主敬窮理로써 用工地頭를 삼게 하시며 諄諄誘掖하사 그를 啓發乃已하시더라.(金誠一記)
恒言하시되 不學上達이 固是常序나 그러나 學者-오래 어듬이 업스면 中廢의 慮가 업지 못한즉 그 本源地頭를 指示함만 갓지 못하니라.(鄭惟一記)
恒言하시되 學은 窮理가 貴하니 理에 밝지 못함이 잇스면 或讀書或遇事에 간대마다 걸님이 잇슬지니라.(禹性傳記)
小子-氣質에 偏處가 잇사오니 어찌 하리이까 가로사되 오즉 理에 밝으면 可히 免할 지니라.(李德弘記)
辛亥 正月에 先生을 退溪에 보인즉 先生이 終日賜敎하섯는데 다 立志不篤과 行不顧言에 貴한 것이엇더라.(趙穇記)
辛酉에 처음 先生을 뵈옵고 業을 請한즉 가르사되 誠은 入道의 門이니 반듯이 誠으로써 한 然後라야 間斷함 업슬지니라 하시고 因히  名을 士誠, 字를 子明이라 하고 手書하야 주시더라.(鄭士誠記)

常謙虛不自有
先生은 그 學이 日進하며 그 道가 益明함에 不拘하고 恒常 스스로 慊然하야 스스로 不足함을 느꼇스며 待人論事에는 特히 謙虛를 是尙하야 自己의 堂堂한 所見을 是陳할 時에도 但曰 「愚意에는 이러할 듯하니 貴意에 如何오」＜77＞ 하엿슬 뿐이며 或 읽는 바 經籍中에서 誤字를 發見할 時는 반듯이 紙頭에 註를 내여서「某字는 疑當作某字」라 할 뿐이오 直히 그를 割正함과 如한 事가 無하얏다. 先生이 臨終에 그 子弟를 戒하야 禮葬을 辭케 하고 立碑를 禁하며 其銘을 自製하야써 他人의 誇讚을 豫防함과 가튼 것은 모다 그 謙德의 發露 아님이 업도다. 이제 그 門人의 所見을 簡記하면
先生이 學者와 가티 講論할 때에는 己見을 不主하고 반듯이 衆論을 博采하사 비록 章句鄙儒의 言이라도 留意潛聽하시며 그 論辨의 際에는 氣和辭暢하며 理明義正하사 群言이 競起할지라도 그 中에 己言을 석지 아니하고 반듯이 彼 一方의 言이 定한 後를 기다려써 一言으로써 條析하시되 반듯이 그로써 올타 아니하시며 但曰 「鄙見如此未知如何」오 하시더라.(金誠一記)
嘗曰 舍己從人치 못함은 學者의 大病이라. 天下의 義理-無窮하거니 어찌 可히 自己만 올히 넉이고 남을 그르다 할 수 잇스리요.(禹性傳記)
先生이 衆人과 더불어 말슴할새 其言이 有理하면 欣然히 應하고 만일 不當하면 잠자코 對答치 아니하시되 衆人이 스스로 先生을 敬愛하더라.(李德弘記)

有山嶷嶷有水源源
不汲汲於當貴하며 不戚戚於貧賤이라 함은 黔屨의 有言으로서 陶淵明이 스스로 비긴 바어니와 先生은 如干富貴에 汲汲치 아니하얏슬 뿐 아니라 富貴를 힘것 辭讓하얏스며 貧賤에 戚戚치 아니하얏슬뿐 아니라 貧賤을 是樂하얏도다. 그래서 한번 司馬의 選에든 이後로부터 다시 榮進을 뜻하지 아니하던 바 老母의 供養을 위하야 黽勉就職하야써 畢竟 顯途에 이르럿스나 그 所樂이 아니엇다. 그後 老母 朴氏가 棄世하고 陶山書堂이 告成함에 미처는 斷然히 棄官歸東하야 讀書窮理로써 날을 저물리고 登山臨水로써 其懷를 自叙하엿다. 처음 退溪에 隱退하면서 쓴 詩는 先生의 志를 窺하기에 足하니 이제 數章을 示하면
「題退溪」身退安愚分, 學退憂暮境, 溪上始定居, 臨流日有省.
「題寒棲菴」結茅爲林廬, 下有泉石寫. 棲遲足可娛, 不恨無知者.(寒棲菴은 溫溪里에 在한 先生의 舊第)
「溪居雜興」買地靑霞外, 移居碧澗傍. 深耽唯水石, 大賞只松篁. 靜裏看時興, 閒中閱往芳, 柴門宜逈處, 心事一書林.
先生은 이와 가티 泉石을 즐기어 讀書窮理를 是業하는 中에＜78＞ 遠近의 知友와 더불어 그 硏究한 바를 對論하며 그래도 不足하야는 스스로 今人 古人을 懷思하야써 無窮한 餘意를 寄하얏나니 그의 懷人詩中 「孤蹤在世間, 常恨少朋遊. 有如鶴鳴陰, 和者何悠悠. 空山歲暮時, 獨詠無相猶」의 句와 그의 自銘中 「我思古人, 實獲我心」等의 節은 正히 這邊의 消息을 說破하얏다 하겟도다.

要컨대 先生은 그 天才와 思想의 卓越함으로써 其當世에 鳴하며 또한 後世에 鳴하얏다 함보다 그 性格의 溫醇과 言行의 一致된 그 點으로써 當世의 重함이 되엇스며 進하야 東方儒學의 祖가 되엇다 할지며 先生의 自製墓銘은 其文이 雖簡하나 先生의 全容을 窺하기에 最適하니 이제 그 自銘을 記하야써 이 項의 끗을 맷는다.
그 自銘에 曰
「生而大痴. 壯而多疾 中何嗜學 晩何叨爵 學求逾邈 爵辭逾攖 進行之跲 退藏之貞 深慙國恩 亶畏聖言 有山嶷嶷 有水源源 婆婆初服 脫略衆訕 我懷伊阻 我珮誰玩 我思古人 實獲我心 寧知來世 不獲今兮 憂中有樂 樂中有憂 乘化歸盡 復何求兮」

我東方 理學의 祖를 成한 先生의 思想一斑
一. 四端七情論
先生의 學統은 其系가 전혀 朱子로 나왓다. 勿論 孔孟曾思의 性理說을 基礎로 하고 百家諸說의 異同을 硏究치 안홈도 아니엇스나 結局은 朱子의 學說에 折衷시키고 마랏다. 朱子는 惻隱, 羞惡, 辭讓, 是非의 四端은 理의 所發이오 喜, 怒, 哀, 樂, 愛, 惡, 慾의 七情은 氣의 所發이라 하얏다. 그던데 先生은 거긔에 一層 具軆的 解釋을 加하야써 「四端은 理發而氣隨之하고 七情은 氣發而理乘之」라 하얏다. 이것이 先生의 唯一 精論이엇스며 先生의 硏究한 것 中에 가장 큰 異彩를 放하는 것이다. 이 四七論에 잇서는 여러 門人과 問答辨解가 頻多한 中 奇明彦과 더불어 論議한 處에 그 說明이 最詳하고 金而精과 論辨한 것이 此에 次하니 이제 이 兩者 中에서 先生의 四七論의 主旨를 摘示하면 이러하다.
처음 奇高峰(奇明彦)으로부터 先生의 四七論에 대하야 以書質疑하되 四端을 理에, 七情을 氣에 分屬케 하면＜79＞ 理와 氣는 서로 別物이 되는 同時에 七情은 理에 나오지 안코 四端은 氣에 태우(乘)지 안는다 함은 語意에 病이 업지 못하다 함에 對하야 先生은 此를 글로써 答辨한 中其要-如左
『四端情也 七情亦情也 均是情也 何以有四七之異名耶 來喩所謂 所就而言之者不同是也 蓋理之與氣 本相須而爲軆, 相傳而爲用 固未有無理之氣 亦未有無氣之理 然 所就而言之不同則亦不容無別 (中略) 四端何從而發乎 發乎仁義禮智之性, 七情何從而發乎 外物觸其形而動於中綠境而出焉爾 四端之發 孟子旣謂之心則 心固理氣之合也 然而所指而言者主於理何也 仁義禮智之性 粹然在中而四者其端緖也 七情之發 程子謂之發於中 朱子亦謂之各 有攸當則固亦兼理氣也 然而所指而言者則在乎氣何也 外物之來 易感而先動者 莫如形氣而七情者其苗脉也 (中畧) 由是觀之 二者雖曰 皆不外乎理氣而 因其所從來 各指其所主而言之則 謂之某爲理某爲氣 何不可之有乎』
要컨대 先生은 朱子의 「四端理之發 七情氣之發」이라 한 것을 主要精神으로 하고 四七의 發動狀態를 一層 明瞭히 說明하되 四端이 發하는 그 中에 氣가 全然히 叅與치 안흠은 아니나 四端은 仁義禮智의 純粹한 性에서 發함이 되는 故로 理가 主가 되고 氣가 그에 隨하며 七情의 움즉이는 中에도 理가 업슴은 아니나 이는 外物이 그 形에 觸함이 有하야 始로 그 中에서 發함인 故로 此는 氣가 主가 되고 理가 此에 乘하는 것이라. 故로 嚴格히 말할 時는 四端七情 中 何者가 理氣의 相關아님이 아니나 그 主되는 바를 指하야써 言하면 四端은 理의 所發로서 氣가 隨함이요 七情은 氣의 所發로서 理가 乘함이라 말슴함이다.

二. 理氣非一物
일즉이 退溪에 先하야 徐花潭은 理氣에 就하야 論하되「一氣自含二, 太一便涵二, 一不得不生二, 二自能生克 氣之自微以至鼓盪, 其生克使之也」라 하고 又曰 「氣外無理 理者氣之宰也 所謂宰非自外來而宰之 持其氣之用事, 能不失所以然之正者而謂之宰」라 하야 理는 氣의 變化上 一種의 作用을 指稱함에 不過함이요 實在는 아니라 하야써 天地萬有의 生滅變化가 全혀 一氣의 所使임을 말하얏다. 이 學說은 花潭先生의 白言함과 如히 果然 奇乎奇, 妙乎妙하야 當時 一般의 思想界에 만흔 影響을 주엇다. 그런데 退溪先生은 此唯氣說을＜80＞ 根本的으로 否認하야 「理는 氣의 用事가 아니라 氣와는 判然한 別物」이라 하며 『非理氣爲一物』이라는 辯證論을 作하야써 이에 對하얏다. 그런데 그 辯證 中에는 別로 自己의 獨創的 思想의 說明은 別로 업고 다못 主로 朱子의 劉叔文에게 對答한 글 中 「理與氣 決是二物 但在物上看則 二物渾淪, 不可分開 各在一處 然 不害二物之各爲一物也 若在理上看則雖未有物而已 有物之理然亦但有其理而已 未嘗實有是物也」등 語句를 引取하야써 花潭의 理氣一物說은 古來聖賢의 說과 全然히 符合되지 아니함을 非難하고 나아가 花潭이 一生을 此事에 用力하얏스나 마츰내 理字 하나도 透得치 못한 것을 可惜타 하얏다. 이 두 先生의 所論에 就하야 문득 是非를 辯할 수 업스나 이 두 先生이 各其 學說을 立하는 根底에 잇서서 根本的 態度의 다름이 잇는 것을 이에서 알 수가 잇다. 即 花潭은 自己의 獨創的 硏究를 發表함에 際하야써 手段으로 先賢의 말을 引來立証하얏슴에 反하야 退溪는 처음부터 先賢의 學說을 中軸으로 하야써 敢히 自己의 所信을 附記코저 하는 態度이엇섯다. 이것이 近代 朝鮮의 儒道에 잇서 花潭의 學說을 거의 異端이라까지 指稱한 것이요 退溪의 學統이 全鮮을 風靡하게 된 것이다.

三. 心統性情說과 天命圖說
先生은 이와 가티 理氣를 嚴格한 二個의 別物로써 보는 同時에 『氣는 形이 되고 理가 그 中에 具하며 이 理氣는 合하야 心이 되어 一身을 主宰한다. 그런데 所謂 그 中에 具하얏다는 理는 即 性이요 그 性으로부터 發用되는 者는 情』이라 하고 心으로써 性情을 統一하는 者라 하야써 듸디어 心統性情圖를 그리어써 其 義를 說하얏다. 이 圖는 上中下의 三으로써 成하얏는데 明宗의 下詢에 對한 先生의 自答과 가티 是圖는 先生의 純然한 創作이 아니요 程復心四書章圖에 잇던 것을 다시 己意를 附하야 考證한 것이엇스며 그리고 大部는 孔孟程朱의 理氣說을 引證하야써 한 것이나 新天命圖와 밋 그에 對한 圖說十節은 先生의 宇宙觀 人生觀을 가장 分明히 提示한 것이라 하겟다.
그 圖說은 第一節에「天命之理」를 論하고 二節에「五行之氣」三節에「理氣之分」四節에 「生物之原」五節에「人物之殊」六節에「人心之具」七節에「性情之目」八節에「意幾善惡」九節에「氣質之禀」十節에「存省之要」를 논하얏는데 其 說이 頗簡하나 심히 系統的이요 一般的인 點에서 從來 儒家의 哲學全軆를 集大成하야 論述한 것이라 볼 수 잇다.＜81＞(이 天命圖는 先生이 都下에 잇슬 때 鄭公之雲의 舊天命圖를 叅訂하야써 完成한 것이며) 讀者 硏究의 便을 爲하야 本誌 來號에 그 全文을 示할가 한다.

四. 崇正學, 排異端
先生은 平生에 朱子書를 耽讀하며 마치 孔子의 周公에 對함과 가티 朱子로써 一生의 目標를 삼앗다.
그래서 道學 中에도 朱子의 學으로써뿐 正學이라 하고 多少라도 그와 反對되는 道學에 至하야는 絶對로 排斥하야 或은 辯證論으로써 或은 口頭로써 그를 非難하얏다. 「卽心無軆用辯」을 草하야써 徐花潭을 從遊하는 李蓮坊의 心無軆用說을 駁하얏스며 「非理氣爲一物辨證」을 草하야써 徐花潭의 唯氣論을 排하얏스며 「白沙詩敎辨」을 草하야써 白沙의 詩敎로써 聖門에 이러한 法이 업다고 論駁하얏스며 「傳習錄論辨」(傳習錄은 王陽明 門人이 그 師說을 記한 者)을 草하야써 王陽明의 只求諸心說과 知行合一說을 排하고 曹南冥의 所見을 莊周와 一串이라 하야 非라 하고 崔孤雲과 如한 人은 한갓 文章을 尙하고 佛에 諂한 바 그를 文廟에 從亭케 함은 先聖을 辱함이 아니냐 하얏스며 嘗曰 『내가 佛經을 閱하야써 그 邪道임을 覈코저 하나 正히 涉水者가 其 水의 深淺을 試코저 하다가 마츰내 沒溺의 患을 當함과 가튼 일이 잇슬가 慮하야 此를 不果하노라』하며 又曰『學者는 다못 聖賢의 書를 讀하얏스면 그뿐이요 異端文字와 如함은 全然不知하야도 是可』라(金誠一手記)한 等의 語調를 見하면 先生이 如何히 儒學-아니 朱學 以外의 學을 排한가를 可知할지라. 그리고 巫覡祈禱와 가튼 일은 一切 嚴禁하야 자기 臨終 時에도 子弟를 召하야 一切의 祈禱를 禁하얏다.
「註」本項中「白沙詩敎」의 全文은『不得師傳口授終無自悟之理 吳草廬亦云提耳而誨之 可使不識一字之凡夫 立造神妙』

朝鮮 儒敎와 先生의 位置
朝鮮의 儒敎는 멀리 孔子 誕生 이전 箕子朝鮮 時代에서 其源을 發하얏다 할 수가 잇다. 그러나 事實은 箕子 當時는 勿論이요 降하야 三國時代-아니 高麗時代에까지 儒敎文化는 朝鮮에서 可觀할 것이 無하얏나니 이것은 古昔에는 一般 人文의 未開와 中古에 佛敎文化의 旺盛 等에 因하야 스스로 그리된 것이다. 高麗末葉에 至하야는 佛敎極盛의 反動으로써 安文成(裕) 白彝齋(頤正)가튼 이의 儒敎復興運動이 不無하얏스나 微而不著하얏스며＜82＞ 朝鮮에시 顯著하게 儒道文化의 輸入을 期하고 아울러 그 文化의 樹立을 運動한 이는 鄭圃隱으로써 其 始라 할지니 그는 主로 程朱의 學을 硏究하야 大學에서 長廣舌을 揮한 바 聽者-누구나 그 當을 認치 아니한 者-無하야 當時 그를 稱하되 光風霽月이라 하기에 至하얏스며 特히 先生의 國家를 爲하야 其 身을 殉한 忠孝大節은 萬古의 崇仰함이 되어써 그의 道學과 義行은 儼然히 儒家의 主力이 되어 東方道學의 祖가 된 觀이 有하얏다. 鄭氏는 其 道를 吉冶隱(再)에게 傳하고 冶隱은 金江湖(淑滋)에게, 江湖는 其子 佔畢(宗直)에게, 佔畢齋는 金寒喧堂(宏弼)에게, 寒暄堂은 鄭一蠹(汝昌)에게, 一蠹는 趙靜庵(光祖)에게 傳하얏다. 그런데 靜庵은 그 特異한 才調와 卓越한 器局으로써 朝廷에 立하야 王道의 實行으로써 自任하고 日夜庶政의 改新에 努力하얏스나 不幸히 己卯士禍에 觸하야 39歲로써 綾州謫所에서 運命의 戱弄함이 되고 一自以降의 朝鮮儒敎는 退溪先生으로써 그 正統을 삼아 其枝가 達하고 其花가 開하게 되엇다. 試하야 이제 退溪로 中心으로 하고 其後 儒道의 聯脉되어 간 것을 示하면 如下하다 할 수가 잇다.

그리고 先生의 道學은 멀리 玄海를 건너어 日本 儒學者의 尊崇한 바 되어 日本에서는 退溪로써 學統을 삼는 派가 多하여 딸아 先生의 思想과 行跡은 日本人 大部에게 알리어 그들은써하되 朝鮮에서는 오즉 先生 一人이 有하다 認함과 如하다.

結論
先生은 性度-溫醇하야 粹然하기 玉과 가탓스며 自幼時로 ＜83＞ 學問을 嗜好하야 자못 寢息을 잇다 십히 하되 其中에 朱子書를 耽讀하야 儒學의 精髓를 這裏에 捉得하얏스며 學은 반듯이 己를 爲하는 것이라 하야 무엇보다도 存心養性과 日用行事에서 所學의 實踐을 圖하얏스며 官歷으로 말하면 其位가 顯하고 딸아 進退가 無常하얏스나 自己의 尙趣와 長能이 그에 잇지 아니함을 안 先生은 처음부터 그를 즐겨하지 아니하얏스며 그 後 李芑가 用事하고 羣奸이 執柄함에 미처는 斷然히 鄕里로 돌아와 陶山에 隱退하야 오즉 斯學을 講하고 後生을 啓發하기에 慹力하얏스며 特히 林泉에 뜻이 만하 或은 單獨으로 或은 宗親門人으로 더불어 遠近의 水石을 探하야써 그 性情을 吟詠하얏스며 明宗 末年과 宣祖 初年에 잇서서는 朝廷으로부터 先生을 召함이 愈急하얏스나 그 進受치 못할 事由를 懇陳하야써 大槪로 應치 아니하얏슴에 不拘하고 愛君愛國의 衷心은 一日이라도 心中에 이즘이 업서 朝廷에 一政事의 失을 들으면 반듯이 얼굴에 근심이 보이고 一擧措의 得을 들으면 반듯이 얼굴에 깃븜이 나타낫다 하며 그 著書에 이르러는 別로 大成된 것은 업스나 그 여러 門人과 問答한 書簡의 大部와 辨, 論, 說과 가튼 等의 글월은 그 論議가 자못 鄭重하고 文章이 暢達하야 眞個의 珍品됨을 不失하며 門人의 手記로 된 言行錄 六卷은 실로 千古의 修身書가 될만하다. 그리고 先生이 最後까지 道를 信하야 益篤하며 學을 好하야 益勉하며 門人諸子와 講論을 易簀하기 幾日 前까지 繼續하야써 終是學者의 純摯를 保維함과 如함은 實로 萬古의 儀範으로써 天下人衆의 慕仰하기에 足하다. 要컨대 先生은 栗谷이 미리 評함에 가티 才調器局에 잇서서는 靜庵에게 不及하며 오즉 學하야 厭치 아니하며 行하야 倦치 아니하야써 義理를 深究하고 行事를 貞篤히 한 點에서는 古來의 누구라도 밋치기 어려운 큰 哲人이엇도다.
先生의 性格과 言行에 對하야는 實로 後生된 吾人으로서 實로 무엇이라 말슴할 수가 업고 오즉 感激함을 이기지 못할 것 뿐이나 先生의 그 思想과 그 硏究에 이르러는 爲先 記者로부터 생각되는 바가 업지 못하도다. 即 先生은 右에 旣述함과 가티 朱子의 學說을 그대로 繼續한 것인 同時에 當時 先生이 群儒의 思想을 모아써 集大成한 것이라 하면 그 集大成은 朱子의 思想을 中心으로 하야써 集成한 것일지며 朱子의 思想은 即 宋儒의 思想을 代表한 것이며 宋儒의 思想은 그때 中國의 東漢以降佛老의 思想이 一世를 風靡하던 反動으로부터 생긴 것인 同時에 그 思想은 스스로 異를 伐하고 同뿐을 取한 偏狹한 嫌이 업지 못한 것, 即 宋儒의 思想이 얼마큼 偏狹에 傾한 嫌이 업지 못한 것은＜84＞ 今日에 이르러는 누구나 共認하는 바다.
그런데 先生은 이러한 宋儒의 一人되는 朱子의 思想을 是繼하야써 그 思想과 그 態度를 그대로 後學에 傳한 結果는 先生以降 今日까지 四百年間의 朝鮮儒子로 하야곰 그 硏究를 儒家思想의 一方-儒家思想 中에도 일즉 顯現된 것 뿐에 偏하게 한 同時에 나아가 黨同伐異의 固陋한 齷齪한 士習을 馴致하게 한 嫌이 不無하도다.
이 氣味는 일즉 先生 自身의 思想 혹은 態度 中에 나타낫섯다 하야도 過言이 아니니 일럿스되 「내가 佛經을 閱하야써 그 邪道를 覈코저 하나 涉水者가 그 深淺을 試하다가 마츰내 沒溺하는 事가 잇슴 가튼 것을 慮하야 그리 아니하노라」함과 가튼 말슴은 實로 攻擊키 爲하야 攻擊한 말슴에 지내지 못하며 또 其他 花潭 王陽明 等의 說을 辨駁할 때에도 自己의 獨特한 理論으로써 其非를 論破함보다도 그 辨文을 見하면 만히는 다못 孔孟程朱의 片語를 引來하야써 古聖의 말이 이러하니 그 主張은 틀렷다 하며 또는 그것은 釋家에 近하니 틀렷다 함과 가튼 것은 後來의 學者로 하여곰 理致로써 다토지 아니하고 그저 聖人의 말슴뿐을 팔게 하는 버릇을 짓게 嫌이 업지 못하다. 勿論 先生은 스스로 어듬이 잇서 그리한 것이오 또한 그 所信과 所學에 熱中하는 先生의 거룩한 性格의 發露로써 스스로 그리됨인 바 바로 先生에게 對하야는 무엇이라 말할 수가 업스나 其後의 學者가 先生으로써 正統을 삼기까지 되는 崇慕의 極에 돌이어 그와 가튼 後弊를 어듬이 되엇슬 뿐이다. 吁.

記者曰  先生의 思想 言行에 對하야 가비업게 붓을 들 수가 업스며 또 그 文集만 하야도 四十九卷의 多에 達하는 바 如干한 探究로 先生의 思想이나 言行에 對한 輪廓조차 그릴 수가 업습니다. 責任上 할 수 업사와 爲先 이러케 하온 바 그 잘못된 것은 發見되는 대로 改正하겟사오며 내종으로 이 先生의 溫醇貞篤한 性格과 그 性格으로부터 發露된 言行의 全部는 저 日月과 가티 永遠에 빗날 것을 스스로 미드며 그만 붓을 놋습니다.＜85＞
