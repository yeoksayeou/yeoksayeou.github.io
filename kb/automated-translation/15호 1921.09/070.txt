A Glimpse into the Theories of Master Sŏ Hwadam
						One Reporter

The general outline of Master Hwadam's life and theories was broadly introduced in the previous issue of this journal. However, as the text itself indicated, it was merely an introduction, and for those wishing to study the Master's unique thought and profound theories more thoroughly, there might have been a sense of scratching an itch through a boot. Considering this, we now present verbatim the five works that are central among the Master's writings: *Wŏn Ri Ki* (Origin of Principle and Material Force), *Ri Ki Sŏl* (Discourse on Principle and Material Force), *T'aehŏ Sŏl* (Discourse on the Great Void), *Kwishin Saengsa Ron* (Treatise on Spirits, Death, and Life), and *Pok Ki Kyŏn Ch'ŏnji chi Shim Sŏl* (Discourse on Returning to See the Mind of Heaven and Earth). We hope that by encountering the introductory text from the previous issue and the Master's own writings in this issue, our readers will thoroughly study even this one figure's complete aspect, thereby fulfilling this journal's aspiration.

Origin of Principle and Material Force (原理氣)

The Great Void (太虛) is tranquil and formless. It is called the Antecedent Heaven (先天). Its greatness has no outside. Its precedence has no beginning. Its coming cannot be investigated. Its tranquil vacuity and stillness are its origin. It fills the boundless distance without exterior, densely packed and substantial, with no empty gaps, not even a hair's breadth of space to spare. Yet, if you try to ladle it, it is empty; if you try to grasp it, it is nothing. However, it is nevertheless substantial; it cannot be called nothingness. Reaching this state, there is no sound to be heard, no scent to be perceived. It is where the thousand sages do not speak, where Chou [Tun-i] and Chang [Tsai] draw back without uttering, where Master Shao [Yung] could not set down a single character. Gathering the words of sages and worthies and tracing them back to their source: the *I Ching* speaks of "silent and unmoving"; the *Doctrine of the Mean* speaks of "sincerity achieving itself." Speaking of its tranquil substance, it is called the One *Ki* (一氣). Speaking of its undifferentiated pervasiveness, it is called the Great One (太一). Lien-hsi (濂溪) [Chou Tun-i], faced with this, had no choice but to utter the words: "Non-polar and yet the Supreme Polarity (無極而太極)." This, then, is the Antecedent Heaven. Is it not wondrous? Wondrous, wondrous. Is it not marvelous? Marvelous, marvelous. Suddenly it leaps, abruptly it opens. Who causes this? It is able of itself. It also cannot but be so. This is called the timeliness of principle (理). The *I Ching* speaks of "stimulated and thereupon penetrating"; the *Doctrine of the Mean* speaks of "the Way realizing itself." Chou speaks of "the Supreme Polarity moving and generating *yang*." It cannot be without motion and stillness, without closing and opening. What is the reason? The generative force (機) is inherently so. Since it is called One *Ki*, the one inherently contains two. Since it is called the Great One, the one readily embraces two. One cannot but generate two. Two can naturally generate and overcome. Generation leads to overcoming; overcoming leads to generation. That *ki* progresses from the subtle to the agitated is caused by its generation and overcoming. One generates two. What are the two? *Yin* and *yang*. Stillness and motion. Also called *k'an* (坎 water) and *li* (離 fire). What is the one? It is the beginning of *yin* and *yang*, the substance of *k'an* and *li*, that which is tranquil as one.<62> The division of the One *Ki* becomes *yin* and *yang*. *Yang*, reaching the extreme of its agitation, becomes Heaven. *Yin*, reaching the extreme of its coagulation, becomes Earth. The essence congealed at the extremity of *yang*'s agitation becomes the sun. The essence congealed at the extremity of *yin*'s coagulation becomes the moon. The scattered remainder of the essence becomes the stars and constellations. On Earth, they become water and fire. This is called the Subsequent Heaven (後天), that which is functional. Heaven circulates its *ki*, primarily characterized by motion, revolving without cease. Earth solidifies its form, primarily characterized by stillness, fixed in the center. The nature of *ki* is motion; it tends to ascend. The substance of form is heavy; it tends to descend. *Ki* envelops form from without; form is contained within *ki*. The mutual pause between the ascending and descending tendencies results in suspension within the Great Void, neither ascending nor descending, revolving left and right, enduring through all ages without falling. What Shao [Yung] called "Heaven relies on form, Earth attaches to *ki*, mutually relying and attaching"—the mechanism of this reliance and attachment, is it not marvelous? The wings of feathered creatures among the wind-borne and flying species, carrying their forms, all follow this principle.
Master [Sŏ] also said: The void (虛) is the abyss of *ki*.
Also said: One is not a number; it is the substance of number.
Also said: The one of principle (理) is its void; the one of *ki* is its coarseness. Combining them is marvelous indeed.
Also said: The *I Ching* says, "Swift without haste, arriving without travelling." *Ki* is nowhere not present; how could it be hasty? *Ki* reaches everywhere; where would it travel? The marvel of *ki*'s tranquil formlessness is called *shen* (神 spirit/spiritual). Since it is called *ki*, it readily possesses coarseness, bordering on traces (迹). *Shen* is not confined by coarse traces. How indeed can it be localized? How can it be fathomed? Speaking of its "that by which" (所以), it is called principle (理). Speaking of its marvelous quality (所以妙), it is called *shen*. Speaking of its natural reality, it is called sincerity (誠). Speaking of its ability to leap forth and flow, it is called the Way (道). Encompassing all without lack, it is called the Supreme Polarity (太極). Motion and stillness cannot but succeed each other, and the mechanism of function is inherently so. What is called "one *yin* and one *yang* constitute the Way" is this.
Also said: Ch'eng [brothers] and Chang [Tsai] said Heaven's greatness has no outside; this means the Great Void has no outside. Knowing the Great Void is one, then one knows all else is not one. Master Shao said: "Some say that beyond Heaven and Earth, there are other Heavens and Earths, and myriad things different from the myriad things of this Heaven and Earth. I cannot know of this. Not only can I not know of it, the sages also could not know of it." One should reflect further on this statement by Master Shao.
Also said: The Ch'an (Zen) school says, "Emptiness arises within the Great Awakening, like a single bubble emerging from the sea." Some speak of "true emptiness" and "stubborn emptiness." This is not knowing that Heaven's greatness has no outside, not knowing that the void is itself *ki*. Talk of emptiness arising, whether true or stubborn, fails to grasp the very reason why principle and *ki* are principle and *ki* (理氣之所以爲理氣者也). How can this be called knowing nature? And how can it be called knowing the Way?

Discourse on Principle and Material Force (理氣說)

Having no outside is called the Great Void. Having no beginning is called *ki*. The void is itself *ki*. The void is fundamentally boundless; *ki* is also boundless. The source of *ki*, its beginning, is one. Yet, being called *ki*, the one readily embraces two. The Great Void is one; within it, it embraces two, thus becoming two. Therefore, it cannot be without closing and opening, without motion and stillness, without generation and overcoming. Investigating the reason why it can close and open, move and be still, generate and overcome, it is named the Supreme Polarity (太極). There is no principle outside of *ki*; principle is the ruler (宰) of *ki*. What is called ruler does not mean coming from outside to rule; it refers to the functioning of *ki* itself, its ability not to lose the correctness of its 'thusness' (所以然之正), and is thus called ruler. Principle does not precede *ki*. *Ki* has no beginning; principle certainly has no beginning. If one were to say principle precedes *ki*, then *ki* would have a beginning. Lao Tzu said, "The void can generate *ki*." If so, then *ki* would have a beginning and be limited.
Also said: The *I Ching* is the transformation of *yin* and *yang*. *Yin* and *yang* are the two *ki*. "One *yin* and one *yang*" refers to the Great One (太一). Being two, it transforms; being one, it is marvelous. It is not that there is something called marvelous separate from transformation.<63> The reason the two *ki* can endlessly generate and transform without cease is precisely the marvel of the Supreme Polarity. To speak of the marvelous apart from transformation is not to know the *I Ching*.

Discourse on the Great Void (太虛說)

The Great Void: void yet not void. The void is itself *ki*. The void is boundless, without exterior; *ki* is also boundless, without exterior. Since it is called void, how can it be called *ki*? It is said: void and stillness are the substance (體) of *ki*; aggregation and dispersion are its function (用). Knowing the void is not truly void, one cannot call it nothingness (無). Lao Tzu said, "Being arises from non-being (有生於無)." This shows ignorance that the void is itself *ki*. He also said, "The void can generate *ki*." This is incorrect. If the void generated *ki*, then before the generation, there would be no *ki*, and the void would be dead. If there were indeed no *ki*, how could *ki* be generated from it? It has no beginning; it has no generation. Since it has no beginning, how could it end? Since it has no generation, how could it perish? Lao Tzu speaks of void and non-being (虛無); the Buddhists speak of quiescent extinction (寂滅). This is not recognizing the source of principle and *ki*. How then could they know the Way?

Treatise on Spirits, Death, and Life (鬼神死生論)

The explanations of Ch'eng [brothers], Chang [Tsai], and Chu [Hsi] exhaustively describe the conditions of death, life, ghosts, and spirits (鬼神). However, they have not fully explained the ultimate reason 'why it is so' (所以然之極致). They all alluded to it but did not fully develop it, leaving learners to attain it themselves. This is why later scholars grasp one aspect but not the other, transmitting the coarse elements without seeing the full refinement. I wish to gather the subtle meanings of these three masters to form a straightforward discussion, which may also suffice to dispel the doubts of a thousand ages. Ch'eng said, "Death and life, humans and ghosts, are one and yet two, two and yet one." This encompasses it all. I also say: death and life, humans and ghosts, are merely the aggregation and dispersion of *ki*. There is aggregation and dispersion, but no coming into being or ceasing to be. The fundamental substance of *ki* is like this. The tranquil, unified, clear, and void aspect of *ki* is the void that permeates boundlessly without exterior. Its great aggregation forms Heaven and Earth; its small aggregations form the myriad things. The dynamics of aggregation and dispersion merely differ in subtlety, prominence, duration, and speed. The aggregation and dispersion of large and small entities within the Great Void differ due to their size. Even for the minutest things like a single blade of grass or a tree, their *ki* ultimately does not disperse. How much more so for the human spirit, consciousness, and perception, which are aggregations both large and enduring? Form and corporeal soul (形魄) appear to disperse, seeming to return to annihilation, submerged in nothingness. At this point, most fail to reflect thoroughly. Even among the disciples of the three masters, not all could reach the ultimate point; most just picked up coarse fragments to form their theories. The tranquil, unified, clear, and void aspect of *ki* originates from the beginning when the Supreme Polarity moved to generate *yang* and rested to generate *yin*. Aggregation occurred gradually, eventually transmitting substance to become Heaven and Earth, and to become us. When a person disperses, it is only the form and corporeal soul that disperse. That which aggregated as tranquil, unified, clear, and void ultimately does not disperse. It disperses into the midst of the tranquil and unified Great Void, being the same one *ki*. The aggregation and dispersion of consciousness only differ in duration. Even for the fastest dispersion, like that lasting for months or days (日月期), which pertains to the minutest of things, their *ki* ultimately does not disperse either. Why? Because the tranquil, unified, clear, and void aspect of *ki*, having no beginning, also has no end. This is the reason principle and *ki* are ultimately marvelous. If scholars can diligently work to reach this point, they will begin to penetrate the subtle meaning left untransmitted by the thousand sages. Even the *ki* of a single stick of incense, though seen dispersing before one's eyes, its remaining *ki* ultimately does not disperse. How could one say it is completely reduced to nothingness?
In the past, when I discussed this with Master Pak Kwang-u (朴先生光佑), Pak immediately understood with clarity. I wonder if Pak later managed to exert effort towards the complete, ultimate point. I roughly state my unique view and entrust it to Pak Kong Yi-jŏng (朴公頤正), Hŏ Kun T'ae-hwi (許君太輝), and all who come to study at my gate. Although this treatise is clumsy in expression, its insight reaches the ground untransmitted by the thousand sages. Do not let it be lost midway. It should be transmitted to later scholars, spread throughout China and the barbarian lands, near and far (遍諸華夷遠邇), so they know a scholar has emerged from the East (知東方有學者出焉).
Also said: Creation and spirits (造化鬼神). The *shen* (神) of the *I Ching*. The ultimate point of *yin* and *yang*. Later scholars gain much from the Appended Phrases (繫辭). Transmitting the teachings of Chou, Ch'eng, Chang, and Chu requires unceasing effort. Only after great exertion will there be insight.
Also said: I once wished to expound the subtle meaning of the Appended Phrases. Ch'eng and Chu both exerted their utmost effort, yet they only explained briefly, leaving later scholars with no path to follow. They generally grasped the coarse aspects but not the underlying essence. I wished to elaborate on my shallow views to let later scholars follow the stream to probe its source. I intended to write a book when my energy was fully depleted, but this ambition remains unfulfilled, which is indeed a regret. Yet, it is not worth regretting. Adding commentary upon commentary, if later scholars find it too complex, they might also fail to reflect on it. Written by candlelight on the night of the fifth day of the intercalary first month, Ulsa year (乙已閏正月初五夜). The above four pieces were all written by the Master when critically ill.

Discourse on Returning to See the Mind of Heaven and Earth (復其見天地之心說)

The ancient sages and worthies all paid attention to this. Yao set forth the numbers of the intercalary periods; Confucius discussed the mind of Heaven and Earth; Ch'eng and Shao also offered explanations. Later scholars must exert great effort concerning the solstice (至日) and undertake cultivation. The gains are vast, not comparable to investigating a single thing or extending knowledge of one matter. If one thoroughly investigates a single thing, one can also perceive the ultimate principle; however, concerning the solstice, what it encompasses is broad and great. The solstice is the day when Heaven and Earth begin to turn back, when *yin* and *yang* initially transform. Thus it is said, "In returning (復), does one not see the mind of Heaven and Earth?" Previous Confucians all saw the mind of Heaven and Earth through stillness (靜). Master Ch'eng uniquely stated that the inception of motion (動之端) is the mind of Heaven and Earth. Master Shao spoke of it in terms of the interval between motion and stillness (動靜之間). Although Ch'eng and Shao formulated their statements differently, there was initially no divergence in their views. Both spoke concerning the single aspect of motion-stillness, encompassing *yin* and *yang*. It seems Shao pointed to the substance (體) of the Supreme Polarity, while Ch'eng referred to its function (用). Returning to the root and restoring stillness is the time of *k'un* (坤 earth/receptive). The activation of *yang* energy is the mechanism of return (復). The extremity of being and non-being can be inferred here, and the doctrines of Antecedent and Subsequent Heaven can thus be known. What the *I Ching* calls "silent and unmoving; stimulated and thereupon penetrating" refers to this. What the *Doctrine of the Mean* calls "sincerity achieving itself; the Way realizing itself" refers to this. What Mencius calls "There must be the practice [of righteousness], but do not have the mind fixed on it. Let not the mind forget, nor assist it to grow" should also be apprehended through this. When Heaven and Earth are purely cleansed, the flavor of the dark wine (玄酒) is faint, the sound of the great music (太音) is rare, utterly vacant and still, as if nothing were happening—then the return of the one *yang*, leaping forth gently, its marvel of being unable to contain itself—this is how one can see the mind of Heaven and Earth. What is meant by "no change or shift"? The celestial circumference is 365 and 1/4 degrees; the cycle of the year is 365 and 1/4 days. At the solstice, observed with the water clock's arrow (漏箭) and measured with the gnomon's shadow (臬表), the divisions of degrees and days exactly complete the fundamental number, fitting together like the two halves of a tally, never exceeding or falling short by a single hair's breadth. It has been constantly so for myriad ages. From this, one can see that its mind involves no change or shift. The Mean (中庸) of Heaven and Earth, the utmost goodness (至善), utmost faithfulness (至信), utmost virtue (至德), are recognized here. The non-localized, formless nature of the spiritual *I Ching* (神易) is seen here. The sun's path turns back from the south, spring brilliance reaches the northern lands, *yang* blows across the nine regions, *ki* responds in the central palace (黃宮)—can this not be called non-localized (無方)? Day and night alter their lengths, cold and heat succeed each other, without a moment's pause—can this not be called formless (無體)? "One *yin* and one *yang* constitute the Way; that which continues it is goodness"—this saying fully expresses the principle of the solstice. One *yin* and one *yang*, one motion and one stillness—these are fundamentally not two separate matters but simply the one activity of Heaven. *Yin* and *yang* are a single function; motion and stillness are a single mechanism. This is why they flow and circulate, unable to stop themselves. Some might ask, "Can the virtues of utmost centrality, utmost goodness, and utmost faithfulness only be spoken of concerning the solstice? Can they not be spoken of at other times?" Reply: There is no time when it is not so, no thing in which it is not present. The revolution through 360 days, the divisions of the 24 solar terms—all are the flowing operation of the solstice principle. This is what is called "timely centrality" (時中). However, compared to the solstice, Heaven and Earth are renewed; at the juncture of *yin* and *yang*, the interchange of motion and stillness, the positions of the constellations (辰宿), the divisions of the terrestrial regions (陸野)—all regain their original positions, perfectly ordered. It is the source from which the myriad transformations arise, the root of the myriad differentiations. This is the grand head-place (大頭臚處) of *yin* and *yang*, through which all can be unified by a single thread. Reflecting on the nature of benevolence and wisdom within ourselves, the Way of loyalty and reciprocity—none is apart from the principle of the solstice. Even momentarily in motion or stillness, subtly in the blink of an eye <65>

**Summary**

This article from the 1921 issue of *Kaebyŏk* magazine introduces and presents five key philosophical essays by the 16th-century Korean Neo-Confucian scholar Sŏ Hwadam (Seo Gyeongdeok). The essays delve into his distinct monistic philosophy centered on *ki* (material force), exploring its relationship with *li* (principle), the nature of the Great Void (*T'aehŏ*), life, death, spirits (*kwishin*), and the cosmological significance of the solstice as revealing the "mind of Heaven and Earth." The author ("One Reporter") encourages readers to study Sŏ Hwadam's original texts thoroughly to grasp a unique aspect of Korean thought. From a colonial history perspective, the publication of classical Korean philosophy in a prominent nationalist magazine like *Kaebyŏk* represents an act of cultural self-assertion against Japanese assimilation policies. Sŏ Hwadam's ideas, particularly his *ki*-monism differing from mainstream Zhu Xi orthodoxy, were highlighted by some Korean intellectuals as a distinct contribution, and the explicit desire expressed in the text to make this Eastern (Korean) scholarship known abroad underscores the burgeoning cultural nationalism of the period.

程張朱說. 極備死生鬼神之情狀. 然亦未*說破所以然之極致. 皆引而不發. 令學者自得. 此. 後學之所以得其一. 而不得其二. 傳其粗. 而不見十分之精. 某欲採三先生之微旨. 以爲鶻突之論. 亦足以破千古之疑. 程曰. 死生人鬼一而二. 二而一. 此盡之矣. 吾亦曰. 死生人鬼. 只是氣之聚散而已. 有聚散. 而無有無. 氣之本體然矣. 氣之湛一淸虛者. 邇漫無外之虛. 聚之大者. 爲天地. 聚之小者. 爲萬物. 聚散之勢. 有微著久速耳. 大小之聚散於太虛. 以大小有殊. 雖一草一木之微者. 其氣終亦不散. 况人之精神知覺. 聚之大且久者哉. 形魄. 見其有散. 似歸於盡. 沒於無. 此處. 率皆不得致思. 雖三先生之門下. 亦莫能皆詣其極. 皆掇拾粗粕爲說爾. 氣之湛一淸虛. 原於太極之動而生陽. 靜而生陰之始. 聚之有漸. 以至傳厚爲天地. 爲吾人. 人之散也. 形魄散耳. 聚之湛一淸虛者. 終亦不散. 散於太虛湛一之中. 同一氣也. 其知覺之聚散. 只有久速耳. 雖散之最速. 有日月期者. 乃物之微者爾. 其氣終亦不散. 何者. 氣之湛一淸虛者. 旣無其始. 又無其終. 此理氣所以極妙底. 學者苟能做工到此此頭. 始得覤破千聖不盡傳之微旨矣. 雖一片香燭之氣. 見其有散於目前. 其餘氣. 終亦不散. 烏得謂之盡於無耶.
往者. 某與朴先生光佑. 討論及此. 朴. 乃耳輒明快. 不知其後. 朴. 果能致力於十分盡頭否也. 粗述獨見. 貽朴公頤正 許君太輝. 及諸來遊於門者. 此論. 雖辭拙然. 見到千聖不盡傳之地頭爾. 勿令中失. 可傳之後學. 遍諸華夷遠邇. 知東方有學者出焉.
又曰造化鬼神. 神易. 陰陽之極致處. 後學. 有多得於繫辭. 傳周程張朱之說. 要在做工不輟. 大段著力然後. 乃有見爾.
又曰嘗欲發揮繫辭微旨. 程朱皆極其力然. 略說破後學. 無蹊可尋. 類皆見得粗處. 不見底蘊. 某欲可敷 衍淺見. 令後學沿流. 以探其源. 竣吾精力盡時著書. 有志未就. 良亦一恨. 然不足恨也. 註脚更添註脚. 奈後學. 若其繁複. 亦莫之致思. 何乙已閏正月初五夜秉燭而書焉 已上四篇皆先生病亟時所箸

復其見天地之心說
古之聖賢. 於此皆嘗致意. 堯陳朞閏之數. 孔論天地之心. 程邵亦皆有說. 後之學者. 須大段著力於至日上. 做工夫. 所得甚廣. 非如格一物. 致一知之比也. 若於一物上. 十分格得破則亦見得至理. 顧於至日. 則所該廣大耳. 至日. 乃天地始回旋. 陰陽初變化之日也. 故曰. 復其見天地之心乎. 先儒. 皆以靜見天地之心. 程子. 獨謂動之端. 乃天地之心. 邵子. 則以動靜之間言之. 程邵立言有異. 初無二見. 皆就一動靜. 兼陰陽之上而語之. 似邵指太極之體. 程謂太極之用也. 反本復靜. 坤之時也. 陽氣發動. 復之機也. 有無之極. 於此擬之. 而先後天之說. 從可知也. 易所謂寂然不動. 感而遂通者. 謂此也. 庸所謂誠自成道自道者. 謂此也. 孟子所謂必有事焉而勿正心. 勿忘勿助長. 亦於此而體之. 方天地淨洒洒. 玄酒之味淡. 太音之聲希. 漠然虛靜. 若無所事. 一陽之復. 條爾而躍. 其不自容已之妙. 是可見天地之心也. 無改移者. 何謂也. 周天三百六十五度四分度之一. 朞歲三百六十五日四分日之一. 至日. 候之以漏箭. 測之以臬表. 度與日之分. 恰周得本數. 若合符契. 未嘗盈縮些一毫. 萬古常常如此. 可見其心之無改移也. 天地之中庸. 至善至信至德. 於此而識之. 神易之無方體. 於此而見之. 日軌回南. 春輝北陸. 陽吹九地. 氣應黃宮. 可不謂之無方也乎. 晝夜改度. 寒暑相禪. 無一刻停留. 可不謂之無體也乎. 一陰一陽之謂道. 繼之者善. 此語. 盡至日之理也. 一陰一陽. 一動一靜. 此本非兩事. 只是天之一事. 陰陽一用. 動靜一機. 此所以流行循環. 不能自已者也. 或曰至中至善至信之德. 只得於至日上語之其於他. 不得語之乎. 曰. 無時不然. 無物不有. 三百六旬之運. 二十四氣之分. 無非至日之流行者. 所謂時中也. 然不比至日則天地更始. 陰陽之際. 動靜之交. 辰宿之躔. 陸野 之分. 皆得復其本位. 十分齊整者也. 萬化之所自. 萬殊之所本. 此陰陽大頭臚處. 可以一貫之者也. 反於吾身仁智之性. 忠恕之道. 無非至日之理. 暫於動靜. 微於瞬息 ＜65＞
