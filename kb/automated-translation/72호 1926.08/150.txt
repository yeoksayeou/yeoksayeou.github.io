暑中雜詠 (Miscellaneous Songs in the Midst of Summer Heat)

扇 Fan   金笠 (Kim Ip)
平生不受汚人塵, 把作炎凉進退身. 半席淸風搖引每, 一堂明月挕來新. 題詩秋筐宮娥老, 興酒春爐野客貧. 白羽儀狀堪可羨, 携君欲訪臥龍隣.
All my life I have not received the dust that stains people,
Holding this [fan], I navigate the world's heat and cold.
Half a mat's clear breeze is always drawn by its waving,
A whole room's bright moon seems freshly gathered by it.
An old palace maid inscribes poems on autumn baskets,
A poor rustic guest enjoys wine by a spring stove.
Your white-feathered appearance is truly enviable,
Taking you, I wish to visit the neighbor of the Sleeping Dragon.

靑蛙 Green Frog  丁酉山 (Chŏng Yu-san)
綠色通身絶小蛙, 一生端正坐梅丫. 非渠敢有居高志, 却怕鷄膓活見埋.
A tiny frog, green all over its body,
Sits upright its whole life on the fork of a plum branch.
It's not that it dares to harbor ambitions of high dwelling,
Rather, it fears being buried alive by chicken guts.

蟬 Cicada    羅隱 (Na Ŭn)
纔入新秋百感生, 就中蟬噪最堪驚. 能催時節凋雙*, 愁對江山聽一聲. 不妨管絃拘醉態, 偏依楊柳引離情. 故園聞處猶怊悵, 況是經年萬里行.
Just as early autumn enters, a hundred feelings arise,
Among them, the cicada's cry is most startling.
It can hasten the season, withering one's temples*, (*Character likely 鬢: temples)
Gazing sadly at the river and mountains, I listen to its sound.
It doesn't hinder the pipes and strings that accompany drunkenness,
Yet, clinging to the willow, it evokes feelings of parting.
Hearing it in my hometown was still melancholic,
How much more so now, on a year-long journey of ten thousand li.

蚊 Mosquito 嚶嚶耳邊過, 頻見打顂人.
Buzzing, it passes by the ear; often see people swatting near their heads.

蚤 Flea 八八長版走, 但見一指人.
Hops briskly across the floorboards; just see a person trying to squash it with one finger.

虱 Louse 瑟瑟腰下入, 未見正口人.＜79＞
Stealthily enters below the waist; haven't seen a person catch it squarely.

This year too, it seems the "Bourgeoisie" (뿔조아) scoundrels' pleasure-seeking (行樂) is the same as ever. To escape the heat, they take their beautiful mistresses (美人愛妾) to the seaside resorts, play lavishly (질탕하게), eat various dishes until their bellies burst like Namsan (南山), and then listen to the sound of refreshing music. However, the Proletariat (無産者) whose blood they suck, work shedding sweat on farms, in factories, and at all other workplaces, yet have nothing to eat. At night, they fight bloody battles (혈투) with bedbugs, mosquitoes (모긔), and fleas (벼록이) and cannot even sleep well. How unfair this damned world is.＜80＞

**Summary**

This article juxtaposes classical Chinese-style poems (Hansi) on summer themes—a fan offering respite, a frog's precarious perch, a cicada's melancholic cry, and verses on annoying insects—with a sharp, contemporary critique of social inequality. The prose section contrasts the luxurious summer leisure of the wealthy elite, referred to dismissively as "뿔조아" (bourgeoisie), with the harsh reality faced by the "無産者" (proletariat), who endure grueling labor, poverty, and infestations of pests. The piece uses the imagery of summer and its associated discomforts (heat, insects) to highlight the stark class divide and suffering of the working class under the perceived exploitation by the rich. For historians, the article is interesting for its explicit use of class terminology ("뿔조아", "無産者") in a popular magazine like *Kaebyŏk* in 1926, reflecting the growing social consciousness and socialist/nationalist critiques of the colonial era's socio-economic structure. The contrast between traditional poetic forms and modern social commentary is also noteworthy.

금년 녀름에도 「뿔조아」놈들의 行樂은 여전한 모양이다. 피서하느라고 해수욕장으로 美人愛妾을  다리고 가서 질탕하게 놀고 배가 南山가티 터지도록 各色 요리를 먹고 나서는 또 청량한 음악 소리를 듯고 잇다. 그러나 그들에게 피를 빨리는 無産者들은 농장에서 공장에서 기타 모든 일터에서 땀을 흘리며 일을 하야도 먹을 것이 업고. 밤이면 빈대 모긔 벼록이와 혈투하여 잠도 잘 자지 못한다. 이놈의 세상이 그 얼마나 불공평하냐.＜80＞
