餘墨
The August issue, as is customary, has endeavoured to include articles that are as refreshing and straightforward as possible. Additionally, because we primarily included articles from P'yŏngan North and Kyŏngsang North provinces, we felt the difficulties regarding editing were excessive.

To mention first, the essays such as Pae Sŏngnyong's "Letter from the Farming Village," Chu Yohan's "The Nature of Science," Kim Kijin's "The Globalization of the Clarté Movement," Pak Ŭnsik's "China During the 12 Years After the Revolution," and Im Chŏngjae's "A Piece Addressed to the Gentlemen of Letters (Continued)," along with two other short stories, one tragic play, two poems, and one piece of impressionistic writing, were inevitably pushed to the next issue.

Listen everyone, there is something our editorial department wishes to ask of you, our readers. It's nothing else but this: when you read an article in this magazine, please write down and send us the impressions that arise at that moment, or concrete critiques regarding it. If you do so, it will serve as a reference for us in various ways, and the majority of these will be published in the magazine to serve as a reference for all of you as well.

This is not something the editorial department should be saying, but due to the company's business policy this time, we have no choice but to announce that we will be sending the magazine only to subscribers who pay in advance, irrespective of branch offices or individual readers. Due to this, it seems temporary feelings of disappointment may arise among you, our readers. The editorial department also submitted various mitigating opinions regarding this, but it was decided as such under the reasoning that doing so is not only for the sake of the company but also, in a strict sense, shows respect and affection for the readers.

The upcoming September issue will be the New Autumn Issue. It will be fully loaded with refreshing articles concerning contemplation and criticism. We believe it will have a flavor even newer than the cool autumn air.

**Summary**

This editor's postscript from the August 1923 issue of *Kaebyŏk* explains that several planned articles had to be postponed due to editorial difficulties, partly arising from focusing on content from specific regions (North P'yŏngan and North Kyŏngsang). The editors issue a strong call for reader feedback and critical reviews, promising to publish contributions. Significantly, it announces a major policy change: due to business reasons, the magazine will now only be sent to subscribers who pay in advance, acknowledging this might cause reader dissatisfaction but framing it as necessary for the company and ultimately respectful to readers. The postscript concludes by previewing the September "New Autumn Issue," promising thoughtful and critical content. For historians, this piece offers insight into the editorial and financial challenges faced by Korean intellectual magazines under colonial rule, including regional content balancing, the desire for reader engagement, and the shift towards stricter, pre-paid subscription models likely reflecting economic pressures. The specific mention of authors like Pak Ŭnsik and topics like the post-revolutionary China or the Clarté movement also points to the intellectual currents engaging Korean thinkers at the time.
