**Body Text Translation**
May There Be Misfortune, Hyŏn'il

Some time ago, there was the special act of Mr. Kang T'aekchin (姜宅鎭), a young man of earnest purpose, who donated all of his own land to the Tenant Farmers' Union (小作人組合) and obtained a single servant's quarters room (行廊房) in Kyŏngsŏng (京城) to become an ice cream vendor. This time, Mr. Ch'oe Sŏksu (崔錫洙) of Kwangju (光州) has donated all his land and houses to the Labor Mutual Aid Society (勞働共濟會) there, contributing to the promotion of the labor movement.

Seeing such new instances of property abandonment (財産 抛棄) frequently occurring, the fundamental transformation (根本的 改造) of Chosŏn (朝鮮) appears perhaps close at hand. <53>

**Summary**

This news brief reports on two recent philanthropic acts in colonial Korea: Kang T'aekchin donating his land to a tenant farmers' union and becoming an ice cream seller in Seoul, and Ch'oe Sŏksu donating his land and houses to a labor mutual aid society in Kwangju. The author interprets these donations as encouraging signs pointing towards a potential fundamental social transformation in Korea. For historians, this article is interesting as it highlights early instances of wealth redistribution motivated by social consciousness or nascent socialist/cooperative ideals during the colonial period. It reflects growing awareness of labor and tenant issues and suggests that some members of the propertied class were sympathetic to movements aiming for social change, seeing these acts as steps towards a "fundamental transformation" of Korean society.
