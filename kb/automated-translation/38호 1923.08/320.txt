社告 (Company Announcement)

This issue is, of course, the North P'yŏngan Province issue. However, it is also the August Summer Cooling issue. Thinking, "Should we make it a Province Issue or a Summer Cooling Issue? If it's both a Province Issue and a Summer Cooling Issue, wouldn't that be killing two birds with one stone (一擧兩得)?"

Therefore, our company has edited this August issue as both the North P'yŏngan Province Issue and the August Summer Cooling Issue. Consequently, the cover design and editing style are very different from the usual Province Issues. Specifically, whereas we used to draw a map of Chosŏn (朝鮮地圖) on the cover and mark the featured province in red, this time we have included a cool and refreshing picture of a lone boat coming and going freely on a clear river under green shade. That is, because you all feel so hot and are sweating, we have prioritized the 'Summer Cooling' aspect so that you might feel even a touch of coolness (凉味).

Perhaps those in North P'yŏngan might have this complaint: "For other province issues, the map was primary, making that province turn red (赤化). Why only for the North P'yŏngan Province Issue...? So, does that mean North P'yŏngan shouldn't be reddened?" However, what difference does being marked red make? Isn't it enough if it's cool and refreshing, making body and mind (心身) feel pleasant?

Also, regarding the editing format, whereas in usual Province Issues we separated the main issue articles above and the province-specific articles below, we felt that was too rigid and restrictive. This time, we have mixed the main issue and province issue articles together indiscriminately (混同編輯). We realized (覺破) that this way, the articles themselves will have more vitality (生氣), and readers also won't find it disjointed (支離).

Especially, a word to the people of North P'yŏngan is about the fact that, while calling it the North P'yŏngan Province Issue, we could not publish the entirety of the field survey (踏査) report all at once. As you will see from the contents, because this is a Summer Cooling Issue, we have specifically selected many refreshing articles. Also, as we had to include unfinished articles from the Kyŏngsang Pukto (慶北) issue, due to an excess of pages (面數의 太過), we unavoidably had to postpone half of the North P'yŏngan content—specifically, the entire survey report by Mr. Cho Ki-kan (趙基栞君)—for publication in the upcoming September issue. Along with Mr. Pak Tal-sŏng's (朴達成君) account of the border survey (國境踏査記) and the report on the conditions of compatriots across the river (對岸同胞狀況記). Please forgive us (寬恕); we have no choice but to ask you to wait until the September issue.

**Summary**

This company announcement from *Kaebyŏk* explains that the August 1923 issue serves a dual purpose: the North P'yŏngan Province special and a "Summer Cooling" issue. The editors changed the cover from the usual red-marked map to a refreshing river scene and mixed provincial content with general articles to enhance reader experience during the hot weather and improve article vitality. Due to prioritizing "cooling" articles and including leftover content from a previous Kyŏngsang Pukto issue, page constraints forced the delay of half the North P'yŏngan features, including field reports by Cho Ki-kan and Pak Tal-sŏng, until the September issue. The editors apologize for the delay, especially to readers from North P'yŏngan. This notice is interesting for colonial history as it shows editorial adaptability to practical constraints (page limits, reader comfort) and strategic engagement with regional readership. The mention of specific journalists' delayed reports on North P'yŏngan and cross-border compatriots highlights the magazine's active documentation efforts and awareness of geographically dispersed Korean populations.

本號는 母論 平北道號이외다. 그러나 8月 納凉號이외다 「道號로 할가 納凉號로 할가 道號요 納凉號면 一擧兩得이 안이랴」하야.
이에 本社는 本誌 8月號를 平北道號 兼 8月 納凉號로 編輯하얏소이다. 그래서 表形과 編輯方이 例의 道號와는 매우 달너졋슴니다. 卽 表紙에 朝鮮地圖를 그리고 道號를 當한 그 道는 赤色으로 標하든 것을 今番은 綠陰下淸江上에 一葉扁舟가 任去來하는 그- 서늘하고 시원한 그림을 녀엇슴니다. 卽 여러분이 하도 더워하시며 땀을 흘니시기로 一点의 凉味나마 感하시도록 하랴고 納凉 그것을 主하얏슴니다.
혹- 平北계신 이는 이런 불평이나 업슬넌지요 「다른 도호에는 지도를 主로 하야 그 道로 하야금 赤化를 식켜놋터니 平北道號만 엇지해서... 그래 平北은 적화치 말난 말이냐」하고. 그러나 적화된단들 別數 잇슴닛가 서늘하고 시원하야 心身이 快하얏스면 그만 안임닛가 그리고 編輯의 方式도 例의 道號는 本號 記事란 上으로 道記事란 下으로 따로따로 갈너노앗든것을 그도 넘우 規則的이요 制限的인 感이 잇셔서 이번은 本號거니 道號거니 막 混同編輯을 하얏슴니다. 그래야 記事 그것도 生氣가 잇고 讀者도 또한 支離치 안을 것을 우리는 覺破하얏슴니다.
特히 平北人士에게 한말슴 드리는 것은 平北道號라 하면서 踏査한 그 全體를 그대로 한꺼번에 發表하지 못하게 된 그것이외다. 內容을 보시면 알겟지요만은 이번은 納凉號라 特히 서늘한 記事를 만히 擇하얏고 또한 慶北 未盡의 記事를 添入케 되얏싸오매 面數의 太過로 不得己 平北의 半部 卽 趙基栞君의 踏査한 全部는 來 9月號에야 發表케 되얏소이다. 朴達成君의 國境踏査記와 對岸同胞狀況記 아울너. 寬恕하시고 9月號까지 기다려 주실밧게 업소이다.
