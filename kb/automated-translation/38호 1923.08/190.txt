Tonghŭng Middle School in Pukgando, which currently has over 700 enrolled students, has been seeking a way to maintain itself by looking to the brothers in the Korean mainland (內地). Several people related to the school have already been touring various parts of the Land of Hibiscus (槿域) for years. It is reported that one of them, Mr. Ch'oe Myŏngho (崔明昊氏), unfortunately suffered serious injuries while previously touring Hwanghae Province, and his life is in critical condition.

When I think about how, among fellow compatriots (同胞) who similarly suffered hardship abroad (國外) and entered the Korean mainland for the same purpose, the brothers who recently came from Hawai'i (布哇) are raising their hoped-for funds amidst unprecedented cheers in every place they pass through, starting with Kyŏngsŏng, while the brothers from Pukgando wander by themselves amidst indifference, and now one has suffered serious injuries, tears of emotion flow freely (感淚가 縱橫).<78>

**Summary**

The article reports on the difficult fundraising efforts of Tonghŭng Middle School, located in Pukgando (North Jiandao, Manchuria) with 700 students. Representatives have been touring mainland Korea for years seeking financial support. One representative, Ch'oe Myŏngho, was seriously injured in Hwanghae Province. The author contrasts this harsh reality with the warm reception and successful fundraising experienced by Koreans recently returning from Hawai'i, lamenting the indifference shown towards the Pukgando group and the suffering they endure. For historians, this piece highlights the financial struggles of Korean educational institutions established outside the peninsula during the colonial period, the reliance on support from mainland Korea, and the potentially disparate treatment and reception faced by Koreans returning or seeking aid from different diaspora communities (Manchuria vs. Hawai'i). It underscores the hardships faced by activists and educators from the northern border regions.
