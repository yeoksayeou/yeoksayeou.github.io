Industry of North P'yŏngan: Agriculture, Industry, Commerce, Livestock, Forestry, Mining

Preface
In North P'yŏngan (平北), due to its many mountainous areas and few plains, coupled with barren land, inconvenient transportation, and unfavorable water transport, all industries including agriculture, industry, and commerce have traditionally been stagnant. Agricultural products consist mostly (70-80%) of chestnuts, soybeans, and corn from slash-and-burn fields (火田) and some flat fields. Commerce, except for a few areas along the railway lines, consists mostly of small retail businesses. Industry is particularly insignificant due to a lack of capital, technology, raw materials, and other factors. Fisheries are also unfavorable as it is largely continental. However, compared to other provinces, what could be called superior are livestock farming or perhaps sericulture, and also mining. Here, the industrial situation of North P'yŏngan will be presented sequentially based on statistics.

I. Agriculture <68>

Number of farmers, cultivated land area

Major crops, special crops
As shown above, North P'yŏngan's agricultural products include over 560,000 *sŏk* of rice, over 810,000 *sŏk* of chestnuts, over 380,000 *sŏk* of corn, and 370,000 *sŏk* of soybeans. Among these products, a considerable amount of rice and soybeans are exported to other regions. The destinations and volumes of these exports are as follows:

As shown above, the export of rice to other regions reaches over 254,000 *sŏk*, and the export of soybeans to other regions reaches over 254,000 *sŏk*, truly spreading the name of an agricultural country to the world, despite the barren land. Since there are generally no other industries, looking at the annual import/export tables reveals an excessive amount of imports, leading everyone to cry out about their lack of means to live. Especially in recent years, as lands were designated as state-owned or under the jurisdiction of the Forestry Bureau (營林敞), the slash-and-burn farming (火田), which mountain farmers practiced freely, has been strictly prohibited, making the cries of the lower-class farmers even more pitiful.
However, as the statistics above show, the farmers cultivate the land, feed themselves, use the products, and still export to other regions, so one cannot lament a shortage of rice or land. It is only the lack of everything else that should be lamented.

I. Livestock
In areas with many mountains, there is plenty of feed for livestock. Even if animals are grazed on grasslands or let loose in mountain valleys, they can eat well and grow well. Looking at the livestock farming methods of the Chinese in Manchuria, livestock farming in mountainous regions is quite free and easy. In Korea, Hamgyŏng and P'yŏngan provinces produce the most cattle and horses, and those from Hamgyŏng and P'yŏngan are considered the largest and strongest, largely for this reason. Here are the statistics for livestock production and exports: <69>

Livestock and Poultry, Market Sales Volume, Cattle and Pig Slaughter

The general situation of livestock is as described above. Livestock products exported extensively to other regions include cattle hides (over 538,000 *kŭn* annually, valued at over 210,000 *wŏn*), cattle bones (over 450,000 *kŭn*, valued at over 16,000 *wŏn*), beef tallow (over 140,000 *kŭn*, valued at over 29,000 *wŏn*), pig bristles (over 50,000 *kŭn*, valued at over 10,000 *wŏn*). Other exports like pork lard, honey, beeswax, milk, etc., reach nearly 300,000 *wŏn*, indicating significant production from household farming. Furthermore,

The status of Sericulture and Tussah Silkworm Farming
shows that combining spring and autumn silkworms produces 1,639 *sŏk* annually, yielding a value of over 587,900 *wŏn*. This is also a considerable income. Tussah silkworms also produce over 33,000 *sŏk* annually, yielding a value of over 333,300 *wŏn*. This too can be considered income not found in other provinces.

I. Fisheries
Considering the small sea area, the fishing industry cannot be said to be that small. Important products include croaker, cod, shrimp, shad, icefish, mackerel pike, hairtail, meagre, and other fish. The catch volume reaches over 2,279,000 *kwan*, and the total value related to fishing reaches over 1,040,000 *wŏn*. In the coastal areas, 2,078 households make a living from fishing.

I. Commerce
Not just in North P'yŏngan Province, but throughout Korea, there is little to record regarding commerce and industry run by Koreans. In North P'yŏngan, transportation is particularly inconvenient. Areas with the convenience of water transport on the Amnok (Yalu) and Ch'ŏngch'ŏn rivers, or the railway between Pakch'ŏn and Ŭiju, might be slightly developed, but other mountainous regions rely merely on packhorses and human porters for itinerant trade and small retail. <70> Speaking of the commerce-centered society, there are 34 companies involved in agriculture, commerce, industry, mining, fisheries, transport, banking, electricity, etc., with a total capital reaching 77 million *wŏn* and annual net profits exceeding 8 million *wŏn*. However, most of these are managed by foreigners, and Korean management is scarce. Even when present, it is merely auxiliary or subordinate to foreigners. Although several unions or stock companies have been established, they have all met with failure. In various markets and large streets, Koreans act merely as brokers, itinerant traders, or small retailers under the pressure of foreigners or capital and large merchants from Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul) and P'yŏngyang. Therefore, there is nothing special to note regarding the Korean commercial world. Here is a brief summary of the annual import/export statistics for commerce in North P'yŏngan:

As shown above, in the 10th year of Taishō (1921), the import surplus for Sinŭiju alone was 1,139,775 *wŏn*, and the import surplus for Yongamp'o was over 135,000 *wŏn*. Who suffers the poisonous effects of this import surplus? Only Koreans. It seems that in just a few years, they will lose their homes and land, become destitute beggars, and have no choice but to wander east and west. Even for a single year's surplus, there is truly nothing to compensate for its value, so what can be done about the huge amounts exceeded year after year? Is there anything other than land to pay the price? In the 8th year of Taishō (1919), the import surplus was 8.8 million *wŏn*, and in the 9th year (1920), it is said to have exceeded 14.6 million *wŏn*. Outwardly, people struggle as if to survive, but internally, it is said that exhaustion, no, destruction, is imminent. The question of countermeasures against this is left to the local figures.

I. Industry
The industrial sector is also much the same; how could there be a different way? Compared to other provinces, raw materials might be abundant and wages low, but capital is inherently scarce and technology lacking. What can be done? There are over 150 factories, including rice mills, hulling factories, lumber mills, printing shops, textile factories, ceramic workshops, shipyards, and tile factories, with over 5,000 employees <71> and an annual production value reaching over 13 million *wŏn*. However, 80-90% of these are managed by foreigners. Korean-managed operations are typically limited to ironworking (blacksmithing), tile making, brassware making, raw silk production, hemp cloth, cotton cloth, shoe making, rope, straw mats, and other straw products. These are mostly side businesses or for household use, and gaining income through exports is extremely rare. However, due to the abundance of raw materials and many workers, the results are not that poor. Among these, noteworthy items are:
Raw silk: over 483,000 *wŏn* annually

The total annual income for Koreans in industry indeed reaches a considerable sum of over 10,815,000 *wŏn*. Adding the annual income of Japanese (over 2,803,000 *wŏn*) <72> and Chinese (over 75,000 *wŏn*), the total annual income from industry in North P'yŏngan reaches over 13,695,000 *wŏn*. It is said that in the 9th year of Taishō (1920), it was 14.96 million *wŏn*, and in the 10th year of Taishō (1921), it was 17,357,419 *wŏn*. Is the general state of industry, considering the current situation, perhaps not that insignificant?

I. Mining
Let's not even talk about it. North P'yŏngan's mineral products are indeed famous not only in Korea but worldwide, but these too are all in the hands of foreigners. The famous Pukchin Gold Mine in Unsan and the Taeyudong Gold Mine in Ch'angsŏng—those belong to foreigners. Others belong to the Japanese. While there are several mining claims belonging to Koreans, many have been abandoned due to lack of capital. The number of mining claims for gold, silver, copper, iron, graphite, stone materials, etc., is 284 operated by Japanese, 68 by Koreans, and 4 by other foreigners. However, the 68 Korean claims do not amount to even one-tenth of the 4 foreign claims, and they certainly cannot compare to the 280 Japanese-operated claims. Lacking knowledge, lacking gold (capital), lacking everything—the core resources are all taken away, and our brothers pitifully and powerlessly scrape leftovers or work on the periphery. This situation is truly suffocating. Nevertheless, let's present the mining statistics table. <73>

I. Forestry
The province's forest land covers approximately 80% (2,395,316 *chōbo*) of the total area. Within this, forested land (成林地) constitutes only about one-third (878,892 *chōbo*). However, a large portion belongs to the Yalu River basin, offering transportation convenience. Furthermore, within these forested areas, places like Wiwŏn, Kanggye, Chasŏng, and Wŏnch'ang (likely Huch'ang) belong to the jurisdiction of the Forestry Bureau (營林敞) and are renowned worldwide for their abundant timber. Indeed, the forests along the Yalu River coast are called treasures of the world. <74>

**Summary**

This 1923 article provides a statistical overview of the primary industries in North P'yŏngan Province (P'yŏngbuk) during the Japanese colonial period: agriculture, livestock, fisheries, commerce, industry, mining, and forestry. While acknowledging some strengths like livestock, sericulture, mining resources, and vast forests (especially along the Yalu), the author laments the overall stagnation and underdevelopment due to geographical disadvantages and, more critically, the overwhelming dominance of foreign (primarily Japanese) capital and management. Agriculture suffers from land policies restricting traditional farming (*hwajŏn*), commerce faces crippling trade deficits benefiting foreigners, industry relies heavily on foreign enterprises despite local potential, and highly valuable mining and forestry resources are controlled by outsiders, leaving Koreans marginalized and facing economic hardship ("exhaustion, no, destruction, is imminent").

From a historical perspective, the article is revealing for its candid portrayal of the colonial economy's structure and impact. It highlights the extraction of resources (minerals, timber), the marginalization of Korean entrepreneurs and labourers, the detrimental effects of specific colonial policies (like *hwajŏn* prohibition and Forestry Bureau control), and the growing economic dependence symbolized by the massive trade deficit. Historians would find the detailed statistics (though needing cross-verification) on production, trade, capital, and ownership across various sectors valuable for understanding the economic realities and Korean perspectives on exploitation in this region during the early 1920s. The author's tone of concern and critique of the situation provides insight into contemporary Korean sentiment regarding their economic plight under Japanese rule.

平北의 産業, 農·工·商·畜·林·鑛
緖言
平北은 그 地方이 山岳이 多하고 平野가 少함에 土地의 薄瘠 交通의 不便 水運의 不利 여러 가지 關係로 農工商 其他 모든 産業이 自來로 不振하야왓다. 農産이라야 火田半平田半에 栗, 大豆, 玉蜀黍 갓흔 것이 10의 7, 8分이고 商業이라야 鐵道 沿邊 幾個地方을 除한 外에 擧皆 小賣商에 不過하고 工業은 더구나 資本 技術, 原料, 其他의 不及으로 보잘 것 업고 水産이 또한 大陸的인지라 不利하다. 다만 他道에 比하야 그나마 優越하달 것은 畜産 又는 양잠갓흔 것이며 又는 鑛産 그것이겟다. 玆에 平北의 産業界를 順次로 統計에 依하야 示할 것 갓흐면

一. 農業＜68＞

농업자수, 경지면적

중요작물, 특수작물
右와 如히 平北의 農産物로는 米가 56萬餘 石 栗이 81萬餘 石 玉蜀黍 38萬餘 石 大豆가 37萬石이 産出되는 바 右 産物 中 米와 大豆 갓흔 것은 外地의 輸出이 不少하니 그- 輸出地 及 輸出高를 示하면

右와 如히 米의 外地輸出이 25萬 4千餘 石 大豆의 外他輸出 25萬 4千餘 石에 達하야 土薄하나마 實로 農業國의 號를 世界에 傳한다. 代로 他業이 無하니 1年의 輸出入表를 計하면 輸移入이 太過하야 모다 生活의 末由를 呌號한다. 더구나 近年에 至하야는 國有地이니 營林敞 所管地이니 하야 山間 農民의 自由耕作이든 火田을 嚴禁하니 下農들의 呌號하는 情地가 더욱 可憐하게 되얏다.
그러나 右의 統計와 갓치 그 土地에서 그 農民이 耕作하야 食之用之하고도 外地에 輸出을 하나니 米不足 地不足의 嘆은 못하겟다. 다른 모든 것이 不及하니 不及處 그것뿐 嘆할 뿐이겟다.

一. 畜産
山多處는 家畜의 飼料가 多하다. 초원에 放畜하거나 山谷에 開放을 한다 하더래도 能히 食하고 能히 長하니 彼 滿洲의 中國人 家畜法을 본다 해도 山地의 畜産이란 꽤 自由스럽고 容易한 것이다. 朝鮮으로 말하면 咸鏡 平安에서 牛馬의 産高가 其中 多하고 肥壯하기도 咸平을 第一 치는 것은 大槪 그- 까닭이다. 玆에 그- 家畜의 産高 及 輸出高를 示하면＜69＞

家畜家禽, 시장매매수, 屠牛屠豚

家畜의 槪況은 右와 如하거니와 畜産物로 外地에 만히 輸出되는 것은 牛皮가 年 53萬8천餘 斤 價額 21만여 원 牛骨이 45만여 斤 가액 1萬 6千餘 圓 牛脂가 14萬 餘 斤 價額 2萬 9千餘 圓 豚毛가 5萬餘 斤 價額 萬餘 圓 其他 豚脂, 蜂蜜, 蜜蠟 牛乳 等 移出額이 實로 近 30萬圓에 達하야 家産으로의 生産이 不少하다 기타

養蠶 及 柞蠶의 狀況
을 示하면 春蠶 秋蠶 統트러 年 1,639石을 産하야 價額 587,900餘 圓을 得하니 此가 亦 不少한 收入이며 柞蠶이 또한 年 33,000餘 石을 産하야 價額 333,300餘 圓을 得하니 此 亦 他道에 無한 收入이라 하겟다.

一. 水産
水産業은 海面이 少함애 比하야 그닥 적다 할 수 업나니 其中 重要産物이 石首魚 火魚 蝦 鰣 白魚 鯖鰡 太刀魚 鮸 下魚 等이고 數量高로도 227萬9千餘貫이 出하고 漁業에 對한 總價額이 104萬餘 圓에 達하야 沿海地方은 漁業으로 生計를 得하는 者- 2,078戶에 達한다.

一. 商業
平安北道뿐이 안이라 朝鮮을 通하야 朝鮮人의 商工業이라 할 것은 別로 記錄할 것이 업다. 平北운 더구나 交通이 不便하야 鴨江 淸川江의 水運의 便 又는 博川 義州間의 鐵道便이 有한 地方은 稍히 發達되야슬가 하나 其他 山地난 馬背 人背에 依한 行商 小賣에 不過하다. 商業을＜70＞ 中心한 社會로 말한다해도 農, 商, 工, 鑛業, 水産, 運輸, 銀行, 電氣 等 諸會社가 34個所가 잇고 資本金도 統히 7千7百萬圓에 達하고 年 純益金도 800萬圓 以上에 達한다 하나 이 모든 것이 外國人의 經營이요 朝鮮人의 經營은 적다. 잇다해도 外國人에게 附屬的 從屬的에 不過하고 又는 幾個所의 組合 或은 株式形으로 會社를 設하얏다 하나 擧皆 敗北을 當하고 各 市場 及 巨里에서 外國人 又는 京城 平壤 資本 及 大商主의 압에서 居間 又는 行商 小賣商에 不過하니 朝鮮人 商業界를 擧하야는 特記할 것이 업고 玆에 平北 商業에 對한 年 輸出入의 統計를 畧示하면

右와 如히 大正 10年度의 新義州에 對한 移入超過만 해도 1,139,775圓이요 龍岩浦의 移入 超過가 135,000餘 圓이니 이 移入 超過의 害毒은 누가 밧으랴. 오직 朝鮮人 뿐이니 不過 幾年에 집이고 땅이고 統트러 밧치고 赤裸裸한 거지가 되야 東西에 流離할 外 他道가 업서 보인다. 1年의 超過만 해도 實로 그 代價를 補할 만한 아무 것이 업는데 况且 年年히 超過되는 그 巨額에야 엇지 하랴. 土地 밧게 代價할 것이 업지 안이하랴. 大正 8年만 해도 移入 超過가 880萬圓이 되고 9年에는 1,460餘 萬圓이나 超過가 되얏다 한다. 外面으로는 그래도 살겟다고 허덕허덕하나 內面을 보면 枯渴 안이 滅亡이 目前에 迫하얏다 한다. 此에 對한 對策 如何는 地方人士에게 任하고 만다.

一. 工業
工業界 또한 그럿치 別道理가 잇으랴. 他道에 比하야 原料도 풍부하고 勞賃도 低廉하다 할 수 이스나 本來 資本이 乏하고 技術이 不及하니 奈何오. 精米工場이니 籾摺工場이니 製材 印刷 織物 窯業 製船 製瓦 等 工場數가 150餘 開所가 되고 從業者도 5千餘 名이＜71＞ 되고 年産額이 1千3百餘 萬圓에 達한다 하나 그 亦 外國人의 經營이 10에 8, 9요 朝鮮人의 經營이란 例의 鐵工(冶匠) 製瓦 鍮器 生絲 麻布 棉布 製鞋 繩 叭 筵 等 藁製品 等이 이슬 뿐이다. 此亦 副業的 自家用이 太半이요 移出을 식켜서 收入을 得함은 極키 少數이다. 그러나 그- 原料가 多하고 從業者가 多함애 따라 그 成績이 그닥 不良하지는 안이 하니 其中 特記할 것은
生絲로 年 483,000餘 圓 棉布로 1,050,000餘 圓 麻布로 730,000餘 圓 絹布로 410,000餘 圓 도자기로 45,000餘 圓 素燒器로 118,000餘 圓 土管으로 10萬餘 圓 瓦로 11萬8千餘 圓 石灰로 4萬2千餘圓 金銀細工으로 4萬5千餘 圓 鐵鑄物로 29萬2千餘 圓 刃物로 4萬餘 圓 眞鍮器로 29萬4千餘 圓 烟管으로 3萬6千餘 圓 金屬製品이 5萬2千餘 圓 木器品이 9千餘 圓 硯石으로 1,800餘 圓 指物로 8萬2千餘 圓 挽物로 1萬4千圓 朝鮮木履로 1萬6千餘 圓 漆器로 2千圓 柳杞製品이 2萬7千圓 莞草品이 2萬3千圓 芦草筵이 20萬7千圓 竹皮 及 木皮蓆이 1萬7千餘 圓 在來筵으로 10萬6千여 원 改良叭 及 繩으로 17萬餘 圓 朝鮮草鞋로 19萬8千餘 圓 筆로 1萬6千圓 笠子로 1萬6千餘 圓 冠 宕巾 網巾으로 5萬9千餘 圓 農笠 喪笠으로 1萬4千餘 圓 朝鮮麻鞋로 51萬4千餘 圓 布帛로 112萬圓 *只로 17萬7千餘 圓 吐手로 27萬3千餘 圓 袋物로 1萬9千圓 農具로 7萬5千餘 圓 양잠구로 1萬9千圓 牛馬具로 5萬1千圓 漁具로 2萬餘 圓 車輛 及 船舶으로 萬餘圓 燒酒로 102萬9千餘 圓 藥酒로 5勀ƒ餘圓 濁酒로 5萬9千餘 圓 麯子로 11萬圓 麥粉으로 1萬6千餘 圓 蕎麥粉으로 61萬4千餘 圓 雜穀粉으로 5萬8千餘 圓 澱粉 及 干麵類로 6千餘 圓 飴로 12萬1千餘 圓 菓子로 4千餘圓 蜂蜜 7萬7千餘 圓 鳥獸肉으로 3千餘 圓 洋靴類로 9萬8千餘 圓 牛脂 豚脂 及 漁油로 3萬4千餘 圓 蜜蠟으로 1萬3千餘 圓 荏油로 7萬9千圓 胡麻油로 6萬9千餘 圓 菎麻 及 油, 大豆 綿實油로 2萬3千餘 圓 蠟燭 千餘 圓 漆液으로 千餘 圓 豆, 油, 醬油, 燒酌糟로 7千餘 圓 其他 植物質 肥料로 24萬9千餘 圓 過燐酸 其他 鑛物質 肥料로 3萬餘圓 그- 年收入額이 實로 不少하니 工業에 對한 朝鮮人 年 統計가 1,081萬 5千餘 圓에 達한다. 此에 日本人 年 收入 280萬3千餘 圓＜72＞中國人 年 收入 7萬5千餘 圓을 合하면 工業에 對한 平北 1年 收入이 1,369萬5千餘 圓에 達한다. 大正 9年은 1,496萬圓이고 大正10年은 1,735萬7千4百19圓이라 하니 工業의 大槪가 아직 形便으로는 그닥 虛少하지는 안을넌지?

一. 鑛業
더구나 말도 말자 平北의 鑛産物이야 그야말로 朝鮮뿐 안이라 世界的 名産地이다만은 그것도 다- 外國人의 手에 由한 것이다. 彼- 有名한 雲山의 北鎭 金鑛 昌城의 大楡洞 金鑛 그것이다.- 外國人의 것이고 其他의 것은 日本人이 것이고 朝鮮人의 것이란 幾個區가 잇다 하나 亦 資本不及으로 廢鑛한 것이 만타. 金 銀 銅 鐵 黑鉛 石災 等 鑛區數가 日本人 經營이 284個所 조선인 경영이 68개소 외국인 경영이 4개소가 되나 조선인의 68個所는 外國人 4個所의 10分 1에도 不及하며 日本人 經營 280個所와는 더구나 比見할 수도 업다. 知不及金不及 總히 不及되니 骨子는 다- 앗기우고 下瀝 又는 邊方에서 만엄을 엄을 하는 우리 兄弟의 可憐 無能한 情景이야말로 氣- 塞하도다. 그럿타 하고 鑛山表나 揭하야 보면＜73＞

一. 林業
本道의 林野는 總面積의 約 8割(2,395,316町步) 占하얏다. 其內 成林地는 그의 約 3分 1 (878,892町步)에 不過하나 有大部分은 鴨綠江 流域에 屬한 것으로 運輸의 便이 有하며 又는 此等 成林地의 內渭原, 江界, 慈城, 原昌 等地는 營林敞 所管에 屬하야 材木이 豊富한 것으로 世界에 名하니 實로 鴨江 沿岸의 山林은 世界의 寶라 稱한다.＜74＞
