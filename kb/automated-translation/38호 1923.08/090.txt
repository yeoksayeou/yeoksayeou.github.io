Corrigenda

In the commemorative advertisement for the 3rd anniversary of the founding in the July issue of this magazine, the following are errors: Yang Yunkŭn (楊潤根) of Hamhŭng should be Yang Yunkŭn (楊閏根). Pak Sŏkha (朴錫夏) should be Pak Yongha (朴鎔夏). Ch'oe Kyusŏng (崔奎成) should be Ch'oe Kyusŏng (崔圭成). Kim Yŏngt'ae Lumber Store (金永泰 材木店) should be Kim Yŏngsu Lumber Store (金永壽 材木店). Kim Sŏkhyŏn (金錫鉉) should be Kim Sŏkhyŏn (金錫炫). Wŏn Sŭryŏp (元膝燁) should be Wŏn Tŭngyŏp (元滕曄).

Also in the same advertisement, the name of the proprietor, Mr. Ch'a Myŏnggŏn (車明鍵), was omitted from the entry for the General Goods Trading Company Head (雜貨貿易商長) outside South Gate (南門 外), P'yŏngyang-bu (平壤府), Telephone 733, Postal Transfer Kyŏngsŏng 12,281. It is hereby corrected.<41>

**Summary**

This article is a list of corrections (errata) for mistakes made in a commemorative advertisement published in the previous month's (July 1923) issue of *Kaebyŏk* magazine, celebrating its third anniversary. The corrections mostly involve fixing miswritten Hanja characters in individuals' names and one business name, and adding the name of a proprietor that was accidentally omitted from an advertisement listing. From a historical perspective, this notice is interesting as it provides specific names of individuals and businesses (including their locations like Hamhŭng and P'yŏngyang and details like phone numbers) who supported or advertised in a prominent Korean nationalist magazine during the colonial period. It reflects the networks of support for such publications and offers glimpses into commercial activity and the importance of correctly representing personal and business identities.
