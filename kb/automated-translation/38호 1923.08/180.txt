一高一下한 平北의 2大界
(The Two Great Realms of North P'yŏngan: One High, One Low)

1. 敎育界 (The Realm of Education)
Is it because they live hidden away in remote mountain regions, seeing nothing and hearing nothing? Is it intentional, thinking that clothing and food are sufficient for life, so what use is education? Or is it truly because life is impossible and financial means are lacking, so they cannot pursue it even if they wish? While the reasons are undoubtedly numerous, generally speaking, the educational landscape of North P'yŏngan (平北) is utterly unworthy of notice. Although it is the region where, during the Kapsin (甲辰) and Ŭlsa (乙巳) years, the sounds of Western drums were heard, and the influence of Ch'ŏndogyo (天道敎) and Christianity (耶蘇敎) greatly flourished, the state of education is completely neglected. Universities and specialized schools are out of the question, not just for North P'yŏngan, but even educational institutions of the middle school level are extremely scarce. The Sinŭiju (新義州) High Common School, established last year, stands as the sole representative government institution. Privately, the Osan School (五山學校) in Chŏngju (定州) also continues its solitary struggle. Besides these, there are only the Sinsŏng Middle School (信聖中學) in Sŏnch'ŏn (宣川) and the Sungdŏk School (崇德學校) in Nyŏngbyŏn (寧邊), both run by Christian churches. There are no others. Including public agricultural and commercial schools, in this region encompassing 1 city (府) and 19 counties (郡) with 1.3 million residents, there are fewer than 5 or 6 middle-level schools. Beyond that, there are only ordinary elementary schools (尋常小學) standardized for Japanese children and public common schools (公立普校) standardized for Korean children – essentially training centers for policemen (巡査), county hirelings (郡雇員), and township clerks (面書記). Even these are not numerous. With great difficulty, there is barely one school per three townships (面), or even one per four townships. There isn't a single educational institution for girls; if there is one, it might be an attached facility run as a side business by some other school. Although there are said to be independent girls' educational institutions run by Christian churches in Sŏnch'ŏn and Nyŏngbyŏn, they are not noteworthy.

Nevertheless, along the railway lines, thanks perhaps to more exposure and convenient transportation, there are quite a few graduates from middle school or higher, and there are currently students studying in Kyŏngsŏng (京城) or abroad, so it is not entirely desolate. However, in those mountain counties like Chasŏng (慈城), Huch'ang (厚昌), Wiwŏn (渭原), Ch'osan (楚山), Ch'angsŏng (昌城), and Sakchu (朔州), it is common not even to know the terms "studying abroad" or "middle school or higher." To give a real example, when I went to Chasŏng and asked the assembled county leaders and influential figures, "How many schools are there in your esteemed county?" they only replied, "There are three public common schools, including the one in the county seat (邑內), and one private school." When asked, "How many graduates from middle school or higher<75> are there?" they looked at each other, hesitated for a while, and then said, "Perhaps there isn't even one." When asked again, "How many students are currently studying abroad in places like Kyŏngsŏng or foreign countries?" they replied, "There isn't a single one." Throughout the entire county, past and present, there is reportedly not a single person with middle-level knowledge. They must have been dumbfounded, but the listening reporter could only stand there with his mouth agape. When asked in Ch'osan, Ch'osan was also the same. Past and present, there is only one person, a Mr. Ham (咸某), who studied in Kyŏngsŏng and graduated from middle school or higher. Ch'angsŏng is the same, and Sakchu is likewise.

Thus, the educational world of North P'yŏngan is utterly insignificant. However, perhaps due to greater exposure and convenient transportation, the areas along the railway line seem not quite so sparse. Looking at the statistics for students studying abroad,

Excluding students studying domestically in places like Kyŏngsŏng or P'yŏngyang (平壤), there are 240 students studying in Japan (日本), China (中國), the United States (米國), etc., across all fields. While this cannot be called satisfactory, it cannot be said to be a small number either.
Next, looking at the general education statistics within the province,

There are 70 common schools (普通學校), over 100 miscellaneous private schools (私立 雜種 學校), and over 2,200 village schools (書堂). The total number of students receiving education barely exceeds 37,000. Compared to North P'yŏngan's population of 1.23 million, this doesn't even amount to 1 out of every 33 people. Furthermore, if we exclude Japanese children and also Korean children attending village schools (書堂) (who are not considered to be receiving formal education), how many <76> people are actually receiving purely common education? It might barely reach a ratio of 1 per 40 people. Living like this, can they possibly acquire the right to survive in this world where survival depends on knowledge and money? I urge the thoughtful people of North P'yŏngan to consider this.

2. 宗敎界 (The Realm of Religion)
More than anything, what is somewhat noteworthy in North P'yŏngan is the Realm of Religion. The religious world is far more advanced compared to other provinces. As Lao Tzu said, "The highest knowers know the teaching, the middle knowers oppose the teaching, the lowest knowers believe the teaching." Perhaps because North P'yŏngan has many in the knowledgeable class (知者階級), or perhaps because it has many in the ignorant class (不知者階級), or perhaps because they are inherently a religious people – whatever the reason, the religious world is flourishing, truly flourishing. In county after county, there are Ch'ŏndogyo (天道敎) halls and Christian (耶蘇敎) churches; in township after township, there are mission halls (傳敎堂) and chapels (禮拜堂). Thus, the sounds of chanting incantations (呪文) and hymns (讚美) can be heard everywhere, and one frequently encounters people carrying religious texts (敎書) or clutching Bibles (聖經). Seeing that the people are generally simple and kind (淳厚), polite (人事性 잇고), and not entirely ignorant, one can well gauge the effects of religious cultivation, or rather, the power of religion. One can also clearly see that their abundant hopefulness (希望心) and strong sense of community (集團性) are also due to the influence of religion. During Kapsin (甲辰) and Ŭlsa (乙巳), they took the lead in progressive movements, and during the March First Movement (己未事件), their actions were far more decisive compared to those without religion. And observing their society now, one can clearly sense that some latent power (潛勢力) or great hope (大希望) lies dormant within them. Thus, while crying out about the impossibility of making a living in a poor region, they show not the slightest sign of slackening (解弛之端) regarding the religion they believe in. They constantly gather and convene (相會輪集) to study something, accumulate something, and also love and support each other (相愛相扶), forming a kind of ideal community (理想團) and implicitly waiting earnestly (苦待) for some opportunity (機會何時來). Whether it is the resurrection of Jesus (耶蘇 復活),<77> a water judgment (水審判), a fire judgment (火審判), or perhaps a world where all under heaven follow Ch'ŏndogyo and everyone chants incantations (天下皆天道 人皆頌呪), or perhaps independence (獨立) or communism (共産) – whatever it may be, it is a fact that they are individually and collectively bound together in suspicion and connection (疑結相聯), hoping for something and refining their minds and bodies (心身을 磨鍊) to achieve that hope. Of course, there may be superstition (迷信) and blind faith (盲目) among them, but it is also a fact that this is the customary way (依例套) of religious people. Now, to show the statistics for each religion:
[Statistics table likely appeared here in the original magazine]
The statistics are generally as above, but since they are based on the end of Taishō 10 (1921), subsequent changes are unknown. Also, given the recent proliferation of religious manufacturers (종교제조업자), it is factual that various sects (別別 敎派) must be numerous. Furthermore, since the statistics are generally based on government counts (官廳의 計), their accuracy cannot be guaranteed. <78>

**Summary**

The article contrasts the state of education and religion in North P'yŏngan Province in 1923. It laments the extremely poor condition of the education system, highlighting the scarcity of schools (especially secondary and for girls), the lack of qualified individuals in remote areas, and the low overall enrollment rate compared to the population. The system is criticized as inadequate, primarily serving Japanese needs or training low-level Korean functionaries. In stark contrast, the religious sphere, dominated by Ch'ŏndogyo and Christianity, is described as flourishing and significantly more developed than in other provinces. The author notes the strong community bonds, hopefulness, and potential for collective action among religious adherents, linking their faith to past nationalist movements and suggesting a latent energy awaiting an opportunity, whether religious or political (like independence). For historians, this article offers a valuable snapshot of colonial realities: the deliberate underdevelopment of meaningful Korean education by the Japanese administration versus the role of religious organizations as centers of community, identity, and potentially subtle resistance or hope during a period of oppression. The mention of specific schools, statistics (however flawed), and the stark regional disparities within the province provide concrete details about social conditions.

一高一下한 平北의 2大界
一. 敎育界
山間癖地에 隱居하야 보는 것이 업고 듯는 것이 업서 그리함인지 衣食이면 能生活이지 敎育은 何所用고 하야 故意로 그리함인지 政말 生活이 末由하고 金力이 不及하야 하고 십허도 못하는지 그- 原因이 無論 多端하겟지만 大軆로 보아 平北의 敎育界란 아조 擧目의 値가 업다. 甲辰乙巳에 洋鼓소리만츰 나고 天道, 耶蘇에 敎風이 大振한다 하는 그 地方이지만 敎育狀况이란 아조 䟽忽하다. 大學이니 專門이니 그는 平北뿐만 안이닛가 말할 것 업고 중등程度의 敎育機關조차도 其數가 퍽 零星하니 昨年에 施設된 新義州高等普通學校 그것이 官立을 代表한 孤立機關이요 私立으로 定州에 五山學校가 亦是 孤立的 奮鬪를 繼續할 뿐이고 其他 耶蘇敎會 經營인 宣川의 信聖中學과 寧邊의 崇德學校가 有할 뿐이다. 其外에는 업다. 公立農校 及 商校까지 편입하야 1府 19郡 130萬이 居住하는 그 地方에 中等級 學校가 5, 6個所에 不及한다. 그리고는 日本 兒童을 標準한 尋常小學 朝鮮 兒童을 標準한 公立普校 卽 巡査 養成所 郡雇員 面書記 敎習所 그것이 이슬 뿐이다. 이것도 多數는 못된다. 艱辛히 3面  1校 안이 4面 1校에 不過한다. 女子敎育機關이란 一個所도 업고 잇다하면 엇던 學校의 附屬으로 餘事로 하는 그것일넌지 宣川 寧邊에 耶蘇敎의 獨立的 女子敎育機關이 잇다 하나 擧目할 것이 업다.
그나마 鐵道 沿邊은 제법 中等 이상의 卒業者들도 잇고 現在 京城 或 外國 留學生들도 이셔서 그리 消寂하지는 안타만은 저- 慈城, 厚昌, 渭原, 楚山, 昌城, 朔州 等 山邑에는 留學이 무엇이고 中等 以上이 무엇인지 그- 名辭 뿐도 몰으는 것이 普通이라. 實例를 들면 慈城을 가슬 때에 郡民有力者 總集中에서 貴郡의 學校는 幾個所냐 무르니 公立普通이 邑內까지 3個所고 私立이 1個所라 할 뿐이고 中等 以上 卒業者는＜75＞ 幾人이냐 무르니 面面相顧에 한참 주저하다가 아마 1人도 업나 보외다 할 뿐이고 또 뭇기를 現在 京城이나 外國 等地로 나아간 留學生은 幾人이냐 무르니 亦 1人도 업다 한다. 擧郡을 通하야 過去 現在에 中等知識者가 1人도 업다 한다. 그들도 氣가 막키겟지만 듯는 記者도 입을 딸 벌닐 밧게 업섯다. 楚山서 무르니 楚山 亦是 그러하다. 過去 現在에 京城 留學으로 中等 以上 卒業자가 咸某 1人뿐이라 한다. 昌城도 그럿코 朔州도 同樣이다.
이러케 平北의 敎育界란 아조 보잘 것이 업다. 그러나 견문이 만코 交通이 便한 德인지 鐵道 沿岸은 그닥 零星치는 안은 모양이다. 留學生 統計票를 보면

京城이나 平壤 等 內地 留學生은 말고 日本, 中國, 米國 等地에 留學生이 全科를 通하야 240名이나 되니 滿足다 할 수는 업지만 그* 少數라고는 못하겟다.
그 다음 本道 內의 一般 敎育 統計表를 보면

普通學校 70個所 私立 雜種 學校 100餘 개소 書堂 2,200餘 個所 彼敎育者數가 統트러 37,000 餘名에 不過하다. 平北의 인구 123萬에 比하야 보면 33人에 1名式도 못 도라간다. 게다가 日本 兒童을 除하고 또 朝鮮의 書堂 兒童(彼敎育者라 認定치 안이함)을 除하고 보면 純然是普通敎育이나 밧는 者가 멧 名이나＜76＞ 되는가 말이다. 40名에 對한 1名 比例가 될가 말가 하니 이러하고도 能히 知와 金으로써 生存해 가는 이 世上에서 生存權을 어들 수 잇슬가. 平北 人士의 一考察을 願한다.

2. 宗敎界
무엿보다도 平北에서 그 中 눈 드러볼 만한 것은 宗敎界이다. 宗敎界는 他道에 比하야 훨신 進步되얏다. 老子 所謂 上知者는 知敎 中知者는 反敎 下知者는 信敎라 함과 가티 平北에는 知者階級이 만하 그런지 不知者階級이 만하 그런지 本來 宗敎性이 만흔 民族인지 如何間 宗敎界는 興盛 興盛하다. 郡과 郡에 天道敎堂 耶蘇敎堂이 잇고 面과 面에 傳敎堂 禮拜堂이 잇다. 그러하야 呪文소리 讚美소리 到處에서 드를 수 잇고 敎書 든 이 聖經 낀 이를 重重 만날 수 잇다. 그리하야 사람들이 大槪 淳厚하고 人事性 잇고 또 그리 無識지 안은 것을 보면 宗敎修養 안이 宗敎의 위력을 可히 斟酌하겟고 또 希望心이 만코 集團性이 만흔 것도 이것이 宗敎의 勢力인 줄 可히 알겟다. 甲辰 乙巳에 그들은 猪進的 運動을 率先해 하얏고 己未事件에도 그들은 無宗敎界에 比하야 훨신 決斷的 行動을 하얏다. 그러고 現在 그들의 社會를 窺視하면 무엇인지 潛勢力 안이 大希望이 伏在하얏슴을 可히 알 수 잇다. 그리하야 貧寒한 地方에서 生活의 末由를 叫號하면서도 名히 그- 所信하는 宗敎에 對하야는 少毫도 解弛之端이 업다. 그리고 늘- 相會輪集하야 무엇을 講究하며 무엇을 積置하며 또 相愛相扶하야 一種의 理想團을 構成하고 機會何時來를 隱然히 苦待하고 잇다. 耶蘇 復活인지＜77＞ 水審判인지 火審判인지 또는 天下皆天道 人皆頌呪인지 또 或은 獨立인지 共産인지 如何間 個人 團體的으로 疑結相聯하야 무엇을 希望하고 그 希望을 成就하기에 心身을 磨鍊하는 것이 事實이다. 勿論 그들 중에는 迷信도 잇고 盲目도 잇겟지만 엇잿든 宗敎家의 依例套임도 事實이다. 이제 그- 各 宗敎의 統計를 示하면
大槪 以上과 가트나 統計가 大正 10年 末을 棕準한 것이닛가 其後의 변동은 不知하겟고 또한 종교제조업자가 熾盛한 昨今이닛가 別別 敎派가 만흘 것도 事實이다. 그리고 統計의 大槪가 官廳의 計에 依한 것이닛가 그가 分明할 것을 保障키 難하다.＜78＞
