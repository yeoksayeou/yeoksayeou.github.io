The 1 Prefecture and 7 Counties of the Border I Saw
						Talsŏng

A Word

When one speaks of the nine towns along the river—Ŭiju, Sakchu, Ch'angsŏng, Pyŏktong, Ch'osan, Wiwŏn, Kanggye, Chasŏng, Huch'ang—whether viewed as the border or the riverside, it seems everything should be quite developed. Since it's the border, it should be a crossroads of culture due to historical traffic between the two countries, thus rich in historical material. And being along the famous Amnok River, even setting aside the convenience of water transport, the scenery alone should offer much to behold. However, the reality is the opposite; there is nothing much worth seeing. Why is that? Although it's called the border, in reality, it faced the most undeveloped land in the world, the wilderness of South Manchuria, and the northern side was also Korea's most backward area, the northwestern mountains. Except for Ŭiju, these places lack the value of a border region. It is said that it has only been a thousand years since the towns were established and only a few hundred years since the land was opened, so what is there to see?

Therefore, there is little worth noting historically, and current development is also not worth seeing. The only things that startle the eyes and ears of the world are the activities of the Korean independence armies, which are the biggest recent phenomenon, and the expansion of the police force, established by pouring the national treasury's resources under the names of "border security" or "defense against subversive Koreans." (Over 2,300 patrolmen, police expenses over 2.6 million Won annually). With police stations every 5 *ri*, resident police posts every 1 *ri*, and police boxes every few *chō*, wherever one sets foot, there is the sound of police swords; wherever one looks, there are the rifle muzzles of patrolmen.

Given this general situation, all culture lacks prospects for development due to inconvenient transportation and unfavorable land. The people, caught between the police and the independence army, are enveloped in fear, trembling, and panic, unable to raise their heads or stretch their legs, just passing day by day.<79> It is said there are many cases where lives, property, and even entire families are sacrificed.

Indeed, the facts are clear, but there are many facts that the mouth cannot speak and the brush cannot write. There are many facts where the mountains do not speak, the water does not speak, and people also do not speak. For anyone who has seen the riverside—who has seen the suffering endured by the people of the riverside—unless they are wood or stone, who would not feel their skin crawl and their heart grow cold?

It would be good to introduce the hidden facts and the revealed facts, as heard and seen, but leaving that for another opportunity, this time I will only write about the current reality and situation of each county.

I. The Old Border Town, Ŭiju County

Ŭiju County is a large border town at the western end of Korea, facing the Manchurian region of China. It borders Sakchu and Kusŏng to the east, Yongch'ŏn, Ch'ŏlsan, and Sŏnch'ŏn to the southeast, and faces Andong and Kwandian County of China across the Amnok River to the northwest. It spans about 10 *ri* east to west and about 20 *ri* north to south, comprising 16 townships (*myŏn*) and 185 villages (*tongni*). The total area is slightly over 109 square *ri*, with 23,655 households (22,578 Korean, 850 Japanese, 227 Chinese) and a population of 132,024 (129,342 Korean, 2,018 Japanese, 664 Chinese).

Briefly setting aside the pre-Koryŏ period, during the Koryŏ Dynasty, it had names like Yongman-hyŏn, Hwaŭi, Poju, or P'oju, later becoming Ŭiju County. Situated on the direct route of communication with China since ancient times, it experienced frequent wars and turmoil due to its relationships, possessing the most historical sites in North P'yŏngan Province. In the 25th year of King Sŏnjo's reign (1592), the position of Ŭiju Prefect (*Puyun*) was established. In the 3rd year of Taishō (1914), the Prefecture (*Pu*) was moved to Sinŭiju, and it became a County (*Kun*), remaining so to this day.

Speaking of the past, it experienced many wars, such as the Koguryŏ campaigns against Sui and Tang, the Koryŏ campaigns against the Khitan, the Imjin War (Japanese invasions), the Pyŏngja Horan (Manchu invasion), the Hong Kyŏng-nae Rebellion in the Sinmi year (1811), the Sino-Japanese War in the Kapo year (1894), and the Russo-Japanese War in the Kapchin year (1904), making Ŭiju a kind of front-line area.

Speaking of the present, as the provincial capital location and border terminus, it is not particularly backward. In terms of education, there are 28 public and private schools with 3,280 students. In terms of religion, Christianity (Protestantism), Ch'ŏndogyo, and Catholicism are very prevalent, with churches everywhere. The land is also not too barren, producing abundant agricultural products. Among them, rice, corn, soybeans, and chestnuts are exported in large quantities to other regions. Other industries are also superior compared to other counties, thanks to its wide area, fertile land, and convenient land and water transportation. However,

The current development rate within the town or in the outer villages shows a sense of backwardness.<80> There are only established businesses based on natural resources; there is no reality centered on human culture. The reason is that just as China received the title of an old, great nation, Ŭiju is also an old, great town. It is generally conservative, decadent, and leans towards leisurely idleness, showing little youthful spirit socially or individually. Furthermore, even the Provincial Office has been relocated to Sinŭiju, causing the town of Ŭiju to face the sad fate of appearing ancient and venerable. The railway goes to Sinŭiju, the Prefectural Office is in Sinŭiju, the Provincial Office is in Sinŭiju, schools are in Sinŭiju, and everything else is concentrated in Sinŭiju. Although Sinŭiju is also part of Ŭiju, Old Ŭiju feels hollowed out, having had its core taken away. Consequently, a sense of lethargy and despair naturally grows among the people. This is an unfortunate situation for Ŭiju. The feeling of an old, great town naturally arises. But is there no way to restore its youthfulness? How about the local people, the masters of that land, rouse themselves once?

Paengma Mountain Fortress and General Im

Paengma Mountain Fortress (白馬山城) is located about 2 *ri* southeast of Ŭiju town, near Paengma Station on the Kyŏngŭi Line. It was built by the Koryŏ Grand Preceptor Kang Kam-ch'an (姜邯贊) for national defense. Later, during the Imjin year (1592) of the Yi Dynasty, Yun Chin-gyŏng (尹進卿) rebuilt it with Im Kyŏng-ŏp (林慶業), the Southern Defense Commander against the Qing. In the Pyŏngja year (1636) of King Injo's reign, when relations with Qing broke down, Im Kyŏng-ŏp, anticipating the imminent disaster of war, focused on defense by guarding Paengma Mountain Fortress with the people of Ŭiju. Unexpectedly, the Qing army advanced in large numbers. Kyŏng-ŏp dispatched envoys to scout the enemy's movements. On the 12th day of the 12th month, the envoys, including Tae-gi (大器), reported using signal fires [聚火?報]. Looking across the river, the enemy's vanguard had already passed Kuryŏnsŏng (九連城). One contingent camped in the southern field, and another in the northern field. Kyŏng-ŏp sent the envoy Kim Mak-tong (金莫同) to the Qing [commander? 淸?] with wine and food as慰問 (comfort), saying, "Although we face each other in battle today, since there is the righteousness of neighboring countries, I express a small token of sincerity." The Qing general initially refused firmly but accepted after repeated requests. He asked, "How much military provision is in the fortress?" The envoy replied, "Enough to last ten years." The Qing general considered it a lie and was about to execute him, but the envoy, unafraid and un[yielding?] [不畏不?], consistently insisted on ten years. The Qing general believed him and asked again, "Is there water in the fortress?" The envoy replied, "There is Yongyŏn (Dragon Pool), and a white horse emerged from it, hence the name Paengma Mountain (White Horse Mountain)." The Qing general then asked, "If there is indeed a pool, what is in it?" The envoy replied, "There are fish." The Qing general said, "If that's true, tell your fortress commander to show me proof that there is a Dragon Pool." The envoy returned and reported everything to Kyŏng-ŏp. Kyŏng-ŏp then sent three live [fish?] [生?], which he had already prepared, arranged on a platter. Seeing the live [fish?], the Qing general was greatly [surprised?] [大?], lifted the siege the same day, withdrew his troops, and never invaded this place again, it is said.

In the 2nd month of the Chŏngch'uk year (1637), the Qing generals Longgūdai (龍骨大) and Yoto Yohu (堯兎堯虎) led over a hundred cavalrymen and went ahead to Shenyang (瀋陽) to report the strange news of the peace treaty. Kyŏng-ŏp, unaware of the events at Namhan Mountain Fortress, intercepted Longgūdai and his group at the north gate of the mountain fortress. Upon hearing about the Namhan Mountain Fortress situation, he wept bitterly and could not stop.

After this, Kyŏng-ŏp made a great resolution, entered the Central Plain (China), achieved great fame as a meritorious subject of three countries [?], but on the day of his return to Korea, he was killed by the traitor Kim Cha-jŏm (金自点).

Eight Strong Men and Seven Righteous Men

The Eight Strong Men (八壯士) refers to Ch'oe Ki-in (崔起仁), Kim Yŏ-ro (金汝老), Chang Sa-min (張士敏), Chang U-gil (張友吉), Paek Sŭng-yun (白勝潤), Kim Chun-ch'ŏl (金俊喆), Han Kyŏng-saeng (韓景生), and Pak Hŭi-bok (朴希福) from Ŭiju. When Princes [Pongnim?] [*林] and [Inp'yŏng?] [*坪], the two Grand Princes, were taken hostage to Shenyang after the Pyŏngja peace treaty, these men gathered in righteousness, formed a bond, accompanied the two Grand Princes, and exerted their utmost efforts [to assist?] [盡力??]. The Seven Righteous Men (七義士) refers to those who entered Qing with the intention of restoring the so-called Great Ming Dynasty and avenging Korea's defeat against Qing: Ch'oe Hyo-il (崔孝一), Ch'a Ye-ryang (車禮亮), An Kŭk-[ch'ŏm?] (安克*), Chang Hu-gŏn (張厚健), Ch'a Chung-ryang (車忠亮), Ch'a Wŏn-ch'ŏl (車元轍), and Ch'a Maeng-yun (車孟胤). Before their plan [could be realized?] [事? 未送], they all met disastrous ends at the South detached palace (南別宮) in Shenyang Fortress.

Sinŭiju Prefecture, Speaking of Youthful Vigor

What was once merely a desolate fishing village has seized the opportunity presented by the Russo-Japanese War, snatching all the essential elements of northern P'yŏngan Province into its embrace. Situated at a vital border point, nestled by the great Amnok River, riding the Korea-Manchuria railway, connected to Ŭiju behind it, embracing Yongamp'o in front, and shaking hands with Andong city on the opposite bank—Sinŭiju Prefecture, boasting that it's the only one that matters on the border, who would dare look down upon it now and in the future? With convenient water and land transport, goods converge; with frequent interaction between the two countries, culture develops.

It already boasts over 4,950 households, reigning supreme in North P'yŏngan, and embraces a population of over 18,000—its capacity for people is grand. It has established Higher Common, Commercial, and Industrial schools—its nurturing of talent is grand. With nearly 30 companies and over 40 factories, its commerce and industry are also grand. Here is its trade table: <82>
[Sinŭiju Trade Table - Note: The table itself is missing from the provided text]

Having achieved such dominance within the province in just about 20 years since its development began, it seems factual that in a few more decades, it could form a major Korean metropolis. In terms of potential for development, perhaps no place in all of Korea surpasses Sinŭiju. I won't elaborate further on the reasons.

Ah—Sinŭiju, speaking of youthful vigor! I wish for it to develop as much as it can. <84>

Sakchu County, Summed Up in a Word

If asked, "What is Sakchu County generally like?" the answer is simply, "Looking at the mountain scenery, there's nothing particularly noteworthy." Ask the officials, ask the people—it's all the same. However, some residents eager to boast about their hometown typically mention these things:

I. Although Sakchu is a mountain county, it produces a lot of rice. About 5,000 *sŏk* annually (less than a single person's harvest in other regions). Also, soybeans are about 8,000 *sŏk* a year, chestnuts 24,000 *sŏk*, corn 7,000 *sŏk*, buckwheat 8,000 *sŏk*. Cotton is not insignificant, at over 57,000 *kŭn*, and hemp is also substantial, producing over 33,000 *kwan*. (Is this grand for a mountain county?)
I. Sakchu is famous for its gold mines. There are 34 mining areas, covering an area of 9.16 million *p'yŏng*. Everyone knows about the famous gold mines on those Sakchu islands. (Currently closed due to financial difficulties).
I. Sakchu's pride is the hot spring (溫井). Go south about 2 *ri* from the town, and you'll find Onjŏng. It's rich in sulfur and iron, instantly effective for infectious diseases and skin ailments.
I. It's also a boast that Sakchu's transportation has become convenient. A second-class road runs from Chŏngju through Kusŏng to Sakchu town, with cars coming and going. Another second-class road comes in from Ŭiju, with cars puffing along daily. For a mountain county, where else could you find such fortune? There's much hope for future development. (Seems plausible).

Is there nothing else noteworthy? Originally, the region is shaped like a long strip, so even transportation within the county seat is very inconvenient. That's why it's divided into Outer Pass (嶺外) and Inner Pass (嶺內). Outer Pass centers around Taegwan Market (大舘市, former county seat) for market trade, while Inner Pass centers around the current county seat...
Education is quite sparse, with only a Public Common School in the county seat and one in Taegwan; otherwise, it's just traditional village schools (*sŏdang*). Ch'ŏndogyo is the most prevalent religion, and there are about 100 Christian households in the county seat.
There are 6 townships (*myŏn*), and the total population within the county is over 6,000 households, with 36,874 people.
As for the location of the county seat? It borders the Amnok River to the northwest, Ch'angsŏng County to the northeast, Kusŏng <85> and T'aech'ŏn to the south, and Ŭiju to the west. It's about 11 *ri* east to west, about 12 *ri* north to south, with an area slightly over 7,004 square [units? 方].
Regarding its history, it was Saknyŏng-hyŏn (朔寧縣, now Taegwan Market) during the Koryŏ Dynasty. During the reign of King Hŏnjong of the Yi Dynasty, it was called Sakchu, and a Defense Commander (*Pangŏsa*) was appointed. In the 12th year of King Sejo's reign, it was moved to the current county seat location, and a County Magistrate (*Kunsu*) was appointed.
Speaking of the March First Movement (己未年 事件)? Sakchu was probably number one. Civilian casualties were over 50. At Taegwan field, thousands gathered for three consecutive days, shouting "Manse!" On the third day, it ended like that due to gunfire from the garrison troops who came from Ch'angsŏng.
That's roughly what Sakchu is like. Who knows what the future holds, but so far, there's nothing special to mention.

Is there a strange story about Sakchu? The saying, "Eat cock and go to Sakchu Taegwan (좃 먹고 朔州 大舘 간다)." What does it mean?
Yes, there is such a saying. Where it originated from, I don't know exactly, but according to one theory, there's a strange rock in the stream in front of Taegwan Market that resembles female genitalia. Whether because of that or something else, it's said that whenever the wives of former local officials came to Taegwan, their "yin" gained force, and they all became promiscuous (亂捧). So the saying isn't "go to Taegwan *after* eating cock," but "go to Taegwan *to* eat cock," supposedly.
Ah, vulgar talk, base talk (常談賤談). (See rest of travelogue for more).

Reed Leaf County, Ch'angsŏng County

It was Changjŏng-hyŏn (長靜縣) in Koryŏ. In the first year of King Tanjong's reign, a fortress was built at Ch'angju (昌州), and a Defense Commander (*Pangŏsa*) was appointed. During King Kongmin's reign, it was called Isŏng (泥城), and a Myriarch (*Manho*) was appointed. During King T'aejong's reign of the Yi Dynasty, the Ch'angju Defense Commander and Isŏng Myriarch posts were abolished, and a Ch'angsŏng County Magistrate (*Kunsu*) was appointed. During King Sejong's reign, it was elevated to a Protectorate General (*Tohobu*), merging with Ch'ŏngsanbang of Unsan. Later, it was changed to Ch'angju *Pyŏngma Ch'ŏmchŏlchesa* (Military Commander). In the Sinmi year (1811?), it was elevated to a Defense Command (*Pangŏyŏng*), controlling the military forces of Ch'angsŏng, Sakchu, Pyŏktong, and 17 garrisons (*chin*). In the Kapsin year (1884?), 10 garrisons were again broken up, the Defense Command was abolished, and it became a county, remaining so to this day.

Geographically, it borders Pyŏktong and Unsan to the east, Sakchu and the Amnok River to the west, and T'aesan and Unsan to the south. The terrain is shaped like an hourglass drum (長鼓形) or a reed leaf (蘆葉形), stretching 5 *ri* east to west and 30 *ri* north to south, making internal county transportation, like Sakchu, very inconvenient. Recently, second-class roads from Ŭiju, Hyesan, and Chin[?] (鎭問?) have entered Ch'angsŏng, providing the convenience of automobiles, and there is also the convenience of Amnok River water transport, so it is not entirely desolate.

There are 8 townships (*myŏn*), an area of 85 square *ri*, 8,000 households, and a population of 41,670.
Education consists of only 3 common schools and 1 private school. Religiously, there are over 650 Christians and over 1,500 Ch'ŏndogyo followers.
Products include the usual rice (around 4,000 *sŏk* annually), millet, soybeans, corn [*玉蜀*], hemp <86>, etc. For livestock, the cattle commonly called "Pyŏkch'ang cattle" (碧昌牛) are famous.

As for historical sites, there is said to be the site of Xue Rengui's (薛仁貴) capital city fortress (都邑城趾) in Taech'ang-myŏn, but this is uncertain. In Ch'ŏngsan-myŏn, there is Tang'a Mountain Fortress (塘峨山城, a natural fortress), which has fine scenery and historical relics. It was a common refuge for the people of old Ch'angsŏng, Sakchu, Ŭiju, and Pyŏktong counties. During the Pyŏngja Horan (1636), it became a route for the Manchu soldiers, and there are monuments to meritorious subjects who died in battle. There are also the Eight Scenic Views (八景: Kunjwasŏk, Aŏb'am, Ponghwangdae, Aeng[mu?]ju [鸚*洲], Yongmun Falls, Sanju Falls, Yŏnggwi Pavilion, Sŏnin Pavilion), making it a renowned place representing the mountain county. Another famous place in Ch'angsŏng is the renowned Taeyudong Gold Mine (大楡洞 金鑛).
(In the 5th year of Kwangmu (1901), the Korean government granted a concession to the Frenchman "P. M. Saltarel" [비엠사일트] for 35 years. They only had to pay 25/100 of the net profit, without mining tax or land tax. With such fools in the government, how could Korea's life and property avoid being ruined?)
And a figure of modern Korean fame,
Kim Ok-kyun (金玉均) is said to have lived in exile in Ch'angsŏng for one year (at Unryong Temple, about 1 *ri* east of the town). (Abridged - See rest of travelogue for more).

A Modest Mountain Town, Pyŏktong County

For a mountain town, commerce is relatively developed in this small mountain county situated amidst the mountains along the Amnok River. Originally Jurchen territory, in the 33rd year of King T'aejong of the Yi Dynasty (1413?), the Isŏng Myriarch Kim Chin (金進) and others drove them out, relocated people from southern Korea, and named it Ŭmtong-hyŏn (陰潼縣). Later, it became Pyŏktong County.

It borders Ch'osan to the east, Ch'angsŏng to the southwest, and the Amnok River to the north. The area is 78 square *ri*, with 8 townships (*myŏn*), over 6,900 households, and a population of over 37,800.
Education, religion, industry, and others are comparable to Ch'angsŏng and Sakchu. Pyŏktong produces abundant iron, and its cattle are famous, earning the name Pyŏkch'ang cattle (碧昌牛).
The spirit of the people is relatively strong, leading to the proverb "Skinning three winter [animals?] and running 30 *ri* (3冬脫皮走 30里)."

Within the county seat, though it sounds like superstition, perhaps because its shape resembles a boat carrying cargo (行舟形), there is no drinking water inside the town, and water has to be brought from far outside the walls. Selling water in a mountain town is an unparalleled oddity. The soil quality is not unsuitable, so the reason remains a question, they say. The saying "One does not drink water from within a boat (舟中水)" has become literally applicable. Namjangdae (南將臺, also called Osahŏn) in the county seat stands tall facing the Amnok River. Directly below it, the Namch'ŏn and Tongch'ŏn streams merge. Okch'ŏn (Jade Spring) below Kubong Mountain has a cold and refreshing taste, making it a famous spot in Pyŏktong, suitable for summer excursions and medicinal effects. The Wind Cave (風穴) directly behind Okch'ŏn generates such cold air even in summer that ice and frost are suspected to form, the local people boast greatly. <87> However,

"Pyŏktong town is not as good as Pyŏktan (碧潼邑不如碧團)," they say. Pyŏktan is a garrison town (*ch'ŏmsajin*) in a wide field located 30 *ri* west of the county seat. Its population exceeds that of the county seat, its commerce is not inferior to the county seat's, and it is famous as a rice-producing area. (Roughly so. See travelogue for more).

Superficially Prosperous, Internally Empty: Ch'osan County

Ch'osan town, the administrative center among the riverside towns, appears like the king of mountain towns from the outside, but looking inside reveals a sense of emptiness. Disembarking at Sinjochang port on the Amnok River and proceeding south for about 1.5 *ri*, one sees the town. Any first-time visitor exclaims, "Ah, Ch'osan town is grand!" But upon entering and seeing it, the somewhat glittering buildings are all government offices; institutions centered around Koreans are practically non-existent. The county office, courthouse, police station, garrison, Chahye Hospital, meteorological station, monopoly bureau—all sorts of government offices have been gathered and placed here. Among Korean civilians, there isn't even a single youth hall or private school. There are only Ch'ŏndogyo and Christian churches. Other counties are also similar, so there's no need to single out Ch'osan.

Ch'osan was originally Isan (理山). A county magistrate兼 agricultural promotion official (*Chigunsa kyŏm Kwannong*) was appointed. In the 30th year of King Sejong of the Yi Dynasty (1448), a County Magistrate (*Kunsu*) was appointed. In the 4th year of King Kyŏngjong (1724), upon the request of Governor O Myŏng-hang (吳命恒), it was promoted to a Protectorate (*Tohobusa*). Later, to avoid King Kyŏngjong's taboo name (諱), Isan was changed to Ch'osan, it is said.

It faces the Amnok River to the north, Wiwŏn and Kanggye to the east and west [error in original? Likely East is Kanggye, West is Wiwon/Pyoktong], and Pyŏktong to the southwest. It spans 33 *ri* east to west and 12 *ri* north to south, with an area of 152 square *ri*, 11 townships (*myŏn*), 10,457 households, and a population of 58,709.
Religion, education, and industry are similar to other counties, with nothing special to note. Ch'osan's famous product, since ancient times, is said to be dog-leather pouches (개 가죽쌈지). Ginseng is also produced abundantly, and beekeeping is not insignificant, but it cannot compare to Kanggye. However, regarding the modern Korean poet
Kim Sakkat (金笠), the claim that he was from Ch'osan was a misreport heard for the first time now. According to townspeople, Kim Sakkat was originally from Tongdo-ri, Kangmyŏn, Ch'osan. Excelling in writing from a young age, he became a disciple of Kim Pyŏng-yŏn (金炳冀) [error: Kim Sakkat's real name was Kim Pyŏng-yŏn] in the capital. Feeling unable to make his way as someone from P'yŏngan Province, he passed himself off as being from the Kim clan of Changdong, Seoul. When Kim Sakkat was in Kyŏngsang Province, his elder brother Kim Yang-baek (金陽伯) visited him, suggesting they travel together to Ch'osan. Sakkat wrote a poem on the wall and ran away. The poem said: "Southward journey, flowers, willows, orioles—third month; Northward return, rivers, mountains, wild geese—one autumn (南征花柳鶯三月 北落江山雁一秋)."

And the Ming general
Li Rusong (李如松)'s ancestor is said to originally be from Ch'osan. According to the town gazetteer, Rusong's grandfather was from Isan County (resided by the Tongno River, now in Wiwŏn's old fortress area, but originally Isan land). Due to committing murder, he and his wife fled to Tieling Guard (鐵嶺衛) and settled there. He first became a company commander (*youji*) through border merits. His son Cheng Yin (成璘, Rusong's father) inherited the post and became a commander (*zhihui*). For merits in attacking [...] mountain, he became a garrison commander (*canjiang*), expanded territory by a thousand *li*, and received enfeoffment and title. When Rusong came to assist <88> Korea during the Imjin War, his father Cheng Yin additionally instructed him, saying, "Korea is my ancestral home; you should strive hard." Rusong once showed his letter [from his father?]. "With family instructions like these, how dare I not exert my utmost for your esteemed country?" he reportedly said. (See other travelogues for more).

Virgin Land by the River: Chasŏng County

Chasŏng was originally subordinate to Kanggye but became independent 55 years ago. Located at the northern tip of Korea, in the northeastern part of P'yŏngan Province, it's a secluded place in the mountains along the Amnok River. Among the nine riverside towns, it ranks second in terms of northernness and mountainousness, so what is there to see? "Only see mountain flowers bloom, and hear the sound of flowing water (只見山花開 且聞水流聲)"—it's such a lonely place. The land is vast and sparsely populated, with much nature and little human artifice; there is no modern-style development whatsoever. It's like an innocent maiden living hidden in the mountains, contentedly laughing when her belly is full from cultivating slash-and-burn fields, happy just to cover her body by making hemp cloth. However,

There is the famous trading post at the mouth of the Chasŏng River, and it also [possesses?] [*엇나니] the famous Chunggangjin, the center of the riverside area. Compared to other counties, it might be superior [優할지언정], certainly not inferior. Although the county seat itself has barely over a hundred households, straddling the Chasŏng River provides the taste of river fish, and natural products like timber, ginseng, and honey are abundant, so there is nothing to envy in terms of clothing, food, and shelter. Only artificial culture seems backward, but roads will eventually be connected, and goods from outside will flow in, so in the not-too-distant future, they will likely build a life enviable by others.

Geographically, it faces the Amnok River to the northwest, Huch'ang County to the east, and Kanggye County to the south. It spans about 13 *ri* east to west and about 17 *ri* north to south, with an area of 117 square *ri*, 7 townships (*myŏn*), and 30 villages (*tong*).
Population-wise, there are over 6,800 households and over 35,400 people.
For schools, there are 3 Public Common Schools and 3 private schools. Religious adherents include 670 Christians and 2,360 Ch'ŏndogyo followers. As for
Agricultural products, soybeans and buckwheat are produced in abundance; soybeans, for instance, are exported at over 7,000 *sŏk* annually. For commercial and handicraft products, straw shoes and hemp shoes are produced in large quantities, earning over 58,000 Won annually. Other activities like sericulture and livestock farming are suitable, making the people's livelihood affluent, it is said. (See rest of travelogue for more).

Growing Stronger with Age: Kanggye County

Kanggye—foreigners might not know, but most Koreans have a general idea of what kind of place it is. A major county in northern P'yŏngan Province, occupying nearly half of P'yŏngan Province, it's a vast region [especially?] [*히] situated on the border, which used to govern the various riverside towns. Known for its magnificent natural setting with imposing mountains and grand rivers (山雄水壯), its scenery is also said to be fine, making it a place that people from the south <89> all wish to visit at least once.

Just as Kanggye was renowned in the past, present-day Kanggye is developed enough to maintain that reputation.
A second-class road runs directly from Sinanju through Hŭich'ŏn, passing Kanggye to Manp'ojin on the Amnok River bank, with automobiles running daily, providing convenient transportation. Located centrally with connections in all directions—Changjin and Huch'ang to the east, Wiwŏn to the west, Hŭich'ŏn and Yŏngwŏn to the south, the Amnok River and Chasŏng to the north—it truly presents the magnificent appearance of a riverside kingdom.

Regarding its history, before Koryŏ, it was Jurchen territory, merely a wasteland. Commonly called "north of the Ch'ŏnggang River is Jurchen land," it was generally avoided. After the Koryŏ dynasty began, the Jurchens were gradually pushed northeastward, and officials (*Wigwan*) were appointed to govern Kanggye, Chasŏng, and Huch'ang. During King Kongmin's reign, the *Wigwan* post was abolished, and a Myriarch (*Manho*) was appointed. In the 18th year of his reign (1369), the four garrisons of Chinbyŏn, Chinsŏng, Chinan, and Chinyŏng were dispatched, commanded by Vice-Myriarchs (*Puch'ŏnho*). During the reign of King T'aejo of the Yi Dynasty, the Myriarch post was abolished, and a *Topyŏngmasa* (Supreme Military Commander) was established. This was again abolished, and it was named Sŏkchu (石州), appointing a *Yŏngjusa* (Provincial Governor). In the 4th year of King Sejong (1422), the *Yŏngjusa* post was abolished, and it became Sŏkchu-pu (石州府), appointing a Prefect兼Professor (*Pusa kyŏm Kyosugwan*). 13 years later (1435?), it was renamed Kanggye-pu (江界府). In the 16th year of King Sejong (1434), a Vice-Magistrate (*P'an'gwan*) was appointed. This was abolished in the first year of King Injo (1623). In the 10th year of King Hyŏnjong (1669), the Professor post was abolished, and the Prefect became full-time. In the 18th year of King Sukchong (1692), a Defense Commander (*Pangŏsa*) was appointed, concurrently holding military command and the Professor role. In the 5th year of King Yŏngjo (1729), the Professor post was abolished, and a *Hyanggyojang* (Director of Local School) was appointed. In the 504th year of the dynasty (1895), the Prefecture (*Pu*) was abolished, and it became a County (*Kun*). In the following year, 505 (1896), an Observation Prefecture (*Kwan-ch'albu*) was established, governing Kanggye, Wiwŏn, Chasŏng, Huch'ang, and Changjin counties. Later that same year, this was abolished, and the area of Kanggye alone became the district, appointing a County Magistrate (*Kunsu*), which continues to this day.

Topographically, high and steep mountain ranges like Chŏgyuryŏng, Kuhyŏllyŏng, and Adŭngnyŏng wind continuously. To the north, the Amnok River flows majestically southward. In the center, the Tongno River flows through. It is truly a grand natural setting with magnificent and beautiful mountains and waters. Spanning about 10 *ri* east to west and about 30 *ri* north to south, with an area of 350 square *ri*, 18 townships (*myŏn*), over 21,200 households, and a population of 18,168 [population seems very low for 21k households - likely a typo in original, maybe 118,168?], it truly possesses a superiority comparable to 4 or 5 counties combined from other regions.

In education, there are 5 Public Common Schools, 2 Public Elementary Schools, and 7 private schools. Religiously, there are over 2,300 Christians and over 2,900 Ch'ŏndogyo followers. Agricultural products include abundant rice, soybeans, barley, millet, sorghum [*蜀*], corn, buckwheat, etc. Special crops like cotton, hemp, sesame, and perilla are produced abundantly and exported. Especially, Kanggye's famous product, mountain ginseng (山蔘), has been renowned since ancient times.

Currently, the county seat has roughly 2,000 households, with considerably developed commerce and industry. There are also 12 or 13 cultural organizations striving for the development of Kanggye and Korea. The Tongno River and Sŏsŏng River flow around the south and west of the town,<90> making water access convenient. It is truly Kanggye County, boasting of its past and present. (See rest of travelogue for more).

Kanggye's Evil Custom: The Hyŏpho System (挾戶制)
In Kanggye, where everything seems plausible, there unfortunately exists a major evil custom. This is something we modern people cannot overlook or forgive: the Hyŏpho system.
So-called *tangja* (當者), those who possess tile-roofed houses or some land (*p'yŏng*), regardless of whether in the town or outer villages, drive poor people to forcibly become servants. In short,
They lend money, 100 or 200 Won, to destitute families without means, interest-free for a certain period. In return, they confiscate that person's rights and obligations. In other words, when poor people face difficulties making a living, they borrow 100 or 200 Won from a capitalist. In exchange, until that money is repaid, the entire family enters that household and sacrifices themselves entirely for all the master's affairs, like slaves. They handle firewood, charcoal, meals, laundry, other public duties, and private chores without pay. This is done in lieu of interest on the 100 or 200 Won. Until the principal is repaid, they become servants for 10 years, 30 years, or even their entire lives. Since the poor lack independent means and have all their rights usurped by the master, the debt gradually increases, and there is no way to repay it. Once entered into the Hyŏpho system, it is akin to lifelong servitude. In cities, it's based on a certain amount of money; in outer villages, it's based on a certain amount of land (*myŏtturak*). Thus, they completely drain the blood and sweat of the poor. This monstrous custom, a great crime against humanity, is an evil practice unique to Kanggye, not found elsewhere. It is said that several concerned individuals are sharpening their iron fists to eradicate it. Will it be easy, given that the power of the capitalists still prevails today? (Just introducing the existence of this evil custom; more in a later installment.)

Clear Waters and Purple Mountains: Hŭich'ŏn County

Hŭich'ŏn is also a mountain town located centrally between Anju and Kanggye. It was Hŭiju (熙州) during the Koryŏ period, later became Ch'ŏngsa-jin (靑瀉鎭). During the Yi Dynasty, after *Ch'ŏmsa* (Commander) Kim Yŏng-ju (金永柱) subjugated the rebellious bandits Tanbong (丹鳳), Arong (啞聾), and Yi Chŏng-sŏng (李正盛), it was promoted to Hŭich'ŏn County for his merit, remaining so to this day.

Bordering Yŏngwŏn and Tŏkch'ŏn to the east, Kaech'ŏn and Anju to the south, Yŏngbyŏn and Unsan to the west, and Kanggye to the north, it lies where the Hŭich'ŏn River flows into the upper reaches of the Ch'ŏngch'ŏn River—a clean county with beautiful mountains and waters for a mountain town.
Speaking of the past, there were bandits like Tanbong and Arong, leading to righteous deeds as well as disturbances, but there are no national historical records. Speaking of the present, it is also a mountain town with inconvenient transportation, so there isn't much development. Straddling the upper Ch'ŏngch'ŏn River and embracing Myohyang Mountain might be Hŭich'ŏn's boast. I turn my pen to the travelogue.

Finally, to the people of Wiwŏn and Huch'ang counties, the reporter sincerely apologizes for his breach of faith and pledges to find an opportunity to visit without fail.<91>

**Summary**

This 1923 travelogue by "Talsŏng" describes a journey through nine administrative districts (1 prefecture, 7 counties, plus Sinŭiju city) along the Korean-Manchurian border (Amnok River). The author contrasts the expectation of a developed, culturally rich border region with the reality of underdevelopment, poverty, and heavy Japanese police/military presence. While noting some historical points, local products (silk, ginseng, cattle), and minor developments (like roads reaching some towns), the dominant theme is the hardship faced by Koreans caught between colonial authorities and independence fighters, especially in areas like Sakchu and Kanggye. Sinŭiju is presented as the exception, a rapidly growing city benefiting from its strategic location and Japanese investment, draining vitality from the older town of Ŭiju. The author expresses sympathy for the suffering population and criticizes oppressive systems like the "Hyŏpho" debt bondage in Kanggye.

For historians, this article offers a valuable ground-level perspective on the conditions in a peripheral region of colonial Korea in the early 1920s. It highlights the stark contrast between colonial development focused on strategic hubs (Sinŭiju) and the neglect of traditional centers (Ŭiju) and rural areas. The pervasive fear induced by the intense policing, the explicit mention of independence army activities, and the description of exploitative social customs like the Hyŏpho system provide insights into the socio-political tensions and economic hardships under Japanese rule. The author's critical tone and selective reporting (acknowledging unspoken truths) also reflect the constraints and sentiments of Korean intellectuals during this period.

一言
江邊 9邑- 義州, 朔州 昌城, 碧潼, 楚山, 渭源, 江界, 慈城, 厚昌-하면 國境으로 보아 江邊으로 보아 모든 것이 그럴 듯하게 發達된 듯 십다. 國境이닛가 兩國由來의 交通上 文化의 交集處가 될 것이니 歷史上 材料가 만흘 것이고 또 有名한 鴨綠江邊이닛가 水運의 便은 그만두고 風景으로만도 擧目할 것이 만흘 것이다. 그러나 事實은 此와 反對로 모든 것이 可觀할 것이 업다. 웨 그러냐 하면 말은 國境이나 事實은 天下에 第一 未開地엿든 南滿 荒蕪地를 對한 것이엿고 北便도 亦 朝鮮의 第一 落後地엿든 西北山地인 까닭이다. 義州를 除하고는 國境이라는 價値가 업는 곳들이니 邑을 奠하기 不過 千年이고 地를 開하기 不過 幾百年이 外라 하니 무엇이 볼 것이 이스랴.
그러닛가 歷史上 아로 보잘 것이 업고 現在의 發達도 또한 볼 것이 업다. 다만 世人의 耳目을 놀내이는 것은 朝鮮獨立軍들의 活動 그것이 近日의 最大 現像이고 所謂 國境 警備이니 不逞鮮人防禦이니 하야 國庫의 力을 傾하야 施設한 警察의 擴張 그것이다.(巡査가 2,300餘 名 警察費가 年 260萬圓 以上) 5里에 警察署 1里에 駐在所 數町에 派出所하야 足을 入하는 到處에 警官의 칼소리요 目을 擧하는 到處에 巡査의 銃날뿐이다.
大槪가 如此하고 보니 모든 文化란 交通不便 土地不利로 發達의 餘望이 아직 업고 人民들은 警官 獨立軍 左右의 間에서 恐怖, 戰慄, 惶㥘에 싸이여 頭를 擡치 못하고 足을 伸치 못하고서 그날 그날을 지내이며＜79＞ 엇던 境遇에는 生命 財産 全家族까지 犧牲을 當하고 마는 일이 만타 한다.
實로 事實은 分明한 事實이나 口不能言 筆不可書의 事實이 만히 잇다. 山不語 水不語 人亦不語의 事實이 만타. 江邊을 본 者- 江邊人士의 當하는 苦痛을 본 者- 木石이 안이거니 누가 소름이 끼치고 가슴이 서늘치 안으랴.
숨은 事實 낫타난 事實 드른대로 본대로 紹介하야스면 조흐련만 압흐로 다른 機會를 두고 이번은 郡과 郡의 現實 狀況 그것뿐 쓰기로 한다.

義州郡은 朝鮮의 西端 中國 滿洲 地方을 對한 國境大邑이다. 東은 朔州, 龜城에 界하고 東南은 龍川, 鐵山, 宣川에 界하고 西北은 鴨綠江을 隔하야 中國 安東 寬甸縣에 對하얏스니 東西가 約 10里 남북이 약 20리 16면 185동리 總面積이 109方里 조곰 넘은데 戶數 23,655戶(內 朝鮮人 22,578戶, 日本人 850戶, 中國人 227戶) 人口 132,024人(內 朝鮮人 129,342人, 日本人 2,018人, 中國人 664人)이다.
高麗 前은 畧하고 高麗 時에는 龍灣縣 又는 和義, 保州, 抱州 等의 稱이 有하다가 後에 義州郡이 되얏다. 古來 中國과 交通直路에 處하야 關係上 屢戰屢亂을 經하야 그- 史蹟이 平北에는 第一 만타. 宣祖 25年에 義州府尹을 置하얏더니 大正 3年에 府는 新義州로 移하고 郡이 되야 今日에 至하얏다.
過去를 말하면 高句麗 對 隋, 唐의 戰役, 高麗 對 契丹의 戰役, 壬辰倭亂, 丙子胡亂, 辛未의 洪景來亂 甲午의 日淸戰役, 甲辰의 日露戰役 等 戰亂이 多하야 義州는 一種 戰線地로 된 狀態를 在하얏고
現在로 말하면 道廳所在地 國境終點인지라 모든 것이 그닥 落後하지는 안이하니 敎育으로 말하면 公私立學校가 28校며 學生이 3,280名이고 宗敎로 말하면 耶蘇敎, 天道敎, 天主敎가 大히 熾성하야 到處에 敎會堂이 잇고 土地로 말해도 그닥 瘠薄하지 안이하야 農産物이 多出하니 그 中米, 玉蜀黍, 大豆, 栗 갓흔 것은 外地의 輸出이 多하며 其他 産業도 他郡에 比하야 優越하니 地廣土沃하고 水陸交通이 便한 까닭이다. 그러나
現在의 그- 邑內 又는 外村의 發展率은 落後의 감이＜80＞ 업지 못하다. 自然力에 依한 固定業 그것 뿐이오 人文을 中心한 무슨 現實이 업다. 그 原因은 中國이 老大國의 稱을 밧음과 갓치 義州도 老大邑인 까닭이다. 大槪가 保守的이고 墮落的이고 閑逸主義인 바 社會的으로 個人的으로 少壯의 氣가 들보인다. 그리고 道廳 그것조차 新義州로 移轉케 된 바 義州邑內는 古色蒼然의 悲運을 當케 되얏다. 鐵道가 新義州, 府廳이 新義州, 道廳이 新義州, 學校가 新義州 其他 모든 것이 新義州에 集中되니 新義州-ㄴ들 義州가 안니랴만은 舊義州는 알속다- 빼앗긴 空虛의 狀態에 陷케 되얏다. 그러니까 人民에게는 自然 惰怠 落望의 感이 늘어간다. 此가 義州를 爲하야 不祥의 事이다. 自然 老大邑의 感이 發한다. 그러나 少壯으로 回復할 道- 업슬가. 그 地의 主人된 一般人士는 한 번 奮起함이 엇덜가 한다.

白馬山城과 林將軍
白馬山城은 義州邑 距 東南 2里許 京義線 白馬驛 附近에 在하니 高麗太師 姜邯贊이 國防의 必要로 築한 바다. 其後 李朝 壬申에 尹進卿이 淸南防禦使 林慶業으로 더부러 개축하얏다. 仁祖 丙子에 淸과 絶和가 되니 林慶業이 兵禍- 將至할 것을 念하야 義州人民으로 더부러 白馬山城을 守하야 防禦에 注力하얏다. 不義에 果然 淸兵이 大擧進出하애 경업이 使를 派하야 敵의 動靜을 探報케 하더니 12月 12日에 使者 大器 등이 聚火*報하얏다. 望見江北則敵의 先鋒이 九連城을 己過하야 一枝軍은 南野에 陣하고 一枝軍은 北野에 陣한지라 慶業이 通使 金莫同을 淸** 遣하야 酒肴로 慰하야 曰 今日雖干伐相對나 旣有隣國之義故로 畧 表徵情이라한대 淸將이 固辭不受러니 請己再三에 受하며 曰 城中軍糧이 幾許오한대 使曰可支十年이라 하니 淸將이 誣言이라하야 斬하리할새 使者- 不畏不*始終如一히 十年을 力說하니 淸將이 信하고 更問曰 城中에 有水乎아한대 使者曰有龍淵而白馬出故로 名白馬山이라 하니 淸將果有淵則淵中有何物乎아 한 대 使曰 有魚也라 하니 淸將曰果然則爾告爾城將하야 示我以有龍淵之證하라한대 使者- 歸하야 具告慶業則 慶業이 己備하얏든 生*3尾로서 盤에 盛하야 送之하니 淸將이 見生*하고 大*각하야 卽日로 解圍而回軍하야 다시는 此地를 不犯하얏다 한다.
丁丑 2月에 淸將 龍骨大以堯兎堯虎로 領百餘騎하고 先往瀋陽하야 傳講和之奇러니 慶業은 南漢山事를 不知하고 龍骨大等의 來을 山城北門에 요격하다가 聞南漢山事하고 痛哭乃己하얏다.
慶業이 此後로 大志를 決하고 中原에 入하야 3國功臣의 偉名을 *하다가 還國하는 日에 奸賊金自点에게 被殺되얏다.

8壯士와 7義士
八壯士는 丙子講和後 王子 *林*坪 二大君이 瀋陽에 볼모로 잡혀갓슬 때 義州의 崔起仁, 金汝老, 張士敏, 張友吉, 白勝潤, 金俊喆, 韓景生, 朴希福 等이 義聚相結하아 2大君을 陪從하야 盡力**하얏다는 그들이고 7義士는 所謂 大明國을 回復하고 淸에 對한 朝鮮의 敗를 雪하자는 意에서 崔孝一
車禮亮, 安克*, 張厚健, 車忠亮, 車元轍
車孟胤 等이 淸에 入하얏다가 事- 未送하고 瀋陽城, 南別宮에서 擧皆 참화를 當한 이들이다.

少壯을 말하는 新義州府
一個 荒落한 漁村에 不過하든 것이 日露戰爭을 機會로 하야 淸北의 모든 骨子를 빼아서 自己의 품에 넛코 國境要樞의 地를 卜하야 鴨綠大江을 끼고 鮮滿大鐵道를 타고 안져서 뒤로 義州와 접하고 압흐로 龍岩浦를 抱하고 對岸 安東市와 握手하야 國境에는 저밧게 업다고 大談하는 新義州府야말로 現在 及 將來에 누가 敢히 壓視치 못하겟다. 水陸이 便하니 物貨가 注集되며 兩國이 頻交하니 人文이 發達된다.
발서 平北에 冠가는 4,950餘 戶를 두고 人口 18,000餘 名을 抱하얏스니 그 容人이 壯하고 高等普通 商工의 學校를 두엇스니 育英이 壯하고 30 近會社 40餘 工場이 잇스니 商工이 또한 壯하다. 玆에 그- 貿易表를 示하면＜82＞
신의주 무역표

開拓된 지 不過 20年內外에 此와 如히 道中 首位의 勢를 占하야스니 압흐로 幾 10年만 지나면 朝鮮的 大都會를 形成할 것도 事實일 듯하다. 發達의 餘地가 限업시 잇는 곳은 朝鮮 全軆로 보아 新義州에 優할 곳은 업슬 것이다. 그- 理由는 더- 말치 안켓다.
아- 少壯을 말하는 新義州 發達될 대로 되기를 祝한다.＜84＞


一言乃盡의 朔州郡
「朔州郡은 都大軆 엇더함닛가」하면 「山色 되다 보닛가 아모 것도 이럿타 할 것이 업슴니다」 하고 그만이다. 官에 問하야도 그것 民에 問하야도 그것 皆- 一樣인데 그나마 自己 고을 자랑하고 십허하는 一部 人士는 大槪 이런 것을 드러 말한다.
一. 朔州가 山邑이지만 쌀이 만히 産出됨니다. 年 5千餘石이 나지오(他地方 1人의 秋收만도 못한 것을) 그리고 大豆가 年 8千餘 石 栗이 2萬 4千餘 石 玉蜀黍가 7千餘 石 喬麥이 8千餘 石 棉도 不少한데 5萬7千餘 斤 大麻도 不少한데 3萬3千餘 貫이나 産出됨니다.(山邑하고 壯할가)
一. 朔州는 金鑛이 有名함니다. 鑛區가 34個所나 되고 鑛區面積이 916萬坪이나 되는데 져- 朔州 셤들 金鑛이라면 누구나 다- 아는 名鑛産이 안임닛가(今에 財政難으로 休鑛)
一. 朔州의 자랑거리는 溫井이지오. 邑에서 南으로 約 2里가랑 가면 溫井인데 琉璜質 鐵分이 만아서 傳染病 瘡疾 갓튼 것은 卽效지요
一. 朔州도 交通이 便利된 것은 자랑거리지요. 定州서 龜城을 經하야 朔州邑까지 2等路가 되야 自働車가 왓다 갓다 하고 義州서도 2等路가 드러와서 自働車가 每日 뿡뿡거리니 山邑치고 에서 더한 幸이 어대 잇겟소. 압흐로는 發達의 希望이 만치요(그럴 듯)
이밧게는 이럿타 할 것이 업슴니가. 原軆- 地方이 길족지 그러하게 되야 邑內 交通도 大不便한 곳이닛가. 그래서 嶺外 嶺內를 갈나 가지고 嶺外는 大舘市(前 邑趾)를 中心하야 市場 賣買 갓튼 것을 하고 嶺內는 現 邑內를 中心하야...
敎育으로 말하면 아조 零星한데 邑內 公普와 大舘 公普가 이슬 뿐이고 其外는 書堂이외다. 宗敎는 天道敎가 第一 만코 邑內에 耶蘇敎가 限 100餘 戶 됨니다.
面은 6面인데 郡內 總人口가 戶數로 6千餘戶 人口가 36,874人이외다.
邑의 位置 말임닛가. 西北은 鴨綠江 東北은 昌城郡 南은＜85＞ 龜城 及 泰川 西는 義州에 界하얏지요. 東西가 約 11里 南北이 約 12里 면적이 7千 4方이 좀 넘슴니다.
沿革이랴야 高麗時代의 朔寧縣(今 大舘市)이든 것이 李朝 憲宗 時에 朔州라 하야 防禦使를 置하얏더니 世祖12년에 현 읍지에 移하고 郡守을 置하얏슴니다.
己未年 事件으로 말임닛가. 아마 朔州가 第一이엿지요. 人民의 死傷이 50餘 名이지요. 大舘 前野에서 連 3日을 數千群衆이 모여서 萬歲를 大呼하다가 第3日만에 昌城으로 來한 守備隊의 銃에 그러케 되얏지오
朔州는 大槪 이럿슴니다. 將來는 엇덜넌지 아직까지는 別로 말슴할 것이 업슴니다 할 뿐이다.
朔州에 對한 怪常스러운 이약이가 잇지 안슴닛가. 「좃 먹고 朔州 大舘 간다」는 말 무슨 말이야요?
네 그런 말이 잇지요. 그- 原因이 어대서 낫는지요. 仔細히 모로나 一說에 依하면 大舘市 前川에 1個 怪岩이 잇는데 女子의 生殖器 비슷하다구요. 그래 그런지 저래 그런지 前 地方官들의 婦女가 大舘만 오면 陰이 勢를 엇어 擧皆 亂捧이 낫다구요. 그래 좃 먹고 大舘간다는 것이 안이라 좃 먹으려고 大舘 간다는 말이라구요.
아- 常談賤談(餘 紀行 參照)

一葦葉州昌城郡
高麗 長靜縣으로 端宗元年에 城을 昌州에 築하고 防禦使를 置하다가 恭愍王 時에 泥城이라 하야 萬戶를 置하고 李朝 太宗 時에 昌州 防禦使 泥城 萬戶를 廢하고 昌城 郡守를 置하얏다가 世宗朝에 陛하야 都護府가 되야 雲山의 靑山防을 合倂하고 後에 改하야 昌州 兵馬僉節制使가 되고 辛未에 陛하야 防禦營이 되야 昌城 朔州碧潼 及 17鐀 兵馬節制를 管轄하더니 甲申에 10鎭을 又 破하고 防禦營을 罷하고 郡으로 하야 今日에 至하얏다.
地勢로 말하면 東은 碧潼及 雲山에 西는 朔州及 鴨綠江에 南은 泰山及 雲山에 界하야 地形이 長鼓形 又는 蘆葉形으로 되야 東西가 5里 南北이 30里에 亘하니 邑內 交通도 朔州와 如히 大不便하다. 近日에 義州 惠山 鎭問二 等이 昌城까지에 入하야 自働車의 便이 잇고 鴨綠江 水運의 便도 有하야 그리 寂寞지 안이하다.
面은 8面 面積은 85方里 戶數는 8千戶 人口는 41,670이 居住한다.
敎育은 普通校 3 私立學校 1個所뿐이고 宗敎는 耶蘇敎人 650餘名 天道敎人이 1500餘名이 된다.
産物은 例의 米(年 4千石 內外) 粟, 大豆, 玉蜀* 大麻＜86＞ 等이고 畜産으로는 俗稱 「碧昌牛」라는 牛- 그것이 有名하다.
古蹟으로 大倉面에 薛仁 貴都邑城趾가 잇다하나 未詳하고 靑山面에 塘峨山城(天然城)이 有하야 景槪조코 古蹟도 有하니 古昌城 朔州 義州 碧潼 4郡民의 共同 避難處엿고 丙子에 胡兵의 進路가 되야 戰死功臣의 碑가 有하다 하며 또 八景(軍座石, 兒負巖, 鳳凰臺, 鸚*洲, 龍門瀑, 散珠瀑, 詠歸亭, 仙人亭)이 有하야 山邑을 代表한 名地라 한다. 또 昌城의 名所로 彼- 有名한 大楡洞 金鑛이 有하다.
(光武 5年에 朝鮮 政府는 35個年 期約으로 佛國人 「비엠사일트」에게 特許하얏다. 鑛稅地稅도 업시 純利益의 100分之25를 納할 뿐으로 그런 바보 자식들이 政府에 잇섯스니 朝鮮의 生命 財産이 쑥밧치 안 되고 말 것이냐」
그리고 朝鮮 近代의 名物兒
金玉均氏가 昌城에 1個年 謫居하얏다 한다. (邑東1里許雲龍寺에서) (畧- 餘紀行 參照)

山中稍當碧潼郡
山邑치고는 商業이 比較的 發達되얏다는 鴨綠江邊 左右 山中에 介在한 山中小邑이다 本來女眞의 地이던 것을 李朝 太宗 33年에 泥城萬戶 金進等이 此를 駈逐하고 南鮮民을 移하야 陰潼縣이라 名하얏더니 後에 碧潼郡이 되얏다.
東은 楚山 西南은 昌城 北은 鴨綠 面積 78方里 8面 6,900餘戶 37,800餘人이 居住한다.
敎育 宗敎 産業其他가 昌朔州와 比等하고 碧潼에는 鐵이 多産하며 牛가 名物이라하야 碧昌牛의 稱을 博하얏다.
人心이 比較的 强하야 3冬脫皮走 30里의 俗言이 잇다.
邑內는 迷信가트나 行舟形이 事實인지 邑內에 飮料水가 無하야 遠히 城外에서 移水할다 山邑에서 水를 賣하게 됨은 類업는 奇事이다. 地質도 不適치는 안은데 何故인지 疑問이라한다. 舟中水는 不飮한다는 말을 꼭 쓰게 되얏다. 邑內의 南將臺(五事軒)는 鴨江을 面하야 兀立하얏는데 直下에는 南川東川이 合流하여 九峯山 下玉泉은 그-味가 冷하고 淸快하야 碧潼의 名所로 夏節遊藥에 適하고 玉泉直後의 風穴은 夏節에도 寒氣大作하야 疑氷結霜이 된다고 仝邑人은 크게 자랑한다. ＜87＞ 그러나
碧潼邑不如碧團이라 하니 碧團음 距邑西 30里에 在한 廣野의 僉使鎭이라 戶口도 邑 以上이요 商事도 邑에 不下하며 米의 産地로 名하다.(畧如此 紀行 參照)

外實內虛의 楚山郡
江邊의 官廳中 心地 楚山邑은 外面으로 보아 山邑 中 王인듯 하나 內面을 窺示하면 空虛의 感이 업지 못하다. 鴨江에서 新鳥場浦口에 下陸하야 約 1里半을 南進하면 邑內가 보이나니 初來者-誰든지 아-楚山邑壯하고 나!하나 及其入見하고 보면 좀번쩍 한 建物은 擧皆官舍이고 朝鮮人 中心의 機關은 업다해도 可하다. 군청, 재판소, 경찰서, 수비대. 慈惠醫院, 測候所, 專賣局等 官廳이란 官廳은 다-가저다 두엇다. 朝鮮民間으로는 靑年會館하나 私立學校하나 업다. 天道敎堂 耶蘇敎堂이 잇슬 뿐이다. 他郡도 亦然하니 何必楚山을 指論할 것은 업다.
楚山은 本來理山이엿다. 知郡司兼 觀農을 置하얏더니 李朝 世宗 30年에 郡守를 置하얏다가 景宗 4年에 監司吳命恒의 請에 陞하야 都護府使가 되얏다가 景宗의 諱를 避하야 理山을 楚山으로 改하얏다 한다.
北은 鴨綠江 東西는 渭原江界 西南은 碧潼에 面하야스리 東西 33里 南北 12里 面積 152方里 11面 10,457戶 58,709人이 居住한다.
宗敎 敎育 産業이 他郡과 如히 別無特記이고 楚山 名物로는 自古로 개가죽쌈지라 한다. 그리고 人蔘이 多産하며 蜜蜂이 不少하나 江界에 比할 수 업고 그런데 朝鮮近代의 詩客
金笠이가 楚山人이라 함은 今始初聞의 誤傳이엿다. 邑人의 設에 依하면 金笠이 本來 楚山江面 東島里人으로 少에 文章大成하야 京城秉炳冀의 門人이 되야 平安道 出身으로 行世不能을 感하고 京城 壯洞 金氏로 行世하얏다 한다. 笠이 在慶尙道時에 其親兄 金陽伯이 往訪하야 同行 楚山云則笠이 一首詩를 壁에 書하고 逸走하니 其詩에 曰「南征花柳鶯三月北落江山雁一秋」.
그리고 明將
李如松의 祖-本來楚山人이라 한다. 邑誌를 據하면 如松祖父木理山郡人 (居禿魯江今在渭原古堡而本則理山之地) 因事殺人 夫妻逃人鐵嶺衛因居焉 乃以邊功始爲遊擊 其子成인(如松父) 承陰爲指揮 以擊盧功險山叅將 拓地千里 得封動爵 及壬辰如松來助 ＜88＞ 朝鮮 父成潔追與盡曰 朝鮮乃 吾先祖鄕汝其勉之如松嘗以其書示之 家敎如此敢不爲貴國盡力平云 (餘他紀行參照

江邊의 處女 地慈城郡
慈城은 本來-江界의 屬地엿다가 分立된지가 距今 55年前이라 朝鮮의 北端 平安道의 東北 鴨綠江 邊山間辟地이라 江邊 9邑에도 北으로 山으로 2位에 處한 곳이니 무엇이 볼것이 잇스랴. 只見山花開 且聞水流聲 그러케 孤寂한 地方이다. 地廣人稀하고 自然多人爲少하니 現代式 發達이란 아모것도 업다. 그저-山間에 隱居하야 自然대로 지나는 天眞스러운 處女갓다. 화전을 경작하야 배부르©´ 웃고 麻布를 제작하야 몸가리우면 조와할 뿐이다. 그러나
有名한 慈城江口의 貿易場이 잇고 또 有名한 中江鎭의 江邊 中心地를 *엇나니 他郡에 比하야 優할지씀¸정 遜色은 업다. 邑內가 비록 百戶에 不過하나 慈城江을 跨하야 川魚의 味가 잇고 또 材木 人蔘 蜂蜜等의 天産品이 豊富하니 衣之 食之 居之에 부러울 것이 업다. 다만 人爲的 文化가 落後된 듯하나 道路가 通할터이요 따라 外地文物이 流入할 터이니 不遠한 將來에 남부럽지 안을 살님을 할 것이다.
地勢로 말하면 西北은 鴨綠江 東은 厚昌郡 南은 江界郡에 面하야 東西 約 13里 南北 約 17里 面積 117方里 7面 30洞이고
人口로 戶數 6,800餘戶 人口 35,400餘人이다.
學校는 公普가 3校 私立 3校이고 宗敎信者는 耶蘇敎가 670人 天道敎가 2,360人이다. 그리고
農作物로는 大豆 蕎麥이 多産되야 大豆 가튼 것은 年 7,000餘石을 輸出시키고 商工品으로 草鞋麻鞋가 多産하야 年58,000餘圓를 得하며 其他 養蠶畜産에 適하야 人民의 生活이 豊饒하다한다. (餘紀行參照)

老益壯의 江界郡
江界- 하면 外國人은 모르지만 朝鮮人은 거긔가 엇더한 地方인지 大槪 다- 斟酌한다. 平安道北의 巨郡 卽 平安道의 半部를 占하얏다는 廣大한 地方으로 *히 國境에 處하야 江邊諸邑으로 統御하든 곳이다. 山雄水壯의 天然大局으로 物色이 또한 조타 하야 南方의＜89＞ 人은 누구나 한번 보기를 願하는 地方이다.
過去의 江界도 朝鮮의 名色이엿지만 現의 江界도 그 聲名을 그대로 保持하리만치 發達되야 잇다.
新安州로부터 熙川을 徑하야 江界를 通하야 鴨江邊滿浦鎭까지 2等路가 直通하야 每日 自働車가 通行하니 交通의 便이 有하고 東으로 長津及厚昌 西으로 渭原 南으로 熙川及 寧遠 北으로 鴨江及慈城 4通5達의 中央에 處하야 實로 江邊王國의 偉觀을 呈하고 잇다.
沿革으로 말하면 高麗以前은 女眞의 地로 一荒蕪地에 不過하야 俗所謂淸江以北은 靺鞨之地 라 하야 一般人이 忌避하든 처이러니 高麗朝 以後 漸次 女眞을 東北으로 駈逐하고 委官을 置 하야 江界慈城厚昌을 관할케 하다가 恭愍時에 倭官을 폐하야 萬戶를 置하고 仝 18年에 鎭邊 鎭成 鎭安 鎭寧의 4軍을 派하야 副千戶로써 此를 統轄케 하얏다가 李朝 太祖朝에 至하야 萬戶를 廢하고 都兵馬使를 設하고 다시 此를 廢하고 石州라 하야 領州事를 置하얏더니 世宗 4년에 州事를 폐하고 石州府오 하야 府使兼 敎授官을 置하고 後 13年에 江界府로 改하고 世宗16年에 判官을 置하얏더니 仁祖 元年에 廢하고 顯宗10年에 敎授官을 廢하고 府使가 專任하고 肅宗18年에 防禦使를 置하야 兵備及 敎授官을 兼하고 英宗5年에 敎授官을 廢하고 鄕校長을 置하고 開國504年에 府를 廢하고 郡이 되고 翌505年에 觀察府를 置하고 江界 渭原 慈城 厚昌 長津 各 郡을 管轄하다가 同年에 此를 廢하고 江界 1圓을 區域으로 하야 郡守를 置하야 今日에 至하얏다.
地勢는 狄踰嶺 狗峴嶺 牙得嶺 高山峻嶺이 蜿蜒히 相連하고 北에는 鴨綠江이 洋洋히 南流하고 中央은 禿魯江이 貫流하야 實로 山水가 壯益秀한 大自然의 大局이다. 東西가 約10里 南北이 約30里 面積 350方里 面이 18面 戶數가 2만 1천 2백餘戶 人口가 18,168人 實로 他地方 4, 5個郡을 合한 것 만한 優勢를 가지고 잇다.
敎育으로는 公立普通이 5校 公立小學校가 2校 私立學校 7個所이며 宗敎로는 耶蘇敎 2,300餘 名 天道敎 2900餘 人이 되고 農産으로는 米, 大豆, 大麥, 粟, 蜀*, 玉蜀*, 蕎麥 等이 多産하며 特用作物로는 棉, 大麻, 胡麻, 荏이 多産하야 外地에 輸出을 하며 特히 江界 名産 山蔘은 自古로 有名하다.
現在 邑內는 畧2千戶나 되는데 商工業이 꽤 發達되얏고 文化를 中心한 團體도 12, 3團體가 有하야 江界及 朝鮮의 發展에 盡力하며 禿魯江 西城江이 邑의 南及西으로＜90＞ 回流하니 水利도 便하야 實로 過去 자랑를 하며 現在를 자랑하는 江界郡이다.(餘紀行文 參照)
江界의 惡風挾戶制 모든 것이 그럴듯한 江界에 不幸히 1大惡風이 有하니 이야말로 現代의 吾人으로서는 黙過치 못하고 容恕치 못할 일이니 卽 挾戶制이다.
所謂 當者라 하야 瓦家問이나 쓰고 土地坪이 잇는 者들은 邑內 外村을 母論하고 貧民을 駈하야 奴僕을 强作하는 짓이니 卽 말하자면
無依無家한 貧民에게 金錢을 100圓 或 200圓을 相當한 其間에 無利로 貸與하고 其代로 其人의 權利及 義務를 沒領한다. 다시 말하면 貧民이 生計가 難한 時는 資本者에게 100圓 或 200圓을 借用하고 其代로 其金을 還償하기까지는 全家族이 其家에 沒入하야 奴僕式으로 主人의 온갓 살림에 全體를 犧牲한다. 柴炭 食事 洗濯 其他 公役及 私役無償으로 全擔한다. 100圓 或 200圓에 對한 利子代로 그리하야 그- 本錢을 還償하기까지는 10年이고 30年이고 平生을 두고 奴僕이 되고 만다. 貧者로서 自由業이 업고 全權利를 主人에게 被奪하얏스니 債務는 漸高하고 還價은 無路하야 一次 挾戶에 入하면 終身役과 一般이다. 城市에는 金錢 幾許로, 外村에는 土地幾斗落으로 그러케 貧者의 血汗을 吸盡하고 만다. 이런 人類로의 大罪惡的怪風은 他地에 업는 江界 特有의 惡風이다. 此를 掃盡키 爲하야 幾個有志가 鐵拳를 磿鍊하고 잇다 하다. 資本主의 勢가 依然得勢한 今日이라 容易할넌지? (惡風잇다는 그것뿐 紹介하고 後期를 두고 아직만다.)

山紫水明의 熙川郡
熙川은 安州와 江界의 中央에 處한 亦是 山邑이다. 高麗時의 熙州로서 後에 靑瀉鎭이 되얏다가 李朝時 僉使 金永柱가 殘賊 丹鳳, 啞聾, 李正盛의 作亂을 討平한 功으로 陞하야 熙川郡이 되야 今日에 至하얏다.
東으로 寧遠德川 南으로 价川安州 西으로 寧邊雲山 北으로 江界를 面하야 淸川江 上流 熙川江回盡處 卽 山邑하고는 山水가 俱麗한 깨끗한 고을이다.
過去로 말하면 丹鳳이니 啞聾 殘賊이 有하야 義蹟도 有하고 撓亂도 有하얏스나 國家的史蹟은 업고 現在로 말하면 亦 交通이 不便한 山邑이닛가 別로 發達된 것이 업다. 淸川江上流의 跨하야 妙香山을 抱한 그것이 熙川의 자랑이라 할는지 筆을 紀行으로 轉하고 만다.
最後에 渭原 厚昌 兩郡 人士에게 記者의 失信을 伏謝하며 期於코 期會어뎌 차자 뵈옵기로 自誓한다.＜91＞
