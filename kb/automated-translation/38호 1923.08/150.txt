Crossing the Amnok River Railway Bridge
May 19th (Sat) Clear. For a visitor to Sinŭiju, the most urgent things are sightseeing the Amnok River Railway Bridge, the Andong city streets, and the Wŏnbo and Chin'gang riverside parks. As usual, our party, pressed for time regarding our main destination, departed early towards Andong.
The so-called greatest railway bridge in the East, the Amnok River Railway Bridge: the center is for trains, the east and west sides are pedestrian walkways, and it opens and closes three times a day. This railway bridge is indeed a great Eastern structure whose fame is not undeserved. Its form is magnificent, and its structure is robust. Completed in Meiji 44 (1911) after starting construction in Meiji 35 (1902) with 12 spans, 3,098 feet long, at a cost of 1.75 million Yen, this railway bridge is the gateway to Manchuria, the endpoint of Korea, directly connecting East Asia and Europe; its location and fame are truly worth boasting about to the world.
On the north and south banks of the river stand the two great border cities, Andong and Sinŭiju, and to the west and east of the river, plains stretch wide open. With water and land transportation, the concentration of culture, and the flourishing trade of goods, it is a strategically important and prosperous center in every aspect.
Ah, the vast and boundless 2,000-ri long river! When did it begin, and when will it end? How many people has it sustained, and how many has it killed? How many tens of thousands of tons of goods has it sent out, and how many has it received?
How many millions of logs has it carried, and how many tens of millions of sŏk of grain has it transported? Those ships floating ceaselessly up and down the river, without a break—are they for life or for death? It is so immense that my thoughts cannot find a thread.
Enough, Amnok River! Though you are clearly a Korean river, why do you only receive the tears and resentment of the Korean people? Who would not find the waves of the Amnok refreshing, yet the Koreans who possess you grieve. Who would not find the wind on the Nok River cool, yet the Koreans who possess you feel sorrow. Enough, Nok River! Who praises the moon over the Nok River, and who delights in the sun over the Nok River? The spring waves of the Nok River, the summer surges of the Nok River, the autumn moon of the Nok River, the winter snow of the Nok River—none of these bring even a speck of comfort to the Korean people. The brothers entering the country <54> invariably sigh and bow their heads as they enter, and the compatriots leaving the country habitually shed tears and hide their faces as they depart. What is this about? Whose fault is it? It cannot be your fault. Though I know clearly it is not your fault, my heart is so heavy with oppression that I ask you.

Standing exposed in the middle of the railway bridge, looking up, down, left, and right, trying to unravel the tangled resentment and grievances seems endless and without limit. Those ahead shout "Hurry up!" and those behind urge "Let's go!", so I was inevitably pushed along and reached the end of the railway bridge. Though the guards and customs officers stand armed with rifles, their eyes peeled, what concern is it of mine? Boldly, I crossed the border.
From here, it's foreign land. Foreign land? Why must it be called foreign? It's just a world where people live. A border? What is a border, after all?
However, the language is different, the clothes are different, the customs are different, so the impression of a different country and different people is unavoidable. Just seeing the sign 「小心火車」 (Be careful of trains; Xiǎoxīn huǒchē) gives a definite sense of having come to a foreign country. This must be the habit of perception, right?

A Glimpse of Andong City Streets
We briefly stopped by the Japanese Consulate in Andong County, met Vice-Consul Kim U-yŏng, and heard about the general situation in Andong. Then, we visited Yujŏngho, a trading company managed by Koreans, met the managers Kim Ch'ang and
Chang Ki-sik, and heard about the business situation of Koreans in Andong and the circumstances of Korean compatriots residing in South Manchuria. Afterward, we enjoyed a delicious lunch provided by Mr. Kim U-yŏng at a Chinese restaurant. That uninvited female entertainers spontaneously came to pour drinks—should this be called a good custom? It is a strange practice not found in Korea.
Now, there was nothing left but to see the city streets. Ah, it was nauseatingly filthy. Refuse, mud, winding paths, uneven ground, add to that narrowness, stench, and dust—one had to cover the nose <55> and shield the eyes, what a commotion. However, the buildings were sturdy and grand. The roadside eateries were truly dirty. Flies and dust covered not just the food but even the shopkeepers, making them almost invisible—what more can be said? Why did the police look so incompetent? Dressed in gray uniforms, arms folded, looking like scarecrows who haven't eaten in three days, standing rigidly like totem poles—they were helpless scarecrows.
Enough! Let's go see Wŏnbo Mountain. We hailed one of China's two-horse carriages—famous for being dirty, numerous, cheap, and bumpy—agreeing on a fare of 20 chŏn to Wŏnbo Mountain, and went to Wŏnbo Mountain Park. At the foot of the mountain, there is a Guan Miao (關廟 - Temple to Guan Yu), a school, and a place of amusement. Though not tidy and neat, Wŏnbo Mountain is the main mountain of Andong, a public park for the Chinese citizens. As the mountain is high and located to the north, ascending it affords a view not only of the entire Andong area but also, behind, a circle of South Manchuria, and ahead, the opposite Korean shore, all laid out beneath one's eyes. White clouds scatter over Kŭmsŏk Mountain, and boats and rafts come and go on the Amnok River. To the west, the dotted Hyŏngje Mountain and the vast expanse of the long river; to the east, Wihwa Island, Nanja Island, and even T'onggun Pavilion faintly visible in the distance. Bending down to look at the streets of Andong—ah, how complex it is. Bang, bang, clang, clang—all sorts of miscellaneous noises arise. My ears ache and my eyes are dazzled. Though people strive so in search of life, it feels as if death is imminent. The line by Sŏsan Taesa, "The capitals of myriad nations are like anthills, the heroes of a thousand autumns like vinegar flies" (萬國都城如蟻蛭 千秋豪傑似醯鷄), suddenly comes to mind.
It seems a fact that anyone who climbs a mountain or approaches water tends to view the world as mundane dust and explore and appreciate nature. There is a pavilion, and on its east and west pillars hangs a poetic couplet: 「人在畵圖中 江流天地外」 (People are within a painting, the river flows beyond heaven and earth) – someone aptly expressed this wonder. I too might have poetic thoughts, but amidst the impatient and dissenting members of our group, I just let it pass.
We were not the type to linger long in one place. "Let's move quickly, let's go back," they urged, so we descended the mountain and settled into accommodation at the Haedong Inn on Andong's 3-bŏn T'ong street. We stayed up late engaged in earnest conversation with visiting Korean brothers; perhaps because it was a foreign country, it felt especially affectionate and welcoming.
May 20th (Sunday) Clear. Seeing only Wŏnbo Mountain and not Chin'gang Mountain would also be narrow-minded. "Let's see everything evenly," we decided, and climbed Chin'gang Mountain. It was indeed in the typical Japanese style. A park decorated neatly and prettily like a beautiful woman, truly a point of pride for the Manchurian gateway. Whether one dislikes it or admires it, the work of the Japanese undeniably holds the top position in the East. Comparing the Chinese city streets with the Japanese city streets revealed perhaps a hundred-year difference; comparing the Chinese park on Wŏnbo Mountain with the Japanese park on Chin'gang Mountain showed at least a ten-year difference. Their facilities were meticulously <56> crafted. Regarding this matter and that, like an old man without children, my feelings were unnecessarily wounded, and sighing, I soon turned away.

T'onggun Pavilion, Full of Regret and Emotion
May 22nd (Tuesday) Clear. A day ahead of Messrs. Cho, Yi, and Han, I came to Ŭiju by car with Mr. Hong U-ryong. We took lodging at the T'aehŭng Inn, run by Ms. Yi Yŏng-suk, famous for her female calligraphy, and immediately visited T'onggun Pavilion.
T'onggun Pavilion! A famous landmark of the border region, the pride of Ŭiju, one of the Eight Sights of the Western Province (Sŏdo P'algyŏng). T'onggun Pavilion, full of emotion, full of regret, and also full of events! I have longed for you for a long time. It is my shame to see you only now, being within this province. Having only heard your name and not seen you, I was curious; now I shall gaze my fill. T'onggun Pavilion, welcome me warmly. In the many hundreds of years since you were built, how eventful has your existence been, how much trouble have you seen? Sitting loftily aloof on the banks of the turbulent Amnok River, by the eventful border, how many hundreds, how many thousands of times have you witnessed people coming and going, hated people and loved people, unpleasant matters and pleasant ones, dangerous affairs and easy ones?
Those so-called envoy processions (使臣行次), imperial envoy processions (勅使行次)—how clamorous they must have been! Those coming and going surely rested in your embrace before continuing. Those so-called magistrates (使徒令監), county governors (郡守나으리)—those coming and going surely sought you out, disturbing you clamorously. So-called poets and scholars (詩人墨客), so-called talented men and beautiful women (才子美人), so-called riffraff (挾雜亂類)—over the long years and countless days, how many times a day did you have to endure them?

Those who shed tears in your embrace must number in the unknown thousands; those who laughed heartily in your embrace also number in the unknown thousands; those who clung to you and died number in the unknown thousands; and those who fell ill because of you must also number in the unknown thousands. Ah, T'onggun Pavilion, so full of emotion, so full of regret, so full of events!
The Amnok River flows on as before, Kŭmgang Mountain stands verdant as before, and you too <57> stand loftily aloof as before—but where have those people of yesteryear gone? I too shall follow in their footsteps. Ah, what a place of deep feelings! Ah, what a place of heartache!
During the Imjin War (1592) and the Pyŏngja Invasion (1636), how many rifle shots did you hear? During the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars, how many cannon sounds did you hear? Bullet holes are still visible on the pillars, and the cannon emplacement sites remain below as before; I can tell you have endured all sorts of life-and-death tempests.
Standing gracefully atop T'onggun Pavilion, my emotions are boundless. Recalling the past and contemplating the present, the only feeling that arises is heartache. Thinking of that sordid history of so-called fraternal nations (兄弟之國) and greater and lesser states (大小之國), and facing this nauseating current situation of so-called borders (國境) and strategic points (要塞), I feel, like T'onggun Pavilion, full of regret and resentment.
Put it away. What use is lamenting the past? Wipe it clean. What difference does resenting the present make? Let us only look forward to the future with a smile.
Evening smoke drifts over Ŏch'ŏk Island, and white clouds rise over Ma'i Mountain. Green willows grace Nanja Island; fertile fields mark Wihwa Island; a solitary old pine stands at Kuryong Pavilion—this is the scenery below T'onggun Pavilion. To the west, Sinŭiju and Andong County lie like a dinner table below one's chin; to the south, Paengma Mountain Fortress stands as an outer guard; to the east, Kŭmgang Mountain Temple rings its evening bell; and to the north, the great expanse of Manchuria unfolds tiredly. The ten-thousand-ri long river flows beneath my feet, and the city of a thousand households lies before my eyes. It seems the most superb view under heaven might be T'onggun Pavilion alone.
"A long wall faces the vast, flowing water; dotted mountains rise east of the great plain" (長城一面溶溶水 大野東頭點點山) rivals P'yŏngyang but is even more apt for T'onggun Pavilion. "Two streams divide the white heron isle" (二水中分白鷺洲) doesn't even compare; here, the Amnok River islands are divided by two, three, or even four streams. Fishing boats float on the Ch'ŏngma Channel, merchant ships on the Amnok River. White egrets fly sideways across the river in flocks, and fishermen slowly pull in their nets.
A true man seeing this would shout once; a poet seeing this would compose a verse; an ink painter seeing this would sketch it once; a drinker seeing this would have a cup.
I was intoxicated by T'onggun Pavilion and completely unaware that the sun had set and the moon was about to rise. Only when Mr. Hong said, "It's getting dark, how about returning to the inn?" did I realize I had stayed too long. As I prepared to turn back, promising a later return, I felt reluctant to leave, as if parting from a lover or losing a treasure; my feet simply wouldn't turn back. Moreover, thinking of the plight of T'onggun Pavilion—having lost the direct continental route to Sinŭiju, and now about to lose even the provincial office to Sinŭiju, standing lonely and aloof, feeling the past and grieving the future, full of emotion and regret—a tear of sympathy spontaneously flowed.
Back at the inn, dinner was served. After eating my fill, both body and mind were content. Who spoke of the hardships of travel? The host was kind, and <58> the food was agreeable; I declared I would be a long-term guest.
After staying for 2-3 days, attending to necessary matters and completing tasks, I returned to Sinŭiju, parted ways with Cho and Yi, and set off on the long journey to Kanggye. (See separate page for details on Ŭiju and Sinŭiju).

From Sinŭiju to Hŭich'ŏn
May 28th (Monday) Clear. At 7:00 AM, I took the Pusan-bound direct train to Sinanju, then transferred to the Kaech'ŏn-bound light railway, arriving at Kunu-ri, famous for its iron mine, at 1:00 PM that afternoon. After waiting about 2 hours, I boarded the Hŭich'ŏn-bound automobile at 3:00 PM.
Here, I must say one thing in advance. Anyone who has not traveled by automobile from Sinanju to Kanggye should not even claim to have traveled. I declare emphatically that the most superb scenery in the world is here, and the greatest thrill of a lifetime lies in this single journey. Following the Ch'ŏngch'ŏn River, whose name alone makes one's spirit leap, the road climbs up between towering cliffs and long, deep valleys. Passing through the town of Hŭich'ŏn, noted for its beautiful mountains and clear waters, and crossing Kugu Pass, the boundary between Hŭich'ŏn and Kanggye, it then descends along Kanggye's famous Tongno River, also following a marvelous and spectacular mountain path and stone track for several hundred ri. Truly, the automobile journey from Anju to Kanggye is where one encounters all sorts of scenes—tingling, startling, and also thrilling and refreshing—enough to make one's testicles tingle and bladder burst.
As the automobile carrying me began rolling along the 400-ri second-class road, there was a clear breeze ahead and a cloud of dust behind. About 1 ri out of Kunu-ri, we reached the Ch'ŏngch'ŏn River. Green mountains to the right, blue water to the left; the automobile speeding between them, chugging along—the passenger inside felt as if heading to an immortal's realm or seeking paradise. Even passersby watched helplessly with envy, and I myself almost died from excessive joy.
Passing through Pukwŏn Street, we came to Mokp'an-i, where the boundary marker between Ch'ŏngnam and Ch'ŏngbuk was visible. Passing Kujang Market in Nyŏngbyŏn, a famous large town on the An'gang Road, we entered the region where it's truly "mountains high, valleys deep, only the sound of flowing water is heard." Cross a stream, and there's another stream; cross a mountain, and there's another mountain; round a slope, and there's another slope; pass a cliff, and there's another cliff. It was truly enough to make one's liver shrink and bladder burst. If anything went slightly wrong, the car and its occupants would instantly become powder in the thousand-fathom abyss, the ten-thousand-fathom black pool below—how could one's heart not pound?
But it was exhilarating! The Ch'ŏngch'ŏn River is indeed the Ch'ŏngch'ŏn River (Clear Stream River). How could the water be so clear and blue like a duck's egg, and how could the sand and pebbles be so white and clean like silver nuggets? Seeing it once refreshed the spirit; seeing it twice invigorated the body. Should I look at the fantastic rocks, the strange stones, the deep pools, or the rushing rapids? Yellow birds singing on branches, fish heads emerging from the river—I couldn't decide what to look at. If only I had about ten ears <59> and a hundred eyes at such times—that would be good.
Passing Sinhŭng Street, we arrived at Wŏllim and stopped briefly. Wŏllim is the famous large village at the entrance to Myohyang Mountain. Hyangsan (Fragrant Mountain) rose right before our eyes, and the famous Pohyŏn Temple was said to be only 1 ri away.
I hadn't realized Hyangsan was right beside the An'gang road. Having bought my ticket to Hŭich'ŏn, what could I do? If I had followed my heart, I would have visited Hyangsan first, regardless of Hŭich'ŏn or Kanggye—but bound by my ticket, I reluctantly sighed again and again, passing Hyangsan by, and reached Hŭich'ŏn that day.
Hŭich'ŏn town is a clean and charming place with fine mountains and good water. Whether the people are also like that is questionable, but it is nonetheless a famous town among the mountains. Guided by Kim Chong-hyŏp, a fellow member of the Ch'ŏndogyo faith in Hŭich'ŏn, I took lodging at the Ilchin Inn, immediately took a look around the town, returned to the inn, and spent the whole night enjoying conversation with Messrs. Kim Chong-hyŏp,
Yi Chong-hun,
Kang Sŏng-sam,
and Na Sa-hun. (At that time in Hŭich'ŏn, an incident involving the illegal logging of sandalwood trees (檀木) had occurred, and almost all the town's prominent figures were caught in the legal net and sent far away to Ŭiju, leaving the town seemingly empty as if swept clean.)
The next day, the 29th, was also clear. Accompanied by Messrs. Kim, Yi, and Na, I toured Hŭich'ŏn Park, the old fortress ruins, Yŏnmu Pavilion, and Ch'ilsŏng Peak. We fished for silver scales in the Hŭich'ŏn River, enjoyed Hŭich'ŏn with a few cups of fragrant wine, and relieved the feelings of a traveler. As if to let me taste even Hŭich'ŏn's rain, the heavens bestowed a few drops of sweet rain. Since it did so, that too seemed fitting.
No matter how I thought about it, I couldn't live without seeing Hyangsan, a lifelong aspiration. Although it was originally on Mr. Cho's party's itinerary, I had no choice but to usurp it. Ah well, let me usurp it, ready to face accusations from Mr. Cho.
I decided to go to Hyangsan. At dawn the next day, the 30th, with simple luggage, accompanied by Mr. Yi Chong-hun, I set out on foot for the 50-ri journey to Hyangsan.

Myohyang Mountain, Famous Scenery of Kwansŏ
Myohyang Mountain, the famous scenic spot of Kwansŏ (West of the Passes, i.e., northwestern Korea), is known as the birthplace of Tangun, the divine founder of the Korean nation; one of Korea's Eight Great Famous Mountains; possessing the three names T'aebaek, Myohyang, and Ami (Emei); situated where the two great rivers, Taedong and Ch'ŏngch'ŏn, flow flanking it; forming the boundary of some 10 counties including Nyŏngbyŏn, Tŏkch'ŏn, Hŭich'ŏn, and Kaech'ŏn; the birthplace of King Kŭmwa of Koguryŏ; and the place where the famous monks Sŏsan and Samyŏng practiced austerity. Its fame for scenic beauty and historical sites is preeminent in the world, a fact well-known to all. Sŏsan Taesa (Hyujŏng) evaluated the four mountains thus: Kŭmgang (Diamond) is beautiful but not majestic (秀而不壯), Chiri is majestic but not beautiful (壯而不秀), Kuwŏl is neither majestic nor beautiful (不壯不秀), while Myohyang is both majestic and beautiful (亦壯亦秀), thus elevating Hyangsan as the foremost in Korea. To see such a majestic and beautiful Myohyang Mountain—when would the opportunity come? It is something desired even by children and common folk. <60>
To be able to see such a Hyangsan in this way made my steps and spirit leap with joy. Meeting the Hyangsan monk (a student studying in Japan) Kim Sŭng-bŏp by chance midway and becoming companions was an even more fortunate encounter. After deliciously eating a bowl of cold noodles each at Wŏllim, crossing the Wŏllim River, and meeting Messrs. Yi Kyŏng-hun and
Pae Chin-yŏng at Old Wŏllim, from then on, the five of us journeyed together to Hyangsan.
Treading upon and drinking from the white stones and clear streams at the entrance to Hyangsan valley, strolling leisurely along the mountain path in the evening sun, chatting with every step, smoking every ten steps, saying repeatedly "It's just at the entrance of this valley, the valley is deep, its extent unknown," resting briefly at Simjin Pavilion, crossing the Outer Lion's Neck pass and turning into the Inner Lion's Neck pass—there, amidst the densely flourishing trees, stood a great temple complex laid out neatly. This was Pohyŏn Temple, the main temple of Hyangsan and one of Korea's Five Great Temples.
Wandering in the courtyard, glancing at the mountain scenery and water colors, taking a few steps to appreciate the entire temple view, I entered the guest room, shed my travel clothes, washed my feet in the clear stream, and lay down relaxed on a clean seat, instantly forgetting the hardships of the journey, feeling content in body and mind. Just then, the courtyard became noisy as a group of students entered. Wondering which school they were from, I went out onto the veranda; it was a group of 20 students from P'yŏngyang Kwangsŏng Higher Common School on a study trip. Meeting students in the mountains feels like meeting old friends—how delightful it was! Among them, appropriately, was Mun Hak-sŏn, a graduate of this year from my alma mater, Kyŏngsŏng Posŏng Higher Common School. It was even more delightful. Soon, mountain delicacies and wild fragrances comforted my hungry stomach, leaving no other desires. I asked Mr. Kim Sŭng-bŏp about the history of the temple and the overall scenery of the mountain. As I was about to lie down, a rather peculiar fellow came visiting; at first glance, he looked like some sort of policeman. "Where did you come from?" "Yes, I came from Seoul." "Why did you come from Seoul?" "For sightseeing. Why do you ask?" "No, well, I need to report the guest." His words were so ignorant and unpleasant that I just chuckled and let it pass.
However, in such a grand temple, why were no monks visible? Only about ten laborers and several strong men busy with meals were seen; as for monks, whether they had all fled or were hiding, they were nowhere to be seen. The sounds of sutra chanting and bells were completely absent. The head monk, Pak Po-bong, perhaps because he was reserved or perhaps because he slept a lot, far from seeking out visitors, even when I asked to see him, the message conveyed was "He is asleep," and I was told to see him tomorrow. My mood soured.
Pohyŏn Temple originally began with the founding of Ansim Temple by Master T'ammil from Yonghŭng County in the 19th year of King Kwangjong, the 4th monarch of Koryŏ (over 900 years ago). Later, in the 3rd year of King Kyŏngjong, the 5th monarch of Koryŏ, it was founded by Master Honggwak, T'ammil's chief disciple (actually his son). (At the time of founding, it is said to have housed 24 halls and educated 3,000 monks). Subsequently, it underwent repeated decay and reconstruction, continuing through a total of 6 major rebuildings to reach its present state. Until just over 10 years ago, the temple was quite prosperous, had many monks, and even ran a school. But after the Ŭlmyo year flood 9 years ago (1915), when mountains collapsed, the temple was ruined, over 100 private houses were washed away, <61> and several hundred people were injured, its fortunes seem to have declined, leading to the current desolate state. Seeing the scarcity of trees on the mountain, the abundance of landslides, the absence of houses at the valley entrance, and the accumulation of tumbled rocks, one can well imagine the tragic state at that time. The temple's assets are said to include ownership of the entire Hyangsan area, approximately 70,000 chŏngbo (about 171,500 acres), and annual harvest income of about 10,000 Won. It is not that poor a temple. No, it is said to be a wealthy temple, ranking 6th among the 30 head temples. Why isn't this wealth invested in some public benefit enterprise? Is it miserliness? No, it is reported that there are signs of intention to invest in public benefit projects. That is welcome news. The fact that there are 7 or 8 students studying abroad is even more commendable.
May 31st (Thursday) Clear. Early rising and early breakfast are the custom in temples. No matter how worldly a guest or how tired one is, there's no alternative. After breakfast, I sought out the head monk, Mr. Pak Po-bong, for a conversation, and also met the teachers from Kwangsŏng School, Messrs. Yun Chong-sik
and Kang Pyŏng-gŏn, exchanging greetings and comfort.
Guided by Mr. Kim Sŭng-bŏp, I set out sightseeing with the Kwangsŏng group. We saw the entirety of Pohyŏn Temple. We toured the Chogye Gate, the Stele commemorating Sŏsan Taesa's deeds (Inscription omitted, refer to *Pulgyo T'ongsa* - Comprehensive History of Buddhism), Haet'al Gate (Gate of Liberation), Ch'ŏnwang Gate (Gate of the Heavenly Kings), Manse Pavilion (Pavilion of Ten Thousand Years), Taeung Hall (Main Buddha Hall), Myŏngbu Hall (Hall of Judgment), Kŭngnak Hall (Hall of Paradise - containing portraits and relics of the three great masters Sŏsan, Samyŏng, and Noemuk), Such'ung Shrine (祠 - Sŏsan Academy, bestowed by the Yi Dynasty), and other various temple buildings.

Unusual Traces and Anecdotes of Hyangsan
One name for Myohyang is Pangjang (方丈; Kim I-gyo's poem says: "It was anciently called the overseas mountain possessing Pangjang"). Another name is Ami (峨媚; Emei); another is T'aebaek (太白; "The white cliffs like snow, hence T'aebaek." Also said: "It surpasses the sky, having the air of Li Qinglian [Li Bai]." Sŏsan said: "The realm of Mount Emei is just like silver; looking at it is like seeing the heroic spirit of Li Taibai [Li Bai]"). Another name is Myohyang (妙香; "The mountain has many fragrant trees, green even in winter, hence when Master T'ammil founded the temple, he named it Myohyang." Also said: "Its excellence warns the world like the writings of Bai Letian [Bai Juyi]." Hence Hyangsan. Master Sŏllyŏng's poem says: "The mountain is at the source of the Ch'ŏngch'ŏn River, majestically coiled in the west, touching the gates of heaven. After the yellow leaves fall from a thousand forests, the fragrant trees leave green traces in the snow. Myohyang spreads its name like the writings of Bai Xiangshan [Bai Juyi]"). Whether mountains, waters, people, or things, nothing seems complete without imitating China. Even Myohyang Mountain has been poisoned by China. Our ancestors were indeed disgustingly loyal servants to China.

I. Tangun's Deeds
The *Kogi* (古記 - Old Record) says: "Long ago, the Heavenly God Hwanin ordered his illegitimate son Ung to take the three Heavenly Seals (天符三印) and lead 3,000 followers to descend beneath a sandalwood tree (檀木) on Mount T'aebaek. This place was called Sinsi (神市 - Divine City). He ruled over 300 matters. Here, a bear constantly prayed to the god, wishing to become human. The god fashioned mugwort (艾) into two bundles and twenty cloves of garlic (蒜), saying, 'Eat this and do not see sunlight, and you will attain human form.' The bear ate it and in seven days obtained the form of a woman. Seeing her wish for pregnancy, the god temporarily transformed into a man, married her, and she conceived, giving birth to a son. This was Tangun."
The *T'aebaek Haeng* (太白行 - Journey to T'aebaek) says: "Thinking back to the distant time when the bear transformed, it was precisely when the people of the East established their nation." On the South Cliff of Hyangno Peak (Incense Burner Peak) there is a ** [text missing/illegible] four chang high, five elbow-lengths north-south, three elbow-lengths east-west, naturally forming an iron hall (東肘逆出玉泉 - from the east elbow flows Jade Spring). An ancient sandalwood tree ** [text missing/illegible] stands upon it. It is traditionally said to be Tangun's birthplace, now called Tŭngch'ŏn Cave (登天窟 - Heaven-Ascending Cave, named because Hwanung ascended to heaven from here). About ten ri south of it is Tangun** [text missing/illegible], traditionally said to be Tangun's martial training ground. Below it is a cave, also called Tangun Cave. North of it is Tangun** [text missing/illegible], ** [text missing/illegible] staff, ** [text missing/illegible] inner **, ** [text missing/illegible] bowl. Tangun Hermitage, Hyangjŏk Hermitage. North is Sŏng Hermitage (聖庵), built for Hwanin, Hwanung, and Tangun. <62>
This is excerpted from the *Record of Deeds at Pohyŏn Temple*. To save space, I omit the interpretation. This alone is enough to understand the contemporary accounts of Tangun's birth.

I. The Story of Haemosu, Son of the Heavenly Emperor
Tradition says: "The Son of the Heavenly Emperor, Haemosu, descended in the land of Puyŏ, riding a dragon chariot, accompanied by over a hundred attendants. He stopped at T'aesim Mountain (now Hyangsan's Sŏnyu Peak - Peak of Immortal Play). In the morning, he attended to affairs; in the evening, he ascended to heaven. The world called him Heavenly King. He saw Yuhwa, daughter of the River God (河伯), playing outside. He drew a line on the ground with a * [text missing/illegible], and a room materialized. He set out wine and arranged seating. The River God's servant sent a messenger asking, 'Who are you, detaining my queen?' He replied, 'I am the Son of the Heavenly Emperor and wish to marry her.' He then rode with the woman in the dragon chariot to his palace. The River God welcomed him, saying, 'You are the Son of the Heavenly Emperor, what divine powers do you possess?' The King replied, 'Test me as you wish.' Thereupon, the River God transformed into a Kun fish (鯤); the King immediately transformed into an otter (瀨). The River God was amazed, treated him as a son-in-law, and the marriage was formalized. The King, fearing the River God had no intention of letting him keep the woman, intended to ascend to heaven with her while he was heavily drunk. Before they emerged from the water, the River God awoke and said to his daughter, 'You disobeyed my instructions, left without permission, and shamed our family.' He banished her and exiled her to the * [text missing/illegible]bal River (*渤水)."
This too is introduced as a reference, and I will abbreviate it.

I. The Story of King Kŭmwa
King Puru of Puyŏ had no son. He performed rites to the mountains and rivers, praying for an heir. When he reached Kŏnnyŏn Pond (鯤淵; now Kŭmjang-dong, P'ungch'ŏn-myŏn), the horse he rode saw a large stone and shed tears facing it. The king found this strange and ordered the stone moved. There was a small child, golden like a frog (金蛙). The king rejoiced, "Is this not Heaven * [text missing/illegible] granting me an heir?" He took him in and raised him, naming him Kŭmwa (Golden Frog).

I. The Story of King Chumong
King Kŭmwa of Puyŏ found Yuhwa at the * [text missing/illegible]bal River and confined her in a room. She was illuminated by the sun; she moved to avoid it, but the sunlight followed and shone on her. Consequently, she conceived and laid a large egg. Even when cloudy, light remained on the egg. He tried to break it open but couldn't. He abandoned it on the road, but horses and cattle avoided treading on it. He discarded it, but birds covered and protected it with their wings. * [text missing/illegible] returned it to its mother, who placed it in a warm place. A male child broke out of the shell; his crying voice was extremely loud, his bones and appearance heroic and strange. He was named Chumong (朱蒙), who became King Tongmyŏng.

To write down all the unusual traces and legends would take too much space and be rambling. There is also the story of the founding of the capital of the Haengin people (荇人國), the theory of the 80,000 realms of Myohyang's Dharma world (妙香法界), the legend of the Toksŏng (獨聖 - Solitary Saint, one of the 500 Arhats) revealing himself on Yusŏl Peak (由雪峯), the tale of Wŏnhyo throwing a tray (元曉擲盤), and since it is a temple full of superstition and legends, there are all sorts of strange and bizarre tales. I will just close my eyes and cut them off. Among them, I might have introduced some stories about Sŏsan and Samyŏng—but there is no need for that either. It is enough to know just this: Sŏsan Taesa's original name was Hyŏnŭng (玄應), his Dharma name was Hyujŏng (休靜), and his style name was Ch'ŏnghŏ (淸虛); he was from the Wansan Ch'oe clan, whose ancestors were exiled to Anju; he was a high monk of Buddhism who resided regularly at Hyangsan; during the Imjin War, he gathered several thousand soldiers and fought against the Japanese troops with his disciples Ŭiŏm (義嚴), Samyŏng (惟政 - Yujŏng), and Noemuk (雷黙 - Ch'ŏyŏng); he served both Buddhism and the state as the National Preceptor and Supreme Head of Meditation and Doctrine (國一都大禪師 禪敎都總攝); and he passed away at Hyangsan at the age of 85. The verse he left at his passing, 「80年前渠是我 80年後我是渠」("80 years ago, he was me; 80 years later, I am he"), seems to hold some deep meaning. <63>
Our party finished viewing the Pohyŏn Temple area and now headed for Sangwŏn Hermitage, a famous scenic spot of Hyangsan. The plan for the day was to go to Sangwŏn Hermitage, visit Tangun Terrace, and return to Pohyŏn, so we had to move quickly. Each holding a sturdy short staff, we started climbing the mountain with shouts of "Heave ho!" Keeping pace with the energetic and enthusiastic troop of middle school students gave us a hundred times more vigor. Grasping trees, kicking aside rocks, crossing streams, climbing mountains, we finally reached the refreshing Chungnyŏng Pass summit.
Looking up, the mountains rose layer upon layer; the highest peak is called Pŏbwang Peak (Dharma King Peak). Looking down, the water was deep and rippling, but its name is apparently still unknown. A flock of crows flies over T'ammil Peak, and white clouds swirl around the middle level of Kŏm Peak (Sword Peak). Pŏbwang Peak is so high, it evokes the feeling of "A stone rolled down for a thousand years wouldn't reach the bottom; a hand stretched out a foot could touch the sky" (石轉千年不到底 手長一尺可摩天). They say "There are homes deep among the white clouds" (白雲深處有人家), but finding farm fields in such a high, secluded mountain spot is truly rare. An old farming couple leisurely hoed their field; the mountains and water were natural, the old farmers were natural—it didn't seem like the human world. Climbing gradually higher, we indeed saw a small thatched hut. Seeking it out, we announced the arrival of worldly guests. Two old women were grinding soybeans with a millstone to make tofu. Asked if there was a memorial service, they said the tofu was to be taken to Sangwŏn Hermitage. Asked how they could live there, being scared, they replied that the mountain spirit helps them. Asked if they were trying to educate their sons and daughters, they just said "Hunger is the enemy." Still, they raised pigs, calves, and chickens.
"Let's go again, hurry," they urged, and climbing layer upon layer, we were told we were near Sangwŏn Hermitage. There was a steep cliff with an iron chain about 10 chang (approx. 30 meters) long dangling down. It is said that here, anyone with sins must confess them as they are before climbing; otherwise, they will fall and die. The story goes that the P'yŏngyang rake Kim Pong-i Sŏndal coaxed women into sightseeing at Hyangsan, listened to their confessions here, made copies, and managed to get fine clothes and padded socks—this story originated here. Indeed, it is steep and frightening enough to deceive women and children. Passing the iron chain and climbing up, we arrived at what is truly the foremost scene of Hyangsan, nay, a view unparalleled even in the Kŭmgang Mountains—the Inhodae (Tiger Platform) in front of Sangwŏn Hermitage. Never mind the distant view; let's just describe the immediate scene right before our eyes and beneath our feet. Shall I write it in prose? Draw it as a picture? Describe it in words? Both writing and speech fail. One can only smack one's lips, saying, "Well, well... oh my... oh my..."

**Summary**

The author, Ch'unp'a, describes a journey starting from crossing the Yalu River from Sinŭiju into Andong, Manchuria, in May 1923. He observes the contrast between the Chinese and Japanese sections of Andong, expressing disdain for the former's squalor and grudging admiration for the latter's efficiency. He then travels back into Korea to Ŭiju, reflects emotionally on the historical significance and decline of T'onggun Pavilion, and proceeds via train and automobile through scenic, rugged mountain terrain along the Ch'ŏngch'ŏn River towards Hŭich'ŏn. Finally, driven by a long-held desire, he diverts from his planned route to trek into Myohyang Mountain, visiting the historically significant but somewhat neglected Pohyŏn Temple, recounting local legends (Tangun, Haemosu, Kŭmwa, Chumong), and beginning the ascent towards Sangwŏn Hermitage before the article abruptly ends.

From a colonial history perspective, the article is interesting for its raw portrayal of Korean sentiment at the border: the feeling of sorrow crossing the Yalu, the critical comparison between Chinese and Japanese colonial presence/development in Andong, and the lament for the diminished status of historic Korean sites like T'onggun Pavilion. The author's complex feelings—national pride mixed with observations of decay and foreign influence (even criticizing ancient Korean emulation of China), and his emotional connection to the landscape and history—provide insight into the psyche of an educated Korean intellectual during the Japanese occupation. The mention of Korean businesses, interactions with Japanese officials, and the state of Buddhist institutions like Pohyŏn Temple also offer valuable social details of the era.

鴨江 鐵橋를 건녀면서
5月 19日 (土) 晴 신의주 來客으로 第一 急한 것은 鴨江 鐵橋 求景. 安東 市街 求景 元寶鎭江 兩公園 求景이다. 依例로 본거지만 一時가 急한 우리 一行은 安東을 向하야 일즉이 떠낫다.
所謂 東洋 第一의 大鐵橋 鴨綠江 鐵橋 中央은 汽車橋 東西는 往來 人道橋 日 3時 開閉橋. 이 鐵橋야말로 名不虛傳의 東洋 大建物이다. 形式도 宏壯하거니와 構造도 健固하다. 12間 3,098呎 工費 175萬圓으로 (明治 35年에 起工하야 44年에 竣成) 된 이 鐵橋는 滿洲의 관문 朝鮮의 終點 東亞 歐洲 직통으로 그 位置 그 名聲이 果然 世界에 소리처 자랑할 만하다
江北 江南에 安東 新義州 兩 國境 大都會가 잇고 江西 江東에 平野가 通開하얏스니 水陸交通 人文의 集註物貨의 段盛. 엇던 方面으로든지 雄州巨塞이다.
아- 洋洋勢無窮한 2千里 長江? 언으때 始하야스며 언으때 終하랴는가. 사람을 얼마나 살녀스며 또 얼마나 죽엿는가. 物貨는 멧 萬噸이나 보내스며 또 밧앗는가.
材木은 幾百萬株를 안어내스며 穀物 幾千萬石을 실어내엿는가. 上下에 뵌 틈 업시 無時로 떠잇난 저- 船舶 生을 爲함이냐 死를 爲함이냐. 하도 浩蕩하니 生覺이 頭緖를 못 가리겟다.
아서라 鴨綠江아 네가 分明히 朝鮮의 江이여늘 왜 朝鮮人의 눈물과 怨恨만 밧어드리느냐. 鴨江의 波를 누가 快하다 안이하랴만은 너를 둔 朝鮮人은 悲한다. 綠江의 風을 누가 시원타 안이하랴만은 너를 둔 朝鮮人은 늣기는구나. 아서라 綠江아 綠江의 月을 讚美하는 者 누구며 綠江의 日을 翫賞하는 者- 누구냐. 綠上의 春波 綠江의 夏濤 綠江의 秋月 綠江의 冬雪 그것이다- 朝鮮人에게는 一點의 慰安이 못 되는구나. 國內로 드러오는＜54＞ 兄弟- 반듯이 한숨 지우며 머리 숙이고 드러오고 國外로 나아가는 同胞- 依例로 눈물 뿌리며 얼굴 가리우고 나아가니 웬일이냐 탓이 누 탓이냐? 아무래도 네 탓이지 안이다. 너야 무슨 罪랴 分明히 녜 罪가 안일 줄 알면서도 하도 抑鬱하야 너에게 뭇는다.

鐵橋 中央에 벗치고 서서 上下左右를 내미러 보고 올녀미러 보면서 두루 엉크러진 抑怨을 풀자 하니 限이 업고 끗이 업다. 압선 자- 어서 오라 뒤선 者- 어서 가자 하니 不得已 밀니여 鐵橋 終點을 발게 되얏다. 守兵 稅官이 비록 銃뿌리를 두르고 눈이 빠지게 注目을 한들 於我에 何關고 坦坦然 國境을 넘어섯다.
여기부터 外國땅이로구나 外國? 何必 外國이랄 것 무엇이냐. 그저- 사람 사는 世界이지 國境? 國境이 다- 무엇이냐.
그러나 말이 다르고 衣服이 다르고 風俗이 다르니 異國 異民族의 觀이 업지 못하다. 牌木에 「小心火車」의 句만 보아도 外國來의 感이 確實히 잇다. 이것도 習慣眼이겟지?

安東 市街를 一瞥하면서
安東縣 日本領事舘에 暫間 들녀 副領事 金雨英氏를 차자 安東의 槪况을 듯고 다시 朝鮮人 經營의 商會 裕政號에 들녀 主務 金昶
張驥植 兩氏를 차자 安東에 對한 朝鮮人의 商况 及 南滿在留의 朝鮮同胞의 狀况을 듯고 나서 엇던 中國 料理店에서 金雨英氏의 주는 點心을 맛잇게 먹엇다. 不請妓가 自進하야 巡盃酌은 善俗이라 할넌지 朝鮮에 업는 奇風이다.
이제부터는 市街를 좀 볼 밧게 업섯다. 아- 口逆이 나리만콤 醜雜하다. 塵芥 泥梁 曲折 凹凸 게다가 挾窄 냄새나고 몬지나니 코 막고＜55＞눈 가리우고 야단니겟다. 그러나 建物들은 堅固雄壯하다. 路傍 飮食店은 참- 더럽기도 하다. 파리와 몬지가 食物은 말고 店人까지 뒤싸서 보이지 안이하니 더- 할 말이 무엇이랴. 警官이란 왜 그리 無能해 보일가. 灰色 服裝에 팔장 끼고 3日 1食도 못한 사람가티 장승 모양으로 우둑허니 선 것은 할 수 업는 허수압이다.
에라. 元寶山이나 求景하자. 彼- 더럽기로 有名하고 數 만키로 有名하고 갑싸기로 有名하고 들추기로 有名한 中國의 2頭馬車를 元寶山까지 20錢 約定으로 불너 타고 元寶山 公園에를 갓다. 山下에 關廟가 잇고 學校가 잇고 遊樂處가 잇다. 整齊하고 산듯하지는 못하나 그러나 元寶山은 安東의 主山이라 中國 市民의 共同公園이다. 山이 高하고 位가 北이닛가 此 山에만 登하면 安東 全景은 姑捨하고 뒤로 南滿洲 一圓 압흐로 朝鮮 對岸이 統히 눈 아레 든다. 金石山에 白雲이 飛散하고 鴨綠江에 舟筏이 往來한다. 西으로 點點한 兄弟山 또 溶溶한 長江 大勢와 東으로 威化島 蘭子島 멀니 統軍亭까지 稀微히 보인다. 허리를 굽혀 安東 行街를 보니 아- 複雜도 하다. 꽝 꽝 퉁탕 別에 別 雜소리가 만히 난다. 귀가 압흐고 눈이 부시다. 生을 찾노라 그리 하겟지만 死가 方今 臨한 듯 하다. 西山이 이른바 「萬國都城如蟻蛭千秋豪傑似醯鷄」의 句가 문득 生覺난다.
누구나 山에 登하고 水에 臨하면 世上을 濛塵視하고 自然을 探賞來함이 事實인 것 갓다. 亭子 잇고 亭子 東西柱에 一首의 句가 부터스니 「人在畵圖中江流天地外」란 누가 그럴 듯이 白驚을 날니엿다. 나 또한 詩想이 업스랴만은 急進派 反對派의 틈에서 그만 이렁저렁하고 마랏다.
一處 長留客은 우리갓지 안터라. 빨니 단니자 도라 가자 하야 下山하야 安東 3番通 海東旅舘에 宿所를 定하엿다. 訪來한 兄弟들과 懇談으로 繼夜하니 그나마 外國이라 그런지 別로 情답고 반가웟다.
20日 (日曜) 晴. 元寶山만 보고 鎭江山을 안이 보면 그도 偏狹하다 남으라지 골고루 보아주자하야 鎭江山에 登하니 그야말로 例의 日本式이다. 말숙하고 산듯하게 美人式으로 꿈여논 公園 實로 滿洲關口의 자랑거리이다. 밉던지 곱던지 日本人의 하는 일이야말로 東洋에서는 首位를 안이 許할 수 업다. 中國 市街를 보고 日本 市街를 볼 때 過하게 百年差를 부티게 되더니 元寶山 中國公園을 보고 鎭江山 日本公園을 보니 少하야도 10年 差는 되야 보인다. 그들의 施設이야말로 곰실곰실하게도＜56＞하얏다. 此事 彼事에 子息 업는 老人 모양으로 空然히 心情만 傷해저서 한숨 지으며 곳 도라서고 마럿다.

多恨多情한 統軍亭
22日 (火曜) 晴. 趙 李 韓 諸氏보다 1日을 先하야 洪宇龍씨와 가티 自働車로 義州에 來하얏다. 女子 名筆로 有名한 李英淑氏의 泰興旅舘에 宿所를 定하고 卽時로 統軍亭부터 訪問하얏다.
統軍亭! 國境의 一名物 義州의 자랑거리 西道八景의 一. 多情하고 多恨하고 亦 多事한 統軍亭! 내 너를 그리운지 오래엿다. 本道內에서 이제야 보게 됨은 나의 수치이다. 일홈만 듯고 보지 못하야 궁금하드니 이제는 슬컷 보리라. 統軍亭아 반가히 마져다고. 생긴지 멧 百年에 얼마나 多事하야스며 얼마나 多煩하얏는가. 多事한 國境 風波 만흔 鴨江邊에 兀然히 놉피 안자 가는 사람 오는 사람 미운 사람 고은 사람 실은 일 조흔 일 險한 일 쉬운 일을 멧 百 番이나 츠려스며 멧 千 番이나 격것는가.
彼- 所謂 使臣 行次 勅使 行次 얼마나 식그러웟는가. 오는 자 가는 자 반듯이 네 품에 드러 쉬고 가섯지. 彼- 所謂 使徒令監 郡守나으리 오는 자 가는 자 반듯이 너를 차자 식그럽게 귀엿지. 所謂 詩人墨客 所謂 才子美人 所謂 挾雜亂類 長長歲月 多多日時에 하루에 멧 번 式이나 츠렷는가.

너의 품에서 눈물 뿌린 者도 不知幾 千名이고 너의 품에서 우슴 우슨 者도 不知幾 千名이고 너를 껴안고 죽은 者도 不知幾 千名이고 너로 하야 病든 者도 不知幾 千名이겟지. 아- 多情코 多恨코 多事한 統軍亭아.
鴨江은 如前히 흘너잇고 金剛은 如前히 푸르러 잇고 너조차＜57＞ 如前히 兀然히 놉하 잇는데 그때의 그 사람들은 어대로 갓드란 말가. 나조차 그- 뒤를 밟을 터이지 아- 多感處로다. 아- 傷心處로다.
壬辰 丙子에 銃 소리는 얼마나 드러스며 日淸 日露에 大砲 소리는 얼마나 드럿는가. 銃알자리 기둥에 完然하고 大砲자리터 밋헤 如前하니 죽을 번 살 번 別別 風波를 다- 격근 너일 줄을 알겟다.
統軍亭 上에 飄然히 올나선 나는 感慨가 無量하다. 過去를 追憶하고 現在를 생각하니 오직 생기는 것은 傷心 그것뿐이다. 所謂 兄弟之國이니 大小之國이니 하야 그때의 그 더러운 歷史를 생각하고 所謂 國境이니 要塞이니 하야 現在의 이 신물 도는 情况을 當하고보니 統軍亭과 갓치 恨도 만코 怨도 만타.
집어치워라. 過去를 恨한들 무엇하며 씨처 버려라. 現在를 怨한들 別數가 잇느냐. 오직 將來뿐만은 우서보자.
於赤島에 夕烟이 들고 馬耳山에 白雲이 이러난다. 楊柳靑靑 蘭子島 沃土井井 威化島 老松孤立 九龍堂- 이것이다- 統軍亭 下의 景인데 西으로 新義州 安東縣이 턱 아래 밥상 갓고 南으로 白馬山城이 外衛를 하고 東으로 金剛山寺가 暮鐘을 울니고 北으로 滿洲 大幅이 倦來하는데 萬里長江이 발 아래로 흐르고 千戶市街가 눈 아레 노여스니 天下의 絶景은 統軍º­뿐일가 한다.
「長城一面溶溶水 大野東頭點點山」은 平壤에 敵하나 統軍亭에 더욱 近하다. 「2水中分白驚洲」는 말도 말고 2水3分 3水4分의 鴨江 列島이다. 淸馬廊江에는 魚船이 뜨고 鴨綠江에는 商船이 떳는데 白驚는 片片橫江去하고 漁翁은 徐徐히 그물을 것는다.
丈夫가 보매 한 번 소리칠 것이며 詩人이 보매 한 번 읍흘 것이며 墨客이 보매 한번 그릴 것이며 酒客이 보매 한잔 마실 것이다.
나는 統軍亭에 醉하야 日己盡月將出을 도무지 몰나섯다. 洪氏의 「日暮하니 歸舘이 若何오」 하는 말에 비로소 넘우 오랫슴을 깨닷고 後期를 두고 도라셔랴 하니 님을 여이는 듯 寶物을 일은 듯 섭섭하고 끄을니고 하야 발길이 참아 안이 도라선다. 더구나 大陸直通路를 新義州에 빼앗기고 道廳까지 新義州에 빼앗기게 되야 孤寂히 兀然히 셔서 過去를 늣기며 將來를 悲傷하는 多情多恨의 統軍亭 身勢를 생각하매 一種 同情의 淚가 스르르 흐른다.
旅舘에 來하니 저녁이 드러온다. 배불니 먹고나니 心身이 俱足하다. 누가 客苦를 말하드냐. 主人이 親切하고＜58＞飮食이 適口하니 長爲客을 宣言하얏다.
2, 3日 留하면서 볼일을 보고 할 일을 다- 한 뒤에 다시 新義州에 와서 趙 李와 手를 分하야 멀니 江界行을 作하얏다. (義州 新義州 記事 別頁 參照)

新義州서 熙川까지
5月 28日 (月曜) 晴. 午前 7時 釜山 直行을 타고 新安州에 來하야 다시 价川行 輕便車를 換乘하고 同午后 1時 鐵鑛으로 有名한 軍隅里에 着하얏다. 約 2時間이나 기다려서 仝3時에 熙川行 自働車를 탓다.
여기서 미리 한 마듸 말해 둘 것이 잇다. 누구든지 新安州서 江界까지 自働車 旅行을 못해본 者는 旅行하얏노라고 말도 말나는 말이다. 天下의 絶景은 여기에 잇고 平生의 痛快는 此一擧에 잇다고 大히 宣言해둔다. 말만 드러도 精神이 펄닥나는 淸川江을 끼고 層嚴絶壁 長山大谷 사이로 來來 올나간다. 그리하야 山紫水明의 熙川邑을 지내서 熙川 江界 分界인 狗峴嶺을 넘어서는 다시 江界 名江 禿魯江을 끼고 亦是 奇絶壯絶한 山路石徑 數百里를 내려간다. 참말 불알이 재리고 오줌이 나오리만한 자릿자릿하고 깜즉깜즉하고 그리고 痛快하고 시원한 別에 別 光景을 다- 當하게 되는 곳은 이 安州 至 江界의 自働車行이다.
自働車가 이 몸을 싯고 400里 2等路에 구을기 始作하니 압흐로 淸風이요 뒤로 塵煙이다. 軍隅里에서 約 1里許를 나셔니 바로 淸川江이다. 右靑山 左綠水 그 사이로 뿡뿡거려 다라나는 自働車 안이 그 안에 안즌 손은 仙臺를 가는 듯 天堂을 찾는 듯 行人도 束手하야 羨望하지만 余 自身도 넘어 조와 죽을 번 하얏다.
北院 巨里를 지나 木藩이를 오니 淸南 淸北 分界標가 보인다. 安江路 中의 名巨里 寧邊의 球場市를 지나니 이제부터는 正말 山高谷深只聞水流聲이란 그곳이 다 물을 건너면 또 물 山을 넘으면 또 山 비탈을 돌면 또 비탈 絶壁을 지나면 또 絶壁 實로 肝이 마르고 오좀통이 터질 만하다. 닷틋하면 車고 사람이고 왼퉁 斷崖千尺 萬丈黑沼 中에 콩가루가 되고 말 터이니 엇지 가슴이 안이 조이랴.
그러나 快하다. 淸川江은 果然 淸川江이다. 물은 엇지 그리 오리빗 갓치 맑고 푸르며 沙石은 엇지 그리 銀떵이 가치 희고 깨긋한지 한 번 보매 精神이 爽快하고 두 번 보매 肉身이 湧躍된다. 奇岩을 볼가 怪石을 볼가 深淵을 볼가 殘灘을 볼가 枝上黃鳥啼 江上魚頭出 엇던 것을 볼넌지 頭緖를 못 차리겟다. 이런 때 귀가 열쯤＜59＞ 잇고 눈이 百쯤 되야스면- 됴켓다.
新興 巨里를 지내 月林에 오니 暫間 停車한다. 月林은 妙香山 入口의 名巨里이다. 香山이 바로 눈압헤 소삿는데 有名한 普賢寺가 1里밧게 안이된다 한다.
香山이 바로 安江 路邊인 줄은 分明히 몰나섯다. 車票를 熙川까지 사스니 엇지 하랴. 마음 갓태스면 熙川이고 江界고 爲先 香山부터 訪問하야스면― 하얏지만 車票에 拘束되야 不得已 嗟嘆又嗟嘆하면서 香山을 엽헤 두고 이 날은 熙川까지 왓다.
山 조코 물 조코 깨긋하고 정답게 생긴 고을은 熙川邑이다. 사람들도 그런지는 疑問이나 如何間 山中名邑이다. 熙川 敎友 金宗浹氏 案內로 一進旅舘에 宿所를 定하고 卽時로 市街를 一瞥하고 回舘하야 盡夜록토 金宗浹
李嵕塤
康成三
羅賜壎 諸氏로 談樂하얏다. (當時의 熙川에는 檀木 盜伐 事件이 起하야 邑內 人士란 擧皆 法網에 걸니여 멀니 義州行을 하고 邑內가 씨츤 듯이 비여섯다)
翌 29日도 亦 晴天인데 金 李 羅氏와 伴하야 熙川公園 舊 城跡 鍊武亭 七星峯을 두루 求景하고 熙川江에서 銀鱗을 釣하야 香酒 數盃로 熙川을 賞하고 客懷를 雪하얏다. 맛을 볼 바에는 熙川雨까지도 엇던가 보라고 天神은 甘雨數滴을 降하야 준다. 그러라고 함신마저 주니 그 亦 그럴 듯 하얏다.
암우리 生覺하야도 平生 숙원이든 香山 求景을 안하고는 못 살겟다. 本來 趙氏 一行의 예정지이지만 내가 橫奪할 밧게 別數 업다. 에라 趙氏에게 告訴를 當할 셈 치고 橫奪하자.
나는 香山行을 決하얏다. 翌 30日 麗明에 簡單한 行裝으로 李嵕塤氏와 갓치 徒步로 香山 50里에 登하얏다.

關西名勝 妙香山
關西 名勝 妙香山은 朝鮮國祖 檀君 神人이 誕降處로 朝鮮 8大名山의 1로 太白, 妙香, 蛾嵋의 3名을 有한 것으로 大同, 淸川, 兩大江이 挾流함으로 寧邊, 德川, 熙川, 价川 等 10州의 分界가 됨으로 高句麗 金蛙王의 誕生地로 名僧 西山 泗溟이 修道處로 名勝으로 古跡으로 其名이 天下에 冠한 것은 世人이 숙지하는 바다. 西山大師(休靜)는 4山을 評하야 金剛은 秀而不壯 智異는 壯而不秀 9月은 不壯不秀 妙香은 亦壯亦秀라 하야 香山을 朝鮮의 一로 놉혀 노앗다. 이러한 壯亦秀한 妙香山 何時에 機會 來하야 使我로 一見 妙香山은 兒童走卒이 願하는 바이다.＜60＞
이러한 香山을 이처럼 보게되니 行步와 心氣가 雀躍하얏다. 맛츰 中途에서 香山僧(日本留學生) 金承法氏를 만내여 同行이 되게 됨은 더욱 奇緣이엿다. 月林서 冷麵 1器式 맛잇게 먹고 月林江을 건녀 舊月林에서 李璟塤
裴晋英 兩氏를 만내여 이제부터 5人 同伴으로 香山行을 作하얏다.
香山洞口白石淸川을 밟으며 마시며 夕陽山路에 悠悠히 緩步를 運하야 一步에 一話 十步에 一烟 只在此洞口 谷深不知處를 連해 말하면서 尋眞亭에 小歇하야 外獅子項을 넘어 內獅子項을 도라드니 樹木이 울창한 그 속에 一大寺院이 즐비히 노여스니 이가 곳 香山의 主刹 朝鮮 5大寺의 一이 되는 普賢寺이다.
庭下에 배회하면서 山光水色을 一瞥하고 數步를 運하야 寺院 全景을 鑑賞하고서 客室에 入하야 旅服을 버서던지고 淸溪에 濯足하고 淨座에 放臥하니 行苦를 頓忘에 心身이 俱足하다. 맛츰- 庭前이 들내이며 學生 一隊가 드러온다. 엇던 學校인가 하야 마루에 나셔니 平壤 光成高等普通學校 修學旅行團 20名 一行이다. 山中逢學生 便是知己人으로 엇지나 반가운지- 個中에는 適- 나의 母校 京城 普成高等普通學校 今年 卒業生 文學善君이 끼여 잇다. 더욱 반가웟다. 이윽고 山珍野香이 口腹을 慰하니 餘念이 다시 업다. 金承法氏에게 寺의 來歷 山의 全景을 뭇고 자리에 누으려할 제 一殊常漢이 訪來하니 얼핏 보아도 巡査 나부랑이 갓다. 「당신 어대서 왓소」 「네 서울서 왓소」 「서울서 왜 왓소」 「求景왓소 그래 왜 뭇소」 「안이 글세요 客報를 할냐구요」 말이 엇지 無識스럽고도 안이꼬운지 픽 웃고 말엇다.
그런데 이와 갓흔 大刹에 엇재 僧侶가 안이 보일가. 勞働者 10數人 食事에 奔走한 數名의 壯丁이 보일 뿐이고 僧侶란 다- 逃亡을 갓는지 隱伏을 하얏는지 도무지 안이 보인다. 經소리 鐘소리 寂然無聞이다. 住持 朴普峯君은 점잔아 그런지 잠이 만아 그런지 來客을 찻기는 姑捨하고 「보입겟슴니다」 해도 「就寢 中이시라」고 明日見을 傳達한다. 心思가 불뚝하얏다.
普賢寺는 本來 高麗 第4世 光宗王 19年 距今 900餘 年 前에 龍興郡人 探密祖師의 安心寺 創建에 始하야 其後 高麗 第5世 景宗 3年에 探密의 高弟(親子) 宏廓法師의 創建한 바 (創建 當時 24個 殿所에 3,000 僧侶를 敎養하얏다 한다) 其後 累頹累建 凡 6次의 重刱을 繼하야 只今에 至하얏다 한다. 10餘 年 前만 해도 寺院이 꽤 殷盛하고 僧侶도 多數엿고 學校까지 經營하든 터인데 9年 前 乙卯年 漲水에 山崩寺頹되고 民家 100餘 戶가 流失＜61＞人民 數百名이 傷한 뒤로는 그만 運去勢盡하야 只今의 寂寞狀態를 呈하얏다 한다. 山에 樹木이 젹고 沙汰가 만으며 洞口에 人家가 업고 轉石이 塡充된 것만 보아도 그때 慘狀을 可히 알겟다. 寺의 財産은 所有地가 香山 全幅 約 7萬餘 町步이며 秋收錢이 約 萬餘 圓이라 한다. 그리 貧寺는 안이다. 안이 30本山의 第6位에 가는 富刹이라 한다. 그것을 무슨 公益事業에 投하지 안는 것은 무슨 守錢奴化인지? 안이 公益事業에 投資하랴는 氣味가 잇다고 傳한다. 感謝한 消息이다. 留學生이 7, 8人된다 함은 더욱 可賞한 일이다.
5月 31日 (木曜) 晴이다. 早起早飯은 寺中 通俗이다. 아무리 俗客이요 疲困漢인들 別數이스랴. 朝飯 後 住持 朴普峯氏를 차자 談話하고 光成學校 先生 尹宗植
康柄鍵쇼-氏를 차자 相歡相慰하얏다.
金承法氏 案內로 光成 一行과 갓치 求景을 떠낫다. 만츰 普賢 全軆를 보앗다. 曹溪門 西山大師 事跡碑(碑文 畧 佛敎通史 參考) 解脫門 天王門 萬歲樓 大雄殿 冥府殿 極樂殿(西山, 泗溟, 雷黙 3大師影 及 遺物) 酬忠祠(西山書院 李朝賜) 等 各 寺院을 巡鑑하얏다.

香山의 異跡 及 逸話
妙香 一名은 方丈이요 (金履喬 詩云 古稱 海外之山有方丈故) 一名은 峨媚요 一名은 太白 (白壁如雪 故로 太白 又云 凌霄 李靑蓮之風彩 西山云 峨嵋山界正如銀望之如李太白之風神英爽)이요 一名은 妙香(山多香木冬有靑 故로 探密大神刱寺 時名 妙香 又云警世白樂天之文章故香山 雪嶺大師詩云 山在淸川蕯水源雄蟠西塞接天門 更着黃落千林後 香木靑雪裏痕妙香播名如白香山之文章)이라 한다. 山이고 水이고 人이고 物이고 中國을 依倣치 안코는 된 것이 업다. 妙香山에까지 中國으로 中毒을 식켯다. 우리의 先人들이야말로 더럽게도 中國에 忠僕이엿지.

一. 檀君事蹟
古記云昔有天神桓因命庶子雄持天符三印率三千降于太白山檀木下謂之神市主人問三百事此有一熊常祈于神願化爲人神造*艾二炷蒜二枚曰食此不見日光便得人形態食之七日得女神又視願有孕神假化爲婚而孕生子是爲檀君
太白行云檀*遙想化熊初正是東方民立極香爐峰南岩有**高四丈南北五肘東西三肘自然爲鐵堂(東肘逆出玉泉)古檀*其上世傳檀君降生處今云登天窟(桓雄自此登天故名)其南十里許檀君*世傳檀君講武處其*下有窟亦稱檀君窟其北有檀君*杖*內*鉢檀君庵香積庵北有聖庵爲桓因桓雄檀君而所建＜62＞
이것은 普賢寺 事蹟記에서 抄한 것이다. 紙面을 畧하기 爲하야 演意는 그만 둔다. 이것 뿐으로도 檀君의 誕降에 對한 當時 事蹟은 알만하다.

一. 天帝子解慕漱事蹟
世傳天帝子解慕漱降于扶餘地乘龍車從者百餘止態心山(今香山仙遊峰)朝則聽事暮則升天世謂之天王卽見河伯女柳花出遊以*劃地而室成置酒設席河伯奴遣使曰汝是何人留我女王曰我是天帝子願與結婚遂與女同乘龍車到其宮河伯迎謂曰王是天帝子有何神異王曰惟在所試於是河伯化爲鯤王卽化爲瀨河伯異之遂舘甥而成禮王卽恐河伯無將女之意乘其大醉欲與升天未出水而河伯卽醒謂其女曰汝不從吾訓擅離辱門貶流*渤水
此亦參考로 一端을 紹介하고 畧한다.

異蹟과 傳說을 다- 쓰자하니 紙面도 업거니와 支離하기도 하다. 荇人國 定都의 事記도 잇고 妙香法界 8萬의 說도 잇고 獨聖(5百羅漢의 一) 由雪峯顯聖之說도 잇고 元曉擲盤의 事蹟도 잇고 迷信 만고 傳說 만흔 寺院인지라 別別 怪說 奇說이 만타. 눈 딱 감고 끈어버리겟다. 其中에 西山四溟에 對한 事記나 좀 紹介하얏스면- 하나 그 亦 그리할 必要가 업다.  다만 西山大師의 本名은 玄應이고 法名은 休靜이고 自號는 淸虛이든 것과 完山 崔氏로 其先이 安州에 謫居한 事와 佛家 高僧으로 香山에 常住한 事와 壬辰倭亂에 數千兵을 招集하야 弟子 義嚴, 泗溟, (惟政) 雷黙 (處英) 等으로 日兵과 戰爭한 事와 國一都大禪師禪敎都總攝으로 佛에 家國에 兩全한 事와 85歲의 壽로 香山에서 入寂한 事- 그것 뿐을 알면 그만이겟다. 氏의 入寂時에 遺한 「80年前渠是我80年後我是渠」의 一句는 무슨 깁흔 뜻이 잇나보다.＜63＞
우리 一行은 普賢寺 一圓을 求景하고 이제부터는 香山의 名勝 上院庵을 가게 되얏다. 一日 豫定이 上院庵으로 檀君臺까지 갓다가 普賢에 回來할 터이닛가 빨니 단니지 안으면 안되겟다. 튼튼한 短杖 한개식을 들고 으얏차 드얏차 山에 오르게 되얏다. 元氣 만코 興致 만흔 中學生 一隊와 步調를 맛추게 되니 氣運이 百*나 더- 난다. 나무를 휘여잡으며 돌을 거더차며 물 건너 山넘어 僅僅히 올나가니 시원한 中嶺上이다.
올녀다 보니 山은 層層 놉핫는데 上上峯을 法王峯이라 하며 내려다보니 물은 출렁 깁헛는데 水名이 아직 업다 한다. 探密峯 上에 까마귀 떼 넘어가고 劒峯中層에는 白雲이 풀풀 휘돌고 잇다. 法王峯은 엇지나 놉흔지 맛치 「石轉千年不到底手長一尺可摩天」의 感이 난다. 白雲深處有人家라드니 山上絶處有農圃는 이야말로 稀罕하다. 老農夫妻- 한가히 호미질을 하니 山水도 自然 農老도 自然 人間世上 갓지는 안타. 漸漸이 登上하니 果然 적으마-한 草幕이 보인다. 차자 드러가 俗客來를 告하니 老婆 두 분이 두부 만들냐고 磨돌질을 하고 잇다. 祭祀가 잇느냐 무르니 上院庵에 가져갈 두부라 한다. 무서워서 엇더케 사느냐 하닛가 山神이 도아준다고 한다. 아들 딸 工夫 식켜보랴느랴 하닛가 口腹이 원수라고만 한다. 그래도 도야지도 먹이고 송아지도 먹이고 닭도 친다.
또 가자 어서 가자 하야 層層히 올나셔니 上院庵 近傍이라 한다. 10餘 丈이나 되는 鐵索을 느리운 急崖이다. 여긔서는 누구든지 罪가 잇스면 잇는 대로 自白을 하고야 올나가지 그러치 안으면 떠러저 죽는다고 한다. 平壤 날탕 金鳳伊 先達이 婦女들을 꼬여 香山 求景을 식키며 이곳에서 自白說을 聽取하야 騰*本을 해가지고 衣服 불버선커리나 잘 엇어 신엇다는 말이 여기서 난 말이다. 果然 兒女子는 속으리만치 急하고 무섭다. 鐵索을 지내 올나서니 이곳이야말로 香山의 第一景 안이 金剛山에서도 일즉 보지 못한 天下의 景. 上院庵前 寅虎臺이다. 遠景은 그만 두고 眼前 足下에 當한 近景만 그려보자. 글로 써볼가. 그림으로 그려볼가 말로 해볼가. 書與言이 俱絶된다. 그지- 어허참- 어허참- 하고 입맛만 다실 뿐이다.
