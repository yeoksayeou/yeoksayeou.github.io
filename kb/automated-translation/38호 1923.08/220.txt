Miscellaneous Odds and Ends Gathered at the Border

What is most plentiful in Sinŭiju?
It would be nice to offer a reward, but who can endure this impatient nature? What is most plentiful in Sinŭiju? Grain? Freight? Fish? No. Then, white pills (백알)? Knives (칼표)? Extortion (분탕)? No. Then, scorpions (蝎蜅)? Gamblers? Ruffians (亂捧)? No—all wrong. It's smugglers (密輸入者) and spies (密偵).
As for how numerous the smugglers are, moving things from here to there, and from there to here—ginseng, opium, tobacco, liquor, and other things—strapped to their testicles, put in the soles of their feet, stuck in soybean paste jars, placed under rice bowls; how cleverly they manage the procedures to get things through! Their numbers are vast, and their skills are considerable.
Therefore, as is customary, there must be many spies too, since it's the border. Police spies, customs spies, Monopoly Bureau spies; they say you can't even move for all the spies. If those spies uncover just one thing, they supposedly hit it big. Among them, customs spies, often ruffians (無賴漢), do it for free, but in return, if they just expose a smuggler, they are given half of the confiscated goods. Village bumpkins (村外入쟁이) drool, saying it's worth doing.

Won't Lose When It Comes to Insults
Being the border, there are many strange people, and many strange comedies arise. Where people from three countries—Korea, China, and Japan—gather, such comedies often unfold, they say.
The quick-tempered Japanese person, if something doesn't suit their taste, typically flies into a rage, yelling "Kora Jjankoro—" (고라짱고로-) hurling insults at the Chinese person. The stolid Chinese person, with their thick, blue lips, retorts with "Tamana gabiguju" (타마나가비구즈) (狗子 - dog), throwing back an insult. And the resourceful Korean person, assessing the situation, takes the advantageous side, either chiming in with "Hey, Waenom" (요-왜놈 - Jap bastard) or "Hey, Toenom-a" (이- 되놈아 - Chink bastard), taking a side.
Thus, the people of the three countries each have distinct insulting nicknames (辱名). The Korean insult for Japanese is "Waenom" (왜놈) or "Sŏmnom" (셤놈) (Island person), and for Chinese, it's "Toenom" (되놈) or "Orangkae" (오랑캐) (barbarian). The Chinese insult for Japanese <96> is typically "Gujŭ" (구즈) (狗子 - dog), and for Koreans, it's typically "Kkŏulli" (꺼울리) (Goryeo). The Japanese insult for Chinese is typically "Jjankoro" (짱고로) (derived from a Chinese boat name), and for Koreans, it's typically "Yobosang" (요보상). This is also worth knowing once.

I Am the Prefect (府尹)
Such small-minded thinking, it's truly pathetic. A certain Prefect (府尹) of Sinŭiju once went to Andong County (安東縣), bought a bundle of knife money (刀票), and finding it somewhat awkward to carry it openly, hailed a Chinese rickshaw. He hid the bundle of knife money under the footrest of the rickshaw's lower platform and crossed the bridge. However, an experienced and meticulous customs official searched his body and then checked under the rickshaw's footrest. "Baka nan da—" (빠가난다-) the official cursed and was about to confiscate the knife money when the Prefect declared, "Boku wa—" (복구와-) and presented a name card identifying himself as the "Sinŭiju Prefect" (新義州府尹). The customs official stared intently at his face, then said, "Doniga kakkugo korewao- syu" (돈이 각구 고례와오- 슈) and confiscated it anyway. Perhaps out of respect for his position, or perhaps due to sympathy between fellow countrymen, the matter didn't escalate to a fine. Ah, shameful—truly shameful.

There's Also a Frivolous Washerwoman (漂母)
Directly across from T'onggun Pavilion (統軍亭) in Ŭiju, in the middle of the Yalu River (鴨綠江), stands the imposing Ma'i Mountain (馬耳山) (also called Ho'i Mountain - 虎耳山). Behind it is the river, and in front is the river, essentially an island mountain. This mountain is said to possess spiritual power. Foreseeing Korea's destiny across the river and predicting its great rise, it deemed Korea a place worthy to stand (可立之地). Despite the earnest pleas of the mountains to its left and right in China to stay, it was leaping across to Korea. At that time, a washerwoman (漂母) by the Yalu River, whether seized by mischief (㥘이 大作) or foreseeing misfortune (不祥), struck the energetically leaping mountain with her laundry stick (빨내방망이). So the mountain cried "Ouch!" (아야) and plopped down right into the middle of the river. As a result, what was originally one river split into two, and the mountain has since been unable to escape China's command (命). The mountain, still looking across at Korea, constantly laments its unfulfilled intention (未遂意) and resents that washerwoman of yore. If only someone had the strength to just lift it up and move it across—

High, High Position; Virtue Returns East (高高位 德歸東)
Perhaps Yi T'aejo (李太祖) was the man full of wisdom and stratagems. Yi T'aejo, as a great general of Goryeo (高麗), led ten thousand troops on an expedition to the Central Plain (中原) in the depths of winter. Harboring a secret plot in his heart, he planned to turn his army back midway and reached Wihwa Island (威化島), where he encamped his troops. T'aejo pondered day and night, "How can I turn the army back?" "How can I seize the throne?" devising his plan. One night (whether true or false), he had a dream and told his subordinates, "Last night, I had a dream <97> in which I saw three trees lying across an ancient tomb (古墳). What fortune or misfortune does this portend? Summon a fortune-teller (卜者)!" A subordinate introduced an old woman (老婆), who immediately interpreted, "It is an auspicious dream (吉夢). An ancient tomb forms the character '一' (il - one), and three trees (三木) lying across it form the character '王' (wang - king)." T'aejo rejoiced inwardly. The next night, he claimed to have had another dream and described it to his subordinates as before, saying, "Last night, I had another dream. In a place where chickens crowed 'kkokko wi' (꼬꼬위), I heard the sound of a millstone pounding 'tŏlgŭdŏng tŏlgŭdŏng' (덜그덩 덜그덩). What fortune or misfortune does this signify?" The old woman also immediately interpreted, "It is an auspicious dream. The chickens crowing 'kkokko wi' means 'high, high position' (高高位 - Ko Ko Wi), and the sound of the millstone 'tŏlgŭdŏng tŏlgŭdŏng' means 'virtue returns East' (德歸東 - Tŏk Kwi Tong). Your Majesty should immediately turn the army back. Virtue (德) is returning to the East (東)." Thereupon, T'aejo, greatly pleased that his plan was succeeding, promptly turned the army back. Feigning caution, he gauged that a north wind was about to rise and declared, "We cannot act rashly trusting only dream interpretations. It is proper to follow Heaven's will (天意). Let us raise a flag and advance in the direction it points." As it happened, facing the north wind blowing from Manchuria (滿洲), the flag fluttered eastward (東). Declaring, "Now our fortune (運) has come!" he turned the army back. On the return journey, he devised another scheme to completely subdue the hearts of the multitude. Reaching the Yŏk River (逆江) (Ŭiju), he threw small pieces of wood into the water according to the wind's direction, saying, "If my eastward advance is right, let them flow east; if a westward advance is right, let them flow west." Just then, a west wind arose, and carried by the wind, the wood flowed slightly eastward against the current. T'aejo declared all this to be Heaven's will and, advancing with the returning army, promptly occupied the capital (王都). Whether this is truth or fabrication, who knows, but such is the scheming of heroes (英雄).

Story of How Im Kwaksan (林郭山) Gathered Money
Though deceased, most probably guess that Im Kwaksan (尙沃) of Ŭiju represents the great wealth of the Northwest in recent times. As for how he amassed his fortune, initially, as a country fellow (싀골漢), he took an interest in commerce and frequented the markets. Coming to the capital (京城), he became a retainer (門客) of Minister Pak (朴某), who held the rank of Panseo (判書) at the time. Minister Pak was poor then, and when his mother passed away, Im contributed four thousand nyang (냥) for the funeral expenses. Later, Minister Pak tested Im, asking, "How many pedestrians pass through Namdaemun Gate (南大門通) daily?" Im promptly replied, "Two people: gain (利) and loss (害)." The Minister acknowledged, saying, "You are suited for commerce (商). How about engaging in business (商事)?" and gave him eight thousand nyang in cash. Through this, he gradually gained trust. With Pak's introduction, Im obtained a special government license for the wholesale purchase of ginseng (人蔘都買特許) and entered China with tens of thousands of pounds (斤) of ginseng. At that time, the Chinese distrusted Im and did not buy the ginseng. Im, realizing a great failure, resorted to the extraordinary measure of a giant (巨人) and burned the entire stock of ginseng. Thereupon, the Chinese, impressed by his magnanimous character (人氣), each requested several thousand pounds. Im then re-entered China with tens of thousands more pounds of ginseng. The ginseng buyers numbered in the tens and hundreds <98>, and he immediately acquired tens of thousands of silver chests (銀箱), piled high like the Southern Mountain (南山). Thereupon, sometimes dispersing, sometimes storing, sometimes engaging in social connections, sometimes contributing to public benefit (公益), he gained great trust (信用). Through several hundred trips, he acquired wealth worth tens of thousands of gold (金), and was called "Korea's great figure, the great merchant of both countries, Im Sangok (林尙沃)." Later, he served as the Magistrate of Kwaksan County (郭山縣監) and Governor of Kusŏng Prefecture (龜城府使) before passing away.

Where is Ŭl P'aso's (乙巴素) Tomb?
The famous prime minister of Koguryŏ (高句麗), Ŭl P'aso (乙巴素), is said to originally be from Ŭiju (義州). His tomb and shrine are currently located in Sanggyŏng-ri, Oksang-myŏn, Ŭiju-gun (義州郡 玉尙面 上庚里). The residents of the myeon still hold memorial rites (享祀) twice a year, in spring and autumn. Until the annexation (合邦), the government exempted the villagers of that dong (洞) from taxes, it is said. If only I had the leisure of a few days, I would have paid a visit, but alas—

A So-called Provincial Councilor (道評議員)
There's no value in evaluating those fellows from the countryside who, thanks to their ancestors' virtue, have a bit of money, and under the appeasing measures (撫慰的 手段) of the government office, strut around puffing out their chests and clearing their throats ("Ehem") having obtained a Provincial Councilor position, much like former clerks (主事) or minor officials (參奉). However, hearing about it makes me so nauseated (逆症) that I must fire off a word and be done with it. A certain Kil Mo (吉某) from Hŭich'ŏn (熙川), quite advanced in age, considered wealthy in the mountain villages, and even bearing the title of Provincial Councilor—a man who should be content eating pig heads in spring and autumn—finding his 'Way' (道) blocked and unable to devise a plan, dragged out the dilapidated Guan Yu Shrine (關王廟) in a corner of the town (邑內). He proposed its reconstruction (重刱), gathered people, moved the Guan Yu Shrine (關廟) to Ch'ilsŏng Mountain (七星山) in front of the town, erected a stele (碑), collects money twice a year in spring and autumn, slaughters cows (牛) and kills pigs (猪) to hold grand rites (大祭), they say. Despite this, if someone approaches him regarding public interest, he reportedly turns his back before even exchanging greetings. And such types are Provincial Councilors... Oh, how laughable.

The Pointless Governor-General's Procession (總督行次)
Like "How can one catch a tiger cub without entering the tiger's den?" (不入虎穴安得虎子), Saitō-kun (齋藤), who recently visited the border under the pretext of a border procession and inspection of public sentiment (民情視察), making a great adventure and bold decision—whatever feelings he himself may have had—among the local populace, the "pointless Governor-General's procession" became a topic of conversation, leading to much scoffing and even exasperation (하피염). Never mind the populace; even a subordinate, a certain Japanese forestry bureau technician (森林局 技師日本人 某), was seen complaining bitterly. Departing without notice, arriving without notice, with no communication (去不知來不知無消息通), he entrusted his entire being to trains, cars, and steamships. Upon arrival at landing spots or lodging places, he was surrounded by armed police, with officials preceding and guarding the rear (前衛後御), creating a situation where faces could not be looked upon nor feet approached (顔不敢望足不敢近). What public sentiment inspection, what border inspection is that? Despite the journey undertaken with much ado, after entering Kanggye (江界) by car from Anju (安州), spending one night in Kanggye and one night in Manp'ojin (滿浦鎭), he promptly boarded a steamship and beat a hasty retreat (走字), they say. However, <99> holding banquets with several dozen local dignitaries (郡民 有志) in Kanggye and *P'o (浦) was considered a great act of courage (大勇斷) for a Governor-General.

Strange Customs, Again Strange Customs (怪風 又 怪風)
Going to Mao'er Mountain (帽兒山), the devastating traces of the great fire are still there. Over eight hundred large buildings were burned down, with losses exceeding thirty million won (圓), they say. When asked why a fire that started in broad daylight wasn't extinguished preventively, and why goods weren't rescued, they say there was nothing else they could do. Chinese merchants managing their own businesses with their own capital, of course, even in such emergencies, desperately try to save goods and protect buildings. However, merchants operating under others (남의 압흐로 하는 상인), upon the outbreak of a fire, typically close their doors and flee, they say. (Whether this custom - 江邊風 - is unique to the riverside area, I don't know). Why? Because if they manage to save even a few goods at such a time, the owner reportedly demands compensation for all the burned goods as well. If everything burns down, there's no issue. Therefore, small merchants working for large ones (大商의 前小商人), whenever a fire breaks out, reportedly lock their doors and flee, waiting for everything to burn down to avoid paying compensation. Strange customs, again strange customs.

Chinese Officials Holding Cakes in Both Hands (左右執餠)
Whether rumor or fact, such talk is common along the river. Fortunate Chinese officials, Chinese officials eating from both sides, imposing Chinese officials, they are called. Why? Because Japanese officials give them money, liquor, food, and rice cakes, asking them to catch Korean independence activists (朝鮮獨立軍). Meanwhile, the independence activists cannot help but sweeten their mouths (입을 달게하지 안을 수 업다고), asking them to inform them if Japanese officials come, not to catch them, and to help the independence cause. Thus, the Chinese officials, like calves caught in a ditch, eat from both sides, and are all said to be sitting pretty (쌀 담울에 올나 안젓다고). Seems plausible.

The Problematic "Reproduction Not Permitted" (不許覆載)
A certain former police inspector (警部) Kang (姜무어) from the Ch'osan (楚山) Police Station, how utterly ignorant (沒常識) he was! He visited a devoted reader of "Kaebyŏk" (開闢), stated the need for an investigation, and asked for the magazine. Flipping through it here and there, he saw the four characters "不許復載" (Reproduction Not Permitted) on the copyright page (板權狀), his eyes widened, and he declared, "This book is subversive (不穩), so I'm taking it." Ignoring objections, he was about to take it away. "Why? What's subversive about it?" the reader asked. Kang reportedly explained, adding commentary, "Looking at 'Reproduction Not Permitted,' it must certainly be a dangerous book. What more is there to say? If it weren't subversive, why wouldn't reproduction be allowed?" and took it. A few days later, he returned, tossed the book back saying, "Here, take your book," and left. Apparently, he received a thorough scolding for his utter ignorance from the police chief (署長). The chief must have had at least that much common sense. Kang probably strutted around thinking he'd get a promotion <100> for confiscating a subversive document. With types like this serving as police officers, imagine the frustrating things the local people must endure. Ah, Ding Kou Zhu Tian (丁口竹天 - an obscure phrase, possibly expressing frustration or absurdity).

Absurd Exercise of Rights (腰折할 권리행사)
Traveling around, one hears many absurd (腰折할) things. This too is a story heard in Ch'osan, and it's quite funny.
Some theater troupe (演*團派) reportedly came to Ch'osan. There was something suspicious regarding public morals (風俗) in the play. So, a member of the audience, Mr. X (某氏), stood up and heckled, "Hey, that's harmful to public morals (風俗妨害)!" A police officer (also an Inspector - 警部) who was present, grasping his sword hilt, abruptly stood up and said, "Hey, you have no right to say that. The police are here; it's the police's job to know and act." He sternly rebuked the audience member for doing something the police hadn't noticed, despite having no authority. The heckler retorted, "Listen—even in the Imperial Diet (帝國議會場), which is much more significant than this, people heckle. Where is the law that says only police can heckle and the audience cannot?" The officer became so enraged that the next day, he summoned the heckler on charges of infringing on police authority (警官의 권리 橫侵) and disobeying police instructions (警官의 훈계 불복). Forced by the summons (令), the heckler went. The officer, feigning authority he didn't possess, slammed his desk, saying, "Where is such a law? You stubborn brat!" It was so ludicrous that the heckler laughed and said, "You are too ignorant; let's ask the chief (署長)." He rushed into the chief's office and explained the situation. The chief, seemingly finding it absurd too, smirked faintly and told him to leave. Side-splittingly funny (腰折 抱腹).

The Miser's (守錢奴) End
A man named Ch'oe Pongaek (崔鵬鶴) in Pyŏktong Pyŏktan (碧潼碧團) reportedly amassed quite a fortune but died last year from a bullet fired by independence activists. Not everyone who lives with money gets killed, but this man was such a miser (守錢奴) that he wouldn't spend a single penny (떡 돈 한푼). When approached about public projects like schools or training centers, his usual contribution, after ten or a hundred requests, was exactly one won (一圓). When independence activists came, he would avoid them ten or a hundred times. If finally cornered, he would tell them to come back tomorrow or the day after, deceiving them ten or a hundred times. Then he would give them a seemingly heavy pouch (뵌 주머니) containing fake items (假物), telling them to open it later. When they finally opened it, they would find just a single one-won bill (一圓자리) tucked inside scraps of paper or old cloth. So, unable to bear it any longer, they sent him a bullet. Consequently, his family scattered, and his house stands empty, they say. Furthermore,
In Chŏnch'ang, Ch'angsŏng (昌城田倉), another money-grubber (錢鬼) named Kang Hŭngguk (康興國) lived and died this spring in exactly the same manner as the fellow from Pyŏktong. In Pyŏktong and Ch'angsŏng, this has become quite the story, passed from house to house.

Why So Many Sŏlsŏng (雪城 - Snow Castles) Along the River?
"Snow fell in the sixth month, creating castle grounds" (六月降雪以作城趾) – this legend, claiming a castle was being built there but moved here, is used to call the county Sŏlsŏng (雪城). This applies to Ch'osan (楚山), Pyŏktong (碧潼), Ch'angsŏng (昌城), and Sakchu (朔州) as well. What possessed Heaven (天) to make snow fall in the sixth month? Was it an auspicious event (祥事) or an ill omen (亡事)? They proudly boast that the county seat (郡邑) was established upon these castle grounds, but truly, snowfall in the sixth month is an inauspicious sign (不祥事). <101>

**Summary**

This article, titled "Miscellaneous Odds and Ends Gathered at the Border," is a collection of anecdotes and observations from the Sino-Korean border region around Sinŭiju in 1923. It paints a picture of a bustling, complex border life marked by smuggling, espionage, and tense interactions between Koreans, Chinese, and Japanese, complete with their respective derogatory nicknames. The author recounts tales of local figures like a clumsy prefect, a legendary mountain stopped by a washerwoman, Yi T'aejo's cunning rise to power, the entrepreneurial success and eventual official career of merchant Im Sangok, the neglected tomb of Koguryŏ premier Ŭl P'aso, criticism of a self-serving Provincial Councilor, the perceived futility of the Governor-General's tightly controlled inspection tour, peculiar local customs among Chinese merchants during fires, the advantageous position of Chinese officials dealing with both Japanese authorities and Korean independence fighters, the ignorance of a Japanese police inspector misinterpreting "Reproduction Not Permitted," an absurd clash over the right to heckle at a play, and the violent ends met by notorious misers at the hands of independence activists. The article concludes with a reflection on the recurring "Snow Castle" (Sŏlsŏng) place name legend in several border counties.

For historians, this article offers valuable glimpses into the social dynamics, cultural interactions, and political tensions in the Korean borderlands under Japanese colonial rule. Particularly interesting are the casual descriptions of smuggling and spying activities, the open use of ethnic slurs reflecting everyday friction, the criticism directed not only at Japanese officials but also at collaborating Korean elites (like the Provincial Councilor) and opportunistic Chinese officials, the accounts of independence activists' activities (including targeted killings of perceived collaborators or uncooperative wealthy individuals), and the depiction of the colonial state's presence (police, customs, Governor-General's tour) as both intrusive and sometimes inept or detached from local realities.

기사제목	국경에서 어든 雜同散異
기사형태	잡저

국경에서 어든 雜同散異
新義州에는 무엇이 제일 만흔가?
懸賞이라도 거러 노으면 됴켓다만은 급한 성미에 참을 수 잇나. 新義州에는 무엇이 제일 만흘가? 穀物? 貨物? 漁物? 안이다. 그러면 백알? 칼표? 분탕? 안이다. 그러면 蝎蜅? 노름군? 亂捧? 안이다- 다 안이다. 密輸入者하고 密偵이다.
密輸入者가 엇지 만흔지 여기ㅅ 것을 저기로 저기ㅅ 것을 여기로 人蔘 阿片 煙草 酒類 기타의 것을 불알에 차고 발바당에 넛코 된장 통에 꼿고 밥그릇에 깔고 하야 엇지도 교묘히 手續을 해서 빼여 돌니는지 그- 수도 만커니와 그- 才操도 能하다고.
그러닛가 依例로 密偵도 만켓지. 國境이고 하닛가. 警察密偵 稅關密偵 專賣局密偵, 밀정 담으네 도무지 치어설 수 업다고. 그- 密偵은 무엇이든지 한아만 발각을 식키면 큰 수가 난다나. 그 즁 稅關密偵갓흔 것은 無賴漢들이 무료로 해주는데 대신에 密輸入者를 발각만 식켜주면 압수물의 半分을 준다고. 그것도 할 만하다고 村外入쟁이들은 침을 흘닌다나.

辱에는 지지 안켓다
國境이닛가 별 사람도 만커니와 별 희극도 만히 난다고. 朝鮮사람 中國사람 日本사람 세 나라 사람이 모인는 곳에는 간간히 이러한 희극이 버러진다한다.
성미 급한 日本사람은 무엇이 비위에 맛지만 안으면 依例로 성을 와락 내이며 「고라짱고로-」하고 中國사람에게 욕을 건네이면 뚝뚝한 中國사람은 그- 두텁고 푸른 입술로 「타마나가비구즈」(狗子) 하고 욕을 건너이며 또 꾀 만흔 朝鮮사람은 形勢보아 利한 편으로 겻들며 「요-왜놈」 하는지 「이- 되놈아」하든지 하야 편을 드러준다나.
이레케 삼국인은 별칭 辱名이 각각 잇는데 朝鮮人 對日本人 욕은 「왜놈 안이면 「셤놈」(島)이고 對中國人 욕은 「되놈」안이면 「오랑캐」이고 中國人 對日本人＜96＞ 욕은 依例로 「구즈」(狗子)이고 對朝鮮人 욕은 의례로 「꺼울리」(高麗)이고 日本人 對中國人 욕은 의례로 「짱고로」(짱고로는 中國식 船名)이고 對朝鮮人 욕은 의례로 「요보상」이라 한다. 이것도 한번 아라둘 것.

나는 府尹이거니
고- 속 좁은 생각에 그러기도 상사렷다. 新義州 府尹 모는 언으때 安東縣을 갓다가 칼표(刀票)를 한통 사서 그대로 들고오기는 좀―무엇하닛가 중국인력거를 불너타고 인력거 下臺 발드디는 밋헤다가 칼표통을 감추어가지고 다리를 건녀는데 경험만코 찬찬한 세관관리는 몸을 뒤져보다가 인력거 발드딘 밋틀 뒤젓다나. 「빠가난다-」하고 욕을 건너며 칼표를 압수하랴닛가 者는 「복구와-」하고 「新義州府尹」이라 肩書한 名啣를 내대엿다나. 그러닛가 세관은 얼굴을 뚜러지게 보더니 「돈이 각구 고례와오- 슈」하고 빼앗고 마럿다한다. 그래도 체면을 보아주엇던지 동족끼리닛가 사정을 두엇든지 벌금문제까지는 밋지 안엇다고. 아- 창피-대창피.

방졍마즌 漂母도 잇지
義州統軍亭 바로 건너편 鴨綠江中에는 兀然한 馬耳山(일명 虎耳山)이 잇다. 뒤로 강 압흐로 江卽島山인데 此山이 본래- 영험이 잇는지라 朝鮮의 地氣를 건너 미리 보고 운이 大振할 것을 짐작하고 可立之地라하야 中國의 左右山이 懇曲키 挽留함도 불구하고 朝鮮으로 뛰여 건너오는 판인데 당시 鴨강변의 一漂母는 㥘이 大作하얏든지 不祥을 예측하얏든지 氣勢조케 건너뛰는 산을 빨내방망이로 탁 갈겻다나. 그래서 산은 그만 「아야」하고 江中에 탁 주저안고 마럿다한다. 그래서 當初는 一江이든 것이 二江으로 分派가되고 산은 從是 中國의 명을 未免하얏다한다. 산은 지금도 朝鮮을 건녀 미리보고 항상- 未遂意를 嘆하면서 그때 그 漂母를 怨한다고. 누가 힘만 좀 -쓰면 낭큼 드러 건너노아스면―

高高位 德歸東
智謀만코 策略만흔 사람은 李太祖이든가 보다. 李太祖-高麗의 대장으로 深冬에 萬軍을 率하야 中原에 遠征할 세 胸中에 음모가 有한지라 中途 反軍을 計하고 威化島에 至하야 군사를 駐屯하얏다. 太祖는 晝夜로 생각하되 「如何則回軍고」 「如何則 王位를 占할고」하야 그- 계책을 講하더니 一夜는(眞인지 假인지) 一夢을 得하고 諸部下에게 謂하야 曰 「余- 昨夜에 一夢을＜97＞ 得하니 古墳에 三木이 橫함을 見하얏노니 그 길흉이 如何오. 卜者를 招來하라」한대 부하가 一老婆를 소개하니 老婆 卽解曰 「吉夢이니이다. 古墳은 일자형인데 거기에 三木이 橫하야스니 王字이니이다」하얏다. 太祖- 暗喜하얏다. 翌夜에 又 一夢을 得하얏다고 하고 諸部下에 전과 如히 설하야 曰 「昨夜에 又 一夢을 得하니 닭이 꼬꼬위 우는 곳에 방아찟는 소리 덜그덩 덜그덩나니 그- 길흉이 如何오」한대 노파 亦 卽해曰 「吉夢이니이다. 닭이 꼬꼬 위 우는 것은 高高位라는 意이고 방아소리 덜그덩 덜그덩 德歸東이라는 意이오니 왕은 須卽 回軍하소서. 德이 東으로 歸하니이다」하얏다. 이에 태조는 計- 入함애 大喜하야 즉히 回軍할세 짐즛 북풍이 將起함을 짐작하고 「夢說만 信하고 輕擧하지 못할지니 天意를 從함이 可하니 旗를 立하야 기발이 향하는 곳으로 進하자」하니 適- 滿洲로 吹來하는 북풍에 면한지라 旗가 東으로 翩득이는지라 茲에 運己來矣라하고 回軍하얏다. 回軍中途에 又一計를 生하야 群心을 아조 屈服식키니 즉 逆江(義州)에 至하야 風勢따라 小木을 投하며 曰 我-東進이 可卽東流하고 西進이 可則西流하라하니 맛츰 서풍이 기하는 때라 風勢따라 동으로 小小逆流하얏다. 太祖- 此皆天意라하야 回軍長進하야 卽히 王都를 占하얏다한늋�. 眞言인지 假言인지는 고사하고 영웅의 謀事란 蓋如此.

林郭山 돈 모으던 이약이
죽엇지만 義州 林郭山(尙沃)하면 근대 西北을 대표한 巨富인 줄은 대개 짐작할 것이다. 그가 엇더케 돈을 모앗는고 하니 당초에 일개 싀골漢으로 상업에 留意하야 市井에 출몰하다가 京城에 來하야 당시 判書 朴某의 門客이 되얏다. 時에 朴判書-窮하더니 母喪을 당한지라 임이 四千냥으로써 喪事에 補하얏더니 후에 朴判書「林을 試하야 「南大門通每日行人幾何」를 問하얏다. 林은 문득 대답하되 利害二人이라 하얏다. 判書는 諾하야 曰 「君은 商에 適하니 商事若何하오」하야 현금 八千냥을 與하얏다. 차로써 점차 신임되야 林은 朴의 소개로 정부로부터 人蔘都買特許를 得하야 인삼 幾萬斤으로써 中國에 入하얏다. 당시- 中國人은 林을 불신하고 蔘을 買치 안엇다. 林은 大敗를 覺하고 茲애 巨人의 비상수단으로 인삼전부를 燒盡하고 마럿다. 茲에 中國人은 그- 人氣가 장부다운데 惑하야 각각 幾千斤식을 要하얏다. 茲에 林은 다시 中國에 入하야 인삼 幾萬餘斤으로써 再行하니 蔘買者-일로 數十數百에＜98＞ 달하는지라 당장에 累萬銀箱을 得하니 積如南山이라. 茲에 或- 散하고 或- 貯하며 或- 交際 或- 公益으로 신용을 大得하야 幾百番 출입에 幾萬金 富를 得하니 稱曰 朝鮮의 대인물 兩國巨商 林尙沃이라 하얏다. 후에 郭山縣監龜城府使를 經하고 死하얏다고.

乙巴素墓는 어대잇는지
高句麗 名宰相 乙巴素는 본래 義州人이라 한다. 그리고 그의 묘와 사당이 지금 義州郡 玉尙面 上庚里에 在한데 面民이 지금것 春秋二次로 享祀를 지내이며 合邦前까지는 국가에서 該洞民에게 면세를 하얏다 한다. 日字의 여유만 잇더면 拜觀할 것인데 그만―

소위 道評議員이란 者가
싀골서 조상의 덕으로 금전 푼이나 가지고 관청의 撫慰的 手段 하에서 전에 主事 參奉하듯이 道評議員 낫치나 엇어하고 배를 내밀고 「에헴」하는 자들을 평할 가치는 업다만은 드르매 하도 逆症이 나서 한마듸 쏘고 말겟다. 熙川의 吉某란 나희도 상당히 먹고 재산도 산골서는 부자라 하고 도평의원이란 肩書까지 붓친 자로서 춘추 도야지ㅅ머리나 먹어야 될 터인데 그 道가 窮함에 計를 出하다 못하야 邑內一隔에 頹癈한 關王廟를 꺼집어드러 重刱의 議를 建하야 衆人을 모라 邑前 七星山上에 關廟를 移建하고 碑를 立하고 春秋二次 收錢을 하야 牛를 屠하고 猪를 殺하야 大祭를 행한다나. 그리면서도 공익을 위하야 누가 차자가면 인사도 전에 딱도라 안는다고 그 따위가 다- 도평의원 어허 우습지.

승거운 總督行次
「不入虎穴安得虎子」격으로 국경행차이니 민정시찰이니 하야 大冒險 大勇斷으로 저번 국경을 단녀온 齋藤군은 자기는 如何한 감이 잇든지 地方民間에는 「승거운 총독행차」를 話頭로 하야 비웃다 못하야 하피염하고 마는 일이 만타. 민간은 고사하고 소위 부하라는 森林局 技師日本人 某도 대히 빙정거리는 것을 보앗다. 去不知來不知無消息通으로 기차 자동차 蒸船속에 前身을 委하고 下陸地 投宿地에 입할 時는 무장경관으로 포위를 식키고 관속으로 前衛後御하야 顔不敢望足不敢近의 態를 作하얏스니 민정이 무어고 국경시찰이 무어냐고. 그나마 못처럼 떠난 길을 불구하고 安州서 자동차로 江界에 入하얏다가 江界一泊 滿浦鎭 一泊을 하고는 곳 蒸船으로 走字를 대고 마럿다고. 그러나＜99＞ 江界 *浦에서 郡民 有志 수 십인과 더부러 연회를 한 것은 총독당대의 大勇斷이라고.

怪風 又 怪風
帽兒山을 가닛가 大火의 跡이 그대로 처참히 잇다. 八百餘戶의 大건물이 燒盡하얏는데 손해가 三千萬圓 이상이라 한다. 白晝에 起한 火를 왜 미연에 消盡치 못하얏스며 물품은 왜 구출치 못하얏느냐 하닛가 그럴 밧게 업다고 한다. 中國상인은 자기자본으로 자기가 경영하는 자는 母論-이러한 위급한 때에도 한사코 물품을 구출하며 가옥을 善保하도록 애쓰나 남의 압흐로 하는 상인은 화재만 나면 의례로 문을 폐쇄하고 逸走하고 만다한다.(江邊風만 그런지는 모르나) 왜 그러냐하면 이런 때 만약- 물품을 조곰이라도 구출하기만 하면 주인은 燒盡된 물품까지 전부 손해배상을 밧는다 한다. 전부 燒盡된 경우는 문제가 업고. 그러닛가 大商의 前小商人은 화재만 나면 賠償 안이물겟다고 의례로 문을 폐하고 逸走하야 전부 小盡하기만 기다린다나. 怪風 又 怪風.

左右執餠의 中國官憲
風說인지 事實인지 여하간 江邊에는 이러한 말이 만타. 팔자조흔 中國官憲 좌우로 먹는 中國官憲 勢 당당한 中國官憲이라 한다. 왜그러냐하면 日本官憲은 그들에게 朝鮮독립군 잡아달나고 돈주고 술주고 밥주고 떡주고 하고 독립군은 그들에게 日本官憲오면 알켜달나고 잡아주지 마러달나고 독립을 도아달나고 그들의 입을 달게하지 안을 수 업다고. 이러케 中國官憲은 도랑에든 송아지 모양으로 좌우로 먹는데 모다 쌀 담울에 올나 안젓다고 전한다. 그도 그럴 듯.

문제의 「不許覆載」
楚山警察署의 前警部 姜무어라는 자는 엇지도 몰상식하얏든지 엇던 「開闢」애독자를 차자와서 조사의 필요를 말하고 開闢을 달나하야 이리 뒤젹 저리 뒤젹 하다가 板權狀에 「不許復載」 四字를 보고 눈이 뚱글해지더니 「이 책은 不穩한 책이닛가 내가 가져가오」하고 除雜談하고 가져가랴든가 「왜그러냐 무엇이 不穩이냐」하닛가 「不許復載라 한 것을 보면 母論 위험한 책이겟지 잡말이 무어야. 불온치 안으면 왜 復載를 못하느냐」고 설명까지 附하면서 가져갓다나― 그 뒤 멧츨 잇더니 다시 가지고 와서 「여보 책 밧으오」 툭 더지고 가드란다. 아마 서장 압헤 톡톡히 沒常識의 꾸지람을 밧은 모양이드라고. 서장은 그 맛 상식은 이슬터이닛가- 姜 그 자는 아마 不穩文書 압수해 와스니 한 줄을＜100＞ 나서나 하고 꿈벅거렷겟지. 이 따위들이 경관이니 그 지방인민이야 얼마나 속 상하는 꼴을 다 격글가. 아- 丁口竹天.

단니노라면 별 腰折할 말도 만히 듯겟지. 이것도 楚山서 드른 말인데 엇지 우스운지.
엇던 演*團派가 楚山을 왓드라나. 극중에 풍속에 嫌疑点이 잇드라고. 그래서 관중의 一人 某氏가 이러나서 「여보 그것은 風俗妨害오」하고 야지를 하얏것다. 임석하얏든 警官(그도 警部)某가 칼자루를 집고 벌덕 이러셔드니 「여보 그대는 그럴 말할 권리가 업소. 경관이 여기 잇는데 경관이 의례로 아러 할 터인데」하고 경관이 주의치 안은 것을 아모 권리업는 관중이 한다고 톡톡이 꾸짓드라나. 그래서 야지하든 이는「여보- 이보다 더-한 帝國議會場에서도 야지를 한다오. 경관만 야지하고 관중은 못한다는 법-어대 잇소」하고 대항을 하닛가 그는 엇지나 골이 낫든지 그 잇튼날 경관의 권리 橫侵 경관의 훈계 불복의 명으로 호출을 하얏드라고 어느 令이라 감히 안갈 수 업서서 가닛가 업는 위엄을 强作하면서 「그런 법이 어대잇느냐 완강한 자식」하고 사무상을 치는 꼴이야 하도 기가 막켜서 우스면서 「그대는 너우도 몰상식하니 서장께 質正하자」고 서장실에 뛰어드러가 先後를 말하닛가 서장도 어이가 업든지 비죽이 우스며 나아가라고 하드라나. 腰折 抱腹.

守錢奴의 末路는

碧潼碧團의 崔鵬鶴이라는 자는 돈을 꽤 만히 웅켜쥐고 살다가 지난번 독립군의 총알을 먹고 죽엇다나. 돈 가지고 산다고 다- 죽이랴 만은 그 자는 엇지나 守錢奴인지 떡 돈 한푼을 쓰지 안는데 학교니 강습이니 하야 공공사업을 말하면 열번 백번 만에 딱 一圓을 내들기가 상수이고 독립군이 오면 열번 백번 피하다가 급기야 만나게되면 내일오라 모레 오라하야 열번 백번 속이다가 뵌 주머니에 假物을 녀어주며 가지고 가서 펴 보라한다. 급기야 가서 펴본즉 종희나 헌겁뭉치 속에 一圓자리 한 장을 딱 끼엿다고. 그래서 그들은 참다 못하야 한알 보내섯다고. 그리하야 그의 가족은 離散되고 집은 텅븨엿다나. 그런데
昌城田倉에도 이따위 錢鬼 康興國이란 자가 살다가 금년 봄에 碧潼奴와 꼭 갓흔 형식으로 죽엇다고 碧潼 昌城에는 한 이약이 거리가 되야 人人家家에 전하더라.

江邊何是 雪城多
六月降雪以作城趾라 하야 彼地에 城을 築하다가 此地로 移하얏다 하야 吾郡을 雪城이라 함은 楚山도 然 碧潼도 然 昌城도 然 朔州도 亦然이라. 天은 抑何心志로 六月降雪인지. 祥事인가 亡事인지 城趾를 奠하야 郡邑을 정하얏다고 好意로 자랑하지만 정말 六月降雪은 不祥事.＜101＞
