The Value of Writing is Not Less Than the Value of Rice

One, Literacy Campaign (文盲打破運動)
According to what I hear from Russia (露西亞), there is something called a Literacy Campaign (文盲打破運動) in Russia. That movement truly seems like a humanitarian movement. What is its method? For example, speaking in terms of Chosŏn (朝鮮), suppose there is a village where one hundred people live, and among those hundred people, fifty-eight know letters and fifty-eight do not know letters. The method is that the fifty-eight who do not know letters set aside three hours from their labor time, and during that time, they are taught letters; this is called the Literacy Campaign. As a result, it is said that the farmers of Russia now almost all know letters. What a marvelous method, isn't it? How would it be if we could enlighten the knowledge of farmers in our Chosŏn using a method like this? However, this is something that cannot be done in our Chosŏn where circumstances are different. Instead, knowledgeable people throughout the country should rise up together and start a Farmer Knowledge Enlightenment Movement using another similar method. The specific method will be discussed in Kaebyŏk Magazine (開闢雜誌) in the future, so readers, please wait for now.

Two, The Art of Shrinking Heaven, Shrinking Earth, Shrinking Time, and Communicating with Spirits (縮天, 縮地, 縮時, 通神術)
If one thinks about it from a certain perspective, it is not an exaggeration to say that people live for enjoyment in everything. Eating, dressing, working, and sleeping can, in a broad sense, be seen as innate pleasures. While baseball, tennis, soccer, gambling, Go (圍棋), drinking contests, etc., are obviously done for enjoyment, indeed, all human activities can be interpreted as enjoyment. <1> However, the matter of enjoyment I wish to recommend to you all is not the trivial enjoyments mentioned above, but a method to obtain magnificent enjoyment like shrinking heaven (縮天), shrinking earth (縮地), shrinking time (縮時), and communicating with spirits (通神), if only one forms a habit. What is it? It is the enjoyment of reading (讀書). Books (書) are precisely the art of shrinking heaven and earth (縮天地) and the art of communicating with spirits (通神靈). When reading astronomy, the stars (星辰) millions of miles away shine before my eyes; this is the art of shrinking heaven (縮天術). When encountering geography, without stepping one foot outside the gate (不出門外一步地), ten thousand *li* of mountains and rivers are clearly visible before one's eyes (眼前에 歷然하나니); this is the art of shrinking earth (縮地術). When reading spiritual books such as religion, philosophy, etc., it feels as though the spirits of all ages, past and present, heaven and earth, all directions, and the three thousand great worlds descend upon me; this is precisely what is called the art of communicating with spirits (通神術). A person who knows such enjoyment is truly worthy of being called human, and a people who know such enjoyment are truly worthy of being called a people (民族). However, this is truly not an easy task. It is even less easy among the masses (民衆的). To obtain enjoyment among the masses, however, it cannot be done unless illiteracy is first overcome, like in Russia. But why are there few even among those who know letters who know such enjoyment? This is because they do not yet know spiritual enjoyment. That is, they have not formed the habit of reading. From now on, we must cast aside base enjoyments and cultivate the new habit of reading to obtain noble enjoyment.

Three, Method to Obtain Doctoral-Level Common Sense for Fifty Chŏn a Month (一個月 五十錢으로 博士的 常識을 엇는 方法)
There is a method to not only enter into the enjoyment of the art of shrinking heaven, shrinking earth, shrinking time, and communicating with spirits by paying a monthly fee of fifty chŏn (五十錢) per month, but also to concurrently obtain doctoral-level knowledge (博士的 學識). This can be achieved by continuously reading a magazine priced at fifty chŏn each month. There is a saying among the knowledgeable that there is no one who cannot become a doctor if they read just ten volumes of magazines; this expresses precisely that meaning. However, there are many people in our Chosŏn who save fifty chŏn and do not read magazines. In reality, it is not that they are saving the fifty chŏn, but rather that they do not know how to utilize it. <2> Even a person living the life of a beggar (乞食生活) would likely spend fifty chŏn in a month, but the way they spend it is either good or bad. Some people spend it on alcohol, some spend it on gambling, others spend it on snacks (군입질), and some even spend it on the amusements of kisaeng (妓生) or prostitutes (갈보). They do not feel regret for money spent so wastefully, but they are stingy (吝惜) with the fifty chŏn for a magazine that provides actual knowledge. The reason is that the former has become a habit, while the latter has not. Therefore, if one wishes to become an avid reader of magazines, decisive action (斷行) and resolution (決心) are paramount. What decisive action? Close your eyes and send the magazine fee for half a year or a full year in advance (先金). If not, cultivate the habit of sending it monthly. If you only have that resolution, becoming a doctor will happen naturally.

Four, A Major Reason Why Magazine Management is Difficult in Chosŏn Society (朝鮮社會의 雜誌經營이 困難한 一大原因)
Looking at the facts over the four or five years since the clamor to build a new culture began, although there have been several dozen types of magazines, we see the unfortunate situation where not a single one could continue for even a year and ended up suspending publication. Where does the fault lie? While the managers (經營者) bear responsibility, if one considers the reality carefully, the readers' responsibility accounts for nine out of ten cases. What responsibility do readers have? It is the responsibility of reading the text but not paying the text fee (글갑). Chosŏn people know well how to pay for drinks when they drink alcohol and how to pay for prostitutes when they see them, but they do not know how to pay the text fee after reading a book (冊). This is because they do not recognize the value of writing (글) even as much as alcohol or prostitutes. The example of the rustic person (野人) saying, "There are people who come to borrow rice, but none who come to borrow writing," and thus not educating their children (子弟), is a general malady (病弊) of Chosŏn people becoming illiterate. Therefore, isn't it natural that magazine management is difficult? If we compare and contrast this with the hundreds and thousands (幾百幾千) of magazine types currently in Japan (日本) and their sales figures (發賣部數) of hundreds of thousands or millions of copies, how does it truly look? <3> It is truly a long road ahead (前途遼遠한).

The Kaebyŏk Company (開闢社) has made the decisive decision to strictly implement a prepayment system (先金制) starting next month. We are concerned that without enforcing this, the institution that allows you all to become doctors may not be maintained forever. From the perspective of each individual reader (讀者便), it may seem like just one person, but from the perspective of the Company itself, which has over ten thousand readers, even if ten thousand members delay one month's payment, it immediately incurs a loss (損害) of five or six thousand *wŏn* (五六千圓). The presence or absence of that five or six thousand *wŏn* determines the existence or abolition (存廢) of that institution. We ask that you all deeply consider (高諒) these circumstances and, as if you were suffering a loss (損害밧듯이), send your prepayments starting next month (來月). To make the remittance method (送金方法) extremely convenient, a postal transfer form (振替口座用紙) is attached on a separate sheet. We ask not only individual readers but also everyone at the branch offices (支社) to first make great efforts regarding the prepayment system.

Five, Points for Readers within the Jurisdiction of Branch Offices, Branch Companies, Branch Bureaus, and Distribution Points to Note (支社 分社 分局 分賣所 管內讀者의 注意할 點)
This time, the prepayment system is not only being implemented for individual readers but it has also been decided that book/magazine shipments (送本) to branch offices (支社), branch companies (分社), branch bureaus (分局), and distribution points (分賣所) in various locations will be stopped if payment is not made in advance. Should a branch office... fail to implement the prepayment system, readers within its jurisdiction might, without reason, be unable to receive the magazine. Therefore, if the current month's magazine does not arrive when expected, please assume that, as usual (依例), the head office has stopped shipment to the branch office. If you have already made a prepayment to the branch office before then, please attach proof (證明) from the branch office and request the magazines corresponding (該當한) to the prepayment from the head office. If you have not made a prepayment, we earnestly (간졀이) request that you send the money directly to the head office's postal transfer account, Kyŏngsŏng (京城) 8106, according to the prepayment regulations (先金規定), and request the magazine.

Prepayment Regulations (先金規定)
Kaebyŏk (開闢) Price including postage (代金郵稅 並): One volume (一冊) 52 chŏn (五十二錢), Three volumes (三冊) 1 wŏn 52 chŏn (一圓 五十二錢), Six volumes (六冊) 3 wŏn 2 chŏn (三圓 二錢), Twelve volumes (十二冊) 6 wŏn 4 chŏn (六圓 四錢)

**Summary**

This editorial from the August 1923 issue of *Kaebyŏk* magazine serves as both a cultural commentary and a business announcement. It begins by praising Russia's literacy campaign, lamenting the lack of a similar initiative in Chosŏn, and promising future discussion on the topic. The author then extols the virtues of reading, elevating it beyond mere hobby to a "spiritual" practice capable of expanding one's perception of space, time, and knowledge, likening it to mystical arts. Reading magazines, specifically, is promoted as an affordable way (50 *chŏn* per month) to gain "doctoral-level" knowledge. The core issue addressed is the financial unsustainability of Chosŏn's magazine industry, blamed primarily on readers failing to pay for subscriptions ("text fee"), contrasting this sharply with the thriving Japanese magazine market. Consequently, the editorial announces a mandatory prepayment (先金制) system for *Kaebyŏk* and its sister publications (*Puin*, *Ŏrini*) starting the following month, providing detailed instructions and pricing, arguing this is necessary for the survival of these "institutions" of knowledge. From a historical perspective, the article vividly illustrates the push for literacy and enlightenment during the colonial period, the severe economic challenges faced by Korean cultural enterprises, the awareness (and perhaps envy) of developments in Russia and Japan, and the attempt to instill a sense of value for intellectual products among the Korean readership, framing subscription payment as a vital contribution to national cultural development. Historians might find the direct comparison with Russia's literacy efforts, the explicit link between reading and national progress, and the frank discussion of the financial realities of publishing under colonialism particularly insightful.
