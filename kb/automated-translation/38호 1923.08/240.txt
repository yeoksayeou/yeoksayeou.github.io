Ulsan Manch'o (Random Jottings on Ulsan)

Ulsan seen geographically. It is said to be a strategic point in the Left and Right Provinces (Kyŏngsang Provinces), being the easternmost region of Kyŏngnam (South Kyŏngsang). To the northwest, it borders Ch'ŏngdo, Kyŏngju in Kyŏngbuk (North Kyŏngsang Province), and Miryang, Yangsan in Kyŏngnam; to the south, it borders Tongnae County. To the east, it faces the blue sea, with Ulsan Bay in the center. The coastline has numerous inlets, making fish abundant. Like strung pearls, the Tongdae Mountains, Namam Mountains, and the great mountains of Pulgwang Taewun unfold towards the southeast and flow into the East Sea. Further to the northwest rise the great mountains of Ch'wisul, Kop'ye, Unmun, Kanwŏl, Wŏnjŏk, and Ch'wich'ŏp, which form natural boundaries with the surrounding counties. These are all part of the great forest zone known as the "Inexhaustible Treasure House of Southern Korea." The fertile plains along the three rivers—T'aehwa River, Ŏryŏn Stream, and Hoeya River—are not only among the province's foremost agricultural areas, but the climate of this region is also relatively mild due to ocean currents, making it very suitable for the propagation of crops and other plants. Thus, it is said that there are considerable benefits not only industrially but also hygienically.

History of Ulsan. In ancient times, this region was famous as a militarily important area due to the invasions of the Waegu (Japanese pirates). The current Pyŏngyŏng (Military Barracks) in Hasang-myŏn is its old site. The old Suyŏng (Naval Barracks) was located in Sejukp'o, Taehyŏn-myŏn, but during the reign of King Sŏnjo of the Yi Dynasty, the barracks were moved to Nam-myŏn in Tongnae County. Yŏmp'o in Tong-myŏn was also a garrison site where a Sugun Manho (Naval Commander) was stationed. The existing stone fortress is a relic from that time. Along with Kogwan in Pusanp'o and Chep'o in Ungch'ŏn-myŏn, Ch'angwŏn County, it was one of the Samp'o (Three Ports) of Chosŏn, serving as a trading port for reciprocal trade with mainland Japan. However, due to the great disturbance at Chep'o in the Kyŏngo year (1510), all Japanese residents withdrew to Taemado (Tsushima Island), and the post of Manho was eventually abolished.

Development of the town. Ulsan-ŭp (Ulsan Town), with a population of 6,000, is the only commercial and industrial center in the entire county. There are several daily automobile services connecting it with Pusan, which is 16 Japanese *ri* (approx. 63 km) away. Furthermore, since the Chungang Light Railway was constructed towards Kyŏngju and Taegu, there are three round trips daily, providing great convenience for both transportation and shipping. Within the city, telephones are installed (a company is being organized with ₩20,000 in stock to provide electricity), and notably, the Youth Hall, crystallized from the sincere efforts (lit. sincere blood) of Ulsan's youth, stands majestically, soaring high into the blue sky, seemingly watching over the city. This, more than anything, provides an exquisite pleasure. Thus, the prosperity of the town increases day by day. Pyŏngyŏng, only 28 *chō* (approx. 3 km) from the town center, <113> accommodates a population of 4,200 and is developing considerably as a commercial center. Ŏnyang, with a population of 2,300, is the former seat of Ŏnyang County. It is located 5 Japanese *ri* (approx. 20 km) from Ulsan, 2.5 *ri* (approx. 10 km) from T'ongdosa Temple, and 8 *ri* (approx. 31 km) from Mulgŭm on the Kyŏngbu railway line, serving as a central collection and distribution point, all connected by automobile services. It is also renowned as a rice-producing region.

Pangŏjin is the Southern Treasure House. There is a saying, "To know Ulsan, you must see Pangŏjin." This Southern Treasure House, Pangŏjin, is a natural harbor on the eastern cape of Ulsan Bay. Its north, east, and west sides are surrounded by hills, while the south faces the open sea. At the mouth of the bay lies a scenic islet called Sŏl Island (commonly known as Namakkosima - 나마꼬시마), which protects against rough waves. The harbor is deep, allowing ships to enter and exit freely, making it one of the foremost refuge and fishing ports on the East Coast. Recently, catches of mackerel, Spanish mackerel, and other fish are all gathered here, yielding an enormous annual production value of ₩3,000,000. During the peak fishing season each year, the number of vessels at sea exceeds 1,500, and the number of people surpasses 30,000. With the revision of customs duties, the port became a Designated Port. Starting this year, a five-year project is underway to construct breakwaters with a total budget of over ₩700,000. Within the harbor reside an equal number of Koreans (1,800) and Japanese (1,800). The town has complete facilities including electricity and telephones. By land, it is connected by automobile service, 6 *ri* (approx. 24 km) from Ulsan and 22 *ri* (approx. 86 km) from Pusan. By sea, it is 38 *ri* (approx. 149 km) from Pusan via Japanese shipping lines.

Changsaengp'o, Korea's Premier Whaling Port. Located in the middle of Ulsan Bay, it is the only major port between Pusan and Wŏnsan. By land, it is 2.5 *ri* (approx. 10 km) from Ulsan; by sea, 30 *ri* (approx. 118 km) from Pusan. The width of the bay mouth is only 1.5 *ri* (approx. 6 km), but like Pangŏjin, it is deep and a good bay protected from rough waves, allowing ships to enter and exit freely. Here lies the Chosŏn branch of the Tōyō Hogei Kaisha (Oriental Whaling Company), managed by Japanese. From the nearby seas, they achieve enormous profits of about ₩300,000 annually from whaling, catching between 50 and over 100 whales per year (average price per whale: ₩2,983). This port also became a Designated Port with the revision of customs duties, and there is a Japanese steamship line connecting it with Pusan.

The Daewoon Mountain Incident, which failed to resolve the people's resentment. This matter has been a pending issue disputed between Japan and Korea for many years, and moreover, it is a major incident where the resentment of the local Korean people fills the sky. As is already known to the world, this mountain spans across Onyang and Sŏsan townships of Ulsan County, a vast forested mountain covering 1,177 *chō* (町), 5 *tan* (段), 2 *myo* (畝) (approx. 11.67 sq km). <114> Over ten years ago, a Japanese man named Hayakawa Chōkichi (早川長計), under the pretext of afforestation, managed to obtain a lease permit. Since then, deceiving the authorities, his excessive logging became severe. Due perhaps to the earnest campaigning of the local residents after the Manse Movement of the Kimi year (1919), Hayakawa eventually had his permit revoked. However, by March 3rd of the following year, a Japanese man named Fujii Yoichi Uemon (藤井與一右衛門), registered in Fukuoka City, Hiroshima Prefecture, colluded with the then head of general affairs at the Ulsan County Office, a man named Ikeda (池田). Using the same methods, Fujii maneuvered to get a permit for the land designated as Class 1 Non-Preservation Forest, for a period of 12 years until February of Taishō 21 (1932), without any lease fee. After succeeding, he even deployed so-called forest protection police, preventing local residents from accessing even a blade of grass for fodder or firewood (蒭牧用 柴草). The people's resentment, reaching to the ¾¹ heavens, began to boil even more intensely than during Hayakawa's time. For several years, they worked behind the scenes (裏頭纏足), running east and west, submitting petitions and appeals. Perhaps moved by their earnest pleas and entreaties, the Provincial authorities summoned Fujii for admonishment (說諭), and it is said the protection police will eventually be withdrawn before long. Furthermore, the County authorities, making a grand gesture, announced that the remaining 60-odd *chōbu* (町步) outside the leased land would be permitted for ownership by Nam-myŏn, where the land is located. However, the Township authorities reportedly declined, stating that this designated forest was 100 or even 200 Korean *ri* away, making firewood collection completely impossible. Since the soil of this mountain is clay loam (埴質壤土), the pine and oak trees covering it have received nature's bounty directly over thousands of years, making afforestation entirely unnecessary. How heartbreaking must it be for the local residents who are deprived of the natural benefits of fodder and firewood? Ah, are they the only ones who give away the stomach but cannot even borrow the innards? And is the Daewoon Mountain incident the only one of its kind?

Korea's Manrisŏng (Ten Thousand Ri Wall). This fortress is a gateway fortress located on the border between Kyŏngbuk and Kyŏngnam provinces. It is said that this is the fortress constructed in Mobal County (毛伐郡, present-day Oedong-myŏn, Kyŏngju County) during the reign of King Sŏngdŏk of Silla. It blocks the Kusilgok (仇拾谷) valley and runs along the peaks to the east and west. Its circumference is 6,770 *ch'ŏk* (尺, approx. 2.1 km), making it a relic that holds the record for the longest wall in this region.

Two castle sites where heroes' blood and tears have not dried. Chŭngsŏng (甑城, Steamer Fortress, the current Ulsan Castle site), located south of Haksŏng Mountain (鶴城山), 15 *chō* (approx. 1.6 km) east of the Ulsan main town, was built after the Imjin War (壬亂). In December of the following year, the Japanese generals Katō Kiyomasa (加藤淸正), Ōta Kazuyoshi (太田一吉), and Asano Yukinaga (淺野幸長), attacked by the allied Korean-Ming forces (韓明聯合軍), retreated to this area. They demolished the original Ulsan fortress and used its stones to build a new castle on this mountain peak (山筆峈), naming it Chŭngsŏng. Below this mountain is a small bridge called Kkurŏngdari (꾸렁다리, Corpse Odor Bridge - 尸臭橋). During the Imjin War, there was a strong man known as General Yi (李將軍) among the villagers. Seeing the Japanese commanders advancing like an angry tide (怒潮), he picked up the ploughshare (보섭) he was using for farming, charged straight into the enemy lines, <115> took thousands of heads, and filled the space under this bridge with them. For several years afterward, the rotten stench (腥臭) assaulted the noses of passersby, hence the bridge's name, Kkurŏngdari. General Yi's tomb is below this mountain, and his descendants continue ancestral rites (香火) to this day. At that time, the Japanese soldiers were besieged by the Korean-Ming assault troops. After being trapped in the castle for over ten days, their water and supply routes were cut off. Hunger and thirst reached extreme levels; they chewed paper scraps and wall plaster. When they could no longer get horse blood, they finally resorted to squeezing horse dung for liquid, begging for survival by any means. This tragic scene is still talked about today. Furthermore, near the base of this mountain, there is a special settlement of people engaged in butchery and other lowly occupations. This settlement consists of descendants of surrendered Japanese soldiers (降倭), and one can still hear Japanese intonations in their speech. This Chŭngsŏng castle site was owned by Mr. Kim T'aekch'ŏn (金澤天) of this area. Years ago, upon the request of the Sŏngjihoe (Castle Site Association), an organization jointly formed by Japanese and Koreans, he donated the entire site except for one section on the eastern foot to the association, and it was opened as a simulated small park.

Furthermore, 6 *ri* (approx. 2.4 km) south of the Ulsan main town, on the coast of Sŏsaeng-myŏn, lies the Sŏsaengsŏng (西生城) castle site. This too was newly built by Katō Kiyomasa. After losing Ulsan Castle once, he retreated to this fortress. Before long (未幾), he was again subjected to close combat (肉薄) by the Korean-Ming forces, suffered a crushing defeat, and barely escaped with a few remaining soldiers (殘騎). This castle was called an "Ikja-sŏng" (翼字城, Wing-shaped Fortress). Its construction was said to be so irregular and winding (參差屈曲) that even a flying bird, once entering through a gate, would lose its freedom to advance or retreat – a supposedly impregnable "demon-subduing fortress" (伏魔城). However, it was a lonely castle at sunset (孤城落日); what could be done when fortune had turned (運去需轟)? The stone walls of its watchtowers (城櫓) and ramparts (廊塀) seem instead to guard the heroic spirits of the righteous martyrs of Ch'angp'yodang (蒼表堂), still shedding blood and sweat in the ancient dust and cold wind. Is this all there is to it? Yet, even in today's overturned world, for them to claim these two castle sites as monuments commemorating Katō's victories, attempting to baptize the dirty face of these sites with distorted writing and strange arguments (曲筆怪論), <116> is indeed laughable material for onlookers. Let us now trace back and read the Kyŏngju Sŏnsaeng'an (Record of Kyŏngju Officials/Events). The feelings of past and present are likely to stir excitement once more.

On the 13th day of the 4th month of the Imjin year (1592), Japanese ships came from Tsushima Island, covering the sea. On the 14th, Pusan fell. On the 16th, Tongnae fell consecutively. From here, the fierce bandits took advantage of their victories, advancing rapidly, dividing their routes and proceeding simultaneously. Magistrate Yun In-t'ong (尹仁通), hearing the news that Tongnae and other major garrisons had fallen, had Chipkyŏngjŏn (集慶殿) attendants Chŏng Sa-sŏng (鄭士誠) and Hong Yŏ-yul (洪汝栗) respectfully transport the Royal Portrait (御容) to inner regions like Andong (安東) and Yean (禮安). As for the ancestral tablets (位牌) of the sage Confucius and various worthies in the Munmyo (文廟, Confucian Shrine), eight students including Mun Ŭng-sŏng (文應星) carried them respectfully and hid them deep in the mountains. By the 20th, the fierce bandits had already pressed close to this Prefecture (Kyŏngju). The Magistrate, under the pretext of pursuing escaped generals, had already left the fortress and subsequently retreated north. The defending general, Prefecture Judge Pak Ŭi-jang (朴毅長), along with Changgi County Magistrate Yi Su-il (李守一), led troops to engage the enemy. The enemy's spirit was fierce (䲭張), while our forces disintegrated like tiles. Unable to match them, they were defeated,溃败, and scattered. Afterward, the Magistrate and Judge did not leave the prefecture's borders but moved between Kigye (杞溪) and Chukchang (竹長), gathering scattered soldiers and raising a righteous army (倡義起兵). The bandits occupying the fortress frequently came out to burn and plunder, but they intercepted and captured/killed them (遏截捕斬), somewhat suppressing their oppressive momentum (憑凌之氣). The Provincial Army Commander (兵使) Yi Kak (李珏) abandoned his camp and fled in defeat. Miryang Governor (府使) Pak Chin (朴晋) replaced him as Army Commander. At that time, the bandit horde had already crossed Choryŏng Pass (鳥嶺), their power and influence scorching the heavens (勢焰薰天), advancing unopposed wherever they went. The Army Commander recruited and led a number of soldiers. Hearing that the county magistrates were capturing Japanese soldiers, he pierced through the bandit-infested territory (穿貫賊藪), traveling day and night to arrive. He discussed military affairs with the two county magistrates and established fortifications. The army's reputation gradually grew. On the 21st day of the 8th month, the Army Commander mobilized over 50,000 troops from sixteen administrative units and advanced to attack the bandits occupying the fortress. Unfortunately, they were surrounded by Japanese reinforcements coming up from Pusan and retreated unsuccessfully. The Army Commander, leading his officers and soldiers, remained stationed in counties like An'gang (安康) and Kigye (杞溪), gathering scattered troops. By day, they charged (馳突) towards the fortress walls; by night, they lined up fires on the peaks or fired cannons into the fortress. Many bandits were struck by Ch'ŏnnoe (天雷, 'Heavenly Thunder' bombs) and died scorched. They gathered heads, shouting and panicking, losing their wits (驚惶遞魄). On the night of the 8th day of the 9th month, they fled towards Pusan. Public offices and government buildings (公廨官宇) were all reduced to ashes. What remained were Pinhyŏnnu Pavilion (賓賢樓) and two granaries. There was a great deal of grain left in the granaries, which sustained the military and civilian population of the entire region and neighboring counties. On the day the bandits retreated, Judge Pak Ŭi-jang led troops into the fortress. He selected elite soldiers (抄送精兵) and sent them to the Ŏnyang and Ulsan routes daily to intercept (遏截) bandits intruding from Ulsan. Consequently, the Japanese coming up from Pusan dared not clash again. The routes to Yŏngch'ŏn (永川) and Sinnyŏng (新寧) were opened up from this point. On a day in the 3rd month of the Kyesa year (1593), Judge Pak Ŭi-jang led troops in ambush at P'ajŏmhyŏn Pass (巴岑峴) near Taegu (大丘). Encountering several thousand enemy troops, they attacked stealthily and won a great victory. The Provincial Governor (巡察使) reported this, recommending commendation (襃啓), and Pak was specially promoted to the rank of T'ongjŏng (通政) and became Magistrate (府尹). The previous Magistrate, being a civil official, was replaced and returned. Ming generals Wu Weizhong (吳惟忠) and Luo Shangzhong (駱尙忠) led 5,000 troops and stationed them in this <117> Prefecture in the autumn of the Kyesa year. They withdrew at the end of the year. In the 9th month of the Chŏngyu year (1597), bandits like Kiyomasa, occupying the border areas, again unleashed their scorpion-like venom (再肆蠆毒), running rampant (縱橫陸梁) through Chŏlla and Ch'ungch'ŏng provinces. On their way back down through the Left Province (Kyŏngsang) after reaching Chiksan, the cruelty of their killing and plundering was even worse than before. The remaining government buildings in this Prefecture and Punhwangsa Temple (芬皇寺), founded in the Silla era, along with the 300,000 *kŭn* (斤, approx. 180 tons) cast golden Buddha, were all burned without remainder. The nine-story ancient pagoda was also completely destroyed. After staying for five days, they returned down to Ulsan, built fortifications at Tosan (島山 - Japanese name for the Ulsan Castle site), and defended them resolutely. On the 22nd day of the 12th month of the same year, the Celestial General (天將), Commissioner (經理御史) Yang Hao (楊鎬), and Commander-in-Chief (提督) Ma Gui (麻貴), leading over 50,000 troops, advanced directly on Tosan. They captured the outer fortifications (拔砊�外壘 - character 砊� likely 碎 'break' or similar), beheaded over 1,000 bandits, and besieged the fortress for over ten days. Firewood gathering and water drawing (樵汲) were long cut off, and the enemy's situation was already desperate, nearly wiped out (庶幾掃滅). Unfortunately, due to sudden rain and extreme cold (天雨暴寒), the troops and horses became exhausted and haggard (困悴). Japanese reinforcements (繼援) arrived daily from Pusan, so the siege was lifted, and they retreated. In the following year, Musul (1598), on the 21st day of the 9th month, Commander-in-Chief Ma Gui led 30,000 troops and advanced again towards Ulsan. Advancing and retreating, they pressed close to the fortress, hoping for a decisive battle. On the 20th day of the 11th month of the same year, the bandits stationed consecutively over 900 *ri* from this province to Honam, east and west, simultaneously burned their shelters/barracks (焚棚) and all fled back to their country. Generally, this prefecture (Kyŏngju) is the ancient capital of Silla (新羅). Ancient traditions and traceable historical sites were mostly lost in the flames of war. What remains today are only the Provincial Gazetteer (本道地理誌), Continued Gazetteer (續地理誌), Record of Provincial Officials (營主先生案), Record of Magistrates and Judges (府尹判官先生案), Genealogy of the Silla Founding Ancestor (新羅始祖世系譜), and a few others. During that urgent crisis, the elderly clerk Ch'oe Nak (崔洛) took these precious records, dug a pit (堀坎深埋), and buried them deep. After the bandits retreated, he moved them to a secluded mountain temple (幽僻山寺), ultimately saving them from the fierce flames (烈焰), allowing them to be transmitted to later generations to connect the traces of history and change from ancient times to the present. Is this not indeed fortunate? Thus, it is recorded. Recorded by Ch'oe Nak.

The above Sŏnsaeng'an (先生案) has many points connected to the Ulsan article, so it has been specially appended in its entirety. Esteemed readers, please understand and excuse this. - Ŭl-in (乙人), while passing through Haksŏng (鶴城 - Ulsan) in the 7th month of autumn, Kyesa year (1917 or 1857 - likely mistake, context suggests 1923 corresponds to Kyehae 癸亥, not Kyesa 癸巳. However, Kyesa is written.)

Remnants of Superstition
One evening in Ulsan town, after dinner, I went out for a stroll (灑風次). I saw an old woman leading a young girl. The girl held the lid of a bowl (바리뚝겅 - barittukkŏng) in her left hand. As they drummed on it, she loudly chanted, "Another family's daughter-in-law sleeps by day and works by night!" I immediately asked the local people about this. It is something done by a family where someone has malaria (瘧疾病), specifically the type with daily fever cycles (日瘧). The method involves taking a gourd dipper (박아치 - pagaji), going around to three houses with different surnames to beg for rice. Then, one takes a loom reed (바듸 - padi) and a fine-toothed comb (참빗 - ch'ambit), binds them with hemp rope (삼노끈 - samnokkŭn), puts a wooden match (목성냥 - moksŏngnyang) into the bowl, and after dusk (黃昏), leaves it at a crossroads or under a bridge. After reciting some incantation (呪言) for a while, they burn it and return home. However, the drumming on the bowl lid (食盖) and chanting only occurs while walking from the gate to the desired location. <118>

**Summary**

This 1923 travelogue provides a multifaceted description of Ulsan and its surrounding region. It covers Ulsan's geography, strategic importance, history (including Japanese pirate raids, the Imjin War, and the Three Ports trade), early 20th-century development (population, transport like railways and cars, infrastructure like telephone), major ports like the fishing hub Pangŏjin and the whaling center Changsaengp'o (dominated by a Japanese company), and historical sites like Manrisŏng, Chŭngsŏng (Ulsan Castle site), and Sŏsaengsŏng, recounting Imjin War events and local legends. A significant portion details the contentious Daewoon Mountain incident, where local Koreans disputed Japanese forestry leases, highlighting land-use conflicts and grievances. The article appends the *Kyŏngju Sŏnsaeng'an*, a detailed record of Kyŏngju during the Imjin War, and concludes with an observation of a local folk remedy for malaria. From a colonial history perspective, the article is revealing in its depiction of Japanese economic penetration (whaling, forestry, trade ports), the development of infrastructure potentially serving colonial interests, the explicit conflict over resources like the Daewoon Mountain forest fueled by Japanese exploitation and perceived collusion by officials, and the contrasting narratives surrounding historical sites related to Japanese invasions. Historians would find valuable the specific details on local economy (fishing/whaling figures), the Daewoon Mountain case study of colonial-era land disputes, the description of infrastructure development, the raw historical account provided by the *Kyŏngju Sŏnsaeng'an*, and the ethnographic note on folk beliefs.

蔚山漫草
지리상으로 본 蔚山. 慶南의 극동지방으로 左右道에서는 요충지대가 된다 한다. 서북방은 경북의 淸道, 慶州, 慶南의 密陽, 梁山 남은 東萊郡과 境을 접하얏고 동은 碧海에 面한 중앙에 蔚山灣이 잇서 연안각처에 灣曲이 다하야 魚物이 풍부하고 貫珠와 가티 서로 連亙하야 동남방으로 전개되야 동해로 유입하는 東大山脈, 南岩山脈, 佛光大雲의 여러 大山과 다시 서북방으로 聳立하야 四圍의 제군과 자연의 경계를 일운 鵄述, 高敝, 雲門, 間月, 圓寂, 鷲捷등의 여러 大山은 모다 南鮮의 無盡寶庫라는 대삼림의 지대가 되고 太和江, 語連川, 回夜江등 三川연안의 沃野는 도내 굴지의 농산지가 될 뿐 아니라 아울너 이 지방의 기후는 해류의 관계로 비교적 온화하야 농작물 기타 초목의 번식에 매우 적당함으로 하야 산업상은 물론 따라서 위생상으로 나의 稗益을 어듬이 적지안타고 한다.
蔚山의 연혁. 往昔의 이 지방은 倭寇의 침해로 하야 국방상 用武地로 유명하얏섯다. 지금 下廂面 兵營은 즉 그 舊蹟인데 舊水營은 大峴面 細竹浦에 잇섯든 것을 李朝 宣祖 당시에 그 영을 동래군 南面에 移置하얏든 일이 잇섯고 東面 鹽浦도 水軍 萬戶가 잇든 營地로 그 현존한 石城은 당시의 유적이니 즉 釜山浦의 古舘과 昌原郡 熊川面의 薺浦와 동시 朝鮮의 三浦로서 日本內地와 互市무역의 통상항이 되얏다가 庚午年 薺浦의 大變亂으로 하야 日本人의 전부가 對馬島로 撤歸한 후 맛츰내 萬戶가 폐지되얏다 한다.
읍내의 발전. 蔚山邑은 六千의 인구가 잇는 전군 중 유일의 상공업지로 相距 十六里(日本里數로)되는 釜山과의 日日 數回나 되는 자동차의 편이 잇고 다시 慶州와 大邱방면으로는 中央輕鐵이 부설된 후로 一日 三次의 왕복이 잇서 교통상에나 운수상에나에 지대한 利便을 圖得하는 외에 시내에는 전화(전등은 二萬圓의 주식으로 회사를 조직하는 중)의 가설이 잇고 더욱히 蔚山청년의 誠血이 엉기여 結晶된 청년회관은 장엄하게 靑空이 놉히 소사 市中을 감시하는 감이 잇슴은 이야말로 무엇보다 이상의 快味를 備嘗케한다. 이러케 시가의 번영은 日復日 속도를 가하야 온다. 읍내에서 불과 28町의 거리되는 兵營도＜113＞ 4,200의 인구를 수용하는 상업지로 상당히 발전되얏오는 중이오 彦陽은 인구 2,300이 잇는 元彦陽군청 소재지로서 蔚山서는 五里(日本里數), 通度寺서는 二里半, 경부선 勿禁서는 八里를 相距한 중앙집산지로 모다 자동차에 편이 잇고 또한 미곡의 산지로 일홈 놉흔 지방이라 한다.
方魚津은 南方富庫. 속담에 蔚山을 알랴거든 方魚津을 보라 하얏다. 이 南方富庫 方魚津은 항구는 蔚山灣 東岬의 天然港으로 동서북 삼면은 구릉으로써 둘너싸고 남방은 대해에 면하얏다. 灣口에는 瑟島(속칭 나마꼬시마)라 하는 風致的 小島가 잇서 풍랑을 保障하고 항내는 수심이 深長하야 선박의 출입이 자유롭게된 동해연안의 屈指하는 避難漁港이다. 近洋에는 鯖鰆 기타 어류의 산이 모다 이곳으로 집산하야 연 300만원이라는 엄청나는 産額을 어드며 매년 성어기에는 해상의 船隻 1,500 이상, 인원 3만 이상을 초과한다. 항구는 關稅개정과 동시에 指定港이 되야 本年度부터 五個年간 계속사업으로 총공비 70만원여의 巨資를 投하야 방파제를 축설하는 중이며 항내에는 朝鮮人 1,800, 日本人 1,800이 되는 균등수의 居民이 잇고 시내에는 전등, 전화의 완비한 시설과 육로로는 蔚山距 六里, 釜山距 二十二里의 자동차의 편이며 해상으로는 釜山距 三十八里되는 日航의 선편이 잇다.
朝鮮 一의 捕鯨港 長生浦. 蔚山灣내 중간에 잇는 釜山 元山간의 유일한 대항이다. 육로로는 蔚山距 二里半, 해로로는 釜山距 三十里가 된다. 灣口의 幅圓은 一里半에 불과하나 方魚津과 가티 수심이 深長하고 또 풍랑을 保障하는 良灣으로 선박의 출입이 자유롭다. 이곳에는 日本人의 경영 하에 잇는 東洋捕鯨會社의 朝鮮支店이 잇서 근해로부터 매년 捕鯨의 頭數 五十頭 내지 百餘頭의 가격(一頭 평균가격 2,983원) 약 30만원이 막대한 수익이 잇다. 이 항구도 또한 관세개정과 동시에 指定港이 되야 釜山과의 일항의 기선이 잇다.
만민의 원을 풀지 못한 大雲山 사건. 이 일로 말하면 다년 日鮮간에 係爭되는 현안으로 더구나 지방선민의 원성이 漲天한 대사건이다. 임의 세상에 들어난 바어니와 이 산은 蔚山郡 溫陽 西山 양면을 통하야 1,177町 五段 二畝나＜114＞ 되는 大森林山이다. 距今 十餘年전에 日本人 早川長計라는 자가 造林의 美名을 憑藉하고 대부허가를 圖得한 후부터는 관리를 愚弄하야 濫伐이 심한 所以와 己未年 萬歲後 지원민의 열심 운동한 결과로 早川은 맛츰내 허가취소를 당하얏든 바, 다시 그 翌年 3월3일까지 이르는 동안에 廣島縣 福岡市에 籍을 置한 日人 藤井與一右衛門이라는 자가 당시 蔚山군청 서무주임인 池田이란 자를 결탁하야 역시 동일한 수단으로 용도는 제일종 不要存林, 기간은 大正 21年 2月까지의 12個年으로 貸付料업시 허가를 운동하야 급기야 성공 후는 소위 산림보호警官까지 배치하야 地元民으로 하야금 蒭牧用 柴草까지 一毫를 接手치 못하게 하야 ¾¹天의 민원은 다시 早川 당시 이상으로 더욱더욱 끌어오루기 시작되야 수년을 두고 裏頭纏足으로 東奔西馳하야 혹은 진정 혹은 탄원으로 복걸애걸한 지성에 감동되얏든지 道當局은 일시 藤井을 호출 說諭하야 결국 보호순사는 不遠間 철폐하게 된다 한다. 그리고 郡當局은 다시 큰 생색으로 貸付地 외에 잔여한 부분 60餘町步를 소재지인 南面의 소유로 허가한다고 言한 일이 잇섯다. 그러나 面當局은 이 지정림의 거리가 朝鮮里數로 百里 혹 200리외에 隔離하야 柴草採取도 도저 불가능함으로 하야 도리여 謝絶하얏다 한다. 이 산의 토질은 埴質壤土임으로 하야 만산한 松樫등은 누천년을 지나는 동안에 천혜를 직접으로 밧아왓슬 뿐으로 다시 조림의 필요가 전무할 뿐 아니라 비룊�초, 柴草의 천혜를 蒙利치 못하게 된 地元民이야말로 그들의 가슴이 얼마나 쓰리랴 아- 배주고 속도 못빌어 먹는 자 엇지 이들만이며 大雲山 사건이 엇지 이뿐이랴.
朝鮮의 萬里城. 이 성은 경북경남의 분계선에 잇는 關門城인데 新羅 聖德王 시대에 毛伐郡(금 慶州郡 外東面) 성을 축조하얏다 함이 곳 이 성이다. 仇拾谷을 擁塞하야 동서의 山頂으로 走하얏는데 周回 6,770尺이나 되는 장성으로 이 지방으로서는 최고기록을 전하는 유물이라 한다.
영웅의 血淚가 말으지 못한 두 성지. 蔚山本府에서 동방으로 15町되는 鶴城山의 남에 잇는 甑城(금 蔚山城址)은 壬亂후 竪年 12月에 倭將 加藤淸正, 太田一吉, 淺野幸長등이 韓明聯合軍의 공격을 밧아 이 지방까지 退縮되야 蔚山본군을 毁破하고 그 城石으로 이 山筆峈 우에 新城을 移築하고 일홈을 甑城이라 하얏다 한다. 이 산하에는 꾸렁다리(尸臭橋)라는 小橋가 잇는데 壬亂당시 이 동리 거민중 소위 李將軍이란 力士가 잇서 怒潮와 가티 모라오는 倭長을 보고 耕田하든 보섭(犁)을 들어 적진을 直衝하야＜115＞ 수천의 首級을 취하야 이 다리 밋헤 塡沒한 후 수년을 지나도록 그 腥臭가 행인의 鼻를 亂觸함으로 이 다리 일홈을 꾸렁다리라 하얏다는데 이 산하에 이장군의 묘가 잇서 지금까지 후손의 香火가 끈이지 안는다 한다. 당시 倭兵은 韓明突擊隊의 포위를 당하야 이 산하에 籠城한지 十餘日에 산하의 水道와 糧道는 임의 遮斷되고 飢渴이 극에 달하야 紙片과 壁土를 咀嚼한다. 馬血을 취하다 못하야 마츰내 馬糞까지 搾하야서 즙을 취하야 만사일생을 구걸하든 참상이야말로 지금것 人口에 膾炙될 뿐 아니라 이 산하부근에는 屠漢, 기타 賤役에 종사하는 자들의 특수부락이 잇는데 이 부락은 당시 降倭족속으로 그 언어까지 아즉 倭音대로 發함을 볼 수가 잇다. 종래 이 甑城은 당지 金澤天氏의 소유로서 年前 日鮮人 공동의 조직단체인 城址會의 요청에 의하야 東麓一隔를 제한 외 전부 동회에 기여하야 模擬的 소공원으로 개방하얏다.
다시 蔚山본부에서 남으로 六里되는 西生面의 海濱에 西生城이라는 성지가 잇다. 이것도 加藤淸正의 신축한 성인데 일차 蔚山城을 失한 후 이 성으로 退守한지 未幾에 재차 韓明軍의 肉薄을 당하야 여지업시 참패되야 겨우 二三의 殘騎를 거늘리고 脫城亡命하얏다 한다. 이 성은 소위 翼字城으로 그 조작이 하도 參差屈曲하야 飛鳥라도 一次 一門으로 들어가기만 하면 진퇴의 자유를 失하는 萬夫不當의 伏魔城이라 하얏다. 그러나 孤城落日이라 運去需轟에 奈何오. 그 城櫓와 廊塀의 石垣등은 도리여 蒼表堂의 諸義士의 英魄을 호위하야 의연히 구진 비 찬바람에 피땀흘니는 듯 하다. 엇지 이랫슬 뿐이랴만은 임의 轉倒의 今日이라 하야 저들은 兩城址가 加藤氏의 戰捷記念物이라 하야 曲筆怪論으로써 이 성지의 더러운 얼골에＜116＞ 세례를 주어보랴함은 또한 구경군의 우슴거리가 될 만하다. 이제 慶州先生案을 溯閱하야보자. 今昔의 感이 다시금 흥분될 듯하다.

迷信의 남어지
나는 蔚山읍내서 하로는 저녁을 먹고 灑風次로 길거리에 나서서 그니노라니까 엇더한 늙은 여인 하나이 어린 女兒를 압세우고 女兒는 외인 편 손에 바리뚝겅 한 개를 들고 두다리면서 목소리를 놉히여 『남의 집 며느리 낫으로 잠자고 밤으로 일함네』라고 웨치는 것을 보고 곳 동리 사람들에게 물어보앗다. 이것은 瘧疾病 중에도 특히 日瘧에 걸닌 사람이 잇는 病家에서 행하는 일이라는데 그 方文은 박아치를 가지고 姓 다른 집 세 집을 도라 밥을 어더다가 바듸(織造用櫛) 나참빗(眞梳)을 삼노끈(麻繩)으로 감아서 목성냥(木硫黃) 한 개를 그 그릇에 너어서 해진 뒤(黃昏)에 네 길거리 우에나 다리아래 갓흔데 내버리고 무엇이라고 한참 동안 비는 말(呪言)이 잇슨 뒤에 불에 살나버리고 집으로 돌아온다는데 다만 食盖를 두다리면서 웨치는 소리는 문 밧글 나서 소원하는 장소까지 행하야 갈 때 뿐이라 한다.＜118＞
