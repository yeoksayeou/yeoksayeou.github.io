Article Title: 時調 (Sijo - Traditional Korean Poem)
Author: 李相定
Article Type: 시 (Poem)

The moon shining in the guest window pointlessly comes and goes,
Endless spring and autumn dreams regretlessly come and go.
Among these, is the only one I cannot see my beloved?

Floating a boat on the P'aegang River, going up Ch'ŏngnyubyŏk,
Modanbong Peak and Pubyŏngnu Pavilion's shadows dance in the midstream.
Ah, the scenic spot of Kwansŏ is P'yŏngyang on the river! <36>

**Summary**

This article presents two Sijo poems by Yi Sangjŏng. The first poem expresses a sense of longing and solitude, contrasting the constant movement of the moon and dreams with the absence of the beloved. The second poem depicts the scenic beauty of P'yŏngyang as viewed from the Taedong River (P'aegang), mentioning famous landmarks like Modanbong Peak and Pubyŏngnu Pavilion. For historians, these poems demonstrate the continuation of traditional Korean literary forms like the Sijo during the colonial period. The second poem's appreciation of a specific Korean landscape (P'yŏngyang) could be interpreted as a subtle assertion of Korean cultural identity and pride in the nation's heritage, published within a prominent intellectual journal of the time. The use of older Hangul orthography is also noteworthy.
