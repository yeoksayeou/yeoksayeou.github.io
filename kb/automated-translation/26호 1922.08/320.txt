Passing Spring, March
						Sowŏl

Passing spring, March, March is Samjil day
Even the swallows of Kangnam (江南) came, not forgetting.
Indeed, yes
Sorrowfully, at this time, unforgettably, I long.
Would you forget? Have you already, so soon?
The sound of the oriole calling its beloved.
The wind, wanting to cry, blows until dusk
Even in sorrow, at this time
Passing spring, March, March is Samjil day.<26>

**Summary**

This poem by Sowŏl captures the melancholic feeling associated with the end of spring, specifically March, coinciding with the traditional Samjinnal holiday. The speaker observes the return of swallows but feels a persistent, unforgettable sorrow and longing, questioning if a loved one has forgotten them. The sounds of nature, like the oriole's call and the mournful wind, mirror the speaker's internal state. From a historical perspective, the poem exemplifies the lyrical and often sorrowful tone ('han') common in Korean literature during the Japanese colonial period. While personal, the themes of longing, loss, and the passage of time against a backdrop of natural cycles could resonate with the broader national sentiment of loss and displacement felt under colonial rule. Historians might find Sowŏl's blending of traditional Korean elements (Samjinnal, folk imagery) with personal melancholy significant in understanding cultural expression during this era.
