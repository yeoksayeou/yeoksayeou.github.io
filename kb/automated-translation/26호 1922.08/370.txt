It is the long, long summer days. These are recent days when even a single layer of hemp cloth is unbearable on the body. On top of that, the drought and heat (旱炎) continue. The hardship (苦勞) and worry (憂慮) of our sweating comrades must be all the more severe (甚).

We, who have said we have a separate task entrusted to us and have strived to be true friends to our compatriots (同胞) solely through that entrusted task, said we would make an extra effort (一段의 努力) in this month's issue (本月號), but how did it actually turn out?

We personally think (自思) that translating and publishing (譯載) the masterpieces (名作) of various great writers (文豪) as a supplement (附錄) to this issue is meaningful (意義) in many ways. For you readers, too, it will likely be more pleasant (快) than reading rather unsatisfactory original works (創作品).

Summer is an unusual season (異常한 節) among the four seasons (4節). It demands shedding (灑脫) and liberation (解放) from everyone (萬人). We take off the clothes we wore and reveal the skin we hid. We seek the breeze by the clear river (淸江) and whistle in the green shade (綠陰). If it's good, it's a really good time. Let's try to spend it really well. Haha. <55>

**Summary**

This editorial postscript from the August 1922 issue of Kaebyŏk acknowledges the hardships of summer, including intense heat and drought, expressing sympathy for the readers. The editors reflect on their efforts for the current issue, specifically mentioning the inclusion of translated masterpieces by famous foreign authors as a supplement, suggesting this might be more enjoyable for readers than potentially less satisfactory contemporary Korean works. The piece concludes with musings on summer as a liberating season, encouraging readers to embrace its pleasant aspects. From a historical perspective, the text highlights the challenging living conditions (drought, heat) and offers insight into the cultural landscape, where translated foreign literature was presented as a significant offering, possibly reflecting the state of domestic literary production or editorial strategy during the colonial period. The mention of "liberation" (解放), even metaphorically about summer, is interesting given the political context.

餘言
長長 夏日이외다. 베옷 한 껍흘이 몸에 겨워서 못 견듸여 하는 近日이외다. 게다가 또 旱炎가 繼續합니다. 땀 흘리는 동무들의 苦勞와 憂慮가 一層 甚할 것이외다.

別로이 마튼 바가 잇서 오즉 그 마튼 바의 일에서 同胞의 眞實한 벗이 되어 오노라한 우리는 本月號에 잇서 一段의 努力을 더하노라 하엿사오나 事實 어찌되엇는지오.

本號의 附錄으로 特히 여러 文豪의 名作을 譯載한 것은 여러가지로 생각하야 意義가 잇는 일이라 自思합니다. 讀者 여러분으로도 돌이어 시원치 못한 刱作품을 닑는 것보다 快할 것이외다.

여름이란 4節 中에도 異常한 節이외다. 萬人에게 灑脫, 解放을 要求합니다. 입엇던 옷도 벗어 부터며 감추엇던 살도 들어 내입니다. 淸江에 바람을 찻고 綠陰에 휘파람을 불게 됩니다. 됴타면 썩 됴흔 때이지요. 썩 됴히 지내보기로 합시다. 呵呵.＜55＞
