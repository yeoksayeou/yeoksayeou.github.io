Social Diary
						One Reporter
1st
For a month, the drought was severe, the rice paddies cracked open, and the grass withered and dried up. But from the last day of June, a sweet rain (甘雨) came across thousands of *ri*, making the farmers dance with joy, and the mountains and fields took on a fresh hue. Kim Ik-sang in Nagasaki Prison, having had his first public trial (30th), is said to miss out on even tasting the sweet rain. In Ireland, the sounds of guns and spears are reportedly still unceasing.

3rd
The bandit group (馬賊團) in Tudugu is reportedly continuing its activities, making it very dangerous. The Tōkyō Metropolitan Police Agency's (東京警視廳) crackdown on Koreans (a secret society [秘密結社] said to be related to the Labor-Farmer Association [勞農會]) continues, and police officers have reportedly been dispatched urgently even to Shanghai (an incident from late last month). Heavy rain fell in Kyŏngsŏng, lightning struck along the Han River, and Pak Hŭng-gwan (32), a vegetable merchant in Ch'angsin-dong, reportedly committed suicide due to hardship. The police authorities issued a confiscation order (押收命令) for the July issue of *Kaebyŏk* on the 3rd, saying its contents were very frightening.

4th
As the 1,500 members of the bandit group in Kando reportedly coordinate, their activities are very dangerous, and the Hoeryŏng regiment dispatched the 75th Infantry Regiment. The Kyŏngsŏng Municipal Office announced plans to establish new cemeteries as the existing public cemeteries (共同墓地) (It'aewŏn, Sindang-ri) are full. The death and burial rates for this fullness, shown annually, are: 1918 (Taishō 7): 6,679 deaths, 5,442 burials; 1919 (Taishō 8): 9,447 deaths, 7,904 burials; 1920 (Taishō 9): 10,977 deaths, 5,817 burials; 1921 (Taishō 10): 7,433 deaths, 5,704 burials. The difference between deaths and burials is said to be due to private burials and re-interments. A major startling fact published in a certain newspaper on the 4th is that the annual cost of tears for Kyŏngsŏng's poor is 1 million Won. The details are that there are 106 Korean pawnshops (典當局) and 49 Japanese pawnshops in Kyŏngsŏng. The amount loaned to the poor by pawnshops last year was 607,400 Won from Korean shops and 491,000 Won from Japanese shops. Nine business groups in Kaesŏng reportedly held some major meeting for business purposes. Also, the Koryŏ Women's Hall (高麗女子舘) in Kaesŏng is reportedly experiencing great trouble after expelling 60 male students. In Europe, there was a clash between Germans and French troops (2nd) with many casualties. Over 50 American university students are reportedly campaigning to aid impoverished German university students (3rd). The war between the Free State and Republican armies in Ireland is reportedly still ongoing. According to a survey by the Communications Bureau's Savings Department, comparing the savings performance of Japanese and Koreans: Japanese: 238,210 people; Koreans: 1,100,869 people. Savings amount: Japanese: 17,059,423 Won; Koreans: 2,579,701 Won. Compared to the same period last year, Japanese depositors increased by 8.3% and Koreans by 3.2%, while the total amount increased by 5% for Japanese and 15% for Koreans. Businessman Mr. Yi Hŏn-nyŏng departed from Yokohama for the United States on a tour of Europe and America. A martial arts tournament hosted by the Chosŏn Martial Arts Hall (朝鮮 武道舘) was held at the Ch'ŏndogyo Church (天道敎堂).

5th
At the cabinet meeting on the 4th, it was decided to halt the dispatch of troops to Kando and instead send reinforcements of police officers from Chosŏn (300 urgently dispatched). The German Workers' Federation is reportedly campaigning for a half-holiday every Tuesday. The Kyŏngsŏng Municipal Office decided to levy school fees on citizens, divided into 5 brackets, as part of a plan to expand elementary schools in the city. In Kach'ang-myŏn, Talsŏng-gun, a major fight broke out between tenant farmers due to a landlord's tyranny (granting previously tenant-farmed land to someone newly subservient to him) (an incident on the 1st <109> where, due to police intervention, the ** [likely '논', paddy field] was farmed by the previous tenant). In Kongbuk-myŏn, Kanggye, an OO Group appeared and killed two OO (censored names/affiliation), it is reported. The Poor Students' Theater Troupe from Tōkyō studies is said to open its first performance in Pusan today.

6th
Mr. Kim Ka-jin of Tongnong, an elder of the independence movement who had stayed in Shanghai for 4 years, passed away in Shanghai at 10 PM on the 4th. All students from the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd years of Paejae High Common School (培材高普) petitioned the school authorities, citing teacher non-confidence and inadequate facilities. Ultimately, failing to reach an understanding, they began a joint school strike (同盟 休學) on the 6th. An Yong-ho (24) of Songnim-ri, Chasan-myŏn, Sunch'ŏn-gun, reportedly suffering from mental derangement, killed 8 members of his own family and neighbors with a large axe in the early morning of the 4th, and seriously injured over 10 others.

8th
An East-West Music Concert hosted by the Ch'ŏndogyo Youth Association (天道敎 少年會) was held at the Ch'ŏndogyo Church. A tennis tournament (庭球大會) hosted by the Kaebyŏk Publishing Company's Kaesŏng Branch was held at the Kaesŏng Samjŏngguk (Ginseng Monopoly Bureau) court. Hyŏn Tong-wan and Ch'oe Yong-hwan, secretaries of the YMCA (基督敎 青年會) sports department, are going to the United States as students. On the morning of the 7th, 5 people drowned due to flooding in the Kŭmho River in Taegu. The principals of Kyŏngsŏng's 7 major middle schools held a meeting at Sikto-wŏn Garden regarding the control of middle school students and made three major resolutions: Middle school students shall not participate in student assemblies; Those expelled for leading joint school strikes shall not be admitted to any school for one year; Regardless of which school a student belongs to, if they exhibit unseemly behavior, any teacher, regardless of their school, shall discipline them appropriately.

10th
Due to the storm (暴風雨) on the 7th, 14 motorboats and over 90 wooden boats were damaged or destroyed at Kuryongp'o in Yŏngil Bay, resulting in a major disaster with 25 deaths and over 70 serious injuries. The tennis tournament in Kaesŏng reportedly concluded successfully, with the victory going to the Songdo High School team (松高軍).

11th
The Kyŏnggi Province Police Department dispatched 60 police officers to Kando. The newly appointed Governor-General of Political Affairs, Ariyoshi, arrived in Kyŏngsŏng on the morning of the 11th. The damage to Koreans from the Tudugu bandit group's raid on June 28th is reported as: 5 houses completely burned, Hyŏn Tu-il lightly injured, and goods and cash worth 4,000-5,000 Won looted from Kim Tong-gyŏk's store.

12th
Yesterday, on the afternoon of the 11th at 4 PM, a major disturbance occurred within the Labor Mutual Aid Society (勞働共濟會), involving burning the signboard and injuring people. The cause was mutual distrust among executives; the assailant was Ko Sun-ch'im (27), and the victims were Yi Su-yŏng and Yun Tŏk-pyŏng. All Korean officials in the finance section of the Posŏng County Office reportedly resigned en masse (starting from the 6th), unable to endure insults from Japanese personnel. The Communications Bureau decided to establish new post offices (郵便所) at Chang'an Temple on Mt. Kŭmgang and in Marhwi-ri to facilitate convenience for general sightseers.

13th
The railway strike in the United States has reportedly worsened, with no prospect of resolution; railway operations have ceased over a distance of 3,000 miles, mail trains are reduced, and disturbances are severe everywhere. All workers at the electric company in Guangdong reportedly went on strike in sympathy with Mr. Sun Yat-sen (12th). In a mountain area in Kimdong-ri, Undongha-myŏn, Chŏnju-gun, the Chŏnju Police Station learned that certain individuals were gathered and massively counterfeiting (僞造) Bank of Chōsen 1 Won notes and Bank of Japan 50 Sen notes. They immediately arrested 6-7 counterfeiters and confiscated over 5,000 Won in counterfeit currency.

14th
The Hague Conference reportedly disbanded (13th) as an agreement with the Russian delegation could not be reached. The German government formally requested a suspension of reparations payments to the Allied Powers. The realization of Ilsin High Common School (一新高普校) in Chinju is said to be imminent as the 500,000 Won foundation fund has been fully raised. The Alumni Association Tennis Team (學友會 庭球團) reportedly achieved a great victory in Pusan (12th). <110>

15th
The Worker-Peasant Government (勞農政府 - Soviet Russia), as a demonstration against the Hague Conference, reportedly initiated a major mobilization from the Chinese border towards the Baltic region. There was strange news from Chinju that Confucian scholars (儒林) opposed new education and refused permission to establish a lecture hall at the Hyanggyo (local Confucian school), leading to a major dispute between Confucian scholars and youth. Then, in Andong, descendants of T'oegye (Yi Hwang) reportedly demolished a church built in front of the T'oegye Sŏwŏn (Confucian academy), deeming it unacceptable, causing a major conflict. Kwŏn Hŭi-mok, a doctor in Changhowŏn, Ich'ŏn, is said to be "eating prison rice" (facing legal consequences) for causing two deaths by improperly administering a morphine ("모히") injection (an incident on the 12th; the deceased were Yun T'ae-yŏng [32] and Yi Nak-ho [23]).

17th
Due to continuous heavy rain, the water level of the Han River reached 28 *ch'ŏk* (feet), and the number of flooded houses in Map'o-Tongmak reached over 380. There were no casualties, but many roads became impassable. The All-Chosŏn Football Tournament (全鮮蹴球大會) hosted by the *Tong-A Ilbo* Masan Branch began on the 17th, with 10 teams participating.

18th
The Songgyŏng (Kaesŏng) Alumni Association (松京學友會), taking the opportunity of Tōkyō students returning for the summer, opened a Summer Culture Research Society at Chŏnghwa Girls' School (貞和女學校) and is giving lectures on general science. Residents of Wangsimni formed the Wangsimni Development Promotion Association (往十里 發展 期成會) and made three major resolutions: Relocate the fertilizer yard; Relocate the sanitation department and crematorium; Eradicate the Sungsinin Cooperative (崇神人組合 - likely a Japanese Shinto-related or pro-Japanese group).

20th
The Korean laborers in Kobe number as many as 4,000, but lacking a unified organization and for relief from hardship, they organized the Kobe Korean Laborers' Friendship Association (神戶 朝鮮勞友會) to strive for mutual aid and established an education department to focus on children's education. Students from Iwŏn studying in Tōkyō, under the name Kwansŏngdan (觀城團), performed a play at Umigwan Theater in Kyŏngsŏng. In the Ŭiju region, due to the recent heavy rain, 70 houses were flooded, causing a major disaster.

21st
Mr. Yi In-hwan, one of the signatories of the Korean Declaration of Independence, was released from Kyŏngsŏng Prison on parole. The 2nd All-Chosŏn Youth Baseball Tournament (全鮮 第2回 少年野球大會), hosted by Saedongmu Sa and sponsored by the *Maeil Sinbo* newspaper company, opened at the Chungang High Common School grounds (from the 21st for 3 days). Over 200 citizens of Sŏngnam-ri, Hwangju, unable to bear the pressure on their livelihoods due to the issue of relocating the cattle market, were passing through Sariwŏn to petition the Provincial Office. They were stopped by the local police station, causing a major disturbance (incident on the 20th; they reportedly returned to Sariwŏn). According to the Communications Bureau's Money Order and Savings Management Bureau, unclaimed money orders amount to 16,000 Won, and if not claimed within this year, they will be incorporated into the national treasury.

23rd
The winners of the All-Chosŏn Youth Baseball Tournament were Chungang (school team) and Hyŏpsŏng Kurakpu (club team). A match between the Alumni Association Tennis Team (學友會 庭球團) and the All Kyŏngsŏng Tennis Team (全京城庭球團) was held over two days starting the 22nd at the Posŏng High School grounds, with the Kyŏngsŏng team winning two matches. A man named Pak Nae-yŏng (65) from Tang'in-ri, Tongmak, Koyang-gun, reportedly stabbed his wife Pak Chŏng-suk (32) to death with a short sword in a vegetable field in broad daylight and fled. Regarding Kyŏnggi Province's birth and death rates for one year: births were 30,140 males and 26,854 females; deaths were 29,010 males and 26,277 females. The significant difference between births and deaths is attributed to the development of sanitation and medicine, but it is said that Koreans still need to pay more attention to hygiene.

25th
Im Su-ch'ang (25), a patrolman at Chongno Police Station, was buying a bamboo screen (簾) from Pak Chun-sun (39), a screen merchant living at Changsŏng-dong 20, in the Chongno night market on the night of the 22nd. An argument arose over the price, ultimately leading to Im kicking Pak Chun-sun to death. Mrs. An Myŏng-suk (35), wife of Mr. Yu Yang-ho living in Nagwŏn-dong, Kyŏngsŏng, donated 1,000 Won out of the 4,000 Won she had saved with devotion for over 10 years to the Women's Poor Students Mutual Aid Association (女子 苦學生 相助會). Severely ill, she reportedly conveyed this wish as her last words to her husband on the 24th. The total number of schools (private) in all of Chosŏn as of the end of June is 655: 380 general schools and 275 religious schools. Since January this year, 19 schools were newly established, and 16 were abolished. Among the abolished, 5 were changed to public common schools, and over 10 were closed due to maintenance difficulties. <111>

**Summary**

This "Social Diary" for July 1922 chronicles daily events in Korea under Japanese rule, mixing local news with international snippets. It covers weather impacts (drought followed by rain and floods), social issues (poverty leading to suicide and reliance on pawnshops, public health concerns like cemetery capacity and birth/death rates, labor strikes in Korea and abroad), crime (murders, banditry in Manchuria, counterfeiting), education (school strikes, expansion plans, fundraising, sports tournaments), colonial administration actions (police deployment to Kando, censorship of *Kaebyŏk* magazine, insults by Japanese officials leading to resignations), independence movement-related news (death of Kim Ka-jin, release of Yi In-hwan, police crackdowns), and cultural events (concerts, lectures, formation of community groups). The diary provides a snapshot of the multifaceted life in colonial Korea, highlighting tensions, hardships, resistance, and everyday occurrences. Historians might find the juxtaposition of colonial oppression (censorship, police actions, discrimination) with Korean social and cultural activities (mutual aid societies, educational efforts, sports) particularly revealing. The data on poverty (pawnshop usage), public health statistics, and mentions of specific incidents like strikes, conflicts over land or traditions (Confucian vs. new education/religion), and crimes offer valuable details about the socio-economic conditions and tensions of the period.
