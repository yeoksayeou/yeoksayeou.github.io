The Grand Success of the Kaesŏng Tennis Tournament
						A Reporter from the Kaesŏng Branch

The Kaesŏng Tennis Tournament, jointly hosted by the Kaebyŏk Publishing Company Kaesŏng Branch and the Sinsaenghwal Publishing Company Kaesŏng Branch, and sponsored by the Tonga Ilbo Kaesŏng Bureau, uniting five counties—Changdan, P'aju, Yŏnbaek, Kanghwa, and Kŭmch'ŏn—starting with Kaesŏng County, opened on July 8th at the Samjŏngguk (Ginseng Monopoly Bureau) courts in T'aep'yŏngjŏng, within Kaesŏng city. The spectators, gathering since morning, filled the venue, numbering in the thousands. At 11:00 AM, 22 teams of energetic players, under the guidance of the officials, conducted the draw and then solemnly held the entrance ceremony. Following the opening address by the Branch Head and instructions from Chief Umpire Mr. Ko Kŭngmyŏng, the competition began. Mr. Cho Ki-kan from the Kaebyŏk Publishing Company Head Office specially attended that day. As Chief Umpire Mr. Ko Kŭngmyŏng declared the start of the competition, the applause of the packed crowd vibrated through the grounds. The competition started, and the results of the first round were:

Victory Goes to the Songgo Team

The Finals on the Second Day

The second day of the Kaesŏng Tennis Tournament also began as scheduled at 1:00 PM on the 9th. With Mr. Yi Hŭi-ch'ang as Chief Umpire, the second preliminary round, which had not finished the previous day, continued. The results were:

Second Round Preliminary Results (Continued)
Kim Sŏk-ho
Yi Wŏn-gyu   vs  Yi Sŏng-gu
Pak An-muk O
Chŏn Yŏ-sun
Kim Hŭng-gil   vs  Hŏ Myŏng-sun
Yi Yŏn-ŏp O
Ch'oe Sun-jo
O Han-ok  Walkover win

With this, the second preliminary round ended. After a 20-minute break for lunch, the third preliminary round began, and the atmosphere in the venue became very tense. The players from the Southern Epworth team and the Songgo team, who had drawn much attention at the All-Korea Tennis Tournament held in Kyŏngsŏng this spring, faced off. The results were:

Third Round Preliminary Results
Kim Sŏng-jin
Han Maeng-sŏk O  vs  Pak Yong-hak
Kim Yong-bong
Chŏn Yŏ-sun
Kim Hŭng-gil O vs Ch'oe Sun-jo
O Han-ok O
Yu Ŭn-sang
Han Chin-yŏng O  vs  Yi Sŏng-gu
Pak An-muk

After the third round, the remaining three teams were set to compete. Among them, two teams were from the Kaesŏng Southern Epworth team, and one was the Songgo team. The competition became even more interesting. As a result of the draw, the Songgo team was matched against the Southern team's "Pockmarked Captain" (곰보 大將), and one Southern team received a walkover, causing the 200-odd Songgo students to nearly lose hope. However, the Songgo team mustered even more spirit and ultimately defeated the "Pockmarked" team.

Fourth Round Preliminary Results
Chŏn Yŏ-sun
Kim Hŭng-gil   vs  Yu Ŭn-sang
Han Chin-yŏng O
Kim Sŏng-jin
Han Maeng-sŏk  Walkover win

After a 30-minute rest, the final championship match began. From the moment the match between the Southern team's Kim [Sŏng-jin] and Han [Maeng-sŏk] pair and the Songgo team's Yu [Ŭn-sang] and Han [Chin-yŏng] pair started, the spectator seating became disorderly, and the densely packed crowd's applause and cheers truly created great confusion. Amidst the cheers of the multitude, Songgo's Yu-Han pair defeated the Southern's Kim-Han pair. Thus, the final victory went to the Yu-Han pair.

Kim Sŏng-jin
Han Maeng-sŏk  vs  Yu Ŭn-sang
Han Chin-yŏng O

Amidst the confusion, the seats were reorganized, and the championship flag presentation ceremony was held. The Branch Head presented the championship flag to Mr. Yu Ŭn-sang and Mr. Han Chin-yŏng. Magazines donated by the head offices of both hosting companies were distributed to everyone, and the tournament concluded very successfully and smoothly amidst great excitement. Attending on that day were Mr. Pak Tal-sŏng from the Kaebyŏk Head Office, Mr. Sin Il-lyong from the Sinsaenghwal Head Office, and Mr. Ch'a Kwan-ho from the Chosŏn Sports Association.<108>

**Summary**

This article reports on a large-scale tennis tournament held in Kaesŏng in July 1922, organized by local branches of the Kaebyŏk and Sinsaenghwal publishing companies and sponsored by the Tonga Ilbo newspaper. The event drew thousands of spectators and featured 22 teams from Kaesŏng and five surrounding counties. The tournament spanned two days, culminating in a final match between the local Songdo High School team (Songgo-kun) and the Kaesŏng Southern Epworth team (Nambu Epwŏt-kun), with the Songgo team ultimately winning. Dignitaries from the publishing companies' head offices and the Chosŏn Sports Association attended the final day.

From a historical perspective, the article is interesting as it highlights the vibrant local sporting culture and organizational efforts by Korean entities (publishing houses, newspapers) during the colonial period. The involvement of specific schools like Songdo High and possibly church-affiliated groups like the Epworth League team points to the social structures fostering such activities. The mention of the "All-Korea Tennis Tournament" indicates a developing national sports scene. The regional scope (involving multiple counties) and the attendance figures suggest significant public interest and the role of sports in community life under Japanese rule. The detailed reporting of match results and player names provides valuable data for sports history research.
