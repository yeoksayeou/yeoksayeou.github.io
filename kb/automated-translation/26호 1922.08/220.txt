A Historical Study of Korean Art
						Pak Chonghong
Chapter 3: The Three Kingdoms Period
Section 1: Korea and Six Dynasties Art
Ko Chumong, who called himself the Son of the Heavenly Emperor and the maternal grandson of the River Earl (Habaek), and who made his own bow and arrows, hitting the mark with every shot, fled south from hardship and established the vast founding enterprise of Koguryŏ in the fertile land of Chŏlbon. This became the origin point that produced the martial, heroic art of the North. Pak Hyŏkkŏse, who emerged from Tol San Ko Hŏ Village (突山高墟村) and was hailed as king by the people of the six clans just over ten years later for his precocious and wise nature and his supposedly miraculous birth, laid the foundation for Silla's thousand-year kingdom, becoming the source of the refined, literary art of the South. Onjo, a prince of Koguryŏ who fled south fearing harm, founded Paekche. He synthesized the southern ethos, brought it to great completion, and whenever the people's profound reverence for aesthetics, combining sublimity and elegance, was fervently expressed, its spiritual resonance extended far overseas. Concurrent with the arrival of Buddhism, Buddhist art, naturally following its traditions, created an unprecedented era of flourishing in our art history. Soon, however, escaping from this, the unique artistic genius of our Paedal people produced original creations, and thus it ended.

The early period influenced by this refers to the time after the Han Dynasty's grand ambitions had declined, through the rise of the three kingdoms of Wei, Shu, and Wu, the Western and Eastern Jin, up to the formation of the Southern and Northern Dynasties—that is, the Six Dynasties period. Therefore, we must examine the nature of Six Dynasties art and further investigate its origins to trace the lineage of our art. <13>
Prior to this, in China, as early as 4,000 years ago during the time of the Yellow Emperor Xuanyuan, Cangjie is said to have created pictographic characters by imitating the forms of things. Shi Huang (史皇) is said to have originated painting, and Lei (嫘), the younger sister of Shun, excelled in painting, leading later generations to praise her as the ancestor of painting. During the Zhou Dynasty, images of Yao and Shun and depictions of Jie and Zhou were used for the purpose of encouraging good and punishing evil. It is said that when Confucius once admired these pictures, he lingered, unable to leave, and told his disciples that this was indeed the reason for the Zhou Dynasty's prosperity.

Around the 3rd century BCE, Qin Shi Huang unified the world, and his territory gradually expanded westward. Interaction with foreign countries greatly increased, and the culture of the Western Regions (Xiyu) was accordingly imported. Presumably, this created an opening for their arts to be transmitted as well. It is said that in the second year of Qin Shi Huang's reign, someone called Lielie (烈裔) came from the country of Qianxiao (鶱霄國) and, holding pigment in his mouth, sprayed it onto a wall, forming a dragon. He was also particularly skilled at painting phoenixes, and it was feared they looked so real they might fly away. In architecture, great structures like the Afang Palace were built, but later, when Qin burned books and buried scholars, learning fell into a long decline. The heroic Emperor Wu of Han (Han Wudi) greatly promoted cultural flourishing. As interactions with various states became frequent, exchanges with the Western Regions again thrived. The grape patterns on the backs of Han mirrors, for example, were based on grapes brought back from the Western Regions at this time. The widely told tragic story of Wang Zhaojun tells us of the Han emperor's deep trust in the figure painter Mao Yanshou, allowing us to infer that painting at that time was gradually approaching realism in depicting forms.

Thereafter, as interactions with the Western Regions greatly expanded, the eastward transmission of Buddhism eventually occurred. Emperor Ming of the Later Han (Hou Han Mingdi) dreamed of a golden Buddha and dispatched Cai Yin to the Yuezhi to bring back scriptures, statues, and paintings. He then had copies made and placed them at palace gates and on top of tombs. This became the beginning of Buddhist art in China, the driving force behind the flourishing of Six Dynasties art that we seek to examine closely, and the wellspring that created the golden age of the later Tang and Song dynasties. When the three kingdoms of Wei, Shu, and Wu stood like a tripod, the art of the southern state of Wu was considered the finest. Cao Fuxing of Wu once saw a red dragon appear above the Qingxi Stream, painted it, and presented it to the King of Wu, causing Lu Tanwei of the later Liu Song dynasty to marvel at its excellence. He was said to be particularly skilled at figure painting, which meant he transmitted the standards of Western Regions Buddhist art learned from the Indian monk Kang Senghui. Later, his disciple Wei Xie emerged, becoming the founder of Chinese Buddhist painting. Less than 50 years after the rise of the Three Kingdoms, Emperor Wu of the Western Jin unified the three kingdoms. However, the Hu tribes residing within the territory gradually grew stronger and rebelled. Jin could not withstand their pressure and eventually fell. Its remnants fled south, barely holding onto the Jiangnan region – this was the Eastern Jin. This era, the so-called period of the Five Hu and Sixteen Kingdoms, was marked by continuous warfare and calamity, <14> with ceaseless conflict, making it impossible even for loyal officials and determined scholars to predict their end. Pessimism arose, viewing this world as filled with merciless greed, and thoughts of aversion and escape reached a high tide, seeing this world as composed of falsehood and suffering. This aided the eastward spread of Buddhism, and seizing this opportunity, Buddhism from the Western Regions spread throughout the interior of China like a force sweeping the heavens.

Buddhism was transmitted to Korea during this period as well. Although the art of the time inevitably lacked perfection in depicting forms, because it was an external manifestation of fervent faith, it possessed an inexplicable spiritual resonance that naturally inspired reverence in the people. Therefore, the art initially transmitted, whether sculpture or painting, can be called substantial and complete in content, but it was extremely rudimentary in realistic representation of forms. How could this satisfy the boundless aesthetic imagination of our Paedal people? Thus, the time came to wield their spiritual skill. The endlessly flowing, original spiritual talent finally broke free from these traditional confines and produced infinite creations, flourishing domestically and spreading overseas, leading to the great synthesis and completion of the later period.

Following the gradual southward migration of the Han people, the philosophy of transcendent emptiness from the south, which was the crystallization of the free thought that had flourished since the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, became widely known among the people. Admiring freedom and loving nature, this eventually led Gu Kaizhi, deeply versed in Lao-Zhuang philosophy, to pioneer landscape painting. Gu Kaizhi was a disciple of Wei Xie, the founder of Buddhist painting. Considered one of the three great masters of the Six Dynasties and the progenitor of scientific criticism among Chinese painters, he was also said to excel at Buddhist images. Thus, he fused the art transmitted from the Western Regions with China's indigenous art, prompting a major development. Wang Xizhi's son, Xianzhi, created the "one-stroke" calligraphy style. This, in turn, led Lu Tanwei of the Liu Song dynasty to establish "one-stroke" painting, further revealing abstract beauty in East Asian art. During the parallel existence of the Southern and Northern Dynasties, the elegant and refined South and the heroic and bold North each transmitted their distinct characteristics. However, judging from Lu Tanwei's creation of one-stroke painting in the Liu Song, southern art, possessing the characteristics of East Asian art, was certainly not lacking in boldness. Xie He of the Southern Qi was a scientific painter following Gu Kaizhi. His discussion of the Six Principles of Painting has already been mentioned; by Xie He's time, the realistic depiction of forms in painting also gradually reached completion.

In 532 CE, Emperor Wu ascended the throne of Liang, receiving the abdication of Southern Qi. Emperor Wu was brilliant, versed in literature, and fond of painting. His reign saw great achievements. In contrast to the North, where the flames of war still raged, peace lasted for many years, and the people lived in security. Furthermore, Emperor Wu endlessly revered Buddhism, leading to a flourishing of direct importation of Indian Buddhism via sea routes. Bodhidharma, <15> the founder of Chinese Chan (Zen) Buddhism, was one of the monks who arrived by sea during this time and was welcomed. Although for the roughly 450 years since Buddhism first spread eastward to China, the art of the Gandhara region in the Western Regions had accompanied Buddhism spreading from the northwest border into the interior and reached the south, during this Liang dynasty, Buddhism from Central India was transmitted via sea routes. Consequently, its art was also received, spreading gradually northward with the South as its center. Regarding this transmission of Indian Buddhist art, it should be noted that Central Indian mural painting was undoubtedly imported during this period as well. It must have been similar to the Ajanta cave murals, which made significant contributions to the world's art and academic circles. This likely has considerable connection to the public discussion surrounding the surviving work of our Koguryŏ monk Tamjing (曇徵), the Hōryū-ji temple mural in Yamato (大和). Zhang Sengyou transmitted the Indian method of shading and pioneered the "boneless" (mogu 沒骨) wash technique, which was also an instance of Sinicizing Indian art. In the Northern Dynasties, successive emperors made Buddhism their state religion. Temples and pagodas flourished greatly, and consequently, Buddhist sculptures and paintings also developed significantly.

To summarize the lineage of Six Dynasties art, indigenous Chinese art already existed. However, starting from the time of Qin Shi Huang, people from the Western Regions began to travel back and forth. During the Former Han, interactions were quite active. By the time of Emperor Ming of the Later Han, art from the Western Regions, especially Buddhist art, was transmitted, opening the door to a period of maturity in Chinese art history and creating a major transitional phase. Later, during the Southern Liang period, along with the transmission of Chan (Zen) teachings from India (Tianzhu), Central Indian art arrived and spread from the south to the north. This contrasted with the Gandharan art that had flowed in through the northwest border during the Han and Jin periods, centered around Chang'an and Luoyang, and spread southeast.

So, what was the relationship with Korea? Northern art, born in Central Asia and forming the Northern Dynasties' art in China, had already spread to the Three Kingdoms, starting with Koguryŏ, and had reached a flourishing stage. Just as Central Indian art, the Ajanta lineage, depended on Southern China for its advance, it was also transmitted to our Korea around the time Paekche in the south was somewhat prosperous and Silla was gradually rising. The *Samguk Sagi* states:
In the 19th year of King Sŏng (聖王) (2nd year of King Chinhŭng (眞興王) of Silla, 11th year of King Anwŏn (安原王) of Koguryŏ, 7th year of Datong (大同) of Liang), Paekche sent an envoy to Liang, requesting Doctors of the *Mao Shi* (毛詩博士), texts like the *Nirvana Sutra* (涅槃等經義), along with artisans and painters (工匠畫師等), who accompanied the envoy back.
The 7th year of Liang Datong is an error for the 8th year, which is 542 CE. This was 170 years after Northern Buddhism was transmitted in the 2nd year of King Sosurim (小獸林王) of Koguryŏ (372 CE).

Gandharan art from the Western Regions, conceived in Hellenistic art, crossed steep high peaks and traversed desolate sandy plains, hearing the echoes of slaughter <16> everywhere, inevitably passing through the North, thus incorporating a heroic spirit and vigorous style. How could Koguryŏ, possessing the spirit to uproot mountains and cover the world, and inheriting the spiritually wondrous and profound aesthetic sensibility of the Paedal people, not embrace it?

The art of the Ajanta region in India, which formed its axis and foundation under the shade of lush coconut trees, crossed the vast southern seas and merged with the literary elegance of Southern China. To its warmth and refinement was added a profound charm, and to its clarity and beauty was added a graceful elegance. As it sought to achieve completion, it was drawn by the fresh, elegant, and sublime artistic genius of Paekche, thereby acquiring its southern characteristics.

Now, the Eastern art of the North and South, shaped by geographical changes and historical transitions, was further recast, and its crystallization selected. It is no wonder that the great synthesis and culmination of East Asian art, unprecedented in history, took place here on our Korean peninsula, blessed with high mountains, beautiful waters, and possessing both continental spirit and island elegance. The reason it holds a value superior to Greece or Rome in Western Europe, which blossomed by gathering the essence of only a small region, lies herein. Since the value of Korean art is such, its responsibility was truly heavy and great.

Section 2: Koguryŏ
Koguryŏ was indeed continental. Its flowing rivers were vast, its towering peaks lofty, and its expansive plains boundless. Summers were intensely hot, and winters severely cold. The people dwelling on such terrain surely possessed strong iron legs and were accompanied by imposing physiques. Their temperament was bold yet possessed the characteristic of perseverance, thus achieving strength and endurance. Its history is a record of activity on the vast plains. Conflicts were fierce, city walls were sturdy, and plans were consequently far-reaching. Thus, its unique culture combined with the northern spirit to produce Koguryŏ's art. Architecture surpassed mere size to become solemn, and painting transcended heroic strength to spontaneously emit spiritual resonance. However, in seeking its traces today, the first thing to note is that artistic relics or sites are generally scattered around the capital city sites, the centers of culture and politics.

Moreover, Koguryŏ established a total of four former capitals: Chŏlbon, Kungnae, Hwando, and P'yŏngyang. Let me briefly outline the historical facts of these transitions. The *Samguk Sagi* states: <17>
[Chumong] reached the Chŏlbon Stream (卒本川), observed that the soil was fertile and beautiful, and the mountains and rivers were strategically defensible. He thus desired to make it the capital but had no time to build a palace, merely constructing huts on the Piryu River (沸流水) to live in, naming the country Koguryŏ. In the autumn, the seventh month of the fourth year, he began constructing city walls and palaces.
Although its ancient site is difficult to determine today, historical facts confirm its proximity to Kungnae Castle (國內城), the second capital:
In the spring, the third month of the 21st year of King Yuri Myŏng (琉璃明王), the sacrificial pig for the suburban rites escaped. The king ordered Solchi (薛支), the master of sacrifices, to pursue it. He reached Kungnae Wina Rock (國內尉那巖), found it, and kept it at a house in Kungnae to raise it. Returning, he reported to the king, "Your servant pursued the pig to Kungnae Wina Rock and saw that its mountains and waters are deep and strategically sound, the land is suitable for the five grains, and there are abundant deer, elk, fish, and turtles. If Your Majesty moves the capital, not only will the people benefit endlessly, but the calamities of war can also be avoided." In the ninth month, the king went to Kungnae to observe the terrain. In the winter, the tenth month of the 22nd year, the king moved the capital to Kungnae Wina Rock Castle.
King Tongmyŏng Sŏng (東明聖王) built palaces in Chŏlbon, but just 37 years later, King Yuri Myŏng moved the capital to Kungnae Castle. Since it was a place reachable when chasing a lost pig, its proximity is self-evident without further argument. Some occasionally claim Chŏngch'ŏn (成川) is the old site of Chŏlbon and equate its palace with the area in front of Yongmyŏng Temple (永明寺) in P'yŏngyang, suggesting the Kuje Palace (九梯宮) was within it. However, no site identifiable as the remains of Kungnae Castle, the capital for over 200 years, has yet been found within pig-chasing distance of P'yŏngyang or Chŏngch'ŏn. Conversely, the Hŏt'aewang Stele (好太王碑, Kwanggaet'o Stele), which clearly records the repulsion of Wa invaders after accepting Silla's request for troops, now stands imposingly near Tonggu (通溝) in Ji'an County (輯安縣), Fengtian Province (奉天省). Numerous clusters of ancient tombs exhibiting Koguryŏ characteristics have been discovered nearby. Therefore, designating this as the site of Kungnae Castle is almost certainly correct. From this, we can infer that Chŏlbon was also not far from Tonggu in Ji'an County. How could someone chasing a pig possibly pursue it from the banks of the Taedong River (大同江) across the Amnok River (鴨綠江)? After more than 200 years, during the reign of the 10th king, Sansang (山上王), the capital was moved to Hwando (丸都).
In the spring, the second month of the second year, Hwando Castle was built. In the winter, the tenth month of the 13th year, the king moved the capital to Hwando.
Since ancient times, there have been many differing theories about Hwando Castle, leading only to mutual debate and attack, with no definite conclusion to date. As no particularly noteworthy remains from an art historical perspective have yet been discovered, we shall merely acknowledge the fact of the move and leave the search for the precise old site for a later time. During the 21st year of King Tongch'on (東川王), a fortress was finally built in P'yŏngyang.
In the spring, the second month of the 21st year, the king, deeming Hwando Castle unfit as a capital after being ravaged by war, built P'yŏngyang Castle (平壤城) and moved the populace and ancestral shrines there.
This year was 247 CE. The transmission of Buddhism occurred in 372 CE, meaning Buddhism arrived 125 years after P'yŏngyang Castle was first built. During the reign of King Kogugwŏn (故國原王), there was a temporary move back to Hwando, but after less than a year, the capital was moved again to East Hwang Castle (東黃城) in P'yŏngyang. <18>
In the autumn, the eighth month of the fourth year, P'yŏngyang Castle was expanded.
In the spring, the second month of the twelfth year, Hwando Castle was repaired, and Kungnae Castle was also fortified. In the autumn, the eighth month, the residence was moved to Hwando Castle.
In the autumn, the seventh month of the thirteenth year, the residence was moved to P'yŏngyang East Hwang Castle. The castle is located in present-day Sŏgyŏng (西京, P'yŏngyang) East Mokmyŏk Mountain (木覓山中).
Thus, P'yŏngyang became the political center. Later, following the arrival of Buddhism, King Kwanggaet'o (廣開土王) founded nine temples in P'yŏngyang, making it even more of a cultural center.
In the 15th year of King Changsu (長壽王), the capital was moved to P'yŏngyang.
In the 28th year of King P'yŏngwŏn (平原王), the capital was moved to Chang'an Castle (長安城).
In the 15th year of King Changsu, the capital was moved to P'yŏngyang; the Anhak Palace site (安鶴宮址) at the foot of P'yŏngyang's Taesŏng Mountain (大城山下) seems to be it. In the 28th year of King P'yŏngwŏn, the capital was finally moved to Chang'an Castle, which is the present-day P'yŏngyang Castle. Bordered by the Taedong River to the southeast, flanked by the Pot'ong River (普通江) to the west, and with Moran Peak (牧丹峰) rising as a natural stronghold to the north, although undeniably small in scale, it is truly a fortress embodying the distinctive Korean style. Koguryŏ's final years indeed ended within this castle.

The transitions of the capital were roughly as described above, but even after each move, the old capitals were not abandoned. King Kogugwŏn repaired Hwando and Kungnae Castles, and furthermore:
In the spring, the second month of the second year, the king went to Chŏlbon, performed rites at the ancestral shrine of the founder, inquired after the elderly and sick among the populace, and provided relief. In the third month, he returned from Chŏlbon.
His longing for the old capital was like this. This can also be inferred from the discovery of ancient tombs influenced by Buddhist art near Kungnae Castle. However, among these various castles, Kungnae Castle, moved to by King Yuri, served as the capital for about 206 years, and P'yŏngyang Castle, inhabited from King Changsu's time, for about 159 years. Counting the periods when P'yŏngyang and its vicinity served as the capital before and after that, the total reaches about 300 years. Therefore, Koguryŏ remains and relics possessing artistic value are also located near the two castles of Kungnae and P'yŏngyang. Here, I intend to explore and arrange these, examining the historical changes in their origins, characteristics, etc. <19>

1. Architecture
The Three Kingdoms period was characterized by incessant warfare and conflict, making the task of establishing capitals and building fortifications naturally favor strategic locations with mountains and rivers, aiming for impregnable defenses, thus reaching a stage of great development. However, successive kings, though living in tumultuous times, revered Buddhism and protected it devotedly. Consequently, numerous Buddhist temples were founded, and various architectural forms influenced by them also created a flourishing period hardly seen even in later ages.

That Koguryŏ architecture was solemn has been briefly discussed before. According to the *Haedong Yŏksa* (海東繹史):
Inside the Koguryŏ royal palace was a Crystal Castle (水晶城), about one li square, which shone brightly like daylight before dawn.
The brilliance of the Crystal Castle was such. Considering the discovery in later Silla of roof tile fragments coated with glass (琉璃), one cannot help but imagine that perhaps this castle too was made of something like artificial glass. However, lacking any concrete evidence, it is too early to make a definite judgment. It seems best to merely infer the extreme splendor of the palaces and gate towers built above ground from the imposing size of the numerous *kwǐwa* (鬼瓦, goblin-faced roof tiles) found near Kungnae and P'yŏngyang and the heroic forms of the goblin faces on them. As above ground, so below ground; like the remains of the Nangnang (樂浪) period, Koguryŏ art can also be studied through subterranean structures. In discussing this here, as there isn't space to enumerate each one, I will only select those that clearly show characteristics of temperament, which are most convenient for tracing the path of historical development, and those possessing technical distinctiveness. Furthermore, I wish to explore sufficient materials to research the lineage of Koguryŏ architecture and examine its origins through artifacts.

About 2 *li* northwest of Tonggu stands the Hŏt'aewang Stele. In several nearby locations, enormous stone mounds can be found. These are the General's Tomb (將軍塚), the Great King's Tomb (太王陵), etc. Observing the currently well-preserved General's Tomb, one is first struck by its grand and extraordinary structure. Soon, one cannot help but feel a sense of inviolable sublime beauty in its solemn and dignified presence. This stone tomb, presumed to belong to the early period after the introduction of Buddhism based on the frequent use of lotus patterns on tile fragments found nearby, consists of 7 layers, reaching a total height of 46 *ch'ŏk* (尺, feet). As one ascends from the lower to the upper layers, the height of each layer decreases proportionally. From this alone, one can imagine how well the people of that time employed the principle of proportion in plastic arts. Moreover, each main layer is further divided into 3 smaller layers, <20> which also decrease in size successively from bottom to top. It is impossible to know what term was used in the Koguryŏ period for this method, but they skillfully employed something even a step beyond what is generally recognized today as the quantitative law of formal beauty, the so-called Golden Rule. Its overall form achieves symmetry (均齊, Symmetry) with identical construction on the left and right sides, thus perfectly embodying the form of quantitative beauty. This shows that scientific formal beauty was not neglected; on the contrary, several stages of advancement had already been achieved.

However, here we feel the need to consider the essence of quantitative beauty. That is, our aesthetic pleasure in quantitative beauty does not lie purely in the rationality of its form. We perceive formal beauty when the form is recognized and contemplated as concretely expressing an ideal inherent within it. External diversity expresses internal diversity, and external unity expresses internal unity. Thus, I intend to infer the internal ideal expressed in the General's Tomb from its form. The stone tomb, standing majestically on a massive base, forms a mound shape with an appropriate slope and maintains left-right symmetry. Large stones, about 2 *kan* (間) high, are erected at several points around the tomb's periphery to support it. The stacking of each layer conforms to formal beauty, indicating stability due to the relationships of central forces. Simultaneously, the perceived power-beauty (力美) can be inferred to be static. Stability incorporates immensity, thereby manifesting the quality of firmness and immovability. The statically perceived power-beauty, having fought countless storms and torrential rains over the long period of more than 1,500 years, shows no sign of collapse and remains perfectly preserved to this day, revealing its resilient and tenacious internal dynamism. Combined with the quantitative beauty of time, signifying permanence, this feeling is further intensified. However, it is only possible to separate spatial and temporal aspects when discussing this abstractly; when actually encountering something like the General's Tomb, the two are always in a combined state. Therefore, the inherent power-beauty is felt even more strongly. Thus, through the artifacts of our ancestors, however incompletely, we can perhaps imagine the nature of the Paedal people and the progress of their architecture, which expressed their 'All'.

Koguryŏ architecture possesses a unique characteristic common throughout: regardless of whether it's a stone or earth mound tomb, the inner burial chamber (玄室) is invariably stone-built, and from the upper corners of its walls, elaborate corbelling (持送, Corvel) extends upwards to connect with the ceiling. This is precisely it. While the Nangnang period already had vaulted ceilings (穹窿天井), Koguryŏ advanced further by adding corners to the circle, creating a more developed corbelling method. Corbels were projected to narrow the ceiling area. Triangular corbels were then built at the four upper corners to narrow it further, creating a square ceiling shifted in orientation. Triangular corbels were built again at the four corners of this upper section, making the ceiling even smaller and increasing the height. Finally, a single large stone slab covers it. Indeed, the technique displays the utmost <21> skill. Even today, with advanced architectural technology, such techniques are rare. Building triangular corbels after the initial corbelling creates layers, preserving a sense of stability. The narrowed ceiling further increases the height, adding a sense of sublimity when combined with the spirit-filled murals. Since this was the era when Gandharan art was imported, there was undoubtedly a connection to Greek art, but it's difficult to accept it as purely Greek style. Some often disregard the lineage within our own art history, seize upon a partial similarity in form, and immediately declare it purely Greek. However, tombs like the Sannyŏnhwa Tomb (散蓮花塚) near Tonggu and the Kamsin Tomb (龕神塚) in Yonggang County (龍岡郡), South P'yŏngan Province (平南), have walls on all four sides that curve inwards as they rise, and then form a ceiling similar to the one described above, generally approximating a dome shape. Observing this, we can infer the path by which the semi-circular vaulted ceiling, already present in the Nangnang period, evolved through the creative genius of the Koguryŏ people into the uniquely corbelled ceiling. Its origin lies intrinsically within us and should not be forgotten. The Pantheon (판데온神殿) in Rome was built around 27 BCE for the sacred gods, featuring a semi-circular dome ceiling. Today's architects marvel that this circular roof has remained unmoved for over 2,000 years. On the Korean peninsula too, vaulted ceilings existed in the Nangnang period, and by the Koguryŏ era, even subterranean chambers featured ceilings of a form several steps more advanced, which remain perfectly preserved to this day. The similarity between the peninsula arts of East and West presents another intriguing phenomenon. Furthermore, the tendency to shift from circles to squares, from curvilinear beauty to rectilinear beauty, which is increasingly evident in today's art, also resembles the changes in Koguryŏ-era architectural techniques.

Having discussed the characteristics of the architecture, we now wish to examine its architectural relationship with Gandharan art, which influenced it. About 10 *chō* (町) northwest of Chinji-dong Station (眞池洞驛) on the P'yŏngnam Line (平南線), there is an earthen mound tomb. While its ceiling structure is not particularly different from others, two octagonal pillars stand opposite each other between the front and rear chambers. For this reason, this tomb is called Ssangnyŏngch'ong (雙楹塚, Twin Pillars Tomb). It features capitals (柱頭, Capital) and bases (基盤, Base) decorated with lotus patterns, and the pillar shafts (柱身) are painted with coiling dragons (蟠龍), something unobtainable elsewhere. This truly testifies to the considerable influence of Gandharan art, which carried the tradition of Greek art.

Gandharan architectural techniques were influenced by India, Persia, Rome, etc., but the art of this period is known as Greco-Buddhist, having been formed by transmitting the Greek lineage, making this its sole distinguishing feature. Therefore, it must have transmitted Greek styles. Greek architecture <22> has roughly three styles: Doric (도리크), Ionic (아이오니크), and Corinthian (코린스). Among these, the Corinthian style emerged last and is considered the finest, though each has distinct characteristics: Doric excels in robust spirit, Ionic in elegant grace, and Corinthian in delicate refinement. The architectural style imported into Gandhara was primarily this Corinthian style, with the use of capitals decorated with motifs like acanthus (아갼사스) and honeysuckle (忍冬) being most prevalent. However, when the Corinthian style, characterized by delicacy among the various forms, was transmitted to Koguryŏ, it can be inferred that the people of that time, despite possessing an unyielding nature, did not solely favor grandeur and heroism. Contemporary literature, while exuding a grand spirit, was not without undercurrents of different tendencies, as evidenced by King Yuri Myŏng's "Song of the Orioles" (黃鳥歌):
Fluttering orioles, male and female lean on each other. Thinking of my solitude, with whom shall I return?
Is this not the king's lament after losing Princess Ch'ihŭi (稚姬)? However, this occupied only a minor place in their character, as indicated by Ŭlchi Mundŏk's (乙支文德) poem sent to Yu Zhongwen (遺于仲文詩):
Your divine strategies fathom the heavens, your wondrous plans exhaust the earth. Your victorious merits are already high; know contentment and please wish to stop.
Thus, the Corinthian capital, characterized by delicacy, saw its acanthus motif change to lotus petal patterns (蓮瓣紋樣), its round shaft transformed into an octagon, and the proportion between pillar length and diameter differed from the original, creating the robust twin pillars characteristic of Koguryŏ.

Much has been said about architecture. How should we view it? It might be called the history of the northern Paedal people, imbued with the martial spirit of the North, conquering the imitation of foreign art in order to express themselves through the conscience of artistic creation.
...(To be continued)... <23>

**Summary**

This article by Pak Chonghong, published in 1922, discusses the origins and characteristics of art during Korea's Three Kingdoms period (Koguryŏ, Silla, Paekche), positioning it within the broader context of East Asian art history, particularly its relationship with Chinese Six Dynasties art and the transmission of Buddhism. It highlights the distinct northern (Koguryŏ - heroic, continental) and southern (Silla, Paekche - refined, elegant) artistic spirits, tracing influences from China (Han, Six Dynasties) and ultimately from Gandhara (Greco-Buddhist) and Central India (Ajanta). The second section focuses specifically on Koguryŏ, detailing its capital shifts (Chŏlbon, Kungnae, Hwando, P'yŏngyang) and analyzing its architecture, particularly tomb structures like the General's Tomb and the Twin Pillars Tomb, emphasizing their unique blend of monumentality, technical skill (corbelled ceilings), and adaptation of foreign styles (like the Corinthian order) into a distinctly Koguryŏ form. From a colonial history perspective, the article is interesting for its strong assertion of a unique Korean ("Paedal") artistic genius and national spirit, even while acknowledging foreign influences. It emphasizes Korean agency in adapting and transforming external artistic forms (like Gandharan or Chinese styles) to express inherent national characteristics, reflecting a cultural nationalist sentiment common during the period, seeking to establish a distinct and valuable Korean identity in the face of Japanese colonial rule. The detailed discussion of Koguryŏ's continental power and unique architectural achievements implicitly contrasts with the contemporary colonial situation.

第3章 3國時代
第1節 朝鮮과 六朝美術
所謂 天帝之子요 河伯之外孫으로써 自任하며 自作弓矢하야 射之에 百發百中하얏다는 高朱蒙이 難을 南으로 避하야 廣遠한 高句麗의 建國之業을 泉甘地肥한 卒本에 開하니 이곳 北方의 武風的 雄豪한 藝術을 做出케한 源頭가 되엇스며 突山高墟村에서 呱呱의 聲을 發한지 不過 10有餘年의 朴赫居世는 그의 爲人이 岐嶷然夙成하고 그의 生이 또한 神異하다 하야 6部의 民人이 그들의 君主로 推尊하니 新羅千歲의 國礎가 이에 始立할 새 南方의 文人的 雅麗한 藝術이 生케된 原由가 되도다. 被害를 慮하야 南奔한 高句麗의 王子 溫祚는 百濟를 建하니 南方의 風氣를 執中하야 此를 大成하고 그 崇高와 優雅를 兼備한 民人의 審美에 對한 敬虔之誠이 熱烈하게 發할 때마다 그의 靈韻은 멀리 海外에까지 波及하도다. 佛法의 傳來와 同時에 그 初期에 在하야 佛敎美術이 勿論 그 傳統을 繼하야 우리 美術史上 未曾有의 勃興時代를 作하얏섯나니 未幾에 그 中에서 超脫하야 우리 倍達族의 獨特한 藝術的 天才는 玆에 創作을 出하고야 巳하도다.
그의 影響을 蒙한 初期라 함은 中國漢室의 雄圖가 旣傾하고 魏·蜀·吳의 3國이 起하얏다가 西晋, 東晋을 經하야 南北朝를 作하기까지니 即 六朝時代를 指稱함이라. 然則 六朝時代 美術의 如何를 考究하며 更히 그의 所由來를 探覈하야써 우리 美術의 系統을 査察치 아니치 못할 지로다.＜13＞
先是에 中國은 4,000載以前 黃帝 軒轅氏 時代에 이미 蒼頡은 物形을 象하야 象形文字를 創製하얏다하며 史皇은 繪畵를 刱始하얏다 하고 舜의 妹弟인 嫘는 繪畵에 長하매 後世에 繪畵의 祖로까지 稱頌함에 至하도다. 周代에는 堯舜의 容과 桀紂의 像을 畫하야써 勸善懲惡의 用에 供하얏나니 孔子- 일즉 此圖를 賞할 새 徘徊不能去라가 그 弟子에게 此가 實로 周室의 盛한 所以라 하엿다 傳하도다.
西紀前 3世紀頃에 秦始皇이 天下를 統一하매 그의 領域이 漸次 西邊으로 擴張하니 外邦諸國과의 交涉이 大興하야 西域의 文化도 조차 輸入되다. 推想컨대 그들의 美術 等도 이에 傳來하는 端緖를 作한 듯하니 秦始皇帝 2年에 烈裔라 稱하는 者- 鶱霄國으로부터 入朝하야 그 口에 丹靑을 含하고 壁에 噴寫하니 이에 龍을 成하고 또 더욱 鳳凰을 善畫하니 軒軒然飛去할가 恐하얏다 전하도다. 建築으로도 阿房宮과 如한 大建築이 興하얏섯스나 其後 秦이 書를 焚燒하며 儒를 坑沒시키매 學術의 頹廢가 旣久함에 至하얏도다. 彼 雄偉한 漢武帝는 크게 文運의 盛隆을 圖하니 諸邦과의 交通이 頻繁하야짐을 隨하야 西域과의 往來가 또다시 盛行하게 되도다. 漢鏡背面의 葡萄紋樣 等은 即 此時에 西域으로서 持歸한 葡萄에서 範을 取한 者-라. 世人의 相傳하는 바- 王昭君의 哀話는 人物畫가 毛延壽에게 漢帝의 信任이 重하얏슴을 吾人에게 告하나니 當時 繪畫의 形似가 寫實에 漸近하얏섯슴을 可測할지라.
其後 漸次 西域과의 交涉이 大開하매 듸디어 佛敎의 東傳을 成하니 後漢 明帝는 金色의 佛陀를 夢하고 蔡愔을 月氏에게 遣하야 經典彫像畵像 等을 持歸케 하고 更히 此等의 模作을 製하야 宮門과 陵上 等에 安置하다. 이에 中國의 佛敎美術을 生한 嚆矢가 되엇거니와 더욱 吾人이 穿考코저하는 六朝美術의 勃興을 做出케한 動力이 되엇스며 後世 唐宋의 黃金時代를 成한 源泉을 作하도다. 魏, 蜀, 吳의 3國이 鼎立할 새 當時는 南方 吳國의 美術이 最優하얏나니 吳의 曹弗興이 일즉 淸溪上에 赤龍이 顯함을 見하고 此를 寫하야 吳王에게 獻하매 後代 劉宋의 陸探微로 하야곰 그 妙를 稱嘆케 하얏스며 特히 人物畫에 長하얏다 云하니 이는 곳 天竺僧康僧會에게 就하야 西域 佛敎美術의 軌範을 傳함이요. 後에 그 弟子 中에서 中國佛敎畫의 鼻祖인 衛協을 出하다. 3國이 興起한지 不過 50年에 西晋 武帝가 3國을 統一하엿스나 領內에 蟄居하던 胡族이 漸次 强盛하야 난을 起하니 晉은 그의 壓迫을 不堪하야 듸디어 滅하고 이에 그 遺族이 南下하야 江南의 地를 僅保함에 至하니 이곳 東晋이라. 此時代는 所謂 5胡16國의 戰亂과 禍難이 相繼하야＜14＞ 爭攻이 不息할 새 비록 節士志*이라도 그의 臨終을 不可測이라. 無情한 貪慾으로 充滿된 此界라 하야 悲觀*되며 虛僞와 煩惱로써 做成된 此世라하야 厭避의 思想이 高潮에 達하매 佛敎의 東傳을 助하니 此機를 乘하야 西域의 佛敎가 盪天之勢로 中國 內部에 蔓延하다.
佛敎가 朝鮮에 傳來한 것도 此時代니 비록 當代의 美術이 形似에는 不完全함을 未免할지나 그 等의 熱烈한 信仰이 外形에 發露한 者임으로 不可思議한 靈韻이 眞迫하야 民人으로 하야곰 崇敬의 念을 自起케 하얏슬지로다. 故로 傳來 當時의 美術은 彫刻으로서나 繪畫로서나 그 內容은 充足하며 完全타 稱할지나 象을 具한 寫實에는 甚히 幼稚한 者-라. 어찌 이로써 우리 倍達族의 濶漫無窮한 審美의 想을 滿足케함을 得하얏스리오. 이에 그 靈腕을 揮試할 時期는 오도다. 滾滾不絶한 獨創的 靈才는 듸디어 此等 傳襲圈 內에서 超脫하야 無窮無盡한 創作을 做出하니 國內에 興하며 海外로 發하야 後期의 渾融大成을 作하도다.
漢族의 漸次 南遷함을 從하야 春秋戰國時代로부터 勃興한 自由思想의 結晶軆를 作한 南方의 超脫的 虛無의 哲學은 此 人間에 膾炙됨에 至하도다. 이에 自由를 慕하며 自然을 愛하야 듸디어 老莊哲學에 深奧한 顧愷之로 하야곰 山水畫를 始傳케 하얏도다. 顧愷之는 佛畵의 祖衛協의 弟子라. 六朝의 3大家로서 中國畵家의 科學的 批評家의 嚆矢가 되엇다하며 더욱 佛像에도 長하얏다하니 即 西域으로부터 傳來한 美術과 中國 本有한 美術科를 融合하야 玆에 一大發展을 促함에 至하도다. 王羲之 子 獻之가 1筆書를 創始하니 此亦 劉宋의 陸探微로 하야곰 1筆畫를 創設케하야 더욱 東洋美術上 抽象美를 現케하도다. 南北朝가 並立함을 當하야는 風雅溫籍한 南部와 雄大豪放한 北部가 各其 特色을 傳하얏스나 劉宋의 陸探微가 1筆畫를 創하얏슴으로써 推測컨대 南方美術도 勿論 東洋美術의 特色을 具備한 以上 雄渾함을 不敢함은 아니엇도다. 南齊의 謝赫은 顧愷之 以後의 科學的 畵家니 畫의 6法을 論하얏슴은 이미 術한바-어니와 謝赫에 至하야 畫의 形似도 漸次 完備함에 至하도다.
西紀 532年 南齊의 禪을 受하야 梁의 武帝가 立하니 武帝- 爲人이 英邁하야 文學에 通하며 繪畫를 是好할 새 治績이 또한 大擧하니 北方의 兵燹이 尙且不息함에 反하야 太平이 年久하며 民人이 安堵함에 至하고 더욱 武帝는 佛敎를 信崇하기 不已할 새 이에 天竺佛敎가 海路로부터 直接으로 輸入함이 盛行하게 되도다. 中國禪宗의 始祖라는 菩提達磨는＜15＞ 當時에 渡航한 僧侶로서 歡迎을 受한 者의 1人이라. 中國에 佛法이 東傳한지 자못 450年 間에 至하도록 西域 「간다라」地方의 美術이 西北境으로부터 內部로 蔓延하는 佛法과 伴하야 南方에까지 波及하얏스나 此 梁代에 至하야는 海路를 經하야 中部印度의 佛法이 傳來하매 美術도 그의 系統을 傳受하니 更히 南方을 中心地로 하야 漸次 北方으로 傳及하게 되도다. 此 印度佛敎美術의 傳來에 對하야 注意할 것은 中部印度의 壁畫도 勿論 此時代에 輸入되엇슬 것임이라. 印度의 壁畵로서 世界美術界, 學術界에 貢獻함이 多大한 「아쟌타」Ajanta 洞窟의 壁畵와 類를 同히하는 자이엇슬지니 우리 高句麗 曇徵의 遺墨인 大和 法隆寺 壁畵에 關한 世論과 不少한 因緣을 有할지로다. 張僧繇는 印度의 陰影法을 傳하고 更히 沒骨皴을 初創하니 이 또한 印度美術을 中國化한 者이엇도다. 北朝에는 歷代의 帝王이 各各 佛敎로써 그 國敎를 作하니 伽藍과 塔 等이 大興하며 조차 佛像 等 彫刻과 繪畵가 크게 發達하도다.
以上 六朝美術의 系統을 槪括하면 中國本有의 美術이 旣存하얏섯스나 秦始皇時에 西域人의 往來가 始行하야 前漢時에는 交涉이 頗盛하얏섯스며 後漢 明帝時에 至하야는 西域의 美術 特히 佛敎美術이 傳來하매 中國美術史上 圓熟期에 至할 門戶를 展開하야 一大 過渡期를 作하도다. 그後 南梁時代에 天竺으로부터 禪敎가 傳來함을 隨하야 中部印度의 美術이 渡來하니 南部로부터 北部에 蔓延할 새 漢代와 晋時에 西北境으로 流入한 即 「간다라」의 美術이 長安 洛陽을 中心地로 東南에 流布하얏슴과 對하는 바-로다.
然則 朝鮮과의 關係는 如何한가. 中央亞細亞에 生하야 中國의 北朝美術을 形成한 北部美術은 高句麗로 爲始하야 3國에 이미 流通하니 오히려 勃興의 域에 至하얏스며 中部印度美術 即 「안쟌타」系統의 美術은 그 步運을 中國南部에 依하얏슴과 가티 우리 朝鮮에도 南部의 百濟가 稍盛하며 新羅가 漸興함에 及하야 이 또한 中部印度式의 美術이 傳來하도다. 史記에 云
聖王19年(新羅眞興王 2年·高句麗安原王 11年 ·梁 大同7年) 百濟遣 使如梁, 表請毛詩博士, 涅槃等經義, 幷工匠畫師等從之.
梁大同7年은 8年之誤니 西紀 542年이라. 高句麗 小獸林王 2年(西紀 32年) 北方佛敎가 傳來한지 170年 後라.
希臘的 美術에 胚胎된 西域의 「간다라」美術이 峻險한 高嶺을 越하며 荒漠한 沙原을 望하고 到處에 殺伐의 餘  을＜16＞ 聞하야 餘地업시 北部를 歷涉하니 雄豪한 氣韻과 勁健한 風趣를 容한지라. 拔山蓋世의 氣魄을 持한 高句麗가 倍達族의 靈異幽邃한 審美의 情을 稟傳한 以上 그를 含納치 아니하고 可히 止할자-랴.
鬱蒼한 椰子樹蔭에서 軸을 成하며 基를 作한 印度 「안쟌타」地方의 美術이 洋洋한 南海를 渡航하야 中國南部의 文雅와 融會할 새 溫籍에 幽遠의 趣가 加하며 淸佳에 優麗의 美가 添하야 그 完實을 結코저할 새 百濟의 鮮雅崇高한 藝術的 天才에게 誘引되어 이에 그 南方的 特色을 具備함에 至하도다.
今에 地理的 變遷과 歷史的 推移를 具當한 南北方의 東洋美術을 이에 更히 鑄出하야 그의 結晶을 選하게 되도다. 有史以來 未曾有한 東洋美術의 大成結集이 果然 우리 山高水麗한 大陸的 氣風과 島國的 雅趣를 具備한 우리 槿花半島에서 擧行케 되엇슴도 無怪한 바-어니와 1小局部의 精뿐을 聚하야 華를 發한 西歐의 希臘이나 羅馬에게 比하야 一頭上位의 價値를 有한 所以가 此에 在하니 朝鮮美術의 價値가 如斯한 以上 그의 責任이야 眞實로 重하며 또 大하얏도다.

第2節 高句麗
高句麗는 果然 大陸的이라. 橫流하는 山河는 망망하며 屹立한 高嶺은 巍巍하고 광활한 原野는 邊이 無하얏도다. 炎熱은 심하며 猛寒은 酷하니 如斯한 地盤에 雄據하는 民人이야 실로 勁健한 鐵脚을 具치 아니치 못할지며 偉大한 軆軀를 伴치 아니치 못할지라. 그들의 氣質은 豪放하면서도 오히려 堅忍不拔의 特性을 備하얏섯나니 故로 强大하고도 固久함을 得하얏도다. 그의 歷史는 廣敞한 原野에서 活躍한 記錄이라. 爭攻은 激烈하고 城壁은 堅固할 새 劃策이 딸하 遠大하얏섯도다. 이에 그 特殊한 文化는 北方的 氣風을 結合하야 高句麗의 美術을 做出케하니 建築은 巨大를 超하야 莊嚴하얏고 繪畵는 雄健을 脫하야 靈韻이 自發하도다. 然而 今日에 至하야 그 遺痕을 探覈코저 할 새 爲先 吾人의 注意할 바는 美術的 遺物 或은 遺跡은 大槪 文化와 政治의 中心地되는 그 國都의 城址 附近에 散在함이라.
더욱 高句麗는 卒本, 國內, 丸都, 平壤, 凡 4個所의 舊都를 作하니 今에 그 歷史的 遷移의 事實을 略述코저 하노라. 史記에 云＜17＞
俱至卒本川, 觀其土壤肥美, 山河險固, 遂欲都焉而未遑作宮室, 但結盧於沸流水上居之, 國號高句麗. 四年秋七月, 營作城廓宮室.
今에 그 古址를 確定키 難하나 第2次의 國都이엇든 國內城과의 距離가 相近함은 史實에 依하야 可證할지니
琉璃明王二十一年春三月, 郊豕逸, 王命掌牲薛支逐之, 至國內尉那巖得之, 拘於國內人家養之, 返見王曰臣逐豕至國內尉那巖, 見其山水深險, 地宜五穀, 又多糜鹿魚鱉之産, 王若移都, 則不唯民利之無窮, 又可免兵革之患也, 九月王如國內觀地勢, 二十二年冬十月, 王遷都於國內尉那巖城.
東明聖王이 卒本에 宮室을 營한지 不過 37年에 琉璃明王이 國內城으로 遷都하니 豕를 失하얏다하야 此를 追從할만한 處인즉 그의 相近함은 再辯을 不俟하야 自明할지라. 世에 間或 卒本의 古墟를 成川이라 稱하며 그 宮室을 平壤 永明寺 前에 擬하야 9梯宮이 그 內에 有하얏다하나 200餘年 間이나 都하얏든 國內城의 遺墟라 認할만한 處所가 平壤이나 成川에서 豕를 遂할만한 距離에 尙且 發見됨이 無하며 此와 反하야 新羅의 請兵을 納한 後 倭人을 擊退한 記錄이 歷然한 好太王碑(廣開土王碑)가 今에 奉天省 輯安縣 通溝 附近에 雄立하야 잇고 近傍에서 高句麗의 特色을 具備한 古墳羣을 多數 發見하얏슨즉 此를 國內城址로 推定하나 幾乎無誤함을 得할지니 由是觀之컨대 卒本도 輯安縣 通溝에서 不遠한 者임을 推測할지요. 豕를 遂하는 자- 豈可以 大同江岸에서 鴨綠 越便에까지 追及함을 得하얏슬 것이랴. 其後 200餘年을 經하야 第10代 山上王 時에 至하매 丸都로 遷都하도다.
二年春二月, 築丸都城. 十三年冬十月, 王移都於丸都.
自古로 丸都城에 對하야는 異說이 頗多할새 各其 論難 攻擊할 뿐이요 于今에 結末이 不確하니 吾人은 美術史上 特히 可考할만한 遺跡이 아즉 發見되지 못한 以上 다만 移都의 事實이엇슴만 證하고 確實한 舊址의 探究는 後期로 讓함이 可할가 하노라. 東川王 21年에 至하야는 듸디어 平壤에 城을 築하니
二十一年春二月, 王以丸都城經亂不可復都, 築平壤城, 移民及廟社.
此年은 西曆 247年이요 佛敎 傳來는 西曆 372年의 事인즉 平壤城을 初築한지 125年 後에 비롯오 佛法이 東傳하얏도다. 故國原王 時에 至하야는 一時 丸都로 移居하얏섯나니, 1年을 不過하야 更히 平壤 東黃城에 都하다.＜18＞
四年秋八月, 增築平壤城.
十二年春二月, 修葺丸都城, 又築國內城, 秋八月, 移居丸都城.
十三年秋七月, 移居平壤東黃城, 城在今西京東木覓山中.
이에 平壤으로서 政治의 中心地를 作하고 其後 佛敎의 傳來함을 隨하야 廣開土王 時에는 平壤에 9寺를 創하니 佛敎- 더욱 文化의 中心地가 되도다.
長壽王十五年, 移都平壤.
平原王二十八年, 移都長安城.
長壽王 15年에 平壤으로 遷都하니 平壤 大城山下 安鶴宮址가 是인듯 하도다. 平原王 28年에는 듸디어 長安城에 移都하니 即 今에 平壤城이라. 東南은 大同江을 繞하고 西方은 普通江을 帶하며 北方은 天設의 要害地로 牧丹峰이 聳立할 새 비록 小規模의 歎이 不無할지나 實로 朝鮮式의 特色을 具한 城廓이라. 高句麗의 末年은 果然 此 城에서 終하도다.
國都의 遷移가 大略 上述한 바와 如하거니와 各其 遷都 後라도 그 舊都를 不願하얏슴은 아니라. 故國原王이 丸都城과 國內城을 修築하얏스며, 더욱
二年春二月, 王如卒本, 祀始祖廟, 巡問百姓老病賑給, 三月至自卒本.
그 舊都를 慕하기 如斯하얏나니 佛敎美術의 影響을 蒙한 古墳이 國內城附近에서 發見됨으로서도 可히 推測할진저. 然而 此等 諸城中 多年間 都한 者는 琉璃王의 移都한 國內城이 約 206年間이요, 長壽王 時부터 移居한 平壤城이 約 159年이며 그와 前後하야 平壤과 平壤附近에 都한 者를 計하면 凡 300餘年에 至하도다. 故로 高句麗의 遺跡, 遺物 中 美術的 價値를 有한 者도 國內, 平壤의 2城 附近에 在하니 玆에 是等을 探究 排列하야 그의 所由來 特色 等의 史的 變遷을 考察코저 하노라.＜19＞

第1 建築
3國時代는 相戰相攻하기마지 아니하야 兵難이 相仍하니 建都築城의 業은 自然 山川의 要害를 擇하여 城壘의 堅固함을 期할새 一大發展의 域에 至하도다. 然而 歷代의 諸王은 비록 紛擾한 世代에 處하나마 佛法을 尊崇하야 此를 極盡히 保護하얏슴으로 그와 伴하야 佛寺의 創建이 多하얏스며 그 影響을 受한 諸般 建築이 또한 後世에 在하야서도 殆無한 勃興期를 作하도다.
其中 高句麗의 建築이 莊嚴하얏섯슴은 前者에 暫論한 바-어니와 海東繹史에 依하건대
勾麗王宮內有水晶城, 可方一里, 天未曉而明如畫.
水晶城의 輝煌함이 如斯하얏나니 後代 新羅의 流離를 被한 瓦片의 發見으로써 推想컨대 此城도 或은 人造의 琉璃와 如한 者로 成함이나 아니엇는가하는 想像도 不無한 바-로다. 然이나 1片 對象物이 缺한 者인즉 斷定은 尙且 早速하다 할지요. 다만 國內와 平壤 附近에서 多數 發見된 鬼瓦의 巨大함과 그 瓦上鬼面의 像形 等이 雄偉함에 依하야 地上에 建立되엇든 宮室과 樓門 等의 壯麗를 極한 者이엇슴을 推測함에 止함이 可할지로다. 地上은 已然하거니와 樂浪時代의 遺跡과 가티 地下의 營造로써 우리 高句麗의 美術도 考究케되도다. 玆에 此를 論하매 一一이 枚擧할 餘裕를 不有함으로 오즉 歷史上 發達의 徑路를 探得함에 最便한 氣質上의 特色을 顯한 者와 及 其 技巧上 特色을 具한 者를 擧하고 더욱 高句麗建築의 系統을 硏究함에 充足할 資料를 探覈하야 그 所由來를 遺物上으로 考察코저 하노라.
通溝의 西北 約 2里許에 好太王碑가 屹立하니 그 附近 數處에 巨大한 石山을 發見할지라. 이곳 將軍塚, 太王陵 等이니 今에 그中 完存된 者로 將軍塚에 就하야 觀之컨대 第一로 그 雄大奇拔한 構造에 驚嘆치 아니치 못할지요. 少焉에 愼嚴莊重한 그 氣象에 不可犯할 崇高의 美를 感하는 바- 업지 아니치 못할 라. 此 石塚은 그 近處에서 發見되는 瓦片에 蓮花紋樣이 善用듸엇슴으로써 推測하야 佛敎 傳來 後 그 初期에 屬하는 者로 認定할 새 凡 7層으로 成하니 全高가 46尺에 至하며 下層에서 上層으로 上함을 隨하야 各層의 高度가 同一한 比例로 漸次 矮低한지라. 當代의 民人이 造形美術上 比의 應用法을 善用하얏슴은 일로써 可想하겟거늘 又况 그 各層을 更히 3個의 小層으로 作하되＜20＞ 亦是 下로부터 上함을 隨하야 次第로 低小하얏슴이리오. 高句麗時代에는 如何한 名詞로써 此法을 相傳하얏는가 不可測也나 今日 形式美의 量的 法則으로 一般이 認定하는 所謂 黃金律(Golden rule)을 1步尤進하야 此를 善用하얏도다. 그 全形이 左右의 築法이 相同하야 均齊(Symmetry)를 得할 새 量美의 形式이 餘恨업시 具備되니 科學的 形式美까지도 等閑視 아니할 뿐 아니라, 反하야 數段의 進步를 旣有하얏도다.
然而 吾人은 玆에 量美의 本質에 就하야 一顧할 必要를 感하노니 即 量美에 대한 吾人의 美的 快感은 純粹한 그 形式의 合理性에 在함이 아니라. 형식이 그 中에 內在하는 理想을 具象的으로 表現한 者라고 知覺되며 觀照되는 時에 吾人은 即 形式美를 感하는 者-라. 外的 多樣은 內的 多樣을 表現함이요, 外的 統一은 內的 統一을 表現함인즉 將軍塚에 表現된 內的 理想을 形式으로부터 推察코저 하노라. 巨大한 地盤上에 雄立한 石塚은 適當한 斜面을 作하야 「마운드」의 形을 成하고 左右의 均齊를 不失하얏스며 石塚 周圍 數處에 高 約 2間餘의 大石을 立하야 石塚을 支케하고 各層의 築上이 形式美에 合하니 그는 中力의 關係上 安定을 表示하며 同時에 感하는 力美는 靜的임을 可測할지로다. 安定은 更히 巨大를 容하야 이에 確固不拔의 性을 發하며 靜적으로 感하는 力美는 更히 1,500餘年의 長久한 星霜에 幾次나 暴風慘雨와 相戰하얏스리오마는 少許나 崩頹함이 無하고 于今토록 完存하니 그 堅固强忍한 內的 活動力을 顯하고 永久라하는 時間上의 量美와 伴하야 一層 此를 切感케 하도다. 然이나 抽象的으로 此를 論할 時에 뿐 如斯한 空間에 關한 者와 時間에 關한 者를 分離함이 可能한 것이요, 實際로 將軍塚과 如한 者를 遭遇하는 時는 恒常 2者의 結合한 狀態에 在하나니 故로 內在의 力美를 一層 强大하게 感하는 者-라. 이에 吾人은 不完全하게나마 先祖의 遺物을 通하야 倍達族의 性質과 그의 All을 表現한 建築術의 進步를 可히 聯想할지로다.
高句麗는 建築上 獨特한 特色을 通有할새 石塚과 土塚을 莫論하고 內部 玄室은 擧皆 石造며 그 壁面 上隅로부터 巧妙를 盡한 持送(Corvel)을 做出하야 天井과 相連함이 卽是也라. 樂浪時代에 이미 穹窿天井을 有하얏거니와 高句麗에 至하야는 그 圓에 更히 角을 加하야 一層 進步한 持送法을 生하니 持送을 出하야 天井을 狹小케하고 그 上部 4隅에는 3角形의 持送을 築하야 狹小케하고 方向을 變한 4角形의 天井을 更出하며 그 上部 4隅에 3角形의 持送을 再築하니 天井은 益小하야지고 高度는 益加할지라. 이에 巨大한 1個 石으로써 그를 蓋하나니 果然 그 技巧는 「뻬스트」를＜21＞ 盡한 者일 새. 建築術이 發達하얏다는 今日에도 如斯한 技巧를 有한 者는 稀少함이로다. 持送을 出한 後 3角形의 持送을 更築하야 層을 作하니 安固의 狀을 可히 留하며 狹小한 天井은 尤益 高度를 加하니 氣韻에 充溢한 壁畵와 伴하야 崇高의 念을 添하도다. 當時는 「간다라」 系統의 美術을 輸入한 時代인즉 勿論 希臘美術과의 關係를 有하얏슬지나 純希臘式이라고까지는 許容키 難한 者-니 우리 美術史上의 系統은 不顧하고 오즉 一部의 形式을 看取하야 純希臘式이라고 卽座에 斷定을 下하는 者- 往往 有之나 通溝 附近에 在한 散蓮花塚, 平南 龍岡郡에 在한 龕神塚 等은 4方의 壁面이 上함을 隨하야 漸次로 內彎形을 作하고 更히 그 上에 前者와 如한 天井을 成하니 大槪 穹窿形에 近似한 者-라. 由是觀之컨대 樂浪時代에 旣有한 半圓形의 穹窿天井이 高句麗人의 創造的 天才에 依하야 그 獨特한 持送法으로 造成된 天井을 做出한 徑路를 斟酌할지니 그 原由가 我에게 本有하얏슴을 可히 妄却치 못할 者인저. 羅馬의 「판데온神殿은 西紀前 27年頃에 神聖한 諸神을 爲하야 建立한 者여니와 半圓形의 穹窿으로써 天井을 作하니 此 圓形의 屋蓋가 2,000餘年 以來로 不動함을 今日의 建築家가 稱嘆하는 바-니 朝鮮半島에도 樂浪時代에 穹窿天井을 旣有하얏섯스며 高句麗時代에 至하야는 地下의 幽室로서도 오히려 數層 進步한 形式의 天井을 于今토록 完存하니 東西兩洋의 半島美術이 相類하얏슴은 또 多趣한 一現象을 作함이엇도다. 더욱 圓으로부터 角으로, 曲線美로부터 直線美로 推移하는 傾向이 漸次로 多顯하는 今日의 美術이 또한 高句麗時代의 建築術이 變遷하얏슴과 相似하도다.
建築의 特色을 論한 吾人은 그에게 影響을 及한 「간다라」 美術과의 建築上 關係를 考究코저하노라. 平南線 眞池洞驛에서 西北 約 10餘町에 1巷의 土圓塚이 有하니 그 天井의 構造와 如함은 他와 殊異한 點이 別無하나 前後 2室 中間에 8角柱가 2個 左右에 對立할새, 是以로 此塚을 名曰 雙楹塚이라. 蓮花紋樣으로 飾한 柱頭(Capital)와 基盤(Base)을 具하며 柱身에는 蟠龍을 畫하야 他에 求得키 不能한 者-니 此가 實로 希臘美術의 傳統을 持來한 「간다라」美術의 影響이 不少하얏슴을 證하는 者-로다.
「간다라」의 建築術은 印度, 波斯, 羅馬 等의 感化도 受하얏스나 오즉 此期의 美術은 希臘佛敎式이라하야 希臘의 系統을 傳함으로 成하얏스며 此로써 唯一한 特徵을 作하얏나니 然則 希臘의 樣式을 傳하얏슬지라. 希臘建築의＜22＞ 樣式도 大槪 「도리크」(Doric)式 「아이오니크」(Ionic)式, 「코린스」(Corinth)式의 3種이 有하니 其中 「코린스」式이 最後에 生한 者-며 最優한 者-나 各各 殊異한 特色을 有할새 「도리크」式은 剛健之氣에 勝하며 「아이오니크」式은 優雅之風에 長하며 「코린스」式은 纖細之精에 秀하도다. 「간다라」에 輸入된 建築術도 此 「코린스」式이 主가 되니 「아갼사스」 「忍冬」 等의 紋樣을 刻飾한 柱頭의 賞用이 最盛하얏도다. 然而 諸形式중 纖細로 特徵을 作한 「코린스」式이 高句麗로 傳하니 當代의 民人이 確固不拔之性을 有한다하야 오즉 偉大와 雄豪뿐을 是好함이 아니엇슴을 可測할지요. 當時의 文學도 雄大한 氣象을 發하는 中에도 異趣의 傾向의 潛流가 不無하얏나니 琉璃明王의 黃鳥歌는 此를 證하도다.
翩翩黃鳥 雌雄相依 念我之獨 誰之與歸
稚姬를 失한 王의 感傷詩가 아니리요, 然이나 此는 그들의 性格上位를 占함이 果然 微弱하얏나니 乙支文德의 遺于仲文詩는 此를 表示하도다.
神策究天文 妙算窮地理 戰勝功旣高 知足願云止
이에 纖細로 特色를 作하던 「코린스」式의 柱頭도 「아갼사스」의 紋樣은 蓮辮紋樣으로 變하며 圓形의 柱身은 8角으로 化하고 柱長과 角柱의 直徑과의 比例가 前者와 異하니 勁健을 特色 삼는 高句麗의 雙楹을 做成하도다.
建築에 對하야 累累 述하얏거니와 何如컨 北方的 武風을 稟有한 北部의 倍達族이 藝術的 創造의 良心으로 自我를 表現키 爲하야 外來 美術의 模倣을 征伐한 歷史라 할지로다.
