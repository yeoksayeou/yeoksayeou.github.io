**Prize Competition/Call for Collection of Traditional Korean Folktales**

Every nation has legends, folk songs, folktales, and children's songs that are based on its national character and national life, springing forth from them. Just as the peoples of England and America have their own distinct legends and folktales, and the peoples of Germany or France also possess their own separate legends and folktales, these legends, folktales, and children's songs are based on the national character and the life of the people. Flowing out from there, they, in turn, solidify the national spirit (民族根性) and provide fresh water [nourishment]. Between these exists a relationship of mutual generation (相生) in infinite circulation. When one considers how much the famous tales of the Grimm Brothers cultivated a spirit of courage and valor (强勇性) in the German people, and how the three great famous tales of defeating demons, which could be called Britain's national folktales, cultivated tenacity (堅忍性) and conservatism (保守性) in that people, one comes to feel anew the truly great power of folktales and legends. But brothers! What do we possess now? Setting ourselves aside, what do we have to nurture the new generation growing up before us? While Korea's traditional folktales and children's songs are more sublime than anything comparable elsewhere, due to the lack of anyone paying attention (留意) to them, they have become unknowingly buried. Our new generation in the capital and countryside sings only "Moshi Moshi Kame yo" and knows only "Urashima Tarō" and "Momotarō." Ah, brothers! If we leave things as they are, what will become of our tomorrow?
Feeling this keenly, [symbol ■ missing] though our strength is meager, we have begun the task of unearthing Korea's traditional folktales, long buried in various regions, for the revival (復興) of folktale literature, the wellspring (源泉) of national thought. To accomplish this great task, we borrow the form of a prize competition to borrow the strength of our brothers in the provinces, hereby announcing it widely. Brothers with intention, do not view this the same as other kinds of competitions, but lend your strength to this valuable work.<112>

**Summary**

This article from the magazine *Kaebyŏk* announces a prize competition aimed at collecting traditional Korean folktales (朝鮮 古來의 童話). The editors express deep concern that these native stories, crucial for nurturing national character (民族性) and spirit (民族根性), are being forgotten and replaced by Japanese children's songs and tales like "Moshi Moshi Kame yo," "Urashima Tarō," and "Momotarō" among the younger generation. Arguing that folktales are vital for national identity, comparing their impact to the Grimm Brothers' tales in Germany and demon-slaying stories in Britain, the magazine calls upon readers nationwide to submit traditional Korean stories to help revive this literary wellspring. The competition, judged by Pang Chŏnghwan, offers monetary prizes and outlines rules for submission, emphasizing the need for authentic traditional tales over newly created or translated ones.

From a historical perspective, this article is significant as it reflects Korean intellectuals' anxieties about cultural assimilation under Japanese colonial rule (1910-1945) just over a decade into the occupation. The explicit naming of popular Japanese children's culture displacing Korean traditions highlights the perceived cultural threat. Historians would find this a valuable primary source illustrating early efforts towards cultural preservation and the assertion of a distinct Korean national identity through literature and folklore, framing it as a form of resistance against colonial cultural policies. The emphasis on collecting *traditional* tales (古來) and the involvement of Pang Chŏnghwan, a key figure in the Korean children's literature movement, underscore the urgency felt in preserving cultural heritage.
