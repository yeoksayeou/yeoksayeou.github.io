First Day of Dog Days on the Han River
						Sŏk Kye

One
People exist in a world like a red furnace,
Gazing at the sky, resenting the slow passage of the sun.
Drinking iced water is of no use,
To escape the heat, where does one wish to go?

Two
Walking out onto the iron bridge,
Blue waves flow beneath my feet.
Wishing to know the clear meaning,
Together with guests, I board a boat.

Three
Guests cooling off upon the river,
How they are like feathered immortals!
Calling fish to the swimming spot,
Nature and I share a natural innocence.<89>

**Summary**

This poem by Sŏk Kye describes escaping the intense summer heat of Ch'obok (the first of the three "dog days") by visiting the Han River. The poet finds relief from the oppressive heat, metaphorically a "red furnace," by going onto the "iron bridge" (likely the Han River Railway Bridge) and then boating on the river with companions. The cool river offers a sense of peace and connection with nature, likening the experience to becoming a carefree immortal, sharing innocence with the fish. From a historical perspective, the poem provides a glimpse into leisure activities in colonial Seoul (Kyŏngsŏng) in the early 1920s. The mention of the "iron bridge" highlights the developing modern infrastructure, while the act of seeking refuge and finding solace in nature reflects a personal response to the environment and perhaps an indirect escape from the broader socio-political context of the time.
