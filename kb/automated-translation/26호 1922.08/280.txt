Old Days
						Sowŏl

At the end of thought comes drowsiness,
And at the end of longing comes forgetting.

My dear, speak no more, from now on, we
Shall not know the sorrow of having no past days.<26>

**Summary**

This short poem by Sowŏl reflects on the natural fading of thoughts into drowsiness and longing into forgetfulness. The speaker addresses someone, suggesting they cease speaking, implying that from this point forward, they will no longer experience the specific sorrow associated with "having no past days" (녯낫업는 설음). This could mean either forgetting past sorrows or perhaps embracing a future unburdened by the pains of remembrance. For historians, the poem, written during the Japanese colonial period, offers a glimpse into the lyrical expression of melancholy and perhaps a subtle desire for oblivion or a break from a painful past, common themes in Sowŏl's work which resonated with the era's atmosphere. The specific phrase "sorrow of having no past days" is intriguing and could be interpreted in various ways related to memory and identity during that time.

						素月
생각의 끗에는 조름이 오고
그립음의 끗에는 니즘이 오나니,
그대여, 말을 말아라, 이後부터 우리는
녯낫업는 설음은 모르리.＜26＞
