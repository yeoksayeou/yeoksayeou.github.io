Author: None
Article Type: 잡저 (Miscellaneous writing)

Viewing the entire scene of Ch'ŏnji from the slope of Pyŏngsabong, the highest peak of Paektusan.

**Summary**

This text is a brief caption accompanying a photograph or illustration in the magazine *Gaebyeok*. It describes the view of Cheonji (Heaven Lake) as seen from the slope of Byeongsabong, identified as the highest peak of Baekdu Mountain. The text emphasizes the panoramic nature ("全景" - full view) of the scene. From a historical perspective, its publication in *Gaebyeok*, a prominent Korean cultural and nationalist magazine during the Japanese colonial period, is significant. Featuring Baekdu Mountain, a potent symbol of Korean national identity, served as a subtle form of cultural assertion and preservation of national consciousness when overt political expression was suppressed. Historians might note its role in reinforcing national symbolism through visual and descriptive media during colonial times.
