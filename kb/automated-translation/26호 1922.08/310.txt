Forgotten Heart
						Sowŏl

Having left home, far, far away,
My lonely thoughts (心思) that used to wander.

When the wind blows and spring flowers (봄꼿) bloom,
Why do you come?

You, whom both you forgot and I had forgotten,
Why do you come with that old dream (녯꿈)?

A heart that comes and goes only sorrowfully, without reason.<26>

**Summary**

This poem by Sowŏl expresses a sense of melancholy and unwelcome remembrance. The speaker reflects on a past self or relationship ("you") that had been forgotten but returns unexpectedly, like an old dream, triggered perhaps by the arrival of spring. This return brings only a sense of sorrow ("선입게만"), suggesting the past is painful or unresolved. From a historical perspective, Sowŏl's poetry, often imbued with themes of longing, loss, and the sorrow of parting ('han'), resonated deeply during the Japanese colonial period. Historians might find this poem indicative of the suppressed emotions and the poignant sense of loss – whether personal or national – experienced by Koreans during that era, where even the memory of a forgotten past brings sorrow rather than joy.

니젓든 맘
						素月
집을 떠나 먼 먼곳에
외로이도 단이든 내 心思를.
바람불어 봄꼿이 필 때에는
그대는 왜오는가,
저도 닛고 나도 니젓든 그대는
어찌하야 녯꿈과 함께 오는가
일도 업시 선입게만 오고 가는맘.＜26＞
