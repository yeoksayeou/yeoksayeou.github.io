My Love and My Friend
						Sowŏl

A friend is welcome in sorrow,
My love is good in love.

The time when strawberry blossoms are fragrantly fragrant (香氣롭게),
The night when the red fruit of the pepper ripens,
You shall call, and I shall drink.<26>

**Summary**

This short poem by Sowŏl contrasts the roles of a friend (comfort in sorrow) and a lover (joy in love). It evokes a sensory scene of summer/autumn nights, filled with the fragrance of strawberry blossoms and the sight of ripening red peppers, culminating in an image of shared intimacy where the beloved calls and the speaker drinks. From a historical perspective, the poem, written during the Japanese colonial period by one of Korea's most beloved poets, Kim Sowŏl (using his pen name 素月), is interesting for its focus on personal emotion and natural imagery specific to Korea (strawberries, peppers). While not overtly political, its lyrical expression of personal connection and appreciation for the Korean landscape can be seen as a quiet assertion of identity and a search for solace in the personal sphere during a time of national suppression.

벗은 설음에서 반갑고
