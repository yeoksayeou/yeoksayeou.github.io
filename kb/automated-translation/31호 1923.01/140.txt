Part 3: Painting of the Baekje Period

That Paekche (백제), due to its geographical location and the disposition and talents [of its people], adopted the essence (粹) of southern culture, finally shedding the cradle (搖籃) it had brought (携來) from northern Puyŏ (부여) and creating (做成) its unique art, has already been broadly outlined previously. As the culture of India (天竺) gradually advanced eastward around 500 AD, Ch'an (Zen) Buddhism began to be transmitted to China. The art of central India, via sea routes, brought about a great transformation in the art world of the Southern Liang (南梁) dynasty, and crossing the Yellow Sea again, gave no small stimulus to the painting circles of the Paekche people.

Generally, painting, which had not yet escaped (未脫) the bounds (圈線) of constrained (羈絆) art—serving merely as a means (방편) for religion, an aid to human ethics, or decoration for buildings and allegorical depiction—had already shown an increasing tendency towards realism during the Koguryŏ (고구려) period. However, reaching this Paekche period, it can be said to have almost attained a method of completely free expression. Not only were special, distinct colors added in terms of technique, but subjects (畵題) also discarded the old evils (舊弊) of convention, arbitrarily expanding boundaries, and it seems attention (意) was paid to the selection of key points (契點). This is where the budding (崩芽) of free art first appeared (顯出), and along with its sculpture, it testifies to the changes in the aesthetic thought of the Paedal (배달) people. As for painters (畵師):

Insaraa (因斯羅我)
During the time of Emperor Yūryaku (雄略帝) of Fusang (扶桑國; Japan), he crossed over to Japan along with various other artisans and took charge of the painting department (畵部). This was before the revival of Paekche Buddhism, thus naturally a time before Buddhism had been transmitted to Japan, preceding Koguryŏ's Tamjing (曇徵) by about 150 years. He is the first painter whose name is recorded in the peninsula. However, since this is merely a fragmentary fact, there is no way to historically verify (고증) its historical connections, making it difficult to attach any comprehensive explanation. <15>

Paekka (白加)
Later, in the 34th year of King Widŏk (威德王), when Paekche temple builders (寺工) and tile makers (瓦匠) who built Shitennō-ji (四天王寺) in Nanba (難波; Naniwa) crossed over to Japan, the painter Paekka (白加) accompanied them. He likely painted murals and Buddhist images, further adding splendor (輪奐之美) to that temple. He became the originator (鼻祖) who transmitted the methods of Buddhist painting to Japan.

Aja (阿佐)
A prince of Paekche, his name is known because he painted a portrait of Prince Shōtoku (聖德太子) of Fusang (扶桑國; Japan). Japanese historical records state:
"In the summer of the 5th year of Suiko (推古五年夏四月), Prince Aja (阿佐) of Paekche came to court. Privately speaking to an official at the lodging (私於舘人), he requested to see the Prince [Shōtoku], saying, 'Having long heard of your sacred name, my desire to behold you is fulfilled.' He was then summoned into the palace hall. Aja saw the Prince, knelt on the ground in the courtyard, joined his hands, and recited a gāthā. The Prince said, 'This person was formerly my disciple, thus he has come to express gratitude.'"
"Hearing this, the Prince led him directly into the hall. Aja, astonished, bowed. He looked closely (熟見) at the Prince's face, then again at his right and left palms, and right and left foot soles. He rose and bowed twice more in two stages, then retreated and exited to the courtyard. Placing his right knee on the ground (右膝着地), he joined his hands respectfully and said, 'I respectfully salute the Savior Avalokiteśvara (敬禮救世觀音)...'"
"Portrait of Prince Shōtoku, stored at Hōryū-ji (法隆寺) in Yamato Province (大和國). This is a portrait painted by the Paekche King's envoy, Aja, while paying respects to the Prince."
Copies (模寫) are transmitted in various places, but viewed from an aesthetic value perspective, it seems to be an extremely rudimentary realistic painting compared to Tamjing's Hōryū-ji murals. However, as a realistic portrait, it is the first seen in our art history, and along with Silla's (新羅) Solgŏ (率居), who created a new era in our realistic painting, it is sufficient to allow us to clearly infer (推想) the changes in painting.

Hasŏng (河成)
He is the one who brought the gradually flourishing realistic painting to a great accomplishment (大成), marking a milestone. According to records, he died during the time of Emperor Monmu (文德帝) of Fusang (Japan). Thus, it might be more appropriate to attribute him to the Unified Silla (新羅統一) period rather than the Paekche period, but since his predecessors were Paekche people and he inherited the Paekche painting style, for us, who are not dealing with Paekche political history per se, calling him a late Paekche artist seems more suitable than assigning him to the Unified Silla period, which, though contemporaneous, has no direct connection. A Japanese historical record says:
"San'i, Junior Fifth Rank, Kudara no Asomi Kasei (河成) died. Kasei's original surname was Yŏ (余), later changed to Kudara (百濟). He excelled in martial prowess and could draw a strong bow. In the 3rd year of Daidō (大同三年), he became a member of the Left Inner Palace Guard (左近衛). Because he was skilled at painting (善圖畵), he was repeatedly summoned (屢被召見) for audiences. The portraits of ancient figures and landscapes, plants, etc., that he painted were all lifelike (目生). Once, while in the palace, someone was ordered to summon an attendant. That person declined, saying they had not seen the attendant's face. Kasei immediately took a piece of paper and drew his form and body. The person was then able to identify him. His skill and ingenuity (機妙) were of this kind. Those who speak of painting today all take him as a model."
The story of summoning the attendant using a drawing (畵圖) has similar legends recorded elsewhere; some say that when searching for the attendant in the market using the drawing, not the slightest difference could be found. Although there might be some exaggeration, it greatly praises Hasŏng's <16> skill in realistic depiction (寫生). It is said that Fang Deng (方等), grandson of Emperor Wu of Liang (梁武帝), could depict the appearances of guests at a gathering so accurately that children could identify each one, and that Zhang Sengyou (張僧繇) satisfied Emperor Wu's wish to visualize the face of his son on a military expedition by painting his portrait. Hasŏng's brush, however, was sufficient for finding a person. Also, the story that when comparing skills with the Hida artisan (飛彈工), he painted the form of a dead person, bloated and putrid (脹爛), appearing to emit a foul stench that struck the nose, causing the opponent to cry out in alarm and retreat, was something endlessly praised (稱嘆키 不已하얏든 바) by contemporaries. This is commonly known and need not be elaborated upon here. His mature realistic painting finally (듸디어) reached this level.

That he depicted a disgusting, bloated, and putrid corpse means that, setting aside the subject matter (畵題), the painting method must have been somewhat different from the conventional focus on demonstrating the wonder of brushwork (運筆之妙). This is something that cannot be overlooked. Just as Zhang Sengyou's "concave-convex painting" (凹凸畵), that is, his shading technique (음영법), received the influence of Western Regions art, it seems that Paekche's realistic painting, following frequent exchanges with Liang (梁), was considerably influenced by him. The "boneless" texture stroke (沒骨皴) pioneered by Zhang Sengyou was a method that did not first use ink brushstrokes for outlining and polishing (鉤硏), but rather gradually applied colors like blue-green or cinnabar appropriately to create form. This influence is slightly apparent (稍顯) in Tamjing's Hōryū-ji murals, and Hasŏng's painting of the corpse was likely even closer to this style. Although works occasionally transmitted to this day are claimed to be the extant ink paintings (遺墨) of Paekche's Hasŏng, examining their painting style makes them difficult to believe, so they are omitted here.

Indeed, Paekche painting was the vanguard of art reform during the Three Kingdoms period, establishing the banner (旗標) of realistic painting and adding the technique of the newly arrived shading method. Herein lies its unique characteristic found nowhere else, and herein resides its precious value.

**Summary**

This article, part of a series on Korean art history, focuses on painting during the Baekje period. The author, Pak Chonghong, argues that Baekje painting, influenced by Southern Liang Chinese art (which itself absorbed Indian influences), moved beyond earlier constraints towards greater realism and freedom of expression. Several painters are discussed, including Insaraa, Paekka, Prince Aja, and Hasŏng, highlighting their roles, particularly in transmitting artistic styles and techniques (like Buddhist painting and portraiture) to Japan (Fusang). Hasŏng is presented as a key figure who perfected realistic painting, possibly employing shading techniques influenced by Chinese artists like Zhang Sengyou. The article emphasizes Baekje painting's unique contribution to the development of realism in Korean art. From a colonial history perspective, the article is interesting for its assertion of a distinct Korean artistic trajectory (Baekje's unique style emerging from Puyŏ roots and Southern Chinese influence), its detailed account of cultural transmission to Japan (positioning Korea/Baekje as a cultural source), and the author's effort to situate Korean art within East Asian history while claiming its specific achievements, like the early development of realism potentially paralleling Chinese advancements. Historians might find the specific artists and anecdotes discussed, the framing of cultural influence (India -> China -> Baekje -> Japan), and the nationalistic undertones in defining a unique Baekje/Korean artistic identity during the colonial period of particular interest.

百濟時代의 彫刻, 朝鮮美術의 史的 考察 其十
						朴鍾鴻
제 3 百濟時代의 繪畫
백제가 그 지리의 위치상 관계로서, 또는 기질과 재능의 관계로서 남방적 문물의 粹를 採하야 드듸어 북방 扶餘로부터 携來하얏든 그 搖籃을 脫하고 독특한 그 미술을 做成하얏슴은 前者에 간단하게나마 대의를 擧하엿거니와 天竺의 문화가 서기 500년경에 점차 東으로 進함을 隨하야 중국에 선종이 비롯오 전하얏고 중부 인도의 예술이 海路를 經하야 南梁의 미술계에 일대변혁을 生케 하엿스며 다시 황해를 越하야 백제인의 회화계에 不少한 刺激을 與하얏도다.
대개 종교의 방편이 아니면 인륜의 보조 혹은 건축물 등의 장식과 우의적 묘사로 尙且 羈絆예술의 圈線을 未脫하얏든 회화는 고구려 시대에 在하야 이미 사실적 경향이 逐下 증가함을 見하얏섯스나 此 백제시대에 至하야 幾乎 완전한 자유롭은 표현의 법을 득하얏다 칭할지니 기교상에 특수한 異彩를 加하얏슴은 물론이요. 畵題와 如한 것도 인습의 舊弊를 捨하야 임의로 한계를 확대하고 契點의 선택 등에도 意를 留함인 듯 하도다. 자유예술의 崩芽가 비롯오 顯出한 者―며 그의 조각과 더불어 또한 배달족의 심미적 사상의 변천을 證하는 者―로다. 畵師로는 일즉
因斯羅我 扶桑雄略帝時에 諸他 공예가와 더불어 渡日하야 畵部의 任을 擔하엿섯도다. 백제의 불교가 再興하기 이전인 즉 물론 일본에 불법이 傳치 못하얏든 시대요 인하야 고구려의 曇徵보다 先하기 약 150년 전이라. 반도에 畵師로 그 名을 전하는 최초가 되도다. 然而此는 일부의 단편적 사실에 불과하는 者임으로 그 역사적 관계에 至하야는 고증의 策이 無하니써 종합한 하등의 설명도 附키 難한 者―로다.＜15＞
白如 그 후 威德王 34년에 難波의 四天王寺를 建한 백제의 寺工, 瓦匠 등이 渡日할 시, 畵師 白如가 동반하얏슨 즉 벽화와 불상 등을 寫하야 일층 그 사찰로 하야금 輪奐의 美를 加케 하얏슬 것이요. 일본에 불화의 법을 전한 鼻祖가 되도다.
阿佐 백제의 왕자로 扶桑國聖德太子의 像을 寫하얏슴으로 그 名을 전하니 日本史書에 記호되
推古五年夏四月, 百濟王子阿佐來朝, 私於舘人, 請見太子曰, 久聞聖名, 拜觀意足矣, 乃召殿內, 佐見太子, 下庭跪地, 合掌說偈, 太子曰, 此人昔爲我徒, 故來謝耳.
太子聞之, 直引殿內, 阿佐驚拜, 熟見太子之顔, 復左右手掌, 左右足掌, 再起再拜兩段, 退而出庭, 右膝着地, 合掌恭敬曰, 敬禮救世觀音云云.
大和國法隆寺藏, 聖德太子像, 百濟國王使阿佐, 乍拜太子所寫像也.
도처에 그 模寫가 전하나 심미적 가치로서 觀之하면 曇徵의 法隆寺 벽화에 비하야 극히 유치한 사실화인 듯 하도다. 然이나 사생적 인물화로는 우리 미술사상에 始見하는 바―니 우리 사생화에 新紀元을 作한 新羅 率居와 더불어 회화의 변천을 역력히 推想케 함에 足한 者―라.
河成 漸盛하는 사실화를 大成하야 일단락을 作한 者―라. 기록에 의하면 扶桑文德帝時에 卒하얏다 하엿슨 즉 百濟시대라함 보다도 차라리 新羅統一시대에 屬케 함이 타당할 것이로되 그 先이 백제인으로 백제의 화법을 전승한지라. 일개 백제의 정치사를 취급하는 吾人이 아닌 이상 백제 말기의 미술가라 함이 시대는 同하나 관계함이 無한 신라통일시대에 편입함보다 可할지로다. 日本史書에 云,
散位從五位百濟朝臣河成卒. 河成本姓余, 後改百濟, 長於武猛, 能引强弓. 大同三年爲左近衛, 以善圖畵屢被召見, 所寫古人眞及山水草木等, 皆如目生. 昔在宮中, 令或人喚從者, 或人辭以未見顔容, 河成卽取一紙, 圖其形軆, 或人遂驗得, 其機妙類如此. 今之言畵者, 咸取則焉.
그 從者를 喚함에 畵圖로써 하얏다 함은 此外에도 유사한 전설을 載함이 有하니 혹이 그 畵圖로써 시장에 從者를 訪할 새 추호도 異點을 발견치 못하얏섯다 云하도다. 다소 誇大의 辭가 無함은 아닐지나 자못 河成의 寫生에 長하얏슴을＜16＞ 讚하는 바―로다. 梁武帝의 孫, 方等은 座上賓客의 相貌를 描出할 새 童兒가 皆皆이 지시함을 득하얏섯다 하며 張僧繇는 外征에 出한 왕자의 像을 傳寫하야 면목을 想見코저 한 武帝의 意를 만족케 하얏섯다 하거니와 河成의 筆은 人을 搜함에 가히 足케 하얏섯도다. 또 飛彈工과 기능을 相較할 時에 脹爛하야 正히 악취가 衝鼻하는 듯한 死人의 形을 寫하야 對者로 하야금 경악의 聲을 발하며 퇴거케 하얏다 함은 時人의 稱嘆키 不已하얏든 바―요. 此에 특별되게 열거치 아니하야도 共知하는 바―라. 그 원숙한 사실화는 듸디어 此에까지 及하얏다.
醜汚脹爛한 시체를 描出하얏섯슨 즉 畵題는 姑捨 물론이요 화법이 대개 종래의 運筆의 妙를 顯코저 함과 稍異하얏슴에 想至할지니 此는 가히 간과치 못할 바―라. 張僧繇의 凹凸畵 즉 그의 음영법이 서역미술의 감화를 受하얏슴과 가티 梁과 교통이 빈번함을 隨하야 백제의 사실화는 그에게 영향됨이 不少한 듯 하도다. 張僧繇의 창시한 바―沒骨皴은 그 법이 爲先 筆墨으로써 鉤硏함이 아니요 청록이나 朱 등의 색채로써 점차 적당하게 染出하는 者―라. 이에 曇徵의 法隆寺 벽화에서 그 영향이 稍顯하얏고 더욱 河成이 此屍人의 畵가 일층 그와 近似한 者이엇슬지로다. 백제 河成의 遺墨이라하야 간혹 세상에서 금일까지 傳함이 不無하되 그 화법 등으로 考하야 또한 信키 難한 者임으로 此에는 略하노라.
과연 백제의 회화는 삼국 시대 미술 개혁의 선구로 사실화의 旗標를 立하며 新來한 음영법의 기교를 加하얏섯나니 此에 곳 他에 無한 특색이 有한 바―며 귀중한 가치가 存하는 바―로다.
