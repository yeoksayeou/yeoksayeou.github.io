◇The Chosŏn Personnel Directory is called a Non-Personnel Ruined Trust Record

The Japanese-language newspaper company, Chosŏn Sinmunsa (朝鮮新聞社), once announced the pre-order publication of a volume called the "Chosŏn Personnel Directory" (朝鮮人事興信錄), priced at six won payable in advance. When initially soliciting pre-orders, they went around to various newspaper and magazine companies run by Koreans, using honeyed words to promise that they would accurately list the company's purpose, history, and other personnel details, introducing them to the public. Those who heard this trusted the Chosŏn Sinmunsa, and many applied, thinking it might serve as their own advertisement. However, about a year passed, and among the actual copies distributed, not only were the personnel details not registered, and the advance payment not returned, but when questioned about the situation, they reportedly engaged in defiant trickery (螢雪), saying this and that nonchalantly. There are quite a few people crying out in complaint. For those who boast of having the credibility of a major newspaper, shaking their heads and rolling their eyes (搖頭轉目), isn't it truly a case of being penny-wise and pound-foolish (貧大失), focusing on small sums of money (貧信) while disregarding the larger loss of trust? It seems fitting to retitle the "Personnel Directory" (人事興信錄) as the "Non-Personnel Ruined Trust Record" (非人事亡信錄).<82>

**Summary**

This article is a complaint against the Japanese-run newspaper company, Chosŏn Sinmunsa, for failing to deliver on its promise regarding a publication called the "Chosŏn Personnel Directory." The company collected advance payments from Korean businesses and individuals with the promise of inclusion, but many were omitted from the final product without receiving refunds. Furthermore, the company responded dismissively and deceptively to inquiries. The author criticizes the company's dishonesty and breach of trust, suggesting the directory's name should be changed to reflect its failure and deception. For historians, this piece offers insight into the business practices of Japanese enterprises targeting Koreans in the colonial era, highlighting instances of perceived exploitation and broken trust. It reflects Korean grievances regarding unfair treatment and the unreliability of promises made by entities associated with the colonial power structure, particularly within the media landscape.

◇朝鮮人事興信錄이 非人事亡信錄이라고
日字紙朝鮮新聞社에서는 所謂朝鮮人事興信錄이라는 一部先金六圓定價의 豫約出版物을 發行한적이 잇섯다. 처음 豫約募集할 에 朝鮮人이 經營하는 各新聞社雜誌社로 돌아단이면서 꿀가튼 말로써 그 社의 目的沿革과 其他人事를 틀림업시 登載하야 一般에게 紹介한다하엿다 듯는이들은 朝鮮新聞社를 信用하고 自家의 廣告나 될가하야 應募한이 가만히 잇섯다 그런지 一年이나 지나서 配附된 實物가운대에는 人事를 登錄하야주지도 안코 先納한돈도 返送치 안흘 아니라 그리된 內容을 質問하면 돌이어 멀정하게 엇더니엇더니하는 反抗的의 螢雪을 弄한다고 不平을 불으짓는 사람이 적지 안타 제말로 大新聞의 信用을 가젓노라고 誇張하야 搖頭轉目하는 者로서 적은 金錢을 貧信하야 큰 用小을 돌아보지 안는 것이 참말로 貧大失이 아니냐 人事興信錄을 改題하야 非人事亡信錄이라하면 正當할듯하다＜82＞
