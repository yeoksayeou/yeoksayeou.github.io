Article Title: 假의 □□撲揻 (Striking Down the □□ of Hypocrisy)
Author: [Not Provided]
Article Type: 세태비평 (Critique of the Times/Social Commentary)

**Body Text Translation:**
Constantly watch the movements (働靜) of all individuals or groups whose outwardly displayed slogans (標榜) and inwardly hidden schemes (計策) are not the same. Then, carry out the swift action of striking them down (撲揻速働). First of all, strip off the gold foil (金箔) of the so-called gentlemen types (紳士輩) of empty reputation (虛名), who are like dog dung (개) in a silk pouch, and make them correct the habit of wanting to work by making such crowds their leaders (首頭).<76>

**Summary**

The article forcefully calls on readers to be vigilant against hypocrisy in individuals and groups, urging them to observe discrepancies between outward appearances and inner motives. It demands swift action to expose and "strike down" this falsehood, starting with stripping the superficial prestige ("gold foil") from pretentious "gentlemen" likened to "dog dung in a silk pouch," and correcting the societal habit of following such unworthy leaders. From a historical perspective, this piece is interesting as a sharp social critique published during the Japanese colonial period. It reflects deep disillusionment with certain segments of the elite, possibly collaborators or those perceived as self-serving, and voices a strong, albeit veiled, call for societal purification and rejection of false leadership, a sentiment potentially relevant to nationalist or social reform movements of the time.
