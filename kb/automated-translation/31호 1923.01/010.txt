The New Year is a Joyful Year

With what words shall we first exchange greetings for the New Year? There is an old saying (넷말) that one word is heavier than a thousand pieces of gold, but is there truly one word more precious than a thousand pieces of gold for us?

Have your paddy ridges been tended?
Is your hammer (마치) lifted?
Tend the paddy ridges!
Lift the hammer!

This is what we want to say. What we want to encourage. Who was it that called the New Year a joyful year? When you face it, it's just the same gloomy (습습한) year. However, if we truly do this, the New Year will be a joyful year. A year more joyful than any other.

**Summary**

This editorial from the January 1923 issue of *Kaebyŏk* magazine uses the New Year not just for celebration, but as a call to action. Instead of passive greetings, it urges readers to engage in practical, diligent work – metaphorically represented by tending paddy ridges and lifting hammers. It acknowledges the potential for the New Year to feel just like the last ('gloomy'), but argues that true joy comes from active effort and labor, making the year genuinely "joyful." For historians, this piece is interesting as it reflects a pragmatic, perhaps nationalistic, spirit during the Japanese colonial period, emphasizing self-reliance and hard work ("tend the paddy ridges, lift the hammer") as the path to a better future, rather than relying solely on hope or external factors. The slightly melancholic acknowledgement that the New Year might just be the 'same gloomy year' hints at the difficult realities faced by Koreans at the time.

새해는 깃븐 해
무엇으로써 새해에 처음 사괴는 인사를 할가. 一言이 千金보다 重하다는 넷말이 잇스나 우리에게 千金보다 貴重한 一言이 잇슬가.

그대의 논두렁은 다스려젓느냐
그대의 마치는 들리어 잇느냐
논두렁을 거르라
마치를 들어라

우리는 이러케 말하고 십다. 激勵하고 십다. 누가 새해를 깃븐 해이라 하던고. 當하고 보면 마챤가지의 습습한 해. 그러나 우리가 眞實로 이리만 하면 새해는 깃븐 해. 어느 해 보다도 더 깃븐 해.
