**Body Text Translation:**
White Snow
						Kim An-sŏ
(I offer this poem to the nameless grass by the roadside)

Snow that falls even upon the soul (魂) of the departed beloved.
Snow that comes even upon the lost grave of love.
Snow that pours down even upon the flower of a young heart.
Snow that comes even in the dream of a mid-June nap.

Snow that melts even at the tip of a soft hand when touched.
Snow that extinguishes even the rising fire when covered.
Snow that cannot resist at all when trodden upon.
Snow that, though cold, is endlessly soft.

Beloved, you are snow, snow is you.
Heart, you are snow, snow is you. <103>

**Summary**

This lyrical poem by Kim An-sŏ portrays white snow as a gentle, pervasive, yet fragile entity. It falls indiscriminately on souls, graves, young hearts, and even dreams, symbolizing its reach over life, death, memory, and imagination. The snow is soft and yielding, melting at a touch and offering no resistance, yet it possesses the power to cover and extinguish fire. The poet directly equates the snow first with a beloved ("님") and then with the heart ("맘"), suggesting themes of pure, perhaps lost, love, memory, and inner feeling, characterized by both coldness and tenderness. From a historical perspective, the dedication to "nameless grass" and the melancholic, subdued tone might reflect the atmosphere of the colonial period, possibly hinting at collective sorrow or resilience found in humble, overlooked existences. The equation of the transient, pure snow with a lost beloved ("님") could resonate with themes of loss—personal or national—prevalent during that era.

흰눈
						金岸曙
(이 時를 길가의 無名草에게 들이노라)
죽은 님의 넉(魂) 우에도 내려오는 눈.
사랑의 일허진 무덤 우에도 오는 눈.
어린 맘의 꼿 우에도 내려붓는 눈.
한 6월의 낫잠의 꿈에도 오는 눈.

닥치면 보들압은 손 끗에도 녹는 눈.
덥흐면 닐어나는 불도 꺼치게 하는 눈.
지려 밟으면 아못 저항도 못하는 눈.
차기는 하여도 限업시 보들압은 눈.

님이어, 당신은 눈, 눈은 당신.
맘이어, 당신은 눈, 눈은 당신. ＜103＞
