A Few Things Heard and Seen During the Chinese Revolution
						By Han Tonghae in Beijing

Twelve years ago from now, in the autumn of the Shinhai (辛亥) year [1911], the revolutionary turmoil in China erupted like wildfire from all directions. This humble person (不佞) did not view this as a fire across the bank [someone else's problem], but realized it was something that absolutely had to be aided. As this humble person was originally a member of the medical field, I resolutely proceeded to Sanghae (上海) and threw myself into the Red Cross Corps (赤十字隊), serving in the army for nearly half a year between the Yangja River (楊子江) and the Hwangha River (黃河). Therefore, I hereby introduce one or two things I saw and heard during that time.

(1) The Righteous Contribution of a Seven-Year-Old Girl
When the revolution began, financial difficulties were unavoidable, so various groups in Sanghae were collecting patriotic donations. One day, during a street speech, a girl appearing to be about seven years old listened to the speech, then suddenly leaped out from the crowd, righteously opened her pouch, and contributed, saying, "My parents gave me one silver Yuan for snack money. Although this money is small, please use it to supplement the military funds." At that time, all the listeners were moved by this and vied to be the first to open their own pouches.

(2) The Women's Army Goes to Battle
One day on Sanghae's Da Ma Lu [Great Horse Road, likely Nanjing Road], several hundred members of the Women's Army (娘子軍), with cut hair, military attire (薙髮戎裝), pretty faces, and delicate steps (花容蓮步), advanced in neat ranks (隊伍整齊하게), blowing trumpets (喇叭) and singing military songs loudly. I heard they were going to fight at the Chin'gang (鎭江) front.

(3) Villagers Throwing Down Hoes to Join the Army
The reason the Chinese revolutionary army is called the People's Army (民軍) is none other than that originally, upon hearing of the outbreak of revolutionary war, village farmers all abandoned their plows and hoes (犂鋤) in the fields and joined the army. At that time, many in the People's Army wore cloth towels (布巾) on their heads and straw sandals (草鞋) on their feet as they carried guns (擔銃) and went out to battle.

(4) The Bloody Battle of a Sixteen-Year-Old Boy Hero
When the combined armies of various provinces were capturing Namgyŏng (南京), suddenly a young warrior of about sixteen (年約二八) rushed into the enemy camp alone on horseback with a single spear (匹馬單鎗), cut off an enemy's head (首級), and <75> presented it to the People's Army.

(5) Pigtail-Wearing People Voluntarily Cutting Their Hair
Until the end (歲腦지는) of the Shinhai year [1911], residents within Namgyŏng castle who had cut their hair (剪髮) were very few (幾希하더니). However, on the first day of the first year of the Republic of China (中華民國元年元日) [January 1, 1912], provisional president Son Mun (孫文) sternly commanded (申飭하야) the military and police, ordering that all people must cut their hair within a three-day limit (三日爲限). Consequently, many people of the entire city voluntarily desired to cut their hair, so the surgical scissors used by our Red Cross Corps were busily used for cutting hair. Within three days, there was almost no one left in the entire city wearing a pigtail (辮髮).

(6) Qing Soldiers Firing Blanks
Since Han people (漢人) originally constituted the vast majority among the Qing soldiers (淸兵), when the Hanyang (漢陽) campaign first began, the Han people in the Qing army ranks, unable to bear fighting their brothers, often fired blank shots (虛彈) into the air. Because of this, the People's Army reportedly achieved considerable (頗히) victories.

(7) Bandits Offering Their Services to the People's Army
When I was leading the Red Cross Corps towards the Sŏan (西安) front in Sŏmsi Province (陝西省), while traveling through Hanam Province (河南省), we encountered bandits (土匪) at Hyŏpsŏk Mountain (陜石山), located ninety li east of Hyŏpchu (陜州). While detained in the bandits' mountain stronghold for three days, one of our corps members explained the reasons for the southern People's Army uprising. The bandit leader then said, "Our ancestors originally resented the Qing soldiers overthrowing (顚瀆시키고) the Myŏng Dynasty (明朝) and becoming masters of the Central Plains (中原). They took this place as their base and have been settled (屯居한지) here for over two hundred years. Generation after generation (生生世世로), we have constantly hoped for the restoration of the Myŏng Dynasty. Now, hearing your words that the People's Army has risen in the south, we too shall henceforth offer our services (投效) to the People's Army."

**Summary**

This article recounts seven brief anecdotes witnessed by the author, Han Tonghae, a Korean doctor who served with the Red Cross in China during the 1911 Xinhai Revolution. The anecdotes illustrate various aspects of the revolution: popular patriotic fervor (a young girl's donation), the participation of women (a women's army unit), the peasant origins of the revolutionary soldiers, individual heroism, the symbolic act of cutting queues enforced by the new Republic, conflicted loyalties within the Qing army (Han soldiers firing blanks), and even bandits joining the revolutionary cause out of long-held anti-Qing sentiment. For historians, the article offers a valuable contemporary Korean perspective on the Chinese Revolution. The author's presence and participation highlight transnational connections and interest among Koreans in revolutionary movements during Japan's colonial rule over Korea. The specific details about popular mobilization, the symbolism of cutting queues, and the diverse groups supporting the revolution provide vivid ground-level observations.

中國革命時의 聞見一二
						在北京 韓東海
距今十二年前, 辛亥秋間에 中國의 革命亂事가 四方에서 불가티 일어낫더라. 不佞은 이것을 隔岸의 火로 보자아니하고 이불을 반듯이 救하여야 될 것을 覺悟하엿슴으로 不佞이 原來, 醫界의 一分子이기 문에 飄然히 上海에 前卦하야 몸을 赤十字隊에 投하야 거의 半年의 歲月을 楊子江과 밋 黃河의 사이에 從軍하엿다. 그럼으로 그동안 所見
所聞의 一二를 들어 玆에 紹介하노라.
(一)七歲少女의 慷慨助餉 革命이 일어나자 財政의 困難을 免할 수 업는 닭에 上海各團體에서 愛國捐을 募集할세 一日은 街上演說을 할지음에 어떤 七歲可量되는 一少女가 그 演說을 듯더니 문득 人叢中으로부터 躍出하야 慷慨히 囊을 解하야 捐助하면서 하는 말이 나의 父母가 나에게 點心費로써 銀一元을 준 것이 잇스니 이 돈이 비록 적으나 軍餉에 補充하라함으로 그 에 一般聽衆은 모도다 此에 感動되어 爭先解囊하더라.
(二)娘子軍의 出陣 一日은 上海大馬路上에서 娘子軍數百名이 薙髮戎裝과 花容蓮步로 喇叭을 불고 軍歌를 高唱하면서 隊伍整齊하게 前進하는데 들으니 鎭江前敵에 出戰한다더라.
(三)村民의 投鋤從戎 中國革命軍을 民軍이라 稱함은 다름이 아니라 原來, 村野農民으로써 一旦에 革命戰爭의 일어남을 듯고 모도다, 田間에서 犂鋤를 棄하고 從軍함인 닭인데 그 에 民軍의 裝束은 頭에 布巾을 戴하고 足에 草鞋를 穿한대로 擔銃出戰한 者-多하더라.
(四)十六歲인 少年英雄의 血戰 各省聯合軍이 南京을 攻陷할 에 忽地에 年約二八인 少年勇士가 匹馬單鎗으로 敵陣中에 突入하야 敵의 首級을 斬하야＜75＞ 民軍에 獻하엿다더라.
(五)辮髮人民의 自願斷髮 辛亥年歲腦지는 南京城內의 住民으로써 剪髮한 者-幾希하더니 中華民國元年元日에 臨時大總統孫文이 軍警을 申飭하야 三日爲限하고 人民을 一齊히 斷髮케 하기를 命令하엿슴으로 因하야 全城人民들이 만히 斷髮하기를 自願함으로 余의 赤十字隊에서 쓰는 外科剪刀를 부지럽시 剪髮하는데 使用하게 되엇나니라. 그런데 三日以內에 全城內에 辮髮한 者-거의 一人도 無하더라
(六)淸兵의 虛彈射擊 淸兵中에 原來, 漢人이 大多數임으로 漢陽戰役이 처음으로 始作될 에 淸兵陣中에 잇는 漢人은 兄弟의 相爭함을 不忍하야 만히 虛彈으로써 空中을 向하야 射擊한 닭으로 民軍이 頗히 勝利를 得하엿다더라.
(七)土匪의 投效民軍 余가 赤十字隊를 率하고 陝西省西安前敵에 赴할세 歷路中河南省陜州를 距한 東九十里에 在한 陜石山에서 土匪를 맛나 三日동안을 土匪의 山寨中에 拘留되어잇슬 에 隊岡一人이 南方民軍의 起義한 理由를 說明하매 土匪首領의 말이 우리들 祖先이 原來, 淸兵이 明朝를 顚瀆시키고 中原에 入主함을 憤慨히 녀기어 此地를 根據로 삼고 屯居한지 于今二百餘年이 되도록 生生世世로 恒常明朝의 復興함을 期待하엿더니 이제 君等의 말을 들으매 民軍이 南方에서 起義한다하니 五等도 從此로 民軍에 投效하겟다하더라.
