**Body Text Translation**
Letter from Berlin

I received your gracious letter (惠函) dated the 15th and learned that you, esteemed elder brother, are well (錦安) and that all friends are also well (一安). As for myself, the feeling of being away from home (客味) remains as before (如前), and recently, due to the drastic fall (暴落) of the German Mark (德貨), things are uneasy left and right (左右가 不安). In May of this year, one British Pound (英貨一磅) was about 1,500 or 1,600 Marks, but since August, it has fallen precipitously (下絶히 落價), reaching 35,000 Marks per British Pound just the other day. One British Pound is roughly 9 Won (圓) 80 Chŏn (錢); what has happened? Are there still people in our home country (本國) wanting to buy German Marks these days? Please give me some advice. Also, regarding the matter you entrusted (付託) to me, the timing is now too late, so I cannot comply (不應). Mr. Yi Kwan'yong (李灌鎔氏) departed on the 4th of this month on his way back home via America (米國). He is the first fruit (果實) of the students studying abroad in Europe (歐洲). That is all.

November 17th
Your younger brother (弟), Pak Sŭngch'ŏl (朴勝喆), respectfully bows again (再拜)

To Mr. Kim Kich'ŏn (金起遷 大兄)

**Summary**

This short letter, sent from Berlin by Pak Sŭngch'ŏl to Kim Kich'ŏn at the Kaebyŏk Publishing Company in Seoul, describes the severe hyperinflation of the German Mark in late 1922, with its value plummeting against the British Pound. Pak asks for advice on whether there is still interest in buying Marks back in Korea. He also mentions being unable to fulfill a previous request due to timing and reports that Yi Kwan'yong, heralded as the "first fruit" among Koreans studying in Europe, has begun his journey home via the United States. For historians, the letter provides a valuable first-hand Korean perspective on the economic chaos of Weimar Germany, illustrates the practical concerns (currency exchange) faced by early Korean students abroad, and highlights the nascent trend of Koreans pursuing higher education in Europe during the colonial period, framing Yi Kwan'yong's return as a significant milestone.
