**Summary**

This article from January 1923 provides a digest of news events occurring between November 21 and December 17, 1922, covering both Korea and international affairs. Korean news includes arrests of magazine publishers (Paek Taejin of *Sinch'ŏnji*, Pak Hŭido of *Sinsaenghwal*) and Taejonggyo leaders, labor strikes (rickshaw pullers, shoemakers), clashes between Korean and Japanese workers in Japan, the formation of student and labor groups, the visit and flight of pioneering aviator An Ch'angnam, the abolition of travel permits for Koreans going abroad, and arrests related to independence movement fundraising in Kyŏngsangbuk-do. International news covers diplomatic conferences (Near East Conference, London Conference), political changes (new cabinets/leaders in China, Greece, Poland; resignation in China), social issues (British unemployment, Canadian immigration restrictions, French suffrage defeat), military reductions (Japan, Soviet Union), international relations (Soviet protests, Britain-Greece tensions), and significant events like the Polish President's assassination and the Irish Free State's establishment.

For historians, this article is valuable as it encapsulates the socio-political atmosphere of early colonial Korea within a global context. It highlights the tight control over the press (arrests of publishers), growing labor consciousness and unrest (strikes, clashes), nationalist activities (Taejonggyo arrests, independence fundraising, An Ch'angnam's reception), and the tangible impact of Japanese colonial policies (revised laws, travel permits). Juxtaposing Korean events with international news like the rise of communism, post-WWI diplomacy, and nationalist movements elsewhere provides context for understanding Korean aspirations and challenges during this period.
