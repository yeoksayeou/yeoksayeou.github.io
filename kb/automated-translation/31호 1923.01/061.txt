壬戌歲暮의 八面觀 (Eight Views of the Year-End in the Imsul Year)
						春坡 (Ch'unp'a)

一, 南北村의 氣外分 (Atmosphere of the North and South Villages)
Anytime the year-end comes, it's a fact that all aspects of society, east, west, south, and north, take on a special vitality. Whether it's the bustle of the marketplace or the tension among people, everything shows a special boom beyond ordinary times. That's because it's the time for settling the accounts of human life for the entire year.

However, the end of the Imsul year (1922) seems not to be like that. It is very desolate. Like the season of falling leaves, everything seems dry and withered. Everyone looks like they're holding their heads and just sighing deeply. It seems there's no room to even calculate profit and loss; they've likely already put away the abacus. Distribution or bonuses are out of the question, and the common opinion is that they won't even be able to have a single cup of *toso* wine on New Year's morning.

"Ah-deun! What on earth is this thing that makes society so withered? Ah-deun, you heartless and extremely vicious thing! Why do you make it so hard for people to live?"
This is the phenomenon of the cries screamed by every person regarding the end of the Imsul year. Whether they are merchants, farmers, industrialists, or day laborers—

Yes! That being said, let's take a look around, east, west, south, and north, to see what the internal and external conditions are like.
How is Chongno Avenue?
It's very desolate. Whether it's due to lack of money or the cold weather, there are remarkably few people coming and going. Even the rickshaws and automobiles that used to be so common are not seen, and trams come and go only occasionally, one by one. A firewood seller, with a bundle of kindling on his arm, stands stock-still, shivering, while shop after shop has its doors tightly shut, the owners sitting idly with grim faces, chain-smoking.
Standing in front of the Tong'a Puin Sanghoe (East Asia Women's Company) for ten minutes to observe customer traffic, I discovered only—five entering and four leaving.<56>
Spending another ten minutes to observe pedestrians heading east and west, I found—153 heading east and 179 heading west (counting men, women, old, young, even carts and horses).
Looking at this, one can clearly grasp the life-or-death atmosphere of the year-end. If this, the main thoroughfare of Kyŏngsŏng city, is like this, other alleys are not worth mentioning. Well, let's leave this place.
How is Chongno 4-ga Intersection?
It's also the same. Again, spending ten minutes, I stood firm in front of the Kim Yun Cotton Cloth Store (金潤冕布木廛). Pedestrians numbered 189 heading north and 162 heading south. Customers entering and leaving shops were five entering and two leaving. This is the current situation at Chongno 4-ga Intersection at year-end. Perhaps because prices are high or money is scarce, most people go in empty-handed and come out empty-handed. Even if there was some bargaining, it was mostly for children's clothing fabric, or usually just carrying a few feet of Western wood. The situation of the shop owner, sitting frowning like a starving mother-in-law, looks very pitiful. Well then—
How is Honmachi Avenue (Ponjŏng-t'ong, 本町通)?
It looks much more lively than Chongno Avenue. Those fellows (Japanese) seem undeniably possessed of a year-end mood. The view starkly contrasts the so-called Japanese style and Korean style for Korean women. Shop after shop has its doors wide open, displaying myriad goods. With signs proclaiming "Year-End Grand Sale" or "Grand Sale with Prizes," strung up with red and white paper slips, the sight of them calling out "Come in!" "Buy!" truly looks like the year-end. Among them, the most clamorous thing is the sound of their *geta* clogs, and the primary concern is protecting one's own insteps. Wondering how many pedestrians there were here, I took position on the Nii-hyŏn (泥峴, Jin'gogae) slope and pulled out my watch. It's comparable to Chongno. 182 heading east and 175 heading south. Calculated proportionally, it's much more prosperous than Chongno. And this place would be most crowded around 8 or 9 PM. Seeing it like this around 5 PM, one could count probably 300-400 people in ten minutes around 8 or 9 PM. But at that time, Chongno would likely have less than half the daytime number (During summer, Chongno also has many nighttime pedestrians).
So, how is the business in the shops? Even at a glance, every store is full. Observing from outside the Daikoku (大黑) store, the result was—five entering and six leaving. The shop below it was the same.
Now, what about the ratio of Koreans and Japanese? Observing roughly, it seems to be about half and half. Although Japanese are slightly more numerous, Koreans are also constantly present, whether as pedestrians or shop visitors.<57>
It looks more crowded than Chongno. Looking into the underlying reason, it seems they gather here out of necessity. That is, Korean goods are transferred from Japanese merchants, so the quality is inferior and they are not well-stocked. And the prices are high. Therefore, they have no choice but to go to Jin'gogae.
Seeing this, the feeling "They're dead—ah, the Korean people are dead!" arises intensely. At the same time, I firmly gave up on the task entrusted by a student to buy a pair of Western socks. And I wanted to leave Jin'gogae quickly. However, I couldn't help but check the bustling state of that Mitsukoshi (三越).
Ah—the astounding bustle of Mitsukoshi! In ten minutes, 36 people entered and 24 exited. Entering to look inside, it was like a swarm of ants on a cloudy day, packed tightly on the upper, middle, and lower floors, unable to move past each other. The thought that I was just pointlessly getting my clothes rubbed and worn out flared up like fire, and I immediately made a run for it. (Above observed from 3 PM to 5 PM on the 20th)

二, 東西人의內氣分 (Inner Feelings of Easterners and Westerners)
"Hey, how much bonus did you get? Let's have a drink."
"Bonus? What bonus? I'm like a dog chasing a chicken [got nothing]."
"Still, you must have gotten at least something? Can't be absolutely nothing?"
"Don't talk about it. Forget the bonus, I haven't even gotten this month's salary."
"Ah—is your company that broke?......... Hey, you're lying, right? Come on, treat me."
"No, seriously, stop 'dancing like it's moving day' [acting restless/falsely busy], you treat me. I heard your company gave out a 30% bonus."
"Who told you that? 30%? Why not 300%?"
"I heard all about it. You think you can fool a ghost? Trying to fool me..."
"No, really, they gave an extra month's salary—even that caused a lot of arguments."
"One month or two, let's have a drink. Now that we've met."
"Don't have it, don't have it. Already bid it farewell. Right on that day."
"Man, don't be like that. Let's go."
This seems to be the banter between an employee of some newspaper company and a magazine company. One, shoulders slumped, with a look of having eaten nothing, hopes for another's leftovers, while the other, having received at least a little, smirks with a somewhat puffed-up air. (In some editorial office)

Whether he's the Chief (署長) or some Section Head (主任), I don't know, but a red-striped figure [likely police officer] orders an assembly. The policemen gather around as if something major has happened, eyes wide. Well over a hundred of them. "Ichi!" "Ni!" they call out numbers. Seems some instruction <58> is coming down from the Chief. I don't know what's being said, but it seems he's talking about the work performance over the past year. The policemen, perhaps sensing something, suddenly show pleased expressions. After talking for quite a while, he hands out envelopes one by one in order. They were indeed money pouches. Everyone's mouths fall open, wondering "How much could it be?" and with the most itching curiosity, they tear open the envelopes.
Some look unexpectedly happy, while others, perhaps disappointed compared to their expectations, hang their heads low. And there are those who peek and pry, insistently trying to see others' envelopes. They were told to disperse. This time, they start asking each other. A commotion ensues.
"Hey, Officer Pak (朴巡査), how much did you get?" "Uh, don't ask." "Ah, come on, how much? Let me see." "I said I won't show you, why are you doing this?" There are those persistently asking to see, and those running away trying not to show. The most amusing sights are the posture of those who got a lot, and the way those who got little hide the envelope in their Western suit pockets. And those who stick out their tongues (舌) and look away.
But is this also the official style? It seems they go to report to their superior. Is it boasting about performance, or a return courtesy saying 'thank you for giving it'? They customarily bring the envelope before the superior and bow. Then the superior asks each one, "Kimi wa ikura?" (How much for you?). Some reply readily, "Hai, kujūgo en desu" (Yes, 95 yen), "Watakushi wa..." (As for me...), while others, seemingly embarrassed, can't finish their answer and quickly flee. By the way, one fellow with facial scars got 190 yen and grins at everyone he meets. He probably caught quite a few people. Other government offices are likely the same. (Overheard while visiting a certain police station)

"Mr. Kim (金先生), the exams are all over, and tomorrow is the break-up ceremony, so in this mood of relief mixed with regret, how about we all have a drink tomorrow evening?"
"Well, I was thinking the same thing... Mr. Ch'oe (崔先生), what do you think?"
"I agree too."
"Mr. Yi (李先生), what about you?"
"Well, I already had a bottle last night."
"Already, by yourself?"
"No, with ○○... But listen, folks, I felt embarrassed going to the restaurant (料理집). The financial world is in such a panic that the restaurant was utterly empty."
"It probably looks like that. What's the point of talking about the economy? But we should have a year-end party (忘年會), right?"<59>
"Well then, let's get everyone's agreement and have a night out."
"How much should the fee be, and where should the venue be?"
"Let's make the fee about three won each, and the place Myŏngwŏlgwan (明月館)."
"Isn't three won too much?"
"Too much? I wonder if even that won't be enough."
"Alright then, let's just do it tomorrow evening."
"Tomorrow? Isn't tomorrow too soon?"
"Why? Let's just do it. It's uncomfortable waiting, expecting to eat."
This is a conversation overheard in a certain school office. The agreement to have a drink is mutual, and the fact that restaurants are empty is also true. It seems everywhere is like this at the end of the Imsul year.

"How were your results this time? Top or number one, right? You studied that much."
"Number one? Don't talk about it. Seems I failed. The results aren't out yet, so I don't know for sure, but I think I probably failed."
"But you did so well on the exam..."
"No, seriously. I completely messed up. Messed up algebra, messed up English, it's unbelievable. Ah, I hate that algebra teacher so much I can't go to school. He gives ridiculously difficult problems, and then stands right in front of me. Can't cheat, can't look at the book. Ah, I'm ruined."
"No, did you bring the book?"
"No, it was the one ○○ brought..."
"Why did you mess up English?"
"Because I don't know English in the first place... By the way, how were your results? You did well, of course?"
"Me? Of course, I did well. Plus or minus, I'm always number one anyway."
"No, tell me straight, what rank?"
"What's the use of knowing? Come on, let's talk about something else... Are you going back to your hometown?"
"Probably can't. Money has to arrive... Big trouble. Got a letter from home a few days ago, saying forget the travel expenses for coming down and back, they can't even afford tuition anymore. Said they'd somehow send just ten won and told me to pack up and come home for good. Gosh, I'm speechless. Said one mal of rice costs one won eighty jeon."
"That's really serious trouble. I'm in the same boat as you. Asked them to send just twenty won, but only ten won came. Half price, really, half price. I'm speechless..."<60>
"Well, at least it came, so that's something. Come on, forget about that stuff. I'm angry too, let's go see a show."
"Where?"
"Either Tansŏngsa (團成社) or Chosŏn Kŭkchang (朝鮮劇場)."
"Do you have money?"
"Aren't you supposed to pay? Hey, treat me once."
"Speaking of shows, I went last night. To Tansŏngsa... That place was unbelievable too. Totally empty. Whenever I've seen it before, the theater was full, but why is it like that these days? Maybe 200-300 people in total, upper and lower levels combined?"
"Why wouldn't it be?... Anyway, let's go check it out. Towards Chosŏn Kŭkchang."
"Let's go, but don't whine (그렁이대지말게) on the way back."
"We'll see about that. How can we just come back empty-mouthed after seeing a show? It's cold too."
This is a conversation overheard in a student dormitory in Waryongdong (臥龍洞). It's the year-end and vacation time, so one might expect the student community's mood to be lively, but at the end of the Imsul year, the student world also seems utterly deflated.

"Has everyone gone out in this house? Why is it so quiet?"
"Ah, Auntie, you've come? Please come in."
"Are you well?"
"Yes, our family is fine. How about your family, Auntie? Are the little ones growing well? Oh my, the weather is very cold."
"Cold as it is, yesterday and today are extremely bitter, aren't they? Perhaps because the winter solstice is tomorrow."
"Auntie, you came from the bathhouse, I see."
"I wanted to take a bath after a long time, but there were so many people, I barely managed to scrub myself and lingered a bit before coming out. I've never been in such a rush."
"Because the Japanese New Year is approaching, and schools are breaking up, all those students probably take a bath at least once, right? Since they're going back to the countryside too."
"The bathhouse is fundamentally small, so it's always like that."
"Oh my, Auntie, did you buy a new gourd dipper (조박이)? How much did you pay?"
"I don't even know the price. I just picked it up saying I'd pay when I get money."
"Ah, indeed, Auntie, your household will be getting a bonus, won't you?"
"Probably get at least something substantial. Last year, quite a lot came in, but this year seems lackluster, from what I hear <61> outside."
"But they say banks never lack money?"
"Can't always be without. There must be at least some."
"Look at that, others get salaries and bonuses like that, but in our house... Look here. Starting tomorrow, we might have to starve. The rice shop keeps demanding payment, several times a day, but is there a single penny? Is there anything to pawn? It's truly pitiful. And yet, the master of the house outside puffs out his chest and only drinks."
"Oh, I must be going. The children will be waiting."
"Ah, why are you leaving as soon as you arrive? You came after such a long time, stay and chat a bit longer."
"No, I really must go."
This is a conversation from the inner room (안방) of a house in Sŭngdong (寺洞). As the hostess brings up her household worries, the guest, sensing that a needy request might follow if she stays longer, quickly catches on, makes an excuse about her children, and immediately gets up to leave. The shrewdness of the banker's wife is startling, but the desperate situation of the hostess, whose plea is instantly rejected almost before it's fully voiced, who suppresses whatever request was half-formed, her face flushing—this is truly pitiful to see. I don't know for sure, but she will probably cry out "Ah-deun!" and weep all night.

"Ah—is that ○○? Come in."
"Ah—many people have gathered. Is there a meeting?"
"Meeting? No, just gathered naturally, adding up to four or five people."
"I thought I might run into you guys if I came here. Gosh, I have nowhere to go, it's terrible. Always gathering at this house."
Perhaps having nothing to say, they are silent for a while. They seem to be searching for a topic, wondering what would be good to talk about. After a moment, words like these emerge from someone's mouth:
"Come on—what's the point of sitting stock-still like this, like borrowed barley sacks? At the very least, let's tell old stories, or if not, that book we looked at last night..." At the words "that book we looked at last night," everyone snickers, "Yeah—that's good," and shifts their bottoms. But one person, not understanding the meaning, asks, "That book? What book?" "Man, you idiot, you should know by now," they laugh. Then, the person sitting by the desk pulls out Hwatu cards from a lacquer box (舌盒) and says, "Alright—let's play. It's the year-end, the night is long, and we're bored... And we need to make use of the time too." At this, the one who asked earlier, as if struck by enlightenment, says, "Ah—you mean that? Crazy <62> kids, I really thought you meant a book," and laughs heartily.
Now, the question is whether to play for cigarettes or for alcohol. In the end, playing for cigarettes wins. Each empties their pockets and calls out "Roma" [a brand of cigarettes]. (In some rented house (舍廓) in Kwŏnnongdong (勸農洞))

"For the New Year's feast (歲饌), is alcohol best? Pheasant? Chicken? Fruit isn't bad either, what would be good? I need to send some New Year's food to ○○'s house (Kim something)..."
"Man, what nonsense are you talking? If you have money to send there, let's use it among ourselves. What good do you think comes from sucking up to those kinds of people? Their unpleasantness (아니) just inflates their arrogance."
This was heard from a pedestrian on the main street of Kyodong (校洞).

"Hey, how many New Year's cards (年賀狀) are you ordering? I'm about to order from the newspaper office (新聞館), so tell me."
"I'll pass. I have no money, and besides, I have nowhere to send them."
"Still, at least a few... New Year's greetings are once a year, so we should exchange regards."
"What nonsense are you talking? No. It's just what everyone else does."
"Let's do it precisely because everyone does it. You sometimes act strangely."
This was heard in a corner of ○○ company.

"Is Christmas (크리쓰마쓰) tomorrow or today? Seems like all the churches (各敎會堂) are quite busy. Saw it in the newspaper today."
"Of course, they must be busy. It's a major festival for the Christian Church (耶蘇敎會)."
"By the way, is this year 1923?"
"We have to wait a few more days. It's still the Imsul year (壬戌年)."
This is the conversation of some students from the countryside heading towards the train station.

"Damn alliances (同盟) and strikes (罷業)! How can we survive if it continues like this year? Looks like we won't even be able to buy a single string of dried pollack (北魚) for New Year's."
"Tell me about it. If we can't live, let's try not living to the extreme. Let's see what happens. There's still no door marked 'die'. Let's make up our minds firmly and endure for just one month. Let's see who wins."
This was heard from the crowd after some lecture meeting ended.

"Hey, Kimsun (金順), what clothes did you get made?"
"I didn't get any made. You?"
"Me neither."
"Is your family taking tomorrow off for the solar calendar [New Year]?"
"Yes. How about your family?"
"We are—not."
"Why?"
"I don't know."
This is the conversation of some young girls.
This is generally the mood at the end of the Imsul year. There might be stranger feelings hidden deeper inside, but I couldn't find out everything. This much was gathered by busily running around... (End) (Above from the 19th to the 22nd) <63>

**Summary**

The article "Eight Views of the Year-End in the Imsul Year (1922)" by Ch'unp'a depicts the bleak and economically depressed atmosphere in Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul) as 1922 draws to a close. Through vignettes observed in different locations – the desolate Korean commercial district of Chongno contrasting sharply with the bustling Japanese district of Ponjŏng (Honmachi), conversations revealing unpaid salaries and cancelled bonuses, worried discussions among teachers and students about finances and bleak futures, and domestic scenes highlighting poverty and social anxieties – the author paints a picture of widespread hardship affecting nearly all segments of Korean society. The mood is one of resignation, frustration, and a palpable sense of economic crisis overshadowing the usual year-end festivities.

From a historical perspective, the article is particularly revealing about the economic realities of colonial Korea in the early 1920s. The stark contrast between the struggling Korean businesses on Chongno and the thriving Japanese businesses on Honmachi (including the prominent Mitsukoshi department store) vividly illustrates the economic disparity and the dominance of Japanese capital. The conversations about unpaid wages, lack of bonuses, rising prices (rice), inability to afford school fees, and general financial distress provide direct evidence of the economic hardships faced by ordinary Koreans, including professionals, students, and laborers. Historians might find the detailed observations of daily life, social interactions, and expressed sentiments valuable for understanding the socio-economic impact of Japanese colonial rule and the specific atmosphere of discontent during this period, potentially linked to broader economic downturns or colonial policies.

鐘路通보다는 훨신 活氣가 잇서 보인다 놈들이야 말로 어쩔수 업시 年末的氣分을 確實이 가지고 잇다 朝鮮婦女의 이른바 왜설 조선설의 觀이  갈리운다 店店이 店門을 通開하고 萬貨를 陳列하얏다 歲暮大賣出이니 景品附大賣出이니하야 赤白色의 지를 좍 거러노코『들어오시요』『사시요』하는 光景은 實로 歲暮가타 보인다 그 中에도 第一撓亂한 것은 그들의 게다는 소리이며 第一注意할 것은 各自의 발둥 保護件이다 이놈의 대는 行人이 얼마나 되는가 하고 泥峴마루턱을 占하고 時計를 내들엇다 鐘路와 比等하다 東行이 百八十二人이요 南行이 百七十五人이다 比例로 저보면 鐘路보다 훨신 殷盛한 것이다 그리고 이곳이란 夜八九時頃이 第一複雜하겟다 五時頃이 如此하고보니 八九時頃이면 無慮十分間三四百名을 計할 수 잇겟다 그러나 그의 鐘路는 無慮晝間의 半數도 못되는 것이다 (夏期는 鐘路도 夜間行人이 多함)
그러면 商店의 흥정은 어한가 얼핏보아도 店마다 滿員이다 大黑이란 店門밧게서 檢察한 結果―이 入五人出이 六人이다 고알엣 商店도 그러하고.
그런데 朝鮮人日本人의 數爻는 어한가 大綱檢察하고보니 上半이나 되어 보인다 日人이 좀 만키는 하나 朝鮮人도 聯絡不絶이다 行人이든지 店의 出入이든지＜57＞
鐘路보다 만아보인다 그-裏面을 알고보니 不得己하야 이리로 모이는 貌樣이다 卽朝鮮人商品이란 日人에게서 移來한 것이니 品도 劣하고  具備치 못하겟다 그리고 價는 高하겟다 그러니 不得己 진고개로을밧게.
이러하고보니 『죽엇구나 아-朝鮮人은 죽엇구나』의 感이 激切히 생긴다 同時에 어떤 學生의 付托이든 洋襪一足買得의 件을 斷然히 絶하얏다 그리고 진고개를 時急히 나고 십헛다 그러나 彼-三越의 景氣는 한번 參考치 아니할 수 업다
아-可驚의 三越景氣! 十分間入人이 三十六人이요 出人이 二十四人이다 內部를 入觀하니 흐린 날개 암(蟻)이 떼가티 上中下三層에 꽉 엉키어 往來를 서로 못하고 잇다 空然한 求景에 衣服만 비벼러친다는 생각이 불가티 일어나서 곳走字를 대고 말앗다(以上二十日午后三時로 五時지)
二, 東西人의內氣分
『자네 賞與金얼마나 탓나? 한잔먹세그려』
『賞與金이다- 무언가 닭조차가든 개모양일세』
『그래도 다만 얼마라도 탓겟지 노상업슬나고?』
『말말게 賞與는 둘재고 이달 月給도 못탓네』
『아- 자네 社가 그러케도 비엿나…………이사람 거짓말이지 어서 한턱하게』
『아닌게 아니라『동세춤추듯』하지말고 자네가 한턱하게 자네 社에서는 三十割式이나 주엇다고』
『누가 그러든가 三十割? 왜 三百割이 어떤고』
『내가 다- 들엇네 이 사람 鬼神을 속이게 나를…』
『아닌게 아니라 한달 月給은 더-주데 그것도 議論이 만하가지고』
『한달이고 두달이고 한잔먹세 자-말낫슬에』
『업네업서 벌서 다-사욧나라 시켯네 그날 卽時로』
『이 사람 그러지말고 어서가세』
이것은 어떤 新聞社員과 雜誌社員의 酬酌이겟다 한 者는 억개지가 푹 늘어저가지고 못먹은 氣色으로 남의 餘瀝을 바라고 한 者는 그나마 족음 먹엇다하야 좀 한 氣色으를 빙글거린다 (어떤 編輯室에서)

署長인지 무슨 主任인지는 모르나 건줄박이가 聚立命分을 내리운다 巡査들은 무슨 큰일이나 난 듯이 눈이 휘둥글해서 죽-모여선다 百名은 훨신 넘겟다『イチ』『ニ』하고 番號를 부른다 署長으로부터 무슨 訓令＜58＞이 내리는가 보다 무슨말인지는 모르나 一年동안 働務의 成績을 말하나보다 巡査들은 무슨 氣味나 알아차렷는지 갑자기 조하하는 氣分을 운다 한참동안이나 말을 하더니 封套한 個式을 次例로 논하준다 그야말로 돈주머니엿다 모다 입이 벌여지며『얼마식이나 되나』하고 가장 간지러운 마음으로 封套를 어본다
意外인듯이 或-깃버하는 者도 잇고 바라든 바와 틀니는지 고개를 푹 숙이는 者도 잇다 그리고 서로 넘석넘석하며 남의 封套를 구태여 엿보는 者도 잇다 혜쳐 去를 말하얏다 이번은 제 各其뭇기를 始作한다 한참 야단이다
『여보게 朴巡査 자네는 얼마인가』『응 말말게』『아- 글세 얼마야 좀 보세』『안보인다는데 왜이래』하며 자 보자고 조르는 者도 잇고 아니 보이려고 다라나는 者도 잇는데 第一可觀은 만히 탄 者의 억개즛이며 못탄 者의 洋服 주머니에 封套감추는 이다 그리고 헤-하고 헤(舌)를 물고 外面하는 者이다
그런데 이것도 官廳式인지? 上官을 차자 報告를 하는가보다 成績자랑인지 아니『주셔서 고맙다는』回禮인지 上官압헤 依例히 封套를 들고와서 禮를 한다 그러면 上官은『キミハ イクラ』하고 番番이 뭇는다 무르면『ハイ クジユコエンデス』『ワタクシハ………』等 快히 對答하는 者도 잇고 부러운듯이 對答을 채워못하고 얼풋 다라나는 者도 잇다 그런데 어떤 面傷者하나는 百九十圓이 나타가지고 對하는 사람마다 빙글빙글한다 아마 사람개나 톡톡히 잡은가보다 다른 官廳도 아마 이 모양이겟지 (어떤 警察署를 들럿다가)

『金先生 試驗도다- 나고 來日이면 放學式도 되니 시원섭섭한판에 來日저녁은 한잔식 먹지』
『글세 나도 그런 생각이 잇는데………崔先生은 어소』
『나도 同感이요』
『李先生은 어소』
『글세 나는 엇저녁 한통 불녓는걸』
『벌서 혼자셔?』
『아니 ○○하고 그런데 여보소들 料理집 가기가 부러워 못가겟습듸다 財界가 어나 恐慌한지 料理店이 휭덩그런히 비엿습듸다그려』
『아마 그런 모양입듸다 財界말이야 말해무엇하겟소 그러나 忘年會야 한번하야지』＜59＞
『글세 그러면 여러 先生의 同議를 어더가지고 하루 저녁 놀아보지』
『會費는 얼마하고 場所는 어대로할가』
『會費는 限三圓式하고 場所는 明月館으로 하지』
『會費三圓이 過하지안흘가』
『過하긴 그것도 不足되지안나보오』
『자-그러면 來日저녁으로 實行해버리지』
『來日? 來日이 急하지안흘가』
『무엇 아조해버려요 먹겟거니하고 기다리기 거북해』
이것은 어떤 學校事務室에서 겻귀로 들은 이약이다 한잔 먹자는 것도 同感이고 料理店이 휑 비엿다는 것도 事實이다 壬戌年末은 到處가 그 모양인가보다

『자네는 이번 成績이 어한가 優等아니면 一號지 工夫를 그만콤이나 햇스니』
『一號? 말말게 落第己세 아즉 成績發表를 아니햇스니 몰으긴하지만 아마 落第인가보아』
『아조- 試驗을 잘츠려스니………』
『아니야 정말이야 아조잡앗는걸 代數잡고 英語잡고 말아닐세 아-고런 내원 代數先生미워서 學校에 못가겟데 問題는 至毒히 어렵게 내여노코  내 압헤 와서 버티고 섯겟지 방망이니 할 수 잇나 冊을 볼 수 잇나 아이 내 혼낫네』
『아니 冊은 가지고 갓든가』
『아니야 ○○이가 가지고 온 것을……』
『英語는 왜 잡앗나?』
『英語는 원체 모르니…… 그런데 자네는 成績이 어떤가 勿論잘츠럿겟지?』
『나말인가 勿論잘츠럿지 풀너쓰거나 마이너쓰거나 一號는 밤낫하니』
『아니 바루말해 몃番인가?』
『그건알면무엇하나 자-다른이약이나하세………자네 시골가겟나?』
『아마 못갈가보이 돈이와야지……큰알낫데 며칠젼집에서 片紙가 왓는데 내려왓다갈 車費는 말고 工夫부터 못시키겟다하얏데 어케든지 限十圓보닐게 아조 束裝歸來를 하라고 하얏데 내원 氣가 막혀서 쌀 한말에 一圓八十錢이라든가』
『참근일들나서 나亦是자네와 一樣일세 二十圓만 보내라하얏더니 겨우 十圓왓데 折半와 리야 折半 氣가 막히서……』＜60＞
『그나마왓스니 괜치안네 자-그지놈의거 火도나고하는데 求景이나가세』
『어대로』
『團成社나 朝鮮劇場이나 間에』
『자네돈잇나?』
『자네가 내일것아닌가 여보게 한번시켜주게』
『求景말이낫스니말이지 나는 엇저녁갓다왓네 團成社에……그곳도 말아니데그려 텡텡비엿는데어느보아도 劇場은 滿員이 드니 이즈음은 왜그모양인지 上下層統틀어 限二三百名될지?』
『왜 안그러켓나……엇잿든 가보세나그려 朝鮮劇場께로』
『가긴가세만은 올에 그렁이대지말게』
『그거야 지내보세나그려 求景갓다가 어케맨입으로돌아오겟나 날도춤고한데』
이것은 臥龍洞어떤 學生寄宿舍에서 들은 이약이가 年末이요 放學요하니 學生界의 氣分은 母論씩씩할듯하나 壬戌年末은 學生界도 푹 늘어진모양이다.

『이 宅에선 다- 어대가셧나 어째 從容해?』
『아-아즈머니오셔요 어서들어옵시요』
『平安하오』
『네 우리집은 別故업습니다 아즈머니댁은요 어린것들 잘자라오 아구 날이매우춥습니다』
『치운들 어제오늘은 極塞이로구려 冬至가 來日이니 그런지』
『아즈머니 沐浴하시구옵니다그려』
『오래간만에 沐浴이라고좀해보려니 어나 사람이만흔지 艱辛히비비대고 조곰슬적거리다가왓섯지 내 그러케밧분건』
『日本설이갓가와오니 그리고 各學校放學도 되고 그-만흔 學生들이 다-한번式은 하겟지요 싀골도 가려니』
『원체 沐浴湯이작으니 언제든지그모양인지』
『아이 아즈머니 조박이 새로사셧구려? 얼마주셧섯요』
『얼마인지갑도모르지 돈생기면준다고 그냥집어들고왓스니』
『아이참 아즈머니 宅에선 賞與金타시겟구려』
『아사리 大網얼마라도타겟지 昨年은 꽤만이생겻더니만 今年은 시언치안흔모양이야 밧게서 하는말＜61＞을들으니』
『그래도 銀行에서는 번지는가업다든데요』
『노상이야업슬나고 다만얼마라도잇겟지』
『저것봐 남은저러케 月給먹고 賞與먹고하는데우리집에선………글세이것보시오 來日부터는 밥을굼게되엇구려 쌀가가에서는 자쌀갑내라고 하루도 몃번 式조르는데 돈이한푼잇소 典當잡힐것이나잇소 참-해서 그래도 밧갓양반은 배ㅅ심펴고 술만잡숫는다오』
『아이 나는가겟소 아이들이기다릴터이니』
『아- 왜이러케오시자마자가신다해요 오래간만에 오셧다가 좀더- 놀다가셔요』
『아니 가야겟서』
이것은 寺洞어떤집안방에서하는이약이다 主人側에서 살림걱정을내노흐니 좀더-잇스면 苟且한 請이나을가하야 얼른알아채리고 아이핑게를하고곳일어서는 어떤 銀行家의 婦人手段도 깜즉하거니와 哀呼가 나오자마자 今時곳 拒絶을 當하고 반쯤을나왓든 무슨 要求를 그대로 라안치며 얼굴이 벌개지는 主人側의 絶望하는 情況이야말로 하도 해보인다 모르긴하지만 그는 『아-든아』소리를 치며 밤새도록 울 것이다

『아- ○○인가 들어오게』
『아-만히들모엿네 무슨會議가잇나?』
『會議는 모이노라모인 것이 충충모아 四五人되네』
『이리로오면 그대네들을맛날줄알앗네 나-참 갈대업서 큰일낫데 밤낫모여야이집이지』
할말이업는지 한참동안서로말이업다 서로무슨말을햇스면조흘가하고 말의 材料를 擇하는 모양이다 얼마잇더니 어떤 者의 입으로 이런말이나온다
『자-이것 어온버리ㅅ자루모양으로 이러케 우둑허니안젓슬것이야무엇잇나 하다못해 옛말을해도하고 그러치안흐면 엇저녁보든 그冊이라도……』하얏다『엇저녁보든 그冊이란』말에 一同은 픽우스며『야-그거좃타』하고 엉덩이를들먹거린다 그러나 어떤 者는 意味를 모르는지『그 冊이라니 무슨冊?』뭇는다『이사람 이바보 그만하면알겟지』하고웃는다 그리자 冊床머리에 안젓든 者는 舌盒으로서 花鬪張을 집어내며『자-하세 歲末도 되고 밤은 깁고 심심은 한데………그리고 時間利用도 해야지』한다 그리자 아 뭇든 者는 恍然大覺인듯이『아- 그것말인가 미친＜62＞자식들 나는 冊이라기에 正말속엇구만』하고 껄껄 웃는다.
이번은『담배내기를할가』『술내기를할가』가 問題이다 結局담배내기가 勝하얏다 各其주머니를 며『로마』를 부른다 (勸農洞어떤 舍廓에서)
『歲饌은 술이조흔가 꿩이조흔가 닭이조흔가 果物도 해롭지안흔데 무에조켓나 나는 ○○집에 (金무어)歲饌을 좀보내야겟는데』
『이사람 別소리다-하네 거긔사보낼돈잇스면 우리리먹세 그짓놈들에게 알량거리면무슨 數가생기는줄아나 그놈들의아니은 驕心만더-구쳐노치』
이것은 校洞巨里에서어떤 行人에게들은말이며
『여보게 자네는 年賀狀몃 枚나 注文하겟나 지금 新文館에 注文할터이니 말하게』
『나는 그만두겟네 돈도업고  는 보낼데도업네』
『그래도 다만몃枚라도……年賀란 一年한번이니 서로 安否삼아해야되네』
『別소리다-하네 안해 그짓 普通이다-하는즛』
『普通이다-하기에하자지 이사람은 잇다금 別하게놀데』
이것은 ○○社한모퉁이에서 들은말이며
『크리쓰마쓰-가 來日인가 오늘인가? 各敎會堂이 꽤 奔走한 모양이야 오늘 新聞을 보니』
『勿論奔走한터이지 耶蘇敎會에는 一大名節이니』
『그런데 今年이 一九二三年이지』
『며츨더지내야지 아즉도壬戌年이니』
이것은 停車場을向하는 엇던시골學生들의이약이며
『네어미 同盟이고 罷業이고 今年가태셔야살겟나 설날北魚한코도못사먹을가보이』
『글세말일세 못사는바엔 極端으로못살아보세 어케되나 그래도죽으란門은업네 꽉決心하고 한달만참아보세 누가이기나』
이것은어떤講演會가난뒤 群衆側에서 하는말이며
『이애金順아 너는무슨옷해두엇늬!』
『나는 안햇단다 너는?』
『나도안햇서』
『너의집에선 陽歷明日쉬늬?』
『그럼 너의집에선?』
『우리는 아-니』
『왜?』
『몰라』
이것은 어떤 少女들의 이약이다.
壬戌年末은 大槪氣分이 이러하다. 內面에는더-奇怪한氣分이만켓지만 다- 알아볼수업다 이나마 奔走히 돌아단넉기에………()(以上지난十九日로 同二十二日지)＜63＞
