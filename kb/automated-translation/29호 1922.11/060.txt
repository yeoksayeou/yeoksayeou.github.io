農村을 扶持하야 써 朝鮮을 扶持하라
						金永甲

1. 農村에 對한 覺悟 (Awareness Regarding Rural Villages)

Today in our society, learned gentlemen intensely debate various issues, calling them this problem or that problem. However, what I consider the most important issue needing prior resolution, alongside the education problem, is the rural village problem. Why is this? Because not only does the foundation of economic power in our Chosŏn <25> mostly derive from agricultural products produced by farming in rural villages, but also because our brethren related to rural villages occupy about 80 percent of Chosŏn's entire population. Therefore, neglecting the society of the teeming rural villages leaves no room to discuss the problem of Chosŏn's future. However, looking at the reality of this society, while there seems to be much study and implementation of measures regarding politics, law, religion, morality, art, and various other aspects, those who discuss rural villages and implement measures for them are extremely few, which is truly lamentable for our Hibiscus Domain (槿域 - Korea). What is even more worrying is that the foreigners currently residing within Chosŏn already number 400,000, their organizational structures are consolidating daily, and the scope of their influence expands by the hour. Alas! Sitting within the sorrowful tent besieged by enemies on all sides (四面楚歌), how can we possibly feel secure with a life of vague notions? Brethren! If you truly worry about the revival of the Chosŏn people, first direct your will to the problem of the rural villages, proceed to focus the world's public opinion on this, apply emergency measures even a moment sooner to the rural villages bordering on decline to avert peril, and strive for complete recovery. Solidifying the stability of our lives is the greatest, most urgent task at hand.

2. 小作料의 輕減이 急務 (The Urgent Need to Reduce Tenancy Fees)

More than half of the total cultivated land area in our Chosŏn is under tenancy. To show this with numbers: within the paddy field area of 1,543,000 *chŏngbo* (町步), owner-farmed paddies are 548,000 *chŏngbo*, and tenant-farmed paddies are 995,000 *chŏngbo*. Within the dry field area of 2,782,000 *chŏngbo*, owner-farmed fields are 1,644,000 *chŏngbo*, and tenant-farmed fields are 1,178,000 *chŏngbo*. To further show the proportion relative to the total area: for paddy fields, owner-farmed is 35.5% and tenant-farmed is 64.5%; for dry fields, owner-farmed is 57.6% and tenant-farmed is 42.4%. Thus, it is knowable that our farmers barely sustain their lives through tenancy.
Furthermore, recently, they suffer severe blows to their livelihoods by having about 50 to 60 percent of the produce obtained through tenancy cruelly plundered (掠奪) by tyrannical landowners, causing their suffering to intensify greatly. Therefore, those pitiful tenant farmers lament the viciousness of the landlords, cry out that farming yields no profit, that one cannot make a living through farming, that farming is the lowest among occupations. Some compatriots, unable to bear the hardship <26> of difficult living, emigrate overseas. Others, enduring until they can endure no more, run to the bustling cities (紅廛萬丈) seeking to sustain their lives (連命) through labor by entering factories or other workplaces. Thus, the fact that the number of people abandoning rural villages increases year by year is a major problem concerning the future survival of the Chosŏn nation, which we cannot pass over in silence (黙過). To first alleviate the livelihood difficulties of these tenant farmers and somewhat treat the decline of the rural villages, it lies in aiming for the reduction of tenancy fees (小作料). To realize this, we must urge deep reflection (猛省) through public opinion to sweep away the egoism of the large landowner class (大地主輩), who are positioned in the so-called capitalist class and dare to carry out unreasonable exploitation, taking advantage of the current low level of farmers' knowledge and economic standing, so that landlords only receive an amount corresponding solely to the land rent. At the same time, we must urge the farmers' self-awakening (自覺), so that through unity, they earnestly demand from the landlords and strive for the reduction of tenancy fees (it is deemed appropriate for it to be 35% of the total income). In this way, let us somewhat avert the peril of the rural villages, which are gradually heading towards desolation and destruction.

3. 自作農의 創設 (Establishment of Owner-Farmers)

Reducing tenancy fees is merely averting temporary peril; we cannot be satisfied with this. We must devise more complete relief measures to ensure the security of life, namely, the establishment of owner-farmers (自作農創設). Tenant farmers cannot obtain the maximum profit from agriculture, and thus cannot achieve the complete reality of self-sufficiency; consequently, it is difficult to expect the development of agriculture and rural villages. That is, because it is not their own land but the landlord's land, not only is there no affection (愛着心) for it, but they also cannot feel secure, unable to predict when their tenancy rights might be revoked. Therefore, concepts like fertilization, tending, and management (施肥手入營理) naturally become weak, and as an inevitable result, they cannot obtain the maximum harvest yield. Also, as tenants, their income is small, they cannot lead an affluent life, and must inevitably continue a perpetually poor and desolate existence. By elevating these pitiful tenant farmers to owner-farmers, instilling affection for the land and a sense of security, ensuring thoroughness in fertilization and general management to obtain the maximum yield, developing agriculture, and promoting the economy, we shall completely rescue the rural villages. However, regarding the establishment of owner-farmers, observing broadly, how can we maintain the current owner-farmers who are decreasing annually due to reasons such as selling land to large landowners to engage in commerce or other speculative enterprises following the changing times, or having their land foreclosed upon or subjected to compulsory execution due to mortgages or debts? Also, how can we elevate the tenant farmers, who occupy the majority of the cultivated area and are in a miserable state, to the class of owner-farmers? It is most appropriate to devise and implement two strategies for this. My humble preliminary plan (鄙案) regarding this is recorded as follows: <27>

4. 現在의 自作農의 維持方法 (Methods for Maintaining Current Owner-Farmers)

1. The fact that current owner-farmers sell their land or mortgage it to raise capital and move into commerce or other enterprises often stems from the result that even being an owner-farmer does not yield much profit. Therefore, encourage intensive farming (集約農) to increase production efficiency, thereby increasing profits and fostering attachment (執着心) to agriculture.
2. Have them save (貯蓄) the profits gained from intensive farming, use this money to engage in commerce and other enterprises, and avoid selling or mortgaging land to invest (投手) in enterprises unless they have adequate knowledge and experience in commerce or other businesses.
3. Greatly reduce taxes (租稅) on land to lessen the burden on owner-farmers. Currently in Chosŏn, the land tax per *tan* (反) of paddy field is 64 *chŏn*, the surtax (附加稅) is 58 *chŏn*, totaling 96 *chŏn*. For dry fields, the land tax is 16 *chŏn*, the surtax is 13 *chŏn*, totaling 29 *chŏn*. In mainland Japan, the paddy field land tax is 155 *chŏn*, the surtax is 2 *yŏn* 30 *chŏn* (230 *chŏn*), totaling 3 *yŏn* 85 *chŏn* (385 *chŏn*). For dry fields, the land tax is 39 *chŏn*, the surtax is 57 *chŏn*, totaling 96 *chŏn*. The authorities (當局者), comparing these numbers, claim that Chosŏn's taxes are light, less than 20% of Japan's. However, the reality is not so. That is, Chosŏn's agricultural production volume, compared to that of Japan's agricultural production, is merely 50% to less than 10% [per unit area, implied], and the economic level is rudimentary. Thus, the assertion of bearing a light tax burden of less than 20% is merely an absurd theory (荒唐設) uttered without looking into the substance of the matter. Examining this substance, it is not an overstatement to say that the taxes on land in Chosŏn are rather excessive (過額) compared to mainland Japan. Increase the business tax, which is far lighter compared to the agricultural land tax, and strive to reduce the burden on owner-farmers.
4. Establish financial institutions (金融機關) for owner-farmers to provide financial convenience (便益). (Currently, there are Local Financial Cooperatives (地方金融組合) as financial institutions, but the benefit they provide belongs to an extremely small portion.)
5. Conduct joint sales (共同販賣) of produce and joint purchasing (共同購入) of necessities to increase profits and achieve savings in consumption.
6. Implement other facilities for owner-farmers.

5. 小作農을 自作農으로 化하는 方法 (Methods for Transforming Tenant Farmers into Owner-Farmers)

1. Reduce taxes on land and have landlords reduce <28> tenancy fees for tenant farmers by that much.
2. Recognize permanent tenancy rights (永小作權) to sweep away the sense of insecurity among tenant farmers, have them engage in intensive farming, and make them strive diligently (勤勤孜孜) to increase production efficiency.
3. Establish financial institutions for tenant farmers, and further have the current Local Financial Cooperatives provide greater convenience to tenant farmers.
4. Landlords should provide financing to tenant farmers at extremely low interest rates and implement other facilities for tenant farmers.
5. Conduct joint sales of produce and joint purchasing of necessities to increase profits and achieve savings in consumption.
6. Encourage tenant farmers to practice saving diligently, and when the amount reaches about 200 *wŏn* or more, arrange mediation (斡旋) for land purchase (from large landowners) to aim for transformation into owner-farmers. However, the purchase area and ownership area per person should not exceed approximately six *tanbo* (反步) for paddy fields and one *chŏngbo* (町步) for dry fields. (This area calculation is mainly based on the current average area per farmer being five *tan* eight *myo* (五反八畝) for paddy fields and one *chŏngbo* for dry fields.)
7. If someone within a village (洞里) sells land, the village should borrow money through joint liability (連帶) or another appropriate method with annual installment repayment (年賦償還) to purchase the land as village property (洞有), and then transfer (拂下) it to tenant farmers through lottery or another suitable method with annual installment payments (年賦拂込).
8. When a tenant farmer wishes to purchase their current tenant land or land deemed suitable through an annual installment payment method, have the large landowner readily sell it off (拂下) to them.
9. Earnestly demand from the authorities that emigration (移民) for tenant farmers be discontinued (斷絶), and strive for its realization.
10. Implement other appropriate facilities for tenant farmers.

6. 自作農創設과 奮鬪 (Establishment of Owner-Farmers and Struggle)

Above, I have roughly outlined the methods regarding the establishment of owner-farmers, but considering the current level of the people's enlightenment (民度) and the obstinacy of the landlords, it cannot but be called a truly difficult task. Therefore, when embarking on its implementation, one must surely advance fiercely with firm will and courageous spirit. To achieve this, let us create general public opinion, establish agricultural cooperatives (農業組合), cooperate in unity with local youth groups (地方靑年團體) and intellectuals (知識偕級), and struggle (奮鬪) for implementation with keen activity, thereby completely rescuing the rural villages gradually heading towards devastation and ensuring the security of life for our farmers, our nation.
Thus, I present my humble views (鄙見) as above, urging the careful consideration of all learned gentlemen. <29>
<25-29>

**Summary**

This 1922 editorial by Kim Yŏnggap argues that reviving Korea (Chosŏn) requires prioritizing the revitalization of its rural villages, where 80% of the population lives and the economic base lies. He highlights the severe plight of tenant farmers, who constitute the majority cultivators, suffering under exploitative rents (50-60% of harvest) demanded by landlords, leading to poverty, abandonment of farming, and emigration. Kim proposes a two-pronged approach: immediate relief through reducing tenancy fees (to ~35%) via public pressure and farmer unity, and a long-term solution by establishing owner-farmers (自作農, *chajak nong*). He outlines specific measures for both maintaining existing owner-farmers (promoting intensive farming, savings, tax reduction, financial institutions, cooperatives) and transforming tenants into owner-farmers (permanent tenancy rights, low-interest loans, land purchase facilitation through village funds or installment plans, discouraging emigration). He acknowledges the difficulty but calls for a determined struggle involving public opinion, agricultural cooperatives, youth groups, and intellectuals.

From a colonial history perspective, the article is significant for its detailed portrayal of the dire economic conditions in rural Korea under Japanese rule, particularly the exploitative landlord-tenant system which impoverished the majority peasant class. It reflects early Korean nationalist thought linking economic self-sufficiency and rural stability to national survival and revival (扶持朝鮮 - Support Korea). The specific, practical reform proposals (tax adjustments, financial access, cooperative movements, land redistribution mechanisms like village purchase funds and installment plans) offer insight into contemporary Korean strategies for socio-economic improvement and resistance against colonial economic structures and collaborating landowners. The mention of Japanese tax comparisons and the presence of 400,000 "foreigners" (likely Japanese) underscore the colonial context.

1. 農村에 對한 覺悟

今日 우리 社會에 무슨 問題 무슨 問題하고 識者諸賢의 討究가 熾熱하나, 余의 思하는 바 가장 先決問題로의 重要한 者는 敎育問題와 相竝하야 農村問題라 하겟다. 何故오 하면 우리 朝鮮에서 經濟力의 基調가 되는 것은 그＜25＞大部分이 農村의 農業으로부터 産出되는 農産物에 在할 뿐 아니라 農村에 關係한 兄弟는 朝鮮 全人口의 約 8割을 占하는 바 그네의 芸芸하는 農村의 社會를 閑却하고 다시는 朝鮮明日의 問題를 論議할 餘地가 업는 故이다. 그러나 이 社會의 實際를 보면 政治, 法律, 宗敎, 道德, 藝術 其他 種種의 方面에 對하야는 講究도 하며 또는 이에 對한 施設을 行하는 者도 多한 듯 하나 農村을 論하며 그에 對한 施設을 行하는 者는 極少함은 實로 우리 槿域을 爲하야 寒心한 事라 하겟다. 더욱이 憂慮되는 바는 現在 朝鮮內地에 居住하는 外人이 이미 40萬人을 算하야 그네의 機關組織이 날로 充實하여 그네의 勢力範圍가 時로 擴張되는 그것이라. 嗚呼라. 四面楚歌의 憂愁帳裏에 坐하야 어떠케 漠然한 觀念의 生活로써 安然할 줄이 잇스리오. 兄弟여 당신들이 眞正으로 朝鮮族의 復興을 慮하거던 먼저 農村의 問題에 志를 致하며 나아가 天下의 輿論을 此에 集中케하야 一時라도 早速히 頹廢에 瀕한 農村에 應急手段을 施하야 危殆를 免하며 完全한 回復을 圖하야 吾人生活의 安定을 堅固히 함이 目下 最大 急先務라 한다.

2. 小作料의 輕減이 急務

우리 朝鮮의 總耕地面積의 過半이 小作이라. 此를 數字로 示하면 畓 面積 154萬3千 町步內 自作畓이 54萬8千 町步요. 小作畓이 99萬5千 町步며 田面積 278萬2千 町步內 自作이 164萬4千 町步요. 小作田이 117萬8千 町步니 此를 更히 全面的에 對한 比例를 示하건대 畓에 在하야는 自作이 3割5分5厘이요. 小作이 6割4分5厘이며 田에 在하야는 自作이 5割7分6厘이요, 小作이 4割2分4厘이니 우리 農民이 小作으로써 僅僅히 生을 維持함을 可知할지라.
더욱이 近來 橫暴한 地主되는 者에게 小作으로 獲得하는 生産物 中 約 5割乃至 6割을 慘酷히 掠奪을 當함으로 生活上 打擊을 受하야 苦悶이 滋甚하다. 그럼으로 彼 可憐한 小作農民은 地主의 惡毒함을 哀怨하며 農業은 利益이 업다하며 農業으로는 먹고 살 수 업다하며 農業은 職業中 第一 劣等하다 부르지즈며 或은 生活難의 乏迫을 견대지 못하야 海外로 移住하는 同胞도 有하며 견듸다＜26＞견듸지 못하야 工場이나 其他 勞働場에 入하야 勞働으로 連命코저 紅廛萬丈의 都會로 走하는 等 年年 農村을 棄하는 者 多함에 至함은 將來의 朝鮮民族存亡에 關하는 一大問題로서 吾人이 黙過할 수 업는 바이라. 爲先 此 小作農의 生活難을 緩解하야 農村의 衰頹를 多少라도 治療함에는 小作料의 輕減을 期함에 在하다 하노니 此의 實現을 圖함에는 所謂 資本階級에 處하야 잇는 大地主輩가 農民의 現在 知識 及 經濟程度의 低級함을 機會로 하야 無理의 搾取를 敢行하는 彼輩의 利己主義를 一掃하고 地主는 單只 地料에 相當한 額만 所得함이 되도록 輿論으로써 猛省을 促하는 同時에 更히 農民의 自覺을 促하되 團結하는 中에서 切實히 地主에게 要求하야 小作料 (全收入의 3割5分으로 宜當하다함)의 輕減을 圖할 것이라. 如此히하야 漸漸 荒廢破壞에 向하는 農村의 危殆를 多少라도 免케할지로다.

3. 自作農의 創設

小作料의 輕減은 一時의 危殆를 免함에 不過하니 此로써 滿足할 者 아니라. 더욱 完全한 救濟策을 講하야 生活의 安全을 期치 아니치 못할지니 即 自作農創設이 是라. 小作農으로는 農業의 最大利益을 得할 수 업스며 그리하야 自給自足의 完全한 實을 擧치 못할 것이며 딸하 農業과 農村의 發展을 期하기 難하다 할지니 即 自己의 所有土地가 아니요 地主所有의 土地라 是에 對한 愛着心이 無할 뿐더러 何時에 小作權의 取上을 當할지도 測치 못하야 安心치 못하는 故로 施肥手入營理 等의 觀念이 自然 薄弱히 되며 必然한 結果로 收穫量을 最大히 得치 못할 것이요. 또한 小作으로는 所得이 少하야 豊足한 生活을 營치 못하고 恒時 貧弱한 쓸쓸한 生活을 繼續치 아니치 못할지니 此 可憐한 小作農을 自作農으로 昇格하야 土地에 對한 愛着心과 安心을 含케하야 施肥 及 一般管理의 周到를 期하야 最大의 收益을 得케하며 農業을 發展케하야 經濟를 助長함으로 農村을 完全히 救濟할 것이라. 然而自作農創設에 當하야는 大體上으로 觀察을 下하야 現在의 自作農民이 時代의 變遷에 딸하 商業 又는 其他 投機的 企業을 營하기 爲하야 土地를 大地主에게 賣渡하며 土地를 抵當하얏다가 流質 或은 債權에 依하야 强制執行을 當하는 等의 原因으로 逐年減行하는 自作農을 如何히하야 維持케할 것인가. 또는 耕作面積의 大部分을 占한 悲慘의 狀態에 處한 小作農을 如何히 하야 自作農의 階級으로 引上할 것인가의 2個의 方策을 講究하야 此를 實行함이 至當할 것이라. 此에 對한 大略의 鄙案을 記하면 以下와 如하니＜27＞

4. 現在의 自作農의 維持方法

1. 現在의 自作農이 土地를 賣渡하며 此를 抵當하야 資本을 作하야 商業 又는 其他 企業으로 走함은 現在의 自作農이라 할지라도 利益이 多有치 못한 結果로부터 生함이 多한즉 集約農을 奬勵하야 生産能率을 增加케 함으로 利益을 多케하야 農業에 對한 執着心을 養成케할 事.
2. 集約農으로 得한 利益金은 貯蓄을 行케하야 此 金錢으로 商資 及 其他 企業을 營하게 하고 商業이나 其他 企業에 相當한 知識 及 經驗이 無한 限에 在하야 土地를 賣渡하며 又는 抵當하야 企業에 投手함을 避케할 事.
3. 土地에 對한 租稅를 大히 輕減하야 自作農民의 負擔을 少케할 것이니 現在의 朝鮮內地에 在하야 畓一反當에 對한 地稅가 64錢 附加稅가 58錢 計 96錢 田의 그것에 對한 地稅가 16錢 附加稅가 13錢 計 29錢이요 日本內地에 在하야는 畓의 地稅가 155錢 附加稅가 2, 30錢 計 三, 八五錢 田의 그것에 對한 地稅가 39錢 附加稅가 57錢 計 96錢이라. 當局者는 此의 數字를 對照하야 朝鮮은 日本에 比하야 2割 以下의 輕한 稅金이라 稱하나 그 實相은 不然하니 即 朝鮮의 農業生産量은 日本 農業生産量 그것에 對比하야 五割 乃至 十割 以上의 弱收에 不過하며 經濟程度가 幼稚한지라 2割 以下의 輕稅를 負擔한다 하는 說은 內容의 實質을 不窺하고 吐하는 荒唐設에 不過하다. 此의 實質을 檢察할 時는 오히려 日本內地보담 朝鮮內地의 土地에 對한 稅金이 過額이라 하야도 過言이 아니니 農業土地稅에 比하야 遙히 輕한 營業稅를 增加하고 自作農民의 負擔의 輕減을 圖할 事.
4. 自作農을 爲하는 金融機關을 設置하야 金融의 便益을 圖할 事 (現在 金融機關으로 地方金融組合이 有하나 便益을 與함은 極小 一部分에 屬한다.)
5. 生産物의 共同販賣와 必要品의 共同購入을 行하야 利益增進과 消費의 節約을 圖할 事.
6. 其他 自作農을 爲한 施設을 行할 事.

5. 小作農을 自作農으로 化하는 方法

2. 永小作權을 認定하야 小作農에게 不安의 念을 一掃하게하고 集約農에 就케하야 生産의 能率을 增加함에 勤勤孜孜케할 事.
3. 小作農을 爲하야 金融機關을 設置하며 다시 現在의 地方金融組合으로써 小作農에게 一層 便益을 與케할 事.
4. 地主는 小作人에게 極小低利로 金融을 圖하며 其他 小作人을 爲한 施設을 行케할 事.
5. 生産物의 共同販賣 及 必要品의 共同購入을 行하야 利益의 增進이며 消費의 節約을 圖할 事.
6. 小作農으로 하야곰 貯蓄을 勵行하게하야 그 金額이 約 200圓 以上에 達할 時에는 土地買收 (大地主의 土地)의 斡旋을 行하야 自作農化를 期하되 一人當 買收面積 及 所有面積은 畓에 在하야는 六反步田에 在하야는 一町步假量을 超치 안케할 事.
(此 面積의 算出은 現在 農業者 1人當 平均面積이 畓에 在하야 五反八畝요 田은 一町步임을 主로 한 것이라.)
7. 洞里內에서 土地를 賣渡하는 者 有하면 此를 洞里의 連帶 又는 其他 適當한 方法으로 年賦償還으로 金錢을 借入하야 洞有로 土地를 買收하야 此를 抽籤의 方法이나 其他 適當한 方法으로 小作農에게 年賦拂込으로 拂下할 事.
8. 小作人으로서 現在 自己 小作地 又는 適宜타 認하는 土地를 年賦拂込의 方法으로 願買할 時는 此를 大地主로 하야곰 快히 拂下케할 事.
9. 小作農을 爲하야 移民을 斷絶하도록 當局에 切熱히 要求하야 此의 實現을 期할 事.
10. 其他 適當한 小作農을 爲하는 施設을 行할 事.

6. 自作農創設과 奮鬪

以上에 自作農創設에 關한 方法을 大略 述하얏스나 此가 現在의 民度 及 頑固한 地主의 程度를 考察할 時는 實로 難關의 事라 아니할 수 업도다. 故로 此가 實行에 着手할 時는 必히 堅固한 意志와 勇敢한 意氣로써 猛進하여야 할 것이며 此를 期하기 爲하야 一般의 輿論을 作하며 農業組合을 設置하야 地方靑年團體며 知識偕級에 處한 人士와 一致協力하야 銳敏한 活動으로써 實行에 奮鬪함으로 漸漸 荒廢에 向하야가는 農村을 完全히 救濟하야 우리 農民 우리 民族 生活의 安全을 期하자 하노라.
以上과 如히 鄙見을 陳하야 諸賢의 一考를 促하노라.＜29＞
