**Summary**

This article, titled "Esperanto Self-Study Room" by Kim Ŏk, appeared in the November 1922 issue of the influential magazine *Kaebyŏk*. Lacking the body text, we can infer it was likely a guide or instructional piece aimed at enabling readers to learn Esperanto independently. Given Kim Ŏk's known advocacy for Esperanto and its promotion among Korean intellectuals during the colonial period, the article probably presented basic lessons or resources for self-learners. For historians, this piece is significant as it reflects the interest in international languages like Esperanto within colonial Korea, potentially as a means of fostering international connections and accessing information outside the Japanese-controlled sphere. Its publication in *Kaebyŏk*, a journal often associated with nationalist and critical viewpoints, further highlights the perceived cultural and perhaps subtly political importance of learning Esperanto during this era.
