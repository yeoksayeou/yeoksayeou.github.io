百濟의 特色을 具備한 百濟의 美術, 朝鮮美術의 史的 考察 -(其八)-
						朴鍾鴻

Paekche's founder, Onjo, who crossed the two waters of the P'aedae region and reached Hansan Mountain, established the capital at Hanam Wiryesŏng and laid the foundation of the nation. With the Han River to the north, high mountains to the east, and fertile plains and the great sea to the south and west, the strategic advantages of its formidable terrain allowed the people, who had worried about invasions from the two northeastern enemies, to pursue long-term peace. Thus, Paekche's culture began to emerge, and within it, the art we seek to study was conceived. It was natural for the Paekche people, who shared the same lineage and spirit as Koguryŏ, to establish the shrine of King Tongmyŏng, build palaces and city walls, and worship the founding queen mother. We can imagine that their construction methods and ceremonial customs followed the traditions passed down from their ancestors. Therefore, early Paekche art was similar to that of Koguryŏ and did not retain distinct characteristics. Later, during the middle period, Buddhism was first transmitted, but this too was similar to Koguryŏ, being Northern Buddhism. The historical records state:
"In the ninth month of the first year of King Ch'imnyu's reign, the foreign monk Maranant'a arrived from Jin. The King of Paekche welcomed him into the palace and treated him with reverence. Paekche Buddhism began from this time. In the second month of the spring of the second year, Paekche founded a Buddhist temple at Hansan and ordained ten monks."
The Buddhist temple first established at Hansan must have also been a structure following the same lineage, and consequently, other artistic items such as Buddhist statues would have been similar. The "Paekche art possessing Paekche's characteristics" that we intend to discuss is not transmitted among works after the arrival of Buddhism at that time, <1> and it is presumed to have been still rudimentary. Today, traces of ancient tomb clusters, like stone mound sites, are scattered near Kwangju, but there seems to be no material worth discussing.

During the reign of King Munju, unable to withstand the pressure from the powerful Koguryŏ, Paekche gradually moved south and finally established its capital at T'aejin, which is present-day Kongju. However, after less than five reigns, in the spring of the 16th year of King Sŏng, the capital was moved again to Sabi Castle, which is Puyŏ Castle, the final royal capital of Paekche. Starting from Pusosan Castle, an earthen wall was built along the high ridge running south, and one side was surrounded by the long flow of the Kŭm River. The method of fortification resembled that of Koguryŏ's Changansŏng (P'yŏngyang Castle).

Later, during King Sŏng's reign, the monk Kyŏmik traveled to Central India, studied the Vinaya texts deeply, and returned accompanied by the Indian monk Paedalt'a Samjang, translating 72 volumes of the Vinaya. Envoys were sent to Southern Liang to request Buddhist scriptures, artisans, painters, etc., providing an opportunity for the revival of Paekche Buddhism, which had been in decline. A brilliant culture flourished from this point, and its unique art radiated distinct colors.

While Koguryŏ achieved considerable accomplishments drawing from Northern artistic traditions, Paekche gathered the Southern culture of the East, extracting its essence and plucking its flowers, transforming it into its own inherent art. It opened a great global gateway in the silent southwestern fertile plains, and its far-reaching vision led its people to dedicate themselves to the propagation of culture. The historical records state:
"In the 30th year of King Sŏng, the King of Paekche presented Buddhist statues and scriptures to Japan, along with a letter saying, 'This dharma is the most excellent among all dharmas. Even the Duke of Zhou and Confucius could not know it. It can generate immeasurable merit and virtue and lead to the attainment of supreme enlightenment...' Japanese Buddhism began from this."
The culture of Fusang (Japan), which had been unenlightened, was thus bathed in the new light of dawn.

Section 1: Architecture

Near Kwangju, only dilapidated traces of ancient tombs remain, and near Kongju, only some pottery fragments are found. Both ruins and relics are incomplete, yet it is not impossible to roughly infer their lineage through observation. Therefore, studying the art after the capital was moved to Sabi Castle is most crucial. We must investigate the ruins near Puyŏ, the art of other lands related to Paekche during that period, and the path of development. <2>

Ruins within the Peninsula

Although Paekche's architecture has left almost no remains within the peninsula, its exquisite technique surpassed that of the other two kingdoms, and its surviving wooden structures are among the oldest and most complete, rare in the world. Imagining the construction of that era, undoubtedly grand palaces and temples, its representative buildings, would have brilliantly adorned the royal capital of Puyŏ. Their supreme religious faith seems to have dedicated even more care to the building and maintenance of Buddhist temples. King Pŏp and King Mu exhausted the nation's resources to complete Wanghŭng Temple. The historical records state:
"In the spring, first month of the second year of King Pŏp, Paekche founded Wanghŭng Temple and ordained thirty monks. In the spring, second month of the thirty-fifth year of King Mu, Paekche's Wanghŭng Temple was completed. The temple, overlooking the water, was extremely magnificent. Its construction began in King Pŏp's time and was completed now. The king often took a boat to the temple to offer incense."
Although it is recorded as magnificent, today even its traces are difficult to discern.

Nearby, only the base of one pagoda remains, which later generations named P'yŏngjet'ap (Pacifying Paekche Pagoda). It is a five-story pagoda reaching over 30 ch'ŏk (approx. 9-10 meters) in height. Its structure is simple, without elaborate techniques, but the corbels are thin, and the pagoda body is thick and straight, giving the entire form a grand, stable appearance. It must have been a lofty, sacred pagoda, an object of faith for the people of the capital, <3> a symbol of reverence. However, such is the cruelty of the world. It suffered the attack of the allied forces of Silla and Tang, and even the weakened remnants faced defeat and death in battle. The magnificent royal capital turned into a chaotic scene overrun by vicious bandits. This was the 5th year of the Tang Xianqing era. By the scheme of General Su Dingfang and others, the inscription "Great Tang Pacifies Paekche" (大唐平百濟) was carved on all four sides of the first story of this noble pagoda body. Thus, it came to be known by people as P'yŏngjet'ap, causing wandering visitors at sunset to be unable to suppress feelings of reminiscence.

Among other architectural structures, the Mirŭk Stone Pagoda in Iksan barely retains a partial form; it is the largest among stone pagodas. The interior of the first story has a cross-shaped passage, sufficient for standing and passing through, built with enormous stone materials.
Its collapse is severe, leaving only five stories, but it is uncertain whether it was originally a seven or nine-story pagoda. Regarding its construction date, popular legend attributes it to King Mukang of Mahan, who supposedly built it together with the renowned monk Chimyŏng Pŏpsa, and this seems to be believed without doubt. Of course, legends should not be dismissed outright as unbelievable; often they transmit truths, and trying to exclude them from ancient history <3> is unreasonable. However, when we examine this based on historical records and actual evidence, we find it difficult to readily accept. Why? Even the *Samguk Sagi* (History of the Three Kingdoms), considered authoritative among ancient historical records, has not a single line recorded about this. While some later historical books and geographical records occasionally transmit baseless legends nonchalantly, blindly passing them down and echoing each other is something we cannot praise. While acknowledging that Buddhism's eastward transmission began in the 2nd year of King Sosurim of Koguryŏ, accepting this claim [about Mahan] seems contradictory. Even if we concede, for argument's sake, that Buddhism was already practiced during the Mahan period, could it have arrived without passing through the northern land route, which had frequent contact with the continent, at a time when seafaring skills were rudimentary? Didn't the Paedal people move south from the north and begin to build a new culture? It must inevitably be dated after King Ch'imnyu of Paekche, and furthermore, after the move to Sabi Castle. The *Samguk Yusa* (Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms), under the entry for King Mu of Paekche, states:
"Upon ascending the throne, one day the King and his Queen wished to visit Sajasa Temple. When they reached the large pond at the foot of Yonghwasan Mountain, three Maitreya images appeared in the pond. They stopped their carriage and paid reverence. The Queen said to the King, 'We must build a great temple on this spot; it is truly my wish.' The King agreed. He went to the monk Chimyŏng and asked about filling the pond. With supernatural power, Chimyŏng leveled the mountain and filled the pond overnight, making it flat ground. Then, images of the three Maitreyas, halls, pagodas, and corridors were each built in three locations, and the temple was named Mirŭksa. King Chin P'yŏng [of Silla] sent many craftsmen to help. The temple exists to this day."
Although this too contains absurdities that are hard to believe, it is worth considering that the temple was likely built around this period. In recent years, some claim, based on the structure and style of the stone pagoda, that it belongs to the early Silla unification period. However, we find it difficult to dispel our doubts. Why?
Among the outstanding pagodas of the Silla unification period, we can cite the Sŏkkat'ap and Tabot'ap at Pulguksa Temple. How do they compare to the Mirŭk Pagoda? At a glance, one recognizes the distinct difference in the intricacy of their techniques. If one is considered an embodiment of grand beauty, the other expresses graceful beauty. If the Mirŭk Pagoda were built immediately after unification, the two pagodas at Pulguksa were constructed during the reign of King Kyŏngdŏk, a gap of only about 5 reigns or 60-odd years. We doubt such a drastic change could occur during that time, as the art world was progressing from its burgeoning phase into a period of maturity.
However, when compared to the P'yŏngjet'ap, one discovers a strong resemblance in the proportion of the pagoda body and corbels, and in the structure. The use of massive stone materials to build on a grand scale with boldness suggests that its date should be pushed further back. If our observation is correct, <4> this pagoda would be the largest stone pagoda on the peninsula and one of the oldest.
Due to severe collapse, the authorities, expressing the intention to preserve the old site, seem to have dared to undertake repairs some years ago. It was supported with steel frames and built up with cement. Viewed from the west, it resembles a giant mound of lime, causing visitors seeking the pagoda to perform a comical act of disappointment at first sight. Only by moving several dozen paces to the northeast can one barely glimpse a partial form and imagine the whole. Can this really be called suitable under the name of preserving the old site?
The authorities seem to have established a so-called "Committee for the Investigation of Ancient Sites." Of course, it is not that it hasn't produced some results, but it seems they rigidly adhere to the name "investigation" and only go as far as investigating, without advancing a single step towards considering proper preservation methods. Are they relying on the almost nominal groups called "Preservation Societies for Scenic Spots and Historic Sites" that exist here and there? Perhaps they don't know. Is it because scenic spots and historic sites have considerable economic relations with the local people, and they expect the people to protect them voluntarily? For scenic spots and historic sites, perhaps this is acceptable. But are artistic ruins and relics valuable simply because they look ancient and venerable? Surely they can distinguish artistic artifacts from scenic spots and historic sites. Their negligence is easily observable; one feels this at famous temples and laments it at the so-called museums in the capital and provinces. We are indeed laymen concerning them. However, we can appreciate the difficulties due to lack of funds and the challenges of rebuilding and repairs. Yet, temporary plastering is not a strategy for long-term economy, and preservation and exhibition methods without due consideration will fail to convey the original intent – this much we can imagine.
Our art embodies and represents the taste of the entire East. Its past relics are priceless treasures that still have the most significant contribution to make to world culture. How can their preservation methods be treated carelessly? <5> Furthermore, these relics, which represent the grand national character expressed globally through the sincere life of the Paedal people, should truly be transmitted for myriad generations. Let the praiseworthy deed of preservation not create regrets for a thousand years.
Underground structures (tombs) generally retain the same form as those of Koguryŏ. Although the entrance passage being on one side and the simpler corbelling are slight differences, the construction using large, fine granite blocks and the polished wall surfaces reflecting faces are things already seen in the Three Tombs of Kangsŏ. Thus, their lineage can be studied, especially felt in the brushwork and patterns of the murals. The four guardian deities are painted on the walls, and cloud patterns, lotus patterns, etc., are depicted on the ceiling, <5> showing not only similarity to Koguryŏ but also considerable connection to the art of Fusang's (Japan's) so-called Asuka period. Precious burial goods mostly disappeared during the Tang invasion, and hardly any remain today; only wooden coffins and metal fittings have been discovered.
The numerous tile fragments collected near Pusosan Castle resemble those found at Hōryūji Temple in Nara in form and pattern. From this too, we can infer the considerable mutual relationship. Here, I will briefly describe the relationship between Paekche and Japan and proceed further to study it, also in the sense that it is Paekche art.

Ancient Temples of Fusang (Japan)

It would not be an exaggeration to say that Japan's ancient general culture, regardless of the aspect, was entirely formed by our Paedal people, who took their models for crafts from here – this is discussed by both sides. Among them, the one that had the closest relationship and made the greatest contribution was Paekche. This was frequently seen even before the transmission of Buddhism. It is well known that the great Paekche scholar Wangin brought 10 volumes of the Analects and 1 volume of the Thousand Character Classic, initiating the transmission of Confucianism to Japan. This is enough to imagine the great cultural revolution that must have occurred. At that time, the artisans Han'gye T'akso (a smith) and Obok Sŏso (a weaver) also accompanied him. Thus, Japan borrowed Paekche's strength in metallurgy and weaving. Even before that, there was mention of seamstresses (縫衣工女), suggesting that the art of tailoring was also transmitted after being sought from Paekche. Indeed, at that time, their material culture was undeveloped, and they were still struggling just to meet the needs of food, clothing, and shelter; this was quite natural.
After Buddhism was officially transmitted, the turmoil of local politics and friction among court officials led factions to form, vying for power. This produced pro-Buddhist factions embracing the new and anti-Buddhist factions clinging to tradition. The intense confrontation between them continued for several generations. Epidemics and the destruction of temples and Buddhist statues caused fear among the populace, whose thinking was still immature, eventually leading them to take refuge in Buddhism. Furthermore, as the pro-Buddhist faction gained political power and established the foundation for Buddhism's prosperity, it must have become a major force in society at that time. Consequently, the people, who had adhered to simple, small-scale, worldly ideas and devoted all their energy to worshipping gods, believing fortune and misfortune were acts of divine will, came to pray for the nation's peace and stability by revering dignified Buddhist and Bodhisattva images in great temples with red railings and painted pillars. <6>
In the 32nd year of King Sŏng, high monks such as Tamhye and Tosim were dispatched from Paekche. In the 24th year of King Widŏk, scriptures, treatises, and monks were sent again, accompanied by Buddhist image makers and temple carpenters, who resided at Naniwa Daibetsuō-ji Temple. The *Wakan Sansai Zue* records:
"In the 6th year of Emperor Bidatsu, Buddhist image makers and temple carpenters first came from the country of Paekche to build Daiō-ji Temple. For various temples, carpenters and tile makers were summoned from the country of Paekche. The tile makers of Ōsaka in Settsu Province today are their descendants."
Even tile makers crossed over, setting the standard for the craft and becoming the ancestors for later generations. Buddhist temples built by Paekche artisans – it is no surprise that Paekche-style temples were constructed. Indeed, if one were to extract Paekche art from the art of Japan's Asuka period, what would remain would be only dark shadows.
What had been considered elaborate design was merely their indigenous simple, rectilinear architecture similar to their shrines. From this point, it leaped forward to progress into architecture featuring the complex beauty of curved, tiled roofs. At that time, Buddhism was reaching the peak of its prosperity in the three kingdoms of the peninsula, leading to intense competition in missionary activities. Paekche was the one that communicated with neighboring countries, leaped overseas, and held the position of superiority among them. In the 34th year of King Widŏk, temple carpenters and painters also crossed over. The *Wakan Sansai Zue* states:
"From the country of Paekche, temple carpenters T'aeryang, Malt'amun, and Kagogoja, and painter Paegya entered Japan."
This was the spring of the first year of Japan's Emperor Sushun. In the winter of the same year, Prince Shōtoku founded Shitennōji Temple. This serves as a reference for imagining the Paekche-style Shitennōji. Five years later, in the first year of Empress Suiko, Shitennōji was moved to Naniwa Arasaka. Its layout is recorded as having one five-story tiled pagoda and one two-story tiled Golden Hall (Kondō), along with a Lecture Hall (Kōdō) and Dining Hall (Jikidō). A covered corridor (horō) of 80 ken (approx. 145m) with tiled roofing encircled it, and one two-story Middle Gate (Chūmon) was erected. This is the same layout as Hōryūji Temple. It also allows us to imagine the architectural methods of the Three Kingdoms period. This reflects the changing conception of the pagoda over time. That is, centering the layout on the pagoda was generally the early method. Later, with the need for halls, a method centering on both the Golden Hall and the pagoda began, as seen at Shitennōji and Hōryūji. This was the Paekche temple construction method, and further, the style of temple complexes during the Three Kingdoms period might have been like this. This type of style gradually evolved, due to the expansion of temple complexes and elaborate design, so that the hall became the central building, and the pagoda came to be treated almost as an accessory or a decorative structure for the hall. However, the change in pagoda structure from the stupa shape to three, five, or even seven or nine stories, <7> with the original form barely entrusted to the finial (sōrin), had already occurred before its arrival on the peninsula. But features like erecting twin pagodas in front of the hall to achieve left-right balance seem to be developments after its eastward transmission.
As mutual exchange became frequent, even monks and nuns came from Japan to Paekche to seek the Dharma. The *Genkō Shakusho* states:
"Nun Zenshin was the daughter of Sima Tattō and others. In the 13th year of Emperor Bidatsu, she became a nun under Hyeppyŏn, along with two companions. They shaved their heads together. One was Zenzo, daughter of Yason of Liang; the second was Ezen, daughter of Nishikori. Minister Soga no Umako built a monastery, invited the three nuns, and supported them. In the 2nd year of Emperor Yōmei, Zenshin said to Umako, 'For those who have left home, the precepts are the foundation. I wish to go to Paekche to receive the precepts and study.' In the 1st year of Emperor Sushun, Umako entrusted Zenshin to the Paekche envoy and sent her off to seek the Dharma. In the spring of the 3rd year, Zenshin and the other two nuns returned from Paekche and resided at Sakurai-dera Temple."
Zenshin became a nun at age 11, and at 15, she traveled to Paekche to study the precepts for three years before returning. This was during the reign of Emperor Sushun. That such a remarkable feat occurred when the transmission of Buddhism was still recent is sufficient to gauge the immense expectations Japan had of Paekche. What kind of stimulus must the young nun Zenshin have provided to the people of Fusang? Consequently, Paekche must have been revered by the general populace for both its teachings and its culture.
Based on the relationship between the two countries described above, we do not doubt that Daiwa Hōryūji Temple, completed over the period from the first year to the 15th year of Empress Suiko's reign, was built by Paekche people. Furthermore, inferring from the style, Hōrinji Temple and Hōkiji Temple, completed shortly thereafter, are likely the same. Therefore, we intend to examine them to explore the nature of wooden architecture at that time.
Passing through the village streets of Hōryūji station, hastening one's steps along a path through scattered pines, embraced by the secluded and quiet atmosphere, and gazing at the nine rings of the five-story pagoda towering ahead, one cannot help but feel a desolate sense of nostalgia. An illusion arises, as if visiting a temple in the Paekche homeland during the Three Kingdoms period. Is it a connection of blood, or a communion of spirit? Perhaps the trace of being a pilgrim in a foreign land disappears. Entering through the South Great Gate (Nandaimon), the two-story Middle Gate (Chūmon) stands directly in front. Corridors extend left and right, connecting to the Lecture Hall (Kōdō) at the rear. Within this enclosure, the Golden Hall (Kondō) and the Five-Story Pagoda stand opposite each other, east and west. The planar layout possesses its characteristic feature here. Examining its structure further, the pillars of the upper and lower stories are unconnected. The roof slope is gentle, presenting a solemn exterior while not losing the graceful smoothness of curved beauty. Moreover, regarding the details of craftsmanship, the lattice of the railings (kōran no rankan) forms a special pattern resembling a swastika (卍字), which is a characteristic feature of the time. Although finding similar examples elsewhere is difficult, <8> on the peninsula, this exquisite method is still applied to railings, furniture, decorative items, etc., even today. The pillars bulge in the central part, <8> possessing the so-called "entasis." The stable appearance and sturdy dynamism correspond well with the elegant railings. This too evokes the architecture of the Western Regions and is sufficient for tracing its lineage. On the peninsula, cylindrical pillars with entasis were used from the Three Kingdoms period through the Silla unification period to the Koryŏ period; an example can be seen at Muryangsujeon Hall of Pusŏksa Temple in Yŏngju.
The lower two stories of the three-story pagoda at Hōrinji and the three-story pagoda at Hōkiji retain their original form from Japan's Suiko period when they were founded. All transmit the same techniques as Hōryūji. Currently, only these three-story pagodas remain. However, they possess consistent characteristics such as cylindrical pillars with entasis and railings with lattices resembling the swastika pattern. Their original temple complex form can be imagined by reference to Hōryūji. The robust and simple techniques did not retain the ugly decorations and vulgar skills seen in later periods but were solely bold and vigorous.
The above is a study of the ancient temples of Fusang, renowned as the world's oldest surviving wooden structures, which are relics of Paekche artists. Having gained an overview of Paekche-period wooden architecture, we now intend to gradually discuss the architects.

Architects

Even from this brief and insufficient study, we aim to investigate the historical traces of the development of the Paedal people's aesthetic consciousness. Therefore, we must infer the characteristics of the era expressed in artistic relics and examine the historical circumstances behind the production of those artworks. Consequently, it is necessary to explore the development circumstances and history of the artists, and furthermore, clearly demonstrate the influence the artworks had on their contemporary society and the impact they transmitted to the art world of later generations. However, given the rarity of artistic relics and ruins and the lack of reliable historical records, we anticipated the difficulty of realizing this, and we have already cited numerous similar examples. <9>
There is no record transmitted about the Paekche architects who formed the art world of a foreign land and became its progenitors, except for the mention that the three temple carpenters T'aeryang, Malt'amun, and Kagogoja crossed over. This too falls under the category of unrecorded examples. Regarding Ap'iji, the architect of rare talent who was invited with treasures and silk from Silla to construct the nine-story pagoda at Hwangnyongsa Temple, his story is transmitted through a legend involving a strange dream. The *Samguk Yusa* states: <9>
"Queen Sŏndŏk discussed [the building of the pagoda] with her ministers. The ministers said, 'It will only be possible if we request an artisan from Paekche.' Therefore, treasures and silk were sent to Paekche to make the request. The artisan's name was Ap'iji. He accepted the commission and came. He managed the wood and stone work. Igan Yongch'un supervised the project, leading 200 junior artisans. On the day the central pillar was first erected, the artisan dreamed of the destruction of his home country, Paekche. His heart filled with doubt, and he stopped his hands. Suddenly, a great earthquake shook the land, and amidst the darkness, an old monk and a strong man emerged from the Golden Hall gate and erected the pillar. The monk and the strong man both vanished and were not seen again. Thereupon, the artisan repented and completed the pagoda."
The inner world of an artist is indeed difficult to fathom by ordinary standards. Often, this is dismissed as the result of delusion, or doubted as some kind of miracle. However, if we shift our perspective and infer the true inner feelings, it is vividly clear that this describes the process of Paekche architect Ap'iji's anguish regarding expression.
Similar to how the Koguryŏ painter Tamjing depicted Buddhist paintings, the Paekche architect Ap'iji built a Buddhist pagoda. One was called Master Tamjing (釋曇徵), while the other is recorded as Artisan Ap'iji (工匠 阿非知). Was Ap'iji inferior to others in religious faith? No. His even more ardent, devoted faith symbolized itself and created the dream, generating an incredible spiritual power that ultimately allowed him to complete his work. How could those bound by worldly fame and fortune, laboring under such entanglements, possibly attempt to reach such heights? Ap'iji, who tasted joy and pleasure amidst the fluctuations of aesthetic emotion and entrusted infinite hope to eternal light through natural expression, finally realized for Queen Sŏndŏk of Silla, who worried about her lack of authority as a female ruler, a great symbol capable of controlling the rampant neighboring enemies.
Viewed from this perspective, one can observe the shift in thought regarding general art, which transcended practical utility and appreciative entertainment. Embracing a passion like throwing oneself into a blazing fire, standing outside concerns of rise and fall, prosperity and decline, life and death, profit and loss, as religious faith grew increasingly intense daily, they left no base or ugly stains. Instead, with only a reverent and sincere attitude, they devoted their entire energy to creation.
(To be continued) <10>

**Summary**

This article, part eight of a series on Korean art history, focuses on the art of the Paekche kingdom. It traces Paekche's origins, its initial cultural similarity to Koguryŏ, and the pivotal role of Buddhism (introduced first from Jin, then significantly revitalized through contact with Southern Liang) in shaping a distinct Paekche artistic identity, particularly after the capital moved to Sabi (Puyŏ). The author emphasizes Paekche's sophisticated craftsmanship, especially in architecture, citing remains like P'yŏngjet'ap and the massive Mirŭkt'ap in Iksan, while critiquing contemporary (1922) preservation efforts. A significant portion details Paekche's crucial role in transmitting Buddhism, Confucianism, and associated arts and crafts (architecture, sculpture, painting, even tile-making) to early Japan (Asuka period), arguing that Japanese temples like Hōryūji are essentially Paekche works. The piece concludes by highlighting the dedication and spiritual depth of Paekche artisans like Ap'iji, contrasting their focus on creation with worldly concerns. From a colonial history perspective, the article is interesting for its assertion of Korean cultural superiority and influence over Japan, directly countering Japanese colonial narratives that often minimized or ignored this. The critique of preservation practices likely targets the Japanese colonial administration, subtly asserting Korean ownership and concern for its heritage. The emphasis on Paekche's unique artistic achievements serves a nationalist purpose, bolstering Korean cultural identity during a period of occupation.

百濟의 特色을 具備한 百濟의 美術, 朝鮮美術의 史的 考察 -(其八)-
						朴鍾鴻
浿帶의 二水를 渡하야 漢山에 至한 百濟의 始祖, 溫祚가 河南 慰禮城에 都하야 建國의 礎를 立하니 北으로 漢水를 帶하고 東은 高嶽에 據하며 南과 西는 沃野와 大海를 望할 새 天險地利의 奇가 東北二寇의 侵軼을 慮하든 民人으로 하야곰 久安을 圖케 하도다. 이에 百濟의 文化가 始生하니 吾人의 究코저 하는 바- 그의 美術도 그 中에 胚胎된지라. 東明王의 廟를 立하며 城闕을 營하고 國母를 祀함과 如함은 高句麗와 族이 同하며 氣를 連한 百濟人의 當然한 事이어니와 그 築造의 法과 行事의 習이 先人의 遺風을 傳하얏슴에 想至할지니 初期의 美術이 高句麗와 相類하야 顯殊한 그의 特徵을 不留하얏든 것이라 하노라. 그 後 中世에 至하야 佛法이 始傳하얏스나 此亦 高句麗와 似하야 北方佛敎이엇나니 史記에 曰,
枕流王 元年 九月, 胡僧摩羅難陀, 自晉至, 百濟王迎致宮內, 禮敬焉, 百濟佛法始此. 二年春二月, 百濟創佛寺於漢山, 度僧十人.
漢山에 初創한 佛寺도 亦是 同一한 系統을 傳한 建築物이엇슬지며 딸하 佛像等 諸他 美術品도 亦然한 者이엇슬 것이라. 吾人의 論究코저 하는 바-「百濟의 特色을 具備한 百濟의 美術」은 當時 佛敎渡來以後의 作品으로서도 傳함이＜1＞ 無하거니와, 아즉 幼稚한 者로 推定되는 바이요. 今에 廣州附近에 古墳羣의 痕跡과 如한 石堆場이 散在하나 別로 論擧할 만한 材料도 無한 듯하도다.
文周王時에, 强盛한 高句麗의 迫來를 不堪하야 漸次 南下할 새 드듸어 態津에 都하얏나니 今日의 公州가 是也라. 然이나 5代를 經치 못 하야 聖王 16年 春에 更히 泗泚城으로 遷하니 百濟 最後의 王道인 扶餘城이라. 扶蘇山城으로 起하야 南走한 高陵에 土城을 築하고 一面은 錦江의 長流로 繞하니 築城의 法이 高句麗의 長安城(平壤城)과 類하또다.
그 後 聖王時에 至하야는 沙門·謙益이 中印度에 渡하야 律部를 深攻한 後 梵僧倍達多三藏을 件歸하야 律部 72卷을 譯하며 南梁에 使를 遣하야 佛法과 工匠, 畵師 等을 請來함으로 中廢하얏든 百濟의 佛敎가 復興의 機를 得하니 燦然한 文化가 此에 大開케 되엇스며 獨特한 그의 美術이 此에 異彩를 發케 되도다.
高句麗는 北方的 美術의 含蓄이 그 不少한 功蹟을 做成하얏거니와 百濟는 東洋의 南方的 文化를 具聚하야 그 精을 採하고 華를 摘하야 固有한 그 美術로 化하얏스며, 沈黙하든 西南의 沃野에 世界的 大門戶를 開放하야 그들의 遠大한 活目은 文化의 宣傳에 犧牲이 됨으로 自處하니 史記에 曰
聖王 三十年, 百濟王以佛像經卷, 贈於日本, 且貽書曰, 是法於諸法中, 最爲殊勝, 周公·孔子, 尙不能知, 能生無量福德, 成就無上菩提云云, 日本佛敎始干此.
濛昧하던 扶桑의 文化는 此에 依하야 生新의 曙光에 浴케 되도다.

第 一 建築

廣州附近에는 荒頹한 古墳의 遺痕을 留存하고 公州附近에는 陶器의 破片을 若干 發見할 뿐이라. 遺跡으로나 遺物로나 不完全함을 免치 못하는 者-며 또한 그 系統上으로 觀察하야 大略 聯測치 못할 바도 아니로다. 然則 泗泚城에 遷都한 以後의 美術을 考究함이 最緊하니 吾人은 扶餘附近의 遺跡과 當代에 百濟와 關聯된 他邦의 美術及 發達의 經路를 探覈치 아니치 못할지라.＜2＞

半島內의 遺跡

百濟의 美術中 建築은 비록 半島內에 留함이 殆無하나 그 精妙한 技術이 三國中에 冠하얏스며 그 遺存 上木造의 建築物로서 最古하고 完全하기 世界에 稀類한 者 - 라. 今에 그 當世의 築造를 推想할진대, 勿論 宏大한 宮闕과 寺刹等 그의 代表的 建物이 扶餘의 王都를 燦爛케 하얏슬 것이니 그들의 至高한 宗敎的 信仰은 佛寺의 修營에 一層 그 心慮를 配한듯 하도다. 法王과 武王이 國力을 盡하야 王興寺를 成하니 史記에 曰
法王二年春正月, 百濟創王興寺, 度僧三十人. 武王三十五年春二月, 百濟王興寺成, 寺臨水窮, 極壯麗, 創自法王時, 至是告成, 王每乘舟, 入寺行香.
비록 壯麗하얏섯다고 傳하나 今에 그 形跡조차 難辨이오.
近傍에 一基의 塔婆를 遺할 뿐이니 後人이 名 曰, 平濟塔이라. 全高가 30餘尺에 至하는 五重의 塔으로 그 構造가 單純하야 奇巧를 施함이 無하나 「코-벨」이 梢薄하고 塔身이 厚直함으로 全形이 雄大, 安固의 狀을 持하도다. 崇偉한 靈塔으로 王都人士의 信仰의 的이 되엇슬지요. 膽慕의 標가 되엇슬 것이다. 然而 世俗의 無慘함이어. 一旦에 新羅와 唐의 聯合軍의 襲來를 蒙하야 微衰한 殘衆까지 戰斃의 敗를 當하니 雄麗하든 王都는 凶賊의 亂巷으로 變하도다. 時는 唐 顯慶 5年이라. 其將蘇定方等의 謀에 依하야 高貴하든 此 塔身에 「大唐平百濟」의 題로 初層四面에 銘文을 彫留하니 이에 世人으로 하야곰 平濟塔이라 전케 되엇스며 日暮의 漫客으로 하야곰 追懷의 情을 禁치 못하게 하도다.
此外의 建築物로는 益山, 彌勒石塔이 片形을 僅留하니 石塔 中 最大한 者-라. 初層의 內部는 十字形의 通路를 作할새 可히 立하야 通함에 足하니 巨大한 石材로서 築上하도다.
頹崩이 滋甚하야 不過 5層을 遺存할 뿐이나 或은 7層이나 9層의 塔婆나 아니엇는가 未確한 者-라. 今에 創建한 年代를 考하건대 世人의 傳說하는 馬韓 武康王이 知名法師와 力을 合하야 所築한 것이라 하며 또한 信하야 疑함이 無한듯 하도다. 勿論 傳說이라 하야 可信치 못할 바-는 아니라. 돌이어 眞을 傳함이 不少하며 古史에서 此를 除코저＜3＞ 함도 無理한 事-어니와 吾人은 此를 史乘에 據하며 實跡에 依하야 觀之하매 容易하게 是認키 猝難한 者-라 하노니 何故오. 古代의 史乘中의 權威라 하는 三國史記에도 此等에 對하야는 半行의 記錄을 不見할지며 後代의 若干한 史冊과 地誌中 間或 根據도 無한 傳說을 泰然히 傳함이 有하니 眞僞의 與否도 不問하고 相傳하며 互應한다 함은 吾人의 可히 贊치 못할 바-라. 佛敎의 東渡가 高句麗 小獸林王 2年에 비롯하얏슴을 證하면서 此를 是認한다 함은 그 矛盾됨이 아닐가. 假使 一步를 讓하야 馬韓時에 佛法이 旣行하얏다 하면 航海의 術이 穉微하든 當時에 大陸과 交通이 頻繁하든 北部의 陸路를 不經하고 至하얏슬 것이라. 北方으로부터 倍達族이 南下하야 비롯오 新文化를 建設케 되엇슴이 아닌가. 不可不 百濟 枕流王 以後로 推定할지며, 더욱 泗泚城에 遷都한 以後라 할지로다. 三國遺事 百濟 武王 條下에 曰,
卽王位. 一日王與夫人, 欲幸師子寺, 至龍華山下大池邊, 彌勒三尊出現池中, 留驚致敬. 夫人謂王曰, 須創大伽藍於此地, 固所願也, 王許之. 詣知命所, 問塡池事, 以神力一夜頹山塡池爲平地, 乃法像彌勒三尊, 殿塔廊廡各三所創之, 額曰彌勒寺. 眞平王遣百工助之, 至今存其寺.
此亦 可히 信키 難한 荒說이 不無하나 大略 此時代에 建立된 者임은 一考에 値할 만한 者-라. 近年에 至하야는 그 石塔의 構造와 形式으로 推하야써 新羅統一時代 初期에 屬하는 者-라 或 稱하나, 吾人의 疑惑을 減키 難한 바-니 何故오.
今에 新羅統一時代의 塔婆中 優秀한 作品으로는 佛國寺 釋迦塔과 多寶塔을 擧할지라. 彌勒塔과 比하야 果然 如何한가. 一見에 그 技巧의 精妙함이 判異함을 認할지니 一을 壯美의 具顯된 者-라 하면 一은 優美를 表現하는 者-라 할지로다. 彌勒塔으로 하야곰 統一 後 即時 建立한 者-라 할진대 佛國寺의 二塔은 景德王 時에 築成한 者인즉 그 間이 約 5代 60餘年에 不過할지요. 美術界의 勃興時代로부터 圓熟期에 漸入한 當時나 變遷의 過甚함을 疑하는 바-로다.
然而此를 平濟塔에 比할 時는 塔身과 「코-벨」의 比例와, 構造에 在하야 그 酷似함을 發見할지니 그 巨大한 石材를 大膽하게 宏壯한 規模로써 築上한 等은 年代의 一層 遡古할 것임을 可測할지라. 吾人의 觀察이 得當하다 할지면＜4＞此 塔은 半島중 最大한 石塔이며 最古한 塔中의 一이 될지로다.
頹崩이 酷甚함으로 年前에 當局에서는 舊跡을 保存한다는 意를 表하야 修築을 敢行한 듯 하도다. 鐵骨로써 支하고 「세멘트」로써 築한지라. 西側으로 此를 望하면 宛然한 石灰의 巨陵과 如하야 塔은 訪問하든 者-一見 失望의 滑稽를 演할지요. 東北으로 數十間을 隔하야 비롯오 片形을 僅窺하며 全形을 推想할 뿐이라. 그 또한 舊跡을 保存한다는 名義에 適한다 稱할 者-랴.
當局에는 所謂 古蹟調査會라는 것을 置한듯 하도다. 勿論 多少間 그 功效가 顯出치 아니함은 아니나, 오즉 그 調査라는 名字를 固守하야 調査함에 至할 뿐이오. 一步나 그 保存法에 留意함에까지는 進치 못한듯 하도다. 處處에 名勝舊蹟保存會라는 幾乎 有名無實한 團合이 有하다 하야 그를 恃함인가. 或은 不知케라. 名勝舊蹟이라는 것이 그 地方人民과 經濟上 關係가 不少하다 하야 그 民人이 自發的으로 保護함을 期함인가. 名勝舊蹟이라면 또한 可하도다. 美術的 遺跡과 遺物이 古色이 蒼然함으로써 貴함이 되는가. 美術品을 名勝舊蹟과 分辨치 못함은 아닐 것이라. 等閑함을 可히 察함에 足할지니, 有名하다는 寺刹에서 此를 感하며 京鄕의 所謂 博物舘어라 稱하는 곳에서 此를 하歎하는 바-로다. 吾人은 그들에 대하야 과연 門外漢이라. 然이나 經費의 困乏함과 改築, 修繕等의 不容易할 것은 斟酌치 못하는 바도 아니어니와 一時的의 塗裝이 永年의 經濟를 爲하는 策이 아니며 顧慮함이 無한 保存과 陳列의 法이 그 本意를 傳치 못할 것임도 推想치 못하는 바가 아니로다.
우리의 美術은 全東洋的 趣味를 代表하야 軆現된 者-요. 그 過去의 遺物로서 오히려 世界文化에 貢獻할 바-最重한 絶寶가 될지라. 豈可以 保存의 法을 庶忽에 附할 者-랴. 더욱 倍達의 民人이 眞實한 生活을 함으로부터 雄大한 그 民族性이 世界的으로 表現한 此의 遺物은 實로 萬世에 傳할지니 保存한다는 그 美擧로 하야곰 千歲의 後悔를 作함이 無케 할지로다.
地下의 營造도 大槪 高句麗와 同一한 形式을 遺한 者-니 羡道가 片側으로 通하며 「코-벨」이 簡單함 等은 稍異하되 그 巨大한 花崗石의 良材로서 築上하며 壁面을 水磨하야 顔貌가 映寫함 等은 江西의 三墓에서 旣見한 者-라 考하야 그 系統을 可究할지니 더욱 그 壁畵의 筆法과 紋樣等에서 此를 感할지로다. 壁面에는 四神圖를 畵하며 天井에는＜5＞ 雲模樣, 蓮花紋樣等을 寫할새 高句麗와 近似할 뿐 아니라 扶桑의 所謂 飛鳥時代의 美術과도 不少한 關係를 有한 者인듯 하도다. 貴重한 副葬品等은 唐軍의 侵入時 奪去의 難을 當하야 尙存하는 者-殆無하니 木棺과 金具類를 發見할 뿐이라.
扶蘇山城의 附近에서 多數 採得한 瓦片은 形式과 模樣等이 奈良法隆寺에서 見하는 바와 相類하니 此에 由하야서도 그 互相의 關係가 不尠하얏슴을 可히 窺得할지로다. 玆에 百濟와 日本과의 關係를 略述하고 一步를 進하야 그 또한 百濟의 美術이라는 意味에서 그를 考究코저 하노라.

扶桑의 古刹

日本古代의 一般 文化가 何者를 莫論하고 全然 우리 倍達族에 依하야 形成되며 此에서 그 工藝의 範을 取하얏다 하야도 그 過言이 아닐지니 彼我가 相論하는 바-어니와 그 中에 在하야서도 一層 密接한 關係를 有하며 多大한 功勞를 作한 者는 百濟라. 佛法渡去 以前에 이미 此를 屢見하는 바-니 百濟의 碩儒 王仁이 論語 10卷과 千字文 1卷을 携渡함으로 日本에 儒敎가 始傳하얏슴은 世人의 熟知하는 바-라. 文化上에 一大 變革이 起하얏슬 것을 想함에 足할지오. 該時에 또한 手人韓鍜卓素와 吳服西素의 兩人이 伴行하얏섯도다. 如斯히 冶金으로 織造로 그 力을 百濟에 借하얏고 그 前에 縫衣工女의 稱이 旣有하니 裁縫의 術까지도 그에 求함으로부터 그 妙를 傳함인듯 하도다. 果然 當時는 그들의 文物이 未開한지라. 衣食住의 需要에 尙且汲汲하얏슬 뿐이니 또한 그 當然한 바-라 한진뎌.
그後 佛法이 公式으로 傳하매 地方政治의 紊亂과 朝臣間의 軋轢으로 各各 黨派를 結하야 朝權을 爭奪하든 臣民은 新進的의 崇佛派와 保守的의 排佛派를 做出하니 互相間의 劇烈한 對抗은 數代間을 繼續한 者이엇도다. 疾疫의 流行과 寺塔佛像等의 破壞는 一般 思想이 幼穉하든 그 民人으로 하야곰 恐怖心을 生케 하야 드듸어 佛法에 歸依함에 至하니 더욱 崇佛派가 政權을 掌握케 되며 그 興隆의 基本을 確立함에 至하야는 當時 社會에 一大勢力을 作하얏슬 것이라. 이에 現世的 小規模의 單純한 思想의 把住者로 그 全力을 神의 祭祀에 供하야써 吉凶禍福을 神慮의 所作이라하든 그 民人은 相貌端嚴한 佛菩薩을 朱欄丹楹의 大伽藍에 拜敬하야 國家의 安穩을 祈願함에 至하얏도다.＜6＞
聖王 32年에는 百濟로부터 曇惠, 道深等의 高僧을 遣하얏스며 威德王 24年에는 또 經論과 沙門을 送하고 佛工과 寺匠等을 伴行케 할새 難波大別王寺에 住하니 和漢三才圖會에는 傳하되
敏達 6年, 始自百濟國, 佛工, 寺匠來爲造大王寺, 處處伽藍, 召土木瓦工於百濟國 今攝州大坂瓦工, 其傳統也.
甚至於 瓦工까지 渡하야 그 法의 標範을 乘하며 後世의 祖宗이 되엇도다. 百濟 工匠의 手營한 佛寺의 建築이라. 百濟式의 伽藍이 造成되엇슴은 怪異함도 無할 것이어니와 何如컨 日本 飛鳥時代의 美術에서 百濟의 美術을 摘拔한다 하면 殘餘하는 바-오즉 暗黑한 影跡을 留할 것이라.
意匠을 盡하얏다 함이 겨우 그들의 所謂 神社와 似한 固有의 單純한 直線的 建築이든 것이 自此로 一躍하야 瓦葺의 複雜한 曲線의 美를 具한 建築으로 進步케 되엇도다. 當時 半島의 三國은 佛敎가 正히 興隆의 絶頂에 及할새 各各 布敎上의 一大 競爭을 行하얏나니 隣邦에 通하며 海外로 飛躍하야 그 中 優越의 權을 執하얏슴은 곳 百濟라. 威德王 34年에 또 寺工과 畵師等이 渡하니 和漢三才圖會에 云,
百濟國寺工, 太良·末太文·賈古子3人, 畫工 白如, 入日本.
此는 日本 崇峻帝 元年 春節이라. 同年 冬期에는 廐戶皇子가 四天王寺를 建立하얏스니 百濟樣式의 四天王寺를 推想함에 參考할 만한 者-라. 그 後 5年을 經하야 推古帝 元年에는 四天王寺를 難波荒陵下에 遷하니 그 堂宇의 配置를 記錄하되 五重瓦葺의 寶塔一基와 二重瓦葺의 金堂一宇를 建하며 그 外에 講堂과 食堂等이 有하고 瓦葺 80間의 步廊이 一廻할새 二重의 中門 一宇를 立하얏섯다함은 法隆寺의 配置法과 同一한 者-라. 또한 三國時代 建築法에 想及할지니 此는 塔婆에 對한 觀念의 推移함을 딸하 變遷한 것이라. 即 塔婆를 中心삼음이 大槪 初期의 法이요. 그 後 堂宇의 必要와 伴하야 金堂과 塔婆의 二者를 中心삼는 法이 始하니 此 四天王寺와 法隆寺에서 見하는 바-라. 此가 即 百濟의 寺刹建築法이며, 一步를 進하면 三國時代의 伽藍樣式이 如斯하얏슬 것이라. 此類의 樣式은 漸次 伽藍의 增築함과 意匠을 盡함으로 因하야 堂宇가 그 中心建物을 成하고 오히려 塔婆는 附屬物 或은 殿堂의 裝飾的 築造物가티 對함에 至하도다. 然而 그 塔婆의 構造도 浮屠形으로부터 三層, 五層 或은 七層이나 九層 等으로 變하고＜7＞本形을 겨우 相輪에 托함 등은 半島에 渡來하기 以前에 이미 變遷한 者-어니와 左右의 均衡을 得키 爲하야 堂前에 雙塔을 立함이 通例가 됨과 如함은 東渡以後에 變한 事實인 듯 하도다.
互相의 交通이 正히 頻繁하야지매 僧尼로서 百濟에 渡來하야 法을 求하는 者까지 出하니 元亨釋書에 云,
善信尼, 司馬達等之女也, 敏達13年, 從慧便出家, 同伴二女, 共薙髮, 一禪藏, 梁人夜善之女, 二慧善錦織之女, 大臣蘇馬子, 營精舍, 迎三尼, 供養. 用明2年, 信, 白馬子曰, 出家之人, 以戒爲地, 願赴百濟, 受戒學. 崇峻元年, 馬子付信百濟使, 求法發遣, 三年春, 信等三尼, 自百濟歸, 住櫻井寺.
善信은 女子로서 11歲에 出家하야 尼가 되고 15歲 時에는 百濟에 渡하야 戒律을 學하기 3年에 還하니 此는 崇峻帝時代라. 佛法의 渡去가 尙且日淺하든 그 時에 如斯한 壯擧가 有하얏슴은 日本이 百濟에 期待하든 바-莫大하엿슴을 斟酌함에 足하도다. 年少한 善信尼는 扶桑人民에 如何한 刺激을 寄與하얏슬 것일가. 딸하 百濟는 敎化로나 文物로나 一般人民의 瞻慕하기 마지아니하는 바이엇슬 지로다.
以上에 述한 바-兩國의 關係로부터 推하야 吾人은 玆에 推古帝 元年으로부터 同 15年에 亘하야 完成된 大和法隆寺가 百濟人의 造營한 바임을 疑心치 아니하며 그 後 未幾에 成한 法輪寺와 法起寺도 樣式으로 推하든지 亦然한 者인 것이라 하노니 卽 그를 考察하야 當時 木造建築의 性質을 探覈코저 하는 所以로다.
法隆寺驛의 村街를 貫하고 亂松의 一路에 步를 促하며 幽寂한 雰圍氣에 抱擁되어 前面에 聳立한 五重塔의 九輪을 望하면 蕭然한 懷古의 情緖를 스스로 斷치 못할지요. 三國時代의 百濟鄕土에 寺院을 訪하는 듯한 幻想이 起할지니 血의 緣함이 有한가, 氣의 通함이 在한가 異邦의 巡禮라는 或은 그 痕跡을 留함이 無하도다. 南大門으로 入하면 正面 二重의 中門이 立하고 左右로 步廊이 迴하야 背後의 講堂에 連接하며 그 繞圍中에 金堂과 五重塔이 東西에 對立하니 平面의 配置法에 그 特色을 具한 者-라. 다시 그 構造를 察할진대 上下層의 柱楹이 關聯됨이 無하고 屋蓋의 傾斜가 緩慢하야 莊重한 外觀을 呈하면서도 曲線美의 婉快함을 不失하고 더욱 그 細部으 技巧에 至하야는 句欄의 檽子가 卍字와 似한 一種의 特殊한 模樣으로 成하니 곳 當世의 一特色이라. 然而此는 他에 類例를 見키 難한 者-나 半島內에 在하야는 尙且 今日에 至하기까지 句欄과 家具, 裝飾品 等에 應用하야 그 妙法을 傳하는 者-로다. 柱楹은 中央部가＜8＞膨出하야 所謂 「엔타시스」 Entasis 를 有하니 安固한 狀과 勁健한 勢가 瀟灑한 句欄과 相應하도다. 此亦 西域의 建築法을 想케 하는 者-요. 因하야 그 系統을 探究함에 足한 者-라. 半島內에는 三國時代로부터 新羅統一時代를 經하야 高麗時代에 至하도록 「엔타시스」의 圓柱를 使用하얏나니 榮州 浮石寺, 無量壽殿에서 此例를 見함이로다.
法輪寺 三層塔의 二層이하와 法起寺의 三層塔은 創建한 日本 推古帝時代의 原形을 留하되 皆是 法隆寺와 同一한 手法을 傳하는 者-니 而今에 殘存하는 者가 그 等三層塔을 僅有할 뿐이라. 然而 그 「엔타시스」의 圓柱와 卍字形과 似한 句欄의 檽子를 有한 等 一致한 特色을 具備하도다. 그 伽藍의 本形을 法隆寺에 推하야 可히 想及할지니, 粗大하며 單拙한 手法은 後世에 見하는 바-醜雜한 裝飾과 俗劣한 技巧를 不留하고 오즉 大膽하며 雄健하얏섯도다.
以上은 現存한 世界 最古의 木造建築物로 擅名하는 바-百濟의 美術家의 遺物인 扶桑의 古刹에 對한 考察이라. 百濟時代의 木造建築의 槪念을 得한 吾人은 次에 建築家에 就하야 漸論코저 하는 바-로다.

建築家

吾人은 簡略하고 不充分한 此의 考察에서나마 倍達族의 審美的 意識이 發展한 史蹟을 究코저 하는 바-라. 故로 美術的 遺物上에 表現된 그 時代의 特徵을 推하며 그 美術品의 歷史的 産出의 所緣을 考覈치 아니치 못할지요. 딸하 美術家의 發達한 事情과 來歷을 探하며 더욱 그 美術品이 當時代에 寄與한 바 感化와 後代 美術界에 傳하는 바 影響 等을 明白히 論證할 必要가 有한 者-로다. 然이나 美術的 遺物과 遺跡의 稀貴하며 可信할 만한 史乘에 乏한 吾人은 此等의 實現키 難함을 豫想하얏고 또한 그의 類例를 이미 多數히 擧한 바-라.
外邦의 美術界를 形成하며 그의 祖宗이 된 百濟의 建築家로 傳함이 無하고 오즉 寺工 太良·末太文·賈古子의 3人이 渡去함을 記하얏슬 뿐이요. 此亦 不傳하는 例에 漏치 아니 하얏도다. 新羅의 寶帛으로써 請邀함을 受하야 皇龍寺 九層塔을 築造한 稀代의 建築家 阿非知에 對하야서도 그 夢幻의 怪異함으로써 傳說을 作하얏슴이라. 三國遺事에 曰, ＜9＞
善德王議於群臣, 羣臣曰, 請工匠於百濟然後方可, 乃以寶帛請於百濟, 匠名, 阿非知, 受命而來, 經營木石, 伊干龍春, 幹蠱, 率小匠二百人, 初立刹柱之日, 匠夢本國百濟滅亡之狀, 匠乃心疑停手, 忽大地震動, 晦冥之中, 有一老僧一壯士, 自金殿門出, 乃立其柱, 僧與壯士皆隱不現, 匠於是改悔, 畢成其塔.
美術家의 心事라는 것은 果然 世人의 常規로써 測키 難한 者-라. 往往 此를 妄想의 所致라 하야 排하며 或은 奇蹟模樣으로 此를 疑心하는 所以로다. 然이나 意趣의 所向을 一轉하야 內面의 眞情을 推察할진대 百濟의 建築家 阿非知의 그 表現에 對한 煩悶의 過程을 云謂한 者임이 歷歷然明白한 者-로다.
高句麗의 畵家 曇徵이 佛畵를 寫하얏슴과 似하야 百濟의 建築家 阿非知는 佛塔을 建하얏거니와 一은 釋曇徵이라 稱하얏고 一은 工匠의 阿非知라 傳하니 阿非知는 宗敎的 信仰에 在하야 他에게 遜後하는 者인가. 否라. 一層 熱烈한 그의 獻身的 信仰이 象徵化하야 夢幻을 作하얏고 오히려 不可思議한 靈力을 生하야 드듸어 그의 功을 完畢하얏도다. 一世의 名利에 束縛되어 그 繫累에 困勞한 者 等의 豈可以企圖하야 及할 바-리오. 審美的 感情의 浮動中에 欣喜와 悅樂을 嘗하며 그 自然的 表現으로부터 永遠한 光明에 無窮한 希望을 囑한 阿非知는 드듸어 女主로서 威가 無함을 慮하든 新羅의 善德女王으로 하야곰 隣寇의 縱橫을 制코저 할만한 偉大한 表象을 此에 實現한 者-라.
由是觀之컨대 實用的 功利를 歷하고 觀賞的 娛樂를 脫한 一般 藝術에 對한 思想의 遷移를 察할지니 熱火中에 投함과 如한 그 情을 擧하야 宗敎的 信仰이 日熾함을 딸하 興亡隆替와 生死利害의 外에 立하되 鄙醜한 汚點을 留함이 無하얏고 오즉 敬虔하며 眞摰한 態度로써 創造에 그의 全力을 盡하얏슬 뿐이로다.
