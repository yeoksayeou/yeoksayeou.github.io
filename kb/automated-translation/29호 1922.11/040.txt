The Impact of Tariff Revision on the Korean Industrial World
						Kim Kyu-ho

Originally, our Chosŏn's tariff system was based on agreed tariff regulations established through commercial treaties concluded with various nations 30 or 40 years ago, thus bearing a semi-permanent nature. However, according to the declaration made to the trading nations at the time of the annexation in August 1910, it was announced that Chosŏn would remain an independent customs territory for the next 10 years, following the existing tariff system. Consequently, the validity of these commercial treaties naturally expired on August 31, 1920, two years ago, and thus the freedom to revise the tariffs was obtained. Regarding how this should be revised, surveying public opinion at the time, the majority on the Japanese side advocated for some revision under the unified tariff principle (a principle aiming to abolish the tariff wall between Japan and Chosŏn and apply Japan's tariff system, enforced since Meiji 44 [1911], to Chosŏn). On the Korean side, everyone advocated for some revision under the independent tariff principle (a principle seeking to keep Chosŏn outside Japan's tariff zone, as before, and establish a separate tariff line considering Chosŏn's special economic circumstances). At that time, the Japanese government, regardless of how fervent Korean public opinion was and disregarding how Korean industry would be damaged, decided to adopt the unified tariff principle, albeit with some revisions. However, due to the expected deficit of 7 million won in revenue (around 5 million won at the time) resulting from the abolition of tariffs between Japan and Chosŏn, while an Imperial Decree No. 306 in August, Taishō 9 (1920) promulgated the application of Japanese tariff rates to Chosŏn for trade with foreign countries starting from August 29th of that year, the tariff system between Japan and Chosŏn could not be abolished. According to recent reports, regarding this abolition, the Government-General <9> is currently in consultation with the Japanese Ministry of Finance. It is said that among imported goods, taxes on alcohol and textiles will remain for the time being, but tariffs on all other goods are intended to be abolished from April 1, Taishō 12 (1923). After completing the investigation and submitting it to the Cabinet, they will seek the approval of the 46th Diet. Seen from this perspective, the Government-General shows an attitude of intending to fully implement the unified tariff system sooner or later. Therefore, it is necessary for us Koreans, who will be directly affected economically by this, to study it repeatedly from our perspective. Hence, I wish to express a word with my shallow knowledge, but due to insufficient research materials, I will forgo empirical evidence of the actual impact for now and solely consider, from a theoretical standpoint, what kind of impact the unified tariff will indeed have on us Koreans.

First is the impact on general consumers. The existing Chosŏn tariff rates are significantly lower compared to Japanese tariff rates; that is, excluding a very small number of goods, they do not exceed 5 to 10 percent ad valorem. Therefore, if Japanese tariff rates replace these, the burden of tariffs on goods previously imported from various foreign countries will suddenly increase, and it is clear that consumers will suffer greatly. Some might say, "If Japan and Chosŏn become a single customs territory, abolishing the tariff wall between them, and the tariff rates towards foreign countries are increased, although Chosŏn consumers might face an increased burden on goods imported from foreign countries, on the other hand, the burden will be lightened due to the abolition of import taxes on Japanese products, so the consumers' interests will not be harmed by the unified tariff." However, this is observing only one side and can be called truly worthless. Looking broadly at the goods imported into Chosŏn now, the vast majority of goods imported from Japan are needed by the Japanese residing in Chosŏn. Also, the living circumstances of the general Korean population are still vastly different from those of the Japanese, and rather have many similarities with the Chinese. Therefore, the majority of goods imported from China, which occupies the first position among foreign trade partners, are consumed by Koreans. Since the burden of tariffs imposed on necessities is, in principle, passed on to the consumer, the abolition of tariffs between Japan and Chosŏn means reducing the living expenses of resident Japanese, while the increase in tariff rates with foreign countries, especially China, means increasing the living expenses of Koreans. In other words, the unified tariff system cannot but be interpreted as taking a portion of the burden from resident Japanese and adding it to the burden of Koreans. From this perspective, what the proponent says solely points to the interests of the minority Japanese, making it difficult to call it a fair argument.

Second is the impact on foreign traders. Due to the high construction of the tariff wall, goods imported from foreign countries <10> will naturally cease or greatly diminish. Consequently, many who have traditionally engaged in trade with various foreign countries will face unemployment. Some might say, "Among imports from foreign countries, China, Great Britain, and the United States are the largest in that order. Setting aside China, the goods imported from Britain and the US often share the same range of types as goods imported into Japan from these countries. Therefore, due to the unified tariff, Japanese products will replace products from these countries, and it is unlikely that the import of these countries' products will be greatly prevented. Thus, the increase in tariffs on these imports will ultimately be passed on to consumers, and traders will not suffer significant losses." However, while it is true, as the proponent argues, that the increased tax amount due to the rise in tariff rates is somewhat passed on to consumers depending on the ebb and flow of demand for the taxed goods, the presence or absence of competing products, the amount of tax, and the elasticity of supply, at the same time, the importer must also bear a portion of the tax. Also, because Japan and Chosŏn differ in climate, environment, customs, and other circumstances, production and consumption also become distinct special types. Consequently, one can know that there are, in fact, many goods that are produced in large quantities in Japan and exported overseas, but cannot be produced in Chosŏn and are entirely dependent on foreign countries. Under the unified tariff, due to the freedom of entry for Japanese products and the restriction on imports of foreign products, it is clear that while imports from one side (Japan) will surge, imports from the other side (foreign countries) will plummet. Observing the traders, however, traders involved in Japan-Chosŏn trade are almost entirely Japanese, whereas traders involved in cross-border trade with the neighboring country (China), which occupies the first position in foreign trade, are mostly Korean. Therefore, regarding traders as well, it must be said that the unified tariff will enrich Japanese traders while simultaneously delivering a significant blow to Korean traders.

Third is the impact on general producers. The result of abolishing the high tariff wall between countries with different levels of economic progress and improving transportation facilities to ease transport and traffic is to intensify free competition. The result of intense free competition is the realization of the principle of survival of the fittest (優勝劣敗). That is, goods from countries with relatively superior technology, management, and other production conditions will overwhelm the products of relatively inferior countries. However, although the Chosŏn tariff rate has traditionally been a very low revenue tariff, because there were previously no significant manufactured products in Chosŏn, there was no instance of industry being overwhelmed by imports from advanced countries. Even if there were some products, their type and range were vastly different from imports from civilized countries, so they were not competitors. In contrast, Japanese products have many similarities in type and range to Chosŏn products compared to products from other foreign countries. Furthermore, their quality is not as superior and high-priced as goods from other foreign countries, <11> and they are suitable for Korean demand. Therefore, if imports are made free due to the tariff abolition now, there is a great danger of harming the infant Chosŏn industry. Some might say, "If the tariff between Japan and Chosŏn is removed, it is indisputable that Japanese processed goods will enter Chosŏn more easily than today. However, agricultural products, especially rice, exported annually from Chosŏn to Japan are most numerous. Since the burden of taxes and other public levies in Chosŏn is much smaller compared to that in Japan, if the tariff is also abolished, Chosŏn farmers will be in an advantageous position, harming the interests of Japanese farmers. Therefore, the unified tariff has one benefit and one harm for the industries of both places, resulting in no significant overall impact on average." However, although about one million sŏk (석, a unit of volume) of rice are exported from Chosŏn annually, this will supply the demand of the Japanese population, which increases by about 700,000 annually, and I wonder if this will not deprive Japanese farmers of the profit they have traditionally enjoyed. Moreover, in Chosŏn too, this year's budget includes a 30% increase in the land tax and increases or new establishments of other public levies. As the burden of taxes and other public levies becomes similar on the one hand, while local technology such as fertilizers and irrigation remains inferior on the other, how can it be said that Chosŏn is in a superior position regarding production conditions? Even supposing the unified tariff has no particular impact on Chosŏn farmers, there is no denying the concern that it will exert great pressure on industry.

Fourth is the impact on public finance. In Chosŏn's finances, tariff revenue is the most reliable and substantial source of funds among regular revenues, second only to the land tax. Its revenue amount shows a gradually increasing trend following the recent development of trade. Among this, the amount of trade with Japan, due to power relations, shows an ever-expanding tendency compared to the trade amount with foreign countries. That is, in 1909, the year before annexation, the ratio in total trade was Japan 64% and foreign countries 36%, but in 1921, the ratio became Japan 77% and foreign countries 23%. As the trade amount with Japan occupies almost the entirety, the tariff revenue amount has also come to occupy almost the entirety. For instance, in 1912, out of a total tariff revenue of 4.87 million won, the tariff revenue from trade with Japan was 2.97 million won, and in 1920, out of a total tariff revenue of 9.39 million won, the tariff revenue from trade with Japan was about 7 million won. Then, by what means can the 7 million won revenue source lost due to tariff abolition be supplemented? According to recent newspaper reports, since the tax amount on alcohol and textiles, which will continue for the time being, occupies about half of the total import tax amount, the actual deficit amount will be only about 3.5 million won. Some say this will be supplemented from the general account, while others say Chosŏn's expenses will be reduced by that amount. However, at this time when striving for Chosŏn's fiscal independence, there is no reason to increase the supplementary funds from the general account. Also, in the peninsula's landscape where planned projects are backlogged, there is no room to reduce national expenses. Therefore, <12> the replenishment will inevitably lead to increases or new establishments of other taxes. It is unknown which other taxes will increase, but it is certain that the burden will ultimately fall upon the people of Chosŏn. Last year, various income taxes increased, and in this year's budget, due to tax rate hikes, the land tax is expected to increase by about 3.6 million won, and the alcohol tax and sugar consumption tax are each expected to increase by 800,000 won. If the burden of the 7 million won (3.5 million won for the time being) lost tariff revenue is added on top of this, the Koreans, whose productive power is still insufficient, will inevitably face exploitation (誅求). Therefore, it must be said that the unified tariff, from a fiscal perspective as well, cannot escape the resentful voice that it increases the tax burden on Koreans.

As shown above, the unified tariff brings adverse effects to Koreans in various aspects. The current government, placing Chosŏn under the principle of extending mainland Japan (日本內地 延長主義) and advocating for Japan-Korea harmony (日鮮融和), might perhaps claim that even if the unified tariff is implemented, they will set up meticulous interventions (干涉) to avoid noticeable harm to Koreans as much as possible while simultaneously prohibiting undue benefits for Japanese. However, in reality, for the reasons described next, this will be ineffective. In other words, under the unified principle, when the import of foreign goods is cut off by erecting high walls of protective tariffs, the natural tendency will be that, on one hand, Japanese producers, taking advantage of the complete absence of foreign competition, will collude with each other, perhaps forming cartels (「카텔」) or merging into trusts (「튜러스트」), to grasp the Chosŏn market single-handedly and pursue monopolistic exorbitant profits. On the other hand, this will cause general prices to soar, leading to considerable hardship in living for both Japanese and Koreans. This is because, while in free-trade countries the limit on prices mainly lies in production costs, in protectionist countries, the limit on prices mainly lies at the import point of foreign goods. That is, when the Japanese tariff rate applied to Chosŏn raises the import point of foreign goods above the production cost in mainland Japan, Japanese cartels or trusts will be able to strongly raise prices up to this import point and monopolize exorbitant profits. Some might say, "If the level of the tariff rate applied to Chosŏn is too high, the profits of protected production in Japan will certainly increase, but if profits increase, competition also intensifies. Therefore, although external competition might cease, internal competition, that is, competition among Japanese and Koreans themselves, will become even fiercer. How could one or two entrepreneurs come to monopolize the Chosŏn market?" However, this can be called a superficial view. Indeed, if the profits of protected production increase as a result of implementing protective tariffs, competitors for this will increase, but in reality, Koreans, whose capital, technology, management, and other production conditions are still extremely weak, cannot possibly stand in a position to compete with Japanese. Also, Japanese producers, realizing that continuing competition among fellow businesses leads to mutual ruin (共倒), will eventually contemplate monopolizing exorbitant profits by dominating the market. This is why antagonism often ends in cooperation (提携), and competition ends in combination (合同), as the history of American trusts has proven. Thus, Japanese producers, having organized cartels or trusts and monopolized the Chosŏn market, will greedily pursue undue exorbitant profits by arbitrarily raising prices using various pretexts such as production reduction, transportation failures, or other excuses. <13> The fact that the current Government-General and various subordinate government offices are pouring all their efforts into lowering prices but achieving little effect seems to stem from the reasons mentioned above. In short, even if policymakers implement the unified tariff system with impartial intentions, the reality is different, and this system cannot escape the criticism that it sacrifices all consumers in Chosŏn for the sake of enriching a segment of producers in mainland Japan.

Then, even if the unified tariff has such unfair impacts as described above, is there necessarily a need from other aspects to implement this system? Some might say, "Although the unified tariff system entails some losses for Chosŏn, to fully realize the original purpose of the annexation, it is necessary to form a single economic sphere by also making it a single customs territory economically." However, this is an argument that insists political territory and customs territory must necessarily coincide; it must be called the words of someone afflicted with the extensionism principle (延長主義). Surveying the tariff systems of various countries today, sometimes a territory belonging to one country is specially treated as if it were a foreign country solely for tariff purposes, collecting tariffs just like on foreign goods. For example, Austria, until 1891, maintained a tariff line between Trieste (「튜리에스트」) and Fiume (「퓨메」) and the mainland. Germany, before the war, established tariff lines between free ports like Hamburg (「험뻑」) and Bremen (「푸레멘」) and the mainland. Conversely, there have been cases where foreign territory was specially treated as domestic territory solely for tariff purposes, allowing completely free movement of goods between them. Examples include Monaco (「모나코」) (an independent state between Italy and France) in relation to France, Luxemburg (「륙셈뼉」) (an independent state between Germany and France) in relation to Germany, and Liechtenstein (「리히덴스타인」) (an independent state between Switzerland and Austria) in relation Kto Austria – these are all common examples. Thus, even excluding cases of customs unions, there was the instance of Austrian territories Jungholz (「융구홀즈」) and Mittelberg (「미텔뻑」) being treated as German territory solely for tariff purposes. From this perspective, it is clear that the customs line does not necessarily coincide with the national border line, but is demarcated separately according to differing economic circumstances. Thus, despite the customs territory being entirely different from the political territory, and disregarding the special economic circumstances, insisting on limiting the customs line to the national border line is originally the assertion of those afflicted with the extensionism principle. If Chosŏn's tariffs are revised in such a way, from a Korean perspective, it must inevitably be said that there is concern it will be like straightening the horns only to kill the ox (矯角殺牛).

Then, how should the Chosŏn tariff be revised? In my humble opinion, revising it into a revenue tariff system under a Chosŏn-centric principle (朝鮮本位主義) (which, being free trade, does not conflict with a world-centric principle) would be most suitable for Chosŏn's current economic situation. Why? Because Chosŏn's territory is relatively small and underdeveloped (壞地偏小), economic development can only be expected after expanding the scope of competition through free trade. Also, because Chosŏn is still undeveloped (未開), cultural development can only be hoped for after sufficiently importing the civilized goods of advanced nations through an open door policy (門戶開放).

**Summary**

Kim Kyu-ho argues strongly against the proposed unified tariff system between Japan and Korea (Chosŏn). He contends that replacing Korea's low tariffs with Japan's higher rates, while eliminating tariffs between the two, will primarily benefit Japanese residents and businesses in Korea at the expense of the Korean population. He predicts higher living costs for Koreans (due to increased tariffs on goods from China, their main supplier), disadvantages for Korean traders dealing with foreign countries, the stifling of nascent Korean industries by freely imported Japanese goods, and an increased tax burden on Koreans to compensate for lost tariff revenue. Kim refutes arguments about mutual benefits or the necessity of aligning customs territory with political territory, citing European examples and warning against the "extensionism principle." He advocates for maintaining an independent Korean tariff system focused on revenue generation and free trade (a "Chosŏn-centric principle") to foster economic development and cultural progress through competition and access to foreign goods.

This article is historically significant as it provides a contemporary Korean perspective on a specific Japanese colonial economic policy – the tariff unification. It clearly articulates the perceived negative consequences for Koreans across consumer, trade, industrial, and fiscal spheres, highlighting the economic asymmetry and conflicting interests within the colonial framework. Historians would find value in its detailed arguments against the official Japanese narrative (represented by the counter-arguments Kim refutes), its focus on the impact on Korean living standards and nascent industries, its explicit critique of the "extensionism principle," and its proposal of an alternative "Chosŏn-centric" economic policy, reflecting nationalist economic thought during the period. The discussion of trade patterns (reliance on China for Korean necessities vs. Japanese goods for Japanese residents) is also revealing.

關稅改正이 朝鮮人 産業界에 及하는 影響
						金逵浩
元來 我 朝鮮 關稅制度는 30餘年 前 或 40餘年 前에 列國과 締結한 通商條約에 基因하야 定한 協定稅則인 故로 半永久性을 帶하얏더니 1910年 8月 合邦시에 通商諸國에게 發表한 것을 據하건대 今後 10年 間은 朝鮮獨立關稅區域으로 하야 從來 關稅制度에 由케 한다 宣言한 故로 右通商條約의 效力이 1920年 即 再昨年 8月 31日에 當然히 消滅되엇고 從하야 關稅改正의 自由를 得케 되엇도다. 然則 此를 如何히 改正할가 함에 對하야 當時 輿論을 網羅하건대 日人側에서는 多數가 統一關稅主義(日鮮 間에 關稅墻壁을 撤廢하고 朝鮮 內에 日本 關稅制度 「明治 44年부터 施行하는 것」을 移用코자 하는 主義)下에는 多少 改正하기를 主張하얏고, 朝鮮人側에서는 擧皆獨立關稅主義(從來와 如히 日本 關稅區域 內에 不入케하고 朝鮮의 特殊한 經濟事情을 叅酌하야 別로히 關稅線을 定하는 主義)下에서 多少 改正하기를 主張하얏도다. 當時 日本 政府에서는 朝鮮人의 輿論이 如何히 沸騰함을 不顧하고 또한 朝鮮人의 産業이 如何히 被害됨을 不拘하고 統一關稅主義를 採用하되 多少 改正코자 하얏도다. 然하나 日鮮間 關稅撤廢로 因하야 財源 700萬圓(當時는 約 500萬圓)이 缺損되겟는 故로 諸 外國과의 關稅는 大正 9年 8月 勅令 第 306號로써 日本 關稅率을 同 8月 29日부터 此를 朝鮮에 施行할 件을 公布하얏스나 日鮮간 關稅制度는 撤廢치 못하얏도다. 近日의 報道를 據하건대 右撤廢에 關하야 總督府에서는＜9＞日本大藏省과 協議中인데, 移入貨物中 酒와 織物은 當分間 存續하고 其他 諸物에 對하야는 大正 12年 4月 1日부터 關稅를 廢코자하야 調査終了 後 閣議에 上程한 後에 第 46議會의 協贊을 求하리라 云하니 由是觀之컨대 總督府에서는 早晩間 統一關稅를 完全히 實行코자 하는 態度를 示하는 도다. 然則 此로 由하야 經濟上 直接 影響을 受할 我 朝鮮人의 觀察로 再三 硏究할 必要가 有하도다. 於是乎 本人이 淺短知識으로 一言을 發코자 하나 調査材料가 不充分함으로 實際的으로 그 及하는 바 影響의 實証은 姑捨하고 但理論 方面으로 統一關稅가 果然 我 朝鮮人에게 如何한 影響이 及할 가를 애오라지 考察코자 하노라.
第一에는 一般 消費者에게 及하는 影響이니 從來 朝鮮 關稅率은 日本 關稅率에 比하야 甚히 低位에 在하니 即 極히 少數의 貨物을 除하고는 從價五分내지 一割에 不過하도다. 故로 若日本 關稅率로써 此에 代하면 從來 諸 外國으로부터 輸入하던 貨物은 忽然히 關稅의 負擔이 增加하야 消費者에게 多大한 害가 及할 것은 明白하도다. 或은 曰 「若日鮮間을 一關稅區域으로 하야 其 間에 關稅墻壁을 撤廢하고 對外國 關稅率을 增加함에 在하야 朝鮮內 消費者가 外國에서 輸入하는 貨物에 對하야는 或 負擔의 增加가 有할지나 他方에서 日本 産物의 移入稅가 撤廢됨에 依하야 그 負擔을 輕減하는 故로 消費者의 利益은 統一關稅로 因하야 害될 것이 無하리라고」 云하나 然하나 此는 一面만 觀察함이니 實로 無價値하다 云할지라. 今에 朝鮮에 輸移入하는 貨物을 槪觀하건대 日本으로부터 移入하는 貨物의 多大數는 朝鮮에 移住한 日本人이 需要하는 배요 又 一般 朝鮮人의 生活事情이 아즉까지도 日本人과는 大異하고 차라리 中國人과 類似한 點이 多한 故로 外國貿易國中에 第 1位를 占領한 中國으로부터 輸入하는 貨物의 多部分은 朝鮮人이 消費하는 배니 必要品에 課하는 關稅의 負擔은 消費者에게 轉嫁됨이 原則인 故로 日鮮間의 關稅撤廢는 移住 日本人의 生活費를 輕減함이요 外國 特히 中國과의 關稅率의 引上은 朝鮮人의 生活費를 增加함이라 云할지라. 換言하건대 統一關稅制度는 移住 日本人의 負擔의 一部를 割出하야써 此를 朝鮮人의 負擔에 添加함이라고 解釋치 아니치 못할지니라. 由此觀之컨대 論者의 云하는 바는 專혀 少數되는 日本人의 利益만 指함이니 正當한 言論이라 云키 難하도다.
第2에는 外國貿易業者에게 及하는 影響이니 外國으로부터 輸入하는 貨物은 關稅의 墻壁을 高築함으로 因하야＜10＞ 自然의 勢로 杜絶 或 大滅하게 될지니 從하야 從來로 諸 外國貿易으로 業하던 者는 失業할 境遇에 處할 者 多할지니라. 或은 曰 「外國에서 輸入하는 中, 英, 米, 3國이 順位로 最多하니 中國은 姑捨하고 英美 兩國에서 輸入하는 貨物은 時等國에서 日本에 輸入하는 貨物과 種類의 範圍가 同一한 者 不少함으로써 統一關稅의 原因으로 日本産物이 即 時此等國의 産物에 代하야 此等國産物의 輸入을 防止할 者 不多하겟는 故로 是等 輸入品의 關稅增加는 結局 消費者에게 轉嫁할지오 貿易業者에게는 크게 損될 것이 無하리라.」고 云하는 도다. 然하나 關稅率의 昻登으로 因하야 增加되는 稅額은 課稅貨物에 對한 需要의 消長 競爭品의 有無 稅額의 多寡 及供給의 彈力 如何에 依하야 多少 消費者에게 轉嫁된다 함은 論者와 如하거니와 同時에 輸入業者도 그 稅金의 幾分을 負擔치 아니치 못할지로다. 又 日本과 朝鮮과는 氣候, 風土, 習慣, 其他 事情이 相異함에 從하야 生産과 消費도 共히 各各 特種別物이 됨으로써 日本에서는 多量으로 生産하야 海外에 輸出하는 者로대 朝鮮에서는 生産키 不能하야 全혀 外國에 依하는 貨物이 事實上 多함을 知할지니라. 統一關稅는 日本産의 移入自由됨과 外國産의 輸入制限됨으로 因하야 一方의 移入이 激增하는 同時에 他方의 輸入이 激減할 것은 明白하도다. 그런데 貿易業者를 觀察하건대 日鮮間 貿易業者는 殆히 全部가 日本이이오 外國貿易中 第 1位를 占領한 連陸國境貿易業者는 多部分 朝鮮人이라. 故로 貿易業者에 任하야서도 統一關稅로 因하야 日人貿易業者의 利益을 厚케하는 同時에 鮮人貿易業者에게 多大한 打擊을 給할지라고 謂치 아니치 못할지니라.
第3에는 一般 生業者에게 及하는 影響이니 經濟進步의 程度가 不同한 國間에서 關稅의 高壁을 撤廢하며 交通機關을 改良하야 運輸交通을 容易하게 함에서 生하는 結果는 自有競爭을 激甚하게 할지오. 自由競爭이 甚한 結果는 優勝劣敗의 公理를 實現할지라. 即 技術, 經營 其他 生産條件이 比較的 優良한 國의 物品이 比較的 劣弱한 國의 産을 壓倒할 지니라. 然하나 從來 朝鮮關稅率은 極低한 歲入關稅이로대 從前까지 朝鮮에는 生産製品이 別無함으로 先進國의 輸入品에게 産業壓倒된 것이 無하얏고 設或 若干 製品이 有하다 할지라도 文明國의 輸入品과 그 種類範圍가 大異한 故로 競爭의 敵이 되지 아니하얏도다. 是와 反하야 日本産物은 그 種類範圍가 諸外産物에 比하야는 朝鮮産物과 類似한 點이 多하며 兼하야 品質이 諸 外國의 物品과 如히 優良價高치 아니하고＜11＞ 朝鮮人 需要에 適合한 故로 今에 關稅撤廢로 因하야 移入을 自由롭게 하면 幼稚한 朝鮮産業에게 妨害가 及할 危險이 多할지니라. 或은 曰 「日鮮間 關稅를 撤去하면 日本加工品이 朝鮮에 移入함이 今日보다 容易하게 될 것은 誤論이 無하나 朝鮮에서 每年 日本에 移出하는 農産物 特히 米穀이 最多하니 朝鮮의 租稅 其他 公課의 負擔이 日本의 그것에 比하야 甚少한 中에 關稅까지 撤廢하면 朝鮮 農業者가 有利한 地位에 在함으로 日本 農業者의 利益을 害할지니라. 故로 統一關稅는 兩地 産業上 各其 一利一害가 有하야 平均 多大한 影響이 無하리라」云하는도다. 然하나 朝鮮에서 每年 移出하는 米穀이 約 百萬石이 되나 此는 日本 人口 每年 約 70萬式 增加하는 者의 需要로 供給이 될지오 此로 因하야 日本 農業者의 從來로 受하던 利를 奪함은 아닐가 하노라. 게다가 朝鮮에도 今年도 豫算에 地租 3割 其他 公課가 增加 或 新設하얏나니 如斯히 一方으로 租稅 其他 公課의 負擔은 差異가 無하게 되는 同時에 地方으로 肥料水利 等 技術이 劣等에 在하나니 어찌 生産條件이 優勝한 地位에 處하다 하리오. 假令 統一關稅가 朝鮮 農業者에게는 影響이 別無하다 할지라도 工業에는 多大한 壓迫을 加할 念慮가 不無할지니라.
第四에는 財政上에 及하는 影響이니 朝鮮 財政上 關稅收入이 經常歲入중 地稅를 除하고는 最確實하고도 多大한 財源이니 그 收入額數는 近年 貿易發展함을 隨하야 漸次 增加의 超勢를 示하는 도다. 就中 對日貿易額은 勢力上 關係로 對外國 貿易額에 比하야 愈愈 擴大하는 傾向이 有하도다. 即 合倂 前 年인 1909年에는 貿易總額中 日本이 64 諸 外國이 36의 割合이러니 1921年에는 日本 77 諸外國 23의 割合이 되는도다. 如斯히 對日貿易額이 殆이 全部를 占領함에 從하야 關稅收入額도 殆히 全部를 占領함에 至하얏도다. 即 1912年에는 關稅總額 487萬圓 中 對日關稅額이 297萬圓이러니 1920年에는 關稅總額 939萬圓中 對日關稅額이 約 700萬圓이 되는도다. 然則 關稅撤廢로 因하야 缺損될 700萬圓의 財源을 如何한 手段으로 그 補充함을 得할가. 近日 新聞上 보도를 據하건대 當分間 存續할 酒及 織物의 稅額이 總移入稅額의 約 半分을 占領한 故로 實上 缺損額이 約 350萬圓에 不過할지니 或은 此를 一般 會計에서 補充하리라 云하며 或은 朝鮮의 經費를 그 額數만치 節約한다 云하는 도다. 然하나 朝鮮의 財政獨立을 圖하는 此 時期에 際하야 一般 會計의 補充金을 增加할 理가 無할지오. 又 施設할 事業이 積滯한 半島江山에서 國家經費를 縮小할 餘地도 無할지니 然則 ＜12＞그 塡補는 不得不 他租稅의 增加 或 新設함에 至할지니라. 他租稅 中 何者가 增加할는지 未知하거니와 結局 朝鮮人民에게 歸着할 것은 確然하도다. 昨年에 諸般所得稅가 增加하얏고 今年度 豫算에도 稅率印象으로 因하야 地稅 約 360萬圓 酒稅 砂糖消費稅가 各 80萬圓式 增加할 豫定이 有하도다. 게다가 關稅의 缺損된 財源 700萬圓(當分間 350萬圓)의 負擔을 增加하면 生産力이 尙今까지 不贍한 朝鮮人에게 誅求됨을 不免할지니라. 故로 統一關稅는 財政上으로도 朝鮮人에게 擔稅를 增加한다는 怨聲을 免키 難하리라 謂치 아니치 못할지니라.
以上과 如히 統一關稅는 朝鮮人에게 各 方面으로 惡影響이 及하는 도다. 朝鮮은 日本內地 延長主義하에 置하고 日鮮融和를 標榜하는 現政府에서는 想必 統一關稅를 施할지라도 可及的 朝鮮人에게 顯著한 害를 避하는 同時에 日人에게 不當한 利를 禁하도록 周密한 干涉을 設한다 할지도 모르나 事實은 次述의 理由로 그 效가 無할지니라. 換言하건대 統一主義下에서 保護關稅의 墻壁을 高築하야 外國品의 輸入이 杜絶할 時에는 自然의 勢로 一方에는 日本生産者 等은 外國品의 競爭이 皆無함을 奇貨로 하야 互相氣脉을 通하야 或은 「카텔」(Kartell)로 聯合하며 或은 「튜러스트」(Turst)로 合同하야 朝鮮市場을 一手에 掌握하야써 獨占의 暴利를 貪함에 至할지오 他方에는 此로 由하야 一般 物價가 騰貴하야 日鮮人 共히 生活困難을 感케 하는 事 不少할지니라. 此는 盖 自由貿易國에서는 物價의 制限이 主로 生産費에 在하나 保護貿易國에서는 物價의 制限이 主로 外國品 輸入點에 在한 所以니라. 卽 朝鮮에 移用하는 日本關稅率이 日本內地의 生産費 以上에 外國品 輸入點을 高하는 時에는 日本의 「카텔」 或 「튜러스트는 此 輸入点까지 强히 物價를 引上하야 獨占의 暴利를 壟斷함을 得함에 至할지니라. 或은 曰 「朝鮮에 施하는 關稅率의 程度가 過高하면 日本의 被保護生産의 利益이 增加함은 勿論이나 利益이 增加하면 競爭도 亦 激烈하는 故로 外部의 競爭은 杜絶할지라도 內部의 競爭 即 日鮮人 互相間의 競爭은 一層 猛烈할지니 어찌 一二의 企業者가 朝鮮 市場을 獨占함에 至하리오」 云하는도다. 然하나 此는 皮相的 見解라 謂할지니라. 果然 保護關稅를 施한 結果 被保護生産의 利益이 增進하면 此에 對한 競爭者가 增加하리라 云하나 事實上 朝鮮人은 資本, 技術, 經營 其他 生産條件이 아즉도 甚히 劣弱함으로써 到底히 日人과 競爭할 地位에 立함을 不得할지라. 又 日本生産者 等은 同業者가 競爭을 繼續하면 共倒에 陷할 것을 悟하고 드듸어 市場獨占의 暴利를 壟斷할 事를 思考함에 至할지니라. 此는 反目의 極은 提携에 終하고 競爭의 末은 合同에 終하는 所以니 일즉히 米國의 「튜러스트」 渤史가 證明하는 배니라. 如斯히 日本生産者 等은 「카텔」 或은 「튜러스트」를 組織하야 朝鮮 市場을 獨占한 以上에는 生産의 減少라던가 運輸의 故障이라던가 기타 種種의 口實을 設하야 任意로 價格을 引上하야써 不當의 暴利를 貪할지니라.＜13＞ 現今 總督府 以下 各 官廳에서 物價引下에 全力을 注하나 그 效가 少無함은 以上 原因에 由함인가 하노라. 要컨대 爲政者는 비록 公平意思로 統一關稅制度를 施한다 할지나 事實은 不然하야 反히 此 制度가 日本內地의 一部 生産者의 懷中을 肥케하기 爲하야 朝鮮의 全部 消費者를 犧牲에 供함이라는 非難을 免치 못할지니라.
然則 統一關稅는 以上과 如히 不公平한 影響이 及할지라도 他方面에 반듯이 此 制度를 施行할 必要가 有할가. 或은 曰 「統一關稅制度가 朝鮮에는 多少 損害가 有하나 合倂한 本旨를 完全히 하랴면 經濟上으로도 또한 一關稅區域으로 하야써 一經濟圈을 形成치 아니치 못할지라.」 云하는도다. 然하나 此는 政治區域과 關稅區域과를 반듯이 一致됨을 要하는 言이니 卽 延長主義에 病든 者의 言이라 謂치 아니치 못할지니라. 今에 各國 關稅制度를 通覺컨대 或 時에는 一國의 領土로대 關稅制度上에서만 特히 外國同樣으로 看做하야 外國品과 同一히 關稅를 徵收하는 者가 有한지라. 例컨대, 墺太利에서는 1891年까지 「튜리에스트」(Trest) 及 「퓨메」(Fiume)와 內地 間에 又 獨逸에서는 戰前까지 「험뻑」 及 「푸레멘」 等의 自由港과 內地 間에 關稅線을 設하얏스며 此와 反對로 外國領土로대 關稅制度上에서만 特히 內國同樣 으로 看做하야 其 間에 貨物出入을 全然히 自有롭게한 事가 有하얏나니 例컨대 「모나코」(Monaco)(伊佛間 獨立國)의 佛蘭西에 對함과 「륙셈뼉」(Luxemburg)(獨佛間 獨立國)의 獨逸에 對함과 「리히덴스타인」(Lichtenstein)(瑞墺間 獨立國)의 墺太利에 對함이 皆 其 通例니라. 如斯히 關稅同盟의 境遇를 除할지라도 墺領 「융구홀즈」(Iungholz) 及 「미텔뻑」(Mittelburg)이 關稅制度上에서만 獨逸領으로 取扱하는 事가 有하도다. 由是觀之컨대 關稅線은 반듯이 國境線과 一致되는 事 아니오 經濟事情이 相異함에 從하야 別로이 劃定아는 것을 明確히 知할지니라. 如斯히 關稅區域이 政治區域과 全異함을 불구하고 又 經濟事情이 特殊함을 不顧하고 기어히 關稅線을 國境線에 限하고자 함은 元來 延長主義에 病든 者의 主張이나 如斯히 朝鮮 關稅를 改正하면 朝鮮人의 觀察로는 結局 矯角殺牛의 念慮가 된다 謂치 아니치 못할지니라.
然則 朝鮮關稅를 如何히 改正함이 可할가? 愚見에는 朝鮮本位主義(自由貿易인 故로 世界本位主義와 抵觸되지 아니함)하에서 歲入關稅制度로 改正함이 今日 朝鮮經濟事情에 最適할가 하노라. 何者오하면 盖 朝鮮은 壞地偏小함으로 通商自由로 因하야 競爭의 範圍를 擴大한 然後에야 經濟의 發達을 可期할지오. 又 朝鮮은 아즉도 未開함으로 門戶開放으로 由하야 先進國의 文明品을 充分히 輸入한 後에야 文化開拓을 可望하겟는 所以니라.
