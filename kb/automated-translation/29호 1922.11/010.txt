開闢社 (Gaebyeoksa)

**Summary**

This is a brief announcement from Gaebyeoksa, the publisher of the magazine *Gaebyeok*, informing readers that the company is establishing a "Company Friend" (社友) system, likely a form of membership or associates program, based on its internal regulations. Interested parties are told that details are available separately and that inquiries should be directed to the General Affairs Department at their office in Gyeongun-dong, Gyeongseong (colonial Seoul). From a historical perspective, this announcement shows a prominent cultural organization during the Japanese colonial period attempting to formalize and strengthen its relationship with its audience or supporters. This could reflect a strategy to build a loyal base, potentially for financial support or broader dissemination of its ideas, within the constraints of colonial rule. The use of the term "동무" (comrade) is also characteristic of the nationalist or progressive discourse of the time.
