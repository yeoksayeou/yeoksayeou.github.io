Author: 車相瓚
Article Type: 시 (Poem)

Autumn grasses desolate, a seven-foot grave,
All human affairs are also floating clouds.
West wind, setting sun, the road toward Usan,
The cuckoo's cries, sound after sound, unbearable to hear.

Above Tujŏnjŏng Pavilion, the evening sun lingers long,
Once the Master departed, what can be done about the sorrow?
The ancient quiver's divine bow shoots not in autumn,
Mountain birds and wild deer pass by on their own.

Before Mangwŏlbong Peak, the trees show autumn's touch,
Below Ponghwanggak Pavilion, the water flows emptily.
Village farmers know not the Master's sorrow,
At sunset, they come to the grassy plain to herd cows.

The lacquer lamp, dark and dim, grows cold into ash,
Wind and rain on the empty mountain, the stone beasts mourn.
Three hundred cherry trees in the valley,
From now on, year after year, for whom will they bloom?

The Master's great righteousness resembles Kongming,
Running servants and street children all know his name.
His heroic spirit, for a thousand years, surely will not die,
It should also be smiling in the blessed city (佳城).<48>

**Summary**

This Hanja poem by Ch'a Sangch'an is an elegy written after visiting the grave of Son Pyŏnghŭi (art name Ŭiam), the revered leader of Cheondogyo and a central figure in the March 1st Movement, who died in May 1922. The poet contrasts the desolation and quiet neglect of the grave site in Uidong with the enduring legacy and widespread recognition of Son Pyŏnghŭi, comparing his righteousness to that of the famed strategist Kongming (Zhuge Liang). The poem expresses deep sorrow and loss, questioning the future (symbolized by the cherry blossoms) without the leader. For historians, the poem offers insight into the immediate aftermath of Son Pyŏnghŭi's death, reflecting the profound sense of loss among Koreans and the veneration of nationalist figures even under Japanese colonial rule. The poem's melancholic tone and subtle praise serve as a veiled expression of national sentiment and mourning during a period of suppressed political activity.

漢詩, 秋日往牛耳洞拜 孫義庵先生墓
						車相瓚
秋艸荒凉七尺墳, 人間萬事亦浮雲. 西風落日牛山路, 杜宇聲聲不忍聞.
杜鵑亭上夕陽多, 一去先生恨奈何. 古匣神弓秋不射, 山禽野鹿自相過.
望月峰前樹欲秋, 鳳凰閣下水空流, 村農不識先生恨, 落日艸原來牧牛.
漆燈暗暗冷成灰, 風雨空山石獸哀. 洞裏櫻花三百樹, 從今歲歲爲誰開.
先生大義似孔明, 走卒街童盡識名. 壯魄千年當不死, 也應含笑在佳城.＜48＞
