The World and Korea during September and October
						One Reporter

Foreword

We hope that every single one of our compatriots lives not in vast theories or abstract concepts, but in the clearest and most rigorous facts. As a premise for this, we must first constantly observe and judge the current situations and trends arising on the surface of the various nations and societies surrounding us, and we hope that all intentions and actions emerging from that clear consciousness will be most thorough and poignant. In this sense, we have long intended to establish this column to urge the attention of wise readers. However, even writing it truthfully involved numerous inconveniences with this magazine until recently, and we barely managed to fulfill that responsibility amidst great difficulty. Now that those inconveniences have disappeared, we intend to report this even more faithfully, thereby serving as an aid for our brethren to focus on the transformations of the real society and create a most truthful, organic new life. Accordingly, we hope our humble intention does not vanish like smoke.

August 26: In Tokyo, the Niigata Prefecture Laborer Problem Investigation Committee, organized by students studying abroad, heard the report of field investigator Mr. Kim Yaksu. Afterward, they resolved to (1) arouse public opinion, (2) seek the cancellation of the labor contract with Ōkura-gumi, (3) control the recruitment of laborers within Korea through unjust means, etc. In T'alch'ŏlli, Kuyŏnmyŏn, Pongsŏng-gun, Kim Chint'ae and one other person carried firearms and collected military funds.<95>

August 28: At the International Jurists' Conference held in Buenos Aires with representatives from 10 countries, Britain's proposal regarding the establishment of a permanent international court to handle criminal offenders worldwide was approved. That morning, the funeral of Mr. Collins was held in Dublin, Ireland, with attendees reaching 400,000.

August 29: This day marked 12 years since the Japan-Korea Treaty was concluded. About 20 Korean political prisoners in Kyŏngsŏng Prison commemorated this day by refusing breakfast. The Kyŏngsŏng Chamber of Commerce hosted a Price Control Conference at the Kyŏngsŏng Public Hall. Several famous members of the Russian Communist Party, angered by the expulsion of 200 intellectuals carried out on the 21st, resigned from the Communist Party.

August 30: A Yŏnggwang Citizens' Rally was held at Sajŏng Pavilion within Yŏnggwang-ŭp. This was due to fury over the incident where a Japanese person named Hori, residing in Non'anri, Yŏmsanmyŏn, same county, unreasonably beat Cho Hwach'un at the farm he managed.

August 31: The Ch'ŏndogyo Local Diocese Representatives' Meeting, which opened on the 15th, concluded its business, including the passage of the church constitution and regulations and budget verification, amidst some turbulence. It elected nine leaders (宗理師) according to the new system: Ch'oe Rin, Kwŏn Tongjin, Na Yonghwan, O Yŏngch'ang, Kwŏn Pyŏngdŏk, Na Inhyŏp, Pak Chunsŭng, and Yi Insuk, and closed the meeting that day. As it was the 105th day after the death of the third Ch'ŏndogyo leader, Son Pyŏnghŭi, followers held 105-day prayer ceremonies in various places and ended their mourning period. In Paris, the Allied Reparations Committee rejected, by a vote of two to one, the British committee member's proposal for an unconditional postponement of German reparation payments until the end of December this year. The Wŏnsan Aeuhoe (Friendship Association, with intimacy as its primary goal), initiated by Messrs. Kim Pyŏngnyun, Nam Sangbin, Kim Sang'ik, and others from Wŏnsan Youth, was established.

September 1: The Korean National Convention in Shanghai, scheduled to open today, was postponed until early October due to participant-related issues. Japan's Kokumintō (國民黨), one of the three major political parties (Seiyūkai, Kenseikai, Kokumintō), dissolved itself under the banner of propagating its traditional principles and aspirations to the entire nation and rising together with the whole populace. The first Social Work Training Session, hosted by the Government-General authorities, opened at the Hyangsang Hoegwan in Ch'ŏnyŏndong. The Korean headquarters of the Japan Kokusuikai (國粹會 - National Essence Society) was established, electing Ono Matashirō and 20 other committee members, fervently calling for the protection of the Imperial Household. The French cabinet resolved to advocate for a conference of all Allied nations regarding Allied war debts and reparations issues.<96> The Reparations Committee, which had previously rejected the British proposal for unconditional payment deferral, adopted the Belgian plan instead. Germany was to pay this year's reparations, for which Belgium had priority rights, using treasury bonds. The collateral issue was to be decided between Germany and Belgium, ultimately postponing the reparation payments until the end of this year. The Niigata Prefecture Korean Massacre Incident Investigation Committee had earlier dispatched Kim Saguk and Na Kyŏngsŏk to the scene to investigate the truth. As Mr. Kim Saguk returned first, the first investigation report lecture meeting was held today inside the Ch'ŏndogyo Hall. A large crowd of 1,500 people gathered, showing unprecedented enthusiasm. The only girls' school in Kuyu-myŏn, Cheju Island, was newly established and opened.

September 2: A strong earthquake occurred in Taipei, Taiwan, damaging the seismograph.

September 3: Heavy rain fell again in western Korea, causing the flooding of 300 houses in P'yŏngyang and considerable damage in the Pongsŏng and Chaeryŏng areas. The first issue of the weekly magazine "Tongmyŏng" (東明), advocating for the Korean people's national self-help and unity, was published.

September 4: The Third Assembly of the League of Nations opened in Geneva. The efforts of petitioning committees from small European states like Albania and Vilna notably attracted attention. Key agenda items for this session included the reduction of land armaments of various countries, whether Germany would join the League, the relief of Austria, and whether the Washington Treaty would apply to League member states. Initiated by prominent citizens of Kyŏngsŏng, the Hwanghae Province Flood Relief Society was established. The first meeting between the representatives of both countries for the Changchun Japan-Russia Conference took place at the Japanese Consulate in Changchun. The Chinju Labor Mutual Aid Society (晉州勞働共濟會), which had been studying the local tenant farming issue, held a Tenant Laborers' Convention today at the local Youth Hall. Representatives from each *myŏn* (township) attended and elected 20 executive committee members.

September 5: The second Local Improvement Training Session, hosted by the Government-General, opened within the Legislative Research Association for a scheduled two-week period. The Japan-Russia Conference formally opened inside the Japanese Consulate in Changchun. Japan sent commissioners Matsudaira and Matsushima, while Russia sent Joffe and Yamson. Disagreement arose immediately over the scope of the conference. Russia wanted to fundamentally resolve all issues between Japan and Russia, while Japan wanted to discuss only the economic issues in Siberia related to the current troop withdrawal. The debate was fierce. A large public speech meeting for the defense of civil rights regarding the Kohŭng County shooting incident was held inside the Central Youth Hall. After passionate speeches by Messrs. Pak Sŭngbin, Yi Chongnin, Kim Ch'ŏlsu, and Ch'oe Wŏnsun, a five-point inquiry to the authorities was approved, and Pak Sŭngbin, Chang Tŏksu, and Sŏl T'aehŭi were appointed as negotiation committee members.<97> In Chŏlla Namdo, Kim Chun'gu, a policeman at the Yŏng'amdo P'o police substation, severely beat the three members of the Ch'oe Yŏngsuk family (father and sons), causing them to vomit blood. The Kaesŏng Juvenile Prison, under construction since this spring, was completed and began operations.

September 6: The Changchun Conference was adjourned. The reason was the aforementioned disagreement between the representatives of the two countries regarding the scope of the conference. Mr. Marcel Sembat, a leader of the French Socialist Party who had led the unified party after the split with the Communist Party and was a heavyweight in the political world, died suddenly of a cerebral hemorrhage. His wife, unable to bear the grief, also committed suicide with a pistol. This is said to be a considerable loss for French politics. Messrs. Sŏl T'aehŭi and Chang Tŏksu, carrying the resolution from the Human Rights Protection Mass Meeting related to the Kohŭng incident, visited Governor-General Saitō, Administrative Superintendent Ariyoshi, and Police Affairs Bureau Director Maruyama at the Government-General, inquiring about the authorities' view on the Kohŭng incident and their future policy regarding it.

September 7: That night, a speech meeting by Kyŏngsŏng notables regarding flood relief for Hwanghae Province was held inside the Central Youth Hall. Brazil held its independence commemoration festival. That night, in Oenam, Sakchu-gun, P'yŏngan Pukto, 30 members of the Independence Corps attacked and set fire to the local police substation, then attacked the Taegwan Post Office, taking goods and money worth 2,000 Won.

September 8: As the head of the Kyŏngsŏng Chamber of Commerce, Minobe Shunkichi, resigned, Vice-Head Fujimoto Tōjirō was elected as the new head. Shiki Shintarō was elected as the Japanese-side Vice-Head, replacing Mr. Fujimoto. At the regular meeting of the Government-General's bureau chiefs, a 14-point countermeasure was approved as a policy to lower prices. Hungary applied for membership in the League of Nations. The Greek cabinet resigned en masse. The US railroad strike was largely resolved. In Taegu, Shin Ch'ŏlsu, a speaker at an oratorical contest hosted by the Kyŏngnam Christian Youth Association, was detained for a week on the grounds that there were seditious points in his speech.

September 9: Early in the morning, on the banks of the Taedong River in Hadanri, Kopyŏngmyŏn, Taedong-gun, P'yŏngan Namdo, the suicide squad of the T'aegŭkdan (大極團) clashed with the P'yŏngyang police force, resulting in the death of one member, Kim Manyŏng. The Turkish National Party army captured Smyrna, achieving a major victory for the Turkish forces. Greece requested an armistice through the Allied Powers.

September 10: A new Anglo-Russian agreement was concluded between Mr. Urquhart, representative of the British company side in Russia, and Mr. Krassin, representative of the workers and peasants. According to this agreement, the company leased Russian state property located in the Ural Mountains region and Western Siberia, originally owned or leased by the same company, for 99 years. Furthermore, the company obtained the right to determine the conditions<98> for hiring the necessary laborers for the leased land itself, under the usual conditions of British labor unions. The adjourned Changchun Conference reopened.

September 11: Over 200 Korean representatives in Shanghai organized the Federation of Korean Compatriots (韓國同胞聯合會) and gave speeches filled with grief and indignation regarding the independence of the motherland. At midnight that night, in Samhŭngmyŏn, Sŏngch'ŏn, 20 members of the Independence Corps attacked the local police substation and *myŏn* office, killing one policeman. The French representative submitted the French army's military expense table to the League of Nations; the total number of troops was 690,000. The Kyŏngsŏng Western Clothing Merchants' Association decided to reduce prices by about 20 percent. Shirakami Yūkichi, the Kyŏnggi Province Police Chief, was transferred to Japan, and Umano Seiichi was appointed as his replacement. It was announced that former French Prime Minister Clemenceau would visit the United States around November 1st for a speaking tour.

September 12: At the London Observatory, the theory of "Continental Drift, Polar Wandering," newly discovered by the German scholar Professor Wegener, was discussed. According to this theory, continents are slowly moving from pole to pole and from east to west. This can be recognized by the shortening of latitudes, and it is said that this fully explains the reasons for climate change, which could not be explained until today. The Japanese cabinet sent telegraphic instructions to representative Matsudaira stating that (1) it is acceptable to expand the scope of the Changchun Conference to cover all Russian issues, but the Far Eastern Republic issue should first be discussed and decided based on the Dairen proposal, in order, before moving to consultations with the worker-peasant state (Soviet Russia), and (2) it is acceptable to review the Dairen Conference agreement proposal article by article again. The new Berenbrouck cabinet was formed in the Netherlands. In Munyangri, P'yoŏmyŏn, Posŏng-gun, Chŏlla Namdo, a certain Mr. Im beat and knocked out the teeth of Chŏn Pyŏng'uk, a teacher at the village school. The reason was the strange fact that the teacher had cut the hair of the thirty-odd students at the school.

September 13: The permit for the construction of the new Namdaemun Market, requested by the Korean Agricultural Company (朝鮮農業會社), was granted. This market, having suffered two fires and being in a shabby state, is planned to have 139 shops and a 170-*pyeong* vegetable market built on a 1,070-*pyeong* site. The Changchun Conference reopened. Russia, as before, insisted on reaching an agreement through both Chita and the worker-peasant government. The Japanese side proposed a compromise asking how about discussing only the Far Eastern Republic issue with both Russia and Chita, and the continuation of the conference was decided. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs readily agreed to Sino-Russian negotiations. The Japanese army dispatched to Northern Manchuria began its withdrawal. Henceforth, not a single Japanese soldier will be seen in Northern Manchuria. Forty US railroad companies announced the resolution of the employee strike. However, the condition was that the wages<99> would remain the same as before the strike. The US Senate passed the China Trade Act, which had already passed the House. This exempts Americans doing business in China from taxation. The P'yŏngyang Chamber of Commerce held an extraordinary council meeting within its building. The mass resignation of the council members was approved, thus bringing a passive resolution to the long-standing conflict and dispute between the Korean council members' side and the Japanese council members' side. The long-standing maneuvering of Japanese council member Furusho also came to nothing.

September 14: The Tang Shaoyi cabinet in China submitted its resignation. In Taehŭngni, Ipsamni, Chŏngŭp, Chŏlla Namdo, the mother of T'aeŭlgyo leader Ch'a Kyŏngsŏk (age 43 this year), Madam Pak, who had died last year and been temporarily buried, was given a formal funeral. Tens of thousands of followers gathered (it is said food tickets alone numbered 450,000), and funeral expenses exceeded 100,000 Won, creating an unbelievably strange spectacle. Almost all the attendees were farmers with uncut hair, and they regarded Madam Pak as the mother of the nation (國母), which led to such a grand event. Students in the 5th and 6th grades of the Yŏng'am Public Normal School staged a collective class boycott, citing 11 grievances, including: (1) the principal opposes the local youth, (2) Korean language songs and Korean history are not taught, (3) only Japanese female teachers are assigned to the girls' classes, (4) explanations during instruction are difficult to understand, etc. A suspected case of cholera occurred in Sinhŭngdong, Yongch'ŏnmyŏn, P'yŏngan Pukto.

September 15: The Government-General permitted the three magazines Chosŏn chi Kwang (朝鮮之光), Sinch'ŏnji (新天地), and Sinsaenghwal (新生活), which had pending applications, under the Newspaper Law. At the same time, it permitted the change in content for Kaebyŏk (開闢) magazine. Furthermore, there were rumors of the abolition of the censorship system (檢閣制) and the travel permit requirement for travel between Japan and China, but these have not yet been realized as law. The 5th Joint Meeting of Korean Chambers of Commerce opened within the Kyŏngsŏng Chamber of Commerce, resolving to request the authorities to realize the Kunsan port construction, establish a special railway freight rate system for Korean-produced fresh fruit, and establish a complete fishing port (漁港) in Pusan harbor. Britain returned Weihaiwei to China. Mustafa Kemal Pasha, the giant among the Turkish military, demanded the unconditional return of Asia Minor, Constantinople, and Thrace. This challenging demand shocked all of Europe. The Japanese government instructed local governors to allow female teachers 6 weeks of rest after childbirth and 2 weeks before childbirth.

September 16: The County Magistrates' Training Session, held at the Government-General Administrative Training Institute, concluded. The Joint Meeting of Chambers of Commerce, which opened yesterday, decided to request the authorities to devise protective and promotional measures for Korean manufacturing industries following the abolition of import tariffs, along with several other items. The meeting of the Niigata Prefecture Korean Massacre Incident Investigation Committee, held at the Tokyo Korean Christian Youth Association, was disbanded shortly after opening by order of the local Metropolitan Police Department.<100> Mr. Sŏ Chŏng'u was arrested. Due to hardship caused by this year's flood damage, over 60 farmers from Tongdunni, Sŏjongmyŏn, Pongsŏn-gun, Hwanghae Province, rushed to the Pongsŏn County Office, crying out (呌嘆) for immediate relief. The Japanese government established an Education Council (敎育評議會) aimed at fundamentally reforming the education system, appointing Minister of Education Ueda Eikichi as chairman and appointing 8 other committee members. The Japanese Diplomatic Investigation Committee, established during the Terauchi cabinet era, was abolished (official gazette announcement on the 18th). The new tariff bill drafted by the US government passed the House; it is significantly higher than the currently effective tariff rates established in 1913. The Wŏnsan Fishery Company (run by Japanese) was established.

September 17: From this day for three days, the joint meeting of American missionaries from various denominations such as Presbyterian and Methodist residing in Korea was held at the Bible Institute in Sŏdaemunchŏng, Kyŏngsŏng. Reports on missionary status and discussions on future missionary policy were the main agenda items, with about 60 attendees. The first Korean Bar Examination was held. Those who passed the preliminary examination on this day were Yi Chongsŏng and 13 other Koreans, and 31 Japanese.

September 18: The second public trial (公判) for the youth Kim Iksang, who threw a bomb at the Government-General and attempted to assassinate General Tanaka in Shanghai, was held at the Nagasaki District Court. The prosecutor sought the death penalty. Japan's Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, Matsukata Masayoshi, resigned, and Hirata Tōsuke replaced him. Mr. Matsukata was further promoted to Duke and joined the ranks of the elder statesmen (Genrō). Since the end of summer this year, cases of "yŏnbyŏng" (fever illness, possibly typhoid or dysentery) have continued to appear in P'yŏngyang, with deaths particularly high among the Japanese population. As of this day, 159 patients were counted. The Changchun Conference, which had been adjourned for the 16th and 17th at the request of the Russian representative, reopened. However, while the Russian representative generally agreed in principle with Japan's compromise proposal to treat both Russia and Chita (i.e., all of Russia) as negotiating partners this time, but limit the scope of application to the Far Eastern issue, they argued it would ultimately be impractical and lack special effect. Furthermore, although the Japanese side stated they would discuss trade with European Russia – effectively recognizing the worker-peasant government – after discussing the Far Eastern issue, the Russian representative did not trust this. Thus, they merely discussed the Dairen proposal article by article formally. It was reported that British troops of all branches had already concentrated at the Dardanelles Strait (in preparation for dealing with Turkey).

September 19: It was the 29th birthday of Her Highness Queen Yi (Empress Sunjŏng). A customary inner palace banquet (內宴) was held in Ch'angdŏk Palace. A party of four Americans led by Dr. Eddy arrived in Kyŏngsŏng, reportedly to inspect (視察) the post-war national movement and economic conditions. Starting from the 21st, he gave several lectures (講演) at the Central Youth Hall, attracting crowds like clouds, but the main point of his lectures was merely a type of vain proselytizing common to them,<101> failing to attract any particular attention. The Changchun Conference continued, but the Japanese side insisted on adhering to the Dairen agreement proposal, aiming to make it effective immediately within the scope limited to the Far Eastern Republic, and expressing its intention regarding future trade issues with European Russia only through words. In contrast, the Russian side generally opposed this. The morning passed without result. In the afternoon, the Russian representative, Mr. Joffe, asked when the Japanese troop withdrawal would be completed and what would happen with the withdrawal of troops from North Sakhalin. Representative Matsui stated that the issue of stationing troops in North Sakhalin would be withdrawn along with the resolution of the Nikolaevsk Incident issue and should not be confused with the current conference. The Russian representative considered this unexpected, became very agitated, requested an adjournment to consult his home government, and the conference abruptly fell into a state of standstill (停頓). A rumor spread that the Government-General guard unit would be abolished due to personnel reductions resulting from arms limitation. Turkey hinted at its intention to consult with the powers regarding the freedom of the straits.

September 20: The Wang Chonghui cabinet in China was formally established. Looking at the appointments: Foreign Affairs Gu Weijun (Wellington Koo), Internal Affairs Sun Danlin, Finance Luo Wenhan, Army Zhang Shaozeng, Navy Li Dingxin, Justice Xu Qian, Education Tang Erhe, Agriculture and Commerce Gao Lingwei, Communications Gao Enhong. Most are affiliated with the Zhili clique. About 60 Japanese households residing in Sinanju, P'yŏngan Namdo, refused to pay the second installment of the household tax due today. French Prime Minister Poincaré declared that France would under no circumstances allow French troops currently stationed in the Near East to engage in military action against Kemal's forces, no matter what happens. The Wahhabi tribe in Egypt, stimulated by the victory of Kemal's forces, rebelled and threatened various cities in Egypt. The Pŏppohoe (法寶會 - Dharma Treasure Society) was initiated with the aim of popularizing Korean Buddhism. Mr. Han Yong'un is the chief manager, and its main task is first to translate the entire Buddhist scriptures into Korean script. A meeting of the Foreign Ministers of Britain, France, and Italy regarding the Near East issue opened in Paris.

September 21: Regarding the incident where Paechae students committed violence during the boys' baseball tournament last summer, representatives from various middle schools in the city had resolved not to participate in athletic meets where the Paechae School athletic team participated for the next five years. However, deciding there was no need to adhere to that resolution indefinitely, they immediately rescinded it. A lecture on social issues, hosted by the Korean Labor Convention (朝鮮勞働大會), was held inside the Ch'ŏndogyo Hall in Kyŏngwundong, Seoul. Mr. Kim Saguk's lecture was stopped midway, causing the entire hall to become noisy. By notification from the Japanese Ministry of Education, the Pusan Public Commercial Training School in Taesindong, Pusan-bu, was approved to be renamed Pusan Public Commercial School, and the Inch'ŏn Public Commercial Training School in Teramachi, Inch'ŏn-bu, was approved to be renamed Inch'ŏn Public Commercial School.<102> Mr. Kamenev of Worker-Peasant Russia was appointed acting Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and Chairman of the Defense Council in place of Mr. Lenin. The United States declared non-interference in the Near East issue. The plenary meeting of the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce's Tenant Farming Investigation Committee finalized the Tenant Dispute Mediation Bill (total 42 articles). US President Harding signed the new tariff law, putting it into effect.

September 22: A lecture on the Korean problem, hosted by the Jiyū Tōkyūsha (自由討究社 - Free Inquiry Society, managed by Japanese Mr. Hosoi Hajime), was held at the Kanda Youth Hall in Tokyo, Japan. The speakers were Hosoi Hajime, Nagai Ryūtarō, Uchigasaki Sakusaburō, and Shimada Saburō. The inaugural meeting of the Senman Kyōkai (鮮滿協會 - Korea-Manchuria Association) was held at the Seiyōken restaurant in Tsukiji, Tokyo, Japan. Over 200 Japanese individuals involved in Korea-Manchuria relations attended. The chairman at the meeting was Baron Gotō Shinpei. This association resulted from the merger of the Manchuria Association and the Korea Association, and the director was a person named Ōkita. The US Congress adjourned. The conference of Japanese consuls on the US Pacific coast resolved to request the US government to allow Japanese children born in the US to renounce their loyalty to Japan and become fully US citizens, as declared by Consul General Yada in San Francisco.

September 23: An extraordinary general meeting of the Korean Labor Mutual Aid Society (朝鮮勞働共濟會) was held inside the Ch'ŏndogyo Hall. With 97 members attending and 60 observers, the atmosphere in the hall was uneasy from the start. Immediately upon opening, a dispute arose over the membership qualification of the provisional chairman, Mr. Cha Kŭmbong. A faction of about 30 members sympathetic to the current leadership of the society walked out midway. The remaining several dozen members, primarily manual laborers, convened, amended the rules, and elected new officers. An exhibition of paintings by Ŭijae Hŏ Paengnyŏn, whose name suddenly became famous for his skill in Oriental painting after winning second place in the first Chosŏn Art Exhibition, was held inside Posŏng High Normal School. The Kaesŏng Branch Prison (Juvenile Prison) of Kyŏngsŏng Prison was completed, and the opening ceremony was held on this day. This was the first time a juvenile branch prison was established in Korea. Numerous suspicions regarding the missing Czech weapons under the custody of the 11th Division dispatched to Vladivostok were first published through Japanese newspapers. (Compare with the article and remarks for the 30th below.)

September 24: Mr. Sin Kyusik passed away at a lodging house in Shanghai at 9:30 AM on this day. He was 44 years old. Born in Injari, Kadŏkmyŏn, Ch'ŏngju-gun, Ch'ungch'ŏng Pukto, he entered the Official Han Language School in Kyŏngsŏng at age 17, graduated, entered the Military Academy at age 21, served as an Army Staff Lieutenant, and was promoted to Vice-Lieutenant. When the Hague Incident occurred in June of the Chŏngmi year (1907) and the Korean army was consequently disbanded, he resigned indignantly. He then joined the Taehan Hyŏphoe (大韓協會 - Great Han Association), dedicating himself to the movement to retrieve the situation, while also dabbling in education and industry. When Japan annexed Korea in the Kyŏngsul year (1910), he abruptly left his homeland the following October and headed for China. For the more than ten springs and autumns since, he suffered hardship and lived in solitude. When the Kimyŏn (1919) national movement arose and patriots from abroad gathered like clouds in Shanghai to organize an organ for advancing the national movement, Mr. Sin became the Minister of Justice of the Provisional Government, devoting his efforts. He had particularly deep connections with Chinese revolutionaries like Sun Yat-sen and Chen Qimei, engaging in much negotiation with the Guangdong government. Until his illness worsened due to nervous exhaustion, his dedication to state affairs was unwavering. The verdict in the trial of Kim Iksang was delivered at the Nagasaki District Court in Japan; the sentence was life imprisonment. Both Kim Iksang and the prosecutor of the court appealed. Forty members of the Independence Corps attacked the Yŏngsŏng police substation in Samsu-gun, Hamgyŏng Namdo, and retreated. The Changchun Conference, which reopened at 3:00 PM this day, finally broke down at 4:30 PM, and the Japanese representative issued a declaration. Since opening on the 4th, this conference had adjourned 5 times, with the number of days of actual meetings totaling only 11. The direct cause of the breakdown was the issue of troop withdrawal from North Sakhalin. Japan wanted to separate this from the current conference and discuss it together with the resolution of the Nikolaevsk Incident, whereas the Russian side insisted it absolutely could not be discussed separately and demanded clarification of the withdrawal timing first.

September 25: Kyŏngsŏng Chongno Police Station confiscated 2 *kwan* (approx. 7.5 kg) of secretly sold opium in the city. The autumn Sŏkchŏn festival (Confucian ceremony)<104> was held at the Kyŏnghakwŏn within Tongdaemun, Kyŏngsŏng. The League of Nations General Assembly approved the arms reduction plan to be implemented from 1923. The main point is that European countries should limit their respective military budget proposals to the same level as in 1913 (before the Great War). The cabinet of Turkish Grand Vizier Tewfik Pasha resigned en masse, and it is said a National Party cabinet will succeed it. The Government-General announced the first rice harvest forecast. This year's rice crop is generally abundant except for four provinces. The estimated actual yield for all of Korea this year is 15,104,241 *sŏk*, which is an increase of over 890,000 *sŏk* compared to last year's actual yield of 14,203,270 *sŏk*, representing a 6.3% increase.

September 26: The 15th Annual Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Korea opened within the Chŏngdong Church in Kyŏngsŏng for a scheduled week. Reports on evangelism over the past year and research on missionary policy for the upcoming year were the main agenda items. King Constantine of Greece abdicated, and Crown Prince George succeeded to the throne. This was prompted by signs of revolution erupting within the country following the defeat by Turkey. Incidentally, the now-deposed king had succeeded his father George I after his assassination in 1913, ascended the throne, was deposed in September 1917 on suspicion of pro-German tendencies due to his relationship as brother-in-law to the former German Emperor, was reinstated in December 1920, and reigned until today, only to be deposed again. The second report meeting on the Niigata Prefecture Korean Massacre Incident Investigation was held inside the Kyŏngsŏng Ch'ŏndogyo Hall. After reports by Messrs. Na Kyŏngsŏk and Kim Kich'an and a speech by Mr. Kim Han, a three-point countermeasure was decided upon, along with establishing a permanent investigation body regarding Korean laborers in Japan. The meeting closed amidst extreme excitement from the crowd.

September 27: Students of the Ch'ŏndogyo Chonghakwŏn (Seminary) went on a collective class boycott. The main reason was the desire for further improvement of facilities. Later, an understanding was reached with the educational authorities at the central headquarters of the church, and the issue was resolved accordingly. The Korean Youth Federation (朝鮮靑年聯合會) began a lecture tour through the Honam region this time. The speakers were Messrs. Kim Ch'ŏlsu and Sin T'aek'ak. The designated lecture locations included Ich'ŏn and 27 other places.

September 28: Administrative Superintendent Ariyoshi, who had traveled to Japan to discuss the Government-General's budget proposal for the next fiscal year with the central government, returned to Kyŏngsŏng. According to him, the import tariff (移入稅) on goods imported from Japan to Korea will be abolished entirely except for alcohol and textiles. Due to this, the usual import tariff revenue of 6.2 million Won will likely be halved, he said. Rumors circulated through newspapers<105> that the conspiracy by Japan's Chief of the General Staff Uehara and his faction to establish a buffer state encompassing the Maritime Province and Manchuria-Mongolia was steadily progressing through collusion (欸を通じ) with Zhang Zuolin of Fengtian and the White Army in the Maritime Province.

September 29: The issue of the Czech weapons under the custody of the Japanese army in Vladivostok going missing became a serious problem for the Japanese government. Amidst widespread discussion that these were sold to Zhang Zuolin, the Japanese government held a cabinet meeting on this day. The Turkish Ankara government responded to the joint démarche of the Allied Powers, stating that it accepts the Allied hopes on the condition that Constantinople and Eastern and Western Thrace be immediately returned to Turkey, and also agreed to meet with Allied commissioners in Mudanya to determine the scope of the future peace conference.

Remark: To summarize the missing weapons issue, when the Czech Legion passed through Vladivostok in January 1921, the commander of the Japanese expeditionary force's 11th Division, with the agreement of the White Army commander, made an agreement with the Czechs to guard 19 train cars of weapons and other goods. While undertaking this responsibility, in April of the same year, the 9th Division left and the 11th Division took over. As the commander of that division was about to take over the guarding duty, relations between Russia and the Czech forces were poor at the time. In January of this year, all items were opened to the three countries, but the 19 cars of weapons alone continued to be guarded by the Japanese army based on the Japan-Russia agreement of 1920 (related to the Japanese army taking responsibility for maintaining peace and traffic in Vladivostok). In early August of this year, upon inspection suggested by the Czech side, it was discovered that all the said freight cars were empty – that is, the original cars containing the weapons had been removed and replaced with other empty cars. When the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs first investigated the origin of this fact, subtle signs emerged that the weapons in question had fallen into the hands of Zhang Zuolin in Fengtian. This first provoked covert strife between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of the Army, and subsequently aroused suspicion both domestically and internationally.

October 1: From 1:00 PM, a memorial service (追悼會) for the late Mr. Sin Kyusik was held inside the Taejŏnggyo Namdo Headquarters in Kyedong, Kyŏngsŏng. Under the chairmanship of Mr. Cho Sŭngho, the ceremony concluded amidst mournful and poignant eulogies for Mr. Sin by Messrs. Kang Ch'ŏlgu (offering prayer), Kim Sun'gyu, Pak Sŭng'ik, Sin Kwi'yŏng, and Yi Chongwŏn. The Korean Food Product Fair opened inside the Kyŏngsŏng Public Hall (closed on the 4th). Three leaders of the Anfu clique, Zeng Yujun, Wang Zhilong, and Liang Hongzhi, who were under protection in the Japanese barracks in Beijing, escaped from Beijing. The Kyŏngsŏng municipal personnel counseling center and library preparations were completed; the counseling center opened on September 1st, and the library opened today. The founding convention of the Japanese Labor Union (日本勞働組合) opened yesterday, the 30th, inside the Tennōji Public Hall in Osaka. With 2 million laborers from all over Japan and the ideologues latent behind them stirring,<106> the atmosphere was extremely tense. Clashes (衝突) occasionally erupted between the over 200 policemen on guard and the attendees, making the situation increasingly perilous. Furthermore, members fiercely debated between a centrally concentrated union system and a locally autonomous federation system, ultimately failing to reach any decision and being dispersed by police order. The Kyŏngsŏng Management Bureau of the South Manchuria Railway Company implemented a 25% freight rate reduction for 10 types of daily necessities.

October 2: In Xialouhe, Kuandian County, China, 50 subordinates of Kwangbokkun (Restoration Army) Battalion Commander O Tongjin clashed (衝突) with Chinese local militia (保甲兵), with the militia faring poorly. Fifteen freight cars loaded with the problematic weapons arrived in Fengtian. Russian representative Mr. Joffe entered Beijing from Harbin. With the approval of the Ankara National Assembly, the Turkish army implemented a permanent ceasefire on all fronts from noon today.

October 3: Construction began on the Kyŏngsŏng Ch'ŏng'undong Public Normal School building with a grand budget of 140,000 Won. Around 10:00 PM, about 60 armed members of the Independence Army attacked Kosanjin, Kanggye, P'yŏngan Pukto. The Greco-Turkish armistice conference opened in the small town of Mudanya in Asia Minor. King George V of Britain issued an edict expressing the desire for the unified cooperation of the British people to prevent Thrace from being returned to Turkey regarding the Near East issue. The Japanese cabinet approved the establishment of the Korean Fuel Research Institute. The budget for this fiscal year allocated for this is 331,000 Won, and the investigation will primarily focus on lignite (褐炭) in Hamgyŏng Pukto and anthracite (無烟炭) in P'yŏngan Namdo, it is said. Government-General Secretary Moriya Eifu was dismissed from his post and assigned to handle affairs in the Secretariat's General Affairs Department. Head of the Educational Affairs Section Matsumura Shōsei replaced Mr. Moriya as Secretary.

October 4: To attend the 1st Pan-Pacific Commercial Conference, Mr. Kim Yunsu, Managing Director of the Kyŏngsŏng Tōyō Bussan Kaisha (東洋物産會社), departed Kyŏngsŏng together with Mr. Yi Chŏngbŏm of the Suan Kŭmgwang Hoesa (遂安金礦會社 - Suan Gold Mine Company). The Central Executive Committee of the Russian Communist Party decided on a compulsory military service plan. This requires all men aged 20 to 40 to serve for 3 months in the infantry or cavalry, while other branches and the navy require 4 years of service. Furthermore, the worker-peasant government was preparing to dispatch an economic investigation team to Tibet, which would naturally attract the attention of the British side. At the Mudanya Conference, opinions aligned on a draft treaty proposing the cession of Eastern Thrace to Turkey and placing Constantinople under the joint administration of the Allied Powers, Turkey, and the Kemal government. Mr. Lenin, disregarding his doctor's advice, resumed his duties. The current organizational structure of the Bank of Chosŏn is one bureau and seven departments (General Affairs Bureau and Business, Research, Personnel, Inspection, Branch, General Affairs, Accounting Departments<107>). This structure is being revised, and personnel are being significantly reorganized. On this day as well, Chief Cashier Izumi and 22 others were laid off.

October 5: An exhibition of Yi Dynasty pottery, organized by Mr. Yanagi Sōetsu, opened inside the Peers' Club in Hwanggŭmjŏng (Koganechō), Kyŏngsŏng. About 400 types of pottery (陶器) were displayed and open to the public for three days. Initiated by Mr. Cho Ch'ŏrho, the physical education teacher at Chung'ang High Normal School, the Korean Boy Scout Army (朝鮮少年斥候軍) was organized. As is generally known, this boy scout movement began when British Lieutenant General Baden-Powell, struggling during the South African War, gave military knowledge and training to the young boys in the besieged town, enabling them to sing songs of triumph in coordination with arriving relief forces. From that time, Britain gained 400,000 boy scouts within less than 3 years. They primarily served as scouts in the recent European Great War. In China, too, under the name Tongjajun (童子軍 - Boy Army), such groups have been organized since the 4th year of the Republic (1915) and are responsible for maintaining order at public gatherings today. In Korea, since last year, boys' associations have sprung up in various places, presenting a kind of new phenomenon. Now, we see the initiation of the Boy Scout Army. French Minister of Justice (司法卿) Louis Barthou assumed the position of Chairman of the Reparations Committee. Sweden put the issue of implementing a prohibition law to a national referendum. With 924,874 votes against prohibition versus 880,978 votes in favor, the prohibition bill was rejected.

October 6: Xu Shuzheng of China issued a telegram from Yanping, Fujian Province, declaring the establishment of the Jianguojun (建國軍 - National Construction Army) Military Government in Fuzhou, appointing himself as Director-General, and expressing his intention to support Duan Qirui and Sun Yat-sen. He immediately dispatched troops and declared war on Fujian Military Governor Li Houji.

October 7: Chŏn Kyut'ae, a policeman working at the Sŏngch'ŏn Police Station in P'yŏngan Namdo, severely beat a civilian named Chŏng Wŏnjun, causing great agitation among the local populace. The first Korean Bar Examination, which had earlier conducted its written test (筆記試驗), concluded today with the oral examination (口述試驗). The successful candidates were Mr. Yi Chongsŏng and 3 others. There were 30 Korean and 80 Japanese examinees. Mr. Yi, who passed first, is a 33-year-old young man who graduated from the law department of the private Posŏng College in Taishō 4 (1915). The Paris Conference, composed of representatives from Britain, France, and Italy, agreed on the following: (1) Greek<108> residents and troops will immediately withdraw from Thrace, (2) one month after the completion of the Greek troop withdrawal, Turkish gendarmerie and administrative officials will govern Thrace, (3) after the conclusion of peace, the Turkish army will be permitted to administer Thrace, and thereafter Thrace will be fully returned to Turkish sovereignty. Japanese merchants and industrialists in Kimch'ŏn, Kyŏngsang Pukto, whose activities have been noteworthy, organized the Kimch'ŏn Chamber of Commerce and Industry to establish systematic plans for commercial and industrial development, holding the inaugural ceremony on this day. His Imperial Highness Prince Kan'in, President of the Japanese Red Cross Society, arrived in Kyŏngsŏng (staying 4 days) for the 3rd General Meeting of the society's Korean headquarters.

October 8: The Greek government publicly announced its acceptance of the troop withdrawal from Thrace. The general meeting of the Japanese Red Cross Korean headquarters was held inside the Secret Garden (Piwŏn) of Ch'angdŏk Palace. Approximately 5,000 members participated, including about 1,000 Korean members. Mr. Yi Hŭijik, who had been a supporter of the former Kiho Hakhoe (畿湖學會) and contributed significantly to the educational world, passed away at his home in P'yŏngdongni, Paegunmyŏn, Chech'ŏn-gun.

October 9: Chiyako (33), wife of Major Hara, who is drawing attention as the person responsible for the P'o'am (Urasoko?) weapons issue, was traveling from Kagoshima to her younger brother's house in Yongsan, Kyŏngsŏng. Fearing the consequences of her husband's actions in this matter, she left a long suicide note and threw herself into the middle of the Genkai Sea.

October 10: Mr. Sin Hŭng'u, General Secretary of the Central Christian Youth Association (YMCA), departed to attend the International Christian Secretaries' Conference to be held in New York, USA, this November, and the World Alliance of YMCAs Representative Conference starting in May next year. Around 11:00 PM, in Tongsinni, northeast of Hyesanjin, 80 members of the Independence Army clashed with local police officers. After one death on each side, they disappeared towards Hakdŏngnyŏng pass.

October 11: The Mudanya Agreement was concluded. The 4th Kyŏngsang Namdo Brewed Products Fair (釀造品 品評會) opened inside the Pusan Chamber of Commerce (for 3 days).

October 12: Lieutenant General Harington announced the conclusion of the Anglo-Turkish agreement. Martial law (戒嚴令) was declared throughout Greece. The Wang Chonghui cabinet in China carried out procedures for mass resignation, but Finance Minister Luo Zhigan and Communications Minister Gao Enhong opposed it. Administrative Superintendent Ariyoshi began a tour of inspection in Northern Korea, accompanied by Internal Affairs Bureau Director Ōtsuka.

October 13: Under the guise of administrative reorganization, the Japanese cabinet decided to abolish the National Census Board (國勢院) and establish a Statistics Bureau directly under the Cabinet. The Japanese cabinet decided to fundamentally purge (廓淸) the hitherto lax lending policies regarding loans by special banks in Korea, Taiwan, etc., and enforce discipline. Hayakawa Senkichirō, President of the South Manchuria Railway Company, passed away. He assumed the presidency last year and earned trust both domestically and internationally for his noble character. Former Vice Minister of Home Affairs Kawamura Takeji was appointed as his successor.<109> A part of the Government-General's division of duties regulations was revised, changing the Statistics Section to the Research Section, responsible for managing statistical investigation and supervision, investigation and introduction of internal and external situations, and matters related to various reports and printed materials. The Japanese government decided that the weapons kept by the Japanese army, along with the withdrawal of troops stationed in Vladivostok, would be handed over to the Vladivostok autonomous group under the condition that they not be diverted or resold elsewhere.

October 14: Major Hara Sōichi of the Kagoshima Infantry 45th Regiment attachment, responsible for the weapons issue, was imprisoned in the Kumamoto Garrison Prison. His trial began on this day. Major Hara testified that he forged the division commander's order and handed it over to the Japanese army, striving to take responsibility himself. Japan's Vice Minister of the Army, Kojima Sōjirō (former Government-General Police Affairs Superintendent), died of lung disease. The Chinese government decided to dismiss Fujian Military Governor Li Houji, abolish the post of Fujian Military Governor, and appoint Sa Zhenbing as Provincial Governor (省長) of the same region. The Chinese government requested a loan of 70 million Yuan from the banking consortium for the purpose of consolidating foreign debts managed by the Ministry of Finance. The 3rd All-Korea Baseball Tournament, hosted by the Chosŏn Sports Association, opened at the Paechae School field in Chŏngdong, Kyŏngsŏng. Participating teams included, from the student side: Kyesŏng from Taegu, Osan from Chŏngju, Sungsil from P'yŏngyang, Songdo High Normal from Kaesŏng, and Chung'ang, Paechae, Hwimun, Kyŏngsin middle schools from Kyŏngsŏng; and from the club side: Sungsil, Pandŏ, Paechae, Yŏnhŭi, Chung'ang, Taegu, etc., totaling 14 teams. After fierce competition on the 14th, 16th, and 17th, Paechae School won on the student side, and Chung'ang Sports Club won on the social side, concluding the event without incident. The 5th General Meeting of the Korean Labor Mutual Aid Society Kyŏngsŏng Headquarters was held this night inside the Ch'ŏndogyo Hall, but the struggle between the faction of the aforementioned Mr. Cha Kŭmbong and the faction of the current executive, Mr. Pak Ilgyu, continued, failing to reach any conclusion and ending in adjournment. Such struggles among the headquarters members in Kyŏngsŏng eventually led to its dissolution (循致).

October 15: The four cram schools in Kyŏngsŏng city – Tong'a, Taedong, Hansŏng, and Chŏngch'ik – jointly held an autumn athletic meet inside Changch'ungdan park. Japanese Diet member Arakawa Gorō and two others arrived in Kyŏngsŏng. About 500 members of the Tonggwanghoe (同光會) in Kyŏngsŏng turned out to welcome them, presenting a spectacle rarely seen recently. Sun Yat-sen in Shanghai hinted that his opinions largely coincided with those of Zhang Zuolin. Legal Affairs Bureau Director Yokota traveled to Japan carrying the revised draft laws for the Civil Code and Criminal Procedure. The main points of this revision include limiting the age for marriage in the Civil Code to 17 for males and 15 for females, and allowing divorce lawsuits from the woman's side if there are legitimate grounds.

October 16: Governor-General Saitō traveled to Japan. Government-General Educational Affairs Bureau Director Shibata Zenzaburō was reassigned as Governor of Mie Prefecture, and former Yamanashi Prefecture Governor<110> Nagano Miki was appointed to replace him. Mr. Nagano is said to be a person with scholarly refinement but little political skill. At the Kumamoto 6th Division court-martial, the second trial for Major Hara, the victim of the aforementioned weapons issue, was held. After concluding the formal questioning, the prosecutor stated that the defendant's crime corresponds to Article 98 of the Army Penal Code – issuing false military orders while in the army – and requested a sentence of 2 years' imprisonment. The Japanese cabinet issued a statement regarding the missing weapons issue. Its main points were (1) acknowledging the loss of Czech weapons guarded by the Vladivostok expeditionary force, but implicitly suggesting it might be attributable to individual error, and (2) stating that confiscated weapons were securely stored, thereby denying that confiscated or guarded weapons were handed over to others. The coronation ceremony of the King and Queen of Romania took place. Their Majesties ascended the throne after the death of the previous king in 1914, but the ceremony was postponed until today due to the Great War.

October 17: Germany handed over Treasury bonds worth 47.5 million Goldmarks to the Allied Reparations Committee. The Vladivostok City Council held an emergency meeting, refused to accept the confiscated weapons that had been guarded by the Japanese army, and decided not to assume any responsibility regarding this matter. The Philippine Assembly was convened.

October 18: Eighteen farmers from Chin'gokri, Sŏjongmyŏn, Pongsŏn-gun, Hwanghae Province, angered that their landlord, Ch'oe Chongsŏk, intended to collect rent according to the old precedent despite the notorious flood damage this year, rushed to the county office with all their harvested grain and pleaded pitifully (哀願). A group of meddlers concerned about the world (憂世客) in Kyŏngsŏng had continued secret struggles and infighting (暗鬪肉鬪) for years over the organization called the "Korean Labor Mutual Aid Society." By today, however, with the awakening of the actual laborers themselves, that influence was swept away. The problematic Korean Labor Mutual Aid Society was dismantled, and based on a body formed by genuine laborers, the Labor Federation (勞働聯盟) was organized on this day. Twenty central executive committee members were selected, and a three-point platform and declaration were issued. Its main principles and activities are the construction of a new society, the development of knowledge and technology, and striving for unity and solidarity based on class consciousness. Its constituent members were the Kamp'o Labor Mutual Aid Society, Andong Labor Mutual Aid Society, Taegu Labor Mutual Aid Society, Chinju Labor Mutual Aid Society, Pandŏ Rubber Workers' Union, Western Clothing Workers' Union, Tramway Employees' Association, Barbers' Union, Noyuhoe (勞友會 - Labor Friends Association), and Printing Workers' Friendship Society. A welcome banquet for Diet member Arakawa Gorō and two others, who had come to Kyŏngsŏng specifically for preparations related to attendance at the 46th session of the Japanese Diet, was held this night at Myŏngwŏlgwan. Due to special propaganda by the Tonggwanghoe and Naejŏng Tongniphoe (內政獨立會 - Internal Administration Independence Association) side, the number of people gathered for sightseeing or as a distraction neared two hundred.<111> As the banquet was about to begin, turmoil suddenly erupted in a corner of the room. Shouts arose demanding the killing of everyone involved in the so-called internal administration independence. Mr. Mun Tŏk was severely beaten, while others fled, turning the venue into a scene of carnage. At that moment, among the youth, Mr. Kim Yŏnhŭi directly stated where the true demands of Koreans lay today, urging the attention of Arakawa's party. The meeting then dispersed. Messrs. Yi Hangbal, Chŏn Il, Sŏ Sŏngdal, Kim T'aegyu, and Kim Yŏnhŭi were the individuals among the attendees that night who expressed the sentiments of Koreans.

October 19: With the withdrawal of the Japanese army, clashes between the Russian Red and White armies in the Siberian Maritime Province area intensified. The Red Army of the Chita government attempted to occupy Vladivostok before the completion of the Japanese withdrawal, which the Japanese army opposed. On the morning of this day, Japanese and Russian forces clashed at a point 30 *ri* north of Vladivostok, killing one Japanese sentry. The situation within Vladivostok city became extremely unstable. British Prime Minister Lloyd George, known as the dictator of Britain, submitted his resignation. It is said the successor will be Bonar Law, leader of the Unionist Party.

October 20: It was the birthday of His Highness Crown Prince Yi (Yi Un). The Office of Prince Yi sent a congratulatory telegram to the Toriizaka residence in Tokyo.

Conclusion

This account of the changes in the world and Korea during these two months has become, admittedly, somewhat disjointed to read. Now, to conclude the situation of the world and Korea during that period with extremely simple single phrases, it is as follows:
First, looking across to Europe and America, the railroad strike in the US, which had dragged on for several months, was effectively resolved. In the Near East, the Greco-Turkish war, which had been ongoing for some time, suddenly ended in a major victory for the Turkish Kemal forces, leading to a situation where a Near East peace conference including representatives from Britain, France, Italy, Romania, Greece, Turkey, etc., is expected to be held. British Prime Minister Lloyd George, who rose to prominence through participation in the European Great War and was known as the manipulator of all Europe until today, resigned from his post. These are notable examples from that side. Turning our eyes back to the East, in China, since the Fengtian-Zhili War, the political situation has become even more chaotic. Secret envoys travel between Sun Yat-sen in the south and <112>Zhang Zuolin in Fengtian. Subsequently, the leaders of the Anfu clique escaped from the Japanese barracks, Xu Shuzheng in Fuzhou raised troops supporting Duan Qirui and Sun Yat-sen, and the sinister Zhang Zuolin constantly purchases weapons through connections (款を通じ) with one side in Vladivostok, making the situation highly unusual. Japan, due to the issue of missing weapons guarded by the Vladivostok expeditionary force, has exposed its shame from within the inner chambers (蕭墻內) and still doesn't know what to do. Preceded by the breakdown of the Changchun Conference, Japan and Russia are effectively in a state of severed diplomatic relations. Correspondingly, the commencement of organized activities by the Korean Independence Army in Russian and Chinese territories is an important aspect of the current situation. Finally, observing the recent situation in our Korea, the economic impact resulting from Japan's financial retrenchment, price reductions, and abundant harvest has directly spread to Korea. Grain prices have fallen, drastically reducing the purchasing power of rural villages, leading to sluggish markets. Banks, starting with the Bank of Chosŏn, are extremely cautious about lending. Along with the general slump in the financial world, public morale has declined, and cries of hardship in business and life are loud everywhere. Although several magazines were recently permitted under the Newspaper Law, somewhat invigorating the world of speech, there is nothing yet particularly noteworthy. Due to the impending opening of the 46th session of the Japanese Diet, the usual opposition party Diet members frequently visit Kyŏngsŏng. In response, some individuals advocating political union, such as Song Pyŏngjun and the Tonggwanghoe side, are bustling about, but this is limited to a very small number of people, a kind of speculation capitalizing on the current situation by schemers without any foundation whatsoever; the general public is not involved. Lastly, what requires attention is that our public sentiment recently has tilted towards becoming extraordinarily steadfast and poignant compared to last year or even this spring, such that everyone seems to have begun to think seriously.<113>

**Summary**

This article chronicles events in Korea and the world during September and October 1922. International developments include the Greco-Turkish War's conclusion favoring Turkey, political shifts like Lloyd George's resignation in Britain and cabinet changes in China and Greece, the breakdown of Japan-Russia talks in Changchun, and League of Nations activities. Korean events highlight ongoing independence movement activities (fundraising, attacks on Japanese facilities, organizing abroad), social issues (labor disputes, tenant farmer protests, flood relief efforts), government actions (price controls, budget discussions, personnel changes, censorship adjustments), cultural happenings (art exhibitions, new publications, religious events), and public responses like student boycotts and activism regarding Japanese abuses (Niigata massacre investigation). The economic situation in Korea is portrayed as worsening due to falling grain prices and tight credit, despite a good harvest.

From a colonial history perspective, the article is revealing for its detailed tracking of both overt resistance (Independence Army actions, political prisoner protests) and subtler forms of social mobilization (labor organizing, student activism, relief societies, cultural promotion like Buddhist translation and Boy Scouts). It highlights the tensions between Japanese authorities/settlers and Koreans (police brutality, landlord conflicts, discrimination issues like the Niigata massacre). The commentary on the "Cultural Rule" era is implicit but clear: despite surface changes like magazine permits, underlying repression, economic hardship linked to colonial policy, and Korean aspirations for self-determination remained strong, with public sentiment reportedly growing more "steadfast and poignant." The mention of Japanese internal conflicts (weapons scandal) and international diplomacy (Changchun failure, China situation) provides context for Japan's colonial management challenges.

먼저 歐米의 便을 건너다 보면 米國에 잇서는 몃 달을 끌고 오더 鐵道罷業이 事實上으로 解決되고 近東에 잇셔서는 일즉부터 開戰中이던 希土戰이 문득 土國 케말軍의 大勝에 歸하야 英·佛·伊·羅·希·土 等 諸國의 代表를 含한 近來 講和會議의 開催를 致할 形勢에 至한 것이며 歐洲大戰의 參加를 以하야써 成立되어 今日에까지 至하며 全歐洲의 操縱者의 稱이 有하던 英首相 로이드·쪼지가 其職을 辭한 것과 如함은 그 便의 著例됨을 不失하며 다시 눈을 구을러 東方을 보면 中國에는 一自奉直戰爭以後 政界는 一層 紛紜한 中 南方의 孫文과 奉天의 ＜112＞張作霖間에 密使가 來往하며 繼하야 安福의 禍首가 日本 兵營을 脫出하고 福州의 徐樹錚이 段祺瑞와 孫文을 推戴하야 兵을 起하며 陰鬼의 張作霖은 海蔘威의 一邊의 側과 款을 通하야 不斷히 武器를 購入하는 等 其勢가 甚히 異常하며 日本은 海蔘威 派遣軍의 保管武器紛失問題로 蕭墻內에서 其醜를 發說하야 尙今 如何히 할 줄을 모르는 것과 是에 先한 長春會議의 破裂로 因하야 日露는 事實上의 國交斷絶 狀態에 在한 바 是와 相應하야 露·中領에 在한 朝鮮獨立軍이 組織的 活動을 開始한다 함과 如함은 重要한 現狀의 一됨을 不失하며 最後로 우리 朝鮮의 最近 形便을 觀하면 日本國의 金融縮小, 物價引下, 年事豊登으로 生하는 經濟的 影響은 그대로 朝鮮에 波及되어 穀價는 下落하야 農村의 購買力은 極端으로 減退되어 市况이 不振하며 朝鮮銀行을 始한 各 銀行은 貸出을 極히 警戒하야 一般 財界의 不振과 共히 人氣-消沈하야 事業難, 生活難의 聲이 四處에 高하며 先者 幾種의 雜誌가 新聞紙法에 依하야 許可되야 言論界가 多少 活氣를 帶한 것과 如하나 아즉 特記할 것이 無하고 日本의 46回 議會開期과 在迫함을 因하야 例의 野黨側 代議士輩가 頻頻 入京하는 代에 宋秉畯, 同光會側과 如한 政合邦을 主唱하는 一部의 者가 此間에 奔走함이 不無하나 是는 極少數者에 限한 何等의 根底도 不有한 一種 時局을 資本한 投機師의 作事에 不過하는 바 一般은 此에 關知하는 바도 아니라 最終으로 注意할 것은 近來의 우리 人心은 昨年이나 또는 今春보다도 非常히 着實, 辛辣한 便으로 傾하야 모도가 한번 생각하기를 始作함과 如한 그것이라 하겟다.＜113＞
