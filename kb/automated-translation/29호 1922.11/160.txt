The New Educational System of the Republic of China
						Excerpted by One Reporter

On September 20th of this year, the Ministry of Education summoned education representatives from each province and other renowned figures from the academic world to open an Educational System Conference. Various proposals regarding the educational system from the Ministry of Education and representatives of each province were submitted. The first item discussed was the School System Reform Plan, along with the Provincial District Educational Administrative Organ Establishment Advisory Council Plan. The School System Reform Plan proposed by the Ministry of Education was passed, establishing a total 24-system structure.

1. School System Reform Plan
(Ministry of Education Proposal)

The current school system is that which resulted from the resolution of the Provisional Education Conference in the first year of the Republic (1912). Since its adoption and implementation by this ministry, ten years have already passed. As times have changed, there are inevitably aspects requiring modification. Therefore, based on the standards listed below, the School System Reform Plan is proposed as follows.

1. Standards
1. To plan for the development of education by basing it on educational principles and conforming to world trends.
2. To make education easily widespread by adapting it to the actual circumstances of the regions.
3. To leave much room for flexibility so that each region can implement it酌量 (considering their circumstances).
4. To make reforms easy to undertake by taking the old system into consideration (顧及).

2. School Levels and Explanations
1. The duration of study for elementary school shall be limited to 6 years, divided into higher and lower levels. The lower level duration shall be 4 years, and the higher level duration shall be 2 years.
However, depending on local circumstances, establishing only the lower level is permitted.
2. The compulsory education period shall be set at 6 years, but depending on local circumstances, temporarily using the lower level duration as the compulsory education period is also permitted.
3. Elementary schools, considering local circumstances, may add education for vocational preparation for lower-level graduates.
4. Elementary schools may also establish supplementary courses (補習科) of 1 or 2 years to cater to the supplementary studies of higher-level graduates.
5. Kindergartens (*養園, likely 幼稚園) shall be appropriately established (酌設) in regions to accommodate children aged 3 to 6 years old.
6. The subjects and duration of vocational schools shall be revised as needed, considering the actual needs and circumstances of each region. (Existing Type B Industrial Schools (乙種 實業學校) are to be renamed Vocational Schools.)
7. The duration of study for middle school shall be set at 6 years, divided into a 4-year lower level and a 2-year higher level.
8. Depending on local circumstances, middle schools may establish only the lower level, and the first 2 years may be affiliated with an elementary school.
9. Higher middle schools should be established jointly with lower middle schools, but if unavoidable, they may be established independently.
10. Lower middle schools shall provide general education (普遍敎育), while higher middle schools, in addition to offering a general course, may establish separate departments for Agriculture, Engineering, Commerce, Normal training, and Home Economics.
11. Higher middle schools may establish only one specialization or concurrently establish several departments.
Existing Type A Industrial Schools (甲種實業學校) are to be changed into Agriculture, Engineering, and Commerce departments within higher middle schools.
12. The duration of study for normal schools shall be set at 6 years, adopting a specialization system from the 4th year onwards.
13. The duration of study for professional schools (專門學校) shall be set at 4 or 5 years, admitting graduates of lower middle schools.
14. The duration of study for higher normal schools shall be set at 4 years, admitting graduates of lower middle schools.
15. The duration of study for universities shall be set at 4 or 5 years.
16. Universities may establish several departments or a single department.
However, those establishing only one department shall be called 'X Department University'. When professional schools raise their standards (程度를 提高하야) to admit higher middle school graduates, the duration of study shall be set at 4 or 5 years and they shall be renamed single-department universities. When higher normal schools raise their standards to admit higher middle school graduates, their duration of study shall be set at 4 years and they shall be renamed normal universities (師範大學?). [Translator's note: The text says 師範入學, which seems incomplete or possibly a typo for 師範大學].
17. Professional schools, single-department universities, and higher normal schools may all be established jointly within one institution.
18. Graduate schools are research institutes for university graduates and those holding equivalent qualifications; the duration is undetermined. <75>

**Summary**

This article reports on the Republic of China's Ministry of Education proposing a new educational system structure in September 1922. The reform aimed to modernize education based on educational principles, global trends, local needs, flexibility, and continuity with the previous system established in 1912. It detailed a 6-year primary (4+2), 6-year middle (4+2), vocational, normal, professional (4-5 years), higher normal (4 years), and university (4-5 years) system, including provisions for kindergartens, supplementary courses, and graduate schools, with specific pathways for upgrading professional and higher normal schools to university status.

From the perspective of Korean colonial history, this article is interesting because it details educational reforms in a neighboring country undergoing modernization, contrasting sharply with the often restrictive and assimilationist educational policies imposed by Japan in Korea during the same period. The emphasis on adapting to local needs, flexibility, and expanding access (including vocational and potentially higher education pathways) in the Chinese system might have been noted by Korean intellectuals reading *Kaebyŏk*, potentially highlighting the limitations they faced or offering alternative models for a future independent Korea's education system.
