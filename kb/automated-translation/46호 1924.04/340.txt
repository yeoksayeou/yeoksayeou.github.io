On the Spring Lawn
						Cho Myŏnghŭi

When I frolic on this lawn,
couldn't my mother watch this sight?

Like a young baby nestled in its mother's breast, acting cute,
when I roll about on this lawn,
couldn't my mother truly watch this sight?

Unable to endure the feeling of near madness,
I cried out, "Mommy! Mommy!"
The earth replied, "Why!" and the sky replied, "Why!"
I cannot tell which one is my mother. -3,16-

**Summary**

The poem expresses a deep, almost childlike longing for the speaker's mother while they are playing freely on a spring lawn. This yearning becomes so intense that the speaker calls out "Mommy!", only to hear the earth and sky respond, blurring the line between the mother figure and the natural world, leaving the speaker unable to distinguish their mother amidst the vastness. From a historical perspective, the poem, written during the Japanese colonial period, conveys a profound sense of personal longing and perhaps displacement. While overtly about a mother, the yearning for presence, comfort, and identity amidst an overwhelming, somewhat indifferent environment (the echoing earth and sky) could resonate with the broader national experience of loss and the search for connection during that era. Historians might find the blending of personal grief/longing with nature imagery, and the specific linguistic forms of the 1920s, of interest.

봄 잔듸밧 위에
						趙明熙
내가 이 잔듸밧 위에 뛰노닐 적에
우리 어머니가 이 모양을 보아 주실 수 읍슬가?

어린 아기가 어머이 젓가슴에 안겨 어리광함갓치
내가 이 잔듸밧 위에 짓둥그를 적에
우리 어머니가 이 모양을 참으로 보아주실 수 옵슬가?

밋칠듯한 마음을 견데지 못하여
「엄마! 엄마!」 소리를 내엿더니
땅이 「우애!」하고 하날이 「우애!」하음애
어나 것이 나의 어머니인지 알 수 읍서라.  -3,16-
