Reminiscences of Puyŏ
						Ch'ŏng'o

Sabi Castle (Two Poems)

(Also known as Panwŏl Castle, the ancient capital castle of Paekche)

Tang troops, one hundred thousand strong, besieged the castle by night,
The Paekche king and his ministers dared not contest.
Who remembers the magnificent achievements of Onjo?
In a fleeting moment, yielded to one Su Sheng (Su Ting-fang).

Leaving the kingdom for the ends of the earth, tears fall like silk threads,
Through myriad ages, the heartbreaking one is Ŭija.
By the Paengma River, the grasses long and short,
Come spring, are green and lush as ever.

P'yŏngje Stele (Pacifying Paekche Stele)

(Located near Puyŏ town, a monument commemorating the Silla-Tang armies' pacification of Paekche)

The tortoise-shaped base is peeled and worn, covered in green moss,
In the old pavilion, no people, only the mournful cries of birds.
Speak not of the deeds of pacifying Paekche back then,
The ancestral shrines of Silla and Tang have already turned to ash.

Choryongdae (Dragon Fishing Terrace)

(Traveling downstream from Hoam Rock south to the base of Pusosan mountain, there is a huge rock spanning the river islet. On the rock are traces where a dragon was caught. Legend has it that when the Tang general Su Ting-fang was attacking Paekche, he approached the river and wanted to cross, but suddenly a great storm arose. Using a white horse as bait, he fished and caught a dragon. Pulling it forcefully, he calmed [the river] and was thus able to cross. Hence the river is called Paengma [White Horse] and the rock is called Choryong [Dragon Fishing].)

The tale of butchering a horse to fish for a dragon seems dubious,
Yet the traces among the rocks are also wondrously strange.
Turning to watch the setting moon sink to the river bottom,
It looks just like the time the palace women fell into the water.

Nakhwaam (Falling Flowers Rock)

(West of Choryongdae in the north of the county, there is a huge rock. According to popular legend, when King Ŭija was defeated by Tang forces, palace women fled, climbed this rock, and fell into the river, hence the name.)

A solitary piece of rock amid the evening glow,
Falling flowers are silent in the misty rain.
The cuckoo cannot exhaust the regrets of that year,
Tears sprinkled on the east wind, point by point, red. <143>

Koran Temple

(North of Puyŏ County, there is a guardian mountain named Pusosan. On a cliff halfway up it is Koran Temple, an ancient temple of Paekche, overlooking the Paengma River. Because *koran* [a fragrant plant] grows naturally among the rocks, it was named thus.)

The temple sits on which peak of Pusosan?
From the river fortress at sunset, listening to the sparse temple bell.
The visitor comes not asking of rise and fall,
Only picks *koran* and descends towards Choryong[dae].

Paengma River Setting Moon - Hwangsan

The castle sank along with the White Horse [River] all at once,
The river moon, desolate and cold, the sorrow lingers even now.
How many heroes tried to retrieve but could not?
Below Choryongdae, the water is particularly deep.

P'yŏngje Pagoda Evening Glow

Cold crows, old trees, the river sky at dusk,
Remnant red light on the pagoda's face illuminates the ancient trace.
Below, the long river flows on unceasingly,
On the stone head, the dragon's blood is still blue-green today.

Kuryongp'o Landing Geese

Where dragons fought, ancient ruins, the autumn water recedes,
Geese sway under the lonely moon, descending to the flat sands.
Deep in the night, they cannot bear to fly south,
Tide beats the empty castle walls, the river is desolate.

Reminiscences of Hongju

Broken halberds, snapped swords west of the ancient castle,
Souls do not return to the mountains, ghosts cry in the night.
Exposed bones on the battlefield, spring arrives again,
Heartbreaking, the color of the grass, green and lush. <144>
<143-144>

**Summary**

This collection of poems by Ch'ŏng'o reflects on visits to historical sites primarily in Buyŏ, the last capital of the Paekche kingdom, and one poem on Hongju. The poet contemplates the ruins and landscapes—Sabi Castle, P'yŏngje Stele, Choryongdae, Nakhwaam, Koransa, the Paengma River, P'yŏngje Pagoda, Kuryongp'o, and Hongju Castle—evoking the sorrowful history of Paekche's fall to the Silla-Tang alliance and hinting at other past conflicts (Hongju). Themes of loss, the impermanence of human endeavors contrasted with enduring nature, and lingering grief permeate the verses. From a colonial history perspective, the poems are significant as they express deep nostalgia and mourning for a lost Korean kingdom during a period when Korea itself was under Japanese colonial rule. This focus on specific Korean historical sites and the pathos associated with national decline could be interpreted as a subtle expression of contemporary national sentiment and a way of preserving Korean identity and historical memory against colonial pressures.

扶餘懷古
						靑吾
泗泚城 二首

一名半月城卽百濟古都城

唐兵十萬夜圍城, 百濟君臣不敢爭. 誰識堂堂溫祚業, 片時讓與一蘇生.
天涯去國淚如絲, 萬古傷心是義慈. 白馬江邊長短草, 春來依舊綠離離.

平濟碑

在扶餘邑附近羅唐軍平百濟紀念碑

龜頭剝落滿蒼苔, 古閣無人鳥雀哀. 莫說當年平濟事, 羅唐宗社己成灰.

釣龍臺

自虎岩順流而南至扶蘇山下有一巨石跨江渚石上有龍獲之跡諺傳唐將蘇定方伐百濟臨江欲渡忽風雨大作以白馬爲餌而釣得一龍須曳開齊遂得渡故江曰白馬岩曰釣龍

屠馬釣龍事可疑, 石間遺跡亦奇奇. 回看落月沈江底, 正似宮人墜水時.

落花巖

在郡北釣龍臺西有巨岩俗傳義慈王爲唐兵所敗宮女奔迸登是巖墜于江故名

一片孤岩夕照中, 落花無語雨空濛. 子規不盡當年恨, 淚灑束風点点紅.＜143＞

臯蘭寺

扶餘郡北有鎭山名曰扶蘇其中腹絶壁上有臯蘭寺乃百濟古刹臨于白馬江石間臯蘭自生故因名

寺在扶蘇第幾峯, 江城落日聽踈鍾. 客來不問興亡事, 只採臯蘭下釣龍.

白馬江沈月-凰山

城隨白馬一時沈, 江月凄凄恨至今. 多少豪兒撈不得, 釣龍臺下水偏深.

平濟塔夕照

寒鴉老木江天夕, 塔面殘紅照古跡. 下有長流不盡流, 石頭龍血至今碧.

九龍浦落鴈

龍戰古墟秋水落, 鴈搖孤月下平漠. 夜深不忍向南飛, 潮打空城江寂寞.

洪州懷古

折戈斷釰古城西, 魂不歸山鬼夜啼. 露骨沙場春又至, 傷心草色綠萋萋.＜144＞
＜143-144＞
