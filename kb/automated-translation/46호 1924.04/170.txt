History, Location, Climate
This province (道) was anciently the land of Mahan (馬韓), became the territory of Paekche (百濟), was unified under Silla (新羅), and upon reaching Koryŏ (高麗), was called Honam-do (河南道) in the 14th year of King Sŏngjong. In the first year of King Yejong, it was combined with Kwan'nae-do (關內道) and renamed Yanggwang Ch'ungch'ŏngju-do (楊廣忠淸州道). In the first year of King Myŏngjong, it was divided into two provinces, then combined again in the first year of King Ch'ungsuk and called Yanggwang-do (楊廣道). In the 5th year of King Kongmin, it was renamed Ch'ungch'ŏng-do (忠淸道), a name retained by the Yi Dynasty (李朝). In the 32nd year of Yi T'aehwang (李太皇 - Emperor Kojong), it was divided into North and South provinces, and an Observation Bureau (觀察府) was established in Kongju (公州). After the Japan-Korea Annexation (日韓倂合), the system was changed to a Provincial Office (道廳), which continues to this day. Its location is bordered by Kyŏnggi-do (京畿道) to the north, Ch'ungch'ŏng-bukto (忠淸北道) to the east, Chŏlla-bukto (全羅北道) to the south, and the Yellow Sea (黃海) to the west. It occupies the area from 125 degrees 3 minutes to 127 degrees 3 minutes 6 ri east longitude, and 35 degrees 5 minutes 5 ri to 37 degrees 3 ri north latitude. It measures 23 ri 19 chō east to west, 25 ri north to south, with an area of 544 square ri 69 o. The climate is generally mild, with an average annual temperature of 11.9 degrees Celsius (53.4 degrees Fahrenheit).

Administrative Divisions & Households, Population
This province was previously divided into 37 counties (郡) and 392 townships (面). Following the county and township consolidation (郡面 廢合) in Taishō 3 (1914), it is now divided into 14 counties, 175 townships, and 2,250 villages (町里).
The current households (戶口) and population (人口) are: Koreans 211,260 households, 1,123,618 people; Japanese 4,823 households, 17,208 people; Foreigners 531 households, 1,908 people. The grand total (摠計) is 21,661 households, 1,142,734 people. Since the annexation, the average annual increase has been 1,873 households and 24,840 people. Among these figures, particularly surprising (可驚할 것) is the rapid increase (激增) of Japanese people. At the beginning of the annexation, there were only 2,317 households and 7,330 people, but by the end of Taishō 9 (1920), this had reached 4,595 households and 16,814 people, approximately double compared to the time of annexation (it goes without saying that it has increased further since then). However, the area of each county in this province ranges from a minimum of 25 square ri to a maximum of 69 square ri, and the population ranges from a minimum of 51,795 people to a maximum of 123,210 people. Among the provinces of Korea (朝鮮), the population is relatively dense (稍密하고), and transportation is comparatively developed.
Furthermore, regarding human sentiment (人情), customs (風俗), and language (言語), there are some differences depending on the locality, but generally, they are similar (근사한데) to Kyŏnggi. As it has traditionally (自來) been the base of the so-called Yangban (兩班), class consciousness is still prevalent (多하고), and there is a tendency towards idleness (遊逸) and indolence (安惰), valuing empty formalities and etiquette (虛文虛禮). The standard of living also varies greatly due to the significant gap (懸隔한) between rich and poor. <109> Most people are farmers and simultaneously poor. Recently, financial stagnation (金融의 梗塞), the fall (低落) in grain prices, and increased taxation (課稅의 增加) have brought great hardship to the rural villages. If the current situation continues, it is feared that within just a few years, everyone will be on the verge of bankruptcy (破産의 境에 瀕하얏는데). General public sentiment, unable to attain security in livelihood, shows a tendency towards gradual radical change (漸次 激變하는 傾向).

Education and Religion
Korean Education: Ch'ungch'ŏngnam-do Public Normal School 1, teachers 7, classes 3, students 150; Agricultural School 1, teachers 8, classes 3, students 120; Kanggyŏng Public Commercial School 1, teachers 7, classes 3, students 121; Taejŏn Public Vocational Supplementary School 1, teachers 4, classes 2, students 38; Public Common Schools 89, teachers 431, students 17,723; General Private Schools 2, teachers 7, students 219; Religious Private Schools 8, teachers 28, students 876; Seodang (書堂 - traditional village schools) 1,291, teachers 13,555 (likely a typo, perhaps meant students?), students 14,013; Kongju, Hongju Kindergartens 2, teachers 5, students 99. Annual operating expenses (經常費) per student: Normal School 317 Wŏn (圓), Agricultural School 163 Wŏn, Commercial School 178 Wŏn, Vocational School 131 Wŏn, Common School 42 Wŏn, General Private School 14 Wŏn, Religious Private School 11 Wŏn, Seodang 10 Wŏn, Kindergarten 13 Wŏn. Japanese Education: Public Higher Girls' School 1, teachers 6, students 162; Public Elementary Schools 32, teachers 85, students 2,672; Taejŏn Kindergarten 1, teachers 2, students 790. Annual operating expenses per student: Higher Girls' School 278 Wŏn, Elementary School 80 Wŏn, Kindergarten 13 Wŏn. Comparing the current 89 Common Schools to the 175 townships (面), this corresponds to roughly 1 school per 1.97 townships. Additionally, for secondary education, there is the Kongju Higher Common School (公州高等普通學校) educating Koreans, and the Taejŏn Government Middle School (太田官立中學校) for Japanese.
Religion: Christianity (基督敎), Buddhism (佛敎), Ch'ŏndogyo (天道敎), and Sich'ŏn'gyo (侍天敎) exist, but all are in a state of decline (不振). Christianity has 127 mission stations (布敎所), 9 foreign missionaries (宣敎師), 113 Korean missionaries, 12,208 Korean believers (信徒), 14 foreign believers, totaling 12,228. Buddhism has 80 temples (寺院 及 寺刹), 38 preaching places, 31 preachers (布敎師), 4,149 Korean believers, and 9,476 Japanese believers. Ch'ŏndogyo has 9 district offices (宗理院), 30 leaders (宗理師), and 6,585 believers. (Details for Sich'ŏn'gyo are unknown 未詳). <110>

**Summary**

This 1924 article provides a profile of Ch'ungch'ŏngnam-do (Ch'ungnam Province). It covers its history from ancient Mahan through various dynastic name changes and administrative reorganizations up to the Japanese colonial period. Geographically, it details its location, borders, size, and mild climate. Demographically, it notes a relatively dense population for Korea at the time, listing Korean, Japanese, and foreign resident numbers, while highlighting the significant post-annexation increase in the Japanese population. Socially, it characterizes the region as a traditional Yangban stronghold, resulting in lingering class consciousness, a tendency towards idleness, and emphasis on formalities, alongside severe economic disparity and growing rural distress due to financial issues, low crop prices, and high taxes. The education section contrasts the provision for Koreans (normal, agricultural, commercial, common schools, Seodang) and Japanese (higher girls', elementary schools, middle school), showing disparities in resources and school density. Finally, it mentions Christianity, Buddhism, Ch'ŏndogyo, and Sich'ŏn'gyo, noting their generally declining state, and providing statistics for adherents and facilities where available, interestingly noting a higher number of Japanese Buddhist adherents than Korean ones.

From a colonial history perspective, the article is revealing in its explicit mention and quantification of the rapid increase in Japanese residents ("particularly surprising"), underscoring the demographic shift under colonial rule. The description of widespread economic hardship among Korean farmers, directly linked to financial policies, crop prices, and taxation, points to the negative economic impacts of the colonial system on the rural populace. Furthermore, the stark statistical breakdown of the segregated education system, including per-student spending and school availability, clearly illustrates the inequality inherent in colonial educational policy. The mention of Buddhism having more Japanese than Korean adherents in the province is also noteworthy.
