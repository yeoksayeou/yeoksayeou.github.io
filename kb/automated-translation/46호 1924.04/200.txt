The Story of the Fall of the Paekche Kingdom

It is said that when a nation is about to fall (國家 將亡), there will certainly be ominous portents (妖孼). When Paekche was about to fall, there were various strange occurrences (妖怪). At Ch'osaengjin (草生津), the corpse of a woman of unknown origin washed ashore, measuring 18 ch'ŏk in length. Also, in broad daylight (白晝), a pack of foxes (衆狐) entered the royal palace (王宮), and one fox sat upon the desk (書案) of the Sangjwap'yŏng (上佐平). From a pagoda tree (槐樹) in the palace grounds, the sound of human weeping (人哭聲) was heard, and a dog resembling a wild deer (野鹿) appeared and barked towards the royal palace and the capital road (王道).

Among these, particularly strange was when a ghost (鬼) entered the palace, shouted loudly, "Paekche will fall! Paekche will fall!" (百濟亡百濟亡), and immediately entered the earth (地中). When this spot was dug up (掘), a turtle shell (龜背) was found. On it was writing (其文) that said (曰), "Paekche is like the full moon (百濟同月輪), Silla is like the new moon (新羅如月新)." King Ŭija (義慈王) had a shamaness (무녀) interpret this. She said (問), "Like the full moon (同月輪) means full (滿), and when the moon is full, it wanes (月滿則虧). Like the new moon (如月新) means not yet full (未滿), and what is not yet full will become full (未滿是盈)." The King became angry (怒) and killed (殺) the shamaness.

Also, in the Sabisu River (泗泚水), there was a dead fish (死魚) measuring three chang in length. Those who ate (食) it all died (死). Furthermore, the river water (江水) turned red (赤變), creating the appearance of blood (血象).<119>

**Summary**

This article recounts various supernatural omens and strange events said to have preceded the fall of the ancient Korean kingdom of Paekche, focusing on the reign of King Ŭija. These include an unusually large corpse, foxes invading the palace, a weeping tree, a prophetic ghost, a turtle shell inscribed with a cryptic message comparing Paekche to a waning moon and Silla to a waxing one, a giant poisonous fish, and the river turning blood-red. The story highlights the belief that cosmic signs foreshadow major historical shifts, specifically the downfall of a nation, and King Ŭija's fatal reaction to an unfavorable prophecy. From the perspective of Korean colonial history, this retelling of a traditional story in 1924 is interesting. It reflects a continued engagement with national history and folklore during a period of lost sovereignty, potentially serving as a subtle allegory or a source of historical reflection for Koreans living under Japanese rule, contemplating themes of destiny, decline, and perhaps the cyclical nature of power.
