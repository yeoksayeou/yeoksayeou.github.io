**Company Announcement**

Publication of the Kyŏnggi-do Issue

The Kyŏnggi-do issue, previously announced in the last issue as intended for publication as an enlarged issue on May 1st, has been changed. It will now be published as regular issues, dividing Kyŏngsŏng and the provinces separately. The provincial section will be published in the May issue, and the Kyŏngsŏng section will be published in the June issue; this revision has been decided.

**Summary**

This brief announcement informs readers of the magazine *Kaeppyŏk* about a change in publication plans for its special issue focusing on Kyŏnggi Province (Kyŏnggi-do). Originally planned as a single, enlarged issue for May 1st, it will now be split into two regular-sized issues: one covering the provincial areas in May and another covering the capital city, Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul), in June. For historians, this notice provides insight into the editorial decisions and potential production constraints faced by Korean magazines during the colonial period. The division between the capital (Kyŏngsŏng) and the rest of the province (地方) highlights the perceived distinction and perhaps the volume of content related to each, reflecting the capital's significance.
