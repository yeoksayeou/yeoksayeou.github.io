**Summary**

This article chronicles daily news events from February 21st to March 20th, 1924, covering both domestic Korean affairs and international developments. Key events within Korea include the trial of Ŭiyŏldan members, independence fighter activities and clashes with police, the establishment of youth and labor organizations (All-Chosŏn Youth Alliance, Labor-Farmer alliances), strikes by students and various workers (water merchants, locksmiths, fisheries, cotton ginners, rice selectors), the activities of the Korean Provisional Government in Shanghai, and actions by the Japanese colonial administration like appointing vice-consuls and suppressing dissent (confiscating Kaebyŏk, dispersing memorial services). Internationally, major developments include fluctuating Sino-Soviet and Russo-Japanese relations (negotiations, recognition, territorial disputes like the Chinese Eastern Railway and Outer Mongolia), political changes in Europe (Greek republic declared, cabinet changes, strikes), US immigration policy affecting Japanese, and various diplomatic maneuvers and conflicts involving major powers like Britain, France, Italy, Germany, and Turkey. From a Korean colonial history perspective, the article is significant for showcasing the persistent independence movement activities (Ŭiyŏldan, armed clashes, Provisional Government), the rise of organized social movements (labor, youth, Hyŏngp’yŏngsa linking with Japan's Levelers Association), and the everyday realities of colonial rule including suppression, economic grievances leading to strikes, and anti-Korean sentiment (assault by police in Ōsaka, Bishop Welch incident). It highlights the intertwining of local resistance and social change with broader international geopolitical tensions.
