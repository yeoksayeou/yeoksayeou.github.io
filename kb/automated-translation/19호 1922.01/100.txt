Attention Regarding Advertisements
When placing an order (注文) or making other inquiries (交涉) with advertisers after seeing an advertisement (廣告), please be sure to clearly state (明記) that you saw the advertisement in Gaebyeok.

**Summary**

This notice from the editors of Gaebyeok magazine provides guidelines for potential contributors, covering submission scope, writing style, deadlines, editorial rights, and the requirement for author identification even for anonymous submissions. It also instructs readers on how to interact with advertisers, advising them to mention Gaebyeok when contacting them and to save potentially useful advertisements for future reference. From a historical perspective, this piece offers insight into the practical operations of a major Korean magazine during the colonial period, including its editorial policies and its relationship with both writers and advertisers. The mention of a specific "contemporary mixed script style" (鮮演文交作時文軆) is particularly interesting for linguists and historians studying language standardization and usage, while the advice concerning advertisements highlights the commercial aspects and reader engagement strategies of the publication.
