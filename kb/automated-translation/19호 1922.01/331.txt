● A Respectful Notice to All Readers in Hamnam

One, Due to circumstances, Mr. Yu Pyŏngsŏn (劉炳璿), the Hamnam Branch Manager, has resigned. Mr. Ch'oe Kip'il (崔基弼) of Hamhŭng (咸興) has taken over those duties and assumed full responsibility for all matters before and after. Therefore, all persons who have recently had direct dealings with our Head Office (本社) should, from now on, direct magazine requests, payments, accounting, and all other interactions to the aforementioned Branch Office (右 支社).

One, It is said that a certain person (或人), claiming to be a Kaebyŏk reporter (開闢記者), has been appearing in the Hamnam region (咸南地方), soliciting advertisements celebrating the branch's development (支社發展 祝賀廣告) and New Year's greeting ads (新年 年賀廣告), and then pocketing the advertising fees (廣告料). Our Head Office (本社) is currently investigating this. Therefore, local personages (當地 人士) should first take caution and not be deceived (見欺치 말으시오) by such a person (one lacking credentials from our Head Office: 本社의 信憑이 無한 人).
