Looking at the World of Chinese Women and Seeing Our Own Women's World
						Ch'oe Tong'o

Before discussing the main issue, I would like to briefly state my overall impression of China in general.
The first time I went to China was ten years ago now—in February of the spring following the year the five-thousand-year-old great empire transformed into the fresh, young China, giving birth to the Republic of China. The sentiments and impressions that bound and were felt in my heart and mind in a foreign land where the language and customs were completely different were beyond counting. However, what gave me the deepest feeling in my heart and the greatest impression in my mind at that time was the old poem, "A lady of the Han palace today, tomorrow a concubine in the barbarian lands."

I read this old poem again and again. The dynasty of the Great Qing, which had wielded tiger-like authority for three hundred years, was overthrown, and the life of the Han people, who had shed blood and tears for three hundred years, was resurrected.
Ah—this seems to be my mistaken thought. The undertaking of the Republic of China—is not merely a matter of ethnic competition and dynastic overthrow. The five peoples—Han, Manchu, Mongol, Tibetan, and Qinghai—have united to become one people, and the territories of Manchuria, Mongolia, Qinghai, Tibet, and Han have united to become one family. From this point, my impressions underwent a turn. I thought that the small uniting to become large, the large uniting to become the great large, the future of the world would inevitably become one. To realize this principle of oneness, I later felt that the first urgent task was to sweep away all the stale relics of the past and globally propagate new ideals, new principles—specifically, humanism centered on us humans. This is my general impression from observing the superficial state of China as a whole. From here, I wish to enter the main topic.

I have usually heard and thought that among our human race, those who have the best fortune and spend a hundred years like a single day in idleness within embroidered, flowery curtains are Chinese women; and that among our human race, those who are the most pitiful and miserably spend a hundred years in suffering are also Chinese women.<57>
I am not inherently someone who particularly likes women. However, under the notion that among our human race, the best fortune belongs to those Chinese women, and the most pitiful also belong to those Chinese women, after going to China, regardless of North or South, wherever I went, I paid more attention to the women's world than to the men's society. I also compared it to our women's world. China's territory is originally too vast and its population too numerous, so the organization of society and the classes of humanity have also become extremely complex. It is ultimately impossible to see sufficiently with a short period and shallow insight. It is even more difficult for me, who has had little contact with the women's world. However, to state the current situation of the Chinese women's world as I saw it in one word, the Chinese women's world has been liberated and put in order to an extent that is truly surprising, beyond my imagination.

1. The Zeal for Learning in the Chinese Women's World

If one wishes to know about the zeal for learning in the Chinese women's world, one should first look at the expansion of educational institutions for Chinese women, namely girls' schools. Peking is the capital of China. However, in terms of the degree of cultural advancement and social development, it is a place with many inferior points compared to the South. Accordingly, there is naturally a marked difference in the spread and level of general education, and especially concerning the women's world, it was still a place where not leaving the inner chambers ("不出閨門") was considered a womanly virtue, yet female educational institutions amount to 30 percent of male educational institutions. Looking at the schools in Peking now, there are 7 universities, which are co-educational, and women make up about 30 percent. The total number of middle schools, high schools, and normal schools is over 80, while the number of girls' middle schools, high schools, and normal schools is 25 or 26. Seeing this alone, one can well understand the zeal for learning among women throughout China and the expansion of female educational institutions. Besides this, the number of female students in co-educational national primary schools is not significantly less than the number of male students. Originally, looking at the census data of various countries worldwide, women are generally fewer than men, and this is even more severe in China. Although it is somewhat difficult to state precise figures, it seems women likely do not exceed about 80 percent of the male population. Several years ago, I saw such news in Shanghai. This alone shows that the lack of development in Chinese female education in the past is an undeniable fact, and it is also a fact that the current zeal for learning in the Chinese women's world has become extremely high. Specifically, a news article reported under the headline "42-year-old woman petitions for admission to national primary school," quoting the elderly student's words (This era is a time when not only men but also women must learn, and one must learn not just at age 40, but even at 80. Old sayings mention 'forty-year-old composition' (四十 文章). Though I am now 42, from now on I intend to start learning anything.) <58> was published in a certain newspaper. After this news circulated widely, the zeal for learning among the general Chinese women's world became even more heightened. Besides this, I saw signs for Women's Art Schools everywhere, and I once received an invitation to and attended the 15th-anniversary art exhibition of a certain Women's Art School in Shanghai. At that time, the types of artworks arranged and displayed in the classrooms numbered over 3,000 items, and the total number of pieces was over 50,000. However, the majority were handicrafts by students currently enrolled in the first, second, third, and fourth years, and the rest were collected from other art schools.

As our society evolves and life improves, the desire for spiritual life—that is, the desire for an ideal life and an artistic life—increases more than the desire for physical life. Seeing the development and progress of artistic education and knowledge in the Chinese women's world like this, one can well understand the evolution of Chinese women's society and the standard of women's lives without needing further explanation. Thinking this way, the zeal for learning among Chinese women seems not merely a fashionable, blind, unconscious fervor, but rather passion and enthusiasm born from sufficient awareness.

2. Social Activities of the Chinese Women's World

Today, regardless of place or country, is a time when we shout with one voice for the issues of women's liberation and gender equality, and also an era when women's demands for absolute liberation and claims for equality intensify day by day. Thus, the issues of women's liberation and gender equality have become completely social and global issues.
Speaking of the Chinese women's world, they too had been shouting for this liberation and equality for several decades, putting forth effort and sacrifice. After the Xinhai Revolution occurred 11 years ago now, leading to the Republic of China, the momentum and fervor of this issue grew even stronger. Therefore, the sacrifice and activism for the nation and society by the women's patriotic army with cropped hair and the female student corps who joined the revolutionary army during that revolution mark the beginning of social activity in the Chinese women's world. Subsequently, the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China publicly recognized gender equality and even granted women suffrage. However, after the Northern Government was organized later, women's suffrage was again denied by law. At this time, public opinion in the Chinese women's world was momentarily extremely agitated. They engaged in much activity and effort, even sacrificing their lives. However, for Chinese women, whose solidarity was still weak and who had not yet achieved economic independence, it was ultimately impossible to achieve that goal at that time. Thus, the suffrage movement of the Chinese women's world ended in complete failure. From this point, the Chinese women's world <59> came to a great realization: no matter how much they shouted for and asserted this equality and liberation with broad theories and empty words, not only would they be unable to reach their goal, but there would also be no public benefit to society in general. Therefore, they concluded that the first plan was to actually and practically break free from dependent and constrained lives reliant on men and to pursue independent, self-reliant livelihoods, implementing practical enterprises in a way that did not lag behind men in reality and practice. From this point, for 10 years, the Chinese women's world strove and acted to realize practical enterprises in order to achieve the principle of independent livelihood. To achieve and realize this principle of independent livelihood and practical enterprises, it is first necessary to have the corresponding knowledge. To disseminate this principle and knowledge throughout the general women's world, on the one hand, they established Women's Vocational Schools in various places to cultivate talent, and on the other hand, they organized Women's Industrial Associations and published daily and monthly newspapers to promote and awaken the general female society to the necessity of these practical enterprises and the idea of independent livelihood. Due to this, the social solidarity of the Chinese women's world has now become solid, and they have nearly reached the point of practicing the principle of independent livelihood. Listing the social and economic organizations of the Chinese women's world now, they are roughly as follows: There are many organizations such as the various local Women Students' Associations aimed at knowledge exchange and mutual friendship among students; the National Federation of Women Students' Associations aimed at exchanging ideas and fostering connection and affection among students from over 20 provinces of China; the Girl Guides aimed at correcting the general customs of women's society and promoting equality between male and female society; and groups like the Women's Alliance Corps, who cut their hair and pledged to sacrifice themselves for national affairs and contribute themselves to society. Also, in large and small cities, one can see many Women's Weaving Factories, Women's Hosiery Factories, Women's Trading Companies, Women's Shops, etc. Not only this, but one can also see many female clerks in various companies, banks, and shops. Furthermore, last summer in Shanghai, I saw such an event, and this autumn in Peking, I saw another such event. Last spring, the drought in Shantung and Chihli was so severe that crops could not even sprout out of the ground. Because of this, the number of famine victims in Shantung and Chihli exceeded 30 million. The fact that relief efforts were made by the government, various organizations, and even foreign governments is likely still fresh in the readers' memory. At that time, while wealthy individuals in general society, public organizations, the government, and foreign governments, having considerable financial resources and budgets, seemed intent on trading small acts of charity for large gains, the students, especially female students who had not yet achieved economic independence, could not suppress or restrain their warm sympathy for mutual aid in hardship and the tears of sympathy welling up from their pure hearts. I saw female students and Girl Guides <60> pouring out their passion for a month, continuing day and night activities like theatrical performances, dances—with tears and sweat—and fundraising processions—with sweat and effort—to rescue their compatriots in hardship. This summer, an unprecedented flood occurred in Kiangsu and the Yanghu region (Hunan and Hupei). This flood was caused by the collapse of the upper reaches of the Yellow River due to heavy rains, creating a sea of floodwater stretching several thousand li in length and 400-500 li, even up to 600-700 li, in width. According to the relief society's investigation, the number of affected households was over 30,000, and the affected population was over 200,000. In the case of Hupei, consecutive years of military conflict in Wuch'ang and Ich'ang were compounded, like frost added to snow, by such an unprecedented flood. Witnessing such events, who could not shed tears of sympathy? While there were many efforts and activities from all sectors across the country to provide relief, the impact of the activities of the women's world was also immense. Braving the autumn sun's glare, events like dance performances and martial arts demonstrations were hosted by female students for a week at Peking's Central Park (社稷壇 - Altar of Land and Grain), held twice daily, day and night. They received much enthusiastic support from the general public, and the collected sum of over 30,000 yuan was sent to the relief society to aid the disaster victims. Synthesizing these events, it appears that the Chinese women's world has reached a point where, in reality and practice, their efforts and activities for the public good of society and the nation do not lag behind men, and all practical, profit-oriented enterprises have also, in reality and practice, reached a point where they do not fall behind men. Therefore, Chinese men can no longer dare to restrain or discriminate against women as they did in the past. This year, I saw another statement in a Chinese newspaper. Under the headline "A Certain Woman Scholar's Talk," it mentioned that to thoroughly achieve the goals of gender equality and women's liberation, it is first necessary to promote the principle of monogamy. It reported a "Divorce Alliance Theory" (離妻同盟說) in a certain newspaper, stating that if men do not readily agree to the movement to abolish "yítàitai" (姨太太 - our word for concubine), then we women have resolved to form a divorce alliance altogether. As the strength and activity of the Chinese women's world thus gradually gain power, the issue of Chinese women's suffrage has recently resurfaced. Consequently, it is said that the constitution of the Southern Federated Provincial Government of China has again publicly recognized women's suffrage. Due to this, not only are there numerous women with voting rights, but I heard that there are 2 or 3 female parliamentarians elected and attending the Southern National Assembly. Thinking this way, the liberation and equality of Chinese women are not just theoretical issues but are gradually becoming matters of fact.

In a transitional period, women of any country might have suffered limitless restrictions and discriminatory treatment from men, but it seems particularly severe for Chinese women. Confined within oppressive inner chambers like prisons unable to see the light of day, though not naturally disabled, they were made into cripples (纏足 - foot-binding) artificially <61>, spending their entire lives meaninglessly in miserable bondage and limitless suffering, unable to experience even a moment of enjoyable life. For those Chinese women to have passed through such a journey and reached the current state is truly something that cannot but surprise us beyond our imagination. The liberation through the development of women's rights and the orderliness through the evolution of women's society are truly beyond our expectations. I not only praise the current state of the Chinese women's world but also congratulate the abundant spirit of future development. In this era where the common global catchphrase is "Civilization is a synonym for luxury," seeing those women, who have a nature particularly prone to splendor and vanity, wearing clothes made of domestically produced plain cotton cloth, with elegant and pure natural makeup, carrying book bags, briskly commuting to school morning and evening, cheerfully exercising on sports fields, and engaging in activities for all public benefits of the nation and society as mentioned before—it truly seems that the hope for the future development of the Chinese women's world is abundant.

While observing and congratulating the Chinese women's world in this manner, I repeatedly thought of our country's women's world.
1. What is the state of the zeal for learning in our women's world?
2. What is the state of artistic education and knowledge in our women's world?
3. What is the state of social activity in our women's world?
4. What is the state of independent livelihood, that is, realistic enterprises manifested through practicalism, in our women's world?
5. Are there public benefit projects mainly led by our women's world?
6. What is the state of frugality, liveliness, and future potential in our women's world?

As I wrote down these few questions about our women's world, I thought this way: Isn't this the same kind of thinking I previously had when imagining the Chinese women's world? Today, various aspects of our society are evolving at a pace where one year is like ten, and ten years are like a hundred. It has been exactly ten years since I left Kyŏngsŏng, and now I have come back to Kyŏngsŏng. Ah, the proverb says, "Mountains and rivers change in ten years," and it seems truly so. Roads, houses, shops, newspaper offices, schools, etc.—overall, it seems completely unlike the Kyŏngsŏng I saw ten years ago. Amidst such significant changes in the general state of society, the women's world seems to have developed even more remarkably. Women walking around wearing conical hats on clear days or long outer garments (長衣) are completely unseen; one only sees female students carrying book bags and commuting to school morning and evening. Thus, in our women's world too, although political equality has not yet been achieved, social liberation—that is, equality—seems to have been attained. One day, while strolling with two or three friends, I saw a sign reading "Women's Shop" (女子商店) in Chŏndong and another reading "Women's Association Store" (婦人商會) on Chongno. With great delight, wanting to find out more about their details, I went into the place called Women's Association Store with the friends I was with and bought one or two small items. In this way, I observed the details carefully. The arrangement and tidiness of the goods and the kindness and attentiveness of the staff were truly commendable and astonishing. As I came out of the store, I said to the friend I was with, "There is considerable awareness and hope in our country's women's world," to which the friend replied, "Not only this, but in recent years, there have been Women's Lecture Troupes and Opera Companies in various places. Regardless of whether in the capital or the countryside, wherever they went, they performed edifying fervent speeches and cautionary passionate performances, giving not only great awareness and fruitful results to the women's world but also providing considerable benefit and light to Korean society in general." Hearing this, I was once again deeply moved. <62>

**Summary**

The author, Ch'oe Tong'o, reflects on his observations of Chinese women's progress a decade after the 1911 revolution. He contrasts their past suffering (foot-binding, confinement) with their current strides in education (high enrollment, art schools), social activism (participation in revolution, suffrage movements, relief work), and economic independence (vocational schools, women-run businesses). He admires their growing solidarity, practical focus, and simple lifestyle. Returning to Korea (Kyŏngsŏng) after ten years, he notes significant societal changes and observes parallel progress among Korean women, citing increased school attendance, the emergence of women-owned shops, and cultural activities like lecture troupes, concluding with renewed hope for Korean women's future. From a historical perspective, the article is interesting for its transnational comparison between post-revolutionary China and colonial Korea, highlighting shared aspirations for women's rights and modernization. It provides a contemporary Korean intellectual's view on female liberation, linking education, economic self-sufficiency, and social participation as key components, reflecting the broader discourse on social change under colonial constraints.

中國女子界를 보고 우리 女子界를 봄
						崔東旿
나는 이제 本 問題를 말하기 前에 中國 一般에 對한 나의 總感想을 한 마디로 말하고 십다.
내가 第 一次로 中國에 가던 때는 距今 十年 前― 五千年 老大帝國이 新鮮한 少年 中國으로 化하야 中華民國이 産出되던 翌年 春 2月일다. 말과 風俗이 아조 달은 異國 他鄕에 나의 胸中과 腦筋에 繃結되며 느끼던 모든 懷抱와 感想은 한아 둘로 다 말할 수 업섯다. 그러나 그 때에 나의 가삼에 가장 깁흔 느낌과 나의 腦 속에 가장 큰 印象을 줄 것은 「今日漢宮人으로 明朝胡地妾」이란 古詩일다.
나는 이 古詩를 再三 읽엇다. 三百年 虎威를 施하던 大淸의 社稷은 壓倒되고 三百年 血淚를 流하던 漢族의 生命은 復活일다.
아― 이것이 나의 잘못 생각인 듯하다. 中華民國의― 事業은 種族 競爭과 社稷顚覆의 일만은 안이다. 漢·滿·蒙·藏·靑의 5族은 合하야 一族이 되고 滿·蒙·靑·藏·漢의 疆域은 合하야 一家가 되얏다. 이로부터 나의 感想은 한번 轉輪이 되얏다. 小한 것이 合하야 大로 大한 것이 合하야 大의 大로 世界의 將來는 一이 되고야 마르리라고 思하얏다. 이 一의 主義를 實現하랴면 過去의 모든 陳腐한 遺物을 一刷하고 新理想 新主義 곳 우리 사람을 本位로 한 人本主義를 世界的으로 宣傳함이 第一 急務이란 感想을 나종에 가젓섯다. 이것은 中國 全體의 表面積 現狀을 보고 느낀 나의 總感想일다. 이로부터 本 問題에 들어가고저 한다.
내가 平日에 듯고 생각하기를 우리 人類中 第一 八字 조코 안일하게 百年을 하로가티 錦繡花帳 裡에서 지내는 者는 中國 女子요 우리 人類 中 第一 불상하고 悲慘하게 百年을 苦痛으로 지내는 者도 또한 中國 女子라 하얏다.＜57＞
나는 本是 女性을 그다지 조와 하는 무엇은 아니다. 그러나 우리 人類 中 第一 八字 조키로도 뎌 中國 女子요 第一 불상하기로도 뎌 中國 女子란 觀念 下에서 中國에 간 後로 南이나 北을 勿論하고 간 곳마다 男子 社會 보담 女子界를 만이 注意하야 보앗다. 또한 우리 女子界에 比較도 하야 보앗다. 中國은 原來 너무나 地域이 廣大하며 人民이 衆多함으로 社會의 組織과 人類의 階級이 또한 甚히 複雜하게 되얏다. 短縮한 時日과 여튼 眼目으로는 到底히 充分히 보기는 不能하다. 더욱 女子界에 接觸에 적은 나로는 一層 어렵다. 그러나 나의 본 대로 中國 女子界의 現狀을 한 말로써 말삼할진대 中國 女子界는 實로 나의 想像 밧게 놀날만치 解放되얏스며 整頓되얏다.

1. 中國 女子界의 向學熱

中國 女子界의 向學熱의 어떠한 것을 알고저 할진대 먼저 中國 女子의 敎育機關인 女學校의 擴張됨을 볼지라. 北京은 中國의 首都이라. 그러나 文化의 向上 程度와 社會의 發達 程度로 말하면 南方에 比하야 만은 遜色이 잇는 곳이다. 이를 딸아 一般的 敎育의 普及과 程度도 自然 顯著한 差異가 잇는 바 더욱 女子界로 말하면 아직도 「不出閨門」으로 女德을 삼는 곳이엇마는 女子 敎育機關이 男子 敎育機關의 3割은 된다. 이제 北京잇는 學校를 들어 말하면 大學校가 7인대 이는 男女同學인 바 女子가 3割은 되고 中學, 高等, 師範學校 總 數가 80餘 個所인대 女子 中學, 高等, 師範學校 數가 25,6個所이라. 이것만 보아도 中華 全國에 女子의 向學熱이 엇더한 것과 女子 敎育機關의 擴張됨을 可히 알아 볼 수 잇다. 이 밧게도 男女同校인 國民小學校의 女學生 數는 男學生 數 보담 그다지 少數가 아니다. 原來 世界 各國의 人口調査表를 보건대 大槪는 男子보담 女子가 少數인 바 中國은 더욱 甚하야 明確한 數字를 表하기는 좀 困難하지마는 아마 女子가 男子에 對한 8割 假量에서는 더 안이되는 듯하다. 나는 몃 해 前에 上海에서 이런 新聞을 보앗다. 이것 한아만 보아도 過去에 中國 女子 敎育이 發達되지 못함도 可히 隱諱할 수 업는 事實이요 現在 中國 女子界의 向學熱이 또한 非常히 놉하짐도 事實이라. 即 42歲인 老婆가 國民小學校에 入學 請願을 하얏다는 題目下에 그 老學生의 말(只今 이 時代는 男子만 배울 것이 아니라 女子도 배워야 할 때요 또한 나히 40은 고사하고 80이라도 배워야 할 것이라. 녯 사람 말에 四十 文章이 잇섯다 하얏스니 내가 只今 42歲이지마는 이제부터는 무엇이던지 배우기를 시작하려 하오.)을 ＜58＞ 어떤 新聞에 記載하얏더라. 이 新聞이 한 번 各地에 돈 後로 中國 一般 女子界의 向學熱은 더욱 한層 激昻하야 젓다. 이밧게 나는 곳곳마다 女子美術學校란 看板을 보앗스며 上海 어떤 女子 美術學校 創立 15年紀念 美術品展覽會의 請單을 바다 갓던 일이 잇다. 當時 敎室內에 分排 羅列한 美術 品種別은 3千餘 件이요 總枚數는 五萬餘 幅이러라. 그런대 이것은 一二三四學年의 在學生 手工品이 大部分이요 그 담에는 다른 곳 美術學校에서 募集하야 온 것이더라.
우리 人生은 이 社會가 進化할사록 生活이 向上할사록 肉的 生活의 慾望보다는 精的 生活 곳 理想的 生活과 美術的 生活의 慾望이 向上되는 것이다. 이제 中國 女子界에 美術的 敎育과 美術的 知識이 이러탓이 發達되며 進步됨을 보면 中國 女子 社會의 進化와 女子 生活의 程度를 말 아니 하고도 가히 알 만하다. 이리 생각하야 보면 中國 女子의 向學熱은 다만 行勢的으로 盲目的으로 無意識的 熱狂이 아니요 充分한 覺悟下에서 생긴 熱情과 熱心인 듯하다.

2. 中國女子界의 社會的 活動

오늘은 어떤 곳, 어떤 나라를 勿論하고 女子解放과 男女平等의 問題를 우리가 萬口同聲으로 絶呌하는 이 때이요, 또한 女子側에서 絶對解放을 要求함과 平等을 主張함이 日復日激昻하는 이 時代일다. 이리하야 이 女子解放과 男女平等의 問題는 社會的으로 世界的으로 아조 化하는 問題일다.
中國女子界로 말하야도 이 解放과 平等을 爲하야 勞力과 犧牲을 다하야 가면서 數十年來-絶呌하야오던 바 距今 11年前, 壬子革命이 起하야 中華民國이 된 後로 이 問題는 더욱 聲勢가 놉하지며 氣焰이 커젓다. 이럼으로 그 革命 當時에 革命軍에 加入한 머리깍근 女子愛國軍과 女學生隊의 國家와 社會를 爲하야 犧牲하며 活動한 것은 中國女子界의 처음 社會的으로 活動한 것이다. 그 後 中華民國臨時約法에는 男女平等을 公認하고 女子에게 參政權을 許與한 事實까지 잇섯다. 그러나 其後 北方政府가 組織되자 다시 法律로 女子參政權을 否認하얏다. 이 때에 中國女子界의 輿論은 一時 甚히 激憤되얏섯다. 生命을 犧牲하야가면서 만은 活動과 勞力을 하얏다. 그러나 그때까지 團結力이 薄弱한 中國 女子로 아즉 生活獨立을 못한 中國女子로 그 때 그 目的을 貫徹하기는 到底 不可能의 事일다. 이에 中國女子界의 參政權運動은 아조 失敗하고 말앗다. 이로부터 中國女子界는＜59＞ 크게 覺悟하기를 廣博한 理論과 虛浮한 말로마는 아모리 이 平等과 解放을 絶呌하며 主張할지라도 그 目的을 到達하기 不能할 뿐 아니라 또한 一般 社會에 公益될 것이 업다. 이로부터 事實上 實際的으로 男子에 對한 依賴와 束縛的 生活을 벗고 獨立自主의 生計를 하도록 實利的 事業을 事實上 實際的으로 男子에게 뒤지지 아니하도록 實行함이 第一計라 하얏다. 이로부터 中國 女子界는 10年間- 獨立生計의 主義를 貫徹하려고 實利的 事業을 實現하기에 勞力하며 活動하얏다. 이 獨立生計의 主義와 實利的 事業을 貫徹하며 實現하랴면 먼저 이에 應하는 知識이 업스면 不可하다. 이 主義와 知識을 一般 女子界에 普及케하기 爲하야 一方, 女子實業學校를 各地에 設立하야 人才를 養成하며 一方, 女子實業會를 組織하고 日刊 月刊의 報紙를 發行하야 一般女子社會에 이 實利的 事業의 必要와 獨立生計의 思想을 鼓吹하며 警醒하얏다. 이로 因하야 現今 中國女子界는 社會的 團結力이 鞏固하야 젓스며 獨立生計의 主義를 거의 實踐하리만치 되엇다. 이제 中國女子界의 社交的 團體와 經濟的 團體를 들어 말할진대 大略 이러하다. 各地 各 學生이 學生間 서로 知識 交換과 親睦相愛를 目的한 各地 女學生會와 中國 20餘 省의 學生間 서로 意思交換과 聯絡相愛를 目的한 全國女學生聯合會와 女子社會의 一般 風氣를 矯正하며 男女社會의 平等性을 助長하기로 目的한 女童子軍과 國事에 몸을 犧牲하려 社會에 몸을 貢獻하려 머릿깍고 同盟한 女子同盟團 가튼 團體가 만히 잇스며 또한 大小 各 都會에 女子組織工場, 女子襪廠, 女子商會, 女子商店 等을 만히 볼 수 잇다. 이 뿐만 아니라 各 社會, 銀杏, 商店, 女子事務員이 만히 잇슴도 볼 수 잇다. 나는 또한 昨年 여름에는 上海에서 이런 일을 보앗고 今年 가을에는 北京에서 이런 일을 보앗다. 昨年 봄에는 山東, 直隷에 旱災가 甚하야 아조 穀物의 發芽가 땅 밧게 나 보지도 못할 만치 旱災가 들엇다. 이럼으로 山東直隷외 饑民은 근 3千萬 以上이엇다. 政府로 各 團體로, 外國政府로부터 까지 그 饑民救濟가 잇슨 事實은 讀者- 諸位께서도 記憶이 尙新하실 줄 밋는 바 그 當時에 一般社會의 財産家와 公共團體와 政府 밋 外國政府로는 다 相當한 財力과 豫算이 잇슴으로 적은 仁을 팔아 큰 利를 어드려 함인 듯하나 아즉 生計獨立을 못한 學生, 더구나 女學生의 그 患難相救의 따뜻한 同情과 그 天眞의 솟아나는 同情의 熱淚를 抑制하고 禁하다 못하야 演劇, 舞蹈의 눈물과 땀 行巡募損의 땀물과 힘으로 同胞의 患難을 相救하려 ＜60＞ 熱情을 다하야 一個月間이나 晝夜로 繼續 活動하는 女學生, 女童子軍을 보앗스며, 今年 여름에는 江蘇 兩湖에 近年罕有의 水災가 또한 生하얏다. 이 水災는 潦漲으로 黃河 上流가 崩決되어 長이 數千里- 廣이 4, 5百里로 乃至 6, 7百里를 貫通하야 洪水의 바다가 되엇다. 救濟會 調査에 依하면 罹災戶數가 3萬餘戶요 罹災人口는 20萬 以上이라 하얏더라. 湖北으로 말하면 兩年내에 武昌, 宜昌의 兵禍가 有한 同時에 雪上加霜으로 이런 罕有의 水災까지 잇섯다. 이런 일을 볼 때에 뉘던지 同情의 눈물을 아니 흘리 수 업다. 全國 各 方面의 活動으로 이를 救濟하기 爲하야 勞力 活動한 일도 만커니와 女子界의 活動한 效果가 또한 多大하얏다. 그 秋天의 曝陽을 무릅쓰고 舞蹈會, 拳術會 等을 北京 中央公園 社稷壇에서 1週 동안을 女學生의 主催로 晝夜 2回式 開演하야 一般 社會의 만흔 熱情도 바닷고 그 收入된 3萬餘圓의 金額은 救濟會에 보내여 그 災民을 救恤케 하얏다. 이런 일을 綜合하야 볼진댄 中國女子界에서 事實上 實際的으로 一般 社會와 國家의 公益을 爲하야 勞力하며 活動함에 實로 男子에게 뒤지지 아니하리 만치 되엇스며, 實利主義의 모든 事業도 事實上 實際的으로 또한 男子에게 落後되지 아니할 만치 되엇다. 이럼으로 中國의 男子는 女子를 前日과 가티 敢히 束縛하려, 敢히 差別視 하려 못한다. 나는 今年에 中國 어떤 新聞에서 또 이런 말을 보앗다. 某女史의 談이란 題目下에 우리가 男女平等, 女子解放의 目的을 徹底히 到達하랴면 먼저 一夫一妻主義를 宣傳함이 必要하다. 一夫一妻 곳, 姨太太(姨太太는 우리말에 妾이란 말) 廢止運動을 하야 男子側에서 容易히 同意하지 아니하면 우리 女子는 一切로 離妻同盟을 하기로 決心하얏다는 離妻同盟說이 某新聞에 揭載됨을 보앗다. 이러하게 中國 女子界의 實力과 活動이 漸漸 힘잇게 됨을 딸아 近來에 中國 女子 參政權 問題는 다시 再起하얏다. 그럼으로 中國南方聯省政府憲法에는 女子參政權을 다시 公認하얏다 한다. 이로 因하야 選擧權을 가진者는 勿論 多數어니와 選擧에 當選되어 南方國會에 出席한 女議員이 2, 3人이란 말을 들엇다. 이리 생각하야 보면 中國 女子의 解放과 平等은 理論的 問題 뿐이 아니라 漸漸 事實 問題로 化하야 갓다.
過渡時代에 在하야 어떤 나라 어떤 女子가 男子에게 無限한 束縛과 差別的 對偶를 밧지 아니 하얏스리요마는 더욱 中國女子가 甚한 듯하다. 天日을 못보는 牢獄가튼 閨門안에서 天然의 不具者는 아니언마는 人爲的으로 ＜61＞ 발병신(纏足)不具者가 되어 悲慘한 束縛과 無限한 苦痛으로 한 平生을 뜻업시 보내며 1時도 趣味잇는 生活을 못하던 뎌 中國女子로 뎌만한 路程을 經過하야 이만한 現狀에 이르게 됨은 참말 우리의 想像밧게 놀날만한 일이라 아니할 수 업다. 女權의 發達로 解放됨과 女社會의 進化로 整頓됨이 實로 우리의 뜻밧기다. 나는 이제 中國女子界의 現狀을 贊할 뿐 아니라 더욱 將來 發展의 氣分이 만음을 賀한다. 只今 世界에 共通的 流行語인 「文明은 奢侈의 代名詞」란 이 時代에 더욱 華麗浮虛의 性이 만은 뎌 女子로 自國産인 純布木의 衣服과 端雅潔白의 天演的 化粧으로 冊褓안코 아츰 저녁으로 活潑하게 通學하는 것과 快活하게 運動場에서 運動하는 것과 國家와 社會의 모든 公益을 爲하야 前에 말함과 가티 活動하는 것을 볼진대 참으로 中國 女子界의 將來 發展의 希望이 만아 보인다.
나는 中國女子界를 이러하게 보고 贊賀할 때에 우리나라 女子界를 再三 聯想하얏다.
1, 우리 女子界의 向學熱은 어떠한가?
2, 우리 女子界의 美術的 敎育과 知識은 어떠한가?
3, 우리 女子界의 社會的 活動은 어떠한가?
4, 우리 女子界의 獨立生計 곳 實利主義로 나타내는 現實的 事業은 어떠한가?
5, 우리 女子界가 主로된 公益事業이 잇는가?
6, 우리 女子界의 儉素性, 活潑性, 將來性은 어떠한가?
나는 우리 女子界에 對하야 몃가지 疑詞를 쓰다가 이리 생각하얏다. 이것이 내가 前日에 中國女子界를 想像하던 생각과 가튼 생각이 아닌가 하얏다. 오늘 우리 社會의 各 方面은 1年이 10年, 10年이 100年가티 長足의 勢로 進化되는 이 때이라 내가 京城을 떠난 지 이제부터 만 10年만에 다시 京城에를 왓다. 아 俗談에 10年이면 江山이 變한다더니, 참말인 듯하다. 道路, 家屋, 商店, 報館, 學校 等 全般을 通하야 아조 10年前 내가 보던 京城은 아닌 듯하다. 이와가티 一般 社會의 現狀이 크게 變動이 된 가운대 더욱 女子界가 尤一層 發達된 듯하다. 개인날 삿갓 쓰고, 長衣 쓴 行動的 女子는 아조 볼 수 업고 冊褓안고 아츰 저녁으로 學校에 通學하는 女學生을 볼 뿐일다. 이리하야 우리 女子界에서도 아즉 政治上 平等은 못 되엇스나  社會上 解放 곳 平等은 된 듯하다. 나는 어느날 親舊 2, 3人으로 더부러 散步를 나갓다가 典洞에서 女子商店이란 看板과 鍾路에서 婦人商會란 看板을 보앗다. 나는 하도 깃븐 생각으로 그 內容까지 좀 仔細하게 알아보고저 하야 가티 갓던 親舊로 더부러 어떤 婦人商會란 대를 들어가 한두가지 細小한 物品을 삿다. 이리하야 그 內容을 仔細 仔細히 觀察하얏다. 物品의 配列整頓과 店員의 親切丁寧은 참말 驚賀할만하다. 나는 商會門을 나오면서 가티 갓던 親舊에게 對하야 「우리나라 女子界에도 覺悟와 希望이 적지 아니하오」 한 즉 그 親舊의 對答하는 말이 이 뿐 아니라 近來 數年에는 各地에 女子 講演隊와 歌劇會가 잇서서 京鄕을 勿論하고 간 곳마다 利世的 熱辯과 警世的 熱情을 演出하야 다만, 女子界에만 큰 覺悟와 美果를 줄 뿐 아니라, 一般 朝鮮社會에 적지 아니한 利益과 光明을 주엇다」함을 듯고 나는 또 한 번 크게 느꼇다. ＜62＞
