金亨湖壽宴帖
全州 李載克 誌
The venerable gentleman's name is Ha Du, courtesy name Hyŏngho. He resides in Kangdong, Ulsan. In the year Ŭlmyo (likely 1855 or 1915, context suggests older), twelfth month, on an inauspicious day (孤辰, *kojin* - lit. solitary day, an astrological term), it happened to be his birthday (會經?). Having retired from a position as *Ch'imnang* (寢郞 - likely a minor court attendant role), he lives in seclusion, engaging in fishing and woodcutting, enjoying books day and night. He has six sons and thirteen grandchildren. The husband and wife are still harmonious like the *kŏmungo* and *pip'a* (琴瑟). It can be said he enjoys the rewards of good fortune and virtue.

全州 李埼鎔
The morning sun on this twelfth-month dawn seems like that of years past,
The Jade Bureau Immortal (玉局仙人) attests to the old affinity.
His late-life plan for fishing and woodcutting has found its place,
His advanced age and rank truly come from Heaven.
His great ambition symbolized by mulberry and catalpa bows persists without end,
Yet the remaining feelings stirred by the wind in the trees are truly poignant.
White-haired, joyous, his body is even healthier,
The zither on the stand and colorful robes in the courtyard alternate amidst the feast.

雲養 金允植
An enlightened person's years originally began at birth,
Ten thousand kalpas pass in a flash, an endless connection.
His initial aspiration with the mulberry bow fulfilled in his later years,
Retiring from the *Ch'imnang* role, he is covered by Heaven's benevolence.
His sons and grandsons can be called flourishing,
Husband and wife have always been harmonious.
Don't ask the price of rice in Kangdong,
Just brew a thousand *hok* (斛 - a large measure) and enjoy this feast!

全州 李載德
The wise man, blessed with much fortune, enjoys this year,
His temple hair long and fine, a connection beyond this world.
Making his home near the sea, a land of surplus blessings,
Having served in office when the time was right, under a benevolent Heaven.
From now on, those who know of his virtuous retreat will be few,
Remembering his past labors makes one doubly wistful.
Filling the cups with flowing rosy wine for guests and host,
I am ashamed that my own trifling duties prevent me from attending the feast.

梅下 崔永年
The recluse scholar of the Eastern province is praised by the world as worthy,
Taking the Two Elders (二老 - perhaps referring to revered figures or ideals) as his teacher, hidden by the sea.
A single decree sealed with purple clay (紫泥) brought the rain and dew of favor,
His mastery of the Six Scripts (六書) flows like colorful clouds and smoke (彩筆落雲烟).
His enduring youthfulness has the spirit of fragrant orchids flourishing,
The stars of longevity shine together over the guests and the婺 star (associated with women/wives).
Heaven does not ordinarily give birth to such an old gentleman,
Surely bestowing future prosperity and granting him peaceful later years. <72>

**Summary**

This article is a collection of congratulatory poems (壽宴帖, *suyŏnch'ŏp*) written by several literati (Yi Chaekŭk, Yi Kiyong, Kim Yunsik, Yi Chaedŏk, Ch'oe Yŏngnyŏn) for the birthday celebration of Kim Hyŏngho (courtesy name of Kim Hadu) of Kangdong, Ulsan, published in the magazine *Kaebyŏk* in 1922. The poems praise Kim Hyŏngho's long life, virtuous character, past minor official service (*Ch'imnang*), happy retirement enjoying nature and books, harmonious marriage, and prosperous family with many sons and grandsons. They employ traditional imagery associated with longevity, scholarly pursuits, and virtuous retirement. From a historical perspective, this piece is interesting as it showcases the persistence of traditional literati culture, including the composition of Hanmun poetry and celebratory practices like the *suyŏn*, among the Korean elite during the Japanese colonial period. The publication in *Kaebyŏk*, a prominent intellectual magazine often associated with modernizing and nationalist trends, highlights the complex cultural milieu where traditional forms coexisted with new movements. The names involved, like Kim Yunsik (a significant late Chosŏn/early colonial period figure), also point to the continued social standing of this class.
