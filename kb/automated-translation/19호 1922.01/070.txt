愛惡箴
						李達衷

有非子 (Yubija) visited 無是翁 (Musiong) and said, "Recently, there was a group discussing people's character. Some people affirmed you, Old Sir, while others negated you. Why is it that some people regard you as a proper person, while others do not?"

The Old Sir heard this and explained, saying, "If people approve of me, I am not necessarily pleased; if people disapprove of me, I am not necessarily afraid. It is not simply about whether they approve or disapprove of me. Moreover, I do not yet know what kind of person the one who approves of me is, nor what kind of person the one who disapproves of me is. If a worthy person approves of me, then it is indeed cause for joy. If an unworthy person disapproves of me, then that too is indeed cause for joy. If a worthy person disapproves of me, then it is indeed cause for concern. If an unworthy person approves of me, then that too is indeed cause for concern. Whether joyful or concerned, one must carefully examine whether the person who approves or disapproves of me is a worthy person or not. Therefore, it is said: 'Only the benevolent person (仁人) is able truly to love people and truly to hate people.' Is the person who approves of me a benevolent person? Is the person who disapproves of me a benevolent person?"

Yubija smiled and withdrew. Musiong then composed a maxim (箴) to admonish himself. The maxim reads:

"The beauty of Chado (子都), who would deem it not beautiful?
What Yi A (易牙) seasoned, who would deem it not delicious?
Likes and dislikes are multifarious and confused;
Why not seek the standard within oneself?" <40>

**Summary**

This philosophical piece, presented as a dialogue and a concluding maxim, argues that one should not simply react to praise or criticism from others. Instead, one must judge the character of the person offering the judgment. Approval from a worthy person (仁人) is good, and disapproval from an unworthy person is also good; conversely, disapproval from a worthy person or approval from an unworthy person are causes for concern. Referencing historical figures known for objective beauty (Chado) and taste (Yi A), the maxim concludes that subjective likes and dislikes are confusing, and the ultimate standard should be sought within oneself. From the perspective of Korean colonial history, this article, published in the influential magazine *Kaebyŏk*, is interesting as it uses traditional East Asian philosophical language (Hanmun style, Confucian quotes, classical allusions) to discuss personal ethics and self-cultivation. Historians might see this emphasis on inner moral judgment and self-reflection ("求諸己") as a subtle response by intellectuals seeking moral grounding and integrity amidst the political and social complexities of the colonial era.
