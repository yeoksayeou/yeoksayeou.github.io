Discussing the Side Businesses Necessary for Our Farming Households
						By Yi Sŏnghwan in Kyoto

Our farmers number over 13,900,000, accounting for more than 80% of our total population. Truly, they belong to the precious class that forms the backbone of Chosŏn. Consequently, the poverty or wealth of the farmers and the decline or prosperity of agriculture directly or indirectly exert an extremely significant influence on the social lifeblood of Chosŏn, leaving no room for our superfluous words.

However, observing the actual state of life of our farmers in recent times, due to the influx of contemporary trends and the development of the latest culture, their standard of living is rapidly improving and advancing at an astonishingly swift pace, making it difficult to enumerate every instance. To discuss a few examples: regarding the three necessities of clothing, food, and shelter, clothing has changed from coarse hemp clothes to cotton clothes, cotton clothes to cotton-silk blends (綿紬), cotton-silk blends to Western wool gauze (洋毛紗), with Western clothing becoming fashionable. Dietary habits have changed from uncleanliness to prioritizing cleanliness suitable for daily hygiene. Housing has transitioned from thatched houses to tile-roofed houses (瓦家), and from single-story to multi-story, two-story structures. Not only this, but the traditional hat (冠網) that was satisfactory for about 1 wŏn in the past has now advanced to fedoras (中折帽), bowler hats (中山帽), straw boaters (麥幹帽), or yin-yang gauze hats (陰陽紗笠) costing over five times as much. Past straw shoes (草履) have now transformed into Western-style shoes (洋式 구두). Along with the changing times, the standard of living, not yielding a single step, is improving to the highest degree. On the other hand, national expenditures are manifold, tax levies and collections increase year by year, the thirst for knowledge among school-age children is surging tenfold compared to before, consequently making educational expenses inevitably increase day by day and month by month. Furthermore, children of farming families, intoxicated by the new trends, have fled far from the villages and concentrated in urban centers like Kyŏngsŏng, P'yŏngyang, etc. In other words, it is because these turncoats (變節漢) from farming households have developed a desire for knowledge. Facing such times, if farmers do not devise some method of self-defense or emergency relief, they will inevitably fall into the tragic circumstance of being unable to stand in this world as farmers. Then, what are these emergency relief and self-defense methods? They are to increase the wealth (富力) of the farming household itself and to cultivate (涵養) the capital resources (資力) of the farming household itself. To increase this wealth and cultivate these capital resources, alongside the traditional main grain agriculture of rice, barley, cereals, etc., one must engage in side businesses (副業) that have a close, interdependent relationship like lips and teeth to a cart <113> – such as sericulture (養蠶), animal husbandry (養畜), beekeeping (養蜂), fish farming (養魚), or the manufacturing of agricultural, forestry, and marine products (農産, 林産, 水産製造), and the cultivation of vegetables (蔬菜) and fruit trees (果樹栽培). This is so that the three elements of agriculture – namely land (土地), labor (勞力), and capital (資本) – complement each other during busy and slack times (繁閑相補) and correspond to urgent and non-urgent needs (緩急相應), ensuring that not even an inch of land (寸土), a bit of labor (細勞), or a pittance of capital (零資) is ever wasted or used in vain.

In essence, agriculture is a lifelong industry. Therefore, the principle is to invest the minimum possible actual cost to achieve the maximum possible income. In other words, land should be used appropriately, never left abandoned as empty land, nor should one ignore the detrimental practice of continuous cropping (連作 - cultivating the same crop in the same place every year) which leads to soil depletion (地力減衰). While striving to obtain the greatest possible profit from the smallest possible land area, one must, on the other hand, fully utilize and distribute labor (勞力) so that not even a moment (寸陰片時) is wasted in idleness with folded hands (拱手, 遊惰), planning its use so that there is no interruption throughout the four seasons, thereby maximizing the effectiveness of labor. This is truly a vital matter in agricultural management that cannot be overlooked even for a single day. Therefore, the strategy to ensure appropriate land use and complete labor distribution, leaving no room for regret regarding the principles of agricultural management, is something the Government-General of Chosŏn (朝鮮總督府) may well be considering appropriately. However, we loudly proclaim: it lies in encouraging (諭勵) each farming household to engage in suitable side businesses. Comparing today with five or six years ago, side businesses have also become considerably widespread, but their facilities (設施) and techniques (技術) are still in a rudimentary (幼稚) stage. Believing there is a need for further improvement (改善) henceforth, I record my humble opinion (愚論).

One. What are Farm Household Side Businesses?

The term "side business" (副業) is a relative, comparative appellation, not an absolute meaning. That is, a side business is work managed during the leisure time from the main occupation (主業). In other words, it refers to activities that have a supportive relationship (輔車) to the main occupation, utilizing idle labor (閑散의 勞力) and surplus land, machinery, etc., aiming to achieve the greatest possible effect from that work. Therefore, due to differences in climate and natural features (氣候 風土), methods of business management, and local conditions, it is quite common, as we recognize daily, for the main occupation of area A to be a side business in area B, and the side business here to be the main occupation there. Thus, it can be known that a side business is by no means a singular, special type of work.

Two. Types of Farm Household Side Businesses

Traditionally, excluding two or three special cases, if we compare and observe farming households in Chosŏn overall, their main occupation can be inferred to be grain cultivation, namely main grain agriculture (主穀農業). Thus, if we set the standard point of observation on main grain agriculture, then all farming household activities other than grain cultivation <114> can be collectively called side businesses without issue. Therefore, the types of side businesses have a very wide range and their number is too great to enumerate one by one. However, classifying the main ones here, we can select twelve types: cultivation of vegetables (蔬菜), fruit trees (果樹), and industrial crops (工藝作物); pig farming (養豚), chicken farming (養鷄), rabbit farming (養兎), beekeeping (養蜂), fish farming (養魚), sericulture (養蠶); manufacturing of industrial products (工産物 製造), fruit processing (果物 製造), and forestry product manufacturing (林産物 製造). Although some among these, by the nature of the work, are similar to the main occupation, depending on the management method, they can generally be considered most suitable side businesses to complement main grain agriculture, utilize the agricultural off-season (農閑), and achieve well-rounded use of land and labor.

Three. Points to Note When Selecting a Side Business

As mentioned before, farm household side businesses are numerous in type, and due to factors like land and climate, what is advantageous in area A can often be detrimental in area B. Therefore, farming households should carefully consider and research the land conditions, climate, state of the main occupation management, market demand, family relationships, etc., and then select the most suitable type among them.

Four. Benefits of Farm Household Side Businesses

The benefits of farm household side businesses are generally known to people, so there is no need to waste further superfluous words. However, distinguishing between tangible and intangible benefits, let me note the main points:

One. Tangible Benefits
1. Creating a foundation for industrial development.
Observing the sequence of industrial development, it initially sprouts from small-scale household industry (家庭工業) and gradually develops, eventually reaching today's large-scale factory industry (工場工業), as seen in daily examples like flour milling, beer brewing, sugar manufacturing, etc. Since agricultural manufacturing (農産 製造) is a form of household industry, if research and development are gradually pursued from this base, a foundation for independent industry can be obtained in the future.
2. Increasing national wealth (國富) and raising local purchasing power.
If each of the over 2,300,000 farming households across the peninsula produces even small amounts through their respective side businesses, calculating the aggregate sum, it will surely reach a significant amount that cannot be lightly dismissed. Consequently, it is indeed clear that the purchasing power of farming households in the localities will also rise.
3. Enabling agriculture to be managed economically and systematically.
Traditionally, Chosŏn farming households have lacked economic thinking, and their management methods have been extremely disorganized and disorderly (亂雜無序). Having absolutely no (毫無) long-term plans, they are preoccupied only with immediate (目前) profits (汲汲), thus never escaping the status of minimal farming with 2-3 sŏk [unit of volume] throughout their lives – this can indeed be called a common malaise of Chosŏn farming households. <115> However, once they recognize the benefits of side businesses and earnestly implement them, agriculture will then transform economically and systematically, finally conforming to the principles of production, and profits will also double compared to before.
4. Enriching farm household economy.
As stated above, side businesses are originally managed during the leisure time from the main occupation. Therefore, the income generated from them becomes an extra-budgetary profit (算外利益) for the farming household compared to before. Thus, it is a natural course of events (理勢) that it enriches their economy.
5. Providing suitable division of labor to the old, young, men, and women, thereby greatly increasing the effectiveness of labor.
The traditional main occupation, namely main grain agriculture, by the nature of its work, requires much physical labor (筋勞), thus becoming the exclusive task of adult men and women (壯年者). It is generally unsuitable for the elderly, young, and women, naturally creating a surplus of labor within a household – this is clear in fact. However, if appropriate side businesses are selected for the surplus labor of these elderly, young, and women, and each is given a suitable division of labor, the effectiveness of the farm household's labor can be increased, yielding considerable profit.

Two. Intangible Benefits
1. Making the family harmonious and cheerful (團圝和樂).
Since side businesses are originally based on the household, there is no need to go far outside the home to seek scattered occupations. Therefore, the entire family can naturally manage the business together harmoniously.
2. Cultivating the spirit of self-reliance and self-support (自立自活).
Because side businesses provide suitable division of labor to the weak, old, men, and women, each person clarifies their own responsibility (責任) and comes to apply their own ideas (考案) to their respective tasks.
3. Correcting the evils of idleness and dissipation (遊惰放逸) and cultivating the fine custom of diligence and strenuous effort (勤勉力行).
The vice of idleness and dissipation is by no means an innate (先天的) human spirit but a habit acquired later (後天的 慣習) fostered by having no occupation to engage in, leading to excess time for mind and body. Therefore, by providing suitable side businesses, the surplus of mind and body can be put to good use.
4. Providing a stable livelihood (恒産) and enabling a constant mind (恒心).
The depopulation of rural areas and the swelling (膨大) of urban populations result from farming households lacking a stable livelihood and a constant mind. If side businesses are encouraged (奬勵) to provide a stable livelihood, a constant mind will naturally arise. Once a constant mind arises, the ill of pointlessly concentrating in cities can be remedied.
5. Instilling a sense of fondness (好愛) for agriculture.
Generally, people never develop an interest (趣味) in work unsuitable for their nature and abilities; on the contrary, a feeling of aversion (忌避) arises. Moreover, even if <116> it is suitable work, if it is always simple and unchanging throughout the four seasons, a sense of weariness (倦怠) naturally develops. Therefore, if farming households provide each family member with a suitable division of labor and ensure there is variety in the work, a kind of new interest in agriculture will arise, leading them to know the true pleasure (眞 快樂) of agriculture.
As discussed above, it can be known that farm household side businesses provide numerous benefits (裨益) to the agricultural world and general society, whether directly or indirectly, tangibly or intangibly. Regarding this, if asked what business we would introduce as a suitable side business for all of Chosŏn, we would say without hesitation (忌憚) that few can surpass sericulture (蠶業). Consider this: the magnificent 3,000-ri landscape (三千里 江山) has much fertile land and good fields (沃土良田), suitable for mulberry cultivation (栽桑). The temperate climate (氣候 溫突) throughout the mountains and fields of the 13 provinces is most suitable, making it an especially excellent natural silkworm-raising country (天然的 養蠶國) for silkworm rearing (蠶兒飼育). We are confident that the future of Chosŏn society will become a prosperous nation (富國) enriched by the silk industry (蠶絲業), and thus introduce it here as the final conclusion. (End) <117>

**Summary**

This 1922 essay by Yi Sŏnghwan, a Korean residing in Kyoto, argues urgently for the adoption of side businesses (副業 - puŏp) by Chosŏn's farmers, who constitute 80% of the population. He observes that while farmers' living standards are rising rapidly due to modernization (new clothing, housing, goods), they face severe economic pressure from increased taxes, education costs, and the lure of cities drawing away young people. Without diversification beyond traditional grain farming, farmers risk ruin. Yi proposes various side businesses like animal husbandry, beekeeping, and manufacturing, emphasizing the efficient use of land, labor (especially utilizing women, children, and the elderly), and capital during off-seasons. He outlines both tangible benefits (economic gain, foundation for industry, increased purchasing power) and intangible ones (family harmony, work ethic, self-reliance, stemming rural exodus, fostering love for agriculture). Ultimately, he strongly advocates for sericulture (養蠶 - yangjam) as the most promising side business for Korea, citing its suitability to the land and climate. From a historical perspective, the article vividly portrays the socio-economic transformations and anxieties in early colonial Korea, highlighting the impact of modernization, changing consumption, rural-urban dynamics, and the economic plight of the peasantry. Historians might find the detailed description of changing lifestyles, the explicit mention of the need for economic self-defense under prevailing conditions (implicitly colonial), the push for specific side-businesses like sericulture (often promoted by colonial authorities for export), and the perspective of a Korean intellectual observing his homeland from Japan particularly interesting.

우리 農家에 必要한 副業을 論함
						在京都 李晟煥
우리 農民은 1,390餘萬人에 達하야 우리 總人口의 約 8割 以上을 占하얏스니, 實로 朝鮮의 中堅을 構成한 貴重階級에 屬하얏도다. 然卽 農民의 貧富와 農業의 消長이 直接 或 間接으로 朝鮮의 社會民命에 地極히 重大한 影響을 波及함은 吾人의 贅言을 要할 餘地가 無하도다.
然而近時에 處한 우리 農民의 生活 狀態를 實際로 觀察하건대, 時勢風潮의 輸入과 最新文化의 發達된 所致로써 그 程度가 可驚할 全急馬力으로 激速히 向上되고, 長足으로 進步하는 바 一一이 枚擧키 難하나, 二三의 例를 論하면 即, 衣食住 3者에 對하야 衣服은 褐麻옷이 木綿옷 되고, 木綿 옷이 綿紬, 綿紬옷이 洋毛紗로 變하야 洋服이 流行되며, 食事凡節은 不潔이 變하야 日常 衛生에 適合하게 淸潔을 主하며, 住屋은 草家가 瓦家되고, 單式이 複式 2層으로 變遷되는도다. 또 이뿐 아니라, 前日에는 1圓 可量으로도 滿足하던 冠網이 今日에는 5倍 以上의 中折帽, 中山帽, 麥幹帽 或은 陰陽紗笠으로 進步되얏스며, 前日 草履가 今日에는 洋式 구두로 化行하야, 時代의 變遷과 並히 1步도 讓치 안는 生活程度는 高尙의 極度로 向上이 되어가고, 又 一面으로 國費多端하야 賦課收斂이 年年 增加 하며, 就學兒童의 智識熱은 旣前보담 10倍 澎湃하야 그로 從하야 敎育費가 日增月加치 아니치 못할 今日이며, 其他 農家 子弟로셔 新風潮에 醉하야 遠히 農村을 逃躱하야 京城, 平壤 等 都會處에 集中하얏도다. 換言하면, 農家의 變節漢으로 知識慾이 生한 所以로다. 如此한 時期를 當하야 農民된 者 何等의 自衛方 또는 救急法을 講究치 아니하면, 終乃 農民으로써 此世에 立키 難한 悲境에 陷入함을 不免할지라. 然則, 其救急法과 自衛方은 何를 云함인고, 卽 農家 自家의 富力을 增進하고, 農家 自家의 資力을 涵養함이니 其 富力을 增進하고 其 資力을 涵養함에는 從來의 米麥穀實 等의 主穀農業과 相待하야 此와 脣齒輔車의 ＜113＞ 密接한 關係를 有한 養蠶, 養畜, 養蜂, 養魚 又는 農産, 林産, 水産製造 及 蔬菜, 果樹栽培 等의 副業을 營作하야 農業의 3要素 即 土地, 勞力, 資本의 3者로 하야곰 繁閑相補하고 緩急相應하야 寸土, 細勞, 零資라도 決코 徒費虛用함이 無하여야 할지로다.
要컨대 農業은 一生 産業이라 故로 될 수 잇는대로 最小한 實費를 投하야 最大한 收得을 擧함이 原則이 되나니 換言하면 土地를 適當히 使用하야 決코 空地로 放棄하거나 又或 連作(每年 同處에 同作物을 栽培하는 것)으로부터 生하는 地力減衰를 不顧하는 弊端이 無케 하며 又 最小한 地積에서 可及的 最大한 收益을 獲得하도록 勉勵하는 同時에 一面으로 勞力을 完全히 利用 分配하야 寸陰片時라도 拱手, 遊惰에 空費치 勿하고 四時에 間斷함이 無하도록 其 活用을 圖謀하야 勞力의 效果를 絶大케 함은 果是 農業, 經營上 1日이라도 等閑히 看過치 못할 緊要한 事-라 然則 如斯히 土地 使用을 適當히 하며 勞力 分配를 完全히 하야 農業 經營의 原則에 秋毫라도 遺憾됨이 無케 하는 策略은 朝鮮總督府로부터 相當히 考究함도 有하거니와 吾人은 大聲疾呼하야 曰 農家에게 各各 適當한 副業을 經營하도록 諭勵함에 在하다 하노라. 五六 年 前과 今日을 比較컨대 副業도 亦是 相當히 普及되얏스나 그러나 그 設施와 技術은 오히려 幼稚의 域에 處하얏스니 今後로 一層 改善의 手를 下할 必要가 有하다 하야 愚論을 記하노라.

一. 農家 副業은 何뇨

副業이라 함은 相對 比較의 呼稱이오 絶對的의 意味는 아니니 即 副業은 主業의 餘暇에 經營하는 業務, 更言하면 主業에 對하야 輔車의 關係를 有하야 閑散의 勞力을 利用하고 剩餘의 土地 器械 等을 利用하야 其 業務에서 될 수 잇는대로 最大한 效果를 得으로 目的하는 者를 稱함이니 是故로 氣候 風土의 相違와 業務 經營의 方法과 地方의 狀況으로 因하야 甲地의 主業이 乙地에 副業되고 此處의 副業이 彼處에 主業 되는 等事가 頗多함은 吾人의 日常 認識하는 바요 又 副業은 決코 單獨 特殊한 業務가 아님을 可知할 지로다.

二. 農家 副業의 種類

從來 朝鮮의 農業은 2, 3 特殊한 境遇를 除外하고 農家 全般을 比較 觀察하면 其 主業은 穀物栽培 即 主穀農業이라 推斷함을 可得할 지로다. 然則 如此히 觀察 標準點을 主穀農業에 置하면, 穀物栽培 以外의 一切 農家의 業務는 擧＜114＞ 副業이라 總稱함도 無妨하도다. 然故로 副業의 種類는 그 範圍가 甚廣하고 其 數가 太多하야, 一一이 枚擧키 不能하나 玆에 그 主要한 者를 類別하면 蔬菜, 果樹, 工藝作物 栽培, 養豚, 養鷄, 養兎, 養蜂, 養魚, 養蠶, 工産物 製造, 果物 製造 及 林産物 製造 等의 12種을 選得할지로다. 然而 此內에 業務의 性質上 主業과 近似한 者도 亦是 不無하나 經營 方法의 如何에 因하야는 大槪 主穀農業과 相待하야 農閑을 利用하고, 土地 勞力의 利用을 圓滿히 함에 對하야 最히 適切한 副業이라 云할지로다.

三. 副業 選擇上의 注意

前述함과 如히 農家의 副業은 그 種類도 夥多하고 又 土地 氣候 等의 關係로 因하야 甲地에서 有利한 事가 乙地에서 損害 되는 事도 頗多한 즉, 農家는 土地의 狀況과 氣候의 如何와 主業 經營의 狀態와 市場의 需要와 家族의 關係 等에 依하야 深重히 考察 硏究한 後에 其中 最適한 種類를 選擇함이 可하도다.

四. 農家 副業의 利益

農家 副業의 利益은 世人의 一般 知悉하는 바-라 更히 贅言을 徒費할 必要는 無하나 玆에 有形的, 無形的으로 區分하야 그 主要한 點을 摘記하건대

一. 有形의 利益
1. 工業 發達의 基礎를 作함.
工業 發達의 順序를 見하면 그 最初에는 擧皆 小規模의 家庭工業에서 萌芽를 發하야 漸次 發達되어 終乃 今日 大規模의 工場工業에 達함은 彼 製粉業, 麥酒釀造業, 砂糖製造業 等에서 日常 目擊하는 實例로다. 然而 農産 製造는 一家庭 工業인 즉 此外에서 漸次 硏究 發達을 企圖하면 他日 獨立 工業의 基礎를 可得할 지로다.
2. 國富를 增加하고 地方의 購買力을 上進케 함.
全 半島 230餘萬 戶의 農家가 各其 副業으로 因하야 家家戶戶의 生産하는 些少한 物産도 此를 綜合而計之하면 決코 輕視치 못할 大多額에 達할지니 此를 從하야 地方에 在한 農家의 購買力도 亦是 上進할 바는 實로 瞭然한 事-로다.
3. 農業을 經濟的 組織的으로 經營케 함.
由來 朝鮮農家는 經濟的 思想이 缺乏하고 又 經營 方法도 至極히 亂雜無序하야 永遠의 計劃은 毫無하고 目前의 利益에만 汲汲하야 終生토록 2,3石의 最小農을 不免함은 實로 朝鮮農家의 一般通弊라 云할 지로다. ＜115＞ 然이나 1次 副業의 利益을 認識하고 銳意로 此를 實行함에 至하면 於是乎 農業은 經濟的, 組織的으로 變化되야 비롯오 生産의 原則에 適合하고 又 收益이 倍前할 지로다.
4. 農家經濟를 潤澤케 함.
上述함과 如히 副業은 元來 主業의 餘暇에 經營하는 者인즉 此에서 生하는 收益은 從來에 比하야 農家의 算外利益이 되나니 然故로 그 經濟를 潤澤케 함은 自然한 理勢라 云할 지로다.
5. 老幼男女에게 各其 適當한 分業을 給하야 勞力의 效果를 大多케 함.
由來의 主業 即 主穀農業은 그 業務 性質上 筋勞를 多要함으로 男女 壯年者의 專務가 되고 老幼婦女子에게는 大體上 不適하야 自然히 一家 內에 勞力의 剩餘를 生함은 事實上 明瞭하도다. 然이나 萬若 此等 老幼婦女子의 剩餘한 勞力에 適當한 副業을 選擇하야 各其 適當한 分業을 給하면 農家 勞力의 效果를 增大하야 收益이 不少할 지로다.

二.無形의 利益
1. 家庭을 團圝和樂케 함.
副業은 元是 家庭으로 基礎를 삼는 業務인즉 家庭 外에 遠出하야 散散된 職業을 求할 必要가 無한 故로 自然히 一家族이 團圝中에서 和樂히 經營함을 可得할 지로다.
2. 自立自活의 精神을 涵養함
副業은 老弱男女에게 適切한 分業을 給하는 者인 故로 各各 自己의 責任을 明白히 하고 又 各其 業務에 對하야 自己의 考案을 運用함에 至하리로다.
3. 遊惰放逸의 弊害를 改悛하고 勤勉力行의 美風을 涵養함.
遊惰放逸의 弊는 決코 人類의 先天的 精神이 아니오 從事할 바 職業이 無하야 心身에 餘裕를 生함으로써 養成되는 後天的 慣習인즉 適當한 副業을 給하야 心身의 餘裕를 善用함을 可得할 지로다.
4. 恒産을 給하며 恒心이 有케 함
地方 人口가 消散하고 都會 人口가 膨大함은 農家에 恒産과 恒心이 無한 結果로 因함인즉 萬一 副業을 奬勵하야 恒産을 給하면 自然히 恒心이 生하고 恒心이 生하면, 空然히 都會에 集中하는 弊를 可救할 지로다.
5. 農業에 對하야 好愛의 念을 發케 함.
大凡 人은 自己의 性質과 力量에 不適한 業務에 對하야는 決코 趣味가 不生하고 反히 忌避의 念이 發生하며 又 設或 ＜116＞ 適當한 業務라 云할 지라도 四時를 通하야 恒常 單純 無變化하면 自然히 倦怠의 念이 生하는 法인즉 農家에서도 其 家族에게 各各 適當한 分業을 給하고 又 業務에 變化가 有케 하면 農業에 對하야 一種의 新趣味가 發生하야 農業의 眞 快樂을 知得함에 至할 지로다.
以上에 論述함과 如히 農家의 副業은 直接 或 間接 又는 有形 或 無形으로 農界 及 一般社會에 對하야 裨益되는 바- 甚多함을 可知로다. 吾人은 此에 就하야 何業으로써 朝鮮 全體에 適當한 副業이라고 紹介하겟느냐 하면 忌憚이 無히 蠶業에 過할 者-少하다 하노라. 생각할 지어다. 華麗한 三千里 江山에 沃土良田이 多有하니 栽桑에 適合하며 溫暖한 13道 山野에 氣候 溫突이 最適하니 蠶兒飼育에는 尤良한 天然的 養蠶國이로다. 우리 朝鮮社會의 將來는 蠶絲業으로 潤澤한 富國이 되리라고 自信하야 玆에 最後 結論으로 紹介하노라. (完)＜117＞
