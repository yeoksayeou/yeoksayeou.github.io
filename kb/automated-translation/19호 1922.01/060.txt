余의 回顧와 展望
						李鍾麟
緖言 (Introduction)

My beloved brothers! I, who was embraced by fervent affection like the morning sun, I, who was enveloped in bright light like the first moon, suddenly one day left such affection, such light, to become a lonely figure of tragedy beneath gloomy, melancholic iron bars. When I crane my neck again and again, wondering if the first moon over Wŏnbong peak is your faces, and look sideways again and again, wondering if the morning sun over Inwang mountain brings news of you, what hope did I hold for you? And beyond hope, what resentment might I have felt? Thus, for three years, hoping while resenting, resenting while hoping, I have now come back into this world. To have obtained even this humble opportunity to open my heart and pour out my deepest feelings before you is truly due to your powerful wishes and your meritorious virtue. However, in the meantime, the great wheel of the world has added the full speed of wind and lightning, completing the course of 30 years, nay, a century, in just three years. In this age where falling even one step behind leaves no hope of catching up, I, who inherently stumble every five steps and fall every ten, have fallen behind by a century. How can I speak of the dangers and ease of which mountains and rivers, or the distances to which pavilions and stations? I can only gaze upon the future path pioneered by your blood and tears, and intend to advance whenever and wherever I can, according to my heart and strength, be it a village a day or a foot a month. When facing cracked rocks and blue cliffs, please pull my hand; when passing over high peaks and absolute summits, please support my feet.

余의 回顧 (My Retrospect)

Looking back on the course of my 38 years, half a lifetime, excluding the time on my dear mother's lap when I bent my slender fingers asking "How old am I this year?", every year upon this day, I would invariably rise early in the clear morning, inhale the fresh air of the great universe, and with the first step of a thousand li and the first stirrings of myriad thoughts, I would confess before you what I intended to do that year:
"This year, I shall cast off the false makeup of rouge and powder and become my true self, complete from head to tail." <36> "This year, I shall cast off the frivolity of wind and rain flowers and become my dignified self, like Mount Tai or Qiao Yue." "This year, I shall cast off the tragedy of 'when the hare dies, the fox grieves' and become my peaceful self, like the divine tortoise and auspicious phoenix." "This year, I shall cast off the obscurity of vast seas and dense fog and become my bright self, like the blue sky and white sun." "This year, I shall cast off the flattery and artifice of morning parrots and evening foxes and become my noble self, like the cloud-traveling swan and snow crane." "This year, I shall cast off the vain glory of rainbow bridges and mirage towers and become my true self, like unrefined gold and uncut jade." "This year, I shall cast off the petty squabbling of 'your territory, my domain' and become the self of the immeasurably vast world." "This year, I shall cast off the convention of mending tracks and propping up pillars and become the creative self that traverses past and present, vertically exhausting the void." "Then, I shall shed the shell of the self, encompassing all forms and formlessness, sorrow and joy, and become the self that comes and goes alone, roaming freely and contentedly." "Then, re-entering this world, whether holding an alms bowl and begging for food at the gate, or wielding a knife and cutting meat in the kitchen, I shall have nothing to be ashamed of; whether raising a whip and subduing the heroes of the land beneath my horse, I shall also have nothing to deem especially precious." You would nod your heads, saying, "Great are your words, sir! Grand is your ambition, sir! If you ascend the high peak and absolute summit, we shall climb by your heels; if you face the cracked rocks and blue cliffs, we shall lead you by the hand. Do not waver in this word, do not retreat from this ambition, but follow our lead. The world is a strong enemy; it will not fear you and throw down its sword, but the more you advance, the more it will advance. Time is impartial; it will not wait for you and stop its whip, but the more you run, the more it will run. If you do not exert your full heart, full strength, full speed – ten for their one, a thousand for their hundred – you will surely become a captive of the world and a discard of time." Thus, with this earnest admonition engraved in the depths of my heart, I then drove the fine horse of the year star (Time) and plunged into the world, the strong enemy, intending to gradually pioneer the territory of my various selves. But when I cast my eyes about, gold was like water and beautiful women like flowers. Under the condition "How long can life last? Better to follow my desires," is that noble young man on the white horse with the golden whip not the lowly fellow who yesterday prepared ritual vessels on the eastern green mountain? Is that noble lady with the phoenix crown and jade belt not the courtesan who last night played the pipa on the Xunyang River (潯陽江)? Under the condition "There are no seamless clothes, there are no flawless people," rather than confessing inner ugliness and inviting external criticism, it is better to apply false rouge and powder; if fortunate, one becomes a noble lady or gentleman; if unfortunate, there is nothing to be ashamed of. Under the condition "Who, with head touching heaven and feet on the earth, does not wish to command the breadth of the universe and conquer the strength of heroes? But what can be done when the child of fate is extremely unlucky?" Under the condition "If the whole world is turbid and I alone remain pure, it is not only useless to the world but will also become a fuse leading to my own disaster." Under these conditions, I surrendered the territories of the various selves I had hoped for, the territories of the various selves you had warned me about, without firing a single shot, kneeling with both hands before the world. <37> However, year after year, the thought of self-pardon and self-consolation was: my years are still few; if I cannot fulfill my long-cherished ambition this year, then next year; if not that year, then the year after next. Year after year, thus and thus again, until this very day, where has gone the youthful me of thirty years, when flowers were beautiful and the moon seemed plump? Where is the courageous me who would wrestle tigers and capture living dragons? Where is the spirited me who would embrace wind and frost and overturn the Milky Way? Where is the magnanimous me who would swallow the Yunmeng marshes and exhale Mount Heng? Where is the compassionate me who would cast away this body to atone for the sins of the common people? Where is the virtuous me who would exhaust this heart to save the drowning world? All have vanished, leaving only these few strands of frosty hair at my temples, only the advancing march step by step towards the grave.
Alas, my brothers! Have you not also, striving to pioneer the territories of the selves mentioned above since your youth of fifteen or twenty, exhausted your courage, your spirit, your magnanimity, your compassion, your virtue – whatever you possessed – fighting fiercely and struggling hard with a single horse and spear? Have you not sometimes made peace treaties with broken armor and remnant cavalry? Have you not sometimes wailed and cried sorrowfully with resentful faces and tear-stained clothes, arriving at this day? And yet, while mourning and weeping for my own past, I raise my eyes and glance around at you. The sincere people who, three years ago today, declared "Though the seas dry up and rocks decay, I shall remain steadfast," today, half have faint breath in the west wind and setting sun, and half are like the cuckoo crying mournfully under the cool moon in the empty mountains. The rich and noble families who, three years ago today, declared "Though heaven collapses and earth falls, I shall long endure," today, half have wild weeds rustling desolately amidst broken walls and ruined foundations, and half have lonely melon sheds in the old fields outside the city walls. The rest – widowers, widows, orphans, the childless, the hungry, cold, and sick – are still the same desolate figures as three years ago. How can I not mourn and weep for you? However, that I am made to mourn and weep for myself is my own doing, but that you are made to receive my mourning and weeping is not your own doing, but the fault of this world. Why should I mourn and weep only for you? Still, that I am granted this place today, to look back on the past while hoping for the future – if not you, who else could it be? If not you, who else?

余의 展望 (My Prospect)

While these years become ever newer as they pass, our lives become ever older as they pass. If our houses become old, they can be instantly renewed with immeasurable wood and stone; if our clothes become old, they can be instantly renewed with inexhaustible brocade and silk. But once this life becomes old, there is no day it can be renewed. Therefore, regardless of wisdom or folly, that one's thoughts and endeavors become newer day by day as one's life grows older may seem to be for the sake of living high and long in this world, but it is a natural duty and responsibility towards this world. Can one stop even if one wishes to stop? Can one avoid it even if one wishes to avoid it? Today is New Year's Day, when your lives retreat one step, and your endeavors advance one step. <38> I ask you, this first step of your ten-thousand-li journey today – in which direction does it begin, towards which direction does it head, and in which direction will it end? As stated above, even I, who look back every five steps and stumble every ten, wish to follow you wherever you go. If you have crossed mountains, I too will follow over mountains; if you have crossed waters, I too will follow through waters, treading closely on your heels. But having fallen behind by the vast distance of a century, will I not encounter some misguided farmer (詒曰左의 田夫)? Will there not be illusory realms like "When spring comes, everywhere is peach blossom water (春來遍是桃花水)"? This is certainly a doubt. Worried about this, I cannot grasp hold of your progress, which covers a thousand li in an instant, and ask you to travel slowly together. And I lack the divine ability to cover ten thousand li in one step. What is to be done about this? However, the vast blue sea covering the earth did not come from a single drop, but gradually, drop by drop; the high bird emerging from the clouds did not reach there in a single soar, but soaring higher and higher in sequence, it reached such a vast, boundless, high, and distant realm. Therefore, no matter the endeavor, if one seeks its actualization, one would rather the seedlings be barren than wish for a momentary downpour, and rather the stomach be empty than take a handful of bolted food. Though nothing feels better than rain on early seedlings or food for a hungry stomach, a downpour can easily wash away the roots, and bolting food often obstructs the throat. Now, what I earnestly hope from you is this: do not be dazzled by the colors of red, yellow, blue, and green; do not be flustered by the force of violent winds and swift thunder. Simply, according to your sincere hearts, stop where you should stop and move when you should move, fulfilling your responsibilities and duties. The issues you cry out for most desperately today are, first, the problem of education, and second, the problem of industry. What else could possibly be put aside by us? However, although your sincerity may be heeded, the times do not heed you; although your hands and eyes may permit, your circumstances do not permit – this is the present reality. Meanwhile, glancing at the current state of society: those who wear the cap of the Duke of Zhou (周公) and the robes of Confucius (仲尼), opening their mouths to immediately speak of benevolence and righteousness in the world – I regard them as gentlemen (君子). Those who hold the mysterious scripture of Laozi (老君) and wear the true pearls of the Tathagata (如來) around their necks, raising their eyes to immediately lament the suffering of the world – I regard them as scholars of the Way (道學). Those who hang a fishing line by the clear Wei River (淸渭) or plow the fields of Nanyang (南陽) while grandly discussing the gains and losses of the world – I regard them as heroes (英雄). Those who compose poems about the autumn chrysanthemums by the Xiang River bank (湘畔) or pick up withered plums in Yuling (於陵) while looking askance at the base greed of the world – I regard them as persons of integrity and incorruptibility (介廉). Those who mourn the desolate grave of Wang Zhu (望諸) or visit the old house of Tian Guang (田光), lamenting that they have no true friend (知己) in the world – I regard them as persons of righteous indignation (慷慨). Those who relax their cheeks like Xunzi and Zhuangzi (荀莊) or wag their tongues like Chunyu Kun and Zhang Yi/Su Qin (髡衍) – I have no time but to revere and adore such persons as the great orators (辯士) of the world. However, I see only their appearance and force; I do not yet nod assent to their sincerity. They fail to stop where they should naturally stop and fail to move when they should naturally move, merely bustling about noisily and clamoring insistently, potentially confusing the calm, composed, and serious among you. Consider this: <39> it is not that the cap of the Duke of Zhou or the robes of Confucius are not venerable, but are they suitable for our place today? It is not that fishing with a straight hook (直針) or sleeping in a thatched cottage (草堂) is not lofty, but are they also suitable for our time today? Public opinion on this must already be settled.

結論 (Conclusion)

The final word I cannot refrain from adding is this: that I have been unable to establish even one territory of my self for thirty years and have come to beg for your faint light and remaining grace is not the fault of this world, but rather these three: next year, next month, next day. This year is only this year's this year, this month is only this month's this month, today is only today's today. Believing that next year, next month, next day would also contain this year, this month, this day – alas, my half-life has been wasted! My beloved brothers, following this, I respectfully offer a quatrain poem to praise and wish you well for the New Year:

多希多望此新年 (So many hopes and wishes for this New Year,)
卽看朝陽上赫然 (Immediately see the morning sun rising brilliantly.)
大地山河千萬里 (The great earth, mountains and rivers, for ten thousand li,)
一時拭目仰東天 (All at once wipe their eyes and gaze up at the eastern sky.) <40>
<36-40>

**Summary**

Written upon release after three years of imprisonment (likely related to the March 1st Movement), Yi Chong-nin (李鍾麟) reflects on his past 38 years, lamenting his failure to achieve youthful ideals and succumbing to worldly compromises and despair. He contrasts his past aspirations for self-cultivation and societal contribution with his current state of disillusionment and awareness of lost time. Looking forward (Prospect), he acknowledges the rapid changes in the world and his own backwardness but urges his "brothers" (fellow intellectuals/activists) to pursue progress, particularly in education and industry, with sincerity and steady effort, avoiding superficiality and rashness despite the difficult circumstances (colonial rule). He critiques contemporaries who adopt the outward forms of traditional sages or heroes without genuine substance or timely action. The article concludes with a poem expressing hope for the new year. For historians, the text offers insight into the psychological impact of imprisonment on early Korean nationalists, the sense of urgency and backwardness felt under colonial rule, the internal debates on strategy (gradualism vs. immediate action, substance vs. form), and the blend of traditional East Asian philosophical allusions with modern concerns about national development (education, industry) in the 1920s.

緖言

余의 親愛하는 兄弟 諸君 朝陽가티 熱烈한 愛情에 안기웟던 余 初月가티 皎皎한 光明에 싸이엇던 余가 忽然 一朝에 이러한 愛情 이러한 光明을 떠나서 沈陰幽鬱한 鐵窓下, 悲壯 孤獨의 身이 되어 圓峰 初月은 諸君의 容顔인가 하야, 翹首復翹首하고, 仁王 朝陽은 諸君의 消息인가 하야 側目復側目할 時, 諸君에게 對한 希望은 어떠하얏스며 希望타 못하야 怨恨인들 또한 어떠하얏스랴. 이러케 3年을 希望하면서 怨恨하고 怨恨하면서 希望하던 余가 다시 이 世上에 나와 區區하나마 開襟說心의 一頭地를 得하야 諸君의 前에 滿斗腔血을 瀉케 함은 實로 諸君의 願力이며 諸君의 功德이올시다. 그러하나 그間 世界의 大輪은 風馳電掣의 全速力을 加하야 30年 即 1世紀의 過程을 3年에 告終하얏나니 一步를 落後하야도 追及의 餘望이 無한 今日에 本來 五步一顚, 十步一倒인 余로 一世紀를 落後하얏스니 何山何水의 險易와 何亭何驛의 遠近을 說到하리오. 다만 諸君의 血과 淚로 開拓한 前途를 望하고 一日 一村 一月 一尺이라도 余의 心力대로 何時何地던지 나아가랴 하노니 裂石蒼崖에 臨하거든 余의 手를 당긔여 주시고 高峰絶頂을 過하거든 余의 足을 바치어 주소서.

余의 회고

余의 38年 即 半生의 過程을 回顧하니, 阿母膝上에서 今年에는 余年 幾何라고 纖纖의 指를 屈하던 時節을 除外하고는 年年 今日을 當하면 반듯이 淸晨早起하야 大宇宙 新空氣를 一吸하고 千里初步 萬念初萌으로 그 해에 我의 할 바를 諸君의 前에 告白하얏나니
「今年은 紅粉翠黛의 假粧을 去하고 有頭有尾의 眞正한 我가 되오리다.」 ＜36＞「今年은 風가 雨花의 浮輕을 去하고 泰山喬嶽의 鎭重한 我가 되오리다.」 「今年은 兎死狐悲의 慘劇을 去하고 神龜瑞鳳의 平和한 我가 되오리다.」 「今年은 浩海濃霧의 迷朦을 去하고 蒼空白日의 光明한 我가 되오리다.」 「今年은 朝鸚暮狐의 媚巧를 去하고 雲鴻雪鶴의 高尙한 我가 되오리다.」 「今年은 虹橋蜃樓의 虛榮을 去하고 渾金璞玉의 眞實한 我가 되오리다.」 「今年은 爾疆我域의 區區齷齪을 去하고 無量廣大世界의 我가 되오리다.」 「今年은 補轍支柱의 因習을 去하고 橫斷今古 竪盡虛空의 創造我가 되오리다.」 「然後에는 有相無相 可悲可喜 一切의 我殼을 脫하고 獨往獨來 逍遙自適의 我가 되오리다.」 「然後에는 此世에 更入하야 鉢을 持하고 門前에 飯을 乞하야도 刀를 操하고 庖頭에 肉을 截하야도 可愧할 바 無하며 鞭을 擧하야 海內의 群雄을 馬下에 屈하야도 또한 可貴할 바 無한 我가 되오리다」 하면 諸君은 頭를 點하면서 大하다. 君의 言이여 壯하다. 君의 志여 君이 高峰絶頂을 上하거든 吾儂은 君의 趾를 攀躋하며 君이 裂石蒼崖에 臨하거든 五儂은 君의 手를 提携할지니 此言을 二三치 말며 此志를 退屈치 말고 吾儂의 後를 從할지어다. 世界는 强敵이니라. 君을 畏하야 劒을 投치 아니고 君이 進할스록 益益히 進하며 年月은 公道니라. 君을 待하야 鞭을 停치 아니하고 君이 走할스록 益益히 走하나니 彼一我十, 彼百我千의 全心力 全速力을 致치 아니하면 君은 반듯이 世界의 俘虜가 되고 말지며 年月의 棄物이 되고 말지니라. 이와가티 叮寧의 告戒를 肝曲에 記入한 余는 爾乃 太歲의 良馬를 驅하고 强敵의 世界에 突入하야 次第의 我地를 開拓하랴고 眼을 放하야 左右를 顧眄하면 黃金이 如水하고 美人이 如花라. 「人生이 能幾時오 不若從吾好」로다 하는 條件 下에서 彼 白馬金鞭의 貴公子는 昨日 東郭靑山에서 籩豆를 苞하던 賤丈夫가 아니며 彼 鳳冠玉帶의 貴夫人은 昨夜 潯陽江上에서 琵琶를 弄하던 娼家가 아닌가. 「衣無無縫之衣, 人無無垢之人」이라는 條件 下에서 內心의 醜陋를 自白하야 外部의 批判을 取함보다 寧히 紅粉을 假粧하야 幸히 中하면 貴夫人 貴公子요 不幸히 不中이라도 加愧할 자 無하도다 하는 條件 下에서 頂天足地의 誰가 宇宙의 廣을 伸縮하며 羣雄의 强을 征服코저 아니하리오마는 運命兒가 奇窮함에 어찌하리오」 하는 條件下에서 擧世皆濁하되 我獨察察하면 於世에 無益할 뿐 不是라. 自家의 導禍線이 될 뿐」이라는 條件 下에서 余의 期待하던 諸我의 地, 諸君의 告戒하던 諸我의 地를 一失도 不發하고 世界의 前에 雙手跪呈 하얏나니다. ＜37＞그러하나 年年이 自恕自慰의 一念은 我年이 尙早하니 今年에 余의 素志를 了償치 못하면 明年에 明年 其年에 또 못하면 又 明年에 年年如是復如是하야 今年 今日에 至하야는 30年間 花如其美 月如其肥하던 少年吾 生虎를 搏하며 活龍을 捉하랴던 膽力吾 風霜을 挾하고 河漢을 倒하랴던 氣槪吾 雲夢을 呑하고 恒山을 吐하랴던 胸量吾 此身을 擲하야 蒼生의 죄를 贖하랴던 慈悲吾 此心을 盡하야 天下의 溺을 濟하랴던 道德吾가 다 어대로 가 버리고 只個是數莖의 霜鬢 뿐 一步 一步 墳墓에 向하는 進軍曲 뿐.
슯흐다 諸君이여. 諸君도 以上의 我地를 開拓하랴고 少年 十五二十時로부터 諸君의 膽力 諸君의 氣槪 諸君의 胸量 諸君의 慈悲 諸君의 道德 諸君에게 잇는 대로는 心을 盡하고 力을 竭하야 匹馬單槍으로 力戰苦鬪하야보며 敗甲殘騎로 혹 講和協約도 하야 보며 寃臉淚衫으로 或 哀號悲鳴도 하면서 今日까지 引至치 아니 하얏는가. 그러한데 余의 過去를 吊하고 哭하는 同時에 眼을 擧하야 諸君의 左右를 一顧하니 三年前 今日에 海枯石爛하야도 我固在此라 하던 誠心家가 今年 今日 一半은 西風殘照에 氣息이 奄奄하고 一半은 空山凉月에 子規가 凄凄할 뿐 三年 前 今日에 天崩地落하야도 我且長存이라 하던 富貴家가 今年 今日 一半은 敗垣頹礎에 野蒿가 蕭瑟하고 一半은 郭外古畝에 瓜棚이 寂寞할 뿐 其他 鰥寡孤獨 飢寒疾病이 依然히 三年 前 凄凉한 諸君이로다. 諸君을 對하야 吊哭치 아니하리오. 그러나 余로 하야곰 自吊自哭케 함은 余의 自做어니와 諸君으로 하야곰 余의 吊哭을 受케 함은 諸君의 自做가 아니라 此世의 故니 어찌 諸君 뿐 吊哭하리오. 이나마 余로 하야곰 過去를 回顧하면서 將來를 希望하는 今日의 此地를 賜함은 諸君이 아니오 其誰이냐 諸君이 아니오 其誰이냐.

余의 展望

此의 年月은 去할스록 新又新하는 데 吾의 人生은 去할스록 舊又舊하나니 吾處의 屋은 舊하면 積無量의 木石으로 吾衣의 服은 舊하면 藏無盡의 錦帛으로 立地可新 하려니와 此生은 一舊하면 可新의 日이 更無하도다. 그럼으로 智愚를 不問하고 그의 人生이 舊할스록 그의 思想과 事業이 日新함은 自己가 此世에 高居長生을 爲함인 듯하나 此世의 對한 天然的 義務이며 責任이라 已코저 한들 已하며 避코저 한들 避하리오. 今日은 諸君의 人生은 一步를 退하고 諸君의 事業은 一步를 進하는＜38＞ 新年 1日이라 問하노니 諸君의 萬里初步인 今日 一步가 何方面으로 始하야 何方面으로 向하야 何方面에 終하랴는가. 五步一顧, 十步一倒의 余도 어대까지던지 追及하고저 함은 已上에서 陳述한 바이라. 諸君이 山을 越하얏스면 我도 山을 諸君이 水를 渡하얏스면 我도 水를 躡踵하려니와 一世紀의 遠距離를 落後하얏나니 詒曰左의 田夫나 有치 아니할는지 春來遍是桃花水의 幻境이나 無할는지 此固疑問이라 是를 憂하야 一瞬千里의 前行을 徐徐히 同行하자고 붓들 수도 업고 余는 一步萬里의 神能이 無하니 此將奈何오. 그러나 撲地의 滄海는 一滴의 所致가 아니라 滴滴以漸하고 出雲高鳥는 一翶의 所致가 아니라 翶翶以次하야서 如許의 滄茫高遠한 城에 到達하얏나니 그럼으로 何事業을 勿論하고 그의 現實을 圖하랴면 其苗는 寧히 赤하고 已할지언정 一霎의 暴雨를 不願하며 其膓은 寧히 枯할지언정 一掬의 驟食을 不取하나니 早苗의 雨飢膓의 飯처럼 快感일 者 無하건마는 暴雨는 其根을 深流키 容易하고 驟食은 其喉를 梗塞함이 居多함으로써니라. 이제 切實히 諸君에게 希望하는 바는 紅黃碧綠의 色相에 眩暈치 말며 疾風迅雷의 聲勢에 蒼黃치 말고, 諸君의 誠心대로 止할 地에 止하며 動할 時에 動하야 나의 責住과 義務를 盡할 뿐 今日 諸君의 가장 絶呌하는 바는 一曰 敎育 問題이며 二曰 實業 問題이나 기타 何者인들 吾人의 可後할 者리오마는 諸君의 誠心은 聽할지언정 諸君의 時代는 聽치 아니하고 諸君의 手眼은 許할지언정 諸君의 境遇는 許치 아니함은 刻下의 事實이라. 그러한대 今日 社會의 現狀을 一瞥하면 周公의 冠을 冠하며 仲尼의 衣를 衣하고 口를 開하면 便卽天下의 仁義를 說하는 者 余는 君子의 其人으로 老君의 玄經을 手하며 如來의 眞珠를 項하고 目을 擧하면 便卽天下의 苦痛을 悶하는 者 余는 其人을 道學으로 淸渭의 釣를 垂하고 南陽의 田을 耕하면서 天下의 得失을 大談하는 者 余는 英雄其人으로 湘畔의 秋菊을 賦하고 於陵의 枯李를 拾하면서 天下의 鄙貪을 疾視하는 者 余는 其人을 介廉의 人으로 望諸의 荒塜을 吊하고 田光의 古宅을 放하면서 天下의 知己가 無하다고 悲歎하는 者 余는 其人을 慷慨의 人으로 荀莊의 頰을 緩하고 髡衍의 舌을 掉하는 자 其人을 余는 天下의 辯士로 敬畏하고 崇拜함을 不暇하나이다. 그러하나 그의 色相이며 聲勢 뿐 그의 誠心은 아즉 首肯치 아니하노니 當然히 止할 地에 止치 못하며 當然히 動할 時에 動치 못하고 徒然히 紛紛揚揚 噪噪切切하야 도로여 沉凝鎭重한 諸君을 眩惑하게 하는 점이 업지 못하도다. 見할지어다. ＜39＞ 周公의 冠, 仲尼의 衣가 尊重치 아니한 바는 아니지마는 今日 吾人의 地에 適合한가 否한가 直針의 釣, 草堂의 眠이 高尙치 아니한 바는 아니지마는 또한 今日 吾人의 時에 適合한가 否한가 大家의 公評이 已定하얏스리로다.

結論

最後의 一言을 마지 못하는 바는 我로 하야곰 30年間 一我의 地를 建設치 못하고 諸君의 末光餘澤을 乞함에 至케 함은 此世의 故가 아니라 來年 來月 來日 三者가 是로다. 今年은 今年의 今年  今月은 今月의 今月 뿐 今日은 今日의 今日 인 것을, 來年 來月 來日에도 今年 今月 今日이 有하다 하야 嗚呼半生의 我는 誤了하얏도다. 余의 親愛하는 兄弟諸君, 繼하야 謹히 一絶의 詩로 諸君의 新年을 頌祝하나이다.

多希多望此新年, 卽看朝陽上赫然.
大地山河千萬里. 一時拭目仰東天. ＜40＞
＜36-40＞
