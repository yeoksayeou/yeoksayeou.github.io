From the Editorial Office

Our assertion upon greeting the New Year is to live by being reborn as new people, like the newness of the New Year, pioneering a new phase. It can be said that this issue of our magazine primarily expresses the fundamental spirit of this assertion through a record of over two hundred entries.

◇ Among these, hearing the fervent expressions of new people whom we could not encounter for some time, both in the forum of debate and in the literary world, and obtaining several new creative works is truly, without exaggeration, a first record for this field.

◇ At the very beginning of the New Year, introducing the great figure of the industrial world, Mun Sam-u (文三憂), and subsequently including several articles on economic matters! We hope you will consider where the intention lies, and furthermore, anticipate what our attitude towards this aspect (practical matters) will be throughout this year.

◇ The round-the-world journey, "Crossing Mountains and Waters," barely begins its introduction with this issue, but the unparalleled passion emanating from its protagonist, Mr. No (盧氏), and the insertion of scenic masterpieces obtained from the various places visited, will surely have the power to stir the red blood of our young brothers with each passing issue.

◇ We wish that in the New Year, your health (氣體) may be robust, and your thoughts, words, and actions become ever more potent (至毒). And please let much most candid, stern, and sharp criticism regarding this magazine appear under your names. We shall look upon it and use it as a mirror. <117>

**Summary**

This editorial note from the January 1922 issue of *Kaebyŏk* magazine outlines the aspirations for the New Year. The editors emphasize themes of renewal and rebirth ("new people," "new phase"), highlighting the inclusion of new contributors in literary and debate circles. They specifically mention featuring Mun Sam-u, described as a "great figure of the industrial world," signaling an increased focus on economic and practical matters. The start of a serialized travelogue, "Crossing Mountains and Waters" by a Mr. No, is also announced. The piece concludes with well wishes for the readers and a strong appeal for candid and critical feedback. For historians, the article is interesting as it reflects the intellectual currents of early 1920s colonial Korea, particularly the emphasis on national renewal, the introduction of new voices, the nascent interest in economic development (featuring an "industrialist"), and the use of travelogues to broaden horizons, all while operating under colonial constraints. The call for "potent" (至毒) thought and action is also noteworthy.
