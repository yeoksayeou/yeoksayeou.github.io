From Newspaper Errand Boy to President

The U.S. Presidential election battle, which had captured the attention of the world—the contest between Mr. K'aksŭ (Cox) of the Democratic Party and Mr. Harding of the Republican Party—finally resulted in Mr. Harding's victory, making him the 29th master of the White House in America.

What kind of person is Mr. Harding, generally speaking? He was born in 1865 in Corsica, Ohio, and his family was very poor. Therefore, since childhood, he became an errand boy for the Marion Star newspaper published in that area. However, his character was thoroughly sincere and diligent; while working as an errand boy, he occasionally learned skills, became a craftsman, further studied diligently to become a reporter, then advanced to editor-in-chief, and eventually owned the entire company.

Based on that newspaper company, Mr. Harding organized a publishing company and eventually became its managing director (專務取締役). At the age of 35, he was elected from the Marion district and became a State Senator, later became Lieutenant Governor, at 45 became a United States Senator, and leaped forward at the U.S. Republican National Convention on June 8th this year, becoming the favorite son of Ohio. Running as the Republican-selected presidential candidate, he finally attained the crown of glory as the head of state of the wealthiest nation on earth.

In short, he is a great man through and through, having risen from the lowest level of life to the highest echelon. His path was merely climbing step by step up the stairs; he never rode any winds of fortune nor seized any chance opportunities, but solely built his current position through ceaseless strenuous effort. His greatness truly lies here.

In those days when he, as a humble reporter for the newspaper he served, exposed his meager circumstances to the wind, who could have predicted Mr. Harding's today? However, only one maiden, Florence, knew the man he was. This maiden was the daughter of the wealthiest family in that region at the time. Setting aside numerous gentlemen, she declared that only the poor scholar Harding was the object of her admiration. When Mr. Harding was 27, the maiden pleaded with her father, seeking marriage with Mr. Harding, but ultimately incurred her father's wrath, and Miss Florence became part of Mr. Harding's household, almost as if chased out of her own home. Now, it is said that the wife truly had better discernment in judging people (知人之鑑) than her father.

From Mr. Harding's perspective, if a person holds a definite ideal and accumulates step-by-step effort with firm resolve (斷斷其盟), the stage of success eventually turns towards them. Whether one has money or not, whether the times are favorable or unfavorable—such things are not the issue from the outset.<75>

**Summary**

This article details the life story of Warren G. Harding, the newly elected 29th U.S. President, emphasizing his rise from humble beginnings as a poor errand boy for the Marion Star newspaper in Ohio to the presidency. It highlights his diligence, perseverance, and step-by-step advancement through various roles—craftsman, reporter, editor, owner, state senator, lieutenant governor, U.S. Senator, and finally President—attributing his success solely to continuous hard work rather than luck or circumstance. The article also mentions his wife, Florence, who recognized his potential early on and married him despite her wealthy father's disapproval. For historians studying Korean colonial history, this piece is interesting as it presents an American "rags-to-riches" story focused on individual effort and perseverance as the key to success. Published in a Korean magazine in 1920, it could reflect an interest in Western democratic processes and leadership, while potentially serving as an aspirational model or subtle commentary on achieving success through self-reliance, a theme that might resonate within the constraints of colonial rule.

新聞社 使喚으로 大統領이 되기까지
世界人의 主意를 야기하던 美國 大統領 選擧戰―民主黨의 「칵쓰」氏와 共和黨의 「하딩」氏 兩候補의 競爭은 마츰내 하氏의 勝利에 歸하야 그는 米麴 第29代의 白堊館 主人公이 되엇다.
「하」氏는 大體 如何한 人物인가. 그는 1865年 「오하이오」州 「콜시카」의 出生으로서 그의 家는 매우 貧寒하얏다. 그래서 自幼로 同地에서 刊行하는 마리온쓰타 新聞社의 使喚이 되엇다. 그런데 그의 性格은 어대까지 純實勤勉하야 使喚으로 잇스며 間間이 技術을 習得하야 職工이 되고 更히 刻苦하야 記者되고 다시 主幹으로 進하야 아조 그 社를 所有하얏다.
氏는 그 新聞社를 基礎로 하야 出版會社를 組織하고 遂히 同社의 專務取締役이 되엇스며 35歲時에는 「마리온」地로부터 選擧되어 州上院議員이 되고 그 後 州副知事가 되고 45歲에는 合衆國 上院議院이 되고 本年 6月 8日의 米共和黨大會에 一躍하야 「오하이오」州의 寵兒가 되어 共和黨 選出 大統領候補者로 出馬하야 遂히 地上 最大 富國의 元首인 榮冠을 得하얏다.
要컨대 그는 人生의 最低級으로부터 人生의 最上階級에 至한 徹頭徹尾의 偉人이다. 그 경로는 步一步 階段을 登한 것 뿐으로서 何等의 風雲을 乘하얏나니 或은 偶然의 機會를 把한 事가 全無하고 오즉 不斷의 健鬪로써 今日까지의 그 地位를 스스로 築上한 것이다. 그의 거룩한 點은 實로 여긔에 잇다 하겟도다.
그가 스다 新聞社의 一記者로서 초라한 身勢를 風前에 露할 그 當時에 誰가 氏의 今日을 卜하얏스리요. 그런대 오즉 一人의 處女「후로렌쓰」가 그의 사람인 것을 知하얏다. 이 處女는 當時 그 地方唯一 富豪家의 女息이엇는대 幾多紳士를 除하고 오즉 그 貧寒書生인 하딩氏가 自己敬慕의 的이 된다 하야 「하」氏의 27歲時 그 處女는 그 父에게 懇請하야 「하」氏와의 結婚을 求하얏스나 遂히 그 父의 怒를 當하야 후로렌쓰양은 그 집으로 쪽기어나다십히 「하」氏의 집사람이 되엇다. 只今 당하야는 그 夫人이야말로 그 父보다도 知人之鑑이 잇다는 評이다.
「하」氏로써 보면 사람이란 一定한 理想을 가지고 斷斷其盟으로 步一步의 健鬪를 積하면 成功의 舞臺는 遂히 그 압흐로 轉回되는 것이다. 金錢의 有無 時運의 利不利와 如함은 當初에 問題될 것이 업도다.＜75＞
