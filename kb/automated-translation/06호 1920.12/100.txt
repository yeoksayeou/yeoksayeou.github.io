The Flaying of Songhwa and Thirty Ri

The nature of the brothers (people) of Songhwa (松禾) County, Hwanghae-do (黃海道), is said to be particularly tenacious; hypothetically, even if their skin were flayed (剝皮), they could walk 30 *ri* (三十里). Indeed, one should regard human nature as being this fierce (至毒).＜59＞

**Summary**

This short piece reports on a saying about the people of Songhwa County in Hwanghae Province, claiming they possess such extraordinary tenacity that they could walk 30 *ri* (about 12 km) even after being flayed. The article concludes with a reflection that human nature can indeed reach such fierce extremes. From a historical perspective, this article reflects early 20th-century regional stereotypes or folklore within Korea. Historians might find it interesting as an example of how regional character was perceived and discussed, potentially reflecting ideas about endurance, stubbornness, or even harshness, possibly colored by the experiences of the colonial period.
