**Summary**

This text serves as a title and subtitle, "Schools and Students (As of the end of May, Taishō 8 [1919])" and "Korean Education and Japanese Education," followed by a page number. It appears to be the heading for a news item or statistical report comparing the educational situation for Koreans and Japanese within colonial Korea as of late May 1919. The title itself, highlighting the distinct educational tracks and referencing a specific date shortly after the March 1st Movement, is significant for historians. It points towards the segregated nature of the colonial education system and likely prefaces data illustrating the disparities between the resources and opportunities available to the colonizers versus the colonized population during a period of heightened political tension and administrative review.
