Author: Not Specified
Article Type: 잡저 (Miscellaneous Writings/Essay)

Haeju in Hwanghae-do, as the capital of the same province, reaches a population of over 3,000 households, and its citizens are particularly frugal and intelligent. The commerce managed by their hands rivals that of the business world of Kaesŏng in Kyŏnggi Province, and its reputation has been renowned since ancient times. The inksticks and purple dye produced there, though small in quantity, were precious items among Chosŏn's products. However, there is a motto for that place, which says: "Many People, Many Words, Many Stones" (人多, 言多, 石多). That is, "Many People" (人多) refers to the fact that many good people have emerged since ancient times; although a full list of examples cannot be given, starting with the brothers Soryŏn (少連) and Taeryŏn (大連), who were featured early on in China's Chu Hsi's (朱熹) *Xiaoxue* (小學 - Elementary Learning) for their outstanding filial piety, people like Righteous Man An (安義士) and Dr. Yi (李博士) are all people from Haeju. "Many Words" (言多) means that there is much talk of commentary and critique; it means that whenever any issue arises there, it immediately comes to the mouths of the general populace and becomes a type of public opinion. "Many Stones" (石多) means that there are many quarry stones (磚石) there; these are peerless materials for construction, and the famous buildings in that area mostly used these stones. Furthermore, the scenery of water and stones there is truly excellent, and the entire area of Kwangsŏkch'ŏn (廣石川) is indeed not lacking in being one of Chosŏn's beautiful landscapes. <44>

**Summary**

This article describes Haeju, the capital of Hwanghae-do, in 1920. It highlights the city's population, the industrious and intelligent nature of its people, comparing their commercial acumen to that of Kaesŏng merchants. It mentions local products like ink and dye. The core of the article explains Haeju's motto: "Many People, Many Words, Many Stones." "Many People" refers to notable figures from Haeju, including ancient exemplars of filial piety (Soryŏn, Taeryŏn) and contemporary figures like "Righteous Man An" (An Chunggŭn) and "Dr. Yi" (Syngman Rhee). "Many Words" signifies a strong culture of public discourse and opinion. "Many Stones" refers to the abundance of construction stones and the scenic beauty of areas like Kwangsŏkch'ŏn. From a historical perspective, the article is interesting for its portrayal of local pride and identity in early colonial Korea. The explicit, positive mention of nationalist figures like An Chunggŭn (An ŭisa) and Syngman Rhee (Yi Paksa) in a publicly circulated magazine like *Kaebyŏk* in 1920 is particularly noteworthy, reflecting a period before censorship became extremely severe, and showcasing contemporary recognition of these individuals. The comparison with Kaesŏng and the reference to Chinese classics also situate Haeju within broader Korean and East Asian contexts.
