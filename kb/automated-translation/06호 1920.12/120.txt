庚申年의 거듬
						一記者
The year Kyŏngsin (庚申, 1920) was quite an eventful year, both for the world and for our Korea (朝鮮). Standing now at the peak of this year and looking back on its course, I cannot help but feel moved. I will now briefly note only the major events that occurred each month this year, just the facts, to express a sentiment of farewell. As the events from July onwards are particularly complex, I intend to continue this chronicle in the New Year issue.

January
Kyŏngsin year was the first year after the Great European War concluded and peace returned to the world, and the New Year atmosphere in January, the beginning of the year, was especially strong.
Peace Treaty Takes Effect
On the 6th, Germany signed the supplementary protocol to the peace treaty, bringing the treaty fully into effect. Simultaneously, Japan declared the restoration of peace on the 13th, and peace restoration celebration banquets were held within Korea and the mainland (内地, i.e., Japan).
Three Newspapers Permitted
On the 8th, the Tong-a Ilbo (東亞日報, Publisher Yi Sanghyŏp 李相協), Chosŏn Ilbo (朝鮮日報, Publisher Ye Chongsŏk 芮宗錫), and Sisa Sinmun (時事新聞, Publisher Yi Tongu 李東雨), whose applications were already pending with the authorities, were granted permission.
Current Fiscal Year Budget Announced
On the 10th, the Government-General's budget for Taishō 10 (1921) was announced. The total budget amount was 116,662,000+ yen. Compared to the Taishō 9 (1920) total budget of 77,560,000+ yen, this was truly an increase of 39,103,000+ yen. This was due to the expansion of police expenses related to suppressing the Korean independence movement that had arisen in various places at home and abroad since March 1st of last year, and the inclusion of new expenses required for the abolition of flogging (笞刑), expansion of education, etc. As measures to supplement these new expenses, tax rates for alcohol tax and tobacco consumption tax were raised.
Japan-US Cooperative Relationship Severed
From the 11th, the US troops stationed in Siberia—that is, the US troops dispatched jointly by Japan, Britain, and the US to rescue the Czech people stranded in Siberia and to check the power of the Russian Bolsheviks spreading to the Far East—began a simultaneous withdrawal from their stations. With this, the cooperative relationship between Japan and the US was severed.<60>
On the 17th, as French President Poincaré's term expired, Mr. Deschanel, speaker of the French lower house, was elected as the new president.
Korean History Research Society Emerges
On the 18th, the inaugural meeting of the Korean History Research Society (朝鮮古史硏究會) was held at Changch'un Hall (長春館) in Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul). Its content was about establishing a New Koryŏ state (新高麗國) in Manchuria. The head of this society was Chŏng Anrip (鄭安立), and behind it was the maneuvering of the Japanese rōnin, Suenaga Setsu (末永節). Looking at the society's prospectus, it stated, "Our divine ancestor Tan'gun (檀君) arose at the foot of Paektu Mountain (長白山) and established the country's name. Since then, the nation's power grew daily, and its territory encompassed south of the Xing'an Range (興安嶺), east of Shanhaiguan (山海關), and the Siberian Maritime Province, with a population calculated at 200 million. Today's Chinese territory of Manchuria and part of the Russian Maritime Province are regions where our ancestors lived. Thus, we now research this ancient history to plan for the revival of the Korean people (朝鮮民族)."
National Association Emerges
On the 18th, the inaugural meeting of the National Association (國民協會), advocating New Japanism (新日本主義), was held. The presidents were Min Wŏnsik (閔元植) and Kim Myŏngjun (金明溶), and the general affairs managers were Chŏng Pyŏngjo (鄭丙朝), Hwang Sŏkkyo (黃錫翹), and Kwŏn T'ae (權泰). A passage from its prospectus reads: "The merger of Japan and Korea is a fact of the past. Now, having united, we have become one country. Japan is no longer the Japan of old but a New Japan encompassing the land and people of Korea. In other words, it is not a Japan of only the Japanese people but a Japan of both the Japanese and Korean peoples. Standing on this fact and self-awareness, we aim to fulfill the great cause of coexistence between the Japanese and Korean peoples." This is the reason for the name New Japanism.
First Anniversary of the Late Great King Emeritus Yi's Death
The 22nd marked the anniversary of the passing of the late Great King Emeritus (故太王殿下, Emperor Kojong). A memorial service for the first anniversary was held inside Tŏksu Palace (德壽宮) at 10 AM that day. His Highness the Crown Prince (王世子殿下, Yi Un), who was in Tokyo, and His Highness Prince Yi Kang (李堈公殿下), who was in the city, both did not attend (Prince Yi Kang was unable to attend because he was not allowed freedom of movement due to the exposure of Chŏn Hyŏp (全協) and others' plan to escort him to Shanghai). The ceremony was quite desolate, and the citizens were particularly sorrowful.
Allied Supreme Council Dissolved
On the 21st, the Allied Supreme Council was dissolved. Prior to this, the Peace Conference had been dissolved with the establishment of the peace treaty with Germany, but the Supreme Council, composed of the prime ministers of Britain, France, Japan, and Italy, had remained. Following the completion of the signing of the peace treaty protocol, this too was dissolved, and henceforth the Council of Ambassadors stationed in France would take its place.
On the 25th, the inaugural meeting of the Great Eastern Literary Society (大東斯文會) was held at Myŏngwŏlgwan (明月館) in the city. Ŏ Yunch'ik (魚允廸), Chŏng Manjo (鄭萬朝), Hong Kŭnghyŏp (洪肯爕), Ch'oe Yŏngnyŏn (崔永年), and Kim Chŏnggi (金正基) were the main promoters. The society's purpose was to revive the Confucian morals and ritual systems of the old days to counter the new morals and new social systems currently burgeoning. Behind it was the Japanese president of the Kyŏngsŏng News Agency (京城通信), Ōgaki Takeo (大垣丈夫).
Preliminary Examination of Kang Ugyu Case Concluded
On the 29th, the preliminary examination concluded for Kang Ugyu (姜宇奎)—who shocked the world by bombing the entourage of the newly arriving <61> Governor-General Saitō at Namdaemun Station on August 1st of last year, causing injuries to over 20 people—and three others: Ch'oe Chanam (崔子南) from Wŏnsan, Hŏ Hyŏng (許 烔) from Anju, and O T'aeyŏng (吳泰泳), a student at the Severance Medical School (偲富蘭西醫專). The Kyŏngsŏng District Court issued a decision finding them guilty, and newspapers at home and abroad competed to report this. The public was astonished at the audacity and courage of the perpetrator. According to the written reasons for the guilty verdict in the preliminary examination: "Kang Ugyu was born in Tŏkch'ŏn County (德川郡), P'yŏngan South Province, and had an early foundation in Chinese classics. Around the age of 30, he moved to Hongwŏn (洪原), Hamgyŏng South Province, established a private school, and devoted himself to educating the children of the village. Witnessing the annexation of Korea by Japan in Meiji 43 (1910), he became greatly indignant, concluding that he could not live within Korea. The following year, he entered North Kando (北間島) and wandered through various places. In Taishō 6 (1917), he settled in his current address, Sinhŭng-dong (新興洞), Jaohe County (饒河縣), Jilin Province (吉林省), established the private Kwangdong School (光東學校), and engaged in education. During this time, he constantly desired Korean independence and instilled this ideology in the young students. Last year, on March 1st, hearing that Son Pyŏnghŭi (孫秉熙), Ch'oe Rin (崔麟), Yi Sŭnghun (李昇薰), and 33 others had risen up and declared Korean independence, he was greatly moved. He went to Sinhan Ch'on (新韓村) in Vladivostok, joined the Elders' Association (老人會) there, pledged to work for Korea, and engaged in propagating this cause. Meanwhile, hearing that despite Governor-General Hasegawa's resignation taking responsibility within Korea, a new Governor-General Saitō was arriving, he thought to himself: 'The previous Governor-General resigned having achieved nothing; what kind of person is this new Governor-General, and what prospects does he have that he dares to come? The arrival of the new Governor-General truly goes against the world trend of national self-determination, defies Heaven's will, ignores humanity, and is an enemy pushing 20 million people into dire straits. I shall risk my life to kill the new Governor-General, thereby expressing the fervent sincerity of the Korean people and securing recognition for Korean independence.' Having thus resolved to act, he purchased a bomb from a certain Russian at Ussuriysk Station on the Eastern Siberian line. He traveled afar from Vladivostok via Wŏnsan to Kyŏngsŏng and finally ambushed the Governor-General at Namdaemun Station." etc.

February
Instability on Kigensetsu
The 11th was Emperor Jinmu's National Foundation Day (神武天皇紀元節, Kigensetsu). Private schools in the city did not hold congratulatory ceremonies, citizens did not raise the national flag, and the authorities' security measures, fearing unforeseen events, were quite strict. The atmosphere in Kyŏngsŏng city was somewhat unstable.
On the 18th, the Kyŏngsŏng District Court delivered its verdict on the bomb perpetrators. Kang was sentenced to death, Ch'oe to 3 years in prison, Hŏ to 1 year and 6 months, and O to 1 year. They further appealed to the review court, and on the 26th, the verdict of the second trial was delivered. Kang, Ch'oe, and Hŏ received the same sentences as the first trial, while O T'aeyŏng was found not guilty.<62>

Japanese Diet Dissolved
On the [2]6th, the 43rd Imperial Japanese Diet was dissolved, and the House of Peers was suspended. Early in this Diet session, turmoil repeatedly arose in the House of Peers over the Yo Unhyŏng (呂運亨) issue, which was barely settled by Prime Minister Hara Kei's apology. In the House of Representatives, opposition parties submitted a universal suffrage bill. The implementation of this universal suffrage was truly a significant issue for Japan, arguably the first step towards realizing popular politics. The opposition parties and a great majority of the populace eagerly awaited the passage of this bill, staging fierce demonstrations outside the Diet. Not only that, but at this time, labor union strikes were widespread across Japan, making the situation quite noteworthy. Ultimately, the Hara cabinet decisively dissolved the Diet, causing a temporary surge in public opinion, but it soon calmed down.

March
The Situation on March First
March 1st of Kyŏngsin year, as everyone knows, was the day one full year ago when the first cry of the Korean independence movement was raised. Since March 1st of last year, despite the meticulous countermeasures of the police authorities, the movement had continued quite steadily. The thought that some kind of movement might erupt throughout Korea on March 1st was not limited to the authorities. Moreover, since February 25th or 26th, seditious documents about a "National Convention" (國民大會) were frequently distributed in Kyŏngsŏng city. As a countermeasure, the police authorities received reinforcements from provincial police, and a security force of over 1,000 officers conducted operational drills daily on Kwanghwamun Boulevard. From the evening of February 28th, the last day of February, this security force was divided into four units, guarding the city day and night. Notably, rifle squads composed of police officers were assigned to key locations. The effectiveness of such stringent security was not in vain; on March 1st itself, there were no major incidents. Market closures (撤市) were carried out in Kyŏngsŏng, Taegu, P'yŏngyang (where a Manse movement even occurred that day), and several other cities. Students at Paichai (培材) and Paehwa (培花) in Kyŏngsŏng, and Sungdŏk Third School (崇德第三學校) in P'yŏngyang shouted "Independence Manse" (獨立萬歲). This Manse incident was later investigated, and the provincial authorities revoked the employment permits for the principals of these three schools.
Army's Great Flight
On the 11th, an army airplane flying between Kyŏngsŏng and Tokorozawa landed at Yŏŭido, drawing the astonishment of the capital's populace. Prior to this, five aircraft had departed from Tokorozawa on the morning of the 8th, but two stopped flying midway. Of the three that crossed the Genkai Sea (玄海, Korea Strait), one made an emergency landing along the Naktong River (洛東江). Two landed safely in Taegu on the 10th, and then arrived in Kyŏngsŏng on the morning of the 11th (the flight time from Taegu to Kyŏngsŏng was 2 hours and 35 minutes).
German Revolution Erupts
On the night of the 13th, a revolution by the imperialist faction occurred in Germany. They occupied Berlin without bloodshed, and Dr. Kapp became Chancellor <64> became Chancellor. However, a few days later, the imperialist faction failed, and the Ebert cabinet resumed governance as before. Egypt declared independence. That is, 52 members of the Cairo legislative council met at the residence of the Nationalist Party leader, Pasha, opposed the British protectorate, and declared the independence of Egypt and the Sudan region.

April
Great Advance in the World of Journalism
The 1st. The Tong-a Ilbo and Sisa Sinmun, which received publication permits in January, were launched. Prior to this, the Chosŏn Ilbo and 2 or 3 magazines had also been launched, so the peninsula's world of journalism suddenly felt like ten thousand flowers blooming at once.
Company Law and Flogging Law Abolished
Also effective the same day, the ordinance abolishing the Flogging Law (笞刑令) and the Company Law (會社令) was promulgated. Flogging was truly an uncivilized punishment, applied only to Koreans, which had provoked public criticism; it was now abolished. The Company Law, established during the time of the previous Governor-General Terauchi, had been subject to much criticism and was now abolished. As a result, anyone whose business was legal and not harmful to the public interest could freely establish a company.
Ch'ŏndogyo's Anniversary Day
The 5th was the 61st anniversary (回甲日, hwangap) of the founding of the Ch'ŏndogyo Church (天道敎會). Several thousand followers of the religion gathered at the central headquarters and held a grand commemoration ceremony.
Great Disturbances Arise in Ireland
Great disturbances arose in Ireland. The Irish nationalist movement had a long history, becoming particularly intense after the end of the Great War. The Irish Sinn Féin party caused disturbances, attacking government offices and carrying out assassinations, making it seem as though Ireland would hardly see a peaceful day thereafter.
Korean History Research Society Dissolved
The Korean History Research Society, which held its inaugural meeting last January, was ordered dissolved by the Kyŏnggi Province Third Department (京畿 第3部) on the 9th, on the grounds that its advocacy of establishing a New Koryŏ was causing unpleasantness in Japan-China international relations.
P'yŏngyang Manse Movement Suddenly Erupts
On the afternoon of the 14th, a Manse disturbance suddenly erupted on Sŏdaemun Street (西大門通) in P'yŏngyang, causing citizens to temporarily close their shops, presenting a momentarily unstable situation.
Crown Prince's Wedding Ceremony
The 28th. The marriage between His Highness Crown Prince Yi Un (李王世子殿下), residing in Tokyo, and Her Highness Princess Nashimoto Masako (梨本宮方子女王殿下), which had been arranged three years prior but not performed due to the death of the Great King Emeritus (太王殿下) and other circumstances, took place with a wedding ceremony (燭典) at the Crown Prince's residence in Toriizaka, Tokyo. Concurrently, an amnesty and sentence reduction for Korean political prisoners were carried out by imperial decree. However, this was limited to political prisoners whose sentences had been finalized by the 28th, so it did not apply to Son Ŭiam (孫義庵, Son Pyŏnghŭi) and 47 others, nor to Kang Ugyu's group. On that day, about 540 people were released from prison in Kyŏngsŏng, among whom were <65> Unyŏng Kim Yunsik (雲養金允植) and Yi Yongsik (李容植), who were under suspension of execution. Prisoners released from various other regions continued to emerge, and at that time, the mountains and rivers of Korea seemed to drift away amidst the exchanged feelings of smiles and tears: "My dear child! My dear brother! Have you been well? Are you unharmed?"
Armed Group Invades Onsŏng
The 30th. The Police Affairs Bureau (警務局) announced the situation of an invasion of Onsŏng County (穩城郡) by an armed group of over 500 members from across the border. Apparently, the Manse disturbances of March last year suddenly influenced Koreans abroad. Korean organizations in Russia, China, and America each planned corresponding movements. Among them, restless Koreans (不穩鮮人) in West Kando (西間島) and North Kando (北間島) separately prepared weapons. An armed group of about 500, led by Ch'oe Myŏngnok (崔明祿) and Yang Hach'ŏng (梁河淸), invaded Onsŏng County 5 or 6 times since March 10th, engaging in battles with the garrison troops. According to the authorities' announcement, there were no casualties on either side.

May
Ch'oe Chaehyŏng Shot Dead
At the beginning of this month, news arrived of the execution by firing squad of Ch'oe Chaehyŏng (崔在亨) and three others. Ch'oe was the former Finance Minister of the Shanghai Provisional Government (上海假政府) and resided in Sinhan Ch'on, Vladivostok. When Japanese troops occupied Sinhan Ch'on due to an earlier clash with the Vladivostok military (海參威過軍), Ch'oe had fled to Nikolsk. He was arrested and executed this time.
Korean Students' Association
On the 9th, the founding general meeting of the Korean Students' Association (朝鮮學生大會) was held, with Ko Wŏnhun (高元勳), Chang Tŏksu (張德秀), Im Kyŏngjae (任璟宰), and others as sponsoring members.
Hamgyŏng Line Opening Ceremony
On the 16th, the opening ceremony for the Wŏnsan-Hamhŭng section of the Hamgyŏng Line railway was held.
Italian Aircraft Arrive in Korea
On the afternoon of the 23rd, an Italian airplane landed at Yŏŭido, Kyŏngsŏng. This flight started far away in Rome, taking 104 days, costing 1.5 million yen, covering 33,000 li (approx. 13,000 km) through the air. Lieutenants Ferrarin and Masiero appeared in Kyŏngsŏng on this day. The two lieutenants headed for Japan via Taegu on the 28th.
Kang Ugyu's Death Sentence Confirmed
On the 27th, Kang Ugyu's appeal was dismissed by the High Court, and his death sentence was confirmed. He left a will for his son, Chunggŏn (重建), reiterating his request regarding the education of Korean youth. The number of schools he personally founded throughout Korea and abroad reached six.
The 31st. Governor-General Saitō, who had gone to Tokyo for the Crown Prince's wedding ceremony last month, returned to his post. Also on the same day, the verdict for the famous Suwŏn Incident (水原事件) was delivered at the Kyŏngsŏng District Court. Hong * (洪 *), Wang Kwangyŏn (王光演), Hong *ok (洪*玉), and Mun Sangik (文相翊) were each sentenced to 12 years imprisonment. Kim Myŏngje (金明濟) and 17 others received sentences of 10 years or less. Although they later appealed or made final appeals, the outcome ultimately remained the same as the initial trial. A peculiar <66> phenomenon this month was
The Rise of Numerous New Religions
namely Ch'ŏngnimgyo (靑林), Chesegyo (濟世), T'aeŭlgyo (太乙), Samsŏng Mugŭkkyo (三聖無極), T'ongch'ŏn'gyo (統天), Cheugyo (濟愚), Sungsillin Chohap (崇神人組合), etc., mostly emerged rapidly during this month. Among these new religions, some had existed as latent forces among the populace for some time and simply emerged publicly amidst the trend of forming associations. Others were founded like ordinary companies by a few individuals. In any case, amidst this somewhat strange phenomenon, the most noteworthy was the so-called Sungsillin Chohap (Association of God-Worshipping People). Initially, a Japanese named Komine Gensaku (小峯源作), seeing the growing influence of Ch'ŏndogyo in recent years and its increasing proselytization efforts everywhere, attempted to split the church. He tried to revive Chesegyo, which shared the first-generation founder with Ch'ŏndogyo, and promote it heavily, but it had little effect. Therefore, he further tried to utilize T'aeŭlgyo and Chehwagyo (濟化敎) but also failed. As a last resort, he connected with the traditionally shamanistic factions (妖魔한 巫黨派) and finally established the Sungsillin Chohap. The shaman factions, which until now had been suppressed by police crackdowns and unable to raise their heads, saw this as an opportunity. In several places in Kyŏngsŏng, signboards reading "Sungsillin Chohap Ch'isŏngdang" (崇神人組合 致誠堂, Sungsillin Association Prayer Hall) were hung, and they openly performed their rituals (꿍덩실거리는 樣이다).

June
Patriotic Women's Association Case Verdict
On the 7th, the Taegu District Court delivered the verdict in the case of the Korean Youth Diplomatic Corps (大韓靑年外交團) and the Korean Patriotic Women's Association (大韓愛國婦人會). The association executives An Chaehong (安在鴻), Kim Mariya (金瑪利亞), and Paek Sinyŏng (白信永) were each sentenced to 3 years imprisonment.
On the 12th, as Son Ŭiam's (孫義庵, Son Pyŏnghŭi) illness worsened, rumors of his release on bail circulated widely but did not materialize. Furthermore, on the same day, welcome rain fell heavily amidst the drought that had persisted since spring.
On the 18th, an organization called the Korean People's Association (朝鮮民團) was founded.
On the 20th, the Buddhist Youth Association (佛敎靑年會) emerged. Prior to this, the issue of Buddhist sect conversion (改宗問題) arose, becoming a topic of public discussion. While the true inner details are not fully known, Yi Hoegwang (李晦光), one of the advocates for Korean Buddhist reform, colluded with the Japanese monk Gotō Zuigan (後藤瑞岩) to affiliate Korean Buddhism with the Myōshin-ji Rinzai sect (妙心寺 臨濟宗派) of Japan. However, opposition arose from all 6,000 monks across Korea, and the plan failed midway. It seemed to the public that the Buddhist Youth Association emerged partly in opposition to such events.
Kaebyŏk Magazine Launched
On the 15th, the first issue of Kaebyŏk (開闢) magazine was launched.
Korean Education Association Founded
On the 26th, the founding general meeting of the Korean Education Association (朝鮮敎育會) was held at the home of Mr. Yun Ch'iso (尹致昭) in Kyŏngsŏng. The president was Yi Sangjae (李商在), vice president Kim Samok (金思黙), directors Yu Chint'ae (兪鎭泰) and 14 others, councilors Chang Hun (張薰), Yu Sŏngjun (兪星濬), Kim Sayong (金思容) and 19 others. It encompassed almost <67> all influential figures in the education world. Its admirable goal was to solve our current educational problems socially. The public had high hopes for it, while earnestly wishing the association would not end up being merely nominal.
Return of Hyanggyo Property
On the 29th, the revision of the Hyanggyo Property Management Ordinance regulations was announced by the Government-General, causing Confucian scholars (儒生) to be utterly overjoyed. Originally, the annual income from Hyanggyo (鄕校, traditional Confucian schools) property reached the enormous sum of over 260,000 yen. Until now, 177,000+ yen of this had been allocated to the expenses of public common schools (公立普通學校) in various regions. With the revision of the regulations this time, the entire amount could be used for Hyanggyo expenses. The reason given for the revision was: "Now, with the influx of many foreign ideologies into Korea, old morals are collapsing, and human relations are loosening. At this juncture, we attempt to harmonize new and old morals by supporting Confucianism, the foundation of Eastern morality." However, regardless of the reason, the intellectual class expressed disapproval of the return of Hyanggyo property. At the time, the Tong-a Ilbo commented in its editorial: "Returning even the portion previously used for school expenses to specifically guarantee Confucian rituals, thereby treating Confucianism like a state religion, contradicts the spirit of universal legislation ensuring freedom of belief. Furthermore, it hinders the enlightenment movement by enclosing Korean society, which is supposed to be progressing."
Student Strikes (Alliance School Closures)
From the beginning of the month, allied school closure movements (同盟休校運動) by students of various private schools—namely Hwimun (徽文), Yangjŏng (養正), and Yŏnhŭi (延禧) schools in Kyŏngsŏng, Sungsil (崇實) in P'yŏngyang, and Sinsŏng (信聖) School in Sŏnch'ŏn (宣川), P'yŏngan North Province—occurred successively, becoming a public issue. This was because the awakening of the general Korean populace since last year had become remarkably evident, exemplified by the surge in enthusiasm for education. Student numbers in various schools increased unprecedentedly, but the school authorities' new facilities did not keep pace, eventually leading to dissatisfaction among the general student body and provoking such movements.<68>

**Summary**

This article from the December 1920 issue of *Kaebyŏk* magazine chronicles major events in Korea and the world during the first half of 1920 (January-June). It covers the formal end of WWI, the permission granted to new Korean newspapers (Tong-a Ilbo, Chosŏn Ilbo), the increased colonial budget for suppressing independence activities, the trial and sentencing of Kang Ugyu for the bombing attempt on Governor-General Saitō, the abolition of the Company Law and flogging, the Crown Prince's marriage and subsequent amnesty (which excluded key figures), the founding of various pro-Japanese and nationalist/cultural organizations (like the Korean History Research Society, National Association, Daedong Samunhui, Korean Education Association), the emergence of new religious movements, border skirmishes involving armed Korean groups, and widespread student strikes demanding better educational facilities. The report highlights the tense atmosphere surrounding the first anniversary of the March 1st Movement and ongoing Japanese efforts to control Korean society through security measures, co-option (e.g., National Association, Sungsillin Chohap), and policy changes (e.g., Hyanggyo property). For historians, the article offers a contemporary perspective on the immediate aftermath of the March 1st Movement, showcasing the diverse Korean responses ranging from armed resistance and political organization to cultural and educational initiatives, alongside the evolving strategies of Japanese colonial rule and the infiltration attempts by Japanese actors into Korean cultural and religious spheres. The detailed accounts of specific events, organizations, and individuals provide valuable data points for understanding this critical period.
