感吟 六絶, 漢詩
						芝江遺稿
一
Midday, children clamor in the old market,
High wind, a crane stands on green moss.
The old man always eats plain white food,
House servant, do not buy sour or salty things.

二
Distantly imagining peeking into the quietude of Langji (閬寂),
Empty body, during the day, maintains solemnity (莊嚴).
The old man passes days and months before the plum blossoms,
Leisurely, retreating, humble.

三
Though there are countless empty bodies (空身),
True virtue (眞德) is fundamentally not two or three.
Turning my head, I wish to ascend to the ancient realm (古境),
White gulls, green grass, south of the river (江南).

四
Men of ambition often grow white hair,
Lofty persons do not die for gold.
My friend now resides north of the city wall (北郭),
Quickly take the orchid pipe (蘭管) as your bosom companion (衿).

五
A pure heart like a crane passing through the autumn sky (秋旻),
A harmonious sound like a dove cooing on a spring day.
You possess lifelong self-reliance (平生自衛),
What need is there to seek in the house of Mengchang (孟嘗)?

六
Flowers move, birds move, people grow old,
One star, two stars, ten thousand lamps.
The river's light seems to wash the mist clean,
The yellow canopy (黃屋) slowly passes Baideng (白登).

七
The servant says fish appear in the sea market [mirage],
The child reports a deer sleeps by the mountain gate (山扃).
Deep in the middle of the night, seeing the moon,
The plan for the golden elixir (金丹) lies in health and peace (康寧).

八
In early spring, vainly pursuing the profound mystery (玄乙),
In middle age, often ashamed of being a commoner (白丁).
Moon bright over the river, hearing a flute,
My friend should be attending the imperial court (帝庭).

九
The multitude of dust like encountering a thousand armored soldiers,
A small hand finds it hard to grasp even one soldier (一丁).
A narrow path leads into the mountains late,
Children explain the Huangting (黃庭).<76>

**Summary**

This collection of nine Hanja quatrains, titled "Inspired Recitations," presents the reflections of an aging scholar, possibly under the pen name "Chigang" (芝江遺稿, Posthumous Manuscripts of Chigang). The poems explore themes of detachment from worldly concerns (simple living, rejecting ambition and patronage), appreciation for nature's tranquility (cranes, plum blossoms, gulls, moon), and philosophical contemplation drawing from Daoist and possibly Buddhist ideas (empty body, true virtue, golden elixir, Huangting scripture). There's a sense of resignation to aging and perhaps a longing for connection or a different path (mention of a friend at court). Published in *Kaebyŏk* in 1920, during Japanese rule, the poems offer historians insight into the inner life of traditional Korean intellectuals of the era. The focus on classical themes, nature, and spiritual detachment could represent a form of inner resistance or solace found in tradition and philosophy amidst the political constraints and cultural shifts of the colonial period. The reference to the imperial carriage passing Baideng, a site of historical difficulty for a Han emperor, might hold subtle contemporary resonance.

感吟 六絶, 漢詩
						芝江遺稿
一
中晝兒喧古市, 高風鶴立蒼苔. 翁也常啖白素, 家僮莫沽酸醎.

二
遠想朝窺閬寂, 空身晝執莊嚴. 翁在梅前日月, 悠悠退退謙謙.

三
空身雖有千億, 眞德元無二三. 回首欲登古境, 白鷗靑草江南.

四
志士多生白髮, 高人不死黃金. 我友今居北郭, 早將蘭管爲衿.

五
淨意秋旻過鶴, 和音春晝鳴鳩. 君有平生自衛, 孟嘗家裏何求.

六
花行鳥行人老, 一星二星萬燈. 江光若洗烟淨, 黃屋徐過白登.

七
僮說魚登海市, 兒傳鹿宿山扃. 中夜深深見月, 金丹計在康寧.

八
上春空逐玄乙, 中歲多慚白丁. 月明江上聞笛, 我友應朝帝庭.

九
衆塵如遇千甲, 小手難擒一丁. 細路通山晩入, 兒童解說黃庭.＜76＞
