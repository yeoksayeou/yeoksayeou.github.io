Rope Thief

In a certain prison (監獄), a criminal, let's call him A, was newly incarcerated. Prisoner B, who was in the same cell, asked him:

B: For what crime did you end up like this?

A: Eh—I was just guilty of stealing one rope (노이).

B: Hey, that's truly excessive! What kind of rope?

A: A three-ply rope made of straw (藁草).

B: Hey you, isn't that a lie? Just for a worthless straw rope like that...

A: No, it's not. When I looked next, at the end of that rope, there happened to be one head of cattle (牛) attached.

Even a thief feels a bit ashamed for others to know their own wrongdoing. <21>

**Summary**

A new prisoner claims he was jailed merely for stealing a worthless straw rope. When pressed by his cellmate who finds the punishment excessive for such a minor item, the prisoner reveals that a cow happened to be attached to the end of the rope. The piece is a short, humorous anecdote illustrating how people tend to minimize their faults. For historians, this brief text offers a glimpse into the everyday language (including older spellings like '노이', '업는', '맨든', '끄테', '달렷습디다') and humor present in colonial Korea, potentially reflecting subtle social commentary on crime or justification within the context of imprisonment during that era.
