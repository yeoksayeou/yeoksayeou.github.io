Things to Prioritize in the Economic Sphere

First. To mutually encourage frugality. Even when lighting a single 'Kalpyo' brand cigarette or wearing a Western-style suit, one must deeply consider at that moment whether it was made by our own hands or imported from another country. Remembering that because each of us acts this way, Chosŏn's import surplus reaches fifty million won annually, we must favor domestically produced goods as much as possible. While this is undoubtedly a passive measure and may cause us some inconvenience, for us who are in an industrial transition period, we cannot help but do this first. And this should begin first from the side of various organizations.

Second. Chosŏn-produced export goods should, as much as possible, pass through the hands of Koreans. Looking at the current situation, even for export trade items that are purely Chosŏn-produced, Koreans merely receive a low price for the raw product at the source. Refining and processing these to export them abroad at a considerable value is mostly done by the hands of foreigners. To take one example, even looking at rice, Chosŏn's sole export product, the majority of rice is sold at the production site as unhulled paddy for just a few pennies. Those who profit by turning it into brown or polished rice and handling the final export are not Koreans. Therefore, from now on, we must strive hard so that the majority of Chosŏn products pass through Korean hands until the very end, thereby retaining the profits entirely.

Third. Schools from middle school upwards should establish affiliated factories to provide students working their way through school (苦學) with the means to study, while simultaneously allowing them to experience how enjoyable it is to actively produce something. <12>

Fourth. In each agricultural village, producer cooperatives should be encouraged to substantively improve the economic situation of the rural areas.

Fifth. Each capitalist should establish manufacturing companies to first produce current daily necessities (or substitutes for certain imported goods, or uniquely Chosŏn products), without thinking of making a profit from it for some time, considering the funds as contributed to charitable work. The general Korean populace should use these products even if they are the same price or seem slightly inferior, with producers and consumers adopting an attitude of mutual concession.

Sixth. Various religious groups, companies, and youth organizations should hold periodic economic lectures for their members or the general public to awaken economic consciousness.

Seventh. Standing in the market of free competition, one must constantly observe due to what deficiencies the work done by Koreans falls short of that done by others.

Eighth. Organizations like youth associations in various regions must add a 'Business Department' (實業部), just as they must establish an Intellectual Education Department and a Physical Education Department.

Ninth. When it comes to implementing general economic production or economic propaganda, one must endeavor not to act out of mere jealousy and exclusion towards foreigners or foreign goods. This is because our effort to strive economically does not stem from the emotion of wanting to fatten ourselves by stripping others of their livelihood, but rather springs from the reason of wanting to develop what we have so that 'we and others' (人我) can coexist and co-prosper. Furthermore, free competition in the market cannot be forcibly controlled. The only issue is for us to fundamentally awaken ourselves and, with true intention and true heart, stand in the free market, building solid, pearl-like crystallizations in deeds rather than words, both in large matters and small. If we do so, then within a shorter time than generally expected today, in the joy of realizing it is relatively easy, our economic world too will hopefully reach a desirable state. <13>

**Summary**

This editorial outlines a nine-point plan for the economic revitalization of Korea (Chosŏn) under colonial constraints. It advocates for austerity, prioritizing Korean-made goods, ensuring Korean control over production and export processes (especially for key commodities like rice), integrating vocational training in schools, establishing agricultural cooperatives, encouraging Korean capitalists to invest in manufacturing basic goods (initially without profit motive), promoting economic education, critically analyzing shortcomings in free market competition, adding business departments to youth groups, and pursuing economic development based on rational self-improvement and coexistence rather than simply excluding foreigners. The article is significant for revealing Korean nationalist economic strategies during the colonial period, emphasizing self-reliance, industrial development, and cooperative organization as paths toward strengthening the Korean economy and society despite political limitations. Historians would find the blend of practical economic advice (promoting domestic goods, cooperatives, manufacturing) with underlying nationalist sentiment and the careful navigation of rhetoric around 'foreigners' within the colonial context particularly interesting.

經濟方面으로 爲先할 일은
第一. 儉素를 相勸할 일. 칼표 卷烟 한 개를 부티고 洋木周衣 한 벌을 입을지라도 입을 그때에는 반듯이 이것이 우리의 손으로 된 것이냐 或은 他國으로부터 輸入된 것인가를 深思하고 우리 各自가 모다 이리하는 까닭으로 朝鮮의 輸入超過가 年五千萬圓에 至함을 銘記하야 될 수 잇는대로 自家産品을 愛用하여야 할지니 此는 勿論 消極的 計策인 同時에 우리 스스로 不便한 點도 잇슬 것이나 産業上 過渡期에 在한 우리로서는 爲先 이러하지 아흘 수 업스며 그리고 이것은 먼저 各團軆 側으로부터 始行할 것이다.
第二. 朝鮮産 輸出品은 할 수 잇는 대로 朝鮮人의 手를 經過케 할 것. 今日 形便으로 보면 輸出貿易品 中 純朝鮮産일지라도 朝鮮人은 겨우 産地에서 原品으로의 低價를 取할 뿐이요. 此에 精製加工하야 相當한 價額으로써 外國에 輸出하기는 大槪 外人의 手에 由한다. 一例를 擧하면 朝鮮 唯一의 輸出品인 米를 보아도 米의 大部는 本産地에서 租 그대로 몃 푼 돈을 取할 뿐이요. 玄米精米로 化하야 最後의 輸出까지 하야 利를 得하는 者는 朝鮮人은 아니다. 그러니까 自今으로는 朝鮮産品의 大部는 最後까지 朝鮮人의 手를 經하도록 奮勉하야 그 利益을 全혀 有하여야 할 것이다.
第三. 中學校 以上 學校에는 附屬工場을 設하도록 하야 苦學에게 修學의 便을 與하는 同時에 積極的으로 或 物을 生産함이 어떠케 滋味잇는 것인가를 體驗케 할 일.＜12＞
第四. 各農村에는 生産組合을 獎勵하야 農村의 經濟界를 實質로써 向上케 할 일.
第五. 各資産家는 製造會社를 起하야 爲先 現下의 日用品(或은 輸入品 中 或 品의 代用品, 又는 朝鮮 固有의 産品 等)을 製出하되 얼마동안은 그로써 利益 볼 생각을 말고 그 資金으로 慈善事業에 供한 셈 칠지며 朝鮮人 一般은 同價이면 아니 좀 못한 듯 할지라도 그것을 使用하야 生産者 需要者가 相讓의 態를 取할 일.
第六. 各宗敎 側, 各會社, 各靑年團體에서는 그 會員 又는 一般의 時時로 經濟的 講演을 行하야 經濟觀念을 喚起할 일.
第七. 自由競爭의 市場에 立하야 어떠한 不足으로 因하야 朝鮮人의 하는 일이 다른 사람에 不及하는가를 恒常 注視할 일.
第八. 各地 靑年會와 如한 團體에서는 智育部 體育部를 必置함과 如히 實業部라는 一部를 必加할 일.
第九. 一般의 經濟的 生産 或은 經濟的 宣傳을 實行함에 至하야는 한갓 外人 或은 外貨를 嫉妬排除하는 態에 出치 말기를 期할지니 是는 우리가 經濟的으로 努力하자 함은 人의 生을 剝하야써 我의 生을 肥코저 하는 感情에서 出함이 아니요. 我의 有를 發揮하야 人我가 共存共榮하자는 理性에서 發하는 것일세며 且 市場의 自由競爭은 억지로 左右할 수 업는 故이라. 다못 問題는 우리가 根本的으로 自覺하야 또 참뜻 참마음으로써 自由市場에 立하야 큰 것에와 가티 또 적은 대에서 말보다도 行에서 眞珠가티 토실토실한 結晶을 지을 것뿐이다. 그리하면 今日 一般의 豫想하는 것보다도 좀 가까운 時日안에 比較的 쉽도다 하는 喜悅 裡에 우리의 經濟界도 庶幾할 것이다.＜13＞
