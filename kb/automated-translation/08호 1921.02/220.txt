Is It Brown Rice or White Rice?

There was a lazy tenant farmer (小作人) who absolutely hated working. Nevertheless, his wife (妻子) and children asked for clothes and food, and he too needed to eat and dress. But he truly hated breaking a sweat to get that food and clothing. After thinking long and hard (百爾思之), one day (一日) he went to his close friend (親友) and said:

Lazybones (懶漢): Hey, friend, I really hate living. Don't argue this way or that, just do me this final favor (精) and get me a coffin.

Friend: What do you need a coffin for?

Lazybones: I told you not to argue, just get it for me.

So, the friend, as requested, got him a coffin. The lazybones promptly got into the coffin and lay down.

Lazybones: Now it's done. Friend, just bury me like this. If you do that, all will be peaceful (萬事太平). I absolutely hate working, but I still have to eat and dress. How can a person live like this?

Friend: What are you talking about?

Lazybones: I told you not to complain. Hey, isn't this my final wish (最後의 所願)?

The friend, having no choice—perhaps because he was such a lazybones' friend, he felt the same way (同感)—hoisted the coffin (with the lazybones sitting inside) onto his shoulder and went looking for soft ground (사태밥, a place easy to dig), intending to bury him. However, on the way (中路), they met the lazybones' landlord (밧主人). The landlord thought the coffin was very strange (異常) and asked, "Hey, what is that?" The friend replied, "It's So-and-so who works under you (幕下), and such-and-such happened..." Upon hearing the situation (事情), the landlord said, "A person has to live to see another day, how can this be? I'll send ten *mal* of rice tomorrow, so don't do this."

At this moment, the lazybones, from inside the coffin, asked astonishingly:

"Well then, Master (主人님), is the rice you're giving brown rice (玄米) or white rice (白米)?..."

If it's brown rice (玄米), who would polish it? That must be what he meant. A lazybones, indeed, a famous (有名) lazybones. <93>

**Summary**

This short, humorous piece tells the story of an incredibly lazy tenant farmer who decides he'd rather be buried alive than work. He gets in a coffin and asks his friend to bury him. On the way to find a burial spot, they encounter the farmer's landlord who, upon hearing the story, promises ten *mal* of rice to convince the farmer to live. Even from within the coffin, the farmer's immediate concern is whether the rice is brown or white, as polishing brown rice would still constitute work he wishes to avoid. The story uses hyperbole to critique extreme laziness. For historians, it offers a glimpse into colonial-era Korean society through its depiction of tenant farmer-landlord relationships (小作人, 밧主人), the hardships driving despair (though presented humorously), and perhaps commentary on the labor involved even in basic sustenance (玄米 vs. 白米). The use of Hanja terms like 懶漢 highlights the literary style of the time.

그것 玄米인가 精米인가
게을음장이 小作人 하나가 잇는데 일하기는 딱 실코 그래도 妻子는 옷 달라 밥 달라 하며 저도 또 입고 먹어야 하겟고 그래도 그 옷 밥 엇기 爲하야 땀 흘리기는 정말 실코 百爾思之한 결과, 一日은 自己의 親友를 向하야
懶漢，여보게 나는 딱 살기가 실흐네. 이러니 저러니 군말 말고 그대에게 對한 最後의 精이니 널통 하나만 求하야 주게.
親友, 널통은 하야 무엇하게.
懶漢, 이러니 저러니 군말 말라니까 求하야만 주게나.
그래서 그 親友는 말대로 널통을 求하야 준 즉 懶漢은 성큼 그 통속에 들어가 누으며
懶漢, 이제는 되엇네. 자네가 이대로 무더만 주게. 그리만하면 萬事太平이겟다. 일하기는 딱실코 그러나 먹고 또 입기는 하여야 되겟고 사람 살 수가 잇나.
親友, 그것 무슨 말이냐.
懶漢, 군소리 말라니까. 여보게 나의 最後의 所願이 아닌가.
그 親友는 할 수 업시 그러한 懶漢의 親友인 즉 그 亦 同感이던 樣인지 널통(懶漢 들어 안즌)을 둘러메고 사태밥을(파기 조흔 곳) 차자 간다. 무더 둘 作定으로. 그런데 가다가 中路에서 懶漢의 밧主人을 맛낫다. 밧主人은 그 널통이 하도 異常하게 생각되어 『여보 그것 무엇이오』 무른 즉 그 親友는 『당신 幕下에 잇는 某가 若是若是하야...』 이라 答하얏다. 이 事情을 들은 밧主人은 『사람이 살고 보아야지 그것 될 인가. 내 來日 쌀 열말만 보낼터이니 그리 말도록 하시오』 하얏다.
이때에 그 懶漢은 널통 속으로서 놀랄만하게 反問하는 말이
『그러면 主人님 그 주신다는 쌀이 玄米입니까 白米입니까...』
玄米이면 그것을 누가 또 쓸겟느냐 하는 말이겟지. 懶漢인즉 有名한 懶漢이다.＜93＞
