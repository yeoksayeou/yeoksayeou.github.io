The Full Story of This Magazine's Censorship Incident

That this magazine, having published its first issue under the name of a special issue last June, has reached today without major incident is entirely due to the earnest guidance of esteemed figures in society and the warm support of many brethren far and wide (江湖). Aware of this, our company recognizes that our duty towards our brethren compatriots grows heavier as the issues increase and the years pass. While we have been worrying day and night (夙夜憂懼), fearing only our inadequacy (不及), unexpectedly last December (客臘), the issue of this magazine's censorship incident (筆禍) arose. That public opinion, high and low, was stirred by this, and readers near and far became worried, leaves us unsure of what words we should offer.

To briefly outline the facts of the matter: On December 28th of last year, the publisher of this magazine, Yi Tu-sŏng (李斗星), was summoned (呼出) by the Tongdaemun Police Station (東大門 警察署). An investigation (取調) was conducted based on the purport (旨) that "Regarding the magazine *Kaebyŏk* (開闢雜誌), its writing style has been recognized as considerably subversive (不穩) since the first issue, and despite receiving repeated notices and warnings from the authorities, certain passages (某某節) in the article titled 'Demands for Youth Groups Everywhere' (各地 靑年團體에 對한 要求) in issue No. 6, published December 1st, are purely related to current affairs issues and, at the same time, are not without suspicion (嫌) of hindering (妨한) public security (治安)." The next day, the 29th, Publisher Yi was summoned again, and it was declared that "The recent article in *Kaebyŏk* falls under Article 26 of the Newspaper Law (新聞紙法) (Said article states: In cases where matters disrupting social order or public morals (社會의 秩序 又는 風俗을 壞亂) are published (記載한 境遇), the publisher and editor shall be sentenced (處함) to imprisonment with labor (懲役) for up to ten months or a fine (罰金) between fifty and three hundred won)," and he was sentenced to a fine of fifty won through summary disposition (即決處分). Mr. Yi retorted (反問), "Which passage in the article of issue No. 6 constitutes a matter disrupting social order or public morals?" and immediately expressed non-compliance (不服). Then, on the following day, the 30th, the publisher was summoned again by the same station, and it was stated that the sentence (言渡) pronounced yesterday was mistaken, and now, according to Article 30 of the Newspaper Law (新聞紙法) (Formerly omitted section, or: In cases where a newspaper that has not paid (納附치 아니한) the security deposit (保證金) publishes (揭載한 境遇) articles other than those concerning matters listed in Article 5 (scholarly arts and literature - 學術文藝), the publisher shall be sentenced to a fine between forty and one hundred won), a fine of fifty won was pronounced via summary judgment. Mr. Yi likewise (亦是) expressed non-compliance and requested (請求) a formal trial (裁判), and thus a public trial (公判) was set to open at the Kyŏngsŏng District Court (京城地方法院) on January 24th last.

However, as news of this spread throughout society via newspapers, and public opinion (輿論) regarding this arose among various classes (階級), five gentlemen who have long been influential figures (重鎭) in the legal community (辯護士界) and have always striven (意を致하던) for the defense (擁護) of human rights and freedom of speech—Chang To (張燾), Pak Sŭng-bin (朴勝彬), Kim Ch'an-yŏng (金瓚永), Yi Ki-ch'an (李基燦), and Yi Sŭng-u (李升雨)—expressed particular sympathy for our company's current incident. Regardless of the eventual victory or defeat (勝負 如何), they decided, first of all (爲先), to take over (引受) the entire case (該事件). Consequently (듸디어), the trial date was postponed (延期), and the public trial is now scheduled to open between February 4th and 5th (tentatively - 姑未確定). While the final outcome (結局 如何) of this incident cannot be predicted (逆知키 不能), we express our gratitude, along with our over ten thousand (萬餘) readers, to everyone who offers their pure (깨끗한) sympathy for our company. Furthermore (尙且), we take this opportunity (機會) to state once more (一言) that our company intends only to redouble (一段의 努力을 更加하야) its efforts henceforth and do its utmost (最善을 一盡하고저 할 뿐) for the great mission (使命) that is *Kaebyŏk*. <148>

**Summary**

The editors of *Kaebyŏk* magazine inform readers about legal trouble ("penal servitude incident") arising from their December 1st, Issue No. 6 article, "Demands for Youth Groups Everywhere." Publisher Yi Tu-sŏng was summoned by Tongdaemun Police, initially accused under Newspaper Law Article 26 (disturbing social order/morals), fined 50 won, and refused to comply. The charge was changed the next day to Article 30 (publishing non-academic content without paying a security deposit), with the same fine. Yi again refused and requested a formal trial, scheduled for Jan 24th at Kyŏngsŏng District Court. Five prominent lawyers (Chang To, Pak Sŭng-bin, Kim Ch'an-yŏng, Yi Ki-ch'an, Yi Sŭng-u) offered pro bono support, leading to a postponement until Feb 4th or 5th. The editors express gratitude for reader support and pledge continued effort. This article provides a valuable first-hand account of the mechanisms of Japanese colonial censorship, the specific legal articles used (Newspaper Law Arts. 26 & 30), the arbitrary nature of charges (changing from disturbing order to a financial/procedural violation), and the resistance shown by the publisher and the support network (lawyers) that emerged within colonial society to challenge these measures. Historians can gain insight into the legal tactics used to suppress Korean publications and the ways Koreans navigated and contested the colonial legal system.
