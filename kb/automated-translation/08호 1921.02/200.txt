爲之不厭, 誨人不倦=孔子

When we think of Confucius! (孔子), we ordinary people simply think of him as someone who became great just like that. That is, we recognize him as a sage who was 'born knowing' (生而知之). This is truly a misconception that will lead to great trouble; the fact that we, over a thousand years after Confucius, have shriveled up into this state is entirely due to such a misjudgment. Evidence is better than argument—let us now cite the Master's desperate cries:
He said, "At fifteen, I set my heart on learning; at thirty, I stood firm; at forty, I had no doubts; at fifty, I knew the mandate of Heaven; at sixty, my ear was obedient; at seventy, I could follow my heart's desire without transgressing."
He said, "In a hamlet of ten households, there are surely those as loyal and trustworthy as Qiu (丘 - Confucius's given name), but none who love learning as much as Qiu."
He said, "Sagehood and benevolence—how could I dare claim them? Yet, I strive tirelessly and teach without weariness, that is all."
He said, "To learn silently and remember, to study without satiety, and to teach without wearying—what difficulty are these things to me?"
He said, "Failure to cultivate virtue, failure to discuss learning, inability to move toward righteousness upon hearing it, inability to correct what is not good—these are my worries."
He said, "To ponder all day without eating and all night without sleeping yields no benefit; it is better to learn."
He said, "There are three paths of the noble person, of which I have mastered none: The benevolent are free from worry, the wise from doubt, the courageous from fear."
He said, "No one knows me! I do not resent Heaven, nor blame humanity. I study the lower things and penetrate the higher. Perhaps only Heaven knows me."
The Master was truly an unparalleled man of energy, a seeker, and a man of action. Just as Lincoln idealized Washington, he single-mindedly idealized the Duke of Zhou (周公). Therefore, before embodying the Duke of Zhou's generosity (布施), he first learned the Duke of Zhou's spirit of spitting out food and grasping his hair [to receive visitors] (吐哺握髮), staying up all night awaiting dawn (達夜待旦)—no, that fervent spirit, saying, "Strive tirelessly (爲之不厭)," "All day without eating (終日不食)," "Study the lower to attain the higher (下學而上達)," "Binding cords breaking three times" (韋編三絶)! Truly, what a man of energy he was. <85> Saying, "What difficulty are these to me? (何有於我哉)," "These are my worries (是吾憂也)," "I have mastered none (吾無能一焉)!" Truly, what a seeker he was. Saying, "For three months, I did not know the taste of meat (三月不知肉味) (Upon hearing the Shao music in Qi)," "I did not realize old age was coming (不知老之將至)!" Truly, what a devoted practitioner (篤行者) he was. To foolishly misunderstand such a person as just some Yangban who was 'born knowing'. Truly, if the Master heard this, he would be dumbfounded. Do not take this as mere rhetoric. Confucius was not, in fact, a Confucius made so cheaply.

When thinking of Confucius! some people consider him merely a decorous Yangban who went with the flow of the times (yes-yes-ing; 네-네-) and lived like a spineless creature (無骨蟲). If Confucius had been like that, he would truly be, let alone a dog of a mourning house (喪家의 狗), worse than a detective's dog—no, a singular, contemptible man like a blowfly (개파리). Fortunately, Confucius was not that kind of Yangban.
He said, "When the state has the Way (道), it is shameful to receive a salary [without merit]; when the state lacks the Way, receiving a salary is [also] shameful." (邦有道, 穀恥也, 邦無道에 穀이 恥也.)
He said, "Repay grievance with directness, repay virtue with virtue." (以直報怨, 以德報德.)
He said, "If I hear the Way in the morning, I can die content in the evening." (朝聞道 夕死可也) And also said, "My Way is threaded through by one principle." (吾道, 一以貫之.)
He said, "A person of purpose does not forget [their potential death] in a ditch; a courageous person does not forget [they might] lose their head." (志士不忘在溝壑, 勇士不忘喪其元.)
He said, "A noble person will sacrifice their life to achieve benevolence, they will not seek life at the expense of benevolence." (君子有殺身而成仁, 無求生而害仁.)
He said, "Rather than die at the hands of retainers, would I not rather die in the hands of you, my disciples?" (予與其死於臣之手也, 無寧死於二三子之手.)
(The above is a passage from Confucius's angry rebuke when, during his illness, his disciple Zilu (子路) improperly had his own followers pretend to be Confucius's retainers (家臣) to attend to his medicinal soup.)
He said, "When the state has the Way, do not change your principles; when the state lacks the Way, do not change until death. How strong and upright!" (國有道不變寨焉, 國無道至死不變, 强哉矯)
The Master was indeed an elder who held a quiet flame within his smiling, gentle countenance, and who possessed the resolve to die forthrightly rather than live compromisingly. His enduring loyalty to his mission—to revere the house of Zhou (周室) and expel the barbarians (夷狄)—even while starving for seven days in Chen and Cai (陳蔡) and facing unreasonable threats from Huan Tui (桓魋), though perhaps small in scale, was it not truly a noble thing? May those in later generations who revere him be fortunate enough not to become his betrayers. Finally, let me write down a few words that can be called his heartfelt confession:
He said, "Do I possess knowledge? I have no knowledge. If a simple man (鄙夫) asks me something, and I am empty (空空如也), I investigate its two extremes and exhaust the matter." (吾有知乎, 無知也, 有鄙夫問於我, 空空如也, 我印其兩端而竭焉.)
He said, "[My wish is] that friends trust me, the old are comforted, and the young are cherished." (朋友信之, 老者安之, 少者懷之.)
(The above is a passage where Confucius, during leisure (燕居), asked his disciples each to state their aspirations, and finally, upon being asked in return by a disciple, stated his own aspiration.)
To those esteemed teachers (先生님들) who, at every turn, say "I am a descendant of Song Uam (宋尤庵)" or "I am a direct descendant of Yi Yulgok (李粟谷)," claiming to be Yangban all by themselves, clicking their long pipes on the porch of the village school (鄕校) and just saying 'it's good,' if such people exist,<86> if you sincerely love Confucius, please read Confucius's inner heart once more. Today, when talk of a Confucian revival (儒敎復興) is prevalent, as we begin to speak of Confucius, the originator (本宗) of this movement, a myriad of emotions converge. However, this column is not intended for writing such things, so I will leave it for another day and stop here.

神者는 吾也 - 崔水雲 先生 (The Divine is I - Master Ch'oe Suun)

In the long history of Korea (朝鮮)—spanning four thousand years—the emergence of sages, philosophers, worthies, geniuses, men of letters, accomplished scholars, heroes, and great figures is truly difficult to count. However, among them, the one who especially possesses a great character transcending past and present, escaping heaven and earth, and who, as the founder of a creative religion, roared the lion's roar (獅子吼) for the construction of a new world culture, can only be said to be the founder (元祖) of Ch'ŏndogyo (天道敎)—Master Ch'oe Suun (崔水雲) (Suun is his style name (號), his given name (名) is Cheu (濟愚)).
The Master was born 98 years ago from now in Kajŏng-ri (柯亭里), Kyŏngju (慶州), Korea. His lineage traces back to the famous Master Ch'oe Ch'iwŏn (崔孤雲先生) of late Silla (新羅), and thus his ancestors were generation after generation from renowned Confucian families of scholar-officials living in retirement (山林公의 儒門名族).
The Master, 61 years ago from now, at the age of 37, on the 5th day of the 4th month of the Kyŏngsin year (庚申), attained great enlightenment (大覺) of the Heavenly Way (天道) and established the religious gate based on the principle of In nae Ch'ŏn (人乃天 - Man is Heaven).
After the Master began propagating his teachings (布敎), in the spring of the Kapcha year (甲子), on the 10th day of the 3rd month—he was executed (慘刑) at the Taegu execution ground (大邱將臺) under the accusation of heresy (異端). Afterward, his mind-dharma (心法) was transmitted to his high disciple, Haewŏltang (海月堂).
Currently, within Korea, the religious factions (敎派) revering the Master's mind-dharma truly reach several dozen types. Furthermore, Ch'ŏndogyo, which inherited his orthodox mind-dharma (正統 心法), progresses day by day, month by month, and now its believers (信徒) number over three million. Is this not truly an unprecedented event since the dawn of Korea (朝鮮 開闢)? Korea's future will forever bear the influence of his mind-dharma, the In nae Ch'ŏn culture, and consequently, those who are Korean should forever commemorate the birth of such a great man from their own land. Confident in this, I now introduce a few words from the Master's teachings. The Master said:
"Listen, you all. The people of this age each act for themselves (各自 爲心), making conflict (干戈) their business. Alas—the fate (運) of this age is sorrowful (慽矣)! Confucianism, Buddhism, Daoism (儒道佛道), after millennia, their fate has also declined. Human hearts are perilous (人心 危), the heart of the Way is faint (道心 微). This age cannot be saved even by the governance (治) of Yao and Shun (堯舜), nor can it be ruled sufficiently by the virtue (德) of Confucius and Mencius (孔孟). Fate must undergo a great revolution (大革); the overturning fate (飜覆 運數) of the whole world—will be opened anew (開闢). Thus, this world has encountered the fate of the Later Heaven's Opening (後天開闢)."
When the Master uttered these words, it was during the reign of King Ch'ŏlchong (哲宗) of the Yi Dynasty (李朝)—an era considered prosperous for the nation's destiny (國運 隆盛). At a time when the whole world—locked the country (鎖國) and sealed the land (封土), and high and low were hazy in a dream <87> of Peach Blossom Spring (桃源), for the Master alone to let out such a lion's roar—what profound insight (達觀) is this? At that time—when scholars aiming to serve the country and save the people (爲國濟民)—all took the governance and virtue of Yao, Shun, Confucius, and Mencius as the ideal for ordering the world and bringing peace to the people (濟世安民), for the Master—alone to declare that this age cannot be addressed by the governance of Yao and Shun, nor mentioned in terms of the virtue of Confucius and Mencius, and to loudly cry out that the overturning fate of the whole world—will be opened anew, vehemently breaking through—what spirit (氣魄) is this? Indeed, after the Master's death—the world's fate greatly changed, presenting the phenomenon of 'four seas, one family' (四海一家), 'all nations, one brotherhood' (萬國同胞). Moreover, especially after the last World War—human hearts changed completely, and the voices of reform (改造) regarding all problems and all doctrines swept the world. Is this truly not the new energy (新氣運) of a new opening of heaven and earth (天地新開闢)? The insight of a divine person (神人)—is generally like this. The Master, at the time of his great enlightenment—on the 5th day of the 4th month, Kyŏngsin year—declared, entrusting it as the words of the Supreme Being (上帝):
"Fifty thousand years after the Opening (開闢)—I (the Supreme Being) also have no merit. Therefore, I caused you (the Master) to be born into the world to teach this law (法). You—do not doubt.
My (Supreme Being's) heart is precisely your (Master's) heart; how could humans know this? Heaven and Earth know, but ghosts and spirits (鬼神) do not know; what are called ghosts and spirits are also I. I bestow upon you the infinite, infinite Way (無窮無窮의 道); if you spread virtue (德) throughout the world with it, you—will live long (長生) and be illustrious (昭然) in the world."
This declaration by the Master—truly erases the manuscripts of the past several thousand years with a single stroke and shows the spirit (氣象) and mettle (氣槪) to personally establish anew the new energy of the Later Heaven's Opening. Saying that even the Supreme Being—had no merit for tens of thousands of years after the Opening—did this not truly spring from the self-awareness (自覺) of intending to save the broad masses (蒼生) through his own convictions? Looking back, it is commonly acknowledged by the knowledgeable (識者) that the world's current phenomenon cannot be completely governed in the realm of thought (思想界) by conventional religion (因襲의 宗敎) and conventional morality (因襲의 道德). In this situation (這間), a greatly revolutionary religion, a revolutionary morality must appear to sweep through the society where everyone acts for themselves (一世 各自 爲心). Even if there are those who argue that the In nae Ch'ŏn doctrine advocated by the Master might not represent it, that belongs to a separate issue. In any case, the world's demand (要求) for a new religion and new morality possessing such revolutionary truth is an unavoidable phenomenon (不可避의 現象). At this juncture, how could the Master's lion's roar not be the dictate of the times (時運) and the divine voice (神의 聲) cried out by all people? The Master also declared his own conviction, saying:
"Listen, you all. My infinite Way is not Confucianism (儒)—nor Buddhism (佛), nor Daoism/Immortality (仙), nor anything else; it is solely the Heavenly Way (天道) itself. All truth (眞理)—is solely encompassed within the Heavenly Way. Therefore, the Heavenly Way is unheard of now, unheard of in antiquity (今不聞古不聞), incomparable to antiquity, incomparable to the present (古不比今不比). However, do not seek the Heavenly Way afar,<88> nor search for it in emptiness (虛), nor seek it elsewhere (他). Only turn back to your own self (汝 自身) and believe (信). The Heavenly Way is not far away; be careful not to abandon the near to grasp the far (捨近取遠).
You always—try to seek the divine (神) in the void (虛空), separate from yourself, but the divine is definitely not something observed apart from oneself; it is only perceived through one's own spirit (心靈). The great consciousness (大靈識) of the great universe (大宇宙)—is equipped within you—yourself. You—realize your infinity through yourself. Thus, you realize that your present activities are still unfinished products (未成品) and advance courageously towards the original substance (本體) of the finished product (旣成品) which is In nae Ch'ŏn. This is the purpose (目的) of human life (人生)."
The In nae Ch'ŏn doctrine declared by the Master emerged from this. The Master spoke of the infinite latent potential (伏能) of human nature (人性) and said that the purpose of human life is for humans to develop this infinite latent potential through their own power. Thus, the Master called present humans still 'unfinished products' and established the In nae Ch'ŏn doctrine as a superhuman faith (超人的 信仰). That is, we today are all unfinished products morally (道德的) and intellectually (思想的). However, humans are inherently endowed (品備) with the superhuman qualities (超現人的 素質) to become finished products. If humans reach these qualities, this world will become an earthly paradise (現世的 天國), he repeatedly declared. The Master also said:
"My beloved Korean people (朝鮮人). I transmit this Way of Infinite Ultimate (無極大道) to you; you transmit it to the myriad billions (天下億兆) of the world. This will be your merit (功德), your eternal glory (榮光), and your pride."
Behold, what an earnest entrustment (付託) this is! If those who are Korean people truly overlook even this simple one-word entrustment lightly, it would truly mean forgetting the affection (愛情) of Koreans for Korea. Thinking about it, amidst the myriad nations of the world today, what does our Korea (吾朝鮮) have to contribute to the world, to bring glory to the world, to be proud of in the world? No matter how we think—of course, this is the reporter's personal view—if we are to build even a little vibrant culture (生氣잇는 文化) from these desolate ruins (荒廢한 故墟), it seems there is nothing else to seek other than abandoning this new morality (新道德) of self-omnipotence (自己萬能主義), In nae Ch'ŏn. <89>

**Summary**

This article contrasts two major figures relevant to Korean thought: Confucius and Ch'oe Suun (Choe Je-u), the founder of Tonghak/Ch'ŏndogyo. The author argues against the common perception of Confucius as effortlessly wise ('born knowing'), instead emphasizing his lifelong dedication to learning and self-cultivation ('strive tirelessly, teach without weariness') and his principled courage against compromise. The second half elevates Ch'oe Suun as a uniquely Korean prophet whose 'In nae Ch'ŏn' (Man is Heaven) doctrine and vision of a 'Later Heaven's Opening' (後天開闢) represent a necessary, revolutionary new path for Korea and the world, surpassing older traditions like Confucianism and Buddhism. The author urges Koreans to embrace Ch'oe Suun's teachings as a source of national pride and cultural regeneration.

From a historical perspective, the article is significant as it reflects early 20th-century Korean nationalist discourse under Japanese colonial rule. It attempts to redefine Korean identity by reinterpreting Confucian heritage (emphasizing effort over innate status, aligning with modern values) and strongly promoting Tonghak/Ch'ŏndogyo, an indigenous religious movement, as the foundation for a unique and revitalized Korean culture capable of contributing to the world. The explicit call to spread Ch'oe Suun's message globally and the framing of his ideas as a 'new morality' for a 'new era' highlight the search for native sources of strength and modernity during a period of national crisis.

爲之不厭, 誨人不倦=孔子

孔子!하면 普通의 우리는 그저 그러케 훌륭히 된 사람으로 생각한다. 卽 生而知之의 聖으로 認한다. 이것이야 말로 큰 탈 날 誤斷이니 孔子미든지 千有餘 年에 우리가 이 貌樣으로 쭈글어지고 만 것은 全혀 이러한 誤斷에 因함이다. 論보다도 証據-이제 先生의 絶叫를 例擧하면
曰, 十有五而志于學, 三十而立, 四十而不惑, 五十而知天命, 六十而耳順, 七十而從心所欲不踰矩.
曰, 十室之邑, 必有忠信如丘者也 未有如丘之好學者也.
曰, 聖與仁吾豈敢乎, 抑爲之不厭, 誨人不倦而己.
曰, 黙而識之, 學而不厭, 誨人不倦何有於我哉.
曰, 德之不修, 學之不講, 聞義不能徒, 不善不能改, 是吾憂也.
曰, 終日不食, 終夜不寐以思, 無益不如學也.
曰, 君子之道三, 我無一能焉, 仁者不憂, 知者不惑, 勇者不懼.
曰, 莫我知也夫, 不怨天不尤人, 下學而上達, 知我者其天乎.
先生은 果然 無雙한 精力家이며 探求者이며 力行者이엇다. 그는 마치 「링컨」이 「와싱톤」을 理想함과 如히 一意周公을 理想하얏다. 그래서 그는 周公의 布施를 體하기에 先하야 周公의 吐哺握髮 達夜待旦-아니 그 熱熱한 精神을 學하얏나니 曰爲之不厭, 曰終日不食, 曰下學而上達, 曰韋編三絶! 果然 어떠한 精力家이엇는가.＜85＞ 曰何有於我哉, 曰是吾憂也, 曰吾無能一焉! 果然 어떠한 探求者이엇는가. 曰三月不知肉味(在齊聞韶) 曰不知老之將至! 果然 어떠한 篤行者이엇는가. 이러한 이를 철업시 誤想하야 그저 生而知之한 兩班이라고. 참 先生이 들으섯스면 긔막힐 일이다. 꾸미는 말로 알지마라. 孔子는 事實 그러케 廉價로 된 孔子가 아니다.

孔子! 하면 어떤 사람들은 그저 점쟌흔 兩班으로서 時代의 形便과 더불어 同流(네-네-)하고 無骨蟲으로 살은 것처럼 생각하는 者도 不無하다. 孔子가 만일 그리하얏스며 그야말로 喪家의 狗는 姑舍하고 偵探집 狗犬만도 못한- 아니 개파리가튼 唯一 卑劣漢일 것이다. 그러길래 孔子는 多幸 그러한 兩班이 아니엇다.
曰, 邦有道, 穀恥也, 邦無道에 穀이 恥也.
曰, 以直報怨, 以德報德.
曰, 朝聞道 夕死可也, 又曰吾道, 一以貫之.
曰, 志士不忘在溝壑, 勇士不忘喪其元.
曰, 君子有殺身而成仁, 無求生而害仁.
曰, 予與其死於臣之手也, 無寧死於二三子之手.
(右는 孔子의 疾이 有할 時, 其 弟子가 되는 子路가 너절하게 自己 門人으로 하야 孔子의 家臣을 假作하야 湯을 侍케 함으로 孔子의 怒叱한 말 中 一節)
曰, 國有道不變寨焉, 國無道至死不變, 强哉矯
先生이 이야말로 웃음의 溫容 中에도 淡淡한 불길을 가진 者이며 苟且히 사는 者가 됨으로 더불어는 시원히 죽을 覺悟를 가진 어룬이엇다. 그가 陳蔡에 7日이나 糧이 絶하고 桓魋에게 無理의 威嚇을 當하며서도 오즉 周室을 尊하고 夷狄을 攘하는 自己의 使命에 終始 忠實함과 如함은-小하다면 小할는지도 모르나-果然 거룩한 일이 아니랴. 後世의 그를 崇信하는 者- 그의 罪人이 되지 아니엇스면 幸甚이다. 終으로 그의 衷情의 告白이라 할 만한 두어마디 말을 적으면
曰, 吾有知乎, 無知也, 有鄙夫問於我, 空空如也, 我印其兩端而竭焉.
曰, 朋友信之, 老者安之, 少者懷之.
(右는 孔子가 燕居에 自己 弟子더러 各各 其志를 言하라 하고 最終 弟子의 反問에 依하야 自己의 志를 言한 一節)
動輒則曰 나는 宋尤庵 子孫이다. 或은 李粟谷의 直派이다 하야 저 혼자 兩班이라 하고 鄕校 마루턱에 긴 담배대 딱딱어리며 그저 조타하는 先生님들이어 만일 잇다＜86＞하면 衷心으로 孔子를 사랑하거던 孔子의 속마음을 다시 한번 읽어 볼지라. 只今 儒敎復興의 말이 盛行하는 今日에 在하야 이 運動의 本宗되는 孔子를 말하기 始作하니 萬感이 交集하는 도다. 그러나 이 欄은 그러한 것을 쓰고저 함이 아닌 故로 他日로 讓하고 이만 그친다.

神者는 吾也 - 崔水雲 先生

朝鮮의 歷史-遼遠한 上下 四千載에 聖哲賢俊, 文人達士, 英雄豪傑의 輩出이 實로 基數를 計키 難하나 然이나 其 中에 特히 橫斷古今 擺脫乾坤의 大人格을 가지고 創造的 宗敎의 建設者로 世界的 新文化 建設의 獅子吼를 부르지즌 者는 오즉 天道敎의 元祖- 崔水雲(水雲은 其號, 名은 濟愚)先生이 有할 뿐이라 하리라.
先生은 距今 98年 前 朝鮮 慶州 柯亭里에서 誕生하니 그 家系는 新羅末-彼有名한 崔孤雲先生의 後裔이며 그리하야 그 先祖는 代代 山林公의 儒門名族이엇다.
先生은 距今 61年 前 그 37歲 時 庚申 4月 5日에 天道를 大覺하고 人乃天 宗旨의 敎門을 立하다.
先生. 布敎 後-午年 甲子 春 3月 10日에 異端의 指目으로 大邱將臺에서 慘刑을 當한 後- 그의 心法은 高弟 海月堂에게 傳하얏더라.
現今 朝鮮 內에 先生의 心法을 崇奉하는 敎派-實로 數十餘 種에 達하엿스며 더욱 그의 正統 心法을 繼承한 天道敎는 日進月新하야 今에 그 信徒-三百萬 以上을 算함에 至하엿나니 이 實로 朝鮮 開闢 以來- 初有의 事-아니냐. 朝鮮의 將來는 少하야도 그의 心法되는 人乃天的 文化의 影響이 永遠히 남겨 잇슬 것이요 딸아서 朝鮮人 된 者- 自家에서 이러한 偉人이 誕生하엿슴을 永遠히 紀念함이 可하리라 自信하는 下에서 이제 先生의 모든 敎訓 中으로부터 두어마디 遺詞를 紹介하건대 先生은 曰
「너이는 들으라. 一世의 人이 各自 爲心하야 干戈를 是事하나니 嗚呼-今世의 運이 慽矣로다. 儒道佛道 累千年에 運이 또한 衰한지라. 人心은 危하고 道心은 微하엿나니 此 世는 堯舜의 治로도 足히 건지지 못할 것이요, 孔孟의 德으로도 足히 다스리지 못할 지라. 반듯이 運命이 大革할 지니 一天下의 飜覆 運數-다시 開闢되리라. 그리하야 이 世上은 後天開闢의 運을 當하엿나니라.」
先生이 此言을 發할 時는 李朝 哲宗時 - 國運 隆盛의 代라. 滿世-國을 鎖하고 土를 封하야 上下 桃源의 夢＜87＞이 朦朧한 時 先生이 홀로 此等의 獅子吼를 부르지즘은 是-何等達觀이냐 當時- 爲國濟民의 士-皆堯舜孔孟의 治德으로써 濟世安民의 理想을 삼는 此際-先生-獨히 此世는 堯舜의 治로도 不足言이요, 孔孟의 德으로도 不可擧라 하고 大聲疾呼로써 一天下의 飜覆運數-다시 開闢되리라 痛破함은 是-何等氣魄이뇨. 果然 先生의 沒後-世運이 大變하야 四海一家 萬國同胞의 現象을 呈하엿스며 더구나 最後 世界大戰 以後- 人心이 一變하야 모든 問題 모든 主義-改造의 聲이 一世를 風靡하게 되엇나니 이 果然- 天地新開闢의 新氣運이 아니냐. 神人의 達觀-대개 如斯하도다. 先生은 庚申 4月 5日-大覺의 際-上帝의 言이라 寓托하고 宣言하야 曰
「開闢 後-五萬年에 余(上帝)-또한 功이 無한지라. 故로 汝(先生)를 世間에 生케 하야 此法을 敎케 하노니 汝-疑치 말라.
吾(上帝)의 心이 곳 汝(先生)의 心이니 人이 어찌 此를 知하리요. 天地는 知하되 鬼神은 不知하나니 鬼神이라 함도 吾니라. 汝에게 無窮無窮의 道를 授하나니 그로써 德을 天下에 布하면 汝-長生하야 天下에 昭然하리라.」
先生의 此一節의 宣言 - 實로 過去 幾千年의 原稿를 一筆로 抹殺하고 後天開闢의 新氣運을 自己 스스로 更定하리라는 氣槪를 나타낸 氣象이 잇다. 開闢後 - 萬萬年에 上帝 - 또한 功이 업섯다 하엿스니 이 實로 自己의 所信으로써 널리 蒼生을 건지리라 하는 自覺의 下에서 湧出한 者-아니리요. 돌아보아 생각컨대 世界 今日의 現象은 因襲의 宗敎, 因襲의 道德으로써 能히 現代의 思想界를 完全히 支配치 못할 것은 識者의 共認하는 바라 這間에 處하야 一大 革新的 宗敎, 革新的 道德이 現出하야 一世 各自 爲心의 社會를 風靡케 할지라. 設使 先生의 主唱한 人乃天主義가 그를 代表치 못하리라 反對하는 者가 有하다 하면 그는 別 問題에 屬한 것이요, 어쨰떤 그러한 革新的 眞理를 가진 新宗敎 新道德을 一世가 要求하는 것은 不可避의 現象이라 할지니 此際에 先生의 此獅子吼-어찌 時運의 所致가 아니며 萬人의 叫號하는 神의 聲이 아니리요. 先生은 또 自己의 所信을 宣言하야 曰
「너이는 들으라. 無窮한 나의 道는 儒 - 아니며 佛이 아니며 仙이 아니며 其他 모든 것이 아니요 오즉 天道 그대로니라. 모든 眞理 - 오로지 天道의 中에 包容되엇는 지라. 그럼으로 天道는 今不聞古不聞이며 古不比今不比니라. 그러나 너이는 天道를 遠에 求치 말며 ＜88＞ 虛에 尋치 말며 他에 求치 말라. 오즉 汝 自身에 反하야 信하라. 天道는 遠에 在치 아니 하나니 너이는 삼가 捨近取遠하지 말라.
너이는 恒常- 自己를 離하야 神을 虛空에 求코저 하나니 神은 決코 自己를 離하야 觀하는 者-아니요. 오즉 自己의 心靈을 通하야 達觀하는 者니다. 大宇宙의 大靈識-汝-自身에 具備하엿는지라. 너이는 너로써 너의 無限함을 覺하라. 그리하야 너이는 現在 너이의 活動이 아즉 未成品임을 깨닷고 人乃天인 旣成品의 本體를 向하야 勇猛잇게 나아가라. 이 곳 人生의 目的이니라.」
先生의 宣言한 바 人乃天主義는 이에서 나타난 말이다. 先生은 人性의 無限의 伏能에 有함을 言하고 人이 自己의 力으로써 人性無限의 伏能을 開拓함이 人生의 目的이라 하엿다. 그리하야 先生은 現人을 가르처 아즉 未成品이라 하고 人乃天主義로써 超人的 信仰을 삼앗다. 即 現今의 吾人은 道德的 又 思想的에서 모두가 未成品이다. 그러나 人은 本來부터 旣成品될 만한 超現人的 素質로 品備하엿나니 人生은 此 素質에 達하고 보면 此世는 現世的 天國이 되리라 함으로써 屢屢 宣言하엿다. 先生은 又曰
「나의 사랑하는 朝鮮人이어. 너에게 이 無極大道로써 傳하야 주나니 너이는 이로써 天下億兆에 傳하야 주라. 이것이 너의 功德이며 너의 永遠한 榮光이며 자랑이 되리라.」
보라 이 얼마나 懇切한 付託이뇨, 朝鮮 사람된 者-이 簡單한 一言의 付託이라도 實로 輕忽히 看過한다 하면 이 實로 朝鮮의 人이 朝鮮을 爲하는 愛情을 忘却한다 하리라. 생각컨대 吾朝鮮이 現在 世界萬國의 間에 介在하야 무엇으로써 世界에 끼처 주고 世界에 榮光되며 世界에 자랑될 만한 것이 무엇일가. 吾人은 아모리 생각하야도 勿論 記者의 私見이지오마는 이 荒廢한 故墟에서 少하야도 生氣잇는 文化를 建設하랴면 이 自己萬能主義인 人乃天의 新道德을 버리고써 他에 求할 者-別無하리라 한다.＜89＞
