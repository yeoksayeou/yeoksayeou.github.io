慶州古詩
						徐四佳
雞林靈異

金雞啁哳樹蒼蒼 九百年來葉盡黃 朴祖開邦傳鵲祖 金王納土似錢王 傷心三姓皆顚蹶 滿目諸陵已廢荒 千古英雄限恨 淡烟衰草更斜陽

Kyerim's Mysterious Wonders

Golden cock crows shrilly, trees are lush and green,
Nine hundred years have passed, the leaves are all yellowed.
Founder Pak established the nation, passing it to Founder Ch'ak,
King Kim surrendered the land, resembling King Ch'iŏn.
Heartbreak that the three clans all stumbled and fell,
Before my eyes, the many tombs are already ruined and desolate.
Eternal heroes' boundless regrets linger,
Faint smoke, withered grass, and again the setting sun.

半月古城

半月城頭日欲西 遠遊情思轉凄凄 靑浮楊簏雲烟老 黃落始林歲月迷 明活村南雲渺渺 興輪寺北草萋萋 百年坎軻知何用 嬴得樽前醉似泥

Ancient Panwŏl Fortress

Atop Panwŏl Fortress, the sun is about to set,
Sentiments of a distant journey turn increasingly desolate.
Green floats at the poplar foot (楊簏), clouds and mist are ancient,
Yellow falls in Shirim (始林) forest, the years and months are lost.
South of Myŏnghwal Village, clouds drift vast and vague,
North of Hŭngnyun Temple, the grass grows thick and dense.
A hundred years of hardship (百年坎軻), what use is knowing it?
All that's gained is getting drunk as mud before the wine cask.

瞻星老臺

古臺牢落號瞻星 遺跡依然近月城 地悴天荒年巳久 風摧雨剝勢會傾 孤山落日金仙影 故纍悲秋玉笛聲 三姓千年會一瞥 不敢登睡更傷情

Old Ch'ŏmsŏng Platform

The ancient platform, desolate, is called Ch'ŏmsŏng (Star-Gazing),
Its remains are still near Wŏlsŏng (Moon Fortress).
The land withered, heaven barren, the years already long,
Wind-torn, rain-stripped, its form seems about to collapse.
Lonely mountain, setting sun, a Golden Immortal's shadow (金仙影),
Old parapets, grieving autumn, the Jade Flute's sound (玉笛聲).
The three clans' thousand years are but a single glance,
Not daring to climb and linger, fearing deeper sorrow.

五陵悲吊

徐伐千年王氣鎖 五陵深處吊前朝 馬嘶龍誕曾荒怪 鵲浦鷄林共寂廖 玉帶寶隨金櫃盡 銅駝影接石羊搖 更無齒餠能傳祚 春樹年年語伯勞＜104＞

Lamenting at the Five Tombs

Sŏbŏl's thousand-year royal aura is locked away,
Deep within the Five Tombs (五陵), I mourn the former dynasty.
Horse neighs, dragon birth (龍誕) – once strange and marvelous tales,
Ch'akp'o (鵲浦) and Kyerim (鷄林) are now equally silent and lonely.
Jade belts (玉帶) and treasures along with the golden chest (金櫃) are exhausted,
Bronze camel (銅駝) shadows touch swaying stone sheep (石羊).
No longer are there rice cakes (齒餠) able to transmit the throne,
Spring trees, year after year, chatter with the shrike (伯勞).<104>

**Summary**

This collection of four poems by Sŏ Sa-ga reflects on the historical sites of Gyeongju (慶州), the ancient capital of the Silla dynasty (referred to by its old names Kyerim 雞林 and Sŏbŏl 徐伐). The poet laments the passage of time, the fall of the Silla kingdom ruled by the three clans (Pak, Sŏk, Kim), and the current desolate state of its once-glorious landmarks like Banwolseong Fortress (半月城), Cheomseongdae Observatory (瞻星臺), and the Royal Tombs (諸陵, 五陵). The poems evoke a sense of *han* (regret, sorrow) over lost history and the ephemeral nature of power and glory, contrasting past legends and splendor with present ruin under the setting sun and amongst overgrown grass.

For historians studying the Korean colonial period, these poems are interesting as they express a deep nostalgia and sorrow for a lost Korean dynasty and its symbols. Published in "Kaebyŏk" magazine, known for its nationalist leanings, this kind of historical reflection, focusing on the decline of a powerful independent Korean past, could be interpreted as a subtle commentary on the contemporary situation under Japanese rule. It highlights the enduring cultural memory and attachment to pre-colonial history among Korean intellectuals of the time.
