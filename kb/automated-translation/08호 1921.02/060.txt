Look at This (Kŏn)

Looking at the notable items among the goods exported from our Chosŏn to foreign countries (based on export amounts for Taishō 7 [1918]):

The export value of rice was 61,541,651 Wŏn

The export value of fish products was over 57,153,000 Wŏn

The export value of gallnuts was 10,603 Wŏn

The amount exported as cattle (combining live cattle, hides, fat, fertilizer) was 4,207,161 Wŏn

The export value of beans was 4,790,904 Wŏn<19>

**Summary**

This short article lists the monetary value of major export goods from Chosŏn (Korea) in the year Taishō 7 (1918). It highlights rice and fish products as the dominant exports by value, followed by beans and cattle products, with gallnuts being a minor export. For historians, this provides specific quantitative data on the colonial Korean economy's export structure early in the Japanese occupation, showing reliance on primary agricultural and marine products directed primarily towards Japan or its empire. The use of the term "우리 朝鮮" (our Chosŏn) is also notable within a colonial context publication.
