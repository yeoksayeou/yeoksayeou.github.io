**Summary**

This "Social Diary" from Kaebyŏk magazine chronicles significant events from mid-May to mid-June 1925, covering domestic Korean affairs and international news impacting East Asia. Key themes include widespread labor strikes and anti-foreign movements in China (especially Shanghai and Beijing, triggered by foreign actions), political maneuvering involving Chinese warlords (Feng Yuxiang, Zhang Zuolin, Duan Qirui) and international powers (Britain, France, US, Japan, Soviet Union), diplomatic negotiations concerning security pacts and disarmament, natural disasters (fires, earthquakes, floods), and social unrest. Within Korea, it reports numerous instances of armed Korean resistance groups clashing with authorities in northern provinces, social disturbances like farmer protests and student violence, economic hardships leading to strikes, cultural events like sports tournaments and art exhibitions, and actions by the Japanese colonial government, including suppressing dissent, controlling land ownership for Koreans in Manchuria, and abolishing the opium monopoly.

For historians, this diary offers a valuable contemporary snapshot of the turbulent atmosphere in East Asia during 1925, particularly the interconnectedness of events in China, Japan, and colonial Korea. It vividly documents the persistent Korean armed struggle against Japanese rule, the growing social and labor unrest within both Korea and China, the brutal realities of colonial policing (e.g., the killing of Kim Ch'il-sŏng), and the complex diplomatic landscape involving major world powers in the region. The mention of the Koryŏ Communist Party's activities and collaborations, alongside the suppression of ideologies ("thought control") by Japan, highlights the burgeoning leftist movements and the colonial response.
