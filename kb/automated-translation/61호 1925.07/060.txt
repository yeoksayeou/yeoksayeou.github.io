Thirteen Great Painters of Chosŏn
						Ko Hŭidong

I have taken up my clumsy brush after a long time under the title "Our Art Pride." However, the scope of art is too broad. I intend only to speak about painting.

But boasting about anything is extremely difficult. Among difficult things, if there is something worth boasting about, one might still manage, but when it's truly difficult to do so, it is indeed the most difficult of difficulties.

However, it is not that art is so completely lacking anything to boast about that it is difficult, but rather because the art that was so great and splendid in ancient times has declined so much in modern times, there is always a feeling of sadness and resentment about the present. To use an analogy, it feels like an ignorant and poor fellow recounting how his ancestors lived well, excelling in literature and enjoying a prosperous life, without considering his own situation, thus unable to escape others' ridicule (嘲笑). Generally, boasting about paintings can be expressed through text or words, but more than that, one must be able to see the works themselves. Through only the sentences written in history or transmitted stories, one cannot grasp the great spirit and marvelous conceptions of the works. In other words, if you face the work before your eyes (眼前), you can understand everything without needing words; it naturally becomes a boast without needing repetition (重言復言). Consequently, it compels people to admire it.

For this reason, there is also deep regret (遺感). That we cannot see the works of high antiquity today might be considered unavoidable, but when it comes to works from eras that could well have been transmitted, yet are also unseen, one truly cannot suppress an indescribable feeling. However, I let go of that regret, realizing that dwelling on it is futile. I will briefly introduce the names and origins of those who created famous works from Silla onwards to recent times.
<22>

The wall painting (壁畵) of Hwangnyongsa Temple in Kwangju – this is said to have been a truly nature-defying work. Birds (鳥鵲), seeing the trees in the painting, reportedly flew towards them intending to perch, only to slip on the wall surface and fall. After some time, when the colors faded and the brushstrokes (필획) blurred, someone else touched it up, and it is said the birds never came again. Even creating a mental image (追想) from this story, how could one not perceive the mysterious, wondrous conception (妙想神) and the vibrant spirit (氣韻) overflowing from the brush tip (筆端) onto the canvas? Besides this, there are the Avalokiteśvara statue at Punhwangsa Temple in Kyŏngju and the Vimalakīrti statue at Tanjutsa Temple in Poju. These were rare treasures (珍品) of the world. The person who produced such works is the one called Solgŏ, a Silla period figure who is the progenitor (元祖) of our art world.

Tamjing – He was a monk from Paekche. In the 11th year of King Mu of Paekche, which was the 27th year of King Chinp'yŏng of Silla (18th year of Empress Suiko of Japan), he crossed over to Japan, manufactured paper, ink, and pigments, and painted (繒字) the wall paintings at Hōryū-ji Temple. Besides this, he surely had many other great works, but today, this Hōryū-ji wall painting is an art piece that Japan truly boasts about globally.

King Kongmin – His given name was Chŏn, and his style names were Ijae or Iktang. He was a king at the end of Koryŏ. His painting style (畵격) was pure and lofty (淸高), and when depicting objects, his subtle brush tip (毫端) was said to be capable of seizing the skill of Heaven (天工). His famous works include the image of Bodhidharma crossing the sea on a reed and the image of Śākyamuni descending from the mountain at Hŭngdŏksa Temple, which were rare masterpieces (稀世의 珍作).

An Kyŏn – His courtesy name was Kado, and his style name was Hyŏndongja. He was a person of King Sejong's time in the Yi Dynasty. He mastered the subtleties of landscape and figure painting, and he is called the founding father (鼻祖) of the art world during the 500 years of the Yi Dynasty. His works include the "Blue Mountains and White Clouds" (靑山白雲圖), "Enjoying the Moon by the River" (臨江玩月圖), and "Ten Thousand Valleys Vie for Flow" (萬壑爭流圖), which were kept in the palace collection at the time. They were rare works.

Ch'oe Kyŏng – His courtesy name was Sadŭk, and his style name was Kŭnjae. His brushwork achieved the true essence in both figure and landscape painting, and his fame rivalled (幷振) that of Hyŏndongja An Kyŏn at the time. His "Cai Ji Returning to the Han" (蔡姬歸漢圖) was a rare masterpiece (稀世의 珍品).

Yi Sang-jwa – His courtesy name was Kongu. He was a person of King Chungjong's time. From childhood, his skill in painting was profound, and his genius astonished people. In the 38th year of King Chungjong, he painted the "Biographies of Exemplary Women" (烈女傳).

Kim Che – His courtesy name was Kyesu, and his style name was Yangsongdang. His brushwork was exquisite in figures, landscapes, birds and animals (翎毛), and plants and insects (草虫). At the time, he was praised as one of the "Three Excellences" (三絶) along with the prose of Kanŭi Ch'oe Rip and the calligraphy of Sŏkpong Han Ho.

Lady Sin – Her style name was Saimdang. She was the mother of Yi Yulgok and lived during King Chungjong's time. She displayed exquisite brushwork in landscapes, flowering plants (花奔), and plants and insects (草虫). Even today, one can occasionally see fragments of her ink works (殘墨短楮).

Yi Kyŏng-yun – His courtesy name was Kyegil, and his style name was Nakp'a. He lived during King Injong's time. His painting quality <23> was lofty (孤高), and he excelled deeply in figures, landscapes, and birds and animals (翎毛). He created sketches of Kŭmgangsan (Diamond Mountains).

Yi Chŏng – His courtesy name was Konggan, and his style name was Naong. He lived during King Sŏnjo's time. He showed talent in painting from the age of 5 and achieved mastery by the age of 10. He traveled to Kŭmgangsan 11 times. When Changan Temple was reconstructed, he painted many landscapes and Buddhist images on the temple walls. He died at the young age of 30.

Kim Myŏng-guk – His courtesy name was Ch'ŏnyŏ, and his style name was Yŏndam. He was proficient in landscapes and figures. He did not flatteringly imitate (諂襲) the methods of the ancients but instead opened up his own heart/mind (胸襟). When he went to Japan as part of an envoy mission (通信使), people of that time treasured even a small piece of paper or ink (片紙寸墨) from him like jewels. His "Old Immortals Playing Go" (老仙圍棋圖) and "Misty River at Dawn Sky" (烟江曉天圖) are both masterpieces passed down through generations.

Chŏng Sŏn – His courtesy name was Wŏnbaek, and his style name was Kyŏmjae. He lived during King Sukchong's time. He excelled in landscapes. His brushwork was vigorous and fluid (壯健淋漓), and he established his own school by sketching real scenery (眞景). He sketched many famous sights throughout Chosŏn. Therefore, Kyŏmjae was the first painter to sketch landscapes from life.

Kim Hong-do – His courtesy name was Sanŭng, and his style name was Tanwŏn. He lived during King Chŏngjo's time. His brushwork reached a divine level in figures, landscapes, and folding screens/branches (折技). He depicted the customs of Chosŏn, that is, the social phenomena of the time. Thus, Tanwŏn was the first artist to sketch contemporary reality from life. He also illustrated the "Five Cardinal Virtues in Practice" (五倫行實), but the currently circulating version has many inaccuracies (失眞한 点이 多하니라) because the original woodblocks were lost in a fire, and it is a reprint (翻刊한 者).

Besides these, there must certainly be others who left masterpieces, but merely introducing names and dates without transmitted works is too regrettable to elaborate further. I will end here for now and await the next opportunity. <24>
<22-24>

**Summary**

Writing in 1925, the painter Ko Hŭidong laments the decline of Korean painting from its glorious past, comparing boasting about it now to a poor man bragging about rich ancestors. He argues that true appreciation requires seeing the actual artworks, many of which are unfortunately lost. Ko then introduces thirteen great painters from Silla (Solgŏ, Tamjing) through Koryŏ (King Kongmin) and the Chosŏn Dynasty (An Kyŏn, Ch'oe Kyŏng, Yi Sang-jwa, Kim Che, Sin Saimdang, Yi Kyŏng-yun, Yi Chŏng, Kim Myŏng-guk, Chŏng Sŏn, Kim Hong-do), briefly describing their styles, famous works (some legendary like Solgŏ's), and significance, highlighting pioneers like Chŏng Sŏn (real scenery) and Kim Hong-do (genre scenes). He concludes with regret that many works are lost and promises more later. From a colonial history perspective, the article reflects a strong sense of Korean cultural nationalism and pride in native artistic heritage during a period of Japanese rule. Ko's lament about the "decline" implicitly contrasts with the perceived current state under colonial influence, while highlighting figures like Tamjing, whose work became a treasure *in Japan*, subtly underscores Korea's historical cultural influence.

朝鮮의 十三大畵家
						高羲東
우리의 미술 자랑이라는 제목으로 오래간만에 서투른 붓을 잡게 되엿다. 그러나 미술이라면 범위가 너무 광범하다. 다만 그림에 대한 말만 허고자 헌다.
그런데 무엇이고 자랑이라는 것이 대단히 어렵다. 어려운 중에도 자랑헐만헌 것이 잇스면 오히려 헐 수가 잇지마는 허기 어려운 경우에 잇서서는 참으로 곤란헌 중에도 곤란하다.
그러나 미술이라는 것이 참으로 자랑할 것이 아주 업서서 곤란하다는 것이 아니라 고대에 잇서서는 그 위대하고도 또 찬란허든 그 미술이 근대에 이르러서 너무도 沈衰하여저서 항상 현재의 섭섭허고도 또 원통헌 늣김이 잇는 까닭이다. 맛치 비유하야 말허면 무식허고 빈궁헌 놈이 자기의 옛날 선조가 문장에다 풍요한 생활을 겸하야 잘 지내엿섯다는 말을 옴기여 자기의 견지를 생각지 아니하고 남의 嘲笑를 免치 못하는 것 갓다는 늣김이 잇다는 말이다. 大抵 그림이라는 것을 자랑헌다는 것은 문자나 혹은 언어로도 표시헐 수가 잇겟지만 그것보다도 그 작품을 보게 되여야 허는 것이다. 역사상에 씨여잇는 文句이나 전래하는 이야기로만은 그 작품의 위대한 정신과 신묘한 착상을 아라내일 수 업다. 다시 말허면 작품을 眼前에 대허면 모든 것을 말하지 아니허여도 알 수 잇게 된다는 말이니 重言復言헐 것 업시 제절노 자랑이 되는 것이요. 따라서 사람으로 하야금 찬미하지 아니치 못허게 되는 것이다.
이럼으로 또한 深切한 遺感이 잇다. 上古의 작품을 이제 잇서서 대하야 볼 수 업는 것은 오히려 웃지혈 수 업는 일이라 허겟지마는 가히 전래할 수 잇슬만한 연대에 잇는 것도 또한 볼 수 업다는 일에 이르러서는 참으로 넘으도 말할 수 업는 늣김을 억제헐 수 업다. 그러나 그 遺感은 작구 말을 하야도 별 소용업다는 데로 돌녀보내고 만다. 新羅이후로 近世에 이르기 까지에 유명한 작품이 잇섯다는 것과 그 작품을＜22＞ 創자한다 介허고 略干紹名이나 이의 氏出한
廣州 黃龍寺의 壁畵 이것은 참으로 奪造化한 작품이엿섯다 한다. 그 그림에 잇는 나무를 鳥鵲이 바라보고 깃드리고자 하야 나라왓다가 다만 壁上에 밋그러지고 마랏다. 을마후에 채색이 버서지고 필획이 흐미하여진 것을 타인이 補添하엿더니 鳥鵲이 다시 오지아니하드라 한다하니 이 말노 만들어 追想을 헌들 읏지 그 祕한 妙想神이 筆端을 따라 화면에 넘치는 氣韻을 알 수 잇지 아니허랴. 이 외에도 慶州 芬黃寺의 觀音像과 普州 斷住寺의 維摩居士像 등이다. 絶世에 珍品이엿섯다. 이러헌 등 작품을 지어내인 이는 즉 우리 미술계에 잇서서 元祖되는 新羅時人에 率居라 명칭하는 이이다.
曇徵 이는 百濟때의 僧이니 百濟 武王 11년 즉 新羅 眞平王 27년(日本 推古天皇 18년)에 日本에 渡去하야 紙墨과 채색을 제조하고 法隆寺 벽화를 繒字한 이니 이외에 다른 작품도 응당 위대헌 것이 만앗지마는 이제 이 法隆寺의 벽화는 現今 日本에서 세계적으로 참 자랑하는 미술이다.
恭愍王 諱는 顓이요. 號는 怡齋 또는 益堂이라 허엿고 高麗말의 임군으로 畵격이 凊高하야 物像을 묘사할 제 微妙한 毫端은 능히 天工을 奪하엿다 한다. 그의 高名헌 작품은 折葦渡海하는 達摩像과 興德寺의 釋迦出山像 등이 稀世의 珍作이엿섯다.
安堅 字는 可度요 號는 玄洞子요 李朝 世宗時 人이니 산수와 인물에 其妙를 각각 다 하얏고 이조 500년간 美術界의 鼻祖라 한다. 그의 작품으로는 당시에 궁내에 소장되엿든 靑山白雲圖와 臨江玩月圖와 萬壑爭流圖 등이다. 희귀한 작품이엿섯다.
崔涇 字는 思得이요 號는 謹齋니 그의 筆韻이 人物山水에 各各 다 그 眞妙를 得하야 당시의 玄洞子 安堅과 명성이 幷振하엿섯스 蔡姬歸漢圖는 稀世의 珍品이엿섯다.
李上佐 字는 公祐요 中宗時 人이니 幼時로부터 繪畵에 工이 深大하야 그의 천재는 사람으로 하여금 놈나게 하엿스며 中宗 38년에 烈女傳을 畵하니라.
金禔 字는 季綏요. 號는 養松堂이요 그의 필치는 인물, 산수, 翎毛, 草虫에 精妙치 아니함이 업섯고 당시에 簡易 崔岦의 문장과 石峰 韓濩의 명필과 더부러 三絶이라 칭하니라.
申氏 號는 思妊堂이요 李栗谷의 母堂이니 中宗時 人이라 산수와 花奔와 草虫에 精妙한 筆端을 발휘허엿섯스며 지금에도 혹 殘墨短楮를 得見헐 수 잇다.
李慶胤 字는 季吉이요 號는 駱坡니 仁宗時 人으로 畵品이＜23＞ 孤高하야 인물 산수 翎毛에 다 工이 深切하얏고 金剛山을 寫生헌 것이 잇섯다.
李楨 字는 公幹이요 號는 懶翁이요 宣祖時 人이니 5歲時로부터 畵에 능하야 10歲時에 大成하니라. 11차를 金剛山에 유람하야 長安寺를 改搆할 때에 寺壁에 山水와 佛影을 多畵하얏고 年이 겨우 30에 卒하니라.
金明國 字는 天汝요 號는 蓮潭이니 산수와 인물에 정통하며 古人의 法을 諂襲하지 아니하고 자기의 胸襟을 創開하엿스며 通信使를 따라 日本에 渡去하엿슬 때에 時人이 片紙寸墨이라도 得키만 하면 寶玉갓치 역이셧고 老仙圍棋圖와 烟江曉天圖 등은 다 傳世의 絶品이 되엿섯다.
鄭歚 字는 元伯이요 號는 謙齋니 肅宗時 人이라 산수에 精能하니 그 필법이 壯健淋漓하야 眞景을 寫生하기에 一家를 自成하얏스니 朝鮮 各處各勝을 만히 寫生하니라. 그럼으로 풍경을 사생한 화가로는 謙齋가 비롯이니라.
金弘道 字는 士能이요 號는 檀園이니 正宗時 人이요 그의 필법은 인물, 산수, 折技 등에 入神치 아님이 업스며 朝鮮의 풍속 즉 당시 사회의 현상을 묘사하엿스니 현대의 실제를 사생한 家로는 檀園이 비롯이니라. 또 五倫行實을 繪字하얏섯는데 現今 유행하는 本은 原板이 화재에 소실되엿슴으로 翻刊한 者이라 失眞한 点이 多하니라.
이외에도 傑作을 끼친 이기 물론 잇슬 터이나 한갓 성명이나 연대를 소개함에 지나지 아니허고 또한 작품을 전허는 것이 업는데 너무도 유감들이기 어려워 다만 이에 끗치며 이 다음 기회를 기다리고자 한다. ＜24＞
