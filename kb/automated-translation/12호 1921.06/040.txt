The Hearts/Character of the Eight Provinces as Seen by the Ancients

Kyŏnggi-do: Beauty in a Mirror (鏡中美人)

Ch'ungch'ŏng-do: Clear Wind, Bright Moon (淸風明月)

Chŏlla-do: Thin Willow in the Wind (風前細柳)

Kyŏngsang-do: Great Mountain, Tall Timber (泰山喬嶽)

Hwanghae-do: Stone Thrown into Clear Waves (淸波投石)

P'yŏngan-do: Fierce Tiger on a Green Mountain (靑山猛虎)

Kangwŏn-do: Old Buddha Under a Precipice (嚴下老佛)

Hamgyŏng-do: Fighting Dog in a Mud Field (泥田鬪狗) <22>

**Summary**

This short piece lists traditional metaphorical descriptions for the character or "heart" (人心) of the people from each of Korea's Eight Provinces (八道), as attributed to "ancients" (古人). Each province is associated with a evocative phrase, such as "Beauty in a Mirror" for Kyŏnggi-do or "Fighting Dog in a Mud Field" for Hamgyŏng-do, reflecting regional stereotypes. From a historical perspective, the article is interesting as it records these long-standing regional characterizations within the context of early colonial Korea, published in a notable intellectual magazine. Historians might find it useful for studying the persistence and nature of regional identities and stereotypes during a period of significant social and political change.
