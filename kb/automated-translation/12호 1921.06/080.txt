What is the System of Eastern Learning of the Way?
						Recorded by Kang Ch'unsan
The Learning of the Cheng Brothers (程朱) - Elder Cheng (大程子)
Introduction (Biography and Writings)
Cheng Hao's (程顥) courtesy name was Paeksun (伯淳), and he was a native of Honam (河南). His father, Cheng Hsiang (程珦), reached the official rank of Grand Master for Closing Court (太中太夫). Paeksun was born in the first year of the Mingdao era (明道元年, 1032 CE). As a child, he was not yet able to speak well. His paternal aunt was carrying him while walking and unknowingly dropped her hairpin (釵). Several days later, when she searched for it, the Master pointed with his hand, and following where he indicated, the hairpin was indeed found there. At the age of 15, along with his younger brother Ich'ŏn (伊川), he went to study under Chou Musuk (周茂叔, Zhou Dunyi). From this time, he resolutely grew weary of studies for the civil service examinations (科學) and harbored the will to seek the Way (道), it is said. He passed away on the 15th day of the 6th month of the 8th year of Yuanfeng (元豊8年, 1085 CE) at the age of 54. Wen Yen-po (文彦博) inscribed "Mingdao" (明道) on his tombstone. Apart from several dozen poems and prose pieces he authored, he left no other distinct works; the only source to see his sayings is the *Recorded Conversations* (語錄).

His Scholarly Lineage
The thought of Confucius (孔子) is found in the *Analects* (論語), and the central point of his thought lies in completing one's own personality (人格). That is, it lies in cultivating the kind of personality capable of implementing the way of the ancient kings' governance. After Confucius's death, Mencius (孟子) alone inherited and elaborated upon this learning. Along with the flourishing of scholarship in the Song Dynasty, there were Shao Tzu (邵子, Shao Yong) and Chou Tzu (周子, Zhou Dunyi), both famous as philosophers. However, amidst uncertainty about whether they truly grasped Confucius's intent, the one who was able truly to grasp Confucius's intent must be said to be Cheng Mingdao (程明道) himself. Ich'ŏn, writing Mingdao's biographical sketch, said, "The Master, born fourteen hundred years later, obtained the untransmitted learning from the remaining classics (遺經)," which seems fitting. Mingdao's philosophy is not pure philosophy; it lies in the study of self-cultivation (修身學). This is because he was detached from ethics (倫理) and emphasized practice (實踐).

Ethical Theory (倫理論)
(1) Benevolence (仁) is Primal Qi (元氣). Mingdao agonized greatly to reconcile the concept of the goodness of nature (性善) with Confucius. He inquired of various schools, seeking to explain this. <32> Although his thought was not yet settled at the time, he claimed, "I sought it back in the Six Classics (六經) and found it." The Six Classics refer to the *Rites* (禮), *Music* (樂), *Odes* (詩), *Documents* (書), *Changes* (易), and *Spring and Autumn Annals* (春秋). Confucius advocated for a single Benevolence (仁). The virtue of Benevolence is indescribable (名狀키 不可); its greatness has no outside, and its smallness has no inside. The *Changes* states, "The great virtue of Heaven and Earth is called giving life (生)." Therefore, Benevolence is Life itself. This Life comes into being through the Primal Qi (一元之氣). The *Changes* says, "The Qian principle (乾元), originating, provides the beginning." The Primal Qi cannot but be Benevolence; if it is Benevolence, it cannot but be good. Therefore, the *Changes* says, "The Primal (元) is the chief of goodness (善之長). Humans and things all receive this Primal Qi to be born and grow; therefore, there is no reason why their nature (性) should not be good." Mingdao considered Benevolence to be good because it is the Primal Qi. This is how he found the basis of goodness, surpassing Hsun Tzu (荀子) and reconciling Confucius and Mencius. All his lifelong discourses ultimately return to this point.
(2) Nature (性) is Primal Qi. This is greatly different compared to previous thinkers. What is most worthy of attention in Mingdao's theory of Nature is this. He said, "Life is called Nature (生之謂性), Nature is Qi (性卽氣), Qi is Nature (氣卽性), it is called life (生之謂也)." The phrase "Nature is Qi" refers to the Primal Qi discussed in the previous section. Therefore, Nature is said to be good. He also said, "Once humans are born with an endowment of Qi (氣稟), it is impossible for there not to be good and evil in principle (理). However, it is not that two things, originally good and evil, are opposed within Nature from the start. That there is goodness and evil from infancy is simply the spontaneity of the Qi endowment. Just as goodness is originally Nature, evil too must be called Nature." If so, then Mingdao's theory of Nature is incomplete.
(3) Nature is Absolute. Since Nature is already Primal Qi, and Primal Qi fills the cosmos, its absoluteness requires no argument. Based on this concept, he drafted the piece known as the *Essay on Stabilizing Nature* (定性書). Discussing the absoluteness of Nature, he said, "What is called 'stabilizing' (定) means that activity (動) is also stable, and stillness (靜) is also stable. There is no anticipating or receiving (將迎), no inside or outside (內外). If one treats external things as external and generates the self to follow them, this means the self considers Nature to have an inside and outside."
(4) Benevolence is Absolute. Since Benevolence is Primal Qi, which is Nature, its absoluteness needs no restatement. However, Nature observes Primal Qi statically, while Benevolence observes Primal Qi dynamically; it is nothing more than this. His *Essay on Recognizing Benevolence* (識仁篇) discusses based on this concept. Discussing the absoluteness of Benevolence, he said, "Benevolence is undifferentiated (渾然), encompassing things and the self (物與軆) together; Righteousness (義), Propriety (禮), Wisdom (智), and Trustworthiness (信) are all Benevolence." He also explained using an analogy from medicine, saying, "Numbness and paralysis (痿痺) of the hands and feet in medical texts is precisely 'non-benevolence' (不仁)." This statement must be called most excellently named. The benevolent person forms one body (一軆) with Heaven, Earth, and all things; there is nothing that is not the self. When the hands and feet are 'non-benevolent,' the Qi of the entire body also fails to penetrate freely (貰通치 못하야) and does not belong to the self. Therefore, it is said, "Broadly benefiting and aiding the masses (博施濟衆) is the function of the sage." Thus, the meaning of Benevolence being the consistent absolute of the universe can be seen here. Among the dozens of passages where the two Cheng brothers discuss Benevolence, none deviates from this meaning. <33>
(5) Mind (心). The Primal Qi (乾元之氣) of the universe is Nature (性), which is Benevolence (仁). Therefore, form (形) cannot but be the Way (道). He said, "The Way is Nature (道 即 性). Seeking Nature outside the Way, or seeking the Way outside Nature, is not how the sages discussed the virtue of Heaven (天德)." Then, what is his view regarding the Mind (心)? If asked, it would be said that there is a distinction between the human mind (人心) and the Mind of the Way (道心). The Mind of the Way, speaking of its original nature, is Heavenly Principle (天理). Heavenly Principle is the Way. Only when obscured (蔽) by human desires (人欲) does one reach the point of forgetting Heavenly virtue. Therefore, when human desires are removed, the Mind becomes Heavenly Principle. All Mind is an active entity. In its existence, it cannot but be dynamic (力學的). Now, what Mingdao calls the Great Principle (大理) is Nature, which is Primal Qi. The Mind, also being Primal Qi, is said to be a dynamic reality.
Conclusion of Ethical Theory. The arising of Heaven and Earth is called Benevolence. In humans, this is called Nature, the Way, or the Mind of the Way. Therefore, the Mind of the Way is the same for all humans, and what the sages transmitted cannot but emerge from this Mind. This is the absolute, and the method by which its heavenly genuineness is manifested is as follows.

His Theory of Effort/Practice (工夫論)
The effort (工夫) of cultivation lies in Focusing on One without Deviation (主一無適). Each person's Nature is originally complete and sufficient. Mencius's statement, "All things are complete within me (萬物皆備於我)," is indeed true. Only because human desires obstruct it, the original good nature cannot manifest its own brilliance. Therefore, the effort of cultivation lies solely in removing human desires and preserving only the public Mind of the Way. Thus, the method lies solely in governing the mind through reverence (敬). When one is reverent, the natural, wondrous quality manifests itself as it is. He said, "Focus on one without deviation, straighten the inner with reverence (敬以直內), then there will be the flood-like Qi (浩然之氣). For the flood-like [Qi], one must truly recognize its firmness, greatness, and straightforwardness; without practice, there is nothing it cannot achieve (無不利)."
(1) The Way of Cultivation lies in Learning (爲學). Those who know through birth are few in the world. Generally, to prevent the harm of human desires that obscure one's Nature, learning is essential. Learning means studying human affairs below and reaching Heavenly Principle above; it is not merely playing with empty words and floating phrases. Therefore, he said, "The learner must learn it. One who knows the Way simply advances in virtue. If one has virtue, then without practice, there is nothing unachieved. There has never been someone who learned to raise a child before getting married; it means they first attained this Way. The effort of studying texts: learning one matter is one matter, two matters are two matters. Extending by analogy, reaching hundreds and thousands, even to the utmost exhaustion, is still just learning." From this, one can see what he meant by learning.
(2) The Effort of Cultivation lies in Forgetting Inside and Outside. The greatness of Nature transcends inside and outside. Therefore, we should not move our minds but statically perceive right and wrong clearly. We should not be joyful or angry due to ourselves, but be joyful or angry according to the things themselves. This idea is in the latter half of the *Essay on Stabilizing Nature*. He said, "The constancy of Heaven and Earth lies in their mind extending universally to all things without having a [private] mind. The constancy of the sage lies in his emotions according with all affairs without having [private] emotions. Therefore, for the learning of the noble person, there is nothing better than being vastly open and greatly impartial (廓然而大公), responding appropriately as things come." And the *Changes* says, "Restraining his back, he does not get hold of his body. Walking in his courtyard, he does not see his person." Mencius said, "What is disliked in the wise is their forcing things (鑿也). Rather than rejecting the external and affirming the internal, it is better to forget both internal and external. <34> Forgetting both, one becomes clear and tranquil, without affairs (澄然無事). Without affairs, one becomes stable (定). Stable, one becomes clear (明). Clear, how then can responding to things be a burden? The sage's joy is due to things being worthy of joy; the sage's anger is due to things being worthy of anger. Thus, the sage's joy and anger are not tied to the mind but tied to things." Therefore, the effort of cultivation is all about controlling one's subjective emotions and following the objective Principle.
(3) The Effort of Cultivation lies in Recognizing Benevolence (識仁). This refers to knowing the absoluteness of Benevolence and then embodying this recognition (體認). Therefore, he said, "The learner must first recognize Benevolence. The benevolent person is undifferentiatedly one body with things. Righteousness, Propriety, Wisdom are all governed by Benevolence. Recognize this principle, and preserve it with reverence. There is no need for prevention and checking (防檢), no need for exhaustive seeking (窮索). If the mind becomes lax, then there is need for prevention. If it is not lax, what prevention is there? If the principle is not yet obtained, one needs to seek exhaustively. If preserved long enough, it naturally becomes clear; why wait for exhaustive seeking? This Way has no opposite among things; its greatness cannot be named."
(4) Final Word on the Theory of Effort. The above four points are merely the main outlines of the effort. The former two are based on removing evil, the latter two on embodying recognition. Although he learned the method of cultivation from Buddhism (佛家), he differed from Buddhism in that, in cultivation, he necessarily unified lower-level learning (下學) and higher attainment (上達). Buddhism, however, abolished the element of lower-level learning and merely advocated seeing one's nature to become a Buddha (見性成佛). At this point, Buddhist cultivation is useless to society, while Confucian (儒家) cultivation is beneficial to society.

Conclusion
Mingdao's philosophy, in terms of effort/practice, shows no flaws, but in terms of theory, it definitely cannot be called successful. This is because his explanation of good and evil in Nature did not achieve clarity, correctness, and precision. Next, the main points of Mingdao's philosophy are as follows: (1) Primal Qi is Nature. (2) The Mind of the Way is Nature, which is Heavenly Principle. However, the one who compensated for its weaknesses is said to be Mingdao's younger brother, Ich'ŏn. The first main point was inherited through Yang Kuei-shan (楊龜山, Yang Shi) down to Hu Wu-feng (胡五峰, Hu Hong), and the second main point was transmitted to Hsieh Shang-ts'ai (謝上蔡, Xie Liangzuo) and reached Lu Hsiang-shan (陸象山, Lu Jiuyuan).

Younger Cheng (小程子) (Biography and Writings)
Cheng Ich'ŏn's (程伊川) given name was I (頤), and his courtesy name was Chŏngsuk (正叔). He was a native of Honam (河南). Because he resided by the I River (伊水), he was called Ich'ŏn. He was Mingdao's younger brother. He possessed high understanding and did not act contrary to propriety (禮). At the age of 18, he submitted a memorial at the palace gate, urging Emperor Renzong (仁宗) to value the kingly way. He passed away in the 9th month of the first year of Daguan (大觀元年, 1107 CE) at the age of 75. In the 13th year of Jiading (嘉定, 1220 CE), he was given the posthumous name Duke Cheng (正公). His extant works include the 4-volume *Commentary on the Changes* (易傳), the 9-volume *History of the Song* (宋志, likely refers to his contributions or related historical works, not a standalone title), and several dozen contemporary essays. However, the source from which his philosophical thought can be seen is only the *Recorded Conversations* (語錄). That the learning of the two Cheng brothers is similar is attributed to their shared experiences, but it must be assumed that Ich'ŏn's scholarly origins are undeniably rooted in Mingdao. Therefore, amidst the vast *Complete Works of the Two Chengs* (二程全書), we intend to discuss only the points where he differs from Mingdao.

Nature and Qi (性與氣) <35>

Mingdao, while explaining the goodness of Nature, attempted to explain the origin of evil but failed, saying, "In human life's Qi endowment (氣禀), principle (理) has good and evil." On this, Ich'ŏn clearly stated, "Human nature (人性) is entirely good, but Qi has clarity (淸) and turbidity (濁). Those endowed with clear Qi become good people upon birth, while those endowed with turbid Qi become evil people. Nature is good principle, while having good and evil is talent (才)." He also said, "Nature comes from Heaven (天), talent comes from Qi (氣). If Qi is clear, talent is clear; if Qi is turbid, talent is turbid. Talent thus has good and not-good; Nature has nothing that is not good." Furthermore, explaining the universality of Nature's goodness as being equal in each person, he said, "Nature is without non-goodness, but that there are those who are not good is due to talent. Nature is Principle (理). Principle is one and the same from Yao and Shun down to the man on the street. Talent is endowed by Qi. Qi has clarity and turbidity. Those endowed with its clarity become worthy; those endowed with its turbidity become foolish." At this point, Nature and Qi became distinct, and the theory of the goodness of Nature can be said to have been definitively established.
(1) The Activity of Nature. Nature is Principle (理); it is not abstract or formal, but dynamic (力學的). Therefore, Nature is capable of activation; when activated, it is called emotion (情). Nature is absolutely good, but emotion cannot attain its appropriateness (宜). However, based on this, one cannot say emotion is not good. In response to a question about Nature being good and emotion not good, he replied, "Emotion is the activity of Nature. It just needs to return to correctness (正). How can it be named as not good?" If emotion is the activity of Nature, its lack of non-goodness is clear. Thus, emotion must be innately (先天的 腦膸的) good.
(2) Nature is Mind (性卽心). Ich'ŏn, reaching this point, revealed that Nature is Mind, saying, "Mencius said, 'He who exhausts his mind knows his nature.' Mind is Nature (心卽性也)." Then, the question arises: in what sense do Nature and Mind differ? In response to this, he said, "In Heaven, it is mandate (命); in righteousness, it is principle (理); in humans, it is nature (性); presiding over the body, it is mind (心). They are all one." Thus, mandate, principle, nature, and mind are nothing but different aspects of the Way (道). The Way is active. Since it is the substance (本體) that generates all things, the Mind cannot but be the substance.
(3) Mind is the Substance (本體). Mind is the substance that generates. Therefore, he said, "The mind generates the Way (心生道也). Having this mind, one possesses this form to live. The feeling of commiseration (惻隱之心) is the way of human life (人之生道也)." Mind is absolute. Therefore, he also said, "The mind of one person is the mind of Heaven and Earth (天地之心)." At this point, Mingdao and Ich'ŏn can be said to be in agreement. Mind, as the substance, is equipped with the myriad principles (萬理). On this point, there is also the famous theory of "Vastly Tranquil Without Sign" (沖漠無朕). He said, "Vastly tranquil without sign, the myriad forms are densely present already complete (萬象森然已具). Before response, it is not earlier; after response, it is not later. Like a hundred-foot tree, from root to leaves and branches, it is all a single coherence (一貫). It is not that the formless, traceless part above waits for people to arrange and introduce it, teaching it to enter the path." That is, Principle is complete in the Mind, but it is not internal. It can be tread upon and followed, yet it is not external either. It is vastly tranquil, offering no trace to be seen. It is the Way of daily constant ethical principles (日常彝倫), from sprinkling and sweeping, responding to anxieties, up to loyalty, filial piety, and all aspects of the Way.
(4) Knowledge. Mind is Principle (理); Qi is the realm below form (形而下), inevitably having limits of size. <36> The generation of things is the coagulation of Qi; the extinction of things is the dispersion of Qi. Therefore, the principle of individuality ultimately resides in Qi. He said, "The names and meanings of things, along with Qi and Principle, penetrate all. Why is Heaven Heaven? What is its basis? Is it just the azure expanse? The reason it is named Heaven is likely the principle of spontaneity (自然之理). Names emerge from Principle; sounds emerge from Qi. The universe, due to this, is inexhaustibly vast." Also, his view that the differentiation of various things is due to the clarity and turbidity of Qi, not Principle, is a most noteworthy point – this is the origin (濫觴) of Chu Hsi's (朱子) learning.
Distinguishing between Principle and Qi, he also posited that in knowledge, there is knowledge from hearing and seeing (聞見之知, learning and knowing) and knowledge from virtuous nature (德性之知, knowing through silent contemplation and penetration). The so-called knowledge from hearing and seeing belongs to Qi and is inevitably limited, while the knowledge from virtuous nature belongs to Principle and has no distinctions of size or scope. He said, "Knowledge from hearing and seeing is not knowledge from virtuous nature. When things interact with things, one knows them; it is not internal. Those called broadly learned and multi-talented today are of this type. Knowledge from virtuous nature does not rely on hearing and seeing." The one who hits the mark without effort and attains without thinking does so because of possessing this knowledge from virtuous nature.
(5) Conclusion on Nature and Qi. Ich'ŏn asserted that Nature is Principle, stipulated that Qi has clarity and turbidity, made the distinction between Nature and Qi distinct (截然케), designated Qi as below form, and Nature as above form (形而上). However, by stating it becomes a dynamic reality and identifying it with Mind, while simultaneously forming the "Vastly Tranquil Without Sign" theory, and also stating Nature is Mind and the Substance, its manifestation occurs through the pre-existing Qi. Therefore, his philosophical standpoint is dualism (二元論); it is definitely not that a single Mind manifests to generate the universe and all things. This is where he differs from Mingdao – Mingdao's philosophy was a monism (一元論) where Nature is Primal Qi.

Theory of Effort/Practice (工夫論)
(1) Cultivation lies in Nurturing Qi. Since Ich'ŏn stated that Qi has clarity and turbidity, the purpose of cultivation lies in rectifying the turbid aspect. He said, "Qi has clarity and turbidity, while Nature has no non-goodness. Mencius's nurturing the flood-like Qi (浩然之氣) is nurturing this. When reaching the ultimate point, one becomes clear, bright, pure, and complete, removing the evil of dim obstruction." Then, where does the method for nurturing this lie? He said, "In having few desires (寡欲)."
(2) The Effort of Cultivation lies in the Investigation of Principle (窮理). Ich'ŏn believed, "Only after accumulating the investigation of principle can one then attain sudden enlightenment (脫然). It is not permissible to focus on just one matter and claim the effect of investigating principle is complete." That Ich'ŏn explained this idea numerous times shows it was his fundamental thought. He divided the method of investigating principle into three: "First, reading books to clarify the meaning and principle. Second, discussing figures of past and present to distinguish their right and wrong. Third, handling affairs and responding to interactions appropriately." This differs from Mingdao's approach, and because it belongs to knowledge from hearing and seeing, Lu Hsiang-shan (象山) extremely opposed it. <37>
(3) The Effort of Cultivation lies in True Knowledge (眞識). Knowledge from the ears and eyes is insufficient for action to arise. Only after truly knowing and understanding in the mind can one finally manage to act. A person once harmed by a tiger's bite will suddenly change color just hearing the name 'tiger,' but one who has not felt the pain of being bitten will not have their expression suddenly and drastically change like the injured person. The true knowledge of a learner is also like this. Generally, those who act striving (勉强) to accord with the Way definitely cannot persist long. Human nature is originally good, so acting according to principle is natural.
(4) The Key to Cultivation lies in Seated Meditation and Entering Concentration (坐禪入定). The first duty of the learner lies in the mind and will. It is certainly impermissible to try to bring out knowledge from hearing, seeing, and thinking all at once. Only when there is confusion from thoughts (思慮) must one practice seated meditation and enter concentration. The clarity of my mind is like a mirror (鑑), inevitably interacting with all things, and subsequently, one cannot avoid thinking about them. To escape this, one only needs the master of the mind. What is called the master is Reverence (敬); Reverence means focusing on one without deviation (主一無適). The human mind cannot be used for two things at once. If one now trains in focusing on one without deviation, the affliction of confused thoughts will naturally disappear. What the *Changes* calls "Straighten the inner with reverence, square the external with righteousness (敬以直內 義以方外)" is this. Straightening the inner means focusing on one; not anticipating, not being lax, and being unashamed even in the darkest corner of the house (屋漏不愧) are all matters of reverence. If one just preserves this reverence and cultivates it (涵養), Heavenly Principle naturally becomes clear. This is no different from Elder Cheng (大程).
(5) Conclusion on the Theory of Effort. Following the theoretical differences between Mingdao and Ich'ŏn, their efforts of cultivation also differ in aim. Mingdao, being a monist, saw the one reality as the Mind of the Way (道心); removing evil from this Mind of the Way was the goal of cultivation. Ich'ŏn, being a dualist, saw the two realities as the opposing Nature and Qi. Because Qi possessed turbidity, he saw the necessity of investigating principle. Therefore, Mingdao can be called enlightenment-oriented (悟脫的), while Ich'ŏn can be called investigation-of-principle-oriented (窮理的).

Conclusion
Ich'ŏn inherited Mingdao's philosophy and constructed the dualism of Nature and Qi. This was then inherited and developed through Chu Hsi (朱子). In his theory of cultivation, on the one hand, by advocating the investigation of principle, he became one cause for the rise of Lu Hsiang-shan's philosophy. On the other hand, by advocating the theory of the Unity of Knowledge and Action (知行合一論), he induced the philosophy of Wang Yangming (王陽明).

Successors of Cheng Learning
(1) Those emphasizing Mind-Learning (心學) - Hsieh Shang-ts'ai (謝上蔡)... (Mingdao's scholarly style)
(2) Those emphasizing the character 'Nature' (性) - Yang Kuei-shan (楊龜山)... (Ich'ŏn's scholarly style)

A. Hsieh Shang-ts'ai (謝上蔡)
Hsieh Shang-ts'ai's (謝上蔡) given name was Liang-tso (良佐), and his courtesy name was Hsien-tao (顯道). He was from Shang-ts'ai (上蔡) in Shouchun (壽春), hence called Master Shang-ts'ai. <38> He was firm, bright, sincere, and honest, and Mingdao highly praised his character.

Fundamental Thought. Shang-ts'ai's learning received Mingdao's simple and easy (簡易) scholarly style, making the single character 'Mind' (心) its center, and sought to develop this center through the investigation of principle. Therefore, discussing the Mind, he said, "What is Mind? Benevolence (仁) is it. What is Benevolence? That which is alive is Benevolence; that which is dead is non-benevolence (不仁)." This is no different from Mingdao calling Benevolence Primal Qi, Nature, and the Mind of the Way. Continuing his words, he said, "If a person today does not know the numbness, pain, and itching (麻痺痛痒) of their limbs, this is called non-benevolence. If a peach or apricot pit (桃呇之核) is planted and can grow, it is called a peach kernel (桃仁) or apricot kernel (呇仁); this means life (生). Extrapolating from this, one can see Benevolence." Thus, by calling Mind Benevolence and explaining Benevolence concretely, he caused a perception of one's own greatness (尊大). What obscures one's own greatness is human desire. The effort to remove this was then divided into Confucian and Buddhist approaches. Buddhism speaks of seeing one's nature (見性), stopping at knowing what nature is. Then, how do Confucians sweep away human desire? He said it lies solely in the investigation of principle. Although principles are myriad, they ultimately have a unifying core. Therefore, if one investigates the great ones, there will naturally be something that penetrates through. How could one investigate each and every one? This is where Master Hsieh diverges from Mingdao and approaches Buddhist sudden enlightenment (佛門悟入). However, unlike Buddhism, he did not entirely abandon the effort of lower-level learning. His so-called investigation of principle simply required true knowledge (眞知). In essence, Shang-ts'ai interpreted Benevolence concretely, called it Mind and Heaven, thereby making Mind the center of his learning. From his statement, "Buddhist discussion of Nature is like the Confucian discussion of Mind (佛之論性 如儒之論心)," one can see how greatly he valued Mind. As a result of valuing Mind thus, he arrived at the theory of the Unity of Knowledge and Action (知行合一說), consequently esteemed liberation (解脫), and ultimately transcended the bounds of the Sage's Gate (聖門). Thus, this trend of thought is indeed the precursor to Lu Hsiang-shan's learning (陸學).

B. Yang Kuei-shan (楊龜山)
Kuei-shan's (龜山) given name was Shih (時), and his courtesy name was Chung-li (中立). He was from Chiang-lo (將樂) in Nan-chien (南劍). His nature was extremely quick-witted through listening (聽悟), and his demeanor was warm and gentle (溫容婉柔), so Ich'ŏn loved him most. He passed away in the 5th year of Shaohsing (紹興, 1135 CE) at the age of 83. His posthumous name was Wen-ching (文靖). His extant works include *Discerning the Meanings of the Three Classics* (三經義辨), *Recorded Conversations* (語錄), *Collected Works of Kuei-shan* (龜山集), etc. Kuei-shan is called the founder of the Lo School (洛學, Luoyang School) because of the historical connection through Lo Ts'ung-yuan (羅從源) to Li Yen-p'ing (李延平), eventually reaching Chu Hsi (朱子).
(1) Identity of Reverence (敬) and Righteousness (義). When one straightens the inner with reverence, what manifests externally is naturally righteousness. Reverence and righteousness are not separate things. "Where there is reverence, there must be righteousness; where there is righteousness, there must be reverence." There is merely the distinction between internal and external and the division between root and branch.
(2) Kuei-shan believed, "From the sage making the will sincere and rectifying the mind (誠意正心) to ordering the state and bringing peace to the world (治國平天下), the principle is one. It cannot be established as internal and external. Moreover, if one sees the sincerity of will and rectification of mind, one will see that the world is pacified through this."
(3) Goodness of Nature (性善). Master Yang compared the goodness/evil of nature with Buddhism, saying: In Buddhism, the statement that nature is true emptiness (性眞空) departs from humanity; departing from humanity is the so-called <39> stubborn emptiness (頑空通, likely 頑空). It is said that the eighth [consciousness], the Alaya-vijnana (庵麾羅識虛, Āmalavijñāna?), is white, pure, and undefiled (白凈無垢), and the ninth [consciousness], the Alayavijnana (阿賴耶識), holds the seeds of good and evil. The white, pure, and undefiled is precisely Mencius's goodness of nature. Among Yang Kuei-shan's disciples, the only ones worthy of attention are Hu Wu-feng (胡五峰) and Lo Yü-chang (羅豫章, Lo Ts'ung-yuan).

1. Hu Wu-feng (胡五峰) (Biography and Writings)

Hu Wu-feng's (胡五峰) given name was Hung (宏), and his courtesy name was Jen-chung (仁仲). Scholars called him Master Wu-feng (五峰先生). His extant works include *Knowing Words* (知言), poems and prose (詩文), and *Great Record of Emperors and Kings* (皇王大紀).
(a) Nature and Mind. Master Hu said, "The sage, pointing to the substance (體) of the Way, called it Nature (性); pointing to its function (用), called it Mind (心). Nature cannot but be active; when active, it becomes Mind." Thus, Master Hu considered Mind active, distinguishing it from Nature, and regarded only Nature as quiescent.
(b) Nature is Absolute Goodness. In Mingdao's theory, Nature was called Primal Qi. From this, Kuei-shan compared the goodness of nature to the Āmalavijñāna (?) and good/evil to the Ālayavijñāna, meaning the idea of Nature being absolute goodness was included therein. Wu-feng also received this theory, saying, "Nature is the mystery (奧) of Heaven, Earth, ghosts, and spirits." If even 'good' is insufficient to describe it, how much less 'evil'? Furthermore, recalling his late father's words, he said, "Mencius's statement of the goodness of nature was a phrase of admiration (歎美之辭), definitely not contrasting it with evil." This is because it is absolute goodness. What is the meaning of saying Nature is absolute goodness? It means enabling things to be content with their determined lot (定分). His words state, "Perfect! I observe the spiritual way of Heaven and Earth: its timing is without error; endowing form upon the myriad things, whether large or small, each fulfills its lot sufficiently. The Great Harmony (太和) preserves and unites, transforming endlessly. All humans, when born, possess purely (粹然) the mind of Heaven and Earth; the Way and righteousness are complete, without bias or leaning. It cannot be distinguished by good or evil, cannot be divided by right or wrong. There is no excess, no deficiency. This 'Mean' (中) is why it is so named." This passage sufficiently allows one to see his theory of absolute natural goodness.
(c) Mind is Immortal. Mind controls (司配) the activation of Nature. Therefore, failing to hit the mark of moderation (節) lies in the Mind. Then, based on what standard should the Mind be sought? He said it should be based only on the Good Mind (良心). This is an extremely sensitive faculty in humankind, capable of discerning right/wrong and deviant/correct. Therefore, he said, "All people have a good mind. Even if labeled with the name of Jie or Zhou (桀紂, tyrants), even a common man would not accept it." Thus, the center of Master Hu's philosophy is the Mind. From esteeming this Mind, Master Hu said, "Mind has no death or life (心無死生)," and also, "Do not observe the mind with form, but observe the mind with the mind, then you will know it (無以形觀心而以心觀心則知之矣)." In other words, it is nothing other than saying Mind is without birth and death, while form has birth and death.
(d) Conclusion. To summarize this, Mind is an active entity, and its manifestation in action is sometimes good, sometimes evil. Following the Good Mind leads to goodness; letting it go leads to evil. Master Hu's philosophy has the flaw of being close to common sense, but it possesses points of rather <40> clear and sharp analysis.

2. Li Yen-p'ing (李延平) Li Yen-p'ing's (李延平) given name was T'ung (同), and his courtesy name was Yüan-chung (愿中). He was from Nan-chien (南劍). At the age of 24, hearing that Lo Chung-su (羅仲素, Lo Ts'ung-yuan) transmitted the learning of the Lo River (河洛, i.e., Cheng brothers'), he accordingly went to study. Chung-su's character was inherently not one to seek fame in the world. The Master (Li) alone deeply understood this and withdrew, declining worldly affairs for over 40 years. Though his basket and gourd were often empty (簞瓢屢空), he was contentedly self-sufficient. His self-possession (操存) was quite firm, and his cultivation (涵養) became increasingly mature, so his expressions all hit the mark of moderation. He passed away in the 10th month of the first year of Lung-hsing (隆興, 1163 CE) at the age of 71. His extant writings, such as *Yen-p'ing's Questions and Answers* (延平問答) and supplements in Chu Hsi's *Recorded Conversations* (朱子語錄), allow one to see his thought.
a. Fundamental Thought. The primary principle of Yen-p'ing's learning lies in sitting quietly with closed eyes (靜坐暝目), embodying and recognizing (體認) Heavenly Principle, and seeking the Mean (中) within before joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure have arisen (喜怒哀樂未發). After attaining the Mean, nurturing its application is considered the first rule of cultivation. He said, "The Way is not found in much talk. Just sit silently, clarify the mind (澄心), and embody Heavenly Principle. If so, even the arising of a single strand of selfish desire will retreat and be heard (?). If one exerts effort in this for a long time, perhaps one will gradually become clear, and lecturing on learning will then have force." Chu Hsi also said, "Master Yen-p'ing taught people quiet sitting." From this, one can see that his method of learning was close to Zen (禪).
b. Influence on Chu Hsi. When Chu Hsi was 24, he met Yen-p'ing and fluently (滔滔히) expounded his own learning. The Master said, "You talk so much, but you don't understand the matter right before your eyes." In response to this, Chu Hsi suddenly reflected and realized his own learning was insufficient, it is said...

**Summary**

This article, part of a series on the "System of Eastern Learning of the Way" (東洋道學), discusses the Neo-Confucian philosophy of the Cheng brothers, Cheng Hao (程顥, Myŏngdo) and Cheng Yi (程頤, Ich'ŏn), prominent figures in the Song Dynasty. It outlines Cheng Hao's emphasis on Benevolence (仁) as the Primal Qi (元氣) and Nature (性), viewing his philosophy as a monistic system focused on self-cultivation (修身學) through reverence (敬) to recover the original good nature obscured by human desires. It then contrasts this with Cheng Yi's dualistic system, which distinguishes Nature (性, identified with Principle, 理) as inherently good from Qi (氣), whose clarity or turbidity determines individual character (才). Cheng Yi's cultivation method emphasizes the "investigation of principle" (窮理) alongside nurturing Qi. The article traces the lineage and influence of their ideas, particularly Cheng Hao's focus on Mind (心) through Hsieh Shang-ts'ai (謝上蔡) leading towards Lu Hsiang-shan (陸象山), and Cheng Yi's Nature/Qi distinction through Yang Kuei-shan (楊龜山), Hu Wu-feng (胡五峰), and Li Yen-p'ing (李延平) leading towards Chu Hsi (朱子).

From a historical perspective, this 1921 article published in *Kaebyŏk* magazine is significant. It demonstrates that Korean intellectuals during the Japanese colonial period were deeply engaged in analyzing and reinterpreting traditional East Asian philosophy, specifically Neo-Confucianism, seeking to understand its systematic structure ("軆系"). The detailed exposition of complex philosophical concepts and lineages indicates a continued intellectual vitality and an effort to define "Eastern Learning" amidst the pressures of modernization and colonial rule. Historians might find it interesting as evidence of how traditional thought systems were being actively debated and utilized by Korean thinkers to navigate their contemporary situation.

程朱의 學 -大程子
叙論(傳幷書)
程顥의 字는 伯淳이니 河南人이라. 父程珦은 官이 太中太夫에 至하니라. 伯淳을 明道元年에 生하니 幼하야 能言치 못한 바 叔母- 此를 抱하고 行하다가 釵를 不覺中에 見墜한지라. 後數日에 此를 求한대 先生이 手로 指하기 늘 指하는 所에 隨往하니 果然 釵-有하니라. 15歲 時에 弟 伊川과 共히 周茂叔에게 就하야 學하고 此로부터 慨然히 科學의 業을 厭하고 道를 求할 志를 有하엿다 하니라. 元豊8年 6月 15日에 卒하니 年이 54라. 文彦博이 其墓表에 題하야 明道라 하다. 그의 著한 바는 詩文 數十篇의 外에 其他는 別無하고 其說을 見할만한 者는 오즉 語錄이 有하니라.

그의 學統
孔子의 思想은 論語에 在한 바 그 思想의 中心點은 自己人格을 完成함에 在하다. 卽 先王治國의 道를 實行할만한 人格을 養成함에 在하니라. 孔子 沒함에 孟子-獨히 斯學을 繼述하다. 宋代에 學術이 勃興함과 共히 邵子-有하며 周子-有하야 皆 哲學家로써 有名하엿스나 皆 孔子의 意를 得한 與否는 不明한 中 能히 孔子의 意를 得한 者는 程明道其人이라 할지로다. 伊川이 明道의 行狀을 作하야 曰 『先生이 生于千四百年之後得不傳之學於遺經』이라 云함이 適當하도다. 明道의 哲學은 純正哲學이 아니오. 修身學에 在하다. 此는 倫理에 踈하고 實踐을 重히 함으로써라.

倫理論
(1) 仁은 卽 元氣 明道는 性善을 孔子와 調和키 爲하야 苦惱가 甚하얏나니 諸家를 歷問하야 此를 釋코저 하엿도다. 當時 그 思想이 아즉 未定하엿스나 『反求諸六經而得之』라＜32＞ 稱하얏스니 六經이라함은 卽 禮樂詩書易春秋-是니라. 孔子는 一個의 仁을 主張하니 仁의 德됨은 名狀키 不可하야 그 大-無外하고 그 小-無內라. 易에 云한 바 『天地의 大德을 生이라.』하니 故로 仁은 卽 生이라. 此 生은 一元의 氣에 由하야 成行되나니 易에 曰 『乾元된 者-資하야 始한다.』하며 一元의 氣는 卽 仁되지 아님이 不可하니 仁 則 善치 아님이 不可하다. 故로 易에 曰 『元者는 善之長이라. 人物이 皆此 一元의 氣를 受하야 生長하나니 故로 그 性이 善치 아흘 理-無하다.』 하엿도다. 明道-以爲하되 仁은 即 元氣임으로써 善하다 하엿스니 是 即 彼가 善의 基礎를 得하야 荀子를 凌駕하고 孔과 孟을 調和한 바라 하노라. 彼의 一世談說이 필경 此에 歸치 아님이 無하니라.
(2) 性은 卽 元氣 此가 前諸子에 比하야 大히 異한 바 明道의 性說에 最히 注意할 價値가 有한 바니라. 曰 『生之謂性, 性卽氣, 氣卽性, 生之謂也』라 하니 性 卽 氣의 一語는 前款에 論述한 바의 元氣-是니라. 故로 性은 善하다 한다. 又 曰 『人이 氣稟으로 生한 以上은 理에 善惡이 無키 不能하나 然하나 性 中에 元初兩物이 相對하야 生함이 아니라. 幼로부터 善함이 有하고 惡함이 有함은 是- 氣稟의 自然일 뿐이오. 善은 本來 是 性이 됨과 同時에 惡도 亦 性이라 謂치 아님이 不可하다.』 하엿스니 然 則 明道는 性論이 不完全하도다.
(3) 性은 絶對 性은 이미 元氣니 元氣는 宇宙間에 充盈한 者라. 그 絶對됨은 論을 不俟할지로다. 此 觀念을 基底로 하고 所謂 定性書 一篇을 稿하니라. 그 性의 절대를 論함에 曰 『所謂定』이라 함은 動도 亦 定,  靜도 亦 定, 將迎도 無하고 內外도 無하니 苟外物로써 外라 햐야 己를 産하야 此에 從할 時는 是己가 性으로 內外가 有타 함이로다.
(4) 仁은 絶對 仁은 元氣 即 性됨으로써 그 絶對됨은 再言을 不得할지라. 但 性은 元氣를 靜적으로 觀하고 仁은 元氣를 的으로 觀함에 不外하니 彼의 識仁篇은 此觀念을 基底로 하고 論한 者라. 그 仁의 絶對를 論함에 曰 『仁은 渾然하야 物과 軆를 同包하니 義禮智信이 皆仁이라.』하고 又 醫家의 比喩로써 說하야 曰 『醫書의 手足痿痺가 卽 不仁이라.』하니 此言이 最히 善名이라 謂치 아니치 못하리로다. 仁者는 天地萬物로써 一軆가 되니 己-아님이 無하야 手足이 不仁할 時는 全身 軆의 氣 亦 貰通치 못하야 己에 屬치 아니하나니 故로 『博施濟衆은 聖人의 功用이라.』한다. 然則 仁이 一貫的 宇宙의 絶對되는 意-此에서 見할지로다. 二程의 語仁을 說한 者-凡數十條에 一도 斯意-아님이 無하도다.＜33＞
(5) 心 宇宙乾元의 氣는 性이니 卽 仁이라. 故로 形은 道지 아니치 못할지라. 曰 『道 即 性 若道外尋性 性外尋道 便不是聖賢論天德)이라하다. 然하면 彼의 心에 關한 見解는 如何한가 問하면 卽 人心, 道心의 別이 有한 者라 할지라. 道心은 그 本性으로 言 卽 天理라. 天理는 即 道니 唯人欲이 蔽할 時는 天德을 忘함에 至하는 故로 人欲을 除할 時는 心 即 天理가 되나니 凡心은 活動的 物이라. 그 存在에서 力學的이 되지 아니치 못할지니 今明道 所謂 大理는 性으로 卽 元氣니 心도 亦 元氣로써 力學的 實在라 하나니라.
倫理論의 結言 天地의 生起를 仁이라하고 人에 在하얀 此를 性, 道, 道心이라하니 故로 道心은 人으로써는 同치 아님이 無하고 聖人의 傳한 바 斯心에서 出치 아님이 無하니 此 卽 絶對로써 그 天眞을 發揮하는 바 法은 知左하다.

그의 工夫論
修爲의 工夫는 主一無適에 在함. 各人의 性은 本是 圓滿 具足한 者니 孟子 所謂 『萬物皆備於我』의 言이 果然하다. 오즉 그 人欲이 遏蔽함으로 그 本來의 善性이 自己의 光明을 發揮함을 不得하나니 故로 修爲의 工夫는 人慾을 去하고 홀로 公共의 道心만 存케 함에 在할 뿐이다. 然則 그 法은 오즉 敬으로써 心을 治함에 在하니라. 敬할 時는 天然의 妙質이 그대로 發現되나니 曰 『主一無適 敬以直內 便有浩然之氣 浩然, 湏要實識 得他剛大 直不習 無不利』라 하니라.
(1) 修爲의 道는 爲學에 在함 生하야 知하는 者는 世에 其人이 少하다. 大抵 그 性을 蔽하는 人欲의 害를 防코저하면 卽 爲學의 必用이 是라 爲學이라함은 下로 人事를 學하고 上으로 天理에 到達함이니 한갓 空文浮言을 弄함은 아니라. 故로 曰 『學者湏學之, 知道者進德而已, 有德則不習, 無不利, 未有學養子而後嫁 盖先得是道矣, 學文之功, 學得一事, 是一事, 二事, 是二事, 觸類, 至于百千, 至窮盡, 亦只是學』이라하니 此로써 그 所謂 爲學의 何者됨을 可見하겟도다.
(2) 修爲의 工夫는 內外를 忘함에 在함 性의 大-內外를 絶하니 故로 吾人은 心을 動치 勿하고 靜的으로 是非를 洞察하야 我로써 喜怒치 勿하고 物로써 喜怒할지니 此 意는 定性書後半에 在하니라. 曰 『夫天地之常以其心普萬物而無心, 聖人之常, 以其情順萬事而無情, 故, 君子之學, 莫若廓然而大公, 物來而順應』이라하고 易에 曰 『艮其背, 不獲其身, 行其庭, 不見其人』이라하며 孟子曰 『所惡於智者爲鑿也, 與其非外而是內, 不若內外之兩忘,＜34＞ 兩忘則澄然無事, 無事則定 定則明, 明則尙何應物之爲累哉, 聖人之喜, 以物之當喜, 聖人之怒, 以物之當怒, 是, 聖人之喜怒, 不係於心而係於物』이라 하엿도다. 然則修爲의 工夫는 皆我의 主觀的 되는 情을 制하야 彼의 客觀的 되는 理에 隨由하는 所以니라.
(3) 修爲의 工夫는 仁을 識함에 在함 此는 仁의 絶對되는 事를 知하고 後에 此를 軆認함을 謂함이라. 故로 曰 『學者湏先識仁, 仁者揮然與物同軆, 義禮智, 皆統於仁識得此理, 以識敬存之而已, 不湏防檢, 不湏窮索, 若心懈則有防心, 苟不懈, , 何防之有, 理有未得故, 湏窮索存久自明, 安待窮索, 此道與物無對, 其大, 不足以名之』로다.
(4) 工夫論의 終言 以上四者는 工夫의 綱領뿐이니 前 二者는 去邪를 基하고 軆認을 基하니라. 彼가 修爲法을 佛家에서 學得하야 反히 佛家와 相異함은 修爲에 在하야 下學과 上達을 必然的으로 同一케 하엿스나 佛家는 下學의 一條를 廢하고 但 見性成佛만 唱導하니 此 點에서 佛家의 修爲는 社會에 無益하고 儒家의 修爲는 社會에 有益하니라.

結論
明道의 哲學은 工夫의 方面으로는 破綻을 見치 못하겟스나 理論의 方面으로는 決코 成功하엿다. 謂키 不可하니 卽 性에 善惡이 有한 바 說이 明正精確함을 得치 못함으로써-라. 次에 明道哲學의 主要한 點을 擧하면 左와 如하니 (1) 元氣는 即 性이라함이요. (2) 道心은 即 性 卽 天理라 함이로다. 然한데 그 弱点을 補한 者는 明道의 弟伊川이라한다. 第一主點을 繼紹한 者는 楊龜山을 經하야 胡五峰에 至하고 第二主點을 繼紹한 者는 謝上蔡에 傳하야 陸象山에 至하엿나니라.


小程子(傳幷書)
程伊川의 名은 頣요. 字는 正叔이니 河南人이라. 伊水上에 在한 故로 伊川이라하다. 明道의 弟니 高識이 有하야 禮-아니면 動치 아니하고 18歲 時에 闕下에 上書하야 仁宗으로 하여곰 王道와 重大함을 勸하니라. 大觀元年 9月에 卒하니 年이 75라. 嘉定13年에 謚하야 正公이라하니 基著한 바 易傳 4卷, 宋志 9卷, 時文 數十篇이 有하나 그의 哲學思想을 可見할 만한 者는 但 語錄뿐이다. 二程學問이 相同한 者는 그 經歷이 同함에 歸한 者로되 伊川의 學源을 不可不明道에게 淵源하엿다고 假定치 아니치 못할지라. 故로 吾人은 浩澣한 二程全書中에 就하야 오즉 明道와 相異한 點만 論코저하노라.

性과 氣＜35＞

明道는 性善을 說明함과 共히 그 惡의 由來를 說明코저 하다가 失敗한 바 曰 『人生氣禀 理有善惡』이라 하엿나니 此에 伊川이 明言하야 曰 『人性은 皆善하나 但 氣에淸과 濁이 有하니 淸氣를 禀한 자는 生하야 善人이 되고 濁氣를 禀한 자는 惡人이 되나니라. 性은 善理로써 善惡이 有함은 即 才라.』하고 又 曰 『性出於天 才出於氣 氣淸則才淸 氣濁則才濁 才則有善 有不善 性則無不善』이라하다. 更히 性의 普遍的 善으로써 各人에 平等한 바를 說하야 曰 『性無不善而有不善者才也 性卽理 理則自堯舜 至於途人一也 才禀於氣 氣有淸濁 禀其淸者爲賢禀其濁者爲愚』라 하니라. 此에 至하야 性과 氣는 分明하야 性善論이 必定하엿다 할지로다.
(1) 性의 動 性은 卽 理니 抽象的, 形式的이 아니요. 力學的이니라. 故로 性은 發動할만한 者니 發動할 時는 此를 情이라 한다. 性은 絶對 善하나 情은 그 宜를 得키 不能하니라. 然이나 此로써 情은 不善이라 云키 不可하다. 或 人이 性善 情不善의 問에 對하야 『情者는 性動也 要歸之正而已 亦何得以不善名之』아 하엿스니 情으로써 性의 動이라하면 그 不善이 無함은 明白하니라. 然則 情은 先天的 腦膸的으로 善치 아님이 不可하도다.
(2) 性卽心 伊川은 玆에 至하야 性 卽 心이라 道破하니 曰 『孟子曰盡其心者 知其性 心卽性也』라 하얏다. 然則 性과 心은 如何한 意味에서 相異한가? 함이 疑問이라 此에 對하야 曰 『在天爲命 在義爲理 在人爲性主於身爲心一也』라 하다. 然하면 命, 理, 性, 心이 皆道의 異方面에 不外한 바 道는 卽 活動的이라. 萬物을 生成하는 바의 本體인 故로 心은 本體가 되지 아님이 不可하도다.
(3) 心은 本體니라. 心은 生成하는 바의 本體니 故로 曰 『心生道也 有是心 卽 具是形以生 惻隱之心 人之生道也』라 하며 心은 絶對니라. 故로 又 曰 『一人之心 即 天地之心』이라하니 此点에서 即 明道 伊川이 一致하엿다 하겟도다. 心은 本體로써 萬理를 具備하니라. 此點에서 又有名한 沖漠無朕 說이 有하니 曰 『沖漠無朕 萬象森然已具 未應 不是先 已應 不是後 如百尺之木 自根本 至枝葉 皆是一貫 不合道上面一段事 無形無兆却待人旋安排 引入來 敎入塗轍』이라하니 盖理는 心에 備하얏스나 內가 아니라. 踏하야 行할만하고 又外가 아니라. 沖漠하야 痕跡을 見할만한 者-無함으로써라. 卽 日常彝倫의 道로써 酒, 掃, 慮對로부터 忠孝一切의 道에 至하기까지 皆是니라.
(4) 知識 心은 理요. 氣는 形而下니 大小限界가 有함을＜36＞ 不免할지라. 物의 生함은 氣의 凝集이요. 物의 滅함은 氣의 披散이라. 故로 個別原理는 畢竟 氣에 在하니 曰 『物之名義與氣 理通 貫天之所以爲天 本何爲哉 蒼蒼爲耳矣 其所以名之曰天 盖自然之理也 名出於理 音出於氣 宇宙由是而不可勝窮』이라하다. 又 彼가 氣에 淸濁이 有함으로써 各物의 差別은 理가 아니요. 氣에 在하다함은 最히 可觀할 點이니 此-朱子學의 濫觴이로다.
彼가 理와 氣를 區別하야 知識에도 亦 聞見(學而知之)의 知와 德性(黙念而通)의 知가 有하다 하엿나니 所謂 聞見의 智는 氣에 屬하야 限이 有함을 不免하고 德性의 知는 理에 屬하야 大小廣狹이 有한 事-無하니 曰 『聞見之智 非德性之智 物交物則知之非內也 今之所謂博學多能者是也 德性之智不假聞見』이라하엿다. 所謂 勉치 안코 中하면 思치 안코 得하는 者는 此德性의 智가 有함으로써라.
(5) 性氣의 結言 伊川이 性卽理라 斷言하야 氣에 淸濁이 有하다 規定하고 性과 氣의 區別을 截然케하야 氣로써 形而下라하고 性으로써 形而上이라 하엿다. 然이나 力學的 實在가 된다하야 此를 心과 同一케함과 同時에 冲漠無朕說을 成하니라. 又 性卽心이며 本軆라 하엿스나 그 發現은 旣存한 氣를 通하야 逐成됨으로써 그 哲學的 立脚地는 二元論이니 決코 唯一의 心이 發現하야써 宇宙萬物을 生成하엿다함이 아니라 此가 明道와 異한 바-니 明道의 哲學은 性으로써 即 元氣가 된다 한 바의 一元論이니라.

工夫論
(1) 修爲는 氣를 養함에 在함 伊川은 氣의 淸濁이 有하다 한고로 修爲의 目的은 그 濁한 者를 修治함에 在하니 曰 『氣에 淸濁이 有하고 性은 即 不善이 無하다. 孟子의 養浩然之氣는 此를 養함이니 至極의 點에 達하면 淸明純全하야 昏塞한 바의 惡을 去한다.』하다. 然하면 此를 養하는 바 法은 何에 在한가? 曰 『寡欲』이라 하니라.
(2) 修爲의 工夫는 窮理에 在함 伊川이 以爲하되 『窮理를 積하면 然後에 脫然하야 了할 바-有하니 一個의 事에만 着目하야 窮理의 效를 終한다함이 不可하다』하엿스니 伊川이 此 意를 說한 바-凡數回에 그의 根本思想임을 可知하겟다. 窮理의 法을 分하야 三이라하니 『一曰書를 讀하야 義理를 講明함이오. 二曰古今人物을 論하야 그 시비를 別함이요. 三曰事物應接하야 其當에 處함』이라 是明道의 趣旨와 異한바-니 그 聞見이 知에 屬함으로써 象山이 極히 反對하니라.＜37＞
(3) 修爲의 工夫는 眞識에 在함 耳目의 識은 行의 發함에 不足하니 眞히 心에 知了한 後에야 비롯오 行에 發함을 得할지로다. 一次虎에게 嚙牙의 害를 蒙한 人은 虎의 名을 聞하고도 顔色이 忽變하나 尙히 嚙牙의 痛傷을 感치안는 者는 傷者와 如히 神色이 忽然 激變치 아니하도다. 學者의 眞知도 亦 斯와 如하야 大抵 勉强하야 道에 合코저 行動하는 者는 決코 永續키 不能하니라. 人의 性이 本善하니 理에 循하야 行함이 順하니라.
(4) 修爲의 要는 坐禪入定에 在함 學者의 先務는 心志에 在하니 聞見知思를 幷出코저 하여도 固不可하다. 오즉 思慮의 紛亂이 有할 時는 반듯이 坐禪入定할지니 我心의 明은 鑑과 如하야 萬物의 交感치 아님이 無하고 隨하야 此로써 思慮케 안할 事-不能하니 若 此를 免코저 하면 唯心의 主를 要할 뿐이다. 所謂 主라함은 敬이오. 敬은 主一無適을 云함이니 人心은 二用키 不可하도다. 今主一無適을 習鍊하면 即 思慮紛亂의 患이 自然消滅할지니 易에 所謂 『敬以直內 義以方外』라 한 者-是니라. 直內는 主一의 義니 不期不慢하야 屋漏不愧가 皆敬의 事니라. 但此敬을 存하야 涵養할 時는 自然히 天理가 明한다하니 此는 大程과 異한 事-無하니라.
(5) 工夫論의 結言 明道·伊川이 理論의 相異함에 從하야 修爲의 工夫도 目異하나니 明道는 一元論인바 그 一元은 卽 道心이니 此 道心의 邪惡을 除排함은 修爲工夫의 目的이오. 伊川은 二元論인바 그 二元은 對等的인 性과 氣니라. 氣에 濁함이 有한 故로 窮理의 必要를 見하니라. 然한즉 明道는 悟脫的이오. 伊川은 窮理的이라 할 만 하도다.

結論
伊川은 明道哲學을 繼하야 性氣의 二元을 建設하니 是則 朱子를 由하야 繼紹開發된 者니라. 修爲論에 一方으로는 窮理를 主張하야 象山哲學을 勃起케 한 一原因이라 하겟고 又 一方으로는 知行合一論을 唱하야 王陽明哲學을 誘起케 하니라.

程學의 後繼
(1) 心學에 重을 措한 者-謝上蔡...(明道의 學風)
(2) 性字에 重을 措한 者-楊龜山...(伊川의 學風)

甲, 謝上蔡
謝上蔡의 名은 良佐요. 字는 顯道니 壽春上蔡人이라. 고로 上蔡선생이라＜38＞ 稱하다. 剛明誠實하야 明道가 頗히 其人됨을 讚하니라.

根本思想 上蔡의 學은 明道의 簡易學風을 受하야 心一字로써 中心을 삼고 窮理에 由하야 此中心을 開發코저 하엿나니 故로 其心을 論함에 曰 『心者何也 仁是己 仁者何也 活者爲仁 死者爲不仁』이라 하엿스니 此-明道의 仁으로써 元氣라하고 性이라하며 道心이라 함과 異치 아니한 바 更히 語를 繼하야 曰 『今人이 耳軆의 痲痺痛痒을 不知하면 此를 不仁이라 謂할지라. 桃呇의 核를 種하야 生할만한 者면 此를 桃仁, 呇仁이라 謂하나니 即 生의 意니 此를 推하야 仁을 見할만 하다.』 하엿도다. 此와 如히 心을 仁이라하고 仁을 具體的으로 說한 結果는 自己의 尊大를 感知케 하엿다. 自己의 尊大를 弊한 者는 人欲이니 此를 去하는 工夫를 乃儒佛에 分하야 佛은 見性이라 云하야 性의 何者됨을 知함에 止하니라. 然하면 儒家의 人欲을 掃함은 如何한가 曰 窮理에 在할 뿐이다. 理는 萬殊하나 畢竟 統一總腦한 바 有하니 故로 其大한 者를 究하면 自然히 貫通할 바 有할지라. 豈一一이 此를 究하랴. 此-謝子가 明道에 距하야 佛門悟入에 近한 處니라. 然하나 佛家와 如히 全혀 下學의 工夫를 廢함이 아니오. 그 所謂 窮理란 者는 眞知를 要할 뿐이라. 要컨대 上蔡는 具體的으로 仁을 解釋하야 心이라하고 天이라함으로써 心이 其學의 中心이 되엇나니 그의 『佛之論性 如儒之論心』이라 言한 者로 보아도 如何히 彼가 心을 重大視하엿슴을 可知할지로다. 如斯히 心을 重히 한 結果는 彼로 하여금 知行合一說에 到達케 하고 딸아 解脫을 尙하야 畢竟 聖門의 範圍外에 超脫케 하엿다. 然則 此 學問의 思潮는 恰然히 陸學의 先驅로다.

乙, 楊龜山
龜山의 名은 時요. 字는 中立이니 南釵將樂의 人이라. 其性이 極히 聽悟하고 溫容婉柔하야 伊川이 最愛하다. 紹與5年에 卒하니 年 83이라. 謚曰 文靖이라하다. 其著한 바는 三經義辨, 語錄, 龜山集 等이 有하니 龜山이 洛學의 始祖라 稱함은 歷史的 關係에 羅從源을 經하야 李延平에 至하야디 되어 朱子에 至하엿슴으로 써-라.
(1) 敬과 義의 同一 敬으로써 內를 直할 時는 發하야 外에 表한 者-自然義니 敬義는 別物이 아니라 『敬必有義 有義必有敬』이니 伹內外의 別과 本末의 分이 有할 뿐이다.
(2) 龜山은 以爲하되 『聖人이 誠意正心으로부터 治國平天下에 至하기까지 其理-一이니 內外에 立키 不可하고 또 그 誠意正心을 見하면 天下-此에 由하야 平함을 見하겟다.』하엿도다.
(3) 性善 楊子는 佛敎와 性善惡을 比하야 曰 佛敎에 性眞空이라 云한 者는 人을 離함이요. 人을 離함은 所謂＜39＞ 頑空通이라. 第八庵麾羅識虛에 白凈無垢라 云하고 第九阿賴耶識은 善惡의 種子를 云하엿스니 白凈無垢는 即 孟子의 性善이 是로다. 然한데 楊龜山의 門人에 注意할만한 者는 唯胡五峰, 羅豫章의 二人이로다.

1. 胡五峰(傳幷書)

胡五峰의 名은 宏이오. 字는 仁仲이니 學者-五峰先生이라 하다. 그의 著書로는 知言, 詩文, 皇王大紀가 有하니라.
(가) 性과 心 胡子曰 『聖人이 道의 體를 指하야 性이라 云하고 其用을 指하야 心이라 云하니 性은 動치 안키 不能하야 動하면 卽 心이 된다.』 하엿스니 胡子는 心으로써 活動的이라하야 此를 性으로부터 分하고 오즉 性으로써 靜한 者라 하다.
(나) 性은 絶對의 善이니라. 明道의 說에 性은 所謂 元氣라 하엿다. 此에서 龜山은 性善으로써 庵麾羅의 此하고 善惡으로써 阿賴耶識에 比하니 卽 性의 絶對의 善된 思想은 其中에 包含되엇다. 五峰이 亦 其說을 受하니 曰 『性天地鬼神之奧』라 善으로써도 此를 言키 不足하거던 况惡이랴하고 更히 그 先君子의 言을 聽하여 曰 『孟子- 性善을 道함은 歎美의 辭-오. 決코 惡과 對함이 아니라.』 하니 그 絶對 善됨으로써니라. 性으로써 絶對 善이라 한 바 意는 何者인가? 乃物로써 그 定分에 滿足케 함으로써-라. 其言에 曰 『至哉吾觀天地之神道, 其時無愆, 賦形萬物, 無大無細, 各足其分, 太和保合, 變化無窮也, 凡人之生, 粹然天地之心, 道義完具, 無適無莫, 不可以善惡辨, 不可以是非分, 無過也, 無不及也, 此中所以名也』라 하엿스니 此一節로써 能히 그의 絶對 性善의 說을 可히 見할 수가 足하도다.
(다) 心은 不死니라. 性의 發動을 司配하는 心이니 故로 節에 中치 안는다함은 心에 在하니라. 然하면 心은 何에 標準하야 求하여야 可할고. 曰 此를 良心에 本할 뿐이다. 是-人類에 極히 機敏한 機關으로써 能히 是非邪正을 鑑別하는 者라. 고로 曰 『人皆有良心, 被之以桀紂之名, 雖匹夫라도 不受也』라 하니라. 然하면 胡子哲學의 中心은 즉 心이니 胡子-此心을 尙함으로부터 曰 『心無死生』이라하고 又 爲 『無以形觀心而以心觀心則知之矣』라 하니 更言하면 心은 生死가 無하고 形은 死生이 有하다함에 不外하도다.
(나) 結論 此를 要컨대 心은 活動的 物로써 그 行爲에 發한 바- 或 善 或 惡하나니 良心에 從하면 善하고 放하면 惡하다 한다. 胡子의 哲學은 常識에 近한 嫌이 有하나 頗히 ＜40＞分析明快한 點이 有하니라.

2, 李延平 李延平의 名은 同요. 字는 愿이니 南劒人이라. 年 24에 羅仲素-河洛의 學을 傳한다함을 聞하고 遂往學하니 仲素의 爲人이 本來 世에 名을 求치 아니한 者라. 先生이 獨히 此를 深契하고 退屛하야 世事를 謝絶한 事- 40餘年에 簞瓢-屢空하되 恰然自適하야 操存이 頗固하고 涵養이 益熟하야 發而皆中節하니라. 隆興元年 10月에 卒하니 年이 71이라. 其著한 바 書는 延平問答 及 朱子語錄等에 付하야 그 思想을 見할만 하니라.
가, 根本思想 延平學問의 第一義는 靜坐暝目하고 天理를 軆認하야 喜怒哀樂이 아즉 發치 안는 內에서 其中을 求함에 在하다. 其中을 求得한 연후에 此를 發用함을 涵養의 法에 第一이라하니 曰 『問之道, 不在多言, 但黙坐澄心, 體認天理, 若是, 雖一毫私欲之發, 亦退聽矣, 久用力於此, 庶幾漸明, 講學始有力』이라하니라. 朱子亦曰 『延平先生이 人의 靜坐를 敎하엿다.』하나니 此로써 그 學問의 方法이 禪에 近함을 能히 見하겟도다.
나, 朱子에 對한 影響 朱子-24歲의 時에 延平을 見하고 滔滔히 自家의 所學을 吐露한대 先生이 謂曰 『子-許多히 說하나 面前의 事를 不解한다.』함에 對하야 朱子-忽然 反省하야 即 自家의 所學이 不足타 함을 自覺하엿다 한다...
