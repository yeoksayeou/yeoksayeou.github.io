▲Company Announcement▲

It is regrettable, but in this issue, we cannot continue the serialization of the "Hamlet" (하믈레트) script from the previous issue. This is due to reporter Mr. Hyŏn Ch'ŏl's (玄哲 氏) failure to recover his health, so we hope for everyone's forgiveness, understanding the circumstances (事情).

**Summary**

The Editorial Department of Kaebyŏk Publishing Company announces that the serialization of the "Hamlet" script is suspended for the current issue (No. 12, June 1, 1921) because the reporter responsible, Mr. Hyŏn Ch'ŏl, has not recovered from health problems. They apologize to the readers and ask for their understanding. From a historical perspective, this notice is interesting as it documents the early engagement with and dissemination of Western literature (specifically Shakespeare) in colonial Korea through popular magazines. It also highlights the practical challenges faced by publications, such as reliance on individual contributors like Hyŏn Ch'ŏl, whose health could impact content delivery.
