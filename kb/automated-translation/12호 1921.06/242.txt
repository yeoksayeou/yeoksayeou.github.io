Article Title: 創刊 一週年 記念 增大號 發行 (Announcement of the Publication of the Enlarged First Anniversary Commemorative Issue)
Article Type: 사고·편집후기 (Notice/Editorial Postscript)

We are delighted. With the coming July 1st, we will be publishing this magazine's First Anniversary Commemorative Issue. Looking back, the first issue of this magazine was founded on June 25th last year under the joint protection of God and Man. As we all consider, how easy is it these days, sitting in our places, to resolutely carry out anything, big or small? Our company has not been without facing various difficulties from time to time, but when we think of how we were able to endure and reach today through successive issue publications, we cannot help but feel some measure of deep emotion. However, how could this be solely due to our own strength? It is only because the careful guidance of various esteemed members of society and the warm affection of many comrades within and without have directly and indirectly intertwined and combined with our meager strength that we have reached today. Therefore, we express our gratitude for the generous goodwill of society in general and, with the intention of celebrating our company's prosperity, we are publishing this First Anniversary Commemorative Enlarged Issue. We do not intend to leak the contents of the commemorative issue in advance now, but to speak of just one aspect of the plan, it goes without saying that there will be the announcement of the poll for great figures and the prize-winning essays, which are currently being solicited. Furthermore, works by various specialists concerning the construction of a New Culture in politics, religion, morality, literature, thought, social systems, and other various fields will be published, and similar content. We believe the contents will surely exceed everyone's expectations, so we ask that you wait with joyful hearts.

**Summary**

This editorial postscript announces the upcoming publication of the first-anniversary enlarged issue of the magazine *Kaebyŏk* (개벽), scheduled for July 1st, 1921. It reflects on the challenges faced during its first year of publication, expresses gratitude to supporters, and highlights key features of the commemorative issue, including the results of a reader poll for "great figures," prize-winning essays, and articles by specialists on various aspects of building a "New Culture." For historians, this piece offers insight into the publishing realities and cultural aspirations of Korean intellectuals during the colonial period. The mention of overcoming "difficulties" hints at potential censorship or financial struggles under Japanese rule, while the focus on "New Culture" (新文化) and reader engagement through polls reflects the active intellectual discourse and nation-building efforts occurring through print media at the time.
