From the Editorial Department

To those participating in the Great Person Poll (偉人投票), we offer a word: when you vote, please do not write only one person, but be sure to include people from each designated field as specified. Also, even for the same elected person, it is good for them to be announced with many votes, so we hope you will vote abundantly.

Regarding the article titled "A Brief Look at the P'yŏngbuk Region Amidst Drastic Change," as seen in the reporter's preface, it is merely a record of partial observations seen briefly in a short period, written just as the reporter thought. It is certainly not the full picture (全豹) of the P'yŏngbuk region, and it is naturally questionable whether or not that one reporter's brief observation is the true representation of the local reality.

Finally, one last word we wish to say is that during the editing of this 12th issue, the colleagues (同人) of our company had various difficult personal circumstances (一身上에 여러가지 難事情), and thus passed the time with difficulty and busyness. It seems likely there were points that were not thorough enough due to this. Regarding this, we especially hope to receive much reprimand (叱責) from everyone. <150>

**Summary**

The editorial department addresses readers about an ongoing "Great Person Poll," urging them to vote for candidates across all categories and to cast many votes. It clarifies that a recent article on the P'yŏngbuk region represents only a brief, potentially incomplete, personal observation by the reporter, not the definitive reality. The editors conclude by apologizing for any shortcomings in the current issue, attributing them to personal difficulties and busy schedules among the staff, and asking for readers' understanding and critique. This piece is interesting for colonial history as it reveals the magazine engaging readers through a poll (potentially fostering national consciousness by identifying "great" Koreans), hints at significant events or turmoil ("drastic change") in the northern P'yŏngbuk region (a border area often site of resistance), and openly acknowledges the operational difficulties ("difficult circumstances") faced by the Korean press under Japanese rule.
