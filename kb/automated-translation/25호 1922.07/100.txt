壬戌之秋 七月
						李鍾麟

This year happens to be the Imsul (壬戌) year, and this month is also the 7th month. Thus, the phrase "壬戌之秋七月 蘇子與客泛舟遊於赤壁之下" (In the autumn of the Imsul year, the seventh month, Master Su and his guest floated in a boat below the Red Cliff) comes to mind. However, this Imsul year is the worst possible year for us people of the East (東洋). The Great Sage of China (中國), Confucius (孔子), passed away in the 4th month of this year [by the lunar calendar, likely referring to 479 BCE, which was indeed an Imsul year]. Mr. Son Ŭiam (孫義菴先生), who possessed the most magnificent tail-end flourish (掉尾之壯) in the 4,000-year history of Chosŏn (朝鮮) across all aspects of religion, politics, and revolution, passed away in the 5th month of this year [1922]. What sorrow and terror the Imsul year has brought us! It seems that among us now, those who merely speak slogans like "20th Century" or "New Trends," that is, those whose fervor for admiring Europe (拜歐熱) is currently flourishing, know that this year is 1222 in the Western calendar [Note: 1922, not 1222], but few seem to know that it is the Imsul year of the 72nd cycle (第 72朞) after the founding of Chosŏn by Tan'gun (朝鮮檀紀). Conversely, among the elders in whose minds the fervor for admiring China (慕華熱) is still considerable, there are almost none (殆無) who know that this was the Imsul year when Kaesomun (蓋蘇文) of our Koguryŏ (高句麗) greatly defeated the million-strong army of the Tang (唐) general Pang Hyot'ae (龐孝泰) at the Sasu River (蛇水) [Note: This event involved Eulji Mundeok, not Yeon Gaesomun, and occurred in 612, a different Imsul year], or the Imsul year of the 36th year of King Munjong (文宗) of Koryŏ (高麗) when Japan (日本) sent envoys to pay tribute (遣使來貢) to us [1082 CE]. Many only know this year and this month as the one when Su Tungp'o (蘇東坡) of the Song (宋) dynasty floated a boat and amused himself on the Chŏkpyŏk River (赤壁江). Looking at it today, one might say that admiring Europe is somewhat better (差勝) than admiring China, but in the sense of knowing the genealogy of others' houses (남의 집 譜學) while being ignorant of one's own house's genealogy (제집 譜學), aren't both sides the same (一般)? However, for us who know so little, and not only know little but also make no effort to learn, isn't knowing something, even if it's about others, better than knowing nothing at all?

Knowing this year, this month, the autumn of Imsul, 7th month, merely as Su Tungp'o's year and month is acceptable enough, but if one is to know, wouldn't it be better to go one step further and learn in detail what kind of person Su Tungp'o was, how many years have passed from that Imsul year to this Imsul year, and also what events occurred in our Chosŏn in that year? <83>

Tungp'o's Imsul year was 823 years before the present [from 1922, placing it in 1099 CE, but the Red Cliff ode was written in 1082 CE], that is, the 5th year of Emperor Yingzong (英宗) of Song, the 36th year of [King Munjong of] Koguryŏ [Note: Koryŏ, not Koguryŏ. 1082 CE was Munjong's 36th year]. That year was precisely the Imsul year when Japan sent envoys to pay tribute. The writer was also once a person in the very last seat of the China-admiring class (慕華班 最末席). Therefore, I wish to introduce the outline of Tungp'o's biography (本傳大略) and the *Former Ode on the Red Cliff* (前赤壁賦), "壬戌之秋七月," which has left an impression on us for 800 years, just as they are, to buy a smile (一笑) from all readers. Additionally, I earnestly hope that you will not forget that July 1st of the coming autumn of Imsul, 7th month, was the 2nd anniversary of the founding of the Chosŏn Kaebyŏk Magazine (朝鮮 開闢雜誌 創刊 第2周年 紀念日) and will commemorate it forever.

**Outline Biography of Tungp'o (東坡本傳畧)**

Su Shih (蘇軾). Style name (字) Tzu-chan (子瞻). A native of Mei-shan (眉山). Shih was precocious and discerning from childhood (幼. 穎悟有識). By the time he reached adulthood (比冠), he was broadly versed in the classics and histories (博通經史), favoring the writings of Chia I (賈誼), Lu Chih (陸贄), and Chuang Tzu (莊子). In the second year of the Chia-yu era of Song (宋嘉祐二年) [1057 CE], he took the examination administered by the Board of Rites (試禮部). Ou-yang Hsiu (歐陽修) placed him second. Later, in an essay examination on the Spring and Autumn Annals (春秋對義), he ranked first. In the palace examination (殿試), he passed in the second class (中乙科). Afterwards, he presented his writings (書) to Hsiu. Hsiu remarked to Mei Sheng-yü (梅聖兪), "I ought to yield to this man and let him stand out (吾當避此人. 出一頭地)." Emperor Ying-tsung (英宗) heard of his fame and wished to summon him to the Hanlin Academy (翰林) as an Edict Compiler (知制誥) following Tang (唐) precedent. Chancellor Han Ch'i (韓琦) said, "Shih is a vessel of great potential (遠大器). He will naturally be of use to the empire in the future. The court must cultivate him. If we employ him abruptly now, the scholars of the empire may not necessarily approve. It would only serve to burden him." Shih, hearing Ch'i's words, said, "The Duke can truly be said to love men with virtue (公可謂愛人, 以德矣)." Wang An-shih (王安石) came to power (執政) and wished to change the civil service examinations (變科擧) and promote schools (興學校). An edict ordered the Two Drafting Offices (兩制) and Three Institutes (三舘) to deliberate. Shih submitted his opinion (議上). Emperor Shen-tsung (神宗) summoned him for an audience that very day. Shih said, "Your Majesty is endowed by Heaven with civil and military talents (天縱文武). There is no concern about Your lack of insight, diligence, or decisiveness. The only concern is Your excessive haste in seeking governance (求治太急), listening too broadly to advice (聽言太廣), and promoting people too rapidly (進人太銳). I wish You would remain calm and tranquil (鎭以安靜), wait for matters to arise, and then respond to them." The Emperor was startled (悚然) and said, "I shall reflect deeply on this (朕當熟思之)." An-shih was displeased (不悅) and appointed Shih as Provisional Judicial Officer of the Kaifeng Prefecture (權開封府推官), intending to burden him with duties. Shih resolved cases with precision and acuity (決斷精敏), and his reputation spread even further. At that time, An-shih was creating new laws (創新法). Shih submitted a memorial discussing them (上書論之). Shih met An-shih and criticized the Emperor for acting autocratically (獨斷) and delegating excessively (專任). Consequently, during the examination for advanced scholars (試進士), he set an essay question (發策): Emperor Wu of Chin (晉武), in pacifying Wu (平吳), acted decisively and succeeded (獨斷而克); Fu Chien (苻堅), in attacking Chin (代晉), acted decisively and perished (獨斷而亡); Duke Huan of Ch'i (齊桓), relying solely on Kuan Chung (管仲), became a hegemon (專任 管仲而覇); King K'uai of Yen (燕噲), relying solely on Tzu-chih (子之), was defeated (專任子之而敗). The circumstances were similar, yet the outcomes differed; he asked why. An-shih grew increasingly angry (滋怒) and had Censor Hsieh Ching-wen (謝景溫) submit a memorial denouncing his faults (論奏其過). An exhaustive investigation yielded nothing (窮治無所得). (Abbreviated - original text) [Shih] was transferred to govern Hu-chou (徙知湖州). At that time, censors accused him of slander (訕謗) through satirical poems (諷詩). He was arrested and sent to the Censorate prison (逮赴臺獄), with the intention of putting him to death. The Emperor alone took pity on him and assigned him to Huang-chou (黃州) as Assistant Commander of the Militia (團練副使) under supervision (安置). Shih built a residence on the Eastern Slope (東坡) and called himself the Recluse of the Eastern Slope (東坡居士). (Abbreviated - original text) Passing through Chin-ling (金陵) [Nanjing], he met Wang An-shih and said, "Major wars (大兵) and major legal cases (大獄) are signs of the decline of the Han and Tang dynasties. Now, in the west, troops have been employed for years (連年用兵), and in the southeast, a major legal case has arisen (致起大獄). Do you, Duke, have not a single word to offer remedy (公獨無一言以救乎)?" An-shih replied, "Both matters were initiated by [Ts'ai] Hui-ch'ing (惠卿). Since I am outside the government, how could I dare speak?" An-shih also said, "One must know that if obtaining the empire requires performing a single unrighteous act (行一不義) or killing one innocent person (殺一不辜), one should not do it (得天下弗爲). Only then is it acceptable." Shih joked, "Today's gentlemen (君子) compete to reduce their evaluation period (磨勘) by half a year; even if it means killing someone, they would do it." (Abbreviated - original text) He was appointed Hanlin Academician (翰林學士) for two years, concurrently serving as Reader-in-Waiting (侍讀). Once, while reading the Precious Instructions of the Ancestral Emperors (祖宗寶訓), he touched upon current affairs. Shih spoke extensively about the current lack of clarity in rewards and punishments (賞罰不明), leaving no encouragement for good or deterrence for evil (善惡無所勸沮). He also mentioned that the Yellow River (黃河) was naturally flowing north, but was being forced east; [?] invaded Chen-jung (鎭戎), killing and plundering tens of thousands; the commanding officials did not report it. If things continued like this in every matter, he feared it would gradually lead to decline and chaos (衰亂之漸). Shih stayed overnight in the palace forbidden quarters (鎭宿禁中) and was summoned for an audience in the side hall (召對便殿). Empress Dowager Hsüan-jen (宣仁后) said, "That your official position has reached this point so quickly was the late Emperor's intention. The late Emperor always sighed when reciting your writings, saying 'Remarkable talent, remarkable talent!' (奇才奇才) but he had not <84> yet had the chance to promote you." Shih could not help but weep uncontrollably (痛哭失聲). Empress Dowager Hsüan-jen and Emperor Che-tsung (哲宗) also wept, and everyone present was moved to tears (左右皆感涕). Afterwards, he was invited to sit, offered tea, and sent back to his office (院) with golden lotus candles (金蓮燭) from before the imperial presence. (Abbreviated - original text) While governing Hang-chou (知杭州), the area suffered a great drought, accompanied by famine and pestilence (饑疫幷作). Shih requested a reduction in the rice tribute supplied by the local circuit (減本路上供米), sold government grain (常平米) at reduced prices, and prepared large quantities of gruel (饘粥) and medicine (藥劑), saving numerous lives (活者甚衆). (Abbreviated - original text) When he governed Hang-chou a second time, he benefited the people so much (有德於民) that every household had his portrait (家有畫像), and they would offer prayers to it before eating (飮食必祝). They erected a shrine to him while he was still alive (作生祠云). Hang[-chou] was originally land near the sea, where the spring water was brackish and bitter (泉醎苦), and residents were few. The Tang prefect Li Pi (李泌) first drew water from the West Lake (西湖) to create six wells (六井). Po Chü-i (白居易) later dredged the West Lake, channeling its water into the Grand Canal (漕河) and irrigating a thousand *ch'ing* (頃) of fields. The people became prosperous (民以殷富). The lake became overgrown with water plants (葑). During the Song, dredging was neglected, and the accumulated plants formed land (葑積爲田), leaving little water. The canal lost its utility (漕河失利), and the six wells also nearly fell into disuse. Shih observed that the Mao-shan river exclusively received the tidal bore from the river (江潮), while the Yen-ch'iao river exclusively received water from the lake. He therefore dredged the two rivers to facilitate boat traffic (以通漕), rebuilt the weir (堰) to regulate water storage and release (蓄洩之限), and used the remaining resources to restore the six wells. He also took the dredged material (葑) and piled it in the lake, creating a long embankment (長堤) running thirty *li* north to south for pedestrians. When the embankment was completed, he planted hibiscus (芙蓉) and willow trees (楊柳) on it, making it picturesque like a painting (望之如畫圖). The people of Hang[-chou] named it Su Kung Ti (蘇公堤 - Duke Su's Embankment). The tide of the Ch'ien-t'ang River (淅江潮) came from the east at the mouth of the sea, its force like thunder (勢如雷霆). But Fu-shan mountain stood in the middle of the river, interlocking like dog's teeth (犬牙相錯) with the Yü-p'u mountains, creating eddies and strong currents (洄洑激射) that wrecked countless government and private boats each year (歲敗公私船. 不可勝計). Shih proposed dredging a canal (鑿漕河) upstream on the Pai River at a place called Shih-men (石門), turning north from Tz'u-p'u (慈浦) to reach Hsiao-ling (小嶺), and dredging an ancient river channel to avoid the dangers of Fu-shan (避浮山之險). He further stated that the waters of the three Wu regions (三吳) pooled into Lake T'ai (太湖), and the overflow from Lake T'ai formed the Sung River (松江) flowing into the sea. Since the Ch'ing-li era (慶曆), the Sung River had been obstructed by the construction of towpaths (築挽路扼塞), causing frequent flooding in the three Wu regions. He wanted to cut ten bridges (十橋) through the towpaths to speed up the river's flow (以迅江勢). Neither proposal was implemented, which people regretted (人以爲恨). Soon after, he became Minister of Personnel (吏部尙書), then Minister of War (兵部尙書), and later Minister of Rites (禮部尙書), concurrently holding the positions of Academician of the Tuan-ming Hall (端明殿), Hanlin Academician, and Reader-in-Waiting (翰林, 侍讀兩學士). When Emperor Che-tsung began his personal rule (親政), Shih requested an external appointment, becoming Governor of Ting-chou (知定州) while retaining his two academician titles. Military discipline in Ting-chou was lax (軍政壞弛). During the major spring military review (春大閱), Shih ordered the restoration of old protocols (擧舊典): the commander wore ordinary clothes (帥常服) and emerged from his tent, while officers and soldiers wore military attire (戎服執事) and performed their duties without daring to be lax (無敢怠慢者). The people of Ting[-chou] said they hadn't seen such propriety since Han Ch'i (言自韓琦後. 不見此禮至今矣). In the early Shao-sheng era (紹聖初) [1094 CE], he was demoted to govern Ying-chou (謫知英州). Before arriving, he was further demoted to Vice Commissioner of the Ning-yüan Army Commandery (貶寧遠軍節度副使) and banished to Hui-chou (惠州安置). After residing there for three years, he was further demoted to Assistant Prefect of Ch'iung-shan (貶瓊山別駕) and banished to Ch'ang-hua (居昌化). Ch'ang-hua was the ancient land of Tan-erh (儋耳), unfit for human habitation (非人所居). Medicine and food (藥餌) were unavailable. Initially, he rented official housing, but officials still deemed it inappropriate. Shih then bought land and built a house. The people of Tan[-erh] (儋人) helped him by transporting bricks and carrying earth in baskets (運甓畚土助之). He lived there alone with his youngest son Kuo (過), finding pleasure in writing books (著書爲樂). When Emperor Hui-tsung (徽宗) ascended the throne, he was transferred to Yung-chou (徙永州) and then pardoned (赦). He was reinstated to oversee the Yü-chü Taoist Temple (還提玉局觀) and restored to the rank of Gentleman for Court Service (復朝奉郞).
Since the Yüan-yu era (元祐), Shih had never requested promotion based on annual evaluations (未嘗以歲課乞遷), hence his official rank remained at this level. Not long after, he died in Ch'ang-chou (卒於常州) at the age of sixty-six [by East Asian reckoning; 65 by Western count].
Shih and his younger brother Ch'e (轍) both modeled their writing (文章) after their father. When young (弱冠), the father and sons went to the capital (京師), and overnight their fame became resounding (名聲赫然), stirring the four quarters. Shih once said of himself that his writing was like drifting clouds and flowing water (作文如行雲流水), initially without fixed form (初無定質), but always moving where it should move and stopping where it could not but stop (但常行於所當行. 止於所不可不止). Even Shih's words of jest, anger, or curse (笑怒罵之辭) could all be written down and recited. His style (其軆) was rich and radiant (渾涵光芒), looking down majestically upon a hundred generations (雄視百代). Since the beginning of literature, such writers have been rare indeed (蓋亦鮮矣). His father Hsün (洵) began writing a commentary on the Book of Changes (易傳) late in life but did not finish it, instructing Shih to carry on his work. Shih completed the *Commentary on the Changes* (易傳) and also wrote *Explanations of the Analects* (論語說). Later, while living in Hai-nan (海南), he wrote a *Commentary on the Book of Documents* (書傳). He also has collected works such as the *Tung-p'o Collection* (東坡等集), memorials (奏議), inner and outer edicts (內外制), and commentaries on T'ao Ch'ien's poetry (知陶詩). Contemporary literary figures like Huang T'ing-chien (黃庭堅), Ch'ao Pu-chih (晁補之), Ch'in Kuan (秦觀), Chang Lei (張來), and Ch'en Shih-tao (陳師道) were unrecognized by the world. Shih treated them as peers (朋儔), never regarding himself as their teacher or superior (未嘗以師賢自予也). From his time as an examination candidate (擧子) to his service in the imperial court (出入侍從), he always considered loving the ruler (愛君) fundamental. His upright integrity (挺挺大節) was constantly resented and hated by petty men (小人忌惡). Even after his death, his name was included in the list of the Yüan-yu partisan clique (元祐黨), and the publication of his collected works was banned (毁文集刊行者). When Emperor Kao-tsung (高宗) ascended the throne, he posthumously granted Shih the title of Academician of the Tzu-cheng Hall (贈資政殿學士) and appointed his grandson Fu <85> as Minister of Rites (禮部尙書). He also kept Shih's writings by his side (置左右), reading them without tiring (讀之. 忘倦), and personally composed a eulogy for the collection (親製集贊). (Abbreviated - original text) He was posthumously granted the title Grand Preceptor (贈太師) and the posthumous name Wen-chung (謚文忠 - Cultured and Loyal). His three sons, Mai (邁), Tai (迨), and Kuo (過), were all skilled writers (俱善爲文).

**Excerpt from Selections of Tungp'o's Writings (東坡의 文鈔引)**

When young, I regarded Su Tzu-chan (蘇子瞻) [Su Shih] in literature as Li Po (李白) in poetry and Han Hsin (韓信) in warfare: Heaven endowed each with the talent of an immortal (神仙), surpassing the world (軼世之才), not something attainable through worldly learning (非世之問學所及者). (Abbreviated - original text) In essence, regarding Chia I (賈誼) of Han and Lu Chih (陸贄) of Tang, one doesn't know what he was like [compared to them?]. Chu Hui-an (朱晦菴) [Zhu Xi] once criticized his writing for not shedding the style of the strategists (縱橫氣習). Perhaps this was only true in his youth when he was somewhat self-satisfied (沾沾自喜). After entering the court of Emperor Che-tsung, being summoned to the Two Drafting Offices (兩制), and later being banished to Hai-nan (海南), he almost became one who wandered aloof beyond the world (曠遠遊方之外者) like the ancients. However, that he incurred guilt due to his loyalty (以忠獲罪) and ultimately could not remain secure in the imperial court (卒不能安於朝廷之上) - was it the fault of his talent (豈其才之罪哉)? (Abbreviated - original text)

**Former Ode on the Red Cliff (前赤壁賦)**

In the autumn of the Imsul year (壬戌之秋) (Song dynasty, fifth year of Yüan-feng [元豊五年 - 1082 CE], Tungp'o aged forty-seven [坡年四十七]), the sixteenth day of the seventh month (七月旣望), Master Su (蘇子) and his guests (客) floated in a boat (泛舟) sightseeing below the Red Cliff (遊於赤壁之下). A clear breeze blew gently (淸風徐來); the water's waves did not rise (水波不興). Raising his wine cup to toast his guests (擧酒屬客), he recited the "Bright Moon" poem (誦明月之詩) and sang the "Modest Maiden" verses (歌窈窕之章). Shortly after (少焉), the moon rose from above the eastern mountain (月出於東山之上), hovering between the constellations Dipper and Ox (徘徊於斗牛之間). White mist lay across the river (白露橫江); the water's sheen merged with the sky (水光接天). Letting the single reed [boat] go where it pleased (縱一葦之所如), gliding over the vast expanse of ten thousand *ch'ing* (凌萬頃之茫然). Vast and boundless (浩浩乎), like riding the void, harnessing the wind (如憑虛御風), not knowing where to stop (而不知其所止). Light and airy (飄飄乎), like leaving the world to stand alone (如遺世獨立), sprouting wings to become an immortal (羽化而登仙). Thereupon (於是), drinking wine and feeling great joy (飮酒樂甚), he tapped the boat's side and sang (扣舷而歌之). The song went: "Cassia oars, orchid sweep (桂棹兮蘭檣)! Strike the bright void, surge against the flowing light (擊空明兮溯流光)! Vast, vast my longing (渺渺兮余懷)! I gaze toward my beauty at one end of the sky (望美人兮天一方)!" A guest played the vertical bamboo flute (洞簫), harmonizing with the song (倚歌和之). Its sound (其聲), mournful and long (鳴鳴然), seemed like resentment, like longing (如怨如慕), like weeping, like lamenting (如泣如訴). The lingering notes (餘音), fine and thread-like (糑糑), were unbroken like silk strands (不絶如縷). It made hidden dragons in dark valleys dance (舞幽*견之潛蛟) and widows on lonely boats weep (泣孤舟之婺婦) [*Note: 견 likely 虯, horned dragon; 婺 likely 嫠, widow]. Master Su grew solemn (愀然), straightened his robes (正襟), sat upright (危坐), and asked the guest, "Why is it like this (何爲其然也)?" The guest replied, "‘The moon is bright, the stars are few; crows and magpies fly south’ (月明星稀. 鳥鵲南飛). Isn't this the poem of Ts'ao Meng-te (曹孟德) [Cao Cao]? Looking west toward Hsia-k'ou (西望夏口), east toward Wu-ch'ang (東望武昌), mountains and rivers entwine (山川相繆), dark and densely green (鬱乎蒼蒼). Isn't this where Meng-te was trapped by young Chou (周郞) [Zhou Yu]? When he conquered Ching-chou (破荊州), descended upon Chiang-ling (下江陵), and sailed east with the current (順流而東也), his warships stretched for a thousand *li* (舳艫千里), his banners obscured the sky (旌旗蔽空). Pouring wine overlooking the river (釃酒臨江), holding his lance horizontally while composing poetry (橫槊賦詩), he was truly a hero of his age (固一世之雄也). But where is he now (而今安在哉)? Moreover, you and I fish and gather firewood on the river islets (漁樵於江渚之上), companioning fish and shrimp, befriending deer (侶魚鰕而友麋鹿). We sail a single-leaf skiff (駕一葉之扁舟), raise gourd cups to toast each other (擧匏樽以相屬). We are mayflies lodged between heaven and earth (寄蜉蝣於天地), tiny grains in the vast ocean (渺蒼海之一粟). We lament the brevity of our lives (哀吾生之須臾), envy the endlessness of the Long River (羡長江之無窮). We wish to roam with flying immortals (挾飛仙以遨遊), embrace the bright moon and live forever (抱明月而長終). Knowing this cannot be attained quickly (知不可乎驟得), we entrust these lingering sounds to the sorrowful wind (託遺響於悲風)." Master Su said, "Do you, guest, also know about the water and the moon (客亦知夫水與月乎)? What passes by is like this [water], yet it has never really gone (逝者如斯. 而未嘗往也). What waxes and wanes is like that [moon], yet ultimately it neither grows nor shrinks (盈虛者如彼. 而卒莫消長也). From the perspective of change (自其變者而觀之), heaven and earth cannot last for even a single instant (天地曾不能以一瞬). From the perspective of constancy (自其不變者而觀之), both things and I are inexhaustible (物與我皆無盡也). So why envy anything (而又何羡乎)? Furthermore, between heaven and earth, everything has its owner (物各有主). If it is not mine (苟非吾之所有), I cannot take even a single hair (雖一毫而莫取). Only the clear breeze on the river (惟江上之淸風) and the bright moon between the mountains (與山問之明月) – the ear receives one and it becomes sound (耳得之而爲聲), the eye encounters the other and it becomes color (目寓之而成色). Taking them is not forbidden (取之無禁); using them is inexhaustible (用之不竭). This is the inexhaustible treasury of the Creator (是造物者之無盡藏也), which you and I can enjoy together (而吾與子之所共樂)." The guest was pleased and smiled (客喜而笑). They washed the cups and poured again (洗盞更酌). The dishes and nuts were finished (肴核旣盡); cups and plates lay scattered about (盃盤狼藉). They pillowed their heads on each other in the boat (相與枕藉乎舟中), unaware that the east had already brightened (不知東方之旣白). (This ode was written when Tungp'o was banished to Huang-chou (此賦東坡謫黃州時作也)).

**Inscription for the Dream Study (夢齋銘)**

An essay of just over one hundred characters. Worldly life is a dream, an illusion (人世夢幻), the root of worldly people's afflictions (世人煩惱之根). Revealed in one phrase <86>:
The Dharma-body (法身) is omnipresent, everywhere is one. The illusory body (幻身) is unreal; wherever it goes is not real (所至非實). I observe the people of the world, born into unreality (生非實中), taking wakefulness as real (以寤爲正), taking stillness [sleep] as a dream (以寂爲夢). Clinging to what is encountered when suddenly asleep (忽寐所遇), grasping what is met when awake (執窹所遭). Accumulated grasping forms solidity, high as hills and mountains (積執成堅. 如丘山高). Attached to appearances, the Dharma-body is obscured (着見法身); both waking and sleeping are unreal (寤寐皆非). Knowing they are both unreal, waking and sleeping cause no hindrance (知其皆非. 寤寐無虧). Roaming the four directions (遨遊四方), the study [mind] does not move (齋則不遷). North, south, east, west – the Dharma-body is inherently so (法身本然).
The perfected person has no dreams (至人無夢). Some say Emperor Kao-tsung (高宗), King Wu (武王), Confucius (孔子) all dreamed. Buddha (佛) also dreamed. Dream is not different from waking (夢不異覺); waking is not different from dream (覺不異夢). Dream is precisely waking (夢卽是覺); waking is precisely dream (覺卽是夢). Is this perhaps why it is said they have no dreams (此其所以爲無夢也歟)?

**On Farming (稼說)**

Have you ever observed the farming of the rich (富人之稼乎)? Their fields are fertile (其田美), and their food is sufficient and more (其食足而有餘). Because their fields are fertile and extensive, they can be left fallow in rotation (可以更休), allowing the soil's strength to recover (地力得完). Because their food is sufficient and more, planting is never late (種之常不後時), and harvesting always happens when ripe (歛之常及其熟). Therefore, the crops of the rich are always excellent (富人之稼常美), with few empty husks and many full grains (少秕而多實), storable for long periods without rotting (久藏而不腐). Now, my family of ten mouths (吾十口之家) shares one hundred *mu* of land (共百畝之田). We exploit every inch (寸寸而取之), watching it day and night (日夜而望之). Hoeing, plowing, reaping, and weeding follow one another upon it like fish scales (鋤耰銍艾相尋於其上者. 如魚鱗), exhausting the soil's strength (地力竭矣). Planting is often untimely (稼之常不及時), and harvesting often cannot wait for ripeness (歛之常不待其熟). How can this possibly result in fine crops again (此豈能復有美稼哉)? The talented people of ancient times (古之人. 其才) were not vastly superior to people today (非有以大過今之人也). It was how, in their ordinary lives (其平居), they cultivated themselves (所以自養) and dared not use their talents lightly (不敢輕用), waiting for maturity (以待其成者), anxiously like an infant hoping to grow (閔閔焉如嬰兒之望長也). The weak were nurtured until strong (弱者養之至於剛); the empty were nurtured until fulfilled (虛者養之以至於克). They entered service only after thirty (三十而後仕), received rank only after fifty (五十而後爵), trusted after long periods of obscurity (信於久屈之中), and employed after reaching full potential (用於至足之後). They flowed forth like the overflow of abundance (流於旣溢之餘) and acted at the peak of their accumulated strength (發於持滿之末). This is why the ancients greatly surpassed others (此古之人所以大過人), and why gentlemen today fall short (而今之君子. 所以不及也). When I was young (吾少也), I aspired to learning (有志於學). Unfortunately, I passed the examinations with you, my friend, early (不幸而早得與吾子同年). Your success also cannot be said to be not early (吾子之得. 亦不可謂不早也). Though I now wish to consider myself inadequate (自以爲不足), the crowd already pushes me forward recklessly (衆且妄推之矣). Alas, my friend (嗚呼吾子)! Will you leave this situation and devote yourself to learning (其去此而務學也哉)? Observe broadly and select concisely (博觀而約取); accumulate thickly and express sparingly (厚積而薄發). My advice to you stops here (吾告子止於此矣). When you return (子歸), pass through the capital and inquire (過京師而問焉). There is one called Ch'e Tzu-yu (轍子由); he is my younger brother (吾弟). Tell him this as well (其亦以是語之).

**To Tzu-yu (與子由) (Letter - 簡書)**

... Guests, knowing my decline and laziness (衰懶), understand I cannot influence matters for others (不能與人爲輕重), so visits gradually decrease (見顧漸少), which is truly fortunate (殊可自幸). Recently, regarding the matter involving Governor Liu (柳太守一事), my reputation (軆面) suffered greatly, and discussions were unavoidable (極生不免有議論). My brother, your major principles (大節) surpass others, but you are careless in small matters (小事不輕意). It's just like writing poetry: at its heights, it can rival the ancients (高處. 可以追配古人), but when inspiration fails (失意), it might invite scorn even from clumsy eyes and vulgar tastes (或受唾於拙目薄俗). One must carefully examine people's minor flaws (正好點檢人小疵); you cannot afford not to pay attention (不可不留意也). We brothers are both old now (吾兄弟. 俱老矣). We should amuse ourselves as time allows (當以時自娛); beyond this, myriad matters are not worth troubling the mind (此外萬端. 皆不足介懷). What is meant by amusing oneself (所謂自娛者) is not the pleasures of the world (非世俗之樂者). Simply having nothing within the chest [*heart/mind*] (但*中廓無一物), then everything within heaven and earth – mountains, rivers, plants, trees, insects, fish (卽天壞之內山川草木虫魚之類) – all become means for my enjoyment (皆吾作樂事也).

**Summary**

The article by Yi Chongnin uses the arrival of the Imsul year (1922) and its 7th month to reflect on Korean cultural identity. Referencing Su Dongpo's famous "Former Ode on the Red Cliff," also written in an Imsul year's 7th month (1082 CE), the author laments that contemporary Koreans are either fixated on the West ("Paeuhyŏl") or nostalgically attached to China ("Mohwahyŏl"), both neglecting Korean history associated with the Imsul year (like events in Koryŏ or the recent death of Son Pyŏnghŭi). He then introduces Su Dongpo extensively through biography, literary excerpts (including the Red Cliff ode), and anecdotes, implicitly suggesting a model of cultural engagement. Finally, he connects the date to the 2nd anniversary of the *Kaebyŏk* magazine. From a historical perspective, the article vividly illustrates the intellectual anxieties of colonial Korea, caught between decaying Sinocentrism and encroaching Western influence, highlighting a nationalist call for greater self-awareness and knowledge of Korean history, even while using a Chinese literary figure as a central motif. The critique of both "Paeuhyŏl" and "Mohwahyŏl" is particularly revealing of the complex cultural positioning during this period.

壬戌之秋 七月
						李鍾麟
今年이 마츰 壬戌年이자 今月이 또한 7月이올시다. 그래서 「壬戌之秋七月 蘇子與客泛舟遊於赤壁之下」라는 것이 聯想됩니다. 그러나 壬戌年 이해가 우리 東洋사람에게는 가장 조치 못한 해운이올시다. 中國 大聖인 孔子가 이해 4月에 돌아가섯습니다. 宗敎 政治 革命 모든 方面으로 朝鮮 4,000年 歷史上 가장 掉尾의 壯을 가진 孫義菴先生이 이해 5月에 돌아가섯습니다. 壬戌年이라는 해가 우리에게 얼마마한 悲哀와 恐怖를 준 해운이온이까. 이제 우리들 中 僅히 20世紀니 新風潮니 하는 等의 標語을 말하는 이들 即 拜歐熱이 方盛한 네들은 今年이 西曆 1222年인 줄은 알아도 우리 朝鮮檀紀 後 第 72朞의 壬戌年인 줄은 아시는 이가 稀少한가 보외다. 이와 反對로 腦숙에 아즉도 慕華熱이 적지 아니한 어른들은 우리 高句麗 蓋蘇文이 唐將 龐孝泰의 百萬大兵을 蛇水上에서 大破하던 壬戌年 高麗 文宗 36年 日本에서 우리에게 遣使來貢하던 壬戌年인 줄은 아는 이가 殆無하고 이 해 이 달은 宋나라 蘇東坡가 赤壁江에서 배 띄우고 놀던 그 해 그 달로만 아는 이가 만습니다. 今日로 보면 拜歐하는 이가 慕華하는 이보다 差勝하다 할지나 제집 譜學은 모로고 남의 집 譜學을 잘한다는 點에서는 兩方이 一般이 아니온이까. 그러나 하도 모르는 것이 만흔 우리들 모를 뿐만 아니라 알랴고도 아니하는 우리들로서는 남에게나마 全然히 모르는 것보다는 낫지 안습니까.
今年 今月 即 壬戌之秋 7月이 蘇東坡의 年月로만 아는 것도 무던함이다마는 旣是 알려하면 一步를 더 나가서 蘇東坡는 如何한 人物이라던가 그 壬戌年이 이 壬戌年까지 몃 해라던가 아울너 그 해 우리 朝鮮에는 무슨 일이 잇섯던 것이라던가를 자세히 아는 것이 조치 안습이까.＜83＞
東坡의 壬戌年은 距今 823年 前 即 宋 英宗 5年 高句麗 36年 그 해가 곳 日本에서 遣使來貢하던 壬戌年이외다. 筆者도 일즉이 慕華班 最末席의 一人이엇습니다. 그래서 東坡의 本傳大略과 밋 우리에게 800年間 印像을 주던 「壬戌之秋七月」 前赤壁賦를 그대로 紹介하야 讀者 大家의 一笑를 買코저 하오며 딸아서 압흐로 壬戌之秋 7月 1日은 朝鮮 開闢雜誌 創刊 第2周年 紀念日이엇던 것을 잇지 마시고 永遠히 紀念하야 주섯스면 하는 希望이 懇切합니다.

前赤壁賦
壬戌之秋(宋元豊五年坡年四十七)七月旣望. 蘇子與客. 泛舟遊於赤壁之下. 淸風徐來. 水波不興. 擧酒屬客. 誦明月之詩. 歌窈窕之章. 少焉. 月出於東山之上徘徊於斗牛之間. 白露橫江. 水光接天. 縱一葦之所如凌萬頃之茫然. 浩浩乎如憑虛御風. 而不知其所止. 飄飄乎如遺世獨立. 羽化而登仙. 於是. 飮酒樂甚. 扣舷而歌之. 歌曰桂棹兮蘭檣 擊空明兮溯流光. 渺渺兮余懷望美人兮天一方. 客有吹洞簫者. 倚歌和之. 其聲. 鳴鳴然. 如怨如慕. 如泣如訴 餘音糑糑. 不絶如縷. 舞幽*견之潛蛟. 泣孤舟之婺婦. 蘇子愀然正襟. 危坐而問客曰. 何爲其然也. 客曰. 月明星稀. 鳥鵲南飛. 此非曹孟德之詩乎. 西望夏口. 東望武昌. 山川相繆. 鬱乎蒼蒼. 此非孟德之困於周郞者乎. 方其破荊州. 下江陵順流而東也. 舳艫千里. 旌旗蔽空. 釃酒臨江. 橫槊賦詩. 固一世之雄也. 而今安在哉. 况吾與子. 漁樵於江渚之上. 侶魚鰕而友麋鹿. 駕一葉之扁舟. 擧匏樽以相屬. 寄蜉蝣於天地. 渺蒼海之一粟. 哀吾生之須臾羡長江之無窮. 挾飛仙以遨遊. 抱明月而長終. 知不可乎驟得. 託遺響於悲風. 蘇子曰. 客亦知夫水與月乎. 逝者如斯. 而未嘗往也. 盈虛者如彼. 而卒莫消長也. 盖將自其變者. 而觀之則. 天地. 曾不能以一瞬. 自其不變者. 而觀之則. 物與我. 皆無盡也. 而又何羡乎. 且夫天地之間. 物各有主. 苟非吾之所有. 雖一毫而莫取. 惟江上之淸風. 與山問之明月. 耳得之而爲聲. 目寓之而成色取之無禁. 用之不竭. 是造物者之無盡藏也. 而吾與子之所共樂. 客. 喜而笑. 洗盞更酌. 肴核旣盡. 盃盤狼藉. 相與枕藉乎舟中. 不知東方之旣白. (此賦東坡謫黃州時作也)

夢齋銘
一篇一百有餘字. 人世夢幻. 世人煩惱之根. 一言＜86＞ 道破
法身充滿. 處處皆一. 幻身虛妄. 所至非實. 我觀世人. 生非實中. 以寤爲正. 以寂爲夢. 忽寐所遇. 執窹所遭. 積執成堅. 如丘山高. 着見法身. 寤寐皆非. 知其皆非. 寤寐無虧. 遨遊四方. 齋則不遷. 南北東西. 法身本然.
至人無夢. 或曰高宗. 武王. 孔子. 皆夢佛亦夢. 夢不異覺. 覺不異夢. 夢卽是覺. 覺卽是夢. 此其所以爲無夢也歟.

稼說
曷嘗觀於富人之稼乎. 其田美而其食足而有餘其田美而多則. 可以更休而地力得完. 其食足而有餘則種之常不後時而. 歛之常及其熟故. 富人之稼常美少秕而多實. 久藏而不腐. 今吾十口之家. 而共百畝之田. 寸寸而取之. 日夜而望之. 鋤耰銍艾相尋於其上者. 如魚鱗而地力竭矣. 稼之常不及時而歛之常不待其熟. 此豈能復有美稼哉. 古之人. 其才. 非有以大過今之人也. 其平居. 所以自養而不敢輕用. 以待其成者. 閔閔焉如嬰兒之望長也. 弱者養之至於剛. 虛者養之以至於克. 三十而後仕. 五十而後爵. 信於久屈之中而用於至足之後. 流於旣溢之餘而發於持滿之末. 此古之人所以大過人而今之君子. 所以不及也. 吾少也. 有志於學. 不幸而早得與吾子同年. 吾子之得. 亦不可謂不早也. 吾今雖欲自以爲不足. 而衆且妄推之矣. 嗚呼吾子. 其去此而務學也哉. 博觀而約取. 厚積而薄發. 吾告子止於此矣. 子歸. 過京師而問焉. 有曰轍子由者. 吾弟. 其亦以是語之.

與子由(簡書)
云云. 賓客知其衰懶. 不能與人爲輕重. 見顧漸少殊可自幸. 近者. 擧柳太守一事. 軆面. 極生不免有議論. 吾第大節. 過人. 而小事不輕意. 正如作詩高處. 可以追配古人. 而失意. 或受唾於拙目薄俗. 正好點檢人小疵. 不可不留意也. 吾兄弟. 俱老矣. 當以時自娛此外萬端. 皆不足介懷所謂自娛者. 非世俗之樂者. 但*中廓無一物. 卽天壞之內山川草木虫魚之類. 皆吾作樂事也.
