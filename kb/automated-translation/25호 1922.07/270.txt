江村
						金素月

날 저믈고, 돗는 달에
흰물은 솰솰,
金모래 반짝.
靑노새 몰고가는 郎君!
여긔는 江村,
나는 홀어미로세.

그러면은, 나는
느즌봄, 오늘이 다 가도록
百年妻眷을 울고가네.
나는 萬年窮째나는 선배,
당신은 江村에 홀어미몸. ＜150＞

River Village
						Kim So-wŏl

Day darkens, and in the rising moon,
White water murmurs, swish swish,
Gold (金) sand sparkles.
Young master (郎君) riding a green mule (靑노새)!
Here is River Village (江村),
I am a widow.

Therefore, I,
This late spring day, until it’s all gone,
Weep for my lifelong companion (百年妻眷).
I am the elder fated to eternal poverty (萬年窮째나는 선배),
You are the widow’s body in River Village (江村). <150>

**Summary**

The poem "River Village" by Kim So-wŏl depicts a melancholic scene at dusk in a riverside village. The speaker, a widow, observes a young man passing by and reflects on her own loneliness and sorrow, contrasting her status as a poor, grieving widow with the passing figure. The poem evokes a sense of quiet despair and the passage of time in a rural setting. From a historical perspective, the poem offers a glimpse into the emotional landscape of individuals, particularly women experiencing loss and hardship, in rural Korea during the colonial period. The mention of widowhood and perceived eternal poverty provides insight into social conditions and personal grief from that era, potentially reflecting broader societal constraints or sentiments.
