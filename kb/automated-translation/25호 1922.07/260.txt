孤寂한날
						金素月

당신님의 便紙를
바든 그날로
서러운風說이 돌앗습니다.＜149＞

물에 던저달나고 하신 그뜻은
언제나 꿈꾸며 생각하라는
그말슴인줄 압니다.

흘려 쓰신 글씨나마
諺文글자로
눈물이라고 적어보내섯지요.

물에 던저달나고하신 그뜻은
뜨거운 눈물 방울방울 흘리며,
맘곱게 읽어달나는 말슴이지오.＜150＞
＜149-150＞

A Lonely Day
						Kim So-wŏl

The day I received
your letter (便紙)
Sorrowful rumors (風說) began to circulate.<149>

That request to throw it in the water,
I know it means
To always dream and think of you.

Even in hastily written script,
In Hangul letters (諺文글자),
You sent the word "tears," didn't you?

That request to throw it in the water,
It means, while shedding hot tears drop by drop,
To read it with a gentle heart, doesn't it?<150>
<149-150>

**Summary**

The poem expresses the speaker's feelings upon receiving a letter from a loved one ("당신님") on a lonely day. Sorrowful rumors circulate concurrently, adding to the somber mood. The sender asks the speaker to throw the letter in the water, but the speaker interprets this not literally, but as an instruction to cherish the letter, reread it often with tears, and constantly remember the sender. The poem highlights themes of hidden meanings, sorrow, and intimate communication through the written word. From a historical perspective, the poem is interesting as an example of lyrical expression in vernacular Korean (Hangul, referred to as 諺文) published during the Japanese colonial period. Its focus on personal emotion and the use of the Korean script in literary form could be seen by historians as a subtle assertion of cultural identity and personal feeling within the constraints of the era.
