Swallow
						Kim So-wŏl

Today at first light, at dawn break,
To the warm land of Gangnam (江南),
The swallow departed, crying and weeping.

As if bidding farewell,
When the gently blowing dawn
Wind blew, it departed.

Parting from whom,
It is the swallow that used to gaze at
The sky of its departed hometown (故鄕).

Because it is a body wandering by the roadside,
Even as the gently blowing dawn
Wind blows, it departed.<148>

**Summary**

This poem by Kim So-wŏl depicts a swallow's sorrowful departure from its hometown towards the warmer land of Gangnam at dawn. The gentle dawn wind contrasts with the swallow's weeping, emphasizing the pain of leaving. The poem evokes themes of separation, longing for a lost home, and the state of being a wanderer. From a historical perspective, the poem, written during the Japanese colonial period (1910-1945), could be interpreted as an allegory for the displacement and sorrow experienced by Koreans forced to leave their homeland or lamenting their lost sovereignty. The imagery of a weeping swallow leaving its 'hometown (故鄕)' might resonate with historians studying the emotional landscape and nationalist sentiments of Koreans during that era.

제비
						金素月
오늘아츰 먼동 틀때
江南의더운나라로
제비가 울고불며 떠낫습니다.

잘 가라는듯시
살살 부는 새벽의
바람이 불때에떠낫습니다.

어이를 離別하고
떠난 故鄕의
하늘을 바라보든 제비이지오.

길가에서 떠도는 몸이길내,
살살 부는 새벽의
바람이 부는데도 떠낫습니다.＜148＞
