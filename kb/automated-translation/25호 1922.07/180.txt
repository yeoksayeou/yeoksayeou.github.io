Section 4: The Lelang Period (樂浪期)

1. Historical Overview
The Lelang period refers to the era when a part of the territory of the Rose of Sharon (Korea), albeit temporarily, came under foreign interference and received the influence of its distinct culture. Whether it holds significant value worth discussing is a separate issue for the moment, but one must transcend national boundaries and ethnic distinctions to observe it with a broad, impartial artistic eye. It cannot be overlooked simply because it is minor or immature, especially considering that, even if only a faint echo, it stimulated the innate artistic temperament of the Paedal (Korean) people, helping to foster the driving force that led to the splendid blossoming and glorious fruition of later art. Even Confucius, said to have been born wise, asked about music from Ch'ang Hong (萇弘), about rites from Lao Tan (老聃), about official titles from T'an-tzu (郯子), and learned the zither from Master Hsiang (師襄); thus were his immortal qualities as a sage of myriad ages spurred. Our art of the Lelang period can be likened to an artist skilled in painting (丹靑), who, filled with the joy and agony of wanting to express the beauty they feel, finds a momentary external formal convenience that compels the people to finally express beauty. The colors revealed on the canvas are, of course, produced by the strength of the artist's hand and arm, and are formed as the crystallization of the artist's emotion and sincerity. How could one judge the quality of the calligraphy or painting based solely on the origin of its form?
Although not unaffected by its influence, since the subject is 'us' and the object is 'them,' there should be no hesitation retained within it.
Tracing back momentarily to investigate this, the *Shiji* (史記) states:
Kija (箕子), whose original surname was Tzu (子) and given name Hsü-yü (須臾), led five thousand Chinese people to escape troubles to Chosŏn. The *Book of Odes*, *Book of Documents*, rites, music, medicine, shamanism, yin-yang, divination, and the like, along with artisans of all crafts, followed him. As their languages were mutually unintelligible,<120> they communicated through interpreters. He eventually established his capital at P'yŏngyang, taught the people rites, righteousness, sericulture, and weaving, established eight prohibitions, and there was no selling in marriage. Consequently, the people did not steal from each other, doors were left unlocked, women were chaste and faithful, food was eaten with ritual vessels (籩豆), and there was a spirit of benevolence and virtue.
While there are various disputes regarding the fact of Kija's southward migration, even if his homeland was near Liaodong (遼東), his influence must have spread somehow. Furthermore, it is said that the 8th King, Chinpyŏng Wang Ch'ak (眞平王 捉), minted 'mother-son' coins, and the 38th King, Hyŏnmun Wang Sŏk (顯文王 釋), performed rites at the Shrine of Tan'gun (檀君廟), suggesting a connection was not absent. It can also be known that practices like casting (鑄造) began from this time.
Later, during the time of the 41st King, Ae Wang Chun (哀王 準), he trusted and favored Wei Man (衛滿), a refugee from the state of Yan (燕國), placing him in charge of border defense. However, he was conversely conquered by him. Thereupon, Wei Man, having gained military power and wealth, called his state Chosŏn. His grandson, Ugo (右渠), indulged in arrogance and cruelty until he was destroyed by Emperor Wu of the Former Han (前漢 武帝). The *Hanshu* (漢書) states:
In the summer of the third year of Emperor Wu of Han's Yuanfeng era (元封三年), he surrendered, and his land was made into Lelang (樂浪), Lintun (臨屯), Xuantu (玄菟), and Zhenfan (眞番).

The Four Commanderies (4郡)
The Four Commanderies thus came into being here; the 3rd year of Yuanfeng corresponds to 110 BCE. 27 years later, in the 5th year of Emperor Zhao's Shiyuan era (昭帝始元五年, 82 BCE), consolidation was carried out, establishing the two commanderies of Lelang and Xuantu. After another 280-odd years, during the Jian'an era (建安 年中) of Emperor Xian at the end of the Han dynasty (漢末獻帝), Gongsun Du (公孫度), the governor of Liaodong, had his son Gongsun Kang (公孫康) establish the Daifang Commandery (帶方郡) in the southern wilderness of Lelang Commandery. Thus, there were again three commanderies. The *Sanguozhi* (三國誌) states:
At the end of the reigns of Emperors Huan and Ling (桓靈之末), the Han (韓) and Ye (濊) grew strong, and the commanderies and counties could not control them. Many people flowed into Han territories (韓國). During the Jian'an era, Gongsun Kang divided the southern wilderness of Tún yǒu County (屯有縣) to establish Daifang Commandery, sending Gongsun Mo (公孫模), Zhang Chang (張敞), and others to gather the remaining populace.
The "end of the reigns of Emperors Huan and Ling" refers to the end of the reigns of Emperor Huan (桓帝) and Emperor Ling (靈帝) of Han, which is the early period of Emperor Xian (獻帝) of the Later Han. Although outwardly appearing to be under Han Chinese interference, one can infer that the hearts of the people were also inclined towards the Han and Ye tribes. Viewed from this perspective, it seems that at the time, only administrators came over, each seeking to expand their authority. Apart from that, special immigration projects like those of today seem to have been rare, with only occasional naturalized citizens (歸化). This seems natural; since it wasn't their original intention, how could it last long or be stable?
To the north, Koguryŏ (高句麗) grew particularly strong and invaded, while opposing it to the south, Paekche (百濟) gained momentum and pressed forward. Since the Wei (魏) and Jin (晋) periods,<121> Lelang and Daifang were increasingly encroached upon. Chang T'ung (張統) tried to establish himself between the two states, but due to continuous conflict year after year, he could not maintain his position for long.
Chang T'ung of Liaodong occupied the two commanderies of Lelang and Daifang and fought with King Ŭl Pulli (乙弗利) of Koguryŏ. In the first year of Emperor Min of Jin's Jianxing era (晋愍帝建興元年), Lelang was annexed by Koguryŏ.
Ultimately, in the first year of Jianxing (313 CE), Lelang was seized by Koguryŏ. Barely retreating south to defend Daifang, it too was annexed by Paekche the following year (314 CE).
In the second year of Western Jin's Jianxing era (西晋建興二年), Koguryŏ invaded south. Daifang, occupied by Chang T'ung, was subsequently annexed by Paekche.
From the establishment of the Four Commanderies by Emperor Wu of Han until Chang T'ung abandoned the commandery and returned north, 420 years passed.
Thus, the Paedal people, who had held sway in Liaodong, completely shed even the superficial shackles, and their elegant form began to shine forth.
This event truly marks the reason for the dawning of the flourishing era in the art history of the peninsular people.

2. Construction (築造)
What needs to be studied from the Lelang period naturally pertains to the Four Commanderies. Among the Four Commanderies, the most prosperous was Lelang Commandery. By investigating Lelang, inferring about the other three commanderies should not be too difficult. Therefore, I intend to discuss here Lelang, which was the center of contemporary culture and still forms the cultural heartland of Chosŏn today.
The administrative center of Lelang was Wanggŏm (王險, P'yŏngyang). Numerous ancient roof tiles (古瓦) from that era have been discovered near the Taedong River outside P'yŏngyang Castle, and the distinct remains of the castle site are located across the river. Specifically, about 1 *ri* (里, approx. 0.4 km) south of P'yŏngyang, below the Taedong River Railway Bridge on the left bank of the Taedong River (Taedong-gun, Taedonggang-myŏn), there is an earthen fortress (土城) covering an area of about 45 *chō* (丁, approx. 44.6 hectares). From this site, numerous ancient tile fragments and other relics from the Lelang period have been discovered. Among these, ancient tiles clearly inscribed with the characters "Lelang Commandery" (樂浪郡) confirm that this site was the administrative center of Lelang Commandery.
Centering on the earthen fortress, earthen ramparts resembling small hills surround its front, east, south, and west. Scattered nearby, within about 1 *ri*, are over 1,000 earthen tombs (土墳).
In Europe (歐洲), these are called "Mounds." France (佛蘭西) has the most, followed by Denmark (丁抹), Prussia (普魯西), etc. They are scattered from the southern coast of Sweden (瑞典) <122> to England (英吉利), Spain (西班牙), Portugal (葡萄牙), and are especially numerous in North and Central Africa (亞弗利加).
Northern Africa, of course, is the homeland of Egypt (埃及), a civilized nation from 5,000 years ago. At that time, scholarship and arts had already developed; the people who built the enormous pyramids, obelisks, and sphinxes truly lived there. The origin of mounds likely began there even earlier, extending north to various European countries and east through Italy (伊太利) and Greece (希臘) to India (印度), marking the beginning of its transmission to Asia (亞細亞). After reaching a stage in India, it passed through Central Asia to Siberia (西伯利亞). Although the exact timelines may not match, the structure and form are generally similar.
Furthermore, this practice spread south to Han China (漢) and soon reached Lelang. That is, the ancient tombs of Lelang also follow this lineage. The fact that the structure and form of Lelang's ancient tombs are similar and indistinguishable from those of the Han Dynasty confirms this reality.
The external shape is square in plan, tapering upwards, but forming a square flat top at the summit. Most have largely collapsed, taking the shape of rounded earthen mounds.
The interior consists of a chamber for placing the coffin, called the *hyŏnsil* (玄室) or *hyŏn'gung* (玄宮), or sometimes *kwak* (槨). There are two types of chambers: wooden chambers (木槨) and brick chambers (塼槨).
Wooden Chamber (木槨): The walls of the burial chamber are constructed with timber. Even the ceiling is covered horizontally with large logs, and the floor is also laid with good quality wood. Usually, two wooden coffins are placed inside the chamber, suggesting that joint burial of husband and wife was the common practice at the time. Numerous burial goods, such as vessels (皿器), are placed around them. The method of burying and preserving these wooden chambers was also carefully considered. While some had no special processing for preservation, others had the exterior of the chamber surrounded by bricks (塼), with the outer surface further protected by clay to prevent direct contact with the soil. Sometimes, charcoal was piled around the chamber, and gravel was laid on the outside to ensure long-term preservation. How could this not be considered remarkable?
Brick Chamber (塼槨): As the name implies, the chamber is built with bricks (煉瓦). The bricks used differ slightly in shape from modern bricks: one end has a central concave part, and the other has a central convex part. When laid, the concave and convex parts fit together, making them arguably more ideal than modern ones. Furthermore, the bricklaying method involves alternating rows vertically and horizontally, and the various patterns carved onto the surfaces differ with each row. Truly,<123> the manufacturing method is superior by several levels; one can only be endlessly amazed.
Chamber construction methods include single chambers or those connecting two or three chambers. The walls are built bulging slightly outward on all four sides to prevent pressure from the surrounding earth. The brick stacking method is also skillful, meaning bricks are laid sequentially in rows, vertically and horizontally, according to their patterns. Following the custom of the period, it is common to place the coffins of both husband and wife side by side.
Some ceilings are covered by placing large logs side by side on top, with earth piled over them to form a rounded mound. Others show extraordinary skill with different structures: the upper corners of the walls are built using corbelling (迫持法) to form a dome-shaped ceiling (穹窿形). When connecting two chambers, two dome ceilings are created, and the passage between them forms an arch (아치, Arch) at the top. In terms of date, even considering the late Later Han period, it is estimated to be around 1,700 years ago. Alas! In our Rose of Sharon Peninsula, the land of art, already in the 2nd century CE, exquisitely and ideally crafted bricks were manufactured to build dome ceilings and construct arches like this.
Among the tombs in England (英國), some are divided into three chambers with curved walls, but they are not comparable to ours, let alone built with such ideal bricks. They are not in the same league.
However, what about Japan? The construction of arches and dome ceilings belongs only to the period since the Meiji Restoration (維新以來), and even then, it was merely imitation of Western styles. Our ancestors, who 1,700 years ago pioneered such marvelous architectural techniques as corbelling as a common practice and applied them skillfully, looking back is simply overwhelming. Yet, on the other hand, its source still flows inexhaustibly, circulating fervently within our hearts, seeking rebirth. Oh, the depth of decline! It is only strange that we have maintained a foolish remnant existence, unaware of the reasons why.
About 1.5 *ri* west of Yonggang town (龍岡邑) lies the Ŏŭl-tong Old Fortress (於乙洞 古城). An earthen fortress of about 3 *chō* (approx. 3 hectares) is surrounded by walls; the east-west walls are 500 *ch'ŏk* (尺, approx. 150m) long, and the north-south walls are over 400 *ch'ŏk* (approx. 120m) long. Ancient tiles found nearby possess the characteristics of the Lelang period. This is another example of Lelang period fortress construction. Furthermore, the discovery of an ancient stele confirmed it as the site of Yŏmch'ŏm County (黏蟬縣), one of the counties of Lelang Commandery.
Besides this, in Haeun-myŏn (海雲面) and Yongwŏl-myŏn (龍月面), there are large clusters of ancient tombs (古墳羣), also of two types, wooden and brick chambers, but their form is identical to those near the Lelang Commandery administrative center, so there is no need for further discussion.<124>
About 1.5 *ri* south of Pongsan (鳳山) and Sariwŏn (沙里院), there is a fortress site surrounded by earthen walls of about 4-5 *chō* (approx. 4-5 hectares), known as "Tangt'osŏng" (唐土城) or "Kotangsŏng" (古唐城). Within it is a small village called "T'osŏngnae" (土城內). Here too, numerous ancient tiles from the Lelang Commandery period have been found. Based on the nearby ancient tombs, it might be identified as the administrative center of Daifang Commandery. Perhaps, facing pressure from Paekche invasion towards the end of the period, the commandery administration gradually retreated north and established its center here.
Following the railway line down from Sariwŏn Station (沙里院驛), one soon discovers a large earthen tomb called "Toch'ong" (都塚) in Chogang-tong, Misan-myŏn, Pongsan-gun. Two burial chambers (*hyŏnsil*) are constructed using bricks of the same form as those from the ancient tombs near the Lelang Commandery center. Various characters are carved on the brick faces, among which one reads, "Brick of Governor Chang Pu-i (張撫夷), Grand Administrator of Daifang" (使君帶方太守張撫夷塼). Based on this inscription, it can be known that this is the tomb of a Grand Administrator of Daifang named Chang (張某). *Pu-i* (撫夷) seems to be an official title. There is also a brick inscribed "Chang Pu-i of Yuyang" (漁陽張撫夷塼), suggesting Chang Pu-i was from Yuyang (漁陽, present-day Suzhou [蘇州] near Beijing [北京], China). Bricks with text lamenting the death of the same Grand Administrator also exist, but not a single burial item was found, likely due to looting by disorderly people. Besides this, clusters of over 20 ancient tombs each are found in the area north of the earthen fortress and on a hill about 1 *ri* south, near Ŭnp'a (銀波), all exhibiting the characteristics of the Lelang period.
Generally, Daifang Commandery was first established by Gongsun Kang towards the end of the Later Han period, so its duration was relatively short, making such remains difficult to find.

3. Relics (遺物)
Here, "relics" is a general term for artifacts related to casting, carving, crafts, painting, etc. However, let's start with tiles (瓦), which constitute the largest number.
Tiles (瓦): The characteristic feature of these tiles is a slightly protruding center resembling a wart (疣瘤), surrounded by a rather wide line. Additionally, two lines forming a cross shape divide the tile face into four sections, within which spiral patterns (渦水紋) are found. Tiles of this form are generally discovered near Chang'an (長安) of Han China. This style spread from the Qin (秦國) period through the Former and Later Han dynasties to Lelang. Flat tiles (平瓦) have a unique pattern on both front and back surfaces, with raised lines running horizontally on the front and vertically on the back. They are quite thin, which is also a characteristic of the Lelang period.<125>
Coffins (棺): There are camphor wood coffins (樟棺) whose fragrance still lingers, which can be called truly elegant. Lacquer is applied to both the inside and outside of the coffins. Some are black on both sides, but most have yellow lacquer inside and black lacquer outside. Such items truly manifest both profound emotion and refined taste.
Carved Items (彫刻品): Most are found inside wooden chambers (*mokkwak*). Discussing those found within the coffin, placed near the deceased's body:
(琀, *Ham*): Jade shaped like a cicada, placed in the mouth of the deceased for burial.
(鼻塞, *Pisae*): Small jade plugs inserted into the nostrils.
(充耳, *Ch'ung'i*): Small jade plugs used to block the ear canals.
(帶鉤, *Taegu*): Belt hooks made of pure gold, glittering brightly. Large and small dragon shapes are rendered in low relief carving (薄浮刻). Their exquisiteness and delicate elegance are unsurpassed.
(劒, *Kŏm*): Swords show no particular difference from those used in daily life, but are heavily adorned with jewels and jade.
(石豚, *Sŏkton*): Small jade pigs. In ancient Chinese tombs, it is common to find two placed under the armpits, but only one was found here.
(璧, *Pyŏk*): A flat, round disc placed under the back. Traditionally, its shape is described as "outer circle symbolizing Heaven, inner square symbolizing Earth" (外圓象天하며 內方象地), hence outer circle and inner square. However, this disc (*pi*) also has a round hole in the center, making both inner and outer shapes circular. Made of pale green jade, it measures 7 *ch'on* (寸, approx. 21cm) in diameter, 2 *pun* (分, approx. 6mm) thick, with the central hole diameter over 1 *ch'on* 6 *pun* (approx. 5cm). Both front and back surfaces are fully decorated with low relief carvings: the inner ring with millet grain patterns (粟粒文) and the outer ring with coiled dragon patterns (蟠虯文).
(石印, 刀子 等, Stone seals, knives, etc.): Knife types have nothing particularly noteworthy, but the neck of the stone seal is also decorated with carvings, resembling modern seals.
Relics arranged inside the chamber, i.e., burial goods (副葬品), include bronze and iron products like jars (壺), basins (洗, 盥器), Boshan incense burners (博山爐), bronze vessels (銅器), portable cosmetic cases (携奩), cauldrons (釜), and pottery jars (壺) and urns (甕), placed in order.<126> The portable cosmetic case (携奩) is a cylindrical bronze vessel with three legs and a lid. It has rings on both sides, attaching a handle (提梁) with chains (鎖), and further connecting the handle and lid with chains and rings. It stands about 7 *ch'on* (approx. 21cm) high, 4.5 *ch'on* (approx. 13.5cm) in diameter, and 1 *pun* (approx. 3mm) thick. Its shape is still well-preserved. Some jars and urns contained residual fish bones. Other items include crossbow mechanisms (弩機), arrows (箭, 矢), spears (矛), and other weapons, as well as glass beads (琉璃製의 珠玉). Among them, the black lacquered table (案) and the bronze mirror (靑銅의 鏡) are objects of endless admiration for their skillful craftsmanship.
(Table, 案): Bear-shaped legs stand at the four corners, serving as feet. Similar to how lions on a lion pagoda support the pagoda, here bears support the table. It is inlaid (嵌裝) with gold, silver, and precious stones, displaying exhaustive design (意匠). Furthermore, it possesses patterns of clarity and elegance hardly imaginable elsewhere. On the pure black background, the brilliant five-colored designs have not changed their original form despite the passage of many years. As the oldest dated painting, it is a highly valued treasure as a type of pattern painting (模樣畫).
(Bronze Mirror, 銅鏡): This is the so-called Han mirror (漢鏡). The back has a round knob (圓鈕) protruding in the center. Four leaf shapes (葉形) are drawn around it, and in the spaces between, the four seal script characters (篆字) for "Long ears, descendants" (長耳子孫) are inscribed. Hence, it is sometimes called the "Long ears, descendants mirror" (長耳子孫鏡). Outside this, eight inward-facing semi-circles (內向半圓形) are arranged, and in the gaps, the eight seal script characters "Longevity like metal and stone, beautiful and good" (壽如金石, 佳且好兮) are inscribed. The border (周綠) is wide, and the middle band (中帶) is covered with patterns made of curved lines and concentric circles.
Indeed, the brilliant luster of gold, silver, precious stones, and artifacts is enough to mesmerize our spiritual eyes.
The above are items discovered within wooden chambers. Then what about the even more exquisitely beautiful brick chambers? How regrettable! Did the ignorant local inhabitants consider the ancient tombs merely as storage places for bricks? Most were destroyed by them for their own use. Consequently, no completely preserved examples remain today. Correspondingly, treasures were either stolen or unearthed by the locals, which is why burial goods are rarely found in brick chambers.
Besides burial goods from ancient tombs, numerous relics have also been found at fortress sites: Wu Zhu coins (五銖錢), bronze wares (銅器), bronze arrowheads (銅鏃), bronze seals (銅印), belt buckles (帶駒), coin molds (錢笵), etc. Their forms are all similar to those of the Han Dynasty, which constitutes their distinct feature.
(The relics mentioned above are housed in the Keijo Museum [京城博物館 所藏])<127>
Near the Ŏŭl-tong Old Fortress in Yonggang, there is a stone stele (石碑), about 4 *ch'ŏk* (approx. 1.2m) wide and 5 *ch'ŏk* (approx. 1.5m) high, inscribed with characters. Most can be deciphered. It records the Marquis of Yŏmch'ŏm (黏蟬侯) praying to the mountain god of P'yŏngsan (平山) for abundant harvests of the five grains and peace within the territory. The characters "黏蟬" (Yŏmch'ŏm) appear in two places. This Yŏmch'ŏm County (黏蟬縣) was one of the 25 counties of Lelang Commandery during the Former Han and one of the 18 counties during the Later Han. This confirms that the aforementioned Ŏŭl-tong Old Fortress was the administrative center of Yŏmch'ŏm County. However, the date is unknown, leading to considerable scholarly debate. Since it lacks a direct, crucial connection to art history, we shall content ourselves with treating it as an ancient stele from the Yŏmch'ŏm County era.
As this is the oldest extant ancient stele, the source that produced masterpieces like the Stele of King Muyŏl of Silla (新羅 武烈王碑) lies in this now almost worn-out stele.

4. Concluding Remarks (餘說)
The above provides an overview of the artistic relics of the Lelang period. Like the relics of the subsequent Koguryŏ period, their survival underground is a major characteristic. Why? Because almost anything that can be called artistically valuable has been discovered in ancient tombs. We, who are forced to excavate these dark underground caves to find them, cannot help but lament our inability to encounter the brilliant works that were constructed above ground during that era. Furthermore, even the relics buried underground have often been stolen or damaged by wind and rain, making it difficult to find even incomplete examples. However, that even these humble remnants sometimes survive to this day due to our social customs can be considered fortunate amidst misfortune.
Of course, this situation is unlike that in China, the supposed place of origin, where people intoxicated by the fever for gold, merely seeking commercial gain, occasionally plunder ancient tombs, turning treasure troves rare in the East and West into thieves' dens and debasing works that should be praised and passed down through the ages. Although related to tombs built underground, the arch (아치) and the bricks used to build it are truly unique architectural methods unparalleled elsewhere. It is only natural to boast proudly to the world of our artistic genius. For us modern people who have despised art, it is suddenly difficult to even imagine the above-ground constructions of that era.
Although we have now fallen into the miserable state of following in the footsteps of foreigners, this peninsula is a land of art, and we are its children. How can we live drunk and die dreaming (醉生夢死), carelessly wasting precious time? Even the remaining blood and fading spirit still leap and surge within our breasts. Following the turn of our minds and the flick of our wrists, it will surely not be difficult, nor a matter of the distant future, to once again build a new Eden of new art on the desolate ancient ruins of the Paedal nation. ...(To be continued)...

**Summary**

This article section by Pak Chonghong discusses the Lelang period (c. 108 BCE – 313 CE) in Korean art history. It outlines the historical context, acknowledging the establishment of Han Chinese commanderies (Lelang, Daifang) but emphasizing that Korean kingdoms like Koguryŏ and Paekche eventually expelled them. The core focuses on archaeological evidence: earthen mound tombs with sophisticated wooden or brick chambers (including dome ceilings and arches dating back 1700 years), fortress sites like Wanggŏm (P'yŏngyang) and Yŏmch'ŏm, and various artifacts found primarily in tombs. These include distinctive roof tiles, lacquered coffins, jade burial items (cicadas, plugs, pigs, *pi* discs), gold belt hooks, bronze mirrors ("Han mirrors"), vessels, weapons, and an inlaid lacquer table. The author laments the loss of artifacts due to looting and decay but highlights the advanced techniques (like arches) as proof of indigenous Korean artistic prowess, even during a period of foreign influence.

From a colonial history perspective, the article is notable for its subtle yet persistent nationalist tone. While acknowledging Chinese cultural influence during the Lelang period, the author frames it as a stimulus that awakened inherent Korean artistic genius ("Paedal people's innate artistic temperament"). He emphasizes Korean agency in ultimately overcoming foreign rule and contrasts Korea's ancient architectural achievements (arches/domes) favorably against contemporary Japan's reliance on Western models, subtly asserting cultural superiority despite Korea's colonized status in 1922. The final paragraphs are a clear call for national artistic revival, linking past glory to future potential, a common theme in cultural nationalism under colonial rule.

第4節 樂浪期

第1. 歷史上의 槪見
樂浪期라 함은 槿花의 疆域이 一部 一時的이나마 外人의 干涉 下에 特殊한 그 文化의 感化를 受入한 時代를 指稱한 者-라. 그리 論擧할만한 價値의 有無는 暫間 別問題어니와 國의 界와 族의 種을 超越하고 濶漫無窮의 公正한 美術的 鑑賞眼으로써 透察할지니 微하며 穉하다고 看過치 못할 者-어늘 又况 그가 비록 殘弱한 餘響일지나 倍達族의 天賦한 藝術的 性情을 刺激하야 後代의 美術上 燦爛한 發花와 顯榮한 結實을 出來케한 原動力을 助成함이리오. 昔에 生而知之하얏다는 孔子도 問樂於萇弘, 問禮於老聃, 問官名於郯子, 學琴於師襄, 是以로 萬古不朽의 賢哲한 素質을 衝奮시킴이 되엇는지라. 우리 樂浪期의 美術도 譬컨대 丹靑에 長한 美術家가 그의 感한 美를 將次 表現코자 喜悅에 充溢한 懊惱에 煩悶할 際에 暫間 他의 形式的 方便이 其民으로 하야금 듸디어 美를 表現치 아니치 못하게 한 者-니 그 幅面에 顯露한 彩畵는 勿論 其士의 手와 腕의 精力으로써 産出한 者-며 其士의 情과 誠의 結晶으로써 成因된 者-라. 어찌 그 形式의 所由來如何로써 그 書畵의 優劣을 云謂할 者-리오.
비록 그의 影響을 不蒙한 자는 아니나 主가 我이며 從이 彼인즉 少許라도 그 中에 忌憚을 不留할지라.
一時溯古하야 此를 探核할진대 史記에
箕子, 本姓子氏, 名須臾, 率中國人五天, 避地朝鮮, 詩書·禮樂·醫巫·陰陽·卜筮之類, 百工技藝皆從焉, 言語不能通,＜120＞ 譯而知之, 遂都平壤, 敎民以禮義·田蚕·織作, 設禁八條, 嫁娶無所售, 是以其民不相盜, 無門戶閉, 婦人貞信, 飮食以籩豆, 有仁賢之風.
箕子의 南遷한 事實에 對하야는 異論이 紛紛하나 遼東近處로써 그의 本地라 할지라도 何如컨 그 影響이 普及되엇슬 것이며 또한 第8代 眞平王 捉은 子母錢을 鑄하고 38代 顯文王 釋은 檀君廟에 祭하얏다 云하니 關係가 不無하얏슴을 可想할지며 鑄造 等이 是時로부터서도 起頭하얏슴을 可知할지로다.
그 後 41代의 哀王 準時에 至하매 燕國 降人, 衛滿을 信寵하야 邊防을 守케 하얏스나 反히 그에게 征服이 되니 於是乎 衛滿은 兵威財力을 得하야 朝鮮이라 號할 새 그 孫, 右渠에 至하야는 驕虐을 是事하다가 前漢 武帝에게 滅亡을 當한 바- 되엇도다. 漢書에
漢武帝元封三年夏, 降以其地, 爲樂浪·臨屯·玄菟·眞番.

4郡
4郡이 玆에 始生하니 元封 3年 卽 西紀前 110年이라. 그 後 27年을 經하야 昭帝始元 5年 (西紀前 82年)에 廢合을 行하야 樂浪, 玄菟의 2郡을 置하얏다가 또 280餘 年을 經하야 漢末獻帝建安 年中에 遼東太守 公孫度의 子, 公孫康이 樂浪郡이 南部 荒地에 帶方郡을 置하얏슴으로 更히 3郡이 되니 三國誌에 曰,
桓靈之末, 韓濊强盛, 郡縣不能制, 民多流入韓國, 建安中, 公孫康, 分屯有縣以南荒地, 爲帶方郡, 遣公孫模, 張敞等收集遺民
桓靈之末이라 함은 漢의 桓帝, 靈帝의 末期를 云謂함이니 即 後漢 獻帝의 初期라. 비록 外面으로는 漢人의 干涉을 受한 듯하나 民心이 또한 韓穢에 歸服하얏던 것임을 推測할지로다. 由是觀之컨대 當時는 오즉 爲政者輩가 渡來하야 各各 그의 權威를 擴張코저 하얏슬 뿐이오. 그 外에 特殊히 今日과 如한 移民의 事業 等은 稀少한 듯하며 다만 歸化의 民이 間有하얏슬뿐인 듯하다. 事理가 當然타 할지니 이미 本心이 아닌지라. 豈可以久하며 固하리오.
北으로는 高句麗가 其勢尤强하야 侵入하며 그와 相對하야 南으로는 百濟가 其氣益盛하야 迫來하니 魏晋以來로＜121＞ 樂浪과 帶方이 日로 侵殺될 새 張統이 二國之間에 介在하야 據코저 하얏스나 連年不解함으로 그 勢를 能히 支久치 못한 바-로다.
遼東張統, 據樂浪, 帶方二郡, 與高句麗王乙弗利相攻, 晋愍帝建興元年, 樂浪爲句麗所倂.
畢竟 建興元年(西紀 313)에는 樂浪이 高句麗에게 奪한 바- 되어 僅히 南退하야 帶方을 守하려하다가 또한 翌年(西紀 314)에 百濟에게 倂하고 마-니
西晋建興二年, 句麗南侵帶方爲張統所據, 遂倂於百濟,
漢武帝가 4部를 置한 後 此 張統이 郡을 棄하고 北歸하기까지 420年 間이라.
이에 遼東에 雄據하얏던 倍達族이 表面의 覇絆까지라도 全然脫去하니 그의 秀麗한 容態가 비롯오 暎照하도다.
是擧가 實로 半島民族의 美術史上 그의 勃興時代를 作케한 所以인뎌

第2. 築造
樂浪期에서 考究할 者는 勿論 4郡에 關한 者-나 4郡의 1로 그中 强盛한 者는 樂浪郡이엇스니 此 樂浪을 探究하면써 그 外 3郡은 推想키 難함도 別無함즉 하기로 今日도 오히려 朝鮮文化의 中心地를 作하고 잇는 當代의 樂浪을 玆에 論코저 하는 바-로다.
樂浪의 郡治址는 王險(平壤)이엇스니 平壤城外 大同江 附近에서 當代의 古瓦를 多數 發見하얏거니와 判然한 그 城址는 江越便에 在하도다. 即 平壤 南 約 1里許 大同江 鐵橋下邊인 大同江 左岸(大同郡 大同江面)에 方이 約 45丁에 至할 土城이 有하니 그 城址로부터 數多한 樂浪時代의 古瓦片과 其他 遺物 等을 發見한 中 古瓦上에 樂浪郡이라는 文字가 歷然이 留在한 者- 等은 그 城址가 樂浪郡治址임을 確認케 하는 者-로다.
土城을 中心 삼아 그의 前面 東西南으로 小丘와 如한 土築의 城壁이 繞圍하고 그 附近 약 1里許에 그 數 可히 1,000餘를 算할 土墳이 散在하도다.
歐洲에서는 所謂 「마운즈」 Mounds라 稱하야 佛蘭西가 最多하고 丁抹, 普魯西 等이 次하며 瑞典의 南海岸으로부터＜122＞ 英吉利, 西班牙, 葡萄牙 等地에 散在하며 더욱 亞弗利加 北部 中央에 多數 散布하얏도다.
亞弗利加 北部는 勿論 5,000年 前의 文明國 埃及의 本地라. 當時에 이미 學術, 技藝가 發達하니 巨大한 「피라밋드」와 「오벨리스크」 「스휭크스」 等을 築營한 民人이 實로 此에 住하얏도다. 그 以前 「마운즈」의 始初도 此에 發하얏슬 것이니 北으로 延하야 歐洲 諸邦에 至하고 東으로 伊太利와 希臘을 通하야 印度에까지 及하니, 이에 亞細亞에 傳來한 嚆矢가 되도다. 印度에서 一段落을 結한 後 또 中央亞細亞를 由하야 西伯利亞에까지 至하니 비록 時代의 相符는 期約치 못할지나 大槪는 그 構造와 形式이 相類한지라.
더욱 此가 南下하야 漢에까지 及하니 未幾에 樂浪에까지 布하얏도다. 即 樂浪의 古墳도 此의 系統을 踏한 者-니 樂浪의 古墳의 構造와 形式이 漢代의 古墳과 相類無異함은 此의 事實임을 證確하는 바-로다.
外形은 平面 四角으로서 上함을 隨하야 狹斜하얏스되 頂上에 至하야는 다시 四角의 平面形을 成한 者-니 大槪는 거의 崩壞하야 土圓塚의 形을 作한지라.
內部는 棺을 納하는 室로써 되니 此를 玄室 或은 玄宮이라 稱하며 或은 槨이라 云하되 槨에는 木槨과 塼槨의 2種이 有하도다.
木槨. 玄室의 壁面은 木材로써 造築한 者-니 天井까지도 巨木으로써 橫覆하며 그 床面에도 亦是 良材를 敷用한지라. 槨內에는 大槪 2個의 木槨을 安置할 새 夫婦合葬이 當世의 常例이엇슴을 可測이며 그 周圍에 皿器 等 許多한 副葬品을 藏置하도다. 此 木槨을 埋葬하야 保存하는 法도 細密히 留意한 者-니 保存을 爲하야 特殊한 加工이 無한 者도 잇스나 槨의 外圍를 塼으로써 包圍하고 그 外面을 更히 粘土로써 防禦하야 直接 土壤과 不觸케 하기도 하며 木炭을 槨周에 堆積하고 그 外部에 礫石을 敷築하기도 하야 永保를 期하얏도다. 어찌 그 奇타 아니하리오.
塼槨. 命名한 바와 가티 塼(煉瓦)으로 그 槨을 築造한 者-니 그의 所用한 塼은 今者의 煉瓦와 그 形이 稍異하야 一端의 中央은 凹入하고 一端의 中央은 凸出하니 連築함에 그 凹凸이 相合할 새 오히려 今者에 比하면 理想的이라 稱할 者-어늘 又况 築上法이 縱橫으로 그 列을 錯交하며 周面에 彫成된 諸種 紋樣이 列을 隨하야 各異함이리오 實로＜123＞ 그 製法이 數層이나 優越한 者-니 다만 驚嘆을 不已할 뿐이로다.
製室法에는 單室 或은 2室, 3室을 連通케한 者도 有하되 壁面은 四面을 幾許間 膨出케 築成하야 周圍의 土壓을 豫防하고 또 그의 積塼法이 善巧하니 即 塼의 紋樣을 隨하야 縱橫으로 順次잇게 一列式 連築하얏스며 此 亦 同期의 慣例에 依하야 夫婦의 兩棺을 幷納함이 普通이라.
天井은 巨木을 幷置하야 上部를 被覆하고 그 表面에 다시 土를 盛蓋하야 土圓塚을 成한 者도 有하며, 그와 構造가 殊異하야 그 巧妙를 盡한 者도 有하니 壁部上隅를 迫持法으로 築造하야 穹窿形의 天井을 成한 者-요. 2室 連續하는 時는 2個의 穹窿天井을 做出하되 그 通路를 作할 새 上部는 「아치」Arch를 成하니 年代를 論하면 後漢末期라 하야도 所不下 約 1,700年 前後로 推定되는 者-라. 嗚呼, 藝術國인 우리 槿花半島, 西曆 2世紀頃에 이미 優妙하고 理想的으로 된 塼을 製造하야 穹窿天井을 築成하며 또한 「아치」를 造作하기 如斯하얏도다.
英國「잉글랜드」에 在한 塚墓 中에는 3室로 區劃하야 壁面이 曲線形으로 造成된 者- 有하나 그러나 우리에게 比할 者- 아니어늘 又况 理想的의 塼으로써 築造함이리오. 同日之論이 아닐진저.
然而 日本은 如何한가. 「아치」를 造하며 穹窿天井을 作하는 等事는 僅僅 維新以來에 屬하는 事요. 그나마 西洋式을 模倣함에 不過한 者-어늘 1,700餘 年 前에 常例로 建築術의 迫特와 如한 妙法을 創始하고 또 技巧하게도 此를 應用한 우리의 先祖, 回顧함에 오즉 漠漠할 뿐이거니와 一面 그의 源流가 尙今토록 不盡하고 熱烈한 우리 臟裡에 循環不巳하니 이에 蘇生코저 하도다. 頹廢의 甚함이여, 다만 何所然을 沒覺하고 愚蠢한 殘生을 維持하야 왓슴이 怪異할 따름이로다.
龍岡邑에서 西方 約 1里半許에 於乙洞 古城이 在하니 方 3丁 假量의 土城을 繞圍할 새 城壁은 東西가 500尺 南北이 400餘尺의 長廣을 有하며 그 近傍에서 拾得한 古瓦는 樂浪時代의 特色을 具有한 者-라, 此亦 樂浪時代 築城의 一例, 더욱 古碑의 發見으로 樂浪郡의 一縣인 黏蟬縣의 治址임을 確認케 되엇도다.
其外 海雲面과 龍月面에는 또 巨大한 古墳羣이 有하야 亦是 木槨과 塼槨의 2種이 有하나 그 形式이 樂浪郡 治址 附近의 者와 無異한즉 다시 論할 要는 無할지라.＜124＞
鳳山, 沙里院에서 약 1里半을 南下하면 方 約 4,5丁의 土壁으로 繞圍된 城址가 有하니 即 「唐土城」 或은 「古唐城」이라 稱하는 者-라. 그 中에 「土城內」라는 一小村落이 有한데 亦是 樂浪郡時代의 古瓦가 多數 發見되니 附近의 古墳에 憑依하야 그가 帶方郡 治址임을 證할 새 或은 未知케라. 至於 末期하야 百濟의 侵壓을 當하게 되매 漸次 退北하야 此에 郡治를 置하얏슴이 아닌가하는 바로다.
沙里院驛에서 線路를 沿下하면 少焉에 鳳山郡 眉山面 鳥江洞에 俗稱 「都塚」이라 하는 一大 土墳을 發見할지라 樂浪郡 治址 附近의 古墳과 同一한 形式의 塼으로써 2個의 玄室을 作하니 塼面에는 各樣의 文字를 刻할 새 其中에 「使君帶方太守張撫夷塼」이라 記한 者가 有한즉 此銘에 依據하야 帶方 太守 張某의 墳墓임을 可知할지며 撫夷라 함은 官名인 듯 하도다. 또 「漁陽張撫夷塼」이라 刻한 塼도 有하니 張撫夷가 漁陽(今에 中國 北京附近에 在한 蘇州)出身임도 推想할지요. 同 太守의 死를 悲歎한 文字가 記錄된 塼도 有하나 다만 副葬品이라고는 一物半件을 不得하니 此亦 亂民의 發掘에 因由된 者일지로다. 此 外에 土城 北部一帶에와 1里餘를 南隔한 銀波 附近의 丘上에 各 20餘 數의 古墳이 羣在하되 皆是 樂浪時代의 形式을 具備한지라.
大槪 帶方郡은 後漢末期에 至하야 公孫康이가 始置한 者인즉 그의 年代數가 稍短할 새 此等의 遺跡은 探遇키 難한 者인저.

第3. 遺物
玆에 遺物이라 함은 鑄造, 彫刻, 制度, 繪畵 等에 關한 遺物의 總稱이라, 然而 其中 多大數를 點한 瓦로부터 論하면
瓦. 그 瓦의 特徵은 中央이 稍突하야 疣瘤와 恰似한 模樣을 成하고 周圍에는 頗廣한 線이 有하며 또 10字形으로 2行의 線을 劃存하매 此線에 依하야 瓦面이 4分되어 잇나니 그 內部에는 渦水紋이 들어잇도다. 大抵 如斯한 形式의 瓦는 漢의 長安附近으로부터 發見되는 者-니 此의 形式이 秦國時代로부터 前漢 後漢을 通하야 樂浪에까지 流布한 者-라. 平瓦는 表裏 兩面에 一種 特殊한 紋目을 有하되 表橫裏縱의 線이 各突하며 頗히 薄廉하니 是亦 樂浪期의＜125＞ 特徵이러라.
棺. 香氣가 尙存한 樟棺이 有하니 可히 高雅하다 稱할지며 棺의 內外面에는 漆을 塗加할 새 兩面이 皆黑한 者도 有하나 大槪가 內面은 黃漆, 外面은 黑漆을 加하니 如斯한 者는 實로 幽邃한 情과 雅麗한 趣를 能現能盡한 者-로다.
彫刻品. 木槨 內에서 發見되는 者가 最多하니 棺내에 在한即 死者의 身邊에 藏置하얏던 者로서 論컨대
(琀)  蟬形을 成할 새 死者의 口中에 含措하는 喪用의 玉,
(鼻塞)  鼻孔에 窒揷하는 角柱의 小玉
(充耳)  耳孔을 塞閉하는 小玉
(帶鉤)  金光이 燦爛한 純金製니 大小의 龍形을 薄浮刻으로서 顯出하얏스되 그 精巧하며 纖雅함은 此에 逾할 者- 업슬지라.
(劒)  常用하는 것과 殊異한 點은 別無하나 珠玉의 裝飾을 多施하얏스며,
(石豚)  豚形의 小玉이니 中國의 古墳에서는 腋下에 2個를 幷出함이 常例이나 此에는 다못 1個를 發見하얏슬뿐이오.
(璧)  背部에 安置하는 平扁한 原盤이니 그 形이 古來로 外圓象天하며 內方象地라 하야 外圓內方한 者-라 하나 此 璧은 中央에도 圓孔이 有하야 內外가 共圓하고 淡綠色의 玉石으로 作하되 徑이 7寸, 厚가 2分에 至하며 圓孔의 徑이 1寸 6分餘 일새 表裏에 共히 內輪에는 粟粒文, 外輪에는 蟠虯文의 薄浮刻을 滿施한지라.
(石印, 刀子 等)  刀子類는 別로 論할 만한 것도 업스나 石印의 頸部에는 또한 彫飾을 加할 새 今日의 印과 相似한 者-라.
槨內에 羅列된 遺物 即 副葬品으로서는 壺, 洗(盥器) 博山爐, 銅器, 携奩, 釜 等의 銅鐵製品과 陶製의 壺, 甕 等을＜126＞ 順次로 列置하니 携奩은 圓筒形의 靑銅器요. 3足과 覆蓋를 附하며 兩側에 環이 有하야 鎖로써 提梁을 著하고 다시 鎖와 環으로써 提梁과 覆蓋와를 戀結하되 高가 約 7寸, 徑이 4寸 5分, 厚가 1分 假量이니 그 形이 尙宛하며 또 壺甕 中에는 魚類의 殘骨 等이 留存되어 잇는 者도 잇섯다. 其他 弩機, 箭(矢) 矛 等 武器類와 琉璃製의 珠玉 等을 排列하얏스며 就中 黑漆의 案과 靑銅의 鏡 等은 製法의 巧妙함에 稱嘆을 不已하는 者-라.
(案)은 4隅에 熊脚이 立하야 脚이 될 새 獅子塔의 獅子가 塔을 戴함과 似하야 此는 熊이 案을 戴하얏도다. 金銀 寶石으로써 嵌裝을 施하되 意匠이 盡하얏다 하겟거늘 又况 鮮明優麗함이 他의 가히 想及키도 難할 紋樣이 有함이리오. 眞純한 黑質上에 5色이 玲瓏한 그 模樣은 世代가 年久라 하나 宛然한 本形을 不變하도다. 繪畵中 年代의 最古함으로 一種의 模樣畫로 至貴한 重寶로다.
(銅鏡)은 所謂 漢鏡이라 稱하야 背面 中央에 圓鈕가 돌기하고 此에 4個의 葉形을 劃하야 그 間隙에 篆字로 「長耳子孫」의 4字를 記하니 由此로 或云 長耳子孫鏡이라할 새 그 外側에는 8個의 內向半圓形을 配하고 間隙에 篆字로써 「壽如金石, 佳且好兮」의 8字를 記한지라. 周綠이 廣濶하며 中帶에 曲線 及 同心圓으로 作成된 紋樣이 遍施되엇도다.
果然 金銀寶石器物 等의 燦爛한 光彩는 吾人의 神眼을 恍惚케 하기 마지 아니하도다.
以上은 木槨 내에 發見된 者-라. 然則 一層 秀麗를 極한 塼槨은 如何 可惜하도다. 土著의 頑愚한 民人이 古墳을 塼甓의 貯藏所와 가티 思量함이엇는지 大槪는 그들의 自家 需用에 補키 爲하야 毁去하여 버리니 今에 完全히 保存된 者- 無하며 딸하 寶物도 盜難을 當하거나 或은 民人의 發掘한 바- 되고 마니 이 또한 塼槨에서 副葬品을 發見치 못하는 源由가 되도다.
遺物로서는 古墳의 副葬品 外에 城址에서 發見된 것도 多數하니 五銖錢, 銅器, 銅鏃, 銅印, 帶駒, 錢笵 等이 是也라. 形式이  擧皆 漢時代와 相類함으로써 그의 具備한 特長이 되도다.
(以上의 遺物은 京城博物館 所藏)＜127＞
龍岡於乙洞 古城 附近에 1個의 石碑가 有하니 幅이 約 4尺, 高가 約 5尺에 至하고 文字가 刻入되어 잇스니 大略은 讀破할지며 黏蟬侯가 平山의 山神에게 5穀이 豐登하고 境內가 平穩키를 祈願한 者-라. 其中 「黏蟬」의 2字가 2個所에 在한지라. 此 黏蟬縣은 前漢時에는 樂浪郡 25縣 中의 1이엇스며 後漢時에는 18縣 中의 1이엇나니 是以로 前者의 於乙洞古城이 黏蟬縣 治址임을 證하도다. 然而 年月은 未詳하야 此亦 世論이 不少한 者인즉 美術史와 緊切한 關係가 無한 以上 吾人은 黏蟬縣時代의 古碑로 此를 取扱함으로써 滿足타할지라.
此의 古碑가 現存한 古碑 中 最古한 者인즉 新羅 武烈王碑와 如한 傑作을 出케한 源頭가 今에는 幾乎磨滅하여가는 此碑에 在하얏다 할지로다.

第4. 餘說
以上은 樂浪期의 美術的 遺物의 槪見이니 其後 高句麗時代 遺物과 가티 그 遺存上 地下에 埋藏되어 잇슴이 一大 特色이라. 何者 某物을 莫論하고 그가 美術的 價値를 有한다고 稱할만한 者는 皆是 古墳 中에서 發見되엇도다. 不得已 地下의 幽窟을 穿鑿하야 그를 求하는 吾人은 地上에 建設되엇든 當代의 燦然한 그 作品에 對치 못함이 恨嘆하기마지 못하는 바-어늘 又况 地下에 埋藏되엇다는 遺物까지도 或은 盜難을 當하며 或은 風雨에 瀑洒되어 그 不完全한 者에나마 探遇치 못함이리오. 然而 吾人의 社會的 慣習으로서 그 微賤한 者이나마 只今까지 間或 尙存한다 함은 또한 一便으로 不幸 中 多幸이라 할지로다.
勿論 彼本源地라는 稱을 밧든 中國의 그 尙且拜金熱에 醉溺한 民人이 다만 商賈적으로 金玉을 貪하야 間或 古墳 等을 探毁할 새 東西 稀有의 寶庫를 賊窟로 變하며 萬古에 累傳하야 稱揚할 그의 作品을 卑俗化함에 比類할 者는 아니로다. 비록 地下에 營造된 古墳에 關한 者이로되 「아치」와 또한 그를 築成한 塼은 實로 他邦無類의 獨特한 建築法이 아니리오. 世界에 널리 美術的 天才임을 豪誇함에 躊躇치 아니한다 함도 當然할지니 美術을 賤視하야 온 近代의 吾人으로서 當代의 地上營造는 推想키 猝難할지로다.
今에 비록 外人의 後塵을 拜하는 慘景에 陷至하얏스나 此 美術國인 우리半島, 그를 母鄕으로 둔 吾人, 豈可以 醉生夢死하야 悠悠하게도 寸陰을 妄費할 者-리오. 그의 殘血, 衰氣나마 우리의 胸裏에서 尙躍尙張하니 吾人의 頭腦 吾人의 手腕, 그 一轉一揮를 隨하야 또다시 倍達國의 荒漠한 古墟에 新美術로 새로운 「에덴」의 동산을 建成함도 決코 難事가 아닐지며 또 遙遠한 未來事가 아닐지로다. ...(未完)...
