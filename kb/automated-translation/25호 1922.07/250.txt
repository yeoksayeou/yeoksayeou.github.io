將別里
						金素月

Soft pink *chŏgori*, glowing red,
In P’yŏngyang, the famed Changbyŏlli,
Rain of gold thread, silver thread,
Falls slanted, scattering.

On the coarse, snake-patterned Western umbrella,
The falling fine rain,
Above and below, it falls, scattering.

In the middle of the flowing Taedonggang,
A flock of crying, whirling birds,
In the middle of my parting from you,
The rain falls without cease, scattering.<149>

**Summary**

This poem by Kim So-wŏl depicts a scene of parting in Changbyŏlli, a place near P’yŏngyang by the Taedong River. The speaker observes the fine rain falling, comparing it to gold and silver threads, landing on an umbrella with a snake pattern. The melancholic atmosphere is heightened by the image of crying, whirling birds over the river, mirroring the speaker's sorrow during a separation from a loved one. The poem evokes a strong sense of place and mood through visual and auditory imagery, typical of Kim So-wŏl's lyrical style. From a historical perspective, the poem offers a glimpse into the personal emotional landscape during the Japanese colonial period, using evocative Korean language (including older spellings) to express sorrow and loss. Historians might find interest in its portrayal of a specific locale (P’yŏngyang, Changbyŏlli, Taedong River), the use of vernacular Korean from the 1920s, and its reflection of individual sentiment within the broader context of the era.

						金素月
軟粉紅저고리, 빩안불부튼
平壤에도 이름놉흔 將別里,
金실銀실의 가는비는
비스틈이도 내리네 뿌리네.

털털한 배암 紋徽돗은 洋傘에
나리는 가는비는
우에나 아레나 나리네, 뿌리네.

흐르는大同江, 한복판에
울며 돌든 벌새의떼무리,
당신과 離別하든 한복판에
비는 쉴틈도업시 나리네, 뿌리네.＜149＞
