Article Type: 시 (Poem)

Having cleansed this body stained by worldly dust (紅塵) in the green waves (綠波),
Making a friend of a small boat (一葉舟), I lie down on the Five Lakes (五湖).
Ah (어저버), the pleasures of spring (三春行樂), were they but a dream, I wonder.

Hated, still my beloved; loved, still my beloved.
That galloping boy (馳馬郞), that fickle one (輕薄子), how could they ever know
That late at night, when the cock crows for dawn (鷄鳴晨), I cry, embracing the quilt (擁衾).<145>

**Summary**

This article presents two traditional Korean poems (*sijo*) by Yi Sangjŏng. The first poem expresses a desire to escape the troubles of the world ("worldly dust") by retreating into nature (symbolized by "green waves" and the "Five Lakes"), reflecting nostalgically on past spring pleasures as possibly dreamlike. The second poem voices the lament of a lover, likely female, whose partner ("galloping boy," "fickle one") is unaware of her nighttime tears and enduring affection despite potential mistreatment. From a historical perspective, the publication of *sijo* during the Japanese colonial period signifies the continuation of Korean literary traditions despite cultural pressures. The themes, while personal and traditional, might subtly reflect broader feelings of sorrow or a yearning for escape prevalent during that era, conveyed through established poetic forms.
