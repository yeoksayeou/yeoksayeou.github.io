**Summary**

This "Social Diary" for May-June 1922 chronicles a variety of events in Korea under Japanese rule. It notes activities of Korean organizations like the Ch'ŏndogyo Youth Association, Korean Youth Federation, and Korean Education Association, including publicity campaigns, lecture tours, and meetings. Significant events include the deaths and funerals of Prince Yi Chin and Ch'ŏndogyo leader Son Pyŏnghŭi, the release from prison of March 1st Movement figures O Hwayŏng, Yi Kapsŏng, and four women from the Patriotic Women's Association, and the reburial of activist Yang Hanmok. Cultural and educational developments mentioned are the first Korean Art Exhibition, the establishment of the "Puin" women's magazine and P'yŏngmin Taehak (Commoners' University), a donation expanding Hwimun School, and student issues like a suicide at Paejae School and a strike at Sungsil School. The diary also covers political changes in China (presidential resignation/appointment) and Japan (cabinet resignation, new PM, promotions affecting Korean administration officials like Akaike and Maruyama), international conferences (Genoa, Pan-Pacific, Hague), a violent crime in Suan, and the arrival of the Japanese battleship Mutsu.

From a historical perspective, the article vividly portrays the multifaceted reality of colonial Korea. It highlights the simultaneous existence of Japanese administrative control (promotions, hosting the Mutsu) and continued Korean nationalist sentiment and cultural activity (funerals for revered figures, release of independence activists, educational/social organizations, publications). The juxtaposition of events like the establishment of educational institutions and tragic student incidents (suicide, strike) reveals the pressures and aspirations within Korean society. The detailed reporting on figures associated with the March 1st Movement (Son Pyŏnghŭi, O Hwayŏng, Yi Kapsŏng, Yang Hanmok) and the attention given to Korean organizations demonstrate the ongoing significance of the independence movement and Korean civil society efforts during the so-called "cultural rule" period. Historians might find the specific dates, names, organizational activities, and the blend of political, social, and cultural news useful for understanding the dynamics of this era.
