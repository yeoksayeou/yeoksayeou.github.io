Article Title: 東洋에서 自働車 第一 먼저 타니가 누구일가 (Who Was the First Person to Drive an Automobile in the East?)
Author: Not Specified
Article Type: 잡저 (Miscellaneous writing)

**Body Text Translation:**
Who was the very first person to drive an automobile across the three countries of China, Chosŏn, and Japan? Truly, if one were to find interest in it, it is a kind of interesting story. It is said that the first person to drive an automobile was Teacher Son Pyŏnghŭi, who passed away recently. Among the three countries of the East, the first place where an automobile was seen was Japan, and the first person in Japan to possess an automobile was precisely Teacher Son. Around the 36th year of Meiji in Japan [1903], Teacher Son was in exile in Japan. At that time, an exposition was held in Osaka, and a certain American exhibited two automobiles. Seeing these, Teacher Son immediately purchased one of them, learned how to drive from the exhibitor, and drove himself, speeding through the city of Osaka while still wearing his topknot, *kat* (traditional hat), and Chosŏn clothes (there is a photograph from that time). Not only that, Teacher Son was not only skilled at driving an automobile, but he was also exceptionally good at riding a bicycle; it is said that if a bicycle race were held, he would surely defeat Ŏm Poktong. Furthermore, the remaining automobile from the Osaka Exposition at that time was purchased by the Japanese Imperial Household Ministry (宮內省), but they reportedly felt quite disappointed that the other one had been preemptively acquired by a visiting Chosŏn person.<59>

**Summary**

This article from the July 1922 issue of *Kaebyŏk* magazine claims that Son Pyŏnghŭi, a prominent Korean religious and independence movement leader who had recently passed away, was the first person in East Asia (specifically Korea, China, and Japan) to own and drive an automobile. It recounts how Son, while in exile in Osaka, Japan around 1903, purchased one of two cars exhibited by an American at an exposition, learned to drive it, and drove it himself through the city streets while dressed in traditional Korean attire (topknot, *kat*, and *hanbok*). The other car was bought by the Japanese Imperial Household Ministry, which was reportedly disappointed that a Korean had acquired the first one. The article also mentions Son's proficiency in bicycling, suggesting he could beat famous cyclist Ŏm Poktong. For historians, this piece offers a fascinating anecdote illustrating Son Pyŏnghŭi's modern outlook and perhaps a subtle assertion of Korean precedence over Japan in adopting certain aspects of modernity, even during a period of Japanese encroachment. The image of Son driving in traditional clothes is particularly striking, symbolizing a blend of tradition and modernity.
