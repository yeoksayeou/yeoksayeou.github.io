Company Announcement

Reform of the Hamnam Branch Office

In order to quickly commence new activities in the Hamnam region, where the enthusiasm for reading (讀書熱) is surging daily, we have first newly appointed Mr. Kim Kil-u as the Hamnam Branch Manager and are expanding the various operations of the said branch office. We ask the distinguished individuals within the province to provide twice the previous support and aid.

Location of the Hamnam Branch Office
Chung-ni, Hamhŭng-myŏn, Hamhŭng-gun

Kaebyŏk Company <29>

**Summary**

This is a company announcement from the Kaebyŏk magazine publishers detailing the appointment of Kim Kil-u as the new manager for their Hamnam (South Hamgyŏng Province) branch office. It notes the increasing "reading fever" in the region as the reason for expanding operations there and requests continued support from local readers and influential figures. From a historical perspective, this short notice is interesting as it reflects the publisher's efforts to expand its reach and influence into provincial areas during the Japanese colonial period. It also highlights a perceived growth in literacy or intellectual curiosity ("reading fever") outside the capital, which publishers like Kaebyŏk aimed to capitalize on.
