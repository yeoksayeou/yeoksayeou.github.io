Three Siblings
						Yohan

When the younger siblings were still nursing infants,
The eldest daughter already went to school with her book bundle.
But like a morning glory withered before sunrise,
The year she was to graduate, she went to her grave.

Ten years passed without a word.
The second daughter finished school and became
A young woman of marriageable age in the village. But not long after,
She caught pneumonia and followed her older sister.

The third daughter threw down her book bundle
And became a revolutionary, leaving home.
After waiting for news from the north,
After three years, her corpse arrived by train.

Now, on the three gravestones sitting neatly in a row,
Moss just grows green in the summer... <106>

**Summary**

This poem by "Yohan" tells the tragic story of three sisters. The eldest dies just before graduating school. Ten years later, the second dies of pneumonia shortly after finishing her education. The third sister abandons her studies to become a revolutionary, leaves home, and her body is returned three years later. The poem ends with the image of their three gravestones covered in moss. The poem starkly portrays the premature deaths of young women in early 20th-century Korea due to illness and political turmoil. For historians, it offers a glimpse into the harsh realities faced by women, the prevalence of fatal diseases like pneumonia, and the dangerous path of political activism during the colonial period, reflecting themes of loss, sacrifice, and the fragility of life under difficult circumstances.

						요한
동생들이 아직도 젓먹이 일적에
큰 처녀는 벌서 책보들고 학교에 갓섯다.
그러나 해뜨기 전에 시들른 나발꼿가티
졸업할 그 해에 그는 무덤으로 갓다.

십년이 말업시 지나갓다.
둘재 처녀가 학교를 마치고 동리에
말거러만흔 색시가 되엇다. 그러나 얼마 안잇서
그는 폐염에 걸녀 형의 뒤를 따라갓다.

셋재 처녀가 책보를 집어 던지고
혁명당이 되어 집을 떠낫다.
북쪽으로 오는 소식을 긔다리던 끗헤
삼년만의 그의 시테가 긔차에 실려왓다.

시방은 가즈런히 안즌 세 비석에
녀름이면 익긔가 파랏케 날 뿐...＜106＞
