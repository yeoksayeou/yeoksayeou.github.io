A Proclamation to the Confucian Scholars of Kyŏngbuk, Especially Urging Deep Reflection from the People of the Andong Region
						RJH-saeng

The system of Eastern morality—be it the closeness of father and son, the righteousness between ruler and subject, the distinction between husband and wife, the order between elders and juniors, or the trust between friends—all are gifts of Confucianism. In this age, where the world is distant and people are gone, the origins of Confucianism have become submerged, and there is no way to foster the Three Bonds and Five Relationships. Recently, the Confucian Revival Association (儒敎振興會) has been widely promoted; who would not agree with its purpose? Those supposedly engaged in the Confucian circles (儒林) have all become members of this revival association. However, like the words of the ancient sage, "A narrow-minded scholar cannot be told about the Way (曲士不可以語於道)," the narrow-minded scholars of the villages, with the dark vestiges of the rotten medieval past reviving, are fanning the embers of disastrous factional disputes (黨派是非) through the poisonous lingering effects of empty talk and hollow theories. Is this what the Confucian Revival Association should be doing? The purpose of the Revival Association surely cannot be this. Is it the work of Confucian followers (儒子) to put the truth of Confucianism thousands of miles away and immerse themselves only in disputes that bring hundreds of harms and not a single benefit?

Recent examples of causing calamities within families through struggles between flesh and blood, or reenacting ugly scenes of biased factionalism include: the dispute over the enshrinement (配享) of Taesan and Sosan during the restoration of Kosan Sŏwŏn (高山書院); the Rosang (路上) versus Roha (路下) dispute during the restoration of Kyŏngam Sŏwŏn (敬庵書院) by the Hayang Hŏ clan (河陽許氏); the disputes over Paekkok (栢谷) versus Nabok (螺腹) during the restoration of the Sŏwŏn (書院) of the T'agyŏng Kim clan (濯纓金氏); the lineage dispute (宗系是非) of the Han'gŏndang Kim clan (寒喧堂金氏); the Wŏlch'on (月村) versus Pian (比安) lineage dispute of the Yidong U clan (易東禹氏); between the Kim (金) and Yu (柳) families of Ch'ŏnjŏn (川前) and Sudok (水谷), calling each other 'shrine thief' (廟賊) or 'hall thief' (堂賊), and reportedly administering private flogging (笞刑) while acting as academy caretakers (院直) or hall caretakers (堂直). Are the academy and hall caretakers, though employed as servants by profession, permitted to act in such a way from a humanitarian standpoint? Is this the morality of Confucius (孔子)? Is this the learning of Cheng-Zhu (程朱)? Is it in the internal regulations of the Revival Association? It is said that placards (牌旨) recording mad words and absurd talk have been exchanged. Have the actors in these scenes, perhaps in special backrooms or dramatic outbursts under the backdrop of the Revival Association, wasted thousands or tens of thousands of won of precious public funds amid all this turmoil? This pathetic spectacle, cold to the heart and chilling to the bone—what is it if not tying oneself up with one's own ropes (自繩自縛)?

Do they consider it Confucianism to only engage in such disputes, ignoring beyond consideration that their own sons and nephews (子侄네) wander lost with no place to study, and without even dreaming of public works (共公事業)? Repent here and now, awaken here and now. I hope they become true Confucian scholars (儒林) and strive for the true revival of Confucianism.＜40＞

**Summary**

The article is a sharp critique by "RJH-saeng" directed at the Confucian scholars (Yurim) of Kyŏngsangbuk-do province, particularly those in the Andong region, in 1924. The author laments that despite the establishment of a Confucian Revival Association, these scholars are preoccupied with reviving old, damaging factional disputes based on lineage, academy rituals, and historical grievances, rather than focusing on the core ethical teachings of Confucianism or addressing pressing social needs like education and public projects. The author lists several specific recent disputes as evidence of this counterproductive behavior, calling it a waste of resources and a self-inflicted disgrace. The piece urges these scholars to abandon these petty conflicts and dedicate themselves to the genuine revival and practice of Confucian principles. From a historical perspective, this article is significant as it reveals internal tensions and criticisms within the traditional Korean elite during the Japanese colonial period. It highlights the persistence of pre-modern factionalism (often rooted in lineage and scholarly interpretation) and critiques its irrelevance and harmfulness in a changing society, suggesting a struggle between traditionalists clinging to old forms and those urging reform and engagement with contemporary problems. Historians might find it valuable for understanding the state of traditional Confucian institutions and debates about their role and relevance under colonial rule.

東洋道德의 체계는 父子의 親도 君臣의 義도 夫婦의 別도 長幼의 序도 朋友의 信도 모다 儒敎의 賜物이다. 世遠人亡한 今日에 儒敎의 淵源이 湮沒되고 三綱과 五倫의 扶植이 無路하다. 근래 儒敎振興회가 대대적 선전되니 그 취지에 누가 찬동치 아니하리오. 소위 儒林에 종사한다는 자는 擧是振興會員이 되엿다. 「曲士不可以語於道」란 先哲의 말삼과 가티 향촌의 曲士들은 썩어 빠진 中古의 암시가 復蘇되야 空談虛論의 毒流餘波가 反히 참혹하게 망하든 黨派是非의 宿火를 便撥하니 이것이 儒道振興會의 행할 바인가? 振興會의 취지가 결코 그럴 것이 아니다. 儒敎의 진리는 千萬里外에 두고 有百害無一益한 是非에만 몰두하랴는 것이 儒子의 사업인가? 혹은 骨肉相爭의 門禍를 야기하고 혹은 便色是非의 惡光景을 재연하는 최근의 실례를 擧하면 高山書院復興時 大山小山의 配享是非 河陽許氏의 敬庵書院復興時路上 路下是非 濯纓金氏 書院復興時 栢谷이니 螺腹이니 하는 시비 寒喧堂金氏의 宗系是非 易東禹氏의 月村이니 比安이니 하는 宗系是非 川前 水谷 金柳兩門間의 廟賊이니 堂賊이니 하면서 院直이니 堂直이니 하면서 笞刑을 私行한다니 院直과 堂直도 직업상 남의 使人은 되엿지마는 다가튼 사람으로 人道上 감히 행할 바인가? 이것이 孔子의 道德인가 程朱의 학문인가. 振興會의 內規에 잇는가? 狂辭悖談을 기록한 牌旨란 것이 교환이 되얏다한다. 이런 波瀾이 모다 振興會의 배경 밋헤서 特種의 화장실에서 혹은 氣分劇을 혹은 滑稽劇을 그 장면의 役者들이 귀중한 公財를 멧 천원 멧 만원이나 소비하엿는가? 心寒骨冷한 醜態 이것이 自繩自縛이 아니고 무엇인가. 자기 子侄네는 취학할 곳이 업서 미로에 방황함도 尋劸�度外로 보고 共公事業은 꿈에도 생각이 업고 그런 是非만 하는 것을 儒敎로 아는가. 이 자리에서 悔改하고 이 자리에서 각성하라. 참다운 儒林이 되야 참다운 儒敎의 振興에 노력하기를 바란다.＜40＞
