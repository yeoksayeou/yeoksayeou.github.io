Admonitions
						Goryeo Yi Kyu-bo

Admonition to the Face (面箴)
When there is shame in the heart, you [the face] must first show embarrassment. Your color reddens like cinnabar, sweat drips like water. Facing others, you cannot lift your head, averting your gaze, looking down and away. What the heart does is thus transferred to you. All gentlemen practice righteousness and also discuss it. Be able to express it from within, do not cause yourself [the face] shame.

Admonition to the Waist (腰箴)
Always straight, not bent like a bow, one invites people's anger and blame. Able to bend like a stringed instrument's sound, one distances oneself from disgrace. Indeed, people's fortunes and misfortunes are tied to your bending and stretching.

Admonition to Thought (思箴)
When I hastily do something, I regret not having thought about it. If I think and then act, how could misfortune follow? When I hastily speak, I regret not thinking again. If I think and then speak, how could disgrace pursue? When thinking, do not rush; rushing leads to many errors. When thinking, do not deliberate too deeply; deep deliberation leads to much doubt. Deliberate and find the middle way; thinking three times is most appropriate.

Admonition concerning Lice (虱箴)
Where do lice come from? Nothing is as insidious as you. You enter deep into seams, where the eye cannot reach. You often hide in the bottom of trousers (褌), where the hand cannot get to. You think you have a clever plan, biting people without stopping. People cannot bear the irritation, they certainly cannot endure and ignore it. They feel and search for you, throwing you into the blazing fire. If the blazing fire doesn't take you, they throw you to the greedy ants. If the greedy ants don't take you, the fingernails will also get you. Lice, O lice! Do not hasten your own death.＜76＞

**Summary**

This article presents four classical "admonitions" (箴; Jam) written by the Goryeo Dynasty scholar Yi Kyu-bo. These short pieces offer moral guidance directed metaphorically at parts of the body or concepts: the face (reflecting inner shame), the waist (representing prudence and flexibility), thought (emphasizing deliberation before action or speech), and lice (warning against insidious, harmful behavior that leads to self-destruction). For historians studying the Korean colonial period, the publication of these Goryeo-era moral texts in the nationalist magazine *Gaebyeok* in 1921 is noteworthy. It suggests an effort to cultivate national character and draw upon historical Korean wisdom during a time of oppression, possibly as a subtle form of cultural resistance or a call for ethical conduct and prudence among Koreans. The allegory of the louse might have resonated with readers experiencing hidden forms of oppression or internal societal problems.
