The Political Ideals and Philosophical Thought of Master Yulgok
						One Reporter

To introduce the Political Ideals and Philosophical Thought of Master Yulgok (栗谷先生) more thoroughly, we now excerpt directly from the Master's writings, the *Man'ŏn pongsa* (萬言封事) and *Tap Sŏng Howŏn sŏ* (答成浩原書), presenting them in their original text.

I. Man'ŏn pongsa (Ten Thousand Word Memorial) (Kapmu Year [1594, but Yulgok died 1584, likely refers to an earlier submission, perhaps the 1574 one])

I, your humble servant, observe that in governance, knowing the times is crucial, and in affairs, seeking substance is essential. To govern without knowing the suitability of the times, or to manage affairs without striving for practical results—even if sages and worthies meet, the effects of governance will not be achieved. Humbly considering Your Majesty's intelligence, heroic resolve, fondness for scholars, and love for the people; internally, there is no indulgence in the pleasures of music, wine, or women; externally, the vices of hunting expeditions are shunned. All those things by which ancient rulers corrupted their hearts and harmed their virtue are disdained by Your Majesty. You rely on seasoned elders, promote those with popular support, widely recruit talented individuals, the path to office is gradually clearing, you generously tolerate direct speech, public opinion flourishes, and both court and country eagerly anticipate the arrival of perfect governance. It seems appropriate that discipline should be restored and the people's livelihood should be joyful. Yet, speaking of discipline, favoring private interests and scorning the public good remains as before; orders are not followed, as before; the hundred officials neglect their duties, as before. Speaking of the people's livelihood, households lack stable property, as before; people wander displaced, as before; licentiousness and wrongdoing persist, as before. I have often lamented this and secretly wished to deeply investigate the cause and convey it to the throne, but have not had the opportunity. Recently, seeing Your Majesty's edict to the high ministers prompted by the natural disaster, Your Majesty also expressed great doubt and deep lament, desiring to hear measures for recovery. This is truly the moment for devoted officials to speak their minds fully! Alas, the ministers were overly alarmed and their words failed to convey their full intent. Indeed, the occurrence of disasters stems from Heaven's profound will, certainly difficult to fathom, yet it is nothing more than [Heaven's] benevolence and love for the ruler. Observing the past, when wise kings and righteous rulers could have acted but their governance perhaps faltered, Heaven invariably showed warnings to alert them. As for tyrannical and abandoned rulers who are estranged from Heaven, disasters paradoxically cease. Therefore, the disaster of having no disasters is the greatest disaster under Heaven. Now, with Your Majesty's sagacity, occupying a position where action is possible, in a time when action is possible, yet discipline is as it is, and the people's livelihood is as it is, then the responsibility entrusted by August Heaven has not been fulfilled. Even if auspicious stars appeared daily and celebratory clouds rose daily, Your Majesty's apprehension should find no relief. That numerous disasters appear repeatedly, with hardly a day passing without one, is truly the utmost expression of August Heaven's benevolence and love. How can Your Majesty's vigilance and self-cultivation slacken even slightly? However, without knowing the suitability of the times and without striving for practical results, even if apprehension is keen, the effects of governance will ultimately be remote. How can the people's livelihood be secured? How can Heaven's wrath be appeased? I shall now exhaust my meager understanding, first presenting the chronic ailments and then addressing the measures for recovery. I humbly wish Your Majesty to open your heart, calm your spirit, not tire of the lengthy text, nor be angered by its directness, <40> and apply your sagacious discernment. What is meant by "suitability of the times" (時宜, *siŭi*) is adapting to the times, establishing laws to save the people. Master Ch'ĕng (程子) said regarding the *I Ching* (易): "Knowing the time and recognizing the situation is the great method of studying the *I Ching*." He also said: "Changing according to the times is the constant way." Generally, laws are established based on the times; when times change, laws differ. When Sun (舜) succeeded Yao (堯), it seems nothing should have differed, yet he divided the nine provinces into twelve. When Yu (禹) succeeded Sun, it seems nothing should have differed, yet he changed the twelve back to nine. How could the sages have delighted in making changes? It was merely adapting to the times. Therefore, Master Ch'ĕng said: "When Yao, Sun, and Yu succeeded each other, their styles and atmospheres also differed slightly." Descending from the Hsia (夏) and Shang (商) dynasties, minor changes are too numerous to list. Speaking of major ones: the Hsia people valued loyalty (忠, *ch'ung*). When loyalty became corrupt, it was remedied with substance (質, *chil*). When substance became corrupt, it was remedied with refinement (文, *mun*). When refinement went unremedied, the world fell into chaos, leading to the strong Ch'in (秦). Ch'in, through tyranny, burned the books of poetry and history and perished. The Han (漢) arose, learned from Ch'in's errors, valued leniency and virtue, and revered classical studies. When its governance decayed, empty formalism lacked real integrity, power shifted to imperial relatives by marriage, flattery and sycophancy became the norm. With the rise of Emperor Kuang-wu (世祖, Sejo), integrity and righteousness were highly praised. Consequently, scholars prioritized reputation and integrity, but the drawback was not tempering integrity with propriety (禮, *ye*), viewing death lightly, and engaging in harsh self-discipline that deviated from the mean. People grew weary of this, and lacking a virtuous ruler to remedy the situation, harsh integrity transformed into the unrestrained abandon of Wei (魏) and Chin (晋), valuing emptiness, neglecting propriety and law. With propriety and law lost, there was no difference from barbarians. Thus, the Five Barbarians (五胡, Ohu) ravaged China, and the Central Plains disintegrated. When chaos reaches its extreme, order is due. Thus arose the reign of Chŏnggwan (貞觀) [under T'ang T'ai-tsung], but the remedy for the ills was incomplete, still retaining barbarian customs. The Three Bonds (三綱, *samgang*) were incorrect: ruler not acting as ruler, minister not acting as minister, military governors (*pŏnjin*, 藩鎭) disobedient, powerful ministers arrogant. Decline led to the chaos of the Five Dynasties. The Sung (宋) arose, learned from the trouble with military governors, relinquished military power, and centralized authority. But after Emperor Chên-tsung (眞宗), accustomed to peace, discipline gradually slackened, and military strategy declined. Although Emperor Jên-tsung (仁宗) presided over great prosperity, signs of decline were already apparent. Great worthies of the time all considered ways to change and adapt. When it came to Emperor Shên-tsung (神宗), who encountered an opportune moment for change and roused his ambition for action, the one he trusted was Wang An-shih (王安石). [Wang] prioritized profit and utility over benevolence and righteousness, violating [the harmony of] Heaven and man, hastening chaos and ruin. It would have been better not to have changed at all. This led to great disaster, transforming Cathay into barbarian lands. What more needs to be said? Over several thousand years, the traces of order and chaos in successive dynasties are roughly thus. Those who skillfully remedied situations according to the times are seen only in the Three Dynasties [Hsia, Shang, Chou]. After the Three Dynasties, rescuers were certainly few, and their methods were incomplete. Generally, what can be changed according to the times are laws and institutions (法制, *pŏpche*). What cannot be changed throughout antiquity and modernity is the kingly way (王道, *wangdo*), benevolent governance (仁政, *injŏng*), the Three Bonds (三綱), and the Five Constant Virtues (五常, *osang*). In later ages, the way of governance became unclear; what should not be changed was sometimes altered, and what could be changed was sometimes rigidly adhered to. This is why days of order are few and days of chaos are many. Let us also speak of our East [Korea]. The Eight Articles of Kija (箕子八條) lack documentary evidence. During the turbulent Three Kingdoms period, governance and teaching were unheard of. The five hundred years of the preceding dynasty [Koryŏ] were obscured by wind and rain. Coming to our dynasty [Chosŏn], T'aejo (太祖) founded the state, Sejong (世宗) maintained it, initially using the *Kyŏngje yukchŏn* (經濟六典, Six Codes of Governance). Up to King Sŏngjong (成廟), the *Kyŏngguk taejŏn* (經國大典, Grand Code for Ruling the State) was published. Thereafter, laws were established according to the times, called supplementary codes (*songnok*, 續錄). When a sage succeeds a sage, it seems nothing should differ, yet sometimes the *Kyŏngje yukchŏn* was used, sometimes the *Taejŏn* supplemented by *songnok*. This was merely adapting to the times. At those times, proposing new institutions was not considered strange, laws were implemented without stagnation, and the people could recover. During the tyrannical reign of Yŏnsan'gun (燕山), expenditures were extravagant. He changed the tribute laws of the ancestors, daily diminishing the lower [people] to benefit the upper [ruler]. During the Chungjong (中廟) Restoration, governance should have reverted to the old ways, but in the early years, those in power were merely ignorant meritorious subjects. Later, the various worthies of the Kimyo year (己卯, 1519) desired some action, but the blade of slander struck, pulverizing flesh and blood. This was followed by the Ŭlsa Purge (乙巳之禍, 1545), more tragic than Kimyo. From then on, the scholar-official forest (士林, *sarim*) looked back fearfully, holding their breath, deeming survival fortunate, not daring to speak of state affairs. Only the powerful villains acted recklessly as they pleased, deeming what benefited them as old law to be upheld, and what hindered their private interests as new law to be abolished. Their ultimate aim was nothing more than exploiting the people to enrich themselves. Who gave even the slightest thought to the daily decline of the state's power and the daily erosion of the nation's foundation? Fortunately, we encounter a wise ruler [King Sŏnjo] devoted to learning, mindful of the people's livelihood, capable of establishing laws according to the times to rectify the age. Yet, superiors fear repeating the mistakes of Handan [imitating others improperly, i.e., radical change], harboring few thoughts of reform. Ministers, when discussing matters, fear the disaster of Wang An-shih; protecting themselves, they fear the defeat of the Kimyo scholars. None dare speak of reform. Let me try to describe today's governance: the tribute register (*kongan*, 貢案) upholds the oppressive laws of Yŏnsan'gun; personnel selection (*chŏnsŏn*, 銓選) follows the norms of nepotism by powerful villains; literary skill is prioritized over virtue and conduct, so those with esteemed conduct ultimately yield to petty officials; lineage is emphasized while talent is slighted, so those from humble families cannot display their <41> abilities. Royal secretaries (*sŭngji*, 承旨) do not enter the inner chambers to report; close attendants are distant while eunuchs are close; advisory officials (*sijong*, 侍從) do not participate in court discussions; Confucian officials (*yusin*, 儒臣) are slighted while vulgar opinions prevail. Officials do not stay long in one post, deeming rotation through prestigious positions an honor; duties are not divided, entrusting everything solely to the respective ministry (*chosa*, 曹司) as the norm. Detrimental customs and erroneous regulations are too numerous to list, originating if not in Kimyo, then certainly solidified by Ŭlsa. Yet current commentators liken them to the laws of the ancestors and dare not propose reform. This is what is called not knowing the suitability of the times. Generally, even if a sage king establishes laws, if there are no worthy descendants capable of adapting them, flaws will eventually arise. The Duke of Chou (周公) was a great sage, yet ruling Lu, he could not prevent its later decline. T'ai Kung (太公) was a great worthy, yet ruling Ch'i, he could not avert the later usurpation. If worthy descendants in Ch'i and Lu had skillfully followed the inherited intentions and not been rigidly bound by laws, would there have been the calamity of decline and chaos? In our country, the laws established by the ancestors were initially extremely thorough, but after two hundred years, times have changed, circumstances have altered, and flaws inevitably exist that could still be reformed. How much more so the erroneous regulations of later days, which urgently need reform like extinguishing a fire or rescuing the drowning! The *Classic of Changes* (傳曰) says: "When blocked, change; when changed, passage is achieved." I earnestly wish Your Majesty to consider this and think of ways to change and adapt. What is meant by "practical results" (實功, *silkong*) is acting with sincerity (誠, *sŏng*), not engaging in empty talk. Master Tzŭ-ssŭ (子思子) said: "Without sincerity, there are no things." Mencius (孟子) said: "There has never been utmost sincerity that did not move others." If there is practical effort, how can there not be practical results? That the effects of governance are not achieved today is due to the lack of practical results. There are seven points of concern: Lack of mutual trust (交孚, *kyobu*) between ruler and ruled is the first concern. Lack of commitment to duty among ministers and officials is the second concern. Lack of accomplishment in the Royal Lectures (經筵, *kyŏngyŏn*) is the third concern. Lack of practical employment in recruiting the worthy is the fourth concern. Lack of response to Heaven in times of disaster is the fifth concern. Lack of measures to save the people among various policies is the sixth concern. Lack of inclination toward goodness in people's hearts is the seventh concern. What is meant by the lack of mutual trust between ruler and ruled? The interaction between ruler and minister is like the encounter of Heaven and Earth. In the *I Ching*, the hexagram Kou (姤) symbolizes: "Heaven and Earth encounter each other, and all things achieve manifest form." Master Ch'ĕng's commentary says: "If Heaven and Earth do not meet, the myriad things are not born. If ruler and minister do not meet, governance does not flourish. If sages and worthies do not meet, the Way and Virtue do not prosper. If things do not meet, function and utility are not achieved." Therefore, when enlightened rulers and good ministers meet, they communicate frankly (liver and gallbladder exposed), are as close as father and son, fit together like tallies. Even the closeness of flesh and blood cannot come between them, and the mouths of slanderers find no place. Only then can words, actions, policies, and appointments possibly achieve success. The sage kings of the Three Dynasties all followed this path. There has never been a case where ruler and minister lacked deep mutual trust and yet could achieve effective governance. Humbly reflecting, Your Majesty possesses abundant intelligence and insight, yet your adherence to virtue is not broad; your love of goodness is not shallow, yet suspicion is not dispelled. Therefore, among the multitude of officials, those who eagerly offer proposals are suspected of overstepping; those who uphold integrity are suspected of affectation; those who gain popular praise are suspected of factionalism; those who denounce wrongdoing are suspected of plotting against others. Furthermore, when issuing decrees, the tone and wording fluctuate, likes and dislikes are unsettled. As for the recent edict, it says: "Grand pronouncements compete for advancement, delighting in unprecedented actions. It seems proper that customs should become pure and governance effective." Once this edict was issued, confusion among the officials increased manifold. The ancients had a saying: "Speaking well is not difficult; acting well is difficult." Shao Yung (邵雍) said: "An age of order values virtue; an age of chaos values words." In the world, past and present, how could competing grand pronouncements ever make customs pure and governance effective? Furthermore, does Your Majesty consider grand pronouncements right or wrong? If right, then these so-called grand pronouncements are merely about guiding the ruler to the proper path, hoping to achieve perfect governance. Your Majesty should hasten to adopt them, not mock them as "competing for advancement." If words are spoken but not used, they are useless even if beautiful. Thus, Tzŭ-ssŭ served as a minister, yet Lu Mu's state grew weaker; Mencius served as a high official, yet Ch'i Hsüan's kingly enterprise did not flourish. How much less so today, when those offering advice are not Tzŭ-ssŭ or Mencius, and there is no sign of their advice being adopted? Why wonder that the affairs of the time are not well-managed? If wrong, then these are wordsmiths stirring up trouble. Your Majesty should suppress frivolity, promote substance, stabilize the court, and calm the people's hearts, not praise grand pronouncements as fine things. Alas! If candid counsel is faulted for its competitiveness, the morale of scholars will be dampened, and deviant paths opened. If frivolity is praised for its grand pronouncements, hypocrisy will grow, and substantial virtue decline. Your Majesty must fall into one of these positions. Or perhaps Your Majesty truly had no deep intent, and the words were merely accidental? Your Majesty's trust in the officials is insufficient, hence the officials also do not know the bent of the Sage's [Your Majesty's] mind. Whenever an imperial edict contains a single unusual word, they are all startled and fearful, constantly feeling as if standing by an unfathomable abyss. When the ministers were summoned recently, they were simply filled with apprehension, without a single plan <42> capable of changing Heaven's mind or saving the world. If the ministers were entirely without insight, that would be one thing. But if they did have insights, was it not because they feared Your Majesty would not lend an attentive ear? Even when appointing a bureau director (*iranggwan*) or filling a vacancy in a minor prefecture (*ch'an'ŭp*)—matters where the Sage's concern for the people surely involves nothing else and is not unusual—court officials with good reputations all feel insecure. Is this not because Your Majesty's sincerity has failed to inspire trust? The sage kings of old conducted their thoughts and actions like the blue sky and white sun, visible to all things. Even the common people clearly knew the ruler's intentions. Therefore, if killed, they felt no resentment; if benefited, they felt no obligation. Today, even close ministers do not understand the Sage's heart, let alone others. In the past, King Chungjong's relationship with Cho Kwangjo (趙光祖) could be called a meeting of sage and worthy. Yet insidious evil suddenly entered his core, like a bright mirror obscured by dust. By day, he agreed readily on the same couch; by night, [Cho] was cast into a thousand-fathom abyss. The scholar-officials of today, wounded by the bow [of persecution], still gasp for breath. This humble servant once offered his shallow view, saying: "Chungjong was certainly a sagacious ruler, but overly receptive. While the words of gentlemen were easily accepted, the slander of petty men also easily entered." The current sovereign [Sŏnjo] is not so. He examines words thoroughly and does not listen carelessly. Though gentlemen may find it difficult to connect, petty men also dare not deceive with improper ways. In this era of sagacious enlightenment, there will surely be no disaster for the scholar-officials. However, I fear that with the people impoverished and the state weakened, without measures for change and adaptation, there will eventually be a collapse like an earthen landslide. Among the scholars today, how many can trust my words? If mutual trust is lacking in the relationship between ruler and minister, maintaining peace and order has been unheard of from ancient times to the present. This is the first cause for grave concern. What is meant by the lack of commitment to duty among ministers and officials? Offices are established, duties divided, each has its responsibility. The Three Dukes (三公, *samgong*) oversee general policy; the Six Ministries (六卿, *yukchyŏng*) manage various affairs; advisory officials (*sijong*) have the duty of deliberation; the Censorate (*taegan*, 臺諫) bears the responsibility of being ears and eyes. Down to minor bureaus and petty officials, none lack their assigned duties. Provincial governors (*kamsa*, 監司) propagate [royal] influence externally; military commanders (*chŏlsa*, 節帥) lead and supervise on the borders; magistrates (*suryŏng*, 守令) share the burdens [of governance]; garrison commanders (*chinjang*, 鎭將) oversee defenses. None lack their respective duties. Today, the Three Dukes are indeed those upon whom popular hope rests, yet they dare not propose initiatives, merely acting with deference and apprehension. There is little hope they can manage the state's economy or turn the tide of the age. What can be expected of others? High officials drift along above, concerned only with looking before and after. Petty officials drift along below, concerned only with observing the times and seeking profit. Discipline is entirely entrusted to the Censorate, but they merely pick out one or two corrupt individuals to fulfill their duty. Personnel selection stems entirely from solicitations, merely arranging one or two famous scholars to feign impartiality. As for officials in various bureaus, they are utterly ignorant of their duties, knowing only how to accumulate days and months to seek promotion. Among officials great and small, are there not one or two who serve the public and forget private interests? It's just that they are isolated and weak, unable to contribute significantly. Provincial governors tour for their own amusement, judging performance based on the lavishness of receptions and the neatness of documents. How many can clearly administer rewards and punishments? Military commanders use harsh punishments to assert authority and exploit [resources] for self-enrichment, failing both in pacification and training. How many can fulfill their duties without disgracing their external post? Magistrates know only how to extort the people for self-profit and curry favor for reputation. Those who genuinely care for governing and nurturing [the people] are extremely few, countable on one's fingers. Garrison commanders first ask about the number of soldiers only to calculate the amount of cotton cloth [they can extort]. Those concerned with defense are utterly non-existent. Fortunately, there are the clerks (*sŏri*, 胥吏). These types exploit loopholes, seize key positions, and the lifeblood of the people is almost entirely consumed by their hands. As for military conscription, it is a matter of utmost importance, yet bribes are exchanged on the roads, and forged documents confuse the truth. Villagers want to offer cattle, but clerks demand cotton cloth. Cattle are exchanged for cloth, and the price of cattle plummets – this is true both in the capital and provinces. Public outcry is rampant; what about other matters? Ts'ao Chih (曹植) once said: "Our country will perish because of clerks." Though this statement is excessive, it contains some truth. This arises from the failure of officials to fulfill their duties. If each official performed their duties properly, how could clerks cause the downfall of a state? If one thinks the appointees are unsuitable and wishes to replace them, the available pool of talent at any given time is limited, and worthies are hard to discern quickly. If one thinks the laws are not strict enough and wishes to make them harsher, then harsh laws only increase cunning, and besides, harsh laws are not the solution for correcting abuses. If one deems the situation hopeless and leaves it be, then the hundred abuses will increase daily, accomplishments will decline daily, the people's livelihood will become more difficult daily, and chaos and ruin will inevitably follow. This is the second cause for concern. What is meant by the lack of accomplishment in the Royal Lectures? In ancient times, the offices of the Three Dukes were established: the Tutor (師, *sa*) taught the Way, the Instructor (傅, *pu*) transmitted virtue and righteousness, and the Protector (保, *po*) guarded the body. Since this system has lapsed, the responsibilities of Tutor, Instructor, and Protector fall entirely upon the Royal Lectures (*kyŏngyŏn*). Therefore, Master Ch'ĕng said: "The cultivation of the ruler's virtue is the responsibility of the Royal Lectures." The <43> Royal Lectures were established not merely for reading texts, explaining passages, and not missing phrases and sentences. They are intended to resolve doubts and clarify the Way, to accept admonition and advance virtue, to discuss governance and establish order. Thus, the ancestors treated the Royal Lecture officials with propriety and favored them with kindness, like family members, father and son, with feelings completely understood. Today's attending officials often lack learning and sincerity. Some find it difficult to attend and even seek excuses to avoid it. Although, are there not those who harbor sincerity and knowledge, wishing to be close to the sagacious ruler? Recently, Royal Lectures have not been frequent, contact is certainly sparse, etiquette is strict, the atmosphere is constrained, responses are very rare, questions are not detailed, and matters of governance and current problems are never inquired about. Occasionally, one or two lecturers encourage sagacious learning, but this is also met with indifferent listening, showing no sign of personal experience or practical application. After the lecture concludes, the inner palace is deep and remote, and one can only look up with longing. Your Majesty's companions are only eunuchs and palace ladies. Who knows what books Your Majesty reads in leisure, what affairs are handled, what words are heard? Even close ministers cannot know, let alone external officials. Mencius was a near-sage, and the King of Ch'i respected him greatly, yet Mencius still lamented the "one day's sun, ten days' cold" [inconsistent effort]. How much more so today, when attending officials fall short of the ancients and are kept at such a distance? This is the third cause for concern. What is meant by the lack of practical employment in recruiting the worthy? The emperors and kings of old sought the worthy with utmost sincerity, fearing they would not find them. Some were found through dreams, some encountered while fishing. This was not merely to praise the person as worthy and show favor, but to share the heavenly throne with them, allow them to eat the heavenly stipend, and extend favor to the common people. Therefore, they inquired based on public opinion, observed through conversation, tested through actions. If truly known to be worthy, they brought the person close, used their plans, and enabled them to practice their way. This is what is meant by rulers honoring the worthy. Now, Your Majesty's love for scholars and search for the worthy are not inferior to the ancients. Hidden virtues and obscure merits have been almost entirely brought to light – such splendid ceremonies are rare in recent antiquity. However, during recommendations, it is vaguely said "so-and-so is usable," but details of their conduct are never presented. The appointing authorities already fail in their duty. Your Majesty also never personally meets the person to ascertain their worthiness, but merely bestows rank according to precedent. Cultivating oneself and acting virtuously are not done for gain. Among those in the mountains and forests, are there not some who disdain rank and emolument? The ways scholars enter or withdraw from service are certainly not uniform. Some refuse to stoop to minor posts; some keep their talents hidden like treasure in a box, unsold. Your Majesty's recruitment of the worthy merely involves bestowing rank and salary, with no actual meeting, assessment, promotion, or implementation of their way. Therefore, among those appointed through recommendation today, some yield for the sake of parents, some serve due to poverty, some come merely to express gratitude for the favor. I have never heard of a single person coming forth to practice the Way. Seeking the worthy is a most excellent undertaking, yet if its outcome is mere empty formality, how can the path of governance be achieved? This is the fourth cause for concern. What is meant by the lack of response to Heaven in times of disaster? August Heaven is to the ruler as parents are to a child. When parents are angry with their child and express it in words and looks, the child, even if faultless, must become doubly respectful and fearful, observing their expressions and obeying their wishes, only feeling secure when the parents are pleased. How much more so one who has faults? They should especially acknowledge blame, express sorrow, reform their heart, change their conduct, arouse reverence and filial piety, and gain the parents' pleased expression. They should not merely harbor fear and fold their hands behind closed doors. When emperors encounter celestial changes, it is the same. They reflect upon themselves, thoroughly examine flaws in governance. Even if faultless in person and flawless in governance, they should still increase self-cultivation and reverence unceasingly, never excusing themselves as faultless. How much more so one who has personal faults and governmental flaws? They must seek counsel to broaden knowledge, advance the worthy to assist their deficiencies, inspect the people to diligently soothe them, reform abuses to promote good governance. They must strive to remedy past errors and avert Heaven's wrath. They should not be alarmed and helpless, like a guilty child folding hands behind closed doors, waiting for the parents' anger to subside on its own. In recent years, common disasters occur frequently, and people have become accustomed, not knowing fear. Only because the phenomenon of a white rainbow piercing the sun was extremely ominous and gloomy did the sagacious mind become alarmed and doubly reverent and fearful. Could it be that the turning point from chaos to order is emerging today? Why, seizing this opportunity, have no measures for reform and governance been taken? Avoiding the main palace hall and reducing meals are outward signs of fearing disaster; they are secondary. Advancing in virtue and reforming governance are the substance of fearing disaster; they are primary. Form and secondary aspects certainly should not be abolished. But what about the substance and primary aspects now? This is the fifth cause for concern. What is meant by the lack of measures to save the people among various policies? When laws persist for a long time, abuses arise, harming the people. Devising policies to correct abuses is intended to benefit the people. A royal edict stated: "The ruler depends on the state, the state depends on the people. Establishing the hundred officials and dividing the various duties is solely for <44> the people's livelihood. If the people are distressed and scattered, upon what will the state rely?" Reading this repeatedly, I could not help but feel moved to tears. Great are the King's words! Singular is the King's heart! This is truly a great opportunity to pacify the populace and avert Heaven's wrath! Since the Three Dynasties, how many rulers have known that the duty of ruler and minister is solely for the people's livelihood? However, mere good intentions are not law, and mere law without implementation is not good. Your Majesty's love for the people is certainly thus, yet policies that love the people are still not implemented. Those below who propose policies only address the symptoms, not the root cause. Thus, they sound fine but lack substance when implemented. Today, a plan is proposed to abolish unnamed taxes, yet the levies in the districts remain as before. Tomorrow, a proposal is made to equalize household corvée (*hyŏn'gyŏk*), yet the tax evasion by powerful families continues as before. Reducing the number of *sŏn'up* (*seon'ip*) soldiers [lit. 'selected to go up', likely referring to certain conscripts or laborers sent to the capital] is intended to relieve public slaves (*kongch'ŏn*), yet those who suffer disproportionately remain displaced as before. Banning *pangnap* (防納, paying tax substitutes, often leading to extortion) is meant to avoid burdening the people's finances, yet those who demand bribes (*chugu kŭ ro*, 誅求其賂) become even more rampant. Impeaching and dismissing greedy officials only leads to successors no better than their predecessors, merely creating the trouble of welcoming and sending off. Requesting the selection of border commanders results in those with high reputations being no better than newcomers, yet lacking any sense of restraint. Other fine-sounding decrees and beautiful orders are issued time and again, but districts and counties merely circulate a few lines of text. Villagers remain unaware of what it concerns. For this reason, the upright proposals advanced by gentlemen have utterly no connection to the people's livelihood. People just say, "So-and-so holds high office and enjoys honor, how enviable," but one never hears, "So-and-so was appointed, and his benefits reached the people." Since good words have no effect like this, even if Chu Hsi (朱) and Chi Hsin (汲) filled the court and candid advice filled the ears, what help would it be when the people are destitute, finances exhausted, and the four borders disintegrating? Yet, when just one policy goes wrong, the harm reaches the common people without delay. How strange! Unheard of in ancient or modern times! It is like a great mansion of ten thousand rooms, long unrepaired. From large beams and pillars to small rafters and purlins, all are rotten. Propped up and patched, it barely stands day by day. Try to repair the east, and the west leans and collapses; try to fix the south, and the north warps and breaks. The numerous artisans stand around helpless, nowhere to start. If left unrepaired, the decay worsens daily, heading towards collapse. How is today's situation any different? This is the sixth cause for concern. What is meant by the lack of inclination toward goodness in people's hearts? Moral transformation (敎化, *kyohwa*) has been unclear, and the people scattered for a long time. Although the innate moral sense (秉彝, *pyŏng'i*) exists, it is greatly obscured and eroded. At the beginning of this sagacious reign, people's hearts were stirred, showing considerable inclination towards goodness. If, at that time, sagacious virtue had progressed daily and governance and transformation improved daily, how could the people's hearts today be merely thus? However, because the ministers in the early years failed in their guidance, misleading Your Majesty with shallow standards and consigning the people's livelihood to base levels, although occasionally public opinion emerged from the inherently bright mind, pure discussion remained weak, and vulgar views entrenched. Hearing good words and seeing good people, some admire them for others' sake, some outwardly approve but inwardly resent, some openly point and ridicule. Those who approve from the heart are extremely few. Therefore, the honest and substantial are few, while the false and superficial flourish. Those imprisoned and rescued by the masses are not necessarily innocent; those serving as magistrates and winning popular praise do not necessarily have achievements. Academy recommendations (*kwanch'ŏn*) are meant to seek learning and conduct, yet some lure scholars with feasts. Village selections (*rihyŏp*) are meant to seek uprightness, yet some who abandon conduct and lack shame are chosen. If the person holding the power of appointment (*pyŏn'gwŏn*) also fails to select carefully, then clear and turbid will mix, worthy and foolish mingle, and the abuses will become difficult to remedy. As for the common people, hunger and cold press upon them, their fundamental mind is completely lost. Fathers, sons, and brothers are like strangers on the road; what more can be said of others? The bonds of morality cannot be maintained; laws and punishments cannot restrain. Following the current path without changing current customs, even if sages and worthies were above, there would be no ground to implement teachings. Widely promoting village codes (*hyang'yak*, 鄕約) is certainly a fine endeavor, but this humble servant secretly fears that implementing village codes abruptly with current customs will also fail to establish good mores. This is the seventh cause for concern. These seven concerns are the chronic ailments of the present age. The decay of discipline and the hardship of the people's livelihood stem from this. If these seven concerns are not removed, then even if the sagacious heart toils above and pure discussion flourishes below, there will be no effect in preserving the state and pacifying the people. Since ancient times, when rulers lose virtue and bring ruin upon themselves, it is the natural course of events, nothing to regret. But today, what loss of virtue has the sagacious ruler committed, yet the state's situation is so perilous? Although I am sickly and my talent meager, knowing myself useless, my devoted loyalty is second to none. Entering [the palace], I behold the penetrating brilliance of your sagacious gaze and the clarity of your wise deliberations. Exiting, I look upon the four directions and see the people's suffering and distress, shrunk and unable to advance. I have never failed to deeply wonder, lament eternally, worry my heart, and shed tears. Alas! When illness reaches the vital organs (膏盲, *komang*), a divine physician can still save; when a state is on the verge of collapse, an enlightened king can still revive it. <45> At present, the court is still peaceful, powerful evils have withdrawn, the four borders are still intact, external enemies are not active. As of now, action is still possible. If delayed slightly, the opportunity will pass, and it will be too late. Mencius said: "When the state is at leisure, take this time to repair its governance and laws." I earnestly wish Your Majesty to consider this and think of ways to rouse [the state]. Now, I present the essentials for cultivating the self and pacifying the people, as the way to pray for Heaven's eternal mandate. Cultivating the self is the guiding principle (綱, *kang*), with four specific aims (目, *mok*): First, rouse the sagacious will, aiming to restore the flourishing of the Three Dynasties. Second, strive in sagacious learning, mastering the work of sincerity (誠, *sŏng*) and rectitude (正, *chŏng*). Third, discard partiality and bias, thereby expanding the measure of utmost impartiality. Fourth, associate closely with worthy scholars, thereby benefiting from their enlightening counsel. Pacifying the people is the guiding principle, with five specific aims: First, open the sincere heart, thereby understanding the feelings of those below. Second, revise the tribute register (*kongan*), thereby eliminating the harm of rapacious levies. Third, promote frugality, thereby reforming the custom of extravagance. Fourth, change the *sŏn'up* system, thereby relieving the suffering of public slaves (*kongch'ŏn*). Fifth, reform military administration, thereby solidifying defenses within and without. What is meant by "rouse the sagacious will, aiming to restore the flourishing of the Three Dynasties"? In the past, Ch'ĕng Chien (成覵) said to Duke Ching of Ch'i (齊景公): "He [the sage] was a man; I am a man. Why should I fear him?" "He" referred to sages and worthies. If Duke Ching, with his natural endowments, had roused himself to self-strengthening, he could have achieved the same status as sages and worthies. That is why Ch'ĕng Chien spoke thus. Mencius, speaking to King Hui of Liang (梁惠) and King Hsüan of Ch'i (齊宣), spoke only of the kingly way, urged only benevolent governance. If King Hui and King Hsüan, with their qualities, could have genuinely practiced the kingly way and implemented benevolent governance, they too could have stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the Three Kings [of antiquity]. That is why Mencius spoke thus. How could they have been fond of making grand pronouncements without considering practical results? Humbly observing Your Majesty, your natural endowments are exceedingly fine: benevolence sufficient to protect the people, clarity sufficient to discern villains, decisiveness sufficient to make judgments. However, the will to become a sage is not established, the sincerity to seek good governance is not firm. You regard the former kings as unattainable and retreat into self-limitation, hitherto lacking the spirit of vigorous effort. I do not know what Your Majesty perceives to cause this. Generally, what is meant by "grand ambition but meager talent leading to failure" refers to neglecting self-cultivation while rashly undertaking difficult policies, or not assessing strength and weakness while rashly provoking hard-to-resist enemies. If one's self-cultivation has real substance and one's concern for pacifying the people is sincere, then one can seek the worthy to govern together, reform abuses, and rescue the times. How could this be the "grand ambition leading to failure"? Master Ch'ĕng once said: "Governing a state to the point of praying for Heaven's eternal mandate, nourishing the body to the point of long life, learning to the point of sagehood – these three matters clearly show that human effort can overcome fate. It is just that people do not try." How true this statement is! Since ancient times, it has never been heard that one genuinely applied effort without seeing real results. People today who do not strive for goodness merely have their minds and wills diverted by other things. Governance, teaching, customs, and mores contribute to this. If moral transformation is unclear, human desires are limitless: aspiring to wealth and honor, aspiring to sensual pleasures, aspiring to avoid trouble. For those aspiring to wealth and honor, learning seems contrary to the times, so they shun it. For those aspiring to sensual pleasures, learning involves restraining evil and blocking desires, so they shrink back. For those aspiring to avoid trouble, learning inevitably attracts slander, so they seek exemption. Is this not caused by governance, teaching, customs, and mores? For Your Majesty, it is different. Wealth and honor are already extreme; aspiring to the Way, is this not the means to preserve wealth and honor long-term? Sensual desires must be淡, and what you desire, does it not lie in pacifying the state altars and ensuring the longevity of the national pulse? Calamity may be feared, but does not preventing calamity lie in cultivating one's person and pacifying the myriad people? What does Your Majesty fear that prevents the will from being established? An old saying goes: "Where there is a will, there is a way." I earnestly wish Your Majesty to wash away old views to welcome new ideas, rouse great ambition, aim for perfect governance. Once this ambition is established, then urge and encourage the great ministers, have them lead the hundred officials to change their minds, alter their thoughts, and strive to fulfill their duties. Who then would dare to follow old habits and incur the crime of negligence? If this is done, the affairs of the time may yet be saved, the way of the world may yet be restored, and celestial changes may yet be averted. What is meant by "strive in sagacious learning, mastering the work of sincerity and rectitude"? Although great ambition is established, it must be substantiated by learning. Only then will words and actions be consistent, inner and outer correspond, and the ambition not be betrayed. The methods of learning are spread throughout the canons and instructions. There are three main points: investigating principle (窮理, *kungni*), abiding in reverence (居敬, *kŏgyŏng*), and exerting effort (力行, *ryŏkhaeng*). It is just these. Investigating principle also has multiple aspects. Internally, investigate the principles within oneself: seeing, hearing, speaking, acting each have their norms. Externally, investigate the principles in things: plants, trees, birds, animals each have their proper place. At home, the principles of filial piety, setting an example for one's wife, sincere affection, and rectifying relationships must be examined. In interacting with people, the distinctions between worthy and foolish, upright and deviant, pure and flawed, skillful and clumsy must be discerned. In handling affairs, the subtleties of right and wrong, gain and loss, safety and danger, order and chaos must be scrutinized. One must read books to clarify these, consult antiquity to verify them. This is the essence of investigating principle. Abiding in reverence permeates activity and stillness. In stillness, extraneous thoughts do not arise; one is profoundly tranquil, empty, silent, yet alert <46> and aware, not dim. In activity, attending to matters, one is focused, single-minded, not divided, without the slightest error. Maintain personal bearing with composure and gravity; uphold the mind with caution and apprehension. This is the essence of abiding in reverence. Exerting effort lies in overcoming the self (克己, *kŭkki*) to cure the illnesses of one's temperament (*kijil*, 氣質). The soft are corrected to attain strength; the weak are corrected to attain resolve; the harsh are tempered with harmony; the hasty are tempered with leniency. If desires are many, clarify them until pure; if selfishness is abundant, rectify it until greatly impartial. Strive diligently, unceasingly day and night. This is the essence of exerting effort. Investigating principle is "extending knowledge through the investigation of things" (*kyŏngmul ch'iji*, 格物致知). Abiding in reverence and exerting effort are "making the will sincere, rectifying the mind, cultivating the person" (*sŏng'ŭi chŏngsim susin*, 誠意正心修身). When these three are cultivated together and advance side-by-side, then principle becomes clear and one acts without obstruction everywhere; inner uprightness takes form externally; the self is overcome, and one returns to one's original nature. The work of making the will sincere and rectifying the mind, nurtured within the self, shows on the face, fills the back, serves as a model for the family where brothers follow the example, extends to the state where transformation proceeds and customs become beautiful. Chu Hsi (朱子) said: "King Wen's (文王) work of rectifying the mind and making the will sincere permeated thoroughly, melted and spread, enveloping everything. The people of the southern states submitted to King Wen's transforming influence." How could Chu Hsi have imagined or speculated to arrive at this statement? He definitively knew that the work of sincerity and rectitude would surely spread throughout the state, hence he said so. I earnestly wish Your Majesty not to deem this too lofty and difficult to practice, nor to dismiss minor details as negligible. Always, in leisure, do not cease learning. The Four Books, the Five Classics, and the maxims of former worthies, the *Hsin Ching* (心經, Mind Classic), the *Chin-ssŭ Lu* (近思錄, Reflections on Things at Hand) – read these books cyclically, deeply investigating their meaning. Harbor no intention that is not the will of sages and worthies; read no book that is not the writing of sages and worthies. Carefully embody the "Nine Appearances" of the *Yü Tsao* (玉藻) chapter [of the *Li Chi*]. When a thought arises, examine whether it belongs to heavenly principle (天理, *ch'ŏlli*) or human desire (人欲, *inyok*). If human desire, cut it off before it takes form. If heavenly principle, skillfully promote and extend it. Restrain the wandering mind; overcome selfishness. Ensure robes and cap are proper; gaze is respectful; joy and anger are controlled; speech is compliant. Thus exhaust the work of sincerity and rectitude. What is meant by "discard partiality and bias, thereby expanding the measure of utmost impartiality"? The methods for correcting ailments were briefly presented earlier. However, the matter of partiality and bias (偏私, *p'yŏnsa*) is a common affliction throughout history, hence I mention it specifically. If even a trace of partiality remains, it is difficult to enter the Way of Yao and Sun. Now, Your Majesty possesses inherent clarity, and faults are certainly few. Yet, the thought of partiality has not been completely overcome. I fear you cannot share the greatness of Heaven and Earth. Regarding the recent incident where a eunuch presented a memorandum (*subon*, 手本), I was on leave outside the capital and did not learn the details. It seems it concerned placing the newborn prince under the Queen's registry. The Office of Royal Decrees (政院, *Chŏngwŏn*) requested a correction. If so, the designation should not be confused. Changing a few words is as easy as turning one's hand. Why did the eunuch not comply? Later, reading the royal message (*chŏn'gyo*, 傳敎), it said Your Majesty ordered not to change it and sent it directly [from the palace] to the Chŏngwŏn. This humble servant does not know the details, but since the Chŏngwŏn is named the "throat and tongue" [of the king], should not all matters, great or small, pass through it? Are the Inner Palace and the Outer Court two separate bodies? If it originated specifically from the sovereign's command, then even if a minor matter, it is a royal message; why call it a eunuch's memorandum? Since it was a eunuch's memorandum, should it not have gone through the Chŏngwŏn? Considering this calmly, the principle is self-evident. How could the Chŏngwŏn know it was a special command from the Sage's will and not fault the eunuch? Your Majesty could not remain calm and raised your voice greatly. This alienates the "throat and tongue" and favors eunuchs, fostering the gradual disregard for court officials. The royal message said: "Affairs of the time often go wrong because the ruler is not strict." Alas! Castrated underlings dare to defy the ministers of the "throat and tongue"; distant inner slaves dare to hope for undue favors; imperial relatives ride horses and encounter royal decrees without dismounting. Your Majesty's governance can indeed be called "not strict." Does Your Majesty perhaps blame yourself for this as well? During Emperor Wen of Han's (漢文帝) time, the Crown Prince passed the Sima Gate without dismounting his carriage, and the Commandant of Palace Guards (公車令) was able to impeach him. Teng T'ung (鄧通), being a favored subject, acted discourteously, and the Chancellor (丞相) summoned him by warrant, intending to execute him. Judging by common sentiment, disrespecting the Crown Prince, was that not slighting the ruler? Wanting to execute a favored subject, was that not usurping authority? Yet Emperor Wen did not lose the ruler's authority, and the effectiveness of his peaceful rule is certainly incomparable to today's. Now, Your Majesty is not close to the ministers but treats eunuchs as private attendants; does not value the common people but treats inner slaves as private folk. If this ailment is not cured, the affairs of the time cannot be rectified. I fear that the stricter Your Majesty becomes, the more things will go wrong. Emperor Wu of Han (漢武帝), improperly attired, hid behind a curtain when Chi An (汲黯) appeared. Emperor T'ai-tsung of T'ang (唐太宗), playing with a bird on his arm, hid it in his robe when Wei Chêng (魏徵) appeared. These two rulers, though their Way was not pure, their government orders were strict and clear, rewards and punishments were reliably administered, and imperial relatives and eunuchs dared not transgress the law – achievements unattainable today. Yet, why does a ruler fearing a minister seem like lack of strictness? This is not fearing the minister, but fearing righteousness (義, *ŭi*). To be strict yet <47> not fear righteousness – failure is inevitable. Does Your Majesty perhaps reflect on yourself and consider righteousness? Furthermore, regarding the matter recently contested by the Office of the Inspector General (憲府, *Hŏnbu*), although I do not know the full story, I suspect the Hŏnbu's investigation was incomplete. Why? Because Your Majesty, though not entirely free from personal bias, would surely not, regardless of right or wrong, contend with a commoner over a single slave (*chang'ok*, 臧獲). That the officials failed to consider this shows their wisdom was unclear. Nevertheless, since Your Majesty knew [the slave] should belong to the inner household yet still permitted joint ownership, this especially allows us to admire the breadth of the Sage's magnanimity. Persisting [in the dispute] for days, does it not make ministers and people suspect Your Majesty's personal stinginess remains unresolved? A ruler need not worry about not being strict, but worry about not being impartial (公, *kong*). Impartiality leads to clarity (明, *myŏng*), and clarity contains strictness within it. I earnestly wish Your Majesty to apply the law starting with the honored and close, extend benevolence to reach the masses, make the palace and government one body, not letting eunuchs rely on proximity to slight court officials, view all people equally, not letting inner slaves rely on private favor to peek at undue hopes. Entrust the inner treasury (內帑, *naet'ang*) to the relevant ministry, not treating it as private property. Eliminate biased thoughts from the mind. Let the measure of impartiality encompass and cover everything. If this is done, all treasuries are wealth; why worry about insufficient funds? All under heaven are subjects; why worry about lacking slaves? What is meant by "associate closely with worthy scholars, thereby benefiting from their enlightening counsel"? For a ruler's learning, nothing is better than being close to upright scholars. What one sees are all proper affairs; what one hears are all proper words. Even if the ruler wished not to be upright, could he succeed? If upright people are not close, and only eunuchs and palace ladies are near, then what is seen are not proper affairs, what is heard are not proper words. Even if the ruler wished to be upright, could he succeed? A former worthy said: "Heaven and Earth produce the people of one age, sufficient to manage the affairs of that age; one need not borrow talent from other eras." Worthies today are certainly hard to find. However, if we select exhaustively from the entire generation, regardless of whether they have passed the state examination or not, regardless of whether they are in or out of office, will there not be one or two who can assist the ruler? I earnestly wish Your Majesty to inquire broadly and select carefully, ensuring you find the right people. Those who have passed the examination should be gathered in the Office of Special Advisors (玉堂, *Oktang*) and not moved to other posts. Those who have not passed should be given sinecures along with a title related to the Royal Lectures. Those promoted to high rank should also, depending on their post, definitely hold a concurrent position in the Royal Lectures. Those participating in this selection should take turns attending daily, allowing them to fully express their thoughts. Your Majesty should empty yourself, wear a gentle expression, receive their loyal counsel. When discussing learning, thoroughly investigate principles; when discussing governance, seek practical results. Even on days without formal lectures, frequently summon them for informal audiences, only requiring the historian (*sagwan*, 史官) to attend. Question what is doubtful, reveal your profound thoughts. As for Royal Secretaries (*sŭngji*), by regulation, they should report in person on their respective official duties once a day. As for the words of ministers and the Censorate, they must enter for a personal audience without regard to time, restoring the practice of the ancestors. If this is done, the bond between ruler and ruled will grow closer daily, feelings will be unobstructed, discussions on nature and principle (*sŏngni*, 性理) will advance daily, sagacious learning will progress, rapport will be like fish in water, and deviant evils will not interfere with the heavenly brightness. These four points are the specifics of self-cultivation. The general outline is thus; the details depend on Your Majesty applying attention to knowing and acting. As for what is meant by "open the sincere heart, thereby understanding the feelings of those below," sagacious emperors and enlightened kings treated people and handled affairs entirely with utmost sincerity (至誠, *chisŏng*). Knowing someone to be a gentleman (*kunja*, 君子), they employed him without doubt. Knowing someone to be a petty man (*soin*, 小人), they dismissed him without hesitation. If doubtful, do not employ; if employed, do not doubt. Openly lead those below, straightforwardly and magnanimously. Ministers then look up [to the ruler] as to parents, trust him as the four seasons. If advanced, they fear not being able to fulfill their duties and increase their loyalty. If dismissed, they recognize their own fault and only blame themselves. Therefore, the way they gained the people's hearts was such that people would jump into boiling water, tread on white blades, establish a posthumous heir [for the ruler], leave their robes behind [at death] without disorder. They knew only their ruler and not themselves. There is no other reason than being moved by utmost sincerity. Rulers of later times lacked sincere intent, merely managing those below with intellect and force. Those they employed were not necessarily worthy, chosen because they suited the ruler. Those they dismissed were not necessarily unworthy, disliked because they differed from the ruler. Even if suited to the ruler, their inner character could not be trusted, so employing them, one could not be without doubt; doubting them, one could not but employ them. When a great minister holds power and fulfills his duties, popular sentiment inevitably esteems him highly; how can the ruler not suspect him of monopolizing power and dominating governance? When remonstrating officials offer sharp criticism in court, court and country inevitably focus attention on them; how can the ruler not suspect them of selling straightforwardness to gain fame? Gentlemen and petty men associate with their own kind; how does one know who forms factions? Good policies and evil proposals are presented together confusedly; how does one know which will harm the state? Thus, right and wrong become hard to distinguish, yes and no hard to discern. Following convention, one worries about decline; initiating reforms, one dislikes disturbance. When the ruler's mind wavers, unsettled and unhappy, great villains inevitably lurk, exploiting gaps, conforming to the ruler's inclinations, gradually applying their cunning, infiltrating through ingratiation, pleasing through flattery, alarming through intimidation. <48> Once the ruler's mind gradually trusts them and falls into their trap, the good and virtuous will surely be eliminated, and the state will surely be lost. This also has no other cause than the lack of sincerity. Now, Your Majesty's love of goodness and affection for scholars certainly stem from sincerity, but simply because the officials lack sufficient talent and virtue to be relied upon, there seems to be no intention to fully entrust them. Even when speaking, expressions of distrust and slighting remarks cannot be avoided. The officials certainly bring this upon themselves, yet the sagacious ruler must also reflect. I hope Your Majesty will strive to treat those below with utmost sincerity. If something is right, say it is right; if the heart deems it wrong, speak out against it. If promoting someone, be sure to reward their worthiness; if dismissing someone, be sure to enumerate their faults. Let the sagacious heart be wide open like a gate, allowing all below to look up and see without the slightest obstruction. If this is done, officials will have no thoughts of doubt or fear, striving to exhaust their feelings. Gentlemen will desire to offer loyalty, and petty men will lose the chance to sell their treachery. What is meant by "revise the tribute register (*kongan*), thereby eliminating the harm of rapacious levies"? During the reigns of the ancestors, expenditures were very modest, and exactions from the people very light. During Yŏnsan'gun's middle years, expenditures became extravagant. Regular tribute was insufficient to meet his needs, so additions were set to satisfy his desires. I heard this from elders in the past but dared not fully believe it. Previously, while in the Chŏngwŏn, I examined the Hojo's (戶曹, Ministry of Taxation) tribute register. Indeed, various tribute items were all additions set in the Sinyu year of the Hung-chih era (弘治辛酉) [1501], and are still followed today. Checking the time, this was indeed the reign of Yŏnsan'gun. I could not help but close the register and sigh deeply, saying: "So it is!" From Hung-chih Sinyu to the present is seventy-four years. Sagacious rulers have reigned, worthy scholars have stood in court; why has this law not been reformed? Investigating the reason, throughout these seventy years, powerful villains held sway. Although two or three gentlemen occasionally stood in court, their ambitions could not be realized, and strange calamities inevitably followed. How could they have had the leisure to discuss this? It must have awaited today! Furthermore, local products change with time, and population and taxable land fluctuate, yet the allocation of tribute items was set in the early days of the dynasty. The Yŏnsan era merely added onto this; it was not an adjustment based on suitability. Now, many items demanded from districts are not produced there. It is like seeking fish by climbing a tree or catching animals by boat. They inevitably have to trade with other districts or buy in the capital. The people's expense is multiplied a hundredfold, yet public coffers are not filled. Additionally, households gradually shrink, fields become increasingly barren. What was paid by a hundred people in former years was demanded from ten people the year before last. What was paid by ten people the year before last is demanded from one person this year. The situation will inevitably reach the point where that one person is also exhausted, and only then will it stop. Now, when the revision of the tribute register is mentioned, commentators invariably defer, saying the laws of the ancestors cannot be lightly changed. Even if it were the law of the ancestors, with the people's destitution reaching this point, it must be changed. How much more so the laws of Yŏnsan'gun! I hope Your Majesty will select individuals with wisdom sufficient to understand affairs, with calculation skills sufficient to make estimates, with talent sufficient to manage tasks. Entrust this matter solely to them, led by a high minister. Completely abolish the additions made by Yŏnsan'gun, returning to the old ways of the ancestors. Then, investigate the presence or absence of products, the amount of taxable land, the population size (declining or flourishing) in each district. Adjust and determine allocations equitably. If tribute must be paid in kind (*ponsaek*, 本色) to the respective offices, then *pangnap* will cease naturally without being banned, and the people's livelihood will be relieved as if rescued from being hung upside down. Among today's urgent tasks, none is greater than this. What is meant by "promote frugality, thereby reforming the custom of extravagance"? The people's poverty and depleted finances have reached an extreme today. Tribute must be reduced, but if expenditures do not follow the model of the ancestors, income cannot match outflow – fitting a round lid on a square container is logically impossible. Moreover, the extravagance of customs is worse today than ever before. Food is not for filling the stomach but for displaying overflowing tables to boast. Clothing is not for covering the body but for competing in ostentatious finery. The cost of one banquet could feed the hungry for several months; the cost of one garment could clothe ten shivering people. Ten people plow the fields, yet it is not enough to feed one person, as cultivators are few and eaters many. Ten people weave cloth, yet it is not enough to clothe one person, as weavers are few and wearers many. How can the people not be hungry and cold? The ancients said: "The harm of extravagance is worse than natural disaster." How true! If Your Majesty does not first prioritize frugality to remedy this affliction, then even if laws are strict and orders diligent, it will be futile labor without benefit. I recall hearing elders say: When King Sŏngjong was ill in bed, ministers entered to inquire. The quilt covering him in the bedchamber was made of coarse brown wool, worn out but unchanged. Those who hear this even today feel admiration. I earnestly wish Your Majesty to order an examination of the regulations for palace provisions during the ancestors' reigns. Palace expenditures should entirely follow the frugal system of the ancestors. Set an example for the capital and provinces to reform the extravagant habits among the people. Make people ashamed to serve lavish feasts, ashamed to wear fine clothes, thereby cherishing Heaven's resources and relieving the people's strength. What is meant by "change the *sŏn'up* system, thereby relieving the suffering of public slaves (*kongch'ŏn*)"? The original intent <49> of *sŏn'up* was not to collect cotton cloth. Because the capital lacked sufficient government slaves (*chŏnbok*) for labor duties, public slaves from outside the capital were rotated for capital service (*kyŏng'yŏk*), called *sŏn'up*. Poor and destitute public slaves, carrying their own provisions and staying for long periods, suffered extreme hardship and found it unbearable. They began substituting cotton cloth for service (*sang'yŏk*). Now, only cotton cloth is collected; not a single person comes for service. The people's livelihood worsens daily, households decline daily. Public slaves are also people; how can they alone remain intact? They wander and become displaced, unable to make a living. Paying the *sŏn'up* levy once is enough to ruin most families. Paying tribute for two years and *sŏn'up* for one year generally means ruin once every three years. The suffering of public slaves is extreme. Additionally, the clerks (*saek吏*, *saek'i*) of the relevant ministry (*haego*, 該曹) distribute the burden unevenly. Even in districts with many slaves, if bribed, the quota is reduced. Even in districts with only a few households, if not bribed, the quota is increased. Unable to bear the burden, it encroaches upon the entire clan (*ilchok*). Commoners (*chaemin*) also suffer. Once impoverished, even fair and equal allocation cannot save them. If not reformed, future troubles will be endless. This humble servant believes that changing personal service (*sin'yŏk*) to receiving cotton cloth already deviates from the *Kyŏngguk taejŏn*. Thus, today we can also abolish *sŏn'up* and add a personal tribute (*sin'gong*). I hope Your Majesty will order the relevant officials to carefully examine the slave registers. Based on the currently existing numbers, levy an annual tribute of two *p'il* (疋, bolts) of cotton cloth per male slave (*no*) and one and a half *p'il* per female slave (*pi*). Calculate the total amount. Store two-fifths of it in the Supply Office (司贍, *Sach'ŏm*) for state use. Give three-fifths to the various offices to cover the *sŏn'up* labor equivalent. If the cotton cloth is insufficient, reduce the number of required laborers accordingly. If this is done, public slaves will have a fixed tribute they can prepare for, avoiding the hardship of sudden demands. Tribute collection will have fixed registers, preventing alteration and eliminating the techniques of corrupt clerks. Without troublesome orders, the people receive real benefits. What is meant by "reform military administration, thereby solidifying defenses within and without"? Celestial changes are hard to predict, and one certainly cannot pinpoint their cause to a specific event. However, examining ancient histories, a white rainbow piercing the sun often portends military affairs. Currently, military administration has collapsed, the four borders lack defenses. If an emergency arises, even with the strategic wisdom of Liang [Zhang Liang] and P'ing [Chen Ping], or the command of Ch'i [Han Xin] and Hsin [Li Jing], without soldiers to lead, how can one fight alone? Thinking of this chills the heart and makes the gallbladder tremble. The current problems were presented earlier, but military administration was not detailed. Now, may I first present its flaws and then propose solutions? Our country's legal system has many deficiencies. Only offices like Army Commander (*pyŏngsa*, 兵使), Navy Commander (*susa*, 水使), *Ch'ŏmsa* (僉使), *Manho* (萬戶), *Kwŏn'gwan* (權管) are established, but without means for their support, forcing them to provide for themselves from the soldiers. The abuse of border commanders exploiting soldiers originates here. As the legal system gradually weakened, greed and tyranny grew worse. Compounded by unfair appointments, debt-ridden commanders (*chaesa*, 債師) followed one after another. It is openly said: "The post of commander in such-and-such garrison is worth this much; the office in such-and-such fort costs that much." These types only know how to strip the soldiers bare to enrich themselves; what else do they care about? Soldiers suffering from garrison duty (*yubang*) who wish to pay cotton cloth to avoid service (*myŏnsuyŏk*) are readily accepted. Those remaining in the garrison are burdened with unbearable tasks and demands for hard-to-procure supplies, making them suffer as if in searing fire. People are not wood or stone; who does not cherish their own body? Seeing those exempted from service resting comfortably at home, everyone feels envy and follows suit. If many avoid service and garrisons become empty, nearby residents are enticed to substitute their names during inspections (*ch'ŏkkan*, 擲姦). Inspecting officials (*sun'an chi kwan*) merely check the numbers; who asks if they are genuine? Although exemption from service is convenient, cotton cloth is hard to procure. Thus, after several tours of duty, families are already destitute, unable to support themselves. Desertions follow one after another. The next year, when registers are checked and duty enforced, the home district inevitably makes the entire clan responsible. When that clan flees, it encroaches upon another clan's clan. Calamity spreads like vines, without limit, reaching the point where no commoners remain. Meanwhile, the so-called debt-ridden commanders, content and satisfied, return home laden with goods, boasting to their wives and concubines. The poor become rich, bribe powerful factions, seek further promotion, and the lowly become noble. Current commentators do not think of correcting this abuse but merely worry about the military roster (*kun'aek*) being unfilled. This humble servant believes that even if the roster were full, if this abuse is not reformed, it will only increase the amount of cotton cloth obtained by border commanders. What contribution does it make to defense? This is the first abuse. Land and naval soldiers are not necessarily stationed where they live. Some are sent journeys of several days, some journeys of a thousand *li*. Many suffer illness due to unfamiliar climate and water. Already fearful of the commander's exploitation, they also suffer bullying by local soldiers (*t'obyŏng*). As travelers (*kyŏryŏ*), they face cold, hardship, hunger, irregular meals. Southern soldiers garrisoning the northern border suffer particularly, emaciated, wishing for death, faces devoid of color. If such troops encountered enemy cavalry, they could not even flee effectively and would sit waiting to be slaughtered like fish. How could one expect them to draw bows and resist the enemy? I hear that Hwanghae (黃海) cavalry garrisoning P'yŏngan (平安) province incur expenses of no less than thirty to forty *p'il* of cotton cloth per trip. <50> Thirty to forty *p'il* is the wealth of several village households! One trip ruins several households; how can they not become poor and flee? This is the second abuse. The law requiring registration (*sŏngjŏk*) every six years has lapsed and is not practiced. In the Kyech'uk year (癸丑, 1553?), a roundup (*sogwal*) occurred after long neglect. Officials dispatched, aiming for strict and efficient execution, acted hastily. Districts and counties, following the trend, feared omission more than the harm of false inclusion. Destitute beggars (*hyung'gŏl chi in*) lacking means were counted; names of dogs difficult to distinguish were also recorded. Within a year or two, the majority became empty entries. Now, after more than twenty years, another major registration is undertaken. The shortage in the military roster is worse than Kyech'uk; able-bodied men (*hanjŏng*) are also scarcer than Kyech'uk. However skillful the roundup, how can flour (*koyu*) be made without grain (*mu*)? Those currently being registered are either children (*tongch'i*) or beggars; if not beggars, then members of the scholar class (*sajok*). How many are actual able-bodied men (*chŏng*, 丁)? Even if registered now, the roster will soon become empty again. The relevant ministry (*haego*) is not unaware, yet they drone on about needing to fill the quota. Their disregard for reality is extreme. This is the third abuse. Various types of public service (*yang'yŏk*) in the capital and provinces are numerous beyond counting. Among them, those called *Chorye* (皂隷), *Najang* (羅將), etc., are the most arduous duties. These too are now compensated with cotton cloth. The offices to which they belong (*sok chi sa*) hire substitutes (*t'ain*) but still periodically press the assigned individuals (*tŭi吏*, *che'i*) to pay the commutation debt (*sang'yŏkchae*). The *che'i* pay interest to remit the debt, and calculating the total cost, collect triple the amount from the assigned person. Thus, one person effectively bears the burden of three. Unable to sustain this, the obligation typically falls on the entire clan. This is the fourth abuse. If these four abuses are not remedied now, after several years, even a capable person could do nothing. I hope Your Majesty will reorganize the old system and establish new regulations. For all army and navy bases (*pyŏngsuyŏng*) and garrison forts (*chinbo*), allocate sufficient grain from outside the official registers of that locality to generously provide for the border commanders' sustenance. If the local grain is insufficient, collect grain from neighboring districts. Ensure border commanders have the means to support themselves without lack. Then, strictly enforce regulations: not a foot of cloth, not a measure of rice may be extorted from the soldiers. Only require them to refine weapons, practice archery and horsemanship. When Army/Navy Commanders or inspecting officials visit, they should not merely call names and check rosters but carefully inspect equipment, test archery and horsemanship, observe training proficiency to determine performance ratings. If, as before, they extort goods or release soldiers and are discovered, punish them under the laws for bribery (*changnyul*). For officials like *Ch'ŏmsa*, *Manho*, *Kwŏn'gwan*, regardless of north or south, near or far, assign them military posts (*kunjik*) allowing their wives and children to receive stipends for support. At the initial appointment, select the person carefully. After appointment, after five performance reviews (*ko*) and five promotions (*sang*), promote from *Kwŏn'gwan* to *Manho*, from *Manho* to *Ch'ŏmsa*, then grant a sixth-rank position in the Eastern Band (*tongban*). Within the five reviews, if performance is average, transfer laterally to another garrison without promotion. Make them cherish their prospects and feel encouraged. As for garrison duty, soldiers must be led from their home district. If local soldiers are insufficient, then assign from neighboring districts. In the garrison location, abolish all other local public service duties, retaining only garrison duty. Eliminate the hardship of distant travel. Divide into shifts for rotation and rest. While in the garrison, there should be no burden whatsoever that exhausts strength or wastes wealth. Service rendered to the commander should involve nothing more than carrying firewood and water. Let them focus entirely on practicing archery and marksmanship. As for Hwanghae cavalry serving in the north, order this discontinued. If border defenses are feared weakened, order border magistrates to teach the people archery. Hold competitions every three months. Reward generously those with high scores. Those who rank first twice should have their household service obligations exempted. If someone ranks first five times, if a soldier, specially appoint him as a military officer (*kun'gwan*). Select among them those with knowledge capable of leading troops, report their names to the relevant ministry, and have them appointed as *Kwŏn'gwan* to test their usability. If a public or private slave, report their name and grant special exemption from base status (*myŏnch'ŏn*). If a private slave, provide fair compensation (*kikka*, 價) to the owner. If this is done, those ranking first five times will be exceedingly rare, yet the border populace will all transform into elite soldiers. If a border emergency occurs, people will defend themselves; who would not fight hard? For soldiers on active duty (*sangbŏn chi kun*), the authorities should also periodically test their martial skills. Report the best performers for rewards. If one ranks first five times, specially appoint them as a military officer in a nearby garrison, fostering the will to train. Regarding military registration, strive to get real soldiers, not just fill quotas. For able-bodied men (*hanjŏng*) under fifteen, just record their name and age in a separate register (*pyŏlbok*), having them wait until of age to be enrolled. Mercenaries (*yongsig*) and destitute beggars should be entirely struck off. District military registers should provisionally retain the old quota, but record how many are unfilled. Order magistrates to nurture the population, tirelessly providing relief. As men become available, enroll them, without time limit, aiming for full strength. Furthermore, revise the registers (*kaejŏk*) every six years as per regulation, avoiding sudden <51> disturbances. If fearing insufficient soldiers for various duties, reduce the number of active duty soldiers. If still insufficient, reduce the number at defensive points (*pang'ŏk*). If still insufficient, reduce the number of southern soldiers on winter garrison duty. If still insufficient, commute half the payment (*kap*, 價) for infantry (*pobyŏng*) who pay cloth, using them to supplement garrison shortfalls. Once garrison duty is free from exploitative harm, even infantrymen will not avoid it like fleeing tigers. As for those called *Chorye*, *Najang*, etc., abolish these titles rather than assigning them to specific offices. Convert them all to infantry paying cloth (*napkajŏnpobyŏng*) to the Ministry of War (*Pyŏngjo*). The Ministry of War will then allocate the cloth payment according to the labor needs of each office. This will free the *che'i* from periodic extortion and relieve the populace from the burden of triple payment. This is the general outline of good military policy. These five points are the specifics for pacifying the people. The general outline is thus; the details depend on Your Majesty seeking broad counsel and planning. Looking at the current affairs, they deteriorate daily. The strength of the people's livelihood diminishes daily, almost worse than during the times when powerful villains held sway. Why is this? During the time of powerful villains, the inherited grace of the ancestors was not yet exhausted. Though court governance was chaotic, the people's strength could still endure. Today, the ancestors' grace is exhausted, and the poisons left by the villains have fully manifested. Though pure discussion proceeds, the people's strength is already depleted. It is like a person who in youth indulged in wine and women, causing much harm, but whose strong constitution prevented injury from showing. In old age, the poisons of that harm erupt with the decline, and though careful recuperation is attempted, the vital energy (*wŏn'gi*) is already ruined beyond recovery. Today's situation is truly like this. Within ten years, disaster and chaos will surely arise. A common man inheriting a ten-room house and a hundred *mu* field from his ancestors still thinks of managing it well so as not to disgrace them. How much more so Your Majesty, having received the hundred-year state altars and thousand-*li* territory from the ancestors, yet facing impending disaster and chaos? If the heart sincerely seeks it, though hitting the mark may be difficult, one can still save oneself through effort, even if strength is insufficient. How much more so Your Majesty, holding supreme power, clearly perceiving matters, possessing the strength to rescue the times? This humble servant has received the state's profound grace, unrepayable even with a hundred deaths. If it benefits the state, I would not avoid cauldrons or axes. How much more so now, when Your Majesty has opened wide the path for speech, tolerating criticism without offense? Under your handwritten instruction, the words were earnest and compassionate. If I did not speak, I would truly betray Your Majesty. Driven by sincere feelings, I have spoken my utmost, exhausting my arguments. Yet, due to illness, my mind is confused, my hand trembles, the language is rustic and repetitive, the characters barely formed, unworthy of view. However, its intent seems distant but is actually near; its policies seem circuitous but are truly fundamental. Though not the system of the Three Dynasties, it is truly the foundation of kingly governance. If implemented effectively, kingly governance can be restored. I hope Your Majesty will carefully read, calmly peruse, deeply contemplate. Once a decision is reached in the sagacious mind, then consult broadly with court officials, discuss feasibility, and proceed. It would be most fortunate if Your Majesty adopts my proposals, entrusts them to capable hands, implements them with sincerity, guards them with firm resolve. Do not be swayed by the conventional views of the vulgar clinging to norms; do not be shaken by the tongues of slanderers who hate the upright. If after three years of doing so, the state is not revitalized, the people not pacified, the military not strengthened, then I ask to be punished for the crime of deception, as a warning to those who spread alarming words. I am overcome with intense emotion and trepidation.

II. Tap Sŏng Howŏn sŏ (Reply to Sŏng Hon's Original Letter)

How were the clear conditions last night? Yesterday, receiving your reply, I understood your elegant points fully. I hope we can reach agreement, which would be most fortunate. How about I send back the long letter discussing *li* (理, principle) and *ki* (氣, material force/ether) separately for detailed review? Your letter states that *ki* involves form and trace, differing from *li*. This is indeed the main point, but within it are many subtleties. One must investigate them thoroughly to the very end to be said to have grasped the meaning. The explanation in the long letter is quite detailed. I (珥, Yi I's personal name) originally intended to hold back this one turn of phrase and wait for you, my elder brother [Sŏng Hon], to elaborate yourself. But now, pressed by your thorough questioning, if I do not speak to the utmost point and exhaust the origin, there will ultimately be no chance for agreement. Thus, I again empty my quiver of all I possess. This is all the meaning of the sages and worthies. It is perhaps scattered throughout the classics and commentaries but not spoken of collectively. So, I now combine and explain it. The four characters "principle permeates, *ki* is localized" (理通氣局, *i t'ong ki kuk*) – I believe I have understood this, yet I also fear, having read few books, that such words already exist and I have not seen them. Considering the "mind of the Way" (*tosim*, 道心) as the original *ki* (本然之氣, *ponhyŏn chi ki*) also seems like a new expression. Although it is the meaning of the sages and worthies, it has not appeared in writing. If my brother does not doubt or reject these words, then there is nothing that doesn't fit. Also, thank you immensely for lending your strength yesterday, enabling the transport of timber for the small pavilion. Yesterday, I received a letter from Kyeham [Yi I's younger brother] containing a message for my child, urging quick delivery, hence I send this boy servant. Kyeham's letter mentions that the slander against me has recently become even worse, suggesting a net of crime might be cast. My body is already entrusted to fate; rat's liver or insect's arm [worthless things, from Chuang Tzu], I will let be what may. But thinking carefully, my so-called actions involve no particular animosity towards others. Only <52> the matter of not serving in office makes my conduct differ from the common. To hate someone like an enemy merely because they differ – the ways of the world can be called perilous! Since ancient times, I have never heard of someone being punished for not serving in office. If it starts with me, it is also a laughable matter in these degenerate times. Currently, the state faces important matters, yet I am not fulfilling my duties and instead planning a long journey. This is improper according to righteousness. Therefore, I have stopped the journey to the southeast and intend to send someone to my younger brother's place to offer respects at T'oegye (*T'oegye*, 退溪) [Yi Hwang] sensei's tomb. How should my brother send offerings? Yesterday, I heard Saam [Pak Sun] was appointed Right State Councilor. Recent court reports seem quite satisfactory to public opinion. I wonder if it will indeed yield results.

*Li* and *ki* are originally inseparable, seeming like one thing, yet how they differ is: *li* is formless (*hyŏng*, 形); *ki* has form. *Li* is inactive (*muwi*, 無爲); *ki* is active (*yuwi*, 有爲). That which is formless and inactive, yet serves as the master (*chu*, 主) of the formed and active, is *li*. That which has form and is active, yet serves as the vessel (*ki*, 器) of the formless and inactive, is *ki*. Because *li* is formless and *ki* has form, *li* permeates (*t'ong*, 通) and *ki* is localized (*kuk*, 局). Because *li* is inactive and *ki* is active, *ki* issues forth (*pal*, 發) and *li* rides (*sŭng*, 乘) upon it. What does "*li* permeates" mean? *Li* has no beginning or end, no before or after. Having no beginning/end or before/after, it is not the case that before response it is "before," and after response it is "after." Master Ch'ĕng explained this. Therefore, riding on the flow of *ki*, it becomes differentiated and uneven, yet its original subtlety (本然之妙, *ponhyŏn chi myo*) is present everywhere. When *ki* is partial, *li* is also partial, but what is partial is not *li*, but *ki*. When *ki* is whole, *li* is also whole, but what is whole is not *li*, but *ki*. Even within the clear and turbid, pure and mixed, dregs and ashes, filth and decay, *li* is present everywhere, constituting the nature (*sŏng*, 性) of each thing, while its original subtlety is not harmed and remains as it is. This is called the permeation of *li*. What does "*ki* is localized" mean? Since *ki* already involves form and trace, it has beginning and end, before and after. The origin of *ki* is nothing but profound unity, clear and void. How could there originally be the *ki* of dregs, ashes, filth, and decay? Only because it ascends, descends, flies, soars, never ceasing, it becomes differentiated and uneven, and the myriad transformations arise. Thus, in the flow of *ki*, there are instances where its originality is not lost, and instances where its originality is lost. Once its originality is lost, the original *ki* is no longer present. Partial *ki* is partial *ki*, not whole *ki*. Clear *ki* is clear *ki*, not turbid *ki*. The *ki* of dregs and ashes is the *ki* of dregs and ashes, not the *ki* of profound unity and clear void. It is not like *li*, whose original subtlety is present in all things. This is called the localization of *ki*. What does "*ki* issues forth and *li* rides upon it" mean? Yin is tranquil, Yang is active – the activating force (*ki*, 機) is simply thus; there is nothing that causes it. When Yang moves, *li* rides upon the movement; it is not *li* that moves. When Yin is still, *li* rides upon the stillness; it is not *li* that is still. Therefore, Chu Hsi said: "The Great Ultimate (*T'aegŭk*, 太極) is the original subtlety. Activity and stillness are the activating force it rides upon." Yin is tranquil, Yang is active – their activating force is simply thus. Yet, the reason why Yin is tranquil and Yang is active is *li*. Therefore, Chou Tun-i (周子, Chuja) said: "The Great Ultimate moves and generates Yang; is still and generates Yin." When he speaks of "moves and generates Yang, is still and generates Yin," he speaks tracing back to the state before manifestation (*miran*). When [Chu Hsi] speaks of "activity and stillness are the activating force it rides upon," he speaks seeing the state after manifestation (*iran*). Activity and stillness have no beginning; Yin and Yang have no origin. Thus, the flow of *li* and *ki* is entirely already manifest; how could there be a time before manifestation? Therefore, in the transformations of Heaven and Earth, and the arising of our minds, there is nothing that is not *ki* issuing forth and *li* riding upon it. When we say "*ki* issues forth and *li* rides upon it," it is not that *ki* precedes *li*. Since *ki* is active and *li* is inactive, the wording cannot be otherwise. Above *li*, not a single word can be added, not a trace of effortful action (*suwi*, 修爲). *Li* is originally good; how can it be cultivated? The thousand words and ten thousand sayings of the sages and worthies only aim to teach people to control their *ki* so it returns to its original state. The original state of *ki* is the vast, flowing *qi* (浩然之氣, *hoyŏn chi ki*). When the vast, flowing *qi* fills Heaven and Earth, then the originally good *li* is not the least bit obscured. This is why Mencius's theory of nourishing *ki* was meritorious for the Confucian school. If it were not the single path of "*ki* issues forth and *li* rides upon it," and *li* also had separate activity, then *li* could not be called inactive. Why did Confucius say: "Man can broaden the Way; it is not the Way that broadens man"? If one sees through this, then the single path of "*ki* issues forth and *li* rides upon it" becomes clear and straightforward. Then, the sayings "originate from" (*wŏn*, 原) or "arise from" (*saeng*, 生), "man trusts the horse's legs," "horse follows man's intention" can also be connected laterally, each reaching its conclusion. Please try to ponder this carefully and deeply. Do not dismiss the words lightly just because the person [myself] is shallow.

The theory of the single path of "*ki* issues forth and *li* rides upon it" and the sayings "originate from" or "arise from," "man trusts the horse's legs," "horse follows man's intention" can all be coherently connected. My elder brother has not yet penetrated this point, hence you still cannot completely abandon T'oegye's theory of "mutual issuance" (*hobal*, 互發) of *li* and *ki*, internal emergence (*naech'ul*) and external stimulus (*oegam*), the prior existence of two meanings, and instead wish to draw upon T'oegye's theory to align with my (珥) theory. The discussion in the separate sheet is quite detailed, yet I still fear my brother cannot achieve clear and complete resolution. The theory of the single path of "*ki* issues forth and *li* rides upon it" is a discussion tracing back to the root. The sayings "originate from" or "arise from," "man trusts the horse's legs," "horse follows man's intention" are discussions following the flow. Now, my brother says: "Before issuance (*mibal*), there are no separate sprouts of *li* and *ki* activity." This aligns with my humble view. But to say, "Between nature (*sŏng*, 性) and feelings (*chŏng*, 情), there originally exist two things, *li* and *ki*, each coming out separately"—this is not just a slip of the tongue, but truly an error in perception. Again, you say: "Focusing on one path, speak of what is primary." This again aligns with my humble view. Within one letter, sometimes agreeing, sometimes diverging—although this shows perception is not precise, it also indicates doubt mixed with belief, and the potential for awakening. Now, if you understand that "*ki* issues forth and *li* rides upon it" and "man <53> trusts the horse's legs," "horse follows man's intention" roll together into one theory, then we reach the same conclusion. Why still doubt? The Mind of the Way (*tosim*, 道心) originates from nature and destiny (*sŏngmyŏng*) and issues forth—this issuance is *ki*. Thus, to call it *li*'s issuance is incorrect. Both the human mind (*insim*, 人心) and the Mind of the Way are issuances of *ki*. When *ki* conforms to original principle (*ponhyŏn chi ri*), then *ki* is also original *ki*. Therefore, *li* rides upon this original *ki* to become the Mind of the Way. When *ki* deviates from original principle, it also deviates from original *ki*. Therefore, *li* also rides upon this altered *ki* to become the human mind, which either exceeds or falls short. Sometimes, at the very beginning of issuance, the Mind of the Way already exercises control, preventing excess or deficiency. Sometimes, after excess or deficiency occurs, the Mind of the Way also exercises control, guiding it toward the mean (*chung*, 中). When *ki* conforms to original principle, it is certainly *ki* issuing forth, but *ki* obeys the command of *li*. Therefore, emphasis is placed on *li*, and one speaks prioritizing *li*. When *ki* deviates from original principle, it certainly originates from *li*, but since it is not the original *ki*, it cannot be said to obey the command of *li*. Therefore, emphasis is placed on *ki*, and one speaks prioritizing *ki*. Whether *ki* obeys or not is all determined by *ki*. *Li*, however, is inactive; it cannot be said to have mutual issuance or activity. However, in the sage, whose form and *ki* entirely obey *li*, the human mind is also the Mind of the Way. This should be discussed separately and not rolled into one explanation. Furthermore, Chu Hsi said: "The empty-灵知觉 (virtual, numinous, knowing, perceiving) quality of the mind (*sim*, 心) is one." Whether it "originates from the correctness of nature and destiny" (*wŏn'ŏ sŏngmyŏng chi chŏng*) or "arises from the selfishness of physical form and *ki*" (*saeng'ŏ hyŏnggi chi sa*), the word "mind" (*sim*) is placed first. Thus, the mind is *ki*. Since "originating from" and "arising from" are both issuances of the mind, is this not *ki* issuing forth? The *li* contained within the mind is nature (*sŏng*). There is no instance where the mind exists but nature does not issue forth. Is this not *li* riding upon it? "Originates from" speaks prioritizing *li*. "Arises from" speaks prioritizing *ki*. It is not that there were initially two sprouts, *li* and *ki*. Explaining requires such wording, but whether scholars misunderstand or not was not something Chu Hsi anticipated. Viewed this way, do the theories of "*ki* issues forth and *li* rides upon it" and "originates from/arises from" truly contradict each other? If after such explanation, we still do not agree, I fear we will ultimately never agree. As for T'oegye's two words "mutual issuance" (*hobal*), it seems not a slip of phrasing; I fear he could not deeply perceive the subtlety of *li* and *ki* being inseparable. Also, the distinction between internal emergence (*naech'ul*) and external stimulus (*oegam*) differs greatly from my humble view, yet my elder brother wishes to draw upon it for support. This not only fails to grasp my meaning but also fails to clearly see T'oegye's meaning. T'oegye considered internal emergence as the Mind of the Way and external stimulus as the human mind. I (珥), however, believe both human mind and Mind of the Way emerge internally, and their activation (*tong*) is always due to external stimulus. Are these truly compatible and supportive? You must re-examine T'oegye's original discussion and my previous letters to seek their meanings. Statements like "Nature and feelings originally have no principle of mutual issuance of *li* and *ki*," "Whenever nature issues forth as feelings, it is just *ki* issuing forth and *li* riding upon it," etc., are not fabrications by me (珥) but the meaning of earlier Confucians. They just did not explain it in detail, and I merely elaborated upon their intent. Establishing [principles for] Heaven and Earth without contradiction, awaiting later sages without doubt—I am resolutely certain. Where is the evidence that this is the meaning of earlier Confucians? Did Chu Hsi not say: "The nature of material force (*kijil chi sŏng*) is just *this* nature (*ch'a sŏng*, 此性)." "*This* nature" refers to the original nature (*ponhyŏn chi sŏng*). Because it falls into the midst of material force (*kijil*), it follows the material force and becomes a distinct nature of its own (*chajak ilsŏng*). "*This* nature" [in the second instance] refers to the nature of material force. Master Ch'ĕng said: "Nature is *ki*, *ki* is nature; this refers to life (*saeng*)." Viewed this way, the nature of material force and the original nature are decidedly not two natures. It is just that, focusing on the material force aspect, one singly points to the *li* within and calls it original nature; combining *li* and *ki*, one designates it the nature of material force. Since nature is one, how can feelings have two sources? Only if there were two natures could there be two kinds of feelings. If T'oegye's theory were followed, then the original nature is in the East, the nature of material force is in the West. What emerges from the East is called the Mind of the Way; what emerges from the West is called the human mind. Is this principle? If one says nature is one, then does it mean what emerges from nature is the Mind of the Way, and what emerges spontaneously without nature is the human mind? Is this principle either? If words are not appropriate, affairs cannot be accomplished. I hope you will reconsider this point repeatedly.

Regarding the diagrams (*tosŏl*) mentioned the other day, I did not mean to expand upon what former sages had not revealed. The diagrams and statements like "originating in benevolence (*in*, 仁) yet harming benevolence" are indeed the meaning of former worthies, but there were no explicit statements. Shallow observers will inevitably suspect this deviates from the former worthies' theories, hence my previous comments. Please do not let the wording obscure the meaning.

Addendum: We had planned to include in this issue Master Yulgok's *Kapmu Man'ŏn pongsa* (甲戍萬言封事), *Imo Chinsipye So* (壬午陳時弊䟽), *Kyemi Yukchoŭi* (癸未六條議), nine letters from the *Im Kap Tap Sŏng Howŏn sŏ* (壬甲答成浩原書九篇), and *Kisa Tongho Mundap* (己巳東湖問答). However, due to page limitations, printing issues, and various circumstances, we regretfully could not publish everything as planned. We intend to publish the remainder at the next opportunity. <54>

**Summary**

This article presents excerpts from the writings of the prominent 16th-century Korean Neo-Confucian scholar Yi I (Yulgok). It primarily features his *Man'ŏn pongsa*, a memorial to King Sŏnjo detailing severe problems in governance—lack of timely reform, corruption, breakdown of discipline, public suffering, detachment between ruler and officials—and proposing concrete solutions focused on practical results, sincerity, frugality, and military reform. It also includes part of his philosophical correspondence with Sŏng Hon (*Tap Sŏng Howŏn sŏ*), delving into the complex relationship between principle (*li*) and material force (*ki*), arguing for the view that *ki* issues forth and *li* rides upon it (*ki pal i sŭng chi ilto*). For historians of the colonial period, the choice to publish Yulgok's sharp critique of government failure and his urgent call for systemic reform in 1921 is noteworthy. It might reflect a subtle way to discuss contemporary issues of maladministration and the need for change under Japanese rule by invoking a revered historical figure known for his statecraft and integrity.
