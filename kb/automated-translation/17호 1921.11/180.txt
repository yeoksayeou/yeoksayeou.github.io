Deep Fulfillment
						Yukdang Ch'oe Nam-sŏn

It is still fresh in the public's memory that Mr. Yuktang Ch'oe Nam-sŏn, who drafted the Korean Declaration of Independence (朝鮮獨立宣言書) and was abruptly imprisoned (囹圄), unexpectedly exited the Kongdŏk-ri Prison gate (孔德里 監獄門) on October 18th in the form of provisional release (假出獄). While imprisoned, aside from the prescribed labor (定規의 役), Mr. Ch'oe never neglected reading and writing, and his research on Korean history (朝鮮史) is said to have greatly advanced (大進) through this opportunity. While we anticipate (豫信) that Mr. Ch'oe's profound thoughts and theories will be conveyed to the general brethren through various forms on various future occasions, we first publish several celebratory poems (詩頌) dedicated to his parents' sixtieth birthdays (壽辰), composed during his imprisonment or immediately after his release.

Composed in Sŏdaemun Prison on Mother's 60th birthday (Hwangap)
A tower (塔) built towards heaven with diligence (勤勞) and purity (貞淑).
Adorned (嚴飾) with tears, engraved (鏤) with love (愛).
Your warm (溫) and radiant (耀燿) self is like the sun (太陽).

From the six (六) branches pulled forth (挻出), each branch is full of flowers (꼿).
Each flower will bear fruit (實), showing its abundance.
May you enjoy (享) and receive (受) sixty (六十) times sixty (六十) years (六十歲).

This body you excellently gave birth to, I have not used well until now.
I tried to make you smile, but my hands disobeyed (어귀도다) my heart (마암).
The delicate (纖弱) hand holding the cup (盞) feels ashamed.

Unexpectedly feeling overjoyed to be able to attend today's joy
Using the individual hairs (毛) of a thousand (千) oxen (牛) that haven't fallen out as a brush (筆).
Though the joyful expression (目皆) cannot compare (不可比擬) to even one tail's (尾) end (末),
I hope your heart's (心) bright mirror will reflect it. <132>

The sea (海) could be drunk dry (可飮盡), Mount T'ae (泰山) could be blown away (可吹盡).
Cultivating (修行) for countless eons (千萬劫), you manifested (示現) on your sixtieth year (六十歲).
There is no way (形喩之道) to depict (描畫) your boundless sunlight (日光).

The frustration of the blocked (阻斷) period is relieved by the openness (開通) of today (今日).
Before you who possess everything, I inherently have nothing to offer.
God knows this and that, here and there.

Composed in Sŏdaemun Prison in celebration of Father's 60th birthday (Suyeon)
All sorts (一切) of venerable (英偉) examples (典型) are gathered (俱備) in one body (一身).
Facing (對立) the mirror polished for sixty years (六十歲),
My foolish (愚騃) and frail (纖弱) appearance (相) is even more clearly revealed (表出).

You dispersed (普利) all the household assets (致得家産) gathered with sweat (勞汗).
Though the first birthday cup (壽杯) received is meager (薄) and cold (冷),
I cannot overcome my gratitude (不勝感激) for your smiling (筦爾) satisfaction (滿足).

You planted for flowers, but I have pulled up (揠) the roots.
Spring may come, but your hair has turned white.
Please become young again. I will tie down (繫留) that day (彼日).

Last July, on Father's birthday in Kyŏngsŏng Prison
Does the heart (마암) rushing (赴嚮) only towards you get blocked by iron bars (鐵柵)?
Is not this joyous day, this celebration (祝筵), even more like an arrow loosed from the bowstring (離弦矢)?
I hope you saw it as soon as your inner eye (心眼) opened.

Filtering the wine fermented (醱酵) in the chest through the heart (心臟),
After boiling it in true sincerity (眞衷), I offer it full in my intention.
As steam (蒸汽) becomes characters (文字), may you live for millennia (千秋萬歲).

Hearing you are returning to youth (還少), how can I not dance?
If it were mere rumor, it would be unknowable,
But faith (信心) surges (湧) spontaneously (自), so I know it must be true.

Shin-yu Year, Ninth Month, Twenty-seventh Day (Nine days after release from prison) <133>

**Summary**

This article from the magazine *Gaebyeok* introduces poems by Ch'oe Nam-sŏn (pen name Yuktang), written during his imprisonment in Sŏdaemun and Kyŏngsŏng prisons or shortly after his provisional release in October 1921. Ch'oe, known for drafting the Korean Declaration of Independence, was jailed for his role in the March 1st Movement. The introduction notes his continued scholarly work on Korean history while incarcerated. The poems themselves are deeply personal, expressing filial piety and regret towards his parents on their sixtieth birthdays (Hwangap and Suyeon). They reflect his confinement, his longing to properly celebrate with his parents, and his hope for their longevity, intertwining personal feelings with the constraints of his situation.

For historians, this article is significant as it provides a glimpse into the personal sentiments and resilience of a major figure of the Korean independence movement during his imprisonment. The poems, written in early 20th-century Korean with its distinctive orthography, offer insight into Ch'oe's state of mind—balancing filial duty, guilt over his inability to fulfill traditional roles due to his activism, and enduring hope, all under the duress of colonial suppression. The mention of his continued research on Korean history even in prison underscores the dedication of intellectuals to national identity during this period.
