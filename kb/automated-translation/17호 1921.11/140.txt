Admonitions (2)
						Yi Che-hyŏn of Koryŏ

Admonition for the Cat
You already have ears and eyes.
Also claws and teeth.
Burglars are running rampant.
Why do you sleep without stirring?

Admonition for the Dog
Your tail fawns.
Your tongue licks.
Do not fight, do not play idly.
Only guard against the fence being destroyed.

Admonition for the Chicken
Its crowing does not neglect the time.
Its fighting does not protect the hens.
Pecking dung, it gets fat.
It hastens itself to become a human sacrifice. <110>

**Summary**

This article presents three short admonitory poems (箴; *Jam*) written in Classical Chinese (Hanmun) by the Koryŏ dynasty scholar Yi Che-hyŏn. Each poem uses an animal—a cat, a dog, and a chicken—to impart a moral lesson. The cat is criticized for sleeping instead of catching pests or warning of intruders, the dog for fawning and playing instead of guarding, and the chicken for pointless fighting and base behavior (pecking dung) which ultimately leads to it being eaten. For historians, the publication of classical Korean literature by a prominent figure like Yi Che-hyŏn in *Gaebyeok*, a major cultural and nationalist magazine during the Japanese colonial period, is significant. It reflects an effort to preserve and promote Korean cultural heritage and traditional values in the face of colonial assimilation policies; the seemingly simple moral lessons might also have carried subtle contemporary relevance for readers reflecting on diligence, duty, and self-discipline.
