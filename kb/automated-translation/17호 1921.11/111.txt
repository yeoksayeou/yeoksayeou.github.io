Company Notice

One, Please send payment for this magazine and postage in advance (for three months, six months, or one year). We cannot send the magazine without advance payment.

One, When sending money from each district, please send it directly via postal transfer account Kyŏngsŏng 8106 under the name of the account holder, Kaebyŏksa. If you indirectly send it via postal transfer account Kyŏngsŏng 1363 under the name of the account holder, No Hŏnyong, it may not be processed at the expected time, and discrepancies may arise.

One, When sending money via postal transfer, please be sure to clearly write the reason for the remittance in the communication column on the back of the postal transfer form, specifically stating "X Won X Chŏn is payment and postage for Kaebyŏk from issue number X to issue number Y, for Z copies." If there is no information in the communication column, it creates significant difficulty in processing the payment.

One, When corresponding with our company, whether by postcard or sealed letter, please be sure to write clearly and send the sender's full name and exact address, including Province, County, Township, Village, and House Number. If the address is unclear, there is no way for us to send replies to your inquiries or the items you requested.

**Summary**

This company notice from Kaebyŏksa outlines subscription payment and correspondence procedures for the magazine *Kaebyŏk*. It emphasizes the need for advance payment, specifies the correct postal transfer account (Kaebyŏksa's direct account, not No Hŏnyong's), requests detailed information on remittance forms, and stresses the importance of providing a complete and accurate sender address for all communications. From a historical perspective, the notice highlights the logistical challenges of publishing and distribution in colonial Korea, particularly the reliance on the postal transfer system for payments and the need for meticulous record-keeping and clear communication to avoid errors, perhaps reflecting potential disruptions or inefficiencies in communications infrastructure or financial transactions during that period. The mention of a specific individual's account (No Hŏnyong) as a potential point of confusion suggests complexities in the company's financial or administrative setup.
