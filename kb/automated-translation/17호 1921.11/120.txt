Master Ch'oe Ch'iwŏn, Patriarch of Eastern Literature, Part Four of Introducing Chosŏn's Ten Great Men

1. The Master's Life
The Master's surname was Ch'oe (崔), his given name was Ch'iwŏn (致遠), his courtesy name was Haebu (海夫), and his style names were Koun (孤雲) or Haeun (海雲). He was born 1063 years ago in Muin year (戊寅), the 2nd year of King Hŏn'an (憲安王) of Silla, in Okku (沃溝), Honam province. Historical records are lost, so his lineage is unknown, but Master Ch'oe was exceptionally brilliant (穎絕倫) from a young age and loved learning, so at the mere age of 12, he followed a merchant ship to study abroad in Tang China. According to the preface Master Ch'oe himself wrote for his *Kyewŏn p'ilgyŏng* (桂苑筆耕), when he was 12 years old and about to leave his homeland, heading far west to become a passenger on a ship, his father admonished him, saying, "If you go to study in Tang like this and after 10 years still have nothing for which your name can be known in the world—that is, if you do not attain the honor of passing the civil service examination (擢拔 [及第])—do not call yourself my son. Once you have cast your feet into the sea of learning, I too will not think of you idly. Be diligent and do not betray this father's hopes (企願)." From this, one can infer that his family lineage was also quite respectable. Thus, Master Ch'oe encountered the customs of a foreign land in his youth and tasted the hardships (辛酸) of studying abroad, but he paid it no mind (小毫ᅵ介意함이 업고) and only strove to follow his father's strict instructions. As Master Ch'oe described himself, while diligently pursuing his studies without rest (孜孜無遑), he also did not neglect cultivating his character. Through extraordinary effort (人百己千의 積功), in the first year of Kŏnbu (乾符 元年 甲午) under Emperor Hsi-tsung (僖宗) of Tang (the 14th year of King Kyŏngmun [景文王] of Silla), he attained the glory of passing the examination in one attempt under the examiner P'ei Tsan (裴瓚), the Vice Minister of Rites (禮部侍郞). He was subsequently appointed Magistrate (尉) of Lishui County (溧水縣) in Hsüan-chou (宣州), then promoted again to Attendant Gentleman for Court Service and Censor-in-Attendance of the Inner Bureau (承務侍郞侍御史內供奉), and received the imperial gift of a purple and gold fish pouch (紫金魚袋). At that time, Huang Ch'ao (黃巢) rebelled, and Kao P'ien (高騈) became the Commander-in-Chief of the various circuits' field armies (諸道行營兵馬都統) to suppress him. Kao P'ien specially appointed Master Ch'oe as his Aide-de-Camp (都統巡官) and entrusted him with drafting military documents. Master Ch'oe devoted all his energy to this task, exhausting himself (盡瘁) in the position for four years. <86> The writings produced during this time—memorials, reports, and letters—are largely collected in the *Kyewŏn p'ilgyŏng* (桂苑筆耕) and survive to this day. Among these various documents, the piece *Hyŏk Hwang So Sŏ* (檄黃巢書, Proclamation Denouncing Huang Ch'ao) is particularly forceful in spirit (氣ᅵ勁), upright in intent (意ᅵ直), and powerful in style (筆이 雄), lacking any trace of artificial embellishment (雕鏤한 痕). It is said that upon reaching the lines, "Not only do all the people under Heaven think of carrying out your public execution, but even the ghosts beneath the earth have already plotted your secret punishment" (不唯天下之人 皆思顯戮 抑亦地中之鬼已議陰誅), even Huang Ch'ao could not suppress a tremor of great alarm, causing him to jump from his bed (大驚下床). This anecdote became a famous story throughout China and Chosŏn, and Master Ch'oe's literary fame subsequently resounded throughout the world.

He could not entrust his fate to a mere military commander, nor was a foreign land ten thousand *li* away the place to end his life. Afterwards, feeling there was nothing more to accomplish by following Kao P'ien and nothing more to see or hear by lingering in the West, Master Ch'oe firmly decided to return East. Aware of this sentiment, Emperor Hsi-tsung of Tang appointed Master Ch'oe as an official envoy (國信使) and sent him home with a personal letter. This was in the 11th year of King Hŏn'gang (憲康王) of Silla, Ŭlsa year (乙巳) (the first year of Kuang-ch'i [光啓 元年] under Emperor Hsi-tsung of Tang), when Master Ch'oe was merely 28 years old. The Silla court immediately welcomed and retained Master Ch'oe, having him serve through the reigns of two kings, Hŏn'gang and Chŏnggang (定康王). During this time, he held successive posts such as Reader-in-Waiting and Scholar of the Hallim Academy (侍讀兼翰林學士), Vice Minister of War (兵部侍郞), and Director of the Sŏsŏgam (瑞書監, Office for Auspicious Writings). However, this did not last for many years.

At this time, Master Ch'oe, having previously studied in the West and possessing ample knowledge, outstanding observation skills, and considerable ideals, intended to unfold his aspirations upon the Eastern land. However, the time was nearing the decline (衰季) of the Silla Dynasty, and the court was filled with petty men (群小). Every move he made only invited suspicion and jealousy from those around him, making it impossible for him to find a place for himself. He drifted away to distant provincial posts, serving as governor (郡守) of T'aesan (太山), Musŏng (武城), or sometimes Tangsŏng (當城). Later, in the 7th year of Queen Chinsŏng (眞聖女王), Kyech'uk year (癸丑) (the 2nd year of Ching-fu [景福 二年] under Emperor Chao-tsung [昭宗] of Tang), he was appointed as a New Year's envoy (賀正使) to Tang, succeeding Kim Ch'ŏhoe (金處誨), the Vice Minister of War and envoy bearing credentials (納旌節使兵部侍郞) (who had perished at sea en route to Tang and failed to complete his mission). However, due to famine and rampant banditry (盜賊) making travel dangerous, his journey was halted. It is said that he did travel to Tang as an envoy afterwards, but the year is unknown.

To borrow the phrasing of Kim Pusik (金富軾) as seen in the *Samguk Sagi* (三國史記), Master Ch'oe served Tang in the West and then returned to his homeland in the East, but in both cases, he encountered troubled times (亂世), facing continuous setbacks and difficulties (迍邅蹇連), often finding only blame (愆咎). Grieving his misfortune (不遇), he lost the will to pursue official advancement. From the time of Queen Chinsŏng, he began to roam freely (逍遙自放), building pavilions (臺榭) amidst the beauty of mountains and forests and by the shores of rivers and seas. He planted pine and bamboo, used books and histories as his pillow (書史를 벼개하며), and whistled poetry to the wind and moon (風月을 휘파람하얏나니). Namsan (南山) in Kyŏngju (慶州), Pingsan (冰山) in Kangju (剛州), Ch'ŏngnyangsa Temple (靑凉寺) in Hapchu (陜州), Ssanggyesa Temple (雙溪寺) on Chirisan Mountain (智異山), and his villa (別墅) in Happ'o-hyŏn (合浦縣) were all places where the Master wandered. Finally, he secluded himself in Haeinsa Temple (海印寺) on Kayasan Mountain (伽倻山), forming a spiritual friendship (道友) with his elder brother, the monk Hyŏn Chun (賢俊), and Master Chŏnghyŏn (定玄師). He lived there in quiet retirement (棲遲偃仰) until the end of his life. <87> His tomb is currently located in Hongsan (鴻山) in the Hosŏ region (湖西), and later generations built a Sŏwŏn (書院, Confucian academy) in Musŏng (武城), Honam province (湖南), to express their admiration (仰慕).

After Silla fell and Koryŏ took its place, during the reign of King Hyŏnjong (顯宗), it was said that Master Ch'oe had secretly aided (密讚) the founding of the Koryŏ dynasty and that his contribution should not be forgotten. He was posthumously awarded the title Naesaryŏng (內史令). Later, in the 5th month of Imsul year (壬戌), he was granted the posthumous title Munch'anghu (文昌侯, Marquis Munch'ang). (Here, the statement that the Master "secretly aided the founding of the Koryŏ dynasty" refers to the story that he sent the lines "Kerim's leaves are yellow, Koknyŏng's pines are green" [鷄林黃葉, 鵠嶺靑松] to Wang Kŏn [王氏], the future King T'aejo of Koryŏ [before his ascension], thereby hinting at Silla's decline [不振] and Koryŏ's inevitable rise [必作]. This tendency was something anyone could observe at the time, so it is unlikely that this single phrase significantly spurred Wang Kŏn. At the same time, claiming this constituted "secretly aiding" [密助] Wang Kŏn might be an exaggerated record—it is impossible to know for sure. However, it is presumed that the Master had already transcended worldly affairs [物外에 超然하얏섯슬 줄로 想察된다].)

2. Tang People's View of the Master
Having entered Tang at the age of 12 and returned to his country at 28, the Master spent a long period of 15 full years wandering (逍遙) in Tang. During this time, he shared classrooms with many young men in the Tang capital, competed in examinations alongside Tang literary figures, served as a local official or in military administration, and later entered the inner circle, close to Emperors I-tsung (懿宗) and Hsi-tsung (僖宗). Furthermore, he stood shoulder-to-shoulder with talented writers (文人才子). Undoubtedly, this young, talented, sharp (精敏), and open-minded (豁達) prodigy (寧馨兒) from a foreign land must have been admired (羡慕) by the Tang people of the time in various aspects, inspired a sense of awe (驚異), and consequently made the Tang people look upon Koryŏ/Chosŏn people (高麗朝鮮人) with greater respect and regard them affectionately (情답게 생각함이 되엇슬 것이라). In this sense, the Master's extraordinary literary genius and his dynamic personality represented all Koreans (全高麗人), leaving an indelible and most significant historical memory for the Chinese people. Accordingly, when the reporter thinks of Master Ch'oe of Silla, he is reminded of Mr. Ku Wigiun (顧維鈞, V.K. Wellington Koo) of contemporary China.

Even in Chinese records, which tend to abruptly cease writing (筆鋒을 거두다십히 한) when matters concerning Chosŏn or Koreans arise, records about Master Ch'oe appear in several places. A couple are excerpted here:
The *Hsin T'ang Shu* (新唐書) states: "Ch'oe Ch'iwŏn (崔致遠), a Koryŏ person (高麗人). Passed the Tribute Guest (貢賓) examination. Served under Kao P'ien (高騈) in Huai-nan (淮南). Authored one volume of *Saryuk* (四六, Four-Six Parallel Prose) and twenty volumes of *Kyewŏn p'ilgyŏng* (桂苑筆耕)."
The *T'ung Chih I Wen Lüeh* (通志藝文略) states: "Ch'oe Ch'iwŏn (崔致遠), one volume of *Saryuk*. A Tang person (唐人). Also twenty volumes of *Kyewŏn p'ilgyŏng*. By Ch'oe Ch'iwŏn of Tang. Memorials, letters, documents, proclamations (表牋文檄)."
The *Kuang Yü Chi* (廣輿記) states: "Ch'oe Ch'iwŏn (崔致遠), a Silla person (新羅人). During the Tang era, scholars from his country were permitted to participate in the examination for the wise and virtuous (賢科). Ch'iwŏn and Ch'oe Kwang'yu (崔匡裕) studied abroad in China (中華) and successively passed the Chin-shih (進士) examination." <88>
The *Liu Ch'ao Shih Chi* (六朝事跡) states: "Record of the Twin Maidens' Tomb (雙女墳記). By Ch'oe Ch'iwŏn (崔致遠), a Kerim person (鷄林人, i.e., Silla person). During the Ch'ien-fu era (乾符中) of Tang, he was appointed Magistrate of Lishui (補溧水尉). He once rested at the Chaohsien Pavilion (招賢館). On the hill in front, there was a tomb called the 'Twin Maidens' Tomb' (雙女墳). He inquired about its story, but no one knew it. He thus composed a poem to mourn them. That night, he felt the two maidens appear, expressing their thanks, saying: 'We were originally the two daughters of Mr. Chang (長氏) from Ma-yang Village (馬陽鄕), K'ai-hua County (開化縣), Hsüan-ch'eng Prefecture (宣城郡). From a young age, we were familiar with brush and inkstone (筆硯), and the elder possessed literary talent (才情). Unexpectedly, our parents matched us with petty salt merchants (鹽商小竪). Due to this, we died of indignation (憤恚). In the 6th year of T'ien-pao (天寶), we were buried together here.' This is the true story. They departed at dawn. This place is 110 *li* south of Lishui County (溧水縣南一百一十里)."
From the above, one can understand the Master's position and reputation in Tang at the time.

Furthermore, during his studies in the West, Master Ch'oe interacted with various literary figures, becoming particularly close (親切) with the Chiang-tung (江東) poet Lo Yin (羅隱) and Ku Yün (顧雲), who passed the examination in the same year. When he was returning to his country, Ku Yün composed a poem to bid him farewell, saying:
"I have heard of the three golden turtles (金鰲) in the sea, / On the turtles' heads sit high mountains. / Above the mountains, pearl palaces and shell courts, golden halls (珠宮貝闕黃金殿), / Below the mountains, thousand, ten thousand *li* of vast waves (千里萬里之洪濤). / To the side, a spot of Kerim (鷄林) green, / The turtle mountains nurtured talent, producing the extraordinary (奇特). / At twelve, he crossed the sea eastward by boat, / His literary works moved the Middle Kingdom (中華國). / At eighteen, he strode boldly through the literary battlefield (戰詞苑), / With one arrow, pierced the golden gate strategy (金門策)."
From this as well, one can glimpse an outline of the Master's personality and writings.

3. The Master's Writings and Public Opinion
The Master's known works include the *Kyewŏn p'ilgyŏng chip* (桂苑筆耕集) in 20 volumes, the *Chungsan pokkwe chip* (中山覆簣集) in 5 volumes, *Kŭmch'e pu* (今體賦, Contemporary Rhyme-Prose) in 1 volume, *Kŭmch'e si* (今軆詩, Contemporary Verse) in 1 volume, *Chapsi pu* (雜詩賦, Miscellaneous Poems and Rhyme-Prose) in 1 volume, and separately, a *Munjip* (文集, Collected Works) in 30 volumes. However, today only one set (秩) of the *Kyewŏn p'ilgyŏng chip* survives. According to the Master's explanation, *Kyewŏn p'ilgyŏng* (literally "Ploughing with a Brush in the Cassia Garden") was so titled because, finding himself amidst turmoil (亂離) (during his time in Tang) and lodging (寓食) in a military camp (戎幕), it was, so to speak, his way of earning his keep ("eating porridge here, congee there" - 饘於是粥於是), hence he used "brush-ploughing" (筆耕) as the title.

The Master originally had diverse literary interests (多趣), actively composing poems reflecting his sentiments (情性을 諷詠하얏스며) from the age of 14 or 15. When he became the Magistrate of Lishui County in Tang, his stipend was generous and his duties light (祿厚官閑), allowing him to dedicate himself even more to literature. The aforementioned *Chungsan pokkwe chip* was completed during this time. While serving under Kao P'ien, he recorded himself that he composed over ten thousand pieces (萬有餘首) besides official military documents. After returning home, he traveled through various places and later secluded himself on Kayasan Mountain; undoubtedly, he must have produced many more writings afterwards, but they have not been transmitted at all.

The style (軆) of the Master's writing largely follows parallel prose in four- and six-character phrases (騈儷四六). Some criticize that it fails to fully express emotions (情에 曲盡함을 엇지 못하고) and tends merely towards ornate rhetoric (文華). However, this was unavoidable (不得已) due to the prevailing trend (風會의 所趣) of parallel prose in the Chinese literary scene at the time. From the reporter's perspective, while it is true that most of the Master's writings adopt the parallel style, his works lack contrived artifice (苟且한 技巧). <89> They flow freely and naturally (暢達自在), possessing an inherent lofty style (高風) that cannot be easily dismissed. They should not be spoken of in the same breath as the parallel prose of Tang writers. Moreover, the production of writings worthy of transmission to posterity in our East began with the Master. His every word and phrase has been cherished (愛慕不措) by Eastern scholars through the ages, making him the foremost figure (第一人) in the Eastern literary world. Today, anyone discussing literary studies (文章學) in Chosŏn cannot avoid studying the Master's writings first, and the reporter asserts that upon studying them, one will surely find much to gain.

Finally, one thing must be said. The most laughable behavior among those Koreans who study literature (글을 工夫하는 者) is that, in the past, they thought nothing was literature unless it was the *Book of Odes*, the *Book of Documents*, the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, or the collected works of Tang and Sung writers. More recently, they think nothing is worth reading unless it is poetry, prose, or novels imported from the West or Japan. This delusion (惑) is so severe it defies description (形言할 수가 업다). If people hold themselves in such contempt (自侮), how can they avoid being scorned (侮蔑) by others? Just as one must count one before counting two, before delving into others' literature, one must first delve into one's own literature (for instance, starting with something like the *Tongmun Sŏn* [東文選]—I am aware this remark might stray [말이 歧路에 닷는 것을 모름이 아니나], but I say this because the behavior of our literary students is truly pitiful [넘우 딱하기에]).

One last thing I wish to mention is the Master's free-flowing and unrestrained (暢達不覊) character. Even today, when transportation is so convenient, studying abroad is not such an easy task. What kind of spirit (氣槪) did it take, over a thousand years ago, at the tender age of twelve (年纔十二), to resolutely undertake studying in the Tang capital by following a merchant ship? Despite staying long in the West, his fame resounding throughout the court and country, and being revered (떠이다십히 할) by all the foreigners, once he decided to return East, he cast aside all his reputation and position like worn-out shoes (헌신작가티) and immediately returned home. Even after returning, once he observed the unfavorable circumstances of the time (時勢의 非), he no longer harbored ambitions for an official career (仕道의 意). Instead, he remained composed (自若) amidst beautiful rivers, waters, and famous mountains, ending his life in such a manner—this is something not easily emulated (企及) by anyone. Such an expansive character can be found in any part of his writings. In this sense, the Master's extant works retain their value as treasures (珍寶) all the more. The argument that Ch'oe Ch'iwŏn was merely a man concerned with literary flourish (文華) and thus unsuitable for enshrinement in the Munmyo (文廟, Confucian shrine)—even if it was advocated by Master T'oegye (退溪先生, Yi Hwang), renowned for his integrity (純實)—the reporter cannot find reason in that statement. Why? Because it is merely a claim made without understanding the Master's position in Chosŏn's cultural history and his lofty character (高趣의 性格).
Here, several pieces—a proclamation, memorials, and poems—<90> sufficient to glimpse the Master's writing style and thought are presented verbatim in the original text.

[Translation of Ch'oe Ch'iwŏn's writings]

**Proclamation Denouncing Huang Ch'ao (檄黃巢書)**
On the eighth day of the seventh month, the second year of Kuang-ming (廣明), the Commander-in-Chief of All Circuits, Grand Commandant So-and-so (某) proclaims to Huang Ch'ao (黃巢). To uphold righteousness and follow the constant norms is called the Way (道). To manage crises and adapt to change is called expediency (權). The wise achieve success by acting according to the times; the foolish fail by going against reason (理). Thus, although life spanning even a hundred years has an uncertain end, in the myriad affairs governed by the mind, right and wrong can be discerned. Now, I, leading the imperial army, aim for subjugation without unnecessary battle; our military governance prioritizes benevolence before punishment. We intend to recapture the capital (上京) and hereby announce our great sincerity, respectfully conveying the Emperor's fine decree to quell treacherous schemes. You were originally a commoner from a remote place (遐甿), suddenly becoming a powerful bandit (勍寇). Seizing an opportunity, you recklessly dared to disrupt the established order. Consequently, you harbored malicious intent, usurped the imperial regalia (神器), invaded the capital city and palaces, and defiled the imperial court (宮闈). As your crimes reach the heavens (罪極淊淹天), your utter defeat and ruin (敗深塗地) are inevitable. Alas! Since the time of Yao (堯) and Shun (舜), rebellious tribes like the Miao (苗) and Hu (扈) have existed. Lawless and shameless individuals, disloyal and treacherous types—what you have done, in which generation has it not occurred? In the distant past, there were Liu Yao (劉曜) and Wang Tun (王敦) who coveted the Jin (晉) throne. More recently, there were An Lu-shan (祿山) and Chu Tz'u (朱泚) who barked and clamored against the imperial house (皇家). They either held powerful armies or occupied high positions. When they shouted, thunder roared and lightning flashed; when they raised a clamor, fog and smoke filled the air. Yet, despite their temporary success in treacherous plots, these wicked sorts were ultimately annihilated. How can the vast wheel of the sun tolerate demonic vapors? The net of Heaven is cast high; it will surely eliminate the vicious clans. How much more so for you, who emerged from the lowest rungs of society (閭閻之末), rising from among the fields (壟畝之間)? You consider robbery in the manner of Ch'u (楚刦) as good strategy and killing and wounding as urgent tasks. Your great offenses are too numerous to count even if every hair were plucked (擢髮); you have not a single small good deed to redeem yourself (贖身). Not only do all the people under Heaven think of carrying out your public execution, but even the ghosts beneath the earth have already plotted your secret punishment (陰誅). Even if you linger as a borrowed breath or wandering soul (假氣遊魂), your spirit should long have fled, your courage shattered (亡神奪魄). In all human affairs, nothing is better than self-awareness. I do not speak idly; you must listen carefully. Recently, our state, with deep virtue that tolerates impurities (德深含垢) and great benevolence that overlooks flaws (恩重棄瑕), bestowed upon you the commander's insignia (節旄) and entrusted you with regional command (方鎭). Yet you still harbored venom (鴆毒) and did not silence your owl-like screeches (臬聲). Your actions bite people; your conduct is like a dog barking at its master (吠主). You even turned against the profound transformation (玄化) and brought calamity upon the Ziwei Palace (紫微, Imperial Palace). Dukes and marquises fled onto dangerous paths; the imperial procession traveled to distant lands. Instead of quickly returning to virtue and righteousness, you nurtured stubborn wickedness. Thus, the Sage Emperor (聖上) showed you the grace of pardoning crimes, while you committed the crime of betraying grace (辜恩之罪) against the state. Your death must be imminent; why do you not fear Heaven? Moreover, the tripods of Chou (周鼎) are not something you should inquire about; the Han palace (漢宮) is certainly not a place for you to rest comfortably. I do not know your intentions, what do you ultimately wish to achieve? Have you not heard? The *Tao Te Ching* (道德經) says, "A whirlwind does not last all morning; a sudden shower does not last all day. Heaven and Earth cannot sustain things for long, how much less can man?" Have you also not heard? The *Spring and Autumn Annals* (春秋傳) commentary says, "When Heaven seems to aid the wicked, it is not blessing them; it allows their wickedness to grow thick before sending down punishment." Now you conceal treachery and hide violence, your evil accumulated, your calamity overflowing. You find security in peril, lost and unrepentant. This is like the cormorant nesting on a tent flap (鷀巢幕上), recklessly soaring at will; or fish swimming in a tripod cauldron (魚戲鼎中), soon to be scorched and boiled. I have gathered brilliant strategies and assembled various armies. Fierce generals fly like clouds; brave warriors gather like rain. Tall banners and great flags surround you like the wind from the Chu Gorges (楚塞之風); warships and multi-decked vessels block the waves of the Wu River (吳江之浪). Grand Commandant T'ao (淘大尉) is sharp in defeating enemies; Vice Director Yang (楊司空) is strict and can be called divine. Surveying the eight directions, they march across ten thousand *li*. Spreading fierce fire to burn goose feathers (鴻毛) is already assured; how is this different from lifting Mount T'ai (泰山) to crush sparrow eggs (雀卵)? Today, the Metal Spirit (金神, Autumn) commands the season; the Water Lord (水伯) welcomes our army. The autumn wind (商風) aids our solemn might; the morning dew cleanses the murky air. The waves have subsided; the roads are clear. We shall soon untie the mooring ropes at Stone Head (石頭), with Sun Ch'üan's (孫權) rear palace behind us; we anticipate furling our sails at Hsien-shou (峴首), with Tu Yü (杜預) leading the way. Recapturing the capital is expected within ten days (旬朔). However, valuing life and abhorring killing is the deep benevolence of the Supreme Emperor (上帝); bending the law to extend grace is the great statute (令典) of the grand dynasty. Those who punish official rebels harbor no private resentment; admonishing the lost requires frank words. My brief message flies to you to relieve your dire predicament (倒懸之急). You should not be like one clinging stubbornly to the bridge pillar (膠柱); learn quickly to see the opportunity (見機). Plan well for yourself; if you have erred, be able to reform. If you wish for a fiefdom <91> and land grant, to establish a state and pass it to your descendants (開國承家), avoiding the severing of head and body, attaining meritorious fame, do not trust flattering friends (面友), but pass down glory to your descendants (耳孫). This is not something women or children understand; it is truly the business of a great man (大丈夫). Reply quickly; do not doubt. My mandate is received from High Heaven; my trustworthiness is assured like clear water (白水). My words must evoke a response; grace should not be met with deep resentment. If, however, you are led astray by mad impulses, your drunken eyes not yet awakened, still intending to resist like a mantis trying to stop a chariot (拒轍), stubbornly waiting by the stump like the foolish farmer (守株), then the army that seizes bears and drags leopards will annihilate you with one command. Your crow-like rabble (烏合), owl-like scattered forces (鴟張之衆) will disperse in all directions. Your body will become grease for the executioner's axe (齊斧之膏); your bones will become powder under the war chariot wheels (戎車之粉). Your wife and children will be executed; your clan will be exterminated (宗族見誅). Imagine the time when your belly fat is burned (燃腹之時); you will surely regret it, biting your navel too late (噬臍不及). You must weigh your options, advance or retreat; distinguish gain from loss. Compared to rebelling and perishing, how does it compare to submitting and gaining glory and nobility? What is hoped for can surely be attained. Strive to follow the path of a brave warrior; resolve quickly to transform like a leopard (豹變). Do not cling to the concerns of a fool; sitting and waiting in doubt (坐守㧓疑). So proclaims So-and-so (某告).

**Memorial Requesting to Resign from Office and Retire (讓官請致仕表)**
Your servant, So-and-so (臣某), states: I humbly understand that when a sage ruler governs the realm, he must first block the gate of favoritism (倖門). When a good official reflects on himself, his only worry is obstructing the path of the worthy (賢路). To rashly invite criticism of one's office is to betray the ruler's grace. Moreover, your servant lacks merit in pacifying difficulties within the passes (關中); externally (*外), I lack accomplishments in sharing the burdens of state (分憂之效). To forcefully seek ease and comfort in honored position and salary would be to stain the legal statutes (刑章). Reflecting long on acting according to one's capacity, one must surely withdraw oneself. Knowing this without concealment, how can I avoid stating my reasons? Your servant, So-and-so, is truly ashamed and fearful, bowing my head, bowing my head. In my youth, I strove to polish myself; in later years, I learned military strategy (擒縱). Not focusing on just one classic (一經), I paid some attention to the three strategies (三略). Wishing to continue my family's merits and not fail the ancestral legacy (堂搆), the late Emperor (先皇帝), mindful of my lonely integrity, tested me with various difficulties. I was sent out to share the authority of a great general; I sat and received the rank and stipend of a high minister (上卿). Thus, internally I received instructions to diligently cultivate myself; externally I demonstrated the ability to restrain and stop [enemies]. Sweeping the barbarian dust in the north, the Hu tribesmen (胡雛) dared not graze their herds southward. Clearing the southern * sea (海), the Man spies (蠻諜) had no way to peek northward. When I had an audience at the vermillion court steps (彤墀), I briefly commanded the imperial guard (緹騎). Suddenly, sprouts grew in the suburbs of Ch'i (齊郊聚蘖); armies arose in the great marsh (鉅野興師). Your servant, lacking talent, was mistakenly entrusted with this duty. I encountered Your Majesty, Emperor, ascending to the ultimate throne (宸極), alerting and instructing the border defenses (戎藩). You raised banners and axes to share glory; you listened to drums and worried for the troops. Believing your servant possessed extraordinary strategy for pacifying troops (戢兵之奇略), observing my minor service in causing rebels to surrender (降寇之微勞), you consequently granted me a position equivalent to the Central Terrace (中台, Chancellery) and included my name among the external ministers (外相). My dreams reached the Phoenix Pond (鳳沼, Hanlin Academy); my authority became more imposing under the dragon banner (龍旌). Thereafter, the waves of the Lu River (瀘水) surged; the mists on the Shu Mountains (蜀山) darkened. The affliction of the tattooed barbarians (雕題之患) had long festered; disaster spread among the black-haired people (黔首之災). Again, I received your command, "Go!" (曰兪), to lead the army there. Following the order for a minor punitive expedition (薄伐), I was able to relieve their dire situation (倒懸). How could I dare claim Heaven's merit? I wished only to have it inscribed on bells and tripods (鍾鼎). Merely relying on the advantages of the terrain (因地之利), I built separate ditches and moats (溝隍). I humbly received Your Majesty's commendation for loyalty and special reward. You established a state, granting nobility like the Minister over the Masses (司徒) of Chou (周); established a house exceeding the honor of a Han (漢) Chancellor (丞相). At that time, I was already cautious about holding onto fullness (持盈) and often thought of requesting retirement (請老). I surely wished to announce my retirement in Chin-li (錦里, Chengdu) and retreat to seclusion on Mount Lo-fou (羅浮). Unexpectedly, farmers on the ridges (壟上耕夫) all took up poles and cut wood (揭竿斬木); wicked youths in the grass (草間惡子) vied to gather like ants and swarm like bees (蟻聚蜂飛). At the time when Ching Gate (荊門) fell, during the stationing of troops at the Chu Gorges (楚塞), I was appointed to the military banner (戎旆) and concurrently oversaw the salt monopoly (牢盆). Striving diligently, I could not repay your grace; rushing about, how could I dare speak of illness? Sometimes, monsters (*猰*) bared their teeth in the plains; sometimes, whales (鯨鯢) sprayed poison in the rivers and lakes. Soon, I was given authority for suppression and pacification (招討之權) and came to soothe the customs of Kou-wu (句吳, Wu region). Relying distantly on your sagacious strategy (睿略), I deeply thwarted the multitude of villains. Upon handing over my seal at Hai-men (海門) and establishing headquarters in Huai-tien (淮甸), the heavy responsibility of Commander-in-Chief (上將軍) topped the ranks of feudatories; the heroic resources of Grand Marshal (大司馬) first received lenient treatment. Measuring myself from head to heel, I am soaked in your benevolence; guarding the throat [of the region], I cannot offer even * dust-worth of service (埃). Moreover, since the Yellow Turban banditry surged and the imperial carriage went on tour, looking up to heaven and exerting all my strength, I secretly tried to follow Wang Tao's (王導) words; grieving all day, how could I stop at just shedding Yüan An's (袁安) tears? By the time the army was formed, due to receiving an imperial edict, I had to turn back. Although my movements followed the imperial words, my advance <92> and retreat truly shamed me in public opinion (物論). Consequently, Shih P'u (時溥) initiated military action in Pei-lin (北林); Chou Pao (周寶) incurred reproach from the southern neighbor. Jade always worries about being burned together; gold also fears being melted by the crowd. Fortunately, Your Majesty encompassed me with ocean-like magnanimity (海量) and illuminated me with heavenly light (天光). Seeing my innermost thoughts (肺腸), I was able to preserve my head. However, your servant, like Hsien Chen (先軫) who asserted his will through frank words, or Ts'ao Chih (曹植) who blamed himself for deep errors—for two years holding the title of Commander-in-Chief, I could not execute villains and quell violence; for four years managing the copper and salt affairs, I could not enrich the state and supply the army. Therefore, military authority has been repeatedly transferred; the levers of profit have also long been divided. All these instances of disgracing your mandate are due to my shortcomings. I myself know this, how much more so Your Majesty? Plucking my hair, I cannot count my crimes; begging for dismissal (乞骳), I only wish to resign from glory. Now that the great rebel has fled, the capital is recovered, the evil vapors are about to be exterminated, and the realm will forever see clarity and peace. Your servant, having unworthily ascended the platform [of command], has been unable to repay the state. Approaching the age of sixty (朞齒), how can I stay on with any face? Furthermore, having recently garrisoned the barbarian frontiers and long resided on miasmic peaks, exposed to demonic mists and poisonous fogs while eradicating monstrous boars and giant snakes, I did not shirk hardship in those years, but in old age, it has all turned into illness. Not using strength for propriety is recorded in the ancient classics; if body and mind betray each other, it is difficult to escape future troubles. Although I try to force myself to eat, I am truly ashamed of receiving salary without merit (素湌). Moreover, Kuang-ling (廣陵) is upstream of the Ch'u marshes; the salt administration (鹺府) is a major responsibility from the Han dynasty. For your servant, old and weak, to face this heavy difficulty, I greatly fear I will ultimately achieve nothing and thus hope to stop if it is not feasible. I humbly beseech Your Majesty, Emperor, who knows men wisely and pacifies the realm with many officials, to select a talented person to replace me in this region and allow this humble servant to retire to a leisurely post (散地). Tou Yü-t'u's (鬪於菟) fleeing wealth was certainly loyal; Wang Nei-shih's (王內史) resignation from office was truly not feigned. Fortunately, we encounter Shun's benevolent influence extending everywhere, the Han sun shining again. Your Majesty is already relieved of the worry of late meals (旰食之憂); may this humble servant also hope to be spared from restless nights (夜行不息). Your servant, overwhelmed with hope for grace, longing for the sage ruler, urgently, sincerely, and tremblingly presents this memorial to inform you.

**Sacrificial Text for Fallen Generals and Soldiers at Hansik (寒食祭陳亡將士文)**
Alas! That life has limits is lamented by ancients and moderns alike. That fame is immortal is primarily due to loyalty and righteousness. You strained your bodies drawing crossbows, showed courage under shield-wagons, roused your spirits in the ranks of bears and tigers, forgetting yourselves before geese and storks. You could display bravery with shield and spear, thus avoiding shame in the bedchamber. Now, the wild grass is green, the forest orioles sing sweetly. The distant, flowing river carries endless regret; rows upon rows of desolate tombs, who can verify if the souls still perceive? What I remember is your past merits; what pains me is this fine season. Offering these humble * provisions (薄*) to console your wandering spirits in the netherworld, we pledge together to resist the rebels. Though ineffective like Tu Hui (杜回), longing to return home like Wen Hsü (溫序), you achieved your heroic ambitions. This is called hidden aid (陰助).

**Parting Words for a Daoist Nun (留別女道士)**
Always regretting entanglement in official life amidst the dust, / For several years, deeply glad to have known Ma Ku (麻姑, Daoist immortal). / Upon leaving, I speak my true heart to you: / When will the ocean's waters ever dry up completely (枮)?

**Replying to Scholar Wu Luan's Two Quatrains on the Pain of Parting (酬吳巒秀才惜別二絶句)**
Glory and disgrace, danger – we couldn't grow close in such times, / Don't lament the temporary toil on diverging paths. / Today, parting afar, I have no other words: / This one heart must have nothing to be ashamed of before others.

The setting sun, the geese in the pass, high and distinct, / Evening mist, the trees on the islet, distant and lingering. / Turning back my head at this moment, feelings are limitless, / At the sky's edge, a lone sail gently flies over the waves.

**Tidal Waves (潮浪)**
Like sudden snow, overturning frost, ten thousand layers deep, / Coming and going with the moon's phases, following prior traces. / Seeing you (the tide) maintain faith throughout the day, / Ashamed am I, following trends, utterly lazy (放慵). / Against stone cliffs, battle sounds like flying thunderbolts, / Cloud peaks' inverted reflections shake hibiscus flowers (芙蓉). / Remembering Tsung Ch'üeh's (宗殼) words of the long wind, / Heroic spirit surges, recalling the Sleeping Dragon (臥龍, Zhuge Liang).

**Sandbank (沙汀)**
Seen from afar, it looks like flying snowflakes, / Its delicate nature, inherently unable to sustain itself. / Gathering and scattering depend solely on the tide's waves*, / High and low, moreover, shaped by the sea wind's sweep (厀¹, archaic for 膝/swept). / Mist envelops the refined sand where human tracks vanish, / Sun shines on the condensed frost where cranes step slowly. / Full of parting sorrow, I chant poems till night, / How unbearable when the moon is full again. <93>

**Summary**

This 1921 article from *Kaebyŏk* magazine introduces Ch'oe Ch'iwŏn, a late Silla scholar-official, as the fourth of "Chosŏn's Ten Great Men." It recounts his life, focusing on his youthful studies in Tang China, his literary achievements there (notably the *Kyewŏn p'ilgyŏng* and the "Proclamation Denouncing Huang Ch'ao"), his return to Silla, his disillusionment with the declining dynasty's politics, and his eventual retirement into seclusion. The article emphasizes his literary prowess, his esteemed reputation among Tang figures, and his strong, independent character. It argues for his significance as the "Patriarch of Eastern Literature" and defends his stature against criticisms (like those attributed to Yi Hwang) questioning his place in the Confucian tradition, concluding with translations of several of his works. From a colonial history perspective, the article is interesting for its explicit project of identifying and celebrating "Great Men" of Korean history, asserting a distinct national literary and cultural heritage during a period of Japanese rule. The comparison of Ch'oe Ch'iwŏn to the contemporary Chinese diplomat V.K. Wellington Koo also subtly positions Korea within a broader East Asian context, highlighting historical Korean influence and achievement on an international stage.

東方文學의 宗祖인 崔致遠 先生, 朝鮮 十大 偉人 紹介의 其四
1. 先生의 一生
先生의 姓은 崔요 名은 致遠이오 字는 海夫요 號는 孤雲이며 또는 海雲이니 距今 1063年前 新羅 憲安王 2年 戊寅에 湖南沃溝에 生하다. 史傳이 泯滅하야 그 世系를 알지 못하나 先生은 自幼時로 穎絶倫하얏스며 또 學을 好하야 年이 겨우 12에 商船을 조차 唐에 游學하얏다. 先生의 親筆에 成한 桂苑筆耕自序에 依하면 先生이 12歲에 鄕土를 떠나 멀리 西를 向하야 船中의 客이 되려할 際에 其父-警誡하야 가르되 『네가 이와 가티 唐에 游學하야 10年에 오히려 너의 이름이 可히 世에 稱할 것이 無하면 即 擢拔(及第)의 榮을 不得하면 내 子息이라 이르지 아니할지며 네-이제 한번 學海에 발을 던진 以後에는 내-또한 苟苟히 너를 眷念치 아니할지니 삼가 부즈런하야 이 아비의 企願을 孤負함이 업스라』하얏다 하는바 그 家系가 또한 相當하얏던 것을 이로써 推知할 수가 잇다. 先生은 이와 가티 弱冠에 異國의 風物을 接하얏스며 旅窓의 辛酸을 맛보앗스나 小毫ᅵ介意함이 업고 오즉 其父의 嚴訓을 힘써 服膺하야 先生의 自敍한 바와 가티 한便으로 修學의 孜孜無遑하는 同時에 다시 性情을 修養하기에 게을리 아니하야 人百己千의 積功으로써 唐 僖宗 乾符 元年 甲午(新羅景文王 14年)에 禮部侍郞 裴瓚의 檢榜 下에서 一擧로 及第의 榮을 得하고 仍히 宣州溧水縣尉가 되고 다시 昇差하야 承務侍郞侍御史內供奉이 되며 紫金魚袋의 御賜를 바닷섯다. 그때에 黃巢가 叛하매 高騈이 諸道行營兵馬都統이 되어써 그를 討할새 先生을 辟하야 都統巡官을 除하고 軍書署理의 任에 當케 한바 先生은 이에 竭力抵當하야써 前後 4年을 其職에 盡瘁한 中＜86＞ 當時의 産物, 表章書啓는 大部 桂苑筆耕에 收載되어써 今에 至하며 그 여러 書章中에도 檄黃巢書 1篇과 如함은 氣ᅵ勁하며 意ᅵ直하며 筆이 雄하야 別로 雕鏤한 痕이 無하며 『不唯天下之人 皆思顯戮 抑亦地中之鬼已議陰誅』라 한 句節에 至하야는 黃巢로도 能히 大驚下床의 動悸를 禁치 못하얏다 함은 中國朝鮮을 通하야 喧傳되는 話柄으로서 先生의 文名은 이때부터 天下에 喧藉하게 되엇섯다.
一個武將에게 其身을 托할 바가 아니며 萬里異域은 其生은 終할 곳이 아니라. 其後, 高騈을 쪼차 더불어 할 것이 업고 西土에 논이러 더 見聞할 것이 업슴을 느낀 先生은 斷然히 歸東할 뜻을 가젓다. 이 機味를 알은 唐의 僖宗은 先生으로써 國信使를 拜하고 親翰을 어써 歸寧케 하니 때는 新羅 憲康王 11年 乙巳(唐 僖宗 光啓 元年)이며 先生의 年은 겨우 28歲이엇다. 朝廷에서는 곳 先生을 迎留하야 憲康, 定康의 兩朝를 歷事케 하는 間에 侍讀兼翰林學士, 兵部侍郞, 瑞書監 等을 歷拜하얏다. 그러나 이것은 그러케 長年月間의 事는 아니엇다.
이때 先生은 일즉이 西土에 遊하야 豐當한 見識과 卓越한 觀察과 相當한 理想으로써 將次 自己의 뜻을 東土의 우에 펴고저 하얏스나 때는 新羅朝의 衰季에 瀕하야 群小가 朝에 滿한바 一動一靜은 한갓 左右의 疑忌를 어든바 되어 其身을 容치 못하고 멀리 外方으로 떨어져 或은 太山, 或은 武城, 또 或은 當城의 郡守되엇섯다. 그後 眞聖女王 7年 癸丑(唐昭宗景福 2年)에 納旌節使兵部侍郞 金處誨의 後(入唐 途中에서 海에 沒하야 不果)를 繼하야 賀正使로서 唐에 入使하게 되엇섯스나 때 巧히 飢荒으로 盜賊이 橫行하야 通行의 危險으로 其行을 止하얏스며 그後에 唐에 入使한 일은 잇섯스나 그 年代는 未詳하다 한다.
三國史記에 보인 金富軾의 筆法을 빌어써 말하면 先生은 西으로 唐을 事하다가 東으로 故國에 歸하얏스나 다-亂世를 遭하야 迍邅蹇連, 걸핏하면 愆咎뿐 엇게 되매 스스로 不遇를 슬퍼하야 다시 仕進할 뜻을 두지 아니하고 眞聖王때부터 逍遙自放하며 山林의 밋과 江海의 가에 臺榭를 지으며 松竹을 심고 書史를 벼개하며 風月을 휘파람하얏나니 慶州의 南山과 剛州의 冰山과 陜州의 靑凉寺와 智異山의 雙溪寺와 合浦縣의 別墅는 다-先生의 逍遙하던 곳이며 最後로 伽倻山 海印寺에 몸을 숨기고 그 兄浮屠賢俊과 定玄師의 2人으로 더불어 道友를 맷고 棲遲偃仰하야써 其身을 終하얏는대＜87＞ 其墓는 지금 湖西의 鴻山에 在하며 後人이 湖南武城에 書院을 建하야써 仰慕의 意를 表하얏섯다.
新羅가 가고 高麗가 代한 其後 顯宗 在位時에 先生으로 高麗의 祖業을 密讚한 바 其功을 가히 잇지 못할 것이라 하야 內使令을 追贈하고 其後壬戌 5月에 다시 贈謚하야 文昌侯라 하얏다.(여긔에 先生의 所謂 高麗의 祖業을 密讚하얏다 함은 當時 麗太祖王氏(未登極前)에게 鷄林黃葉, 鵠嶺靑松의 句를 答與하야써 新羅의 不振과 高麗의 必作을 暗示하얏다 하는 그것을 指함이니 是는 當時에 잇서 누구나 觀察한 바 傾向이엇던 바 그 한말이 別로 王氏를 激勵한 바가 되지 못하얏슬 것인 同時에 이로써 王氏를 密助하얏다 云云함은 誇張의 記錄이 아닐는지 實際 모르거니와 先生은 벌서 物外에 超然하얏섯슬 줄로 想察된다.

2. 先生에 對한 唐人의 見解
12歲에 唐에 들어가 28歲에 歸國하얏슨즉 先生은 滿15年間의 長時日을 唐에서 逍遙하얏다. 其間에는 唐京의 多數靑年과 더불어 學窓을 가티 하얏스며 唐의 文士와 가티 選拔을 다토앗스며 또 或은 地方官 或은 兵馬의 間에 立하얏스며 다시 들어와서는 懿宗, 僖宗의 左右에 잇섯고 나아가서는 文人才子와 肩을 竝하얏섯다. 모르거니와 그 年少하고 多才하고 또 精敏하며 또 豁達한 異國의 寧馨兒인 先生은 반듯이 여러 가지 方面으로 當時 唐人의 羡慕를 바닷슬 것이며 驚異의 威念을 주엇슬 것이며 그로 因하야 唐人은 一層 高麗朝鮮人을 쳐다보게 되엇스며 高麗人을 情답게 생각함이 되엇슬 것이라. 이 意味에 잇서 先生의 그 非凡한 文學上天才와 밋 그 敏活한 人格은 全高麗人을 代하야써 中國人에게 歷史的의 슬어지지 못할 가장 意義잇는 記憶을 주엇다할지며 딸아 記者는 當時 新羅의 先生을 追想할 때에 今日 中國의 顧維鈞氏를 聯想하게 된다.
朝鮮 혹 朝鮮人에 關한 事이라 하면 約束하고 筆鋒을 거두다십히 한 中國書記에도 先生에 대한 記錄은 그곳 書記中 여러 곳에 나타낫나니 그 一二를 摘記하면
新唐書에는 曰 『崔致遠 高麗人 貢賓及第 高騈淮南從事 著四六一卷 又桂苑筆耕二十卷』
通志藝文略에는 曰 『崔致遠 四六一卷唐人 又桂苑筆耕二十卷唐崔致遠表牋文檄』
廣輿記에는 曰 『崔致遠新羅人 唐時許其國士子 就試賢科 致遠與崔匡裕二人 遊學中華 接踵成進士』＜88＞
六朝事跡에는 曰 『雙女墳記 鷄林人 崔致遠唐乾符中 補溧水尉 嘗憩于招賢館 前岡有塚 號曰雙女墳詢其事跡莫有知者 因爲詩以吊之 是夜感二女至 稱謝曰 兒本宣城郡開化縣馬陽鄕長氏二女少親筆硯 長負才情, 不意爲父母匹于鹽商小竪 以此憤恚而終 天寶六年同葬于此寔語至曉而別 在溧水縣南一百一十里』
右로써 볼지라도 當時 唐에 在한 先生의 位地와 名聲의 如何되얏던 것을 알 수가 잇다.
그리고 先生의 西遊時에 여러 文人과 交遊하던 中 江東詩人 羅隱과 또 그 同年되는 顧雲으로 더불러 가장 親切하얏는데 歸國할 때에 顧雲이 詩로써 送別하얏스니 曰
『我聞海上三金鰲 金鰲頭載山高高 山之上兮 珠宮貝闕黃金殿 山之下兮 千里萬里之洪濤 傍邊一點鷄林碧 鰲山孕秀生奇特 十二乘船渡海東文章感動中華國 十八橫行戰詞苑一箭射破金門策』이로써 또한 先生의 人與文에 對한 輪廓을 엿볼 수 잇다.

3. 先生의 文章과 世論
先生의 著書로는 桂苑筆耕集 20卷과 中山覆簣集 5卷과 今體賦 1卷과 今軆詩 1卷과 雜詩賦 1卷과 別로 文集 30卷이 잇섯다 하나 지금은 다못 桂苑筆耕集 1秩이 傳할 뿐이다. 桂苑筆耕이라 함은 先生의 說明에 依하면 때마츰 亂離(在唐時)를 當하야 戎幕에 寓食한 바 所謂 饘於是粥於是라 이에 筆耕으로써 目을 삼은 것이라 한다.
先生은 本來 文學에 多趣하야 14, 5歲로부터 盛히 情性을 諷詠하얏스며 唐의 溧水縣尉가 되엇슬 時는 祿厚官閑하야 더욱 文學에 意를 致하얏스니 右에 말한 中山覆簣集은 이때에 成한 것이며 高騈의 幕下에 잇슬 때는 軍書以外에 萬有餘首의 글을 지엇다 自記하얏스며 그後 歸來하야 各地를 歷遊하며 伽耶山에 隱한 그後에는 勿論 더 만흔 著書가 잇섯슬 것이나 全然히 전하지 못하엿다.
先生의 文은 그 軆가 大槪 騈儷四六에 依한 그 情에 曲盡함을 엇지 못하고 한갓 文華에 流한 便이 多하다. 非難하는 便이 업지 아니하나 이는 그 때 中國文壇에서 盛히 騈儷를 當하얏던 바 風會의 所趣에 진실로 不得已함이 잇섯슴이며 記者로써 보건대 先生文章이 大部 騈儷의 軆를 取한 것은 事實이나 그 文에는 苟且한 技巧를 加한 것이 無하고＜89＞ 暢達自在하야 스스로 侮示치 못할 高風이 잇는 바 唐人의 騈儷文과 더불어 同日하야 말할 것이 아니며 그리고 우리 東方에서 能히 後에 傳할만한 著書를 出하기는 先生으로부터 始한 바 그 一言一句는 歷代 東方士子의 愛慕不措한 바 되어써 東方文壇의 第一人을 作하얏나니 今日 朝鮮에서 文章學을 말하는 者 - 먼저 先生의 文章을 硏究하지 아니할 수 업스며 硏究하면 반듯이 어들 것이 만흘 것을 記者는 斷言한다.
終에 一言할 것은 우리 朝鮮사람 中 글을 工夫하는 者의 行爲 中에 第一 웃으운 것은 前日에 잇서서는 詩書春秋나 唐宋文集이 아니면 글이 아닌 줄로 알앗스며 또 近日에 미처는 西洋이나 日本으로 輸入된 詩나 文이나 或 小說이 아니면 읽을 것이 못되는 줄을 아나니 惑의 甚이라 무엇이라고 形言할 수가 업다. 사람이 이러탓 自己를 自侮하고야 어찌 他人의 侮蔑을 當치 아니할 수가 잇스리오. 둘을 혜이기 전에 먼저 하나를 헤임과 가티 남의 文學에 미츠기 전에 먼저 自己의 文學(爲先 東文選가튼 것에 미츰에 잇스라 말이 歧路에 닷는 것을 모름이 아니나 우리 글 배우는 士子들의 行爲가 넘우 딱하기에 一言이다.

最後로 一言하고 십흔 것은 先生의 暢達不覊한 그 性格이다. 모든 交通機關이 便利할 때로 便利케 된 今日에도 外國留學이 그러탓 容易한 일이 아니거든 千有餘年前의 그때에서 年纔十二에 商船을 從하야 唐京留學을 斷行한 그 氣槪는 어떠하며 오래동안 西土에 잇서 그 名聲이 朝野에 떨치고 온 異國人이 그를 떠이다십히 할 그 때임에 不拘하고 한번 歸東을 決한 以後는 그 모든 聲譽와 地位를 헌신작가티 집어버리고 곳 歸朝하얏스며 歸朝以後에도 그 時勢의 非를 한번 觀察한 先生은 다시 仕道의 意를 가지지 아니하고 麗水名山의 間에 自若하야 其身을 終함과 如함은 그 누구라도 쉽게 企及치 못할 바이라. 이와 가튼 暢達한 性格은 그 著書中 어떠한 部分에서라도 차저볼 수 잇나니 先生의 遺書는 이 意味에서 一層 珍寶의 一됨을 不失한다 하겟스며 崔致遠은 한갓 文華를 是當한 사람인 바 文廟에 配享함이 不可함을 말한 그것은 비록 純實키 有名한 退溪先生의 主張이라 한 者라도 記者는 그 말의 有理함을 생각치 못하겟다. 웨 그러냐하면 이는 先生의 朝鮮文化史上의 地位와 그 高趣의 性格을 理解하지 못하고 主張하는 말임에 不過한 故이다.
이에 先生의 文章과 着想을 엿보기에 足한 書, 文, 表,＜90＞ 數篇을 原文대로 摘示한다.

榮辱危時未及親, 莫嗟歧路暫勞身. 今朝遠別無他語, 一片心湏不愧人.
殘日塞鴻高的的, 暮烟汀樹遠依依. 此時回首情何限, 天際孤帆窣浪飛.

潮浪
驟雪飜霜千萬重, 往來弦望躡前蹤. 見君終日能懷信, 慙我趨時盡放慵. 石壁戰聲飛霹靂, 雲峰倒影撼芙蓉. 因思宗殼長風語, 壯氣橫生憶臥龍.
