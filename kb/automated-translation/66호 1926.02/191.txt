Special Announcement

As our company's business expands daily, our office affairs have naturally become busy. Recently, specifically to simplify business related to the Kyŏngsŏng area and to strive for the convenience of our readers, we have established a Kyŏngsŏng General Sales Office as described below. Therefore, from now on, those within Kyŏngsŏng city who wish to purchase "Kaebyŏk, Sin Yŏsŏng, Ŏrini" published by our company, please make direct requests to the Kyŏngsŏng General Sales Office.

**Summary**

This article is a special announcement from the publisher of the magazine *Kaebyŏk* (along with *Sin Yŏsŏng* and *Ŏrini*). It informs readers that due to business expansion and increasing workload, a dedicated General Sales Office has been established in Kyŏngsŏng (colonial Seoul) to handle sales within the city more efficiently and provide greater convenience for readers. It provides the name of the director, the address, and the telephone number for the new office. For historians, this notice highlights the growth and operational development of a major Korean publishing house during the colonial period, illustrating its efforts to establish a formal distribution network within the capital city, Kyŏngsŏng, reflecting both commercial activity and the reach of Korean-language publications at the time.
