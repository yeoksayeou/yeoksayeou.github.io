**Summary**

This "Social Diary" chronicles events from mid-December 1925 to mid-January 1926, heavily featuring the volatile situation in China during the Fengtian-Zhili War. It details the rise and fall of Guo Songling, the maneuvers of Zhang Zuolin and Feng Yuxiang, Japanese military intervention in Manchuria and Tianjin, and widespread Chinese protests against Japan. Concurrently, it reports on events within Korea under Japanese rule, including arrests of activists (communists, T'ongŭibu), labor strikes (Mokp'o, Kunsan), tenant farmer disputes (Muan), social organizing (Chŏnju women's school, Wŏnsan youth), large fires (P'yŏngyang, Kaesŏng, Mokp'o), activities of armed Korean resistance groups, and conflicts between Koreans and Japanese both in Japan and Korea (Mie prefecture, Yi Sŏn-hong's Sŏnuhoe). It also covers international news like Soviet politics, European affairs, and natural disasters. For historians of Korean colonial history, the article is valuable for its juxtaposition of major international events (especially in China and involving Japan) with local Korean happenings. It highlights the pervasive impact of Japanese imperialism, Korean resistance in various forms (organized independence movements, armed struggle, labor action, social protests), the socio-economic hardships faced by Koreans (refugees, labor disputes, tenant conflicts), and the colonial state's repressive measures (censorship, arrests, police actions). The mention of specific groups like T'ongŭibu and incidents like the Sŏnuhoe inauguration provide concrete examples of the political dynamics of the time.
