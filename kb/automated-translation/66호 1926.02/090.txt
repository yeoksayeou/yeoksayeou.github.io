京城雜話
						尖口生

It is something that generally elicits bitter smiles when old-style gentlemen of the first rank, such as Dr. Sŏ Chae-p’il and Mr. Yun Ch'i-ho, occasionally publish thoughtless words recklessly in newspapers and magazines. Now, they have once again published their usual rambling nonsense in the New Year's issue of the *Sinmin* magazine this time, drawing much criticism from society. One would like to ask those two gentlemen if they knew that *Sinmin* magazine, published and edited by Yi Kak-chong, a commissioned official (囑托) of the Social Affairs Section of the Government-General of Chosŏn, was merely the successor to the *Tongnip Sinmun* (Independence Newspaper) they managed during the days of the Independence Club. You first-rate old gentlemen, experts on America! How truly admirable you are.

The wound that the monkey Yi Wan-yong received when he was stabbed by Mr. Yi Chae-myŏng reportedly reopens and causes him to moan every year when winter comes. This winter, it is said to be even worse, and he is in great pain. Nevertheless, he did not miss the recent banquet hosted by Governor-General Yuasa, attending and delivering a response that was both congratulatory and pitifully pleading, saying, "To fully reveal the actual achievements of Chosŏn's governance, it lies in the Governor-General not changing his post frequently, thus I hope Your Excellency will remain in Chosŏn for a long time," and so on. However, what can be done when this old injured thing (老傷物), whose fate is not long, cannot see those actual achievements? Is this not perhaps his final lament?

The Government-General of Chosŏn building, constructed at a huge cost of 7 million yen over a long period of more than 8 years, was recently completed. At the beginning of the New Year, they moved from Waesŏngdae, and as a ground-pacifying ceremony (地鎭祭) combined with a demonstration (示威運動), they even specially held an unprecedented military review on the main street of Kwanghwamun in broad daylight.

However, that government building comprises the Secretariat (房官; below the Secretary's office: Foreign Affairs Section, Documents Section, total 15 rooms), Home Affairs Bureau (內務局; Director's office, Local Affairs, Social Affairs, Architecture & Civil Engineering Sections, total 22 rooms), Finance Bureau (財務局; Director's office, Tax Affairs, Accounting, Finance Sections, total 12 rooms), Industry Bureau (殖産局; Director's office, Agriculture, Forestry, Mining, Commerce & Industry, Land Improvement, Fisheries Sections, total 18 rooms), Justice Bureau (法務局; Administration, Legal Affairs, Director's office, total 5 rooms), Education Bureau (學務局; Director and Inspector's office, Academic Affairs, Religious Affairs, Editing Sections, total 6 rooms), Medical Affairs Bureau (醫務局; Medical Affairs, Higher [Education?], Security, Sanitation Sections and Director's office, total 12 rooms), plus the Forest Land Survey Committee office (林野調査委員會室; 2 rooms), adding rooms for errand boys (給仕), janitors (小使), reception, and night duty, totaling over 120 rooms. It accommodates more than 1,500 personnel. Furthermore, besides this, there are 3 large and small conference rooms and even a dining hall and restrooms fully equipped, earning it the title of the so-called "Model Grand Government Hall of the Orient."

And as a characteristic feature of the Government-General of Chosŏn, the restrooms are strictly divided into high-ranking official restrooms and lower-ranking official (判任官) restrooms (as was the case in the previous Waesŏngdae building). Besides that, the dining hall for high-ranking officials is vast and splendid, exceeding that of a hotel, while the dining hall for lower-ranking officials and below is not only poorly equipped, but one must submit a meal ticket (食堂傳票) to one's supervisor one hour before lunchtime every day, and even carry one's own tea bowl and teapot. Thus, lunchtime resembles a chaotic marketplace. Also, at the main entrance (玄關) of the same building, guards stand rigidly, investigating every visitor, and reportedly deny free entry to anyone other than Bureau Directors. This naturally draws much criticism from visitors, and there seems to be considerable discontent among the lower-ranking officials themselves.

It's truly said, "three years for a new person to settle in, three years for a new house." Having built such a large government building, it's normal for there to be quite a bit of trouble. Also, since they even held a solemn military review, there shouldn't be any fear of some kind of earth-moving ghost (動土鬼) appearing, but it seems public sentiment will only stabilize once they have a proper offering ceremony (고사떡).<61>

On their return journey, Japanese troops dispatched to Manchuria suffered food poisoning from lunch boxes on a Kyŏngŭi Line train. Over 200 soldiers experienced vomiting and diarrhea. Perhaps the owner of that lunch caterer received some request from the vengeful ghosts (寃鬼) of General Kwak Song-nyŏng and his wife?

The number of electric lights in Tokyo, Japan, is 2,145,000, averaging 4.66 lights per household. The total number of electric lights in Kyŏngsŏng, Chosŏn, is said to be 185,000, averaging merely 2.06 lights per household. Looking at it this way, Kyŏngsŏng appears to be about half as dark as Tokyo.

According to recent surveys, regarding the wealth of the world's six major capitalist nations, the United States ranks first with 700 billion yen, followed by Great Britain with 360 billion yen, France with 200 billion yen, Germany with 166 billion yen, Italy with 60 billion yen, and Japan, though last, with 500 billion yen. Also, the average national wealth per person is reportedly 7,914 yen for Great Britain, 6,580 yen for the United States, 4,820 yen for France, 2,770 yen for Germany, 1,630 yen for Italy, and 890 yen for Japan. However, this "wealth" is ultimately that of a few capitalist bastards (資本家 놈); the actual wealth of the general populace is not like that. As the power of capitalists grows stronger, the suffering of the proletariat becomes more severe, leading to an increasingly miserable state. Consequently, a great counter-movement (대운반동) against this arises fiercely. How many more days can the fate of those capitalist cliques (資本閥) truly be maintained?

Looking at the national census statistics table, the total population of Chosŏn is 19,519,927, of which 10,018,729 are male and 9,501,198 are female. Males outnumber females by 517,531, meaning there are slightly over 105 males for every 100 females. However, looking at the actual production rate, females exceed males. This is ultimately because the current social system and family system value only men and treat women poorly, failing to protect them properly, resulting in a higher mortality rate for women. How can this not be a matter demanding attention?

Speaking of women, women and men are both the same kind of people. Since men's short haircuts (斷髮) are no longer an issue now, why specifically (奚特) make such a big deal about women's short haircuts? However, after a few instances of bobbed hair among the "New Women" recently, it has become an issue, causing controversy in the press, education circles, and even literary circles. Lately, some youth association even held a debate on the pros and cons of bobbed hair, re-enacting the old drama from the time when the Short Hair Ordinance (斷髮令) was issued in the Ŭlmi year (1895), when stubborn fellows (頑固輩) declared, "This head may be cut, but this hair cannot be cut" (此頭可斷 此髮不可斷), and also quoted, "Body, hair, and skin are received from parents; not daring to injure them is the beginning of filial piety" (身軆髮膚 受之父母 不敢毁傷 孝之始也), even starting righteous armies (義兵). If you're going to make an issue of it, how about holding a national convention or starting a righteous army again?<62>

**Summary**

This commentary by "Sharp Tongue" (尖口生) critiques various aspects of colonial Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul) in 1926. The author mocks pro-Japanese Korean figures like Sŏ Chae-p’il and Yun Ch'i-ho for contributing to a Government-General affiliated magazine, sarcastically reports on Yi Wan-yong's suffering and sycophancy, and describes the newly completed, opulent Government-General building, highlighting the discriminatory segregation within it (e.g., separate restrooms and dining halls for high and low officials). The piece contrasts Kyŏngsŏng's dim lighting with Tokyo's brightness, discusses global wealth disparities criticizing capitalism, notes the gender imbalance in Korea's population statistics suggesting neglect of women, and finally, ridicules the conservative backlash against women cutting their hair short, comparing it to the resistance against the 1895 mandatory haircut ordinance.

For historians, the article offers valuable insights into colonial Korean society: the sharp critique of collaborators and Japanese authority, detailed descriptions of the physical and social hierarchy within the new Government-General building (a potent symbol of colonial power), contemporary awareness of economic disparities (local and global), and social commentary on changing gender roles and the conservative resistance they faced, specifically the controversy over women's bobbed hair. The author's sarcastic and critical tone reflects the underlying tensions and nationalist sentiment of the era.

徐載弼博士와 尹致昊氏 등 일류의 舊式 신사들이 잇다금 주책업는 말을 신문잡지상에 함부로 발표하는 것은 일반이 苦笑를 禁치 못하는 일이다. 그런데 그들은 이번 新民雜誌 新年號에 例의 橫說竪說을 또 발표하야 사회의 비난을 만히 밧는다. 그 두 분은 朝鮮總督府社會課囑托 李覺鍾君의 主幹發行인 新民雜誌를 그전 독립협회시대에 그네가 경영하던 독립신문의 후신으로만 알엇는지 좀 물어보고 십다. 米國通의 一流老紳士들! 엇지 그다지 갸륵한신고.

李完用猴는 李在明氏에서 被刺한 상처가 해마다 冬節이 되면 다시 도저서 신음하더니 今年冬節에는 더욱 심하야 매우 고통중에 잇다 한다. 그래도 요전 湯淺政務總監宴會에는 빠지지 안코 參叅하야 祝辭兼哀乞의 答辭를 하되 「朝鮮統治의 實蹟을 충분히 나타나게 하랴면 政務摠監이 其任을 頻變치 안는데 잇슨 즉 각하는 長久히 朝鮮에 在任하기를 희망한다고 云云하얏다 한다. 그러나 운명이 未久한 老傷物이 그 實蹟을 볼 수가 업는데야 엇지하리오. 此 소위 최후의 비명이 안일가.

700萬圓의 거대한 금액과 8個餘年의 長久한 세월을 費하야 건축공사를 하던 朝鮮總督府는 這間 竣工이 되야 新年初에 倭城臺로부터 이전하고 地鎭祭兼示威運動으로 白晝 光化門 大街에서 前日에 업던 觀兵式까지 별달리 거행하얏다.

그런대 그 廳舍는 官房(秘書官室以下 外事課, 文書課, 合15室), 內務局(局長室, 地方, 社會, 建築土木課 幷22室), 財務局(局長室, 稅務, 司計, 理財 幷12室), 殖産局(局長室, 農務, 山林, 鑛務, 商工, 土地改良, 水産六課 幷18室), 法務局(行政, 法務, 局長室 幷5室), 學務局(局長及視學官室, 學務, 宗敎, 編輯3課 幷6室), 醫務局(醫務, 高等, 保安, 衛生 4課及局長室 幷12室)外 林野調査委員會室(2室)과 給仕, 小使室, 受附宿直室을 加하야 全部 百 20室 이상에 *하고 수용인원이 1,500餘人에 달하며 또 此外에 大小會議室 3個所와 食堂 便所까지 완전히 설비되야 소위 東洋模範의 大政廳이라는 칭호가 잇다.

그리고 朝鮮總督府의 특색으로 便所에도 高等官便所와 判任官便所를 엄격히 구분하고(前日倭城臺廳舍에도 그랫지만)其外 식당도 高等官食堂은 「호텔」 이상으로 廣大華麗하고 判官以下의 식당은 설비가 불완전할 뿐 외라 점심때마다 1시간 전에 食堂傳票를 自己主任에게 제출치 안이하면 안이되고 茶碗 茶罐까지 자기가 持去하게 되야 점심시간이면 난장판 갓고 또 同廳의廳 玄關正面에는 수위가 잔뜩 서서 出入客을 일일조사하야 局長 이외에는 自由出入을 不許한다고 하야 방문객의 비난이 多함은 물론이고 下級官吏 자체에서도 불평이 퍽 만흔 모양이다.

眞所謂 새사람 드러와 3年이오 새집 지어 3年이라고 그만한 큰 廳舍를 지어 노코 여간 말성 좀 잇기가 例事이요. 또 위엄한 觀兵式까지 거행하얏슨즉 何等의 動土鬼가 나터날 염려는 업지 만은 고사떡은 한번 잘 해먹어야 인심이 안정될 것 갓다.＜61＞

滿洲에 出動하엿던 日本軍隊는 歸途中京義線列車에서 점심밥에 중독이 되야 兵士 200餘名이 중독되야 吐瀉를 하얏스니 그 밥집 주인이 郭松齡將軍夫妻의 寃鬼에게 무슨 부탁이나 밧지안엇는지.

日本東京市의 電灯數는 214만5천燈으로 每戶 4燈6分6里의 比가 되고 朝鮮京城의 電燈總數는 18만5천個로 每戶에 僅히 2燈6里의 比가 된다 한다. 그리고 보면 京城은 東京보다 半쯤 暗黑한 모양이지.

최근 조사에 의하면 世界 6大資本國의 富力은 米國이 第一로 7천억圓에 달하고 次에는 英國이 3천6백억圓, 佛國이 2천억圓, 獨逸이 1천660억圓, 伊太利가 600억圓, 日本은 最下지만 500억圓이 되고 又 國富一人의 平均額은 英國이 7,914圓, 米國이 6,580圓, 佛國이 4,820圓, 獨逸이 2,770圓, 伊太利가 1,630圓, 日本은 890圓의 比例가 된다 한다. 그러나 그 富力이라 하는 것는 역시 몃몃 資本家 놈의 것이요 실제 일반 민중의 富는 그럿치 못하다. 資本家의 세력이 강대하니만콤 無産者의 고통은 더 심하야 날로 비참한 境에 至하고 따러서 거긔에 대한 대운반동이 격렬하게 이러난다. 彼等 資本閥의 운명은 과연 몃칠이나 더 유지할지.

國勢調査統計表를 見하면 朝鮮의 總人口는 1,951만9,927人中 남자는 1,001만8,729人이요, 여자는 950만1,198人인대 남자가 여자보다 多하기가 51만7,531人으로 여자 100에 대하야 남자는 105强이 된다. 그런대 실제 生産率을 보면 여자가 남자보다 多하니 그것은 究竟現社會의 제도나 가정제도가 남자만 중시하고 여子를 賤待하야 보호를 잘하지 안는 까닭에 여자의 사망율이 多한 소이니 엇지 注意치 안이할 일이랴.

여자의 말이 낫스니 말이지 여자나 남자나 다 가튼 사람이요 남자의 斷髮이 지금와서 문제거리도 되지 안는 이상에야 奚特女子의 斷髮을 가지고 그다지 문제삼을 것이 무엇 잇스랴. 그런대 근내 新女性 중에 몃 個人斷髮事件이 생긴 뒤로 한 문제가 되야 혹은 언론계 혹은 교육계 내지 文人界까지 말셩이 만터니 요사이에는 또 엇던 靑年會主催로 斷髮可否의 토론회까지 하야 乙未斷髮令이 下할 시대에 頑固輩들이 「此頭可斷이언정 此髮을 不可斷」이라 하며 또 「身軆髮膚는 受之父母하니 不敢毁傷이 孝之始也」라 하고 義兵까지 이르키던 舊劇을 復演한다. 旣히 문제를 삼으랴거던 國民大會를 한번 열던지 義兵을 다시 이르키는 것이 何如오.＜62＞
