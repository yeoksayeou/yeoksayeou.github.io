△After May 1st passed, it seems as quiet as a house after a shamanistic ritual (굿) has ended, not only in Kyŏngsŏng (京城) but throughout all of Chosŏn (朝鮮). Accordingly, our editorial office also feels comparatively quiet and leisurely. If it weren't for the lack of space, it feels like we could write as many thoughts as we have. However, as it is the season of falling flowers (洛花時節) and a world of tender green (軟綠世界), we haven't been able to achieve peace of mind (心緖).

△The field survey (踏査) of Hwanghae-do (黃海道), which had been postponed and planned for nearly three months, has finally come to an end. As Hwanghae-do takes up nearly sixty pages, this column feels somewhat insufficient. However, Hwanghae-do is also Chosŏn and also one side of the world, so how could *Kaebyŏk* show favoritism (何厚何薄)? We hope everyone reads it with equal interest.

△The problematic vicious ordinance (惡法令), the so-called "Peace Preservation Law" (治安維持法), was implemented in Chosŏn as of May 12th. While general movement organizations are naturally concerned, *Kaebyŏk* too cannot help but give it some consideration. We'll have to see how things turn out, but for now, it is extremely unpleasant. Reaction is mutually destructive (反動은 彼我一殺), so ultimately (及其) the advantages and disadvantages will likely be balanced (利害相半).

△We recommend Yi Tonhwa (李敦化)君's "The Changing Season and New Common Sense" (換節期와 新常識) for young people in their period of cultivation (修養期). "The Peace Preservation Law and the Future Chosŏn Social Movement" (治安維持法과 今後의 朝鮮社會運動) is offered for the reference of comrades fighting on the front lines of the movement. Ch'ŏngp'a (靑坡)君's *Chaptongsan'i* (雜同散異) and Ch'ŏng'o (靑吾)君's *Kyŏngsŏng Chapchi* (京城雜誌) are good materials for learning about regional affairs. Yi Minch'ang (李民昌)君's "Theory of Chosŏn's Economic Ruin" (朝鮮經濟破滅論) is a long piece, scheduled to be concluded in the next issue.

△The special feature of the literary section is the impressions regarding the joint critique (合評) of the Chosŏn literary scene, not to mention the usual critiques of creative works (創作), and especially the creative works of Messrs. Kim Tongin (金東仁), Kim Kijin (金基鎭), and Chu Yosŏp (朱耀燮). The editor is pleased, and we know the readers will also read them with joy.

△Next month, July, is the month commemorating the fifth anniversary of *Kaebyŏk*'s founding. As is the annual custom (年例), it will naturally be edited as a special commemorative issue. It is difficult to say definitively (確言) what kind of content and format will mark the fifth anniversary celebration, but it is our company's resolution (自期) to make it worthy of the fifth anniversary, surpassing the first, third, and fourth anniversaries. We also hope for many general submissions.

**Summary**

This editorial postscript from the June 1925 issue of *Kaebyŏk* reflects on the relative quiet after May Day, the completion of a large feature on Hwanghae Province, and expresses significant concern about the recent implementation of the Peace Preservation Law (治安維持法) in Korea on May 12th, acknowledging its potential impact on the magazine and social movements. It also previews articles in the current issue, including pieces on self-cultivation, the Peace Preservation Law's implications, regional affairs, economic theory, and literary works by prominent writers like Kim Tongin, Kim Kijin, and Chu Yosŏp. Finally, it announces the upcoming fifth-anniversary special issue in July. For historians, the article offers a contemporary glimpse into the atmosphere of colonial Korea shortly after the enactment of repressive legislation like the Peace Preservation Law, showing both the apprehension it caused among intellectuals and publishers and their determination to continue their work. The mention of specific articles and authors also provides context for the intellectual and literary currents of the mid-1920s.
