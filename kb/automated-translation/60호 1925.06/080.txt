Songdo Jottings

O The Songdo Shop Clerks' Association (松都店員會) planned to invite socialists from Seoul to hold a lecture meeting to commemorate May Day, but it is said they canceled it not only due to a police recommendation to stop but also because of much interference in various ways. Why are these gentlemen (兩班들), who hold the knife handle allowing them to immediately stop or ban any lecture deemed radical (過激) or actions deemed unstable (不穩), making such a fuss beforehand?

O On Children's Day, May 1st, under the auspices of the Kaesŏng Youth Association (開城少年會), children held a flag procession (旗行列), successfully concluded a fairy tale meeting (童話會), and were scheduled to hold a lecture meeting on youth issues (少年問題講演會) at 8:30 PM. However, it was unavoidably canceled due to a small audience. Although there were many conflicting factors, it is truly beyond regrettable and lamentable that the general public treats youth issues so lightly (等閒視함). People of Kaesŏng! Please think more for the second citizens (第二國民), and do not begrudge precious time, earnest hearts, and sincere efforts for the youth, the new masters (새 主人) of Chosŏn.

O Various organizations in Kaesŏng initiated the formation of a Famine Relief Association (飢饉救濟會) and negotiated several times with the police authorities (警察當局) regarding fundraising (寄附金募集). However, it is said they were ultimately forced to cancel because approval was not granted under nonsensical pretexts (口實) such as unstable actions, ideological movement (思想運動), local liaison movement (地方連絡運動), the timing, etc. (云云). What do they mean by so-called instability? What is unstable about trying to save compatriots (同胞) who are starving to death due to lack of food?

O On May 4th, all members of the Kaesŏng Hyŏngp'yŏngsa (開城 衡平社員) went on a no-butchery alliance strike (不屠동맹파업), causing meat shops and restaurants to completely run out of even a slice of meat and close down. Eventually, the demands of the Hyŏngp'yŏngsa members were met (貫徹되여서), and they resumed business (復業) from May 6th. It seems unity (團結) is truly formidable.

O On the past May 4th, the Central Hall Youth Department (中央會舘靑年部) held an East-West Music Concert (東西音樂會), inviting famous musicians (樂士) and achieving great success. The famously skilled singer *Tongbaek (東伯) was also invited, performing a rendition of the Song of Ch'unhyang (春香歌) accompanied by the janggu (長鼓). While the general audience greatly welcomed it, some stubborn old church workers (頑固한 老敎役者들) strongly opposed it, arguing that the Song of Ch'unhyang was too disorderly (亂하다). Younger church workers advocated for neutrality (無關), etc., causing a major dispute for a time. Eventually, the side arguing it was irrelevant (無關하다는 側) won, and the concert continued the next day with great success as before. Even if it is a church (禮拜堂), isn't it a concert hall during a concert and a lecture hall during a lecture? And what is the difference between piano (피아노), violin (빠이오랑), harmonica (하모니가) and the drum, cymbals (제금), piri (피리), gayageum (가야금) as musical instruments? What is the difference between Western songs and Eastern songs as songs? The argument of the aforementioned old church workers was strong opposition, claiming it was extremely disrespectful (無禮한) to sing the Song of Ch'unhyang in a church. Ultimately, isn't this a self-destructive nature (自亡性) arising from excessively ignoring and despising (無視하며 賤視하는) one's own things, and on the other hand, isn't it a perverse thought (괴思) stemming from the worship of Western noses and music (洋코 樂拜)?

O Even in seemingly docile Kaesŏng, the ideological group Liberty Association (思想團體自由會) has emerged, the Songdo Shop Clerks' Association (松都店員會) has formed a new front, the Songdo Youth Party (松都靑年黨) has been established, and a Hyŏngp'yŏngsa Branch (衡平分社) has been set up. Thus, not only is there a sense that social movements (社會運動) and ideological movements (思想運動) are surging with the momentum of sudden change (急轉直下의 세), but also, because all the aforementioned groups participated in the recent People's Activists Conference (民衆運動者大會), the Kaesŏng Police Station (開城警察署) is in an uproar (야단법석). Consequently, crackdowns (取締) and interference (干涉) have intensified. Liberty Association committee members are brought in for warnings (注意)! Songdo Shop Clerks' Association committee members are brought in for threats (威脅)! Songdo Youth Party committee members are brought in for investigation (取調)! This is how the sword-wearing gentlemen (칼찬 兩班) of Kaesŏng have begun to run wild. Especially after the implementation of the Peace Preservation Law (治安維持法), let it be said, they will plant their roots deeper and stronger, hidden beneath the surface.

**Summary**

This article from June 1925 details various social and political events in Kaesŏng (Songdo) during May of that year. It reports on police interference preventing a May Day lecture and famine relief fundraising, highlighting the authorities' suspicion of any organized public activity as potentially subversive. It laments the public's apathy towards Children's Day events but celebrates the success of a Hyŏngp'yŏngsa strike by butchers demanding fair treatment. A controversy over performing the traditional Korean *Song of Ch'unhyang* at a church concert reveals tensions between traditional culture and Western influence/conservative religious views. The article concludes by noting the rise of several new social and ideological organizations in Kaesŏng and the consequent increase in police surveillance and suppression, particularly with the new Peace Preservation Law, suggesting resistance will continue covertly. For historians, the article provides valuable snapshots of colonial-era life, showcasing the Japanese authorities' suppression of nascent social movements (labor, socialist, youth, self-help), the activities of specific groups like the Hyŏngp'yŏngsa, cultural conflicts arising from modernization and Western influence, and the pervasive atmosphere of surveillance under laws like the Peace Preservation Law. It reflects the growing social consciousness and organizational efforts among Koreans despite heavy-handed colonial control.

松都漫筆
O松都店員會에서는 『메-데이』를 紀念하기 爲하야 서울서 社會主義者들을 請하여다가 講演會를 開催하려 하엿쓰나 警察의 中止勸告가 잇쓸 뿐 안이라 여러 가지로 干涉이 만하서 中止하엿다 한다. 講演이 過激하거나 行動이 不穩하먼 곳 中止나 禁示식힐 수 잇는 칼자루를 잡고잇는 兩班들이 왜이리 미리 날뛰느냐 말이다.

O5月 1日 어린이날에 開城少年會 主催로 어린이들이 旗行列을 하엿고 또 童話會를 圓滿히 맛치고 午后 8時 半에는 少年問題講演會를 열기로 되엿섯쓰나 聽衆이 少數임으로 不得已 中止하고 말앗다는데 여러 가지로 相値되는 바가 만키도 하엿지마는 이러케도 一般이 少年問題를 等閒視함은 참으로 遺憾의 度를 지나 歎息할 만한 일이다. 開城사람들아 ! 좀더 第二國民을 爲하야 생각하는 바가 잇스며 朝鮮의 새 主人 少年을 爲하야 貴重한 時間과 着實한 마암과 眞實한 努力을 앗기지 말라.

O開城 各團體 發起로 飢饉救濟會를 組織하고 寄附金募集에 對하야 警察當局에 數次交涉하엿쓰나 不穩한 行動이니 思想運動이니 地方連絡運動이니 時期이니 云云하는 되지도 안은 口實 밋테서 結局 諒解치 안음으로 不得已 中止하엿다 한다, 그네들의 所謂 不穩이란 엇더한 것인가? 먹을 것이 업서 굴머 죽어가는 同胞를 救하려하는 것이 무엇이 不穩하다는 말이냐?

O5月 4日 開城 衡平社員은 全部 不屠동맹파업을 하엿씀으로 고기店에나 飮食店에는 고기 한 졈도 업서서 全部 閉店을 하엿섯다, 그러다가 結局 衡平社員의 要求가 貫徹되여서 5月 6日부터 復業하엿다. 團結이 무섭기는 무서운 貌樣이다.
O지난 5月 4日 中央會舘靑年部 主催로 東西音樂會를 열고 有名한 樂士들을 請하야다가 大盛況을 成하엿다는데. 소래 잘 하기로 有名한 *東伯이도 불러다가 長鼓를 뚜들겨 가면서 春香歌를 한바탕 뽑앗다. 一般 聽衆은 大歡迎은 하엿섯쓰나 一部 頑固한 老敎役者들은 春香歌는 너무 亂하다고 大反對를 하고 젊운 敎役者들은 無關을 主張하는 等 一時는 큰 말성이 되엇다가 結局 無關하다는 側이 勝利를 엇어 또 하로를 더 如前히 大盛況을 呈하엿다 한다. 아모리 禮拜堂이라 하여도 音樂會 時에는 音樂會場이며 講演會 時에는 講演會場이 안인가?
그리고 『피아노』 『빠이오랑』 『하모니가』와 북, 제금, 피리 가야금이 樂器임에 잇저서 무엇이 다르며 西洋人의 노래와 東洋人의 노래가 노래임에 잇서서 무엇이 다르단 말이냐? 前記 老敎役者들의 主張은 禮拜堂에서 春香歌를 부름은 너무나 無禮한 짓이라고 하여 大反對한 것이니, 이것은 結局 自己것을 너무나 無視하며 賤視하는 데서 나오는 自亡性이 안이며 또한편으로 洋코 樂拜에서 나오는 괴思나 아인가 한다,

O고분고분하여 보이든 開城에도 思想團體自由會가 생기고 또 松都店員會가 새 陣을 벼풀엇고 松都靑年黨이 생기엿고 衡平分社가 設置되엿다. 그리하야 社會運動 思想運動이 急轉直下의 세로 蜂起하는 感이엇슴만 안이라 前番 民衆運動者大會에도 前記 各團軆가 全部 참가하엿썻씀으로 開城警察署에서는 야단법석이다. 따라서 取締와 干涉이 甚하여젓다, 自由會委員을 다려다가 注意! 松都店委員會委員을 다러다가 威脅! 松都靑年黨委員을 다러다가 取調! 이러케 開城 칼찬 兩班은 날뛰게 되엿다. 더구나 治安維持法의 實施以後로는 말하야 둔다, 속으으로 속으로 더 깁히 뿌리를 튼튼히 박을 것이다.
