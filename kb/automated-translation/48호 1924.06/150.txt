Kyŏngsŏng as Seen Through the Media World
						Talsŏng

"Kyŏngsŏng as seen through the media world? Do you even *have* a media world?" someone might ask, eyes wide open. In truth, even I, the reporter, having put forth this title out of necessity, am genuinely unsure whether a media world exists in Kyŏngsŏng or not. To put it another way, is there or is there not Korean journalism? That is the question. It's not just a question; in Kyŏngsŏng, no, in Chosŏn, there has yet to be freedom of the press. It's not that it existed and then disappeared; it never existed from the beginning.

Never mind 1,000 or 2,000 years ago, but was there journalism for Koreans during the 500 years of the Yi Dynasty? Weren't the Korean people unable to move an inch under the politics of monarchical autocracy, the spirit of *sadae mohwa* (serving the great and admiring China), and the fixed rules of taking Confucius and Mencius as masters? Under the principle *chaeha cha yugu muŏn* (在下者 有口無言 - those below have mouths but no words), other than the monarch or those of special classes, one could not dare move the tip of their tongue or brush in public or private matters. If someone did speak out, they were labeled disrespectful or traitorous, facing exile or capital punishment. Under the principle *pi sŏnwang chi pŏpbok iŏdŭn pulgam pok* (非先王之法服이어든 不敢服 - Do not dare wear clothes that are not the prescribed attire of former kings), no matter how rotten or old, one was to revere the old and not dare create the new. It was so severe that even adding a single grammatical particle incorrectly to the classics was called *samun nanjŏk* (斯文亂賊 - a rebel disturbing Confucian ways), cutting off both speech and writing. What more needs to be said? Would the saying, "Do not speak of the trees in the palace" (*pulŏn kungjung su*), meaning one couldn't even talk about the trees in the palace, exist otherwise?

It was truly an incredibly frightening era. Among all this, there was something called journalism, exercised by those with special authority, in the sense of fulfilling one's final loyalty when the state's errors reached an extreme—that is, with the self-awareness of sacrificing one's body and even one's entire extended family for the king and country. This was the so-called *sojang* (䟽章 - memorial to the throne), where officials would prostrate themselves hundreds of times before the palace gates. This indeed represented loyalty exchanged for life. Next, among the common people, when there was class-based discontent or social unrest, to <87> appeal for redress, several brave individuals, prepared to sacrifice even their extended families, would circulate among the people documents called *sinwŏnsŏ* (伸寃書 - petition for redress, also called *soji* 所志) to government offices and *t'ongmun* (通文 - circular notices) among the populace. These represented a form of journalism, but beyond that, there was nothing.

Such has been the history of Chosŏn. People lived without knowing what journalism was at all. Then, around the 20th year of Emperor Kojong's reign, the year Kyemi (癸未 - 1883), the government established the Pangmun'guk (博文局 - Bureau of Culture and Information) and began publishing the *Hansŏng Sunbo* (漢城旬報), a newspaper written in classical Chinese. After the Kabo Reforms (甲午 - 1894), as people began to grasp the news from East and West, get a whiff of what new civilization was, achieve what seemed like independence or freedom even for a moment, and as Russia loomed large and Japan pressed closer and closer, several individuals known as patriots or several patriotic groups arose. They published several newspapers like the *Tongnip Sinmun* (獨立新聞), *Hwangsŏng Sinmun* (皇城新聞), *Taehan Maeil Sinbo* (大韓每日), *Cheguk Sinmun* (帝國新聞), and *Mansebo* (萬歲報), striving to promote patriotic thought through a kind of classical Chinese-style essay writing. However, as the overall situation changed rapidly, even such journalism vanished without a trace. Thus, the Chosŏn media world, which had briefly flickered like mushrooms after a long rain, crawled back into an even deeper dark cave than before. No, under the extreme censorship of the Japanese, it couldn't even wag its tail and fell into a deep slumber. The only media organs were the Government-General's official newspaper, the *Maeil Sinbo* (每日申報 - the former *Taehan Maeil*, run by an American, which the Government-General bought), and its separately run Japanese-language counterpart, the *Keijō Nippō* (京城日報). For the next 12 or 13 years, besides these official papers, there was nothing else. It was a state where only phantoms roamed a desolate land, an empty house without a master.

Just six years ago, when the Kimyo (己未 - 1919) independence movement erupted, the proponent of military rule, Terauchi, left, Hasegawa came, and then came Saitō, known for advocating so-called "cultural rule." While a large number of the Chosŏn populace was absorbed in the independence movement, they also devoted themselves to the movement for freedom of the press. Finally, in January of Kyŏngsin (庚申 - 1920), the year after Kimyo, the *Tonga Ilbo* (東亞日報), *Chosŏn Ilbo* (朝鮮日報), and *Sisa Sinmun* (時事新聞) were barely born as media organs. But how could this be considered proper freedom of the press? Every word, every stroke of the brush, ended up under the absolute power of the government authorities. Confiscation or suspension of publication was at their discretion; the freedom of the media organs did not extend to a single matter or item.

However, the cultural development momentum of the populace surged accordingly. Ideological groups were organized everywhere, lectures and debates were frequently held in Kyŏngsŏng and the provinces, and magazines, albeit under the publication law, were published, creating a sense that things were indeed different from before Kimyo. Thus, in June of Kyŏngsin (1920), the magazine *Kaebyŏk* (開闢) was founded, and the following year (Imsul - 壬戌, 1922), other journalistic magazines like *Sinsaenghwal* (新生活), *Sinch'ŏnji* (新天地), *Chosŏn chi Kwang* (朝鮮之光), <88> and *Tongmyŏng* (東明) emerged one after another, making noise this way and that, even if it was imprisoned journalism, journalism that lived day to day. Among these, *Sinsaenghwal*'s publishing rights were canceled due to suspicion of its ideology, *Sinch'ŏnji* was also forced to cease publication under the pretext of being subversive, *Chosŏn chi Kwang* resumed publication recently, and *Tongmyŏng* ceased publication last autumn. In its place, the daily newspaper *Sidae Ilbo* (時代日報) was born in March of this year.

Thus, the current Korean-language media organs present in Kyŏngsŏng are the four types: *Tonga Ilbo*, *Chosŏn Ilbo*, *Sidae Ilbo*, and *Maeil Sinbo*. Monthly magazines include *Kaebyŏk*, and weekly publications include *Sisa P'yŏngnon* (時事評論 - likely evolved from or related to Sisa Sinmun) and *Chosŏn chi Kwang*. As for Japanese-language organs, there are nearly 7 or 8 types, including *Keijō Nippō* (京城日報), *Chōsen Shinbun* (朝鮮新聞), *Keijō Nichinichi* (京城日日), *Keijō Shinbun* (京城新聞), and *Chōsen Mainichi Shinbun* (朝鮮每日新聞). Since they exist in a special category separate from Koreans, there is no need to elaborate on them here. Let's just know this much for now. <89>

**Summary**

The article, written in 1924, laments the historical absence and continued severe restriction of press freedom for Koreans in Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul). The author traces this suppression from the Yi Dynasty's autocratic rule, where dissent was harshly punished, through the brief emergence of newspapers around the turn of the 20th century, which were quickly extinguished. Under Japanese colonial rule, especially after the 1919 Movement, a few Korean newspapers and magazines were permitted under the guise of "cultural rule," but they operated under constant threat of censorship, confiscation, and suspension by the authorities. The author contrasts this heavily controlled Korean press with the more numerous Japanese-language newspapers operating in the city. Historically, the article is valuable for its contemporary perspective on the state of Korean journalism under Japanese censorship in the early 1920s. It underscores the limited reality of Saitō's "cultural policy" regarding freedom of expression and provides a firsthand account of the specific publications active (and suppressed) during this period, highlighting the persistent struggle for a Korean voice despite severe constraints.

『언론계로 본 京城? 너에게도 언론계가 잇느냐?』하고 누가 눈을 딱 부릅뜨며 뭇는 듯 십다. 實上 기자부터도 不得己에 의하야 題를 내 노킨 노앗스나 京城에 언론계가 잇는지 업는지 확실히 의문이다. 다시 말하면 朝鮮人의 언론이 잇느냐 업느냐? 그것이 의문이다. 의문이 안이라 京城에는 안이 朝鮮에는 아직것 언론의 자유가 업다. 잇다가 업서진 것이 안이라 본래부터 업섯섯다.
멀니 천年 前 2천年 前은 말도 말고 李朝 5백年에 朝鮮人에게 언론이 이섯드냐 말이다. 君主獨裁의 정치 事大慕華의 정신 孔孟 是師의 定則 하에서 꼼작달삭 못하든 朝鮮民族이 안이엿느냐. 在下者 有口無言이라 하야 군주나 혹은 特殊階級者 외에는 公私間 一言半辭 감히 혀끗 붓끗을 못 놀렷스며 혹-놀닌 者-잇다 하면 不敬이니 逆臣이니 하야 流配 或 極刑을 一手로 하얏고 非先王之法服이어든 不敢服이라 하야 썩엇거나 묵엇거나 古를 尙할지연뎡 新은 不敢做出이엿스며 심하야는 經書에 吐 한아만 잘못 달아도 斯文亂賊이라 하얏스니 言書俱斷이지 다시 말이 무엇이랴. 여간해서야 『不言宮中樹』라는 궁중에 잇는 나무를 보고도 말을 못한다는 말이 잇겟느냐 말이다.
참-엄청나게도 무서웟든 시대이다. 그 중에서도 언론이란 것은 特殊權이 잇는 자로서 국가의 非가 極에 達한 때에 최후의 忠을 盡한다는 의미로 즉 君國을 위하야 몸까지 九族까지 희생한다는 自覺으로 臣百拜上䟽于闕下라는 所謂 䟽章 그것이 잇섯다. 이야말로 생명과 相換되는 忠을 대표한 언론이엿다. 그 다음 민간으로서는 계급적 不平 或 사회적 불안이 잇슬 때면 그를＜87＞ 伸寃하기 위하야 멧 명의 壯圖가 九族까지 희생할 셈치고 관청에는 伸寃書(所志) 民間에는 通文이란 그것을 人人相傳하야써 一種의 언론을 대표한 것 외에는 업섯다.
朝鮮의 유래는 이러하얏다. 언론이 무언지 무어 무언지 도무지 몰노고 지내섯다. 그리든 것이 高宗帝 20년 癸未年 頃에 정부로서 博文局을 設하고 漢城旬報라는 漢文報 發行이 이서슬 뿐이엿다. 甲午 이후로 東西의 소식을 大綱斟酌 하게 되고 新文明이 무언지 거긔 냄새를 뜰만하고 一時나마 독립인지 자유인지 그것이 되게 되고 露國이 넘석넘석하고 日本이 밧작밧작 닥아붓게 되닛가 여기에서 일부 有志라는 멧멧 개인 또는 애국적의 멧멧 단체가 이러나서 獨立新聞이니 皇城新聞이니 大韓每日이니 帝國新聞이니 萬歲報니 그 다위 멧種 신문을 발행하야써 一種의 漢文式 論文으로 愛國思想 鼓吹에 노력하다가 大局이 急轉함에 따라 그런 언론까지도 그만 種跡도 볼 수 업게 되얏섯다. 이리하야 장마 때 버슷모양으로 에時-반작하든 朝鮮 言論界는 다시 前日 이상 陰窟 속에 쓱 드러가고 마럿다. 안이 日本人의 極端의 制裁 下에서 그만 꼬리도 흔드지 못하고 아조 長眠하고 마럿다. 언론기관이란 總督府機關報 每日申報(米國人 경영의 前 大韓每日을 總督府가 買受)와 또는 그와 同軆別行인 日文 京城日報가 이서슬 뿐이다. 伊來 12,3년간은 右機關報 외에는 다시 아무 것도 업섯다. 寂寞江山 無主空家에 오직 魍魎뿐 出沒한 상태이엿다.
바로 6년 전 己未의 독립운동이 이러나자 武斷兒寺內가고 長谷川이 오고 하더니 소위 文化爲名者 齋藤이가 왓다. 다수의 朝鮮민중은 일변 독립운동에 열중함과 동시에 일변 언론해방운동에 몰두하얏다. 맛츰내 己未의 翌年 庚申 1월에 와서야 언론기관이라고 간신히 東亞日報 朝鮮日報 時事新聞이 出生하게 되얏다. 그러나 엇지 상당한 자유의 언론이랴. 一言一筆이 관청의 절대권에 歸하고 마럿다. 혹은 압수 혹은 停刊 그네의 자유이요 언론기관으로의 자유는 一事一物에 밋지 못하얏다.
그러나 민중의 문화적 進展力은 그럴사록 向上되야 到處에 사상단체가 조직되며 강연회 토론회가 京鄕에서 작구 개최되며 비록 출판법에 의한 것이나마 잡지가 발행되며 하야 己未 이전과는 과연 昔今의 感을 갓게 되야섯다. 이리하야 庚申의 6월에 開闢잡지가 창간되고 又 翌年(壬戌)에는 新生活 新天地 朝鮮之光＜88＞ 東明 등 언론잡지가 重出하야 비록 拘囚의 언론이나마 朝出暮死의 언론이나마 이러구 저러구 떠드러 오든 것이엿다. 中에 新生活은 主義의 嫌으로 발행권이 取消되고 新天地 亦 不穩의 名으로 廢刊을 당하고 朝鮮之光은 近日에 와서 繼刊되고 東明은 昨秋에 廢刊되고 代로 日刊新聞 時代日報가 今年 3월에 출생하얏다.
이리하야 京城에 在한 現今의 朝鮮文 언론기관으로는 東亞日報 朝鮮日報 時代日報 每日申報 등 4종이 잇고 월간잡지로는 開闢이 잇고 週刊의 時事評論 朝鮮之光이 잇슬 뿐이다. 그리고 日本文 기관으로는 京城日報 朝鮮新聞 京城日日 京城新聞 朝鮮每日新聞 등 近 7,8종이 有하다. 그는 朝鮮人과의 特殊別에 在한 것이닛가 여긔에 具說할 필요가 업다. 대강 이만콤 아라두자.＜89＞
