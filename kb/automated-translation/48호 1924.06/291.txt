**Summary**

This short notice from the editors of *Kaebyŏk* magazine announces that five planned articles have been postponed to the next issue due to space constraints. The titles of the postponed articles focus on critiques of consumer cooperatives, exploitative conditions, the state of major cooperatives/unions, the disorientation within the labor movement, and general societal fragmentation. From a historical perspective, this notice is interesting as it reveals the specific socio-economic and political concerns being debated in Korean intellectual circles in 1924, such as the effectiveness of economic self-help organizations (cooperatives), exploitation (likely colonial or capitalist), the state of the labor movement, and broader societal issues under Japanese rule. The titles themselves suggest a critical stance towards the prevailing conditions.
