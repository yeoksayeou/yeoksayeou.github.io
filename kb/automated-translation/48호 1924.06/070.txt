Kyŏngsŏng of 'Its Mandate is Renewal'
Kyŏngsŏng is located at 126 degrees 59 minutes East longitude and 37 degrees 34 minutes North latitude, occupying the central part of the Korean Peninsula, making it the capital (水府) of Chosŏn. Its old names are Hanyang, Hansŏng, or Hwangsŏng. To the north, it is backed by Paegak and Samgaksan mountains, faces Sumyŏksan mountain to the south, and has the peaks of T'araksan mountain to the east and Inwangsan mountain to the west clustered together, forming a natural fortress. The Han River flows majestically to its south, truly making it a land embraced by mountains and rivers. The circumference of the city walls is 9,575 *po* (steps) (4 *ri* 26 *chŏng*), the height is 40 *ch'ŏk* 1 *ch'on*, and eight gates were established: Sungnye to the south, Sukchŏng to the north, Hŭng'in to the east, Tonŭi to the west, Hyehwa to the northeast (In the early Yi Dynasty, this gate was called Honghwa. During King Sŏngjong's reign in the year Kyemyo, the east gate of Ch'anggyŏng Palace was also named Honghwa. Later, because the two gates were confused, it was changed to Hyehwa), Ch'angŭi to the northwest, Kwanghŭi to the southeast, and Soŭi to the southwest. Currently, only Hŭng'in, Sungnye, Ch'angŭi, Hyehwa, and Kwanghŭi gates barely remain; the others have been destroyed and abolished, and the city walls are also mostly dilapidated, making it difficult to see their former appearance.<38>

Speaking of its history, Kyŏngsŏng was originally the land of Mahan. At the time of the founding of the Paekche kingdom by King Onjo, it was incorporated into the Pukhanju administrative district. After Paekche moved its capital south (to Kongju), King Changsu of Koguryŏ took it and called it Namp'yŏngyang. King Chinhŭng of Silla occupied it and called it Sinju, later establishing Pukhanju and Hansanju. King Kyŏngdŏk renamed it Hanyang-gun. In the early Koryŏ period, it was also called Yangju. King Sŏngjong named it Chwasinch'aekkun, and King Munjong promoted it to Namgyŏng. King Ch'ungnyŏl changed it to Hanyang-bu. At the beginning of the Yi Dynasty's founding, King T'aejo adopted the theory of the Royal Preceptor Muhak and designated it as the national capital, establishing the Hansŏng-bu. Since then, it served as the capital of Chosŏn for over 500 years until after the annexation, when it was renamed Kyŏngsŏng-bu, which continues to this day.

The administrative districts were traditionally divided into 5 *sŏ* (wards) and 49 *pang* (precincts): Central Ward with 8 *pang*, East Ward with 12 *pang*, South Ward with 11 *pang*, West Ward with 8 *pang*, and North Ward with 10 *pang*. After the annexation, the old and new areas of Yongsan were annexed into Kyŏngsŏng-bu, which was divided into 186 *chō* (districts) and *dong* (neighborhoods). Its expanse is 1 *ri* 33 *chŏng* from east to west, 3 *ri* 12 *chŏng* from north to south, the area is 2.35 square *ri*, and the circumferential distance is 7 *ri* 26 *chŏng*. <39> The current number of households is: Korean 44,029, Japanese 18,936, Chinese 745, other foreigners 153, for a total of 63,863. The population is: Korean 207,496, Japanese 76,188, Chinese 4,130, others 446, for a total of 288,260.

The climate has a severe difference between heat and cold; the highest temperature during the year is 36.3 degrees Celsius, and the lowest is minus 21 degrees Celsius. The annual amount of rain and snow is 1171.9 mm, which is about 80% compared to Pusan and Wŏnsan, the rainiest regions in the country, and 1.5 times that of Hamgyŏng North Province, the driest region. The maximum amount in one day and night, 355 mm, is incomparable across various regions of Chosŏn and Japan. Throughout the year, the weather includes: snow 26 days, thunder/lightning 16 days, fog 24 days, frost 103 days, clear weather 82 days, cloudy weather 121 days, storms 9 days. The first frost is usually around October 12th, and the first snow around November 3rd. During the winter season, the Han River freezes over, reaching more than a *ch'ŏk* (foot) thick, and snow sometimes reaches over a *ch'ŏk* as well.

Transportation, which was relatively convenient traditionally, has <40> developed even further recently, with flat, smooth main roads like level ground crisscrossing the city streets. Among these, Namdaemun-t'ong, Chongno-t'ong, Kwanghwamun-t'ong, T'aep'yŏng-t'ong, and Hwanggŭm-jŏng-t'ong are the largest roads. There are conveniences of electric trams, automobiles, and various other vehicles everywhere. There are two train stations, Kyŏngsŏng and Yongsan, connecting the Kyŏngbu, Kyŏngŭi, and Kyŏngwŏn lines. Furthermore, there is water transport on the Han River, making it a strategic point for both land and water transport throughout the province.

Regarding education, for educating Koreans, there are public institutions: 1 normal school, 16 common schools, 4 vocational schools; and private institutions: 6 common schools, 5 higher common schools, 3 girls' higher common schools, 2 vocational schools, 2 professional schools, 15 general schools, 17 religious schools, 8 kindergartens, and 97 *sŏdang* (traditional village schools). For Japanese education, there are public: 9 elementary schools, 2 girls' high schools, 2 vocational schools; and private: 7 various schools, 1 vocational school, 3 kindergartens. In addition to these, there are several government-established middle schools and professional schools, and Kyŏngsŏng University first opened this year. (Education will be discussed further in another section). Medical institutions include the Government-General Hospital as the primary one, 1 public hospital, and 23 private hospitals. There are 23 Western-style doctors, 231 traditional practitioners (*ŭisaeng*), 27 dentists, <41> 160 midwives, 291 nurses, 59 pharmacists, and 605 drug sellers. Regarding religion, Christianity, Buddhism, Cheondoism, Sicheongyo, and other religious groups are all present. There are 52 Christian mission posts, 3 Buddhist temples, 1 Cheondoist church, 2 Sicheongyo churches, and 1 Catholic church. Among these, the Cheondoist and Catholic churches are prominent large buildings within Kyŏngsŏng. Furthermore, there is 1 public library and 2 private libraries, holding a total of 63,657 books.

Markets include 5 publicly established food markets, 3 firewood and charcoal markets, 1 livestock market, and 9 privately established markets. The markets inside Namdaemun and at Ihyŏn are traditionally famous ones, with the morning markets being especially bustling. Also, recently, from spring to autumn, night markets are specially set up to buy and sell various goods. Regarding shops, in the past, the government specially established the Six Licensed Stores (*Yukŭijŏn*: drapery, white cotton, silk, blue hemp cloth, ramie cloth, paper) on Chongno, in addition to fish markets and shoe stores (*hyejŏn*). Goods from each province were stored separately, monopoly rights were granted respectively, and groups were formed to supply goods for royal family events like capping ceremonies, weddings, funerals, and ancestral rites. Afterwards, items such as silk and cloth came to be traded freely; these were called *sanjŏn* (unlicensed stores). <42> Furthermore, as a result of the changing times, the notion of merchants being despised was gradually broken down, and the number of general shops increased. The commerce of the formerly prosperous Six Licensed Stores finally met the sad fate of decline.

The number of companies is 249 (including 11 banks), the number of factories is 738, and there are 6 financial cooperatives; these will be discussed in detail in a separate section. Finally, one thing to mention is the military and police situation: there are 6 police stations within the prefecture, 67 police substations; Police Superintendent: 2 Koreans, 9 Japanese; Police Inspector: 34 Japanese, 16 Koreans; Assistant Police Inspector: 54 Japanese, 4 Koreans; Patrolman: 66 Japanese, 497 Koreans; total: 765 Japanese, 519 Koreans (as of April 1923). Military troops include the Chosŏn Infantry unit (320 men), Japanese 78th Infantry Regiment, 79th Infantry Regiment, 28th Cavalry Regiment, 26th Field Artillery Regiment, plus the Garrison Army Command, 20th Division Command, 40th Infantry Brigade Command, Kempeitai Command, Army Warehouse, Army Ordnance Branch Depot, Kyŏngsŏng Kempeitai, Kyŏngsŏng Kempeitai Detachment, Yongsan Kempeitai Detachment, and the Monopoly Bureau. Also, there are 3 fire brigades; Brigade Leader: 1 Korean, 1 Japanese; Squad Leader: 4 Japanese, 2 Koreans; Firefighter: 100 Japanese, 60 Koreans; total: 63 Koreans, 106 Japanese. <43>

**Summary**

This 1924 article provides a detailed overview of Kyŏngsŏng (colonial Seoul), covering its geography, extensive history tracing name changes and administrative roles from ancient times through the Chosŏn Dynasty to the Japanese colonial period, current administrative divisions, demographics (showing significant Japanese and smaller Chinese populations alongside Koreans), climate data, transportation infrastructure (roads, rail, trams, river), educational institutions (segregated by nationality and type), medical facilities, religious presence, markets (including the decline of traditional licensed stores), economic entities (companies, factories, banks), and finally, a breakdown of police and military forces stationed in the city, including personnel numbers by nationality. For historians, the article is valuable for its specific statistics on population, administration, infrastructure, and particularly the detailed listing of Japanese military and police presence alongside Korean personnel numbers, reflecting the structure of colonial rule. The explicit mention of the decline of traditional Korean commerce (*Yukŭijŏn*) juxtaposed with the rise of new systems also offers insight into economic transformations under colonialism.
