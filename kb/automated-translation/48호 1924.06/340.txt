餘言

February, March, April, May—after being suspended for four whole months and suffering a severe ordeal (酷患), my head is truly spinning as if I’d eaten phlegm soup [an idiom implying mental fog/discomfort], and it's unbearably awkward. No matter how much I try to act clear-headed, I actually feel dazed. I want to just stammer for a moment. But I cannot even do that. What is to be done?

From our readers, requests like this arrive: "Hey, please make sure it doesn't get confiscated (押收)! It's a loss for your company (貴社) and a loss for the readers, so what use is a double loss (一擧兩失)? Please be careful and try not to get confiscated (押收). Well, a few times a year is one thing, but four months in a row—what is going on? The authorities (當局) are the authorities, but still..."

We know it is a thankful request. It is true that it is a loss (損) for our company (本社) and a loss for the readers. We clearly know both sides suffer loss (損). But what can we do? It is certainly not intentional (故意). To a third party, it may seem as if only we are foolish (愚). Indeed, it is an awkward situation. We ask for the readers' understanding (諒解).

As previously announced, this issue has been edited as the Kyŏngsŏng (京城) Issue. Just as Kyŏngsŏng is originally (原體) the capital (首府) of Chosŏn (朝鮮), there is much material worthy of being featured for Chosŏn. We tried to gather from various fields and introduce various aspects, but there is still much dissatisfaction. Points left incomplete (不備의 點) will inevitably have to be added (添載) to the July commemorative issue. We are especially grateful to the many people who sent in their valuable manuscripts (玉稿) despite their busy schedules for this issue.

The upcoming July issue is the 4th Anniversary Commemorative Issue of this magazine (本誌). Of course, it will be a special large issue. Notably, the announcement (發布) of the prize-winning literary works (懸賞文藝) will be included. Let us wait and see what content it will make its appearance (出世) with.

The names (氏名) of the prize winners (當選人) for the literary contest (懸賞文藝) were supposed to be announced in this June issue, but due to the circumstances of the judges (選者), it has been decided they will be announced (發布) along with the original texts (原文) in the July issue. We request the understanding (諒解) of the contributors (投稿者 氏).

**Summary**

This editorial postscript from *Kaebyŏk* magazine apologizes for a four-month suspension, described euphemistically as a "severe ordeal" (酷患), likely referring to government censorship and confiscation (押收). The editors acknowledge reader frustration about the frequent confiscations, which harm both the publisher and the readership, but state it's not intentional and ask for understanding. They introduce the current issue focusing on Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul), thank contributors, and announce the upcoming 4th-anniversary issue in July, which will include the delayed results of a literary contest. The repeated references to "confiscation" (押收) and the difficult position implied when mentioning "the authorities" (當局) are particularly revealing. Historians would find this direct commentary on censorship and publishing difficulties valuable for understanding the constraints faced by the Korean press under Japanese colonial rule.
