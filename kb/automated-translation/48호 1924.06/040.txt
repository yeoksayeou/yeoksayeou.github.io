天玄地黃 (Heaven is Black, Earth is Yellow)

Regarding the so-called Alliance of Various Factions' Volunteers (所謂 各派有志聯盟會), it's said that intense friction arose among members because only a few executives were exclusively consuming some bundle coming from somewhere. During a public hall lecture meeting, Ko Ŭi-jun reportedly spoke only of the National Association's (國民協會) principles without mentioning the so-called Alliance's Three Principles (三綱領), sparking rebuttal and leading to another major conflict. Originally, an alliance is formed to link lives (連命), so fighting over food like starving dogs is perhaps natural, but whether it's a dog covered in dung or a dog covered in bran, they are essentially the same. Is there really any need to fight so much over the Three Principles versus the National Association's principles?

The Bar Association (辯護士協會), after making a fuss with some resolution and protest regarding the issue of Pak Ch'un-gŭm the other day, merely created material for page three newspaper articles, and then there was no further news. Recently, regarding the Hŭich'ŏn Police Station Torture Incident (熙川警察署 拷問事件), they passed resolutions on various points and reportedly even proposed to the authorities the swift revision or abolition of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance (刑事令). Judging by words alone, it sounds truly admirable, but what can be done when there is little execution? Since they are essentially a band of windbags (法螺패) who make a living by selling only their mouths, there's perhaps no need to say much, but for matters where even a retainer fee (着手金) isn't generated, if they aren't going to execute them, it seems better not to undertake them from the start (of course, how good would it be if they thoroughly executed them!).

Perhaps because there hasn't been much happening in P'yŏngyang recently, various organizations have united and are clamoring about punishment or expulsion regarding the adultery case (간통사건) of the Tōa [Ilbo] Branch Chief, Mr. Kim Hyŏng-sik. (Think about it, the moment the news of the alleged adultery became known to the world, Kim had already received his punishment.) If Mr. Kim had merely committed consensual adultery (和姦), it's like this, but if he had committed rape (强姦), a citizens' rally would likely have been held in P'yŏngyang. However, regarding Mr. Kim, and also Mr. Yi Tŏk-hwan, despite his advanced age, he used his position as an elder and the power of money to enter into an unsuitable marriage with a woman of youthful beauty (妙齡) young enough to be his granddaughter several times over. Suffering such humiliation is, so to speak, sowing beans and reaping beans (種豆得豆).

Hwimun High Common School (徽文高普), whose eyes were red with the hunt for championship flags (優勝旗獵取) and only pursued sports, suffered a crushing defeat in the recent baseball tournament, having completely neglected sports after public opinion arose last autumn due to the illegal player incident (不正選手事件). Originally, if they had focused on education as the foundation and engaged in sports appropriately, things would have gone well without any controversy. But after acting out of momentary bravado, they retreated again and completely forgot about sports. Can this be called a proper educational method? From this, it is clear that their previous emphasis on sports was truly not for the physical education of the students.

Minister Min Yŏng-gi (閔泳綺男) of the Office of the Yi Royal Household (李王職) received a resolution from the reporters' corps due to his blunder <33> towards the journalists covering the office. His eyes wide like someone using Daigaku eye drops (大學目藥), he even apologized and, as an appeasement strategy, connected with certain reporters. The Yi Wangjik officials and reporters joined together to organize the so-called "Yi Hwa Club" (李花俱樂部). Since government and people have truly become one (官民一致), if they manage governance reform well, perhaps incidents of corruption in the Yi Wangjik will decrease significantly in the future.

Governor-General Saitō (齊藤總督), while conducting a border inspection intending to report on Chōsen's peace and stability (平穩無事) at the upcoming Diet session, was targeted in an ambush (狙擊) by an Independence Group (獨立團). Fortunately, he was unharmed, so there's room to argue it doesn't matter even if there are insubordinate Koreans (不逞鮮人), but the explanation will be somewhat awkward (窘塞). Meanwhile, the Administrative Superintendent (政務總監) reportedly negotiated with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and had the Japanese Consul General in Fengtian (奉天) lodge a formal protest with the Chinese authorities (中國 官憲). Instead of protesting indirectly to China, wouldn't it have been more convenient to negotiate directly with the XX Army [Independence Army] and ask them, even if they normally infiltrate, to please refrain from ambushes during border inspections specifically when the Diet is in session?

Mr. Sun Wen (孫文氏), who was rumored to have passed away, is alive and well with clear blue eyes, and reportedly issued an expulsion order to a Reuters correspondent for spreading rumors. If the Guangdong government intends to join hands with the Worker-Peasant government (勞農정부) and proceed under the same ideology, it's natural for Mr. Sun Wen, like Mr. Lenin (레린 氏), to die and come back to life several times. But why expel the correspondent?

The Russian consul residing in Britain reportedly submitted a permit request to the British government to transfer Mr. Marx's (맑스氏) grave to Moscow (莫府). If one adopts Marx's ideology, adopt it; what relevance do the withered bones in the grave (塚中의 枯骨) have? Extrapolating from this, perhaps in the future, if Leninism spreads throughout the world, another world war might arise over the issue of Lenin's reburial (移葬).

Kikuchi (菊池), the Commander of the Chōsen Army, on his way to Japan this time, told a certain newspaper reporter, "There is still room to transplant 20 million mainlanders (內地人) into Chōsen," and also said, "Chōsen people have mouths and cunning, but no soul (魂), and the problem is the infiltration of insubordinate Koreans (不逞鮮人), but with one command, there is no Yalu River nor border, thus the insubordinate rat-thieves (不逞鼠賊) are nothing to worry about," thus revealing the true intentions of his ilk (彼輦 一流). Right, so you're saying that in the land of Chōsen, where 20 million currently live, 20 million Japanese people can be transplanted? Never mind 20 million, even 50 million, if you can do it, go ahead. You soldier boy, saying there's no border or anything with just one command, isn't there no need to make a fuss with just your mouth? However, Mr. Kikuchi, this reporter is also one of the Chōsen people who possess only a mouth. Let me first ask you one word: "Really, are Chōsen people the only ones who possess only mouths but lack souls? How about you people these days? And first, how about yourself?" <34>
<33-34>

**Summary**

This article from the June 1924 issue of *Kaebyŏk* magazine presents a series of short, critical commentaries on contemporary events and figures in colonial Korea and abroad. It touches upon internal strife within Korean political groups, the perceived inaction of the Korean Bar Association, a social scandal involving a newspaper chief in P'yŏngyang, criticism of a school's fickle approach to sports, the appeasement of journalists by a high official of the former royal household, the attempted assassination of Governor-General Saitō, rumors surrounding Sun Yat-sen, a Soviet proposal to move Marx's grave, and culminates in a sharp rebuke of Japanese military commander Kikuchi's derogatory remarks about Koreans and Japanese colonial ambitions. The piece reveals intense social friction, disillusionment with various organizations, and simmering resentment against Japanese colonial rule and rhetoric. Historians might find valuable insights into the internal dynamics of Korean society under colonial rule, public discourse on scandals and political events, Korean reactions to Japanese colonial policies and attitudes, and the specific viewpoints expressed in *Kaebyŏk*, a significant nationalist magazine of the era. The critique of Commander Kikuchi's statements offers a particularly stark example of Korean intellectual resistance to colonial denigration.

天玄地黃
所謂 各派有志聯盟會는 某處에서 오는 무슨 뭉치를 幾個 간부만 獨食한다고 회원간에 軋轢이 심하던 중 公會堂 강연회에 高義駿이가 그 所謂 聯盟會의 三綱領은 말하지 안코 國民協會主旨만을 말하얏다고 반박이 생겨 一大爭鬪을 또 하얏다나. 원래 聯盟이라는 것은 連命하기 위하야 생긴 것이닛가 飢狗의 爭食格으로 밥을 위하야 쟁투하는 것은 당연하다만은 똥 무든 개나, 계 무든 개가 其實은 일반인즉 三綱領과 國民協會 主旨를 가지고 그다지 싸울 것이 느 잇너냐 말이다.

辯護士協會에서는 前日에 朴春琴의 문제로 무즌 決議 무슨 抗議하고 뒤떠드러 신문 3면 기사 재료만 맨들고 아모 소식이 업더니 近日에 또 熙川警察署 拷問事件으로 여러 가지 條項을 결의하고 刑事令改廢 단행까지도 당국에 건의한다 云한다. 말만 드러서는 참 훌륭하다만은 實行이 적은 데야 엇지 하리오. 원래 입만 팔러 먹고사는 法螺패들이닛가 별로 말할 필요도 업지만 着手金도 안이 생기는 일에야 實行치 안니하랴거던 당초부터 착수도 안이함이 조흘 듯(물론 철저히 실행하면 오즉 됴흘가)

平壤은 近日에 그다지 일들도 업는지 東亞支局長 金瀅植 君의 간통사건으로 某某단체가 연합하야 討罪니 除名이니 하고 떠든다.(생각하라, 간통햇다는 그 말이 세상에 알녀진 순간, 金은 벌서 바들 罰을 바든 것이다) 金君이 和姦이나 하얏게 그럿치 만일 强姦을 하얏더면 平壤의 시민대회를 열엇슬 것이다. 然而 金君도 金君이어니와 李德煥 君도 老齡임을 불구하고 長老의 지위와 금전의 세력을 가지고 딸로도 몃재 딸이나 될만한 妙齡의 여자와 不相應한 결혼을 하얏스니 이러한 치욕을 당하는 것도 말하면 種豆得豆.

優勝旗獵取에 두 눈이 빨개서 운동만 일삼던 徽文高普는 昨秋 不正選手事件으로 사회에 여론이 잇슨 후로 아주 운동을 힘쓰지 안이하야 今般 야구대회에 대참패를 당하얏다. 본래 교육을 本位로 삼어 운동을 적당하게 하얏스면 아모 是非도 업시 잘 될 것인데 일시적 호기심으로 하다가 또 退縮되야 운동을 아주 忘却하니 이것이 상당한 교육의 방법이라할가. 이로 보면 前日에 운동을 힘쓴 것이 참으로 학생의 체육을 위하지 안은 것은 분명.

李王職 長官 閔泳綺男은 同職 출입기자에게 失態한＜33＞ 관계로 기자단의 결의서를 밧고 大學目藥의 눈이 휘둥구래서 謝過까지 하고 懷柔策으로 某某기자와 연결하야 李王職 관리와 기자가 합동하야 所謂 李花俱樂部를 조직하얏다. 그야말로 官民一致가 되얏스닛가 施政改善을 잘하고 보면 今後 李玉職은 아주 不正事件이 감소될 듯.

齊藤總督은 今般 議會에 가서 朝鮮의 平穩無事를 보고하랴고 國境視察을 하다가 獨立團에게 狙擊을 당하얏다. 다행히 無事는 하얏스닛가 不逞鮮人이 잇서도 無關이라고 변명할 여지는 잇지만은 말이 좀 窘塞할 것이다. 그런데 政務總監은 外務省과 교섭하야 奉天에 在한 日本總領事로  中國 官憲에게 정식항의를 하얏다한다. 간접으로 中國에 항의하지 말고 직접 XX軍에게 교섭하야 평소는 침입하더라도 제발 議會 臨時에 국경 시찰 중에는 저격하지 말나고 하얏스면 더 편리할 듯.

逝去하얏다던 孫文氏는 두 눈이 새파랏케 살아서 路透通信員에게 風說을 전하얏다고 추방명령을 하얏다 한다. 廣東정부가 勞農정부와 握手하야 가튼 主義로 나아가랴면 孫文氏도 레린 氏처럼 몃벅식 죽어다 살어다 하는 것이 당연한 일인데 통신기자를 추방하는 것은 何故.

英國在留露國領事는 맑스氏 墳墓를 莫府에 移葬하겟다고 許可願을 英政府에 제출하얏다 한다. 맑스의 主義를 취하면 취하얏지 塚中의 枯骨이 何關인가. 이로 미러보면 장래 레린主義가 세계에 선전되면 레린의 移葬문제로 세계대전쟁이 또 생길지도 不知.

菊池朝鮮軍司令官은 今番渡日路中에 某 신문기자에게 「朝鮮에는 아즉도 內地人 2천만을 移植할 수가 잇다」하고, 또 가로되 「朝鮮사람은 입과 꾀는 잇스나 魂은 업고, 문제는 不逞鮮人의 침입이나, 한 號令이면 鴨江도 國境도 업는 것인 즉, 不逞鼠賊은 근심할 바가 업다 하야, 彼輦 一流의 本心을 說盡하엿다. 올치 그러면 지금 2천만이 사는 朝鮮江山에 2천만의 日本사람을 移植할 수가 잇다는 말이지, 2천만은 그만 두고 5천만이라도 할 수만 잇거든 하렴으나. 한 號令이면 국경도 무엇도 업다는 이 兵丁아, 입만 가지고 야단칠 필요는 업는 것이 아니냐. 그러나 菊池君, 기자도 입만 가진 朝鮮사람인 하나이라. 그대에게 爲先 한 마듸 말을 물을지니 「그래, 입만 가지고 魂을 못 가진 사람이 朝鮮사람뿐이더냐. 요새의 너희는 엇더며, 爲先 너는 엇더하냐」＜34＞
＜33-34＞
