Chinju Small Talk

With hearts like a lighthouse on the ocean, citizens entrust their beloved children without doubt, trusting that he, a certain instructor (訓導 某) at Chinju OO Common School (晋州 OO普校), will teach several hundred students and cultivate their future talents (雄才大略). However, after finishing his hours, instead of researching materials for tomorrow's lessons, he reportedly pulls his hat down low and specializes in visiting *kisaeng* houses until late at night. What then does he intend to teach the students? If this is true, his sins against his position as an educator and against society are indeed sins, but the dreamy indifference and irresponsible attitude of the educational authorities (學務當局), school board members (學務委員 諸氏), and esteemed parents (학부형 諸賢) cannot but elicit a laugh. While there is absolutely no reason to cultivate such educators, knowing that their existence in our society is harmful and without benefit, oh authorities and parents! How about rousing yourselves quickly and delivering a blow (一棒)?

Whether it's the corruption of Chinju society or the deterioration of the legal circles, I do not know, but the recent behavior of lawyers is unbearable to even look at, making one's eyes water and smelling foul (of course, not all are like this, presumably). They fail to perform their grave and important duties, such as clarifying legal principles to protect civil rights among the populace and entering the legal world to warn against and correct the misconduct of law enforcers (執法者). Instead, using the fine name of lawyer, their tyranny (橫暴) and abuse of power (濫權) against the public grow worse by the day. For example, if one uses someone's property and is asked for payment, their typical stubborn response is, "If you intend to receive it, get a payment order or file a lawsuit." And yet, they reportedly change color and become enraged if not addressed as "Your Excellency" (令監). How laughable! That fostering and protecting such habits is anything but the corruption of Chinju's notable figures, what else could it be?

I don't know if a new ordinance was recently promulgated under the Gambling Control Law (賭博取締法) stating that gambling by lawyers is not subject to crackdown, but looking closely, while the gambling of weak (殘弱) and ignorant (愚昧) common folk—like playing for a few dozen *chŏn* over cold noodles or cigarettes when bored—gets them caught and fined or sentenced to months of prison labor if spotted, perhaps the authorities are intimidated and cannot crack down on those with status, reputation, and who have glanced at law books to become lawyers, or perhaps they respect their character. In any case, these lawyers apparently gamble for scores of *wŏn*, even transferring debt claims when cash runs short. It seems they even get indicted at the Court Branch Office (法院支廳). However, seeing that the authorities pay no mind to such matters, one cannot distinguish the truth or falsehood of the law, and at the same time, cannot help but doubt the authorities. Since they understand the law and deliberately engage in such behavior, isn't their crime far greater than that of the poor folk (殘民) who act out of ignorance?! How utterly deplorable. <102>

**Summary**

This article from 1923 sharply criticizes the perceived moral decline among certain elite figures in Chinju (晋州). It first condemns a common school teacher for neglecting his educational duties in favor of frequenting *kisaeng* houses late at night. It then broadens its critique to lawyers in the city, accusing them of arrogance, abusing their authority for personal gain, refusing to pay debts, and engaging in high-stakes gambling, seemingly with impunity. The author contrasts the lack of enforcement against these lawyers with the harsh punishment meted out to common people for minor gambling offenses, questioning the fairness of the legal system and the competence or integrity of the authorities. For historians, this piece offers a glimpse into social criticism during the colonial period, highlighting concerns about the conduct of educated elites (teachers, lawyers), perceived hypocrisy and inequality in the application of law under Japanese rule, and the moral anxieties within a provincial Korean city. The specific complaints about lawyers' arrogance and impunity, alongside the teacher's dereliction of duty, paint a picture of social tension and disillusionment.

晋州小言
海洋의 燈臺가티 잇는 맘으로 시민들은 一縲囑望을 가지고 사랑하는 자녀를 의심업시 막기고, 자기 역시 數百名의 生徒를 가르켜 그들로 하여곰 장래의 雄才大略을 양성하겻다는 晋州 OO普校 訓導 某는, 시간을 맛친 후 학교를 나와서는 明日의 敎材를 연구하기커녕 모자를 눌너쓰고 夜深토록 기생집 차저 단이기에 專攻을 한다나. 그러면 학생에게 무얼 가르키자는 말인가. 然하다 하면 교육자 된 그 身勢와 사회에 대한 죄악도 죄악이려니와, 學務當局이나 學務委員 諸氏나 학부형 諸賢의 夢醉中等閑 無責任한 태도는 一笑하지 안을 수 업다. 이러한 교육자를 양성할 理도 萬無하지만, 이것이 우리사회에 존재함이 有害無益임을 안 이상은, 당국이나 학부형이여! 하로밧비 奮起하야 一棒을 내림이 如何.

晋州사회 부패인지 법조계의 악화인지는 모르나, 근래 변호사들의 行態는 보기만 하여도 눈이 시고 구린내가 나서 못견댈 지경(물론 다 그런 것은 아니겟지)이다. 법리를 硏明하야써 민간에 잇서 인권을 보호하며 法界에 入하야 執法者의 非行을 警告 促酲하는 등, 자기의 重且大한 의무는 행하지 안이하고 변호사란 美名을 이용하야 민간에 대한 橫暴와 濫權은 去益日甚, 例하면 人의 物을 引用하고 대가를 청구하면 「바들 의사가 잇거든 지불명령을 하던지 청구소송을 하던지 하오」하는 등, 뱃심 불이기가 주장의 버릇이다. 그러고도 言必稱 令監이라고 안으면 變色憤怒한다지, 可笑可笑, 이런 習을 養하며 護함이 모다 晋州인사의 부패가 안이고 무엇일가?

賭博取締法에 변호사들의 도박하는 것은 取締를 안는다는 新法令이 근일 發布되엿는지는 모르나, 가만히 보면 殘弱하고 愚昧한 백성들의 심심하면 몃 십전식 놋코 냉면이나 卷煙내기 가튼 노름은 눈에 띄이기만 하면 붓들어다 벌금 안이면 몃 개월식 형무소 머슴살이를 식히면서 地位잇고 名望을 가지고 법률책 페-지나 본 뒤에 변호사노릇을 하닛가 㥘이 나서 取締를 못하는지, 또는 그들의 인격을 중시함인지는 모르거니와, 그들은 바로 數十圓식을 놋코 하다가 현금이 모자라면 債權讓渡까지 하는 모양이다. 그리다가 法院支廳에 起訴까지 당하고 하는 모양이다. 그러나 이런 일은 당국에서 알은 체도 안이함을 보면 법률의 眞假를 分揀할 수 업는 동시에 당국을 의심 안을 수 업다. 그들이 법률을 이해하면서 일부러 그런 행동을 취함은 전혀 모르고 한 殘民들의 그것보다는 죄가 훨신 크지 안을가?! 痛可快.＜102＞
