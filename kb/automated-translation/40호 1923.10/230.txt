素月 (Sowŏl)
朔州 龜城 (Sakchu Kusŏng)

Three days by water, three days by boat
A distant three thousand *ri*
Moreover, a distant three thousand *ri* walking over
Sakchu Kusŏng is six thousand *ri* beyond the mountains.

Even the swallow, soaked completely by the water,
Gets caught in the rain on its way and comes back.
In the evening, a high mountain
At night, a high mountain.

Sakchu Kusŏng is beyond the mountains
A distant six thousand *ri*
Now and then, in dreams, four or five thousand *ri*
It must be the road of going, coming, and returning.

Because we are bodies parted, my body yearns
Because it's where my beloved is, the place is yearned for
Haven't you seen? Even the birds, yearning for home,
Do they not come and go, north and south? <140>

The cloud flying at the edge of the field,
Where straight might its heart have gone?
Sakchu Kusŏng is beyond the mountains
A distant six thousand *ri*.

가는 길 (The Road Taken)

I long for it
Shall I say the words?
Because I long for it so

Shall I just go?
Even so
Just one more time again

On that mountain too, crows; in the field, crows
On Sŏsan (West Mountain), they say the sun is setting
They are cawing.

Apkang (Front River) water, Twikkang (Rear River) water
The flowing water
Saying 'follow quickly,' 'let's follow'
Even flowing, it flows on and on. <141>

山 (Mountain)

Even the mountain bird, on the alder tree
Sings from above.
Why does the mountain bird sing? In the deep mountain valley
To cross the pass, that's why it sings.

Snow falls, comes and covers.
Today's journey too, is one day's path
Seventy or eighty *ri*.
Having turned back, sixty *ri* were also traveled.

No return, no return, again no return
To Samsu Kapsan, again no return.
Though a man's heart might forget,
The affection of fifteen years cannot be forgotten.

Snow that comes on the mountain, snow that melts in the field.
Even the mountain bird, on the alder tree
Sings from above.
The road to Samsu Kapsan is a mountain pass road. <142>

**Summary**

These three poems by Kim Sowŏl explore themes of immense distance, longing, and arduous journeys, likely reflecting feelings of separation from a loved one or a homeland. The first poem, "Sakchu Kusŏng," emphasizes the vast, almost insurmountable distance (six thousand *ri*) separating the speaker from the titular place, a distance traversable only sometimes in dreams. The second, "The Road Taken," conveys hesitation and the pull of memory against the backdrop of nature urging movement forward. The third, "Mountain," depicts a difficult journey through snow-covered mountains, possibly symbolizing exile or inescapable hardship, referencing the remote Samsu Kapsan region and unforgettable memories. From the perspective of Korean colonial history, these poems resonate deeply with the sense of displacement, loss, and yearning experienced by many Koreans during that period. The depiction of vast distances, difficult travel, and longing for reunion or return could be interpreted by historians as reflecting the emotional landscape shaped by political realities, separation from the homeland (whether physically or emotionally), and the hardships of life under colonial rule, even without explicit political statements.

素月
朔州 龜城

물로 사흘 배 사흘
먼 三千里
더더구나 거러 넘는 먼 三千里
朔州龜城은 山을 넘은 六千里요.

물마저 함빡히 저즌 제비도
가다가 비에 걸녀 오노랍니다.
져녁에는 놉픈 山
밤에 놉픈 山.

朔州龜城은 산넘어
먼 六千里
각금 각금 꿈에는 四五千里
가다오다 도라오는 길이겟지오.

서로 떠난 몸이길내 몸이 그려워
님게신 곳이길내 곳이 그려워
못 보앗소 새들도 집이 그려워
南北으로 오고가고 안이합듸까.＜140＞

들끗테 나라가는 나는 구룸은
맘쯤은 어듸바루 가 잇슬텐고.
朔州龜城은 山넘어
먼 六千里.

가는 길

그렵다
말을 할까
하니 그려워

그냥 갈까
그래도
다시  더 한번

져 山에도 가마귀, 들에 가마귀
西山에는 해진다고
지저귑니다.

압江물 뒷江물
흐르는 물은
어서 따라오라고 따라가쟈고
흘너도 년다라 흐릅듸다려.＜141＞

山

山새도 오리나무
우헤서 운다.
山새는 왜 우노, 시매산골
嶺 넘어 갈나고 그래서 울지.

눈은 나리네, 와서 덥피네.
오늘도 하룻길은
七八十里.
도라섯서 六十里는 가기도 햇소.

不歸 不歸 다시 不歸
三水甲山에 다시 不歸.
사나희 속이라 니즈련만
十五年든 정을 못닛겟네.

山에는 오는 눈, 들에는 녹는 눈.
山새도 오리나무
우헤서 운다.
三水甲山 가는 길은 고개의 길.＜142＞
＜140-142＞
