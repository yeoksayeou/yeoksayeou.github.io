Ch'ŏrwŏn Miscellany (To the Tokyo Overseas Students Friendship Association Lecture Group, especially the speakers who came to Ch'ŏrwŏn)
						Yŏnjae from Ch'ŏrwŏn

Though I am merely a young man from a rural village, buried in the countryside and lacking any particular insight, I cannot suppress my indignation and sorrow at your late-night conduct (*夜行動). Thus, I take up my pen to offer a word of counsel, however inadequate it may be. I trust you will fully understand any disorder in my words, and furthermore, I hope you will examine the details of your actions and respond if there is even the slightest inaccuracy in my account.

It was the tenth day of this past August. That is to say, it was the day your esteemed association (貴會) was scheduled to hold a lecture meeting at the Ch'ŏrwŏn Youth Hall (鐵原靑年會舘). The advertisement stated that the lecture topics and speakers were yet to be decided, and the designated time was nine o'clock in the evening. The audience, thirsty for knowledge and unenlightened (though not all, certainly most) about the currents of the time (時代思潮), gathered in large numbers. Looking around the hall, there was no shadow of the speakers, only a couple of dim lamps (燈火) hanging there. How frustrating it must have been! As time ticked by moment by moment (刻一刻), nine o'clock passed and it neared ten. The vast majority of the audience left, leaving behind only sharp rebukes (一聲唾罵). The remaining seventy or eighty people still waited, hoping against hope for the speakers to take the podium (登壇). However, the speakers only set foot in the hall after ten o'clock. How glad the remaining audience must have been! Having finally arrived, whether your speeches were ready or not, whether you were prepared or not, if you truly had sincerity, the proper course would have been to say whatever you had to say and conclude the meeting. Instead, speaking with the organizer, you claimed that you had never spoken to such a small audience. Considering your knowledge is that of students still in the learning stage, and your lectures are also those of students still learning, to use the small size of the audience as a pretext (憑藉고) to cancel the lecture meeting – was it truly because the audience was small, or was it because you lacked sincerity? Whatever the case, do you perceive ten o'clock as nine o'clock, or as before nine o'clock? If so, perhaps it's understandable, but if not (不然이면), is this not your mistake? Think about it. Do you not realize that because of you, over a hundred, nearly several hundred people wasted precious time, even if only for mere tens of minutes each? Is not this behavior of yours clearly a disregard for the people of Ch'ŏrwŏn (鐵原人士)?

You people! The populace is still not awakened, and our path ahead is still bleak. What have we to rely on? Is it not solely single-minded sincerity and effort (斷斷無他의 성심노력)? And yet, what is this conduct of yours? We want to weep, truly we do. I dare to utter these words to beg your reconsideration (再考).<103>

**Summary**

The author, Yŏnjae from Ch'ŏrwŏn, admonishes a group of Korean students from Tokyo who were scheduled to give a public lecture. They arrived over an hour late, by which time most of the large audience had left in frustration. The students then refused to speak to the remaining attendees, citing the small audience size as unprecedented for them. Yŏnjae criticizes their lack of sincerity, punctuality, and respect for the local people, emphasizing the need for dedicated effort from the educated youth during a difficult time for the nation. For historians, this article offers a valuable glimpse into the relationship between urban-based, educated elites (even students) and rural communities in colonial Korea. It highlights tensions, expectations placed on intellectuals for national enlightenment, and local frustrations with perceived arrogance or lack of commitment from those expected to lead, providing insight into social dynamics and the challenges of nationalist or educational movements at the grassroots level.

鐵原雜信 (東京留學生 學友會 講演團, 특히 鐵原오셧든 演士에게)
						鐵原에서 淵齋
나는 本히 농촌에 뭇친 者로셔 아모런 識見이 업는 한 지방청년에 지나지 못하나 君 等의 *夜行動에 奮慨와 悲哀가 업지 못하야 되지못한 말이나마 一言으로 忠告코저 하여 붓을 드노니 언어에 先後 倒錯은 물론 君 等이 十分 諒解할 줄로 미드며 아울너 君 等에 행동한 것과 劣許라도 틀님이 잇거든 자세히 본 후에 응답하기를 바란다.

지나간 八月 열흘날이엿다, 즉 말하자면 貴會에서 鐵原靑年會舘에 강연회를 개최 한다는 날이다. 광고에 演題 及 演士 未定이라 하엿고, 定刻은 오후 九時라 하엿다. 지식에 목마르고 時代思潮에 어두운(전부는 아니지만 대개난) 청중은 다수이 會集하엿섯다. 회장을 돌아보니, 演士는 그림자도 업고 쇠잔한 燈火만 두어 개 달려 잇슬 뿐이다. 얼마나 답답하엿겟소, 刻一刻 가는 시간은 九時가 지나 十時에 近하매, 청중의 다대수는 一聲唾罵만 남겨두고 돌아가고, 其 外 七八十名은 그래도 幸혀라는 마음으로 演士의 登壇만 고대하엿다. 그런대 연사는 十時가 지나셔야 비로소 발길을 회장에 들여 노앗다. 나마잇든 청중은 얼마나 반가웟겟소. 이왕 발을 들여 노앗스면 말이 되엿던지 아니 되엿던지, 준비가 되엿던지, 아니 되엿던지, 진실로 성의가 잇섯다 하면, 무슨 말이나마 할 바를 다하고 閉會하는 것이 당연하거늘, 사회자로 더부러 말하기를, 이런 소수의 청중에게는 말하여 본 적이 업다고 하니, 君 等의 지식으로 말하면 배우는 시대에 지식이요, 君 等의 講演이라는 것도 역시 배우는 시대의 講演이거늘, 청중의 소수를 憑藉고 강연회을 해산하니, 사실 청중이 적어서 그러함인가, 아니 성의가 업서서 그리함인가. 如何튼지 당신들은 十時를 九時로 아는가, 九時前으로 아는가, 그러타하면 모르거니와 不然이면 君 等의 잘못이 아닌가. 생각하여 보라. 君 等으로 인하여 百餘名 近於 數百名이 單數 十分間 式이라도 空費됨을 모르는가. 君 等의 이러한 행동은 확실히 鐵原人士를 무시함이 아닌가.
당신들아, 민중은 오히려 깨지못하고, 우리의 압길은 여전히 참담한데 우리의 미들 바가 무엇이랴, 다 斷斷無他의 성심노력- 그 한가지가 아닐가. 그런대 당신들의 행동이 그 무슨 일이오. 우리는 울고 십흐다, 졍말로 그러하다. 감히 一言을 發하야 당신네의 再考를 乞한다.＜103＞
