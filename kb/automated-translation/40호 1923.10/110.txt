A Letter to Chang Ping-lin (Upon Re-entering China in the Late Winter of Kyech'uk [1913/early 1914])
						By Kokmyŏng

Heaven’s calamity upon Kija’s domain (箕域)! It has caused us to no longer have a country. Four years have already passed since then. The children of its remaining people cannot live in peace; scattered like stars and flying like hail, they have dispersed in all directions, not without reason. One cannot associate with jackals and wolves (豺狼); miserably, as if unable to endure the day—such feelings are not difficult to understand. Although I wished to suppress my heart, swallow my breath, and strive to separate myself from the ranks of the scattered and dispersed, could I succeed? Considering the vastness of the world, why should one cherish different races and kinds? This is why I did not go to Britain, Germany, France, or America, nor to Russia in the north, nor to the islands of the South Seas, but inevitably came to this central state and people’s country (中州民邦), intending to become an unregistered commoner and eventually find a place to perish.

However, my coming here was not merely for idleness. Residing here, I wish to see its major towns and great cities, to broaden my knowledge. Furthermore, I desire to meet its wise heroes and elders, to expand my capacity. In viewing things, I wish to exhaust their grandeur and beauty; in expressing myself, I wish to be grand and unrestrained. Otherwise, I fear that what I hold within me will ultimately be buried and extinguished, never to be known. Yet, if planning solely for myself, perhaps it would not come to this. Secretly, I wish to make some small contribution to this group of people [the Chinese], thus excessive humility would also be improper. Having survived a great calamity and now arrived in this land, living according to my lot, with light drink and meager food, barely sustaining my pulse, is indeed my situation; indeed, it is fitting. Why then are my current hopes so extravagant? Truly, it is because if not so, I cannot gouge out my accumulated vexations and absorb the new light. Furthermore, it is said that the way to exert utmost sincerity towards China also lies in nothing other than this.

I have long heard of your great name, Sir, and always held you in esteem. Recently, I fortunately had the honor of meeting you face to face, but as the gathering was crowded at that time, I could not express myself fully in the rush. Therefore, I use this letter to convey my thoughts instead. I hope, Sir, that you will understand my feelings, perceive my inner thoughts, generously forgive my presumption, and offer guidance.

**Summary**

This article is a letter written by an author with the pen name Kokmyŏng (likely a Korean exile) to the prominent Chinese scholar and revolutionary Chang Ping-lin. Writing in late 1913 or early 1914 upon re-entering China after Korea's annexation ("Heaven's calamity"), the author laments the loss of their homeland and the scattering of its people. They explain their choice to come to China over other potential destinations, expressing a desire to broaden their horizons, learn from Chinese intellectuals like Chang Ping-lin, and find a way to express their own ideas before they are lost. While resigned to a life of hardship as a stateless person ("unregistered commoner"), the author hopes to make a small contribution to China and seeks Chang Ping-lin's understanding and guidance.

For historians, this letter offers a poignant glimpse into the mindset of a Korean intellectual exile shortly after the loss of national sovereignty. It highlights the profound sense of displacement, the search for refuge and intellectual community in China, the complex feelings towards their host country (respect mixed with a sense of being an outsider), and the desperate hope to preserve and develop their own thoughts and potentially contribute, even in exile. The choice of China as a destination, framed as distinct from Western powers or Southeast Asia, and the deference shown to a figure like Chang Ping-lin, illuminate the specific political and intellectual currents influencing Korean exiles during this period. The use of classical Chinese (Hanmun) underscores the shared literary tradition used for formal communication among East Asian intellectuals.
