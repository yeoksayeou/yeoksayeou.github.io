The October issue has been confiscated again. We dislike saying this or that about it. After deleting all of "To Our Japanese Brothers [日本人 諸兄에게]," "Before Us Lie Two Paths [우리의 압헤는 두 갈내의 길이 잇슴니다]," "Escaping Quake-stricken Tokyo [震亂의 東京을 脫出하야]," and a portion of "Japan and the Japanese Amidst the Quake Chaos [震亂 中의 日本 及 日本人]," we are publishing a special issue [臨時號]. We are not without the thought of wanting to insert several new articles, but due to time constraints [日時의 關係], we cannot do that either.

**Summary**

The editorial department of Kaebyŏk magazine announces that their October 1923 issue (No. 40) has been confiscated by authorities. They state their reluctance to elaborate further. Due to the confiscation, they were forced to remove several articles entirely—"To Our Japanese Brothers," "Before Us Lie Two Paths," "Escaping Quake-stricken Tokyo"—and part of another article, "Japan and the Japanese Amidst the Quake Chaos." A special, temporary issue is being published with the remaining content, as time constraints prevent adding new material. This notice highlights the strict censorship faced by Korean publications under Japanese colonial rule, particularly concerning sensitive topics like relations with Japanese people, potential Korean responses to their situation, and critical accounts of Japan, especially in the immediate aftermath of the Great Kantō Earthquake (implied by "Quake-stricken Tokyo" and "Quake Chaos"). Historians would find this interesting as direct evidence of censorship practices, the specific topics deemed dangerous by the colonial government in late 1923, and the publishers' constrained response.
