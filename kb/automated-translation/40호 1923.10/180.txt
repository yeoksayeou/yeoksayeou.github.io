A Great Strange Affair in the Yŏngyang Education World (Parents Rise Up Over the Issue of Co-locating the Elementary School vs. the Public Ordinary School)
						Yi Ŭl

Although Yŏngyang (英陽) in North Kyŏngsang Province (慶北) is a small town nestled in remote valleys, the world has already highly praised the fact that its facilities for the education of Korean children, regardless of whether public or private, are truly above all else. Alas, good things attract troubles (好事多魔). Unexpectedly, the administrator of the Yŏngyang Public Ordinary School, County Magistrate Han Hŭi-sŏk (韓禧錫), the head of the county's general affairs section, Mîke Zenzaburō (三池全三郞), the principal of the same school, Yamaguchi Shinji (山口伸二), and the principal of the Yŏngyang Public Elementary School (尋常小學校), Noda Daïnojō (野田大之常), under the fine-sounding name of promoting so-called "Japanese-Korean Harmony" (日鮮融和), secretly conspired to co-locate the Elementary School with the Ordinary School and transfer a portion of the Ordinary School's basic assets. Furthermore, adding one proxy council member to two regular Ordinary School council members (評議員), they drafted an agreement comprising ten articles in total. Among its articles, the main points were: One, "Items requiring setup, including furnishings or those belonging to real estate, shall be established using the Ordinary School's funds." Two, "Among the facilities in the preceding clause, those to be used by the Elementary School shall be jointly financed by the school association according to the provisions of the respective year's budget (however, shared ownership stakes shall not be divided hereby)." However, regarding this, the parents' side, seeking to understand whether the true intention of the co-location lay with the county authorities, questioned the officials. The officials responded, "Educationally, the standards and all other contents of Japanese ('mainland') children and Korean children are markedly different, so something like studying together in the same classroom (同席共學) is absolutely unacceptable. The true intention behind the content of this current co-location issue lies in having the Ordinary School bear the full cost of the Elementary School's new construction and other equipment." Startled (喫驚) by this answer, the parents' side immediately rose up in indignation (憤起) and repeatedly negotiated with the county authorities, explaining exhaustively its unfairness, but ultimately faced stubborn refusal. Consequently, having no other choice, on August 31st, they held another public parents' meeting and drafted a resolution stating, "The co-location of Yŏngyang Public Ordinary School and Yŏngyang Public Elementary School is disadvantageous to Yŏngyang Public Ordinary School; therefore, we resolve to oppose this with unified cooperation and pursue our objective to the very end." They further decided to petition the Provincial authorities and the Government-General (總督府), and if they still could not obtain a satisfactory response, they resolved to carry out even a final allied school strike (同盟休學) simultaneously. From this point, the county authorities' attitude became even more rigid. To suppress the parents' meeting, they even requested police intervention, and there was no shortage of improper actions, such as threatening to revoke the business licenses of those attending the parents' meeting<106>. On the one hand, they prohibited gatherings within the school and gave unreasonable warnings to the schoolchildren. Furthermore, the Provincial authorities stated, "Not only has there been no application or report whatsoever, but even if there were, the so-called co-location issue is something to be considered carefully." Despite this, it is said that they publicly spread false propaganda to the residents of each township (面民), stirring up public sentiment.

Thinking privately (窃惟), is this the playful mischief (戱謔) of infants, erupting unconsciously and suddenly? Or should it be called a trial run of demonic means to forcefully seize another's property? Now, refuting their high-handed attitude: (1) Their zealous pursuit of co-location is not only absent from the establishment of new and old Education Ordinances but also completely unprecedented in past practice. What kind of hobgoblin's (獨脚鬼) game is this, which cannot even achieve the co-education system (共學制) that they claim "actual circumstances do not permit"? (2) Under the banner of "equal benevolence to all" (一視同仁) and advocating so-called "Japanese-Korean Harmony," they dare to take coercive actions, unacceptable to heaven and man, frequently treating one side as a swaddled infant (襁褓物) ignorant of east or west. (3) Ignoring the fact that the funding sources for the education expenses of both sides are entirely separate in nature, they adopt unreasonable conflation tactics, an inconsiderate act that violates the administrative spirit of the Government-General. (4) To prevent opposition from more than half of the council members (評議員)—an advisory body meant to respect public opinion in the compilation of the so-called school expense budget and other matters large and small—they manipulated cunning means, did not follow proper procedures, merely added the consent of a single proxy (代理), and acted presumptuously, disregarding laws and regulations. (5) Despite accumulating a not insignificant basic fund from designated donations (指定寄附金) and savings interest (貯金利子), and being under the management of over twenty association members with strong political and economic backing, and having no difficulty, rather possessing ample economic leeway, with only six or seven male and female students, they seem to covet (流涎) the real estate worth over four thousand Won purchased during the time of the Yŏnghŭng School (英興學校), the predecessor of the Ordinary School. Isn't their intention to increase the misery of one side, which is already struggling (岌岌) to meet the urgent need to accommodate currently less than four hundred children who are afflicted by enrollment difficulties, while the capacity is entirely insufficient? (6) If it is, in fact, a stopgap measure (彌縫策) for their own survival difficulties, wouldn't it be proper justice (堂堂正義) to, putting themselves in the other's shoes (易地思之), sincerely and wholeheartedly lay bare their hearts (胸襟) and earnestly beg (懇乞) for the great sympathy of human love? With what kind of heart and mind (抑何心腸) do they fabricate such childish, dull, bizarre, and unpredictable barbaric misdeeds (蠻的 非行)? That County Magistrate Han (韓郡守), one of the Korean officials who merely holds sinecure positions (尸位素餐), following the pleasing airs (頣風) and autumn glances (秋波) of others, has unfortunately been drawn into this vortex of injustice (不義渦), compels us not only to rebuke his incompetence and mediocrity (無能 庸劣) but also to be unable to forgive (恕諒) his lack of conscience (良心). Envying others' wealth, thinking less of others' deaths than their own swollen feet (足瘇), shifting their own misfortunes onto others—this wicked faction (惡德派), becoming Yang Zhu (楊朱) while forcefully urging Mohist teachings (墨子學) upon others, in a place where mountains are high, valleys deep, and people absent (山高谷深無人處). These types who act like daytime ghosts (晝出魍魎), foxes borrowing the tiger's might (狐假虎威)—will the fire they ignite, like a prairie fire (燎原之火), not only bring misfortune upon the corner of Yŏngyang but also spread to the entire Korean education world in the future? How can this be dismissed as mere baseless anxiety (杞憂)? Alas, a storm on flat ground (平地風波)! Reflect! How about eradicating the roots of baseness (陋劣), contemptuousness (輕蔑), impatience (燥急), deceptiveness (妖妄), and hatefulness (可憎), and instead swiftly grasping the demeanor of a magnanimous elder (長者)—harmonious (雍和), respectful (鄭重), and generous (寬大)?<107>

**Summary**

This 1923 article from *Kaebyŏk* magazine reports on a conflict in Yŏngyang county, North Kyŏngsang Province, where Japanese colonial authorities and school officials proposed merging a Japanese elementary school (Simsang Sodŭnghakkyo) with the existing Korean public ordinary school (Pot'onghakkyo). Korean parents vehemently opposed this plan, viewing it as a scheme to force the Korean school to fund the Japanese school's facilities under the guise of "Japanese-Korean harmony," while officials explicitly rejected co-education. The parents organized protests, petitioned higher authorities, and threatened a school strike, facing intimidation and suppression from local officials, including the Korean county magistrate. The author strongly condemns the authorities' actions as unjust, deceitful, and detrimental to Korean education. For historians, this article offers a valuable glimpse into local Korean resistance against colonial education policies, the dynamics between Japanese officials and collaborating Korean elites (like the County Magistrate Han Hŭi-sŏk), the financial burdens imposed on Koreans for segregated facilities, and the rhetoric (like "日鮮融和" - Ilsŏn Yunghwa) used to justify discriminatory practices during the Japanese colonial period. The detailed account of the parents' organized opposition and the authorities' repressive measures highlights the tensions and conflicts surrounding education at the local level.
