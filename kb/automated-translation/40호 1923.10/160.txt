The 12th General Assembly of the Presbyterian Denomination of Christianity was held starting September 8th within the Sinŭiju First Church. Under the chairmanship of Mr. Kim Sŏngt'aek (金聖澤), new officers were first selected: Chairman Ham T'aeyŏng (咸台永), Vice-Chairman An Sŭngwŏn (安承源), Secretary Kim Usŏk (金禹錫), Assistant Secretary Hong Chongp'il (洪鍾弼), Recording Secretary Paek Sinch'il (白信七), Assistant Recording Secretary Chang Hongbŏm (張弘範), Treasurer Im T'aekkwŏn (林澤權), and Vice-Treasurer Hwangbo Tŏk (皇甫德). The members consisted of representatives from nineteen presbyteries: thirty missionaries (Westerners), seventy-six pastors, and seventy-two elders, totaling one hundred seventy-eight people. The resolutions were as follows:

1.  Pastor Kim Changho (金庄鎬) of the Hwanghae Presbytery (黃海老會) territory, taking advantage of the fact that the church building he ministered was registered in his name, went off as an autonomous faction and occupied the church building. However, as legal action was unsuccessful, and fearing similar incidents might occur elsewhere in the future, it was decided to negotiate with the Government-General (總督府), selecting Messrs. Ma P'o Samyŏl (馬布三悅) and Kim Sŏndu (金善斗) for this purpose.

2.  Within the Hwanghae Presbytery territory in Sariwŏn (沙里院) and the Kando Presbytery (間島老會) territory, the Methodist Denomination (監理派) has encroached, recruiting church members without transfer records by offering them positions if they join the Methodist church, accepting members under disciplinary action without due process, etc., leading to many disputes between the Presbyterian and Methodist factions (長監兩派). It was decided to negotiate this when the Presbyterian-Methodist Joint Council (長監連合協議會) convenes outside Sinmun (新門 外 - likely West Gate area) in Kyŏngsŏng (京城) on the 26th of this month.

3.  Although there is a phrase in the Presbyterian Church Constitution stating, "Miracles have ceased," Pastor Kim Ikto (金益斗) is currently performing actual miracles. Therefore, there was a motion from a delegate of the Hwanghae Presbytery that the relevant phrase must be deleted, arguing that if it remains, they would withdraw from its scope. It was decided to delete the phrase.

4.  It was reported that the Yi Manjip (李萬集) faction of the Taegu Church (大邱敎會) has established the "Joseon Jesus Church" (朝鮮 耶蘇敎會), causing much conflict, rejecting missionaries, and consequently withdrawing from the Kyŏngbuk Presbytery (慶北老會) and the Presbyterian General Assembly. <104>

5.  Four missionaries had been dispatched to Shandong Province (山東省), China (支那), and mission work was being carried out with a budget of 26,000 won until now. However, due to difficulties in collecting funds as budgeted, this year the budget was set at only 20,000 won for dispatch. Additionally, it was decided to dispatch two missionaries to Siberia (西伯利亞) with a budget of 2,000 won.

6.  It was decided to negotiate with the authorities so that pastors, like employees of official, public, and private schools, can receive discount coupons [for travel].

7.  It was decided to send condolences regarding the floods in the West (西洋水災) and the Tokyo earthquake (東京震災).

8.  The Sinŭiju Second Church has not yet received approval from the higher assembly (上會). However, it is by no means breaking away with different doctrines; the split occurred due to emotional discord (감정) resulting from incompatibility with the pastor and several elders of the First Church. Within that church building, during the current General Assembly, Pastor Cho Sihan (趙時漢) preached and Mr. Cha Sangjin (車尙晋) prayed. This became an issue raised even at the General Assembly as improper.

9.  It was decided that the next year's General Assembly will convene in Hamhŭng (咸興). <105>
<104-105>

**Summary**

This article reports on the resolutions passed at the 12th General Assembly of the Korean Presbyterian Church held in Sinŭiju in September 1923. Key decisions included addressing a church property seizure by negotiating with the Japanese Government-General, confronting Methodist encroachment on Presbyterian congregations, removing a constitutional clause denying modern miracles in light of Pastor Kim Ikto's activities, acknowledging the schism led by Yi Manjip in Taegu, reducing funding for overseas missions in China and Siberia, seeking travel discounts for pastors, sending condolences for disasters abroad (Western floods, Tokyo earthquake), managing an internal church split in Sinŭiju due to personal conflicts, and setting Hamhŭng as the location for the next assembly. From a historical perspective, the article reveals significant internal strains within the early Korean Protestant church during the colonial period, including property disputes, interdenominational rivalry, theological debates reflecting revivalist trends (Kim Ikto's miracles), anti-missionary sentiments leading to schisms (Yi Manjip), the church's pragmatic engagement with colonial authorities, and its connection to global events. The financial difficulties affecting mission budgets are also noteworthy.

3. 長老敎 憲法 제 몃條에 「異蹟은 停止되엿다」는 문구가 잇지만 현재 金益斗목사는 실로 異蹟을 행한 즉 該文句를 삭제하여야지 만일 그냥두면 그 범위내에서 脫出하겟다는 黃海老會總代員의 動議가 잇서 該文句를 삭제하기로 하다.
