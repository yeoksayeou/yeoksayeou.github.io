Especially to Our Northern Korean Brothers

The "Basic Survey of Korean Culture," which our company began early on, has since proceeded steadily, completing the surveys for North and South Kyŏngsang Province, North P'yŏngan Province, and Kangwŏn Province. This time, we are heading towards North Hamgyŏng Province.

The person who will actually conduct the survey is Mr. Pak Tal-sŏng, Head of the Social Affairs Department in our company's Editorial Bureau. The standards for the survey cover the overall aspects of that region's politics, economy, thought, historic sites, legends, and notable figures. Therefore, to all our brothers residing in North Hamgyŏng Province, please assist as much as your strength allows. We are for you, and you are for us; where we mutually exert our utmost efforts, happiness that both you and we can rejoice in together shall surely reign.

**Summary**

This is an announcement from the Kaebyŏk Company regarding their ongoing "Basic Survey of Korean Culture." Having already surveyed several southern and western provinces, they are now dispatching Mr. Pak Tal-sŏng to North Hamgyeong Province to investigate its politics, economy, thought, historical sites, legends, and people. The article is an appeal to the residents of North Hamgyeong Province for their cooperation, framing the survey as a mutual effort for the benefit and happiness of all Koreans. From a historical perspective, this article is interesting as it showcases a significant effort by a Korean organization during the colonial period to systematically document Korean culture and society across various regions and disciplines. This highlights a contemporary Korean intellectual interest in defining and preserving national identity and knowledge despite the political situation. The broad scope of the survey and the appeal to shared brotherhood underscore a sense of national consciousness and purpose.
