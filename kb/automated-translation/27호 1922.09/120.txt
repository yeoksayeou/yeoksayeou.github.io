東光高等普通學校를 一瞥하고
						如天生

It was 3 PM on August 16th. At this time, the temperature in the city had reached 96.7 degrees [Fahrenheit]. However, at the entrance to Sungil-dong, a cool breeze blew in from the valley. As this was my first visit here, I asked a farmer, "Where is the Tonggwang School?" The farmer kindly pointed, saying, "It's that large tile-roofed house over there in the pine forest." Treading on the tree shadows, I slowly walked towards the large tile-roofed house in the pine forest. It was a grand, old-style building, formerly the Bukmyo (北廟 - North Shrine), which many people used to worship. Before even visiting the school authorities, I sat down first in a cool spot in the pine forest on the hill behind the house to wipe away my sweat and looked around in all four directions. Truly, the air is good, and the atmosphere is also very fine. A clear stream girdles it like a belt (淸溪襟帶), layered rocks form a screen-like shape (層巖屛狀), and below the rocks, a precious jade spring (一寶玉泉) gushes out coolly (冷然瀉出). About ten steps above it, a large rock stands imposingly (大石磅礴), where a trickling jade stream (玉流) gathers to form a jade pond (玉潭). Overflowing, it runs down the lower stone wall (石壁) creating a waterfall (瀑布). The grotto area (洞府) is spacious (寬敞), and the level ground (墳衍) is somewhat broad (稍廣). With a thousand acres of fertile land (良田千畝) where paths crisscross (阡陌縱橫), grass and trees flourish (草木茂盛), residents are few (居民鮮少), and the scenery is superb (風景絶勝). It is truly a place of sweet springs and fertile soil, suitable for farming and washing (泉甘土沃 可稼可濯), a grotto-heaven and blessed land (洞天福地), indeed a separate, secluded realm (別界隩區). Moreover, I felt it was particularly appropriate as a school location (學校位置). After wiping off all my sweat and taking in the scenery, I sought out the school authorities and came to hear about the history of the school and the school building. As it happened, the principal (敎長), Mr. Paek Nam-kyu (白南奎), was not in, but the vice-principal (校監), Mr. Cho Hak-yu (曹學乳), kindly told me the story. I listened to his account, viewed the actual site (實地), and based on what I heard and saw, I write the following.

In former times, Master Uam Song (尤庵 宋先生), Song Si-yŏl (時烈), who strove for good governance by inviting the wise and accepting scholars (勵精圖治 聘賢納士), while responding (膺하야) to a summons by banner (旌招) from his country home in Hoedŏk (懷德鄕第) and awaiting orders in the capital (輦下), sought to avoid the clamor and dust (囂塵) of the city. He chose this place for lingering (盤旋) and newly built (新築) a refined three-kan dwelling (三間精舍). Enjoying the scenery (遊賞) and marking its uniqueness (異標), he personally wrote and deeply carved (手書深刻) four large characters, "Zēng Zhū Bì Lì" (曾朱壁立 - Zengzi and Zhu Xi standing like cliffs), on the rock face (巖面), and two large characters, "Yogch'ŏn" (浴川 - Bathing Stream), beside the pond (潭傍). His calligraphy (心畫) was strong and vigorous (遒健), almost competing in majesty (雄) with the force of the mountains (岳勢). At that time, he cultivated himself and rested here (藏修遊息), happily forgetting to return (欣然忘返), finding a joy almost not exchangeable even for the position of the Three Ducal Ministers (三公不換之樂). However, in the Gisa year (己巳 - 1689), the Master received the later command [of execution] at Ch'osan (楚山), and his footsteps (杖屨) never returned to this place (此地). For several desolate hundred years (寥寥數百年), the mountain colors seemed to hold the sorrow of parting (離恨), and the sound of the spring seemed to cry in sorrow (嗚咽). Several old rooms (老屋數間) stood tall alone (巍然獨存). The village name (洞名) was still named after the Master's esteemed surname (華姓 - Song), serving only to provide material for the legends (傳說) of the residents and remaining elders (居人遺老).

Later, in the 19th year of Emperor Kojong's (高宗皇帝) reign, the Im'o year (壬午 - 1882), the Emperor was moved by a strange dream (異夢) and ordered the rebuilding (復建) of the Guan Yu Shrine (關王廟). Construction began (經始) at this location (此地), and its completion (落成) was announced the following year, Kyemi (癸未 - 1883). This was called the Bukmyo (北廟 - North Shrine) and was devoutly enshrined without neglect (虔奉不廢) for over 300 years.

In the winter of the Kapsin year (甲申 - 1884), an unprecedented (破天荒) event in four thousand years suddenly arose (突起) at the hands of several young renowned figures (幾個少年名士), bringing the curtain down (終幕) inside this building (此舍內) on a great tragedy (一大悲劇) of eternal sorrow and regret (萬古哀恨) for us. This was the political reform movement (政治革新運動) by top-class figures (一流名士) such as Kim Ok-kyun (金玉均), Sŏ Kwang-bŏm (徐光範), Sŏ Chae-p’il (徐載弼), Hong Yŏng-sik (洪英植), Pak Yŏng-kyo (朴泳敎), Pak Yŏng-hyo (朴泳孝), Pyŏn Su (邊燧), <84> Sin Pok-mo (申福模), and others. This was a time when powerful ministers from the Queen's clan (外戚權臣) held national authority (國權) hereditarily, and the people's misery (塗炭) grew worse daily (日甚). Having lived austerely (薪膽生活) while observing overseas trends (海外風習), longing (流涎) for the excellent institutions (良典) of Western European constitutionalism (西歐立憲), and wringing their hands (扼腕) over the harmful effects (流弊) of East Asian despotism (東亞專制), they ground their fists (拳磨) and rubbed their palms (掌擦) with immense sharp spirit (萬丈銳氣). Under the fervent sincerity (熱誠) of wanting to annihilate (全滅) the stubborn and corrupt old government faction (頑敗 舊政府派) with one move (一擧手) and free their brothers (兄弟) living in unfreedom (不自由), they used the Post Office (郵政局) completion banquet (落成宴) on the night of October 17th as an opportunity (機). At the very beginning (劈頭), they attempted to assassinate (狙擊) the conservative leader (守舊首領) Min Yŏng-ik (閔泳翊), but mistakenly hit (誤中) and severed (截) his right ear (右耳). Consequently, on the late dawn of the 18th, they killed (殺) key figures among the maternal relatives' ministers (戚臣中堅) Min T’ae-ho (閔台鎬), Cho Yŏng-ha (趙寧夏), Min Yŏng-mok (閔泳穆), Han Kyu-jik (韓圭稷), Yun T’ae-chun (尹泰俊), Yi Cho-yŏn (李祖淵), and others, and organized (組織) a new government (新政府). At that time (當時), the conservative faction (守舊派) sought support (後援) from Qing China (淸國), while the new government faction (新政派) had assistance (援助) from Japan (日本). There were battle engagements (接戰) between Japanese and Qing soldiers (日淸兩兵), resulting in numerous casualties (多數 死傷). The entire city was in an uproar (滿城洶洶), and people high and low (上下) were terrified (恐惶), not knowing what to do (所措罔知). At that time (時), the King (大駕) and Queen (中宮) moved (播遷) to this shrine (此廟). While Hong Yŏng-sik (洪英植) and others, escorting (扈從) them, were strongly requesting (力請) their return to the palace (還宮), the Qing general (淸將) Yüan Shih-k’ai (袁世凱) led troops to attack (率兵來擊). Hong Yŏng-sik, Pak Yŏng-kyo (朴泳敎), and seven officer cadets (士官生徒) shed blood and died for the cause (流血殉身) in this shrine's courtyard (此廟庭), becoming martyrs mourned by the nation (國殤) – an eternal regret (千秋遺恨). The remaining faction members (餘黨) fled (走*) overseas (海外) and were never able to achieve their wish (願) of staging a comeback (捲土重來). After the Emperor returned to the palace (皇帝還宮), citing the help and protection (助佑) of King Guan (關王) in killing the nation's traitors (國家兇漢) in front of the shrine (廟前), veneration (崇奉) became even more diligent (益勤). A stele was erected praising his virtues (立碑頌德), and the shrine corridors were expanded and built (增築廟廊), making its magnificent and grand appearance (輪奐宏偉) the finest (冠) among all Guan Yu shrines (諸關王廟).

After the Gabo Political Change (甲午政變 - 1894), the veneration (崇奉) of this shrine became limited (止) to the votive rites (賽祀) of common women in the alleys (委巷婦女). After Kyŏngsul (庚戌 - 1910), the image (形狀) of Guan Yu was enshrined together (合奉) at the Dongmyo (東廟 - East Shrine), and this shrine became an empty house (閑家屋). The desolate hall (荒殿) was silent (寂寂), its courtyard full of autumn grass (滿庭秋草).

Buddhism (佛敎), which had been a useful tool (利器) for all sorts of civilization (萬般文明) since Koryŏ (高麗以來), had been in a dormant state (不飛不鳴 狀態) for the past several hundred years (最近幾百年間). However, accompanying the trend of the times (世運推移) and awakening (覺) to the duty (義務) of contributing to society (社會奉貢), it took its first dramatic step (衝天驚人 第一步). In August of Taishō 4 (1915), the Thirty Head Temples (三十本山) established (設立) the Buddhist Central Academy (佛敎中央學林), borrowing this shrine (此廟) for use as a school building (校舍). In April of Taishō 10 (1921), they applied (出願) for the establishment (設立) of Tonggwang Higher Common School (東光高等普通學校). Approval (認可) was recently granted, and they needed and used this land and building (此地此舍), leading to the present day (今日), or so I was told.

Thus, for those teaching (學授) and receiving instruction (敎受) at Tonggwang School, in a school building (校舍) with such a complex history (波瀾重疊 沿革), there must be an extraordinary significance (남다른 意義).

It is said that this school, along with the recent change in the school system (校制變更), is recruiting (募集) approximately (約) one hundred (百名) students for the first year (1學年) and several tens (若千名) for the second year (2學年).

As I turned back out of the entrance to Sungil-dong (崇一洞 於口), the sun considerably set (자못 기울럿는데), carrying this fleeting impression (幻念) I captured briefly (暫間) from my glimpse (一瞥) of the school, only the strange gleam (이상히 번씩일 뿐이더이다) of the grass-mowing scene (풀비는 장기) of that farmer (農軍)—who earlier, when I passed through, had said, "That large tile-roofed house over there is the school"—remained. <85>

**Summary**

This article describes the author's visit to Tonggwang Higher Common School, located in a former royal shrine (Bukmyo) in Sungil-dong. The author details the beautiful natural surroundings and the building's layered history: initially a retreat for the scholar Song Si-yŏl, then rebuilt as the Bukmyo shrine by Emperor Kojong, dramatically becoming the final scene of the failed Gapsin Coup (1884) where key reformers were killed, later venerated then falling into disuse after 1910, and finally repurposed in 1915 as a Buddhist academy before becoming the Tonggwang Higher Common School in 1921. The author reflects on the profound historical significance of studying in such a location. For historians, the article offers a contemporary (1922) perspective on the Gapsin Coup's connection to a specific site, the perceived decline of traditional institutions like royal shrines under Japanese rule, and the re-emergence of Buddhism into the educational sphere as a modernizing force. The detailed recounting of the Gapsin Coup events at the Bukmyo, including the names of participants and victims, is particularly valuable.

						如天生
8月 16日 下午 3時이엇섯습니다. 이때에 市內는 溫度 96度 7分이 되엇슬 때입니다. 그러나 崇一洞 於口에는 서늘한 바람이 골 속으로 불어왓습니다. 나는 이곳이 初行인 故로 農夫더러 무럿습니다. 『여긔 東光學校가 어대 잇습니까?』고, 農夫는 손을 들어 저긔 저 松林 속에 잇는 큰 기와집입니다고 親切하게 일러 줍니다. 나는 나무 그림자를 발부며 천천한 거름으로 松林속 큰 개와집을 차저 갓습니다. 굉장한 舊式建物인데 以前에 萬人이 崇拜하든 北廟이엇섯습니다. 나는 學校當局者를 訪問하기도 前에 爲先 땀을 좀 들이랴고 그집 뒤 언덕 松林 속 서늘한데 안저서 4面을 살펴 보앗습니다. 참으로 空氣도 조커니와 운치도 매우 조흡니다. 淸溪는 襟帶요 層巖은 屛狀이며 巖下에는 一寶玉泉이 冷然瀉出하고 其上十步許에 大石이 磅礴한데 涓*한 玉流가 匯하얀 玉潭을 成하고 充溢하야 나즌쪽 石壁으로 흘러 瀑布를  作하얏스며 洞府가 寬敞하고 墳衍이 稍廣하야 良田千畝에 阡陌이 縱橫한데 草木이 茂盛하고 居民이 鮮少하며 風景이 絶勝하니 참으로 泉甘土沃의 可稼可濯이오 洞天福地에 진즉 別界隩區이라 더욱이 學校位置로는 適切하다는 感이 잇습니다. 땀을 다들이고 또 求景도 다하고 學校當局者를 차저서 學校와 밋 校舍의 沿革을 듯게 되엇습니다. 마츰 敎長 白南奎씨는 안게시고 校監 曹學乳氏가 친절하게 말슴하야 들려주엇습니다. 나는 이약이도 듯고 實地로 現場을 觀覽하고 그모든것을 듯고 븐대로 알에다 씁니다. 넷적 勵精圖治에 聘賢納士하시든 尤庵 宋先生(時烈)이 懷德鄕第로부터 旌招를 膺하야 輦下에 命을 待할 새 城市의 囂塵을 避하야 盤旋의 地를 此에 相하야 三間의 精舍를 新築하고 勝을 遊�하여 異를 標하야 巖面에는 曾朱壁立四大字와 潭傍에는 浴川二大字를 手書深刻하니 心畫이 遒健하야 거의 岳勢로 더불어 雄을 爭하는지라 그當時에는 藏修遊息에 欣然忘返하야 殆히 三公不換의 樂을 寓하엿더니 己巳에 先生이 楚山의 後命을 受하야 杖屨가 此地에 復到치 못하니 寥寥 數百年에 山色이 離恨을 含하고 泉聲이 嗚咽을 鳴하는데 老屋數間이 巍然獨存하니 洞名이 오히려 先生의 華姓을 胃하야 居人遺老의 전설을 資할 而已엿다. 그後 高宗皇帝 卽位 19年 壬午에 皇帝異夢을 感하시고 關王廟를 復建할새 此地에 經始하야 이듬해 癸未에 落成을 告하니 此를 北廟라 稱하고 三百餘年來에 虔奉不廢하엿습니다. 甲申 冬에 四千年來의 破天荒의 一擧가 幾個少年名士의 手下에서 突起하야 우리로써 萬古哀恨의 一大悲劇을 此舍內에서 終幕하니 이는 即 金玉均, 徐光範, 徐載弼, 洪英植, 朴泳敎, 朴泳孝, 邊燧,＜84＞ 申福模 鼟 一流名士의 政治革新運動이니 이때는 外戚權臣이 國權을 世執하야 국민의 塗炭이 日甚할 때다. 海外風習에 薪膽生活로 西歐立憲의 良典에 流涎하고 東亞專制의 流弊를 扼腕하든 萬丈銳氣로 拳을 磨하고 掌을 擦하야 頑敗한 舊政府派를 一擧手로 全滅하고 不自由 中에 잇는 兄弟를 自由롭게 하리라는 熱誠 下에서 10月 17日 夜 郵政局 落成宴을 機하야 劈頭에 守舊首領 閔泳翊을 狙擊타가 誤中하야 右耳를 截하고 因하야 18日 晩曉戚臣中堅인 閔台鎬, 趙寧夏, 閔泳穆, 韓圭稷, 尹泰俊, 李祖淵 等을 殺하고 新政府를 組織할 새 當時 守舊派는 淸國에 後援을 求하얏고 新政派는 日本의 援助가 잇섯는지라 日淸兩兵의 接戰도 有하야 多數의 死傷도 有하얏스며 滿城洶洶에 上下가 恐惶하야 所措를 罔知라. 時에 大駕와 中宮이 此廟로 播遷하시니 洪英植等이 扈從하야 還宮하심을 力請할새 淸將 袁世凱가 率兵來擊하야 洪英植과 朴泳敎 及 士官生徒 7人이 此 廟庭에서 流血殉身하야 千秋遺恨의 國殤이 되고 餘黨은 海外에 走*하야 永永 捲土重來의 願를 得遂치 못하얏습니다. 皇帝 還宮하신 後에 關王의 助佑로 因하야 國家兇漢을 廟前에서 殺하엿다 하야 더욱 崇奉이 益勤하야 立碑頌德하며 增築廟廊하니 輪奐宏偉의 觀이 都是諸關王廟의 冠이 되엇습니다.
甲午政變 以後로 此廟崇奉이 委巷婦女의 賽祀에 止하고 庚戌 以後에 關王의 形狀을 東廟로 合奉하니 此廟가 閑家屋이 되어 滿庭秋草에 荒殿이 寂寂하엿습니다. 高麗以來 萬般文明의 利器이든 佛敎는 最近 幾百年間에는 不飛不鳴의 狀態에 在하더니 世運의 推移를 伴하고 社會奉貢의 義務를 覺하야 衝天驚人의 第一步로 大正 4年(1915年) 8月에 三十本山이 佛敎中央學林을 設立할 새 此廟를 校舍로 貸用하고 大正 10年(1921年) 4月에 東光高等普通學校設立을 出願하얏더니 這間設立의 認可가 되어 此地此舍를 需用하야 今日에 至한다합니다.
이와가티 波瀾이 重疊한 沿革을 가진 校舍에서 學을 授하고 敎를 受하는 東光學校의 그네들에게는 남다른 意義가 업지 못할 것입니다.
이 學校에서는 今回校制의 變更됨과 共히 1學年에 約 百名, 2學年에 若千名의 生徒를 募集한다합니다. 내가 이 學校를 一瞥한 幻念으로 暫間 그 影을 撮하야 崇一洞 於口를 돌아나오는 때는 해가 자못 기울럿는데 先者이 於口를 通할 때에 「저긔저긔 큰 기와집이 그 학교입니다」하든 그 農軍의 풀비는 장기뿐이 이상히 번씩일 뿐이더이다.＜85＞
