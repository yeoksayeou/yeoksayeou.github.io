**Summary**

This article, titled "Esperanto Self-Study Room," appears to be a guide or lesson series for learning the Esperanto language, authored by the prominent Korean poet and translator Kim Ŏk (金億), who also used the Esperanto pen name "Verda E. Kim" (Green E. Kim - "Uerda" likely being a variation or older rendering of "Verda"). Published in the influential magazine *Kaebyŏk* in September 1922, it reflects the interest among some Korean intellectuals during the colonial period in Esperanto as an international language potentially fostering global communication outside the constraints of Japanese or other major power languages. The publication of such a guide in *Kaebyŏk*, a magazine often critical of colonial policies, is historically significant. It suggests an effort by Korean intellectuals like Kim Ŏk to engage with internationalist ideals and seek alternative global connections, potentially as a subtle form of cultural resistance or assertion of autonomy during Japanese rule. Historians might find this article indicative of the diverse strategies employed by Koreans to navigate the political and cultural landscape of the colonial era and their engagement with international movements like Esperanto.
