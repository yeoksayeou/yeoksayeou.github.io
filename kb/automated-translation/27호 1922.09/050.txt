Louse
(虱)

Vile creatures, squirming, satiated with warmth,
Deeply entrenched in undergarments, their power rooted.
Searched out, their eggs and shells leave numerous progeny,
Scratched, the skin shows mottled, festering marks.
They happily act as guests on the master's ragged clothes,
Their scattered kinfolk inhabit a village of tattered garments.
Divided neighbors, black and white, live unmixed,
Mourning together a life spent fearing the washbasin.

Bedbug
(蝎)

At finger's end, a foul stench marks its posthumous fame,
On mud walls, spotty patterns form like bamboo paintings.
Hundreds charge forth, clinging like ants,
A swarm feasts voraciously until the cock crows.
Cleverly occupying pillow cracks, hiding securely,
Searched for broadly by lamplight, they flee with light steps.
Ugly creatures, plaguing people, impossible to exterminate completely,
Besieged nightly, one sits within walls of sorrow.

Fly
(蠅)

Buzzing and flying, the filthy creatures swagger about,
Swarming chaotically over books, covering pillows and beds.
Busy wings and legs make a living on scraps,
Plunging to death in hot soup brings satisfaction to the gut.
Adept at leaving dirty spots, constantly rubbing stains,
Particularly annoying peaceful sleep, making one want to draw a sword.
Don't rely on your moment of ascendancy,
Just watch the thatched roofs when the clear frost descends.

Mosquito
(蚊)

Tiny ephemeral things, poisonous insects of equal measure,
Piercing heavy curtains, diligently seeking food.
Chaotically biting like red cherries, awaiting the setting sun,
Exposed tendons on green grass, mourning a lonely grave.
A multitude of voices rises at once like shaking mountains,
Small wings in dense swarms are enough to obscure the clouds.
Smudging fires are useless, waving fans becomes tiring,
By the dim lamp, in silence, they are heard circling the bed.<44>

**Summary**

This article presents four classical Chinese poems (Hansi) attributed to "Dam Ong," describing common household pests: lice, bedbugs, flies, and mosquitoes. Each poem vividly details the appearance, habits, and nuisance caused by the respective pest, employing rich imagery and classical allusions. The tone mixes disgust with close observation, portraying the relentless annoyance these creatures inflict upon humans, from itchy bites and spoiled food to sleepless nights. For historians, these poems offer insight into the everyday life and concerns of Koreans during the early colonial period, reflecting living conditions where such pests were prevalent. The choice of classical Chinese verse, even for mundane subjects, highlights the continuation of traditional literary forms among Korean intellectuals. The poems might also contain subtle allegorical layers, potentially reflecting feelings of being plagued or besieged in a broader societal sense, though this is speculative.

漢詩
						擔翁遺稿
虱
賤物蠢然自飽溫, 褌中深據勢盤根.
搜來卵殼繁遺種, 爬得肌斑爛着痕.
好作主人襤褸客, 散亡親族瀚衣村.
隣分黑白居無雜, 相吊平生畏浴盆

蝎
指端惡臭死遺名, 泥壁斑斑竹畵成.
十百長驅如蟻附, 一群飽囓限鷄鳴.
巧占枕隙藏身密, 大索灯光走脚輕.
醜類困人誅不勝, 被圍夜夜坐愁城.

蠅
呱飛穢類自揚揚, 亂集圖書遍枕床.
殘縷營生忙翅脚  熱羹投死快心膓.
善遺汚尿常磨玷, 偏惱閒眠欲拔鋩
得志一朝渠莫恃, 第看茅屋下淸霜.

蚊
細蜉毒蠆等身分, 穿人重幃索食勤.
亂囓紅櫻期落日 露筋靑草吊孤墳.
衆聲一倡如掀嶽, 小翅群屯足蔽雲.
燻火無功搖扇倦, 燈昏寂寂繞床聞.＜44＞
