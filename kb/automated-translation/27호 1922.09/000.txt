Regarding the Prize Competition for Traditional Folktales
Matters for the Attention of All Applicants

Since the announcement of the prize competition for our country's traditional folktales was published in this magazine's previous issue (September issue), submissions of folktales from readers in various regions have been arriving daily. Among them are many precious folktales we heard in our childhood ten or even twenty-odd years ago, and also many folktales that were buried in various regions, unheard of until now, which have been newly unearthed this time. From this, we are already predicting the success of this endeavor and are glad to approach this work with much hope and interest.

However, as there are many applicants, there are also many who have written contrary to the application rules, and moreover, many readers are asking anew about the rules. Therefore, we reiterate the points for attention as follows:

One, Writing Style. Many ask whether they should write in the New Novel style or the Old Novel style, but any writing style is fine. As long as the content is interesting, accurate, and clear, we will correct and rewrite the style appropriately.

One, Manuscript Paper. Because many use any kind of manuscript paper, it causes cumbersome issues with line count calculation, editing, and other matters. You must use the Kaebyŏksa specially manufactured manuscript paper.

One, Many also ask about character count or page count limits, but there are no limits on character or page count. However, writers should prioritize conciseness and take care not to write brief content lengthily.

One, Among those already submitted, there seem to be one or two translations of foreign folktales, but translations of foreign works are absolutely invalid.

One, Handwriting. There are many instances where handwriting is difficult to discern due to being written hastily. No matter how good the content, if it cannot be read, it is regrettable but likely to be rejected. Please write as clearly as possible.

One, On the envelope, write "Kaebyŏksa Editorial Department, Kyŏngsŏng" (京城 開闢社 編輯局), but you must specifically write "Prize Manuscript" (懸賞原稿) beside it.

One, The deadline is November 10th of this year, but when there are identical folktales, the one that arrived first will be chosen, so it is advantageous to write even one day faster.

One, The prize money is 30 Won for first place, 20 Won for second place, and 10 Won for third place (no limit on the number of winners), but prizes will also be given for suitable entries outside these ranks.

Kaebyŏksa Editorial Department, Regards

**Summary**

This article is an editorial note from Kaebyŏksa regarding its recently announced competition for traditional Korean folktales. It expresses enthusiasm about the numerous submissions received, including both well-known and newly discovered tales. The note reiterates the competition rules due to applicant inquiries and errors: any writing style is acceptable if the content is good, submissions must use Kaebyŏksa's official manuscript paper, conciseness is valued over length, only original Korean tales (not translations) are eligible, handwriting must be legible, envelopes must be marked correctly, the deadline is November 10th (with preference for earlier submissions of identical tales), and prize money details (₩30, ₩20, ₩10, plus honorable mentions) are confirmed. From a historical perspective, the competition itself is significant as an effort by a Korean cultural magazine (Kaebyŏk) to collect, preserve, and promote indigenous Korean folklore during the Japanese colonial period, a time when Korean culture faced suppression. Historians might find the emphasis on using specific company manuscript paper and the details about judging criteria (like legibility and originality against foreign tales) revealing about publishing practices and cultural nationalist sentiments of the era.
