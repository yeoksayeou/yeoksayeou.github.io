Cool Talk under the Green Shade

South Fox and North Monkey
Last year, a certain Marquis (某侯爵) of Pukch'on, in a manner imitating a "monkey," wanting to do what others do, wasted a great deal of money to purchase an artificial rain machine. After repeated experiments ended in failure, a certain newspaper mocked it as the "Monkey Marquis's (猴爵) Failure." Now, a certain Count (某伯爵) of Namsan-chō, taking advantage of the gathering of the Moral Reform Society (矯風會) to try and seize hegemony over the entertainment world (花柳界), has attracted much public criticism. A certain newspaper report referred to him as "that usual Old Fox Count (老狸伯爵)." Are the nobles of Chosŏn only animals?

Women's "Six Endurances"
This year's heat is truly rare for recent years, but it seems there are quite many women enduring the mineral spring treatment (藥水마지군) at various spring sites. Thus, a special term, "six endurances" (六마지) troop, has arisen to refer to women going to the mineral springs. Namely, first is enduring sweat (汗), second is enduring insults (辱), third is enduring the husband's love (愛夫), fourth is enduring sudden rain showers (소낙비), fifth is enduring thieves (盜賊) (as the house is empty), and sixth is enduring beatings from the head of the household (家長). Haha.

Thirty-Seven Clan Association Offices
In its heyday, the number of Land Survey Offices (土地測量事務所) and various medicinal liquor houses (藥酒家) ranked first or second in Kyŏngsŏng. Recently, what has drastically increased in Kyŏngsŏng are the Clan Association Offices (宗約所). Do they think all worldly affairs (世事) are peaceful if they just publish the genealogy (譜牒) of a clan (一氏族) and exaggerate and extol the deeds of ancestors who are but dry bones in the grave (塚中枯骨)? According to an investigation somewhere, there are thirty-seven Clan Association Offices of various families within Kyŏngsŏng.

Long Hair and Bobbed Hair
Recently, among young men who consider themselves newly emerged artists (新出藝術家), a trend of growing long hair (長髮) is流行ing, perhaps to advertise themselves for free. In contrast, among women traditionally bearing stage names (藝名), namely kisaeng (藝妓), there are occasional cases of bobbing their hair (斷髮). Is the art of the male world progressing while the art of the female world is regressing?

The Imprisoned and Dismissed Park
T'aptong Park, though small, the sole paradise (樂園) for Koreans, has had its rear gate tightly locked since the Manse Incident (萬歲事件) occurred. The trees and lawn (樹木莎草) are not maintained, suffering the same sad fate as the Manse offenders who were imprisoned and dismissed (禁錮罷職). However, Changch'ungdan or Hanyang Park are expanded year by year, taking on a new appearance. The authorities' handling of parks is also unfair (不公平).

The Reddening of the Women's Army<71>

Since Russia's (露國) radicalism (過激主義) was propagated to the world, those in political circles (政局), regardless of the country (何國), develop a great phobia (大恐怖病) at the mention of 'Reddening' (赤化), implementing special controls (特別取締) through speech or writing (文字). Recently, it seems radical thought (過激思想) has infected the women's world (女子界) in Kyŏngsŏng, as the inner ribbons (안옷고름) of their red blouses (赤衫) are gradually becoming redder. This is also a curious affair (可怪한 事). If the authorities knew, this too would be grounds for crackdown (取締거리).

Drumming Sounds at the Sickbed of a Noble's Child
At the home of a certain noble (某貴族家) at the end of Kyŏngun-dong within the prefecture (府內), it seems there was recently someone suffering from madness (狂症). The frequent visits of acquaintances (知舊) and the numerous comings and goings of shamanistic practitioners (術客) truly suggest that the legacy (遺風) of the old meritorious families (勳門家) still survives (尙存), one might say. It is natural for doctors (醫師) to attend the sickbed (病席), but paying members of shaman associations (崇神人組合員) or old women fortune-tellers (奠乃家老婆) fifty Won per night to continuously disturb the neighbors' peaceful sleep (安眠) for two or three days with sounds of "ŏlsigu chŏlsŏ" (얼시고 절사소리) is truly strange (可怪). Since there's a police guard (保護巡査) in the house, no one is likely to crack down (取締), and since it's the house of a noble lord (貴族大監), perhaps the lord's antics (大監놀이) are only natural. But recalling how they turned red-faced (紅顔) trying not to pay the expenses for the neighborhood self-defense anti-epidemic station (洞里自衛防疫所) during the cholera (虎疫) epidemic the year before last, it is truly hateful (可憎).

The Labor Chairman with Seven Votes
Regarding Suzuki Bunji (鈴木文治), the honorary chairman of the Japan General Federation of Labor (日本 勞働總同盟) who recently came to Chosŏn, everyone knows him as someone with great trust (大信望) in the Japanese labor world. However, according to a well-informed source (某消息通), Mr. Suzuki received merely 7 votes during the 4th Labor Representative Election (第4回 勞働代表選擧). Seeing him, upon coming to Chosŏn and touring various regions, completely forget the true nature (本色) of a laborer, receive the protection (庇護) of government offices (官廳), and dash east and west (東馳西奔) triumphantly (得意揚揚) in an automobile as if he had achieved great success (大成功) in the labor movement (勞動運動), it seems getting even 7 votes wasn't particularly unjust (抑鬱).

There's a Limit Even to Pulling the Wool Over One's Eyes
The matter concerning Nakano Yūkō (中野有光) and Koga Renzō (古賀廉造) regarding the Opium Incident (阿片事件), titled "The Grand Indictment of 240,000 Characters" in the previous issue's column (本欄), resulted in Nakano being sentenced to one year and four months of imprisonment (一年 四月의 役) by the Ryojun High Court (旅順高等法院) on August 8th. Additionally, regarding a related civil suit (附帶社訴), he was ordered to pay reparations (賠償) amounting to the huge sum (巨額) of 108,310 yen and 40 sen. (Koga was acquitted). However, Nakano's (former Dairen Civil Administrator 大連民政署長) comments (所感談) on this are enough to attract considerable public attention (世間의 注意). He said, "I illegally sold (不正히 賣却) opium under orders (命) from the Kantō Agency (關東廳). Through this, I paid six million yen (六百萬圓) to the Kantō Agency over a year and a half (一年半). And finally, the ruling on the amount in the civil suit (私訴額) is truly a demand representing the nation of Japan (日本國). The Japanese state (國家) claims to have suffered damages (損害) even after illegally selling opium. This is truly lamentable (可嘆)." On one hand, they order the illegal sale, and on the other hand, they punish it (罰). The saying "pulling the wool over one's eyes" (눈가리고 아웅) must have been created for the Japanese state.<72>

**Summary**

This article is a collection of short, critical observations on contemporary Korean society in 1922 Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul). It satirizes the elite (nobles compared to animals, extravagant spending), comments on changing social customs (women at mineral springs, hair styles, proliferation of clan offices), critiques the perceived unfairness of colonial administration (neglect of T'aptong Park, handling of the opium scandal), notes social anxieties (fear of 'Reddening'/communism reflected in fashion), and mocks a visiting Japanese labor leader. For historians, the article offers valuable glimpses into colonial-era social commentary, revealing tensions between tradition and modernity, critiques of both Korean elites and Japanese colonial authorities, early observations on the labor movement's perception, and specific incidents like the neglect of Korean public spaces and the Kantō Agency opium scandal.

						一記者
南狸와 北猴
昨年에 北村 某侯爵이 「원숭이」흉내내는 格으로 남이 한다니 나도 하겟다는 欲心이 나서 多大한 金錢을 虛費하고 人工降雨機를 購入하야 屢次 實驗하다가 失敗에 歸함으로 某報에서 猴爵의 失敗라 嘲笑하더니 今般南山町某伯爵은 矯風會의 會集됨을 奇貨로 하야 花柳界의 패覇權을 執하랴다가 世評이 甚多한 中 某日字 報에서는 「例의 老狸伯爵」이라 評히얏스니 朝鮮의 貴族은 動物뿐인지.

女子의 「六마지」
今年 더위는 참 近年稀有의 더위지마는 各藥水터에 女子의 藥水마지군도 퍽 만흔 貌樣이다. 그럼으로 藥水에 가는 女子를 指名하야 「六마지」군이라는 特別名辭까지 生하얏스니 即 一은 땀(汗)마지, 二는 辱마지, 三은 愛夫마지, 四는 소낙비마지 五는 盜賊마지(집이 비니깐) 六은 家長에게 매마지, 呵呵

三十七個所의 宗約所
한참 當年에 土地測量事務所와 別別藥酒家數가 京城內에서 一二指를 屈하더니 近來 京城內에 激增된 것은 宗約所라. 그들은 一氏族의 譜牒이나 刊行하고 塚中枯骨된 祖先의 行蹟만 誇張峻論하면 世事가 皆太平인지 某處調査에 依하면 京城內 諸家의 宗約所가 三十七個所.

長髮과斷髮
近來 新出藝術家라 自處하는 靑年 中에는 無料로 自家廣告를 하기 爲함인지 長髮하는 風이 流行하는데 此와 反對로 自來藝名을 帶한 女子 即 藝妓 中에는 斷髮하는 事가 或有하니 男子界藝術은 進步되고 女子界 藝術은 退步됨인가.

禁錮罷職에 處한 公園
狹少하나마 朝鮮人의 唯一한 樂園인  塔洞公園은 萬歲事件이 發生한 以後로 後門을 深鎖하야 樹木莎草 等도 整治를 아니하야 萬歲犯人의 禁錮罷職을 當한 人과 同一한 悲運을 遭하얏다. 然而 獎忠壇이나 漢陽公園은 年年擴張하야 面目이 一新하니 當局의 公園에 對한 處事도 不公平.

娘子軍의 赤化＜71＞

露國의 過激主義가 世界에 宣傳된 以後로 何國을 勿論하고 政局에 在한 이들은 赤化라 하면 大恐怖病이 生하야 言論으로나 文字로나 特別取締하는데 近日 京城內 女子界에는 過激思想이 感染되엇는지 赤衫안옷고름이 漸漸 붉어가니 亦一可怪한 事이라 當局에서 알기만하면 此도 取締거리.

貴族兒病席에 鼕鼕聲
府內慶雲洞막바지 某貴族家에는 요새에 狂症忠者가 잇섯든 貌樣인데 知舊의 訪問이 頻煩한 것과 術客의 出入이 甚多한 것은 果然 前日 勳門家의 遺風이 尙存하얏다 可謂하겟다. 病席에 醫師出入은 當然하나 崇神人組合員이나 奠乃家老婆들 一夜五十圓式주어 二三日을 連續的으로 얼시고 절사소리로 隣家의 安眠을 妨害하는 것은 참 可怪한 일이다. 家中에 保護巡査가 잇스니까 누가 取締할 리도 업고 貴族大監의 집이니까 大監놀이도 當然하다마는 再昨年虎疫이 流行할 時에 洞里自衛防疫所에는 費用을 잘 내지 아니 하랴고 紅顔을 외로 들으든 생각을 하면 참 可憎.

七票의 勞働會長
今番 朝鮮에 來한 日本 勞働總同盟名譽會長鈴木文治君은 何人이든지 日本 勞動界에  大信望이 有한줄로 知하나 某消息通에 依하면 鈴木君이 第4回 勞働代表選擧時에 僅히 7표를 得하얏다한다. 氏가 朝鮮에 來하야 각지를 巡回할 時에 노동자의 本色은 전연 忘却하고 官廳의 庇護를 得하야 勞動運動에 大成功이나 한 듯이 自動車로 得意揚揚하야 東馳西奔하는 것을 보면 7票를 得함도 抑鬱한 事가 別無할 듯.

눈가리고 아웅도 有分數
前號의 本欄에 「二十四萬字의 大論告」이라 題한 中野有光, 古賀廉造의 阿片事件에 관한 件은 8月 8日 旅順高等法院으로부터 中野에게는 一年 四月의 役을 宣告하고 別로 附帶社訴에 關한 件으로 十萬八千三百十圓四十錢의 巨額을 賠償케 하얏다.(古賀는 無罪)그런데 이에 對한 中野(前大連民政署長)의 所感談은 甚히 世間의 注意를 起하기에 足하다. 가르되 나는 關東廳의 命으로 아편을 不正히 賣却한 것이라 이代로 關東廳에 一年半의 間에 六百萬圓을 納하엿다.  그리고 最後로 私訴額의 判決은 實로 日本國을 代表한 要求이라 日本의 國家는 아편을 不正히 매각하고도 오히려 損害를 受하얏다 하니 참으로 可嘆한 일이라 하엿다. 한편으로는 부정매각을 命하고 또한편으로는 이를 罰한다는 셈이지「눈가리고아웅」이란 말은 日本의 國家를 爲하야 생긴말.＜72＞
