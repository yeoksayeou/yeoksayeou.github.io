Second: Painting of the Goguryeo Period

When citing the characteristics of our painting, I briefly discussed how Eastern painting emphasizes brush technique (bone method - 骨法) and makes the resulting spirit resonance (氣韻) the primary focus, the essence of painting. I also mentioned that its origin is largely based on the idea of the unity of calligraphy and painting (書畵一體). The era when shapes were depicted by painting with lacquer on bamboo slips can hardly be called a time when artworks were produced yet. It is reasonable to assume that complete painting in the East emerged after the invention of the brush and the production of paper and ink. Because the brush, structurally, has a thick head and a fine, pointed tip, and is flexible in nature, it allows for freedom in brush movement, emitting a kind of power-beauty within the lines that pen drawings or oil paintings cannot capture. Thus, its characteristics were gradually fostered, leading to discussions of brush method, similar to calligraphy, and the advocacy of the subjective theory of spirit resonance. Calligraphy and painting not only share the same materials, but pictographic characters, though perhaps memory-based copying, also originated from representing the shapes of things. Thus, some even claimed that calligraphy and painting are one. This stems from the failure to distinguish that while characters originated from pictograms, they inevitably remain purely symbolic, whereas painting always finds its footing in reality, and thus is not to be taken seriously. Furthermore, delving into the content, proponents emerged advocating the theory of unity between the two based on the theory of spirit resonance. Compared to the former who based their arguments externally, this represents a step forward. As Chinese characters <13> were created as ideographs, each character expresses a unique meaning. Therefore, their appreciation flourished early on, leading to calligraphy. Accompanied by the practical necessity of daily use, it achieved rapid progress, already reaching its golden age during the Jin (晉) Dynasty with the emergence of master calligraphers like Wang Xizhi (王羲之). As characters, originally subjective, varied in brush method depending on the calligrapher's personality and mood, the three styles of standard script (楷書), running script (行書), and cursive script (草書) were created. Among these, standard script is objective and solemn, while cursive script is subjective and unrestrained; running script occupies the middle ground. Each stroke aims to express the dynamism of the line, deeming those full of power-beauty superior and those lacking inferior, also stemming from the reverence for spirit resonance. Therefore, painters who wished to fully embrace subjectivism and advocate spirit resonance inevitably had to discuss the unity of calligraphy and painting, and consequently, the influence of calligraphy was significant. The "one-stroke painting" (一筆畵) initiated by Lu Tanwei (陸探微) originated from the graceful "one-stroke calligraphy" (一筆書) of Wang Xianzhi (王獻之). In later generations, landscape painting was even divided into the three categories of standard, running, and cursive (眞, 行, 草), showing many similarities even in form.

Generally, Eastern people excel in introspective philosophical thought. Their reverence for the mystical is evident in the fact that almost all major religions originated in the East and spread from there. Possessing a perspective quite different from the scientific thinking of Europeans who favor analysis and synthesis, they have instead loved and embraced nature, seeking ideals by merging with the universe, transcending this world, and pursuing the blissful state found in the vast,恍惚 (ecstatic trance). Therefore, they viewed being bound by formalism with abhorrence and vehemently rejected it. Even the so-called virtues of ethics, considered important, were relentlessly criticized by Laozi for their detrimental effects. Zhang Yanyuan (張彦遠) of the Tang dynasty, in his *Lidai Minghua Ji* (歷代名畵記 - Record of Famous Paintings in Successive Dynasties), discussed the flaws of contemporary painting, saying:
"Painters today, roughly skilled in depicting appearances, achieve resemblance in form but lack spirit resonance; they apply colors but lose the brush method. How can this be called painting?"
Viewed from this perspective, it is no wonder that resemblance in form and application of color (形似傳彩) in painting were recognized as means to achieve vibrant spirit resonance (氣韻生動). The aim was to transcend objective realism and prioritize the expression of subjective spirit resonance. Going against the indispensable nature of spirit resonance in calligraphy and painting, some went so far as to infer the writer's or painter's personality and temperament from the expressed <14> spirit resonance, calling calligraphy the "imprint of the mind" (心之鎭) or the "seal of the mind" (心之印). Regarding the artist's personality expressed in the artwork, it is not the place to discuss it here; it suffices to know that spirit resonance was considered the life of painting.
The above is an observation of spirit resonance, the characteristic of Eastern painting, through its connection with calligraphy and relationship with philosophical thought. We, who have summarized the characteristics of Eastern art as the characteristics of Korean art, find the theory of spirit resonance proven by the extant ink works of the Goguryeo people, the ancestors of our art nation, acclaimed by all as unparalleled treasures in the world. No, how could it merely amount to proving such things? Furthermore, transcending the bounds of spirit resonance, they produced divine works where the conflict between realism and idealism vanished.

Although Eastern painting, especially ancient painting, often utilized silk (縑素), which was convenient for free brush movement even after the discovery of paper-like materials, forming hanging scrolls, it goes without saying that hardly any survive today. Even murals from large architectural structures rarely retain their original form due to severe deterioration. Nevertheless, we must gather the remaining traces of these rare murals here to infer the general path of painting's transition and change. Generally, Goguryeo painting can be divided into two categories based on the distinctiveness of its surviving locations and the ideals of its techniques. One category exists within the Korean Peninsula (半島), forming murals in underground chambers, while the other exists in the island nation of Japan (扶桑), forming murals in the Golden Hall (金堂) of a great temple. One consists of northern, purely martial-style paintings exhibiting magnificent spirit resonance, while the other consists of Buddhist paintings, expressions of devout faith, emitting a compassionate spiritual aura. While both undoubtedly display the unique brilliance of Goguryeo, it is the murals within the ancient tombs on the peninsula that show more points in common with architectural characteristics and further express the distinct features of the Goguryeo temperament. It is somewhat regrettable that we cannot discuss them under the theme of "Painting" itself, but since, fortunately, the artists who created these albeit meager relics are barely known, we will investigate them in a later section and discuss the paintings concurrently. Therefore, we will briefly touch upon the murals of the Hōryū-ji (法隆寺) Golden Hall in Japan <15> here.

Among the numerous ancient tombs, those containing murals are extremely rare, numbering barely over ten found near the three old capitals of Goguryeo combined. However, lacking the space to discuss each one here, and as they are mostly similar, we will select the important ones to focus our study. The prevalence of murals seems to belong to the period after King Dongcheon's (東川王) construction of fortifications in Pyongyang (平壤). Observing the chronological distribution of murals based on historical facts of capital relocation, it seems they started around Tonggou (通溝), then moved to the vicinity of Daeseongsan (大城山) east of Pyongyang, and finally to the areas of Yonggang (龍岡) and Gangseo (江西) in the west. However, in reality, most only show faint traces, and assigning definite chronological distinctions is difficult. Therefore, instead of classifying them by geographical and relocation relationships, we will list them based on the superiority or inferiority of technique to facilitate demonstrating the reasons for their development.

The Sashinch'ong (四神塚 - Tomb of the Four Deities) in Maesan-ri (梅山里), Yonggang (龍岡), is already renowned. Its stone chamber, about two *kan* (間 - approx. 3.6 meters) square, features the ingenious Goguryeo ceiling, and the walls were coated with a type of mortar (膠坭) before the paintings were applied. Although the mortar shows some wear, the so-called Four Deities (四神圖) on the four walls are also the oldest paintings in the East. Compared to the murals near Daeseongsan, they are presumed to have been created around 1600 years ago. The Four Deities refer to dividing the 28 constellations of the heavens into four directions, assigning them to Wood, Metal, Fire, and Water, and further personifying them with animals: East is called the Blue Dragon (靑龍), West the White Tiger (白虎), South the Vermilion Bird (朱雀), and North the Black Tortoise-Serpent (玄武). These are considered guardian deities of the four directions and are depicted on the respective walls of the burial chamber. However, on the right side of the North wall's Black Tortoise-Serpent painting, there is a figure painting. To the left, three women sit in a row, and slightly to the right, one man sits upright. Leather shoes are placed in front, decorative pillars stand left and right, and the ceiling curtain is raised, with several tassels hanging above their heads. A man holding a horse waits for his master before the gate. It could also be called a genre painting. The clothing shows no particular difference from later periods. Above the tail of the East wall's Blue Dragon, there is a figure on horseback, and on the West wall lies the famous hunting scene: a hunter on a galloping horse draws his bowstring, chasing two mountain deer. <16> The deer in front glances back with its long neck while fleeing swiftly, creating a lively painting that manifests Goguryeo's characteristics. For this reason, it is sometimes called the Hunting Tomb (獵塚). Although Eastern painting may lack realism, it excels in depicting the vibrant movement of animals. In Goguryeo murals too, besides the Four Deities paintings, the hunting scenes and battle paintings, coupled with their unique temperament, were skillfully rendered.

A tomb depicting a battle scene is the Samsilch'ong (三室塚 - Three-Chamber Tomb) in Amseo (鴨西?), Tonggou (通溝). Constructed with three stone chambers, its Four Deities paintings are superior to the former, showing gradual attention to resemblance in form. On the wall of the first chamber, a battle scene is depicted using a bird's-eye view, often seen in Eastern painting. Some figures on horseback attack each other with long spears, while strong foot soldiers fight fiercely. However, their diminutive size compared to the figures in the fortress walls and watchtowers is a prime example of disregarding realism. The patterns on the corbels (「코-벨」) also show a leap in progress. The presence of lotus patterns suggests it belongs to the period after the introduction of Buddhism. From this, we can infer that Goguryeo murals expressed their ideals not only through figure and animal paintings but also seemed to favor pattern paintings even more, as evidenced by tombs like the Sanyeonhwach'ong (散蓮花塚 - Scattered Lotus Tomb) and Gwiggapch'ong (龜甲塚 - Tortoise Shell Pattern Tomb), which use patterns for their murals.

Moving to the Kamsinch'ong (龕神冢 - Niche Deity Tomb) in Hwasang-ri (花上里), Yonggang, we find a distinctly different style. Parts of the left and right walls of the main chamber are recessed to form niches (龕室), where divine figures are depicted, similar to the figure paintings in the Sashinch'ong. The entire surrounding area is also filled with figure paintings: some sitting, some standing, some kneeling, some with palms together, expressing devout reverence. Notably, in the four corners of the main chamber, large bracket systems (斗拱) are skillfully depicted. Below them, the figures of women standing with palms joined, rendered with simple brushstrokes yet capturing their essence, evoke the sculpted Brahma image (梵天像) in the Sangatsudō (三月堂) Hall of Tōdai-ji Temple in Nara (奈良), Japan. Although numerous differences would surely be found, perhaps, who knows, the latter inherited traditions from the former? Their delicate hands naturally meet near the chest, and the simple red skirts sway slightly backward with the gentle movement of their steps, spontaneously revealing a spirit of pure faith. <17> Interspersed are standing figures of robust men holding weapons, also rendered with simple brushwork achieving妙 (subtlety), vividly depicting the customs of the Goguryeo era. Their attire resembles modern Western clothing, especially military uniforms: a leather belt wraps around the tunic with tube sleeves (筒袖), and particularly, the fine feathers of bird plumes inserted upright on their caps flutter in the gentle warm breeze, presenting a dignified威氣 (aura). This corresponds to historical records:
"Goguryeo (高麗 - referring to 高句麗) men's clothing consists of tube-sleeved tunics (衫) and wide-legged trousers (袴), white leather belts, and yellow leather shoes. Their caps, called *kolso* (骨蘇), are mostly made of purple silk (紫羅), adorned with gold and silver. Those with official rank also insert two bird feathers on top to distinguish themselves."
It can be seen that realism was increasingly emphasized as time progressed. What we find most interesting among the murals of this tomb is the Vermilion Bird (朱雀): male and female face each other left and right, embracing a lovely group of chicks on a lotus petal between them. This is indeed a motif still commonly used today, even after the Yi Dynasty (李朝), on embroidered pillows and cosmetic boxes (裝奩). Though easily overlooked by us as a phoenix pattern, its foundation was already present in the Kamsinch'ong, attempting a distinct style compared to other examples.

As the tendency towards resemblance in form, i.e., realism, gradually reached its peak, the Ssangyŏngch'ong (雙楹塚 - Tomb of the Twin Pillars) near Jinjidong Station (眞池洞驛) was created. Its unique architectural value has already been discussed, but observing its figure paintings and genre scenes, the pursuit of realism is unparalleled in other tombs. On the left and right walls of the entrance passage (羨道), numerous group portraits are painted: there are figures of men and women walking, some on horseback, and valiant warriors carrying bows and arrows, urging swift steeds in gallop. The ox cart scene could form a fascinating single painting: the driver waiting for the master's ride halts the startled ox, and beneath the slightly tilted sunshade behind, an elegant beauty strolls leisurely, still composed. (The above is housed in the Kyŏngsŏng General Museum - 京城總博).
The choice of focal point in the painting is beyond what we could have imagined. This contrast between front and back, even in this small fragment of a mural, vividly expresses the spirit and nature of the Goguryeo people. Their passionate devotion to artistic <18> creation amidst unceasing warfare was not merely an accidental event of the past.
On the walls of the antechamber, there are Four Deities paintings, but due to partial damage, their complete forms are not preserved. The boldness and strength of the brushwork seem to be the origin of later ink wash paintings (水墨畵) that emphasized spirit resonance (氣韻生動) to the extreme, based on the theory of the unity of calligraphy and painting. On the north wall of the rear chamber, there is a portrait of the tomb occupants, a couple, seated serenely on a platform. Pillars stand at both ends, and the ceiling curtain is raised, similar to the Sashinch'ong. However, attendants stand or kneel on either side of the seated figures, creating a delightful variation. This clearly shows the gradual progression from monotony to complexity, from archaic simplicity to realism. The group scene on the east wall of the main chamber features a procession: led by a young girl carrying an incense burner, followed by a monk holding a khakkhara (錫杖 - Buddhist staff), a small woman, a widow seemingly showing a sorrowful expression, a woman looking back, and a boy appearing to say something. At first glance, it is enough to infer that this is a procession for making offerings (供養). The development of figure painting reached a milestone here. Having mastered the subtle methods of realism, the application became effortless. The postures are natural, and the facial expressions break free from the conventional old habits of Eastern painting, showing attention to individual expression. Furthermore, in depicting numerous figures, the composition across the entire surface maintains proper balance, leaving no sense of clutter. Indeed, the procession scene in the rear chamber, combined with its location deep within the main chamber, evokes in us a sense of profound, mysterious spiritual energy. On the corbels (「코-벨」), transformed wave patterns, honeysuckle patterns (忍冬模樣), geometric patterns, cloud patterns, etc., are painted. The honeysuckle pattern, in its arrangement and depiction method, seems to retain the influence of Western Regions (西域) art. On the triangular corbels, there are sun symbols with a three-legged crow (三足烏) and moon symbols with a jade toad (玉蟾). These, along with the Four Deities, are traditional Chinese paintings passed down since ancient times. Particularly, these sun and moon symbols—a sun disc with a three-legged crow and a moon disc with a jade rabbit pounding the elixir of immortality—were reportedly well-painted on pottery and crafts already during the time of the Yellow Emperor (黃帝). In the latter, only the jade rabbit (玉兎) has changed to a jade toad (玉蟾). The lotus pattern painted in the center of the ceiling is the same in both the antechamber and rear chamber. When determining directions, the center is associated with Earth (土), i.e., Yellow (黃). It seems a simple <19> lotus pattern using a warm color was depicted to avoid complexity. Thus, observing the pattern paintings, they exhibit the influence of Western Regions, here meaning Gandhara (간다라), art on top of their inherent painting methods. What about figure painting then? The progress in realism is precisely that. Did they not get the hint from the realism of Gandhara art, which inherited the Greek tradition? Facial expressions have already been mentioned. Regarding men's clothing, a word was said, but women's attire sufficiently suggests it was even more realistic painting. The murals depict women wearing headscarves (首巾) and having trim (襈) attached to the edges of their upper garments. Historical records confirm that the customs of the time were indeed so. The *Haedong Yŏksa* (海東繹史) states:
"Goguryeo women wear headscarves (首巾幗)."
"Goguryeo married women's clothing, skirts (裙), jackets (襦), lower garment edges (裾), and sleeves (袖), all have trim (襈)."
Headscarves are still commonly worn by women in the Western Seon (西鮮 - Northwestern Korea) region today. Their skirts and pleats (裳襞類) are similar, but the fineness and abundance of pleats were far superior, incomparable to today's clothing. The Eastern painting principle of "depicting forms according to objects" (應物像形) nearly achieved realistic painting here, leading later generations to coin the term "transmitting the spirit" (傳神), causing the practical school of objective attitude to create academic painting (術畵) and the subjective literati painting's opposition party (在野黨) to reject it.

The embroidered screen known as the Tenjukoku Mandara Shūchō (天壽國曼陀羅繡帳), preserved today in Chūgū-ji Temple (中宮寺) in Nara (余良?), Japan, transmits the style of these murals. Not only the flower and grass patterns, but also the clothing in the figure depictions reveal similarities at first glance. The figure seated serenely on a flower resembles the tomb occupant in our murals in facial features, even down to the peculiar lines soaring left and right from near the armpits. The kneeling figure behind evokes the figure paintings of the Hwasang-ri Kamsinch'ong. This Mandara embroidered screen was created in the 31st year of Empress Suiko (推古帝) of Japan (5th year of King Yeongnyu (榮留王) of Goguryeo, <20> AD 623), at the request of one of Prince Shōtoku's (聖德太子) consorts to the Empress after the Prince's death. The entire surface depicts numerous tortoise shell patterns (龜甲), and within each shell, the origin of the embroidered screen's production is embroidered in four-character phrases, stating:
"(Beginning and middle omitted) ... ordered the various court ladies (采女) to create two embroidered curtains. The painters were Tōkan no Sue no Kata (東漢末賢 - painter from Eastern Han lineage), Koryŏ Kaseiitsu (高麗加西溢 - painter from Goguryeo), and Kan no Nu no Kakiri (漢奴加己利 - painter from Han lineage?). The supervisor was Kurabu no Hata no Kuma (椋部秦久麻)."
Regarding Koryŏ (Goguryeo) Kaseiitsu (高麗加西溢), there is no record in historical annals, but it can be inferred he was slightly later than the monk Damjing (釋曇徵). Even considering it's embroidery and may not fully represent the original painting's form, its simplicity is undeniable. Compared to our mural figure paintings, the difference is like night and day (雲泥之差).
They cannot be discussed on the same level. In summary, the paintings of the Ssangyŏngch'ong added the influence of Western Regions art to Eastern painting, which emphasizes spirit resonance, showing a strong tendency towards realism, with its influence reaching even distant foreign lands.

However, what changes did this ceaselessly flowing creative genius undergo afterwards? It finally produced a period of maturity (圓熟期). We wish to study the representative masterpiece, the murals of Gangseo Uhyŏn-ri (江西遇賢里), particularly the paintings of the Great Tomb (大墓), which are perfectly preserved and technically outstanding. It is an earth-mound tomb (土圓塚) with a main chamber about 2 *kan* square. The chamber walls are made of polished high-quality granite, smooth enough to reflect faces. The paintings are directly applied to the surface without the addition of mortar seen in other examples. This prevented wall deterioration, and the lines and colors of the Four Deities paintings on the surrounding walls and various patterns on the corbels remain vivid, giving the impression they were painted recently, leaving us utterly astonished and amazed.

The cold, damp air inside the chamber forms dewdrops on the painted surface. The falling drops reflect the faint external light, emitting an unusual brilliance like mica. The Four Deities paintings, embodying unimaginable power through vigorous, lightning-fast lines, seem to float on the ice-like surface of the solid granite for over a thousand years. Standing before the paintings, the pulse, previously dormant in the heart, quickens dramatically, rising to the chest, <21> almost reaching a state of breathlessness. After a moment, one feels an inviolable spiritual majesty pervading the body, followed by the profound, deep breath of steadfast, powerful force. One remains unaware that the pupils, fixed on the wall, have not blinked even once.
Does the mural itself possess a kind of charm? While anyone might agree to deny that something inherently possesses charm, it is also true that affording the luxury of applying theory and approaching it critically is difficult. Only after moving one's feet and composing the mind does one realize that musical, rhythmic lines occupy the entire painted surface, yet remain orderly, and one was entranced by the vigorous power-beauty. Regarding its lineage, it has been repeatedly mentioned. Zhang Yanyuan of the Tang Dynasty stated in his *Lidai Minghua Ji*:
"Gu Kaizhi's (顧愷之) brushwork is tight, strong, and interconnected, circulating and leaping, suddenly changing style, with swift, electric charm. Intent exists before the brush, and intent remains after the painting is finished, thus fully capturing the spirit (神氣). Lu Tanwei (陸探微) also did one-stroke painting, with continuous, unbroken lines. Thus, we know calligraphy and painting use the same brush method. Lu Tanwei's work is precise, sharp, moist, and charming, novel, marvelous, and exquisite, highly renowned in the Song (宋) Dynasty, unequaled at the time."
It is well known that paintings from the Six Dynasties (六朝時代) period are entirely absent in China. The scroll "Admonitions of the Instructress to the Court Ladies" (女史司箴敢告庶姬圖), attributed to Gu Kaizhi and housed in the British Museum, retains a lingering resonance consistent with this description of brushwork. However, judging from incomplete photographs, it's hard to deny Zhang Yanyuan's praise might be excessive. Compared to our murals, it falls short by several levels. Nevertheless, it is an undeniable fact that the painting of that era, which valued such brushwork and revered spirit resonance, greatly influenced the depiction methods of our murals. Later, absorbing the influence of realistic art from the Western Regions, it gradually progressed. Through the genius of our ancestors, it finally reached the realm of harmonious grand synthesis, producing divine works like the murals of this Great Tomb, which represent not only Goguryeo painting but all of Eastern painting.

Regarding the value of line in plastic arts, East and West might seem diametrically opposed, almost mutually incomprehensible at first glance. However, even in the West, the infinite value of line was advocated early on by Lessing (레씽그), the author of "Laokoon" (라오쿤). He stated: Beauty primarily resides within <22> the line; the law of beauty is thus the law of line. Therefore, the presence or absence of beauty lies not in what is expressed, but in how it is expressed. That is, the content itself is not beautiful; beauty resides in the form that expresses this content. Form is the essence of beauty, he argued. Furthermore, asserting that form is nothing but line, he disregarded color and the like, claiming that only the beauty of outlines in line drawings, made with lines, could possess a serene, elegant charm.

Recently, while studying Eastern art in comparison with Western aesthetics, arguments for establishing a unique Eastern aesthetic are not absent. However, someone like Lessing in Germany already emphasized the beauty of line in this manner in the 18th century. Thorough academic theories on this are still rare, although fragmentary publications exist, they inevitably face criticism for incompleteness. Furthermore, for someone of my shallow knowledge to apply this principle to discuss our murals might be called foolish or audacious. I keenly feel that much more investigation remains, which is why I anticipate much from future studies.

A grand mural filling a surface over two *kan* square—even its composition allows a glimpse into the spirit of the Goguryeo people. Among the Four Deities paintings, judging by the use of stone materials and the precision of technique, the one that embodies the utmost artistic intention is the Black Tortoise-Serpent (玄武圖) on this wall. Tortoise and snake are painted together, and the preservation of lines and colors (丹靑) is the most complete among them. Compare this to the Black Tortoise-Serpent in the Middle Tomb (中墓), where the composition is too small relative to the entire wall surface, making the painting and the surface incompatible. The large snake coiled around the rigidly standing tortoise body has not shed the stiffness of its lines, lacking flowing elegance, and depicts a rather intense struggle between the tortoise and snake. In contrast, here we see a swift-moving spiritual tortoise, a spiritual snake winding around it with rhythmic lines—a part of a graceful melody transformed into a painting of vigorous lines, seemingly about to fly off into another world amidst clouds and mist.
The colors, merely variations of the three primary colors, though perhaps limited by the available pigments, paradoxically harmonize <23> with the symbolic theme of these Four Deities paintings, animating their spirit. Twists and graceful curves achieve a marvelous realistic variation, and the beauty of harmony expressed across the entire surface leaves the viewer unable to pinpoint any flaws for criticism. The two heads of the mythical beasts meeting on the faintly shimmering purple-brown tortoise shell reveal sharp teeth, their slender, winding tongues seeming to appeal with spiritual energy towards the boundless sky. Here, there is none of the weak, glaring animosity seen in the Middle Tomb, nor is it merely an expression of desperate agony like that depicted in the Laocoon sculpture of Anrak (安臘? - likely referring to the Vatican Laocoon). It is only the perfect harmony of form and color, and the sublime majesty resonant with its content, transcending the realm of ordinary guardian deities. This can be called an expression of an Eastern Angel.

Westerners, especially the Greeks, excelled ultimately in embodying human suffering, skillfully personifying even the gods of mythology in this manner. However, we Asians express the divine through products of contemplation detached from experience, transcending reality to activate a true life deeply imbued with rich aesthetic value. East and West present a strange contrast. However, the Impressionist movement arose in the West as a reaction against traditional classical painting, and modern painting has come to possess an almost Eastern flavor. It is even said that they gained inspiration from Eastern works exhibited at the Paris Exposition (巴里萬國博覽會) in 1867. Modern people, having become skeptical of the efforts of natural science and finding no satisfaction therein, have shown a growing psychological inclination, eventually welcoming Bergson's (벨그손) theory of intuition. In this context today, our art is not to be compared with the West merely to argue about relative value. Rather, it bears the inherent responsibility of guiding those who stand before its future, seeking understanding. Therefore, it is self-evident and self-assured that we, the Baedal (倍達) race, occupy a preeminent position in the world's art scene through our art. We cannot help but rejoice in advance at the imminent arrival of the day when our great name will be lauded throughout the world as true pioneers of culture.
The corbels (「코-벨」) of this Great Tomb are somewhat superior in structure compared to others. The first layer of corbels is angled, creating simple <24> pendant decorations in the four corners of the wall surface below. Their patterns depict phoenixes, qilin (麒麟), flying heavenly beings (天人), flute-playing immortals (仙女), honeysuckle patterns, etc. On the triangular corbels, a pair of phoenixes are painted after adding honeysuckle patterns onto lotus patterns. Art objects imitating these patterns can also be found at Hōryū-ji in Japan. The wooden phoenixes on the canopy (天蓋) of its Golden Hall match the form of the wings and tails of the phoenixes on the triangular corbels of our Great Tomb. The surviving paintings of immortals (仙人畵) on the ceiling of the same Golden Hall also resemble these murals. Although the tomb's burial goods were stolen mid-century, leaving nothing behind, occasionally discovered fragments of *mitta-e* (密陀繪 - litharge painting) (in the collection of the Yi Royal Family Museum - 李博, Kyŏngsŏng) also testify to the artistic trends of the time. *Mitta-e* refers to paintings made with a type of paint called *mittaseung* (密陀僧), which is lead oxide mixed with oil, to which appropriate pigments are added. It was transmitted from Persia (波斯) through China to Korea, becoming fully Easternized. *Mitta-e* achieved great progress on our broad foundation. The paintings on the doors, rear wall, and four sides of the pedestal of the Tamamushi Shrine (玉蟲廚子), housed in the Hōryū-ji Golden Hall, are the oldest extant examples of *mitta-e* in Japan, and indeed among the oldest and finest paintings overall. The primary colors used in its various depictions—red, yellow, and blue—are identical in nature to the *mitta-e* fragments found in the Gangseo tombs. Other examples of this type of painting are also abundant in the Tachibana Fujin Shrine (橘夫人廚子) at the same Hōryū-ji and in the collection of the Shōsōin (正倉院). Their brushwork and patterns indicate they belong to the lineage of our murals. In Korea, this technique was used until modern times.

Our Goguryeo ancestors, masters of great spirit and possessors of extraordinary skill, assimilated the profound Buddhist thought of India and the marvelous Greco-influenced techniques of the Western Regions into their inherent art, Koreanizing them, and finally produced masterpieces representative of all the East. To call this art characterized by sorrow (悲哀), as some do, is to be dominated by the superficial preconceptions of modern people. It is not worth discussing. Furthermore, those who acknowledge the success of intellectually guided realism in Goguryeo painting but dismiss it as the product of the dry, skillful handiwork of specialized wall decorators <25> are ignorant of the true essence of Eastern painting. The brush method originated from the idea of the unity of calligraphy and painting (書畵一致), and painting themes arose from promoting good and chastising evil (勸善懲惡). It was generally interpreted as the leisure pursuit of scholar-officials. Therefore, artists were either philosophers or literary figures like poets. The reason spirit resonance came to be recognized as the life of painting is also because such artists transcended form and valued limitless inner beauty. Consequently, disregarding the content and merely appreciating the technically mature lines of the exterior, dismissing it as nothing more than conventional skill lacking originality, should be understood as an inappropriate external critique. Profound contemplation, yearning for the great blissful realm of Nirvana, imbued their works with inexhaustible inner beauty.

Alas! Was the nation indeed so short-lived? Where now is the vibrant stage of yesteryear that annexed Liaodong (遼東) and occupied the Heishui (黑水 - Black River) region? The brilliant rulers and outstanding talents rode the white clouds and departed this world long ago. Yet, around the 5th and 6th centuries, an era when Western Europe was still busy establishing hegemonic art nations, the frequent production of representative divine works, formed from the crystallization of Eastern spirit and technique, has only now, after the passage of millennia, become the object of worldly admiration for its supreme value. The buried spiritual brilliance emits dawn's light once again. Can any demon sway the destiny of this devout art nation? Indeed, it is clear they will inevitably praise and kneel before it.—(To be continued)—<26>

**Summary**

This article, part six of a series on Korean art history, focuses on Goguryeo painting. The author, Pak Chonghong, argues that Goguryeo art exemplifies key characteristics of Eastern painting, particularly the emphasis on *giun* (spirit resonance) derived from the unity of calligraphy and painting and influenced by Eastern philosophy. He details several Goguryeo tomb murals (Sashinch'ong, Samsilch'ong, Kamsinch'ong, Ssangyŏngch'ong, Gangseo Daemyo), tracing a development towards greater realism while retaining powerful expressiveness. Pak highlights the Gangseo Great Tomb murals as the pinnacle, representing not just Goguryeo but all Eastern painting, synthesizing native traditions with Gandharan/Western influences. He strongly asserts the unique genius and preeminence of Goguryeo art, noting its influence on Japanese art (Hōryū-ji) and refuting interpretations that dismiss it as merely decorative or sorrowful.

From a colonial history perspective, the article is significant for its strong assertion of Korean cultural identity and artistic achievement during a period of Japanese rule. Pak emphasizes the sophistication, power, and originality of Goguryeo art, positioning it as a source of national pride and a representative of Eastern aesthetics, even suggesting its superiority to contemporaneous Chinese works and its formative influence on early Japanese Buddhist art. Historians might find the nationalist undertones, the specific arguments about artistic lineage and influence (especially regarding Japan), and the framing of Korean art within broader "Eastern" philosophical and aesthetic principles particularly interesting as reflections of Korean intellectual discourse seeking cultural affirmation under colonialism.

朝鮮美術의 史的考察 -
						朴鍾鴻
第二 高句麗 時代의 繪畵
吾人의 繪畵上 特色을 擧할 時에 東洋畵가 筆法(骨法)을 重要示하야 그의 生하는바- 氣韻으로써 繪畵의 第一義되는 主眼點을 作한다함을 暫論하며 그 源由가 大槪 書畵一體의 思想에 根據됨을 幷述하얏도다. 竹簡에 漆로써 塗劃하야 物形을 象하든 時代는 尙且美術品을 作하얏다고까지 言키 難할지며 그래도 東洋에 完全한 繪畵가 生하기는 毛筆의 發明과 紙墨의 製作이 有한 後라고 推想함이 可할지니 毛筆은 그 構造上 頭部가 膨大하며 末端이 細尖하고 性이 柔軟함으로 運筆의 自由를 得하야 彼펜畵나 油繪等의 可히 寫出치 못하는 一種의 力美를 線中에 發할새 漸次 그 特色을 助長하야 書法과 如히 筆法을 云謂케되며 主觀的 氣韻論을 主張케 되도다. 書畵는 材料上 相同할뿐아니라 象形文字도 비록 記憶的 措寫라 할지나 一種의 物形을 象함으로써 創始된 者인즉 書與畵가-이라 稱하는 者까지 生함에 至하얏나니 此는 文字가 象形으로 出하얏스나 純然한 符號的임을 未免함과 反햐야 繪畵는 恒常 事實로부터 그의 立脚地를 創作함을 分別치 못한 綠故라 可히 取할바-아니어니와 更히 그 內容으로 入하야 氣韻論으로부터 兩者의 一致論을 唱하는 者가 出하니 論據를 外面에 置하던 前者와 比하야 一層의 進步를 顯한 者-라 할지로다. 漢字는＜13＞表意的으로 作成된 文字임으로 그 字字가 特異한 意味를 表現하는지라 故로 일즉 그 鑑賞이 盛行하야 書法을 有하되 日用上實際의 必要와 伴하야 長足의 進步를 成하니 晋代에 이미 그의 黃金時代를 作하야 王羲之와 如한 能筆이 出하도다. 元來 主觀的으로 成한 文字가 더욱 書者의 性格과 氣分如何에 依하야 筆法이 各異함으로 楷書, 行書, 草書의 三軆를 作하니 그中 客觀的이며 嚴正한 者는 楷書요, 主觀的이오 幽蕩한 者는 草書라 行書는 그 中間에 位할새 各其劃으로 主하야 線의 動勢를 表現코자하니 力美가 充溢한 者를 優라하며 缺乏한 者를 劣타함은 또한 氣韻을 尙함으로써라 故로 畵家로서 主觀論의 極致를 盡하야 氣韻을 主張코자할진대 不可不書畵의 一致를 論케될지오因하야 書法의 影響이 不少한 者이엇나니 陸探微가 始創한 一筆畵는 王獻之의 婉媚한 一筆書에서 由來함이며 後代에 至하야는 山水畵에 眞,行,草의 三別을 作하야 形式上으로까지 相類한 點이 多하게 되도다.
大槪東洋人은 唯心的 哲學의 思索에 長하니 더욱 神秘함을 崇할새 宗敎가 擧皆東洋에서 出하야 傳播되엇슴으로써도 可知할지로다. 分解하며 綜合하기를 是好하는 歐州人의 科學的思想과는 殊異한 點을 有하야 오즉 自然을 愛慕하며 그에게 抱擁되어 宇宙와 冥合하며 此界를  超越하야 悠悠然其恍惚之間의 樂境을 求함으로써 理想을 삼아오도다. 故로 形式論에 拘束됨을 蛇蝎視하야 極力此를 排하얏나니 重要하다던 倫理의 所謂 德目까지도 老子는 此等의 弊害를 切論하기 不已하얏도다. 唐의 張彦遠이 其著歷代名畵記에 當時의 繪畵의 弊를 論하니 曰
今之晝人, 粗善寫貌, 得其形似則無其氣韻, 具其彩色則失其筆法, 豈曰晝也.
由是觀之컨대 繪畵上形似傳彩를 氣韻生動의 一方便으로 認하얏슴도 無怪한 者-니 客觀的 寫實로부터 그를 超脫하야 主觀的 氣韻의 發露를 爲主함이엇도다. 如斯히 書畵에 그 氣韻을 不可缺이라는 意를 逆行하야 書畵上 그 表＜14＞現된 氣韻 如何로 筆者의 性格과 氣質을 推測한다하야 書를 心의 鎭이라하며 心의 印이라함에 至하니 藝術品에 表現된 藝術家의 人格에 對하야는 此에 云謂할바-아니오 오즉 氣韻으로 繪畵의 生命을 作하얏슴만 知하면 足할가하노라.
以上은 東洋繪畵의 特色인 氣韻을 書法과의 緣由와 哲學的 思想과의 關係로부터 觀察한 者-라. 東洋美術의 特色을 歸納한 者가 이에 朝鮮美術의 特色이라한 吾人은 世界에 無類한 絶寶임을 世人이 皆稱하는 바-우리 美術國의 祖宗인 高句麗人의 遺墨으로써 氣韻上의 理論을 證케되도다. 아니어찌 此等을  證함에 至할 者- 리오更히 氣韻의 圈線을 越하야 寫實과 理想의 反目이 其影을 消去한 神品을 出하도다.
東洋畵 더욱 그의 古代繪畵는 紙類가 發見된 後에도 運筆의 自由에 便한 縑素를 善用하야 畵軸을 成함이 多하얏스나 于今에 傳하는 者-殆無함은 勿論이오 大建築物의 壁畵로서도 頹廢의 甚함으로 因하야 本形을 保留함이 稀貴하도다. 然이나 不得已 稀貴하다는 壁畵의 遺痕이나마 茲에 收拾具聚하야써 一般 繪畵의 推移, 變遷의 經路를 聯測코자 하노라. 大槪 高句麗의 繪畵는 그 遺存上의 殊異點과 技巧上의 理想에 依하야 二者로 分함을 得할지니 一은 半島內에 在하야 地下幽室의 壁畵를 成하고 一은 扶桑의 島國에 在하야 巨刹金堂의 壁畵를 成하며 一은 北方의 純武風的繪畵로서 雄渾한 氣韻을 顯하고 一은 敬虔한 信仰의 發露인 佛畵로서 慈悲한 靈韻을 發하도다. 그 何者나 高句麗의 異彩를 表치 아니함이 잇스리오마는 더욱 建築上의 特色과 相通하는 點이 多하며 氣質의 特長을  一層 表示하얏슴은 半島古墳內의 壁畵라 할지로다. 繪畵라는 題下에서 論치 못함은 少許의 遺憾이 不無하나 貧弱한 遺物이나마 創作한 美術家가 萬幸으로 僅傳함이 잇기로 後題에서 그를 考究하며 同時에 繪畵도 幷論하기로하야 此에서는 扶桑＜15＞法隆寺 金堂壁畵를 略하기로 하엿노라.
許多한 古墳中에도  壁畵를 有하는 者는 極稀하야 高句麗의 三舊都 附近에 發見된 者-合하야 僅히 十餘를 算함에 不過하도다. 然이나 此에 一一이 論據할 餘裕를 有치 못하고 또 거의 相類한 者이기로 그中 重要한 者를 擧하야 考究에 充코자 하노니 壁畵의 盛行은 東川王의 平壤築城以後에 屬하는 듯하도다. 壁畵分布의 年代를 歷史上 遷都의 事實에 依하야 觀察하면 通溝附近으로 爲始하야 平壤東部 大城山附近, 西部 龍岡, 江西 附近에 至하얏슬듯하나 其實은 大槪가 그 形跡을 微顯할 따름이오 確實한 年代의 區別은 附키 難한 者-라 故로 그 地理와 遷都上의 關係로써 類別함을 不取하고 그 發達한 因由를 證하기에 便하도록 技巧의 優劣로부터 此를 列擧코자 하노라.
龍岡梅山里 四神塚은 그 貴名을 이미 傳하는바- 어니와 二間餘立方의 石室은 巧妙한 高句麗의 天井을 有하고 壁面에는 一種의 膠坭 Mortar. 를 塗한後 繪畵를 描寫하얏스니 그 膠坭의 磨滅이 不無하나 四方 壁面에 所謂 四神圖는 또한 東洋 最古의 繪畵로 大城山附近의 壁畵에 推하야 約 1600年前에 成한 者라고 假定하는바-로다. 四神이라함은 天의 28宿를 四方으로 分하야 木金火水에 配하고 更히 此를 動物로써 具象化할새 東은 曰 靑龍, 西는 曰 白虎요 南은 朱雀, 北은 玄武라 稱하니 即 四方의 守護神이라 하야 各各 玄室壁面에 描出함이로다. 然而 北壁玄武圖 右側에 人物畵가 有하니 左便에 3人의 婦人이 列坐하고 小距한 右便에 1人의 男子가 端坐하도다. 前面에 革履를 置하고 左右에는 飾柱를 立하며 天井의 「카-텐」은 已擧하니 數筯의 流蘇가 頭上에 垂下할새 牽馬의 一漢子-門前에 主人을 待하도다. 一幅의 風俗畵라고도 可稱할지오. 衣裳은 後代와 異點이 別無하며 東壁 蒼龍의 尾上에는 騎馬人物이 有하고 西壁에는 有名한 狩獵圖가 在하니 疾走하는 騎馬上에 獵人이 弓絃을 張하며 二匹의 山鹿을 追할새＜16＞ 前方의 一匹은 그의 長頸으로 廻顧하며 疾驅하는 等 高句麗의 特色을 顯한 活畵를 作하도다. 是以로 或云獵塚이라하니 東洋畵는 寫實에 缺함이 有하나 動物等의 活勢를 描寫함에는 長하야 高句麗의 壁畵에 在하야서도 四神圖등은 勿論이오 그 特殊한 氣質과 伴하야 狩獵圖나 戰爭畵를 善寫하얏도다.
戰爭畵를 描出한 者는 鴨西 通溝의 三室塚이라. 3個의 石室로써 造成되니 四神의 圖는 前者에 比하야 優秀한 者요. 漸次 形似에도 留意하얏슴을 可知할지라. 第1室 壁面에 戰亂의 景을 寫할새 東洋畵에서 屢見하는바-一種의 俯瞰圖를 作하니 馬上에 跨하야 長矛로 相攻하는 者도 有하며 彊勇한 步戰者가 相鬪하기도 하나 그 城廓과 櫓樓의 人物에 比하야 過小함은 寫實을 不顧한 好適例라할지로다. 「코-벨」의 紋樣等도 一躍의 進步를 顯한 者-니 蓮花模樣等이 有함으로써 보건대 佛敎 傳來以後에 屬할 者인듯하도다. 由是觀之컨대 高句麗의 壁畵가 人物畵나 動物畵뿐으로 그 理想을 表現함이 아니라 模樣畵等을 一層 愛好한듯하니 散蓮花塚, 龜甲塚等의 紋樣으로 壁畵를 作햐엿슴도 此를 證하는 者-라할지로다.
龍岡花上里 龕神冢에 至하면 一種의 別趣를 有하는 者-라. 玄室左右壁의 一部가 凹入하야 龕室을 作하고 神像을 描出할새 是亦 四神冢의 人物畵와 相類하고 그 周圍全面에도 人物畵를 寫하니 或坐或立하며 或足을 跪하고 或掌을 合하야 敬虔의 誠을 表하도다. 特히 玄室 四隅에는 巨大한 斗拱을 巧妙하게 描出하엿스며 그下에 合掌而立한 女人의 像을 簡略한 筆數로써 眞을 得하니 扶桑奈良의 東大寺三月堂內 梵天像의 彫塑物을 想起케하는지라 勿論 多數한 殊異點을 發見할지나 或은 不知케라. 彼가 此等의 傳統을 受한자이 아닌가. 그 纖媚한 兩手는 天然스럽게 胸邊에서 相合하고 純朴한 紅裳은 徐移하는 步運에 依하야 後面으로 稍斜하니 淸雅한 信仰의 精이 스스로 流露하도다.＜17＞ 間間 武器를 執한 丈夫의 立像을 寫하니 또한 單純한 筆法으로 妙를 顯하되 高句麗 當時의 風習을 裸裸하게 描出하얏도다. 服裝은 今日의 洋服 特히 軍服과 似하니 筒袖의 上衣上에 革帶를 繞하며 더욱 冠上에 揷立한 鳥羽의 纖毛는 微聲의 暖風에 飄飄하니 威氣가 堂堂한 者-라. 史記의 傳하는 바와 相符하니 曰
高麗(高句麗를 指稱)丈夫衣同(혹 作筒)袖衫大口袴, 白革帶, 黃革履, 其冠 曰骨蘇, 多以紫羅爲之, 雜以金銀爲飾, 其有官品者, 又揷二鳥羽於其上, 以顯異之.
時代가 漸次 下함을 隨하야 寫實에 尤益留意하얏슴을 可知할지로다. 吾人이 此塚의 壁畵中 一層 趣味를 感하는 바-는 朱雀이니 左右로 雌雄이 相面하고 그中間 蓮瓣上에 可愛한 雛群을 擁함이라. 此는 實로 李朝를 經한 今日에까지 尙且繡枕이나 裝奩等의 紋樣으로 常用하는 者-로다. 鳳凰의 模樣이라하야 吾人의 平素看過키 易한 此라도 基本이 벌서 龕神塚에 在하얏나니 他例에 比하야 別法을 試한 者-라할진저.
形似를 主하는 即 寫實의 傾向이 漸次 高潮에 達할새 이에 眞池洞驛附近의 雙楹塚을 做出하니 建築上 그의 特異한 價値는 이미 論하얏거니와 人物畵, 風俗畵로 觀察하야 그 寫實에 眞追함은 可히 他塚에 類例를 得키 難한바-로다. 羨道 左右 壁面에는 無數한 人物의 群像을 畵하니 徒步하는 男女의 像도 有하며 或은 騎馬人物도 有하고 或은 弓矢를 負한 勇士가 駿騏를 促하야 疾驅도 하도다. 牛車와 如함은 多趣한 一幅畵를 可成할자-니 主人의 乘駕를 待하는 馭者-驚牛를 停하고 後面으로 稍傾한 遮日下에는 高雅한 美人이 閒步를 徐移하니 오히려 泰然하도다.(以上은 京城總博에 藏)
그 繪畵의 契點을 擇함이어 吾人의 可히 想像치 못하엿던바-로다. 前後의 相對가 如斯함은 些少한 壁畵의 此 一片에서나마 歷歷히 高句麗人의 氣象과 性質을 表現한 者-니 干戈의 收戢을 夢치 못하든 그中에서도 悠悠然美術的＜18＞ 創作에 熱注하얏슴도 偶然한 過去事가 아니엇도다.
前室 壁面에 四神圖가 有하나 一部의 破損으로 因하야 全形을 未具하니 그 筆勢의 大膽雄健함은 書畫一致論으로부터 氣韻生動을 極致로 主張한 後世의 水墨畵를 做出成來케한 原油인듯하도다. 後室北壁에는 主人夫婦의 臺上에 安坐한 畵像이 有하니 兩端에 柱를 立하며 天井의 「카-텐」을 擧한 等은 四神塚과 似하나 坐像 左右에 侍人이 或跪或立하야 變化의 妙를 作하얏슴은 單調로부터 複雜에, 古拙로부터 寫實에, 漸次進步한 形跡이 確然한 者-라할지로다. 玄室 東壁의 群像은 香爐를 戴한 童女를 先頭로 錫杖을 執한 僧侶, 小型의 女子, 愁然의 貌를 現한듯한 未亡人, 更히 後를 顧하는 女人, 무엇을 云謂하는 듯한 男兒等이 그後로 從하니 一見供養의 行列임을 推想함에 足하도다. 人物畵의 進步는 이에 一段落을 作케된자-니 寫實의 妙法을 軆得하야 運用이 自在할새 그 起居의 姿態가 自然스러우며 그 顔面의 表情이 東洋畵의 因習的舊弊를 脫하야 個性의 表現에 留意하얏슴이로다. 또 數多한 人物을 描出함에 全面의 布置에 對하야서도 適度를 不失하야 亂雜의 憚을 留함이 別無하니 오히려 後室의 供養의 行列과 如함은 그 深奧한 玄室내의 位置와 倂하야 吾人으로 하야곰 一種의 幽遠不可思議한 靈氣를 感케하도다. 「코-벨」上에는 變形한 波紋樣, 忍冬模樣, 幾何學的模樣, 雲模樣等을 寫하니 忍冬模樣과 如함은 配置와 描寫法等이 西或美術의 影響을 留한 者인듯하며 三角形의 「코-벨」上에는 三足烏의 日象, 玉蟾의 月象이 有하니 此는 四神圖와 共히 古來로 中國의 傳襲的繪畫라. 더욱 此의 日象 月象은 黃帝時代에 三脛의 烏를 有한 日輪, 不死의 妙樂을 搗하는 玉兎가 在한 月輪을 이미 陶器나 工業品等에 善畵하얏다하니 後者는 오즉 玉兎가 玉蟾으로 變하얏슬뿐이라. 天井 中央에 蓮花模樣을 寫하얏슴은 前後室이 相同하니 方位를 定한 時에 中은 土 即 黃이라하야 煩雜을 避한 暖色으로써 單調한＜19＞ 蓮花紋樣을 描出함인듯하도다. 如斯히 模樣畵로 觀察할진대 그 固有한 畵法上에 西域 即 此에는「간다라」美術의 影響을 顯한 者라할지니 然則 人物畵로는 如何한가. 寫實的方面의 進步가 是也니 希臘의 系統을 繼한 「간다라」美術의 寫實的임에서 그 「힌트」를 得함이 아닌가하노라. 人物의 表情等은 前者에 已擧하얏스며 男子의 服裝에 就하야서도 一言하얏거니와 女子의 衣裳에 至하면 一層 寫實的 繪畫이엇슴을 十分 推想함에 足하니 壁畵에 그 首巾을 周하며 上衣의 未端애 襈을 附한 婦女子를 寫하얏스되 當時의 風俗이 또한 如斯하얏슴을 記하야 傳하니 海東繹史에 曰
高麗女子, 首巾幗.
高麗婦人, 服裙襦裾袖, 皆爲襈.
首巾은 今日까지도 西鮮地方의 婦女가 常用하는바요. 그 裳襞類도 相似하나 纖密細多함은 一層 優麗한 者-니 今者의 衣裳類에 比할바-아니엇도다. 東洋畵의 應物像形法이 此에 至하야 거의 寫實畵를 成하니 後代에 所謂 傳神이라하야 客觀的 態度의 實際派로하야곰 術畵를 創케하고 主觀的文人畵의 在野黨으로 하야곰 此를 排斥함에까지 至케한 者-라.
此 壁畵의 形式을 傳하야 于今에 保存되어 잇는 扶桑余良中宮寺의 所藏인 天壽國曼陀羅의 繡帳이 是라. 花草의 模樣等은 勿論이요 人物圖의 衣裳과 如함도 一見에 그 相類함을 發見할지며 花上에 整坐한 人物은 그 顔形이 우리 壁壁中의 主人과 似하고 甚至於 兩腋附近으로부터 一種 殊異한 線이 左右에 翔揚함까지 恰似하며 後面에 跪坐한 人物圖는 花上里龕神塚의 人物畵를 聯想케하도다. 此 曼陀羅의 繡帳은 日本推古帝31年(高句麗 榮留王 5年,＜20＞ 紀623年) 聖德太子가 逝去하매 其妃의 一人이 王에게 願햐야 造成된 者-라. 全幅에 허다한 龜甲을 象하고 甲內에 四字式繡帳의 製作된 由來를 繡出하니 曰
(前中皆略)敕諸采女等, 造繡帷二帳, 畵者東漢末賢, 高麗加西溢, 又漢奴加己利, 令者椋部秦久麻.
高麗(高句麗)加西溢에 對하야는 史記에 傳함이 無하나 釋曇徵보다 稍後함은 可知할지요. 繡物인 關係上 其原畵의 形을 現치 못하얏다할지라도 그의 簡拙함은 未免할지니 우리의 壁畵 人物圖와는 雲泥의 差를 有하는 者-라.
同日之論이 아닐진저. 以上 雙楹塚의 繪畵는 氣韻을 主要視하는 東洋畵에 西域 美術의 感化를 加味하며 寫實的 傾向을 多顯하니 遙遠한 他邦에까지 그 影響이 傳及하얏슴이로다.
然而滾滾不絶한 創造的 靈才는 其後如何한 變遷을 有하는 者인가, 듸디어 圓熱期를 做出하고야 巳하니 代表的 傑作으로 江西遇賢里의 壁畵 더욱 其中에서도 保存이 完全하며 技巧가 特秀한 大墓의 繪畵에 就하야 考究코저 하노라. 方 約2間의 玄室을 有한 土圓塚이니 玄室 壁面은 良質의 花崗石을 塚磨하야 成할새 오히려 顔形을 映함에 足할듯하고 繪畵는 그 表面에 直寫하야 他例에 見하든바-膠坭와 如함은 此를 添塗함이 無하니 壁面의 頹落을 可免하야 周圍의 四神圖「코-벨」上의 各種 文樣의 描線, 色彩가 鮮明할새 頃日에 畵한듯한 感을 起케함은 吾人의 愕然히 驚嘆치 아니치 못하는 바-로다.
室內의 寒冷한 水氣는 畵面上에 露滴을 作하고, 落下하는 그 露滴은 熹微한 外光을 反射하야 雲母와 似한 異彩를 發하니 勁健, 電疾한 線으로써, 不可思議한 力을 具體化한 四神圖는 千數百年間 堅固한 花崗石의 氷과 類한 表面에 浮動하도다. 畵面을 對하아 佇立하는 者-心裡에 潛黙하얏든 脈動이 急激한 胍動을 作하며 胸部로부터 上昇하야＜21＞ 오히려 喘息의 境에 至하얏다가 少焉에 不可犯할 靈威가 身에 追함을 感할지며 更히 蘊奧裡에 沈着强雄한 力의 呼吸을 送할 뿐이요. 壁面에 直注한 瞳孔의 半瞬도 不作하얏슴을 未覺할지로다.
一種의 魅力을 壁畵 스스로가 有함인가, 何某나 魅力을 本有하얏다함은 此를 否認함에 贊同하려니와 하여튼 그에다 理論을 附하야 批評的으로 對할 餘裕들 有키 難함도 事實이라. 오즉 步를 運하야 心을 整한 後라야 音樂的 情緖와도 似한 「리즘이칼」의 線이 塗面 全部를 占하야 오히려 整然하며 勁健한 力美에게 恍惚하얏섯슴을 認識함에 至할지로다. 系統에 就하야는 屢屢已述하얏거니와 唐朝張彦遠의 歷代 名畵記에 云.
顧愷之之迹, 緊勁聯線, 循環超忽, 調格一易, 風趣電疾, 意存筆先, 畵盡意在, 所以全神氣也. 陸探微亦作一筆畵, 連線不斷, 故知書畵用筆同法, 陸探微精利潤媚, 新奇妙絶, 名高宋代, 時無    等論.
六朝時代의 繪畵가 中國에 全無함은 世人의 斟酌하는바-어니와 顧愷之의 遺墨이라 傳하는 英國博物館 所藏의 女史司箴敢告庶姬圖는 그 運筆의 法이 此 畵論과 相符하는 바 遺韻을 留하나 不完全한 寫眞으로써 察컨대 張彦遠의 過讚이 不無라 云키 難할지니 吾人의 壁畵와 比하야 數段의 遜色을 有한 者-라하노라. 然이나 此等 筆法을 重要視하야 氣韻을 崇하든 當代의 繪畵가 우리 壁畵의 描寫法에 多大한 影響을 及하얏슴은 可히 蔽치 못할 事實일지요. 그後 西域의 寫實的美術의 感化를 納하야 漸次 進步할새 吾人의 先祖의 靈才로 듸디어 渾融大成의 域에 至하니 高句麗의 繪畵를 代表하는, 아니 東洋畵를 代表하는 此 大墓의 壁畵와 如한 神品을 做出케하얏슴이로다.
造形美術上 線條의 價値에 對하야서는 一見 東西洋이 互相理解치 못하리 만큼 相反하는 者인듯하나 西歐에서도 일즉「라오쿤」Laokoon의 著者「레씽그」Lessing에 依하야 線條의 無限한 價値는 唱道케되도다. 彼는 曰, 美는 線條내에＜22＞ 主存하는 것이니 美의 法則은 即 線條의 法則이 有하나니라. 故로 美의 有無는 表現된 者의 何物임에 不在하고 表現法의 如何에 在하니 即 內容 其物이 美함이 아니요 美는 是의 內容을 表出하는 바 形式에 在하다 論하얏도다. 形式은 美의 本性이라 함이요. 더욱 形式은 線條에 不外하다하야 色彩와 如함을 等閑視하며 線條로 成한 線畵의 輪廓美라야 可히 沈靜, 典雅한 風趣를 具하는 者-라 함이로다.
近日 西洋美學과 對하야 東洋美術을 硏究함에는 東洋의 獨特한 美學의 創設을 要한다는 論도 不無할지나 獨逸의 「레씽그」와 如함은 18世紀에 在하야 이미 線條의 美를 如斯히  重要視하얏도다. 此에 對하야는 아즉도 徹底한 學說을 立함이 稀少함은 勿論이요 斷片的으로나마 發表함은 不無하되 不完全하다는 評을 難免할지라. 더구나 淺識한 予가 此의 法을 스스로 則하야 우리의 壁畵를 論한다함은 愚拙한 事라 할는지 大膽한 行이라 할는지 尤溢考究할 點의 殘留함을 切感하는바-어니와 이또한 後日에 期하는 바가 多한 所以로다.
二間餘平方의 畵面에 彌滿한 大壁畵, 그의 布置法에서도 高句麗人의 氣象을 可窺할 者-요. 그 中 石材의 用法으로 推하야 技巧의 精密함으로 測하야 四神圖中 가장 그의 意匠을 盡한 者는 此 壁의 玄武圖라. 龜蛇를 幷畵하니 線條와 丹靑의 保存이 그中 完全한 者-라. 此를 中墓의 玄武가 全壁面에 比하야 過小한 布局을 成하얏슴은 畵面과 繪畵가 相容치 못하게 하얏스며 兀立한 龜軀를 蜷圍한 大蛇는 線의 固醜味를 未脫하야 流暢한 雅趣를 缺하고 더욱 龜蛇의 相爭이 滋甚한 狀을 作하얏슴에 此할진대, 疾走하는 靈龜, 律調的의 線으로 그를 蟠繞한 靈蛇, 嫋嫋한 樂曲의 一部가 勁健한 線條의 繪畵로 化하야 將次 雲霞裡의 別世界로 飛去하려는 듯하도다.
三原色의 變調에 不過한 色彩는 그 原科의 制限을 비록 受하얏스나 題意가 象徵的인 此 四神圖에 在하야는 돌이어＜23＞互相一致하야 그 精神을 生動케하는 者-라. 捻轉과 婉曲을 半하야 寫實的變化의 妙를 得하고 全面에 表現된 調和의 美는 鑑賞者로 하야금 可히 批評할 欠點을 摘指치 못하게하도다. 熹微하게 浮動하는 紫褐色龜甲上에 相會한 奇獸의 兩頭는 銳尖한 齒牙를 顯하며 細曲한 長舌은 無窮한 天空을 向하야 靈氣로써 呼訴함과 似하니 此에는 中墓에서 見하는 바-貧弱한 疾視의 陋도 勿論無하며 安臘의 「라오콘」彫像이 現한 바- 切實한 苦惱뿐으로 表現한 者와도 亦是 判異하도다. 오즉 圓滿無碍한 形似賦彩와 그 內容에 相通하는 崇高의 威韻이 尋常한 守護神의 境을 超脫한 者-니 此는 可謂 東洋的天使의 表現이라 할지로다.
西歐 더욱 希臘人은 終末까지 人間苦를 具象化함에 長하야 神話의 諸神도 此法으로써 擬함에 能하얏스나 吾人은 經驗을 離한 冥想의 所産으로써 神異함을 表現할새 現實을 脫하야 오히려 豊僥한 美的價値를 深藏한 眞實의 生命을 活躍케하니 東西가 奇異하게도 相對하는 바-로다. 然이나 從來의 「클라씨크」畵의 反動으로 西洋에 印象派가 勃興하야 近代的 繪畵가 거의 東洋的 趣味를 有함은 西紀 1867年 巴里萬國博覽會에 出品된 東洋의 作品에 暗示를 得하얏다고까지 傳하며 自然科學의 努力을 疑心케된 近代人은 그에서 滿足을 未得하고 漸次 心理的 傾向이 增長하야 듸디어 「벨그손」Bergson의 直覺說을 歡迎케된 今日 吾人의 美術은 價値의 相對를 論키 爲하야 西歐와 比할바-아니요. 그 前途에 立하야 理解코저하는 彼等을 引導할 本性的 責任을 負하도다. 故로 吾人은 우리 倍達의 種族이 그 美術로서 卓越한 位置로 世界의 藝苑에 處하앗슴이 自明하며 自確하니 眞實한 文化의 先驅者로 天下에 그 偉名이 稱嘆될 時日의 不遠함을 미리 欣悅하기 不已하는 바-로다.
此 大墓의 「코-벨」은 그 構造가 他에 比하야 稍秀한 者-니 第 1層의 「코-벨」을 折하야 그 下側 壁面四隅에 簡單한＜24＞ 垂飾을 作하얏스며 그 文樣에는 鳳凰, 麒麟, 飛翔하는 天人, 吹笛하는 仙女, 忍冬模樣等을 描出하얏스며 三角形의 「코-벨」上에는 蓮花模樣上에 忍冬模樣을 添寫한 後 一雙의 鳳凰을 畵하얏도다. 此等 文樣을 模倣한 美術品을 扶桑法隆寺에서 또한 發見할지니, 彼 金堂天蓋의 木造 鳳凰은 우리 大墓 三角形「코-벨」上의 鳳凰과 羽尾의 形式이 相符하는 者-요. 同金堂天井에 僅存된 仙人畵도 此의 壁畵와 似한 者-며 塚內의 副葬品은 中年에 盜難을 當하야 一物도 遺存됨이 無하나 間或 發見되는 密陀繪의 破片(京城 李博藏)은 또한 當代 美術의 經路를 證하는 者-라. 密陀繪라함은 酸化畵鉛에 油를 混合하고 更히 此에 適當한 色素를 和한, 所謂 密陀僧이라는 一種의 塗料로써 圖한 繪畵를 稱함이니 波斯로부터 中國을 經하야 朝鮮에 傳來할새 이에 全 東洋的으로 化한 密陀繪는 吾人의 濶漫한 地盤上에 一大 進步를 遂了하도다. 法隆寺 金堂內에 安置된 玉蟲廚子의 扉, 後壁及臺坐의 四面에 在한 繪畵는 日本에 現存한 密陀畵中 最古한 者-요. 더욱 繪畵中에서도 最舊最優한 者-니 그諸圖에 用한 配色은 赤黃靑이 그 主要色이어니와 그의 性質이 江西古墳에서 發見된 密陀繪와 全然 同一한 者-라. 其他同 法隆寺의  橘夫人廚子와 正倉院의 所藏品等에 此種의 繪畵가 亦多하니 그 筆法과 文樣等이 우리 壁畵의 系統을 受한 者-라한지며 朝鮮에 在햐야는 此法이 近代에까지 通用되엇섯도다.
偉大한 精神의 主人이며 非凡한 手腕의 所有者인 우리 高句麗人은 그 本有의 美術에 幽邃한 印度의 佛敎的思想과 神妙한 西域의 希臘系統의 技巧를 容하며 朝鮮化하야 듸디어 東洋의 全 代表的 傑作을 出하얏나니 此로 하야금 悲哀의 特性을 有하는 者-라함과 如함은 近代人의 外觀上 先入見에 支配된 者-라. 不可與言이어니와 高句麗繪畫의 理知的 寫實의 成功을 是認하면서도 그로하야금 特殊한 壁面裝飾職工의 無味乾燥한 達腕의 所産이라하는 者는 또한＜25＞ 東洋畵의 眞趣를 不知하는 者-라 할지니 書畵一致의 思想으로부터 出한 筆法이요 勸善懲惡으로부터 生한 畵題를 有하얏섯는지라 大槪가 文士의 餘技로 解釋하얏나니 故로 美術家는 이에 哲學家가 아니면 詩人과 如한 文士이엇도다. 氣韻을 繪畵의 生命으로 認識케된 所以도 此等의 美術家가 形式을 超越하야 無限한 內在美를 尙하얏슴으로써라 할지요. 딸하 그內容은 不問而除하고 오즉 外形의 圓熟한 線條를 賞하야 獨創을 缺한 傳習的 練達에 不外하다함이 不當한 外論에 不過함을 斟酌할지로다. 涅槃의 大歡樂境을 憧憬하는 蘊奧한 冥想은 그 作品에 無盡한 內在美를 寓하얏섯도다.
鳴呼 國家는 果然 短促한 者인가. 遼東을 略하고 黑水를 占하얏든 當年의 活舞臺는 今에 安在오 英主傑士는 白雲을 乘하고 此界를 辭한지 巳久하도다. 오즉 五六世紀頃 西歐에서는 아즉도 覇王的美術國을 建設함에 汲汲하든 時代에 이미 東洋의 精神과 技巧의 結晶으로 成한 代表的神品을 頻出하얏슴은 星霜의 轉替가 幾千劫을 經한 今日에 至하야 비롯오 그 至高한 價値는 世人의 欽仰의 的이 되엇스며 埋沒되엇든 靈彩는 다시 曙光을 發하니 敬虔한 美術國의 運命은 如何한 惡魔라도 此를 左右치 못할뿐인가. 돌이어 그를 讚頌하며 跪拜치 아니치 못할 것임을 可知할지로다.-(未完)-＜26＞
