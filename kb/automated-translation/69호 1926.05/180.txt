Spring Evening Thoughts
Ch'oe To

Water flows, flowers fall, both heartless,
Sending off the east wind past the Ch'o Fortress.
In a butterfly dream, home is ten thousand leagues away,
On the cuckoo's branch, the moon marks the third watch.
Letters from my old garden ceased years ago,
White hair born of spring partings fills the mirror.
It's not that I don't return; I could if I wished,
But who would contest the misty scenery of the Five Lakes?

Spring Banquet East of the City
Ch'oe Min-tong

One year passes, and another spring comes,
But among a hundred years, there's no hundred-year-old person.
How many times can one get drunk among the flowers?
Spend ten thousand cash on wine; don't plead poverty.

By the Same Author
Ch'oe Hye-tong

How many times does the host smile in a month?
Meeting by chance, let's just hold our cups.
Watch the spring colors flow by like water,
Today's fading flowers bloomed only yesterday.

Hearing a Flute in Luoyang City on a Spring Night
Yi Paek

Whose jade flute's sound flies darkly?
Scattering on the spring breeze, it fills Luoyang City.
Tonight, hearing "Breaking the Willow Branch" in the melody,
Who wouldn't feel longing for their old garden?

Presented to a Beauty on the Roadside By the Same Author

A proud horseman treads on fallen blossoms,
His dangling whip brushes straight past the five-cloud chariot.
The beauty smiles, lifting the pearl curtain,
Pointing afar to a red tower, "That is my home."

Boudoir Lament
Wang Ch'ang-nyŏng

The young wife in her chamber knows no sorrow,
On a spring day, she adorns herself and ascends the jade tower.
Suddenly seeing the willow colors by the roadside path,
She regrets urging her husband to seek noble rank.

Spring Thoughts
Ka Chi

Grass color green, green; willow color yellow,
Peach blossoms scattered, plum blossoms fragrant.
The east wind does not blow away sorrow,
Spring days seem especially able to draw out long regrets.

Farewell in Late Spring
Han Chong

Green deepens, red fades, leaving the Phoenix City,
Beyond the evening clouds, palace walls hold feelings ancient and modern.
Traveler, do not listen to the water before the palace,
Its sound sends off the passing years entirely.

Palace Lament
Sama Rye

Willow colors, uneven, hide the painted tower,
Dawn orioles sing, sending sorrow throughout the palace.
Year after year, flowers fall unseen,
Vainly following the spring stream out of the imperial moat.

Udjo Ijung Taeyŏp
Hwang Hŭi

Above the clear stream, outside the grass-thatched hall, why does spring linger so late?
Pear blossoms are white snow fragrance, willow color is tender gold.
Amidst the sounds of ten thousand flowers and the cuckoo's cry, spring thoughts are boundless.

By the Same Author *Unknown Name

In the empty mountain's solitude, O weeping cuckoo,
The rise and fall of the Shu kingdom isn't just yesterday or today.
Why do you still cry bloodily, tearing at others' hearts?

Kyemyŏn Ijung Taeyŏp
Im Paek-ho

In the valley overgrown with fragrant grass, the stream flows weeping.
Where, oh where are the singing stages and dancing halls?
Swallow dipping into the water at sunset, I wonder if you know.

Kyemyŏn Isusu Yŏp
Yi Kyu-bo

The sun is warm, the wind is gentle, the birds' songs are harmonious.
Amidst the fallen flowers filling the courtyard, I lie leisurely.
Perhaps today in this mountain home is the Great Peace. <85>

**Summary**

This article presents a collection of poems, mostly classical Chinese works by renowned Tang dynasty poets, alongside several Korean poems (*sijo* and *kasa*-like forms) by notable figures like Hwang Hŭi, Yi Kyu-bo, Im Paek-ho, and an anonymous author. The unifying theme is "Late Spring" (暮春), exploring feelings of transience, nostalgia, the beauty of nature, sorrow, and longing often associated with the season's end. For historians, the piece is interesting as it reflects the literary tastes of early 20th-century Korea, showcasing the continued appreciation of classical Chinese literature alongside Korean vernacular poetry within a prominent colonial-era journal like *Kaebyŏk*. The selection, mixing famous Chinese verses with Korean works on similar themes, highlights the cultural dialogue and the effort to position Korean literary traditions within a broader East Asian context during a period of national identity formation under colonial rule.

暮春雜俎
春夕張懷
崔塗

水流花謝兩無情, 送盡東風過楚城. 蝴蝶夢中家萬里, 子規枝上月三更. 故園書動經年絶, 華髮春離滿鏡生. 自是不歸歸便得, 五湖烟景有誰爭.

城東春宴
崔敏童

一年又過一年春, 百歲曾無百歲人. 能向花中幾回醉, 十千沽酒莫辭貧.

仝
崔惠童

一月主人笑幾回, 相逢相値且含盃. 眼看春色如流水, 今日殘花昨日開.

春夜洛城聞笛
李白

誰家玉笛暗飛聲, 散入春風滿洛城. 此夜曲中聞折柳, 何人不起故園情.

陌上贈美人 仝上

駿馬驕行踏落花, 垂鞭直拂五雲車. 美人一笑褰珠箔, 遙指紅樓是妾家.

閨怨
王昌齡

閨中少婦不知愁, 春日凝粧上翠樓. 忽見陌頭楊柳色, 悔敎夫婿覓封侯.

春思
賈至

草色靑靑柳色黃, 桃花歷亂李花香. 東風不爲吹愁去, 春日偏能惹恨長.

暮春送別
韓琮

綠暗紅稀出鳳城, 莫雲宮闕古今情. 行人莫廳宮前水, 流送年光盡此聲.

宮怨
司馬禮

柳色參差掩畵樓, 曉鶯啼送滿宮愁. 年年花落無人見, 空逐春泉出御溝.

羽調二中大葉
黃喜

淸溪上草堂外에, 봄은 어이 느젓는고, 梨花白雪香이오, 柳色黃金嫩이로다, 萬花群蜀魄聲中에 春思-茫然하여라.

仝 *名氏

空山이 寂寞한데 슬피우는 저 杜鵑아 蜀國興亡이 어제오늘 안이어니 至今에 피나게 울어 남의 애를 왜 끄는고.

界面二中大葉
林白湖

芳草 욱겨진 골에 시내는 울어 낸다 歌臺舞殿이 어듸어듸메뇨. 夕陽에 물차는 제비야 네가 알가 하노라.

界面二數數葉
李奎報

日暖코 風和한데 鳥聲이 喈喈로다. 滿庭洛花에 閑暇이 누엇스니 아마도 山家今日이 太平인가 하노라.＜85＞
