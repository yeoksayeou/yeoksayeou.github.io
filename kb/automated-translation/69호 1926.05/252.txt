Time truly flies. January, when the white snow lay thick (白雪이 皚皚하던), seems like yesterday, yet already May (五月) has arrived. During that time, what have we truly accomplished, and how much of our core principles have we realized? Having passed more than a third of another year without any particular success to speak of, one cannot suppress the lament of the ancients, the so-called "another day passes without accomplishment (此日又功過)."

Like the saying "Flowers bloom amid much wind and rain (花發多風雨格)," as we face trouble with each issue—confiscation (押收) or deletion (削除)—our hearts feel suppressed, and words do not come easily. We also feel very sorry towards you, our readers. But what can be done? We can only endure and endure until some time [obscured character] (時■지), dedicating ourselves with an indomitable spirit (不屈의 精神) and utmost loyalty (鞠躬盡瘁).
○
That the fundraising association for the expansion of our company (本社의 擴張期成會) is progressing day by day is something for which we cannot but thank all our compatriots [obscured character] under heaven (滿天下同■ 여러분). Our company has specifically dispatched Mr. Pak Tal-sŏng (朴達成君) to the Hwanghae and P'yŏngan western regions (黃平兩西) for this purpose. We have received support and assistance both directly and indirectly in the past, and we earnestly hope (囑望한다) for even more support and assistance this time so that this enterprise (斯嶪) may be successfully established (期成되기를). How could this be considered merely the company's affair?

The serialization of the "Article on the 1894 Donghak Peasant Revolution" (甲午東學亂記事), which was planned for continuation in this issue, has been suspended due to circumstances (事情). It will be published in detail (具體的으로) at a later date when another opportunity arises. We offer our apologies (未安의 말슴) to our readers.

The collection of Master Kim Satkat's (金笠先生) poems, writings, and accounts of his life (詩文及行績募集) has yielded unexpectedly good results (成績이 良好하얏다). As the application deadline (應募期) is approaching (切迫함을 하서), we urge everyone not to miss the time but to submit continuously (連連應募하기를 催告한다).
○
Starting from the next issue, we intend to particularly expand the local news section (地方欄) and record important events occurring in various regions without omission (遺憾업시). Not only those responsible for our company's branch offices (本社의 支分社), but also all readers are encouraged to record and send in as many local events as possible.

**Summary**

This editorial postscript from the May 1926 issue of *Kaebyŏk* reflects on the rapid passage of time and the magazine's perceived lack of significant accomplishment. It laments the constant censorship ("confiscation or deletion") faced with each issue, expressing both frustration and apologies to readers while reaffirming a commitment to persevere. The editors announce the dispatch of Pak Tal-sŏng for fundraising in the Hwanghae and P'yŏngan regions, the suspension of a planned article on the Donghak Revolution, the success of collecting materials on the poet Kim Satkat, and plans to expand local news coverage in future issues, soliciting contributions from readers and branches. For historians, this piece offers a glimpse into the operational struggles of a Korean nationalist magazine under Japanese colonial rule, highlighting the pervasive censorship that directly impacted content (suspension of the Donghak article) and the editors' resilience. The fundraising efforts and the call for local news also indicate attempts to maintain financial viability and reader engagement amidst political pressure.
