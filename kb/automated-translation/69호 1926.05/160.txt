The Recent Red Army
The number of Red Army soldiers currently serving in Russia is 562,000, and reserves number 960,000, making the total deployable force in wartime 1,500,000.

Disposal of the Former Russian Empress's Property
The 20,000 acres of land in the Nizhny Novgorod (늬지늬-노보고로들란드) region formerly owned by the former Russian Empress became the property of the Soviet government after the revolution. This spring, it was publicly distributed to the local farmers, and a villa in the region belonging to a former Duke has been converted for use as an old people's home for farmers.

Russia Becoming a Nation of Women
According to a recent Russian census, the total population of European Russia is 95 million, among which the number of women exceeds the number of men by 5 million. The causes are said to be the effects of the Great European War,<79> the civil war, and the great famine of previous years. Also, the marriage rate is 80 per 10,000 people. What is particularly noteworthy is that the rate of remarriage is higher than the rate of first marriage, and marriages occur more often in autumn and winter than in spring and summer.

Germany's Unemployment Relief
The German Parliament has passed a bill to increase the relief funds provided to the unemployed from the current 40 million Marks to 200 million Marks, and subsidies for various industries and others aimed at relieving these unemployed from 60 million Marks to 100 million Marks. At the same time, it approved the expenditure of 1 million Marks for investigation costs to prevent accidents in mines. Recently, the number of unemployed in Germany is said to reach 2.2 million.

America's Air Force Expansion
Recently, in order to greatly expand its air force, the United States' House Military Affairs Committee passed a major Army aviation expansion bill. Over the next five years, the number of airplanes will be doubled to 2,200 (currently 1,030). Also, a dedicated Assistant Secretary of the Army will be appointed for aviation military administration, and 3 new aviation brigades, 400 aviation officers, and 6,000 aviation soldiers will be added. It is said that if this is implemented, the United States will become the world's sole leading air power nation.

Astonishing Number of Korean Laborers Residing in Japan
The number of Korean laborers who have gone to Japan reaches about 60,000 to 70,000 in the vicinity of Osaka City alone. According to a recent investigation by the Government-General, there are 110,200 males and 23,419 females, totaling 133,710 people. Among these, those residing as established households number 11,030 households, comprising 24,599 males and 11,349 females, totaling 35,948 people. Those not forming a household but residing in the same city, town, or village for three months or more number 54,800 males and 9,100 females, totaling 60,900 people. Others number 30,900 males and 2,800 females, totaling 33,700 people. Is this not astonishing? Does the fact that Korean laborers have increased that much in Japan not signify that Korean peasants have suffered bankruptcy to that extent? <80>

**Summary**

This article presents several international news items from early 1926, covering the Soviet military size, redistribution of Tsarist property, demographic shifts in Russia due to war and famine, German unemployment relief measures, and American plans for air force expansion. The final, most detailed section focuses on the significant number of Korean laborers living in Japan (over 133,000 according to a Government-General survey), broken down by household status. The author expresses astonishment at this number, directly linking the migration of Korean laborers to Japan with the widespread bankruptcy of peasants in colonial Korea. For historians, the final section provides specific (though potentially official) figures on Korean migration to Japan during this period and explicitly voices the contemporary Korean perspective linking this labor migration directly to economic distress and dispossession within Korea under Japanese rule. The detailed breakdown of residency status (households vs. temporary) also offers insight into the nature of this migration.
