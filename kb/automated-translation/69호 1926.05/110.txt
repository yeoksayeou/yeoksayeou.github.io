**Summary**

This news digest from May 1926 covers major events from late March to mid-April 1926, both domestic (Korea) and international. Internationally, it focuses heavily on the chaotic political and military situation in China during the Warlord Era, including cabinet changes, military clashes between factions (National Army, Fengtian Army, Wu Peifu, Li Jinglin), and student protests. Other international news includes developments in the Philippines' independence movement, European politics (Franco-German relations, Italy, Poland, Russia, Greece, Belgium), US military expansion, and unrest in India. Domestically, the article chronicles numerous labor strikes (Inch'ŏn, Masan, Mokp'o, Changsŏng), tenant farmer disputes (Sunch'ŏn, Naju), the activities and suppression of Korean nationalists (Shanghai Provisional Government fund trial, Pak Yŏl case, Tonga Ilbo suspension/resumption, meeting bans) and socialist groups (formation of Chŏnguhoe), social issues like fires, Hyŏngp'yŏngsa clashes, school affairs, and the death of a patriot who refused a Japanese title.

For historians of colonial Korea, this article is valuable for its snapshot of widespread social unrest and burgeoning movements. The frequency of reported strikes, tenant disputes, and the formation of ideological alliances like Chŏnguhoe highlight the growing organization and resistance against colonial conditions and capitalist exploitation. The parallel tracking of the Pak Yŏl case and the Tonga Ilbo censorship reveals the suppression faced by activists and the press. The sheer density of Korean events reported alongside major world news underscores the level of social and political ferment occurring within the colony during this period.
