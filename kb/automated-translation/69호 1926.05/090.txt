The Government-General's Finances Grow Day by Day, A Glance at the Budget for Taishō 15 [1926]

The Underside: Becoming Triple What It Was Before 1919 (己未)

When we hear about the work of the Chōsen Government-General (朝鮮總督府), we intuitively guess what kind of work it might be. However, we shouldn't content ourselves with such vague estimations. We must at least have the intention to examine and be conscious of everything they are doing, numerically and systematically. It is in this sense that we intend to glance at the Chōsen Government-General's budget for this fiscal year, which has been implemented since April 1st. Of course, since we are only discussing the extremely general figures released by the Government-General, it is utterly impossible to fathom what sort of machinations (造化) and schemes (陰謀) they are employing behind these numbers. Nevertheless, thinking it is better than not writing anything, we present this summary first.

According to the announcement by the Government-General authorities, this year's budget, following last year's consolidation and austerity, was supposedly compiled under a continued austerity policy. However, projects like increasing rice production (産米增殖) and flood prevention (水害防止) absolutely could not be delayed, so the necessary expenses were reportedly allocated for each, as far as financial resources permitted. The total budget amount for this fiscal year, claimed to have been made while championing austerity, austerity, is 188,006,094 yen each for revenue and expenditure. This is an increase of 11,958,113 yen compared to last year, and a massive increase of 124,504,590 yen compared to the budget of Taishō 7 (1918) before the March First Movement (己未), amounting to nearly triple the sum. The fact that the Government-General's budget amount is increasing almost exponentially year by year allows us to intuitively grasp that, broadly speaking, the Chōsen Government-General's policy towards Chōsen since the March First Movement has become that much more aggressive. Furthermore, seeing that the bulk of the budget amount is heavily weighted towards industry, transportation, and security, one can infer how the Government-General's policy focuses on economically managing (經略) Chōsen, and also how they are busily working on completing transportation infrastructure and establishing security networks <51> as foundational facilities for such management.

Considering this budget of over 180 million yen [Note: the text incorrectly states 1.8 billion here, but earlier context indicates 188 million] in more detail, first, in revenue (歲入), the ordinary section (經常部) accounts for 149,453,538 yen, and the extraordinary section (臨時部) for 38,552,555 yen. Among these, tax revenues (租稅收入)—including land tax, income tax, exchange tax, mining tax, liquor tax, tobacco cultivation tax, sugar consumption tax, customs duties, tonnage tax, departure tax, Bank of Chōsen note issue tax, etc.—amount to over 37,486,000 yen; stamp revenues (印紙收入) are over 10 million yen; revenues from government enterprises and properties (官業 及 官有財産) (including monopolies on tobacco, red ginseng, salt, and income from railways, forestry, postal/telegraph services, weights and measures, post station land rentals (驛屯賭), government property leases, prison income, etc.) are over 99,800,000 yen; and miscellaneous income (雜收入) from fines, hospitals, sales of government property, etc., is over 2.1 million yen. The main revenues in the extraordinary section include proceeds from the sale of government property (官有物拂下) like land, buildings, and ships, amounting to over 3.9 million yen; supplementary funds (補充金) from the Japanese central government are over 15 million yen; and government bond funds (公債金) are over 15 million yen. Turning next to expenditures (歲出), that is, how the money is spent: first, in the ordinary section, major items include personnel expenses (人件費) for the Government-General, courts, prisons, provincial offices, etc., totaling over 40 million yen; the Yi Royal Household (李王家) expenses of 1.8 million yen; the Monopoly Bureau (專賣局) expenses of over 17.3 million yen; railway operating expenses (鐵道作業費) of over 41.8 million yen; communications expenses (遞信費) of over 11.3 million yen; and transfers (繰入) to the Government Bond Consolidation Fund special account of over 15.1 million yen. Next comes what could truly be called the

Application Aspect of Government-General Rule (總督政治)

—the extraordinary section expenditures, from which all machinations and means are said to derive. Looking at this, subsidies (補助) for private railways, the iron industry, other industries, education, etc., amount to over 13.8 million yen; railway construction and improvement costs (鐵道建設 及 改良費) are over 15 million yen; public works costs (土木費) related to the construction of roads, harbors, and rivers are over 6.8 million yen; building and repair costs (營繕費) required for Government-General deposits [likely refers to construction costs related to finance/deposits or possibly just buildings] and the new construction of the Kyŏngsŏng courthouse amount to over 3.3 million yen; investigation and testing costs (調査 及 試驗費) are over 460,000 yen; arable land improvement and expansion costs (耕地改良 及 擴張費) are over 5 million yen; and adding various other tangible and intangible items, the total expenditure for the extraordinary section alone amounts to over 47.6 million yen.

To Speak Generally (統而言之)

In today's situation where the relationship between Chōsen and Japan is as it is, if the money spent by the hands of the Government-General amounts to 200 million yen [referring to the rounded total budget] a year, it can only be seen as correspondingly fostering Japanese people or Japanese-aligned forces (日本人的 勢力). If one looks <52> a step further into this, one will discover any number of instances where the interests (利權) of Japanese people are being directly fostered and expanded. For example, expenditures required for the rice production increase plan (産米增殖計劃), expenses needed for all other aspects of industrial promotion (勸業方面), expenses for forestry and river management (治山治水), and even expenses required for the construction and improvement of roads and harbors—almost all fall into this category. This is evident above all when looking at the new increases in this year's budget compared to last year. That is, this year's budget amount increased by 11,958,113 yen compared to last year; among this, the natural increase (當然 增加) is 4,279,356 yen, and the new increase (新規增加) is 7,678,757 yen. This so-called new increase mainly consists of expenses required for rice production increase (subsidies for irrigation and land reclamation projects), forestry and river management, and the construction of roads and harbors. As mentioned above, all these things serve to foster the interests of those people [the Japanese]. If we say this, the authorities will likely rebut,

"Then what are you suggesting we do? Aren't these precisely the facilities that those governing Chōsen (朝鮮爲政者) naturally ought to provide?"

Indeed, that is true. They are truly necessary and natural facilities that must be provided. Since these naturally necessary facilities are being provided, what can be done about the fact that the benefits naturally accrue to the Japanese side, which has money and power, and thus the interests of Chōsen naturally fall into their possession? Even the Government-General authorities would probably admit this much is fact. What is all this? It is what the world always calls the problem of the system (制度問題) and the problem of political power (政權問題). Under this system and this political power, things inevitably turn out this way. Can those who claim that if one just strives earnestly and puts things into practice under any system or any ruler, things will work out, not come forward and gaze intently (凝視) at this reality?

Among These, the Most Deceptive are the Subsidies! (補助費)

Among the Chōsen Government-General's budget items, the one allowing the most flexible utilization (活用自在) is the so-called subsidy (補助費). This subsidy policy, based on these funds, possesses an elusive and unpredictable (神出鬼沒) nature of machination. Looking at this year's budget, the portion for pre-existing plans continuing from before is 17,095,751 yen, and the portion for newly planned initiatives starting this year is 2,081,675 yen, totaling 19,177,426 yen. Anyone can generally imagine what sort of strange and unusual situations (變狀奇狀) might arise under the sway of these nearly 20 million yen in gold and silver [metaphor for money]. To briefly mention just a few prominent examples of these subsidies: subsidies for construction costs to operators of water utilization, irrigation, and land reclamation projects amount to 4,307,000 yen; subsidies for private railways (私設鐵道) to the Chōsen Railway Company (朝鮮鐵道會社) and <53> three other companies amount to 4.3 million yen; education cost subsidies (敎育費補助) amount to over 3.71 million yen; subsidies for promoting iron manufacturing (製鐵獎勵補助) to the Mitsubishi Iron Manufacturing Company (三菱製鐵會社) amount to 180,000 yen; and subsidies to the Chōsen Textile Corporation (朝鮮紡織株式會社) amount to 20,000 yen (with 28,000 yen subsidized to the Kyŏngsŏng Textile Corporation (京城紡織株式會社)). Just looking at these examples reveals the nature and outline of the subsidies.

What About Provincial, Municipal, and Township Expenses? (地方費와 府費 及 面費는 如何)

Above, we have glanced at the Chōsen Government-General's budget for this fiscal year. Besides this, we must separately examine the budgets for provincial expenses (地方費) covering each province, municipal expenses (府費) covering each municipality, and township expenses (面費) covering each township, which have distinct revenues and expenditures—in other words, the budgets of these minor Government-Generals. The figures for Taishō 15 (this year) are not yet known, but looking at those for Taishō 14 (1925), the combined revenue and expenditure for the 13 provinces was 22,567,529 yen each. This too is a more than 3.5-fold (35割强) increase compared to the 6,606,728 yen in Taishō 7 (1918). The municipal expenses (府費) for Taishō 14, across all 12 municipalities in Chōsen, were 8,102,518 yen each for revenue and expenditure, which is more than a four-fold increase compared to the 1,945,886 yen in Taishō 7. Following that, the township expenses (面費) for Taishō 14 were 17,881,663 yen each for revenue and expenditure; this too is more than a four-fold increase compared to the 4,462,949 yen in Taishō 7.
In short (要컨대), the expenditures of the governing authorities in Chōsen, both central and local, are dramatically increasing by leaps and bounds. Simultaneously, the corresponding presence of Japanese people and Japanese-aligned forces (日本人 及 日本人的 勢力) expands, and the burden (負擔) on the general populace increases daily (日增).

**Summary**

This 1926 article from *Kaebyŏk* magazine critiques the sharply increasing budget of the Japanese Government-General of Korea. The author notes the budget has nearly tripled since 1918, reaching over 188 million yen. Despite official claims of austerity, significant funds are allocated to areas like industry, transportation, security, rice production, and public works. The author argues that these expenditures, particularly new increases and subsidies (totaling nearly 20 million yen), primarily serve to entrench Japanese control, expand Japanese economic interests (利權), and foster Japanese power in Korea, rather than benefiting the Korean people. The article also points out the dramatic rise in local administrative budgets (provincial, municipal, township), implying an increasing financial burden on Koreans. It concludes by framing this as an inherent problem of the colonial system (制度問題) and political power structure (政權問題), suggesting that true progress for Koreans is impossible under Japanese rule. Historians would find this article valuable as a contemporary Korean perspective voicing dissent against colonial economic policies, highlighting the perceived exploitation masked as development, the mechanisms of control (like subsidies), and the link made between budget allocation and the consolidation of Japanese power. The detailed budget breakdown offers insights into colonial priorities.

나날이 커가는 總督府의 살님살이, 大正 15年度의 豫算面을 一瞥하고
己未 以前의 三倍가 되는 裏面
朝鮮總督府의 하는 일이라 하면 우리는 直覺的으로 그 일이 엇더한 일일 것을 짐작한다. 그러나 이와 가른 漠然한 짐작으로서 만은 안 될 것이다. 적어도 그들의 하여가는 一切를 數字的으로 體系的으로 考察意識하려는 心算을 가지지 아느면 안 될 것이다. 우리는 이런 意味에서 지난 4月 1日부터 實行되고 잇는 今年度 朝鮮總督府의 豫算을 一瞥하려 한다. 勿論 이것은 總督府에서 發表한 極히 大體에 涉한 數字만을 가지고 말하게 됨으로, 이 數字의 裏面에서 그들이 如何한 造化 陰謀를 부리고 잇는가는 到底히 窺知할 수가 업는 것이나 그래도 아니 쓰는 것보다는 날가해서 爲先 이러케 摘示하는 것이다.
總督府 當局의 發表에 依하면 今年度의 豫算은 前年度의 整理緊縮의 後를 承하야 依然 緊縮方針 밋헤서 編成하려는 것이나 産米增殖水害防止와 가튼 事業은 到底히 延拖할 수가 업서서 財源의 許하는 限에서는 各各 所要經費를 計上하엿다고 한다. 이러케 緊縮緊縮을 標榜하면서 하엿다는 今年度豫算總額은 歲入歲出 各 1億 88,006,094圓으로서 昨年度보다 1,195萬8,113圓을 增加하엿고 己未 以前의 大正 7年度 豫算보다는 1億2,450萬4,590圓 卽 近三倍의 巨額을 增計하엿다. 이와가티 總督府의 豫算額이 거의 飛躍的으로 逐年增加한다는 것은 大體로 보아 己未 以後 朝鮮總督府의 朝鮮에 대한 政策이 그만큼 積極的인 것을 直覺할 수가 잇스며 더욱 그 豫算額의 大部가 産業, 交通, 警備의 方面에 偏傾함을 볼 때에 總督府의 政策이 如何히 朝鮮을 經濟的으로 經略하기에 注力하는 것과 또는 그러한 經營의 基礎施設을 하기 爲하야＜51＞ 交通機關의 完成, 警備網의 施設에 奔走하고 잇는 것을 짐작 할 수가 잇는 것이다.

이 18億圓餘의 豫算額에 대하야 좀 더 詳考하면 爲先 歲入에는 經常部로 1億4,945萬3,538圓이오 臨時部로 3,855萬2,555圓인데 그 中에는 地稅, 所得稅, 取引所稅 鑛業稅, 酒稅, 煙草耕作稅, 砂糖消費稅, 關稅, 噸稅, 出港稅, 朝鮮銀行券發行稅 等 租稅收入이 3,748萬6千餘圓, 印紙收入이 1千萬餘圓 官業 及 官有財産(煙草, 紅蔘, 鹽業의 專賣와 鐵道, 森林 郵電, 度量衡, 驛屯賭, 官有物貸下, 刑務所收入 等) 收入이 9,980餘萬圓, 其他의 罰金, 病院, 官有物拂下 等으로 생기는 雜收入이 210餘萬圓이오, 臨時部의 主要收入으로는 土地, 建物, 船舶 等의 官有物을 拂下할 代가 390餘萬圓, 日本中央政府로 가져오는 補充金이 1,500餘萬圓 公債金이 1,500餘萬圓이며 다시 歲出便, 卽 돈쓰는 모양을 보면 첫재 經常部로 總督府, 裁判所, 刑務所, 地方廳等의 人件費 4.000餘萬圓 李王家歲費 180萬圓 專賣局 1,730餘萬圓 鐵道作業費 4,180餘萬圓, 遞信費가 1,130餘萬圓, 國債整理基金 特別會計繰入 1,510餘萬圓이 其 主要한 것이며 그 다음으로 正말

總督政治의 應用方面
이라할만한 同時에 모든 造化와 手段이 일로부터 나온다고 할 만한 臨時部의 歲出을 보면 私設鐵道, 製鐵業, 其他 産業, 敎育 等의 方面에 補助하는 것이 1,380餘萬圓, 鐵道建設 及 改良費가 1,500餘萬圓, 道路港灣, 河川 等의 修築에 係한 土木費가 680餘萬圓, 總督府入金, 京城裁判所의 新建築類에 要하는 營繕費가 330餘萬圓, 調査 及 試驗費가 46萬餘圓, 耕地改良 及 擴張費가 500餘萬圓, 其他의 有象無象을 合하야 臨時部支出總額만이 4,760餘萬圓을 算하게 되엿다.

統而言之하면
朝鮮과 日本과의 關係가 現今과 가티 된 오늘에 잇서는 總督府의 손으로 쓰는 돈이 一年에 2億萬圓이라 하면 2億萬圓에 相當한 그만큼 日本人 또는 日本人的 勢力을 扶植하는 것이라고 밧게 볼 수 업는 것이오 여긔에서 한＜52＞ 거름을 더 드러가 보면. 거희 正面으로 日本人의 利權을 扶植擴張하는 것이 얼마라도 잇슴을 發見할지니 例하면 産米增殖計劃에 要하는 支出, 其他 一切의 勸業方面에 要하는 經費, 治山治水 乃至 道路 及 港灣의 修築改良에 要하는 經費의 一切가 거의 그런 類이라 할 것이다. 이것은 무엇보다도 今年度 豫算에 대한 新規增加를 보아 그러하니 즉, 今年度豫算額은 昨年度 보다도 1,195萬8,113圓이 增加된 中, 그 中의 當然 增加가 427萬9,356圓이오 新規增加가 767萬8,757圓인데 이 新規增加라 하는 것은 主로 産米增殖(灌漑 及 開墾事業補助)과 治山治水와 道路 及 港灣의 修築에 要하는 經費인 바 右에 말한바와 가티 이런 것이 모다 저사람들의 利權을 扶植하게 되는 것이다. 우리가 이러케 말하면 當局者로서는
「그러면 엇더케 하란 말이냐. 그것이 모다 朝鮮爲政者로서의 當然히 할 施設이 아니냐.」
하고 反駁할 것이다. 果然 그러타, 眞實로 아니하지 못할 當然한 施設이다. 이와가티 當然히 할 施設을 하는데 그 利益은 스스로 돈 잇고 權力잇는 日本人側으로 도라가며 그리하야 朝鮮의 利權은 스스로 그들의 占有에 도라가는 것을 엇지 한단 말이냐. 總督府 當局者로 볼때에도 아마 이것만은 事實이라고 自認하리라. 이것이 모다 무에냐하면 世上에서 恒常 말하는 制度問題이며 政權問題이다. 이 制度와 이 政權의 밋헤서는 스스로 必然的으로 그리되는 것이다. 아모러 한 制度나 아모러 한 支配者의 밋헤서 스스로 實상만 힘쓰고 力行만 한다면 될 수 잇다는 사람아 나와서 이 現實을 凝視할 수는 업슬가.

中에도 造化만흔 補助費!
朝鮮總督府 豫算中에서도 가장 活用이 自在한 것은 所謂 補助費라 하는 것이니 이 補助費에 依한 補助政策이야말로 神出鬼沒의 造化性을 가진 것이다. 今年度豫算을 보면 從前부터 하여 오는 旣定計劃의 分이 1,709萬5,751圓이오 今年으로부터 새로 計劃한 分이 208萬1,675圓 合計 1,917萬7,426圓이다. 이 2千萬圓의 黃白을 휘두르는 그 밋헤 如何한 變狀奇狀이 생길가 하는 것은 누구나 그 大體를 생각할 수 잇는 바이거니와 이제 暫間 그 補助의 著例만을 든다하면 水利灌漑 及 開墾事業經營者에 대한 工事費의 補助가 430萬7千圓, 朝鮮鐵道會社外＜53＞ 三會社에 대한 私設鐵道補助가 430萬圓, 敎育費補助가 371萬餘圓, 三菱製鐵會社에 대한 製鐵獎勵補助가 18萬圓, 朝鮮紡織株式會社에 대한 補助가 2萬圓(京城紡織株式會에 2萬8千圓補助) 者인 바 이로써만 보아도 그 補助의 性質 及 輪廓을 알 수가 잇다.

地方費와 府費 及 面費는 如何
右에는 朝鮮總督府의 今年度豫算面을 一瞥하엿거니와 이밧게 特히 收支를 달니하는 各道를 通한 地方費와 各府를 通한 府費와 各面을 通한 面費의 豫算- 달니 말하면 이 小總督府들의 豫算을 別見하지 아늘수 업스니 大正 15年度 卽 今年度의 것은 아즉 알 수 업고 大正 14年度의 것으로써 보면 13道의 것을 統合한 歲入歲出이 各2,256萬7,529圓인바 이 亦 大正 7年度의 660萬6,728圓에 比하면 35割强이 느럿고, 大正14年度의 府費는 全鮮12府를 通하야 歲入歲出이 各810萬2,518圓인 바 大正 7年度의 194萬5,886圓에 比하면 四倍以上의 增加이오 그다음으로 面費는 大正14年度의 歲入出이 各1,788萬1,663圓인 바 이亦 大正7年의 446萬2,949圓에 比하면 4倍 以上 增加이다.
要컨대 朝鮮爲政當局의 用途는 中央地方을 할 것 업시 飛躍的으로 激增하는 同時에 이에 따른 日本人 及 日本人的 勢力은 擴張되고 一般人民의 負擔은 日增하는 것이다. 一記者＜54＞
