For the Business World
						Sŏk Chin-hyŏng (石鎭衡)

When we speak of the "business world" (實業界), its meaning seems so vast (廣闊) that one might not know which aspect is being referred to. However, "business" or "industry" (實業) ultimately means carrying out the activities necessary for our three basic needs: clothing, food, and shelter (衣食住). Therefore, agriculture, industry, commerce, and all other activities necessary for life can be called "business." While it is undoubtedly true that both agriculture <18> and commerce are necessary for life, among these, I believe that whether or not one engages successfully in industry (工業) serves as the dividing line, the watershed, that distinguishes civilization from barbarism (文野). Observing our business world in recent times (輓近), in agriculture, it has been called the great foundation of the world, and since the vast majority of people have engaged in it and entrusted their clothing, food, and shelter to it, it has somehow formed a certain pattern up to the present day. However, in commerce and industry, there is hardly anything worth seeing (可觀). Since ancient times, those engaged in commerce have received very low-level treatment in the social hierarchy, and somewhat influential people have thought it shameful to engage in it. Therefore, even within the capital city (京城), those engaged in commerce formed a distinct class, separate in marriage and social interaction, unrelated to others. Consequently, its development languished (萎靡不振). Since recent times, however, the scope of commerce (通商) has broadened, and the exchange of goods faces no hindrance (碍滯) from national borders. Following the dictates of the general trend, some merchants in Chosŏn (朝鮮), realizing the signs of the times, wish to advance alongside this trend, but their knowledge, means, and methods are lacking, placing them far behind. However, even this is proceeding somehow, albeit imperfectly, and it goes without saying that there are many points needing improvement.

While agriculture and commerce, as briefly mentioned above, have formed some shape and continue to exist and proceed, albeit imperfectly, industry alone has reached a state where the few traces of businesses that existed since ancient times have all fallen into ruin (頹敗), and new industries cannot burgeon (勃興), presenting what can be called a state of no industry. Look! How many significant industries exist within Chosŏn, and where?

Generally, why is it that we humans differ from other animals, exclude other animals, kill and eat other animals, enjoy comfort in plains, wide fields, tall buildings, and great pavilions, and there is nothing humans desire that they cannot do unto other animals? Is it because human intelligence is superior to that of other animals? Is it because human strength surpasses that of other animals? Upon careful reflection and deep thought, one might say this is not necessarily so. Many animals possess intelligence, strength, and well-developed offensive and defensive capabilities that humans cannot match. Why then does the aforementioned phenomenon manifest? I secretly surmise (窃相) that this is because the innate abilities (良能) bestowed by heaven (天賦) upon each entity differ. What are these heaven-bestowed innate abilities? Birds are endowed with the power of flight, fish with the power of swimming, and beasts with the power of running. If each competed individually against humans, humans might not find a point of certain victory. Yet, what special strength do humans possess that allows them to exclude other animals as described and enjoy blissful comfort? This too is nothing but the manifestation of a heaven-bestowed innate ability. What heaven-bestowed innate ability do humans possess? It is none other than this: humans are endowed with the innate ability to use fire (用火力). Think! The innate ability to utilize fire is not granted to any animal other than humans. How great is the power of using fire! How magnificent <19> is the power of using fire! This is truly the driving force by which human animals exclude other animals, and the foundation upon which they enjoy supreme comfort. What the distant future holds is unknown, but up to the present day, no force greater than fire exists, and the ability to utilize it is limited to humans.

Since great antiquity, in whatever ancient era, humans knew how to use fire. For example, when making a boat, they placed fire upon a large log, burned it, dug out the ashes, and floated the wood on water to travel back and forth. Especially in eras without machinery (機械), there was no other method to cut a single log. Try to imagine. Without using axes or saws, how could we possibly cut it? There is surely no way. However, even humans of ancient times, in an era without machinery, could cut large logs using fire. Which animal other than humans possesses this ability? The power of this innate ability led to the utilization of iron to create machinery, make guns and cannons (銃砲), build steamships (輪船), construct railroads (鐵道), and forge swords and halberds (劒戟). With these, they control things of great strength, shoot down fliers and runners to eliminate or defend against them, and humans themselves enjoy the comfort they desire. In general, while there are countless things that supply the three elements of our life—clothing, food, and shelter—if one considers each one, it is impossible to accomplish even one without utilizing fire.

As generally discussed above, the power of using fire is a heaven-bestowed gift limited to humans, and through it, they exclude other animals and enjoy supreme comfort. This principle is a phenomenon of innate endowment existing between humans and other animals, but it manifests not only between these two but also among humans themselves. Humans who can skillfully utilize this firepower exclude other humans and seize hegemony, while humans who use it incompletely cannot avoid inferiority and become subject to the control of others in various aspects. Especially when it comes to industry, this is entirely the highest culmination of firepower usage. Therefore, among barbarous humans whose use of fire is incomplete, we have never heard of the promotion of industry using machinery based on firepower. Hence, humans who engage in industry using fire are limited to civilized humans, and those unable to do so are barbarous humans. Shall we fail to use the innate ability bestowed upon us by heaven, return it, and resign ourselves to being barbarous humans? Or should we strive further upward, benefiting both others and ourselves, to engage in a proper life?

Among those engaged in business recently—though this is not true for everyone—it seems observable that the concept of high-interest lending (高利貸金) dominates the minds of the vast majority. Many people are ignorant of other types of business and hold the notion that interest begets interest, where one penny becomes two, two become three, doubling in a year and leading to wealth in two or three years. This concept governs all sorts of affairs. When two people join to start a business, <20> they establish a high-interest lending club (高利貸金稧). If one obtains capital to manage a business, they open a pawnshop (典當鋪) or loan office (質屋). Progressing and growing step by step, when forming a large organization to conduct business, they manage a high-interest loan company or a bank of the same type. This describes the reality of today's business world. These common practices are all manifestations of the high-interest lending mentality. But I have never heard of a country or region where high-interest lending is rampant (跋扈) and its actual industry has developed. Why don't we abandon this and invest in industry, which fundamentally increases wealth?

Lending businesses are not unnecessary depending on the circumstances, but if this business becomes excessive, the economy declines. Why? Generally, we consider the finance industry (金融業) to be the same as the shipping industry (船舶業). What is the shipping industry? Ships float on water, load cargo from this shore, reach the other shore, planning the transport of goods between here and there, and ferry passengers loaded from this shore to the other shore, facilitating human transportation. It is an institution. It is not fundamentally a business that increases the volume of water that floats the ship. What is it then? If defined, the shipping industry can be called a business that floats ships on water and facilitates the transportation of goods and people. Then what is the finance industry? Defined similarly, the finance industry is none other than this: floating widely in the society of wealth, it receives money from people on this side as deposits (預金), lends it out as loans (貸金) to people on that side, receives money from people here as remittances (爲替), and sends it to people there, planning the circulation (流通) of finance. Therefore, the finance industry is not a business that fundamentally increases wealth; it is an institution that plans for smooth circulation (融通) by moving existing wealth from here to there. When money comes and goes like this, if it is not invested productively and instead circulates through high-interest lending, the economy will dry up (枯渴) and perish. In the time it takes for one hundred won from my pocket to move to another's pocket, one cannot help but tilt at least a cup of cheap wine, or buy at least a pair of straw sandals. Comparing this to water, it is like the water in a pond evaporating on one side due to the sun's power. Without a source (源泉), how many days could it possibly sustain itself? Therefore, fundamentally increasing this wealth and making this water volume spring forth from its source is limited to promoting industry by utilizing the greatest force, the power of fire. <21>

**Summary**

Sŏk Chin-hyŏng argues that Korea's (Chosŏn's) economic backwardness stems from its underdeveloped industrial sector, contrasting it with agriculture and commerce, the latter historically looked down upon. He posits that the ability to utilize "fire"—representing technology and industry—is the key differentiator between "civilized" and "barbarous" peoples, and the source of human dominance. He laments that Koreans have failed to develop this innate human capacity for industry, instead focusing excessively on commerce and, particularly, high-interest lending (usury). He compares finance to shipping—merely circulating existing resources, not creating new wealth—and warns that an economy dominated by usury without a productive industrial base (the "source") will inevitably dry up and collapse. He strongly advocates for abandoning the pursuit of quick profits through lending and instead investing capital in foundational industries.

From a historical perspective, this article is significant as it reflects the anxieties and aspirations of Korean intellectuals during the colonial period regarding modernization and economic development. It highlights the perceived weakness of indigenous Korean capitalism, particularly the lack of industrial development compared to Japan, and critiques traditional social attitudes towards commerce alongside contemporary tendencies towards speculative finance (usury) rather than productive investment. The framing of industrial capacity (use of "fire") as the marker of civilization versus barbarism reveals the influence of social Darwinist thought and the urgent desire to achieve parity with perceived 'advanced' nations through industrialization. The critique of high-interest lending points to specific economic practices seen as detrimental to national economic health.

實業界를 爲하야
						石鎭衡
實業界라 하면 그 意義가 廣闊하야 何 方面을 指稱함인지 不知할 듯한데 實業이라 하면 畢竟은 吾人 衣食住 三者에 必要한 業을 實行하는 것임으로 農工上 其他 萬般 生活上에 必要한 業은 皆 實業이라 함을 得할지로다. 農業이던지＜18＞ 商業이던지 다 生活에 必要한 業이 됨은 無疑한 事實이로되 就中工業에 至하야는 此를 營得하고 營得치 못함이 文野의 岐路를 辦하는 分水線이 됨을 得할가 하노라. 輓近 以來에 我 實業界를 觀察하건대 農業에 在하야는 天下의 大本이라 하야 大多數人이 此를 營하고 大多數人이 此에 衣食住를 託하야 來하얏는 故로 如何間 一樣式을 成하야 今日에 至하얏거니와 商工業에 在하야는 자못 可觀할 點이 無하도다. 自古로 商業을 營하는 人은 社會的 階級에 在하야 甚히 下級的 待遇를 受하야 若干 有力한 人은 皆此를 營함을 恥辱으로 思하는 故로 京城 以內에 在하야도 商을 營하는 人은 別로 一階級을 成하야 婚姻交通이 與他不關하야 그 發達이 萎靡不振하더니 輓近 以後에 그 通商의 範圍가 獷大하고 物質의 交易이 國境의 碍滯가 無함으로 大勢의 逐하는 바에 依하야 朝鮮의 商人도 若干은 時勢를 覺悟하야 此와 並進코저 하나 그 知識과 手段方法의 未及한 點이 有하야 此에 遠함이 甚하도다. 然하나 此亦 不完全한 대로 如何間 進行하되 此를 改良할 點이 多함은 多言을 不要할 바이로다.
右 略言함과 如한 農商業은 不完全한 대로 그 形跡을 成하야 存在하고 進行하되 唯獨 工業에 至하야는 多少 古來로 形跡이 有하던 業이 擧皆頹敗에 歸하고 新工業은 勃興함을 不得하야 可謂 無工業 狀態를 呈하얏도다. 觀하라. 朝鮮 內에 相當한 工業이 幾處幾處에 存在한가.
大抵 吾人 人類가 他動物과 相異하고 又는 他動物을 排除하고 他動物을 殺食하고 平原廣野와 高樓巨閣에서 安樂을 享有하고 人類의 所欲을 他動物에 對하야 行得치 못함이 無함은 何故인고. 人類의 智가 他動物보다 優越하야 然함인가. 人類의 力이 他動物보다 卓越하야 然함인가. 細思熟考하면 반듯이 然한 것도 아니라 하겟다. 各各 그 智의 長함과 力의 大함과 進取防禦力의 周到함이 人類의 及하지 못할 者ㅣ 甚多하되 右와 如한 現像을 露出함은 何故인고. 窃相컨대 此는 다 그 各體에 對하야 天賦된 良能이 相殊한 故인가 하노라. 그 天賦된 良能이라 함은 何오. 鳥類에 在하야는 飛力이 天賦되고 魚類에 在하야는 泳力이 天賦되고 獸類에 在하야 走力이 天賦되엇다. 各各 一個一個로 人類와 競爭하는 時는 人類가 必勝의 點을 發見키 不能할 지로다. 然한데 人類는 何點의 特長이 有하야 如右한 他動物을 排除하고 幸福한 安樂을 享하는가. 此亦 天賦된 良能의 發揮에 不外하는도다. 人類에는 何의 天賦良能이 有한가 非他라. 人類에게는 用火力의 良能이 天賦되엇도다. 思하라. 火를 利用하는 良能은 人類 外의 他動物에게는 賦與되지 아니하얏나니 大哉라. 用火力이어 偉哉라. 用火의 力이어.＜19＞ 此는 實로 人類動物이 他動物을 排除하는 原動力이요, 無上한 安樂을 享有하는 根本이로다. 遠한 將來에 在하야는 未知하거니와 今日에 至하기까지는 力의 大한 者ㅣ 火에 過한 者ㅣ 無한데 此를 利用하는 能力이 天賦된 者는 人類에 限하얏도다.
人類는 大昔 如何한 上古時代라도 火를 使用함을 知하니 假令 舟를 作함에 火를 大木上에 置하고 此를 燒하야 其灰를 掘하고 其木을 水上에 泛하야 往來함을 得하며 特別히 機械를 使用치 못한 時代에 在하야는 一木을 斷하기에 그 方法이 無하나니 試思하라. 吾等이 斧鉅를 使用치 아니하고 如何히 此를 切致함을 可得할가. 決코 道理가 無할지로다. 然이나 上古時代의 人類라도 機械가 無한 時代에 在하야는 火를 使用하야 能히 大木을 切斷하나니 人類를 除한 他動物 何者에 此 能力이 有한가. 此 良能의 力이 鐵을 利用하야 機械를 作하며 銃砲를 作하며 輪船을 作하며 鐵道를 作하며 劒戟을 作하야 此로써 力의 大한 것을 制하고 飛者 走者를 射하야 此를 除禦하고 人間自身은 所欲의 安樂을 享有하는도다. 大凡 吾人 生活의 要素를 作하는 衣食住 三者에 供하는 것이 無論 大多種이거니와 一一히 此를 考하면 何者됨을 不拘하고 火를 利用치 못하고는 其一을 成하기 不能할지로다.
以上에 槩論함과 如히 用火의 力은 人類에 限하야 天賦된 것인데 此로써 他動物을 排除하고 無上한 安樂을 享하는 바인데 此 理致는 人間과 他動物과의 間에 存在한 天賦의 現象이거니와 此 兩者 間에뿐 아니라 人間 自己 互相 間에도 發現되나니 此 火力을 能히 利用하는 人類는 他人類를 排除하고 覇權을 掌握하며 此를 不完全하게 使用하는 人類는 劣等됨을 未免하야 各 方面으로 他의 支配를 受하게 되는데 特히 工業에 至하야는 此는 專히 火力 使用의 最極點인 故로 火의 使用이 不完全한 野蠻人類에 在하야는 火力에 依한 機械를 使用하야 工業의 振興이 有함을 未聞하얏노라. 故로 火를 使用하야 工業을 營하는 人類는 文明人類에 限하고 此를 營키 不能함은 野蠻的 人類인데 吾人은 天賦하신 良能을 使用치 못하고 此를 返上하야 野蠻人類에 自處할가 又는 더욱더욱 向上하야 人도 益하고 我도 益하야 相當한 生活을 營함이 可할가 否할가.
近來에 實業을 營하는 人中에는 皆然이라 함은 아니로되 大多數가 高利貸金이라 하는 觀念이 其腦를 支配하는 樣으로 認함을 得할 點이 不無하도다. 多數人의 他種 實業은 不知하고 또 利生生利하야 一分이 二分되고 二分이 三分되어 一年이면 倍增하고 二三年이면 成富라 하는 觀念이 各種 事物을 管理하야 二人이 合하야 實業을 營한다 하면＜20＞ 高利貸金稧를 創立하고 或 資本을 得하야 業을 經營한다 하면 典當鋪와 質屋을 開하고 次次 發達 長成하야 宏大한 團體로 實業을 營한다 하면 高利貸金會社 又는 此와 同種類 銀行을 經營함이 今日의 實業界 現象을 事實로 語하는 바니라. 此 普通과 皆 高利貸金 觀念의 發作이나 未知하거니와 高利貸金이 跋扈하고 其國과 그 地方에 實業이 發達하얏다 함은 未聞하얏노라. 如何코 吾人는 此를 捨하고 根本的으로 財貨를 增進하는 工業에 投資함이.
貸金業이 境遇에 依하야는 必要치 아니함이 아니로되 此 業이 過度하면 그 經濟界는 衰退하나니 何故오하면 大抵 金融業이라 함은 吾人은 此를 船舶業과 同樣이라 하노라. 船舶業이라 함은 何也오. 船舶은 水上에 浮하야 此邊 陸上으로부터 貨物을 積載하고 彼陸에 到達하야 此邊 彼邊의 貨物의 交通을 計圖하며 此 陸邊으로는 商客을 滿載하고 彼 陸邊에 越渡하야 人의 交通을 便宜케 하는 一機關이요. 根本的으로 그 船舶을 浮上케 하는 水量을 增進케 하는 業은 아니라. 然則 何오. 此를 定義하면 船舶業은 船舶을 水上에 浮케 하고 貨物의 運搬과 人類의 交通을 便宜케 하는 業이라 함을 可得할지로다. 然則 金融業은 何오. 右와 同樣으로 定義하면 金融業은 非他라. 財貨的 社會에 泛泛하야 此 邊人의 手로부터 預金이라 하야 金錢을 受取하야는 此를 彼 邊人에게 對하야 貸金으로 貸出하며 又 此 處人으로부터 爲替라 하야 受金하야는 此를 彼 處人에게 送金하야 그 金融의 流通을 計圖하는 業이라. 然則 金融業은 그 根本的 財貨를 增加하는 業이 아니요, 그 所在한 財貨를 此處彼處로 融通하야 圓滑함을 計圖하는 機關이라. 金錢이 如此히 往來하고 出納되는 其間에 此를 生産的으로 放資되지 아니하고 또 高利貸金的으로 往來하는 時는 經濟界가 枯渴하야 亡하고 已할 뿐이라 余의 囊中의 金 百圓이 他人의 囊中에 移去하는 其間에 薄酒 一盃라도 傾치 아니함을 不得할지요. 又 草鞋 一個라도 買치 아니함을 不得할지로다. 此를 水에 比較하면 池上의 水가 一邊으로 太陽의 力에 依하야 蒸發됨과 如하니 源泉이 無하고야 其能 幾日을 維支함을 可得하리요. 然故로 此 財貨를 根本的으로 增進하고 此 水量을 源泉的으로 湧出케 함은 最大 力되는 火의 力을 利用하야 工業을 增進함에 限한다 하노라. ＜21＞
