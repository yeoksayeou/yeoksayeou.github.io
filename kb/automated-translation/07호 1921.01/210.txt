The Three Joys of Master Yuktang

Long ago, Maengja stated the Three Joys as: looking up, to have no occasion for shame before Heaven, and looking down, to have no occasion to blush before men (仰不愧於天俯不怍於人); that parents, brothers, wife, and children are all well (父母兄弟妻子無故); and to get the talented youth of the kingdom and educate them (得天下英才而敎育之). However, Master Ch'oe Yuktang Sŏnsaeng on some occasion spoke of the Three Joys as follows.

If one's spirit (靈) daily brightens and one's abilities (能) daily grow, so that the gradual enlargement of one's character (人格) is mutually recognized by oneself and others (人我), is this not the first joy?

If even small good deeds and minor merits (寸善尺功) daily benefit the world (世), so that one can be confident that their current life (當時의 生活) fulfills the duty (本務) of being a member of the community (共同生活體), is this not the second joy?

Whether through virtue (德), merit (功), or words (言); whether in the court (朝) or in the wilderness (野); whether prominent (顯) or obscure (微); if one lives constantly in the belief that by means of the highest good (至善), one will gradually influence the whole generation (一世), edify oneself and others (自他를 薰化), and become a great exemplar (大法人) transcending time (時間) and space (空間), is this not the third joy? <89>

**Summary**

This article contrasts the classical "Three Joys" of Mencius (Maengja)—living without shame, family well-being, and educating talent—with a different set attributed to Master Ch'oe Yuktang (Ch'oe Nam-seon). Yuktang's three joys are: 1) Experiencing the mutually recognized growth of one's spirit, ability, and character; 2) Finding confidence in fulfilling one's community duty through daily contributions, however small; 3) Living with the conviction of achieving timeless, universal influence through virtue, merit, or words, thereby becoming a "great exemplar" (大法人) regardless of one's status. For historians, this piece offers insight into the evolving philosophy of Ch'oe Nam-seon, a major intellectual figure whose legacy is complicated by accusations of later collaboration. His redefined "joys," focusing on personal cultivation, societal contribution, and achieving a transcendent legacy, might reflect an attempt to find meaning and purpose, or perhaps justify a path of accommodation, within the constraints of colonial rule, shifting focus away from overt political action towards inner development and lasting influence.

六堂先生의 三樂
昔에 孟子는 仰不愧於天俯不怍於人, 父母兄弟妻子無故, 得天下英才而敎育之로써 三樂이라 하얏다. 그런대 崔六堂 先生은 어느 機會에 알에와 가티 三樂을 말하얏다.
靈이 日明하고 能히 日長하야 人格의 漸大함을 人我가 共認할만 하면 是 一樂이 안일가. 寸善尺功이라도 日로 世를 益함이 有하야 當時의 生活이 共同生活體의 一員된 本務를 行한 줄노 自信할만 하면 是 二樂이 안일가. 德으로던지, 功으로던지, 言으로던지, 朝에서던지, 野에서던지, 顯에서던지, 微에서던지 至善으로써 一世를 漸被하고 自他를 薰化하야 時間, 空間을 超越하는 大法人이 되리라는 信念 中에 恒時 生活함을 得한다 하면 是 三樂이 안일가.＜89＞
