기사형태	논설 (Editorial/Opinion Piece)


The spirit of Confucianism lies solely in realizing the teachings of the Five Relationships (五倫) in human society. Therefore, those who aspire today to the revival of Confucianism must first properly uphold their family rules (家法) and practice the Way (道). If they simply do this, Confucianism will revive by itself on some unexpected day, without awaiting any strategy. Departing from this Way, what benefit is there to the clarification of Confucianism even if one idly speaks of the nuances of Human Nature and Principle (性理) or discusses the nuances of the Four Beginnings (四端)? As anyone would acknowledge, the true teachings of Confucianism are clearly recorded in the sagely scriptures and worthies' transmissions (聖經賢傳), and even if any sort of person were to emerge today and attempt to lecture on and clarify this Way, they could never possibly surpass that.

According to what I have heard, several organizations such as the Confucianism Promotion Society (儒道振興會), the Great Eastern Literati Society (大東斯文會), and the T'aegŭkkyo (太極敎) have sprung up from the Confucian world, appearing to vigorously discuss the clarification of this Way. However, as mentioned above, Confucianism will not necessarily be revived just by doing so. In the present day, even if one were to perform the Village Wine-Drinking Ceremony (鄕飮酒禮) from time to time and issue the Directives of the Director of the Academy Assembly (掌議齋長帖) daily, what effect would it have? The Confucianism of Chosŏn (朝鮮) has, in fact, declined due to tedious formalities and cumbersome etiquette (煩文褥禮); aiming for the revival of this Way today, yet seeking to tread again the rut of decline (衰微의 覆轍), is something I cannot understand. If, like Christianity (基督敎) or other churches, an organizational basis is already established and the source of funds is secure, then establishing its halls and practicing its way would not be impossible. However, the Confucian world realistically does not have the means to do so, and at the same time, one should not merely imitate their superficial expressions (嚬笑) just because everyone else in the world does so. A gentleman is ashamed when his reputation exceeds reality (聲聞過情). Today, the Confucian world should not reenact its past disgraceful state of much talk and little action (言多行少), but should solely rely on the constant ethical principles (彛倫), properly uphold the family rules (家法), and ensure that each person individually first lives according to the true spirit of Confucianism. This is what will truly revive Confucianism today, and it is also the attitude the Confucian world should adopt. <16>

**Summary**

In this piece, Kim Yun-sik argues that the revival of Korean Confucianism hinges on individual ethical practice—specifically upholding the Five Relationships and family rules—rather than intellectual debates on doctrine, the formation of numerous organizations, or the performance of complex rituals. He contends that Confucianism's past decline resulted from excessive formalism and warns against repeating this mistake or simply imitating the organizational structures of other religions like Christianity, especially without the necessary resources. Instead, he urges Confucians to focus on embodying the true spirit of Confucianism through personal conduct, avoiding the "disgraceful state" of empty words exceeding deeds. From a historical perspective, the article offers insight into the internal struggles and debates within the Korean Confucian community during the colonial period as it confronted modernization and the perceived erosion of traditional values. It highlights a conservative, practice-focused perspective resisting both purely intellectual approaches and organized movements potentially influenced by Western models, reflecting anxieties about authenticity and the practical application of Confucian ethics in a changing society.

儒林界를 爲하야
						雲養 金允植氏 談
儒道의 精神은 오즉 五倫의 敎를 人生社會에 實現케 함에 在하니 故로 今日 儒道의 振興에 志를 有한 者는 自己가 먼저 家法을 善守하며 그 道를 踐行하여야 할지니. 그리하기만 하면 아모 策略을 기다릴 것 업시 儒道는 不期何日에 스스로 振興될 것이라. 此 道에 不出하고 空히 性理의 如何를 말하며 四端의 如何를 論한다 한덜 儒道의 闡明에 何益이 有하리요. 誰이나 認할 것이어니와 儒道의 眞理敎訓은 聖經賢傳에 昭然히 記載된 것인바 今日 비록 如何한 人이 出하야 斯道의 講明을 試한다 할지라도 到底 그 以上에 至치 못할 것이다.
所聞에 依하면 儒道振興會, 大東斯文會, 太極敎 等 幾多 團體가 儒林界로부터 簇出하야 盛히 斯道의 闡明을 論議하는 貌樣이나 右에도 말한 것과 가티 儒道는 반듯이 그리한다고 振興될 것이 아니라 今日에 在하야 비록 鄕飮酒禮를 時時로 行하고 掌議齋長帖을 日日이 出한다 한덜 其效가 무엇이리요. 朝鮮의 儒道는 事實로 煩文褥禮에 衰微하얏나니 斯道의 振興을 策한다는 今日에 在하야 又復 衰微의 覆轍을 밟고저 함은 나의 아지 못할 일이라. 彼 基督敎이나 其他 敎會와 如히 組織的의 根據가 旣成하고 且 金錢의 出處가 確實하면 立其堂行其道도 不可함이 아니나 儒林으로서는 事實 그리할 形便을 가지지 못한 同時에 世上이 다 그러한다고 한갓 그 嚬笑를 效할 것이 아니라 聲聞過情을 君子는 恥하나니 今日 儒林界에서는 從來의 言多行少한 그 醜態를 再演치 말고 오로지 彛倫에 據하며 그 家法을 善守하야 其身 各自가 먼저 儒道의 참 精神에 살도록 할 것이니 是가 即 今日에 在하야 儒道를 참으로 振興케 하는 것이며 또 儒林界로서 可取할 態度이라 하노라.＜16＞
