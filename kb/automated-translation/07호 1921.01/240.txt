The Sinyu Year 60 Years Ago; Don't Be Surprised, One *Turok* of Paddy Land Cost Only Six *Chŏn*, and Kangjin Cotton Clothes Made You the Most High-Collar Person in Chang'an
						One Reporter

Comparing this New Year's Sinyu with the Sinyu year 60 years ago, the most surprisingly drastic changes would be the high prices of goods and the extravagance versus frugality in customs. In those days, speaking of clothing items, not only were today's silks and brocades (綾羅綢緞) unused, but even native Chosŏn silk (明紬) was limited to the royal palace families and powerful aristocratic households (世道家). Ordinary families used Chosŏn native cotton (朝鮮本木, *mumyŏng*). Among this cotton, the Kangjin weave (康津나이) was the most famous, so if one made outer clothes with it, they became the number one "high-collar" person in Chang'an [the capital, Seoul]. Although Western cotton (西洋木) existed at that time, its quality was considered too luxurious, so the general public dared not use it. There was even an instance where an official bought some, had official attire (冠帶) made, and wore it to the Royal Court, only to be pointed at by everyone for committing excessive luxury, making it impossible for him to maintain his position. Also, back then, there was nothing like the *churŭi* (周衣, lined jacket) of today; instead, everyone wore the *ch'angŭi* (氅衣, overcoat). Children's clothes were generally dyed crimson (*tanghong*), so on New Year's Day, the streets truly presented a spectacle of myriad purples and reds (萬紫千紅). Furthermore, today, no matter how poor a household, white paper is used for papering inside and outside the rooms (塗禙), and if slightly better off, even patterned paper (花紋紙) is used. But in those days, except for special aristocratic households, one dared not use white paper; only scrap paper (体紙) destined for waste was used. Speaking of prices, at that time, one *turok* [unit of land area] of paddy field (畓一斗落) was quoted at up to six *chŏn* (六錢), and for ten *chŏn* or more, one could buy even fields of gold and jade (金田玉畓). As for the price of rice, one *mal* [unit of volume] of *hwangin* rice (黃印一斗) was quoted at a maximum of nine *pun* (九分), and a pair (二尾) of dried pollack (*piut*) went for up to six *pun*. Nowadays, no matter how common money is and how extravagant customs have become, a person like me keeps thinking of those times<105> — no, it has become a habit. Despite the old saying "at fifty, one does not feel warm without silk" (五十에 非帛不暖), even now, having passed seventy, I dare not let silk touch my body, nor can I bear to waste even a single *p'un* of money. The other day, my neck felt cool, and I thought it would be nice to wear a neck scarf in the new style, so I looked for one. But hearing the price would be at least around three *wŏn*, the figure was appalling. So I bought a few feet of soft cotton (軟木), put in a little padding, and wrapped it around my neck. How warm and nice it felt... And back then, the distinction between elders (*chonjang*, 尊丈) and juniors (*siha saeng*, 侍下生) was terribly strict. When an elder addressed a junior attendant, it was customarily *haera* [plain imperative speech level]. As customs changed somewhat, it became *hage* [semi-formal imperative]. But today, one cannot but use polite address (相禮) even towards any young junior attendant. Sixty years ago, it was an era when one couldn't even hear talk of today's telegraph and telephone (電信電話), let alone use them. Never mind then; even 20 years after that Sinyu year, when I was 22, I toured Japan and came back talking about what the telegraph and telephone were like. Everyone generally said I was talking crazy... (The above is based on the words of Mr. Yi Sang-jae (李商在), Secretary-General of the Youth Center (青年會舘), who was merely a 12-year-old youth in the old Sinyu year.)

Due to Grain Loan Abuses, Peasant Revolts Arose Everywhere, and a Red Omen Persisted for Three Days and Nights
Politically, there were no particularly unusual events in the past Sinyu year, but one thing that cannot be overlooked is the outbreak of peasant revolts (民亂) in various parts of Chosŏn in the winter of that Sinyu year. Since the Koryŏ Dynasty, Chosŏn had a system called the *Hwansang* Law (還上法), implemented under government direction. This law involved establishing appropriate warehouses (倉庫) in various localities under government offices. The general populace was required to deposit a portion of their harvested grain into these warehouses during each harvest season. This grain was then returned (還附) to the people during the lean spring (窮春) or lean summer (窮夏) of the following year. That is, it was a system born out of the good intentions of administrators to store surplus grain from abundant periods for supplementary use during times of scarcity, echoing the savings systems (貯金制度) practiced in various countries today. However, because this *hwansang* was conducted under the direction of government officials, official discipline slackened midway, leading to many instances contrary to the original spirit of *hwansang*. Especially towards the end of the Yi Dynasty, government decrees came entirely from the households of the royal family's maternal relatives (王室外戚), bribery (苞苴) became openly practiced in the official world, and local officials largely became cohorts sucking the lifeblood (膏血) of the people. The traditional *Hwansang* Law thus turned into a means of seizing the people's grain. Specifically, at first, large measures (大斗) were used when collecting grain from the people, and small measures (小斗) were used when returning it from the government office. The abuse worsened daily, and next, the grain returned to the people was filled half with rice and half with sand (沙半部). Finally, even that was not returned, and the entire amount was seized. Consequently, the resentful cries (怨聲) of the general populace filled the heavens. Initially, they appealed plaintively to the local officials<106>, but eventually, it all turned into popular disturbances (*minyo*, 民擾). Some burned down warehouses (倉庫), while others burned officials to death, killed them (燒殺), or expelled them (逐出). These disturbances began in the winter of the past Sinyu year [1861] and greatly intensified in the following Imsul year [1862]. The government inevitably abolished the *Hwansang* Law entirely, barely bringing the situation to a close. From this point, a mood for reform (改革) in the government and society markedly permeated the entire country, with undercurrents (暗流) seen everywhere. Not long after, the Imo Military Mutiny (壬午軍變) occurred, the Kapsin Reforms (甲申改革) were carried out, and the Kapo Tonghak Rebellion (甲午東學亂) broke out. These disturbances, which started in the winter of Sinyu and extended into Imsul, originated mainly in the Sannam region (三南, three southern provinces), and among them, Chinju (晋州) in Kyŏngsang Province (慶尙道) was particularly severe. The government dispatched an *Anhyŏsa* (安惠使, special commissioner for relief and pacification) to the area to strive for appeasement (鎭撫).
Also, in the winter of the past Sinyu year, there was an unprecedented great celestial phenomenon (大天變). Specifically, half of the sky, the western half stretching from north to south, displayed a pure red color (純赤色). This appearance continued for three days and three nights (三晝三夜). During the daytime, due to sunlight, it was not so severe, but at night, the red light (赤光) wielded great power, turning the earth into a completely red-lit world (紅光世界). It manifested strange phenomena like birds crying out in the forests and beasts stirring in the mountains, causing considerable alarm (驚愕) among the general populace. The weather at that time was very clear and sunny (晴天). And the year's agricultural outcome (年事) was generally close to a bountiful year (豊年) in most provinces. (The above is based on the words of Mr. Kim Yun-sik (金允植), pen name Unyang (雲養).) <107>

**Summary**

This article contrasts the Sinyu year of 1861 with the (implied) Sinyu year of 1921, based on interviews with Yi Sang-jae and Kim Yun-sik. Yi recalls the extreme frugality of 1861, where basic cotton was standard, silk was rare, homes used scrap paper, land and goods were incredibly cheap, social hierarchies were strict, and modern technologies like the telegraph were unknown or unbelievable. Kim recounts the political turmoil of 1861, specifically the widespread peasant revolts sparked by corruption in the government's *hwansang* grain loan system, culminating in the system's abolition and foreshadowing later major upheavals. He also describes a startling three-day celestial event where the sky turned red. For historians, the article offers valuable first-hand (or near first-hand) accounts of dramatic socio-economic shifts, the lived experience of late Chosŏn administrative failure (the *hwansang* collapse), popular memory of significant historical/natural events, and the perspective of elderly Koreans reflecting on the past during the early colonial period.

六十年 前의 辛酉年, 놀라지 마라 畓一斗落갑이 겨우 六錢 康津木衣服이면 長安에 一等 하이칼라
						一記者
新年의 이 辛酉와 60年 前의 辛酉年 當時와 比하야 가장 놀라웁게 激變한 것은 物價의 高價와 風俗의 奢儉이라 하겟소. 그 當時에는 衣服品으로 말하면 今日의 綾羅綢緞을 不用한 것은 勿論이요, 朝鮮 土産의 明紬와 如함도 王宮家와 큰 世道家에 限하야뿐 着用하고 一般 家庭에서는 朝鮮本木(무명)을 用하얏는데 이 무명 中에는 康津나이(産)가 第一 有名하얏슴으로 그것으로써 웃옷을 製着하기만 하면 長安에 一等 하이칼라가 되엇스며 그때에도 西洋木이 有하기는 하얏스나 그 品이 太侈하다 하야 一般은 敢히 此를 用치 못하얏는데 어느 官員이 此를 買入하야 冠帶를 지어입고 朝廷에 立하얏다가 過分의 奢侈를 行하얏다고 一般이 指目을 與하야 다시 容身을 못한 例도 有하얏다 하오. 그리고 그때에는 只今과 가티 周衣라는 것이 無하고 全혀 氅衣를 着하되 幼年着은 大槪 당홍染色을 行하야 正月 1日의 市街는 實로 萬紫千紅의 觀이 有하얏스며 더욱 今日에 在하야는 如何히 貧寒한 家庭이라도 房 內外의 塗禙에는 다 白紙를 用하며 족음 웬만하면 花紋紙까지 用하되 그 當時에 在하야는 特別 世道家門을 除한 外에는 敢히 白紙를 用치 못하고 廢物에 歸한 体紙뿐을 用하얏스며 物價로 말하면 그때는 畓一斗落에 六錢까지 呼하야 拾錢 以上이면 金田玉畓이라도 買得하얏스며 米價로 말하면 黃印一斗에 最高로 九分을 呼하얏고 비웃한 두릅(二尾)에 六分까지 하얏소. 只今은 아모리 돈이 흔하고 風俗이 侈하게 되엇다 할지라도 나가튼 사람은 每樣 그때 생각이＜105＞ 나서, 아니 그것이 習慣이 되어 50에 非帛不暖이라는 옛말이 잇슴에 不拘하고 七旬餘의 今日에 至하기까지 敢히 비단옷을 몸에 다히지 못하며 돈 한푼이라도 참아 濫費는 못하오. 日前에 목이 서늘하기로 新式투로 목돌이를 하얏스면 조흘 듯하야 그것을 求하야 보앗는데 價格이 少하야도 三圓 假量은 되겟다 함으로 말이 끔찍하야 軟木 幾尺을 買하야 솜을 좀 너허 둘럿더니 어찌 뜻뜻하고 조핫는지... 그리고 그 때는 尊丈侍生의 別이 끔찍히 甚하얏지요. 尊丈이 侍下生을 對하면 依例히 해라이엇고 그 風俗이 좀 變하며 하게를 하더니 今日은 如何한 靑年侍生에게 對하야도 相禮하지 안흐면 아니되게 되엇소. 60年 前의 그때에는 今日의 電信電話는 勿論 말도 못듯던 時代이엇소. 그때는 그만두고 辛酉年으로부터 20年을 經하야 내가 22歲 되던 그때에도 내가 日本을 遊覽하고 돌아와 電信電話의 如何를 말하얏더니 一般은 모다 나다려 미친 소리 한다 하얏소...

還弊로 民亂이 到處에 起하고 赤眚이 三日三夜에 連互하다
過去 辛酉年에 政治的으로는 特別한 異常은 無하얏는데 그 中에 看過치 못할 것은 辛酉年 冬에 朝鮮 各地에 民亂이 勃發한 것이다. 朝鮮에는 高麗朝 以降으로 政府의 指揮下에서 施行하야 온 還上法이란 것이 有하얏다. 이 法은 官廳으로부터 地方 各處에 相當 倉庫를 設하고 一般 人民으로 하야금 每年 收穫期에는 自家 收穫穀物 中 幾分을 그 倉庫에 納入케 하얏다가 그 翌年의 窮春 或은 窮夏에 此를 人民에게 還附하는 것이니 即 豊足期의 剩穀을 貯蓄하얏다가 窮乏할 時에 補用케 하고저 하는 施政家의 好意에서 出한 制度이니 今日 各國에 行하는 貯金制度와 同曲異調이엇다. 그런데 此 還上은 官憲의 指揮下에서 行하게 된 關係上 中途官紀가 解弛하야지며 還上 當初의 精神에 違反된 事가 多하얏고 더욱 李朝末葉에 至하야 政令이 專혀 王室外戚의 門에서 出하게 되며 官界에 苞苴가 公行하야 地方官吏는 자못 人民의 膏血을 吮하는 徒輩가 되매 從來의 還上法은 民穀을 奪取하는 方便이 되고 말앗다. 卽 처음에는 民間으로부터 收穀할 時는 大斗을 用하고 官廳으로부터 還附할 時는 小斗를 用하다가 其弊가 日甚하야 其次에는 民間에 還附하는 穀物에는 米半部에 沙半部를 充하고 最終에는 그도저도 還附치 아니하고 全部 奪取 乃已함에 一般 民衆의 怨聲이 漲天하며 처음은 地方官憲에게 哀訴하＜106＞다가 終에는 모다 民擾로 化하야 或은 倉庫를 焚하고 官憲을 燒殺 或 逐出하얏는데 此 民擾는 過去 辛酉의 冬에 起하야 그 翌年 壬戌년에 其勢 大盛한 바 政府로서는 不得已 還上法을 全廢하고 겨우 終局을 告하얏는데 是로부터 政府 及 社會에 改革의 氣分이 자못 全國에 漲溢하야 到處에 暗流를 見하던 바 그 後 얼마가 못되어 壬午軍變이 起하고 甲申改革이 行하고 甲午東學亂이 勃發하얏다. 그런데 이때 辛酉 冬에 起하야 壬戌에 亘한 民擾는 三南을 中心으로 하야 起한 것이며 其中에도 慶尙道 晋州가 特甚하얏는데 政府에서는 該地에 安惠使를 委送하야 鎭撫에 努力하얏다.
그리고 過去 辛酉年 冬에는 未曾有의 大天變이 有하얏다. 卽 天空半部ㅣ 北으로부터 南에 亘하는 以西의 天半部는 純赤色을 呈하야 그 貌樣이 三晝三夜를 繼하얏는데 白晝에는 日光이 有함으로 그러텃 甚치 못하얏스나 夜에는 그 赤光이 크게 威를 肆하야 大地는 아조 紅光世界가 되며 林間에는 새가 다울고 山中에 즘생이 動하는 怪狀을 現出하야 一般의 驚愕이 不少하얏는데 當時의 日氣는 아조 깨끗한 晴天이엇스며 그리고 當年의 年事는 各道가 大槪 豊年에 近하얏섯다. (右는 雲養 金允植 先生의 말슴에 依함)＜107＞
