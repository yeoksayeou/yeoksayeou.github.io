翠雲 圖書館頌 小序
						敬庵居士 李瓘撰

Paektong (白洞) is secluded yet spacious; Ch'wiun Pavilion (翠亭) is fresh and bright. That the books of our Ch'ŏnggu (靑邱, Korea) are now housed here, is it not so? My friend Yun Cha Ik-sŏn (尹子益善) is excellent in learning and teaching; scholars look up to him as a teacher, and fellow believers respect his position. He constantly worried that the humanities (人文) were stagnant and underdeveloped, that popular customs were deteriorating and impure. In nurturing talent and promoting culture (育材興化), he was diligent day after day, never knowing fatigue. He said, "Although our Kŭnyŏk (槿域, Korea) has for several hundred years boasted of being like the civilized Chou and Confucian Sung dynasties (文周儒宋), the remnants of its achievements are merely a desperate pursuit of profit (嗜利) and a reckless disregard for shame (蔑耻). We fall short of others yet do not reflect upon ourselves. How lamentable!"

Indeed, throughout history, nations establishing themselves have invariably set up libraries (圖書之館) and halls for classical studies (經義之齋), enabling everyone to observe, feel, and be inspired. Therefore, on occasions of great national celebrations or sorrows, when the gazes of many officials and scholars converge, they must display the Diagrams from the River and the Writings from the Luo (河之圖洛之書), materials for awe-inspiring instruction like the Great Teachings and the Red Knife (大訓赤刀), and precious objects like splendid jade and patterned cowries placed on stands (華玉文貝仍几之物). All are laid out for display, allowing people to view them freely, to draw lessons from the past and verify the present, thereby examining the progress or decline of civilization, the rise or fall of Dao and vessels (道器), the crudeness or refinement of material things. It broadens our horizons, moves our hearts, and reveals the world's phenomena, managing the world's affairs. If so, how great is the benefit and supplement (裨補) of books to the human mind and the ways of the world?

Yet in our country, even now in major cities (通都大市), there is not a single library (圖館) to meet the public's need for reading, nor an "art garden" (藝圃) to provide people with a place for intellectual recreation. What could be more shameful? Thus, he gathered like-minded comrades (倡同志), collected books, borrowed (倩) and renovated the Ch'wiun Pavilion (翠雲亭), repaired (緝) its roof tiles, painted (塗) its walls with red ochre (雘), prepared cabinets (龕藏), chairs, tables, and display equipment, and comprehensively gathered (賅而備之) blue-and-yellow silk-bound volumes (縹緗方冊) and books for browsing. He appointed a capable friend as library director to be the mainstay and initiated the Kwangmunhoe (光文會) to act as rear support. Already, we see families with sincere will and a love of righteousness (篤志嗜義) rising like clouds and surging like waves; some have remotely sent over ten thousand volumes of records (載籍), and some have righteously donated over a thousand *hwan* of currency. Is not the beginning (權輿) of spreading culture and clarifying teachings (敷文闡敎) in our East located right here? With this, Yun Cha has successfully fulfilled his long-held aspiration. An ode is composed for this, saying:

The Cave of the White Deer (白廘之洞), the Pavilion of Jade Clouds (翠雲之亭),
Unique in the capital's upper reaches (大都上遊), missing in the nation until now.
A library of books (圖書之館), now makes its appearance.
What diagrams are these diagrams? What books are these books?
Ten thousand gazes focus as one.
From the East's bird tracks (東之鳥跡) to the West's crab-like script (西之蟹行),
Vastly embracing both spheres (弘含兩球).
The rustic observes and becomes cultured; the ignorant reads and becomes wise.
Where can this not be sought?
There is Master Yun, the early enlightened one (先覺),
Who carried out his former aspiration, achieving a great and auspicious harvest.
I, Kwan (瓘), compose this ode,
Seeking blessings (徼惠) from spirits and men, for thousands and tens of thousands of autumns.＜124＞

**Summary**

This article celebrates the opening of the private Ch'wiun Library in Paektong (likely Seoul), established through the efforts of Yun Ik-sŏn and supported by community donations and the Kwangmunhoe. The author, Yi Kwan, laments the lack of public libraries and cultural institutions in Korea, contrasting the nation's past cultural pride with its current state, which he sees as marked by materialism and a lack of self-reflection. The library is presented as a vital step towards cultural revival, education, and moral upliftment, embodying the hopes for preserving and advancing Korean culture ("spreading culture and clarifying teachings") by encompassing both Eastern and Western knowledge. For historians, the article is significant as it reflects private Korean initiatives for cultural preservation and education during the colonial period, acting as a form of cultural resistance or nationalism. It highlights the perceived inadequacy of official (likely Japanese colonial) support for Korean cultural institutions and underscores the role of intellectuals and community efforts in maintaining cultural identity and promoting enlightenment amidst societal challenges.
