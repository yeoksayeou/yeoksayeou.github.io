**Body Text Translation:**
The Sea of Study

The sea of study, its front is far!
Go and go, yet cannot see the end.
The farther you go, the more distant it seems; do not fear (怯).
Our joy is there.

The summit of Success (成功), the path is perilous (險)!
Climb and climb, yet cannot reach the threshold.
The harder you strive, the more remote it seems; do not stop.
Our pleasure is there.

If not for the hardship, our iron arms' (鐵腕)
How could we test their refreshing display (發揮)?
If not for the peril (險), our iron legs' (鐵脚)
How could we have the satisfying test (試驗)?

The farther you go, the closer; the harder you strive, the lower [it becomes].
The far shore (彼岸) and the summit (上峰) will finally surrender (降服).
Will laughter not burst forth?
Our pride is infinite (無限大)!

(From Shimmun Tokpon 時文讀本) <128>

**Summary**

This poem uses the metaphors of a vast sea and a high mountain summit to describe the challenges of study and achieving success. It emphasizes that while the path is long, arduous, and seemingly endless, perseverance through hardship is key. The struggle itself tests one's strength ("iron arms," "iron legs"), and overcoming these difficulties brings ultimate joy, satisfaction, and infinite pride when the goal (the "far shore" or "summit") is finally reached. From a historical perspective, the poem, likely published during the colonial period, reflects themes of self-strengthening and endurance that were common in Korean discourse. The emphasis on overcoming immense difficulty through sheer will and effort could resonate with nationalist sentiments or calls for improvement and resilience in challenging times. The use of older Korean orthography is also notable.

공부의 바다
공부의 바다는 압이 멀고나
나가고 나가도 끗 못보겟네
갈스록 아득함 怯하지 마라
우리의 깃거움 거긔 잇도다.
成功의 마루는 길이 險코나
오르고 올라도 턱 못 다닷네
옐스록 까마타 멈추지 마라
우리의 질거움 거긔 잇도다.
머담이 아니면 우리 鐵腕의
시언한 發揮를 어찌 해보며
險함이 아니면 우리 鐵脚의
흐믓한 試驗을 어찌 해볼까.
갈스록 갓갑고 옐스록 나자
彼岸과 上峰이 降服코 마니
웃음이 북바쳐 아니 나올가
우리의 자랑이 無限大로다.
