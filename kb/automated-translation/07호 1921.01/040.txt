Happy New Year
						Choe Hyŏk

Like water, pure white
Like fire, passionate
Like the calendar, not behind the times
Like a clock, cherishing the time
Like a rifle, not missing the target
Like a sword, decisive
Like thunder, bold
Like electricity, agile
Like a telescope, far-reaching
Like a microscope, paying attention to small matters
Like an awl, consistent
Like a mallet, persistent
Like boots, one step, two steps
Like a mountain, immovable
Like river water, ceaselessly active
Like the great sea, broad-minded and generous
Like the sun, fair and just <15>

**Summary**

This poem, "Happy New Year," presents a series of aspirations or resolutions for the coming year. Each line uses a metaphor, comparing a desired personal quality to an element of nature or a modern object. The author exhorts the reader (or perhaps the nation) to be pure like water, passionate like fire, timely like a calendar and clock, focused like a rifle, decisive, bold, agile, visionary, meticulous, consistent, persistent, progressive, steadfast, active, broad-minded, and just. From a historical perspective, the poem reflects common themes of self-improvement and modernization prevalent during the Korean colonial period. The mix of natural elements with modern inventions (clock, rifle, electricity, telescope, microscope) highlights an embrace of or aspiration towards modernity, while the emphasis on virtues like persistence, consistency, and activity could be seen by historians as reflecting the desire for national strengthening or resilience under difficult circumstances.
