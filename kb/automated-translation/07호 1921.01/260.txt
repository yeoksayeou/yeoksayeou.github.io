Son Pyŏnghŭi, Third Patriarch of Ch'ŏndogyo
Born on the 8th day of the 4th month of Sin'yu (1861) in Taeju-ri, Ch'ŏngju-gun, he was the illegitimate son (庶子) of Son Ŭijo, a local functionary (鄕吏) of Ch'ŏngju.

In the winter of Imsin (壬申, 1872, age 12), under the command (命敎) of his legitimate elder brother, while going to the government office carrying 40 *nyang* of tax money (稅錢), he saw a beggar (一乞人) suffering from hunger and cold (飢寒) and about to freeze to death. He took 10 *nyang* from the tax money and gave it to the owner of a nearby inn to save the beggar.

In Pyŏngja (丙子, 1876, age 17), in Samga-ri, Kwesan, he witnessed an envoy (修信使) dragging a station postman (驛人) tied to a horse's tail (馬尾), with blood streaming (流血이 淋漓). Angered (憤慨) by the envoy's unreasonable and inhumane act, he drove away the horse servant (馬僕) with a wooden stick and released the tied postman.

In Kyŏngjin (庚辰, 1880, age 20), while walking at night in the Ch'ŏngju medicine market (藥市), he picked up (拾하고) 300 *nyang* of lost money (遺金). He sat there waiting all night (徹夜토록) for the person who lost the money, eventually finding the owner (本主) and returning it.

In Imo (壬午, 1882, age 22), he entered the Way (入道) of Tonghak (東學).

In Kapo (甲午, 1894, age 34), during the Tonghak Rebellion, when Chŏn Pongjun, the leader of the Southern Congregation (南接首領), raised the followers of the Way (道衆) on his own initiative (自意), not following (쫏지 아니하고) the command (命敎) of Master Haewŏl (海月 先生), Son Pyŏnghŭi, by order (命敎) of Master Haewŏl, denounced (聲討) Chŏn Pongjun.

In Chŏngyu (丁酉, 1897, age 37), he directly received the lineage of the Way (宗門道統) from Master Haewŏl.

In Musul (戊戌, 1898, age 38), in the 6th month, after Master Haewŏl received the death penalty by hanging (絞刑) in a prison in Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul) due to being targeted (指目) for Tonghak, he succeeded him to become the Third Patriarch (第三世敎主) of Ch'ŏndogyo.

In Sinch'uk (辛丑, 1901, age 41), in the 3rd month, he conspired (共謀) with his senior disciples (高弟) Pak Inho, Hong Pyŏnggi, Yi Chonghun, Son Pyŏnghŭm, Yi Yonggu, and others. To import the latest politics, morality, religion, literature, etc., from various countries around the world, he first went to Japan (渡日). At this time, under suspicion (嫌疑), he changed his name to Yi Sanghŏn and joined hands with contemporary Korean political offenders (韓國國事犯) Pak Yŏnghyo, Cho Ŭiyŏn, Kwŏn Tongjin, Yi Chinho, Cho Hŭimun, and others.

He dispatched (遣하야) Son Pyŏnghŭm to Korea to explain (說示케) the method to the followers of the Way (道衆), had Yi Yonggu establish a People's Association (民會), and sent a letter to the then Chief State Councilor (議政大臣) Yun Yongsŏn, explaining (陳述) remedial measures (善後策).

In Ŭlsa (乙巳, 1905, age 45), after Yi Yonggu, Song Pyŏngjun, and others failed to adhere (遵行치 안코) to the Four Great Principles (四大綱領) of the Ilchinhoe (一進會) and issued a declaration supporting the protectorate (保護宣言書), he summoned Yi Yonggu and 40 others, reprimanded them for their misunderstanding (誤解됨), and indicated the future course of action (前途方針).

However, as Yi Yonggu and others ultimately refused to comply (終乃 不從), he expelled (黜敎) Yi Yonggu and 61 other leaders involved in the Ilchinhoe.

**Summary**

This article from *Kaebyŏk* magazine presents biographical sketches of four prominent Korean figures born in the Sin'yu year (1861): Son Pyŏnghŭi (Ch'ŏndogyo leader), Pak Yŏnghyo (reformer, politician, royal relative), Yu Kŭn (journalist, educator), and Kwŏn Tongjin (military official, Ch'ŏndogyo leader, independence activist). It details their key life events, career paths, involvement in significant historical occurrences like the Tonghak Rebellion, Kapsin Coup, Ilchinhoe activities, establishment of modern institutions (schools, newspapers), and culminating in their roles in the March 1st Independence Movement of 1919 (for Son and Kwŏn).

From a historical perspective, the article is valuable for its contemporary (likely early 1920s, given *Kaebyŏk*'s publication dates and the content ending around 1919) portrayal of figures central to Korea's tumultuous transition from the late Chosŏn dynasty through the early colonial period. It highlights the complex interplay between religious movements (Tonghak/Ch'ŏndogyo), political reform efforts, collaboration and resistance against Japanese influence (e.g., Ilchinhoe conflict, independence declaration), and the establishment of modern media and education. The details on internal Ch'ŏndogyo leadership changes and conflicts, Pak Yŏnghyo's repeated exiles and returns, and the specific roles held by these individuals offer insights into the networks, ideologies, and challenges faced by Korean elites during this era.
