**Summary**

These regulations outline the terms for establishing and operating local distribution centers (分賣所) for the monthly magazine *Kaebyŏk* (開闢). They detail the application process, commission structure (6 chon per copy, 30% for ads), responsibilities (sales, delivery, payments, etc.), the requirement of a security deposit (1 won per copy) or joint guarantors, interest paid on deposits, payment deadlines, penalties for late payment (deduction from deposit, contract termination), and procedures for returning unsold copies. Historically, this document provides insight into the business operations and distribution network of a prominent Korean nationalist magazine during the Japanese colonial period (likely 1920). It reveals the financial arrangements, risk management (security deposits, guarantors), and logistical considerations necessary to circulate such a publication widely, showing a degree of formalized business practice within the constraints of the era.
