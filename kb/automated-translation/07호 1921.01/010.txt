年頭辭 (New Year's Address)

The year has already become new. Along with last night's cockcrow, we have somehow crossed the boundary between old and new. We are already no longer the old people of former days. We cannot help but be the new people of the New Year.

Ah, we who face the New Year! Let those with purpose exert their firm strength once, and let those without purpose heave a long sigh once. Let the strong laugh once, and let the old shed tears once.

Ah, we on the occasion of the New Year! What are our hopes, what are our expectations for ourselves? Have we not already taken all discontent, dissatisfaction, irrationality, and lack of thoroughness and buried them away along with last night's cockcrow? Are not our hopes, our expectations for ourselves, surely equality, satisfaction, rationality, and thoroughness?

Brothers! If you aspire to equality, if you aspire to satisfaction, if you hope for rationality and thoroughness, let us reach the point we have pledged. Let us not yield it next year, nor postpone it to the future, but only within this year.

Brothers! Time definitely does not wait for us, so we must always be busy and constantly active. For us, there is not a second of leisure, nor a moment for personal feelings; we must only be prudent and each exert our own reason, only advance ourselves and each reach our own hopes.

Brothers! The year is new. We too must become new people. New people have new intentions and do new things, so having become new people, we must each proceed in new directions.

We must advance steadfastly, concerned that if we stumble while advancing, we will fall, and concerned that if we fall, we will perish.

Brothers! How could there not be a new pledge in the New Year? For our peace and happiness, for the construction of a New Korean Culture, strive and endeavor until the end. How about making the Sinyu year (辛酉年) a great epoch for the construction of a New Korean Culture? Let us, who face this New Year, pledge this heavily to each other.

**Summary**

This New Year's editorial from *Kaebyŏk* magazine is a passionate call to action for Koreans. It urges readers ("Brothers!") to shed the past's dissatisfactions and embrace the New Year as "new people" with new purpose. The author exhorts readers to strive relentlessly for ideals like equality, satisfaction, rationality, and thoroughness, emphasizing urgency as time waits for no one. The ultimate goal proposed is the "Construction of a New Korean Culture," with the specific call to make the current year, Sinyu (辛酉年, 1921), a foundational epoch for this cultural renewal, sealed by a mutual pledge.

From a historical perspective, this article is significant for its fervent nationalist tone and its focus on cultural construction during the Japanese colonial period. Published shortly after the March 1st Movement (1919), it reflects the ongoing desire for self-determination and modernization channeled into the cultural sphere, possibly as a less overtly political avenue under colonial suppression. The emphasis on rationality, self-reliance ("each exert our own reason"), and building a distinctly *Korean* new culture (朝鮮의 新文化) would be of interest to historians studying Korean intellectual thought, nationalism, and cultural movements in the early 1920s. The specific dating to Sinyu year (1921) firmly places it within the context of post-March 1st Movement aspirations.

年頭辭
해는 이미 새로웟도다. 昨夜의 鷄鳴聲과 共히 우리는 어느덧 新舊界線을 넘어섯도다. 우리는 벌서 舊日의 舊人은 아니다. 어찌할 수 업시 新年의 新人이엇도다.
아- 新年을 當한 우리! 뜻이 잇는 者ㅣ 한번 써 구든 힘을 쓸 것이며 뜻이 업는 者ㅣ 한번 써 長太息을 發할 것이로다. 壯者ㅣ 한번 써 웃을 것이며 老子ㅣ 한번 써 눈물지을 것이로다.
아- 新年을 際한 우리! 그-希望이 무엇이며 그 自期가 무엇일가? 우리는 일즉 모든 不平·不滿·不合理·不徹底를 들어 昨夜의 鷄鳴聲과 共히 埋去하고 已 하얏나니 우리의 希望, 우리의 自期야 毋論 平等·滿足·合理·徹底가 아니겟느냐?
兄弟들아! 平等을 期하얏거던, 滿足을 期하얏거던, 合理와 徹底를 希望하거던, 期約한 그대로 어대까지 到達하야보자. 來年에도 讓渡치 말고 將來에도 推移치 말고 오즉 今年으로써
兄弟들아! 歲月은 決코 우리를 기다리지 아니하나니 우리는 恒時 多忙하야 줄곳 活動하여야 되겟다. 우리에게는 一抄의 餘裕도 업고 一分의 私情도 업나니 오즉 自重하야써 各自가 各自의 理性을 發揮할 따름이며 오즉 自進하야써 各自가 各自의 希望을 到達할 뿐이로다.
兄弟들아! 해는 새로엇도다. 우리도 새사람이 되어야겟도다. 새사람은 새뜻이 잇고 새로운 일을 하는 것이니 우리는 새사람이 된 下에서 다 各其 새方面으로 進行할 뿐이로다.
나아가다가 거꿀어질심 잡고 거꿀어지면 滅亡할심 잡고 줄곳 꾸준히 나아가야겟도다.
兄弟들아! 新年에 어찌 새로운 期約이 업슬가보냐. 우리의 安寧 幸福을 爲하야, 朝鮮의 新文化 建設을 爲하야 어대까지 奮鬪 努力하라. 그리하야 辛酉年으로써 朝鮮 新文化 建設의 一大 紀元을 삼음이 어떠하냐? 이* 新年을 當한 吾人으로써 서로 重盟할 것이로다
