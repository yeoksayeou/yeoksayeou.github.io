Literary World Tidbits
Mr. Sŏ Yŏnghae (徐領海), a compatriot residing in France (佛國) who previously published the book 『Chosŏn Life』 (朝鮮生活相) in French, is said to have published another collection of Korean folktales titled 『The Misfortune of the Bright Mirror』 (明鏡의 不幸) in December last year at the Figuière (피기에─르) Bookstore in Paris (巴里).
It is said that in the preface of this book, he substituted a preface with his fervent sincerity of loving his compatriots, and that its distinctiveness and appeal lie in its content, which primarily focuses on a purely Korean local character (朝鮮的 鄕土性) and Korean simplicity (朝鮮的 素朴性).

Mr. Yi Kwangsu (李光洙), who had remained silent for a long time, gave a literary lecture over two consecutive days before the New Year at the Kyŏngsŏng Broadcasting Station (京城放送局) under the title 『Composition, Literature, and the Man of Letters』. This became a topic of conversation among gossip lovers as he reportedly volunteered and requested the broadcast himself. However, it was later revealed that there was indeed an admirable, tearful "episode" behind it. A close friend (親友) of Mr. Yi, a certain Mr. So-and-so who is in Wŏnsan Prison (元山刑務所), had requested some money. As Yi happened to have no money to send, he thought about it, <76> sacrificed his speech (辯說) for two days for his friend's sake, and met his request with the income (所得) earned. Truly a commendable deed.
★
The Arts and Culture Department (學藝部) of a certain newspaper (某 新聞) selected fifteen young, established writers (中堅作家) before the New Year to serialize short stories. While most have already been published, the newspaper is incurring the displeasure (不平) of some writers by rejecting the publication (揭載) of the remaining stories under the pretext (口實) of New Year scheduling issues and other unreasonable excuses, even after commissioning them. This is said to be an act that ignores Chosŏn's writers and only considers the newspaper's own face (體面).
★
Mr. Ch'oe Tok[...] (崔獨■), who had stopped writing newspaper novels for a long time, suddenly announced a full-length novel (長篇) titled 『Spring of the Heart』 in the Maeil Sinbo (每申) before the New Year and is currently writing (執筆 中) it. However, before the novel has even reached forty installments, the issue of the novel's mo[tif] (모■ 問題) is already emerging. According to reliable investigation (探聞), it is said to be based on the story of Mr. S (S氏) from a certain association (某會), who was involved in a dispute incident (紛叫事件), and Ms. P (P氏), an intellectual woman (인테리 女性) who once caused a great sensation (一大 『쎈세이슌』) in Chosŏn's women's circles (女性界). However, while hoping and believing (미더 바라는) this is not the case, we also hope that this novel will not be discontinued (■■되지) like the one based on the Yi Su[...] (李洙■) patricide incident (殺父悖子) that was serialized in a certain paper (某紙).
★
Mr. Yi Sŏkhun (李石薰)—even amidst his busy schedule (밧분 中)—applied anonymously (匿名) to a certain paper's New Year's prize essay contest (新春懸賞論文). He was delighted not only to gain the honor (榮譽) of fortunately (多幸히) winning first prize (一等 當選) but also to receive a comfortable fifty Wŏn (五拾圓) in prize money (賞金). However, in a case of misfortune in fortune (多幸 中 不幸) rather than fortune in misfortune (不幸 中 多幸), the old man (老人) suddenly suffered a sudden illness (急病), was hospitalized in the Medical College Hospital (醫專病院) for a long time, and incurred unexpected expenses (意外의 費用) several times the amount of the prize money upon his discharge. Friends and acquaintances (親知) who know this fact, seeing him greatly regretting it (愛惜해 하는), say, "That's why they say there are no free things (공것이) in this world (世上)!"
★
There was a rumor (風聞) that Mr. Kim Ŏk (金億) had received thirty Wŏn (三十圓) as a token of gratitude (謝禮口文) for introducing the Samch'ŏlli Company's (三千里社) publication 『Peace and Freedom』 (平和와 自由) to a certain bookstore (某 書店). However, the other day (日前), Mr. Ŏk, the person concerned (當者), resolutely (■然) denied this, saying:
"Thirty Wŏn is a lie; that's very unfair talk. In reality (實上은), I received nothing but a sukiyaki (『스기야기』) treat (한턱)."
★
After advertising in the newspaper (新聞紙上) seeking the address (住所) of Pak Hyangmin (朴鄕民), the author (作者) of 'Today's Woman', which won first prize for drama (戱曲) in the Chungang Ilbo (中央日報) New Year Literary Contest (新年 文藝懸賞), a notification arrived the next day (翌日). Believing it to be genuine (그러려니 밋고 잇섯든 바), it was later unexpectedly (밧게) revealed (判明되야) that a fake (가짜) Pak Hyangmin, coveting (貪내여) the prize money, had sent a false (거짓) address. The authorities (當局者) were greatly shocked and turned pale (大驚失色), saying, "That was almost a huge problem (큰일날 번하엿다)!"

It was stated that among the thirty masterpiece novels (傑作小說) published (揭載된) in the Samch'ŏlli (三千里) New Year's issue (新年號), Yi Injik's (李人稙) work (作) 『Voice of the Ghost』 (鬼의 聲) was serialized in the Maeil Sinbo (每申). However, this was not the Maeil Sinbo; it seems the editor (編者), in their rush (총망중), mistakenly wrote that it had been serialized in the Manse[bo] (萬歲■). This is hereby corrected (爲之訂正).

Mr. Sŏk'yŏng, An Sŏkchu (夕影 安碩柱), recently drew three hundred watts (三百瓦) of his own blood (피) for a blood transfusion (輸血) when his recently sixty-year-old (?) (還充한) father-in-law (岳丈), Elder Kim Ilsŏn (金一善), was dying (殞命 時). At a time (이때) when even filial sons (孝子) who cut off their fingers (斷指) are rarely seen (볼업수는), the existence of a filial son-in-law (孝婿) who would even sacrifice his own blood for (■하야) his father-in-law cannot but be a rare occurrence (듬은 일이 아닐 수 업다) in recent times (近來에). However, it is quite regrettable (저윽이 哀惜한 일인) that even the sincerity (精誠) of this precious (貴여운) filial son-in-law did not achieve its effect (効를 엇지 못하고) and [the father-in-law] went the way he was destined to go (갈길로 도라간 것은). At the same time, friends and acquaintances (親知들은) are said to just admire (그저 ■■한다고) An's commendable filial act (갸륵한 ■■).<77>

**Summary**

This article compiles short news items and gossip concerning Korean literary figures in early 1935. It covers Sŏ Yŏnghae's publication of Korean folktales in Paris, Yi Kwangsu's radio lecture motivated by charity for an imprisoned friend, disputes between writers and a newspaper over rejected commissions, speculation about the real-life basis for Ch'oe Tok[...]’s new novel, Yi Sŏkhun's bittersweet prize win followed by costly illness, Kim Ŏk denying rumors of payment beyond a meal, an attempted prize fraud involving Pak Hyangmin, a correction regarding Yi Injik's serialization venue, and An Sŏkchu's filial act of donating blood to his dying father-in-law. From a historical perspective, the article offers glimpses into the precarious economic lives of colonial Korean writers (Yi Kwangsu needing lecture fees, Yi Sŏkhun's prize money overshadowed by medical costs, Kim Ŏk's rumored payment, the newspaper dispute), the perceived importance of maintaining dignity (體面) by institutions, the international presence of Korean culture (Sŏ Yŏnghae in Paris), anxieties about censorship or discontinuation of works touching sensitive subjects (Ch'oe's novel), and social values like filial piety (An Sŏkchu).
