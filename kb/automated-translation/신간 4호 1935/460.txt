**Summary**

This entry documents a play or scenario titled "Derailment" (脫線) by Pak Hyangmin (朴鄕民), published in the fourth issue of the magazine *Kaebyŏk* (開闢) on March 1, 1935. As the text of the play itself (pages 86-89) is noted as missing, its specific content, themes, and plot cannot be determined from the provided information. However, its publication in *Kaebyŏk*, a significant nationalist and intellectual magazine during the colonial period, suggests the play might have explored themes relevant to Korean society under Japanese rule, potentially touching upon social issues, modernization anxieties, or veiled critiques of the colonial situation, common subjects in literature of the era. Historians might find the metadata significant for tracking literary output in *Kaebyŏk* and the works of Pak Hyangmin, even without the text itself, contextualizing the cultural and intellectual climate of 1935 Korea.
