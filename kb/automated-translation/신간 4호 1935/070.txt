Newspaper Reporter's Confession
Newspaper Reporter's Confession of Repentance
Yi Sŏ-gu

A reporter's repentance.
For me, who spent ten full years working as a social affairs reporter in Chosŏn, a job full of incidents and feelings, it felt like receiving a sentence: "Settle the account of all the wrongs you have committed up to this day." I must have wronged many people unfairly, and told quite a few lies. Later, there was even a friend who asked,
"So, during your ten years as a social affairs reporter, how many affairs did you have?"
If I said,
"About ten or so,"
they would likely reply,
"That's surprisingly few."
If I said,
"If you count every woman whose love I enjoyed for that day in that room, just as they fell under my feet while I rushed about here and there, it would be at least two hundred,"
the questioner would immediately protest,
"Hey... Lies! Surely it couldn't have been that many."
Therefore, regarding the facts connected to the people I met and the things I experienced during my ten-year reporter's life, things that might cause repentance later on, I decided that the best policy was to keep them buried in secrecy. No matter how imposing the interrogation from Kaebyŏk magazine might be, I found I absolutely could not confess.

"Hey, I went to Chŏngjaok for lunch today, and guess who was there? That Cho OO from Chaedong. She came out of the restaurant happily with her husband and child, carrying the baby on her back. For some reason, I felt like a person who had committed a great sin and avoided her."
I have said something like this before. The woman named Cho was, of course, a female student who had become my plaything ten years ago when I was excitedly running rampant through the city. In the blink of an eye, ten years passed; she got married, and I grew old. Seeing her pitiful appearance, shrinking away in surprise upon seeing me, I felt I couldn't bear to inflict new pain related to past sins onto the heart of this woman who had become a wise mother and good wife living happily in her family. So, I deliberately avoided her.

In a place like Chosŏn, where society is not prosperous in any aspect, the only material for a social affairs reporter's confession that could possibly interest readers ends up being issues related to women.
"Telling unbearable lies when the Prime Minister changed, thereby clouding the readers' judgment to achieve temporary success," or
"Clenching fists and pounding the table in the bank president's reception room, <44> only managing to get a thousand won," or
"Learning a personal secret about a certain count's daughter and playing strange pranks," or
"Causing a large company to go bankrupt due to one careless stroke of one's pen"—
these are issues one might hear about in places like Tokyo or Osaka, but they are unlikely to happen here in Kyŏngsŏng. In the end, apart from money and power, nothing remains but matters concerning women. Since the conclusion has reached this point, pretending I can't help it, I feel compelled to confess the secret, a story from ten years ago, a deed more breathtaking than tightrope walking at a circus. I forget exactly when it was. However, it was when the Italian airplane first flew to Chosŏn, when Lieutenant Ferrarin came to Chosŏn. It was when the Tonga Ilbo even published an extra edition, turning Kyŏngsŏng upside down, announcing his landing at Yŏŭido. Since this hidden story lies within the pages of the Tonga Ilbo published then, astute readers might think carefully and realize, "Oh, it was that incident."
In the warehouse of the Tonga Ilbo building on Kwanghwamun street, built with three stories of glazed bricks, that extra edition probably still exists, bearing a tag that reads "Permanent Preservation."

The story becomes breathtaking from here. Mr. Song Chin-u, the current president, was also a top executive at the Tonga Ilbo back then. Reading this article, he might say,
"Eh—that wicked fellow! I told him then to be careful with women, yet he did such a shameless thing."
So, ultimately, if I were still at the Tonga Ilbo, the opportunity for this secret to be revealed to the world might have been further delayed. This means that while the life of someone wandering freely without ties might be twice as hungry, it is, shall I say, more manly.

Well then, how was the extra edition with the meaning
*Italian Lieutenant Ferrarin Arrives Safely in Kyŏngsŏng*
*Our Company Immediately Presented a Wreath*
published? The plane, expected to arrive during the day, was delayed in China, and each newspaper had prepared an extra edition, eagerly awaiting its arrival in Kyŏngsŏng. At that time, airplanes were under the jurisdiction of the Yongsan Army Command (as they mostly still are). The newspaper companies in Chosŏn, lacking complete communication networks in various regions, could only inquire about the airplane's movements by frantically calling the Army Command's adjutant office.
The plane, expected during the day, hadn't arrived even by evening. All the officers had left the adjutant office, and only one lieutenant on duty remained in the duty room. <45>
The only way for the newspaper companies, eager to publish an extra, to get news of the airplane was to rely on prompting this lieutenant.
The plan for the extra edition then was that as soon as a telegram from the Sinŭiju military police, stating the plane had passed Sinŭiju, reached the lieutenant on duty at the Army Command, they would immediately calculate the arrival time in Kyŏngsŏng and distribute about a hundred copies of the extra.
On this day, after finishing my outside assignments and returning to the office, I received a call from S, as usual.
"Let's go out somewhere."
"Where?"
"What time will you come out?"
Thinking the plane surely wouldn't be *that* late, I replied,
"Four o'clock."
"Where?"
"The corner by the Ingyŏngjŏn bell pavilion in Chongno."
"Okay, definitely?"
"Don't worry."
Having made this promise so readily with my lover, I waited for four o'clock. The time came, but the cursed plane didn't arrive, so how could I leave? The then-editor-in-chief, Yi Sang-hyŏp, called me over.
"Go to the Army Command duty room now and wait there. When the telegram confirming passage over Sinŭiju arrives, call the office immediately."
His command was absolute. Also, the fact that he chose me, a young man, for such a duty meant he had at least a thread of trust in me. Anyway, feeling honored, I couldn't utter a peep of protest.
"Yes, sir."
I answered almost crying out. I looked at the clock; four o'clock had already passed.
"The car is here,"
the office boy delivered the thunderous report to my ear. It was decided I had to go, and the car was waiting. It was no time for love, private rooms, or humming tunes.
Having no choice, I got into the car. And I made a grim resolve.
"Driver, please stop for a moment at the corner by the Ingyŏngjŏn bell pavilion in Chongno,"
I requested. The car stopped in front of Ingyŏngjŏn in less than five minutes. Like a delicate and graceful cosmos flower, she spotted the car I was in somehow and came running.
"A car today?"
She didn't know the situation and thought we were just going for a drive. Since I already had a guilty conscience and couldn't speak freely with the driver nearby, <46> I just said,
"Get in quickly."
The car passed through the main gate of the Army Command without issue.
"Where are we?"
Her question was not strange. Riding brazenly into the Army Command in broad daylight in a newspaper company car with a hidden lover—what kind of nerve was this?
"Anyway, don't say a word, just pretend to be a female reporter for the Tonga Ilbo. Just do as I tell you."
I finally confessed my predicament as a poor employee: I had received orders for an assignment at the Army Command, couldn't meet her at the promised time, and had no choice but to bring her here. Can there be weak soldiers under a brave general?
"Oh, how exciting! Yes, yes! I'll put on a straight face and pretend to be a female reporter."
At this point, we were undoubtedly a pair of delinquents. Without hesitation, we went up to the second floor, greeted the lieutenant on duty, and sat facing each other, waiting for the telegram. While doing so, calls from various newspaper companies came in like wildfire.
"Look, with all these calls, what if another newspaper reporter rushes over and our secret gets exposed?"
I wasn't free from that worry either. But I couldn't just send my lover away first, and if we left together, my neck would be on the line. If only I had been close to the duty lieutenant, I might have said,
"As a favor to save a life, we'll leave first. When the telegram from Sinŭiju comes, please just call the Tonga Ilbo office, ask for Yi Sŏ-gu's representative, and tell them the plane passed Sinŭiju." But I didn't have the nerve to ask, nor did it seem likely he would listen. While she and I were having this conversation, looking at the duty lieutenant's face and feeling anxious, the door burst open. A child about four or five years old entered first, followed by an officer's wife bringing dinner for her husband on duty. Seeing this, my eyes lit up.
"Look, since you're a woman, let's try to subtly get friendly with that lady. I'll play with the child."
Our operational plan was made instantly. In less than thirty minutes, S and the officer's wife were chatting quite amiably. They both put on such an act that, rather than us making the request, the lieutenant himself spoke first.
"It's a simple matter. As soon as the telegram confirming the plane's passage arrives, I will definitely call the Tonga Ilbo without fail, ensuring you're not behind others. Don't worry and go back."
This pronouncement, more sacred than the word of God, came down.
We rushed out from there, went to a quiet restaurant, had dinner, and were enjoying ourselves when <47>
"Extra! Extra!"
the shouts were heard. It was the Tonga Ilbo extra. It came out earlier than any other newspaper. Holding the extra, I said,
"Wow, thank goodness!"
Then, the witty S smiled faintly and said,
"Who knows if he did it for us, or if he just wanted to get rid of us so his family could have fun alone."
I followed up,
"Maybe so, but the fact that he made the reliable call—"
"Well, he's a soldier, would he go back on his word?" S pouted her lips again. -(The End)-

Newspaper Reporter's Record of Hardships
Hong Chong-in

It seems there's nothing particularly special to lay bare as the hardships of a newspaper reporter. In short, it's the struggle of human life. Why? Because when looking back on one's life, there must be at least some pleasant aspect to be able to speak of the traces of hardship with a smile. However, when I think about the profession I have stumbled into today, I don't feel unpleasant. There are many unpleasant things. I don't even feel the courage to write down a tale of hardships.
However, as requested by the Editor, I will try writing a few words to fulfill my responsibility.

Being a newspaper reporter is undoubtedly a somewhat difficult profession. Firstly, since newspapers cover all aspects of society and culture, the better a reporter's knowledge spans politics, society, economics, music, art, and everything else, the better reporter they can be. In other words, one must be extremely well-versed in common sense. But this "common sense" is the issue. In producing a newspaper that members of society should enjoy, the common sense needed to provide information skillfully must undoubtedly be the common sense ordinary people speak of, but it must be common sense that can be appropriately utilized in connection with the living issues of each day. On the one hand, a scholarly basis is necessary.
Throughout my newspaper reporter life to this day, the issue I constantly feel is lamenting the "lack of common sense" (沒常識). That is, things deviating from intellectual common sense, things deviating from established common sense—I have committed not just one or two acts lacking common sense. If possible, I want to possess accurate, abundant, and multifaceted common sense. And this is not limited to me personally. If I could wish for it, I would hope that the general public would also reconsider the meaning of being "common-sensical." Also, I wish newspapers themselves would become more common-sensical to further improve common sense.
However, comedies arising from various kinds of common sense about newspapers<48> are not non-existent. Everyone has their own impressions each time they see the newspaper they encounter morning and evening. This is especially true for the so-called intellectual class, and among young people, not a few harbor heroic desires to become great reporters or great newspapermen. Thus, while reading the newspaper, they unknowingly develop their own "views" on newspaper production. Though I don't know for sure, I believe there isn't anyone involved in newspapers today who hasn't held grand "ambitions" regarding newspaper production. I was like that too. But mistakes easily arise from there. That is, when one first becomes a newspaper reporter, one starts with great excitement, but in reality, even gathering news articles doesn't go well. By the time one is already half-baked, there are many mistakes and shortcomings. However, once an article they wrote is clearly printed in type on the pages that tens of thousands of readers will see, "reporters" feel a kind of great superiority. And regardless of whether it deviated somewhat from common sense or was insufficient, when they think that the vast majority of the tens of thousands of reader masses will read their writing with trust, or perhaps read it without noticing any errors or deficiencies in some corner, there are many cases where they develop an absurdly excessive confidence in their work. I believe this might be the path to the improper justification of erroneous common sense.
Newspapers make many mistakes. Readers should well understand that among them are many mistakes that should be generously excused. However, among the mistakes that certainly deserve punishment, I think the case mentioned before—where an inaccurate common-sense view is put into print, thereby making it seem like a valid perspective—is the most cautionary. When I think about my past, I feel I have done countless shameful things stemming from a lack of common sense, mistakes that cannot be washed away by regretting them just once or twice. I believe that accurate and abundant common sense only becomes solid through much experience. What I always think about is the lack of common sense.
×
The above are my usual thoughts, and likely not tales of hardship. So, I will try to tell an example of a hardship I faced in my duties as a newspaper reporter.
The hardship when facing a major incident ultimately comes down to how one's own brain works. In other words, figuring out where the crucial point of an issue lies, and what method to use to handle and expand upon that crucial point, is always considered a vital issue that determines the life of a newspaper reporter. I want to write down a short anecdote.
The swiftness of communication, maximizing the use of communication networks, can be quite <49> difficult. How effectively one utilizes communication and transportation agencies greatly influences gathering the most material in a short time and reporting it most effectively. Among these, telegraphic articles are one of the difficult types.
The pain I endured at the Yongjŏng village post office during the Kando Communist Riot incident a few years ago comes to mind as such an example. Last autumn, when I went on assignment during the Osaka flood disaster, it was unlike the Yongjŏng assignment.
That is, for the Yongjŏng assignment, although I departed the very night the incident occurred, it took a day and a half to reach Yongjŏng. If I entered Yongjŏng, gathered material there, and then communicated (by phone), it would be too slow. It could easily happen that my communication would be slower than other correspondents. If that happened, the meaning of being a special correspondent would vanish. Therefore, one of my hardships at the time was wondering if there was any way to secretly use communication facilities before entering Yongjŏng village. This meant investigating the Yongjŏng situation while traveling from Nanam through Hoeryŏng and via Sangsambong. Fortunately, I was able to grasp the general outline of the incident relatively accurately and could send a telegram from Sangsambong. What method did I use then? It would be fine to recount it here, but I am ashamed to expose my own clumsy strategy, so I will omit it. And then, when I entered Yongjŏng. I went to the post office, and official telegrams bound for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Government-General were piled up like mountains, making private telegrams completely out of the question. There was no choice but to make an urgent phone call. Amidst this, a post office employee showed great kindness, saying he would quickly handle it as an ordinary newspaper call. Although I communicated via ordinary newspaper call, it was extremely difficult. My pocket money for communication was running out, and communication wasn't going well. Where was the reputation of a so-called special correspondent?
When I went to Osaka, I truly couldn't figure out what to do for a moment. When I inquired in Fukuoka, I learned that telegraph and telephone lines between Osaka and Fukuoka were down. Seeing the example of the Osaka Mainichi flying manuscripts by airplane to issue an extra showed that the pain of communication was considerable. Even on the evening of the day I entered Osaka by plane again the morning after reaching Fukuoka, there were many places where intra-city phone lines were still down. Fortunately, they said the phone lines were barely working, and direct telegraph lines were also barely functional. However, when I rushed to the post office in the evening and asked about the status of telegraph and telephone lines, they said a delay of two or three hours, or even four or five hours, was not an issue. At the telegraph office counter, they said they couldn't guarantee the speed. Moreover, since it was a long newspaper telegram, it went without saying that it would be hopelessly delayed, no matter how urgent. At that time, while thinking if there wasn't a way to use extraordinary measures, it was an unexpected event that, through special convenience from a certain source, I was able to send <50> enough manuscript for a large extra edition within just two hours.
And all telegraphs and phone calls were urgent transmissions. The phone calls were three times the rate of one call at 2 won 90 chŏn, and telegrams were also three times the rate of 30 chŏn per message (50 characters). For telegrams, one Japanese 'kana' character was 1 rin 9 ri, so converting to Ŏnmun (Korean script) would estimate about 3 to 4 chŏn per character. On some nights, I made urgent calls for about 30 minutes each time, paying 80 or 90 won at once. Even after throwing away money like that, just getting hold of the telephone receiver was another considerable struggle.
Going this far, it's less about the hardships of a reporter's life and more about the capital warfare manifested in communication. (The End)

Female Reporter's Memoir
Ch'oe Ŭn-hŭi

Doing business, managing the household, raising children—all external and internal affairs of the home are shouldered entirely by me. It's difficult enough to handle the tasks that confront me daily, so how could I find the leisure for contemplation or summon the courage to open old book pages and take up writing? However, having been the first woman reporter to debut on the stage of the Chosŏn newspaper world, and having poured my heart and soul into it, whether well or poorly, for five fleeting years, I felt deeply moved upon receiving the request to write a memoir of my life as a newspaper reporter. Looking back, it was already twelve years ago, in the tenth month of the Kapcha year (1924). Amidst the competition among various companies during the golden age of newspapers, I was introduced as a kind of experimental specimen with a different color. Not only that, but at the time, wherever people gathered—at any banquet, on the street, or in the tram—they would point fingers, whisper, "That's the newspaper reporter," and even make strange noises demanding to see my face, forcing me to look back at them. Being treated as a curiosity amidst the thorns of mischievous youths and ruffians certainly presented considerable difficulties, but there was also much interest, vitality, joy, and hope. They say a newspaper reporter laughs with emperors and weeps with beggars. Moved by the psychology of the profession, I set sail on the waves of the world, observing countless matters with a newspaper eye, and the lively events are recalled again, piece by piece, as if new.
Now, as I sit with my eyes closed, I recall the Great Flood of the Ŭlchuk year (1925), which caused a stir as the first of its kind in history. Armed like a soldier heading to war, I went out into the torrential rain pouring down day and night, as if to sweep away the grounds of Seoul. Riding a raft in the downpour, making futile efforts for lives that couldn't be saved, staying at Wangsimni Station for nine days eating rice balls and sleeping fitfully; gathering all the various women's organizations in Kyŏngsŏng under the Chosŏn Ilbo flag, eventually even mobilizing courtesans (kisaeng) from various establishments (kwŏnbŏn) to cook rice and prepare side dishes; delivering clothes and medicine day after day—today to Ttuksŏm, tomorrow to Ich'on-dong, the next day to <51> Map'o Sokmak—traveling by boat (ppae-tto) in deep water and wading through shallow water (wŏlch'ŏn) to aid the disaster victims—all this comes back as vividly as if it happened yesterday. And when Korea's first newspaper reporter co-piloting event, which drew the entire capital's attention, was held at Yŏŭido, utilizing the homecoming flight of the head of the Chosŏn Flying Club, I, highlighted further by being a female reporter, received the enthusiastic cheers and blessings of 300,000 citizens. Leaving the majestic sound of the propeller on the ground, I peacefully became a person of the sky, broke through the clouds and mist, rose high to 300 meters, and looked down upon the vast city of Chang'an—that magnificent and boundless feeling also surges in my heart. At another time, I led a group of 500 members to Kisŏng net'ŏ P'yŏngyang for the Tano festival sightseeing, a major holiday in the northern Chosŏn region. After completing the city tour and other scheduled activities, during free time, I acted like a so-called heroine, taking one of P'yŏngyang's famous kisaeng ladies onto a boat. Singing "Eheyadeheya" and rowing, we circled Nŭngnado island once, when the boat capsized in the Taedong River wind, almost leading to an unintended double suicide (chŏngsa)—this amusing yet dangerous story also flashes before my eyes like a revolving lantern (chumadŭng). The incident where I believe I played the most rewarding role as a newspaper reporter—the ○○○○ Incident. In the dead of night, around ○ o'clock AM, holding my breath and treading softly, I secretly infiltrated the police station undetected by rats or birds. Like an actor in a moving picture, I slipped through the tight security cordon here and there, called a taxi, pursued the police officer's car, and through desperate efforts, finally uncovered the truth of the incident. I woke up Editor-in-Chief Min T'ae-wŏn, who was lost in a dreamlike state, sent rickshaws for social affairs ace Pak P'ar-yang and several others, made emergency calls to other related personnel, and issued an urgent extra edition. By then, the clock showed half past two AM. The bewildered state of the rival newspapers, who knew nothing until then, made me feel triumphant like a victorious general. That night, returning after watching a show at the Chosŏn Theater, the sight of two cars parked in front of the Chongno Police Station prompted me to roll my eyes and check the atmosphere inside the station. The full mobilization of the stern-faced High-Section gentlemen struck me as suspicious. Acting on a hunch proved so fruitful. Recalling it even now gives me goosebumps—it was thrillingly flavorful and satisfying. I apologize now for the discourtesy of freely using the Posindang Clock Shop at the corner entering Imun-gol, which served as one of my temporary operational bases back then, without explaining the situation or obtaining permission. Among all these memories, let me try to select and write down the major strands from the tangled threads that arise. The story reverses back to the time I joined the company. When Mr. Yi Kwang-su (pen name Ch'unwŏn) approached me about joining the company, I thought a newspaper company was a very respectable, dignified, sincere, and praiseworthy place where scholarly gentlemen gathered, sat around orderly and quietly, just writing articles and doing research—something like a university research lab. Being a young outsider fresh from school, lacking social knowledge, and having thought newspapers, aside from novels, had nothing to do with <52> me and never reading them, it was perhaps understandable to think that way. Around ten AM, following Mr. Min T'ae-wŏn (pen name Ubo), who has now departed on the eternal road to the netherworld from which he cannot return, I took my first step inside the Chosŏn Ilbo office amidst various fantasies and aspirations. It was before the social affairs reporters had gone out, so the atmosphere inside the editorial department wasn't too far off from my expectations. Soon, after noon, young fellows started gathering one by one, two by two, and the room became boisterously noisy, seemingly ready to fly away with the cigarette smoke. Their boastful stories, miscellaneous chatter, laughter, and coughing sounds all mixed together, suddenly unfolding an extraordinary world I had never imagined. Like a baby bird caught in a sudden shower, I lost my presence and huddled in a corner. What still remains a vivid impression is Mr. Yi Sŏ-gu, gallant, frank, yet playful, immediately teasing me, "Calling you 'auntie' seems too young, calling you 'older sister' might be inappropriate, how should I address you?" He always insisted on having me pick up the phone even if it was within his easy reach, and would offer me a lit cigarette only to say, "Oh dear, you might get angry, let's not," and bow apologetically, saying, "I retract the offer." Because I looked too shy and kept my lips tightly sealed, I even heard that one reporter from the economics department worriedly asked, "Where did they pick up such a demure lady?"
The first way I became known to the world as a newspaper reporter was through the disguised investigative reporter series, which for a while became the focus of interest for Chosŏn Ilbo readers, a topic of conversation in every household, and later almost became a nationwide trend. Readers probably remember. The first operative was a roasted chestnut seller, the second a rickshaw puller, the third a Russian bread seller. The fourth operative, being a woman, was me. To experience the bitter sorrow of the *haengnang ŏmŏm* (female servant living in the outer quarters), who receives the most contemptible treatment in our households, I obtained ragged clothes reeking of grime enough to make one nauseous on the spot, put on filthy, soot-black socks like a chimney-sweeping broom, applied black makeup with ink to my face and hands, carried pickled radish greens, strapped a baby to my back, and started from Yaju-gae. Passing the Yukcho Street, circling Chŏndong and Sadong, crossing the main Chongno area to Kwansu Bridge, and then heading towards the Chosŏn Ilbo office in Sup'yo-dong along the stream bank—navigating through dangerous zones at every turn, where countless enemies stood guard like sentinels, slinking past like a mouse passing a cat's den. Especially at the night market, crowded with people, mingling with mischievous scholarship students who held cutout newspaper photos of the disguised reporters and tried to strike up conversations, wondering if it was really me—the sweat dripping down my spine is unforgettable even now. Also unforgettable is entering the brightly lit Chosŏn Theater looking like that, deliberately sitting right next to a kisaeng lady, and being scolded loudly, "Who is this? You're wrinkling my clothes, move away!" That memory is especially clear. As I write this, looking at the *haengnang ŏmŏm* who just came in to clean the house, she seems to perfectly embody my appearance back then. Gazing at her for a while, <53> feeling immense sympathy for her pitiful life, I am also endlessly grateful even now for the kindness of Ms. Hŏ Yŏng-suk and Ms. Kil Chŏng-hŭi, who were the masterminds behind this disguise.
Thus, my first article was published in the newspaper, and from then on, I gradually learned methods and skills for taking action. Rather than being a writer (記者, kija), I lived the life of an activist (動者, tongja), compensating for my lack of a powerful pen with strong legs. Also, every spring and autumn for one or two months, I organized women's study tours. For housewives bound by household chores who rarely got to see the outside world, it served as both an outing and a way to broaden their knowledge. We visited places directly related to our practical lives, like banks, post offices, hospitals, and tram departments. We saw how their beloved silk fabrics are woven, how the tap water and electric lights we use daily come to us, the mechanical devices for telegraph and telephone, and radio broadcasting. At the South Manchuria Railway Company factory, we witnessed astonishing scientific advancements: huge logs instantaneously sliced like dried pollack shreds, iron blocks cut like tofu or radish; machines hung in the air, lifting even locomotives and traversing the factory inside and out like an *obigut'ong* (overhead crane?). We provided practical study tours. We visited the Secret Garden (秘苑, Piwŏn), where emperors and empresses used to stroll. Though now it's a sorrowful palace endlessly decaying, soaked by dreary spring rains and winter snows, it was once a place of imposing authority. It was originally the home of Prince Chŏn'gye, King Ch'ŏlchong's biological father, then passed into the hands of Hŭngsŏn Taewŏn'gun, King Kojong's biological father. He discarded the old system and rebuilt it magnificently in the eighth month of the Kyŏngjin year (1870). Later, it became the place where the emperor held the crown prince's wedding ceremony. It was the detached palace where His Majesty King Yi (later Emperor Sunjong), who passed away on the 14th day of the third month of the Pyŏngin year (1866) (lunar calendar), married Empress Sunmyŏng. Guiding visitors there—where palace ladies (尚宮, sanggung), once glamorous enough to hold ranks equivalent to female ministers and receive stipends from twelve ministries, and court ladies (宮女, kungnyŏ), who moved their graceful steps to the sounds of banquets under flowery mornings and moonlit nights, now live out their remaining years as helpless, old, frail bodies shedding endless tears in this house that matched their fate. We also visited Kyŏngbok Palace's Kunjŏngjŏn Hall, rebuilt with the power of Taewŏn'gun, the hero of his time who grasped Chosŏn in his hand overnight from a state of shabby robes and worn hats. Who would have thought that this structure, built with an authority so fearsome he earned the nickname Qin Shi Huang, would, merely seventy years later, see its former glory vanish without a trace, becoming ruins overgrown with wild weeds?
-(Following three lines regrettably omitted)-
Other sites requiring vast expenses, like the 6.5 million won Government-General building, Kyŏngsŏng City Hall, Kyŏngsŏng Station, etc., are too numerous to list individually, but we carefully selected those deemed necessary to see at least once and conducted tours. In spring, we viewed the peach blossoms of Kaesŏng; in autumn, the crimson maples of Soyosan Mountain. We held Women's Chestnut Gathering events in Yangju and Anyang, famous for chestnuts, allowing participants to spend a pleasant day—these are also interesting memories. Writing these things down<54> is not to boast of them as great achievements, but how can I stop the memories that naturally float in and out of my head when I reminisce about the past?
As I bring up poignant palace affairs, another related memory comes to mind: the passing of Emperor Sunjong, the final emperor of the peninsula's 500-year dynasty. After a turbulent and deeply felt life of 53 years (actual count), he left behind twenty million people in white mourning clothes and departed for eternal rest (濱天, pinch'ŏn). The cries of the populace, reaching the heavens, were tears mourning the departed king, and the sobbing sounds of sorrow, erupting in various forms, seemed endless. In front of the grief-clouded Tonhwa Gate, hundreds of women, old and young, -(one line omitted)- dashed their delicate, weak bodies against the hard ground, crying out his name—this scene, too, is among the unforgettable events experienced during my life as a newspaper reporter. -(Following three lines regrettably omitted)-
The former Chosŏn Girls' Schools United Bazaar—this is the most profound event in my past life and will also be unforgettable in the future. Thirteen schools, or perhaps twelve, daughters of Chosŏn raised in the south and north, four thousand students rolling eight thousand eyes and moving forty thousand fingers, beautifully weaving and embroidering tens of thousands of handicrafts—cultural, artistic, and practical items like embroidery, knitting, and sewing, purely the crystallization of skill and effort—were gathered in one hall. Tens of thousands of visitors, pouring in like the tide, marveled at the brilliant display. Piled-up goods sold out before their names could even be checked. This grand event, truly a great success among successes, was repeated year after year. As the bazaar items spread one by one into our homes, they alleviated the time and effort spent washing, starching, and sewing uneconomical Chosŏn clothes. Moreover, they helped improve the clothing for growing children—who sprout daily like cucumbers or eggplants—making them convenient, free, hygienic, and visually appealing. Even placing just one framed picture, one artificial flower, or one lampshade cover in a monotonous Chosŏn home breaks the monotony and makes the room pleasingly harmonious. How great are the benefits this bazaar brought to Chosŏn homes! It was likely a method tens of times easier and faster than shouting for lifestyle improvement orally or in writing. Lifestyle improvement must first start in the minds of housewives. Since they came, saw plenty with their own eyes, bought items, took them home, and tried using them, lifestyle improvement naturally began through that process. Therefore, I considered this "Bazaar" my own project and threw myself into it with all my body, mind, strength, and sincerity, truly forgetting to eat in my fervor. Unlike other events, preparing for this took a lot of time and demanded money and effort, so <55> some schools avoided participating. Therefore, as the organizer, I spent months negotiating with various girls' schools in southern and northern Chosŏn. I met with teachers from schools in Kyŏngsŏng, discussing how to supplement points lacking from the previous year, improve luxurious aspects towards practicality, and create new items demanded by the public, striving in every way to make this event beneficial, bring happiness, and herald the dawn of cultural life for the people of Chosŏn. Thus, I organized it four times myself, and not once was it anything but a great success. Not once did I face difficulty disposing of leftover items; they sold like hotcakes. This can be called the reward for the sacrifices made by those young students, mixing their blood and sweat. Their social contribution was significant even during their school days. Sitting and working with their eyes and hands, they engaged in cultural movements and lifestyle improvement movements—how beautiful, lovely, and precious is that? Therefore, knowing this was a major undertaking for generations, my running around staying up all night was truly not a futile effort. Now, that season has returned. Since this bazaar was always held as the lunar year-end approached, writing this article precisely at this time fills my heart with countless wandering thoughts that have no end. Furthermore, hearing that some schools facing financial difficulties supplemented their winter expenses with the income from this bazaar, the direct and indirect contributions of this event are indeed not small. It is a great loss and regret for us that this practical and interesting "Bazaar" is not held recently. It feels like I'm subtly boasting only about myself, for which I feel endlessly sorry to the readers, but what can I do when facts are facts? I turned the compass of my activities this way and that. As accomplished women in Chosŏn increased steadily, I felt it was an immense waste that their grand ambitions and practical experiences were not published but left buried. I realized it was also my mission to exchange and synthesize their good opinions and convey them to the public. Thus, I invited various accomplished women to one place and held a "Symposium on Household Issues." Since this was also a first in Chosŏn, the participants that day, as well as the readers, found considerable interest and practical benefit. Moreover, the topics were housing, clothing, food, marriage, childcare, etc., the most urgent and relevant issues for Chosŏn at the time. As doctors, educators, social leaders, and individuals who had considerably studied various fields of academics and arts gathered, every point raised during the debates and discussions was a gem, gold for us all. Some magazine reviewed this symposium, calling it "improvisational poetry," but looking closely, every single word and phrase stemmed from thoughts held and experiences gained over time, and was preparatory knowledge intended to brighten the future of Chosŏn households—I want to reiterate this. Once this symposium was published, various newspapers and magazines followed suit, starting to hold roundtable discussions or symposia, and now it can be said that it has almost passed through a "season" of popularity. As the records of this symposium were published in the New Year's issue, recalling this event today, just twenty days past the New Year, makes the scene feel even fresher <56>.
If a woman went to the licensed quarters (遊廓, yugwak), anyone hearing it for the first time would assume she had a mental disorder or was a sexual deviant. But the reality is a marketplace of human flesh (人肉, innyuk), where scenes of human ugliness and the stench of rotting, blood-stained life are tangled together—born as the same human beings, yet some sell flesh and others buy it. Visiting this human hell, this frightening and gruesome scene, and using a sharp pen to quickly launch a movement to abolish licensed prostitution (公唱廢止運動, kongch'ang p'yeji undong)—if that could be achieved, the reward would truly be great. Regardless of the outcome, it is a fact that I did go to the licensed quarters. I had visited the Yoshiwara district during my studies in Tokyo after hearing lectures on the issue of licensed prostitution, but this time I sought out the Taegu licensed quarters, rumored to be the dirtiest among them. It was August, the day of the Mid-Autumn Festival (Ch'usŏk). The sky was high, the wind clear, and the moon bright—a day when mind and spirit felt refreshed together. This special district was filled with a gloomy atmosphere. There was no etiquette, personality, shame, or anything—only lewd men seeking human flesh and the desperate tactics of women putting on airs to sell their flesh well. I won't record the inside story of exploring this den of demons here, but hearing the undisguised laments of those clinging to their cursed youth, something that we women could absolutely not experience even with the same amount of money—shall I call it a benefit of becoming a newspaper reporter? In complete contrast, I also visited a convent (修道院, sudowŏn) at that time, where nuns spend their days solely with hymns and scriptures for the sake of future bliss, having burned away all the vain glory of the world and all human pleasures. Let me try to conjure up the ghastly fantasy of the human flesh market from the lingering waves of that striking impression, and end here. -(The End)-

The Sorrow of a Newspaper Reporter
So Sŏng Hanin

One: The Sorrow of a Newspaper Reporter
In the modern era, the newspaper business is also a corporate entity, an institution subordinate to capital conglomerates. As such, newspapers inevitably become commodities, and being commodities, they cannot help but prioritize profit. Consequently, a newspaper reporter is nothing more than an employee, merely a tool for capitalists. Therefore, being a newspaper reporter is also a kind of profession, decidedly not deserving the prestigious titles excessively praised in the past, like "uncrowned emperor" or "white-headed emperor." They are simply employees attached to an enterprise, merely workers selling their labor in the production department. However, people often exaggerate the newspaper business, praising it as the "voice of the people" or a "sacrificial cultural enterprise," and correspondingly revere the newspapermen involved as "uncrowned emperors." Caught up in this, the reporters themselves are misled by this overestimation, acting as if they are authoritative figures of a special kind guiding and leading the general public <57>. They fall into delusions of grandeur, truly imagining they belong to a distinct class, separate individuals, once they start working for a newspaper company.
However, if you think about the reality, they are employees engaged in the most miserable profession. They belong to the group of people most pointed at and treated with avoidance by society. A newspaper reporter is a strange person living a kind of "mole" life, constantly examining the dark side of the world or the inner hidden aspects of people, exposing them, and digging them up. Therefore, although outwardly it seems like a most free profession, the most unfortunate and pitiful job is that of a newspaper reporter. Unaware of this, novice reporters, once they set foot in a newspaper company, act as if they have passed through the dragon gate (登龍門, tŭngnyongmun - gate to success) and run wild, ruining their lives.
This is a general dissection of the newspaper reporter profession itself. While this applies to external relations, delving into the life *within* the newspaper company is the core of the topic. So, I intend to move to the main subject, but before that, I must state, as mentioned earlier, that since the newspaper is an enterprise and merely a plaything of capital conglomerates, the severity of labor-capital relations surpasses even that of profit-oriented organizations or companies focused solely on profit. Simultaneously, the life within the company for newspaper reporters, who are subordinate employees, harbors miserable sorrows that outsiders cannot possibly glimpse.

Two: The Reporter's Grievances Towards Management
When we say "newspaper reporter," it usually refers to people belonging to the newspaper company's editorial department, engaged in reporting (social affairs desk), foreign news (political desk), domestic news (local desk), economy, arts and culture, proofreading, etc. However, the public tends to apply the title "reporter" to anyone working at a newspaper company. The internal structure of a newspaper company is divided into editorial, business, and printing departments. "Reporter" refers to a portion belonging to the editorial department; those in the business and printing departments are not reporters but company employees. Regardless of this distinction, within the newspaper company, there are executives (幹部, kanbu), quasi-executives (準幹部, chun'ganbu - assistant editors, chief editors, department heads, etc.), followed by those with connections, namely old-timers (舊參者, kuch'amja), and then the newcomers (新出, sinch'ul - all called ordinary reporters, 平記者, p'yŏnggija). Under the department heads (部長, pujang), who are responsible for each department, are the old-timers, followed by the ordinary reporters, each with vastly different ranks. Those belonging to the executive level, the so-called capitalists or entrepreneurs, belong to a privileged class, as seen in other companies. Their power is truly sacrosanct and inviolable. If they engage in tyranny, they are truly unstoppable. Externally, they only need to curry favor with the direct supervisory government office, and that's enough; everyone else is beneath their notice, especially profit-making companies, which they regard as their "rice bowl." Internally, the people bearing the title of "reporter" are treated worse than employees in other corporate enterprises, despite receiving salaries of several tens of won per month. Regardless of the length of working hours, the stability <58> or instability of life, the severity or lack thereof of being driven and ordered about, the exploitation of their labor is entirely arbitrary. Yet, if they show even the slightest resistance to the executive-level figures or protest the unfairness of a reason, it's treated as if a major incident has occurred. That reporter is attacked more severely than a "traitor" and immediately dismissed. One word from an executive demands absolute obedience for a reporter to keep their job. If they utter even one word about right or wrong, that person must be prepared to bid farewell to the company at that very moment. In other societies, dismissal comes with a grace period to seek other employment, but at a newspaper company, it's an instantaneous order of cutting ties in two. For this reason, while newspaper reporters receive the most honorific titles (?) externally, internally they are treated more contemptuously than food delivery men. Thus, naturally, to survive long as a newspaper reporter, one must show absolute obedience to the executive class belonging to the newspaper enterprise. Taking it a step further, to escape the status of an ordinary reporter and achieve a decent position or gain fame as a noted reporter, one must curry favor with the executives, even becoming their stooge (병정, pyŏngjŏng), flatter them, and become their informant (끄나풀, kkŭnap'ul). There must be at least several dozen private house visits daily and dozens of "favors" (요공, yogong) per year to win their favor, and one must pay off their debts of solicitude. A recent example is the case of a clever person who obtained the position of a so-called "lightning department head" (벼락部長, pyŏrakpujang) at a certain newspaper company. Rising through the ranks in one go, securing a pivotal (?) position within just a few months, his influence within the company rivals that of the "Propaganda Minister," Goebbels, under German President Hitler. This serves as proof. Technical skill, efficiency, suitability of disposition, adequacy of qualifications—these are secondary and tertiary conditions. The primary condition for obtaining that prominent position is the quantity of "favors" rendered and the skill in pleasing the superiors (補脾胃, popiwi - lit. supplementing the spleen and stomach). This might be too harsh a statement, but to grasp the most crucial path to position and advancement, one must become an informant for the person with the highest authority, namely the one providing the funds, or if not, at least play the role of a stooge's stooge for the person enjoying their sole love and trust, to ensure longevity. That is, if one cannot shrewdly attach oneself to the direct faction of the top executive (excluding robots), no matter what efficiency, skill, or disposition one possesses, they are destined to be eternally unlucky children, mere employees whose reward is small compared to their effort, eventually having their heads roll one morning or evening due to a slight misstep. This situation can also be seen in the example of a certain newspaper company from a previous year. Overnight, more than ten people were dismissed (馘首, kwŏksu - lit. beheaded) without a moment's grace period or a penny of severance pay. How pitiful a scene, what precarious lives they led?—.

Three: The Rampancy of Factions, Cliques, and Cronyism
Chosŏn has historically been plagued by factionalism (偏色, p'yŏnsaek) and party strife (黨爭, tangjaeng), turning into a kaleidoscope. Even now, regional fervor (地方熱, chibangnyŏl), clan cliques (班閥, panbal), and party colors (黨色, tangsaek) have brought it to the brink. Yet, newspapers loudly proclaim the need to break this down, writing editorials condemning it, presenting themselves as transcending such factionalism and party cliques with imposing arguments spanning thousands of characters. However, looking at the reality within <59>, the very nest of factionalism and party cliques is the newspaper company. The entire structure is disguised by personal connections (情實, chŏngsil) and factionalism (派閥, p'aebal). Regional fervor can be seen here, and factional cliques and cronyism (我黨, adang - lit. my party) can be found here. Northwesterners gather Northwesterners, Honam people form panels of Honam people, and Kiho people prioritize Kiho people. Yet, even this lacks a fixed standard. It solely depends on the close associates of the manager, or rather, the people trusted by the individual who holds the sole trust of the manager. In other words, the faction holding power within the company gets to pick and choose all personnel. In a newspaper company where the editor-in-chief holds sway, the majority of reporters are drawn from his network. If the business director holds power, only those who joined through his network can strut about within the company. Also, the president, vice president, chief writer, assistant editor, and others—all have countless different factions within the company, secretly vying to establish power, looking intently for opportunities. Eventually, everyone ends up belonging to the most powerful faction among them. In the past, at a certain company, the suggestion that since the editor-in-chief was Noron (Old Doctrine faction), the business director should be Soron (Young Doctrine faction), became a topic of conversation for a while and earned general ridicule. But now, it's not simply about factional classification based on historical parties; the main objective is establishing power through cronyism. When a certain faction gains power, that faction attempts to dominate freely. When that faction falls from grace, the next faction in line tries to raise its head and emerge. Thus, a silent struggle continues, and even amidst outward smiles and laughter, hidden strife persists. A prime example is a certain company currently where a faction led by a certain director, the confidant of the owner, holds power. A few individuals who flatteringly joined this faction sway the general trend, and employees not belonging to their faction, regardless of being in business, editorial, or printing, have mostly faced ruin. The assistant editor, rather than the editor-in-chief, controls and influences the editorial department. Those outside his circle are all in a precarious position. Even someone who joined just days ago, if belonging to that group, receives treatment and benefits far superior to long-time employees. A department head, relying on the influence of the XX director, acts arrogantly, etc. Truly, a chaotic state of affairs, head-to-tail disorder (首尾頭倒, sumidudo), prevails. Furthermore, another company, like XX, has established a kingdom of XX director's dictatorship, where other departments, as if subordinate to the business department, cannot even squeak. When cronyism reaches this level, it can only be seen as having reached its extreme. Looking at it this way, one can see how contradictory their proclaimed principles are compared to their inner workings, how much they are wearing masks. Therefore, reporters placed in such circles inevitably endure various hardships and icy, burning days, forced to swallow their tears and accept the daily driving and toil. If they harbor dissatisfaction, they must make a swift decision to leave. If they reveal even a little discontent or try to argue right from wrong there, their heads will roll off without knowing which ghost took them.

Four: Excessive Exploitation of Labor
Until recently, newspaper companies were thought of as something like ideological groups or political organizations. Initially acting like vanguards of the masses, <60> even when facing poverty, they outwardly pretended to be perfectly content ("serene warriors," 武士泰平, musat'aep'yŏng) and put on airs of "rinsing the mouth after drinking cold water" (i.e., pretending to be full when hungry). Thus, even when unpaid for months, even dozens of months, they steadfastly worked for the sake of the newspaper, or rather, to keep a certain kind of institution alive, selling off all household goods and borrowing money while faithfully performing their duties at the company. This psychology became ingrained in the minds of managers, who skillfully exploited this mentality and cleverly captured the reporters' desire for fame and privilege associated with the profession, thereby excessively exploiting their labor and whipping their hardships as much as possible. If a for-profit company had dared to act this way, labor-capital disputes would have numbered in the hundreds and thousands. Previously, executives at a certain company frequented high-class restaurants (料亭, yochŏng) every month, spending thousands of won, kept mistresses, and lived luxurious lives, yet left employee salaries unpaid for dozens of months. They ignored the miserable state of the employees' lives and focused only on filling their own desires, never reflecting on their actions. Even now, rumors suggest that at a certain company, employee salaries are meager, only two-thirds or even half of those at other companies. While claiming extreme frugality in everything, their top priority seems to be the company building (社屋, saok)? They throw tens of thousands of gold (金, kŭm) to construct a magnificent company building. Or, certain executives are said to have started mining ventures, used company funds to build personal residences, or built houses for others as compensation for giving away promised company chairs. Meanwhile, employee salaries are so excessively low compared to their effort that they can barely maintain appearances. They seem perfectly content putting out a newspaper largely using newly hired trainee reporters on "cheap monthly salaries" (야스月給, yasu wŏlgŭp - likely from Japanese 'yasui' meaning cheap). Is this not truly making fools of the public and excessively exploiting the employees' labor? What else could it be? Reaching this point, I cannot help but feel a chill in my heart and cannot restrain my sympathy for the employees of that company. In any case, when it comes to labor exploitation, newspaper company executives are likely the foremost authorities. However, if such things occurred in other for-profit companies or other capital conglomerates, they would write extensive articles, seemingly defending the workers' side, condemning the illegality without the slightest mercy. Indeed, if one were to criticize this as the detestable behavior of those who "pat their back while stroking their belly" (打背撫腹者流, t'abemubokcharyu - hypocrites), what defense could they possibly offer?

Five: Conclusion
Writing about the inner life of newspaper reporters unexpectedly turned into harsh criticism (嶮口, hŏmgu) of the executives. However, be that as it may, the life of a newspaper reporter is one of disadvantage both externally and internally. Internally, it's like treading on thin ice, passing each day in constant fear and trembling. On one hand, one must be faithful to liaison duties, and on the other, one must please the executives. Sometimes, one must even use smooth talk and pleasing manners (巧言令色, kyŏŏnnyŏngsaek) to win their favor. Furthermore, one must also read the moods of the direct lineage of the dominant faction. What a bitter life, what miserable human beings they are! The inner life of reporters engaged in the so-called cultural profession, reporters who are supposed to be models (師表, sabyo) for the masses <61>, is thus full of contradictions and irrationality. Knowing this, who would want to set foot in a newspaper company? (Though there might be companies that are not like this). I ask, among the reporters currently employed in Chosŏn, could anyone possibly deny this with a "no"? Anyone who denies it must either belong to the category benefiting from the executives' protection or else be an incompetent imbecile, a stark naked fool—I assert this definitively.

Memoir of a First-Generation Reporter
Chŏng U-t'aek

Perhaps it's inappropriate phrasing, but upon receiving the command from my esteemed friend Mr. Cha—like being hit with a pestle out of the blue, as the saying goes—to write a memoir of my reporter life, I suddenly couldn't grasp the thread of past experiences and truly struggled, before deciding abruptly to write whatever came to mind, whether it makes sense or not. Back in the old Korean Empire era, starting from the time of Mr. Yi Chong-il's *Cheguk Sinmun* (Imperial News) and Mr. Namgung Ŏk's *Hwangsŏng Sinmun* (Capital Gazette), I first developed an interest in newspapers. I submitted articles daily, and regardless of wind, cold, heat, or humidity, I eagerly spent the spare change in my pocket on reading subscriptions. Later, I began to know Mr. Yang Ki-t'ak of the *Taehan Maeil Sinbo* (Korea Daily News) office. I maintained close contact with Mr. Pak Ŭn-sik, who was the editor-in-chief and lead writer at the time, and received fifteen won each month as an investigative reporter, barely managing my responsibilities with my clumsy skills. Then, as the world changed unpredictably, the shadow of the *Taehan Maeil Sinbo* vanished somewhere, and the current *Maeil Sinbo* became its successor, striving for society alongside the *Keijō Nippō* (Kyŏngsŏng Daily News) from a few thatched-roof rooms in Taiwa-chō (大和町, Taehwajŏng/Yamato-machi). At that time, I was living as a masterless man (浪人, nangin/rōnin), supporting my family with a meager inheritance. Fortunately, invited by Mr. Nakamura Kentarō (中村健太郞), I entered the Maeil Sinbo office for the first time in my life and began the regular path of a reporter's life. Though I lacked trained skills, I managed to act like a major reporter using my wits. Looking back now, I might deserve criticism as a shameless person, but still, as a young reporter, my qualifications were respectable. On the first day at the company, clutching my pounding heart, I finished greeting everyone face-to-face. Then, Editor-in-Chief Pyŏn Il ordered me to write for the Readers' Club section. At that time, Mr. Yi Sang-hyŏp (pen name Hamong) had joined a few months before me, and Mr. Cho Chung-hang (pen name Ilche) was doing outside reporting and writing novels. Since the Readers' Club was my specialty, I wrote about a page's worth (한단 가량, handan karyang) and submitted it. After some time, seeing it typeset, printed, and coming through proofreading filled me with such wonder and curiosity. The next day, I began visiting various police stations and courts in the city daily to gather material. Around that time, if you brought back material on theft, deaths of travelers, or lost children, it wouldn't become a special feature, but it might get published as a second-tier article (二號一段, iho ildan) with a headline after the editor-in-chief's selection. How could I obtain material good enough to be considered a top-tier article (一號二段, ilho idan)? This single thought preoccupied me so much that even my dreams were disturbed. Moreover, there was <62> a competitor: Mr. Cha, a reporter for the Korean language supplement of the *Chōsen Shinbun* (朝鮮新聞). An unspoken, unconscious rivalry for scoops arose between us. Many social affairs articles were snatched by Mr. Cha, leading me to receive tearful rebukes from Editorial Supervisor Mr. Matsuo (松尾). Devising a plan, I started presenting theater invitation tickets like offerings under his nose (코아렛 進上, k'oaret chinsang - 'under the nose tribute', likely meaning directly giving bribes/favors) and begging like a daily supplicant. Not long after starting this, my performance improved remarkably, and I began to act like a proper reporter.
×××
One time, it was New Year's Day, January 1st by the solar calendar. When I arrived at the office as the very first person, Mr. Matsuo said, "There's just been a fire at Ch'angdŏk Palace. We urgently need to make an extra edition. Take a rickshaw, rush over, investigate from beginning to end, but be especially careful as it concerns the Imperial Household." It was my first assignment (첫 번 盃盤, ch'ŏt pŏn paeban - lit. first cup and tray, idiom for first task/experience). Flustered, I reached the front gate of Ch'angdŏk Palace but dared not enter, just loitering nearby. Japanese reporters walked briskly with tense faces, busy scribbling in their notebooks, but I stood like an outsider watching someone else's business. Firstly, the rickshaw puller felt unbearably embarrassed. The thought of returning to the office like a blind mute made my chest tighten, and my nerves felt paralyzed; I was at death's door. Fortunately, I caught Department Head Kim Tŏk-hong, whom I knew well, coming out after the fire was extinguished. I questioned him from start to finish, but amidst the hustle, I couldn't get the essential details, only managing to grasp the outline. Returning to the office immediately and picking up the pen, I found my memory failing (先忘後失, sŏnmanghusil - forgetting before and losing after). The number of wasted manuscript pages reached nearly, no surprise, fifty or sixty. Forcing myself like Ch'unhyang (억지춘향이 格, ŏkchi Ch'unhyangi kyŏk - idiom for doing something unwillingly), I put out the extra. Afterward, my chest felt relieved, but on the other hand, I was utterly exhausted (氣盡脈盡, kijinmaekchin). I belatedly realized that while the newspaper reporter's life could be easy at times, it could also be incredibly difficult.
Through the long passage of 365 days a year, how often did I venture out unpredictably, sleeplessly pursuing wondrous story material? Right! A strange rumor emerged from the heart of Kyŏngsŏng city. What was it? In my several years as a reporter, this was the most bizarre, unheard-of special scoop I had ever obtained. I couldn't even think about eating; I jumped for joy.
★ Bride of Three Days Suddenly Turns into Poisonous Woman, Attempts to Strangle Groom ★
Going down towards the stream south of Paedari (present-day Chu-gyo-dong) in the city, there was a shabby thatched house midway. The son of that house (17 years old) was engaged to a young lady from a farming family in Tongch'on Katpatch'i. The wedding proceeded with all six rites (六禮, yungnye), and she came to the groom's house for the customary three-day stay. Marriage is a great human event, a joyous occasion sealing a lifelong partnership. Congratulations from relatives and neighbors poured down like hail, and auspicious clouds (瑞雲, sŏun) hovered between the two families. It was around the time of the Mid-Autumn Festival in the eighth lunar month. The clear moonlight, like glass, shone mercilessly into the bridal chamber where sweet newlywed dreams were to be dreamt. The rustling sound, occasionally shaking the leaves, <63> was already enough to evoke the sorrow of autumn on a certain early evening. The bride, a year older than the groom, was extremely gentle and mature, adept at handling all matters without hesitation. However, the groom, regardless of age, had been raised with boundless love by his parents and rarely ventured beyond the main gate. More than just being called a simpleton (맹추, maengch'u), he was utterly blind to the ways of the world. Thanks to his parents, he managed to get married, but he was also clueless about physiological matters, a complete blockhead (숙맥, sungmaek). The cunning bride, with just one sideways glance, grasped all the groom's good and bad points. At the very start of their marriage, tears welled up, soaking the collar of her dress, and she began lamenting her fate.
"My father and mother raised me well. Even if not a rich family, they should have found me someone I could live with for a hundred years. But they married me off to such a blockhead. How can I wash away this deep-seated resentment?"
Sighing deeply enough to make the earth sink, again and again, she lowered her eyes and pondered deeply. During the first few days of marriage, it's said that if people don't peek through holes in the door of the bridal chamber, ghosts will spy instead. Whether due to this Chosŏn tradition or being bound by stubborn superstition, the women of the house, each vying with excitement, quietly poked holes in the papered window, plastered firmly with mulberry paper (大戶紙, taehŏji), giggling and peeking inside. Meanwhile, the full moon that had illuminated the whole world tilted towards the western sky. A chilly dawn wind shook the window frame, evoking the feeling of early winter. It was probably well past three AM, but the candle flame in the bride's room burned even brighter. The air in the room, devoid even of breathing sounds, felt truly desolate. Like a cat stalking a mouse, they remained facing each other, holding their ground. The household members, filled with suspicion and unease, could only exchange anxious glances. Though it was past midnight, the fact that the bride and groom stayed awake all night with eyes open drew everyone's attention even more. The groom, growing secretly impatient, mustered all his courage, approached the bride, tried to remove her clothes, and lay her down. But she resisted fiercely, determined to fight to the death. What could he do? Helplessly, he passed the night like that, and somehow the day dawned. No matter how much of a naive simpleton he was, the return of night was more hateful to him than anything else.
On the night of the third day.
The bride, who had stubbornly resisted day after day as if refusing to see him, now feigned obedience to the groom's wishes. What could be her purpose? All sounds were hushed (萬籟俱寂, mallwae kujŏk); the whole world was silent as a dead mouse. The elders in the main room were likely deep in slumber, drowsy in the late night. From somewhere, the exquisite, clear melody of the Yangsando song drifted out, then changed to the style of Susimga, a lament filled with sighs and tears, striking the ear melancholically. The singer of this song was the bride, married just three days. Gazing intently at the figure of the groom sleeping and snoring in a corner of the warmer part of the floor (아랫목, araenmok), she lamented her fate. Meanwhile, she grew increasingly agitated (上氣, sanggi - flushed/excited). Her eyes filled with murderous intent, pupils dilated upwards. Trembling, she crept closer and closer to the groom, intending to commit a terrifying act. She stealthily picked up the groom's untied belt lying nearby. After practicing with her own hands several times, she finally, overcome by a sudden burst of malice, began to strangle the groom's neck. But as she dared to do something she had never even heard of before, her hands and feet trembled, her nerves stretched to the absolute limit. Suppressing her pounding heart, she tried hard to strangle him. However, even for this wicked woman committing a bold act, her strong force gradually weakened. As she strangled with all her might, the startled groom woke up. Terrified, he called for his mother in the next room and ran out stark naked. This caused a commotion in the dead of night. The poisonous woman's explanation was cleverly fabricated: she claimed she had a nightmare while sleeping soundly and screamed as she ran out. However, the innocent groom's lips did not conceal anything; he confessed everything he knew about the events of the three nights. Thus, the next day, the bride's family was summoned. In those unsophisticated times—this happened about twenty-five years ago from now—they simply sent the bride away, and the matter was settled without further incident. But for such an event to occur in the heart of Kyŏngsŏng was truly rare."
Hearing this rumor and investigating thoroughly in all directions, I eventually learned that the bride had a lover (姦夫, kanbu) with braided hair (辮髮聞秀, pyŏnbal munsu - possibly meaning a literate man with Manchu-style queue?), and they had made a secret pact like this upon being forced to part. For the first time, treating it like a romance, I serialized the true story for several days. It captured the readers' curiosity, and newspaper subscriptions surged, creating a boom for a while. Im Sŏng-gu's Hyŏksindan troupe dramatized the factual strange tale, performed it for a week, gained considerable profit, and attracted immense interest from the public.
Perhaps because I was young, I rarely needed to write in a notebook. A quick glance, like viewing scenery from a galloping horse (走馬看山, chumasansan), was enough for my memory to remain fresh for life, without forgetfulness (健忘症, kŏnmangjŭng). When writing secretly, I often did it hidden inside my turumagi (Korean traditional overcoat), fulfilling my duties. Though it sounds like boasting, people in the world, upon seeing me, used to call me the reporter who writes well hidden inside his turumagi.
★ A Choking Incident While Wearing Chosŏn Clothes in Pusan ★
Having worked for so long, I gradually rose through the ranks, and this happened during my time as Local Affairs Department Head.
His Majesty King Yi, residing in Tokyo, was visiting Chosŏn for the first time in several years on an official tour. Consequently, officials and citizens throughout Chosŏn made a great fuss preparing to welcome him. From the press corps, Mr. Nozaki Shinzō (野崎眞三 - currently Social Affairs Department Head at Chōsen Shinbun), a reporter from the Kyŏngsŏng Ilbo Social Affairs Department, and myself from the Maeil Sinbo side, were dispatched as special correspondents to Pusan, boarding the night train at Kyŏngsŏng Station. I must mention beforehand <65> that not only had I never worn Western clothes (洋服, yangbok) in my life, but I also lacked the courage to even try them on. My daily attire remained unchanged: Chosŏn clothes with a turumagi. Being a newspaper reporter who didn't fit the mold, anyone meeting me for the first time couldn't help but be astonished. Furthermore, having never traveled even ten ri (about 4 km) away from home, the thousand-ri journey to Pusan felt overwhelmingly vast. Moreover, being completely ignorant (熟麥, sungmaek) about travel procedures, my heart just pounded. However, having received orders from the company president, I went to Nammun Station empty-handed. The train was just about to depart, but luckily I met the aforementioned Mr. Nozaki and boarded the same car. This brought some relief, but taking a sleeper car was beyond my wildest dreams, so I hadn't applied in advance. Naturally, I didn't have a name tag. After much trouble, thanks to the train attendant (車中專務令監, ch'ajung chŏnmu ryŏnggam), I managed to buy a lower berth. Being tall, playing the role of an unnatural hunchback made sleep impossible. I worried about losing sight of Mr. Nozaki, my advisor figure, when day broke. After suffering greatly, dawn finally arrived (於焉東方旣白, ŏŏn tongbang kibaek). As I tried to get out, my shoes were nowhere to be found (不知去處, pujigŏch'ŏ). Startled, I searched everywhere, only to find it was due to the kind attendant boy polishing them. Pusan Station was guarded like an iron fortress (鐵瓮城, ch'ŏrongjŏng) inside and out. Passing through the extremely strict security cordon—(five characters omitted)—I was the only one [in Korean clothes]. Thanks to being a reporter, I passed the inspection checkpoint without being singled out and emerged onto the pier. Soon, the ferry arrived. Everywhere was crowded with people welcoming the arrival. It was announced there would be an official and public reception, so the group of reporters all headed to the reception room on the ship. Pitifully, I, unable to wear Western clothes, just wandered aimlessly near the pier, looking like someone diligently performing some kind of guard duty. On one hand, I felt ashamed, and on the other, indignant, feeling I had lost my qualification as Local Affairs Department Head. The way people in Chosŏn clothes were treated with such deference (敬讓, kyŏngyang - likely sarcastic, meaning avoidance/discrimination) made me keenly feel the necessity of Western clothes from that moment on. But that feeling, too, lasted only for that moment.
Well, realizing I had made the troublesome train journey for nothing filled me with incomparable indignation. Although I managed to get a seat in the car behind the one His Majesty boarded, the car carrying the reporter group, that car too was filled with only (four characters omitted) [Western clothes], except for me. When the attendant took lunch orders in advance, he bowed deeply before the gentlemen in fine Western suits, taking orders sequentially. When he finally reached my turn, he glanced at me once, then silently turned and walked away. Before my anger could subside, I suffered another great humiliation. Driven by hunger, I had no choice but to awkwardly find the dining car and purchase a meager lunch for one won fifty chŏn. After filling my empty stomach (赤口充腸, chŏkku ch'ungjang), I returned to my seat. The car was filled with lively chatter and laughter, blossoming with conversation, but no one seemed inclined to interact with me. Feeling utterly isolated (無聯, muryŏn), I spent the thousand-ri journey to Pusan meditating (坐禪, chwasŏn), returning to Kyŏngsŏng without realizing it. The mistreatment (虐待, haktae) of Chosŏn clothes was truly excessive. As a blockhead who failed to fulfill the duties of the Local Affairs Department Head, I couldn't suppress my self-reproach. After that, I firmly resolved never to travel by train wearing Chosŏn clothes ever again. Haha, great laughter.
★ Story of Saving a Family with a Single Pen ★
Among my decades as a newspaper reporter, I intend to write down the most satisfying and flavorful incident. <66>
One summer night, just before the last of the three hottest periods (末伏, malbok), I was passing near Kwangmudae Theater in Hwanggeum-jŏng (黃金町, Hwanggŭmjŏng/Kogane-machi), Kyŏngsŏng. On the northern sidewalk, a household seemed to have set up camp. Finding it highly unusual, I approached and saw what could be called living under the open sky (幕天席地, makch'ŏnsŏkchi). Thin branches served as posts at the four corners, and tattered skirt fragments formed earthen walls, enclosing the space. Inside, a family huddled together, just looking at each other's faces. Even without asking, it was clear they were homeless, with nowhere else to go, forced into this outdoor life. It seems the poorer people are, the more blessed they are with children; the couple had five offspring. The eldest was fourteen, and the others followed at intervals of two or three years. The head of the household was then in his late forties or early fifties, while his wife was a young woman of only thirty-three. Judging by their appearance and attire, they didn't seem like completely low-class, ignorant people.
How must that man have felt, sitting blankly with his young family on a major roadside where people constantly passed? His desolate and tragic state of mind must have been beyond words. Mischievous young people deliberately peered in, adding useless worries, but he lacked even the strength to respond infinitely. Moreover, he was too embarrassed (낫치 따거워서, nach'i ttagŏwŏsŏ - lit. face burning) to lift his head.
At that moment, as a newspaper reporter, I couldn't help but feel sympathy for his plight, ■■■■■■■■. Before hearing the details, an impulse of pity moved me, and I kindly asked about his circumstances from beginning to end.
"Originally born in Kyŏngsŏng, I lived comfortably, but as the family fortune gradually declined, we moved to Ch'ŏngju County in Kyŏnggi Province, where we had some farmland (田庄마직이, chŏnjangmajigi). Getting used to farming life, I developed quite an interest in agriculture. However, it wasn't enough to feed the entire family (糊口, hoku). Due to debts here and there, the crops harvested through a year of blood and sweat only fattened the bellies of those snake-like debt collectors (債鬼, ch'aegwi) and tyrannical landlords (地主, chiju). What remained amounted to just a few bundles of rice stalks, making it difficult to survive day to day (朝夕難繼, chosŏngnangye). We reached a point where we couldn't even have a spoonful of watery gruel (우거지 粥, ugŏji chuk). How could we sustain even our mayfly-like lives? Selling off belongings one by one, like silkworms eating mulberry leaves (稍蠶食之, chojam sikchi), we eventually had nothing left. Unable to live there anymore, we took our young wife and children and tearfully set foot towards Seoul. No one called us or asked us to come, but seeking a way to live (活路, hwalno), our family of seven, wandering on the edge of death (死線, sasŏn), managed to find a room in the outer quarters (行廊, haengnang) of a house near Ch'o-dong (present-day Im-jŏng/Hayashi-chō). We finally had a place to settle our bottoms (궁둥이는 奠接되엇으니, kungdung'inŭn chŏnjŏptoeŏssŭni - found a place to sit/stay), but the thought of how to make ends meet (입에 풀칠할, ibe p'ulch'irhal - lit. paste lips) day by day was vague. Our family of seven was on the verge of becoming corpses. My body, soft-boned (軟骨, yŏn'gol), had never known or even seen labor. Every morning at dawn, tucking a packed lunch (변또, pyŏntto - bento) of poorly cooked coarse rice under my arm, I rushed off to what was called a workplace. Spending the whole day digging earth on the street—like the so-called 'earth digger' (땅패기, ttangp'aegi)—it seems there's nothing in the world as difficult and tiring as digging earth. When the sun tilted towards the western sky, marking the end of the workday, <67> I received a wage (債金, ch'aegŭm - likely meant 'wage' 賃金, imgŭm, but used debt character) of merely thirty-five chŏn. Returning home, my clueless children would cheer, 'Father brought money!' Seeing them jump happily, rather than feeling the pain like my heart was bursting, hot tears streamed down. My poor wife often wept aloud with me.
If I were to recount the tearful hardships of the past few years, the thread would still be unraveled, so I'll keep it brief. But adding insult to injury (雪上加霜格, sŏlsanggasanggyŏk), the unwelcome delivery date was fast approaching. With nothing to eat, the cries of children asking for food—how suffocating must it have been for me, their father? Ah, a bolt from the blue (靑天의 霹靂, ch'ŏngch'ŏnŭi pyŏngnyŏk) struck! Because the lady of the main house was due to give birth (順産, sunsan) around the same time, an expulsion order (逐出令, ch'ukch'ullyŏng) was issued, citing the rule that two births absolutely cannot happen simultaneously in one house. We begged for a few days' grace, but they insisted we leave immediately. What could we do (奈何, naeha)? We had no choice but to be driven out to here. We starved this morning too and are exhausted, about to die. What's even more pitiful is the situation of my wife, whose due date (臨月, imwŏl) is near."
He sobbed, choked with emotion. Hearing this, I thought, Chosŏn is supposed to be a land of human feeling (人情나라, injŏngnara); how could they heartlessly kick them out? I couldn't help but be shocked by their cruelty. Emptying my pocket, I gave him one won (一金壹圓也, ilgŭm ilwŏn ya) and offered heartfelt consolation. I suddenly made a decision. The next day, upon arriving at the office, before anything else, I would appeal their pitiful situation to society. Even obtaining a penny of sympathy money to help these struggling people wouldn't be a futile effort. With that thought, I wrote for a week in large, bold characters, vividly depicting their tragic and desperate situation. Starting the very next day, sympathy donations began pouring in. Within three days, a large sum of 300 won—money soaked in tears—arrived. How happy and glad I felt! I immediately went to find them, relayed the news, and first secured a room (방한간, panghan'gan) with a deposit (傳世, chŏnse) to give the homeless family a place to stay. Then, I prepared a full섬 (sŏm - traditional unit) of rice and a cartload of firewood. The remaining money was deposited in a bank, to be withdrawn when needed. From that fund, we ensured provisions for the wife's impending childbirth. Using that as seed money (큰미천, k'ŭnmich'ŏn), I helped them start a roasted chestnut business on the street. More than their own happiness, the listeners expressed endless gratitude towards society.
This became the crystallization of a chance encounter. To this day, they haven't forgotten righteousness (義, ŭi) and affection (情, chŏng), visiting me more faithfully than relatives. I am sincerely grateful for their loyalty. Hearing that the family, revived from death, made that their sole foundation (財團, chaedan) and now get by without skipping meals (朝飯夕粥, chobansŏkchuk - lit. morning rice, evening gruel), I feel an overwhelming sense of gratitude, and tears just flow freely. This is the most impressive and deeply felt episode from my life as a newspaper reporter. <68>

**Summary**

These four articles from the March 1935 issue of "Kaebyŏk Sin'gan" offer varied recollections from Korean newspaper reporters working under Japanese colonial rule. Yi Sŏ-gu humorously confesses to moral compromises, particularly regarding women, necessitated by the job's pressures and the limited scope for impactful journalism in Kyŏngsŏng compared to Japan. Hong Chong-in reflects on the intellectual demands and "lack of common sense" plaguing the profession, detailing the intense logistical and financial challenges of reporting major events like the Kando Incident and the Osaka floods. Ch'oe Ŭn-hŭi, Chosŏn's first female reporter, provides a vibrant account of her active role, from covering floods and participating in pioneering flights to organizing large-scale women's bazaars and conducting undercover investigations, highlighting both the excitement and the unique difficulties faced as a woman in the field. So Sŏng Hanin delivers a scathing critique of the newspaper industry itself, exposing the harsh realities of reporters as exploited employees subject to the whims of capitalist owners, rampant internal factionalism based on regionalism and personal connections, and the hypocrisy of newspapers condemning societal ills while perpetuating similar injustices internally. Chŏng U-t'aek, a veteran reporter, shares anecdotes from the early days of Korean journalism (around the 1910s), including covering a palace fire, reporting a sensational crime story, and facing discrimination while traveling in Korean clothes, illustrating the evolution and persistent challenges of the profession.

Collectively, these memoirs provide valuable first-hand insights into the nascent Korean press during a tumultuous period. Historians can find rich material here on the social conditions of colonial Kyŏngsŏng, the ethical tightrope reporters walked, the practical difficulties of newsgathering with limited infrastructure and under censorship, the surprising agency and contributions of early female journalists, and the stark power dynamics and internal politics within Korean-run enterprises operating under Japanese oversight. The articles reveal the reporters' complex blend of professional pride, cynicism, disillusionment, and occasional triumphs in documenting and sometimes influencing their society.

新聞記者 告白書
新聞記者 懺悔錄
李瑞求
긔자의 뉘우침.
만 십년 동안 일만코 늑김 만코 조선의 사회부 긔자 노릇을 한 나에게는 맛치
「너의 오늘까지 싸흔 잘못을 청산해 노아라」는 선고나 듯는 것 갓햇습니다. 남의 억울한 것도 만이 햇스랴니 거즛말도 퍽은 하엿스랴니 나종에 가서는
「그래 십년 동안 사회부 긔자 노릇을 하는 동안에 외입은 얼마나 햇나」
뭇는 친구도 잇섯습니다.
「한 십여 명은 되지」
하면
「그것은 의외로 적은데」 할 것이요.
「이곳 저곳으로 뛰어 다니는 길거리에서 발길에 걸니는 대로 그 날 그 방안의 사랑을 즐긴 녀자를 모조리 수에 너흐면, 적어도 이백명은 될 것일세」
하면, 뭇는 사람은 그 당장에
「엣기... 거즛말 설마하니 그러케 만핫슬나고」
항의가 드러올 것이니까 내가 십년 동안의 긔자 생애에 맛나본 사람 당하야 본 일에 연결되여 이러한 후일에 뉘처질만한 사실은 비밀에서 비밀에 파무더 두는 것을 제일 상책으로 작정이 되엿는지라 아모리 긔세 놉흔 개벽사의 심문일지라도 도저히 자백할 수는 없게 된 것이다.
「여보게 오날 정자옥에 점심을 사먹으러 드러 갓드니 저- 재동사는 趙OO이가 왓데 그려. 아해를 업펴 가지고 남편과 세 식구가 자미잇게 식당에서 나오겟지. 나는 왼일인지 큰 죄나 지은 사람가티 피하여 바렷네」
이가튼 말을 한 일이 잇섯다. 趙라는 녀자는 이제로부터 십년전 내가 한참 신이 나서 시내로 횡행할 때에 나의 노리개가 되엇든 녀학생인 것은 물론이다. 어느 틈에 십년이 지나 그도 시집을 가고 나도 늙어 버렷다. 그는 나를 보고 놀내서 옴츠러지는 그의 애처로운 모양 행복한 가정의 현모량처가 되야 자미잇게 사는 그의 가슴에 옛날에 지은 죄에 대한 새로운 아픔을 참아 못주겟다는 생각이 드러서 내가 스사로 몸을 피해 바린 것이다.
조선가티 모-든 사회가 풍성풍성치 못한 곳에서는 사회 부긔자의 참회의 재료로 가히 독자에게 흥미를 줄 것은 녀자에 관한 문제로 끗이 난 것이다.
「총리 대신이 갈니든 때에 참아 못할 거즛말을 하야 독자의 현명을 흐리게 하야 일시의 공을 세웟섯다든지」
「은행 총재의 응접실에서 주먹을 부르쥐고 아단을 처서＜44＞ 겨우 천원 밧게 못 어더 썻다든지」
「어느 백작의 령양의 일신상의 비밀을 아러가지고 신기한 작난을 해보앗다든지」
「자긔가 붓대 한번 잘못 놀닌 탓으로 큰 회사가 파산을 하엿다든지」
이가튼 문제는 동경이나 대판가튼 곳에서나 드러볼 일이지 우리 경성에서는 잇기 어려운 일이니까 결국은 돈과 권세를 떠나서 녀성에 대한 일 밧게는 남지를 안는다는 것이다. 결론이 여긔에 이르럿스니 못 익이는 체하고 십년전 옛 이야기 삼아 아슬아슬하기 곡마단에서 줄타기보다 더 기막힌 짓을 한 비밀을 자백하지 안코는 못견대이게 되고 마럿다. 때는 어느 때인지 이젓다. 그러나 이태리 비행긔가 조선에 처음 날너 올 때 페라린 중위가 조선에 온다. 여의도에 착륙을 한다고 동아일보에서는 호외까지 발행하야 경성천지를 뒤집은 일이 잇든 그때 발행한 동아일보 지면에 숨은 비화이니까 잘 생각하시면 현명하신 독자는 오- 그때의 일이엇고나 하실지도 모릅니다.
삼층 사기벽돌노 싸인 광화문통 동아일보사 창고에는 아직까지도 「영구보존」이라는 패가 달려 그때의 그 호외가 그저 잇슬 것이다.
이야기는 여긔서부터 긔가 맥혀진다. 지금 사장 송진우씨가 그때에도 동아일보의 최고 간부이엇스니 이 긔사를 읽다가
「에-이 고약한 놈 게집을 상가라고 그때 그러케 일넛것만 그런 뻔뻔스러운 짓을 하엿고나」
하실지도 모릅니다.
그러니까 결국은 내가 아직가지 동아일보에 잇섯드면 이 비밀은 또다시 세상에 발표될 긔회가 연장되엇슬지도 모르겟다는 말슴입니다. 그러니까 매인데 업시 뽐내고 다니는 팔자가 배는 곱흘지 모르나 사나이 답기는 하다 말슴입니다.
자-그러면 그때의 호외에
伊國 페라린 飛行中尉 京城에 安着
本社에서는 卽時 花環을 寄贈햇다.
이가튼 의미의 호외는 엇더케 발행되엇든가. 그날 낫에 도착하리라는 비행긔가 중국에서 지체가 되야 각 신문은 호외를 준비해 놋코 경성에 오기만 고대하엿다. 그때의 비행긔는 룡산 군사령부에서 관할(지금도 대부분 그럿치만)을 할 때이다. 각지에 통신긔관을 완전이 갖지 못한 조선의 각 신문사에서는 오직 군사령부 부관실에 불이 나도록 전화로 비행긔의 동정을 무를 뿐이엇다.
낫에 온다는 비행긔가 저녁때가 되도록 오지를 안어 군사령부 부관실에는 장교라고는 하나도 없이 다- 사퇴를 하고 숙직 중위 한 분이 숙직실에 남어 잇슬 뿐이엇다.＜45＞
신문사에서 호외를 내랴는 비행긔의 소식은 오직 이 중위를 충동하야 듯는 외에는 다른 도리가 업섯다.
그때의 호외내일 게획은 비행긔가 신의주를 지냇다는 신의주 헌병대의 전보가 군사령부 숙직 중위에게 이르면 그 즉시로 경성에 도착을 시간을 헤아려 호외를 백여바릴 작정이엇든 것이다.
이날 나의 외근을 맛치고 사에 드러가니 S에게서 전례에 의하야 전화가 왓다.
「어듸로 놀러 갑시다」
「네 시에」
「몃시에 나오시랴오」
나는 설마 비행긔가 그러케 느질 줄은 몰낫스니까
「네 시에」
대답을 해버렷다.
「어듸서」
「종로 인경전 모퉁이」
「그러면 꼭」
「걱정 마시요」
이러케 선선스럽게 애인과 약속을 해놋코 나서 네 시 되기만 기다리자 시간은 닥처 왓스나 원수의 비행긔가 오지를 안흐니 나아갈 수가 잇서야죠. 당시의 편즙국장 리상협씨는 나를 부르드니
「지금부터 군사령부 숙직실에 나아가 잇다가 신의주 통과햇다는 전보가 오거든 즉시 사로 전화를 거시요」
그의 명령은 절대적이다. 또 그리고 이가튼 직책이나마 나를 뽑아서 식히는 것도 나라는 젊은것에게 실낫가튼 신임이라도 잇스니까 그런 것이다. 엇잿든 황송하야 깩소리 하나 못하고
「네」
우다십히 대답을 하엿다. 시게를 보니 네 시는 벌서 지냇다.
「자동차 왓습니다」
급사는 나의 귀에 벽력가튼 보고를 한다. 가기로 작정이 되고 자동차까지 대령되엿스니 사랑이고 안방이고 코ㅅ 노래를 부를 시절은 안이다.
나는 하는 수 없이 자동차에 올낫다. 그리고 나는 비장한 결심을 햇다.
「운전수 종로 인경전 모퉁이에 잠간 세워 주시요」
부탁을 하엿다. 차는 오분이 다 못되여 인경전 압헤 섯다. 코스모쓰가티 간열피고 청초한 그는 어느 틈에 내가 탄 자동차를 발견하고 쪼처왓다.
「오늘은 자동차요」
그는 속 모르고 가치 「드라이부」나 하는 줄 안다. 나는 임의 가°심한 일이 잇서 자동차 운전수가 거릿끼여 말도 시원이＜46＞ 못하게 되니까 엇잿든
「어서 타시요」
하엿슬 뿐이다. 차는 군사령부 정문을 무사 통과하엿다.
「여긔가 어대요」
무는 것도 괴이치 안은 일이다. 백주에 신문사 자동차를 버틔고 감추어 둔 애¸을 당당이 실고 군사령부로 드러가다니 대관절 엇지할 뱃심이냐.
「엇잿든지 두말말고 동아일보 부인긔자인 체만 하면 고만이니 내가 식히는 대로만 하시요」
나는 비로소 군사령부에 출장 명령이 나려 약속한 시간에 맛나지 못하게 되니까 하는 수없이 여긔까지 실고 왓다는 기막힌 피고용자의 고통을 하소연햇다. 용감한 장수 아래 약한 군사가 잇슬가 보냐.
「아이고 자미잇네 그래 그래 내 시침이 뚝떼고 부인긔자인체 하리다」
이러케 되면 두말할 것업시 한쌍 불량남녀이다. 이층으로 서슴치 안코 두리 올나가 숙직 중위에게 인사를 한 후 두리 마조 안저서 전보 오기만 기다린다. 이리하는 동안에 각 신문사에서 전화가 불이 낫케 온다.
「여보 저러케 전화들을 하다가 다른 신문긔자가 달녀와서 우리의 비밀이 발각이 되면 엇더커우」
나 역시 그 걱정이 업는게 안이다. 그러나 애인만 먼저 보낼 수 업고 가티 가자니 목이 다라날 것이다. 숙직 중위나 친해 두엇드면
「사람 하나 살려주는 세음치고 우리는 먼저 갈 것이니 신의주에서 전보만 오거든 동아일보사로 리서구 대리라고 하고 비행긔가 신의주를 통과 햇다고 한 마듸만 해 달나고」 하렷만은 무슨 염치에 그럴 수도 업고 드러줄 성 십지도 안타. 그와 나와는 이가튼 소리를 하고 숙직 중위의 관상을 하고 불안이 잇스랴니 문이 왈칵 열니며 사오세된 어린이 하나가 압흘 서고 뒤로는 장교 부인이 숙직하는 남편의 저녁을 가지고 드러슨다. 이것을 보고 고만 눈이 번하야
「여보 당신은 녀자이니 저 부인을 살며시 친해 봅시다. 나는 저 어린애를 놀닐 터이니」
두 사람의 작전계획은 즉시 되여 삼십분이 다 못가서 S와 장교 부인과는 여간 자미잇게 이야기를 하지 안햇다. 엇더케도 둘이 능청을 떨엇든지 이 편에서 청을 하기커녕 그 장교가 먼저 입으로
「간단한 일이니, 비행긔가 통과 햇다는 전보만 오면 반드시 남에게 뒤지지 안케 동아일보로 전화를 분명이 거러줄 것이니 걱정 말고 도라가라」
는 하느님의 말슴보다도 더 거룩한 처분이 나렷다.
우리는 그 길로 뛰어 나아와 어느 조용한 음식점에 가서 저녁을 먹고 자미잇게 노는 판에＜47＞
「호외, 호외」
소리는 낫다. 동아일보 호외이다. 어느 신문보다도 가장 일즉이 호외는 나왓다. 나는 호외를 들고
「참, 고맙지!」
하엿드니, 꾀쟁이 S는 뱅긋 우스며
「우리를 위해서 그랫는지 우리를 내쫏고 저이 식구만 자미잇게 놀랴고 그랫는지 누가 아우」
하얏다. 나도 따라서
「따는 그래 그럿치만 신용잇는 전화를 거러 준 것은-」
「그야 군인인데 일구이언을 할나구」 S는 또 다시 입을 쫑긋하엿다. -(끗)-

新聞記者 苦心錄
洪鍾仁
하필 신문기자의 苦心談이라고 눌어 노을 것도 별로 업슬 듯 십다. 말하자면 사람의 생활고일 것이다. 왜 그러냐하면 자기생활을 돌아볼 때에 적어도 유쾌한 일면이 잇서야 고심의 자최도 미소 속에 말할 수 잇을 것이다. 그러나 오늘 내가 발버온 금일의 직업을 생각하면 불유쾌히 안다. 불쾌한 것이 만타. 구태여 苦心談을 적을 만한 용기도 안 난다.
그러나 編輯 先生의 청하시는 대로 두어 마데 책임 맥이로 써볼까 한다.

신문기자는 다소 힘든 직업임은 틀림업다. 우선 사회 문물 百般을 게재하는 것이 신문임으로 신문기자라면 될 수만 잇다는 정치도 사회도 경제도 음악도 미술도 무엇에나 널리 지식을 가릴 수 잇을사록 조흔 기자가 될 수 잇다. 말하자면 가장 상식적이어야 한다. 그런데 이 상식이라는 것이 문제이다. 사회인이 즐겨해야 할 신문을 제작함에 요령잇게 제공될 상식이 이것도 보통인의 말하는 상식임은 틀림업스나 그날 그날의 산 문제와 연락하여 適宜히 활용할 수 잇는 상식이어야 한다. 일면으로는 학문적 근거가 필요 되는 것이다.
나는 오늘까지의 신문기자 생활에 평소 늣기는 문제로 『沒常識』을 한탄하고 잇다. 즉 지식상 상식상에 버서나는 일, 制別상식에 버서나는 일 등 몰상식한 일을 감행한 것은 한 두 가지가 안이다. 될 수 잇다면 상식을 정확히 또 풍부히 다각적으로 가지고 십다. 그러고 이것은 내 개인에 한한 것이 안이라. 만일 요망할 수 잇다면 일반 사회인도 상식적이란 의미를 재음미하엿으면 한다. 또 신문들도 좀더 상식의 향상을 위하여 좀더 상식적이엇으면 한다.
그런데 신문에 대한 상식에 여러 가지로 발생되는 희극이＜48＞ 이 不無하다. 每日朝夕으로 接하는 新聞을 볼마다, 平素의 所感을 가지는 것은 各人各稱으로 누구나 가릴수 잇는 것이다. 所謂識者階級에 가서는 더구나 그러하고 靑年들 中에는 英雄的 心理에서 大記者, 大新聞人이 되고십다는 希望을 가지고 잇는것도 적지안타, 그래서 그들은 新聞을 接하는 동안에 어느듯, 新聞製作에 對한 『一家見』지 가지게된다 몰으기는 하거니와 오늘 新聞에 關係가진 어느 누구를 勿論하고 新聞製作에 對하여 遠大한 『抱負』를 안가젓든이가 업슬줄안다. 亦是나도 그러햇다. 그런데 거기에서 잘못이 생기기쉽다. 卽新聞記者가 처음될에 크게 興奮을 가지고 出發은 햇으나 事實에 잇서서는 記事取材하나 변변히 되는것이안이다. 그러는 동안 임이 설닉엇을에는 錯誤되는일 不足한 일이 만타, 그러나 한번 自己가 쓴 記事가 數萬讀者가볼 紙上에 렷이 活字化할에 『記者』들은 一種의 큰 優越感을가진다. 그러고 多少常識을버섯낫던 不足햇던가를 莫論하고 活字化한 自己의 글을 數萬記者 大衆이 大多數가 信任을가지고 읽어주겟거니 는 어느구석의 잘못이나 不足을 몰라보고 읽어주갯거니 하고 생각할 自己의 일에 對하여 엉터리업시 過大한 自信을 가지게되는 例가만타, 이것이 卽 錯誤常識의 不正當한 正當化의 經路일한다.
新聞이 잘못되는 일은만타 其中에는 寬大히 客怒하여야할 잘못이 만흠은 讀者들도 잘 諒解해야 할것으다 그러나 其中에는 罰하여야 할 잘못이 勿論만흔中에도 前記와가튼 一例 不正確한 當識的 見解를 活字化함으로써 一家然케되는 境遇가 가장 警戒할바이라고 생각한다 내 過去를 생각할에도 沒常識에서나온 북그러운 일을 얼마나만히햇는가 한두번이나 後悔해서는 씻지못할 잘못이 적지 안음을 늑긴다 亦是正確하고 豊富한 常識은 만흔 經驗에서 비로소 堅實해진다고 생각된다 恒常생각하는 것은 常識의 不足이다.
×
以上은 平素 생각하는 바이고 苦心談은 안일하야 다시 新聞記者로써 事務上 當하든 苦心의 一例를 말해볼한다.
重大한 事件을 當하엿을 때 苦心이라고한 것은 結局은 自己의 頭腦의 活動如何를 말하게되는데 말하자면 一問題의 重點이어데잇는가 一, 問題의 重點을 어 方法으로 料理하여 擴大식히느냐하는 것이 어느나 新聞記者의 生命을 決定하는 重要問題에 屬한다고 생각한다고 적은 揷話를 하나 적어보고저한다.
通信의 機敏, 通信機團의 最大限度의 活用이 相當히힘＜49＞든일일한다. 적은 時間에 가장 만흔 材料를 取集하여 가장 效果的으로 報導함에는 通信, 交通機關의 活用如何가 크게 關係된다 其中에서는 電報記事가 困難한 것 中의 하나이다.
年前에 間島 共産黨暴動事件에 龍井村 郵便局에서 當하든 苦痛도생각하면 그런 一例이엇거니와 昨年秋 大阪風水害때 出張햇을時에는 龍井 出張時의 類例가안이엇다.
卽 龍井出張時는 事件發生한 卽夜로 出發하엿으나 龍井에 들어가기지에는 一晝夜半을 要함으로 龍井까지 들어가서 거기에서 取材를 해가지고 通信(電話)을한다면 넘어 느려진다 잘못하면 달은 通信문보다 通信이느저지기쉽다 그러게된다면 特派의 意味가 업서지게될터임으로 될수잇는 대로는 龍井村에 들어가지 前에 通信機關을 私出할수업슬하는 것이 當時나의 苦心의 하나이엇다 羅南에서부터 會寧으로 上三峰을 거저들어가는 동안 龍井事情을 探訪한다는 것이다 僥倖 比較的正確히 事件의 大略을알수잇서 上三峰에서 發電할수잇섯다. 그러면 그 어方法을 取햇느냐 여기에 말해도 조켓으나 그태여 自己의 拙策을 暴露키 북그러움으로 略한다 그리고 龍井에 들어갓을때이다 郵便局에 들어가서 外務省과 總督府로 가는 官報電話가 山가치 싸이어잇서 私信電報가튼 것은 問題도안된다 不得已 至急電話를 해주는수는업다. 그러든中에 郵便局員이 크게 好意를보이며 普通新聞電話로 速히 取扱해주마하여 普通新聞電話로 通信은 하엿으나 極히 困難하엿다 주머니에 通信費는 어저가고 通信은 잘안되니 所謂特派員의 名色이어듸잇을
大阪갓을 때야 말로 暫間道理를 못채렷다 福岡지 가서알어보니 大阪福岡間 電信電話不通으로 大阪大每가 飛行機로 原稿를 날러다가 號外를 發行햇다가 一例로 보아도 通信의 苦痛이 如干 안인 것을 알수잇섯다 福岡에 다엇든 翌日朝다시 飛行機로 大阪에 들어갓든날저녁지도 市內電話가 不通된곳이 만헛섯다 요행이 電話가겨우 通하엿다고하고 電信도 겨우 直通은 된다고 하나 저녁에 郵便局에 달려가 電信 電話線의 事情을 물으니 二, 三時間이나 四, 五時間遲延이 問題가 안이라고 한다 電信局 窓口에는 遲速의 保障을 할수업다는 것이다 더구나 長文의 新聞電報이니 아무리 至急報이라 해도 턱업시 느러질 것은 더말할것업섯다. 그 우리는 非常手段의 길이업슬까하고 생각 하든中 某方面의 特別한 便宜로 不過 二時間以內에 一貢大의 號外가 될 原稿를＜50＞ 보낼수잇슨 것은 意外의 일이엇다.
그리고 電信 電話는 全部 至急報이다 電話는 一通話 二圓九十錢의 三倍이요 電報도 一音信(五十字)三十錢의 三倍이다 電報는 和文「假名」一字에 一錢九厘이니 諺文을 釋하면 每한字에 三錢乃至 四錢 假量된다 電話도 어날밤에는 한번에 約三十分式至急報하여 한時會計에 八, 九十圓式내인도잇다. 그러케 돈을 내던지고도 電話통을 붓들기 지가  如干힘든일이안이엇다.
여기지 가면 記者生活의 苦心보다도 通信에나타난 資本戰이다 (끝)
女記者回想錄

新聞記者悲哀
						邵城閑人
一, 新聞記者의 悲哀
現代에잇서서는 新聞社業도 一企業體이오 資本閥에 隷屬하여잇는 機關인만큼 新聞도 商品化할수밧게업고 商品化한만큼, 新聞도 利潤을 本位로하지안흘수업게되엇다. 그에 따러 新聞記者라는것도 一個의 雇傭人에 不過하고 資本家의 利用物에 不過한 것이다. 그럼으로써 新聞記者라는것도 一種의 職業이오 決코 前日일커러내려오든바와가티 過大評價한 無冠의 帝王이나 白頭의 帝王이라는 尊稱을 밧는 榮貴한 名稱을 밧는것이못된다. 卽한개의 企業에부터다니는 被傭人에 不過하고 生産部分에 努力을 파는 一個職工에 不過한 것이다. 그런데 徃徃히 世人은 新聞社業이라는 것을 誇張하야 民衆의 代言機關이니 犧牲的文敎事業이라고떠바뜰고 또여기에 從事하는 新聞人을 無冠帝王이라고 推尊을하여준다 그러한바람에 自身들도 이 過評에 惑하야 自身은맛치 一般民衆을 指導하며 끌고나아가＜57＞는 權威잇는 特種의 人物인척하야 고만 誇大妄想症에걸려그야말로 新聞社에 奉職하게되면 特出한 階級에 屬한 別個人物이나된것처럼 自尊自大의 妄想을하게된다.
그러나 그 實을생각하고보면 가장 悲慘한 職業에 從事하는 雇傭人이다. 世上에서 가장손가락질을바드며 敬遠의 待遇를밧는사람에 屬하여잇고 世上의 暗黑面이나 사람의 裡面만살펴가며 그것을 綻路시키고 그것을꾀집어내는 一種「두터지」生活을하는 怪變의 人이 新聞記者이다. 그러니만큼것트로는 가장 自由스러운 職業에 從事하는것갓지만은 가장불상하고 可憐한 職業을 하는 것이 新聞記者라는 職業이다. 이것을모르고 新出新聞記者들은 그야말로 新聞社에 한번 발을듸듸면 登龍門이나한것가티 날뛰다가 一生을그릇치는 것이다.
이것은 大體로 新聞記者라는 職業自體를 解剖한것인데 外界關係로도 그러하지만 一次新聞社內에잇서서의 生活을들추어보는 것이 本題의 核心인만큼 本題로들어가랴하는바 그보다도먼저말하여두는 것은 前述한바와가티 新聞도한 企業이오 資閥의 玩弄物에 不過하는만큼 勞資關係의 太甚한 것은 돌이어 營利團體나 利潤本位의 會社보다 尤甚하다는것이오 그와 同時에 一個新聞社內의 從屬되어잇는 被庸人인 新聞記者의 社內生活은 能히 다른사람으로서 窺視하여볼수업는 悲慘한 悲哀가 숨어잇는 것이다.

新聞記者라고하면 普通新聞社編輯局에 屬하야 探訪(社會部) 外報(政治面), 內報(地方部) 經濟, 學藝, 校正等에 從事하는사람의 通稱인데 一般으로서는 新聞社에 從事하는 사람이면 모조리 記者라고하는 名稱을 부처주는터이다. 新聞社의 內部組織이 編輯, 營業, 工務로 分하야잇는데 記者라는 것은 編輯局에 屬한 一部를일커름이오 營業, 工務에 屬하여잇는사람은 記者가아니라 社員이다. 이 區分은 何如間新聞社內에는 幹部, 準幹部, (編輯次長, 主幹, 部長級等等)가잇고 그다음에는 緣故者卽舊參者가잇고 그다음으로 新出, (모다 平記者라고한다)의 區別이잇스니 各部에 責任者所謂部長아래에 舊參者가잇고 그다음으로 普通平記者가잇서 다 各各 그 階級이 懸殊하다. 幹部級에 屬하는 所謂財閥에 屬하는 企業家는 그 他會社에서보는바와가티 特權階級에 屬하여서 그 權力이야말로 神聖不可侵이어서 橫暴를 恣行하게되면 그야말로 莫能當이다. 外面關係로는 直接監督官廳의비위만맛추어가면그만이요 其他는모다 眼下의 無人이오 더구나 營利會社等은 自己들의 「밥」으로여긴다. 그리고 內面으로는 所謂記者라는 各自를쓰고잇는사람들은 每月幾十圓의 俸給을주는만큼 使用人으로의 賤待가 오히려 다른 企業會社에 그것보다도 甚하다. 時間의 長短, 生活의 安不＜58＞安, 馳驅使役의 甚不甚을 莫論하고 그 勞力의 搾取야만로 任意自在이면서도 幹部級에 屬한 人物들에게 多少라도 反抗을한다든지 理由의 不當함을 抗辯할때에는 그야말로 큰 變이난 듯이 그 記者는 「反逆罪人」以上으로 排擊하고 卽時로 罷免을하는 것이다. 幹部級에 一言이면 絶大服從을하여야 記者의목은 부터잇게되지 一言이라도 是非曲直을말하면 그사람은 그 當時로 그 社를 作別할 覺悟가잇서야한다달은 社會에서는 求職의 餘裕期間을주어서 罷免을하는바이지만은 新聞社라는데는 一刀兩斷의 時刻待令이다. 그런까닭에 外界에서는 가장 尊稱(?)을밧는 新聞記者이지만 內部에들어가서는 飮食店配達夫보다도 더욱 賤待를밧는 것이 新聞記者이다. 그래서 自然新聞記者生活을 오래할나고하면 新聞企業家에 屬한 幹部級에는 絶對服從을하여야하고 한거름더나아가서는 平記者의 無冠를 免하고 相當한 地位나 名記者의 聞名을날이랴면 幹部의비위를맛추고 甚至於병정이되어야하고 아첨을하고 끄나풀이되어야하는 것이다. 적어도 每日에 數十次例의 私宅訪問이잇고 年數十次의 「요공」을하여서 그 歡心을사야하고 憮恤의 代債를 支佛하여야하는 것이다. 最近의 一例로는 某新聞社의 可謂「벼락部長」이라는 地位를 어든 怜悧한사람의 例가그것이다. 一擧에 累進하여 不過數朔內로 樞要(?)한 地位를차지하고 그 社內의 勢力은 그야말로 獨逸, 히틀러 大統領의 亞將인 「宣傳相」부럽잔케된그것을보아도 알 것이다. 技術如何, 能率如何, 素質의 適不適, 資格의 充不充은 第二第三의 條件이오 오직「요공」의 多過, 補脾胃의 善不善으로 그 出久한 地位를 獲得하는 것이 第一條件이된다. 이것은 너머甚한말인지는몰으나 그 地位, 向上의 가장 要衝을 把握하랴면 最高權威者인 卽 資金을내노흔 人物의 끄나풀이되든지 그러지못하면 그 唯一無二의 사랑과 信任을밧는병정의병정노릇이라도 하여야 持久性이잇는 것이다. 卽最高幹部(로봇트는除外)의 直系派에 약삭바르게 들러붓지못하면 如何한 能率, 技術, 素質을 가지고잇더래도 이것은 永久한 不運兒오 努力에 比하야 報償은 적은 使傭人으로 平生을맛치다가 자칫잘못하야 一朝一夕에목이다러나고마는 것이다. 이 事例도 前年某新聞社의 例를보면 알수잇다. 一夜之間에 十餘名을 馘首하되 寸暇의 餘裕도업섯스며 一分의 退職手當도 업섯든 것이다 이얼마나 可憐한 情景이며 따라지목숨이든고?―.
三派, 閥我黨의 拔扈
朝鮮은 古來로 偏色, 黨爭의 桎梏에서 요지경이되엇고, 지금도 地方熱, 班閥, 黨色으로 百尺竿頭에섯슴으로 그것을 打破한다고 떠들고 그것을 排擊하여야한다고 紙上으로서 大書特書하며 가장 그 黨色派閥에서는 超越한것가티 堂堂數千言의 論陣을퍼지만은 그 實際에들어가서보면 그야＜59＞말로 黨色派閥의 巢窟이 新聞社이다. 情實과 派閥로 全體를 假裝하고잇스니 地方熱도여기서볼수잇고 派閥我黨은여기서 차질수잇다. 西北人은 西北人이모히고 湖南人은 湖南人으로판을짜고 畿湖人은 畿湖人本位로하되그것도 一定한 標準이잇는것이아니오오직 經營者의 親近人, 乃至經營者의 唯一한 信任을밧는者의 信任을밧는 人間들 卽그社內에서 得勢를하고잇는 人物의 一派가 全體人間을 取捨選擇하게되는것이니 編輯局長이 得勢를하는 新聞社에서는 記者의 大多數가 그 系統의 人物로 網羅되고 營業局長이 得勢하는 社이면 厥의 系統으로 入社를한사람이어야 社內에서 활갯짓을하게된다. 또 社長이면 社長, 副社長이면 副社長, 主筆, 次長其他等等 모다그社內에는 千差萬別의 派閥이잇서 서로 權力을 扶植하고저 暗暗裡에 虎視耽耽하고 機會到來를하엿다가 그中가장 得勢한 一派로 歸屬되고마는 것이다. 옛날 某社에서는 編輯局長이 老論이엇스니 營業局長은 少論으로두자고한 것이 一時는 話題꺼리가되어 一般의 恥笑를바덧섯지만 지금은 單純히 그러치도안허 當色的分類보다도, 我黨으로의 權力扶植이 主觀이되여 某派가 權力을잡으면그一派縱橫自在하랴고하며 그 派가 失脚을하면 고다음가는 一派가 고개를처들고나스랴고하야 無言中에 爭鬪가 繼續되고 外面은 談笑中에서라도 暗鬪가 繼續되는바이다. 가장 實例로는 現在某社는 主權者의 心腹인 某局長一派가 得勢를하야 여기에 訶諛加擔된 몃몃分子가 大勢를 左右하며 自派에 屬하지안흔 社員은 營業編輯工務를 勿論하고 거의 潰波을 當하고말엇다한다. 編輯局長보다 次長이 編輯局을 統率左右하야 그 圈屬內에들지안는사람은 모조리 不過의 處地에잇고 入社數日에라도 그 部類에 屬하면 待遇나 諸般것이 舊來社員보다 極等하고 部長이××局長의 勢를 밋고 跋扈로 敢行하는 等實로 首尾頭倒의 亂麻的狀態를 呈하고잇스며 또 某社나가튼 것은 ××局長獨裁의 王國을일우어 다른 局가튼 것은 營業의 主從關係가잇는것가티 끽소리도못하고있으니 我黨天下도 이 程度에일으면 그 極致에일은것이라고볼수밧게업다. 이러코보니 그네들이 標榜하는 論旨와 裡面과는 判異할뿐아니라 假面을쓰고잇는 것이 얼마나 矛盾되는것을알 것이다. 그럼으로 이가튼 圈屬에 放置된 記者야말로 여러 가지 苦衷과 氷炭가튼 時日을거듭하며 울며「게자」먹기로 每日每日, 馳驅와 使役을 甘受할수밧게업는바이오 그것에 不平을가젓스면 一時라도 速히 自決을하여야하는 것이다. 거기서 多少라도 不平을 露出하든지 是非를가리다가는 어느귀신이잡어가는지몰으게 목이달어나고마는 것이다.
四, 努力搾取의 過大
新聞社라고하면 前日까지는 무슨 思想團體나 一種政治機關가티생각하야 처음에는 民衆의 先導者나된것처럼 貧＜60＞困에부댁겨도 外方에는그야말로 「무사태평」을 假裝하고 「냉수마시고 이쑤시」는 行動을 假飾하고잇섯다. 그래서 數個月, 數十個月을두고 給料를밧지못해도 꾸준히 新聞그것을 爲하야 아니 어떤 意味로의 機關을살니기 爲하야 家藏汁物을모조리팔고 曲執을하여가면서도 그社의 職을 奉行하고 잇섯든 것이다. 이것이 經營者의 腦裡에박여 이가튼 心理를 巧妙히 利用하고 特權視하는 名利心을 巧妙히 捕捉하야 그 努力을 過大히 搾取하엿고 그 勞苦를될수잇는데까지 鞭韃하엿든 것이다 營利會社가 敢히이가튼 行動을하엿드면 勞資關爭도 數百番數千番으로 헤아릴수업슬 것이다. 그 前某社의 幹部들은 每月料亭에 出入하야 數千圓式消費하고 作妾을하여가지고 豪華러운 生活을하면서도 社員의 俸給은 數十個月式支拂치안코 社員의 生活이얼마나 悲慘한지도 不顧하고 自身의 利慾만을채워갓스되 일즉이 反省함이업섯든 것이다. 지금도 傳聞에 들으면 某社는 社員의 俸給이 퍼적어 他社의 三分之二或은 二分之一도못되고 모든 것을 極度로 節約한다고하면서도 第一急先務가 社×이든지? 數萬金을던저서  社×을 宏壯히지어서들고잇다하며 或은 某某幹部는 鑛山에 着手를하엿다는둥 社金를 利用하야 個人住宅을지엇다는等 先約하엿든  社×의 椅子를달은사람에게준 代로집을지어주엇다는等하면서 社員들의 俸給은 努力에 比하야 너머나 過少하야 그야말로 體面維持도못할지경이오 될수만잇스면 「야스月給」의 新出見習記者만 使用하야 마니아와세新聞을내놋코도 泰然自若하다고하니 이야말로 民衆을 愚弄하고 社員의 努力만을 過大히 搾取하는것이아니면 무엇인고? 論於至此에돌이혀 寒心한생각이 스스로남을 禁치못하며 그 社의 社員들에게 同情을 不禁하는바이다. 左右間努力搾取에는 新聞社幹部들이 가장 權威者일 것이다. 그러나 萬若 달은 營利會社나 또는 其他資本閥에서 이가튼일이잇다고만하면 가장 勞動者의 便을 擁護하는드키 大書特書하야 그 不法을 糾彈하기에조금도 容赦가업는바이다. 果然이것이 打背撫腹者流의 可憎한 行動이라고 評한들 무슨입으로 對答을할것인고?
五 結言
新聞記者의 社內生活裡面記를 쓴다는 것 意外로 幹部들에 對한 嶮口로 變한 感이업지안치만은 左右間新聞記者라는 生活이 外面은 外面대로 不遇의 處地에잇고 內面에들어오면 그야말로 살어름판에 발을듸듸는것가티 每月戰戰兢兢하야 그날그날을지내간다. 一方으로는 聯務에 充實하여야하고 또그다음으로는 幹部들의 「비위」를맛추어야 하고 또때로는 巧言令色이나마 그네들의 歡心을사야하고 또 一便으로 得勢派의 直系의 氣色도살펴야한다. 이얼마나쓰라린 生活이며 悲慘한 人間이리오? 所謂文敎의 業에 從事하는 記者로서 또 民衆의 師表가되어야한다는 記者들의 內面生活＜61＞이이와가티 矛盾과 不合理투성이니 이것을 알고보면 어느 누구 新聞社에발을 듸려노흐랴고할것인가(그럿치안흔社는잇기는하지만)뭇노니 現下朝鮮에서 新聞記者로 奉職하는 記者로서 能히이것에 「노-」라고하는 否定을내릴수잇슬까? 否定을하는사람이잇다면 이것은 幹部들의 庇護아래서 得勢를하는 部類에 屬한 人物이거나 不然이면 低能白痴의 천등벌거숭이가아니면 아닐것이라고 斷定하는바이다. 昭和十年十二月三日-(끝)-
初代記者回想錄
						鄭禹澤
語弊가잇을른는지는몰으나 畏友車先生의 俗所謂 아닌밤중에 홍두깨미는 格으로 記者生活의 回想記를 쓰라는 命令을 拜手하고는 갑자기 過去의 經驗한 頭緖를잡지몯하고 果然 쩔쩔매이든 끝에 문득된둥만둥 生覺키는대로쓰고저한다 以前舊韓國時代 社長李鍾一氏의 帝國新聞과 南宮檍氏의 皇城新聞當時붙어 新聞의 趣味를비로소 覺得하고는 每日投稿하기와 風寒暑濕을 不顧하고 주머니속잔돈푼으로 講讀에 熱中타기 其後大韓每日申報社의 梁起鐸氏를 알기시작하야 그때 編輯長主筆이든 朴殷植先生과 緊密한 連絡을 取하야가며 每個月十五圓式받아가며 探報記者가되어 서투른솜씨에 記者責任은 간신히밟아왓섯다. 그리다가 世上이 變轉無常함을 딿아 大韓每日申報의 影子는어는 듯 消散하고 至今의 每日新報가 그後身이되어 大和町一隅몇 間茅屋에서 京城日報와함께 社會를 爲하야 盡力케되엇든 것이다. 그때 筆者는 浪人의 身勢를짓고 僅少한 遺産으로써 一家를 扶支하게되엇섯으나 幸히 中村健太郞氏의 불음을닙어 生來의처음 每日申報社에드러가서 記者生活의 正規를 밟게되엇으니 鍛鍊된 才操는없엇스나 눈치껏 大記者노릇을하게됏든것도 至今에 回想하면 厚顔無恥漢이라는 評도들을만하엿지만 그래도 少年記者로는 資格이떳떳하엿든것이엇다. 入社初日두군거리는가슴을 부둥켜쥐고 面面히 人事를맟이고나니까 編輯長 卞一氏가 讀者俱樂部를 쓰라고 命令한다. 그때 何夢李相協氏는 나보다멫달앞서셔 入社하엿고 一齊趙重恒氏는 外勤兼小說을쓰고 잇섯다 나의 長技는 讀者俱樂部인까닭에 隣間한단가량이나 써서드리밀엇다. 얼마만에 採字되고 植字되어 校正스리로드러오는것을보니까 어찌나 神通하고도 好奇心이 挑發되는지몰랏섯다 그 翌日市內各警察署와 裁判所出入記者로 每日每日材料蒐集코저 도라다니기 始作하엿다. 그때쯤은 窃盜나 行旅死亡者나 失家兒의 材料를어더오면 特種記事는못되지만 編輯長의 取捨選擇에서 二號一段題目붙처 登載되든판인데 어떠케 잘 取得을해와야 一號二段題目부치는것을보나? 하는생각이 耿耿一念에꿈자리까지 散亂하엿든 것이다. 더구나 競爭의＜62＞ 相對敵이잇엇으니 그는 朝鮮新聞附錄 朝鮮文朝鮮新聞記者車君과 隱然中不覺의 取材다툼이생기어서 社會記事中에도 車君에게 見奪된 記事가많어서 編輯監督의 松尾氏의 눈물나는 訓責도무던히들어오며 一計를 案出하야 各劇場招待券으르써 코아렛 進上을하야가며 每日아침동냥 求乞을하는데 그런지 未幾에나의 成績이 越等하야저서 記者다운 記者行世를하여왓다.

어느때인가 新曆으로 一月一日新年劈頭가되엇는데 내가 第一先着으로 出社하니까 그때 松尾氏가 『方今昌德宮에 火災가낫으니 時急號外를맨들 必要上 人力車타고 馳徃하야 始終을 探求하야오되 皇室에 關係된 記事이니 各別注意』하라고한다 첫 번 盃盤인지라 허둥지둥昌德宮門前까지놓고는 敢히 入門치몯하고 附近에서어정대이는데 日本人記者들은 活氣잇는거름 緊張된낫으로 연방 筆記帖에쓰는라고 奔走하엿으나 나는 門外漢처름남의일보듯하고잇노라니 첫제 車夫가부끄러워서견댈수없엇다. 盲目的벙어리채로 社에 回還할 生覺을하매 가슴만답답하고 神經이 痲痺되는듯해서 죽을지경이든판에 幸히 親面잇는 金德弘部長이 鎭火뒤나오는 것을 붓잡고 自初至終을 査問햇으나 奔忙中不得要領이어서 槪要만어더가지고 歸社卽時붓대를 잡고보니 先忘後失이되어 原稿紙까저버린 張數만도거의 勿驚-五六十張이엇섯다 억지춘향이 格으로 號外를내고보니 가슴은 爽然하고 한편으로 氣盡脈盡하야 便할 때엔 便해도 어려울때엔 뭇척어려운 것은 新聞記者生活임을 뒤늦게깨다럿든 것이다.
悠長한 歲月 三百六十五日사히 不眠休神奇한 記事材料探得에 出沒無常얼마던고 올타 京城市內한복판에 異常한 所聞이새여나왓으니 그는무엇이든가? 記者生活멫해에 이것은듯도보도몯하든 奇怪千萬의 特種材料를엇고는 밥먹을줄도잇고 좋아라고 雀躍하엿다.
★三日안 新婦가 毒婦로 突變新郞을 絞殺코저
시내배다리께(現今舟橋町)남쪽개천변으로 나려가노라면 그중간허술한초가집이잇엇는데 그집아들(十七歲)이 동촌갓밧치일하는집규수와 혼약이결정되어 가위육례를가초아 장가가고시집오게되니 삼일을신랑의집에서 치르게되엇엇다. 혼인은 인륜의대사이오 종생의 짝을지을경사이매 일가친척이며 동리사람의하례소리도비발치듯하야 두집사히에는 서운(瑞雲)이어리웟다. 그때는 추팔월망간이라 유리알같은 밝은달빛은 사정없이도 신혼의 단꿈을꾸일 신방에 나리빛어잇고 이따금식나무닢을흔드러＜63＞ 놋는소소성은 벌서붙어 가을의비애를늣길만하게된 어느날초저녁밤이엇엇다. 신랑보다 한 살더된신부는 요모도얌전하고 숙성하기짝이없어 범어만사에 거츰새없이 숙달할대로 숙달하엿지마는 신랑되는자는 나히는불계하고 부모앞에서 무한한사랑을 받어가며대문깐을 잘나가지않든 소위맹추라기보담도세상물정에는 더구나장님이고보매 부모덕에 장가라고 가기는갓으나 생리적 요령도 담벼락이어서 아조분별몰으느숙맥이엇다. 약고약은 신부는 첫 번겻눈한번에 신랑의 좋고낫븐 끔새를 모다 알어채리고는 신혼지초에 해연한눈물이옷깃을적시이며 팔자한탄을하기가되엇다.

한숨을 땅이꺼지도록 쉬이며 쉬이며 눈을나리고 곰곰이 생각하고 잇노라니 신혼멫일안에 신방을사람이 문을뚤코 들여다보지않으면 그대신귀신이 엿본다는 조선전래의 관습은커녕 완고한미신에얽매인 집안의 여자들은 제각기다토아 손에춤칠을해가며 대호지로 단단히바른문창을 감안히 뚤고 히히대며드려다보나 어언간왼천하를 밝혀주든보름달은 서천에기우러저 새벽쌀한바람이 문창을 요동시켜 첫겨울인상을 자아내엿다. 이것이 아마 새벽세시가훨신 넘엇을때이엇스나 신부방의 촉화는 더욱 휘황하고 숨소리조차없는 방안의 공긔는 정말로 적막을 늣기엇고 고양이가 쥐들어르드시 서로대치하야 버틔고만 잇엇으니 집안사람들은 의아천만으로 불안공포의 눈츠리만서로부드칠뿐이엇다. 밤은삼경이 넘엇건만 신랑신부의 뜬눈으로철야게야말로 모든사람의 시선을 더욱이 이끌고말엇든 것이다. 은근히 조바심을하든 신랑은 젓먹든용긔를다내여 신부에게 갓가히가서 옷을 벗기여 자리에누이고저햇섯으나 사생을도모코 웅치않음에 어찌할것인가 그대로 할수없이 그밤을밝히고는 그럭저럭 해를보내게되엇으니 아모리숙맥천진이라한들 밤도라오는 것이 무엇보다도 원수같이 역엿든 것이다.

★朝鮮옷닙고 釜山갓다가긔막혓든일한가지
하도오래다니니까 累進累昇으로 地方部長在任時의일.
東京게신 李王殿下께서 멫해만에처음 朝鮮에오시게되여 公式行次이엇슴으로 朝鮮서 官民上下間에 떠들썩거려 出迎케되엇는데 言論界로는 京城日報社會部記者 野崎眞三(現在朝鮮新聞社會部長)每甲側으론 筆者한사람, 釜山까지 特派되어 夜行車를 京城驛에서타게되엿다. 먼저 말하야＜65＞둘 것은 生來의 洋服나 一는 부처보지도못하엿을뿐외라 닙어볼 勇氣조차없이 그날그날의 行色은 變치않고 朝鮮옷두루마기에 팔갓치않은 新聞記者이매 한번 對面하는사람은 一驚을 喫할수밖에없이되엇섯다. 또그리고 單十里밖 行裡를 해본 經驗이없는나로서는 釜山千里가 하도엄청도나거니와 往來의어떠한 方式쪼차 熟麥이고보니 또가슴만두군거릴뿐이엇으나 社長의 命令을받은지라 맨몸둥이로 南門驛에나가니 車는 方今떠날 隣間인데 마침 前記野崎君을맛나 同車바람에 저옥이 安心은되엇지만 寢臺車타는줄은 꿈밖에일인 故로미리 申請도않햇으니 名牌야잇슬리가잇나 한참 辛苦타가 車中專務令監의 德分으로간신히 下層寢臺車를사가지고 키큰 우리로서는 空然한등꼽추노름을하기에 잠도못니루고 날이밝으면 나의 顧問格의 野崎君을 見失할까 념려가돼서 苦生苦生을하다가 於焉東方이 旣白이라 나오자니 着靴가 不知去處, 깜작놀라 두루 搜索통에 給仕君의고마운구두닥기 까닭이엇다. 釜山驛은 內外共히 鐵瓮城같이 警戒가 森嚴한 中을 通過하자니-(五字略)- 나한사람뿐. 빼지않고 檢問의 關文을 記者덕으로 通過되어 埠頭에나섯으니 얼마안되어서 聯絡船은다으며 여긔저긔 出迎者로 雜踏을 極하자 官民接見이잇다하야 記者團들은 왼통 船上接見室로몰리는데 가엽시도 洋服못닙은나는 벙벙이 埠頭近處에서 徘徊하야 착실한 무슨 警戒를 한 貌樣쯤되고보니 한편으론 羞恥롭기도하고 또한 憤하기도하야 스스로 地方部長의 資格을 喪失하고만세음이다. 朝鮮옷닙은사람을 어찌나 敬讓하는지 그때붙어 洋服의 必要를 切實히늣겻다. 그러나 또그때분이엇섯다.
자-그러고보니 공연히수구스럽게 汽車身勢만진 것이 아닌가 하는 生覺에 忿하기짝이없엇다. 殿下타신뒤차 卽記者團탄 車한편자리를어더 안끼는햇으나 그 車안도 亦是(四字略)나하나뿐이엇다. 給仕가 點心을미리 注文하는데 훌륭한 洋服紳士에앞에는 平身低頭로 차레차레밧다가 마침내차레에까지와서는 한번힐끗처다보드니 잠잠히돌아서가버린다. 忿한마음이 가라안기도 前에 또 大창피를 當하고도 空腹에할 수 없어 갓가수로 食堂을더듬어가서 구차한 點心한 그릇을 一金五十錢也 赤口充腸한 後에 내자리에 돌아오니 鐸內가서로 談笑風發로 한창꽃이피엇지만 나와 相對할 者는 생겨나지도않엇든 것이다. 너무나 無聯하야 釜山千里를 坐禪을하며 不知中上京한일도잇섯지마는 朝鮮옷 虐待란 甚旦甚失. 地方部長任務를 다못한 熟麥으로는 自愧를 禁치못하엿다. 그후는 朝鮮옷닙고는 一切鐵道旅行이라고는구지 斷念한일도잇엇다. 呵呵大笑.
★붓대하나로…………一家族살린이야기
멫十年新聞記者生活中에 第一痛快하고 滋味스런일 한가＜66＞지를적어보려한다.
末伏못밋처 어느여름날밤이엇는데 京城黃金町 光武臺附近을 지내노라니까 北便人道邊에 어떤살림살이 한 家口가생기엇다 하도 異常하야 갓가히가서본즉 可謂幕天席地로 네귀에가느다란나무가지로 기둥삼고다찌어진 襤褸한치마자락을 土담삼아가리운속에 一家食口가 웅긔중긔안저서 서로를 얼굴만 처다보고앉엇으니 뭇지않어도집없어 올데갈데없는 處地로서 할수없이 露天生活을하는 것이 分明하엿다. 어려운사람일스록 子息福은 많은 셈으로 두 夫婦사히에는 所生이다섯이나된다. 큰놈이 十四歲가 最高로 그아래로는 두 살터울아니면 세 살터울식되엇고 家長되는 사람은 그때나히 四五十고개에니르럿는데 그의안해는 설흔세살밖에안된 젊은부인이다. 一見에 風貌라든지 차림차림이를보면 그닥지 下流階級의 무지막지한사람으로는 보히지않엇다.
사람이끈일새없이 오고가고하는 大路邊에 젊은 家屬을더리고 우두머니않어잇는그사람의 凄絶慘絶한 그 心境이야 오즉하엿으랴 짓꾸진젊은사람들은 일부러기웃이 들여다보고 쓸데없는걱정보탬을하지마는 그에게는 無限히도 對答할힘조차 없을뿐외라 도모지 낫치따거워서 擧頭를못할지경이엇다.
그때 新聞記者로서의 나는 그의 情景이 하도딱하야 同情 ■■■■■■■■음을깨닷지못하엿다 事情을듯기前에 于先 가엽슨 生覺이 衝動되어 自初至終을 親切히물어보앗다.
本是는 京城胎生으로 裕足한 生活을하다가 漸漸家運이 衰敗하야가매 田庄마직이잇는 京畿道淸州郡에 移住하야 農土에몸이백혀제법 農園에 興味를가지고지내나 온집안 眷率의 糊口는커녕 이곳저곳의 負債로말미암아 一年동안 피땀으로 지어논 農事는 그 蛇蝎같은 債鬼와 暴虐한 地主의 뱃속만불려주고 남은 것은 뱃단멫묵금에 不過하야 朝夕難繼로 우거지 粥도한술가락 뜨지몯하는 形便에 到達하엿으니 어찌하루살이목숨이나마 扶支할수잇습니까 한가지 두가지식 稍蠶食之로 다팔아업새고나니 그곳서도 살 수 없어 젊은 妻子를 데리고 눈물어리운발길을 내여드듼 것이 서울이엇음니다 누가불은것도 오란것도아니지만 活路엇고자 死線에서헤매는 닐곱식구가 거리에서 彷徨타가 草洞(林町)근처어떤집 行廊하나를 갓가수록어더놓고 궁둥이는 奠接되엇으니 그날그날 입에 풀칠할 生覺이 漠然하야 닐곱식구가 떼송장이나게 되엇을즈음 勞動이어떤것인지 듯도보도못하든 軟骨의 몸으로 아침새벽이면 꾸드러빠진조밥댕이를싼변또를옆에끼고 줄다름처 일터라고 쫓처가서는 온종일길거리에서 땅을파고잇으니 俗所謂「땅패기」란말과같이 世上에어려웁고 힘들기는 땅파기같이 뭇척어려운 것은 업슬뜻하여요 해가 西쪽하늘에 기우러질때이면 일이맛치＜67＞어지는시간이라 겨우 三十五錢이란 債金을바다가지고 도라오면 철모르는자식들은 「아버지 돈벌어가지고왓다」고좋아라고뛰는꼴은 그때그때금창이터질 듯이 압흐기보다도뜨거운눈물이 줄줄이흘러 볼상한안해로더부터 소리내며 痛哭도 많이하엿소이다.
過去멫해동안 눈물나는 苦生살이이야기를 말하자면 아직도실꾸리가풀리지도않은셈이니까 대강대강합니다만 雪上加霜格으로 바라지도않는 解腹날은 머지않어 臨迫하고먹을 것을 없어 아이들의 밥달나고 우는소리는 아비된이놈의 가슴이 얼마나 답답하겟습니까 아-靑天의 霹靂이나렷습니다 안집의 順産달과 마조처서 한집에서는 絶對로함께 出産을못하는 法이라고 逐出令이나렷습니다 멫일 猶豫를 哀乞햇으나 금방나가라고 쫓차내이는데 奈何? 할수없이 여긔까지 쫓겨나왓읍니다만 오늘아침도굶고 氣盡力盡하야 죽게되엇습니다 더욱이가엽기는 將次臨月이된안해의일어딱하여요.
하며 흙흙늣겨운다. 이말을듯고나니 朝鮮은 人情나라라는데 어쩌면 事情없이 쫓차내엿을까 그의 無慈悲함에 놀라지않을수없엇다. 주머니를터러 一金壹圓也를내여주고간절히 慰勞하야주엇다 나는갑작이 決心한배잇엇다 明日出社하는 卽時 다른것은제처놓고라도 그들의 딱한事情을 社會에하소하야 一分의 同情金이라도어더서 어려운사람붓드러주는것도 오직헛된일이아니겟다는 生覺下에 一週日이나 大書特字로 悲絶慘絶한 情景을 如實히그려놓앗다 그 翌日붙어 同情金이 還至하기시작하야 三日內에 大金三百圓이라는눈물에저즌돈이드러왓다 나의마음에얼마나좋고 깃벗을까, 卽時그곳을차저가서 그말을 傳하고 于先 방한간을 傳世하야 갈데없는식구를 居接케한 後에 쌀한섬 나무한바리를가득이 準備하야노앗다 그리고남어지돈은 銀行에 貯金하고 必要잇을때차저쓰되 거긔서얼마나 順産제구에 當케하고 그것을 큰미천삼아 길거리에서 군밤장사를 始作케하엿다 그네들의 좋아함보다 듯는사람의 社會에 對한 感謝를 마지않엇다
이것으로써 우연한 因緣의 結晶이되어 오늘날까지 義와 情을닛지안호 親族以上으로차저다니는 그의 信義도 衷心으로감사한다. 죽음에서 更生이된 그 一家는 그것으로 唯一한 財團삼아 朝飯夕粥이라도 결느지않고 잘지내간다는 말을 들을 때 무엇보담도 고마운늣김에서눈물만 縱橫할뿐. 이것이 第一新聞記者生活로서의 印象깊은 所感一節.＜68＞
