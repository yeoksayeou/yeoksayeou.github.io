Editor's Afterthoughts

This issue has been specially planned as a "Newspaper Criticism Issue." Although the current newspapers, which call themselves the public instruments (公器) of the populace and the wooden bells (木鐸) of society, are in an unfavorable environment, it is a matter commonly lamented by the general public that they too often fall short of our expectations. At this time, with our humble sincerity (微誠), we represent the public will (民意) to earnestly (切實) demand and promote newspaper improvement, and simultaneously, with the intention of promoting the diffusion (普及) of newspaper knowledge (新聞智識) to the general public, we have specially edited this issue in this manner.

★

However, due to the urgency (急迫) of time and the special circumstances of our various writers, we deeply regret (遺憾) that we could not achieve the fully planned (豫定) content. At the same time, we cannot help but apologize (謝) to our readers that it could not be published on its regular schedule (定期) and is only now being released as a combined February-March issue (合倂號).

★

One of our colleagues (同人), Hwaewŏl (懷月), was unexpectedly arrested (檢束) in connection with a certain incident, which was one reason (所以) why our already short-handed staff became even busier. But primarily, some members damaged their health due to consecutive days of hard struggle, leading us to cause unintended unease (未安). Fortunately (多幸), Mr. Kang Sŏng-gu (姜聖九), who was our Shanghai (上海) special correspondent (特派員), happened to return home (歸鄕) and greatly assisted with this issue's work. It has been informally decided (內定) that he will remain with our company (本社) for some time going forward, which is a fortunate event amidst misfortune (不幸 中 多幸).

★

As this issue is being published as a Newspaper Criticism Issue, the main lead articles (卷頭 主要論文) and most of the middle reading material (中間讀物) have had to be postponed to the next issue. We feel apologetic (罪悚) to the writers, but this too was unavoidable (不得已), and we hope for your understanding (恕諒). At the same time, what we particularly wish to boast about is the grand spectacle (盛觀) of this issue's literature section (文藝欄). We were able to obtain works not only from established (旣成) writers, of course (勿論), but also from two up-and-coming writers among the newcomers (新人) who specifically won first prize in the New Year Literary Prizes (新春懸賞) of various newspapers.

★

At a time when there is absolutely no consideration (考慮) for how to provide opportunities and assistance for the further development of capable new writers (新人作家) who have once won an award (當選), it is highly significant (意義) that we have taken the initiative (率先) to create such a foundation (긔틀). We also sincerely hope for their brave efforts (健鬪) and steady hard work going forward.
-(Yi·Ch'a (李·車))-<106>

★

I (小生), who had been staying (滯留) in Shanghai (上海) for a long time carrying out the duties of this company's (本社) Shanghai Special Correspondent (上海 特派員), have now returned to Korea (朝鮮) again to learn more about various matters concerning our Chosŏn and to recover (回復) my lost health, and have come to work in the company's editorial department (本社 編輯局). With my meager strength, it will likely be impossible (到底) to meet the expectations of all you readers, but I intend to strive hard (奮鬪) with all the sincerity (情誠) and strength I possess. I earnestly await much loving care (愛護) and support (援助), both directly and indirectly (直接間接). (Kang No-hyang (姜鷺鄕))

**Summary**

This editorial postscript from the March 1935 issue of *Kaebyŏk* explains the reasons for its delayed publication as a combined February-March issue, attributing it to time constraints, the arrest of a colleague named Hwaewŏl, staff health issues, and the special focus on criticizing contemporary newspapers. It introduces Kang Sŏng-gu (pen name Kang No-hyang) as a returning Shanghai correspondent joining the editorial team. The editors express pride in the literature section, featuring established writers and two recent winners of major newspaper literary prizes, highlighting *Kaebyŏk*'s initiative in supporting new talent. Kang No-hyang adds a personal note about his return and commitment.

From a historical perspective, the article reveals the operational challenges faced by Korean magazines under Japanese colonial rule, including the political risk suggested by Hwaewŏl's arrest ("a certain incident"). The explicit theme of newspaper criticism, despite acknowledging the "unfavorable environment," indicates a desire within the Korean intellectual sphere to hold media accountable, even under censorship. The mention of supporting new literary talent underscores the importance of cultural production and nurturing national identity during this period. The return of a correspondent from Shanghai might also hint at the broader networks and concerns connecting Koreans at home and abroad.

編輯餘墨
이번 號는 特히  『新聞批判號』로 꿈엿다. 自稱 民衆의 公器요, 社會의 木鐸이라는 現 新聞은 비록 環境의 不利한 地位에 잇다할지라도 너무나 우리들의 期待에 어그러지는 일이 많은 것은 一般이 共通으로 가장 痛歎해 마지안는 바이다. 이때에 우리는 微誠이나마 民意를 대신하야 新聞紙 改善을 切實이 要求促進하고 同時에 一般에게 新聞智識의 普及을 期하는 意味에서 이번 號를 特히 이렇게 編輯한 것이다.
