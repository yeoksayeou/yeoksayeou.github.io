Urgent Notice

The 500 Won Grand Prize Contest commemorating the continued publication of this magazine (本誌), announced in the previous December issue (十二月號), could not be announced in this month's issue. This is because the February issue (二月號) could not be published on time due to unavoidable circumstances (不得한 事情) and came out as a combined February-March issue (二三月號). Consequently, the announcement has been postponed to the April issue (四月號). We respectfully inform all applicants (應募 諸氏) and beloved readers (愛讀 者러분) of this and express our deepest apologies (深謝).

**Summary**

This brief notice from the Editorial Department announces the postponement of the results for a 500 Won prize contest, originally scheduled for the current issue. The delay is attributed to unavoidable circumstances that prevented the timely publication of the February issue, necessitating a combined February-March issue. The announcement is rescheduled for the April issue, and the editors apologize to applicants and readers. For historians, this notice reflects the operational challenges (publication delays cited as "unavoidable circumstances") faced by Korean publications like *Kaebyŏk* under Japanese colonial rule. The mention of a significant 500 Won prize also points to efforts by the magazine to engage readers and potentially indicates its scale or ambition despite the difficult environment.
