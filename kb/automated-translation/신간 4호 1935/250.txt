(An Anecdote about Excavating Actual Objects/Treasure)

The famous Cocos Island (코코스島) in Central America (中央亞米利加) — this is an isolated island (孤島) located three hundred miles (三百哩) southwest (西南) of Costa Rica (코스타리카國), and here lies sixty million dollars worth of actual treasure (實物) said to have been buried (埋藏) by pirates (海賊) in the Middle Ages (中世時代).

Countless (不知其數) exploration teams (探險隊) have coveted this until today (今日), and recently (最近) another small British (英國) ship of about six hundred tons (六百噸) made a dash (突進) towards Cocos Island. Unfortunately, due to bad luck (運), it was detained (押留) by Costa Rican police officers (警官), leading to a tricky problem (問題). However, [due to British intervention/discussion - unclear text ■■■], it was [resolved peacefully - unclear text 無事■■].

The ownership (所有權) of this buried treasure (賣物 - likely 埋物) had been unclear (■■■ - likely 不明) until now (至今), but it seems that recently (最近) Costa Rica's ownership has finally been acknowledged (認定). Therefore, it is said that an actual object excavation company (實物發掘會社) has been established (■■ - likely 設立) again (■시 - likely 다시).<73>

**Summary**

The article reports on the enduring legend of pirate treasure buried on Cocos Island, off the coast of Costa Rica. It mentions a recent incident where a British expedition attempting to find the $60 million treasure was detained by Costa Rican authorities but was eventually resolved. The piece concludes by noting that Costa Rica's ownership of the potential treasure has now been recognized, leading to the re-establishment of an excavation company. For historians studying Korean colonial history, this article shows an awareness of international affairs and popular adventure stories (like treasure hunting) among the Korean readership in the 1930s, offering a glimpse into the kind of foreign news and narratives that circulated during that period, possibly serving as escapism or reflecting global trends.
