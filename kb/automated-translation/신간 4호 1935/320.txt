Brief Comments on the Financial World
						Kang Ch'on-saeng (江村生)

Debt Even for the Unborn Child

A glance at the total public debt related to Korean projects reveals that the amount of new public bonds issued in the 10th year (of Shōwa, 1935) is said to be 24 million wŏn. The breakdown shows 749,651,680 wŏn for the general account and 14,500,000 wŏn for the special account. Given this, even if we consider the current total population of Chosŏn to be 23 million and allocate an average of one wŏn per person, it only amounts to 23 million wŏn. The burden of the shortfall of one million wŏn must inevitably be shouldered even by fetuses (胎兒) not yet born into the world. Truly, the people of Chosŏn seem destined to carry debt from their mother's womb. Even without having used it in their already poor (貧寒) livelihoods, this debt increases year after year. Is this not truly being doubly burdened, inside and out ("꼽사등")?

Farm Household Income Increases, Numerically Speaking

According to reports, the situation of joint cotton (棉花) sales last year reached 50.06 million kŭn (斤), an increase of about 20% compared to the 46 million kŭn of the year before last. The value also reached 8 million wŏn, an increase of 2.2 million wŏn compared to the 5.8 million wŏn of the year before last. Furthermore, the price of rice increased by 30-40% (while grain prices fell (穀價)), and other agricultural products (農産物) also all showed sharp increases (激增) compared to the previous year. Land prices (地價), depending on the region, surged (暴騰) by up to 50-60%. Looking only at these surface numbers, it is lauded that the economic conditions (景氣) of Chosŏn's rural villages have somewhat improved (好轉) and the income of general farm households has increased. However, does the farmers' livelihood truly correspond to the surface economic conditions?

-(Excerpt)-

As most land and agricultural products belong to the wealthy class (富裕階級) and the privileged class (特權層), that income also flows to them. No matter how much farm household income is said to have increased according to surface numbers, are the poor commoners (細窮民) still not without even millet rice (粟飯) and reduced to [eating] grass roots and tree bark (草根木皮)?

Unjust Self-Management Plan

The general meeting of the Rice Policy Investigation Committee (米穀對策調査會) was held on the 19th. The subcommittee proposal (小委員會案), decided by the special committee on the 15th, was approved along with its supplementary resolution (附帶決議). Based on this, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (農林省) authorities are said to be organizing the clauses and submitting them to the Diet in early February. However, it is said that the so-called Rice Self-Management Plan (米穀自治管理案), which aims at controlling Korean rice (朝鮮米), will be decided with the unfair regulation setting the control allocation ratio (管理 配定量) finally at 3.8 (Japan mainland - 日本內地) to 6.2 (overseas territories - 外地). As the fate of Korean rice is thus subjected to discriminatory treatment (差別取扱) to such an extent, the Chosŏn side, surprised by the sudden worsening of the situation, has reportedly established the Association for Promoting Korean Rice Exports (朝鮮米穀移出期成會) and launched an opposition movement. This issue arises every year during the new grain season (新穀期), to the point where one is sick of hearing about it. Before their masters change, no matter how many millions of words of opposition are listed, things will only turn out as they will. However, if this ratio is implemented, the controlled quantity (統制數量) will be 3.15 million sŏk (石) for the Japan mainland, 3.96 million sŏk for Chosŏn, and 1.89 million sŏk for Taiwan (臺灣), placing an excessively heavy burden only on Chosŏn. According to the previously rumored ratio based on a 5:5 principle <84>, it would be slightly less than 35% for the Japan mainland, i.e., 4.5 million sŏk, and slightly less than 37% for Chosŏn, i.e., 3 million sŏk. Chosŏn cannot accept such discriminatory treatment that reverses the situation, and its impact will be extremely significant. Furthermore, there is an item stating that the calculation of the controlled quantity will be based on the increasing trend of rice export volume outside the jurisdiction (管外移出) over the past ten years. This is also an extremely disadvantageous and unfair condition for Korean rice. Rice moved outside the jurisdiction is estimated at roughly 13 million sŏk for the Japan mainland and 8 million sŏk for Chosŏn. Since Japanese rice production has already reached a saturation point, its increase rate is minimal, but Chosŏn still shows dynamic growth. Therefore, if this is used as the standard, the allocation for controlling Korean rice will exceed the ratio. Moreover, in Chosŏn, where drought and flood damage (旱水害) frequently occur, there is no guarantee that control will not be enforced according to the established allocation even in years when the export potential is significantly reduced, or that an abnormal situation where export volume becomes zero will not arise in extreme cases. The entire lifeline (全生命線) of Chosŏn's economy, no, the economy of the Korean people, is "rice." If things turn out this way, the economic collapse (經濟破綻) of Chosŏn's rural villages is as clear as looking at fire (明若觀火), and everyone recognizes that its derivative effects will be immense. They frequently advocate for non-discrimination, but it is a fact that when it comes to greed and guaranteeing the right to survival, that advocacy is not practiced. However, this too is brought about (招來) by special circumstances, so who can be blamed for what?

Chosŏn Gold Production Amount Reaches 100 Million Wŏn

Flush! Flush! This is the new symbol of Chosŏn this year. Shōwa 10 (1935) Chosŏn is characterized by the abnormal state of the gold mining world (産金界). Chosŏn's gold mine fever (金鑛熱) expands year after year, and applications (出願) and production increase, showing truly astonishing numerical expressions (數字的 表現). According to the Government-General (總督府) Mining Division's (鑛山課) investigation, the number of applications for various mines, which was 5,210 in the year before last, jumped to 9,200 last year, approaching 10,000. The total production value of various minerals was 48.3 million wŏn the year before last, of which the gold production amount (金産額) was 29,394,446 wŏn. Last year, gold production alone is said to have surpassed the 70 million wŏn mark (七千萬圓臺를 突破하였다). Therefore, if we estimate this year's gold production amount considering the completion of future facilities (設備의 完成) and gold smuggling prevention measures (金密輸 防止策), it is said that it will break the 100 million wŏn mark (一億圓臺를 突破). (Nine lines omitted here)

Rapid Increase in Imports of Various Miscellaneous Grains

Last year's trade volume (貿易額) for Chosŏn is said to have been 985,163,000 wŏn, far surpassing the previous record high of 779,960,000 wŏn from Shōwa 3 (1928). Total exports (輸移出總額) were 465,367,000 wŏn, and total imports (輸移入總額) were 519,796,000 wŏn. Looking briefly at important items and prices, among exports, rice and unhulled rice, fish products, cotton textiles, iron, and timber showed definite increases. Important imported goods include millet (粟), beans/pulses (頭類), salt (鹽), tobacco (煙草), coal (石炭), and timber. Among these, the most surprising is Manchurian millet (滿洲粟), which reached 1,423,198 sŏk valued at 15,736,957 wŏn, being the highest. Besides millet, the import of so-called miscellaneous grains such as proso millet (黍), sorghum (高粱), corn (玉蜀黍), and barley (大麥) shows definite dominance. What does it signify that the import of miscellaneous grains holds such dominance in the total trade volume? The living conditions (生活狀態) of the Korean people can be inferred from this. Is it truly the fate of Koreans to be unable to survive without millet rice (粟飯) and miscellaneous grains? <85><84-85>

**Summary**

This 1935 article by Kang Ch'on-saeng critiques the economic situation in colonial Chosŏn. It highlights the immense public debt burden, questioning official statistics showing increased farm income by pointing out that wealth (land, agricultural profits) is concentrated among the privileged, leaving poor farmers reliant on basic grains. The author strongly opposes the proposed discriminatory rice control plan favoring Japanese mainland producers over Korean ones, predicting economic disaster for Korean agriculture. Despite this gloom, the article notes a booming gold rush and record trade volume, but points out the concerning increase in imported miscellaneous grains (millet, sorghum, etc.) from Manchuria, suggesting worsening living standards for ordinary Koreans who increasingly rely on cheaper grains instead of rice.

For historians, this article offers a valuable contemporary perspective on the economic realities and discontent in colonial Korea. It reveals the perceived unfairness of Japanese economic policies (especially rice controls), the concentration of wealth despite surface prosperity indicators, the impact of the global gold boom on Korea, and the changing dietary patterns reflecting economic hardship (shift from rice to cheaper imported grains), providing data points and commentary on debt, agriculture, mining, trade, and social stratification under colonial rule. The author's critical tone and use of terms like "discriminatory treatment" are also significant.
