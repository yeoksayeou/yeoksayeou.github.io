Newspaper Gossip
…Hello… Is that Mr. Chŏng Ku-chung’s hospital? I heard President Song was injured and hospitalized; is it very serious? Can I visit him if I go now?… Yes, yes… No particular injuries, just a fractured clavicle. Visits are not refused, please come…
★
This is a verbatim record of a telephone conversation between a certain kisaeng and someone at Mr. Chŏng Ku-chung’s hospital. President Song met with an unexpected misfortune right at the start of the New Year. The facts were reported in detail in a certain newspaper, so I won't repeat them here.
★
However, a certain literary figure, upon hearing the news of Mr. Song's injury, became greatly indignant and said, "How could the president of the principled and noble Tong-a Ilbo, which absolutely refuses to publish writings by authors who contribute to the 'Maeil Sinbo' (每申) in its own newspaper or magazines, disgracefully get injured while chasing the tails of Maeil Sinbo Vice President Yi Sang-hyŏp, National Association (國民協會) General Secretary Cho Pyŏng-sang and his associates (等人), and among them, Kim Kwang-sŏng (金鑛成), Kim Ka (金家), and Ch'oe Ch'ang-hak, who receive much unwelcome praise from many people! If the Tong-a Ilbo is indeed as principled and noble a newspaper as it presents itself, the company should naturally demand Mr. Song's resignation this time," he declared… To say such things when someone is injured seems a bit harsh, but the point itself sounds plausible.
★<86>
The Chosŏn Ilbo Company purchased an airplane at the start of the New Year. As the company boasts, it is truly an unprecedented, great undertaking in the history of the Korean press.
★
However, it is doubtful whether Korean newspapers yet have any use for employing an airplane. Fortunately, or rather unfortunately, if there were a flood disaster in the three southern provinces like last year, they might fly to Taegu to stay overnight, or else, like tossing snacks to monkeys at the zoo (動物園), they could drop pieces of dry bread from the air to the disaster victims (罹災民) and then advertise in the newspaper, claiming they provided relief to the victims. But if there are no such events, I worry it might become a useless thing (無用之長物). If they were going to spend money anyway, it seems more necessary to establish a newspaper company library (圖書館) or perhaps send reporters to study abroad to cultivate great newspaper journalists, rather than buying an airplane.
★
After the Chosŏn Ilbo ran an editorial on the evils of keeping concubines (蓄妾), the Chosŏn Chungang Ilbo then ran an editorial stating that keeping concubines is the root of ruining a family (敗家). I don't know if the presidents at Chosŏn and the vice president and editor-in-chief elders (令監) at Chungang ordered such editorials to be written to warn the general populace based on their own experiences (體驗), but if the editorial writers wrote them voluntarily, they are truly bold and fair journalists. However, they will surely incur the strong dislike of the newspaper leadership, so for the sake of their future positions (處身), it would probably be better not to write (更不作) such editorials hereafter.
★
Speaking of the editor-in-chief (編輯局長), the competition among the various companies these days is quite a spectacle, but the jostling for seats among the presidents themselves at any gathering is also quite a sight. President Song, considering himself the veteran president of the newspaper world and unsurpassed socially, customarily sits in the highest seat. President Pang, finding it embarrassing to sit second, strives to arrive before the scheduled time, that is, before President Song arrives, to occupy the top seat. However, President Yŏ, who doesn't fuss over trivial matters (不拘小事), takes whatever seat is available…
★
But there was one amusing incident. Sometime ago, Yŏnhŭi College (延禧專門) invited the three presidents. Somehow, it happened that Mr. Yŏ was seated highest, Mr. Song next, and Mr. Pang in the lowest seat. Mr. Pang considered this a great insult and, in great indignation (大憤慨), exclaimed, "How could those people treat someone like that!" When he related this fact, a certain executive, perhaps to curry favor with President Pang, expressed even greater indignation and fury, saying, "Yes, those insolent fellows! How dare they treat our great newspaper company worse than that minor newspaper!" The president's office was in an uproar for a while, and it almost seemed that if there were any secret scandals at Yŏnhŭi College, they would retaliate on the spot with the power of the pen. Fortunately, the editor-in-chief intervened, arguing (代辯) that it wasn't for any other reason; Mr. Yŏ was given the first seat to interact directly with Westerners since he is fluent (通) with them, and Mr. Song was seated next because he has more acquaintances (知面), questioning whether any discrimination could have been intended. Only then did President Pang's anger somewhat subside (稍解), or so the story goes (云云).<87>

**Summary**

This gossip column from March 1935 discusses recent events and rivalries within the Korean newspaper world. It mentions the injury of Song Chin-u (Tong-a Ilbo president) and criticism linking his injury to associating with figures connected to the pro-Japanese Maeil Sinbo. It mocks the Choson Ilbo's purchase of an airplane as potentially useless and suggests investing in a library or journalist training instead. The column satirizes editorials against concubinage published by Choson Ilbo and Choson Chungang Ilbo, hinting they might stem from the personal experiences of the newspapers' executives. Finally, it humorously describes the intense rivalry and sensitivity regarding seating arrangements among the presidents of Tong-a Ilbo (Song Chin-u), Choson Ilbo (Pang Ŭng-mo), and potentially Choson Chungang Ilbo (Yŏ Un-hyŏng), illustrated by an anecdote from Yŏnhŭi College.

From a historical perspective, the article offers intriguing glimpses into the competitive and politically sensitive environment of the major Korean private newspapers under Japanese colonial rule. The mention of Song Chin-u's association with Maeil Sinbo figures and the ensuing criticism highlight the internal pressures and nationalist expectations placed upon Korean cultural elites. The discussion of the airplane purchase and the critique of concubinage editorials reveal contemporary social debates and the newspapers' attempts at relevance or perhaps hypocrisy. The detailed account of the presidents' seating squabbles underscores the personal pride and intense rivalry among the leaders of these influential institutions, reflecting their perceived status within colonial society.

新聞漫談
…여보십쇼… 거긔가 鄭求忠 氏 病院입닛가 宋 社長이 負傷 入院하셧다니 過히 重傷이니 안이신가요 지금 가면 面會할 수 있을가요… 네네… 別無傷處에 鎖骨이 破折임니다 面會는 謝絶치 안으니, 오십쇼……
★
이것은 어떤 妓生이 鄭求忠 氏 病院 사람과 電話로 問答하던 말을 그대로 쓴 것이다 宋 社長은 新年劈頭에 意外 橫厄을 當하얏다. 그 事實은 某 新聞에 자서이 發表되였으니 새삼스럽게 더 말치 안으랴한다.
★
그런데 어떤 文人은 宋氏의 負傷하였다는 所聞을 듯고 憤慨 大憤慨하야 曰 『每申』에 글을 쓰는 文人의 글은 絶對로 自己네 新聞이나 雜誌에 실지 안는 그 節操잇고 高潔한 東亞日報社長으로 엇지하야 每申 副社長 李相協, 國民協會 總務 曺秉相 ■人과 같이 其中에도 여러 사람에게 반갑지 안은 稱讚을 만히 밧는 金鑛成 金家 崔昌學의 꽁문이를 쪼차다니다가 昌皮하게 負傷까지 하엿누! 東亞日報가 自己네 自處하는 것과 같이 果然 節操가 잇고 高潔한 新聞이라면 그 社에서 이번에 當然히 宋氏의 辭職을 식힐것이라 하더라고…… 남이 負傷까지 한데 그런 말을 하는 것은 좀 甚한 듯하나 말인즉 그럴듯
★＜86＞
朝鮮日報社에서는 新年劈頭에 飛行機를 購入하였다 그 社에서 자랑하는 것과 같이 참으로 朝鮮新聞界 初有의 長擧다.
★
그런데 朝鮮의 新聞에서 아즉 飛行機 使用할일이 있을는지 그것이 疑問이다 多幸이 안이 不幸이 昨年과 같은 三南水災나 있다면 大邱에나 가서 留宿을 하던지 그럿치 안으면 動物園 원숭이에게 菓子던지 주듯이 罹災民에게 마른 빵쪼각이나 空中에서 던저주고 曰 罹災民 救濟하엿다고 新聞으로 宣傳이라도 하겟지만은 그런 일도 없다면 無■의 長物이 되지 안을가 念慮이다. 이왕 돈을 쓴다면 飛行機보다도 新聞社 ■■■書■을 設立하던지 그렇지 안으면 記者를 外國에 留學식혀 大新聞記者 養成을 식히는 것이 더 必要할듯.
★
朝鮮日報에서 蓄妾의 弊害란 社說을 쓰더니 朝鮮 中央에서 또 蓄妾은 敗家의 本이란 社說을 썼다 朝鮮에서는 社長 中央에서는 副社長, 編輯局長 令監들이 體驗한 結果 一般民衆에 警戒하너라고 그런 社說을 쓰라고 命令하였는지 모르거니와 만일 論說記者가 自發로 그 社說을 썻다면 그야말로 大膽한 記者요 公正한 記者다 그러나 新聞 首腦者에게 톡톡한 미움을 바들터이니 此後 更不■ 그런 社說이 處身 上 조흘듯.
★
■■■長말이 낫스■ 말이지 요새에 各 社의 競爭하는 것도 볼만하거니와 어떤 座席이던지 社長끼리 座席 다툼하는 것도 또한 可觀이다 宋 社長은 自己가 新聞界의 元老社長이요 社會로도 以上의 人物이 없거니 하고 依例 上席에 안고 方 社長은 其次에 안는 것이 昌皮하야 定刻 以前 卽 宋 社長오기 前에 먼저 出席하야 上席을 차지하너라고 애를 쓴다 그러나 不拘小事하는 呂 社長은 되는대로 席次를 차지……
★
그런데 한 가지 우서운 일이 있었다 언제인가 延禧專門에서 三社長을 招請하엿는데 엇지 그리되엿던지 呂氏가 最上 其次가 宋氏 末席이 方氏엿는데 方氏는 그것을 큰 侮辱으로 생각하고 ■■憤慨 曰 그 사람들이 남의 待接을 그렇게 하는 수가 잇나하고 그 事實을 말하니 某 幹部는 方 社長의 비위를 맛치더라도 더 一層 憤慨怒叱 曰 그래 그놈들이 고약한 놈들이지 우리 大新聞社를 그까진 所新聞보다 待接을 못하게 한단 말이냐고 하야 社長室이 한참 떠들석하야 하마하더면 延專의 秘密內幕이라도 무엇이 잇다면 當場에 붓의 威力으로 報復을 하게 될 번하얐으나 다행이 編輯局長이 代■하되 그것은 다른 까닭이 안이라 呂氏는 西洋人 通이닛가 西洋人과 直接 交際를 식키기 爲하야 첫자리를 주고 宋氏는 知面이 더 만흐닛가 그런 것이지 무슨 差別을 하였겟는냐고 하니 그제야 方 社長의 怒氣가 稍解 云云＜87＞
