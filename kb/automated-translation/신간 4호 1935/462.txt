The March issue, the continuation of "Ŏrini" (『어린이』), was unfortunately seized by the authorities (當局).

Therefore, we unavoidably cannot publish the March issue and will instead publish it as the April issue. We hereby respectfully announce this.<107>

**Summary**

This brief notice from the magazine "Kaebyŏk Sin'gan" informs readers that the March issue of the children's magazine "Ŏrini" was confiscated by the authorities. Consequently, the March issue will not be published, and its contents will be included in the April issue instead. This notice is historically significant as it explicitly records an instance of Japanese colonial censorship targeting a Korean publication, specifically a magazine aimed at children. For historians, it exemplifies the control and suppression exerted by the colonial authorities over Korean media and cultural expression during the 1930s.
