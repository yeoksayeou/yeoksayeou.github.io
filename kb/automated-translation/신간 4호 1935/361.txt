**Summary**

This is a special announcement from the Kaebyŏk magazine's editorial office, published on March 1, 1935. It lists six planned articles and their authors that could not be included in issue number 4 due to "unavoidable circumstances." The magazine apologizes to both the writers and the readers for this omission. From a historical perspective, the phrase "unavoidable circumstances" (不得已한 事情) during the Japanese colonial period almost certainly indicates censorship or pressure from the authorities that prevented the publication of these potentially critical articles about the press and related incidents. This notice serves as evidence of the strict control and limitations imposed on Korean media during that era.
