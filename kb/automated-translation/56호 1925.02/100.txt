流言蜚語 (Rumors and Slanders)

A Grand Welcome Party
This is a slightly old story. At the end of last year, amidst the so-called administrative reorganization storm, Mr. Yi Chin-ho fortunately became the Director of the Bureau of Education, Mr. Yi Pŏm-ik became the Director of the Internal Affairs Department, and Messrs. Sŏk Chin-hyŏng and Pak Yŏng-ch'ŏl were promoted to Provincial Governors. Certain propertied and knowledgeable gentlemen in Kyŏngsŏng, skilled in currying favor and flattery, were brimming with joy as if Korea had gained some OO [censored/unclear word] or Koreans had encountered some good fortune of rebirth. They chased after each other, offering congratulations, and held a welcome party at Siktowŏn (initiated by Han Sang-nyong and others). The participants numbered over 100, making it an unprecedentedly grand success. While the welcome party was indeed a success, it is said that among the so-called congratulatory speeches and expressions of sentiment exchanged between hosts and guests, there were particularly many strange tales.

First off, the elder Yi Sang-jae, president of the Chosŏn Ilbo, representing the initiators, delivered his characteristic witty remarks, saying things like, "Today's gathering is a watchful one," and "The Director of the Bureau of Education and the Provincial Governors have heavy responsibilities, so gentlemen, be especially prudent in your duties," and "From now on, there is brightness in the future for Koreans too." He gave an ambiguous speech that was part congratulation, part admonition. Next, Mr. Yi Chin-ho, as if he had become a Prime Minister<46> himself, said, "I had given up on an official career and intended to retire to the countryside, but unexpectedly receiving the Great Mandate (大命), I obtained the glorious position of Director of the Bureau of Education. The immensity of Heavenly Grace (天恩) goes without saying, and this is not just my personal glory but the glory of all Koreans," and so on. Following him, Mr. Yang Chae-ch'ang, secretary (?) to Mr. Han Sang-nyong, flaring his upturned nose, as small as a water pipe opening, began designating certain individuals to share their sentiments, which likely led to even more side-splitting remarks. First, Mr. Sŏk Chin-hyŏng, famous as the "turkey" councilor, who had suddenly leaped to become the new governor of South Ch'ungch'ŏng Province (since the provincial office is in Kongju, perhaps he'll become a "peacock"), popped up. Perhaps thinking it was a reading of his own resume, he spoke at length about his career history, then interpreted a eulogy for Mr. Han Sang-nyong, and stated that as he was now responsible for the 1.7 million people of South Ch'ungch'ŏng (actual population under 1.16 million), his responsibility was great, and so on. Next, Mr. Yi Pŏm-ik, Director of the Internal Affairs Department of Hwanghae Province, also spoke, saying, "Despite the Japan-Korea annexation being for the happiness of both the Japanese and Korean peoples, since the annexation, Koreans were not appointed to high official positions, leading to many complications between the two peoples. Now, with the great decisive action (大英斷) of the Governor-General in reorganizing the administration and appointing Koreans up to Director of the Bureau of Education or Director of Internal Affairs, the nation's hundred-year plan (百年大計) is now established," and so on. Mr. Yun Ch'i-ho, famous for being clever and adept at navigating the world, reportedly said, "If I had known it would be like this, I wouldn't have attended." Ah, truly grand and praiseworthy they are. <47>

Not Bureau Director (局長), but Director of Hardship (困長)
Since Mr. Yi Chin-ho's name came up, let's add one more word. His becoming Director of the Bureau of Education is, as he says, an honor, but in reality, his income has decreased by 2,000 won per year compared to when he was living comfortably off his allowance as an advisor to the Oriental Development Company (東拓) and his pension (恩給). On top of that, his social expenses are high, so they say he's not a Bureau Director (국장 - Kukchang) but a Director of Hardship (곤장 - Konjang). Isn't this a case of worrying about the jade ornamental hatpin while sitting on a thorny cushion (別惡 堂上)? Instead, Mr. Yi Kyu-wan, Governor of South Hamgyŏng Province, hit the jackpot by becoming an advisor to the Oriental Development Company, and his income seems substantial. As a frugal and diligent worker, having become an advisor to the ODC, if he obtains much of the ODC's tenant land and farms well, he should be able to satisfy his own personal needs (口腹).

Principal Also Equal to a Councilor
Mr. Ko Wŏn-hun, former principal of Posŏng College (普成專門學校), became a Chŏlla Provincial Councilor (參與官), and the new principal is Mr. Yu Sŏng-jun, former Kyŏnggi Provincial Councilor. Looking at it this way, it seems a private professional school is equivalent to a Provincial Councilor of the Government-General of Korea (朝鮮総督府 道參與官). By the way, rumor has it that Mr. Yu campaigned for the Director of the Bureau of Education position this time but failed and became the principal of Posong College instead. Only the characters "Bureau" (局) and "School" (校) are different; the characters for "Study/Learning" (學) and "Chief/Head" (長) are the same.

Pity the Fox Tail (狐尾可惜)
While speaking of Mr. Yu, let's add another thing. – Mr. Yi Sang-jae's winter hat, resembling a goblin mask with two drooping ears, and Mr. Yu Sŏng-jun's fox fur scarf (狐皮 목돌이) are a peculiar sight in Kyŏngsŏng's Pukch'on during winter. However, at the beginning of the year, while Mr. Yu was returning from visiting someone at the Oriental Development Company, some pickpocket thief <48> stylishly cut off the fox tail (여흐 꽁지) wrapped around his neck and ran off. It's fortunate that Mr. Yu's neck wasn't cut, but to suddenly lose the fox tail that had accompanied him for many years during his time currying favor (納婿) in official circles is truly a pity for him.

Artist (藝術家) or Filth Artist Selling Herself (穢術嫁)?
Yun Sim-dŏk, who for a while received public acclaim as a female musician in Kyŏngsŏng during her prime, recently became the beloved mistress of the wealthy Mr. Yi Yong-mun of Naksan. She even set up household (設産) in a large house in Hwanggŭmjŏng. However, as the saying goes, "Beautiful pines have ever been ill-fated" (紅松自古多薄命), some trouble arose again, and within just over a month, they had a falling out. Yi took his concubine and went hunting towards Kangwŏn Province, while Yun took a small sum of money and bolted (뺑손이) to Harbin (哈爾賓). Whether Ms. Yun went to Harbin to trade opium, which Yi Yong-mun dearly loves to smoke, or whether she cut her hair short and went to get some Siberian (西伯爾亞) air out of anger, is unknown. In any case, Ms. Yun, like other artists, used to say that art knows no borders; it seems that when it comes to money, there's truly no distinction between wife and concubine. Is she an artist (藝術家 - yesulga) or a filth artist selling herself (穢術嫁 - yesulga)?

This Alone is a Victory for the Proletariat
Until last year, at the year-end and New Year, so-called gentlemen's year-end parties (망년회) and gentlemen's New Year gatherings (신년간친회) were held. Those with a bit of money in Kyŏngsŏng all pretended to be gentlemen, paying membership fees of 4-5 won and rushing to attend, creating great prosperity. But this year, it has become quiet as a mouse, completely subdued. Conversely, year-end and New Year gatherings on the side of the Proletariat (無産主義者) have been held here and there, achieving great success. From this alone, one can infer a new trend for the Proletariat. <49>
<46-49>

**Summary**

This satirical gossip column from 1925 critiques the behavior of prominent Korean figures within the Japanese colonial administration. It mocks the ostentatious welcome party held for newly appointed officials like Yi Chin-ho and Yi Pŏm-ik, highlighting their perceived sycophancy and inflated self-importance through quotes from their speeches. The article contrasts their "success" with underlying difficulties (like reduced income) or critiques their past actions. It also includes anecdotes about other figures like Yun Ch'i-ho, Yu Sŏng-jun, and the singer Yun Sim-dŏk, often laced with sarcasm about their status or misfortunes. Finally, it notes a shift in social gatherings, with elite "gentlemen's" parties declining while "proletarian" gatherings gain prominence, framing this as a "victory for the proletariat." For historians, this piece offers valuable insights into the social dynamics of colonial Korea, including the complex nature of collaboration, the criticism faced by elites perceived as pro-Japanese, the social commentary circulating in popular magazines, and the growing visibility of class consciousness and socialist/proletarian movements in the 1920s. The specific names, events, and sarcastic tone provide a vivid snapshot of contemporary attitudes towards the elite and social change.

流言蜚語
宏壯한 歡迎會
이것은 조곰 묵은 일이다. 작년 歲末 소위 행정정리바람에 요행이 李軫鎬君이 학무국장이 되고 李範益君이 내무부장이 되고 石鎭衡, 朴榮喆 兩君은 지사각하로 영전이 되얏는데 추세아부 잘하는 경성 내 有産, 有識의 某某 紳士들은 조선에 OO이나 되고 또 조선인이 무슨 갱생의 好運을 맛난듯이 喜氣滿滿하야 서로 쫏차 단이며 치하도 하고 환영회를 食道園 내에 개최하얏는데 (韓相龍 등 발기로) 참가자가 무려 100여인에 달하야 공전의 대성황을 이루웟다. 그런데 그 환영회는 성황이어니와 主客間에 서로 밧고 주고한 소위 축사와 감상담 중에는 별별의 奇談이 더욱 만핫다 한다.
벽두에 조선일보 사장 李商在 노인은 발기인측을 대표하야 氏의 독특한 괘사를 피워가며 「오날 이 좌석은 감시한 좌석이니」 또 「학무국장과 지방장관은 책임이 중대하니 諸君이 직무에 특별 신중이 하라」는 둥 「조선인도 今後부터 前途에 광명이 잇다」는 등 축사 겸 훈사 비슷한 요령부득의 말을 하고 其次에 李軫鎬君은 자기가 一 총리대신이나＜46＞ 한 듯시 「자기는 官界를 단념하 國고 江湖에 間養하럇더니 의외에 大命을 拜受하야 학무국장의 영광되는 지위를 엇게 되니 天恩의 망극은 물론이어니와 이것은 다만 자기 1인의 광영이 안이라 일반 조선인의 광영이라」 云云하고 그 뒤를 니여 韓相龍君의 비서(?) 梁在昶君이 水口門 구멍만한 들창코를 벌눙벌눙 하면서 某某人을 지정하야 감상담 시작을 하게 되는데 더욱 腰折할 말이 만핫겟다. 첫재에 칠면조 참여관으로 명성이 藉藉하다가 一躍하야 충남 신지사가 된(도청이 공주이닛가 孔雀은 딀 듯」 石鎭衡君이 쑥 나오더니 자기 이력서 낭독회인 줄 알엇던지 자기이력을 한참 말한 뒤에 韓相龍君의 송덕문을 또 해설하고는 자기가 금번에 충남 170만 인민 (실지 인구는 116만 미만)을 맛게 되얏스니 책임이 중대하다 云云하고 그 다음 황해도 내무부장 李範益君은 또 말하되 「日韓병합은 日韓 兩 민족의 행복을 위함에 불구하고 병합 이후 조선인을 고관에 등용치 안이하야 兩 민족간 허다의 層折이 만핫더니 今般 정무총감의 大英斷으로 행정을 정리하고 조선인을 학무국장 혹은 내무부장까지 임용하게 되얏스니 인제는 국가 백년대계가 확립되얏다 운운하고 꾀만코 행세 잘 하기로 유명한 尹致昊 얊�반은 「자기가 이럴 줄 알엿더면 출석쳐 안이 하엿겟다」고 하엿단다. 아- 참 굉장하고 갸륵들 하다.＜47＞

局長이 안이라 困長
李軫鎬君의 말이 낫스닛가 더 한 만듸 해보자. 君이 학무국장된 것은 君의 말과 가티 영광이지만은 사실 수입은 전일 東拓 고문으로 수당과 또 恩給을 臥食하던 때보다 년 2,000원이 감소되얏는데 게다가 교제비는 만코 해서 국장이 안이라 困長이란다. 此 소위 별악 堂上에 옥관자가 걱졍이 안인가. 그 대신에 咸南知事 李圭完君은 움안에 떡밧기로 東拓 고문이 되야 수입이 상당한 모양이다. 그 근검하고 실지 노동 잘 하는 사람으로 東拓 고문이 되얏스니 東拓의 소작토지나 만히 어더서 농업을 잘 하얏스면 자기 일신의 口腹은 충족할 것이다.

校長도 參與官同等
前普成專門學校長 高元勳君은 全羅참여관이 되더니 신임 교장은 前京畿道참여관 兪星濬氏다. 그러고 보면 사립전문학교도 조선총독부 道참여관과 동등은 되는 모양이다. 그런데 전설에 드르면 兪氏가 금번에 학무국장 운동을 하다가 낙방이 되고 보성전문학교장이 되얏단다. 「務局」과 「校」 字만 다를 뿐이지 學字 長字는 일반.

狐尾可惜
兪氏의 말을 하는 중에 또한 말하자.-李商在氏의 두 귀 축 처진 독갑이 탈 가튼 방한모와 兪星濬氏의 狐皮 목돌이는 겨을날 경성 북촌의 한 奇觀이다. 그런데 兪氏는 歲初에 東拓에 누구를 방문하고 오는 도중애서 엇던 「스리 도적이 맵시잇게＜48＞ 그의 목에 두른 여흐 꽁지를 잘너 갓단다. 氏가 목까지 짤리지 안은 것은 다행이지만은 다년간 氏가 官界에 納婿한 때에 동반하던 狐尾를 一朝에 盜失한 것은 참 氏을 위하야 可惜하다.

藝術家乎 穢術嫁乎
한참 당년에 京城 여류 음악가로 일반의 환영을 밧던 尹甚悳은 근래 駱山 부호 李容汶君의 애첩이 되야 黃金町 거대한 가옥에다 設産까지 하엿더니 紅松自古多薄命으로 또 무슨 사단이 생겨서 불과 月餘에 서로 섬마섬마 하야 李는 妓妾을 다리고 강원도 방면으로 수렵을 가고 尹은 약간의 금전을 어더가지고 哈爾賓으로 뺑손이를 첫단다. 尹氏가 哈爾賓에 간 것은 李容汶의 愛吸하는 아편무역을 하러 갓는지 또는 아주 단발을 하고 화김에 西伯爾亞 바람을 쐬려갓는지 알 수 업거니와 하여간 尹氏는 다른 예술가와 가티 역시 예술에는 국경이 업다 말하더니 금전에는 참 妻妾의 구별이 업는 모양이다. 예술가인지 穢術嫁인지.

이것만도 無産者의 勝利
一 작년까지도 歲末歲初인 소위 신사 망년회니 신사 신년간친회니 하고 경성내에 돈푼이나 잇는 자들은 모다 신사인 척하고 4,5원의 회비를 가지고 爭先 참석하야 대성황을 어루더니 금년에 와서는 쥐 죽은 듯시 아주 쑥 드러가고 그 반대로 無産主義者側의 망년회, 신년간친회가 處處에 개최되야 대성황을 이루웟다. 이것만도 無産者의 한 新氣運인 것을 가히 推知할 수 잇다.＜49＞
＜46-49＞
