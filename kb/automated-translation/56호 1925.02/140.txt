Approximately 83,000 Korean Compatriots Residing in Japan

According to an investigation by the authorities, the number of Koreans residing in Japan as of the end of December, year 12 (1923), was 67,336 males and 12,281 females, totaling 80,617 people. From January 1st to the end of December, year 13 (1924), those who traveled to Japan numbered 12,895, and those who returned [to Korea] numbered 10,073. These numbers of arrivals and returnees represent the cumulative total of individuals, including those persons who may have traveled multiple times. Therefore, considering the difference of 2,822 between arrivals and returnees as the net increase of those remaining in Japan might not be entirely accurate. However, since returning multiple times involves special circumstances and the number of such cases is extremely small, viewed broadly, the number of residents increased by about 2,500 to 2,600 last year, bringing the current actual number to approximately 83,000. Among these, about 12,300 to 12,400 were women.

Looking at the distribution of these compatriots, Ōsaka has the most with 23,635 people, followed by Fukuoka with 10,377, Hyōgo with 5,564, Tōkyō with 3,347, Kyōto with 4,144, and Yamaguchi with 5,131. Aichi, Hiroshima, and Hokkaidō each count over 2,700 people. The fewest are in Okinawa with 8 people and Fukui with 20. Prefectures with fewer than 100 people include Aomori, Tochigi, Chiba, Yamagata, and Miyagi.

Furthermore, looking at these individuals by occupation, there are 39 officials/managers (有史), 5 soldiers, 1,155 male students, 130 female students, 4,504 unemployed males, and 3,421 unemployed females. The rest are involved in fishing/marine industries (鮮業), various types of labor, commerce, miscellaneous jobs, etc. The number of those imprisoned (在監者) was 83 the year before last, but reportedly reached over 100 by the end of last year.<57>

**Summary**

This 1925 news report details the Korean population residing in Japan, estimated at approximately 83,000 by the end of 1924. It notes a net increase of around 2,600 from the previous year, based on arrival and return figures, while acknowledging potential inaccuracies due to multiple trips by individuals. The article highlights the geographical distribution, with Ōsaka having the largest concentration, followed by Fukuoka, Hyōgo, Yamaguchi, Kyōto, and Tōkyō. It also provides a partial breakdown by occupation, listing small numbers of officials, soldiers, and students, a significant number of unemployed individuals, and others in labor, commerce, and fishing/marine industries. The number of imprisoned Koreans is also noted to have increased.

For historians, this article provides valuable quantitative data on early Korean migration to Japan during the colonial period. The specific numbers, geographical distribution (showing concentration in industrial centers), and occupational breakdown (revealing large numbers in labor or unemployed categories) offer insights into the socio-economic conditions and patterns of movement of Koreans seeking opportunities or pushed out of Korea. The mention of imprisoned individuals also hints at social issues and potential discrimination faced by the Korean population in Japan.
