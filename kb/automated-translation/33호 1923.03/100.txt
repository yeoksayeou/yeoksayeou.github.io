**Chinese Poetry**

Untitled
Observing movement and stillness, both are empty.
Flowers bloom, leaves fall, not driven by the wind.
Why is it so hard to release the hand gripping the cliff's edge?
Suffering, making a life, crying out within a dream.
(Yoam, Prison Poem)

Composed on September 9th
Recalling last autumn, sick at home,
By the fence, yellow chrysanthemums were in full bloom.
This year, the small garden has no one to water it;
Surely, only withered roots and abundant weeds remain.
(Tongdong)

Self-Talk
Raising my head, I again see the Great Eastern Sky (Korea),
How fortunate that this year is an auspicious year.
After the sun and moon regain their light over Silla and Koryŏ (Korea),
Rivers and mountains rely on struggle near the Manchurian-Mongolian border.
A gentle wind reaches everywhere, flowers will soon bloom,
When fine rain comes, the willows seem to want eyes (buds).
With sincere hearts, let us mutually caution against future affairs,
Lest we fear the people of Yan may again attack Yan.
(Sŏkkye) <30>

**Summary**

This article presents three poems written in Classical Chinese (Hanja). The first, by Yoam from prison, reflects on the emptiness of phenomena and the difficulty of letting go of life's struggles, even when perceived as a dream. The second, by Tongdong, expresses nostalgia for a past autumn contrasted with the present neglect and decay of a home garden. The third, by Sŏkkye, looks towards a hopeful future for Korea ("Great Eastern Sky," "Silla and Koryŏ"), envisioning national restoration potentially involving struggle ("Manchurian-Mongolian border"), while cautioning against internal conflict ("Yan attacking Yan"). From a historical perspective, these poems, published on March 1st, 1923, offer valuable insights into the sentiments of Koreans during the Japanese colonial period: the suffering of imprisonment, longing for home and normalcy, nascent hope for independence following the March 1st Movement (implied by the "auspicious year" and restoration theme), and anxieties about the path forward, including the potential for internal division.

漢詩
失題
動靜觀來兩是空 花開葉落不由風
如何難放懸崖手 苦作生涯呌夢中
(如菴 獄中詩)

9月 9日 作
回憶前秋病在家 籬邊黃菊盛開花
今年小圃無人灌 應是殘根百草多
(同同)
自言
擧頭復見大東天, 何幸今年是吉年.
日月重光羅麗後, 江山依奮滿蒙邊.
和風到處花將發, 細雨來時柳欲眼.
誠心互戒將來事, 或恐燕人更伐燕.
(石溪同)＜30＞
