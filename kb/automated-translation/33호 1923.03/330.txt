All Things Are Dying
						Chŏng Yŏng-t’ae

Tick-tock tick-tock
Time is slicing away Life
Thump-thump-thump!
The Heart plays
a Marching Tune
towards the grave
Can it compare even to a mayfly?
On the line
of infinite time
Falling, then tragically sliced and dying, O person!
The Glory you boast of
The Honor you rejoice in
What are they all!

Tick-tock tick-tock
Without even taking a breath
Time is slicing all things
Thump-thump-thump! Thwack!
Flowing blood <23>
The place it enters
Ah, that is the grave!
Oh, look!
All things are dying—
The Sun, the Moon, the Stars, the Earth too
Oh, you too, I too, shall die!
Youth! (靑春)
With burning Passion and Ideals
The longed-for Tomorrow
Will now be mercilessly sliced by time
Youth! (靑春)
Are you sitting now, or standing?
If standing, walk quickly, quickly!
Before Tomorrow comes
Tick-tock tick-tock
Ah, the sound of merciless time
slicing all things—
Listen, bearing it deeply in mind!
—(1922. 2. 9)— <24>

**Summary**

This poem by Chŏng Yŏng-t'ae uses the sounds of a clock and heartbeat to depict time as a relentless force cutting down all life, including humans, glory, honor, and even celestial bodies. It emphasizes the inevitability of death, comparing human existence unfavorably even to the short life of a mayfly. The poem culminates in a direct address to "Youth," urging them to abandon passivity and act decisively before their time, passion, and ideals are consumed by the unstoppable march towards the grave. From a historical perspective, the poem reflects a profound sense of existential angst and the crushing weight of mortality. Published in *Kaebyŏk* magazine during the Japanese colonial period, the urgent call to youth to "walk quickly" before "Tomorrow comes" could be interpreted by historians as a subtle, perhaps coded, encouragement for the younger generation to awaken and strive against the oppressive circumstances or the perceived decay of the era, despite the overwhelming sense of inevitable decline conveyed by the poem's main theme.

온갓 것은 죽고 잇다

잭각똑닥잭각똑닥
때는 生命을 썰고 잇다
쿵쿵쿵!
心臟은 무덤에 가는
行進曲을 彈奏한다
蜉蝣에나 비할가
無窮의 때의
線 우에 떨어젓다가
悲慘케도 썰녀 죽는 사람이여
자랑하는 榮華
깃버하는 名譽
그 다- 무엇이냐!

잭각똑닥 잭각똑닥
숨도 쉬지 안코
때는 온갓 것을 썰고 잇다
쿵쿵쿵! 퍽퍽!
흘느는 피＜23＞
들어가는 곳
아아 그야 무덤인데!
오오 보아라
온갓 것은 죽고 잇다-
太陽도 달도 별도 따도
오오 너도 나도 죽으리로다!
靑春아!
타오르는 情熱과 理想으로
바라는 來日도
이제 때에게 無慘히 썰이라
靑春아!
너는 至今 안젓느냐 섯느냐?
서 잇스면 어서어서 걸어라!
明日이 오기 前에
잭각똑닥 잭각똑닥
아아 온갓 것을 썰고 잇는
저 無情한 때의 소리를
銘念하여 들으라!
