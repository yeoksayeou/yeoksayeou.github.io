Art of the Old Silla Period,
						Pak Chonghong
Herein, Silla refers to the Silla of the Three Kingdoms period, that is, Old Silla. Therefore, it holds a distinct boundary in art history from the Silla after unification, which received the influence of Tang culture.

Where the main range of the T'aebaek Mountain System is about to end in the southeast, there is the Hyŏnggang River flowing into Yŏngil Bay. In the plains where its upper tributaries converge, the people of the Six Villages once acclaimed a divine person and planned the great work of founding a nation. Thus, its path was naturally different from those who coveted the position of monarch through military merit or plunder and boasted of their power in establishing a state. Others ruled the country by force, but in Silla, the people submitted to its divine virtue (神德), and there were not a few people from neighboring states who came seeking transformation. It is said that the king, together with the queen, toured the Six Divisions, encouraging and supervising their work; when Mahan suffered the death of its king, some urged chastisement, citing past discourtesies, but he did not comply and instead dispatched an envoy to offer condolences; seeing an old woman suffering from hunger and cold, he took off his own clothes to cover her. He lamented that the invasion of neighboring bandits was due to his own lack of virtue, and that residing above, he failed to perceive the people's sentiments, which was his crime for not understanding their feelings. Although, due to the customs of the middle ancient period, class distinctions were not absent in general affairs, its political system was a unique form where the three surnames [Pak, Sŏk, Kim] succeeded each other, and accordingly, harmony between upper and lower classes was achieved. Consequently, even neighboring peoples who had invaded the state borders felt ashamed of themselves before this virtuous nation and returned home. Pyŏnhan surrendered, and Eastern Okchŏ presented fine horses. Alas! Where unrighteous weapons point, arrows and stones of resistance glare; where benevolent virtue of loving care emanates, is joyful coming and assimilation awaited? Even towards the spirits of deceased kings, reverence was shown by constructing massive tumuli, and in the first month of spring in the 3rd year of the second king, Namhae Wang, a shrine to the founder was established, where successive kings personally performed ancestral rites. Thus, since the Chinhan period, the innocent and simple life of the people allowed their aesthetic sentiments to be expressed in various fields. First, in music, numerous geniuses emerged. The hyŏn'gŭm and kayagŭm originated, new compositions were harmonized with rhythmic modes, and instruments like the pipa and samjuk (three bamboos) were already in use. The legendary jade flute (玉笛) of Silla is treasured and appreciated as a precious artifact even today. <1> While it received considerable state protection, considering that 80 ships carrying numerous musicians and various instruments were sent to offer condolences for the funeral of Emperor Ingyō of Fusang (Japan), and that various musical forms continued to emerge thereafter, the melodies that gently undulated through the air of the Silla capital on tranquil moonlit nights were indeed the expression of innate impulses praising the joy of transcending the mundane world. It can be said that the fresh artistic sprouts indeed set down deep roots here.

Regarding the relationship with Buddhism, it is said that a golden image (金像) from Wŏlchi (Yuezhi) arrived riding an iron bell and was enshrined at Yujŏm Temple on Kŭmgang Mountain, and that Queen Hŏ Hwangok, wife of King Suro of Kara Kingdom, brought a stone pagoda from the Western Regions. Unfortunately, aside from the fact that various small bronze Buddha statues in the Nŭngin Hall of Yujŏm Temple are relics from the Silla period, and that the name Kara resembles an Indian dialect, there is little to confirm this, so we await the discovery of reliable historical materials for verification. Even if these legends were true, their influence would likely have been limited to certain mountainous regions and probably died out midway. Therefore, based on historical records (史記), we consider the introduction by the śramaṇa (monk) Mukhcha (墨胡子) from Koguryŏ during the reign of King Nulchi as the beginning of Silla Buddhism, which formed the origin of Buddhist art. Afterwards, Buddhist teachings gradually spread, but the court council could not reach a decision until, astonished by the miracle of Ich'adon, they dared not destroy Buddhist affairs. The Samguk Sagi states:
(Passage omitted) All said, "Now we see monks with shaved heads and strange clothes, their discussions are bizarre and not the common way. If we tolerate this now, we fear there will be regrets later. Although we may face severe punishment, we dare not obey the decree." Ich'adon alone said, "What the ministers say now is wrong. Truly, only after there are extraordinary people can there be extraordinary events. Now I hear that Buddhism is profound and mysterious, I fear it cannot be disbelieved." The King said, "The words of the multitude are firm and cannot be broken. You alone speak differently; I cannot follow both." Consequently, he was handed over to the officials to be executed. As Ich'adon faced death, he said, "I am being executed for the Dharma. If the Buddha has divine power, there will surely be a strange sign upon my death." When he was beheaded, blood surged from the severed spot, its color white as milk. (End quote)
The following year, an order was issued prohibiting the taking of life, and both high and low took refuge in the Buddhist Dharma. As it flourished like the rising sun, Monk Pŏpkong became King Pŏphŭng, and Monk Pŏbun became King Chinhŭng. Consequently, magnificent temples were built, and miraculous Buddha images were cast, forming the splendid Buddhist art of Silla.

Furthermore, the abundant natural products sufficiently supplied materials, aiding the development of art. It was long known as the "Land of Gold" in the East, with fertile soil and gold production abundant as mud, making Western merchants forget to return home. It is certain that Silla inspired such desires for distant travel. It was called a treasure country (寶國) abundant in dazzling gold and silver colors, making the islanders of Fusang (Japan) unable <2> to suppress their envy. Considering the incessant sea raids that resulted, the civilization of Silla, which already used gold currency, can be inferred. Iron, famous since the Chinhan period, fine granite produced everywhere, and crystal from Kŭmo Mountain allowed for the casting of the great iron statues admired today in the Kyŏngsŏng Museum, the construction of magnificent stone walls and stupas (塔婆), and the polishing of burial goods that adorned the large-scale royal tombs.

As described above, due to the natural environment and national stability, their pure innate sentiments produced an even keener artistic impulse. The transmission of the great Buddhist Dharma provided a motive for their artworks to be expressed through diverse forms. Especially because obtaining good materials was easy, this land, traditionally only called the "Land of Gentlemen of the East Sea" (海東君子國) and seemingly rudimentary in civilization, was able to build Silla, the nation of art. Since its location in the southeast of the peninsula made communication with the continent somewhat less convenient than the other two of the Three Kingdoms, the rise of its culture was also inevitably slightly delayed. However, its outstanding talent spurred rapid progress, reaching a point where, even before the unification period, it was not without aspects superior to the others.

First. Architecture
Kyŏngju was the capital of Silla for a thousand years. After building a fortress and palace at the foot of Namsan Mountain, they hardly ever moved away from it. While this could be because the nation's strength prevented foreign invasions, it was also greatly due to the advantage of natural defenses on all sides and geographical excellence. This is unlike Koguryŏ or Paekche, which relocated frequently, making it difficult even today to definitively determine the locations of their old capitals. Consequently, since relics are rarely scattered far from the center of Kyŏngju, searching for research subjects is somewhat less difficult than in other cases. Regarding early architecture, the Samguk Sagi states:
(Founder King Hyŏkkŏse) 21st year, built the capital fortress (京城), named Kŭmsŏng (金城).
26th year, Spring, first month, constructed palace buildings in Kŭmsŏng.
As the ages are distant, their remains have returned to oblivion, making them difficult to imagine today. Only under the entry for King T'arhae in the Samguk Sagi is it recorded, "Ninth year, Spring, third month, the king at night heard the sound of a rooster crowing among the trees of Kerim west of Kŭmsŏng..." From this, we can guess it was located near the east side of Sirim (始林, later Kerim). The Tongguk Yŏji Sŭngnam states, "Kŭmsŏng is located four ri east of the administrative center (府東四里), built by the founder Hyŏkkŏse, an earthen fortress with a circumference of 1,407 ch'ŏk." Regarding Wŏlsŏng (月城), built later <3>, it says, "Located five ri southeast of the administrative center (府東南五里), built by King P'asa (娑婆王) in his 22nd year, named so because its shape resembles a half-moon, an earthen structure with a circumference of 3,023 ch'ŏk." Thus, we know Kŭmsŏng was located about 1 ri (old Korean measure) northwest of Wŏlsŏng. From this, we can infer that Wŏlsŏng, Manwŏlsŏng (滿月城) which was north of Wŏlsŏng, and Kŭmsŏng stood in a triangular arrangement (鼎在). Furthermore, we can imagine the magnificent grand palace architecture built correspondingly. The site of Wŏlsŏng still remains; facing Munch'ŏn stream to the south, it forms the shape of a half-moon, created by leveling a slightly elevated hill.
The Geography section (地理志) of the Samguk Sagi states:
From the time of the founder, they resided in Kŭmsŏng, but in later generations, they often resided in both Wŏlsŏngs (兩月城).
However, what deserves attention here are the mountain fortresses (山城), among which Myŏnghwal Mountain Fortress (明活山城) was repaired and temporarily occupied during the reign of King Chabi.

Ancient tombs are scattered countlessly at the eastern and western foothills, representing the most numerous and important relics. Many large ones exist, like Ponghwangdae south of the town, reaching nearly seven chang (丈) in height. However, those excavated to date are relatively small in scale, so thorough research must largely await the future. To outline the architectural style based on what has been published: it seems to have gradually changed from burials where a wooden coffin was placed without an outer coffin (槨), simply covered with piled stones (磧礫) and then overlaid with clay to prevent collapse, to a stage where an outer coffin was built with natural fieldstones, featuring a shallow and narrow entrance. However, considering that the tomb near Ponghwangdae, from which a pure gold crown and excellent horse trappings, along with pottery, jade items, glassware, etc., enough to fill dozens of boxes, were excavated—a tomb influenced by Buddhist art yet constructed with piled stones—it seems rather rudimentary compared to the ancient tombs of Koguryŏ or Paekche, which were meticulously built with large, water-polished granite blocks employing sophisticated designs.

Regarding Buddhist architecture, starting with Hŭngnyun Temple (興輪寺), which received Buddha relics (佛舍利) from Liang China, there were Yŏnghŭng Temple (永興寺), where King Chinhŭng's five consorts resided after becoming nuns; Hwangnyong Temple (皇龍寺), where Master Chajang lectured on the Bodhisattva precepts; and Punhwang Temple (芬皇寺), where Master Wŏnhyo compiled his commentary on the Avatamsaka Sutra (華嚴疏)—all existing in the Three Kingdoms period. However, the only extant structures are the three stories of Punhwang Temple Pagoda and its flagpole supports (幢竿支柱). (Correction: The statement in the general introduction that Punhwang Temple Pagoda was one of the Three Treasures of Silla was an error for Hwangnyong Temple Pagoda, corrected here.) The Samguk Sagi, under the entry for Queen Sŏndŏk, states:
Third year, Spring, first month, the era name was changed to Inp'yŏng. Punhwang Temple was completed.
It is presumed that this pagoda was also built around that time. Queen Sŏndŏk's 3rd year corresponds to King Mu of Paekche's 35th year. Thus, it was constructed concurrently with the Mirŭk Pagoda in Iksan, built during King Mu's reign, making them jointly the oldest extant pagodas in Korea. According to legend, it originally had nine stories, but Japanese soldiers destroyed three during the Imjin War (壬辰亂), and subsequent clumsy repairs by temple monks further damaged three more, leaving the currently remaining <4> three stories. However, when authorities renovated it some years ago, a stone coffer (石函) was discovered inside the pagoda, containing numerous treasures, notably including gold coins minted in the Koryŏ period. Thus, it is known that it was also renovated during the Koryŏ era. Therefore, the Punhwang Temple Pagoda we see today is not the one built by the Silla people but one that has undergone several reconstructions based on the original form. Indeed, the recent unreasonable renovation has made it impossible even to appreciate this single remaining stone pagoda. Who, looking at the bald top of the third story, can recall the nine-story pagoda that once aspired to touch the heavens? Who, seeing the pagoda body smeared with ugly lime plaster, can feel the beauty of the somber and mysterious andesite (安山巖)? We suspect that this, in fact, constitutes the destruction, from an artistic value perspective, of even the three stories remaining from the third round [of damage/repair]. As it was constructed with small stone blocks shaped like bricks (塼形), imitating a brick pagoda (塼塔), it is clear that Silla's Buddhist art inherited the lineage of Koguryŏ and Paekche. It is unknown whether they chose Koguryŏ's brick-making techniques, which had developed since the Nangnang (Lelang) period, but it seems brick pagoda construction was not yet practiced in Koguryŏ and Paekche at that time. Since this was an era of frequent direct diplomatic exchanges with China, it is plausible to assume it received Chinese influence. Furthermore, eminent monks of the Silla Three Kingdoms period like Kaktŏk went to Liang, Chimyŏng and Wŏn'gwang to Chen, and Tamyuk to Sui, sought various construction methods, and returned, receiving the reverence of their countrymen. Thus, it seems appropriate to say they emulated continental temples and pagodas. However, fortunately, due to the presence of andesite nearby, they quarried and built with it. The overall form shows appropriate proportions between the pagoda body and the corbels (코-벨). The first story's body is slightly larger than the second and third, expressing the characteristic beauty of Three Kingdoms architecture—serene, stable, grand, and imposing—as seen in the Koguryŏ tomb Changgunch'ong (將軍塚) and the Paekche stone pagoda Mirŭk Pagoda. Entrances are made on all four sides of the first story, with images of Benevolent Kings (仁王) carved in relief (陽刻) to the left and right of each entrance. Stone lions are placed in round sculpture (圓彫) at the four corners of the pagoda base. A discussion of these sculptures will be included when specifically addressing sculpture.

Next, although today even the existence of its remaining foundation stones is doubtful, the Hwangnyongsa Pagoda was admired by all during the Silla period and was a wooden pagoda (木浮圖) rare in the world. Though the subject matter is scant, since we are exploring Silla architecture, it cannot be ignored, so we will briefly discuss it based on historical records.
Construction of Hwangnyong Temple (皇龍寺) began in the 14th year of King Chinhŭng and was completed in his 27th year, taking about 14 years. The Samguk Sagi, under King Chinhŭng's entry, states: <5>
Fourteenth year, Spring, second month, the king ordered the relevant office to build a new palace east of Wŏlsŏng. A yellow dragon appeared at the site. The king, finding this suspicious, changed it into a Buddhist temple and bestowed the name Hwangnyong ("Yellow Dragon").
Twenty-seventh year, Spring, second month (passage omitted), Hwangnyong Temple was completed.
However, the Hwangnyong Temple Pagoda was built 40 years after the temple's completion, in the 14th year of Queen Sŏndŏk. The Samguk Sagi, under Queen Sŏndŏk's entry, states:
Fourteenth year, third month, construction of the Hwangnyong Temple Pagoda began, following the request of Chajang.
According to this, it seems it was built at the request of Master Chajang (慈藏法師). Master Chajang entered Tang China in Queen Sŏndŏk's 5th year to seek the Dharma and returned in her 12th year. The Samguk Yusa records the origin legend (緣起) of this pagoda:
(Master Chajang) was traveling past the Taihe Pond (大和池邊) in China when suddenly a divine being emerged and asked, "Why have you come here?" Chajang replied, "To seek Bodhi (enlightenment)." The divine being bowed in respect and asked further, "What difficulties does your country face?" Chajang said, "Our country borders the Malgal (靺鞨) to the north and the Wa people (倭人, Japanese) to the south. The three kingdoms of Koryŏ [Koguryŏ] and Paekche repeatedly violate our borders. Neighboring bandits run rampant, causing distress to the people." The divine being said, "Your country now has a woman as ruler. She has virtue but lacks authority, hence the neighboring countries plot against her. You should return quickly to your homeland." Chajang asked, "Upon returning home, what should I do for benefit?" The god replied, "The Dharma-protecting dragon of Hwangnyong Temple is my eldest son. He received the command of King Brahma to come and protect this temple. When you return to your country, build a nine-story pagoda in the temple. Neighboring countries will submit, the Nine Han tribes (九韓) will come bringing tribute, and the royal fortunes will be secure. After building the pagoda, hold the P'algwanhoe (八關會, Eight Vows Assembly) and pardon criminals, then foreign enemies cannot cause harm. Furthermore, establish a meditation hall (精廬) for me in Namwŏn near the capital, and together we will pray for blessings. I too shall repay your virtue." Having spoken, he presented jade and suddenly vanished. While this too is hardly believable, there is no doubt that Master Chajang initiated this pagoda, partly to promote the flourishing of Buddhism and partly desiring the stability of the nation. Thus, the Paekche architect Abiji (阿非知) (refer to Paekche artists section, omitted) was invited, and construction proceeded with wood and stone. The Samguk Yusa states:
The record on the central pillar (刹柱記) says: Above the iron disk (鐵盤), the height is 42 ch'ŏk; below it, 183 ch'ŏk.
Here, "iron disk" (鐵盤) refers to the iron dew basin (露盤). "Above the iron disk" means the finial (相輪), and "the height above the iron disk is 42 ch'ŏk" means the length of the finial reached 42 ch'ŏk. Although it is regrettable that the transmission is incomplete, even from this, one marvels at its considerable scale. How much more so considering the praise:
Demons aiding, gods supporting, it pressed down on the imperial capital,
Its brilliant gold and jade stirred the flying eaves.
Climbing it, not only were the Nine Han subdued,
One first realized Heaven and Earth were exceptionally level. (Samguk Yusa)
That its praise was such allows us to imagine it achieved the utmost in magnificent beauty.
Among famous pagodas in the history of world Buddhist art, generally three are cited. What are they? Silla's Hwangnyong Temple Pagoda, Northern Wei's Yongning Temple Pagoda, and Gandhara's <6> Kanishka Stupa (雀離浮圖) are these. The Great Pagoda of Yongning Temple (永寧寺) in Northern Wei was also a large nine-story stupa (大浮圖), said to be visible from 100 li away from the capital and built with the utmost craftsmanship of the age, but it returned to nothingness less than ten-odd years after construction. Gandhara's Kanishka Stupa was a large 13-story stupa, its total height reaching over 600 ch'ŏk, counted as the foremost among the stupas of the Western Regions. As research progresses to this point, the eastward transmission of pagoda construction methods comes to mind. Perhaps Gandhara's Kanishka Stupa influenced the wooden pagodas of China and, further, those of Korea.

The people of Silla counted the newly built Hwangnyong Temple Pagoda as one of the Three Treasures. Gazing at the gleaming finial (相輪) in the bright morning sun, and listening to the sound of the treasure bells (寶鐸) chiming in harmony with the gentle breeze in the deepening twilight, they felt their nation growing stronger day by day. Eventually, they even attached the names of foreign enemies to each story. The Samguk Yusa quotes a passage from Tongdo Sŏngnipki (東都成立紀, Record of the Establishment of the Eastern Capital), selected by Monk Anhong (釋安弘):
(Passage omitted) If a nine-story pagoda is built, the calamities from neighboring countries can be suppressed. The first story represents Japan (日本), the second China (中華), the third Wu-Yue (吳越), the fourth T'aklla (托羅), the fifth Ungyu (鷹遊), the sixth Malgal (靺鞨), the seventh Tanguk (丹國, Khitan?), the eighth Yŏjŏk (女狄, Jurchen?), the ninth Yemaek (濊貊).
In ancient times, the people who conquered Egypt, as a symbol of victory, disregarding the difficulty of transport, brought back giant obelisks (오벨리스크). Here, however, without conquest or subsequent bringing back of spoils, they prevented invasion from others solely by the authority of a self-built pagoda. In the 8th year of the 48th king, Kyŏngmun Wang, the pagoda shook [in an earthquake], so orders were given for reconstruction in the 11th year, and it was completed in the ninth month of autumn in the 13th year. It had nine stories and its height was 22 chang (丈). During the Koryŏ period, it suffered repeated disasters and underwent repairs, but in the intercalary fourth month of summer in the 25th year of King Kojong [under Regent Ch'oe U, sometimes referred to as King Anhyo Wang posthumously, though this is very unusual - likely an error by the author or a specific interpretation, Kojong is standard], it was finally burned down by Mongol troops (蒙兵). Today, only the foundation stones (礎石) scattered in the ruins remain, cold and desolate.

Ch'ŏmsŏngdae (瞻星臺) was constructed during the reign of Queen Sŏndŏk and is the oldest extant observatory in East Asia. Its total height reaches over 30 ch'ŏk. It is built up in a cylindrical shape, slightly bulging outwards at the bottom, gradually narrowing towards the top. Then, above the central part where an entrance facing south is made, it curves outwards slightly before being topped by two layers of square frames (井桁). Surely, on its top, some kind of wondrous instrument for observing the heavens must have been installed. Thus, its overall shape resembles that seen in Koryŏ celadon wine bottles, expressing the beauty of graceful curves (婉麗한). Its grand structure allows it to contain a profound strength within its elegant interior. If we possessed a keen artistic appreciation, merely observing this single structure would allow us to understand the characteristics of Silla architecture repeatedly discussed above, and thereby perceive the artistic psychology of its people. <7>

**Summary**

This article by Pak Chonghong discusses the art of Old Silla (pre-unification), emphasizing its unique origins rooted in "divine virtue" rather than conquest, unlike other states. It highlights Silla's early cultural development in music and its adoption of Buddhism, starting with Mukhcha and solidifying after Ich'adon's martyrdom, leading to major temple constructions like Hŭngnyunsa, Hwangnyongsa, and Punhwangsa under royal patronage. The author stresses the role of abundant natural resources (gold, iron, granite) in facilitating artistic production, including grand tombs and Buddhist sculptures. Key architectural examples like the early Kŭmsŏng/Wŏlsŏng palaces, the comparatively simple tomb structures (despite rich grave goods), the extant Punhwangsa Pagoda (noting its brick-imitation style and later modifications), the legendary nine-story Hwangnyongsa Pagoda (comparing it to famous pagodas in China and Gandhara), and the unique Ch'ŏmsŏngdae observatory are described. The author posits that despite Silla's later cultural development compared to Koguryŏ and Paekche due to geography, its inherent artistic talent led to rapid progress and eventual superiority even before unification. From a colonial history perspective, the article is interesting for its focus on establishing a distinct and highly developed ancient Korean artistic tradition (specifically Silla's) separate from, and in some respects superior to, neighboring cultures, even while acknowledging continental influences like Buddhism and architectural styles. The emphasis on Silla's unique "divine virtue," innate talent, and eventual pre-eminence could be seen as reflecting a desire to assert Korean cultural identity and historical achievement during a period of Japanese rule.

古新羅時代의 美術,
						朴鍾鴻
玆에 신라라 함은 삼국시대의 신라 즉 古新羅를 지칭하는 者요. 인하야 唐文化의 영향을 蒙한 통일 이후의 신라와는 미술사상 일대구획을 有하는 者-라.
太白山系의 主脈이 장차 東南에 盡하려 하는 處에 迎日灣으로 주입하는 兄江이 有하니 그 상류 諸川의 湊合하는 평야에는 일즉 六村의 民人이 神人을 추대하야 건국의 鴻業을 圖할 새 他의 戰功이나 약탈로써 군주의 位를 貪하며 立國의 勢를 矜함과는 自然 其軌가 상이하얏도다. 他는 威로서 國을 統하얏스나 신라는 그 神德에 民人이 歸服하얏나니 隣邦人의 來化하는 者- 또한 不少하얏슴이라. 왕이 비로 더부러 六部를 巡撫하야 其業울 勸督하얏고 馬韓이 국왕의 상을 당하매 혹이 前日의 非禮하얏슴을 責하야 征코져 하얏스나 不從하고 오히려 使를 遣하야 吊慰하얏스며 老嫗의 饑寒함을 見하고 그 衣를 解하야써 覆하엿다 전하니 隣寇의 來侵을 자신의 不德의 所致라 하며 民情에 通치 못함을 上에 居하야 察치 못하는 죄라 嘆하얏도다. 此는 비록 中古의 관습으로 일반 행사에 계급의 別이 不無하엿섯슬지나 其政治가 三姓이 前後하아 立하는 一種異樣의 政軆이엇스며 隨하야 상하의 조화를 得하얏섯슴이로다. 이에 國邊을 침범하얏던 近邦人도 그 有道의 國임에는 自愧하야 還歸하얏스며 卞韓이 來降하얏고 東沃沮가 良馬를 獻하얏도다. 鳴呼 不義의 干戈가 향하는 處에는 반항의 矢石이 睨하며 자애의 仁德이 發하는 處에는 來化의 同樂이 待함인가. 국왕의 死靈에 대하야서도 崇敬의 意를 표하야 거대한 능묘를 築하얏고 제2대 南解王 3년 春正月에는 시조의 廟를 立하니 역대의 제왕이 此에 親祀하얏섯도다. 如斯히 하야 辰韓 이후로 그 無邪하고 순박한 民의 생활은 그 심미적 정서로 하야곰 각 방면으로 표현케 하얏나니 爲先 음악으로 허다한 천재를 出하얏도다. 玄琴과 가야금이 비롯오 新曲에 律調를 합하게 되얏고  비파와 三竹 등의 악기가 旣行하니 전설적 신라의 玉笛은 금일에까지 重寶로 愛賞하는＜1＞ 바-로다. 국가보호의 澤을 被함이 不少하얏거니와 80船艘에 수다한 樂人과 각종의 악기를 送하야 扶桑允恭帝의 喪을 吊하얏스며 그 후에도 諸樂의 踵出하얏슴으로부터 察之컨대 寂窈한 月夜에 신라 王都의 공기를 嫋嫋하게 波動하던 그 운율은 과연 天生의 충동이 塵界蟬脫의 환희를 讚함이엇슬 것이요. 鮮麗한 예술적 嫩芽가 실로 此에 심오한 盤根을 下하얏섯다 할지로다.
불교와의 관계는 月氏의 金像이 鐵鍾을 乘來하야 金剛山 楡岾寺에 안치되얏다 하며 가라국 金首露王의 后, 許黃玉이가 서역으로부터 석탑을 載到하얏다 전하나 可惜하게도 楡岾寺 能仁殿의 諸銅造小佛像이 羅代의 遺物이며 伽羅의 국호가 인도의 방언과 似하다 함 등 뿐으로는 此를 信키 陀£한 者인즉 확실한 고증의 사료를 발견하기 기대하는 바-요. 假使 그의 전설이 사실이라 할지라도 영향이 일부 산간에 보급하얏슬 뿐이엿고 또한 中巀´에 廢絶되얏섯슬 者인즉 吾人은 史記에 據하야 訥袛王時에 沙門 墨胡子가 고구려로부터 來傳한 者로써 불교미술의 源頭를 作한 바- 신라불교의 始라 하노라. 그후 불법이 漸行하야 조정의 衆議가 決치 못하얏다가 異次頓의 기적을 怪想하야 감히 佛事를 毁치 못하얏나니 三國史記에 云
(云云前略) 僉曰, 今見僧徒, 童頭異服, 議論奇詭, 而非常道, 今若縱之, 恐有後悔, 臣等雖卽重罪, 不敢奉詔, 異次頓獨曰, 今群臣之言非也, 夫有非常之人然後, 有非常之事, 今聞佛敎淵奧, 恐不可不信. 王曰, 衆人之言, 牢不可破, 汝獨異言, 不能兩從. 遂下吏將誅, 異次頓臨死曰, 我爲法就刑, 佛若有神, 吾死必有異事, 及斬之, 血從斷處湧, 色白如乳云云
翌年에 令을 下하야 살생을 금하얏고 상하가 擧하야 불법에 귀의하니 旭日의 昇함 갓치 渤興할 세 釋 法空이 곳 法興王이요 釋法雲이 곳 眞興王이라. 이에 雄麗한 사찰을 建하며 靈異한 불상을 鑄하니 신라의 찬연한 불교미술을 형성한 자-로다.
더욱 그 풍부한 天産은 가히 재료를 공급함에 裕足하야 미술발달의 一助를 作하얏나니 동양의 黃金國으로 土味가 비옥하며 황금의 多産이 泥와 如하야 西人의 商賈가 귀환함을 망각한다고 일즉 전할 새 그 등으로 하야곰 遠游의 志를 懷케 한 것이 신라임은 물론이어니와 眼眩의 금은채색이 多在한 寶國이라 하야 扶桑의 島民으로 하야곰 선망의 意를＜2＞ 금치 못하게 하얏고 인하야 海寇의 不息하얏슴을 思하면 金貨를 旣用한 신라의 문물을 可測이로다. 辰韓時부터 유명한 鐵, 도처에 産하는 화강석의 良材, 金鰲山의 수정 등은 써 금일도 京城博物館에 拜하는 大鐵像을 주조케 하얏고 壯麗한 석벽과 塔婆를 축성케 하얏스며 대규모의 왕릉을 휘황케 한 부장품을 琢磨케 하얏도다.
이상과 如하야 그 자연의 환경과 국가의 安穩으로부터 그 순결한 禀傳의 정서는 일층 예민한 예술적 충동을 作하얏고 위대한 불법의 전래는써 그 미술품으로 하야곰 다방면의 형식을 具하야 표현되는 一動機를 持케 하얏나니 특히 그 양호한 재료의 求得이 용이함을 인하야 古來로 오직 海東의 君子國이라 칭할 뿐이오, 문물로는 穉微함과 似하든 此邦에 장차 미술국의 신라를 건설케 된지라. 그 위치가 반도 동남에 在하야 대륙과의 교통이 三國 중 他의 二國보다 자못 편리치 못함으로 문화의 발흥도 또한 稍後함을 면치 못하얏슬지나 그 殊勝한 소질은 장족의 진보를 促하야 통일시대 이전에 이미 他보다 우월한 점이 不無함에 至하얏섯도다.

第一. 建築
慶州는 신라 千歲의 왕도라. 南山麓下에 성을 築하고 宮을 建한 후 此를 離함이 殆無하얏나니 此는 그 국세가 강하야 外人의 침범을 不能케 한 故라 할지나 또한 四園가 天險과 지리의 妙를 得한 바- 그 지세에 의함이 多大하얏섯다할지요 고구려나 백제가 舊都의 위치조차 금일에 至하야 일일히 확연한 단정을 下치 못하게 遷移함과는 그 類가 不同하얏도다. 이에 유적이 경주를 중심하야 遠方에까지 散及함이 희소함으로 연구의 대상을 탐구함에는 他例에서 當함보다는 그 難함이 稍滅한다 할지로다. 초기의 건축으로는 三國史記에 曰,
(始祖)二十一年, 築京城, 號曰金城.
二十六年 春正月, 營宮室於金城.
세대가 浸遠하야 그 유적이 湮滅에 歸하얏슴으로 금일에 想得키 難한 者ㅡ라. 오직 三國史記 脫解王條下에 九年春三月, 王夜聞金城西鷄林樹間, 有雞鳴聲云云 이라 記하얏슨즉 始林東側 近傍에 在하얏섯슴을 가히 짐작할지요. 東國輿地勝覽에는 金城을 在府東四里, 始祖赫居世所築, 土城周一千四百七尺 이라 하얏고 후대에＜3＞ 築한 바- 月城을 在府東南五里, 娑婆王二十二年築之, 形如半月故名, 土築周三千二十三尺 이라 하얏슨즉 金城이 月城의 서북 약 1리(朝鮮舊里程) 許에 在하얏슴을 可知할지로다. 이에 月城과 月城 北面에 在하얏던 滿月城과 此의 金城이 鼎在하얏섯슴을 聯測할지니 더욱 그 궁궐의 雄麗한 대건축이 상응하야 조성되얏섯슴에 想至할지로다. 月城은 遺址가 尙存할 서 蚊川을 南面에 帶하야 半月의 形을 作하니 稍高한 구릉을 평탄히 하야 成한 者-라.
三國史記 地理志에 云,
始祖以來, 處金城, 至後世, 多處兩月城.
然而此에 주의할 者-는 山城이니 그 中 明活山城은 慈悲王時에 일시 此를 葺하고 移居함이 有하얏섯도다.
고분은 동서의 山麓에 무수 산재하야 유물 중 最多하며 중요한 者-니 邑南에 在한 鳳凰臺와 갓치 其高가 근 七丈許에 至한 거대한 자가 多存하나 금일까지에 발굴된 자는 비교적 규모가 小한 자임으로 尙且 철저한 考究는 후일을 기함이 多하려니와 세상에 발표된 바-그 건축의 형식을 개괄할진대 木棺을 葬함에 槨이 無하고 오직 磧礫으로써 此를 埋하며 更히 그 상부를 점토류로써 覆하야 頹崩을 방어함에 불과하든 자로부터 점차 변천하야 자연의 野石으로써 槨을 築하고 淺狹한 입구를 作함에 至함인 듯 하나 순금제의 寶冠과 우수한 馬具類를 위시하야 도기, 옥류, 琉璃器 등 가히 數十箱에 充할 부장품이 出한 鳳凰臺 越便의 불교미술이 영향이 及한 고분이고서 磧礫으로 축성된 자임을 想하면 水磨한 화강석의 巨材로써 意匠을 盡하야 營造한 고구려나 백제의 고분에 비하야 자못 유치한 者-라 할지로다.
불교적 건축으로는 梁來의 佛舍利를 迎한 興輪寺를 위시하야 眞興五妃로서 尼가 되야 住한 永興寺, 慈藏 법사가 菩薩戒本을 講하던 皇龍寺, 元曉 대사가 華嚴疏를 纂하던 芬皇寺 등이 삼국시대에 旣有하얏섯스나 현존한 자로는 芬皇寺塔의 3층과 幢竿支柱 뿐이라.(總論에 신라 三寶 중 芬皇寺塔이라 하얏슴은 皇龍寺塔의 誤이기 玆에 正함) 三國史記 善德王條下에 曰
三年春正月, 改元仁平芬皇寺成.
此의 탑도 당시에 造築된 자-라 추정되는 바-요. 善德王 3년은 백제 武王 35년이라. 인하야 백제 武王 時에 建한 바- 益山 彌勒塔과 동시에 조성된 자-니 幷하야 현존한 조선 最古의 탑파가 되도다. 전설에 의하건대 총 9층이엇든 것이 壬辰亂時에 日兵이 3층을 파괴하고 그후 寺僧의 未練한 修築은 更히 3층을 尤破하야 지금에 遺存한＜4＞ 3층을 留함이라 하도다. 然而 年前에 당국이 此를 改築할 時에 탑내로부터 1개의 石函을 발견하니 石函 내에 허다한 보물을 藏하얏섯고 더욱 고려 鑄의 金貨를 出한지라 이에 고려시대에 또한 개축되얏섯슴을 可知할지로다. 고로 吾人이 금일에 見하는 바- 芬皇寺塔은 신라인의 築한 者가 아니요 원형에 의하야 수차의 改築을 經하 者-라. 과연 그 무리한 금번의 改築은 오직 一基 뿐인 此 석탑의 감상이나마 불가능케 하얏나니 何某가 3층 상부의 禿頭를 望하고야 昔日의 天을 摩하려 하든 9층의 탑을 상기할 者-며 石灰의 醜粉으로 裝한 塔身을 見하고야 幽玄한 安山巖의 色美를 感할 者-리오. 此가 실로 제3회의 餘殘한 3층까지 미술상 가치로 觀하야 파괴되얏슴이 안인가 疑하는 바-로다. 塼形의 小石材로 축조하야 塼塔을 倣한 者일새 신라의 불교미술이 고구려와 백제의 계통을 承한 자임은 물론이라. 낙랑시대로부터 발달한 고구려의 塼에 工範을 擇한 자인지도 不可知也어니와 고구려와 백제에서는 당시에 尙次塼塔의 건립이 未行한 듯 하니 중국과 國使의 교통이 직접으로 빈번한 시대이엇든 이상 그의 영향을 蒙하얏든 것이라 하야도 무방할지요. 더욱 신라삼국시대의 고승 覺德은 梁으로, 智明과 圓光은 陳으로, 曇育은 隋로 入하야 ꊰ�각 工法을 구하고 還하매 國人의 尊崇을 受하얏슨즉 대륙의 寺塔을 擬하얏다 함이 타당할 듯 하도다. 然而 僥倖 近傍에 安山巖이 有하얏슴으로 此를 切理하야 築한 자-라 하노라. 全形은 塔身과 「코-벨」의 비례가 適宜하며 初層의 塔身이 2, 3층에 비하야 稍大함으로 고구려의 고분 將軍塚에서와 백제의 석탑 彌勒塔에서 見하는 즉 삼국시대 건축의 특색인 沈着, 安固하며 雄大, 기발한 壯美를 표현하도다. 初層에는 四面에 입구를 作하고 입구 좌우에는 仁王의 像을 陽刻으로 彫出하얏스며 塔基의 四隅에는 石獅를 圓彫하야 置하니 此等의 조각물에 대한 考究는 특히 조각을 논할 時에 並述코져 하노라.
次에 금일은 僅遺한 礎石의 존재까지도 의심케 되얏스나 신라시대에는 만인의 仰慕하든 塔婆이엇고 세계에 稀類한 木浮圖이엇든 皇龍四塔을 비록 대상으로는 빈약하나마 신라의 건축을 탐구하는 바에 가히 不顧치 못할 者이기에 史乘에 의하야 暫論코져 하노라.
皇龍寺는 眞興王 14년에 功을 起하야 同 27년에 畢하니 약 14년간을 要하얏도다. 三國史記 眞興王條下에 曰＜5＞
十四年 春二月, 王命所司, 築新宮於月城東, 黃龍見其地, 王疑之, 改爲佛寺, 賜號曰, 皇龍.
二十七年 春二月(云云中略) 皇龍寺畢功.
然而 皇龍寺塔은 寺成 후 更히 40년을 閱하야 善德王 14년에 축조하니 三國史記 善德王條下에 曰
十四年 三月, 創造皇龍寺塔, 從慈藏之請也.
此에 의하건대 慈藏 법사의 請을 副함인 듯 하니 慈藏 법사는 善德王 5년에 入唐하야 法을 구하고 同 12년에 還한 者-라. 三國遺事에 此塔의 緣起를 記하되,
(慈藏法師) 經由中國大和池邊, 忽有神人出, 問胡爲至此. 藏答曰, 求菩提故. 神人禮拜, 又問汝國有何留難, 藏曰, 我國北連靺鞨, 南接倭人, 麗濟三國, 迭犯封陲, 隣寇縱橫, 是爲民梗. 神人云, 今汝國, 以女爲王, 有德而無威, 故隣國謀之, 宜速歸本國. 藏問歸鄕, 將何爲利益乎. 神曰, 王龍寺護法龍, 是吾長子, 受梵王之命, 來護是寺, 汝歸本國, 成九層塔於寺中, 隣國降伏, 九韓來貢, 王祚安矣, 建塔之後, 設八關會, 赦罪人則外賊不能爲害, 更爲我, 於京畿南原, 置一精廬, 共資矛福, 矛亦報之德矣. 言己, 遂奉玉而獻之, 忽不現. 此亦 가히 信치 못할 者-나 하여컨 慈藏法師가 一은 불법의 隆興을 圖하고 一은 국가의 安穩을 원하야 此塔을 起하얏슴은 無疑하도다. 이에 백제의 건축사 阿非知(백제의 미술가 參考云云前略)를 請來하야 木石으로 경영할새 三國遺事에 云
刹柱記云, 鐵盤己上, 高四十二尺, 己下一百八十三尺.
玆에 鐵盤이라 함은 鐵製의 露盤을 指稱함이니 鐵盤 己上이라 함은 相輪을 云함이요, 鐵盤己上의 高가 42척이라 함은 즉 相輪의 長이 42척에 至한다 함이라. 傳함이 불완전함을 可惜히 想하는 바-어니와 此로 推하야도 그 구조가 자못 宏大하얏슴에 경탄할 者-어든 又況
鬼拱神扶壓帝京 輝煌金碧動飛甍 登臨何啻九韓伏, 始覺乾坤特地平. (三國遺事)
그 讚이 如斯하엿슴에리오. 그 雄麗의 美를 極한 者이엇슴을 可想할지로다.
세계불교미술사상 저명한 탑파로 대개 三者를 擧할지니 何오. 신라의 皇龍寺塔, 북위의 永寧寺塔, 「간다라」의＜6＞ 雀離浮圖가 是也라. 북위의 永寧寺 大塔도 또한 9층의 大浮圖로 京을 離하기 百里에 오히려 此를 遙望하얏다 하며 世工을 盡하야 造營한 자이엇다고 전하나 건축 후 근근 10여 년을 經치 못하야 烏有에 歸하얏고 「간다라」의 雀離浮圖는 13층의 大浮圖로 其高가 또한 합하야 600여 척에 달하매 서역의 浮圖 중 第一에 數하는 자이엇도다. 考究의 步가 此에 至하매 建塔法의 東傳이 연상되나니 대개 『간다라』의 雀離浮圖가 중국과 進하야는 조선의 목조탑파에까지 영향을 及함인가 하노라.
신라의 民人은 신축한 皇龍寺塔을 三寶의 一로 數하야 선명한 旭日에 晃朗한 相輪을 望하며 漸發하는 暮夕이 微風에 和鳴하는 寶鐸의 聲響을 聞하고는 日로 자국의 강성하야 감을 感하얏나니 드듸어 각층에 外寇의 名까지 附함에 至하얏도다. 三國遺事에 釋安弘의 選한 바- 東都成立紀의 文을 引載하야 曰
(云云前略) 建九層塔, 則隣國之災可鎭, 第一層日本, 第二層中華, 第三層吳越, 第四層托羅, 第五層鷹遊, 第六層靺鞨, 第七層丹國, 第八層女狄, 第九層濊貊.
古昔에 埃及을 정복한 국민은 戰勝의 表章이라 하야 그 운반상의 곤란도 不關하고 거대한 「오벨리스크,를 携歸하얏섯다 하거니와 此에는 征함도 無하고 隨하야 持來함도 업시 自築한 탑의 威로서 오직 他의 侵來를 防하얏도다. 제48대 景文王 8년에 至하야 탑이 震하얏스매 同 11년에 개조를 명하야 13년 秋九月에 成하니 9층이요. 其高가 22丈이라. 고려시대에 至하야 누차의 災를 당하고 修築을 가하엿스나 高宗
安孝王 25년 夏閏四月에 드듸어 蒙兵의 燒燬하는 바-되니 금일에 至하야는 오직 遺墟에 轉列한 초석이 冷寒할 뿐이로다.
瞻星臺는 善德王時代에 축조된 者-요 현존한 동양 最古의 천문대라. 全高가 30여 척에 달하니 원통의 형으로 築上하되 下方이 稍히 膨出하고 上함을 隨하야 점차로 협소하야 지다가 更히 南面에 출입구를 作한 중앙부의 上邊에 至하야 미약한 度로 외부를 향하야 圓을 劃하며 2종의 井桁을 戴한지라. 아니 그 상부에는 천문을 관측하는 불가사의한 기계를 설치하얏섯슬 것이라. 이에 그 全形이 고려청자의 酒甁에서 見하는 바와도 似하야 婉麗한 곡선의 美를 표현하얏스며 그 웅대한 구조는 此로 하야곰 그 優美한 內裡에 沈重한 力美를 먹음게 하얏도다. 吾人이 만약 예민한 예술적 鑑賞眼을 具한 者이엇드면 오직 此 一基의 유물을 觀함으로부터 이상에 屢說하야오는 신라건축의 특색을 이해할 것이오. 由하야 그 인민의 예술적 심리를 窺得하얏슬 것이라 하노라.＜7＞
