-Legend of Lady Nokchok (鹿足夫人傳說)-
About fifty *ri* west of the old Sukch'ŏn-ŭp in P'yŏngwŏn County, along the coast of the Yellow Sea, there is a large field (野) called Sibisamsamch'ŏn (十二三千). Regarding the origin of the name Sibisamsamch'ŏn for this field, there is a very interesting and mysterious legend. That is, long, long ago, during the Koguryŏ era, there was a certain queen consort whose body (形軆) was peculiar: she had twelve breasts and her feet were like those of a deer, so her alias (別名) was Lady Nokchok (鹿足夫人). One day she gave birth (生産) to twelve brothers, which the King considered an inauspicious sign (不祥之兆). He had the children put into a wooden box (木凾) and set adrift in the West Sea (西海). The box floated until it reached a certain place in China's Shandong Province (中國山東省). At that time, a certain Chinese person observed the atmospheric signs (望氣), retrieved the wooden box, and adopted (收養) the twelve children. As the children grew up (生長), their physical strength (膂力) was immense and they possessed much wisdom and strategy (智畧), becoming great generals of the Tang state (唐國). At one time, these twelve great generals, each leading three thousand great troops, invaded (侵犯) Koguryŏ, first occupying (占領) Sinmido island in Sŏnch'ŏn and advancing as far as the Sukch'ŏn region. At that time, the Koguryŏ King heard this urgent report (急報) and was greatly startled. He urgently gathered his vassals (群臣) to discuss (議論) a plan (策) for defense (防禦). Just then, Lady Nokchok attended (叅席) the meeting. Hearing that the enemy generals (敵將) were twelve brothers and that their feet were like deer feet (鹿足), she thought to herself (心中自思), suspecting (疑心) they might be the sons she had given birth to and abandoned previously. She immediately requested (請) of the King that she would try (試驗的) to appease (懷柔) the twelve great generals, and the King, greatly pleased (깁버하야), gladly consented (快諾). Thereupon, Lady Nokchok went out to the field, set up (設) a watchtower (櫓樓), sat on the platform (臺上), called the twelve great generals, had them stand below the platform (臺下), and said, "Long ago, I bore twelve children in one birth and abandoned them in the sea. Not knowing if they lived or died, I have always grieved (悲哀) in my heart (心中). Now I hear that the generals are twelve brothers and also that their feet are like deer feet, so it is clear they are my sons. If you do not believe (信聽) my words, I shall now test it." Immediately, she squeezed (니) her breasts with her hands, and milk (젓) spurted from the twelve openings (穴) simultaneously into the mouths of the twelve generals. Also, she gave them twelve pairs of socks (버선(襪)) she had prepared in advance (預備), and they fit ( 만는지라) their feet exactly. The twelve great generals were greatly surprised, bowed simultaneously to Lady Nokchok, prostrated (업듸여서) themselves on the ground, and said, "We humble sons (小子 等) drifted (漂流) in the ocean and did not know the whereabouts (所在) of our parents. Now, hearing the Lady's words, and also ＜76＞ drinking the milk and trying on the socks, there is not the slightest error (差錯). The Lady is truly (眞實) our mother (母親)." And then they shed tears. The lady also shed tears, held their hands, patted their backs (등을 어르만지면서), and said, "Heaven bore you, Heaven abandoned you, and Heaven allowed us to meet." The twelve generals, in unison (異口同聲), all said again, "She who bore us is Mother, she who abandoned us is Mother, she who gave us milk is Mother, and she who gave us socks is Mother. How could we dare (敢) disobey (拒逆) Mother's command? How could we dare invade (侵犯) Mother's country?" They immediately withdrew (罷) their troops and submitted (歸化). Therefore, that field was named Sibisamsamch'ŏn (十二三千), and there is also an old marching fortress (古行城) where the twelve generals fought (싸흔) at that time (the fortress is also on the coast, and its foundation site (基址) remains intact (完然) to this day, its length (長) being 18,817 *ch'ŏk*). That place name is Kosŏng-ri (古城里), and the village (村) where the mother and sons lived together (相居) is said to have been called Yŏlgwi-ri (悅歸里).
This legend is briefly recorded (略記錄) in the Sukch'ŏn Ŭpchi (肅川邑誌) and the Anju Ŭpchi (安州邑誌). Also, the P'yŏngyangji (平壤誌) states that in ancient times, there was a Lady Nokchok at Taesŏngsan mountain who gave birth to nine sons at once (the rest is similar (相似) to the Sukch'ŏn Ŭpchi, therefore (故) omitted (略)). After withdrawing the troops, they abandoned (棄) their armor (甲冑), returned (還) to Taesŏngsan, seized (奪取) Yongam hermitage, and resided (居住) there. Today's Noksuam (鹿水菴) and Tudasa (頭陀寺) are said to be (云) her final resting place (所終地).

◇Kye Wŏrhyang and Okke (桂月香과 玉介)
During the Imjin War (壬辰亂), there were many people, regardless of gender, who established fidelity and died for righteousness (立節死義). However, among those of lowly status (賤役) who were able capably (能히) to establish fidelity and die for righteousness were the Poju *kisaeng* Non'gae (普州妓 論介) and the P'yŏngyang *kisaeng* Kye Wŏrhyang (平壤妓 桂月香). No, these two people not only passively (消極的) offered their own bodies as sacrifices (犧牲) to establish their fidelity (節義), but also actively (積極的) used wonderfully strange and exquisitely clever plans (奇絶妙絶한 計), inscrutable to gods and ghosts (神鬼莫測), to behead (斬) enemy generals, each a match for ten thousand men (萬夫不當), with the so-called 'sword at their waist' (腰下一劍), thereby relieving (解) the national crisis (國難). However, the facts about Non'gae were briefly recorded (畧錄) in last year's (昨年) Kyŏngnam issue (慶南號) of this magazine (本誌), so readers may still (尙히) remember (記憶). Therefore, here I will merely (但히) briefly note (畧記) the historical facts (史實) of Kye Wŏrhyang's establishment of fidelity to provide (供) reference (參考) for general readers (一般讀者). Now (却說), Kye Wŏrhyang was a P'yŏngyang government *kisaeng* (平壤府妓) during the reign of King Sŏnjo. Her other name (一名) was Wŏlsŏn (月仙). From childhood (自少), her talent and beauty (才華) were exceptional (絶特), and her physical beauty (姿色) was extremely fine (甚佳), so her good reputation (芳名) was widespread (藉藉) as the number one person (第一人) among the various *kisaeng* of the Kwansŏ region (關西諸妓) at that time (當時). Encountering (當하야) the Imjin War, P'yŏngyang Castle unfortunately (不幸) fell (陷落), and while numerous people became enemy prisoners (俘虜), she also became a captive (捕虜) of Konishi Hi (小西飛), the vice-general (副將) of Konishi Yukinaga (行長). Not being a kite (鳶) nor a fish (魚), how could the body of a weak (軟弱) woman escape (脫出) the enemy camp, like an iron jar fortress (鐵瓮城)? If she thought only of momentary (暫時) righteousness and loyalty (義理) and fidelity (節操), she could have immediately embraced the sorrow (恨) of 'flowers scattering and jade shattering' (花飛玉碎) on the spot (現場) and returned to the eternal (永遠) Heaven (天國). However, possessing much wisdom and strategy (智謀兼多), she thought that rather than simply (單純) dying for fidelity's sake (節義만 爲하야 즉는이보다는), it was better to endure humiliation (屈辱) for a time and seize (타서) an opportunity (機會) to plot against (圖함) the enemy. In every way (百方), she bought (買) the enemy's favor (歡心) and dispelled (解) his suspicion (其疑). One day (一日), knowing that Yangŭigong Kim Kyŏngsŏ (良毅公 金景瑞) (also named Kim Ungsŏ (金應瑞)) was practicing horsemanship (習馬) outside the castle walls (城外) <77> (at that time, Kim Kyŏngsŏ was a P'yŏngyang Sunbyŏlch'ogwan (平壤巡別哨官) and usually (平素) had a close relationship (親分) with Wŏrhyang), she earnestly requested (懇請) the enemy general that she wanted to do some kite flying (紙鳶戲) near Ŭlmiltae Pavilion (乙密臺附近). The enemy general, not suspecting (疑치 안이하고) even a little bit (小毫), gladly consented (快諾). Wŏrhyang rejoiced inwardly (萬萬暗喜), went near Ŭlmiltae, flew (날녀) a kite (紙鳶) into Kim Kyŏngsŏ's camp (陣中), and wrote on the kite to do thus and thus (如此如此). Kim Kyŏngsŏ also caught the kite and knew (알엇다) Wŏrhyang's clever plan (妙計). The next day (翌日), when Kyŏngsŏ was again practicing horsemanship outside the walls, Wŏrhyang, who was inside the castle (城中) with the enemy general observing (觀望) the outside, tearfully requested (泣請) the enemy, saying, "My older brother (男兄) is practicing horsemanship in that place (彼處). If you permit (許) me to meet him once (一次面會), I could die without any remaining regret (死無餘恨)." The enemy general again consented (承諾) and called him into the castle (불녀드렷다). The enemy general, in order to gain (得키 爲하야) Wŏrhyang's favor, gave him special favorable treatment (特別優待) and also permitted (許) him to come and go freely (無常出入) usually. Wŏrhyang rejoiced inwardly (心中暗喜) that the enemy general had fallen into (陷) her clever plan. One day, the enemy general held a banquet (宴會) (at that time, the enemy general resided (居) at Taedonggwan Hall (大同舘)). Wŏrhyang strongly urged (强勸) him to drink alcohol (酒) until he fell down drunk (醉倒). Taking advantage (乘) of the enemy general's deep sleep (宿睡), she blocked (塞) the curtain bells (帳鈴) with cotton padding (綿絮) (originally (元來), the enemy general was very suspicious (多疑) and hung (懸) bells on his curtain (帳) to check (驗) comings and goings (去來)). She went outside (出外) and called loudly (大聲) for Kim Kyŏngsŏ. Kyŏngsŏ, wearing (佩) his long sword (長劍), crossed over and entered (越入) the castle and entered the tent (帳中) with Wŏrhyang. At that time, the enemy general was leaning on (據) a chair (椅子), just sleeping (方睡), but both eyes (兩目) were still open (尙張), his face was flushed red (紅色滿面), and he held (持) a pair of swords (雙劍) in his hand as if intending to strike (斫) someone. Kyŏngsŏ rushed in fiercely (猛然) and beheaded (斬) the enemy general with his long sword (長釰). Although his head (其頭) had already (임이) fallen (落) to the ground, he was still able (能히) to strike (斫) with the swords (釰), one hitting (着) the wall (壁) and the other hitting (着) Kye [Wŏrhyang? Likely a typo, maybe pillar? "桂" (Kye) is part of her name, but context suggests an object like "柱" (pillar)]. (It is said (云) sword marks (釰痕) still exist (尙有) on the pillars (柱) of Taedonggwan Hall). Kyŏngsŏ took the head, carried (負) Wŏrhyang on his back, and was escaping outside the castle when he knew (知) they could not both survive (兩全치 못할줄). He said to Wŏrhyang, "Rather than both dying (兩人皆死), it is right (올타) that only one dies," and asked who should die and who should live (孰死孰生함이 可한 것). Wŏrhyang readily (快然) consented (承諾) to die herself. Alas (嗚呼)! Kye Wŏrhyang, righteous and ardent (義烈) for all ages (萬古), finally (遂히) became a pitiful (可憐) soul (魂) under Kyŏngsŏ's sword (刀下). (The enemy camp only came to know (始知) this the next day (其翌日)). Afterwards (其後), a certain provincial governor (某監司), thinking highly (壯히 思) of her righteousness (義), established (立) a portrait shrine (影堂) for her inside Changgyŏngmun Gate (長慶門內). Then, in the year Ŭlmi (乙未) of King Hŏnjong (憲宗) [1835], Governor Chŏng Wŏnyong (鄭元容) newly built (刱建) the Ŭiryŏlsa Shrine (義烈祠) in Kwanp'ungdong (觀風洞), installed (設) her portrait (像), and erected (立) the Ŭiryŏlpi Stele (義烈碑). During the time of Governor Min Yŏnghwi (閔泳徽), this was also rebuilt (重建). Later, the government *kisaeng* Kim Ch'aeran (金彩鸞) also installed (設) a portrait (影幀). In that portrait shrine (影堂), she is enshrined together (配) with Okke (玉介). Okke was also (亦是) a P'yŏngyang *kisaeng* who, during the Imjin War (壬亂), refused to be disgraced and submit (辱屈치 안이하고) and threw herself from the castle wall and hanged herself (墮城自經) (Min Yŏnghwi also erected a stele (亦立碑) for her). Ch'aeran was originally (元) a *kisaeng* from Yangdŏk (陽德妓生) who became the concubine (妾) of Ch'ungjanggong Ŏ Chaeyŏn (忠壯公魚在淵). During the Pyŏng'in Yangyo (丙寅洋擾) [1866] at Kanghwa (江華), when he died maintaining his fidelity (節死), Kim dressed in men's clothing (男服), entered (入) amidst the arrows and stones (矢石中), carried (負) the bodies (尸) of Ŏ Chaeyŏn and his brother, came (來) back, and returned them for burial (歸葬). Therefore (故), the government at that time (當時政府), considering (思) her righteousness (其義), bestowed the title (封) of Sukpuin (淑夫人). (Later people (後人) also installed Ch'aeran's portrait (影幀) in that shrine, and even now (至今), the portraits (影幀) of the three women are still (依然) there (有)). (Recorded by Ch'ŏng'o (靑吾記)) ＜78＞

**Summary**

This article recounts two stories of notable Korean women. The first is the legend of Lady Nokchok, a Koguryŏ queen with deer feet and twelve breasts, who bore twelve sons abandoned at sea. They later became Tang generals and invaded Koguryŏ but were recognized and appeased by their mother, leading to peace and the naming of the Sibisamsamch'ŏn field. The second part details the historical account of Kye Wŏrhyang, a P'yŏngyang kisaeng during the Imjin War, who cleverly aided the Korean general Kim Kyŏngsŏ in assassinating a Japanese commander and then sacrificed her own life to ensure the general's escape. It also briefly mentions Okke, another P'yŏngyang kisaeng who committed suicide rather than submit during the Imjin War, and Kim Ch'aeran, who bravely retrieved her master Ŏ Chaeyŏn's body during the 1866 French campaign. From the perspective of Korean colonial history (published 1924), this article is interesting for its emphasis on national legends and historical heroines, particularly women embodying resistance, intelligence, and self-sacrifice against foreign invaders (Chinese, Japanese, French). It served to bolster national pride and preserve cultural narratives of Korean resilience and virtue during Japanese occupation, highlighting figures who prioritized national well-being and righteousness over personal safety, providing models of patriotic conduct.

鹿足夫人·桂月香·玉介/-鹿足夫人傳說-
平原郡舊肅川邑에서 西方으로 約五十里를 가면 黃海沿邊에 十二三千이라는 큰 들(野)이 잇는데 그들이 十二三千이라는 이름을 어든 由來에 關하야는 매우 자미스럽고 神秘한 傳說이 잇다 卽 녯날녯젹 高句麗時代에 엇던 王妃한 분이 잇는데 形軆가 奇異하야 乳房이 열둘이나 잇고 발이 사슴의 발과 가터서 別名을 鹿足夫人이라 하는데 하루에 十二兄弟를 生産함으로 王이 不祥의 兆라 하야 그 兒孩를 木凾에 느어서 西海에 웟더니 그 凾이 서 中國山東省 어느 地方에 이르럿섯다 그 엇던 中國사람이 望氣를 하고 그 木凾을 건저서 十二兒孩를 收養하얏더니 그 兒孩가 生長함애 膂力이 强大하고 智畧이 多하야 唐國의 大將이 되얏섯다 어느  그 十二大將은 各各三千大兵을 거나리고 高句麗를 侵犯하야 몬저 宣川의 身彌島를 占領하고 肅川地方지 이르럿섯다 그 高句麗王은 이 急報를 듯고 크게 놀내서 急히 群臣을 모와 防禦의 策을 議論할새 마참 鹿足夫人이 會議에 叅席하얏다가 敵將이 十二兄弟라는 말과 발이 鹿足과 갓다는 말을 듯고 心中에 自思하되 自己가 前日에 生産하야 버린 아들이 안인가 疑心하고 卽時 王 請하고 自己가 試驗的으로 그 十二大將을 懷柔하야 보겟다 하엿더니 王이 크게 깁버하야 곳 快諾하얏다 이에 鹿足夫人은 들에 나아가서 櫓樓를 設하고 臺上에 안저서 十二大將을 불너 臺下에 세우고 말하되 내가 일즉이 一胎에 十二兒를 나아서 海中에 버렷는데 그의 生死를 알지 못하야 恒常心中에 悲哀하엿더니 이제 드른즉 將軍이 十二兄弟오 한 발이 鹿足과 갓다하니 分明히 나의 아들인 것이라 萬一에 나이 말을 信聽치 안이 할 것 가트면 내가 장차 試驗하야 보리라 하고 卽時 손으로 乳房을 니 十二穴에서 一時에 젓이 나서 十二將軍의 입으로 드러가고  미리 預備하얏던 버선(襪) 十二足을 주니 그 발에다  만는지라 그 十二大將은 크게 놀나 鹿足夫人에게 一時에 절을 하고 에 업듸여서 말하되 小子 等이 海洋中에 漂流하야 父母의 所在를 알지 못하엿더니 이제 夫人의 말슴을 듯고  ＜76＞젓을 먹으며 버선을 신어보매 조곰도 差錯이 업스니 夫人은 眞實로 우리 母親이라 하고 이여 눈물을 흘이는지라 부인이 한 눈물을 흘이고 그의 손을 잡으며 등을 어르만지면서 말하되 너를 나흔 것도 天이오 너를 버린 것도 天이오 너를 만나게 된 것도 天이라 하니 十二將軍이 異口同聲으로 一齊히  말하되 나를 나신 이도 母오 나를 버리신 이도 母오 나를 젓주신 이도 母오 버선 주신 이도 母이니 母의 命을 엇지 敢히 拒逆하오며 母의 國을 엇지 敢히 侵犯하오릿가하고 卽時 兵을 罷하고 歸化하얏섯다 그럼으로 그들을 이름하야 十二三千이라 하고  그 十二將軍의 싸흔 古行城이 잇는데 (城은 亦是 海邊에 잇서 至今지 基址가 完然한데 長이 一萬八千八百十七尺) 그 地名을 古城里라 하며 그 母子의 相居하던 村을 悅歸里라 하얏다 한다
이 傳說은 肅川邑誌와 安州邑誌에 略記錄되얏고 又平壤誌에는 古代大聖山에 鹿足夫人이 잇서 九于를 一産하얏는대 (以下는 肅川邑誌와 相似故로 略) 罷兵後에 甲冑를 棄하고 大聖山에 還하야 龍菴을 奪取하야 居住하얏스니 今의 鹿水菴, 頭陀寺가 卽 그의 所終地라 云
◇桂月香과 玉介
壬辰亂時에 男女를 勿論하고 立節死義한 사람이 만히 잇지만은 몸이 賤役에 잇서서 能히 立節死義한 사람은 普州妓 論介와 平壤妓 桂月香이다 안이 이 두사람은만消極的으로 自己 몸만 犧牲에 供하야 節義를 立하얏슬 안이라 積極的으로 神鬼莫測의 奇絶妙絶한 計를 用하야 所謂腰下一劍으로 萬夫不當의 敵將을 斬하야 國難을 解하얏다 然而 論介의 事實은 昨年 本誌 慶南號에 畧錄하얏슨즉 讀者가 尙히 記憶할 것이다 그럼으로 여긔에는 但히 桂月香의 立節한 史實을 畧記하야 一般讀者의 叅考에 供코자 한다 却說 桂月香은 宣祖時代平壤府妓엿다 一名은 月仙이니 自少로 才華가 絶特하고 姿色이 甚佳하야 當時關西諸妓中第一人이라고 芳名이 藉藉하엿섯다 壬辰亂을 當하야 不幸이 平壤城이 陷落됨애 多數의 人民이 敵의 俘虜가 되는 同時에 그도 한 行長의 副將 小西飛의 捕虜가 되얏다 鳶이 안이오 魚가 안이어니 軟弱한 女子의 몸이 엇지 鐵瓮城가튼 敵陣을 脫出하리오 暫時의 義理와 節操를 생각하면 現場에서 卽時 花飛玉碎의 恨을 抱하고 永遠한 天國으로 돌아갓슬 것이다 그러나 智謀가 兼多한 그는 單純한 節義만 爲하야 즉는이보다는 暫時 屈辱을 當하고도 機會를 타서 敵을 圖함만갓지 못하다 생각하고 百方으로 敵의 歡心을 買하야 其疑를 解하얏다 一日은 良毅公 金景瑞(一名應瑞)가 城外에＜77＞서 習馬하든 것을 알고 (其時 金景瑞는 平壤巡別哨官으로 平素에 月香과 親分이 有함) 乙密臺附近에 가서 紙鳶戲를 좀 하겟다고 敵將에게 懇請한즉 敵將이 小毫도 疑치 안이하고 快諾하얏다 月香은 萬萬暗喜하고 乙密臺附近에 가서 紙鳶을 날녀 金景瑞의 陣中에 보내고 其鳶에다는 如此如此하라고 쓰섯다 金景瑞도 그 鳶을 잡아 보고서는 亦是 月香의 妙計를 알엇다 翌日에 景瑞가 城外에서  習馬를 하니 月香은 敵將과 共히 城中에 잇서서 城外를 觀望하다가 敵에게 泣請하되 自己의 男兄(올아비) 이 彼處에서 習馬를 하는데 一次面會를 하게 許하면 死無餘恨이라고 하얏다 敵將은 이것을  承諾하고 城中으로 불녀드렷다 敵將은 月香의 歡心을 得키 爲하야 特別優待를 하고  平素에도 無常出入할 事를 許하니 月香은 敵將이 自己의 妙計에 陷한 것을 心中暗喜하얏다 一日은 敵將이 宴會를 하는데 (其時 敵將이 大同舘에 居함) 月香이 酒를 强勸하야 醉倒케 하고 敵將의 宿睡함을 乘하야 綿絮로 帳鈴을 塞하고 (元來敵將이 多疑하야 帳에 鈴을 懸하고 人의 去來를 驗함) 出外하야 大聲으로 金景瑞를 招하니 景瑞가 長劍을 佩하고 城中을 越入하야 月香과 帳中으로 入하니 其時 敵將은 椅子에 據하야 方睡하는데 兩目을 尙張하고 紅色이 滿面하며 手에 雙劍을 持하야 人을 斫하랴는 것과 가텃다 景瑞는 猛然이 달녀들어 長釰으로 敵將을 斬하니 其頭가 임이 地에 落하얏스나 能히 釰을 斫하야 一은 壁에 着하고 一은 桂에 着하얏다 (大同舘柱에 釰痕이 尙有云) 景瑞가 其頭를 佩하고 月香을 負하야 城外로 出하다가 兩全치 못할줄을 知하고 月香에게 말하되 兩人이 皆死하는 이보다는 一人만 死하는 것이 올타하고 孰死孰生함이 可한 것을 물으매 月香은 自己가 死하기를 快然承諾하니 嗚呼 萬古의 義烈桂月香은 遂히 景瑞의 刀下에 可憐한 魂이 되얏다 (敵陣에서는 其翌日에서 始知함) 其後에 某監司가 그의 義를 壯히 思하야 影堂을 長慶門內에 立하얏더니 憲宗乙未에 監司 鄭元容이 다시 觀風洞에 義烈祠를 刱建하야 其像을 設하고 義烈碑를 立하얏스며 閔泳徽監司時에 한 此를 重建하고 其後府妓 金彩鸞이가 影幀을  設하얏다는데 其影堂에는 玉介와 配하얏스니 玉介는 亦是 平壤妓로 壬亂에 辱屈치 안이하고 墮城自經한이오 (閔泳徽가 亦立碑) 彩鸞은 元陽德妓生으로 忠壯公魚在淵의 妾이 되얏다가 丙寅洋擾에 江華에서 節死할 時에 金氏가 男服을 하고 矢石中에 入하야 魚公의 兄弟尸를 負하고 來하야 歸葬한 故로 當時政府에서 其義를 思하야 淑夫人을 封한이다 (後人이 다시 彩鸞의 影幀지 그 影堂에 設하야 至今에 三女子의 影幀이 依然이 有함) (靑吾記)＜78＞
