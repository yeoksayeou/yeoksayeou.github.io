Announcement

Simultaneously with elevating the Kanggye Branch Office (江界分社), which is developing day by day, to the Kanggye Branch (江界支社), we have newly employed Mr. Pak Taeyong (朴大用) as a reporter for the aforementioned branch.

Kaebyŏk Company <122>

**Summary**

This brief notice announces the administrative upgrade of the Kanggye office of the Kaebyok Company from a 'Branch Office' (分社 - Punsa) to a 'Branch' (支社 - Chisa), indicating growth or reorganization. Concurrently, it announces the hiring of Mr. Pak Taeyong as a reporter specifically for this upgraded Kanggye branch. From a historical perspective, this text shows the organizational expansion of a prominent Korean cultural and publishing entity (Kaebyok) into the provinces during the colonial period. The establishment of regional branches with dedicated reporters suggests an effort to broaden its network and potentially its news-gathering or distribution capabilities, reflecting the activities and development of Korean civil society institutions under Japanese rule.
