一月一言 (A Word for January)

Newspaper headlines say— even when a beautiful woman commits suicide, it's because society made her do it— even when a student is dissolute, it's society's fault. Even taking poison after heartbreak is society's fault, caused by social inequality. Laziness is also society's fault. Even murder is society's fault, and even killing one's father, the excuse is that the gloom of social life made him do it—.

You can't find words saying the individual's character is that of a seductress (妖婦), a vagrant (浮浪輩), or a wicked fellow; is this because "Newspaperism" (新聞主義) has developed? Or is it that Criminology (犯罪科学) has developed sideways? If society were truly eloquent (能言), one would know the truth or falsehood (眞否) of it—. <97>

**Summary**

The article critiques the contemporary trend in newspapers of attributing individual failings—ranging from suicide and dissolution to laziness and murder—entirely to societal problems or pressures. The author questions whether this tendency stems from sensationalist journalism ("Newspaperism") or a skewed development in the field of criminology, implying that individual character and responsibility are being ignored. From a historical perspective, this piece offers insight into media criticism during the Japanese colonial period in Korea. It reflects a debate about individual versus societal responsibility, possibly reacting against emerging deterministic or structural explanations for social issues, which might have been gaining traction. Historians might find it useful as an example of conservative or critical commentary on social discourse and media practices of the time.

一月一言

신문제목 왈- 미인이 자살을 해도 사회가 그를 그렇게 만들엇다고- 학생이 방탕해도 사회의 탓. 失戀 飮毒해도 사회불공평의 원인이라고 사회의 탓. 怠惰한 것도 사회의 탓. 살인을 해도 사회의 탓, 애비를 죽이고도 그 구실은 사회생활의 우울이 그를 그렇게 만들었다고-.
개인의 성격이 妖婦이며 부랑배며 고약한 놈이라는 말은 볼 수 없으니 이것은 新聞主義가 발달한 탓인가. 범죄과학이 측면으로 발달한 것인가. 사회가 能言이면 그 眞否를 알겟지만-. ＜97＞
