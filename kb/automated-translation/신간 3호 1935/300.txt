Brief Comments on the Financial World

The Extraordinary Diet Session and Rural Relief

Although the direct cause for convening the extraordinary Diet session held on the 27th of last month lies in countermeasures for the Kansai wind and flood damage—in reality, the urban reconstruction of places like Ōsaka and Kyōto—it is not only the Kansai disaster areas that cannot permit a moment's delay or neglect. The indescribable misery in the cold, drought, wind, and flood-stricken areas of Tōhoku, Hokkaidō, Hokuriku, Kyūshū, Shikoku, and Chōsen (Korea), especially the Samnam region (三南地方) of Chōsen, is also an urgent issue. Furthermore, the nationwide poor harvest due to the unprecedented collapse in cocoon prices and the resulting shortage of rice for meals are urgent problems requiring immediate relief. The reason the general public still holds interest in the Diet today, when national trust in political parties—and thus the Diet—has not recovered at all, is solely to monitor how the Diet—and the government—will handle this impoverished countryside.

This extraordinary Diet session should not be merely a Diet for localized damage countermeasures, but a Diet that deliberates and establishes fundamental measures for how to rescue and regenerate the entire rural population suffering thoroughly—which is an inevitable consequence under capitalism. If this rural countermeasure is treated, like today, as a problem that can be resolved with temporary patching and glossing over, rather than addressing the fundamental proposition of how to rebuild and break through the entirety trapped in dire straits, it is decidedly not such an incomplete issue. In other words, it is a prerequisite matter for deciding which direction this society should head towards in the future.

However, the government's countermeasures, as usual, do not escape the stopgap patching by even a single step, merely planning to spend a meager 170 million yen over three years. The established political parties pretend to be on the side of the people by criticizing this as "lukewarm," but ultimately intend to follow the government. As usual, through the tactic of expressing "dissatisfaction," they try to shift responsibility to the government and conceal their own incompetence. What the people absolutely must not forget is that they instantly invested 2.3 billion yen for the 4 billion yen damage from the Kantō earthquake centered on Tōkyō and Yokohama, and again, during the financial panic, they spent 700 million yen according to the Immediate Compensation Law to rescue capitalists from 700 million yen in damages.

Inflation Development?

Because Finance Minister Fujii, having supposedly followed Takahashi's financial policies, trampled on his own statements and adopted a tax increase plan amounting to an insufficient thirty million yen, the stock market felt terror, fell into chaos, and leading stocks all plummeted. Recently, it has regained calm, but the budget amount for the next fiscal year, assessed for compilation during Finance Minister Fujii's era, is an unprecedentedly huge sum of 2.2 billion yen. Along with Finance Minister Fujii's dismissal, the succeeding Finance Minister is Takahashi Korekiyo. Therefore, as the two are like one body, the financial policy will likely remain unchanged. Due to such a huge budget, inflation, low interest rates, deficit financing, etc., will truly become full-scale. Regarding this, inflation is a reaction against sound finance.

**Summary**

This article critiques the Japanese government's inadequate response to widespread rural distress in 1935, contrasting the meager proposed aid (170 million yen over 3 years) for nationwide agricultural crises (caused by natural disasters and plummeting cocoon prices) with the swift, massive bailouts previously provided for the Kantō earthquake (2.3 billion yen) and capitalist losses during the financial panic (700 million yen). The author dismisses the government's plan as a mere stopgap measure and criticizes established political parties for feigning opposition while ultimately supporting the government. The piece also notes the appointment of Takahashi Korekiyo as Finance Minister, predicting continued large budgets, deficit spending, and consequently, worsening inflation. From a Korean colonial history perspective, the explicit mention of Chōsen (Korea) and specifically its southern provinces (Samnam Chibang) as areas suffering extreme hardship alongside regions in Japan proper is significant. It highlights how Korea's economic distress was viewed (or presented) as part of the broader empire's problems, yet also underscores the perceived disparity in relief efforts, potentially fueling resentment or critique of colonial economic policies and resource allocation. Historians might find the comparison of relief amounts and the commentary on financial policy (inflation fears linked to deficit spending) valuable for understanding the socio-economic conditions and political discourse affecting both Japan and its colony during this period.

財界短評
臨時議會와 農村救濟
客月二十七日에 開催된 臨時議會召集의 直接導因은 關西風水害對策-그 實은 大阪, 京都等의 都市復興-에 잇는바이지만 그러나 一刻의 猶餘, 放置를 許하지안는 것은 다만 關西風水害地뿐이아니라 東北, 北海道, 北陸, 九州, 四國, 朝鮮等의 冷, 旱, 風 水害地(朝鮮은 特히 三南地方)는 말할수업는 慘狀이다. 그리고 未曾有의 繭價大暴落에 依한 窮狀全國的凶作과 飯米饑饌과는 卽刻救濟를 要할 緊急한 問題이다. 政黨-따러 議會에 對한 國民的信賴가 조곰도 恢復되지 안흔 今日 아직도 議會에 一般이 關心을 가지고 잇는 것은 實로이窮迫한 農村으 如何히 議會가-政府가 取扱하랴는가의 監視에 不外하다.

今囘의 臨時議會는 單只局地的被害對策을 爲한 議會가될것이아니오 徹底的으로 웅얼을 입는-그것은 資本主義下의 必然的歸趨인-全農村을 如何히 匡救하고 更生케할가의 根本對策을 審議樹立(?)할가의 議會이어야 할 것이다. 萬若이 農村對策은 今日과가티 窮境에 陷한 全體를 如何히 再建打開할지의 根本命題의 槓桿이되는 것으로 一時的糊塗瀰縫으로써 解決할수잇다는 그런 不徹底한 問題는 斷定코아니다. 말하자면 이 社會를 어듸로 向하게할가가 今後進路를 決定하기 爲한 前提案件인 것이다.

그런데 政府의 對策은 例에 依하야 姑息的瀰縫를 一步도 脫出치안어 三年間에 겨우 一億七十萬圓을 支出하랴는데 不過하다. 旣成政黨은 此로서 「微溫的」이라고 論難攻擊함에 依하야 國民의 便인듯키 假裝하지만 結局은 政府에 追隨하랴고한다. 例와 如히 「不滿」의 技巧에 依하야 責任을 政府로 轉嫁하야 自作의 無能力을 陰蔽하랴고한다 國民이 斷然히 잇지못할 것은 彼等은일즉이 東京, 橫濱을 中心으로한 關東震災四十億被害에 對하야 卽刻으로 二十三億을 投하엿고 다시 金融恐慌에 際하야는 七億圓의 資本家被害를 救하랴고 卽時補償法에 依하야 七億圓을 支出한 것을  (二行不得已畧)
「인풀레」發展?
藤井藏相이 高橋財政을 踏襲한바는 聲明을 蹂躝하고 不足■齒의 三千萬圓程度의 增稅案을 採用하엿다는 바람에 株式市場이 恐怖를 눗기며 混亂에 陷하야 花形株는 一切暴落을하고말엇다 그랫다가 近日에와서 平靜을 恢復하엿는데 이제 藤井藏相時代에 編成키로 査定된 明年度豫算額은 從來未曾有의 巨額인 二十二億圓이다 藤井藏相의 更送과아울러 後任藏相은 高橋是淸氏이다 그럼으로 畢身同體와가튼 兩者間이만큼 財政策은 變함이업슬 것이다. 이가튼 尨大한 豫算關係로 인풀레숀, 低金利, 赤字財政等이 그야말로 本格化할 것이다. 여기 對하야 인풀레숀은 健金財政의 反動이다.
