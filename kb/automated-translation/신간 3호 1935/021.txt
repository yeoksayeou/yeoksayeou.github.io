**Special Company Announcement**

Our company, which publishes many publications each month, has intended for some time to unify the writing system according to the "Hangul Unification Plan" (「한글」統一案), but this too did not happen quickly, for which we felt sorry towards our readers. Now, since the publication of the *Kaebyŏk* (開闢) journal, preparations have reached a certain degree, and we already began implementation starting from the previous month's issue. Henceforth, we will make special efforts regarding the spelling rules, and we especially hope that all contributors and submitters will particularly understand this point and write according to the "Hangul Unification."

**Summary**

This announcement from the Kaebyŏk Publishing Company informs readers that, after some delay, the company has begun implementing the standardized Hangul orthography ("Hangul Unification Plan") in its publications, starting with the previous issue of *Kaebyŏk* magazine. They apologize for the delay, pledge further effort in adhering to the new spelling rules, and request that contributors also adopt the unified system. For historians, this notice is interesting as it reflects the active efforts towards language standardization and modernization of written Korean under Japanese colonial rule, specifically the adoption of the 1933 Hangul Unified Orthography Plan (한글 마춤법 통일안), even by private publishers. It highlights the practical challenges and the gradual process of implementing such linguistic reforms.
