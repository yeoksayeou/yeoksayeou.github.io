The Úrhae Abdication and the Restoration Movement of the Six Ministers, 500 Years of Korean Factional Strife [3]
						Hong Mok-ch'un

Going to Kim Chong-sŏ's house, he struck down both father and son at once. Continuing on, he reached the palace of Prince Consort Yŏngyang, summoned the hundred officials, and carried out a *massacre, bringing down the curtain on an act of bloody rain and foul wind. With this, the elders of the court, the ministers entrusted with the late king's command (顧命), and other loyal senior statesmen and officials were annihilated in one fell swoop, and the great power of the realm returned to the hands of Grand Prince Suyang (首陽大君) overnight. Even if Suyang had driven out the young king right then and there and ascended to the Great Throne, who could have possibly obstructed him? However, considering that the hearts of the people within the country might not submit was a cause for concern, and furthermore, he greatly feared that if the court of the Ming (明) Dynasty, served as the superior country, learned of this, there would be an inquiry and censure. Thus, the issue of usurpation (簒位) was set aside as homework for some time, filed away for later consideration. For the time being, while settling the massacre issue, he decided to place his partisans (羽翼) in key positions inside and outside the government to consolidate power. Thereupon, alleging that Grand Prince Anp'yŏng (安平大君), along with his son Ujik (友直), had conspired to usurp the throne and that Kim Chong-sŏ and others had adhered to him, they pinned the title of heinous treason (惡逆) onto the dead men, concocted a baseless criminal case, promulgated (頒布) it throughout the land, and recorded the merits. To Suyang and his followers, they bestowed the commendable merit title (勳號) of 『Meritorious Subject Who Rectified Loyalty, Upheld Righteousness, Corrected the State, Assisted the Throne, Determined Policy, and Pacified Difficulty (奪忠仗義匡國輔祚定策靖難功臣)』, had their portraits (影像) painted on the walls of the Office of Meritorious Subjects (忠勳府), and held a grand banquet to feast the various meritorious subjects. <1> At this time, extolling (袞揚) Suyang's virtuous deeds and meritorious labors, comparing him to the Duke of Zhou, Ji Dan (周公 姬旦), with the highest level words of praise and admiration (嘆美詞), a royal edict (敎書) was granted by the king. Yu Sŏng-wŏn (柳誠源), a scholar of the Hall of Worthies (集賢殿), happened to be at his post and was summoned to receive the order to compose (製述) it. Scholar Yu, being one of the 'Six Martyred Ministers (死六臣)' who participated in the restoration movement the following day, was a senior figure of loyalty and righteous indignation (忠義慷慨). How could he have enjoyed composing this text? However, being the king's personal command, he could not refuse. After drafting the royal edict, he returned home, wept (慟哭) all day, and lamented, "How can the misfortune of learning to read and recognize characters be like this?" it is said. During the Jianwen (建文) calamity in Ming China, when the King of Yan, Zhu Di (燕王 棣), summoned the great Confucian scholar Fang Xiaoru (方孝孺) and ordered him to draft the edict of ascension (登極詔), Fang wept bitterly and refused (痛哭不肯). When pressed repeatedly, he finally seized the brush and wrote in large characters the four words: "Yan Rebel Usurps Throne (燕賊簒位)." Although Scholar Yu's situation was similar to Master Fang's, one was fiercely resolute like that, causing the King of Yan to hang his head in dejection, while the other drafted the text against his will. However, not only was the 'Edict Conferring Merit (策勳敎書)' vastly different from an 'Edict of Ascension (登極詔)', but also because the current King Tanjong (端宗) was sitting on the throne and gave the command, he could not disobey. In any case, Master Yu was extremely unfortunate even as a man of letters.

Hŏ Hu (許詡), Left Vice-Premier (左參贊) of the State Council (議政府), was the son of Premier Hŏ Cho (許稠). His father, with his pure virtue (淸德) and high reputation (峻望), had served as Left State Councilor during King Sejong's (世宗) reign, contributing to the praised 30-year era of Great Peace, and his esteemed name was widespread. Hŏ Hu also resembled his father (克肖), being gentle, upright, and extremely filial from a young age, possessing outstanding talent and great renown. King Sejong and King Munjong (文宗) greatly trusted him, treating him with favor (寵遇) as a key retainer (股肱). He received King Munjong's dying command (顧命) and, along with Hwangbo In (皇甫仁) and others, had been assisting the young ruler. When King Munjong's state funeral ended and Grand Prince Suyang was appointed chief envoy (上使) for the succession request mission (承襲奏請) and was about to depart for Yanjing (燕京 - Beijing), Hŏ Hu calmly (從容히) met with Suyang and said, "Currently, His Majesty is young in years, and the state's situation is precarious. As the senior elder of the closest royal kin, instead of staying in the palace to protect the young king, Your Highness is traveling far away on a ten-thousand-li mission. I do not think this is right. I wish that you would entrust the envoy duties to another and not leave the young king's side, thereby pacifying and reassuring (鎭撫) the hearts of the people." Suyang did not listen to his entreaty, but from then on, he thought, "Hŏ is someone who cares for me," and felt grateful in his heart. Therefore, even when the bloody drama of the massacre (鏖殺) occurred, although Kwŏn Ram's (權擥) faction recorded his name on the death list (死簿) intending to kill him, Suyang did not permit it, and Hŏ escaped the calamity of that day. Now, when the banquet for meritorious subjects was held at the State Council, amidst the alternating performances of clear songs and exquisite dances, the slightly intoxicated group including Chŏng In-ji (鄭麟趾) and Han Hwak (韓確) clapped their hands and cheered joyfully (撫掌驩呼), brimming with self-satisfaction, reaching the extreme of arrogance, self-indulgence, violence, and disrespect (驕恣暴慢). Hŏ, however, sat upright alone in a corner, neither speaking nor smiling. When the cup came around (巡盃), he cited a personal observance (私忌) and did not drink. Though delicacies (珍錯) filled the table, he never once put down his chopsticks (下箸), merely remaining sad and unhappy (愀然不樂). Then, when a certain person proposed to Suyang that the severe punishment of decapitation and public display of the head, along with execution of the family (梟示孥戮), be applied to Kim Chong-sŏ and the others, Hŏ, weeping慨然流涕, earnestly remonstrated (挽諫), saying, "They were all former officials of the previous reign, and their ranks were already high (놉핫스니). How could they have harbored such unfathomable intentions? Even supposing they had malicious hearts, their bodies have already been executed (誅斬), and thus the crime has been dealt with. Now, to add the punishment of executing the family (孥戮) <2> is excessively harsh. Not only does it contravene the late king's original intention of lenient punishment, expressed as 'punishment does not extend to descendants (罰不及嗣)', but excessive executions and killings are fundamentally not something for an enlightened era to undertake. It is right (올타) to stop," he insisted. Grand Prince Suyang, who had been watching his actions for some time and had grown suspicious and angry upon seeing him refuse wine and meat, now heard these words and shouted, "As a high official, how can you shield (斗護) the rebel faction and obstruct public consensus?" He then added sharply, with a fierce expression, "I understand the intention behind your feigned excuse for refusing wine." Hŏ slowly replied, "The elders of the court have all met their end (畢命) at once. I, too, am an old relic from the previous reigns, so it is already unexpected that I haven't died. What heart would I have to enjoy myself with wine and meat?" Upon finishing his words, he sighed deeply. Suyang was greatly angered and intended to kill him, but considering his usual talent, virtue, and public reputation, he pardoned him and let the matter drop. However, his enemies, fearing and jealous that he might be appointed to an important position, then slandered and falsely accused (讒構) him in numerous ways, had him exiled to a distant place, and later sent someone to strangle him (縊殺). From this one incident alone, one can understand how avaricious for talent and eager to kill the utilitarian faction that adhered to Suyang was at that time, harming innocent people and acting outrageously.

Grand Prince Suyang served as Chief State Councilor (領議政), effectively carrying out the duties of the monarch, for three years. Not only were officials at home and abroad all submitting in fear (慴伏) to his authority, daring not even to look up at him, but Suyang, who would later ascend the throne and leave various achievements in domestic governance and foreign relations, possessed outstanding skill, employed (驅使) talented individuals, and brought about reforms in government decrees. Consequently, those singing his praises and extolling his virtues (謳歌頌德) also increased, and those wishing him to become king were not limited to just his close advisors. Furthermore, the young king was now gradually growing older, reaching the age of 15. Possessing a precocious (夙成) nature and with his sagacity (睿智) developing daily, his brilliant and benevolent capacity seemed no less than that of Sejong or Munjong. The king's daily maturation was naturally disadvantageous for Suyang. Therefore, Han Myŏng-hoe (韓明澮) constantly urged Suyang to carry out the great matter swiftly, while Chŏng In-ji's faction maneuvered internally and externally. Consequently, on the 11th day of the intercalary 6th month of the Úrhae year (乙亥), the 3rd year of Tanjong's reign, the king presided (御) at the Kyŏnghoeru Pavilion (慶會樓), summoned his uncle, Grand Prince Suyang, and handed over the Royal Seal (璽寶), saying,
"I am young and sickly and cannot remain in this position. Although it is burdensome for you, Uncle, there is no choice (밧게 업소) but for you to advance to the throne and become the master of the ancestral shrine and state."
Thus, the young king stepped down to become King Emeritus (上王), and Suyang succeeded (니여) his nephew as the new king. Whether this event reflected the true intention of the King Emeritus or not is beside the point. In any case, on the surface and formally, it was a proper and just abdication (禪讓). Moreover, right there, Suyang kowtowed and prostrated himself (叩首俯伏) repeatedly, firmly refusing and persistently declining (固辭牢讓) to the very end. Tanjong, conversely, wept (涕泣) and said, "Although Uncle firmly declines out of loyalty and sincerity, this may be a virtue of humility for you personally, but what about the foundation established by our ancestors and the lives of the people?" Weeping profusely (聲淚俱下), he transferred the Great Seal (大寶). Suyang, unable to refuse further, reluctantly accepted the royal command. Thus, the drama of usurpation (簒位劇), secretly plotted in back rooms late at night for many years, was performed under the bright light of day, beautified in this manner <3> to deceive people's eyes and ears. However, until formal recognition was obtained from the Ming Emperor, it was not safe no matter what. Therefore, in the following 7th month, Minister of Rites (禮曹判書) Kim Ha (金河) and Minister of Punishments (刑曹判書) U Hyo-gang (禹孝岡) were appointed as special envoys and sent to Beijing (北京) with the King Emeritus's memorial of abdication (表文):
"(Excerpt) When my late father, King Kongsun (恭順王 - Munjong), passed away, I was twelve years old. Inheriting the throne as a child, I knew not what to do. All myriad affairs were entrusted to the officials. In the 4th year of Jingtai (景泰), treacherous ministers plotted rebellion, and calamity was imminent. My uncle, your humble servant Grand Prince Suyang (首陽大君) Yu (瑈 - Sejo's given name), rushed to inform me and immediately suppressed it. However, the wicked remnants were not eradicated, incidents continued one after another, and the people's hearts were uneasy. With my frailty, it was truly difficult to maintain stability. The security of the state altars is of utmost importance. My late father's younger brother, Yu (瑈), is learned in matters ancient and modern, possesses merits and virtue, and truly commands popular trust. On the [day] day of the [month] month of the [year] year, I ordered him to temporarily assume responsibility for military and state affairs. I humbly hope Your Sagacious Majesty will perceive this clearly and specially grant your bright approval."
In response to this, Emperor Jingtai (景泰) of Ming issued an edict (詔勅):
"Scrupulously observe the loyalty of a vassal (臣節), further strengthen the sincerity of serving the great power, eternally secure the vassal state (藩邦), and do not disgrace the abdication of the successor king (嗣王). Let [King Emeritus's posthumous name] continue with his title and live in retirement (閑居). You must constantly accord him preferential treatment (優待), daring not to be negligent in any way."
This was strongly emphasized (申筋 - likely 申飭, admonished). With this, Tanjong retired to Suganggung Palace (壽康宮) (present-day Changgyeongwon - 昌慶苑), not to enjoy old age but to pass his youth. Where in the world, past or present, could there be a 15-year-old Great King Emeritus (太上王)? If the Joseon Dynasty (李朝) had adopted the system inherited (遺制) from the Goryeo Dynasty (高麗朝), where, for example, after King Munjong, Sejo (世祖) (Suyang) had ascended, and after Sejo, another royal brother or Tanjong had succeeded, then a mature king would always have been on the throne, state affairs would not have been neglected, and perhaps the numerous tragedies of the royal palace would not have occurred. In the aspect that bloody and tragic incidents between flesh and blood (骨肉) relatives fighting over the throne were rare, the historical record (史紀) of the Goryeo Dynasty has a very bright aspect.

When the uncle and nephew, Tanjong and Suyang, were contending over the Jade Seal (玉璽) at the Kyŏnghoeru Pavilion, one firmly yielding, the other firmly refusing, Sŏng Sam-mun (成三問), a scholar of the Hall of Worthies serving as Royal Secretary for Rites (禮房承旨 - like a combination of modern Chief Secretary of the Ministry of the Imperial Household (內大臣府) and Minister of Ceremonies (式部長官)), witnessed this and could not contain his sorrow, feeling as if his twisting innards (九曲肝腸) were being cut to pieces (寸斷). As he was attending beside the monarch (君側), he could not cry out loud, but hot tears naturally streamed down (滂沱), soaking his robe sleeve (袍袖). Suyang, while prostrating himself and declining, frequently raised his head to look askance (脾晲) at Sam-mun, but Sam-mun acted as if he did not see and left his place, approaching the railing (欄頭) and looking down (瞰下) at the Lotus Pond (蓮池), intending in his heart to embrace the Royal Seal and plunge to his death in the pond.
His close friend Pak P'aeng-nyŏn (朴彭年) noticed this, quickly followed him, quietly restrained him (挽止), and brought him back to his position. Although the ceremony that day concluded without incident, the Duke's (referring to Sŏng Sam-mun, likely using an honorific) resentment and discontent were considerable.
"For what reason did you grab and stop me from dying?"
"Because dying in vain is useless (徒死無益)."
"Now that things have come to this, what else is there to do but die?"
"Dying can be done anytime; it's not too late (늣지 아니한). Besides, although the King Emeritus has relinquished the throne, he is still young in years, and his future is extremely long (만흐신데). If we die first, what shall become of him?"
"Then, do you mean to carry out a restoration movement (復辟運動)?"
"Of course, it's more than just that. No matter how decadent the human heart is in these final days, if we search, there will still remain loyal ministers and righteous scholars who cannot forget (잇지 못하는) the grace of the former king. Let's gather comrades and devise a plan (꿈여보세). If we succeed <4>, it will be due to the spiritual power of the ancestors and the great fortune of the King Emeritus. If not, we will simply offer (밧처) the lives of our entire families together to repay the profound kindness and recognition of the former king. Therefore, let's not die now."
Sŏng clasped his hand, weeping, and said:
"Brother, you are truly my teacher. Then let's temporarily postpone dying and plan the great undertaking."
Thus, the secret plot for restoration was agreed upon between the two young scholars on the very day of Tanjong's abdication.
Originally, Sŏng Sam-mun was the son of Commander-in-Chief (都總管) Sŏng Sŭng (成勝), and Pak P'aeng-nyŏn was the son of Minister of Punishments (刑曹判書) Pak Chung-rim (朴仲林). Both gentlemen were descendants of renowned noble families (貴家). From their youth (蛋年 - possibly 弱年, 'youth'), their literary talent and scholarship were outstanding (뛰여나고) in the generation, and they possessed great loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and a pure, elegant reputation, praised as pure gold and fine jade. Barely past the age of twenty (弱冠), they passed the state examination (登科) one after the other during King Sejong's reign and held positions as royal attendants (侍從). The King cherished their talent and virtue, and his trust and favor grew daily. At that time, the Hall of Worthies housed brilliant talents capable of standing against a thousand, such as Sin Suk-chu (申叔舟), Ha Wi-ji (河緯地), Ch'oe Hang (崔恒), I Kae (李塏), I Sŏk-hyŏng (李石亨), I Sŭng-so (李承召), Sŏ Kŏ-jŏng (徐居正), Yu Sŏng-wŏn (柳誠源), Kang Hŭi-an (姜希顔), Sŏng Im (成任), and Pak Wŏn-hyŏng (朴元享), but the two gentlemen Sŏng and Pak, along with Sin Suk-chu, were especially beloved and esteemed by the King, who always treated them like his own family members and sons. When Munjong resided in the Eastern Palace (as Crown Prince), he discussed classics, history, philosophy, and literature with them day and night, received them with the etiquette due to friends, and called them by their courtesy names (字), Kŭnbo (謹甫 - Sŏng Sam-mun) and Sain (仕叟 - Pak P'aeng-nyŏn). During Tanjong's time as the royal grandson, Sejong would personally hold him in his arms while strolling in the palace hall, look at the scholars, and say:
"After my hundred years pass, you must love and protect this child (兒孩) just as you did when I was alive."
When such solemn and sincere (懇側) requests were made, they could not help but bow their heads to the ground (頓首) and weep. One day in his later years, King Munjong, despite being unwell (靡寧), summoned them to his inner chamber (臥內), gave them wine until late at night, conversed intimately (娓娓히 酬酌) with them, and said:
"Talking with you refreshes (爽快) my mind, and I forget my illness."
Seeing them too drunk to rise, he would order court ladies to carry them by stretcher (擔舁) to their posts, give them bedding (衾褥) used by the king, and prepare tea or medicinal soup (茶湯) to quench their thirst after sobering up. Each time, they were deeply moved by this special grace (殊恩), and when they met, they encouraged each other in loyalty and righteousness, pledging to repay it with their lives. At that time, which court official did not weep with gratitude for the gracious favor of the two great kings? However, the scholars of the Hall of Worthies, in particular, received the bond of true friendship (知己之誼) amidst this special favor. Now, although most of the scholars from that time rushed to join (馳參) Suyang's ranks (麾下), only Messrs. Sŏng, Pak, and others exclusively offered (捧) their solitary loyalty to Tanjong, preserving the pine-and-cypress-like integrity of true heroes.

當年叩馬敢言非
大義堂堂日月輝
草木亦霑周雨露
愧君猶食首陽薇

(That year, stopping the horse, they dared speak against wrong;
Great righteousness, majestic, shone like sun and moon.
Even plants and trees were moistened by Zhou's rain and dew;
I feel shame for you, who still ate Shouyang's ferns.)

This poem is a seven-character quatrain composed by Master Sŏng Sam-mun while passing the shrine of Boyi (伯夷) and Shuqi (叔齊) located at the *River (河 - likely the Yellow River or a significant river en route) during an envoy mission to Beijing. The first two lines <5> praise their act of bravely stopping the horse (叩馬) of King Wu of Zhou (周武王) as he marched to attack Yin (伐殷) and forcefully arguing that it was wrong for a subject to attack his sovereign, saying their awe-inspiring righteousness contends with the sun and moon for brilliance. The last two lines describe how Boyi and Shuqi, seeing that King Wu would not listen, departed aloofly. Later, when King Wu defeated Yin, King Zhou (紂王) died by self-immolation, and the realm's territory (版圖) fell to Zhou, they disdained (不屑) even eating the grain produced in the land of Zhou. Consequently, they entered Mount Shouyang (首陽山), living by gathering ferns (採薇) until their lives ended (告終). While narrating this, the poem critiques them: If they were avoiding Zhou, they should have gone outside the territory ruled by the King of Zhou. Why did they go to Mount Shouyang, which was reached (밋치는) by Zhou's rain and dew? If it was thus generally his territory, how could you, who were ashamed to eat (耻食) Zhou's grain (粟), eat Zhou's ferns (薇)? I rather feel ashamed and regretful (愧恨) for you, who tried to forcefully differentiate (달니하랴) between grain and ferns, which are not particularly different. The poem itself leans too heavily on theory and lacks (乏少) a flavor of loyal sincerity. However, Boyi and Shuqi, whose noble integrity and outstanding conduct (高節卓行) have left a fragrant reputation for posterity (流芳), were praised by Mencius (孟子) as the "pure among sages," and Han Yu (韓愈) lauded them as unique figures in ten thousand ages. To criticize (褒貶) such people is impossible without possessing integrity exceeding theirs. Yet now, our Master Sŏng established moral integrity (風節) that would make even Boyi and Shuqi feel ashamed, becoming a model (龜鑑) for subjects of all ages. Is this not also magnificent? Through this single quatrain, one can still vaguely imagine (髣髴) the master's thoughts and demeanor even after a thousand years. <6>

**Summary**

This article, part three of a series on Korean factional strife, details the consolidation of power by Grand Prince Suyang following his 1453 coup (Gyeyu Jeongnan). It describes the initial purge of officials loyal to the young King Tanjong, the justification of the coup through fabricated treason charges against figures like Kim Chong-sŏ, and the rewarding of Suyang's followers. The narrative highlights the principled but ultimately fatal resistance of Hŏ Hu. The core of the article focuses on the coerced abdication (乙亥禪位 - Úrhae Sŏnwi) of King Tanjong in 1455 and Suyang's ascension as King Sejo, portraying it as a carefully staged event designed to appear legitimate, including seeking formal recognition from Ming China. Immediately following the abdication, the article recounts the secret pact made between Sŏng Sam-mun and Pak P'aeng-nyŏn, two loyal scholars deeply indebted to the previous kings (Sejong and Munjong), to launch a movement (復辟運動) to restore Tanjong to the throne, setting the stage for the tragedy of the Six Martyred Ministers (死六臣).

From the perspective of Korean colonial history (published in 1935), this article is interesting for its focus on a pivotal moment of internal political upheaval involving usurpation, loyalty, and resistance. By recounting the story of the Six Martyred Ministers' nascent plot against a powerful usurper, the author implicitly foregrounds themes of unwavering loyalty to a legitimate ruler (even a deposed one) and righteous opposition to unjust power, which could resonate with Korean readers under Japanese rule. The comparison with Chinese historical parallels (Fang Xiaoru) serves to elevate the Korean figures and events, placing them within a shared Confucian moral framework while emphasizing Korean agency and historical distinctiveness. The critique of the Joseon succession system compared to Goryeo's might also subtly reflect on contemporary power structures.

乙亥禪位와 六臣의 復辟運動, 朝鮮黨爭五百年史[3]
						洪木春
金宗瑞에 집에 가서 그의 부자를 일시에 擊殺하고 계속하야 寧陽尉宮中에 니르러 百官을 불너듸려 *殺을 행하야 血雨腥風의 일막이 끗나니 이에 조정의 원로와 先朝의 顧命을 받은 大臣이며 기타 忠義잇는 宿德卿宰들이 일시에 殲滅되고 천하의 大權은 一夜 사이에 首陽大君의 수중에 도라 갓습니다. 首陽은 그 자리에서 幼沖한 인군을 모라내고 大位에 오른다 하야도 뉘가 능히 阻遏할 수 업지만은 그리고 보면 국내의 人心이 不服할 것도 可慮인데다가 더욱 上國으로 服事하는 明나라 조정에서 이것을 알게되면 문책의 擧가 잇슬 것이 매우 두려웟습니다. 그리하야 簒位問題는 어늬 시기까지 숙제로 삼어 留案하기로 하고 爲先 虐殺問題를 결말짓는 일방으로 內外要職에 그 羽翼을 배치하야 권력을 收攬하기로 하얏습니다. 이에 安平大君이 그 아들 友直과 함께 王位簒奪의 음모를 하고 金宗瑞 等이 그에게 趨附하얏다는 이유로 죽은 사람에게 다시 惡逆의 名을 씨워 허무한 罪案을 꿈여 中外에 頒布하고 그 공을 錄하야 首陽 이하에게 『奪忠仗義匡國輔祚定策靖難功臣』이라는 갸륵한 勳號를 내리고 忠勳府壁上에 影像을 圖畵하며 大宴을 設하야 諸功臣을 享하얏습니다.＜1＞ 이 때 首陽에게 그 功德과 勳勞를 袞揚하야 周公 姬旦에게 比擬하는 最高級의 嘆美詞로써 왕의 敎書를 賜給하는데 集賢殿 學士 柳誠源이란 이가 맛츰 直所에 잇다가 불녀드러 製述의 命을 받엇습니다. 柳學士는 다음날 復辟運動에 참가하야 『死六臣』의 한사람이 된 이 만치 忠義慷慨한 선배입니다. 그가 이 글을 製述하기를 엇지 즐겻스리오만은 왕의 親命인 이상에 엇지하지 못하야 敎書를 起草한 뒤에 집에 도라와 종일 慟哭하며 『讀書識字의 累가 엇지 이러하뇨』 하야 長嘆하얏다 합니다. 明나라 建文禍變 때에 燕王 棣가 巨儒方孝孺를 불너드려 登極詔를 草하라니까 그는 痛哭不肯하다가 再三强要함에 니르러 드듸여 奪筆大書한 것이 『燕賊簒位』의 四字엿습니다. 그 때 柳學士의 所遭가 方先生과 유사함에 불구하고 하나는 저와 가티 烈烈하야 燕王으로 垂頭喪氣케 하고 하나는 본의 아인 그 글을 草하얏스나 그것은 『策勳敎書』가  『登極詔』가 懸殊할뿐 아니라 현재 端宗이 位에 안저 명하신 때문에 違拒치 못한 것이 올시다. 여하튼지 柳先生은 文人으로도 극히 불행하얏습니다.

議政府 左參贊 許詡는 政丞 許稠의 아들인데 그 부친이 淸德과 峻望으로 世宗朝의 左義政으로 30년 太平之治를 찬양하야 賢名이 洋溢하얏섯는데 그도 乃父에 克肖하야 少時부터 溫厚謹直하고 事親至孝하야 茂才와 重名이 잇섯습니다. 世宗과 文宗이 크게 신임하야 股肱으로써 寵遇하섯습니다. 그는 文宗의 顧命을 받어 皇甫仁 等과 함께 幼主를 輔導하야 오더니 文宗의 大葬이 끗나고 首陽大君이 承襲奏請의 上使가 되여 燕京에 赴하게 된 때에 그는 從容히 首陽을 보고 『지금 上監이 春秋가 어리시고 國勢가 孤危하거늘 大君이 宗室至親의 尊長으로 왕궁에 머물너 幼君을 보호치 안으시고 멀니 萬里에 出使하시니 나는 그것이 올흔 줄로 생각치 아니한 즉 원컨대 使任은 타인의게 미루시고 幼君의 側을 떠나지 마러 인심을 鎭撫하소서』 하얏습니다. 首陽은 그의 勸請을 듯지 못하얏스나 伊來로 『許某는 나를 사랑하는 사람이다.』하야 마음으로 감사하얏습니다. 그럼으로 鏖殺의 活劇이 잇슬 때에도 權擥의 무리는 그를 死簿에 錄名하야 죽이랴 하얏스나 首陽이 許치 아니하야 그 날의 화를 면하얏더니 이 때에 相府에 功臣宴이 設行될새 淸歌妙舞가 迭奏하는 사이에 微醉를 帶한 鄭麟趾, 韓確의 무리가 撫掌驩呼하며 득의양양하야 驕恣暴慢의 限을 極하는데 詡는 홀노 一隅에 端坐하야 不言不笑하고 巡盃가 오면 私忌에 託하야 飮치 안코 珍錯이 탁상에 가득하나 일차도 下箸치 아니하며 오즉 愀然不樂하고 잇섯습니다. 그리하다가 某人이 首陽께 對하야 金宗瑞 以下에게 梟示孥戮의 重典을 쓰자고 제의한즉 그는 慨然流涕하며 挽諫하야 갈오되 『그들이 모다 先朝舊臣으로 爵位가 임의 놉핫스니 엇지 그와 같은 不測한 心事를 가젓슬 것이며 設使 惡心이 잇섯다 하야도 그 몸을 임의 誅斬하얏스니 이로써 罪는 다스린 것이거늘 이제 다시 孥戮의 典을 加하는 것은＜2＞ 넘우 과혹한 일이오. 先王의 『罰不及嗣』라는 寬刑의 本意에 背馳될 뿐더러 刑殺太甚이 원래 昭代의 할 일이 아니니 그만두는 것이 올타』고 주장하얏습니다. 首陽大君은 俄前부터 그의 행동을 주시하야 飮酒食肉치 안는 것을 보고 疑怒가 생긴 위에 이제 그런 말을 듯고 『大官의 몸으로 엇지 逆黨을 斗護하야 公議를 沮止하느냐.』 一喝하고 다시 『그대가 託故辭酒하든 心事를 了解하노라』하야 辭色이 猛厲하얏습니다. 그는 서서히 『조정의 원로가 일시에 畢命하얏스니 나도 또한 先朝때 부터의 舊物인즉 죽지 안은 것이 임의 의외의 일인데 또 무슨 마음으로 酒肉으로쩌 暢快하리오』 言罷에 길게 太息하얏습니다. 首陽은 크게 怒하야 죽이랴 하다가 그의 平日才德과 人望을 생각하고 赦하야 不問에 附하얏더니 그의 怨敵들이 그가 중용될가 忌畏하야 이에 百方으로 讒構하야 遠地에 유배하고 다시 사람을 보내여 縊殺하얏습니다. 이 一事로 보와도 首陽에게 歸附한 그 때의 功利派들이 얼마나 忌才貪殺하야 무고히 사람을 害하고 傍若無人의 행동을 한 것을 알것이외다.

首陽大君이 領議政으로 잇서 사실상 君王의 일을 집행한지가 3년에 이르럿습니다. 中外가 모다 그 威權에 慴伏하야 감히 仰視치 못할 뿐아니라 首陽은 후일에 왕위에 올나 內治와 外交에 가지가지의 공적을 남긴이 만티 탁월한 수완이 잇고 호걸을 驅使하야 政令이 一新하게되니 謳歌頌德하는 者도 느러 그의 인군되시기를 바라는 사람이 다만 幕僚뿐이 아니엿습니다. 그뿐 아니라 幼沖의 君王도 이제는 春秋가 점점 자라나서 15세가 되고 天質이 夙成하신 위에 睿智가 날로 열녀 英明仁厚하신 器量이 世宗, 文宗에 내리지 안을 것 가티 되엿습니다. 왕의 一日長成은 首陽에 取하야 그만티 불리할 것은 물론임으로 韓明澮는 每樣 大事速行을 首陽께 慫慂하고 鄭麟趾의 무리가 內外로 周施하야 이에 端宗 3년 乙亥 閏 6월 11일로써 왕은 慶會樓에 御하야 叔父首陽大君을 불너 璽寶를 전하시고
나는 年幼多病하야 이 지위에 잇슬 수가 업스니 숙부께서 수고가 되시지만 왕위에 進하야 宗社主人이 되실 수 밧게 업소
이와가티 어린 인군은 물너나 上王이 되시고 首陽은 족하의 뒤를 니여 新王이 되엿습니다.이 일이 上王의 本意이든지 아니든지 그런 것은 논외로하고 하여튼지 표면과 형식으로는 정정당당한 禪讓일 뿐더러 그 자리에서 首陽은 어듸까지든지 叩首俯伏하야 固辭牢讓을 마지 아니하엿고 端宗이 도리혀 涕泣하시며 『叔父는 비록 忠純과 지성으로 固讓하시지만은 이것이 叔父 개인으로는 謙恭의 德이 될지 모르되 祖宗基業과 社稷生靈을 엇지 하랴고 그리시오.』 하시며 聲淚俱下하야 大寶를 移讓하섯고 首陽은 엇지하지 못하야 王命을 勉受한 것이니 暮夜密室에서 多年秘謀하든 簒位劇이 靑天白日下에 公演되든 때에는 이와가티 미화하야＜3＞사람의 이목이 가린 것이올시다. 그러나 明帝의 正式承認을 엇기 전에는 아무리 하야도 안전치 안키 때문에 翌 7월에 禮曹判書 金河와 刑曹判書 禹孝岡을 特使로 삼어 上王의 辭位表文을 가지고 北京에 보내니
『(前略) 先父恭順王薨逝之時 臣年十二 童稚承襲罔知攸爲 凡百庶務委諸臣僚 至景泰四年 奸臣謀逆 禍機斯迫 叔父陪臣首陽大君유 奔而告臣旋卽戡定 然而兇徒未殄變故相仍人心不安 以臣孱弱實難鎭定 社稷安危 所係甚重先臣母弟유 學通今古有功有德允孚輿望 己於年月日 令權襲句當軍國 伏望聖鑑洞察 特降明允』
이에 대하야 明의 景泰皇帝는
『恪守臣節益堅事大之誠 永固藩邦母忝嗣王之讓 其以(上王諱) 仍以其爵閑居 爾須常加優待 母敢或忽』
이라는 詔勅을 내리고 특히 上王께 優禮하야 怠慢이 업시하라고 申筋하얏습니다. 이로써 端宗은 壽康宮(現昌慶苑)에 물너나 養老가 안인 養幼를 하게되니 古今天下에 15세 太上王이 어듸 엇겟습니까 李朝에서도 高麗朝의 遺制를 取하야 例컨대 文宗의 後에 世祖(首陽)가스고 世祖의 뒤에 다른 王弟이나 端宗이 스게 되엿스면 어늬 때에든지 年長한 君王이 位에 잇서 政務를 廢함이 업고 또 허다한 왕궁의 비극이 업섯슬 것이외다. 王位를 싸돌고 골육간에 流血慘變이 稀少하든 點에서도 高麗朝의 史紀는 매우 明朗味가 잇습니다.

慶會樓上에서 端宗과 首陽의 叔侄분이 玉璽를 사이에다 노코 固援固辭로 相持할 때에 禮房承旨(現代의 內大臣府秘書長 兼 式部長官같은 것)로 入侍하얏든 集賢殿 學士 成三問이 이것을 보고 九曲肝腸을 寸斷하듯이 비통을 금치 못하얏습니다. 君側에 侍立하얏스매 소리를 내여 울지는 못하나 熱淚가 自然滂沱하야 袍袖를 적셧습니다. 首陽은 俯伏辭讓하면서도 頻頻히 머리를 드러 三問을 보고 脾晲하얏스나 그는 視若不見하고 자리를 떠나 欄頭에 이르러 蓮池를 瞰下하얏스나 意中에 장차 璽寶를 안꼬 池中에 投死하랴 한 것입니다.
그 親友 朴彭年이 눈치를 채이고 급히 뒤를 따라 가만히 挽止하고 位次에 다리고 와서 그날 儀式을 무사히 치럿스나 威公의 憤懣과 불평은 어지간치 안엇습니다.
『자네 무슨 이유로 나를 죽지 못하게 挽執하얏는가.』
『徒死無益하기 때문이지』
『事己至此에 죽지안코 무엇을 하나.』
『죽는 것은 어늬 때 죽어도 늣지 아니한 것일세. 그리고 上王이 位는 내버리섯지만은 春秋가 아즉 어리시니 압날이 극히 만흐신데 우리가 먼저 죽으면 그 어른을 엇지하잔 말인가.』
『그러면 자네는 復辟運動을 하잔 일인가.』
『아무렴 그러타뿐이겟나 아무리 말세의 인심이지만은 그래도 求해 보면 先王의 恩澤을 잇지 못하는 忠臣義士가 남어 잇슬 것이니 동지를 모하서 일을 꿈여보세 그리하야＜4＞성공하면 祖宗의 威靈과 上王의 洪福이오. 그럿치 못하면 一門百口의 목숨을 함께 밧처 先王의 知遇之恩에 보답할 뿐인즉 그럼으로 지금 죽지는 말나는 것일세.』
成公은 握手流涕하면서
『兄은 과연 내의 스승일세 그러면 죽을 것을 잠시 보류하고 대사를 도모하세.』
이와가티 復位密謀는 端宗의 퇴위 즉일에 2人의 청년 학사사이에 盟約이 성립되엿습니다.
元來 成三問은 都總管 成勝의 아들이오. 朴彭年은 刑曹判書 朴仲林의 아들인데 2公이 모다 名門貴家의 자제로 蛋年부터 文章學識이 一世에 뛰여나고 忠孝大節과 淸明雅望이 잇서 精金과 美玉으로써 稱譽되엿습니다. 그들이 겨우 弱冠을 면하야 先後하야 世宗朝에 登科하고 侍從의 職에 處하니 上이 그 才德을 사랑하야 信寵이 날로 더하섯습니다. 그 때 集賢殿 學士로 申叔舟, 河緯地, 崔恒, 李塏, 李石亨, 李承召, 徐居正, 柳誠源, 姜希顔, 成任, 朴元享 등의 一騎當千하는 才俊이 모혀 잇스나 成朴 2公과 申叔舟가 더욱 上의 愛重한 바가되여 항상 家人子侄과 가티 대우하섯스며 文宗이 東宮에 居하실새 日夜로 그들과 經史子集을 토론하시며 友人의 禮로 引接하야 謹甫, 仕叟라는 그들의 『字』를 부르섯습니다. 端宗의 元孫時代에 世宗은 親히 懷中에 안으시고 殿中에 산보하시면서 學士들을 보시고
『寡人이 百歲 후에 너희는 이 兒孩를 내 生時와 기티 愛護하여라』
鄭重懇側한 부탁이 내리시면 그들은 頓首涕泣하기를 마지아니 하얏스며 文宗께서는 말년의 어늬날 靡寧하신 중에도 그들을 臥內에 불너드려 야심토록 술(酒)를 주시며 娓娓히 酬酌하시고
『그대들을 대하야 談話하면 胸襟이 爽快하야 병을 이저바리노라』
하시며 그들이 취하야 일지 못하는 것을 보시면 宮人을 명하야 擔舁로 直所로 보내시고 御用의 衾褥를 주시며 茶湯을 豫備하야 醒後의 해갈을 식히섯습니다. 그들은 그 때마다 殊恩에 감격하야 서로 대하면 忠義로 勉勵하고 死로써 酬하기를 期하얏습니다. 그 때 朝臣이 누가 2大王의 恩寵에 感泣치 아니하리오만은 集賢諸學士에 니르러서는 特恩中에도 知己의 誼를 加蒙하얏습니다. 이제 그 때의 學士가 대부분은 首陽의 麾下에 馳參하얏지만은 成, 朴 諸公만이 獨히 端宗께 孤忠을 捧하야 烈丈夫의 松柏같은 지조를 직혓습니다.

當年叩馬敢言非
大義堂堂日月輝
草木亦霑周雨露
愧君猶食首陽薇

이 글이 成三問 선생이 北京에 出使하든 도중에서 *河에 잇는 伯夷叔齊의 祠廟를 지내다가 지은 7節 1首입니다. 上 2句는＜5＞ 그들이 周武王의 伐殷하랴고 行軍하야 가는 馬前에서 敢然히 신하로서 인군을 치는 것이 불가한 것을 力言하든 것을 讚美하야 凜然한 義氣가 日月과 爭光하는 것을 말하고 下 2句에는 夷齊가 武王이 듯지안는 것을 보고 飄然히 辭去하얏드니 뒤에 武王이 殷을 이기고 紂王은 自焚하야 죽어 천하의 판도가 周에 드러가니 그들이 周나라 땅에나는 곡식을 먹기도 不屑타 하야 이에 首陽山에 드러가 採薇生活로 告終한 것을 敍述하면서 周를 避하야 가는 이상에는 周王이 지배하는 版圖外로 갈 것이지 엇지 周의 雨露가 밋치는 首陽山에 갓섯드냐 그러면 그 領地되기는 一般인데 周의 粟를 耻食한다는 그대들로 엇지 周地의 薇는 먹엇느냐. 粟과 薇가 별로 다를 것이 업는 것을 强히 달니하랴 한 것을 나는 오히려 그대들을 위하야 愧恨하노라 責한 것입니다. 詩 그것은 넘우 이론에 지내처 忠厚한 정미가 乏少하지만은 夷齊라 하면 그 高節卓行이 千秋에 流芳하야 孟子는 聖의 淸한이라고 稱嘆하얏고 韓愈는 千萬古의 1人이라고까지 讚美한 사람인즉 이런 사람을 褒貶하는 것은 그보다 이상가는 節行이 업시는 不能할 것이 올시다. 그런데 이제 우리의 성선생은 夷齊로도 愧服할 풍절을 樹立하야 萬古 臣子의 龜鑑이 되엿스니 또한 偉大치 아니합니까 이 絶句一首로써 선생의 심사와 音容을 千載의 後에도 오히려 髣髴하게 想像할 수가 잇습니다. ＜6＞
