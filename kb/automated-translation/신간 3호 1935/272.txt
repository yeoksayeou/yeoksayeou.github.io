Literary Scene Comings and Goings

For a while, Sŏngbuk-tong was called the "Writers' Village," but recently, the area outside Ch'angŭimun Gate is becoming the Writers' Village. In Sŏngbuk-tong are Messrs. Kim Ŏk, Yi T'ae-jun, No Cha-yŏng, Kim Ki-jin, etc., and outside Ch'angŭimun Gate are Messrs. Yi Kwang-su, Hyŏn Chin-gŏn, Ŏm Hŭng-sŏp, Song Yŏng, etc. So to speak, there's the Eastern Writers' Village and the Western Writers' Village. In the old days, it might have been worth having a "factional fight" (편쌈), but since the figures involved are literary men, martial spirit is strictly forbidden, though a competition of literary skill might be worth trying sometime. It's regrettable that the Western Writers' Village lacks a poet, and it's lonely that the Eastern Writers' Village has only one poet.

Speaking of things outside the gate, not only has the area outside Ch'angŭimun Gate been famous as Chosŏn's fruit tree region since old times, but its landscape is bright and clear, and especially, the drinking water is good, so it is said that there is no disease and digestion is good—that is its characteristic. However, recently Mr. Ŏm Hŭng-sŏp has been suffering from indigestion, his face is unbelievably thin, and on top of that, he's suffering from a stye in his eye. It seems even the miraculous spring water is ineffective. From what I gather, it appears this illness arose because he's been writing too many manuscripts lately.

Poet Pak P'al-yang and novelist Yi T'ae-jun are both department heads at the Chosŏn Chungang Ilbosa newspaper—one is the Social Affairs Department head, the other the Arts and Culture Department head. Recently, there have been absolutely no works published by them, making one curious. According to inquiries, the company's regulations strictly prohibit its employees from writing for other publications. Therefore, when these two are requested for manuscripts from other magazines, they reportedly refuse them all. While this might be good for the company, it's a problematic issue for the literary world.＜100＞

A certain newspaper company recruited prize-winning novels for last year's New Year's issue, selected first and second prize winners for full-length novels respectively, and even announced them with great fanfare. However, for a certain Mr. [X] who won second prize, even today, a year later, they haven't sent the prize money, nor even a postcard, and they also haven't published the work. The author became so anxious that his patience ran out. Around last December, he came up to Seoul, visited the person in charge at the company, and explained the situation. The person in charge showed no sign of apology and reportedly refused, saying they could neither give the prize money nor publish the work. The reason given was that there had been changes within the company during that time, the person in charge had also changed, and consequently, the content of the work had become difficult to publish. However, the president is the same person, and the company is the same company. If they avoid fulfilling the company's responsibility to society just because some reporters changed, is that permissible? This too is a major disgraceful incident in the literary world.

Recently, it seems Mr. Chŏng Chi-yong is not writing poetry. Since he recited "Straits, Two in the Afternoon" (海峽午后二時) hosted by the Group of Nine (九人會) last year, there has been no news at all. When someone curiously asked, he replied, "Isn't it that poetry isn't something you write anytime, but only when inspiration strikes?" Before the chalk dust starts looking like white snow every day, life is dry and tasteless, so his lamentation about lacking inspiration also has a point.

Muae, Mr. Yang Chu-dong, who for a while waged debates, must be busy with school affairs, and in recent years, his face cannot be seen. Also, why is it that we cannot see any poetry from him after "The Pulse of Chosŏn" (朝鮮의 脈博)? Given the already weak state [of the literary scene], it is true that the literary world's loneliness will grow as people retire one by one like this. Is there no preparation for a comeback in the New Year?

**Summary**

This article from 1935 provides gossip and commentary on the Korean literary scene ("mundan"). It notes the geographical clustering of writers into "Writers' Villages" in Sŏngbuk-tong and outside Ch'angŭimun Gate, listing prominent figures in each. It shares anecdotes about writers' health (Ŏm Hŭng-sŏp's illness from overwork), professional constraints (Chosŏn Chungang Ilbo preventing its writers Pak P'al-yang and Yi T'ae-jun from publishing elsewhere), frustrations (a newspaper failing to award prize money or publish a winning novel), and inactivity (Chŏng Chi-yong and Yang Chu-dong not producing new work), expressing concern over the "poverty" and "loneliness" of the literary field. Historically, the article offers insights into the social geography of intellectuals in colonial Seoul, the economic pressures and institutional controls faced by writers (newspaper policies, prize scandals), and a contemporary sense of anxiety about the vitality and future of Korean literature during this period. The casual mention of writers' health and creative blocks alongside institutional problems paints a picture of the precariousness of literary life.

文壇往來
한동안 城北洞이 文士村이라고 하드니 近間에는 彰義門外가 文士村이 되어간다. 城北洞에는 金億, 李泰俊, 盧子泳, 金基鎭氏等이고 彰義門外에는 李光洙, 玄鎭健, 嚴興燮, 宋影氏等이다. 말하자면, 東部의 文士村, 西部의 文士村 옛날같으면 『편쌈』이라도 한번해볼만한 일이지만 人物이 文士들이라 武氣는 大禁物이나 文筆競爭은 한번쯤 해볼만한일이다 西部文士村에는 詩人이 없는 것이 遺憾이고 東部文士村에는 詩人이 꼭한사람만이 잇는 것이 孤獨하다.
×
門박이야기가 낫으니 말이지 彰義門外는 옛날붙어 朝鮮果樹地로 有名한것뿐만아니라 山水가 明朗하고 더욱이 飮料水가 좋아서 疾病이 없고 消火가 잘된다는 것이, 그곳의 特色이드니 近日嚴興燮氏 消化不良으로 끌걱거리고 단이며, 얼굴이 말너서 말이 아닌데다가, 눈대래끼끼지나가지고 애를쓰니 靈泉藥水도 無效한 것이다. 알고보면 近日 原稿를 너무 쓰느라고 그런 病이 난모양이란다.
×
詩人 朴八陽氏 小說家 李泰俊氏는 두분다 朝鮮中央日報社 社會部長, 한분은 學藝部長인데, 近來 도모지 作品發表가 없어서 굼금하드니 探聞한바에 依하면 社의 規正이 自己社의사람으로 다른 出版物에 執筆을 嚴禁한다고-. 그래서 이두분은 다른 雜誌에서 原稿를 請하면 一切로 謝絶한다고한다. 社를 위해서는 좋은일인지는 모르나 文藝界를 위해서는 問題꺼리다.＜100＞

某新聞社에서는 昨年新年號에 懸賞小說를 募集해서 長篇小說를 一等, 二等, 제 各各選하야 大書特筆하야 發表까지 해놓고 二等當選된 某氏에게는 一年에지낸 今日까지 賞金도 아니보내고 葉書한장도 없엇으며 또한 作品發表도 하지않어서 作者된이는 하도 굼금해서 忍術도 有限하야 요전 十二月頃 上京하야 社의 責任者를 訪問하고 그 事情를 말하니 責任者는 조금도 未安한 氣色이없어 亦是賞金도 줄 수 없고 發表도할수없다고 拒絶를하드라고-그 理由인즉 그 間社內가 變動되여서 責任者도 갈리엿으며 따러서 作品內容이 發表하기 어렵게되엿음을 할하드라고- 그러나 社長이 同一한사람이고 社가 同一한 社인데 記者가 좀 變動되엇다고 社의 社會에 對한 責任을 履行치안코 그대로 속여너머가티면 可能할것인가? 이것도 文壇의 一大不祥事.
×
近間 鄭芝鎔氏는 詩作을하지않는모양이다. 昨年에 九人會主催로 『海峽午后二時』를 朗讀한 것을 最後로 아모 消息이 없다. 누가 굼금해서 무르니 『詩란 아모때나 쓰는 것이 아니라 感興이 잇어야 쓰는것이니깐 그렇지 않으냐고』날마다 분필가루가 白雪로 보이기 前에야 乾燥無味한 生活이니 感興없어서 詠歎함도 亦有一理
×
한동안 論陣을 펴든 無涯 梁柱東氏는 校務도 奔忙하려니와 近年에는 그의 얼굴을 볼 수 없다. 또한 『朝鮮의 脈博』以後詩作도 볼수없음은 어찌함인고-. 갓득인나 貧弱한데 이렇게 한사람 두사람 文壇에서 隱退하니 文壇의 孤寂함이커갈 것도 事實이나 新年에는 捲土重來할 準備가 없는가?
