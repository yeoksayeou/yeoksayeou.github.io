New Tactics of the Chinese Women's Movement: Organization of the No-Marriage League / Focusing on Absolute Equality Between Men and Women

Recently, China's dictator, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek (蔣介石), has attracted attention by issuing various new laws and ordinances. Among them, he issued an ordinance concerning male-female relations, specifically stating that a married woman who has relations with an outside man will be sentenced to up to three years of imprisonment with hard labor. Chinese women, who for some time had been rising up calling for gender equality, were dumbfounded by this news. Devising countermeasures against this, they sought significant support from the wives of high officials and went to the Legislative Department (立法部) to seek understanding (兩解), but were ultimately rejected. Therefore, this time, they intend to resist by organizing a "No-Marriage League" (不嫁同盟), absolutely refusing to marry men. The president of this association is said to be Ms. Wang Sŏjuk (王瑞竹). The association's principles are:

One, members who join this league pledge not to marry.
One, members who join this league aim for economic independence through a spirit of independent self-reliance.
One, members who join this league shall strive towards the goal of women's social, political, legal, and economic equality. <107>

**Summary**

This article reports on the formation of the "No-Marriage League" (不嫁同盟) by women in China in response to a new law enacted by Chiang Kai-shek. The law specifically penalized married women for adultery with up to three years imprisonment, which Chinese feminists saw as deeply unequal. Led by Wang Sŏjuk, the league advocated for women to refuse marriage and strive for economic independence and absolute gender equality in all spheres (social, political, legal, economic). From the perspective of Korean colonial history, this article is interesting as it shows Korean awareness of and reporting on feminist movements and political developments in neighboring China. It reflects an interest in international discourses on gender equality and resistance against patriarchal laws, potentially serving as a point of reference or comparison for Koreans grappling with similar issues under Japanese colonial rule.

최근에 중국의 독재자인 장개석씨(蔣介石)는 여러 가지의 새로로운 법령을 내서주의를 끌드니, 그중에도 남녀관게에 관한 법령을 내엿으니 즉 남편잇는 여자가 외간남자와 관게가 잇는때에는 三년이하의 중역을 식힌다는것인데, 한동안 남녀평등을 부르짓고 이러나든 중국여성들은 이소리에 기가막히여서 이에대한 대책을 강구하야 일방으로 대관부인들의 다대한 후원을 어더가지고 립업부에가서 량해를 구하엿으나 그여코 거절을당하고 말엇다. 그래서 이번에는 남자들에게는 절대로시집을 아니가겟다는 불가동맹을 조직하야서 대항코 자한다고하는데 그회의 회장은 왕서죽(王瑞竹)양이라 한다. 그회측은
