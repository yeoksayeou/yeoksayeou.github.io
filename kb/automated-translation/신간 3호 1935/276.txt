Cultivated Land Area of Korea

As of the end of Showa 8 (1933), the cultivated land area of Korea is 4,489,200 *chŏngbo*. Of this, 1,681,800 *chŏngbo* are paddy fields (畓) (35.5% of the total area), and 2,807,400 *chŏngbo* are dry fields (田) (62.5%). Looking at the composition of paddy and dry fields by province, regions where paddy fields are relatively abundant compared to dry fields are Chŏlla North (全北), Ch'ungch'ŏng South (忠南), and Kyŏngsang South (慶南) (in that order). In Kyŏnggi (京畿), Ch'ungch'ŏng North (忠北), Chŏlla South (全南), and Kyŏngsang North (慶北), paddy and dry fields are roughly equal. In Hamgyŏng North (咸北), Hamgyŏng South (咸南), P'yŏngan South (平南), P'yŏngan North (平北), Hwanghae (黃海), and Kangwŏn (江原), over 70% of the cultivated land is dry fields; among these, in Hamgyŏng North, 92.2% of the cultivated land is dry fields.

Also, looking at cultivated land by province, Hwanghae (黃海) has the most with 554,000 *chŏngbo*. The provinces of Chŏlla South (全南), Hamgyŏng South (咸南), P'yŏngan North (平北), P'yŏngan South (平南), Kyŏnggi (京畿), and Kyŏngsang North (慶北) are in the 400,000 *chŏngbo* range and belong to the regions with abundant cultivated land. Kangwŏn (江原) has over 300,000 *chŏngbo*. Kyŏngsang South (慶南), Ch'ungch'ŏng South (忠南), Chŏlla North (全北), and Hamgyŏng North (咸北) are in the 200,000 *chŏngbo* range. The smallest is Ch'ungch'ŏng North (忠北) with 160,000 *chŏngbo*. The ratio of cultivated land area to the total area of all Korea (全朝鮮) is 22% (二割二厘). Looking at this provincial ratio, Hwanghae's 32.8% (三割二分八厘) is the highest. Kyŏnggi, Ch'ungch'ŏng South, and Chŏlla South are in the 30% range (三割臺). Chŏlla North, P'yŏngan South, Kyŏngsang South, Ch'ungch'ŏng North, and Kyŏngsang North are in the 20% range (二割臺). P'yŏngan North, Kangwŏn, Hamgyŏng South, and Hamgyŏng North are in the 10% range (一割臺).

Furthermore, within the total cultivated land area, owner-cultivated land (自作地) is 1,962,000 *chŏngbo* (43.7% of the total cultivated area), and tenant-farmed land (小作地) is 2,527,000 *chŏngbo* (56.3%). Looking at this by paddy and dry fields:
1. Within the 1,682,000 *chŏngbo* of paddy fields (畓), owner-cultivated land is 32.5%, and tenant-farmed land is 67.5%. The only places where owner-cultivated land is more common than tenant land are the two provinces of Hamgyŏng North (咸北) and Hamgyŏng South (咸南). In all other provinces, tenant land is more common. Especially in the provinces of Chŏlla North (全北), Kyŏnggi (京畿), Ch'ungch'ŏng South (忠南), and Hwanghae (黃海), over 70% of the paddy fields are tenant-farmed.
2. Within the 2,808,000 *chŏngbo* of dry fields (田), owner-cultivated land is 50.4%, and tenant-farmed land is 49.6%. Provinces where owner-cultivated land is more common than tenant land are the four provinces of Hamgyŏng North (咸北), Hamgyŏng South (咸南), Chŏlla South (全南), and Kangwŏn (江原). In all other provinces, tenant land is more common. Among these, in the provinces of Kyŏnggi (京畿), Ch'ungch'ŏng North (忠北), Ch'ungch'ŏng South (忠南), and Chŏlla North (全北), over 60% [of dry fields] are tenant-farmed.

Number of Korean Agricultural Households

Currently, the number of farm households in Korea (朝鮮) is 2,998,498 Korean households; combining with others totals 3,009,855 households. Among these, the number of full-time farming households (專業戶數) is 2,843,996 (94.5% of total households), and part-time farming households (兼業戶) number 165,859 (5.5%).

By province, Chŏlla South (全南) has the most households at 380,000. Kyŏngsang North (慶北) has 360,000, Kyŏngsang South (慶南) has 290,000, and Kangwŏn (江原), Hwanghae (黃海), and Kyŏnggi (京畿) each have 240,000, following next. Chŏlla North (全北), Ch'ungch'ŏng South (忠南), Hamgyŏng South (咸南), and P'yŏngan South (平南) each have around 200,000 households. Ch'ungch'ŏng North (忠北) has 140,000 households, and Hamgyŏng North (咸北) has 80,000, the fewest in the country.

Also, looking by farming category (營農의 移別): Tenant farmers (小作農) number 1,560,000 households (51.9% of total farm households). Owner-farmers also doing tenant farming (自作兼小作農) number 720,000 households (24.2%). Owner-farmers (自作農) number 550,000 households (18.1%). Households of agricultural laborers (被備者戶數) number 90,000 households (3.1%). Fire-field farmer (火田民) households number 80,000 households (2.7%).

The ratio of farm households to total households is 76.2%. Looking at this by province, Kangwŏn's (江原) 89.7% is the highest rate. Ch'ungch'ŏng North (忠北), Chŏlla North (全北), Chŏlla South (全南), Hwanghae (黃海), and Kyŏngsang North (慶北) are in the 80% range. P'yŏngan North (平北), Hamgyŏng South (咸南), Kyŏngsang South (慶南), and P'yŏngan South (平南) are in the 70% range. Hamgyŏng North (咸北) is in the 60% range. Kyŏnggi's (京畿) 56.5% is the lowest rate.

**Summary**

This article presents agricultural statistics for Korea as of the end of 1933. It details the total cultivated land area, broken down into paddy (rice) fields and dry fields, showing significant regional variations. It quantifies land tenure, revealing that tenant farming (56.3%) was more common than owner-cultivation (43.7%), with tenancy rates particularly high for paddy fields (67.5%) and in specific provinces like Chŏlla North, Kyŏnggi, Ch'ungch'ŏng South, and Hwanghae. The article also provides data on farm households, indicating that over 3 million households engaged in farming (constituting 76.2% of all households), with the vast majority (94.5%) being full-time farmers. Over half of these farm households were purely tenant farmers (51.9%). This data is significant for historians studying Korea under Japanese rule, illustrating the structure of the colonial agricultural economy, the prevalence of tenancy (a major source of social and economic tension), regional disparities in land use and tenure, and the overwhelming agrarian nature of Korean society at the time. The high rate of tenancy, especially in rice-producing regions, reflects key aspects of colonial land policies and economic exploitation.
