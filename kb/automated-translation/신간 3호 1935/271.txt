Casual Talk on Newspapers

Right after the March First Movement (己未), the Tonga Ilbo (東亞), Chosŏn Ilbo (朝鮮), and Sisa Sinmun (時事) were permitted. The Tonga was recognized not only by itself but also by the general populace as the representative newspaper of the people. At the same time, its editorial tone and the attitude with which it handled general articles were quite upright and stern (剛直■厲), often resulting in confiscation and suspension orders. The Chosŏn Ilbo initially positioned itself as a business newspaper, serving as the organ of the Taishō Shinbokkai (大正親睦會). However, in an effort to cater to the public sentiment of the time and compete with the Tonga Ilbo for sales, it adopted an editorial tone and handled articles contrary to its original purpose, also frequently facing confiscation and suspension orders. The Sisa Sinmun, being the organ of Min Wŏn-sik's (閔元植) faction, the Kungmin Hyŏphoe (國民協會), was faithful in propagating its principles, but it was unpopular with the general public at the time and thus not widely read.

Consequently, on a certain occasion, a certain official summoned individuals related to each newspaper and, in a manner combining instruction and reprimand, said, "The Tonga Ilbo has become an anti-Japanese newspaper, the Chosŏn Ilbo a crazy newspaper (氣違イ新聞), and the Sisa Sinmun an unread newspaper (見ナイ新聞), so isn't it true that there isn't a single real newspaper in Korea (朝鮮)?" This became a topic of conversation in newspaper circles for a time.

However, now, due to the passage of time, the newspapers no longer face such criticisms, but because regional fervor is quite strong, there is the assessment that the Tonga is the newspaper for Chŏlla Province people, the Chosŏn for P'yŏngan Province people, and the Chungang [Sinmun] for Kiho region people. If that's the case, it seems people from Hamgyŏng, Hwanghae, Kyŏngsang, and Kangwŏn provinces still lack their own newspaper, and perhaps there is no common newspaper for the entire Korean populace. In the New Year, couldn't some benevolent "Gold Mine King" (金鑛大王) emerge, transcending regional fervor, to give birth to a complete newspaper for the Korean people?

But let's set aside idle talk... As in previous years, various companies are competitively soliciting literary works for prizes. Among them, a certain company is offering a prize of twenty won (一金二十圓也) for a true story (實話) titled "Hardship Ends, Sweetness Comes" (苦盡甘來記). The theme is cliché, but it seems to have a slightly more promising outlook than "Joy Ends, Sorrow Comes" (興盡悲來記), and it's quite equivalent to the Spring Greeting phrase "Misfortune Goes, Fortune Comes" (否往泰來).

The Chosŏn Ilbo recently underwent some internal changes [lit. 'a portion of the cabinet changed']. The announcement date coincidentally fell on December 4th, the full 50th anniversary of the coup d'état initiated by Kim Ok-kyun (金玉均) and his faction of the Enlightenment Party (開化黨). The Editor-in-Chief Sŏ Ch'un (徐椿), Managing Editor Kim Hyŏng-wŏn (金炯元), and Arts & Culture Editor Hong Ki-mun (洪起文) also coincidentally share the same surnames as Kim Ok-kyun (金玉均), Sŏ Kwang-bŏm (徐光範), and Hong Yŏng-sik (洪英植) from the Kapsin (甲申) era. However, we hope the Chosŏn Ilbo's 'cabinet' does not suffer a three-day reign like Kim Ok-kyun's cabinet, but becomes a cabinet for ten thousand years.
×
Speaking of the Kapsin Coup (甲申政變), both the Chosŏn Ilbo and Chungang Sinmun covered the event extensively on December 4th, but the Tonga Ilbo alone maintained silence. It is unknown whether the editors temporarily forgot or if there was another reason.

Since newspapers are both reporting organs and propaganda organs, individuals or groups planning any initiative find it necessary to gain their support. Newspapers, too, should review the content of such initiatives and, if support is deemed necessary, provide convenience as much as possible. However, looking at the recent attitude of various newspapers, when asked for support in hosting meetings related to schools or other public works, they are somehow unwilling to grant it. Yet, when commercial entities like record companies request promotional support, they respond positively to every request, offering extensive promotion and support through articles and photographs. What could be the reason for this?

Furthermore, for advertisements from Ōsaka or Tōkyō, they accept lower rates and allow for deferred payment. However, for advertisements from Koreans, they often charge higher rates and usually demand cash payment upfront. What is the reason for this? While lamenting the sluggishness of Korean commerce and industry in their pages and advocating for the need for encouragement, they act so harshly and unfairly towards actual Korean merchants and industrialists regarding advertising. Isn't this too contradictory? Each company should... (Continued on page 99) <101>
-(Continued on page 101)-
...compete to handle advertisements from Tōkyō or Ōsaka, boasting about the volume of advertising revenue as proof of their newspaper's credibility and authority. But do they know how much money flows out of Korean pockets because of those advertisements, and at the same time, how greatly the Korean commercial and industrial world is affected? <99>

**Summary**

This 1935 article critiques the major Korean newspapers of the time (Tonga Ilbo, Chosŏn Ilbo, Sisa Sinmun, Chungang Sinmun). It notes their historical suppression under Japanese rule, contemporary perceptions of regional bias (Tonga/Chŏlla, Chosŏn/P'yŏngan, Chungang/Kiho), and the lack of a truly pan-Korean newspaper. The author contrasts the papers' reluctance to support public or educational initiatives with their eagerness to promote commercial ventures, especially Japanese ones. A key criticism is the discriminatory advertising practices: offering favorable terms (lower rates, credit) to Japanese advertisers from Ōsaka and Tōkyō while charging higher rates and demanding cash upfront from Korean businesses, contradicting their own editorials supporting Korean industry.

From a historical perspective, the article is revealing about the complex media landscape in colonial Korea. It highlights: 1) The persistent issue of regionalism within Korean society, reflected in newspaper readership and perceived affiliations. 2) The economic pressures and discriminatory practices faced by Koreans, extending even into the advertising policies of Korean-run newspapers, likely influenced by the colonial power structure and the economic dominance of Japanese capital. 3) The internal contradictions within the Korean press, caught between nationalist sentiment (supporting Korean industry in editorials) and pragmatic business decisions potentially favouring Japanese advertisers. Historians might find the specific anecdote about the official's criticism and the detailed comparison of advertising practices particularly illustrative of the socio-economic realities and power dynamics of the period.
