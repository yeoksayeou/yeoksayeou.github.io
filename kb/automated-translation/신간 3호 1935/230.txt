Kaebyŏk Company "Mark" Production and Sale
						Kaebyŏk Company Sales Bureau

Especially to Branch Office Members and Company Associates!

We have now produced the company "mark" (logo pin), which had long been planned but not realized, and have decided to offer it at cost. The design was selected from over 500 entries gathered over several months through a large prize contest advertised previously in our company's publication, *Pyŏlgŏn'gon* magazine (別乾坤誌上), and is the one that best expresses the company's intention (社意). As you can see, you might not immediately grasp the symbolism of the design, but simply explained, the circle (圓) represents the universe, and the diagonal line (斜線) represents a writing brush (筆棒), symbolizing piercing the universe with the brush (붓). It is tri-colored—the price (甲) is 30 *chŏn*, including postage (送料). We will dispatch them as soon as payment (送金) is received (次第).<73>

**Summary**

This article is an announcement from the Kaebyŏk Company's Sales Bureau regarding the production and sale of company logo pins ("marks"). It details that the logo design was chosen through a contest advertised in their other magazine, *Pyŏlgŏn'gon*, and explains the symbolism: a brush piercing the universe. The pins are offered at cost (30 *chŏn* including postage) primarily to branch members and associates. From a historical perspective, this piece offers insight into the marketing and branding efforts of a significant Korean publishing house during the colonial period. The intellectual symbolism of the logo (piercing the universe with a brush) reflects the company's likely self-perception and aspirations amidst the constraints of the era, making it interesting for historians studying cultural production and identity formation.
