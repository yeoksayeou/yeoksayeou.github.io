乙亥와 朝鮮
						江郊散人

Responding to the request of Kaebyŏk magazine, I have undertaken the narration of Korea's history of factional strife (黨爭史), already completing two installments. It is a source of personal shame and regret that many points remain unclear due to my crude and clumsy writing (蕪拙). However, what I have described so far is this: although it is true that Korea's factional calamity (黨禍) reached its peak of ferocity during the Yi Dynasty, if we trace its origins (源委), we find that already during the reign of King Kwangjong of Koryŏ, the grand ambitions (洪圖宏謨) from the time of King T'aejo's founding were lost. Through the naturalized Ssang Ki (雙冀), the civil service examination system (科試制度) was initiated, employing exclusively literary skill in poetry and prose to recruit talent. This opened the path for official rank via exams (功令科宦) to become the object of contention among scholars (士子). After King Kojong, following the establishment of special friendly relations (誼好) with the imperial house of the Yuan Dynasty, Song Neo-Confucianism (宋儒의 理學) flowed in abundantly (滔滔하게). Furthermore, the backlash against the lingering evils (餘弊) of excessive reverence for Buddhism (崇佛) spurred this on. The title of "Authentic Confucian Supervisor of the Way" (道監眞儒) – in reality, a foolish affair (痴事) born from the habits of pedantic Confucianism (儒迂) – which Han Yu of Tang and Zhu Xi (朱熹) of Song, separated by 300 years, painstakingly sought to claim, further encouraged and perfected this trend. Thus, scholars who aimed for "study in youth, action in maturity" (幼學壯行) with the ideal of "serving the king and benefiting the people, cultivating self and bringing peace" (致君澤民, 修齋治平), ended up competing for fame outside the court (野) and profit within the court (朝), losing their true scholarly nature and becoming mere profit-seeking merchants (多利의 商賈). Once they became merchants, in their eyes (安中) there was only victory and defeat. Since life and death diverged based on victory or defeat, it was an unavoidable consequence that their struggles would involve sinister stratagems (陰險환 術畧), vicious methods (惡辣한 수단), and base alliances and betrayals (醜卑한 離合). Therefore, it is no wonder that the strife during the Yi Dynasty was so extreme, as I have briefly discussed. Consequently, the incident at the very beginning (劈頭) of the Yi Dynasty's founding, involving Prince Chŏngan versus Crown Prince Pang-sŏk (靖安君 對 芳碩世子), was merely the prologue to a play (戱曲) performed on the new stage of Hanyang by the shameless actors of fame and profit who had overthrown (覆亡) the Wang clan. Following this, the Chŏngnan Incident (靖難事件) during the Kyeyu year of King Tanjong's reign was nothing more than Koreans, who considered themselves "Little China" (小中華), imitating and performing (模倣演奏) a script written by Emperor Yongle of the Ming Dynasty. In essence, though the time and place differed, it was not our creation at all; it was still the old drama of Li Shimin (李世民) and Zhu Di (朱棣) performed in a Korean style by Korean actors (朝鮮俳優). Because the stage was small and the figures lowly (低小), it merely had the appearance of a farce (촌극). However, the single consistent guiding spirit was the struggle for fame and profit (名利鬪爭). In the Pyŏngja year of King Sejo's reign, when the secret plot for the restoration of the deposed king (上王復位) was exposed (綻露), its leader, Sŏng Sam-mun (成三問), while receiving cruel punishment (酷刑) from Sejo <7> and being led to the execution ground with his comrades, looked back at the triumphant high officials of the opposing faction (名利派의 政敵大官) and cried out:
"You serve the wise king, create an era of great peace, and receive boundless blessings and profit! Sam-mun will only take his single-minded loyalty and respectfully offer it to the two former kings, Sejong and Munjong."
What sternly passionate (凜烈慷慨) words, like gold and iron (金鐵), from a true scholar and true man, transcendent above fame and profit! Therefore, I always say that throughout the 500-year history of the Yi Dynasty, if not for Sŏng Sam-mun and the other Six Ministers (六臣), the rest would be mere power-hungry ghosts (權鬼) and parasitic officials (祿虫); if not for Yulgok (栗谷), only decadent scholars (腐儒) and bookworms (書*); if not for Ch'oe Che-u (崔濟愚) and Chŏn Pong-jun (全琫準), there would be no righteous people (義民) to speak out (吐氣) for the populace. And if King Sejong the Great (世宗大王) had not existed, and Admiral Yi Sun-sin (李忠武公) had not existed, then even with the presence of these two or three aforementioned figures, the *Tongguk T'onggam* (東國通鑑) would be covered entirely in a gloomy, cold, dead atmosphere (陰冷한 死氣), rendering it unworthy of a single read – this I dare assert.

The event following the Kyeyu Chŏngnan mentioned in the previous installment was the Ŭrhae Abdication (乙亥禪位). This Ŭrhae year was 480 years ago from now, meaning this year, Ŭrhae, corresponds to its 8th sexagenary cycle (週 干支). Incidentally, the T'aesae (太歲) of the Ŭrhae cyclical sign and the history of Yi Dynasty factional strife share a miraculously inseparable and crucial connection. Firstly, T'aejo (太祖), the founder of the Yi Dynasty, was born in the Ŭrhae year, the 4th year after King Ch'ungsuk of Koryŏ, letting out his first cry of life that would build a 500-year dynasty in Yŏnghŭng. In the Ŭrhae year marking the first 60-year cycle (一週甲), the decision to establish the capital in Hanyang (漢陽 尊都) had been made the previous Kapsul year, and while the great work of establishing the authority of the new court was underway (*掌되는), the new Crown Prince Pang-sŏk (芳碩新世子) was invested (冊封), dividing the court officials into two factions locked in conflict (軋轢). The Ŭrhae of the second cycle (2週甲) saw the abdication (禪讓) of King Tanjong, leading to the secret plan of the Six Ministers (六臣), which germinated (胚胎) the Purge of Scholars (士禍) in the following Pyŏngja year and the tragedies at Yŏngwŏl and Sunhŭng the year after that. In the Ŭrhae of the third cycle (3週甲), following the birth of King Injong (仁宗) and the death of Queen Changgyŏng (章敬王后), a group of young Confucian scholars (儒士) led by Kim Ch'ungam (金沖庵) and Cho Chŏngam (趙靜庵) proposed the restoration of Queen Sin (愼妃), who had been unjustly deposed by the meritorious subjects of the restoration (靖國勳臣). This not only became a major issue of right and wrong (是非問題) in Korea but also served as the trigger, creating an unbridgeable gulf (溝渠) between the old guard (勳舊) and the "clear stream" faction (淸流). This eventually led to the Kimyo Purge (己卯 北門의 禍) and the later struggle between the Greater Yun and Lesser Yun factions, resulting in the heaven-overwhelming treason cases (滔天大獄) of Ŭlsa, Chŏngmi, and Kiyu. The lingering waves of Yun Wŏn-hyŏng's (尹元衡) wielding power and rejoicing in calamity (貧權樂禍 - likely 弄權樂禍) laid the foundation for the cause of the East-West party division (東西黨論) in the fourth Ŭrhae cycle (4週 乙亥), the 8th year of King Sŏnjo (宣祖大王), establishing clear factional labels (色目) and planting the seed of disaster (禍機) for 300 years of bloody struggle thereafter. In the fifth Ŭrhae cycle (第 5週 乙亥), facing the rise of the Qing Dynasty (淸朝新興), the issue of serving and maintaining peaceful relations (服事和好問題) caused the pro-peace and rejectionist factions to rise up vehemently. Surrounding (包圍) the arguments of Ch'oe Myŏng-gil (崔鳴吉), Kim Si-yang (金時讓), Chŏng Ch'ung-sin (鄭忠信), and others for renewing the alliance to delay disaster (續盟緩禍說), renowned scholars of the passionately agitated (慷慨激昻) "Spring and Autumn Annals righteousness" faction (春秋義理派), led by the veteran statesman Kim Ryu (金瑬), forcefully advocated the theory of "Revering Zhou and Expelling Barbarians" (尊周攘夷論) either verbally or in writing, making enough noise to embarrass the officials (廷臣) and scholars of the Ming court. This ultimately invited the great disaster of the Pyŏngja year (丙子大難), and even after emerging (出揚) with the humiliation of Namhan Fortress in the Chŏngchuk year (丁丑 南漢의 羞辱), with the succession of King Hyojong (孝宗嗣位) and the establishment of the Northern Expedition plan (北伐計劃), wise scholars were widely sought. Reclusive Confucian scholars from the mountains and forests (山林隱逸의 儒士) received summons filling the court (旌招滿朝). Before discussing military arts and training soldiers (講武練兵), they ended up fighting over Neo-Confucianism and ritual theory (理學과 禮論). Even then, there was no creativity or original thought; they merely picked up the dregs (糟粕) of people from other countries like Han, Tang, and Song, taking sides (曰是曰非) and shielding or criticizing (庇議) each other. To pedantic scholars (腐儒), this might have been a supreme great enterprise (無上大事業), <8> but the state's plans and the people's lives were neglected amidst trivial debates (辯髦), and factional strife intensified (黨禍를 激成), leading to repeated tragic dramas where grudges were repaid through slaughter (殺戮). Sixty years later, in the sixth Ŭrhae cycle (6週 乙亥), the 21st year of King Sukchong (肅宗), following the restoration of Queen Min (閔后) in the previous Kapsul year, the issue of Chang Hŭi-jae's (張希載) punishment further intensified the friction and discord between the existing South (南) and West (西) factions, adding the new conflict between the Old (老) and Young (少) Doctrines, creating the source of calamity (禍原) for the Sinim year purges during King Kyŏngjong's (景宗) reign. Another sixty years later, the seventh Ŭrhae cycle (7週 乙亥), the 31st year of King Yŏngjo (英祖), saw King Yŏngjo, chastened by factional strife (黨禍), attempt to harmonize both sides using the Policy of Impartiality (蕩平策). However, the various factions (各派 黨人), harboring blood enmity and bone-deep grudges (血怨骨讐) both publicly and privately, could absolutely not be reconciled (融解). Then, in this year, the treason case of Sin Ch'i-un (申致雲) occurred. The Soron faction (少論), fearing retaliation from the Noron faction (老論), collectively submitted self-recriminating memorials (自訟䟽), discarding their assertions since the Sinim period. Simultaneously, the Noron created the *Ch'anŭi Sogam* (闡義昭鑑), establishing it as the national policy (國是) set in stone and raising a victory cry (勝鬨). King Yŏngjo rejoiced that "In this corner of the Eastern Sea, Heaven and Earth are bright again" (一隅海東, 乾坤重明), but there was no way factional strife could be resolved by this. The pent-up and brewing (鬱結醞釀) toxic germs, through the hands of scheming villains (狐鼠輩) leaping about (跳梁) in the palace precincts (宮圍), caused the Imo Incident (壬午大變). King Chŏngjo (正祖), the legitimate descendant (正嫡血胤) of Crown Prince Sado (思悼世子), still had to publish the *Myŏngŭirok* (明義錄) while being unable to avoid guaranteeing the safety of the prime culprit's (元兇) leader (首領), Kim Kwi-ju (金龜柱). Thus, in the eighth Ŭrhae cycle (8週 乙亥), the 15th year of King Sunjo (純祖), Lady Hyegyŏng (惠慶宮 - King Chŏngjo's mother), concluding (絡了) a life condensed with blood and tears, buried the factional strife (時辟) of the times in darkness (闇). Even before that, with the compromise between Kim Cho-sun (金祖淳) and Yi Sang-hwang (李相璜), factional struggle ostensibly ceased on the surface. Political influence by consort families (戚里의 世道) proceeded to manage internal and external government affairs. Then, from the Kapcha year of King Kojong's (高宗) reign, the Hŭngsŏn Taewŏn'gun (興宣大院君) took turns with the consort families, grasping the reins of government (政柄) and implementing his favored isolationist policy (鎖國政策). Meanwhile, due to the clever machinations of Queen Myŏngsŏng (明成后) internally and pressure from Li Hung-chang (李鴻章) externally, he left his position of "Regent" (輔政) and spent gloomy (悶悶) years in Chik-tong, Yangju. During this time, the ninth Ŭrhae cycle (9週 乙亥) arrived, and the Qing court approved the investiture of Sunjong as Crown Prince (純宗 冊儲), adding security to Queen Myŏngsŏng's power. Simultaneously, the state of affairs took a sharp turn (急轉直下) from isolation (鎖國) to opening the country and foreign relations (開國交外). Our people, who had considered the single district of the peninsula (半島一區) a utopia like the Peach Blossom Spring (武陵桃源) and were deeply immersed (沉酣) in the long night's dark dream (長夜昏夢), were suddenly thrown onto the new stage of survival competition among the jostling great powers. It was only natural, exceedingly natural, that they would reveal clumsiness and invite insult (露拙招侮) at every turn (觸處). However, although mere remnants (殘骸), as long as the path to officialdom via exams remained and the Way of Learning remained, the material for passing time (消閑材料) for Korean scholars was not entirely lacking even then. Those driven by the desire for office (宦慾) aligned themselves with the Min faction or the Yun faction (閔邊과 雲邊 - "Yun" likely refers to Yun clan influence, possibly associated with Queen Sunjeonghyo, last empress, or earlier Yun factions), buzzing (營營하게) like flies chasing the stink (逐臭의 蒼蠅) wherever political power lay at the time. The reclusive scholars with wide sleeves under the forest (林下廣袖客), boasting of "Spring and Autumn Annals righteousness" (春秋義理), still busied themselves submitting sealed memorials (封章) rejecting the Japanese and Westerners, dreaming foolish dreams (痴夢) of being honored in Confucian shrines (書院에 俎豆될) for "Revering China and Expelling Barbarians" (尊中國攘夷狄). After several decades of such struggle for profit (上下交征利) by both upper and lower classes, the Kapo year arrived, then the Chŏngmi year, and finally, in the Kyŏngo year, the curtain fell (全幕을 닷치게 되엿다). This year, Ŭrhae, indeed corresponds to the 10th cycle (10週 甲) since the first one mentioned. Where are those people now who stubbornly (머리악을 쓰든) formed factions (結黨作朋) competing for fame and pursuing profit? Only His Excellency Governor-General Ugaki (宇垣總督大人), infused with lively (潑剌) vigor from three cups of New Year's spiced sake (屠蘇三盃) at the Ryokusentei Official Residence (綠泉亭官邸), is adding new effort (馬力), striving for the revitalization injection (振興注射) of farming, mountain, and fishing villages (農山漁村) under the slogan of "Self-Reliance and Rebirth" (自力更生).

As described above, Korean factional strife has an inseparable relationship <9> with the Ŭrhae year. Particularly, the Ŭrhae year of King Sŏnjo's reign is a memorable year for partisans, as the East-West division (東西分黨) was finalized then. However, just as the Western proverb says, "Rome was not built in a day" (羅馬는 하로 날에 된 羅馬가 아니라), the division in Sŏnjo's Ŭrhae year was by no means solely a product of that day; one must not forget that all the elements and conditions originated (發端) from King Sejo's acceptance of the throne following King Tanjong's Ŭrhae abdication. To put it more precisely, if Grand Prince Suyang (首陽大君) had truly contented himself with being like the Duke of Zhou (周公), Ji Dan (姬旦), the uncle of King Cheng of Zhou, and had not emulated the actions of the usurping King Zhu Di (蕪王棣 - likely a mistake for 永樂帝 Zhu Di), there would have been no reason for the restoration movement (復辟運動) of Sŏng Sam-mun and his colleagues. Consequently, the tragedy of Ch'ŏngnyŏngp'o in Yŏngwŏl would not have occurred, and Kim Chong-jik (金宗直) would have had no need to learn the "brush style of the old man from Ziyang" (紫陽老筆 - i.e., Zhu Xi) and compose the "Lament for Emperor Yi" (弔義帝文) to indirectly express (寓洩) his loyal indignation. Furthermore, the tyrannical act of suppressing scholars and banning books (抗士禁書), which became the primary cause of King Yŏnsan's misrule (燕山失政), would not have happened. Also, King Chungjong (中宗) could have spent his life as a prince in wealth, peace, and happiness without the Pyŏngin Restoration (丙寅反正), fulfilling a hundred years of harmonious companionship (百年白首의 偕好) with Queen Sin (愼王后), to whom he was deeply attached as a spouse (伉儷誼篤). Queen Munjŏng (文定王后) too might have married into a common scholar-official family (閭閻士夫家) and lived a pure, peaceful, and leisurely life (淸淨寧逸한 생활). No matter how treacherous, greedy, and cruel Yun Wŏn-hyŏng (尹元衡) might have been, would he not have ended up merely as a dissolute ruffian (酒色無賴의 乾達子弟)? Considering this, King Tanjong's Ŭrhae year is truly the ancestral Ŭrhae year of factional strife, and King Sejo bears the responsibility for initiating the calamity (作俑之責이 잇는 것이다). The various monarchs who later fully experienced (飽嘗) the factional calamity and suffered all kinds of hardships – Kings Sŏnjo, Kwanghae, Sukchong, Yŏngjo – were essentially just reaping the seeds sown by their ancestor. They themselves made no particular contribution nor committed any specific error in this regard. Furthermore, the origin of the East-West division truly stemmed from the discord between the scholar class (士類) and the queen's relatives (戚里). Sim Ŭi-gyŏm (沈義謙), the founder of the Westerner faction (西人), was ostracized by the Easterner scholars (東人士類) as someone from the consort family (戚) who greedily sought power and influence (貪權樂勢), disturbed the court discipline (朝網), and harmed righteous men (正人). However, in reality, Sim Ŭi-gyŏm, despite being from the consort family, committed no crime of wielding power or harming the wise (弄權害賢). On the contrary, he had considerable merit (宜力) in eliminating Yun Wŏn-hyŏng and played a role in protecting and promoting the scholar class after the purges and calamities (斬伐禍喪之餘). Then why was Sim ostracized by the scholars? Essentially, it was not Sim's own fault; the name "consort relative" (戚里) itself was regarded as a rare opportunity (奇貨) by the scholars. The reason consort relatives became targets of scholar dissatisfaction was entirely due to Han Myŏng-hoe (韓明澮) preceding him and Yun Wŏn-hyŏng following him. Thus, Sim merely ended up paying vicariously for the debt of sins (罪孼의 債務) left behind by Han and Yun, burdened by his position as an imperial relative by marriage (外戚). In this respect too, Han Myŏng-hoe – who was in Sejo's inner circle (帷幕), crafted the script for the Ŭrhae succession, had his name inscribed four times in the Lin Pavilion (麟閣) as a prime meritorious subject (元勳), and became the father-in-law of two kings, satisfying his heaven-shaking (掀天) desire for wealth and glory and world-covering (蓋世) ambition for fame and profit – cannot escape responsibility as the source of the calamity (禍首). In short, it is an undeniable fact that the Ŭrhae year, when King Tanjong relinquished the throne, holds a crucial (關鍵的) position in the history of the Yi Dynasty palace and Korean factional strife.

The ancients said, "Knowing characters is the beginning of worry and trouble" (識字가 憂患之始). At first hearing, it seems utterly unreasonable, but if one ponders (細嚼) its meaning, it is indeed a maxim that could not be uttered without having fully experienced (飽閱) worldly affairs and knowing firsthand what worry and trouble (憂患) entail. Even today, 480 years later, hearing about the grievous, cruel, tragic, and painful (寃酷慘痛) things King Tanjong suffered <10> from the Kyeyu year to the Chŏngchuk year evokes resentment and discontent (憤菀不平) in the listener. How much more so for those who witnessed these events at the time? Anyone with even a little human feeling, would they not have clenched their fists and wept with anger (扼腕裂眥)? Setting others aside, King Sejo himself, in his later years, felt remorse and deep emotion (懺悔感慨), suffering extreme agony – this is a clear fact. However, regarding Sejo's actions, if one felt discontent, one could raise a righteous army like Yi Po-gŭm (李甫欽), or failing that, feign madness and withdraw (佯狂自廢) like Master Maewŏltang Kim Si-sŭp (梅月堂 金時習). But for Kim Chong-jik (金宗直) – who traveled far from Miryang to the capital immediately after the Chŏngchuk Incident, was selected in the state examination personally overseen by Sejo, placed himself on the court register (朝籍), served in that court through three reigns (三朝を歷事), and then retired as a respected elder (元老) with the rank of Minister of Punishments (刑曹判書), receiving especially immense favor (恩*) and special treatment (偏被) during King Sŏngjong's reign – for him, it was not the proper position to compose a "Lament for Emperor Yi" (弔義帝文) based on Xiang Yu's (項羽) usurpation and regicide (纂弑). Nor did he have the moral justification (義理) to make a great show of having learned Zhu Xi's (朱子) *Gangmu* (綱目) brush style. Even so, if he had kept it privately in his cloth box (巾笥) to perhaps include in his collected works (文集), it might be excusable. But to boldly record it in the draft history (史草) and insert it into the official Veritable Records (王朝實錄) of the dynasty is, no matter how one thinks about it, an action deviating from common sense. If his loyal indignation was truly unbearable, why did he not write the facts directly (直書), clearly recording "On month X, day Y, person A murdered his lord B" (某月日에 某가 弑其君某), and emulate Fang Xiaoru (方孝孺), who boldly wrote "The Yan Bandit Usurped the Throne" (燕賊簒位)? If this was the wild ambition (野慾) of a scholar seeking to deceive the world and steal fame (欺世盜名), aiming to monopolize both profit in life and reputation after death, then there is no room for further discussion. However, since Master Kim Chong-jik was a commendable scholar revered by his generation (一代가 宗師하든) for his character and learning (人格과 學議), I will refrain from misinterpreting (曲揣) his intentions (心事) with such base thoughts. Seen this way, ultimately, Master Kim Chong-jik, while feeling indignant (憤惋) about the affairs of the time like an ordinary person, still took the civil service exam and served in office for the sake of livelihood (口腹) and fame and profit (名利). The only conclusion is that, being more knowledgeable in letters and skilled in composition than ordinary people, he suffered from the 'illness' (病) of impulsively (發作的) composing unimportant (不緊) writings. Why call it an illness? Broadly examining the trail of calamity and ruin (禍敗) caused by the single piece "Lament for Emperor Yi," we find these errors: eating the ruler's salary while slandering him (食祿詆君) is one fault; failing to conceal the ruler's faults (爲君諱惡) is another; knowing this yet taking the exam and pursuing an official career (赴科從宦) is another; receiving King Sŏngjong's favor yet slandering and insulting his ancestor (詆辱君祖) is another; failing to be clear and direct, instead using indirect allusion and satire (萬託刺諷), is another; attempting to have it publicly recorded in history (史乘に公載), thereby causing a great calamity, allowing petty men to seize the opportunity to cause trouble (乘機跳梁), stimulating the ruler's murderous intent (殺機) and initiating tyrannical suppression of Confucian scholars (抗儒の暴擧), is another; causing disaster to spread to the innocent (無辜에게 延禍) and destroying (剝喪) the vitality (元氣) of the time is another; as a respected elder (元老宿德) who received favor across three reigns (受恩三朝), bringing the Yi Dynasty's state altars (李氏 宗社) to the brink of dynastic change (易姓の禍), is another; creating the prologue to factional strife (黨禍の序幕) and bringing calamity upon homes and the nation (禍人家國) for over 300 years is another. With these ten faults (10失), he inflicted harm greater than floods and fierce beasts upon the world. If he did it knowingly, he was a thief of fame and profit (名利の盜人); if he did it unknowingly, it was the illness of literacy (識字の病). This is what I consider a fair judgment. How devastating the harm caused by the pedantic adherence (迂闊) of decadent scholars to Neo-Confucianism is, and how much literary games (文字遊戱) lead oneself and others astray – anyone who reads the history of the Muo Purge during Yŏnsan's reign (燕山 戊午史) will naturally understand (諒會). <11>

**Summary**

The author, Kanggyo Sanin, writing in 1935, argues that Korea's destructive factional strife (黨爭), while peaking in the Chosŏn Dynasty, originated in Koryŏ with the adoption of the exam system and Neo-Confucianism, which turned scholars into competitors for fame and profit. He posits a cyclical connection between this strife and years designated by the Ŭrhae (乙亥) sign in the sexagenary cycle, tracing key events from Yi Sŏng-gye's birth through the Sejo usurpation, the East-West split, later factional escalations, and up to the late Chosŏn period under growing external pressures. He criticizes figures like Kim Chong-jik for actions deemed hypocritical and harmful, contrasting them with revered figures like the Six Ministers, King Sejong, and Yi Sun-sin. The article concludes by noting the 10th Ŭrhae cycle under Japanese rule, observing the apparent end of Chosŏn's internal struggles and the implementation of Governor-General Ugaki's rural development policies ("Self-Reliance and Rebirth").

From a colonial history perspective, the article is interesting for its attempt to frame Korea's historical weaknesses (factionalism) through a deterministic cyclical lens (the Ŭrhae connection), perhaps subtly justifying the current state under colonial rule as an endpoint to these internal failings. The author's selective praise and criticism of historical figures reflect a particular nationalist, yet possibly fatalistic, interpretation of the past. The concluding mention of Governor-General Ugaki Kazushige and his policies, presented factually without overt critique, is significant, placing contemporary colonial administration within this long historical narrative of strife and its cessation. Historians might find the author's specific interpretation of events, the emphasis on cyclical history, and the juxtaposition of past strife with present colonial order valuable for understanding intellectual currents and historical consciousness in 1930s Korea.

乙亥와 朝鮮
						江郊散人
내-開闢誌의 의뢰에 應하야 朝鮮의 黨爭史를 敍述하기에 손을 대여 임의 2회를 거듭하얏섯다. 文辭가 蕪拙한 가닭에 瑩徹치 못한 點이 만흔 것은 스사로 豫期하야 愧恨하는 바이다. 그러나 이제까지 서술한 것은 朝鮮의 黨禍가 비록 李朝에 니르러 慘烈을 極한 것은 사실이나 그 源委를 溯究하면 高麗 光宗時代에 벌서 太祖開國 當初의 洪圖宏謨를 일코 歸化人 『雙冀』에 의하야 科試制度를 창시하고 專혀 詩賦의 文詞로써 인재를 등용하게 되여 功令科宦이 士子의 必爭하는 길을 열고 高宗 이후로 元朝 帝室과 특수한 誼好를 맷게 된 뒤로부터 宋儒의 理學이 滔滔하게 유입되며 崇佛의 餘弊에 인한 반동의 더욱 拍車를 다러 唐나라 韓愈와 宋나라 朱熹가 300년의 間隔을 두고 서로 점거하랴고 고심하든 道監眞儒(실상인즉 儒迂의 氣習에서 생긴 痴事)의 일홈이 이것을 더욱 조장하고 완성케 하얏다. 그리하야 소위 幼學壯行을 期하야 致君澤民, 修齋治平을 이상으로 하는 선비들이 名을 野에서 爭하고 利를 朝에서 爭하야 선비의 본색을 일코 多利의 商賈가 되고 말엇다. 벌서 商賈가 되엇스니 그들의 안중에는 승패가 잇슬 뿐이오 승패에 따러 사활이 分岐되는 이상에 그 투쟁에는 陰險환 術畧 惡辣한 수단, 醜卑한 離合이 수반될 것은 免치 못할 理勢이오. 따러서 李朝 때의 그것이 저와가티 劇甚하든 것이 怪할 것이 업다는 것을 略論하얏섯다. 그리하야 李氏 開國劈頭에 이러난 靖安君 對 芳碩世子의 事變이란 것이 王氏를 覆亡식힌 無耻의 名利俳優가 漢陽新舞臺에서 연출한 戱曲의 서막이다. 뒤를 니여 端宗癸酉에 생긴 靖難事件은 小中華로 자처하는 朝鮮사람이 明나라 永樂帝의 지여노흔 각본을 가저다가 模倣演奏함에 지내지 못하것이니 要하건대 시대와 처소가 다를 뿐이지 한가지도 우리의 創作이 아니오 依然히 李世民과 朱棣의 舊劇을 朝鮮俳優가 朝鮮式으로 하든 까닭에 舞臺가 좁고 인물이 低小한이만티 촌극의 觀이 잇슬뿐이다. 그러나 오즉 一貫한 주의정신은 名利鬪爭에 잇는 것이다. 世祖丙子에 上王復位 密謀가 綻露되여 그 주모자이든 成三問이 世祖에게 酷刑을 밧고＜7＞동지와 함께 최후의 형장으로 끌녀 나갈 때에 得意翔翔하는 名利派의 政敵大官을 도라보며
『너희들은 어지신 인군을 도와 태평치세를 만들고 福과 利를 무궁하게 받으라 三問은 오즉 일편단심을 가저다가 世宗, 文宗의 두 분 先王께 삼가 奉納할 뿐이이다.』
唱破하얏다. 얼마나 名利에 초연하고 凜烈慷慨한 참 선비 참 丈夫의 金鐵같은 一言이냐. 그럼으로 나는 恒言하기를 李朝 500년史를 통하야 成三問 等 六臣이 업섯스면 남어지는 權鬼와 祿虫뿐이오 栗谷이 업섯스면 腐儒와 書*뿐이오 崔濟愚 全琫準이 업스면 민중을 위하야 吐氣할 義民이 업섯다 한다. 그리고 世宗大王이 아니 게시고 李忠武公이 아니게섯다면 아무리 이상 2,3子가 잇섯다 하야도 東國通鑑은 陰冷한 死氣로 全紙를 가리여 一讀할 가치도 업다고 斷言하랴한다.

前回에서 말한 癸酉靖難의 뒤를 니은 사건은 乙亥禪位이다. 이 乙亥는 지금부터 480년인즉 今年 乙亥는 그의 第 8週 干支에 상당하다. 그런데 乙亥가 드는 干支의 太歲와 李朝 黨爭史와는 우연일지라도 기적적으로 불가분의 인연이 至重한 해이다. 첫재 李氏 創業의 主이신 太祖가 高麗忠肅王後 4년 乙亥에 탄생하야 500년 왕업을 싸을 생명의 呱呱 第一聲을 永興 땅에서 울니엿고 一週甲되는 乙亥메는 그 前 해 甲戌에 漢陽 尊都를 결정하야 新朝廷의 威權確立하는 大工役이 *掌되는 一方에 芳碩新世子를 冊封하야 朝臣이 2派로 갈녀 軋轢하얏고 2週甲 乙亥는 端宗禪讓으로 六臣의 비밀계획이 생겨 翌年 丙子의 士禍와 又 翌年 寧越, 順興의 참변이 胚胎되엿고 3週甲 乙亥에는 仁宗誕生과 章敬王后 薨逝로부터 金沖庵, 趙靜庵 一派의 年少 儒士에 의하야 靖國勳臣에게 無放迫黜되신 愼妃復位가 제의되여 朝鮮에 큰 是非問題가 될 뿐아니라 이것이 동기로 勳舊와 淸流사이에 다시 合流치 못할 溝渠를 하게되여 필경 己卯 北門의 禍와 後年 大小尹의 투쟁이 생기여 乙巳, 丁未, 己酉의 滔天大獄이 니러낫고 尹元衡의 貧權樂禍의 餘波가 4週 乙亥되는 宣祖大王 8년에 비로소 東西黨論의 원인을 지여 色目이 확립하야 伊來 300년 혈투의 禍機를 지엇고 第 5週 乙亥에는 淸朝新興에 際하야 그에 대한 服事和好問題로 和斥兩論이 분연히 니러나 崔鳴吉 金時讓 鄭忠信 等의 續盟緩禍說을 包圍하고 元勳 金瑬 이하로 慷慨激昻하는 春秋義理派의 名士들이 或은 口舌로 或은 문장으로 尊周攘夷論을 力倡하야 明나라 廷臣과 士子들의 안색이 업슬만티 떠들다가 結局 丙子大難을 불너 丁丑 南漢의 羞辱으로 出揚한 뒤에도 孝宗嗣位와 함께 北伐計劃을 수립함에 따러 賢士를 廣求하게 되매 山林隱逸의 儒士들이 旌招滿朝하야 講武練兵하기 전에 理學과 禮論을 싸호게 되니 그것이나마 創意와 自說은 업고 漢, 唐, 宋의 남의 나라 사람의 糟粕을 주워다가 曰是曰非로 서로 庇議하얏스니 腐儒들로는 無上大事業이 될는지＜8＞모르나 國計와 民命은 辯髦에 돌니고 黨禍를 激成하야 殺戮으로써 仇怨을 報復하는 비통한 활극이 반복되엿다. 그것이 60년 후의 6週 乙亥되는 肅宗 21년 와서는 前年 甲戌閔后 復位와 함께 張希載 處分問題로 從來 南, 西 당쟁 외에 또 老, 少 新黨의 갈등과 不睦이 일층 격렬하다가 景宗辛壬의 禍原을 만들엇고 또 60년 후의 7週 乙亥는 英祖 31년인대 黨禍에 懲하신 英祖께옵서 蕩平策을 써서 피차를 조화코자 하얏스나 公私兩方으로 血怨骨讐가 된 各派 黨人은 도저히 融解되지 못하얏다. 그러다가 이 해에 申致雲의 獄이 잇서 老論의 보복을 두려워하는 少論이 일제히 自訟䟽를 올녀 辛壬 以來의 주장을 一擲하는 동시에 老論은 『闡義昭鑑』을 만들어 金石의 國是로 정하고 勝鬨을 올녓다. 英祖는 이로써 『一隅海東, 乾坤重明』을 깃버하섯스나 당화가 이로써 풀닐 이치가 업섯다. 그 鬱結醞釀된 毒菌이 宮圍에 跳梁하든 狐鼠輩손으로 壬午大變을 니르키게 되엿는데 思悼世子의 正嫡血胤이신 正祖는 오히려 『明義錄』을 刊布하면서 元兇 金龜柱의 首領을 保障치 안으면 못하게 되엿다. 그리하야 8週 乙亥의 純祖 15년에 惠慶宮(莊祖正后)이 血淚로 凝結된 일생을 絡了하시며 時辟의 싸움은 闇에서 闇으로 葬하고 그보담 압서서 金祖淳과 李相璜의 妥協으로 당쟁도 표면으로 終熄되며 戚里의 世道로 內外政務가 진행되더니 高宗 甲子부터 興宣大院君이 外戚과 交代하야 政柄을 잡고 得意의 鎖國政策을 쓰다가 안에서는 明成后의 교묘한 책동이 잇고 外로는 李鴻章이 강압으로 『輔政』의 지위를 떠나 楊州直洞에서 悶悶의 세월을 보내는 사이에 9週 乙亥가 되며 淸廷은 純宗 冊儲를 승인하야 明成后의 권력에 보장을 加하게 되엿다. 동시에 시국도 鎖國으로부터 開國交外로 急轉直下하야 半島一區를 武陵桃源으로 알고 長夜昏夢에 沉酣하든 우리사람이 갑작이 열강각축하는 생존 경쟁의 신무대에 뛰여 오르니 觸處마다 露拙招侮할 것은 당연에 지내는 당연이다. 그러나 비록 잔해일망정 科宦이 남어 잇고 道學이 남어 잇는 限에 朝鮮선비의 消閑材料는 그때까지도 全乏치 아니하얏다. 宦慾에 띄인 者는 閔邊과 雲邊을 표방하야 그때 그때의 정권잇는 곶에 逐臭의 蒼蠅처럼 營營하게 몰니고 春秋義理를 자랑하는 林下廣袖客은 의연히 斥倭斥洋의 封章을 일삼어 『尊中國攘夷狄』으로 서원에 俎豆될 痴夢을 꾸고 잇섯다. 이와같이 上下交征利數 10년 후에는 甲午年이 오고 丁未年이 왓다가 庚午年에야 전막을 닷치게 되엿다. 금년 乙亥는 실로 그 10週 甲 되는 干支에 상당하거니와 當年의 爭名逐利로 結黨作朋하기에 머리악을 쓰든 그 사람들이 爾今에 安在하고 오즉 綠泉亭官邸에서 屠蘇三盃로 潑剌한 元氣를 띄인 宇垣總督大人이 새로 馬力을 加하야 『自力更生』의 표어로써 農山漁村의 振興注射에 힘쓰고 잇슬 뿐이다.

右述한 것과 가티 朝鮮의 당쟁은 乙亥와 불가분의 관계가＜9＞잇는데 특히 宣祖 乙亥는 東西分黨이 완성되든 黨人의 기념할 만한 해이다. 그러나 『羅馬는 하로 날에 된 羅馬가 아니라』는 西諺과 가티 宣祖 乙亥의 분당이란 것도 결코 분당 그 날의 분당이 아니오 모든 요소와 조건은 端宗 乙亥을 世祖 受禪으로부터 발단된 것을 망각하야서는 아니된다. 한번 더 자세하게 말하자면 首陽大君이 명실이 共히 周成王의 叔父 『姬旦』 周公으로써 自滿하고 蕪王棣의 행사를 배우지 안엇드면 成三問 諸公의 復辟運動이 생길 이유가 업섯고 따러서 寧越淸冷浦의 비극이 업섯스며 金宗直으로 하야금 『紫陽老筆』을 배워 忠憤을 寓洩한다는 弔義帝文이 이 세상에 나올 필요가 업섯고 燕山失政의 第一 大因이 되든 抗士禁書의 亂暴가 니러나지 안엇슬 것이다. 그리고 中宗은 丙寅反正이 업시 一王子로써 富貴安樂의 일생을 보내며 伉儷誼篤하든 愼王后와 百年白首의 偕好를 遂하얏슬 것이오 文定王后도 閭閻士夫家에 出嫁하야 淸淨寧逸한 생활을 하얏슬 것이오. 尹元衡이가 아무리 奸險貪毒하다 하여도 일개 酒色無賴의 乾達子弟로 了揚하얏슬 것이 안인가. 그리고 보면 端宗 乙亥는 실로 당쟁 乙亥의 始祖되는 乙亥年이며 世祖大王이 黨禍의 作俑之責이 잇는 것이다. 후일에 黨禍를 飽嘗하야 가즌 고통을 격그시든 宣祖, 光海, 肅宗, 英祖의 여러분 君王은 要하건대 조상이 뿌려 노흐신 종자를 收穫함에 지내지 못하고 당신들로는 별다른 공헌도 업섯고 過語도 업든 것이다. 그리고 東西分黨의 기원은 실로 士類와 戚里의 不睦에서 생긴 것인대 西人의 黨祖이든 沈義謙은 東人士類가 써戚의 몸으로 貪權樂勢하야 朝網을 어지럽게 하며 正人을 害하는 者이라 배척하얏스나 그러나 실상인즉 沈義謙은 戚里로서 何等 弄權害賢한 죄가 업슬뿐 아니라 反히 尹元衡 退治에 不少한 宜力이 잇서 斬伐禍喪之餘의 士類를 扶護伸長하는데 功勞가 잇든 사람이다. 그러면 何故로 沈이 士類에게 배척을 밧게되엿는가? 그것도 要하건대 沈의 자신 罪過가 아니오 戚里라는 일홈이 士類들의써 奇貨로 녁이든 것이오 戚里가 士類의 불평대상이 된 것은 전혀 韓明澮가 前에 잇고 尹元衡이 後에 잇섯든 까닭인 즉 沈은 韓과 尹이 남기고 간 罪孼의 債務를 外戚이라는 지위에 累한 바가되여 代理로써 淸償함에 불과한 것인 즉 이 점에서도 世祖의 帷幕에 잇서 乙亥受禪의 각본을 꿈여내고 네 번을 元勳으로 麟閣에 題名하며 두 번을 군왕의 丈人이 되여 掀天의 부귀와 蓋世의 名利心을 만족하든 韓明澮가 禍首의 責을 免치 못할 것이니 一言으로써 蔽하면 端宗이 왕위에서 물너안든 乙亥年에 李朝王宮史와 朝鮮黨爭史에 在하야 關鍵的 위치에 잇는 것이 動치 못할 사실이다.

古人은 『識字가 憂患之始』라고 말하얏다. 얼는 드르면 無理하기가 짝이 업지만은 그 의미를 細嚼하고 보면 과연 世故를 飽閱하고 憂患이라는 것이 여하한 것을 체험치 안코는 道破치 못할 격언이다. 癸酉로부터 丁丑에 그동안 端宗의 所遭하신＜10＞ 寃酷慘痛한 일은 480여년을 지낸 今日에도 듯는 者가 오히려 憤菀不平하거든 허물며 그 당시에 잇서 그 사실을 목격하는 사람으로야 저윽이 인심이 잇스면 누가 扼腕裂眥치 아니하얏스랴. 他人은 막론하고 世祖大王 자신이 임의 晩年에는 懺悔感慨하야 극도로 고민하신 역역한 사실이 잇다. 그러나 세조의 處事에 대하야 불평이 잇것든 李甫欽과 가티 의병을 니르키거나 그럿치 못하거든 梅月堂 金時習 선생처럼 佯狂自廢하는 것은 모르되 丁丑事變이 잇든 직후에 멀니 密陽으로부터 상경하야 世祖의 親臨下에 科試에 뽑히여 朝籍에 몸을 실꼬 그 조정에 벼슬하야 三朝를 歷事한 뒤에는 刑曹判書로 致仕元老가 되고 특히 成宗朝에는 恩*을 偏被하야 무한한 寃過를 받은 金宗直 그로서는 項羽의 纂弑에 의하야 『弔義帝文』을 지을 처지가 되지 못하는 것이오 스사로 朱子의 綱目筆法을 배웟노라 大書特書할 義理가 되지 못한다. 그럿타 할지라도 개인이 巾笥에 收藏하얏다가 文集에나 올닌다 하면 오히려 모르거니와 당당히 史草에 記入하야 王朝實錄에 집어 덧는 것은 아무리 생각하야도 상식에 버서난 행동이다. 그대지 忠憤에 견듸지 못한다면 엇지하야 사실을 直書하야 『某月日에 某가 弑其君某』라고 명백하게 기록하고 『燕賊簒位』를 大書하든 方孝孺를 追距치 못하는가 이것이 欺世盜名으로써 생전의 利와 사후의 名을 並占하랴는 儒士의 野慾이라하면 다시 논의할 여지도 업스려니와 적어도 金宗直 그 분은 인격과 學議에 잇서 一代가 宗師하든 갸륵한 선비인만티 이와같은 醜卑한 일로써 그 心事를 曲揣치 안으랴 한다. 그리고보면 결국 金宗直 선생도 보통사람과 同樣으로 時事에 憤惋하면서 口腹과 名利를 위하야 科試도 보고 사환은 하지만은 오즉 보통사람 이상으로 문자를 알고 문장에 능하든 病이 잇서 不緊한 글을 發作的으로 짓게한 것이라고 볼 수 밧게 업는 것이다. 엇지하야 病이라 하는가. 大抵 『弔義帝文』 一篇으로 인하야 생긴 禍敗의 자취를 檢討하면 食祿詆君한 것이 一失이오 爲君諱惡치 못한 것이 一失이오 그런줄 알면서 赴科從宦한 것이 一失이오 成宗의 恩寃을 밧으면서 詆辱君祖한 것이 一失이요 明白直截치 못하고 萬託刺諷한 것이 一失이요 史乘에 公載하랴다가 大禍를 니르키여 小人으로 乘機跳梁케하고 人主의 殺機를 刺戟하야 抗儒의 폭거를 개시한 것이 一失이오 無辜에게 延禍케하야 一時의 元氣를 剝喪케한 것이 一失이오 受恩三朝한 元老宿德으로서 李氏 宗社가 하마하면 易姓의 화를 免치 못하게 한 것이 一失이오 黨禍의 서막을 지여 300여년을 禍人家國케한 것이 一失이다. 이와가티 10失이 잇서 洪水와 猛獸以上의 害氣을 세상에 끼첫스니 알면서 한 일이면 名利의 盜人이오 모르고 한 일이면 識字의 病이라 하는 것이 공정한 판단이라 한다. 腐儒의 理學迂襲한 害가 얼마나 慘烈한 것인지 또 文字遊戱가 얼마나 自誤하며 誤人하는 것인지 燕山 戊午史를 一讀한 사람이면 스사로 諒會할 것이 잇슬 것이다. ＜11＞
