The Government-General's plan for Korean migration to Manchuria is steadily progressing, and to implement this on a broader scale, it is said that a semi-governmental, semi-private migration company with capital of 50 million to 100 million yen will be established in Dalian. Furthermore, it is said that this fiscal year, they will carry out the migration of 2 million Korean farmers to Manchuria, comprising 240,000 households (1 million people) through free migration and 200,000 households (1 million people) through arranged migration, totaling 400,000 households and 2 million people.

The migration method involves a ten-year plan, with 20,000 households (100,000 people) for free migration and 20,000 households (100,000 people) for arranged migration each year, totaling 40,000 households (200,000 people) annually. It is said they have decided to provide a long-term loan of 800 to 1,000 yen per household, repayable over 15 years. Since last November, over 78,000 Korean farmers have migrated within Manchukuo, among whom group farmers numbered over 50,000 and free migrants numbered 38,000. The migration destinations are said to be Fengtian Province, Jilin, Heilongjiang Province, and other areas.

**Summary**

This news report details the Japanese Government-General's advancing plan to relocate two million Korean farmers to Manchuria. A large, semi-governmental migration company capitalized at 50-100 million yen is planned for Dalian to manage the process. The ten-year plan aims to move 400,000 households (2 million people) through a mix of 'free' and 'arranged' migration, offering long-term loans of 800-1,000 yen per household. Recent figures indicate over 78,000 Koreans already migrated to regions like Fengtian, Jilin, and Heilongjiang since late 1934. For historians, this article highlights the scale and systematic nature of Japan's colonial migration policy in the 1930s, aimed at settling Manchuria with Korean farmers, likely to consolidate control and exploit agricultural resources. The distinction between 'free' and 'arranged' migration, the establishment of a dedicated company, and the provision of loans reveal key mechanisms of this state-sponsored population movement. The numerical inconsistencies within the article itself might also be of interest.
