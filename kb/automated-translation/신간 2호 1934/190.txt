笑話數題
(Several Jokes)

Samch'on: "Hey Poknam, do you know where the New Year comes from?"
Poknam: "Of course, I know! It comes from the first corner of that calendar (月曆) over there!"

Mother: "Who scooped up and ate the sikhye that was placed here?"
*Nam: "Well, I saw Older Sister scoop and eat it earlier, but I can't tell you because I'm afraid I'll get beaten later!"

Kilnam: "Father, where are you going?"
Father: "I'm going to buy a calendar."
Kilnam: "Then please buy the one with the most holidays!"<81>

**Summary**

This short article presents three simple jokes involving conversations between adults and children. The jokes rely on childish misunderstandings or naive honesty: a boy thinks the new year literally emerges from the calendar, another child refuses to snitch for fear of punishment, and a third child requests a calendar with the maximum number of holidays. For historians, this piece offers a glimpse into everyday humor and family interactions during the colonial period. The language, including older spellings (e.g., "놧든," "마질까 바서," "만흔") and terminology ("공일날" for holiday), provides linguistic data points for the 1930s. The focus on simple, universal childhood themes might also subtly reflect the kinds of light content deemed acceptable or popular in publications under censorship.
