Passing Nogo Lake and Mourning at the Tombs of the Six Martyred Ministers
						By Wŏlt'an

Walking about half a *ri* east from Noryangjin Station in Pon-dong-ni, Puk-myŏn, Sihŭng-gun, on a not particularly high eastern foothill, lie the south-facing tombs of the Six Martyred Ministers. Behind them, the Han River flows turbulently, and in front, the newly constructed Kyŏngin Highway lies across. King Tanjong, the 6th monarch of the Yi Dynasty, succeeded his father King Munjong and ascended the throne in the Imsin year (1452), at the tender age of just 12. In the Kyeyu year (1453), Munjong's immediate younger brother and Tanjong's uncle, Grand Prince Suyang (later King Sejo), whose ambitions were surging, first sought to seize control of the nation's military command and occupy the position of Chief State Councilor. He accused the ministers Hwangbo In and Kim Chong-sŏ, who had received the late King's dying command, of secretly colluding with Grand Prince Anp'yŏng* to plot treason. Pretending to pay a private visit to Kim Chong-sŏ, he had strongmen strike his head, beat Hwangbo In to death at the palace gate, and coerced King Tanjong into ordering the execution of Anp'yŏng. Kim Chong-sŏ was a great minister with the bearing of a tiger-like general, while Anp'yŏng was Munjong's third younger brother and Suyang's next younger sibling, renowned at the time for his literary talent and calligraphy, possessing a magnanimous and unrestrained* nature, making him a rival whom Suyang most dreaded.

Having thus eliminated the figures he feared, Suyang appointed himself Chief State Councilor and seized military command. Three years later, in the Ŭlhae year (1455), he finally usurped the throne, becoming King, and made Tanjong the King Emeritus, moving him to Suganggung Palace (now Ch'anggyŏngwŏn) to deceive the public and fearing intervention from Ming China. However, how could the murmurs within the royal family be silenced? He framed his elder half-brother, Prince Hwaŭi (Yŏng), sending him into exile, and banished his fifth younger brother, Grand Prince Kŭmsŏng (Yu), to Saknyŏng.<14> The following year, in the sixth month of the Pyŏngja year (1456), when the Ming envoy entered the T'aep'yŏnggwan (reception hall), officials who had deeply received the favor of three generations (Sejong, Munjong, Tanjong) – Vice Minister Sŏng Sam-mun, Vice Minister Pak P'aeng-nyŏn, Vice Minister Ha Wi-ji, Direct Appointee Yi Kae, General Yu Ŭng-bu, Master of Arts Yu Sŏng-wŏn, Commander Sŏng Sŭng (Sam-mun's father), Tanjong's father-in-law Kwŏn Cha-sin, Special Cloud Sword Pak Chŏng, Master of Arts Kim Chil, and others – took this opportunity to plot the restoration of the King Emeritus. Unfortunately, due to the change of heart and betrayal by Kim Chil, the plot was exposed. The Six Ministers (Sŏng Sam-mun, Pak P'aeng-nyŏn, Yi Kae, Ha Wi-ji, Yu Ŭng-bu, Yu Sŏng-wŏn) (Yu Sŏng-wŏn committed suicide by cutting his throat) were subjected to the most extreme punishment, executed at Saenamt'ŏ on the south bank of the Han River, and their descendants were annihilated. Fortunately, Pak P'aeng-nyŏn's son Sun's wife was pregnant and gave birth to a son. Pak's female servant also had a child, giving birth to a daughter. The loyal female servant secretly exchanged them and raised the boy. Later, his name became Il-san. It is said that only Pak's descendants continue the line uninterrupted to this day. After this incident, in June, King Tanjong's mother, Queen Hyŏndŏk of the Kwŏn clan, already deceased, was posthumously demoted. Grand Prince Kŭmsŏng, who had been placed in Saknyŏng, was moved again to Sunhŭng. In the autumn, in the seventh month, King Tanjong was given the heart-wrenching title Prince Nosan and confined to Ch'ŏngnyŏngp'o on the West River in the remote mountain valley of Yŏngwŏl. How rugged* and desolate was the young monarch's rough journey! Who among men could refrain from shedding bitter tears of righteous indignation? The famous song, "On a thousand-*ri* far path, parting from my dear lord, my heart finds no place, sitting by the stream. Even that water seems like my inner self, weeping through the night journey," expresses the sentiments of the State Tribunal Officer (禁府都事) at the time, who, after escorting the King Emeritus to Yŏngwŏl, hesitated at the ford across the stream, unable to bear leaving, and poured out his heart.

"The moon wishes to set, the cuckoo cries, holding sorrowful feelings, I lean on the pavilion railing. Your cry is sad, my hearing it is painful; if there were not your voice, there would be no my sorrow. I send word to the suffering* people of the world: be careful not to climb the Cuckoo Pavilion in the third month of spring." This reflects the plight of the young lord Tanjong, raised as a precious child (金枝玉葉) in the nine-layered palace, now finding no refuge in a remote valley thousands of *ri* away, where everything he encountered evoked sorrow. Every character is a hot tear,<15> every phrase a blood-boiling lament.

The following year, Chŏngch'uk (1457), Grand Prince Kŭmsŏng (Yu), confined in Sunhŭng, conspired with Magistrate Yi Po-ch'im, clasping hands and weeping whenever they met, plotting again for the restoration of Nosan. They communicated with Chŏng Chong (Tanjong's brother-in-law), Prince Hannam* (Suyang's younger half-brother), and Prince Yŏngp'ung (Ch'ŏn) (*'s full brother, born of Royal Concubine Hyebin of the Yang clan, Pak P'aeng-nyŏn's son-in-law). They rallied heroes from the south, mobilized troops in Sunhŭng, and issued a proclamation: "The Son of Heaven commands the feudal lords; who dares not obey?" Just as they were about to launch the restoration movement and shake the mountains and rivers, an affair between a government functionary (及+唱) in Sunhŭng and a palace maid of Kŭmsŏng ruined the grand plan, exposing the matter. Alas! Suyang once again had his younger brother Kŭmsŏng killed, Yŏng killed, * killed, and Ch'ŏn killed. He could not avoid killing his stepmother (* and Ch'ŏn's mother, Royal Concubine Hyebin of the Yang clan, who had nursed Tanjong). On October 24th, he finally committed the great crime, incurring the wrath of gods and men alike, sending the State Tribunal Officer Wang Pang-yŏn with poison to Prince Nosan. At that time, he was merely 17 years old. Is this something a human could do? It is fitting to close the book and stop the brush.

The narrative shifts back to the Pyŏngja year (1456). After the Six Ministers were executed at Saenamt'ŏ, Maewŏltang Kim Si-sŭp, disguised as a monk, carried their bodies away by night, buried them on the southern foothill, and unable to openly reveal their names, erected grave markers like those for women, inscribed "Tomb of Madam Pak," "Tomb of Madam Yu," "Tomb of Madam Yi," "Tomb of Madam Sŏng." Below the tombs, beside the road, stands a separate stone monument inscribed by Yi Hwi-ji under the command of King Chŏngjo. The inscription reads: "Alas, since these five tombs are marked with the surnames Pak, Yu, Yi, Sŏng, there is no doubt they belong to four gentlemen among the Six Ministers. There is also another Sŏng family tomb; this is said to be that of Mr. Sŏng's father, Sŭng, who suffered misfortune at the same time and was buried here. As for Mr. Ha's tomb, it is in Sŏnsan, Yŏngnam, containing only one body. The location of Mr. Yu [Sŏng-wŏn]'s tomb is entirely unknown."<16>

The *Chibong Yusŏl* states: "South of Noryang, three tombs stand together. People say they are the tombs of the Six Ministers, and all have markers inscribed 'Tomb of Madam Sŏng,' 'Tomb of Madam Pak,' 'Tomb of Madam Yu.' Hŏ Ha-gok (*篈) said that 'Madam' (氏) refers to women, but these three tombs are arranged together, clearly not women's. Men must have official titles, but here only surnames are used. Could it be that righteous men of the time gathered and buried three individuals here but dared not carve openly, thus using these designations? There is no doubt they are the tombs of Sŏng Sam-mun, Pak P'aeng-nyŏn, and Yu Ŭng-bu."

"After the Imjin Disturbance (壬辰變), someone visited; the carved stones were intact, but the characters were worn and almost illegible. What a pity!" it lamented.

According to the *History of Kyŏngsŏng Prefecture* (京城府史), "At the time the monument was erected and during the era of the *Yŏllyŏsil Kisul*, there were five tombs mentioned. In the era of the *Chibong Yusŏl*, there were three tombs, but currently, four tombs remain."

However, when I personally visited and examined the site, starting from the east on the southern foothill, there is a marker stone carved with lotus leaves inscribed "Tomb of Madam Pak." Four or five feet away, set slightly forward, is the "Tomb of Madam Yu." At about the same distance again, in line with Pak's tomb, is the "Tomb of Madam Yi." These three are within the same plot. Then, seven or eight steps further west, in a separately located spot, is the "Tomb of Madam Sŏng." Going much further down, to the southwest, in front of the small path ascending and descending this mountain, atop a mound overgrown with bushes where there is no actual grave mound, stands a lotus-leaf marker identical in size, shape, and carving. However, finding even a trace of characters is impossible. Could this not be the site of the "Tomb of the other Madam Sŏng," namely Sŏng Sŭng's grave, recorded in the *Yŏllyŏsil Kisul* and at the time of King Chŏngjo's monument construction? Has the tombstone eroded and the grave mound collapsed due to wind and rain? It is quite doubtful. I hope someone interested will investigate. It is said that a descendant of the Pak clan, belonging to the *No* (魯) character generation, lives near Chunghak-tong and occasionally visits to tend the graves.<17>

To the Six Loyal Ministers of Great Chosŏn, one commoner pays respects.
Looking up, I bow, visiting the four tombs;
As if words were present, my head bows naturally.

That time you rode the carts, barefoot and hair unbound,
That time blood was spilt on the white sands of Saenamt'ŏ,
How many springs and autumns of wind and rain, yet my heart trembles still.

After Nosan departed, did you even attend his spirit?
The resentment piercing the heavens, did you unfold it in the netherworld?<18>
Though a descendant of a hundred generations later, I clench my fists and tremble.

The great household of five hundred years has long since changed;
What use is asking about the old storms of four hundred years*?
Is it only certain that the one who gathered [your bodies] was Maewŏltang?

The green river flows long, weeping as if choked;
The bank is a thousand fathoms high, only reeds sway chaotically.
On a desolate mountain, moonlit night, what becomes of the six spirits?
Autumn, Ninth Month, Fourteenth day after the Double Ninth Festival, Kapsul Year.<19>

**Summary**

The article, written by "Wŏlt'an" in 1934, describes a visit to the tombs of the Six Martyred Ministers (Sayuksin) near Noryangjin, Seoul. It recounts the historical events leading to their martyrdom: the usurpation of the throne by Prince Suyang (King Sejo) from the young King Tanjong, the failed plot by the six loyal ministers (Sŏng Sam-mun, Pak P'aeng-nyŏn, Yi Kae, Ha Wi-ji, Yu Ŭng-bu, Yu Sŏng-wŏn) to restore Tanjong, their execution, and Tanjong's subsequent exile and death. The author discusses the confusion surrounding the number and identification of the tombs, citing historical records like the *Chibong Yusŏl* and *Yŏllyŏsil Kisul*, and describes the current state of the site, noting four marked graves and a fifth potential site. The piece concludes with a poem expressing sorrow and reverence for the ministers. From a colonial history perspective, the article is interesting as it reflects a continued veneration of Joseon Dynasty loyalists and a focus on Korean historical narratives during Japanese rule. The detailed recounting of Sejo's usurpation and the tragic fate of Tanjong and his supporters could serve as a subtle, perhaps nationalistic, reflection on themes of loyalty, betrayal, and suffering under unjust power, potentially resonating with contemporary colonial experiences.

이듬해 丁丑에 順興에 安置된 錦城大君 瑜는 府使 李甫欽으로 더부러 맛날 때마다 손을 잡고 눈물을 흘려 다시 魯山의 復位를 꾀하야 寧陽尉 鄭悰 (端宗 妹夫)과 漢南君 * (首陽 庶弟)와 永豐君 瑔(* 同腹弟 惠嬪 楊氏 出 朴彭年의 女婿)을 通하고 南中豪傑을 結托하야 順興의 군사를 出動식이고 檄文을 發하야 「天子以令諸侯하니 郭敢不從이리오」하야 將次 復辟의 運動을 일으켜 山河를 움지기려 할 때 順興府 及+唱과 錦城宮婢의 눈마짐이 大勢를 그르처 일을 綻露식이니 슬푸다. 首陽은 다시 또 한번 그 아우 錦城을 죽이고 瓔을 죽이고 *를 죽이고 瑔을 죽이고 庶母 (*瑔의 어머이요 端宗을 젓먹여 길은 惠嬪 梁氏를 죽이지 안이치 못하게 되엿스니 10月24日에 가서는 듸듸여 神人이 共怒할 萬苦의 큰 罪를 犯하야 禁府都事 王邦衍으로 藥을 밧쳐 魯山께 보내니 때에 春秋-겨우 17이라. 사람으로써 할 바이랴. 책을 덥고 붓을 멈춤이 可하다.
말끗은 다시 丙子로 옮아가 새남터에 六臣이 行刑을 당한 후에 梅月堂 金時習이 중의 모양으로 밤을 타 屍體를 업어 날러 南麓에 무더두고 드러내여 일홈을 表할 수 없음에 朴氏之墓 兪氏之墓 李氏之墓 成氏之墓라 하야 婦人의 무덤처럼 標石을 해 두엇다. 墓下道路邊에 별로히 碑碣이 잇스니 正祖대 李徽之가 王命을 바더 撰한 바이다. 그 碑文中에 『噫惟玆五墓旣表以朴兪李成姓氏 則其爲六臣中四公無疑又有一成氏此則成公之父勝同時被禍葬此云而河公墓在嶺南善山只藏一體柳公墓則擉不聞所在』라 하고＜16＞

새남터 白沙場에 피뿌리신 그때 일이
비바람 몃春秋완데 가슴사믓 설레오.

魯山 가오신 후 魂이라도 뫼시엿소.
하눌에 뻐치신 恨을 地府에나 펴보섯소＜18＞
百代의 後生이엿만 주먹쥐어 떱내다.

五百해 큰살림도 박귄지 오래거니
四百年 옛風波를 무러무삼 *오릿가
다만지 거두어준 이 梅月堂이 분명하오?
푸른江 길이 흘러 목메는듯 울음울고
언덕은 천길인데 갈때풀만 어지러위
山젹젹 달밝은 밤에 엇지하노 여섯혼.
歲甲戍秋九月重陽后旬四.＜19＞
＜14-19＞
