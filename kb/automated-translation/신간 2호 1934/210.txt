Christmas
						Yi Sŭngman

On Christmas night—

The son, whose father is a policeman (巡査), discovers his father arresting and taking away a thief and exclaims, "Father, why are you arresting Grandpa Santa Claus?!" (Drawing by Yi Sŭngman) <83>

**Summary**

This single-panel cartoon depicts a humorous scene on Christmas night. A young boy sees his policeman father arresting a thief and, mistaking the thief (perhaps carrying a sack) for Santa Claus, asks why his father is arresting Santa. The cartoon reflects the introduction and presence of Western Christmas traditions in 1930s Korea. For historians, it offers a glimpse into the period's cultural blend, showing how figures like Santa Claus were understood or misinterpreted. It also presents a mundane, domestic view of a colonial-era policeman (*sunsa*), contrasting the child's innocence with the realities of law enforcement and perhaps societal hardship (implied by the thief) during the colonial period.
