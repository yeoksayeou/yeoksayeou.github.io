Spy Anecdote

This is a short story that appeared in some foreign magazine, a tale about Gandhi (깐듸), who clarified [something ****]. The police, calling [something **], employed a native (土人) as a 'spy' and ordered him to investigate where Gandhi's (깐듸) movement funds were coming from.

A few days later, the 'spy' returned with the findings of his investigation, which were as follows:
'After finishing a speech anywhere, Gandhi (깐듸) calls several women from the crowd he investigated forward [to his front? 압*로]. Wondering what he was doing, I watched closely, and he asked, "You are wearing expensive earrings; why on earth do you go around wearing those?" At this, the women [somehow **], one by one, blushed and turned away to remove them [도라가 바리는데]. Later [나*에], looking into it [일어보닛가], Gandhi (깐듸) uses this as a means of [something **]; he sends the women away behind him and earns money by holding a hidden [가*?] auction (競賣). That's how he creates his movement funds.'

Hearing such [a thing? *은], the police officer was left speechless, his mouth agape. Thus, it was written that because Indian (印度) society is like this, there is still no possibility of revolution. I don't know if this is true, but whatever [何如*] the [case? ****기예], it's such a dumbfounding story that I introduce it here. <84>

**Summary**

This short article recounts an anecdote, allegedly from a foreign magazine, about how Mahatma Gandhi supposedly raised funds for his movement. A police spy reported that Gandhi would publicly question women about their expensive earrings after speeches, shaming them into removing them. He would then allegedly collect these earrings and sell them secretly via auction to fund his activities. The article concludes by citing the source's opinion that such methods indicate Indian society is not yet ready for revolution, while expressing disbelief about the story's veracity. From a historical perspective, the article is interesting as it reflects a cynical or perhaps propagandistic view of Gandhi's movement circulating internationally (and reported in colonial Korea), potentially aiming to undermine his moral authority by portraying his fundraising methods as manipulative and his followers as easily swayed. It also shows Korean periodicals' engagement with international affairs, albeit through second-hand, possibly unreliable accounts.
