The Sorrow of a Rented House
						Yi Sŭngman

Sorrow of a Rented House
In a rented house, even pounding rice cakes carelessly can lead to disgrace.

Sorrow of Boarding House Life
Because the next-door neighbor is pounding rice cakes, a sudden shock inside the room! <93>

**Summary**

This short cartoon caption by Yi Sŭngman humorously highlights the lack of privacy and the disturbances inherent in living in rented houses (setchip) and boarding houses (hasukchip) in 1930s Korea. The specific complaint revolves around the noise neighbors make when pounding rice cakes (ttŏk), a common activity, especially during holidays, causing embarrassment or sudden disruption. For historians, this piece offers a small glimpse into the everyday annoyances and crowded living conditions faced by urban dwellers, particularly renters and boarders, during the colonial period. It reflects social commentary on the constraints of non-homeownership and the close, often intrusive, proximity of neighbors.
