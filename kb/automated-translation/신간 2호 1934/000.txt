**Body Text Translation:**
Major Expansion of the Kaebyŏksa Sahwu System

The purpose of our Kaebyŏksa (開闢社) is not merely the publication and sale of ordinary magazines and books. To achieve a more substantial result under a more intimate connection between people who share the same aspirations, we established the Sahwu System (社友制, Friend of the Company System) in October 1920 (Year Imsul), the third anniversary of our founding. Seeking widely those with shared intentions throughout the world, for the past ten-plus years (十餘星霜), under the fervent support and backing of our Sahwu members both at home and abroad (海南外), the company's fortunes have progressed day by day, leading to the prosperous state we see today. Now, concurrently with the publication of *Kaebyŏk* (開闢), our company is further renewing and expanding this system. We dare to commemorate the prosperity of our company and express gratitude for the fraternal bonds (奸誼), while furthermore promising that this will become the sole institution through which the great achievements of our cultural movement are brought forth (齊來). Fortunately, if conscientious individuals everywhere respond to this, and under an extremely simple method, we harvest extremely substantial results, how could this solely benefit just the company regarding the Sahwu or the Sahwu regarding the company? Here, we earnestly present the details and dare to request the sympathetic endorsement of the generous and public-spirited (大方篤志).

Sahwu Regulations (社友規定)

Article 1: A Sahwu refers to a public-spirited person who agrees with the aims and objectives of this company and maintains an organic connection with the company.

Article 2: Regarding various issues arising on the surface (波面) of current society that are deemed major or special, a Sahwu may request investigation or means of resolution regarding these from the company. Upon receiving such a request, the company will consider the degree and nature of the issue and respond to the request as far as possible (可及).

Article 3: Sahwu within the same region (for example, one Prefecture (府) or County (郡)) may, with the joint signatures of twenty-eight or more Sahwu, request speeches or lectures on special issues of that region from the company. Upon receiving such a request, the company will respond directly (直히).

Article 4: The company will present the *Kaebyŏk* magazine or other magazines to Sahwu, and additionally provide all other publications related to the company's publishing activities at cost (實費).

Article 5: Sahwu possess the basic qualification to become employees of the company headquarters or its branches/sub-branches (支分社).
Note (備考). This is because there is a clause (條頃) in the company regulations stating that company employees shall be selected from among the Sahwu.

Article 6: When a Sahwu encounters unforeseen disasters (不時에 災變), the company will provide appropriate aid and comfort (慰助). Furthermore, in cases where a Sahwu's human rights are violated (蹂躪), the company will devise (講究) appropriate protective measures (擁護策).

Article 7: As a sign of agreement with the company's aims and objectives, Sahwu shall contribute (出損) ten Won (圓) annually.
However, those who contribute a lump sum of one hundred Won or more shall be permanently exempted from the annual ten Won support contribution.

Article 8: Sahwu shall present or provide to the company... [text seems incomplete or potentially requires interpretation of 陳示]

Article 11: Sahwu shall, as far as possible, at any time, strive for the benefit (便益) of Sahwu and respect their honor (名譽). [Note: Article 11 seems identical to Article 10]

**Summary**

This article announces a significant expansion of the Kaebyŏksa Sahwu (Friend of the Company) system in 1934, building upon its establishment in 1920. It portrays the Sahwu system not just as a subscription or support model but as a core part of Kaebyŏksa's mission to foster a cultural movement based on "pan-human nationalism." The regulations detail the mutual obligations: Sahwu provide financial support (10 Won annually or a 100 Won lifetime contribution) and local information, while Kaebyŏksa offers publications at cost, investigates social issues upon request, provides lectures, offers aid in disasters, defends members' rights, and preferentially hires Sahwu as employees. The included company regulations outline Kaebyŏksa's structure and broad cultural-nationalist objectives. For historians, this document is valuable as it illustrates how a prominent Korean cultural organization during the colonial period structured its supporter network, blending commercial aspects (magazine sales) with socio-political aims ("pan-human nationalism," cultural movement, mutual aid, rights defense). The emphasis on organic connection, mutual support, and the pathway from supporter (Sahwu) to employee (社員) highlights an attempt to build a cohesive and committed organization extending beyond mere publishing under colonial constraints.
