Musings from the School Window
						Yi Tong-wŏn
-Preface omitted- I myself know better than anyone that I am not originally the kind of author suited to creating something akin to educational criticism. However, I am not a complete outsider to the world of education, as I face several hundred students daily. Therefore, even if I have opinions, criticisms, or admiration regarding this educational work, it probably wouldn't be too presumptuous.
A sense of self-importance, unacknowledged by the world, seems to arise.
It is a fact beyond fact that when there are multiple identical items, distinctions of good or bad, superior or inferior, and grades emerge. Similarly, numerous organizations called schools are scattered within the same era and the same observational scope, so it is inevitable that distinctions of superiority and inferiority arise. When a certain ordinary school gains public praise for being good, it's not entirely because the principal is a man of virtue or the teachers are knowledgeable. It's because many of its graduates enter higher ordinary schools. Likewise, a certain higher ordinary school is considered good because many of its graduates enter professional schools and universities. And a certain professional school or university is considered good for the simple, if simple, reason that its graduates find employment easily. This is just like how a certain store becomes famous not because of the store's architecture or the character of the shop owner, but simply because it sells the same goods cheaper than elsewhere. Looking at it this way, from ordinary school all the way to university, everything ultimately boils down to the single pursuit of securing a salaried position. Of course, the grand statement that humans eat to live is made by only one or two in ten thousand; beyond that, everyone lives a life that frankly confesses they live to eat.<34> Thus, it is not strange at all that modern education, from beginning to end, revolves around the magnet of a monthly salary. Consequently, the fact that in recent times, among middle school graduates applying to higher-level schools, applicants to medical schools are overwhelmingly numerous speaks to the fact that one must eat. It is fortunate that entrance exams to medical schools are difficult; if admission were without exams, Korea would surely have faced a great flood of doctors, and at the same time, for the first time since the founding of Korea, disease might have been fundamentally eradicated.
And so, school becomes nothing more than a gateway leading to the highest glory of a monthly salary. There is no need to be deeply concerned with a gateway whose purpose from the start is merely passage, and the education that works within that gateway for those passing through also becomes of little concern. Ultimately, there is a sense that it has transformed into a study focused solely on scoring points. For instance, if all schools were to abolish examinations entirely, from entrance exams to final graduation exams, one wonders how many graduates there would be who wouldn't even know the titles of the books they studied.

In times past, if there was a famous teacher, young scholars would travel even a thousand *li*, carrying their provisions, to study under him. In those times, the bond between teacher and student (師弟之誼) was said to be greater than that between father and son. Nowadays, however, students are loaded onto trains heading towards the gateway called school to pass through. They barely find out the names of the principal and teachers by looking at the rulebook, and in severe cases, even after more than a year since enrollment, they do not know who the principal and teachers are. Where can the warm affection between teacher and student arise from? This is not just the students' situation; looking from the principal's perspective, it is likely no different from the students' side. Thus, seeking human warmth between teacher and student in such educational work is like seeking fish from a tree (椽木求魚). Yet, considering what connects such schools and students reveals something even colder mediating between them: namely, money (돈). Of course, who doesn't know that schools are not profit-making institutions (營利機關)? However, strangely enough, even though schools are not profit-making institutions, actions are carried out that fundamentally resemble those of profit-making institutions, enough to be misunderstood as profit-seeking activities. Naturally, one cannot enroll without paying the entrance fee, but even while enrolled, one inevitably faces expulsion if tuition fees are not paid. While this might be considered perfectly natural, suspending students even for temporary delinquency in tuition payments gives students the impression of exchanging money for schooling or buying knowledge with money. If only schools could settle monetary matters concerning tuition directly with the students' parents/guardians (學父兄), perhaps the sorrow of being unable to attend school today due to lack of money could be eliminated. Also, I entertain the idle thought that when honoring top students, rather than exempting tuition, it might be better to collect the tuition as usual and give them school supplies or books of equivalent value. Therefore, rewards and punishments (賞罰) are absolutely necessary for the smooth operation of group life. Even in the extremely intimate group of a small family, rewards and punishments are necessary,<35> so how much more necessary must they be in the considerably large group entity of a school? Of course, it's not particularly rare for a school to give awards to students, so it doesn't get reported publicly unless it's unusual. However, incidents related to punishment, such as student beatings (學生毆打事件), often provide considerable material for the third page of newspapers and sometimes even lead to court cases (法廷沙汰). No matter how much the teacher-student bond (師弟之誼) has vanished today, everyone feels that this is unseemly. At this point, I think the *tatbal* (撻罰 - flogging) from the old *sŏdang* (書堂 - traditional village school) style education was the wisest method of punishment. Hitting the head (頭腦部) might be considered crude/unsound (非術生的), but *tatbal* fully achieves the purpose of punishment without causing serious injury (傷害) to the person punished or being crude/unsound in the slightest. Of course, *tatbal* does not exist in present-day schools. Does this mean there is no hitting at all? That is not the case. Human actions are largely the same throughout history, so hitting still exists. For example, when a student commits a fault deserving only a verbal reprimand (言責), hitting may occur as a product of emotion (感情). Sometimes this goes too far and creates newspaper material. Since this is the reality, perhaps reviving *tatbal* would be inheriting the wisdom of our ancestors.
Lastly, I wish to offer my opinion regarding school athletics (學校運動). People often confuse sports (스포-츠) and exercise (運動), superficially concluding that the foreign word "sports" is simply exercise, different words with the same meaning and purpose. Although I certainly do not present myself as a sportsman or a researcher of sports, I mention this simply because I understand that sports and exercise are not the same. Sports focus on running, jumping, and throwing, striving through great hardship (千辛萬苦) to reduce time or increase distance by inches. A hundred-meter runner, for instance, undergoes unimaginable pains (苦心) through years of accumulated effort (積功) to shave off a second or even one-fifth of a second. However, reducing time by a second or a fifth of a second does not make the athlete's body any healthier; it is easy to reach overexertion (過勞). But since victory is the highest goal, they sacrifice (犧牲) their own health to win the laurel wreath (月桂冠). Exercise (運動), however, is fundamentally based on health and is done for the sake of health. The various activities conducted in schools—baseball, tennis, soccer, basketball, volleyball, track and field (陸上競技), swimming (水上競技), skating (氷上競技), etc.—are sports. They prioritize victory over considering the health status of the athletes. Therefore, students who become sports athletes, or the parents/guardians who have such athletes, need to deeply consider studies, health, and exercise and provide guidance accordingly.
Lately, I observe this situation. Was the sports athlete originally a weak person who chose a certain sport to become healthy? And how much healthier did they become through that sport? Or was the athlete originally strong and physically superior, thus taking up sports? Anyone considering this should be able to discern which is more likely.<36>
Therefore, does the original intention of school exercise, which started to strengthen students' bodies, align with the purpose of sports, which is to train athletes? Does it or does it not? Some people even go so far as to say this: Being good at sports is good advertising for a student. Look at what makes such-and-such school famous.
However, if this is called good advertising, it seems rather clumsy advertising with inverted (顚倒) priorities. Aren't the athletes used for this advertising sacrificing a portion of their studies and several pounds (멧파운드) of their health for the school's advertisement?

**Summary**

The author, Yi Tong-wŏn, writing in 1934, critiques the colonial Korean education system for being overly focused on producing graduates solely for securing high-paying jobs (symbolized by the pursuit of medical school), rather than genuine learning or character development. He laments the erosion of the traditional teacher-student bond, replaced by a cold, transactional relationship mediated by tuition fees. Yi criticizes the emphasis on exams ("point-scoring study") and corporal punishment, suggesting the traditional *tatbal* (flogging) might be preferable to impulsive hitting. Finally, he distinguishes between "sports" (competitive, record-driven, potentially harmful) and "exercise" (health-focused), arguing schools misuse students' athletic talents for institutional prestige ("advertising") at the expense of their health and studies.

From a historical perspective, the article offers insight into the anxieties and critiques surrounding the modern, Japanese-influenced education system implemented in colonial Korea. It highlights the tension between traditional values (like the teacher-student relationship, *saje chi ŭi*) and the perceived materialism and utilitarianism of the new system focused on credentials and employment within the colonial structure. The specific mention of medical school popularity reflects economic realities and aspirations. The discussion on corporal punishment and the preference for *tatbal* reveals ongoing debates about disciplinary methods, contrasting traditional Korean practices with potentially cruder modern ones. The critique of "sports" as institutional advertising rather than genuine student development points to the co-option of modern activities for colonial-era institutional goals. Historians might find the text valuable for understanding contemporary perceptions of educational purpose, social mobility, cultural change, and the impact of modernization under colonial rule.

						李東園
-前畧- 나는 元來爲人이 敎育批判에 頹似한 것을 創造할 作者가안인줄은 누구보다 내 自身이 잘아는바이다 그러나 敎育界에 純然한 門外漢은 안이고 每日數百名의 學生을 對面함이니 이 敎育工作에 對하야 或意見, 或批判, 或感服이 잇다하더라도 그다지외람치는 안을것같다.
世上이 許諾치안는 自矜이 생기는 것같다
同一한 物件이 여럿이잇스면 好不好優劣等級이 出生하는 것은 事實以上의 事實이어니와 學校라는 組織體도 同時代에 同一한 觀測範圍內에 數多하게 散在하얐으니 優劣等級이 不可不生起는 것인대 某某普通學校가 좃타고 世人의 稱頌에 오르는 것은 校長이 德望家라던지 敎師가 學識이 豊富하다는 것은 全然히안이고 그 學校卒業生이 高等普通學校에 入學을 만이 한다는것이고 某某高等普通學校가좃타는것도 그 學校卒業生이 專門學校와 大學校에 入學者가 많다는것이며 某某專門學校大學校가 좃타는 것은 그 學校卒業生이 就業을 잘한다는 單純하다면 單純한 理由가하나인데 마치 某商店이 有名하다면 商店建築이나 店主商人如何는 問題삼을 것도 업고 같은 物件을 다른데보다 安價로판다는 理由 그것과꼭갓다 그리고 본즉 普通學校, 大學校지에 明給자리엇어간다는 한가지에 歸着하고만다 勿論人間은 살기 爲해서 먹는다는 것은 萬人千萬人中에 一二人이나 하는 壯談이고 其外에는 모두가 먹기 爲해서 산다는 것을 如實히 告白하는 生活이 닛＜34＞가 現代敎育이 自初至終으로 月給이라는 磁石에 붙어단니는 것은 何等異常한것도업다 그럼으로 近來에 이르러서 中等學校卒業生이 上級學校志願者數로 보더라도 醫學校志願者가 斷然히 多數인 것은 먹어야하겟다는 事實을 말하는 것이며 醫學校에서 入學試驗이 어렵기가 多幸이지 萬若無試驗入學이나식이엿드면 朝鮮에는 그만 醫師大洪水가 터지고 말것이니 同時에 朝鮮이 創設以後에 처음으로 病이라고는 根本的으로 退治할번하얏다
그리고 學校라는 것은 月給이라는 最高光榮으로 드러가는 關門에지내지못함이니 當初부터 通過를 目的하는 關門을 깁히 相關할것도업고 그 關門에서 通過人을 爲하야 工作하는 敎育 그것도 그다지 關心치안케되야 畢竟은 點取學文으로 變體한 感이잇다 假令 모든 學校에서 試驗이라는 것 入學試驗부터 最後卒業試驗까지 全廢한다고 하면 무슨 冊을 工夫하는지 冊이름도 모르는 卒業生이 그얼마나 만을지 모를가 한다』
往昔과갓치 有名한 先生이잇다면 靑年學徒가 千里길이라도 糧食을 지고 그 門下에갓섯스니 그 時는 師弟之誼가 父子보다더하다고 일너왓스나 現今은 學校라는 關門을 向하야 汽車에 실려서 通過하게되며 校長이나 先生의 姓名을 規則書를 보고야 누구인지를 간신히 알아보고 甚하면 入學한 後一年이넘어도 校長과 先生이 誰某를 알지못함이니 師弟의 溫情이 어대서 生할것인가 이것은 學生便만이 이런 것이 안이고 校長便으로보더라도 亦是 學生便그것에 러지지 안을터이니 이런 敎育工作에서 人間的情味를 그 師弟之間에서 求하기는 椽木求魚라고 할 것이다 그런대이런 學校와 學生이 그 무엇으로 聯結을 짓고잇는가를 一考하면 더욱 冷情한 것하나이 그 中間에 介在하엿스니 卽돈이다 勿論學校가 營利機關이 아닌 것이야 누가 모를 것인가 그런대 異常스럽게도 營利機關이안인 學校이면서도 根本的으로 營利機關에 떠러지지안케 營利行事라고 誤解를 밧으리만한 것이 行하야진다 勿論入學金을 못내면 入學도못하지만 在學中에라도 授業料를 못내면 退學이 될수밧게업다 이런것이야 當然中當然하다고 하겟지만 在學中間에 臨時授業料滯納으로도 停學이되게하는 것은 金錢과 學校交換이라던지 金錢으로 學文買賣한다는 感을 學生에게 이리킬가하는 感이잇스니 萬若學校로써 授業料에 關한 金錢件은 學父兄과 直接交涉으로 淸算을 할수잇스면 今日은 돈이업서서 學校에 못간다는 悲哀를 업시할 수가 잇지안이할가 생각하고 는 優等生表彰에도 授業料免除를 그만두고 授業料는 그대로 밧으며 그만한 金額의 學用品이나 書籍으로 주는 것이 더좃치 안을가하는 空想을 하야본다 그럼으로 賞罰이라는 것은 集團生活을 圓滑하게 營爲하는데 絶對必要의 한가지일것인데 小規模의 家庭이라는 極히 親密한 集團에서도 賞罰이 必要하거＜35＞던 况且적지안은 集團體의 學校에서야 勿論賞罰의 必要는 말할바안일터이나 어떤 學校에서 學生에게 賞을주는것이야 그다지 稀有之事가안이면 世間에 發表되지안치만 或罰에 關하야 學生毆打事件이라고하야서 新聞三面에 相當한 材料가 되고 或은 法廷沙汰지 傳하는 것은 아모리 師弟之誼가 沒却된 今日이라도 아름답지 못한줄을 누구나다갓치 늣길 것이다 여긔에 이르러 以前書堂式敎育에서 韃罰이라는 것은 가장 賢明한 處罰方法이라고 생각한다 頭腦部를 리는 것은 非術生的이라하겟지만 韃罰만은 罰의 目的은 完全히 達하고 被罰者에게 重한 傷害라던지 非術生的은 조금도업다. 現今學校에서는 勿論韃罰이라는것이업스니 따리는 것이 全然히업느냐하면 그런것이안이고 人間의 行事는 古今이거진갓흐니만치 亦是따리는 것은 업지안타 假令 어떤 學生이 言責에 지내가는 過失을 犯하는때에는 自然히 感情의 所産으로 따리게되면 或時程度에 지내처서 新聞材料를 만들게 되는 것인즉 事實이 如斯할진대 차라리 韃罰를 復活식이는 것이 古人의 賢明을 繼承하는 것인듯하다.
來終으로 學校運動에 關하야 意見을 말하고저하거니와 世間에서는 往往히 스포-츠와 運動히 混同하야서 外來語 스포-츠 卽 運動, 異語同意이며 目的이 同一하다고 皮相的論議에 始終하는바인데 내가 무슨 스포츠맨이라던지 스포-츠 硏究者로라고 決코 自處하지안치만 다만 스포-츠와 運動의 同一치안은줄아나만은 짐작함으로 이여말함이다 스포-츠라는 것은 競走跳躍 投擲中타임으로주리고 尺數寸數를 느리려고 千辛萬苦를 하는 것인대 百米突選手가 一秒乃至五分之一秒를 주리려고 數年동안 積功을 느리려고, 얼마나 練習을 하는지 想像以外에 苦心을 하고잇다 그러나 一秒나 一秒五分之의 타임을 주린다고 그 選手의 身體는 조금더 健康해지지안으며 過勞에이르기 쉬울것이지만 다만 優勝이 最高目的임으로 月桂冠을 取하야 自己健康을 犧牲하는 것이다 그러나 運動이라고하면 健康을 根抵로 삼고 健康하기 爲하는 것이 運動이며 學園에서 行하는 各種運動野球, 庭球蹴球, 籠球, 排球, 陸上競技 水上競技, 氷上競技等諸種은 스포-츠인데 그 選手의 健康狀態를 考慮하기보다 優勝이 目標이니 그럼으로 스포-츠 選手가되는 學生이던지 그 選手를 가지고 잇는 學父兄은 工夫, 健康, 運動을 깁히 考慮하야 指導할 必要가잇다.
나는 近來에 이런 現狀을 바라본다 스포-츠 選手가 元來는 身體가 弱하든사람이 健康하기 爲하야 어 스포-츠를 擇하얏스며 는 그스포-츠로 얼마나 身體가 健康하야젓는지 또는 그 選手가 本來身體가 健强하고 體力이 優秀하야서 스포-츠를 하는 것인지 누구나 이것을 생각해볼때에는 그어떤 것을 넉넉히 斟酌할수잇지안을가＜36＞
그런즉 學園運動이 學生의 身體를 强하게하기 爲하야 出發한 그 本意가 스포-츠로 選手를 養成하는 그것과 目的이 서로 符合하는가 안이하는가 甚至於이런말까지하는 사람이잇다 運動을 잘하는 것은 學生의 조흔 廣告다 某某學校가 무엇으로 일홈이잇는 것을 보라
그러나 이것을 조흔 廣告라고 한다면 좀 目的이 顚倒되는 拙劣한 廣告라고 할터이고 이 廣告에 利用되는 選手는 自己의 工夫一部 健康멧파운드를 學校廣告에 바치는 것이안인가
