**Body Text Translation:**
Grand View of Hamnam Counties, Chŏngp'yŏng County between the Two Hŭngs

Lying horizontally like a leaf between the two Hŭngs—Hamhŭng and Yŏnghŭng—is Chŏngp'yŏng County (定平郡), short from east to west and long from north to south. The county's old names were Kopaji (古巴只), Sŏnwi (宣威), or Chung-san (仲山). During the reign of King Chŏngjong (靖宗) of Koryŏ, a fortress was built on Mt. Pibaek (鼻白山), a gate (關門) was established, and the name was changed to Chŏngju (定州), stationing a P<em>angŏsa</em> (防禦使; Defense Commander). In the 5th year of King Kongmin (恭愍王), it was elevated to a Tohobubu (都護府; Protectorate General). In the 5th year of King T'aejong (太宗) of the Yi Dynasty (李朝), to avoid having the same name as Chŏngju (定州) in P'yŏngan Province (平安道), it was renamed Chŏngp'yŏng (定平), which continues to this day. It faces the sea (海) to the east, borders Yŏnghŭng County (永興郡) and Nyŏngwŏn County (寧遠郡) of South P'yŏngan (平南) to the west, Yŏnghŭng County to the south, and Hamhŭng County (咸興郡) to the north. The total number of households in the county is 12,504, with a population of 73,204, of which 72 households and 217 people are Japanese. The county seat (읍) is located about 10 *ri* north of Chŏngp'yŏng Station, in a valley with Mt. Pibaek behind it and Mt. Nam (南山) in front. Various government offices and school facilities are present, the streets are relatively neat and clean (淸楚), and the market is especially bustling on market days, held on the 4th and 9th days of the lunar month. Furthermore, Sin-sang Station (新上驛) in Ch'ullyu-myŏn (春柳面) occupies a pivotal location (樞要) in the Kŭmjin River (金津江) basin and has long been called P'ach'un-jang (播春場), a major market. Now, with the opening of the Hamgyŏng Line (咸鏡線), it has become the sole important place in this county. That is, of the 604,157 *won* annual transaction value of the four markets within the county, this P'ach'un-jang accounts for 368,000 *won*, and consequently, most of the county's important goods are shipped out (移出) via this station. The cultivated land area for farming households in this county is 7,623 *chŏng* (町) of paddy fields (畓) and 21,890 *chŏng* 9 *tan* (反) of dry fields (田). Bordering the Hamhŭng Plain (함흥평야), the land is fertile, the climate is mild, and irrigation is convenient, making it suitable (適宜) for agriculture. The main agricultural products, starting with (爲始) rice with an annual production of over 60,000 *sŏk* and soybeans over 13,000 *sŏk*, reach an annual harvest value (수획고) of 400,000 *won*. Minerals are extremely abundant, with 20 mining areas (광구) for gold, silver, copper, lead, placer gold, graphite, coal, kaolin, etc. Mining (채굴) was once prosperous, making it renowned (저명하엿더니) as a mining region in South Hamgyŏng (咸南), but the aftermath (여파) of the Great War in Europe (歐洲大戰) reached (及하야) even here, and currently, all mines are in a state of suspension. Other than that, fisheries amount to over 27,000 *won*, livestock includes over 10,000 cattle (牛) and over 4,000 pigs (豚), and sericulture (蠶業) amounts to over 12,000 *won*. It can be said (可謂하겟다) that the abundance of products yields nothing (不讓한다) to other counties in South Hamgyŏng. The people's temperament, customs, and language are mostly the same (갓고) as the rest of South Hamgyŏng, with nothing particularly special. However, seeing that (보면) there is (잇는) a proverb "Chŏngp'yŏng kkadurŏgi (定平까드럭이)," one can also infer (推知하겟다) what <79> their disposition might be like. Among the young figures, Messrs. Wŏn Chŏng-jun (元貞俊), Chang Se-hwan (張世煥), Chin Pyŏng-hwan (秦柄瓛), Kim Che-ŭn (金濟殷) in the county seat, and Yi Hyŏn-t'ae (李鉉台) at Sin-sang Station are striving greatly in all matters (凡事에). As for famous spots, Hwa-do (花島) in Sŏndŏk-myŏn (宣德面) at the mouth of Hamhŭng Bay (咸興灣口) is, as its name suggests, exceptionally scenic (景槪絶勝하며) (this island was originally Hamhŭng territory (咸興地) but was recently transferred (移屬되얏는데); the island has about 60 households). Regarding historical sites (고적), the Old Long Wall on Mt. Pibaek north of the county seat, built (所築) by King Chŏngjong of Koryŏ, and Changju Fortress (長州城) in Sŏsŏng-ri (西城里), Changgyŏng-myŏn (長京面), south of the county, built by King Hyŏnjong (顯宗) of Koryŏ, are the most famous (최저명하나), but both are dilapidated and ruined (황폐 壞敗하고), with only (僅히) their foundations remaining, evoking feelings for the past (感古의 懷) amidst the autumn wind and falling leaves.

**Summary**

The article provides a detailed overview of Chŏngp'yŏng County in South Hamgyŏng Province in 1924. It describes its geography (location between Hamhŭng and Yŏnghŭng, bordering the sea), history (name changes from Koryŏ to Yi Dynasty), demographics (population over 73,000, including 217 Japanese residents), administrative center, and economy. The county boasts fertile land suitable for agriculture (rice, soybeans), significant mineral resources (though mining is currently suspended due to the aftermath of WWI), fisheries, livestock, and sericulture. Sin-sang Station on the Hamgyŏng Line is highlighted as a crucial economic hub. The article also mentions notable young local figures, scenic spot Hwa-do, and dilapidated historical fortresses. A local proverb, "Chŏngp'yŏng kkadurŏgi," hints at the perceived local character. For historians, the article offers insights into the colonial Korean economy, detailing agricultural output, the impact of global events (WWI) on local industry (mining suspension), infrastructure development (railway's role), the presence of Japanese settlers, and administrative history. The mention of the specific proverb provides a glimpse into regional stereotypes or perceptions during that era.

기사형태	소식

咸南列邑大觀, 間於兩興定平郡
咸興, 永興 兩興間에 葉狀형으로 횡재하야 동서가 短하고 남북이 長한 군은 定平郡이엿다. 본군의 古號는 古巴只, 宣威, 혹은 仲山이니 고려 靖宗 時에 鼻白山에 성을 築하야 關門을 設하고 定州라고 改稱하야 防禦使를 置하얏다가 恭愍王 5년에 陞하야 都護府를 삼고 李朝 太宗 5년에 平安道의 定州와 同名인 것을 忌하야 定平이라 改한 후 금일에까지 至하얏다. 동은 海을 臨하고 서는 永興郡과 平南 寧遠郡을 접하고 남은 永興郡, 북은 咸興郡을 界하얏다. 全郡의 호수는 12,504호, 인구는 73,204인이니, 其 중 일본인은 72호, 217인이다. 읍은 定平역 북10里許에 在하야 背에 鼻白山을 負하고 前에 南山을 控한 일개 谷地니 예의 각 관공서, 학교의 시설이 잇고 시가가 비교적 淸楚하며 특히 음력 4, 9일의 開市일에는 시황이 매우 왕성하다. 또 春柳面의 新上驛은 金津江 유역의 樞要위치를 점하야 고래로 播春場이라 칭하던 대시장이니 今에 咸鏡線 개통에 의하야 本郡 유일의 중요지가 되얏다. 즉 군내 4개소 시장의 取引年額이 604,157원 중 此 播春場의 取引年額이 368,000원을 점하고 從하야 全郡의 중요물이 대개 此驛으로 移出된다. 本郡의 농가 경작면적은 畓 7,623町, 田 21,890정 9反이니 함흥평야를 접하야 토지가 비옥하고 기후가 온화하며 且 수리가 편하야 농작에 適宜하다. 주요농산물은 米가 년산액 6만여 석, 大豆 1만3천여 석을 爲始하야 년수획고가 40만여원에 달하고 광물은 극히 풍부하야 금, 은, 동, 鉛, 砂金, 흑연, 석탄, 고령토 등 광구가 20구에 달하는데 一時 채굴이 성하야 咸南 광업지로 저명하엿더니 歐洲大戰의 여파는 此地에까지 及하야 현재 각 鑛이 다 휴업상태에 在하고 其외 수산 2만7천여 원, 축산으로는 牛 1만여 두, 豚 4천 여두 蠶業으로는 1만2천여 원에 달하니 산물의 풍부는 咸南 타군에 不讓한다 可謂하겟다. 인정 풍속 언어는 대개가 咸南과 갓고 별로 특별한 者가 無하나 속담에 「定平까드럭이」라는 말이 잇는 것을 보면 其 인심이 如何한 것을＜79＞ 또한 推知하겟다. 청년인물로는 읍내의 元貞俊, 張世煥, 秦柄瓛, 金濟殷, 新上驛의 李鉉台 등 諸君이 잇서 凡事에 매우 노력하고 명소로는 咸興灣口에 잇는 宣德面의 花島가 이름과 가티 景槪絶勝하며 (此 島는 본 咸興地로 근년에 移屬되얏는데 島內戶口 약 60여 호) 고적으로는 邑北 鼻白山에 잇는 高麗 靖宗의 所築 古長城과 郡南 長京面 西城里에 잇는 高麗 顯宗 所築 長州城이 최저명하나 다 황폐 壞敗하고 僅히 유지만 잔존하야 秋風落木에 感古의 懷를 起할 뿐이다.
