**Summary**

This article from the December 1, 1924 issue of *Kaebyŏk* magazine, authored and illustrated by An Sŏk-chu, is a cartoon feature titled "Twenty-Four Major Events of the Gapja Year." It likely visually depicted significant occurrences from the year 1924 (the Gapja year in the traditional East Asian sixty-year cycle) across pages 26 to 31. For historians, this piece is valuable as a contemporary visual commentary on events deemed significant in Korea during the colonial period, offering insights into public perception, cultural commentary, and the specific incidents An Sŏk-chu chose to highlight in that turbulent year. The use of the cartoon format itself reflects a medium for disseminating information and potentially critique during that era.
