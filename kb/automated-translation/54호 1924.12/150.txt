It is said that Yi Ki-hong (李起鴻), the head of Konyang-myŏn in Sach'ŏn-gun, residing in the position of the current village head, has lost impartiality in village governance due to personal feelings and frequently abuses his authority out of private resentment (私嫌) to persecute the people. In today's situation in Chosŏn, how could it be that Village Head Yi Ki-hong of Konyang<69> is the only one abusing his authority and troubling innocent, good people? Externally, political power has been stolen, and internally, economic ruin has been suffered. Are the Chosŏn people not in a state utterly without benefit, like a severely weakened person after illness, anxiously greeting day and night while perhaps hoping for a recovery? Despite this, being a village head of the same blood, a fellow Chosŏn person, and furthermore abusing authority for private resentment (私嫌) while disregarding and persecuting the people – what kind of heart is this? Sir, if even a little God-given conscience remains in you, I hope you will reflect and introspect. Like killing a chicken and presenting a duck's foot [to feign innocence], you are a transmitter of the Governor-General's rule, which merely puts up signboards claiming 'cultural rule' promotes the people's welfare, but as the ruler of the village residents, your conscience must surely forbid you from thinking it right to scheme against the governed people out of private resentment. This is not solely to point out your evil deeds, but rather a warning for the future regarding us, the governed people, and at the same time, advice for you, whose future path is long. If you awaken to this yourself, it would be the greatest fortune; if you deny it, I will provide an example below.

Sir, if you possess the fundamental nature of a human being, you should perhaps remember [your actions]? If so, how could you not fear the eyes of Heaven (天眼)? Even for national taxes (國稅), such actions would be improper. The school expansion cost (學校 增築費) is a duty tied to each individual person, so one should urge the people's self-awareness to the utmost. Moreover, regarding the 57 wŏn contribution assigned to Mr. Pak out of the 5,400 wŏn for the Konyang Public Elementary School expansion, wasn't his refusal not unreasonable? Given that Konyang has villages far apart making school attendance impossible, and that the Kaho Lecture Society (佳湖講習會), located in his own village, which has been managed for several years after receiving official permission, is currently facing difficulties in its maintenance – wasn't it a reasonable justification and condition to offer 37 wŏn of the aforementioned 57 wŏn to the lecture society and 20 wŏn to the village school? Furthermore, didn't you yourself state during the previous expansion fundraising general meeting that since there was a surplus of 400 wŏn beyond the 5,000 wŏn budget, this surplus would be used to subsidize the Kaho Lecture Society? And now, you feign ignorance, send people after midnight to disturb [Mr. Pak's] peaceful sleep, demand the school fees, and persecute him by demanding he catch chickens and bring cooked rice. When this failed, you arbitrarily summoned him twice. When that too was unsuccessful, accompanied by the village clerk (面書記) and officials (有司), you went out at dawn under the pretext of investigating unlicensed private tobacco cultivators (無牌自家用煙草耕作者調査) and uncovering those exceeding the allotted acreage (坪數超過者). Among the two unlicensed and seven exceeding cultivators discovered, you inwardly rejoiced that Mr. Pak was caught. Subsequently, summoning all of them to the village office, you granted a special favor (恩典) of forgiveness to all except the eight, yet uniquely targeted only Mr. Pak. Furthermore, you reported his violation of 2 p'yŏng as 16 p'yŏng. When county officials investigated, it was determined to be 2 p'yŏng, resulting in a fine (科料) of 5 wŏn. Unable to bear the indignation, Mr. Pak explained the true sequence of events to the county authorities and immediately moved to Yusuri, Naedong-myŏn, Chinju-gun. When he tried to obtain a copy of his family register (戶籍謄本), you boldly refused twice under the pretext that he had ignored summons. When he appeared in person on September 28th, you refused again similarly, only finally agreeing after persuasion from bystanders, yet to this day, there has been no news whatsoever, has there? Sir, does it seem that your duty as the current village head has revealed nothing other than plotting against the people to settle private grudges? The principles of Heaven (天理) are not indifferent; what did you gain from your recent actions, reporting a 2-p'yŏng violation as 16 p'yŏng to scheme against Mr. Pak? Never mind public opinion, how much has your base conduct been exposed? Sir! For your sake, I offer this phrase: "What goes out from you will return to you (出乎爾者反乎爾)."<70>

**Summary**

This article from 1924, written by "Chinju-saeng" (a person from Chinju), is a scathing critique of Yi Ki-hong, the head (myŏnjang) of Konyang-myŏn in Sach'ŏn-gun. The author accuses Yi of abusing his official power out of personal resentment to persecute villagers, particularly citing the case of a Mr. Pak. Yi allegedly harassed Pak over school expansion fees, retaliated against Pak's reasonable proposal to split the donation with a local lecture society (Kaho Lecture Society), and then falsely accused Pak of a significant tobacco cultivation violation, leading to a fine. Yi further obstructed Pak's attempt to move his family register after Pak relocated due to the harassment. The author appeals to Yi's conscience and warns him of karmic retribution, invoking a quote from Mencius.

For historians, this article offers a valuable glimpse into local administration and social tensions within Korean society under Japanese colonial rule. It highlights the potential for abuse of power by Korean officials appointed or recognized by the colonial authorities, demonstrating that grievances were not solely directed at the Japanese but also at fellow Koreans perceived as collaborators or petty tyrants. The conflict over school funds versus support for a local, possibly more traditional or community-based, lecture society (講習會) also points to complexities in navigating education and cultural maintenance during this period. The detailed account of harassment methods (midnight visits, false accusations, bureaucratic obstruction) provides concrete examples of everyday oppression.

泗川郡 昆陽面長 李起鴻군은 현직면장의 位에 在하야 面治上失公偏感하야 私嫌으로 직권을 남용하야써 인민을 박해하는 事가 頗多하다한다. 오날의 조선형편에 직권을 남용하야 무고한 양민을 苦勞히 구는 자가 엇지＜69＞ 昆陽 면장 李起鴻 뿐이랴만은 外로 정치적 勢權을 빼앗기고 내로 경제적 파멸을 당한지라 重* 후의 허약자가 행혀 回春을 기대하면서 奠日夜를 불안 중에셔 迎送하는 거와 小毫無益한 처지의 조선인이 안인가. 如斯함에도 불구하고 同血同族인 조선인 면장으로서 加之私*으로서 직권을 남용하야가며 인민을 무시 박해함은 抑何心腸인가 君아 만일 君에게도 天賦의 양심이 조곰이라도 남어 잇거든 再思自省함을 바란다. 닭 잡아먹고 오리발 내밀듯 인민의 복리증진이 문화적 통치이니 하는 標榜와 간뿐인 총독정치의 傳受者인 君인이지만 면민의 治者로서 私嫌으로 被治者인 인민을 謀害함이 宜當타고는 양심이 爲先 不許하리라. 이것이 君의 악행만을 指摘코저 함이 안이라 被治者인 우리 인민에 대한 後를 戒함인 동시에 前程이 구만리인 君을 위하야의 충고이다. 이에 대하야 君이 自悟하면 幸中 多幸이오, 만약 부인한다면 下에 一例를 擧하야 두겟노라.
君아, 君도 인류의 본성을 가진 이상에는 加花憶 할지요, 然하다면 엇지 天眼이 무섭지 안흐랴. 國稅에도 그러치 못할 것이어니 학교 增築費* 이는 인민 각개의 자신에 매인 임무이니 어듸까지던지 인민의 자각을 促할 것이어늘, 况 昆陽公普 증축비 5천4백원 중 該씨의 부담금 57원에 대하여는 무리한 不應이 안이라 昆陽에는 里距邀遠하야 通學키 불능한 동시에 당국의 認許를 어더 수년동안 경영 以來 하던 자기 洞里에 在한 佳湖講習會가 方在維持難 중이니 前記 57원 중 37원은 강습회에, 20원은 面학교에 납부하겟다는 상당한 이유와 조건이 안인가. 뿐만 안이라 君이 先番 增築期成總會 시에 예산 5천원 외 4백원 여유가 有한즉 該餘金은 佳湖講習會에 보조하겟다고 언명까지 안이 하엿는가. 그리고는 지금와셔는 시침이를 때이고 밤즁이 지난 뒤에 사람을 보내여 安眠을 방해하며 학교비를 내이라 닭잡고 이밥을 지여오라 하야 박해하야 여의치 못함에 兩次나 호출을 恣行하며 그도 시연치 못하야 面서기 有司를 대동하고 새벽에 출장하야 無牌自家用煙草耕作者調査 다시 坪數超過者를 들춘 결과 無牌 2명, 초과자 7인을 발견한 중 朴씨가 掛綱됨을 內喜하야 其 후 전부를 面에 호출하야 8인 외에는 용서란 특별 恩典을 내리고 奚獨 朴씨만을 加之 2坪 위반을 16평이라 보고하야 郡당국이 출장 조사 결과는 2평으로 판명되야 科料 5원의 처분을 밧게 된지라 朴씨는 분함을 不堪하야 郡당국에 사실의 顚末을 설파한 후 즉시 晋州郡 奈洞面 柳樹里에 이주하고 호적등본을 하려닛가 君은 호출에 불응한다는 이유로써 대담히 2차나 거절함으로 去 9월 28일에는 본인이 출두하여도 一樣 거절하다가 在傍人의 충고로 겨우 승낙만 하고 至子今 소식졊�차 업지 안은가. 君아, 君의 현직 면장의 임무가 인민을 謀害하야 私嫌을 갑흐려는 것 이외에는 발견치 못한 모양인가. 天理가 무심치 안나니 군의 금번 행동, 즉 朴씨를 모해코저 2평의 위반을 16평으로 보고하야 其 소득이 무엇인가. 사회의 여론은 말말고 군의 비루한 心行이 얼마나 폭로되엿는가. 군이여! 군을 위하여 出呼*者反乎爾의 一句를 하여 두노라.＜70＞
