Words I Wish to Ask

To the Elders (父老) residing in the Homeland (本國), I know that you are actively engaged in many fields (方面) to newly construct the culture (文化) of our society. I also know that your desire to see much of foreign civilization (外國文明) as a reference (參考) for this cultural construction (建設) is earnest. I know this from seeing many sightseeing groups (觀光團) coming here. However, I earnestly wish to ask you this. Isn't Japan (日本) also a foreign country? Being guests from abroad, why are your clothes and appearance (衣表) so slovenly (麤率)? Why display our lack of vigor (無氣力) so much even to foreigners? Please, I wish you would cut off your topknots (상투), take off your *kat* (갓), and adopt the world style, modern style, common style. The sight (景况) of so-called distinguished guests from Chosŏn (朝鮮) on Japan's premier Ginza street (銀座通) or in Suda-chō (須田町), wearing a topknot, *mang'gŏn* (網巾; headband), and black *kat* (黑笠), clad in an out-of-season white ramie *turumagi* (白紵두루막; overcoat), wearing convenient shoes (便利靴), walking hesitantly with hands clasped behind their backs (뒤짐 지고 어릿어릿하시는) completely devoid of vigor (氣力)—it is truly uncomfortable (未安스럽더이다) to behold. If it was this unpleasant for a child (子弟) of Chosŏn to see the elders (父老) of Chosŏn, how much more must the people of another country (異國) have ridiculed them? Koreans traversing all nations (萬國) in Chosŏn's traditional attire (固有의 衣表)—of course, that is a fine thing. However, it reveals too much of an appearance (態) of poverty and weakness (貧弱). Being guests from abroad, yet appearing not to have even 10 yen's worth (値) on their person... Please, cut off the topknots (샹투) and take off the black *kat* (黑笠). This is truly what I earnestly wish for. Also, after you sightsee, please make what you have seen our own, but never be intimidated or discouraged (落心); this I earnestly desire. One more thing I wish is that if you intend to see the sights and customs (風物) of foreign countries, please refrain from participating in group tours (團體的 觀光) as much as possible. Although there are convenient aspects to joining a group, there are more inconveniences.
That is, it is restrictive (不自由) and incomplete (不完全). The travel expenses (路費) do not differ much. Please, by all means, come as individuals (個人) so you can freely, at your own pace, thoroughly (充分히), and meticulously (細密히) see things. Here too, we have nearly 2,000 of our brethren (兄弟), so if elders (父老) from the homeland (故國) come, they will, as is customary (依例), guide (引導) you well. By all means, I hope you will aim for individual sightseeing (個人的 觀光) over group tours (團體的 觀光).<100>

**Summary**

The author, likely a Korean resident or student in Japan, pleads with Korean elders visiting Japan to modernize their appearance by cutting their topknots and abandoning traditional attire like the *kat* and *turumagi* in favor of Western-style clothing. The author argues that the traditional appearance looks slovenly, weak, and poor, causing embarrassment and inviting ridicule from the Japanese. The author also advises against group tours, suggesting individual travel allows for a more thorough, free, and meaningful experience, assuring potential visitors that fellow Koreans in Japan can offer assistance. This article provides insight into the internal debates among Koreans during the colonial period regarding cultural identity, modernization, and how they were perceived internationally, particularly by their colonizers. Historians might find the direct critique of traditional symbols and the advocacy for adopting "world style" dress and independent travel revealing about the pressures and desires for change and self-representation felt by some Koreans under Japanese rule.
