One Standing in a Wide Field, Prize-Winning Essay Announcement: New Poetry, 2nd Place
						Koksan-gun Cho Chŏngho

The place where you stand is wide.
Mountains recede far away
And only the arched sky is limitlessly high.

The place where you stand is wide.
Even the Sun, passing once a day,
Seems to do so wearily,
And the wind that sometimes blows
Goes and knows not how to return.
Ah! That place is an infinite wilderness (曠野).

“Standing One, who are you?”
The Standing One answers,
“I have no loving Parents,
No Lover to embrace me,
No sympathetic Friend,<21>
I have nothing,
I am an orphan whose whole world is desolate!”(5, 15)

Commentary: It is a good poem, easy to understand; in other words, its most beautiful aspect (點) is its straightforwardness without any embellishment (꿈임). However, there is undeniably a feeling that the Orphan’s surroundings could have been expressed more meticulously... We ask for the Author’s understanding regarding the removal of many overlapping phrases.<22>

**Summary**

This 1921 prize-winning poem by Cho Chŏngho depicts an isolated figure, an orphan, standing alone in a vast, indifferent field under an immense sky. The poem emphasizes feelings of loneliness, desolation, and abandonment. The accompanying commentary praises the poem's directness but suggests a need for more detailed description of the setting and notes editorial changes made to the text. From a historical perspective, the poem's stark portrayal of isolation in a boundless, empty landscape could symbolize the feelings of helplessness and national despair experienced by Koreans under Japanese colonial rule in the early 1920s. The existence of *Kaebyŏk* magazine, a known nationalist publication, and the editorial commentary provide insight into the literary scene and publishing practices of the period.

넓은 뜰에 섯는 者, 懸賞文發表 新詩 2等
						谷山郡 曹定昊
너 섯는 곳은 넓더라.
山은 멀리로 물러가고
굽읏한 한울만 限업시 놉더라.

너 섯는 곳은 넓더라.
하루에 한 번씩 지나가는 太陽도
支離하야 하는 듯 하고,
잇다금 불어가는 바람도
가고 돌아올줄 모르더라.
아! 그곳은 無限한 曠野일러라.

『섯는 者야 네가 누구냐?』
섯는 者 對答하되,
『나는 慈愛하신 父母도
안아 줄 情人도
同情하는 親舊도＜21＞
아모것도 업는
왼 世上이 쓸쓸한 孤兒이다!』(5, 15)

評 알아보기 쉬운 조흔 詩요, 다시 말하면 아무 꿈임도 업는 率直한 그 點이 가장 아름답소이다. 그러나 孤兒의 周圍가 좀더 緻密하게 表現이 되엇더면... 하는 感이 不無하오. 重疊되는 語句를 만히 削除한 것에 對하야는 作者의 諒解를 엇고자하오.＜22＞
