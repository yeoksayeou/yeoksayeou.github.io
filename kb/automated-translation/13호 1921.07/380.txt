**Body Text Translation:**
Evening, Prize Contest Announcement: New Poetry, Honorable Mention
						Yŏngam Pak P'anjong

Boundlessly wide green field
I stand in its very center
In the pale red western sky
A single lark flutters about
A purplish wave rises in the barley field
On its leaves shines the tender pink sunlight...
Ah! Now it is evening.

Critique: The feeling of "Evening" comes across directly. However, it is regrettable that the refinement (推敲) is too lacking. As the title chosen by the author would have killed the meaning of the whole piece, although it may be too arbitrary (獨斷的), I unavoidably changed the title, so please understand. <23>

**Summary**

This entry presents a short pastoral poem titled "Evening" by Pak P'anjong, depicting a tranquil scene in a field at sunset. It is followed by a brief critique, likely from the magazine's editor, praising the poem's atmosphere but lamenting its lack of polish. The critique also notes that the editor changed the poem's original title because the author's choice supposedly detracted from the overall meaning. This piece is interesting for colonial Korean history as it shows the early development of modern Korean poetry (新詩) published in influential magazines like *Gaebyeok*. The editor's critique and unilateral title change offer a glimpse into the editorial practices and potential power dynamics within the literary scene of the time, possibly reflecting constraints or aesthetic judgments prevalent in the colonial period.

아! 只今은 저녁이다.

評 「저녁」이라는 느낌이 바로 날듯하오, 그러나 推敲가 넘우 부족한 것이 遺憾이오, 作者의 題目으로는 全軆의 意味가 죽게 되겟기로 넘우 獨斷的이지마는 不得已 題目을 고치엇스니 짐작하시오.＜23＞
