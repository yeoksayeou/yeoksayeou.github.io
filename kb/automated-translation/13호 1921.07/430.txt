Editorial Department Notice

As a result of this Editorial Department announcing a call for submissions for a writing contest, an unprecedented response in both quantity and number has been received. How can this department express sufficient gratitude to all contributors? However, upon careful consideration and selection by the assigned judges, it is truly unexpected and quite regrettable that there were no first or second-place winners for essays (論文), no first or second-place winners for short pieces (小品文), no first-place winner for new poetry (新詩), and no first-place winner for novels (小說). Nevertheless, as the proverb goes, we do not expect to be full from the first spoonful. We believe the future is bright, depending on the efforts of everyone. Furthermore, while according to the contest rules, we would naturally present the designated modest prizes only to those selected in their respective ranks, our company is decidedly not focused solely on finances but prioritizes readers for the sake of our nation's culture. Therefore, we have decided to distribute the prize money designated for the first and second places in essays to the third-place and honorable mention winners; the prize money for the first and second places in short pieces to the third-place and honorable mention winners; the prize money for first place in new poetry among the second-place, third-place, and two honorable mention winners (a total of four individuals); and the prize money for first place in novels among the second-place, third-place, and honorable mention winners (a total of three individuals), divided equally in addition to their originally designated prize money. This is a cause for celebration for this department, shared with all the award recipients.

Kaebyŏk Editorial Department <62>

**Summary**

This editorial notice from the magazine *Kaebyŏk* announces the results of a writing contest. While expressing gratitude for the large number of submissions, the editors note with regret that no submissions met the standard for first or second place in essays and short pieces, or for first place in new poetry and novels. Despite this, instead of keeping the prize money, the magazine decided to redistribute the funds allocated for the top prizes among the lower-ranked winners (third place and honorable mentions) in each category, emphasizing their commitment to fostering national culture over financial gain. For historians, this article offers insight into the perceived state of Korean literary and intellectual production in the early 1920s, suggesting a potential gap between the magazine's standards and the quality of submissions received, possibly reflecting the challenges faced under colonial rule. The magazine's explicit statement about prioritizing national culture and readers over finances is also noteworthy, highlighting the publication's role in the nationalist cultural movement.
