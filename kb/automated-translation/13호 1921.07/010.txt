紀念의 辭
(Commemorative Address)

1
It has already been one full year since Kaebyŏk (開闢) began, and as we now publish this commemorative issue today, we cannot suppress the deep emotion (慷慨) filling our hearts.
What great glory could there be in commemorating just one year for a magazine enterprise that possesses an infinite lifespan? However, in our position and circumstances, even the struggle of a short first year has been bitter and fraught with hardship (苦澁되며 間關함), much like the feeling a traveler returned from Dongting Lake (洞庭歸客) after crossing the treacherous Emei Plank Road (峨嵋棧道) cannot help but experience, gazing back from afar at the steep dangers of Bashu (巴蜀) and letting out a long sigh.

Though spring flowers and autumn moons are not unpleasant, that fierce winds and cold snow also exist is the way of the four seasons. The endlessly changing waves of the world, the rough and difficult affairs of humankind—especially when trying, like a helpless orphan (孤子無賴) of weak constitution (弱質), to advance day by day along the year's path (途程)—while there might have been the joys of flowery mornings and moonlit evenings, how much more frequent must have been the arduous suffering (苦行) of winds and snows?

However, we confess that we have always dwelt in the kingdom of joy (喜悅). Just as a child seized by fear looks upon the warm face of its loving mother (慈母) and breaks into an innocent smile, so too, though our circumstances may be difficult, when we yearn for the deep kindness (厚誼) of the various senior figures in the public sphere (江湖上 諸先輩) and the wise readers throughout the land (滿天下 讀者諸賢) who always protect us from behind (背後), our feelings are truly boundless.

To look back on the past and critique merits and faults is to strive all the harder in all present endeavors and to advance further in all future progress. With sincerity and reverence, faith and principle (誠과 敬, 信과 法), we solemnly pledge (盟誓) ourselves to make many contributions for the eternal future.

Accordingly, we are confident that the loving protection (愛護) of the various senior figures in the public sphere and the deep kindness (厚誼) of the wise readers throughout the land will eternally fuse and penetrate (融合 貫通) the spirit of Kaebyŏk and never be extinguished. The reason is that the construction of our new culture is urgent (時急), the planning for the nation's (民族) prosperity is pressing (緊切), and adapting to the times (時代에 順應) is inevitable (必然). Herein lies the commemoration of Kaebyŏk's first anniversary, and also its eternal commemoration. <1>

**Summary**

This editorial commemorates the first anniversary of the magazine *Kaebyŏk*. The author reflects on the immense difficulties and hardships faced during the first year, comparing the struggle to a perilous journey through treacherous landscapes. Despite these challenges, the piece expresses deep gratitude to the magazine's supporters – respected elders and readers – whose encouragement provided solace and strength. Looking forward, the editorial pledges continued dedication to contributing to Korea's future, emphasizing the urgent need for new cultural construction, national prosperity, and adaptation to the times, framing the magazine's mission as historically necessary and enduring. For historians, this article offers a glimpse into the challenging environment for Korean cultural and nationalist expression under Japanese rule in the early 1920s. It highlights the resilience of Korean intellectuals, their reliance on community support, and their framing of cultural work (like publishing a magazine) as a crucial contribution to national survival and progress, blending traditional literary metaphors with modern nationalist aspirations.

紀念의 辭

開闢이 開闢한지 어언 1周年이 됨이어 今日로써 이 記念號를 發行함에 이르러 吾人은 스스로 滿腔의 慷慨를 禁치 못하겟도다.
無限의 壽命을 가진 雜誌의 事業으로써 1周年의 紀念이라 함이 무엇이 그리 榮光이 되리요마는, 그러나 우리의 處地와 境遇에 잇서는 短한 1周年의 奮鬪도 苦澁되며 間關함이 마치 峨嵋棧道를 넘어 온 洞庭歸客이 멀리 巴蜀의 險峻을 바라고 길이 太息을 發함과 如한 感想이 업지아니치 못하도다.
春花秋月이 조치 아님은 아니나 烈風寒雪이 또 업지아니함은 四季의 常事라 變遷無常한 世波, 崎嶇多艱한 人事, 더구나 孤子無賴한 弱質로써 1年의 途程을 하루가티 전진코저 할 때에 花朝月夕의 樂도 업지 아니하얏슬지나 風風雪雪의 苦行인덜 그 얼마나 重複하얏스랴.
그러나 우리는 恒常 喜悅의 王國에 들어잇섯슴을 自白하노니 譬컨대 恐怖에 쌔인 어린아이가 慈母의 따뜻한 얼굴을 바라보고 天眞의 웃음을 發함가티 우리의 境遇는 비록 難澁할지라도 우리의 背後에서 恒常 우리를 愛護하는 江湖上 諸先輩이며 滿天下 讀者諸賢의 厚誼를 憧憬할 때에 우리의 느낌은 實로 限이 업섯도다.
過去를 돌아보고 功過를 批評함은 現在의 모든 힘쓸 일을 一層 힘쓰며 將來의 모든 나아감을 더욱 나아가고저 함이니 우리는 誠과 敬, 信과 法으로 삼가 永遠의 將來를 爲하야 만흔 貢獻이 잇기를 스스로 盟誓하노라.
딸아서 江湖上 諸先輩의 愛護와 滿天下 讀者諸賢의 厚誼는 永遠히 開闢의 精神과 融合 貫通하야 꺼지지 아니하리라 自信하노니 其故는 우리의 新文化 建設이 時急함이며 民族의 繁榮을 圖함이 緊切함이며 時代에 順應함이 必然됨으로써니 이곳 開闢 1周年의 紀念이며 또한 永遠의 紀念이 되리라.＜1＞
