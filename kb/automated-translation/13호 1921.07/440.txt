Article Type: 사고·편집후기 (Notice/Editor's Postscript)

As already announced with apologies through various newspapers, the June issue of this magazine unfortunately touched upon the sensitivities of the authorities and was confiscated on the very day of its publication. We then attempted to publish a temporary issue, but this also did not go as intended, and only today are we finally able to greet you all. Whether it turned out well or poorly, for us who have wandered for 31 days solely for your sake, how did our hearts truly feel when we saw the way to meet you cut off?

We do not know whether the cover of this commemorative issue has artistic value or not. It is merely the picture drawn for the cover of the inaugural issue published on June 25th last year, which could not be presented before you due to the sales ban on the inaugural issue at that time. Since this issue is the first-anniversary commemorative issue, we have simply reused the cover from that time. We hope you will look upon it with the feeling of encountering the inaugural issue as well.

The results of the Great Person Poll and the Prize Essay Contest were very favorable. In fact, even we who organized them did not imagine such results. Based on the goodwill you have shown us, we will now introduce the 10 Great Persons announced this time sequentially in each issue starting from the upcoming August issue. We know you must be anticipating with interest how detailed and accurate these introductions will turn out to be. Regarding the prize essays, as the selectors have each written their impressions, we will not comment separately, but we are ever so grateful for the warm intentions with which you submitted them.

Regarding the congratulatory messages and advertisements kindly sent out of sympathy for this magazine's commemorative issue, those that arrived late could not be included due to printing deadlines. We ask for your understanding and forgiveness. <63>

**Summary**

This editor's afterword from the July 1921 issue of *Kaebyŏk* explains that the previous month's issue was confiscated by authorities immediately upon publication. An attempt to publish a temporary issue failed. This current issue marks the magazine's first anniversary and reuses the cover art from the banned inaugural issue. The editors express gratitude for the strong reader participation in a "Great Person Poll" and a prize essay contest, announcing plans to feature the poll's top ten figures in future issues. They also apologize for being unable to print congratulatory messages and ads that arrived too late due to printing schedules. From a historical perspective, the text is significant for its direct reference to censorship ("confiscated", "authorities", "sensitivities") under Japanese colonial rule, illustrating the challenges faced by Korean publications. It also highlights the magazine's persistence (symbolically reusing the banned cover) and the active engagement of its readership despite the repressive political climate.

이번 記念號의 表紙는 美術上으로 보아 價値가 잇고 업는 與否는 저이가 모르나이다. 다못 그것은 昨年 6月25日 發行 創刊號 表紙에 그린 그림이엇사오나 當時 創刊號의 發賣禁止로 여러분의 前에 展開되지 못한 것이온 바 이번 號가 卽 創刊1周年 記念號임으로 當時의 表紙를 因用한 것뿐이오니 創刊號를 아울러 對하는 듯한 늑김으로써 보아주시기 願이외다.

本誌 記念號에 對하야 열어분이 同情으로 주신 祝辭와 祝賀廣告中 晩着된 것은 印刷의 時日關係로써 登載치 못하엿사오니 恕諒하여 주시기 바라나이다.＜63＞
