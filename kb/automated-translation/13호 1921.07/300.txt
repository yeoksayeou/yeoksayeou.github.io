One Year in Our Publishing World

Commemorating the first anniversary of this magazine's founding, quietly looking back on the past year in our publishing world, an indescribable feeling pierces my heart. Putting aside all other words, I will simply transcribe the historical facts of our magazine world (limited to those published within Chosŏn) that appeared from June 1st of last year to May 31st of this year.

June
1st: 「Sŏgwang」 No. 5 was published.

26th: 「Yŏja Siron」 No. 4 was published.
27th: An extra issue of 「Kaebyŏk」, which had been banned from sale on the 25th, was published but was also banned from sale due to the authorities' disapproval (忌諱).
Same day: 「Yŏgwang」 No. 1 was published.
30th: Again, a provisional issue of 「Kaebyŏk」 was published.

Addendum: As 「Kaebyŏk」 changed its publication date from the 25th of each month to the 1st of each month, the issue scheduled for October 25th became the November 1st issue, resulting in no publication of said magazine this month.

November
1st: 「Haksaenggye」 No. 3 [Typo in original text, likely should be 4] was published.
Same day: 「Sin Ch'ŏngnyŏn」 No. 3 [Typo in original text, likely should be 4] was published.

The records shown above do not include items that, although bearing the title of a magazine, have the nature of newsletters (會報) or are like church publications (敎會의 機關紙). However, looking at the above, although quite a few new magazines were launched each month during the past year, the number that suspended or ceased publication was also considerable. Furthermore, the fact that the majority of magazines could not be published issue by issue (逐號 發行) is not an ordinary matter. We know that many causes lie hidden behind the scenes of our magazine world developing in this way. We leave the nature of these causes to your speculation (推想) and present the facts again in the table below.<159>

Note: In the table above, the number inside □ indicates the issue number of each magazine published in that month, and — inside □ indicates no publication in that month.<160>

**Summary**

This article from *Kaebyŏk* magazine commemorates its own first anniversary by meticulously listing the publication dates and issue numbers of various Korean magazines published within Korea between June 1920 and May 1921. It highlights the launch of new magazines, the suspensions or cessations of others, and notes the frequent inability of many magazines to publish consecutively. The article specifically details *Kaebyŏk*'s own struggles, including multiple instances of censorship (sales bans) and a legal battle over content culminating in a fine for the publisher. For historians, this article provides a valuable snapshot of the nascent, vibrant, yet heavily restricted Korean publishing landscape under early Japanese colonial rule. It documents not only the existence and timeline of specific publications but also explicitly mentions censorship actions ('發賣禁止', '當局의 忌諱') and legal prosecution, offering primary source evidence of the challenges faced by Korean intellectuals and publishers trying to operate under the Government-General's control.
