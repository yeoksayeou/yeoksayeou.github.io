Announcement of Great Men Poll Results

The Great Men Poll announced in the May issue of this magazine greatly aroused the interest of readers both inside and outside [Korea], obtaining results beyond expectations. Now, the great men who received the most points and the next highest are announced as follows (However, those with fewer than 100 points are omitted here):

Ten Selected Great Men

Thought……Yi Hwang
Religion……Ch'oe Che-u
Politics……Yi I
Science……Sŏ Kyŏng-dŏk
Military……Yi Sun-sin
Industry……Mun Ik-chŏm

**Summary**

This article announces the results of a reader poll conducted by the magazine *Kaebyŏk* to select the ten greatest figures in Korean history across different fields like thought, religion, politics, science, military, industry, literature, education, art, and social improvement. The list reflects prominent historical figures recognized by the readership in 1921. From the perspective of Korean colonial history, this poll is interesting as it reflects a contemporary (1921) Korean assessment of national heroes and important figures across various domains during a period of Japanese rule. It shows an effort to define and celebrate Korean identity and achievement through its historical figures, potentially as a subtle form of cultural nationalism or resistance. The inclusion of figures like Ch'oe Che-u (founder of Tonghak) and Yu Kil-chun (an enlightenment thinker) alongside more traditional figures is also noteworthy.
