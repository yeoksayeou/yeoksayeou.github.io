●Kaebyŏk First Anniversary Commemorative Item

As a commemorative item for our first anniversary, our company intends to set aside several copies from our magazine's back issues (from January to June), a half-year's worth, compile them into a single volume with beautiful Western-style binding, and offer it at a special price to interested readers. We urge all interested individuals not to miss this opportunity and to request it immediately with advance payment.

Provided that: Special Price is Two Won per volume
(Shipping and Western-style binding costs are borne by our company)

**Summary**

This is an announcement from the *Kaebyŏk* magazine celebrating its first anniversary. The publisher offers readers a chance to purchase a bound volume containing the magazine's issues from the first half of the year (January to June). This commemorative edition features Western-style binding, and the special price of two Won includes shipping and binding costs, requiring prepayment. For historians, this notice reveals the magazine's marketing strategies, its perceived value to readers (enough to warrant a bound collection), the cost of such publications (two Won, including binding/shipping), and the use of "Western-style binding" as a selling point in colonial Korea.
