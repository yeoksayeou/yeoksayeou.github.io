漢詩
						黙齋 崔誠愚

開闢 (Kaebyŏk; The Opening/Genesis)
似夢非醒困臥時 Like a dream, not yet awake, lying weary,
漫漫長夜太支離 The endless long night is too fragmented.
金鷄唱曙猛驚起 When the golden cock crows dawn, I startle awake,
頑闢癡開知有期 Knowing there is a time for the stubborn to be rent and the foolish to open.

伴林偶丁圭徐正觀光前訪徐處士達于城北洞 (Accompanying Im U-jŏng and Kyu Sŏ-jŏng before sightseeing to visit the scholar-recluse Sŏ Tal at Sŏngbuk-tong)
夕陽聯袂訪山人 In the evening sun, arm-in-arm, we visit the mountain dweller,
望裏雲霞黯入神 In the view, clouds and mist dimly enter the spirit.
谷鳥多情啼閣閣 Valley birds, full of feeling, cry ‘ggak-ggak,’
林花自馥送陳陳 Forest flowers, naturally fragrant, send forth wave after wave of scent.
淸談不覺溪移月 In clear conversation, unaware the moon has moved over the stream,
小醉猶詑甕貯春 Slightly drunk, still boasting of the spring stored in the jar.
却憶當年滿園雪 Thinking back to that year when snow filled the garden,
歲丁已有雪夜之飮 (There was drinking on a snowy night in the year Chŏngyu [likely 1917 or 1857])
櫻桃今日喜紅均 Cherries today delight with their uniform redness.

題城北洞四可亭 (Inscribing a Poem at Sagajŏng Pavilion in Sŏngbuk-tong)
四圍山色赴樓晴 The colors of surrounding mountains rush to the clear pavilion,
門掩乘楊三五行 The gate hides rows of three and five willows swaying.
勝境悠然方卸慮 In this fine scene, leisurely shedding worries,
淸簫何事又關情 Why does the clear flute stir feelings again?
題詩劇愛碧蕉影 Writing a poem, I deeply love the shadow of the green banana plant,
擧酒時聞黃鳥聲 Raising my cup, I sometimes hear the yellow bird's song.
衣滴林霏歸路晩 Clothes damp with forest mist, the way back is late,
殷勤溪月送人明 The earnest stream moon brightly sees me off.

開闢後一年 (One Year After Kaebyŏk)

石溪 (Sŏk-kye; Stone Stream)
人情偏愛晩生兒 Human nature especially loves a late-born child,
况是能言能步時 Especially when it can speak and walk.
試看一年前進力 Look at the strength of progress over the past year,
將來成就信無疑 Future accomplishments, believe without doubt. <146>

牛耳洞八景 (Uidong P'algyŏng; Eight Views of Ui-dong)
三角山, 道詵寺, 濯碧廓, 杜鵑亭, 降仙樓, 道峯, 鳳凰閣, 牛溪, 皆是牛耳洞之環境而各有獨特之景色
(Samgak Mountain, Tosŏn Temple, T'akpyŏk Pavilion, Tujyŏn Pavilion, Kangsŏn Pavilion, Tobong Peak, Ponghwang Pavilion, Ugye Stream, are all surroundings of Ui-dong, each possessing a unique scenery.)

三角落照 (Samgak Naktcho; Sunset Glow on Samgak Mountain)
玲瓏雲氣畵難成 Translucent cloud-shapes are hard to paint,
水影山陰忽復明 Water reflections and mountain shadows suddenly brighten again.
何必牛山齊景淚 Why shed tears like Duke Jing of Qi on Mount Niu?
今人不下古人情 People today are no less feeling than those of old.

道詵曉鐘 (Tosŏn Hyojong; Dawn Bell at Tosŏn Temple)
門掩重重曉起遲 Gates heavily barred, dawn rising is slow,
有聲隱隱始難知 A faint sound is hard to discern at first.
居人慣識僧家事 Residents are familiar with the monks' affairs,
兒亦能言供佛時 Even children can say when it's time for Buddha offerings.

濯碧聽流 (T'akpyŏk Ch'ŏngnyu; Listening to the Stream at T'akpyŏk)
潺湲流下石層層 Murmuring, it flows down layers of stone,
谷谷添波聲勢增 Valley by valley, waves are added, the momentum grows.
若使人人來聽此 If everyone were made to come and listen to this,
安知三伏酷炎蒸 How would they know the harsh sweltering of the three hottest days?

杜鵑觀德 (Tujyŏn Kwandŏk; Observing Virtue at Tujyŏn Pavilion [likely an archery spot])
彎弓聯立一層臺 Drawing bows, standing together on a platform,
連發五矢次第回 Five arrows are shot in succession and retrieved.
落處縱云過不及 Though the landing spots are said to be over or short,
先觀其德後論才 First observe the virtue, then discuss the skill.

牛溪飛瀑 (Ugye Pip'ok; Flying Waterfall at Ugye Stream)
急流觸石石生烟 Swift currents hit rocks, rocks produce mist,
噴沫廻籠十里川 Spraying foam swirls around ten *ri* of the stream.
洞邃還憐淸有響 The valley is deep, yet cherish the clear echo,
殷雷不斷動晴天 Continuous loud thunder moves the clear sky.

降仙對局 (Kangsŏn Taeguk; Playing Baduk at Kangsŏn Pavilion)
樓上人如羽化仙 People upstairs are like feathered immortals,
閒中日月不知年 In leisure, sun and moon pass, not knowing the year.
丁丁落子輸嬴地 *Tting-tting*, stones fall on the board of loss and gain,
客亦爛柯忘世緣 Guests too, like the woodcutter with the rotten axe handle, forget worldly ties.

道峯歸雲 (Tobong Kwiun; Returning Clouds at Tobong Peak)
峯頭有石石生雲 On the peak's head are rocks, rocks give birth to clouds,
雨處重重風處分 Where it rains, they are heavy; where the wind blows, they scatter.
高人知是居其下 A noble person knows they live below it,
瑞氣化爲五色文 Auspicious energy transforms into five-colored patterns.

鳳閣賞春 (Ponggak Sangch'un; Appreciating Spring at Ponghwang Pavilion)
一閣獨占滿洞春 One pavilion monopolizes the whole valley's spring,
早花先落晩花新 Early flowers fall first, late flowers are fresh.
人言牛耳今勝古 People say Ui-dong today surpasses the past,
也是地靈必待人 This too means the land's spirit surely awaits people. <147>

**Summary**

This collection of Hansi (Classical Chinese poems) by Ch'oe Sŏng'u, published in the magazine *Kaebyŏk* in 1921, explores themes of change, the passage of time, and the beauty of nature, particularly focusing on specific locations around Seoul like Sŏngbuk-tong and Ui-dong. The poems range from reflections on the dawning of a new era ("Kaebyŏk") and progress ("One Year After Kaebyŏk") to detailed depictions of scenic spots ("Eight Views of Ui-dong") and convivial moments with friends. From a Korean colonial history perspective, the publication in *Kaebyŏk*, a magazine associated with the Ch'ŏndogyo movement and Korean cultural nationalism, is significant. The poems, while seemingly focused on nature and tradition, subtly hint at resilience, hope for the future ("Knowing there is a time for the stubborn to be rent and the foolish to open," "Future accomplishments, believe without doubt"), and an appreciation for Korean landscapes and heritage during a period of suppressed national identity. The focus on specific Korean locales like Ui-dong and the assertion that "People say Ui-dong today surpasses the past" could be seen as a quiet affirmation of Korean place and potential.
