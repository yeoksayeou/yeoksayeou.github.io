Company Announcement
Especially to the Managers of Local Distribution Points and our Dear Readers

One, Please send payment for this magazine and postage in advance (for three months, six months, or one year). We cannot send the magazine without advance payment.

Two, When sending money from each parish (敎區), please send it directly using the postal transfer account Kyŏngsŏng 8106 under the name of Kaebyŏk Publishing Company (開闢社). If you indirectly send it using the postal transfer account Kyŏngsŏng 1363 under the name No Hŏn-yong (盧憲容), there may be discrepancies as it might not be received at the expected time.

Three, When sending money via postal transfer, please be sure to clearly write the reason for the remittance in the communication section on the back of the postal transfer form, stating specifically, for example, "Payment of X Won X Chŏn for Kaebyŏk from issue X to issue X (Y copies) and postage." If there is no information in the communication section, it causes great difficulty in processing the payment.

Four, When corresponding with our company, whether by postcard or sealed letter, please be sure to accurately write the sender's full name and address (Province, County, Township, Village, House Number). If the address is unclear, there is no way for us to send replies to your inquiries or the items you requested.

**Summary**

This is an administrative announcement from the accounting department of Kaebyŏk magazine, published in July 1921. It instructs distributors and readers on subscription payment procedures, emphasizing the need for advance payment and providing specific details for using postal money transfer accounts. It requests payments be sent directly to the company's account (Kyŏngsŏng 8106) rather than an individual's account (No Hŏn-yong, Kyŏngsŏng 1363) to avoid processing delays. Furthermore, it stresses the importance of clearly stating the purpose of payment on the transfer form and providing a full, accurate sender address on all correspondence to ensure proper handling of replies and requested items. For historians, this notice offers insights into the practical business operations of a Korean magazine under Japanese rule, including its reliance on the Japanese postal transfer system (振替口座), its distribution network (mentioning 分賣所 and potentially 敎區 linked to Ch'ŏndogyo), and the administrative challenges of managing subscriptions and communication with readers across colonial Korea, reflected in the detailed address requirements. The differentiation between the company and an individual's account might also suggest aspects of the magazine's financial management or organization.
