The Person Seen in a Dream
						Kim Sŏksong (金石松)

The person seen in a dream—
But as I
opened my eyes and moved my legs
walking towards the City

His head was the size of a fist
His body was
three times the size
of a person
And he wore luxurious
silk clothes

The person seen in a dream—
But as I
opened my eyes and moved my legs
walking towards the Mountain Village

His head was the size of a large gourd
His body was miserably
just gaunt bones
And he wore tattered
hemp clothes

Ah! What a Contrast!
Ah! What an Illusion! <121>

**Summary**

The poem contrasts two figures seen in dreams, encountered metaphorically while walking towards the city and the mountain village respectively. The city figure is disproportionately small-headed but large-bodied and richly dressed, symbolizing perhaps bloated, unthinking wealth. The village figure is large-headed but emaciated and poorly clothed, representing impoverished, possibly suffering but thoughtful, rural life. The poem starkly portrays the extreme socio-economic disparities of the time through these contrasting visions. For historians, this poem offers a poignant contemporary reflection on the severe divide between urban prosperity (often linked to collaborators or Japanese interests) and rural destitution during the early colonial period in Korea, captured through stark, allegorical imagery.

꿈에 본 사람
						金石松
꿈에 본 사람-
그러나 내가
눈을 뜨고 다리를 놀리어
都會로 거러 가면서

그의 머리는 줌억만 하고
그의 몸은 사람의
三倍나 되게 크다
그리고 그는 華麗한
비단옷을 입엇다

꿈에 본 사람-
그러나 내가
눈을 뜨고 다리를 놀리어
山村으로 거러 가면서

그의 머리는 큰박만 하고
그의 몸은 참흑하게
뼈만 앙상하다
그리고 그는 떨어진
베옷을 입엇다

아! 어찌한 對照!
아! 어찌한 幻覺!＜121＞
