Correction

Regarding the text addressed to Hyŏn-gun of Saeng (生의 玄君) in the New Year issue, on page 113, top section, line 2, "Ueda" (上田) was a miswriting of "Inoue" (井上), and "Yabe" (矢部) was a miswriting of "Yatabe" (矢田部). We hereby correct this. <67>

**Summary**

This article is a brief correction notice written by Hwang Sŏk-u for the July 1921 issue of the magazine *Kaebyŏk*. It points out and rectifies transcription errors concerning two Japanese names (Inoue and Yatabe, mistakenly written as Ueda and Yabe) that appeared in a previous article from the New Year's issue, which was addressed to "Hyŏn-gun of Saeng". From the perspective of Korean colonial history, this notice highlights the intellectual engagement with Japanese figures or sources requiring accurate naming, even amidst the colonial context. It also underscores the editorial standards and attention to detail maintained by prominent Korean publications like *Kaebyŏk* during this period.
