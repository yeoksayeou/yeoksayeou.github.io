What is the System of Eastern Moral Philosophy?
						Recorded by Kang Ch'unsan

Elder Master Cheng (大程子)

Introduction (Biography and Writings)
Cheng Hao's (程顥) courtesy name was Bóchún (伯淳), and he was a man of Hénán (河南). His father, Cheng Xiang (程珦), reached the official rank of Tàizhōng Dàfū (太中太夫). Bóchún was born in the first year of the Míngdào (明道) era. As an infant, he could not yet speak well. His paternal aunt was holding him and walking when she unknowingly dropped a hairpin (釵). Several days later, when she looked for it, the Master pointed with his hand. Following where he pointed, indeed, the hairpin was there. At the age of 15, he and his younger brother Yīchuān (伊川) together went to study under Zhōu Màoshū (周茂叔, Zhou Dunyi). From this time, it is said, he resolutely grew weary of the examination system's endeavors and set his mind on seeking the Way. He died on the 15th day of the 6th month in the 8th year of the Yuánfēng (元豐) era, at the age of 54. Wén Yànbó (文彦博) titled his epitaph Míngdào (明道). Apart from several dozen pieces of his poetry and prose, there is nothing else particularly notable, and the only source where his doctrines can be seen is the yǔlù (語錄, recorded sayings).

His Scholarly Lineage
The thought of Confucius (孔子) lies within the Analects, and the central point of his thought is in perfecting one's own character. That is, it lies in cultivating the character capable of putting into practice the Way of the ancient kings' governance. After Confucius passed away, Mencius (孟子) alone inherited and transmitted this learning. Along with the flourishing of scholarship in the Sòng (宋) dynasty, there were Shàozi (邵子, Shao Yong) and Zhōuzi (周子, Zhou Dunyi), both famous as philosophers. However, amidst uncertainty about whether they had grasped the intent of Confucius, the one who was able truly to grasp Confucius's intent must be said to be Chéng Míngdào (程明道, Cheng Hao). Yīchuān (伊川, Cheng Yi), writing Míngdào's biographical sketch (行狀), said, "The Master, born 1400 years later, obtained the untransmitted learning from the remaining classics (遺經)." This statement is fitting. Míngdào's philosophy is not pure philosophy; it lies in the learning of self-cultivation (修身學). This is because he was indifferent to ethics [as abstract theory] and emphasized practice (實踐).

Ethical Theory
(1) Benevolence (仁) is Primordial Qi (元氣) Míngdào greatly agonized to harmonize [the idea of] inherent goodness (性善) with Confucius, seeking explanations by consulting various scholars. Although his thought was not yet settled at the time, he claimed, "Seeking it back in the Six Classics (六經), I obtained it." <37> The Six Classics refer to the Rites (禮), Music (樂), Odes (詩), Documents (書), Changes (易), and Spring and Autumn Annals (春秋). Confucius advocated a single concept, Benevolence (仁). The virtue of Benevolence is impossible to name or describe; its greatness has no outside, and its smallness has no inside. The Book of Changes (易) states, "The great virtue of Heaven and Earth is called life (生)." Therefore, Benevolence is precisely life. This life comes into being through the Qi of the One Origin (一元之氣). The Changes says, "Great indeed is Qián, the originator (乾元)! All things rely on it for their beginning." The Qi of the One Origin cannot but be Benevolence; Benevolence cannot but be good. Therefore, the Changes says, "The Origin (元) is the chief of goodness (善之長). Humans and creatures all receive this Qi of the One Origin to be born and grow; therefore, how could their nature (性) not be good?" Míngdào believed that Benevolence is good because it is the Primordial Qi. This is precisely how he obtained the foundation for his line [of argument], surpassing Xúnzǐ (荀子) and harmonizing Confucius and Mencius. All his lifelong discussions ultimately return to this point.
(2) Nature (性) is Primordial Qi This greatly differs from previous thinkers and is the point most worthy of attention in Míngdào's theory of nature. He said, "Life is called nature (生之謂性); nature is Qi (性卽氣), Qi is nature (氣卽性); it is called life." The phrase "nature is Qi" refers to the Primordial Qi discussed in the previous section. Therefore, he says nature is good. He also said, "Once humans are born with a certain endowment of Qi (氣稟), it is impossible for there not to be good and evil in principle (理). However, it is not that good and evil are originally two opposing things within nature that give rise [to each other]. That there is good and evil from infancy is simply the natural result of the Qi endowment. Just as good is originally nature, evil must also be called nature." If so, then Míngdào's theory of nature is incomplete.
(3) Nature is Absolute Since nature is Primordial Qi, and Primordial Qi fills the space between Heaven and Earth, its absoluteness requires no argument. Based on this concept, he drafted the piece called the "Essay on Stabilizing Nature" (定性書). Discussing the absoluteness of nature, he said, "What is called 'stabilizing (定)' means that movement is also stability, stillness is also stability. There is no anticipating or responding (將迎), no inner or outer (內外). If one treats external things as 'outer' and posits the self [in opposition] to follow them, this means the self considers nature to have an inner and outer."
(4) Benevolence is Absolute Since Benevolence is Primordial Qi, which is Nature, its absoluteness needs no further mention. However, Nature views Primordial Qi statically, while Benevolence views Primordial Qi dynamically; it amounts to no more than this. His "Essay on Recognizing Benevolence" (識仁篇) argues based on this concept. Discussing the absoluteness of Benevolence, he said, "Benevolence is holistically unified (渾然) and encompasses both things (物) and substance (軆); Righteousness (義), Propriety (禮), Wisdom (智), and Trustworthiness (信) are all Benevolence." He also explained using an analogy from medicine, saying, "In medical texts, paralysis (痿痺) of the hands and feet is called 'insensitivity/lack of benevolence' (不仁)." This saying must be called a most excellent description. The benevolent person forms one body (一軆) with Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things; there is nothing that is not the self. When the hands and feet are 'not benevolent' (不仁), the Qi of the entire body also fails to penetrate through, and they do not belong to the self. Therefore, it is said, "Extensively conferring benefits and aiding the multitudes (博施濟衆) is the function (功用) of the sage." Thus, the meaning of Benevolence as the absolute, unifying principle of the cosmos can be seen here. Among the dozens of passages where the Two Cheng brothers discuss Benevolence, none deviate from this meaning. <38>
(5) Mind (心) The life-giving Qi of Heaven and Earth's Primal Origin (乾元之氣) is Nature (性), which is Benevolence (仁). Therefore, the form (形) cannot but be the Way (道). He said, "The Way is Nature (道卽性). If one seeks Nature outside the Way, or seeks the Way outside Nature, then it is not the Sage's discussion of Heavenly Virtue (天德)." If so, what is his view regarding the Mind? If asked, it would be said that there is a distinction between the Human Mind (人心) and the Mind of the Way (道心). The Mind of the Way, speaking from its original nature, is Heavenly Principle (天理). Heavenly Principle is the Way. Only when obscured by human desires (人欲) does one forget Heavenly Virtue. Therefore, when human desires are removed, the Mind becomes Heavenly Principle. The Mind, in general, is an active entity. In its existence, it cannot but be dynamic (力學的). Now, what Míngdào calls Heavenly Principle is Nature, which is Primordial Qi. Thus, the Mind is also Primordial Qi, a dynamic reality (力學的 實在).
Conclusion of Ethical Theory The life-giving Qi (生氣) of Heaven and Earth is called Benevolence. In humans, this is called Nature, the Way, the Mind of the Way. Therefore, the Mind of the Way is the same for all people, and what the sages transmitted invariably originates from this Mind. This is absolute, and the method for manifesting its innate genuineness (天眞) is as follows.

His Theory of Cultivation (工夫論)
The effort (工夫) of cultivation (修爲) lies in focusing on one thing without distraction (主一無適). Each person's nature is originally complete and perfect (圓滿具足). Mencius's statement, "The myriad things are all complete within me (萬物皆備於我)," is indeed true. It is only because human desires excessively obscure it that the originally good nature cannot manifest its own brilliance. Therefore, the effort of cultivation simply lies in removing human desires and preserving only the public Mind of the Way. Thus, the method lies solely in managing the mind through reverence (敬). When reverent, the natural, wondrous substance (天然之妙質) manifests itself just as it is. He said, "Focus on one thing without distraction; with reverence straighten the inner (敬以直內), then the vast, flowing Qi (浩然之氣) arises within. Vast and flowing (浩然) – one must truly recognize it; obtaining its firmness and greatness (剛大), straightforward without practice (直不習), there is nothing it does not benefit (無不利)."
(1) The Way of cultivation lies in learning (爲學). Those born with knowledge are few in the world. Generally, to prevent the harm of human desires that obscure one's nature, learning is essential. Learning means studying human affairs below and reaching Heavenly Principle above; it is not merely playing with empty words and frivolous talk. Therefore, he said, "The learner must learn it. One who knows the Way simply advances in virtue (進德). If one has virtue, one does not need practice; there is nothing it does not benefit. There has never been a case of learning to raise children before getting married; it means obtaining this Way beforehand. The effort of studying texts (學文之功) is: learn one matter, it is one matter; learn two matters, they are two matters. Extend by analogy (觸類) to hundreds and thousands; even reaching the exhaustive limit is still just learning." From this, one can see what he meant by learning.
(2) The effort of cultivation lies in forgetting inner and outer. The greatness of Nature transcends inner and outer. Therefore, we should not move the mind but calmly discern right and wrong, not becoming joyful or angry from the self (我), but becoming joyful or angry according to the thing (物). This idea is in the latter half of the "Essay on Stabilizing Nature." It says, "The constancy of Heaven and Earth lies in their mind embracing the myriad things universally without having a [partial] mind (無心). The constancy of the sage lies in his emotions complying with the myriad affairs without having [attached] emotions (無情). Therefore, for the superior man's learning, there is nothing better than being broad and greatly impartial (廓然而大公), responding appropriately when things come (物來而順應)." The Book of Changes says, "Restraining his back, he does not get hold of his person. Walking in his courtyard, he does not see his people (艮其背, 不獲其身, 行其庭, 不見其人)." Mencius said, "What is disliked in wisdom is its forcing (鑿). Rather than rejecting the external and affirming the internal, it is better to forget both the internal and external. <39> When both are forgotten, one becomes clear and tranquil, without affairs (澄然無事). Without affairs, one becomes stable (定). Stable, one becomes clear (明). Clear, how then can responding to things be a burden? The sage's joy is based on the thing's appropriateness for joy; the sage's anger is based on the thing's appropriateness for anger. Thus, the sage's joy and anger are not connected to the mind but connected to the thing." Therefore, the effort of cultivation is all about controlling the subjective emotions of the self (我) and following the objective principle (理) of the other (彼).
(3) The effort of cultivation lies in recognizing Benevolence (識仁). This refers to knowing the absoluteness of Benevolence and then embodying it (體認). Therefore, he said, "The learner must first recognize Benevolence. The benevolent person is holistically unified with things as one body (揮然與物同軆). Righteousness, Propriety, Wisdom are all unified under Benevolence. Once this principle is recognized, preserve it with reverence (敬); that is all. There is no need for restraint (放檢), no need for exhaustive searching (窮索). If the mind slackens, then guard the mind. If it does not slacken, what need is there for guarding? Because principle is not yet obtained, one must exhaustively search. If preserved long enough, it naturally becomes clear. Why wait for exhaustive searching? This Way has no opposite among things; its greatness cannot be named."
(4) Concluding Remarks on the Theory of Cultivation The above four points are merely the main outlines of the cultivation effort. The first two are based on removing evil, [the latter two] on embodying [the good]. Although he learned the method of cultivation from Buddhism (佛家), what makes him different from Buddhism is that in cultivation, he necessarily unified lower-level learning (下學) and higher-level attainment (上達). Buddhism, however, discards the aspect of lower-level learning and merely advocates seeing one's nature (見性) and attaining Buddhahood (成佛). At this point, Buddhist cultivation is useless to society, while Confucian cultivation is beneficial to society.

Conclusion
While Míngdào's philosophy may show no flaws in terms of cultivation (工夫), in terms of theory (理論), it certainly cannot be called successful. This is because his explanation of good and evil existing in nature (性) failed to achieve clarity, correctness, and precision. Next, listing the main points of Míngdào's philosophy, they are as follows: (1) Primordial Qi is Nature; (2) The Mind of the Way is Nature, which is Heavenly Principle. However, the one who supplemented his weak points is said to be Míngdào's younger brother, Yīchuān. The first main point was inherited through Yáng Guīshān (楊龜山) down to Hú Wǔfēng (胡五峯), and the second main point was transmitted to Xiè Shàngcài (謝上蔡) and down to Lù Xiàngshān (陸象山).

Younger Master Cheng (小程子) (Biography and Writings)
Chéng Yīchuān's (程伊川) given name was Yí (頤), and his courtesy name was Zhèngshū (正叔). He was a man of Hénán (河南). Because he resided by the Yī River (伊水), he was called Yīchuān. He was Míngdào's younger brother, possessed high discernment, and did not act contrary to propriety (禮). At the age of 18, he submitted a memorial to the throne (闕下), advising Emperor Rénzōng (仁宗) on the importance of the kingly way (王道). He died in the 9th month of the first year of the Dàguān (大觀) era, at the age of 75. In the 13th year of Jiādìng (嘉定), he was posthumously honored as Duke Zhèng (正公). His written works include the Yì Zhuàn (易傳, Commentary on the Changes) in 4 volumes, Sòng Zhì (宋志, Records of Song?) in 9 volumes, and several dozen contemporary writings (時文). However, the work where his philosophical thought can be seen is only the yǔlù (語錄, recorded sayings). That the learning of the Two Cheng brothers is similar stems from their shared experiences, but one cannot but assume that Yīchuān's source of learning originated from Míngdào. Therefore, amidst the vast Complete Works of the Two Cheng Brothers (二程全書), we intend to discuss only the points where he differs from Míngdào.

Nature (性) and Qi (氣) <40>

Míngdào, while explaining the goodness of nature, attempted to explain the origin of evil but failed, saying, "In the Qi endowment (氣禀) people are born with, principle (理) has good and evil." On this, Yīchuān clearly stated, "Human nature is always good, but Qi has clarity (淸) and turbidity (濁). Those endowed with clear Qi are born as good people, while those endowed with turbid Qi become evil people. Nature is good principle; that there is good and evil pertains to innate capacity (才)." He also said, "Nature comes from Heaven (天), capacity comes from Qi. If Qi is clear, capacity is clear; if Qi is turbid, capacity is turbid. Capacity has good and not-good; nature has nothing that is not good." Furthermore, explaining the universal goodness of nature as being equal in all people, he said, "Nature has nothing that is not good; that there are those who are not good pertains to capacity. Nature is principle (性卽理); principle is the same from Yáo (堯) and Shùn (舜) down to the man on the street. Capacity is endowed by Qi; Qi has clarity and turbidity. Those endowed with its clarity become worthy (賢); those endowed with its turbidity become foolish (愚)." At this point, Nature and Qi become distinct, and the theory of inherent goodness (性善論) can be said to be firmly established.
(1) The Activity of Nature Nature is Principle (理). It is not abstract or formal, but dynamic (力學的). Therefore, Nature is capable of activation (發動). When activated, it is called emotion (情). Nature is absolutely good, but emotions may fail to attain their proper measure (宜). However, one cannot therefore say that emotions are not good. To someone asking about 'nature good, emotions not good,' he replied, "Emotion is the activation of nature; one just needs to return it to correctness (正). How can it be called not good?" If emotion is the activation of nature, its lack of evil is clear. Therefore, emotions must be innately (先天的), neurologically (腦膸的) good.
(2) Nature is Mind (性卽心) Here, Yīchuān reveals that Nature is Mind, saying, "Mencius said, 'He who fully develops his mind knows his nature (盡其心者, 知其性).' Mind is Nature (心卽性也)." Then, the question arises: in what sense do Nature and Mind differ? In response, he said, "In Heaven, it is mandate (命); in righteousness (or principles of things), it is principle (理); in humans, it is nature (性); governing the body, it is mind (心). It is all one." Thus, Mandate, Principle, Nature, and Mind are all nothing but different aspects of the Way (道). The Way is active, the substance (本體) that generates the myriad things. Therefore, Mind cannot but be the substance.
(3) Mind is the Substance Mind is the substance that generates. Therefore, he said, "Mind generates the Way (心生道也). Having this mind, one is equipped with this form to live. The mind of commiseration (惻隱之心) is the Way of human life (人之生道也)." Mind is absolute. Therefore, he also said, "The mind of one person is the mind of Heaven and Earth (一人之心 卽 天地之心)." At this point, Míngdào and Yīchuān are in agreement. Mind, as the substance, is fully equipped with the myriad principles (萬理). At this point, there is also the famous theory of "Vast and Void, Without a Trace" (沖漠無朕說). He said, "Vast and void, without a trace (沖漠無朕), the myriad forms are densely present, already complete (萬象森然己具). Unmanifested (未應), it is not prior; already manifested (已應), it is not posterior. Like a hundred-foot tree, from root to branches and leaves, it is all one continuous flow (一貫). It does not mean that the part above ground, formless and traceless (無形無兆), waits for people to arrange and lead it into the proper path (塗轍)." This means principle is complete in the mind, but it is not internal [only]; it is something to be stepped on and followed. Yet it is not external [only], being vast and void, showing no trace. It is precisely the Way of daily human relations (日常彛倫), from sprinkling and sweeping, responding and receiving, to loyalty (忠), filial piety (孝), and all aspects of the Way.
(4) Knowledge Mind is Principle (理); Qi is that which is below form (形而下), inevitably having limits of size and boundary. <41> The generation of things is the condensation (凝集) of Qi; the destruction of things is the dispersal (披散) of Qi. Therefore, individual principles ultimately reside in Qi. He said, "The names and meanings (名義) of things, along with Qi and Principle, penetrate Heaven and Earth. What makes Heaven Heaven? Originally, what constitutes it? Is it just the azure expanse (蒼蒼)? The reason it is named Heaven is likely the principle of naturalness (自然之理). Names arise from principle; sounds arise from Qi. From this, the universe is inexhaustibly vast (不可勝窮)." Also, his view that the differences among various things arise not from Principle but from the clarity and turbidity of Qi is a most noteworthy point – this is the beginning (濫觴) of Zhū Xī's (朱子) learning.
He distinguished between Principle and Qi, and also posited that in knowledge, there is the knowledge of seeing and hearing (聞見之知, learning and knowing) and the knowledge of virtuous nature (德性之知, silent contemplation and understanding). The so-called knowledge of seeing and hearing belongs to Qi and inevitably has limits, while the knowledge of virtuous nature belongs to Principle and has no distinctions of size, breadth, or narrowness. He said, "The knowledge of seeing and hearing is not the knowledge of virtuous nature. When things interact with things, knowing them is not internal. What is nowadays called broad learning and multiple abilities (博學多能) is this. The knowledge of virtuous nature does not rely on seeing and hearing." Those who hit the mark without effort and attain understanding without thinking do so because they possess this knowledge of virtuous nature.
(5) Concluding Remarks on Nature and Qi Yīchuān definitively asserted that Nature is Principle, stipulated that Qi has clarity and turbidity, clearly distinguished between Nature and Qi, designating Qi as that which is below form and Nature as that which is above form (形而上). However, by stating it is a dynamic reality and identifying it with Mind, he simultaneously formulated the theory of "Vast and Void, Without a Trace." Also, although he stated that Nature is Mind and the substance, its manifestation occurs through pre-existing Qi. Therefore, his philosophical standpoint is dualism (二元論). It is decidedly not the case that a single Mind manifests to generate the myriad things of the universe. This is where he differs from Míngdào; Míngdào's philosophy was monism (一元論), where Nature is Primordial Qi.

Theory of Cultivation (工夫論)
(1) Cultivation lies in nurturing Qi. Since Yīchuān held that Qi has clarity and turbidity, the purpose of cultivation lies in rectifying the turbid aspect. He said, "Qi has clarity and turbidity, while Nature has no lack of goodness. Mencius's nurturing the vast, flowing Qi (養浩然之氣) is nurturing this. When the utmost point is reached, one becomes clear, bright, pure, and complete (淸明純全), removing the evil of obstruction (昏塞)." If so, where does the method for nurturing this lie? He said, "In diminishing desires (寡欲)."
(2) The effort of cultivation lies in the investigation of principle (窮理). Yīchuān believed, "Only after accumulating the investigation of principle can one suddenly achieve understanding (脫然了悟). It is impossible to say that focusing on just one matter completes the effect of investigating principle." Yīchuān explained this idea numerous times, showing it to be his fundamental thought. He divided the method of investigating principle into three: "First, reading books to clarify meanings and principles (義理). Second, discussing figures of ancient and modern times to distinguish their right and wrong (是非). Third, handling affairs and responding to situations appropriately (處其當)." This differs from Míngdào's approach. Because it belongs to the knowledge of seeing and hearing, Xiàngshān (象山, Lu Jiuyuan) extremely opposed it. <42>
(3) The effort of cultivation lies in true knowledge (眞識). Knowledge from the ears and eyes (耳目之識) is insufficient to generate action (行). Only after truly understanding in the mind (心) can one begin to manifest it in action. A person who has once suffered the injury of being bitten by a tiger will suddenly change color even upon hearing the name 'tiger.' However, one who has not yet felt the pain of being bitten does not experience the same sudden, drastic change in expression (神色) as the injured person. The true knowledge (眞知) of the learner is also like this. Generally, those who act by forcing themselves (勉强) to conform to the Way can definitely not continue for long. Human nature is originally good; acting according to principle is natural (順).
(4) The essential point of cultivation lies in sitting meditation and entering stillness (坐禪入定). The primary task for the learner lies in the mind and will (心志). Even if one wishes to employ seeing, hearing, knowing, and thinking simultaneously, it is certainly impossible. Only when thoughts are disordered (思慮紛亂) must one practice sitting meditation and enter stillness. The clarity (明) of my mind is like a mirror (鑑); there is nothing with which it does not interact, and consequently, it cannot but engage in thought (思慮). If one wishes to avoid this, one only needs the master (主) of the mind. What is called the master is reverence (敬); reverence means focusing on one thing without distraction (主一無適). The human mind cannot be used for two things at once. If one trains in focusing on one thing without distraction now, the affliction of disordered thoughts will naturally disappear. What the Book of Changes calls "straightening the inner with reverence, squaring the outer with righteousness (敬以直內, 義以方外)" refers to this. Straightening the inner is the meaning of focusing on one; not being hasty, not being lax (不期不慢), having nothing to be ashamed of even under the stars and dew (星漏不愧) – all are matters of reverence. Simply preserving this reverence and nurturing it (涵養), Heavenly Principle will naturally become clear. In this, there is no difference from Elder Cheng (大程).
(5) Concluding Remarks on the Theory of Cultivation Following the theoretical differences between Míngdào and Yīchuān, their methods of cultivation also naturally differ. Míngdào, being a monist, held that the One Origin is the Mind of the Way (道心); removing the evil from this Mind of the Way is the purpose of cultivation effort. Yīchuān, being a dualist, held the two origins to be the co-equal Nature and Qi. Because Qi possesses turbidity, he saw the necessity of investigating principle. Therefore, Míngdào can be called enlightenment-oriented (悟脫的), while Yīchuān can be called investigation-oriented (窮理的).

Conclusion
Yīchuān inherited Míngdào's philosophy and established the dualism of Nature and Qi. This was then inherited and developed through Zhū Xī (朱子). In his theory of cultivation, on the one hand, he advocated the investigation of principle, which became one cause for the rise of Xiàngshān's philosophy. On the other hand, he advocated the theory of the unity of knowledge and action (知行合一論), thereby inducing the philosophy of Wáng Yángmíng (王陽明).

Successors of Cheng Learning
(1) Those emphasizing the Mind (心學) - Xiè Shàngcài (謝上蔡)... (Míngdào's style of learning)
(2) Those emphasizing the character 'Nature' (性字) - Yáng Guīshān (楊龜山)... (Yīchuān's style of learning)

A. Xiè Shàngcài (謝上蔡)
Xiè Shàngcài's given name was Liángzuǒ (良佐), courtesy name Xiǎndào (顯道). He was from Shàngcài (上蔡) in Shòuchūn (壽春), hence called Master Shàngcài (上蔡先生). <43> He was firm, bright, sincere, and honest, and Míngdào greatly praised his character.
Fundamental Thought Shàngcài's learning received Míngdào's simple and direct style (簡易學風), taking the single character 'Mind' (心) as its center, and sought to develop this center through the investigation of principle. Therefore, discussing the mind, he said, "What is the mind? Benevolence (仁) is it. What is Benevolence? That which is alive (活者) is Benevolence; that which is dead (死者) is lack of Benevolence (不仁)." This is no different from Míngdào calling Benevolence Primordial Qi, Nature, and the Mind of the Way. Continuing, he said, "If a person nowadays does not know numbness (痲痺) or pain/itch (痛痒) in their limbs (耳軆 - likely error for 肢體, limbs?), this would be called 'insensitivity/lack of benevolence' (不仁). If the pit (核) of a peach or apricot is planted and can sprout, it is called 'peach kernel' (桃仁) or 'apricot kernel' (杏仁); this means 'life' (生). Extending this, one can see [the meaning of] Benevolence." As such, calling the Mind Benevolence and explaining Benevolence concretely resulted in making one perceive one's own greatness (尊大). What obscures one's own greatness is human desire; the effort to remove this is divided between Confucianism (儒) and Buddhism (佛). Buddhism speaks of seeing one's nature (見性), stopping at knowing what nature is. Then how does Confucianism sweep away human desires? He says it lies solely in the investigation of principle. Although principles are manifold (萬殊), they ultimately have a unifying, synthesizing source (統一總腦). Therefore, if one investigates the great ones, there will naturally be something that penetrates through. How could one investigate each and every one? This is where Xièzǐ (謝子, Master Xie) diverges from Míngdào and approaches Buddhist enlightenment (佛門悟入). However, unlike Buddhism, he does not entirely discard the effort of lower-level learning; his so-called investigation of principle simply requires true knowledge (眞知). In short, Shàngcài interpreted Benevolence concretely, calling it Mind and Heaven, thereby making Mind the center of his learning. From his statement, "Buddhism's discussion of Nature is like Confucianism's discussion of Mind (佛之論性 如儒之論心)," one can know how greatly he valued the Mind. As a result of valuing the Mind so highly, he arrived at the theory of the unity of knowledge and action (知行合一說) and, following that, esteemed liberation (解脫), ultimately transcending the bounds of the Sage's gate (聖門). Thus, this trend of thought is smoothly the forerunner (先驅) of Lù's learning (陸學, Lu Jiuyuan).

B. Yáng Guīshān (楊龜山)
Guīshān's given name was Shí (時), courtesy name Zhōnglì (中立). He was from Jiānglè (將樂) in Nánjiàn (南劒). His nature was extremely intelligent and perceptive (聰悟), warm in countenance, gentle and yielding (溫容婉柔), and Yīchuān loved him most. He died in the 5th year of Shàoxīng (紹興) at the age of 83 (error in text, likely meant 83, born 1053, died 1135; 23 is impossible). His posthumous name was Wénjìng (文靖). His written works include Sānjīng Yìbiàn (三經義辨, Discernment of Meanings in the Three Classics), Yǔlù (語錄, Recorded Sayings), Guīshān Jí (龜山集, Collected Works of Guishan), etc. Guīshān is called the founding ancestor (始祖) of Luò learning (洛學, the Cheng school) because of the historical connection through Luó Cóngyuán (羅從源) to Lǐ Yánpíng (李延平), finally reaching [Zhū] Xī (未子 - likely error for 朱子, Zhu Xi).
(1) Identity of Reverence (敬) and Righteousness (義) When one straightens the inner with reverence, what manifests outwardly is naturally righteousness. Reverence and righteousness are not separate things. "Where there is reverence, there must be righteousness; where there is righteousness, there must be reverence." There is merely the distinction between inner and outer and the division between root (本) and branch (末).
(2) Guīshān believed, "From the sage's sincerity of intent (誠意) and rectification of the mind (正心) to governing the state and bringing peace to the world (治國平天下), the principle is one. It cannot be established separately for inner and outer. Also, if one sees the sincerity of intent and rectification of the mind, one will see that the world is brought to peace thereby."
(3) Nature is Good Yángzǐ (楊子, Master Yang) compared Buddhism and [Confucianism on] the goodness/evil of nature, saying: In Buddhism, saying nature is true emptiness (性眞空) means departing from humanity; departing from humanity is what is called <44> obstinate emptiness (頑空通 - typo for 頑空?). Saying the eighth, Amalā consciousness (第八庵摩羅識), is empty, white, pure, and undefiled (虛空白淨無垢) and the ninth, Ālaya consciousness (第九阿賴耶識), contains the seeds of good and evil (善惡之種子) – the white, pure, and undefiled is precisely Mencius's inherent goodness (性善). However, among Yáng Guīshān's disciples, the only ones worthy of note are Hú Wǔfēng (胡五峯) and Luó Yùzhāng (羅豫章, Luo Congyuan).

One. Hú Wǔfēng (胡五峯)
(Biography and Writings)
Hú Wǔfēng's given name was Hóng (宏), courtesy name Rénzhòng (仁仲). Scholars called him Master Wǔfēng (五峯先生). His written works include Zhī Yán (知言, Knowing Words), Shī Wén (詩文, Poetry and Prose), and Huáng Wáng Dà Jì (皇王大紀, Great Annals of Emperors and Kings).

(a) Nature and Mind Húzǐ (胡子, Master Hu) said, "The sage, pointing to the substance (軆) of the Way, called it Nature (性), and pointing to its function (用), called it Mind (心). Nature cannot but move; when it moves, it becomes Mind." Thus, Húzǐ considered Mind to be active, distinguishing it from Nature, and regarded only Nature as quiescent (靜).
(b) Nature is Absolute Good. In Míngdào's theory, Nature was called Primordial Qi. From this, Guīshān compared inherent goodness to the Amalā [consciousness] and good/evil to the Ālaya consciousness. That is, the idea of Nature being absolute good was included therein. Wǔfēng also accepted this theory, saying, "Nature is the profundity (奧) of Heaven, Earth, ghosts, and spirits (天地鬼神)." If even 'good' is insufficient to describe it, how much less 'evil'? Furthermore, citing his late honored father's (先君子) words, he said, "When Mencius spoke of the goodness of nature, it was an expression of admiration (歎美之辭), definitely not contrasted with evil." This is because it is absolute goodness. What is the meaning of saying Nature is absolute good? It is because it enables things to be content with their fixed allotment (定分). His words say, "Perfect indeed! I observe the spiritual way (神道) of Heaven and Earth: its timing is without error (其時無愆); endowing forms upon the myriad things, whether great or small, each fulfills its allotment (各足其分). Great harmony (大和) is preserved and united (保合), transformations are endless (變化無窮). The life of all humans is purely the mind of Heaven and Earth (粹然天地之心); the Way and righteousness are fully complete (道義究具), without partiality or aversion (無適無莫). It cannot be distinguished by good and evil, cannot be divided by right and wrong. There is no excess (無過), no deficiency (無不及). This is why 'Mean' (中) is its name." This passage is sufficient to clearly see his theory of absolute inherent goodness.
(c) Mind is Undying. Mind presides over the activation of Nature. Therefore, failing to accord with the mean (中節) lies with the Mind. If so, by what standard should the Mind be sought? He says one must rely solely on the good mind (良心). This is the extremely sensitive faculty (機敏한 機關) in humankind that can discern right/wrong and deviant/correct (是非邪正). Therefore, he said, "All people have a good mind. If branded with the names of Jié (桀) and Zhòu (紂, tyrants), even a common man would not accept it." Thus, the center of Húzǐ's philosophy is precisely the Mind. From esteeming this Mind, Húzǐ said, "The Mind has no death or birth (心無死生)," and also believed, "Do not observe the mind with form, but observe the mind with the mind, then you will know it (無以形觀心而以心觀心則知之矣)." In other words, it is nothing but saying the Mind is without birth and death, while form has birth and death.
(d) Conclusion. In summary, Mind is an active entity, and its manifestations in action are sometimes good, sometimes evil. Following the good mind leads to good; letting it go leads to evil. Húzǐ's philosophy has the feel of being close to common sense, but it possesses considerable <45> analytical clarity.

Two. Lǐ Yánpíng (李延平)
Lǐ Yánpíng's given name was Tóng (侗 - text has 伺, likely error for 侗), courtesy name Yuànchōng (愿中 - text has 愿, likely abbreviation for 愿中). He was from Nánjiàn (南釰 - likely error for 南劍, Nanping). At the age of 24, hearing that Luó Zhòngsù (羅仲素, Luo Congyuan) was transmitting the learning of Hé-Luò (河洛, the Cheng school), he went to study under him. Zhòngsù's character was inherently not seeking fame in the world. The Master (Lǐ Yánpíng) alone deeply resonated (深契) with this, withdrew into seclusion (退屛), and declined worldly affairs for over 40 years. Though his basket and gourd were often empty (簞瓢屢空), he was content and at ease (怡然自適). His self-mastery (操存) was firm, his nurturing cultivation (涵養) grew ever deeper (益熱 - likely error for 益熟, more mature?), and his actions all hit the mean (發而皆中節). He died in the 10th month of the first year of Lóngxīng (隆興), at the age of 71 (born 1093, died 1163). His written works can be seen appended to the Yánpíng Wèndá (延平問答, Questions and Answers of Yanping) and the Zhūzǐ Yǔlù (朱子語錄, Recorded Sayings of Zhu Xi), etc.

a. Fundamental Thought The primary principle (第一義) of Yánpíng's learning lies in sitting quietly with closed eyes (靜坐瞑目), embodying Heavenly Principle (天理を體認), and seeking the Mean (中) within, before joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure have arisen (喜怒哀樂未發). After obtaining the Mean, nurturing its application (發用) is the first rule of the method of cultivation (涵養). He said, "The Way of inquiry (問之道) does not lie in much talk. Just sit silently, clarify the mind (黙坐澄心), and embody Heavenly Principle. If so, even the arising of a single strand of selfish desire (私欲) will also retreat. Exerting effort in this for a long time, one may gradually approach clarity; lecturing on learning then begins to have power." Zhū Xī also said, "Master Yánpíng taught people quiet sitting (靜坐)." From this, one can clearly see that his method of learning was close to Chán (禪, Zen) meditation.
b. Influence on Zhū Xī When Zhū Xī was 24, he met Yánpíng and volubly expounded his own learning. The Master said, "You speak so much, but you do not understand the matter right before you (面前之事)." In response, Zhū Xī suddenly reflected and immediately realized the insufficiency of his own learning. (End of Lǐ Yánpíng) <46>

**Summary**

This article, part of a series on Eastern Moral Philosophy, details the Neo-Confucian philosophy of the Cheng brothers, Cheng Hao (Mingdao) and Cheng Yi (Yichuan), and their immediate successors. It outlines Mingdao's monistic view of Nature (性) as Primordial Qi (元氣) and Benevolence (仁) as its dynamic expression, emphasizing self-cultivation (工夫) through reverence (敬) and recognizing Benevolence. It then contrasts this with Yichuan's dualistic system, separating Principle (理, inherent goodness) from Qi (氣, physical endowment which can be clear or turbid, explaining evil), and advocating cultivation through investigating principle (窮理) and nurturing Qi. The article traces the lineage: Mingdao's emphasis on Mind (心) influencing Xie Shangcai and eventually Lu Xiangshan (School of Mind), while Yichuan's focus on Nature/Principle influenced Yang Guishan, Hu Wufeng, Li Yanping, and ultimately Zhu Xi (School of Principle). From a colonial history perspective, this detailed engagement with Neo-Confucianism in a 1921 Korean magazine highlights the continued relevance and intellectual exploration of traditional East Asian thought systems by Korean intellectuals during Japanese rule. It suggests an effort to understand and potentially reclaim a distinct philosophical heritage amidst pressures of modernization and foreign domination, serving perhaps as a source of cultural identity or an alternative intellectual framework to those being imposed or imported.

東洋道學의 軆系如何
						姜春山 記
大程子
叙論(傳幷書)
程顥의 字는 伯淳이니 河南人이라. 父 程珦은 官이 太中太夫에 至하니라. 伯淳은 明道元年에 生하니 幼하야 能言치 못한 바 叔母-此를 抱하고 行하다가 釵을 不覺中에 見墜한지라 後數日에 此를 求한대 先生이 手로 指하거늘 指하는 所에 隨往하니 果然 釵-有하니라. 15歲時에 弟 伊川과 共히 周茂叔에게 就하야 學하고 此로부터 慨然히 科擧의 業을 厭하고 求道할 志를 두엇다 하니라. 元豐8年 6月 15日에 卒하니 年이 54라. 文彦博이 그 墓表에 題하야 明道라 하다. 그의 詩文 數十篇의 外에 其他는 別無하고 其說을 見할만한 者는 오즉 語錄이 有하니라.

그의 學統
孔子의 思想은 論語에 在한 바 그 思想의 中心點은 自己 人格을 完成함에 在하다. 卽 先王治國의 道를 實行할만한 人格을 養成함에 在하느니라. 孔子-沒하매 孟子-獨히 斯學을 繼述하다 宋代에 學術이 勃興함과 共히 邵子-有하며 周子-有하야 皆哲學家로써 有名하엿스나 皆孔子의 意를 得한 與否는 不明한 中 能히 孔子의 意를 得한 者는 程明道其人이라 할지로다. 伊川이 明道의 行狀을 作하야 曰 『先生이 生于千四百年之後得不傳之學於遺經』이라 云함이 適當하도다. 明道의 哲學은 純正哲學이 아니오 修身學에 在하다. 此는 倫理에 疎하고 實踐을 重히 함으로써라.

倫理論
(1) 仁은 卽 元氣  明道는 性善을 孔子와 調和키 爲하야 甚히 苦腦하얏나니 諸家를 歷問하야 此를 釋코저 하엿도다. 當時 그 思想이 아즉 未定하엿스나 『反求諸六經而得之』＜37＞라 稱하얏스니 六經이라 함은 즉 禮樂詩書易春秋-是니라. 孔子는 一個의 仁을 主張하니 仁의 德됨은 名狀키 不可하야 其大-無外하고 其小-無內라 易에  云한 바 『天地의 大德을 生이라』하니 故로 仁은 即 生이라. 此生은 一元의 氣에 由하야 成行되나니 易에 曰  『乾元된 者-資하야 始한다』하며 一元의 氣는 卽 仁되지 아님이 不可하니 仁 卽 善치 아님이 不可하다. 故로 易에 曰 『元者는 善之長이라. 人物이 皆此 一元의 氣를 受하야 生長하나니 故로 그 性이 善치 안흘리- 無하다』하엿도다. 明道-以爲하되 仁은 即 元氣임으로써 善하다 하엿스니 是 即 彼가 線의 基礎를 得하야 荀子를 凌駕하고 孔과 孟을 調和한 바라 하노라. 彼의 一世談說이 畢竟 此에 歸치 아님이 無하니라.
(2) 性은 即 元氣  此가 前諸子에 比하야 大히 異한 바 明道의 性說에 最히 主義할 價値가 有한 바니라. 曰 『生之謂性, 性卽氣, 氣卽性, 生之謂也』라 하니 性 即 氣의 一語는 前欸에 論述한 바의 元氣-是니라. 故로 性은 善하다 한다. 又曰 『人이 氣稟으로 生한 以上은 理에 善惡이 無키 不能하나 然하나 性中에 元初兩物이 相對하야 生함이 아니라 幼로부터 善함이 有하고 惡함이 有함은 有-氣稟의 自然일 것 뿐이오 善은 本來 是性이 됨과 同時에 惡도 亦 性이라 謂치 아님이 不可하다』하엿스니 然則明道는 性論이 不完全하도다.
(3) 性은 絶對  性은 이미 元氣니 元氣는 宇宙間에 充盈한 者라 그 絶對됨은 論을 不俟할지로다. 此觀念을 基底로 하고 所謂定性書 一篇을 稿하니라. 그 性의 絶對를 論함에 曰 『所謂定』이라 함은 動도 亦 定, 靜도 亦 定,  將迎도 無하고 內外도 無하니 苟外物로써 外라 하야 己를 産하야 此에 從할 時는 是己가 性으로 內外가 有타 함이로다.
(4) 仁은 絶對  仁은 元氣 即 性됨으로써 그 絶對됨은 再言을 不得함지라. 但 性은 元氣를 靜的으로 觀하고 仁은 元氣를 的으로 觀함에 不外하니 彼의 識仁篇은 此 觀念을 基底로 하고 論한 者라. 그 仁의 絶對를 論함에 曰 『仁은 渾然하야 物과 軆를 同包하니 義禮智信이 皆仁이라』하고 又 醫家의 比喩로써 說하야 曰 『醫書의  手足痿痺가 즉 不仁이라』하니 此言이 最히 善名이라 謂치 아니치 못하리로다. 仁者는 天地萬物로써 一軆가 되니 己-아님이 無하야 手足이 不仁할 時는 全身軆의 氣亦 貫通치 못하야 己에 屬치 아니하나니 故로 『博施濟衆은 聖人의 功用이라』한다. 然則 仁이 一貫的 宇宙의 絶對되는 意-此에서 見할지로다. 二程의 語仁을 說한 者-凡數10條에 1도 斯意-아님이 無하도다.＜38＞
(5) 心 宇宙乾元의 氣는 性이니 即 仁이라. 故로 形은 道되지 아니치 못할지라. 曰 『道卽性, 若道外尋性, 性外尋道, 便不是聖賢論天德』이라 하다. 然하면 彼의 心에 관한 見解는 如何한가 問하면 卽 人心, 道心의 別이 有한 者라 할지라. 道心은 그 本性으로 言卽天理라 天理는 卽 道니 唯人欲이 蔽할 時는 天德을 忘함에 至하는 故로 人欲을 除할 時는 心卽天理가 되나니 凡心은 活動的 物이라. 그 存在에서 力學的이 되지 아니치 못할지니 今明道所謂天理는 性으로 卽 元氣니 心도 亦 元氣로써 力學的 實在라 하나니라.
倫倫倫理論의 結言 天地의 生氣를 仁이라 하고 人에 在하얀 此를 性, 道, 道心이라 하니 故로 道心은 人으로써는 同치 아님이 無하고 聖人의 傳한 바 斯心에서 出처 아님이 無하니 此卽絶對로써 그 天眞을 發揮하는 바 法은 如左하다.

그의 工夫論
修爲의 工夫는 主一無適에 在함. 各人의 性은 本是 圓滿具足한 者니 孟子 所謂 『萬物皆備於我』의 言이 果然하다. 오즉 그 人欲이 過蔽함으로 그 本來의 善性이 自己의 光明을 發揮함을 不得하나니 故로 修爲의 工夫는 人慾을 去하고 홀로 公共의 道心만 存케 함에 在할뿐이다. 然卽 그 法은 오즉 敬으로써 心을 治함에 在하니라. 敬할 時는 天然의 妙質이 그대로 發現되나니 曰 『主一無適, 敬以直, 內便有浩然之氣, 浩然, 湏要實識, 得他剛大, 直不習, 無不利』라 하니라.
(1) 修爲의 道는 爲學에 在함.  生하야 知하는 者는 世에 其人이 少하다. 大抵 그 性을 蔽하는 人欲의 害를 防코저 하면 即 爲學의 必用이 是라. 爲學이라 함은 下로 人事를 學하고 上으로 天理에 到達함이니 한갓 空文浮言을 弄함은 아니라. 故로 曰 『學者湏學之, 知道者進德而已, 有德則不習, 無不利, 未有學養子而後嫁, 盖先得是道矣, 學文之功, 學得一事, 是一事, 二事, 是二事, 觸類, 至于百千, 至窮盡, 亦只是學』이라 하니 此로써 그 所謂 爲學의 何者됨을 可見하겟도다.
(2) 修爲의 工夫는 內外를 忘함에 在함.  性의 大-內外를 絶하니 故로 吾人은 心을 動치 勿하고 靜的으로 是非를 洞察하야 我로써 喜怒치 勿하고 物로써 喜怒할지니 此意는 定性書後半에 在하니라. 曰 『夫天地之常以其心普萬物而無心, 聖人之常, 以其情順萬事而無情, 故, 君子之學, 莫若廓然而大公, 物來而順應』이라 하고 易에 曰 『艮其背, 不獲其身, 行其庭, 不見其人』이라 하며 孟子 曰 『所惡於智者爲鑿也, 與其非外而是內, 不若內外之兩忘,＜39＞ 兩忘則澄然無事, 無事則定, 定則明, 明則尙何應物之爲累哉, 聖人之喜, 以物之當喜, 聖人之怒, 以物之當怒, 是, 聖人之喜怒, 不係於心而係於物』이라 하엿도다. 然則修爲의 工夫는 皆我의 主觀的 되는 情을 制하야 彼의 客觀的 되는 理에 隨由하는 所以니라.
(3) 修爲의 工夫는 仁을 識함에 在함. 此는 仁의 絶對되는 事를 知하고 後에 此를 軆認함을 謂함이라. 故로 曰  『學者須先識仁, 仁者揮然與物同軆, 義禮智, 皆統於仁識得此理, 以識敬存之而已, 不湏放檢, 不湏窮索, 若心懈則有防心, 苟不懈, 何防之有, 理有未得故, 湏窮索存久自明, 安待窮素, 此道與物無對, 其大, 不足以名之』로다.
(4) 工夫論의 終言 以上 四者는 工夫의 綱領뿐이니 前 二者는 去邪를 基하고 體認을 基하니라. 彼가 修爲法을  佛家에서 學得하야 反히 佛家와 相異함은 修爲에 在하야 下學과 上達을 必然的으로 同一케 하엿스나 佛家는 下學의 一條를 廢하고 但見性 成佛만 唱導하니 此點에서 佛家의 修爲는 社會에 無益하고 儒家의 修爲는 社會에 有益하니라.

結論
明道의 哲學은 工夫의 方面으로는 破綻을 見치 못하겟스나 理論의 方面으로는 決코 成功하엿다 謂키 不可하니 卽 性에 善惡이 有한 바 說이 明正精確함을 得치 못함으로써-라. 次에 明道哲學의 主要한 點을 擧하면 左와 如하니 (1)元氣는 卽 性이라 함이요 (2)道心은 卽性卽天理라 함이로다. 然한데 그 弱點을 補한 者는 明道의 弟 伊川이라 한다. 第一主點을 繼紹한 者는 楊龜山을 經하야 胡五峯에 至하고 第二主點을 繼紹한 者는 謝上蔡에 傳하야 陸象山에 至하엿나니라.

小程子(傳幷書)
程伊川의 名은 頣요 字는 正叔이니 河南人이라. 伊水上에 在한 故로 伊川이라 하다. 明道의 弟니 高識이 有하야 禮-아니면 動치 아니하고 18歲時에 闕下에 上書하야 仁宗으로 하여곰 王道의 重大함을 勸하니라. 大觀元年 9月에 卒하니 年이 75라. 嘉定 13年에 謚하야 正公이라 하며 其著한 바 易傳 4卷, 宋志 9卷, 時文 數十篇이 有하나 그의 哲學思想을 可見할만한 者는 但 語錄뿐이다. 二程學問이 相同한 者는 그 經歷이 同함에 歸한 者로되 伊川의 學源을 不可不明道에게 淵源하엿다고 假定치 아니치 못할지라. 故로 吾人은 浩澣한 二程全書中에 就하야 오즉 明道와 相異한 點만 論코저 하노라.

性과 氣＜40＞

明道는 性善을 說明함과 共히 그 惡의 由來를 說明코저 하다가 失敗한 바 曰 『人生氣禀, 理有善惡』이라 하엿나니 此에 伊川이 明言하야 曰 『人性은 皆善하나 但 氣에 淸과 濁이 有하니 淸氣를 禀한 者는 生하야 善人이 되고 濁氣를 禀한 者는 惡人이 되나니라. 性은 善理로써 善惡이 有함은 卽才라』하고 又曰 『性出於天, 才出於氣, 氣淸則才淸, 氣濁則才濁, 才則有善, 有不善, 性則無不善』이라 하다. 更히 性의 普遍的 善으로써 各人에 平等한 바를 說하야 曰 『性無不善而有不善者才也, 性卽理, 理則自堯舞, 至於途人一也, 才禀於氣, 氣有淸濁, 禀其淸者爲賢, 禀其濁者爲愚』라 하니라. 此에 至하야 性과 氣는 分明하야 性善論이 必定하엿다 할지로다.
(1) 性의 動  性은 卽 理니 抽象的, 形式的이 아니요 力學的이니라. 故로 性은 發動할만한 者니 發動할 時는 此를 情이라 한다. 性은 絶對 善하나 情은 그 宜를 得키 不能하니라. 然이나 此로써 情은 不善이라 云키 不可하다. 或 人이 性善情不善의 問에 對하야 『情者는 性動也, 要歸之正而已, 亦何得以不善名之』아 하엿스니 情으로써 性의 動이라 하면 그 不善이 無함은 明白하니라. 然則 情은 先天的 腦膸的으로 善치 아님이 不可하도다.
(2) 性卽心  伊川은 玆에 至하야 性卽心이라 道破하니 曰 『孟子曰 盡其心者, 知其性, 心卽性也』라 하얏다. 然則性과 心은 如何한 意味에서 相異한가? 함이 疑問이라 此에 對하야 曰 『在天爲命, 在義爲理, 在人爲性主於身爲心一也』라 하다. 然하면 命,理,性,心이 皆道의 異方面에 不外한 바 道는 即 活動的이라 萬物을 生成하는 바의 本體인 故로 心은 本體가 되지아님이 不可하도다.
(3) 心은 本體니라  心은 생성하는 바의 본체니 고로 曰 『心生道也, 有是心, 卽具是形以生, 惻隱之心, 人之生道也』라 하며 心은 絶對니라. 고로 又曰 『一人之心 卽 天地之心』이라 하니 此點에서 卽 明道·伊川이 一致하엿다 하겟도다. 心은 本體로써 萬理를 具備하니라. 此點에서 又 有名한 沖漠無朕說이 有하니 曰 『沖漠無朕, 萬象森然己具, 未應, 不是先, 已應不是後, 如百尺之木, 自根本, 至枝葉, 皆是一貫, 不合道上面一段事, 無形無兆却待人旋安排, 引入來, 敎入塗轍』이라 하니 盖理는 心에 備하얏스나 內가 아니라 踏하야 行할만 하고 又外가 아니라 沖漠하야 痕跡을 見할만한 者-無함으로써라. 即 日常彛倫의 道로써 洒, 掃, 應待로부터 忠孝一切의 道에 至하기까지 皆是니라.
(4) 知識  心은 理요 氣는 形而下니 大小限界가 有함을＜41＞不免할지라. 物의 生함은 氣의 凝集이요 物의 滅함은 氣의 披散이라. 故로 個別原理는 畢竟 氣에 在하니 曰 『物之名義與氣, 理通, 貫天地所以爲天, 本何爲栽 蒼蒼爲耳矣, 其所以名之曰天, 盖自然之理也, 名出於理, 音出於氣 宇宙由是而不可勝窮』이라하다. 又彼가 氣에 淸濁이 有함으로써 各物의 差別은 理가 아니요 氣에 在하다함은 最히 可觀할 點이니 此-朱子學의 濫觴이로다.
彼가 理와 氣를 區別하야 知識에도 亦聞見(學而知之)의 知와 德性(黙念而通)의 知가 有하다 하엿나니 所謂 聞見의 智는 氣에 屬하야 限이 有함을 不免하고 德性의 知는 理에 屬하야 大小 廣狹이 有한 事-無하니 曰 『聞見之智, 非德性之智, 物交物則知之非內也, 今之所謂博學多能者是也, 德性之智不假聞見』이라 하엿다. 所謂 勉치 안코 中하며 思치 안코 得하는 者는 此德性의 智가 有함으로써라.
(5) 性氣의 結言  伊川이 性卽理라 斷言하야 氣에 淸濁이 有하다 規定하고 性과 氣의 區別을 截然케 하야 氣로써 形而下라 하고 性으로써 形而上이라 하엿다. 然이나 力學的 實在가 된다 하야 此를 心과 同一케 함과 同時에 冲漠無朕說을 成하니라. 又 性卽心이며 本體라 하엿스나 그 發現은 旣存한 氣를 通하야 遂成됨으로써 그 哲學的 立脚地는 二元論이니 決코 唯一의 心이 發現하야써 宇宙萬物을 生成하엿다 함이 아니라 此가 明道와  異한 바-니 明道의 哲學은 性으로써 卽 元氣가 된다한 바의 一元論이니라.

工夫論
(1) 修爲는 氣를 養함에 在함.  伊川은 氣의 淸濁이 有하다한 故로 修爲의 目的은 그 濁한 者를 修治함에 在하니 曰 『氣에 淸濁이 有하고 性은 卽 不善이 無하다. 孟子의 養浩然之氣는 此를 養함이니 至極의 點에 達하면 淸明純全하야 昏塞한 바의 惡을 去한다』하다. 然하면 此를 養하는 바 法은 何에 在한가? 曰 『寡欲』이라 하니라.
(2) 修爲의 工夫는 窮理에 在함.  伊川이 以爲하되 『窮理를 積하면 然後에 脫然하야 了할 바-有하니 一個의 事에만 着目하야 窮理의 效를 終한다 함이 不可하다』하엿스니 伊川이 此意를 說한 바-凡數回에 그의 根本思想임을 可知하겟다. 窮理의 法을 分하야 3이라 하니 『一曰 書를 讀하야 義理를 講明함이요 二曰 古今人物을 論하야 그 是非를 別함이요 三曰 事物應接하야 其當에 處함』이라. 是明道의 趣旨와 異한 바-니 그 聞見이 知에 屬함으로써 象山이 極히 反對하니라.＜42＞
(3) 修爲의 工夫는 眞識에 在함.  耳目의 識은 行의 發함에 不足하니 眞히 心에 知了한 後에야 비롯오 行에 發함을 得할지로다. 一次虎에게 嚙牙의 害를 蒙한 人은 虎의 名을 聞하고도 顔色이 忽變하나 尙히 嚙牙의 痛傷을 感치안는 者는 傷者와 如히 神色이 忽然 激變치 아니하도다. 學者의 眞知도 亦斯와 如하야 大抵 勉强하야  道에 合코저 行動하는 者는 決코 -永續키 不能하니라. 人의 性이 本善하니 理에 循하야 行함이 順하니라.
(4) 修爲의 要는 坐禪入定에 在함  學者의 先務는 心志에 在하니 聞見知思를 幷出코저 하여도 3固不可하다. 오즉 思慮의 紛亂이 有할 時는 반듯이 坐禪入定할지니 我心의 明은 鑑과 如하야 萬物의 交感치 아님이 無하고  隨하야 此로써 思慮케 안할 事-不能하니 若此를 免코저 하면 唯心의 主를 要할 뿐이다. 所謂 主라 함은 敬이요 敬은 主一無適을 云함이니 人心은 二用키 不可하도다. 今主一無適을 習鍊하면 即 思慮紛亂의 患이 自然 消滅할지니 易에 所謂 『敬以直內, 義以方外』라 한 者-是니라. 直內는 主一의 義니 不期不慢하야 星漏不愧가 皆敬의 事니라. 但 此敬을 存하야 涵養할 時는 自然히 天理가 明한다 하니 此는 大程과 異한 事-無하니라.
(5) 工夫論의 結言  明道·伊川이 理論의 相異함에 從하야 修爲의 工夫도 自異하나니 明道는 一元論인 바 그 一元은 即 道心이니 此道心의 邪惡을 除排함은 修爲工夫의 目的이요 伊川은 二元論인 바 그 二元은 對等적인 性과 氣니라. 氣에 濁함이 有한 故로 窮理의 必要를 見하니라. 然한즉 明道는 悟脫的이요 伊川은 窮理的이라 할만 하도다.

結論
伊川은 明道철학을 繼하야 性氣의 二元을 建設하니 是則 朱子를 由하야 繼紹開發된 者니라. 修爲論에 一方으로는 窮理를 主張하야 象山哲學을 勃起케 한 一原因이라 하겟고 又一方으로는 知行合一論을 唱하야 王陽明哲學을  誘起케 하니라.

程學의 後繼
(1) 心學에 重을 措한 者-謝上蔡...(明道의 學風)
(2) 性字에 重을 措한 者-楊龜山...(伊川의 學風)

甲. 謝上蔡
謝上蔡의 名은 良佐요 字는 顯道니 壽春上蔡人이라 故로 上蔡先生이라＜43＞ 稱하다. 剛明誠實하야 明道가 頗히 其人됨을 讚하니라.
根本思想  上蔡의 學은 明道의 簡易學風을 受하야 心 一字로써 中心을 삼고 窮理에 由하야 此中心을 開發코저 하엿나니. 고로 其心을 論함에 曰 『心者何也 仁是己 仁者何也 活者爲仁 死者爲不仁』이라 하엿스니 此-明道의 仁으로써 元氣라 하고 性이라 하며 道心이라 함과 異치 아니한 바 更히 語를 繼하야 曰 『今人이 耳軆의 痲痺痛痒을 不知하면 此를 不仁이라 謂할지라. 桃杏의 核를 種하야 生할만한 者면 此를 桃仁, 杏仁이라 謂하나니 即 生의 意니 此를 推하야 仁을 見할만 하다』하엿도다. 此와 如히 心을 仁이라 하고 仁을 具體的으로 說한 結果는 自己의 尊大를 感知케 하엿다. 自己의 尊待를 弊한 者는 人欲이니 此를 去하는 工夫를 乃儒佛에 分하야 佛은 見性이라 云하야 性의 何者됨을 知함에 止하니라. 然하면 儒家의 人欲을 掃함은 如何한가. 曰 窮理에 在할 뿐이다. 理는 萬殊하나 畢竟 統一總腦한 바 有하니 故로 其大한 者를 究하면 自然히 貫通할 바 有할지라. 豈 一一이  此를 究하랴. 此-謝子가 明道에 距하야 佛門悟入에 近한 處니라. 然하나 佛家와 如히 全혀 下學의 工夫를 廢함이 아니오 그 所謂 窮理란 者는 眞知를 要할 뿐이라. 要컨대 上蔡는 具體的으로 仁을 解釋하야 心이라 하고 天이라 함으로써 心이 그 學의 中心이 되엇나니 그의 『佛之論性 如儒之論心』이라 言한 者로 보아도 如何히 彼가 心을 重大視 하엿슴을 可知할지로다. 如斯히 心을 重히 한 結果는 彼로 하여금 知行合一說에 到達케 하고 딸아 解脫을 尙하야 畢竟 聖門의 範圍 外에 超脫케 하엿다. 然則 此 學問의 思潮는 怡然히 陸學의 先驅로다.

乙. 楊龜山
龜山의 名은 時요 字는 中立이니 南劒將樂의 人이라. 其性이 極히 聰悟하고 溫容婉柔하야 伊川이 最愛하다. 紹興 5年에 卒하니 年 23이라. 謚曰 文靖이라 하다. 其著한 바는 三經義辨, 語錄, 龜山集 等이 有하니 龜山이 洛學의 始祖라 稱함은 歷史的 關係에 羅從源을 經하야 李延平에 至하야 디듸어 未子에 至하엿슴으로써-라.
(1) 敬과 義의 同一  敬으로써 內를 直할 時는 發하야 外에 表한 者-自然義니 敬義는 別物이 아니라 『敬必有義 有義必有敬』이니 但 內外의 別과 本末의 分이 有할 뿐이다.
(2) 龜山은 以爲하되 『聖人이 誠意正心으로부터 治國平天下에 至하기까지 其理-一이니 內外에 立키 不可하고 또 그 誠意正心을 見하면 天下-此에 由하야 平함을 見하겟다』하엿도다.
(3) 性善  楊子는 佛敎와 性善惡을 比하야 曰 佛敎에 性眞空이라 云한 者는 人을 離함이요 人을 離함은 所謂＜44＞ 頑空通이라. 第八庵摩羅識虛에 白淨無垢라 云하고 第九阿賴耶識은 善惡의 種子를 云하엿스니 白淨無垢는 即 孟子의 性善이 是로다. 然한데 楊龜山의 門人에 注意할만한 者는 唯 胡五峯, 羅豫章의 2人이로다.

一.  胡五峯
(傳幷書)
胡五峯의 名은 宏이오 字는 仁仲이니 學者-五峯先生이라 하니라. 그의 著書로는 知言, 詩文, 皇王大紀가 有하니라.

(가) 性과 心  胡子 曰 『聖人이 道의 軆를 指하야 性이라 云하고 其用을 指하야 心이라 云하니 性은 動치 안키 不能하야 動하면 即 心이 된다』하엿스니 胡子는 心으로써 活動的이라 하야 此를 性으로부터 分하고 오즉 性으로써 靜한 者라 하다.
(나) 性은 絶對의 善이니라.  明道의 說에 性은 所謂 元氣라 하엿다. 此에서 龜山은 性善으로써 庵摩羅에 比하고 善惡으로써 阿賴耶識에 比하니 即 性의 絶對의 善된 思想은 其中에 包含되엇다. 五峯이 亦 其說을 受하니 曰 『性天地鬼神之奧』라. 善으로써도 此를 言키 不足하거던 况惡이랴 하고 更히 그 先君子의 言을 聽하여 曰 『孟子-性善을 道함은 歎美의 辭-오 決코 惡과 對함이 아니라』하니 그 絶對善됨으로써니라. 性으로써 絶對善이라 한 바 意는 何者인가? 乃物로써 그 定分에 滿足케 함으로써-라. 其言에 曰 『至哉吾觀天地之神道,  其時無愆, 賦形萬物, 無大無細, 各足其分, 大和保合, 變化無窮也, 凡人之生, 粹然天地之心, 道義究具, 無適無莫, 不可以善惡辨, 不可以是非分, 無過也, 無不及也, 此中所以名也』라 하엿스니 此 一節로써 能히 그의 絶對性善의 說을 可히 見할 수가 足하도다.
(다) 心은 不死니라.  性의 發動을 司配하는 心이니 故로 節에 中치 안는다 함은 心에 在하니라. 然하면 心은 何에 標準하야 求하여야 可할고. 曰 此를 良心에 本할 뿐이다. 是-人類에 極히 機敏한 機關으로써 能히 是非邪正을 鑑別하는 者라. 故로 曰 『人皆有良心, 被之以桀紂之名, 雖匹夫라도 不受也』라 하니라. 然하면 胡子哲學의 中心은 即 心이니 胡子-此心을 尙함으로부터 曰 『心無死生』이라 하고 又以爲 『無以形觀心而以心觀心則知之矣』라 하니 更言하면 心은 生死가 無하고 形은 死生이 有하다 함에 不外하도다.
(나) 決論  此를 要컨대 心은 活動的 物로써 그 行爲에 發한 바-或善或惡하나니 良心에 從하면 善하고 放하면 惡하다 한다. 胡子의 哲學은 常識에 近한 嫌이 有하나 頗히＜45＞分析 明快한 點이 有하니라.

二. 李延平
李延平의 名은 伺요 字는 愿이니 南釰人이라. 年 24에 羅仲素-河洛의 學을 傳한다 함을 聞하고 遂往學하니 仲素의 爲人이 本來世에 名을 求치 아니한 者라. 先生이 獨히 此를 深契하고 退屛하야 世事를 謝絶한 事-40餘年에 簞瓢-屢空하되 怡然自適하야 操存이 頻固하고 涵養이 益熱하야 發而皆中節하니라. 隆興元年 10月에 卒하니 年이 71이라. 其著한 바 書는 延平問答及朱子語錄 等에 付하야 그 思想을 見할만 하니라.

가, 根本思想  延平學問의 第一義는 靜坐瞑目하고 天理를 體認하야 喜怒哀樂이 아즉 發치 안는 內에서 其中을 求함에 在하다. 其中을 求得한 然後에 此를 發用함을 涵養의 法에 第一이라 하니 曰 『問之道, 不在多言,  但黙坐澄心, 體認天理, 若是, 雖一毫私欲之發, 亦退聽矣, 久用力於此, 庶幾漸明, 講學始有力』이라 하니라. 朱子 亦曰 『延平先生이 人의 靜坐를 敎하엿다』하나니 此로써 그 學問의 方法이 禪에 近함을 能히 見하겟도다.
나, 朱子에 對한 影響  朱子-24歲의 時에 延平을 見하고 滔滔히 自家의 所學을 吐露한대 先生이 謂曰 『子-許多히 說하나 面前의 事를 不解한다』함에 對하야 朱子-忽然 反省하야 卽 自家의 所學이 不足타 함을 自覺하엿다 한다...(李延平 完)＜46＞
