To the Colleagues of the Gaebyeok Company!!!
                        Mokch'un Hagin

As the proverb goes, "One bows during the Silla period when eating water parsley bundles," my congratulations are late, for which I am ashamed and fearful. Nevertheless, whenever I see that our peninsula's magazine world's firstborn child, "Gaebyeok," not only had a smooth birth but also improves in both content and form with each advancing issue, achieving so-called healthy development, I rejoice wholeheartedly for the appearance of a powerful new journal in our desolate press circles. At the same time, I do not hesitate to express my fullest respect to you gentlemen, who are its mother and wet nurse.

In a word, the position of your esteemed magazine within our peninsula's magazine world can be likened to the sole heir of the third generation in a house with nothing but four bare walls. It bears the responsibility and expectation of reviving and renewing the declining family reputation and neglected gates—that is, it cannot but benefit the people's hearts with sound discourse and contribute to the ways of the world with lofty assertions, nor can it avoid appointing itself as a friend to the modern youth who hunger and thirst for knowledge and yearn for civilization. How weighty, then, are the honor and duty of the newborn "Gaebyeok"!

Therefore, for the fulfillment and longevity of this child bearing such heavy responsibility, we cannot but realize our duty to supply, before anything else, food and clothing suitable for its nourishment and hygiene. Consequently, it is a self-evident truth that paying one's dues only after receiving a reminder notice can hardly be recognized as the act of a good taxpayer.

In fulfilling this duty, one should not refuse to offer even one's blood-stained loincloth (血褌), nor avoid submitting even worn-out trousers (弊袴). This much, even this foolish humble self has understood since the day I first enjoyed human rights under civil law. However, unfortunately, being a humble student who clearly has not even mastered the first volume of a brief history, it is recognized by both myself and others that I am a first-rate figure among the extremely poor. Thus, I was confident that I would, of course, bathe in the grace of tax exemption right from the start when the assessment amount was determined. Yet, upon the issuance of a demand notice from you gentlemen, who yield nothing in harshness to the tax officials known for their extreme severity (拔鼎牽犢), I indeed let out a cry of lament.

No matter how heavy the duty, the impossible is ultimately impossible; how is it different from a mosquito trying to carry Mount T'aesan? If an elementary school student is told to submit a doctoral dissertation, the fault must be attributed not to the incapable student but to the unreasonable demand of the person who ordered it.

For the reasons stated above, I earnestly request that the levy notice so kindly issued be temporarily granted a stay of execution. If there is spare space in your esteemed paper, I eagerly hope you will allow me to fulfill my obligation by publishing a recently composed poor poem. Finally, I respectfully pray that the silent blessings of our ancestors and the protection of the spirits may always be with your esteemed magazine. "From a guest house outside Sakuradamon, on the 3rd night of a decade in September, Gyeongsin Year (1920)"<133>

**Summary**

The author, Mokch'un Hagin, writes to the staff of the newly launched magazine "Gaebyeok," congratulating them belatedly but warmly on its successful publication and ongoing development. He likens the magazine to a crucial sole heir destined to revive the desolate Korean publishing world, emphasizing its heavy responsibility to educate youth and guide society. Humorously portraying himself as extremely poor, he pleads inability to meet a likely financial or written contribution request, comparing it to asking a mosquito to carry a mountain, and asks instead to submit a humble poem to fulfill his obligation, concluding with blessings for the magazine's future. From a historical perspective, the article reveals the high hopes placed on new cultural ventures like "Gaebyeok" in the early colonial period as vital forces for national consciousness and enlightenment. The author's self-deprecating humor about poverty and his mention of being outside Sakuradamon (Tokyo) offer glimpses into the economic struggles and transnational connections of Korean intellectuals at the time.

開闢社同人諸兄!!!
                        木春學人
俗談에 「미나리강회 먹을 때에 세배한다.」는 세음으로 致賀가 느져서 慚悚합니다마는 何如間 우리 半島 雜誌界 初生兒 「開闢」이 順産되엇슬 뿐아니라 號數가 進함을 隨하야 內容과 體裁가 共히 整頓되어 所謂 健全한 發達을 遂함을 見할 때마다 寂寞하던 我言論界를 爲하야 有力한 新誌의 出現을 衷心으로부터 欣喜하며 同時에 産母가 되시고 媬婦가 되시는 諸君子에게 滿腔의 敬意를 表하기에 躊躇치 안나이다.
一言으로써 蔽하면 우리 半島 雜誌界에 在한 貴誌의 位置는 譬컨대 四壁徒立한 家中의 三代 獨子이라 하겟도다. 零替하던 家聲과 荒廢된 門庭을 振興하며 重新케 할 責任이 有하며 期待를 負하얏스니 即 健全한 言論으로 人心을 裨益하며 高尙한 主張으로써 世道에 寄與함이 無치 못할지며 知識에 飢渴하고 文明에 憧憬하는 現代 靑年의 友朋으로 自任치 아니치 못할지니 新生兒 「開闢」의 榮譽와 任務가 엇지 또한 重치 아니하리오.
그러면 我等은 此 任重責大한 新兒의 充實과 益壽를 爲하야는 何物보다도 먼저 滋養과 衛生에 適合한 食物과 衣服을 供給치 아니치 못할 義務가 有함을 自覺치 아니치 못할 지며 從하야 催告書를 待한 後에 賦課金을 納付하는 것은 決코 善良한 納稅義務者로 認키 難한 것은 自明의 理이라 할지로다.
此 義務를 盡함에 當하야는 血褌이라도 提供을 辭치 못할 지며 弊袴라도 納付를 避치 못할 것은 庸愚한 小生으로도 民法에서 人權 享受하던 其日부터 覺悟한 바이나 그러나 不幸히 史略初卷 一冊을 分明히 學得치 못한 小生은 極貧者中으로도 第一流 人物인 것은 自他가 俱認하는 바인 즉 賦課金調定에는 勿論 免稅의 恩典을 劈頭에 浴할 줄로 自信하얏더니 苛酷하기로는 拔鼎牽犢하는 稅務主事 나으리들에게 讓치 아니하시는 諸君子의 督促狀 發付에는 果然 怨嗟의 聲을 發하얏나이다.
아모리 義務가 重하다 할지라도 不可能한 것은 結局 不可能한 것인 즉 蚊이 泰山을 負치 못하는 것과 何가 異하리오. 小學生徒 더러 博士 論文을 提出하라 하면 能치 못하는 生徒보다도 命하는 人의 無理한 것으로 咎를 歸치 아니치 못할지로다.
敍上의 理由로써 모처럼 下命하신 賦課告知書는 暫時 執行猶豫에 附하시기를 懇願하오며 貴紙에 餘白이 有하시거든 近構惡詩를 揭載하사 塞責케 하시기를 顒望하오며 終에 臨하야 祖先의 黙佑와 神靈의 呵護가 恒常 貴誌에 잇기를 恭祝하나이다. 「庚申 9月 旬 3夜 櫻田門外 客舍에서」＜133＞
