A Study of Innaech'ŏn
						Yarae
Originally, what the Great Divine Teacher (大神師, Suun Ch'oe Cheu) called Ch'ŏndogyo (天道, Heavenly Way) must have been confidently asserted as the ultimate goal of ideals and the final perfection of truth. If we now wish to study the ultimate ideal of Ch'ŏndogyo, we must first dissect the source of the Great Divine Teacher's spirit. To dissect the source of the Great Divine Teacher's spirit, we inevitably must use as material the fragments scattered in various religious texts, besides the *Tonggyŏng Taejŏn* (東經大全) and *Yongdam Yusa* (龍潭遺詞) personally authored by the Great Divine Teacher. Furthermore, in presenting this, I intend to broadly state the general outline of his thought. However, one regrettable matter as we attempt to discuss this is that the Great Divine Teacher met the tragic incident in Taegu (大邱) merely five years after his enlightenment. Moreover, even during this brief five-year period, he was labeled as practicing a deviant path, spending most of his time amidst persecution (風呻雨泣, literally 'groaning in wind and weeping in rain'), thus burying his intellectual activities. Therefore, in the era of the Great Divine Teacher, there was neither a formalized faith nor unified doctrines. Simply put, the Great Divine Teacher merely laid the foundation of Ch'ŏndogyo; there was no elegant and magnificent building. What can be outlined as the foundational thought of the Great Divine Teacher is as follows:

A. Basic Religious Concepts
a. Concept of Heaven (天): Innaech'ŏn-ism (人乃天主義, Man is Heaven-ism) based on a pantheistic view (汎神觀).
b. Concept of the Way (道): Confucian-Buddhist-Taoist syncretism (儒佛仙合一主義) that synthesizes and harmonizes all truths by converging them into Innaech'ŏn-ism.
c. Concept of Teaching (敎): Spirit-flesh unity-ism (靈肉一致主義) based on the Innaech'ŏn concept.
d. Ultimate Goal of Religion: Heaven-human unity-ism (天人合一主義) based on the Innaech'ŏn concept. <46>
These four great spirits can be called the basic religious concepts of the Great Divine Teacher. However, to reach the culmination of "d," Heaven-human unity, based on the three great concepts "a," "b," and "c," there must necessarily be a definite path or method. Therefore, the Great Divine Teacher proceeded to establish methods of spiritual training.

B. Religious Training Methods
a. Self-reliant spiritual inspiration (靈感) of Innaech'ŏn: The Twenty-One Character Sacred Chant (三七聖呪).
b. Self-reliant method of observing nature and awakening the mind (觀性覺心) of Innaech'ŏn: Prayer for seven days, twenty-one days, forty-nine days, or one hundred and five days.
c. Self-reliant precepts (誡律) of Innaech'ŏn: The Four Great Commandments (四大誡命).
These three great methods constitute the Great Divine Teacher's basic concepts of training, characterized by relying not on external power (他力) but trusting in self-power (自力) to manifest the true spirit of one's own Heaven (自天). Therefore, the result is, of course, that the mind (心) occupies the subjective position of its omnipotence. The mind is the opportunity (契機) for humans to originally unite with Heaven, the true essence (眞諦) of merging and uniting with the Great Way of Heaven and Earth, and the protagonist that manifests the culture of the teaching in the human world (人界). Therefore, it goes without saying that there is no Heaven and no Teaching apart from the mind. Thus, observing the single phrase from the scriptures declared by the Great Divine Teacher, "Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom were taught by the ancient sages; guarding the mind and rectifying the self is what I have newly established (仁義禮智先聖之所敎守心正己唯我之更定)," does it not clearly state how the Great Divine Teacher affirmed the reason why the mind is the subject of all capabilities? Consequently, the Great Divine Teacher endeavored to explain in detail to the general disciples, through various talismans (符圖), how the mind is the symbol (表象) of omnipotence. To outline these:
Spirit Talisman (靈符) (Symbol of the Mind): Kungŭl (弓乙), the Mind is the symbol of Kung (弓, Heaven) and Ŭl (乙, Human), i.e., the symbol of Heaven-human unity (Symbol of Innaech'ŏn).
T'aegŭk (太極), the Mind is the symbol representing the completeness of all principles (Symbol of Innaech'ŏn).
Originally, the mind is formless (無形). Because it is formless, ordinary people bury its great capability, that is, the power (威力) of Heaven, amidst uncertainty (有耶無耶). Therefore, the Great Divine Teacher, to explain the greatness of this mind to the public, merely represented it with these Spirit Talismans.
The above can generally be called the Great Divine Teacher's basic conception of religion. Following these points, I will briefly discuss this further.

Fundamental Principle of Innaech'ŏn <47>

From our perspective, Innaech'ŏn can be called theism based on a pantheistic view. Therefore, it means that humans are tangible Heaven, the most exact crystallization of the great Heaven. Some may misunderstand "Human" or "Innaech'ŏn" as atheism that destroys the concept of God, the spiritual Great Ruler of the universe, but this is definitely not the case. The Great Divine Teacher rather advocated theism, arguing that all things in the universe were generated under the spirit of God. Thus, at the very beginning of the *Tonggyŏng Taejŏn*, does it not clearly indicate the existence of a Heavenly Lord (天主) who governs and rules this universe by stating, "Verily, since ancient times, the alternation of spring and autumn, the flourishing and decline of the four seasons, unchanging and unaltering, this too is the trace of the Heavenly Lord's creation, manifest clearly under heaven (盖自上古以來春秋迭代四時盛衰不遷不易是亦天主造化之迹昭然于天下也)"? However, the Great Divine Teacher's concept of the Heavenly Lord does not refer to an individual, personal God (上帝), but implies a pantheistic, i.e., spiritual meaning. Spiritual God means conceptualizing the spiritual truth, goodness, and beauty (眞善美) that govern all universal phenomena. Therefore, it is the conception that there is no place where this spirit of God does not reside, from the great stars and constellations above down to the minute dust and mustard seeds below. In other words, an insect possesses the spirit equivalent to an insect, a bird possesses the spirit equivalent to a bird, and a human possesses the spirit equivalent to a human. By the same logic, the Earth possesses a spirit equivalent to the Earth, the Solar System possesses a spirit equivalent to the Solar System, and ultimately, the Great Universe possesses a spirit equivalent to the Great Universe. We call this Great Spirit of the Great Universe the Heavenly Lord. Thus, this Spirit of the Great Universe and the spirit of humans are fundamentally a single reality. Therefore, just as we see God in the Great Universe, we can also see the same God in the individual self, i.e., the human.
However, the universe must have reached today's phenomenon through the evolution and development of this Great Spirit. That is:
The universe is everything; everything is God; humans are one animal among all things; animals are the most evolved among all things; consequently, humans are the most evolved among animals, i.e., the most evolved form of God, the crown of all creation (萬物之靈長), and herein lies the qualification to be the master of Heaven and Earth.
In the *Tonggyŏng* (東經, likely referring to *Tonggyŏng Taejŏn*), which recounts a direct dialogue between the Great Divine Teacher and Heaven on April 5th, Kyŏngsin year (庚申, 1860), this concept is expressed: "Unexpectedly in April, my heart grew cold and my body trembled, afflicted with an illness that could not be diagnosed, unable to speak of the indescribable condition, when some immortal words suddenly entered my ears. Startled, I arose and inquired, and a voice said, 'Do not fear, do not be afraid. The people of the world call me Sangje (上帝, Supreme Ruler). Do you not know Sangje?' I asked the reason, and it replied, 'I also had no merit, so I gave birth to you in the world. Teach people this law. Do not doubt, do not doubt.'" Looking at this passage, it certainly seems as if a personal Sangje commanded the Great Divine Teacher from the sky. However, based on the passage in the *Nonhangmun* (論學文, Essay on Learning) which states, "I too was fearful, only lamenting being born late, my body often trembling and cold. Externally, there was the energy of spiritual contact; internally, there was the teaching of descending words. Looking, it cannot be seen; listening, it cannot be heard. My mind was always puzzled. Guarding my mind and rectifying my spirit, I asked, 'Why is it so?' It replied, 'My mind is precisely your mind (吾心卽汝心也). How can people know this? They know Heaven and Earth but do not know the spirits (鬼神). The spirits are I. As for you, the way is boundless and unending. Cultivate and refine it, compose its writings to teach people, establish its laws to spread virtue, then I shall let you live long and be renowned under heaven.'" <48> From this point, it is clear that the Great Divine Teacher's concept of Heaven refers to the spiritual mind (心靈) which is the spirit of the Great Heaven, that is, his own mind-heaven (心天). Now, integrating these two passages, the *Podŏngmun* (布德文, Proclamation of Virtue) mentions some immortal words suddenly entering the ears, implying words coming from outside to inside. In the *Nonhangmun*, it speaks of the teaching of descending words from within, implying words coming from inside to outside. Why is there such a great contradiction in writings merely a few lines apart? Just as great enlightenment must follow great doubt, a great truth indeed lies hidden within this contradiction. That is, the Great Divine Teacher perceived the Cosmic Great Spirit, the Great Ruler of the universe, i.e., the Great Heaven (大天), and the individual spirit ruling the individual, i.e., one's own Heaven (自天), as the same spiritual entity (靈軆). Consequently, he believed the response (感應) of his own Heaven, i.e., the spiritual mind, to be the divine instruction (神訓) of the Great Heaven, i.e., Sangje. Therefore, the immortal words mentioned in the *Podŏngmun* are presented as a skillful means (方便), like a revelation from the Great Heaven, while the teaching of descending words mentioned in the *Nonhangmun* concludes as the response of one's own Heaven. This is precisely the point of convergence (契點) where Sangje, being the Great Heaven, and the human, being the Small Heaven (小天), become one. Furthermore, exploring within the *Yongdam Yusa* (遺詞), this principle is expressed even more appropriately. A line in the *Ansimga* (安心歌, Song of Peace of Mind) says, "The voice crying out in the void shakes Heaven and Earth," which refers to Sangje commanding the Great Divine Teacher, making it seem completely as if a corporeal Sangje gave face-to-face orders (面命) to the Great Divine Teacher. However, in a passage from the *Todŏkka* (道德歌, Song of Morality), it is written, "Ignorant people of the world, even if they know Heaven and Earth, lack a heart of reverence (敬畏之心), so what do they truly know? They speak as if seeing Sangje residing on the Jade Capital Terrace (玉京臺) in Heaven. Setting aside the principles of Yin and Yang (陰陽理致), isn't this just empty talk (虛無之說)? (Omitted section) Heaven and Earth are also spirits (鬼神); spirits are also Yin and Yang. Not knowing this, what use is examining the scriptures (經傳)?" Here, there is a sense that the previously mentioned personal Sangje is utterly destroyed without a trace (一點의 痕迹도 업시). If one were to judge the Great Divine Teacher's thought solely based on these two passages, he would seem entirely like an atheist. However, in the following passage, it says, "How could one not know the Heavenly Principle (天理)? The movements of a person's hands and feet, this is also spirit (鬼神); the workings of the mind between good and evil, this is also vital energy (氣運); speaking and laughing, this is also creation (造化)." And also a passage in the *Ansimga* says, "O you aimless ones, do not believe in me at all, believe only in Hanullim (하눌님, God/Heavenly Lord). Since He is enshrined in your body, why seek afar leaving what is near (捨近取遠)?". From these verses, the Great Divine Teacher's Innaech'ŏn-ism emerges as clear as blue sky and white sun (靑天白日). Thus, the Great Divine Teacher simply expressed Innaech'ŏn-ism in the thirteen-character chant (呪文), "Serving the Heavenly Lord, creation is determined; eternally unforgotten, all things are known (侍天主造化定永世不忘萬事知)." In the *Taejŏn* (大全, *Tonggyŏng Taejŏn*), Chapter on Chant Interpretation, it states, "'Serving' (侍) means internally there is divine spirit (神靈), externally there is transformation by vital energy (氣化), which everyone in the world knows and does not change." And in the *Much'e Pŏpgyŏng* (無體法經, Scripture Without Form), it states, "'Serving' (侍) means 'awakened' (覺者); 'Heavenly Lord' (天主) means 'one's own Heaven' (自天之意)." From these points, the chant can certainly be called a sacred text (法文) symbolizing Innaech'ŏn. <49> In this way, the Great Divine Teacher established the great doctrine (大宗) of Innaech'ŏn and through it sought to resolve the problems of the universe, human life, morality, and society, declaring, "My Way (吾道) is the Way of Infinite Ultimate (無極大道) for the Later Fifty Thousand Years (後天五萬年)." Now, let us discuss the Great Divine Teacher's Innaech'ŏn-ism divided into three parts: Religion, Philosophy, and Science.

A. Innaech'ŏn-ism Viewed Religiously
What is the definition of religion? It is the chain linking the relative and the absolute, the relationship between God and humans. I have no objection (疑義) to this definition.
What is the purpose of religion? To provide comfort (慰安) to the individual and seek peace (平和) for society. I have no objection to this definition either.
However, within my heart (胸中), I harbor a great question (疑案) and a great criticism (非難). What is it? It is that the conception of the ideal, which is the world or purpose of religion, differs among them.
Let's try counting the religions of East and West, ancient and modern. The number of denominations (敎宗) and sects (敎派) has been numerous. However, these numerous religions each possessed distinct concepts and distinct methods. That is, whether viewing religion B from religion A, or further viewing religion C from religion B, or viewing religions D and E from religion C. Among these, ideals that are completely incompatible like fire and water (永炭不相容) are included, giving the feeling of entirely separate worlds (別天地). Consequently, each religion insisted on its own separate world, viewing B from A as a demonic teaching (魔敎), and C from B being called heresy (異端), each asserting its own conceived religious world as the supreme truth of the universe, leading to mutual attacks.
Here, standing in the center of all religions, without bias (不偏不倚) towards any, under a fair and sacred consciousness, can we lightly judge which is truly true and which is truly false? Hypothetically, under the notion that we have judged this fairly, if we deem A to be true, then B and C must inevitably be false. If we deem B to be true, then A and C must also inevitably be false. Consider this: How could respectable religions with thousands of years of history and hundreds of millions of followers bear so many facts based on falsehood (虛僞)? How could they provide comfort to these hundreds of millions, billions (億兆) through deceit (假妄)? If, based on the fact of having such history and such followers, one calls it falsehood, then I would rather have to regard falsehood itself as truth. This is my great question. Now, attempting to somewhat clarify these doubts and difficulties based on the Great Divine Teacher's Innaech'ŏn-ism, Ch'ŏndogyo (天道), it is said: All truth, all things, all activities in the universe are nothing but the manifestation (發揮) of the Heavenly Way (天道). Therefore, the Heavenly Way is neither old nor new, yet both old and new; neither spirit nor flesh, yet both spirit and flesh; neither spirit nor matter, yet both spirit and matter; neither real nor unreal, yet both real and unreal; neither small nor great, yet both small and great. It regards the absolute entity (絶對體) of the universe as its scope (範圍) and the absolute truth (絶對眞) of the universe as its content (內容). It considers everything from the great stars and constellations above down to the minute dust and mustard seeds below as manifestations of the essence (精彩) of the Heavenly Way. Conversely, returning to the human world, the doctrines (敎理) of all religions are parts of the Heavenly Way, the theories (理論) of all philosophies are ideals of the Heavenly Way, and the facts (事實) of all sciences are processes (過程) of the Heavenly Way. Thus, while thinking of everything as a manifestation of the Heavenly Way, it simultaneously accepts (容認) everything as an expression (表顯) of truth. Then, the religion of Innaech'ŏn-ism is, philosophically, a pantheistic religion (汎神觀的 宗敎)... (Unfinished) <50>

**Summary**

This article by "Yarae" delves into the core tenets of Ch'ŏndogyo, focusing on the "Innaech'ŏn" (Man is Heaven) doctrine established by its founder, Suun Ch'oe Cheu (referred to as "Great Divine Teacher"). It outlines Suun's basic religious concepts (pantheistic Heaven, syncretic Way, spirit-flesh unity, Heaven-human unity) and training methods (chanting, prayer, commandments), emphasizing self-reliance and the centrality of the mind (心) as the connection to Heaven. The author argues that Innaech'ŏn, despite seeming atheistic, is a form of theism rooted in pantheism, where the universal spirit (Heavenly Lord/Sangje) and the individual human spirit are one, reconciling apparent contradictions in Suun's writings about receiving divine messages. Finally, the article begins to position Innaech'ŏn as a comprehensive framework encompassing all truths (religious, philosophical, scientific), capable of resolving inter-religious conflict by viewing all faiths as partial expressions of the ultimate Heavenly Way.

For historians, this 1920 article is significant as it reflects early 20th-century efforts by Ch'ŏndogyo intellectuals to systematically articulate and defend their founder's theology, particularly the potentially controversial Innaech'ŏn concept, shortly after the 1919 March First Movement in which Ch'ŏndogyo played a major role. The text showcases the attempt to reconcile seemingly contradictory accounts of Suun's revelations and to present Ch'ŏndogyo not just as a religion but as a universal philosophy synthesizing various traditions and even science, positioning it as a uniquely Korean response to modernity and foreign influences during the colonial period. The emphasis on self-reliance (自力) and the internal nature of divinity (自天) could also be interpreted in the context of fostering national consciousness and resilience under Japanese rule.

人乃天의 硏究
						夜雷
元來 大神師의 이른바 天道는 理想의 究極目的으로 眞理의 最後圓滿이라 自信한 것이겟다. 吾人이 이제 天道의 究極理想을 硏究코저 하면 먼저 大神師의 精神源泉을 解剖할 必要가 잇고 大神師의 精神源泉을 解剖코저 하면 不得已 大神師의 親述한 東經大全 龍潭遺詞 外에 各敎書에 散在한 片言隻字를 材料로 할지며 亦 그를 發表함에는 槪括的으로 그 思想大體를 擧하야 槪言코저 하노라. 然이나 吾人이 此를 論코저 함에 當하야 遺憾인 一事는 大神師는 覺道後-僅히 五年에 大邱의 慘變을 當하엿스며 又此-僅한 五年의 光陰에도 異道의 指目을 受하야 太半風呻雨泣의 中에 그 思想的 活動을 埋送하엿는 故로 大神師의 時代에는 아즉 方式잇는 信仰, 統一잇는 敎說이 無한 一事가 是라 간단히 言하면 大神師는 天道의 基礎를 定하엿슬 뿐이오 優美華麗한 建物이 無하엿도다 今에 大神師의 基礎的 思想이라할만한 者를 槪括하면
甲, 宗敎的 基本 觀念
가, 天의 觀念 汎神觀上에 立脚한 人乃天主義
나, 道의 觀念 萬眞理를 人乃天主義에 歸納하야 總合調和한 儒佛仙合一主義
다, 敎의 觀念 人乃天觀念에 立脚한 靈肉一致主義
라,  宗敎의 最後目的 人乃天觀念에 立脚한 天人合一主義＜46＞
此 四大精神은 大神師의 宗敎的 基本觀念이라 할지라. 然한데 「가」「나」「다」의 三大觀念에 基礎하야 卽 「라」天人合一의 極致에 到達코저 하면 一定한 通路인 方式이 無치 안이함이 不可하니 故로 大神師는 進하야 修煉의 方式을 定하엿더라.
乙, 宗敎的 修煉方式
가, 人乃天의 自力的 靈感 三七聖呪
나, 人乃天의 自力的 觀性覺心의 方法 七日 三七日 四九日 혹은 百五日의 祈禱
다, 人乃天의 自力的 誡律 四大誡命
此 三大方式은 大神師의 基本的 修煉觀念인데 무엇에던지 他力에 依치 안이하고 自力에 信賴하야 自天의 眞精神을 發揮함에 在하니 故로 그 結果는 心이 그 萬能力의 主體的 位置에 在하엿슬 것은 勿論일지라. 心은 人이 本來 天에 合一하는 契機이며 天地大道에 融化一致하는 眞諦로 敎의 文化를 人界에 發揮하는 主人公이라. 故로 心을 離하야 天이 無하고 敎가 無함은 勿論일진저. 故로 「仁義禮智先聖之所敎守心正己唯我之更定」이라 한 大神師의 宣言한 經傳 中 一句節로 觀할지라도 大神師가 如何히 心으로 萬能力의 主體되는 所以를 明言하심이 안일것이냐. 그리하야 大神師는 心이 萬能力의 表象되는 所以를 各種의 符圖로써 有形的으로 一般門弟에게 詳示코저 努心하엿나니 此를 槪擧하면
靈符(心의 表象) 弓乙, 心은 弓天乙人卽天人合一된 表象(人乃天의 象徵)
太極, 心은 萬理를 具備하엿다는 表象(人乃天의 象徵)
原來 心은 無形이라. 無形인 故로 普通人은 그 偉大한 能力 即 天의 威力을 有耶無耶의 中에 埋送하는 故로 於是에 大神師-此心의 偉大를 一般에게 說示키 爲하야 此等의 靈符로써 表象함에 不過한 者일진저.
以上은 大槪-大神師의 宗敎에 對한 基本觀念이라 할지라 余에 條를 追하야 此를 簡略히 論하면

人乃天의 根本 原理＜47＞

吾人의 思考로 觀하면 人乃天은 即 汎神觀上에 立脚한 有神主義라 할지라. 故로 人은 卽 大한 天의 最酷肖한 結晶인 有形的 天이라 云하는 意味일진저. 人-或은 人乃天이라하면 宇宙의 精神的 大主宰인 神의 觀念을 破壞한 無神論者라 誤解하는 者-有할지나 此는 決코 不然하니 大神師는 寧히 有神論을 主唱하야 一切의 宇宙의 萬物이 神의 精神下에서 生成하엿다 論하엿나니 故로 東經大全 劈頭에 曰 「盖自上古以來春秋迭代四時盛衰不遷不易是亦天主造化之迹昭然于天下也」함으로써 明確히 此 宇宙의 上에는 此 宇宙를 支配하며 統轄하는 天主가 有함을 指함이 안인가. 然이나 大神師의 所謂 天主의 觀念은 個體的 곳 人格的 上帝를 謂함이 안이오 汎神的 即 精神的 意味함인데 精神的 神이라함은 一切 宇宙現象을 支配하는 靈的 眞善美를 槪念함이라. 故로 上으로 大天星辰 下으로 微塵纖芥에 至하기 까지 一切 此神의 精神이 歸宿치 안이하는 處가 無타하는 觀念이로다. 更言하면 蟲에는 蟲 뿐만한 精神이 有할 것이오 禽에는 禽 뿐만한 精神이 有할 것이오 人에는 人 뿐만한 精神이 有할지라. 그와 同理로 地球에는 地球 뿐만한 精神이 有할 것이오 太陽界에는 太陽界 뿐만한 精神이 有할 것이며 終에 大宇宙에는 大宇宙 뿐만한 精神이 有할지니 吾人은 此 大宇宙의 大精神을 稱하야 天主라 하도다. 그리하야 此 大宇宙의 精神과 人의 精神은 根本에서 唯一의 實在가 되나니 故로 吾人은 神을 大宇宙에서 見함과 共히 個體我卽人에서 또한 同一의 神을 見할만하도다.
然한데 宇宙는 此 大精神의 進化發達로써 今日의 現象에 至하엿슬리라. 卽
宇宙는 곳 一切物인데 一切物은 곳 神이며 人은 一切物中 一動物인데 動物은 一切物의 最進化한 者이며 結局 人은 動物中 最進化한 者로 卽 神의 最進化한 者로 萬物의 靈長이며 天地의 主人公될 만한 資格이 玆에 表顯하엿도다.
庚申 四月 五日-大神師-直接 天으로 問答하엿다 云하는 東經에 此觀念을 表明하야 曰「不意四月心寒身戰疾不得執症言不得難狀之際有何仙語忽入耳中驚起探問則曰勿懼勿恐世人謂我上帝汝不知上帝耶 問其所然한대 曰余亦無功故生汝 世間敎人此法勿疑勿疑」하라하신 一節로 보면 確實히 人格的 上帝가 空中으로부터 大神師를 命敎하신 듯 하도다. 그러나 論學文에 써잇는 「吾亦悚然只有恨生晩之際身多戰寒外有接靈之氣內有降話之敎視之不見聽之不聞心常怪訝守心正氣而問曰何爲若然曰吾心卽汝心也 人何知之知天地而無知鬼神鬼神者吾也及汝無窮無窮之道修而煉之制其文敎人正其法布德則令汝長生昭然于天下矣」＜48＞라한 一節에 因하야 是點에서 大神師의 天의 觀念은 大天의 精神되는 心靈 卽 自己의 心天을 指하야 言한 바 明白하도다. 今에 此兩節을 綜合하야 觀하면 布德文에는 엇던 仙語가 耳中에 忽入한다 云하셧스니 이는 語가 外로 內에 入한 者요 論學文에 至하야는 內로 降話의 敎가 잇다하엿스니 이는 話가 內로부터 外에 出한 者라 僅히 數行의 文에 不過한 問에 何故로 此等大矛盾이 有하엿슬가 大疑의 下에 반듯이 大覺이 有함과 如히 是矛盾의 中에는 實로 大眞理가 伏在하엿도다. 卽 大神師는 宇宙의 大主宰되는 宇宙的 大精神 卽 大天과 個體의 主宰되는 個體的 精神 卽 自天을 同한 靈軆로 看破한 結果 自天 卽 心靈의 感應을 大天 卽 上帝의 神訓으로 自信하엿슬지라. 故로 布德文에 云한 仙語라 함은 大天의 神啓와 如히 方便을 設하고 論學文에 云한 降話의 敎라 함은 卽 自天의 感應으로 歸結하엿나니 是乃大天 되는 上帝와 小天되는 人이 合一되는 契點일진저 又 遺詞中으로 探考하고보면, 此理가 더욱 適切히 表顯되엇나니 安心歌中-一節에 잇는 「空中에서 웨는 소리 天地가 振動한다」말한 句節은 곳 上帝가 大神師를 命하신바니 完全히 有軆의 上帝가 大神師를 面命하신 듯 하도다. 그러나 道德歌中 一節에 써잇는 「無知한 世上사람 아는 바 天地라도 敬畏之心업섯스니 아는 것이 무엇이며 天上에 上帝님이 玉京臺에 게시다고 보는 듯이 말을 하니 陰陽理致姑舍하고 虛無之說안일넌가 (中略-本文) 天地亦是鬼神이요 鬼神亦是 陰陽인줄 이가티 몰랏스니 經傳살펴 무엇하리」함에 至하야 前者의 이른바 人格的 上帝는 一點의 痕迹도 업시 破壞된 感이 잇도다. 다만 此二節 뿐으로 大神師의 思想을 專斷하고 보면 大神師는 全히 無神論上의 一人이될 뿐이로다. 그러나 그 下節에 이르러 「天理야 모를소냐 사람의 手足動靜, 이는 亦是 鬼神이오 善惡間 마음用事, 이는 亦是 氣運이오 말하고 웃는 것은 이는 亦是 造化니라」云함과 又 安心歌中-一節에 「하염업는 이것들아 나는 都是 밋지말고 한울님만 미덧서라 네몸에 모셧스니 捨近取遠하단말가」云한 句節에서 大神師의 人乃天主義는 靑天白日과 가티 들어낫도다. 그리하야 大神師는 人乃天主義를 呪文十三字「侍天主造化定永世不忘萬事知」에 簡單히 表顯하엿나니 大全呪文解釋章에 일럿스되「侍者內有神靈外有氣化一世之人各知不移者也」하시고 無體法經에 일럿스되「侍者卽覺者也天主卽自天之意」라 하신 點에서 呪文은 確實히 人乃天을 象徵한 法文이라 할 수 잇도다. 大神師는＜49＞ 이와가티 人乃天의 大宗을 세우시고 이로써 宇宙問題 人生問題 道德問題 社會問題를 解決하시사 曰 吾道는 後天五萬年無極大道라 하셧도다. 이제 大神師의 人乃天主義를 宗敎,哲學,科學 三部에 分하야 論하면

甲, 宗敎上으로 觀한 人乃天主義
宗敎의 定義는 何이냐 相對와 絶對의 連鎖이며 神과 人의 關係라 함은 余는 此 定義에 對하야 疑義가 無하노라.
宗敎의 目的은 何이냐 個人의 慰安을 與하며 社會의 平和를 圖한다함은 余는 此 定義에 對하야도 疑義가 無하도다.
然이나 余는 余의 胸中에 大한 疑案이 有하며 大한 非難이 有하니 何이뇨 宗敎의 世界되는 卽 目的되는 理想의 觀念이 各殊한 것이라.
試하야 東西古今의 宗敎를 算來하면 敎宗 及 敎派의 數는 多數이엇섯다. 然한 此 多數의 宗敎는 各各 特殊의 觀念과 特殊의 方式을 가지고 잇섯나니 卽 甲敎로 乙敎를 觀하던지 乙敎로 更히 丙敎를 觀하던지 丙敎로 又 丁戊를 觀할지라. 此等의 中에는 全然 永炭不相容의 理想이 包含하야 各各 別天地의 感이 有하도다. 於是에 各敎는 各各 自己의 別天地를 固執하고 甲이 乙을 觀하되 是-魔敎라하며 乙이 丙을 視하되 是-異端이라 稱하야 各其 自己의 觀念한바 宗敎의 天地로 宇宙至上의 眞理라하야 互相攻擊함에 至하엿섯다.
玆에 吾人은 各 宗敎의 中央에 立하야 何者에 던지 不偏不倚하고 公平神聖한 意識下에서 何者가 果然 眞이며 何者가 果然 僞라 輕輕히 判斷할 수 잇스랴. 假定上 若 此를 公平히 判斷하엿다 하는 觀念下에서 若 甲으로 眞이라하면 乙丙은 不可不 虛僞가 되지 안이치 못할 것이오 若 乙로 眞이라하면 甲丙도 亦是 虛僞가되지 안이치 못할지라. 試思하라. 幾千年의 歷史, 幾億萬의 信徒를 有한 堂堂한 宗敎가 엇지 虛僞로써 幾多의 事實을 負하엿스랴. 엇지 假妄으로써 此等 幾多의 億兆의 慰安을 與하엿스랴. 若 此等의 歷史 此等의 信徒를 有한 事實로써 虛僞라 云할진대 余는 寧히 虛僞 그 者를 眞理로 看做치 안이치 못하리니 是가 余의 大한 疑案이로다. 今에 此 疑點을 大神師의 人乃天主義인 天道에 依하야 多少 그 疑端難點을 解明하면 曰 宇宙의 一切眞理, 一切事物, 一切活動은 總히 天道의 發揮에 不外하니 故로 天道는 非舊非新, 亦舊亦新, 非靈非肉, 亦靈亦肉, 非神非物, 亦神亦物, 非實非虛, 亦實亦虛, 非小非大, 亦小亦大라 하야 宇宙의 絶對體를 그 範圍라 하고 宇宙의 絶對眞을 그 內容이라 看做하되 大하얀 大天星辰 小하얀 微塵纖芥에 至하기까지 皆天道精彩의 發揮라 하고 反하야 人間界에 歸하얀 萬宗敎의 敎理가 皆天道의 部分이며 萬哲學의 理論이 皆天道의 理想이라 하며 萬科學의 事實이 皆天道의 過程이라 하야 무엇이던지 皆天道의 發揮로 思함과 同時에 무엇이던지 皆眞理의 表顯으로 容認하엿도다. 그러면 人乃天主義의 宗敎는 卽 哲學上 汎神觀的 宗敎이며(未完)＜50＞
