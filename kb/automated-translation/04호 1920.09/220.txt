Autumn Sigh
                        Han Pyŏl

If autumn is always like this,
What good is autumn?
That autumn is a good season
Is probably a lie.

Others have blooming faces,
Why do I have furrowed brows?
That saying, "Autumn is spring again,"
Must have been said about me.

Others have fresh rice and greens,
I alone have salty chaff gruel.
Unable even to continue that,
Sometimes I must go begging.

Others have autumn attire,
I alone just have hemp clothes.
Even those are worn out,
With holes scattered sparsely.

Others have plastered walls and papered floors,
I alone worry about windows and doors.
On top of that, even bedding
Is beyond hope.

Should I try catching a yellow chicken?
Don't even speak of white liquor.
How could I get refined rice
To even hold an ancestral rite (告祀)?

If only the weather were fine,
It would be fortunate for me.
Heaven is impartial (公),
Can I hope for special favor (私)? <100>

The school rice tax (講米), one sŏm, for the young one,
There is no way to provide it.
As I place my hand on my forehead,
My precious daughter whines and pulls.

At the rich man's house across the way,
The autumn harvest (秋收) is piled high.
Peeking through the gate,
How long can the gate bolt hold?

The tax deadline is in a few days,
As a duty of the common folk (百姓).
I know I must do it, but
I'll just face the penalty for arrears (滯納罰).

Have I ever spent a useless penny?
What is leisure?
Working to death all year long,
Others call me lazy.

A beggar in a year of plenty,
On top of that, the world's indifference (炎凉).
If someone were to visit,
It would be terribly awkward.

The coming spring is the next thing,
But how will I get through the winter?
In summer, I sell my labor,
Sighs are my autumn harvest (秋收).

If autumn is always like this,
What good is autumn?
That autumn is a good season
Is probably a lie. <101>

**Summary**

This poem, "Autumn Sigh," portrays the deep despair of a poor farmer during the autumn harvest season, a time traditionally associated with abundance. The speaker contrasts their own dire poverty—lack of food, proper clothing, adequate housing, and inability to pay taxes or perform rituals—with the prosperity of others ("남들," "장자집"). Despite working tirelessly year-round, the farmer faces hunger, debt, and social judgment, finding the notion of autumn as a "good season" a bitter lie. The poem serves as a poignant critique of social inequality and the crushing hardships faced by the rural poor. For historians, this poem offers a valuable ground-level perspective on the economic struggles of Korean tenant farmers in the early colonial period (1920). It starkly contrasts with official narratives of development or prosperity, highlighting the extreme poverty and sense of hopelessness prevalent among the lower classes, potentially exacerbated by colonial economic policies and taxation (구실, 滯納罰).

가을한숨
                        한별
가을이 다 이럴진대
가을은 해 무엇하나
가을이 존철이란
아마도 거짓말이
남들은 피인 얼굴
나는 어찌 찡긴 눈살
갈도봄 그말이야
나를 두고 함일세라
남가트면 햇밥푸성귀
나 혼자 소금에 피죽
그남아 못이어서
잇다금 걸으도다
남들은 가을살이
나 혼자 그저 베옷
그남아 다 떨어지어
구녁이 겅성드뭇
남들은 塗褙 장판
나혼자 窓戶 걱정
게다가 입울까지
可望이 아니로다
黃鷄나 잡아보랴
白酒으란 말도 마라
精한 쌀 어찌 어더
告祀나 하얏스면
날씨나 고웟스면
나에게는 다행이련
하늘은 구의(公)하다
아람(私)을 바랄소냐 ＜100＞
어린 놈의 講米 한 섬
나일 길이 바이 업서
이마에 손 언즐제
고명딸은 당기투정
저건너 장자집에
秋收가 담불담불
門間에 고대고대
빗장이 견딜것가
구실은 몃칠이 限
百姓된 義務로서
하여야는 하련마는
滯納罰 當할밧게
헛돈푼을 써보앗스랴
놀이라는 무엇인고
一年내 죽도록힘
남들은 게르다지
豊年엣 빌엉뱅이
게다가 炎凉이라
或時나 차젓스면
죽술간 난흘랏다
오는 봄은 다음이지
겨울은 어찌하노
여름에는 품야 팔지
한숨이 내 秋收라
가을이 다 이럴진대
가을은 해 무엇하나
가을이 존철이란
아마도 거짓말이＜101＞
＜100-101＞
