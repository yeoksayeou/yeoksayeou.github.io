米人 신꾸레열氏의 斷食療法 (Fasting Therapy of Mr. Sinclair, an American)

Recently, in a British review, there was an essay titled "Perfect Health" by an American, Mr. Sinclair. Its main point was to explain his own experiments and observations, describing the means by which he obtained perfect health. As this article holds considerable value worthy of attention, I extract its outline and introduce it to the readers under a separate title.

Mr. Sinclair was originally born into a good family and was naturally healthy, but as a result of excessive mental strain from engaging in writing, he suffered from stomach illness, headaches, and colds. He consulted several doctors, applied medicinal treatments, and diligently recuperated at the seaside during the summer, but obtained no effect whatsoever. Furthermore, his wife was also not in good health, suffering greatly each week, and his young child had also contracted pneumonia and had been suffering for several years. Consequently, Mr. Sinclair researched various things, wondering if there wasn't a way to perfect health in the world, and tried various methods. At that time, Mr. Fletcher's hygiene method was popular. Speaking of his secret method, it was that one should thoroughly chew food, absorb as much nutrition as possible from every part of the food, and eat only as much as the body actually requires. Mr. Sinclair was, for a time, fascinated by this method. Why? Because doctors' therapies were merely post-onset measures, and when it came to preventing illness, it was already too late, whereas Mr. Fletcher's <105> secret method was thought to be the best means to prevent illness and maintain health. Through this, he was able to understand the source of illnesses. That is, he said that various disease origins lie in the stagnation of toxins produced from undigested matter due to overeating. Therefore, accurately adapting the amount of food to the body's needs was known as the secret to obtaining perfect health. However, Mr. Sinclair could not cure his illness through that secret method. From this, he again conducted various studies and applied hydrotherapy, but it only had temporary effects, and the stomach illness remained. He also tried various exercise techniques, but these too were only temporarily effective. However, around this time, he happened to meet a woman whose physical health was enviably strong. He was astonished to learn that this woman had been weak, groaning in her sickbed year-round until 10 years prior. The woman had suffered from various ailments such as sciatica, acute rheumatism, chronic stomach illness, neurasthenia, and melancholy, but now her complexion and blood color were exceptionally vibrant. This woman traveled 28 miles on horseback with Mr. Sinclair for 6 hours to ascend Mount Hamilton peak in California State. And when she mentioned that she had completely fasted for the previous 4 months, eating not a single piece of food, Mr. Sinclair was further astonished. That is, the secret to regaining her health was simple fasting therapy. Through an 8-day fast, she not only overcame all her chronic ailments but also had her eldest son and a friend practice the fasting method, curing their nervous indigestion. From this, Mr. Sinclair further studied various books on the fasting method and finally decided to undertake it himself, initially fasting for 12 days. Regarding the process, he described it as follows:

On the first day, I felt intense hunger. That is, I felt the unhealthy, unbearable hunger that many stomach patients feel. On the morning of the second day, I also felt slight hunger, but one thing that surprised me was that thereafter, I felt no hunger at all, and it reached a point where I felt no interest whatsoever in food, as if I had never known its taste. Before the fast, I felt a headache daily, but from the second day after fasting, it completely disappeared, reaching a point where it never recurred. On the second day, I felt very weak and experienced slight dizziness upon standing up. I went outdoors and spent the whole day bathing in the sun while reading. The third and fourth days passed similarly; my body was extremely fatigued, but my mind was very clear. On the fifth day, I gradually felt stronger, started walking, and began reading again. What was surprising during this experiment was that the mind became particularly active.<106> I read books and wrote compositions, things I hadn't dared to do for years.

During the first 4 days, my body weight decreased by 15 pounds. Later, I realized this was because my tissues were extremely poor. In contrast to this, what could be called an equally extraordinary phenomenon was that over the following 8 days, I lost only 2 pounds. During the fast, I slept well. Around midday each day, I felt weak, but massage and hydrotherapy refreshed my spirits. Later, even walking made my legs feel tired, but because I did not want to resort to bed rest, after 12 days passed, I consumed a small amount of orange juice liquid and hereby ended the fast.

For the first two days, I consumed the juice of 12 oranges, but upon someone's recommendation, I switched to using milk. On the first day, I consumed one cup of warm milk every hour, the next day divided it every 45 minutes, and later consumed it every half hour, using over 5 *seung* (approx. 9 liters) a day, it is said. Through fasting therapy, he completely cured his stomach illness and headaches, and now his flesh and bones are abundant, giving the impression of surpassing a strong man. However, his fast was not yet a complete fast. A complete fast means continuing the fast until the appetite returns. He subsequently attempted fasting again, but did not feel the weakness as he did the first time. He took cold baths twice a day, exercised 4 miles every morning, and stopped fasting after 8 days. During that time, his body weight decreased by 9 pounds, but he recovered this immediately after eating oranges and figs. In any case, the fact that Mr. Sinclair treated his serious illness with fasting therapy cannot but serve as reference material for us. According to the explanation of proponents of fasting therapy, ordinary people overeat, providing excessive nutrition to the body, and ferment toxins to such an extent that the various excretory organs cannot expel them. As a result, problems arise in the excretory organs and blood vessels, causing various symptoms like headaches, rheumatism, paralysis, stroke, nephritis, etc. It also harms the blood, reduces vitality, and makes one susceptible to infectious diseases such as colds, pneumonia, tuberculosis, fevers, etc. However, when one starts fasting and endures the final hunger, the secretion function stops, and the entire assimilative system, which consumes much of the body's energy, rests. It is just like performing a major cleanup of the four limbs. Therefore, to assist this, enemas and water baths are suitable, and drinking a large amount of water is appropriate. Until the toxic substances are completely expelled, the tongue remains coated, and one experiences foul breath and sweating. Finally, the tongue becomes clear, and a healthy appetite regenerates. The weight loss during fasting is typically about one pound per day; fat decreases first, followed by muscle. True <107> death by starvation refers to the state after the body has become entirely skeleton and internal organs. Fasting for 40 or even 50 days is a common occurrence today and not at all strange. Mr. Sinclair knows several practitioners. According to what he has heard, the longest fasting person fasted for 72 days.

Also mysterious is the fact that fasting results in curative effects for both the emaciated and the obese simultaneously.

There are two dangers to be wary of during fasting. The first is the danger of developing fear. No one should undertake fasting until they have conducted sufficient research and possess firm conviction. While Mr. Sinclair was in California, he fasted for 3 days and exercised 15 miles for 3 days. Feeling mentally refreshed, he returned home in the evening and encountered news of the great Italian earthquake. When rescue ships arrived at Messina Port, the surviving citizens, unbearable from hunger, were in a frenzy, presenting a scene akin to wild beasts trampling and devouring each other. The newspaper described the tragic situation, stating they had not eaten for 72 hours. However, Mr. Sinclair, reading that newspaper, laughed at himself for being perfectly fine despite also not eating for the same 72 hours. There was no other reason than this: the citizens of Messina were driven by the thought of fear, going mad as they approached starvation, while Mr. Sinclair, through the power of belief, was confident that fasting was the shortcut to healing. That is, a person informed by the knowledge of experience believes they will not die even if they fast for several days, while others, ignorant of that truth, act blindly and fall into the path of hungry ghosts while still alive. The maxim "The wise are not confused, the brave are not afraid" can only be truly understood by those with knowledge and cultivation.

The second danger lies in the timing of stopping the fast. Mr. Sinclair knew a person who, after fasting for 50 days, ate 6 figs and damaged their intestines, bleeding profusely. However, if a person consumes one cup of milk every half hour, they will not feel hunger and will gradually return to their previous state, avoiding the aforementioned danger. And so, he further presented the experiences of 7 other people to prove this, publishing accounts of treating stomach ailments and other diseases like tuberculosis.<108>
<105-108>

**Summary**

This 1920 article from the Korean magazine *Gaebyeok* introduces fasting therapy through the experiences of an American named Sinclair (likely Upton Sinclair). It details his struggles with chronic illness, his exploration of other health methods like Fletcherism (thorough chewing), and his eventual adoption of fasting after encountering a woman dramatically cured by it. The article describes Sinclair's own 12-day fast, noting initial hunger followed by its disappearance, increased mental clarity despite physical weakness, and significant initial weight loss. It explains the purported mechanism of fasting – resting the digestive system to allow the body to eliminate toxins accumulated from overeating – and mentions the necessity of careful refeeding. The dangers of fear and improper fast-breaking are highlighted, contrasting Sinclair's informed approach with the panicked starvation of Messina earthquake survivors.

From a historical perspective, this article is interesting as it shows the keen interest among Korean intellectuals during the colonial period in Western health fads and alternative medicine, presented as modern or scientific paths to self-improvement and physical strength. The detailed account of Sinclair's regimen, including specific durations, symptoms, and recovery foods (orange juice, milk), reflects a desire for practical, replicable knowledge. For historians, it highlights the transnational flow of ideas about health and the body, the specific health concerns prevalent at the time (digestive issues, neurasthenia), and the adoption of Western figures and methods as models in a colonial context, possibly seeking empowerment through personal health management.

米人 신꾸레열氏의 斷食療法
일즉 英國 近時 評論中에 米人 신꾸레열氏의 「完全한 健康」이라 題한 論文 1篇이 잇섯는데 그 大意는 自家의 實驗 及 觀察을 開陳하야 完全한 健康을 得한 手段을 記述한 것이라. 此 一文은 大히 注意를 拂할 價値가 有함으로 그 論文의 大畧을 抄出하야 別題의 下에 此를 讀者에 紹介하노라.
氏는 元來- 良家에 生하야 天性이 健全한 人이엇스나 著作에 從事함으로부터 過度히 精神을 苦惱케한 結果- 胃病에 걸리고 頭痛이 나고 感冒에 犯하엿섯다. 數人의 醫者를 請하야 藥餌를 施하고 署中- 海濱에 赴하야 療養을 不怠하엿스나 아모 效力을 엇지 못하엿다. 더구나 그 妻- 또한 身體- 健全치 못하야 每周 苦痛을 感함이 甚하엿스며 小兒가 또한 肺炎에 罹하야 數年來- 呻吟中에 잇섯슴으로 氏는 此에 여러 가지로 硏究하되 엇지하면 世에 完全한 健康의 道가 업슬가하고 種種의 方法으로 하야 보앗다. 當時에 후레쓰쟈-氏의 衛生法이 流行하엿는데 氏의 秘法으로 말하면 即 完全히 食物을 咀嚼하야 食物의 各 部分으로부터 될 수 잇는 限度는 養分을 吸收하야 그를 實際肉體의 需要할 만큼 食함이 可하다 함이라. 신꾸레열氏는 一時- 此 方法에 心醉한 일도 잇섯다. 何故오 하면 醫者의 療法은 다만 發病後 手段뿐이오 疾病을 豫防함에는 時期- 已晩함에 伴하야 후레쓰쟈-氏의＜105＞ 秘法은 此를 豫防하고 且 健康을 保持케하는 最良 手段이라 思하엿슴으로써라. 彼는 此로 因하야 能히 病原의 存한 바를 알엇다. 卽 여러 가지 病原은 過食한 不消貨物로부터 生한 毒의 停滯에 在함이라 하엿다. 故로 食物의 分量을 正確히 肉體의 需要에 適應케 함은 完全한 健康을 엇는 祕訣로 알엇다. 그러나 氏는 그 秘法에 因하야 그 病을 治療하지 못하엿다. 是에서 又 種種의 硏究를 施凝하야 水療法을 施하엿스나 다만 一時의 効가 有할 뿐으로 胃病은 依然히 存在하엿다. 又 種種의 運動術로써 試하야스나 是皆 一時의 効-뿐이엇섯다. 然한데 此時에 際하야 彼는 一日에 身體健全하야 可羡할 만한 强壯의 一婦人을 邂逅한 일이 잇다. 그 婦人은 10年 以前까지는 病床에서 四節呻吟하던 虛弱의 婦人이엇던 事를 知하고는 一驚을 喫하엿다. 그 婦人은 當時- 挫骨神經痛, 急性僂麻質斯, 慢性胃病, 神經衰弱, 憂鬱症 等 諸病에 苦惱하던 婦人이엇스나 今은 容貌血色이 非常히 充溢하엿다. 그 婦人은 신꾸레열氏와 共히 6時間 馬上에서 28哩를 旅行하야 가리후오니야州 하밀톤 山頂에 登하엿다. 그리하야 彼는 4個月 以前부터 一切 絶食하야 1片의 食物도 不食하엿다함에 至하야 氏는 更히 一驚하엿다. 卽 彼의 健康을 回腹한 祕訣은 單純한 斷食療法이엇다. 彼는 8日間 斷食에 말미어 一切의 持病을 解脫하엿슬 뿐 아니라 其他 其女의 長男 及 一友人에게도 斷食法을 行케하야 彼等의 神經質的 不消化病을 平癒케하엿다. 是에서 신꾸레열氏는 更히 斷食法에 就하야 種種의 書를 涉獵하야 終에 此를 斷行할 意를 決하고 最初 12日間 斷食을 行하엿다. 氏는 그 經過에 就하야 左와 如히 記述하엿다.
余는 初日에 甚히 飢餓를 感하엿노라. 即 여러 胃病患者가 感하는 바의 不健全으로 堪키 難한 飢餓를 覺하엿노라. 第2日의 朝도 少히 飢餓를 感하엿스나 余의 驚할 만한 一事는 爾後 一切 飢餓를 不感하고 일즉 食物의 味를 不知한 者와 如히 此에 就하야 何等 興味를 不感함에 至한 事이다. 斷食 以前에는 每日 頭痛을 感하엿스나 斷食後 第2日부터는 全히 消失하야 永遠 再發이 無함에 至하엿다. 第2日- 余는 甚히 衰弱을 覺하고 起身에 少히 眩暈을 感하엿다. 余는 戶外에 出하야 終日 太陽에 浴하면서 讀書하엿다. 第3日 第4日을 同樣으로 經過하니 肉體는 非常히 疲勞하엿스나 精神은 甚히 透明하엿다. 第5日에는 차츰 强氣가 나는 듯하야 步行도 하고 又 讀書를 始作하엿다. 此 實驗中에는 可驚할 事는 精神이 特히 活潑하야지는＜106＞ 것이엇다. 余는 年來- 不敢하던 讀書와 又 文을 作하엿다.
最初의 4日間은 身體의 重量- 15磅을 生하엿다. 後에 此는 余의 纖維가 極히 貧弱하엿던 것임을 알엇다. 此에 對하야 同樣으로 非常의 現象이라 할 만한 것은 爾後 8日間에는 겨우 2磅을 減할 뿐이다. 斷食中- 余는 善히 睡眠하엿다. 每日 晝頃에는 衰弱을 感하엿스나 按摩 及 灌水法에 依하야 心氣를 爽快케 하엿다. 後에는 步行에도 足의 疲勞를 覺하엿스나 余는 臥床에 就함을 不欲한 故로 12日을 經한 後- 小量의 香橙汁의 液을 用하고 玆에 斷食을 解止하엿다.
最初의 2日間 余는 12箇의 橙汁을 用하엿스나 或 人의 勸告에 依하야 牛乳를 用키로 되엇다. 第1日은 1時間마다 1盃의 溫乳를 用하고 次日에는 45分마다 此를 分하고 後에는 半時間마다 此를 用하야 1일 5升 以上을 用하엿다 한다. 彼는 斷食療法에 依하야 胃病 及 頭痛을 全治하고 今은 皮骨이 豊富하야 壯士를 凌하는 感이 잇다. 然이나 彼의 斷食은 아즉 完全한 斷食은 아니엇다. 完全한 斷食이라 함은 食欲이 再歸할 때까지 斷食을 繼續하는 것이라. 彼는 因하야 再度 斷食을 試하엿스나 第1回와 如히 衰弱을 感치 아니하엿다. 彼는 1日 2回 冷水浴을 하고 每朝 4哩 運動을 하야 8日만에 斷食을 中止하엿스나 그 間에 身體重量은 9磅을 減하엿는데 香橙及 無花果를 食하고 直히 此를 恢復하엿다. 如何튼지 氏는 斷食療法으로 그의 重病을 治한 事實은 吾人으로 一叅考의 材料가 되지 아니치 못하겟다. 斷食療法- 主張者의 說明에 依하면 普通 世人은 過食하야 體內에 過度한 營養을 與하고 排泄諸機關이 排泄이 不能하리만치 毒을 醱酵하야 그 結果는 排泄機關 及 血管에 故障이 生하야 頭痛, 僂麻質斯, 痲痺, 卒中, 腎藏炎 等 諸症을 發하고 又 血液을 害하며 活力을 減하며 寒冒, 肺炎 結核, 熱病 等의 傳染症에 感染키 易하나니라. 然한데 斷食을 始하야 最終에 饑餓를 堪하면 分泌作用이 止하고 肉體의 精力을 大히 耗하는 同化機關이 全部 休息하야 恰然히 四體의 大掃除를 行함과 如한 故로 此를 補助함에 灌膓水浴으로써 하며 又 多量의 水를 飮함이 適하며 全혀 毒物을 排泄하야 마치기까지는 舌粘이 着하고 醜惡한 呼吸 及 發汗을 爲하야 最後에는 舌이 淸하며 健全한 食欲이 再生하는 것이라. 斷食中 重量의 減少는 一目 約一磅이 通例이니 脂肪이 先減하야 次에 筋肉에 及하는 것이다. 眞의＜107＞ 餓死라함은 肉體가 全히 骸骨과 內臟뿐 된 以後의 事를 云함이니 40日 乃至 50日의 斷食은 今日 通常의 事로 足히 怪할 바 아니로다. 신꾸레열氏는 그 實行者 數人을 知한다. 彼의 聞知한 바에 依하면 最長者가 72日 斷食한 人이라 云하더라.
又 不思議한 것은 斷食의 結果가 瘐衰한 者이나 肥滿한 者나 同時에 治療의 效能이 有한 事이다.
斷食中 警戒할 만한 2個의 危險이 有하니 第1은 恐怖念을 發하는 危險이 是라. 何人이던지 十分 硏究를 致하야 確信을 有하기까지는 斷食을 行함이 不可하니 신꾸레열氏는 加洲에 在하야 3日間- 絶食을 하고 3日間 15哩 運動을 하야 精神의 爽快를 感하면서 日夕에 歸宅하야 伊太利 大地震의 新聞을 接하니 救助船이 메쓰지나 港에 着하매 生殘한 市民은 饑餓에서 不堪하야 狂亂함이 恰然히 猛獸 相蹈相呑하는 狀을 呈하엿는데 新聞에는 彼等이 72時間 食을 不得하엿다는 慘狀을 記述하엿다. 然한데 彼新聞을 讀하는 氏는 同一히 72時를 不食하고도 平然함을 自笑하엿나니 無他라 메쓰시나 市民은 恐怖의 念에 被驅하야 餓死에 瀕함을 狂亂함이오. 氏는 信力에 依하야 斷食은 療症의 捿徑이라 自信하엿슴으로써라. 即 實驗의 知識에 因한 人은 數日 絶食할지라도 死치 아니함을 信하고 他는 그 眞理를 不知함으로 盲動하야 生하야서 이미 餓鬼道에 墮落하는 것이라. 智者不惑勇者不懼의 格言은 知識이 有하고 修養이 有한 者라야 처음으로 解得할이니라.
第2의 危險은 斷食을 停止하는 時에 在하니 氏는 50日間ㅣ斷食하야 6個의 無花果를 食하고 膓을 毁하야 多量으로 出血한 人을 知하엿다. 然이나 人이 만일 半時間마다 一盃 牛乳를 用하면 饑餓를 感치 아니하고 漸次 狀態에 復하야 以上의 危險을 免하리라. 그리하야 彼는 更히 7人의 實驗談을 揭하야 此를 證明하야 胃病外 其他 結核症 諸病을 治療한 事를 揭載하엿더라.＜108＞
