Having anxiously awaited the arrival of the dear one called Opportunity, staying awake for several nights,
Fatigue and sleepiness rushed in, and tonight, sleep was fallen into.

The anxiously awaited dear one came without a sound,
But they did not wake up, snoring,
"Not yet, not yet," muttering sleep-talk, they sleep.

Calling out, "The time has come, wake up..."
The dear one's song flows away along with their deep dreams.

At last, the dear one stood up to leave.
For some reason, they woke up,
Rubbing their eyes in the darkness, saying, "Did they perhaps not come?"

Ah, you who were waiting, they are beside you! Light the lamp!
Quickly light the lamp and grasp the dear one's wrist! The dear one intends to leave right now.

You who search in the darkness, you who were waiting, do not lose the dear one,
Light the lamp with your life! Quickly light the bright red lamp!<1>

**Summary**

This poem personifies "Opportunity" (時機, Sigi) as a "dear one" (님, nim) whom the narrator anxiously awaits. However, the narrator falls asleep just as Opportunity arrives silently. Despite Opportunity's call to awaken, the narrator remains asleep, murmuring "not yet." Only as Opportunity prepares to leave does the narrator wake up, disoriented in the dark. The poem concludes with an urgent plea to light a lamp—even with one's own life—and seize Opportunity before it disappears. From a historical perspective, published in 1920 in the nationalist magazine *Kaebyŏk*, the poem is a poignant allegory for Korea under colonial rule. It urges the Korean people (the waiting person) to wake from passivity, recognize the fleeting chance for action or liberation (Opportunity/Nim), and act decisively ("light the lamp") before the moment is lost, possibly referencing the need to rekindle the spirit of movements like the recent March 1st Uprising. Historians may find it valuable as it reflects the urgency and metaphorical language used to express nationalist aspirations under censorship.

권두시
時機라는 님이 오기를 苦待하고 몃칠밤 안자고 새이다가
疲困과 睡眠이 몰려와서 이 밤엔 잠이 들엇다
苦待하는 님은 소리업시 와서
그러나 그는 잠이 깨지 아니하야 코를 골면서
「아니오나 아니오나」잠꼬대하면서 잔다
「때도 오다 일어나라…」하고 부르는
님의 노래 소리는 그의 깁흔 꿈과 한께 흘러간다
하다못하야 님은 가랴고 일어섯다
무슨 動機론지 그는 잠이 깨여서
어둔 속에서 눈을 부비면서 「그저 아니왓나」한다
아아 기다리던 자여 네엽헤 잇다 燈불을 켜라
빨리 불을 켜고 님의 손목을 잡어라 님은 只今 가려 한다
어둔 속에서 찻는 者야 기다리던 者야 님을 노치지 말고
너의 生命으로 불을 켜라 새빩안 불을 빨리 켜라＜1＞
