Gathering the Veritable Records of Duke Ch'ungdal
						Min Yŏng-sun

The Master's Poem
In the year Byŏngsul (1886), the year after the Master went into exile in Japan, in the 8th month, upon returning from Ise Mountain to Ogasawara Island, he composed a poem and showed it to his friends, saying:
Confined in gloom on Mount Ise,
Heaven kindly granted a favorable east wind,
It hinders not being pushed, bound, out of the capital's gates.
A thousand *li* to Ogasawara, returned in a single day.

The Master's Writing
At this time, seeing that the matter of the assassin Chi Un-yŏng had been exposed, the Master consequently presented a letter to King Gojong (Yi T'aewang), saying:
Your humble servant, Kim Ok-kyun, with sincere reverence and fear, bowing my head a hundred times,
Reports to His Majesty the King. It has been long since your servant wished to relate his trifling sorrows and trouble the sacred hearing, but hearing that the will of Heaven was angered and that there would soon be an excessive action, I lacked the opportunity and thus have reached this day. However, recently, a person named Chi Un-yŏng suddenly came to Tokyo, Japan, and made an agreement with certain Japanese, saying: "Chi Un-yŏng, Chief of Military Affairs of the Great Chosŏn Kingdom, having received a special command from the Great Monarch, has brought a letter of commission as Plenipotentiary Ambassador for Capturing Rebels. If you act on my behalf and execute the rebel Kim Ok-kyun <76>, I promise a reward of 5,000 Won within 5 days after its success. If the deadline passes and the reward is not given, you may use the personally written letter of commission I brought to appeal to the Chosŏn government and immediately claim that amount." Hearing this, your servant could not contain his astonishment and explored the circumstances in various ways, roughly ascertaining Chi Un-yŏng's movements. Herein, I dare to submit this sealed report, risking offense to your dignity. Humbly considering, allowing the likes of Chi Un-yŏng to come overseas, recklessly claim a royal command, and lightly make such treaties, does this not greatly injure Your Majesty's prestigious virtue? Is the letter of commission carried by Chi Un-yŏng truly one personally granted by Your Majesty? Your servant does not know this, but its text says:
"Ordering you as a specially dispatched envoy crossing the sea to capture rebels, granting full authority for ad-hoc planning, acting for the state's affairs also with full power, do not fail in this undertaking." It is stamped with the Great Monarch's Royal Seal above the date. Your servant heard last year, while in Kobe, Japan, that a man named Chang Kap-pok also claimed to have received such a letter of commission within sight of the Heavenly authority. Regarding the letters of commission carried by the likes of Chang Kap-pok and Chi Un-yŏng, I do not know if they were privately forged, but if, unfortunately, they were truly personally granted by Your Majesty, although your servant is a wanderer in a foreign land, I cannot but offer a word of remonstrance for Your Majesty's sake. I know not what kind of persons Your Majesty considered Chang Kap-pok and Chi Un-yŏng to be, to personally grant such important letters of commission. If this letter of commission comes into contact with foreign eyes and ears, there is concern that this matter might suddenly become known throughout the world; your servant truly cannot bear the painful regret and tears. Therefore, I endeavored to retrieve his letter of commission so that this would not spread in the world. Humbly considering, Your Majesty occupies the throne of ten thousand chariots, has become the parent of the people, and have You not broadly established treaties of intercourse with all nations under Heaven? How could You perform such a rash act, damaging the national standing and sullying Your prestigious virtue? The world today is not like the past; various countries mutually spy on each other's weaknesses, and ascertaining another country's internal affairs is like looking at one's palm. Your servant earnestly hopes that Your Majesty will reflect upon the sacred intention. Your servant also wishes to separately state his personal feelings and appeal to Your Majesty's clear judgment. If Your Majesty adds the name of 'rebel' to your servant, for what crime is this done? I humbly think this does not entirely originate from Your Majesty's sacred will, but surely from treacherous ministers seeking to indulge in cruel and baseless actions due to their own suspicions. However, Your Majesty is an intelligent monarch, and even if treacherous types fabricate slander, I know it cannot obscure Your sacred intelligence, hence your servant dares not require many words. Only, regarding last year's affair, although some in the world criticize it as being too close to <68> radicalism, may Your Majesty please try to reflect deeply. In our country, concerning the Min clan, for twenty long years, those with the surname Min, regardless of their wisdom or foolishness, have been trusted and relied upon as limbs and confidants. But among the Min clan, how many have truly been able to respond to Your Majesty's sacred will, implement policies that bring benefit to the people, and devise plans to lead the nation and state to wealth and strength? Many are criminals who sell the country, some seeking to borrow the power of Qing officials to scorn our national sovereignty. Other numerous crimes are difficult to enumerate one by one, and moreover, treacherous ministers relying on the favor of the Queen (坤殿) and daring to obscure the sacred intelligence, seeking to ruin state affairs, are also not few. Your Majesty has long worried deeply about this, secretly instructing your servant to devise a plan to eliminate them, and your servant, moved to tears, has also submitted memorials. Your servant believed that if such treacherous elements were not eradicated now, it would be impossible to prevent Your Majesty from becoming the monarch of a ruined state for a thousand generations. Thus, for the sake of the nation, I risked my life and undertook the affair. Now, turning against your servant and calling me a rebel, what is the reason? Your servant knows this is surely not Your Majesty's sacred will. Some criticize us for relying on foreign power at that time, but this arose from unavoidable circumstances both internal and external at the time, as Your Majesty well knows. That your servant wanders in a foreign land, barely preserving his remaining life, is truly not my original intention. Pondering quietly, although your servant was foolish and failed to fully realize his long-held aspirations for the sovereign and the state in the past, I believe I have fulfilled the duty of a subject. Thus, wishing to hide my name from the world and pass my remaining years is indeed my resolve. However, treacherous ministers, recklessly anticipating the sacred will, seek to plot for the profit of their own families, not hesitating to fabricate lies. What is most severe is being deceived by Chang Kap-pok last winter, leading to stirring up three countries with child's play-like talk and causing harm to the populace; for this, your servant cannot cease grieving for Your Majesty. Humbly wishing that Your Majesty, from now on, dispel useless suspicions, not be confused by the slander of treacherous ministers, deeply deliberate on the state's grand strategy, prevent disasters before they arise, and ensure that the foundation of the five-hundred-year dynasty established by the ancestors does not fall into ruin. Now, the world situation changes daily and monthly, making it impossible to feel secure even for a moment. The three islands of Chŏlla Province, namely Kŏmun Island, have already been seized by Great Britain. The overturned cart's tracks are right here; what does Your Majesty intend to do? What plans do the ministers currently in court truly have? Your servant cannot know this, but in today's Chosŏn, how many people actually know the name of Great Britain? Even if you ask the ministers in court where Great Britain is, there are often many who are bewildered and unable to answer. <69> To use an analogy, it is as if something comes and bites my limb, yet I not only fail to feel the pain but also do not know what bit me. Discussing the survival or fall of such a nation is like talking about a fool's dream, hardly anything to be surprised about. The situation being thus, what measures does Your Majesty have to avoid becoming the ruler of a ruined state? What measures do those who are Your Majesty's confidants and limbs have to secure the nation's peace for Your Majesty? Today is not a time to merely seek comfort in momentary pleasures. Also, although Qing China interferes in all matters of the Chosŏn state, acting as if responsible for protection, it cannot recover Kŏmun Island and preserve the territory for Chosŏn. If, in the future, another foreign power seizes another port, what does Your Majesty intend to do, and what methods will Qing China use to instruct us? According to what your servant has heard, Qing China once informed our country, saying: "Great Britain has very extensive vassal territories and has no spare capacity to manage our country separately. Furthermore, as there is a situation where they intend to go to war with Russia, they unavoidably occupied Kŏmun Island temporarily. Therefore, it is not something Chosŏn should worry about in the slightest." At that time, upon hearing these words, your servant could not contain his indignation inwardly. Now, if Great Britain occupies a port fearing war with Russia, it is clearer than looking at fire that Russia will also occupy a port fearing war with Great Britain. Even if, by chance, the world remains peaceful and Britain and Russia do not contend in the East, let Your Majesty try putting yourself in the position of the rulers of Britain, France, Germany, or Russia and consider this. If there were a country here that I could take without the slightest resistance, what would Your Majesty indeed intend to do? Today's Chosŏn is precisely that. Yet, the ministers in court have not a single plan to maintain the nation, only engaging in selling offices and bribery, brutalizing the people, appointing officials without regard to wisdom or foolishness, merely distinguishing by saying 'Who is of the Taewŏn'gun's faction?' 'Who is of Kim Ok-kyun's faction?', acting based on child's play-like talk. How can this be a long-term strategy for the nation? Furthermore, those treacherous ministers, taking advantage of your servant's presence in a neighboring country, indulge in slander and deceit to plot for their private family interests, killing innocent people and seizing property in no small number. What is even worse is that the current affair has caused trouble to reach Your Majesty; your servant truly does not know what to say. Does Your Majesty intend to listen to the words of treacherous villains and carry out unclear measures? Because of this, the suspicions of the ignorant populace grow, eventually leading to disturbances in the world; this is what Your Majesty should deeply worry about. Furthermore, even the Japanese government would not engage in such unjust acts as lending troops to foreigners to cause unrest in a neighboring country. As your servant has detailed above, from the beginning, I only exhausted my spirit <70> for the sake of the people. I have never dared to commit violent acts and inflict suffering on the people. I wish Your Majesty would announce this within the country to seek the stabilization of public sentiment. Also, there is another rumor that Li Hung-chang made an agreement with the Japanese government, plotting to send assassins to harm your servant, and that the Japanese government not only looked the other way but even showed signs of protecting the assassins, the evidence of which is already clear. However, your servant does not believe this. Why? Even if the Japanese government regretted interfering in Chosŏn's affairs in the past and intended to kill your servant to silence me, it is unreasonable for the government of a dignified nation to make such a childish treaty. Li Hung-chang, too, as a great minister of a nation, how could he lightly do something that invites ridicule? This likely originates from youngsters like Yuan Shih-k'ai, merely eager to secure their own merits, recklessly trying to deceive Your Majesty. May Your Majesty fortunately not fall into their trap. Considering, if Qing China truly wished to plan for our country, it should be able to understand the trends of the times, select someone intelligent and knowledgeable, send them to our country, and guide us. Yet, they do not do this, instead dispatching someone like Yuan Shih-k'ai, whose mouth still smells of milk and who cannot discern the times, and pay no heed; your servant cannot understand their intention. Yuan Shih-k'ai is originally a petty man of small measure, only hoping to gain the favor of Your Majesty and the Queen to be recommended to Li Hung-chang. He cannot even plan for his own self, how could he have the leisure to plan for Your Majesty? Although your servant is foolish, knowing Qing's greatness and its lip-and-teeth relationship with us, I know that deliberately becoming distant from them is not a good strategy. However, Your Majesty's treacherous ministers form cliques with ignorant gangs like Yuan Shih-k'ai et al., scorning national sovereignty; this is something your servant cannot sit by and watch. Now, planning for Chosŏn, Qing China is inherently unreliable, and Japan is also the same. These two countries seem to lack the surplus strength to maintain themselves, how could they have the leisure to assist another country? In recent years, when other countries occupied Qing's Annam and Ryukyu, Qing did not dare to attempt a single word of resistance. Claiming they will enable our country to rest easy with a high pillow is truly laughable. Japan, for some reason since previous years, interfered in our country's affairs with temporary enthusiasm, but after a change, suddenly abandoned it, seeming not to care; thus, it too cannot be relied upon. Indeed, what should be done then? Only by outwardly cultivating close relations with European and American countries through faith and righteousness, and inwardly reforming political strategy, educating the ignorant populace with the way of civilization, promoting commerce to organize finances, and also raising troops, which is not difficult. If we can truly do thus, Great Britain will return Kŏmun Island, and other foreign countries will also <71> cease their thoughts of aggression. Now, our country's population exceeds 20,000,000, and concerning products, even if we lack refined man-made goods, regarding natural resources, there are many that are far superior compared to Japan and Northern China. Among these, the various metal mines are too numerous to count. To take such inherent rich resources and entrust them to other countries is something your servant cannot restrain his grief over. Based on many years of observation, your servant has submitted memorials to Your Majesty; does Your Majesty remember them? The point is the eradication of the so-called *yangban* (nobility) in our country today. In our country before the middle period, when the nation's fortune prospered, all kinds of tools and products surpassed those of the three East Asian countries. Now, they have totally fallen into disuse, leaving not even a trace, for no other reason than the rampant tyranny of the *yangban*. If the people produce one item, the *yangban* officials seize it laterally. If the commoners work hard and accumulate pennies, the *yangban* officials come and plunder them. Therefore, the people say, "If we try to make our own living by our own efforts, not only do the *yangban* officials absorb the profits, but in severe cases, there is fear of losing precious life. It is better to abandon the various occupations of farming, commerce, and crafts to avoid danger." Consequently, idle people fill the entire country, and the national strength declines daily. At this time when the world now focuses on commerce and competes in the abundance of industry, if we do not strive to eliminate the *yangban* and eradicate the source of this evil, we can only await the nation's ruin and demise. May Your Majesty fortunately reflect deeply on this, swiftly dismiss the ignorant, incapable, conservative, and stubborn great ministers and assistant councilors, abolish the clan-based system, select talented individuals, establish the foundation of centralized power, gain the trust of the people, widely establish schools to develop people's intelligence, and inviting foreign religions to aid enlightenment is also one method. The Taewŏn'gun originally did not understand the world situation, which led to his stubborn actions one morning in the past. But today, there are signs that he regrets this, and he is someone the people's hearts depend on. Therefore, I wish you would entrust him temporarily with the full authority of the state. If he commits errors, Your Majesty can wield sovereign power to correct them yourself; this might be one strategy to save the current crisis. Furthermore, the ten or so individuals who fled overseas with your servant are all loyal and upright persons. If Your Majesty recalls them to the home country, employs them, and entrusts them with political affairs, your servant guarantees they are capable of handling state matters in the future. Pak Yŏng-hyo, Sŏ Kwang-bŏm, and Sŏ Chae-p'il are three individuals who are young and vigorous, loyal, have experienced hardships, and are capable of observing foreign situations. If Your Majesty swiftly recalls and trusts them, they will become pillars of the state. Who among the nations of the world would not praise Your Majesty's sacred virtue? As for dealing with your servant, simply clearing the baseless <72> criminal charge would be said to follow the public opinion of the world. Your servant swears to Heaven and Earth that I have no desire for renewed honor and favor. May Your Majesty truly understand this. Also, regarding individuals like Chang Kap-pok and Chi Un-yŏng, it is unnecessary to execute them. Although they are not without great crimes, if they had not been given an opportunity from the start, how could they have managed to deceive the sacred hearing and damage the sacred virtue? I wish Your Majesty, with the benevolence of the Heavenly Father, would accept your servant's foolishly direct words; I cease not to pray and implore this, holding my breath ten thousand times.

The Master's Letter
In the 6th month of Byŏngsul (1886), he sent a letter to Li Hung-chang of Qing China, saying:
Kim Ok-kyun respectfully addresses His Excellency Li, Grand Secretary, First-Class Count Suyi of the Great Qing Empire. Ok-kyun is a fugitive scholar of Chosŏn. Regarding the outbreak of the incident in the capital city in the winter of Kapsin (1884), Ok-kyun was persecuted by petty men plotting disorder, his life was endangered, and having no alternative, he fled east with his belongings to Edo (Tokyo) in Japan, truly relying on the righteous spirit of the Japanese Minister Takezoe Shin'ichirō in saving people from dire straits. Since then, hearing various news coming from the west, a faction of treacherous partisans has seized the opportunity for private gain, fabricating accusations against Ok-kyun, even alleging the crime of treason, acting with arbitrary cruelty beyond all bounds, their serpentine venom seemingly insufficient. They then demanded from the Japanese government that Ok-kyun be arrested and returned. At this time, it was widely rumored that this was secretly instigated by China's Minister Li. Hearing this, Ok-kyun truly doubted it in his heart and wished to ask Your Excellency directly with a single word, but always worried that reliable means of communication were hard to find, only waiting. Now, quite unexpectedly, another strange and unspeakable event has occurred. From Chosŏn, someone named Chi Un-yŏng secretly entered Tokyo, Japan, his movements quite suspicious. Ok-kyun then consulted with several comrades, investigated his activities from beginning to end over a month, expending much effort and calculation, and finally, the so-called letter of commission and various documents, conclusive evidence, all fell into Ok-kyun's hands. Ok-kyun then realized that Chi Un-yŏng was an assassin plotting to murder Ok-kyun. Among those documents, it was mentioned that China's Minister Li had written to the Japanese court three or two times requesting the capture of Ok-kyun, that the Japanese court refused based on reason, but the third reply, although not agreeing to the capture and return, stated that if Koreans carried out an assassination, the Japanese court would remain uninvolved and certainly not hold anyone responsible. Minister Li, based on this, instructed Mr. Yuan [Shikai] to have our government dispatch strongmen, and the government subsequently selected Chi Un-yŏng and entrusted him with the mission. Seeing this, Ok-kyun was again filled with doubt, unable to comprehend Your Excellency's actions. Your Excellency is a great minister of a nation; the country's safety and danger somewhat depend on Your Excellency's single calculation's success or failure. Currently, Your Excellency is also diligent regarding Chosŏn, seemingly tireless, is it not because you consider the grand situation of East Asia as your responsibility? If so, Your Excellency's prestige is weighty in the world, the focus of the world's attention; what you bear is indeed significant. How could Your Excellency instigate the act of assassination with a hidden blade? Ok-kyun assumes this must be the work of young, ignorant types like Yuan Shih-k'ai, seeking to display their merits to the treacherous elements in Chosŏn, creating such childish affairs. What does Your Excellency think? If, unfortunately, this truly originates from Your Excellency's actions, since Your Excellency takes Chosŏn's affairs as your responsibility, you should select someone experienced in current affairs and knowledgeable in principles, send them, and advise with loyal words when appropriate. Instead of doing this, entrusting Yuan Shih-k'ai, a mere martial retainer still smelling of milk and ignorant, with great matters as if playing a game – Your Excellency using the nation of Chosŏn as a temporary expedient for your own schemes, I fear, may not necessarily be fortunate for your esteemed country, nor for East Asia. <73> How could Your Excellency do this? Furthermore, discussing the events of yesteryear, it was also Yuan Shih-k'ai and treacherous partisans who secretly plotted, rashly fired upon our Royal Palace first, turning a moment for quelling disorder into a battlefield. They, eager to cover their own crimes, misled our King's sacred heart, arbitrarily fabricating Ok-kyun's faults, and reported this to Your Excellency. Did Your Excellency truly believe it? Ok-kyun can discern that Your Excellency's anger towards Ok-kyun stems from borrowing Japanese military power; this indeed arose from the pressure of circumstances, an unavoidable measure. Ok-kyun roughly understands the great trends of the world, the relationships of benefit and harm. Your esteemed country's grand position in East Asia and our country naturally have a relationship like lips and teeth. How could Ok-kyun, for the sake of his insignificant self, rationally create friction between them? Since the changes of Imsin (壬申 likely error for 甲申 Kapsin or similar context) , worthless treacherous types have all flocked to Yuan Shih-k'ai and his ilk, secretly forming cliques, using [Chinese] authority to wield power, obstructing our King's intelligence, constraining national sovereignty, and manipulating government orders, leading the nation's situation daily towards collapse. At such a time, Ok-kyun wished to plead once with Your Excellency, painfully discussing the difficulties of the times, but was thoroughly thwarted by the multifaceted schemes of petty villains. Alas! Considering the national plan, I dared not sit idly by with folded hands, thus resorting to drastic measures as an emergency stratagem. However, certain plans were not implemented, and due to the interference of youngsters, the great undertaking collapsed midway – how lamentable! Your Excellency's insight should also allow for some tacit understanding. Ok-kyun reflects that although his initial intention for the country was not realized as wished, the duty of a subject has indeed been fulfilled. Thus, wishing to hide from the world and live out my remaining years, placing no importance on dangers or ease, just wandering freely beyond worldly affairs, finding joy in liberation. Yet, suddenly faced with today's events, Ok-kyun cannot but offer a word of loyal advice to Your Excellency. Your Excellency should be able to clearly understand Chosŏn's internal situation; its imminent collapse is already evident. Issues like financial difficulties, chaotic administration, and the people's suffering are too numerous and unbearable to mention to others. In such a precarious situation, like stacked eggs, seeking ways to recover and revitalize requires more than minor wisdom and ability. Does Your Excellency perhaps have a grand, safe plan that will ultimately not invite the world's ridicule? Since its survival or fall is linked to the peace of East Asia, merely clinging to the empty name of past relations, ignoring the present situation, and talking idly like in a dream, I fear, will ultimately prove unrealistic. Even if Chosŏn faces difficulties and conflicts, if Your Excellency's wisdom alone could provide consistent support, the fortune would be immense. However, reflecting on the situation of your esteemed country, citing one or two examples from past experiences, even Your Excellency cannot guarantee it. If so, why does Your Excellency not promote His Majesty the Emperor of Great Qing as the leader of an alliance under Heaven, promulgate public opinion among the great powers of Europe and America, connect with them, establish Chosŏn as a neutral nation, creating a perfectly safe land? If Your Excellency then follows up with experienced diplomacy, fully exercising neighborly friendship, firmly solidifying the alliance of mutual dependence (輔車之盟), and thereby unfolds an East Asian political strategy, this would not only be fortunate for Chosŏn but perhaps also the best policy for your esteemed country. What does Your Excellency think? Ok-kyun is already weary of the world and does not wish to discuss world affairs again. Yet, recalling my initial resolve, I earnestly reach this point without fatigue. Presenting this with solemn respect.
To His Excellency Li Shaoquan (李少荃 - Li Hongzhang's style name), Kim Ok-kyun bows twice and states.
Byŏngsul (丙戌), DB annotation 001) [Original text correction] 戍 → 戌 6th month, 6th day.

Excerpts Regarding the Master's Posthumous Appointment and Title Conferment
Posthumous Appointment: The late Vice Minister of Finance Kim Ok-kyun, having long harbored administrative talents and disdained career advancement, traveled abroad, thoroughly observed the world situation, repeatedly submitted insightful proposals, took upon himself the worries of the nation, and during the Kapsin (1884) year, resolved on reform, aiming to establish unprecedented achievements. However, the affair failed, and he hastily drifted to a neighboring land, enduring numerous hardships, ultimately losing his life. Yet his devoted thoughts never forgot the nation; he was truly the pioneer of restoration and the <74> forerunner of civilization. Although his case was clarified during the Kap-o (1894) year, there had yet been no decree of commendation and solace. Specially appoint him as Great Gwangbo Guk, Grand Tutor of the Kyujanggak. Regarding the conferment of a posthumous name, without waiting for the statement of deeds, the posthumous title延謚日(?) is granted, and send an attendant to conduct a memorial service. This order is respectfully received.

When sending an attendant for the memorial service at the shrine tablet of Duke Ch'ungdal Kim Ok-kyun, posthumously appointed Great Gwangbo Guk Sungrok Daebu, Grand Tutor of the Kyujanggak:
Officiant: Kim Yong-han, Attendant-in-Waiting, Attendant's Office

On the 21st day (Kyŏngsin) of the 6th month (Kiyu) of the 4th year of Yunghŭi (Gyeong-sul year, lunar calendar), I, Emperor, dispatch my servant Kim Yong-han, Attendant-in-Waiting of the Attendant's Office, to perform a memorial service before the spirit of Duke Ch'ungdal Kim Ok-kyun, posthumously appointed Great Gwangbo Guk Sungrok Daebu, Grand Tutor of the Kyujanggak.
The spirit of the peak gathers, special talent heavenly endowed, born this great man, to aid our imperial throne. The world's whole situation, insightfully grasped alone, brilliant talent aiding the age, outstanding hero knowing affairs. Amidst turbulent times, the nation's steps exceedingly difficult, aiming for one move, threw himself forth without regard. Pure loyalty, far-reaching strategy, expanding timely measures, changing strings, altering tracks, driving abreast, competing equally. Blue Heaven gave no aid, overturned by wind and rain, great river's boat and oars, drifted to the eastern shore. Long-held ambitions unfulfilled, illness worsened progressively, path exhausted, name weighty, misunderstood by the times. One thought of rectifying the nation, still tied, harboring sincerity. Poisonous arrow suddenly shot, phoenix tripped, overturned. Grievance reached upwards, spirits and ghosts also angered. Uniquely endowed with foresight, why this misfortune? Until now three decades, changes frequent, repeated. Nation received grand title, people shed stubborn ways. Who sang the first arrow's song? Who crossed the ferry point? Forever recalling, unforgettable, stroking the past, tracing back. Public case decided, news has number. Extending justice, rewarding merit, resonant decree proclaimed downward. Conferring posthumous title, granting rank, state rites hereby complete. The imperishable exists, may it accept the pure libation. (Yunghŭi 4th year, July 4th, Official Gazette)
Duke Kim Ch'ungdal's Title Conferment Ceremony
The ceremony for conferring the posthumous title upon Duke Ch'ungdal Kim Ok-kyun, as previously reported, was held yesterday at 2 PM at the site of Mr. Kim's former residence within the High School grounds. A tent was erected high at the ceremony site. In the center, the spirit tablet was placed. To the right, a photograph of Mr. Kim and a long scroll written on Ogasawara Island were hung. To the left, a scroll of the spirit path stele inscription, composed by Kŭmnŭngwi Pak Yŏng-hyo and written by Yŏngsŏn'gun Yi Chun-yong, was hung. In front of the spirit tablet, the sacrificial items bestowed by the Emperor were displayed. At the appointed time, the Imperial Envoy, Attendant-in-Waiting Kim Yong-han, faced east. After one ritual official stood on each side, one recited the imperially composed funeral oration, while the other two officials from the Institute of Rites recited the procedural notes in order, giving cues to the officiant. After the ceremony concluded, Mr. Kim's son, Yŏng-jin, performed incense burning and stood bowing. Next, Lieutenant Colonel Tsuno, attending as the representative of Resident-General <75> Terauchi, followed by Minister of Interior Pak representing the cabinet, Chairman Kim of the Privy Council representing the Lecture Alumni Association (講舊會), the wife of President Cho P'yo-hun representing the ladies, Chairman Yu of the Hansŏng Citizens' Association representing friends, and Mr. Minegishi Shigetarō representing Japanese friends, proceeded forward in order and stood bowing. The solemnity of the ceremony site and the mournful state of the attendees caused silent tears, mourning the heroic loyal soul. Here is a detailed report: △ Guests included: From the Imperial Family, Yŏngsŏn'gun; Resident-General's representative Lieutenant Colonel Tsuno; Lieutenant General Usagawa; From the Ministers' side, Minister of the Palace Min; Minister of Interior Pak; Minister of Agriculture, Commerce, and Industry Cho; Minister of Finance Ko; Minister of Education Yi; Chairman Kim of the Privy Council; Lord Steward Yun; Chief Secretary Cho of the Sŭngnyŏngbu; Chief Military Aide Yi; President Cho of the P'yohunwŏn; other senior statesmen; various noble ladies; officials appointed by imperial decree from various ministries, bureaus, offices, and agencies; patriots from various societies; From the Japanese side, civil and military officials; Secretary Kawakami; Minegishi, President of the Keijō Shimbun; other prominent gentlemen and merchants; totaling several hundred people. △ Sacrificial offerings funds: 100 Won bestowed by His Majesty the Retired Emperor; 20 Won contributed by Resident-General Terauchi; 100 Won for ceremony expenses from the Cabinet; 10 Won from Lieutenant General Usagawa; 10 Won from Vice Minister of Education Tawara; 10 Won from Vice Minister of the Palace Komiya; 10 Won from Vice Minister of Agriculture, Commerce, and Industry Kiuchi; 5 Won from Vice President Yoshiwara of the Oriental Development Company; 3 Won from Secretary Kawakami; totaling 268 Won. △ Representing Japanese friends, Mr. Minegishi Shigetarō lithographed several hundred copies of Duke Kim Ch'ungdal's handwritten letters and distributed them to the attendees. △ Minister of Agriculture Cho, sighing deeply over Duke Kim's heroic regrets, orally composed a quatrain and showed it to attendees. The poem reads: "Dragon vanished, tiger departed, the deep pool empty; Resentment chokes the hero whose merit went unsold. Today, try looking at the changing times; A hundred bodies cannot redeem the foolishness of old." △ Patriot Han Yŏng-wŏn brought a pot of clear wine and several lines of a memorial text to the ceremony site, wishing to personally mourn the loyal soul of the leader of the Korean reform party, the hero and outstanding talent. Although he obtained the approval of the chief mourner and senior statesmen, because the ceremony that day was an imperially bestowed rite, all private performances and libations were difficult to conduct concurrently. Therefore, his private memorial text was handed to Mr. Kim's son, Yŏng-jin, and the pot of wine he brought was separately offered to the senior statesmen. His private memorial text said: "Junior Han Yŏng-wŏn respectfully presents clear wine and offers these humble words, bowing twice reverently before the spirit of Duke Ch'ungdal, the old pine Kim Sŏnsaeng: Alas! Heaven and Earth endure, but the man is not constant, yet his will remains unfulfilled. Sun and moon shine brightly, but the man is seen no more, yet his name grows more illustrious. Look upon this remaining land of Tan'gun, Kija, Silla, Koryŏ; the heroic spirit has not vanished, sprinkling our fifteen million tears; the multitude's hearts grieve in vain." △ After the ceremony, in the rest area, while senior statesmen chatted over tea, pastries, wine, and tobacco, it was proposed that since this site is Mr. Kim's former residence, the school currently located here should be moved elsewhere, and this site be given to Mr. Kim's son. It was also decided that after deducting various expenses from the total funds received (268 Won, including the imperially bestowed offering money and contributions from others), the remainder would be deposited in a bank to erect a stone monument later. (July X, Yunghŭi 4th year, Taehan Sinmun)
Postscript: To obtain the Master's veritable records, I first visited not just one or two places, but several elder statesmen (大監) and gentlemen (紳士) who had deep connections with the Master at the time. However, everywhere I went, I met with frustration. Finally, managing to gather two or three extant writings from Japanese hands, while printing them for introduction, fortunately, I received from the Master's son, Mr. Kim Yŏng-jin, Governor of Poryŏng County, a copy of "Kim Ok-kyun" published in Taishō 4 (1915) and articles about the posthumous appointment and title conferment from Yunghŭi 4 (1910). However, due to printing constraints, publication deadlines, and various other reasons, I could not include the Master's various calligraphic styles and photographs. I only append the articles about the posthumous appointment and title conferment at the end. At the same time, I express my gratitude and apologies to Mr. Kim for providing valuable materials, and add a note expressing regret for not being able to provide full satisfaction to the readers. <76>

**Summary**

This 1920 article from the magazine *Kaebyŏk* gathers documents related to Kim Ok-kyun (posthumously Duke Ch'ungdal), a pivotal figure in Korea's late 19th-century reform movement. It includes a poem Kim wrote in exile, a long letter he sent to King Gojong defending his actions during the failed Gapsin Coup (1884), detailing his loyalty, criticizing court corruption (especially the Min clan and Chinese interference via Yuan Shikai), warning about foreign encroachment (British occupation of Geumun Island), and urging modernization. It also includes a letter Kim wrote to Qing official Li Hongzhang denying treasonous intent and questioning Qing policy. Finally, it provides official records from 1910 detailing Kim's posthumous rehabilitation, including his new titles, the posthumous name "Ch'ungdal," the imperial edict, the funeral oration text, and a newspaper report on the elaborate title conferment ceremony attended by Korean elites and Japanese officials.

From a historical perspective, the article is significant for presenting Kim Ok-kyun's own words (letters) defending his controversial reform attempt and offering a sharp critique of the Joseon court and international pressures just before annexation. The detailed account of his posthumous rehabilitation ceremony in 1910, orchestrated under Japanese influence just before formal annexation, highlights the complex political maneuvering of the era, using historical figures to legitimize changing power structures. Historians would find the juxtaposition of Kim's passionate pleas for sovereignty and reform with the details of his posthumous honors under imminent colonial rule particularly revealing.

忠達公實記의 거듬
						閔泳純


先生의 詩
先生이 日本에 亡命한지 越明年 丙戌 8月에 伊勢山으로부터 小笠原島에 還할 當時에 一詩를 賦하야 諸友人에게 示하야 曰
鬱鬱拘囚伊勢山、天公好與東風便、
不妨推縛出闠闤。千里笠原一日還。


先生의 文
이때 刺客 池運永의 事가 露顯함을 見하고 先生은 因하야 書를 李太王끠 呈하야 曰
臣 金玉均 誠惶誠恐 頓首百拜
主上殿下끠 白하노이다. 臣이 微哀을 述하야 聖聽을 煩코자한 지 已久하엿스나 天意가 震怒하사 장차 過激의 擧가 잇스리라함을 聞하고 時機가 업슴으로 今日에 至하얏나이다. 그런데 近頃에 池運永이란 者―突然히 日本 東京에 來하야 日本人 某某에게 約하야 曰 大朝鮮國 統理軍國事務主事 池運永이 大君主의 特命을 受하야 全權捕賊大使의 委任狀을 帶來하얏스니 萬若 我를 爲하야 逆賊 金玉均＜76＞을 誅斬하여 주면 그 成功 後 5日을 期하야 金5,000圓을 賞與할 것이오 萬一 其期가 過하되 賞을 與치아니할 時는 我의 帶來한 親筆 委任狀으로써 朝鮮政府에 訴하야 直時 그 金額을 請求함을 得하리라 하오니 臣이 此를 聞하고 驚愕함을 마지아니하야 百方으로 그 事情을 探索하야 大略 池運永의 擧動을 詳悉하온 바 玆에 敢히 封事를 奉하야 尊嚴을 冒코자 하노이다. 伏惟컨대 池運永輩로 하여금 海外에 來하야 猥濫히 君命을 稱하고 輕輕히 斯와 如한 條約을 爲케 하면 크게 殿下의 聲德을 傷치아니하오릿가. 池運永의 携帶한 委任狀은 果然 殿下의 親授한 者이오닛가. 臣이 此를 知치 못하거니와 其文에 曰
「命汝特差渡海捕賊使臨時計畫一任便宜爲國事務亦爲全權勿泛擧愆事」라 하고 年月日의 上에 大君主의 御璽를 鈐하얏나이다. 臣이 昨年 日本神戶에 在할 時에도 張甲福이란 者가 天威咫尺에서 斯와 如한 委任狀을 受하얏다 함을 聞하엿나이다. 이 張甲福, 池運永輩의 携帶한 委任狀은 그것이 私로 僞造한 者인지는 아지 못하오나 萬若 不幸히 참으로 殿下의 親授한 것이라 하면 臣이 外國에 流浪하는 身이라도 또한 殿下를 爲하야 一言의 諫爭이 업슬 수 업나이다. 아지 못하거니와 殿下는 張甲福, 池運永輩로써 如何한 者라 하야 親히 이와 가튼 重大한 委任狀을 與하얏나잇가. 萬若 이 委任狀이 外人의 耳目에 接觸하면 此事가 忽然히 萬國에 傳聞될 念慮도 업지 아니하오니 臣은 진실로 痛恨流涕함을 堪치 못하나이다. 이럼으로써 彼의 委任狀을 收取하야 此가 世上에 傳播되지 아니하도록 務圖하엿나이다. 伏惟殿下-身이 萬乘의 位를 踐하야 生民의 父母가 되사 廣히 天下萬國과 共히 交通의 條約을 訂하시지 아니하섯나잇가. 엇지 이와 가튼 輕擧를 하야 國體를 損하고 聲德을 汚함을 顧치 아니하나잇가. 今日의 天下는 古와 不同하야 各國이 互相 그 釁隙을 窺하야 他國의 內情을 察知하는 事-掌을 視함과 如한 자-有하오니 殿下- 幸히 聖意를 反省하는 바잇기를 臣이 切望하야 堪치 못하나이다. 臣이 또 別로히 私情을 陳述하야 殿下의 明斷에 訴코자 하나이다. 殿下끠서 臣에게 逆賊의 名을 加할진대 臣이 何罪로 由하야 然하오닛가. 窃惟컨대 이것은 全혀 殿下의 聖意에서 出함이 아니오 반듯이 奸臣輩가 自己의 嫌疑로 殘酷無狀의 行動을 逞코자 함이나 殿下는 聰明의 君主이시라 設使 奸類가 讒誣를 揑造하는 事 ㅣ 有할지라도 그 聖明을 壅蔽치 못할줄로 아는 故로 臣이 敢히 多言을 要치 아니하나이다. 다만 昨年의 事는 世間에서 혹은 넘우 急激에＜68＞ 近하다 議하는 者ㅣ 有하나 殿下는 試하야 즈욱이 省察하소서. 我邦의 閔族에 在하야 閔으로써 姓한 者는 其人의 賢不肖를 不問하고 此를 信重하야 股肱과 腹心을 삼은 지 20年의 久에 至하엿스나 閔族으로서 能히 殿下의 聖意를 奉答하야 生民에게 潤澤을 及할만한 政을 施하고 家國을 富强에 致할만한 謀를 建한 者ㅣ果然 幾人이 잇나잇가. 多分은 國을 賣하는 罪人으로 或은 淸國官吏의 力을 藉하야 우리 國權을 蔑如코자 하는 者도 잇스며 其他 許多의 罪는 一一히 枚擧키 難하온데 더욱히 奸臣이 坤殿의 寵을 恃하고 敢히 聖明을 壅蔽하야 國事를 破코자 하는 者도 또한 少치 아니하외다. 殿下-平生에 深히 此를 憂하사 竊히 臣에게 諭하사 此를 除할 計를 圖하시고 臣도 또한 感泣하야 奏上한 배 잇나이다. 臣이 以爲호대 今에 在하야 斯와 如한 奸類를 芟除치 못할 時는 千載의 下에 殿下로 하야곰 亡國의 君主됨을 免케 하기 不能함으로 곳 國家를 爲하야 身命을 擲하야 事를 擧하엿는데 今에 至하야 돌우여 臣을 負하야 逆賊이라 함은 何故이오닛가. 臣은 반듯이 殿下의 聖意가 안인줄을 知하나이다. 或은 臣等이 當時 外國의 力을 籍하얏다 評하는 者-有하나 이것은 當時 內外事情上 萬不得已에서 出한 者임은 殿下의 熟知하시는 바이올시다. 臣이 外國에 流離하야 苟且히 餘命을 保하는 것은 진실로 本意가 아니오나 그윽이 생각컨대 臣이 愚眛하야 曩者에 君上과 國家를 爲하야 素志를 貫徹치 못하엿스나 人臣의 分義는 盡하얏다하야 이에 姓名을 世上에 匿하야써 餘生을 過코자 함은 實로 臣의 志로소이다. 그러나 奸臣輩가 猥濫히 聖意를 迎하야 一家의 功利를 謀코자 하야 恣意로 誣言을 構造하기를 憚치 아니할 뿐 아니라 가장 甚한 者는 昨年 冬에 張甲福에게 瞞着이 되어 兒戱와 如한 說로써 三國을 攪亂하야 害를 生靈에 貽함에 至한 것은 臣이 殿下를 爲하야 悲함을 마지 아니하나이다. 伏願 殿下는 今後로부터 無用의 疑心을 除하고 奸臣輩의 讒言에 迷치 말으시고 깁히 國家의 大計를 愼하야 禍機를 未發에 防하야 祖宗 五百年의 基業으로 하야곰 基緖를 墮치 안케 하소서. 今에 天下의 形勢가 日로 變하고 月로 換하야 瞬時라도 安心키 不可하오니 全羅道 3島 卽 巨文島는 이미 英國의 奪한 배 되어 前車의 覆轍이 玆에 在하니 殿下는 썩 如何타 하나잇가. 在朝의 諸臣은 果然 何等의 計가 잇나잇가. 臣이 此를 知키 不能하오나 今日의 朝鮮國에서 英國의 名을 知하는 者는 果然 幾人이나 되나잇가. 設令 在朝의 諸臣이라도 英國이 何邊에 在하냐 問하면 茫然하야 答키 不能한 者- 往往 皆然하오니＜69＞ 此를 譬하면 或 物이 來하야 我의 肢體를 咬하여도 그 苦痛을 感치 못할뿐 아니라 何物이 我를 咬함인지도 不知함과 如한 바 그 國家의 存亡을 論함이 痴人의 夢을 說함과 如함은 足히 怪事ㅣ라 할것이 업나이다. 事勢가 이와 가튼데 殿下는 何等의 策이 有하야 亡國의 主됨을 免코자 하나잇가. 殿下의 腹心股肱된 者ㅣ 또 何等의 策이 有하야 殿下를 爲하야 國家의 安寧을 保하리잇가. 今日은 한갓 眠前 快樂에 偸安할 時가 안이오  淸國은 萬事를 朝鮮國家에 干涉하야 스스로 保護의 責에 任함과 如하나 巨文島를 回復하야 朝鮮을 爲하야 封域을 全키 不能한 즉 向後에 又 外國이 他港을 奪하는 事ㅣ 有하면 殿下는 如何코자 하오며 淸國은 何等의 方法으로써 此를 敎授코자 하나잇가. 臣이 聞한 바에 依하면 淸國은 일즉이 我國에 告하야 曰 英國은 屬邦領地가 甚多하야 別로 我國을 經營할 餘暇가 업슬뿐 아니라 장차 魯國과 交戰코자 하는 勢가 잇슴으로써 不得已 一時 巨文島를 領한 者인즉 少毫도 朝鮮國을 爲하야 可히 憂할 것이 안이라고 하얏나이다. 當時에 臣이 此言을 聞하고 心中에 그윽이 忿懣을 堪치 못하얏나이다. 이제 英國이 魯國과 交戰할 事ㅣ 有함을 恐하야 一港을 占領하면 魯國도 또한 英國과 交戰할 事ㅣ 有함을 恐하야 一港을 占領할 것은 火를 觀함보담 明하오이다. 僥倖으로 天下- 無事하야 英魯가 東洋에 相爭하는 事- 업다할지라도 殿下- 試하야 身을 英佛獨魯의 君이 되사 此를 思하소서. 萬若 玆에 一國이 잇는데 我가 此를 取하여도 毫末도 抵抗할 者- 없다 하면 殿下는 果然 此를 如何히 하고자 하리잇가. 今日 朝鮮이 即 是-라 그런데 在朝의 諸臣이 一策의 國家를 維持할 者- 업고 오즉 賣官賄賂를 是事하야 國民을 殘虐하고 人을 任호대 賢愚를 不問하고 誰는 大院君의 黨派라, 誰는 金玉均의 黨派라 하야 兒戱와 가튼 言으로써 取捨를 行함에 不過하니 이것이 엇지 國家의 長計이오닛가. 그런데 彼奸臣輩가 臣이 隣國 在에 함을 奇貨로 하야 誣詐를 逞하야 一家 私利를 計키 爲하야 無辜의 人을 殺하고 財를 奪한 事- 不少하옵고 더욱 甚한 것은 今回의 事로써 累를 殿下에게 及케 함에 至하오니 臣은 實로 言할 바를 知치 못하나이다. 殿下- 萬若 奸邪의 言을 聽하고 不明의 處置를 行코자하나잇가. 無智의 人民은 이때문에 疑念이 增長하야 終에 世間을 騷亂함에 至하오니 이것이 殿下의 深憂할 바로소이다. 且 日本政府라도 徒然히 兵을 外人에게 假하야 隣國을 騷動케 함과 如한 不正의 事는 잇지 아니하리이다. 臣은 已上에 縷述함과 如히 當初부터 生民을 爲하야 精神을＜70＞ 盡할 뿐이오. 敢히 亂暴의 擧動을 하야 生民을 茶毒한 事는 업나이다. 願컨대 殿下는 此를 國內에 公布하야써 人心의 鎭定을 謀하소서. 又 一說에 李鴻章이 日本政府와 約하야 刺客을 送하야 臣을 害코자 謀하는데 日本政府는 此를 傍觀할뿐 아니라 문득 그 刺客을 保護코자하는 狀이 有한 事는 그 證蹟이 이미 明瞭하다 云하는 者ㅣ 잇스되 臣은 此를 信치 아니하나이다. 何故오하면 設令 日本政府로 하여금 曩者에 朝鮮의 事에 干涉함을 悔하야 臣을 殺하야 그 口를 滅코자 하는 意가 잇다할지라도 堂堂한 一國의 政府로서 斯와 如한 兒戱의 條約을 할 理가 無하옵고 李鴻章도 또한 一國의 大臣으로 엇지 輕率히 人笑를 招할 事를 하오릿가. 大槪 袁世凱 等의 小兒가 다만 自己의 功利를 求하기에 急하야 猥濫히 殿下를 欺코자 함에서 發한 者이오니 殿下는 幸히 그 術中에 陷치 勿하소서. 생각컨대 淸國이 참으르 我邦을 爲하야 計코자 하면 能히 時勢에 通曉하야 저윽이 智能잇는 者를 選하야 我邦에 送하야 此를 誘導할 것이어늘 此를 不爲하고 袁世凱와 如한 口尙乳臭로 時勢를 辨치 못하는 者를 派遣하고 顧치 아니함은 臣은 그 뜻을 解치 못하나이다. 袁世凱는 本來 斗筲의 小人으로 다만 殿下와 坤殿의 歡心을 得하야 李鴻章에게 推薦하여주기를 望할뿐이니 彼의 一身을 爲하야 計하기도 不能커던 何暇에 殿下를 爲하야 計함을 得하오릿가. 臣이 愚昧할지라도 淸國의 大함으로 且 我와 脣齒의 關係가 잇삽는데 짐즛 此와 相踈함이 得策이 아닌줄은 知하오나 殿下의 奸臣은 袁世凱 等과 如한 無識의 徒와 結黨하야 國權을 蔑如하오니 이것을 臣이 坐視치 못하는 바이로소이다. 이제 朝鮮을 爲하야 謀하건대 淸國은 本來 足히 恃치 못할 것이오, 日本도 亦然하야 此二國은 各其 自家維持에 餘力이 無한 模樣이온데 何暇에 他國을 扶助함을 得하리잇가. 近年에 淸國의 安南琉球를 他國이 占領하여도 淸國이 敢히 一言의 抵抗을 試치 못하얏나이다. 그런데 我邦으로 하야금 高枕安臥를 得케하리라 云함은 實로 可笑할만한 事이오. 日本은 前年 來로 何等의 思考인지 一時熱心으로 我邦의 國事에 干涉하더니 一變의 後로는 忽然 此를 棄하야 顧치 아니할 模樣이오니 또한 足히 恃할수 업삽나이다. 果然 하온즉 장차 如何히 하여야 可하오릿가. 오즉 外로는 널리 歐美各國과 信義로써 親交하고 內로는 政略을 改革하야 愚昧의 人民을 敎호대 文明의 道로써 하고 商業을 興起하야 財政을 整理하고 또 兵을 養함도 難事가 아니오니 果然 能히 斯와 如히 하면 英國은 巨文島를 還附할 것이오, 其他 外國도 또한 侵略의＜71＞ 念을 絶함에 至하리리다. 今에 我邦의 人口가 20,000,000에 過하고 物産과 如한 것은 設令 人造의 精品은 無할지라도 天産의 物品에 至하야는 此를 日本 及 淸國의 北部에 比하야 遙히 優한 者 多하온데 就中 五金各鑛은 可히 勝數치 못하오니 斯와 如한 固有의 富한 財源을 擧하야 他國에 委賴코자함은 臣이 悲를 禁치 못하는 바로소이다. 臣이 多年의 見聞에 據하야 殿下끠 秦上한바 有하온데 殿下는 此를 記憶하시나잇가. 그 뜻은 今日 我邦 所謂 兩班을 芟除함에 잇나이다. 我邦 中古以前 國運이 隆盛할 時에는 一切의 器械物産이 東洋三國에 冠하엿는데 今에 總히 廢絶에 屬하야 다시 그 痕跡도 無함은 他故ㅣ 아니옵고 兩班의 跋扈專橫에 因하야 그러케 되엇나이다. 人民이 一物을 製하면 兩班官吏의 輩가 此를 橫奪하고 百姓이 辛苦하야 銖錙를 積하면 兩班官吏等이 來하야 此를 掠取하는 故로 人民은 말하되 自力으로 自作하야 衣食코자하는 時는 兩班官吏가 그 利를 吸收할 뿐만아니라 甚함에 至하야는 貴重한 生命을 失할 慮가 有하니 차라리 農商工의 諸業을 棄하야 危를 免함만 갓지 못하다 하야 이에 遊手의 民이 全國에 充滿하야 國力이 日로 消耗에 歸함에 至하엿나이다. 方今 世界가 商業을 主로 하야 서로 産業의 多를 競할 時에 當하야 兩班을 除하야 그 弊源을 芟盡할 事를 務치 아니하면 國家의 廢亡을 期待할 뿐이오니 殿下- 幸히 此를 猛省하사 速히 無識無能 守舊頑陋의 大臣輔國을 黜하야 門閥을 廢하고 人才를 選하야 中央集權의 基礎를 確定하야 人民의 信用을 收하고 널리 學校를 設하야 人智를 開發하고 外國의 宗敎를 誘入하야 敎化를 助함과 如함도 亦 一方便이라 하노이다. 大院君은 元來 天下의 形勢를 通치 못하야 是로써 曩에 一朝頑固의 擧動이 잇섯스나 今日은 此를 悔悟하는 狀이 有하야 人心의 繫할 바이온 즉 願컨대 一時 君에게 委호대 國家의 全權으로써 하야 萬一 君이 過失이 有하거던 殿下 主權을 揮하야 스스로 此를 匡正함이 可하오니 이것이 或은 今日의 危急을 救하는 一策일가 하노이다. 且 臣과 共히 難을 海外에 避하는 者 10餘 人이 皆 忠誠直實한 者이오니 殿下- 此를 本國에 召還하야 此를 採用하야 政事를 任하오면 他日 國家의 事를 할만함을 臣이 保하는 바로소이다. 朴泳孝, 徐光範, 徐載弼의 3人은 年方少壯하고 또 忠誠스럽고 困難을 經歷하야 能히 外國의 事情을 觀察한 者이오니 殿下ㅣ 速히 此를 召還하사 此를 信任하시면 곳 國家의 棟樑이 되리니 天下 各國이 誰가 殿下의 聖德을 贊揚치 아니하리릿가. 臣을 處함에 至하야는 오즉 無實의＜72＞ 罪名을 銷除하면 곳 天下의 公論에 從한 者라고 云하겟나이다. 臣은 天地에 誓하야 다시 榮寵을 慕하는 念이 無하오니 殿下ㅣ 진실로 此를 知得하시고 또 張甲福, 池運永輩와 如한 者는 此를 死刑에 處함을 不要하나이다. 彼輩가 비록 大罪가 업는 것은 아니오나 當初부터 機隙을 得치 못하게 하엿스면 엇지 能히 聖聰을 蠱惑하고 聖德을 累함에 至하엿스리잇가. 願컨대 殿下는 天父의 仁愛로 臣의 愚昧한 直言을 容納하여 주심을 千萬屛息하야 祈懇하기를 마지 아니하옵나이다.
