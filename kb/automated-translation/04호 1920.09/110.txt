**Body Text Translation:**
Tax on Beards

There have been cases in foreign countries where a tax on beards (髥) was imposed.

□ In England, during the era of Queen Elizabeth (에리사베쓰), a tax of three shillings and four pence (三志四片) (Japanese currency: one yen sixty-seven sen - 日貨一圓六七錢) was levied on those who did not shave their beards within two weeks.

□ In 1705, Peter the Great (彼得大帝) of Russia (露西亞) also established a beard tax system, collecting one hundred rubles (百留) from nobles (貴族) and one kopeck (一고바꾸) (Japanese currency: approximately one sen - 日貨 約 一錢) from commoners (普通人). Although this system suddenly provoked general antipathy (反感), it was nevertheless increasingly solidified by Azarin I (아자린 一世) in 1726, Peter II (彼得2世) in 1728, Empress Anna (皇后 안나) in 1731, and Empress Sari Ppŏssŭ (皇后 사리 뻐쓰) in 1734. Then, in 1762, during the time of Azarin II (아자린 二世), the beard tax was abolished (廢止).

□ In France (佛蘭西), around 1500, there was an instance where a beard tax was imposed on monks (僧侶). This was based on a proposal (發案) by the famous Archbishop Teyuburat (大僧正 데유부랏). After an edict (諭告) from the Pope (法王) was issued stating that those in the clergy (敎職) should preferably shave their chins, taxes were collected annually by the power of law (法律). Because of this, poor monks (貧乏한 僧徒) shaved off (剃落) their beards all at once (一齊히).<62>

**Summary**

The article details historical instances of beard taxes implemented in England under Queen Elizabeth, Russia under Peter the Great and his successors, and France targeting monks around 1500. It describes the specific tax amounts, the public reaction (notably negative in Russia), the system's duration and eventual abolition in Russia, and the consequence for poor monks in France who shaved due to the tax. From a Korean colonial history perspective, the article is interesting as it appears in *Kaebyŏk*, a significant Korean magazine of the era, reflecting Korean intellectuals' engagement with Western history and societal practices. It might implicitly comment on arbitrary regulations or taxation by showcasing foreign examples, potentially resonating with readers under Japanese colonial rule, though no direct comparison is made.
