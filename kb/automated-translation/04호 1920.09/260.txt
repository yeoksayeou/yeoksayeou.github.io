Ch'ŏnghŏ (淸虛)

The capitals of myriad nations are like anthills (蟻蛭),
The heroes of a thousand houses are like gnats in a vinegar jar (醯鷄).
Beneath the bright moon at one window, I rest my head on the pillow of clear emptiness,
The limitless pine wind's melodies are uneven.
(The above was written at Hyangno Peak, Myohyang Mountain, North P'yŏngan Province)

Again

The host dreams and speaks of the guest,
The guest dreams and speaks of the host.
Now, speaking of these two dreaming guests,
They too are people within a dream.
(The above was written at Kŭmgang Mountain)<108>

**Summary**

This article presents two short poems in Hanja by the renowned Joseon-era Buddhist monk Sŏsan Taesa (Ch'ŏnghŏ). The first poem, written at Myohyang Mountain, contrasts the fleeting nature of worldly power and fame (capitals like anthills, heroes like gnats) with the enduring reality of nature (moon, pine wind) and the peace found in detachment ("clear emptiness"). The second poem, written at Kŭmgang Mountain, uses the metaphor of dreaming hosts and guests to explore the illusory nature of perceived reality, suggesting that our waking lives may also be a form of dream. For historians, the publication of these poems by a revered historical Korean figure in *Kaebyŏk*, a prominent cultural and nationalist magazine during the Japanese colonial period (1920), is significant. It reflects a continued interest in and preservation of traditional Korean heritage and Buddhist thought, potentially serving as a subtle expression of national identity and cultural pride in a challenging era.
