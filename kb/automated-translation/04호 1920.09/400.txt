Article Title: 編輯餘談 (Editorial Afterthoughts)
Author: Not specified (likely the editorial staff)
Article Type: 사고·편집후기 (Announcement/Editorial Postscript)

At a time when the harsh heat has all passed, a cool breeze blows gently, and just as our spirits were about to become somewhat refreshed (酒落), an unexpectedly severe epidemic (病毒) threatens our lives (生命), making it a moment where anxious (悚懼) feelings do not cease even for an hour (時). It is the greatest joy that, fortunately, our readers (讀者諸位) and editorial colleagues (編輯同人) are safe and sound (無事健在).

The editing for the fourth issue is already finished, and we can finally catch our breath, but until we reach a point of satisfaction (滿足), we still cannot stretch our legs and sleep peacefully (平安). We ask our readers (讀者諸位) to kindly consider (斟酌) the diligent and competitive spirit (勉勉競競하는 心情) of the editorial staff (編輯同人).

Starting from the fifth issue, we have newly created a "Readers' Exchange Column" (讀者交情欄) so that all the hopes (希望), impressions (感想), and brilliant literary works (燦爛한 文藝) of our beloved readers (愛讀諸位) can be seen and enjoyed by one another. Please utilize this column and greatly vent your fiery spirit (氣燄).

In this fourth issue, there are many points we feel are insufficient amidst the general insufficiency. However, starting from the fifth issue, we intend to exert even more effort (努力) and, as our ability (能力) grows and as much as our strength allows, unfold before your eyes (諸君의 眼前에 展開코자) the product (結晶物) of our utmost sincerity and effort (盡心竭力). What might that be? Essays (論文) and academic articles (學術) go without saying (勿論), short stories (短篇小說) are art (藝術), long novels (長篇小說) are popular works (通俗), contemporary poems (時體) are modern (現代), sorrowful tales (哀話) are tears (其淚), "Solitary Barking from the Dark Hall" (玄堂獨吠) is script outlines (脚本槪要), "Scripts After Dark" (脚本隔夜) involves ideological conflicts (思想衝突), and miscellaneous fragments (餘外片談) are like gold dust and jade shavings (金粉玉屑)! Wait for it (待하오). Let us wait together (相待하오). With eyes wide open (括目하고).<153>

**Summary**

This editorial postscript from *Gaebyeok* magazine's fourth issue (September 1920) expresses the editors' relief at completing the issue amidst anxieties caused by a severe epidemic. They apologize for any shortcomings and announce a new "Readers' Exchange Column" for issue five to foster community interaction. The editors promise enhanced content in future issues, listing various genres they plan to include, from academic articles and fiction to poetry, critical commentary ("Solitary Barking from the Dark Hall"), pieces on ideological conflict ("Scripts After Dark"), and miscellaneous literary gems ("Gold Dust and Jade Shavings"), urging readers to anticipate these improvements eagerly.

From a historical perspective, the article is revealing for its direct mention of the public health crisis ("모진 病毒," likely cholera) impacting society and the editors' work, reflecting the precariousness of life in 1920s Korea. The editors' mix of anxiety, apology for perceived insufficiencies, and ambitious plans for diverse, intellectually stimulating content (including potentially critical or ideologically charged pieces hinted at by terms like "思想衝突") highlights the challenging yet vibrant atmosphere for nationalist intellectuals attempting to foster Korean culture and discourse under Japanese colonial rule. The introduction of a readers' column also signifies an early effort towards building a participatory public sphere through the magazine.
