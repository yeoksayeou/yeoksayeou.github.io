上海
廣東砲響動江南
敵勢崩騰戰未酣
逐許外商通上海
金陵一約不勝慙

Shanghai
The roar of Guangdong cannons shakes Jiangnan,
The enemy's force collapses and surges, the battle not yet at its height.
Compelled to permit foreign merchants passage through Shanghai;
The single treaty of Jinling brings unbearable shame.

南京
金陵三月客東來
催馬斜陽上北臺
江水悠悠山勢遠
雄城昔日帝都開

Nanjing
In the third month in Jinling, a traveler comes from the east,
Urging his horse in the setting sun, he ascends the northern terrace.
The river flows long and slow, the mountain ranges are distant;
This mighty city, in former days, opened as the imperial capital.

其二
獅子山前雲寂寂
鳳凰臺下草依依
六朝官闕餘春夢
落日空城百鳥歸

Part 2
Before Lion Mountain, the clouds are silent and still,
Below Phoenix Terrace, the grass grows lush and green.
Of the Six Dynasties' palaces, only spring dreams remain;
In the setting sun, over the empty city, a hundred birds return.

明宮古址
五龍橋外五門通
指點當年建帝宮
滿地菜花成老圃
血碑無語立春風

Site of the Ming Palace Ruins
Beyond the Five Dragon Bridge, the Five Gates connect,
Pointing out where the imperial palace was built in those years.
The ground, full of rapeseed flowers, has become an old garden;
A blood stele stands wordless in the spring wind.

登鷄鳴山
南朝多寺已成塵
唯有鷄鳴古蹟眞
歷代金陵風雨變
老僧白髮幾經春

Climbing Jiming Mountain
The many temples of the Southern Dynasties have already turned to dust,
Only Jiming remains, a true historical site.
Through successive dynasties, Jinling's winds and rains have changed;
The old monk with white hair—how many springs has he passed?

洞庭湖
蜀山春水洞庭生
天色湖光玉鏡淸
試看船頭今夜月
巴陵美酒最多情＜96＞

Dongting Lake
From the Shu Mountains, spring waters flow into Dongting,
The sky's color and the lake's gleam form a clear jade mirror.
Try looking from the boat's bow at tonight's moon;
Baling's fine wine is full of deep feeling. <96>

**Summary**

This collection of Hanja poems by Pak Kil-sŏ describes travels through prominent historical and modern locations in China: Shanghai, Nanjing (including specific sites like the Ming Palace ruins and Jiming Mountain), and Dongting Lake. The poems contrast China's glorious imperial past (Nanjing as a capital, the Ming Palace) with scenes of decay, the passage of time (ruins, old monks), and the impact of modern events (foreign presence in Shanghai following the Opium War, referenced by the "Treaty of Jinling"). A sense of melancholy reflection on history and lost grandeur pervades most of the poems, except for the slightly more scenic and romantic depiction of Dongting Lake. From the perspective of Korean colonial history, these poems, published in the nationalist magazine *Kaebyŏk* in 1920, are interesting. The reflections on a neighboring country's historical changes, lost sovereignty (implied in the descriptions of ruins and the shameful treaty regarding Shanghai), and the enduring landscape might have served as a veiled commentary or point of resonance for Korean readers grappling with their own recent loss of independence and the presence of foreign power. Historians might find the choice of themes—foreign intrusion, remnants of past glory, the passage of time marked on historical sites—significant in understanding the intellectual and emotional landscape of Koreans during the early colonial period.
