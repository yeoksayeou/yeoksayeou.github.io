Editorial Notice

Our Kaebyŏk (開闢), possessing the vast majority of readers, is profoundly grateful as cosmic acclaim reaches its zenith with each passing month and progressing issue. Simultaneously, the editorial staff feels the weight of responsibility acutely, causing sweat to soak our backs. Therefore, our editorial department, never forgetting improvement and ceaselessly pursuing progress, has decided to delay the publication date, which was the 25th of each month, by 5 days, henceforth issuing on the 1st of each month. Accordingly, issue number 5, which would have been released on October 25th, will be published on November 1st. Subsequently, each issue will provide a new volume (新本) to our esteemed readers, who possess a new spirit (新精神), on the new day of the new month (新月 新日).<153>

**Summary**

This editorial notice from the magazine *Kaebyŏk* announces a change in its publication schedule. Citing overwhelming reader support and a corresponding sense of responsibility, the editors are moving the release date from the 25th of the month to the 1st of the following month, starting with the November 1st issue. This change is framed as a way to deliver a "new" issue reflecting a "new spirit" at the beginning of each new month. From a historical perspective, the notice highlights the existence and perceived popularity of a Korean-language cultural magazine in 1920, early in the colonial period. The editors' expressed sense of duty and the emphasis on "newness" and "progress" might subtly reflect the nationalist or modernizing aspirations prevalent among Korean intellectuals at the time, navigating the constraints of Japanese colonial rule.
