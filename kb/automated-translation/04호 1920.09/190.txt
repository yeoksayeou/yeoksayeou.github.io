**Body Text Translation:**
When there is nothing to do, diligently examine whether strange thoughts arise or not. When there is something to do, wholeheartedly search whether coarse intentions might be present. When achieving one's aims, look carefully whether a boastful appearance manifests unconsciously, and when free from worries, examine whether a harsh mind, resentful and hating anyone, might have become entangled. Keep these things deeply engraved in the mind from time to time, seeking the small from the large, and reaching the state of non-existence from existence; only then does this barely become the basis for learning.
Only by casting off this sticky self can all things disappear, and consequently, the mind always becomes bright. When it becomes bright, the basis for learning naturally comes and intertwines. Only by knowing this life as true can all things be equipped, and the mind always becomes full. When it is full, one cannot be reached by any temptations. <95>

**Summary**

This short philosophical piece advises constant self-examination and mindfulness. The author urges readers to scrutinize their thoughts and intentions in times of both action and inaction, guarding against arrogance and resentment. True learning, it suggests, comes from achieving a state of inner emptiness by shedding the ego ("sticky self"), which paradoxically leads to mental clarity and fullness. This inner state allows one to perceive life truly and remain unaffected by external temptations. From a historical perspective, this article, published in *Kaebyŏk* magazine in 1920, reflects an emphasis on inner cultivation and moral discipline during the early, repressive phase of Japanese colonial rule. Historians might find it interesting as an example of how some Koreans focused on self-strengthening and spiritual resilience, possibly drawing on traditional philosophies, amidst external political and social constraints. The use of early modern Korean script and orthography is also of linguistic interest.

기사형태	잡저

일이 업슬 때에는 반듯이 야릇한 생각이 잇슬가 업슬가 함을 힘써 삷히며. 일이 잇슬 때에는 문득 거친 뜻이나 업나함을 맘껏 차지며. 뜻을 어들 때에는 가장 젠체하는 빗이 저절로 나타나지나 아니하나 함과, 실음 업슬 때엔 아모에게나 원망하고 미워하는 모진 마음이 엉키지나 아니하얏나 함을 두루 보삷혀 가끔가끔 이것을 마음에 꼭 멱어서 만흠으로부터 적음을 찻고 잇슴으로부터 업는 대까지 이르러야 이것이 겨우 배홈의 조흔거리니라.
찝덕이의 내 몸을 붓어버려야 곳 온가지가 다 업서지고 조차 그 마음이 늘우 환하야지나니 환하야진 즉 조흔거리가 저절로 와 엉키이고. 살음의 나를 참인줄 알아야 온갓 것이 다 가추어 그 마음이 늘우 그뜩하나니 그뜩한 즉 모든 끌림에 다닥치지 못하나니라.＜95＞
