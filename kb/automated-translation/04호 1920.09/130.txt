Heaven

English people say that if you give property to the destitute (貧塞), you will go to Heaven, but nobody practices this. However, African natives say that if you kill many people, you will go to Heaven, and so they kill people as casually as eating cold rice for lunch. (Shaw-)＜66＞

**Summary**

The article contrasts two beliefs about attaining Heaven: the English belief that giving wealth to the poor is the way, though unpracticed, and the belief attributed to African natives that killing many people is the way, which is supposedly practiced frequently and casually. This short piece, attributed to "Shaw" (likely G.B. Shaw), uses a stark comparison. For historians, the text reflects common Western, possibly colonial-era, stereotypes about "primitive" African cultures contrasted with the perceived hypocrisy of "civilized" Christian societies. Its appearance in a Korean magazine like *Kaebyŏk* could indicate the circulation of such ideas or critiques within colonial Korea.
