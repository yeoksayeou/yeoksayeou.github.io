The True Form of Korean Tonghak Thought
						By One Reporter

In our previous issue, as part of the "Introduction to Ten Great Figures," we introduced Ch'oe Suun Sŏnsaengnim, the founder of Tonghak. Now, to show his thought more concretely, we transcribe a few passages from the scriptures written in his own hand. However, to speak truthfully about this, his writings, being aimed at the populace of the time, frequently employ metaphorical language, making it difficult to grasp their true form without reading the entire work. Here, we can only show its outline.

Nonhangmun (Discourse on Learning)
(Original text preamble omitted) In the year Kyŏngsin [1860], the month of Kŏnsa [fourth lunar month], the world was in turmoil, and the people's hearts were fickle and thin, not knowing where to turn. Furthermore, strange and deviant doctrines surged through the world. The people of the West achieved the Way and established virtue, and through their ingenuity (造化), there was nothing they could not accomplish. In attacking and fighting with weapons, none could stand before them. China is being destroyed; how can there not be the lament of 'when the lips are gone, the teeth are cold'? This is all because these people call their Way the Western Way (西道), their learning Catholicism (天主), and their teaching the Holy Teaching (聖敎). Is this not knowing the time of Heaven and receiving the Mandate of Heaven (天命)? Because these things continued one after another, I too was fearful. I only lamented being born late. My body often shivered with cold; outwardly, there was the energy of spiritual communion (接靈之氣), and inwardly, there were teachings from divine words descending (降話之敎). Looking, it could not be seen; listening, it could not be heard. My mind was still suspicious and astonished. Maintaining my heart and rectifying my energy (守心正氣), I asked, "Why is it like this?" [A voice] said, "My heart is precisely your heart (吾心卽汝心也). How can people know this? They know Heaven and Earth but do not know the spirits (鬼神). The spirits are I. Attain the Way which is boundless for you, cultivate and refine it (修而煉之), create writings from it to teach people (制其文敎人), establish its laws and spread virtue (正其法布德則), and then I shall make you live long and be renowned throughout the world." I also reached the age of one [year since the revelation?], cultivated and considered it, and indeed there seemed to be a natural principle to it. Therefore, I composed a mantra (呪文), a method for spirit descent (降靈之法), and verses for not forgetting (不忘之詞). The Way's method in sequence became just twenty-one characters (至氣今至願爲大降 侍天主造化定永世不忘萬事知) [The ultimate energy is now arriving; I wish for its great descent. Bearing the Lord of Heaven, creation is determined; eternally not forgetting, one knows all things].
Turning to the year Sinyu [1861], worthy scholars from all directions came to me and asked, "Sir, now that the Heavenly spirit has descended upon you, why is it so?" I replied, "I received the principle of 'no going forth without returning'." They asked, "Then by what Way is it named?" I said, "The Heavenly Way (天道)." They asked, "Is it not different from the Western Way (洋道)?" I said, "Western Learning (洋學), <53> it is thus, yet different. It is like a spell (呪) but without substance. However, the destiny (運) is one, the Way (道) is the same, but the principle (理) is not." They asked, "Why is it so?" I said, "My Way is transformation without action (無爲而化). Protect the heart, rectify the energy, follow nature (率其性), receive the teaching, and transformation emerges from within the natural course (化出於自然之中也)." (Original text middle section omitted) They said, "Speaking of the same Way, shouldn't it be called Western Learning?" I said, "Not so. I was born in the East and learned in the East (吾生於東學於東). Though the Way is the Heavenly Way, the learning is Eastern Learning (東學). Moreover, the land is divided into East and West. How can the West be called East, and the East be called West?" (Original text middle section omitted)
They asked, "What is the meaning of the mantra (至氣今至願爲大降, 侍天主造化定, 永世不忘萬事知)?" I said, "至 (Chi) signifies the Lord of Heaven (天主), so speaking of the mantra, there are current characters and ancient characters. They asked, "What about the text for spirit descent (降靈之文)?" I said, "至 (Chi) means reaching the extreme. 氣 (Ki) is the void, spiritual, vast expanse, involved in everything, commanding everything, yet form-like but difficult to describe, sound-like but difficult to perceive; it is also the single energy of primordial chaos (渾元之一氣). 今至 (Kŭmji) means entering the Way here and now, knowing that energy and connecting with it. 願爲 (Wŏnwi) is the meaning of request and prayer. 大降 (Tae'gang) is the wish for the transformation of energy (氣化之願). 侍 (Si) means internally there is divine spirit (神靈), externally there is transformation by energy (氣化); it means that all people of the world each know that which does not change. 主 (Chu) means referring to the revered one and serving like one serves parents. 造化 (Chohwa) means transforming without action (無爲而化). 定 (Chŏng) means unifying one's virtue and settling one's mind. 永世 (Yŏngse) means a person's lifetime. 不忘 (Pulmang) means the intention of preserving the thought. 萬事 (Mansa) means a great number of things. 知 (Chi) means knowing the Way and receiving that knowledge. Therefore, if one brightens their virtue (明明其德) and constantly remembers without forgetting (念念不忘), they will reach the ultimate transformation (至化), the ultimate energy (至氣), and attain ultimate sagehood (至於至聖)."

Sudŏngmun (Discourse on Cultivating Virtue)
(Original text preamble omitted) I hail from the East, passing my days uneventfully, barely maintaining the family reputation, unavoidably a poor scholar (寒士). My ancestors' loyalty and righteousness overflowed at Yongsan (龍山), and our King's flourishing virtue returned in the years Imjin and Pyŏngja [referring to the Imjin War and Pyŏngja Invasion recoveries]. Thus, the lingering grace flowed unbroken. My father appeared in the world, his name known throughout the province, recognized by all in the scholar-gentry (士林). His virtue inherited in this generation, is it not the remaining fortune for his descendants? Alas, the scholar's life is a spring dream in the passage of time. Reaching the age of forty, my work knew only the things beside the brushwood fence; my heart lacked the great Way reaching for blue clouds. Composing verses of 'returning home' [like Tao Yuanming], reciting phrases of 'awakening to past wrongs' [like Tao Yuanming], leaning on my staff and arranging my clogs, I wandered like a retired scholar. Mountains are high and waters long; everyone knows the style of Chinsŏnsaeng [Master Chi? Possibly referring to Chu Hsi's influences]. The strange peaks and grotesque rocks of Kumi (龜尾), north of Wŏlsŏng Kŭmo (月城金鰲); the clear pools of Yongch'u (龍湫) and Pokye (寶溪), west of the old capital Malong (馬龍). Peach blossoms in the garden might know the fisherman's boat [allusion to Peach Blossom Spring]; the blue waves before the house hold the intent of T'aegong's fishing [Jiang Ziya]. The pond behind the railings does not betray the aspiration of Lien-hsi [Zhou Dunyi]. The pavilion named Yongdam (龍潭), is it not yearning for the heart of Ko [Zhuge Liang]? Unable to stop the flow of time like water, mourning the day [my father] became an immortal [passed away]. Left alone, reaching the age of twenty-eight [Korean age, i.e., 27], how could I know anything? No different from a child. My late father's lifelong work left no trace amid the flames [likely house fire or destruction]; the lingering regret of an unworthy descendant falls upon the world. Is it not painful? Is it not lamentable? (Original text middle section omitted) Since then, casting off the world's turmoil, removing the knots of friendship from my breast. The old house at Yongdam was my father's lecture seat; the new government office in the Eastern Capital [Kyŏngju] is my hometown. The day I returned with my wife and children to dwell there was the tenth month of Kimi [1859]. Riding the current of destiny (運), I received the Way in the fourth month of Kyŏngsin [1860]. This too is like a dream, difficult to describe in words. Cultivating and refining it, it is all natural. Awakening to the Master's [Confucius'?] Way, it is determined by a single principle. Discussing my own Way, it is largely the same but slightly different. Removing doubts, the principles of things become self-evident. Examining past and present, it is the doings of human affairs. (Original text remainder omitted)

Ipch'unsi (Poem on the Beginning of Spring)
The energy of the Way lasts long, evil cannot enter.
People of the world do not return the same way. <54>

Chŏlgu (Quatrain)
Who can know when the river clears and the phoenix sings?
From where this destiny comes, I do not know.
My whole life receiving the mandate of a thousand-year destiny,
The Sage's virtue inherited by the family for a hundred generations.
Yongdam's waters flow, the source for the four seas;
Mount Kwi's spring returns, the flower for a generation.

Chwajam (Sitting Admonition)
My Way is broad yet concise; no need for many words' meaning.
There is no other principle: Sincerity, Reverence, Faith (誠敬信) – these three characters.
Make your effort here; only after penetration can you know.
Fear not the dust of thoughts arising, only fear awakening too late.

Hwagyŏl (Harmony Formula)
Every place, every valley, walking to the end. Every water, every mountain, knowing each one.
Pine trees, cypress trees, standing green and lush. Every branch, every leaf, ten thousand, thousand joints.
The old crane bears a child, spreading across the world. Flying here, flying there, utmost yearning and respect.
Destiny, O destiny, attained or not? Time, O time, the awakened one!
Phoenix, O phoenix, the worthy one! River, O river [Yellow River], the sage!
Peach and plum blossoms in the spring palace, vibrant and lovely! Aspiring men, heroes, joyful and glad!
Myriad valleys, thousand peaks, high, high! One climb, two climbs, humming softly.
Bright, bright is the destiny, each one bright. Fellow students taste [the Way], thought after thought the same.
A thousand blossoms on a ten-thousand-year branch; one moon in the clouds over the four seas reflected in the mirror.
People ascending the tower are like immortals on cranes' backs; horses floating on boats are like dragons in heaven.
Though people lack Confucius, their intent is the same; though books are not ten thousand volumes, their will can be great.

T'andoyusim'gŭp (Lamenting the Impatient Mind Regarding the Way of Confucianism)
The great destiny of mountains and rivers all returns to this Way. Its source is extremely deep, its principle exceedingly far.
Solidify the pillar of my heart, then I will know the taste of the Way. With one thought here, all things are as wished.
Eliminate turbid energy, nourish pure energy like raising a child. It's not just about the heart arriving, but solely about rectifying the heart.
Dimly yet totally bright, transformation emerges naturally. All affairs to come return to the single principle.
Do not discuss others' minor faults in my heart. My heart's small kindnesses, bestow them upon others.
Such a great Way, do not be sincere only in small matters. Facing merit, exhaust all consideration; naturally, there will be help.
Wind and cloud [potential], great capacity, according to the vessel's measure. Do not reveal the profound mechanism; do not be impatient in heart.
When merit is achieved on another day, make a good connection with immortality.
The heart is fundamentally empty, responding to things without description.
Cultivating the heart leads to knowing virtue; virtue, only when bright, is the Way.
It lies in virtue, not in people; in faith, not in effort; in the near, not in the far.
In sincerity, not in seeking. It seems not so, yet it is so; it seems far, yet it is not far.

Former Eight Stanzas (Latter Eight Stanzas omitted - original note)

It lies not where brightness is; far off, do not seek, but cultivate myself.
Not knowing where virtue lies; consider the transformation of my own body.
Not knowing where brightness lies; look back at the brightness of my own heart.
Not knowing where the Way lies; gauge the constancy of my own faith.
Not knowing what sincerity achieves; count the steadfastness of my own heart.
Not knowing what reverence does; momentarily do not slacken in yearning respect.
Not knowing what awe does; contemplate the impartiality of utmost public-mindedness.
Not knowing the heart's gain and loss; examine the public or private nature of its use.
=The above is from the "Tonggyŏng Taejŏn" (東經大全)=

Yongdam Sa (Song of Yongdam)
Reporter's Note: Sŏnsaengnim, 60 years ago from now, composed writings early on to explain his profound teachings. The several pieces excerpted here are precisely those.

Heaven's grace is boundless; on the 5th day of the 4th month of Kyŏngsin [1860], how can it be recorded in writing, <55> how can it be expressed in words? The Peerless Great Way (無極大道), unknown in myriad ages, attained as if in a dream, as if awake. How marvelous! How marvelous! This destiny of mine is marvelous. The words Hanunim spoke: "50,000 years after Creation (開闢), you are also the first. I too, since Creation, labored without achievement, but meeting you, I succeed. I succeed, and you achieve your aim. Your household has great destiny." After hearing these words, my heart is uniquely joyful and proud. Ah, people of the world! How can you know that the destiny of the Infinite (無極之運) has arrived? How marvelous! How marvelous! This destiny of mine is marvelous. The fine scenic spot of Kumi Mountain's waters (龜尾山水), where I cultivate the Peerless Great Way; it is the destiny of 50,000 years. (Original text remainder omitted)

Todŏk Sa (Song of Morality)
Ignorant people of the world, even if they know Heaven and Earth, lack a heart of reverence (敬畏之心), so what do they know? They speak as if seeing the Lord on High (上帝) residing in the Jade Capital Terrace (玉京臺) in Heaven. Setting aside the principles of Yin and Yang (陰陽理致), isn't this just empty talk (虛無之說)? The witchcraft affairs (巫蠱事) of the Han dynasty spread to our East (我東方), and what every household practices, under various names, are ghosts and spirits (鬼神).
Observe this kind of perception. Heaven and Earth are also spirits; spirits are also Yin and Yang. Not knowing this, what is the use of studying the classics (經傳)? Not knowing the Way and Virtue (道와 德), how can one know worthy men and gentlemen (賢人君子)? The words of the utterly ignorant and confused are that "Nowadays it's Old Heaven (老天), there's no spiritual efficacy (靈驗), wicked people gain wealth and rank, while virtuous people suffer poverty." This is all they say. How does one cultivate oneself? They look at lineage (地閥) and family influence (家勢), follow trends, and say, "So-and-so has good lineage, and his writing skills are abundant, so he is clearly a gentleman of morality (道德君子)." Shamelessly praising him! Ridiculous! What lineage does that person have to be compared to a gentleman? What writing skills does he have to discuss morality? I too, in this world, am merely a commoner scholar in plain clothes (布衣寒士), but how could I not know Heavenly Principle (天理)? The movements of a person's hands and feet, this is also spirits (鬼神). The workings of the mind between good and evil, this is also energy/destiny (氣運). Speaking and laughing, this is also creation/transformation (造化). (Original text middle section omitted)

**Summary**

This article from the March 1922 issue of *Kaebyŏk* magazine introduces the core tenets of Tonghak thought by presenting excerpts from the writings of its founder, Ch'oe Suun (崔水雲). The reporter prefaces the excerpts by noting the allegorical nature of Ch'oe's writings, aimed at the common people. Key texts like *Nonhangmun*, *Sudŏngmun*, *Yongdam Sa*, and *Todŏk Sa* are sampled from the *Tonggyŏng Taejŏn* and *Ch'ŏndogyo Sŏ*. The selections emphasize Ch'oe's divine revelation experience, the concept of "My heart is your heart" (吾心卽汝心), the 21-character mantra embodying key principles like *Sich'ŏnju* (Bearing the Lord of Heaven), the distinction between Tonghak (Eastern Learning) and Sŏhak (Western Learning/Catholicism) despite sharing the same 'destiny' (運), and the importance of inner cultivation through sincerity, reverence, and faith (誠敬信). The excerpts also touch upon Ch'oe's personal background and critique contemporary societal ignorance regarding the true nature of spirits, morality, and Heavenly Principle. For colonial Korean history, this article is significant as it represents an effort by intellectuals associated with the Ch'ŏndogyo movement (Tonghak's successor) to articulate and disseminate the foundational doctrines of a native Korean religious and philosophical system during a period of intense cultural suppression under Japanese rule. Publishing these core texts, including the emphasis on Korean identity ("Born in the East, Learned in the East") and unique destiny, was a subtle act of cultural resistance and assertion of national consciousness. Historians might find the specific framing and selection of texts revealing about how Ch'ŏndogyo leaders in the early 1920s sought to present Tonghak's origins and message to a contemporary audience.

朝鮮東學思想의 正軆
						一記者
우리는 前號에 잇서 10代 偉人 紹介의 一로 東學 元祖 崔水雲先生을 紹介하엿습니다. 이제 그의 思想如何를 더 좀 具軆的으로 보이기 爲하야 그의 親筆에 成한 經典의 몃 句節을 謄載합니다. 그런데 이에 對하야 事實대로 말하면 그의 글은 當時의 民衆을 相對로 한 關係上 그 語句에 만히 隱喩의 方式을 取하야 全篇을 通閱하지 아니하면 그 正軆를 捉得하기 어렵습니다. 여긔에는 다 못 그 輪廓을 보임 뿐이외다.

論學文
(冠略-원문) 夫庚申之年, 建巳之月, 天下紛亂, 民心淆薄, 莫知所向之地. 又有怪違之說, 崩騰于世間, 西洋之人, 道成德立, 及其造化, 無事不成, 攻鬪干戈, 無人在前, 中國消滅, 豈可無唇亡之嘆耶. 都緣無他斯人, 道稱西道, 學稱天主, 敎則聖敎, 此非知天時而受天命耶. 擧此一一不已故, 吾亦悚然, 只有恨生晩之際, 身多戰寒, 外有接靈之氣, 內有降話之敎, 視之不見, 聽之不聞, 心尙怪訝, 守心正氣而問曰, 何爲若然也, 曰吾心卽汝心也, 人何知之, 知天地而無知鬼神, 鬼神者吾也. 及汝無窮無窮之道, 修而煉之, 制其文敎人, 正其法布德則, 令汝長生, 昭然于天下矣 吾亦幾至一歲, 修而度之則, 亦不無自然之理. 故一以作呪文, 一以作降靈之法, 一以作不忘之詞, 次第道法, 猶爲二十一字 (至氣今至願爲大降 侍天主造化定永世不忘萬事知) 而已.
轉至辛酉, 四方賢士, 進我而問曰, 今天靈降臨先生, 何爲其然也, 曰受其無往不復之理. 曰然則何道以名之乎, 曰天道也, 曰與洋道無異者乎, 曰洋學,＜53＞ 如斯而有異, 如呪而無實, 然而運則一也, 道則同也, 理則非也. 曰何爲其然也, 曰吾道無爲而化矣, 守其心正其氣, 率其性受其敎, 化出於自然之中也. (中略-원문) 曰同道言之則名其西學也, 曰不然, 吾生於東學於東道雖天道, 學則東學, 況地分東西, 西何謂東, 東何謂西(中略-원문)
曰呪文 (至氣今至願爲大降, 侍天主造化定, 永世不忘萬事知) 之意何也, 曰至爲天主之字故, 以呪言之, 今文有古文有. 曰降靈之文何也, 曰至者極焉之爲至, 氣者虛靈蒼蒼無事不涉, 無事不命, 然而如形而難狀, 如聞而難見, 是亦渾元之一氣也. 今至者, 於斯入道, 知其氣接者也. 願爲者請祝之意也. 大降者, 氣化之願也. 侍者, 內有神靈, 外有氣化, 一世之人, 各知其不移者也. 主者, 稱其尊而與父母同事者也. 造化者, 無爲而化也. 定者, 合其德定其心也. 永世者, 人之平生也. 不忘者, 存想之意也. 萬事者數之多也. 知者, 知其道而受其知也. 故, 明明其德念念不忘則, 至化至氣, 至於至聖.

修德文
(先略-원문)余出自東方, 無事度日, 僅保家聲, 未免寒士. 先祖之忠義節有餘於龍山, 吾王之盛德歲復回於壬丙, 若是餘蔭不絶如流, 家君出世, 名盖一道無不士林之共知, 德承方世豈非子孫之餘慶. 噫, 學士之平生, 光陰之春夢, 年至四十, 工知笆籬之邊物, 心無靑雲之大道, 一以作歸去來之辭, 一以詠覺非是之句携筇理屐, 怳若處士之行, 山高水長, 莫非知先生之風龜尾之奇峰怪石月城金鰲之北, 龍湫之淸潭寶溪, 古都馬龍之西, 園中桃花恐知魚子之舟, 屋前滄波意在太公之釣, 檻後池塘無違㾾溪之志, 亭號龍潭豈非慕葛之心. 難禁歲月之如流, 哀臨一日之化仙, 孤我一命, 年至二八何以知之, 無異童子. 先考平生之事業無痕於火中, 子孫不肖之餘恨, 落心於世間, 豈不痛哉, 豈不惜哉.(中略-원문) 自是由來, 擺脫世間之紛撓責去胸海之朋結, 龍潭古舍, 家嚴之丈席, 東都新府惟我之故鄕, 率妻子還棲之日己未之十月, 乘其運道受之節庚申之四月, 是亦夢寐之事難狀之言. 修而煉之莫非自然, 覺來夫子之道則一理之所定也, 論其唯我之道則大同而小異也, 去其疑訝則事理之當然, 察其古今則人事之所爲.

立春詩
道氣長存邪不入 世間衆人不同歸＜54＞

絶句
河淸鳳鳴孰能知 運自何方吾不知 平生受命千年運
聖德家承百世業 龍潭水流四海源 龜岳春回一世花

座箴
吾道博而約 不用多言義 別無他道理 誠敬信三字
這裏做工夫 透後方可知 不怕塵念起 唯恐覺來遲

和訣
方方谷谷行行盡 水水山山箇箇知 松松栢栢靑靑立 技技葉葉萬萬節 老鶴生子布天下 飛來飛去慕仰極 運兮運兮得否 時云時云覺者 鳳兮鳳兮賢者 河兮河兮聖人 春宮桃李夭夭兮 志士男兒樂樂哉 萬壑千峰高高兮 一登二登小小吟 明明其運各各明 同同學味念念同 萬年枝上花千朶 四海雲中月一鑑 登樓人如鶴背仙 泛舟馬若天上龍 人無孔子意與同 書非萬卷志能大.

嘆道儒心急
山河大運, 盡歸此道, 其源極深, 其理甚遠. 固我心柱, 乃知道味. 一念在玆, 萬事如意. 消除濁氣, 兒養淑氣. 非徒心至, 惟在正心. 隱隱總明, 化出自然 來頭百事, 同歸一理. 他人細過, 勿論我心. 我心小惠, 以施於人. 如斯大道, 勿誠小事, 臨勳盡料, 自然有助. 風雲大手, 隨其器局. 玄機不露, 勿爲心急, 功成他日, 好作仙緣. 心兮本虛, 應物無述. 心修來而知德, 德唯明而是道. 在德不在人, 在信不在工, 在近不在遠. 在誠不在求, 不然而其然, 似遠而非遠.

前八節  (後八節은 略함-원문)

不在明之所在, 遠不求而修我. 不知德之所在, 料吾身之化生. 不知明之所在, 顧吾心之明明. 不知道之所在, 度吾信之一如. 不知誠之所致, 數吾心之不失 不知敬之所爲, 暫不弛於慕仰. 不知畏之所爲, 念至公之無私. 不知心之得失, 察用處之公私

龍潭詞
記者曰 先生은 距今 60年前에 잇서 일즉히 말글을 지어 그 뜻깁흔 敎意를 說明하얏스니 여긔에 抄出하는 數篇이 곳 그것이외다.

天恩이 罔極하야 庚申4月初5日에 글로 엇지 記錄하며＜55＞ 말로 엇지 成言할가. 萬古업는 無極大道 如夢如覺得道로다. 奇壯하다. 奇壯하다. 이내 運數奇壯하다. 한우님하신 말삼 「開闢後 5萬年에 네가 또한 처음이라. 나오 또한 開闢以後 勞而無功하다가서 너를 만나 成功하니 나도 成功 너도 得意 너의 집안 큰 運數라」이 말슴 드른 後에 心獨喜自負로다. 어와 世上사람들아 無極之運 닥춘줄을 너의 엇지 알가보냐. 奇壯하다. 奇壯하다. 이내 運數奇壯하다. 龜尾山水 됴흔 勝地無極大道 닥가내니 5萬年之運數로다. (下略-원문)

道德詞
無知한 世上사람 아는 바 天地라도 敬畏之心 업섯스니 아는 것이 무엇이며 天上에 上帝님이 玉京臺에 계시다고 보는 듯이 말을 하니 陰陽理致姑舍하고 虛無之說 아닐넌가. 漢나라 巫蠱事가 我東方傳헤 와서 집집마다 爲한 것이 名色마다 鬼神일세.
이런 知覺 구경하소. 天地亦是 鬼神이오 鬼神亦是 陰陽인 줄 이 가티 몰낫스니 經傳 살펴 무엇하며 道와 德을 몰나스니 賢人君子 엇지알리. 沒沒한 知覺者는 옹총망총하는 말이 至今은 老天이라 靈驗조차 업거니와 몹슬 사람 富貴하고 어진 사람 窮迫하다 하는 말이 이뿐이오. 若干 엇지 修身하면 地閥보고 家勢보아 趨勢해서 하는 말이 아모는 地閥도 됴커니와 文筆이 有餘하니 道德君子 分明타고 冒沒廉恥 推尊하니 우숩다. 저 사람은 地閥이 무엇이게 君子를 比喩하며 文筆이 무엇이게 道德을 議論하노. 나도 또한 이 世上에 布衣寒士 뿐이라도 天理야 모를소냐. 사람의 手足動靜, 이는 역시 鬼神이오. 善惡間 마음用事 이는 亦是 氣運이오 말하고 웃는 것은 이는 亦是 造化로세.
