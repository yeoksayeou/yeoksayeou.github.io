**Summary**

This article presents a digest of social news from February 1922 in colonial Korea. It covers a range of topics including the expansion of the magazine *Kaebyŏk*'s publishing rights, changes in school enrollment procedures, the death of Japanese elder statesman Yamagata Aritomo, the launch of the literary magazine *Paekcho*, the founding of the Chosŏn Boy Scouts, the sale of a royal art workshop, petitions regarding school locations and broker associations, the conclusion of the Washington Conference, the election of a new Pope, a major football tournament, a school fire, a decision on state-run land reclamation, the formation of a tenant farmers' aid group, the suicide of a prominent student, a large academic lecture series, a major fire in Seoul, and a visit by French Marshal Joffre. From a historical perspective, the entries reveal the burgeoning civil society activities (literary magazines, youth groups, sports associations, student events, tenant farmer groups) despite colonial constraints. They also show the administrative actions of the Japanese colonial government (school procedures, state-run enterprises, handling petitions), economic activities (sale of royal assets, Monopoly Bureau fire), and Korea's connection to international events (Washington Conference, Papal election, Joffre's visit). The mention of *Kaebyŏk* securing rights for political commentary and the formation of various Korean groups hints at the undercurrents of cultural and potentially nationalist activity during the so-called "Cultural Rule" period.
