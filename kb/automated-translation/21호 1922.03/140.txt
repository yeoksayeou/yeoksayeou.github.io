Article Type: 시 (Poem)

The terrible blood of the beloved one that reddened the whole land,
Knowing it was solely meant for this body of mine to live well,
I think of it again and bow my head, weeping.

Toddling as if yesterday, lingering like today,
On the bright path of growing steps, not realizing how easy it has become,
Later, even if I trip on a stone, I know new strength will arise.

Whether straight or crooked, whether far or near,
Whether muddy or dry, I know none of it.
Rather than this path being *the* path, it is merely a foreshadowing.<87>

**Summary**

This poem, titled "Third Anniversary" and published on March 1, 1922, commemorates the sacrifices made three years prior, strongly suggesting the March First Movement of 1919. The speaker expresses deep gratitude and a sense of indebtedness to those who shed blood ("the beloved one's terrible blood") for the future ("for this body of mine to live well"). Despite acknowledging the slow and sometimes unsteady progress made since then ("toddling," "lingering," "tripping on a stone"), the poem conveys a resilient hope for the future, seeing the current path, however uncertain, as a step towards an ultimate goal ("new strength will arise," "merely a foreshadowing"). For historians, the poem is significant as it reflects the complex emotions – remembrance, survivor's guilt, persistent hope, and acknowledgment of the ongoing struggle – prevalent among Koreans in the early colonial period, particularly in relation to the March First Movement's legacy. The author's location, "from T'apkol" (Tapgol Park, the site where the Declaration of Independence was read), further reinforces this connection.

세돌
						탑골에서 한샘
왼울을 붉혀노신 끔찍한 임의피가
오로지 이내한몸 잘살라 하심인줄
다시금 생각하옵고 고개숙여 웁내다

어제런듯 아장이다 오늘가치 강둥거려
느는거름 환한길에 갓븐줄 모르괘라
잇다가 돌뿌리채도 새힘날줄 알리라

바르거니 빗둘거니 멀거니 갓갑거니
질거니 마르거니 나는다 모르옵네
이길이 그길이라기 예고옐뿐이옵네＜87＞
