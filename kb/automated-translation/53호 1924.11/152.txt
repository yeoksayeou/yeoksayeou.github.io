Hamnam's Equilibrium of "He is a Man, I am a Man"

If someone were to ask me, "You have seen most of the thirteen provinces of Chosŏn; which province among them is the best?" I would answer without hesitation, "Hamgyŏngnam-do would be the best among them." If they ask again, "Why is that?" it is as follows.

First, Hamnam is a very good place for people to live geographically. The mountains are good, the fields are good, and even the climate is good. In the back, the mountainous areas of Kapsan, Samsu, Changjin, P'ungsan, and Hŭng [likely Hŭngnam/Yŏnghŭng region] have many aspects unsuitable for human life due to climate and natural features, but there are inexhaustible forests and gold and silver, and it is not that there are no agricultural products suitable for those regions, so it is by no means an unlivable place. In the front, areas like Anbyŏn, Tŏkwŏn, Munch'ŏn, Kowŏn, Yŏnghŭng, Chŏngp'yŏng, Hamhŭng, Hongwŏn, Pukch'ŏng, Iwŏn, and Tanch'ŏn have great mountains and high peaks behind them and the vast blue sea stretching thousands of *ri* before them – with fertile lands and good fields placed in between, possessing both sea and land, providing both clothing and food sufficiently. The fish products of the East Coast are world-famous, and the five great plains of Anbyŏn, Yŏnghŭng, Hamhŭng, Pukch'ŏng, and Tanch'ŏn are famous in Hamgyŏng-do. Also, the climate, being a blend of continental and oceanic types, is suitable for human health, aside from agricultural products, and transportation is also convenient. The Hamgyŏng Line penetrates the eleven coastal counties, the first-class road from Wŏnsan to Hoeryŏng also passes through, there is a newly built road from Hamhŭng to Sinhŭng and Changjin, a second-class road from Pukch'ŏng to P'ungsan, Kapsan, and Hyesanjin, and a third-class road (future first-class national highway route) from Changjin, Singap'o, Hyesanjin, to Musan, providing convenience for automobiles and ox-carts. Besides these, a coal mine railway between Hamhŭng and Changjin is under construction, and a colonial development railway between Tanch'ŏn and Hyesanjin (route not confirmed) is being planned. Overall, transportation is also convenient, making it extremely convenient for people to live.

Second, Hamnam has no classes. There is no wealth or poverty, nor are there *sangban* (upper class) (although it's not completely flat, generally speaking). That is to say, it's not that everyone is rich, nor is everyone poor; rather, each person possesses enough constant property (恒産) to maintain their livelihood. It's not that everyone is *yangban* (aristocracy), nor is everyone *sanghan* (commoner); generally, they live on an equal footing, in the manner of 'He is a man, I am a man (彼丈夫我丈夫)'.<110>

This is not hearsay, nor is it conjecture or self-judgment. It is spoken with the responsibility of having conducted an actual survey. Due to the lack of detailed footprints, there might be some corners missed, but this is generally the case. Even asking in Tanch'ŏn, they say there are no residents in the county who do not possess at least one *mu* (畝) of field and one house (一畝田一棟家). Asking in Iwŏn, they say the landlord-tenant problem does not yet exist. In Pukch'ŏng, even before being asked, they tell you, "Our county has traditionally been a communist country (共産國)." Even in P'ungsan and Kapsan, although it might be oat rice and potato cakes, there is absolutely no reason to starve from hunger. I wonder how it is south of Hamhŭng; perhaps there will be a report from Pukch'ŏng County, but in any case, north of Hamhŭng, I did not witness class suffering (excluding the living conditions of laborers or fishermen in coastal port areas, mainly focusing on farmers).
More than anything, the houses themselves indicate constant property, and also, during more than a month across seven counties, I saw no beggars or destitute travelers, nor did I see any disabled or deformed people (病身不具者). What further proof is needed?

Third, compared to other provinces, education is widespread in Hamnam. While other provinces and counties clamor for one school per three *myŏn* (sub-counties), in this province and its counties, there are many places with three schools per *myŏn* (regardless of public or private). In places like Iwŏn and Pukch'ŏng, three schools per *myŏn* are clearly evident, and even in places like P'ungsan and Kapsan, it far exceeds one school per *myŏn*. Even if it were compulsory education, what more could be done in such remote mountain areas?
There are details for each county, so there is no need for repetitive words. In any case, the essential conditions for human life—climate and natural features—are suitable, sea and land products are sufficient, and education is widespread. What other conditions could there be? And finally, one more word to add is:
"What is the future of Hamnam?" That is it. In other words, the current situation, while not entirely sufficient, cannot be said to be inadequate. The question is whether it will maintain its current state in the future, or degenerate, or develop further.

According to the principle of evolution (進化), progress will undoubtedly occur, but in the reality of the struggle for existence (生存競爭), decline (退敗) will also not be absent. It is thus left to the self-determination (自決) of the Hamnam brothers. However,
I trust the Hamnam brothers. I trust them based on past facts. The saying "There have been many successful people (成功者多矣)" has long been said referring to Hamgyŏng-do. The labels "diligent and frugal (勤儉)" and "persevering (堅忍)" for both men and women are also praises directed towards the people of Hamgyŏng-do.
Diligence and frugality! Perseverance! Where could one go and not prevail! However, Hamgyŏng-do is also Chosŏn land (朝鮮), and the people of Hamgyŏng-do are also Chosŏn people. In this Chosŏn, collapsing politically and economically, how will they fight and win? Along with doubt, I pray for their final victory.<111>

It is said that in Hamgyŏng-do, the hand of the Tongch'ŏk (東拓 - Oriental Development Company) and the foot of the Chiksŏn (殖産 - Industrial Bank) have relatively less reach. It is said that the influence of the Japanese is generally less. However, the forests are owned by the Forestry Station (營林廠), fishing rights are also being transferred to the Japanese, and mineral resources are also possessed by the Japanese. What is actually left? Moreover, the Hamgyŏng Line is being opened. Ah—the welcome yet fearsome Hamgyŏng Line is being opened. Ah—the terrifying iron horse (鐵馬), intending to swallow the entire landmass (왼떵이), rolls and runs.<112>

**Summary**

The author praises Hamgyŏngnam-do as the best province in Korea, citing its favorable geography, abundant resources (forestry, mining, agriculture, fishing), relatively developed transportation, widespread education, and, most uniquely, a perceived lack of rigid class distinctions, describing it as a society where people interact as equals ("He is a Man, I am a Man"). Despite this positive assessment of the present and faith in the diligent nature of its people, the author expresses deep concern about the future. The article concludes with apprehension about increasing Japanese colonial encroachment, noting the control of forests, fishing rights, and mines by Japanese interests and the potentially devastating impact of the new Hamgyŏng railway line, seen as a tool for further exploitation. For historians, the article offers a valuable contemporary perspective on regional identity and social structure in colonial Korea, particularly the claim of relative social equality in Hamnam. It also starkly reveals Korean anxieties about the expansion of Japanese economic control over resources and infrastructure in the mid-1920s, specifically mentioning the Oriental Development Company (Tongch'ŏk) and the Forestry Stations (Yŏngnimch'ang).

彼丈夫我丈夫의 咸南均勢
누가 만약 나에게 뭇기를「그대는 朝鮮十三道를 大槪보앗스니 十三道中엇던 道가 그 中낫든가」하면 나는 서슴지안코「咸鏡南道가 그 中 낫겟다」고 對答하련다「왜그러냐」고 다시 무르면 이럿다
咸南은 첫재 地勢上으로 사람살기가 매우 조흔 곳이다 山조코 들조코 氣候지 좃타 뒤로 甲山, 三水, 長津, 豊山,  興의 山地帶는 氣候와 風土의 關係로 人間生活에 不適의 便이 만타하나 無盡藏의 山林과 金銀이 잇고  그 地方에 適當한 農作物이 업는 바 안이니 決코 못살 곳이 안이요 압흐로 安邊, 德原, 文川, 高原, 永興, 定平, 咸興, 洪原, 北靑, 利原, 端川 等地는 뒤로 泰山峻嶺 압흐로 滄海萬里-그 中間에 沃土良田을 노앗나니 海陸이 兼備에 衣食이 俱足하다 東海岸魚産은 世界的으로 有名하거니와 安邊, 永興, 咸興, 北靑 端川의 五大平野는 咸鏡道에 有名하다 그리고 氣候가 大陸性海洋性이 調和되야 農作物은 次置하고 人體의 健康에 適하며 交通이 한 便하니 咸鏡線이 海岸十一郡을 貫通하며 元山至會寧의 一等路가 又貫하고 咸興으로 新興, 至長津의 新作路가 잇고 北靑으로 豊山, 甲山, 至惠山鎭의 二等路가 잇고, 長津, 新嘉坡, 惠山鎭, 至荗山의 三等路(將來一等國道線)가 잇서 自動車牛馬車의 便이 잇고 此外에 咸興長津間炭鑛鐵道가 敷設中이요 端川惠山間(線路未確)拓植鐵道를 計劃하는 中이니 大體로 交通도 便하야 사람살기에 極히 便하다
둘재로 咸南은 階級이 업다 貧富도 업고 常班도 업다(아조 平面格은 안이지만 大槪로)卽一體富者도 안이요 一體貧者도 안이요 各各生活維持는 하리만치 恒産을 가젓다는 말이요 一體兩班도 안이요 一體常漢도 안이요 大體로 平等한 界線에서 彼丈夫我丈夫格으로 지낸다＜110＞
이것은 드른 風月도 안이요 推測自斷도 안이다 實地踏査의 責任을 지고하는 말이다 足迹이 細密치 못한 關係上 或-구석지는 곳도 잇겟지만은 大體는 그러하다 端川에 問하야도 該郡住民으로 一畝田一棟家 안이가진 者 업다하며 利原에서 問하야도 地主小作人問題는 아직 업다하며 北靑에서는 뭇기도 前에「吾郡是自來의 共産國」을 말해주며 豊, 甲山도 비록 귀리밥 감저일망정 배곱하 못살 理는 萬無하다고 한다 咸興以南은 엇더한지 靑吾郡의 報告가 잇겟거니와 엇잿든 咸興以北에서 階級苦는 보지 못하얏다 (海岸港口處의 勞働者又는 漁業者의 生活狀態는 除하고 主로 農民)
무엇보다 家屋부터가 恒産을 表示하며 한 七郡月餘에 乞人窮客을 못보앗스며 한 病身不具者를 못보앗나니 다시 더 證明이 무엇이랴
셋재로 咸南은 他道에 比하야 敎育이 普及되얏다 他道他郡은 三面一校를 부르짓지만 此道此郡은 一面三校되는 곳이 만타(公私立은 不關)利原北靑갓튼데는 一面三校가 歷歷하고 豊山甲山가튼데도 一面一校는 훨적 넘으니 비록 義務敎育이라한들 山間僻地에서 此以上엇지하랴
各郡別示가 잇스니 累言할 必要가 업다 如何間 人間生活의 主要條件인 氣候風土가 適하고 海陸産物이 足하고 敎育이 普及되얏다하니 此以上別條件이 업겟다 그러고 最終으로 一言을 加할 것은
「咸南의 將來如何」린 그것이다 卽現況은 그만하면 足하다할 수는 업스나 不及이라고는 하지 못하겟는데 將來도 그 現狀을 維持하겟느냐 或은 退化이겟느냐 或은 보다 以上으로 發展이겟느냐가 問題이다
進化의 原則에 依하야 毋論進展도 되겟지만 生存競爭의 現實에서 한 退敗도 업지 안을 터이니 咸南兄弟의 自決에 任할밧게 업다 그런데
나는 咸南兄弟를 信任한다 過去의 事實에서 信任한다 自古로「成功者多矣」라는 말은 咸鏡道을 두고 일너온 말이다 男女-共히 勤儉하고 堅忍하다는 標語도 咸鏡道人士에게 도라가는 讚辭이다
勤儉!堅忍!어대가서 못이기랴!그러나 咸鏡道도 亦朝鮮이요 咸鏡道民도 亦朝鮮民이니 政治로 經濟로 막 쓰러지는 이 朝鮮에서 엇더케 싸와 이길넌지? 疑問과 同時에 最後勝을 祝한다＜111＞
咸鏡道에는 比較的東拓의 手와 殖産의 足이 들밋첫다 한다 一體로 日本人의 勢力이 들하다 한다 그러나 森林은 營林廠이 가젓고 漁業權도 日人에게 넘어가게되고 鑛産도 日人이 가젓나니 實上남은 것이 무엇이냐 더구나 咸鏡線이 開通된다 아-반갑고도 무서운 咸鏡線이 開通된다. 아-왼떵이를 집어생키려는 무서운 鐵馬가 구을너 다
