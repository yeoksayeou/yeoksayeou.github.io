Two Hanja Poems

Tongnae Hot Spring (東萊溫泉)
鑿石通中引水長, (Chiseling stone, channeling water long within,)
東西屈曲擧羊腸. (East and west it winds and bends like sheep intestines.)
一經溫浴心神快, (Once bathed in the warm waters, heart and mind are refreshed,)
笑看黃花立夕陽. (Smiling, I watch yellow flowers stand in the setting sun.)

Reflections on Kyerim (鷄林懷古)
半月城頭半月傾, (Above Panwŏl Fortress, the half-moon tilts,)
今來追憶古時情. (Coming here now, I recall the sentiments of ancient times.)
六部村容新制度, (The forms of the Six Villages, the new systems,)
五陵石面舊文明. (The stone faces of the Five Tombs, the old civilization.)
玉笛寥寥歸廢物, (The Jade Flute, desolate, has become a relic,)
星臺丌丌有虛名. (The Star Platform stands tall, holding but an empty name.)
雲空水逝千年事, (Clouds scatter, waters flow—a thousand years of affairs,)
謾使行人百感生. (Pointlessly causing travelers to feel a hundred emotions.)<62>
<59-62>

**Summary**

The article presents two classical Chinese poems (Hansi). The first, "Tongnae Hot Spring," describes the pleasant experience of visiting the hot springs, noting the channels carved for the water and the feeling of refreshment while enjoying the scenery. The second poem, "Reflections on Kyerim," expresses nostalgia and melancholy while visiting the historical site of Kyerim (ancient Silla), contrasting the past glory represented by Panwŏl Fortress, the Six Villages, the Five Tombs, the legendary Jade Flute, and the Ch'ŏmsŏngdae observatory with their current state of decline or mere historical memory, evoking a sense of loss over the passage of time. For historians, these poems offer insight into how Koreans in the 1920s engaged with both simple pleasures and their nation's diminished past glory during the colonial period, expressing subtle feelings of nostalgia and perhaps lament through the traditional medium of Hanja poetry.
