Regarding the Hamgyŏng Line Opening and to Our Brothers in North Hamgyŏng

Friends who live shut away in mountain villages (山村에 蟄居하야), just farming, visiting neighbors, maybe visiting their parents' or in-laws' homes every other year, and going to their local town market every other month, chatter excitedly without knowing much:
"Hey, they say the train (汽車) will reach Yanghwa (陽化) around the tenth of October!"
"Ah—the tenth of October? What date is it on the solar calendar today? Not much time left now," they chatter, as if some great fortune has come their way. Hearing this, the shaggy-haired bachelor boys (總角놈) jump around for joy, sideways and forwards, thrilled about seeing the train. Meanwhile, the bent-backed old geezer (허리흐라진 영감쟁이) sighs deeply (長太息), saying, "I'm old and bent over, I'd have to walk quite a bit just to see it." This is the great spectacle (大光景) happening lately in every village along the Hamgyŏng Line (咸鏡線).

That's right. As of October 11th, the Hamgyŏng Line will be open from Wŏnsan (退潮) to Pukch'ŏng Yanghwa Market (北靑陽化場). It will all be open from Kyŏngsŏng (京城) to Yanghwa. And the section from Tanch'ŏn (端川) to Kilchu (吉州) will also open simultaneously. The sections not yet open are only fifty-seven *ri* (哩) from Yanghwa to Tanch'ŏn, and forty-three *ri* from Kilchu to Ponggang (鳳岡). Furthermore, the line from Kyŏngsŏng Sunam (鏡城水南) to Hoeryŏng (會寧) is now fully open. These unopened sections in between are to be connected by automobiles (自動車). Although it's not as good as a full opening, it's still good anyway. How wonderful it will be to hear the rumbling sound (우루릉우루릉) of the train every day! How wonderful it will be to travel ten *ri* by train, five *ri* by train, without getting dirt on one's feet! It feels like one's stomach is full even without eating a meal.

That's right, one must go see it. It would be regrettable (恨) to be too old and bent over to go see it. It's something worth crying over. It seems one couldn't close their eyes even in death <112>. Everyone who can possibly go, setting aside all else, agrees unanimously—they must go. And they must drool to their heart's content and stretch fully before coming back.

Brothers, jumping about without knowing anything! It's not that the train opening isn't good. But for mountain farmers (山間農民), it has no relevance whatsoever (though indirect relevance, 毋論, exists). Frequent transportation (交通頻煩) is crucially relevant (至切한 關係) to merchants and industrialists (商工民). The benefit of transportation legally belongs to those who possess superiority (優越權) in politics, economy, and knowledge. For our farmers in their current situation (今日의 現相), or for those like us whose economic and knowledge circumstances are poor (貧弱한 處地), the train opening will simultaneously bring harm (害) in a hundred ways, but not a single benefit (利). We're bound to hand over even the copper coins (銅錢分) guarded in our pockets; we're bound to buy one more cigarette (卷烟); we're bound to hear the word "Yobo!" (「ヨボ」소리 - Hey you!) one more time. There will definitely be no benefit. Is that all?

That fertile land (沃土良田) which brothers have settled on and farmed generation after generation—that, above all, is in danger (危殆). It's not that the train itself directly gobbles it up, but what's most frightening is how, because of it (討論 그것으로 因하야), things slip away smoothly, like standing on a sand dune, without much pain (痛症).

The problem of having land taken away (土地앗길 問題)! Ah! Indeed, it is more frightening than anything. There might be some who curse me back, saying, "Crazy fool, stop talking nonsense (개수작 마러라)! Why would our land be taken away?" If things turned out that way despite my curses, how fortunate (至幸) it would be! But it's difficult. Originally, the people of the Hamgyŏng Line are famous for being firm, enduring, and patient (굿고 견디고 참기로 有名하다니), so I don't know how it will be, but those people behind the train—they possess all power superior to that and are getting themselves firmly ready, thinking, "Let's see if they dare not hand it over." They might persuade with words, lure with money, and in the end, perhaps even seize it unconditionally (無條件으로 아슬넌지도 몰은다).

Moreover, with the warm sun and gentle breeze, where mountain views and water scenery (日暖風和 山光水色) are intertwined throughout the Hamgyŏng Line area, who wouldn't drool (침을 안이생키랴)? "Let's see if we can take it." "Let's see if you can avoid losing it." "I won't hand it over, even if I die." "I absolutely must get in there." When we realize the day for such fights is not far off, I feel great terror (恐怖) coinciding with the opening of the Hamgyŏng Line.

Hopefully, brothers of the North (北鮮兄弟)! Secure the blessed land (福地) of the brothers forever. <113>

**Summary**

This article expresses deep skepticism and fear regarding the newly opened sections of the Hamgyŏng railway line in northern Korea. While acknowledging the superficial excitement among some locals, the author argues that the railway primarily benefits the powerful (merchants, industrialists, those with political and economic superiority – implicitly the Japanese colonizers and their collaborators), not the poor farmers. The author warns that the railway's arrival heralds not progress but danger, specifically the imminent threat of losing ancestral farmlands to outsiders who will use persuasion, money, or force. The piece ends with a plea for the local "brothers" to protect their land.

For historians, this article is valuable as it provides a contemporary Korean perspective on colonial infrastructure development, countering the often-promoted narrative of modernization bringing universal benefits. It highlights the anxieties of the colonized populace, particularly the fear of dispossession and economic exploitation facilitated by improved transportation, which integrated peripheral regions more tightly into the colonial economy often to the detriment of local inhabitants. The mention of hearing "Yobo!" more often directly points to increased interaction with and likely subservience to Japanese authority figures.

咸鏡線開通과 北鮮兄弟에게
山村에 蟄居하야 農事나 지어먹고 이웃집 出入이나하고 해걸러 外家妻家에나 다녀보고 달걸러 自邑場이나 보아먹는 친구들이 멋도 모르고 떠드는 말이
「여보게 十月열흘께면 汽車가 陽化지 온대야」
「아- 十月열흘?오늘이 陽曆멧츨인구? 이제 얼마 안이 남엇네」하고 바로 무슨 큰 數나 생긴 듯이 떠든다 이말을 듯는 더벙머리 總角놈은 汽車구경간다고 조와라고 가로고 세로며 허리흐라진 영감쟁이는「나야 늙어으라젓스니 거름을 거러야 구경이라도 가지」하며 長太息을 發한다 요것이 咸鏡線一帶에 村마다 생기는 近日의 大光景이다
그럿타 咸鏡線은 十月十一日로써 退潮에서 北靑陽化場지 開通된다 京城서 陽化지는 다 開通된다 그리고 端川서 吉州지도 同時에 開通된다 이제 未開通은 陽化서 端川지 五十七哩 吉州서 鳳岡지 四十三哩이다 그다음 鏡城水南서 會寧지도 全部開通이 되얏다 이 中間未開通地点은 自動車로 連結을 하게되얏다 全部開通만은 못하지만 엇잿든 조켓다 날마다 우루릉우루릉 汽車가는 소리를 듯게되얏스니 얼마나 조흐랴 十里를 가도 汽車 五里를 가도 汽車 발에 흙을 안이뭇치게 되얏스니 얼마나 조흐랴 밥을 한끼식 안먹어도 배가 불는 것이다
그럿치 求景을 가야겟다 늙어으라저 구경못가는 것이 恨이겟다 울만한 일이다 죽어도 눈이 안이 감길 모양＜112＞이다 萬事都廢하고 갈만한 사람은 擧口一致로다-가야 하겟다 그리고 침도 슬컷 흘니고 기지게도 실컷하고 와야된다
멋도 모르고 날는 兄弟들아 汽車開通이 조치안은 바는 안이다 그러나 山間農民에게는 何等關係가 업다(間接關係는 毋論잇지만)交通頻煩이란 商工民에게 至切한 關係가 잇다 政治로 經濟로 知識으로 모든 優越權을 가진 者에게 交通의 利는 잇는 法이다 今日의 現相에 在한 우리 農民에게는 는 우리와 가티 經濟와 知識이 貧弱한 處地로는 汽車開通과 同時에 百方으로 害는 잇슬지언뎡. 하나도 利는 업슬 것이다 주머니 직키는 銅錢分이라도 가저다 밧치게 되얏고 卷烟한개라도 더 사먹게 되얏고「ヨボ」소리 한마듸도 더 듯게 되얏다 決코 利될 것은 업다 그이랴
兄弟들이 代代로 내려오며 고안저 파먹든 그 -沃土良田-무엇보다 그것이 危殆하다 汽車그 物件이 直接집어생키는 것도 討論 그것으로 因하야 別로 痛症업시 모래언덕에 선 것 가티 슬슬 흘러드는 것이 가장 무섭다
土地앗길 問題! 아! 果然무엇보다 무섭다「밋친놈 개수작 마러라 土地를 왜 앗겨-」하고 도로혀 나를 辱할 者도 잇스리라 辱을 먹어도 그런다면 얼마나 至幸이랴 그러나 어렵다 本來 咸鏡線사람이 굿고 견디고 참기로 有名하다니 엇덜넌지 모르나 저-汽車의 뒤에선 사람들은 그 以上의 모든 勢力을 가지고「어디 안이 내놋코 백이나 보자」하고 단단이들 차림새를 하고잇다 말로 이고 돈으로 꼬이고 맛츰내는 無條件으로 아슬넌지도 몰은다
더군다나 日暖風和 山光水色이 두루엉킨 咸鏡線一帶이랴 누가 침을 안이생키랴「어듸 앗나보자」「어듸 안이 앗기나 보자」「죽어도 나는 안이 내놋는다」「期於코 나는 드러가야겟다」이러케 싸울 날이 머지 안임을 알 때에 咸鏡線開通과 同時에 나는 큰 恐怖를 가진다
