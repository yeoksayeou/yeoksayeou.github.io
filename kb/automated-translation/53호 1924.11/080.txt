A Factual Account of Seeing Greece, Turkey, and Austria
						By Pak Sŭngch'ŏl

The 3,000-Year-Old Ancient Capital, Athens
Don't even mention how dirty Piraeus (피로이스) Port is. It's not that there aren't clean places with white sand and blue seas if you go to the coast over there, but how is it that the city streets are neck and neck with Shanghai (上海) or Hong Kong (香港)? Inch'ŏn (인천) port is not far from Kyŏngsŏng (京城), so one can't know how much cleaner it is than this. How can I, who haven't seen Inch'ŏn, make that comparison? It's also ridiculous that I, born and raised in Kyŏngsŏng, am talking about Greece without having seen Inch'ŏn. Through the arrangement of a guide, I arrived in Athens (雅典) in about twenty minutes by tram, but inns were full everywhere, and only first-class inns remained. However, I couldn't sleep outdoors. After spending two nights, I moved to another inn. That night, I received a visit from bedbugs. Not only here, but I also saw bedbugs in restaurants. Having traveled through various European countries, this is the first time I've seen bedbugs. Don't even mention the red mountains and dust of Italy. Athens city itself is surrounded by mountains on three sides, but it's just rocks and soil; even if you strain your eyes, you can't see a single blade of grass, there isn't a single tree by the roadside, and dust rises from the sandy ground making it impossible to open your eyes. Just one outing makes your shoes look like they fell into a flour sack. Because of this, the shoe-shining business is worth doing. On every corner, in every alley, there are people shining shoes; not only are these numerous, but movie theaters and cafes also seem quite plentiful. As for cafes, half are indoors and half have chairs placed on the thoroughfare where people sit, smoke water pipes (水烟筒), and drink coffee, but you couldn't imagine how much cold water they drink. This cafe system seems to be the same in all European countries except Germany. It's no wonder they drink so much cold water. Although it was early May, the heat was no different from mid-summer.
Greeks, like Italians, are short, their faces are not very white,<44> and their hair is black. If you want to see tall stature and white faces, you should go to Sweden (瑞典) or Norway (諾威). Don't even mention how good the physique of both men and women is there. Seeing this, perhaps southern peoples are short and brown-faced. The streets of Athens, where such people live, are not very impressive, and there is nothing but the Acropolis (아크로폴릐스) ruins. Who doesn't know that ancient Greek civilization shone brightly? However, this is not as good as the present shining, and the prosperity of former days is not as good as the prosperity of today. Greece, having fallen from this principle, is worse than the backward nations, which needs no further mention. Even if the fountainhead of European civilization lies in Greece, today Greece must learn from the backward nations. Combining Athens and Piraeus, the population is only 240,000, and the goods displayed in the market or the way they are bought and sold are just like what one sees at Kyŏngsŏng's Namdaemun Market. Though small, the University, library, and Academy, which are well adorned with colorful paintwork (丹靑), are gathered in one place, which must be convenient. The National Museum is just a small building containing ancient pottery and human statues, and besides that, only tin utensils. Compared to the various museums in Italy, these are not even worth discussing.
Let's seek out the Acropolis, a relic from the legendary era over thirty centuries ago. Built on a low mountain with marble, after braving wind and rain (櫛風沐雨) for thirty centuries, only the marble pillars, walls, and stairs remain, so the former appearance cannot be seen again. It only greets tens of thousands upon tens of thousands of people from all corners of the world, with different faces and different languages, 365 days a year. According to legend, it was a royal palace, and the marble gate next to it is said to have been built after the Persian War around the 5th century BC, and the gate at Unter den Linden (운터덴린덴) in Berlin (伯林) is said to be modeled after it. Also, next to it, there is a marble statue of the Greek goddess Athena; she held a spear in her left hand, and the tip of the spear was coated with gold, so on a fine day, the gold would glitter in the sunlight, and from this <45> the city name Athens (雅典) is said to have originated, but it cannot be seen now. Although it is said that Greece is not inferior to Italy in terms of marble production, where did they bring all that large marble from, and the stonework (治石) is also done so well. It seems that the marble buildings seen in various parts of Italy were learned from Greece. One should not only admire the grand and exquisite marble buildings in Italy but should admire the Acropolis, which is older than Rome (羅馬), even more. The Greeks of over 3,000 years ago created such architecture that could astonish modern people 3,000 years later; one can know how brightly that civilization shone at that time. The stadium, with seats made of marble for over ten thousand people, is well-made. It is said that ancient people also gave speeches here.
If Italians are the people of art, Greeks could be called the people of philosophy. In various places in Italy, I always heard music. On the streets, in cafes, in inns, in restaurants, there was rarely a time when I didn't hear music. Even if there wasn't a permanent orchestra, there were bands that went around this restaurant and that cafe, playing music and collecting small change (分錢) from the customers. But this cannot be seen in Greece. If Greeks are indeed the people of philosophy, then contemplation must be their primary hobby, and sitting quietly in silent thought (靜坐黙想) must hold infinite interest for them. Don't even mention how many beggars there are in Italy. In Greece, there are so many that one could call it uncountable (不可勝數). While staying in Athens for a week waiting for a ship, I faced great hardship (大困境) due to the heat during the day and bedbugs at night. It's no wonder that inns in Athens are always full. This place has truly become a crossroads for those coming from Italy, Turkey (土耳其), and other Balkan Peninsula (빨칸半島) nations; the number of foreigners seems quite large even at a glance.

Two Fedora Hats Among the Fezzes
Leaving hot and bedbug-ridden Athens, taking a ship from Piraeus and departing the continent felt refreshing, and heading towards the eastern end of Europe (歐羅巴) to see strange customs and manners (奇風異習) was also delightful. This sea voyage was shorter than the previous one and as calm as sitting in a room. Islands were scattered closely on both sides, or else we traveled right along the coast, making it seem like one could reach out and grab tree branches. As we got closer to Turkey, the number of cannon batteries (砲臺) installed along the coasts of both Greece and Turkey looked frighteningly numerous. Modern people call this national defense (國防). Arriving at Constantinople (君士坦堡) Port, the pier was already covered in red fezzes (赤帽). I entrusted myself to a red-fezzed guide to handle immigration procedures, baggage inspection, and even finding an inn.<46> Fortunately, the guide knew English, and the inn knew German, so from then on, there was no difficulty due to language barriers.
Sometimes when entering shops or restaurants, only French is understood, but compared to Athens, the fact that German is more widely understood might be a trace of the former German Empire's "3B Policy" (三B정책). Constantinople was the former capital of the Ottoman Empire (土耳其帝國), but since becoming a republic, Angora (안고라) is the capital. The former might of the Ottoman Empire goes without saying, but since the early 19th century, the European powers openly and fiercely plotted to occupy Constantinople. However, it wasn't that Turkey had the strength to prevent it, but rather it stemmed from the idea that since neither I nor you can have it, it's better policy (良策) to let Turkey preserve it. Russia (露國) established it as a national policy, thinking it advantageous to seize Constantinople (君府) to break out of the Black Sea (黑海) and advance onto the world stage. Even the Russian Empire (露帝國) that held such a national policy has collapsed, and the Ottoman Empire, like meat on a chopping block (俎上肉塊), has also fallen apart. How can we, looking at Constantinople, not feel the passage of time (今昔之感)?
The streets of Constantinople, with a population of over 1.5 million (Note: This seems incorrect, likely 1,050,000 based on the text `일백오천여만`), are reasonably well-made, but large buildings are not visible. In the city center, a large iron bridge spans across; it was constructed by Germans, a toll is collected for passage, and underneath it connects the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. The uncleanliness of the streets is the same as Athens, and the peddlers (呼賣商) are just like in Venice (베늬쓰). If you go behind the main streets, there are wooden storied houses (木製層屋). Seeing this reminded me of life in Tokyo (東京). Not only are there wooden storied houses, but like German cities, there are also areas where residences are neither too high nor too low (不高不卑) and neatly arranged. However, generally, it seems inferior to Germany. In this large city, there isn't a single factory, so the number of unemployed is beyond imagination, and anyone can see unemployed men wearing fezzes standing on street corners looking for meager earnings (버리자리).<47> Adults wear fezzes, children wear fezzes, everyone wears fezzes. Only newly arrived foreigners don't wear fezzes; foreigners who have stayed even a little while also wear fezzes. When you go out on the street, you can immediately tell if someone is a foreigner or a local. You can tell by the hat; wherever we looked, the two of us were two fedora hats (中折帽) among the fezzes. The custom of women covering their faces with black cloth (黑褓) when going out, and washing their faces, hands, and feet in the mosque (回回敎堂) and bowing hundreds and thousands of times during worship is also a unique custom. The Hagia Sophia (쏘피아 교당) is said to be the largest among them. This mosque was first built by the Byzantines (삐싼틘人) and worshipped many gods; then, during the Eastern Roman Empire, it became a Christian church (耶蘇敎교당); and after that, it became a mosque. At the southern end of the mosque, there is a hole in a marble pillar; if you put your finger in the hole and turn it, tears come out, and this is said to be the tears of Jesus. This story was made up due to the discord between Muslims (回回敎徒) and Christians (예수교도). Besides that, on the upper part of the central pillar (車便중간기동), there is a footprint (솊�자족); this is said to be the footprint of Mehmet II (모하메트 2세) from 1453 AD. This also doesn't sound plausible. How could a hand reach the top, over two spans high, even if on horseback, and it's unthinkable that a footprint would remain after 500 years. Inside this mosque too, there is a large water container (水桶) filled with water for washing face, hands, and feet.

Byzantine Era Reservoir and Recreation Area
When Constantinople was in the hands of the Byzantines (삐싼틘人), they, concerned about emergencies, dug the ground and made a reservoir. It is said that later people didn't know about it and discovered it recently. Even now, if you go inside, water is deeply pooled in a place about two spans deep. Relics from the Byzantine era are not limited to this. There is a market similar to Kyŏngsŏng's licensed stores (京城立廛); if you go inside, it's dim even in broad daylight (白晝), making it difficult to quickly recognize goods. There are all sorts of miscellaneous goods (萬種雜貨), gold, silver, jewels (金銀珠玉), silks and brocades (綾羅錦繡), and even restaurants, but selling goods while sitting in these shops (廛房) is no different from Kyŏngsŏng's licensed stores. They sit on cushions spread on the floor and persistently ask foreigners to buy things. The haggling over prices is extreme. The guide said this: If a merchant asks for 100, offer only one. Besides this, there are things from the Turkish era. Everywhere, the sound of people clamoring (와글와글) can be heard. The Sweet Waters recreation area (甘水유흥지) seems to be about 20 ri (approx. 8 km) from Constantinople. On Fridays, the Muslim holiday, the hills and fields are said to form a sea of people (人山人海). To my eyes, it doesn't seem like a particularly good place. There are low mountains on the left and right, and in the center, a small stream flows into the Black Sea. This stream doesn't look clean, nor does the water seem sweet. However, the Turkish people call this place <48> the Sweet Waters recreation area, and women prepare food in baskets (보통이), come here, and spend a day relaxing (消暢) on the grass. It is said that on Fridays, all sorts of spectacles gather here, and all kinds of food stalls assemble, making the day's pleasure (歡樂) hard to imagine. On this day too, groups of people were gathered here and there, sitting, drinking, and eating. Near this recreation area, there is a girls' orphanage; thanks to the principal's special kindness (好竟), I was able to tour the school thoroughly (縱覽). This school is said to accommodate daughters of those who died during the European Great War (歐洲大戰時) and the recent Greco-Turkish War (希土戰爭時). A female teacher was specially assigned to show everything. Classrooms, workshops, dining hall, dormitory, and everything else were shown without missing a single thing. Modeled after those in recently advanced countries, how could any of it be ordinary (凡然)? It's said they teach various handicrafts (手工) and other household skills (살림살이) as part of the school curriculum. At that time, the female teacher gave detailed explanations, and upon seeing her once, her character seemed remarkably gentle. It seemed rare to see such a distinct and womanly woman. What great fortune it must be for those black-haired, yellow-faced (黑髮黃顔) young girls to have such a female teacher in such a well-equipped place. Generally, Turkish people resemble us, and the women especially look similar to Korean women (朝鮮婦女). Lastly, let me note that Turkey has beautiful scenery (物色) and is a prohibitionist country (禁酒國). Prohibition is so strict that even beer is banned, so restaurants sell beer in coffee cups. The Imperial Palace by the sea is also well-built. The gate is made of marble, and inside that magnificent building, the Sultan who ruled the territory spanning the two continents of Europe and Asia must have resided (起居), but today it stands empty, and the glory (榮華) of former days has vanished.

Paddy Fields and Thatched Houses Along the Railway
From Constantinople to Sofia (쏘퓌아), the capital of Bulgaria (뿔가리아國), takes about 30 hours by train; this is because it's an express train. If it were an ordinary train, one couldn't know how much longer it would take. In general, the slowness of trains in the Balkan Peninsula nations (빨칸반도列國) is well-known (有所聞). The so-called express train stops at every station, making it indistinguishable from an ordinary train. There is nothing worth seeing along the sides, left and right, and no signs of human cultivation (人工) are visible in the mountains and fields. In other places, one would expect to see large cities or signs of cultivation in the mountains and fields. However, none of this can be seen in the Balkan Peninsula nations. The Balkan Peninsula nations are still backward (後進), seemingly concentrating all their efforts on building a few cities besides their respective capitals, and the day when they will have spare capacity seems far off. Along the railway, there are only thatched houses (草家) and paddy fields (水田), just like those seen along the Korean railways (朝鮮鐵道沿邊). Thatched houses are most numerous within Turkish territory (土耳其 境內). Last January, when I went to Poland (波蘭),<49> I saw thatched houses and called it a rare sight in the European world (歐羅巴 天地). Today, seeing thatched houses in the Balkan Peninsula nations, I realized that not all of Europe is like Germany. It's not that Germany doesn't have thatched houses. I saw them last year on the way to the Nordic countries (北歐列國). However, those were thatched houses in name only; they were storied houses built with brick walls and decorated to the fullest extent. The thatched houses seen elsewhere were truly thatched houses. Built with mud walls packed little by little (족음 족음), they looked like overturned crab shells (게딱지). The inspection at the border is excessively strict. It seems the smaller the country (小國), the stricter these things are. Entering Bulgarian territory, I saw snowy scenery (雪景) again after a month. Having suffered from the heat, seeing this cool sight refreshed my spirits.
Sofia has a population of only 100,000, and rather than saying the city streets are unimpressive, they are still underdeveloped (들되엿다). In front of the station, there are many vacant lots (뷔인터), and it seems like there might be some plans. The Greek Orthodox Church (希臘正敎堂), built in the late 19th century, is not very large but worth seeing once and resembles the churches seen in Rome. The park in the city center is only about the size of Kyŏngsŏng's Pagoda Park (京城 빠고다 공원), but that small place is so packed with people that it's hard to get a chair (交椅). The former Royal Palace is quite well-built, but the university is unimpressive. How substantial could its content be when even its external appearance (外形) doesn't look satisfactory? The National Museum is just a small building, and the exhibits displayed inside are unimpressive, with only a few types of items. Among them, what catches the eye are two paintings showing how many Bulgarians were massacred by the Turks; one depicts Turks capturing Bulgarians and gouging out their eyeballs, and the other shows the massacre of the young and weak (幼弱) in front of a crowd (衆人). When we looked at the paintings, our limbs trembled (사지가 떨릴 적에); how much must Bulgarians' blood boil and flesh tremble when they see them? No matter how much I think about it, in human society, the strong preying on the weak is a false way (僞道), yet unknowingly (不知不識間), whether for nations or individuals, the law of the jungle (약육강식) has become the motto of social evolution and human life. People carry various drinks on their backs and sell them on the streets; here too, they wear shoes made from a single piece of leather, wear fur vests (털마고자) and wide trousers (통넓은 바지). Women wear long jackets (긴저고리) and wide skirts (통 넓은 치마) worn by native women, and it is also a strange custom (奇風) for farming women to carry babies wrapped in bundles (보통이) like carrying luggage.

Flooding Throughout the Belgrade Area
Due to the melting snow from the Alps (알푸스山), the Danube River (딴윰江) overflowed, flooding everywhere along the river (沿江), and a flood disaster (물란리) occurred even in Belgrade (뻘그라드), the capital of Yugoslavia (유고슬라비아 국). The train, blocked by water and unable to proceed, waited for three or four hours in the middle for the construction work to finish. The raging waves (怒濤)<50> looked like they could sweep away even Mount Tai (泰山). Refugees lived in tents pitched here and there, and houses (人家) and fields (田土) were submerged in water. In Belgrade too, along the river, it was the same situation; people startled by the water were waiting in warehouse wagons (庫間車) for the water to subside (減水). Belgrade, whether considering the city streets, the former Royal Palace, various government offices, or anything else, appears far superior to Sofia. The street in front of the Royal Palace is ultra-modern. The sidewalks (人道) and roadway (車道) are wide, trams run down the center, various shops line both sides, and though the buildings are not large, they are exquisitely built. The university is divided into two locations, but neither is very large nor particularly refined (精하지도 못하다). The park in front of the station is about the same size as the one in Sofia, and the park on the hill by the Danube riverbank is small but very well situated for viewing the distant scenery (遠景). Belgrade's population is said to be 300,000. In every aspect, it looks larger than Sofia, and the city streets show much imitation of those in advanced countries. The market was crowded with people, and vegetables like garlic (마눌), green onions (파), green peppers (풋고초), young pumpkins (애호박), and eggplants (가지) that I used to see and eat back home were laid out; after coming to the Balkans, I tasted things I hadn't tasted for several years. Taking advantage of Sunday afternoon, I went to see an opera. The theater wasn't very large but quite well-made. Due to their skillful performance, not clumsy, they received praise from the audience, and the male and female lead actors at that time sang well with good voices (목청좃케). At night, I took a walk in the riverside park. It must have been around the full moon (望日) by the lunar calendar. Moonlight filled the mountains and fields (山野), and through the middle flowed the fast-running Danube River. On both banks, in the riverside villages (江村), lingering lamps (殘燈) flickered, and countless steamships floated on the river (江上). As the wind blew and waves crashed, the moonlight reflected on the white-painted bows of the ships (배전), creating a scene worth seeing (景色 볼 만 하엿고). On the iron bridge spanning this water, the sound of train wheels occasionally broke the night's silence (夜寂). The thought also occurred that if I took a boat from this river or boarded that train going over there, no matter how many transfers or how many days it took, I could somehow reach my beloved hometown. It must be quite far from here. Since we are in the central part of the Balkan Peninsula, how long must this journey be, and the hardships are beyond mention. The people who saw this actual scene (實景) and had these thoughts this night were not unusual. It had been over a month since leaving Germany, and there wasn't a day without southern boats or northern trains (南船北車), nor a time when I didn't try to manage difficulties through a third language (第三國語). Wherever I went, customs were peculiar (殊異), and though there were no inconveniences with food and lodging, going from this country to that country, and from that country to this country, the language was different each time. Sometimes this third language worked, and other times that third language didn't, should this be called an inconvenience? There were no particularly outstanding inconveniences. However, it became tedious and tiring. According to the planned schedule, visiting just two more new countries would suffice. Seeing this night view <51>, my companion Mr. Kim (金兄) didn't know when to leave. I suggested we go, thinking about waking up early tomorrow. He seemed hesitant, as if he had forgotten about leaving, and appeared somewhat annoyed by my urging.

Budapest, Feeling Like Europe Again
I don't know how vast the 700-ri Liaodong (療東) plain looks or how large the Gimje Mangyeong (金堤萬頃) plain is, but the Balkan plain is also known throughout Europe for being considerably large. We traveled across this vast plain from noon until evening, and even after night fell and we reached Budapest (뿌다페스트), the capital of Hungary (匃牙利國), there was no end in sight. On this wide plain, spring plowing (春耕) was in full swing, with pairs of white oxen hitched to plows (쟁긔). It seemed to be the busy season for farmers (農家). They must be busy irrigating this paddy and plowing that one, with no time to catch their breath (눈코 뜰새가 업슬 것이다). Many paddy fields were also visible on this wide plain, and the thought occurred, what is all the rice grown on this plain used for? Arriving late at night in Budapest, finding an inn took a little effort, if you could call it that. It couldn't really be called hardship. Sitting in a two-horse carriage (쌍두마차) and going here and there, what kind of suffering could that be? After sleeping well that night, the first task wherever I went was exchanging money, so I went out to exchange money. Budapest's population is 1.2 million, enough to function as a considerable city. Not only is the population this large, but looking at the city streets, it is a grand metropolis. Coming here felt like seeing a Central European city again. Compared to German cities, it wouldn't be inferior in the slightest. The Danube River flows through the city center; on the right bank, the former Royal Palace stands tall on a hill, and climbing that hill allows a panoramic view (總覽) of the entire scene. On the left riverbank, the Parliament building draws the eye (人目); it is said to be modeled after the British Parliament. It is magnificently well-built. The excellent location of the Royal Palace and the grandeur of the Parliament building are the best I've seen among European countries.<52> Several iron bridges span the Danube River, but among them, the Elisabeth Bridge (엘리사베드橋) is sturdily well-built, very large, and quite beautiful to look at. Possessing such things, what inadequacy could there be in playing the role of a nation among the European powers (歐羅巴列國)? The cafes on the left bank are also well-made. Anyone with even the price of a cup of coffee in their pocket couldn't just pass by. Music pleases the ear, the river view (江色) delights the eye, and beer and coffee are sold to whet the appetite; could such a fine place be common? Boating on the river (江上船遊) in spring must be tasteful (滋味잇슬 것이며), and moon viewing on the bridge (橋上觀月) on an autumn night must also be refreshing (亦 상쾌할 것이다). I briefly thought of Kyŏngsŏng. To go from within the city walls to the Han River iron bridge for boating or moon viewing, one first gets covered in dust, then bothered by flies, and all one sees coming back are dense thickets on the sandy riverbank or thatched houses like crab shells. This is an incomparable difference (差等) to the banks of the Danube. The citizens of Budapest (뿌府) engage in boating and moon viewing very comfortably, without getting covered in dust or bothered by flies.
At first glance, many Hungarians (匃牙利人) resemble Mongolian peoples (蒙古人種), and although they call themselves Mongolian peoples, pure Mongolians seem few, having become a mixed race (혼혈족) through intermarriage with other ethnic groups (異族相婚), a characteristic of Europeans. Hungarians must be number one when it comes to eating a lot of red pepper powder (고초가루). There's no food without red pepper powder, and among them, 'goulash' (꿀라), made with lots of red pepper powder, is famous for being delicious.

Vienna, Famous in History
Late at night, we arrived in Vienna (維也納), the capital of Austria (墺地利國). Friends Yi (李) and Kim (金) came out to the station to meet us and even arranged an inn, so there was no inconvenience at all. During my five-day stay, I troubled these two gentlemen (兩兄) excessively.<53> Until the end of the Great War, Austria also played a significant role (한목을 보앗지마는) in Europe, but once the Great War ended, the Austro-Hungarian Empire (墺地利匃牙利제국) collapsed like a mud wall in May or June. This territory became independent, that territory became independent, this country took a piece from the south, and that country took a piece from the east. Now, where has the former prosperity gone? It's hardly different from the small, weak Balkan states (빨칸 小弱國). Looking at the current situation, the territory is 84,000 square kilometers (平方米突), which is more than a third of Korea (朝鮮), and the population is 6.5 million, less than half of Korea's. Vienna has a population of 1.84 million, about one-third of the total population. Vienna's city streets are old-fashioned, not modern like German cities. Except for the street in front of the university and 2 or 3 other places, there are no trees on the roads, the layout lacks order (규율이 째히지 못하얏스며), and the buildings look old and shabby (허수하게). The university is also worn out (날것스며), similar to Berlin University. The park in the city center is well-made, and there's even evening music (夜間秦樂). After suffering from the heat during the long summer days, taking a walk in the park at night, sitting under the trees eating ice cream, and listening to that melodious music (嚠喨한 음악) - how cool and refreshing is that? The ancients referred to such things as ten thousand measures of coolness (萬斛의 凉味), but perhaps the coolness we experienced could be exaggerated beyond ten thousand measures to a hundred million measures (億斛의 凉味). Most major theaters are closed for the summer (夏期休業), and even the largest church in Vienna (雜也納 - likely typo for 維也納) is not particularly large compared to those seen in Italy.
The Prater (푸라토어) amusement park is quite well-made. You can have fun there in various tasteful ways: there are small-scale theaters, rides that go up, rides that spin around, games where you pay a small amount and might win a large prize if lucky, and 2 or 3 restaurants with women's orchestras (婦人奏樂) that are always full. People gather in clusters here and there, and it gets quite crowded at night. However, compared to Lunapark (루나팕) in Berlin, the decorations are inferior, and all the setups are far less impressive (어림업슬 것이다). The nighttime fountain show (夜間噴水), held three times a week, uses electric lights to change colors moment by moment, and people stop in their tracks in the plaza (廣庭) to watch it. The Schönbrunn Palace (숀부른) is beautifully decorated. In German terms, it's like the Sanssouci Palace (쌍수씨 宮城) in Potsdam (폿스담); that place was where Frederick the Great (푸리드릭大王) resided, and this place is where Maria Theresa, who was a central figure in 18th-century European politics, followed by Emperor Franz Joseph (푸란쓰요세프帝) who fought the Great War, resided. The interior decorations offer nothing particularly outstanding compared to other palaces, but among them, one room, said to have been made by Maria Theresa at the cost of one million guilders (和蘭貨 - Dutch currency), seems worth that much.<54> This room was made by calling Dutchmen, using precious wood (高貴한 木材) and decorating with gold leaf (금전); it is luxurious to the extreme. The garden is certainly smaller compared to Sanssouci but looks very similar (방불해), and taking a walk at sunset is quite pleasant. Going for a walk to Kahlenberg (코벤쓸) on a Sunday afternoon is also quite tasteful. Rather than a walk, it's about sitting in a cafe on the mountaintop, drinking coffee, and viewing the distant scenery. You take a city tram to the foot of the mountain, and from there, cars go up. Tar oil (타마油) is applied to the road, so there's no reason for dust to fly. Although the mountain is only about one-third the height of Kyŏngsŏng's Namsan (南山), the forest (樹林) is filled with a forest of people (人林), cars are lined up densely (줍대여) on the mountain, every cafe is full, and especially in well-located spots, plazas are set up where it's difficult to find a seat. It seems like everyone from Vienna came here that afternoon. Last autumn, seeing the Sunday afternoon crowd in the capital of Sweden, I was surprised by how many people were out; this afternoon seemed no less crowded. If, as King Frederick of Prussia (普魯西國 푸리드릭대왕) said, humans are born to work is accurate (的確하다), how welcome and joyful must the single Sunday be for them?
Vienna probably has nothing particularly noteworthy in terms of scenery, historical sites, or art. Of course, even if there is some scenery, it cannot compare to Switzerland (瑞西) or Sweden; even if there are some historical sites, they cannot compare to Italy or Germany; and even if there is some art, it still cannot compare to Italy or France (佛蘭西). Besides that, looking at its region, population, or industry, there is nothing outstanding compared to the major powers of Europe and America (歐米有數列國), except perhaps its reputation as a center of fashion trends (流行製出地) and the fame of Viennese beauties (維也納美人). That is the present, but thinking about the past, it must have been completely different from today's Vienna. Before the 18th century AD, European states were immature (未熟品), thus international relations among European nations were not very complex (錯雜지 안엇고), and consequently, domestically and externally, difficult problems like today's were extremely few. Although Paris was called the center of the European diplomatic world at this time, it was very rudimentary (幼稚하엿든 것이다). However, entering the 18th century, as European states matured, the central power of the diplomatic world shifted from Paris to Vienna. Looking at the mid-18th century European diplomatic world, which used intrigue and stratagems (권모술수) as diplomatic tactics, three lines—Paris, St. Petersburg (聖彼得保), Berlin—were tied to Vienna as the center, and besides these, there was a London line, but it was insignificant (미미하얏든 것이다). The European situation developed like this, and European states gradually matured. Although there was the hindrance of Napoleon I (나폴레온 1세), it was for a very short period. During this brief time, Napoleon I spread out the map <55> and arbitrarily changed the colors, temporarily ignoring the traditional relations or national sentiments of European nations and throwing the entire European continent into chaos. However, the European Coalition's War of Liberation (歐洲列國聯合自由戰爭) in 1813 led to the Congress of Vienna (維也納公會) in 1815, which aimed to remodel Napoleon I's arrangements but ended up doing things no different (小毫도 다르지 안케) from what Napoleon I had done. Marking this period as a boundary, European states definitively matured. Around this time, democratic ideas expanded, and rulers adopted suppression as their only good policy (良策). From this, small nations attached to powerful states began independence movements, and the powerful states used all kinds of tyranny (暴虐) to suppress them, yet the words "justice" (正義) and "humanity" (人道) were not produced (製出하지 안엇다). After the Congress of Vienna, the center of the diplomatic world left Vienna but couldn't find a fixed place, seeming to go to London, or perhaps St. Petersburg, or maybe Berlin, but it never found a permanent base. From then on, the nations adopted enriching the country and strengthening the military (부국강병) as their national policy (國是); was this necessarily only Germany? Britain did so, France did so, Russia did so, and other smaller nations did so as well. From this, the Six Great Powers or Seven Great Powers emerged, the European diplomatic world became extremely chaotic (錯亂하게), and the rulers of European nations had no day without hearing new reports (新消息). An autumn wind began to blow in Vienna, which had been the center of the diplomatic world.

Prague, Home to Germany's Oldest University
The Kingdom of Bohemia (뽀헤미아 왕국), which had been attached to the Habsburg family (합스부륵家) of Austria for 400 years, gained independence after the Great War. After the Great War began, Bohemians participated in the war, trained soldiers (養兵) in Siberia (西伯利亞), and established a provisional government (假政府) in Paris, it is said. After the Great War ended and it became a republic, the country name became Czechoslovakia (첵크슬로바키아). The capital, Prague (푸락), has a population of 220,000. The university founded here in 1348 AD by the German Emperor Charles IV (칼4세) is said to be the precursor (嚆矢) of German universities. Besides that, there is a Czechoslovak university, but externally (外樣), neither university looks impressive. The city streets are old-fashioned like Vienna, unclean, and only the street in front of the museum is well-done. The museum's mineral specimen exhibition hall (礦物표본진열관) has gathered quite a collection. Though this isn't *the* mineral specimen exhibition hall, the abundance of types and quantity is the first I've seen like it in Europe. The parliament building on the bank of the Vltava River (몰다우 강변 - Moldau is the German name) is nothing compared to Hungary's and looks like a private house (一私家). As seen in old European cities, there are many narrow, winding alleys (새 골목) with low 2-3 story houses; until these are torn down and rebuilt (更築),<56> a new cityscape will be hard to see. The people here, like Austrians, start their amusement (유흥) around 11 PM, and it doesn't end until 4 AM. Because of this, I couldn't get proper sleep (숙면) for two nights. Here, unless it's a very small inn, it seems they all have a small dance hall (무도장). You wouldn't see such things in Germany. There, 1 AM is the police closing time (警察시간), so you can't stay out later. Here too, the police time is said to be until 4 AM, but this is too late. The people here resemble Poles (波蘭人) and look different from Germans at first glance; their complexion is yellowish (누르며), and their hair appears close to black (흑색에 갓가워). After three days, I left Prague. Not long after, maybe a few hours, I entered the German border, saw the Elbe River (엘베江) and Saxon Switzerland (色遜國 瑞西) from the side (石便 - likely means 'passing by' or 'alongside'), and arrived in Dresden (뜨레스덴). Saxon Switzerland (色遜國 瑞西) got its name because its scenery is said to be like Switzerland (瑞西國). Last early summer, I toured Saxon Switzerland and took a boat down the Elbe River to Dresden. At that time, I thought the scenery was very fine, but after seeing the real Switzerland, the 'pseudo-Switzerland' (假字瑞西) cannot compare. However, a city as refined (精하고) and urbanely arranged (도시다읍게 끰여 노흔) as Dresden would be rare in Europe. Perhaps there are some in the Nordic countries, but they wouldn't be found in Southern Europe or the Balkan Peninsula. Not only that, but even among German cities, there wouldn't be many places like this. From Dresden to Berlin seemed to pass in an instant (순식간). Perhaps it felt that way because I arrived after nearly two months of southern boats and northern trains, but it didn't feel like coming to Berlin; it felt like coming to Kyŏngsŏng.

Nine Countries in Fifty Days
Leaving Berlin on April 9th, crossing the border southwest, seeing 3 cities in Switzerland (瑞西國), then heading south again to Italy, seeing 7 cities, taking a ship from the southern tip of Italy further south, rounding the Greek peninsula and heading slightly north to land in Greece, seeing 2 cities, then taking a ship again slightly northeast to land in Turkey, seeing 1 city, then heading northwest, seeing 1 city each in Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Hungary, from there heading west to Austria and north to Czechoslovakia, seeing 1 city each, crossing the German southeastern border, turning slightly east, and arriving back at the station I departed from on May 27th. This duration is 50 days minus 1 day, the number of countries visited is nine. With this amount of time and travel expenses, it would be sufficient to leave Berlin, pass through Switzerland, take a ship from Marseilles (馬耳塞港) in France, cross the Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean (인도양), land at Moji (門司) in Japan (日本), and return home. Counting the industrial countries in Europe, they would be Germany and Britain. Before the war, Austria was a quasi-industrial country (準工業國), but as a result of its territory being fragmented (四分五裂) after the war,<57> even that could not be maintained. Besides these two industrial nations, almost all others seem to be agricultural or commercial countries. For example, Switzerland and Italy are agricultural/commercial nations, not industrial ones. The Balkan Peninsula nations are all agricultural nations; not a single large factory catches the eye, and they seem purely reliant on their regions, planting grains (五穀) and raising livestock (가축) as their means of living (生活之方). There wasn't a time I didn't see herds of cattle and sheep (牛羊) on any plain or empty mountain slope (빈양). This is not just true for Southern Europe or the Balkan nations; the Nordic nations, which are also not industrial countries, are the same.
In terms of city facilities, few countries can match Germany. Since I haven't seen Russia, Spain (西班牙), Portugal (葡萄牙), or Britain, I cannot definitively state that those four countries also fall short of Germany. However, though I don't know for sure, saying that the three countries besides Britain cannot match Germany would probably not be too much of an erroneous assessment (誤評). In fact, it's said that even Britain cannot match Germany, but I still lack the courage to make a definitive judgment. Among European nations, whether it's the capital or 2-3 major cities, there are countries with cities similar to German cities. But a country where, like Germany, going from City A to City B, or from City B to City C, reveals uniformly equipped facilities is, as mentioned above, extremely rare. In terms of prices, among the European nations I know, Germany seems to have the highest inflation (高騰). Towards foreigners, they generally appear friendly (親功해 보히며), and trying to charge more money is also generally not apparent, but among them, Italy and the Balkan Peninsula nations seem particularly prone to it (尤甚). It goes without saying that foreigners are extremely numerous in Italy and the Balkan Peninsula nations, but Germans are also numerous, no less than British or Americans. As for Koreans (朝鮮사람), besides myself and my companion Mr. Kim, there were none. I tried to find fellow countrymen (在留同胞) in Rome, but it ended in vain (허사). Looking at the prevalence of English, German, and French (英獨佛 삼국어), in Northern Europe, the order is English, then German; in Southern Europe and the Balkan nations, the order is French, then English. Generally speaking, English seems to have the appearance of a world language (세계어의 觀). (August 1st)<58>

**Summary**

This travelogue by Pak Sŭngch'ŏl, published in 1924, recounts a fifty-day journey through nine European countries: Switzerland, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Austria, and Czechoslovakia, before returning to Berlin. Pak describes his impressions of each location, focusing on cityscapes, historical sites like the Acropolis and Schönbrunn Palace, local customs (fezzes in Turkey, Orthodox worship, café culture), infrastructure (trains, bridges), economic conditions (poverty, lack of industry in the Balkans, shoe-shiners in Athens), and encounters with people (guides, beggars, fellow travelers). He frequently compares European sights and conditions, often unfavorably, to places in Korea like Kyŏngsŏng and Inch'ŏn, or favorably to the perceived order and development of Germany. The author notes the dirtiness and backwardness in Greece and the Balkans, contrasts Italian art with Greek philosophy, observes the remnants of Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian imperial power, and comments on language barriers and the prevalence of English. Historically, this article offers a valuable perspective from a Korean intellectual during the Japanese colonial period. Pak's observations on European modernity, decline, national characteristics, and the legacies of empires, alongside his constant comparisons to Korea, reveal a consciousness shaped by his own nation's subjugated status, reflecting both admiration for aspects of European development (especially German order) and a critical eye toward poverty, historical ruins, and the complexities of nationalism and power dynamics he witnessed abroad.

A Factual Account of Seeing Greece, Turkey, and Austria
						By Pak Sŭngch'ŏl

The 3,000-Year-Old Ancient Capital, Athens
Don't even mention how dirty Piraeus (피로이스) Port is. It's not that there aren't clean places with white sand and blue seas if you go to the coast over there, but how is it that the city streets are neck and neck with Shanghai (上海) or Hong Kong (香港)? Inch'ŏn (인천) port is not far from Kyŏngsŏng (京城), so one can't know how much cleaner it is than this. How can I, who haven't seen Inch'ŏn, make that comparison? It's also ridiculous that I, born and raised in Kyŏngsŏng, am talking about Greece without having seen Inch'ŏn. Through the arrangement of a guide, I arrived in Athens (雅典) in about twenty minutes by tram, but inns were full everywhere, and only first-class inns remained. However, I couldn't sleep outdoors. After spending two nights, I moved to another inn. That night, I received a visit from bedbugs. Not only here, but I also saw bedbugs in restaurants. Having traveled through various European countries, this is the first time I've seen bedbugs. Don't even mention the red mountains and dust of Italy. Athens city itself is surrounded by mountains on three sides, but it's just rocks and soil; even if you strain your eyes, you can't see a single blade of grass, there isn't a single tree by the roadside, and dust rises from the sandy ground making it impossible to open your eyes. Just one outing makes your shoes look like they fell into a flour sack. Because of this, the shoe-shining business is worth doing. On every corner, in every alley, there are people shining shoes; not only are these numerous, but movie theaters and cafes also seem quite plentiful. As for cafes, half are indoors and half have chairs placed on the thoroughfare where people sit, smoke water pipes (水烟筒), and drink coffee, but you couldn't imagine how much cold water they drink. This cafe system seems to be the same in all European countries except Germany. It's no wonder they drink so much cold water. Although it was early May, the heat was no different from mid-summer.

Greeks, like Italians, are short, their faces are not very white,<44> and their hair is black. If you want to see tall stature and white faces, you should go to Sweden (瑞典) or Norway (諾威). Don't even mention how good the physique of both men and women is there. Seeing this, perhaps southern peoples are short and brown-faced. The streets of Athens, where such people live, are not very impressive, and there is nothing but the Acropolis (아크로폴릐스) ruins. Who doesn't know that ancient Greek civilization shone brightly? However, this is not as good as the present shining, and the prosperity of former days is not as good as the prosperity of today. Greece, having fallen from this principle, is worse than the backward nations, which needs no further mention. Even if the fountainhead of European civilization lies in Greece, today Greece must learn from the backward nations. Combining Athens and Piraeus, the population is only 240,000, and the goods displayed in the market or the way they are bought and sold are just like what one sees at Kyŏngsŏng's Namdaemun Market. Though small, the University, library, and Academy, which are well adorned with colorful paintwork (丹靑), are gathered in one place, which must be convenient. The National Museum is just a small building containing ancient pottery and human statues, and besides that, only tin utensils. Compared to the various museums in Italy, these are not even worth discussing.

Let's seek out the Acropolis, a relic from the legendary era over thirty centuries ago. Built on a low mountain with marble, after braving wind and rain (櫛風沐雨) for thirty centuries, only the marble pillars, walls, and stairs remain, so the former appearance cannot be seen again. It only greets tens of thousands upon tens of thousands of people from all corners of the world, with different faces and different languages, 365 days a year. According to legend, it was a royal palace, and the marble gate next to it is said to have been built after the Persian War around the 5th century BC, and the gate at Unter den Linden (운터덴린덴) in Berlin (伯林) is said to be modeled after it. Also, next to it, there is a marble statue of the Greek goddess Athena; she held a spear in her left hand, and the tip of the spear was coated with gold, so on a fine day, the gold would glitter in the sunlight, and from this <45> the city name Athens (雅典) is said to have originated, but it cannot be seen now. Although it is said that Greece is not inferior to Italy in terms of marble production, where did they bring all that large marble from, and the stonework (治石) is also done so well. It seems that the marble buildings seen in various parts of Italy were learned from Greece. One should not only admire the grand and exquisite marble buildings in Italy but should admire the Acropolis, which is older than Rome (羅馬), even more. The Greeks of over 3,000 years ago created such architecture that could astonish modern people 3,000 years later; one can know how brightly that civilization shone at that time. The stadium, with seats made of marble for over ten thousand people, is well-made. It is said that ancient people also gave speeches here.

If Italians are the people of art, Greeks could be called the people of philosophy. In various places in Italy, I always heard music. On the streets, in cafes, in inns, in restaurants, there was rarely a time when I didn't hear music. Even if there wasn't a permanent orchestra, there were bands that went around this restaurant and that cafe, playing music and collecting small change (分錢) from the customers. But this cannot be seen in Greece. If Greeks are indeed the people of philosophy, then contemplation must be their primary hobby, and sitting quietly in silent thought (靜坐黙想) must hold infinite interest for them. Don't even mention how many beggars there are in Italy. In Greece, there are so many that one could call it uncountable (不可勝數). While staying in Athens for a week waiting for a ship, I faced great hardship (大困境) due to the heat during the day and bedbugs at night. It's no wonder that inns in Athens are always full. This place has truly become a crossroads for those coming from Italy, Turkey (土耳其), and other Balkan Peninsula (빨칸半島) nations; the number of foreigners seems quite large even at a glance.

Two Fedora Hats Among the Fezzes
Leaving hot and bedbug-ridden Athens, taking a ship from Piraeus and departing the continent felt refreshing, and heading towards the eastern end of Europe (歐羅巴) to see strange customs and manners (奇風異習) was also delightful. This sea voyage was shorter than the previous one and as calm as sitting in a room. Islands were scattered closely on both sides, or else we traveled right along the coast, making it seem like one could reach out and grab tree branches. As we got closer to Turkey, the number of cannon batteries (砲臺) installed along the coasts of both Greece and Turkey looked frighteningly numerous. Modern people call this national defense (國防). Arriving at Constantinople (君士坦堡) Port, the pier was already covered in red fezzes (赤帽). I entrusted myself to a red-fezzed guide to handle immigration procedures, baggage inspection, and even finding an inn.<46> Fortunately, the guide knew English, and the inn knew German, so from then on, there was no difficulty due to language barriers.

Sometimes when entering shops or restaurants, only French is understood, but compared to Athens, the fact that German is more widely understood might be a trace of the former German Empire's "3B Policy" (三B정책). Constantinople was the former capital of the Ottoman Empire (土耳其帝國), but since becoming a republic, Angora (안고라) is the capital. The former might of the Ottoman Empire goes without saying, but since the early 19th century, the European powers openly and fiercely plotted to occupy Constantinople. However, it wasn't that Turkey had the strength to prevent it, but rather it stemmed from the idea that since neither I nor you can have it, it's better policy (良策) to let Turkey preserve it. Russia (露國) established it as a national policy, thinking it advantageous to seize Constantinople (君府) to break out of the Black Sea (黑海) and advance onto the world stage. Even the Russian Empire (露帝國) that held such a national policy has collapsed, and the Ottoman Empire, like meat on a chopping block (俎上肉塊), has also fallen apart. How can we, looking at Constantinople, not feel the passage of time (今昔之感)?

The streets of Constantinople, with a population of over 1.05 million (`일백오천여만` likely means 1,050,000+), are reasonably well-made, but large buildings are not visible. In the city center, a large iron bridge spans across; it was constructed by Germans, a toll is collected for passage, and underneath it connects the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. The uncleanliness of the streets is the same as Athens, and the peddlers (呼賣商) are just like in Venice (베늬쓰). If you go behind the main streets, there are wooden storied houses (木製層屋). Seeing this reminded me of life in Tokyo (東京). Not only are there wooden storied houses, but like German cities, there are also areas where residences are neither too high nor too low (不高不卑) and neatly arranged. However, generally, it seems inferior to Germany. In this large city, there isn't a single factory, so the number of unemployed is beyond imagination, and anyone can see unemployed men wearing fezzes standing on street corners looking for meager earnings (버리자리).<47> Adults wear fezzes, children wear fezzes, everyone wears fezzes. Only newly arrived foreigners don't wear fezzes; foreigners who have stayed even a little while also wear fezzes. When you go out on the street, you can immediately tell if someone is a foreigner or a local. You can tell by the hat; wherever we looked, the two of us were two fedora hats (中折帽) among the fezzes. The custom of women covering their faces with black cloth (黑褓) when going out, and washing their faces, hands, and feet in the mosque (回回敎堂) and bowing hundreds and thousands of times during worship is also a unique custom. The Hagia Sophia (쏘피아 교당) is said to be the largest among them. This mosque was first built by the Byzantines (삐싼틘人) and worshipped many gods; then, during the Eastern Roman Empire, it became a Christian church (耶蘇敎교당); and after that, it became a mosque. At the southern end of the mosque, there is a hole in a marble pillar; if you put your finger in the hole and turn it, tears come out, and this is said to be the tears of Jesus. This story was made up due to the discord between Muslims (回回敎徒) and Christians (예수교도). Besides that, on the upper part of the central support pillar (車便중간기동 - exact meaning unclear, interpreted as central pillar), there is a mark said to be a footprint (솊�자족 - likely footprint); this is said to be the footprint of Mehmet II (모하메트 2세) from 1453 AD. This also doesn't sound plausible. How could a hand reach the top, over two spans high, even if on horseback, and it's unthinkable that a footprint would remain after 500 years. Inside this mosque too, there is a large water container (水桶) filled with water for washing face, hands, and feet.

Byzantine Era Reservoir and Recreation Area
When Constantinople was in the hands of the Byzantines (삐싼틘人), they, concerned about emergencies, dug the ground and made a reservoir. It is said that later people didn't know about it and discovered it recently. Even now, if you go inside, water is deeply pooled in a place about two spans deep. Relics from the Byzantine era are not limited to this. There is a market similar to Kyŏngsŏng's licensed stores (京城立廛); if you go inside, it's dim even in broad daylight (白晝), making it difficult to quickly recognize goods. There are all sorts of miscellaneous goods (萬種雜貨), gold, silver, jewels (金銀珠玉), silks and brocades (綾羅錦繡), and even restaurants, but selling goods while sitting in these shops (廛房) is no different from Kyŏngsŏng's licensed stores. They sit on cushions spread on the floor and persistently ask foreigners to buy things. The haggling over prices is extreme. The guide said this: If a merchant asks for 100, offer only one. Besides this, there are things from the Turkish era. Everywhere, the sound of people clamoring (와글와글) can be heard. The Sweet Waters recreation area (甘水유흥지) seems to be about 20 ri (approx. 8 km) from Constantinople. On Fridays, the Muslim holiday, the hills and fields are said to form a sea of people (人山人海). To my eyes, it doesn't seem like a particularly good place. There are low mountains on the left and right, and in the center, a small stream flows into the Black Sea. This stream doesn't look clean, nor does the water seem sweet. However, the Turkish people call this place <48> the Sweet Waters recreation area, and women prepare food in baskets (보통이), come here, and spend a day relaxing (消暢) on the grass. It is said that on Fridays, all sorts of spectacles gather here, and all kinds of food stalls assemble, making the day's pleasure (歡樂) hard to imagine. On this day too, groups of people were gathered here and there, sitting, drinking, and eating. Near this recreation area, there is a girls' orphanage; thanks to the principal's special kindness (好竟), I was able to tour the school thoroughly (縱覽). This school is said to accommodate daughters of those who died during the European Great War (歐洲大戰時) and the recent Greco-Turkish War (希土戰爭時). A female teacher was specially assigned to show everything. Classrooms, workshops, dining hall, dormitory, and everything else were shown without missing a single thing. Modeled after those in recently advanced countries, how could any of it be ordinary (凡然)? It's said they teach various handicrafts (手工) and other household skills (살림살이) as part of the school curriculum. At that time, the female teacher gave detailed explanations, and upon seeing her once, her character seemed remarkably gentle. It seemed rare to see such a distinct and womanly woman. What great fortune it must be for those black-haired, yellow-faced (黑髮黃顔) young girls to have such a female teacher in such a well-equipped place. Generally, Turkish people resemble us, and the women especially look similar to Korean women (朝鮮婦女). Lastly, let me note that Turkey has beautiful scenery (物色) and is a prohibitionist country (禁酒國). Prohibition is so strict that even beer is banned, so restaurants sell beer in coffee cups. The Imperial Palace by the sea is also well-built. The gate is made of marble, and inside that magnificent building, the Sultan who ruled the territory spanning the two continents of Europe and Asia must have resided (起居), but today it stands empty, and the glory (榮華) of former days has vanished.

Paddy Fields and Thatched Houses Along the Railway
From Constantinople to Sofia (쏘퓌아), the capital of Bulgaria (뿔가리아國), takes about 30 hours by train; this is because it's an express train. If it were an ordinary train, one couldn't know how much longer it would take. In general, the slowness of trains in the Balkan Peninsula nations (빨칸반도列國) is well-known (有所聞). The so-called express train stops at every station, making it indistinguishable from an ordinary train. There is nothing worth seeing along the sides, left and right, and no signs of human cultivation (人工) are visible in the mountains and fields. In other places, one would expect to see large cities or signs of cultivation in the mountains and fields. However, none of this can be seen in the Balkan Peninsula nations. The Balkan Peninsula nations are still backward (後進), seemingly concentrating all their efforts on building a few cities besides their respective capitals, and the day when they will have spare capacity seems far off. Along the railway, there are only thatched houses (草家) and paddy fields (水田), just like those seen along the Korean railways (朝鮮鐵道沿邊). Thatched houses are most numerous within Turkish territory (土耳其 境內). Last January, when I went to Poland (波蘭),<49> I saw thatched houses and called it a rare sight in the European world (歐羅巴 天地). Today, seeing thatched houses in the Balkan Peninsula nations, I realized that not all of Europe is like Germany. It's not that Germany doesn't have thatched houses. I saw them last year on the way to the Nordic countries (北歐列國). However, those were thatched houses in name only; they were storied houses built with brick walls and decorated to the fullest extent. The thatched houses seen elsewhere were truly thatched houses. Built with mud walls packed little by little (족음 족음), they looked like overturned crab shells (게딱지). The inspection at the border is excessively strict. It seems the smaller the country (小國), the stricter these things are. Entering Bulgarian territory, I saw snowy scenery (雪景) again after a month. Having suffered from the heat, seeing this cool sight refreshed my spirits.

Sofia has a population of only 100,000, and rather than saying the city streets are unimpressive, they are still underdeveloped (들되엿다). In front of the station, there are many vacant lots (뷔인터), and it seems like there might be some plans. The Greek Orthodox Church (希臘正敎堂), built in the late 19th century, is not very large but worth seeing once and resembles the churches seen in Rome. The park in the city center is only about the size of Kyŏngsŏng's Pagoda Park (京城 빠고다 공원), but that small place is so packed with people that it's hard to get a chair (交椅). The former Royal Palace is quite well-built, but the university is unimpressive. How substantial could its content be when even its external appearance (外形) doesn't look satisfactory? The National Museum is just a small building, and the exhibits displayed inside are unimpressive, with only a few types of items. Among them, what catches the eye are two paintings showing how many Bulgarians were massacred by the Turks; one depicts Turks capturing Bulgarians and gouging out their eyeballs, and the other shows the massacre of the young and weak (幼弱) in front of a crowd (衆人). When we looked at the paintings, our limbs trembled (사지가 떨릴 적에); how much must Bulgarians' blood boil and flesh tremble when they see them? No matter how much I think about it, in human society, the strong preying on the weak is a false way (僞道), yet unknowingly (不知不識間), whether for nations or individuals, the law of the jungle (약육강식) has become the motto of social evolution and human life. People carry various drinks on their backs and sell them on the streets; here too, they wear shoes made from a single piece of leather, wear fur vests (털마고자) and wide trousers (통넓은 바지). Women wear long jackets (긴저고리) and wide skirts (통 넓은 치마) worn by native women, and it is also a strange custom (奇風) for farming women to carry babies wrapped in bundles (보통이) like carrying luggage.

Flooding Throughout the Belgrade Area
Due to the melting snow from the Alps (알푸스山), the Danube River (딴윰江) overflowed, flooding everywhere along the river (沿江), and a flood disaster (물란리) occurred even in Belgrade (뻘그라드), the capital of Yugoslavia (유고슬라비아 국). The train, blocked by water and unable to proceed, waited for three or four hours in the middle for the construction work to finish. The raging waves (怒濤)<50> looked like they could sweep away even Mount Tai (泰山). Refugees lived in tents pitched here and there, and houses (人家) and fields (田土) were submerged in water. In Belgrade too, along the river, it was the same situation; people startled by the water were waiting in warehouse wagons (庫間車) for the water to subside (減水). Belgrade, whether considering the city streets, the former Royal Palace, various government offices, or anything else, appears far superior to Sofia. The street in front of the Royal Palace is ultra-modern. The sidewalks (人道) and roadway (車道) are wide, trams run down the center, various shops line both sides, and though the buildings are not large, they are exquisitely built. The university is divided into two locations, but neither is very large nor particularly refined (精하지도 못하다). The park in front of the station is about the same size as the one in Sofia, and the park on the hill by the Danube riverbank is small but very well situated for viewing the distant scenery (遠景). Belgrade's population is said to be 300,000. In every aspect, it looks larger than Sofia, and the city streets show much imitation of those in advanced countries. The market was crowded with people, and vegetables like garlic (마눌), green onions (파), green peppers (풋고초), young pumpkins (애호박), and eggplants (가지) that I used to see and eat back home were laid out; after coming to the Balkans, I tasted things I hadn't tasted for several years. Taking advantage of Sunday afternoon, I went to see an opera. The theater wasn't very large but quite well-made. Due to their skillful performance, not clumsy, they received praise from the audience, and the male and female lead actors at that time sang well with good voices (목청좃케). At night, I took a walk in the riverside park. It must have been around the full moon (望日) by the lunar calendar. Moonlight filled the mountains and fields (山野), and through the middle flowed the fast-running Danube River. On both banks, in the riverside villages (江村), lingering lamps (殘燈) flickered, and countless steamships floated on the river (江上). As the wind blew and waves crashed, the moonlight reflected on the white-painted bows of the ships (배전), creating a scene worth seeing (景色 볼 만 하엿고). On the iron bridge spanning this water, the sound of train wheels occasionally broke the night's silence (夜寂). The thought also occurred that if I took a boat from this river or boarded that train going over there, no matter how many transfers or how many days it took, I could somehow reach my beloved hometown. It must be quite far from here. Since we are in the central part of the Balkan Peninsula, how long must this journey be, and the hardships are beyond mention. The people who saw this actual scene (實景) and had these thoughts this night were not unusual. It had been over a month since leaving Germany, and there wasn't a day without southern boats or northern trains (南船北車), nor a time when I didn't try to manage difficulties through a third language (第三國語). Wherever I went, customs were peculiar (殊異), and though there were no inconveniences with food and lodging, going from this country to that country, and from that country to this country, the language was different each time. Sometimes this third language worked, and other times that third language didn't, should this be called an inconvenience? There were no particularly outstanding inconveniences. However, it became tedious and tiring. According to the planned schedule, visiting just two more new countries would suffice. Seeing this night view <51>, my companion Mr. Kim (金兄) didn't know when to leave. I suggested we go, thinking about waking up early tomorrow. He seemed hesitant, as if he had forgotten about leaving, and appeared somewhat annoyed by my urging.

Budapest, Feeling Like Europe Again
I don't know how vast the 700-ri Liaodong (療東) plain looks or how large the Gimje Mangyeong (金堤萬頃) plain is, but the Balkan plain is also known throughout Europe for being considerably large. We traveled across this vast plain from noon until evening, and even after night fell and we reached Budapest (뿌다페스트), the capital of Hungary (匃牙利國), there was no end in sight. On this wide plain, spring plowing (春耕) was in full swing, with pairs of white oxen hitched to plows (쟁긔). It seemed to be the busy season for farmers (農家). They must be busy irrigating this paddy and plowing that one, with no time to catch their breath (눈코 뜰새가 업슬 것이다). Many paddy fields were also visible on this wide plain, and the thought occurred, what is all the rice grown on this plain used for? Arriving late at night in Budapest, finding an inn took a little effort, if you could call it that. It couldn't really be called hardship. Sitting in a two-horse carriage (쌍두마차) and going here and there, what kind of suffering could that be? After sleeping well that night, the first task wherever I went was exchanging money, so I went out to exchange money. Budapest's population is 1.2 million, enough to function as a considerable city. Not only is the population this large, but looking at the city streets, it is a grand metropolis. Coming here felt like seeing a Central European city again. Compared to German cities, it wouldn't be inferior in the slightest. The Danube River flows through the city center; on the right bank, the former Royal Palace stands tall on a hill, and climbing that hill allows a panoramic view (總覽) of the entire scene. On the left riverbank, the Parliament building draws the eye (人目); it is said to be modeled after the British Parliament. It is magnificently well-built. The excellent location of the Royal Palace and the grandeur of the Parliament building are the best I've seen among European countries.<52> Several iron bridges span the Danube River, but among them, the Elisabeth Bridge (엘리사베드橋) is sturdily well-built, very large, and quite beautiful to look at. Possessing such things, what inadequacy could there be in playing the role of a nation among the European powers (歐羅巴列國)? The cafes on the left bank are also well-made. Anyone with even the price of a cup of coffee in their pocket couldn't just pass by. Music pleases the ear, the river view (江色) delights the eye, and beer and coffee are sold to whet the appetite; could such a fine place be common? Boating on the river (江上船遊) in spring must be tasteful (滋味잇슬 것이며), and moon viewing on the bridge (橋上觀月) on an autumn night must also be refreshing (亦 상쾌할 것이다). I briefly thought of Kyŏngsŏng. To go from within the city walls to the Han River iron bridge for boating or moon viewing, one first gets covered in dust, then bothered by flies, and all one sees coming back are dense thickets on the sandy riverbank or thatched houses like crab shells. This is an incomparable difference (差等) to the banks of the Danube. The citizens of Budapest (뿌府) engage in boating and moon viewing very comfortably, without getting covered in dust or bothered by flies.

At first glance, many Hungarians (匃牙利人) resemble Mongolian peoples (蒙古人種), and although they call themselves Mongolian peoples, pure Mongolians seem few, having become a mixed race (혼혈족) through intermarriage with other ethnic groups (異族相婚), a characteristic of Europeans. Hungarians must be number one when it comes to eating a lot of red pepper powder (고초가루). There's no food without red pepper powder, and among them, 'goulash' (꿀라), made with lots of red pepper powder, is famous for being delicious.

Vienna, Famous in History
Late at night, we arrived in Vienna (維也納), the capital of Austria (墺地利國). Friends Yi (李) and Kim (金) came out to the station to meet us and even arranged an inn, so there was no inconvenience at all. During my five-day stay, I troubled these two gentlemen (兩兄) excessively.<53> Until the end of the Great War, Austria also played a significant role (한목을 보앗지마는) in Europe, but once the Great War ended, the Austro-Hungarian Empire (墺地利匃牙利제국) collapsed like a mud wall in May or June. This territory became independent, that territory became independent, this country took a piece from the south, and that country took a piece from the east. Now, where has the former prosperity gone? It's hardly different from the small, weak Balkan states (빨칸 小弱國). Looking at the current situation, the territory is 84,000 square kilometers (平方米突), which is more than a third of Korea (朝鮮), and the population is 6.5 million, less than half of Korea's. Vienna has a population of 1.84 million, about one-third of the total population. Vienna's city streets are old-fashioned, not modern like German cities. Except for the street in front of the university and 2 or 3 other places, there are no trees on the roads, the layout lacks order (규율이 째히지 못하얏스며), and the buildings look old and shabby (허수하게). The university is also worn out (날것스며), similar to Berlin University. The park in the city center is well-made, and there's even evening music (夜間秦樂). After suffering from the heat during the long summer days, taking a walk in the park at night, sitting under the trees eating ice cream, and listening to that melodious music (嚠喨한 음악) - how cool and refreshing is that? The ancients referred to such things as ten thousand measures of coolness (萬斛의 凉味), but perhaps the coolness we experienced could be exaggerated beyond ten thousand measures to a hundred million measures (億斛의 凉味). Most major theaters are closed for the summer (夏期休業), and even the largest church in Vienna (維也納) is not particularly large compared to those seen in Italy.

The Prater (푸라토어) amusement park is quite well-made. You can have fun there in various tasteful ways: there are small-scale theaters, rides that go up, rides that spin around, games where you pay a small amount and might win a large prize if lucky, and 2 or 3 restaurants with women's orchestras (婦人奏樂) that are always full. People gather in clusters here and there, and it gets quite crowded at night. However, compared to Lunapark (루나팕) in Berlin, the decorations are inferior, and all the setups are far less impressive (어림업슬 것이다). The nighttime fountain show (夜間噴水), held three times a week, uses electric lights to change colors moment by moment, and people stop in their tracks in the plaza (廣庭) to watch it. The Schönbrunn Palace (숀부른) is beautifully decorated. In German terms, it's like the Sanssouci Palace (쌍수씨 宮城) in Potsdam (폿스담); that place was where Frederick the Great (푸리드릭大王) resided, and this place is where Maria Theresa, who was a central figure in 18th-century European politics, followed by Emperor Franz Joseph (푸란쓰요세프帝) who fought the Great War, resided. The interior decorations offer nothing particularly outstanding compared to other palaces, but among them, one room, said to have been made by Maria Theresa at the cost of one million guilders (和蘭貨 - Dutch currency), seems worth that much.<54> This room was made by calling Dutchmen, using precious wood (高貴한 木材) and decorating with gold leaf (금전); it is luxurious to the extreme. The garden is certainly smaller compared to Sanssouci but looks very similar (방불해), and taking a walk at sunset is quite pleasant. Going for a walk to Kahlenberg (코벤쓸) on a Sunday afternoon is also quite tasteful. Rather than a walk, it's about sitting in a cafe on the mountaintop, drinking coffee, and viewing the distant scenery. You take a city tram to the foot of the mountain, and from there, cars go up. Tar oil (타마油) is applied to the road, so there's no reason for dust to fly. Although the mountain is only about one-third the height of Kyŏngsŏng's Namsan (南山), the forest (樹林) is filled with a forest of people (人林), cars are lined up densely (줍대여) on the mountain, every cafe is full, and especially in well-located spots, plazas are set up where it's difficult to find a seat. It seems like everyone from Vienna came here that afternoon. Last autumn, seeing the Sunday afternoon crowd in the capital of Sweden, I was surprised by how many people were out; this afternoon seemed no less crowded. If, as King Frederick of Prussia (普魯西國 푸리드릭대왕) said, humans are born to work is accurate (的確하다), how welcome and joyful must the single Sunday be for them?

Vienna probably has nothing particularly noteworthy in terms of scenery, historical sites, or art. Of course, even if there is some scenery, it cannot compare to Switzerland (瑞西) or Sweden; even if there are some historical sites, they cannot compare to Italy or Germany; and even if there is some art, it still cannot compare to Italy or France (佛蘭西). Besides that, looking at its region, population, or industry, there is nothing outstanding compared to the major powers of Europe and America (歐米有數列國), except perhaps its reputation as a center of fashion trends (流行製出地) and the fame of Viennese beauties (維也納美人). That is the present, but thinking about the past, it must have been completely different from today's Vienna. Before the 18th century AD, European states were immature (未熟品), thus international relations among European nations were not very complex (錯雜지 안엇고), and consequently, domestically and externally, difficult problems like today's were extremely few. Although Paris was called the center of the European diplomatic world at this time, it was very rudimentary (幼稚하엿든 것이다). However, entering the 18th century, as European states matured, the central power of the diplomatic world shifted from Paris to Vienna. Looking at the mid-18th century European diplomatic world, which used intrigue and stratagems (권모술수) as diplomatic tactics, three lines—Paris, St. Petersburg (聖彼得保), Berlin—were tied to Vienna as the center, and besides these, there was a London line, but it was insignificant (미미하얏든 것이다). The European situation developed like this, and European states gradually matured. Although there was the hindrance of Napoleon I (나폴레온 1세), it was for a very short period. During this brief time, Napoleon I spread out the map <55> and arbitrarily changed the colors, temporarily ignoring the traditional relations or national sentiments of European nations and throwing the entire European continent into chaos. However, the European Coalition's War of Liberation (歐洲列國聯合自由戰爭) in 1813 led to the Congress of Vienna (維也納公會) in 1815, which aimed to remodel Napoleon I's arrangements but ended up doing things no different (小毫도 다르지 안케) from what Napoleon I had done. Marking this period as a boundary, European states definitively matured. Around this time, democratic ideas expanded, and rulers adopted suppression as their only good policy (良策). From this, small nations attached to powerful states began independence movements, and the powerful states used all kinds of tyranny (暴虐) to suppress them, yet the words "justice" (正義) and "humanity" (人道) were not produced (製出하지 안엇다). After the Congress of Vienna, the center of the diplomatic world left Vienna but couldn't find a fixed place, seeming to go to London, or perhaps St. Petersburg, or maybe Berlin, but it never found a permanent base. From then on, the nations adopted enriching the country and strengthening the military (부국강병) as their national policy (國是); was this necessarily only Germany? Britain did so, France did so, Russia did so, and other smaller nations did so as well. From this, the Six Great Powers or Seven Great Powers emerged, the European diplomatic world became extremely chaotic (錯亂하게), and the rulers of European nations had no day without hearing new reports (新消息). An autumn wind began to blow in Vienna, which had been the center of the diplomatic world.

Prague, Home to Germany's Oldest University
The Kingdom of Bohemia (뽀헤미아 왕국), which had been attached to the Habsburg family (합스부륵家) of Austria for 400 years, gained independence after the Great War. After the Great War began, Bohemians participated in the war, trained soldiers (養兵) in Siberia (西伯利亞), and established a provisional government (假政府) in Paris, it is said. After the Great War ended and it became a republic, the country name became Czechoslovakia (첵크슬로바키아). The capital, Prague (푸락), has a population of 220,000. The university founded here in 1348 AD by the German Emperor Charles IV (칼4세) is said to be the precursor (嚆矢) of German universities. Besides that, there is a Czechoslovak university, but externally (外樣), neither university looks impressive. The city streets are old-fashioned like Vienna, unclean, and only the street in front of the museum is well-done. The museum's mineral specimen exhibition hall (礦物표본진열관) has gathered quite a collection. Though this isn't *the* mineral specimen exhibition hall, the abundance of types and quantity is the first I've seen like it in Europe. The parliament building on the bank of the Vltava River (몰다우 강변 - Moldau is the German name) is nothing compared to Hungary's and looks like a private house (一私家). As seen in old European cities, there are many narrow, winding alleys (새 골목) with low 2-3 story houses; until these are torn down and rebuilt (更築),<56> a new cityscape will be hard to see. The people here, like Austrians, start their amusement (유흥) around 11 PM, and it doesn't end until 4 AM. Because of this, I couldn't get proper sleep (숙면) for two nights. Here, unless it's a very small inn, it seems they all have a small dance hall (무도장). You wouldn't see such things in Germany. There, 1 AM is the police closing time (警察시간), so you can't stay out later. Here too, the police time is said to be until 4 AM, but this is too late. The people here resemble Poles (波蘭人) and look different from Germans at first glance; their complexion is yellowish (누르며), and their hair appears close to black (흑색에 갓가워). After three days, I left Prague. Not long after, maybe a few hours, I entered the German border, saw the Elbe River (엘베江) and Saxon Switzerland (色遜國 瑞西) passing by (石便), and arrived in Dresden (뜨레스덴). Saxon Switzerland (色遜國 瑞西) got its name because its scenery is said to be like Switzerland (瑞西國). Last early summer, I toured Saxon Switzerland and took a boat down the Elbe River to Dresden. At that time, I thought the scenery was very fine, but after seeing the real Switzerland, the 'pseudo-Switzerland' (假字瑞西) cannot compare. However, a city as refined (精하고) and urbanely arranged (도시다읍게 끰여 노흔) as Dresden would be rare in Europe. Perhaps there are some in the Nordic countries, but they wouldn't be found in Southern Europe or the Balkan Peninsula. Not only that, but even among German cities, there wouldn't be many places like this. From Dresden to Berlin seemed to pass in an instant (순식간). Perhaps it felt that way because I arrived after nearly two months of southern boats and northern trains, but it didn't feel like coming to Berlin; it felt like coming to Kyŏngsŏng.

Nine Countries in Fifty Days
Leaving Berlin on April 9th, crossing the border southwest, seeing 3 cities in Switzerland (瑞西國), then heading south again to Italy, seeing 7 cities, taking a ship from the southern tip of Italy further south, rounding the Greek peninsula and heading slightly north to land in Greece, seeing 2 cities, then taking a ship again slightly northeast to land in Turkey, seeing 1 city, then heading northwest, seeing 1 city each in Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Hungary, from there heading west to Austria and north to Czechoslovakia, seeing 1 city each, crossing the German southeastern border, turning slightly east, and arriving back at the station I departed from on May 27th. This duration is 50 days minus 1 day, the number of countries visited is nine. With this amount of time and travel expenses, it would be sufficient to leave Berlin, pass through Switzerland, take a ship from Marseilles (馬耳塞港) in France, cross the Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean (인도양), land at Moji (門司) in Japan (日本), and return home. Counting the industrial countries in Europe, they would be Germany and Britain. Before the war, Austria was a quasi-industrial country (準工業國), but as a result of its territory being fragmented (四分五裂) after the war,<57> even that could not be maintained. Besides these two industrial nations, almost all others seem to be agricultural or commercial countries. For example, Switzerland and Italy are agricultural/commercial nations, not industrial ones. The Balkan Peninsula nations are all agricultural nations; not a single large factory catches the eye, and they seem purely reliant on their regions, planting grains (五穀) and raising livestock (가축) as their means of living (生活之方). There wasn't a time I didn't see herds of cattle and sheep (牛羊) on any plain or empty mountain slope (빈양). This is not just true for Southern Europe or the Balkan nations; the Nordic nations, which are also not industrial countries, are the same.

In terms of city facilities, few countries can match Germany. Since I haven't seen Russia, Spain (西班牙), Portugal (葡萄牙), or Britain, I cannot definitively state that those four countries also fall short of Germany. However, though I don't know for sure, saying that the three countries besides Britain cannot match Germany would probably not be too much of an erroneous assessment (誤評). In fact, it's said that even Britain cannot match Germany, but I still lack the courage to make a definitive judgment. Among European nations, whether it's the capital or 2-3 major cities, there are countries with cities similar to German cities. But a country where, like Germany, going from City A to City B, or from City B to City C, reveals uniformly equipped facilities is, as mentioned above, extremely rare. In terms of prices, among the European nations I know, Germany seems to have the highest inflation (高騰). Towards foreigners, they generally appear friendly (親功해 보히며), and trying to charge more money is also generally not apparent, but among them, Italy and the Balkan Peninsula nations seem particularly prone to it (尤甚). It goes without saying that foreigners are extremely numerous in Italy and the Balkan Peninsula nations, but Germans are also numerous, no less than British or Americans. As for Koreans (朝鮮사람), besides myself and my companion Mr. Kim, there were none. I tried to find fellow countrymen (在留同胞) in Rome, but it ended in vain (허사). Looking at the prevalence of English, German, and French (英獨佛 삼국어), in Northern Europe, the order is English, then German; in Southern Europe and the Balkan nations, the order is French, then English. Generally speaking, English seems to have the appearance of a world language (세계어의 觀). (August 1st)<58>

**Summary**

This travelogue by Pak Sŭngch'ŏl, published in 1924, recounts a fifty-day journey through nine European countries: Switzerland, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Austria, and Czechoslovakia, before returning to Berlin. Pak describes his impressions of each location, focusing on cityscapes, historical sites like the Acropolis and Schönbrunn Palace, local customs (fezzes in Turkey, Orthodox worship, café culture), infrastructure (trains, bridges), economic conditions (poverty, lack of industry in the Balkans, shoe-shiners in Athens), and encounters with people (guides, beggars, fellow travelers). He frequently compares European sights and conditions, often unfavorably, to places in Korea like Kyŏngsŏng and Inch'ŏn, or favorably to the perceived order and development of Germany. The author notes the dirtiness and backwardness in Greece and the Balkans, contrasts Italian art with Greek philosophy, observes the remnants of Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian imperial power, and comments on language barriers and the prevalence of English. Historically, this article offers a valuable perspective from a Korean intellectual during the Japanese colonial period. Pak's observations on European modernity, decline, national characteristics, and the legacies of empires, alongside his constant comparisons to Korea, reveal a consciousness shaped by his own nation's subjugated status, reflecting both admiration for aspects of European development (especially German order) and a critical eye toward poverty, historical ruins, and the complexities of nationalism and power dynamics he witnessed abroad.

希臘.土耳其.墺地利를 보던 實記
						朴勝喆
三千餘年의 古都 雅典
피로이스 港의 지저분한 것은 말도 말어라. 저쪽 해안으로 가면 白沙, 靑海에 精한 곳이 업는 것도 안이다 마는 시가지는 엇지면 그러케도 중국 上海나 香港과 伯仲之間이냐. 인천항은 경성서 머지안은 항구이니 이보담 얼마나 精한지 알 수 업다. 인천을 보지 못한 내가 그 비교를 할 수 잇느냐. 生於京城하고 長於京城한 내가 인천을 못보고 希臘國을 이약이 하는 것도 우수운 일이다. 안내인의 주선으로 전차를 타고 약 이십분만에 雅典에 도착하엿지마는 여관은 도처에 만원이요, 남엇다는 것이 일류 여관뿐이다. 그러나 노숙할 수는 업다. 이틀 밤을 지내고 다른 여관으로 옴기엿다. 이날밤에 빈대의 문안을 바덧다. 이 곳 뿐 안이라, 음식점에 가서도 역시 빈대를 보앗다. 歐羅巴 각국을 다녀 보아야 빈대는 이곳서 츠음 본다. 이태리의 赤山과 먼지를 말을 말어라. 雅典市라야 삼면이 산으로 돌려 잇스되 바위와 흙뿐이요, 눈을 씻고 보아도 풀 한 포귀 업스며, 路邊에 나무 하나 업고 모래바닥에선 먼지만 눈을 못뜨게 나니 외출 한 번만 하면 구두는 밀가루 섬에 빠젓든 것갓다. 이로하야 구두닥는 영업이 할 만하다. 어느 모툉이, 어느 골목을 가든지 구두를 닥거주는 사람이요, 이것만 만흔 것이 안이라 활동사진관이며, 카페집도 어지간히 만허 보인다. 카페집이라야 절반은 실내이고 절반은 통행로에다가 交椅를 놋코 그 곳에 안져서 水烟筒도 빨며 카페도 마시지마는 냉수를 만히 마시는 것은 상상치 못하리라. 이러한 카페집 제도는 독일을 除하고는 歐洲 각국이 동일한 것갓다. 그들이 냉수를 만히 마시는 것도 무리는 안이다. 그 때가 오월초순이지마는 더위는 삼복중이나 다를 것업다.
희랍인도 이태리인과 가티 키가 적고 얼골이 그리 희지＜44＞못하며 머리털이 검다. 長軀白顔을 보려면 瑞典이나 諾威로 갈 것이다. 남녀의 체격 조흔 것은 말도 말어라. 이로 보면 남방인은 短軀褐顔이라구나 할가. 이러한 사람들이 사는 雅典市街는 그리 보잘 것 업고, 아크로폴릐스고적 하나 밧게 업다. 往古희랍의 문명이 빗낫든 것은 누가 모르랴, 그러나 이것이 현재에 빗나는 것만 못하고, 前日의 부강이 今日의 부강만 못하니, 이 원칙에 떨어진 희랍이 後進列國보다 못한 것은 더 말할 필요도 업다. 歐洲文明의 淵泉이 희랍에 잇다고 하여도 今日에 至하야는 희랍이 後進列國에게 배워야 하겟다. 雅典과 피로이쓰를 합하여야 인구가 이십사만 밧게 안이되며 시장에 물건이 느러노힌 것이라든지, 그 물건을 매매하는 것이 맛치 京城남대문시장에서 보는 것도 갓다. 적기는 적으나 丹靑을 잘할 大學이며 도서관, 學士院이 한 곳에 모혀 잇스니 서로 편리할 것이다. 국립박물관이라야 조그마한 건축물 속에 古代土器 及 人像이 잇스며 其外에 주석器皿이 잇는 것 밧게 업다. 이러한 것은 이태리 각 박물관에 비하면 문제도 되지 안는다.
삼십여 세기 전 전설시대의 유물인 아크로폴릐쓰나 차저 가보쟈. 나지막한 山上에 대리석으로 지엿스니 櫛風沐雨 삼십여년에 대리석 기둥과 벽이며 층계만 남엇스니 前모양 다시 볼 수 업고, 세계만방에서 차저 오는 얼굴빗이 서로 다르고 말소래가 서로 다른 사람만 일년삼백육십일에 몃만 몃십만을 마질 뿐이다. 전설에 의지하면 王宮이엿고, 그 엽헤 잇는 대리석문은 西曆紀元前 오세기경 波斯戰役이 잇슨 후에 지은 것이라 하며, 이것을 모방하야 伯林 운터덴린덴에 門을 세웟다 한다. 또 그 엽헤 희랍여신 아테네의 대리석상이 잇스며 그 左手에는 槍을 들엇스며 그 창 끗헤는 金을 붓첫스니 일기가 조흔 날이면 日光에 金이 번적거린다고 하며, 이로부터＜45＞ 아텐(雅典)이라는 城名이 생기게 되엿다고 하나 지금은 볼 수 업다. 대리석이 만히 나기로 하면 희랍도 이태리에 못하지 안는다고 하지마는 그 큰 대리석을 다 어대서 가저 왓스며 治石도 잘도 하얏다. 이태리 각지에서 본 대리석 건축물은 희랍서 배워간 것도 갓다. 이태리에 잇는 대리석 건축물이 굉장하고도 미묘한 것만 嘆賞하지 말고 羅馬보담 더 오래된 아크로폴릐쓰를 더 嘆賞하여야 할 것이다. 삼천여 년전의 희랍인은 삼천 여년 후의 현대인을 경탄식힐 만한 저러한 건축을 하엿스니 그 때의 그 문명이 얼마나, 빗낫든 것을 알 것이다. 만여명이나 안질 좌석을 대리석으로 맨든 경기장은 잘도 맨들엇다. 이 곳에서 古人은 연설도 하얏다고 한다.
이태리인은 예술의 국민이라 하면 희랍인은 철학의 국민이라 할 것이다. 이태리 각지에서는 늘 음악을 들엇다. 길거리에서도, 카페집에서도, 여관에서도, 음식점에서도 어대서든지 음악을 안이들은 때가 별로 업섯다. 가령 상설음악단이 업서도 이 요리점, 저 카페집을 단이면서 음악을 하여주고 손에게서 分錢을 거더 가는 음악단이 잇다. 그러니 희랍에서는 볼 수 업다. 희랍인이 과연 철학의 국민이라 하면 사색하는 것이 그들의 제일 취미가 될 것이니 靜坐黙想하는 것이 무한한 흥미가 잇슬 것이다. 이태리에는 乞人이 만타고 말을 말어라. 희랍에는 엇지나 만흔지 이것을 일너서 不可勝數라 할 것이다. 船便을 기대리노라고 雅典서 일주일을 逗留하는 동안에 낫에는 더위, 밤에는 빈대로 해서 大困境을 칠우엇다. 雅典서 여관이 어대든지 만원이 되는 것이 무리가 안이다. 이곳이 꼭 이태리·土耳其 及 기타 빨칸半島 列國서 오는 三巨里가 되고 말엇스니 外國人의 수효가 얼는 보기에도 대단 만허 보힌다.

赤帽틈에 두 中折帽
더웁고 빈대만튼 雅典을 떠나 피로이스에서 배를 타고 대륙을 버서나니 싀원하기도 하고 歐羅巴의 東端으로 가니 奇風異習을 보게 되는 것이 깃브기도 하다. 이 항해는 저번보담 잛기도 하려니와 靜穩하기가 방안에 안젓는 것 갓다. 좌우에 섬이 총총히 잇거나 그러치안으면 바로 陸地沿邊으로 가게 되니 손을 내밀어서 나뭇가지를 잡을 것도 갓다. 土耳其에 갓가히 들어가니 희랍과 土耳其 양국 연안에 砲臺 걸어 노은 것은 끔직끔직이도 만히 보힌다. 이것을 가르켜 현대인은 國防이라고 한다. 君士坦堡港에 도착하니 벌서 부두에는 赤帽로 덥히엿다. 赤帽案內人에게 위탁하야 입국절차며 行李檢査며 여관까지도 찻기로＜46＞하엿다. 다행히 영어아는 안내인이요, 독일어 아는 여관이야서 이로부터는 言語不通의 곤란은 업게 되엿다.
상점에 든지 혹은 음식점에 가면 불어 밧게 안이 통하는 때가 잇스나 비교적 雅典보담 독일어가 만히 통하는 것은 前日獨帝의 三B정책의 낏트럼이라고 할 것이다. 君士坦丁堡는 前土耳其帝國首府이엿스나 공화국이 된 후로는 안고라가 首府이다. 土耳其帝國의 前日威勢는 말할 것도 업지마는 십구세기 초엽 이후로 歐洲에 잇는 열강이 노골적으로 맹렬히 君士坦丁堡점령을 계획하엿섯지마는, 土耳其의 실력이 잇서서 못된 것이 안이라, 나도 가질수 업고 너도 가질 수 업스니 차라리 土耳其로 하야곰 보존케 하는 것이 良策이라는 데서 나온 것이다. 黑海를 버서 세계에 나서 雄飛하려면 君府를 수중에 늣는 것이 得策이라 하야, 이것으로서 국책을 세운 나라가 露國이다. 이러한 국책을 가젓든 露帝國도 문허지고 俎上肉塊갓든 土耳其帝國도 부서지고 말엇스니 君府를 보는 우리가 今昔之感이 업슬 수가 잇스랴.
인구 일백오천여만을 가진 君府의 市街는 제법 맨들어 노왓스나 그리 큰 건축물은 볼 수 업다. 市중앙에는 큰 철교가 걸처 노혓스니 이것이 독일인의 손으로 가설된 것으로서 통행세를 바드며 이 밋흐로 黑海와 지중해에 통하게 되엿다. 시가가 불결한 것은 雅典이나 맛찬가지며 呼賣商은 베늬쓰나 亦맛찬가지이다. 시가 뒤편으로 들어가면 木製層屋이다. 이것을 볼적에 東京생활을 회상하엿다. 목제층옥만 잇는 것이 안이라 독일 시가처럼 주택이 不高不卑하야 꼭 정돈된 곳도 잇다. 그러나 일반적으로 독일에 따르지 못하게 보힌다. 이 큰 도시에 공장하나 업스니 실업자가 만흔 것은 상상 이상이라 하며 赤帽의 실업자들은 길모퉁이에 서서 버리자리를 찾는 것을 누구든지 볼 것이다.＜47＞어른도 赤帽, 아해도 赤帽, 모도가 赤帽이다. 처음으로 온 외국인이라야 赤帽가 안이지 조곰이라도 오래 된 외국인이면 역시 赤帽이다. 길에 나서면 외국인인지 本國人인지를 곳 알 수 잇다. 그것은 모자로서 알 수 잇나니 어대서 보든지 우리 두사람은 赤帽틈에 두 중절모이엿다. 부인이 외출하는대 黑褓로 얼골을 가리는 것이며 回回敎堂에서 얼골과 手足을 씻고 백번 천번 질을 하여 가면서 예배하는 것도 一種 독특한 습속이다. 쏘피아 교당이 그 중 큰 교당이라 한다. 이 교당은 처음 삐싼틘人이 지은 것으로 多神을 섬기엿스며 그 다음 東羅馬제국시대에는 耶蘇敎교당이 되엿스며 또 그 다음에는 回回敎堂이 되엿나니 교당 南便 끗흐로 잇는 대리석주에 구녁이 잇스며 그 구녁에 손가락을 느어 돌니면 눈물이 나나니 이것이 곳 예수의 눈물이라고 한다. 이것은 回回敎徒와 예수교도가 서로 不和함으로서 맨든 말이다. 그 외에 車便중간기동 상부에 솊�자족이  잇스니 이것이 西曆1453년 모하메트 2세의 손자족이라 한다. 이것도 고지 아니 들린다. 두 길이 넘는 그 꼭댁이에 아모리 馬上이라 하기로 손이 다을 리도 업스며 500년이나 된 금일에 그저 손자족이 남어 잇스리라고는 생각이 안이된다. 이 교당안에도 큰 수통에 물을 담어 놋코 얼골이며 手足을 씻게 한다.

삐싼틘時代의 貯水池와 遊興地
君府가 삐싼틘人의 手中에 잇슬 때에 그들은 만일을 염려하야 땅을 파고 저수지를 맨들엇섯나니 이것을 後人들이 몰낫다가 근래에 발견하얏다고 한다. 지금도 들어가 보면 두 길이나 깁흔 곳에 물이 충충히 괴여 잇다. 삐싼튄 시대의 유물이 이것뿐 안이다. 京城立廛가튼 상점이 잇스니 그 속에 들어가면 白晝에 침침하야 물건을 얼는 알아 보기에 어렵다. 萬種雜貨며 金銀珠玉과 綾羅錦繡며 심지어 음식점까지 잇스되 이 廛房에 안저서 물건을 파는 것은 京城立廛이나 다를 것업다. 마루바닥에 방석을 깔고 안저서 외국인만 보면 물건을 사라고 졸으다 십히 한다. 물건에 에누리는 대단히 심하다. 안내인은 이러케 말하엿다. 상인이 百을 말하거든 하나만 주라고 한다. 이것외에 土耳其시대의 것이 잇다. 어대든지 사람의 소래가 와글와글 한다. 甘水유흥지는 君府에서 약20리되는 것 갓다. 回回敎徒의 휴일인 금요일에는 山野에 人山人海를 이룬다고 한다. 내가 보기에는 그리 조흔 곳도 못된다. 좌우로 나지막한 山이 잇고 그 중앙에 족으마한 내가 흘러서 黑海로 들어가니 이 내가 보기에 精하지도 안으며 달지도 안케 되엿다. 그러나 土耳其人은 이곳을＜48＞일너서 甘水유흥지라 하고 婦女들이 보통이에 음식물을 작만하여 가지고 와서 풀밧헤서 하로를 消暢하고 간다고 한다. 금요일만 되면 가진 구경거리가 이 곳으로 다 모히고 가진 음식점이 다 모혀 들어서 그 날 하로의 환락은 상상키 어려우리라고 한다. 이 날도 여긔저긔 사람들이 뭉텡이 뭉텡이 모혀 안저서 마시며 먹는다. 이 유흥지 엽헤 여자고아학교가 잇스니 교장의 특별한 好竟로 학교를 縱覽하게 되엿다. 이 학교에는 歐洲大戰時와 최근 希土戰爭時에 죽은 이의 딸들을 수용하 는 곳이라 한다. 특히 女敎員을 식혀셔 모든 것을 보히게 한다. 교실, 실습장, 식당, 침실 기타 모든 것을 하나 빼히지 안코 보힌다. 최근 선진국의 것을 模本하야 맨든 것이 엇던 것인들 凡然하랴. 학교 교과까지에 여러 가지 手工이며 기타 살림살이를 가르친다고 한다. 그 때 그 女敎員이 자세한 설명도 해 주거니와 한 번 보기에 인품도 썩 온순해 보인다. 이러케도 분명하고 여자다운 여자는 듬을게 보는 것 갓다. 이러케도 설비 잘한 곳에 이러한 女敎員이 잇는 것은 黑髮黃顔인 그 소녀들에게 얼마나 행복이 될 것이냐. 대체로 土耳其人은 우리와 近似하게 생겻스며 婦女들은 더욱이 朝鮮婦女들과 흡사하여 보인다. 끗흐로 土耳其는 物色이  고흔 것과 禁酒國이란 것을 써두쟈. 禁酒가 엇지도 심한지 맥주도 금하얏슴으로 음식점에서는 카페잔에 맥주를 팔게 된다. 해변에 잇는 皇宮은 잘도 지엇다. 대리석으로 문을 맨들고 그 안 그 굉장한 집에는 歐亞兩대륙에 걸처 잇는 영토를 통치하든 술탄이 起居하엿겟지마는 금일에는 홀로 비워 잇고 前日의  榮華는 사러지고 말엇다.

鐵道沿邊에 水田과 草家
君府에서 뿔가리아國 首府 쏘퓌아까지는 기차로 약 30시간이나 되나니 이것이 급행차이길래 그러치 만일 보통차 일 것 가트면 얼마나 더 딀는지 알 수 업슬 것이다. 도대체 빨칸반도列國의 기차가 더듼 것은 有所聞한 것이다. 급행차라는 것이 每정차장마다 정차를 하니 급행차인지 보통차인지 구별이 나지 안는다. 左右 沿邊에 보잘 것 하나 업고 山野에 인공듸린 것이 보히지 안는다. 다른 곳 가트면 큰 도시가 보히거나 山野에는 인공듸린 것을 볼 수 잇슬 것이다. 그러나 빨칸반도列國에서는 하나도 볼 수 업다. 빨칸반도列國은 아직도 後進이라 제 각각 首府外에 몃 낫 도시를 맨들기에 전력을 다하는 것 가트며 아직도 여력이 잇슬 날이 멀어 보힌다. 沿邊에 잇대야 朝鮮鐵道沿邊에서 보는 것과 가티 초가와 水田뿐이다. 초가가 만키도 土耳其 境內이다. 작년 정월에 波蘭에 갓슬 때에＜49＞초가를 보고 歐羅巴 天地에서 희한한 일이라고 하엿드니 금일에 빨칸반도 列國에서 초가를 보게 되니 歐羅巴도 다 독일과 갓지 안은 줄 알엇다. 독일에도 초가가 업는 것이 안이다. 작년 北歐列國가는 길에도 보앗다. 그러나 그것은 말이 초가이지 벽돌담을 쌋고 치장을 낼대로 내여 지은 層집이엿‹¤. 其外에서 본 초가들은 말대로 초가이엿다. 족음 족음 토담을 쌋코 지여서 게딱지 업허 노흔 것 갓다. 국경에서 조사하는 것은 넘우도 심하다. 小國 일사록 이러한 것은 심하게 보힌다. 뿔가리아 국내에 들어서서 달포만에 雪景을 다시 보앗다. 더위에 복개다가 이 싀원한 것을 보니 마음이 상쾌하다.
쏘퓌아는 인구 십만 밧게 안이 되며 市街도 보잘 것 업다는 것 보담 아직도 들되엿다. 정차장 압헤는 그저 뷔인터가 만코 무슨 계획이 잇는 것가티도 보힌다. 19世 말엽에 지은 希臘正敎堂은 그리 크지는 못하여도 한 번 볼만하며 羅馬에서 보든 敎堂들이나 비슷하다. 市중앙에 공원이 잇대야 京城 빠고다 공원 밧게 안이 되는데 그 조분대 사람만 갓득 차서 여간하야 交椅에 안지 못하게 되엿다. 前日 王宮도 곳 잘 지엿고 대학은 보잘 것 업다. 내용이 얼마나 충실하랴 마는 外形 좃차 탐탁해 보히지 안는다. 국립 박물관이라야 족으마한 집안에 벌녀노흔 것 조차 보잘 것 업고 가지 수도 몃 가지 안이되나 그 중에 눈에 띄우는 것은 뿔가리아人이 얼마나 만히 土耳其人에게 학살을 당햇는가를 보히는 그림 두 장이 잇스니 하나는 土耳其人이 뿔가리아人을 잡어서 눈동자를 빼힌 것과 또 하나는 幼弱을 잡어서 衆人압헤서 학살하는 것이엿다. 우리가 그림을 보고 사지가 떨릴 적에 뿔가리아人이 보면 그 얼마나 피가 끌코 살이 떨닐 것이냐. 암만 생각해 보아도 인류사회에서 강자가 약자를 먹는 것이 僞道이것마는 不知不識간에 국가로나 개인으로나 약육강식이라는 것이 사회진화며 인류생활의 표어가 되고 말엇다. 등에 각종 음료수를 지고 단이면서 길거리에서 팔고 이 곳 역시 가죽 한조각으로 신을 맨들어 신엇스며 털마고자며 통넓은 바지를 입엇고 婦女들은 본국 부인들이 입는 긴저고리와 통 넓은 치마를 입엇스며 농가의 婦女들은 보통이에 여자를 싸서 짐들고 단이듯 하는 것도 奇風이다.

뻴그라드附近一帶의 洪水
알푸스山의 해빙으로 해서 딴윰江은 범람하야 沿江에 물이 안이 든 곳이 업고 유고슬라비아 국 首府인 뻘그라드에도 물란리가 낫다. 물에 막혀 불통되는 기차는 삼사시간이나 중간에서 공사가 끗나기를 기대렷다. 그 怒濤는＜50＞泰山이라도 씰어갈 것 갓다. 피난민은 이곳 저곳에 천막을 치고 살며 人家며 田土가 물 속에 들엇다. 뻴그라드에도 沿江에는 역시 맛챤가지로 물에 놀낸 사람들은 庫間車에서 減水되기를 기대리고 잇다. 뻘그라드는 시가라든가 前日王宮이라든가 각 관청이라든가 모든 것이 쏘퓌아 보담 휠석 나어 보힌다. 王宮 압길은 최신식이다. 人道며 車道가 넓으며 중앙으로 전차가 통하고 좌우로는 각종 상점이 잇스며 그 건축물이 크지는 못해도 묘하게 지엿다. 대학은 두 곳에 난호여 잇스되 그리 크지도 못하고 精하지도 못하다. 停車場 압헤 잇는 공원은 쏘퓌아에 잇는 공원만 하고 딴윱 강변 언덕에 잇는 공원은 적기는 하나 遠景을 바라보기에 매우 좃케 되엿다. 뻴그라드의 인구는 삼십만 이라고 한다. 어대로 보든지 쏘퓌아 보담 커 보히고 시가도 선진국의 것을 만히 모방한 것이 보힌다. 시장에 사람도 만히 모혓고 본국서 보고 먹든 마눌, 파, 풋고초, 애호박, 가지와 갓흔 푸성귀들이 늘어 노혓스며 빨칸반도에 온 後 수년간 맛을 못 보든 것을 맛보게 되엿다. 일요 오우에 틈을 타서 가극구경을 하엿다. 극장이 그리 크지는 못해도 곳잘 맨들엇다. 서투르지 안은 그 기술로 하야 관객에게 칭찬을 밧게 되얏스며 그 때 主役을 하든 남녀 두 배우 목청좃케 노래도 잘 하얏다. 밤에는 강변공원에 산보를 하얏다. 이 때가 음력으로 望日은 되엿나 보다. 山野에 月色은 갓득히 찻고 그 가운데로 급히 흘으는 딴윱江 좌우 연안슗� 잇는 江村에는 殘燈이 반작거리고 江上에는 무수한 증기선이 떠 잇서서 바람 불고 물결 치는 대로 배전에 흰칠한 데에 月色이 빗취니 그 景色 볼 만 하엿고 이 물우헤 걸처 노힌 철교에는 때때로 기차박휘 도는 소래가 夜寂을 께트릴 뿐이다. 이 강에서 배를 타거나 저긔 가는 저 기차를 타면 몃 번을 밧구어 타거나 몃칠을 가거나 엇잿든 사랑하는 고향에 가련마는 하는 생각도 안이난 것도 안이엿다. 이 곳서 멀기도 상당히 멀 것이다. 우리가 빨간반도 중앙지점에 잇스니 이 길이 얼마나 멀 것이며 고생될 것은 더 말할 것도 업다. 이 밤에 이 實景을 보고 이 생각을 한 사람들은 別사람들이 안이엿다. 독일을 떠난지 月餘에 南船北車 안이한 날이 업고 第三國語를 통해서 곤란을 면하려고 하지 안은 때가 업섯다. 어대 가든지 풍속이 殊異하야 숙식에 불편한 적은 업스나 이 나라에서 저 나라로 가고 저 나라에서 이 나라로 가면 언어가 번번히 다르니, 엇던 때에는 이 第三國語가 통하고 또 엇던 때에는 저 第三國語가 안이 통하야 이것을 불편이라 할가. 그리 특출한 불편은 업섯다. 그러나 지리하고 피곤도 하게 되엿다. 예정계획대로 하면 이제 새나라만 더 다녀가면 될 것이다. 이 夜景을 ＜51＞보고 갈 줄 몰으는 동행 金兄이엿다. 나는 明日 일즉 일어날 일을 생각하고 가자고 하엿다. 그이는 조곰조곰하고 갈 줄을 이즌 것도 갓흐며, 재촉하는 나를 괴로히 아는 것도 가티 보엿다.

歐洲에 다시 온 듯한 뿌府
療東칠백리 벌판이 얼마나 넓어 보히고 金堤萬頃 벌판이 얼마나 큰지는 몰으나 빨칸벌판도 상당히 크다고 歐羅巴에서 소문이 난 것이다. 이 넓은 벌판을 午正부터 저녁때가지나 밤이 되어 匃牙利國 首府 뿌다페스트에 이르드록 끗이 안이나고 말엇다. 이 넓은 벌판에 쟁긔에 흰소를 雙으로 메서 春耕이 한창이다. 이 때가 農家의 밧분 때인 것가티 보힌다. 이 논에 물을 대고 저 논을 갈기에 눈코 뜰새가 업슬 것이다. 이 넓은 벌판에 水田도 만히 보히며 이 벌판에서 나는 쌀은 다 무엇에 쓰나 하는 생각도 낫다. 밤늣게 뿌다페쓰트에 다어서 여관을 정하기에 조금 힘이 들엇다면 들엇다 할가. 이것을 힘들엇다고는 할 수 업슬 것이다. 쌍두마차를 타고 안자서 이곳 저곳 다녀스니 이것이 무슨 고생될 것이냐. 그 날 밤을 잘 자고 일어나서 어대 가든지 첫 사무가 돈 밧구는 것임으로 돈을 밧구러 나서 보앗다. 뿌다페스트의 인구는 일백이십만이나 되니 이만하면 상당한 도시 노릇을 할 만하다. 인구만 이러케 만흔 것이 안이라 시가를 보아서 당당한 대도시이다. 이 곳에 와서 다시 中歐都市를 보는 것 갓다. 독일 도시에 비하야 조곰도 손색이 업슬 것이다. 市중앙으로 딴윱江이 흘으고 右편 언덕에 前日왕궁이 놉히 소삿고 그 언덕 우헤 올으면 全景을 總覽할 수 잇게 되얏스며 左便강변에 의회당이 人目을 끌게 하니 이것이 영국의회당을 본떠서 지은 것이라 한다. 장엄하게도 잘도 지엿다. 왕궁의 터 조흔 것이라든지 의회당의 장엄한 것은 歐羅巴 각국에서 본 것 중에 제일일＜52＞것이다. 딴윱江上에는 여러 개의 철교가 걸처 노헛지마는 그 중에도 엘리사베드橋는 튼튼히 잘도 노왓고 크기도 매우 크며 보기도 매우 좃타. 이만한 것들을 가젓는 대 歐羅巴列國틈에 끼여서 국가 노릇하기에 무삼 부족이 잇스랴. 江左便 카페집들도 잘도 맨들엇다. 주머니에 카페 한 잔 갑이라도 잇는 사람이면 그냥 지내지는 못하리라. 음악을 하야 귀를 즐겁게 하고 江色을 보여 눈을 깃브게 하고 맥주와 카페를 팔어 입맛을 나게 하니 이러한 조흔 곳이 흔할 것이냐. 春日에 江上船遊도 滋味잇슬 것이며 秋夜에 橋上觀月도 亦 상쾌할 것이다. 나는 경성을 잠간 생각하여 보앗다. 성내에서 漢江철교로 船遊나 月觀 가쟈면 먼저 먼지를 뒤집어 쓰고 그 다음 파리들에게 근질 대이고 긧건 보고 온다는 것이 강변 沙場에 덤불이 욱웃이 낫거나 게딱지 가튼 초가들 뿐이엿다. 이것과 딴윱강변과는 비교할 수 업는 差等이다. 뿌府의 市民은 먼지를 뒤집어 쓰지도 안코 파리에게 근질대이지도 안코 아주 편하게 船遊며 觀月을 하는 것이다.
匃牙利人은 얼는 보면 蒙古人種에 近似한 사람들이 만흐며, 자기네들이 자칭 蒙古人種이라 하지마는 純然한 蒙古人種은 얼마업게 되고 歐羅巴人의 특징인 異族相婚으로 하야 혼혈족이 되고 말엇다. 고초가루 만히 먹기로는 匃牙利人이 제일일 것이다. 어느 음식에 고초가루 안이 드는 것이 업고, 그 중에도 고초가루를 만히 느어 맨드는「꿀라」는 맛잇기로 유명한 것이다.

歷史上으로 보아 有名한 維府
밤늣게야 墺地利國 首府 維也納에 다엇다. 정차장에는 李金兩友가 나와서 마저 주엇스며 여관까지 정해 주어서 조곰도 불편이 업섯고 오일간이나 逗留하면서 兩兄에게＜53＞넘우도 애를 쓰게 하얏다. 墺地利도 大戰이 끗나기 전까지는 歐羅巴에서 한목을 보앗지마는 大戰이 끗나자 墺地利匃牙利제국은 5,6月 토담 문어지듯 하야 버렷다. 이 영토도 독립 저 영토도 독립하며, 이 나라도 南便을 조곰 띄여 가고 저 나라도 東便을 조곰 떼여 가서 지금은 前日의 융성은 어대로 가고 빨칸 小弱國들이나 별로 틀릴 것이 업다. 금일의 現勢로 보면 지방이 팔만사천 平方米突이니 이것을 朝鮮에 비하면 삼분의 일보담 만코 인구가 육백오십만이니 이거을 조선에 비하면 절반도 못되며 維也納에는 인구가 일백팔십사만이나 되니 전 인구의 약 삼분지일이나 되는 것이다. 維也納 시가는 독일 시가들과 가티 신식이 못되고 구식이다. 대학 압길과 2,3處를 除하고는 도로에 樹木이 업고 규율이 째히지 못하얏스며 가옥이 오래되엿고 허수하게 보힌다. 대학도 伯林大學이나 비슷하게 날것스며 市중앙에 공원도 잘도 맨들엇고 夜間秦樂까지 잇스니 長長한 夏日더위에 복개다가 밤이 되야 공원에 산보도 하며 樹下에 안저서 아이스크림을 먹으면서 저 嚠喨한 음악을 듯는 것이 얼마나 싀원하고도 상쾌한 것이냐. 古人은 이런 것을 지칭하야 萬斛의 凉味라 하얏지마는, 우리가 지낸 이 凉味는 萬斛도 더 될 것이 다흠신 늘여 億斛의 凉味라고나 할가나. 대개 有數한 연극장은 夏期休業이고 雜也納에서 제일 크다는 敎堂도 伊太利에서 보는 것에 비하면 그리 클 것도 업다.
푸라토어라는 유흥지 곳잘 맨들엇다. 그 곳에 가면 여러 가지 滋味잇게 놀수가 잇나니 소규모의 연극장들이며 타고 올나가는 것도 잇스며 타고 도는 것도 잇고 적은 돈을 내고 재수가 조흐면 만흔 상을 타는 것도 잇고 2,3요리점에는 婦人奏樂이 잇서서 늘 좌석이 만원이고 이곳저곳에 사람이 몰케 서서 夜間에는 꽤 사람이 모허든다. 그러나 이것을 伯林에 잇는 루나팕에 비하면 장식도 그만 못하고 모든 채려 노흔 것이 어림업슬 것이다. 일주에 三次式夜間噴水는 전등을 이용하야 순간순간에 다른 빗이 나오게 되얏스며 이것을 보려고 廣庭에 사람들은 가든 거름을 멈추고 서게 된다. 숀부른이라는 宮城 잘도 꾸미엿다. 이것을 독일로 일느면 폿스담에 잇는 쌍수씨 宮城가튼 곳이니 그 곳은 푸리드릭大王이 기거하든 곳이며 이 곳은 西曆18세기 중엽에 歐洲정치계에 중심인물의 觀이 잇든 마리아데레시아를 필두로 하야 최근에는 大戰을 치룬 푸란쓰요세프帝가 기거하든 곳이라 한다. 내부에 꾸며 노흔 것은 다른 궁성보담 특출한 것은 업스나 그 중에도 마리아데레시아가 백만꿀덴(和蘭貨)을 듸려서 맨들엇다는 방 하나는 그만한 가치가 이서 보힌다. 이 방은＜54＞和蘭人을 불너다가 고귀한 木材를 쓰고 금전으로 장식하엿나니 사치할 대로 사치한 것이다. 정원이 쌍수씨에 비하면 물론 적으나 매우 방불해 보히며 석양을 띄워 산보도 꽤 할 만하다. 일요 오후에 코벤쓸로 산보가는 것도 꽤 滋味잇다. 안이 산보라는 것보담 山上 카페집에 안저서 카페를 마시며 遠景을 보는 것이다. 시내 전차로 산 밋까지 가서는 그 곳서는 자동차가 올나 가게 되얏스며 길에는 타마油를 발너서 먼지가 날 까닭이 업스며 山이라야 놉기가 京城 南山의 삼분지읊�밧게 안이 되지마는 樹林속에는 人林이 낫고 山우에는 자동차가 줍대여 노헛고 카페집마다 만원이요, 그 중에도 위치가 조흔 곳에는 廣庭을 꿈엿고 그 廣庭에는 좌석을 엇기가 어려울 지경이다. 이 날 오후에는 維也納의 사람들은 다 온 곳도 가티 생각된다. 昨秋 瑞典國首府에서 일요 오후를 보고 사람이 만히 나온데에 놀내엿더니 이 날 오후도 그만 못하지 안케 보힌다. 普魯西國 푸리드릭대왕의 말과 가티 사람은 일하려 낫다는 것이 的確하다 하면 日曜一日잇는 것이 그들에게 얼마나 반갑고 깃블 것이냐.
維也納은 경치로나 古蹟으로나 미술로나 엇던 것으로나 별로 特書할 것은 업슬 것이다. 물론 약간의 경치가 잇다 하드래도 瑞西나 瑞典에 비할 수 업슬 것이며 약간의 古蹟이 잇다 하드래도 伊太利나 독일에 비할 수 업슬 것이며 약간의 미술이 잇다 하드래도 역시 伊太利나 佛蘭西에 비할 수 업슬 것이다. 그 외에 지방으로 보아 인구로 보아 산업으로 보아 어듸로 보아 歐米有數列國보담 특출한 것은 업고 특출한 것이 잇다 하면 流行製出地라는 것과 維也納美人이라는 것 뿐일 것이다. 현재는 그럿타하고 과거를 생각해 보면 금일의 維也納과는 딴판일 것이다. 西曆18세기 이전에는 歐洲의 국가들이 未熟品이얏나니 그럼으로 歐洲列國의 국제관계는 그리 錯雜지 안엇고 딸하서 對內對外하야 금일가튼 難문제가 극히 적엇스며 물론 이 때에는 歐洲외교계의 중심은 파리라 하되 가장 유치하엿든 것이다. 그러나 18세기에 들어서서 歐洲의 국가들이 성숙하여 들어가려 할 때에는 외교계의 중심세력은 파리에서 옴기여서 維也納으로 오게 되엿나니 권모술수를 外交의 책략으로 하는 18세기 중엽의 歐洲外交界를 보면 維也納 중심으로 하야 파리 聖彼得保 伯林이라는 三線이 매여 잇고 그 외에 倫敦線이 잇지마는 이것은 미미하얏든 것이다. 歐洲의 형세는 이와 가티 되야 歐洲의 국가들은 점점 성숙되여 가다가 나폴레온 1세의 阻害가 잇다 하되 그것은 가장 단시일이얏스며 이 단시일동안에 나폴레온 1세는 지도를 패놋코＜55＞自意로 색채를 밧구어서 一時는 歐洲列國의 전통적 관계라든가 또는 민족적 감정을 무시하고 歐洲 全土를 혼란하게 맨들엇스나 1813년 歐洲列國聯合自由戰爭은 1815년 維也納公會를 열고 나폴레온 1세의 시설을 개조케 핊�다는 것이 역시 나폴레온 1세가 한 것이나 小毫도 다르지 안케 하엿고 이 시기를 경계선으로 하야 歐洲의 국가들은 확실히 성숙되엿고 이를 前後하야 민주사상이 팽창하게 되매 爲政者들은 이것을 압박하기로만 良策을 삼엇고 이로부터 강대국들에 부속된 약소민족들은 자유운동을 일으키게 되매 강대국들은 이것을 진압하는 데는 가진 暴虐을 햇스되 正義人道라는 문자는 製出하지 안엇다. 維也納公會가 잇슨 후에 외교계의 중심은 維也納을 떠낫스나 일정한 자리를 못엇고 倫敦으로 가는 것도 갓고 혹은 聖彼得保로 가는 것도 갓도 또 혹은 伯林으로 가는 것도 갓하엿스나 영영 근거지를 엇지 못하고 말엇스며 이후로브터는 列國은 부국강병으로 國是를 삼엇나니 이것이 하필 독일뿐일 것이냐. 영국이 그러하고 佛國이 그러하고 露國이 그러하고 그 외에 약소국들이 그러하엿스며 이로부터 六大强國이니 七大强國이 생기게 되얏스며 歐洲의 交外界는 가장 錯亂하게 되고 歐洲列國의 위정자들은 朝夕으로 新消息을 안이 듯는 날이 업게 되얏스며 외교계의 중심이든 維也納은 추풍이 불게 되얏다.

獨逸最古大學이 잇는 푸府
사백년 간이나 墺地利國합스부륵家에 부속되야 잇든 뽀헤미아 왕국은 大戰 후에 독립이 되얏나니 大戰이 시작된 후에 뽀헤미아人은 大戰에 참여하고 西伯利亞에서 養兵하엿고 파리에서 假政府를 조직하엿섯다고 한다. 大戰이 끗나고 공화국이 되니 國號를 첵크슬로바키아라 하엿스며 首府푸락은 인구가 이십이만이며 西曆紀元1348년 독일황제 칼4세가 창립한 대학이 이곳에 잇스니 이것이 독일대학의 嚆矢라 하며 그 외에 첵크슬로바키아대학이 잇스나 外樣으로는 두 대학이 다 보잘 것업다. 市街는 維也納과 가티 구식이며 불결하고 박물관 압길 하나 잘하여 노왓고 박물관에 礦物표본진열관도 안히 모아 노왓다. 이곳이 礦物표본진열관이 안인데 이와 가티 종류며 數爻가 풍부한 것은 歐洲에서 보든 중 츠옴이다. 몰다우 강변에 잇는 의회당도 匃牙利것에 비하면 아모것도 안이고 一私家가티 보힌다. 歐洲古都市들에서 보는 것과 가티 꼬불꼬불한 새 골목에 얏흔 2,3層 집들이 만히 잇스니 이것들을 헐어 버리고 更築하기 전에는＜56＞ 新市街는 보기 어려울이것다. 이 곳 사람들도 墺地利人처럼 밤11시에나 유흥을 시작하야 이것이 끗나자면 새벽4시가 되나니 이로해서 兩夜는 숙면을 못하게 되엿다. 이 곳에는 아조 적은 여관이면 몰을가 그러치 안으면 조고마한 무도장이 하나식은 다 잇는 것가티 보힌다. 독일서는 이러한 것을 보랴 볼 수 업다. 새벽1시가 警察시간임으로 더 느지랴야 느질 수 업게 된다. 이곳도 警察시간이 새벽4시까지라 하되 이것은 넘우 느진 것이다. 이 곳 사람들은 波蘭人과 近似하며 獨逸人과 一見에 다른 것을알 수 잇나니 안색이 누르며 모발이 흑색에 갓가워 보힌다. 삼일만에 푸락을 떠나 몃 시간 안이가서 독일 국경에 들어서 엘베江과 色遜國 瑞西를 石便으로 보면서 뜨레스덴까지 왓다. 色遜國 瑞西는 경치가 瑞西國과 갓다 하야서 그와 가티 得名한 것이니 작년 初夏에 色遜國 瑞西를 구경하고 엘베江에 배를 띄워 뜨레스텐까지 와 보앗나니, 그 때에는 경치도 매우 좃타고 하엿더니 정말 瑞西를 보고 나니 假字瑞西는 그것에 비할 것이 안이다. 그러나 뜨레스덴 가티 精하고 도시다읍게 끰여 노흔 것은 歐羅巴에서 듬을 것이다. 北歐列國 중에는 或間잇스나 南歐나 빨칸반도에서는 볼 수 엽슬 것이다. 그 뿐 안이라 독일 각 도시 중에 이러한 곳이 몃 곳 안이될 것이다. 뜨레스덴에서 伯林까지는 순식간에 오는 것 가트며 近이개월이나 南船北車하다가 오닛가 그러한지는 몰으나 伯林에 오는 것 갓지 안코 京城에 오는 것가티 생각이 되얏섯다.

五十日間에 九國
四月九日에 伯林을 떠나 西南方面으로 국경을 넘어 瑞西國3도시를 보고 다시 南下하야 이태리에 가서 7도시를 보고 이태리 南端에서 선편으로 더 南下하야 희랍반도를 돌아 조곰 北上하야 희랍국에 상륙해서 2도시를 보고 이곳서 다시 선편으로 동북으로 조곰 올나 土耳其國에 상륙하야 一도시 보고 이곳서 서북방면으로 올나 뿔가리야 유고슬라비아 匃牙利의 각 一도시를 보고 이로부터 西向하야 墺地利와 北上하야 첵크슬로바키아의 각 一도시를 보고 독일 東南국경을 넘어 東便으로 조곰 돌아 5월 27일에 떠나든 정차장에 다시 다엇스니 이 일자가 1일 부족되는 50일이오, 단녀 온 나라 數爻로 하면 九國이요, 日字와 이 여비를 가젓스면 伯林서 떠나 瑞西를 지나 佛國 馬耳塞港에서 선편으로 지중해 인도양을 것처서 日本門司에 상륙하야 귀국하기에 넉넉할 것이다. 歐洲에서 공업국을 헤여 보면 독일과 영국일 것이다. 戰前에는 墺地利도 準工業國은 되엿스나 戰後에＜57＞영토가 四分五裂한 결과 그것이나마 유지가 못되고 말엇다. 이 두 공업국 외에는 거의 다 농업국이거나 상업국일 것이다. 가령 말하면 瑞西나 이태리가 農商業國이지 공업국이 안이며 빨칸반도列國들이 일제히 농업국이며 큰 공장 하나 눈에 띄우지 안코 純然히 지방에 의지하야 五穀을 심으고 가축을 길너서 이것들로 生活之方을 삼는 것가티 보힌다. 어느 벌판 어느 산 빈양이에 牛羊의 떼들을 안이 본 적이 업섯다. 이것이 南歐나 빨칸列國이 그러한 것이 안이라 역시 공업국이 안인 北歐列國들이 그러하다.
도시의 시설로 보아 독일에 따를 나라가 듬을 것이다. 내가 露國이나 西班牙나 葡萄牙나 영국을 보지 못하얏스닛가는 그 四國도 독일에 따르지 못하리라고 평할 수는 업스나 몰으면 몰으되 영국 외의 三國은 독일에 따르지 못한다고 하야도 이것이 과히 誤評은 안일 것이다. 말인즉 영국도 독일에 따르지 못하다고 하나 아직것 正評할 용기는 업다. 歐洲列國 중에서 엇던 나라든지 그 나라의 首府이든지 혹은 2,3중요도시를 독일 각 도시에 비교하야 近似한 것이 업는 것이 안이나 독일처럼 甲都市에서 乙都市를 가 보든지 또는 乙都市에서 丙都市에 가보든지 一樣으로 시설된 나라는 우헤도 말한 것과 가티 극히 듬을 것이다. 물가로 보면 내가 아는 歐洲列國 중에서는 독일이 제일 高騰할 것이며 외국인에게 대해서는 일반적으로 親功해 보히며 돈을 더 바드려 하는 것도 일반적으로 보히지마는 그 중에도 이태리와 빨칸반도列國이 尤甚한 것가티 생각된다. 이태리와 빨칸반도 列國에 외국인들이 대단이 만흔 것은 더 말할 것도 업지마는 독일인도 英米人에 못지 안케 만흐며 朝鮮사람은 나와 동행 金兄과의 2인 외에는 업섯다. 羅馬에서 在留同胞를 차지려 하엿스나 그것은 허사가 되고 말엇다. 英獨佛 삼국어의 통하는 것으로 보면 北歐에서는 英獨語의 순서며 南歐며 빨칸列國에서는 佛英語의 순서이며 일반적을 통하는 것은 영어가 세계어의 觀이 잇다.(8월 1일)＜58＞
