Brothers Across the Border and Brothers at the Border

Across the Border! The Border! What 'across the border' and what 'border' do they mean?
It means that side of the Amnok River (鴨綠江) and this side of the Amnok River. Ah, stop! To speak of it would instead bring shame upon our Brothers and disgrace upon Chosŏn (朝鮮); let us pretend not to know and leave it be.
But we cannot do that. We absolutely cannot just watch as if watching someone else's shamanistic ritual. We cannot but make it public. Even if we do, there's not much we can achieve, but still, there is a need for the general public to know. If people do not know, then even the spirits must know.
However, the freedom to make it public is not yet available. Words that came up to the throat, up to the tip of the tongue, are simply gulped down. Characters that came down to the fingertips, down to the tip of the brush, just shoot back up. Ah—how truly lamentable! It is no better than the situation of the Brothers Across the Border! Therefore, I will convey only the news within the possible scope.

□ Hearing the News of the Brothers Across the Border
The Border? Setting a tiny river between us, saying this is my land, that is your land—even this, viewed through the eyes of modern people, seems like children's hand-play, but what can be done when past human society ended up like that? The future is the future, and the present is the present; inevitably, as Brothers Across the Border, we receive such bitter and painful news.
It is said that the lives and property of our Korean brothers who moved to Changbaekbu (長白府) across from Hyesanjin (惠山鎭) are completely in their (彼等) hands, and they hold the power of life and death as they please. The recent Sŏ Pyŏngnyul (徐秉律) shooting incident (被穀事件) this autumn and the incident of Korean merchants closing their shops (撤市事件), etc., would typically become international issues for a people with adequate political protection, but as our brothers have no master and no support, with nowhere to appeal,<114> they gaze only at the silent blue sky, crying out laments of having left their country.
The Sŏ Pyŏngnyul shooting incident! "Did you do a good deed?" "Yes." "Eek! You deserve to die!" "Did you—do an evil deed?" "Yes." "Eek! You deserve to be killed!"—It's like this. Regardless of good or evil, right or wrong, if they want to kill, they kill; if they want to let live, they let live. Human life is like this, and property is also the same, they say. "Do you have money?" "Yes." "Hand it over." "You don't have money?" "No." "Let's see if you do."—It's like this, they say. Wicked villains with twisted minds play with them like with children. Sŏ Pyŏngnyul, too, without cause—no, even after doing good—became a guest of no return under their guns, they say. That is, near Changbaekbu, in Kimhwajin (金華鎭), there is their police station (警察廳). One day (date unknown), Mr. Sŏ performed obligatory labor service repairing the wall of that police station. When he finished the work and was about to return home at sunset, whether out of ill will or goodwill, they gave him a few cups of alcohol as compensation for the hard labor. So, he was delayed a bit and had to return home when it was dark. After laboring all day without any pay, receiving only a bitter-sweet cup of alcohol, while returning home in the middle of the night, he encountered a troop of their policemen who appeared out of nowhere on the road. As soon as they met, without asking right or wrong, with a single gunshot, our 22-year-old youth, Mr. Sŏ, collapsed—it was like this.
They shot and killed an innocent, good person without reason. They used the pretext of punishing the perpetrator with dismissal and reporting to the provincial governor for disposition, but recently, they completely pardoned him with a fine of 300 won, they say. It's like this. One human life is offset by 300 won. It is clearly like this, they say.
The Market Closure Incident (撤市事件)—For Koreans to engage in commerce on the land across the border, they must frequently undergo surveillance by their officials. Goods crossing the river must have customs duties paid (according to legal regulations, within three days of importing goods). However, this autumn, Mr. Ko Sŏng'u (高聖禹), our merchant within Changbaekbu, purchased 100 won worth of goods from Hyesanjin. Immediately upon crossing the river, their policemen (who followed along with the goods) came to Mr. Ko and forcibly collected a fine of 50 won under the charge of tax evasion (漏稅), they say. When he protested, saying that since the legal regulation allows three days, coming immediately after purchase to claim tax evasion was unlawful, they cited an order from the authorities and detained Mr. Ko. In the end—he had to pay the 50 won. Their law is such that there is no examination of good or evil, right or wrong; once an order is given, the matter is pursued relentlessly until collection is complete. Even if it means ten years of imprisonment, the payment must eventually be made—that's their law. It's like this. This became an issue, and the Korean brothers held a community meeting (民會) to discuss countermeasures. In the end—they concluded, what's the point of engaging in commerce in a place like this where there isn't even a shred of guarantee for our lives and property? Even if we do, it's just handing everything over to them one by one. It would be better to starve <115> to death; at least we wouldn't suffer such unsightly things. So they closed their shops all at once. They pretend not to notice, just smirking as if to say, 'Why should we be afraid of you closing your shops?' they say.
Is that all? In the same year, Mr. Pae Yŏngsuk (裴永淑) was fined 490 won and forced out of business for the crime of selling 16 *mal* of rice produced in China and several pairs of hemp shoes made by local Koreans, they say. And is that all? Whenever the thought occurs to them, they suddenly rush in and search the shops.
While searching, they 'discover' items like opium (阿片) among the goods and levy fines of tens or hundreds of won for the crime of selling prohibited items secretly (in reality, as a pretext for searching and extortion, the searcher often brings the contraband hidden on their person, so it is best for the shop owner to search the searcher first upon entry). If unable to pay, they are imprisoned indefinitely. Therefore, it is said to be common practice to suffer the triple hardship of forced labor, paying money, and imprisonment.

The autumn rain drizzles down. It flows sluggishly<116>. Many spirits weep. Across the border, white-clad figures (白衣人) can still be dimly seen. Men are seen, and women too. A young child following its mother out to the cabbage patch—ah, seeing him brings tears streaming down. Seeing the young child across the border, my face, along with the autumn rain, became wet.

□ What Consolation Can Be Given to the Compatriots at the Border!
The news from across the border is like that, but what about the news from this side? Let's not even speak of it. Indeed, there is no freedom to make it public. Still, within the permissible scope, I will introduce their living conditions. Below Paektusan (白頭山), along the Amnok River—for the brothers living there, would the time before March 1st (己未前) and after March 1st (己未後) be much different? But after March 1st, they are truly self-restrained. Anyway, the question is what consolation can be given to them. Even the once-common oats and potatoes are now hard to come by, they say. Slash-and-burn farming (火田) cannot be done, and firewood (火木) is also a problem, they say. There is nowhere to learn and nowhere to hear news. They cannot read newspapers or magazines (because they have no money, transportation is inconvenient, and the police are bothersomely noisy). They cannot go out freely, nor can they practice their religion freely, they say. The total annual income for a household is merely 20 or 30 won, yet the state duties (國役) are still levied—they say. More than anything, ○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○
Ah—what consolation can be given to them? They greet the reporter gladly, but worrying about what might happen after the reporter leaves, they consider meeting the reporter a cause for anxiety.
Ah—ah, what consolation can be given to our Border Brothers, who live as they were born, innocent, without malice or sin!?<117>
<114-117>

**Summary**

This 1924 article from *Kaebyŏk* magazine laments the suffering of Koreans living on both sides of the Yalu River border. It details the brutal injustices faced by "Brothers Across the Border" (Koreans in Manchuria, specifically near Changbaek) at the hands of Chinese authorities and police, including arbitrary killings (like Sŏ Pyŏngnyul's), extortion disguised as fines or taxes (Ko Sŏng'u's case, Pae Yŏngsuk's case), planting of contraband like opium during searches, and the general lack of legal protection for life and property, leading to a merchant strike (撤市). The author contrasts this with the plight of "Brothers at the Border" (Koreans on the Korean side), whose suffering cannot be openly discussed due to censorship (indicated by circles). However, it hints at extreme poverty, restrictions on farming (火田), movement, information access (newspapers/magazines), religious practice, and heavy state burdens (國役), all under oppressive surveillance that makes even meeting a reporter dangerous for them. For historians, the article is valuable for its contemporary account of the perilous conditions faced by Korean migrants in Manchuria, illustrating the lawlessness and vulnerability they experienced beyond the reach of Japanese colonial power but subject to local Chinese oppression. It also starkly reveals the climate of censorship within colonial Korea itself, where even describing the hardships of Koreans under Japanese rule was impossible, forcing the author into veiled language and omissions (the '○○○' section).
