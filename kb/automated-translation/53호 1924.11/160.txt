The Sight of the Morning Market and Women
I already knew that "Hamgyŏng Province markets are women's markets," so it wasn't entirely extraordinary, but it was so overwhelming that I shall try to describe it.
Markets elsewhere open once every five days, but the coastal markets in Hamgyŏng Province open daily. When they open, it's not that the entire populace gathers for the whole day and night; rather, mostly women gather, conduct their business only in the morning (roughly from 7 AM to 10 AM, about 3 hours), and then disperse. Hence, it's called the Morning Market (朝市場).
Well then—it's time for the Morning Market to open. Let's go out and see. They gather. They gather from all directions. Carrying things on their heads, holding things, with things tucked under their arms, carrying babies on their backs, they surge in tumultuously. Those carrying fresh fish in long wooden basins are the most numerous. Many also carry rice, beans, pears, and peaches on their heads. Many carry chickens under their arms and hold bundles of eggs. But those carrying their shoes are the most numerous. Many carry babies on their backs while balancing basins on their heads. Purple inner ribbons and pink outer ribbons, each about a foot long, flutter over shoulders and under armpits like kite tails.
It's a bustling marketplace, so all sorts of merchants gather. Having traveled different trade routes, east and west, there are no beauties. Feet are king-sized, hands are like northern rakes. Some have their hair in a bun, others have it loosely tied up. The majority have their breasts exposed.
We entered the market. It feels like being inside a matchbox, impossible to move an inch. One wrong move and you could lose your nose or get your feet trampled. Let's look at the fish market. Flounder are most plentiful, mackerel are many, herring are many, frozen pollack are also there, pickled oysters are there, and many other fish of unknown names<114> are there. Asking the price, one says "tat ton" (닷돈 - five *don*). When I say, "Five *chŏn* (五錢) would be cheap," she then says "Ten *chŏn* (十錢)." "Make it cheaper." "No cheaper." "Ahmang'i" (아망이 - term for woman/wife). "Ajubangi" (아즈방이 - term for man/husband). "Give it to me." "Alright." "Let's go together." "Hey Ahmang'i, have you seen my baby?" All sorts of dialect words burst forth, making my ears ache quite a bit, and it's very hard to understand. Let's look at the food stalls. Sorghum taffy, bean *kwajil* (과질 - confection), millet cake, glutinous rice cake, Japanese noodles, Chinese noodles, all sorts of food are plentiful. The one saying, "Tteok—won't you make it cheaper? A little cheaper," is a middle-aged woman of about 40, breasts exposed, mouth slightly crooked as if afflicted by a stroke. Let's look at the fruit stalls. Apples (*imkŭm sagwa* - 林檎 사과), pears, boiled pears, small peaches are most numerous. The rice stall is the same, the firewood stall is the same; only the miscellaneous goods stall has many men.
Let's stop looking. Seeing one thing, you know ten thousand; the atmosphere of the Morning Market is fully understood.
When these people leave the market for the day, they go to villages to sell, go to fishing grounds to buy, or wander around peddling; they certainly don't go home to sit or lie down. Their outward appearance seems a bit rough and worldly-wise, but their inner spirit is a fine quality that cannot be found elsewhere.
This is why it's said there's no distinction between rich and poor in Hamnam (咸南).

The Sight of Inns and Restaurants
"Don't even talk about inn life in North Korea (北鮮)," a friend advised me. Indeed. It's not that the houses are messy or the rooms are dirty. It's not that the rice is bad or the side dishes are lacking either (though the food preparation is not without its shortcomings). Unkind owner, unbearable servant—this is the problem. People from North Korea (北鮮) are known to be brusque, but for an innkeeper to be this curt even towards guests was utterly unexpected. You have to call an errand boy three or five times before you see him, and you have to ask seven or eight times before you get washing water, so what's the point of talking about kindness or unkindness? Is it any wonder that from the mouth of an optimistic friend like Yare came the brilliant line, "Calling a thousand, ten thousand times, they don't come out; the lonely guest in a northern inn struggles to get water"?
Can't they be a little kinder (surely not all are like this)? And the sight of the restaurants! Any house with a sign attached outside the kitchen door (鼎住밧게) is, without asking, known to be a restaurant. What's inside? Only pre-boiled starch noodles or bland, smelly *soju* (燒酒). Oh wait, there's also meat soup (*changguk* - 장국). If you ask for noodles, they grab a portion from the pre-boiled pile, rinse it once quickly, and serve it with three or four slices of radish kimchi that look like cattle fodder (what's left after threshing grain - 穀草쓴 것) and three or four pieces of dried, stiff meat. That's it. The meat soup is the same style. This is the sight. That's why respectable people, or those accompanying such people, invariably go to a Chinese restaurant. The appearance of those places is the same, but still, the cooking method is different—<115> Can't they make it a bit cleaner and more appetizing?

The Sound of *Changŭi* and the Sight of *Dopo*
Hamnam (咸南) was still a world of Confucian scholars (儒林世界). Go to P'ungsan (豊山), there are *changŭi* officials (掌議直員); go to Kapsan (甲山)—is it any wonder that even the Pukch'ŏng Old School Support Association (北靑故普期成會) reportedly issued *changŭi* appointment letters (掌議帖) multiple times? Kim Changŭi, Pak Changŭi—it seems one couldn't be addressed without the title *changŭi* (掌議). And these esteemed *changŭi* still wear the *topo* (道袍 - traditional scholar's robe) and walk like scholars. What with this *sŏwŏn* (書院 - Confucian academy) and that *che* (齊 - study hall), calling places Ch'unjŏng (春亭 - Spring Pavilion) or Ch'ujŏng (秋亭 - Autumn Pavilion), fluttering their *topo*, reeking strongly of dog meat, and bustling back and forth to the upper and lower memorial service halls (*sangha chech'ŏng* - 上下祭廳), this sight—like looking at an antique—is truly a peculiar spectacle. I saw this sight once myself, and it was also the talk among friends like me.

Why So Many Bobbed-Haired Maidens?
They say bobbed-haired beauties (*tanbal miin* - 斷髮美人) are appearing frequently in places like Seoul or P'yŏngyang, but in places like Pukch'ŏng (北靑), Iwŏn (利原), and Tanch'ŏn (端川), there were said to be many bobbed-haired maidens (*tanbal ch'ŏnyŏ* - 短髮處女). I don't know the reason, but those—definitely maidens, flower-like young ladies—all had hair that hadn't grown long, like people recovering from a high fever. Whether older maidens or young girls, generally their hair was short.
Therefore, from the aspect of beauty, it's a bit disappointing. Shh—judging maidens is strictly forbidden. But since it's not a judgment of faces, only of hair seen from behind, it probably doesn't matter much.

Pukch'ŏng's South Gate
Do the officials of Pukch'ŏng County (北靑郡廳員) have no eyes? It seems they go about their days without seeing the messy sight of the South Gate (南大門). If they tore down the South Gate, they should have cleaned it up completely. But to tear down the main gate of their own county, which they boast of as a major town in Kwanbuk (關北大邑), and leave the good timber abandoned right there on the three-way street to rot—what on earth are they thinking? If they were going to let it rot like that, they should have at least given it to the poor citizens for firewood. If they couldn't do that, they should have sold it to supplement public funds. If they couldn't even do that, they should have at least stored it properly so it wouldn't rot.—Ah, right, because it's not personal property but public property (公有), everyone just pretends not to see it. So-called Pukch'ŏng County authorities (北靑郡 當局者), what is your responsibility? Don't your ears burn from the citizens' public opinion? What a sight—

Why So Many Advisors Right from the Start of a Meeting?
Hearing that the inaugural general meeting of the Hyesan Youth Association (惠山靑年會創立總會) was opening, I went to offer congratulations and have a look. The meeting began, and roll call was taken. A report on the progress was given.<116> A report on the draft rules was given. They voted article by article. After passing the rules, they immediately proceeded to elect advisors (顧問). Alright—here they come. The advisors emerge. First, the Chief of Police (警察署長) comes out. Second, the Principal of the Public School (公普校長) comes out. Third, the Director of the Chahye Hospital (慈惠醫院長) comes out. Fourth, the Director of the Forestry Station (營林廠長) comes out. Fifth, the Commander of the Military Police Detachment (憲兵分隊長) comes out. Sixth, the Head of Pohye Township (普惠面長) comes out. Seventh, the Administrator of the School Association (學校組合管理員) comes out... Are there no more? There are so many, it's fine if one or two were missed. Why so many advisors (顧問何其多)? Oh, right.
Shh—It's the border region! The border region! Without doing this, you can't run a Youth Association or anything else. Honestly, what does it matter about the advisors? As long as the Youth Association does well, isn't that enough?
A word to the Hyesan Youth Association (惠山靑年會). This is certainly not a scheme to nitpick at your association. I understand that your association couldn't avoid doing this, that it's a formality, not the inner substance, adopted out of necessity to maintain a spring-like atmosphere (春風格) all around. This is just to let brothers in other regions know, as a small example, that even running a Youth Association in the border region requires such measures.

Being Insulted by Japanese Women
Some people say they discreetly hide the insults they suffer, but I will speak out. Assimilationists (同化主義者) might purse their lips upon hearing this, but generally, Japanese men and women (日本년놈 - derogatory), one cannot help but say, are an island people with no leeway, destined to be rejected here. This happened right in Sinp'o (新浦). The day before, I had bought a bus ticket from Pukch'ŏng (北靑) to Hamhŭng (咸興), got off at Sinp'o to attend to some business, and had made a prior arrangement to definitely leave on this day. A Japanese person also had a similar situation and intended to ride together. He had stayed one day less than me. However, things didn't go according to the arrangement. The bus arrived already full from Pukch'ŏng. Neither of us could get on. What use was it to blame the bus company for its lack of trustworthiness when the bus was already full? Inevitably, it meant either walking or staying another day. I stood there dumbfounded. The Japanese man, despite the bus being full, insisted on squeezing his way on and sat down.
A dispute arose. A call was made to Pukch'ŏng. The reply from Pukch'ŏng clearly stated via phone that although it was full, there was one child, so Mr. Pak (朴先生) (the reporter) alone could be taken. So, without hesitation, I got on. The Japanese man, filled with rage, made another phone call. At this time, three Japanese women who had boarded from Pukch'ŏng unanimously supported the Japanese man. Eventually, these words came out:
"ヨホサンハノラナクテモイイシヤナイカ" (Yohosan [derogatory term for Korean] wa noranakutemo ii janai ka - It's fine if the Korean doesn't ride, isn't it?) Ah—What utter humiliation! What more could be said to such people (년놈들)? At that moment, I pretended not to hear. Tears threatened to fall. When hearing such words between right and wrong from these people,<117> rather than thinking of fighting them, I just wanted to cry out, "Ah—Korean scum (朝鮮놈), I am Korean scum (朝鮮놈)." Thoughts of other brethren also arose. Furthermore, thoughts of farming brethren, border region brethren, ignorant brethren, all Korean brethren—came to mind. The kind of treatment I was enduring, similar treatment, worse treatment, even worse treatment appeared vividly before my eyes. I remembered hearing a Japanese child at Pokkye Station (福溪驛) last year say, "ヨホサンカニトウニノシタヨ" (Yohosan kani tōninoshita yo - Hey Korean, move your butt!). That memory also surfaced. Anger welled up, almost suffocating me. What could I do? A worthless Korean (못난놈 朝鮮놈). What use would it be to win a single word or punch on the spot? Endure it, just endure it꾹 참어라, I told myself. Will the authorities (當局者) not cause trouble again for saying this? (In the end, due to illegal boarding beyond capacity, both of us rode.) <118>

Korean Language and Clothes Receiving Contempt Everywhere
What time is there to discuss wounds on the hands and feet for someone whose neck is broken and back is bent? But in this land of Korea (朝鮮天地), could the Korean language and Korean clothes be so worthless and powerless? Even among Koreans (朝鮮놈), many are ashamed to speak Korean and view wearing Korean clothes like wearing prison garb, so what more needs to be said? Go to the County Office (郡廳), go to the Township Office (面所), go to the school (學校), ride the train or steamship, enter an inn (旅舘), even go to the barbershop or bathhouse—Korean language and Korean clothes inevitably face contempt. Could we be declining and falling into ruin like this? Go travel all over the land of Korea (朝鮮天地). See how many despicable fellows (안이꼽은 자식들) there are among Koreans who are ashamed of speaking Korean and wearing Korean clothes, and how many suffer contempt because of the Korean language and Korean clothes—There's a limit to being suffocated, but how could we be declining and falling into ruin like this? Who would have known? Is the national character (民族性) inherently like this? Or have the surrounding circumstances (四圍의 事情) just made it so? Let it be. They say the facts are the fundamental issue (根本問題). <118>

**Summary**

This travelogue details the author's observations and experiences during a trip through Hamgyŏngnam-do (South Hamgyŏng Province) in 1924. He describes the vibrant morning markets dominated by women, the unsatisfactory service in inns and restaurants, the lingering presence of traditional Confucian scholars (*changŭi*) in *topo*, and the surprising prevalence of bobbed hair among young women. The author laments the neglect of cultural heritage like the Pukch'ŏng South Gate and criticizes the perceived necessity for youth organizations to appoint numerous officials (including Japanese police and military) as advisors. The most poignant sections recount personal experiences of humiliation due to his Korean identity, particularly an incident with Japanese passengers on a bus and the general contempt faced by Koreans speaking their language and wearing traditional clothes, even among fellow Koreans, leading to a despairing reflection on the state of the nation under colonial rule. For historians, the article offers valuable firsthand insights into the socio-economic conditions (women's roles in markets, regional customs), the complex interplay between tradition and modernity (Confucian scholars vs. bobbed hair), the pervasive nature of colonial power structures (appointment of Japanese officials as advisors), and the everyday experiences of discrimination and cultural erosion faced by Koreans during the Japanese colonial period.

咸南에서 본 이꼴 저꼴
朝市場과 婦女의 꼴―旅舘과 飮食店꼴―掌議소리와 道抱꼴―
短髮處女何其多―北廳의 南大門꼴―開會劈頭問何其多―
日女에게 辱을 當하고―到處에 辱을 當하는 朝鮮말과 朝鮮옷―

朝市場과 婦女꼴
「咸鏡道 市場은 婦女의 市場」인 줄은 발서부터 아는 터이라 그닥 異常千萬은 안이엿다마는 하두 엄청나니 한번 그려 보련다.
다른 곳 市場은 5日一次開市를 하지만 咸鏡道沿海岸市場은 每日開市를 한다. 開市를 하되 全部全民이 모야 盡日盡夜로 하는 것이 안이라 大部分 婦女가 모야 午前만 보고(7時로 仝10時約3時)헤여진다. 故로 曰 朝市場이다.
자-朝市場이 열릴 때다. 나아가 求景하자. 모야든다. 四面으로 모야든다. 이고 들고 끼고 업고 우루릉우루릉 쓰러든다. 길죽한 나무 함지에 生鮮담어인 이가 第一만타. 쌀과 콩 배와 복숭아를 이고 오는 이도 만타. 닭을 끼고 鷄卵꾸럼이를 든 이도 만타. 그러나 신발 버서든 이가 第一만타. 어린애 업고 함지박인 이도 만타. 한발식 되는 紫朱안고름 粉紅것 고름이 연(鳶)발 날리듯 억개 넘어로 겨드랑이 아레로 너펄거린다.
萬場판이라 別別 장사가 다 모야 온다. 東馳西走商路에시 다른지라 美色은 업다. 발은 王발이요 손은 북구갈구리다. 머리는 쪽진 이도 잇고 트러 언즌 이도 잇다. 太半은 젓가슴을 내 노핫다.
市場에 드러섯다. 성냥통 속에 든 것 가티 꼼작달삭 몸을 뺄 수 업다. 까닥하다가는 코도 떼이고 발등도 잘리겟다. 魚場을 보자. 가재미가 第一만코 고등魚가 만코 靑魚가 만코 冬太도 잇고 굴젓도 잇고 別 이름모를＜114＞ 고기가 만타. 얼마으 무르니 「닷돈」이라 한다. 「五錢이면 싸다.」 하닛가 다시 「十錢」이라고 한다. 「싸시오」 「앙이싸우」 「아망이」 「아즈방이」 「줍세」 「올소」 「가티갑세」 「저 아망이 우리 애기 봣슴」等 別 사투리가 막 나와버러지는데 귀도 어지간이 압흐지만 알아 듯기도 퍽 어렵다. 飮食廛을 보자 수수엿이며 콩과 질이며 기장떡이며 찹쌀떡이며 왜국수며 되국수며 別別飮食이 만타. 「떡-앙이 싸자시우. 좀-싸오」 하는 이의 꼴은 젓가슴 드러내 놋코 風이 들렷는지 입좀 찍으러진 40假量의 中老婆이다. 菓實젼을 보자 林檎 사과 삶은 배 좀복숭아가 第一만타. 쌀젼도 그 모양 나무젼도 그 모양 오직 雜貨젼 뿐 산애가 만타.
그만보자. 一見萬可知로 朝市場風은 다 알앗다.
이들은 이날이 市場에서 헤여지면 村으로 팔러가고 漁場으로 사려고 가고 行賣로 도라단이지 決코 집에가서 안젓거나 눕지는 안는다. 것꼴은 좀-능글능글 해 보이지만 속 꼴은 어대가서 取치 못할 조흔 꼴이다.
咸南에 無貧富說은 이런 때문이다.

旅舘과 飮食店꼴
『旅舘生活은 北鮮에서 말도 말자』고 엇던 친구가 付託을 한다. 果然이다. 집이 지저분하거나 房이 더럽다는 말은 안이다. 밥이 낫부고 반찬이 업다는 말도 안이다.(飮食調理도 不及이 안인바는 안이지만)主人不親切 使喚不可見―이것이 問題이다. 北鮮사람이 本來 뚝뚝하다지만 旅舘主로서 對客까지 이러케 生뚝뚝은 意外千萬이엿다. 심부림군 한번을 三呼五呼而後에 야 보게되고 洗手물 하번을 七請八請而後에 엇게되니 親切不親切을 말해 무엇하랴. 如干해서야 樂天家夜雷親舊의 입으로 「千呼萬呼不出來北旅孤客難得水」의 明堂詩가 나왓스랴.
좀-親切하지 못할가(다는 안그럿켓지) 그리고 飮食店의 꼴!엇던 집이거나 鼎住밧게 빩안 찬장해 붓친 집이면 不問可知飮食店이다. 그 안에 무엇이 잇는고 하니 미리해서 싸하노은 澱粉국수 안이면 숭겁고도 냄새나는 燒酒뿐이다. 안이 또 장국도 잇다. 국수 달나면 싸하노은데에서 한사리 집어 한번 훌적 씻쳐 소여물(穀草쓴 것) 가튼 무뭇침이 서너쪽과 말나 꼿꼿한 고기서너점 노아서 준다. 그럿타. 장국도 그 式이다. 꼴이 이럿타. 그래서 점잔은 사람이거나 或-그런 사람을 가티 한사람은 반듯이 中國집으로 간다. 그놈의 집 꼴도 것꼴은 맛찬가지지만 그래도 料理法이 다르닛가―＜115＞ 좀-깨긋하고 먹음즉하게 해 보지 못할가.

掌議소리와 道袍의 꼴
咸南도 依然히 儒林世界엿다. 엇던 놈의 掌議直員 豊山을 가도 掌議直員 甲山을 가도―如干해서야 北靑故普期成會에서까지 掌議帖發賣를 數三次하얏다고하랴. 金掌議朴掌議-掌議안이면 呼名을 못하리만치 되야 잇다. 그리고 그 掌議님들은 아직도 道袍를 입고 學者님 거름을 한다. 무슨 書院 무슨 齊하고 春亭이니 秋亭이니하야 道袍風을 날니며 개고기 냄새를 풀풀 피우고 上下祭廳으로 왓다갓다하는 꼴이야말로-古物보듯 一種의 奇觀이 안임은 아니다. 이 꼴은 나도 한번 보앗거니와 그럿타고 一般 나가튼 친구들의 떠드는 말이엿다.

短髮處女何其多
서울 或 平壤가튼데는 斷髮美人이 만히 생긴다 하지만 北靑, 利原, 端川等地에는 短髮處女가 만트란 말이다. 웬 까닭인지는 모르나 그-確實한 處女 꼿 가튼 아가씨들은 熱病치른 사람 가티 머리가 모다 자라지 못햇다. 큰 處女거나 작은 아가씨거나 大體로 머리가 쟓다.
그래서 美의 方面으로 좀-섭섭하다. 쉬-處女評은 大禁物이다. 그러나 얼굴 評이 안이요 뒤로 본 머리뿐이니 別關係는 업겟지.

北靑의 南大門
北靑郡廳員은 눈깔도 업는지 그-어즈러운 南大門꼴도 안보고 지내는가 보다. 南大門을 헐엇스면 아조 깨긋이나 하지 關北大邑이라 자랑하는 自郡의 主門을 허러 놋코 三路街上에 그 조흔 村木을 그대로 放棄하야 그대로 썩여버리니 大體-웬 心思들이냐. 그러케 썩일바에는 細民에게 火木으로나 주지. 그러치도 못하겟스면 파라 公費에라도 보태지. 그도 못하겟스면 썩지 안토록 保管이라도 하지.-올치 個人의 것이 안이요 公有이닛가 各其 본체만체하는 셈이지. 所謂 北靑郡 當局者들아 그대들 責任이 무어냐 市民의 輿論에 귀도 안이 가렵드냐. 꼴하고도-

開會劈頭顧問何其多
惠山靑年會創立總會가 열닌다 하기에 祝賀兼求景兼 가보앗엇다. 開會가 되자 點名을 한다. 經過報告가 잇다.＜116＞ 規則草案報告가 잇다. 逐條可決을 한다. 規則을 通過하다놋코 顧問選擧부터 먼저 한다. 자-나온다. 顧問이 나온다. 第一次로 警察署長이 나온다. 第二次로 公普校長이 나온다. 第三次로 慈惠醫院長이 나온다. 第四次로 營林廠長이 나온다. 第五次로 憲兵分隊長이 나온다. 弟六次로 普惠面長이 나온다. 第七次로 學校組合管理員이 나온다...또 업나? 하도 만흐니 1, 2 個쯤 漏落되야도 좃타. 顧問何其多오 안이다.
쉬-國境이다 國境! 그러지 안코는 靑年會고 무어고 못한다. 實上말이지 顧問이 何關고 靑年會만 잘되면 그만이 안이랴.
惠山靑年會에 一言을 付한다. 決코 貴會를 들어 빙정거리는 酬酌은 안이다. 貴會로서는 그러지 안이치 못할 卽 속살안인 假式아나마 不得已헤서 두루 春風格을 取하는 그것을 안다. 國境에서는 靑年會를 해도 그러지 안코는 못한다는 一表微을 他地方兄弟에게 알키는 말이다.

日女에게 辱을 當하고
엇던놈은 自己가 當한 辱은 슬적 감춘다드라마는 나는 말해 두겟다. 同化主義者들이 드르면 입이 실룩해질넌지 모르나 大體로 日本년놈은 此處에 排斥을 안밧고는 못백일 餘裕업는 섬나라 民族이라고 안이 할 수 업다. 바로 新浦서 當한 일이다. 그 前날 北靑서 咸興까지 自動車票를 내인 나는 新浦내려서 볼일을 보고 이날은 꼭 가기로 미리 約束해 두엇든 터이다. 엇던 日本人하나도 亦 나와 비슷한 事情으로 가티 타려고 하얏다. 그는 나보다 하루 들 묵엇다. 그러나 約束과는 틀렷다. 北靑서부터 滿員이 되야 왓다. 둘이 다 못타게 되얏다. 自動車部의 無信用을 責한들 임의 滿員인 바에 奈何오 不得已 步行안이면 하루 더 묵게 되얏다. 나는 멍하고 섯섯다. 日人은 滿員임도 不拘하고 期於히 비비대고 올나 안는다.
是非가 생겻다. 北靑으로 電話질을 한다. 北靑으로의 答이 滿員이나 小兒1名이 잇스니 朴先生(記者) 한 분 뿐은 태워가라고 分明히 電話가 온다. 그래서 서슴업시 나는 올나 탓다. 日人은 골이 萬丈이나 나서 다시 電話질을 한다. 이때에 北靑으로부터 타고온 日女3名은 擧口一致로 日人을 後授한다. 맛츰내 이런 말이 나온다.
「ヨホサンハノラナクテモイイシヤナイカ」 라고 아-昌皮莫甚이지 년놈들과 다시 말해 무엇하랴. 이때 나는 드른 체 못드른 체 햇다. 눈물이 쏘다지려 햇다. 년놈들에게 是非曲直間 이런 말을 듯게 될 때에 그런＜117＞ 년놈들과 싸우는 생각보다 먼저 「아- 朝鮮놈 나는 朝鮮놈」하고 그냥 울고만 십헛다. 다른 兄弟들의 생각도 겹쳐 나왓다. 더군다나 農村兄弟 國境兄弟無識한 兄弟 全朝鮮兄弟가 다-생각낫다. 내가 當하는 이 꼴과 가튼 꼴 그 以上의 꼴 더 以上의 꼴이 눈에 환하게 보엿다. 나는 昨年이 때 福溪驛에서 엇던 日本兒童에게 「ヨホサンカニトウニノシタヨ」 소리를 드른 적도 잇다. 그 생각도 나온다. 가슴이 맥키리 만치 忿怒가 떠오른다. 엇지하랴. 못난놈 朝鮮놈이. 一言一拳이나 當場이기면 무엇이 所用이랴. 참어라 꾹 참어라 하얏슬 뿐이다. 當局者들은 이 말헷다고 또 便力이나 안이 할넌지?(結局滿員以上不法乘으로 둘이 다 타고 왓다)＜118＞

到處에 恥辱밧는 朝鮮말 朝鮮옷
목아지가 부러지고 허리가 꺽거진 놈에게 手足의 傷處를 何暇에 論하랴마는 朝鮮天地에 잇서 朝鮮말과 朝鮮옷이 이러케도 無價値 無能力하드란 말이냐. 朝鮮놈치고도 朝鮮말 하기를 붓그러워하고 朝鮮옷 입기를 罪囚옷 가티 보니 말을 더 해 무엇하랴. 郡廳에를 가도 面所에를 가도 學校에를 가도 汽車汽船을 타도 旅舘에 드러도 甚之於 理髮所 沐浴湯에를 가도 朝鮮말 朝鮮옷은 恥辱을 當하고야 말게되니 요러케도 亡해 들어가는 수도 잇슬가. 朝鮮天地에 다 다녀보라. 朝鮮놈으로 朝鮮말 朝鮮옷 하기를 붓그러워하는 안이꼽은 자식들이 얼마나 만흐며 또 朝鮮달 朝鮮옷 때문에 恥辱當하는 者는 얼마나 만흔가를-氣가 막켜도 分數가 잇지 요러케도 亡해 들어 갈줄이야. 누가 알앗스랴. 民族性이 本來 그런지? 四圍의 事情이 그러케만 되얏는지? 두어라. 事實은 根本問題라 한다.＜118＞
