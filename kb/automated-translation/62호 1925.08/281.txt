△△They say Japan (日本) will perish by fire (火); is Chosŏn (朝鮮) then destined to perish by water (水)? What fate is this? Why year after year does this dreadful fiend called flood torment the people of Chosŏn so unbearably? Let alone past events, the tragic calamity of this great flood that has struck all of Chosŏn this year, this month, this day is truly hard to describe fully with brush and tongue.

△A great flood unprecedented in Kyŏngsŏng (京城)! Along the Naktonggang (洛東江) area, a great inundation unbearable to witness! In the Hwanghae-do (黃海道) area, again a great submersion! Facing such disastrous changes, in this state where tens of thousands of lives are in turmoil, at this peak moment when life and death are undecided, still, seeing it as a responsibility taken on, I have picked up my pen and struggled to edit this.

△What can be done about the irresistible force of nature! Inevitably, we have no choice but to consider this also a trial. That is how it must be! Because we cannot just die! We must strive to do the work we have been doing, and we must also keep at the work we intend to do in the future to survive. We have no choice but to resolve to read even one more line of a book.

△As it is a hot, sweaty, and dreary time, we decided to edit this as a Cooling-off Issue (納凉號). However, unfortunately, the chance for cooling off does not come to us. In this turbulent situation, even if it is a Cooling-off Issue, what cooling off can there be? If there is a Heaven, we can only resent Heaven.

△Because the times are so painful, lonely, and bitter, there are ever more people who think deeply. We miss all the brethren residing overseas. We especially miss all the seniors residing overseas. Thus, we decided to seek out the friends of the teachers residing domestically and ask for news of those teachers. Are they in good health? Are minor affairs proceeding as they wish? What are the teachers' appearances and personalities like? We decided to learn about each other by reading this journal.

△Brother Tong Sangch'an (東相瓚), who is in the midst of surveying Chŏnnam (全南) – is he, by chance, healthy? There was a letter from Sunch'ŏn (順天), but as the Rain God's mischief is so severe, we are extremely worried. We ask once again for the kind support of the people of Chŏllanam-do.

**Summary**

This editorial postscript from the August 1925 issue of *Kaebyŏk* magazine vividly describes the devastation caused by the massive floods (later known as the Eulchuk Great Flood) that struck Korea, particularly Seoul, the Nakdong River basin, and Hwanghae Province. The editor expresses profound despair and questions fate, lamenting the recurring nature of floods in Korea. Amidst the chaos and suffering, the editor conveys a sense of duty to continue publishing the magazine, even finding bitter irony in preparing a "Cooling-off Issue" during such a disaster. The piece ends with a poignant expression of longing for compatriots and intellectual leaders, both overseas and within Korea, specifically mentioning concern for a colleague surveying the flooded Chŏllanam-do region. For historians, the article offers a raw, contemporary glimpse into the lived experience of Koreans facing a major natural disaster under colonial rule. It reveals the emotional toll, the struggle to maintain intellectual and cultural activities against overwhelming odds, and the sense of shared suffering and solidarity among Koreans, including those abroad or in remote regions. The direct address to Heaven and the comparison to Japan's prophesied fate subtly underscore the feeling of powerlessness and perhaps a critique of their circumstances.
