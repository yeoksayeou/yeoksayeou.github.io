There are truly strange things happening in the world. There are fake employees and fake reporters who forge this company's business cards (名啣) and commit financial fraud (財金詐取) and act as spies (密探) for political criminals. These individuals appear not only within Korea (朝鮮) but also emerge far overseas. Our company is endeavoring to prevent this harm as much as possible, but we ask all you brothers to also be vigilant together, and if you encounter such suspicious circumstances, please inquire immediately by sending a letter marked "Confidential" (「親展」) to this company's General Affairs Department.

Kaebyok Company, General Affairs Department <82>

**Summary**

This brief announcement from the Kaebyok Company's General Affairs Department warns readers about individuals impersonating company employees and reporters. These impostors use forged business cards to commit financial fraud and act as spies, operating both within Korea and abroad. The company urges readers to be cautious and report any suspicious individuals directly to the General Affairs Department via confidential mail. For historians, this notice is interesting as it highlights the atmosphere of suspicion and potential surveillance during the colonial period. The mention of fake reporters involved in spying points to the dangers faced by legitimate journalists and intellectuals associated with nationalist publications like *Kaebyŏk*, suggesting that authorities or other groups might use such tactics for intelligence gathering or disruption.
