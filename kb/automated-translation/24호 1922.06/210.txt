Talent/Cleverness
						Myŏngsun Yŏsa

Mother speaks,
"Oh child who does not sleep,
What makes you so happy?"

"Oh, Mother,
My light (光明)
Shines upon the whole world."

"Heh heh, that child,
Not sleeping,
Just showing off your talent (才弄)?"

"Mother, you speak of old tales.
Even in ancient times,
Were there ones like me?"

"There are no stories left,"
My daughter drains me
Of my story-pouch every evening (每 저녁).<30>

**Summary**

This short poem presents a dialogue between a mother and her young daughter who refuses to sleep. The daughter claims her inner "light" shines on the world, which the mother playfully dismisses as childish cleverness or talent (才弄). The daughter then asks if others like her existed long ago, prompting the mother to lament how the child exhausts her repertoire of stories each night. From a historical perspective, the poem, written by a female author in 1922 during the Japanese colonial period, could be interpreted symbolically. The child's "light" and assertion might represent nascent hope, potential, or even a budding national consciousness for the future generation, contrasting with the weary resignation of the older generation (the mother). The use of "才弄" is interesting, capturing both childish playfulness and perhaps unrecognized potential.
