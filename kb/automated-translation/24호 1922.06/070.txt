The Birth and Origins of the Koryŏ East China Student Federation
Kang Pin, Fudan University, Shanghai

We students abroad! Having jumped out of the warm paradise of home, bid farewell to our affectionate homeland, and far away in a foreign land where customs and sentiments are peculiar and language and manners are different, under the cold lamp of the study window, we struggle towards even unseen goals! Ah, pitifully, the affection of parents, wives, and children, the friendship of brothers and sisters, all embraces of love can only be sought again from close friends. Therefore, we naturally think of uniting with our many affectionate companions, and in forming a union, the desperate longing for the complete unity of those with the same blood and ethnicity, rather than strangers we have never met, is a pure and innocent instinct, a fact that cannot be criticized.

Our students studying in China, too, for over 10 years, like scattered mercury trying to recombine, have endlessly toiled to unite with each other. However, at that time, the number was so few as to be countable on one's fingers. Moreover, some were in Peking, some in Nanking, the distance being too great, so they could never achieve their goal and always lived in regret. Finally, with the increase of students abroad following social trends, the Shanghai Student Association (留滬學生會) was organized, albeit locally at first, in Shanghai. Around the same time, the Nanking Friendship Association (南京學友會) in Nanking, the Soochow Fellow Students Association (留吳同學會) in Soochow, and the Peking Koryŏ Student Association (留北京高麗學生會) in Peking were each organized. However, this alone could not satisfy the earnest driving force for complete unity, craving the affection of close friends. Indeed, the local scope gave no small sense of the frustrating feeling of scratching an itch through clothes. Thus, the All-China Koryŏ Student Association was conceived under the initiative of the Shanghai Student Association and the Nanking Friendship Association; this was the summer of the year before last<54>. Then, one year later, last July, despite the scorching heat, it was finally born into this world under the name Koryŏ East China Student Federation (高麗華東留學生聯合會).

Our East China Student Federation, with its fresh history, is located in Shanghai under the beautiful objectives of promoting friendship, mutual respect, and the advancement of knowledge. It is organized by Koryŏ students studying in the provinces of Kiangsu, Anhui, Hupeh, Chekiang, Kiangsi, etc. The number of members who joined at the 1st General Assembly was approximately 130, and the elected officers are as follows:
Executive Committee: President Chŏng Kwangho, Vice President T'ak Myŏngsuk
Treasurer Kang Pin, Secretary Kim Chu
Investigator Pak Ch'anyŏng
Legislative Committee: Chairman Kim Sŏnnyang, Members Chu Yohan, Yi Kanghŭi, Ch'oe Chihwa, An Wŏnsaeng

Though modest, our association's past activities include performing an amateur play titled *Yamiang* (夜未央 - Night Not Yet Over) in early September last year to console our nation's struggling young heroes (風雲兒) in Shanghai. Later, in October, we dispatched Messrs. Chŏng Kwangho and Kim Sangdŏk to the Far Eastern Congress of Oppressed Peoples held in the Russian capital (露都). We also sent Mr. Chu Yohan to the World Student Christian Federation conference held nearby in Peking. Besides these, we have many times wished and planned for the arrival of opportunities and the feasibility of travel to visit the long-missed homeland we yearn for. However, pitiful is our nation, and unfeeling is society. Travel expenses and other surrounding circumstances have hitherto prevented us from achieving our long-cherished desire.

Finally, I earnestly request of all brothers and sisters who aspire to study: I sincerely urge you to come study in large numbers in China, our sole future stage of activity. We too, though our strength is weak, intend to do our utmost with sincerity and devotion for the sake of future students. I add that tuition fees are very low. (End)

**Summary**

This article reports on the formation of the Koryŏ East China Student Federation (高麗華東留學生聯合會) in Shanghai in July 1921. Penned by Kang Pin of Fudan University, it describes the initial difficulties faced by Korean students in China due to small numbers and geographical separation, leading to the formation of local student groups in Shanghai, Nanking, Soochow, and Peking. Driven by a desire for greater unity and mutual support among fellow Koreans ("同血同族"), these groups initiated the establishment of the larger federation encompassing students in Kiangsu, Anhui, Hupeh, Chekiang, and Kiangsi provinces. The article lists the first elected officers and mentions activities like staging a play, sending representatives to the Far Eastern Congress of Oppressed Peoples in Moscow and the World Student Christian Federation conference in Peking, and the unfulfilled desire to visit Korea due to financial constraints. It concludes with an appeal for more Korean students to study in China.

From a historical perspective, the article is interesting as it reveals the growing organizational efforts and nationalist consciousness among Korean students abroad during the early colonial period. The emphasis on "complete unity of those with the same blood and ethnicity" (同血同族의 一圓團合) and the reference to students as "our nation's struggling young heroes" (我邦의 風雲兒) highlight the strong sense of shared identity and purpose. The federation's international engagement, sending delegates to conferences alongside other "oppressed peoples," indicates an awareness of and participation in broader anti-colonial movements. The lament about the inability to visit the homeland due to financial hardship also underscores the practical difficulties faced by these students. Historians might find the specific names, locations, organizational structure, and activities valuable for understanding the networks and political leanings of the Korean diaspora intelligentsia in China in the early 1920s.
