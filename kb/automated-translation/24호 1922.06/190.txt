蠱惑
						明淳 女史
Lover of the dreamland,
Now, to the sweet song not of this world,
I have lent my quietly sleeping ear.

How free a melody it must be!
My body, purified, grows wings
And would fly through the flowering space.

Even if we lament the fleeting world (浮世), you and I,
I did not walk the main road (大路) before me,
And you did not seek the cave (洞窟) before you.

But the song liberating us
Who were oppressed is heard,
So let us abandon the dream path.

Lover, oh, lover!
Here on the path of the mysterious realm (幽玄境),
There is a way, so please come this way.<29>

Lover, oh, lover!
In that place unknown to people,
There is a way, so spread your wings.<30>
<29-30>

**Summary**

The poem initially expresses a yearning for escape with a lover into a dream world, evoked by a "sweet song not of this world." The speaker imagines a purified self flying freely. However, it shifts tone, acknowledging past inaction ("did not walk the main road," "did not seek the cave") and responding to a "song liberating us who were oppressed." The conclusion is a call to abandon the dream path and instead follow a real, albeit mysterious ("unknown to people"), path towards liberation. From a historical perspective, the poem is interesting as it's penned by a woman ("Yŏsa" indicating a female writer) in early colonial Korea. The themes of oppression, escapism versus liberation, and finding a hidden path could reflect the socio-political climate and the nascent desire for agency and freedom under Japanese rule. Historians might find the blend of romantic yearning with a call for awakening and action significant, especially coming from a female voice during this period.

蠱惑
						明淳 女史
꿈나라의 愛人이시어
只今 이 세상안닌 甘美의 노래에
고요히 잠든 귀를 기울엿나이다

얼마나 自由로운 調律이오리까
몸은 淨化되어 날개를 달고
꼿피운 空間을 날으려나이다

浮世를 운들 그대와 나
내 압헤 大路를 것지안코
그대 압헤 洞窟을 찻지안핫도다

그러나 눌리엇든 우리들을
解放하는 노래가 들려지오니
우리는 꿈길을 버립시다

愛人이시어 愛人이시어
여긔 幽玄境의 길에
길이 잇스니 이리 오십쇼＜29＞

愛人이시어 愛人이시어
사람 모르는 그 곳에
길 잇스니 날개를 펴십쇼.＜30＞
＜29-30＞
