嗚呼孫義菴先生
						起瀍

Alas! At 3:00 AM on May 19th in the summer of the Im-sul year (1922), the great man Master Son Ŭiam departed this world forever.

As the news of the Master's passing spread through the world, the patriots of the age mourned for him, and the people of the land wept for him. The achievements of the Master's entire life can indeed be proven by this.

Alas! The Master was a giant of the people. His birth was of the people, his actions were for the people, and his death was also of the people. Thus, the history of the Master's lifelong efforts and struggles, a history of popular activity, truly aligned its transformations with ghosts and spirits and manipulated its changes along with the wind and clouds. Is he the phoenix of the morning sun? Is he the dragon amidst the clouds? The more we look up, the higher he seems; the more we delve, the firmer he appears. Is it not, therefore, the natural course of things that the people of the land weep and mourn for him?

In essence, if one were to summarize the Master's lifelong activities in a single phrase, he was thoroughly a great man, a pioneer. He made it his principle and purpose to forge paths in all directions for the happiness of the people. Having risen from humble beginnings, he personally tasted the hardships of the people, possessing much discipline. Having established his will in righteousness, he personally embodied the demands of the people, possessing much experience. Having committed his actions to effort, he personally strove for the development of the people, possessing many accomplishments. The Master's sole spiritual focus was on spreading virtue throughout the land and broadly saving the masses.

The three great activities in the Master's life, which he could never forget, are known to all the world. First was the Kabo Reform (甲午革新); the Master<2> raised the flag of righteousness together with hundreds of thousands of people to rescue the society of the time from corruption. Second was the Kapchin Enlightenment (甲辰開化); after the failure of Kabo, the Master endured hardships in foreign lands for ten years, then seized the opportunity in the Kapchin year (1905) to ring the bell of enlightenment with a million people. Third were his final years (最後의 晩節); for the last 20 years, the Master deeply realized that the enlightenment of Chosŏn lay in cultural promotion and thus exhausted his mind and poured out his heart's strength, sometimes through reform activities, sometimes through organizing the church (敎會 - Ch'ŏndogyo), sometimes through spreading education, and sometimes through other teachings to break heterodoxy and reveal righteousness (破邪顯正). His spiritual focus was such, and his utmost sincerity was such; is it not therefore natural that the people of the land weep and mourn for him?

Alas! The Master was the light of the nation (民族). It can be said that the Chosŏn nation, by having the Master, achieved ethnic cohesion for the first time and commenced organized activity. If the prosperity of a nation is proven by the existence of a great leader within that nation, then the Master's presence among the Chosŏn people was certainly not accidental, and at the same time, it is our eternal glory.

Alas! The Master is no longer a person of this world. When we mourn and weep for the Master, what kind of mindset (心法) is it most true to uphold? The Master often said during his lifetime that the spirit (精靈) of a person after death undergoes "spiritual emergence" (性靈出世). "Spiritual emergence" means that a person's spirit, after death, merges permanently with the social spirit and actively works within our spirit in the unseen realm (冥冥의 裡). From this perspective, the Master's spirit, I believe, will become the light of the great stars in heaven, the beauty of the great earth's mountains and rivers, and indeed the spirit of the social populace, evolving forever with the wondrous law of nature (自然妙法) and existing eternally with the people's spirit (民衆의 心法). Although the Master has died in the flesh, he lives on in spirit and through his works. In the unseen realm, we can encounter the Master's spiritual countenance and bathe in his spiritual light. It is even more fitting for our people to uphold this principle as we mourn and weep over the Master's misfortune, and furthermore, thoroughly embodying the Master's unique spiritual focus (特殊한 心法) – this, I believe, is true mourning and true weeping.<3>

**Summary**

This article is a deeply felt eulogy for Son Pyŏnghŭi (Son Ŭiam), the third leader of Ch'ŏndogyo, written shortly after his death in May 1922 by Ki Ch'an (likely Ch'oe Rin). The author portrays Son as a "giant of the people," a "pioneer," and the "light of the nation," whose entire life was dedicated to the masses. It highlights three major phases of his activism: the 1894 Donghak Peasant Revolution (Kabo Reform), the 1905 reorganization of Donghak into Ch'ŏndogyo (Kapchin Enlightenment), and his later focus on cultural and educational development. The eulogy concludes by emphasizing Son's concept of "spiritual emergence" after death, suggesting his spirit lives on within the collective consciousness and nature itself. For historians, this piece offers insight into how a major religious and nationalist figure like Son Pyŏnghŭi was viewed and venerated by his followers (specifically within Ch'ŏndogyo circles) during the colonial period. It frames his actions, including the Donghak uprising, not just as religious but as populist movements for the "people's happiness" and "national cohesion," reflecting the intertwined nature of religion and nationalism in early 20th-century Korea.

嗚呼孫義菴先生
						起瀍
歲壬戌夏 5月 19日 上午 3時에 偉人 孫義菴先生은 永遠히 이 世上을 떠낫도다.
先生 別世의 訃音이 한번 世上에 傳하매 當代의 志士-爲하야 吊하며 天下의 民衆이 爲하야 哭하니 先生의 一生功業은 能히 此로써 證明하리로다.
嗚呼 先生은 民衆의 巨人이니 그 生함이 民衆的이엇스며 그 爲함이 民衆的이엇스며 또 그 死함이 民衆的이엇고 그리하야 先生 一生의 努力 奮鬪한 民衆的 活動史는 實로 鬼神으로 더블어 그 變化를 合하며 風雲과 한가지로 그 變態를 操縱하엿는지라. 朝陽의 鳳이냐 雲中의 龍이냐 吾人은 仰할스록 더욱 高하며 鑽할스록 더욱 堅함을 覺치 못하리로소니 天下의 民衆이 爲하야 哭하며 吊함이 또한 固然의 理勢가 아닌가.
大槪 先生의 一生活動을 一言으로써 此를 約하면 그는 徹頭徹尾 開拓者의 偉人이니 그는 民衆의 幸福을 爲하야 모든 方面을 開拓함으로써 그 主義와 目的을 삼아왓도다. 身이 微賤에  起하야 民衆의 艱苦를 몸소 맛본 바 鍜鍊이 만흐며 志를 正義에 立하야 民衆의 要求를 몸소 體認한 바 經驗이 만흐며 行을 努力에 致하야 民衆의 開發을 몸소 奮鬪한 바 事實이 多하엿나니 先生의 心法은 오로지 德을 天下에 펴며 널리 蒼生을 건짐에 잇섯도다.
先生의 一生에 잇서 가장 잇지 못할 3大 活動은 天下가 共知하는 배라. 첫재는 甲午革新이니 先生은＜2＞ 當時 社會의 腐敗를 拯濟키 爲하야 數十萬의 民衆과 한가지로 正義의 旗를 擧하엿슴이 其一이며 둘재는 甲辰開化니 先生은 甲午失敗 後-10年間 萬里異域에 風餐露宿하다가 甲辰의 機會를 際하야 百萬의 民衆으로 더블어 開化의 鍾을 鳴하엿슴이 其二이며 셋재는 最後의 晩節이니 先生은 伊來 20年間-朝鮮의 啓發은 文化振興에 在함을 洞覺하고 或은 革新의 活動으로 或은  敎會의 組織으로 或은 敎育의 普及으로 或은 其他 破邪顯正의 敎訓으로 腦漿을 渴하고 心力을 盡하엿는지라. 그의 心法이 그만하며 그의 至誠이 그만하엿거니 天下의 民衆이 爲하야 哭하며 吊함이 또한 當然치 아니한가.
嗚呼 先生은 民族의 光이니 朝鮮民族은 先生을 得하야 처음으로 民族的 結合을 지엇스며 組織的 活動을 開始하엿도다 할지라. 萬若 一民族의 繁榮이 그 民族 中 偉大한 指導者의 存在로써 證明한다 하면 朝鮮民族의 中에 先生이 有함이 決코 偶然한 일이 아닌 同時에 또한 우리의 永遠한 光榮이로다.
嗚呼 先生은 어느덧 此世의 人이 아니니 吾人은 先生을 吊하며 哭함에 何等의 心法을 把持함이 가장 진리일가. 先生在世의 時에 恒言하사대 人類의 死後 精靈은 「性靈出世」라 하엿나니 「性靈出世」라 함은 人의 精靈은 死後에 永久히 社會的 精神과 融合하야 冥冥의 裡에 吾人精神 內에서 活躍한다 함이라. 이 点에서 先生의 精靈은 생각건대 大天星辰의 光이 되며 大地山河의 美가 되며 抑亦 社會民衆의 精神이 되어 自然妙法으로 더블어 永久히 進化하며 民衆의 心法으로 더블어 恒久히 存在할 것이라. 先生은 비록 肉으로써 死하엿스나 靈으로써 生하엿스며 事業으로써 生하엿거니 吾人은 暗暗의 裡에서 先生의 靈的 面目을 接觸할 수 잇스며 先生의 靈的 光明에 浴함을 可得할지라. 우리의 民衆이 此 原理를 把持하야써 先生의 不幸을 吊하며 哭함이 一層-當然하며 그리하야 나아가 先生의 特殊한 心法을 徹底히 體得함이 이 實로 眞의 吊이며 眞의 哭일가 하노라.＜3＞
