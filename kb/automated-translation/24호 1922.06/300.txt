Notice

The articles scheduled for continuation in this issue:
From the "Student Forum" section, "The Korean Labor Problem Viewed from the General Trend of the Labor Movement" by Yi Yŏnghan of P'yŏngyang Sungdae [Soongsil University].
"Coal and Iron" by Yang Chae-sun of Kongjŏn [Technical College].

Due to editorial circumstances (編輯上 形便), these have been postponed for publication in the upcoming July issue.<54>

**Summary**

This is a brief editorial notice from *Kaebyŏk* magazine announcing the postponement of two articles originally scheduled for the June 1922 issue (No. 24) until the July issue. The delayed articles are "The Korean Labor Problem Viewed from the General Trend of the Labor Movement" by Yi Yŏnghan and "Coal and Iron" by Yang Chae-sun. The reason cited is "editorial circumstances." For historians, this notice is interesting as it highlights the magazine's engagement with contemporary social issues like the labor movement and industrial resources (coal, iron) during the colonial period. The unspecified "editorial circumstances" could hint at various pressures, including potential censorship or simple logistical issues faced by publishers at the time.
