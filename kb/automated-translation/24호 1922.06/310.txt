From the Editorial Office

Though we cannot state the reasons, we were especially busy (奔忙) with the editing of this June issue. We were so busy we could hardly get our bearings (頭緖). This issue, produced amid such busyness, likely has many rough spots (엉성한 點). Please overlook them.

Our upcoming 25th issue, to be published on July 1st, will be the 2nd Anniversary Commemorative Issue (Enlarged Issue) (記念號(增大號)) of this magazine (本誌). Considering various points, we have decided to make it a record worthy of a commemorative issue, so please be aware of this.

Also, one more thing to mention concerns Yi Ch'unwŏn's (李春園) "Theory of National Reconstruction" (民族改造論), published (揭載) in the May issue of this magazine. We merely offered it up on the altar (俎上) for criticism (批判) by the general public (一般民衆), as we felt that this "National Reconstruction" itself was something worth discussing (論議) at least once. The nature of the criticism regarding it is entirely entrusted (一任) to the discerning eyes (公眼) of you, the wise members of society (賢明한 社會 여러분).<54>

**Summary**

The editorial note from the June 1922 issue of *Kaebyŏk* apologizes for potential flaws due to a hectic editing process and announces an enlarged 2nd-anniversary issue for July. It also addresses the publication of Yi Ch'unwŏn's "Theory of National Reconstruction" in the previous issue, explaining it was presented to stimulate public debate and discussion, leaving the final judgment to the readers. For historians, this piece reveals the operational challenges faced by Korean publications during the colonial period and illustrates the magazine's cautious yet committed role in fostering public discourse on potentially sensitive national issues, framing controversial topics like "National Reconstruction" as subjects for societal deliberation rather than explicitly endorsing them.

編輯室로부터
그 까닭은 말슴할 것이 업사오나 이번 6月號의 編輯에는 別로 奔忙하엿습니다. 거의 頭緖를 차리지 못하리 만큼 奔忙하엿습니다. 이와 가튼 奔忙 中에 産出된 本號는 엉성한 點이 別로 만흘 것이입니다. 눌러 보아주십시오.

돌아오는 7月 1日로써 發行할 25號의 本誌는 本誌創刊 2週年 記念號(增大號)가 되겟습니다. 여러 가지의 點으로 생각하야 한번 紀念號다운 記錄을 나이게 되엇사오니 그리 알아주십시오.

그리고 다시 한말슴 하을 것은 本誌의 5月號에 揭載된 李春園의 「民族改造論」에 對한 것이외다. 우리는 다못 民族改造라는 그것이 如何間 1次 論議할 거리가 딈과 가틈으로 이를 一般民衆의 批判의 俎上에 供한 것 뿐이온 바 이에 對한 批判의 如何는 오즉 賢明한 社會 여러분의 公眼에 一任할 뿐이외다.＜54＞
