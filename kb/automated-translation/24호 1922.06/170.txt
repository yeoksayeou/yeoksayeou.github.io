A Historical Study of Korean Art
						Pak Chonghong
Chapter 2: Ancient Times
Section 1: Investigation of Ancient Art

Since ancient times in the East, the Six Arts (六藝) were referred to as Rites (禮), Music (樂), Archery (射), Charioteering (御), Calligraphy (書), and Mathematics (數). Even things like hunting (狩獵), farming (耕作), medicine (醫術), and divination (卜筮) were included in what was called art (藝術), similar to the broadest interpretation of the English word "Art." Particularly beyond that, the concept of fine art (美術) (Art not interpreted broadly, i.e., Fine Art) did not exist. Even in that vast and unfounded primordial chaos (鴻濛無據), those arts—

"Set your will on the Way (道), hold fast to Virtue (德), rely on Benevolence (仁), roam in the Arts (藝)."
—though called "roaming in the Arts" (遊於藝), were something that even those who set their will on the Way could not disregard; yet, it was specifically stated that one "roams" (遊) in them.

"Art (藝) is something that even scholars committed to the Way cannot forget, yet it is merely something to roam in. Painting is also an art." (Song Dynasty, Xuanhe Painting Catalogue - 宋宣和畫譜)

Ultimately, it is clearly argued that fine art was nothing more than a secondary pursuit (餘技) for scholar-gentlemen (士君子). There might be some stubborn Han scholars (漢學者輩) who would allow for counterarguments, objecting that reaching the Way and Virtue comes through mastering the Six Arts. However, this certainly does not refute the previous statement. This does not elevate the value of fine art or make it more esteemed. (Of course, it's not as if they specifically estimate the value of fine art in such a manner.)<15>

That is, as long as its purpose lies in morality (道德), it becomes merely fine art that serves as one means of fostering ethics (倫理). Viewing it this way also self-evidences that morality—the foundation for cultivating oneself (修身), regulating the family (齊家), governing the state (治國), and bringing peace to the world (平天下)—was regarded as the supreme treasure, while things like fine art were considered nothing more than a means to achieve their goal, leading to the creation of only servile art dedicated to ethics.

Therefore, only after cultivating oneself and achieving virtue should one begin to appreciate (翫好) this.

"When virtue is achieved, one art follows; this is not damaging the root to pursue the branches."

If one specialized in roaming in the arts from the beginning, this too was considered damaging the root (本) and pursuing the branches (末) and was not endorsed. Even a master craftsman (名匠), if his character conflicted with morality (especially formal morality), was not highly regarded. Conversely, even a common artisan (凡工), if his personality was outstanding, might have his skills passed down in the art world (藝苑).

"Ancient paintings are all for admonition and warning." (History of Painting - 畫史)

"Painting serves to cultivate refinement, aid human relations, explore divine transformations, and fathom the subtle and profound." (Record of Famous Paintings - 名畫記)

This represents a partial, straightforward ideal regarding painting, but extending this, it can also be considered the general view of fine art. It shows that the function of fine art was primarily focused on promoting virtue and chastising vice (勸善懲惡), while things like aesthetic appreciation (審美的 鑑賞) belonged rather to secondary matters.

Thus, the demand for fine art returned to utilitarian (功利上) purposes; if it wasn't art for morality, then what about art for past historical events, i.e., history (歷史)?

Therefore, it was the common practice since ancient times = (especially reaching the Yi Dynasty - 李朝) = for painters (환쟁이), sculptors (彫刻쟁이), carpenters/architects (木手쟁이), blacksmiths/metallurgists (대장쟁이), etc., generally referred to with the suffix "-chaengi" (쟁이) by the common folk (not worth elaborating on), and even among the supposedly intelligent scholar-gentlemen, to often look down upon it. This is markedly different in trend from European art, which gradually approached purely free aesthetic creation, even shedding the shackles (覇絆) of supposedly lofty subjects like religion and history, and furthermore, gained recognition for its independent status and value through the diligent research of modern aestheticians.

Therefore, even if great geniuses, master artists, roamed in this garden, or if there were those who truly appreciated art with a purely aesthetic sentiment, suppose they had inherently transcended the ordinary constraints of this world from the beginning and uniquely possessed their own special realm within it<16>, when discussing the general societal treatment of the artist's status, it is utterly incomparable to that in Europe.

Moreover, how much more so when there are those所谓的 artists who, setting aside becoming slaves to (formal) morality, consider creating works for food and clothing as their ideal and satisfaction, residing in extreme humility? This only serves to insult art.

Even if this is the modern person's view of art, inferring from this, the preservation of artworks and the like would likely not even have been dreamt of.

Our art, which has been transmitted and grown within this context, moreover, the ancient art whose living conditions were still unavoidable primitive, which is the subject here—the scrutiny (穿鑿) of the faint relics occasionally discovered—rather belongs to the realm of archaeology (考古學).

As long as the relationship with that era and the mutual connections and changes (變天 - likely means 變遷, vicissitudes/changes) are unclear, it is not something that one discussing art history can properly investigate. Therefore, in collecting and arranging the remaining treasures, comparing and generalizing them, searching and verifying historical materials, and organizing them, there is still the suspicion that starting the discussion from the Three Kingdoms period is appropriate. However, since it is already called history (史), meaning a record of development, relying on the historical traces that changed and shifted along with the times, some explanation regarding the reasons for the changes and the causes of the shifts is also unavoidable.

What indeed was the history recorded by the Greek historian Herodotus (헤로도터스), referred to as the "Father of History" in Europe? It was not a collection of myths, nor a research paper on archaeology; he only described the history of his own time. His purpose was not to lay out myths or state archaeological facts. Discussing these was simply an inescapable necessity when tracing their origins in relation to that era. It is acceptable not to find fault with this; rather, it serves as a resource to gauge the extent of his mental labor. That is, just because it is young and immature, how can these works of ancient times, which are the ancestors of later art, be treated lightly?

Even before recorded history, around the 4th century BC, and even further back in the Paleolithic era, the Diluvial period (洪積期), humanity was already diligently seeking beauty. Among the cave artifacts discovered along the tributaries of the Dordogne River in southern France, there are bone fishing hooks, and many animal bones feature interesting carvings; the engraving of a herd of reindeer on the cave wall is one such example.

Also, considering that even among present-day primitive peoples who live naked, they still adorn their bodies with horns or shells, and even apply some decoration to their small huts, it can be inferred that even the ancient, uncivilized people, though appearing extremely crude and undeniably ignorant, had a vibrant desire <17> to seek beauty.

Although it is said that creation and its appreciation transcend time, the source from which it arises and originates must also be sought in this world governed by the law of cause and effect. Therefore, what is so strange about seeking its beginnings in the distant past?

Thus, the reason for naming this period the "Upper Ancient Era" (上古時代) and starting here, collecting and arranging their fragments, has come to this point.

However, Buddhism was transmitted to Chosŏn (朝鮮) in the 2nd year of King Sosurim (小獸林王) of Koguryŏ (高句麗). Thus, the preceding era was, of course, untouched by the influence of Buddhist art. Consequently, its artworks, on the one hand, were inevitably extremely crude due to the era, but on the other hand, it can be called an era where the heroic and profound innate nature of the Paedal (倍達) people was purely expressed to their heart's content. Is it not also valuable and important? Furthermore, through this diligent search and painstaking examination, although perhaps crude and lacking anything particularly praiseworthy, we can discover that elegant and noble artworks, which even we modern people find difficult to attain, were already created in the ancient times of several thousand years ago.

Section 2: Upper Ancient Period (上代)

The lack of artifacts and historical sites from that time, which serve as crucial objects and evidence for studying ancient art, poses an extraordinary difficulty in investigating this field, as already discussed in the previous chapter.

As thousands of years passed and hundreds of generations cycled, the degree of faintness and vagueness naturally increased—this can be imagined without discussion. How much more so for the primeval past, which feels like a separate world of myths, where even written records, prone to errors and lacking credibility, are hard to obtain? Truly, one cannot avoid the proliferation of points that are difficult to discern and prove. I wonder if perhaps shrinking back from this point would, conversely, reveal my own ignorance and crudeness.

Part 1: Prehistoric Period (有史前)

The prologue of Korean ethnic history begins with the Tangun (檀君) era, and not a single step beyond that is permitted. How much more so for art history, which demands objects of study? However, is there truly no room at all for further investigation beyond this? How? That is, on what <18> should one rely, and what object should be brought forth to supplement this and compare it?

Here, one cannot help but temporarily encroach upon the domain of archaeology. Artifacts from that time, such as stone tools, bone tools, and pottery, though rare, are scattered everywhere. The vast ancient ruins of our Paektu-san (白山) and the northern rivers (黑水 - likely Amnok/Yalu & Tuman/Tumen) are great relics of that age. The results of discovering these definite ruins and collecting artifacts to investigate them are not inferior in value to cultural history and ethnic history. Ruins include sites containing artifacts (包含地) and sites where they are scattered (散在地), but for systematic study, the containing sites, especially shell mounds (貝塚), are most suitable.

A shell mound refers to a pile of shells from shellfish used for food and tools made using them, accumulated by tribes residing in the Alluvial epoch (冲積期) of the Quaternary period, i.e., the Stone Age (though even today in parts of America, there are indigenous people who still create shell mounds). Within Chosŏn as well, innumerable stone tools and pottery pieces are discovered. Their shapes may vary somewhat depending on the region, but their types are all the same.

The study of shell mounds belongs to the very recent past. In Europe, Denmark (丁抹) has conducted the most detailed research, followed by Switzerland (瑞西), France (佛蘭西), England (英吉利), etc. On the east coast near Denmark, there are shell mounds reaching 3 ch'ŏk (feet) to over 1 chang (approx. 10 feet) in height, 160-170 kan (approx. 960-1020 feet) in length, and over 30 kan (approx. 180 feet) in width, forming distinct embankments. Our Chosŏn's shell mounds are similar, with the important ones mostly located on the East Sea (東海) coast, particularly abundant in the northern Chosŏn region. Examples include the Chuham shell mound (蛛堣貝塚) in Puryŏng county (富寧郡), North Hamgyŏng province (咸鏡北道), and those discovered near Iwŏn county (利原郡), South Hamgyŏng province (咸鏡南道). From shell mounds near the coast of the Russian Maritime Province (露領 沿海洲) and along the Tuman River (豆滿江) and Ussuri River (烏蘇里江) (the ancient land of East Okchŏ - 東沃沮), stone axes (石斧), stone arrowheads (石鏃), stone crossbow bolts (石弩), and other stone tools, pottery, as well as bone awls (骨錐), bone needles (骨針), horn knives (角刀), and other bone/horn implements (角骨器) and metal objects (金器類) have been excavated. Russians in that area also found numerous stone tools within these shell mounds when burning them to make white lime (白灰). Among the shell mounds discovered and somewhat studied in the southern Chosŏn region is the one located at the foot of Ponghwangdae (鳳凰臺) in Kimhae town (金海邑), South Kyŏngsang province (慶尙南道). While not particularly different from the northern shell mounds, it attracts public attention as one of Chosŏn's most important and valuable historical resources because it preserves layers containing artifacts sufficient for examining the development of the Stone Age. This shell mound is about 1 chang 5 ch'ŏk (approx. 15 feet) high, 60 kan (approx. 360 feet) long, and 20 kan (approx. 120 feet) wide, generally divisible into four layers. The upper part yields Silla-style (新羅式) pottery. Passing through a clay layer and going down gradually, numerous bone/horn implements, ironware (鐵器), and stone tools are found. Among the bone/horn implements, many handles for small knives made by cutting deer antlers (鹿角) remain, closely resembling artifacts from the Neolithic period discovered in Lake Myren (마이렌 湖) in Switzerland (瑞西國). Besides these,<19> there are also bone arrowheads (骨鏃), etc., and furthermore, remnants of corroded iron knives (鐵刀) exist, indicating the use of iron at that time. Based on this, one can infer the concurrent use of bone, horn, and iron. It is only regrettable that due to the distant age, their forms are incomplete. The lower layer also contains artifacts such as stone tools from the Paleolithic era (古石器時代).

The above is a general overview of shell mounds. Regardless of their value from an art perspective, the pottery and metal objects allow us to infer that pottery making (製陶業) and metallurgy (冶金術), etc., were already practiced in that era. Based on this, it is reasonable to observe that the people of that time, though perhaps naive and weak, expressed aesthetic inclinations.

Part 2: Post-Recorded History (有史 後)

The Tangun (檀君) era was a time when the magnificent Paedal nation (倍達國) flourished. The Ancient Chosŏn Record (古朝鮮紀) states:

"He descended beneath a sandalwood tree (檀木) on Mount T'aebaek (太白山). He pioneered the mountains and rivers, nurtured the people. On the third day of the first month of the Musin year, the 121st year [of his reign]. When he proclaimed the divine teachings (神誥) at the Yŏnggung palace (御靈宮), P'eng Wu (彭吳), leading three thousand followers, bowed his head and received them. Kosi (高矢) gathered blue stones (靑石) on the shore of the East Sea (東海). Sinji (神誌) drew on those stones to transmit them."

The Kosi ritual (高矢禮) is passed down by later generations because he pioneered the wilderness and promoted the farming of the five grains. It was the Paedal nation, abundant in gems (寶石) and jewels (珠玉). It is not surprising that jade stones (玉石) were collected on the shore of the East Sea. Sinji created writing (文字) and established moral principles (彝倫) to educate the people, thus it is said that morality first dawned in the East. Since writing already existed then, although it's difficult to guess what kind of calligraphy and painting (書畫) it was—as painting with brush and ink was invented in later ages—it seems undoubtedly true that he carved and drew (刻畫) on the surface of that jade stone to pass it down, given that calligraphy and painting began with carving and drawing on horn and stone with knives and awls (刀錐). Thus, we consider this the origin (嚆矢) of sculpture and painting in our art history, and I believe this is almost certainly not a misconception. However, this is only based on records; not being able to encounter the actual objects is endlessly lamentable.

However, it is not that there are absolutely no historical sites from the Tangun era.

"He established an altar (壇) to sacrifice to Heaven (祭天). The third was Samnang Fortress (三郞城). Later, the capital was moved to Tangjanggyŏng (唐莊京)."

This altar used for major sacrifices (祭大) is the Ch'amsŏngdan (塹城壇) (also called Chŏmsŏngdan - 瞻星壇) located on Mount Mani (摩尼山) on Kanghwa Island (江華島), about 4 ri south of the town. To the east, it offers a distant view of Mount Pukhan (北漢山), and to the west, it gathers the numerous scattered islands under one gaze—a magnificent view where words and brush fail. And Samnang Fortress (三郞城), named so because he sent his three sons (三子) to build the fortress (築城),<20> is also located on Mount Chŏndŭng (傳燈山), about 3 ri south of the town. Though it has endured countless violent storms and harsh rains over eons, the fact that its ruins still remain intact sufficiently allows us to imagine that the superior architectural techniques for building altars and fortresses, expressing the heroic spirit of the Three Kingdoms era, began from that time. Moreover, what else could this be but a manifestation of the spirit and aspirations of our Paedal people?

Section 4 [sic - should be 3? Text jumps from 2 to 4]: The Three Han Period (三韓期)
Part 1: Culture of the Three Han Period

Here, the term "Three Han Period" (三韓時代) refers to the time when the tribes descended from Tangun of our Paedal nation spread from Liaodong (遼東) in the north across the great plains of Manchuria (滿洲) lying between the northern rivers (黑水) down to the islands separated by the ocean in the south. It does not solely discuss the Three Han (三韓) confined to the southern tip. However, discussing culture under the heading of "Art History" might seem overly broad. Yet, even today, with several thousand years of history, distinct, independent artistic works are rare to count. How much more so for an era already named "ancient"? Seeking unique fine art is, of course, an immeasurable task, but we who intend to discuss history cannot possibly fail to explore the culture of that era where its promising buds and good seedlings lay dormant.

Subpart 1: Puyŏ (扶餘)
What indeed was the culture of Puyŏ, which held sway over the vast Manchurian plains, considered the homeland of the Paedal people?

"North of Puyŏ lies the Ruoshui (弱水 - Weak River). Its territory spans 2,000 li, mostly flat and open. The soil is suitable for the five grains. It was originally Yemaek (濊) land."
"The country has many mountains, hills, and broad swamps. There is an old fortress called Yemaek Fortress (濊城), likely the original land of the Yemaek (濊貊)."

This proves that the Yemaek tribes built fortresses and resided here, then spread southeast from this location. Furthermore:

"The Yemaek customs: they忌諱 disease and death. Upon death, they promptly abandon the old dwelling and build a new one."

Based on this, we know the Yemaek people had a tendency to favor migration. It becomes clear that they moved south <21> along the narrow plains east of the T'aebaek mountain range (脊梁山脈) and established Okchŏ (沃沮). Only later did the narrowest part in the southern Kangwŏn province (江原道) become almost uninhabited, serving merely to distinguish the northern and southern peoples.

In contrast, to the west, they had already moved south to Kanghwa (江華) during the Tangun era, building fortresses and altars and residing there. Furthermore, those who took advantage of the fertile southwestern plains and moved further south became Mahan (馬韓) (distinct from the Mahan of legend, supposedly formed by the migration of Kija Chun - 箕準). As one branch ran south from the Yŏngdong region (嶺東) to form Chinhan (辰韓) and Pyŏnhan (弁韓), and another rushed south from the Yŏngsŏ region (嶺西) to form Mahan, these two branches of the same people met while circling the southern coast. This marked the beginning of our Paedal descendants spreading throughout the Korean peninsula (槿花半島) and establishing their foundation.

However, some often claim that the customs of Mahan and Chinhan were different. But having crossed over 4,000 li of high mountains and steep ranges and traversed great rivers to move south, the terrain differed, and the climate varied. How could they be expected to match? This too is an unavoidable reality. Yet, merely because the sounds of "Chin" (辰) and "Qin" (秦) are similar, those elders drunk on the dregs of centuries of Sino-centrism, calling themselves "refugees from the state of Qin" (秦國之流民), are they not fellows who delight in self-destruction and self-burial in the squalid alley of self-abasement? Why abandon one's own vast source and instead covet a narrow, shallow ditch? The argument may have strayed onto a side path, but encountering this period, historical issues, especially such ethnic fallacies, are indeed also significant points when discussing art history. This is also out of a desire to clearly investigate and establish the origins of our Paedal people. Now, let me return to the main topic.

"The people of Puyŏ are robust, strong, and brave. They use bows, arrows, swords, and spears as weapons. Every household has armor and weapons (鎧仗). They are prudent and sincere, not engaging in raids or plunder. They use ritual vessels (俎豆) for eating and drinking. Travelers sing day and night without pause; the sound of singing never ceases."

Indeed, they were heroic people, yet they also possessed a relaxed artistic disposition. Since they possessed it, it is not difficult to guess that it must have been magnificent yet elegant.

"The people are settled farmers. They build circular palisades (員柵) for fortresses. They have palaces (宮室), warehouses (倉庫), and prisons (牢獄)."

The origin of house construction, including palaces, warehouses, and prisons, lies here.

"In the country, they prefer white clothes of ramie cloth (白布) with large sleeves, robes, and trousers, and wear leather shoes (革踏). When traveling abroad, they prefer silk embroidery (繒繡), brocade (錦), and woolen fabrics (罽). High-ranking officials add furs of fox (狐), leopard cat (狸), marten (狖), and black and white sable (白黑貂)."

The relationship between Chosŏn's clothing system and art is something I intend to investigate specifically when discussing the art of the later Yi Dynasty (李朝). Indeed, ancient Chosŏn clothing <22> had aspects that were artistically unparalleled in the world. How much more so when the materials were silk embroidery, brocade, and woolen fabrics?

"When someone dies in summer, they all use ice. They bury people alive as sacrificial attendants (殉葬), sometimes numbering in the hundreds. Funerals are elaborate (厚葬), with coffins (棺) but no outer coffins (槨)."

Silla (新羅) had stone icehouses (石氷庫), but the practice of using ice was already prevalent in this period. The burial practice of having a coffin but no outer coffin also existed.

"The mourning period lasts five months; prolonging it is considered honorable. The chief mourner does not wish to rush, but others compel him. They often quarrel over this, considering it a matter of propriety. During mourning, both men and women wear pure white. Women wear cloth face coverings (布面衣) and remove rings and pendants (環珮). In the twelfth lunar month (臘月), they hold a great assembly to sacrifice to Heaven (祭天), eating, drinking, singing, and dancing for days. This is called Yŏnggo (迎鼓 - Welcoming the Drum)."

Descendants of the Paedal people, known as the "Eastern Country of Propriety" (東方禮儀之國), one can imagine their mysterious, pure, and elegant character and glimpse their optimistic disposition just by citing this aspect of their customs. In this respect, there is something similar to the culture of Greece (希臘).

"Puyŏ has 'pine wind stone' (松風石). The stone is one chang (丈) square, clear like jade (玉). Within it is a tree shape resembling an ancient pine with a spreading canopy. Rustling sounds arise, and a cool breeze emanates from it. In high summer, the king orders it placed in the palace hall. When the autumn wind blows fiercely, he orders it removed."

A place famous for producing jewels (珠玉), where large pearls (大珠) like jujubes and much red jade (赤玉) are found. Therefore, carving techniques (彫刻術) also developed.

"The treasury holds jade discs (玉璧), jade scepters (圭), and jade libation cups (瓚) from several generations, passed down as treasures. Elders say they were gifts from previous generations."

"Puyŏ kings are buried using jade caskets (玉匣). They always prepare jade caskets in advance and entrust them to Hyŏndo Commandery (玄菟郡). When the king dies, they retrieve them for the burial."

Even stone coffins (石棺) are considered rare treasures talked about incessantly by the people; how much more so a readily prepared jade casket? It says "entrusted to Hyŏndo" (付玄菟), suggesting Hyŏndo supplied jade caskets to Puyŏ.

The art of polishing, grinding, pecking, and carving (削磨啄彫) flourished early in the world, and the cause for their descendants creating masterpieces like Silla's Manbul-san (萬佛山 - Ten Thousand Buddhas Mountain) sculpture in later ages also lies here.

Subpart 2: Okchŏ (沃沮) and Yemaek (濊貊)
Similar to Puyŏ:

"The land of Okchŏ is narrow east to west, long north to south, perhaps foldable into a square of 1,000 li. The soil is fertile and beautiful, mountains at the back, facing the sea. Suitable for the five grains, good at farming. The people are upright, strong, and brave."

The terrain and disposition are not particularly different from Puyŏ, but being adjacent to the sea in the east, they were also skilled at boating and fishing.<23>

"The country has unmarked coins (國錢無文). The marriage custom involves the bride's family demanding money (錢); only after the money is paid does she return to the groom."

Along with Chinhan's iron currency (鐵錢), this might be the beginning of Chosŏn's minting techniques (鑄錢術). The Wuzhu coins (五銖錢) of the Four Commanderies period likely have their origin here. One can imagine the level of the people who, having passed through the era of barter and using shells and cloth as currency, were already commonly using unmarked coins.

"For burials, they use large wooden outer coffins (大木槨) over ten chang long, with an opening at one end as a door. The newly deceased are first temporarily buried (假埋) to let the flesh decay completely, then the bones are collected and placed in the outer coffin. All family members share one coffin (*unclear character, likely 槨). Wooden figures resembling the deceased are carved according to the number of dead. There is also an earthenware pot (瓦력 - perhaps 瓦罌?) containing rice, woven and hung near the coffin door."

One can imagine the concepts of life and death held by the people of that time. What is particularly noteworthy here is waiting for the flesh to decay before burial and hanging an earthenware pot near the coffin door, etc., having similarities to the Egyptian (埃及) people who made mummies (木乃伊). It must have been done with their utmost sincerity and craftsmanship. Though we cannot see the actual objects now, the immense effort spared in constructing tombs throughout the Three Kingdoms and Koryŏ periods originates from here.

"The Yemaek people are honest and sincere, with few desires, possessing a sense of shame. Their custom does not value pearls and jade as treasures. They always sacrifice to Heaven in the tenth month, drinking, singing, and dancing day and night, called Much'on (儛天 - Heaven Dance). Their music making is generally the same as Puyŏ's, only the month used differs."

A disposition of integrity and diligence is our unique privilege due to the peninsula's geography. How could the Yemaek be different? Merely stating they did not treasure pearls and jade is slightly different from Puyŏ, but in expressing a bold spirit, they were in no way inferior.

"The Yemaek are good at observing the stars, predicting the year's abundance or scarcity in advance."

Whether there were astronomical observatories (天文臺) etc. is untestable, but their culture, which led to the construction of Silla's Ch'ŏmsŏngdae (瞻星臺 - Star-Gazing Tower), was like this. Even this small detail allows us to examine the entire quality of their culture. Indeed, they were a people possessing extraordinary innate talents who expressed their grand spirit in a divinely established spiritual land.

Subpart 3: Chinhan (辰韓), Appendix: Pyŏnhan (弁韓)
We, who have refuted the erroneous legends of the elders, hereby confirm the Chinhan people as belonging to the vast Paedal lineage and admire them endlessly.<24>

"The land of Chinhan is fertile and beautiful, suitable for planting the five grains and rice. They understand sericulture (蠶桑) and make silk fabric (縑布). They ride oxen and horses."

The source of the famous Silla weaving (新羅織組) already existed inherently at this time.

"They have walled enclosures (城柵) and dwellings (屋室). Houses are made by horizontally layering logs (橫累木), resembling prisons (牢獄)."

The log construction method for houses, still occasionally found in northern mountain valleys today, exists, allowing us to trace its developmental path.

"The country produces iron (鐵). All markets use it as currency (錢), like China uses coins. Han (韓), Yemaek (濊), and Wa (倭 - Japan) all obtain it from them. It is also supplied to the two commanderies (二郡)."

The origin of minting in the Silla kingdom, renowned as the creator of currency in the entire world, was thus. Setting aside the four neighbors, it was even supplied across the sea to Wa.

"The Chinhan people all bind their hair. Men and women near Wa have tattoos (文身). Travelers yield the road."

The customs of the people who later caused the Wa people, intending to invade the borders with troops, to ultimately fear their divine virtue and commit the disgrace of retreating, were also like this.

"They enjoy singing and dancing, drinking wine, and playing the sŏl (瑟 - zither). They send off the dead with large bird feathers (大鳥羽), intending for the deceased to soar (飛揚)."

Their religious thought has similarities to Okchŏ, dreaming of the deceased soaring, etc. Indeed, the existence of fresh and elegant sentiments can be glimpsed. Pyŏnhan (弁韓) is similar to Chinhan, but:

"The country has the sŏl (瑟). Its shape resembles the zhù (筑 - another ancient zither). When plucked, it makes sound. The melodies are similar to Huqin (胡琴 - barbarian fiddle) music."

The origin of the Kayagŭm (伽倻琴) existed inherently in the Pyŏnhan period. Viewing it from this perspective, one can amply imagine the character and sentiment of the people as well. Truly, they were endowed with an optimistic disposition.

Subpart 4: Mahan (馬韓)
Among people, some transmit the story that Mahan was founded by Kija Chun (箕準), a descendant of Kija (箕子). However, although the southern Chosŏn region at that time consisted of small states established in beautiful, clear valleys, it could also be called an era of contending warlords (羣雄割據). How could the weak Kija Chun, who couldn't even repel a minor foreign invader like Wiman (衛滿)<25> and was forced into the shame of fleeing south, have become the king of Mahan?

This too suggests he likely made himself a self-proclaimed emperor in some small, secluded valley. What is discussed here specifically concerns the culture of Mahan, founded by descendants of the Paedal people.

"The Mahan people are settled farmers. They are scattered between mountains and sea, without walled cities (城郭). They build thatched houses (草屋) and dugout huts (土室) shaped like homes. The door is on top. The whole family lives together inside."

Examining this, one might say their living standard was still undeniably primitive, yet one can imagine how natural it was.

"When the authorities order the building of walled cities, all the brave and strong young men pierce the skin on their backs and thread large ropes through it. They also insert logs about a chang long. They cheer loudly all day, working hard without feeling pain. This serves both to encourage work and demonstrate strength. Although there are fights and battles, they value mutual submission."

The people's character was upright, strong, and brave, like this.

"They do not value gold, treasures, brocade, or woolens (金寶錦罽). They only prize beads (瓔珠), stringing them onto clothes as decoration, and hanging them from the head and ears. Most go bareheaded with topknots exposed (魁頭露紒), wearing hemp robes (布袍) and straw sandals (草履)."

The fact that their flawless, pure ornaments were already in widespread use is equally worthy of admiration.

"Always in the fifth month, after planting is finished, they sacrifice to ghosts and spirits (鬼神). Day and night, they gather for drinking parties, singing and dancing. When dancing, several dozen people rise together, follow each other, stomp the ground, raise and lower hands and feet in rhythm, resembling the sound of bells (鐸聲). In the tenth month, when farm work is finished, they do the same."

"They believe in ghosts and spirits. Each state and town appoints one person to preside over sacrifices to the sky god (天神), calling him Ch'ŏn'gun (天君 - Heavenly Prince). Also, each state has a separate district called Sodo (蘇塗). They erect large poles, hang bells (鈴) and drums (鼓), and serve the spirits."

"They do not know how to ride oxen or horses. Livestock are only used for funeral processions (送葬). For burials, they have coffins (棺) but no outer coffins (棹 - likely 槨)."

Concepts regarding religion are also largely similar throughout the Three Han, but the Mahan people, in particular, are a good representative example, possessing both the simple character of the north and the joyful sentiment of the south. The burial practice of having a coffin but no outer coffin is also similar to Puyŏ.

Part 2: Overview (槪說)
To speak of sculpture (彫塑) might seem too bold, but since there were jade caskets (玉匣) prepared for the burial of kings, how could there not be ordinary examples? As we cannot see the objects today, it is difficult to praise them hastily. However, even inferring from the stone coffins (石槨) of the later Koryŏ period, the creation of carvings like the Blue Dragon (靑龍), White Tiger (白虎),<26> and arabesque patterns (唐草模樣) is truly admirable in many cases. How much more so for the jade casket intended to enshrine the remains of a Puyŏ king who wielded power over the world in that era? Its utmost skill and subtlety can be imagined.

From the wooden outer coffins (木槨) of East Okchŏ, we get an example of those commonly used by ordinary people. The skeletal remains of one family were sequentially placed into a single large wooden coffin reaching over 10 chang in length. One can gauge how cherished and valuable that wooden coffin, created with their sincerity and effort, must have been, and what kind of design (意匠) might have been applied. Moreover, the mention of "carved wood" (刻木) seems to confirm this fact strongly.

Jade discs (玉璧) and jade scepters/libation cups (圭瓚) were stored in the Puyŏ treasury, treasured and passed down through generations by the people. Inferring from Han Dynasty jade discs, the exquisite art of carving must have arisen early.

The Mahan people, who did not value gold, treasures, brocade, or woolens, still adorned their bodies by attaching jade beads (珠玉) to clothing and hanging them from their heads. This is evidence that our Paedal people possessed an artistic wellspring (慧源) even in the primitive era.

Regarding casting (鑄造), Chinhan supplied currency (貨幣) to its four neighbors and even across the sea to Wa, and East Okchŏ had a custom of valuing money (貴錢) in marriage. It is certain that minting, albeit of unmarked coins, was practiced. Furthermore, Yemaek men wore silver flowers (銀花) several inches wide as ornaments, and Puyŏ women removed their rings and pendants (環珮) during mourning. What kind of rings and pendants these were might not be impossible to imagine by associating them with artifacts from the later Lelang (樂浪) period. Also, it is said that high-ranking Puyŏ officials decorated their hats (飾帽) with gold and silver (金銀), indicating that casting methods for precious metals like gold and silver, besides iron (鐵), already existed.

The Puyŏ people used ritual vessels (俎豆) for eating and drinking, showing the development of woodworking (梓工). East Okchŏ had a custom of storing polished rice in earthenware pots (瓦䥶) and hanging them woven near the coffin door. Even today, farmers in the southern three provinces (三南地方) commonly use these pots (瓦䥶), whose shape resembles Japanese tripods (倭鼎). Pottery jars (陶器의 壺) excavated near Kangnŭng (江陵) in Kangwŏn province, the ancient land of Yemaek, possess a質實 (substance/quality) and 色彩 (color) so profound and lofty that they could serve as models for later works. The fact that pottery techniques (陶業術) were already mature in that era can only elicit endless astonishment.

Regarding Puyŏ's palaces (宮室), warehouses (倉庫), and prisons (牢獄), even their shadows are vague, so their construction (構成) and decoration (刻飾) cannot be discussed. However, looking at the form and quality of flat tiles (平瓦) discovered in the old land of Okchŏ, and the patterns (紋樣) on their surfaces, tile manufacturing (製瓦業) aside, one can infer the state of architectural techniques (建築術) of that era which used them.

In weaving (織造), there was Chinhan's silk fabric (縑布), woven by combining several silk threads (絹絲), already famous at the time. That Puyŏ people favored silk embroidery (繒繡), brocade (錦), and woolen fabrics (罽) when traveling abroad is another apt example.

Therefore, even in ancient times, deemed impossible to investigate through literature, such abundant and splendid artistic wellsprings (藝術的 慧源) were revealed through sculpture, casting, architecture, etc.<27>

**Summary**

Pak Chonghong argues that while traditional East Asian, particularly Korean, views subordinated art (美術) to morality and utility, making it a mere "secondary pursuit" (餘技) for scholar-gentlemen unlike the independent aesthetic value accorded in Europe, archaeological evidence from prehistoric shell mounds and historical records of the Paedal people (Puyŏ, Okchŏ, Yemaek, Chinhan, Pyŏnhan, Mahan) reveal a rich, innate artistic sensibility. He points to sophisticated crafts like jade carving (玉匣), large wooden coffins (木槨), metalworking (casting coins, gold/silver ornaments), pottery, architecture (palaces, fortresses, log houses), and weaving (silk, brocade) as proof of an early developed aesthetic consciousness and technical skill, forming the foundation (嚆矢, 慧源) for later Korean artistic achievements, even if lacking extant masterpieces or detailed records from the earliest periods.

From a colonial history perspective, the article is interesting for its strong emphasis on a distinct and ancient Korean (Paedal) ethnic and cultural identity originating in Manchuria (Puyŏ), separate from and predating significant Chinese influence (refuting the Kija origin for Mahan and the Qin refugee origin for Chinhan). Writing in 1922 under Japanese rule, Pak's focus on the deep roots, unique qualities (e.g., Paedal "heroic spirit," artistic disposition), and early sophistication of Korean culture, even comparing aspects favorably to Greece, can be seen as an assertion of national pride and historical continuity counteracting colonial narratives. His critique of traditional Confucian views on art also reflects modernizing intellectual trends of the time.

朝鮮美術의 史的 考察

第2章 上古時代
第1節 古代美術의 穿考
自古로 東洋에서는 禮·樂·射·御·書·數를 6藝라 稱하야 甚至於 狩獵·耕作·醫術·卜筮之類까지도 所謂 藝術이라는 者에 編入할새 即 英語의 Art를 가장 廣義로 解釋한 者와 相類하니 特히 그 以上 美術이라는 (廣義로 解釋치 아니한 Art 即 Fine art) 觀念을 不有한 鴻濛無據의 其藝나마
志於道, 據於德, 依於仁, 遊於藝,
遊於藝라하야 道에 志하는 者라도 此藝를 可히 不顧치 아니치 못할 者-로되 오히려 此에는 特別되게 遊한다 하얏스니
『藝也者, 雖志道之士, 所不能忘, 然, 特遊之而已, 畫亦藝也』云云 (宋宣和畫譜)
畢竟은 美術이 士君子의 餘技에 不過함을 論述함이 明明하도다. 或 此에 反駁을 容코저하는 頑固類의 漢學者輩가 有하야 6藝에 通함으로써서 道와 德에 達하는 者라고 論難하며 反對함이 不無할지나 此는 決코 前說의 非難은 되지 아니할지니 以是로 美術의 價値가 高하야지거나 貴하야점은 업슬지라 (勿論 그들이 特히 美術의 價値를 推想함으로써 如然한 者는 아닐지라.)＜15＞
即 그의 目的이 道德에 在한 以上, 倫理를 造成하는 一方便이 됨에 不過한 美術이 될지라. 申此觀之 할지라도 修身, 齊家, 治國, 平天下의 本이라는 道德을 無上의 至寶로 重要視하고 美術과 如함은 그들의 目的을 達하는 一手段에 不外한 者-라하야 오즉 倫理를 委한 奴隷的 美術을 作함에 至하고 말앗슴을 自證하도다.
是故로 修身, 德成以後에 비롯오 此를 翫好 할지니
德成而, 一藝隨之, 非損本務末也,
自初로 遊藝를 專業爲事 할진대 是亦 其本을 損하고 末을 務하는 者-라하야 不取하니 名匠이라도 그의 人品이 道德(特히 形式的)과 相違한다하면 重히 녀기는 바- 되지 못하며 凡工이라도 그 人格이 出衆하다하면 그 技를 藝苑에 傳後하는 事가 有하도다.
古人圖畫, 無非勸戒. (畫史)
夫畫者, 成敎化, 助人倫, 窮神變, 測幽微. (名畫記)
一部의 端的인 繪畫에 對한 理想이나 此를 推移하야 또한 可히 一般美術에 對한 觀念이라 할지니 美術의 職能이 勸善懲惡으로 爲主하고 審美的 鑑賞과 如한 者는 오히려 餘事에 속한 事이엇슴을 알지로다.
故로 美術의 所要가 功利上의 目的으로 歸하니 道德을 爲한 美術이 아니면 오즉 過去의 史蹟 即 歷史를 爲한 美術이 어떠랴.
是以로 환쟁이(畫家), 彫刻쟁이(彫刻家), 木手쟁이(건축사), 대장쟁이(冶金家) 等 쟁이의 名號를 附用하는 一般民間은 不付贅辯이어니와 聰明하다는 所謂 士君子 中에도 往往 此를 賤視함이 古來의 常例이엇스니 = (特히 李朝에 至하야) = 彼 歐洲의 美術이 宗敎와 歷史 等, 所謂 高尙하다는 覇絆에까지 退脫하야 漸次 純然自由한 審美的 製作에 接近케 되고 尙且 近世 美學者의 硏鑽의 功으로 因하야 獨立한 品位와 價値를 特認하게 된 者와는 그 趣向이 判異한지라.
然則 名手巨匠의 大天才가 在하야 是苑에 遊하는 者- 或은 眞實로 純然한 審美的 情趣로써 藝術의 鑑賞을 是好하는 者가 有하야 設使 本來부터 此界의 尋常한 拘束을 超越하야 그 中에 自家特成의 別天地를 獨有하얏섯다＜16＞ 할지라도 그 美術家의 品格上 世人 一般의 待遇로 論之하면 彼歐洲에 對하야 到底히 比할 者- 아닐지로다.
又况 所謂 美術家로서 道德(形式的)의 奴隷가 됨은 姑捨하고 衣食을 爲한 作品을 造成함으로써 是爲 理想이라하며 滿足타하야 自處하기 甚히 卑屈한 者- 有함이랴. 돌이어 美術의 侮辱을 作할 뿐이라.
此가 비록 近代人의 美術에 對한 觀念이나 此로써 推想할지라도 美術品의 保存과 如함은 夢中에도 想起치 못하얏슬지로다.
그 中에서 傳襲하야 生長한 우리의 美術, 더구나 此에 論코저 하는 生活狀態까지도 尙未免野인 古代의 美術, 間或 發見된다는 熹微한 遺物의 穿鑿은 차라리 考古學의 範圍에 續할지오.
그 時代와의 關係와 互相間의 連絡 變天이 明確치 못한 以上, 美術史를 論하는 者의 可히 探究할 바- 아니라. 故로 遺寶를 採集 排列하야 此를 比擬槪括하며 史料를 探索考覈하야 此를 按排 組織할 새 三國時代로부터 論起함이 穩當하다는 嫌疑가 尙存한지나 然이나 이미 史라 云하는지라 即 發達의 記錄이니 時代와 伴하야 變遷 推移한 史蹟에 憑據하야 그의 變遷의 理由推移의 因緣에 就하야 多少間 說明이 亦是 不無할지라.
彼歐洲 「歷史의 始祖」 Father of History로 指稱하는 希臘의 史家헤「헤로도터스」 Herodotus 의 記錄한 바 歷史는 果然 如何한가. 神話의 類集도 아니오. 考古學의 硏究書도 아니라 오즉 當世의 歷史를 論述하얏섯나니 그 神話를 展列하며 考古學의 事實 等을 云謂코저함이 그이의 目的은 아니라. 此를 論하얏슴은 다못 그 時代와의 關係上, 그의 源由를 溯及코저 할진대 不可不入의 窮境이라. 그리 咎치 아니함이 可할지니 돌이어 그 心勞의 º¦를 可測할 資인뎌. 即 幼하고 穉하다 하야 後代 美術의 祖宗이 되는 此 古代의 作品을 豈可以等閑視할 者-리오.
記錄이 無한 有史以前 第4世紀頃 그 中에도 더욱 舊石器時代인 洪積期부터 이미 人類는 美를 求함에 孜孜不息하얏나니 佛蘭西南部 「돌더뉴」河 支流沿岸에서 發見된 洞穴의 遺物中에는 骨製의 釣針이 有하며 動物의 骨面에 趣味잇는 彫刻을 施한 者가 多하거니와 그 동굴의 壁에 馴鹿羣의 模樣을 刻함과 如함은 그의 一適例라.
또 現今의 野蠻人 中에는 裸軆로 生活하면서도 尙且角이나 或은 貝殼 等으로써 그 身體를 飾하며 矮小한 茅屋에도 幾分間 裝飾을 施함에 徵할진대 비록 外見이 甚히 粗野하야 不可論의 愚味한 古代의 未開人이라도 그 美를 求하는＜17＞ 念이 勃勃하얏슴은 可히 窺得할 바-로다.
비록 創作과 그의 鑑賞은 時代를 超越한다 云하나 그의써 發하는 바와 由하는 바는 또한 因果의 法則에 支配되는 此界에 求치 아니치 못할지라. 然則 그의 發端을 久遠한 곳에 求한다고 한들 何者가 그리 怪異할 바-리오.
因하야 玆에 上古時代라 命名하고 是에 起頭하야 그들의 片鱗을 收拾配列함에 至한 所以-라.
然而 佛敎가 朝鮮에 傳來하기는 高句麗 小獸林王 2年의 事인즉 此에 上代는 勿論 佛敎的 美術의 影響까지도 波及치 아니하야 그의 美術品이 一面은 時代가 時代매 極히 古劣함은 不免이나 또한 一面은 倍達族의 雄豪하며 幽邃한 天賦之性을 純粹하게 意量대로 마음껏 發揮한 時代라 云할지라. 또한 貴하며 重치 아니하리오. 더욱 此 險求苦按의 發露에 依하야 비록 古拙하야 可稱할만한 者는 업스나 現代의 吾人으로서도 尙且 可及키 難할만치 單雅, 高尙한 美術品이 數千載 古代에 旣成되엇섯슴을 可히 發見하겟슴이로다.

第2節 上代
古代美術을 考究함에 緊切한 對象物이 되며 憑據品이 될 즉 當時의 遺物과 故蹟의 缺乏함이 斯學을 探覈함에 非凡한 難關이 됨은 前章에서 이미 論述한 바-라.
幾千의 星霜이 轉換하며 幾百의 世代가 輪替할스록 또한 그의 熹微함과 漠然함의 層度를 累加한 것도 不論而可想이어늘 又况 錯誤를 未信이라는 文字의 記錄이나마 그것조차 難得인 神話의 別世界 가튼 감이 不無한 太古이리오. 眞實로 苦辨難證의 節目이 延增함을 不免할지며 不知케라. 다못 玆에 是로부터 爲縮함이 反히 予의 愚荒함을 表露함이 아닌가 하노라.

第1 有史前
朝鮮民族史의 序幕은 檀君時代로부터 비롯오 開始하고 그 以上 一步도 越線함은 不許하도다. 又况 對象物까지 要求하는 美術史임에리오. 然而 果然 其外에 少許라도 더욱 探考할만한 餘地가 無한 者인가. 如何. 即 何者에＜18＞ 恃依하며 某物을 捉來하야 此를 補하며 그에 대코저 함인가.
此에는 不可不 考古學의 圈圍를 暫時라도 犯치 아니치 못할지라. 當代의 遺物로서 石器, 骨器, 土器 等이 稀貴하나마 到處에 散在한 白山黑水廣濶한 우리의 古墟는 當世의 一大遺跡이라 할지로다. 此의 確實한 遺跡을 發見하며 遺物을 採集하야써 探究한 結果는 文化史와 民族史의 價値에 不遜하는 者-라, 遺跡에도 遺物의 包含地와 散在地가 有하나 系統的으로 考究함에는 그의 包含地 더욱 貝塚이 最適者-라.
貝塚이라 함은 第4紀, 冲積期 時代 即 石器時代에 居住하던 種族(現今 亞米利加의 一部에는 尙且貝塚을 積成하는 土人이 有하나) 이 食用에 供하는 貝類의 殼과 그를 利用하야 造成한 器具 等의 堆積場을 指稱함이니 朝鮮內에서도 石器와 土器를 또한 無數히 發見할새 그 形狀은 各各 地方을 隨하야 多少 相異가 不無하나 그 種類인즉 皆是 同一한 者-러라.
貝塚의 硏究는 極히 近年에 屬한 者-니 歐洲에서는 丁抹이 其中 精密한 硏究를 行한 者-요 瑞西, 佛蘭西, 英吉利 等이 次에 位하도다. 丁抹 附近의 東海岸에는 高가 3尺 乃至 1丈餘요 長이 百6,70間, 廣이 30間 以上에 及할 貝塚이 宛然한 堤防을 成하야 잇다. 우리 朝鮮의 貝塚도 그와 相似하야 其中 重要한 者는 大槪 東海邊에 在할새 더욱 北鮮地方에 多하니 咸鏡北道 富寧郡內의 蛛堣貝塚과 咸鏡南道 利原郡 附近에 發見된 者 等이 그의 一例라. 露領 沿海洲 海岸 附近과 豆滿江, 烏蘇里江 沿邊(東沃沮의 古地)의 貝塚에서는 石斧, 石鏃, 石弩 等 石器와 土器外에 骨錐, 骨針, 角刀 等의 角骨器 及 金器類를 發掘하얏스며 彼處의 露人도 此等 貝塚을 焚燒하야 白灰를 製할時에 亦是 其中에 無數한 石器를 拾得하얏도다. 南鮮地方의 貝塚으로 이미 發見되어 幾許間 硏究된 者는 慶尙南道 金海邑 鳳凰臺 下에 在한 貝塚이니 北方의 貝塚과 殊異한 点은 別無하나 石器時代의 發達을 考察함에 充足할만한 遺物의 包含層을 留存함으로 朝鮮의 最重 最貴한 史料의 一이 됨으로써 世人의 耳目을 誘引하는 者-라. 該 貝塚은 高가 1丈 5尺 加良이오. 長이 60間, 幅이 20間에 至하니 大槪 4層으로 分함을 得할지라. 上部에는 新羅式의 土器類를 出하고 粘土層을 過하야 漸下하면 角骨器, 鐵器 及 石器를 多數 發見하니 角骨器 中에는 鹿角을 切理하야 造作한 小刀의 柄이 多數히 遺存할 새 瑞西國 「마이렌」湖 中에서 發見한 新石器時代의 遺物과 恰似하도다. 그 外에＜19＞ 骨鏃 等도 有하며 더욱 鐵刀의 腐蝕한 者 等이 殘在하니 當時에 鐵의 使用되엿슴을 可知며 此에 憑依하야 角骨鐵의 幷用되엇슴을 推測할지요. 오즉 年代가 久遠하야 그의 形軆가 不完함이 可惜할 바인뎌. 또 그 下層에는 古石器時代의 石器 等 遺物을 包有하도다.
以上은 貝塚의 槪見이니 美術商 價値는 何如튼 그等 土器와 金器類로써 當代에 製陶業, 冶金術 等이 旣行하엿슴을 可商할 者이매 此에 依하야 當代의 人民이 幼稚하고 微弱하나마 審美的 意向을 表現한 者라 觀察함이 可할지로다.

第2 有史 後
檀君時代는 堂堂한 倍達國의 隆盛하얏든 時期라. 古朝鮮紀에 曰
降于太白山檀木下. 開拓山河, 生育人物. 至再週甲子之戊辰上月三日. 御靈宮誕訓神誥時, 彭吳率三千團部衆, 頫首受之. 高矢採靑石於東海濱. 神誌畫其石以傳之
高矢禮는 荒蕪를 開拓하야 5穀의 農作을 興케하얏슴으로 後人의 相傳하는 바-요. 寶石과 珠玉의 産이 豊富하던 倍達國의 일이라. 東海濱에서 玉石을 採得하얏다함도 無怪한 事-며 神誌는 文字를 制하고 彝倫을 定하야 人民을 敎育하얏슴으로 東方에 彝倫이 始明하얏다 云하니 文字가 旣有한 當時라. 筆墨으로 畫함은 後世에 至하야 發明한 者인즉 如何한 書畫이엇든지는 可測키 難하나 刀錐로써 角石에 彫畫함으로 書畫가 始行된 者-라 하는 以上 何如컨 그 玉石의 面에 刻畫하야 傳後하얏다함도 無疑한 事實인 듯 하도다. 即 此로서 우리 美術史上 彫刻 繪畫의 嚆矢로 認定하나 幾乎誤想이 아닐 줄로 斟酌하노라. 然이나 此는 다만 記錄에 의할 뿐이오 實地로 對象物에 接치 못하니 歎惜을 不已하는 바-로다.
그러타고 檀君時代의 故蹟이 全無함은 아니니
設祭天壇. 第三郞城. 後徙都唐莊京.

此祭大하든 壇은 江華島 곳 距邑 南 4里許의 東으로는 北漢山을 遙望할지며 西으로는 星羅碁布한 諸島를 一眸之下에 收置할 雄豪의 佳景이 言筆同絶之處인 摩尼山 上에 在한 塹城壇(一名, 瞻星壇)이 是也며 遣三子而築城 故로＜20＞ 名을 三郞이라 稱하는 三郞城도 亦是 距邑南 約里 3許의 傳燈山에 在하니 幾劫의 暴風慘雨를 閱盡하얏스리오마는 尙且 完然한 遺跡을 存留함이야 實로 三國時代의 雄豪한 氣韻을 表現한 造壇, 築城의 優越한 建築術이 當時로부터 始初되엇슴을 推想함에 足하도다. 또한 此가 우리 倍達族의 氣像과 抱負를 示現한 者가 아니고 무엇이리오.

第4節 三韓期
第1 三韓時代의 文化
玆에 三韓時代라 稱함은 우리 倍達國 檀君의 後裔인 種族이 北은 遼東으로부터 黑水間에 橫臥한 滿洲의 大原으로부터 南은 海洋을 隔한 諸島에까지 蔓延 頒布된 當時를 云함이니 구태어 南部一端에 不過할 三韓 뿐만을 論함은 아니로다. 然而 美術史라는 論說下에 文化를 云云함은 넘우도 廣濫한 嫌이 不無타 할지나 數千載의 歷史를 가진 今日로서도 오히려 確固 獨立한 藝術的 作品은 數算하기에 稀少한 者-어든 又况 名字까지 이미 上古라는 時代임이리오. 獨特한 美術의 索考는 勿論 不可量의 事이어니와 이미 史를 論코저하는 吾人은 그의 佳芽良苗가 潛伏하여잇는 當代의 文化를 어찌 可히 써 探究치 아니하고 말것이랴.

其1 扶餘
倍達族의 根據地라 할 廣敞한 滿洲平野에 雄視하던 扶餘의 文化는 果然 如何하얏든가.
扶餘, 其北有弱水, 地方二千里, 最爲平敞, 土宜五穀, 本濊地也.
國多山陵廣澤, 國有故城, 名濊城, 蓋本濊貊之地也.
濊貊의 種族이 此에 築城하고 住居하다가 是로부터 東南에 蔓延되엇슴을 證左함이며 더욱
濊貊其俗, 忌諱疾病, 死亡輒損棄舊宅, 更造新居.
此에 憑據하면 그 濊貊人이 移住를 是好하는 性이 有하얏섯슴을 知할지니 即 脊梁山脈의 東部 細長한 平野를 從하야＜21＞ 南下하얀 沃沮를 建하얏슴이 自明할지니 江原道 南部의 最狹한 處가 後世에 至하야 人跡이 殆無함으로 오즉 南北의 民人을 區別케 되엇슬 뿐이로다.
此와 對하야 西便으로는 檀君時代에 이미 江華에까지 南遷하야 築城造壇而住居한지라. 또한 西南의 沃野를 乘하야 더욱 南遷한 者- 即 馬韓(所謂 箕準의 移住함으로 되엇다는 傳說에 有한 馬韓과는 判異)이 되니 嶺東에서 南走하야 辰韓, 弁韓을 成하고 嶺西에서 南奔하야 馬韓을 成할 새 此 2支의 同族이 南海沿岸을 周廻하다가 相逢하니 此에 비롯오 槿花半島에 우리 倍達子孫이 遍昌하야 그 地盤을 確立하게된 始初로다.
然而 馬韓과 辰韓의 風習不同함을 云謂하는 者- 往往 有지나 이미 4,000餘里의 高山峻嶺을 遷越하며 巨河 大江을 渡涉하야 南下한지라. 地勢가 相異하고 風土가 互殊하얏스니 豈可以 相符키를 期할 바-리오. 此亦 莫可奈何의 事理어늘 오즉 辰과 秦의 字音이 相類라하야 幾百代 支那崇拜의 末廢에 醉罹되어 所謂 秦國之流民이라 自稱하는 耆老徒야말로 自爆自虐의 陋巷에 自沒自埋됨을 是喜是悅하는 輩流가 아니랴. 何故로 淊滔한 自家의 源流를 捨하고 오히려 狹隘한 淺溝를 貪함이리오. 所論이 傍路로 迂廻한 嫌도 是有할지나 此期를 適會하매 歷史上의 問題 더욱 如斯한 民族間의 誤謬와 如함은 實로 美術史를 論究함에 또한 重大한 節目이라. 또한 우리 倍達族의 源跡을 明確히 探立하고저함으로써요. 玆에 本論으로 還코저 하노라.
扶餘其人麤大彊勇, 以弓矢刀矛爲兵, 家家有鎧仗而謹厚, 不爲寇鈔, 食飮用俎豆, 行人無晝夜好歌吟, 音聲不絶.
實로 豪健한 民人이고서도 오히려 閒漫한 藝術的 氣風을 幷存하얏스며 幷存한 以上 雄壯하고도 雅麗한 者이엇슬 것도 可測키 不難하도다.
其民土著, 以員柵爲城, 有宮室倉庫牢獄.
宮室과 倉庫 牢獄 等의 家屋建築의 源頭가 在此하얏스며
在國, 尙衣白布大袂袍袴, 履革踏, 出國則, 尙繒繡錦罽, 大人加狐狸狖, 白黑貂之裘.
朝鮮의 衣服制와 美術과의 關係는 後 李朝時代美術을 論할 時에 特히 考究코저하는 바이어니와 朝鮮의 古代衣服은＜22＞ 果然 美術的으로 된 點이 世界에 無類한 者라. 又况 그의 才料가 繒繡며 錦罽임이리오.
其死夏月, 皆用氷, 殺人殉葬, 多者以百數, 厚葬有棺無槨
新羅에 石氷庫가 有하거니와 用氷의 法은 이미 此期에 盛行되엇스며 有棺無槨의 葬法이 旣有하얏도다.
停喪五月以久爲榮, 主不欲速而他人强之, 常諍引以此爲節, 其居喪男女皆衣純白, 婦人著布面衣去環珮. 以臘月祭天大會, 連日飮食歌舞, 名曰迎鼓.
東方禮儀之國의 稱이 有한 倍達族의 後裔라, 그 習俗의 一端을 擧하야 神秘純雅한 그들의 品性을 可想할지요. 樂天的 情操를 窺得할지니 此點에 在하야 彼希臘의 文化와 類한 者- 有하도다.
扶餘有松風石, 石方一丈塋徹如玉, 其中有樹形, 若古松偃蓋, 颯颯焉而凉飆生於其間, 至盛夏, 上令置于殿內, 秋風飇飇卽令撤去.
大珠如酸棗하여 多出赤玉이라하는 珠玉의 名産地라. 是以로 彫刻術 等도 發達하얏섯도다.
庫有玉璧圭瓚數代之物, 傳世以爲寶, 耆老言先世之所賜也.
扶餘王葬用玉匣, 常豫以玉匣, 付玄菟郡, 王死則迎取以葬.
石棺도 尙且 稀貴한 至寶라 하야 民人의 膾炙하기 마지아니하는 바-어든 玉匣을 常豫함이리오. 付玄菟라 하얏스니 即 玄菟가 扶餘에 玉匣을 供給한 者 갓도다.
일즉 削磨啄彫의 術이 盛行於世하야 그 後裔로 하야곰 後世에 新羅 萬佛山과 如한 傑作의 彫成을 做出케한 因緣이 또한 此에 在하얏도다.

其2 沃沮와 濊貊
扶餘와 相類한 者-니
沃沮其地東西夾, 南北長, 可折方千里, 土肥美, 背山向海, 宜五穀, 善田種, 人性質直彊勇.
地勢와 人性이 扶餘와 相異함은 別無하나 東에 海를 濱함으로 乘船捕漁에도 長하얏스며＜23＞
國錢無文, 其國嫁娶之法, 女家責錢, 錢畢, 乃復還壻.
辰韓의 鐵錢과 共히 朝鮮의 鑄錢術이 施行된 始初일지니 4郡時代의 五銖錢도 그의 源頭는 此에 在할지며 物物交換으로부터 貝殼類와 布帛 等을 貨幣로 使用하던 時代를 經하야 이미 無文錢이나마 常用한 民人의 程度를 可想할지로다.
其葬, 大木槨長十餘丈, 開一頭爲戶, 新死者先假埋之, 令皮肉盡, 乃取骨置槨中, 家人皆共一*, 刻木如主, 隨死者爲數焉, 又有瓦력置米其中, 編懸之於槨戶邊.
當代 民人의 死生觀에 對한 觀念을 可히 推想할지며 더욱 此에 注意할 것은 皮肉의 盡함을 待하야 葬하며 槨戶邊에 瓦력을 編懸하는 等 木乃伊를 作하던 埃及 民族과 近似한 點을 有하는 者-니 그들의 誠意와 匠妙를 盡한 者이엇슬 것임이로다. 今에 그 實物에는 對치 못하나 三國時代와 高麗時代를 通하야 墳墓를 作成함에 無上한 勞力을 不惜함이 此에서 發源함인뎌.
濊其人性愿慤, 少嗜欲, 有廉恥. 其俗不以珠玉爲寶, 常用十月祭天, 晝夜飮酒歌舞, 名爲儛天, 其作樂大抵與扶餘同, 特所用月異耳.
淸廉하고도 勤厚한 性情은 半島의 地勢上 吾人의 獨擅한 特權이라. 濊貊이라고 어찌 殊異하리오. 다만 珠玉으로 不以爲寶라 함은 扶餘와 大同小異한바-나 雄活한 氣像을 發揮함에는 少毫도 그에게 遜色이 無하도다.
濊善曉候星宿, 豫知年歲豊約.
天文臺 等의 有無는 不可考也나 新羅의 瞻星臺를 築造케 한 그들의 文化가 如斯하얏도다. 此의 一毫로써도 可히 그 文化의 全質을 可考也요. 果然 非常한 天賦之性을 具有한 種族이 天設의 靈區에서 그의 雄大한 氣像을 表現한 者-로다.

其3 辰韓 付 弁韓
耆老輩의 誤傳을 反駁한 吾人은 辰韓人으로써 滔滔漫漫한 倍達族임을 茲에 確認하고 더욱 그들을 欽慕하기 不已＜24＞하는바-라.
辰韓土地肥美, 宜種五穀及稻, 曉蠶桑作縑布, 乘駕牛馬.
此 時에 이미 有名한 新羅織組의 芽源이 固有하얏스며
有城柵屋室, 作室橫累木爲之, 有似牢獄也.
于今토록 北方山谷에 往往 探偶하는 橫累木式의 家屋建築法이 尙有하니 그 發達의 歷路를 可考할 者-요.
國出鐵, 諸市賈皆用錢, 如中國用錢, 韓濊倭皆從取之, 又以供給二郡.
世界全貨의 創製國으로 擅名하는 新羅國의 鑄錢한 源兆가 如此하얏나니 4隣은 姑捨하고 隔海한 倭에까지 供給하얏슴이로다.
辰韓人皆編頭, 男女近倭有文身, 行者讓路.
後에 倭人으로 하야금 行兵하야 邊防을 侵犯코저 하다가 畢竟 그 神德의 威風을 畏敬하야 退還의 醜를 作케한 民人의 習俗이 또한 如斯하얏스며
喜歌舞, 飮酒鼓瑟, 以大鳥羽送死, 其意欲死者飛揚
그들의 宗敎的 思想이 沃沮와 近似한 者- 有하니 死者의 飛揚을 夢想하는 等 果然 鮮雅한 意趣의 存在를 可窺할지로다. 弁韓은 辰韓과 相同하나
國有瑟, 其形如筑, 彈之有音, 曲與胡琴類.
伽倻琴의 始原을 弁韓時代에 本有하얏나니 由此觀之면 또한 그 人民의 性品과 情操를 想像하기에 裕餘하도다. 眞實로 樂天的 氣分을 幷稟한 者인뎌.

其4 馬韓
世人 中에는 馬韓을 箕子의 後裔인 箕準이 創建한 者와 如히 傳하는 者- 有하나 當世의 南鮮地方은 비록 艶麗한 淸溪間에 介在하야 各各 小國을 建立하얏슴에 不過하얏스나 또한 可히 羣雄割據時代라 稱할만한 者-니 衛滿과 如한＜25＞ 弱小한 外賊은 擊退치 못하고 南奔의 恥를 不得已 作한 箕準의 微衰로서 어찌 馬韓의 王이 됨을 得하얏슬 者-리오.
此亦 一小幽谷에서 自稱의 帝王을 作하엿섯슴을 可推할지로다. 此에 論함은 倍達族의 後裔가 本立한 馬韓의 文化임을 特히 注意할진뎌.
馬韓其民土著種植, 散在山海間, 無城郭, 居處作草屋, 土室形如家, 其戶在上, 擧家共在其中.
考하야 그 生活狀態가 아즉도 未開함을 不免하얏섯다할지나 何如컨 그의 自然스러운 것이엇슴은 可히 想像할지며
官家使築城郭, 諸年少勇健者, 皆鑿脊皮以大繩貫之, 又以丈許木揷之, 通日懽呼, 作力不以爲痛, 旣以勸作且以爲健, 雖有鬪爭攻戰, 而貴相屈服.
人性의 質直하고 彊勇함이 如斯하얏도다.
不貴金寶錦罽. 唯重瓔珠, 以綴衣爲飾, 及懸頭垂耳, 大率皆魁頭露紒, 布袍草履
그 無瑕純粹한 裝飾品의 旣盛行用되엇슴은 同히 讚嘆에 値할만한 者-로다.
常以五月下種訖, 祭鬼神 晝夜酒會羣聚歌舞, 舞輒數十人俱起相隨蹋地, 低昻手足相應節奏, 有似鐸聲, 十月農功畢, 亦復如之.
信鬼神, 國邑各立一人主祭天神, 名之天君, 又諸國各有別邑, 名之爲蘇塗, 立大木懸鈴鼓, 事鬼神.
不知騎乘牛馬, 畜者但以送葬. 其葬有棺無棹.
宗敎에 對한 觀念 等도 三韓을 通하야 大同小異하야 相類한 바-어니와 特히 馬韓人에 在하야는 北方의 質素한 性品과 南方의 歡樂한 情操를 幷存한 好代表가 되는 者-요 有棺無槨式의 葬法도 扶餘와 近似하도다.

第2 槪說
彫塑라 하면 넘우도 大膽하다 云할지나 國王의 葬用에 充키 爲하야 豫置하는 玉匣이 有한지라. 어찌 尋常한 者이 업스리오. 今에 其物을 對치 못하매 遽讚키는 猝難할지나 後世 高麗時代의 石槨으로써 推想할지라도 그 靑龍白虎와＜26＞ 唐草模樣 等 彫刻의 成造가 實로 稱嘆할만한 者- 허다커늘 又况 雄勢- 天下를 翻弄하든 當代 扶餘王의 遺骸를 奉納코저 하는 玉匣이랴. 至巧至妙하얏슴을 可量이며.
東沃沮의 木槨에서는 平民이 常用한 者의 一例를 得한 者니 長이 10餘丈에 至할 一大木槨 中에 1家族의 殘骨을 順次로 納入한지라. 그들의 誠과 精으로 造成되엇슬 그 木槨의 所重하며 所貴하야 如何한 意匠이 施現되엇든 것인지 可測할지오. 더구나 刻木 云云하엿스니 可히 此의 事實을 確證하는 바-로다.
玉璧과 圭瓚을 扶餘의 庫中에 藏納할새 國人이 傳世하야 貴寶를 삼앗스니 此도 漢代의 玉璧에 依據하야 推想할진대 또한 彫刻의 妙法이 夙起하얏섯스며
馬韓人의 金寶와 錦罽를 不貴타 하는 民人이 오히려 珠玉으로써 衣에 綴하며 首에 懸하야 그 身을 飾彩하얏스니 우리 倍達族이 未開한 時代에 在하야서도 藝術的 慧源을 本有한 證據로다.
鑄造는 4隣과 至於隔海한 倭에까지 貨幣를 供給한 辰韓과 嫁娶에 貴錢法이 잇던 東沃沮의 비록 無文錢일지나 鑄錢이 曾行하얏슴은 勿論이오. 濊貊의 男子가 廣이 數寸에 至하는 銀花를 繫하야 爲飾하얏다하며 扶餘의 婦人은 喪을 當하매 그 環珮를 去하얏스니 環과 珮의 如何한 者이엇든지는 其後 樂浪時代의 遺物로써 聯想키 不能한 者도 아닐지라. 또한 扶餘의 大人은 金銀으로써 飾帽하얏다 云하니 何如間 鐵外에 金銀 等 貴金屬의 鑄造法도 旣有하도다.
扶餘人은 食飮에 俎豆를 用하얏스니 梓工의 發達을 可知요. 東沃沮는 其俗이 瓦䥶에 精米를 藏하야 槨戶之邊에 編懸하얏다하니 瓦䥶은 今日에도 三南地方의 農民이 常用하되 其形이 倭鼎과 恰似하며 濊貊의 古地인 江原道 江陵 附近에서 發掘한 陶器의 壺와 如한 者는 그 質實과 色彩가 幽邃高遠하야 可히 後者의 模標가 될만할지니 當代에 陶業術이 旣熟하얏슴은 다만 驚嘆不己할 뿐이로다.
扶餘의 宮室과 倉庫 牢獄은 그 影跡쪼차 漠然하니 그의 構成과 刻飾의 如何는 不可論이나 沃沮의 舊地에서 發見하는 平瓦의 形質과 그 表裏의 紋樣을 볼진대 製瓦業은 次요. 此를 常用하얏든 當世의 建築術의 如何를 推量할 者인뎌.
織造로는 辰韓의 縑布일지니 絹絲를 數兼하야 織成할새 當代에 이미 得名한 者이엇스며 扶餘人의 出國함에 繒繡錦罽를 崇尙하얏다 하니 또한 一適例라 云할지로다.
然則 文獻을 不可考라는 古代에 설지나 如斯히 豐麗한 藝術的 慧源이 彫塑, 鑄造, 建築 等을 通하야 漏發하얏도다.＜27＞
