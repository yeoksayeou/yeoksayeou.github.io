The Giant of the Masses - A Biography of Son Ŭiam Sŏnsaeng
						One Reporter
A Matter of Deep Emotion
They say the Teacher (先生; Sŏnsaeng) has entered eternal sleep. They say the Teacher entered eternal sleep at 3 AM on May 19th, when a sudden shower poured down and the darkness of a new day still enveloped Changch'unwŏn outside Tongdaemun Gate. Though the new green leaves of Changch'unwŏn remained fresh and the chirping of birds harmonious, only the Teacher's breath grew utterly quiet, and only the Teacher's pupils grew utterly dim.
"Do you think I will die? Would it matter if I died...?" His unfinished words still linger in the ears of this reporter writing these lines. Alas, what is this? When I turn my head to the East, only the cloudy sky stretches vast and empty.
I have now taken up my brush, intending to briefly record the Teacher's life. But before putting the brush down, tears of emotion flow. Ah, with my heart so sorrowful, how can I finish this record?

On the 25th day of the 5th month, Imsul year (1922), the 6th day since the Teacher passed away.
The Magnanimity of the Teacher's Youth
He was the illegitimate son (庶子; sŏja) of a lowly clerk (賤吏; ch'ŏlli) in Ch'ŏngju.
The Teacher's given name was Pyŏnghŭi (秉熙), his father's name was Ŭijo (懿祖), his mother was Lady Ch'oe (崔氏), and Ŭiam (義菴) was the religious name (道號; toho) received from his own teacher, Ch'oe Haewŏl (崔海月). He was born 61 <75> years ago on the 8th day of the 4th month, Sinyu year (1861), in Taeju-ri, Ch'ŏngju County, North Ch'ungch'ŏng Province.
His father, a commoner of Ch'ŏngju, spent his life in frustration and discontent, serving in a minor clerical post (吏房; ibang). Regarding his mother, Lady Ch'oe, nothing particular is passed down, but inferring from her position as the secondary wife (庶室; sŏsil) in the Son household, it seems she too possessed a somewhat unusual character for a woman and encountered many complex situations. It appears much of the Teacher's unique natural talent (天稟; ch'ŏnp'um) was inherited from both his parents.
As many people witnessed firsthand, the Teacher had a heroic appearance and a broad-minded, brilliant spirit. From childhood, his piercing gaze (炯炯한 眼光) astonished those around him. However, because his family lineage was unremarkable, and moreover, he was an illegitimate son, he was treated poorly within the family, and venturing out, the neighborhood did not accept him. His innate feelings grew even more intense because of this. Though he briefly studied classical Chinese (漢文; Hanmun) in his youth, he disdained it and soon abandoned it. As he grew older, unable to restrain his magnanimous and untamed nature (豪放不覇; hopang pulp'a), he devoted himself to drinking (飮酒; ŭmju) and gambling (鬪錢; tuch'ŏn). He passed nearly twenty springs amidst disputes, fights (鬪鬨; tuhong), singing, laughing, and shouting (歌吟笑呼; kaŭm soho). According to the oral accounts of old friends who associated with him then, the Teacher's life around the age of twenty was dissipated like that. Yet even amidst that dissipation, there seemed to be something inviolable about him. When drinking, he prevailed through drink; when engaging in miscellaneous skills (雜技; chapki), he prevailed through skill and strategy; when settling physical fights, he prevailed through physical strength (膂力; yŏryŏk) and spirit (氣魄; kip'aek). Not only that, but at drinking parties, he controlled his drinking companions, and standing in the gambling dens, he controlled the ruffians (乾達; kŏndal). These two characteristics—prevailing and controlling—could be seen wherever the Teacher found himself, in large and small situations alike, it is said. I will now select and record a few anecdotes left from that time to show the contours of the Teacher's feelings and actions back then.

When the Teacher was 12, in the Imsin year (1872), his elder brother had him carry 40 nyang of leaf coins (葉錢; yŏpchŏn) to deliver to the government office. On the way, the Teacher saw a person frozen and near death. He immediately carried the person himself to a tavern, laid him in a warm room, and gave the money he possessed to the owner to arrange for treatment. The family was astonished at his strong sense of righteous rescue (義救; ŭigu), it is said.
When he was 17, in the Chŏngch'uk year (1877), the Teacher went to Samga-ri, Koean County. At that time, a royal envoy (修信使; susinsa) arrived, and behind his horse, a station functionary (驛人; yŏgin) was being dragged, bleeding profusely. The Teacher shouted, "How can a person abuse another like this?" He immediately struck the horse servant (馬僕; mabok) with a wooden stick, made him release the suspended man, <76> snatched the envoy's dispatch tube (諭書桶; yusŏt'ong), and threw it into a pond, it is said.
Also this year, as the Teacher was passing through a neighboring town, the villagers were sitting around making a racket. The Teacher overheard their words: in a certain household in their village, there were 5 family members, but due to an infectious disease, the entire household had perished. Five or six days had passed, but the villagers, fearing infection, had still not collected the bodies and were discussing how to handle the aftermath. The Teacher lamented, "If people do not rescue the dead of other people, who will?" He personally shrouded the five bodies and then buried them together with the villagers, it is said.

A Turning Point of Mind: The Teacher's New Life
Entered Tonghak for the First Time at Age 22
His early twenties were a very dangerous period in the Teacher's life. Would he become a kind of recluse (逸民; ilmin) who failed to find a purpose, ending his life in the sorrowful state of drunken revelry? Or would he become the leader of a band of audacious thieves (豪賊; hojŏk), carrying a far-seeing mirror on his back and wielding a sword of discontent, plundering castles and seizing wealth? Or, knowing none of this, would he become just a village troublemaker (悖子; p'aeja), living out his life decaying like grass and trees? Such speculations were likely how the elders of the time assessed the Teacher then. Indeed, around the age of twenty, the Teacher must have felt stifled. His ambition (志; chi) was great, but there was no path to implement it; his courage (勇; yong) was strong, but there was no opportunity to display it. The tyranny of corrupt officials (貪官汚吏; t'amgwan ori), the ugliness of social traditions—seeing them offended his eyes, thinking about them stirred his anger, but he dared not do anything. The Teacher's spirit (氣; ki) must have been frustrated, his mind (心; sim) disordered. But then, a ray of light, a path to new life, shone upon the Teacher.
It was when he was 22 years old. A believer in Tonghak (東學) urged the Teacher to enter the Way (道; To). Persuasion about avoiding the "three disasters and eight calamities" (三災八亂; samjae p'allan) was too shallow to move the Teacher's will, but the explanation that the true principles of "assisting the nation and comforting the people" (輔國安民; Poguk anmin) and "widely saving all living beings" (廣濟蒼生; Kwangje ch'angsaeng) were encompassed within it deeply moved the Teacher's heart. Thereupon, with firm resolve, the Teacher immediately entered the Way. With this, the Teacher's mind and spirit underwent a transformation (心氣 一轉; simgi ilchŏn), and his life was renewed (生活 一新; saenghwal ilsin). He silently acknowledged that his previously unrestrained life had greatly led his mind and character astray, and he became convinced that the accomplishment of great deeds originates first from the sound character of the protagonist managing the affair. The Teacher then closed his door, <77> knelt on his mat, and devoted all his energy to "guarding the mind and rectifying the spirit" (守心正氣; Susim chŏnggi) according to the Tonghak procedures for cultivating the Way (修道; sudo). How earnestly the Teacher cultivated his mind and character at this time can be well inferred from a single incident: when a missionary (傳道人; chŏndoin) of the time heard that the Tonghak Teacher, Ch'oe Haewŏl, had come nearby and intended to have Sŏnsaeng perform the ritual of paying respects (拜謁; paeal), Sŏnsaeng said, "Until I have reformed my unrestrained mind, I cannot see the Teacher."
In the 24th year, Kapchin (甲申 - typo in original, should be Kapsin 甲申, 1884), when the Teacher first paid respects at the gate of Ch'oe Haewŏl, the second leader (敎主; Kyoju) of Tonghak, they solemnly pledged the bond of master and disciple (師弟; saje). Following Teacher Ch'oe's guidance entirely to achieve great virtue and accomplishment, from then on, he never left Teacher Ch'oe's side, sharing joys and sorrows (休戚; hyuch'ik). When traveling, he carried the Teacher's sedan chair (乘轎; sŭnggyo); when lodging, he guarded the Teacher's door, consistent from beginning to end (始終如一; sijong yŏril).
When he was 30, in the Kyŏngin year (1890), the Teacher resided in Chin'chŏn County, established rules for cultivating the Way, set 21 days as one period, and recited the incantation (呪文; chumun) (Serving the Heavenly Lord, Creation is Fixed, Eternally Unforgettable, Knowing All Things - 侍天主造化定永世不忘萬事知) one million times. He did so without lying down or sleeping (不臥不寐; purwa pulmi) until completion (訖工; kilkong). He did this three times that year. He also made it his daily task (日課; ilgwa) to weave two pairs of straw sandals (屨; ku), never changing this routine. People of the time called him "Son Hakcha" (孫學者; Son the Scholar).
In short, during the 13 years from entering Tonghak at age 22 until reaching age 34 in Kyesa year (1893), the Teacher first focused on nurturing the mind (心養; simyang) and cultivating character (性修; sŏngsu), striving to mend the wounds induced by the dissipated life of his early twenties. Furthermore, he spread his beliefs to many people around him, gaining quite a few disciples (徒弟; todo). At the same time, notably, the Teacher's outstanding natural talent (天稟; ch'ŏnp'um) and the sincerity and devotion (精篤; chŏngdok) of his body and mind earned the trust (信任; sinim) of his teacher (其師; kisa), Ch'oe Haewŏl. The foundation for him becoming the future leader (指導者; chidoja) of Tonghak was laid during this time; this is a particularly noteworthy event from that period. Now, I will represent the Teacher's activities (行蹟; haengjŏk) during that time with a couple of anecdotes.

This happened when he was 29. At this time, criticism (指目; chimok) against Tonghak was intensifying daily. Son Ch'ŏnmin, a Tonghak leader and also the Teacher's nephew (從姪; chongjil), was also targeted and could not enter his home. When constables (校卒; kyojol) arrested his wife, the Teacher happened to be nearby and suddenly raised his voice fiercely (勃然厲聲; pŏryŏn yesŏng), saying, "How does arresting the wife compare to arresting the uncle? I am Ch'ŏnmin's uncle!" The constables then arrested the Teacher instead. When brought to Chusŏng Station in Ch'ŏngju County, the Teacher drank eight cups of wine consecutively and said, "I am very drunk and cannot walk. You must carry me," then sat down and refused to move. The constables had no choice but to carry the Teacher to the Ch'ŏngju Garrison (鎭營; chinyŏng). During interrogation (考招; koch'o), when asked about Ch'oe Haewŏl's whereabouts (所在; sojae), he replied, "Since I have <78> already presented myself, resolved on life or death, how could there be any reason for me to divulge the Teacher's location?" He maintained a resolute expression and did not waver (正色不動; chŏngsaek pudong). The garrison commander (營將; yŏngjang), moved by his righteous demeanor (義風; ŭip'ung), immediately released him (放釋; pangsŏk).
This happened when he was 32. The Teacher was traveling and, as night fell, stopped at a tavern. The owner was only a woman; her husband was away. Late at night, the tavern woman offered him wine. The Teacher said, "I have already quit drinking (斷飮; tanŭm)." She then offered tobacco. "I have already quit smoking (斷吸; tanhŭp)." She tried again to tempt him with allure. "I have already sworn off desire (斷慾; tanyok)." The woman turned pale and said, "Why are you so severe?" The Teacher replied, "I have a lifelong undertaking and have been diligently observing戒持; kyeji) these precepts for a long time. Drinking wine is harmful (是害; sihae), eating meat is harmful, smoking tobacco is harmful, and indulging in women is harmful. Therefore, I act thus." His resolve (決心; kyŏlsim) was indeed so firm (鞏固; konggo).
At this time, those so-called yangban (兩班) made it their business to advocate (標榜; p'yobang) for the prohibition of Tonghak and forcibly seize (强奪; kangt'al) the property of believers (道人; toin). A believer named Han Yŏngsŏk had 3,000 nyang of money and one cow plundered by Kwŏn Yongch'ŏl. The Teacher immediately confronted Kwŏn, rebuked him for his injustice (不意; pŭrŭi), retrieved the property and cow, and returned them to Han. Such incidents were reportedly too numerous to count (其回 不許; kihwe purhŏ).

The Kap'o (1894) Revolution and the Teacher's Fierce Battle
In the Teacher's heart, there was only fervent blood for the people (民衆; minjung). Moreover, the tyrannical government (暴政; p'okchŏng), inferior system (劣等; yŏltŭng), and monstrous customs (怪惡 慣習; kwaeak kwansŭp) of the time provoked the Teacher's feelings. Subsequently, the popular uprising that began in Kobu ignited the Teacher's righteous indignation (義憤; ŭibun).
In the 10th month of Kap'o year (1894), when he was 34, the Teacher, having obtained the consent of Ch'oe Haewŏl, the second leader of Tonghak, led a hundred thousand followers (徒衆; tojung) raised by 315 leaders including Son Ch'ŏnmin, Kim Yŏn'guk, Yi Yonggu, Pak Inho, and Kim Kaenam from areas such as Kobu, Okku, Chŏngŭp, T'aein, Man'gyŏng, Kimje, Kim'gu, Koch'ang, Mujang, Muan, Imsil, Namwŏn, Sun'ch'ang, Muju, Puan, Changhŭng, Tamyang, Ch'angp'yŏng, Iksan, Changsŏng, Nŭngju, Kwangju, Posŏng, Naju, Kangjin, Haenam, Changsu, Yŏnggwang, Yŏsan, Kosan, Chinsan, Kŭmsan, Koksŏng, Chŏnju, Sunch'ŏn, Kwangju (Gyeonggi), Ch'ŏngju, Ch'ungju, An'sŏng, Yŏju, Yanggŭn, Chip'yŏng, Wŏnju, Hoengsŏng, Hongch'ŏn, Sŏsan, Tŏksan, Tangjin, T'aean, Anmyŏndo, Namp'o, Chinju, Konyang, Hadong, Namhae, Tansŏng, Sach'ŏn, Haeju, Songhwa, Sinch'ŏn, Chaeryŏng, P'ungch'ŏn, Changyŏn, Munhwa, Anak, etc. They first rendezvoused with Chŏn Pongjun in Kongju and raised the torch (矩火; kuhwa) of revolution under the banner of "cleansing the political world" (政界廓淸; chŏnggye kwakch'ŏng) and "defending the people's rights" (民權擁護; minkwŏn ongho). Prior to this, tens of thousands of Tonghak followers, <79> mourning the unjust execution (無罪就戮; mujoe ch'wi'ryuk) of the founding teacher (先師; Sŏnsa), Ch'oe Suun (Ch'oe Cheu), and angered by the lawless tyranny (亂法橫暴; nanpŏp hoengp'o) of corrupt officials (貪官汚吏; t'amgwan ori), had repeatedly sought to raise the banner of justice (正義 火旗; chŏng'ŭi hwagi). However, their teacher, Ch'oe Haewŏl, concerned that the opportunity (機; ki) was not yet ripe and worried about the lack of firm unity (團結 不鞏; tan'gyŏl pulgong), awaited a future day when "time and wind would send" (時來風送; sirae p'ungsong). Now, finally, the time had come, the people united, and they launched a "do-or-die" (乾坤一擲; kŏn'gon ilch'ŏk) popular movement (民衆運動; minjung undong). The Teacher, alongside Chŏn Pongjun at the time, was the sole leader (唯一 指導者; yuil chidoja) of this campaign and a courageous vanguard (先鋒; sŏnbong) who stood alone amidst rifles and cannons (銃砲; ch'ongp'o). (Regarding the Kap'o campaign, its outline was briefly described in issues 22 and 23 of this magazine under the title "The Kap'o Reform Movement," so it is not detailed further here.)
At this time, the popular army (民軍; min'gun) was fiercely motivated but lacked training (操鍊; choryŏn). Furthermore, the battle of Kongju was their first engagement, so having gained no experience (經驗; kyŏnghŏm), they suffered a disadvantage against the government troops (官軍; kwan'gun) and retreated to Nonsan. The Teacher then passed through Iksan, Chŏnju, Kim'gu, T'aein, Chŏngŭp, Kobu (右阜-typo for 古阜), Changsŏng, Sun'ch'ang, and Imsil, crushed (大破; taep'a) Yi Ŭngbaek's popular fortress army (民堡軍; minbogun) in Muju, and again encountered government troops at Yongsansi, Yŏngdong County. At that time, a thick fog (大霧; taemu) filled the sky, and the government troops had already surrounded them several layers deep (包圍; p'owi), making the situation perilous (岌嶪; kŭbŏp). The Teacher commanded the dedicated followers (結社 道衆; kyŏlsa tojung) and fought fiercely, repelling them (力戰擊退; yŏkchŏn kyŏkt'oe). However, in this battle, a stray bullet (流丸; yu'hwan) tore through the Teacher's robe (周衣; chuŭi), and his fate (運命; unmyŏng) truly hung like a candle in the wind (風前燈火; p'ungjŏn tŭnghwa).
From then on, the Teacher moved his forces to Ch'ŏngju, Ch'ungju, and other areas, fighting and resting intermittently (且戰 且休; ch'ajŏn ch'ahyu). However, as the year turned to Ŭlmi (1895), the government (政府; chŏngbu) borrowed troops (借兵; chabyŏng) from Japan and conducted large-scale subjugation (剿伐; ch'obŏl). The untrained Tonghak army (道人軍; toin'gun) could not withstand them and collapsed everywhere. First, Kim Kaenam was killed (被殺; p'isal) in Chŏnju, and Chŏn Pongjun was arrested (逮捕; ch'aep'o) and taken to Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul). With the overall situation (大勢; taese) already lost, the Teacher, together with the remaining followers (殘餘 道衆; chanyŏ tojung), pledged to regroup and return someday (捲土重來; kwŏnt'o chungnae). He went to Wŏnsan via Kangwŏn Province, sold a pair of glasses he possessed to prepare food and clothing, disguised himself as an itinerant merchant (行商; haengsang), and temporarily took refuge (暫避; champ'i) in the central region (Chungch'ŏng province area). (This was in the 6th month of Ŭlmi year).
Later, entering Pyŏngsin year (1896), the appearances and disappearances (出沒; ch'ulmol) of government troops ceased, and the southern roads began to open (南路始通; namno sit'ong). Under the guidance of his teacher, Ch'oe Haewŏl, the Teacher dedicated himself (專務; chŏnmu) to gathering (收拾; susup) the believers (道人; toin) scattered in various places. Amidst harsh criticism (怪惡 指目; kwaeak chimok) and the dangerous rain of cannon fire (險亂 砲雨; hŏmnan p'ou), he managed to be sincere (誠實; sŏngsil) and fight hard (奮鬪; puntu), achieving results (實績; silchŏk) everywhere. His teacher, Ch'oe Haewŏl, particularly praised the Teacher's faithfulness and righteousness (信義; sinŭi), saying, "Son's faithfulness and righteousness are unparalleled in the world (天下無雙; ch'ŏnha mussang)," and bestowed upon him the religious name (道號; toho) Ŭiam. The following year, Chŏngyu (1897), he further received the religious lineage (道統; tot'ong) from Teacher Haewŏl and became the third leader (敎主; Kyoju) of Tonghak. At this time, the Teacher was 37 years old. <80>
During the 8 years from age 34 (Kap'o, 1894) to age 41 (Sin Ch'uk, 1901), the Teacher was busy promoting (促成; ch'oksŏng) the Kap'o Revolution and dealing with its aftermath (收拾; susup). That the affair ultimately ended in failure (失敗; silp'ae) was due to fate (運; un) and circumstances (勢; se), needless to say. Regardless, the Teacher did all he could (盡爲; chinwi). Now, I will record a few anecdotes (逸事; ilsa) from that period to compensate for the inadequacy (杜撰; tuch'an) of this record.

This happened during the Kap'o campaign, when they retreated from Kongju and were stationed (屯; tun) in Nonsan. One day, the various believers stationed in Nonsan became agitated, saying, "The leaders (頭領; turyŏng), without any supernatural power (造化; chohwa), have led the masses into chaos (亂; nan). It would be better to kill them first." Their momentum became rampant (猖獗; ch'anggwŏl). The Teacher suddenly climbed Panwŏl Mountain, addressed the assembled army, and said, "If you do not believe in supernatural power, shoot me all at once!" The crowd all prostrated themselves (俯伏; pubok), it is said. (Note: Many believers at the time believed solely in the leaders' supernatural powers).
This happened in the Ŭlmi year (1895). The Teacher was accompanying (陪; pae) Haewŏl and staying at the house of Ch'oe Yŏngsŏ in Inje County. Yŏngsŏ was poor and found it difficult to provide food (供饋; konggwe) for many people. The Teacher, along with his younger brother Pyŏnghŭm (秉欽), disguised themselves as merchants and went to the inn (客店; kaekchŏm) of a certain Mr. Yi in Apchin-ri, Kansŏng County. They didn't have a single penny (囊中에 1錢의 所持가 無하얏다). At that time, a man named Yun Kyuch'il, who lived in the vicinity, was impressed by the Teacher's bearing (儀表; ŭip'yo) and volunteered (自請; chach'ŏng) to bestow upon him a thousand gold pieces (千金; ch'ŏn'gŭm) as a gift (施惠; sihye). He produced a note (票; p'yo) for one thousand nyang, instructing him to collect it (推尋; ch'uch'im) from the Wŏnsan commission merchant (客主; kaekchu). When the Teacher firmly refused (固辭; kosa), Mr. Yun also would not listen (不聽; pulch'ŏng) and simply returned home. At this point, Pyŏnghŭm said, "We have no prior acquaintance (親誼; ch'inŭi) with Mr. Yun, yet his showing such deep affection (厚愛; huae) truly stems from Heaven's will (天意; ch'ŏnŭi). How about accepting it to provide for the Divine Teacher (神師; Sinsa - referring to Ch'oe Haewŏl)?" The Teacher forbade it, saying, "We tried to save (求; ku) the people of Chosŏn from fire and water (水火中; suhwajung), but instead caused hundreds of thousands of good people (良民; yangmin) to become spirits (魂; hon) under cannon fire (砲火; p'ohwa) and sword points (劒頭; kŏmdu). Even if we must endure wind and sleep in the dew (風餐露宿; p'ungch'an nosuk), we cannot scheme (圖謀; tomo) for our own comfort (苟且히 安身키; kuch'ahi ansin'k'i). How could I accept this money?" That night, he wrote (修; su) a letter, sent the money order back to its owner, and headed alone towards Wŏnsan, it is said.
This also happened during the uprising (亂中; nanjung). As the Teacher was passing through Ch'ŏngsan from Nonsan, an attendant (從者; chongja) informed him, "The Teacher's family (家族; kajok) is in this place. How about visiting them briefly?" The Teacher replied, "Who doesn't have affection (愛情; aejŏng) for their family? However, now the families of many people are scattered (散在; sanjae) amidst the chaos, their life or death unknown (生死不知; saengsa puji). How could I alone privately see (私見; sagyŏn) my wife and children (妻子; ch'ŏja)?" He passed by the gate without entering (過門不入; kwagmun purip), it is said. <81>

The Failure of Kyemyo (1903) and the Reorganization of Kapchin (1904)
Defeated (見敗; kyŏnp'ae) in the Kap'o Movement, the Teacher afterwards focused all his efforts on gathering the believers, awaiting a future day to regroup. However, another such opportunity (機會; kihwe) did not easily arise. Moreover, ever since the turmoil (一自經亂 以後; ilcha kyŏngnan ihu), local government offices (地方官廳; chibang kwanch'ŏng) viewed Tonghak followers with even greater jealousy (嫉視; chilsi) or contempt (輕視; kyŏngsi), and persecution (虐待; haktae) intensified daily (日苛; ilga). Ch'oe Haewŏl, the second Tonghak leader, was executed by strangulation (處絞; ch'ŏgyo) in Kyŏngsŏng in the summer of Musul year (1898). As the remaining persecution (餘虐; yŏ'ak) was still severe (猶甚; yusim), the Teacher not only knew he couldn't achieve anything meaningful (有爲; yuwi) within the country for the time being (當分間; tangbun'gan), but also perceived (察; ch'al) that Western civilization's trends (歐米 文明風潮; Kumi munmyŏng p'ungjo) were flowing into the East (東方; Tongbang) and the situation in the East (東洋 局面; Tong'yang kukmyŏn) was about to undergo a complete transformation (一新一變; ilsin ilbyŏn). He decided to first travel the world (天下 遊歷; ch'ŏnha yuryŏk) himself to directly ascertain (推察; ch'uch'al) the nature of modern civilization and the state of world affairs (世界 大勢; segye taese). Then, seizing the opportunity (機 乘; ki sŭng), he would undertake action (事 擧; sa kŏ). Entrusting (一任; irim) all major and minor matters (大小事; taesosa) of the Way (道中; Tojung) to the various leaders (諸頭目; che tumok) in the home country (本國; Pon'guk), he changed his name (變名; pyŏnmyŏng) to Yi Sanghŏn (李祥憲) and headed first for Nagasaki, Japan, intending to go to America (米國; Miguk). This was in the 3rd month of Sinch'uk year (1901).
However, due to insufficient travel funds (旅費 不足; yŏbi pujok), he could not achieve this (不果; pulgwa) and stayed temporarily (滯留; ch'eryu) in Japan. As circumstances arose where the royal court (朝廷; chojŏng) might summon him by imperial decree (勅令 召致; ch'iknyŏng soch'i), he again hid himself in Shanghai. It was apparently during this time (while staying in Japan) that he corresponded (其文 通; kimun t'ong) with Korean political exiles (國事犯; kuksa pŏm) like Pak Yŏnghyo (朴泳孝), Kwŏn Tongjin (權東鎭), Cho Hŭiyŏn (趙羲淵), and Yi Chinho (李軫鎬).
How could the seat of a pioneer (先驅者; sŏn'guja) be warm? How could the path (突; tol - likely path/way) of a man of the hour (風雲兒; p'ung'un'a) be smooth (黔; kŏm - lit. black, likely smooth/unobstructed)? For various reasons, the Teacher, unable to sit still (坐不安席; chwa puransŏk), returned to Korea (還國; hwan'guk) via Wŏnsan harbor in the 10th month of that year. The following year, Imin (1902), accompanied (同伴; tongban) by 24 students (書生; sŏsaeng), he went to Japan, enrolled them in various schools (就學; ch'wihak), and then quietly observed (鑑察; kamch'al) the brewing storm (風雲; p'ung'un) in the East while organizing (團束; tansok) the believers (敎徒; kyodo) back home.
It was the summer of Kyemyo year (1903, Meiji 36). At that time in the Korean government (朝鮮政府; Chosŏn chŏngbu), the pro-conservative and pro-Russian faction (守舊便 親露黨; sukubyŏn ch'illodang) led by Yi Yunyong (李允用) was in power (用事; yongsa), and national affairs (國政; kukchŏng) were worsening daily (日非; ilbi). In Japan, from top to bottom (日本上下; Ilbon sangha), there was worry and anger (是憂是憤; siu sibun) about Russia's eastward aggression (露國 極東 侵略; Noguk kŭktong ch'imnyak), and they seemed to be preparing (準備; chunbi) to declare war on Russia (對露國宣戰; tae Noguk sŏnjŏn). It was truly an autumn of many troubles in East Asia (東亞多事 秋; Tong'a tasa ch'u). The Teacher thought to himself (自思; chasa): a clash between Japan and Russia (日露 衝突; Il-Lo ch'ungdol) is unavoidable due to the larger situation (大勢 所不免; taese so pulmyŏn). If they clash, for the future (將來; changnae) of East Asia, Japan must achieve victory (其勝 不得 不可; kisŭng pudŭk pulga). However, even if Japan wins, it won't necessarily benefit Chosŏn itself (朝鮮 自體 利益; Chosŏn chach'e iik). Therefore, at this juncture (此際; ch'aje), we must preemptively seize the opportunity (其機 先制; kigi sŏnje). First, cooperate (協力; hyŏmnyŏk) with Japan to expel (排除; paeje) Russia. Then, with the remaining influence from acting as equals with Japan (約同等 餘威; yaktongdŭng yŏwi), reform (維新; yusin) all aspects (萬般; manban) of Chosŏn and advance to determine (定; chŏng) the situation in East and West (東西 局面; tongsŏ kukmyŏn). The Teacher discussed this with Kwŏn Tongjin and Cho Hŭiyŏn. Kwŏn and Cho conveyed this intention to Japan's <82> Chief of the General Staff (參謀總長; ch'ammo ch'ongjang) at the time, Tamura Iyozō (田村怡與助). Tamura quickly obtained the tacit approval (內認; naein) of the relevant authorities (關係當局; kwan'gye tangguk) and met with the Teacher, secretly deciding (暗定; amjŏng) on the grand plan (大計; taegye) for before and after. The essentials (要; yo) of the plan were generally as follows (大槪 如下; taege yŏha):
First, have Japanese soldiers (日本兵士; Ilbon pyŏngsa) disguise themselves as merchants (商人 變裝; sang'in pyŏnjang) and secretly enter non-treaty ports (不通商港; pult'ongsang hang). Then, together with Tonghak believers (東學 道衆; Tonghak tojung), rise up simultaneously (齊聲並起; chesŏng pyŏnggi), directly attack (直히 衝擊; chiki ch'unggyŏk) Kyŏngsŏng, eliminate (除; che) the pro-Russian faction (露黨; Nodang) in the government at the time. After elimination, on one hand, reform internal affairs (內政 革新; naejŏng hyŏksin), and on the other, dispatch a large army (大軍 出; taegun ch'ul) to jointly repel (共히 擊退; konghi kyŏkt'oe) Russia with Japan. At this time, the Japanese side (日本側; Ilbon ch'ŭk) was not without concern (念慮; yŏmnyŏ) that if they combined their strength (其力 合; kiryŏk hap) with Chosŏn like this to eliminate Russia, the post-war gains and merits (戰後 利功; chŏnhu igong) might not solely accrue (偏歸; p'yŏn'gwi) to themselves. However, the situation (情形; chŏnghyŏng) at the time was such that Japan greatly feared (甚히 畏懼; simhi wik'u) Russia's wealth and power (富强; pugang), while simultaneously not being certain of victory (戰勝 必期; chŏnsŭng p'ilgi). Furthermore, during this time, the sentiment towards Japan throughout Chosŏn (朝鮮 全國 日本 對 向背; Chosŏn chŏn'guk Ilbon tae hyangbae) would be the ultimate factor deciding their own final destiny (結局 運命 決 最後; kyŏlguk unmyŏng kyŏl ch'oehu). Therefore, despite realizing (覺悟; kak'o) they might not monopolize (專有; chŏnyu) the post-war benefits, they sought to join hands (手 握; su ak) with the people of Chosŏn.
Having confirmed (確定; hwakchŏng) this grand conspiracy (大謀; taemo), the Teacher dispatched (委遣; wigyŏn) his younger brother Pyŏnghŭm to the home country, instructing him on the plan (策 授; ch'aek su) to proceed "thus and thus," and conveyed his intention (其意 傳; kiŭi chŏn) to the Tonghak believers (道儒; Toyu - refers to Tonghak believers) throughout the country, making preparations (準備 先行; chunbi sŏnhaeng) for a simultaneous uprising (一擧 奮應; ilgŏ pun'ŭng).
Alas! Was it Chosŏn's lack of fortune (無福; pok)? Or perhaps the Teacher's lack of fortune? On August 3rd of that year, Son Pyŏnghŭm, the mastermind (主腦者; chunoeja) and implementer (實行者; silhaengja) of this plot, died suddenly (急疾 沒; kŭpch'il mol) in Pusan. On the 5th, Tamura also died (又 沒; u mol). Condolence telegrams (吊電; chodyŏn) arrived simultaneously (一時 並至; ilsi pyŏngji). The Teacher wailed loudly (放聲慟哭; pangsŏng t'onggok) and refused to eat for three days (不食; pulsik). However, the Teacher was not discouraged (沮喪; chŏsang) by this, merely saying, "If the cause is just and the principle sound (事正理順; sa chŏng i sun), there will surely be a day of success (成; sŏng). Even if it doesn't succeed, I will just strive to the very end (最後; ch'oehu)." Renewing his determination to continue (厲志續行; yeji sokhaeng), the following year, Kapchin (1904), he had Yi Insuk deliver a letter (書 傳; sŏ chŏn) to the various leaders back home, instructing them to secretly organize (組織; chojik) a popular assembly (民會; Minhoe). On the other hand, he sent a long letter (長書 至; changsŏ chi) to the then government minister (政府大臣; chŏngbu taesin) Yi Yonghŏn (李容憲 - likely error for Yun Yong-sŏn 尹容善 mentioned earlier?), denouncing (彈劾; t'anhaek) the misgovernment (秕政; p'ijŏng). In April of the same year, he summoned (請; ch'ŏng) disciples (門徒; munto) Pak Inho and Hong Pyŏnggi (洪秉箕) to Japan. As preparation for undertaking the grand objective (大意 擧; taeŭi kŏ), he first ordered (命; myŏng) the believers in the provinces (地方道人; chibang toin) to cut their hair all at once (一齊 斷髮; ilche tanbal). He further conferred (議定; ŭijŏng) with Kwŏn Tongjin, O Sech'ang (吳世昌), and Cho Hŭiyŏn on the plan (計; kye) for assembling the believers (道人會集; toin hoejip). They decided on the name Chinbohoe (進步會; Progressive Society - meaning for the people of one nation to advance step-by-step together into the realm of civilization - 一國의 민으로 하야 步步齊進하야 文明의 域에 共躋하자는 意). They drafted its objectives (趣旨; ch'wiji), platform (綱領; kangnyŏng), and regulations (規則; kyuch'ik), and had Yi Yonggu (李容九), Pak Inho, Hong Pyŏnggi, Na Yonghwan (羅龍煥), Yi Chonghun (李鍾勳), Pak Hyŏngch'ae (朴衡采), Kuk Kilhyŏn (鞠吉賢), etc., lead the affair (其事 主; kisa chu). In the autumn, September of the same year, they held meetings throughout the country (全國 通 開會; chŏn'guk t'ong kaehoe). Prior to this, the provincial believers who uniformly cut their hair (其髮 斷; kibal tan), pledging themselves to death (死 自誓; sa chasŏ), truly reached the large number (多數; tasu) of 160,000. <83> Depending on the circumstances in some regions, they faced threats of cannon fire (砲火 威脅; p'ohwa wihyŏp), but they did not yield in the slightest (少毫 不屈; soho pulgul) and all achieved their objective without difficulty (無難 目的 達; munan mokchŏk tal).
At this time, the Chinbohoe further clarified its four platform points (4綱領; sa kangnyŏng) to the world (世 佈明; se p'omyŏng) and intensified its activities (活動 盛; hwaltong sŏng). In November of the same year, the Chinbohoe merged (合勢; hapse) with the Ilchinhoe (一進會; Advancement Society - formed earlier by politicians (政客; chŏnggaek) like Song Pyŏngjun (宋秉畯) and Yun Sihyŏng (尹始炳 - likely Yun Sibyŏng 尹始炳)), and its influence grew stronger (其勢 益張; kise ikchang).
Supplementary note: The four platform points of the Chinbohoe at that time were: 1. To consolidate (鞏固; konggo) the foundation (基礎; kich'o) of independence (獨立; tongnip). 2. To reform (改繕; kaesŏn) the government (政府; chŏngbu). 3. To protect (保護; poho) life and property (生命 財産; saengmyŏng chaesan). 4. To organize (整理; chŏngni) military and financial affairs (軍政 財政; kunjŏng chaejŏng).
Alas, how difficult it is to accomplish even one undertaking (事業 成就; saŏp sŏngch'wi), and how hard it is to trust (信任; sinim) even a few people. Setting aside judgment on the rightness or wrongness, good or evil (是非善惡 姑舍勿論; sibi sŏnak kosamullon) of their actions, a few members of the Ilchinhoe leadership (幹部; kanbu) at the time, excluding Yi Yonggu, defied the original intention (本意 違背; ponŭi wibae) of the Teacher, who directed strategy from afar in Japan (日本에서 地圖의 鞭을 執한; Ilbon'esŏ chidoŭi p'yŏnŭl chiphan - lit. holding the map's whip), took independent action (自由 行動 就; chayu haengdong ch'wi), and the overall situation and major affairs went awry (大勢大事 已非; taese taesa ibi).
The Teacher unavoidably resorted to a final organizing measure (最後 整理策; ch'oehu chŏngnich'aek). In the winter of the following year, Ŭlsa (1905), under the name of Ch'ŏndogyo (天道敎), he announced the separation (分析; punsŏk) of the church (敎會; kyohoe) to the world (天下 布告; ch'ŏnha p'ogo). The year after, Pyŏngo (1906), he returned to Korea from Japan (日本 歸國; Ilbon kwiguk), personally assumed (親掌; ch'injang) the duties (職務; chingmu) of Ch'ŏndogyo Great Way Master (天道敎 大道主; Ch'ŏndogyo Taedoju), and renewed (一新; ilsin) the church's appearance (面目; myŏnmok) and substance (內容; naeyong). He established the church's constitution (敎會 憲則 制定; kyohoe hŏnch'ik chejŏng), setting up a Central Headquarters (中央總部; Chung'ang ch'ongbu) in Kyŏngsŏng and Dioceses (敎區; kyogu) in the provinces. He implemented (實行; silhaeng) the systems of Siiil (侍日; Sijil - corresponding to the Christian Sabbath/禮拜日) and Sŏngmi (誠米; Sŏngmi - a fundamental economic measure for the church, where believers, according to the number of names [in the household], store and offer one spoonful of rice per meal - 敎人이 依名數하야 每食에 米 1匙式을 貯供케 하는 것). He further expelled from the church (黜敎; ch'ulgyo) the Ilchinhoe leaders (頭領; turyŏng) Yi Yonggu, Song Pyŏngjun, and 60 others (62 total), and focused his efforts (專力; chŏllyŏk) on expanding church affairs (敎務 擴張; kyomu hwakchang).

The Teacher's Emotion-Filled Later Years
His Work Half-Done, His Body Perished First
The situation (局面; kungmyŏn) changed rapidly (急轉; kŭpchŏn). From the Kyŏngsul year (1910) onwards (一自 庚戌 以後; ilcha Kyŏngsul ihu), the Teacher poured all his energy (全力 傾; chŏllyŏk kyŏng) internally into his own cultivation (自身 修煉; chasin suryŏn) and the solidarity (團束; tansok) of the believers (敎徒; kyodo), and externally into the promotion (振作; chinjak) of cultural enterprises (文化 事業; munhwa saŏp). The Teacher after Kap'o (1894), especially the Teacher after Kyemyo (1903), had experienced extreme disappointment (極度 落心; kŭkto naksim) and also excitement (興奮; hŭngbun). How many times must he have shed tears of sorrow (傷心 淚 揮; sangsim nu hwi) in the foul winds and morning drizzles (淫風 朝霾雨 夕; ŭmp'ung chomaeu sŏk - figurative expression for dark times)? How many times must he have been unable to suppress feelings of intense anger (激忿 情 禁; kyŏkpun chŏng kŭm)? Had it not been for his usual cultivation (平素 修養; p'yŏngso suyang), trials (試煉; siryŏn), and natural gifts (天稟; ch'ŏnp'um), it would have been utterly impossible (到底; todo) even to endure (堪支; kamji) such circumstances (境遇; kyŏng'u). Thinking back, it seems the Teacher <84> first felt the necessity of cultivating his own mind and body (自己 心身 對 修養 必要 感; chagi simsin tae suyang p'iryo kam), and then keenly felt (切感; chŏlgam) the necessity of cultivation for the general believers (一般 敎徒 修養 必要; ilban kyodo suyang p'iryo). Therefore, he soon relinquished (前章; chŏnjang - likely means passed on/yielded) the position of Great Way Master (大道主 職; Taedoju chik) to the current leader (現 敎主; hyŏn Kyoju) Pak Inho, and dedicated himself entirely (全無; chŏnmu) to construction in the spiritual sphere (精神的 方面 建設; chŏngsinchŏk pangmyŏn kŏnsŏl). In the 10th month of Musin year (1908), he went specifically (專往; chŏnwang) to Naewŏnam Hermitage (內院菴; Naewŏnam) at T'ongdosa Temple (通度寺) in Yangsan, conducted a 49-day prayer session (祈禱 行; kido haeng), and personally composed (親制; ch'inje) the *Múche Pŏpkyŏng* (無軆法經; Scripture of the Formless Law) and the *Hugyŏng* (後經; Latter Scripture) to prepare spiritual nourishment (靈粮 準備; yŏngnyang chunbi) for the believers. In Sinyu year (1911), together with the current leader Pak Inho and other officials (諸部員 공히; chebuwŏn konghi), he went specifically (專往; chŏnwang) to the sacred site (聖地; sŏngji) in Kyŏngju, viewed (拜觀; paegwan) the former residences (舊址; kuji) of the First Generation Ch'ŏndogyo Founder (天道敎 第1歲 敎祖; Ch'ŏndogyo che-ilse Kyojo) Ch'oe Suun and the Second Generation Leader (第2歲 敎主; che-ise Kyoju) Ch'oe Haewŏl. Later, in Ŭlmyo year (1915), he again conducted (又 行; u haeng) a 105-day prayer session (祈禱; kido). During this period of roughly 10 years (前後 約 10年 此間; chŏnhu yak simnyŏn ch'agan), the Teacher's virtuous work greatly matured (德業 大成; tŏgŏp taesŏng), and his mind and spirit became harmonious (心氣 俱和; simgi kuwha). Now, I will record a few lines of poetry (詩 數句; si sugu) composed during this time and one unusual event (異事 一; isa il) to attest (証; chŭng) to the maturation of his virtuous work.

A poem recited (吟; ŭm) after completing the work at T'ongdosa Temple in Yangsan says:
道過三天心自昏, 風動細波空作喧. 白雲以上白雲下, 上以也聽下以論.
(The Way passes three heavens, the mind naturally dims; Wind stirs fine waves, causing empty clamor. White clouds above, white clouds below; The higher listen, the lower discuss.)
Also says:
遍踏法界故家歸, 五色花葉簷外飛. 淸虛月色澹泊味, 空使主翁自足肥.
(Treading everywhere the Dharma realm, returning to the old home; Five-colored flower petals fly outside the eaves. Clear void moonlight, simple plain taste; Emptily makes the master himself content and plump.)
Also says:
世法百年苦, 聖法萬年愁
(Worldly law, a hundred years of suffering; Sacred law, ten thousand years of sorrow.)

And on November 7th, Kapchin year (甲寅 - Kap'in, 1914) (at age 54), as the Teacher received his meal table (食床 受; siksang su), the door happened to be open (문 개방; mun kaebang). Over 100 wild sparrows (野雀 首; yajak su) flew in and sat around (環坐; hwanjwa) the Teacher. The Teacher shared his rice (飯 分飼; pan punsa). The flock of sparrows (群雀; kunjak) perched on his knee (膝 좌; sŭl chwa) or landed on his hand (手 登; su tŭng) to receive and eat the rice. Early the next morning (翌日 早朝; igil chojo), about 10 mountain pheasants (山雉 首; sanch'i su) flew into the inner courtyard (內庭 飛入; naejŏng piip) and lingered playfully (游弋而歸; yuyigigwi) for about two hours before leaving. It seemed the Teacher's harmonious spirit (和氣; hwagi) extended even to birds (禽鳥 及; kŭmjo kŭp).
Furthermore, regarding cultivation (修養; suyang) for the believers, he had them observe (奉行; ponghaeng) 21-day, 49-day, and 105-day prayer sessions (祈禱 等; kido tŭng) from time to time. He especially gathered key local leaders (地方 主要 頭目 會同; chibang chuyo tumok hoedong), chose quiet places (閒寂 處 擇; hanjŏk ch'ŏ t'aek), and had them conduct special prayer sessions (特別祈禱 行; t'ŭkpyŏl kido haeng) several times. Also, once each year (每歲 1次式; maese ilch'assik), he gathered large numbers of provincial believers (地方敎徒 多數 集合; chibang kyodo tasu chiphap) and delivered various sermons (幾多 法說 演述; kida pŏpsŏl yŏnsul) such as the "Theory of Transforming Character through the Body" (以身換性說; Isin hwansŏngsŏl), "Theory of the Emergence of the Great Divine Teacher's (Ch'oe Suun's) Spirit" (大神師 性靈出世說; Taesinsa Sŏngnyŏng ch'ulsesŏl), "Theory of the Opening of Human Culture" (人文開闢說; Inmun kaebyŏksŏl), "Unification of Faith" (信仰統一; Sin'ang t'ong'il), "Conformity of Structure" (規模一致; Kyumo ilch'i), etc. <85> At times, he specifically visited provincial believers (特히 地方敎徒 巡訪; t'ŭkhi chibang kyodo sunbang), working hard (奔走; punju) to establish the independent faith (自立的 信仰 確立; charipchŏk sin'ang hwangnip) of ordinary believers (一般敎人; ilban kyoin) and foster social solidarity (社會的 團結 是作; sahoejŏk tan'gyŏl sijak). It seemed he was secretly preparing (暗暗히 明日 活動 準備; amamhi myŏng'il hwaltong chunbi) for future activities.
Regarding cultural enterprises (文化事業; munhwa saŏp), he operated schools (學校 經營 行; hakkyo kyŏngyŏng haeng) to the utmost limit (極限; kŭkhan) permitted by church finances (敎會經濟 許; kyohoe kyŏngje hŏ). He conducted purely social education (順延히 社會的 敎育 施行; sunyŏnhi sahoejŏk kyouk sihaeng) without adding any church coloring (下等 敎會的 色彩 不添; hadŭng kyohoejŏk saekch'ae pulch'ŏm). Within the church (敎會內; kyohoe nae), he established numerous training centers (幾多 講習所 設; kida kangsupso sŏl) to provide emergency social education (應急的 社會的 敎育 施行; ŭnggŭpchŏk sahoejŏk kyouk sihaeng) for the children of church members (敎會 子弟; kyohoe chaje). Although this was certainly not satisfactory (勿論 此 滿足 바 아니나; mullon ch'a manjok pa anina), the Teacher did all he could (先生으로서 爲할 바는 盡爲하얏다; Sŏnsaengŭrosŏ wihal panŭn chinwi hayatta).
That three years ago (距今 3年前; kŏgŭm samnyŏnjŏn), on March 1, Kimi year (1919), the Teacher, together with 32 representatives of the Korean people (朝鮮民族代表 共히; Chosŏn minjok taep'yo konghi), declared Korean independence (朝鮮 獨立 宣言; Chosŏn tongnip sŏnŏn) and consequently became imprisoned (仍히 囹圄 身 된 것; inghi yeng'ŏ sin toen kŏt), is common knowledge (一般 共知 바라; ilban kongji para), so there is nothing more to say. In prison (獄中; okchung), the Teacher contracted cerebral softening (腦軟化; noe yŏnhwa) combined with arteriosclerosis (兼 動脉硬化症 得; kyŏm tongmaek kyŏnghwajŭng tŭk). Due to the critical condition (危篤; widok) of his illness, he was released on bail (保釋; posŏk) in October of the year before last, Kyŏngsin (1920). While undergoing treatment (治療 中; ch'iryo chung) at his detached residence (別邸; pyŏltche) outside Tongdaemun Gate, medicine and treatment proved ineffective (藥石 無效; yaksŏk muhyo), and he passed away (棄世; k'ise) at 3 AM on May 19th last. His age at death (享年; hyangnyŏn) was 62.
To supplement the incomplete aspects (不完全 點 補充 뜻; purwanjŏn chŏm poch'ung ttŭt) of this record, the epitaph (墓誌銘; myojimyŏng) for the Teacher, composed (撰 바; ch'an pa) by Ch'ŏndogyo leader Pak Inho, is appended (幷記; pyŏnggi).

Secret Record for the Tomb of the Third Ch'ŏndogyo Leader, Ŭiam Sŏngsa (Holy Teacher)
The Holy Teacher's taboo name (諱; hwi) was Pyŏnghŭi, courtesy name (字; cha) Ŭnggu (應九), surname (姓; sŏng) Son (孫氏), clan origin (貫; kwan) Miryang (密陽). Father's taboo name was Ŭijo (懿祖). Born on the 8th day of the 4th month, Sinyu year (辛酉四月八日誕生于淸州大周里) (1861) in Taeju-ri, Ch'ŏngju. This was truly the 2nd year of P'odŏk (實布德第二年也) (Tonghak promulgation, 1860 being the first). In Im'o year (壬午) (1882), heard the Way (聞道) from the Second Generation Religious Leader (第二世敎祖), Haewŏl Sinsa (海月神師), thereupon greatly awakened (乃大悟) and became a top disciple (爲高足). In Kap'o year (甲午) (1894), receiving the Master's command (承師命), led the believers (率道衆), striving to support the people's rights (力扶民權); repeatedly rose up but repeatedly failed to achieve results (累起而累失績). In Pyŏngsin year (丙申) (1896), Sinsa bestowed the religious name (賜道號) "Ŭiam" (曰義菴). In Chŏngyu year (丁酉) (1897), he then inherited the religious lineage (乃承道統) becoming the Third Generation Religious Leader (爲第三世敎主). In Sinch'uk year (辛丑) (1901), crossed east (東渡) (to Japan), observed the world situation (觀天下大勢); realizing it was impossible without nurturing talent and watching for opportunity (非蓄材相機不可), he thus cultivated young people (乃養成靑年). In Kyemyo year (癸卯) (1903), the Russo-Japanese War began (日露戰役起); the Holy Teacher thought this was the time for East Asian peace (聖師以東洋平和此其時矣), thus supported plotting with Japanese court authorities (遂贊謀日廷當局), but this also came to nothing (而亦無成). In Kapchin year (甲辰) (1904), distressed that Korean politics were daily worsening (痛韓政日非), sent a letter (移書) to Chief State Councilor (議政大臣) Yun Yong-sŏn (尹容善 - same name as earlier), but looking back, it could not be used (而顧不能用). Thereupon, ordered believers to cut their hair (命敎徒斷髮), had Yi Yonggu and others establish an association (使李容九等設會) in the Korean capital (于韓京) to reform oppressive government (革虐政) and thereby extend the people's rights (以張民權). In Ŭlsa year (乙巳) (1905), following the last instructions (遵遺旨) of the First Generation Religious Leader, Suun Taesinsa (第一世敎祖水雲大神師), commanded the religion's name (命敎名) to be "Ch'ŏndogyo" (曰天道) and proclaimed it to the world (布告天下). In Pyŏngo year (丙午) (1906), returned to Korea (歸國), established the Great Constitution (定大憲). Prior to this, Yi Yonggu had disobeyed orders (先是李容九不用命) and greatly erred in the affairs of the time (而大誤時事). The Holy Teacher issued a religious order (聖師發宗令) expelling his faction and fifty-nine others (黜其黨與五十九人), and the Religion and the Association were thus clearly separated (而敎與會廓乎其分離矣). In Musin year (戊申) (1908), conferred the position of Great Way Master (授大道主職) upon Pak Inho (于朴寅浩), authored the *Múche Pŏpkyŏng* (作无體法經). From this time, the Way became higher and virtue more brilliant (自是道益高而德益邵 - 邵 likely 昭 or 劭); also not neglecting leisure (亦不自睱逸), diligently instructed people (眷眷誨人), causing them to have faith and unifying the organization orderly (使信仰而統一規模井井); especially focused on enlightening culture and establishing institutions (尤用心於啓發文化而立機關焉). In Kyŏngsul year (庚戌) (1910), Japan and Korea were finally annexed (日韓遂合倂矣). Ten years later, on March 1st, Kimi year (後十年己未三月一日) (1919), the Holy Teacher, along with 32 national representatives (聖師與民族代表三十二人), declared Korean independence (宣言朝鮮獨立), was arrested and imprisoned (被拘監獄). The following year (翌年), in the 10th month (十月), his illness became critical (疾劇), released on bail (保釋). Finally, on the 19th day of the 5th month, Imsul year (竟以壬戌五月十九日) (1922), returned to the origin (還元), age 62 (春秋六十二). Buried in Ui-dong, Sungin-myŏn, Koyang-gun (葬于高陽郡崇仁面牛耳洞), likely a place where he walked with his staff and shoes (盖杖屨盤施之所也). Wives Lady Kwak (郭氏) and Lady Hong (洪氏). Five daughters married Yi Kwan-yŏng (李寬泳), Chŏng Kwang-jo (鄭廣朝), Pang Chŏng-hwan (方定煥); the rest unmarried (餘未行). <86> Seven grandchildren (male and female) from daughters (外孫男女七人). Alas! (鳴呼) Our Holy Teacher (我聖師) descended in response to Heaven (應天而降), entered the religious gate early (早入宗門), took upon himself the greatness of the universe (以一身自任乎宇宙之大), but that his suffering heart's desires were ultimately unfulfilled (而其苦衷竟未就)—such is fate (則命也). As for his fame spreading over the six continents (若夫名聲洋溢乎六洲) and his Way being manifest for 50,000 years (而其道之顯互乎五萬斯年者)—these are especially the radiance of his abundant virtue (特盛德之光輝耳). How could this humble pupil (小子) dare describe even one ten-thousandth of it (何敢形容其萬一哉)? Respectfully writing the outline thus (謹書大槪如此), placing it in the dark chamber (納之幽室) (tomb) to attest to the unending future (以徵夫無窮云).
63rd year of P'odŏk (布德六十三年) (1922), 5th month, [day blank] (五月 日). Disciple (門人) Pak Inho (朴寅浩) respectfully composed (謹撰).

Postscript
The reporter, today, when the Teacher's mortal remains (法體; pŏpch'e) are still not cold, has attempted to speak respectfully of the Teacher's life. Unfortunately, the reporter did not often meet the Teacher previously and lacks the qualification to speak of the Teacher's true face. While there are many elders (老宿; nosuk) who were with the Teacher from beginning to end, as they are currently in mourning (喪中; sangjung) for the Teacher, it was impossible to inquire about the details. Therefore, I have written this description for now, hoping for correction and completion in the future. Furthermore, regarding the evaluation (論評; nonp'yŏng) of the Teacher's life, it is not something the reporter dares to undertake, so I have not touched upon this point with even a single stroke of the brush, merely briefly recording his experiences (歷事; yŏksa) first. <87>

**Summary**

This article, published shortly after the death of Son Pyŏnghŭi (Ŭiam) in 1922, provides a biographical sketch of the third leader of Ch'ŏndogyo (formerly Tonghak). It traces his life from his humble, illegitimate origins and rebellious youth in Ch'ŏngju to his conversion to Tonghak at age 22. It details his devoted discipleship under Ch'oe Sihyŏng (Haewŏl), his key leadership role alongside Chŏn Pongjun in the 1894 Tonghak Peasant Revolution, his succession as the third leader in 1897, his attempts to navigate the turbulent political situation involving Japan and Russia around 1903-1905 (leading the Chinbohoe, later merging with Ilchinhoe, and subsequent disillusionment and separation), his renaming of the religion to Ch'ŏndogyo, his focus on internal consolidation, spiritual development, and cultural/educational activities after 1906, and finally his role as a primary leader in the 1919 March First Movement, leading to his imprisonment and death from illness contracted there. The article concludes with his epitaph written by his successor, Pak Inho.

From a historical perspective, this article is valuable as a contemporary account written immediately after Son's death, offering insights into how he was perceived by followers ("Giant of the Masses") and the Ch'ŏndogyo establishment. It provides details on his early life, his version of involvement in the 1894 uprising, and critically, sheds light on the controversial period of attempted collaboration with Japan through the Chinbohoe/Ilchinhoe, framing it as an effort for reform and countering Russian influence that ultimately failed due to betrayal by figures like Yi Yonggu. Its account of Son's shift towards internal religious development and cultural work post-1906, culminating in his leadership of the March First Movement, offers a Ch'ŏndogyo-centric narrative of nationalist activity under colonial rule. Historians might find the justification for the Chinbohoe/Ilchinhoe involvement and the specific details surrounding Son's interactions with Japanese figures like Tamura Iyozō particularly interesting, as well as the portrayal of his final years focusing on spiritual and cultural preparation.

民衆의 巨人-孫義菴先生의 一代記
						一記者
感懷 一事
先生이 永眠하엿다 하도다. 소낙비 우수수 나리고 새날의 暗黑이 오히려 東大門 밧 常春園을 包圍한 5月 19日의 午前 3時로써 先生이 永眠하엿다 하도다. 常春園의 新綠의 葉葉이 그대로 淸新하고 鳥聲의 嚶嚶이 그대로 和鳴하거늘 다못 先生의 숨소리 뿐이 호올로 고요하엿스며 先生의 瞳子뿐이 호올로 그믈잇다 하도다.
「내가 죽을 줄로 생각하는가 죽어도 關係가 업겟는가...」하던 그의 말끗 못 맷던 말슴이 이 끌을 쓰는 記者의 귀에도 오히려 잇거늘 嗚呼 이것이 무슨 일인가. 머리를 東으로 도리킬 때에 다못 雲天이 茫漠할 뿐이로다.
先生의 一生을 簡記해볼가 하야 이졔 붓을 들엇다. 그러나 븟을 내리우기에 先하야 感淚로다. 아아 나의 마음이 이러케 感傷되여서 엇더케 이 記錄을 마칠가.

壬戌 5月 25日 先生이 別世한 지 第6日 되는 날에
幼年時代의 先生의 豪放
그는 淸州 一賤吏의 庶子
先生의 名은 秉熙요 父는 懿祖요 母는 崔氏요 義菴은 그 先師되는 崔海月로부터 受한 道號이니 距今 61年＜75＞ 前 辛酉 4月 8日로써 忠北 淸州郡 大周里에서 生하다.
그 父는 淸州의 常民으로 일즉이 吏房의 末職에 在하야 憤鬱不滿의 中에서 一生을 終하엿스며 그 母 崔氏에 關하야는 別로 傳하는 바가 無하나 孫氏家의 庶室된 點로써 推察하면 그 亦 1個 女子로의 多少 特異한 性格을 所有하엿스며 幾多의 複雜한 境遇에 逢着된 事가 有함과 如하다. 先生의 그 特殊한 天稟도 그 兩親에게서 傳受함이 多한 것과 如하다.
先生은 多數의 人이 實見한 바와 如히 狀貌-雄傑하며 氣宇-英邁하야 幼時로부터 그 炯炯한 眼光이 周圍의 人을 驚하얏스나 家系가 변변하지 못하고 그 中에도 庶出이엇슴으로 들어오면 家庭에서부터 그를 賤待하고 나아가면 隣里가 그를 容認치 아니하야 그 天來의 感情은 이로 因하야 더욱 激越하게 되엇스며 幼時에 暫時 漢文을 修學하얏스나 此를 不屑하야 仍히 放棄하고 稍稍 成長함에 밋처는 그 豪放不覇의 性情을 스스로 抑制치 못하야 飮酒, 鬪錢에 그 身을 委하고 是非, 鬪鬨과 歌吟笑呼로써 어언 20의 春光을 度過하엿다. 當時의 先生과 더블어 追逐하던 故舊의 口傳에 依하면 先生의 20歲 前後의 生活은 그와 가티 放浪하엿스나 放浪한 그 中에서도 可히 犯치 못할 무엇이 잇는 듯하야 酒를 飮하면 酒로 勝하고 雜技를 行하면 技計로 勝하며 肉戰을 決하면 膂力과 氣魄으로 勝하엿스며 뿐 아니라 酒席에 在하면 酒朋을 制하고 雜技板에 立하면 乾達을 制하야써 그 勝하고 制하는 두 가지의 特點은 先生의 當한 大小 境遇를 通하야 觸處에서 볼 수 잇섯다 한다. 이제 그때에 남겨 노흔 逸事의 數者를 選記하야써 當時의 先生의 心情과 行事의 輪廓을 보이고저 한다.

先生이 12歲 되던 壬申에 그 家兄이 先生으로 하여금 葉錢 40兩을 負하야 官廳에 納케 하엿더니 先生이 送中에서 人이 凍하야 死境에 幾至함을 보고 곳 그를 스스로 負하고 酒店에 至하야 溫室에 臥케 하고 因이 所持의 錢財를 給하야 主人으로 하여금 治療케한 바 家中이 그 義救의 念이 强한 것을 驚하엿다 하며.
17歲 되던 丁丑에 先生이 槐山郡 三街里에 至하엿더니 時에 修信使- 至할 새 馬後에 驛人을 懸하야 流血이 淋漓하거늘 先生이 叱하되 人이 人을 虐待함이 어찌 如是하뇨 하고 곳 木棒으로 馬僕을 擊하야 그 懸을 解하게＜76＞ 하고 修信使의 諭書桶을 奪하야 池中에 投하엿다 하며.
또 이 해에 先生이 다시 隣邑을 通過할 새 洞人이 匝坐喧鬧 하거늘 先生이 그 言을 聞한 즉 그 洞里의 某 人家에 家口 5名이 有하던 바 傳染病으로 因하야 全口가 沒死하야 5, 6日을 過하되 洞人이 懼하야 오히려 收拾치 못하고 此의 善後策을 論議한다 하는지라 先生이 慨嘆하되 人이 人의 死를 不救하면 誰가 救하리요 하고 親히 5人의 死體를 歛襲한 後 洞里의 人과 가티 埋葬하엿다 합니다.

心機 一轉의 先生의 新生
22歲에 始로 東學에 入하다
20歲 前後의 當時는 先生의 一生에 잇서 甚히 危險한 期이엇다. 그가 一種의 志를 得하지 못한 逸民이 되어 酣嬉淋漓의 悲態로써 一生을 終할가 그러치 아니하면 背에 萬里鏡을 負하고 手에 不平의 刀를 執하야 城을 掠하고 富를 奪하는 一黨의 豪賊이 될가 또 그러치도 아니하면 이것저것을 다 모르는 한낫의 村中 悖子가 되어 一生을 與草木同腐하는 者가 될가. 이와 가튼 몃가지의 臆測은 當時의 父老가 當時의 先生을 秤量한 바이엇슬 것이다. 果然 20歲 前後의 當時에는 先生으로도 氣가 塞하엿슬 것이다. 志는 大하나 布施할 道가 업고 勇은 壯하나 發揮할 機會가 업스며 貪官汚吏의 橫行, 社會傳統의 醜惡, 보면 눈이 거슬리고 생각하면 氣가 逆하나 敢히 如何히 할 수가 업섯다. 先生의 氣는 鬱하엿슬 것이며 心은 亂하엿슬 것이다. 그런데 一途의 新生의 曙光은 先生의 身上을 向하얏다.
22歲 되던 때이라. 東學의 信者 某가 先生의 入道를 勸하얏다. 三災八亂을 免한다는 勸說과 가튼 것은 先生의 意志를 動하기에는 넘우 淺薄하얏스나 輔國安民, 廣濟蒼生의 實理가 그 間에 包容되엇다는 說法은 甚히 先生의 心情을 感動케 하얏다. 이에 先生은 斷乎한 決心으로써 곳 道에 入하엿다. 이로 先生의 心氣는 一轉하엿스며 先生의 生活은 一新하엿다. 從來의 疎放한 生活은 自己의 心性을 過誤케 함이 多大한 것을 黙認하엿스며 大事의 成就는 먼저 그 일을 經營하는 主人公의 健全한 性格으로부터 生産되는 것을 心證하엿다. 先生은 이에 門을＜77＞ 廢하고 席에 跪하야 東學의 修道 節次에 依하야 守心正氣에 全力하엿다. 이때의 先生이 그 心性을 修練하기에 얼마나 열심한 것은 當時의 傳道人으로부터 東學先生 崔海月이 近地에 來함을 聞하고 先生으르 하여금 拜謁의 例를 行하게 하고저 할 때에 「余- 踈放한 心을 改한 後가 아니면 先生을 拜見할 수가 업다」한 한 가지의 事實로써 可히 豫測할 수 잇다.
24年 甲申에 先生이 처음으로 東學의 第2歲 敎主 崔海月의 門下에 拜謁한 後 師弟의 義를 重盟하고 崔先生의 指導에 一從하야 德業을 大成하기로 할 새 是로부터는 崔先生의 側을 不離하고 休戚을 共히 하되 出入할 때에는 先生의 乘轎를 擔하고 止宿할 때에는 先生의 門戶를 守하야 始終이 如一하얏스며.
30歲 되든 庚寅에는 先生이 鎭川郡에 居하며 修道의 節을 定하고 21日을 1期로 하야 呪文 (侍天主造化定永世不忘萬事知) 百萬讀을 誦할 새 不臥不寐하고 訖工하니 是年에 如是하기 凡 3次이엇스며 每日 2雙의 屨를 捆하기로써 日課를 삼아 一定 不易하니 時人이 稱하야 孫學者라 하얏다.
要컨대 先生이 22歲에 東學에 入하야 34歲 되던 癸巳에 至하기까지 凡 13年의 間은 먼저 心을 養하고 性을 修하야 20歲 前後의 放浪生活로부터 誘致된 傷處를 補하기에 努力하얏스며 나아가 自己의 所信을 周圍의 만흔 多衆에게 傳하야 不少한 徒弟를 得하는 同時에 特히 先生의 天稟의 卓越과 身心의 精篤은 其師 崔海月의 信任을 得한 바 되어 東學의 明日 指導者가 될 起草가 그간에 지여짐과 가튼 것은 이때에 잇서 特技할만한 事이라 하겟다. 이제 其間에 지내온 先生의 行蹟을 두어가지의 逸事로써 代言하리라.

29歲 時의 事이다. 이때에 東學에 對한 指目이 日甚하는 中 東學의 頭目으르 또 先生의 從姪되는 孫天民이 또한 指目을 被하야 其家에 不入하더니 校卒이 其妻를 捕하거늘 이때 先生이 마츰 在傍하다가 勃然厲聲 曰 其妻를 捉함이 其叔을 捕함과 如何한고 余는 天民의 叔이로라 한대 校卒이 仍히 先生을 捕하거늘 先生이 淸州郡 酒城店에 至하야는 酒八盃를 連飮하고 曰 余- 大醉하야 步行치 못할지니 爾等은 我를 負去하라 하고 坐而不動하니 校卒이 할 수 업시 先生을 負하야 淸州 鎭營에 捉致하야 考招할 새 崔海月의 所在를 問한 즉 曰 余- 旣自現하야＜78＞ 死生을 決한 以上, 更히 先生의 所在를 吐說할 理가 有하리요 하고 正色不動한 바 營將이 그 義風에 感하야  곳 放釋하엿다.
32歲 時의 事이다. 先生이 作客 中 日이 暮하야 어떤 酒店에 止하니 店主는 一女子 뿐이오 其夫는 出他하엿더라. 夜深에 店女- 酒를 進하거늘 先生이 曰 余- 旣히 斷飮하엿노라. 또 烟草를 進하거늘 余- 旣히 斷吸하엿노라. 다시 艶麗로써 誘하거늘 余- 旣히 斷慾하엿노라 한대. 店女- 失色 曰 어찌 如斯히 甚하니이까. 先生이 曰 余- 平生의 經營이 有하야 篤心戒持한지 已久하니 酒를 飮하면 是害요 肉을 啖하면 是害요 烟을 吸하면 是害요 女人을 嬖하면 是害라 故로 如是하노라 하엿다 한다. 그 決心의 鞏固- 盖如斯하엿다.
이때의 所謂 兩班者流가 東學의 禁止를 標榜하고 道人의 財産을 强奪하기로 是事할 새 道人 韓榮錫이 錢 3千兩과 牛 1頭를 權用哲에게 掠奪된지라 先生이 곳 權에게 迫至하야 그 不意를 叱하고 그 財와 牛를 還取하야 韓에게 給하니 如是한 事는 자못 其回를 不許하리 만큼 多하엿다 한다.

甲午의 革命과 先生의 奮戰
先生의 胸中에는 오즉 民衆을 爲하는 熱血 밧게 업섯다. 더욱이 當時의 暴政, 劣等의 制度, 怪惡의 慣習은 先生의 心情을 刺戟하엿스며 繼하야 古阜에서 起한 民衆의 一揆는 先生의 義憤을 爆發케 하엿다.
34歲 되던 甲午 10月이라 先生은 東學의 第2歲 敎主 崔海月의 同意를 得하야 古阜, 沃溝, 井邑, 泰仁, 萬頃, 金堤, 金溝, 高敞, 茂長, 務安, 任實, 南原, 淳昌, 茂朱, 扶安, 長興, 潭陽, 昌平, 益山, 長城, 綾州, 光州, 寶城, 羅州, 康津, 海南, 長水, 靈光, 礪山, 高山, 珍山, 錦山, 谷城, 全州, 順天, 廣州, 淸州, 忠州, 安城, 驪州, 楊根, 砥平, 原州, 橫城, 洪川, 瑞山, 德山, 唐津, 泰安, 安眠島, 藍浦, 晋州, 昆陽, 河東, 南海, 丹城, 泗川, 海州, 松禾, 信川, 載寧, 豊川, 長淵, 文化, 安岳 等地의 孫天民, 金演局, 李容九, 朴寅浩, 金開南 외 315頭領의 起包로 成한 百萬의 徒衆을 率하고 먼저 全琫準으로 더블어 公州에 會하야 政界廓淸, 民權擁護의 旗下에서 革命의 矩火를 擧하다. 是에 先하야 東學을 修하는 幾萬의 徒衆은＜79＞ 先師 崔水雲의 無罪就戮을 願하며 貪官汚吏의 亂法橫暴를 憤하야 正義의 火旗를 擧하려 하기 累次이엇스나 其師 崔海月께서 오히려 其機의 未熟을 慮하고 團結의 不鞏을 憂하야 時來風送의 明日을 期하던 中 是에 至하야 始로 時-至하고 衆이 合하야 乾坤一擲의 民衆運動을 起하니 先生은 當時의 全琫準과 相幷하야 此役의 唯一한 指導者이엇스며 單身으로 銃砲의 間에 立한 勇壯한 先鋒이엇섯다. (甲午의 役에 關하야는 本誌의 第22號, 23號에 「甲午의 革新運動」이란 題下에서 그 梗槪가 略述한 것이 有함으로 이에 上述치 아니함).
이때의 民軍은 憤을 激하엿스나 操鍊이 無하고 且 公州의 役은 第1回의 對戰이엇슴으로 何等의 經驗을 不得하야 그만 官軍에게 不利하고 論山으로 退屯하엿다가 先生은 다시 益山, 全州, 金溝, 泰仁, 井邑, 右阜, 長城, 淳昌, 任實 等地를 歷經하야 茂朱에서 李應白의 民堡軍을 大破하고 다시 永同郡 龍山市에 至하야 官軍과 相遇하얏는데 時에 大霧- 滿天하고 官軍이 旣히 數重으로 包圍하야 其勢- 岌嶪하더니 先生이 結社의 道衆을 指揮하야 力戰擊退하얏스나 是役에 流丸이 先生의 周衣를 破裂하야 先生의 運命이 實로 風前의 燈火와 如하엿다.
先生은 이로부터 更히 其軍을 淸州, 忠州 等地로 移하야 且戰 且休하엿스나 歲- 乙未에 入하며 當時의 政府로부터는 兵을 旣히 日本에 借하야 大規模의 剿伐을 行할 새 軍事의 試鍊이 無한 道人軍이 此를 對敵치 못하야 到處에서 崩潰하는 中 먼저 金開南이 全州에서 被殺되고 全琫準이 京城으로 逮捕되며 大勢- 旣 非한지라 先生은 殘餘의 道衆으로 더블어 後日의 捲土重來를 約하고 江原道로 元山에 至하야 所持의 眼鏡 1個를 賣하야 糧米와 衣服을 準備하고 山間의 行商을 假粧하야 其身을 中國地方에 暫避하다. (乙未 6月의 事).
其後 丙申에 入하며 官軍의 出沒이 止하고 南路가 始通하는지라 先生은 이에 其師 崔海月의 指導에 依하야 各地의 道人에 對한 收拾을 專務할 새 怪惡한 指目과 險亂한 砲雨의 中에서 能히 誠實하며 能히 奮鬪하야 到處에 實績을 收한 바 其師 崔海月이 特히 先生의 信義를 贊하야 「孫某의 信義는 天下에 無雙」이라 하고 내히 義菴 道號를 賜하엿스며 翌年 丁酉에는 更히 海月 先生의 道統을 受하야 東學의 제3세 교주가 되니 此時 선생의 년은 37세이엇다.＜80＞
34歲의 時로부터 41歲에 至하기까지의 凡 8年間의 先生은 甲午革命의 促成 及 此의 收拾으로써 奔走하얏다. 事의 結局 失敗는 是運이며 勢이라 말할 것이 업거니와 如何間 先生으로는 그 爲할 바를 盡爲하엿다. 이제 그間에 나타난 逸事의 數件을 記하야써 記錄의 杜撰을 補하리라.

甲午의 役中, 公州로부터 論山에 退屯한 時의 事이다. 1日은 論山에 屯한 諸 道人이 相鬧 曰, 諸 頭領은 造化도 업시 衆人으로 하여금 亂에 陷케하니 此를 先殺함만 不如하다 하야 其勢- 猖獗하거늘 先生이 문득 半月山에 登하야 軍衆에게 告하야 曰 『爾等이 萬若 造化를 不信하거든 一齊히 我를 射하라』하야 衆人이 皆 俯伏하엿다 한다. (註, 當時의 道衆의 多數는 頭目의 造化 뿐을 信하엿다)
乙未年의 事이다. 先生이 海月을 陪하고 麟蹄郡 崔永瑞家에 在하얏는데 永瑞- 家貧하야 多數의 人을 供饋키 難한지라 先生이 이에 其弟 秉欽으로 더블어 商人을 假裝하야 杆城郡 鴨津里 李某의 客店에 至하얏는데 囊中에 1錢의 所持가 無하얏다. 時에 適히 該鄰에 居하는 尹圭七이라는 人이 先生의 儀表에 感하야 直히 千金으로써 施惠하기를 自請하고 天兩의 票를 出하야 元山 客主에서 此를 推尋케 하거늘 先生이 固辭한즉 尹씨- 亦 不聽하고 그대로 歸家한지라 此時에 秉欽이 曰 吾儕가 尹君과 平素의 親誼가 無하거늘 그가 如此히 厚愛함은 是- 實로 天意에서 出함이라 受하야써 神師(崔海月)에게 供함이 여하할가 한즉 先生이 不可하다하야 曰 吾輩- 朝鮮의 民衆을 水火中에 求하고저 하다가 反히 數十萬의 良民으로 하여금 砲火와 劒頭의 魂이 되게 하엿스니 吾輩- 비록 風餐露宿할지라도 可히써 苟且히 安身키를 圖謀치 못할지라 余- 어찌 此金을 受하리요 하고 是夜에 書를 修하야 錢票를 其主에게 送하고 單身으로 元山으로 向하엿다 한다.
이 또한 亂中의 事이다. 先生이 論山으로부터 靑山을 通過할 새 從者- 告 曰 先生의 家族이 此地에 在하니 暫時 入見함이 如何하니이까 한대 先生이 曰 누가 家族에 對한 愛情이 無하리요. 그러나 이제 衆人의 家族이 亂中에 散在하야 生死를 不知하거니 余- 어찌 獨히 妻子를 私見하리요 하고 過門不入하엿다 한다.＜81＞

癸卯의 失敗와 甲辰의 更張
甲午의 運動에 見敗한 先生은 그 後에 곳 道衆의 收拾에 專力하야 捲土重來의 明日을 期하엿스나 그리할 딴 機會는 容易히 오지 아니하엿다. 뿐아니라 一自經亂 以後의 地方官廳은 東學의 徒를 加一層 嫉視 또는 輕視하야 虐待가 日苛할 새 東學의 2世 敎主 崔海月은 戊戌의 夏에 京城에서 處絞되고 餘虐이 猶甚하매 先生은 當分間 國內에서 有爲치 못함을 知하엿슬 뿐 아니라 歐米의 文明風潮가 東方에 流入되며 東洋의 局面이 將次 一新一變할 것을 察하고 먼저 自己로부터 한번 天下를 遊歷하야 近代文明의 性質과 世界 大勢의 如何를 直接으로 推察한 然後에 다시 機를 乘하야 事를 擧하리라 하고 道中의 大小事는 本國의 諸頭目에게 一任한 後 李祥憲으로 變名하야 먼저 米國을 向하고저 日本의 長崎로 向하니 時는 辛丑 3月이엿다.
그러나 旅費의 不足으로 此를 不果하고 暫時 日本에 滯留할 새 朝廷에서 勅令으로 召致할 形便이 有한지라 更히 身을 上海로 隱하니 朝鮮의 國事犯 朴泳孝, 權東鎭, 趙羲淵, 李軫鎬 等과 其文을 通하기는 盖 此時 (滯日時)의 事이엿다.
先驅者의 席이 어찌 暖할 수 잇스며 風雲兒의 突이 어 黔할 수 잇스리오. 가지가지로 하야 坐不安席의 先生은 是歲 10月에 更히 元山港으로 還國하얏다가 越明年 壬寅에 書生 24人과 同伴하야 日本에 至하야 그들을 各各 就學케한 後 隱隱히 東洋의 風雲을 鑑察하며 本國의 敎徒를 團束하얏다.
時는 癸卯 夏(明治 36年)이라 當時의 朝鮮政府에는 守舊便이요 또 親露黨인 李允用一派가 用事하야 國政이 日非하고 日本上下에서는 露國의 極東 侵略을 是憂是憤하야 對露國宣戰을 準備함과 如한 바 實로 東亞多事의 秋이라 先生이 自思하되 日露의 衝突은 大勢의 所不免이오 衝突한다하면 東亞의 將來를 爲하야 日本이 其勝을 不得하면 不可할지라 그러나 日本이 得勝한다 하야 반듯이 朝鮮 自體의 利益이 될 것이 아닌즉 此際에 其機를 先制하되 먼저 日本과 協力하야 露國을 排除하고 日本과 約同等의 餘威로써 朝鮮의 萬般을 維新하고 進하야 東西의 局面을 定하리라 하고 先生은 此를 權東鎭, 趙羲淵과 議하엿스며 權, 趙 兩人은 此意를 當時 日本의＜82＞ 參謀總長 田村怡與助에게 通하얏스며 田村은 곳 關係當局의 內認을 得하야 先生과 相會하야 前後의 大計를 暗定하니 其計의 要는 大槪 如下하엿다.
即 먼저 日本兵士로 하여금 商人으로 變裝하야 秘密히 不通商港에 入하엿다가 東學의 道衆과 더블어 齊聲並起하야 直히 京城을 衝擊하야 當時 政府의 露黨을 除하고 除한 後는 一面으로 內政을 革新하고 一面으로 大軍을 出하야 日本과 共히 露國을 擊退하자 함이엇다. 此時의 日本側으로부터도 萬一 此와 如히 朝鮮과 其力을 合하야써 露를 除하면 戰後의 利功이 自己에게 偏歸치 못할 것을 念慮치 아니함도 아니엇슬지나 當時의 情形은 日本에서 露國의 富强을 甚히 畏懼한 同時에 戰勝을 必期치 못하얏스며 더욱 此間에 朝鮮 全國의 日本에 對한 向背의 如하는 自己의 結局 運命을 決하는 最後가 됨으로 그들은 戰後의 利益을 專有치 못할 것을 覺悟하엿슴에 不拘하고 朝鮮의 人과 더블어 手를 握코저 함이엇다.
如斯히 大謀를 確定한 先生은 其弟 秉欽을 本國에 委遣하야 如此如此히 할 策을 授하고 全國의 道儒에게 其意를 傳하야 一擧에 奮應할 準備를 先行하게하다.
嗚呼라 朝鮮의 無福인가 抑先生의 無福인가. 是歲의 8月 3日에 右謀의 主腦者이며 또 實行者인, 孫秉欽이 急疾로써 釜山에서 沒하고 同 5日에 田村이 又 沒하야 吊電이 一時에 並至하니 先生이 放聲慟哭하고 3日을 不食하엿다. 그러나 先生은 此로써 沮喪치 아니하고 但 曰 事正理順하면 반듯이 成할 日이 有할지요 비록 成치 못한다 할지라도 余는 最後까지 努力할 뿐이라 하고 更히 厲志續行할 새 翌年 甲辰에 李仁淑으로 하여금 書를 本國의 諸 頭目에 傳하야 그윽히 民會를 組織케하며 一面으로 長書를 當時의 政府大臣 李容憲에게 至하야 秕政을 彈劾하고 同年 4月에 門徒 朴寅浩, 洪秉箕를 日本으로 請하야 다시 大意를 擧할 準備로써 먼저 地方道人의 一齊 斷髮할 旨를 命하고 更히 權東鎭, 吳世昌, 趙羲淵 등으로 더블어 道人會集의 計를 議定할 새 會名을 進步會 (一國의 민으로 하야 步步齊進하야 文明의 域에 共躋하자는 意)라 하고 그의 趣旨와 綱領과 規則을 製하야 李容九, 朴寅浩, 洪秉箕, 羅龍煥, 李鍾勳, 朴衡采, 鞠吉賢 等으로 하여금 其事를 主케 하고 同年 秋 9월에 全國을 通하야써 開會하니 是에 先하야 地方道人으로서 一齊히 其髮을 斷하야 死로써 自誓한 者- 實로 16萬의＜83＞ 多數에 至하엿스며 時 或 地方의 形便如何에 依하야는 砲火의 威脅한 바- 되엇스나 少毫도 不屈하고 다- 無難히 그 目的을 達하얏더라.
是時에 進步會- 更히 4綱領으로 世에 佈明하며 一層 그 活動을 盛히 하며 同 11月에 進步會- 更히 一進會(是에 先하야 宋秉畯, 尹始炳 一派의 政客으로 成한 者)와 合勢하니 其勢- 益張하엿다.
補記 當時 進步會의 4綱領이라 함은 1. 獨立의 基礎를 鞏固케 함이오 2. 政府를 改繕함      이오 3. 生命 財産을 保護케 함이오 4. 軍政 財政을 整理함이엇다.
슬프다 한낫의 事業을 成就하기가 어찌면 그러케 힘이 들며 몃명의 사람을 信任하기가 어 찌면 그러케도 어려울가. 그 行事의 是非善惡을 姑舍勿論하고 一進會의 當時 幹部 李容九 以外의 몃 사람은 멀리 日本에서 地圖의 鞭을 執한 先生의 本意를 違背하고 自由의 行動을 就하야 大勢大事는 已非하엿다.
先生은 부득이 最後의 整理策으로 翌年 乙巳 冬에 天道敎의 命으로써 敎會의 分析을 天下에 布告하며 翌年 丙午에 日本으로부터 歸國하야 天道敎 大道主의 職務를 親掌하며 敎會의 面目과 內容을 一新케할 새 敎會의 憲則을 制定하야 京城에는 中央總部, 地方에는 敎區를 置하야 侍日, (基督敎의 禮拜日에 當함) 誠米 (敎會의 根本的 經濟策으로서 敎人이 依名數하야 每食에 米 1匙式을 貯供케 하는 것)의 制를 實行케 하며 다시 一進會의 頭領 李容九, 宋秉畯 等 62人을 黜敎하고 敎務의 擴張에 專力하엿다.

多感한 先生의 晩年
其業이 未半하야 其身이 先死
局面은 急轉하엿다. 一自 庚戌 以後의 先生은 內로 自身의 修煉 及 敎徒의 團束과 外로 文化 事業의 振作에 全力을 傾하얏다. 甲午 以後의 先生, 特히 癸卯 以後의 先生은 極度로 落心도 하얏스며 興奮도 되엇섯다. 淫風의 朝霾雨의 夕에 傷心의 淚를 揮하기도 幾次이엇스며 激忿의 情을 禁하지 못한 적도 幾回이엇슬 것이다. 萬一 그의 平素의 修養과 試煉과 또 天稟이 아니엇더면 到底히 그러한 境遇에 堪支하기조차 어려웟슬 것이다. 생각컨대 先生은＜84＞ 먼저 自己의 心身에 對한 修養의 必要를 感함과 如하며 다시 一般 敎徒의 修養의 必要를 切感함과 如하다. 그래서 그는 곳 大道主의 職을 現 敎主 朴寅浩에게 前章케 하고 주로 精神的 方面의 建設에 全無할 새 戊申 10月에는 梁山 通度寺의 內院菴에 專往하야 49日의 祈禱를 行하고 無軆法經과 後經을 親制하야 敎徒의 靈粮을 準備하며 辛酉에는 現 敎主 朴寅浩 以下 諸部員과 공히 慶州의 聖地에 專往하야 天道敎 第1歲 敎祖 崔水雲 及 第2歲 敎主 崔海月의 舊址를 拜觀하고 後 乙卯에는 105日의 祈禱를 又 行하야 前後 約 10年의 此間에 先生의 德業이 大成하고 心氣가 俱和하엿스니 이제 此間에 成한 詩의 數句와 異事의 一을 記하야 德業의 大成을 証하리라.

梁山 通度寺의 工을 訖한 後에 吟한 詩에 曰
道過三天心自昏, 風動細波空作喧. 白雲以上白雲下, 上以也聽下以論.
又曰
遍踏法界故家歸, 五色花葉簷外飛. 淸虛月色澹泊味, 空使主翁自足肥.
又曰
世法百年苦, 聖法萬年愁

그리고 甲寅 11월 7일(時年 54)에는 선생이 食床을 受할 새 때에 마츰 문을 개방하엿더니 野雀 100여 首가 飛入하야 선생을 環坐하는지라 선생이 飯으로써 分飼하니 群雀이 혹은 膝에 좌하고 혹은 手에 登하야 飯을 受食하엿스며 그 翌日 早朝에는 山雉 10여 首가 內庭에 飛入하야 2시간頃을 游弋而歸한 바 선생의 和氣가 禽鳥에 及함과 如하얏다.
다시 敎徒에 對한 修養으로는 21日, 49日, 105日 祈禱 等을 時時로 奉行케 하엿스며 特히 地方의 主要 頭目을 會同하야 閒寂한 處를 擇하야 數回의 特別祈禱를 行케 하엿스며 그리고 每歲에 1次式은 地方敎徒의 多數를 集合하야 以身換性說 大神師(崔水雲)性靈出世說, 人文開闢說, 信仰統一, 規模一致 등 幾多의＜85＞ 法說을 演述하며 時로는 特히 地方敎徒를 巡訪하야 一般敎人의 自立的 信仰을 確立하며 社會的 團結을 是作하기에 奔走한 等, 暗暗히 明日의 活動을 準備함과 如하얏다.
文化事業으로는 敎會經濟가 許하는 極限까지 學校의 經營을 行하야 下等의 敎會的 色彩를 不添하고 順延히 社會的 敎育을 施行케 하였스며 敎會內로 幾多의 講習所를 設하야 應急的으로 敎會 子弟의 社會的 敎育을 施行하게 하얏나니 勿論 此로 滿足한 바는 아니나 先生으로서 爲할 바는 盡爲하얏다.
距今 3年前 己未 3月 1日에 先生이 朝鮮民族代表 32人과 共히 朝鮮의 獨立을 宣言하고 仍히 囹圄의 身이 된 것은 一般이 共知하는 바라 更言할 것이 無하고 先生은 獄中에서 腦軟化, 兼 動脉硬化症을 得하야 再昨年 庚申 10月에 病의 危篤으로 保釋되야 東大門 外 別邸에서 治療 中이던 바 藥石이 無效하야 去 5月 19日 午前 3時로써 棄世하니 享年이 62이엇다.
이 記錄의 不完全한 點을 補充하는 뜻으로 天道敎主 朴寅浩씨의 撰한 바 先生의 墓誌銘을 幷記한다.

附言
記者는 只今 先生의 法體가 오히려 식지 아니한 今日에 잇서 삼가 先生의 一生을 말하노라 하엿다. 記者는 不幸히 先時의 先生을 자조 對하지 못하야 先生의 眞面을 말할 資格이 無하며 先生과 자못 始終을 가티한 幾多의 老宿이 無한 바는 아니나 바야흐로 先生의 喪中에 在하야 그의 經緯를 問議할 수도 無함으로 아즉 이러케 記述하야 後日의 訂正 完成을 期하며 더욱이 先生의 一生을 論評하는 點에 至하야는 記者의 敢爲할 바 못 됨으로 此點에는 一筆을 不染하고 爲先 그 歷事를 略記한 것 뿐이다.＜87＞
