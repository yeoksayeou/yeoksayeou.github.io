**Summary**

This news brief reports demographic statistics for Kyŏngsŏng (colonial Seoul) as of April 1, 1922, detailing population increases since late 1921 and providing breakdowns by nationality (Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Other Foreigners). It also gives the total number of blind and mute individuals across Korea (Chosŏn), separately noting the figures for Japanese residents. From a colonial history perspective, the meticulous categorization of the Kyŏngsŏng population by nationality highlights the administrative practices of the Japanese Government-General in distinguishing and tracking different ethnic groups within the capital. The separate count for Japanese individuals with disabilities further underscores the distinct status accorded to Japanese residents compared to the Korean populace.
