漢詩, 哭 孫義菴先生
						偶丁 林圭

一

His Way connects to the waters of Yongdam, His Heart communicates with the Heaven of the Great Ultimate. The Three Tenets are Sincerity, Reverence, and Faith; One Body unites Buddhism, Confucianism, and Daoism/Sŏn.

二

From the humble marshes, he raised a righteous host, To save the people living in misery. After the rain, snow, wind, and frost, Flowers bloom on ten thousand trees in spring.

三

His great name hangs in the universe, His righteous spirit moves mountains and rivers. For a thousand years, the tears of heroes flow, A single song of a patriot.

四

The entire nation of twenty million, Each person offers one stick of incense. May his great spirit not scatter, Forever protecting the Eastern Land (Korea).<68>

**Summary**

This Hanja poem by Im Kyu is an elegy mourning the death of Son Pyŏng-hŭi (Son Ŭi-am), the third leader of Ch'ŏndogyo. It praises his spiritual teachings connecting to Yongdam (birthplace of Ch'ŏndogyo founder Ch'oe Che-u) and encompassing universal principles (Great Ultimate, Buddhism, Confucianism, Daoism/Sŏn). The poem credits him with inspiring righteous action ("righteous host") to alleviate the suffering of the people ("save the people living in misery"), likely referencing the March 1st Movement, and portrays him as a great national hero whose spirit will eternally protect Korea. For historians, this poem is valuable as it reflects the deep reverence for Son Pyŏng-hŭi as a religious leader and national figure shortly after his death, highlighting the intersection of religion and nationalism in colonial Korea, particularly the role of Ch'ŏndogyo in the independence movement. The poem's fervent tone captures the sense of loss and enduring hope among Koreans during this period.
