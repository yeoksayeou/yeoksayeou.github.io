Yearning
						Myŏngsun Yŏsa

Above my head
Limitlessly
High and distant
In fresh indigo hues
Clearly opened
That autumn sky,
My beloved's heart is seen.

On the Taedong River's (大同江)
Lofty
Rise,
My footsteps,
My heart,
As I tread,
The sound of Mat'an's (馬灘) waters
Is like the mood of the road traveled.

A small boat (小舟) with a fishing rod,
Not knowing where to go,
Takes life from the water
Leisurely;
The mountain sightseer (遊山客) in a rickshaw (人力車),
The female merchant (女商人) carrying her wares (商褓),
Look at me with different eyes.

My heart,
My footsteps,
Going against the wind,
Going against the river's flow,
Along the straight-stretched path, <28>
Step by step I set forth,
Like a beloved daughter (愛娘) following the path
In her father's country.

As I walk alone
The path I must go,
The gentle waves
Are like a smile (微笑) of comfort (安慰);
The solemn cliffs (絶壁),
Bearing wounds (傷處),
Unable to move,
Are like a heart that guards.

Below Pubyŏk Pavilion (浮壁樓),
Waterweeds (水草) the color of decaying leaves (朽葉色),
On silk-like waves (絹波)
Like a mirror,
Draw a pattern (模樣),
Like the hair ends of a beautiful princess (美姬)
Who followed to the water country. <29>

**Summary**

The poem "Yearning" by Myŏngsun Yŏsa expresses a deep sense of longing intertwined with observations of nature and society along the Taedong River. The speaker feels a connection to a beloved ("님") symbolized by the vast autumn sky and walks thoughtfully, contrasting her solitary journey with the activities of others like fishermen, tourists, and merchants. The journey against the wind and current is likened to a daughter following a path in her "father's country," suggesting national sentiment. The poem concludes with images of natural beauty reflecting both comfort and stoic endurance. For historians, the poem offers insight into personal and potentially nationalistic feelings expressed by a Korean woman during the early colonial period (1922). The reference to "father's country" and the imagery of enduring "wounds" (on the cliffs, perhaps metaphorically representing the nation) within a landscape marked by everyday colonial life (rickshaws, merchants) are particularly notable.
