Footprints
						Myŏngsun Yŏsa

In a deep mountain valley
Upon white silk gauze (綾羅)
A single set of footprints
Which noble lady's (貴姬)
Footprints, heading where?

Softly, softly sinking
Step by step, going along
Then seeming to slide straight down.
Footprints upon the virgin snow path
So exquisite, as if pressed onto a board (板).
So exquisite, as if pressed onto a board (板)

Withered leaves of winter trees
Rustle, rustle, clearly imprinted.
Upon white silk gauze (綾羅)
A single set of footprints
Which noble lady's (貴姬)
Footprints, heading where?
Withered leaves of winter trees
Rustle, rustle, clearly imprinted.＜30＞

**Summary**

This short poem describes a lone set of footprints found in the snow of a deep mountain valley. The speaker marvels at their clarity and delicacy, comparing the snow to white silk and the prints to impressions on a board. They repeatedly wonder about the identity of the person who made them, suggesting it might be a noble lady (貴姬), and question where she might have gone. The poem captures a sense of mystery, solitude, and fragile beauty in a winter landscape. From a historical perspective, the publication of a poem by a female author ("Yŏsa") in a prominent nationalist magazine like *Kaebyŏk* (개벽) in 1922 is significant, reflecting evolving roles for women and the cultural landscape of colonial Korea. The imagery of a solitary figure navigating a remote landscape could potentially be interpreted by historians as subtly reflecting the isolation or uncertain paths faced by Koreans during that period.
