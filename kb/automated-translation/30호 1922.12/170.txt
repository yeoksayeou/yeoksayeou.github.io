漢詩
						澹翁遺稿
Master Tamong Yi Myŏn-yŏng (澹翁 李冕榮) was a renowned literary talent (文宰) during the reign of King Kojong (高宗朝). He early resigned from prestigious posts and returned to his hometown in Kapyŏng (加平鄕里), making it his life's work in his later years to encourage agriculture (農) and promote learning (學). There was almost no one in the entire village who had not directly or indirectly received his benevolent influence (恩功). This reporter also received his profound (不淺) teachings, engraving the Master's words in my heart whenever I heard them, and recording his poems in my notes (簡) whenever I saw them. My sincere admiration (誠意) for the Master was second to none. This autumn, on a trip to his hometown (鄕行), I saw the deserted loneliness (門前冷落) of his former residence (故宅) and could not help but feel a sense of past days. Thus, I introduce several of the Master's lyrical and descriptive poems (叙情咏物), along with this reporter's own reflections.

Rush Mat (蒲席)
Soft green rush stems interwoven with rice straw,
Woven into seven feet, accompanying a wooden bed.
Slightly long, sufficiently allows stretching tired legs,
Not cold, convenient for placing an old frame.
Swineherds and cow doctors yield seats to each other,
A scorpion's palace, a flea's room – a good arrangement.
Red felt carpets, embroidered rugs – known only by name,
Beyond my station, how could this mountain home yearn for them?

Wooden Pillow (木枕)
Horn-adorned is too extravagant, earthen spirit is poor,
To support a disheveled head, suited to be carved from pine.
Within this lies a secret treasure, hard to pass down the ages,
Even before Emperor Fu Xi (羲皇), there were people who slept.
White hair and blue mountains are an idle fellow's things,
Black sweet wine and yellow gruel are good village neighbors.
Mutually needed with a reed mat (荻簟), arriving together,
Comforting me always, I am close with you.

Reflections on Reaching Seventy (七十生朝感吟)
A frail, sickly frame, temples like silk threads,
I did not expect myself to reach my seventieth birthday.
Medicine finds it hard to restore strength and health,
My potential talent (匠材) vainly betrayed the time of a wise ruler (聖明時).
On a difficult path, a white-haired wife stays by my side,
Old possessions, the blue felt rug (靑氈), my son already knows.
Leaving blessings for grandchildren – the old man's tasks are complete,
Only holding green barley (?), my daytime eyes are slow.

Part Two (其二)
A celebratory feast in the main hall, wild vegetables present,
Pitifully, my white hair reflects in the clear wine cup.
The alley of one gourd – my heart always admires that life,
Beginning to carry a staff in the village – my age is thus respected.
Reclining loftily amid clouds and forests, long nursing illness,
Abundantly growing spring grass – we share the blessings together.
Numerous congratulatory guests still cause much disturbance,
Lingering intoxication vainly troubles this farming village's affairs.

Reading Tamong's Poems Alone (獨澹翁詩)
Min Yŏngsun (閔泳純)

Respectfully washing, I hold up and read the Master's poems,
Old feelings arise, both joy and sorrow surge.
Recited on a night of clear wind and white moon,
Composed when flowers smile and birds cry.
Expressing feelings without concealment – this is true emotion,
Describing objects, skillfully shaping – that is the real thing.
The former residence is desolate, no one visits,
Several withered willows hang down, obscuring the gate.<96>

**Summary**

This article from the December 1922 issue of *Gaebyeok* introduces several Hanja (Classical Chinese) poems by the late Joseon scholar-official Yi Myŏn-yŏng (pen name Tamong), who served under King Kojong but retired to the countryside of Kapyŏng. An unnamed reporter expresses deep admiration for Tamong, recalling his teachings and lamenting the desolate state of his former home. The selected poems reflect on simple rural life (a rush mat, a wooden pillow) and the feelings of reaching old age (seventy), emphasizing humility, contentment in poverty, and detachment from worldly honors. A final poem by Min Yŏngsun echoes the admiration for Tamong's honest and skillful poetry and the sadness of his neglected legacy.

For historians of colonial Korea, this piece is interesting as it appears in *Gaebyeok*, a progressive journal, yet focuses on traditional Hanja poetry and celebrates a figure from the recently fallen Joseon dynasty. It highlights a current of cultural preservation and nostalgia for pre-colonial values (simplicity, scholarly retirement, rural life) amidst Japanese rule and modernization efforts. The lament for the neglected state of Tamong's home could be interpreted as a metaphor for the perceived decline or marginalization of traditional Korean culture and heritage during the colonial period.

漢詩
						澹翁遺稿
澹翁 李冕榮선생은 高宗朝 당시에 著名한 文宰로 일즉 영예를 辭하고 加平鄕里에 歸하야 農을 勸하고 學을 勉함으로써 晩年의 業을 삼은지라 一鄕人士가 직접간접으로 그의 恩功을 被치 아니한 者- 殆無하엿는데 記者도 역시 不層의 敎를 受하야 先生의 言을 聞하는대로 心에 銘하고 선생의 詩를 見하는대로 簡에 記하야 선생을 慕仰하던 誠意가 人에 不下하엿더니 今秋 鄕行에 선생 故宅의 門前冷落함을 見고 舊日의 感이 업지 못하야 선생의 시중 叙情咏物 數篇을 소개하는 동시에 기자의 소감을 附하노라.

蒲席
軟綠蒲莖錯稻稭, 織成七尺木床偕. 稍長優可叙痿脚, 不冷便宜置老骸. 猪牧牛醫相讓坐, 蝎宮蚤室好安排. 紅毹繡毾名徒識, 分外山家豈可懷.

木枕
角燦太奢土魂貧, 支蓬頭合斲松身. 箇中秘寶難傳世, 以上羲皇有臥人. 白髮靑山閒漢物, 黑甛黃嬭好鄕隣. 相湏荻簟相隨至, 安我長時與爾親.

七十生朝感吟
羸然病骨鬢如絲, 七十生朝不自期. 有藥難回强健力, 匠材虛負聖明時. 窮途白髮妻相守, 舊物靑氈子已知. 留福遺孫翁事足, 但含葱麥晝眼遲.

其二
讌喜中堂野蔌存, 堪憐白髮照淸樽. 一瓢之巷心常慕, 始杖於鄕齒則尊. 高臥雲林長護病, 漲生春草共沾恩. 紛然賀客還多擾, 殘醉空煩穡事村.

獨澹翁詩
閔泳純

盥薇擎讀先生詩, 舊感悠然喜又悲. 吟罷風淸月白夜, 題來花笑鳥啼時, 叙情無隱眞情是, 咏物善形實物其. 故宅荒凉人不到, 數株衰柳掩門垂＜96＞
