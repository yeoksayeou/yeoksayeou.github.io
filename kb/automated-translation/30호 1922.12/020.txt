The next issue is the New Year issue! What shall we use to embroider even more splendor onto the hearts of our siblings who are leaping about with new joy for the new year? To our comrades who wonder what we shall introduce in red, what we shall indicate meaningfully, and what we shall arrange affectionately to make a gift to be proud of for the new year, please wait with joy. —From the Editorial Office—

**Summary**

This short editorial note announces the upcoming New Year issue of *Kaebyŏk* magazine. It expresses excitement and asks readers to anticipate the special content planned, described metaphorically as embroidering splendor onto their joyful hearts and presenting a proud gift through introductions, guidance, and affectionate arrangements. From a historical perspective, this piece highlights the vibrant cultural activity and nationalist sentiment present even under Japanese colonial rule. Magazines like *Kaebyŏk* played a crucial role in fostering a sense of Korean identity and community, and this announcement, with its affectionate address ("동무여" - comrades/friends) and emphasis on collective joy ("형제의 심정" - siblings' hearts), reflects an effort to connect deeply with its readership during a challenging period.
