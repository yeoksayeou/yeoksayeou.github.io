◁Urgent Company Notice▷/-To Readers in the Incheon Branch Area-

Mr. Cho Ri-hwan (曹利煥), the Incheon Branch Manager, has resigned due to circumstances (事情), and we are currently in the process of selecting (銓衡 中) his successor. In the meantime, all business pertaining to that branch will be handled directly by the Main Office (本社). Until a successor is determined sooner or later (早晩間), please conduct all matters, such as magazine requests (雜誌請求) and advertising commissions (廣告信託), directly with the Main Office, and let us further strengthen our connection as devoted readers (愛讀의 緣).

**Summary**

This is an urgent notice from the main office of *Kaebyŏk* magazine informing readers in the Incheon area that the local branch manager, Cho Ri-hwan, has resigned. While a replacement is being sought, all business previously handled by the Incheon branch, including subscriptions and advertising, should be directed to the main office. The notice encourages readers to maintain their relationship with the magazine during this transition. From a historical perspective, this brief notice illustrates the organizational structure of a prominent Korean publication during the colonial era, including its use of regional branches. It also sheds light on the practical challenges of personnel changes and maintaining business continuity under such circumstances, showing direct engagement between the publisher and its readership.
