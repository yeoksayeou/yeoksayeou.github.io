▣ P'yŏngnam Branch 『Woman』 Reporter Newly Appointed
For the sake of the women's community in the P'yŏngan Namdo area, Miss Pak Yŏngbok has been selected as the 『Woman』 reporter, taking charge of correspondence and other related affairs in that region.

▣ Kaesŏng Branch Reporter Newly Appointed
At the Kaesŏng Branch, following the expansion of branch affairs, Mr. Im Kyeho has been selected as the reporter for said branch.

▣ Company Announcement Correction
In the Company Announcement published in Kaebyŏk Issue No. 29, concerning the name of P'yŏngnam Branch Manager Mr. Yi Ch'oehwan, the character 'Ch'oe' (最) was mistakenly printed as 'Sŏng' (晟), therefore we make this correction.

**Summary**

This company announcement from Kaebyŏk magazine issue 30 (December 1922) details personnel changes in its regional branches. It announces the appointment of Pak Yŏngbok as a dedicated 'Woman' reporter for the P'yŏngnam (P'yŏngan Namdo) region and Im Kyeho as a reporter for the expanding Kaesŏng branch. It also corrects a previous printing error regarding the name of the P'yŏngnam branch manager, Yi Ch'oehwan. For historians, this notice highlights the magazine's organizational structure with regional branches, its attempt to specifically address a female readership through a dedicated female reporter even in the early 1920s, and the mundane but necessary practice of publishing corrections, offering a glimpse into early Korean magazine publishing operations under colonial rule.
