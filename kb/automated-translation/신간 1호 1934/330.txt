China's Aviation Lottery Tickets

China's enthusiasm for air power has shown rapid progress in the last two or three years. Specifically, marking the Manchurian Incident (滿■事■) as a boundary, they are planning a major expansion and renewal worthy of close attention. [illegible] Previously, the number of military aircraft in China was approximately:
Zhang Xueliang [illegible] Heavens: 80+ planes
Beiping: 20+ planes
Central Army: Approx. 50 planes
Guangdong Army: Approx. 30 planes
Other: 20+ planes
Total: 200+ planes

[illegible] Among these, there were quite a few considerably advanced aircraft, but originally, the possession of airplanes by each military faction served more to fulfill the need for dignity towards the populace and as a show of force towards other warlords (軍閥) than for actual use. The number of pilots was less than a quarter of the number of planes owned, and even then, their flying skills were extremely poor (貧弱하기 업는 것이엿섯다).

However, today, after more than three years have passed, the Chinese Air Force has completely renewed its aspect (面目을 一新하고) and has reached the position of the world's seventh-ranking air power. In terms of aircraft numbers, despite having lost over 100 planes due to the Sino-Japanese conflict (日■衝突), they currently possess:
Central Army: [one] hundred eighty planes (■百八十機)
Guangdong Army: One hundred twenty planes
[Unclear Name] Army (■■軍): Forty planes
Other: [One] hundred twenty planes (■百二十機)
Total: Five hundred sixty planes

They possess a large quantity of aircraft, and the number of pilots who have received formal training already exceeds 200. Meanwhile [illegible] scheduled commercial air routes have shown an increase from three [illegible] to seventeen lines (三■에서 一■七線으로의 增加), demonstrating that alongside the fervor for military air power, enthusiasm for aviation is also seeing considerable promotion.

Three-Year Aviation Plan

That China's enthusiasm for aviation has flourished is a matter of the recent two or three years, as mentioned [illegible]. The [Lushan?] Conference (■山會議) last August established a Three-Year Aviation Plan. With expenses of 150 million [Yuan?] (一億五千萬■), aiming to become the world's seventh-ranking air power after the US, [Soviet Union?], UK, Russia, Japan, and Italy, they are boosting morale (意氣를 독구고 잇다) with the intention of completing this plan by the end of 1935, possessing a standing force of 1,500 aircraft and having finished training the necessary personnel to operate them.

—(The intervening five lines are regrettably omitted)—

The vast majority of aircraft purchased by the Central and Guangdong forces are bombers (爆擊機), the number of which already exceeds 120. [Aircraft description unclear: possibly mentioning 700 horsepower (七■馬力) engines, speed of 172 or 272 km/h (時速 ■七二粁), operational radius of 1900 km (行動半經 一九◯◯粁), and types like Curtiss or Fiat? (■■치■·■■트· 伊太利 프■프式■■)]. There are not a few [illegible] excellent [aircraft?], and recently [training intensity?] has been extreme [illegible], reportedly conducting [night?] flight training (■飛行練習) almost every night and dawn.

Furthermore, they are said to be inviting [experts/instructors?] from aviation [schools/circles?] of various countries like the US, Germany, France, and Britain (米獨佛英 等 諸國) as aviation advisors, attempting to achieve their ambition of "Overthrowing Japan" (打倒日本). Setting aside the arguments for and against (曰是曰非) this, let's talk about the recent aviation lottery (航空富籤) as one example of financially strapped China's tormented efforts to raise the enormous sum of 1[50] million Yuan (一億■千萬圓) in three years.

Aviation Lottery (航空富籤)

This was established as a collaboration between the League of Nations' Ludwik Rajchman, considered a strategist for anti-Japanese efforts, and Song Ziwen (宋子文). They had intended to allocate a portion of the US-China Cotton and Wheat Loan for this air force construction cost, but when this was interrupted due to Japan's restraint (制止) and other factors, they studied various methods and finally devised a clever plan with the most certainty, which they began using as one of their main sources of revenue. This is the issuance of the "National Government Aviation Highway Construction Bonds" (國民政府 航空公路 建設券).

The nominal purpose is the construction of air routes, but the objective is the purchase of military aircraft. Issued bimonthly, it began from [month/year unclear] ([illegible]年 ■■부터), and in October, the eighth drawing (開獎 - lottery draw) was<124> set to take place.

"Lottery tickets" (獎券) means 'rich tickets' (富籤), essentially a large-scale 'Manin-gye' (萬人稧 - a type of traditional Korean rotating savings and credit association, used here metaphorically). It's quite a massive 'Manin-gye'. The issuance limit per round is 5 million Yuan (五百萬圓) — the price of one ticket is 10 Yuan (銀元 - silver dollars). Currently, they also issue 1 Yuan split-tickets (分作券) (receiving one-tenth of the prize if won), which enjoy considerable popularity and results. The prize amounts are also quite surprising.

The number of winning tickets per draw is:
First Prize: 1 ticket
Second Prize: 2 tickets
Third Prize: 4 tickets
Fourth Prize: 10 tickets
Fifth Prize: 50 tickets
Sixth Prize: 100 tickets
Seventh Prize: 500 tickets
Matching last two digits of First Prize: 4,999 tickets
Matching last one digit of First Prize: 44,999 tickets
Total: 50,665 tickets

This means about one in ten tickets wins a prize. The prize money is:
First Prize: 50[0,000?] Yuan (五十圓 - Note: This seems very low, likely a typo in the original or transcription error for 500,000)
[Second Prize missing in list]
Third Prize: 50,000 Yuan
Fourth Prize: 10,000 Yuan
Fifth Prize: 2,000 Yuan
Sixth Prize: 500 Yuan
Seventh Prize: 200 Yuan
Matching two digits: 70 Yuan
Matching one digit: 20 Yuan
Total: [1],509,910 Yuan (百五十萬九千九百十圓)

The payout of the prize money is said to be entirely in specie (現銀 - silver), not paper currency. Since there are no repayment conditions (償還條件■ ■슴으로) for these winnings, the government can effortlessly collect over 2.5 million Yuan when results are good, and at least over 1 million Yuan even in bad times. The drawing is held each time in public view ([公衆面■에서]) at the Race Course plaza (競尤場 廣場) in the Shanghai French Concession (上海 佛租界), and even the date is reportedly printed on the lottery ticket face.

In any case (何如間), while this alone might not suffice to expand aviation facilities, purchase aircraft (飛行機 ■入), and increase the necessary personnel, the fact that financially struggling China is going to such lengths and is so enthusiastic about expanding its air force is something that cannot but be considered noteworthy. <125>

**Summary**

This 1934 article reports on China's rapidly expanding air force following the Manchurian Incident. Despite significant aircraft losses in conflict with Japan, China aimed to become the world's 7th largest air power through a three-year plan, targeting 1,500 planes by 1935. Facing financial difficulties and obstacles like Japan's interference with foreign loans (like the US-China Cotton and Wheat Loan involving Song Ziwen and Ludwik Rajchman), China implemented a national "Aviation Lottery" (nominally for air route construction) as a major funding source. The popular bimonthly lottery, held in Shanghai, offered substantial silver prizes and generated significant revenue for military aircraft purchases, reflecting China's determination to build its air power, explicitly mentioning the goal of "Overthrowing Japan." From a Korean colonial history perspective, this article is interesting as it shows a contemporary Korean awareness (published in a Korean magazine) of China's military modernization efforts and its anti-Japanese sentiment. It implicitly contrasts China's national mobilization, despite internal divisions and financial hardship, with Korea's situation under Japanese rule, highlighting a neighboring nation's struggle for strength against the same colonial power.
