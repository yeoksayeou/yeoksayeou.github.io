A History of Five Hundred Years of Factional Strife in Chosŏn
						Mokch'unsanin
Part One: Tracing the Origins of Factions

Before beginning this manuscript, the first thing I must say is this: when reflecting on the origins of factionalism that led to the nation's ruin, our current populace of over twenty million must, on behalf of our ancestors and predecessors of the past 900 years, shed tears of repentance and bow our heads in apology before the spirit of Wang Kŏn T'aejo of the Koryŏ dynasty. He was an unparalleled hero in our recent history who achieved the great task of unifying the Three Han states, recovered the old territories in the northwest, and strove for 26 years through arduous management to spread his august influence widely across the East Asian continent. Unfortunately, his heavenly mandate was limited, and his grand plans were thwarted midway. He then composed his sagely plans as great instructions in his last testament for his descendants, subjects, and people. Why is this? Because Koryŏ T'aejo was truly endowed by Heaven with sagely culture, divine martial prowess, and grand talent and strategy. Amidst the chaotic situation of the late Silla dynasty, when cunning heroes arose like tangled hemp, he not only rescued the populace buried in suffering, allowing them to see the light of day again under his benevolent nurturing, but also, as mentioned before, sought to restore the old territories on the continent and propagate the king's civilizing influence. Clear evidence for this includes not only his extant testamentary injunctions recorded in policy documents but also the fact that he first named the country Koryŏ, adopting the old name of Tongmyŏng. Although he established the royal palace beneath Songak Mountain, where he first arose, he merely called this place Kaeju (開州) and did not bestow titles like Royal Capital (王京) or Imperial Capital (帝都). Instead, he designated P'yŏngyang as the Western Capital (西京) <1> and operated all facilities and management centered around the Western Capital, which speaks to a part of his ambitions for a continental policy. Further concrete proof lies in the situation on the Central Plain (中原, *Chungwŏn*) at the time, which was divided between north and south, with the Khitan (契丹) power in the north being particularly strong. The Khitan were a nation given to rapacity and lacking righteousness, specializing in invasion and slaughter. They seized the lands of Youyan (幽燕) to the south and conquered Parhae (渤海) to the east, striving daily to expand their territory and kill people. This could not but provoke the anger of our Koryŏ T'aejo, who was an embodiment of justice and humanity. One cannot permit another's snoring beside one's own sleeping couch. Thus, T'aejo resolved above all to subdue the Khitan and established all his policies with this goal. Consequently, he needed to shake hands and ally with the representatives of the Han people, such as Later Jin (後晋), Later Han (後漢), and Later Zhou (後周), who were ruling alternately in the Central Plain to the west, in order to strike the Khitan from the rear. He also needed to establish friendly relations with the Wu-Yue (吳越國) kingdom of the Qian (錢氏) family in the south to bolster support for us. Furthermore, he needed to nurture the various tribes like the Malgal (靺鞨) and Jurchen (女眞) to solidify the foundation beneath his feet. Thus, to the Han and Zhou states, which valued the vanity of formality and appearances, he pragmatically knelt, despite possessing strength comparable to theirs, and did not refuse their investitures (at that time, Koryŏ used imperial titles like *chin* (朕) and *cho* (詔) and had its own era names and calendar, being in name and substance a fully independent great nation). With Wu-Yue, which was rich in products and greedy for profit, he established trade relations via sea routes, and friendly relations were exceptional. The northern tribes, charmed by T'aejo's authority and virtue, revered the Koryŏ kingdom as a parental land and served it as their mother country (incidentally, later powers like the Jin (金國) of the Wanyan (完顔氏) clan or the Qing (淸國) of the Aisin Gioro (愛親覺難氏) clan, regardless of their newly risen might, considered themselves kin of the same ancestry and never initiated attacks first; notably, the Jin state expelled the Khitan and returned to us the land north of the Ch'ŏngch'ŏn River (淸川江), territory that had previously been seized by the Khitan). Their sincerity and submission were profound.

Just as Wang Kŏn T'aejo's continental policy was steadily progressing towards success both internally and externally, the sad cloud of his sudden passing descended (*kungŏm yudwa*, 弓儉遺墮 - lit. 'bow and frugal plans left behind', an idiom likely referring to unfinished work), and his bold and far-reaching calculations concluded merely with minor achievements (*cho kye p'ak ap*, 操鷄搏鴨 - lit. 'holding a chicken, striking a duck', possibly meaning limited success). He departed for the next world, leaving his unfulfilled intentions in his Great Instructions (大訓, *Taehun*). However, T'aejo never forgot his grand ambitions for a single day, and they are clearly revealed in his testamentary injunctions. Passages such as "The Western Capital is the foundation of our country; one should tour and reside there during the four mid-seasons," and "Transmitting the state and family line to the legitimate son and legitimate grandson is the usual propriety, but Danzhu (丹朱) was unworthy, so Yao (堯) abdicated to Shun (舜), truly acting with public spirit. If any crown prince is unworthy, give it to his next younger brother; if all younger brothers are unworthy, let one from among the brothers whom the court officials recommend succeed to the great lineage," and "The Khitan are an unprincipled, bestial nation; do not form alliances with them as neighbors. My descendants must sever diplomatic exchanges with them; do not engage in marriage alliances or friendly relations," express this clearly. That is, the nation needs a ruler who is mature and virtuous, so one should not necessarily adhere strictly to the principle of direct legitimate succession; that the Western Capital should be the base; none of these points fail to signify this. If Heaven had granted T'aejo ten more years of life, I dare assert that at the very least, our old territories of Liao and Parhae would have been recovered into our hands. T'aejo was not unaware of the admirable civilization of the Central Plain, but while recognizing the strengths that built such high culture among the Han people, he also did not overlook their flaws and weaknesses, such as inertia, frivolity, <2> emphasis on formalism, lack of trustworthiness, and arrogant self-importance. These flaws and strengths of theirs were exposed whenever opportunity arose. Even a rare hero like Emperor Gaozu of Han (漢高帝), despite being besieged for seven days at Baidengcheng (白登城) and performing the rites of a vassal, kneeling before Modu Chanyu (冒頓單于), offering gold, silk, and beautiful women as bribes just to be pardoned and return alive, nevertheless proclaimed to his subjects, "Barbarians cannot be managed with humaneness (*indao*, 人道)," preoccupied with saving face as the Son of Heaven of a great state. An even more tragicomic farce involved Emperor Zhao Ji (趙佶) of the Song (宋) dynasty and his son Huan (桓) (Emperors Huizong and Qinzong, 徽欽二帝), who became captives of the Jin soldiers. They were bound, forced to kneel in court before Aguda (阿骨打), subjected to all manner of interrogation and accusations, given the demoted titles Duke Hunde (昏德公, 'Dim-Virtue Duke') and Marquis Chonghun (重昏候, 'Doubly-Dim Marquis'), and died in exile in the northern frontiers. Meanwhile, the Jianyan Emperor (建炎皇帝), who had fled south, indulged to the extreme in feasting and debauchery amidst the scenic beauty of West Lake (西湖). While relying on the Koryŏ kingdom to rescue his father and brother, his so-called imperial edict (*choyu*, 詔諭) arrogantly and rudely listed phrases like, "The northern captivity of the Two Sages (二聖) is truly a matter of universal indignation for the world. Your country previously received the grace and favor of the Celestial Court (天朝), so you should especially harbor enmity [towards the Jin], take up arms, and be the vanguard for the King." Among the so-called grace and favors, which truly invite ridicule, besides the gift of the 'Dasheng Yue' (大晟樂, Grand Prosperity Music) from the fatuous ruler of a doomed dynasty, Emperor Ji, there was nothing that could be called preferential treatment. They treated our envoys, who crossed ten thousand leagues of blue waves out of admiration for Chinese culture (*mohwa*, 慕華), with suspicious eyes, like spies, keeping them at a distance. The famous literary giant Su Shi (蘇軾), out of stinginess and miserliness, even submitted a memorial titled 'Memorial Requesting Not to Treat Koryŏ Envoys Favorably' (淸勿優遇高麗使者䟽), leveling all sorts of slander and false accusations. How could T'aejo's discerning eyes not have seen through the frog-in-a-well mentality of the Han people? Therefore, while forcefully advocating for the rejection of the Khitan in his testamentary injunctions, even as he himself accepted investiture from Liang (梁) and Zhou (周), he never desired to act as a vassal of China (*Chungguk*, 中國) or engage in the kind of admiration and subservience (*mohwa sinbok*, 慕華臣服) seen later.

Not only were Koryŏ T'aejo's divine plans and grand ambitions thwarted, but the opposite result occurred: Koryŏ ended up serving as vassals (*sinch'ŏp*, 臣妾) to the very Khitan they intended to expel. Subsequently, it similarly served the neighboring Yuan (元), Ming (明), and Qing (淸) dynasties as a vassal state. The external forms of official attire, cultural artifacts, and various systems and institutions became those of assimilated Chinese (*kwihwa hwain*, 歸化華人). Not only that, but even the spiritual life turned into that of pseudo-Han, pseudo-Tang, pseudo-Song, pseudo-Ming figures. While complacently delighting in being imitation (*saibi*, 사이비), monkey-hatted Little Sinics (*hogwan sohwa'in*, 猴冠小華人), the nation's vitality and the people's fate were utterly diminished and shrunken. Among these, the most significant source of disaster and ruin is the factional struggle that is the subject of this essay. Now, when people speak of Chosŏn's factional strife (*tangjaeng*, 黨爭), everyone thinks of the Four Color political struggles (四色政爭, *Sasaek chŏngjaeng*) of the Yi dynasty (李朝). But in truth, if we trace the origins back to their source, the Four Color factional strife was by no means a unique product or creation of the Yi dynasty. Its essential elements and buds arose far back in the early Koryŏ dynasty, 900 years ago. It grew larger towards the end of Koryŏ, and upon reaching the Yi dynasty, it became fully developed and perfected. Its scope became broader, its severity deepened, and its colors and methods intensified, becoming cruel and brutal. The royal court turned into a battlefield, such that the relationship between ruler and minister disappeared from view. Scholarly lineages (*samun*, 師門) became dens of conflict, failing to preserve the bonds between teacher and student. Thus, people who would hesitate and avoid, or obstruct with contrary arguments, matters concerning the well-being and fortune of the state and people, would, once they fought over complex rituals (*pŏnmun yungnye*, 繁文縟禮) and contended for prestigious official posts (*ch'ŏnghwan yojik*, 淸宦要職), display outlandish demonic ingenuity and bizarre schemes erupting forth, and exhibit Herculean, monstrous strength like that of a Yaksha king (*Yach'a Mawang*, 夜乂魔王). Yet, if you ask their names, they are Confucian scholars (*yurim hakcha*, 儒林學者) who claim direct transmission of the true learning (*chinhak*, 眞學) of Cheng-Zhu (程朱), self-licensed disciples of Confucius and Mencius, and high officials and renowned gentlemen <3> expected to serve the ruler and benefit the people (*ch'igun t'aengmin*, 致君澤民). That they fought like this, disregarding ethical bonds (*ryun'gang*, 倫綱), ignoring the state altars and living beings (*sajik saengnyŏng*, 社稷生靈), fearing neither heaven, earth, spirits, nor gods, and even, in severe cases, disregarding their own lives and deaths, engaging in delusions and disgraceful behavior—unless there was some great desire they hoped for and coveted in the background, it could not have been so. What, then, was their so-called great desire? It was the pursuit of profit through the civil service examinations and official posts (*kwahwan*, 科宦) and the prestigious authority of Neo-Confucian moral philosophy (*tohak*, 道學). In short, contention for fame (*chaengmyŏng*, 爭名) and pursuit of profit (*chungni*, 逐利) caused them to sacrifice their entire lives and energies, reducing the nation and the people to skeletons, making everyone on the world stage of the 20th century cover their noses and step back (*ŏmbi kwaengnip*, 掩鼻却立). Now, the tools of this factional strife, namely the examination system and officialdom (*kwahwan*) and Neo-Confucianism (*tohak*), were actually imported from the Han scholars and Han people (*Hansa Hanjok*, 漢士 漢族) whom Koryŏ T'aejo had adopted a policy of keeping at a distance, during the dynastic era that is the direct descendant of our Koryŏ dynasty. We must first examine this influx, rather than solely censuring that of the Yi dynasty era.

According to Koryŏ T'aejo's Great Instructions, the dynasty often followed the principle of fraternal succession (*hyŏngjong chegŭp*, 兄終弟及) for the throne. Immediately after T'aejo, Crown Prince Hyejong (惠宗) succeeded, and thereafter, Chŏngjong (定宗) and Kwangjong (光宗) both succeeded as Hyejong's younger brothers. In the 7th year of Kwangjong's reign, when Emperor Shizong of Later Zhou (後周世宗) conferred upon the king the title of *Kŏmgyo T'aesa* (檢校太師), he specially dispatched Xue Wenyu (薜文遇), an official holding the post of Director of the Palace Buildings (將作監, *Changjakgam*), as the investiture envoy. Accompanying him as a deputy envoy was a man named Ssang Ki (雙冀), who held the office of Judge of the Court of Judicial Review (*Taeri P'yŏngsa*, 大理評事). Ssang Ki came east with the delegation but fell ill and could not return home with the group, staying behind alone. After recovering from his illness, he had an audience with the King and received the honor of being close to him. The King was deeply impressed by his talent, eloquence, and literary skill, summoning him daily for audiences. His favor grew immensely, eventually leading the King to command him to remain in Koryŏ and serve in office. Ssang Ki, moved by the beauty of our land and the King's generous patronage, resolved to become a naturalized subject. He brought his parents, wife, and family over and subsequently became a favored official of the Koryŏ court. Utilizing the King's trust, where his words were heeded and plans adopted, he first changed the official attire to the Chinese system (*Hwaje*, 華制). He also greatly reformed the official system, adopting Chinese models wholesale from ministries like the Chancellery (*Munha*, 門下) and Secretariat (*Chungsŏ*, 中書) to official titles like Chancellor (*Sijung*, 侍中), Minister (*Sangsŏ*, 尙書), Censor (*Ŏsa*, 御使), and Academician (*Hallim*, 翰林), from rank one to nine. The so-called civil service examination system (*kwagŏjedo*, 科擧制度), which tested candidates on literary composition (*sabu*, 詞賦) and Confucian classics (*myŏnggyŏng*, 明經), was also adopted from the Sui (隨) and Tang (唐) models. Thus, our institutions and laws were suddenly changed into the new attire of a Little China (*So Chunghwa*, 小中華). Consequently, within the Koryŏ court, a faction opposing Ssang Ki's reforms and advocating for preserving national traditions emerged, while simultaneously, a faction of opportunists seeking advancement by following him also arose. On top of this, because Kwangjong was suspicious by nature and prone to trusting slander and delighting in killing, meritorious officials and respected elders naturally distanced themselves. Frivolous talents and petty men were promoted, bolstering the power and influence of this rapidly promoted naturalized official, and the seeds of factionalism and conflict began to sprout. Once the examination system was implemented, the atmosphere among scholars changed completely; they devoted all their energy to ornate literature (*sahwa*, 詞華) and slighted practical learning (*silhak*, 實學). Great masters skilled in composing poetry about wind and moon (*ŭmp'ung yŏngwŏl*, 吟風咏月) emerged one after another, but what benefit did this bring to the nation? On the contrary, it extinguished the vital energy of valuing both filial piety and martial prowess (*hyogyŏm sangmu*, 孝兼尙武) and merely fostered the ills of effeminacy (*munyak*, 文弱). Furthermore, when an examination system is misused by those in power, it is natural that the state's prestigious positions (*myŏnggi*, 名器) become bait for powerful officials to gather factions, and consequently, the quality of officials deteriorates. Also, since prestigious and glamorous posts (*ch'ŏnggwan hwajik*, 淸官華誠) like those in the Jinma Yutang (金馬玉堂, academies) were created, isn't it self-evident that if there are "pure posts" (*ch'ŏnggwan*), <4> there must conversely be "murky posts" (*t'akchik*, 濁職)? No matter how foolish or unworthy a person may be, as long as they have eyes, ears, and internal organs, who would willingly choose the murky over the pure? Therefore, passing the examinations (*tŭnggwa*, 登科) and obtaining a prestigious post (*ch'ŏnggwan*) became the coveted goal for those contending for fame and pursuing profit, making factional strife an inevitable outcome. Then, after the mid-period, with the rise of the Mongols, Koryŏ came to serve the Yuan dynasty, forming marriage alliances generation after generation. At that time, there was no distinction between internal and external affairs, and our people could travel freely to China (*Chungguk*). Our people, whose Sinophilic fever (*aehwa yŏl*, 愛華熱) was already intense beyond measure, reached a point where they practically wished their country's name itself could become Chinese (*Chunghwa*, 中華). They sought to directly import anything and everything, trying to swallow it whole, down to the skin and hair (*p'imo*, 皮毛). Moreover, the teachings of the Song Confucians (*Song Yu*, 宋儒), whose era was relatively recent, earned the admiration of our scholarly world (*sarim*, 士林). From then on, it was Cheng-Zhu first and Cheng-Zhu second, unwilling to advance even a single step beyond their doctrines. This became a great revolution in our people's scholarship, and at the same time, it marked the beginning of an isolationist life in terms of thought. Towards the end of the dynasty, amidst the already severe harms of excessive reverence for Buddhism (*sungbul*, 崇佛), the nefarious monk Sin Ton (辛旽) wielded power, indulged in greed and licentiousness, and eroded the national fortune. As a reaction, the study of Cheng-Zhu's Principle (*sŏngni*, 性理) increasingly dominated the world. P'oŭn sŏnsaeng Chŏng Mong-ju (圃隱先生 鄭夢周), hailed as a true Confucian scholar for the ages, arose and fulfilled the role of the era's leading master, promoting Neo-Confucianism (*rihak*, 理學). His merit in defending the Way and refuting heterodoxy (*wido p'yŏgi*, 衛道闢異), even more than his established lonely integrity and outstanding principles (*ko hwan t'akchŏl*, 孤患卓節), could be said to have greatly benefited public morals and hearts in a certain sense. However, on the other hand, it is also a clear fact that it contributed to factional ills, playing a significant part in the disastrous factionalism of the Yi dynasty. Thus, the great national and ethnic mission, which Koryŏ T'aejo had hoped would expand outwards, was abandoned by our own hands. Starting with the capering of partisans (*tangin*, 黨人), we invited and pushed towards today's vicissitudes (*ch'angsang*, 滄桑). How lamentable! What more can be said? <5>

**Summary**

This article argues that the ruinous factionalism (黨爭, *tangjaeng*) commonly associated with the Chosŏn Dynasty (specifically the Four Color Strife) did not originate then but had its roots deep in the early Koryŏ period, nearly 900 years prior. The author, Mokch'unsanin, contends that Koryŏ's founder, Wang Kŏn T'aejo, envisioned a strong, independent state focused on recovering northern territories and maintaining a cautious distance from China, despite pragmatic diplomacy. However, under King Kwangjong, the adoption of Chinese systems—particularly the civil service examination (科擧, *kwagŏ*) introduced by the naturalized official Ssang Ki (雙冀)—shifted focus towards literary skills and competition for prestigious posts (淸官, *ch'ŏnggwan*). This, combined with the later embrace of Song Neo-Confucianism (性理學, *sŏngnihak*), fostered internal divisions, scholarly arrogance, and a Sinophilic (*mohwa*, 慕華) mentality that prioritized empty formalism over practical strength, ultimately sacrificing Koryŏ's original ambitions and paving the way for centuries of debilitating factional strife that weakened the nation. The article laments this historical trajectory as a self-inflicted abandonment of national destiny.

From the perspective of Korean colonial history, the article is interesting for its attempt to locate the "root cause" of Korea's weakness (leading to colonization) within its own history, specifically blaming the adoption of Chinese models and the resulting internal divisions. This internal critique, while focusing on pre-modern history, implicitly reflects contemporary anxieties about national identity and strength under Japanese rule. The strong critique of Sinocentrism (*mohwa*) and the valorization of Wang Kŏn's independent, expansionist vision could be read as a subtle nationalist assertion, emphasizing a unique Korean path distinct from Chinese influence, perhaps serving as an allegorical critique of assimilation pressures under Japan. Historians might find valuable the way it frames Koryŏ history to explain Chosŏn-era problems and, by extension, the conditions leading to the loss of sovereignty, reflecting common intellectual preoccupations of the 1930s.

						木春山人
第一編 黨源溯論



起稿에 임하야 먼저 一言할 것은 당쟁망국의 유래를 생각할 때에 우리의 현재 2천여 만의 대중은 모름직이 과거 900년간의 조상과 前人들에 替하여 참회의 눈물을 뿌려 三韓統合의 대업을 성취하시고 다시 서북의 舊彊을 수복하야 널니 동아대륙에 蕩蕩한 王澤을 펴고저 26년간을 拮据經營하시다가 불행히 天壽有限하야 宏圖가 중도에 좌절되시매 그 이상의 聖謨를 大謂으로 작성하야 子孫臣民에게 遺詔하시든 우리 近古史上의 不世出의 英主이신 麗朝의 王建太祖 위령 아래에 叩頭請罪할 것이라 하는 것이올시다. 何故하면 麗太祖께옵서는 실로 聖文神武 雄才大畧을 天授하오서 新羅朝末運에 奸雄群起하는 난마같은 시국에 際하야 水氷塗炭中에 뭋인 生民을 拯救하야 雨露化育의 아래에 天日을 다시 보게 할 뿐아니라 前述과 갗이 대륙의 舊疆을 회복하야 王化를 보급케하랴하섯습니다. 이 明證으로는 그 遺訓이 方策에 昭在할 뿐 아니라 먼저 국호를 고려라 하야 東明의 舊稱을 襲用하신 것이라든지 王宮을 비록 肇基發祥하신 松獄山下에 두섯스나 이곳을 開州라 칭할 뿐이오 王京帝都 等의 칭호를 冠치 안으시고 平壤을 西京이라 하야＜1＞ 모든 시설 경영을 西京 중심으로 운행하신 것을 보와도 그 대륙정책의 포부 일단을 말하든 것이올시다. 또 이것을 더욱 구체적으로 입증할 것은 당시 中原의 대륙이 남북으로 난호어 그 중에도 북방에 잇는 契丹의 세력이 일층 강대하얏읍니다. 契丹은 食淫無義하든 나라로 침략과 살벌을 조화하야 남으로 幽燕의 地를 掠取하고 동으로 渤海를 攻滅하야 日夕으로 拓地와 살인에 힘썻습니다. 이것이 정의와 인도의 權化이든 우리 麗太祖의 怒에 觸치 안을 수 업는 일이오. 臥榻의 측에 타인의 鼾息을 방임할 수 업는 것이올시다. 이에 太祖는 무엇보다고 契丹을 退治할 결심 하에 모든 정책을 수립하섯습니다. 그리고 보면 西로는 中州에서 交代稱帝하고 잇는 後晋, 後漢, 後周 등의 漢族代表들과 악수동맹하야 契丹의 배후를 충격케 하고 남방에 잇는 錢氏의 吳越國과도 通好하야 我의 聲援을 壯케 하며 다시 靺鞨, 女眞 등 諸族을 子恤하야 脚下의 根臺를 견고히 할 필요가 생겻습니다. 그리하야 형식과 체면의 허영을 조화하는 漢, 周의 나라에는 그들에게 지내는 실력을 가지고도 權宜로 屈膝하야 그 封爵을 辭치 안코 (그 때 高麗는 稱朕 稱詔하고 年號曆朔을 自有하야 名實이 함께 엄연한 독립대국입니다.) 物産이 富饒하고 利를 탐하는 吳越에는 해운으로써 통상무역의 관계를 매저 和好가 비상하얏읍니다. 그리고 북방의 諸部落은 태조의 威德에 悅服하야 高麗 나라를 부모의 邦이라 하야 조국으로 섬기고 (여담이지만은 후일의 完顔氏의 金國이라든지 愛親覺難氏의 淸國이라든지 그 新興强大의 勢力을 가슴에 不拘하고 同祖兄弟의 國이라 하야 먼저 加兵한 일이 업섯스며 특히 金國은 契丹을 驅逐하고 우리의 淸川江 以北의 地로 일즉이 契丹에게 被陷되엿든 땅을 還付한 일도 잇습니다.) 輪誠과 納欸이 지극하얏습니다.



王建太祖의 대륙정책은 如斯히 外로 內로 着着히 성공의 거롬을 진행하든 半途에 俄然히 弓儉遺墮의 悲雲이 襲來하야 雄邁高遼하신 그 算圖가 겨우 操鷄搏鴨의 功으로 幕을 거두고 未卒하신 心事를 大訓으로 남기시고 저 세상으로 가섯습니다. 그러나 태조의 雄圖는 일일도 이것을 忘懷치 안으사 歷歷히 遺訓에 드러낫습니다. 『西京爲我國之根本, 宜當四仲巡駐』라 하신 것이며 『嫡子嫡孫, 傳國傳家, 雖日常禮, 然丹朱不肖, 堯禪於舜, 實爲公心, 凡元子不肖者, 與其次子, 次子皆不肖者, 與其兄弟之中群下推戴者, 俾承大統』이라 하신 것이며 『契丹, 無道禽獸之國, 不可結爲隣盟, 我子孫, 當絶其交聘, 勿爲婚姻和好』라 하신 것 등이 보다 이것을 表現한 것이니 즉 나라에는 年長有德한 인군이 필요한 것인즉 반듯이 嫡嫡相承의 原則에 의치 안으라는 것이든지 西京을 根臺로 하라는 것이든지 하나도 이것을 의미치 안은 것이 업습니다. 만일 天이 태조에게 十年壽를 더 假與하섯다 하면 少하야도 遼, 渤의 우리 舊疆은 掌中에 수복하얏슬 것을 단언코자 합니다. 태조도 中州의 문명이 갸륵한 것을 欣慕치 안으신 것은 아니나 漢族들의 이런 高級文化를 築造한 長處도 認識하시는 동시에 그들의 惰弱浮虛＜2＞, 重形式, 少信義, 妄自尊大 等의 惡癖缺點잇는 것도 간과치 안으섯습니다. 그들의 이 결점, 강점은 기회잇는 때마다 폭로하얏습니다. 漢高帝같은 稀世의 英豪로도 白登城에서 七日被圍하야 冒頓單于에게 城下長跪의 臣禮를 행하고 金繪美女를 納賂하야 겨우 赦免 生還됨에 불구하고 渠의 臣民에 대하야는 夷狄不可以人道貢之라 하야 大國天子의 面皮掩遮에 급급하얏습니다. 그보다도 비참한 골계는 宋나라의 趙佶과 그 아들 桓이 (徽, 欽二帝) 金兵의 俘虜가 되여 阿骨打에게 面縛庭跪로 모든 詰責과 數罪를 당하고 昏德公과 重昏候라는 貶爵을 받어 塞北流配中에서 死去하얏습니다. 그런데 南渡한 建炎皇帝는 西湖勝地에서 遊宴荒亡의 醜態를 極하고 渠의 父兄의 救出을 高麗나라에 依하면서 소위 詔諭란 것은 『二聖北狩, 實天下之所共憤, 爾國曾受天朝之恩禮, 尤當敵愾執殳, 爲王前驅』 云云의 오만 무례한 문구를 나열한 것입니다. 그 소위 恩禮란 것도 실로 噴飯할 것이 만흔 중에 亡國昏君이든 帝佶이가 『大晟樂』이란 것을 贈與한 外에 무엇하나 優禮란 것이 업고 萬里滄波를 건너 慕華遠赴하는 우리 使臣에게 猜疑의 눈으로 偵探客처럼 疎待하고 유명한 문호이라는 蘇軾는 惜費吝財의 餘에 『淸勿優遇高麗使者䟽』라는 封章을 올녀 모든 讒誣를 행하얏습니다. 이와갗이 井底蛙 비슷한 漢人의 심사를 태조의 炯眼으로 엇지 간파치 안으섯겟습니까. 그럼으로 遺訓 중에는 契丹棄絶을 力說하시면서 또 당신이 梁, 周의 封爵를 밧으면서도 毫도 中國의 藩臣自處와 후일같은 慕華臣服은 바라지 안으섯습니다.



麗祖의 神算雄圖가 좌절될 뿐 아니라 반대의 결과로 驅逐하랴든 契丹에게 臣妾노릇을 하게되고 隣하야 元, 明, 淸 諸朝에 일례로 臣事하며 衣冠文物과 諸般 制度 典章의 외관 형식이 歸化華人이 될 뿐 아니라 정신생활까지가 假漢, 假唐, 假宋, 假明의 인물이 되여 사이비의 猴冠小華人된 것을 沾沾自喜하는 동안에 國脈과 民命은 여지업시 喪縮되엇습니다. 그 중에도 제일 중대한 禍胎와 亡源은 本題 하에 서술하라는 붕당의 투쟁입니다. 그런데 세상에서는 조선의 黨爭이라 하면 누구든지 李朝의 四色政爭을 생각하지만은 실상 그 유래의 원류를 遡考할진대 四色黨爭이란 것이 결코 李朝의 특산과 창작이 아니오. 그 要葉와 맹아는 멀니 900년 전의 麗朝 초기로부터 발생하야 그것이 麗말에 이르러 더욱 커지고 李朝에 니르러서는 완비대성하야 범위는 강범하고 정도가 심각하며 색채와 수단은 强烈, 慘殘化하야 조정이 戰場으로 되매 안중에 군신이 업서젓고 師門이 爭窟이 되매 師生의 誼를 保치 못하얏습니다. 그리하야 국가와 民人의 休戚禍福이 繫左한 일에는 逡巡回避하지 안으면 橫議沮撓하는 사람들이 一次 繁文縟禮를 싸우고 淸宦要職을 다투게 되면 奇想天外의 鬼智奇謀가 湧出하고 夜乂魔王같은 金剛怪力도 발군하얏습니다. 그런데 그네들의 일흠을 무르면 程朱의 眞學을 嫡傳하얏다 하는 自己免許의 孔孟徒弟라 하는 유림학자와 致君澤民을 기대하든＜3＞ 大官名紳들입니다. 그들이 이와 같이 倫綱을 不願하고 社稷生靈도 無視하며 천지귀신을 두려하지안코 심함에는 자신의 사생을 不計하고 망상과 추태를 다하야 싸우든 것은 반듯이 그 裏面에 희망과 覬覦하는 바의 大慾이 업지 안으면 그럿치 안엇슬 것입니다. 그러면 소위 그들의 大慾이란 것은 무엇이엿습니까. 科宦의 營利와 道學의 名威가 그것이엿습니다. 얼는 말하면 爭名과 逐利가 그들의 全生命과 全精力을 희생하게 되고 국가와 민족은 해골이 되여 20세기의 天下環視하는 무대에서 사람사람으로 하야금 掩鼻却立케 한 것이 올시다. 그런데 이 당쟁의 도구되든 科宦과 道學은 실로 우리 麗朝의 근대 直孫되는 왕조시대에 의하야 麗祖께옵서 敬遠主義를 취하든 漢士 漢族으로부터 유입한 것을 먼저 검토할 것이오. 李朝 때의 그것만을 誅責할 것이 아니라 하는 것입니다.



麗太祖의 大訓에 의하야 왕조에서는 君位계승을 만히 兄終弟及主義에 遵行하게되여 태조의 직후에는 太子 惠宗이 嗣位하고 그후의 定宗과 光宗은 모다 惠宗의 아우로 繼立하섯습니다. 그런데 光宗 7年에 後周世宗이 왕에게 檢校太師라는 爵位를 加封할 때에 그 나라 將作監이라는 관인으로 잇는 薜文遇를 冊封사절로 특파하얏는데 副使格으로 大理評事의 벼슬을 하든 雙冀라는 사람이 髓伴 東來하얏다가 병을 얻어 일행과 함게 귀국치 못하고 홀노 체류하얏습니다. 그는 病快後에 王께 배알하야 인접의 榮을 蒙한바 왕은 그의 才辯과 詞翰에 심취하야 날로 召對하고 寵*가 極隆하다가 필경 그에게 高麗나라에 留在從任할 것을 命하섯고 그도 우리의 風土의 美와 王의 厚眷에 감하야 이에 귀화하기로 결의하고 父母와 妻眷을 近來하야 仍히 高麗朝廷의 寵臣이 되엿습니다. 그는 왕의 言聽計從하심을 이용하야 먼저 관리의 의관을 華制로 變改하고 또 관제를 크게 革易하야 門下, 中書 등 官省으로부터 侍中, 尙書, 御使, 翰林 등 職名까지 一에서 九까지 華制를 그대로 사용하얏스며 詞賦와 明經으로 試士하는 소위 과거제도도 隨, 唐의 그것을 取襲하야 우리의 典章法度는 一朝에 小中華의 新服으로 교대하얏습니다. 그리고 본 즉 高麗朝廷에는 雙冀의 개혁에 반대하는 국수보수의 일파가 생기는 동시에 그에게 隨附하야 영달을 圖하랴는 시류영합의 일파가 생기게 되고 그 위에 光宗이 猜疑의 천성으로 信讒喜殺하든 까닭에 勳臣宿德은 자연히 머러지고 경박한 才子小人이 進用되여 이 驟用된 歸化人의 勢威를 助長하게되고 服黨軋轢의 禍患이 배태되기 시작하얏습니다. 科試制가 한번 시행된 뒤로 士子의 風氣가 一變하야 詞華에 전력하고 實學을 輕踐하게 되엿습니다. 吟風咏月에 능한 鴻匠巨擘이 뒤를 니여 배출하얏스나 이것이 국가에 무슨 利가 되겟습니까. 도리혀 孝兼尙武의 元氣가 소멸되고 文弱의 弊를 양성할 뿐입니다. 또 시험제도란 것은 이것을 권력자에 의하야 악용되는 날에는 국가의 名器가 權臣의 聚黨하는 好餌가 되는 것은 물론이오. 따러서 관리의 소질이 低惡하야 젓습니다. 또 金馬玉堂의 淸官華誠이 생겻스니 淸官이 잇스면 그 반면에＜4＞ 濁職이 잇슬것도 자명할 것이 아니오니까. 사람이 아무리 至愚不肖한 자이라도 이목과 오장이 잇는 이상에 누가 淸을 버리고 濁에 취하기를 自甚하릿까. 그런즉 登科와 淸官이 爭名逐利者流의 羡堂하는 목표가 되여 당쟁이 생길 것은 必至의 理勢입니다. 그리다가 중엽이후에는 蒙古의 발흥과 함께 元朝에 服事하게 되여 姻戚의 誼를 世結하니 그때에는 내외의 구별이 업시 우리 사람들의 中國교통이 自由任意가 되엿습니다. 그럿치안어도 愛華熱이 百度이상으로 강렬하든 우리사람은 국명까지도 중화가 되기를 원할 만치 되여 무엇이든지 직수입하야다가 皮毛까지 生呑하랴 하얏습니다. 더욱이 연대가 至近하든 宋儒의 학설은 우리 士林의 경탄을 사서 그로브터는 一도 程朱 二도 程朱로 하야 그의 所說에서 일보도 진출치 안으랴 하얏습니다. 이것이 우리 사람의 학문적 대혁명이 되는 동시에 사상의 쇄국생활도 시초 된 것이올시다. 그리다가 그 말엽에는 그럿치안어도 崇佛의 폐해가 심하든 판에 辛肫妖僧이 弄權貪淫하야 國祚를 剝喪하고 그 反動으로 더욱 程朱性理의 學이 세상을 풍미하는데 命世의 眞儒라 하는 圃隱先生 鄭夢周가 니러나 一世의 宗師로 理學鼓吹의 任을 다하얏습니다. 그의 衛道闢異한 功은 그 수립한 孤患卓節보다도 엇떠한 의미로는 世道人心에 裨益함이 컷다 하겟지만은 또 그 반면에는 黨弊로 助長하야 李朝黨禍의 중요한 부분에 공헌한 것도 명백한 사실입니다. 如斯히 하야 麗태조의 期望하시든 外에 향하야 伸張치 안으면 불가할 국가와 민족적 대사명은 우리의 손으로 스사로 포기하고 당인의 跳梁으로브터 오늘의 滄桑을 招致하고 밀엇습니다. 哀痛奈何 夫後何言히오릿까.＜5＞＜1-5＞
