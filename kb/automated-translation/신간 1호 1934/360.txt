Newspapers and Newspapermen

It is very commendable that various companies are working diligently and continuously on the recent Samnam (三南 - Southern Three Provinces) flood relief efforts. However, the fact that self-promotion and competitive fervor between companies, rather than brotherly love, often become too intense and lead to derailments causes general displeasure.

◯
It is rather embarrassing to reveal the facts now, so I refrain [illegible], but if such disasters occur again in the future, it seems we might need to save the conscience of newspaper executives before saving the disaster victims.

◯
Not long after Miss Kim Chahye (金慈惠) left Sintonga Sa (新東亞社), Mr. Chu Yosŏp (朱요섭) went into exile under [illegible] circumstances. Rumors [illegible] are not our concern, but new tidings report that the couple Ch'oe Sŭngman (崔承萬) and Pak Sŭngho (朴承浩) have joined the company as a "Mandarin Duck reporter" couple in their place. In the past, the couple Yi Kwangsu (李光洙) and Hŏ Yŏngsuk (許英肅) were at that company, and the couple Im Wŏn'gŭn (林元根) and Hŏ Chŏngsuk (許貞琡) were also at that company around that time (standard), so the temporary joining of the Ch'oe couple seems not unprecedented for the company.

◯
There is a rumor that the elder brother of Mr. Sŏl [illegible]sik (薛■植) of Tonga Sa (東亞社) recently [illegible]. Having worked there for over ten years, rising to Acting Editor-in-Chief, and with much newspaper experience, he might well dream the dream of becoming a newspaper president on these long autumn nights.

◯
Mr. Kuk Kiryŏl (鞠琦烈) left Tonga Sa with a retirement payment of two thousand won. Just because his surname is Kuk (鞠), doesn't mean he had an obligation to bow down and exhaust himself (鞠躬盡瘁), serving until death (死而後己) at that company.

◯
Tonga Ilbo (東亞日報) has female reporter Ms. Pak Sŭngho (朴承浩), and Chungang Ilbo (中央日報) has Miss [illegible] Tae Myŏng (■大命), but Chosŏn Ilbo (朝鮮日報) alone still has no female reporters. If they competed using airplanes for flood relief, they could surely afford to hire at least a few female reporters – this is the lamenting voice ([歎■聲]) of that company's bachelor reporters.

◯
At Chosŏn Ilbo, there is Mr. Hong Pyŏkch'o (洪碧初) writing the novel *Im Kkŏkjŏng* (林巨正小說), his son Mr. Hong Kimun (洪起文) is in the Research Department, Mr. Hong Yangmyŏng (洪陽明) is in the Political Department, and Mr. Hong Chongin (洪鍾仁) is in the Social Department – four Hongs (四洪). At Tonga Ilbo, there is Mr. Hong [illegible]min (洪■民). At Chungang Ilbo, Mr. Hong Sŏn[illegible] (洪璿■) and Mr. Hong [illegible]yu (洪■裕) are in the Business Bureau, and Mr. Hong Mokch'un (洪木春) also contributes occasionally. The newspaper world these days can be called the Flood Age of the Hongs (洪氏의 洪水時代) — of course, they are not all related.

◯
Mr. Yŏ Unhyŏng (呂運亨) has the elegant nickname "Sports President" (스포스 社長) and also the [illegible] nickname "Wireless President" (無電社長). The term "Wireless" (無電) doesn't mean he has much research in radio (無線電), but that he has no telephone (電話가 업다) at home. Since he used to be a good runner, perhaps when urgent matters arise, he can run around quickly without needing a phone, causing no hindrance to work, but looking at his treatment, one cannot help feeling it is too neglectful. However, it is said he is building a new residence in Kye-dong (桂洞), so perhaps one shouldn't speak so rashly.

◯
Kyŏngsŏng Ilbo (京城日報) and Maeil Sinbo (每日申報) are on T'aep'yŏng-t'ong (太平通), and Tonga Ilbo is nearby on Kwanghwamun-t'ong (光化門通). Chosŏn Ilbo is also moving near Maeil Sinbo ([illegible]), and its new building seems likely to be completed soon. If only Chungang Ilbo moves to that vicinity now, the place could truly be called Newspaper Street (新聞街). <128>

**Summary**

This short news article from 1934 provides gossip and commentary on the Seoul newspaper industry. It criticizes the excessive competition and self-promotion among newspapers during flood relief efforts, notes personnel changes at various papers (including journalists leaving, joining, and married couples working together), mentions rumors about promotions, discusses the presence (or lack) of female reporters, lists the many journalists surnamed Hong, shares anecdotes about prominent figure Yŏ Unhyŏng (including his lack of a home telephone), and observes the geographical clustering of major newspaper offices in Seoul, potentially forming a "Newspaper Street." For historians, the article offers insights into the competitive dynamics, social milieu, and specific individuals within the Korean press under Japanese colonial rule. Details like the critique of relief efforts, the mention of specific journalists and their affiliations (like Yŏ Unhyŏng, Yi Kwangsu), and the geographical concentration of media outlets provide valuable context for understanding colonial-era Korean society and media landscape.

新聞과 新聞人
이번 三南 水害救濟에 各 社에서 熱心으로 繼續 活動하는 것은 매우 感謝한 일이다 그러나 同胞愛보다도 自家宣傳과 他社와의 競爭熱이 너무 激甚하야 脫線되는 일이 許多한 것은 一般으로 하야금 도로혀 不快를 늣기게 한다.
◯
이제 그 事實을 드러 말하기는 오히려 未安하야 莫■하거니와 今後로 그러한 災害가  잇다고 하면 災害民 救濟보다 新聞社 責任者들의 良心救濟부터 하여야 될 듯.
◯
金慈惠 孃이 新東亞社를 退去한지 未久에 朱요섭氏가 ■■으로 亡命을 하엿다. ■間의 風說은 우리의 相關할바 안이어니와 그들의 代身으로 崔承萬 朴承浩 兩 夫婦가 鴛鴦記者로 入社를 하엿다고 새 消息을 傳한다. 전날에 李光洙 許英肅 兩 夫婦가 그 社에 잇섯고 林元根 許貞琡 兩 夫婦 그(標準)가 한 그 社에 잇섯스니 崔氏 夫婦의 一時 入社는 그 社의 ■例도 안인듯.
◯
東亞社 薛■植氏의 伯兄은 未久에 ■■■■■가 ■■라는 所聞이 잇다 入社 十餘年에 編輯局長 代理지 되야 新聞의 經驗이 만흔 그로는 이 長長秋夜에 一躍 新聞社長의 도 한번 여 볼 일.
◯
鞠琦烈氏는 一金 二千圓也의 退職金을 가지고 東亞社를 나왓다 姓이 鞠氏기로 그 社에서 鞠躬盡瘁, 死而後己할 義務야 업겟지.
◯
東亞日報에는 女記者 朴承浩氏 中央日報에 ■大命 孃이 잇는데 惟獨 朝鮮日報에는 女記者가 아즉 업다. 水害救濟에 飛行機로 競爭하덧 한다면 적어도 女記者 몃 사람은 넉넉히 採用할터인데 이것은 그 社 總角記者의 歎■聲.
◯
朝鮮日報에는 洪碧初氏가 林巨正小說을 쓰고 그의 아들 洪起文 君이 調査部에 잇스며 政治部에 洪陽明 君 社會部에 洪鍾仁 君 等 四洪이 잇고 東亞日報에는 洪■民 君 中央日報에는 營業局에 洪璿■ 洪■裕氏가 잇고  洪木春氏 각금 寄稿를 한다. 요즘의 新聞界는 可謂 洪氏의 洪水時代 —— 勿論 가튼 親族은 안이다
◯
呂運亨氏는 스포스 社長이란 雅號가 잇는 外에 無電社長이란 ■號가  잇다. 無電이란 말은 그가 無線電에 무슨 硏究가 만어서 그럿타는 말이 안이라 집에 電話가 업다는 말이다 競走를 잘하든 분이닛가 무슨 急한 일이 잇슬 에는 電話로 할 ■ 업시 急히 여단인다면 일에 妨害는 업겟지만은 待遇로 보와서 너무 忽待하는 感이 업지 안타. 그러나 桂洞에 舍宅을 新築한다니 그럿케 速斷하야 말할 것은 안인듯.
◯
京城日報 每日申報가 太平通에 잇고 東亞가 그 이웃 光化門通에 잇는데 朝鮮이 한 每申 ■■으로 ■轉을 하야 新築社屋도 近近 完成될 모양이니 이제 中央만 그 近處로 옴긴다면 그곳은 可謂 新聞街. ＜128＞
