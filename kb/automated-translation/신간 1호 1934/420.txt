Sea Breeze, (-Three Folk Songs-)
						P'ain

I like
the sea breeze,
In July and August, the Haedanghwa (海棠花)
bloom, bloom in the wind,

Blooming, they scatter, scatter,
falling by the wharfside,
stopping the hand
of the rowing boatman.

Stopping his hand,
he takes another look
at the young woman sending him off
under the pine tree.

The sea breeze <22>
I like it,
somehow making him look once more
at the boat about to leave.

Mineral Spring

Following the cuckoo,
I went into the mountain valley,
and at the mineral spring site,
a single broken water jar.

Which young woman
was in such a hurry
that she even forgot her water jar
and followed that man?

Hair Ribbon

At the Kuksadang (國帥堂) shrine,
whose young woman
untied her hair ribbon (댕기)
and left it tied there?

Uns<23>peakable
sorrowful circumstances,
there must surely have been
for her to do such a thing.

Was it that her husband
who went to the north
hasn't come back
even after ten years?

Or was it to see,
if only in a dream,
her only son
imprisoned in jail?

Full of heartache,
her face praying
to the mountain spirit (산신령),
having untied her ribbon.

How unfortunate,
those clouds crossing
over Changt'ae pass
are shedding rain. <24>

**Summary**

This work consists of three short poems written in a folk song style. The first, "Sea Breeze," expresses affection for the sea breeze, which carries the scent of Haedanghwa flowers and momentarily halts a boatman, allowing one last glimpse of a loved one. The second, "Mineral Spring," finds a broken water jar, hinting at a woman's hurried, perhaps illicit, departure with a man. The third, "Hair Ribbon," depicts the deep sorrow of a woman who leaves her hair ribbon at a shrine, presumably praying desperately for her absent husband or imprisoned son. The poems capture poignant moments of longing, loss, and hardship within a rural Korean setting, imbued with folk beliefs. For historians, the poems offer a glimpse into the personal sorrows and traditional spiritual practices (like appealing to mountain spirits at shrines) of ordinary Koreans during the colonial period, reflecting enduring human emotions against a backdrop of potential social distress, though without direct political commentary.

바다바람, (-民謠三題-)
						파인
바다 바람이
나는 조테,
七八月 海棠花
바람에 피어 피어,

피어서 날려 날려
선창까에 떠러저
노젓는 배ㅅ사공의
손길 멈추니

손길을 멈처노코
한번 더 보데나
소나무 아래선
보내는 각씨를

바다 바람이＜22＞
나는 조테
아모래도 떠날 배나
한번 더 보게 하니.

약수터

법국새 따라
산골로 가니
약수 물터에
깨어진 동이 하나

어느 각씨
급하기도 하여
물동이 조차 잇고
그 사내 따라갓나.

댕기

國帥堂에
뉘집 각씨
댕기 풀어
매고 갓노

말 못하올＜23＞
서른 사정
분명잇서
그랫스련만.

북방에 간
지아비가
십년나도
안오든가

옥에 가친
외아들을
꿈에나마
보렴인가

안타까워
산신령에
당기 풀어
비는 얼골이,

얄구짓다
장태넘든
저 구름이
비 뿌린다.＜24＞
＜22-24＞
