Author: 주요한
Article Type: 시 (Poem)

In the water, it would be a dragon (龍);
On land, it is but a worm.
If the ambition to cover heaven and open the earth (席天闢地) cannot be achieved,
Rather,
In blue waters and clear streams (碧水淸溪),
I shall become an idle body.

Flesh carved from white jade (白玉),
Eyes split from crystal (水晶),
A figure beautiful as if painted—
Once offered to my lord,
How could I ever again
Be held in another’s embrace? <20>

A great man born into the world,
Setting his heart on affairs of state (國事),
How could he refuse even a mountain of swords and a rain of bullets (劍山彈雨)?
But the general's star (將星)
Falls without glory,
Making the world one layer darker.

Bamboo, struck by the wind,
Stands straight and firm, unbending;
Pine needles touched by snow
Grow greener still.
How is it then
That in a single morning,
My once-black hair has turned white?
-(Summer, 6th month)- <21>

**Summary**

This poem by Chu Yohan, written in June 1934 (the year Kapsul), expresses deep disillusionment and sorrow. It contrasts grand, unfulfilled ambitions with a desire for quiet retreat. The poet speaks of unwavering loyalty, likely to a cause or leader, even in the face of failure. The poem laments the fall of a leader ("general's star") which plunges the world into darkness, and contrasts the resilience of nature (bamboo, pine) with the poet's own premature aging and despair. For historians, the poem offers insight into the atmosphere of hopelessness and suppressed nationalism among some Korean intellectuals during the heightening Japanese colonial oppression in the mid-1930s. The lament over fallen leadership and personal despair likely reflects the political realities and thwarted aspirations of the time.

甲戌年有感懷
						주요한
물속에 龍이려니
뭇헤선 버레로다.
席天闢地의 뜻 두고 못일찐대
찰아리
碧水淸溪에
한가한 몸 되리라.

白玉을 버인 살과
水晶을 쪼갠 눈과
그린 듯 고운 멥시
임께 한 번 바첫스메
다시야
어느 뉘품 속에
안길 줄이 잇스랴.＜20＞

大丈夫 세상에 나서
國事로 뜻 둘진대
劍山彈雨란들
마다고할까 보냐
將星이
보람 업시 떨어지니
한층 캄캄하여라

대나무 바람에 치어
곳도 새 휘지안코
눈마즌 솔닙
갈스록 청청한데
어찌라
하로 아츰에
검든 머리 시엇나니
