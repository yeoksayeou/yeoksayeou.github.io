**Summary**

This article is an administrative notice outlining the subscription and payment policies for Kaebyŏk magazine and related publications in 1924. It mandates advance payment for subscriptions and postage, details procedures for handling payment shortages, specifies the use of postal transfer accounts, prohibits payment via stamps (except with a surcharge in remote areas), refuses cash-on-delivery or parcel post, requires itemized payments for multiple publications, and stipulates requirements for receipts, refunds, and address changes. From a historical perspective, the notice reveals the operational details of a Korean publishing house during the colonial period, including its reliance on the Japanese postal system (postal transfers, handling of mail to Japan proper), the challenges of reaching subscribers in remote areas, and the specific financial mechanisms used. The strict policies on payment methods might reflect economic conditions or attempts to manage business efficiently under colonial constraints.
