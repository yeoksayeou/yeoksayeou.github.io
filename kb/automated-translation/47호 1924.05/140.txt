Alas, Crown Prince Sado
						Ch'ŏngo

The 500-year history of the Yi Dynasty is a history of blood and tears. Not only were there endless literati purges (士禍) and military calamities (兵禍) generation after generation, but wars among blood relatives also arose repeatedly within the Yi royal family. Sometimes brothers killed each other, sometimes uncles and nephews fought for power, and sometimes fathers and sons could not tolerate each other. First, T'aejong injured the bonds of father and son with T'aejo by plotting the murder of his two younger brothers, Pangsŏk and Pangbŏn. Next, Sejo extinguished the way of uncle and nephew by banishing and secretly killing Tanjong. Following that, Yŏngjong wrongfully killed Crown Prince Changhŏn (Sado). Among these many histories of blood and tears, the most tragic and mournful is the wrongful death of Crown Prince Changhŏn. Although he was the Crown Prince of a nation's king and his son also became the king of a nation, he, in the prime of his life at 28, received a merciless punishment from his father the King without a shred of crime or a single fault, becoming a vengeful spirit in a wooden rice chest (뒤지). This Crown Prince Changhŏn (name Hŏn 愃, courtesy name Yun'gwan 允寬, art name Ŭijae 毅齋) was the Crown Prince of King Yŏngjong, the 21st monarch of the Yi Dynasty. His nature was firm, resolute, brave, and courageous, his martial arts skills were outstanding, and he was also well-versed in literary arts. At that time, the nation's governance was declining due to superficiality and literary weakness, and powerful ministers and relatives by marriage ran rampant in the court, causing affairs to worsen day by day. The Crown Prince, who clearly saw this, could not bear to watch silently. He frequently presented policies to his father the King for improving the administration, eliminating the influence of maternal relatives, and breaking down factions. However, the obstinate old King did not listen to this, merely regarding the Crown Prince as a rebellious son, becoming angry, and distancing himself. The Crown Prince, whose courageous heart seethed with frustration, having failed to gain his father's approval for his aspirations, had nowhere to exert his world-covering energy. He wandered inside and outside the capital (洛中 洛外), sometimes observing the people's conditions, frequenting pleasure quarters (柳巷花陌), and associating with heroic youths. During the autumn winds and falling leaves, he climbed Namhansan Mountain, stroked his sword, and thought of avenging the nation's shame, shedding tears of indignation and grief. On nights of white snow and cold winds, he rode his horse to Ch'ŏngsŏk Pass (靑石關) to examine the battle sites of the Imjin War. On clear and bright spring days, he visited Onyang Hot Springs (溫陽溫泉), viewed flowers, planted trees, and enjoyed the pleasures of nature. (The Hand-Planted Pagoda Tree at Onyang Hot Springs Spirit Pagoda Platform exists today - 溫泉靈槐臺今有手植槐). One night, the Crown Prince, as usual, secretly escaped the palace and proceeded step by step without a set destination, exiting through the South Gate (Namdaemun). The night was already deep, all sounds were silent (萬籟俱寂), and all the city's people were deeply asleep in the mysterious land of dreams. Standing alone on the vast ground, looking up at the blue sky and letting out a long cry, the Crown Prince was like a lion escaped from a deep forest, wandering without knowing where to go. The moon of the fifth watch already hung on the western hills, and the scattered stars were already dispersed in the eastern sky. The Crown Prince, not feeling the fatigue of the long journey <124>, arrived at Suwŏn Fortress without realizing it. The clear stream of Hwach'ŏn flowed murmuring by his ears, and from a house near Maehwanggyo Bridge, a flickering lantern shone through the brushwood fence. The Crown Prince, without asking whose house it was, went straight and knocked on the gate. After countless calls, the owner finally came out. The owner was a sturdy, strong-boned man of about 40. He scolded the Crown Prince, asking what kind of person would come to someone's house at night and behave rudely. The Crown Prince, without saying anything specific, claimed to be Master Yi from Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul) visiting Suwŏn for pleasure. The owner became even more suspicious, thinking he was a bandit, took a large club, and tried to strike the Crown Prince fiercely. However, the Crown Prince did not fight back but fled and returned to Kyŏngsŏng. Not only did the Crown Prince not mind the man's rudeness in the slightest, but he inwardly praised the man's bold spirit and bearing, and the next day sent an envoy to give the man a large reward. Seeing this one incident, one can know how magnanimous his spirit and tolerance were. How could he have known that the moon of P'aldal and the water of Hwach'ŏn would become a connection in another life? The fact that later King Chŏngjo moved his tomb to Hwasan and built the fortress in Suwŏn was also not a coincidence. The protagonist of this legend, Crown Prince Changhŏn, probably did not know that his own tragic remains would soon be eternally buried beneath this ground in Suwŏn. Alas, the protagonist of yesterday's legend became the protagonist of today's tragedy. The song of long-lasting sorrow is carried on the sighing pines of Hwasan, and the tears of grief and indignation are sent down the long flow of Hwach'ŏn. The heaven-piercing devotion and effort of the filial son King Chŏngjo condensed to become the foundation stones of Suwŏn Fortress. Now, its gate towers and palace halls are collapsing east and west, presenting only a heartbreaking sight amidst the spring winds and autumn rains.
Furthermore, King Yŏngjong one day gathered his close ministers before him and discussed state affairs. The King proposed that to establish the nation's foundation for a hundred years, nothing was better than first recapturing Japan's Tsushima Island to firmly guard the gateway. While all the ministers remained silent and speechless, the Crown Prince confidently stepped forward from the ranks and submitted, "The nation's enemy is Qing China, not Japan. Furthermore, speaking in terms of future grand strategy, planning for the continent is not only more advantageous than planning for an island nation, but since the previous king suffered the shame of the Pyŏngja year (丙子), it is right to avenge this." Upon hearing these words, Yŏngjong turned pale in great surprise, declared, "This child will ruin the country," and ordered him away. This was out of fear that if these words were heard in Qing China, there would be cause for inquiry and rebuke. However, the Crown Prince laughed heartily, spoke thus, and withdrew: "Indeed, Qing is a great country. But I have sufficient calculation for victory, so if you would test me by lending me military authority, I shall defeat Qing in one stroke and present a victory song before Your Majesty." Yŏngjong became even more furious, again scolding him as a child of great treason and impiety, and thereafter distanced himself increasingly from the Crown Prince. Meanwhile, the King's favored Princess Hwawan (the Crown Prince's full sister) and Royal Concubine Mun (文淑儀) frequently <125> slandered the Crown Prince's excesses in the palace, and several treacherous ministers reported that the Crown Prince was gathering followers and plotting rebellion. Yŏngjong was half-believing and half-doubting when finally, a certain palace servant from the Eastern Palace (Crown Prince's residence), having committed an offense against the Crown Prince and fearing that harm would befall him, falsely reported to the King that the Crown Prince had committed heinous acts (at that time, the Crown Prince had visited P'yŏngyang). The King became greatly enraged, marshaled a large number of palace guards, arrested the Crown Prince, and threw him into prison. Thus, even this world-renowned hero, the Crown Prince, could only shed tears of grief and indignation and groan behind iron bars. At that time, the Crown Prince's beloved son, King Chŏngjo, was only 11 years old. King Chŏngjo, who had been extremely filial since childhood, saw his father imprisoned, clung to his grandfather King's royal robes, wept, and pleaded tearfully to bear his father's fate instead. However, the senile Yŏngjong kicked away even this beloved grandson. Human misfortune is unpredictable from morning to evening. The son of the sovereign in the morning became a prisoner in the evening. Like a fierce tiger trapped in a cage, he could only roar futilely and await the day of his death. The Crown Prince's pitiful life moved even the prison guards to tears, and they secretly offered him rice balls and water.
For this crime, the prison guard was also killed under Yŏngjong's wrathful sword. Alas, what could a hero do when fortune turns against him? On the sixth day, the Crown Prince finally met his tragic end. The time was the 21st day of the intercalary 5th month of the Imjin year (壬午), the 38th year of King Yŏngjong's reign. (Some say he died by poison, others say he was put into a wooden rice chest which was nailed shut and killed.) This is truly a great human tragedy. Under the power of a monarch, even the grace between father and son disappears, and under the slander of treacherous villains, even flesh and blood destroy each other. At that time, Left State Councilor Yi Hu and Right State Councilor Min Paekhyang, lamenting the Crown Prince's wrongful death, committed suicide one after the other. Later, Yŏngjong also repented, granted the posthumous title 'Sado' (思悼) to the Crown Prince, and executed the wicked men who had falsely implicated the Crown Prince.
Fourteen years after this tragic curtain closed, Yŏngjong passed away and Chŏngjo ascended the throne. Chŏngjo was a monarch of heaven-born filial piety. Although he occupied the throne of supreme power and possessed the wealth <126> of the four seas, his heaven-piercing resentment did not cease for a moment. First, he elevated his father's posthumous title to 'Changjo' (莊祖), raising him to the rank of king, welcomed the body buried at Paebongsan Mountain in Yangju into the palace, moved it to Hwasan in Suwŏn with the rites of a state funeral, named the tomb Hyŏllyungnŭng (顯隆陵), observed mourning for his father throughout his life, stripped Princess Hwawan of her title and confined her to Kyodong Island, and destroyed her adopted son Chŏng Hugyŏm. (After the Crown Prince's wrongful imprisonment, Hwawan conspired with powerful ministers and attempted to plot against Chŏngjo.) The King constantly paid respects at the Hwasan Royal Tomb to console the spirit of his ill-fated father. (Because Chŏngjo visited the Hwasan tomb constantly, a proverb even arose: "Making tomb visits like crazy, going 29 times a month.") His ever-deepening longing and affection made it difficult to leave the Hwasan Royal Tomb, and he eventually planned to move the national capital to the vicinity of Hwasan. First, he ordered geomancers to survey the land and decided to build fortress walls. Initially, the outer wall was planned from the Kwanggyosan range through the Ch'ilbosan range and the Semadae (original name Toksŏng) range, with Paldalsan as the inner citadel, and construction was about to begin. Then, coincidentally one night, he saw white snow fall only around Paldalsan and declared this was Heaven's will, abandoning the outer wall plan and limiting the fortress area to Paldalsan. Thereupon, construction began and was completed in three years. He named the fertile fields in the north Taehyup'yŏng (大有坪) and dug a reservoir called Manjŏk'ŏ (萬石渠) to prepare for droughts. Furthermore, he built a long embankment in the west, calling it Chungmanje (祝萬堤), dug Tongho (East Lake) in the east and Namji (South Pond) in the south, and ordered trees to be planted every spring and autumn. The regulations specified: 1 sŏk of maple seeds (楓實), 1 pong of mannyŏnji (萬年枝 - likely a type of evergreen seed), 2 sŏk of pine nuts (松子), 1 sŏk of Hovenia dulcis seeds (枳子), 2 sŏk 5 tu of mulberry fruit (桑椹), 2 sŏk of chestnuts (栗), 42 sŏk 13 tu of acorns (橡實), 2,350 plum trees (李木), 582 peach, apricot, and various fruit trees (桃杏 各種 果木), and in addition, flowering plants, willows, lotuses, etc. Today's densely wooded areas inside and outside Suwŏn Fortress, Chang'anmun (North Gate), P'aldalmun (South Gate), Hwasŏmun (West Gate), Ch'angnyongmun (East Gate), Hwahongmun (Water Gate), Panghwasuryujŏng Pavilion, East and West Command Posts (將臺), the Temporary Palace (Haenggung, now Hwaryŏngjŏn Hall), Chungmanje (West Lake - Sŏho), Manjŏk'ŏ (North Pond - Pukchi), Yongyŏn Chijidae, and other structures are relics from that time. Chŏngjo organized all these facilities and was about to realize his grand plan of moving the capital, but Heaven allowed a single basketful of earth to be missing from the Great King's nine-fathom high achievement (九仞之功에 一簣를 노케 하야 - idiom meaning to fail just before completion) and summoned him one night to the White Jade Pavilion in the sky (白玉樓中 - poetic term for death). The grand enterprise of moving the capital also turned into a spring dream. Alas, Crown Prince Sado's 28-year tragedy, King Chŏngjo's 49-year life—looking back on past events is truly filled with deep emotion. Life is short, and art is long. Though 125 years have passed since things changed and stars moved (物機星移 125載) (King Chŏngjo passed away in the Kyŏngsin year, the 24th year of his reign, 125 years ago from now), and the pavilions are broken and the fortress walls have crumbled, as long as the name of Suwŏn does not disappear, the tear stains and traces of the legacy of the utmost filial and sincere Chŏngjo will surely remain eternally imperishable. The fragrant grass of Manjŏk'ŏ is green year after year, and the cuckoos of Hwasan cry mournfully every night. But alas, the royal grandson does not return— -Deletion Below- <127>

**Summary**

The article recounts the tragic story of Crown Prince Sado (Changhŏn) of the Joseon Dynasty, emphasizing his potential, his conflict with his father King Yŏngjo fueled by court intrigue, and his unjust death in a rice chest. It then details the profound filial piety of his son, King Chŏngjo, who posthumously honored his father, punished those responsible for his death, and initiated the construction of the magnificent Suwŏn Hwasŏng Fortress as part of a plan to move the capital near his father's tomb, a plan ultimately unfulfilled due to Chŏngjo's own death. The author laments the tragedy and celebrates Chŏngjo's enduring legacy embodied in Suwŏn. From the perspective of Korean colonial history, this article, published in 1924, is interesting as it focuses intensely on a Joseon Dynasty tragedy and the subsequent acts of filial piety and national building (Suwŏn Fortress). This narrative could serve as a veiled expression of national consciousness and pride, lamenting past misfortunes while highlighting Korean historical achievements and virtues like filial piety during a period of foreign rule. The specific detail about Sado advocating an attack on Qing China rather than Japan's Tsushima might also have held contemporary resonance.

李朝 5백년 역사는 血의 歷史오 淚의 歷史다. 世世로 士禍, 兵禍가 綿綿不絶함은 물론이오 李氏  王家에도 骨肉의 전쟁이 踵起하야 혹은 형제가 殺戮하고 혹은 叔侄이 쟁탈하고 父子가 不相容하얏다. 先에 太宗이 芳碩 芳蕃 兩弟를 謀殺하야 太祖와 父子의 恩이 傷하고 次에 世祖가 端宗을 放遂陰殺하야 叔侄의 道가 滅하고 其次에는 英宗이 世子 莊獻을 枉殺하얏다. 此 許多한 血淚의 역사 중에 最히 悲絶하고 哀絶한 것은 莊獻世子의 寃死다. 身이 一國 君王의 世子가 되고 子가 또한 一國의 君王이 되엿건만 그는 28세의 壯年으로 一毫의 죄와 一点의 過가 업시 父王에게 無慘의 刑을 受하야 木櫃(뒤지) 중의 冤魂이 되얏다. 이 莊獻世子(名愃字允寬號毅齋)는 李朝 21代 英宗大王의 世子엿다. 資性이 剛毅勇敢하고 武藝가 絶倫하며 文藝가 또한 兼備하얏다. 당시 國政은 浮華文弱에 沉衰하고 權臣戚黨이 궁중에서 跋扈하야 事가 日로 非함매 此를 洞察한 世子는 黙然이 看過함을 忍치 못하얏다. 時時로 父王께 時政改善과 外戚退治와 朋黨打破의 策을 獻하얏다. 그러나 老頑한 父王은 此를 聽치 안이 하고 但히 世子를 不軌의 子로 知하고 忿怒할 뿐이오 踈遠할 뿐이엿다. 勇心이 鬱勃한 世子는 旣히 父王에게 志를 得치 못함매 그 盖世의 氣를 伸할 곳이 업섯다. 洛中 洛外로 방황하야, 혹은 民情도 시찰하고 柳巷花陌으로 출입하며 豪傑兒도 聯結하얏다. 秋風落木의 際에 南漢山에 登하야 釰을 撫하고 國恥를 雪할 事를 思하다가 慷慨悲憤의 淚도 下하고 白雪寒風의 夜에 馬를 馳하고 靑石關에 臨하야 壬辰의 戰跡도 察하고 天朗氣淸한 春和의 日에 溫陽溫泉에 臨하야 花도 觀하며 樹도 植하야 자연의 趣를 樂하기도 하 얏다.(溫泉靈槐臺今有手植槐) 一夜는 世子가 例와 如히 비밀이 궁중을 탈출하야 所向을 定치 안이하고 1步에 1步를 進하야 南大門을 出하얏다. 夜色은 己深하야 萬籟가 俱寂하고 全 市人은 모다 신비의 夢鄕의 方酣하얏다. 廣濶한 대지에 홀로 立하야 蒼穹을 望하고 長嘯히는 世子는 맛치 深林을 탈출한 獅子가 所向을 知치 못하고 방황함과 갓텃다. 五更의 月은 이미 西山에 掛하고 三五의 星은 벌서 東天에 散하얏다. 世子는 長途의＜124＞ 피곤함을 感치 안이하고 不知中에 水原城에 到하얏다. 華川의 淸溪가 耳邊에 潺潺히 흐르는뎨 梅香橋畔의 一家에서 耿耿한 殘灯이 籬間으로 射照한다. 世子는 不問誰家하고 直히 往하야 門戶를 叩하얏다. 千呼萬喚에 주인은 비로소 나왓다. 그 주인은 40가량의 장대한 硬骨漢이엿다. 야간에 엇더한 者가 人家에 來하야 無禮한 행동을 하는냐고 世子를 叱責하얏다. 世子는 아모라는 말도 업시 京城 李書房으로 水原에 유람왓다고 하얏다. 주인은 더욱 의심하야 賊漢으로 思하고 大棍棒을 持하고 世子를 猛打하랴고 하얏다. 그러나 世子는 應戰치 안이하고 도피하야 京城으로 還하얏다. 世子는 그 者의 무례한 것을 少毫도 掛念치 안이할 뿐 안이라 心中에 反히 그 者의 壯快한 氣風을 稱賞하고 翌日에 使者를 遣하야 그 자에게 重賞을 與하얏다. 此 一事를 見하야도 그의 氣槪雅量이 如何히 웅대한 것을 可知하겟다. 八達의 月, 華川의 水가 엇지 他生의 緣이 될 줄 知하얏슬리오. 後日 正宗王이 그의 陵을 花山에 移하고 城을 水原에 築한 것은 또한 우연의 事가 안이다. 此 전설의 주인 莊獻世子는 자기의 慘骸가 近將來에 此 水原의 地下에 영원이 매장될 것을 知치 못하얏슬 것이다. 嗚呼 昨日 전슄�의 주인은 今日 비극의 주인이 되얏다. 長恨의 歌를 花山의 松籟에 전하고 悲憤의 淚를 華川의 長流에 送한다. 孝子 正宗王의 徹天의 誠力은 凝하야 水原城의 礎石이 되얏다. 今에 其 城樓, 殿閣도 東頹西壞하야 春風秋雨에 滿目悲凉할 뿐이다.
且說 英宗大王은 一日에 近臣을 御前에 會하고 國事를 議할새 王은 國家百年의 기초를 立하랴면 先히 日本의 對馬島를 탈환하야 關門을 固守함만 갓지 못하다고 제안하얏다. 群臣은 다 黙然하고 無語할 際에 世子는 당당이 出班하야 奏하되 「국가의 敵은 淸國이오 日本이 안이며 且 장래 大計로 言할지라도 島國을 圖하는이보다 대륙을 圖함이 有利할 뿐 안이라 先王이 丙子의 恥가 有한즉 此를 雪함이 可하다고 하얏다」 英宗은 此 言을 聞함매 大驚失色하야 국가를 망할 자는 此兒라 하고 叱退하얏다. 此는 其 言이 淸國에 入聞되면 問責의 擧가 有할가 恐함이다. 그러나 世子는 呵呵大笑하면서 이와 가티 말하고 退하얏다. 「과연 淸國은 大國이다. 그러나 나는 十分의 勝算이 有하니 試하야 兵權을 借하면 一擧에 淸을 破하고 凱歌를 御前에 奏하리라」고. 英宗은 더욱 激怒하야 大逆無道의 兒라 또 叱責하고 此後로는 益益히 世子를 踈遠히 하얏다. 然中에 王의 寵愛하는 和緩翁主(世子 同腹妹)와 文淑儀가 時時로＜125＞ 궁중에서 世子의 無度함을 讒言하고 또 幾個의 奸臣輩는 世子가 徒黨을 嘯聚하야 不軓를謀한다 告하얏다. 英宗은 半信半疑하다가 마참 東宮의 掖隷某가 世子에게 죄를 得하고 禍가 及할가 恐하야 上에게 世子의 凶悖한 행동이 有한 事를 誣告하니 (其時 世子가 平壤에 往한 事가 有함) 王이 大怒하야 盛히 兵衛를 陳하고 世子를 拏致하야 獄에 下하니 此盖世의 호걸인 世子도 할 수 업시 悲憤의 淚를 含하고 鐵窓下에 신음하게 되얏다. 其時 世子의 愛子 正宗大王은 年이 僅히 11세엿다. 幼少부터 孝心이 極한 正宗王은 父王의 下獄함을 見하고 祖王의 袞袖를 抱하고 泣하며 父王의 命을 代償하기를 哀願하얏다. 그러나 老昏한 英宗은 此 愛孫도 蹴倒하얏다. 인간의 禍는 朝夕難測이다. 朝의 萬乘의 子가 夕에 獄中의 人이 되얏다. 檻中에 入한 猛虎와 가티 虛嘯만 하고 死日을 待할 뿐이엿다. 世子의 可憐한 생활은 獄卒까지도 感泣하야 密히 握飯과 水를 供奉하얏다.
獄卒은 此罪로 因하야 英宗의 怒刀下에 또한 被殺하얏다. 嗚呼 運去英雄奈若何리오. 제6일만에 世子는 遂히 無慘의 最後를 遂하니 時는 英宗38년 壬午 閠5월 21일이다.(혹은 藥死라 하고 혹은 木櫃에 入하고 鐵釘을 下하야 殺하얏다 云함) 此는 참 인간의 大悲劇이다. 君主의 권력의 下에는 父子의 恩도 업고 奸細의 讒言下에는 骨肉도 相剗한다. 당시 左相 李厚와 右相 閔百祥은 世子의 寃死를 念恨이 思하고 相繼自殺하고 其後 英宗도 또한 悔悟하야 世子를 思悼라 賜謚하고 世子를 誣陷한 凶漢도 處刑하얏다.
此 悲幕을 閉한 후 14년에 英宗이 昇遐하고 正宗이 즉위하니 正宗은 出天의 孝가 有한 人君이엿다. 비록 身이 萬乘의 位에 在하고 富가＜126＞ 四海를 有하얏슬지라도 徹天의 恨은 잠시도 休치 안이하얏다. 先히 父王의 謚를 莊祖로 하야 왕위에 陞하고 楊州 拜峰山에 매장한 시체를 궁중에 迎하야 國葬의 禮로 水原花山에 移葬하고 其 陵를 顯隆이라 號하고 일생에 父王의 喪을 服하며 또 和緩翁主의 爵을 削하야 喬桐에 安置하고 其 養子 鄭厚謙을 破하얏다.(世子冤獄後 和緩은 또 權臣과 결탁하고 正宗을 謀害코자 한 事가 有함) 王은 無時로 花山御陵에 叅拜하야 命薄한 父王의 靈을 慰하얏스나(正宗이 無時로 花山陵에 幸行한 故로 속담에 못처럼 陵叅奉을 하니 1개월에 擧動이 29회란 말까지 생겻다.) 彌彌切切한 哀慕와 情은 花山의 御陵을 離키 難하야 遂히 國都를 花山近所에 遷하랴고 계획하얏다. 先히 地師를 命하야 地를 相하고 城郭을 築하기로 決하얏다. 최초에는 光敎山脉으로부터 七寶山脉 及 洗馬臺(本名 禿城)山脉을 外廓으로 하고 八達山을 內廓으로 정하야 기공하랴고 하얏더니 우연이 一夜에 白雪이 八達山 주위에만 降함을 見하고 此는 天意라 하야 外廓은 廢하고 城의 구역을 八達山에 限하야 정하얏다. 이에 工을 起하야 凡三歲에 畢役하고 북부의 沃野를 大有坪이라고 名하고 萬石渠라 云하는 貯水池를 鑿하야 旱害를 備하며 更히 서부에 長한 築堤를 하야 祝萬堤라 칭하고 東部에 東湖, 南部에 南池를 鑿하고 매년 春秋에 樹를 植케 하니 其 규정이 楓實1石, 萬年枝1封, 松子2石, 枳子1石, 桑椹2石 5斗, 栗2石, 橡實42石 13斗, 李木2,350株, 桃杏 각종 果木582株, 此外 花卉 柳蓮 등이다. 今日 水原의 城內外에 鬱密한 樹木과 長安( 北門), 八達(南門), 華西(西門), 蒼龍(東門), 華虹門(水門), 訪花隨柳亭, 東西將臺, 行宮(今華寧殿), 祝萬堤(西湖), 萬石渠(北池), 龍淵遲遲臺 기타 건물은 당시 遺物이다. 正宗은 此 萬般의 設備를 정리하고 遷都의 雄圖를 실현하랴다가 天은 大王의 九仞의 功에 一簣를 노케 하야 一夜白玉樓中으로 召還하얏다. 遷都의 大業도 一場의 春夢으로 化하얏다. 嗚呼 思悼世子의 28세 비극 正宗大王의 49년 生涯 往事를 회고하면 실로 感慨無量하다. 인생은 短하고 예술은 長하다. 物機星移 125載를 經한 今日에(正宗 24년 庚申 昇遐 距今 125년) 樓閣은 破하고 城壁은 壞하얏스나 水原의 名이 消滅치 안이한 이상에는 至孝至誠한 正宗의 淚痕과 遺業의 跡은 永久히 不滅하겟다. 萬年堤의 芳草는 年年이 푸르고 花山의 杜鵑은 밤마다 슬피 운다. 그러나 嗚呼 王孫歸不歸 -以下削除-＜127＞
