While Finishing the Editing

Truthfully, without considerable perseverance (根氣), one would lack the courage (勇力) to say this or that again. It wasn't just once, but two, three times, repeatedly, that we were picked on and snatched at, so no matter how firmly our feet were planted on the very bottom layer (맨 밋층), we couldn't help but be shaken. Honestly, fear arises. However, considering our circumstances and situation, exercising ample patience, and mustering courage ten thousand times over (萬番) has resulted in the contents of this May issue (5月號).

May, while on one hand having a special meaning that makes us feel apologetic (恐縮), is on the other hand a month of joy (歡喜). It is the commemorative month of the world labor movement and the month marking the beginning (萌始月) of the Korean youth movement. It is thus a meaningful and eventful (多事) month. However, we share our disappointment with the readers for not being able to fully introduce that meaning and those many events as they are.

As the whole world (世上) knows, two great, happy facts have emerged for us. The Korean Labour-Farmer General Federation (朝鮮勞農總同盟) is one, and the Korean Youth General Federation (朝鮮靑年總同盟) is the second. Even though we have received these two great facts, these happy phenomena, straight into our burning (?) hearts (쓀•가슴), it is all the more regrettable that we have become unable to freely express our joy (歡喜), earnest discussion (懇談), and words (辭) of blessing (祝福) regarding them. Truthfully, we are enduring it, thinking perhaps it is not yet the time to have a showdown (決判) with them.

As previously announced (豫告), this issue (本號) was planned as the Kyŏnggi Province Issue (京畿道號). The initial plan (經營) was for all staff members (全社員) to mobilize fully over the three or four months prior, aiming to make this May issue an Expanded Kyŏnggi Issue (京畿倍大號). However, as things don't always go as planned (世事不如意), this time only a portion of the articles on Kyŏnggi (and even those, due to the company's many pressing circumstances (多端한 사정), are just a general outline of the situation (外觀의 大槪)) are being published. It has been decided that articles focusing on Kyŏngsŏng (京城), along with Inch'ŏn (仁川) and others, will be published next June (來 6월).

**Summary**

This editorial postscript from *Kaebyŏk* magazine expresses the editors' profound frustration with apparent censorship ("picked on and snatched at" repeatedly), which instilled fear but was endured. They highlight May's significance for international labor and the nascent Korean youth movement. The piece celebrates the recent founding of the Korean Labour-Farmer General Federation and the Korean Youth General Federation but laments the inability to freely discuss or praise these major developments, hinting at a strategic decision to avoid direct confrontation ("not yet the time to have a showdown") with authorities. It concludes by explaining that the planned expanded special issue on Kyŏnggi Province had to be postponed and published only in part due to unspecified difficulties ("many pressing circumstances"), with the rest deferred to the June issue. For historians, this article vividly illustrates the restrictive political climate and censorship faced by Korean publications under Japanese rule in the 1920s. It also underscores the concurrent rise of organized labor and youth movements, the editors' commitment to covering these developments despite risks, and the practical challenges (possibly financial or logistical, compounded by political pressure) affecting publishing operations.

편즙을 맛치면서
實上말이지 여간한 根氣로는 다시 이러구 저러구 할 勇力이 업겟슴이다. 한 번도 안이오 두 번 세 번 곱집어 집어채닛가 아무리 맨 밋층에 딱 부튼 발이지만 안이 들먹거릴 수 업슴니다. 實上 공포가 생김니다. 그러나 처지와 경우를 생각하고 십분 참으면서 萬番 용기를 내인 것이 이 5月號의 내용이외다.
5월은 별 다른 의미를 가진 一邊은 恐縮거리면서도 一邊은 歡喜하는 달이외다. 세계노동운동의 紀念月이요 朝鮮 소년운동의 萌始月이외다. 이러케 의미 깁고 多事한 달이외다. 그러나 그 의미와 그 多事를 그대로 충분히 소개치 못함을 讀者와 더부러 섭섭히 생각함니다.
世上이 다- 아는 바와 갓치 우리는 두 가지 큰 깃븐 사실이 생겻슴니다. 朝鮮勞農總同盟이 그 한아이요 朝鮮靑年總同盟이 그 둘이외다. 이 두 가지 큰 사실 깃븐 현상을 쓀•가슴에 탁 밧아 놋코도 그에 대한 歡喜, 懇談, 祝福의 辭를 마음대로 하지 못하게 되얏슴이 더욱 섭섭하외다. 實上 말슴이지 아직은 저들과 決判할 시기가 안인가 하야 참아감니다.
豫告한 바와 갓치 本號는 京畿道號이외다. 첫 經營은 3,4 兩 個月의 時日로 全社員이 총출동하야 이 5月號로써 京畿倍大號를 하랴 하얏더니 世事不如意하야 이번은 京畿의 一部 記事만(그도 社의 多端한 사정에 의하야 外觀의 大槪뿐) 發布하고 來 6월로써 京城을 중심하야 仁川 기타의 記事를 발표하기로 되얏슴니다.
