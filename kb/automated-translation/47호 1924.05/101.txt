△Urgent Company Notice△

Our company (弊社), which has hitherto striven for substance and put into practice (懋實力行) a reader-oriented (讀者本位) approach, has frequently and irregularly published double-sized issues (倍大號), enlarged issues (增大號), or otherwise temporary (臨時號) or special issues (特別號) whenever we captured something significant, whether spatially or temporally.

As a result of this excessive practice (濫行) of irregular publishing (無常出判), errors (誤錯) in the magazine fees (誌代) and shipping costs (送料) entrusted for sending (送托) daily by readers from various regions (各地方) have finally become extremely numerous and severe (夥甚). This repeatedly causes mutual trouble (互相間의 煩惑을 層生케함), which we truly believe is an enormous obstacle (莫大한 障碍) to the improvement of the company's fortunes (社運向上).

At the same time, out of urgent necessity (必要上) to rectify (矯捄) this situation without delay, we hereby decisively implement (斷行) the revision of the magazine's fixed price (雜誌定價의 改正), a long-pending issue (多年懸案), as follows. Accordingly (라서), we also append notes (主義件) regarding sending money (送金). We earnestly request (懇望) that all our esteemed readers (愛讀者諸賢) pay special attention (特別用意) to this company notice (社告) from now on.

(Kaebyŏk Fixed Price Revision Table) (開闢定價改正表)

**Summary**

The publisher of *Kaebyŏk* magazine announces an urgent revision to its pricing structure. They explain that their frequent practice of publishing various enlarged or special issues, while intended to serve readers by capturing timely content, has led to widespread errors and confusion regarding subscription fees and shipping costs sent by readers across different regions. This situation has become a major hindrance to the company's operations. Therefore, they are implementing a new, fixed pricing system (details presumably followed in a table not included in the source) and provide new instructions for sending payments, urging readers to take careful note.

This notice offers insight into the practical business challenges faced by a Korean publication during the colonial period. The effort to publish special issues responsive to events ("空間的으로나 時間的으로나 무엇을 捕捉하기만하면") suggests journalistic ambition, but the resulting financial and logistical complexity highlights the difficulties of managing distribution and payments ("誌代及送料의 誤錯이 夥甚") across regions under potentially underdeveloped or restrictive colonial infrastructure. Historians might find the specific mention of these operational difficulties and the formal appeal to readers useful for understanding the publishing environment and reader relations of the time.
