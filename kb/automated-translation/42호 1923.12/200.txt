What Kind of Person was King T'aebong Kim Kungye?
						By One Reporter

King T'aebong Kim Kungye's other name was Kungye (躬乂), and he was an illegitimate son of King Hŏnan of Silla. He was born on the 5th day of the 5th month, and from birth, he had teeth, and furthermore, a ray of white light stretched from the roof like a long rainbow. Due to the superstition, commonly忌 feared, that a child born on the 5th day of the 5th month is unfavorable to its parents, the king thought Kungye was ominous, did not raise him, and threw him down from a pavilion. A wet nurse, finding this pitiful, secretly received him and carried him away, but accidentally blinded him in one eye. After growing up, Kungye shaved his head and became a monk, calling himself Sŏnjong. However, possessing a magnanimous courage, he often did not adhere to the trivial monastic rules. Once, while going to solicit alms with his bowl (鉢), a crow dropped an ivory slip (牙籤) it was carrying into the bowl; it had the character for "King" (王) on it. Kungye was secretly overjoyed and conceited, kept this hidden, and did not speak of it to others. At that time, Silla was gradually weakening, political discipline was in disarray, and bandits rose up everywhere. Seeing that among them, the bandit Yang Kil of Pukwŏn (present-day Wŏnju) was the most powerful, Kungye thought it a golden opportunity of a thousand years and threw in his lot with Yang Kil. Yang Kil, upon seeing Kungye's character, thought him particularly extraordinary, trusted him implicitly, divided his troops, and gave them to Kungye. Kungye established a base at Yŏngwŏn Fortress (in Wŏnju) and conquered the four counties to the east: Chuch'ŏn, Naesŏng, Ultto, and Ŏjin. All the various bandits surrendered upon hearing of his reputation. Kungye then proclaimed himself king. Also, always harboring resentment for having been rejected by his father king, he took advantage of this opportunity and circulated a manifesto everywhere, saying, "Silla, without cause, requested Tang soldiers and destroyed Koguryŏ. This is the lingering resentment of the people of Koguryŏ. I will avenge Koguryŏ." The surviving people of Koguryŏ all rallied to Kungye. Leading his troops south, he reached Hŭngju Temple. Seeing a portrait of the [Silla] king on the temple wall, he drew his sword and struck it; the extent of his resentment can be surmised from this. Initially, he established his capital at Songak and named his country Majin (Chin is the name of ancient Chosŏn). Later, he moved the capital to Ch'ŏrwŏn, changed the country's name to T'aebong, and also changed the era names multiple times, calling them Sudŏk, Manse, and Chŏnggae. As Kungye was originally a monk, even after becoming a monarch, he proclaimed himself Maitreya Buddha, called his eldest son Blue Light Bodhisattva, and his younger son Divine Light Bodhisattva. Day by day, he esteemed luxury <102> and became tyrannical. His wife, Lady Kang, repeatedly admonished him, but he did not listen. Instead, claiming to know of his wife's illicit affairs through the Maitreya Buddha's mind-reading technique (觀心法), he beat Lady Kang to death and also killed their two sons. Among the generals and ministers, those who met violent ends reached 8 or 9 out of 10. Due to this, the people's hearts all turned away from Kungye and toward Wang Kŏn. This naturally brought about Wang Kŏn's success. After Kungye fought Wang Kŏn at Kŏmbullang (present-day P'yŏnggang County) and was defeated, the generals acclaimed Wang Kŏn as king. Kungye sighed deeply and said, "Since Wang Kong (Lord Wang) has obtained the throne, my work is done," and fled, hiding in a cave in Puyang (P'yŏnggang). Suffering severely from hunger and cold, he stole and ate wheat ears from the people's fields and was eventually killed by the populace. His reign as king of T'aebong lasted a total of 18 years. Prior to this, a Tang merchant, Wang Ch'ang-gŭn, obtained a mirror being sold by an old man in the marketplace. The inscription on the mirror said, "In the midst of three waters, under the four corners, the Lord on High sends down a son in Chin and Ma [years]. First seize the Rooster, later strike the Serpent. In the middle of the Duck-Serpent year, two dragons appear. One hides his body amidst green wood, one reveals his form in black metal." Generally, Black Metal (黑金) refers to Ch'ŏrwŏn, and Green Wood (靑木) refers to Songdo. This was indeed a prophecy of the appearance of Wang Kŏn and Kungye. Today, at Sambang Mountain in Ch'ŏrwŏn, there is Kungye's tomb and shrine. Also, at the northern end of Wŏljŏng-ni, three *ri* north of Ch'ŏrwŏn town, are the ruins of the old capital. The perimeter of the outer wall at that time was 14,421 *ch'ŏk*, and the inner wall's perimeter was 1,905 *ch'ŏk*. Furthermore, Kokwŏl-li, the former site of his palace, is about one *ri* to the north; a stone artifact from that time still remains (Height 12 *ch'ŏk*, 8-sided, spherical shape, 5 tiers - likely a pagoda or lantern). In P'yŏnggang, there are also many historical sites related to Kungye: Kwaniltchŏng (at the foot of Hwahyŏn Mountain in P'yŏnggang-myŏn) is said to have this name because Kungye smiled faintly (莞爾而笑) while feasting with music and entertainers there; Kyehyŏn is where Kungye rested while hunting (three *ri* west of the county seat); Kapkich'ŏn (one *ri* west of the county seat) is where Kungye abandoned his armor (棄甲) and fled after being defeated in battle with the Goryeo founder (Wang Kŏn); Ongju P'o is said to be where his princess committed suicide when Kungye fled in defeat (one *ri* west of the county seat); Sach'ŏng Mountain (north of Ongju P'o) was Kungye's military training ground; Chŏnjung P'yŏng (in Hyŏnnae-myŏn, also called Chŏnjung or Chŏnjung) was the royal ceremonial field (籍田) during Kungye's time; Munkwa Chang (popularly called Munkwa Tuduk) (in Tongbyŏn-ni, east of the town) was the state examination site during the T'aebong era. Kŏmbullang is said to be so named because swords were drawn (釰を拂하야) and battle raged fiercely there when fighting against the Goryeo founder. Sinsŏng Mountain Fortress (perimeter 2,510 *ch'ŏk*, in Hyŏnnae-myŏn) is also said to have been built by Kungye. Furthermore, in P'yŏnggang and Ch'ŏrwŏn, the rocks look as if eaten by insects (虫食) (because they are igneous rock). There is a story that because Kungye was constantly tyrannical, when a minister remonstrated, Kungye himself said, "Only when the crow's head turns white, a horse grows horns, and stones grow insects (石生虫) will I perish." Therefore, the Goryeo founder (Wang Kŏn), in order to win the people's hearts, pointed to this igneous rock and declared, "Stones have grown insects." Moreover, because the people of P'yŏnggang killed Kungye, the Yi Dynasty considered it a county where a subject killed his king and suspended it from the state examinations (停擧), not allowing people from P'yŏnggang to take the exams (赴擧). Therefore, during the Yi Dynasty, there were no distinguished officials (名宦) from P'yŏnggang. It is said this restriction was finally lifted during the reign of King Yŏngjo (英廟朝).<103>

**Summary**

This 1923 article recounts the life of Kim Kungye, the founder of the short-lived T'aebong kingdom. Born a Silla prince under supposedly ominous circumstances and abandoned, he became a monk but harbored ambitions. Exploiting Silla's decline and rallying Koguryŏ loyalists, he established his own kingdom, initially called Majin, then T'aebong, with capitals at Songak and later Ch'ŏrwŏn. Despite initial success, he grew tyrannical, proclaiming himself Maitreya Buddha, executing his wife and sons, and alienating his followers, leading to his overthrow by his general Wang Kŏn, the founder of Goryeo. Kungye fled but was eventually killed by commoners. The article also details numerous historical sites and legends in Ch'ŏrwŏn and P'yŏnggang associated with Kungye, including prophecies, place names derived from events in his life, and the local repercussions faced by P'yŏnggang residents during the Joseon Dynasty for having killed him.

From a Korean colonial history perspective, the article is interesting as it presents a detailed narrative of a pre-modern Korean figure and kingdom using traditional historical accounts and local folklore during a period of Japanese rule. While seemingly neutral, the act of documenting and popularizing national history and connecting it to specific Korean locales (Ch'ŏrwŏn, P'yŏnggang) could be seen as a subtle assertion of Korean identity and historical consciousness. The detailed listing of place names and associated legends serves to root the historical narrative firmly in the Korean landscape. The mention of the Joseon Dynasty's discrimination against P'yŏnggang offers a glimpse into regional social history.
