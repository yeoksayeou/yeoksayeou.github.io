寧越道中
						李媛

千里長關三日越, 哀歌唱斷魯陵雲.
妾身亦是王孫女, 此地鵑聲不忍聞.＜70＞

Over a thousand *li* of long passes, crossed in three days,
A mournful song cuts through the clouds of Norŭng.
This humble self is also a king's granddaughter,
In this place, the cuckoo's cry is unbearable to hear.<70>

**Summary**

This short poem, written in classical Chinese (Hanja), describes the author's journey through Yŏngwŏl. Passing through the region associated with the tragic exile and death of King Tanjong (referred to by Norŭng), the author, who identifies herself as a "king's granddaughter," hears the cry of a cuckoo. This sound, traditionally linked to Tanjong's sorrow, becomes unbearable, merging the historical tragedy with the author's personal emotion. For historians, the piece is interesting as it shows the continued resonance of Joseon dynastic history, particularly tragic royal narratives, during the colonial period. It demonstrates the use of traditional literary forms (Hanja poetry) by a female author in a modernizing context to express sentiments connected to Korean identity and history, even under Japanese rule.
