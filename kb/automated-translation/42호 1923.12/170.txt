Local Folk Songs and Children's Songs

Wheat Grinding Song

This song is widely popular in the Ch'unch'ŏn region; that is, Ch'unch'ŏn has many fields (田), and consequently, much wheat (小麥) is grown. In summer, several men or sometimes women form groups and sing this song while turning a t'olmae (mechanical millstone). The melody is generally similar to the Hwanghae-do menari.

Turn it, turn it
Turn this wheat grinder of mine
If you turn this wheat grinder of mine
They say we'll eat salted dried banded grunter
Would someone who doesn't eat salted dried banded grunter
Live in the depths of Sin'gye Koksan?
My body is like white jade (白玉)
I am a disciple (弟子) of Buddha

Elder brother, elder brother, cousin brother
How is life after getting married?
They said bitter herbs (苦草) and Tang herbs (唐草) were pungent
But bitter herbs and Tang herbs are even more pungent
After three years of married life
My hair, like three strands of silk
Has become like tangled mugwort
My hands, like white jade (白玉)
Have become like duck feet
My sister-in-law, like raw silk (生紬)
Why is she such a tale-bearer?

Merchant's Ballad (打鈴)

This is similar to the so-called Frog Ballad (개구리타령) of Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul). Hearing this song, one can roughly guess the products originating from various places in Ch'unch'ŏn.

The maiden from Murŭndaemi
Goes out to sell wild pears (문배)
The maiden from Udu
Goes out to sell pears (참배)
The maiden from Tongnae Kudong
Goes out to sell mountain vegetables (山菜)
The maiden from Myŏngwŏl-li
Goes out to sell wild grapes (멀우)
The maiden from Pangdong
Goes out to sell earthenware (옹기)
The scholar from Sŏha Sŏsang
Goes out to sell silk (明紬)
The maiden from Saembatchang<97>
Goes out to sell rice wine (막걸리)

Loom Song (織機歌)

This song is also popular in Yŏngdong Kan'gan Sŏng, but it is sung much more in Ch'unch'ŏn. That is, because Ch'unch'ŏn has traditionally produced much silk (明紬), white cotton cloth (白木), etc., this song arose.

Warping the threads after going to Kangnŭng
Warping across the thousand-li Kangnŭng river
Spreading them wide like in Sŏul
Setting up the loom on the jade railing (玉欄干)
It seems as if His Majesty (今上), our country's king
Has taken His royal seat (坐御)
What they call the but'e [heddle frame?]
Seems like the Big Dipper (北斗七星) encircling
On the jujube wood danmalko [part of loom?]
What they call the badijip [reed holder]
In the deep valley of white clouds (白雲) and green mountains (靑山)
The blue dragon (靑龍), yellow dragon (黃龍), great yellow dragon (大黃龍)
Sound like they are crying out
Those an'gŭmdang'gŭm ch'oebal [treadles?]
Are pulled back like a wooden mallet
The shuttle, thick as an ox (황소)
Darts in and out like a swallow (제비)
The ing'aetdae [heddle rods] are three brothers
The dungdung'i [roller beam?] is single (獨身)
The samo kajinbigari [reed/beater?]
Why is it doing a sword dance (칼춤)?
The sin'gori [heddle cords?] like a rainbow (무지개)
Melt away the eldest daughter's ankle fatigue
The hwanggyŏng wood puk badijip [shuttle race?]
Melts away the eldest daughter's wrist fatigue
The sword-dancing sin'gori
The dragon-head ends (龍頭머리) that sing well
What they call the tottumari [cloth beam]
Is it an old person's illness (病患)?
Sitting down, getting up, lying down, getting up
What is all this about?
Weaving it all together and beating it
Like the beating drum of ten thousand soldiers (萬軍師)
Weaving it all together and counting the threads
Like the shining of firelight (火光)

Children's Songs (童謠)

The concubine's room is a flower garden (꼿밧)
The wife's room is a lotus pond (연못)<98>
Butterflies play in the flower garden
Carp fish play in the lotus pond

The wench who eats her fill
Of sorghum rice (오조밥) and young radish kimchi (열무김치)
And then sleeps
Cut off her arm to make a trowel (흙손) (흙손 is a tool for earthwork (土役用具))
Carve off her flesh and give it to the dogs

Tick (진득이)

This is a sound children make in dialogue form while tumbling over each other during play.
Hey—tick (진득이)!
What did you eat to live?
Hanging onto a bull's testicle (황소불알)
I gnawed and sucked it all up
And plop, I fell off
Coming travelers (行人), going travelers
Stepped all over me
Crushing my entire belly
The king chestnut bug (왕개암이) is the lead pallbearer (상두군)
The millet chestnut bug (좁살개암이) is the bell ringer (요령군)
The dragonfly (짬자리) is the banner carrier (명정군)
The green frog (청개고리) is the mourner (조상군)
On a fir wood bier frame (전나무쟁강틀)
With pine wood bell handles (잔나무요령자루)
Leaving behind the banner and everything
Bury me in a warm sunny spot (양지)

Ch'unch'ŏn Arirang

Ch'unch'ŏn, ah, Pongŭi Mountain (鳳儀山), farewell
Parting at the Sinyŏn River (新延江) boat landing
Pong Mountain (鳳山) in Ch'unch'ŏn is a famous mountain (명산)
The eight villages within the prefecture (府內八洞) are becoming civilized (開化)
A new road (新作路) is built below Samhak Mountain (三鶴山)
Everyone enjoys the breeze of the automobile (자동차)
In the flowing water of Yanggu Nangch'ŏn
Oh maiden washing cabbage (배추)
Push aside the outer leaves (것대) and bruised leaves (떡닙)
Give me the inner heart (속대)
Am I a lover you saw sometime before
That you ask for the inner heart?
Seeing you now, it's our first meeting (초면)
If we meet later, we'll be acquainted (구면)
Let's forget first meetings and acquaintances
I'm afraid of my parents, I cannot give it<99>
<97-99>

**Summary**

This article presents a collection of folk songs (minyo) and children's songs (tongyo) from the Ch'unch'ŏn region of Korea, gathered in 1923. It includes a wheat grinding song, a merchant's song listing local specialties, a detailed loom song describing the weaving process and loom parts with metaphors, children's rhymes (one contrasting wife and concubine, one violent, one a playful funeral chant), and a local version of "Arirang" reflecting on regional landmarks and modernization. The most interesting aspect is the title "Italy's Folk Songs and Children's Songs," which starkly contrasts with the purely Korean content focused on Ch'unch'ŏn; this likely indicates an editorial error or possibly reflects the older usage "이 딸" (이 땅의 - 'this land's'). For historians, the article is valuable for its documentation of regional folk traditions, linguistic features of 1920s Korean (older spellings), insights into rural life (labor, gender roles like the hardships of married women, local commerce), and the local reception of modernization (new roads, cars) during the colonial period.

이딸의 民謠와 童謠
밀매노래

이 노래는 春川지방에서 만히 유행하는데 즉 春川에는 밧(田)이 만코, 따러서 밀(小麥)이 만히 난다. 녀름이면, 남자나 혹 여자가 몃 명식 떼를 메여, 톨매(機械磨石)를 갈면서 이 노래들을 하는데 音調는 대개 黃海道메나리와 갓다.

둘너주제둘너주게
요내밀매둘너주게
요내밀매둘너주면
준치자반먹는다네
준치자반아니먹는
新溪谷山중이살가
요내몸은白玉이라
부체님의弟子라네

형님형님사촌형님
시집살이엇덥듸가
苦草唐草맵다더니
苦草唐草더맵더라
시집살이三年만에
삼단가튼이내머리
다북쑥이다되얏네
白玉가튼요나손이
오리발이다되얏네
생주가튼시누동생
말 전주가웬일인가

장사打鈴

이것은 京城의 소위 개구리타령 비슷한데 이 노래를 들으면 春川各地의 物産 나는 것을 대개 짐각하겟다.

무른댐이처녀는
문배장사로나간다
牛頭의처녀는
참배장사로나간다
東內九洞처녀는
山菜장사로나간다
明月里처녀는

베틀歌(織機歌)

이 노래는 嶺東干忓城에도 유행되나 春川에서 만히 한다. 즉 春川은 自來로 明紬 白木, 등의 織組를 만히 하는 고로 이 노래가 생긴 것이다.

江陵가서베를날어
千里江陵건너날어
서울가티널니빗겨
玉欄干에베틀노니
우리나라今上님이
坐御하신듯 하구나
부테라하시는것
北斗七星둘너친듯
대초나무단말코에
바듸집이라하시는것
白雲靑山깁푼골에
靑龍黃龍大黃龍이
울고나는소리로다
앙금당금저최발은
나무쇠라후여든다
황소가티굴은북은
제비가티드나든다
잉앳대는삼형제요
둥둥이는獨身이라
사모가 진비갈이는
칼춤이라웬일이냐
무지개가튼신고리는
큰아기발묵을다녹인다
황경나무북바듸집은
큰아기손목을다녹인다
칼춤추는신고리며
소리잘하는龍頭머리
돗투마리라하시는것
늙그신네병환인지
안지실낙누어실낙
이것이다웬일인가
다짜고헤치는것
萬軍師의헤치는듯
다짜고새는것은
火光이비치는듯

童謠

팔을잘너흙손하고(흙손은土役用具)
살을비여개를준다

진득이

이것은 아희들이 작난할 대에 서로 업치락뒤처락한면서, 문답적으로 하는 소리다.
에-라진득아
