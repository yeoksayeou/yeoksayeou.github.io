陟州東海神廟(一名 退潮碑)
此碑本立於三陟萬雲島中間爲風浪激折沿海眉叟許先生爲三陟府使時聞而改書後四十八年己丑府使洪萬紀求得於門生韓塾處大字用舊本小字用新本刻石移竪於鎭營城內竹串島其文如左
This stele originally stood in the middle of Manun Island, Samch'ŏk, but was broken by fierce wind and waves along the coast. When Master Misu Hŏ was the magistrate (府使) of Samch'ŏk, he heard of this and rewrote the inscription. Forty-eight years later, in the Kich'uk year (己丑), Magistrate Hong Man-gi obtained the text from Hŏ Mok's disciple (門生), Han Suk. Using the old text for the large characters and the new text for the small characters, he had it engraved on stone and moved it to stand on Chukkwando, within the walls of the garrison castle (鎭營城內). The text is as follows:

The vast sea stretches boundlessly, where a hundred rivers gather like courtiers paying homage; its greatness is infinite. In the northeast lies the sandy sea, without tide or ebb, known as the Great Marsh (大澤). Accumulated waters reach the heavens, surging and vast. The sea moves with *; Bright, bright Yanggok (暘谷), the gate of the great sun. Hŭi Pŏk (羲伯) manages the reception; at the station of Sŏngmok (析木), the palace of Pin'u (牝牛). East of Japan (日本), nothing exists. The treasures of the mermen (鮫人), the hundred products nurtured by the sea, are abundant and widespread. Strange and wondrous things, auspicious signs in profusion, flourish with virtue and become manifest. The pearl within the oyster waxes and wanes with the moon. Nearby vapors rise like mist. Ch'ŏn O (天吳) with nine heads, the strange Kui (怪夔) with one leg, whirlwinds turn and bring rain. The sun emerges at dawn,<100> clashing and dazzling, purple, red, and azure. When the full moon arrives on the fifteenth, the water-mirror is perfectly round, and the constellations hide their light. Fusang (扶桑) and Sahwa (沙華), the Black-Toothed (黑齒) and Mara (麻羅), the Top-knotted (撮䯻) and P'uga (莆家), the oysters of Yŏnman (蜒蠻), the monkeys of Kwawa (瓜哇), the cattle of Pulche (佛齊) – various tribes from overseas, distinct groups with different customs, are all embraced and nurtured under the same grace. The far-reaching virtue of the ancient sages, conveyed through interpreters by a hundred barbarian tribes (百蠻重譯), subdued all, no matter how distant. How magnificent, how brilliant! The great governance is broad and extensive; its lingering influence is remote indeed.

Appended Text of the P'yŏngsut'o Chanbi (Stele Praising the Pacification of Waters and Land)

衡山碑大禹手篆七十七字中眉叟先生撰四十八字刻于木板而藏于三陟府光武八年九月康洪大及郡守鄭雲哲奉勅爰爲大韓平水土贊碑刻竪于竹串島西
Among the seventy-seven seal script characters on the Mount Hyŏng (衡山) Stele, attributed to Yu the Great (大禹), Master Misu (眉叟先生) selected forty-eight characters, composed [a text], had it carved onto a wooden board, and stored it in the Samch'ŏk prefectural office (三陟府). In the ninth month of the eighth year of Kwangmu (1904), Kang Hong-dae and County Magistrate (郡守) Chŏng Un-ch'ŏl, following imperial command (奉勅), commissioned the carving of the Great Han (大韓) P'yŏngsut'o Chanbi and erected it west of Chukkwando.

Long travels, forgetting home; assisting and supporting the Emperor (帝). Toiling the mind, planning with wisdom; reviving declining affairs, establishing systems. The stabilization of T'aehwa (泰華); marshes and ditches are leveled. Water directed down mountain slopes; fish and beasts reveal their forms, and none fail to prosper. Chungyu (仲鬱) dredged and cleared blockages; the Bright Gate and the Courtyard. Forever feeding the myriad nations.<101>

**Summary**

This article details the history of the "Ebbing Tide Stele" (退潮碑), originally on Manun Island near Samch'ŏk, which was broken by waves. The famed Joseon scholar-official Hŏ Mok (Misu) rewrote the inscription during his tenure as Samch'ŏk magistrate. Decades later, magistrate Hong Man-gi had it re-carved, combining old and new versions, and moved to Chukkwando. The inscription itself is a poetic ode to the East Sea's power, mythical associations, and the reach of ancient sage-kings' virtue. An appended section describes another stele, the "P'yŏngsut'o Chanbi," erected in 1904 under imperial decree of the Korean Empire (Taehan Cheguk), featuring text selected by Hŏ Mok from the legendary Mount Hyŏng Stele attributed to Yu the Great, praising flood control and governance. For historians, the article offers insight into local history preservation in Samch'ŏk, the enduring reverence for figures like Hŏ Mok, the continued influence of classical Chinese literature and mythology in the early 20th century, and a specific instance of monument erection during the Korean Empire period (mentioning Kwangmu and Taehan).
