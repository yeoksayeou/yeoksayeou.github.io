The All-Korea Football Tournament - Why Did It Fizzle Out?
						A Reporter

The 4th All-Korea Football Tournament, hosted by the Chosŏn Sports Association (朝鮮軆育會), which is held once a year like an annual event, was scheduled to take place for three days from the 21st to the 23rd of last December on the grounds of Kyŏngsŏng Hwimun Higher Common School (京城徽文高等普通學校). However, midway through, wave after wave of turmoil arose due to the issue of ineligible players (不正選手問題), ultimately leading to the collapse (瓦解) of the tournament and its indefinite postponement. This is not only known to the world but is also regarded by the world as a matter of great regret. Why did such a significant tournament, composed of at least 22 teams—elementary school teams (小學團), middle school teams (中學團), and youth teams (靑年團) from across Korea, considered the very core (骨髓) of the nation; a tournament that was not the first but had at least three or four prior experiences; a tournament where the organizers declared such solemn principles and the participating sides insisted on such fair teams (템 - "team")—why did it ultimately expose disgraceful situations (醜態雜狀) day after day, fizzle out in collapse (瓦鮮 - likely typo for 瓦解), and end up leaving a great regret in the sports world, indeed, in society in general? Who is to blame (罪) and where does the disgrace (醜) lie will become known in the future, but first, let's write roughly what was seen and heard about the whole course of events of the tournament.

The focal point of the issue was, above all, the "ineligible players" (不正選手). How did the two letters meaning "ineligible" (不正) become exposed, ultimately turning the tournament into chaos (修羅化), when both sides were supposed to handle the player eligibility issue so strictly and fairly? No matter how one thinks about it, it is questionable. Since the collapse of the tournament is a fact, the existence of ineligible players must also be a fact (as there are confessing parties).
However, looking at the section concerning player eligibility in the principles announced by the organizers, the eligibility for players participating in the tournament required that "for Youth Teams (靑年團), members must have been registered with the said team for 3 months or more; for Middle School Teams (中學團) and Elementary School Teams (小學團) (limited to schools equivalent to common schools), students must have been enrolled in the said school for 1 year or more, with certification provided by the respective team leader (會長) or school principal (校長)." Since the organizers clearly stated that eligibility was granted to those who were registered for 3 months or more for Youth Teams and 1 year or more for Middle School and Elementary School Teams, with certification from the respective team leader or school principal, it is assumed that players were admitted under such procedures, and the participating teams also joined under such conditions. Furthermore, since the team leaders and school principals are not just representatives of their teams but also hold considerable status or credibility worthy of public respect (推尊), it should be a fact that there would be no falsehood in this matter.
Despite this, why was ineligibility exposed? Was it the organizers' poor investigation? Was it the fraudulent means (詐欺手段) of the relevant representatives? The blame clearly lies with one party.
As the saying goes, "Where there is much suspicion, a tiger appears" (의심 만흔 곳에 범이 난다), it seems there was suspicion about player eligibility from the beginning, shared by both the organizers and the participating sides.
Thus, on the afternoon of the 19th before the tournament, the organizers' executives (幹部) and the supervisors (監督者) from the participating sides gathered for a meeting regarding the player eligibility issue. After prolonged discussions, they reportedly went as far as identifying ineligible players through individual voting. When the votes were counted, it seemed that almost every team had someone pointed out: "So-and-so from Team X is an ineligible player," "So-and-so from School Y is an ineligible player." After much commotion back and forth (左之右之), they eventually decided to place absolute trust in the certifications provided by the team leaders and school principals. (There was also talk that the principal of a certain Kyŏngsŏng Middle School Team explicitly stated that a player named Chang Mo (張某) was ineligible and would not participate).
In this way, while everyone harbored suspicions of ineligibility, the tournament approached under a makeshift formality (彌縫的 형식).
On the first day of the tournament, the 21st, the morning was dedicated to the preliminary rounds for the elementary school teams, which concluded smoothly without any particular issues. From the afternoon, the middle school team preliminaries began. There were no signs of explosion yet. However, within the ineligible teams themselves, hearts must have been pounding (가슴이 조박조박하야슬 것이요), and among the teams aware of the ineligibility, dissatisfaction must have been simmering (불평이 울눅불눅하야), letting out faint smoke from the vent (噴口의 微烟).
While the elementary school teams were fine, the middle school matches Osan (五山) vs. Sungsil (崇實) and Yŏngsaeng (永生) vs. Hwimun (徽文) were somehow completed amidst nervousness. Next in line was Kwangsŏng (光成) vs. Chungang (中央). The Chungang side, which had been emitting faint smoke for a while, finally burst out with accusations of the opponent's ineligibility. Voices arose claiming Kwangsŏng had 5, or maybe 3, ineligible players (in fact, there was one, who had graduated from Kwangsŏng's 4-year program and re-enrolled in the 5th year this spring, allegedly). The Chungang team formally protested <60> to the organizers, stating they would not compete against the ineligible team. Consequently, the Kwangsŏng vs. Chungang match was postponed until the issue was resolved, and the first day concluded with the Paejae (培材) vs. Yŏngmyŏng (永明) match.
As the ineligibility issue surfaced on the first day, not only the organizers' executives but also all related teams and general spectators were wide-eyed (눈이 휘둥그래지며) and began whispering amongst themselves (숙은숙은 하게 되얏다). The organizers held executive meetings through the night, while participating teams, rubbing their eyes, searched for ineligibility in their opponents. The atmosphere on the night of the 21st was extremely tense.
It was the second day. The Kwangsŏng vs. Chungang match proceeded with Kwangsŏng fielding only 10 players after excluding one ineligible player, ultimately resulting in Kwangsŏng's defeat. At this, the smoldering vents (噴火口) everywhere erupted simultaneously. Kwangsŏng pointed out one ineligible player from Sungsil and protested to the organizers. The Sungsil side accused Osan of having ineligible players, and Osan accused Hwimun – thus, the tournament finally turned into a scene of turmoil (波瀾場). The participating ineligible teams became paralyzed (五獸不働格), creating a bizarre and grotesque spectacle (一大 怪怪罔測한 醜雜狀). On one side, the organizers held executive meetings; on another, matches proceeded with only the non-ineligible teams selected; elsewhere, teams offered excuses, while others apologized – all sorts of farces (滑劇) were performed.
Based on executive meetings and investigations of school records (學籍) and statements from related individuals, the organizers issued expulsion orders (退場 命令) to Hwimun and Sungsil.
Reason: For Hwimun, player Chang Se-wŏn (張世遠), upon investigation of the school register (學籍簿), was found to be 28 days short of the required one-year enrollment period, thus ordered to withdraw according to the tournament regulations. (There was also talk of the school principal admitting fault and withdrawing voluntarily (自過 自退說)). For Sungsil, player Chang Pyŏng-sŏn (張炳善) was ordered to withdraw based on the testimony of Yi Sŏk-ch'an (李錫贊), a teacher at Kwangsŏng School (and one of the tournament referees), who certified that although Chang had been enrolled at Sungsil for three years, he had been registered at Kwangsŏng School for three months during the autumn term of this year (September to November).
With this, what had the tournament become? The next day, Osan also confessed its own ineligibility and withdrew. It seemed that the tournament, though half-paralyzed (半身不遂), had reached some sort of conclusion, but then a major wave of turmoil (一大 波瀾) arose repeatedly – namely, the protest (抗議) from the Sungsil side.
The Sungsil team, having received the expulsion declaration on the afternoon of the second day, vehemently rose up, asserting the unfairness of the expulsion for the sake of the school's honor (名譽) and the player's eligibility. They lodged a protest with the organizers while telegraphing school authorities (學校 當局者) to come and testify with supporting documents (證明書類). They maintained strong opposition from the second day until the third day, when the tournament finally collapsed (瓦解). Here are the main points of contention from both sides: <61> Sungsil's argument:
"Chang Pyŏng-sŏn, identified as an ineligible player from Sungsil School, has been enrolled at Sungsil Middle School for 3 years. Although he was absent for about 3 months from mid-September to mid-November this year, he neither withdrew nor was expelled, and even continued to pay his monthly tuition (月謝金). Furthermore, regarding his 3-month unauthorized absence (無故欠席), the student, his parents (父兄), and witnesses apologized, and the school staff meeting (校員會議) confirmed him as a continuously enrolled student without any punishment. We have the school principal's certification (證明) and other complete documents (文籍), so how can he be called ineligible? While his enrollment at Kwangsŏng in the interim is true, Sungsil had no procedures for withdrawal, transfer, or re-admission. Therefore, Chang Pyŏng-sŏn is clearly a student with 3 years of enrollment."
The organizers' argument:
"The requirement of over one year's enrollment in the tournament regulations was intended as a measure to prevent the traditional harmful practice (弊風) in the sports world, namely player poaching (選手爭奪). Regarding the player in question, Chang Pyŏng-sŏn, although Sungsil School argues otherwise, it is a fact that he moved between this school and that school at will (任去來), which clearly violates the tournament regulations." Ultimately, they rejected Sungsil's protest. Thus, as the evening glow (夕紅) halfway descended over Mount Inwang (仁王山) on the third day, after much back and forth (左之右之), the natural curtain of darkness (黑幕) fell, and simultaneously, the tournament sank amidst the storm (風浪).
Was that all? During the second preliminary round of the Youth Teams on the third day, in the match between Pulgyo (佛敎 - Buddhist) and Hanyang (漢陽), a dispute during the game caused a delay of several minutes. The Hanyang team requested a 15-minute extension to replay. However, the organizers and the Pulgyo side refused consent, eventually agreeing to add 9 minutes (based on the disputed time related to the score). But the Hanyang team stubbornly insisted on 15 minutes. Amidst arguments, protests, and mediation, the sun had already set (日色이 己暮), leading to a situation of 'oars broken, boat sunk' (棹折船破格).
With things having come to this, the games could not proceed, daylight faded, the executives were bewildered and helpless (惶惶罔措), the players were agitated (울눅불눅), the audience demanded refunds for time and entrance fees (入場料督促), and both plainclothes and uniformed police officers mobilized (正私服警官出働), turning the venue into utter chaos (一大 修羅場). Then, one of the organizers' executives, Wŏn Tal-ho (元達鎬), announced the postponement, the donation of the day's entrance fees to charity (公益寄付), and free admission for the next opening day, thus declaring the event closed with these few brief points.
Late into that night, the organizers reportedly held a meeting, decided that the executives would resign en masse out of responsibility (責任), and resolved to hold the tournament again once new executives emerged.
Is resigning after taking responsibility all there is to it? Resignation (辭免) is not the solution (能事). Where will the responsibility for the original principles and assertions be directed? Is it enough just to resign? Where is such a spineless (無骨子) act acceptable?

This should be a roughly accurate account of the whole affair. Whatever the public eye (公眼) may see, this is what I saw and what I heard from those involved.
Now then, based on the facts above, one can judge for oneself who is to blame and where the black marks (黑点) lie. However, since I've started writing, I will offer a critique (一評), though I don't know if it's reckless judgment (妄斷). <62>

Why didn't the organizers, having established such principles, exert thorough effort when examining player eligibility? Wasn't it a major mistake to muddle through formally (형식으로 어믈어믈하고만)? To be thorough, shouldn't committee members have been dispatched (委往) to investigate even the school registers and conduct more rigorous checks with all related parties? (Even if they absolutely trusted the principals' certifications, it was the organizers' responsibility). Despite this, what kind of maneuvering (酬酌) was it to gather related parties just before the tournament for a vote to identify ineligible players? Isn't that, beyond the organizers' irresponsibility, a kind of childish game (兒戱)? Furthermore, once the tournament started, shouldn't they have proceeded decisively (一刀兩斷格) according to the established principles and organization? Why did the executives scatter (4散5裂), leaving the headquarters tent (幕內) filled with police officers (巡査), while turning the playing field (競技場裏) into a drill ground (散操場)? Was the authority (氣勢) of the Sports Association (軆育會) so weak? Although they undoubtedly exerted considerable effort and experienced unprecedented headaches, to us, they looked like spineless individuals. It's true that the chairman, Ko Wŏn-hun (高元勳), was away on a trip (to Inch'ŏn (仁川) regarding the Posŏng Chŏnmun School (普專校) issue), but how could the spectators understand this, and how could the person in charge be so negligent (踈忽) after gathering the robust youth (健兒) of all Korea? (Other executives, of course, share the same responsibility). Let that be as it may.
Regarding the disgraceful behavior (醜態) among the participating teams – that is truly a matter of great regret, not just for the sports world of Korea, but for the educational world (敎育界) of Korea. No, more than regret, it is a major current issue requiring a great purge (一大 廓淸) for the sake of the sports and educational worlds.
How could the authorities (當局者) of middle schools, who guide and manage (敎導 支配) thousands of robust young students, clearly knowing the tournament regulation required over one year of enrollment, witnessing the strict player screening process, and being fully aware that the school principal's certification was taken with absolute trust (絶大 信用) – did they have no conscience (양심)? No sense of shame (체면)? Did they think their neighbors had no eyes or ears, that they were all fools? Knowing full well the requirement of over one year's enrollment, why did they provide false certifications for ineligible students, allow them to participate, ultimately sully the tournament, and bring shame upon their own faces, their schools, and tens of thousands of innocent students, preventing them from holding their heads high? Since the public eye (萬人의 公眼) exists and blunt public opinion (萬人의 直舌) exists, I won't say more, but isn't recommending one's own school's players and then confessing one's own school's ineligibility truly something that should not be heard by others (不可使聞於他人)?
Note: Sports Association Executives (軆育會幹部): Chairman Ko Wŏn-hun (高元勳), Director Im Kyŏng-jae (任璟宰), Directors Chŏng Tae-hyŏn (鄭大鉉), Hyŏn Sang-yun (玄相允), Yi Chung-hwa (李重華), Ŏm Chu-ik (嚴柱益), Sŏ Pyŏng-hŭi (徐丙羲), Wŏn Tal-ho (元達鎬), Hŏ Sŏng (許城).<63>

**Summary**

The article reports on the chaotic collapse of the 4th All-Korea Football Tournament in December 1923, organized by the Chosŏn Sports Association. Scheduled for three days at Hwimun Higher Common School in Kyŏngsŏng, the tournament descended into turmoil due to widespread issues with ineligible players. Despite eligibility rules requiring specific enrollment periods certified by school principals or team leaders, accusations and eventual confessions of fielding ineligible players led to protests, match disruptions, team expulsions (Hwimun, Sungsil, Osan), and intense arguments, culminating in the organizers postponing the event indefinitely amidst public anger and police presence. The reporter criticizes both the organizers for lax enforcement and participating schools (particularly middle schools) for knowingly submitting false certifications, calling it a disgrace to Korean sports and education.

This article is historically significant as it provides a raw, contemporary account of organizational failures and ethical breaches within the nascent Korean sports scene during the colonial period. It highlights the intense competition and perhaps desperation for victory among schools, leading even respected educational institutions to cheat. The detailed narrative of protests, investigations (including checking school registers), and the ultimate breakdown reveals the challenges faced by Korean organizations like the Chosŏn Sports Association in establishing fair play and authority under colonial constraints. The mention of specific schools, individuals, and the public reaction offers valuable social history insights into colonial Seoul, youth activities, and the tensions surrounding institutional integrity.

全朝鮮蹴球大會는 -왜 흐지부지 하고 말엇는가-
						一記者
年中行事가티 1年 1次 開催되는 朝鮮軆育會主催의 제 4회 全朝鮮蹴球大會는 去 12월 21일부터 仝3일까지 3일 기한으로써 京城徽文高等普通學校 「그라운드」에서 열니엿다가 中間에 不正選手問題로 波瀾 又 波瀾을 生起하다가 結局 大會는 瓦解에 歸하고 無期延期의 終幕을 告하게 된 것은 세상이 다- 알뿐 아니라 세상이 一大 恨事로 녁이는 바어니와 그만한 대회 朝鮮의 最高 骨髓라 할만한 적어도 22개의 全鮮 小學團 中學團 靑年團으로써 조직된 그만한 대회로서 또는 今番이 처음이 안이고 적어도 3, 4차 경험을 가진 그만한 대회로서 뿐만 안이라 主催惻이 그 만콤 정중한 강령을 선언하고 叅加側이 그 만콤 공정한 「템」을 주장하든 그 대회가 왜 중간에 醜態雜狀이 連日 露出하다가 결국 흐지부지 瓦鮮되고 운동계 안이 일반사회에 一大 恨事를 남기고 마럿는가. 罪- 누게 잇고 醜- 어대 잇슴은 장차 알려니와 爲先 대회의 顚末부터 본 바 드른 바에 의하야 대략 쓰고 보자.

문제의 초점은 무엇보다도 『不正選手』 그것이엿다. 選手資格問題를 兩便 共히 그 만콤 嚴重 且 公正히 한다든 것이 엇지하야 不正 2字가 폭로되야 결국 대회가 修羅化가 되얏는가. 암으리 생각하야도 의문이 안인가. 대회의 와해도 사실이 사실이닛가 不正이 잇기도 사실은 사실이겟다. (自白側도 잇스닛가)
그러한데 主催側의 발표한 강령중 選手資格에 관한 一節을 보면 대회에 참가할 選手의 資格은 『靑年團』은 該團在籍 3個月以上, 中學團 及 小學團(普通學校程度 學校에 한함)은 該校在籍 1個年 以上됨을 當該會長 又는 교장의 증명이 有함을 要함』이라 하얏다. 靑年團은 在籍 3個月 以上 中學團 及 小學團은 在籍 1個年 以上으로 該團長 又는 該校長의 증명이 有한 者에 選手資格이 有하다고 主催側이 明言하야스닛가. 毋論 그만한 手續下에서 選手를 加入식켜슬 것이요 又는 叅加 各 團도 그만한 條件 下에서 참가하야슬 것이다. 더구나 該團長 該校長은 該團의 대표는 고사하고 일반사회의 推尊을 밧을 만한 상당한 지위 또는 신용이 잇는 신분이닛가 這間에는 何如한 허위가 업슬 것이 사실이겟다.
그런데 불구하고 不正이 폭로된 것은 웬일이냐. 主催側의 잘못 調査이냐 當該 代表의 詐欺手段이냐 罪는 분명히 엇던 한 편에 잇다.
「의심 만흔 곳에 범이 난다」고 본래부터 主催側 叅加側 共히 選手資格에 대한 의심이 잇든 모양이다.
그래서 대회전 19일 오후에 主催側 幹部 及 叅加側 監督者가 모히여 選手資格 問題로 一場會議를 開하야 토론이 중첩하다가 各自 投票로 不正者 摘發에 까지 至하얏다 한다. 開票를 하고 보니 某團의 某는 不正選手 某校의 某는 不資格選手 各自 指摘에 不正者 無한 團이 別無하얏든 모양이다. 左之右之 두루 법석을 치다가 결국은 該團長 及 校長의 증명을 절대 신임하자는 것으로 일치를 決하얏다 한다. (當時 京城 中學團 選手 中 張某가 不正타 하야 該校長이 該選手의 不叅을 明言하얏다는 말도 잇다)
이리하야 各自 不正의 懷疑를 感하면서도 彌縫的 형식하에서 대회는 迫하얏다.
大會 第一日 卽 21일의 오전은 各 小學團 預選인바 이는 別問題가 업시 원만히 종료되얏다. 仝오후 부터는 中學團 預選이 시작되얏다. 아직 폭발의 기미가 업섯다. 그러나 不正團 자체에서는 거의 가슴이 조박조박하야슬 것이요. 부정을 点知하는 엇던 團에서는 불평이 울눅불눅하야 噴口의 微烟을 폴폴 날니고 이섯다.
小學團은 毋論 中學團도 五山 對 崇實 永生 對 徽文이 조마조마한 중에서 이럭저럭 맛치고 이번 순서로는 光成 對 中央이엿는데 악가부터 微烟이 폴폴 날니든 中央便에서는 그만 對便不正의 기함을 탁 배터 노앗다. 즉 光成軍에는 不正選手가 5人이니 3인이니 소리가 連해나며 (사실은 1인인데 그는 光成校 4년제를 졸업하고 금년 봄에 다시 五學年에 入學 云) 該不正團과 應戰치 안느다는 中央軍은 정식으로 ＜60＞ 主催側에 항의를 걸어섯다. 그래서 光成 對 中央戰은 문제 해결까지 次期로 넘기고 培材 對 永明戰으로서 第一日은 終幕을 告하얏다.
第一日부터 不正問題가 폭로되자 主催側 幹部는 毋論 關係 各 團, 一般 觀覽者까지도 모다 눈이 휘둥그래지며 각기 숙은숙은 하게 되얏다. 主催側은 밤을 도아 幹部會議, 叅加側은 눈을 비벼가며 對便의 不正探摘으로 21日夜는 공기가 퍽 긴장하얏든 터이다.
第二日이다. 光成 對 中央戰은 光成軍이 不正選手 1명을 제외하고 10인 선수로 中央과 대하게 되야 결국 光成이 敗하게 되얏다. 이에 사방에서 흐믈흐믈하든 噴火口는 一時에 폭발이 되게 되얏다. 光成은 崇實의 不正 1명을 摘示하야 主催側에 항의하고 崇實側은 五山의 不正 五山은 徽文의 不正을- 이리하야 대회는 결국 波瀾場이 되고 叅加 不正團側은 五獸不働格이 되야 一大 怪怪罔測한 醜雜狀을 이루게 되얏다. 一便 主催側에서 幹部會議을 열며 一便 非不正團만 拔出하야 경기를 하며 또 一便 自團의 변명 또 一便 自團 謝過 등 別別 滑劇이 연출되얏다.
主催側은 幹部會議 또는 各不正團의 學籍 及 關係者의 증명에 의하야 徽文 及 崇實에 대하야 퇴장 명령을 下하얏다.
理由. 徽文選手 中 張世遠은 該校 學籍簿를 조사한 결과- 재적 1개년 중 28일이 부족이니 대회의 강령에 의하야 퇴장을 명하고 (該校長으로 自過 自退說도 有) 崇實에는 選手 張炳善이가 3개년이나 崇實에 재학하얏스나 금년 秋期(9월부터 11월까지) 붜 光成學校에 3개월이나 재적하얏다고 光成學校 敎師(大會의 審判員의 1人) 李錫贊氏 증명으로 퇴장을 命하얏다.
이리하고 보니 대회의 꼴이 무엇이랴. 翌日에 와서 五山도 亦 自己 不正을 自白하고 퇴장해 버렷다. 이만하면 半身不遂의 대회나마 일단락을 告한 듯 하나 그러나 一大 波瀾이 終乃 起伏을 重出하니 그는 卽 崇實側의 抗議 그것이다.
제2일 오후에 퇴장 선언을 바든 崇實軍은 學校 名譽上 選手 資格上 퇴장의 억울을 주장하고 氣勢萬丈하게 들고 일어서서 一便 主催側에 항의를 提하며 一便 學校 當局者에게 증명서류와 共히 來證을 電請하야 제2일로 제3일 즉 대회가 瓦解되기까지 强硬히 대항하얏다. 이제 兩便 主張의 요점을 드르면 ＜61＞ 崇實便의 主張은
「崇實校의 不正選手라 지명된 張炳善은 3년이나 崇實中學校에 재적한 학생으로 금년 9월 中旬부터 11월 中旬까지 약 3개월간 결석은 하얏스나 퇴학도 안이요 제적도 안이요 月謝金까지 계속 납입하얏고 또한 3개월이나 無故欠席한데 대하야 當者 及 父兄 證人의 사과로써 校員會議에서 하등의 處罰도 업시 계속 재적자로 확인한 學校長의 證明 及 其他 文籍까지 完在하니 何로써 不正을 말하는가 중간에 光成 在籍은 사실이라 하나 崇實에서는 退學 轉學 再入學에 대한 하등 수속이 업섯스니 張炳善은 분명히 3년 在籍이라』하고.
主催便의 주장은
「대회의 강령에 1년 이상 재적자를 要한 것은 종래 운동계의 弊風 즉 選手爭奪을 예방하는 一例로 그리한 것인데 문제의 張炳善은 崇實校의 主張은 그러하나 사실에 잇서서 此校 彼校로 任去來한 것이 사실이니 대회의 강령에 遠反이라」하고 결국 崇實의 항의를 不聽하얏다. 이리하야 제3일의 夕紅이 仁王山上에 반쯤 넘을 때까지 左之右之하다기 맛츰내 자연의 黑幕이 來襲함과 동시에 대회도 風浪 중에 까라안고 말앗다.
이뿐이랴 제3일 靑年團 제2회 예선 중 佛敎 對 漢陽戰 중에 경기 중 다소 紛爭事로 幾分間 遲延된 事가 有하야 漢陽軍으로서 15분을 연장하야 다시 試戰을 요구하얏다. 그러나 主催側 及 佛敎側은 聽許를 不肯하다가 결국 9분간을 (스코아에 의한 紛爭時間이 9분) 더해 주기로 하얏다. 그러나 漢陽軍은 굿게 15분을 주장하야 이렁저렁 주장, 항의, 중재 중에서 日色이 己暮하니 棹折船破格이 되고 말앗다.
이리 되고 보니 경기는 못되고 日色은 저믈고 幹部는 惶惶罔措 選手는 울눅불눅 관중은 時間 及 入場料督促 正私服警官出働 一大 修羅場이 되자 主催側 幹部 一人 元達鎬군으로부터 延期宣言, 當日入場料公益寄付, 次期開會日無料公開 등 간단한 멧 개 條로써 閉場을 선언을 하고 말앗다.
當日 夜深토록 主催側에서는 회의를 開하고 責任上 幹部가 總辭職을 하고 新幹部의 出現을 待하야 再次 大會를 공개하기로 決하얏다 한다.
責任지고 사면만 하면 그뿐일가 辭免이 能事가 안이다. 본래의 主義 主張은 어대다가 책임을 보낼가 辭免만 하면 그만이다. 그런 無骨子한 일이 어대 잇는가.

이만하면 그의 顚末이 대체로 비슷하게 씨인 줄 안다. 일반 公眼은 엇던지 나는 이러케 보고 또 當務者에게 이러케 드럿다.
자 그러면 以上 事實로써 罪- 누게 잇고 黑点이 어대 잇는 것을 自斷할 수 잇다. 그러나 쓰던 끗이니 妄斷인지는 모르나 一評을 下하려 한다. ＜62＞

主催側에서 그의 강령은 그러케 하고 選手權을 審査할 때에 철저한 노력을 왜 드리지 안엇는가. 형식으로 어믈어믈하고만 것은 큰 실수가 안인가. 철저히 하랴면 委員이 委往하야 學籍까지 조사하고 關係 各 方面에도 좀더 엄밀한 조사를 요할 것이 안인가 (該校長의 증명을 절대 신용하겟지만 主催者의 책임으로) 그런데 불구하고 대회를 압해 두고 관계자를 모아 不正者 摘出의 투표가 무슨 酬酌이냐 그것이 主催者 無責任보다도 一種 兒戱의 노름이 안이냐. 그리고 대회를 시작한 바에는 그 강령 또는 그 조직된 바에 의하야 一刀兩斷格으로 대회의 주장대로 뻑뻑 진행할 것인데 왜 간부는 4散5裂하야 본부의 幕內에는 巡査로 充塡하야 노코 競技場裏는 散操場을 만드럿는가 軆育會의 氣勢가 그리도 미약하든가. 毋論 相當한 노력과 다시 맛보지 못할 두통도 격겨스리라마는 우리 보기에는 뼈하나 업는 자들 가티 보엿다. 회장된 高元勳君이 어대 여행(普專校 問題로 仁川行)을 作하얏든 것은 사실이나 관중이 엇지 그를 양해하며 또 全朝鮮 靑年 健兒를 모아놋코 책임자가 엇지 그러케 踈忽에 走하야슬가 (他 幹部도 毋論 同一責任者이지만) 그는 그러타 하고
叅加 各團 中 醜態- 그것이야말로 朝鮮의 체육계를 위함보다 朝鮮의 敎育界를 위하야 一大 恨事이다. 안이 恨事보다 軆育界 又는 敎育界를 위하야 一大 廓淸을 要할 現下의 大問題이다.
적어도 數千 數百 靑年健兒를 敎導 支配하는 中學校의 當局者로서 대회의 강령이 1개년 이상 在籍者로 한함을 분명히 知하면서도 選手審査를 그처럼 엄중히 하는 그 광경을 보면서도 學校長의 증명을 絶大 信用을 確知하면서도 양심도 업든가 체면도 업든가 이웃은 눈이 업고 귀가 업는 바보뿐으로 알엇든가. 在籍 1년 이상을 분명히 알면서 왜 不 及 者임을 분명히 알고도 거짓 증명하야 참가를 식켜놋코 결국 대회에도 똥칠을 하고 제 얼굴 제 學校 無罪한 數萬 學生에게까지 얼굴을 못펴게 하얏는가. 萬人의 公眼이 잇고 萬人의 直舌이 이스닛가 더 말은 안이한다마는 自校의 선수를 自薦하고 自校의 不正을 자백한 것이야말로 不可使聞於他人이 안이랴.
