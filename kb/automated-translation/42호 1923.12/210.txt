A Tragic and Heroic Brief History of General Min

Anyone would likely remember the righteous army leader Min Kŭn-ho (閔肯鎬) who rose up in Wŏnju during the disbandment of the Korean army in the Chŏngmi year (1907). He was originally from Pukch'ŏng, South Hamgyŏng Province. He served as a First Lieutenant (正校 - chŏnggyo) in the Kosŏng Garrison (鎭衛隊 - chinwidae), and when the Kosŏng unit was abolished and merged into the Wŏnju Garrison, he was also transferred to Wŏnju. He was an upright man of integrity and a passionate soldier with principles. At that time, the Korean military was entirely corrupt, and regardless of whether they were enlisted soldiers or officers, they indulged day and night in drinking, womanizing, and gambling. However, Mr. Min, being particularly strict in nature and firmly upholding the military spirit, did not set foot in taverns or brothels. Not only Mr. Min's subordinates but even his superiors were always wary (忌憚) of him. Having spent two years (二個의 星霜) like this in the Wŏnju camp, he finally encountered the occasion of the army disbandment in the 6th lunar month of the Chŏngmi year. When the disbandment order came down from the military headquarters, Japanese soldiers stationed in Kyŏngsŏng and Ch'ungju were already mobilizing to launch a surprise attack on the Wŏnju camp and seize its weapons. At that time, the Wŏnju force consisted of over 800 sturdy men, and there were also numerous officers including a Lieutenant Colonel (參領 - ch'amnyŏng). However, none dared to voice even a single word of dissent, merely looking at each other with faces pale as ash (如土). At this moment, Mr. Min stepped forward boldly, spoke with tragic and passionate indignation, and requested his superiors to fight a decisive battle with their backs to the wall (背城一戰). However, the cowardly and disloyal superiors refused, stating that they could not act recklessly (妄動) due to the royal command. Thereupon, Mr. Min's fury pierced the heavens. Drawing the long sword (長釰) from his waist (腰下), he reprimanded them, saying, "Not only is it said that 'When a general is in the field, he may disobey the ruler's command' (將在外에 君命은 有所不受), but moreover, it is known even to children on the street that the Emperor (大君主), unable to withstand foreign coercion, issued this extraordinary disbandment order. You, as officers, have received the nation's grace for years, yet now, at this critical juncture of survival or destruction, you sit idly awaiting capture (束手就縛). This makes you traitors to the nation!" He then commanded the entire army, and none dared disobey. Thus, on the 27th day of the 6th lunar month, he resolutely raised the banner of righteousness (義旗), becoming the righteous army commander himself, and sent out calls to arms (傳檄) in all directions. Mr. Min remained encamped in Wŏnju for three days before moving his camp to the neighboring town of Yŏngwŏl. This was because Wŏnju, being exposed to attack from all four sides (四面受敵之地), had terrain unfavorable for defense, and also out of consideration that fighting in Wŏnju would bring tragic disaster (慘禍) upon the people of Wŏnju. Thereafter, Mr. Min dispatched troops to areas like Ch'ungju and Chech'ŏn, engaging in numerous battles with Japanese soldiers and achieving some success. However, his soldiers were essentially an undisciplined mob (烏合) with little training, and furthermore, their weaponry, provisions, and manpower were weak. Consequently, even for Mr. Min, who was courageous and skilled in military tactics, it was difficult to maintain his position for long. After suffering a defeat (敗刱) in Chech'ŏn,<104> he retreated again to Yŏngwŏl, planning to regroup and make a comeback (捲土重來). At that time, Hong U-sŏk (洪祐晳), the Royal Emissary (宣諭使 - sŏnyusa) for Kangwŏn Province, tried various ways to persuade Mr. Min to surrender (歸化), but Mr. Min resolutely refused to listen. Along with several dozen subordinates, he lay hidden in Wŏrhyŏn (月峴) (formerly Tŭngjahyŏn, Wŏnju County), Suju-myŏn, Yŏngwŏl County, secretly watching for an opportune moment (潛窺). Alas, the times were against him (時不利兮奈若何리오)! The Taegu police unit detected this, launched a surprise attack under the cover of darkness, set fire to civilian houses, and fired indiscriminately. As matters reached this point, Mr. Min made his decision. Stepping out before the village, he shouted loudly, "Min Kŭn-ho is here! Do not kill innocent civilians!" and voluntarily submitted to capture (自進就縛). Had he not been a man of righteous spirit, Mr. Min could have fled at this time solely for his own life, disregarding the massacre of numerous villagers. Mr. Min was captured by the police unit and endured immense suffering and humiliation in Kakrimni. While he was undergoing this, Mr. Min's subordinates attacked by night in an attempt to rescue him, resulting in numerous casualties. Mr. Min himself was also killed in the chaotic fighting. Alas! This was the 28th day of the first lunar month of the Musin year (1908). From then on, the Wŏnju garrison could sleep soundly (高枕安眠), and the Taegu police unit received a large reward. However, loyalty and righteousness (義肝忠膽) can move even wood and stone. The Wŏnju garrison, praising Mr. Min's righteousness, prepared a coffin (棺槨) and burial clothes (繡衣) and, in consultation with the local people, gave him a respectful burial outside the North Gate (北門外) (present-day Numunni, Wŏnju-myŏn). At that time, among the people in Wŏnju city, regardless of gender or age, there was no one who did not shed tears (揮淚). Mr. Min's funeral bier (靈輿) was carried by young men who had formerly been his subordinates, volunteering for the task. His beloved concubine (氏名 未詳 - name unknown), although originally from the entertainment world (花柳界), also remained faithful (節) to his memory for three years. Mr. Min's grave (遺宅) is still maintained to this day by Mr. An Yun-ok (安允玉), a prominent figure (名望家) in Wŏnju.<105>

**Summary**

This article recounts the story of Min Kŭn-ho, a Korean army officer from Pukch'ŏng who served in Wŏnju. Characterized as upright and principled, he vehemently opposed the forced disbandment of the Korean army by Japanese forces in 1907. When his superiors passively accepted the order, Min denounced them, rallied soldiers, and became a righteous army (ŭibyŏng) commander. He fought several battles against the Japanese but was eventually forced to retreat and hide. He was captured after sacrificing himself to prevent harm to villagers during a Japanese raid and was killed in early 1908 during a failed rescue attempt by his men. He was given a respectful burial by the local Wŏnju garrison and populace. For historians, the article offers a contemporary (1923) Korean perspective on the 1907 army disbandment, portraying Min Kŭn-ho as a national hero resisting Japanese aggression and internal collaborators. It provides details on ŭibyŏng activities, Japanese suppression tactics (including attacks on civilians), and the complex reactions among Koreans, including the respect shown to Min even after his death by former enemies and the local community.

悲絶壯絶한 閔大將의 畧史
丁未년 朝鮮군대 해산 時에 原州에서 이러난 의병 대장 閔肯鎬라 하면 누구던지 대개 기억할 것이다. 그는 원래 咸鏡南道 北靑 사람이엿다. 육군 正校로 高城 鎭衛隊에 봉직하얏다가 而己高城隊가 폐지되야 原州 鎭衛隊에 合軍하게 됨애 그도 또한 原州로 전근하얏다. 그는 爲人이 강직하고 志槪가 잇는 慷慨의 군인이다. 당시 韓國의 군대가 모도 부패하야 병졸과 위관을 막론하고 日夜酒色 도박 등을 일삼되 특히 閔氏는 성질이 엄격하고 군대의 기풍을 確守하야 酒肆靑樓에 족적을 入치 안이하니 閔氏의 부하는 물론이고 그의 상관이라도 항상 忌憚하얏섯다. 如斯히 原州營에서 2개의 星霜을 지내다가 마참 丁未년 6월에 군대 해산하는 期會를 당하얏다. 군부에서 해산 명령이 下하자 京城, 忠州에 잇는 日兵은 原州營을 暗襲하야 軍器를 占奪하랴고 출동한 중이엿다. 其時 原州의 군대는 800여 健兒가 잇고 또 叅領이하 다수의 將官이 잇섯다. 그러나 감히 一言의 이의 하나를 하는 자가 업고 다만 안색이 如土하야 互相顧眄할 뿐이엿다. 이때 閔氏는 당당이 出斑하야 悲憤慷慨의 言論을 하고 상관에게 背城一戰하기를 원하얏다. 그려나 無勇無義한 상관들은 君命이 잇스니 妄動치 못한다고 거절하얏다. 이에 閔氏는 憤氣가 天을 衝하야 腰下의 長釰을 拔하고 질책 曰 將在外에 君命은 有所不受일 뿐 안이라 況且 大君主가 外人 협박을 익이지 못하야 非常의 해산령을 下하신 것은 路上小兒가 다 아는 바이라. 君等이 將官으로 屢歲國恩을 受하다가 危急存亡의 秋에 際하야 束手就縛을 坐待하니 此는 國賊이라 하고 一軍을 호령하니 감히 應從치 안이하는 자가 업섯다. 乃 6월 27일에 蹶然이 義旗를 擧하야 스사로 의병 대장이 되고 사방에 傳檄하얏다. 閔氏는 原州에서 3일을 留陣하다가 隣邑 寧越로 移陣하얏스니 이것은 원래 原州가 四面受敵之地인 故로 지세가 방어에 불리하고 또한 原州에서 교전하면 原州人民이 慘禍를 당할 것을 고려한 것이다. 其後 閔氏는 忠州 堤川 等地로 출병하야 日兵과 누차 교전하야 다소의 功을 成햇스나 원래 훈련이 젹은 烏合의 병졸이오 且 軍器, 兵糧, 兵力이 미약하고 본 즉 비록 勇壯하고 用兵의 기능이 잇는 閔氏라도 其勢를 長久히 유지키 難하얏다. 堤川에서＜104＞ 敗刱한 후 다시 寧越로 퇴진하야 捲土重來를 계획하얏다. 其時 江原道 宣諭使 洪祐晳은 閔씨의 歸化하기를 백방으로 권유하얏스되 閔씨는 斷不聽從하고 부하 수십인과 가티 寧越郡 水周面 月峴(舊 原州郡 登子峴)에 隱伏하야 시기를 潛窺하고 잇섯다. 時不利兮奈若何리오. 대구경찰대는 此를 탐지하고 暗中來襲하야 민가에 放火하고 亂銃을 射하얏다. 事가 此에 至함매 閔씨는 志를 決하고 村前에 돌출하야 大聲曰 閔肯鎬가 이에 잇스니 無辜한 양민을 살해치 말나 하고 自進就縛하얏다. 義氣의 남자가 안일 것 가트면 이 때 閔씨는 자기 생명만 위하야 도주하고 다수한 촌민의 참해를 不顧하얏슬 것이다. 閔씨는 경찰대에 포박되야 覺林里에서 무한한 고욕을 당하는 중에 閔씨의 부하병은 氏를 구하랴고 乘夜來襲하다가 다수한 사상이 나고 氏도 또한 亂軍 중에서 被害하니 嗚呼- 時는 戊申 정월 이십팔일이다. 原州수비대는 이로부터 高枕安眠하고 대구경찰대는 大賞을 受하얏다. 그러나 義肝忠膽은 목석이라도 다 감동하는 바이라. 原州수비대는 閔씨의 義를 稱賞하야 棺槨과 繡衣를 具하고 當地人民과 상의하야 北門 외(今 原州面 樓門里)에 厚葬하니 其時 原州城 중의 인민은 남녀아동을 막론하고 揮淚치 안이한 자가 無하얏고 氏의 靈輿는 氏의 元部下兵으로 잇던 壯丁이 지원하야 호송하얏다. 氏의 애첩은(氏名 未詳) 원래 화류계 출신이지만 亦 氏를 위하야 3년간 節을 守하고 氏의 유택은 지금까지 原州의 名望家 安允玉씨가 수호한다.＜105＞
