溟州懷古
						冷齋 柳惠風
鷄林眞骨大王親, 九雉分供左海濱. 最憶如花池上女, 魚書聊寄遠遊人.＜70＞

Kerim's true-bone royal kin,
Nine pheasants were offered on the eastern shore.
Most memorable is the girl by the pond, like a flower,
Sending a fish-letter to the distant traveler. <70>

**Summary**

This is a short, four-line classical Chinese poem (Hansi) reflecting nostalgically on Myŏngju (an old name for the Kangnŭng area). It references a royal figure from Silla (Kerim) of the "true bone" rank, an offering made on Korea's east coast, and recalls a beautiful girl sending a letter to someone far away. From a historical perspective, the poem's publication in *Kaebyŏk*, a significant Korean cultural and nationalist magazine during the Japanese colonial period, is noteworthy. It demonstrates the continued use of traditional literary forms and recalling Korea's pre-colonial history (Silla dynasty) as a means of preserving cultural identity and perhaps expressing subtle longing for a lost past during a time of foreign rule.
