**Body Text Translation**
To the Doubters
						Kim Tong-myŏng

Gracious friends!
Towards me, you have said
I am a deceiver,
And called me a heinous betrayer (背信者), haven't you? And you still do.
To that, I will not answer.
Only, when the spring morning grows late outside the window (窓),
And the azaleas on the East Hill (東山) are red,
Go there, please.
Upon the trembling green leaves and crimson petals (花瓣),
You will meet my heart lying fallen there.

Affectionate (情) friends!
Towards me, you have said
I am one who knows no fidelity (信義),
And called me a detestable hypocrite (僞善者), haven't you? And you still do.
To that, I will not answer.
Only, when the wind passes through the willow trees<144>
And the rushing rapids cry out loud,
Go there, please.
Within the flowing ripples, in the embrace of the gentle breeze (微風),
You will see my tears contained there.

Thoughtful, gracious friends!
Towards me, you have said
I am one without blood and tears,
And even called me an ugly (醜) and fearsome devil (惡魔), haven't you? And you still do.
To that, I will not answer.
Only, when the leaves turn red in the frost,
And the cries of the wild geese flock are high in the autumn sky,
Go beneath the moon, please.
Among the crumbling leaves, within the chilly moonlight,
You will find my song permeating.<145>
<144-145>

**Summary**

This poem by Kim Tong-myŏng addresses friends, referred to as "doubters," who have accused the speaker of being a deceiver, betrayer, hypocrite, and even a heartless "devil." Instead of defending themselves directly against these harsh accusations, the speaker consistently refuses to answer. They instead direct the doubters to observe specific scenes in nature—spring azaleas, flowing streams in summer, and moonlit autumn landscapes—stating that within these natural elements, the doubters will find the speaker's true heart, tears, and song. The poem suggests that the speaker's true self and emotions are embedded in nature, perhaps implying they are beyond simple human judgment or verbal explanation.

From the perspective of Korean colonial history, this poem, published in *Kaebyŏk* in 1923, is interesting. The accusations of betrayal and deceit directed at the speaker might reflect the internal conflicts, suspicions, and pressures faced by Korean intellectuals and activists under Japanese rule. The speaker's retreat into nature as the repository of their true feelings could symbolize a form of passive resistance, a search for authenticity away from the compromising social/political sphere, or an expression of alienation felt by those navigating the difficult ethical terrain of the colonial period. Historians might see this as evidence of the psychological burden and coping mechanisms employed by individuals facing intense scrutiny and potential persecution, where direct self-defense was either futile or dangerous.

						金東鳴
고마운 벗들이여!
그대들은 나를 향하야
속엿튼 놈이라 하며
凶惡한 背信者라고 하엿지오 그리고 또 하지오
거긔에 나는 대답지 안켓나이다
오직 窓 밧게 봄아츰이 늣고
東山에 진달내꼿이 붉거던
그리로 가소서
흔들리는 푸른닙 새빨간 花瓣 우에
넘어저 잇는 내 마음을 만나오리다.

情답운 벗들이여!
그대들은 나를 향하야
信義를 모르는 놈이라 하며
可憎한 僞善者라고 하엿지오 그리고 또 하지오
거긔에 나는 대답지 안켓나이다
오직 실버드나무에 바람이 지나고＜144＞
潳潳한 여을이 목노아 울거던
그리로 가소서
흐르는 물결 微風의 품 속에
담겨 잇는 내 눈물을 보오리다.

살틀한 고마운 벗들이여!
그대들은 나를 향하야
픠와 눈믈이 업는 놈이라 하며
醜하고 무서운 惡魔라고까지 하엿지오 그리고 또 하지오
거긔에 나는 대답지 안켓나이다
오직 서리에 닙붉고
가을 한울에 떼기럭이의 우름이 놉거던
달 아래로 가소서
문허지는 닙 사늘한 달빗 속으로
슴여드는 내 노래를 차즈오리다.＜145＞
