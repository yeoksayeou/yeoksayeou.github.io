Northern Korean Youth
						Ch'ŏpkisaeng (T'u)

It was already some time ago. In Hamnam and Hambuk provinces, provincial residents' conferences (도민대회) were held, where important matters of the provinces were discussed. Though not necessarily following that example, in Hambuk, the Hambuk Youth Association Conference, hosted by the Hambuk Youth Association Federation, took place. To speak a bit more precisely, this conference was held from the night of October 20th within the Nanam Normal School (羅南普校), and with over 30 representatives from youth associations of various regions attending, it was the first large meeting of its kind seen in the Hambuk youth community. As everyone took their seats, Mr. Kim Tong-ŭn from the organizing side gave the opening remarks, followed by a roll call of the attending members. Then, a temporary chairman and secretary were elected, and they proceeded into discussions, addressing the agenda items. The overview includes matters concerning education, matters concerning industry, matters concerning customs and habits, matters concerning the development of youth associations, and various other issues discussed. Many were modern and appropriate for the times, making it not only very interesting but also the sole public discourse regarding Northern Korea. The matters resolved at this conference are as follows.

**Summary**

This article reports on the Hambuk Youth Association Conference held in Nanam in October 1923, the first large gathering of its kind for youth in Hamgyŏngbuk-to. Over 30 representatives discussed and passed resolutions on education, industry, hygiene, customs, youth group development, and administrative issues. Key demands included expanding Korean-language education, improving access to schools and resources, securing economic rights for local Koreans (especially regarding land and finance), promoting public health and modern hygiene, reforming social customs (women's status, marriage, clothing, lifestyle), strengthening youth organizations as autonomous bodies for popular movements, and demanding administrative reforms like elected local officials and respect for civil rights from authorities. The resolutions reflect a strong desire among Northern Korean youth in 1923 for self-improvement, cultural preservation, economic justice, and greater autonomy under colonial rule. Historians might find the detailed list of demands particularly valuable, revealing specific grievances and aspirations related to education (language, access, funding), economic control (land, finance, local industry), social modernization (women's roles, customs), and early political organization (youth groups, local governance) within the context of Japanese colonialism. The emphasis on practical local issues combined with broader nationalist concerns (language, Korean personnel, civil rights) provides insight into grassroots activism during this period.
