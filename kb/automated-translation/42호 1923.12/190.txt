關東雜詠
						靑吾

莊陵 (Changnŭng)

Changnŭng is in Nŭngdong-ri, Yŏngwŏl-myŏn, Yŏngwŏl-gun, and is indeed the royal tomb of King Tanjong. On the 24th day of the 10th month of the second year of King Sejo (1457, Chŏngch'uk year), King Tanjong passed away (陞遐). He was seventeen years old at the time. To this day, all the trees around the tomb point west. The *Chagyusa* (子規詞 - Song of the Cuckoo) was composed by King Tanjong himself, its words extremely sorrowful.
The ancient tomb's pines and cypresses still hold sorrow,
All facing Changan (Seoul), their branches full green.
Even old villagers know the events of the Chŏngch'uk year,
Still weeping as they sing the *Chagyusa*.

蘂城 (Yesŏng)

Yesŏng is at the eastern end of Kangnŭng-ŭp. Its circumference was 3,484 *ch'ŏk* (feet), but it is now all dilapidated, though the foundations still remain. The *Samguk Sagi* states that in the 16th year of King Namhae of Silla, a person from Pukmyŏng, while plowing a field, found the seal of the Ye king (穢王印) and presented it to the king.
The South River's great waters connect to the blue ocean,
Yesŏng's ruined fortress walls, grass and trees overgrown.
Looking back, pitiful is the cultivated land,
Where the ancient bronze seal is no longer seen today.

大滄 (Taech'ang)

Taech'ang is east of Kangnŭng-ŭp. It is commonly said to be the birthplace of the Changhae strongman (滄海力士).
Travelers point out Taech'ang village,
Wishing to mourn the strongman's soul in the west wind.
The hammering of iron is silent, heaven and earth grow old,
To whom can one discuss the vague events of the past?

寒松亭 (Hansongjŏng)

Hansongjŏng is located about ten *ri* east of Kangnŭng-ŭp, overlooking the East Sea to the east, with lush green pines. Beside the pavilion, there is the Yŏngch'ŏn stone mortar (*石臼), which is a place where the Silla immortal Sullang (述郞) used to roam. In the *akpu* (樂府 - collection of musical poems), there is the "Hansongjŏng 곡 (曲 - song)". It is said that this song was written on the bottom of a *kŭm* (琴 - zither), floated to Jiangnan (江南 - South China), but the people of Jiangnan could not understand its lyrics. During the reign of King Kwangjong of Koryŏ, a state official, Chang Chinsan (張晋山), was sent as an envoy to Jiangnan. The people of Jiangnan asked him about it. Chinsan composed a poem to explain it, saying, "The moon is white over Hansong on a cold night, waves linger on Kyŏngp'o in autumn, mournful cries come and go, a faithful lone seagull..." (月白寒松夜, 波殘鏡浦秋, 哀鳴來又去有信一沙鷗云云). The pavilion is now gone.
The moon white over Hansong, Kyŏngp'o in autumn,
Still, as ever, a faithful lone seagull.
Where is that song from yesteryear now?
Not seeing Envoy Chang makes me sorrowful.

烏竹軒 (Ojuk'ŏn)

Located ten *ri* north of Kangnŭng-ŭp in Chukch'ŏlli, Chŏngdong-myŏn (formerly named Pukp'yŏng), this is the old home site of the esteemed Kimyo scholar Sin Myŏnghwa (申命和 - Yulgok's maternal grandfather) and the birthplace of Master Yulgok Yi (栗谷李先生). In front of the courtyard, there is black bamboo (烏竹), hence the name Ojuk'ŏn. When the Master was born, his mother, Saimdang Sin Ssi (師妊堂申氏), dreamt of a black dragon giving birth, so the room was named Mongnyongsil (夢龍室 - Dream Dragon Room). It is currently owned by the Kwŏn clan (權氏 - descendants of Kwŏn Ch'ŏgyun 權處均, Sin Myŏnghwa's son-in-law), and the Kwŏn family still preserves Master Yulgok's handwritten draft of the *Kyŏngmong Yogyŏl* (擊蒙要訣 - Essentials for Dispelling Ignorance) and his favorite inkstone (硯石). (On the back of the inkstone is an inscription composed and written by King Chŏngjo (正廟御製御筆). The text reads: "The ink pool (涵池) symbolizes the hole in the stone, its virtue spreads widely; the dragon returns to its cave, clouds nourish the ink, the writing is here." (涵池象孔石, 普厥施龍歸洞, 雲滋墨文在茲))<100>
Chŏngdong's mountains and waters excel in Kwandong,
Producing the esteemed Sin and Yi.
Today the dragon has returned, the person long gone,
Black bamboo fills the courtyard, naturally stirring wind.

龍池 (Yongji)

Yongji is also east of the town. Legend has it that a dragon horse (龍馬) emerged from this pond. An ancestor of the Kangnŭng Kim clan (金氏) used to ride the dragon horse daily back and forth to Songdo (Kaesŏng). After the Kim ancestor died, the dragon horse also vanished into the air (空而去世), and people subsequently named the pond Yongji. The descendants of the Kim clan erected a commemorative monument.
The divine horse went to heaven, not to return,
Yongji's autumn grasses grow wild in heaps.
Pitiful is the single piece of the broken stele,
Weathered by the west wind, half-covered in green moss.

養魚池 (Yang'ŏji)

The old records of P'yŏngch'ang (平昌古記) state that during the time of King Chinp'yŏng of Silla, there was a man named Muwŏllang (無月郞) serving as an official in Kangnŭng. At that time, there was a woman named Yŏnhwanyŏ (蓮花女). They saw each other and their hearts united. When the Hwarang's term ended and he returned to the capital, he told the woman, "If we have a destined connection (宿緣), we shall become husband and wife." The woman's home was south of the Taech'ŏn stream, and north of her house was a deep pool. The woman often fed the fish there with rice. Among them was a pair of divine fish (神魚). When the woman's parents wanted to arrange her marriage, the woman spoke to the divine fish, saying, "Please deliver this letter to Muwŏllang." The fish seemed to respond, disappeared for three days, secretly traveled through the East Sea (東海), and reached Muwŏllang's fishing spot in Silla. The Hwarang caught the divine fish, which spat out the letter. The Hwarang immediately wrote a reply, gave it to the fish, and eventually welcomed the woman to be his wife. It is said that Yŏnhwabong (蓮花峰 - Lotus Flower Peak) below the Namdaech'ŏn stream today is that old pond. (Note: This story differs slightly from the one recorded in the *Yŏji Sŭngnam* (輿地勝覽), but since this record was written by Yi Kŏin (李居仁), the governor of Kangnŭng in the 7th year of King Myŏngjong (1552), it is also not without basis.)
Below Yŏnhwabong, the pond water brims full,
A school of swimming fish ripples the gentle waves.
Sometimes a beautiful woman comes to rinse silk,
Just like the message-sending lady of that day.

三日浦 (Samilp'o)

Samilp'o is located about ten *ri* north of Kosŏng-ŭp, one of the Eight Views of Kwandong (關東八景). Its circumference is about ten *ri*, the water color is clear and pure, perfectly like a bright mirror. Strange rocks and sheer cliffs reflect each other front and back. Water birds and sea birds fly interminglingly up and down. Outside are the wonders of the Thirty-Six Peaks, and inside is the famous pavilion of the Four Immortals (四仙亭) (the pavilion is now gone). This is where the Silla immortals Yŏngnang (永郞), Sullang (述郞), An'gi (安期), and Namsŏk (南石) and their followers roamed throughout Kwandong, reached this place, and forgot to return for three days, hence the name. On a small rock on the mountain south of the pavilion, there is a short stele, weathered with no characters visible, commonly called the Maitreya incense-burying stele (彌勒埋香碑). On the rock cliff to its west, the six characters "述郞徒南石行" (Sullang's follower Namsŏk walked here) are carved in red letters (丹書), traditionally said to be inscribed by the Four Immortals. There is also a rock inscribed by Yang Pongnae (楊蓬萊). South of the Sasiŏn Pavilion are Hwansŏnam (喚仙岩 - Immortal Calling Rock) and Yŏnggaegam (迎客巖 - Guest Welcoming Rock), both places of exceptional beauty.
Above the lake, rows of peaks, green upon green (六六 - thirty-six),
On the sand, returning crows, white in pairs.
Moving the boat towards Yŏnggaegam,
I compose a new poem, my brush like a lever (筆似杠).

洪川豊巖 (Hongch'ŏn P'ung'am)

P'ung'am is in Sŏsŏng-myŏn, Hongch'ŏn-gun. During the Kabo disturbance (甲午亂 - 1894), over a hundred followers of Ch'ŏndogyo (天道敎 - Religion of the Heavenly Way) were brutally massacred by Ch'unch'ŏn government troops. There are now several dozen large burial mounds.
Tragic and terrible P'ung'am-ri,
Dozens of desolate grave mounds.
A sorrowful wind blows through the wild trees, the air thick with killing aura on the mounds and ruins.
The Great Way (大道) is now said to prosper, its fragrant name not empty.
Coming here, I am overcome with grief,
Tears soaking the front of my robe.

鐵原 (Ch'ŏrwŏn)

Autumn day darkens in Ch'ŏlchu (Ch'ŏrwŏn),
A distant traveler stirs with fresh sorrow.
The old country's mountains and rivers remain,
The ruined castle's grass and trees are desolate.
Who would know this place of song and dance,
Has readily become a den for rabbits and foxes?
Past traces, no one asks about them,
Mountains empty, the mountain stream flows on its own. <101>
<100-101>

**Summary**

This article, "Miscellaneous Songs/Poems of Kwandong," is a travelogue by "Ch'ŏngo" describing various historical sites and scenic spots in the Kwandong (Gangwon) region of Korea in 1923. For each location—including royal tombs (Changnŭng), ancient fortresses (Yesŏng), pavilions (Hansongjŏng), birthplaces of famous scholars (Ojuk'ŏn), legendary ponds (Yongji, Yang'ŏji), scenic lakes (Samilp'o), and ruined cities (Ch'ŏrwŏn)—the author provides brief historical or legendary background information and concludes with a Hanśi (classical Chinese-style poem) reflecting on the site's significance or atmosphere. The piece mixes historical facts (references to Silla, Koryŏ, Chosŏn figures and texts) with local legends and personal poetic reflections. From a colonial history perspective, the article is interesting as it focuses entirely on Korean historical sites, figures (like King Tanjong, Yulgok Yi I), and legends, subtly emphasizing Korean heritage during Japanese rule. Furthermore, the section on Hongch'ŏn P'ung'am explicitly mentions the 1894 massacre of Ch'ŏndogyo followers by Korean government troops (associated with the Kabo reforms/Donghak Peasant Revolution), offering a poignant memory of internal conflict and suffering, a topic potentially sensitive yet recorded here. Historians might find the blend of cultural recollection, poetic sentiment, and the specific, somber remembrance of the P'ung'am massacre noteworthy for understanding cultural expression and historical memory in the 1920s.
