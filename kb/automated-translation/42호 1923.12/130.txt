Reminiscence of the Medicine Fortress/City
						Naengje Yu Hye-p'ung
Beyond Taegwallyŏng lies the Great Eastern Ocean,
The mountains and rivers of the Medicine Land are shaded by mulberry trees.
The old farmer in the fields cares not for matters of rise and fall,
Casually picking up ancient bronze coins between the furrows.<70>

**Summary**

The poem "Reminiscence of the Medicine Fortress/City" paints a tranquil picture of a rural landscape located beyond the Taegwallyŏng pass, near the "Great Eastern Ocean." It describes this "Medicine Land" as lush and peaceful, shaded by mulberry trees. The central image is an old farmer indifferent to historical changes ("matters of rise and fall"), who simply finds old bronze coins while working in the fields. From a colonial history perspective, the poem is interesting for its depiction of detachment from the political turmoil of the era (1923). It emphasizes the continuity of rural life and a sense of timelessness, contrasting with the significant societal shifts occurring under Japanese rule. Historians might find the poem reflective of a certain mindset focusing on local identity and endurance rather than overt political engagement or resistance.
