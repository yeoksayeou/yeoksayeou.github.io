Gangwon Province Market Song

At the Ch’unch’ŏn (春川) seedling market,
My shoes got wet, so I couldn’t see it.

At the Hongch’ŏn (洪川) ninety-thousand-ri market,
The road was too far, so I couldn’t see it.

At the higgledy-piggledy Yanggu (楊口) market,
There was too much *tanggwi* (當歸 - Angelica root), so I couldn’t see it.

At the one-foot-two-feet Samch’ŏk (三陟) market,
There was too much hemp cloth, so I couldn’t see it.

At the detail-exchanging Wŏnju (原州) market,
The price was too high, so I couldn’t see it.

At the rambling Hoengsŏng (橫城) market,
There was too much haggling, so I couldn’t see it.

At the persimmon-plentiful Kangnŭng (江陵) market,
The price was too low, so I couldn’t see it.

At the this-barrel-that-barrel T’ongch’ŏn (通川) market,
There was too much salted fish roe, so I couldn’t see it.

At the sparse Kosŏng (高城) market,
It was too boring, so I couldn’t see it.

At the this-stream-that-stream Ich’ŏn (伊川) market,
There were too many streams, so I couldn’t see it.

At the clankety-clank Ch’ŏrwŏn (鐵原) market,
The road was too muddy, so I couldn’t see it.

Over the pass at the Yŏngwŏl (寧越) market,
There was too much tobacco, so I couldn’t see it.

At the merry Kimhwa (金化) market,
It was too much fun, so I couldn’t see it.

At the winding Hoeyang (淮陽) market,
The road was too rough, so I couldn’t see it.

At the this-river-that-river P’yŏnggang (平康) market,
There was no river water, so I couldn’t see it.

Fell in love at the Chŏngsŏn (旌善) market,
There were too many prostitutes, so I couldn’t see it.

At the firewood-plentiful Hwach’ŏn (華川) market,
The road was blocked, so I couldn’t see it.

Selling provisions at the Yangyang (襄陽) market,
There was too much rice (), so I couldn’t see it.

Just arrived at the Inje (麟蹄) market,
Too busy with work, so I couldn’t see it.

At the bumpy Uljin (蔚珍) market,
I got too angry, so I couldn’t see it.

Tripe and intestines at the P’yŏngch’ang (平昌) market,
The drinking soup was too good, couldn’t see it!<38>

**Summary**

This text is a Korean folk song called "Gangwon Province Market Song" (*Kangwŏndo Changtaryeong*), listing various local markets in Gangwon Province as of 1923. Each couplet names a town's market and provides a humorous, often pun-based reason why the singer couldn't properly experience it, touching on things like road conditions, prices, local products, activities, or the singer's own mood. From a historical perspective, the song offers valuable insight into the regional geography, local economies (mentioning goods like hemp, Angelica root, fish roe, tobacco, rice, firewood), travel difficulties, and vernacular culture of Gangwon Province during the colonial period. The puns and stereotypes associated with each town provide a glimpse into local perceptions and folk humor, while the list itself documents the importance of these periodic markets in rural life.
