Establishment of Branch Division Offices and Sales Outlets

Until now, our company's business policy has focused on gaining individual readers directly, rather than establishing branch division offices (支分社) or sales outlets (分賣所). However, starting from the new year, we have decided to plan for the development of various local regions by establishing branch division offices or sales outlets wherever possible. Please review the conditions written below and consider starting a new business venture in the New Year.

Branch Offices (支社) are divided into Type A (甲種) and Type B (乙種). Type A branch offices are for those who can take responsibility for selling over 200 copies of *Kaebyŏk* (with *Sin Yŏsŏng* and *Ŏrini* treated equivalently to *Kaebyŏk*, and this applies hereafter). Type B branch offices are for those selling over 100 copies of *Kaebyŏk*.

Division Offices (分社) are for selling over 50 copies of *Kaebyŏk*.

Sales Outlets (分賣所) are for those requesting 10 or more copies of *Kaebyŏk*, *Sin Yŏsŏng*, or *Ŏrini* magazine with advance payment (先金).

Regarding matters such as deposit money (保新金 - likely 保證金), magazine prices, and discount regulations for advertisement recruitment, let's discuss them separately through direct visits (直接 往來) or written correspondence (書面).<19>

**Summary**

This announcement from the magazine *Kaebyŏk* outlines a shift in its business strategy starting in 1925. Previously focused on direct subscriptions, the company now plans to establish a network of branch offices (支社), division offices (分社), and sales outlets (分賣所) across different regions to expand its reach and promote local development. The notice details the required sales volume commitments for different types of partnerships (Type A/B Branch Offices, Division Offices, Sales Outlets) for *Kaebyŏk* and its sister publications, *Sin Yŏsŏng* and *Ŏrini*. It invites interested parties to inquire further about financial terms like deposits and discounts. From a historical perspective, this article reveals the operational expansion and evolving business practices of a major Korean publishing house during the colonial period. It highlights the challenges and strategies involved in distributing cultural products like magazines beyond the capital, reflecting efforts to build a national readership network despite colonial constraints. Historians might find the specific tiers of distributorship and the mention of sister publications useful for understanding the scale and structure of the publishing business at the time.
