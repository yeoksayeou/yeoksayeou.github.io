Night Talks of Seoul Friends (層門친구들의 學務局長타령)

A: "Hey, haven't you had a drink today?"
B: "Haven't."
A: "Is that so? Well, I've had one."
B: "Let's have one later. Let me look at the newspaper first."
A: "Alright. Is there any particular news in the paper?"
B: "Other news is just so-so... But look at this. A Korean has become the Director of the Bureau of Education (學務局長). Looks like we're being fooled again (엿을 먹나보이)."
A: "A Korean Director of the Bureau of Education? Wow, look at this. Isn't that quite a high position? So who got it?"
B: "It's a gentleman named Yi Chin-ho (李軫鎬). Yi Chin-ho!"
A: "Yi Chin-ho? Who is Yi Chin-ho?"
B: "Ah, don't you know this person? He was pursued as a political offender (國事犯) during the old Korean Empire era... and he recently served as the Governor of South Chŏlla Province."
A: "Right, right, I get it now. I've heard the name. But how did a Korean become the Director of the Bureau of Education? Isn't that some kind of trickery (야바우) again?"
B: "Who knows if it's trickery (야바우) or something else (밤바운지)? Apparently, by the great resolute decision (大英斷) of Governor-General Shimooka (下岡政務總監), from now on, they're going to appoint Koreans extensively to high official posts..."
A: "That's just talk. Do you really think they'd do that? Who do they think they are? It's all a ploy to appease public sentiment (人心)."
B: "Of course, it's a ploy to gently deceive us. Look here. After bragging about appointing Koreans (朝鮮人 登用), they say there are no suitable candidates because they have nothing else to say. No candidates... Who couldn't just keep an empty chair warm? Even I could do it... It seems they're making a big fuss as if giving one Korean the post of Director of the Bureau of Education is like giving Korea independence. – Those guys would surely do that. Look at those Koreans salivating! Probably hoping to get something, maybe a piece of taffy (엿가락) or some scraps (쪼이색)... And look here. Of all the director positions, why did they pick out the Director of the Bureau of Education to give to a Korean? Just looking at that reveals their psychology, doesn't it! Look here. Important agencies like the Police Affairs Bureau (警務局長) – police organs – or the Industrial Development Bureau (殖産局長) – industrial organs – they keep the heads of those entirely for themselves and gave away the figurehead Director of the Bureau of Education (有名無實의 學務局長). It's not that the Director of the Bureau of Education isn't important, but in Korea, it's truly just a figurehead position. Under the Governor-General's education policy, they say the Bureau of Education just involves sitting in an empty chair, keeping it warm, and smoking cigarettes."
A: "What does it matter to us whether it's a Director of the Bureau of Education stuck in a rut or an ant's nostril? Come on, let's go. Let's have a round."

The Problem of the "Seaweed Soup" Officials (미역국 官吏問題)

Kim: "Hey, lately I've been racking my brain with useless worries."
Pak: "What worries? What's there to worry about?"
Kim: "No, this really is a big worry."
Pak: "What is it? What?"
Kim: "Well, look here. With the administrative restructuring (行政整理) and all, what's going to happen to those friends who got the sack (미역국 친구들)?"
Pak: "Good grief, damn it. I thought you had some serious worry... Well, it is a worry, haha..."
Kim: "Hey, isn't it a worry? What will they do for a living? Retired officials (官吏退物)..."
Pak: "Still, they have no problem. They saved money from their salaries, got severance pay (退職金), and on top of that, they get pensions (恩給). What's＜94＞ the worry? It's truly a useless worry."
Kim: "Ah, you don't understand. How many do you think get severance pay or pensions? Even if there are some, they're likely Japanese cronies. Putting those aside, what about those guys who served as mere policemen (巡査나부랭이) or clerks (*員낫치) in the provinces? Aren't they the real worry? What will they do for a living?"
Pak: "Well, it is a worry... It'll be hard for them to become officials again, they can't farm, they probably can't run a business... It's truly pitiful."
Kim: "Is that all? The job problem is secondary; haven't they lost public trust (人心) considerably? Whether they go to the market or the village, they just get pointed at. Where can they attach themselves (付接)?"
Pak: "Right! There's one perfect option for them. Going to the countryside, even deep into the mountains, and doing some pimping (蝎甫장사) would suit them best. Leveraging the lingering influence of having been an official, maybe getting a soju jug (燒酒동) and setting up shop..."
Kim: "Hey, don't say that. The country folk and mountain folk are quite shrewd; they wouldn't even let those types in. That might have worked 6 or 7 years ago when they acted like assistant officials (補助員), but now it's out of the question. People view them as less than foot wraps (발싸개). Besides, especially in places like North P'yŏngan (平北) or North Hamgyŏng (咸北), with the influence of the Independence Party (獨立黨), they can't even set foot there. No chance."
Pak: "That's true too. Then, what will they do? It really is a worry. Maybe scrape by as petition writers (代書낫치)? That's not easy either. Become teachers (敎員낫치)? That's even more impossible... They're doomed, doomed. It's truly dismissal (クヒキル - kubikiru). Just the administrative restructuring (漫畵削除-원문 - caricature deleted-original text)... it has killed off many people... Anyway, hey, worrying about others has created another worry for us. Just idle chatter. When will this work get done? Just addressing the envelopes (封皮) alone will take writing 500 – Come on, let's write for a while and then talk again."

The Problem of the Kyŏngnam Provincial Office (問題의 慶南道廳)
(Following deleted - original text) (＜95＞)

(This section deleted - original text)

Kim: "Let's light up a cigarette and then write."

The Problem of Japanese Military Education (問題의 日本軍事敎育)

Kim: "Hey, Japan is really thorough, isn't it? Look at this. They're even giving military education to students. That's why the students' opposition movement against the Ministry of Education (文部省) is tremendous... I really don't know what they're thinking. While the League of Nations (國際聯盟) holds disarmament conferences (軍縮會議) day and night, Denmark (丁抹) scraps its army and navy, Spain (西班牙) abolishes its military government, and China (中國) talks loudly about abolishing military governors and reducing troops (廢督裁兵), Japan goes the opposite way, giving military education even to students."
Pak: "Let them do military education or conscription education, whatever they want. What concern is it of ours? If they prosper, they prosper themselves; if they fall, they fall themselves. Let's just do our own work."
Kim: "Hey, what do you mean it's no concern of ours? What concern does Labor-Farmer Russia (勞農 露西亞) have with us that they eagerly try to propagate their ideology? What concern does China have with us that we worry day and night about the turmoil in China? If you think about it, everything is related. Though one could say it isn't..."
Pak: "That's true. But what I meant by 'no concern'＜96＞ is that it won't have any impact on us or the world. Why worry about something that will have no effect?"
Kim: "That seems plausible... Then let's drop it."

The Problem of China's Three Giants (問題의 中國 三巨頭)

Pak: "Hey, how do you see it?"
Kim: "See what?"
Pak: "Those so-called Three Giants (三巨頭) of China."
Kim: "Ah, you mean Duan Qirui (段祺瑞), Zhang Zuolin (張作霖), and Sun Yat-sen (孫文)?"
Pak: "Yes."
Kim: "Indeed, I was meaning to ask you about that. That bandit chief (馬賊魁首), that bumpkin (우멍구럭이), the warlord faction (軍閥泒) boss Zhang Zuolin advocating for abolishing military governors and reducing troops (廢督裁兵), offering up his position as Inspector General (巡閱使), and acting all slippery – it's quite strange and questionable. Whatever he is, he's certainly an adventurer (風雲兒). Claiming victory, he sits back and puts on airs of respectability... Anyway, he's one of the questionable figures. And Duan Qirui, sitting quietly, received the prize from within his den and seems to be playing the role of chief executive quite well, but he also seems like an ambitious man (野心家). Looking at his attitude towards Sun Yat-sen, at first he pretended to decline politely, saying he would wait for Sun Yat-sen's arrival in Beijing (北京) to discuss things – but then, when Sun Yat-sen really left Shanghai (上海), he probably thought, 'Oh no, if Sun comes, I'll lose my position. I need to grab it quickly before he gets here,' and hastily slipped into the seat... Anyway, ambition alone won't work. Everyone has that much ambition... His seat is also on pins and needles (바늘方席)... And then there's Sun Yat-sen. What will happen if he enters Beijing? Is he planning to snatch Duan's position? Will he implement his own principles? It's also questionable how he came to associate with his former enemies, Brother Duan and Brother Zhang. Although circumstances led to it... And on the path to discussing matters of national importance, what was the purpose of visiting Japan (日本訪問), which he used to treat as an enemy country? After connecting with the United States (米國) and being unsuccessful (不), and connecting with Russia (露國) and also being unsuccessful (不), perhaps it's a last resort (最後 窮策), but in any case, he's a man of question (疑問의 人). Do you have any sense of it?"
Pak: "Well, I also find it questionable. It doesn't seem like it will be Sun Yat-sen's China yet. Maybe after Zhang Zuolin carries Duan Qirui for a while and runs his course... Anyway, how would we, who aren't politicians (政客), know? Let's just wait and see."

Egypt is Red Territory Again (埃及은 또 赤地)

Kim: "Hey, Egypt (埃及) has become red territory (赤地) again."
Pak: "Red territory? You mean it's become communist (勞農化)?"
Kim: "You're good at twisting words. I mean the recent Anglo-Egyptian problem (英埃問題)."
Pak: "Ah, right, right. Anyway, it seems the weak can't survive in this world anymore. Look, the head of one strong nation guy is worth ten million heads of weak nation guys. This time too, in response to the assassination of one Sirdar ('스탄' 總督), they have to pay 500,000 pounds (五十萬磅) in compensation, punish the culprits, apologize as a nation, and still, Britain (英國) insists on perpetuating foreign advisors and demands absolute cessation of political demonstrations, among many other conditions. It's truly red territory. Red territory! It's a world where the weak cannot survive. On top of that, those shady characters at the League of Nations (國際聯盟), claiming Egypt didn't join the League, turn a deaf ear (聽而不聞) to Egypt's desperate and sorrowful appeal. It's infuriating! Egypt is truly unfortunate. Only 2 or 3 years after achieving even formal independence, they suffer such trampling (蹂躪) again. When will they ever rise up, grow strong, and run alongside others? Ugh, those damned British... See how after the Labour Party (勞動黨) lost and the Conservative Party (保守黨) rose, they proposed an unreasonable break in relations with Russia. Look, they're using a single forged document, the so-called 'Zinoviev' Letter ('지노비에프'書簡), as a pretext to repudiate the previous cabinet's treaty... Hah, ridiculous. Of course, the underlying reason is anti-communism (赤化反對). When will those guys ever fall?..."
Kim: "Shh... The night is late, and it's distressing. Let's stop talking and go."
Pak: "Alright, we've talked quite a bit about this and that. Let's go."＜97＞
＜94-97＞

**Summary**

This article presents a series of conversations among Seoul acquaintances in late 1924/early 1925, reflecting contemporary Korean perspectives on various issues under Japanese colonial rule. They discuss the cynical appointment of a Korean, Yi Chin-ho, to a high but powerless position (Director of Education), the plight of dismissed Korean lower officials facing unemployment and social stigma, Japan's increasing militarization through student military training despite international disarmament trends, the complex political maneuvering among China's leaders (Duan Qirui, Zhang Zuolin, Sun Yat-sen), and the harsh British response to the assassination of the Sirdar in Egypt, lamenting the powerlessness of weaker nations. The conversations reveal deep skepticism towards Japanese colonial policies, concern for the socio-economic challenges facing Koreans, and an awareness of international events viewed through the lens of imperialism and national weakness. For historians, these dialogues offer a valuable glimpse into the private discourse, political consciousness, and critical viewpoints of urban Koreans during the "cultural rule" period, showing their engagement with both domestic colonial realities and broader geopolitical dynamics. The casual, colloquial language mixed with discussions of high politics provides a unique texture.
