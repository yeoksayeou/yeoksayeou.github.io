**Summary**

This entry indicates that the full text of the article titled "The Education System of Worker-Peasant Russia" by Kim Kyŏngjae, originally spanning pages 61 to 69, was deleted from this issue of the magazine *Kaebyŏk*. The title itself is significant, showing Korean intellectual interest in the Soviet Union's (referred to as "Worker-Peasant Russia") social systems, particularly education, during the colonial period. For historians, this points to the exploration of alternative models of social organization and governance among Korean thinkers facing Japanese colonial rule, with particular attention paid to the nascent communist state.
