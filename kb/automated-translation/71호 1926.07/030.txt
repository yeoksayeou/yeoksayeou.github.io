**Summary**

This article, titled "The End of Modern Colonial Policy (The Origin and History of Modern Colonial Policy, Part 3)" by Pak Hyŏngbyŏng, appeared in the July 1, 1926 issue of *Kaebyŏk* magazine. As the main text is missing, the content cannot be summarized. However, the title suggests a critical examination of the trajectory and potential conclusion of contemporary colonial policies, positioning it as the third part of a series exploring their origins. For historians studying Korean colonial history, the title alone is significant. Published in 1926 within colonized Korea, an article discussing the "End of Modern Colonial Policy" points towards anti-colonial sentiment or discourse, potentially analyzing the unsustainability or changing nature of imperialism during that era. Its presence in *Kaebyŏk*, a known nationalist magazine often subject to censorship, further highlights its potential importance as a piece reflecting Korean intellectual thought on the future of colonialism.
