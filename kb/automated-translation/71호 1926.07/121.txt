**Summary**

This article is a series of company announcements from the Korean magazine "Kaebyŏk" dated July 1, 1926. It details the establishment of new branches in T'ongyŏng, Tangjin, and Sach'ŏn, providing their locations, coverage areas, and key personnel. It also reports significant staff changes in the Kando branch, with the previous management dismissed and new staff appointed, and notes the resignation due to illness of the General Affairs manager in the Yŏnghŭng branch. For historians, the text documents the expanding organizational network of a major cultural and potentially nationalist publication during the Japanese colonial period. The specific mention of a branch and personnel changes in Kando (Jiandao, Manchuria) is particularly noteworthy, highlighting the magazine's reach into Korean communities outside the peninsula, a region known for its significant Korean diaspora and independence movement activities.
