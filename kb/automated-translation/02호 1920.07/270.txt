A handful of earth (一抔) is not yet dry (未乾), yet where has the three-foot orphan (三尺의 孤) gone... Try looking upon the capital city (城中) today. Whose world (天下) will it eventually become?

This is a passage (一節) from the declaration (檄文) by Yŏnggong I Kyŏngŏp (英公李敬業) denouncing Empress Wu (武后) when, after Emperor Kojong (高宗) of China's T'ang (支那唐) dynasty passed away (崩) and his burial mound's earth (陵土) was not yet dry (未乾), his empress consort (皇后), Empress Wu, killed many (多殺) of the T'ang imperial family (宗室) and sought to persecute (迫) his orphaned son (遺子).<97>

**Summary**

This short piece presents a quote from a historical Chinese declaration written by Li Jingye against Empress Wu Zetian. The quote laments the usurpation of power and persecution of the rightful heir immediately following the death of Emperor Gaozong, questioning whose rule the land now falls under. In the context of 1920 Korea under Japanese rule, this historical quote serves as a powerful, albeit veiled, critique of the colonial situation. Historians might find it interesting as an example of indirect political commentary and resistance through historical allegory, common in censored publications during the colonial period. It reflects a sense of loss, injustice, and questioning of the legitimacy of the ruling power.
