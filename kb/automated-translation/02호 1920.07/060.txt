Discussing Kim Pang-gyŏng, a Great Figure of Koryŏ
						Mulchae Song Sun-gwi

1. Introduction
The old passes and the new comes; observing vertically the past and horizontally the present, the elapsed years have never been short, nor have the teeming lives of the green populace ever been few. However, within that long passage of years and among the numerous peoples, that is, the countless masses, truly great figures have originally been rare in kind and few in number. Therefore, there is a saying passed down from ancient times: "Heroes and men of prowess are not always present in the world (世不常有)." Thus, speaking of the West, the likes of Napoleon (拿破論) and Bismarck (稗斯麥) could not emerge in every generation; in the East, China's Guan Zhong (管仲) and Zhuge Liang (諸葛), Japan's Hōjō Tokimune (北條時宗) and Hosokawa Yoriyuki (細川賴之), and in our Chosŏn, figures like Kang Kam-ch'an (姜邯贊) and Yi Sun-sin (李舜臣) were also not constantly present in the world. Therefore, if what we now call great figures were to emerge in every generation and each were capable, then heroes, men of prowess, and whatever else would have nothing sufficiently high or noble about them.

Therefore, heroes and men of prowess possess great character, thus they have great thoughts; having great thoughts, they accomplish great deeds; accomplishing great deeds, their great fame shakes their own time and resounds in later generations. Thus, a great figure, speaking narrowly, saves the world and pacifies the people; speaking broadly, they can manage heaven and earth and mend the universe (乾坤). Therefore, such figures cannot be lightly regarded even if one tries, nor can they be insulted even if one tries; moreover, not only in their own time but even those living thousands of years later cannot help but spontaneously love, respect, and admire them.

2. The Lovable, Respectable, Admirable Kim Pang-gyŏng
The reporter here loves, respects, and admires Kim Pang-gyŏng, whose fame was brilliant and achievements lofty during the reigns of Koryŏ's King Kowŏn and King Chungnyŏl. But for what reason do we love, respect, and admire him? Is it because Kim Pang-gyŏng was a descendant of the sage kings of Silla (新羅 列聖朝) and the progeny of Koryŏ's Chief Attack Officer *jŏn (大攻丞*傳), having a particularly high family background? ... No. Then is it because of his flourishing power and brilliant influence, high office and noble rank during his time? Entering [the court], he became a minister; going out [to the field], he became a general. Initially, he bore the weighty responsibility (斧鉞之任) of attacking and conquering as the Commander-in-Chief of Forces (兵馬都元師), and later, with great prominence and nobility, he became the Duke of Sangnak, Founding Count (上洛公開國伯). Is it for this high and illustrious position? No. If <31> one were to love, respect, and admire him because he was from a renowned and powerful family, then Ch'oe Ch'ung-hŏn (崔忠獻), whose family held ducal and marquis ranks for four generations, whose high lineage and extreme wealth and honor were arguably number one during Koryŏ's 400 years, yet we not only do not love, respect, and admire him but, on the contrary, spit upon and curse him. Also, if one were to love, respect, and admire someone for holding prominent office and key positions, residing below only one person and above ten thousand, possessing flourishing and brilliant power and high, noble status, then Yi Cha-gyŏm (李資謙), the maternal grandfather of Koryŏ's King Injong, who held the glorious title Duke of Chosŏn (朝鮮公) and stood above all officials, whose power could overshadow the ruler and whose authority could move the world, was in such a position, yet today, do we not only fail to love, respect, and admire him but, on the contrary, condemn and criticize him? Then, under what circumstances, for what reasons, do we love, respect, and admire that Kim Pang-gyŏng? Without needing many words, it is his noble character and greatness as a person that we love, respect, and admire.

3. Kim Pang-gyŏng: Broadly Learned, Widely Heard, Knowledgeable, Capable, and a Master of Literature

Kim Pang-gyŏng was a man whose natural genius was outstanding and whose intelligence surpassed others. Kim Pang-gyŏng was a man who loved learning tirelessly (好學不厭) and earnestly never knew fatigue (拳拳)! Kim Pang-gyŏng was a man broadly learned and widely heard, knowledgeable and capable in many things (博學多聞하며 多知多能). Kim Pang-gyŏng was a man who magnanimously embraced great ambition like a roc's flight of ten thousand *li* (鵬程萬里) and was unconcerned with minor details (小節)!
Because of this, Kim Pang-gyŏng possessed the talent to never forget what he saw (過目不忘) and remember after one * glance (一*輒記) since childhood, and thus broadly read numerous books, greatly advancing in scholarship before reaching the age of maturity (弱冠). Since ancient times, it is easy for talent to overcome virtue, and when talent overcomes virtue, one becomes a petty person. Also, when talent is high, it is easy to become unrestrained and dissolute, reckless and impetuous, shallow and exposed—such people are many; also, those who rely on their talent often have full hearts (滿) and high spirits (氣), becoming imposing and self-important (巍然自大), arrogant and self-indulgent (驕昂自恣), accounting for six or seven out of ten. However, Kim Pang-gyŏng, commensurate with his high talent, had rich learning, and accompanying his rich learning, his virtue was profound. He was brilliant yet resolute (英明沉毅), magnanimous yet serious and taciturn (寬厚重黙). He might seem like a common man, but he was not; he might seem like a scholar, but he was not just a scholar. He firmly maintained the demeanor of a gentleman (君子) and transcendently bore the air of a hero (英雄). This was the embryonic substance that formed the great vessel and talent who would later enter the court as a minister and go out as a general (出將入相), and the driving force that accomplished world-shaking great merits and extraordinary achievements (鳴天動地 豐攻偉勳).
Furthermore, regarding masters of literature (文章大家), they originally tend to have much flourish (華) and little substance (實), lengthy prose but thin thought, richness in form but weakness in spirit and principle (氣節). Therefore, although there may be tens of millions of words under their brush, when it comes to managing the state and governing the country (國을 經하고 邦을 治하는데), or facing calamity and controlling the enemy <32>, they cannot extend even half a stratagem (半籌之謀) nor exert the strength of one arm (一臂之力)—such cases are extremely rare, and examples have not been lacking since ancient times. Thus, the great Song scholar Cheng Yi Ch'uan (程伊川) taught, "Having high talent and literary skill is a person's misfortune," and also said, "Those concerned only with literary expression are vulgar." For instance, speaking of Silla's Kang Su (强首) and Koryŏ's Yi Kyu-bo (李奎報), their literary works could certainly startle people and resonate through the ages, but they excelled only in literary expression; they lacked the capacity for statecraft (經國治邦) and the talent to rectify crises and support the endangered (靖端難扶危), being merely men of letters. However, Kim Pang-gyŏng's talent and learning were not inferior to theirs, and his literary skill yielded nothing to theirs; when his brush fell, wind and rain were startled, and when his poems were completed, ghosts and spirits wept—he was, without shame, a great man of letters (大文士) and a great master (大方家). But it is not solely for this that we point to him as a great figure. In other words, when the country was well-governed, he became a wise minister and good aide (賢相良佐), standing in the court (廟堂) to govern the hundred officials and soothe the myriad people; when the country was in chaos, he became a famed general and brave warrior (名將勇士), standing on the field of arrows and stones (矢石之場) to win every battle and achieve certain success (戰必勝功必取). Such great talent resided solely in Kim Pang-gyŏng. This is why he is called a great figure who transcended the world (世) and surpassed others (人). Despite the saying that military commanders often lack literary skill and men of letters often lack martial skill, he truly combined both civil and martial virtues (文武兼全), a hero not seen in every generation (不世出).

4. Kim Pang-gyŏng: Man of Foresight, Clear Vision, Great Wisdom, and Great Deliberation
Kim Pang-gyŏng was not a man of narrow perspective but one with far-reaching vision (遠大之識見). Kim Pang-gyŏng was not one possessing ordinary wisdom but a man endowed with special wisdom (特別之智). Kim Pang-gyŏng was a man possessing the ability of foresight (前知之能) and the clarity of prevision (先見之明). Let me introduce one incident: In the 35th year of King Kojong (高宗), he held the minor post of Military Inspector (兵馬判官). At that time, the Mongols (蒙古) were powerful, annually raising large armies, invading the border regions, plundering wherever they went, massacring the populace, indulging in cruelty, and spreading evil, so the people could not rest securely in their homes (堵) nor enjoy their livelihoods (業). In this year too, Mongol troops invaded the northern and southern borders of P'yŏngan Province, ostensibly to hunt otters (獺), but indulged in plunder wherever they passed. The border people suffered from this cruel poisoning (茶毒), finding it difficult to engage in farming. Their plight and miserable state were truly heart-wrenching to behold (滿目悽然). Thereupon, Kim Pang-gyŏng, holding the post of Northern Border Military Inspector (北界兵馬判官), moved the residents to islands in the sea. In Anbuk Prefecture (安北府), there was Ch'o-do Island (草島), where farming was impossible due to the ebb and flow of the sea tides, causing great distress among the people (民情 大히 嗷嗷). Witnessing this reality, Kim Pang-gyŏng was greatly worried and concerned (憂慮), forgetting sleep and food while seeking a good solution (善後策). The situation at the time was such that one could neither advance nor retreat<33>, a truly difficult valley to advance or retreat from (進退難谷). It was a perilous predicament where no plan seemed feasible (計不入量). At such a time, even those usually called men of strategy (智謀之士) would likely find their minds blocked and hearts unopened (心*가 闢치 못하야), unable to devise a completely safe plan (萬全之計) or even a temporary emergency measure (一時救急之方), stuck in a difficult pass unable to resolve the danger of collapse (倒*之危). However, that Kim Pang-gyŏng did not possess the pinhole-sized wisdom of common folk but wisdom like a gate (戶口); he was not one to employ temporary patchwork measures (臨時彌縫之策) for momentary expediency (一時姑息之計), but one who used a hundred-year grand plan (百年大計) for permanent happiness, complete and flawless. Thus, he formulated a plan for the people to build dikes (堤防) on all four sides to prevent the intrusion of sea tides, reclaim the land within, and plant barnyard millet (稗), promulgating and implementing it. At the time of its promulgation, everyone mocked its impracticality and ignorance (迂濶無智), suggesting it would be futile labor without gain (徒勞無功), and those arguing against it were overwhelmingly numerous (滔滔皆是). Yet Kim Pang-gyŏng alone rejected the clamorous popular opinion (紛紛衆議), insisted that his proposed plan would surely hit the mark (正鵠), and enforced its implementation. Although complaints overflowed everywhere among the populace (怨聲漲溢), when autumn arrived, the grain harvest was abundant (豐登), resulting in an unprecedented bumper crop (大稔). Consequently, among the people, every house had high stone granaries (石廩), and thousands upon thousands of storehouses (倉) were filled. Meanwhile, the Mongols (蒙丘 - derogatory term for Mongols) did not retreat year after year, but the island migrants had bountiful harvests annually, feeling not the slightest hunger or poverty, quite enjoying their livelihoods. Furthermore, as there were no wells or springs on the island, drinking water was inadequate. Kim Pang-gyŏng then built dikes (堤) to store water, creating a large reservoir (大澤), making it convenient for irrigation (灌漑) in summer and allowing ice to be cut (鑿冰) in winter, thus opening the path for the people's utilization and welfare (利用厚生).

When ice was cut in winter, opening the path for the people's utilization and welfare. At this point, the people finally recognized his great wisdom (大智), and thereafter praised his virtue (德) and cherished his benevolence (恩), allowing the entire region to find peace and stability (賴安).
Therefore, even observing this one incident, though it might not be considered a particularly great matter or great achievement (大事, 大功) in terms of Kim Pang-gyŏng's overall career, perhaps merely a small matter and small achievement (小事, 小功), it was nevertheless something beyond the capability of worldly strategists. In other words, Kim Pang-gyŏng thought what hundreds could not think and planned what thousands could not plan, a person possessing extraordinary intelligence (特別的 智能) far surpassing hundreds and thousands of people.

Five. Kim Pang-gyŏng: Valiant Warrior, Outstanding Tiger-like Official, Embracing Grand Strategy
Kim Pang-gyŏng was a man of courage, resolve, and decisiveness (勇毅果敢)! Kim Pang-gyŏng was a man who worried about the country as if it were his own family (憂國如家)! Kim Pang-gyŏng was a man possessing grand strategy and great plans (雄謀大畧). <34> Kim Pang-gyŏng was a valiant warrior (赳赳武夫) and an outstanding, tiger-like official (矯矯虎臣). During the reign of King Wŏnjong (元宗), the Sambyŏlch'o (三別抄) rose up in rebellion as a faction. The ferocity of their savage force reached extremes everywhere, resulting in a great chaos where one could say wolves and tigers ran rampant horizontally (豺虎六橫) and snakes and boars devoured repeatedly (蛇豕荐食). They invaded provinces and counties, massacred the people, burned down houses, creating a great catastrophic scene where smoke and flames filled the sky (烟焰漲天) and flesh and blood smeared the earth (血肉塗地), truly difficult to describe in words. Thereupon, King Wŏnjong, his royal worries profound (宸憂耿耿), appointed Kim Pang-gyŏng as the Rebel Suppression Envoy (逆賊追討使) to take full charge of their subjugation. Bearing this great responsibility beyond the palace gates (闡外大任), carrying the golden battle-axe (黃金斧鉞), he organized his troops (旅), displayed his authority (威), and stood resolutely on the field of arrows and stones (矢石之場).
In the 12th year of Wŏnjong, Kim Pang-gyŏng, with imposing force (桓桓之勢) and majestic authority (堂堂之威), pursued and attacked the rebels, achieving many victories. In the 3rd month of that year, together with the Yuan generals Hong Ta-gu (洪茶丘) and Hŭn To (忻都), he greatly defeated the rebels at Chindo (珍島), killing and capturing a great many. Finally pursuing the fleeing and chasing the retreating (追奔逐北), he pressed the rebels hard. Their remaining partisans fled into T'amna (耽羅 - Jeju Island) and gathered forces again, their strength reviving greatly. The rebels built inner and outer fortifications, relying on their defensibility, and again unleashed the poison of vipers and snakes (虺蛇之毒), raiding provinces and counties almost daily (殆虛日無). The royal court then appointed Kim Pang-gyŏng as the Grand Marshal of the Central Army (中軍兵馬大元師), placing the responsibility of the nation's stronghold (國家千城之任) on his shoulders. Leading over ten thousand soldiers, soaring like a swift bird (*揚飛翰) and rushing like lightning (電馳奮迅), he reached T'amna with warships (戰艦) and entered Hamdŏkpo harbor (咸德浦). Rebel ambush troops suddenly arose, attempting to surround the government forces. With a great shout from Kim Pang-gyŏng, the rebel momentum was finally swept away like the wind (風靡), and they fled into the inner citadel (子城). Thereupon, the government forces, riding the victory, charged forward (乘勝長驅), crossed the outer wall, swept it clean, and beheaded the rebel leader. With this, the world found peace from turmoil (難靖) and the flames of war were extinguished (兵燹熄).
The ancients said that one cannot speak of ice to a summer insect (夏蟲語氷), nor can one consult a petty person on great matters (小人問大事). At that time, the rebels' strength was so rampant, the people's suffering so cruel (塗炭慘酷), and the nation's power so weak. Even if there were some strategists and brave generals, confronting the enemy, they would have been unequal in strength (强弱不同) and outnumbered (衆寡不敵), unable to execute their plans or employ their courage. However, Kim Pang-gyŏng was not one possessing mere strategies for temporary fixes (一時彌縫), nor one with only the martial prowess to face a single enemy. He transcendently stood out from his kind (類) and rose above the crowd (萃). Therefore, although he received the strength of Yuan's arm (元一臂之力), the great merit and extraordinary achievement (偉功奇勳) of securing the nation and protecting the people must solely be attributed to this Kim Pang-gyŏng.

Six. Conclusion
For instance, though it is the same wood, the *ch'u* and *yŏk* trees (樗櫟 - useless trees) are regarded as base, while the paulownia and catalpa (桐梓<35> - useful timber) are valued. Though it is the same bird, the owl (䲭鴞) is regarded lightly, while the phoenix (鳳凰) is valued highly. Though it is the same beast, the pig and dog (豚犬) are base, while the tortoise and qilin (龜麟) are precious. What is the reason for this? It points to nothing other than the nobility of their virtue and character (德性, 品格). By the same principle, though they are the same humans, the great person (大人) is high and noble, while the common person (凡人) is low and base. What is the reason for this? This too refers to their capacity, character, and value (材器, 品格, 價値). Therefore, if a person is truly brilliant, heroic, and outstanding (英邁雄豪), not only contemporary people but also those living thousands of years later will look up to and admire (推仰, 景慕) them. Conversely, if one is mediocre and vulgar (傭俗), lacking talent (材), base and vile (鄙劣), lacking virtue (德), not only contemporaries but also those living hundreds of generations later will disdain and slight (凌侮, 輕忽) them. Thus, an old saying goes, "Having obtained the right person, value them like a mountain; having not obtained the right person, slight them like grass (得其人重之如山 不得其人忽之如草)." Therefore, how could our love, respect, and admiration for Kim Pang-gyŏng, living hundreds of generations later, lie elsewhere? It is nothing other than what has been stated above. However, I say it is extremely improper and unacceptable to merely love, respect, and admire him idly (徒然). We should emulate him (效) and learn from him (學). There is nothing that cannot be achieved by learning, and nothing that cannot be attained by learning. If we learn his virtue, learn his wisdom, learn his courage, and attain them, who knows if millions of Kim Pang-gyŏngs might spring forth (簇出) across our peninsula's land and sky? Therefore, let us not forget these five characters: "I wish to learn from Kim Pang-gyŏng (願學金方慶)."<36>

**Summary**

This 1920 article by Song Sun-gwi passionately argues for the greatness of the 13th-century Koryŏ general and statesman Kim Pang-gyŏng. The author extols Kim's noble lineage but emphasizes that true admiration stems not from birth or rank, but from his exceptional character, encompassing profound learning, literary mastery, foresight demonstrated through practical problem-solving (like land reclamation on Ch'o-do island), and decisive military leadership, particularly in suppressing the Sambyŏlch'o rebellion. The article concludes by urging readers not just to admire Kim Pang-gyŏng but to actively learn from his virtues (wisdom, courage, character) as a model for contemporary Koreans. From the perspective of Korean colonial history, this article is significant as it represents an attempt to bolster national pride and identity under Japanese rule by celebrating a pre-colonial Korean hero known for both civil and martial virtues, subtly presenting him as an ideal Korean figure to emulate in challenging times. The call to "learn from Kim Pang-gyŏng" can be interpreted as a call for national strengthening and resilience.

金方慶氏는 天才가 穎悟하야 聰明이 絶人한 人이니라. 金方慶氏는 好學不厭하야 拳拳히 倦할줄 不知하는 人이니라!! 金方慶氏는 博學多聞하며 多知多能한 人이니라. 金方慶氏는 慷慨히 鵬程萬里의 大志를 抱하고 小節에 不拘하는 人이니라!
이러함으로 金方慶氏는 幼時로부터 過目不忘하며 一*輒記하는 才가 有하얏슴으로 筆書를 博覽하야 弱冠의 歲에 不及하야 學問이 大進하얏더라. 古로부터 才가 多하면 德을 勝하기 易하고 才가 德을 勝하면 小人이 되는 것이오. 又才가 高하면 放曠하고 荒悖하기 易하고 浮躁하고 淺露한 者―多하며 又才를 恃하면 其心이 滿하고 其氣가 高하야 巍然自大하며 驕昂自恣하는 者가 10의 6, 7을 占하는 것이지마는 金方慶氏는 才가 高함을 隨하야 學이 富하며 學이 富함을 伴하야 德이 厚하야 英明하고도 沉毅하며 寬厚하고도 重黙하야 俗人 이것만 俗人이 아니며 書生 이것만 書生이 아니얏나니 씨는 儼然히 君子의 態度를 持하얏스며 超然히 英雄의 氣風을 帶하얏나니 此가 他日에 出將入相하는 大器大材를 成한 胚胎物이며 鳴天動地하는 豐攻偉勳을 遂한 原動力이엇섯나리라.
그리고 또 文章大家라는 것은 元來 華가 多하고 實이 少하며 文辭는 長하나 思想이 薄하며 形式에는 富하나 氣節이 弱하나니 그럼으로 筆下에는 비록 數千萬 言이 有할지라도 國을 經하고 邦을 治하는데와 難에 臨하야 敵을 制함에＜32＞ 對하야는 半籌의 謀를 展치 못하며 一臂의 力을 運하는 者 - 極히 罕少하야 古來부터 其例가 乏치 아니 하얏나니 故로 宋의 大學者인 程伊川이 가르되 「有高才能文章, 人之不幸」이라 하며 又曰하되 「彼以文辭而已者는 陋矣」라 하엿나니라. 假令 新羅의 强首와 高麗의 李奎報로 말하면 그 文章이 能히 人을 驚하며 世를 鳴하엿지마는 彼는 오즉 文辭에만 長할 뿐이오 經國治邦의 器가 乏하며 靖端難扶危의 才가 無하야 오즉 一個 文士에 不過하얏도다. 그러나 金方慶씨는 그 才學이 彼보다 劣치 아니하며 그 文章이 彼에 讓치 아니하야 筆이 落하면 風雨가 驚하며 詩가 成하면 鬼神이 泣하는 大文士이며 大方家됨에 無愧하지마는 이것 뿐 만으로써 氏를 偉大한 人物이라 指함은 아니라 곳 말하자면 國이 治함에는 賢相良佐로 廟堂에 處하야 百官을 治하고 萬民을 撫하는 大材가 되며 國이 亂함에는 名將勇士로 矢石의 場에 立하야 戰必勝功必取하는 大材가 有한 者는 오즉 金方慶氏이니 此가 이른바 世에 超하며 人에 過한 偉大한 人物이라 稱하는 所以이라. 世에 武將은 文이 少하며 文士는 武가 少하다함에 不拘하고 氏는 實로 文武를 兼全한 不世出의 英雄이엇섯나니라.

4. 前知의 能, 先見의 明, 大智大慮의 金方慶氏
金方慶氏는 狹小한 識見이 아니라 遠大의 識見이 有한 人이니라. 金方慶氏는 普通의 智를 有한 者이 아니라 特別의 智를 具한 人이니라. 金方慶氏는 前知의 能과 先見의 明이 有한 人이니라. 今에 그 一事를 紹介하건대 高宗 35年에 氏는 兵馬判官이란 微職에 靡하얏섯는대 其時에는 蒙古가 强盛하야 年年이 大兵을 提하고 邊境을 入冠하야 所至에 侵略하야 百姓을 殘害하며 兇을 肆하고 惡을 播함으로 民이 그堵를 安하야 그 業을 樂치 못하얏더라. 是歲에도 蒙兵이 平安南北界에 侵入하야 獺을 捕한다. 言을 託하고 所過에 縱掠을 肆함으로 邊境의 民이 茶毒에 苦하야 耕作의 事를 營爲키 難하야 그 窮途慘狀은 實로 滿目悽然한지라 於是에 北界兵馬判官의 職을 帶한 金方慶氏는 居民을 移하야 모다 海島에 入하야 居하게 하얏는대 安北府에 草島가 有하야 海潮의 出入으로 耕種함을 不得하야 民情 大히 嗷嗷한지라 金方慶氏는 此實況을 目擊하고 大히 優하고 慮하야 寢食을 忘하고 此善後의 策을 講究하얏도다. 當時의 情況으로 말하면 進하려도 進할 수 업고 退하려도＜33＞ 退할 수 업서서 可謂進退難谷이오. 計不入量인 危險千萬의 窮境에 陷하야젓는대 此時를 當하야 平日에 所謂 智謀의 士라고 稱하는 者等도 腦管이 通치 못하며 心*가 闢치 못하야 能히 그 萬全의 計로써 一時救急의 方도 案出치 못하야 그 倒*의 危를 解치 못하는 難關에 處하얏슬 터이지마는 오즉 彼金方慶氏는 俗子의 針孔만한 智을 有함이 아니라 戶口와 如한 智를 有하얏스며 普通人의 臨時 彌縫의 策을 運하야 一時姑息의 計를 取하는 者이 아니라 完全無缺하게 永久한 幸福을 享受할 百年의 大計를 用하얏더라. 그리하야 氏는 民으로 하야곰 四圍에 堤防을 築하야 海潮의 侵入을 防케 하고 其中에서 開墾하야 稗를 種케 하는 案을 制定하야 此를 公布실시케 하얏는대 本案을 公布하던 當時에는 人人마다 그 迂濶無智함을 譏하며 徒勞無功할 것을 提唱하야 그 不可함을 說하는 者가 滔滔皆是인 狀態에 在하얏섯는대 金防慶氏는 호을로 그 紛紛한 衆議를 排하고 自己의 案出한 計劃이 반듯이 그 正鵠을 中할 것을 主張하고 强制的으로 此를 實行케 하얏는대 民間에는 到處에 怨聲이 漲溢하더니 밋 그 秋期에 至하야는 種穀이 豐登하야 無前의 大稔을 致하얏슴으로 於是乎民間에는 家家에 石廩이 高하야 千斯萬斯의 倉이 充實하게 되엇더라. 그런대 蒙丘은 歲를 運하야 退치 아니하고 島中의 移民은 年年히 歲가 登함으로 小毫의 饑窮을 感치 아니하야 頗히 그 業을 樂하며 島中에 또 井泉이 無하야 飮用의 水가 不適함으로 金防慶씨는 이에 堤를 築하고 水를 貯하야 大澤을 爲하고 夏에는 灌漑에 便케 하고 冬에는 冰을 鑿하야 人民의 利用厚生의 道를 開케 하엿더라.
冬에는 氷을 鑿하야 人民의 利用厚生의 道를 開케 하얏더라. 此에 至하매 人民은 비롯오 그 大智를 眼하고 此後로는 그 德을 頌하며 그 恩을 懷하야 一境이 賴安함을 得하얏도다.
그런즉 此一事를 觀할지라도 此가 金方慶씨의 事業上으로는 特別한 大事와 大功이 아니며 僅이 小事와 小功됨에 不過하다 하겟지마는 하여간 此가 世俗智謀의 士의 能히 及할 바-아니니 곳 말하자면 金方慶氏는 百人이 思치 못한 바를 思하얏스며 千人이 謀치 못한 바를 謀한 者로 百人千人의 頭上에 逈出한 特別的 智能을 具한 者라고 謂치 아니치 못할지로다.

五. 赳赳한 武夫, 矯矯한 虎臣, 雄謀大畧을 抱한 金方慶氏
金方慶氏는 勇毅果敢한 人이니라! 金方慶氏는 憂國如家하는 人이니라! 金方慶氏는 雄謀大畧이 有한 人이니라. ＜34＞ 金方慶氏는 赳赳한 武夫-며 矯矯한 虎臣이엇섯나니라. 元宗의 世에 三別抄가 黨을 擧하야 叛하매 그 兇獰의 勢는 到處에 猖獗을 極하야 可謂 豺虎가 六橫하며 蛇豕가 荐食하는 大亂을 致하얏는대 彼는 州郡을 侵略하야 人民을 殺戮하며 家屋을 燒蕩하야 烟焰이 天에 漲하고 血肉이 地에 塗하는 大慘狀은 可히 形言키 難한 此時이엇더라. 이에 元宗께서는 宸憂가 耿耿하사 金方慶으로 逆賊追討使를 拜하야써 그 征伐을 專케 하셧는대 氏는 이에 闡外의 大任을 帶하고 黃金의 斧鉞을 携하고 그 旅를 整하며 그 威를 揚하야 屹然히 矢石의 場에 立하얏도다.
元宗 12年에 金方慶氏는 桓桓의 勢와 堂堂의 威로써 賊을 追討하야 前後에 勝捷이 多하얏고 是歲 3月에 元將 洪茶丘 及 忻都로 더불어 珍島에서 賊을 大破하야 殺獲이 甚衆한지라. 遂히 追奔逐北하야 賊을 逼하니 그 餘黨이 耽羅에 竄入하야 更히 軍衆을 嘯聚하매 그 勢가 更히 大振하고 賊은 內外城을 築하야 그 險固를 恃하고 更히 虺蛇의 毒을 肆하야 州郡을 寇掠하매 殆히 虛日이 無하얏더라. 朝廷에서는 이에 氏를 中軍兵馬大元師를 拜하야 國家千城의 任을 그 雙肩上에 負荷하얏섯도다. 氏는 이에 萬餘人의 軍卒을 提하고 *揚飛翰하며 電馳奮迅하야 戰艦으로써 耽羅에 到하야 咸德浦에 入하매 賊의 伏兵이 突起하야 官軍을 圍코저 하거늘 氏는 大呼一聲에 賊勢가 遂히 風靡하야 子城으로 奔入하는지라. 이에 官軍은 乘勝長驅하야 外城을 踰하야 此를 掃蕩하고 賊長을 斬하얏는대 이에 天下는 難이 靖하고 兵燹이 熄함을 得하얏도다.
古人의 言에 夏蟲에는 可히 氷을 語치 못하며 小人에게는 可히 大事를 問치 못한다 하얏스니 此時를 當하야 賊의 勢는 如彼히 猖獗하얏스며 蒼生의 塗炭은 如彼히 慘酷하얏스며 國家의 力은 如彼히 微弱하얏스니 設令 若干의 謀士와 勇將이 有할지라도 彼를 對抗함에 强弱이 不同하며 衆寡가 不敵하야 能히 그 謀를 逞치 못하며 그 勇을 施치 못하엿슬 것이로다. 그러나 金方慶氏는 一時를 彌縫하는 策略을 有한 者가 아니며 1人을 對敵하는 勇武를 有한 者이 아니라 超然히 그 類에 出하며 그 萃에 拔하얏슴으로 비록 元의 一臂의 力을 得하얏슬지라도 專혀 國을 安케하며 民을 保케한 偉功奇勳은 오즉 此 金方慶氏에게로 歸치 아니치 못할것이로다.

六. 結論
假令 同一한 木이지마는 樗櫟을 此를 賤히 여기고 桐梓는＜35＞ 此를 貴히 여기는 것이오. 同一한 鳥이지마는 䲭鴞는 輕하되 鳳凰은 重하며 同一한 獸이지마는 豚犬은 賤하되 龜麟은 貴한 것이니 此가 何故인고. 오즉 그 德性과 品格의 高尙함을 指함에 不外한 것이니라. 此와 同理로 同一한 人이지마는 大人은 高하고 貴하며 凡人은 卑하고 賤함이니 此가 何故인가. 이것도 또한 그 材器와 品格과 價値를 謂함이니라. 그럼으로 人이 眞實로 英邁雄豪할진대 當時뿐만 아니라 幾千年 後에 在한 人도 此를 推仰하고 景慕하는 것이오. 此에 反하야 傭俗하야 材가 못되며 鄙劣하야 德이 無하면 當時는 勿論 百世下에 在한 者도 此를 凌侮하며 輕忽히 하는 것이니 故로 古語에 하얏스되 「得其人에 重之如山하고 不得其人에 忽之如草」라 하얏도다. 그런즉 吾人이 幾百世下에 在하야 彼 金方慶氏를 愛하고 敬하며 慕하는 것이 엇지 他에 在하리오. 上에 陳述함에 不外한 것이르다. 그러나 吾人이 徒然히 此를 愛하고 敬하며 慕하기만할 뿐으로는 甚히 不當하며 不可하다 하노니 吾人은 此를 效하며 此를 學할 것이라 하노라. 人이 學하야 及치 못하는 事가 無하며 學하야 達치 못하는 事가 無하나니 吾人이 彼의 德을 學하며 彼의 智를 學하며 彼의 勇을 學하야 得할진대 幾百萬의 金方慶이가 我半島天地에 簇出할지 未知이니 그런즉 吾人은 「願學金方慶」이란 5字를 妄却치 말지어다.＜36＞
