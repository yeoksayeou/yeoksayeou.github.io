Morning of Gaebyeok

a. Youths of the World of Awakening Dreams (흥몽세계)!
Here and there, joyful sounds
Fresh is our spirit
It rises. It surges.

Youth, oh youth, our youth
Towards the vast sea of stars, into the headwind!

b. Youths of the World of Awakening Dreams!
Rolling and rolling, the round shape
Shining brightly is our face
Becoming younger. Becoming stronger.

c. Youths of the World of Awakening Dreams (훔뭉세계)!
This house, that house, according to their own will
Our devotion to mend the old
Becomes firmer. Goes swiftly.

d. Youths of the World of Awakening Dreams (훔뭉세계)!
Here and there, a harmonious wind
Our dance, like a butterfly
Is superb. Is graceful.

e. Youths of the World of Awakening Dreams (훔뭉세계)!
On the deep and wide face of the sky
Our worries, old and piled up
Fade away. Are resolved.<40>

**Summary**

This poem, "Morning of Gaebyeok," celebrates the energy and potential of youth in a "World of Awakening Dreams" (흥몽세계). It calls upon young people to embrace a fresh spirit, move forward boldly ("into the headwind"), shine brightly, reform old ways ("mend the old"), dance freely, and let go of past burdens under a vast sky. The poem expresses fervent hope for renewal, strength, and liberation, likely reflecting the spirit of cultural and national awakening in early colonial Korea. For historians, the poem is significant as it encapsulates the optimistic, forward-looking, and subtly nationalistic sentiments prevalent among Korean intellectuals and youth shortly after the March 1st Movement, using the concept of 'Gaebyeok' (new creation/era) which was central to the magazine's identity and Cheondoist thought. The archaic spellings and hopeful, albeit somewhat abstract, call to action provide insight into the language and aspirations of the period.
