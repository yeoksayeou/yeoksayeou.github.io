Company Announcement

For the convenience of readers in the provinces (地方讀者), this company (本社) is in the process of establishing Kaebyŏk distribution points (開闢分賣所) in various regions (各地方). The distribution points designated thus far according to internal regulations (分賣所內規) are as follows:

● Corrections (正誤): In Issue No. 2 of this magazine (本誌), on page 2, delete the "一," before the title "Three Great Problems" (三大問題). On page 4, change the "二" before the title "Labor Problem" (勞動問題) to "一". On page 10, change the "三" before the title "Women's Problem" (婦人問題) to "二".<154>

**Summary**

This text is a company announcement from the magazine *Kaebyŏk* (開闢). It informs readers that the publisher is setting up distribution points in various regions to make the magazine more accessible outside the capital. It states that a list of currently designated locations follows (though the list itself is not included in this excerpt). The announcement also includes a list of corrections (errata) for the second issue, specifically fixing the numbering of three major article titles. For historians, this notice highlights the logistical challenges and expansion efforts of Korean nationalist publications during the early colonial period, attempting to reach a wider audience beyond Seoul. The errata section also subtly indicates the kinds of topics being discussed (major societal problems, labor, women's issues) and the basic editorial processes of the time.
