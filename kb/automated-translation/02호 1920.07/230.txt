**Body Text Translation:**
A monk (僧) is merely a beggar child (乞丐兒). Born into troubled times (亂世), how could a true man be content with learning beggary?
These are the words Japan's Toyotomi Hideyoshi cried out as he left the gate of Kōmyō-ji (光明寺), where he had relied upon in his youth. That's right. Not just a man, but a woman too would feel the same.

Should not a man of spirit (丈夫) be shattered like jade rather than remain whole like an earthenware tile (瓦甎)?
These are the words left by Saigō Takamori, hailed as a great king of character for his great achievements in Japan's Restoration (維新). If any person possesses even a fragment (一片) of spirit (精神), even if they are merely what remains after much suffering, they would naturally feel this way. In our Korean words, it is said, "Even if freezing to death, one does not warm oneself by a dog's fire (계ㅅ불)." This is truly the same tune in a different key (同曲異調).

When Duke Ai of Lu (魯袁公 - likely intended 魯哀公) in China (支那) said to Confucius (孔子), "There was a very forgetful person (健忘症人) who, while moving house (家를 移하면서), forgot (妄하얏다) his wife," Confucius immediately replied, saying, "There is one who is even worse (尤甚한 者) than that. Did not Jie and Zhou (桀紂) forget their very selves (그身)? "<87>

**Summary**

This short piece compiles three anecdotes emphasizing ambition, integrity, and self-awareness. It quotes Toyotomi Hideyoshi rejecting a passive monastic life for action, Saigō Takamori advocating for noble failure over base survival (likened to a Korean proverb about self-respect), and Confucius pointing out that forgetting one's own self and responsibilities (like the tyrants Jie and Zhou) is far worse than forgetting one's possessions or even family. From a historical perspective, the article is interesting for its use of prominent Japanese figures (Hideyoshi, Saigō) as positive examples of ambition and integrity, alongside Chinese classical references and a Korean proverb. This eclectic mix, published in a Korean nationalist magazine like *Kaebyŏk* during the colonial period, might reflect an attempt to inspire Koreans by drawing on diverse sources of strong character and spirit, even from the colonizing power, perhaps focusing on the universal virtues these figures represented rather than their national context.

僧은 乞丐兒일뿐, 男兒-亂世에 生하야 엇지 乞丐를 學함으로 足할 수 잇스리요.
日本 豐臣秀吉이 幼時에 依托하던 光明寺의 門을 나서며 絶叫한 말이다. 그러타. 男兒 말고 女子라도 그럴 것이다.

丈夫 玉이 되어 붓을 어질지언정 瓦甎이 되어 完全할 줄이 잇슬가 보냐.
日本 維新의 偉勳으로 人格의 大王이라는 西鄕隆盛의 남긴 말이다. 사람이란 다이 울다가 남은 것이나마 一片의 精神이 有하면 依例히 그러할 것이다. 우리 말에 「얼어죽어도 계ㅅ불에는 안이 쪼인다」하얏다. 正히 同曲異調이다.

支那 魯袁公이 孔子다려 「一 健忘症人이 有하야 家를 移하면서 그 妻를 妄하얏다」 한즉 孔子-문득 對하야 曰 그보다 尤甚한 者가 잇지오. 桀紂는 그身을 忘하지 안이하얏소.＜87＞
