開闢이어
						玉泉 吳尙俊

I have heard of Gaebyeok (開闢, Creation) for a long time now. I have also seen it for a long time.
Generally, what is called Gaebyeok, in terms of Chinese learning (漢學), means the creation of heaven and earth (天地開闢). Even if we rely on the incomplete theories of ancient times, it is said that some tens of thousands of years ago, Heaven opened at the time of Ja (子) and Earth split open at the time of Ch'uk (丑). If this is true, then Gaebyeok already happened in the primordial era, and from that, human life was born, and all things were born, and this has repeated until today. If so, who among us could not have heard or seen this?

Then, what does Gaebyeok in this journal today truly signify? Is it intended to trace back and discuss the primordial beginnings of the human world as mentioned above? Or is it intended to report a prediction that this heaven and earth will return to chaos (混沌) in the future and witness a new creation (新開闢)?

No. How could it be so? How could the meaning of Gaebyeok be limited only to the primordial separation [判] of Heaven and Earth? Is it not that anything and everything in the world, at any year and any time, is all Gaebyeok? Why? Because the world only evolves, and therein the small progresses to the large, the weak to the strong, and the foolish to the wise; is not this gradual progress itself Gaebyeok?

Some may say, "A period of order is followed by a period of chaos, and a period of prosperity by a period of decline—this is clear even when consulting history. Extrapolating from this, should the world not rather be called mere circulation, how can it be called only evolution?" However, that is merely observing a short distance with nearsighted eyes. Generally, order, chaos, prosperity, and decline are all merely facts lying across the process of evolution. For example [*하야], look at the structure of a mountain range. After passing through narrow flatlands, prominent peaks invariably thrust up; also examine the varying depths of flowing water. After a rapid torrent, a deep river invariably forms. How can one ignore the entirety of truth based on fleeting moments? Is not the evolution from tree-nest dwelling and fruit-eating to airplanes and submarines alone sufficient to prove the principle of evolution?

Viewed from this point, what doubt can there be that things achieve creation from other things, and time achieves creation from other times? Accordingly, even discussing the Ja opening and Ch'uk splitting in the primordial era, we can reasonably infer that preparations for creation must also have existed in the primordial era before that primordial era.

Alas! The nature of the universe constantly undergoes creation. Simultaneously, the turning wheel of nature constantly proceeds forward. We who sit upon this wheel, how can we go against evolution, how can we not follow [*順] creation?<41> The aspiration of human life always aims upward, and accordingly, was not the compass of Xuanyuan (軒轅) able to suppress the stubborn forehead of Chiyou (蚩尤)? Is it not that the 42cm cannon [獨砲 42珊] yielded to the two characters of Wilsonian Humanitarianism [韋言人道]?

Playing with soldiers in a muddy pond belongs already to the Former Heaven (先天). Accordingly, the sequence of nature's creation will also take a different direction. In ancient times, one became strong and a hegemon by being good at killing people; today, one becomes superior and a victor by being good at saving people. Judging by this, the explanation by the founder of Cheondogyo (天道敎祖) dividing the Former Heaven's creation (先天 開闢) and the Latter Heaven's creation (後天 開闢) into two stages is also quite fitting.

In the deep darkness of night, stubborn clouds stood thousands of fathoms tall, and cold wind and miserable rain battered from left and right; ears could not hear, eyes could not see, and only a single flickering lamp dimly shone, while one merely drank ice water and chewed roasted chestnuts. Yet, how fortunate that due to the motive force of the Earth's revolution, we have greeted the morning sun at the eastern window! Is this not the new voice of God after the Great War? And is not the new, a new Great Creation?

O Mr. Gaebyeok (開闢君)! Your voice already aligns with justice, and your birth is also timely for the era; truly, you are magnificent and great. How could I not celebrate, and how could the whole world not welcome you? However, in the excess of joy, I add one more word: Sir, observe the goose on yonder bank (汀渚). Its long neck and giant wings crying out loudly is exhilarating and grand, but its gait being extremely slow and clumsy is detestable. Sir, take warning from this and surely tread widely with vigorous steps befitting your voice.<42>

**Summary**

The author, O Sangjun, reflects on the meaning of "Gaebyeok" (Creation/Genesis), the title of the magazine. He argues that Gaebyeok is not merely the ancient cosmological creation but an ongoing process of evolution and progress inherent in the universe and human history. Contrasting past eras of conflict (symbolized by warfare and Xuanyuan vs. Chiyou) with a dawning new era focused on humanitarianism (symbolized by post-WWI ideals and Cheondogyo's concept of a "Latter Heaven"), he welcomes the magazine *Gaebyeok* as a timely voice for this new age. He urges the magazine to match its powerful message ("voice") with equally strong and effective action ("steps").

From a historical perspective, the article is interesting for its blend of traditional East Asian cosmology, native Korean religious thought (Cheondogyo's Sŏnch'ŏn/Huch'ŏn), and contemporary global events (post-WWI). It reflects the intellectual ferment and nationalist aspirations of Koreans in 1920, seeking a path toward progress and a "new creation" for their nation under colonial rule. The explicit reference to Cheondogyo and the implicit critique of past violence in favor of future "life-saving" principles highlight the moral and social reformist dimensions of early Korean nationalism.

開闢이어
						玉泉 吳尙俊
余는 開闢을 聞한지 已久하얏노라. 또한 見한지 已久하얏도다.
무릇 開闢이라 함은 漢學上, 天地開闢을 意味함인대 비록 不完備한 古代 學說에 徵할지라도 距今 幾萬年前 何時에 在하야 天은 子에서 開하고 地는 丑에서 闢하얏다 謂하얏나니. 果然이면 開闢은 벌서 太初 時代에 된 것으로 그에서 人生도 生하고 萬物도 生하고 하야 또 此를 重複하야써 今日에 至하야스니 然則 吾人이 誰인들 此를 聞見치 못하얏스리오.
然하면 今日 本誌에 開闢은 果然 何를 意味함인가? 上述함과 如한 人世 太初를 溯論코자 함인가. 또한 此 天地가 將來 混沌에 復歸하야 新開闢을 更見하리라는 豫報를 報코자 爲함인가.
否라. 엇지 其然하리오. 開闢이란 것이 엇지 太初의 天地 *判에만 限한 意義뿐이리오. 世間의 何事何物이던지 何年何時이던지 모다 開闢이 안임이 안일지로다. 何者오 하면 世界는 오즉 進化할 뿐으로서 그에서 小는 大로 弱은 强으로, 愚는 智로 漸進하나니 그의 漸進이 卽 開闢이 안인가.
或曰 一治一亂하고 一盛一衰함은 史에 徵하야도 明瞭하나니 此를 推하면 世界란 寧히 循環뿐이라 할지언정 엇지 進化뿐이라 云하리오. 그러나 그는 近視眼의 短距離를 觀察함에 不過하리니 大抵 治亂盛衰는 모다 進化上 過程에 橫在한 사실인 따름이라. *하야 山勢의 搆造를 看하라. 平地의 過挾이 有한 後에 반듯이 奇峰의 突兀함을 作하얏스며 또한 水流의 淺深을 驗하라. 急灘이 有한 後에 반듯이 深川을 成하얏나니 엇지 一時一時로써 眞理의 全面을 無視할 바리오. 다만 木巢 食實과 飛機潛航만으로도 進化의 原則을 證함에 足하지 안이한가.
是點에서 觀하면 物이 物에서 開闢하고 時-時에서 開闢함이 또한 何疑가 有하리오. 從하야 太初에 在한 子 開丑闢으로 論할지라도 太初의 以上 太初에서 또한 開闢의 準備가 有하얏슬 것을 可히 推察하리로다.
嗚呼라. 宇宙의 自然은 자주 開闢하나니라. 同時에 自然의 輪轉機는 자꾸 進行하나니라. 吾人이어 此機上에 坐在하야서 엇지 進化에 逆行할 수 잇스며 開闢에 順*치 안이 할＜41＞ 수 잇스리오. 人生의 要望은 恒常 向上을 目的함에 딸아서 軒轅의 指南이 能히 蚩尤의 頑額을 壓縮하얏스며 獨砲 42珊이 韋言人道 2字에 屈服됨이 안인가.
潢池弄兵은 先天에 已屬하얏도다. 從하야 自然의 開闢 順序도 또한 그 方向을 異히 하리로다. 古에는 人을 殺하기 善함으로써 强者이며 覇者가 되엇고 今에는 人을 活하기 善함으로써 優者이며 勝者가 된 것이니 此로써 証하건대 天道敎祖의 先天 開闢과 後天 開闢을 兩段으로 解說함이 또한 適切하도다.
黑夜深更에 頑雲이 千丈萬丈을 起立하고 또한 寒風凄雨가 左旅右倒할제 耳不能, 目不能하고 다만 一點殘燈이 明滅한 中에서 氷水와 煨栗을 飮嚼할 而已러니 何幸地球公轉의 原動力에 因하야 東窓에 曙日을 迎하얏나니 此가 卽 大戰 後 神의 新聲이 안이며 新은 즉 新한 大開闢이 안인가.
開闢君이어. 爾聲이 旣히 正義에 順하고 爾生이 또한 時代에 適하얏스니 果然 偉하고 大하도다. 余-엇지 祝치 안이하며 擧世-엇지 歡迎치 안이하리오. 다만 歡喜의 餘에 一語를 更寄하노니 君은 彼汀渚의 鵝를 觀하라. 그의 長頸巨翼이 一聲大呼함은 快壯하나 그의 步武가 至鈍且鈍함은 可憎하나니 君은 此에 自警하야 반듯이 聲에 相副한 健步를 濶踏할지어다.＜42＞
