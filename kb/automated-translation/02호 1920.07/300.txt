The Woodcutters and the Buddha

Two woodcutters went up a mountain to cut wood. One lad lost his axe and couldn't find it, so he went to the nearby temple to pray to the Buddha and ask him to find it for him. Several lads were heading towards that temple when, midway, they encountered several monks from that temple coming down. The woodcutters asked where they were going. The monks replied, "Last night, a thief entered the temple and we lost the Buddhist ritual vessels (佛器), so we are going to the magistrate (원님) to ask him to find them."

Hearing this, the woodcutter who had lost his axe said, "How could a Buddha who cannot even find the vessels lost from his own temple find someone else's axe?" And they parted ways and went on.＜109＞

**Summary**

This short anecdote tells of woodcutters who encounter monks reporting a theft from their temple to the magistrate. One woodcutter, who was initially going to pray to Buddha to find his lost axe, realizes the irony and expresses skepticism about Buddha's power, concluding that if Buddha couldn't prevent his own temple's valuables from being stolen or find them, he certainly couldn't help find a lost axe. From a historical perspective, this piece subtly reflects folk skepticism towards religious or established institutions during the colonial period. It might hint at a questioning of traditional authority or beliefs, possibly resonating with the broader social changes and questioning spirit fostered by publications like *Kaebyŏk* itself, presented in the vernacular language with older spellings characteristic of the era.
