洪水中龍山 (Yongsan Amidst the Flood)

濁流亂入近江村 新舊龍山失半分 水族來占入住處 可憐誰作魚腹魂
Muddy currents wildly flow into the riverside village,
New and Old Yongsan have lost half.
Water creatures come to occupy the places where people lived,
Alas, who has become a spirit in a fish's belly?

其二 (Part 2)

千家半入水宮中 失所人情彼此同 連日飢寒元氣尽 一時溫飽亦爲功
Half of a thousand homes are submerged in the water palace,
The feelings of the displaced are mutual.
Consecutive days of hunger and cold exhaust vitality,
Even temporary warmth and fullness are a great relief.

其三 (Part 3)

女哭兒啼夜不休 仁人到此那無憂 各社救濟同時起 化裡德波四面流
Women weep, children cry, ceasing not through the night,
How could benevolent people arrive here and not feel sorrow?
Relief efforts from various societies arise simultaneously,
Within this transformation, waves of virtue flow in all directions.

大神一氣化爲千 敎本無私覺後先 長生呪誦十三字 无極運開五萬年
The Great Spirit's one energy transforms into thousands,
Teachings are fundamentally selfless; awakening happens sooner or later.
Chanting the thirteen characters of the long life incantation,
The boundless fortune opens for fifty thousand years.
曲曲淵深魚出躍 枝枝花發蹀來眼 東窓西戶家非二 人在中央統四邊＜130＞
In every deep pool, fish leap out,
On every branch, flowers bloom, drawing the skipping eye.
East window, west door – the house is not two,
Humankind stands in the center, unifying the four directions.<130>
<129-130>

**Summary**

These four Hanja poems by Min Yŏngsun describe the devastation caused by a flood in Yongsan (Seoul) in 1920 and the subsequent relief efforts. The first three poems vividly depict the destruction, the suffering of the displaced people (hunger, cold, loss), and the compassionate response from relief organizations. The final poem shifts to a spiritual theme, addressed to various religious groups (possibly referencing Ch'ŏndogyo or related faiths via 'Yongt'aek Yŏnwŏn'), presenting a cosmology of universal energy, selfless teaching, and the promise of long life and boundless fortune, ending with an image of universal harmony centered on humanity.

For historians, the poems offer a contemporary account of a natural disaster and social response in colonial Korea. They highlight the suffering caused by the flood, the organized relief efforts by various societal groups ("各社救濟"), and connect this event to the broader spiritual and potentially nationalistic sentiments circulating within groups like Ch'ŏndogyo, which published *Kaebyŏk*. The final poem's specific references (13-character chant, 50,000-year fortune) point to particular religious beliefs prominent at the time, reflecting how disaster could be interpreted through existing spiritual frameworks.
