A Glimpse at the Modern Working-Class Movement
						Yi Chun-sŏk

Since the differentiation of classes arose in society, it has been a principle, regardless of the era, that social evolution and cultural development are determined by the class structure of that time. Generally, within the class structure, the formation of overt 'us vs. them' dynamics and some form of suppression and suffering (抑壓 呻吟) are naturally included. Therefore, as long as society has a class-based structure, some degree of class struggle is an utterly unavoidable fact in any era.

When, among all the classes dominated by a certain class within the conventional social structure, the actual power of another group gradually develops and contends for the position of the ruling class, achieving superiority, that is what can be called a specific era of class struggle. This era can be called a transitional period when social evolution and cultural development are redirected. Looking at the present day, then, it must be called the most significant transitional period in recorded history for social evolution and cultural development. Is it not a natural instance that the ideology of class struggle greatly gains momentum? It is hardly surprising; this is the reason why the modern working-class movement develops ever more vigorously, becoming a major global issue.

The class struggles of previous eras saw the bourgeois class overwhelming the aristocratic class whenever revolutionary movements arose. This was the struggle of the bourgeoisie against the aristocracy, inherently possessing a political nature. However, the class struggle of the modern era differs from this; it is the struggle of the working class against the bourgeois class, inherently possessing an economic nature. While the struggles of previous eras were confined to a single region or a single nation, the modern struggle shows signs of sweeping overwhelmingly across the entire world's thought. Therefore, the result of struggles in previous eras was merely the establishment of partial political rights, whereas the current state of struggle aims to establish worldwide economic rights. In other words, while the bourgeoisie seeks to firmly maintain its economic privileges under the current private property system and the substantial political privileges based thereon, the working class aims to reform or completely abolish the private property system, thereby destroying the economic and consequent political privileges of the bourgeoisie. This can be called the distinctive feature of modern class struggle. The holding of the International Labour Conference (國際 勞働會議) and the prevalence of Social Democratic Parties (社會民黨) in various countries are current facts, leaving no time for further elaboration. However, arguing from my perspective, the current working-class movement should not be regarded merely as a movement of the working class alone. It must be called a great self-aware movement of the masses, driven by the grand trend that will erase the old culture and create a new continent. Therefore, it is not merely a problem for the workers themselves, but rather a major public issue for the world.

Alas! To what state is the ideology of class struggle gradually evolving now? How will the situation likely change henceforth? Regarding this, I would rather remain silent. <88>

**Summary**

This article by Yi Chun-sŏk posits that class struggle is an inherent aspect of society's evolution. It contrasts past political class struggles (bourgeoisie vs. aristocracy) with the contemporary struggle (working class vs. bourgeoisie), characterizing the latter as fundamentally economic, global in scale, and aimed at dismantling the private property system and its associated privileges. The author views the modern labor movement not just as a workers' issue but as a profound, mass-driven force signalling a major historical transition and the creation of a new era, surpassing previous conflicts in scope and significance. For historians of colonial Korea, this 1920 article is significant as an early example of Korean intellectual engagement with international socialist thought and class analysis. It reflects the introduction and adaptation of Marxist concepts like class struggle, bourgeoisie, and proletariat into the Korean discourse shortly after the March 1st Movement, indicating a search for new frameworks to understand Korea's situation and the wider world, framing global labor movements as a potentially transformative force.

現代勞働階級의 運動瞥見
						李駿錫
社會에 階級의 差別이 生한 後에는 社會의 進化와 文化의 發展은 何 時代를 勿論하고 그 時代에 對한 階級組織으로부터 決定됨이 原則이라. 大抵 階級組織의 中에는 露骨的 彼我의 形成과 或 意味의 抑壓 呻吟이 自然的 包含되어 잇는 故로 社會가 階級的 組織이 된 以上에는 何 時代이던지 或 程度의 階級鬪爭은 到底히 避치 못할 事實이라.
從來 社會組織에 對하야 一定한 階級에 支配되어 잇는 모든 階級中에서 或者의 實力이 漸漸 發達하야 支配階級의 地位를 爭하야 優越되는 時는 곳 階級鬪爭의 特定時代라 謂할지며 此時代는 社會의 進化와 文化의 發展이 挽回되는 轉移時期라 謂할지라. 그러면 現代로 論한즉 社會進化와 文化發展이 有史以來 最重大한 移轉期라 謂치 아니치 못할지라. 階級鬪爭思想이 勢力을 大振함은 當然한 事例가 아닌가. 足히 怪치 못할지니 此는 현대 勞働階級의 運動이 益益 發達하야 世界的 大問題가 되는 所以로다.
前代의 階級鬪爭은 革命運動이 起할 時마다 資産者 階級이 貴族階級을 壓倒하니 此는 貴族階級에 대한 資産階級의 鬪爭인즉 本來 政治的 性質이 有한 者이어니와 現代의 階級鬪爭은 此와 異하야 資産階級에 對한 勞働階級의 鬪爭인즉 本來 經濟的 性質이 有한 者이라. 前代의 鬪爭은 一部落 一國家에 止할뿐이어니와 現代에는 全世界 思想을 擧하야 淊淊 風靡할 觀이 업지 아니한지라. 故로 前代의 鬪爭한 結果는 一部分的 政治 權利를 確立함에 不過하얏거니와 現代의 鬪爭한 形勢는 全世界的 經濟 權利를 確立코저 함이라. 換言하면 資産階級은 現在 私有財産制度下에서 經濟的 特權과 及 此에 基한 實質上의 政治的 特權을 固持코저 함에 反하야 勞動階級은 私有財産制度를 改造 或 全廢하야 資産階級의 經濟特權과 此에 基한 政治的 特權까지 破壞코저 함이 卽 現代 階級鬪爭의 特質이라 謂할지로다. 國際 勞働會議의 開催와 各國 社會民黨의 跋扈는 現在의 事實인즉 更히 叙論키 不遑하거니와 余의 見한 바로 論할진대 現今에 勞動階級의 運動은 單純히 勞動階級의 運動으로만 看做할 者-아니오. 舊 文化를 抹消하고 新大陸을 創造할 大氣運에 依하야 民衆의 自覺的 大運動이라 謂치 아니치 못할지라. 그러면 勞働者 自身 問題가 아니오. 卽 世界 公共的 大問題이로다.
噫라. 階級鬪爭思想이 今에 漸漸 何境까지 化去하나뇨. 今後의 形勢가 將次 如何히 變動되겟나뇨. 此에 對하야 寧히 無言코저 하노라.＜88＞
