Eternal Loyalty = Master Yi Sun-sin, Introduction to the Ten Great Men, Part Nine
						One Reporter
Foreword

During the 500 years of the Yi Dynasty (Chosŏn), there were of course numerous foreign invasions, but the Japanese Invasion of Imjin (332 years ago from now) and the Manchu Invasion of Pyŏngja (288 years ago from now) can be said to be the most notable among them. Especially, the Imjin War was truly a catastrophe unprecedented in the 4,000 years [of Korean history], considering points such as the affected area covering almost the entire territory of Chosŏn, its duration extending to seven long years, and the fact that 220,000 foreign troops (Ming forces) were requested.
However, what was the situation in Chosŏn at that time, facing such a catastrophe? Since the ascension of Yi T'aejo, 200 years of peace had passed; the people did not know of soldiery, and officials esteemed only authority, leading to negligence from top to bottom. Reaching the year Ŭrhae of King Sŏnjo's 8th year, the maternal relative Sim Ŭi-gyŏm (West) and the Confucian official Kim Hyo-wŏn (East) started a rift over a trivial matter, beginning the East-West factional division. All officials in the court quickly fell into being designated as either East or West. Anyone even slightly related to Kim Hyo-wŏn's group was pointed out as East, and anyone related to Sim Ŭi-gyŏm's group was marked as West, leaving no impartial person in the royal court.
The result was mutual exclusion and mutual suspicion; besides knowing factional strife existed, they did not know that state affairs existed. If some patriotic scholar transcended this and discussed statecraft, the entire court would persecute him, leaving him no place to stand. Although there were good ministers and famous officials like Yi I, Yi Hang-bok, Yi Tŏk-hyŏng, Yu Sŏng-nyong, <49> Paek In-gŏl, and others, they could not unfold their ambitions. Amidst fruitless struggles, the unprecedented catastrophe arrived.
In the summer of the 4th month of the 25th year of King Sŏnjo, Imjin (1592), Japan's Toyotomi Hideyoshi invaded with a large army of about 150,000. As there were no preparations made in peacetime, the three capitals fell, and the various counties collapsed like earth crumbling. The royal procession fled westward, and the peril to the state and ancestral shrine was truly like stacked eggs. Afterwards, righteous armies (ŭibyŏng) rose up greatly, and Ming forces came to aid, restoring the homeland from devastation and propping up the great house that was already falling.
However, amidst such a chaotic situation, there was a great man of passionate loyalty and righteousness, whose fame was outstanding. He foresaw the impending great war, calmly devoted himself to preparations, and when the situation unfolded, he showed not the slightest panic, achieved victory in a hundred battles, annihilated the enemy's main force in the Southern Sea, and restored the kingdom's authority to be heavier than the Nine Tripods (九鼎). According to public opinion, that man is Master Yi Sun-sin, the Chungmugong (Lord of Loyal Valor).

The Master Before Imjin

The Master's courtesy name was Yŏhae (汝諧), his clan origin was Tŏksu (德水), Sunsin (舜臣) was his given name, and Chungmu (忠武) was his posthumous title. He was born 377 years ago from now, on the 8th day of the 3rd month of the 1st year of King Myŏngjong, Ŭlmi (1545), in Kŏnch'ŏn-dong, Hansŏng (Seoul). His great-grandfather "Kŏ" (琚) served during the reigns of both King Sŏngjong and Yŏnsan-gun; as an official of the Office of the Inspector-General (臺官), his impeachments were stern and just, earning him the nickname "Tiger Changnyŏng" (虎掌令). His grandfather "Paengnok" (百祿) and father "Chŏng" (貞) were also Confucian officials renowned at the time, so his family lineage was quite upright.
From childhood, the Master was brilliant and unrestrained. When playing with other children, he always simulated battle formations and made himself the commander-in-chief. If he observed any unpleasant matter in the neighborhood, he would immediately reprimand it, causing the neighbors to hold him in awe. As he gradually grew up, he became modest, respectful, and reserved. When reading books, he quickly grasped the great principles, but deeming this insufficient, he turned to practicing martial arts. His horsemanship and archery were outstanding, astonishing his peers. Although he associated with military men, he remained noble, quiet, and reserved, not uttering unnecessary words, which made his companions respect and fear him. In the spring of Pyŏngja (at age 33) [actually 32 by Western count, 1576], he passed the military examination (武科) and in the winter of the same year became the Kwon'gwan (權管, junior military official) of Tonggubip'o in Hamgyŏng Province. After four years, in Kimyo, he returned to serve in the Hunryŏnwŏn (訓鍊院, Military Training Command). Later, in Kyŏngjin (1580), he became the Manho (萬戶, commander of 10,000 households, a local military rank) of Palp'o, but being always upright and unbending, he was soon dismissed. In the autumn of Kyemi (1583), he became the military adjutant (軍官) to the Southern Provincial Army Commander (南兵使) Yi Ong, and in the winter of that year, he was again reassigned as the Kwon'gwan of Kŏnwŏn. Despite his merit in capturing the Jurchen chieftain Ullijinae (鬱只乃) alive and pacifying the border tribes (藩胡),<50> Army Commander (兵使) Kim U-sŏ, jealous of the Master's independent success, conversely requested his punishment on the grounds of acting arbitrarily with troops (擅兵), but this did not succeed. In the winter of that year, he suffered his father's death. In the spring of Pyŏngsul (1586), he was promoted back to Chobusan Manho via the post of Saboksichububo (司僕寺主簿, Junior sixth rank official in charge of horses/carriages). In the autumn of Chŏnghae (1587), he concurrently held the position of Tunchŏn'gwan (屯田官, official managing military fields) of Noktun Island. Concerned about the island's isolation and small garrison, the Master repeatedly requested reinforcements from Army Commander Yi Il (李鎰), but he was ignored. In the 8th month of that year, the Jurchens indeed invaded in large force. The Master managed to repel them with great difficulty, but was hit by a stray arrow, injuring his left arm. Army Commander Yi Il, wanting to silence the Master to avoid his own culpability, had the Master brought in and intended to subject him to capital punishment. However, the Master calmly stated the facts without changing his expression or tone. Il could do nothing and reported to the court, resulting in the Master being punished with paegŭijonggun (白衣從軍, serving in the army as a common soldier without rank). Afterwards, he served successively as a military official in Chŏlla Province, Magistrate (縣監) of Chŏngŭp, Ch'ŏmsa (僉使, naval rank) of Manp'o, Magistrate (郡守) of Chindo, and Ch'ŏmsa of Karip'o. In the 2nd month of Sinmyo (1591), he was appointed Naval Commander of the Chŏlla Left Province (全羅左道 水軍節度使). The opportunity for the Master to exert his body and mind for the state and family had thus arrived.

The Imjin War and the Master

From the day after taking office, the Master, concerned about the imminent foreign invasion, dedicated himself daily to strengthening defenses. He forged weapons, cast iron chains, first blockaded the naval base entrance and harbors, and created the famous Turtle Ship (龜船) to prepare for assault tactics.
In the 4th month of Imjin (1592), Japanese forces arrived in great numbers, first capturing Pusan and Tongnae, then advancing towards the capital via the Yŏngnam region. The Master intended to move his troops to attack, but his subordinate generals were all reluctant to leave their base and go to another province. The Master promptly spurred the generals using military discipline. In early May, he went to Tangp'o and met with Kyŏngsang Right Naval Commander Wŏn Kyun. At that time, Kyun had suffered a major defeat by the Japanese forces, losing over 70 warships, and was requesting the Master's aid. He immediately joined forces with Wŏn Kyun's remaining troops. In the first engagement at Okp'o (王浦, likely Okp'o 玉浦), they destroyed over 30 enemy ships. At the end of the same month, they pursued the enemy further to Sach'ŏn and burned and destroyed 13 ships. On this day, the Master was also hit by a bullet, injuring his left shoulder, but he continued directing the battle all day. Only after the battle ended did the army realize this. In early June, he encountered the enemy at Tangp'o, shot and killed their commander. Five days later, he joined forces with Chŏlla Right Naval Commander Yi Ŏk-ki, smashed 32 ships, and shot their commander, greatly boosting the army's morale. For this achievement, he was promoted to Chasŏn taebu (資憲大夫, Senior second rank). In early July, hearing that the enemy was again heading towards Honam (Chŏlla) from Yangsan, he advanced his forces to Kyŏnnaeryang near Kosŏng. The enemy indeed came with about 30 ships in the vanguard, followed by countless warships covering the sea. The Master then feigned retreat, luring the enemy to the <51> open sea before Hansan Island, then counterattacked and achieved a great victory, destroying all 73 enemy ships and slaughtering nearly 10,000 soldiers and officers, turning the sea red. This is what the world calls the Great Victory of Hansan (閑山大捷). For this achievement, he was promoted to Chŏnghŏn taebu (正憲大夫, Senior first rank).
Immediately after the Battle of Hansan, he again engaged the enemy at Angolp'o, burning and destroying 42 ships. In September of the same year, the Master, along with Wŏn Kyun, Yi Ŏk-ki, and others, decided to advance on the enemy at Pusan to destroy their base (巢穴). They sortied to Pusan, but the Japanese soldiers, fearing his might, dared not come out, only firing projectiles from high ground. Therefore, they burned over 100 empty ships and returned.
Later, in July of Kyesa (1593), he moved his main camp to Hansan Island and further improved war preparations. In August of the same year, the royal court specially appointed the Master as the Supreme Commander of the Naval Forces of the Three Provinces (三道水軍統制使) (Kyŏngsang, Ch'ungch'ŏng, Chŏlla), putting him in command of the navies of all three provinces. This was because the Master's great fame was highly regarded at court (廟堂).

"Tried to be loyal to the country, yet punishment has come; Tried to repay parents, yet parents too have passed away."

Is it inevitable, as they say, that a tall tree attracts the wind? The Master also could not escape this rule. Specifically, Kyŏngsang Naval Commander Wŏn Kyun, not reflecting on his own lack of merit, merely resented being placed under the Master and intrigued against him in a hundred ways. The Master, understanding his feelings, treated him leniently daily, but Kyun's nature was violent and undisciplined, and he did not follow orders. Fearing this would harm the greater cause, the Master reported the facts to the court, which then transferred Kyun to be the Army Commander of Ch'ungch'ŏng Province. From this point, Kyun resented the Master even more and conspired with court nobles to frame him. Just at this time, Japanese generals Yukinaga [Konishi] and Kiyomasa [Katō], wary of the Master's great fame, decided to use spies (反間) to eliminate him. First, they had Yashiro (要時羅), a subordinate of Yukinaga, come to the camp of Kyŏngsang Army Commander Kim Ung-sŏ to feign a request for peace talks. The court, seeking the return of the princes captured earlier, ordered discussions on the matter. One day, Yashiro secretly told Kim, "The failure to achieve peace now is entirely due to Kiyomasa. I deeply detest him. He will cross a certain sea on a certain day. How about taking this opportunity to eliminate him?" Ung-sŏ reported this to the court, and the court ordered the Master to handle it. However, the Master, believing the enemy's crafty words could not be trusted, ultimately did not go. Censors and advisors (臺諫) in the government, influenced by Wŏn Kyun, argued that this opportunity should be seized and submitted memorials impeaching the Master for the crime of <52> hesitation (逗遛). Although Yi Wŏn-ik and Yu Sŏng-nyong strongly argued against it, the King again dispatched a royal attendant to investigate the facts. The attendant, also siding with Kyun, falsely reported the situation. In the 2nd month of Chŏngyu (1597), the Master was finally arrested and interrogated in the capital, stripped of his position, and specially pardoned but ordered to serve as a common soldier (白衣從軍).
Prior to this, when the Master received the arrest warrant and was heading towards Hansŏng, the soldiers and civilians along the entire route crowded around him, weeping and not knowing what to do. In the 4th month of the same year, when he received the sentence of paegŭijonggun and subsequently faced his mother's death, the Master prostrated himself and cried bitterly, saying, "Tried to be loyal to the country (竭忠於國), yet punishment has come (罪已至); Tried to repay parents (欲報於親), yet parents too have passed away (親亦亡)." People near and far lamented this. Afterwards, Wŏn Kyun, replacing the Master, was soon defeated and killed. When the court reinstated the Master, refugees and civilians, upon seeing him, all said, "From now on, we will not die," and the entire region was consequently recovered.

A General's Star Falls into the Sea Clouds at Dawn

In the 8th month of Chŏngyu (1597), the Master became Supreme Commander again. He immediately rushed into the Sunch'ŏn area, gathered about 10 warships and several hundred scattered soldiers, and defeated the enemy at Nando Island. At this time, the court, concerned about the Master's small force and weak position, advised him to abandon the sea and fight on land. But the Master replied, writing, "Since the Imjin year, the enemy has not dared to invade the south because the navy has obstructed their advance. If the navy is withdrawn now, the enemy will surely reach Hansŏng via Honam." He did not comply. In September of the same year, with merely a dozen warships, he intercepted over 330 enemy ships at Pyŏkp'ajŏng below Chindo Island, cut down their commander, and smashed over 30 of their ships, reviving the military's reputation. The court intended to reward this achievement, but it did not happen due to obstruction by detractors. In the spring of Musul (1598), he moved the main base to Kogŭm Island in Kangjin and implemented military farming (屯耕) to prepare for a protracted war. In the autumn of the same year, Ming General Chen Lin (陳璘) arrived with 5,000 naval troops to join forces with the Master. Chen's nature was fierce and arrogant (悍驁), and furthermore, priding himself on being a general of the Heavenly Army (天兵, i.e., Ming forces), his haughtiness (驕傲) was unparalleled. However, the Master treated him with courtesy and addressed him with straightforward words. Not only General Chen but also his subordinate officers and soldiers dared not commit even the slightest misconduct. Chen was particularly impressed by the Master's handling of troops and strategy against the enemy. When lying ill in his camp, he delegated all command authority to the Master and accepted his direction. When referring to the Master, he always called him "Master Yi" (李爺), never using his name. When writing to King Sŏnjo, he praised the Master, saying he possessed the talent to order heaven and weave the earth (經天緯地) and the merit to mend heaven and bathe the sun (補天浴日). Furthermore, <53> he reported this to the Ming Emperor, requesting that a Commander's Seal (都督印) be specially granted to the Master. This was because he was wholeheartedly impressed by the Master's capacity and virtue.

Now, turning back, from the year Imjin to the year Musul, a span of seven years had passed. Although the Japanese forces initially achieved victories everywhere, later, due to the rise of the righteous armies and the arrival of Ming reinforcements, they suffered惨败 (miserable defeats) 8 or 9 times out of 10, and their army was halved. Furthermore, by the autumn of Musul, the Regent (關白) Toyotomi Hideyoshi had died, and his generals vied for power. Hearing this, generals like Yukinaga [Konishi] and Yoshihiro [Shimazu] desperately wished to return home (歸心如矢, hearts set on returning like arrows) and constantly sought ways to withdraw and return to their country. However, with Ming General Liu Ting's (劉綎) large army on land and the strong forces of Yi Sun-sin and Chen Lin at sea, they could find no way out and worried day and night. Ultimately, they bribed Liu Ting on land, begging for peace, and also sent lavish gifts of swords, goods, pork, and wine (刀貨와 猪酒) to Chen Lin at sea, begging for passage home. Chen was also swayed by the bribe and intended to permit it, but the Master forcefully argued against it, and the matter failed. Yukinaga, learning of this and facing stern rejection everywhere, became filled with rage (忿氣撑中) and decided to call upon the forces from Sach'ŏn to muster a final, desperate effort. The Sach'ŏn forces were soldiers from Satsuma (薩州) province, known for being fierce, brave, and invincible. On the evening of the 18th day of the 11th month of Musul (December 16, 1598), the forces of Yukinaga and Yoshihiro arrived from the Southern Sea and anchored at Ommokp'o and Kyŏngnyang. Their numbers were immense, with nearly 500 warships alone. That night, the Master, together with Chen Lin, sortied their forces and encountered the enemy at Noryang. They fought intermittently, resting and engaging. The enemy's strength was considerable, and victory could not be easily decided. Around dawn on the 19th, entering a major fire attack phase together with the Ming forces, just as the sounds of battle reached a crescendo, the Master was struck by a stray bullet and fell inside the ship. His last words were, "The battle is now urgent; take care not to reveal my death." He then passed away (at age 54). His eldest son Hoe (薈) and nephew Wan (莞) received his dying wish, concealed the Master's body in a cabin, and continued waving the command flag as before. They routed the surrounding enemy, advanced to rescue Chen Lin's ship from encirclement, and ended the battle as Yukinaga and Yoshihiro escaped. When the battle concluded, Chen Lin steered his ship close to the Master's, intending to thank him for his efforts, only to find that the Master had already passed away. Admiral Chen collapsed on the deck three times and cried out loudly, "From now on, with whom shall I discuss great matters?" The entire army wept in unison, and even the Ming soldiers threw down their weapons (肉을 投하엿스며 - perhaps 'threw themselves down' or 'cast aside their rations' in grief). As the funeral bier left Kogŭm Island to return to Asan, the old and young, men and women along the entire route followed, weeping. The royal court dispatched ritual officials to bestow rites and posthumously appointed him Right State Councilor (右議政). Various high officials of the time sent eulogies (輓歌) and memorial writings (祭文) to bid farewell to the Master. This day was the 11th day of the 2nd month of the following year, Kihae (1599). He was buried <54> at the northern foot of Nadang Mountain in Asan.
At that time and in later generations, numerous shrines were built and memorial stones erected in admiration of the Master's great merits and noble character. Examples include: Chungnyŏlsa (忠烈祠, Shrine of Loyal Fierceness - one in Noryang, Namhae County; one west of Sebyŏnggwan Hall in the T'ongjeyŏng naval headquarters), Hyŏnch'ungsa (顯忠祠, Shrine of Manifest Loyalty - 20 li east of Asan County), Yusa (遺祠, Memorial Shrine - on Kogŭm Island, Kangjin), Yimyo (遺廟, Memorial Temple - inside Kŏje Castle), Chungminsa (忠愍祠, Shrine of Loyal Compassion - in Sunch'ŏn), Chungmusa (忠武祠, Shrine of Loyal Valor - in Haenam), Wŏlsansa (月山祠, Wŏlsan Shrine - in Hamp'yŏng), Yuaesa (遺愛祠, Shrine of Lingering Affection - in Chŏngŭp), Chunghyodang (忠孝堂, Hall of Loyalty and Filial Piety - in Onyang), Ch'omyo (草廟, Grass Shrine - at Changnyang, Kŏje), etc. These are the main ones. Later, in Kapchin (1604), when the court discussed the merits of the Imjin War, the Master was ranked first, and bestowed the title Hyoch'ungchang'ŭi Togyŏkhyŏmnyŏk Sŏnmu Kongsin (効忠仗義 迪毅協力 宣武功臣 - Merit Subject who Rendered Loyalty, Upheld Righteousness, Advanced Resolutely, Cooperated Harmoniously, and Proclaimed Military Virtue). I will conclude this section by showing a few stanzas from memorial poems for the Master written by Minister Yi Su-gwang and Chief State Councilor Yu Sŏng-nyong.

Elegy for Supreme Commander Yi (輓李統制)

By Yi Su-gwang (李睟光)

Your awesome fame long terrified the sheep-like barbarians (犬羊羣),
World-covering, wondrous merit, known throughout the realm (天下聞).
Barbarian miasma cleared at night by the moon beyond the lake (湖外月),
A general's star fell at dawn into the clouds amidst the sea (海中雲).
The waves have yet to vent the hero's Côn (英雄恨),
Bamboo slips and silk scrolls in vain record the merits of battle (戰伐勳).
How many true men are there today (今日男兒知幾個)?
Pitiable indeed, the loyal and righteous General Yi (忠義李將軍).

Lamenting Supreme Commander Yi (哀李統制)

By Yu Sŏng-nyong (柳成龍)

Hansan Island, Kogŭm Island (閒山島古今島),
In the great sea, a few specks of blue (大海之中數點碧).
General Yi, who fought a hundred battles then (當時百戰李將軍),
Single-handedly propped up half the heavens (隻手親扶天半壁).
Slaughtered whale-calves (鯨兒, i.e., Japanese) till blood stained the waves (血殷波),
Raging fires burned down the pirates' dens (溤夷窟).
High merit couldn't escape slander and jealousy's grasp (讒妬摳構),
A life light as goose feather (鴻毛), what worth regretting (安足惜)?
Haven't you seen the stone slab east of Hyŏnsan mountain (峴山東頭一片石)?
After Master Yang [Hu] left, people shed tears (羊公去後人垂泣).
Desolate, the few rooms of the Minch'ung Shrine (愍忠祠),
Wind and rain year after year... [eight characters missing in original text] ... unrepaired (不修),
Sometimes, dragonflies (蜓戶, likely typo for something else, or symbolic?) cry with muffled sobs (呑聲哭).

A Life Obscure, Unrecognized by the World for Half a Century

The Master's character was upright and unbending. He only knew to devote his loyalty towards a fixed goal, lacking any expediency like bowing his head or bending his knee to seek undeserved <55> reputation, or scheming to avoid future troubles. The examples shown below illustrate this.
Yu Sŏae (Yu Sŏng-nyong's pen name) and the Master were close friends from childhood. Minister of War Yi Yulgok (Yi I's pen name) once heard of the Master's character and wished to meet him through Sŏae. The Master replied, "I am of the same clan as Yulgok. Righteously, we should be close, but I cannot visit him while he is the Chief State Councilor (全相)," and ultimately did not go. When the Master was in a low position at the Hunryŏnwŏn (Military Training Command), Minister of War Kim Kwi-yŏng wanted to make his daughter born of a concubine (庶産女) the Master's concubine. But the Master said, "To attach myself to a powerful house upon first entering public service is not my aspiration," and sternly rejected the matchmaker. Around Kyŏngjin (1580), when he was the Manho of Palp'o, his superior, Left Naval Commander Sŏng Pak, dispatched someone to the post to cut down a Paulownia tree (桐木) in the guest house courtyard to make a geomungo (琴). The Master refused, saying, "This is public property of the government office (官家). There must have been a reason for planting it; how could there be no reason needed for cutting it down?" The Naval Commander was furious but ultimately could not take it. Around Kich'uk (1589), Cho Tae-jung was arrested for treason. During the confiscation of Cho's belongings, letters from the Master were found among them. Friends, concerned for the Master, secretly tried to remove them, but the Master stopped them, saying, "I merely exchanged letters inquiring after his health. How could I remove them and engage in private dealings?" His friends admired the Master's magnanimity. He often said, "A true man (大丈夫), born into the world, if employed, should offer his life; if not employed, tilling the fields is sufficient. To present flattery to the world and steal temporary glory is something I am ashamed of." He also said, "For a general in chaotic times to have even the slightest thought of seeking merit is not true loyalty. If I die on the day the enemy retreats, I will have no regrets." Indeed, just as he said, he died a martyr's death at Noryang on the very day the enemy retreated. How fervent was his heart!

Where Life is Held Lighter Than a Goose Feather, Death is Always Glorious

"Where life is held lighter than a goose feather, death is always glorious (鴻毛輕處死常榮)" is a line from Yi Kae's farewell poem. The Master's way of facing difficult situations was always like this.
During the Noktun Island incident, when Army Commander Yi Il tried to falsely accuse and kill the Master, his colleague Sŏn Kŏ-i wept and advised the Master, saying, "Drink some wine to calm your heart." The Master replied, "Life and death are destined; why drink wine?" Kŏ-i said, "Even if you don't drink wine, can you perhaps drink water?" The Master said, "I am not thirsty now; why must I drink water?" and faced Yi Il's interrogation just like that. In the year Chŏngyu (1597), when he was arrested and taken to the capital due to Wŏn Kyun's false accusations, friends cautiously <56> told him, "The King's anger is extreme, and the court's opinion is severe; the situation is unpredictable. What are your thoughts?" The Master simply said, "If they kill me, I will die." When interrogated about his alleged crimes, he only laid out the sequence of events clearly and did not implicate others, which earned the admiration of the entire court. Just before starting the Noryang campaign, Ming Admiral Chen Lin, having accepted bribes from the enemy, intended to let Yukinaga escape and strongly insisted on attacking the enemy at Namhae instead. The Master refused this. Chen Lin persisted, finally placing his hand on his sword and saying, "The Emperor gave me this long sword!" The Master remained perfectly calm (晏然) and said, "One death is hardly worth regretting, but as the Commander-in-Chief, I absolutely cannot let the retreating enemy go free," thus changing Chen's mind. Such was the Master's resolute spirit.

Upholding the Law, Maintaining Justice, Without the Slightest Leniency

When the Master held office, he always upheld the law and maintained justice; his orders were strict and clear, allowing no leniency whatsoever. While stationed at Hansan Island, Ming General Chen Lin's soldiers frequently engaged in looting, causing hardship to the common people. One day, the Master ordered all large and small barracks in the camp to be dismantled and moved his own bedding onto his ship. Chen Lin saw this, found it strange, and sent a subordinate to inquire. The Master replied, "The soldiers and people of Chosŏn look up to the Heavenly Army (Ming forces) as they would their parents. Yet the Heavenly Army disregards this and loots wantonly, causing the good people to flee. As the Commander-in-Chief of Chosŏn, I cannot remain here alone. Therefore, I intend to float on the sea and move elsewhere." Chen Lin, greatly alarmed, rushed over, grasped the Master's hand to stop him, and thereafter entrusted the supervision of Ming troops entirely to the Master, ensuring not even the slightest misconduct occurred. Also, when he once served in the Hunryŏnwŏn (Military Training Command), his superior, a certain Bureau Director (兵部郎) in the Ministry of War, tried to promote a close relative of his to the position of Ch'amgun (參軍, military advisor/staff officer) out of turn. The Master opposed this with straightforward words, saying, "If a junior person is promoted out of turn, senior people will be held back. There is no such principle in public affairs." The Bureau Director tried to pressure him with authority but could not make him yield. Such was his imposing dignity.

Not Only Capable in Warfare, But Also Skilled in Management

The Master was not only skilled in warfare but also excelled at handling administrative affairs and managing projects. Once, holding a concurrent post, he went to T'aein County. <57> At that time, T'aein had lacked a magistrate for a long time, and official documents (簿書) had piled up. The Master adjudicated them swiftly like flowing water, finishing everything in an instant (頃刻), astonishing the bystanders. Also, when Yi Wŏn-ik, commissioned by the court, went south as the Supreme Commander of Land Forces (都體察使), countless reports were submitted from the navy, but he did not resolve them immediately. Instead, he bundled them up, visited the Master in Chinju, and had him resolve them. The Master decided them on the spot. Yi Wŏn-ik, skeptical, reviewed them and found they were all appropriate to the situation. He was again astonished and exclaimed, "How can you alone be capable of what we could not manage?" The Master simply replied, "It is because they all pertain to naval matters, so I am familiar with them through sight and hearing." Such was his swiftness in affairs and versatility as a person.
Moreover, he never forgot to manage affairs diligently. Before the war began, he prepared the Turtle Ship, enabling consecutive victories. During six years of campaigning, concerned about the lack of army provisions, he eventually initiated large-scale fishing and salt production (魚鹽) and established extensive military farms (屯田), ensuring there were no shortcomings in benefiting the state and supplying the army. Also, collecting brass (鍮) from the populace to cast firearms (火器) – every single policy and action was thoroughly meticulous (凱切).

Bending His Body, Exhausting His Efforts, Ceasing Only Upon Death

During his six years in the field, the Master completely abstained from female companionship and did not loosen his clothes or belt at night. His personal upkeep was always frugal; besides eating simple meals of several measures of rice per day, he had no other food. He invariably slept late and rose early; as soon as the rooster crowed, he would light a candle, sit up, and either review documents or deliberate on strategies. His appearance was constantly worn out. When King Sŏnjo, concerned for the Master's health, occasionally sent down delicacies (滋味), he would receive them tearfully with effort. In the year Kapo (1594), the Master contracted an illness which became quite severe, yet he did not rest for a single day and attended to duties as before. When subordinates, worried about the Master's condition, requested he rest, the Master would say, "Now we are facing the enemy, and victory or defeat is decided in a breath. Since I am not yet dead, how can I rest peacefully?" He endured the illness for 12 days. On the night of the 18th day of the 11th month of Musul (1598), when the Master faced his final destiny and engaged in the final battle, at the third watch of that night, he ascended the deck, looked up at the heavens, washed his hands, and prayed silently (盥手暗祝), saying, "If I can eliminate this enemy (此 讎), I shall have no regrets even in death." He poured out all his heart's blood. Throughout the war, he kept a daily diary. Phrases like "Sitting alone by candlelight (明燭獨坐), thinking of state affairs (念到國事), tears unknowingly fall (不覺淚下)" and "Sitting alone on the ship deck (獨坐船上), tears fall like rain (流淚雨下)" appear frequently, making even readers <58> after a thousand autumns instinctively close the book and swallow their tears. Reading writings composed by the Master, such as "Reading the History of Song (讀宋史)" and "Song of Hansan Island (閑山島吟)," one can see his heartfelt concern for the country and people leaping off the pages. Here are two or three examples of his writings:

Untitled Six Rhymes (無題六韻)

Whistling wind and rain through the night (蕭蕭風雨夜),
Restless, unable to sleep (耿耿不寐時).
Heartache like a shattered gallbladder (懷痛如摧膽),
Wounded heart as if flesh were cut (傷心似割肌).
Mountains and rivers still bear scars (山河猶帶慘),
Fish and birds also moan sadly (魚鳥亦吟悲).
The nation is in perilous straits (國有蒼黃勢),
No one to bear the burden of turning the tide (人無任轉危).
Thinking of Zhuge [Liang] for recovery (恢復思諸葛),
Yearning for [Guo] Ziyi for a long campaign (長驅慕子儀).
Years of defensive strategy planning (經年防備策),
Now become the work for the sagacious king (今作聖君斯).

Night Song on Hansan Island (閑山島夜吟)

Autumn light darkens over the water country (水國秋光暮),
Startling cold, the wild geese formation flies high (驚寒雁陣高).
Anxious heart tossing and turning through the night (憂心輾轉夜),
The waning moon illuminates bow and sword (殘月照弓刀).

Song of Hansan Island (閑山島歌)

Hansan Island, bright moonlit night (閑山島明月夜),
On the lookout tower (上戌樓),
Stroking the great sword (撫大刀), deep in sorrow (深愁時),
From somewhere, a single note of a Qiang flute deepens the sorrow (何處一聲羌笛更添愁).
Note: Cho Kyŏng-nam's Nanjung Chamnok (亂中雜錄) mentions a twenty-rhyme poem "Hansan Ŭmyŏng" (閑山吟咏), but it was scattered and lost through repeated warfare and is not extant.

Sword Inscription (劒銘)
Three-foot sword swears to Heaven (三尺誓天),
Mountains and rivers tremble in color (山河動色).

Number Two (其二)
Hand slays the whale-leviathan (手剸鯨鯢),
Spirit encompasses mountains and rivers (氣帶山河).

Untitled Couplet (無題一聯)
Swear to the sea, fish and dragons move (誓海漁龍動);
Pledge to the mountains, grass and trees know (盟山草木知). <59>

Reading the History of Song (讀宋史)

Alas! What kind of time was this, that [Zhang] Gang (綱) wanted to leave? And where would he go? Generally, when a subject serves his lord, there is death but no disloyalty. At this time, the peril to the ancestral shrine and state was like a single hair pulling a thousand jun (千鈞, immense weight). This was precisely the autumn (time) for a subject to sacrifice his body to repay the nation. The thought of leaving should certainly not sprout in the heart, let alone be uttered from the mouth! So, what should Gang have done? Disfigure himself, weep blood, bare his liver and drain his gallbladder (show utmost sincerity), clearly state the situation, that reconciliation was impossible at this point. If his words were not heeded, follow with death. If not that, then tentatively follow the plan, involve himself in it, work delicately to mend things, seek life within death, hoping perchance for a possibility of success. Gang's plan did not come to this, yet he sought to leave. How could this be the righteous way for a subject to commit himself to serving his lord?

The Master, who exemplified stern dignity and refined correctness, was on the other hand deeply benevolent towards people, always being strict with himself and generous to others. During battles, he would let the soldiers rest every night and invariably fletch arrows himself. Standing at the ship's prow, he would hold a bow and arrow himself, or beat the drum, personally facing the hail of arrows and stones. When subordinates advised the Master to take care of himself, he would just say, "You gentlemen endure arrows and stones; how can I alone rest safely planning strategy behind the curtain?" Those who heard were moved (戚然). When discord arose with Wŏn Kyun and rumors were rampant, the Master cautioned his sons and younger relatives, "If anyone asks, speak of his merits, and take care not to speak of his faults." In the 7th month of Musul (1598), when Chen Lin's forces and the Master's forces joined strength to fight, the Master's forces captured 6 ships and 69 enemy heads, whereas the Ming forces gained nothing. Chen Lin was angered by this and intended to harshly interrogate those responsible. The Master, understanding his intention, consoled Chen, saying, "Lao Ye (老爺, respectful term for Chen Lin) came as a great general of the Ming Dynasty to suppress the sea bandits together with our army. Our army's victory is Lao Ye's victory." He then gave all the captured spoils to Chen. Chen, moved by the Master's goodwill, respected and cherished the Master even more thereafter. During the Master's time as Supreme Commander, when one of his subordinates was about to face punishment, one of his sons/nephews told the Master, "This man's crime is grave; he cannot be treated leniently." The Master said, "Punishment has its own established law; it cannot be altered lightly or heavily based on someone's words. Moreover, the way of sons and nephews should rightly be to save people through the path of life; requesting severe punishment is unacceptable." The son/nephew was ashamed (赧然). The Master's second older brother had died earlier, leaving orphaned children under his care. The Master showed special affection and care for them. Though he held great military power for 11 years, he never once inquired about the marriages of his own children, yet he provided everything necessary for his nephews. Furthermore, he cherished and cared for his soldiers as if they were his own kin. Whenever he received gifts from above, he invariably distributed them among the troops. <60> When Supreme Commander Yi Wŏn-ik came south, the Master used Yi's name to provision the army himself, thereby encouraging the officers and soldiers. Whenever opportunity arose, he held memorial rites for fallen officers and soldiers, composing the eulogies himself, with wording that expressed extreme pathos and sorrow (惻恒). The memorial text for his deputy commander Chŏng Un is one example. Let me present it here:
Alas! Man's life must have death, life and death must have destiny. For a man, one death is certainly not regrettable. What makes your death uniquely lamentable is that the nation unfortunately met misfortune, the island barbarians caused calamity. The castles of Yŏngnam collapsed at the mere sight of the enemy banner; they drove deep, rolling up the land like a mat, invincible wherever they went. The capital city, in one night, became a den of heinous villains.千里 (A thousand li) west to Kuanhsi (關西), the royal carriage fled. Gazing north, the pain is long, the angry gallbladder feels torn. Alas, my incompetence, I lack the strategy to subjugate and annihilate them. Discussing difficulties with you, Sir, was like seeing the sun through parting clouds. The plan decided, swords brandished, warships linked together. Determined to die, we hung the sails, braved blades, charged first. Hundreds of Japanese slaves (倭奴) shed blood at once. Black smoke filled the sky, mournful clouds covered the eastern sun (Japan). Four times we reported victory – whose merit was this? Restoring the ancestral shrine seemed achievable soon. How could we know Heaven would not protect, and a venomous bullet would strike so suddenly? Oh, azure Heaven, its principles are indeed hard to fathom. Turning the ship to attack again, swearing to avenge the grudge. The sun setting untimely, the wind also unfavorable. Unable to achieve my wish – is there any greater pain in life than this? Thinking of this, the pain is like cut flesh. I relied on you, Sir; what more shall I do? All the generals in the camp lament endlessly. Your white-haired parent is at home; who will support them now? Holding this regret in the deep springs (underworld), when will your eyes close in peace? Alas, painful! Alas, painful! Talent not unfolded in time, position not matching virtue. Misfortune for the state, no luck for army and people. Loyalty and righteousness like yours, Sir, rare in past and present. Forgetting self for country, even in death you seem alive. Long regret in this world – who knows my heart? Containing grief, offering sincerity, remotely I pour one cup. Alas, painful!

Conclusion

Appearing in the aftermath of 200 years of peace under the Yi Dynasty, the Master lived and died with lofty spirit and fervent loyalty, without the slightest expediency. Especially during the Imjin War, the sincerity, courage, wisdom, and achievements he displayed, whether in quantity or quality, are such that even looking through all the great figures recorded in 4,000 years of history, none surpasses the Master. Only Zhuge [Liang] of Han in his loyalty and [Horatio] Nelson of England in his righteous courage can be his peers. Alas! For 11 years, the Master held great military power in his hands, solely for the revival of his family and country, he troubled his mind, exhausted his body, and swallowed his tears, until, struck by stray bullets three times in total, he spattered his blood on the Noryang sea and finally ceased. Even I, a dullard (木頑) 300 years later, exploring his biography and tracing his deeds, find hot tears flowing uncontrollably. If the Master were to reappear in our Eastern land today, what regret would we have if we could all hold the whip following behind him? Only the waves of Noryang remain, striking the empty shore alone; only short fragments on bamboo and silk remain, meaninglessly carrying the tales of his battle merits. <61>

**Summary**

This 1922 article from the Korean magazine *Kaebyŏk* presents Yi Sun-sin as the ninth of "Ten Great Men," emphasizing his unwavering loyalty (精忠), strategic brilliance, personal integrity, and ultimate sacrifice during the Imjin War (1592-1598). It details his early career, his preparations for war, key naval victories like Hansan Island, his unjust dismissal due to court politics fueled by rival Wŏn Kyun, his reinstatement, and his heroic death at the Battle of Noryang. The author portrays Yi as a paragon of virtue – incorruptible, dedicated, compassionate towards his soldiers, yet stern in discipline – contrasting him with the factionalism and unpreparedness of the Chosŏn court.

From a colonial history perspective, this article is significant. Published during Japanese rule, the fervent praise of a Korean national hero famous for defeating Japanese invasions serves as a powerful, albeit potentially veiled, expression of Korean nationalism and resistance. Highlighting Yi's loyalty to *Chosŏn*, his strategic genius against a formidable foreign enemy (Japan), and his tragic end due to internal division could implicitly critique the contemporary situation and call for Korean unity and resilience. Historians might find the specific framing of Yi's virtues (loyalty, incorruptibility, strategic mind, sacrifice) and the emphasis on internal court failings valuable for understanding how nationalist narratives were constructed and disseminated under colonial constraints. The comparison to Zhuge Liang and Nelson positions Yi within a global context of great heroes.

萬古의 精忠=李舜臣先生, 十大 偉人 紹介의 其九
						一記者
緖言

李朝 500年의 間에는 勿論 幾多의 外患이 有하엿슬지나 壬辰(距今 332年 前)의 倭亂과 丙子 (距今 288年 前)의 胡亂으로써 그 最著한 者라 할지며 中에도 壬辰의 亂과 如함은 그 蒙患區域이 거의 朝鮮全土에 及함과 그 時日이 7年의 長에 及함과 22萬의 外國軍 (明軍)을 請來한 點의 等에서 實로 上下 4,000年을 通하야 그 類例를 見키 難한 巨變이엇다.
그러나 如許한 巨變을 目前에 控한 當時의 朝鮮形便을 如何하엿는가. 李太祖 登極 以後 昇平 200에 民은 兵을 不識하고 官은 權을 是尙하야 上下가 懈惰하엿스며 宣祖 8年 乙亥 至하야는 外戚 沈義謙(西)과 儒臣 金孝元(東) 兩人이 些事로써 隙을 作하야 東西의 分黨을 始하매 滿朝의 士- 문득 東西의 指目 中에 入하야 비록 毫末만큼한 일일지라도 孝元의 輩와 關係를 有한 者는 곳 東이라 指하며 義謙의 輩와 關係를 有한 者는 곳 西이라 目하야 朝廷에 全人이 無하엿스며
그 結果는 서로 排擠하고 서로 疑懼하야 黨爭이 有함과 知하는 外에 國事가 有함을 不知하며 或 有志의 國士- 是에 超越하야 經綸을 論議하면 滿朝가 驅迫하야 그 投足을 不得케 하는 바 비록 李珥, 李恒福, 李德馨, 柳成龍,＜49＞白仁傑 等과 如한 良相名臣이 不無하엿스나 其志를 不宣하엿스며 拮据無爲의 中에 曠古의 巨變은 來하엿다.
宣祖 25年 壬辰 夏 4月이라 日本의 豐臣秀吉이 約 15萬의 大軍으로써 侵入하매 平素의 對備가 無하야 三京이 失守하고 列郡이 土崩하며 大駕-西幸하야 宗社의 危難이 實로 累卵과 如하얏다. 其後 義兵이 大起하고 明兵이 來援하야 鄕國을 荒蕪에 復하고 大厦를 旣倒에 扶하엿다.
그런데 情勢-이러탓 蒼黃한 間에 在하야 能히 大亂의 將期를 豫見하고 從容히 準備를 是務하다가 局面이 一展함에 及하야는 少毫의 狼狽가 無하고 百戰에 百勝을 占하야 敵의 主力을 南海의 中에 滅盡하고 王國의 權威를 九鼎의 右에 重케한 忠義熱烈, 名聲嶙峋의 偉人이 有하니 世人의 公論에 依하면 忠武公 李舜臣 先生이 即 其人이라.

壬辰以前의 先生

先生의 字는 汝諧요 貫은 德水며 舜臣은 其名이오 忠武는 其謚이니 距今 377年 前 明宗 元年 乙未 3月 8日 漢城의 乾川洞에 生하다. 그 曾祖父 「琚」는 成宗, 燕山의 兩朝에 仕하야 臺官으로써 彈劾이 嚴正하매 虎掌令의 稱을 得하얏스며 그 祖父 「百祿」과 父 「貞」도 當時의 儒臣으로써 其名이 額著하야 家系가 甚히 頗正하엿다.
先生은 兒時로부터 英爽不羈하야 羣兒와 더부러 遊戱할 時에는 每樣 戰陣의 狀을 作하야 스스로 元帥가 되엿스며 閭里에서 或 不快한 事를 發見하면 문득 陵挫하야 里人이 憚畏하엿스며 漸次로 成長함에 及하야는 折節恭謹하며 書를 讀하얀 일즉이 大義를 通하얏스나 此로써 足爲할 것이 無하다 하야 武事를 轉習하얏는데 騎射-絶倫하야 同類를 呆然케 하엿스며 비록 武人과 同遊하나 高簡靜黙하야 一語의  言을 不發하는 바 儕流-敬畏하엿스며 丙子春(33)에 登第(武科)하고 是年冬에 咸鏡道의 童仇非權管이 되엇다가 後 4年 己卯에 訓鍊院에 歸仕하엿스며 後 庚辰에 鉢浦萬戶가 되엇스나 常侃侃不屈하야 不久에 罷免되고 癸未 秋에 南兵使李戭의 軍官이 되고 是冬에 更히 乾原權管으로 轉命되어 胡賊鬱只乃를 生擒하야 藩胡를 討平한 功이 有함에 不拘하고＜50＞ 兵使金禹瑞가 先生의 獨力成功을 忌하야 反히 擅兵을 理由로 하야 其罪를 請하얏스나 不果하엿스며 是冬에 父喪을 丁하고 丙戍 春에 司僕射主簿로 다시 造山萬戶에 榮轉되고 丁亥 秋에는 鹿屯島의 屯田官을 兼하얏는데 先生은 本島의 孤遠且軍少를 慮하야 兵使 李鎰에게 添病을 屢請하엿스나 不從하던 바 是歲 8月에 賊이 果然 大擧 來侵함으로 先生은 此를 艱倖히 擊退하며 流失에 中하야 左肱을 傷하얏는데 兵使 李鎰은 先生을 殺하야 口를 滅하야써 己罪를 免하고저 先生을 引致하야 極刑에 處하려할 새 先生이 事實을 正論하고 聲色을 不動하매 鎰이 또한 如何키 不能하야 朝廷에 啓聞하야 白衣從軍의 罰에 處하고 乃已하엿스며 其後에 全羅軍官으로 更히 井邑縣監, 滿浦僉使, 珍島郡守, 加里浦僉使 等을 歷任하고 辛卯 2月에 全羅左道 水軍節度使를 拜하니 家國을 爲하야 先生의 心身을 盡瘁할 機는 是로써 來하얏다.

壬辰의 亂과 先生

先生은 赴任 翌日로부터 外患의 在迫을 是慮하야 날로 備禦를 修할 새 干戈를 鍜하며 鐵鎖를 鑄하야 먼저 鎭口와 海港을 斷絶하고 有名한 龜船을 創作하야 突擊의 用에 備하다.
壬辰 4月에 日兵이 大至하야 먼저 釜山과 東萊를 陷하고 嶺南을 由하야 京師를 向할 새 先生이 兵을 移하야 擊코저 하니 麾下諸將이 다 鎭을 移하야 他道에 赴함을 不肯하거늘 先生이 문득 軍律로써 諸將을 督勵하야 5月 初에 唐浦에 至하야 慶尙右水使 元均을 訪하니 是時에 均이 日兵에게 大敗하야 戰船 70餘隻을 失하고 先生의 來援을 請한 中이엿슴으로 곳 元均의 殘兵과 合勢하야 第一合으로 王浦에서 敵船 30餘隻을 破하고 同月 末에는 更히 敵을 泗川에 追하야 13隻을 燒破하얏는데 是日에는 先生이 또한 丸을 受하야 左肩을 傷하얏스나 終日토록 督戰하고 戰을 罷함에 及하야 軍中이 始知하엿스며 6月 初에는 敵을 唐浦에 遇하야 그 酋將을 射殺하고 後 5日에는 全羅右水使 李億祺와 合兵하야 32船을 撞破하고 그 將을 射殺하야 軍勢가 大振한 바 是功으로 資憲에 陞하엿스며 7月 初에 敵이 다시 梁山으로부터 湖南에 向한다는 所聞을 接하고 兵을 固城 見乃梁에 進하니 敵이 과연 30餘船을 先鋒으로하야 無數兵船이 海를 蔽하야 來하거늘 先生이 이에 佯退하야 敵을 閑山島의＜51＞ 前洋에 誘至하야 反擊 大波할 새 賊船 73隻을 盡破하고 將卒 近 萬人을 鏖戮하야 海水-盡赤하니 世人의 所謂 閑山大捷이라 함이 即 是이라. 是功으로써 正憲에 陞하다.
閑山戰의 直後에 다시 敵을 安骨浦에 迎戰하야 42船을 燒破하고 仝 9月에는 先生이 元均, 李億祺 等과 共히 釜山의 敵을 進擊하야 그 巢穴을 蕩覆하기로 하고 釜山에 出兵하엿스나 日兵이 其威를 畏하야 敢出치 못하고 오즉 登高放丸할뿐인 故로 空船 百餘隻을 燒盡하고 歸하다.
後 癸巳 7月에 本營을 閑山에 移하야 戰備를 益修하엿스며 同 8月에 朝廷이 先生으로써 特히 三道 (慶尙, 忠靑, 全羅) 水軍統制使를 拜하야 三道의 水軍을 統攝케 하니 盖先主의 偉名이 廟堂에 高한 故이라.

「欲忠於國而罪已至 欲報於親而親亦亡」

高木이 風을 受함은 是-理의 不免이라 할가. 先生이 또한 그 例에 脫出하지 못하엿다. 卽 慶尙水使 元均이 自己의 功不及을 不思하고 徒히 先生의 下에 立하게 된 것을 是忌하야 百方으로 先生을 猜疑하얏다. 先生이 그 情을 思하야 每日 優容하되 均의 性됨이 組暴無節하야 節制를 不遵하매 先生은 大事를 是할가 恐하야 事實로써 朝廷에 報한 즉 朝廷이 均을 忠情兵使로 遷한지라. 均이 이로부터 더욱 先生을 怨恨하야 朝貴와 締結하야 先生을 搆誣코저할 새 마츰 이때에 日將行長.淸正 等이 先生의 偉名을 忌하야 反問을 行하야써 그를 除하기로 하고 먼저 行長의 麾下 要時羅로 하여금 慶尙兵使 金應瑞의 陳에 來케 하야 거즛 和를 請한 즉 朝廷에서는 일즉이 俘虜가 된 王子를 脫還케 하기 爲하야 其事를 相議케 하얏는데 1日은 要時羅가 그윽히 金에게 告하되 今에 和親이 成치 못함은 專혀 淸正에게 由함인 바 余-甚히 그를 憎惡하는지라 그가 某日에 某海를 渡할지니 그 機를 乘하야 그를 除함이 如何오 하매 應瑞-此를 朝廷에 告한 즉 朝廷은 先生을 命하야 此에 當케하얏스나 先生은 敵의 巧言을 可信치 못할 것이라하고 드대여 不行한 바 元均의 意를 受한 政府의 臺諫들은 此機可乘이라 하야 書를 上하야 先生의＜52＞ 逗遛한 罪를 彈劾하엿스나 李元翼, 柳成龍이 그 不然을 力說함으로 王이 다시 侍臣을 遣하야 그 事實을 廉問한 즉 侍臣이 亦 均에게 黨與하야 事實을 誣告한 바 丁酉 2月에 드대여 先生을 京城에 拿鞠하야 其職을 遞하고 特히 容宥하야 白衣로 從軍케하다.
是에 先하야 先生이 令狀을 受하야 漢城을 向하는 途에 就할 時에는 一路의 軍民이 簇擁號泣하야 그 如何할 바를 不知하엿스며 同 4月에 白衣從軍의 處分을 受하고 仍히 母喪을 丁함에 及하야는 先生이 伏地慟哭하되 「竭忠於國而罪已至, 欲報於親而親亦亡」이라 하야 遠近이 嗟惜하엿스며 其後 元均이 先生을 對하야 未幾에 敗死하고 朝廷으로부터 更히 先生을 起用함에 及하야는 避亂士民이 各히 先生을 望見하고 皆曰而今後, 吾儕當不死라 하야 一境이 遂復하엿다.

將星晨落海雲中

丁酉 8月에 先生이 다시 統制가 되며 곳 順天府境에 馳入하야 兵船 10餘隻과 亡卒 數百을 收得하야 敵을 蘭島에 破하다. 이때에 朝廷으로부터 先生의 兵少勢弱을 慮하야 海를 捨하고 陸에 登하기를 權하엿스나 先生이 써하되 壬辰의 後로 敵이 敢히 南을 犯치 못함은 舟師가 其勢를 沮함에 因함인 바 이제 만일 舟師를 撤하면 敵이 반즛이 湖南을 由하야 漢城에 達할 것이라 하야 不從하고 同 9月에 겨우 10餘隻의 戰船으로써 330餘隻의 敵船을 珍島의 碧波亭下에 迎擊하야 其將을 斬하고 其船 30餘隻을 撞破하야 軍聲이 復進한 바 朝廷이 是功으로써 賞을 論코저 하엿스나 言者의 沮止로 不果하엿스며 戊戌 春에 本鎭을 康津古今島에 移하고 屯耕을 行하야 持久의 備를 行하엿스며 是年秋에 明將陳璘이 水兵 5,000을 領하고 先生과 來會하얏는데 陳의 性이 悍驁하며 또 天兵의 大將임을 自恃하야 驕傲-無比하엿스나 先生이 優遇로써 接하고 正言으로써 對하야 陳將軍은 勿論이오 그 部下의 將卒까지 小毫의 非行을 不敢하엿스며 陳은 特히 先生이 治軍制敵에 感한 바 有하야 陳에 臥할 時에는 一切의 君號指揮를 先生에게 讓하고 進하야 그 節制를 受하엿스며 先生을 稱할 時에는 必히 李爺라 하야 其名을 不呼하얏고 宣祖大王에게 上書할 時에는 先生을 讚하야 經天緯地의 才와 補天浴日의 功이 有하다 하얏스며 다시＜53＞ 明帝에게 奏聞하야 先生에게 都督印을 特賜케 하얏나니 盖先生의 器와 德에 心服한 故이라.

却說 壬辰의 年으로부터 戊戌의 歲에 至하기까지 凡 7年의 間이라 日兵이 그 始에는 到處에 勝利를 博하엿스나 그 後 義兵의 奮起와 明兵의 來援으로 因하야 10常 8,9의 慘敗를 當하야 其軍이 半滅하얏고 且 戊戌秋에 至하야는 關白 豐臣秀吉이 死하고 諸將이 爭立하매 是를 聞한 行長.義弘等의 諸將은 別로 歸心이 如矢하야 每樣 脫身入國을 企하엿스나 陸에 明將 劉綎의 大軍이 有하며 海에 李舜臣. 陳璘의 强兵이 有하야 其途를 不得하고 晝夜로 苦悶하던 中 畢竟 陸의 劉綎을 厚待하야 和를 乞하고 更히 海의 陳璘에게 刀貨와 猪酒를 厚送하야 歸途를 乞한 바 陳이 亦其賄에 中하야 和를 許코저 하거늘 先生이 其非를 力說하야 事-不果하엿는데 此를 知한 行長은 更히 先生에게 銃劍을 遣하야 和를 乞하얏스나 先生이 峻拒한바 到處에 峻絶을 當한 行長은 忿氣-撑中하야 泗川의 軍을 請來하야 最後의 勇을 鼓奮하기로 하니 泗川의 軍은 是薩州의 兵으로서 强勇無敵한 者이라. 戊戌 11月 18日 黃昏이라 行長.義弘의 兵이 南海로부터 嚴木浦와 驚梁에 來泊한 者-其數-甚多하며 戰船만으로 거의 五百을 算하얏다. 是夜 先生이 陳璘과 共히 兵을 出하야 鷺梁에서 賊을 遇하야 且戰且休할 새 敵勢-頗强하야 容易히 勝負를 決치 못하던 中 19日 拂曉에 入하며 明軍과 共히 火戰을 大行하야 軍聲이 大振하는 瞬間에 先生이 流丸을 中하야 船中에 倒하며 다 못『戰이 方急하엿스니 삼가 余의 死를 洩言치 말라』하는 一言을 遺하고 逝하니 (時年이 54) 長子 薈 兄子 莞이 遺意를 受하야 先生의 尸軆를 房中에 掩慝하고 令旗를 揮하기 前과 如히 하야 周圍의 敵을 大破하고 進하야 陳璘의 船을 求하야 其圍를 解하고 行長과 義弘이 脫身逃走하야 此役을 終하얏는데 戰이 破함에 及하야 陳璘이 船을 驅하야 先生의 船에 近하야 先生의 功을 謝하고저 한 即 先生의 命이 已休한지라 陳都督이 船上에 仆倒하기 3次에 及하며 大聲으로 呼哭하되 「이제로부터 다시 누구와 더부로 大事를 論議하리요」하야 軍中이 齊哭하고 明軍까지 一齊히 肉을 投하엿스며 靈柩가 古今島를 發하야 牙山으로 返할 새 一路의 老幼男女가 號哭하야 隨之하엿스며 朝廷으로서는 禮官을 遣하야 祭를 賜하고 右議政을 追贈하엿스며 當時의 諸大官은 輓歌와 祭文을 送하야 先生의 最後를 送하니 是日은 越明年 己亥 2月 11日이엿스며 牙山의 羅當山下北原에＜54＞  葬하다.
當時 又는 後世에 在하야 先生의 偉勳과 英風을 慕하야 祠를 建하고 碣을 立한 것이 其數-實多하니 曰忠烈祠 (一在南海縣露梁, 一在統制營洗兵舘之西), 曰顯忠祠 (在牙山郡東20里), 曰遺祠 (在康津古今島), 曰遺廟 (在巨濟城內), 曰忠愍祠 (在順天), 曰忠武祠 (在海南), 曰月山祠 (在咸平) 曰遺愛祠 (在井邑), 曰忠孝堂 (在溫陽), 曰草廟 (在巨濟之鑿梁)等은 그 大槪이며 後 甲辰에 朝廷에서 壬辰의 戰功을 論議할 새 先生으로써 第1을 삼고 効忠仗義, 迪毅協力, 宣武功臣의 號를 賜하엿다. 判書 李睟光과 領議政 柳成龍의 先生을 追慕한 挽詩數節을 示하야 이 項을 終決하리라.

輓李統制

李睟光

威名久懾犬羊羣, 蓋世奇功天下聞. 蠻祲夜收湖外月, 將星晨落海中雲. 波濤未洩英雄恨, 竹帛空垂戰伐勳. 今日男兒知幾個, 可憐忠義李將軍.

哀李統制

柳成

閒山島古今島, 大海之中數點碧. 當時百戰李將軍, 隻手親扶天半壁. 鯨兒戮盡血殷波, 烈火燒竭溤夷窟. 功高不免讒妬摳構, 性命鴻毛安足惜. 君不見峴山東頭一片石, 羊公去後人垂泣. 凄凉數間愍忠祠, 風雨年年(八字缺-원문)不修, 時有蜓戶呑聲哭.

半世落拓世莫能知

先生의 性됨이 剛直不屈하야 오즉 一定한 目的을 爲하야 忠誠을 盡함만 知하고 頭를 低하며 膝을 屈하야 不當의＜55＞ 譽를 干하거나 又는 計를 行하야 當來의 患을 免코저 함과 如한 苟且가 少無하얏스니 左에 示하는 바는 其例의 一이라.
柳西厓와 先生은 幼時로부터 相善한지라 兵判 李栗谷이 일즉 先生의 爲人을 聞하고 西厓를 通하야 一見코저 한즉 先生이 써하되 余는 栗谷과 同族이라. 義로는 맛당히 相厚할지나 全相의 時에는 往見할 수 업다 하야 마츰내 不往하얏스며 先生이 訓練院 末職에 잇슬 때에 兵判 金貴榮이 庶産女로써 先生의 妾을 作코저 하얏스나 先生이 써하되 仕路에 初出하면서 權門에 跡을 托함은 余의 志가 아니라 하야 媒人을 峻絶하얏스며 庚辰年間에 鉢鋪 萬戶되엇슬 時에는 先生의 上官되는 左水使 成鎛이 사람을 本浦에 派하야 客舍의 庭中에 在한 桐木을 斫하야 琴을 作코저 하거늘 公이 拒하야 曰「이는 官家의 公物이라. 栽할 時에 其意가 有하엿슬지니 伐할 時에 엇지 其意가 無하리요」하야 水使-大怒하엿스나 結局 取去치 못하엿스며 己丑年間에 曹大中이 逆事로 逮獄되엇는데 曹의 家物을 押收하는 中에 先生의 書簡이 亦此에 入한지라 知友-先生을 爲하야 그윽히 此를 拔取코저한대 先生이 止하야 曰 余야-다못 問安의 書를 交換하엿슬 뿐이라. 엇지 此를 拔取하야 私事를 行하리요 하매 知友-先生의 大凡을 嘆服하엿스며 當日 大丈夫-世에 生하야 用하면 死를 効하고 不用하면 野에 耕하면 足할지라 媚를 世間에 呈하야 一時의 榮을 窃함과 如함은 余의 恥하는 바라 하며 又 曰 亂世의 將臣이 되어 少毫이나마 激功의 心을 有한다 하면 是는 眞正한 忠誠이 아니라 敵이 退하는 日에 余가 死하엿스면 遺憾이 無하겟다 하더니 果然 其言을 如히 敵이 退하는 當日에 鷺梁에서 殉死하얏다. 그 心事의 熱烈함이 果如何한가.

鴻毛輕處死常榮

鴻毛輕處死常榮이라함은 李塏의 訣詩中 一句이어니와 先生의 難局에 處하는 道-恒常 如許하엿다.
鹿島의 役에 兵使 李鎰이 先生을 誣殺하려할 새 同類宣居怡-울며 公에게 勸하야 曰 酒를 飮하야 心을 鎭하라. 先生이 答 曰 死生이 有命하니 飮酒何爲오. 居怡 曰 酒雖不飮이나 水則可飮가 先生이 曰 余 今不渴이어니 何必飮水리요 하야 그대로 李鎰의 取拷에 應하엿스며 丁酉年中에 元均의 搆誣로써 京師에 拿引될 새 知友-從容히＜56＞ 告하여 曰 王怒-方極하며 朝論이 且重하야 大勢를 難測할지라 君의 意-如何오 先生이 但 曰「죽이면 죽을 것이라 하고 其罪를 鞠聞함에 及하야는 事의 首末을 整陳할 뿐이오. 다시 他를 傍引치 아니한 바 滿朝-嘆服하엿스며 鷺梁의 役을 起하기 直前에 明의 都督 陳璘이 敵의 賂賄를 受하고 行長의 歸路를 開與할 意로 强히 行長을 舍하고 南海의 敵을 功코저 하거늘 先生이 此를 否拒한 즉 陳璘이 亦不下하다가 드대여 劒을 按하며 曰 「皇上이 我에게 長劒을 與하얏다」한 즉 先生이  晏然하야 曰 一死는 足히 惜할 것이 업거니와 余가 大將이 되어는 決코 歸敵을 放還할 수 업다 하야 陳의 意를 挽回하얏나니 先生의 剛氣-盖如許하엿다.

持法秉正, 毫無假借

先生이 官에 居할 時에는 恒常 法을 持하고 正을 秉하야 號令嚴明, 秋毫도 假借한 바 無하얏다. 閒山의 陳에 잇서 明將 陣璘의 兵이 자못 掠奪을 恣行하야 良民을 困케 하는 지라 先生이 1日은 軍中에 令하야 大小의 幕舍를 撤毁케 하며 스스로 衣衾을 船中에 移送하얏다. 陳璘이 此를 見하고 怪疑하야 部下를 遣하야 探問한 즉 先生이 答하되 朝鮮의 軍民이 天軍을 仰하기 父母와 如하거늘 天兵이 此를 不諒하고 掠奪을 恣行하야 良民이 逃遁하니 余-朝鮮의 大將이 되어 호올로 留할 수 無한지라 이에 海에 浮하야 他에 移코저 함이라 한대 陳璘이 大驚馳來하야 先生의 手를 執하야써 止하고 自後로 明兵에 關한 監督을 先生에게 一任하야 秋毫의 非行을 不敢하엿스며 또 일즉 訓鍊院에 仕할 時에는 그 上官되는 兵部郎某가 有하야 某昵親人 某를 參軍에 越轉케 하려 하는지라 先生이 正言으로 制하되 卑者-越遷하면 高者-滯할지라 公事에 如許한 理法이 無하다 하야 兵部郎이 威로써 壓하얏스나 不屈하얏나니 그 威重이 槪如許하얏다.

非能用武, 亦長經理

先生은 用武에 能하엿슬뿐 아니라 또 事務의 處理와 事業의 經理에 長하얏다. 일즉 兼官으로 泰仁縣에 至하얏는데＜57＞ 그때의 泰仁은 오래동안 主宰를 缺하야 簿書-堆積하얏다. 先生이 그를 剖決하되 流함과 如하야 頃刻에 畢盡한 바 傍人이 驚服하엿스며 또 일즉 李元翼이 朝論을 受하야 都軆察로써 南下하엿슬 時에 水軍으로부터 呈狀한 것이 無數하되 진즉 此를 不決하고 軸을 作하야 晉州의 先生을 訪하야 此를 決케 하얏는데 先生이 卽席에서 此를 決盡하는지라 李公이 疑하야 此를 試閱한 即 다-其理에 當하얏는지라 다시금 驚嘆하되 「吾輩의 未能을 君이 어찌 獨能하는가」한 即 先生이 但云 「그것이 모다 舟師에 關한 것인 故로 耳目에 習하야 然함이라」하얏다. 그 事에 敏하고 人에 兼함이 盖如許하엿다.
그리고 每樣 事의 經理를 不忘하야 亂의 未起에 先하야는 龜船을 備하야 聯捷의 用을 得하얏스며 行軍 6年에 軍糧의 未給을 慮하야 遂-魚鹽을 大開하고 屯田을 廣設하야 利國補軍에 少毫의 遺漏가 無하얏스며 또 鍮를 民間에 募하야 火器를 鑄한 等 一策一事에 모다 凱切을 極하얏다.

鞠躬盡瘁, 死而後已

先生이 陣中에 在하기 凡 6年에 全혀 女色을 屛하고 夜에 衣帶를 不解하엿스며 每樣自奉이 薄하야 日數合米의 素食을 行하는 外에 他食이 無하고 必, 夜寐夙興하되 鷄가 嗚하면 곳 明燭起坐하야 或 文書를 閱하며 籌策을 講하야 形容이 常瘁한 바 宣祖大王으로부터 先生의 健康을 慮하야 時로 滋味를 下賜한 即 涕泣勉受하엿스며 甲午年 中에는 先生이 染病을 得하야 病勢-頗重하되 一日을 不臥하고 事를 視하기 如前하는 바 部下-或 先生의 萬一을 慮하야 休攝을 請한 即 先生이 써하되 「이제 敵으로 더부러 相對하야 勝敗가 呼吸에 決한지라 내가 死치 아니 하엿거니 어찌 安臥할 수가 有하리요」하야 12日間을 强病하엿스며 戊戌의 11月 18日 夜, 先生이 最後의 運命으로써 最後의 決戰을 行할 時에 當夜 3更에 先生이 船上에 登하야 天을 仰하고 盥手暗祝하되 「此 讎를 苦除하면 死卽無憾」이라 하야 一段의 心血을 盡注하엿스며 亂中에 在할 時에는 每日의 日記를 繼續하엿스며 「明燭獨坐, 念到國事, 不覺淚下」 「獨坐船上, 流淚雨下」等의 文字가 處處에 現하야 千秋의 後人으로도＜58＞ 스스로 卷을 掩하고 淚를 飮케 하며 先生의 筆에 成한 「讀宋史」 「閑山島吟」等의 文을 閱하면 憂國憂民의 情衷이 그대로 紙面에 躍動함을 見할지라 이제 그 文의 2,3을 示하면 如左

無題六韻

蕭蕭風雨夜 耿耿不寐時 懷痛如摧膽 傷心似割肌 山河猶帶慘 魚鳥亦吟悲 國有蒼黃勢 人無任轉危 恢復思諸葛 長驅慕子儀 經年防備策 今作聖君斯
閑山島夜吟
水國秋光暮 驚寒雁陣高 憂心輾轉夜 殘月照弓刀

閑山島歌

閑山島明月夜 上戌樓 撫大刀深愁時 何處一聲羌笛更添愁
按趙慶男亂中雜錄 有閑山吟咏二十韻云 而屢經兵燹 散佚不傳
劒銘
三尺誓天 山河動色
其二
手剸鯨鯢 氣帶山河
無題一聯
誓海漁龍動 盟山草木知＜59＞

讀宋史

嗚呼. 玆何等時. 而綱欲去耶. 去又何之耶. 夫人臣事君. 有死無貳. 當此時也. 宗社之危. 僅如一髮之引千鈞.玆正人臣損軀報國秋. 去之之言固不可萌諸心. 況取出諸口耶. 然則爲綱計奈何. 毁形泣血披肝瀝膽. 明言事勢. 至此無可和之理. 言旣不從. 繼之以死. 又不然姑從其計. 身豫其間. 爲之委曲彌縫. 死中求生. 萬一或有可濟之理. 綱計不出此. 而欲求去. 玆豈人臣委身事君義哉.

端嚴雅飭을 極한 先生은 他面으로 人을 仁愛함이 甚하야 恒常 己에 薄하고 人에 厚하고저 하얏다. 戰陣에 在할 時에는 每夜에 士를 休하고 반듯이 스스로 箭羽을 理하엿스며 船頭에 立하야는 스스로 弓矢를 持하고 或은 鼓를 打하야 親히 矢石의 前에 當하얏다. 部下-或 先生의 自重을 勸하면 但 曰 諸君이 矢石을 甘受하거니 내홀로 帷幄의 運籌로 自安할 수 有하리요 하야 聞者-戚然하엿스며 일즉 元均과 隙을 生하야 流言이 紛紛할 時에 先生이 그 子弟를 警戒하되 人이 或, 問하는 者-有하면 彼의 功이 有함을 言하고 삼가 其非를 勿言하라 하엿스며 戊戌의 7月에 陳璘의 兵과 先生의 兵이 力을 幷하야 出戰하다가 先生의 兵이 船 6隻과 首 69級을 獲함에 反하야 明兵은 何等의 所得이 無한지라 陳璘이 此를 忿하야 그 責任者를 强詰하려 하거늘 先生이 其意를 解하고 陳을 慰하되 老爺-明朝의 大將이 되어 我軍과 共히 海寇를 來討하매 我軍의 捷이 即 老爺의 捷이라 하고 이에 그 捕獲을 全혀 陳에게 歸하니 陳이 先生의 好誼에 感하야 從後로 더욱 先生을 敬愛하엿다하며 先生의 統制時에 部下의 或 人이 形을 當하게 되엇는데 子弟 中 1人이 先生에게 告하되 此 人을 罪가 重한 바 輕에 處할 수 업다 한 즉 先生이 가로되 刑은 그 律이 自存한 즉 人의 言으로 輕重을 變通할 수 업는 것이며 또 子弟된 道가 맛당히 生道로써 人을 救함은 可커니와 重刑으로써 請함은 不可하다 하야 子弟-赧然하엿스며 先生의 2兄이 先亡하고 그 遺孤-在側한 바 先生은 特히 此를 愛撫하야 手握重兵11年에 子女의 婚嫁를 一問한 事-無하되 그들에 對하야는 爲할 바를 皆爲하엿스며 尙又 그 士卒을 撫愛하되 己出과 如히 하야 上으로부터 或 下賜함이 有하면 반듯이 此를 軍中에 分하얏스며＜60＞ 都體察使 李元翼이 南下함에 及하야는 李公의 名으로써 스스로 軍을 餉하야 將卒을 激勵하엿으며 機會만 有하면 戰亡將卒을 祭하되 그 文을 自制하야 辭意-惻恒을 極하얏나니 副將 鄭運을 祭한 文은 그 中의 一이라 試하야 此를 示하면
嗚呼 人生必有死, 死生必有命, 爲人一死 固不足惜 君獨可傷者 國連不幸 島夷作孼 嶺南諸城 望風奔潰귀長驅卷席 所向無敵 都城一夕 兇醜成巢 千里關西 鑾輿播越 北望長痛 怒膽如裂 嗟我短拙 討殲無策 與軍論難 披雲見曜 計定揮劒 戰艘相連 決死掛席 冒刀先登 倭奴數百 一時流血 黑烟漲天 日東愁雲 四度報捷 是誰之功 恢復宗社 指日可期 豈意神天不佑 毒丸遽及 彼蒼者天 理宜難究 回船更突 誓欲報怨 日宜奄暮 風亦不順 未遂所願 平生之痛 豈過於此也 言念及此 痛若割肌 所恃者君 更將何爲 一陣諸將 痛惜無已 鶴髮在堂 己矣誰將 抱恨窮泉 曷時瞑目 嗚呼痛哉 嗚呼痛哉 才不展時 位不滿德 邦家不幸 軍民無福 如君忠義 古今罕聞 爲國忘身 有事猶生 長恨世間 誰識我心 含哀致誠 遙奠一酌 嗚呼痛哉

結言

先生은 李朝 200年 泰平의 餘에 出現하야 軒仰한 意氣와 熱烈한 忠義로써 其生을 終始하되 一毫이 苟且가 無하엿스며 特히 壬辰의 亂에 잇서 그 發揮한 誠과 勇과 또 智와 功은 그 量에서나 또는 質에서나 上下 4千年間의 歷史에 表現된 偉人 全部를 通見할지라도 先生의 우에 出할 者-無하며 오즉 漢의 諸葛이 그 忠誠에서 英의 「넬손」이 그 義勇에서 能히 先生의 儔가 될 것뿐이라. 오호라 先生은 手에 重兵을 執하기 11년에 오즉 家國의 부식을 위하야 그 心을 勞하고 그 形을 瘁하며 그 淚를 飮하다가 流丸을 中하기 凡三度에 그 血을 鷺梁의 海에 濺하고 乃已하얏도다. 300年 後의 木頑인 필자로도 그 傳을 考하며 그 跡을 探함에 熱淚-스스로 滂沱하도다. 이제 先生으로 하야금 우리의 東土에 復作한다하면 우리가 다-가티 先生을 爲하야 後鞭을 執한 덜 何恨이 有하리요.다 못 露梁의 파도가 잇서 호올노 空城을 打할뿐이며 竹帛의 短篇이 잇서 속절업시 戰勳을 乘할 뿐이로다.＜61＞
