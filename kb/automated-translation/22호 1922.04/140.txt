**Summary**

This article compiles news briefs from March 1922 in colonial Korea. It covers social initiatives like the Tong-A Ilbo's efforts to connect with overseas Koreans, educational changes including new exams and increased fees, infrastructural updates like the Seoul-Yongsan phone line unification, the founding of a "World Association," labor unrest with a strike at a Pusan spinning mill, establishment of new schools, student activism at Posŏng College regarding day classes, international connections like Yi Chong-nin joining the World Press Congress and Dr. Mott's visit, a major snowstorm, numerous school graduations listing graduate numbers, the formation of a Korean student association in Germany, and a calligraphy exhibition. For historians, this piece offers a valuable snapshot of urban life, education policy impacts, early labor movements, nascent international engagement (both personal and organizational), and cultural activities under Japanese rule. The mention of omitting political news "due to circumstances" also hints at the restrictive environment of the time.
