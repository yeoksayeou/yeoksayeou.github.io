The Righteous Merchant of Pakch'ŏn, the Late Mr. Pyŏn Yonggak, Who Forgave Debts Amounting to 130,000 Won
						By One Reporter

In Ŭiju, North P'yŏngan Province, there was Im Kwaksan, known as the "Man of Broad Learning and Virtue" (博物君子), who early on engaged in commerce with China and achieved an indelible great name in the history of Korean trade, a fact acknowledged by many. However, possessing wisdom and skill comparable to this Mr. Im, residing in a pivotal region of Western Korea, skillfully trading and practicing benevolence, there was a great, righteous, and wealthy merchant whom we cannot ignore: the subject of this piece, the late Mr. Pyŏn Yonggak of Pakch'ŏn. Born in the Kapsul year (1874), fourth month, he studied Chinese classics from an early age, passed the preliminary civil service examination (進士) in the Kap'o year (1894), and from the Chŏngyu year (1897) at age 24, began business as a commodities broker (物産客主), amassing a fortune of tens of thousands. In the Pyŏngo year (1906), he became one of the founders of the private Pangmyŏng School (私立博明學校), contributing much effort and money. Around the Sinhae (1911) and Imja (1912) years, however, many affairs went against his wishes, especially the mining venture started around the Pyŏngo year (1906) which did not go according to plan, leading to a situation where the general state of his family assets became unfavorable. He then voluntarily undertook a decisive, righteous liquidation, throwing everything into one last gamble (乾坤一擲), and spent his remaining days in honest poverty before departing this world in the autumn of the Ŭlma year (乙卬 - likely a typo, see notes), having just completed his 54th year.

Never mind today's Korea where foreigners come and go and trains rattle along; even in the old Korea where this was not the case, where were the famous trading centers of our country? They were said to be (1) Kanggyŏng, (2) Wŏnsan, (3) Pakch'ŏn, these three locations being the most prominent. He conducted brokerage and trade businesses in Pakch'ŏn, one of these three locations, and generally dealt with the wealthiest individuals in Korea's key areas. It would not be an exaggeration to say that not only the fish, seaweed, and rice commonly handled by commodity brokers, but also copper from Kapsan and cotton from Hwanghae Province entirely passed through his hands for collection and distribution. Particularly, his judgment of goods and his trustworthiness with people set him apart from others; his word was his bond (lit. his word was money), his hand was the scale, and the price he named was the set price.

Pyŏn Yonggak

In the year he suffered an unexpected, disastrous failure due to unrecovered loans and the poor performance of his mining business, examining his account books reveals he had claims (credits) amounting to 131,541 Wŏn 69 chŏn, and debts (liabilities) of 36,730 Wŏn 94 chŏn. If he had taken measures to settle the debts with these claims, not only would he have avoided failure, but he would have retained a huge sum of over 94,000 Wŏn, enough to live out his remaining years quite comfortably by local standards. However, he did not do so. Instead, he sold off all his land and buildings to fully repay his debts and simply burned and abandoned the claims worth over 130,000 Wŏn. When some among his close friends, not understanding his intention, criticized his recklessness, he simply said, "Either way, I am a man facing failure. If I were now to try and collect all those debts, I could not do so without inflicting the same kind of disastrous failure I experienced upon many people (over 130 households). I cannot bear to do such a thing." Such was the integrity and flawlessness of his heart.

Having abandoned claims worth over 130,000 Wŏn, he had no house to live in and no daily necessities. It is heard that for about two years afterwards, he lived in considerable hardship before falling into his final sleep. Due to financial difficulties (though other reasons were not absent, the main cause is said to be financial hardship), another pitiful event was that his direct son, P'unghyŏn, recently took his own life in Sinanju. Alas! There should be rewards for those who give, and glory returning to the righteous, yet he alone received none. While praising Mr. Pyŏn's righteous deed, I earnestly request that those among the people of Pakch'ŏn who had direct or indirect connections with Mr. Pyŏn give this matter some thought. <102>

**Summary**

This article eulogizes Pyŏn Yonggak, a formerly wealthy merchant from Pakch'ŏn in North P'yŏngan Province, Korea. Born in 1874, he amassed a fortune through commodity brokerage but faced financial ruin due to bad loans and a failed mining venture around 1911-1912. Despite having enough credits (131,541 Won) to cover his debts (36,730 Won) and retain a substantial sum, Pyŏn chose to sell his assets to pay his creditors and forgave all debts owed to him (over 130,000 Won) to spare over 130 debtor families from ruin. He lived his last years in poverty and died sometime before the article's publication in 1922 (the text mentions age 54 and the year 'Ŭlma', creating a chronological inconsistency). The article laments his family's subsequent hardship, including his son's suicide due to poverty, and calls for recognition of Pyŏn's righteousness. For colonial history, the article provides insight into the Korean merchant class, regional trade hubs (Pakch'ŏn, Kanggyŏng, Wŏnsan), common commodities (copper, cotton, fish, rice), the risks of business ventures like mining, and the impact of economic shifts in early colonial Korea. It highlights traditional Confucian values like righteousness (義) influencing economic decisions, even amidst hardship, and implicitly critiques the lack of social support or recognition for such acts.

十三萬圓의 債權을 放棄한 博川의 義商 故 邊龍珏氏
						一記者
平北 義州에는 博物君子의 稱을 가진 林郭山이 잇서 일즉이 中國과 商을 通하야 朝鮮貿易史上에 썩지 못할 偉名을 일운 일은 만흔 사람이 共認하는 바이다. 그런데 이 林氏와 對할 만한 睿智와 手腕을 가지고 西鮮의 要樞인 어떠한 地域에 안저 能히 交易하고 能히 慈惠하야 우리가 不問에 付치 못할 한 큰 義로운 豪商이 잇셧스니 本題의 主人公인 博川의 故 邊龍珏氏가 卽 그이다. 그는 甲戌 四月에 生하야 일즉이 漢學을 修하고 그로써 甲午의 試에 應하야 進士가 되엿스며 24歲된 丁酉로부터 物産客主의 業을 始하야 累萬의 富를 致하얏스며 丙午年에 私立博明學校의 設立員의 一人이 되어 誠으로 金으로 만흔 周旋을 行하얏스며 辛亥壬子年頃에 至하야는 事-만히 志에 違하고 特히 丙午年頃부터 始한 鑛業이 其計에 不入하야 家産의 大勢-利물지 못하게 되매 그는 自進하야 乾坤一擲의 義르운 淸算을 斷行하고 淸貧의 裏에서 남이지 日月을 送하다가 乙卬의 秋에 겨우 54歲를 1期로 하야 世를 棄하엿다.
外人이 왓다갓다 하고 汽車-드르럭 드르럭하는 今日의 朝鮮은 말할 것이 업고 그러치 아니 하얏던 녯날 朝鮮에서는 우리 나라의 有名한 交易地가 어대이엿는가 하면 (1) 江景 (2) 元山 (3) 博川이라 하야 이 三地點으로써 最著하다 하엿다. 그런데 그는 이 三地點의 一인 博川에 中介, 貿易의 業을 行하야 鮮內樞要地의 巨富와는 大槪로 그 去來를 通하엿스며 物産客主業에 通有한 魚藿 米穀의 類는 勿論이오 甲山의 銅과 黃海의 棉은 全部가 그의 手를 經하야 集散되엇다 하여도 過言이 아니엇섯다. 特히 그의 物에 對한 觀察과 人에 對한 信用은 與他自別하야 그의 말이 곳 돈이엇고 그의 손이 곳 저울이엿스며 그의 부르는 갑이 곳 定價이엇섯다.
邊龍珏

貸金의 不回收와 鑛業의 不如意로 뜻아니한 慘敗를 當하던 그해의 그의 帳簿를 考하면 債權이 131,541圓69錢이엇스며 債務가 36,730圓94錢이엇는 바 그 債權으로써 그 債務를 淸帳할 策을 取한다 하면 失敗가 되지 아니 할 것은 勿論이오 9萬 4千餘圓의 巨額을 殘하야 地方의 生活로는 오히려 浩浩蕩蕩히 餘生을 보내 일 것이라. 그러나 그는 그를 不爲하고 自己의 土地와 建物의 全部를 放賣하야 債務를 畢償하고 13萬餘圓의 債權을 그대로 燒却放棄하엿다. 그의 親友 中 或 그의 意를 不解하는 者- 그의 無謀를 責하면 旦 曰 「나는 左右間 失敗하는 사람이라. 내가 이제 그 債權의 全部를 請取코져하면 여러 사람에게 내가 當한 그것과 가튼 慘敗를 여러 사람 (130餘戶)에게 주지 아니하고는 不能할지니 나는 그와가튼 일을 참아 못한다」하엿슬뿐이다. 그 心地의 公廉無瑕함이 大槪 그러하엿다.
13萬餘圓의 金權을 放棄한 그는 自己의 居住할 집이 업섯스며 日用할 物資가 업섯다. 듯견대 그 後의 約 2年間은 퍽 困苦히 지내다가 긴 잠을 들엇다 한다. 生活難으로써 (다른 原因도 不無하엿스나 그 大部는 生活難이라 함) 또 한가지 可憐한 일은 그의 直子되는 風現君이 日前 新安州州에서 其生을 自斷한 그것이다. 嗚呼라. 주는 者에게 그 갑흠이 잇스며 義로운 者에게 그 돌아가는 榮光이 잇거늘 호을로 그에게 업섯도다. 내-邊氏의 義擧를 贊하는 同時에 그윽히 博川人士 中에도 直接間接으로 邊氏와 關係를 가젓든 사람의 一考가 잇기를 乞한다.＜102＞
