**Body Text Translation:**
Down by the willow garden
I met my love,
My love passed through the willow garden
With little feet white as snow.
Like the leaves budding on the tree,
My love said love is easy to fade,
But I was young and foolish,
And thus, did not listen to my love's words.

In the field lying by the riverbank
I stood with my love,
My love placed her hand, white as snow,
Upon my bowed shoulder.
Like the grass growing on the bank,
My love said life is easy to fade,
And thus, now tears of remembrance flow from my eyes. <37>

**Summary**

This article is a Korean translation of W. B. Yeats' poem "Down by the Salley Gardens," translated by "Oksaeng" (億生). The poem recounts a speaker's memories of a past love, marked by youthful foolishness and regret for not heeding the lover's warnings about the transience of love and life, leading to present sorrow. For historians, the publication of a translation of an Irish poet's work in a prominent Korean cultural magazine like *Kaebyŏk* (개벽) during the early Japanese colonial period (1922) is significant. It demonstrates continued Korean engagement with Western literature and culture, and the choice of Yeats, from a nation with its own history of struggle against a larger power, might have resonated subtly with Korean intellectuals navigating their own colonial reality.

버들동산 (W. B. Yeats)
						億生
버드나무의 동산가에서
나는 내 님과 맛나엿노라,
내 님은 눈인 듯 하이한 적은 발로
버드나무동산을 지내 갓서라,
나무에 도다나는 닙과도가티
사랑은 슬어지기 쉽다고 내 님은 말하여라,
그러나, 나는 어리고 어리석엇노라,
이리하야 내 님의 말을 듯지 안핫노라.

江물가에 누엇는 벌판에
나는 내 님과 섯섯노라,
내 님은 눈인 듯 하이한 그 손을
나의 숙인 억개에 언젓서라,
언덕가에 자라는 풀과도가티
목슴은 슬어지기 쉽다고 내 님은 말하여라,
이리하야 只今 내 눈에는 追懷의 눈물이, 흘러라.＜37＞
