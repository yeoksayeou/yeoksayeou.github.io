Significant Rain
						Kwŏn Tŏkkyu

Rain comes
Pitter-patter, rain comes
For a while, low pressure
Suggested rain might come, and indeed
Right away, that
Turned into rain.

Rain comes
Pouring down, rain comes
Still at winter’s end<22>
If it froze, wouldn’t it be snow? But
Right away, that
Turned into rain.

Rain comes
Rain comes for days on end
If spring rain comes
How long would it last, I wondered, but
Right away, that
Turned into a long rain.

Rain comes
Drip, drip, drop, it comes well
At first, that rain
What meaning could it have, I wondered, but
Right away, that
Is becoming such a rain.

Rain comes
Slanting rain comes
That which gently poured
Gradually, gradually grows fiercer
Right away, that
Is becoming such a rain.

Rain comes
That rain comes, it comes
No matter how I think about it
That rain, some great event
It seems determined to cause
That rain comes, it comes.

Rain comes
That rain, that rain
As if significant, yet seemingly not
That rain, from the start
Was not such an insignificant
Kind of rain.

Rain comes
That rain comes
To all things, sentient and insentient
As if trying to affect everything
That, right away
Turned into that rain.<23>

**Summary**

The poem "Significant Rain" by Kwŏn Tŏkkyu describes the arrival and persistence of rain, beginning gently and growing stronger and more ominous. The speaker observes the rain's transformation from an expected weather event into something prolonged and seemingly purposeful, pondering its meaning and potential to cause a "great event." The repetition of "rain comes" emphasizes its relentless nature, while the shift in tone suggests growing unease or anticipation. From a historical perspective, the poem, written in 1922 during the Japanese colonial period, might be interpreted allegorically. The persistent, intensifying rain could symbolize the oppressive colonial atmosphere, growing discontent, or the anticipation of significant social or political change, reflecting the anxieties and subdued hopes of the time.
