The rain comes indeed
Coming yesterday and today
With one drop, the snow melts
With two drops, the ice melts
The starkly frozen
Snow and ice are entirely gone

The rain comes indeed
Coming yesterday and today
With one stream, the embankment breaks through
With two streams, the ground thaws
Anywhere, in any valley
Obstructions are entirely gone

The rain comes indeed
Coming yesterday and today
With one day's rain, the bugs live
With one night's rain, the water rises
Things that slept all winter
None remain unwoken entirely

The rain comes indeed
Coming yesterday and today
With one day's rain, winter is chased away
With two days' rain, spring is welcomed
Throughout the whole world, in anything
There is nothing but newness entirely

The rain comes indeed
Coming yesterday and today
With one drop, one stream
Night and day, one day, two days
Things thought of and prepared
Nothing remains unachieved entirely<22>

**Summary**

This poem, "First Rain," by Kwŏn Tŏkkyu celebrates the arrival of spring rain after a long winter. The rain, falling persistently over days, melts the snow and ice, thaws the frozen ground, awakens dormant life like insects, chases away winter, and ushers in spring. The poem emphasizes a sense of complete renewal and the overcoming of obstacles, culminating in the idea that the rain allows for the fulfillment of long-prepared plans. From a historical perspective, the poem, published in 1922 during the Japanese colonial period, can be interpreted as expressing a yearning for national renewal and liberation, symbolized by the powerful, life-giving spring rain washing away the harsh "winter" of oppression. The overwhelming sense of totality ("entirely gone," "entirely," "nothing but") reinforces the desire for a complete transformation.

첫비
						權德奎
비가옴도 올사
어제오고 오늘오고
한방울에 눈이녹고
두방울에 얼음녹아
쌀쌀이도 앙당그렷든
눈과얼음 全혀업다

비가옴도 올사
어제오고 오늘오고
한줄기에 내뚤히고
두줄기에 땅이풀려
아무곳 아무골에고
막힘이란 全혀업다

비가옴도 올사
어제오고 오늘오고
한낫비에 버레살고
한밤비에 물이올라
겨으내 잠자든것
안깨난것 全혀업다

비도옴도 올사
어제오고 오늘오고
하루비에 겨을쫏고
읻흘비에 봄을맞어
온누리 아무것에고
새로움이 全혀이라

비도옴도 올사
어제오고 오늘오고
한방울 한줄기
밤낮하루읻흘에
생각고 磨鍊한것
못닐운것 全혀업다＜22＞
