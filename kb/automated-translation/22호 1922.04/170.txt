A Word Upon Starting This Manuscript

We call ourselves a people who have inherited an aesthetic nature and inherently possess artistic skill, excelling in creativity. We do not hesitate to boast to the world that we are an art nation.

The Jewish people believed their responsibility was to build God's kingdom on Earth; the Greek people made the propagation of arts and scholarship their duty; the Roman people took it upon themselves to be the emperors of the world. What about us, Korea?
As the wheels of history have turned for over 4,000 years, we have made the creation of brilliant art our heaven-sent duty.

For us, whose heaven-sent duty lies herein, is it not our utmost shame that we still do not possess even a single volume of art history to this day? Indeed, it is something to lament unbearably.
The ancient times are vague and unascertainable. Since Tan'gun, it is a fact that our culture, observed as a whole, has progressed steadily. Accompanying this, passing through the Three Han and Three Kingdoms periods, and reaching the Unified Silla and Koryŏ periods, there is a clear path of development and transition in architecture, sculpture, painting, etc.
Should we investigate exhaustively its origins through careful consideration? Since the late Koryŏ period through the Yi Dynasty—let alone gradual improvement—it reached the extreme of decadence, and now even the nimble divine talent has become forgotten. Should we describe this to explore the source of its decline?

For us, regardless of the subject, systematic research following a lineage has been scarce. Since it is not something that can be successfully achieved with easy effort, it is not unreasonable that such writings have not appeared, but politics, religion, etc., each do not lack historical records. As a people who even consider themselves an art nation,<13> how can we possibly allow there not to be even a brief record of this? Truly, the compilation of an art history is an urgent task for the present time.

We earnestly hope that the great scholars and masters of this field will rise up and take up their pens to save us and guide the younger generation. Would this endeavor not be for the revival of the peninsula's people and a contribution to the world's academic community? Enabling the knowledge of the new through the study of the old lies herein.
It is immensely gratifying that recently, young aspiring patriots, awakening to their far-reaching aspirations for self-reliance and self-respect, show a situation where many also pay attention to this. Is this not also the dawn of our people's return?

Although I, with my narrow view and shallow knowledge, have not neglected to immerse myself in the observation of this during my leisure from studies, how could one person possibly cover the East and West, ancient and modern? However, if I were to abandon this, deeming it beyond my capacity, and ignore it entirely, would it not only lead to greater confusion and obscurity? What is to be done?
Therefore, I am merely arranging what I, with still little consideration and incomplete research, have gathered and obtained out of a desire to know.

Why does the responsibility for writing even this incomplete short piece fall upon my foolish and clumsy self? Alas, are there scholarly friends who share the same sentiment? Recalling this, I cannot suppress the surge of hot blood welling up from deep lamentation and admiration. Young people who share the same aspiration! This is not something one person can complete, nor can it be completed overnight. Corresponding to its importance, the degree of difficulty is only more severe. Therefore, if only those with the same interest and agreeing intent gather, organize a compilation committee, and divide the labor according to their respective strengths, then perhaps we can expect great achievement.

Next, it is our custom that among art objects worthy of study, more than half are hidden away in the secret storehouses of the wealthy. Let them be made public.
Is the existence of art objects to be dictated by money? Is the value of something called art like that? The world of ideals departed this realm long ago. Art objects are not utilitarian items; by their very nature, they should be made public. Consider that even in a single scroll painting, even in a single sculpture, the emotions and nature of the entire people of that era are expressed as a crystallization.

Is it because they are precious and important that they are displayed only at private celebratory banquets, seeking praise solely among acquaintances? Truly, because they are precious and important, take them out from the dark caves<14> to avoid the calamities of insects and rats, and plan for the enjoyment of all people.
If this is not done, then they become enemies of art, not our patriots. For the sake of the nation, for the sake of the world, let those important and precious treasure troves be opened. Let those treasure troves be opened to provide resources for the research of our comrades.
Though my words may seem excessively harsh, if one understands the intention behind them given our current situation, that too would be fortunate.

A Historical Study of Korean Art =(Korean Art History - Unfinished Manuscript)=

Chapter 1: General Introduction

In discussing our art history, we must first say a word about its outline: its position in world art history, the characteristics and formative factors of Korean art, and the difficulties in its study.

Section 1: Position in World Art History

Just as European art, influenced by Christianity, took shape and manifested in the body as an outflow of gratitude and admiration, bowing to its profound love and lofty reverence, and was simultaneously drawn to the powerful and brilliant culture of the Aryan people, achieving the great European art of today; so too, Eastern art, escaping the filthy lands of the nine sorrows and relieving the suffering of the three realms, aiming to save all sentient beings with boundless great compassion through the teachings of Buddha, formed amidst the ecstasy beyond words and brush, where a single pulse of spiritual energy connected, emerging from the vastness. This Eastern art, escaping its birthplace, India, spread northwards into Central Asia, extended eastwards into China, and gradually advanced, ultimately being gathered and contained within the nimble artistic wellspring of the Hibiscus Peninsula (Korea). That its essence came to fruition here is fitting for comparison with the art of both East and West.

In the past, when art had not yet escaped its fetters and wandered under restraint, art and religion had an inseparable relationship. The lofty and distant atmosphere, the exquisite and elegant style of St. Peter's Basilica—causing those who see the sanctuary today to suddenly feel divine inspiration, solemnly adjust their collars, and reach a state of ecstatic selflessness—was it not the embodiment of the reverence and piety towards the Heavenly Emperor by Michelangelo, who refused all payment for the construction, saying, "I exhaust my heart and strength for God; why should I require reward from worldly people?" What else<15> could it be sought from?
Religion was also the harmonizer of art, and our art is one example of this category. The Samguk Sagi states:
In the 2nd year of King Sosurim of Koguryŏ, summer, 6th month, King Fu Jian of Qin sent an envoy and the monk Shun-tao, delivering Buddhist statues and scriptures. The King sent an envoy back with tribute in gratitude.
The 2nd year of King Sosurim is 372 AD. From this time, Buddhism was transmitted to our country. In the 4th year of the same king, the monk A-tao returned from Jin. The Samguk Sagi states:
In the 5th year, spring, 2nd month, he first founded Ch'omun Monastery to place Shun-tao, and also founded Ibullan Monastery to place A-tao. This is the beginning of Buddhism in Haedong (Korea).
Was it our extraordinary disposition, excelling in creative characteristics whether in religion or art? How could Buddhism, equipped with solemn and subtle doctrines, have hesitated in its propagation? The king greatly promoted temples, lavishly created Buddhist statues and scriptures, and the two monks, Shun-tao and A-tao, devoted themselves to preaching and missionary work. Before long, it spread throughout the land with the force of a bursting river.
Consequently, it brought about a great transformation in art history, not only in architecture and sculpture but also in painting, casting, etc.

Prior to this, China had barbarian tribes from beyond the frontiers called the Five Barbarians (五胡). This refers to the five groups—Xiongnu, Jie, Xianbei, Di, and Qiang—who had migrated into central China and were temporarily powerful. These tribes increased further during the Han and Three Kingdoms periods, reaching the early Jin dynasty. Taking advantage of Jin's decline, they rose in rebellion, destroyed the Western Jin, and occupied the entire area north of the Yangtze River. A branch of the Jin family moved south, established their capital at Jiankang, and barely managed to hold onto the land south of the river. From the end of Western Jin, the Five Barbarians fought incessantly among themselves for hegemony for 130 years, during which sixteen kingdoms rose and fell. The Qin state, which transmitted Buddhism to our Koguryŏ, was one of them. This was when King Fu Jian of Qin unified the Five Barbarians, made neighboring states pay tribute, and demonstrated the power to rule the world.
The Buddhism of this Five Barbarian period is what is called Northern Buddhism. The source of the transmission of Northern Buddhism lies far away in Gandhara (간다라) in Northern India. Therefore, the Buddhism sent by King Fu Jian of Qin, let alone that of the Five Barbarians, must have been Northern Buddhism transmitted from Gandhara, and furthermore, the Buddhist statues and scriptures must have been the same.

Here, taking another step forward to meticulously examine the Buddhist teachings of the Gandhara region, and especially its art such as architecture and sculpture, to clarify its origin, which marks a major stage in our art history, is also indispensable. This is why I intend to discuss it next.<16>
In 327 BC, King Alexander of Macedonia, having already pacified Greece, received the submission of various Asian states and advanced eastwards, crossing the Indus River, intending to invade India next. However, with his army tens of thousands of miles away, the officers and soldiers all ardently desired to return home and did not wish to advance further. Alexander thus abandoned his long-held ambition and returned, dividing his forces into land and naval contingents. Since then, Alexander sought to establish the foundation of a great empire straddling East and West by importing the Greek language and arts, and fusing races, customs, religions, etc., but before the opportune moment for implementation arrived, he unfortunately died of a fever in the city of Babylon. Afterwards, as the territory fractured, the Indian domains fell into the hands of King Seleucus Nicator of Syria. At that time, King Chandragupta of Magadha in India was the most powerful. Seleucus, thinking it would be difficult to rival him, ceded his Indian territories to Chandragupta, gave his daughter in marriage to become the queen of the Magadha king, and sought to maintain peace between the two countries. However, not long after, someone established a new country within Seleucus' territory. That king was called Eucratides, and his country was called the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom. He attacked Syria and turned to invade India, and his territory was indeed vast.
Later, during the reign of King Menandros, his territory expanded further southeast. After the death of King Menandros, internal strife among the Greeks caused the Greek kingdom in Bactria to lose its power, and finally, around 70 BC, it was destroyed by the Indo-Scythians (印度스키덴), namely the Yuezhi.

Among the monarchs of the Greek kingdom, the one who was influential as a mediator between Eastern and Western civilizations in India was King Menandros. The king was the so-called King Milinda of the Buddhists; the king himself was also a Buddhist. That such a powerful monarch as King Menandros still converted to Buddhism suggests that at that time, interaction between Greek and Indian civilizations must have been even more vigorous throughout the Indus River basin region of India, which can be well imagined. Moreover, the interaction between these two great civilizations did not begin only in this Menandros era. Recalling that it originated in the late 3rd century BC, during the time of interaction between Seleucus Nicator and King Chandragupta of Magadha, and subsequently inferring that the relationship between India and Greece became even closer due to the rise of the Bactrian kingdom over 300 years, and considering all these facts together, one can deduce that the interaction between the two civilizations was already very close around the 1st century BC. Furthermore, influencing other lands with one's own civilization is a major characteristic of the Greeks. The fact that "Hellenization" accompanied<17> King Alexander's conquests everywhere is well recognized by historians. One aspect of this Greek approach was to equate the indigenous deities of each land with their own gods. Trying to represent Buddha by adapting the image of the latter, likening Buddha to the god Apollo, stems from this reason. At the same time, the influence from India reaching Greece must not have been insignificant either. It goes without saying that the Buddhist theory of reincarnation helped shape later Greek philosophy, and the entry of indigenous Indian parables and the like into Greece is another example.
As mutual interaction gradually developed at that time, numerous explorers and adventurers emerged, and it is also a fact that they transmitted the novelty of each other's customs and culture. Although the Greek kingdom of Bactria perished, the brilliant civilization of Greece was nevertheless sustained by the victors, the Scythians, namely the Yuezhi, and developed within Buddhist culture. The most powerful monarch among the Indo-Scythian dynasties was King Kanishka. The king's domain was truly vast, occupying the land from the Aral Sea in Central Asia far away to the Indus River basin region in northwestern India. Furthermore, King Kanishka, along with Ashoka of Magadha, is famous as a protector of Buddhism. His major achievement was convening monks from various Buddhist schools, holding a great council, harmonizing different theories and disputes, and carrying out the Third Council (結集) of Buddhist scriptures. As a result of this council, the scriptures were all compiled in Sanskrit, and the previously used Pāḷi and Magadha languages fell into disuse, giving rise to the two major schools of Buddhism, North and South. The one modeled on the council is the Northern Mahāyāna Buddhism, which is the one transmitted to China and Korea. However, the Southern Buddhists did not participate in King Kanishka's great council and continued to revere the traditional scriptures as before. This is the Southern Buddhism that survives today in Burma, Siam, Cambodia, and the island of Ceylon. The time of King Kanishka was one of the peak periods of Buddhism in India. The fact that Greek civilization, inherited from the Greco-Bactrian kingdom, also developed in conjunction with Buddhism can be imagined from the relics of Buddhist statues and temples found today in the Gandhara region. The Buddhist art in this region is what art historians commonly call "Gandhara art"—the purest model of the so-called Greco-Buddhist style (Indo-Greek style). Later, the Indo-Scythian kingdom, namely the Yuezhi, suffered continuous internal strife from the 3rd to the 4th century AD and was eventually destroyed by the Indians. Buddhism declined concurrently. Therefore, although the influence of the Indo-Greek style was diminished, it still maintained a clear distinction from the purely Indian style found in southern India. The above concerns the relationship between Greece and India. Next, what was the relationship between India, especially Northern India, and China?<18>
The Xiongnu, who caused the heaven-shaking, earth-moving Qin Shi Huang to build the Great Wall, were truly also a monstrous enemy for successive Han dynasties. Emperor Wu dispatched Zhang Qian to the Yuezhi in India to propose an alliance for a pincer attack on the Xiongnu. Although this goal was not achieved, this marked the first recorded contact between India and China in history. Through this, the customs and conditions of the Western Regions were observed in detail, and the fusion of cultures between the two sides began. Also, Emperor Ming of the Later Han, after pacifying the rebellious Xiongnu, established the Protectorate General in the Western Regions and had Ban Chao personally govern the various areas of the Western Regions, so its influence extended far beyond the frontiers. The Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, having heard reports of the wealth and power of the Later Han state, dispatched an envoy by sea in 166 AD and communicated with the Later Han. Since then, traffic between the East and West began, and Roman merchants came to the present-day Tonkin region and engaged vigorously in trade. Also, during Emperor Ming's time, Cai Yin was dispatched to the Yuezhi to seek Buddhist teachings. In the 10th year of Yongping (永和 10年) of Emperor Ming (67 AD, approx. 600 years after Buddha's enlightenment), this Buddhism finally reached China. The establishment of temples and the translation of Buddhist scriptures gradually flourished, and after about 350 years, it was transmitted to Koguryŏ. These, of course, imported the art of the Gandhara region. Later, around the 5th century, Fa Xian of the Eastern Jin set out from Chang'an, entered Central Asia via Gansu, went south to the Indian peninsula, and returned by sea from northeastern India, bringing Buddhist scriptures and statues. These too would have been made in the Gandhara style. Viewed from this perspective, the Korean art imported from Qin during the Five Barbarians period was undoubtedly also of the Gandhara style, i.e., the Indo-Greek style.

The above is a historical observation of the transmission of Buddhism. What confirms the correctness of these observations is the comparative study of relics; the ancient tombs of the Koguryŏ period are one example. The structure of the burial chamber ceiling and the method of constructing the entrance passage are designated as purely Greek style. The murals, especially the patterns, are said to transmit its design and technique. The customs depicted in the figure paintings and their clothing are almost entirely Greek style, showing that the Indo-Greek style of Gandhara arose early in our country. Thus, our art, simultaneously with the transmission of Buddhism, received the influence of both Indian and Greek civilizations. So, what about the south?
In the first year of King Ch'imnyu of Paekche, the foreign monk Maranant'a came from Jin. The king welcomed him into the palace and treated him with respect. In the second year, second month, he founded a Buddhist temple at Hansan and ordained ten monks. This is the beginning of Paekche Buddhism.
In the first year of King Ch'imnyu (384 AD), Buddhism was first transmitted to Paekche, 12 years later than Koguryŏ. This too came<19> from Jin, so the first temple founded at Hansan would also have been architecture following the Gandhara lineage. In Silla, during the reign of King Nulchi, the monk Chŏngbang came from Koguryŏ but met with misfortune. Later,
During the reign of King Nulchi, the monk Mukhōja came from Koguryŏ to Ilsŏn-gun. A local man named Morye built a cave dwelling in his house to accommodate him. At that time, Liang sent an envoy with incense among the gifts. The court officials did not know the name of the incense or its use. They sent people around asking about the incense. Mukhōja saw it, stated its name and purpose, saying, "If this is burned, its fragrance spreads, thereby conveying sincerity to the divine and sacred. Among the divine and sacred, none surpass the Three Jewels: one, the Buddha; two, the Dharma; three, the Sangha. If you burn this and make a vow, there will surely be a spiritual response." At that time, the king's daughter was critically ill. The king had Mukhōja burn the incense and make a vow. The princess's illness soon healed. The king was greatly pleased and bestowed exceptionally generous gifts.
It was transmitted from Koguryŏ, so broadly speaking, all revered Northern Buddhism, and consequently, the art must have been that of Gandhara.

During the time of King Chinhŭng,
In the fifth year, spring, second month, Hŭngnyunsa Temple was completed. In the third month, people were permitted to leave home to become monks and nuns and follow Buddhism.
The flourishing of Buddhism can be inferred. Moreover,
The king ascended the throne in childhood and single-mindedly devoted himself to Buddhism. In his later years, he cut his hair, wore monk's robes, called himself Pŏbun, and lived out his life as such. The queen also followed his example, became a nun, and resided at Yŏnghŭngsa Temple.
How could a young king of 7 years old single-mindedly devote himself to Buddhism and, in his later years, cut his hair, don monk's robes, and practice the life of a monk? Truly, although Buddhism was transmitted to Silla later than to Koguryŏ and Paekche, it is not without reason that it far surpassed the two kingdoms in terms of propagation and widespread dissemination. It is needless to say that it received much influence from the cultures of Jin, Liang, Sui, and Tang. Among these, the direct transmission of Indian culture and artifacts by numerous monks who sought the Dharma was prevalent. The famous author of the "Record of the Western Regions," Hsüan-tsang, was a Tang person. At that time, Buddhism in the Gandhara region was gradually declining, and heterodox Brahmanical practices coexisted. However, since he traveled overland both ways, Tang Buddhist art must also have been influenced by the Gandhara region. Āryavarman, who stayed at Nalanda Monastery with Hsüan-tsang, was also a Silla person. Hyeryun, who stayed at Sandasa Temple in Gandhara; Hyŏn'gak and Hyŏnjo, who stayed at Mahabodhi Temple in West India; and Hyehŏp, who resided at Porisa Temple, were all Silla people. They were travelers who sought the Dharma and transmitted its culture back home. Ŭisin of Pŏpchusa Temple on Songnisan during King Chinhŭng's reign is said to have gone directly to India and returned with Buddhist scriptures and statues loaded on a white mule. Since it was an overland route, he must have entered through Central Asia and brought back art objects from Gandhara. Conversely, many Indian monks also came east to transmit the Dharma. Examples include Paedalda Samjang, who accompanied Kyŏmik, the founder of the Paekche Vinaya school, and co-translated 72 volumes of the Vinaya Piṭaka;<20> and Yŏn'gi Samjang, who first founded Hwaŏmsa Temple on Chirisan in Silla. Besides these, there were countless others, and every generation had such figures.
Literature, art, and music were transmitted. Not only architecture, painting, sculpture, casting, etc., but even weaving, leatherworking, and gardening all arose vigorously. At that time, Silla already possessed Three Great National Treasures that even enemy countries feared:
One: The 16-foot Buddha statue of Hwangnyongsa Temple from King Chinhŭng's reign (Bronze, 35,007 kŭn; Gold, 10,198 pun).
Two: The Jade Belt of King Chinp'yŏng (Length: 10 wi).
Three: The Pagoda of Punhwangsa Temple from Queen Sŏndŏk's reign (Finial, 42 ch'ŏk; Pagoda body, 183 ch'ŏk).
After the destruction of Paekche and Koguryŏ, as interactions between Silla and Tang gradually ceased, independent works of art based on the peninsula's inherent aesthetic design emerged in various forms, from architecture to sculpture. During King Sinmun's reign, temples like Pulguksa and Paengnimsa flourished. During King Aejang's reign, Haeinsa was founded, and during King Hŭngdŏk's reign, Pŏmŏsa arose. Due to successive wars and long years of ruin, the brilliant works of that era are hard to find, but the Tabot'ap and Sŏkkat'ap pagodas at Pulguksa Temple in Kyŏngju are already acclaimed by people. The stupa at Hwaŏmsa Temple on Chirisan, the hexagonal multi-storied pagoda at Kŭmsansa Temple in Kŭmje—how could they not convey divine mystery? Besides these, for sculpture, what about the stele of King T'aejong Muyŏl in Kyŏngju, the Buddha and Bodhisattva images inside Sŏkkuram Grotto at Pulguksa Temple? And for casting, the bronze bells of Sangwŏnsa Temple in P'yŏngch'ang and Pongdŏksa Temple in Kyŏngju? As the innate artistic genius, following the stirrings of its unique divine will and the movement of its spiritual skill, masterpieces and divine works emerged side by side. How could they be merely praised as absolute treasures of the world's art garden and nothing more? Having already absorbed the legends of the Greek style, embraced India, and incorporated China, our art, based on the truth of the East and adding the charm of Greece, was created. Our peninsula's art was truly born from the transformation of many schools and the merging of streams. The essence of Eastern art began to blossom from here. When this vibrant artistic wellspring was shaken, its spiritual resonance came alive wherever it touched. How could it have stopped only within the peninsula? Flowing eastwards once, it built Shitennōji Temple and Hōryūji Temple in Japan (扶桑國). The creators of the golden age in their art history were none other than our Paedal (Korean) people. Considering that Japan's Prince Shōtoku, revered for propagating Buddhism, received the five precepts from the Koguryŏ monk Hyeja, and because of this, over 40 temples were founded within a generation, it is clear without asking. Is the mural painting in the Golden Hall (Kondō) of Hōryūji, the epitome of Japanese art, not the wondrous work of Tamjing of Koguryŏ? Is the portrait of Prince Shōtoku not the remaining ink of Asa of Paekche? Even children know that the chief caster of the Great Buddha of Nara, Kuninaka no Muraji Kimimaro (text has 中國連公麻呂), was a descendant of a Paekche person, and Ha Sŏng (河成?), the fountainhead of Heian period artists, was also a Paekche person. The art of the peninsula, based from the southeastern archipelago to the northwestern wilderness, thus became the elite flower of Eastern culture. Subsequently, through the Koryŏ period to the present day, the art that has occupied a leading position in world art history has also been extraordinary like this. =(To be continued)=<21>

**Summary**

Pak Chong-hong argues passionately for the creation of a comprehensive history of Korean art, lamenting its absence despite Korea's self-perception as an "art nation." He outlines a historical trajectory, emphasizing the crucial role of Buddhism, introduced via China but originating from Indian Gandharan art (influenced by Greco-Bactrian culture), in shaping Korean art from the Three Kingdoms period. He highlights the fusion of these external influences with inherent Korean artistic talent, leading to unique masterpieces during Unified Silla and Koryŏ, and notes the transmission of this art to Japan. He calls for collaborative scholarly effort and urges collectors to make artworks accessible. From a colonial history perspective, the article is significant for its assertion of a distinct and valuable Korean artistic identity and history during a period of Japanese rule. It reflects a burgeoning cultural nationalism, seeking to establish Korea's historical importance and artistic genius, positioning it as a key player in East Asian art history and even a contributor to world art, implicitly countering colonial narratives that might diminish Korean cultural achievements.

朝鮮美術의 史的考察=(第1回)=
						朴鍾鴻
稿를 起하며 一言

吾人은 스스로 審美的 天性를 禀傳하며 美術的 기교를 本有하야 創造에 特長한 民族이라 自稱하도다. 스스로 美術國이라고 世界에 自誇함을 마지 아니 하도다.
猶太人은 神의 天國을 地上에 建設함으로써 그의 責任으로 信하얏고 希臘人은 文藝學術의 廣布로써 그의 本務를 作하얏스며 羅馬人은 天下의 帝王으로써 自任하얏나니 우리朝鮮은 如何한가?
有史以來 4千餘의 歲輪이 換轉할 새 그 燦爛하다는 美術의 造成으로써 吾人의 天職을 삼아 오도다.
天職이 在此한 吾人으로서 今日에 至하기까지 尙且 一部의 美術史를 不有함은 吾人의 無上한 差恥가 아닐가. 果然 痛嘆할 不堪하는 바-로다.
太古時代는 漠然하야 不可考라, 檀君以來 吾人의 文化가 全軆上으로 觀察하매 滔滔히 進行하야 왓슴은 事實이라, 그와 伴하야 三韓時代와 三國時代를 經하고 新羅統一時代로부터 高麗時代에 瓦하야, 建築, 彫刻, 繪畵 等 歷然한 그의 發達變遷의 經路를 有하도다.
推考하야써 그의 所出來를 究盡할지요, 高麗末期로부터 李朝以來-漸次 向上은 姑捨하고 頹廢를 極하야 今에 그 靈活하다던 神才까지도 沒覺함에 至하니 此를 敍述하야써 그의 墮落된 源을 探解할지라.
우리에게 何者를 莫論하고 組織的으로 系統을 隨하야, 硏究함이 稀少하얏도다. 容易한 心勞로써 成功될 者-아닐 새 그 著述의 不出함도 無理한 事는 아니어니와 政治, 宗敎 等은 各其 史乘에 不乏하도다. 美術國으로 自處까지＜13＞ 하는 吾人으로서 어찌 此에게만 如斯히 一篇의 略記도 無하고 可하랴. 實로 美術史의 編纂은 時下의 急務로다.
敢히 斯學의 碩學大家가 吾人을 救하기 爲하야 더욱 後進을 導하기 爲하야 奮然執筆함을 切望하는 바-니, 是擧가 半島의 民族復活을 爲함이 아니며 世界의 學術界에 貢獻함이 아니리오. 溫古로써 新을 知케 함이 此에 在하도다.
昨今에 비롯오 新進靑年志士의 그 自立自尊의 遠大한 抱負를 覺悟하매 此에 意를 留하는 者-亦 多한 現狀을 呈하야 옴은 欣辛을 不勝하는 바-어니와 이 또한 다시 還來한 우리民族의 曙光이 아니랴.
狹見淺識의 予로서 學牕의 餘暇를 不懈하야 平素 此의 觀察에 潛心치 아님은 아니나 一個人으로서 어찌 能히 東西古今을 歷涉할 바-리오, 然이나 不敢當이라고 棄放하야 一次 此를 不顧한다하면 尤混尤昧할뿐임에 奈何오.
是以로 아즉 考察이 少하고 硏鑽이 不完全한 予의 다만 알고자 하야 採集求得한 바-를 排列하여 보게 됨이라.
이 不完全한 小篇의 著筆이나 愚拙한 予에게로 그 責任이 歸함은 何故인고, 嗚呼 感을 同히 하는 學友가 在한가, 予는 이를 想起함에 深切한 嘆仰裡에서 湧出하는 熱血의 激動을 스스로 禁치 못하는 바-로다. 志를 同히 하는 靑年人士여, 此는 一個人의 可히 完成할 바-아니오, 一朝一夕으로 可히 完成될 者-아니라. 그 소중함을 隨하야 困難의 層度는 尤甚할뿐이라. 故로 다만 趣가 同하며 意가 合하는 者의 相會로써 卽 그의 編纂會를 組織하고 各其 所長을 隨하야 그 苦勞를 分한다 하면 庶乎大成을 期할 者-라 하노라.
次에 吾人의 慣習으로 美術品 中 考究에 値할만한 者는 過半이 富豪의 秘庫裡에 隱匿되어 잇슴을 公開하라 함이라.
美術品의 存在가 金錢에 依하야 左右됨이여, 美術이라는 者는 그 價値가 爾然한 者인가, 理想의 世는 此界를 辭한지 已久하도다. 實用物이 아닌 美術品이라, 그 本質上 此를 公開할지어다. 비록 一幅의 畵에도 一基의 彫刻에도 當時代 民族全軆의 情과 性의 結晶이 表現되엇슴을 思하라.
貴且重함으로 自賀宴席에나 展列하야 오즉 知人間의 稱揚을 求함인가, 實로 貴且重한 고로 蟲鼠의 難을 免토록＜14＞ 幽窟內에서 持出하야 萬人의 共樂을 圖할지어다.
萬若 不然타 하면 그는 美術의 敵이 될지오. 우리의 志士가 아닐지라. 民族을 爲하야 世界를 爲하야 重且貴한 그 寶庫를 公開할 지어다. 우리同志의 硏究의 資에 充토록 그 寶庫를 公開할지어다.
言이 비록 激한데 失한 듯하나 吾人의 現狀으로 오즉 其意의 存한 바-를 諒한다 하면 또한 幸일진뎌.

朝鮮美術의 史的 考察 =(朝鮮美術史-未定稿)=

第1章 總論

우리의 美術史를 論述함에는 먼저 그의 輪廓인 世界美術史上의 位置, 朝鮮美術의 特色과 成因, 硏究上의 困難을 一言치 아니치 못할지라.

第1節 世界美術史上의 位置

彼歐洲의 美術이 基督敎的 感化를 受하야 그의 深玄한 慈愛와 高遠한 畏敬에 歎服되여 感謝와 欽仰의 流露로써 形을 成하며 軆에 現하는 同時에 「아리얀」民族의 强大燦爛한 文化에 誘引되여 今日의 彼歐洲의 美術을 大成한 者와 如히 九憂의 穢士를 流離하며 三界의 苦腦를 濟하야 圓滿無邊의 大慈悲로써 一切 衆生을 度코저 하는 佛陀의 敎化, 言絶筆斷인 恍惚之間에 一脈의 靈氣가 相通하야 茫然之中에  做出成來한 東洋美術이 그의 發生地인 印度를 脫出하야 北으로 中央亞細亞에 蔓하고 東으로 中國에 延하야 漸次 趨進할 새 畢竟은 槿花半島의 靈活한 美術的 才源에 具收含蓄되매 玆에 그 精華를 結하게 된 것은 東西兩洋의 美術을 對比함에 適合할 者-라.
美術이 아즉 羈絆的임을 未免하고 그 拘束下에서 徘徊하던 前日에는 美術과 宗敎와는 不可離할 關係를 有한 者-니 「센트피타」寺院의 高大悠遠한 氣韻, 精妙秀雅한 風致 今에 其堂을 見하는 者로 하야곰 神感이 忽起하야 肅然히 襟을 正齊하며 恍然히 忘己無我의 境에 至케 하는 者-「神을 爲하야 心力을 盡함이니 어찌 世人의 報酬를 要하랴」하고 修造의 報酬를 一切 拒絶한 「미카엘알졜로」의 天帝에 對한 畏信과 敬虔의 軆現한 者가 아니고 何에＜15＞ 求할 바-리오.
宗敎는 또한 美術의 融和者이엇나니 吾人의 美術도 此例中의 1이라. 三國史記에 曰
高句麗 小獸林王 2年 夏6月 秦王苻堅遺使及浮屠順道送佛像經文, 王遺使廻謝以貢物
小獸林王 2年은 西紀 372年이라. 是에 비롯오 佛敎가 我에 傳來하얏도다. 同 4年에 沙門 阿度가 晉으로부터 還來하니 史記에 曰
5年 春2月 始創肖門寺以置順道又創伊弗蘭寺以置阿道此海東佛法之始.
創造的 特性에 長하야 宗敎로든지 美術로든지 非凡한 우리의 素質인지라. 莊嚴微妙한 敎理를 具備한 佛敎-豈可以傳播함을 躊躇하얏슬 者-리오, 國王이 寺刹을 大興하며, 佛像과 佛經을 盛造하고 順道 阿道의 二僧이 說法, 傳道에 盡心할 새 未幾에 江河를 決하는 氣勢로 全土에 瀰滿한지라,
於是乎 建築彫刻은 勿論이오, 繪畵, 鑄造 等 美術史上에 一大變革을 生한지라.
先是에 中國은 五胡라 稱하는 塞外의 蠻族이 有하얏스니 中國內地에 移住하야 一時 强盛하얏든 凶奴, 羯, 鮮卑, 氏, 羌의 五者를 云함이라, 此等 種族은 兩漢三國時代를 經하야 晉初에 至하매 尤益增加하니 晉의 衰頹함에 미처 亂음 起하야 西晉을 滅하고 江北一帶를 占領한지라. 晉의 一族은 南下하야 建康에 都하고 僅히 江南의 地를 保守함에 至하얏도다, 西晉末부터 五胡가 互相覇權을 掌握코저 相攻不息하기 百三十年間에 亙하니 其間 興亡한 列國이 十六이라. 우리 高句麗에 佛法을 傳한 晉國도 그 中의 一이니, 晉王 符堅이 五胡를 統一한 後 四隣의 諸邦으로 하야곰 貢을 納케 하며 天下를 經營코저 하는 威勢를 示現하든 當時라.
此 五胡時代의 佛敎는 所謂 北方佛敎라 稱하는 者-요, 北方佛敎의 流傳의 源頭는 멀리 北印度 「간다라」(Gandhara)에 在한지라, 然則 五胡는 勿論이오, 晉王 苻堅의 送來한 佛法도 「간다라」에서 傳來한 北方佛敎일 것이며 더욱 佛像도 佛經도 亦然할 것이로다.
玆에 更히 一步를 進하야 「간다라」地方의 佛法, 더욱 建築, 彫刻 等 美術의 如何를 穿考하야 우리 美術史上에 一大 段階를 지어줄 그의 本源을 明確히 함은 또한 不可缺할 者이기로 次에 論究코저 하는 所以로다.＜16＞
紀元前 327年 「마케도니아」王 亞歷山이 이미 希臘을 平定한 後 亞細亞의 諸邦을 降服밧고 東進하야 「인더스」河를 渡涉하야 將次 印度로 侵入코저 한지라, 然而 懸軍萬里, 將士가 擧皆歸國을 熱望하고 更進을 不欲할 새 歷山이 이에 宿志를 斷하고 水陸二軍으로 兩分하야 歸還하얏더라. 歷山은 이래 希臘의 言語, 文藝를 輸入하고 人種, 風俗, 宗敎 等을 融合하야써 東西兩洋에 跨한 大帝國의 基礎를 確立코저 하얏스나 아즉 實行의 運에 未知하고, 不幸히 熱病으로 「바비론」城中에 沒하니 其後 版圖가 分裂할새 印度의 諸領地는 「싀리아」王 「셀러코스니가톨」의 手에 入하얏다. 當時 印度의 摩喝陀王「챤드라구푸타」 其勢最强하니 「셀러코스」 可히 對敵키 難함을 想하야 그 印度의 領地를 「챤드라구푸타」에게 割讓하고 그의 女를 納하야 摩喝陀王의 妃를 삼아 兩國의 平和를 維持코저 하얏스나 不久에 「셀러코스」領地內에 새로이 一國을 建한 者가 有하얏슴이로다. 그 王을 「어크라티다스」라 云하고 其國을 希臘「바구도리아」王國이라 할새 「싀리아」를 略하고 轉하야 印度에 侵入하니 그의 領地는 果然 廣大하얏도다.
其後 「메난드로스」(Menandros)王에 至하야 그의 領土는 更히 東南으로 擴張하얏도다. 「메난드로스」王의 死後 希臘人間의 內訌은 「바구도리아」에 在한 希臘國으로 하야곰 그 勢力을 破壞케 하야 듸디어 紀元前 約 70年에 至하야는 印度「스키덴」(Indo-Skythen) 卽 月氏에게 滅하는 바-되엇도다.
希臘王國의 君主 中 印度에 在하야 東西文明의 媒介者로 有力한 것이 「메난드로스」王이라. 王은 佛敎徒의 所謂 「미린다」王이니 王 自身도 亦是 佛敎徒이엇도다. 如斯히 君主 中 가장 有力한 「메란드로스」王이고서 尙且 佛敎에 歸依하얏슨 卽 當時 「인더스」河 流域一帶의 印度地方에는 希臘文明과 印度文明과의 交涉이 一層 盛行하얏슬 것은 可히 想像함에 有餘할지도다. 又是 二大文明의 交涉이 다만 此「메난드로스」時代에 始初된 것은 아니니 紀元前 3世紀末 卽 「셀러코스니카톨」과, 摩喝陀王「챤드라구푸타」와의 交涉時代에 起源하얏슴을 想起하며 其後 300年間 「바구로리아」王國의 勃興에 依하야 印度와 希臘과의 關係가 一層 緊密을 加하얏슴을 推想할지오 此의 事實을 總考하면 紀元前 1世紀頃에 이미 兩國文明의 交涉이 甚히 親近하얏슴을 推察할지로다, 더욱 自國의 文明으로써 他邦의 感化함은 希臘人의 一大 特色이니 亞歷山王의 征服에는 到處에 「希臘化」라는 事實이＜17＞ 伴하얏슴은 史家의 夙認하는 바-라. 是 希臘의 一方便은 到處 그 邦土固有의 鬼神으로써 自國의 神에 比擬함에 在하도다. 佛陀를 「아포른」神에 擬하되 後者의 形象을 移하야 前者를 表現코저 함도 此故로써니 同時에 印度로부터 希臘에 及한 影響도 不少할지로다. 佛敎의 輪迴說이 後期의 希臘哲學을 做成케 하얏슴도 勿論이어니와 印度 固有의 譬喩談 等이 希臘에 入하얏슴도 그의 一例일지라.
當時 彼此의 交涉이 漸次 開展됨을 隨하야 幾多의 遠征家, 探險者를 出하니 互相間 그의 風俗文物의 新奇를 傳主하얏슴도 亦是 事實이라. 「바구도리아」의 希臘王國은 滅亡하얏스나, 希臘의 燦然한 文明은 尙且勝者인 「스키덴」人 卽 月氏로 因하야 持續되어 佛敎文化 中에서 發達하얏도다. 印度 「스키덴」王朝 中 最有力한 君主는 「카니싀카」(Kanishka)王이다. 王의 領域은 멀리 中央亞細亞의 「아랄」海로부터 印度의 西北部인 「더스」河 流域一帶의 地를 占하니 實로 廣大한 者이엇도다. 且「카니싀카」王은 摩喝陀의 阿育王과 共히 佛敎의 外護者로서 有名하니 其業의 主要한 者는 佛敎 各派의 僧侶를 招集하야 大會議를 開하고 異說爭論을 調和하야 佛敎經典의 第三結集을 行하얏슴이라, 此 結集의 結果 經典은 擧皆梵語로 編述되고 從來의 巴里語, 摩喝陀語는 廢棄함에 至하야 玆에 비롯오 佛敎의 南北 二大派를 生하게 되엇도다 結集을 標範으로한 者는 北方의 大乘佛敎니 中國, 朝鮮에 流傳한 者가 是也라, 然而 南方의 佛徒는 是「카니싀카」王의 大會議에도 不關하고 依然히 從來의 經典을 遵崇하얏나니 卽 今日 「비루마」 「샴」 「캄보댜」及 「세이론」島에 殘存한 南方佛敎가 其也라, 「카니싀카」王時는 印度의 佛敎 最盛時期의 一이라. 「바구도리아」의 希臘王國으로부터 傳襲된 希臘文明도 亦是 佛敎와 拘合發達하야온 事實은 今日 「간다라」地方에 在한 佛像, 佛寺의 遺物에 依하야 可히 상상할 바-로다. 此 地方에 在한 佛敎的 美術은 美術史家가 「간다라」美術이라 通稱하는 者-니 所謂 希臘佛敎式 (印度希臘式)의 가장 純粹한 標範이라. 其後 印度「스키덴」王國 卽 月氏는 紀元後 3世紀로부터 4世紀頃에 至하기까지 內亂이 續出하얏슴으로 듸디어 印度人에게 滅亡되엇스니 佛敎도 同時에 衰頹한 지라, 故로 印度希臘式도 그의 勢力이 感殺되엇다 할지나 尙且 南方印度에 在한 純然한 印度式과는 判然한 區別을 有하는 者-라. 以上은 希臘과 印度의 關係요. 次에 印度 더욱 北部印度와 中國과의 關係는 如何하얏는고.＜18＞
驚天撼地의 秦始皇으로 하야곰 萬里長城을 築造케 한 凶奴는 眞實로 漢家歷代의 또한 怪敵이엇도다. 武帝가 張騫을 印度月氏에 派遣하야써 凶奴의 夾擊을 同盟코저 하얏나니 비록 其志는 達치 못하얏스나 此가 歷史上 印度와 中國과의 交涉이 된 最初라. 此로 因하야 西域諸國의 風俗, 人情을 詳察하며 彼此 文物의 融合이 始開하얏도다. 또 後漢 明帝는 反亂한 凶奴를 平定한 後 西域에 都護府를 設하야 班超로 하야곰 親히 西域 諸地方을 統治케 하얏슴으로 그의 勢力이 멀리 塞外에 普及된지라. 羅馬皇帝 「마커스.오렐리아스」는 일즉 後漢國의 富强함을 傳聞하고 西紀 166年 海路使節을 發하야 後漢과 通한 以來로 東洋과 西洋의 交通이 始行하니 羅馬商人은 今의 「통킨」地方에 來하야 貿易을 盛行한지라 또 明帝時에 蔡愔을 月氏에 派有하야 佛法을 求하니 明帝永和 10年(西紀 6年, 佛陀成道 後 約 600)에는 此 佛敎가 듸디어 中國에도 傳來하고 寺院의 建立과 佛典의 飜譯과는 漸次 盛行함에 至하야스며 其後 約 350年을 經하야 高句麗에 傳來하얏도다. 是 等은 勿論 「간다라」地方의 美術을 輸入한 者이엇스며 其後 5世紀頃에 東晋 法顯이 長安을 發하야 甘肅으로 中央亞細亞에 入하고 印度半島로 南下하야 다시 印度東北部에서 海路로 歸來하니, 佛經, 佛像을 持할 새 此 亦 「간다라」美術로써 된 者일지라, 由是觀之컨대 五胡時代에 秦으로부터 輸入된 우리 朝鮮美術도 勿論 「간다라」樣式 卽 印度希臘式이엇슴도 無疑할지로다.
以上은 佛敎傳來의 歷史上 觀察이라. 是等 觀察의 正當함은 確證하는 者는 遺物의 比較硏究니 高句麗時代의 古墳이 그 一例라. 玄室天井의 構造, 羡道의 築造法은 純希臘式이라고까지 指稱하는 者-요. 그 壁畵 더욱 模樣은 그의 意匠과 手法을 傳한 者-라 云할지며 人物畵에 表現된 風俗과 그 衣裳의 幾許나 希臘式이 아님이 無하니 「간다라」의 印度希臘式의 我邦에 夙興하얏슴을 可知로다. 如斯히 우리 美術은 佛敎의 傳來와 同時에 印度와 希臘의 兩文明의 影響을 蒙하얏도다. 然則 南方은 如何하얏는가.
百濟枕流王元年, 胡僧摩羅難陀, 自晋至, 王迎致宮內敬禮, 至二年二月, 刱佛寺於漢山, 度僧十人, 此百濟釋敎之始也.
枕流王 元年(西紀 384)에 佛敎가 百濟에 始傳하니 高句麗보다 後하기 12年이오 是 亦 晋으로부터 渡來한＜19＞ 者인즉 漢山에 初刱한 佛寺도 「간다라」式의 系統을 取한 建築이엇슬지라, 新羅에는 訥祗王時 高句麗로부터 沙門正方이 至此하얏다가 遇害하고 其後
訥祗王時沙門墨胡子, 自高句麗至一善郡, 郡人毛禮, 於家中作窟室安置, 於時梁遺使衣著香物, 羣臣不知其香名與其所用, 遣人賞香徧問, 墨胡子見之, 稱其名目曰, 此焚之則香氣芬馥, 所以達誠於神聖, 所謂神聖未有過於三寶一曰佛陀, 二曰達磨, 三曰僧伽, 若燒此發願, 則必有靈應, 時王女病革, 王使胡子焚香表誓, 王女之病尋愈, 王甚喜餽贈尤厚,
高句麗로부터 傳來하니 統而言之하면 擧皆北方佛敎를 崇함이오, 隨하야 美術도 「간다라」의 美術이엇슬 것이라.
眞興王時에는
五年春二月興輪寺成, 三月許人出家爲僧尼奉佛.
佛法의 興盛을 可測할 바-어늘 又況
王幼年卽位, 一心奉佛, 至末年祝髮被僧衣, 自號法雲以終其身, 王妃亦効之爲尼, 住永興寺.
7歲의 幼少한 王으로서 一心으로 奉佛하고 末年에 至하야는 髮을 斷하며 僧衣를 被하야 僧侶의 生活을 自修함이리오, 眞實로 新羅의 佛法이 高句麗와 百濟보다 遲傳되엇스나 布敎廣通의 點에 在하야 2國을 遙勝함은 그 無綠함이 아닐진저, 當時, 晉, 梁, 隋, 唐의 文化의 影響을 多蒙하얏슬 것은 不論可想也며, 其中 求法한 多數 僧侶에 依하야 直接으로 天竺의 文物을 齎傳함이 盛行하얏도다. 有名한 西域記의 著者 玄奘三藏은 唐人이니 其時는 「간다라」地方의 佛敎가, 漸次 衰微하고 婆羅門敎의 異道가 雜居하든 時代이나, 陸往陸歸한 以上 唐의 佛敎美術도 亦是 「간다라」地方의 影響이 流布되엇슬 것이며 此 玄奘과 同伴하야 那蘭陀寺에 住하얏다든 阿離耶跋摩도 新羅人이거니와 「간다라」山茶寺에 留하던 惠輪과 西乾大覺寺에 住하던 玄覺, 玄照와 菩提寺에 居하던 惠業도 悉爲 新羅人이니 求法者의 來往으로 그의 文化를 傳歸한 者-로다, 眞興王時 俗離山 法住寺의 義信은, 天竺에 直往하야 白騾로 佛經佛像을 駄歸하얏다하니 陸路인 以上 中央亞細亞로 入하야 「간다라」의 美術品을 携來하얏슬지라, 此와 反히 天竺의 僧侶가 東來하야 法을 傳한 者도 亦 多하니 百濟律宗의 祖인 謙益과 伴來하야 律部72卷을＜20＞ 共譯한 倍達多三藏이며, 新羅 智異山 華嚴寺를 初創한 煙起三藏 等 其外에도 無數할 새 또한 代不乏人이엇도다.
文學, 美術, 音樂이 傳來하니, 建築, 繪畵, 彫刻, 鑄造 等은 勿論이오, 機織, 製革, 園藝까지도 皆是勃然히 蔚起할새 當時 이미 敵國도 亦畏하는 新羅의 三大國寶를 有한지라.
一曰, 眞興王의 皇龍寺丈六佛 (銅, 三萬五千七斤 黃金 一萬一百九十八分)
二曰, 眞平王의 玉帶 (長十圍)
三曰, 善德女王의 芬皇寺塔 (相輪, 四十二尺 塔身, 百八十三尺)
百濟와 高句麗를 滅한 後 新羅와 唐間의 交通이 漸次 斷絶됨을 隨하야 우리 半島 固有의 審美的 意匠에서 獨立한 美術作品이 建築으로 彫刻으로 種種 出來하얏도다. 神文王時에는 佛國, 栢林 等 諸寺가 興하고 哀莊王時에는 海印寺를 創하며 興德王時에는 梵魚寺가 起한지라, 兵燹이 相仍하고 荒頹가 年久하야 當代의 燦爛한 者는 難得이나 慶州 佛國寺 多寶塔, 釋迦塔은 世人의 旣稱하는 바-요. 智異山 華嚴寺, 舍利塔, 金堤 金山寺 六角多層塔 等 그 어찌 神妙를 傳하는 바가 아니리오, 其外에 彫刻으로 慶州 太宗武烈王碑, 佛國寺 石窟庵內 佛像 及 菩蕯像은 如何하며 鑄造로 平昌 上院寺와 慶州 奉德寺의 銅鍾 等 天賦인 美術的 天才가 그의 獨擅인 神意가 發하며 靈技가 動함을 隨하야는 神品傑作이 並出하니 豈可以 世界藝苑의 絶寶로서 오즉 稱揚하고 而已할 者-리오, 이미 希臘式의 傳說을 攝取하고 印度를 容하며 中國을 納하야 우리의 美術은 東洋의 眞을 本하고 希臘의 趣를 加하야 做出成來한 者-니 우리 半島의 美術은 實로 幾多의 派를 化하고 流를 合하야 生할 새 東洋美術의 精華가 是에 비롯오 發하얏도다. 此의 潑潑한 美術的 才源을 一搖하매 抵觸되는 곳마다 그의 靈韻이 活하니 어찌 半島內뿐에서 止한 바-리오. 一次 東으로 流하매 扶桑國의 四天王寺를 建하며 法隆寺를 起하얏고 彼의 美術史上 黃金時代의 造成者는 우리 倍達族이 잇슴일새로다. 佛法의 傳布로 尊崇되는 日本 聖德王子로서 高句麗 沙門慧慈의 五戒를 受하얏스며 以是로 一代間에 初創한 佛寺가 40餘를 數하게 된 것으로써 推想할지라도 不問而可知라. 扶桑美術의 標節이 되는 法隆寺 金堂壁畵가 高句麗 曇徵의 妙蹟이 아니고 무엇이며 聖德王子의 像이 百濟 阿佐의 餘墨이 아니고 무엇이리오, 尺童이라도 皆稱하는 奈良의 大佛은 그의 鑄工長인 中國連公麻呂가 百濟人의 後裔이며 平安朝 美術家의 元頭가 된 河成이 亦是 百濟人임이로다. 東南의 列島로부터 西北의 曠野를 地盤삼는 半島의 美術, 이에 東洋文華의 精英이 되니 其後 高麗時代를 通하야 今日에 至하기까지 世界美術史上 首位를 占한 美術이 또한 如斯히 非凡한 者이엇도다. =(未完)=＜21＞
