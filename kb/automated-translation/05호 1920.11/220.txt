What is poetry (詩)?

Poetry (詩) refers to verse (韻文). Its characteristics are possessing a melody (音調) suitable for singing, having a tightly structured form (形式), and being inverted compared to ordinary writing (文章). If it possesses even one of these three qualities (性質), it can be called poetry. Kasa (歌詞) and Sijo (詩調) are the traditional poetry of Korea (朝鮮); recent New Style Poetry (新體詩) imitates Western poetry (西洋詩). Chinese poetry (漢詩) is the poetry of China (支那).<94>

**Summary**

This short piece defines poetry as verse characterized by musicality, a tightly structured form, or linguistic inversion compared to standard prose. It categorizes Kasa and Sijo as traditional Korean poetic forms, identifies the emerging Sinch'esi (New Style Poetry) as an imitation of Western models, and acknowledges Hansi (Chinese poetry) as the distinct poetic tradition of China. From a historical perspective, the article is interesting for its clear classification of poetic forms prevalent or recognized in colonial Korea, drawing distinctions between native traditions, foreign influences (Western and Chinese), and the emergence of modern forms. The use of the term 支那 for China is also characteristic of the period.
