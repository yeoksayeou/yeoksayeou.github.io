One must respect one wise wife more than ten great men, for one wise wife can indeed produce ten great men.

Among the Creator's (造物主) creations, the greatest masterpiece is woman.

A woman's body weight (軆重) is the same as the weight of the love and tears she possesses.

The more one studies poetry and wives, the more one's sense of reverence increases.

Since ancient times, there has been no instance of a man achieving success (立身) without receiving the love of an excellent wife; thus, a man loved by an excellent wife is bound to succeed.

Who would look coldly upon his own wife? When your friends (親舊) depart, your parents (父母) fall asleep, and everything by your side becomes scattered, the only one there to hear your very last words will be your wife.＜88＞

**Summary**

This short piece consists of several aphorisms praising the value and importance of women, particularly wives. It argues that a wise wife is more valuable than great men because she can produce them, calls women the Creator's masterpiece, equates their weight with love and tears, compares them favorably to poetry, and asserts that a man's success depends on a good wife's love, who will remain loyal until the very end. From a historical perspective, this text is interesting as it presents a highly positive, albeit somewhat idealized and arguably traditional (in terms of linking women's value to men's success and support), view of women's role during the colonial period, potentially reflecting changing social attitudes or a specific ideological stance within the context of the *Kaebyŏk* magazine. Historians might find the elevation of the wife's role noteworthy, contrasting it with purely patriarchal norms while still framing it largely within domestic and supportive functions.

十人의 偉人보다 一人의 賢婦人을 尊重치 아니치 못할지니 一人의 賢婦人은 能히 十人의 偉人을 産出함으로써이라.
造物主의 創造品 
中 最傑作이 女子다.
女子의 軆重은 그의 가진 愛와 淚의 重量과 同하니라.
詩와 婦人은 硏究할사록 尊敬의 念이 增한다.
예적부터 훌륭한 婦人에게 사랑을 밧지 아니한 人으로 立身한 例가 無하니 훌륭한 婦人으로부터 사랑하는 사람은 必히 成功하는 法이다.
누가 自己의 婦人을 冷視할 者이냐? 너의 親舊가 가고 父母가 잠들고 모든 것이 너의 겻을 支離하다할 時에 너의 最後의 가는 말을 들을 者는 오즉 너의 婦人이 有할 뿐이라.＜88＞
