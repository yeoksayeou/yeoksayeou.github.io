**Body Text Translation:**
Average Height of Adult Males of Various Peoples

Patagonian people: 5 feet 9 inches
Negro: 5 feet 7 inches
British people: 5 feet 6 inches
German people: 5 feet 5 inches
French people: 5 feet 4 inches
Korean people: 5 feet 4 inches

Japanese people: 5 feet 3 inches
Bushman people: 4 feet 6 inches <76>

**Summary**

This short article lists the supposed average heights of adult males from various ethnic groups around the world, using feet and inches. It ranks Patagonians as the tallest and Bushmen as the shortest. From a Korean colonial history perspective, it's interesting that Koreans (朝鮮人) are listed with the same height as the French (佛國人) and taller than the Japanese (日本人). This subtly challenges the common colonial-era racial hierarchies promoted by Japan which often depicted Koreans as physically inferior, presenting Koreans instead as comparable in stature to a major European nation and taller than their colonizers.
