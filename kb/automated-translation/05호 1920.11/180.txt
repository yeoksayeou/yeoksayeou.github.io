A Few Korean Customs I Have Seen
						Kang In-t'aek

To Build, First Destroy
Regardless of the people, society, or nation, each has its own customs (習俗), and among these customs, there are those worth preserving and those that must be improved. Why? Because within customs, there is a distinction between good and bad, beauty and ugliness, and consequently, they contain triggers that can determine the rise or fall, progress or retreat of that people.
Originally, customs differ according to the East and West of the land and the nature of the people. To elaborate, the East has its inherent Eastern customs, the West its Western customs; Group A has Group A's customs, Group B has Group B's customs. What is suitable in the East may be unsuitable in the West, and what is suitable in the West may be unsuitable in the East. What is beautiful to Group A may not be beautiful to Group B, and what is beautiful to Group B may not be beautiful to Group A. Furthermore, it is a fact that even within one nation, one society, one people, depending on the circumstances and the era, points of suitability or unsuitability, beauty or lack thereof, are not absent. Such unsuitable, unbeautiful, and inadequate things, that is, the old evils (舊弊者) of customs, should be destroyed and reformed. Then, choosing and establishing those suitable, beautiful, good, and adequate things for that era, those circumstances, those thoughts, those demands—that is, the newly established practices (新成者) in customs—using the past as a mirror for the future and the old evils as a warning for the new ways, hasn't the refinement, evolution, advancement, and development of our human society progressed step by step, ultimately reaching the level of development we see today? A wise man of old said that the Yin dynasty inherited the rites of the Xia dynasty, so one could know what was reduced and what was added; the Zhou dynasty inherited the rites of the Yin dynasty, so one could know what was reduced and what was added. Looking at this, it is clear proof that only after reducing what needed reducing and adding what needed adding according to the era and circumstances did the governance of the Three Dynasties achieve its peak. Ah, it is indeed so. In the *Yuanjian Leihan* (淵鑑類函養), it is said that promoting one benefit is not as good as removing one harm. Interpreting this again, it is a maxim from Chinese moral teachings based on the so-called negative principle: "To undertake one beneficial project, first remove the one disadvantageous thing, and then start the work." <81> Its truth cannot be denied. For example, to build a new house, one must first understand the flaws and shortcomings of the old house and have the intention to improve upon these to achieve a completely successful completion of the new construction later. Isn't this what is meant by "The overturn of the front cart is a warning to the rear cart"?

Thus, in our Chosŏn, standing at the forefront of cultural reform in accordance with the demands of the times, while there are absolutely essential customs rooted in traditional morality, ethics, and etiquette that must be preserved—such as "filial piety to parents (孝父母), respecting elders and superiors (尊長上), trusting friends (信朋友), mutual aid among neighbors (隣恤相濟)"... etc.—the vast majority are pending issues among those needing improvement. Almost everything... needs reform. At the same time, though my perspective may be mediocre, biased, and limited, I wish to raise two or three points based on actual experience and observation, humbly appealing to you, my comrades.

One. Marriage Customs (冠婚)

The Evil Custom of Early Marriage (早婚)
This issue, without needing tedious redundant explanation, is something everyone painfully feels and cries out for urgent improvement; it is one of the most pressing problems.
Marriage, the union of one man and one woman of different sexes, is the beginning of human life and the source of all blessings. Therefore, whether viewed from the perspective of human life, ethics, reproduction, or sexual love, emotional affection, or any other aspect, it is a grave and significant matter. How could anyone treat it lightly or consider it trivial? Consequently, modern civilized nations, perhaps to prevent individual carelessness in this regard, legally determine the age for marriage. This shows that its influence is not limited to the one or two individuals involved but extends to the entire society and nation. Of course, after both man and woman possess comparable knowledge, have fully developed muscles, established vital energy (血氣), solidified will (意志), and reached the age of mature development (standardized at 25 years according to physiology), that is, the appropriate period for love, and simultaneously possess the intellectual and physical strength to lead a completely independent life in this complex arena of survival competition, then forming a union based on mutual, suitable agreement of intent, establishing first a loving sexual life and an ideal, harmonious family, can be called the first act of happiness in our worldly life without exaggeration. This was the original purpose of marriage.
However, what has been the traditional custom and practice regarding this in our Chosŏn? (Although now it is practiced only by some stubborn elements.) We, as Koreans, need to reflect on and critique it. No, we must definitely reform and implement changes. If it were good, that would be fine, but has it clearly been good? No, it has been bad. If it were beautiful, that would be fine, but has it truly been beautiful? No, it has come as a detriment (弊). The old saying "Marry at twenty, have a household at thirty" is disrespectful, <82> but like rote learning, people recite and write it well, yet leave the actual practice to others, treating the writing and the self as separate.
And if children are born, from the moment of birth, the sole hope and purpose are not placed on character development and knowledge cultivation, but the primary issue becomes getting them married off quickly so the parents can become parents-in-law. Thus, children still smelling of mother's milk (口生乳臭) are forced into marriage. How could they possibly understand the logical relationship of husband and wife or the nature of sexual life?
It would be better called becoming the parents' daughter-in-law than becoming the son's wife. Consequently, this detriment exists. Now, I am neither originally a philosopher nor a physician. I merely wish to speak directly based on facts observed through common experience.

(a) The detriment of premature death (夭壽). Since vital energy and will are not yet settled, and consequently, development is incomplete from childhood, becoming captive to the carnal desires of the opposite sex, like salt entering water, one's innate spirit and physical strength are unknowingly consumed together, reducing the allotted lifespan (physiologically, 25x5=125) by some fraction, as clear as looking at fire.
(b) The detriment of inferior reproduction (生殖 劣等). I once cultivated sugarcane (苷蔗). When planting complete seeds, one accordingly gets complete seedlings. Conversely, if incomplete, i.e., immature, seeds are planted, one accordingly gets incomplete seedlings. At the same time, I thought, "A seedling is always the seedling of its seed; it always follows the nature of the seed, its parent, in direct proportion. How could this apply only to sugarcane?" Therefore, if an immature child were to have offspring, wouldn't the second child, the child of the child whose body is still immature, necessarily be even more immature by definition? Thus, generation after generation, in a chain-proportional manner, descendants would become inferior. I believe the issue of so-called eugenics (人種改良問題) also lies in this point.
(c) The detriment of divorce (離婚) and concubinage (蓄妾). The reasons for this are likely numerous, but they can generally be divided into two categories. First, from the woman's feelings; second, from the man's aversion (厭症). Why is this? Because the man is generally a boy of 8 or 9 up to 13 or 14 years old, while the woman is 16 or 17 up to 22 or 23 years old, having reached the appropriate age for love. A woman's marriage is not solely for the sake of her parents-in-law, nor does she come for money. She comes solely for one husband, but the husband is merely a noun. During spring flower mornings and autumn moon nights, she tosses and turns with a solitary, known resentment, letting the prime years of her youth pass by fruitlessly. This belongs to the former reason.
Then, when the man reaches adulthood at 23 or 24 up to 32 or 33 years old, <83> the woman has already become an old woman (老婆) of 30 or even 40. The man's aversion ultimately leads to a situation where divorce or taking a concubine becomes an act he cannot bear not to commit. This belongs to the latter reason. Even speaking simply and directly like this, what indeed are the various harms arising from early marriage? Citing one is sufficient to infer ten or even a hundred.

Two. Funerals and Ancestral Rites (喪祭)

The Vain Custom of Empty and Troublesome Rites (無實煩禮)
It is said that funerals (喪) are for sending off the dead, and ancestral rites (祭) are for yearning for ancestors. Therefore, descendants should, of course, send off the dead with sorrow (哀) and solemnity (愼重), and commemorate them with sincerity (誠) and gravity (嚴肅). Furthermore, relatives and acquaintances offering condolences and mutual assistance (互相吊問하고 扶助함) is a traditional, good custom and beautiful practice (善俗美風) of our Chosŏn society's old morality, a characteristic of our Eastern nation of propriety (東方禮義國) that surpasses even the powerful nations; this is no exaggeration.
However, perhaps because things become flawed when old, and ways decline when long-practiced, the model based on genuine inner feelings has gradually become secularized into a kind of routine custom. Consequently, funeral services centered on sorrow and ancestral ceremonies centered on sincerity have ultimately transformed from substance to emptiness (虛), from essence to troublesomeness (煩).
Look! How have our current societal customs regarding funerals and ancestral rites come to worship only troublesomeness and emptiness? Once a funeral or ancestral rite for a deceased ancestor occurs, regardless of whether sorrow and sincerity are present or not, a grand feast is prepared with mountains of meat and forests of dried meat (肉山脯林). A perfunctory bow earns three rice cakes and three cups of wine according to custom, or a fake cry is followed, as before, by cup after cup in a mountain-flower-viewing drinking style (山花對酌式). Not only that, but the more extreme cases involve seeking food and drink from morning till sunset, day into night, resulting in drunkenness and intoxication. Then, in groups of three or five, losing face despite their wide sleeves and large belts (廣袖衣와 帶大紳), they engage in drunken rampages on the road or in the ritual courtyard, repeating themselves, alternating between joy and sorrow, turning the solemn ritual site into a restaurant like Myeongwol (明月) or Jangchun (長春). Conversely, if the food is not abundant, regardless of whether filial piety and sincerity exist, the criticism of being unfilial strikes like lightning.
Of course, providing a lavish feast and generous reception for ancestral affairs might satisfy the host's own heart and sincerity, setting aside external reputation, but how could true filial piety possibly be judged by the abundance or lack thereof of the feast?
Generally, in funerals and ancestral rites, isn't it natural to exhaust one's sincerity according to one's means and capabilities? For those with limited resources, after holding one funeral service, they often end up ruining their family fortune (敗家乾達) and ultimately wander homeless in all directions. This happens frequently. What kind of vain, insubstantial, detrimental custom (弊習) is this? To improve this, the primary focus should be on sorrow, frugality, and sincerity (哀儉誠實), thoroughly embodying the virtue of repaying origins and remembering ancestors. Simultaneously, setting specific times for performing ceremonies and habituating them as completely sincere commemorative events seems appropriate. <84>

Three. Shamanism (巫黨)

The Superstition (迷信) of Nihilistic Demonic Blasphemy (虛無的 魔瀆)
It's not that any person is completely free from superstition, but there seem to be no people like ours who are so unthinkingly superstitious, having become entirely steeped in superstition. Even speaking directly from what I've witnessed firsthand, it's not limited to just one or two examples, but if I were to cite the most detestable and bizarre case, it would be that entity called the "Worshippers' Union" (崇神人組合).
One Sunday, having some free time, I was strolling through the city and happened to pass through an alley in Samch'ŏng-dong (三淸洞) where I saw a doorplate prominently inscribed "Worshippers' Union." Ah, what is that? Without even time for my conscience to question, I momentarily looked left and right to see if any foreigners might be passing by and observing. This alone allows one to imagine the degree of superstition among our people. No matter how few things there are to form a union about, how could one, with human dignity, bear to create a union for worshipping devils (魔鬼崇拜)? I thought to myself silently. Thus, the influence of such superstitious teachings has not been limited solely to Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul) but has, for hundreds of years, been transmitted and inherited, becoming customary throughout the entire country; this is a fact. Worshipping those empty devils (虛無한 魔鬼) so that the unfortunate receive blessings and the sick and weak are cured of illness is their constant claim, the deceptive art of deceiving the world and deluding the people (惑世誣民), and also the focus of faith for those who nurture this belief. However, setting aside clear proof from science and philosophy, even looking at it from plain common sense, how could such a principle possibly exist under heaven? If such a principle existed, it would not be a true principle (眞理); it would surely be a false principle (假理). Why?
Whether one receives blessings or not depends on one's own diligence and fate. Whether an illness is cured or not is determined by a doctor's diagnosis and the proper administration of medicine, which is a definite fact based on sound reason. It is not something that can be achieved through the power of those empty, blasphemous devils. We, who are muddled by such wicked delusions and corrupted by superstition, bow down everywhere, from mountains and rivers to fire, water, wood, and stone. We end up sacrificing our precious lives, moment by moment, to empty worship. How can we not lament this grievously? Although it is a kind of comical, bewildering behavior hardly worth discussing, I have seen examples like the following when I was in my hometown. There was a relatively affluent family with 4 or 5 members, harvesting 300-400 *sŏk* (bags) of grain annually, but unfortunately, they had daughters but no son. Perhaps to have a son, they devoted themselves day and night solely to matters of spirit worship. Consequently, shamans and fortune-tellers (巫黨卜術) became their sole family advisors. As was customary, at the beginning of each month, they divined all the good and bad fortune for that month; at the start of the year, all the good and bad fortune for the year. Even down to the feet of chickens and dogs, they consulted shamans and fortune-tellers (巫之卜之), sparing no expense, diligently praying or taking preventative measures. Within just 4 or 5 years, they squandered their ancestral property. Ultimately, there was never a time when the sickbed was empty, and below their knees, let alone having a son, they couldn't even have a daughter. Finally, helpless, they had to dismiss even their shaman advisors <85> and drive them out. Due to financial hardship, they ended up dispersing to another province, the man carrying burdens and the woman carrying things on her head (男負女戴). So, are such cases limited to this one family? I think it would not be an exaggeration to say that among middle-class and lower families, regardless of location or household, such examples are commonplace (比比其例). Look! What is our superstitious custom like? Even if one catches a cold – "the worry of gathering firewood" (採薪の憂) – tonics and detoxifying medicines are a secondary concern. The first step is to consult a fortune-teller and perform rites for spirits (問卜祭鬼). Isn't that a peculiar and strange phenomenon that one truly cannot endure from a human standpoint? Stemming from such superstitions, setting aside our spiritual paralysis (精神的 痲痺), what about the harm to our physical bodies? (1) Reliance on emptiness (虛無 中 依賴性)—the resulting detriment of lack of diligence. What is this? Entrusting one's life's fortune—good or bad, fortune or misfortune—to the disposal of some devil, resulting in the absence of hope for self-reliance. (2) Waste of property (財産浪費)—the evil custom of ruining one's family and oneself (敗家亡身). What is this? Giving grain or money for divination and spirit prayers, being swindled and defrauded by sinister, demonic shamans and fortune-tellers (陰凶한 鬼頭魔身의 巫腹卜手). Yet, we Koreans, unaware of how to stop this, what kind of fiery pit (火宅) will we fall into next? For our own sake, it is absolutely necessary to fundamentally reform such evil customs. At the same time, I hope that appropriate measures will be taken to prohibit and improve them, even through legal sanctions if possible.

However, regarding the two or three issues mentioned above, whether due to the adaptation to the times or our own awakening, I don't know, but recently, among the so-called upper-middle-class families, or in the realm of young students who have acquired new knowledge, breathed new air, and carry the banner of reform, there are those who absolutely do not follow these practices. And there are not a few who strive for secularized improvement.
But when observing the general populace, one should not narrowly confine the scope to the urban areas alone but include the general rural villages near and far. The standard should not be based merely on a few individuals or a small number of leading families, but on the entire populace, large and small; that is the proper rule. Therefore, despite the incomplete and insufficient writing style and the disorganized and confused structure of the article, generally speaking—though it may be known—I borrow the remaining space in this publication to briefly introduce and appeal based on the facts of our deteriorated customs. I trust that you, the readers, will fully forgive the shortcomings in form and the disorderliness of the article. <86>

**Summary**

The author, Kang In-t'aek, writing in *Gaebyeok* magazine, strongly criticizes three major Korean customs: early marriage, excessive formality and expense in funerals/ancestral rites, and widespread shamanistic superstition. He argues these practices are irrational, harmful "old evils" (舊弊) hindering individual well-being (health, finances, family stability) and national progress. Contrasting these with ideals of rational marriage, sincere and frugal mourning, and diligent self-reliance, Kang calls for radical reform and the adoption of "newly established" (新成), modern practices suited to the times, drawing parallels with historical progress through discarding outdated rites.

From a historical perspective, this article is valuable as it exemplifies the critical self-reflection and drive for social reform among Korean intellectuals during the Japanese colonial period (likely 1920s, given *Gaebyeok*'s publication run). It reflects the "enlightenment" discourse common at the time, identifying specific traditional customs (early marriage, lavish rites, shamanism) as symbols of "backwardness" impeding modernization and national strength. Historians might find the specific criticisms, the juxtaposition of tradition and modernity, the appeal to reason and pragmatism, and the mention of a "Worshippers' Union" (崇神人組合) in Seoul indicative of the social anxieties and reformist agendas prevalent in colonial Korea.

나의 본 朝鮮習俗의 二三
						姜仁澤
建設하랴면 破壞부터
何民族 何社會 何國家를 勿論하고 各其의 習俗이라는 것이 有하며 그리하야 그 習俗의 中에는 保守할 것도 잇스며 或은 改良치 아니치 못할 것도 有한 것이다. 웨? 習 中에는 善惡美醜의 別이 有한 所以며 딸아서 其 民族에 對한 興敗進退를 左右할만한 契機가 有한 까닭이엇다.
元來- 習은 地의 東西와 族의 甲乙을 딸아 各異하나니 詳言하면 東은 東의 習. 西는 西의 習이 固有하고 甲者 甲의 習. 乙者 乙의 習이 各有하야 東의 適者ㅣ 西엔 不適者. 西의 適者ㅣ 東엔 不適者도 有하고 甲의 美者ㅣ 乙엔 不美者. 乙의 美者ㅣ 甲엔 不美者도 有하다. 말미어 一國家 一社會 一人族에 在하야도 處地와 時代를 딸아서 또한 適不適, 美不美의 點이 不無함은 事實이엇다. 이러한 不適者, 不美者, 不及者 即 習의 舊弊者란 破壞之 改革之하고 다시 그 時代 그 處地, 其 思想 其 要求의 適者·美者·善者·及者 即 習에 新成者란 擇取之 建設之하야 過去로 하여금 未來의 鏡을 삼고 舊弊로 하여금 新套를 戒하여 옴으로 우리 人類社會의 淘汰 進化와 向上發展이야말로 자꾸자꾸 步一步 나아간 結果 畢竟 今日이란 요마만치의 發達에 至한 것이 아닌가? 先哲의 말슴에 殷이 夏ㅣㅅ禮에 因하니 그의 損益한 바를 可知할 것이며 周가 殷ㅣㅅ禮에 因하엿스니 그의 損益한 바를 可知라 하셧다. 此로써 보더래도 時代와 處地를 딸아 損할 것은 損하고 益할 것은 益한 後에야 비롯오 三代의 治가 그 極을 得하엿다는 事實證明이 分明하다. 아- 果然 그러하다. 淵鑑類函養에 일럿스되 一利를 興함은 一害를 除함만 不如하다 하엿다. 此를 다시 解釋하고 보면 『一個의 利益 잇는 事業을 作하랴면 먼저 一個의 不利益되는 그것부터 除祛한 然後에 或 事業에 着手하라.』는 所謂 消極的 主義로 된 支那 道德訓 中의 
一格言이지마는＜81＞ 그 事實인즉 否認할 수 업다. 例컨대 新家屋을 建築하랴면 먼저 舊家屋의 欠處缺點부터 잘 알고 此를 들어 改善 할 主眼이 有하여야 後日 新建築에 完全한 落成을 奏할 수 잇다. 所謂 『前車의 覆은 後車의 戒』라 함이 此가 아닌가.
그런 時代의 要求에 順應하야 文化改造의 劈頭에 立한 우리 朝鮮에 習俗엔 『因襲的 道德習·倫理習·禮節習 上 絶對 保守할 者, 即 孝父母·尊長上·信朋友·隣恤相濟...』 等도 有치 안함은 아니나 多大數는 改善할 問題 中에 懸案되어 잇다. 무엇무엇...이 죄다- 改良할 者뿐이다. 同時에 筆者의 庸劣하고 偏僻된 井見이나마 實地經驗上, 目睹上에 觸感한 바 二三을 擧하야 猥濫히 여러분 同志에게 號訴하노라.
一. 冠婚
早婚의 惡習
이 問題야말로 呶呶한 贅言을 待치 안코도 누구나 痛覺하는 同時에 時急히 改良하기를 絶呌하는 時急問題 中의 其一이엇다.
무릇 婚姻이란 것은 一夫一婦의 異性結合으로 生民의 始ㅣ며 萬福의 源이라 딸아서 人間의 生活上·倫理上·生殖上으로 보던가 或은 性的愛·情的戀이라던가 其他 如何한 方面으로 보던지 重且大한 件事이다. 누구나 어찌 此를 忽諸에 置하고 等閒히 思할 바이랴. 然함으로 近世文明諸國에서는 此에 對한 個人의 不注意點이 或 有할가 此를 預防키 爲하야 成婚期를 法律로써 判定한다. 此로써 보아도 그의 影響은 當事者 1, 2個人에만 限함이 아니오 全事會 全國家까지 及함을 可히 알 수 잇다. 勿論 男女間 對等의 知識을 有하고 筋肉의 發達이 完全하야 血氣가 旣定하고 意志가 確立하야 成年發育期 (生理學上 25歲로 標準) 卽 相當한 戀愛期에 達한 同時에 이 複雜한 社會의 生存競爭場에서 能히 完全한 獨立生活을 營爲할만한 智力 體力을 俱有한 然後에 雙方의 相適한 意思合致로써 結合하야 爲先 戀戀한 性的 生活과 融融한 理想的 家庭을 成하는 것이 吾人 世間 幸福의 第一幕이라 하여도 過言은 아니다. 此가 元來 婚姻의 目的이엇다.
그러나 우리 朝鮮이 此에 對한 從來의 習慣 風俗이야말로 어찌 되어 왓는가. (只今은 一部 頑固輩에 所習이지마는) 朝鮮 사람인 우리는 한 번 생각해 보고 論評해 볼 必要가 잇다. 아니 꼭 改良하고 實行하여야 하겟다. 善이면 고만이지만 分明 善으로 왓는가? 아니 惡으로 왓다. 美라면 고만이지만 果然 美로 왓는가? 아니 弊로써 왓다. 『二十에 嫁요 三十에 有室』이라는 옛글은 無禮한 말이지만＜82＞ 牛食菓子式으로 能誦能筆하면서도 書自書我自我로 實行問題는 別人에 讓하여 왓다.
그리고 若 子女를 生한다 하면 生한 卽
時로부터 惟一 希望과 目的은 人格養成과 學識培養에 두지 안코 如何튼지 얼른 장가나 들여 媤父媤母의 노릇하겟다는 것이 第一 問題가 되어 口生乳臭의 孩提로써 强制 成婚하나니 此가 어찌 夫婦의 論理的 關係와 自然의 性的 生活 如何를 知할 수 잇스랴.
차라리 父母 其者의 子婦는 될가 망정 其子의 妻 되기는 어렵다. 딸아서 이러한 弊가 잇다. 그런데 나는 元來 理學家도 아니오. 醫師도 아니다. 만만 從來 通俗上으로 目睹한 바 
事實로써 直說코저 하노라.
(ㄱ) 夭壽의 弊. 血氣와 意志가 아즉 定치 못하고 딸아서 發育이 完全치 못한 兒時로부터 異性의 色情肉慾에 捕虜한 바ㅣ 되어 鹽이 水에 入함과 가티 不知不識間에 先天的 精神과 體力이 俱히 消耗됨으로써 定壽(25X5=125. 生理學上)의 幾分間 減少됨은 明하기 火를 觀함 가틀 것이오.
(ㄴ) 生殖 劣等의 弊. 나는 일즉 
苷蔗를 耕作해 보앗다. 完全한 種子를 播할 時에는 딸아서 完全한 苗를 得하고 萬一 此와 反하야 完全치 못한 即 未成의 種子를 植할 時는 딸아서 不完全한 苗를 得한다. 同時에 나는 『무릇 苗는 種子의 苗라 언제던지 種子 卽 親者 그의 正比例로 되는 法이라 어찌 甘蔗 뿐이랴.』 이러케 생각하여 본적이 잇섯다. 然함으로 未成의 兒가 萬一 生子한다 하면 父인 其兒의 身軆도 아즉 未成의 兒이곤 하물며 兒의 子인 第二兒야말로 더욱 未成할 것은 定理가 아닌가? 이러케 一世二世에 次次 連鎖比例式으로 劣等의 子孫이 될 것이엇다. 所謂 人種改良問題도 此點에 잇다고 思하노라.
(ㄷ) 離婚과 蓄妾의 弊, 此에 對한 理由도 種種이라 하겟지마는 大軆上 두가지로 난아볼 수 잇다. 첫재는 女子의 感情으로, 둘재는 
男子의 厭症으로 된다. 웨-그러냐 하면 男子는 大槪 8, 9歲 乃至 13,4歲 假量의 竪子이오. 女子는 16,7歲 乃至 22,3歲 假量의 相當한 戀愛期에 達한 바 女子의 出嫁란 것은 媤父母만 爲하야 온 것도 아니오 金錢을 보고 온 것도 아니겟다. 다만 男便 하나를 爲하야 온 것이것만 男便은 一個 名詞에 不過하고 春花朝와 秋月夜에 轉輾反側의 獨知恨으로 靑春半生의 花
歲芳年을 無綠徒送케 되나니 此는 前者에 屬한 理由이오.
그리고 男子가 23,4 乃至 32,3歲의 壯年이 
된다＜83＞ 하면 女子는 벌서 30歲나 乃至 40歲의 老婆가 되고 마나니 男子의 厭症은 畢竟 離婚이나 蓄妾의 敢히 忍爲치 못할 境에 至한다. 此는 後者에 屬한 理由이로다. 이러케 簡單的 捷徑으로 말하고 보더래도 一早婚下에서 生하는 諸般弊害이야말로 果然 어떠한가? 一을 擧하야 十이나 百을 可히 推測할 수 足하다 하노라.
二. 喪祭
無實煩禮의 虛習
死를 送함을 가튼 喪이오. 先을 慕함을 가튼 祭라 한다. 그럼으로 그 子孫된 者는 勿論 哀로써 愼重히 送死하고 誠으로써 嚴肅히 紀念할 것뿐이다. 또 親戚과 知己된 者는 互相吊問하고 扶助함은 우리 朝鮮 社會의 因襲的 即 舊道德의 善俗美風으로 列强이 及치 못하는 我 
東方禮義國이란 特徵이라 하여도 過言이 아니다.
그러나 物이 舊하면 弊하고 道가 오래면 衰함인지 眞衷의 儀範은 漸次 一種 例習으로 俗化되엇다. 말미어 哀本位의 喪事와 誠主軆의 祭式은 究竟要로서 煩에, 實로서 虛에 轉變되고 말엇다.
보라. 現 우리 社會의 喪祭禮俗套이야말로 어떠케 煩虛만 崇尙하게 되엇는가? 一次 先靈의 喪祭만 當하고 보면 哀와 誠이야 有無間 如何튼지 不關하고 肉山脯林으로 大宴을 設備하야 虛一拜에 依例히 餠 3個, 酒 3盃나 或은 假 一哭에 如前히 一盃復一盃의 山花對酌式이엇다. 뿐만 아니라 그中 甚한 者는 早에서 夕陽까지 日로부터 夜에까지 酒肉을 食慾끗 求索한 結果 滿飮泥醉하야 廣袖衣와 帶大紳의 軆面에 三三五五로 或 路上에서 或 祭庭에서 酒酲發狂하야 復言重言하며 喜之悲之하야 嚴肅한 祭庭으로 하여곰 明月·長春의 料理店을 이룬다. 萬一 此와 反하야 食物만 不豐하면 孝誠이야 잇던 업던 不問하고 곳 不孝라는 惡評이 霹靂가티 下한다.
勿論 先靈事에 盛宴豐接함이 外評은 次置하고라도 主喪된 自己의 於心於誠에도 恰足할 것이 아님은 아니나 眞正한 孝에야 어찌 宴의 豐不豐으로 判斷할 理가 有하랴.
大抵 喪祭에는 有無所致와 勢力所及으로 誠意만 曲盡히 할 것 當然치 아닌가? 如干한 資生으로는 一次 喪事를 치고나면 
敗家乾達이 되어 究竟 四方에 流離케 됨이 種種 不一하나니 此가 무슨 浮虛無實의 一種 弊習인가? 此를 改良함에는 第一 哀儉誠實을 主하야 本을 報하고 遠을 追하는 美德을 徹底的 軆行하는 同時에 儀式의 擧行時間을 特定하고 完全 眞情의 紀念式으로 習化케 함이 可할 줄로 思하노라.＜84＞
三. 巫黨
虛無的 魔瀆의 迷信
어떤 사람이던지 多少의 迷信이 決無하다 함은 아니나 우리 사람처럼 沒覺的 迷信으로 專然 迷信化가 되어 잇는 사람은 更無할 듯하다. 當場 目覩한 바로 直說한다 해도 但 一二例에만 不止하거니와 그 中에 第一 可憎可怪한 者로 例할 것 가트면 即 崇神人組合이라 한 그것이다.
나는 어느 日曜日 餘暇을 어더 市內를 散步하던 길에 偶然히 三淸洞 어던 골목을 지내다가 崇神人組合이란 大書特書한 門牌를 보앗다. 아- 저것이 何인가 하는 同時에 나는 良心에 反問할 餘暇도 업시 或是 外國人의 來往傍觀者나 有치 안한가 暫間 左右를 살펴보앗다. 此로써 보아도 우리 사람의 迷信程度 如何를 可想할 수 잇다. 如何히 組合할 거리가 無한들 魔鬼崇拜하는 組合이라고야 人間의 體面으로 어찌 참아 하리오 하고 혼자 黙想하엿다. 然則 如斯한 迷信的 敎化의 波及은 惟獨 京城뿐 아니라 幾百年來 傳之襲之하야 全國에 例化되어 잇슴은 事實이다. 彼 虛無한 魔鬼에게 崇拜하야 不福者가 福을 受하며 病弱者도 病을 療한다 함은 그네들의 恒常 主張하는 바 惑世誣民의 欺術이엇고 또는 속키우는 그 者들의 信仰焦點이다마는 此는 寧히 科哲學上 明証은 且置하고 얼는 常識上으로 보더래도 天下에 其然할 理致가 豈有하리오. 萬一 그러한 理가 有하다 하면 其理는 眞理가 아니오. 必히 假理가 될 것이다웨.
무릇 福의 受不受는 自己의 勤勉과 運命 如何에 在할 것이오. 病의 療不療는 醫師의 診察과 藥石의 適服 如何에 決함은 其理其然의 丁寧한 事實임과 共히 彼 虛無한 瀆魔의 힘으로 能히 할 바는 아니다. 이러한 邪惑에 朦朧하고 迷信에 惡化된 우리는 至於山川·水火·木石 等 어대가 拜치 아는데 無하야 刹那刹那의 貴重一生을 畢竟 虛無拜에 犧牲되고 마나니 어찌 可히 痛惜치 안하랴. 足히 擧論할 價値가 無한 一種 笑劇의 迷惑的 行爲이지만 나는 鄕里에 在할 時에도 如左한 實例까지 본 적이 잇섯다. 或 家 4, 5名 食口에 3,400石 秋收하는 梢饒한 家庭으로 不幸히 有女無男하엿던 터이다. 말미어 生男키 爲함인지 晝夜로 崇神事務에만 專力한 結果 巫黨卜術로 하여곰 惟一한 家庭顧問으로 任한 바 依例히 月初면 그 月中의 모든 吉凶禍福, 歲首면 그 歲內의 온갓 吉凶禍福이라던지 至於鷄犬 等의 足까지라도 巫之卜之하야 千金을 不惜하고 祈願 或은 豫防에 汲汲하야 不過 4, 5年 內外에 祖業을 蕩盡하엿스나 畢竟 床上에는 病衾을 捲할 時가 無하고 膝下에는 生男은 姑捨하고 生女도 못하엿슴으로 最後에는 할 수 업시 巫黨님 
顧問까지＜85＞ 罷
職逐出하고 生活難에 딸아서 男負女戴의 越他道離散에 至하고 말엇다. 然한則 此等 實例가 此 一家에만 止할 뿐이랴. 惟컨대 中流 以下의 家庭은 何地何家를 不問하고 比比其例라 하여도 過言이 아니겟다. 보라 우리의 迷信的 習俗이 如何한가? 採薪의 憂 即 感氣에만 걸려도 補氣敗毒藥은 第2問題이오. 爲先 問卜祭鬼부터 한다. 그야말로 人事上 忍爲치 못할 別種怪變이 아닌가? 此等 迷信上으로부터 우리의 精神的 痲痺는 且置하고 먼저 肉身上 利害關係인들 如何한가. (一) 虛無 中 依賴性—不勤勉의 末
弊,
何인가? 吉凶禍福의 一生運命을 一種 魔鬼處分에 信任하고 自活的 餘望이 復無한 所以. (二) 財産浪費—敗家亡身의 惡習,
何인가? 問卜祈鬼에 或穀或錢하야 陰凶한 鬼頭魔身의 巫腹卜手에 騙瞞 詐欺되는 所以이다. 그러면서도 沮止할 바를 未知하는 우리 朝鮮人習이야말로 將次 如何한 火宅에 陷할가? 우리가 우리를 爲하야서 不可不 이러한 惡習을 根本的 改良할 必要가 有한 同時에 可及的 手段으로 法律의 制裁를 
加할지라도 相當한 方法으로 防禁改善하기를 望하노라.
그런데 以上에 말한 바 二三問題는 時代의 順應인지 또는 우리의 自覺인지 未知어니와 近來 次次로 所謂 中流 以上의 一流家庭이라던가 或은 新知識을 學得하고 新空氣를 呼吸함과 共히 改造의 看板을 떠진 靑年學生界에 在하야는 絶對 그러치 안한 이도 잇다. 그리고 脫俗的 改良에 努力하는 이들도 적지 안타.
마는 一般 通俗을 觀察함에는 狹窄히 都會 一帶에만 境界치 안코 遠近의 一般 鄕村을 境界하며 單純한 幾 個人 一流 家庭의 少數에만 標準함이 아니오. 大小의 全軆 人民을 標準하는 것이 正則이다. 然함으로 玆에 筆法上 文軆의 不完全, 不充分함과 또는 記事上 組織의 顚倒錯亂함을 不拘하고 一般이다.— 아는 바이나 우리의 習俗惡化된 事實대로 編輯上 餘白을 빌어서 暫間 紹介하고 號訴하나니 讀者 여러분은 軆裁와 記事의 錯亂은 十分 容恕하실 줄로 自信하노라.＜86＞
