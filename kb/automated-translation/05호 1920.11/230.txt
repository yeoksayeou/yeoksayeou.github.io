Article Title:	빠이론 詩集, 離別의 1節 (From Byron's Poetry Collection, A Verse of Parting)
Author:	Byron (via title attribution)
Article Type:	시 (Poem)

Ah, a rainy dawn, a windy night.
When joyful and when sad,
I, who hold an agonizing love (煩悶의 戀愛) that doesn't go as wished,
Cannot help but taste the pain (苦痛) of silence (沈默).
Because of the beloved. <94>

**Summary**

This short poem, presented as a verse from Byron, expresses the speaker's deep sorrow and frustration stemming from an unfulfilled or difficult love. The pain is intensified by silence, felt during atmospheric moments like rainy dawns and windy nights, and is directly attributed to the "beloved." For historians, the article is interesting as it shows the translation and reception of Western Romantic poetry (Byron) in colonial Korea, reflecting cultural exchange. The focus on personal, melancholic emotion provides insight into modes of expression beyond overtly political or nationalist themes during that era.

빠이론 詩集, 離別의 1節
아아 비 오는 새벽 바람 부는 밤.
길거울 때와 슯흘 때
뜻대로 안 되는 煩悶의 戀愛를 품은 나는,
沈默의 苦痛을 맛보지 안할 수 업다.
임으로 하여.＜94＞
