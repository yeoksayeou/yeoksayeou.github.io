Current Children's Songs in Seoul City

Oh gather 'round, help gather 'round, Jiljillebi, come bow down.
Jjia jjia satujjia, receive it with one hand.
Receive it with two hands, that wretched girl, that wretched girl, died so well.
Died so well on salted rice.
Older brother, older brother, cousin brother.
Tomorrow is the day to die, today is the day to live.
Older brother, older brother, cousin brother, cut and bring three *ja* of silk,
Wipe away the tears and snot.
Father, mother, mother, father,
If we siblings die,
Do not bury us on the front hill,
Do not bury us on the back hill, go over ridge after ridge,
Please bury us in the eggplant field. If a pair of eggplants grows,
Do not taste them, do not pick them,
Please make an offering at the royal palace. Could it be worse than marriage?

Girls aged 13 or 14 and younger in Seoul City enjoy singing the song above whenever several of them gather. The melody is extremely dreary. While there are points whose meaning is unclear, it is, in any case, a mutual lament about the bitterness of married life. <94>

**Summary**

This article presents a children's song reportedly popular among young girls (under 14) in colonial Seoul, as observed in *Kaebyŏk* magazine. The song's lyrics are quite dark, mentioning death, burial requests (specifically in an eggplant field), and offerings to the palace, concluding with the rhetorical question of whether anything could be worse than married life. The accompanying text notes the song's melancholy tune and explicitly interprets it as the girls' collective lament expressing the anticipated hardships and sorrows of marriage. For historians, this piece offers a valuable glimpse into the social anxieties and grim perspectives held by young girls in colonial Korea regarding their future roles and the institution of marriage, suggesting a critique of traditional female life paths embedded within children's culture. The juxtaposition of childhood play and themes of death and marital despair is particularly striking.
