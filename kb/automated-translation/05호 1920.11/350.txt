On a moonlit night on Hansan Island (閑山섬), sitting alone on the watchtower (戍樓),

With a great sword buckled at my side, deep (깁흔) in sorrow (설음),

From whence (어대서) comes the single sound of a barbarian flute (一聲胡笳), breaking my heart (斷我膓)?
(By Yi Chungmugong) <120>

**Summary**

This short Sijo poem, attributed to the famed Admiral Yi Sunsin (Yi Chungmugong), depicts a moment of solitude and deep sorrow experienced by the admiral while on watch during the Imjin War. Sitting alone on a watchtower on Hansan Island, sword at his side, his grief is intensified by the distant, mournful sound of a flute. For historians, the publication of this poem in *Kaebyŏk*, a magazine known for its nationalist leanings during the Japanese colonial period, is significant. It represents a subtle yet potent invocation of Korean historical resistance against Japanese aggression, using a revered national hero figure to foster patriotism and potentially critique the contemporary colonial situation.

閑山섬 달 밝은 밤에 戍樓에 혼자 안저
큰 칼 엽헤 차고 깁흔 설음 하는 차에
어대서 一聲胡笳는 斷我膓을 하는고.
