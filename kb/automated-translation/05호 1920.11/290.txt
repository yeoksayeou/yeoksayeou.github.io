漢詩 (Hansi - Chinese Poetry)

逍遙晩晴 (Strolling on a Clear Evening)
黙齋 (Mukchae)
Surveying the mountain light, my eyes fill with green,
I watch the pointed rocks, like a natural pavilion they seem.
Forest birds chase each other, entirely emerald bright,
Springs and stones harmonize, awakening the senses fully.
The ancient hall, indistinct, as if entering a dream,
Autumn flowers, glittering, bloom all over the courtyard.
Such maple woods, hard to capture and keep,
Yet forcibly breaking one branch gives a special fragrance.

逍遙 (Strolling)
(On a day planned for strolling Soyosan Mountain, a friend did not arrive, so I walked alone, lonely. Midway, I met the Chungang Alumni excursion group and walked with them.)
石溪 (Sŏkkye)
Soyosan Mountain is called Little Kŭmgang,
Exploring the near views, the distant views are also fine.
Why fuss over a missed appointment at this time?
Meeting companions midway is also quite wondrous.
The well dug by predecessors can now be remembered,
The palace is empty, its ancient traces—who will know them later?
After chanting poems, I completely forgot the late return,
Among the maples, the red sun has already shifted west.

望鄕 (Gazing Toward Home)
滬上過客 (A Passerby in Shanghai) 張素石 (Chang So-sŏk)
On the banks of the Yangtze River, the rain has just cleared,
Evening mist and withered willows are immediately heartless.
This body wishes to become an arrow before the wind,
Flying straight to Hanyang, light as a single feather.
Beyond the buildings at the edge of my sight, the land is limitless,
The water level stretches to the distant sea, a lone sail.
The setting sun covers ten thousand li, the sky vast,
Gazing and gazing, wandering, only I am alone.
Clouded mountains vast and indistinct, the water like the sky,
At sunset, the wind in the trees carries the autumn message.
Ten thousand li on a river raft, thoughts of sorrow extreme,
A single cry of a returning wild goose flies off without end.
At dusk, by green trees, a solitary tower stands,
The rolling Yangtze River flows emptily on its own.
The mountains and rivers of my homeland are now far away,
Sorrow adds to the parting grief, autumn upon autumn. <108>

秋夜讀陶集有感 (Thoughts on Reading Tao [Yuanming]'s Collected Works on an Autumn Night)
木春學人 (Mok Ch'un Hagin)

一 (One)
The Great Fire star flows to the western river,
An austere air fills the edge of heaven.
Dew rests cleanly on the courtyard grass,
The cicada's voice is cold on the old branches.
My old garden is cut off by the distant sea,
My life circumstances are like a drifting stalk.
A traveler north of the Han longs to return home,
Through the long night, my soul is frequently startled.
In the flask, my wine is mellow,
Beside the bed, my zither lies horizontally.
Let me get drunk, walk, and sing,
Wanting to pour out the sorrow in my heart.
Sending the years away with knife and brush (clerical work),
I regret neglecting learning, already too late.
Ten springs and autumns of physical toil,
Looking back, everything was wrong.

二 (Two)
Human life is thirty thousand days,
One-third is lost.
Time passes like flowing water,
Thinking of it makes one shiver with cold.
I stroke the ancient and sigh for the present,
Turning the yellow-covered books before the window.
Deeply worried about the millennia to come,
I regret not having the art of long vision.
The prime of life does not come again,
One day cannot have two dawns.
One must strive in time,
The years and months do not wait for people.
How could Master Tao deceive me?
As a self-warning, I write this on my sash.
Let no one laugh at my poor imitation,
I myself uphold my own truth.

三 (Three)
The beauty of Dongshan (East Mountain) is present,
In Nanyang, the desire to sleep is satisfied.
Pitiable Xie Anshi,
Single-handedly held up a collapsing situation.
Pitiable old Waryong (Sleeping Dragon),
Exerted himself to the utmost, dying in Bashu.
Recalling the past evokes great sighs,
To whom can I speak the feelings in my heart?
The flourishing bamboo below the window,
Will it not also face frost and snow?
The clear wind and bright moon,
One can greedily take them without refusal.
Having wine yet not getting drunk,
Heaven laughs at my foolishness.
Lifting my head, I gaze at the universe,
Myriad sights present wondrous forms.

四 (Four)
The eldest son is Washington,
The younger son is Napoleon.
After these two departed,
The crowd of sons are all dogs and pigs.
Within the world, there is no alliance leader,
Powerful rivals contend, each honoring themselves.
Desolately, on this earth,
With whom can I discuss current affairs?
Tired of hearing sordid talk,
I befriend the ancients facing a fragrant wine cup.
A gentle breeze enters the courtyard trees,
One pillow, a dream settles peacefully.
Not knowing wrong from right,
How can there be disgrace or glory?
Vast between heaven and earth,
What things are profit and fame? <109>

**Summary**

This collection presents four sets of poems in Classical Chinese (Hansi) by Korean authors. The poems cover traditional themes: appreciation of nature's beauty ("Strolling on a Clear Evening," "Strolling"), longing for home while abroad ("Gazing Toward Home"), and reflections on life, time, study, and history inspired by reading the classical poet Tao Yuanming ("Thoughts on Reading Tao's Collected Works on an Autumn Night"). The poets express personal feelings of solitude, nostalgia, regret, and philosophical contemplation, often using natural imagery and historical allusions. From a colonial history perspective, Chang So-sŏk's poem from Shanghai vividly portrays the poignant yearning for Hanyang (Seoul), reflecting the displacement experienced by Koreans during that era. Mok Ch'un Hagin's lament about wasted time on "clerical work" and the concluding reflection on the lack of great leaders ("dogs and pigs") compared to Washington and Napoleon, while framed classically, might subtly comment on the contemporary political vacuum and disillusionment under colonial rule.

漢詩
逍遙晩晴
黙齋
歷略山光滿眼靑, 尖巖看作自然亭. 林禽相逐通身翠, 泉石交鳴盡意醒, 古殿依俙如入夢, 秋花的
皪遍開庭. 楓林如許收難得, 强折一枝別有馨.
逍遙
山逍遙之日約友不至獨行踽踽中路逢
中央校友遠足團與之同行 石溪
逍遙山號小金剛, 近景探餘遠景宜. 一時違約何湏怪, 中路逢綠亦是奇. 井在前人今可記, 宮虛古蹟後誰知. 吟罷渾忘歸去晩, 楓間紅日已西移.
望鄕
滬上過客 張素石
楊子江頭雨乍晴, 暮煙衰柳便無情. 此身願作風前矢, 直到漢陽一羽輕. 眼際樓邊地極無, 水平海遠一帆孤. 夕陽萬里天空濶, 望望徘徊惟獨吾. 雲山茫漠水如天, 日暮樹風秋信傳. 萬里河槎愁思極, 一聲歸鴈去無邊. 黃昏碧樹一孤樓, 滾滾長江空自流. 故國山川今已遠, 愁添別恨秋更秋.＜108＞
秋夜讀陶集有感
木春學人
一
大火流西河, 肅氣盈天端. 庭草宿露潔, 老枝蟬語寒. 故園絶海隔, 身世等漂梗. 漢北思歸客, 永夜魂頻驚. 甁中我酒熟, 床頭我琴橫. 且醉行且歌, 欲訴衷膓悲. 刀筆送歲月, 失學悔已遲. 形役十春秋, 回首事事非.
二
人生三萬日, 三分失其一. 居諸若流水, 思之自寒慄. 撫古又嘆今, 窓前繙緗帙. 深憂千載下, 恨無久視術. 盛年不重來, 一日難再晨. 及時須勉勵, 歲月不待人. 陶君豈欺我, 自警聊書紳. 效嚬人莫笑, 吾自任吾眞.
三
東山美人在, 南陽睡意足. 可憐謝安石, 隻身持傾局. 可憐臥龍老, 鞠躬死巴蜀. 懷古發洪嘆, 向誰語心曲. 榮榮窓下竹, 詎無霜雪時. 淸風與明月, 貪取不須辭. 有酒且不醉, 天公笑我癡. 擧首望宇宙, 萬目呈奇姿.
四
大兒和盛敦, 小兒那波崙. 二子一去後, 羣兒盡犬豚. 宇內無盟主, 列雄互自尊. 寥寥地球上, 時事與誰論. 厭聞齷齪語, 尙友對芳罇. 微風入庭樹, 一枕夢自平. 不知非及是, 焉有辱與榮. 悠悠天壤際 何物是利名.＜109＞
