浮雪道人의 八竹頌

此竹彼竹化去竹, 風打之竹浪打竹.
是是非非看彼竹, 飯飯粥粥生去竹.
賓客接待家勢竹, 市井買賣時勢竹.
萬事不如吾心竹, 然然然世過然竹.＜118＞

This bamboo, that bamboo, transforming bamboo,
Wind-hit bamboo, wave-hit bamboo.

Right and wrong, looking at that bamboo,
Rice, rice, porridge, porridge, living bamboo.

Guest-receiving family-power bamboo,
Marketplace buying-and-selling trend bamboo.

All things are unlike my heart's bamboo,
Yes, yes, yes, the world passes, yes bamboo. <118>

**Summary**

This short, eight-line poem by "Pusŏl Toin" (Floating Snow Sage) uses the word "bamboo" (竹, chuk) repetitively at the end of each line, creating a rhythmic effect and playing on homophones (like 죽 for porridge and bamboo). It contrasts different aspects of life – nature's forces, societal judgments, daily sustenance, social status, commerce – with the poet's inner state ("my heart's bamboo"). The poem ends with a sense of acceptance or resignation towards the transient nature of the world. For historians, this poem from *Kaebyŏk*, a prominent nationalist magazine during the colonial era, might be interesting for its potential allegorical meaning. The resilient yet buffeted bamboo could symbolize Korea or the Korean people under duress, while the contrast between external pressures (societal norms, commerce) and inner resolve ("my heart's bamboo") could reflect a search for spiritual or national identity amidst colonial assimilation policies and social upheaval.
