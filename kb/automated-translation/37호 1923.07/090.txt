Correction

Regarding the article "Poch'ŏn'gyo Followers' Trip to Chŏngŭp" (普天敎徒井邑行) on page 59 of this magazine's May issue, it was stated that individuals Messrs. Sim Kŭn-ho (沈根鎬), Kang Tu-sŏp (姜斗爕), Kang Tae-ch'ŏl (姜大喆), Chŏng Sŏng-ho (鄭成鎬), Kim Hyŏng-kwŏn (金亨權), and Ch'ŏn Sŏk-ku (千錫九) had an audience (謁見) with the Poch'ŏn'gyo leader Cha Ch'ŏnja (車天子). However, among them, Messrs. Kang Tae-ch'ŏl (姜大喆) and Kim Hyŏng-kwŏn (金亨權) had absolutely no involvement (初無하다) in participating with that group. We hereby issue a correction (正誤함). <66>

**Summary**

This brief notice corrects a previous article published in the May 1923 issue of *Kaebyŏk* magazine. The correction clarifies that two individuals, Kang Tae-ch'ŏl and Kim Hyŏng-kwŏn, were mistakenly reported as being part of a group of Poch'ŏn'gyo followers who visited the religious leader Cha Ch'ŏnja in Chŏngŭp; the magazine states they did not participate. For historians, this correction is interesting because it explicitly dissociates two named individuals, particularly Kim Hyŏng-kwŏn (uncle of Kim Il Sung), from a reported meeting with the leader of Poch'ŏn'gyo, a major new religious movement often under surveillance during the colonial period. This highlights the magazine's effort for accuracy and potentially reflects the sensitivity surrounding association with such groups.
