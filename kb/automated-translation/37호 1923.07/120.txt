The Praiseworthy Japan-Korea Harmonization Policy of Mr. Saitō
Governor-General Saitō, who had gone to attend the funeral of his former feudal lord out of unforgettable gratitude for past favors, returned safely to his post in early June. Among his remarks upon returning was a maxim, a Japan-Korea harmonization policy praiseworthy beyond compare in the world. Specifically, regarding the migration of Koreans to Japan, he stated, "Korean laborers have low wages, are obedient, and their efficiency is gradually increasing. They readily engage in low-class labor that Japanese people most detest, such as cleaning toilets and sewers. Therefore, it is preferable to welcome them rather than needing to exclude them. (Middle part omitted - original text) Furthermore, if Japanese people residing in Japan were to relocate to the relatively undeveloped Korea and engage in its development, the realization of co-existence and co-prosperity for Japanese and Koreans could be foreseen," and so on. Right, that's it. Does Japan-Korea harmonization mean that Koreans go to Japan only to clean toilets and sewers, while Japanese come to Korea, seize the Koreans' fertile fields and fine rice paddies, and live comfortable lives in tall buildings and grand mansions? Your words are truly those of a Governor-General ruling Korea, words confessed from the conscience, nakedly discarding all the falsehoods that successive Governors-General have spoken about working for the happiness of Koreans. This must indeed be the great plan for Japan-Korea co-existence and co-prosperity.

The Habitual Cunning of the Wealthy
Viscount Min Yŏnghwi clearly stated this spring to Mr. Yi Sŭnghun, associated with the Chŏngju Osan School, that he would fund the construction of the school building. He even requested secrecy, saying that if this fact were published, requests for donations from various places would flood in. Mr. Yi, believing the Viscount's words as firmly as iron and stone, went down to Chŏngju, prepared the architectural plans for the school, and visited the Viscount. However, the Viscount just played Go with a certain close friend, pretending not to see him. Only after 30 minutes did he finally stop the sharp clicking sound of the Go stones, open his mouth, and bring up the school building issue. In the end, despite his previous promise, the Viscount coolly refused. Ah, is this not the habitual cunning of the wealthy?

Promoting Athletics or Promoting Fundraising?
Recently, athletic meets like soccer tournaments and tennis tournaments hosted by various organizations are being held frequently. On the surface, this seems to greatly encourage physical education. However, looking behind the scenes, participating organizations are burdened with costs exceeding the actual expenses, and high admission fees are charged to spectators, showing a purely profit-oriented flavor. It is questionable whether engaging in profit-seeking activities under the guise of promoting sacred physical education<77> is appropriate. This matter requires more awakening and attention.

The Frightening Japanese "China Carts"
Recently, small two-wheeled horse carts have been seen frequently kicking up dust on the streets of Kyŏngsŏng. This is the work of two Japanese men, Yagi Kichi (207 Chŏksŏn-dong) and Tomiyama Takeshige (29 Suŏyŏng-jŏng), who will seemingly jump into a trap if there's profit involved. They purchased 30 "China carts" (支那馬車) and are using Chinese drivers to transport passengers. Their business area covers Kyŏngsŏng city, Inch'ŏn, Suwŏn, and the Uidong area. The fare is 20 chŏn for two passengers within 5 chŏng (approx. 545m), with an additional 3 chŏn for each extra chŏng. A full day costs 4 wŏn 50 chŏn, half a day 3 wŏn, and one hour 50 chŏn. The fares are relatively cheap, and it is said many people are riding them, perhaps drawn by the novelty of the two-wheeled horse carts. Since this is just the beginning, it's unknown what the impact will be yet, but if, as the operators plan, hundreds more carts are purchased and put into use, several hundred Korean rickshaw pullers could lose their livelihood overnight. This is a major crisis for the labor world.

A Second Dr. Kubo
Not long after the death of Kubo, who once stirred up controversy by insulting Koreans as barbarians, a "Second Kubo" incident has occurred at Kanggyŏngp'o Public Commercial School. A teacher at the school named Kayahara (茅原), known to be inherently ill-natured, constantly refers to Korean students as barbarians or rebellious subjects whenever something displeases him. He even stated that if he had the authority to carry out death sentences, he would chop off the heads of all Koreans. Unable to contain their indignation, the Korean students submitted a petition to the principal requesting Teacher Kayahara's replacement, but this was ignored. Consequently, students from the 2nd and 3rd years began a joint school strike on June 25th, and 1st-year students are also planning to join, making the situation reportedly quite intense. For a Japanese educator engaged in so-called assimilation education, it is advisable to issue an order for immediate dismissal (退朝令) to anyone with such a不良 (poor) disposition uttering absurd and reckless remarks. One wonders how the authorities will handle this.

A Proliferation of the Strange
Currently, many bizarre religions are emerging in Korea, but the aliases of their leaders are even stranger. In Pot'yŏn'gyo (普天敎), there lies hidden Ch'a Ch'ŏnja (車天子 - "Car Son of Heaven"); in Sit'yŏn'gyo (侍天敎), Kim Ch'ŏnja (金天子 - "Kim Son of Heaven"); and in Kaksegyo (覺世敎), Ku Ch'onggam (具總監 - "Director-General Ku"). How strange can it get?<78>

**Summary**

This article from the July 1923 issue of *Kaebyŏk* magazine presents a series of critical observations on contemporary Korean society under Japanese rule. It satirically dissects Governor-General Saitō's "harmonization" policy as a means to exploit Korean labor for menial jobs in Japan while Japanese colonize Korea's resources. It recounts an instance of a wealthy Korean nobleman breaking a promise to fund a school, criticizes sports events for prioritizing profit over actual athletic promotion, highlights the economic threat posed to Korean rickshaw pullers by new, cheaper Japanese-run horse carts, and reports on a Japanese teacher's racist remarks leading to a student strike. The article concludes by noting the proliferation of new religions with leaders adopting grandiose titles. From a historical perspective, the article offers a raw, critical Korean viewpoint on colonial policies, social inequalities, economic anxieties caused by Japanese enterprise, and the pervasive racism faced by Koreans, even within the educational system supposedly aimed at assimilation. Historians might find the specific examples of Saitō's rhetoric, the details of the horse cart business (fares, routes), the naming of individuals involved in conflicts (Min Yŏnghwi, Yi Sŭnghun, Kayahara), and the mention of specific new religious movements particularly valuable for understanding the social, economic, and cultural tensions of the period.

可尙한 齋藤君의 日鮮融和策
舊藩主의 恩을 忘키 難하야 其 喪에 赴하얏던 齋藤總督은 6月 上旬에 一路 平安이 歸任하얏는데 其 歸任談 中에는 世界에 其 比가 無한 可尙의 日鮮融和策인 格談이 잇다. 卽 朝鮮人 日本移住에 對하야 君은 曰하되 「朝鮮人의 勞働者는 勞銀이 低廉하고 잘 從順하며 能率도 漸次 늘어가서 日本人의 最히 嫌忌하는 便所 掃除와 下水溝 掃除와 如한 低級의 勞働에 잘 從事하는 터인즉 寧히 此를 歡迎함이 可하고 排斥할 必要는 無하며 (中畧-원문) 且 日本에 在한 日本人은 比較的 未開한 朝鮮에 轉住케 하야 其 開拓에 從事케 하면 日鮮人 共存共榮의 實現을 可見하겟다」 云云하얏다. 올치 그럿치 朝鮮人은 日本에 가서 便所나 下水道만 掃除하게 하고 日本人은 朝鮮에 와서 朝鮮人의 良田美畓을 奪取하고 高樓巨閣에서 安樂한 生活을 하게 하면 日鮮融和가 된단 말인가. 君의 말은 참 朝鮮을 統治하는 總督의 말이고 歷代 總督이 朝鮮人의 幸福을 爲한다는 虛僞의 일을 다 버리고 적나라하게 良心으로 告白한 말이다. 이것이 果然 日鮮人 共存共榮의 良策인가 보다.

狡猾한 富豪의 常習
子爵 閔泳徽氏는 今春에 定州 五山學校 校舍를 建築하야 준다고 仝校 關係者 李昇薰氏에게 明言하고 또한 이 事實이 世上에 發表되면 各地의 寄附請求가 踏至할 터이니 秘密에 附하라고까지 附托하얏다. 李氏는 閔子의 말을 鐵石과 가티 밋고 定州에 나려가서 그 學校 建築 設計書를 作成하야 가지고 閔子를 訪問한 즉 閔子는 某 親友와 가티 바둑만 두고 본 척도 안이 하다가 30分 以後에야 비로소 丁丁한 落子聲을 멈치고 開口하야 말이 校舍 問題에 至하얏는데 結局 閔子는 前의 承諾이 有함을 不拘하고 冷靜하게 拒絶하얏다 한다. 아- 이것이 富豪의 狡猾한 常習이 안인가.

體育獎勵인가 收金獎勵인가
近日에 某某 단체의 主催로 蹴球大會니 庭球大會니 하는 것이 頻頻이 열인다. 이것은 表面으로는 體育을 매우 獎勵하는 것 갓다. 그러나 그 內幕을 보면 참가단체에 對하야 實費 以上의 費用을 負担하고 또 觀覽者에게 高價의 入場料를 바더서 純然히 營利的 氣味가 多하니 神聖한 체육 獎勵의＜77＞ 名을 賣하야 營利的 行動을 하는 것이 穩當하다 할지 좀더 覺醒하고 注意할 일이다.

可恐한 日本人의 支那馬車
近日 京城 市街에는 조고마한 雙頭馬車가 먼지를 피우고 만이 돌아단인다. 이것은 利益이라면 陷井이라도 들어가랴고 惡을 쓰는 日本人 八木吉(積善洞 207番地)과 富山武盛(壽榮町 29番地) 兩人이 支那馬車 30臺를 購入하야 가지고 支那人 馭者를 使用하야 乘客을 運搬하는 것이다. 其 營業區域은 京城府, 仁川, 水原, 牛耳洞 一帶의 地오. 賃金은 5丁 以內 2人乘 20錢, 5丁 以上 1丁을 더할 時마다 3錢을 더 밧고 全 1日에는 4圓 50錢, 半日에는 3圓, 1時間에는 50錢이라는데 賃金이 比較的 低廉하고 즉어도 雙頭馬車 바람에 만이들 탄다 한다. 只今은 츠음이 되야서 아즉 影響이 엇더한지 不知하거니와 營業者의 計劃과 가티 數百臺을 더 購入하야 此를 使用한다 하면 朝鮮의 人力車軍幾 100名은 一朝에 其 生業을 失할지니 勞働界의 一大 恐惶이다.

第二의 久保博士
朝鮮人을 野蠻이라고 侮辱하야 一時의 問題를 惹起하던 久保가 死한지 未久에 江景浦 公立商業學校에는 第二 久保의 事件이 發生되얏다. 卽 同校 敎員 茅原이란 者는 元來 性質이 不良한 者로 朝鮮人 學生에게 무슨 不快한 일이 잇스면 恒常 野蠻人이니 亂臣賊子니 하며 또 自己가 死刑을 執行할 權利만 잇스면 朝鮮人을 모조리 목을 잘너 죽이겟다 함으로 朝鮮人 學生들은 憤을 참다 못하야 校長에게 茅原敎師를 改選하야 달나고 陳情書까지 提出하얏스나 此를 不聽함으로 6月 25日부터 2, 3學年 學生이 同盟 休學을 하고 또 1年級 生徒도 將次 加盟하랴고 하야 形勢가 자못 猛烈하다 한다. 所謂 同化敎育을 하는 이 무엇을 하는니 하는 日本人 敎育者로서 加斯히 根性이 不良하야 悖談忘言을 하는 者는 一日이라도 速히 退朝令을 下함이 可하다. 當局에서는 如何히 措處하랴는지.

奇怪百出
現今 朝鮮에는 奇奇怪怪한 宗敎가 만이 생기지만은 그 敎主의 假名이 더욱 奇怪하다. 普天敎에는 車天子 侍天敎에는 金天子 覺世敎에는 具總監이 伏在하얏다. 此가 何等 奇怪인가.＜78＞
