Kyŏngsŏng Citizen's Private Epidemic Hospital Enveloped in Suspicion, Director Chŏng Ŭngsŏl's Son Secretly Sold the Land Site to a Japanese Person

Around the transition from summer to autumn in Taishō 9 (1920), when cholera (虎列刺) was prevalent in Kyŏngsŏng, the facilities of the government-established epidemic hospitals were incomplete and inadequate, resulting in many patients being sacrificed. Motivated by this, 189 influential figures within Kyŏngsŏng Prefecture (including 16 aristocrats) initiated the establishment of the Kyŏngsŏng Citizen's Private Epidemic Hospital on October 5th of the same year. After distributing a prospectus everywhere, they held a grand inaugural meeting at the Jongno YMCA Hall on the 7th and decided on various matters concerning the establishment of the epidemic hospital. First, they organized the Kyŏngsŏng Citizen's Private Epidemic Hospital Establishment Preparatory Committee (京城府民私立避病院 設立期成會) and elected officers. The President was the customary Pak Yŏnghyo (朴泳孝), like licorice in a pharmacy; the Vice President was Min Pyŏngsŏk (閔丙奭); the Standing Directors were Chŏng Ŭngsŏl (鄭應卨), Pak Haemuk (朴海黙), Yu Pyŏngnyong (柳秉龍), Kim Ilsŏn (金一善), Yi P'ungjae (李豐載), and Ch'ae Kidu (蔡基斗). The estimated budget for the project was a total of 200,000 wŏn, designed as follows:

I. Total 200,000 Wŏn
Breakdown
1,800 Wŏn: Hospital Site, 2,000 p'yŏng at 90 chŏn per p'yŏng
30,000 Wŏn: Building on the same site, 300 p'yŏng at 100 wŏn per p'yŏng
7,500 Wŏn: Equipment Costs
10,700 Wŏn: Various facilities, medicine, and instrument costs
150,000 Wŏn: Maintenance Fund
Total: 200,000 Wŏn

However, this 200,000 wŏn was to be raised through donations from civic-minded individuals. Pledged donations reached about 50,000 wŏn, and the initial founding expenses of 6,000 wŏn were contributed by Count Song Pyŏngjun (宋秉畯) (3,000 wŏn) and Viscount Min Pyŏngsŏk (閔丙奭) (3,000 wŏn). In the spring of the year before last, they finally began purchasing the site, acquiring about 1,500 p'yŏng of land in Tongsomun Outer Sŏngbuk-tong (東小門 外城 北洞) for 1,150 wŏn in cash. They started site repair work, but due to strong opposition from the residents of the entire Sŏngbuk-tong area, much expense was wasted, and they were forced to halt construction. Afterwards, while searching widely for a site, the Kyŏnggi Province Police Chief and the Head of the Sanitation Division designated Count Song Pyŏngjun's land near Hyŏnjŏ-dong outside Sŏdaemun (西大門 外 峴底洞) (managed by the Agricultural Company run by Mr. Song) as a suitable location. Mr. Song also agreed to lease it. However, at that time, the land had already been leased by the Agricultural Company to Sŏdaemun Prison, so it could not be used before the lease expired (until the end of March this year) <67>, leading to delays and the issue remaining unresolved to this day. So, what has this so-called Citizen's Private Epidemic Hospital actually achieved in the four years since its inception, and how is the collected money being managed? If we reveal the inside story now, it is truly heart-chilling and suffocating, with many things that cannot easily be told to others. Specifically, the 6,000 wŏn in founding expenses was entirely consumed by various expenses of a few executives, without even securing a single office room. The 1,500-odd p'yŏng in Sŏngbuk-tong (purchased for 1,150 wŏn) was registered under the name of Chŏng Ŭngsŏl, who was the so-called chief director at the time of purchase. After Mr. Chŏng died the year before last, his son, Chŏng Chaebong (鄭在鳳), secretly sold it to a Japanese person in Inch'ŏn, Kitajima Shigeji (北島重司). Because of this, Chŏng Chaebong was convicted of fraud and embezzlement and is currently serving time in Sŏdaemun Prison, but the land was completely lost. Although this incident occurred last [year? - text corrupted: 昨幊�分], the executives of the hospital preparatory committee kept it secret, deceiving and manipulating the general citizenry. This reporter also learned the details at the time but remained silent until now, not so much for the sake of the executives' reputations, but out of concern that it might hinder the project's progress. I simply hoped sincerely that the executives would quickly sort it out, handle it well somehow, whether overtly or covertly, without exposing the shame of the general citizenry. However, those responsible give no thought to recovering the land embezzled and sold by Mr. Chŏng or demanding compensation for the cost to restore the original state, and they continue to overlook it nonchalantly to this day. Given that Mr. Chŏng Ŭngsŏl was originally known to all as an ambitious man, what was the reason for registering the land solely under his name at the time of purchase? And even if it was registered under Mr. Chŏng's name, who is responsible for being completely unaware until his son, Chŏng Chaebong, sold it to a foreigner? This is something the general citizenry will surely, with one voice, openly condemn as irresponsible. Not only that, but when asked under whose name and in which bank the supposedly currently held 12,000 wŏn in cash is deposited, there is no clear answer, only vague and ambiguous talk. There are many cases in the world where people exploit the good name of public interest to satisfy personal greed, but no one could have dreamed that such an unfortunate incident would occur within this Epidemic Hospital Preparatory Committee. As things have come to this, it is unknown what attitude the general citizenry will take, and what measures the executives will devise to resolve the situation. First, the opinions of those involved in the hospital preparatory committee and influential citizens are as follows.

I Have No Face to Show Society
Mr. Pak Haemuk's (朴海黙) Statement

Although there are nominally several standing directors on our Epidemic Hospital Preparatory Committee, in reality, I am the only one handling the actual work. These days, I've come here (inside the Tongnipkwan in Kwandong) and borrowed someone else's office, <68> so I haven't even put up a sign. During this time, the amount of donations pledged on paper is roughly 50,000 wŏn, but due to the financial panic and other circumstances, not all of it could be collected. About 12,000 wŏn has been collected in cash, and this is deposited in a certain bank under the President's name. Regarding Chŏng Chaebong's matter, we still wish to keep it secret and not expose it. However, since your company (貴社) is already aware of the facts, I will speak. Originally, when Chŏng Ŭngsŏl was a director of this committee, somehow the land site was purchased under his own name, and the documents were kept by the committee. Then, after Mr. Chŏng died, his son, Chŏng Chaebong, used clever means to secretly sell it to a Japanese person. At that time, the committee was completely unaware. Upon later discovery, we filed a complaint, and as a result, Mr. Chŏng received a guilty verdict and is currently serving his sentence. We are struggling to either recover this land site or at least get compensation from Mr. Chŏng, but things are not going as planned, and the situation remains unchanged. This is truly shameful to face society. Regarding the hospital establishment, fundraising has not ceased, creating various difficulties, and the land issue is particularly problematic. After the failure in Sŏngbuk-tong, we searched various places and designated the area near Sŏdaemun Prison. However, this land is under the jurisdiction of the Agricultural Company managed by Count Song Pyŏngjun. Although Mr. Song had already agreed to the lease, the company holds opposing views, preventing a swift resolution. In any case, we plan to negotiate again with Count Song, and if we can secure the land site, we intend to construct the hospital building. It seems likely that donations will only be collected after construction begins. However, with such unpleasant incidents occurring, progress seems truly difficult.

The Initiators Themselves Were Irresponsible From the Start
(Mr. Yu Chint'ae's (兪鎭泰) Statement)
I am neither an initiator of the Private Epidemic Hospital establishment nor directly involved, so I cannot say much about the matter. However, initially, the hospital's founding office was adjacent to the Chosŏn Education Association (朝鮮敎育協會) office, and the executives were all acquaintances, so I heard about most things. That hospital had unfortunate incidents from the beginning. For instance, in the autumn of the year before last, there was an incident where certain office staff members conspired and spent over 400 wŏn of collected funds. At that time, because I had recommended a certain Mr. Song from Yŏngdong (永同) as an office staff member, I ended up paying 50 wŏn in compensation. In relation to this, there was talk from somewhere about conducting an audit of funds and goods, and I saw Mr. Pak Haemuk, one of the executives, looking very worried. I believe Mr. Pak, being responsible, must have dealt with this 400 wŏn somehow and covered it. Regarding the incident of Chŏng Chaebong secretly selling the hospital site, I also heard the general details at the time. However, the reason for keeping it secret was not just for the sake of the Epidemic Hospital, but out of concern that it would become a disgrace <69> to our nation and greatly hinder future projects. Even when fundraising for the People's University (民立大學) project, I encountered many people asking skeptically if it wouldn't end up like the Epidemic Hospital. This is truly disheartening and frustrating. I thought the matter had been properly resolved in the meantime, but hearing that the land has still not been recovered nor the money received is deeply regrettable. Even these days, I hear a lot of negative talk about the Epidemic Hospital, but I think rather than blaming a few executives, the initiators and donors should be held more responsible.
That is, for any matter, it is naturally best to exercise sufficient oversight routinely to prevent such abuses from occurring. Furthermore, if an unfortunate incident does occur, it should be promptly investigated and sorted out, and dealt with directly, regardless of who is found responsible. Merely criticizing it like someone else's problem in public discourse is not good. Also, regarding the 6,000 wŏn founding cost, although I don't know the details, there would naturally have been entertainment expenses for fundraising activities, staff salaries, and other costs, so surely no one embezzled (乾沒) it. However, since there are few results to show for the work and the expenses were considerable, there seems to be public criticism again. In any case, exposing such matters could be shameful for the citizenry and might also hinder future projects. Whether you decide to publish this or not is up to you; I am just saying a word because you asked.

Public Handling is Best
Statement from a Certain Initiator

As one of the initiators, it is truly embarrassing to say that I was completely unaware of this fact. However, I really did not know about this incident. We initiators trusted the current executives and hoped that the work would proceed smoothly and the so-called Citizen's Private Epidemic Hospital would be established even one day sooner. But hearing that such an unexpected incident occurred leaves me speechless. In our Korean society, where people are already reluctant to pay mandatory contributions (義務金), the occurrence of such an event makes it truly difficult even for sincerely dedicated individuals to initiate projects and gain sympathy. In any case, since things have come to this, it must be dealt with promptly. Whether by holding an initiators' meeting or through some other format, countermeasures must be devised. I don't know why the executives kept it secret, but it is only right to disclose the facts as they are and handle the matter properly. Being hindered by formalities and appearances and handling things ambiguously is, on the contrary, a transgression. In my opinion, it is appropriate for the press to expose this quickly so that general society can handle it openly. -(One Reporter)- <70>

**Summary**

The article exposes a scandal surrounding the Kyŏngsŏng Citizen's Private Epidemic Hospital Preparatory Committee, established in 1920 to address inadequate cholera treatment facilities. Despite raising significant pledges and initial funds from prominent figures like Pak Yŏnghyo and Song Pyŏngjun, the project stalled. The core issue revealed is that land purchased for the hospital, registered under director Chŏng Ŭngsŏl's name, was secretly sold to a Japanese individual by Chŏng's son after his death. This embezzlement, alongside earlier financial mismanagement and general inaction by the committee, led to public disillusionment and accusations of irresponsibility among the organizers and donors. The interviews reveal internal conflict, attempts to keep the scandal secret, and concerns about its impact on future public fundraising efforts like the People's University.

From a colonial history perspective, this article is revealing. It highlights the difficulties Koreans faced in organizing large-scale civic projects under Japanese rule, hampered not only by potential colonial interference but also by internal corruption and mismanagement. The involvement of prominent figures, some known for collaborating with the Japanese regime (like Song Pyŏngjun), adds complexity. The sale of Korean-owned land (intended for public good) to a Japanese individual underscores the economic and social vulnerabilities of Koreans during this period. Furthermore, the expressed fear that this scandal would damage public trust and future fundraising efforts (like for the nationalist-driven People's University) shows the fragility of Korean civil society initiatives and the corrosive effect of such failures. Historians might find the specific details of the committee structure, fundraising methods, land acquisition process, interactions with colonial authorities (police, sanitation dept.), and the subsequent cover-up attempts valuable for understanding the socio-political dynamics of 1920s colonial Korea.

疑雲에 包圍한 京城府民 私立 避病院, 理事 鄭應卨의 子가 基地를 日人에게 偸賣
大正 9年 秋夏之交에 京城에 虎列刺가 流行할 時에 官設 避病院의 施設이 不完不備함으로 因하야 多數의 患者를 犧牲에 供하얏다. 此를 動機로 하야 京城府內 有力者 189人(內 貴族 16人)은 京城府民私立避病院을 設立하랴고 仝年 10月 5日에 發起하야 趣旨書를 各地에 宣布한 後 仝7日에 鍾路 基督敎靑年會舘에서 盛大한 發起會를 開하고 避病院 設立에 對한 諸般 事項을 議決하얏다. 爲先 京城府民私立避病院 設立期成會를 組織하고 役員을 選擧하얏스니 會長은 藥局에 甘草格으로 例의 朴泳孝 副會長은 閔丙奭, 常務理事는 鄭應卨, 朴海黙, 柳秉龍, 金一善, 李豐載, 蔡基斗 諸氏엿고 事業計劃의 槪算은 摠 金額 20萬圓으로 하야 左와 如히 設計하얏다.
一. 金 20萬圓也
內譯
金. 1,800圓 病院基地 2천坪 每坪 90錢
金. 3만圓 仝上家屋 300坪 每坪 100圓
金. 7千500圓 備品費
金. 壹1만700圓 諸般設備, 藥品 及 器具代
金. 15만圓 維持金
計 金 20만圓也
然而 此 20萬圓은 寄附의 形式으로 民間有志에게 寄附金을 募集하야 前後 承諾金이 約 5萬餘圓에 達하고 創立費는 伯爵 宋秉畯氏가 3천圓 子爵 閔秉奭氏가 3천圓 計 6천圓을 出捐하얏다. 再昨年 春에 비로소 基地 買入에 着手하야 東小門 外城 北洞예 約 1천5백餘坪의 基地를 現金 1천150圓으로 買收하고 基地 修繕工事에 着手하다가 城北洞 一帶 住民의 極力 反對로 因하야 多數의 工費만 虛費하고 不得已 工事를 中止하게 되얏다. 其後 各方으로 基地를 廣求하던 中 京畿道 警察部長 及 衛生課長이 西大門 外 峴底洞 附近에 在한 宋秉畯氏의 基地(宋氏의 經營하는 農業會社 所管)를 適合한 場所로 指定한 바 宋氏도 또한 此를 貸付하기로 承諾하얏다. 그러나 當時에 그 基地는 農業會社에서 旣히 西大門監獄에 貸付한 者인 故로 期限(今年 3月 末日까지) 到來前에는 또한 此를＜67＞ 使用하기 不能함으로 遷延 歲月하야 今日까지 問題 中에 잇다. 그러면 此 所謂 府民私立避病院은 發起된지 4個 星霜에 果然 何를 實現하얏스며 且 其 收入된 金錢은 如何히 管理하는가. 今예 其 內幕을 公開하면 實로 心이 寒하고 氣가 塞하야 可히 他人으로 하야금 聞케 못할 事가 多하다. 卽 6천圓의 創立費는 事務室 1間도 準備치 못하고 幾個 幹部의 무슨 費, 무스 費로 全部 消費되고 城北洞에 在한 1천500餘坪(1천150圓에 買入한 者)은 當時 買入할 時에 所謂 摠理事로 在하던 鄭應卨의 名義로 登記를 하얏다가 再昨年예 鄭氏가 死한 後에 其子 鄭在鳳이가 此를 仁川에 在한 日本人 北島重司에게 暗賣하얏다. 此로 因하야 鄭在鳳은 詐欺橫領罪로 處刑되야 現在 西大門監獄에서 服役하나 其 土地는 白失하고 말엇다. 此 事實은 旣히 昨幊�分에 發生된 것이나 仝 病院旣成會 幹部는 此를 祕密에 附하고 一般의 府民을 欺瞞 籠絡하얏다. 本 記者도 當時에 其 事實을 詳知하얏스나 尙今 黙然 看過한 것은 其 幹部의 軆面을 爲함보다 事業 進行에 故障이 有할가 하야 不問에 附하고 但히 忠心으로 其 幹部가 速速 整理하야 一般 府民의 羞恥를 暴露치 안이하고 有耶無耶間에 善히 措處하기만 期待하얏다. 그러나 其 責任者는 如何한 方法으로던지 彼 鄭氏의 橫領 賣渡한 其他를 追尋하던지 代金을 辨償하야 原狀回復할 事는 念頭에 置치 안이하고 今日까지 泰然 看過한다. 彼 鄭應卨은 元來 世人이 皆知하는 野欲家임을 不拘하고 買收 當時에 鄭氏의 單獨名義로 登記케 한 것은 何等의 理由이며 且 鄭氏의 名義로 登記하얏다 할지라도 其子 鄭在鳳이가 外人에게 賣渡하기에 至하기까지 全然 不知한 것은 其責이 何人에 在한가. 此는 一般 府民이 異口同聲으로 堂堂히 其 無責任한 것을 共討할 것이다. 그뿐안이라 現在 保管하얏다는 所謂 現金 1만2천圓도 何人의 名義로 何銀行에 預置하얏는지 此를 問하면 明白한 答이 無하고 曖昧朦膿하게 說去한다. 世에 共益의 美名을 賣하야 私慾을 充하는 事가 多하지마는 此 避病院期成會에 如斯의 不祥事를 演出할 줄은 何人이던지 夢想도 안이 하얏슬 것이다. 事가 此에 至하매 一般 府民은 果然 如何한 態度를 持하며 其 幹部된 諸氏는 如何히 善後의 策을 講究하는지 不知하거니와 爲先 同 病院期成會 當務者와 府民의 有力者 諸氏의 意見은 左와 如하다.

社會에 對할 面目이 업습니다
朴海黙氏談

우리 避病院期成會의 常務理事는 名色 여러 사람이 잇지만은 實際上 일을 맛터보기는 나 한 사람뿐이올시다. 요새이는 여긔(館洞 獨立舘內)에 와서 남의 事務室을 빌어＜68＞ 잇기 때문에 看板도 부치지 못하얏습니다. 그 새이에 寄附된 金額은 文書上으로는 畧 5萬餘圓이 되나 財界 恐慌과 其他 事情으로 다 收入이 되지 못하고 現金으로 畧 1만2천圓만 收入되얏는데 이것은 會長의 名義로 某 銀行에 預置하얏슴니다. 鄭在鳳의 일로 말슴하면 아즉 秘密에 부치고 暴露코자 안이함니다. 그러나 貴社에서 旣知한 事實이니까 말슴함니다. 元來 鄭應卨이가 本會의 理事로 在할 時에 엇지 되얏던지 自己名義로 基地를 買收하고 文書는 本會에 保管하얏슴니다. 그런데 鄭氏가 死한 後 其子 鄭在鳳이가 巧妙한 手段을 用하야 日本人에게 暗賣하얏슴니다. 其時에 本會에서는 全然 不知하얏다가 追後 發覺하고 此를 告訴한 結果 鄭氏는 有罪判決을 受하야 現在 服役하는 中이올시다. 우리는 이 基地를 차저내던지 그러치 안으면 代金이라도 鄭氏에게 바더드리랴고 苦心함니다만은 일이 如意치 못하야 아즉까지 그대로 잇슴니다. 이것은 참 社會에 對하야 面目이 업슴니다.그러고 病院 設立에 對하야는 寄附金이 것치지 안이하야 여러 가지가 困難한 中에 基地問題가 더욱 困難함니다. 城北洞에서 失敗본 後로 各處로 廣求하다가 西大門監獄 附近으로 指定되얏스나 이것도 宋伯秉畯氏의 經營하는 農業會社 所管으로서 宋氏는 旣히 貸付를 承諾하얏스나 會社가 反對의 意見을 持함으로 因하야 早速히 歸決되지 못함니다. 何如間 宋伯과 다시 交涉하야 基地만 得하게 되면 病院집을 建築하랴고 생각함니다. 寄附金도 工事를 着手한 後 라야 募集이 될 것 갓슴니다. 그런대 이러케 不美한 일만 생기고 보니 進行되기가 참 어렵겟슴니다.

發起人부터 無責任하외다
(兪鎭泰氏 談)
나는 私立避病院 設立發起人도 안이오 直接 關係者도 안이니까 그 일에 對하야 무엇이라고 말슴할 수 엄슴니다. 그러나 當初에 그 病院의 創立事務所가 朝鮮敎育協會 事務所와 接近되고 또한 그 幹部도 다 親知인 故로 大槪의 일은 들어 알엇슴니다. 그 病院은 처음부터 不祥事가 잇섯슴니다. 卽 再昨年 秋에 事務員 某某가 共謀하고 收入된 金額 400餘圓을 消費한 事가 잇섯는데 其時에 내가 永同사는 宋某를 事務員으로 推薦한 事가 有한 까닭으로 50圓을 賠償한 일이 잇섯슴니다. 此에 對하야 某處에서 金品調査를 한다는 말이 잇서 幹部되는 朴海黙氏가 매우 憂慮하는 氣色을 보왓슴니다. 此 400圓은 勿論 朴氏가 責任者이니까 如何히 措處하얏던지 補充하얏슬 줄로 암니다. 그리고 鄭在鳳의 病院基址暗賣 事件으로 말슴하면 나도 其時에 大槪는 들엇슴니다. 그러나 秘不發說한 것은 避病院을 爲함보다 우리 民族의 羞恥가＜69＞ 되고 將來事業에 大妨害될가 念慮함임니다. 民立¤§學事件으로 寄附金募集을 하는데도 避病院가티 되지나 안이하겟느냐고 懷疑 反問하는 이를 만이 보왓슴니다. 이것은 참 寒心하고 긔가 막힘니다. 나는 其間에 잘 措處된 줄 알엇더니 아즉까지 基地도 찻지 못하고 代金도 밧지 못하얏다 하니 대단한 遺憾으로 생각함니다. 요새 이에도 避病院에 對하야 惡評이 만히 잇는 것을 들엇슴니다만은 나는 생각하기를 幹部 몃 사람을 責하는 것보다 發起人이나 寄附金 내인 그 사람을 더 責하고 십슴니다.
卽 무슨 일이던지 平素에 十分 監督하야 이러한 弊害가 生치 못하게 함이 可한 것은 勿論이고 且 不美의 事가 發生하얏스면 速速히 調査 整理하야 何人에게 歸責 되던지 直接으로 處理할 것이오. 空然이 言論으로 남의 일가티 批評하는 것이 좃치 못한 일이올시다. 또 創立費 6千圓으로 말슴하면 亦是 詳細한 일은 알지 못하나 寄附金運動이니 무엇이니 하는데 自然 招待費도 잇고 事務員 月給 其他 費用에 썻슬 터이니까 누가 乾沒은 勿論 업슬 터이올시다. 그러나 일의 成績은 別로 업고 費用은 多大하니까 世評이 또 잇는 듯 함니다. 何如間 이러한 일을 暴露하는 것은 府民의 羞恥가 되고 또한 將來 事業에 妨害가 될 듯도 함니다. 記載與否는 알어 하시려니와 나는 무르시니까 한 말슴할 뿐임니다.

公開處理가 最可

나는 發起人의 一人으로 事實을 全혀 알지 못한다 하는 것을 참 부끄러운 이올시다. 그러나 이 事實은 果然 알지 못하얏슴니다. 우리 發起人은 現 幹部를 信用하고 아모조록 일이 잘 進行되야 一日이라도 所謂 民間私立避病院의 設立되기만 希望하얏더니 千萬 意外의 이러한 事實이 發生되얏다 하니 엇더타고 말슴할 수 업슴니다. 가뜩이나 義務金을 내기 실혀하는 우리 朝鮮社會에서 이러한 일이 發生되고 보니 果然 진심으로 하는 사람도 事業을 着手하기 어렵고 同情도 엇기 어렵슴니다. 何如間 事實이 여긔에 이르럿스니까 早速히 處理치 안이 하면 안되겟슴니다. 發起人會를 한번 열던지 다른 形式으로 하던지 하야 善後策을 講究해야 하겟슴니다. 幹部는 무슨 意思로 秘密에 부치엿는지 不知하거니와 事實은 事實대로 公開하야 正當히 處理하는 것이 當然함니다. 形式과 體面에 拘礙되야 일을 우물쭈물하는 것은 도로혀 罪過올시다. 내의 意思까지는 言論界에서 此를 早速히 暴露하야 一般社會에서 公公히 處理하도록 하는 것이 當然한 줄 암니다 -(一記者)-＜70＞
