Foreword to the "Shanghai Edition": For the Cultural Exchange Between Internal and External Regions
						By Samch'ŏlli President Kim Tonghwan

This journal is now publishing the "Shanghai Special Edition." Shanghai is truly the most crucial point of the newly rising China; not only is it China's main artery politically, militarily, economically, and culturally, but it also plays an important role in the newly progressing construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Accordingly, it is a place to be regarded seriously, both now and in the future, for the advancement of Koreans into Central China. Therefore, mobilizing our company's Shanghai branch office, we are putting out this special edition. However, amidst the rush, it is not entirely without points where manuscript collection was inadequate, but we intend to supplement this by putting out second and third installments at appropriate opportunities in the future. Through this, we only pray that there will be a contribution to the cultural exchange between Shanghai and Chosŏn. Furthermore, this journal will continue to publish special editions for the regions listed below whenever the opportunity arises in the future.

Manchukuo Special Edition, North China Special Edition, Dutch East Indies, French Indochina Special Edition<113>

**Summary**

This editorial foreword by Kim Tonghwan, president of the magazine *Samch'ŏlli*, announces the publication of a special Shanghai edition. He emphasizes Shanghai's importance in the "newly rising China" and its role in the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," framing the special issue as a means to facilitate cultural exchange between Shanghai and Korea (Chosŏn) and aid Korean advancement into Central China. The foreword acknowledges potential shortcomings due to haste but promises future installments and plans for similar special editions focusing on Manchukuo, North China, the Dutch East Indies, and French Indochina. For historians, the article is revealing in how a Korean cultural magazine positioned itself within the Japanese imperial project, explicitly referencing and seemingly endorsing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and promoting Korean activity within newly occupied territories like Shanghai as part of this sphere. It highlights the complex role of cultural production and exchange under colonial rule and wartime expansion.
