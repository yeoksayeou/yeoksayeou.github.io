**Body Text Translation:**
Literature on Pathology and Treatment Explanations (Free presentation to those who apply describing their disease name and condition)

Acute and chronic nephritis (督廢炎), cystitis (膀䏯炎), [obscured] gland inflammation (■謨腺炎, likely prostatitis), gonorrhea (滑病), diabetes (消渴), hematuria (血尿), bedwetting (寢小便), and genital diseases (生殖器病) are caused by factors such as colds (感胃), getting chilled (冷込), fatigue (退勞), exhaustion from military service (兵役의 衰弱), unhealthy lifestyles (不攝生), or related to other illnesses and food (患病及食物의 關係等). Additionally, invasion by E. coli (大腸菌) or tuberculosis bacteria (結核菌), and infection with gonorrhea poison (淋毒), etc., are extremely common.
Any of these are troublesome, intractable diseases (難病) that are difficult to cure easily. They worsen again due to [obscured] changes (■■의 變化) and neglecting one's health (不養生), and easily cause dangerous [obscured] complications (危險■發症). It is truly regrettable that very many long-suffering patients (從來羅患者) wander among various therapies and ultimately find no effect, worrying without others knowing. However, these diseases (本病) are definitely not incurable (不治), and are fully curable diseases, so one must absolutely undergo fundamental treatment (根本治療) with an accurate treatment method (正確한 治療法) without letting the disease condition (病勢) worsen.
The Jiryōdō Urology Drug Specialty Clinic (自療堂泌尿藥專門院) at Nishi Sannen-zaka, Oka Kōen, Wakayama City (和歌山市岡公園西三年阪), which has been repeatedly introduced in this magazine (本誌上) for its research on urinary and venereal diseases and self-treatment methods (自療法) and has an excellent reputation (大端評判), has published treatment literature (療法文獻, fixed price 35 sen [錢]) for regrettable chronic patients, explaining in greatest detail and kindness various symptoms (病狀), causes (原因), [obscured] methods (■生法, likely health maintenance methods), dietary regimens (食物養生法), special drug therapies (特殊의 藥劑療法), etc. Aiming for the relief (救濟) of patients with intractable diseases, being wholeheartedly devoted (全部秘心하고), please write urgently (至急히) mentioning that you saw this in the April issue of the 16th year of Samch'ŏlli (三千里十六年四月號) for each disease and symptom.
Fortunately, there are truly many letters reporting full recovery (全快體狀) from those overjoyed that the intractable disease they suffered from for years (年來) was completely cured (完治) at home (自宅에서) and does not recur (再發하지안는다). We earnestly urge (간절히 勸합니다) everyone to use this therapy as quickly (速히) as possible, even for a moment (一刻이라드).<140>

**Summary**

This article is an advertisement from the April 1941 issue of the Korean magazine *Samch'ŏlli* for the Jiryōdō Urology Drug Specialty Clinic in Wakayama, Japan. It promotes a self-treatment guide (available for 35 sen) for various urinary and venereal diseases, including nephritis, cystitis, gonorrhea, diabetes, and genital diseases. The ad emphasizes the difficulty of curing these conditions, the social stigma attached ("worrying without others knowing"), and claims its methods offer a complete, at-home cure without recurrence, citing numerous testimonials. It lists causes like colds, fatigue, military service exhaustion, unhealthy lifestyles, and bacterial infections.

From a historical perspective, the article is interesting as it advertises a Japanese clinic and its mail-order treatment guide to a Korean audience during the late colonial period, showing cross-border medical marketing within the empire. The mention of "exhaustion from military service" as a cause reflects the increasing mobilization pressures of the time. The focus on self-treatment and secrecy highlights contemporary social anxieties surrounding diseases like STDs and the potential limitations or distrust of available healthcare options for Koreans.
