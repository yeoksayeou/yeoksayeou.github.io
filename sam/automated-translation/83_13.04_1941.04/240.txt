Impressions of a Shanghai Personality, Mr. Kim Kyŏngjae, Vice President of the Shanghai Times

When I met Mr. Kim Kyŏngjae (金璟載), he mentioned he had previously served as an executive in some organization (團體幹部).
However, from my perspective, he didn't seem like that sort of person at all. Not only was his physique not particularly large, but he readily engaged in conversation with anyone, whether adult, child, or servant (給仕), blinked his eyes more often than he spoke words, and had a habit of laughing easily. Also, he would frankly speak his mind regardless of who was present and laugh like a child for quite a while; no matter how you looked at it, he didn't seem like someone who had acted as a leader (頭領) or a prominent figure (巨頭).

Some time ago, after about five years, I met Mr. Kim again. He was said to be serving as the Vice President of a newspaper company called the Shanghai Times (上海時報) in Shanghai.
"Sir, are you really the boss?"
Because he still talked easily with anyone, blinked his eyes frequently, and laughed like a child, I asked him this. At that, Mr. Kim asked, "Why?" and again laughed freely and unrestrainedly. Then he said, "Actually, someone taught me how to act like a boss..."
Perhaps sensing the meaning behind my words, he said this and shifted slightly in his chair, starting to stand up.
"They told me to walk like this."
Mr. Kim put his hands behind his back and demonstrated a stride of about one *ja* (자) per step, walking 뚜벅뚜벅. "And for laughing, don't go 'hahaha,' but 'hŏ-hŏhŏ,' and the pause between the 'hŏ' sounds must be very slow," he said, demonstrating the laugh. "Also, when someone calls you, don't just quickly turn your head, but turn your whole body after about a ten-minute [exaggeration for 'long'] pause," he added, mimicking the action. Then he laughed heartily again.
"Still like a child," I muttered to myself.
However, isn't it perhaps this inability to put on airs, like a child, that has allowed Mr. Kim to gain the trust (信任) of others to this day? <144>

**Summary**

The author recounts meeting Kim Kyŏngjae, the Vice President of the Shanghai Times, both in the past and recently. Despite Kim's high position and past role as an organizational executive, the author is struck by his child-like demeanor: his small stature, easy laughter, frequent blinking, and tendency to speak frankly and informally with everyone, regardless of status. Kim playfully demonstrates the 'proper' way a boss should walk, laugh, and react, highlighting his own lack of pretense. The author concludes that Kim's genuine, unpretentious nature is likely the source of the trust others place in him. From a historical perspective, this piece offers a personal glimpse into a Korean figure involved in the media landscape of Shanghai during a complex period. It is interesting for its focus on personality and character rather than overt political or nationalistic activity, providing a more nuanced portrait of Korean life and work abroad under Japanese rule.

上海人士의 印象, 上海時報 副社長 金璟載 氏
내가 金璟載氏를 만났을 때 그 분은 過去에 어느 團體幹部 지내였다고 했다.
그런데 내가 보기엔 도무지 그런 것 같지 않았다. 體格이 別로 크지 못할 뿐더러 어룬이건 아이건 給仕건 거리지 않고 이얘기를 잘하고 말마디보다 눈 깜짝깜짝하는 도수가 더 많고 또 잘 웃는 버릇이 있었다. 그리고 누구의 앞이건 상관치 않고 막 털어놓고 한참씩 어린애처럼 웃으시는데 아무리 하도야 頭領이나 巨頭노릇을 한 것 갓지 않았다.
얼마 前 한 5년만에 다시 氏를 만나게 되었다. 上海서 上海時報라는 신문사 부사장으로 계시다고 한다.
「선생님 정말 사장입니까」
前이나 마찬가지로 아무보구나 이얘기하고 눈을 깜짝깜짝하니고 또 어린애처럼 잘웃으시기 때문에 나는 이렇게 물었다. 그랬드니 氏는 「웨요」 하며 또 자꾸 아무렇게나 함부로 막우 웃었다. 그러다가 「그러잖아두 날더러 사장노릇하는 법을 가르처두군...」
내 말의 뜻을 알아채린 셈인지 이렇게 말하며 의자에서 옴쭉 일어셔셨다.
「걸음은 이렇게 걸으래」
씨는 뒤짐을 집고 뚜벅뚜벅 한자 가웃씩 되는 步法을 해뵈이고 「웃음은 「하하하」로 하지 말고 「허-허허」로 그것도 그 「허」字 사이가 대단히 느레야 한 대」 하고 웃어뵈이고 또 「누가 불르면 얼른 고개만 돌리지 말고 약십분 사이를 두고 몸전체를 술려야 한대」하며 그런 시늉도 해뵈이었다. 그리고 나선 또 죽자코 웃으시었다.
「여전히 어린애같군」 나는 혼자 중얼거렸다.
하지만 씨가 오늘까지 남의 信任을 받게 되는 것은 이 어린애같이 꾸밀 줄 모르는데 있는 것이 아닐까. ＜144＞
