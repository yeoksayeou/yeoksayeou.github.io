The Actual Situation of Koreans in Shanghai
						By Yi Kap-ryŏng (李甲寧), Chairman of the Shanghai Korean Residents' Association

I wish to express my heartfelt congratulations on the occasion of "Samch'ŏlli," one of Korea's foremost journals of opinion, publishing a "Shanghai On-the-Spot Special Issue." Although I am not skilled in writing, I felt it was one of my duties to convey the current activities of our fellow countrymen in Shanghai, and so I draft this manuscript. Therefore, I ask for your indulgence regarding its stylistic clumsiness.

One: Number and Trends of Resident Compatriots
Historically, Shanghai has not necessarily been an honorable or comfortable paradise for us Koreans. Readers are already well aware of this without my needing to describe it now, so I will omit the details here. Until just before the current Incident (今事變), the number of those who had formally submitted residency registrations according to Consulate orders was merely just over 1,400. Additionally, there were about 300 individuals considered undesirable elements, or who considered themselves as such, along with their families. In total, only slightly more than 1,600 resided here. Subsequently, when the current Incident erupted in August of Showa 12 (1937), about 70% evacuated to their homeland. Around 400 people shared life and death in evacuation shelters under the control of the Korean Association (朝鮮人會), and a few remained in the International Settlement and French Concession (佛兩租界) as Chinese nationals, staying in this land until the very end. Reflecting the victorious campaigns of the Imperial Army (皇軍) in the Incident and the establishment of peace and order throughout Central China, coupled with the dramatic expansion of Japanese influence, the population (especially of fellow countrymen from the Peninsula) suddenly surged. As of the end of October last year, it leaped to 4,668 households with a population of 7,855 (4,984 males, 2,871 females), and it continues to gradually increase with each ship arrival. This number represents those who have submitted residency registrations; it is imagined that a considerable number beyond this also reside here. Their trends are shown <118> as follows.

[Table data not transcribed]

This table shows the number of people traveling by ship; those who traveled by train from North China via Nanjing are not included.
As the table above indicates, the population is increasing steadily. Due to recent travel restriction orders, sea voyages to China, especially Central and South China, have become extremely difficult. However, since it is possible to summon family members who require support, the increase is due to resident compatriots summoning their families as their lives stabilize. <119>

Two: Occupations and Living Conditions

Previously, the standard of living for us Koreans was relatively poor. They eked out a living engaged in occupations not particularly worthy of pride, such as small merchants, clerks, tram and bus conductors, dancers, and waitresses. There are various reasons for this, which I will convey on another occasion, but in any case, the situation was quite pitiable. However, since the current Incident, accompanying the advance of Imperial power, the economic development of Koreans has been particularly remarkable. They are actively engaged in trade, pacification work (宣撫), transactions, etc., and are now building a considerably solid economic foundation. Their standard of living has rapidly improved, surpassing that in Korea proper (鮮內), even giving the impression of drifting towards luxury (奢侈). This is entirely due to Imperial benevolence (皇恩). According to a recent survey by the Korean Association, the situation is as shown in the table below, giving a sense of being worlds apart from the past.

[Table data not transcribed]

Beyond the table above, there are also a considerable number who could not be surveyed. To give an example of the improvement in compatriots' living standards: before the Incident, there was only one small private car, whereas now there is a large number, including 26 private passenger cars, 18 commercial trucks, and 22 taxis for business use. These automobiles serve as a barometer of urban life, especially in the international city of Shanghai.
Although I hesitate to write this, previously, the number of compatriots committing police-reportable crimes was relatively small. Recently, however, coinciding with the rapid population increase, many arrive in Shanghai after wandering from Manchuria and North China. Consequently, the rise in various criminal offenses and violations of administrative regulations is truly dishonorable for our compatriots and a cause for deep concern. Observing that such criminals are often those who have come from Manchuria and North China, one can infer their past and present life and disposition (氣心) in those regions.

Three: Business Startups

Previously, due to generally low levels of knowledge and a lack of assets and credit, there were no particularly noteworthy enterprises, only a few establishments like pharmaceutical manufacturing, fountain pen manufacturing, sundry goods stores, cafés, etc. During the current Incident, as shown in the occupational table above, people have become active in various businesses and have now built considerable foundations. However, these are so-called "war nouveaux riches" resulting from military scrip (軍票) inflation in militarily occupied areas and monopolistic trade and transactions in the interior (奧地). It is absolutely unthinkable that such favorable objective conditions will continue in the future. Since the spring of last year, due to the economic blockade strategy, policies to maintain the value of military scrip, and the strengthening of enterprise controls and other measures, it appears that our compatriots' businesses, which continued inexperienced and lax (放漫的) management utterly lacking solidity, are gradually being severely affected. This should be called reaping what one has sown (自業自得) due to the compatriots' lack of self-awareness <121> until now. If the current situation persists and compatriots do not abandon their previous methods and mindset, it is more than imaginable that they will fall into even greater difficulties, and bankruptcies (倒産) will likely occur one after another.

Four: Education Situation

Previously, in the French Concession, there was the private Insŏng School (仁成學校) and its attached kindergarten, strongly colored by anti-state sentiments, which misguided the education and future of our promising children. The Korean Association (朝鮮人會), under the objective "Proper education of children makes for loyal subjects," established the Yangjŏng Kindergarten (養正幼稚園). It aimed to prepare compatriots' children for entry into Japanese elementary schools (日本小學校) and progressed with utmost effort. (In November of Showa 10 [1935], following advice from the Consulate authorities, Insŏng School was closed.) Meanwhile, efforts were made to encourage students attending schools run by Chinese or foreigners to transfer to Japanese elementary schools. As a result of the gradual awakening and courageous decisions of parents and guardians, considerable results were being seen. (I use the phrase "parents' courageous decision" because the persecution and obstruction by rebellious Koreans (不逞鮮人) were quite strong, so transferring or enrolling children in Japanese elementary schools truly required courage.) Due to the current Incident, compatriots who had previously underestimated Japan's power and maintained an opportunistic (日和見的) attitude have awakened. Now, almost all are transferring or enrolling their children in the various schools established by the Japanese Residents' Association (日本民團立). The fact that the education issue has achieved such splendid results is truly gratifying. The Yangjŏng Kindergarten, which this association has painstakingly managed, started with only 7 children at its opening but now has 151, with an expected enrollment of 230 this coming April—an astonishing increase. Last autumn, thanks to the special goodwill of the Shanghai Special Naval Landing Party (上海特別陸戰隊) and the support of the Government-General of Korea's Shanghai Resident Officers (朝鮮總督上海駐在官各位) and resident compatriots, the kindergarten building underwent a major renovation costing 67,000 yen. With a four-story building of 350 tsubo (approx. 1157 sq meters) floor space and a 900 tsubo (approx. 2975 sq meters) playground, it has become the number one fully equipped kindergarten not only in Shanghai but in all of China, regardless of nationality, which is one of the prides of the Shanghai resident compatriots.
Looking back, the consequences of the mistaken educational policies for children adopted by resident Peninsula compatriots in the past have become clearly apparent now. It is beyond the imagination of readers how poor the content of the aforementioned Insŏng School, as well as Chinese-run and foreign-run schools, was, and how many defects incompatible with us they possessed. The mistaken education resulted in nothing but the tragedy of creating fragmented individuals with misguided spirits and national character out of important youths with promising futures. It goes without saying that our efforts were undertaken anticipating this outcome, but it is only recently that parents have come to understand and appreciate the feelings of us leaders. <122>

Five: Health and Medical Situation

Compatriots residing in Shanghai generally have greater economic power compared to compatriots in mainland Korea. As urban dwellers, hygienic ideas are reasonably widespread, and they have frequent opportunities to use clinics. Just as there are many quite skilled physicians from mainland Japan (日本內地人) here, they are also found among Peninsula people. Currently, there are six clinics operated by Peninsula compatriots here, but it seems they mostly cater to Chinese patients. Due to factors like medicine prices and other treatment costs, they do not appear to be developing much.

Six: Shanghai Korean Residents' Association (上海居留朝鮮人會)

(1) General Overview
It is a well-known fact that Shanghai was previously a base for rebellious Koreans (不逞鮮人) who constantly obstructed the progress of our compatriots. From the spring of Showa 9 (1934), due to the awakening of Koreans residing in Hongkou (虹口), the "Ch'in'uhoe" (親友會 - Friendship Association) was organized with the late Mr. Yu In-sŏng (柳寅聲君) as chairman, intending to finally start activities. However, he was shot by rebellious Koreans and passed away (逝去). Following him, Mr. Yi Ch'ang-ha (李昌夏君) became chairman, with the late Vice-Chairman Yi Yong-ro (李容魯副會長) and Mr. Yi Sŏng-gun (李聖君君) as general affairs manager, forming a team and beginning activities toward the intended goals. However, due to financial difficulties, internal disunity, and various other obstacles (障碍), progress was not as desired. The executives at the time sought a meeting with me, and after discussing strategies for the development of the association, which served as the guiding body for compatriots, it was decided to entrust everything to me. On March 3, Showa 10 (1935), a general meeting was held, the dissolution of the Korean Association (朝鮮人會) (formerly Ch'in'uhoe) was declared, and the Shanghai Korean Residents' Association (上海居留朝鮮人民會) was newly organized under the rules I proposed. I was newly appointed chairman on that day and have served until today. On the 25th of the same month, Mr. Yi Yong-ro was also assassinated (暗殺) by rebellious Koreans. From the beginning, considerable obstruction from rebellious Koreans and danger to my own person were expected, and since my goal was their proper guidance (善導), I felt not the slightest fear. The late Mr. Yi was given an association funeral, which was the grandest compatriots' funeral in the past and present. I myself was shot by rebellious Koreans in November of Showa 12 (1937) but survived. Thus, three precious lives were shed to build this association into what it is today. At that time, the association had no financial resources, and even for monthly expenses of around 120 yen, I myself had to walk around soliciting funds from fellow compatriots and influential people. It may sound strange to say it myself, but I went through hardships many times greater than readers <124> might imagine. My sincerity gradually came to be recognized and sympathized with by various quarters. Finally, from October of the same year, thanks to the thorough support of Mr. Ueda (上田), then stationed in Shanghai and currently Governor of Aomori Prefecture (青森縣知事閣下), and then Vice-Consul Saeki Tasuke (佐伯多助副領事), we began receiving an annual donation of 3,000 yen from the Harada Sekizenkai (原田積善會) in Tokyo. We also received large subsidies from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (外務省), the Government-General of Korea (朝鮮總督府), the Shanghai Japanese Residents' Association (上海居留民團), etc. We undertook the task of guiding the ideology of resident Koreans and providing protection and nurturing, managed social enterprises such as the kindergarten, employment agency, and free lodging house, conducted surveys of economic data, provided consultation for new arrivals and businesses, mediated disputes among compatriots, offered personal counseling, published the monthly magazine "Kwanghwa" (光化), and have dedicated ourselves with meager strength to the development of our compatriots in various aspects up to the present day.
When the current Incident erupted in August of Showa 12 (1937), the rebellious elements who had previously entrenched themselves (蟠居) in the French Concession, constantly obstructing our activities and intimidating good compatriots, fled (遁去) to the interior. Koreans who had maintained an opportunistic attitude awakened, and our society in Shanghai became ideologically brightened. The attitude of the entire compatriot community towards the completion of the current Incident became clear.
Particularly when the flames of the current Incident ignited in the Shanghai area, the Shanghai resident compatriots, centered around this association, rose up fiercely. Amidst the rain of bombs and shells, they performed desperate service (決死的奉仕) for the Empire. Starting with the tear-inducing activities of the association's Youth and Adults Corps during the evacuation of Japanese nationals, this corps was subsequently fully mobilized. They worked unloading and transporting military supplies, constructing temporary airfields or hastily built positions, rushed to supply food to evacuated Japanese nationals, and further served as military interpreters and drivers, gathered intelligence on the front lines, collected and cared for the dead and wounded, and also endeavored in battlefield cleanup. Under the circumstances at the time, their desperate activities (決死的活動) (resulting in seven deaths and injuries) were no less than those of mainland Japanese (日本內地人). For this selfless, devoted (獻身的) activity, effort, and sincerity, they were equally recognized and highly praised by the military and various other quarters. Notably, then Foreign Minister Hirota (廣田外務大臣) and Governor-General Minami of Korea (南朝鮮總督) sent extremely cordial (懇切) letters of gratitude and certificates of merit (賞與狀) to this association, offering encouragement, as readers are already aware through numerous newspaper reports during that period. Following this, in Showa 13 and 14 (1938-39), they continued their awareness and tension as citizens on the home front (銃後), expressing all manner of sincerity (赤誠) from the home front. In this fiscal year, Showa 15 (1940), as the Incident becomes prolonged, they are continuing their devoted efforts to strengthen their awareness as local citizens and in home front support activities. The main points are summarized below:

(A) Donation to the Society for Honoring the War Dead (忠靈顯彰會)
Since the end of last year, a second collection was made for the Central China Society for Honoring the War Dead. Among Peninsula compatriots, 11,232 yen and 936 yuan (silver) were collected and donated on February 7th last year. <125>

(B) National Defense Donations by Peninsula Compatriots
Illustrating the sincerity of resident compatriots on the home front, spontaneous national defense donations, just counting those made through the Consulate-General Police Department (總領事舘警察署), amounted to 4,936.19 yen in Showa 13 (1938), 4,586.48 yen in Showa 14 (1939), and 2,982 yen in this fiscal year, Showa 15 (1940). Considering the poverty among resident compatriots, these amounts cannot be said to be too small.

(C) Dispatch of Influential Korean Women's Inspection Team to Mainland Korea
With the support of the Government-General of Korea's Foreign Affairs Department (朝鮮總督府外事部), four influential local women—Mrs. Kim Wŏn-gyŏng (金元慶), Mrs. Chang Mitsuko (張美津子) (a mainland Japanese), Mrs. Yi Ŭn-su (李恩洙), and Mrs. Yu Kŭk-kyŏm (劉克儉) (a Chinese)—were dispatched last April on an inspection tour to Korea and mainland Japan.

(D) Formation of the Kyerim Youth Group (鷄林靑年團結成)
Last September, the Kyerim Youth Group was formed at the Korean Association Hall.
Leader: Yi Kap-ryŏng (李甲寧)
Vice-Leader: Takashima Teruzō (高島輝三) Members: 148
It is a powerful, Nazi-style youth group with autocratic leadership by the leader, and since its formation, it has been actively engaged in various fields.

(E) Dispatch of Kyerim Youth Group Members' Inspection Team
To attend the 30th Anniversary Commemoration Ceremony of the Government-General of Korea's administration (朝鮮總督府始政三十週年紀念式), eight youth group members, representing the local youth, departed Shanghai on September 24th. They traveled via Dalian and Manchuria and attended the ceremony in Keijō (京城) on October 1st.

(F) Other
At the 30th Anniversary Commemoration Ceremony of the Government-General of Korea's administration, I was recognized as the sole private citizen contributor outside of Manchukuo, which is the highest honor (光榮至極).

Seven: Conclusion

Through the matters described above, I believe I have broadly introduced the recent situation of Koreans residing in Shanghai. As previously stated, while building our current position and foundation here was certainly aided by Imperial benevolence due to the Incident, the efforts of each individual cannot be ignored. Furthermore, the magnitude of the contribution made by the Shanghai Korean Residents' Association to the development of our compatriots requires no further argument here. Through the desperate efforts of the association's executives, the foundation for the development of today's Peninsula compatriots was built. Having achieved success and renown, it is now undergoing a developmental dissolution and merging with the Japanese Residents' Association (日本民留民團), realizing the true unity of Japan and Korea (內鮮一體) in letter and spirit.
Looking back over the past seven years evokes countless emotions, and it's impossible not to feel a touch of sadness. However, I even feel a sense of pride, like marrying off a daughter who has grown up beautifully and perfectly.
Although a new fellowship organization (親睦機關) will likely emerge to replace this association after its dissolution, even without a controlling body, I believe compatriots must strengthen their unity even further, strive to gain even greater honor than before, cultivate a more sound and serious life and spirit, prepare to overcome the even greater difficulties that are surely coming in the near future, steadily fulfill the heavy responsibilities and duties assigned to us as local residents, and thereby find the true meaning of our activities, path, and bright future. This is what I think, and also what I earnestly hope for.
As I conclude, I wish to say one thing to our compatriots in Korea: it seems many are yearning for Shanghai and attempting reckless voyages (波航) here (Continued on page 135) <127>

**Summary**

This 1941 article by Yi Kap-ryŏng, head of the Shanghai Korean Residents' Association, describes the situation of Koreans in Shanghai. He notes a significant population increase following the start of the Sino-Japanese War (1937), attributing improved economic conditions and rising living standards directly to Japanese imperial expansion ("Imperial benevolence"). He details efforts to promote Japanese education and steer children away from perceived anti-Japanese schools. The article outlines the association's activities, including social welfare, ideological guidance, dispute mediation, and fervent support for the Japanese war effort (donations, mobilization for labor/logistics, intelligence gathering). Yi recounts the dangers faced from "rebellious Koreans" (independence activists) and proudly notes the association's impending merger with the Japanese Residents' Association as a step towards "Naissen Ittai" (Japan-Korea Unity). He concludes by urging Koreans to remain loyal, work hard, and prepare for future challenges within the framework of the Japanese Empire.

From a historical perspective, the article is revealing for its explicit pro-Japanese stance coming from a Korean community leader during the colonial period. It showcases the strategy of collaboration and assimilation promoted by some Koreans, contrasting sharply with the independence movement (dismissed as "rebellious elements"). The detailed statistics on population, occupations, and wealth provide valuable data on the Korean diaspora in Shanghai, while the emphasis on education highlights the cultural dimension of colonial policy. The descriptions of the association's activities and its relationship with Japanese authorities (military, consulate, Government-General) offer insight into the mechanisms of control and co-option within the empire.

上海朝鮮人の實情
						上海居留朝鮮人民會長 李甲寧


朝鮮內の有數なる言論誌「三千里」が今度「上海現地特輯」を出す由滿腔の讃意を表し文筆に長じてゐない私ではあるが、現在上海に於ける我同胞の動靜を御傳へするのも義務の一つと思つたので、この稿を草する、だから文章的拙劣さは御寬赦願ひたい。

一、在留同胞數と動向
由來上海は我鮮人にとつては左程名譽あり、住み良い樂園ではたかつた。私が今記述する迄もなく讀者諸賢には先刻御承知のこと故玆には省略するが、今事變即前までは領事舘令に依る居留屆を正式に出してゐた者の數は僅に一千四百餘名で其他不良分子と認められ、また自らそれを自認した分子及びその家族の數が約三百で全體を合せても一千六百餘名しか在住してゐなかつた。その後昭和十二年八月今事變が突發するや、約七割の者が故國へ避難し朝鮮人會の統制の下に避亂所に死生を共にしたもの約四百名と共同、佛兩租界に支那人として居殘つたもの若干が最後までこの地に居殘つてゐた。それが事變皇軍の戰捷と中支一帶の治安恢復確立に基因する日本勢力の飛躍的發展に反映して人口(特に半島同胞)は俄然激增し昨年十月末現在に於ては一躍四、六六八戶人口七千八 百五十五人(男子四、九八四人 女子二、八七一人)に達し尙ほ船便每に漸增しつゝある狀態にある。以上は居留屆を提出してゐる者の數にしてこの以外にも相當數の者が居ると想像される。その動向を表＜118＞示すれば左の通りである。

右表の示す通り平均して增加してゐる。最近渡航制限令のため、支那殊に中南支への波航は非常に六箇敷くなつてゐるが、扶助すベき義務ある家族の呼寄せは出來るので、在留同胞の生活が安定につれその家族を呼寄せたゝだの增加である。＜119＞

二、職業及生活狀況

從來我鮮人の生活程度は比較的劣つてゐて、僅かに小商人店員、電車、パス監總、ダンサー、女給等あまり自慢にならない營業に從事しその曰くを暮らしてゐた。これには色々な理由があるが、またの機會に御傳へることにして、兎角憫れむべき狀態であつた。だが、今次事變以來、帝國勢力の進展に伴つて鮮人の經濟的發展は特に目覺しく、貿易、宣撫取 引等に活潑な働きなし、今で相當堅實な經濟的基礎を固めつゝあり、その生活程度も急速に向上し鮮內に於けるそれよりも高く、寧ろ奢侈に流る感さへある。これ全く皇恩外ならなぃ。最近朝鮮人會に於ける調査に依れば左表の通りであつて隔世の感がある。

半島人別資産階級表


右表以外にも調査不能の者も相當にある。同胞の生活向上の一例を擧れば事變前の自家用自働車は僅か小型一臺に過ぎなかつたものが現在では、自家用乘用車二六臺、營業用トラツク一八臺、タクシ營業用二二臺と云ふ多數に及び、都會生活殊に國際都市上海の生活のバロ、メーターの役をこの自働車が務めてゐる。
玆に書きたくないことではあるが、從來は同胞の警察的犯罪を犯す者比較的勘かつたのであるが、最近に於ては、人口の激增に伴ひ、滿洲、北支方面より流浪の果、上海に來るもの多く、從つて各種刑法犯、行政法規違反者が增加しつゝあることは誠に同胞の不名譽にして、寒心すべきことである。斯る犯罪者の多くは、滿洲、北支方面より渡來した者に多い處から觀ると、過去現在に於ける該地方の彼の生活と氣心がうかゞはれる。

三、起業狀況

從來一般的に知識程高くなく、且つ資產信用乏しかつたゝめ、格別特記すべき企業なく、僅かに製藥業、萬年筆製造業雜貨商、カフー等數軒しかなかつたものであるが、今事變中前記職業別表の示す如く、各業務に活潑に活動し、今では皆相當地磬を築いてゐる、だがこれは軍占領地域に於ける、軍票のインフレと貿易並に奧地取引の獨占的であつた爲めの所謂戰地成金であつて、今後共斯樣な客觀的好條件に惠れることは絶對に想像だに許されない。昨年春以來、經濟封鎖作戰軍票價値維持政策及び企業の統制其他の强化に依り漸次、無經驗と放漫的經營を續け全く堅實性を缺いてゐた我同胞の業者は深刻なる影響を受けつゝある模樣で、從來同胞の無自覺＜121＞による自業自得と言ふべきである。現狀が續き同胞が從來の方法と氣持を棄てない限りより一層苦境に陷り倒産業も續出するであらうことは想像して餘あるものがある。

四、敎育狀況

從來佛租界には反國家的色彩の濃厚な私立仁成學校とその附屬幼稚園があつて、將來ある我子第の敎靑と前途を誤らしてゐたが、朝鮮人會に於て「善良なる臣民には正しき子第の敎育にある」との目標の下に、養正幼稚園を開設して、同胞子第の日本小學校入校準備を目的に全力を盡して進み (昭和十年十一月領事舘當局の注意により仁成學校は閉鎖した) 一方支那人及び外人經營による學校在學生徒も日本小學校轉學を慫慂に努力した結果漸次學父兄の自覺と英斷により相當の結果を見つゝあつたが (父兄英斷と言ふ字句を使用したのは、不逞鮮人の迫害と妨害が相當に强力だつたから、日本小學校に轉學又は入學さすことは全く英斷を要した) 今事變により從來日本の實力を輕視し日和見的な態度であつた同胞の覺醒により現在では殆ど、日本民團立の諸學校へ轉入學させてゐて、敎育問題は立派な成果を見たことは欣快に堪へぬ次第である。本會が從來苦心經營して來た養正幼稚園も開設時の園兒數七名に過ぎなかつものが現在では一五一名となり今春四月には二百三十名になる見込みで驚ぐべき增加振りである。園舍は昨秋上海特別陸戰隊の特別なる好意と、朝鮮總督上海駐在官各位と在留同胞各位の聲援を得て、金六萬七千圓で大改修をなし、建坪三五〇坪の四階建の園舍と九百坪の運動場を有する、上海は勿論、全支に於ける內外人間を問はず、第一の完備した幼稚園となつたことは上海在留同胞の自慢の一つである。
顧るに過去に於ける在留半島同胞の誤つた所の子第の敎育方針が今になつてはつきりとその結果として顯れたのである前記仁成學校は勿論、中國系並に外國系の學校の內容が如何に貧弱であり、我等に相容れられない缺默が多いか讀者諸賢の御想像の及ぶものではない。誤つた敎育の結果大事な將來ある靑少年をして間違つた精神と國民性を持つ片端なものに作つた悲劇以外に何物もない。私等のこの結果あるを豫想してからの努力であつたことは勿論であるが、父兄等に於ても此頃になつて始めて、私等指導者の氣持を諒として感謝してゐる。＜122＞

五、衛生並醫療狀況

上海に在留する同胞は朝鮮內地の同胞に比し、大體に經濟力もあり、都會居住者として一應衛生思想も普及されてゐる狀態であつて醫院を利用する機會が多いのであるが當地には日本內地人の相當優秀な醫師が多い樣に、半島に見受けられ現在當地には半島同胞の經營に依る醫院は六箇所あるけれども大低は支那人患者を相手に經營を續けてゐる模樣で、それも藥價其他治療費の關係で餘り發展してゐない樣である。

六、上海居留朝鮮人會

(1) 一般槪况
從來上海は不逞鮮人の根據地であつて常に我同胞の發展を妨害して來たことは周知の事實であるが、昭和九年春から、虹口在住の鮮人の覺醒によつて故柳寅聲君を會長として「親友會」を組織して愈々事業を始めやうとした時に、不逞鮮人に狙擊され逝去して了つた。其の後を繼いて、李昌夏君を會長に故李容魯副會長、李聖君君を總務に陣容整へ所期の目的に向つて活動を始めたけれど、財政難と內部の不統一其他種々な障碍のため思ふ樣に進展しなかつたので當時の幹部が私に會見を求め、同胞指導機關たる該會の發展策に就き協議の後、私に一任することに決定したので、昭和十年三月三日總會を開き朝鮮人會(親友會を改稱)解體を宣言し私の提案による規則を以て、上海居留朝鮮人民會を新に組織し、その日會長に私が新任して今日に至つてゐる。同月二十五日李容魯君も不逞鮮人の手に暗殺されたのであるが、最初より不逞鮮人の相當な妨害と身邊の危險は覺悟の上であり、彼等を善導することが私の目的であつたので少の恐怖も感じなかつた。故李君は本會葬を以てし、過去現在に於ける最も盛大な同胞の葬式であつた。私も昭和十二年十一月やはり不逞鮮人に彈を受けたが、生命は取止められた。斯樣に今日の本會を成すまでには三人の尊い血が流れてゐる。當時は會の經理の財源なく、それて每月百二十圓位の支出にも、私自身が同胞有志間を步き迥つてゐた次第で自分で云ふのは可笑いが讀者諸賢の＜124＞想像される數倍以上の苦心をしたものである。私の誠意も漸次各方面より認められ、また同情される樣になつて、漸く同年十月より、當時上海在勤の現上田靑森縣知事閣下、並に當時の佐伯多助副領事の徹底的御支援により、東京原田積善會より年額三千圓宛の寄附を受け、外務省、朝鮮總督府、上海居留民團等より多額の補助金を得て、在留鮮人の思想善導及び保護撫育事業を擔常し、幼稚園、職業紹介所、無料宿泊所等の社會事業を經營し、經濟資料の調査、新渡航企業相談、同胞間の爭議調停、人事相談、月刊雜認「光化」等各般に亘つて同胞發展のため微力ながら專心努力して今日に至つた。
昭和十二年八月今次事變勃發するや、從來佛租界に蟠居して常に我々の事業を妨害し、善良な同胞を、脅迫してゐた不逞の後は奧地へ遁去し、日和見的態度を持してあつた鮮人は自覺し、上海の我社會は思想的に明朗になり。今事變完遂に對處すべき同胞全體の熊度は鮮明となつた。
特に今事變の戰火が上海方面に發火するや本會を中心とする上海居留同胞は玆に猛烈として立ち上り、爆砲擊彈雨下する間に帝國への決死的奉仕をなし、會所屬の靑壯年隊の邦人避難に際しての淚含しき活躍に始まり、引續きこの靑壯年隊を總動員し、或は軍需品の陸揚げ運搬に、或は臨時飛行場又は急設陣地構築に又避難邦人へ食糧供給に奔走し、更に軍通譯運轉手として、或は第一線情報蒐集に、死傷者の收容看護等に從事せしめ、尙戰場淸掃に努むる等、當時の情勢下に於ては日本內地人に優るとも劣らざる決死的活動 (七名戰死傷を出す) をなし、この忘私獻身的活動努力と誠意に對しては軍部其他各方面に於て等しく之を認め絶讚を受け、特に當時廣田外務大臣並に南朝鮮總督より本會宛最も懇切なる感謝狀と賞與狀を寄せ激勵されらたことは其間幾度に亘る新聞報導によつて讀者諸彥旣周知の通りである。これに引續き、昭和十三、十四年度於ても銃後國民としての自覺と緊强を持續し凡有銃後の赤誠を披歷して來たが、本十五年度に於ても事變の長期化と共に益々現地國民としての自覺强化に又銃後々援事業に獻身的努力を繼續しつゝあり、其の重な事項を摘記すれば次の通りである。

(イ) 忠靈表彰會ヘ獻金
昨年末以來中支忠靈顯彰會へ第二次寄金を募集した處、半島同胞間より金壹萬壹千二百三十二圓及銀九百三十六元を募集し、昨年二月七日之を獻納した。＜125＞

(ロ) 半島同胞の國防獻金
在留同胞の銃後の赤誠振りを物語る、自發的國防獻金は總領事舘警察署經由の分だけでも、昭和十三年度に四千九百三十六圓十九錢、同十四年度に四千五百八十六圓四十八錢、本十五年度二千九百八十二圓となつてゐて、貧困な在留同胞間の金額としては少額過ぎるとは言へないと思はれる。

(ハ) 有力朝鮮婦人朝鮮內地視察團派遣
朝鮮總督府外事部の後援を得て當地有力者夫人、金元慶、張美津子(內地人)李恩洙、劉克儉(中國人)の四名を昨四月朝鮮及內地へ視察に派遣した。

(ニ) 鷄林靑年團結成
昨年九月朝鮮人會舘に於て鶴林靑年團を結成し。
團長 李甲寧
副團長 高島輝三 團員 一四八名
となり、ナチス的な强力な團長專制の靑年團で其後各種各方面に亘り活潑な活動中である。

(ホ) 鷄林靑年團員の視察團派遣
朝鮮總督府始政三十週年紀念式參列のため、當地靑年を代表として、靑年團員八名九月二十四日上海出港大連、滿洲經由十月一日京城に於ける式典に參列せしめた。

(ヘ) 其他
朝鮮總督府始政三十周年紀念祝典に際し、滿洲國以外の海外に於ける唯一人の民間功勞者として私が表彰されたことは光榮至極である。

七、結論

以上記述した事柄によつて、上海在留鮮人の近況の大略は紹介したつもりであるが、前述の如く今日の當地に於ける我々の地盤と基礎を造るには、事變に依る皇恩に浴したことは勿論であるが、各人の努力も認めないわけには行かないし、特に上海朝鮮人民會が同胞發展のために資し、貢獻したる功績の如何に大なるかは玆に論を俟つまでもない。本會幹部必死の努力により今日の半島同胞の發展母體を造り上げ功なり名を遂げて、今回發展的解消をなし、日本民留民團と合體し文字通りの內鮮一體を實現せしむることになつてゐる。
過去七年間を顧みる時感慨無量なものがあり、一沫の淋しみを感じないわけには行かぬけれども、美しく完全に成長した娘を嫁入りさせる樣な誇りさへ感ぜられる。
本會か解消した後にはこれに代るべき親睦機關が出來ると思ふげれと統制體が無くなつとしても、同胞は愈々團結を堅め今より以上の名譽を揵得へる樣に努力し、もつと健實な眞面目な生活と精神とを涵養して近い將來に來るべきより以上の困難を克服すべき準備と我等に課せられた、重且責任と現地居留民としての義務を着實に果し、そして本當の意味の我々の活躍と進路と光明を見出すやうにしなればならないと思ふし、また切に希望して止まない次第である。
