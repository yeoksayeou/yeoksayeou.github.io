Notes of a Mainland Japanese University Student Killed in Action

*Translator's Note: These are the final writings of Naval Ensign Ikezumi Gorō (池住梧郎), a graduate of Waseda University's Faculty of Law, who died heroically in battle in South China on June 15th last year. He was 26 years old. These notes were found among his belongings.*

— In the navy, from the commander down to the sailors, everyone is full of energy and life. Truly, they are the pride of the Empire. I cannot help but be moved. Their training is rigorous beyond imagination. However, through this training, they cultivate an indomitable spirit and unwavering conviction. Seeing their resolute and heroic figures, filled with a spirit that doesn't yield to any hardship, I feel that the future of the Empire is truly secure.

— When I look back at my student life, I feel ashamed. I was too self-centered, lacking seriousness and depth. I resolve to reflect deeply on this and strive to become a true Japanese person.

— Life in the navy is extremely busy. There is hardly any time for personal matters. However, in the moments I can steal, I am reading books I brought with me, such as "Hagakure" (葉隱) and collections of poems by the Meiji Emperor. These books deeply resonate with my current state of mind. Especially the Emperor's poems, each word touches my heart.

— Today, we received special permission to go ashore. I walked around the streets of Kure (吳). The city was bustling with activity, truly reflecting its status as a naval port. Seeing the sailors walking proudly through the streets, I felt an indescribable sense of reliability and pride.

— A letter arrived from home. My mother worries about my health, but I am perfectly fine. Rather, my spirit is clearer and my body stronger than ever before. Please do not worry. I am determined to fulfill my duty as a soldier of the Empire.

— We finally received the order to deploy. The destination is South China. My heart leaps with excitement. The time has come to offer my life for the Emperor and the nation. I have no regrets. I only pray for the prosperity of the Empire and the well-being of my family.

— On board the ship, heading towards the South China Sea. The sea is calm, and the moon shines brightly. Looking at the moon, I think of my hometown and my family. However, I must not be sentimental. I am a soldier heading to the battlefield. I must focus only on fulfilling my duty.

＜103＞
— We arrived in South China. The heat is intense, and the environment is harsh. However, our morale is extremely high. We will overcome any difficulties and achieve our mission.

— We engaged in battle with the enemy. It was a fierce fight. Bullets flew past, and shells exploded nearby. It was my first experience of real combat, but I was surprisingly calm. I just single-mindedly focused on fighting the enemy. Many comrades fell. Their sacrifice will not be in vain. We will surely avenge them.

— In the intervals between battles, I think about various things. Why do humans fight? What is the meaning of life and death? However, such philosophical questions are luxuries on the battlefield. What is required of us now is simply to fight and win for the sake of the Empire. That is our sole mission.

— Another fierce battle today. We charged the enemy positions under heavy fire. I saw a comrade fall right next to me. Instantly, anger surged within me, and I charged forward, firing my gun relentlessly. We finally captured the enemy position. Victory was ours, but the cost was great.

＜104＞
— My body feels heavy. Perhaps I was wounded somewhere. But my spirit is still strong. As long as I have breath, I will continue to fight. For the Emperor, for the nation...

— Mother, Father, forgive my lack of filial piety in dying before you. Please live long and well. Brothers and sisters, take care of our parents. Friends, thank you for everything. Farewell. May the Empire of Japan prosper forever!

*Final Note: Ensign Ikezumi Gorō died heroically in this battle. His final moments were filled with fervent patriotism and loyalty to the Emperor. His noble spirit serves as a model for all Japanese youth.*

**Summary**

The article presents excerpts from the diary of Ikezumi Gorō, a Waseda University graduate turned Naval Ensign who died in combat in South China in 1940. The diary entries depict his transformation from a self-perceived complacent student to a devoted Imperial soldier, his admiration for the navy's rigor, his reflections on duty and sacrifice while reading patriotic texts like "Hagakure," and his experiences and thoughts during deployment and fierce battles in South China, culminating in his final patriotic words before death. From a colonial history perspective, this article is significant as it exemplifies the wartime propaganda prevalent in Japanese-controlled territories like Korea. Published in a Korean magazine, the glorification of a "Naichijin" (Mainland Japanese) student's sacrifice for the Emperor and Empire served to promote Japanese militarism, loyalty to the Emperor, and the ideal of self-sacrifice for the state, implicitly pressuring Korean youth to emulate this model and support the Japanese war effort.
