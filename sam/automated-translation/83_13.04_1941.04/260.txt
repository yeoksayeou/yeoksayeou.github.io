Article Title: 上海서 志願兵志望, 盛大한 送別에 新義州로 (Volunteering for the Army in Shanghai, Off to Sinuiju After a Grand Send-off)
Author: N/A
Article Type: 소식 (News)

In the past, Koreans in Shanghai (上海 朝鮮人) were interpreted in a distinct sense, but since the Incident (事變), they have become very filled with national consciousness (國民的 自覺). As perhaps one example of this fact recently, there is a youth who has gallantly volunteered for the army (勇躍陸軍志願兵).

He is Mr. Pang Obok (方五福君, 19), originally from P'yŏngbuk (平北) province in Korea, who has served for two years as a civilian employee (軍屬) in the Kikki Butai (吉岐部隊) unit currently in Shanghai, fulfilling his duties with sincerity and resolve. This time, with recommendations from the commander of the same Kikki Butai unit and the Chairman of the Korean Association (朝鮮人會長), Mr. Yi Kapnyŏng (李甲寧氏), he departed on the 9th of this month aboard the Ch'ŏngdo Maru (靑島丸) to take the examination in Sinŭiju (新義州).

On that day at the Shanghai wharf (上海埠頭), Chairman Yi and others, the Head of the Kyerim Youth Group (鷄林靑年團長), along with about 100 influential local Koreans (朝鮮人有志), as well as the dispatched official from the Government-General (總督府 坪井派遺官), Mr. Tsuboi, and Commander Kikki Butai along with about 50 officers and soldiers below him, saw him off. The aforementioned Mr. Pang (仝方君), embracing the firm resolve of repaying the nation as an imperial subject (皇民報國), thus embarked straightaway on his great journey (壯途). <145>

**Summary**

This news article reports on a 19-year-old Korean man from P'yŏngan Province, Pang Obok, who volunteered for the Japanese Army while working as a civilian employee for a Japanese military unit (Kikki Butai) in Shanghai. Recommended by the unit commander and the head of the local Korean Association, Yi Kapnyŏng, Pang departed Shanghai for Sinŭiju to take the entrance examination. He received a large send-off at the wharf attended by Japanese military personnel, a Government-General official (Tsuboi), and numerous members of the Shanghai Korean community, including association leaders and youth group members. The article frames his decision as an act of "national consciousness" and "imperial subject patriotism." For historians, this piece offers a glimpse into the promotion of Korean enlistment in the Japanese military during the colonial period, particularly among overseas Koreans, framing it as patriotic loyalty to the Empire. The notable presence of both Japanese officials and Korean community leaders at the send-off highlights the complex social dynamics and collaborative structures operating within the Korean diaspora under Japanese wartime mobilization.
