Collection of Lectures on "Korean Culture"

Our company has primarily focused on publications in the Korean script (朝鮮諺文) until now, but henceforth, from the standpoint of "Japan-Korea Cultural Exchange" (內鮮文化交流), we will also diligently publish materials in the Japanese language (邦文). As the very first of these, we are publishing this collection. We sincerely hope it will be favored by your readership.

**Summary**

This is an announcement from the Samch'ŏlli Company's publishing department, stating a shift in their publication strategy. While previously focused on materials in the Korean script (Hangul), they will now also publish works in Japanese, beginning with a collection of lectures titled "Korean Culture." This change is framed under the policy of "Japan-Korea Cultural Exchange" (Naeseon Munhwa Gyoryu / Naisen Bunka Kōryū). For historians, this brief notice is significant as it explicitly documents a publisher adapting its output to align with the intensifying assimilation policies of the late colonial period (specifically the *Naisen Ittai* or "Japan and Korea as One Body" policy), promoting Japanese language use even in materials discussing Korean culture.
