Sun Wen Park Construction by the Hands of People in China

The Shanghai Municipal Government (上海市政府) had been planning to erect a bronze statue of the late Sun Wen (孫文), the father of the Chinese Revolution. Following this, continuous monetary donations (淨財) were received from various quarters, leading to better results than expected. Thus, starting from the New Year, this major project has come into the hands of Japanese volunteers (邦人有志), which is indeed welcome news. Those who immediately stepped forward and took active roles include Mr. Hayashi (林氏), Nara Shigeho (奈良繁保), Kaga Mitsutake (加賀滿武), and others. Seeking to eternally commemorate the posthumous achievements (遺勳) of Sun Wen, who was a cornerstone of the Revival of Asia (興亞), these gentlemen recently visited Mayor Ch'en (陳市長) of the Municipal Government to cordially discuss (懇談) the plan. As a result, it was decided that a committee for the establishment of a park centered around the Sun Wen bronze statue would be formed before long. Therefore, the plan is to move the bronze statue, which was previously behind the Municipal Government building, to the front plaza and establish a large park centered around this statue, to be used as an entertainment and assembly area for all citizens. As this is a highly significant plan not only for Shanghai but for all of China (全支那), and even broadly in an East Asian (東洋的) sense, general anticipation (企待) is expected to be quite considerable. <117>

**Summary**

The article reports on plans by the Shanghai Municipal Government, supported by significant donations, to construct a park centered around a bronze statue of Sun Yat-sen (Sun Wen). Japanese volunteers, including individuals named Hayashi, Nara Shigeho, and Kaga Mitsutake, are taking a leading role in the project after discussions with Mayor Ch'en. The statue will be relocated to a front plaza, and the park is intended as a public space for entertainment and gatherings, envisioned as having significance beyond Shanghai, across China and East Asia. From a Korean colonial history perspective, the article is revealing in its portrayal of Japanese individuals ("邦人有志") spearheading a project honoring a Chinese figure (Sun Wen) in occupied Shanghai, framing it within the Japanese wartime ideology of "Revival of Asia" (興亞). It highlights the complex interplay of collaboration and Japanese dominance in occupied territories, using the symbolic figure of Sun Yat-sen for political purposes under the Japanese-backed collaborationist government in Shanghai. Historians might find the explicit mention of Japanese leadership and the co-option of Chinese nationalist symbols within the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" framework noteworthy.

在支那人 손으로 孫文公園 建設
上海市政府는 中國革命의 父 故 孫文의 동상을 세우려 계획하든 중 그 후 각 방면으로 續續淨財의 寄附를 얻어 豫期 以上의 好成績을 갖게 되었다. 그래 新春부터 이 대사업을 邦人有志의 손으로 갖게 되었으나 사실로 반가운 소식인 것이다. 이의 卽接 나서서 活躍하신 분은 林氏 이하 奈良繁保, 加賀滿武 등이여서 氏 등은 興亞의 礎石이시었든 孫文의 遺勳을 영원히 기념할려고 얼마 전 市政府 陳市長을 방문하고 계획을 懇談한 결과 멀지 않어 孫文銅像을 중심한 公園設置委員會를 설립하기로 하였다. 그래서 從來 市政府 뒤에 있든 銅像을 前廣場에 옴겨 이 동상을 중심한 대공원을 설치하여 전시민의 娛樂, 集會場으로 쓸 작정이라 한다. 이것은 上海 뿐만 아니라 全支那 아니 멀니 東洋的으로 매우 의미있는 계획임으로 일반의 企待는 좀처럼 클 것이 아닌가 한다.＜117＞
