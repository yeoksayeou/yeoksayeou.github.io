Company Notice

Regarding the article about the family of Min Yŏnghwi in the October issue of this magazine (本誌), we mistakenly wrote that Mr. Yi Chŏngjae seemed to be Min Yŏnghwi's son-in-law (婿郞), causing inconvenience to both Mr. Yi and Mr. Min. We were very sorry about this. We hereby correct this, stating that he is not the son-in-law, but rather a very distant relative (遠緣).

Samch'ŏlli Company <27>

**Summary**

This brief notice from the Samch'ŏlli Company corrects an error published in the magazine's previous issue (October 1938). The magazine had incorrectly identified Yi Chŏngjae as the son-in-law of Min Yŏnghwi in an article about the Min family. The correction clarifies that Yi is merely a distant relative and expresses apologies to both individuals. For historians, this notice is interesting as it demonstrates the magazine's responsiveness to factual errors concerning prominent figures and families during the colonial period. It underscores the importance of accurately portraying social relationships, particularly kinship ties, and shows the public nature of such corrections.

社告
本誌10월호 閔泳徽家의 기사중 李定宰씨를 閔泳徽씬 婿郞인 듯 誤記하여 李氏 閔氏에 모다 미안하엿슴니다. 婿郞은 아니고 아조-먼 遠緣이라하옵기에 是正하옵나이다.
