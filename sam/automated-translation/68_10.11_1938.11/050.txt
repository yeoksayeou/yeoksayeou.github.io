**Governor-General Minami's Daughter Wears Korean Clothes**

In front of some individuals who spout the astonishing words, "Get rid of the Korean language," and "Do away with Korean clothes," Governor-General Minami (南總督), on the visiting day of August 26th, delivered a sharp retort.
"Korean women's clothing is truly good. It's stylish, practical for activity, and convenient - moreover, being able to have a set made for 5 won and 50 chŏn, isn't it quite economical? I had my daughter wear Korean clothes too, and she really likes them. I think it would be good if men wore the national uniform (國民服) and women wore Korean clothes."

**Lieutenant General Hasegawa's Lament**

Lieutenant General Hasegawa (長谷川 中將), who served as the commander of the 3rd Fleet in China (支那), was transferred to become the Commander-in-Chief of the Yokosuka Naval Station (橫須賀鎭守府) amidst the Sino-Japanese Incident. Landing in Nagasaki (長崎) from Shanghai, he lamented:
"What I felt most keenly upon landing in Nagasaki is how terribly weak Japanese buildings are against air raids because they are made of wood. Considering future aerial bombing warfare (空爆戰), Japan must urgently implement air defense facilities (防空 設備) based on city planning (都市 計劃)."

**Mr. Kim Kyejo's Donation**

Mr. Kim Kyejo (金桂祚), a young businessman who has recently been much talked about for establishing a national policy company (國策 會社) worth several million won, has recently founded a company in the fuel sector and is actively engaged. According to news heard recently from his hometown of Kimhae, he has also made significant donations (義捐) to schools, public organizations (公共 團體), and the like in that region.

**Ms. Hŏ Yŏngsuk's "Benevolence" (仁)**

It became known that Ms. Hŏ Yŏngsuk (許英肅) took in a poor woman from her neighborhood who had no means to give birth, arranged for her hospitalization where she delivered a precious baby girl (貴童女), and even gave her 5 won before sending her off, earning gratitude from the vicinity. In any case, it seems we have discovered the art of benevolence (仁術) in this community (斯界) after a long time.

**Chiang Kai-shek's Son is a German Sergeant**

It is reported that Chiang Kai-shek (蔣介石)'s second son, Chiang Wei-kuo (蔣緯國), who was assigned to a mountain troops regiment (山岳兵 聯隊) of the German Wehrmacht (獨逸 國防軍) and undergoing intense training, was recently promoted to German Sergeant (獨逸 軍曹). Wei-kuo originally intended to study medicine and attended the Shanghai Medical Professional School before going to Germany and enlisting in the regiment. It is well known that his older brother, Ching-kuo (經國), attended the Moscow Communist University (모스꾸바 共産 大學) and is currently active after returning home.<49><49>

**Summary**

This article compiles several short news items from late 1938. It reports Governor-General Minami's surprising defense of Korean clothing for women despite assimilation pressures, Lieutenant General Hasegawa's concern about Japan's vulnerability to air raids, businessman Kim Kyejo's philanthropic activities, Ms. Hŏ Yŏngsuk's act of charity towards a poor woman in childbirth, and news about Chiang Kai-shek's sons studying and training abroad (one in Germany, one formerly in Moscow). From a historical perspective, the piece is interesting for revealing Governor-General Minami's seemingly contradictory stance on Korean attire amidst rising assimilation policies ("Naisen Ittai"). Hasegawa's comment reflects growing Japanese awareness of aerial warfare threats. The mentions of Kim Kyejo and Hŏ Yŏngsuk provide glimpses into the activities of Korean elites and acts of individual charity, while the news about Chiang's sons touches upon the complex international political landscape affecting East Asia.

談話室
南總督의 令女 朝鮮服을 입다
「조선말을 없애라」
「조선옷을 거두어라」
하고 놀라운 소리를 연발하는 일부 인간들을 앞에 안치고 지난 8월 26일 면회일에 南 총독은 鶴의 일격을 말했다.
「조선 여자의 의복은 참 조와요. 맵시도 있고 활동적이고 輕便하고 - 더구나 5원 50전이면 한 벌 하여 입을 수 있다니까 좀 경제적임니까. 나의 딸에게도 조선옷을 입었는데 아주 조와해요. 나는 남자는 국민복, 여자는 조선옷 - 이렇게 했으면 조흘 것 가태요」

長谷川 中將의 嘆聲

支那 제 3 함대 사령관을 지낸 長谷川 중장이 日支 사변 도중에 橫須賀鎭守府 사령장관으도 전임하였는데 상해로부터 長崎에 상륙하면서 개탄하기를
「내가 長崎에 상륙하면서 가장 통절히 늣긴 것은 일본 건물이 목조임으로 공습에는 몹시 약하구나 함이다. 장래의 空爆戰에 비최여 일본도 하로 급히 도시 계획에 의한 방공 설비를 하지 않으면 안된다고」

金桂祚氏의 義捐

요지간 수백 만원의 국책 회사를 만드러 소문이 많은 청년 실업가 金桂祚 氏는 최근에 연료 방면의 회사를 창립하야 크게 활약하고 있는데 요지음 그의 고향인 김해에서 들니는 소식에 의하면 그 지방의 학교, 공공 단체 등에도 많은 義捐을 하였다 한다.

許英肅氏의 「仁」

許英肅 여사가 그 동리 엇든 가난한 부인이 해산할 길이 없는 것을 대려다가 입원, 貴童女를 나케하고 그리고 돈 5원까지 주어서 보낸 일이 알여저서 近隣에서 감사한다고. 엇잿든 斯界에서 인술을 오래간 만에 발견하는군.

蔣介石 子息이 獨逸 軍曹

蔣介石의 차남 蔣緯國이 독일 국방군 산악병 연대에 배속되여 맹훈련을 받든 중 최근 독일 軍曹로 승진 되였다 한다. 緯國은 원래 의학에 뜻을 두어 상해 의학 전문 학교를 다니다가 독일 가서 연대에 입대한 것이다. 그 형 經國은 모스꾸바 共産 대학 다니다가 방금 귀국하여 활동 중인 것은 다 아는 일이지만.<49><49>
