**Body Text Translation:**
Gift to General Hua
						Du Fu
In Brocade City, music from silk strings and pipes bustles daily,
Half enters the river wind, half enters the clouds.
This melody surely ought only to exist in heaven;
In the human world, how many times can it be heard? <70>

**Summary**

This entry presents the famous classical Chinese poem "Gift to General Hua" (贈花卿) by the Tang dynasty poet Du Fu (杜甫). The poem describes the exquisite and seemingly celestial music heard at a banquet hosted by Hua Qing in Chengdu (锦城, Jincheng, "Brocade City"), marveling at its beauty and rarity in the mortal realm. The publication of this canonical Chinese poem in a Korean magazine during the Japanese colonial period (1934) highlights the enduring significance of classical Chinese literature in Korean culture. For historians, it might indicate a space for appreciating traditional East Asian heritage separate from Japanese colonial influence or contemporary Korean nationalist discourse, reflecting the complex cultural landscape of the time.
