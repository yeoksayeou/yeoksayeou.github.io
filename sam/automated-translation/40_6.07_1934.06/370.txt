Song of the Barbarian Reed Pipe
						Wang Changling

South of the city, the barbarians have already gathered;
In one night, how many layers deep is the siege?

Naturally, the golden reed pipe begins its tune,
Able to make spirits fly beyond the border pass.

Listening, it nears the border moon, full of sorrow;
Clear, it subtly blends into the sea wind.

Played three times as dawn breaks over the high tower,
The Hu people cover their tears and retreat.<74>

**Summary**

The article presents the classical Chinese poem "Song of the Barbarian Reed Pipe" (胡茄曲) by the Tang Dynasty poet Wang Changling (王昌齡). The poem depicts a besieged city on the frontier, where the mournful sound of a golden reed pipe (金笳) played through the night evokes such sorrow and homesickness among the besieging nomadic ("Hu") soldiers that they weep and withdraw by dawn. For historians, the publication of a classical Chinese poem in a popular Korean magazine like *Samch'ŏlli* during the Japanese colonial period is noteworthy. It might indicate a continued appreciation for and connection to the broader East Asian classical tradition, potentially serving as a subtle assertion of cultural identity distinct from Japanese colonial influence, or simply reflecting the magazine's diverse literary content catering to educated readers.

胡茄曲
						王昌齡
城南虜巳合
一夜幾重圍
自有金笳引
能令出塞飛
聽臨關月苦
淸入海風微
三奏高樓曉
胡人掩淚歸<74>
