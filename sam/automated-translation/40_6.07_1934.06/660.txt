**Body Text Translation:**
A Response Poem to Kim Puyong's Love Poem
						Author Unknown

Separated long,
Resentment deep.

Letters hard to send,
Thoughts wound the self.

Though I pour out my heart's blood,
I cannot appeal my sorrowful heart.<140>

The scenery is truly desolate,
My heart's threads grow ever more dreary.

I pity the moon hidden by the neighbor's plum blossoms,
And feel the garden bamboo proud against the frost.

Wishing to face the cold lamp, startled by the lonely pillow,
I gaze longingly at the empty chamber, dreaming of your beautiful face.

Each time I recall our separation, the regret pierces my bones,
Wishing to speak of past affairs, tears first fill my eyes.

Seeing you once, affection was immediate, sincere and deep,
Our fated connection across three lives, auspicious days and fine moments.

In Siao Sa's (簫史) flute song, he could summon the phoenix for the playing girl,
From Han Yŏn's (韓椽) sleeve, Ka Ssi's (賈氏) perfume was already stolen.

Our beautiful promise was just deepening, awaiting a hundred years bound together,
Our new love not yet fulfilled, how could we expect a sudden separation?<141>

Under the dawn moon and blue sky, who can bear to hear the wild geese calling their mates?
By the spring wind and green water, I am ashamed to see the mandarin ducks bathing side-by-side.

Parting is easy but meeting is hard, alas, human wishes cannot be fulfilled,
Good fate departs and bad fate arrives, I resent that Heaven's decree is not constant.

When walking, we held hands; when sitting, our necks entwined; in the past, our love surpassed glue and lacquer,
Forgetting food by day, abandoning sleep by night; now, sickness has entered my vital core (膏盲).

Oaths deep as seas and mountains are deeply engraved in my heart; though my insides break, my love cannot be broken,
Your flower-like face and moon-like grace are always before my eyes; though not mad, my heart is already frantic.

The Jade Shore (玉浦) is hard to cross, like the Weak Water (弱水) of three thousand leagues; grand feasts are already cut off from Chu Mok (周穆),
Mount Ch'i (雉岳) is distant, like the twelve peaks of Mount Wu (巫山); desolate dreams vainly trouble Ch'o Hyang (楚襄).

Though weak girls and boys are easily swayed by emotion, you could guard against the vulgar woman of Sangzhong (桑中),
Though gallant men may often be fickle, I emulate the faithful man waiting by the pillar (柱下).

Though stones rot and seas dry up, love is hard to forget; in this life, this world, I hope to play the zither of growing old together,
As long as heaven and earth endure, resentment is endless; what day, what hour, can we again be drunk with the joy of union?<142>

**Summary**

This classical Chinese-style poem, published anonymously in the Korean magazine *Samch'ŏlli* in 1934, is a response (和答) to a love poem apparently written by someone named Kim Puyong (金芙蓉). The speaker laments a painful separation from their beloved, recalling past intimacy and deep affection contrasted with current loneliness, sorrow, and lovesickness described as an incurable illness. Using numerous classical Chinese allusions (e.g., Xiao Shi, Han Shou, King Mu of Zhou, King Xiang of Chu, mandarin ducks, the man by the pillar), the poem expresses profound longing, despair over the separation, and unwavering vows of eternal love and fidelity despite the seemingly insurmountable obstacles.

For historians, this poem is interesting as an example of continued engagement with classical Chinese literary traditions and forms (Hanmun poetry) by Koreans during the colonial period, even for expressing intense personal emotions like romantic love and despair. Its publication in a popular magazine like *Samch'ŏlli* suggests a readership still appreciative of or educated in such styles. The anonymity and the theme of intense, possibly frustrated or forbidden, love might also hint at personal circumstances shaped by the social constraints or upheavals of the era, though the poem itself focuses purely on the universal themes of love and separation through a classical lens.

金芙蓉相思詩和答
						作者失名


別久
恨長

信難寄
思自傷

雖瀝腔血
莫訴哀膓<140>

景物正蕭索
心緖益凄凉

燐閤梅之隱月
感園竹之慠霜

慾對寒燈驚孤枕
悵望空閨夢艶粧

每念離居恨已透骨
欲言往事淚先滿眶

一見輒親情摯而誼篤
三生酬怨日吉兮辰良

簫史曲中, 能致奏女之鳳
韓椽袖裏, 已偸賈氏之香

佳約方深, 佇期百年之縋綣
新情未冶, 詎意一朝之分張<141>

曉月靑天, 誰忍聞, 呌侶之鴻雁
春風綠水, 我羞見, 對浴之鴦鵞

別時易而見時難, 嗟人願之莫遂
好緣去而惡綠來, 恨天定之靡常

行則接手, 坐則交頸, 昔也, 情逾膠漆
晝而忘餐, 夜而廢寢, 今焉 病入膏盲

海舊山盟, 深銘肺中, 膓雖斷而 情難斷
花容月態, 長在眼裏, 人非狂而 心已狂

玉浦難越, 如弱水三千, 盛宴, 已絶於周穆
雉岳遠隔, 若巫山十二, 荒夢, 徒惱於楚襄

軟弱兒女, 雖易牽情, 君能戒期桑中之鄙婦
豪宕丈夫, 或多輕信, 我則效守柱下之貞郞

石爛海枯, 情難忘, 此生此世, 期欲奏偕老之瑟
天長地久, 恨無盡, 何日何時, 能復醉合歡之觸<142>
