Sukhui: "Look here. There really are some terrible men in the world. Today's newspaper (新聞) said there was a man who traded his wife for a pack of cigarettes for one night."
Her Husband: "Tsk, what a useless bum!"
Sukhui: "Oh, good! Please love me just like that."
Her Husband: "Well, if it were liquor, maybe, but to trade for measly cigarettes..."
Sukhui: "...?!"<90>

**Summary**

This short anecdote presents a conversation between a wife, Sukhui, and her husband. Sukhui expresses shock at a newspaper story about a man trading his wife for cigarettes and asks her husband to show her unwavering love. The husband condemns the man in the story but then implies he might consider trading his wife for alcohol, just not something as cheap as cigarettes, leaving Sukhui speechless. From a historical perspective, the piece offers a glimpse into casual humor and perhaps underlying societal attitudes towards women and marriage in 1930s Korea. The mention of a man 'trading' his wife, even as a shocking news item or joke premise, might reflect anxieties about economic hardship or deeply ingrained patriarchal norms, making it potentially interesting for social historians.
