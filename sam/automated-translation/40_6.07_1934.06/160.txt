A. According to the words of the famous sharp-tongued Mr. Ch'a Sangch'an (車相瓚) of our time, Mr. Cho Mansik (曹晩植) wears a "Chosŏn frock coat (朝鮮후록코-드)."

B. Did Chosŏn also have frock coats (후록코-드)?

A. No. This gentleman (兩班) wears such a shortened turumagi (두루막이), it's as if he cut it in two, wears only the top part, and forgot the bottom part, so it doesn't even reach his shins—the chest part is awfully thick material. And then, for his name card (名啣), he uses Chosŏn white paper (朝鮮白紙) cut out, you see.

B. Then was that name card (名啣) written with a brush?

A. No. It is printed with movable type (活字). Does this mean this is the only aspect where he hasn't rejected modern civilization? Like Tolstoy.

B. That "Chosŏn Gandhi (조선깐디)" is also a peculiar person (別人).

A. Speaking of which, did you hear that Ms. Hŏ Yŏngsuk (許英肅 女史), after her beloved child died (愛兒를 죽이고), performed a kut (굿), saying a ghost (鬼神) was involved [*word missing/unclear*]?

B. Surely she didn't do it saying a ghost (鬼神) was possessing [someone/something]. She probably did it for the soul (靈魂) to depart peacefully. Anyway, she certainly did something that firmly places her in a corner of the "peculiar people" (別人) category.<46>

**Summary**

This short conversational piece discusses two contemporary figures considered eccentric ("Peculiar People"). First, Cho Mansik, nicknamed the "Chosŏn Gandhi," is described by Ch'a Sangch'an as wearing unusually short traditional coats (turumagi), likened humorously to frock coats, and using simple hand-cut traditional paper for his name cards, albeit printed with modern type. Second, Hŏ Yŏngsuk is mentioned for reportedly performing a shamanistic ritual (kut) after the death of her child, allegedly related to spirit possession, though the speaker clarifies it was likely for the child's soul. The article highlights Cho Mansik's blend of traditionalism and modernity and gossips about Hŏ Yŏngsuk's controversial response to grief.

For historians, this article offers insight into contemporary perceptions and characterizations of prominent nationalist figures like Cho Mansik ("Chosŏn Gandhi") during the colonial period, noting his distinctive attire and practices that blended tradition with aspects of modernity. It also reveals social attitudes towards traditional Korean customs like the turumagi and shamanistic rituals (kut) versus modern influences (printed cards, comparisons to Tolstoy), and provides a glimpse into the social commentary and gossip surrounding public figures like Hŏ Yŏngsuk in 1930s Korea.
