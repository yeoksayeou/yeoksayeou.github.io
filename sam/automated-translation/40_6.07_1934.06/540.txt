(Continued from previous issue) As you know, Confucianism (儒學) is a principle of applying nature, thus direct use of nature is considered the act of barbarians or beasts (夷狄禽獸) in Confucianism, and it prides itself on the idea that only humans apply nature.
To give one or two examples of this application of nature, 5,000 years ago, "When Bao Xi (包犧氏) ruled the world, he looked up and observed the phenomena in the heavens, looked down and observed the patterns on the earth, observed the markings of birds and beasts, and the suitability of the land. He took things close at hand from his own body and things far away from other objects. Thereupon, he first drew the eight trigrams to communicate the virtue of the divine spirits and to classify the conditions of all things." (Yi Jing, Xici Xia)
"He made knotted cords and used them as nets for hunting and fishing, likely taking this from the trigram Li (離)." (Ibid.)
"After Bao Xi died, Shennong (神農氏) arose. He cut wood to make plows and bent wood to make plowshares. With the benefits of plowing and weeding, he taught the world, likely taking this from the trigram Yi (益)." (Ibid.)
"He held markets at midday, attracting the people of the world and gathering the goods of the world. They traded and then dispersed, each getting what they needed, likely taking this from the trigram Shi Ke (噬嗑)." (Ibid.)
In the hexagram Bi (比 - Water over Earth) of the Yi Jing, it says, "Water on the earth is Bi. The ancient kings, based on this, established myriad states and fostered kinship among the feudal lords." From this, the equality of humans was understood, but kinship (親) was specifically pointed out.
In the hexagram Tong Ren (同人 - Fire under Heaven) of the Yi Jing, it says, "Heaven and fire together form Tong Ren. The noble person, based on this, distinguishes things by their categories and groups (類族)." This means that one must discern how all things are distributed and propagated according to their mutual categories and groups. In other words, it clarifies the principle that all things grow together without hindering each other (萬物이 並育 而不相悖). For example, flying creatures cannot be categorized with running creatures, and swimming creatures cannot be categorized with plants. Therefore, since humans are categorized with humans (空谷之中 見似人者而喜 (莊子) - "In an empty valley, seeing someone who looks like a person brings joy" (Zhuangzi)), humans taking only what is suitable for themselves from nature is precisely the application of nature. (天道普圓 人道選圓 (鄙稿) - "The way of Heaven is universally round; the way of Man is selectively round" (My humble writing)). Thus, flying, running, swimming, and planted things also each take only what is suitable for themselves, flowing according to the truth of growing together without hindering each other.<108>
In the hexagram Sun (損 - Lake under Mountain) of the Yi Jing, it says, "A lake beneath a mountain is Sun. The noble person, based on this, restrains anger and checks desires (懲憤窒慾)." This means that what is high suffers the loss (損) of collapse, and what is concave suffers the loss (損) of being filled.
It is a warning that if humans are extremely adept at restraining anger and checking desires, they will avoid the mutual loss between high and low. In the hexagram Song (訟 - Water under Heaven) of the Yi Jing, it says, "Heaven and water moving contrary to each other is Song. The noble person, based on this, plans affairs from beginning to end." As Mencius said, "All things are complete within me (萬物이 皆備吾一身)," this universe is entirely commentary for me. Therefore, the self is a part of the universe.

Qian (乾) is the father! Kun (坤) is the mother! Heaven and Earth are the parents of all things. The Yi Jing says, "Settle the land and be devotedly benevolent (安土하야, 敦手仁이라), therefore one can love (故로 能愛하나니라)." Physicists seem to call this 'gravity' (引力), while philosophers call it 'affinity' (親和力). The Tuan commentary on Qian in the Yi Jing says, "In the changes of the Way of Qian, each corrects its nature and destiny (各正性命). Preserving harmony with the Great Harmony (保合太和), thus it is advantageous and correct (乃利貞)." The Wenyan commentary on the same says, "The noble person's embodiment of benevolence (體仁) is sufficient to lead people; beautiful gatherings (嘉會) are sufficient to accord with propriety (禮); benefiting things (利物) is sufficient to harmonize with righteousness (義); correctness and firmness (貞固) are sufficient to manage affairs." The Xici Shang commentary says, "The establishment of the way involves one yin and one yang (一陰一陽之設道). Continuing it is goodness (善); completing it is nature (性). The benevolent see it and call it benevolence (仁); the wise see it and call it wisdom (知). The common people use it daily without knowing (百姓은 日用而不知). Therefore, the Way of the noble person is rare (故로 君子之道-鮮矣니라)." The Zhou Li, Shizongbo section, says, "Through the rites of hospitality, foster kinship with the myriad states (以賓禮, 親萬邦)." The Yue Ji says, "Unite father and son, ruler and minister, attach and foster kinship with the myriad people (合父子君臣附親萬民)." The Yao Dian says, "Bring harmony to the nine degrees of kinship (以親九族)." The Shun Dian says, "The Emperor said, 'Qi, the people are not harmonious, the five relationships are not followed. You shall be the Minister of Instruction (司徒). Respectfully teach the five precepts (敬數五敎).'" In the Dadai Liji, Zhuyan chapter, Confucius answered Zengzi's question, saying, "What I tell you of the Way is that by which virtue is illuminated (吾語汝道者, 所以明德也)." He also said, "When superiors cherish inferiors like their own heart and bowels (腹心), then inferiors cherish superiors like a child seeing its loving mother (保子之見慈母也). Only when superiors and inferiors cherish each other like this will they follow when united and act when implemented (上下相親如此然後, 合則從, 施則行)." The Analects says, "Dwelling in benevolence is beautiful (里仁爲美). Choosing not to dwell in benevolence, how can one attain wisdom (擇不處仁, 唇得知)?" "People's need for benevolence is greater than for water and fire. I have seen people die tread-ing on water and fire, but I have never seen anyone die treading on benevolence (民之於仁, 甚於水火, 水火, 吾見蹈而死者矣, 未見蹈仁而死者也)." "Is there anyone who can commit their strength to benevolence for a single day? I have not seen anyone whose strength is insufficient (有能一日川其力於仁矣乎? 我未見其力不足者)." "Is benevolence far away? If I desire benevolence, then benevolence arrives (仁遠乎哉? 我欲仁, 斯仁至矣)." Cheng Mingdao's (程明道) "Essay on Recognizing Benevolence" (識仁篇) states, "Scholars must first recognize benevolence. Benevolence is being undifferentiatedly one body with all things. Righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness are all benevolence (學者須先識仁, 仁者, 渾然與物同體, 義禮智信皆仁也)." Wang Yangming (王陽明) said, "Heaven, Earth, and all things are one body (天地萬物, 皆爲一體)." The Confucian concept of benevolent love (仁愛說) is the name given after embodying the gravitational pull of Heaven and Earth (the affinity of the divine). It simultaneously recognizes that all things are descendants of Father Qian and Mother Kun, creating a single family of Heaven and Earth (universal family principle - 宇宙一家主義), strictly distinguishes the categorical boundaries (類族分界) of all things, applies nature most appropriately, elevates the human-centered principle (人格主義) where humanity becomes the spiritual head among all things, establishes the system of interaction between Heaven and humans, makes those with intelligence, wisdom, and great virtue the prime sons of Heaven (天子 - Son of Heaven) (ordinary people being the multitude of sons), and has them rule the world. Isn't it clear that human peace was its ideal from the beginning? In this way, the ethical view based on benevolent love, aiming for the peace of humanity as one family under Heaven, showed its potential from the outset. It is worth reconsidering with open eyes that the amalgamation of hundreds of ethnic groups totaling 400 million people into a great furnace was not accidental.
The Western style! From the beginning, it's solely about power (惟權)! Solely about profit (惟利)! Individualism! Discordant and difficult to unite (落落難合). As mentioned above, isn't the small red peninsula, smaller than a single Chinese province, filled with over ten countries that have contended for profit for thousands of years, never satisfied without plundering (交爭利, 不奪不猒)? Since Socrates and Aristotle, the utilitarianism (功利) labored over by countless philosophers <109> has certainly contributed somewhat to material things and techniques, but it has made not the slightest contribution to so-called human peace, that is, world peace. Far from contributing, the advancement of knowledge focused on contending for profit has, unfortunately, only been sufficient to shatter human peace. Only recently, in the last few decades, theories of spirit-body unity, practicalism, and ethicalism, which others have been experimenting with for thousands of years, seem to have emerged and are being touted as golden rules, but regarding the theory of knowledge and action (知行論), the East has had a complete treasure trove since Confucius.

The Way of the Great Learning (大學之道) lies "in illuminating luminous virtue (在明明德), in fostering kinship with the people (在親民), and in resting in the highest good (在止於至善)." "Those ancients who wished to illuminate luminous virtue throughout the world first ordered their states (先治其國). Wishing to order their states, they first regulated their families (先齊其家). Wishing to regulate their families, they first cultivated their persons (先修其身). Wishing to cultivate their persons, they first rectified their hearts (先正其心). Wishing to rectify their hearts, they first made their intentions sincere (先誠其意). Wishing to make their intentions sincere, they first extended their knowledge (先致其知). The extension of knowledge lies in the investigation of things (致知는, 在格物이니라)." And again, "When things are investigated, knowledge is extended (物格而所에, 知至). When knowledge is extended, intentions become sincere (至至而后에 志誠). When intentions are sincere, hearts are rectified (志誠而后에 心正). When hearts are rectified, persons are cultivated (心正而后에 身修). When persons are cultivated, families are regulated (身修而后에 家齊). When families are regulated, states are ordered (家齊而后에, 國治). When states are ordered, the world is at peace (國治而后에 天下平)." It also says, "From the Son of Heaven down to the common people, all must consider the cultivation of the person the root (自天子至於庶人히, 壹是皆以修身爲本이니라)." To strictly teach the sequence of progress, based on this absolute egalitarian human-centered principle (人本主義), it states, "For the root to be in disorder and the branches to be ordered is impossible. For that which should be treated thickly to be treated thinly, and that which should be treated thinly to be treated thickly, has never been (其本이 亂而末治者-否矣며, 其所厚者에 薄이오, 而其所薄者에 厚하리 未之有也-니라)." The interpretation of this investigation of things and extension of knowledge (格致) in the Great Learning is not without differing views even among Confucians, but my interpretation inevitably concludes with investigating one thing, extending one piece of knowledge (innate knowledge - 良知), making one intention sincere, rectifying one heart, and cultivating one's person—it is the content of the unity of knowledge and action (知行合一). In my humble work, "New Lectures on the Great Learning" (鄙著新大學講義), I explained it thus: "'Luminous virtue' (明德子) is innate knowledge (良知), fundamental benevolence (素仁), encompassing righteousness (義). Its nature is like a bright mirror reflecting things (認識만은 鏡體喩外에 別노 解할 것 - Understanding itself requires explanation beyond the mirror metaphor). It responds to things without falsehood, reflecting them as they appear. Reflection leads to connection (通), connection leads to kinship (親). Obscuration leads to blockage (塞), blockage leads to estrangement (疏). Kinship/estrangement, connection/blockage are indicators of benevolence or lack thereof. Thus, possessing luminous virtue inherently means its application cannot fail to foster kinship. 'People' (民) signifies the multitude, representing humans and things. 'Highest good' (至善) is the place of the rectified heart. When this heart investigates things and fully achieves sincerity and rectification, the cultivation of the person (修身) begins. Once the cultivation of the person begins, regulating the family, ordering the state, and bringing peace to the world (齊治平) follow. Therefore, the rectified heart is the substance of the highest good, its very center (中)." Also, explaining the investigation of things and extension of knowledge: "(Beginning omitted - original text) Here is a father. When acting towards his son with the way of loving-kindness (慈愛), the son is the 'thing' (物). Here is a son. When acting towards his father with the way of filial piety and support (奉養), the father is the 'thing'. However, the fundamental meaning of investigating things and extending knowledge in the Great Learning requires understanding the unity of knowledge and action in its application and principles. Otherwise, it becomes fragmented and diffuse, and the reality of sincere intention cannot be seen. For example, a father towards his son, pitying his foolishness, makes him study; pitying his crudeness, makes him practice propriety (禮). Pitying both foolishness and crudeness arises from feelings within loving-kindness. Knowing this is pity, he thus makes him study books and practice propriety. Making him study and practice propriety means the intention based on this knowledge is sincere. This intention being sincere, the heart is rectified. This heart being rectified, the person is cultivated. This person being cultivated, only then is the father's way of loving-kindness accomplished. A son towards his father, fearing he might disobey commands, practices nourishing his will (養志); fearing he might not be anticipating needs, practices settling his needs morning and evening (定省). Fearing disobedience or lack of anticipation arises from feelings within filial piety and support. Knowing this is fear, he thus practices nourishing the will and settling needs. Practicing nourishing the will and settling needs means the intention based on this knowledge is sincere. This intention being sincere, the heart is rectified. This heart being rectified, the person is cultivated. This person being cultivated, only then is the son's way of filial piety (孝) accomplished.<110> However, if one extends knowledge but fails to act, this is laziness leading to self-abandonment (暴棄). Therefore, the commentary says, 'Like hating a bad smell, like loving a beautiful color (如惡之臭, 如好好色).' This analogy refers precisely to the effort in knowledge and action. If one is sincere like loving a beautiful color and corrects faults like hating a bad smell, then the intention will surely be sincere without self-deception. This is called the unity of knowledge and action (知行合一). (End omitted - original text)." Mencius's theory of 'innate knowledge and innate ability' (良知良能), Wang Yangming's saying, "Knowledge is the beginning of action; action is the completion of knowledge (知者行之始也, 行者知之成也)," and Zhu Xi's (朱子) statement, "It need not be sought outside the daily use and constant ethical relations of the people's lives (不待求之民生日用彛倫之外也)"—these innumerable examples of realism are the indispensable core of Confucianism's human-centered principle. Furthermore, Confucius's principle of perfecting character is the representative principle of Confucianism, called the great synthesis (集大成) of the sages (群聖). His making benevolence (仁) the highest total virtue of human life and speaking of it as the fundamental principle of everything encompasses and names the full meaning of Heaven and Earth's original nature (陸象山이 曰 『仁自夫子發之』 - Lu Xiangshan said, 'Benevolence originated from the Master'). Indeed, this character '仁' embodies and expresses without reservation the great virtue by which Heaven and Earth generate the myriad things. This benevolence is truly the highest total virtue that integrates and penetrates all human virtues (吾道一以貫之 - My way is one that penetrates all). This is the spiritual point of his Kingly Way politics (王道政治). The realization of peace throughout the world by unifying the Central Plains was truly not accidental, as repeatedly stated above. The fact that its foundational thought is absolute ethicalism is the unique strength of this teaching and this way, I say again.

The Kingly Way (王道) was, from the beginning, social communism (社會共産主義). The difference from Karl Marx's (갈맑스) social communism lies in the differing historical environments and origins. Also, one is a social ideology refined from individualism, while the other is a socialism developed from familism from the outset. In the hexagram Tong Ren (同人), the first line (初九) says, "Going out the gate with others (出門同人), who can blame you (又 誰咎也-리오)?" The second line (九二) says, "Associating with people only within the clan (同人于宗) is regrettable (吝토다)." Thus, refined from familism, it progressed to the state and then to the world, ultimately idealizing a Great Harmony (大同) world of social communism where "people do not only cherish their own parents, nor only cherish their own children (親不獨其親이오, 子不獨其子-오); the old have a place to belong (老有所歸), the young have nourishment (幼有所養); wealth, though one may dislike its lack for oneself, is not hoarded personally (貨는 惡無于已언정, 不藏乎身하고); effort, though one may dislike not exerting it oneself, is not applied for personal gain (力은 惡其不出於已언정 不施之於人也) (rest omitted - original text)." Another major difference is that one is based on absolute ethics and morality (絶對倫理, 道德主義), while the other is based on absolute profit-seeking and power-seeking (絶對惟利, 惟權主義). Being profit- and power-seeking, the method can only be struggle (鬪爭); being ethical and moral, it cannot but rely on benevolent governance (仁政). As for other details, one, being an ancient system, is comparatively simple, while the other, being modern, is comparatively detailed. However, detail versus simplicity may not pose any conflict. Only the point of making the opportunities for production and distribution, the elements of livelihood, public comes from the same spirit. Yet, differences arise in the methods of utilizing these opportunities. One idealizes equality between superiors and inferiors by limiting innate human abilities (天賦人能) (current Soviet policy - 現 소베트政策), while the other leaves the superiority or inferiority of human abilities to freedom, only making the opportunities for livelihood public (惟一生活의 機會만을, 公共케 하는 것이엇음니다) (Kingly Way politics - 王道政治).

I am not an economist, nor a political or legal scholar, nor a philosopher. Therefore, I have no intention of suddenly converting to Karl Marx, nor do I sympathize with Bernstein's (베룬스타인) ideology.<111> Of course not. However, seeing the current Western-style political system excluding the masses so much, I felt it was too regrettable to leave our Eastern Kingly Way political thought buried in old waste paper. This is my confession for having mentioned the so-called "Study of the Kingly Way" (王道硏究). Isn't it a fact in the East that everyone considers the Kingly Way the Way of the Sages? Even the political authorities who currently view ideologies as dangerous not only approve of Confucian classics like the Four Books and Three Classics (四書三經) as textbooks but also praise them as the politics of sages and worthies, do they not? The Kingly Way that everyone wants to study is precisely this way of sages and worthies, and the meaning was to try and interpret the words of the Four Books and Three Classics in a modern way. Doesn't the commentary say, "Where there are people, there is land (有人이면 玆有士-오); where there is land, there is wealth (有士면 玆有財오); where there is wealth, there is use (有財면, 玆有用이니라)"? If there is land, but the native people have no land to cultivate for food and are scattering in all directions with their old and young (將老幼携하고 散而之四方), then that saying "Where there are people, there is land" is also utter nonsense. However, the Book of Odes, Zhou Song section, says, "Give us wheat and barley (貽我來牟), Heaven commands all to be nourished (帝命率育). Let there be no boundaries or limits for you (無此疆爾界)." This is historical evidence for "people having land." The Book of Odes, Beishan section, says, "Under the whole heaven, there is no land that is not the king's (普天之下에 莫非王土)." This refers to the historical trace of land being nationalized after progressing from tribal organization to state structure.

In ancient times, agriculture was the primary industry, so ensuring the stability of the people's livelihood naturally meant that determining the distribution of land was the first and greatest issue. So, what form did the giving and receiving between the government and the people take at that time? The government was the landowner, and the people were the cultivators. According to what Mencius transmitted, the distribution methods were: "The Xia dynasty (夏禹氏) took fifty [mu] and levied tribute (貢); the Yin people (殷人) took seventy [mu] and used the mutual aid system (助); the Zhou people (周人) took one hundred mu and used the thorough sharing system (徹)."
One. Gong (貢): This means the people paid a portion of their harvest from cultivation to the government. The phrase "calculating the average over several years to make it constant (較數歲之中以爲常)" suggests it was similar to our current fixed rent (賭租). The exact amount is unclear, but tradition says one-tenth (十分一). The Tribute of Yu (禹貢) description: "Within 100 li, the tax is paid in whole stalks; within 200 li, in ears; within 300 li, in straw with grain; within 400 li, in grain in the husk; within 500 li, in cleaned rice" might refer to this.
Two. Zhu (助): Mencius explained the character zhu (助) as "borrowing" (藉). He described the zhu system: "A square li is divided by paths like the character 'well' (井). A well [-field] has nine hundred mu. The central plot is the public field (公田). Eight families each have a private hundred mu and jointly cultivate the public field (八家皆私百畝, 同養公田)." The public field refers to the land cultivated jointly by the eight families and paid to the government, while the 800 mu cultivated by the eight families for themselves are called private fields (私田). The Xia Xiao Zheng says, "First serve the public field (初服于公田)." The Book of Odes, Datian section, says, "Rain on our public field, then extend to our private fields (雨我公田, 遂及我私)." In modern terms, the eight families paid their taxes through labor.
Three. Che (徹): The Book of Odes, Gong Liu section, says, "Thoroughly divide the fields for grain (徹田爲糧)." It also says, "King Wen governed Qi, cultivators [paid] one-ninth (文王治岐畊者九一)." Whether this refers to a one-ninth tax is unclear, but the Analects records: "Duke Ai asked You Ruo, 'The year is one of famine, and the revenues are insufficient. What is to be done?' You Ruo replied, 'Why not simply use the che system?' The Duke said, 'With two[-tenths], I still find it insufficient. How could I manage with the che system?'" Based on this, the one-ninth (九一) seems plausible.
Regarding these three types, discussions ancient and modern have been quite varied, and there's no need to settle them here. However, based on Mencius's conclusive discussion regarding Duke Wen of Teng, which favors the Zhu (助) method, I believe the Well-Field System (井田法) was maintained in the ancient East for a long time.<112>
However, this one-eleventh (十一) or one-ninth (九一) tax* was collected after the state granted land (據田) to the people, whereas today's taxes are collected without granting land. One must discern this fundamental difference in nature.

Nineteen

Therefore, the privatization of land must undoubtedly be a corrupt practice that continued after the Kingly Rule (王政) degenerated into Hegemonic Rule (覇政). In our Joseon (朝鮮) too, the legend of the well-field system (井田傳說) is reflected in history. The commentary in *Eocheonje* (御天題小註 - *unverified title*) says, "Goryeo Taejo (高麗太祖) established the land system, distributing land to officials and subjects. Officials were given land according to rank, which was reclaimed upon death or commission of a crime. Later, the door to land consolidation opened, and the law of land tenure gradually weakened (其後兼倂之門一開, 而據田之法, 漸隨弛)." Even in the Yi Dynasty (李朝), until recently, didn't the various designations like post station land (驛屯), government land (官屯), and military land (軍田) clearly show the original character of state land ownership (土地國有)? It is said to be similar overseas as well. Besides this, direct state management of major industries (大産*) has many precedents, implemented not just by the Kingly Way but also by Hegemonic Rule, and isn't this also frequently done in modern Western-style politics?
In essence, ensuring the people's livelihood stability cannot but be an absolute issue (畧-원문 - Abbreviated - original text). Therefore, I am not making proposals about what should be done about this, nor is this a declaration for a movement. I merely wish to research* (講究*) and clarify the principles mentioned in the Four Books and Three Classics, and to revitalize Eastern Kingly Way politics in a modern form to make a great contribution to world peace. This is my sole desire.

**Summary**

The author, Seol Tae-hŭi, argues for the superiority of traditional East Asian Confucian political thought, specifically the "Kingly Way" (王道), over modern Western ideologies like individualism, capitalism, and even Marxism. He contrasts Confucianism's emphasis on ethics (仁, benevolence), human-centeredness (人本主義), the unity of knowledge and action (知行合一), and familism-based social harmony (leading to a form of "social communism") with what he perceives as the West's focus on power (惟權) and profit (惟利), leading to conflict. He traces the roots of the Kingly Way to ancient Chinese texts like the Yi Jing and advocates for reviving these principles, including land reform ideas like the well-field system (井田法), as a path towards genuine human and world peace, suggesting it offers a more holistic and ethical framework than Western models. From a colonial history perspective, the article is significant as it represents an intellectual's attempt to find indigenous Korean/East Asian solutions to contemporary problems, implicitly critiquing both Western modernity and potentially the imposed Japanese colonial order by advocating for a return to idealized Confucian principles of governance and social organization. It reflects a search for cultural identity and an alternative path during a period of intense external pressure.

易水地比象에 曰 「地上有水-比니 先王이 以하야 建萬國하고 親諸侯하니라」함을 본바다서 人間의 平等을 諦하얏으되 반듯이 親을 指摘하얏음니다.
易大火同人象에 曰 「天與火同人이니 君子-以하야 類族으로 辨物하나니라」 하얏으니 이 난 萬物이 互相類族으로 分佈蕃殖함을 辨別하여야 된나는 것이니 즉 萬物이 並育 而不相悖하는 理法을 明示한 것이외다. 말하자면 飛는 走와 類族될 수 없고 潛이 赤是 植과 類族이 딀수 없다는 것과 가튼 것이외다. 그럼으로 人은 人과 類族임으로 (空谷之中 見似人者而喜 (莊子) 人은 自然 中에서 人自己에게 適合한 것만 取하는 것이 즉 自然適用임니다. (天道普圓 人道選圓 (鄙稿)) 이럼으로 飛走潛植이 亦 各自己에게 適合한 것만 取하야 並育不相悖의 眞理대로 흐르(流)게 함이외다.<108>
易山澤損象에 曰 『山下有澤이, 損이니, 君子-以하야, 懲憤窒慾이니라』. 하얏으니, 이는 高한 者-崩壞하는, 損이 잇고, 凹한 者-塡充되는 損이 잇다는 것이외다.
人이 克히 懲憤窒慾을 잘하면, 高, 凹-互相損을 免하리라는 警戒임니다. 易天水訟象에 曰 『天與水-違行이 訟이니, 君子-以하야, 謀事終始하나니라』. 하얏으니, 孟子所謂 『萬物이 皆備吾一身』. 이란 말과 가티, 이 宇宙는 皆我註脚임니다. 그럼으로, 自我는 즉 宇宙의 一分임니다.

乾爲父! 坤爲母! 天地는 즉 萬物의 父母임니다. 易에 「安土하야, 敦手仁이라, 故로 能愛하나니라』. 하얏으니, 物理學者는, 이것을 『引力』이라고 하는 모양이오, 哲學者는 이것을 『親和力』이라고 함니다. 易乾彖에 曰 『乾道變化에 各正性命하나니, 保合太和하야, 乃利貞하니라』. 하고, 仝文言에 曰 『君子-體仁이 足以長人이오, 嘉會-足以合禮며, 利物이 足以和義며, 貞固-足以幹事니』. 하얏고, 仝繫辭上에 曰 『一陰一陽之設道-니, 繼之者-善也-오, 成之者-性也-라. 仁者-見之에 謂之仁하며, 智者-見之에 設之知-오, 百姓은 日用而不知라, 故로 君子之道-鮮矣니라』. 하얏나니다. 周禮士宗伯에 曰 『以賓禮, 親萬邦』. 樂紀에 曰 『合父子君臣附親萬民』 堯典에 曰 以親九族』. 舜典에 曰 『帝日契, 百姓不親, 五品이 不遜, 汝作司徒, 敬數五敎』. 大戴禮主言에 孔子答曾子問曰 吾語汝道者, 所以明德也』. 又曰 『上之親下也, 如腹心則, 下之親上也, 如保子之見慈母也. 上下相親如此然後, 合則從, 施則行』. 論語에 曰 『里仁爲美. 『擇不處仁, 唇得知』. 『民之於仁, 甚於水火, 水火, 吾見蹈而死者矣, 未見蹈仁而死者也』. 『有能一日川其力於仁矣乎? 我未見其力不足者』. 『仁遠乎哉? 我欲仁, 斯仁至矣』. 라 하얏고, 程明道의 識仁篇에 曰 『學者須先識仁, 仁者, 渾然與物同體, 義禮智信皆仁也』 라 하고, 王陽明이 曰 『天地萬物, 皆爲一體』. 라 하얏나니다. 儒學上仁愛說은, 곳 天地의 引力 (神의 親和力)을 體得한 命名이오. 萬物은 곳 乾父坤母의 子孫이라 諦認하는 同時에, 天地로 一丈家를 (宇宙一家主義) 만들어 노코, 萬物의 類族分界를, 嚴別하야, 自然의 適用을, 가장 適切하게 하야, 人類가 萬物中靈長되는 人格主義를 高調하고, 天人相與의 系統을 依然하게 立하야, 聰明睿知大德者로써, 天의 元子(一般人生은 衆子)로 하야, 天子라 하고 天上에 王케 하얏으니, 人類平和는, 最初부터 그 理想임이 明白하지 안한가요? 이러하게, 仁愛를 基한 倫理觀念이, 天下一家的 人類平和를 理想함이, 最初부터 可能性을 보이게 되엇음니다. 4億萬의 數百 國民族을, 大冶爐의 陶식힌 것이, 偶然한 일이 안인 것을, 새삼스러이 눈뜨고 생각해 볼 일임니다.
歐美式! 最初부터 惟權! 惟利! 個人主義! 落落難合임니다. 우에도 말햇거니와, 中國의 一省面積도 못되는 빨간半島가, 十數國이, 數千年을 두고, 交爭利, 不奪不猒이 안임니까? 소크라데스, 아리스도텔네스 以來 數없는 哲學者들의 腐心한 功利는,<109> 物質, 伎術에 만은, 所助가 없지 안엇지마는, 所謂人類平和 즉 世界平和에는, 毫末의 貢獻이 없엇음니다. 없기는 姑舍是하고, 交爭利的 知識助進은, 도리여 不幸스러이, 人類平和를 缺裂케 함에만 足할 뿐이엇음니다. 요새 와서야, 數十年來에 와서야, 남이 數千年前부터 試鍊해오던 靈, 肉一致論 實踐主義, 倫理主義論덜이, 생겨나서 金科玉條로 떠드는 모양이지마는, 그 知行論에 대해서도, 東洋은 孔子로부터 完成된 寶典이 잇음니다.

大學之道는 『在明明德하며, 在親民하며, 在止於至善이니라』. 하고 『古之欲明明德於天下者는, 先治其國하고, 欲治其國者는, 先齊其家하고, 欲齊其家者는, 先修其身하고, 欲修其身者는, 先正其心하고, 欲正其心者는, 先誠其意하고, 欲誠其意者는, 先致其知-니,, 致知는, 在格物이니라 하고 다시 이로대, 『物格而所에, 知至하고, 至至而后에 志誠하고, 志誠而后에 心正하고, 心正而后에 身修하고, 身修而后에 家齊하고, 家齊而后에, 國治하고, 國治而后에 天下平이니라』. 하고, 又曰 『自天子至於庶人히, 壹是皆以修身爲本이니라』.는 絶對平等의 人本主義를 세우고, 行進하는 順序를 嚴喩하기 위하야, 『其本이 亂而末治者-否矣며, 其所厚者에 薄이오, 而其所薄者에 厚하리 未之有也-니라』. 고 햇나니다. 이 大學格致의 解釋은 가튼 儒者로도 異同의 見이 不無하나 그러나 鄙人의 解釋은 必히 格一物致一知 (良知) 誠一意, 正一心, 修一身으로 落着이 되는 知行合一의 內容임니다. 鄙著新大學講義에 이러케 釋明한 것이 잇음니다. 『明德子, 良知, 素仁, 兼其義也. 設之則, 其爲物, 如明鏡照物 (認識만은 鏡體喩外에 別노 解할 것). 應物無僞, 隨現照之, 照則通, 通則親矣. 蔽則塞, 塞則疏矣 親疏通塞, 乃是仁不仁之標蟙則, 局有明, 德, 而其用之不親者無矣. 民者衆庶之義, 즉 人與事物代表之言也. 至善者, 正心處也此心之格于物而了致誠正時, 修身, 作矣. 修身, 作矣, 而齊治平, 推矣. 故, 設之正心, 至善本體, 즉 厥中, 是也』. 又格致釋明에 曰 『(上畧-원문) 茲有父身一個, 對子行慈愛之道則, 子爲物也. 子身一個, 對父行奉養之道則, 父爲物也. 然而大學格致之本義, 其用法條理, 須要得知行合一也. 不是則支離漶漫, 不復見得誠意之實矣. 假令以父對其子, 憫其愚則, 使之讀, 憫其粗率則, 使之習禮矣. 憫其兼與粗率者, 目是慈愛中所感覺, 而發憫者矣. 知此爲憫故, 즉 使之讀書習禮也. 즉 使之讀之習禮者, 是, 知此之意誠矣. 此意誠矣 而此心正矣. 此心正矣, 而此身修矣. 此身修之, 而方是父慈之道成也. 以子對其父, 而恐或違令則, 以之養志, 恐或未豫則, 以之定省矣. 恐其違令與未豫者, 自是奉養中所感覺, 而生恐者矣. 知此爲恐故, 즉 以之養志, 定省也. 즉 以之養志, 定省者, 是, 知此之意誠矣. 此意誠意, 而此心正矣. 此心正矣, 而此身修矣. 此身修矣, 而方是子孝之道成也,<110> 然而致其知而有未行者, 此則懈怠所以暴棄者矣. 故傳曰 『如惡之臭, 如好好色』. 之喩, 正謂此知行上用工也 實其前如好好色, 懲其弊如惡之臭則, 其意必誠無自欺矣. 此所謂知行合一也. (下畧-원문)』. 라 하얏나니다. 孟子의 所謂 『良知良能』 說과 王陽明의 所謂 「知者行之始也, 行者知之成也』. 라 함과 朱子所謂 『不待求之民生日用彛倫之外也』. -라한 等擧不勝數의 實現主義는, 儒學의 人本主義上可缺치 못할 骨子임니다. 다시 孔子의 人格完成主義는, 所謂群聖의 集大成이라 稱하는 儒敎의 代表主義임니다. 그 仁으로써 人生的 最高全德을 삼아, 一切의 根本原理를 말한 것은, 天地原性의의 全面意義를 包含 命名한 것으로서, (陸象山이 曰 『仁自夫子發之』) 실노 天地의 生成萬物하는 大德을, 遺憾없이 體駿發明 한 글字임니다. 이 仁이야말노,, 人生의 全般諸德을, 統攝一貫하는 最高全德 (吾道一以貫之)임니다. 이것이 그 王道政治의 精神点임니다. 中原天下를 統一한 平天下實現이, 실노 偶然이 안이란 말은, 우에서도 重復說道햇거니와, 그 基礎思想이 絶對倫理主義임이, 此敎此道의 獨特한 長点인 것을 거듭 말하나니다.

王道는 最初부터 社會共産主義임니다. 갈맑스의 社會共産主義와 다른 点은, 互相歷史的 環境 及 淵源의 다름이 잇고, 또 하나는 個人主義에서 洗鍊된 社會思想이오, 하나는, 最初부터 家族主義에서, 發展된 社會主義임니다. 易同人初九象에 曰 「出門同人을, 又 誰咎也-리오』. 하고, 仝久二에 曰 『同人于宗이니, 吝토다』. 하얏으니. 이와 가티 家族主義에서 洗鍊하야, 國家에 나아가고, 天下에 나아가서, 究竟은 『親不獨其親이오, 子不獨其子-오, 老有所歸하고, 幼有所養하며, 貨는 惡無于已언정, 不藏乎身하고, 力은 惡其不出於已언정 不施之於人也 (下畧)-라』. 하는 大同世界를 理想한 社會共産主義이엇음니다. 그리고 다시 크게 다른 点은, 하나는 絶對倫理, 道德主義인데, 다른 하나는, 絶對惟利, 惟權主義임니다. 惟利, 惟權임으로, 方法은, 鬪爭일 박게 없고, 倫理道德임으로, 仁政에 賴치 안을 수 없음이외다. 그 外 細目에 이르러서는, 하나는, 古制인 만콤 簡單하고, 하나는, 現代인만콤 詳細함이외다. 그러나 詳細와 簡單은, 아모 圭角이 없을 것이오, 오직 生活의 要素되는 生産과 配當에 이르러서의 機會를 公共케 하는 点만은, 同一한 精神에서 나온 것이오, 그 機會를 利用하는 方法 等에 이르러서는, 또 差異가 생길 것 것이니 하나는, 天賦人能을 制限하야, 優劣平等을 理想하고, (現 소베트政策) 다른 하나는, 人能의 優劣은 自由에 막기고, 惟一生活의 機會만을, 公共케 하는 것이엇음니다. (王道政治)

鄙人은 經濟學者도 안이며, 政治, 法律學者도 안인 同時에, 哲學者도 안임으로, 이제 새삼스러이 갈맑스에게, 歸宗하려는 생각이 아일 뿐外라, 베룬스타인의 主義에 共鳴함도 안임은<111> 勿論이요, 다못 西洋式 現政治制度가, 너머나 大衆除外의 政策임에서, 부드치워 이러나는 우리 東洋王道政治思想을, 그저 破古紙 속에 무더두는 일이 너머나 안가워서, 그 所謂 『王道硏究』란 것을 云爲햇다는 告白입니다. 王道라 하면, 누구든지 聖人의 道라고 안하는 사람이 없는 것은, 東洋에서는 事實이 안입니까? 只今 主義를 危險視하는 政治當局者들도, 儒學의 四書三經이라면, 敎科書로 認可함은 勿論이오, 다시 그 聖賢政治인 것을 謳歌함이 아입니까? 萬人의 硏究코저 한다는 王道가 즉 이 聖賢이며, 四書三經의 말슴을, 現代化로 演義해 본다는 意味가 이엇슴니다. 傳에 曰 『有人이면 玆有士-오, 有士면 玆有財오, 有財면, 玆有用이니라』. 하지 안엇음니가? 土地는 잇으나, 土着之民은, 畊食할 土地가 없어서, 將老幼携하고 散而之四方을 하는 事實이 잇다고 하면, 彼 『有人有土』 之說도 판판한 헛소림니다마는, 詩周頌에 曰 『貽我來牟, 帝命率育. 無此疆爾界』. 라 하니, 이는, 有人有土의 史證이요, 詩北山에 曰 『普天之下에 莫非王土』. 라 하니, 이는, 部落的으로부터 國家組織에 나아간 後의 土地國有의 史蹟을 이름이외다.

古代이 産業은, 農作이 웃듬임으로, 民衆의 生活安定을 卜함이, 먼저 土地의 配當을 決定함이, 最先且最大의 問題일 것은 勿論이외다. 그리하야, 其時의 政府와 人民間의 予受는, 엇던 方式으로 되엇든가 하면, 政府는 地主가 되고, 人民은 畊作者가 엇는데, 그 分配의 方式은, 孟子所傳에 據하건대, 『夏禹氏五十而貢하고, 殷人七十而助하고, 周人百畝而徹』. 아라 하얏으니.
一. 貢 貢의란 것은, 人民이 畊作生産한 收穫 中에서, 其一部를, 政府에 納하는 것인 바, 『較數歲之中以爲常』. 이란 것을 보면, 現今 우리 이 賭租라는 意味와 가튼데, 其數額은 未詳하나, 戒曰 十分一이라 하니, 禹貢所謂 百里, 賦納總, 200里, 納銍, 300里, 納秸服, 400里, 栗, 500里, 米』.라 함이, 이것이오.
二. 助 孟子釋助字曰 『助者藉也』. 라 하고 其助制에 云 方里而井. 井九百畝. 其中 爲公田. 八家皆私百畝, 同養公田』. 이라 하얏으니, 公田이란 말은, 八家의 畊食하는 800畝를 私田이라 하고, 八家-合助畊作하야, 政府에 納入하는 田을 公田이라 함이외다. 夏小正에 云 初服于公田』. 詩大田에 云 『雨我公田, 遂及我私』. 라 하엿으니, 今語로써 말하자면 八家-勞力으로써 租稅를 伐納함이외다.
三. 徹 詩公劉에 曰 『徹田爲糧』. 이라 하고,, 又云 『文王治岐畊者九一』. 이라 하얏으니, 此点九一之稅인지 未詳하나, 論語에 云 『哀公問有若曰 「年饑用不足, 如之何?」 有若對曰 「盍徹乎?」 公曰 「二. 吾猶不足, 如之何其徹也?」』. 하얏으니, 此에 據하야 보아도, 九一이란 것이 可然하외다.
右三種說에 대해서 古今所論이 자못 紛紛하야 이에 畢置할 必要가 없고, 오직 孟子의 騰文公에 대한 成論이, 助法임을 據하야 井田法이, 東洋古代 오래 동안 支持해 온 것으로 밋음니다.<112>
然而이, 十一 或 九一이란 租稅*, 國家-人民에게 據田한 後에 밧는 것이오, 今의 租稅는 據田치 안코 밧는 것이니, 그 性質이 判異한 것을 辨理하여야 할 것이외다.

十九

그럼으로 土地私有化한 것은, 必也王政이 覇政化한 後, 流弊因習으로 繼續된 것임이 無違하외다. 우리 朝鮮에 잇서서도, 井田傳說이, 歷史上에 비추어 잇고, 御天題小註에 曰 『高麗太祖, 定田制, 分給臣民百官則, 隨品, 而給之, 身沒則收之, 有罪則收之, 其後兼倂之門一開, 而據田之法, 漸隨弛』. 라 하얏고, 李朝에 와서도, 前日까지, 驛屯, 官屯, 官屯, 軍田 等의 모든 名目이, 모다 土地國有이던 本色이 明燎하지 안함니까? 海外도 亦然하다 하옴니다. 그 外에 大産*의 國家直營은, 王道가 아닌 覇政도 實施한 前例가 多하고, 現代 西洋式政治도, 이것은 만히 行하는 일이 안임니까?
要컨대, 人民으로 하야곰 生活安定은, 絶對問題가 아닐 수 없고 (畧-원문) 그러니까 鄙人은 이에 대하야 엇지 엇지한다는 立言도 아니오, 運動的 宣言도 안이지마는, 다못 四書三經에 일커어 잇는 道理를 講究*(閨-국사편찬위원회)明하며,, 東洋王道政治를, 現代化로 再活케 하야, 世界平和에 一大貢獻이 잇게 하자는 것이, 惟一한 希願이오이다.
