Old Maid (and one other)

Old Maid

Judge: "So then, what is your age (年歲)?"
Old Maid: (Embarrassed) "..."
Judge: "You must absolutely speak honestly. Then, how old were you 10 years ago?"
Old Maid: (Energetically) "Yes, twenty-three!"<268>

Borrowed Thing

As a packed tram (滿員電車) was passing the Chongno intersection (鍾路네거리),
"Hey, hey, please be careful! The tip of your parasol keeps poking my back."
"How could that be?"
"What do you mean? Look here, isn't it poking right now?"
"This parasol is in my hand, but it's not mine. It's because I borrowed it from Pyŏngsik (丙植)."<268>

**Summary**

This article presents two short humorous anecdotes. The first involves an "old maid" who cleverly avoids stating her current age in court by revealing her age from ten years prior. The second anecdote takes place on a crowded tram where a passenger denies responsibility for their poking parasol by claiming it's borrowed. From a historical perspective, these pieces offer insights into social attitudes of the 1930s in Korea, particularly regarding sensitivity about women's age and marriage status, and provide a glimpse into everyday life, such as the mention of crowded trams at Chongno Intersection in Seoul. The humor reflects common social interactions and perhaps coping mechanisms.
