**Body Text Translation:**
If You Analyze a Happy Marriage

In Germany (獨逸), a question was posed: "What would the contents be if one were to analyze the ideal husband and the ideal wife?" According to the recommendations of many people, the decisions were made as follows.

Ideal Wife

Health 23 percent
Beauty 16 percent
Charm/Affection (愛嬌) 14 percent
Neat Appearance 12 percent
Domesticity (Love for children) 11 percent
Skill in Cooking 10 percent
Obedience (從順) 9 percent
Vigor & Temperament 5 percent
Total Above 100 percent
So, how do you feel comparing your wife to this list?

Ideal Husband

Health 20 percent
Wealth/Property 15 percent
Family-oriented 13 percent
Diligence 13 percent
Character/Integrity 13 percent
Thorough Attentiveness 10 percent
Charm/Affection (愛嬌) 8 percent
Neat Appearance 8 percent
Total 100 percent
So, please compare your husband to this list, think deeply, and if there are shortcomings in your husband, strive diligently to correct them. <105>

**Summary**

This short article from the June 1934 issue of *Samch'ŏlli* presents the results of a supposed German survey analyzing the components of an "ideal wife" and an "ideal husband," broken down by percentage points attributed to various qualities. For wives, health, beauty, and charm rank highest, followed by neatness, domesticity (especially regarding children), cooking skills, obedience, and vigor. For husbands, health, wealth, being family-oriented, diligent, and having good character are the top traits, followed by attentiveness, charm, and neatness. The article concludes by urging readers to compare their own spouses to these ideals and, particularly for wives regarding husbands, to work towards correcting any perceived deficiencies. For historians, the article offers a glimpse into the gender ideals and societal expectations being discussed and promoted in colonial Korea during the 1930s, reflecting both traditional Korean values (like obedience for wives, diligence for husbands) and potentially Western influences (framing the analysis as a German survey, use of percentages). The differing priorities for husbands (wealth, diligence) and wives (beauty, domestic skills, obedience) are particularly revealing of the era's gender roles.
