If I Were to Become the Woman Mayor of Seoul?
						Kim Sŏnch'o

If I were to take office as the woman mayor, I would probably get it within Columbia Records. Therefore, the first administrative act after becoming the woman mayor of Seoul would probably have to be controlling records according to what the Columbia (코럼비아) Arts Department script shows and gives.<80>

**Summary**

Kim Sŏnch'o, responding to the hypothetical question of becoming Seoul's female mayor, suggests her appointment would likely originate from within Columbia Records. Consequently, her first act as mayor would be to regulate records based on scripts provided by Columbia's Arts Department. This response might interest historians as it potentially reflects the perceived limited roles or agency for women in public life during the colonial period, even in hypothetical scenarios. It could also be interpreted as a cynical or playful commentary linking political power to commercial or cultural entities like a major record company, perhaps highlighting the influence of such corporations or the author's own entanglement with the entertainment industry.
