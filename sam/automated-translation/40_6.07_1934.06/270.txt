**Body Text Translation:**
If I Were to Become the Female Mayor of Seoul?
						Yi Sŏnhŭi

1. I would summon all the citizens within Seoul and give each one a nutritional injection.

2. I would establish about a hundred "dance halls" and catch everyone, regardless of gender or age, and make them dance.

3. I would prohibit the Salvation Army from marching in groups along the main streets. Because I really dislike seeing it.

4. I would give special treatment to female reporters, and those who violate this would be sentenced to detention. (She is a women's reporter for Kaebyŏk Sa) <59>

**Summary**

Yi Sŏnhŭi, a female reporter for Kaebyŏk Sa, outlines four whimsical policies she would enact if she became the female mayor of Seoul in 1934. These include mass nutritional injections, mandatory dancing in numerous dance halls, banning Salvation Army street marches, and granting special treatment to female journalists under penalty of detention for non-compliance. The article offers a glimpse into the social imagination and concerns of a modern, professional woman in colonial Seoul. Historians might find interest in the blend of modern concerns (public health via nutrition, modern entertainment like dance halls) with authoritarian methods, the commentary on public space (dislike of Salvation Army marches), and the specific focus on the status and treatment of female professionals (journalists), reflecting both the era's social changes and the author's personal perspective.
