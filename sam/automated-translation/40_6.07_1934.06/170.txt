Author: N/A
Article Type: 잡저 (Miscellaneous writing)

A. Is the Labor General Federation (勞總) signboard still there?
B. It is. At 88 Kyŏnji-dong (堅志洞).
A. Is the Farmers' General Federation (農總) signboard there too?
B. Of course—also at 88.
A. The Youth General Federation (靑總) signboard too?
B. Yes—also at 88.
A. Who's guarding them?
B. Elder Chŏng Unyŏng (鄭雲永) is.
A. Don't they tell him to take them down? Especially these days, even just the signboards could cause trouble [literally: X could arise].
B. Apparently, suggestions [to remove them] come occasionally. When they do, Elder Chŏng's reply is a masterpiece.
A. How so?
B. He supposedly says, "Since I took responsibility for them, if I don't hand them over to anyone but take them down myself, won't they accuse me of being a signboard thief and charge me with larceny (절盜罪)? Therefore, I cannot take them down." Then, they just shut their mouths and leave.<47>

**Summary**

This short piece recounts a conversation about Elder Chŏng Unyŏng, who continues to guard the signboards for the defunct Labor, Farmers', and Youth General Federations at 88 Kyŏnji-dong, despite pressure to remove them. When advised to take them down, Chŏng cleverly deflects by arguing that doing so himself, without formally handing them over, would make him liable to charges of theft. This witty excuse allows him to preserve the signs. For historians, this anecdote offers a glimpse into the atmosphere of colonial Korea where displaying symbols of disbanded nationalist or socialist-leaning organizations was risky. It highlights individual agency and subtle resistance (or perhaps stubborn adherence to bureaucratic logic) against perceived pressure, likely from authorities, using clever wordplay rather than direct confrontation.
