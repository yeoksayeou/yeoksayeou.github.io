Sending Off a Friend
						I Paek

Green mountains lie across the north wall,
White water winds around the east city.

Here, we part ways,
A lone tumbleweed on a ten-thousand-li journey.

Floating clouds, the traveler's aimless thoughts,
Setting sun, the old friend's lingering affection.

Waving hands, you depart from here,
Neighing, neighing, the horses reluctant to part.<72>

**Summary**

This is a classic Tang Dynasty Chinese poem by Li Bai (I Paek), titled "Sending Off a Friend". It evokes the bittersweet feeling of parting, set against a backdrop of nature. The poet contrasts the enduring landscape (mountains, river) with the transient nature of the friend's journey (lone tumbleweed, floating clouds) and conveys deep affection through the imagery of the setting sun and the sounds of reluctant horses. The inclusion of this famous Chinese poem in a Korean magazine from the colonial era (1934) is noteworthy. It might reflect a continued appreciation for shared East Asian classical literary traditions, potentially serving as a subtle expression of cultural identity distinct from the colonizer's influence, or simply the inclusion of widely admired literature. Historians could find it indicative of the cultural content consumed by Koreans during this period and how classical Chinese heritage was viewed and utilized.
