If I Were to Become the Female Mayor of Seoul?
						U Pongun (禹鳳雲)

I would make the citizens escape from vanity (虛榮) and thoroughly abolish the custom of luxury (奢侈),
and I would raise taxes on the price of cosmetics (化裝品價) to make them about 100 times more expensive than they are now.<57>

**Summary**

U Pongun (禹鳳雲) states that if she were the female mayor of Seoul, her priorities would be to rid citizens of vanity and abolish luxurious customs. Her primary method to achieve this would be to drastically increase taxes on cosmetics, making them 100 times their current price. From a historical perspective, this short response reveals contemporary concerns about perceived moral decline associated with vanity and luxury in colonial Seoul. U Pongun's focus on cosmetics specifically targets female consumption, and her proposed solution reflects an idea of using significant state intervention (taxation) for social engineering and moral reform, offering a glimpse into one woman's perspective on civic issues during that era.
