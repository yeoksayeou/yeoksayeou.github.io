Ch'unwŏn's "That Woman's Life" (그 女子의 一生) certainly surpasses Yamamoto Yūzō and Émile Zola. Yet, while Yamamoto loses in story, he wins in thought, and Zola loses in thought but wins in depiction. Ch'unwŏn greatly wins in story, depiction, and literary style, but his thought is still unknown. I wish that, unlike the preview, he wouldn't make "Kŭmbong" (金鳳) into a "Woman Who Came Seeking the Way Through Regret" (女子來流德), but rather end it like Joan of Arc, Elena, or at least Kim Maria or Chŏng X-myŏng.

Detective novels serialized in the Chosŏn Ilbo! Alas, is there any greater folly than throwing stones in the path of the budding flower of new literature, which is just starting to take root? Is there any greater blasphemy against the literary world or insult to the readers?

Pinghŏ's talented writing has reached a fiery maturity in "Equator" (赤道), but he forces in story elements and rhetoric not of his true intention, merely to flatter the readers. Pinghŏ, transcend the readers! Do not become a slave to the interests of the ignorant masses. Do not popularize the art novel.

Make popular novels artistic! Have you forgotten that while Tanizaki Jun'ichirō and Yamamoto Yūzō have long lives even when writing for newspapers, the likes of Kikuchi Kan and Katō Takeo are but mayflies?

P'alp'ong's "Midnight Sun" (深夜의 太陽) has the stiffness of a direct translation in its title, and there's a danger of dryness due to the lack of women in the work. Dreams, imagination, and romance<226> are the mascots of a novelist.

How much more dignified has the literary world become since a certain XX person laid down their pen? How much jazzy noise has disappeared? Though there are still one or two others I wish would lay down their pens.

What is the Yonhŭi Professional School Literature Department (延專文科) there for? It hasn't produced a single writer. Isn't the Ewha Professional School Literature Department (梨專文科) ashamed? It has only produced a single female poet. It would be better instead to use that money to guarantee the livelihood of writers.

Ŭnsang's Sijo poems drag the present day into the distant past. Drag the distant past into the present! For themes, rhyme, and meter, break the mold, break the mold!

The Theater Arts Association (劇藝術協會) should move from Western plays to its own now. If you must do an old play like "Nora," do "Ch'unhyang-jŏn" (春香傳) instead. The Nora type was already sufficiently done by the T'owŏrhoe.

"Willow Tree Dock—" (버드나무선—) started on the right path but why did it go astray onto a side path? Now, make it your own, your own!

Bring out Tongin's second "Chamsa" (잠자), Sangsŏp's second "Mansejŏn" (萬歲前), Pinghŏ's second "Chosŏn's Face" (朝鮮의 얼골), Ch'unwŏn's second "Kasir" (嘉實)! Everyone, return to the short story! Newspaper serial novels are merely temporary entertainment for the ignorant masses. They are not the path for a genius writer to devote their energy.<227>

**Summary**

This essay by "Ch'obyŏngjŏng" (likely a pen name) offers a sharp critique of the Korean literary scene in 1934. The author evaluates prominent writers like Ch'unwŏn (Yi Kwang-su), Pinghŏ (Yŏm Sang-sŏp), and P'alp'ong (Kim Tong-in), comparing them to Japanese authors (Yamamoto Yūzō, Tanizaki Jun'ichirō, Kikuchi Kan, Katō Takeo) and Western figures (Émile Zola, Joan of Arc). The piece laments the trend of popularization, particularly the serialization of detective novels in newspapers like the Chosŏn Ilbo, urging writers to prioritize artistic integrity over mass appeal ("Do not become a slave to the interests of the ignorant masses"). It criticizes educational institutions (Yonhŭi, Ewha) for failing to produce significant writers and calls for a return to Korean themes (like Ch'unhyang-jŏn) and innovative forms, especially the short story, over long newspaper serials. The author urges major writers to produce sequels to their acclaimed earlier works, focusing on artistic depth rather than ephemeral entertainment.

From a historical perspective, the article reveals the intense dialogue between Korean literature and Japanese/Western influences during the colonial period. The explicit comparisons and the call to avoid mere imitation or pandering highlight the struggle for a distinct Korean literary identity. The concern over the commercialization of literature via newspapers and the debate between "art novels" and "popular novels" reflect broader cultural anxieties. The criticism of educational institutions points to the perceived gap between formal education and actual literary production, while the call to revisit Korean classics like *Ch'unhyang-jŏn* underscores a desire to ground modern literature in native traditions, albeit in innovative ways.

文壇歸去來
						草兵丁
春園의 「그 女子의 一生」 確實히 山本有三, 에밀졸라를 壓頭. 또 山本은 스토리엔 敗하엿스나 思想엔 勝하엿고, 졸라는 思想엔 敗하엿스나 描寫엔 勝. 春園에게는 스토리와 描寫와 文彩엔 大勝이나 아직 思想은 未知, 願컨대 豫告모양으로 「金鳳」이를 悔恨求道하는 「女子來流德」을 만들지 말고 야간 짠다-크, 에레나 하다못해 金마리아, 鄭X鳴으로 끗내소.

朝鮮日報에 探偵小說 連載, 嗟呼 겨우 자리 잡히려하는 新文藝의 꼿의 길에 돌 던지는 妄擧, 文壇冒瀆, 讀者 侮辱 이에서 더함 잇스랴.

憑虛의 才筆 「赤道」에 이르러 빨가케 爛熟, 다만 讀者에 阿諛코저 本意아닌 스토리와 修辭를 强入. 憑虛여 讀者에 超越하라. 衆愚興味의 奴隷되지 말라. 藝術小說 通俗化하지 말고.

通俗小說 藝術化하라. 谷崎潤一郞 山本有三은 新聞에 써도 生命이 길되 菊池寬, 加藤武雄輩 하로살이에 不過함을 이젓는가.

八峯의 「深夜의 太陽」, 標題에 直譯味잇서 억세고 作中에 女性업서 乾燥할 危險잇다. 꿈과 空想과 로-만스은<226> 小說家의 마스콧트.

XX한 사람 붓을 거두니 文壇 얼나마 品位잇서 젓는가. 얼마나 째스的 騷音이 사라젓는가. 아직 붓 거두어 줫스면 하는 분 한둘이 잇기는 하나.

延專文科 무얼하려 잇는가. 1人의 作家 냄이 업고 梨專文科 붓그럽지 안는가. 겨우 女 詩人 1人을 내엇슬 뿐. 차라리 마서 그 돈으로 文人生活 保障하엿스면.

殷相의 時調, 現代를 끄을고 먼-歷史 속으로 드러간다. 먼-歷史 속에서 現代로 끄을고 나오라. 題材도, 韻도, 格律도 破格으로 破格으로!

劇藝術協會 西劇에서 이제는 제 것으로 옴기라. 묵은 「노라」 하겟거든 차라리 「春香傳」 하라. 노라類는 土月會로 이미 足.

「버드나무선-」 길로 길을 올케 들엇다가 엇재 橫道로 갓노. 인제는 제 것으로 제 것으로!

東仁 第2 「잠자」 想涉 第2 「萬歲前」 憑虛 第2 「朝鮮의 얼골」 春園 第2 「嘉實」 내노으라. 모다들 短篇에 復歸하라. 新聞長篇은 衆遇의 一時的 娛樂物에 不過. 天才作家의 精力 드릴 길은 못되는 것.<227>
