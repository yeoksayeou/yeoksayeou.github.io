In the reception room of the Dong-A Ilbo President, hangs a fine piece of poetry and calligraphy. It says:

Tongue worn out, lips scorched, expending bitter words,
Morning after morning, awakening one's own soul.
Look closely at the meaning of each character, each line,
It is not soot and smoke, it is traces of blood.

By Sŏkchae Sŏ Pyŏng'o <106>

**Summary**

This short article presents a four-line Hanja poem found hanging in the reception room of the Dong-A Ilbo newspaper's president in 1934. The poem, written by Sŏkchae Sŏ Pyŏng'o, speaks of the toil and sacrifice involved in earnest expression ("bitter words"), comparing the written word not to mere ink ("soot and smoke") but to "traces of blood," implying deep personal suffering and commitment poured into the act of writing or communication. For historians, this piece offers a glimpse into the self-perception and perhaps the intense atmosphere within a major Korean newspaper during the colonial period. The poem's themes of suffering, sacrifice, and the gravity of words resonate strongly with the known struggles of Korean intellectuals and journalists under Japanese rule, suggesting the weight they felt their words carried.
