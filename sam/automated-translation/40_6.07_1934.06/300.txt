天才全盛期-思想家 (The Golden Age of Geniuses - Thinkers)
Schopenhauer published "The World as Will and Representation" at age 30.

Malthus's "An Essay on the Principle of Population" was at age 32.

Fichte's "System of Ethics" was at age 36.

Wang Yangming's "Theory of the Unity of Knowledge and Action" was at age 37.<64>

**Summary**

This short article excerpt lists prominent thinkers – Schopenhauer, Malthus, Fichte, and Wang Yangming – and the relatively young ages at which they published seminal works, all before the age of 40. From a Korean colonial history perspective, this piece is interesting as it presents examples of intellectual achievement, implicitly setting a standard or perhaps offering inspiration. The inclusion of Wang Yangming, a highly influential Neo-Confucian philosopher relevant to East Asian intellectual history, alongside major Western thinkers, is particularly noteworthy, suggesting an awareness and integration of both traditions within the intellectual discourse of 1930s Korea.
