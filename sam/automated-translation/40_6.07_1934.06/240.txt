If I Were to Become Seoul’s Woman Mayor?
						Hwang Aesidŏk

Regarding "Mayor," whenever one becomes mayor, there are things that must be executed as the very first priority at that time.

If I were to become the "Mayor of Seoul" right now?

I would carry out the following two administrative actions.

One. To give exactly the same political rights (政權) to men and women.

One. While abolishing the brothel districts (주사청루) in Seoul, I would strictly crack down on all pleasure-seeking establishments/groups (유홍배 - 遊興輩), and instead, I would establish facilities to provide jobs for the unemployed (무직자).<56>

**Summary**

In this short survey response, Hwang Aesidŏk outlines two primary goals if she were to become the mayor of Seoul: establishing gender equality in political rights and tackling social issues by abolishing licensed brothels, cracking down on other entertainment establishments, and creating employment opportunities for those without jobs. From a historical perspective, the article is interesting as it reflects early feminist aspirations for political equality and highlights concerns about prostitution and unemployment in colonial Seoul during the 1930s. It offers a glimpse into the progressive social reform ideas held by some Korean women intellectuals of the era, addressing both political rights and socio-economic problems.
