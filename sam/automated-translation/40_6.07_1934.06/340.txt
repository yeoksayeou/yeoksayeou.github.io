Willow colors, uneven, conceal the painted pavilion;
Morning orioles' cries send sorrow filling the palace.
Year after year, flowers fall, unseen by anyone;
Empty processions, spring streams flow out from the imperial return.<71>

**Summary**

This short Hanja poem by "Kungsŭ" (Palace Sorrow) depicts a melancholic scene around a palace. It evokes feelings of decay, absence, and hidden sorrow through imagery like uneven willow branches obscuring a pavilion, mournful bird cries, unseen falling flowers, and empty streams associated with a royal return. From a historical perspective, the poem, published in colonial Korea in 1934, is potentially significant. The pen name "Palace Sorrow," combined with the themes of decay and absence surrounding a royal setting (palace, imperial return), strongly suggests an allegorical lament for the lost sovereignty of Korea and the diminished status of its former monarchy under Japanese rule. Historians might find it interesting as a subtle expression of national sentiment and loss during a period of censorship.
