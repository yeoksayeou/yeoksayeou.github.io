Climbing Yueyang Tower
						Du Fu
昔聞洞庭水
Long ago I heard of Dongting's waters,
今上岳陽樓
Now I climb Yueyang Tower.
吳楚東南折
Wu and Chu split southeast,
乾坤日夜浮
Heaven and Earth float day and night.
親朋無一字
From family and friends, not a single word;
老病有孤舟
Old and sick, I have only a lonely boat.
戎馬關山北
Warhorses north of the mountain passes,
憑軒涕泗流
Leaning on the railing, tears stream down.<73>

**Summary**

This classic poem by the Tang Dynasty poet Du Fu expresses feelings of awe at the vast landscape viewed from Yueyang Tower over Dongting Lake, contrasted with deep personal sorrow. Themes include the grandeur of nature versus human transience, loneliness, displacement due to war ("Warhorses north of the mountain passes"), aging, and illness. The publication of this poem in a Korean magazine in 1934 is interesting. For historians, it might reflect a shared sense of displacement, national suffering, or longing for stability among Koreans during the colonial period, finding resonance in Du Fu's lamentations amidst the turmoil of his own time. It also highlights the continued appreciation and relevance of classical Chinese literature within Korean intellectual circles.
