Anecdotes about Literary Figures

Pyŏkch'o (碧初), while writing "Im Kkŏkchŏng chŏn" (林巨正傳), prepared a detailed memorandum noting the distance in *ri* (里) from Pongsan (鳳山) to the Imjin River (臨津江) ferry crossing. Somehow, he lost that piece of paper covered in tiny writing, causing him distress for a while. Fortunately, he found it after 4 or 5 days and breathed a sigh of relief.

Years ago (年前) in P'yŏngyang (平壤), when Yanagi Muneyoshi (柳宗悅) gave a lecture, the novelist Chŏn Yŏngt'aek (田榮澤氏) served as the interpreter. He committed a major blunder (大妄發) by translating "Omatsuri sawagi" (御祭リ騷ぎ - festival ruckus) as "the act of making noise during ancestral rites."

This spring (今春), An Sŏ (岸曙), accompanied by his wife (同夫人), frequented the horse racing track (競馬場) outside Tongdaemun (東大門) for horse racing (競馬). In just a few days (不過數日), he lost 200 *wŏn* (圓). It seems he wrongly followed in the footsteps of Tongin (東仁), who, according to an old story (故事), became rich from horse racing (競馬成富) several years ago by winning 3,000 *wŏn* in a day or two.

P'albang (八峰) is busy running around (奔走) Ch'ungch'ŏng Province (忠淸道) and Hwanghae Province (黃海道) prospecting for gold mines (金鑛). If the gold mine (金鑛) were sympathetic (有情), it surely (應當) would reveal itself (現身).

Recently, Yohan (이 요한), Paekhwa (白華), Wŏlt'an (月灘), An Sŏ (岸曙), and P'ain (파인) have been returning to Tang poetry (唐詩). Is this proving the words of their senior, Pyŏkch'o (碧初), that "Eastern people (東洋人) eventually fall back into Chinese poetry (漢詩)"?

Historian (史家) Aeru (崖溜) Kwŏn Chin'gyu (權眞奎), while traveling in a certain region (某 地方), wrote "Author" (著作) as his occupation on the lodging registration form (宿泊届). The inspecting policeman (臨檢巡査公) asked, "Are you a chopstick (젓가락) maker?"

Yubang (惟邦) Kim Ch'anyŏng (金瓚永), while traveling in the countryside with a certain friend (某友), wrote "Painter" (畵家) as his occupation. The inspecting policeman (臨檢巡査公) said, "Ah, so you're a painter (繪描き)?". He deeply regretted (長恨) not being able to write "Artist" (藝術家).

After Ch'unwŏn's (春園) wife (夫人) went to Kangwŏn Province (江原道) for recuperation (靜養次),<250> he followed her west just a few days later (數日后). He is one of the devoted husbands (愛妻家).

Female writer (女流作家) Chang Tŏkcho (張德祚) recently had the happy event (慶事) of childbirth (近解産). Her husband (夫君) Pak Myŏnghwan (朴明煥) is eagerly awaiting (鶴首苦待) her works (作品).

Tongin (東仁), having exhausted (消盡) a family fortune of 200,000 *wŏn* (萬圓 財産) at the house by the ferry in P'yŏngyang (平壤), now laments (而今長嘆曰), "It's because the house site itself was inauspicious (凶家)."

Hoewŏl (懷月) Pak Yŏnghŭi (朴英熙) forcefully negotiated (强行談判) with Hyŏndae P'yŏngnonsa (現代評論社) to pay the manuscript fee (原稿料) for Yi Kiyŏng's (李箕永) confiscated (押收) manuscript, which they initially refused to pay, securing 40 *wŏn* (圓) for him. Though it's in the past, it's a beautiful story of friendship (友情美談).

Regarding Hugo's work (유-고作品) "Ah, Mujŏng" (아-無情 - Les Misérables): 30 years ago (年 前) from now, Hong Myŏnghŭi (洪命憙) lectured at Posŏng School (普成學校) in Seoul (서울). Among those captivated while listening (聽講心醉) was Yang Paekhwa (梁白華在). Also, Hamong's (何夢) adaptation (飜案) and Yuktan's (六堂) abridged translation (抄譯) were published (登載) in "Ch'ŏngch'un" (靑春). This is a memorable episode from history (古史).

Ch'unsŏng (春城) No Chayŏng (盧子泳), in Sŏngbuktong (城北洞), famous for its beautiful scenery (泉石의 美), makes a living (生業) through cosmetics manufacturing (化粧品製造). Among literary figures (文人), there is also the playwright (劇作家) Hyŏn Ch'ŏl (玄哲) who is a cosmetics merchant (化粧品商).

The French literature scholar (佛文學者) and poet (詩人) Yi Hŏnsu (李軒氺) has taken up (就任) a commissioned position (囑託) at the Broadcasting Section (放送課) of the Communications Bureau (遞信局). Playwright (劇作家) Kim Unjŏng (金雲汀) and poet (詩人) Yi Hayun (異河潤) are in the Literature and Arts Department (文藝部) of JODK.

An Sŏ (岸曙) has leaped forward (躍進) into the popular song world (流行歌界) via records (레코-드). He has already composed over 140 songs and released them to the market (市場). How prosperous (盛哉)!

Sanghŏ (尙虛) Yi T'aejun's (李泰俊) talented writing (才筆) grows stronger as he continues (愈往愈健). He has taken up his pen for another long novel (長篇).<251>

**Summary**

This article presents a series of short anecdotes about various Korean literary figures active in 1934. It touches upon their writing processes (Pyŏkch'o's meticulous notes for "Im Kkŏkchŏng chŏn"), personal lives (Ch'unwŏn's devotion to his wife, Chang Tŏkcho's childbirth), financial situations (An Sŏ's gambling losses, Tongin's squandered fortune, P'albang's gold prospecting, No Chayŏng's cosmetics business), interactions with Japanese terms and authorities (Chŏn Yŏngt'aek's translation error, police mistaking writers' occupations), career shifts (Yi Hŏnsu's radio job, An Sŏ's success in songwriting), literary trends (return to Tang poetry), and acts of friendship (Pak Yŏnghŭi helping Yi Kiyŏng). The piece offers glimpses into the diverse activities, struggles, and connections within the literary circle of colonial Korea. Historians might find the anecdotes about writers' financial activities (gambling, mining, business ventures), their interactions with colonial police (misunderstandings of occupation), the mention of specific Japanese cultural elements like "Omatsuri sawagi" and the policeman's Japanese phrase, and the details about broadcasting (JODK) particularly revealing about the socio-economic conditions and cultural landscape of the period.
