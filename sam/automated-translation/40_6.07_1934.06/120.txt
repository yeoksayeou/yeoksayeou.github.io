Contents of the US-China Aviation Secret Pact, Recent Aviation Fever in China

Recently, China has been engrossed in a three-year expansion plan for 1,500 aircraft. In truth, as a result of the suffering endured by the Chinese people due to the lack of an air force during the Manchurian Incident and the Shanghai Incident, the fervor for an air force has suddenly intensified recently. On January 28th last year, the anniversary of the Shanghai Incident, the citizens pledged to skip one meal a day and donate the savings towards air combat readiness, further resolving to designate this day as Aviation Enhancement Commemoration Day. Furthermore, taking advantage of this opportunity, efforts are being made to sell aircraft from various European and American countries and to recruit technicians and pilot instructors. It has been repeatedly reported in newspapers that the United States <43> has concluded a top-secret aviation pact with China and is striving to cooperate and assist not only in civil aviation but also in military aviation to enhance and improve China's aviation capabilities. Now, introducing the contents of that secret pact:

1.  The fundamental spirit of the secret pact lies in the mutual cooperation between the US and China to strive for the securing of world peace and the upholding of the Nine-Power Treaty, and to pursue the strengthening of aviation and the establishment of an air force in order to carry through their conviction of respecting territorial integrity. The United States assumes full responsibility for planning these facilities, and neither party shall conclude any treaty related to the aviation of a third country without mutual consent.

2.  The total expenses required for the improvement and enhancement of Chinese aviation are set for the time being at 40 million US dollars, half of which will be procured by the Chinese government, and half will be provided as a credit loan by the United States government.

3.  One aircraft manufacturing plant will be established in Eastern China and <44> four repair factories along the coast. The necessary machinery will be supplied by the United States within half a year, and the factory managers will be appointed Americans.

4.  To meet the needs of the current situation, the US-China air routes will be freely determined by the American side. Last year, airfields were constructed in key locations on China's east coast such as Ch'üanchou (泉州), Huat'ou (化頭), Chinhae (鎭海), Fuchou (福州), and Haichou (海州). 80% of the expenses were covered by the US government, and the required aircraft are to be American-made.

5.  To meet national defense needs, over the next three years, 155 light bombers, 95 heavy bombers, 330 reconnaissance aircraft, and 260 fighter aircraft, totaling 835 aircraft, will be prepared. Three-fourths of these will be American-made aircraft, and all flight squadron instructors will be Americans.

The test flight for pioneering the 1,600 nautical mile air route between Shanghai and Manila last year, which was completed with great success by the China National Aviation Corporation (中國 航空公司), a venture capitalized and managed by the US, is also said <45> to have been conducted based on the aforementioned secret pact. The Sikorsky amphibian aircraft used at that time was the same model as those used by the US military.

In short, through the US-China secret pact, China aims to enhance its aviation by borrowing the strength of the United States while simultaneously checking Japan. The United States, using this opportunity, intends to acquire influential aviation bases in various parts of China, especially on the East Coast, to serve as a driving force in times of emergency. China's future aviation requires consideration alongside the actions of the United States. Optimism is certainly not warranted. <46>

**Summary**

This 1934 article reports on a secret aviation pact between the United States and China, driven by China's desire to build its air force after suffering defeats in the Manchurian and Shanghai Incidents. The pact outlines significant US aid, including a $40 million budget (half loaned by the US), construction of aircraft factories managed by Americans, establishment of airfields on the east coast largely funded by the US, and the provision of 835 military aircraft (mostly US-made) with American instructors over three years. The article suggests China aims to bolster its military and counter Japan, while the US seeks strategic air bases in China for future contingencies, concluding that China's aviation future is tied to US actions and warrants caution. From a Korean colonial history perspective, this article is interesting as it reflects the escalating geopolitical tensions in East Asia involving China, Japan, and the US, viewed from a publication within the Japanese empire. It highlights the military buildup perceived as a threat by Japan (and thus potentially influencing Japanese policy towards Korea and China) and showcases the growing American involvement in Chinese affairs, which would eventually clash with Japanese expansionist ambitions.

米中航空密約內容, 最近中國의 航空熱
最近 中國에서는 飛行機 1,500機의 3年 擴張計劃에 熱中하고 잇다. 실은 中國國民이 滿洲事變과 上海事變에 航空軍이 업서 苦生한 結果 近時 空軍熱이 갑작이 熾烈하야 昨年 1月 28日 上海事變記念日에 國民들은 1日에 1回式 缺食하고 此를 空中戰備에 義捐하기로 約束하고 更히 此日을 航空充實記念日로 決議하엿다. 또 이 機會를 利用하야 歐米諸國의 飛行機의 販賣와 技術者 繰從敎官의 募集에 努力하야 米國의<43> 中國과 極秘密裏에 航空密約을 締結하고 中國의 航空改善을 充實키 위하야 民間航空은 忽論 軍事航空에 대하야서도 協力援助에 努力하고 잇는 거슨 屢次 新聞紙上에 報導된 바와 갓거니와 이제 그 密約의 內容을 紹介하면
1. 密約의 根本精神은 米中兩國은 世界平和의 確保와 9個國條約의 擁護에 힘쓰고 領土保全올 尊重하는 所信을 貫徹키 위하야 서로 協力해서 航空의 充實과 空軍의 樹立을 圖謀함에 잇스며 米國은 全責任을 가지고 此의 施設計劃을 하야 雙方의 同意가 업시는 第3國의 航空에 關係잇는 엇더한 條約이라도 締結치 못함.
2. 中國航空의 改善充實에 要하는 總經費는 當分間 米貨 4,000費로 정하야 其半額은 中國政府에서 調達하고 半額은 米國政府에서 信用貸付함.
3. 中國東部에 飛行機製造工場 1個所와<44> 沿岸에 修理工場 4個所를 設置하야 所要機械는 米國에서 半年以內에 供給하되 該工場長은 米國人을 任命함.
4. 時局의 必要에 應키 위하야 米中航空路는 米國側에서 自由로 假定하야 昨年 中에 中國東海의 要地인 泉州, 化頭, 鎭海, 福州, 海州 等에 飛行場을 建設하되 經費의 8割은 米國政府에서 支出하고 所要의 飛行機는 米國 것을 使用하기로 함.
5. 國防에 應키 위하야 今後 3個年間에 輕爆擊機 155機 重爆擊機 95機 偵察機 330機 驅逐機 260機 合計 835機를 整備하야 그 4分之3은 米國製 飛行機로 하되 飛行隊의 敎官은 全部 米國人으로 함.
昨年 上海 마니라間 1,600海里의 航空路開拓試驗飛行이 米國의 資本經營인 中國 航空公司에 의하야 非常한 成功裏에 完成된 것이지만 이것도<45> 亦是 右密約에 基하야 行한 것이라고 한다. 當時 使用한 슈루스키-水陸兩用機는 米國空軍이 軍用機와 同型이엿다.
요컨대 米中密約에서 中國은 米國의 힘을 빌어서 航空의 充實을 期함과 同時 日本을 牽制하려하고 米國은 이 機會를 利用하야 中國이 各地 특히 東海岸에 有力한 航空根據地를 獲得하야 有事의 時에 原動力을 삼으려는 바 中國에 將來의 航空은 米國의 行動과 갓치 考慮를 요할 바이다. 결코 樂觀을 許치 못할 것이다. <46>
