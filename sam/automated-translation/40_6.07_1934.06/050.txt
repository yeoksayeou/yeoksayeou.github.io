Life's Bulletin Board

The gentlemen currently engaged in romance are as follows. Please avoid unnecessary visits as much as possible. Because there is nothing more disliked than others visiting during the time of romance.

Playwright Yu Ch'i-jin (While in Tokyo studying drama, is currently... with a certain young lady [Continued])

Novelist Yi Chong-myŏng (In a certain neighborhood within the city, is currently... [Below is top secret] with a certain beauty, age 28 (芳紀28))<36>

**Summary**

This short notice from the magazine "Samch'ŏlli" playfully lists two prominent literary figures, playwright Yu Ch'i-jin and novelist Yi Chong-myŏng, who are currently involved in romantic relationships. It humorously advises readers to refrain from visiting them unnecessarily to avoid disturbing their romantic pursuits, hinting at secrecy, especially in Yi Chong-myŏng's case. From a historical perspective, this piece offers a glimpse into the nascent celebrity culture and changing social mores regarding romance in urban colonial Korea during the 1930s. It also highlights the cultural connection with Tokyo, a common destination for Korean intellectuals and artists of the era, and uses the specific blend of Hangul, Hanja, and older Korean orthography characteristic of the time.
