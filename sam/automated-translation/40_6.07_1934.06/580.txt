This Long Poem was sent to Mr. Chŏng Inbo (鄭寅普), pen name Widang (爲堂), in 1930 when I was gazing at the cold moon (寒月) at 101 Hyŏnjŏ-dong (峴底洞). The first half was serialized in the previous issue (前號), and the second half is serialized now.

Years pass and do not stop,
Since we parted, how many stars have moved?

I returned and tread my native soil,
The world is urgent, a good turning point arrives.

People's hearts know where to turn,
Heavenly conscience moves the common people.

Cries shake the high heavens (穹昊),
Sun and stars darken, withdrawing their light.

The masses all gain fearlessness,
Receiving calamity and disaster (刦禍) without refusal.

Although I am not Buddha (佛佗),
I enter prison without hesitation.

After a long time, meeting with you,
Comforting you on losing your loving mother.

Happy that your virtue and work (德業) advance,
Outstandingly surpassing, already incomparable.

Your name penetrates the heavens above,
Your writings are known in the world.

Though in walking, you don't ride a carriage,
In eating, you always wish to gather ferns (採薇) [implying integrity].

Liver and gallbladder (肝膽) mutually without distance [intimate friendship],
How could the way of friendship be damaged?

A plan to move the whole family far away,
Both families, the respected listening to the humble.

The impractical (迂疎) plan came to nothing,
As time drifts (荏苒), strength becomes weaker.

The star of longevity often dims its light [elders passing?],
Crying to heaven, weeping as solitary survivors (孑遺).<122>

Your fate and mine are the same,
Our actions [choices] also mutually dependent.

Grasping earth (擿埴) [acting blindly], it is easy to stumble (蹉跌),
Just becoming the ridicule of worldly people.

Heaven and Earth (乾坤), how many days until rectified?
A scholar is also a man.

Since ancient times, scholars of bitter integrity (苦節士),
Tremblingly (惴惴) dwelling in existing danger.

Selling books, not selling integrity,
Heaven observes these small (區區) personal matters.

Drinking and pecking (飮啄) [daily sustenance], each busy,
Many affairs go against original intentions (素心).

Looking at each other, not in green [youthful] years (靑歲),
Alas, what kind of person is this?

How could our kind be ants or mole crickets (螻蟻)?
Why must we make burrows and holes (窟穴)?

Many birds filling [the sea] unceasingly [like Jingwei],
The sea drying up can also be expected.

Being buried [obscure] enriches later descendants (後昆),
What use is leaving an empty name?

Tonight, entering your dream,
My soul perhaps presents these words.

Though the body is in a net (羅網),
Wings (羽翼) are still held by me.

-(End)-<123>

**Summary**

This text presents the second half of a classical Chinese poem (Hanmun) titled "Recounting Feelings" by Hong Myŏnghŭi, originally sent to his friend Chŏng Inbo in 1930. The poem reflects on the passage of time, the author's return to Korea amid turbulent times, the awakening of public consciousness, and the potential for personal sacrifice (like imprisonment). It praises Chŏng Inbo's scholarly achievements and integrity while lamenting shared hardships, unrealized plans, personal aging, and the difficulties faced by upright scholars. Despite the bleak circumstances ("body in a net"), the poem ends on a note of persistent inner spirit ("wings still held"). For historians of colonial Korea, the poem offers insight into the mood among intellectuals during a period of intensified Japanese rule (post-1930). It hints at political consciousness ("people's hearts know where to turn," "cries shake the heavens"), the suppression faced by figures like Hong (a known socialist sympathizer often imprisoned), and the importance of maintaining scholarly integrity (賣書不賣節) under duress, all expressed through the traditional medium of Hanmun poetry.

						洪命憙
이 長詩는 1930年에 峴底洞 101번지에서 寒月을 바라보고 잇슬 때 爲堂 鄭寅普씨에게 보낸 것으로 上半는 前號에 下半은 今에 연재하는바 이노라.

歲年逝不住
一別星幾移

吾歸踐故土
世急好轉機

人心識歸趣
天良動庶黎

呼聲震穹昊
日星黤收輝

衆皆得無畏
刦禍受不辭

吾雖非佛佗
入獄不遲疑

久後與君見
慰君失母慈

喜君德業進
卓邁已無比

姓名天上徹
文章世間知

行雖不坐車
食常願採薇

肝膽互無隔
交道豈有虧

盡室遠擧計
兩家尊聽卑

迂疎計無成
荏苒力愈微

壽星屢晦彩
呼天泣孑遺<122>

君我命相同
出處亦互依

擿埴易蹉跌
適爲世人嗤

乾坤幾日正
書生亦男兒

古來苦節士
惴惴處已危

賣書不賣節
天鑒區區私

飮啄各自忙
事多素心違

相顧非靑歲
吁嗟何人斯

吾輩豈螻蟻
何必窟穴爲

衆禽塡不已
海枯亦可期

埋沒裕後昆
安用空名垂

今夜入君夢
魂或陳此詞

身雖在羅網
羽翼尙吾持
