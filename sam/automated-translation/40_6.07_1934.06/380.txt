If I Were to Become the Female Mayor of Sŏul!
						Kim Chahŭi

If I were to become the female mayor of Sŏul, I would issue an order prohibiting alcohol and smoking. And I would turn the Monopoly Bureau (專賣局) and the Brewery (釀造場) into a shelter (數容所) for the pitiable beggars crowded together on Chongno Crossroads (鍾路네거리). However, this is all a joke. Me, the female mayor of Sŏul? That would be like the creation of the universe! <78>

**Summary**

Kim Chahŭi responds humorously to the hypothetical question of becoming the female mayor of Sŏul. She suggests she would implement prohibition and convert state-run alcohol and tobacco facilities into shelters for the poor on Chongno Crossroads. She quickly dismisses the idea as a joke, stating that a woman becoming mayor would be an earth-shattering event. From a historical perspective, the article reveals contemporary social concerns (alcoholism, smoking, poverty, vagrancy) and critiques the existence of state monopolies (like the Monopoly Bureau) by proposing their repurposing for social welfare. Most significantly, it underscores the deeply ingrained patriarchal attitudes of the time, where the idea of a woman holding such a significant political office was considered utterly fantastical.
