To Our Esteemed Contributors
						Samch'ŏlli Company Chief Editor

In this issue (號), there were unavoidably (不得已) many manuscripts (原稿), particularly those under a certain major topic (某大題目 以下), that could not be published (揭載). We especially express our deep gratitude (深謝) on these pages (紙上) to the 14 individuals (氏) who wrote (執筆) for us.

Samch'ŏlli Company Chief Editor<46>

**Summary**

This is a brief notice from the Chief Editor of Samch'ŏlli magazine apologizing to contributors whose manuscripts could not be included in the current issue, particularly those related to an unspecified "major topic." The editor thanks the 14 contributors whose work was submitted. From a historical perspective, this short notice reflects the practical constraints of publishing in colonial Korea, hinting at potential editorial decisions or space limitations affecting certain topics ('某大題目'). It also shows the formal interaction between the publisher and its writers.
