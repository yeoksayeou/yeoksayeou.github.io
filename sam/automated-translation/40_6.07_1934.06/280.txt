**Body Text Translation:**
What if I became the female Mayor of Seoul?
						Na Hyesŏk (羅蕙錫)

1. I would implement policies (政司) to change the areas between the Sŏdaemun Line (西大門線) and Map'o Line (麻浦線), between the Tongdaemun Line (東大門線) and Ch'ŏngnyangni Line (淸凉里線), and between the Kwanghŭimun Line (光熙門線) and Wangsimni Line (往十里線) into single zones (一區域).

2. I would ensure that Korean residential areas (朝鮮人市街地) also have the same electrical facilities (電氣시설) as Honmachi-dōri (本町通).

3. I would organize women's groups (女性團體) so they have unified thought (統一的 思想) and action (行動) regarding correcting public morals according to the trends of the times (時勢思想矯風).<60>

**Summary**

Na Hyesŏk, responding to a survey question about what she would do as Seoul's female mayor in 1934, proposes three main initiatives: reorganizing specific tram line zones into single administrative units, ensuring Korean residential areas receive electrical facilities equivalent to those in Japanese-dominated areas like Honmachi-dōri, and organizing women's groups to foster unified thought and action regarding the "correction of morals according to the trends of the times." This response highlights the stark infrastructural inequalities (like electricity access) faced by Koreans in colonial Seoul compared to Japanese residents. Historians might find Na's focus on practical urban planning, demand for equal services, and vision for organizing women (even under the potentially loaded term "correcting morals") particularly interesting, revealing aspects of colonial governance, social conditions, and early feminist consciousness in Korea.
