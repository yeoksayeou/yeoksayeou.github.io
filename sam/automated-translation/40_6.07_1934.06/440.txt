三千里春秋
						滄浪客

Central Nursery taken over and managed by three women from Hwangch'on; Pak Hŭido is a man, Hwang Aesidŏk is a woman, now there is peace of mind.

The Government-General newly establishes a large refinery. "The machines turn and gold comes out, the gold turns and where does it go?"

"Crackdown on Religion-like Groups mentioned"—is this some foreshadowing regarding a certain organization that is amphibious, appearing like both a political association and a religious group?

Mr. Ch'oe Nam donated the funds for his mother's 60th birthday celebration to starving schoolchildren. A matter to be specially noted.

A Korean police chief in Ch'ŏngyang. Is it now only the Vice Governor-General position that remains vacant?

At a time when "editorials" comparable to childish middle school compositions are rampant, the piece on "Integrity and Character" in the Dong-A Ilbo on a certain day in April is a recent masterpiece and profound words.

Say, the Women's Medical College, say, the Association for Promotion of Local Products, say, the Science Movement, etc.—personages whose names are listed in 3 or 4 places simultaneously still have not ceased. Tsk! Prostitute-like techniques of selling one's name. "Let one person guard one enterprise."

Spending 19 *chŏn* and 5 *ri* in advertising fees per copy to sell a 20 *chŏn* magazine—that newspaper company must surely have been filled with long-lasting amazement at the power(?) of a 65-column advertisement. <91>

**Summary**

This article by "Ch'angnang Kaek" presents a series of short, commentary-style observations on current events in colonial Korea in mid-1934. Topics include the management change at a nursery, the establishment of a refinery by the Japanese Government-General (with skepticism about benefits for Koreans), potential government suppression of quasi-political/religious groups, a praiseworthy act of charity by Ch'oe Nam, the appointment of a Korean police chief (viewed cynically), criticism of newspaper editorial quality contrasted with praise for a Dong-A Ilbo piece, disapproval of prominent figures spreading their affiliations too thin, and sarcastic remarks on questionable advertising practices by a newspaper. From a historical perspective, the article offers glimpses into Korean society under Japanese rule: the limited opportunities for Koreans in administration (highlighted by the sarcastic comment on the Vice Governor-General post), social concerns like poverty (starving schoolchildren), the role of the press (both criticized and praised), the activities of civil society organizations, and underlying tensions regarding Japanese economic projects and potential political suppression disguised as control over religious groups.
