Hey, how can one hammer a nail without hurting their finger?

"Well, that's easy. Just hold the hammer (마치) with two hands, right?"<83>

**Summary**

This short article presents a simple joke or riddle. One person asks how to hammer a nail without hitting their finger, and the other replies, somewhat absurdly, to hold the hammer with both hands. The implied humor is that the person asking the question would normally be holding the nail with one hand. This piece serves as light filler content. For historians, it offers a small glimpse into the type of simple humor published in popular magazines during the colonial period, showing a continuation of everyday life and relatable jokes despite the political context.
