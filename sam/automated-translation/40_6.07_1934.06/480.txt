**指染鳳仙花**
						**成川名技 金芙蓉**

A single balsam flower, crimson like blood,
A beauty dyes her fingertips with it.

Facing the mirror, fiery sparks flow like the night moon,
Painting eyebrows, fine rain passes over the spring mountain.

A strong *kŭm* plays, scattering peach blossom petals,
Raising a cup, lightly float the tortoiseshell patterns.

With a captivating smile, she sits resting her chin on her hand,
Still, she touches rouge to her jade-like face.

**哀別 (Sorrowful Parting)**

On the Taedong River, seeing off my lover,
A thousand willow strands cannot tie a person down.

If a painter were to depict this scene,
How would they capture the flute sound on the river at sunset?

** (Untitled)**

On an arm like autumn water, whose name is carved?
Ink enters snow-white skin, each character clear.

Skilled in poetry, skilled in song, and also skilled in dance,
Skilled in all things under heaven.

Though broken and endangered, the flower hat stands,
In the fine spring, encountering the cry of a favored bird.

The plum blossoms of Sŏnhwadang Hall have the color of spring,
The waters of the Taedong River flow moistly, without sound.

Getting drunk with three cups is enough to forget the day,
A single branch of blooming flowers is enough for three springs.

Even if the waters of the Taedong River were to run dry,
My heart will never betray our initial pledge.

Among skills, there is a special skill,
Under the bright moon at midnight, the skill of changing lovers.

Purity like water can turn deep black,
Height like the heavens can become low again. <98>

**首陽山城賞楓 (Appreciating Maple Leaves at Suyangsansŏng Fortress)**

In the deep mountains, a small gathering forms,
Poets encounter the clear autumn.

Since spring came, how many different worlds?
At year's end, this renowned time.

Halfway to heaven, Suyangsansŏng seems poised to fly,
The mountain's full autumn colors climb onto silk clothes.

Red leaves fall like brushstrokes,
White clouds are secluded everywhere.

Brocade trees line the sunset path,
Following the heart, free to go or stay.

Evening mist and slanting rays both reach their end,
Strolling lightly, reciting poetry, then returning.

**留隱寂寺一宿 (Staying Overnight at Ŭnjŏksa Temple)**

Before Ŭnjŏksa Temple, the descending mist is deep,
Tomorrow morning, urging the horse, the road will be hard to find.

Morning mist and evening sun play with light and clarity,
Suddenly resembling the journey of the Daoist of Shanyin.

In the mountains, there are no old friends,
On this day, who sees the guest off?

Birds cry and then return again,
The autumn sun shines on the mountain temple.

The overnight guest suddenly startles,
In the maple forest, the moonlight is thin.

The temple monk seeing off the guest invites them to sit,
Pointing out which peak among the clouds.

All day without rest amidst the red leaves,
Not knowing where Suyangsansŏng is.

The mountain spring's sound accompanies the farewell,
Over a thousand *ri*, it can pierce stone.

Monkey Peak (猴岑) is just a short distance away,
In the clear night, hearing the *saenghwang* and cranes. <99>

**Summary**

This article presents several classical Chinese poems (Hansi) composed by Kim Puyong, identified as a famous kisaeng from Sŏngch'ŏn. The poems explore themes of feminine beauty rituals (dyeing nails with balsam), the sorrow of parting with a lover on the Taedong River, the diverse talents and complex existence of a kisaeng (including artistic skills, pledges of love, resilience, and a potentially cynical view on relationships), and the appreciation of autumn scenery during visits to Suyangsansŏng fortress and Ŭnjŏksa temple.

From a historical perspective, the article is interesting as it showcases the continued practice of traditional Hansi composition by a Korean female entertainer during the Japanese colonial period. It provides insight into the cultural life, sentiments, and perhaps the lived experiences and attitudes of a kisaeng in the 1930s, referencing specific Korean locations and reflecting on themes relevant to her profession and personal life, including a possible commentary on the transactional nature of relationships ("skill of changing lovers"). The blend of traditional aesthetics, personal emotion, and potential social commentary makes it a valuable text for historians studying colonial Korean culture and society.

						成川名技 金芙蓉
一朶鳳仙血色丹
美人染得指尖端

對鏡火星流夜月
畵眉細雨過春山

强琴亂落桃花片
擧酒輕浮玳帶班

嫣然妙笑支頤坐
依舊嚥脂点玉顔

哀別

大洞江上送情人
楬柳千絲未係人

若使畵工描此景
夕陽江上笛聲何

秋水臂上刊誰名
墨入雪膚字字明

詩能歌能又舞能
天下萬事皆是能

絶碎雖危花笠立
陽春之好鳥啼遇

宣化堂梅春有色
大同江水潤無聲

醉得三盃堪遺日
花開一技足三春

寧有大同江水盡
妾心終不負初盟

能之能中別有能
明月三更換夫能

淸無若水深換黑
高莫如天遠更低 <98>

首陽山城賞楓

深山成小會
騷客遇淸秋

春來幾別界
歲晏此名時

天半首陽勢欲飛
滿山秋色上羅衣

紅葉筆筆下
白雲處處幽

錦樹斜陽路
從心任去留

晩靄斜暉俱盡境
輕輕散步詠而歸

留隱寂寺一宿

隱寂寺前落霧深
明朝驅馬路難尋

朝霧夕日弄輕明
忽似山陰道士行

山中無故人
此日誰送客

鳥啼復亦還
秋日照山寺

宿客忽驚魂
楓林月影薄

寺憎送客稿邀坐
指示雲中若箇岑

極日無逸紅葉裡
不知何處首陽城

山泉鳴相送
千里能穿石

猴岑只尺間
淸夜聞笙鶴 <99>
<98-99>
