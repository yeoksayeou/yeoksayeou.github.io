A. It was at a banquet at Siktowŏn (食道園), where 70 or 80 gentlemen of aspiration had gathered.

B. And so?

A. A female doctor who was there—someone famous in the past as a female social activist—she gave a congratulatory address.

B. And so?

A. There was a masterpiece moment.

B. How so?

A. Well—listen. She started her preface by saying, "As I am engaged in a specialized profession, I cannot speak for society as a whole, but..."

B. Quite—dignified.

A. Yes, up to that point, it was dignified—then came, "Looking at it 'locally' (局部的)..." like Su Qin and Zhang Yi (蘇秦張儀), but with that word 'locally' (局部的), don't you feel a certain impulse?

B. I just receive a sacred inspiration (靈感).

A. Me too. As I came out, I thought. There are plenty of other words like 'partially' (部分的) or 'one-sidedly' (一面的). But really. Why on earth say 'locally' (局部的)? That truly is 'inspirational' (靈感的).<45>

**Summary**

This short piece recounts a humorous anecdote from a banquet attended by prominent men and women. Speaker A describes how a female doctor, formerly a social activist, gave a speech where she used the term "局部的" (kukpubujŏk, meaning "local" or "partial"). Speaker A finds this choice of words amusingly suggestive or "inspirational," especially given the speaker's profession, implying a double entendre related to anatomy, contrasting it with more neutral synonyms like "partially." From a historical perspective, the article offers a glimpse into social gatherings of the Korean elite during the colonial period, touches upon the changing roles of women (a female doctor and former activist), and showcases contemporary humor, language use (including a pun involving Hanja characters), and social commentary, however subtle.
