Peak Period of Genius - Artists

Michelangelo's great ceiling painting of the Sistine Chapel was at age 33.
The "Slave" was at age 35.

Da Vinci's "Francesco" was at age 31.

Raphael's "Vatican Frescoes" were at age 30, the Madonna paintings at age 31.

Millet's "Woman Churning Butter" was at age 30, "The Sower" at age 36.

Rodin's "Nose" was at age 37.<212>

**Summary**

This short article lists several famous Western artists (Michelangelo, Da Vinci, Raphael, Millet, Rodin) and the ages at which they completed some of their major works. The implied theme is that artistic genius often flourishes, or reaches a peak ("全盛期"), during the artist's thirties. For historians studying colonial Korea, this piece reflects the selective adoption and admiration of Western cultural figures and the concept of individual 'genius' during this period, potentially serving as both inspiration and a point of comparison amidst efforts to define Korean modernity and artistic identity under Japanese rule.
