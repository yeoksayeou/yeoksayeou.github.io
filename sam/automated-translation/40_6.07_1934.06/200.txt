Recent Transformations in Chosŏn over 25 Years - (Politics) Changes in Political Systems and Rulers
By Yi Chŏngsŏp

The Residency-General politics can be broadly divided into three periods. This is not meant in the sense that there were three successive Residents-General, but rather, the intent is to divide it into three periods based on the system of Residency-General politics. The first period is the era of Resident-General Itō's politics based on the Five-Point Treaty of the 9th year of Kwangmu (1905). This treaty stipulated the transfer of Korea's diplomatic rights to Japan, and the Residency-General system was also established by this treaty. Article 3, which states, "The Government of Japan shall station under the Korean Emperor's palace one Resident-General. The Resident-General shall reside in Kyŏngsŏng <55> to solely manage diplomatic matters and shall have the right to have a private audience with the Korean Emperor," summarized the entirety of this treaty. As a result of this treaty, Korean legations stationed in Belgium, Qing China, Great Britain, the United States, Germany, Italy, France, Russia, and other countries were all abolished, and the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs took their place. Therefore, from this period, the Resident-General primarily managed Korea's diplomatic affairs, while possessing only the right to advise on internal affairs according to the Japan-Korea Protocol of the 8th year of Kwangmu (1904). At least legally, they did not possess any enforcement power to interfere in internal affairs. Thus, this is referred to as the first period.

In June of the 11th year of Kwangmu (1907), as the attitude of the Japanese government became extremely forceful and the issue of Emperor Kojong's responsibility became intractable, he inevitably reached the point of abdication, passing the throne to Sunjong. The political storm in Korea at this time was swift and precipitous. On July 24th of the same year, a new agreement consisting of seven articles was concluded between Japan and Korea. Through this treaty, Resident-General Itō came to grasp all of Korea's internal administrative power. Consequently, a major change occurred in Korea's political system. Whereas in the era of the Five-Point Treaty, the Resident-General was an organ executing the right to offer advice on internal affairs, placing advisors (顧問) in diplomacy, finance, police affairs, and academic affairs, along with positions like Academic Policy Participation Officer (學政叅政官) and Justice Ministry Participation Officer (法部叅興官), under the Seven-Point Treaty, the Resident-General became the leader of general Korean administration. The enactment of laws and disposition of important administrative matters required the Resident-General's approval, the appointment and dismissal of high-ranking Korean officials required the Resident-General's consent, and furthermore, the Korean government was compelled to appoint Japanese individuals recommended by the Resident-General as Korean officials. For this reason, a major change in the political system was unavoidable. Based on this agreement, Resident-General Itō limited the scope of Japanese officials appointed by the Korean government to the level of Vice-Minister (次官) and below in each ministry, while State Ministers (國務大臣) continued to be appointed from among Koreans. Thus, practical political power henceforth came to be held by the Japanese Vice-Ministers.

Consequently, the governing organs, besides the Resident-General (統監) and Vice Resident-General (副統監), included the Director-General of General Affairs (總務局長官), Participation Officers (叅與官), Director of Foreign Affairs (外務部長), Inspector-General of Police (警視總監), Director of Police Affairs (警務局長), and Chief Tax Officer (總稅務司). In the Ministries of Interior (內部), Agriculture, Commerce, and Industry (農商工部), Education (學部), Imperial Household (宮內府), Finance (度支部), and Justice (法部), one Vice-Minister (次官) was placed in each. These individuals, in their capacity as Participation Officers, participated in the Resident-General's staff meetings internally and executed <56> various administrative tasks externally as Vice-Ministers of their respective departments. And on July 31st of the same year, the imperial edict dissolving the Korean army was promulgated.

On June 15, Meiji 42 (1909), Resident-General Itō resigned his post, returned to Japan, and was appointed Chairman of the Privy Council (樞密院議長). He was succeeded by Vice Resident-General Sone Arasuke, who became Resident-General. Soon after, a treaty was concluded stipulating the entrustment of Korea's judicial and prison affairs to the Japanese government. As a result, Korea's Ministry of Justice (法部) was permanently abolished, and in its place, a new entity called the Residency-General Judicial Office (統監部 司法廳) was established, coming to oversee Korea's courts and prisons.

Resident-General Sone, after only seven months in office, resigned due to an incurable illness. Army General Terauchi Masatake was appointed as the third Resident-General of Korea. Before his arrival, while still in Tōkyō, he issued an order to Ishizuka Eizō, who was then acting Director-General of General Affairs of the Residency-General: "In view of the current situation in Korea, the home government intends to dispatch an additional 1,000 military police (憲兵) to supplement the deficiency in police power and, at the same time, to ensure the complete maintenance of public order, transfer the Korean government's police organs to the Residency-General, and seek unification of police affairs in conjunction with the military police. For this purpose, take sufficient measures to promptly secure the approval of the Korean Prime Minister." Thus, Resident-General Terauchi, before arriving in Korea and while still in Tōkyō, arranged for the entrustment of Korea's police affairs to Japan through the treaty of June 24, Yung-hŭi 4 (1910). As a result, the Korean police system was completely abolished, and a new police system centered on the military police (憲兵本位) was born. According to this system, the Commander of the Military Police stationed in Korea was concurrently appointed as the Inspector-General of Police Affairs (警務總長) of the Residency-General. Police in the capital were placed under the direct control of the Residency-General, and in each province, the system of Police Department Chiefs (警察部長) under an Inspector (警視) was changed, with Military Police unit commanders (憲兵分隊長) concurrently serving as Provincial Police Chiefs (警務部長).

That is, during this period, Korea's administrative power, judicial power, and police power – essentially the entire state power concerning its governance – were transferred to Japan. Together with the transfer of diplomatic power during the first period of Residency-General politics, all that remained for Korea was merely the title of Emperor. Therefore, this period is marked as the second period of Residency-General politics.

It was the day of October 26, Meiji 42 (1909), when the north wind blew mournfully (朔風이 泝瀝한). At the Harbin railway station in Northern Manchuria, Duke Itō was assassinated by An Chunggŭn. With this acting as a fuse, the Korean question became a major concern for both the government and the public in Japan. It became clear that the Japanese government would impose some fundamental solution to the Korean problem. At that time, An Pyŏngjun and Yi Yonggu of the Ilchinhoe (一進會), a major political party in Korea, advocated for Japan-Korea unification (日韓合邦論), but it was not easily resolved. However, after the arrival of the new Resident-General Terauchi <57>, the issue of annexation (倂合問題) materialized. Finally, on August 22, Meiji 43 (Yung-hŭi 4, 1910), the Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty (日韓倂合條約) was concluded between Resident-General Terauchi and Prime Minister Yi Wanyong, bringing Korea to its end. The period from Duke Itō's assassination until this time was entirely dominated by the theory of Japan-Korea unification and the movement for annexation. Therefore, this is designated as the third period of Residency-General politics.

At its conclusion, the ordinance for the Government-General of Chōsen (朝鮮總督府 官制) was implemented, and the third Resident-General, Terauchi, became the first Governor-General (總督) to rule Chōsen. Briefly outlining the ordinance: The Government-General of Chōsen is established in Kyŏngsŏng to govern Chōsen. The Governor-General is appointed by the Emperor (親任), filled by an Army General (陸軍大將), reports directly to the Emperor (天皇), commands the army and navy within the scope of delegated authority, is concurrently responsible for the defense of Chōsen, oversees all political affairs of Chōsen in administration, reports to the throne through the Prime Minister (內閣總理大臣) and receives imperial sanction (裁可). The Political Affairs Superintendent (政務統監) is appointed by the Emperor, assists the Governor-General, manages the internal affairs of the Government-General, and supervises the affairs of each department and bureau. The Government-General has a Governor-General's Secretariat (總督官房) and five departments: General Affairs (總務), Internal Affairs (內務), Finance (度支), Agriculture, Commerce, and Industry (農商工), and Justice (司法), each with a Department Chief (長官). Provincial Governors (道長官) are subordinate to the Governor-General, execute laws and ordinances, manage administrative affairs within their jurisdiction, and are permitted to use police officers within their jurisdiction for the execution of provincial administration, while other police and sanitation affairs are executed by the Provincial Police Chief (道警務部長). Additionally, a Central Council (中樞院) was established as an advisory body to the Governor-General, tasked with investigating matters related to old customs and institutions concerning all of Chōsen.

In October, Taishō 5 (1916), Governor-General Terauchi relinquished his post, and Army General Hasegawa Yoshimichi was appointed as the second Governor-General. In July of the following year, the operations of Chōsen's state-owned railways were entrusted to the South Manchuria Railway Company (南滿洲鐵道株式會社), and a new Railway Bureau (鐵道局) was established within the Governor-General's Secretariat to handle general railway administration and affairs. Soon after, in March, Taishō 8 (1919), Governor-General Hasegawa resigned, taking responsibility for the outbreak of the political movement [March 1st Movement]. Following this, in September of the same year, Navy Admiral Saitō Makoto arrived in Chōsen as the third Governor-General, accompanied by Political Affairs Superintendent Mizuno Rentarō. Governor-General Saitō can be said to have implemented considerable reforms to the political system of the first two Governor-General eras. Listing just a few of the most important changes: first, the Governor-General could be appointed from either civilian or military officials; second, the previous Department Chiefs (部長官) were changed to Bureau Directors (局長), and six bureaus were established: Internal Affairs (內務), Finance (財務), Industry (殖産), Justice (法務), Education (學務), and General Affairs (總務). Additionally, <58> the former Secretariat's General Affairs Bureau (官房總務局) was renamed the Secretariat Department (庶務部), the Public Works Bureau (土木局) to the Public Works Department (土木部), and the Railway Bureau (鐵道局) to the Railway Department (鐵道部). In the local government system, the Provincial Governor (道長官) was renamed Provincial Governor (道知事). The abolition of the much-maligned military police system (憲兵警察制度) and its unification under a civilian police system (文官警察制度) was a significant event among the new political administrative structures. Furthermore, while all assembly and speech were prohibited during the first two Governor-General eras, Governor-General Saitō somewhat relaxed these restrictions, allowing the publication of private newspapers and granting a degree of freedom for assembly, which was a factual development.

Governor-General Saitō also changed the previous policy of centralized rule and initiated the realization of decentralization. This was the so-called Local Autonomy System (地方自治制度) implemented in Taishō 9 (1920). The main points of this Local Autonomy System were: first, the establishment of consultative bodies, Prefectural/Township Councils (府面協議會), in prefectures (府) and townships (面); second, for the general education of Koreans, the establishment of a School Fee System (學校費制度) in prefectures, counties (郡), and islands (島), with School Councils (學敎評議會) as their consultative bodies; and third, the establishment of Provincial Councils (道評議會) as consultative bodies for Provincial Local Expenditures (道地方費).

As Governor-General Saitō was appointed as Japan's Plenipotentiary to the Geneva Disarmament Conference and had to travel there, Army General Ugaki Kazushige served as Acting Governor-General in Saitō's absence during the spring of Shōwa 2 (1927). With the breakdown of the Geneva Disarmament Conference and Governor-General Saitō's return, General Ugaki resigned as Acting Governor-General. However, perhaps finding his eight years of life in Chōsen too tedious, Governor-General Saitō relinquished the Governor-General's seal shortly after returning from Geneva, at the end of Shōwa 2 (1927), and went to Tōkyō. His successor, the fifth Governor-General, was the famous General Yamanashi Hanzō. Since his arrival in early Shōwa 3 (1928), unpleasant rumors circulated, eventually culminating in the outbreak of an unprecedented major corruption scandal (大疑獄事件) centered around Governor-General Yamanashi, which became a criminal matter. Consequently, Governor-General Yamanashi was forced to resign in the latter half of Shōwa 4 (1929). The political system change during Governor-General Yamanashi's era could be considered the reduction of the Governor-General's authority resulting from the establishment of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs (拓務省), passed by both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives in Shōwa 4. That is, until then, the Governor-General of Chōsen reported to the throne and received imperial sanction via the Prime Minister, but was not under the Prime Minister's command and supervision. However, due to the establishment of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, the Governor-General of Chōsen became an administrative official under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Colonial Affairs (拓務大臣). <59>

After Governor-General Yamanashi's resignation, the question of who would succeed him became a major topic of discussion in official circles. Ultimately, the elder Saitō was appointed Governor-General once again. If Governor-General Saitō made any changes to the political system upon returning to Chōsen for the second time, it would be the reform of the Local Autonomy System he had established 10 years prior during his tenure as the third Governor-General. Namely, transforming the previous consultative bodies of Provinces (道), Prefectures (府), and Towns (邑) into deliberative bodies (議決機關), thereby taking another step towards the ideal of local autonomy, and consolidating the three entities of Prefecture (府), School Fees (學校費), and School Association (學校組合) into the Prefecture – these two points were the key aspects of the revision, and this is also the current system.

When Governor-General Saitō resigned in early Shōwa 6 (1931), Army General Ugaki Kazushige, who was often named whenever there was a political upheaval as a "planet" of the central political world, perhaps due to some change of heart, turned his back on the central political stage and assumed the post of Governor-General of Chōsen, where he remains to this day. It has been a little over three years since Governor-General Ugaki came to Chōsen. During that time, changes to the governing administrative structure include separating the Agriculture Section (農務課) within the Industry Bureau (殖産局) to establish a new Agriculture and Forestry Bureau (農林局), abolishing the Finance Directors (財務部長) in each province, establishing Tax Supervision Bureaus (稅務監督局) in five locations – Kyŏngsŏng, P'yŏngyang, Taegu, Kwangju, and Hamhŭng – and further establishing 99 Tax Offices (稅務署) under them. Besides these, new systems like the Farmland Ordinance (農地令) and Income Tax Ordinance (所得稅令) have emerged, but since they are outside the purely political sphere, there is no need to discuss them.

**Summary**

This 1934 article by Yi Chŏngsŏp meticulously traces the evolution of Japanese political control over Korea from the establishment of the Residency-General in 1905 following the Protectorate Treaty, through the annexation in 1910, and up to the governorship of Ugaki Kazushige in 1934. It divides the Residency-General period into three phases based on the progressive stripping of Korean sovereignty: first, control over diplomacy (1905); second, control over internal administration, judiciary, and police (1907-1910); and third, the period leading directly to annexation driven by the assassination of Itō Hirobumi (1909-1910). The article then details the structure of the Government-General under successive Governors-General (Terauchi, Hasegawa, Saitō, Yamanashi, Saitō again, Ugaki), noting key administrative changes like the shift from military to civilian police (under Saitō), the introduction and later reform of a limited local autonomy system, the establishment of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs reducing the Governor-General's direct line to the Emperor, and bureaucratic reorganizations like the creation of the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau and Tax Supervision Bureaus under Ugaki.

For historians, this article offers a contemporary Korean perspective (albeit published under censorship) on the period's political shifts, systematically outlining the institutional mechanisms of Japanese colonial rule and the gradual tightening of control. Its periodization of the Residency-General era and detailed account of administrative restructuring, including specific treaties, ordinances, and personnel changes (listing key Japanese and Korean figures), provide valuable insights into the framework and evolution of colonial governance. The mention of Saitō's "cultural policy" reforms (allowing newspapers, reforming police, local councils) and subsequent centralizations/bureaucratic shifts reflects the changing strategies of Japanese rule.

最近朝鮮의 轉變 25年間- (政治) 政治制度와 統治者의 變動
						李晶燮
統監政治를 大畧 3期로 나늘수 잇슬 것이다. 그것은 결코 統監이 3代를 繼續하엿다는 意味에서 아니라 統監政治의 制度로 보아 3期로 나느고저 함이다. 第1期는 光武 9年의 5個條約에 의한 伊藤統監의 政治時代이다. 이 條約은 韓國의 外交權을 日本에 讓渡한다는 것으로서 統監制가 創始되기도 또한 이 條約에서이니 그 제3조인 『日本國 政府는 그 代表者로서 韓國皇帝陛下의 闕下에 一名의 統監을 置함. 統監은 전혀 外交에 관한 事項을 管理하기 위하야 京城에<55> 駐在하며 친히 韓國皇帝陛下에 內謁하는 權利를 有함』은 이 條約의 全貌를 要約한 것이엇다. 이 條約의 結果로 白耳義, 淸國, 英國, 米國, 獨逸, 伊太利, 佛蘭西, 露西亞 及 그 외 諸國에 駐在하는 韓國公使舘은 全部 撤廢되고 日本外務省이 그에 代하게 되엿다. 그럼으로 이 時代로부터 統監은 주로 韓國의 外交事務를 專管하는 同時에 光武 8年의 日韓議定書에 의하야 內政에 대한 忠告權을 가저슬 따름이오. 적어도 法的으로 內政에 關涉하는 엇더한 强行權을 가젓든 것은 아니엇다. 그럼으로 이것을 제1기라 함이다.

光武 11年 6月에 日本政府의 態度가 몹시 强硬한 同時에 高宗께옵서의 責任問題가 容易치 안어 드듸어 退位하는 不得已에 이르서 그 位를 純宗에게 繼承시키시엇다. 이 때의 韓國政界風雲은 急轉直下的이어서 仝年 7月 24日 日韓兩國間에 7個條로 된 新協約이 締結되엿스니 이 條約으로 말미아마 伊藤統監은 韓國의 內政權 一切를 掌握하게 되엿다. 그러므로 따러서 韓國의 政治制度에 一大變化가 이러낫스니 그것은 5條約時代에는 統監은 內政에 대한 忠言權을 執行하는 機關으로 外交, 財政, 警務, 學務에 顧問을 두웟고 그 외에 學政叅政官과 法部叅興官가튼 것이 잇서슬 따름이더니 7條約에 의하야 統監이 韓國施政一般의 指導者가 되어 法令의 制定과 重要行政上의 處分은 統監의 承認을 經하여야 하며 韓國高等官吏의 任免은 統監의 同意를 어더야 하며 더구나 韓國政府는 統監이 推薦하는 日本人을 韓國官吏로 任命하게 된 까닭에 여긔에 政治制度上 大變化가 생기지 안을 수 업섯든 것이다. 이 協約에 의하야 伊藤統監은 韓國政府의 日本人官吏任命의 範圍를 各部 次官 以下에 止케 하고 國務大臣은 依然히 韓國人으로써 任命하게 하엿스니 政治上 實權은 自此로 日本人次官이 掌握하게 되엿다.
그리하야 統治機關으로는 統監 及 副統監 外에 總務局長官, 叅與官, 外務部長, 警視總監, 警務局長, 總稅務司며 內部, 農商工部, 學部, 宮內府, 度支部, 法部 等 各部에 次官1名식을 두어 이들은 叅與官의 資格으로 入하여는 統監의 帷幕에 叅하며 出하여는 各部 次官으로<56> 諸般行政을 執行하기로 되엿섯다. 그리고 同年 7月 31日 韓國軍隊의 解散詔勅이 喚發되엿다.
明治 42年 6月 15日 伊藤統監은 職을 辭하고 歸國하야 樞密院議長으로 任命된 뒤를 이어 副統監 曾禰荒助가 統監이 되어서 未久에 韓國政府의 司法 及 監獄事務를 日本政府에 委任한다는 條約이 成立되엇슴으로 韓國의 法部는 永久히 廢止되고 그 대신 새로 統監部 司法廳이라는 것이 設立되어 韓國의 裁判所 及 監獄을 統轄하기에 이르럿다.
曾禰統監은 在任한지 겨우 7個月에 不治의 病으로 드듸어 辭職하고 陸軍大將 寺內正毅가 第3世 韓國統監으로 赴任하게 되매 그는 東京에서 當時의 統監部 總務長官事務取扱 石塚英藏에게 『韓國의 現時狀勢에 鑑하야 本國政府는 憲兵 1,000名을 增派하야 警察力의 不足을 補하는 同時에 治安의 維持를 完全히 하기 위하야 韓國政府의 警察機關을 統監部로 옴기며 憲兵과 相合하야 警察事務의 統一을 圖코저 하노라. 이 目的으로써 韓國內閣總理大臣에게 속히 承認시컬 充分한 手段을 取하라는 命令을 發하엿다. 그리하야 寺內統監은 赴任前 東京에 안저서 隆熙 4年 6月 24日의 條約으로 韓國의 警察事務를 日本에 委任시키엇다. 그 結果로 韓國警察官制는 全廢되고 憲兵本位의 新警察制度가 出生한 바 그에 의하면 韓國駐剳憲兵司令官으로 하여금 統監部 警務總長을 兼任케 하야 首府의 警察은 統監部의 直轄로 하고 各道에는 輕視의 警察部長制를 改하야 憲兵分隊長으로써 警務部長을 兼任케 하엿다.
즉 이 時期에 잇서서는 韓國의 行政權, 司法權 及 警察權 等이 其政에 관한 國權全部가 日本에 讓渡되어 統監政治 제1기의 外交權讓渡와 함게 韓國에 나마잇다는 것은 다만 皇帝의 稱號뿐이엇슴으로 이 時期를 劃하야 統監政治의 제2기라 하는 바이다.

그것은 朔風이 泝瀝한 明治 42年 10月 26日의 일이엇다. 北滿洲 哈爾賓 停車場에서 伊藤公이 安重根에게 被弑되매 이것을 導火線으로 韓國問題가 日本 朝野의 一大 關心事가 되어 日本政府는 韓國問題에 엇더한 根本的 解決을 내릴 것이 分明하게 되자 當時 韓國의 一大 政黨이든 一進會의 安秉畯. 及 李容九 等이 日韓合邦論을 提唱하엿스나 容易히 解決되지 못하다가 新統監 寺內가 赴任한<57> 뒤로는 合倂問題가 具體化하야 드듸어 明治 43年 (隆熙 4年) 8月 22日 寺內統監과 總理大臣 李完用 間에 日韓倂合條約이 成立되어 이로써 韓國은 그 最後를 告하게 되엿다. 이와 갓틔 伊藤公의 被殺로부터 이 時期에 이르는 동안은 純全히 日韓合邦論과 倂合運動으로 終始하엿슴으로 이것을 統監政治의 제3기라 하여 두는 것이다

그 끗헤 朝鮮總督府 官制가 實施되어 제3대 統監 寺內는 제1대 總督으로서 朝鮮을 統治하게 되엇다. 이제 그 官制를 畧記하여 보면 朝鮮總督府를 京城에 置하야 朝鮮을 管轄케 함. 總督은 親任으로 하야 陸軍大將으로써 此에 充하며 天皇에 직예하야 委任의 範圍 내에서 陸海軍을 統率케 하고 兼하 朝鮮防備의 事를 掌하며 行政上에 잇서서는 朝鮮諸般의 政務를 統轄하며 內閣總理大臣을 經하야 上奏하며 또는 裁可를 바드며 政務統監은 親任으로 하야 總督을 輔佐하며 府內를 統理하며 各部局의 事務를 管督함. 總督府에는 總督官房 及 總務, 內務, 度支, 農商工 及 司法의 5部를 置하야 各部에 長官을 置하며 道長官은 總督에 예속하야 法令을 執行하며 管內의 行政事務를 管理하며 道行政의 執行에 관하야는 管內의 警察官을 使用함을 得하되 그 他의 警察 及 衛生事務는 道警務部長으로써 執行케 한다는 것이엇다. 이 外에 總督의  諮問機關으로 中樞院을 設하며 全部 朝鮮에 대한 舊慣 及 制度에 관한 事項을 調査케 하기로 하엿다.

大正 5年 10月에 寺內總督이 그 印綬를 解하매 陸軍大將 長谷川好道가 제2대 總督으로 就任하야 그 翌年 7月에 朝鮮의 國有鐵道의 業務를 南滿洲鐵道株式會社에 委任하고 새로히 總督官房에 鐵道局을 設하야 鐵道에 관한 行政 及 事務에 一般을 處理케 하엿다. 이윽고 大正 8年 3月에 長谷川總督은 政治運動勃發의 責任을 지고 辭職한 後 同年 9月에 第3代 總督으로 海軍大將 齊藤實이 政務統監 水野練太郞을 伴하야 朝鮮에 赴任하엿다. 齊藤總督은 前2代總督時代의 政治制度에 相當한 改革을 加하엿다고 할 수 잇는 것이니 이제 그 中에서 가장 重要한 몃 가지만 들어 말하기로 하면 첫재 總督의 任用을 文武官 中에서 何者이나 任用하게 한 것과 둘재로는 從來의 各部長官을 改하야 局長으로 하고 內務, 財務, 殖産, 法務, 學務, 總務의 6局을 置하기로 되엿다. 이 外에<58> 從來의 官房總務局을 庶務部로 土木局을 土木部로 鐵道局을 鐵道部로 改稱하엿고 地方官制에 잇서서는 道長官을 道知事라 하엿스며 말성만튼 憲兵警察制度를 撤廢하고 文官警察制度로써 統一한 것은 新政治職制가운데 한 重要事件이라 할 것이다. 그리고 前2代 總督時代에는 一切의 集會와 言論을 禁하엿든 것을 齊藤總督이 비로소 多少 緩和하야 民間新聞이 發刊되는 外에 集會도 어느 만큼 自由롭게 된 것이 事實이엇다.
齊藤總督은 또한 從來의 中央集權的 統治方針을 變改하야 地方分權의 實現에 着手하엿스니 그것이 이른바 大正 9年에 實施된 地方自治制度라는 것이다. 이 地方自治制度의 主眼點은 첫재 府面에 諮問機關인 府面協議會를 둔 것 둘재 朝鮮人의 普通敎育을 위하야 府郡島에 學校費制度를 設하야 그 諮問機關으로 學敎評議會를 설치하엿스며 셋재 道地方費에 諮問機關인 道評議會를 둔 것 等이라 할 것이다.

齊藤總督이 『제네바』軍縮會議의 日本全權으로 被命되어 彼地로 가게 된 關係上 昭和 2年 春에 陸軍大將 宇垣一成이 臨時代理總督으로 齊藤總督의 不在中 椅子에 잇다가 『제네바』軍縮會議 破裂로 齊藤總督의 歸任과 함게 宇垣大將은 臨時代理總督을 辭免하엿스나 齊藤總督이 亦 8年間의 朝鮮生活이 너무 支離햇는 모냥인지 『제네바』에서 歸任後 未久 즉 昭和 2年末에 總督의 印綬를 解하고 東京으로 갓섯다. 그 뒤를 이여 온 第5世 總督이 有名한 山梨半造大將이엇다. 昭和 3年初에 赴任한 以來 들리는 消聞이 매우 滋味스럽지 못하더니 끗끗내 朝鮮空前의 大疑獄事件이 山梨總督을 中心으로 突發하야 刑事問題化하게 되매 山梨總督은 昭和 4年 後半期에 辭任하는 不得已에 이르럿다. 山梨總督時代의 政治制度上 變更이라면 昭和 4年의 貴衆兩院을 通過한 拓務省의 設置로 말미아마 總督의 權限이 縮小된 그것이라 할 것이다. 즉 以前까지는 朝鮮總督은 內閣總理大臣을 經由하야 上奏하며 裁可를 마틀 뿐이오. 總理大臣의 指揮監督을 밧는 것이 아니엿스나 拓務省이 設置된 까닭에 朝鮮總督은 1個 事務官으로 拓務大臣의 管轄下에 서게 되엿다는<59> 그것이다.

山梨總督 退任 후에 누가 오느냐 하는 것이 當時의 官邊의 一大話題이드니 結局 齊藤翁이 다시금 總督으로 赴任하게 되엿다. 齊藤總督이 제2차로 朝鮮 와서 政治制度에 엇더한 變更을 加하엿다면 그것은 그가 10年 前 제3대 總督으로 在任中 創設한 地方自治制度를 다시 改革한 그것을 들어 말할 것이다. 즉 從來의 道, 府, 邑의 諮問機關을 議決機關으로 하야 地方自治의 理想에 한거름 더 나아갓다는 것과 府, 學校費, 學校組合의 3團體를 府에 統一시킨 等 이 두가지가 改正의 要點이오. 또한 現行制度이다.
齊藤總督이 昭和 6年初에 辭任하메 中央政界의 惑星으로 政變 잇슬 때마다 指名되든 陸軍大將宇垣一成이 무슨 心境의 變化로인지 中央政治舞臺를 등지고 朝鮮總督으로 就任하야 아직 까지도 그 任에 잇다. 宇垣總督이 朝鮮 온 지 3年 하고도 조금 더 된다. 그 동안 統治의 職制變更으로서는 殖産局內의 農務課를 獨立시키어 農林局을 新設한 것과 各道의 財務部長을 廢止하고 京城, 平壤, 大邱, 光州, 咸興의 5個所에 稅務監督局올 設하고 다시 그 아래에 99個의 稅務署를 設한 그것이리라. 이 外에 農地令이라 所得稅令 等 새로 나온 制度가 잇스나 그는 純政治 範圍 박김으로 말할 必要가 업슬 것이다.
