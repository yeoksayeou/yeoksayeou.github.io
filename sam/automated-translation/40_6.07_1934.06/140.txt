A. The dead Yi Kwan-yong, the living Yi Kwan-gu. You know about the time Paek Nam-un and others organized the Chosŏn Education Research Association (朝鮮敎育硏究會), right?

B. Know about it? Of course, years ago.

A. Well then, the Government-General (總督府)...

B. Did they get research funds? They certainly should have. It's different from other things, being education research. Even pottery research in Hoeryŏng gets research funds. How much more so!

A. Hold on. Listen to everything first before you chatter.

B. Alright then, hurry up and chatter first.

A. The Government-General, you see, apparently gave them a scolding, saying, "For the education of the Chosŏn people, the Bureau of Educational Affairs (學務局) has already been established, and the Imperially Appointed Director (勅任局長) and his subordinates are researching and implementing facilities day and night. What more research is needed? You must have other intentions."

B. Then that Association also belonged to the "famous but useless" (有名無實) faction, I see.

A. Yes, you chattered that part correctly.<44>

**Summary**

This short dialogue discusses the fate of the Chosŏn Education Research Association, founded by Paek Nam-un and others. While one speaker initially assumes such an organization would receive funding, the other reveals that the Japanese Government-General discouraged it, questioning its necessity given the existing colonial Bureau of Educational Affairs and implying suspicion of subversive motives. The association ultimately became ineffective, dismissed as "famous but useless." For historians, this piece offers a glimpse into the colonial suppression of independent Korean initiatives, particularly in the sensitive area of education, highlighting the authorities' distrust and control over Korean intellectual activities. The comparison with funded pottery research underscores the political nature of the restrictions.
