The Peak Period of Geniuses - Musicians
Beethoven (배-도폔) composed the "Moonlight Sonata" (月光曲) at age 32. Wagner (와구넬)'s "The Flying Dutchman" (뛰어가는 오란드 사람) was at age 31.
Weber (웨바-)'s "Der Freischütz" (自由射手) was at age 35.<213>

**Summary**

This short article lists the ages at which three famous Western composers—Beethoven, Wagner, and Weber—composed some of their significant works, positioning these ages as part of their "peak period" or "golden age." From a historical perspective, the article demonstrates the introduction and reception of Western classical music in colonial Korea during the 1930s. The specific Korean transliterations used for the composers' names and the translated titles of their works offer insight into linguistic and cultural adaptation during that era.
