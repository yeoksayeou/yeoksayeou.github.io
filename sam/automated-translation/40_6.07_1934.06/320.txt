Looking Down on Dongting Lake
						Meng Haoran

In the eighth month, the lake's surface is level,
Embracing the void, blending with the vast clarity.
Vapors steam up from the Yunmeng Marsh,
Waves shake Yueyang City.
I wish to cross, but have no boat or oars,
Living idly, I feel ashamed in this wise reign.
Sitting, watching the anglers cast their lines,
I have only the feeling of envying the fish. <69>

**Summary**

This article presents the classical Chinese poem "Looking Down on Dongting Lake" by the Tang Dynasty poet Meng Haoran. The poem describes the vastness of Dongting Lake in autumn, contrasting the impressive natural scene with the poet's personal feelings of inadequacy and frustrated ambition – his desire to serve the state but lack of opportunity, symbolized by wanting to cross the lake without a boat. For historians studying colonial Korea, the inclusion of this specific Tang poem in a popular magazine like *Samch'ŏlli* might be interesting. It reflects the continued high regard for classical Chinese literature within Korean culture during this period, but the poem's themes of feeling powerless and unable to act ('wishing to cross but having no boat') could perhaps have resonated subtly with Korean intellectuals facing limitations under Japanese rule.
