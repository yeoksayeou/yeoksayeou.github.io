**Summary**

This collection of four poems, titled "Thoughts/Impressions," presents reflections from four different authors in 1934 Korea. Pak Hanyŏng contemplates the enduring spirit of Korea (Samch'ŏlli) and the power of enlightenment. Hyŏn Sangyun expresses personal weariness and disillusionment with the contemporary world, contrasting it with an idealized past. Hwagok Yun Iksŏn offers a broader historical and geopolitical perspective, discussing cycles of rise and fall, the struggle for survival, reliance vs. self-reliance, and the global power dynamics between Asia and Europe ("yellow and white pieces"). Hyangsan reflects on modernity (cinema), the difficulty of discerning truth, the passage of time marked by nature (Han River, Pugaksan, Rose of Sharon), and perhaps a critique of oppression ("violent man"). For historians, the poems are valuable as expressions of Korean intellectual sentiment during the colonial period. They use classical forms and natural imagery, possibly as a means of subtle commentary on national identity (Samch'ŏlli,槿花), the changing times, feelings of powerlessness (他力依), and critiques of the current state (世態粉粉, 暴人) under Japanese rule, while also engaging with broader global contexts (亞歐).
