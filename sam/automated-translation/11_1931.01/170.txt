According to an investigation by the Government-General Police Affairs Bureau (總督府警務局), the total number of individuals within Korea (朝鮮) classified as thought movement activists (思想運動者) who must definitely be monitored, designated as 'People Requiring Observation' (要視察人), is 10,085 as of recently. It is said that this number increases year by year (年年히). <43>

**Summary**

This short news brief reports that, according to the Japanese Government-General Police Affairs Bureau, there were 10,085 individuals in Korea designated as "People Requiring Observation" due to their involvement in "thought movements" as of late 1930. The article notes that this number is reportedly increasing annually. For historians, this piece provides a concrete figure illustrating the scale of Japanese colonial surveillance targeting perceived political dissidents (communists, nationalists, etc.) in Korea during this period. The increasing number points to both growing resistance or activism and the intensifying efforts of the colonial state to monitor and control the population.
