The Departing Great Concession
						Kim Tong-jin

The fishery of His Highness Prince Yi Kang (now the household of Prince Yi Kŏn) in T'ongyŏng, South Kyŏngsang Province, is said to be the finest in Korea, but it has long been leased to Mr. Kashii, a Japanese merchant in Pusan. It is well known that obtaining the lease for this fishery became the foundation of Mr. Kashii's success, allowing him to acquire millions in gold. However, the lease period for the fishery expired on May 1st of this year. The Office of the Yi Royal Family (Riōshoku), having leased it out cheaply, planned to reclaim it on this occasion and contract with a fishery operator who would pay an appropriate lease fee, rejecting Mr. Kashii's request to renew the contract at the same low price. However (Omission - original text) [...] the mediation of various gentlemen ultimately resulted in the rights being transferred back to Mr. Kashii. It was settled that Mr. Kashii would acquire the fishing district for the low price of 528,000 wŏn, to be repaid over 10 years without interest. Regarding this contract, the household of Prince Yi Kŏn expressed dissatisfaction, stating it was not their intention but due to coercion from certain quarters (某方面), and filed petitions in Tokyo. Indeed, the office of Prince Yi Kŏn's household had even placed newspaper advertisements announcing a public auction, only to be forced to retract the statement, utterly losing face and drawing public suspicion and XX. What could be the cause of such turmoil surrounding this major fishery?

Mr. Kashii Sits and Feasts
Regarding the history of this fishery, it is said that 24 years ago, an entrepreneur named Kim Pong-su paid a lease fee of 500,000 *ryang* to the Imperial Household Department (宮內府 - Kunai-fu) according to the Department's wishes and obtained the rights to manage the fishery. This is Mr. Kim Pong-su's account. According to the Office of the Yi Royal Family, in August of the 10th year of Kwangmu (1906), Emperor Kojong granted the T'ongyŏng fishery to his beloved son, Prince Ŭich'in (Yi Kang), and appointed Kim Pong-su as the fishery supervisor. In any case, as Prince Ŭich'in's household was not in a position to manage the fishery directly, and with the strong urging of Resident-General Itō-kō (伊藤公), the entire 72 sections of the fishery were leased to Mr. Kashii for the small annual sum of 15,000 wŏn. Then, in the 9th year of Taishō (1920), when the lease expired, 43 sections were returned to Prince Yi Kang's household, 1 section was cancelled due to the laying of submarine cables, and only the remaining 28 sections continued to be managed by Mr. Kashii. Although the fishing area was reduced compared to before, the lease fee was also lowered by 2,500 wŏn. At that time (Omission - original text) [...] some objected, arguing that the 43 returned sections were only poor fishing grounds, while the 28 sections retained by Mr. Kashii were the excellent ones, making a reduction in the lease fee inappropriate. However, Bureau of Industry (殖産局 - Shokusankyoku) Director Nishimura-shi (西村氏) stated that the division was done most fairly based on area.
However, the "fairness" declared by Mr. Nishimura was exposed in just a few days. Of the 43 returned sections, 13 inevitably had to be transferred to the Anchovy Cooperative (멜치組合) for a meager annual lease fee of only 200 wŏn, 3 sections were discontinued as their value as fishing grounds was lost, and only the remaining 27 sections were directly leased out, but the income remained poor. <35>

Operating Only the Prime Fishing Grounds
Mr. Kashii, having secured the core 28 fishing sections, personally operated only the 9 most excellent ones among them and sublet the remaining 17 sections to others. The fee for this subletting was the large sum of 400 wŏn per year [per section? Text unclear, seems low if total]. After deducting the 12,500 wŏn paid to the Office of the Yi Royal Family, the remaining net profit of 27,500 wŏn [from subletting?] and the income from the 9 directly operated sections became pure earnings. How much were those earnings exactly? As the calculations are kept secret, the precise amount cannot be known, but rumor has it that the annual income from just 2 of the directly operated fishing grounds was 400,000 wŏn, suggesting it was easily no less than 1,000,000 wŏn [likely total annual income intended]. Thus, Mr. Kashii, with these "special privilege" rights, had an income exceeding 1,000,000 wŏn annually. So, how much profit did he really make over the past approximately 20 years? In any case, could it be mere coincidence that Mr. Kashii, who started with clenched fists, also made contributions to the Seiyūkai (政友?) and others, reaching a point where even respectable Governors couldn't hold their heads up around him?

The Princely Household's 1,000,000 Wŏn Plan
One million wŏn annually! For 20 years, that's 20 million wŏn. Finally, the contract term expired, and from May 1st of this year, it returned to the ownership of Prince Yi Kŏn's household. The office of Prince Yi Kŏn's household, having been in an unfair situation for many years, though perhaps not to the point of grinding their teeth in fury, decided to use this opportunity of contract renewal to permanently transfer (for 10 years in fishery terms) the fishery if an amount sufficient to become the household's basic assets was paid. They intended to acknowledge Mr. Kashii's established connection (緣故權) and conduct a negotiated contract (隨意契約), even encouraging Mr. Kashii to acquire it for a fair price. However, Mr. Kashii played hard to get and showed no sincerity, so the princely household decided to put it up for general bidding, placed advertisements in various newspapers, and even sent bidding documents to provincial, county, and township offices to facilitate bidders' convenience.

Mr. Kashii's Underhanded Maneuvers
Mr. Kashii, who had been complacent thinking the princely household couldn't do much no matter how they resisted, was shocked like being struck by lightning upon discovering the advertisement for a general auction. He mobilized the Governor of South Kyŏngsang Province, Mr. Tani (谷氏?), and also visited high officials at the Government-General (總督府), engaging in extensive activity. As a result, Governor Tani ordered the provincial, county, and township offices under his jurisdiction to halt the handling of the bidding-related documents distributed by the princely household. He also personally traveled to Keijō (Seoul), visited the Governor-General, the Vice Governor-General (總監), and the Director of the Bureau of Industry, collaborating with Mr. Kashii and exerting utmost effort to cancel the general auction and secure a renewed contract for Mr. Kashii. However, Director of the Bureau of Industry Matsumura (松村殖産局長) remained silent, stating there was no need to interfere, and Governor-General Saitō (齋藤總督) acted as if it didn't concern him, entrusting the resolution entirely to (Omission - original text) [likely the Vice Governor-General]. Thus, the giant of Japanese commerce finally secured the backing of Mr. XX [likely the Vice Governor-General]. (Omission - original text) [The Vice Governor-General?] summoned Vice-Minister Shinoda (篠田李王職次官) of the Office of the Yi Royal Family, and after several days of "cordial discussions" (懇談?), the outcome was that the 12 disputed fishing sections were transferred from the hands of Prince Ŭich'in's household to Mr. Kashii's ownership for the sum of 528,080 wŏn, to be repaid in installments over 10 years.

A Huge Bargain of 260,000 Wŏn
While 528,000 wŏn might seem like a huge amount, it's not a lump sum but repaid in annual installments over 10 years, meaning only 52,800 wŏn needs to be paid each year. Furthermore, the annual interest on 528,000 wŏn, even estimated conservatively at 5% (5分), would be 26,500 wŏn per year. If interest were added, it means Mr. Kashii acquired rights yielding over 5 million wŏn annually (totaling 50 million over 10 years?) for merely about 26,000 wŏn per year, or 260,000 wŏn over 10 years [Note: calculation seems off in original, likely means principal paid is effectively halved by lack of interest]. On the other hand, what became of the princely household's finances? The household, lacking sufficient funds, had planned to establish a 100-year financial foundation this time, needing to generate at least one million wŏn in a lump sum from that fishery. That plan shrank to an annual income of 36,000 wŏn [miscalculation in original? 52,800 seems the annual payment], making their situation too pitiful to even mention.

Princely Household Officials Hastily Travel to Tokyo
Why then did the princely household have no choice but to submit to this unfair contract? Officials from the princely household, Mr. Ikejiri (池尻氏), an administrative officer, and Advisor Maeda Shōshō (前田小將), sensing the urgency of the situation due to the frequent summons of Vice-Minister Shinoda by (Omission - original text) [the Vice Governor-General?], hastily left Keijō (Seoul) to seek a final decision from His Highness Prince Yi Kŏn, arriving in Tokyo on August 31st. His Highness was at Narashino (習志野) due to military exercises. As it was a Sunday, the two officials expected him to return to his residence. While waiting, an urgent telegram arrived at the Tokyo residence office. <36> It was none other than a message stating that a negotiated contract for the 12 fishing sections had been concluded with Mr. Kashii for 528,000 wŏn, and they should return to Keijō immediately. Seeing this, the two officials gnashed their teeth and wrung their hands, not knowing what to do. Just then, His Highness returned to the residence. When informed of the matter, His Highness, though young, was astute in reasoning and declared he could not approve such an unfavorable contract, showing his displeasure. Until 7 PM, His Highness asked the two officials various questions, clearly distressed, but time ran out, and he had to return to Narashino. The next day, the two officials visited the Director of the Imperial Household Bureau (皇室寮總裁) at the Ministry of the Imperial Household (宮內省) and explained the entire sequence of events leading to the disadvantageous contract signing, then immediately returned [to Keijō].

The Agony of Prince Yi Kŏn's Household

When the news spread that such a favorable contract for the lessee had been signed, the lessees of 8 fishing sections who were supposed to get negotiated contracts due to prior connections, and the potential lessees for the 18 sections put up for general auction, demanded that the princely household grant them the same terms as Mr. Kashii. Not being hagglers at a night market, selling everything off like that would mean losing even the principal. The princely household, utterly dismayed, could only respond with the single statement, "This matter is not the responsibility of this household; make your demands to the Government-General."

What is the Hidden Story?
The fishery affair, expected to cause continuous waves, was settled favorably for Mr. Kashii, seemingly due to the mediation of the Government-General, leaving no other option. But was it truly necessary to rush and conclude the contract so hastily, unable even to wait while the princely household officials were away in Tokyo? This suggests there was a need to settle the matter before the officials' report could reach His Highness. While Vice-Minister Shinoda, known as a man of considerable integrity (相當한 硬骨漢), is unlikely to have blindly stamped (盲印) a contract contrary to reason, regulations stipulated that officials of the Office of the Yi Royal Family residing in Korea were subject to the supervision of the Korean Governor-General. If he lacked the courage to risk his position, he might have had no choice but to comply silently. Furthermore, rumor has it that the Vice Governor-General used certain conditions related to the retirement (隱退) of Prince Yi Kang as leverage to pressure the Office of the Yi Royal Family. There's also talk that a clause was inserted promising "due consideration" if Prince Yi Kŏn's household finances become impoverished in the future. However, for the highest authorities to exert such significant effort merely to resolve a commercial relationship between a single merchant and the princely household is something ordinary people find hard to comprehend. —(End)— <37>

**Summary**

This 1931 article details the controversial transfer of lucrative fishing rights in T'ongyŏng, originally granted to Prince Yi Kang (later inherited by Prince Yi Kŏn), to a Japanese merchant, Kashii. Despite the Yi household's attempt to secure a fair market price via public auction after the lease expired, alleged pressure from high-ranking Japanese colonial officials, including the Governor of South Kyŏngsang and potentially the Vice Governor-General, forced the Office of the Yi Royal Family (Riōshoku) to sell the rights back to Kashii for a significantly undervalued price (528,000 wŏn) payable over 10 years without interest. The Yi household viewed this as coerced and financially detrimental, while Kashii stood to make enormous profits. The article highlights the powerlessness of the former Korean royalty and the mechanisms of economic exploitation under Japanese rule.

For historians, this article is significant as it provides a contemporary account of the economic disenfranchisement of the Yi royal family, illustrating how colonial power structures facilitated the transfer of valuable Korean assets (大利權 - great concessions) to Japanese individuals. It reveals the direct intervention of high-level colonial administration (Government-General, Provincial Governor) in favor of a Japanese merchant against the interests of the Korean elite, suggesting a blend of political pressure and economic opportunism characteristic of the colonial period. The mention of potential leverage related to Prince Yi Kang's earlier abdication adds another layer to the political maneuvering involved.

						金東進
慶南 統營의 李堈殿下(지금은 李鍵公家)漁場은 優秀하기로 朝鮮에 第一이라 하나 일즉부터 釜山의 一政商 香椎氏에게 貸與되야 香椎氏는 이 漁場의 貸附를 어든 것이 성공의 기초가 되여 數百萬의 황금을 획득하엿다 함은 세상이 밝히 아는 것이다. 그런데 그 漁場의 貸附期間이 금년 5월 1일을 限하여 끈허지매 李王職에서는 염가에 대부하엿든 것을 이 기회에 회수하여 적당한 貸附料를 납부하는 漁業家와 계약할 계획을 세우고 如前히 염가로 재계약을 신청한 香椎씨의 요구를 거절하여 버렷다. 그러나(中略-원문) 諸氏의 居中調定은 필경 香椎씨에게 다시 권리를 넘길 수 밧게 업시 되야 香椎씨는 그 漁區를 528,000원 10개년 無利子償還이라는 염가로 讓受하기로 낙착되엿는데 이러한 계약에 대하여 李鍵公家에서는 이것은 自意가 아니고 某方面의 강압이라 하여 東京 방면으로 진정을 하는 등 불평을 표시하엿다. 사실 李鍵公家 사무소에서는 一般公買에 부친다는 광고까지 新聞紙에 게재하엿다가 그 聲明을 철회할 수 밧게 업섯스니 그 體面은 여지업시 실추하여 世人의 疑訝와 XX를 사게 되엿스니 大漁場을 중심으로 이와 가튼 파란을 이르키게 된 원인은 무엇일가.

香椎氏坐而飽食
이 漁場의 연혁을 말하면 距今 24년 전 당시의 기업가 金鳳洙라는 사람이 宮內府의 內意대로 50萬兩이라는 貸料를 宮內府에 납부하고 그 漁場경영권을 어덧다고 한다. 이것은 金鳳洙씨의 立論이어니와 李王職의 말을 드르면 光武 10년 8월에 高宗께서는 사랑하시는 아드님인 義親王께 統營漁場을 下賜하시고 金鳳洙로 하여금 漁場감독을 임명하엿다고 한다. 하여튼 義親王宮께서는 그 漁場을 自營할 수가 업는 處地이엇슴으로 맛츰 統監伊藤公의 勸請도 유력하여 香椎씨에게 漁場 72區 전부를 貸與하엿는데 貸附料는 年額 15,000원이라는 少額이엿다. 그러다가 大正 9년에 그 貸附기한이 종료되는 동시에 43個所는 李堈家에 반환되고 1個所는 海底電線敷設관계로 취소되고 남아지 28個所만 다시 香椎씨가 계속 경영하게 되엿다. 이전보다 漁區가 축소되엿슴으로 貸附料도 2,500원을 減下하엿스나 당시(中略-원문)에서는 반환한 43區는 不良한 漁場뿐이오 香椎씨가 차지한 28個所가 우수한데 貸附料를 減下함이 不可하다고 반대하엿스나 殖産局長 西村씨는 가장 公正히 區域적으로 분할하엿다는 聲明을 하엿다.
그러나 西村씨의 聲明한「公正」이 불과 數日에 폭로되엿스니 반환된 43個所중 13個所는 부득이 멜치組合에 讓渡할 수 밧게 업서 겨우 年額 200원의 貸附料를 바들 수 밧게 업섯고 또3個所는 漁區의 가치가 喪失되여 中止되고 그 남아지 27個所만 직접 貸與하엿스나 역시 收入이 신통치 못하엿다.＜35＞

優良漁場만 自營
알맹이 28個區의 漁場을 차지한 香椎씨는 其中에서도 優良한 9個所만 自營하고 殘餘의 17個所는 타인에게 轉貸하엿는데 그 料金은 年 400원이라는 거액이라 李王職에 납부하는 1만2천5백원을 除한 남어지 2만7천5백원의 純利益과 또 自營 9個區의 收入은 純全한 所得이 되엿다. 그 소득이 과연 얼마나 되엿슬가 秘密히 하는 계산임으로 正確한 바를 알 수 업스나 世說에 自營漁區중 2個所는 年收 40만원이엇다 하니 少不下 100원은 충분하엿다. 香椎씨는 이와 가티「特權」을 가진 권리로 매년 100만원 이상의 소득이 잇섯다. 그러니 과거 약 20년간의 그 이득이 과연 얼마나 되엿슬가. 하여튼 두 주퍽만 볼근 쥐고 나섯든 香椎씨가 政友 등에 貢獻한 바도 잇서 웬만한 知事쯤은 머리도 못 들게 된 것이 결코 우연한 바라 할 수 잇슬가!

公家의 100萬圓計劃
매년 100만원! 20년치면 2천만원 필경 계약기한이 다하여 今年 5월 1일부터는 다시 李鍵公家의 소유로 돌아왓다. 多年 切齒腐心까지는 甚하지만 억울한 처지에 잇든 李鍵公家사무소에서는 이 改締期를 기회로 公家의 기본재산이 될만한 금액을 납부하면 영원히(漁業金에 10년까지)  그 漁場을 讓與하기로 작정하고 香椎씨와는 그 緣故權을 인정하여 隨意계약을 행하기도 하여 도로혀 香椎씨에 대하여 상당한 代價로 讓受함을 慫慂하엿다. 그러나 香椎씨는 배를 통기고 誠意를 보히지 안헛슴으로 公家에서는 一般入札에 붓치기도 하고 각 신문에 광고를 揭載하고 또 府郡面에 入札用書類를 송부하여 入札者의 편의를 도읍고저 하엿다.

香椎氏의 暗中飛躍
公家에서 아무리 버틘대야 별 수가 잇슬가 하여 안심하엿든 香椎씨는 일반입찰에 付한다는 광고를 발견하고 靑天霹靂가티 놀래여 慶南知事 谷씨를 움지기고 또 總督府高官을 방문하는 등 대활약을 행한 결과는 谷知事는 管下府郡面에 명령하여 公家로부터 配付된 입찰관계서류의 取扱을 中止케 하고 또 친히 上京하여 總督 總監殖産局長을 방문하고 香椎씨와 협력하여 일반입찰 취소운동과 香椎씨와의 재계약에 대하여 渾身의 노력을 하엿다. 그러나 松村殖産局長은 간섭할 필요가 업다고 침묵직히고 齋藤總督은 吾不關焉이라는 듯이 (中略 - 원문) 에게 그 해결을 一任하엇다. 이리하야 一政商의 巨手는 필경 XX氏의 後援을 엇고야 마럿스니 (中略 - 원문) 은 篠田李王職次官을 招致하고 懇談(?) 數日에 亙한 결과는 필경 10個年賦償還總額 5십2만8십원이라는 금액으로 문제의 漁場 12區는 義親王宮의 손으로부터 香椎씨의 소유로 변해버리고 마럿다.

二十六萬圓의 大廉價
5십2만8천원이라 하면 莫大한 금액가티 생각되지마는 一時金이 아니고 10년간 年賦償還임으로 1년에 5만2천8백원式 支拂하면 그만이다. 그런데 5십2만8천원의 年利는 가장 헐잡어 5分이라 假定하더라도 年 2만6천5백원이니 利子를 加算한다 하면 香椎씨는 겨우 年 2만6천여 원 10년치를 합하야 2십6만원에 年收 5백만원 이상 10년을 합하면 천만원을 획득한 세음이다. 이 反面에 公家의 財政은 어떠케 되엿슬고? 經費가 裕足치 못한 公家에서는 이번에 公家 100年의 경영을 세우워 적어도 그 漁場에서 一時金 백만원은 만들어 노하여 일이 될 터이엇다. 그것이 年收入 3만6천원으로 좁으라 들엇스니 그 形便은 말함히 오히려 미욱한 것일 것이다.

公家職員急遽渡東
그러면 公家에서는 무슨 이유도 이 억울한 계약에 복종할 수 밧게 업섯슬가 (中略 - 원문) 의 頻頻한 篠田次官 초청에 의혹을 느낀 公家事務官 池尻씨와 顧問 前田小將은 事態緊迫하매 최후의 斷案을 李鍵公殿下께 仰請하고저 忽忽히 京城을 떠나 8월31일에 東京에 도착하엿다. 殿下께서는 軍隊의 演習관계로 習志野에 게시엇섯스니 일요일임으로 歸邸하실 것을 兩씨는 기대하고 잇슬 次에 東京邸 사무소에 一張의 至急電報가 들어와 잇섯스니＜36＞ 이것은 다른 것이 아니라 漁場 12區는 香椎씨와 5십2만8천원으로 隨意契約을 체결하엿스니 즉시 歸京하라는 것이엇다. 이것을 본 兩씨는 切齒掖腕하여 엇절줄을 모르는 次에 맛츰 殿下께서 歸邸하시엇슴으로 그 事由를 言上하엿더니 殿下께서는 젊으신 터에도 事理에 총명하시어 그런 불리한 계약을 승인치 못하시겟다고 하시면서 不滿한 빗츨 뛰우시엇다. 오후 7시까지 殿下께서는 兩씨에게 대하여 여러 가지 下問을 하시는 등 焦心하시엇스나 시간은 다하여 다시 習志野로 떠나시고 兩씨는 其 翌日에 宮內省皇室寮總裁를 방문하고 그 無利한 계약체결의 自初之終을 陳述하고 즉시 歸還하엿다.

李鍵公家의 悶忙

이러케 讓受者에 유리한 계약이 체결되엿다는 사실이 傳播되자 緣故者로 隨意契約을 하기로 된 8個所의 漁區와 一般入札에 붓친 18區의 讓受者들은 公家에 대하여 香椎씨와 同等의 조건으로 讓受함을 요구하엿다. 夜市의 싸구료장사도 아닌 이상 일일히 그러케 팔다가는 밋천조차 빼일수 업슬 터이라 公家에서는 하도 어이가 업서 其 문제는 『當公家의 책임이 아니니 總督府에 要望하라』는 一言으로 대답하엿슬 뿐이다.

裏面事情은 무엇?
波瀾疊出하리라고 觀測되는 漁場사건도 總督府의 幹旋은 별 수 업시 香椎씨에게 유리한 해결을 지엇는데 그러하기로니 公家職員이 渡東한 사이를 참지 못하여 急轉直下로 계약을 체결할 수 밧게 엇섯슴인가? 이는 兩씨의 보고가 殿下께 밋처지지 못한 사이에 해결을 지어야될 필요가 잇섯슴이다. 상당한 硬骨漢이라고 하는 篠田次官이 事理에 背馳되는 계약에 『盲印』을 찍엇슬 理도 업섯겟지만 法規에 朝鮮에 在한 李王職 官吏는 朝鮮總督의 監督을 바더야 된다고 하엿스니 만일 其職을 睹할 용기까지 업다면 黙從할 수 밧게 업슬 것이다. 또 傳하는 말에는 總監은 李堈殿下 隱退時의 某種조건을 理由로 하여 李王職을 牽制하엿다는 말도 잇스며 또장차 李鍵公家의 財政이 貧逼할 경우에는 상당한 考慮를 행하겟다는 一條를 揷入하엿다는 말도 잇스나 一商人과 公家와의 사이의 商的관계를 해결코저 하여 젹어도 최고 관청에서 大大的 노력을 하엿다 함은 凡人으로는 수긍치 못할 바이다.  ―(끗)―＜37＞
