Humor

Habitual Offender (常習犯)

Sunja: "If only someone else could have seen that college student proposing marriage to me, really! How could he be so persistent?"
Ok-hŭi: "Well, that would have been good. Just the other day when he came to see me too..." ―

At the Barbershop

A customer was nicked by the razor twice.
Customer: "Hey! Bring me a cup of water."
Barber: "Why? Did some hair get into your mouth?"
Customer: "Hair would be fine. I want to test with water whether a hole hasn't been pierced through my neck." <49>

**Summary**

This article presents two short jokes from 1931. The first involves two women discussing a college student who persistently proposes marriage, revealing he has recently proposed to both of them. The second joke takes place in a barbershop where a customer, nicked twice by the razor, asks for water, not because hair got in his mouth, but sarcastically, to check if the razor has pierced his neck. For historians, these jokes offer a glimpse into the lighthearted content consumed during the colonial period, reflecting simple social interactions (courtship behaviors, service encounters) and universal types of humor (situational irony, hyperbole). They provide a small window into everyday life and conversational styles of the era.
