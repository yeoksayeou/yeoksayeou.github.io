**Collection of Chosŏn Professional School Songs**

○ Kyŏngsŏng Posŏng Professional School (京城普成專門)

One

Life hidden in young hearts overflows and leaps!
This strength, this life, where shall it unfold?
To lift the oppressed, to straighten the bent,
We shall use and pour out this strength and this life.
(Posŏng Professional, Posŏng Professional, our alma mater Posŏng Professional)

Two

The banner our ranks raise is Life, Justice, Truth.
With the red blood of Sincerity and Courage, this we shall protect.
Though the murky waters of the whole world swirl and flow,
We are certain of the final victory of Justice and Truth.

Three

Look! Though the road ahead stretches thousands of miles,
The shining light of hope is immense and great.
The road is long and the task is great, but our preparation is also great.
Let us shout and rise up, O robust sons of Posŏng!

○ Kyŏngsŏng Ihwa Women's Professional School (京城梨花女專)

One

We who bloomed in the spring breeze by the great river (Han River),
A sage called this place Ihwa (Pear Blossom).
Amidst the lush greenery of Hwanghwabang, ripening deeply,
Hymns flow beautifully. Heaven is here! Heaven is here!

Two

The high spirit of chastity, a long, long history,
How could we reject the grace of Queen Aryŏng (알영)? We are people of Jiŭn (知恩 - Knowing Grace).
Learning the handiwork of weaving hemp from the Heavenly Weaver (天部),
With virtue as new embroidery,
Let's clothe all Chosŏn, clothe all Chosŏn!

Three

Washing away frivolous cosmetics (脂粉) with the baptism (洗禮) of righteous indignation (慷慨),
Let's raise the mast of the Chosŏn spirit and pass through the stormy waves.
Though busy, calmness is our true nature;
Having no attachment to vanity, let's walk to the Land of Laughter (笑地)! Walk to the Land of Laughter!

○ P'yŏngyang Sungsil Professional School (平壤崇實專門)

One

Where Moran Peak (모란峰) runs up and turns to sit,
And the waters of the Taedong River (大同江水) flow down and wind around,
The multi-storied building rising among the white clouds
Is Hapsŏng Sungsil School (合成崇實學校).
Sungsil Sungsil Hapsŏng Sungsil
Sungsil Sungsil Hapsŏng Sungsil
Sungsil Sungsil Hapsŏng Sungsil
Manse! Manse! Manse!

Two

The old pine trees of Mansu Terrace (萬壽臺) are evergreen companions,
And the rock faces of Yongak Mountain (龍岳山) are like white jade.
This picturesque, wondrous landscape, this fine scenery
Is eternally green (만청상).

Three

Developing a taste for all studies, astronomy and geography,
When we almost forget the passage of the bright days under the blue sky,
To the sound of the bell and chime falling with the hours,
Let us come to our senses!

Four

Miraculous is the origin of our school!
Its foundation was laid where the Rock of Ages (萬世磐石) opened,
And the spring of Life gushing from within it
Spreads to the Four Seas (四海).

○ Kyŏngsŏng Yŏnhŭi Professional School (京城延禧專門)

Embracing the Han River (漢江) in half a day,
On the Yŏnhŭi hill, deeply wrapped in green breath,
Stands tall our school building.
We who learn in this precious building,
Train spirit and body firmly,
Embrace the meaning of the True Teaching (眞理敎), and on the path of new Life,
As we cultivate vessels of Truth (眞實) and Purity (純潔),
We shall become the light that brightens the world.
Without resting even for a moment,
With all sincerity (精誠) and strength,
When we fulfill our duties (제작분),
God (하나님) helps us
And gives us eternal blessings (求遠無窮).

**Summary**

This article presents the school songs (lyrics only) of four prominent professional schools (Chŏnmun Hakkyo) in colonial Korea as of 1931: Posŏng, Ihwa Women's, Sungsil, and Yŏnhŭi, all located in either Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul) or P'yŏngyang. Each song expresses the ideals, values, and aspirations of its respective institution, often referencing local geography, history (like Silla's Queen Aryŏng for Ihwa), Christian beliefs (notably Sungsil and Yŏnhŭi), and a commitment to societal contribution or national spirit (Posŏng, Ihwa).

For historians, this collection is valuable as it reflects the institutional identities being cultivated in Korean higher education under Japanese rule. The songs show a blend of modern educational ideals (discipline, knowledge), nationalism (references to Chosŏn, spirit), traditional elements (historical figures), and significant Western/Christian influence (especially at mission schools like Ihwa, Sungsil, Yŏnhŭi). The use of Korean language and the specific themes chosen (like resilience, truth, justice, national service, divine blessing) offer insights into how these institutions positioned themselves and potentially fostered Korean identity within the constraints of the colonial period.
