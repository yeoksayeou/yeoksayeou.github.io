Domestic and Foreign News

After "Hangŭl" was officially established (公定) by the hands of Chosŏn scholars, its standard orthography has gradually come into use. Because of this, printing type (活字) must first be recast (改鑄). Therefore, the Tonga Ilbo-sa (東亞日報社), abandoning its conventional vernacular script type (諺文活字), will newly use Hangŭl type, and it is said they are currently vigorously casting (鑄造) it, so it seems it will be implemented by next spring at the latest.

The Hansŏng Book Printing Company (漢城圖書印刷會社) is also currently in the midst of abandoning its conventional type and casting new type in order to rely on Hangŭl type, and word is strong that it will likely come into use within the year. <7>

**Summary**

This news brief reports on the practical steps being taken to implement a newly standardized form of Hangul orthography in early 1931. Two major organizations, the newspaper company Tonga Ilbo-sa and the Hansŏng Book Printing Company, are actively recasting their printing typefaces to conform to the new standard, replacing older "vernacular script" type. The Tonga Ilbo expects to implement the change by the following spring, while the printing company anticipates using the new type within the year. From a historical perspective, this article is interesting as it documents the concrete actions taken by influential private entities to adopt and promote a standardized Korean writing system, even before the official 1933 unified orthography proposal. It highlights the growing momentum behind linguistic nationalism and modernization efforts by Koreans under colonial rule, focusing on the essential technology of print.
