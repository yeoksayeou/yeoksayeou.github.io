謝告 (Apology Notice)

Regarding the December issue, as some may know, due to a truly unexpected incident, although printing was almost entirely completed, we were unable to mail it out. During this time, we received various pressing letters from our esteemed readers, and we are extremely sorry (罪悚萬萬) for not being able to reply to each one individually. Henceforth, there will absolutely not be such an occurrence where the month's magazine does not come out within that month, so we humbly ask for your generous forgiveness (容怒) just this once.
From the Samch'ŏlli Company (三千里社白) <57>

**Summary**

This notice is an apology from the Samch'ŏlli Company to its readers for failing to distribute the December 1930 issue of the *Samch'ŏlli* magazine, despite it being nearly fully printed. The company attributes this failure to an unspecified "unexpected incident" and expresses deep regret for not being able to respond individually to reader inquiries. They promise that such delays will not happen again and ask for the readers' understanding. From a historical perspective, the vague mention of an "unexpected incident" preventing publication hints at the precarious environment for Korean publishers during the colonial period, possibly alluding to censorship, financial difficulties, or other external pressures imposed by the authorities, without explicitly stating the cause. The direct apology also highlights the relationship publishers tried to maintain with their readership.
