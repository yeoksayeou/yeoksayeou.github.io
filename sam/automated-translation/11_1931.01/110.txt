Regarding the first installment of the 'Complete Dissection of Chaebol' (財閥總解剖), in the article concerning the Kim Sŏngsu (金性洙) lineage, the passage at the end mentioning a wreath (花環) and so forth (云云) upon the death of Katō Takaaki (加藤高明) was reported by the author to be based on a mishearing (誤聞); therefore, we retract only that specific passage (該一節).<34>

**Summary**

This public notice retracts a specific detail from a previous article in the magazine's series analyzing Korean conglomerates (Chaebol). The retracted part concerned a claim that Kim Sŏngsu (or his faction) had sent a funeral wreath upon the death of Japanese politician Katō Takaaki. The magazine states the author admitted this information was based on a mishearing. This correction highlights the sensitivity surrounding the interactions between prominent Korean figures and Japanese officials during the colonial period. For historians, this brief notice is interesting as it reflects editorial practices of the time, the potential scrutiny faced by Korean elites regarding their relationship with the Japanese colonial power, and the importance of managing public perception in that context.
