Hanil and Hoseo Bank Merger

The Hanil Bank (韓一銀行) of Kyŏngsŏng and the Hoseo Bank (湖西銀行) of Ch'ŏnan are set to merge. It has been decided that the capital will be 4 million won, and the name will become the Chosŏn Tongil Bank (朝鮮東一銀行). Currently, the negotiations are progressing significantly. <37>

**Summary**

This short news brief reports on the planned merger between Hanil Bank, based in Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul), and Hoseo Bank, based in Ch'ŏnan. The merged entity is to be capitalized at 4 million won and named Chosŏn Tongil Bank, with negotiations reported to be well underway.
