**Witty Talk, Amusing Stories**

**Witty Talk**

Even seen in the daytime, a chestnut tree (밤나무, *bamnamu*).
Even seen at night, a sickle (낮자루, *natjaru*).

**Amusing Story**

A Dim-witted Couple
Husband—Turn off the light in that room.
Wife—It's dark, so I don't know where the electric light is.
Husband—What do you mean? If you turn on the light, you'll know where it is.<31>

**Summary**

This short piece features two types of humor: a "Witty Talk" section with wordplay based on Korean homonyms (밤 meaning both 'night' and 'chestnut'; 낮 meaning both 'day' and 'sickle'), and an "Amusing Story" depicting a conversation between a dim-witted husband and wife about turning off a light in a dark room. The humor is simple and based on puns and situational irony. For historians, this offers a glimpse into popular, everyday humor during the colonial period in Korea. The apolitical nature of the jokes and the mention of an "electric light" (전등) in a domestic setting might be of interest, reflecting both potential censorship or a focus on light entertainment, and the gradual introduction of modern technology.
