A Spring Alone, Selection of Masterpieces from the Peninsula's New Literary Scene of the Last Twenty Years
						Yohan

A spring alone
Goes dancing<162>
Through the stone crevices of the mountain valley.

A spring alone
Goes smiling
Through the flowers on the rugged mountain path.

The sky is clear,
That joyful sound
Echoes through the mountains and fields.
(1918)<163>

**Summary**

This short poem by Yohan, titled "A Spring Alone," depicts a spring flowing cheerfully through a mountain landscape. It personifies the spring, describing it as dancing and smiling as it navigates rocks and flowers under a clear sky, its sound echoing happily. Published in 1935 as part of a series selecting "masterpieces" from the preceding twenty years of Korean literature, the poem itself is dated 1918. For historians, the article is interesting as it represents an early modern Korean poem deemed a "masterpiece" during the Japanese colonial period. Its inclusion in this retrospective collection reflects contemporary literary tastes and the ongoing formation of a modern Korean literary canon under colonial rule, highlighting nature imagery common in early modern Korean poetry.

샘물이 혼자서
춤추며 간다＜162＞
산골작이 돌틈으로

샘물이 혼자서
우스며 간다
험한 산길 꼿 사이로.

하늘은 말근데
즐거운 그 소래
산과 들에 울니운다
