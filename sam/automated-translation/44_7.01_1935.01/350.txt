Golden Lawn, Peninsula New Literary Scene's Masterpiece Selection
						Sowŏl
Golden Lawn
Lawn
Lawn,

The fire pouring in the deep mountains and streams
Is the golden lawn by the departed lover's grave.
Spring has come, the colors of spring have come.

Even to the tips of the willow tree, to the thin branches.
The spring colors have come, the spring day has come
To the golden lawn in the deep mountains and streams.

Azaleas
When you leave,
finding me unbearable,
I shall gently let you go without a word.

From Yaksan (藥山) in Ningbyŏn (寧邊),
an armful of azaleas
I shall pick and scatter upon your path.

Step by step,
upon the flowers laid before you,
tread lightly as you go.

When you leave,
finding me unbearable,
though I die, I shall not shed a tear. <167>

**Summary**

This article presents two poems, "Golden Lawn" (금잔듸) and "Azaleas" (진달내꼿), by the renowned Korean poet Kim Sowŏl (using his pen name 素月). They are featured as part of a collection titled "Peninsula New Literary Scene's Masterpiece Selection of the Last Twenty Years," published in the January 1935 issue of the magazine *Samch'ŏlli* (삼천리). The poems exemplify Sowŏl's characteristic lyrical style, exploring themes of nature, remembrance, loss, and suppressed sorrow (han). For historians, this selection highlights the contemporary recognition of Sowŏl as a major figure in modern Korean poetry during the Japanese colonial period. The inclusion of these specific, largely apolitical, lyrical poems in a "masterpiece" collection might reflect the cultural climate and publishing constraints of the time, potentially favoring works focused on personal sentiment and natural beauty over overt nationalism or social critique.

金잔듸, 半島 新文壇 二十年來 名作選集
						素月
금잔듸
잔듸
잔듸,

深深山川에 붓는 불은
가신님 무덤까에 금잔듸
봄이 왓네, 봄빗치 왓네

버드나무 끗테도 실가지에.
봄빗치 왓네, 봄날이 왓네
深深山川에 금잔듸에.

진달내꼿
나보기가 역겨워
가실 때에는
말업시 고히 보내드리우리다

寧邊에 藥山
진달래꼿
아름답다 가실 길에 뿌리우리다

가시는 거름거름
노힌 그 꼿츨
삽분히 즈려밟고 가시옵소서

나보기가 역겨워
가실 때에는
죽어도 아니 눈물 흘니우리다.＜167＞
