Passing the Site of a Koguryŏ Fortress, Selected Masterpieces from the Peninsula's New Literary World of the Last Twenty Years
						Sŏk Song

I go, having only heard in words
that the site of our Lord (님) exists.
That the border reached this far,
everyone acknowledges,
so how is it that this body, sharing that bloodline,
only now comes to know it?

Those who burn, those who descend,
all have new faces.
Though the cornfield (강낭이 밧) is visible,
where has the owner gone?
Blue waves strike the iron embankment (철뚝);
mulberry fields have turned into the blue sea (桑田碧海).

At the young woman's (시악시) sigh,
the corn stalks (강낭숩히) sway gently.
In the traveler's (나그내) breast,
the Passion for the Continent (大陸熱) smolders fiercely.
When will the day come
when You (님) and I can laugh together?
The wind blowing in the cornfield (강낭밧헤)
is the young woman's sigh.
This fire burning in my breast,
the fire kindled in Koryŏ's (고려) time—
if wind and fire were to combine,
what could not be brought back to life?
(Between Talyŏn and Yŏsun (大連旅順間)) <176>

**Summary**

This poem, written while traveling between Dalian and Lüshun in Manchuria, reflects the poet's sorrow and longing upon visiting a historical site associated with the ancient Koguryŏ kingdom. The poet laments the lost territory, acknowledges the passage of time and change ("mulberry fields have turned into the blue sea"), and observes the present landscape now occupied by others. A strong sense of nationalistic yearning permeates the work, expressed as a "Passion for the Continent" and a hope for a future reunion or restoration ("When will the day come when You and I can laugh together?"). The poem ends with a fiery resolve, suggesting that the combined force of the people's lament (wind) and historical spirit (fire) could revive the nation's past glory. For historians, the poem is a poignant example of Korean nationalist sentiment during the colonial period, particularly the focus on Koguryŏ history and the Manchurian connection as a source of inspiration and claim to a larger historical territory, subtly protesting the contemporary political situation. The mention of "大陸熱" (Passion for the Continent) is particularly revealing of the historical consciousness connecting Korea to Manchuria.

高句麗城址過次, 半島 新文壇 二十年來 名作選集
						石松
님의 터 잇다 함을
말로만 듯고 가네.
예까지 지경임은
누구나 인정커든
엇지타 혈육바든 이 몸이
이제 겨우 알니요.

타는 이 나리는 이
모도다 새 얼골을
강낭이 밧은 뵈나
주인은 어대간고
창파가 철뚝을 치니
상전벽해.

시악시의 한숨에는
강낭숩히 한들한들
나그내의 가슴에는
大陸熱이 푹푹지네.
언쩨나 님과 나와도
우서불 날 잇슬가.
강낭밧헤 부는 바람
시악시의, 한숨이오.
이 가슴에 타는 불을
고려 적에 붓튼 불을
바람과 불이 합한다면
무엇인들 못살느리.
(大連旅順間에서)＜176＞
