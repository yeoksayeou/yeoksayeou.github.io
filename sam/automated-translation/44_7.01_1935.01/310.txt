Catching the Spring Moon, Peninsula (半島) New Literary World 20-Year Masterpiece Anthology
						Yohan

Trying to catch the moon in the day
Treading on blue shadows, I went,
Only the wind brushed the grass on the hill,
And the moon went across the water-

Trying to catch the moon on a spring day
Parting golden waves, rowing I went,
Only the lonely sound of water washing stones remained,
And the moon passed the fields, crossed the hill, and set-

Trying to catch the moon on a spring day
Crawling through the "Night," I rose to the sky,
Showing only half its face, it asked,
"If it weren't a dream, how could you have come?"-

Trying to catch the moon on a spring day
Pushing through dream paths, searching I went,
Before I even arrived, the stars blocked the way, saying,
"If it weren't a dream, how could you have come?"-
(1923.3) <162>

**Summary**

This poem, "Catching the Spring Moon," by Yohan, uses the recurring motif of pursuing the elusive moon on a spring day as a metaphor for striving after an unattainable ideal or desire. The speaker attempts to reach the moon through various means – chasing shadows, rowing across water, climbing into the night sky, and navigating dream paths – only to find the moon receding or being told the quest is only possible within a dream. The poem evokes a sense of longing, melancholy, and the dreamlike nature of aspiration. From a colonial history perspective, the poem, written in 1923 and published in 1935, reflects the period's atmosphere where Korean aspirations (perhaps for independence, artistic fulfillment, or modernity) might have felt similarly distant and dreamlike under Japanese rule. The focus on personal lyricism and natural imagery, while potentially apolitical on the surface, can also be seen as a turn inward during a time of external constraints, preserving Korean sentiment and language.

봄달잡이, 半島 新文壇 二十年來 名作選集
						요한
날에 달을 잡으려
푸른 그림자를 밟으며 갓더니
바람만 언덕에 풀을 스치고
달은 물을 건너 가고요-

봄날에 달을 잡으러
금 물결 헤치고 저어 갓더니
돌 싯는 물소리만 적적하고
달은 들넘어 재넘어 기울고요-

봄날에 달을 잡으러
「밤」을 기어 하늘에 올낫더니
반쯤만 얼골을 내다 보면서
「꿈이 아니엇더면 엇더케 왓스랴」-

봄날에 달을 잡으려
꿈 길을 헤처 차자 갓더니
가기도 전에 별들이 막어서서
「꿈이 아니엇더면 엇더케 왓스랴」-
(1923.3) ＜162＞
