Notice of Apology

Because there was such an overwhelming number of manuscripts submitted for the New Year issue, we unavoidably had many that were postponed to the coming February issue. We are extremely sorry to the writers and readers.

**Summary**

This brief notice from the Editorial Bureau of Samch'ŏlli magazine apologizes to authors and readers because the high volume of submissions for the New Year (January) issue forced them to postpone publishing many articles until the February issue. From a historical perspective, this notice indicates the magazine's popularity, reflected in the large number of manuscript submissions it received. It also provides a glimpse into the practical constraints and editorial processes of magazine publishing in colonial Korea during the 1930s, highlighting the use of contemporary Korean orthography and Hanja.
