The Departed One, Selected Masterpieces from the Peninsula's New Literary Scene of the Last Twenty Years
						Chŏng In-bo

To think your face is covered with earth,
Thickly entangled, oh heartless autumn weeds!
Oh night, I saw you in a dream, are you at peace?

Could I have known your welcome letters would become sorrow?
The affection flowing line by line has not yet dried.
Holding it respectfully to my face, it feels as if it cuts me.

Thinking of how kindly you looked upon this unworthy one revives the memory.
Could you truly not bear to see my form as it was?
How could I know I became hateful because I was lacking?

Your eyes closed, and my whole life was covered.
Seeing me, you felt pity, but weeping for you, I feel it more.
When the sleeping rooster flaps its wings and crows, I think, "It must be that time."

Though your frame was small, your voice was loud;
The trembling lips you pursed, every wrinkle was dear;
In your bent, thin waist, diligence was seen.

Why ask about the house site? Even Kyŏngbok Palace is but a dream.
That Namsan, deep with sorrow (한), holds the old face you used to see.
Standing there brings only tears, but reciting this aloud brings sorrow.

My thoughts are disordered; beginning and end are confused.
Writing brings tears; finishing brings sighs.
Lest you might hear, I go out and recite it aloud.

Was I in such a rush to see the sliding door of your room?
Hurrying past the inner gate screen, I stumbled and fell.
My injured arm aches again, but where have you gone?

A daughter-like daughter-in-law, a mother-like mother-in-law;
You used to truly lament even a flower that fell before blooming.
Now beside the covering earth, please stroke it gently.

The young granddaughter who lost her mother's milk continued her life in your arms.
The marriage you arranged, what about the year after next?<164>
With you absent in all matters, what joy could there be?

Giving away the warm rice from your bowl, you always ate the cold things;
Making sure others were warmly dressed, you wore thin clothes in winter.
You said you liked the cotton skirt, but it ended up as a funerary offering (보공).

That I read texts and write prose, would you know this?
That I praise you daily, would you see this?
There is no wish other than to call your name; I wonder if this life is truly living.

Sorrowful, sorrowful, yet even a son is a separate body.
Today, when the grave grass has grown thick, can it be said this flesh (살) still remains?
Do not believe anyone who merely pretends to be sad.<165>
<164-165>

**Summary**

This poem by Chŏng In-bo is a heartfelt lament expressing deep grief and longing for a deceased loved one, strongly implied to be his mother-in-law. The speaker reminisces about her appearance, her character (diligence, kindness, self-sacrifice), shared memories, and the void left by her absence, affecting everything from family life to future events like a planned marriage. The poem contrasts the transient nature of worldly things (like Kyŏngbok Palace) with the enduring pain of loss, culminating in a raw expression of sorrow and a questioning of the meaning of life without the departed. From a historical perspective, the poem is significant as it showcases personal, emotional expression using traditional Korean poetic sensibilities and archaic language during the Japanese colonial period. It reflects the persistence of traditional family values and mourning customs, while its inclusion in a "Masterpiece Selection" highlights the contemporary recognition of Chŏng In-bo's literary talent within the colonial Korean literary scene (新文壇). Historians might find the blend of traditional form/theme with 1930s language and its publication context noteworthy.

가신 님, 半島 新文壇 二十年來 名作選集
						鄭寅普
참아 님의 낫츨 흙으로 가리단 말
우굿이 엉겟스니 무정할 손 추초로다
「밤」니여 꿈에 뵈오니 편안이나 하신가

반갑던 님의 글월 설음될 줄 알엇스리
줄줄이 흐르는 정 상긔아니 말럿도다
밧들어 낫에 대우니 배이는 듯 하여라

뭔나를 고히보심 생각하면 「되」서워라
냬양자 그대로를 긔아니 못보심가
내업서 네뮈워진 줄 어이네가 알것가

님의 눈 감으시니 내 일생 다 덥혀를
절보아 가련타만 님을 우러 더 늣겨라
자던 닭 나래처 울면 이 때러니 하여라

체수는 적으서도 목소리는 크시더니
「이」덜려 옴으신 「입」 주룸마다 귀엽더니
굽으신 마른 허리에 「부즈런」이 뵈더니

집터야 물을 것가 경복궁도 꿈이로다
「한」기픈 저 남산이 님 보시던 녯낫치라
게섯자 눈물이라만 외오보니 설워라

생각도 어지럴사 뒤 먼저도 바업고야
쓰다간 눈물이요 쓰고나니 한숨이라
행여나 님들으실까 나가 「외」와 봅내다

게신 방 미다지를 바라보기 급하던지
안중문 마진채를 밧비둘다 너머저를
다친 팔 도진다마는 님은 어대 가신고

딸가튼 며느리요 자모가튼 시어머니
피랴다 일진 꼿을 참아 늣겨 하시더니
덥흔 흙 겻헤 잇스니 어루만저 주소서

「젓」일흔 어린 손녀 님의 품에 명을 이어
님께서 정한 혼인 하머대야 내후년을＜164＞
만사에 님 안게시니 무슨 경이 잇스리

바릿 밥 남주시고 잡숫느니 찬 것이며
두둑키 다 입히고 겨울이라 열분 옷을
솜치마 조타시더니 「보공」되고 말아라

글 읽어 문장이라 님이 이를 아실것가
날마다 기린다제 님이 이를 보실것가
님 일콘 바람업서라 사니산가 하노라

설워라 설워라해도 아들도 딴몸이라
무덤풀 우군 오늘 이 「살」부더 잇단 말가
설말로 설은양 함을 뉘나 밋지 마옵소＜165＞
＜164-165＞
