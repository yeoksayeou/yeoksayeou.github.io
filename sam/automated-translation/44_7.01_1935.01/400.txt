*Spring Rain*
*By Cho Un*

Spring rain—
Since it’s spring rain,
let’s just get wet.

Getting soaked
by this rain,
if my heart gets drenched,

perhaps new shoots (새엄)
might sprout even in me...

It’s spring, they say,
it’s spring.
The willow buds are slowly, slowly creeping out.

After sleeping tonight,
and sleeping again for several (몃) more nights,
I too shall go out to the fields.
By then, the riverside flowers will be in full bloom,
so let’s fashion a flower garland
prettily, prettily, to give to my beloved.

You, do not be sad upon leaving.
If you cut down a single bamboo from the back garden (뒤ㅅ밧헤) before you go,
while you are away, I alone
will weave (절어) a basket for picking flowers (꼿따나릴).

Spring!
Spring where flowers bloom.
Spring where the wind blows.
Spring with shimmering haze
and skylarks singing.
Spring is indeed beautiful, oh so beautiful, but
what is to be done (엇저랴)!
There is little trustworthiness (미듬성이)—<173>

**Summary**

The poem "Spring Rain" by Cho Un celebrates the arrival of spring, symbolized by the gentle rain, budding willows, and the anticipation of blooming flowers. The speaker embraces the rain, hoping it might nurture inner growth ("new shoots"). There's a hopeful plan to make a flower garland for a loved one and a preparation for their departure by weaving a basket. The poem ends with an appreciation of spring's beauty but concludes with a slightly melancholic or cautious note about its lack of "trustworthiness." For historians, the poem offers a glimpse into the lyrical expression prevalent in Korean literature during the colonial period. While focusing on nature and personal sentiment, possibly as a way to navigate censorship, the final line ("미듬성이 적으니" - lacks trustworthiness) might subtly reflect the underlying uncertainty or precariousness of the era, adding a layer of potential ambiguity beyond just the fleeting nature of spring.

봄비
비라도 봄ㅅ비니
마저나 두자.

이 비를 마저서
마음이 저즈면

행여나 새엄이
도다나 나도...

봄이라네
봄이라네.
버드나무 눈이 실금실금 기어 나오네.

오늘밤을 자고
이제 몃 밤을 거듭 자고는
나도 들판으로 나아가랴네.
그제는 江가 꼿들이 한창일테니
님께 드릴 花環 하나를
곱게곱게 꾸미세나그려.

자네는 떠나며 섭섭해 하지마소.
뒤ㅅ밧헤 대나 한 개 벼어두고 가면
자네 올 동안 혼자서는
꼿따나릴 바구니를 절어 노을테니.

봄!
꼿피는 봄.
바람부는 봄.
아지랑이 끼고
종달새 우는 봄.
봄이 곱기야 좀 고으냐만
이를 엇저랴!
미듬성이 적으니-＜173＞
