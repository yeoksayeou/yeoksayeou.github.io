Apology and Gratitude

○As we look forward to the new year of 1935, we bow and pray for the abundance of your health and fortune.

○Reflecting upon the past year, our activities were not significant, and the achievements we have accomplished were truly insignificant. There were months when we even suspended publication (休刊), and times when issues were published late; indeed, there were only various matters for which we are truly sorry.

○However, Samch'ŏlli-sa (三千里社), now entering its seventh year, will henceforth use all past experiences as a mirror for reflection. We intend to exert diligent activity and outstanding effort, surpassing others, to offer our utmost sincerity like that of a dog or horse (犬馬의 誠) in service to our brethren (내 兄弟).<300>

**Summary**

This editorial from the January 1935 issue of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine expresses apologies to readers for shortcomings in the previous year, including suspended publication and late issues. It acknowledges their performance was insignificant. Looking forward, the editors pledge renewed dedication for the magazine's seventh year, promising diligent effort and outstanding work in service to their Korean readership ("brethren") with utmost humility and loyalty. From a historical perspective, the article reveals the operational difficulties faced by Korean publications under Japanese colonial rule (implied by suspension and delays). It also showcases the blend of humble apology with a persistent nationalist sentiment, framing the magazine's purpose as serving the Korean people ("내 兄弟") using traditional expressions of loyal service ("犬馬의 誠").
