(Tranquility)

Upwards, upwards, over the white sandy ground
One step, two steps, one step, two steps.
Shall I step on the footprints left by my beloved (님)?

Then shall I go?
Shall I go to that place where my beloved went?
But my legs are heavy.
My footsteps falter.

But will my beloved be there?
Will they truly be there without deception?
Being there, are they waiting for the one who goes?

Through the blue Gate (푸른 門),
The holy dream you sent,
The holy song you called,
This foolish child, in order to find them,
Every night, every night, following the stars,
Wanders through towns and streets. <179>

**Summary**

This poem, "Tranquility" (靜謚), by Pak Chong-hwa, expresses a deep sense of yearning and hesitant pursuit. The speaker contemplates following the path of a departed "beloved" (님), symbolized by footprints on white sand. However, weighed down by heavy legs and faltering steps, the speaker questions if the beloved is truly waiting. The poem concludes with the image of the speaker, a "foolish child," wandering nightly under the stars, searching for the "holy dream" and "holy song" sent by the beloved through a "blue Gate." From a colonial history perspective, the poem's themes of loss, longing, and uncertain searching could resonate with the national situation. The ambiguous "님" (nim) might represent not just a personal beloved but also a lost leader, national sovereignty, or an idealized past/future, making the difficult journey and uncertain destination poignant reflections of the era's anxieties and aspirations. Historians might find the poem's blend of personal lament and potentially allegorical national sentiment useful for understanding the psychological landscape of intellectuals during the Japanese occupation.

靜謚
우으로 우으로 白沙地 우으로
하나 둘 하나 둘.
님 발분은 자최를 밟으오릿가.

그러면 가지리잇가
님 가신 그곳으로 가지리잇가.
그러나 다리는 무거웁니다.
발길은 비척 거려집니다.

그러나 우리 님은 게시리까
속임업시 그곳에 게시리까
게시어 가는 사람 기다리닛가

푸른 門으로
당신의 보내신 거륵한 꿈을
당쉀 의 부르신 거륵한 노래를
미련한 어린이는 찻기 위하야
밤마다 밤마다 별을 따라서
동네와 거리로 헤매임니다.＜179＞
