Marquis Yi Wan-yong is also someone who has lived through fifty years of spring winds and autumn rains (春風秋雨). The ups and downs of his life were severe, and the changes were many. What kind of path did he walk during his youth? What thoughts did he have? We publish below the recollections of Mr. Hyŏn Ryŏng, who grew up with the Marquis from his school days, traveled to America together, and shared close associations. Through this, we can glimpse the circumstances of that time, and perhaps it will also be a help in understanding Marquis Yi Wan-yong's entire life. — Editor

**Marquis Yi Wan-yong and I**

I am probably one of the people who knew Marquis Yi Wan-yong best. Why? Because we were schoolmates at Yukyŏng Kongwŏn (育英公院) and also traveled to America together, where we lived under the same roof for several years, sharing meals and lodging. Therefore, my knowledge of him compared to others is likely quite significant.

He was a child of a noble (貴族) family, and I was also a so-called nobleman's son (貴公子). Naturally, we became friends. My interactions with him were somewhat different compared to other friends. How so? You ask what I mean? At that time, most sons of high officials (大官) were full of spirit (氣焰), imposing and arrogant (等等), but he alone had remarkable spirit (氣槪), was composed (沈着), and poised (태연하엿섯다). First of all, unlike the trend of acting with the backing of one's parents' influence, one could see in him the spirit (意氣) to pursue his own beliefs. His perception was sharp (銳敏) and penetrating (透徹), his intelligence was extraordinary (비상하얏스며), and his memory was outstanding (出衆). I could not help but admire (敬服) him in that respect. His appearance (風采) was imposing (堂堂), his build (骨格) large (壯大), his features (眉目) handsome (秀麗), and his voice (音聲) resonant (宏亮), so anyone meeting him could immediately see (一見) his heroic bearing (豪傑다운 器局).

**Going to America Together**

Later, when government-funded students (官費學生) were dispatched to America, Marquis Yi Wan-yong strongly urged (極力 勸誘) me to go along as an attendant (隨員) to broaden my knowledge (見識). As I also wanted to see the conditions of developed countries (文明國), I readily (쾌히) accepted (應諾).

During the sea voyage of over ten days, Marquis Yi Wan-yong, unlike others who enjoyed themselves, spent his free time (餘暇) engrossed (專心 열중하얏섯다) in reading books (書冊). Seeing this, I felt that he was indeed different from ordinary people.

Arriving in America and seeing the various aspects of civilization (文明), my thoughts were deeply moved (感慨 無量하엿다). Marquis Yi also seemed greatly stimulated. Especially concerning the thought world (思想界) and political world (政治界) of America, he seemed to think and feel many things. Was it because of this? Upon returning home (歸國), he quickly took a leading position (指導的 地位) in importing new knowledge (新知識) and suddenly transformed (變身) himself into a champion (健兒) of the Independence Club (獨立協會), engaging in vigorous activity (活躍). And yet, in later years (後年), he came to bear the title of "nation-seller" (賣國奴). Alas (嗚呼), human life (人生이란) is truly incomprehensible (不可思議)!

**A Chat with Sŏ Chae-p'il**

While we were studying in America, Sŏ Chae-p'il (徐載弼) came to see us. He had previously been involved in the Kapsin Coup (甲申政變) with Kim Ok-kyun (金玉均), Pak Yŏng-hyo (朴泳孝), Sŏ Kwang-bŏm (徐光範), Hong Yŏng-sik (洪英植), etc., and when it failed, he took refuge (亡命) in America, changed his name, and was living there. Marquis Yi Wan-yong and Sŏ Chae-p'il seemed to have been acquainted (舊面) before, as they talked intimately (懇懇히) for a long time. Although I could not know the inner details (內幕話) of their conversation, judging from their expressions and attitudes, it seemed they were discussing the future of Chosŏn (朝鮮). After Sŏ Chae-p'il left, Marquis Yi Wan-yong looked unusually flushed and agitated. Perhaps Sŏ Chae-p'il's words had stimulated him.

<61>

Later, Sŏ Chae-p'il returned to Chosŏn and became a central figure in the Independence Club, advocating for civil rights (民權) and exerting considerable influence. Marquis Yi Wan-yong, along with Yi Sang-jae (李商在) and others, also became core members (中心人物) of the Independence Club and were very active. It is said that Sŏ Chae-p'il had a significant influence on this.

Looking back now, Marquis Yi Wan-yong's life was truly one of dramatic changes (變轉). From a young man passionate about enlightenment (啓蒙) who studied abroad and led the Independence Club, to being branded the ultimate traitor – his life encompasses the turbulent transition of Chosŏn. It makes one ponder the complexities of fate and history.

**Summary**

This article presents recollections of Yi Wan-yong by Hyŏn Ryŏng, a childhood friend and fellow student who accompanied Yi to America. Hyŏn Ryŏng describes the young Yi Wan-yong as intelligent, composed, imposing, and possessing an independent spirit, distinct from other privileged youths. He recounts their trip to America, Yi's studious nature, his deep impression by American civilization, and his subsequent transformation into a leader of the Independence Club upon returning to Korea. The article also mentions an encounter with Sŏ Chae-p'il in America, suggesting Sŏ's influence on Yi's later activities. The author concludes by reflecting on the incomprehensible turns in Yi Wan-yong's life, from an enlightenment activist to the figure later reviled as a "nation-seller." For historians, this piece offers a rare contemporary perspective on Yi Wan-yong's early character and motivations from someone who knew him intimately before his later controversial political career. It provides insight into the influences (like study in America and interaction with figures like Sŏ Chae-p'il) that shaped members of the Korean elite during the critical period leading up to and during the early colonial era, complicating the often monolithic portrayal of figures like Yi Wan-yong.
