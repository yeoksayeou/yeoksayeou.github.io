**Body Text Translation:**
Audience (拜謁)
By Pak Yŏngch'ŏl (朴榮喆), Honorary Consul General of Manchukuo

To His Majesty Emperor Kangdŏk (康德皇帝陛下)

Peach blossoms bloom profusely in the nine-layered spring palace,
At close quarters in the dragon tower, I had an audience with the sage ruler.
As an official arrayed in Han court attire, I witnessed the rituals again,
The Emperor embraces the Zhou dynasty's spirit, his mandate renewed.
Viewing all as one family, there is no distinction between near and far,
He first cultivates the Six Treasuries, extending benevolence and humaneness fully.
With special consideration for the close friendship between Manchuria and Korea (滿鮮),
He has provisionally dispatched this unworthy subject to protect the resident people.

Offering Thanks (奉謝)
On the Visit of Prime Minister Chang (張總理) to Korea (朝鮮)

The long river, like a sash, is crossed by a single bridge,
Korea and Manchuria (鮮滿) have always been brother nations.
The Prime Minister's current journey is no easy undertaking,
Trade agreements and mutual pacts reflect a special relationship.
At the initial banquet, I was already captivated by his heartfelt words,
Everywhere he goes, people compete to raise their hands in welcome.
Though entrusting me to serve in the same court brings great joy,
How can I, following the trend, demonstrate my humble sincerity? <8>

**Summary**

The article consists of two poems in Classical Chinese by Pak Yŏngch'ŏl, identified as Manchukuo's Honorary Consul General. The first poem describes his audience with Emperor Kangdŏk (Puyi) of Manchukuo, praising the emperor's rule, the state's renewal, and the close relationship between Manchukuo and Korea, highlighting his own role in protecting Korean residents there. The second poem welcomes Manchukuo's Prime Minister Chang Kyŏnghye (Zhang Jinghui) to Korea, emphasizing the "brotherly" ties, special trade relations, and the warm reception he receives, again expressing Pak's loyalty. From a historical perspective, these poems are significant examples of collaborationist literature by a Korean figure during the colonial period. They publicly affirm loyalty to the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo and promote the ideology of unity between Korea and Manchukuo under Japanese influence, which historians would find valuable for understanding the political alignments and propaganda efforts of the era.
