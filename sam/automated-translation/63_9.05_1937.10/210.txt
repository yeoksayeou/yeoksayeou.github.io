Even on the crumbled fortress site, the spring is mellow.
Where have the old friends who defended the fortress gone?
Only the flowers you cherished laugh lonelily.

In the water too, blue mountains, white clouds drift.
Only your image is a distant dream.
The passing lonely traveler is tearful.

Crossing waters, passing mountains, I have wandered tens of thousands of *ri*.
No matter how I observe, how marvelous are these mountains and rivers!
The one I long for in my heart becomes even more fervent. <19>

**Summary**

This poem by Kwŏn Paegŭn reflects on the ruins of Ganghwa Fortress (강화성) during springtime. The poet observes the beauty of nature reclaiming the site but feels a deep sense of loss and melancholy, wondering about the fate of those who once defended it. The poem contrasts the enduring landscape with the transience of human presence and expresses a poignant longing, possibly for a lost past or a specific person evoked by the scenery. From a historical perspective, the poem, written during the Japanese colonial period, uses the historical setting of Ganghwa Fortress—a site of past Korean resistance and royalty—to evoke themes of loss, memory, and perhaps a veiled yearning for sovereignty or a cherished past, making it interesting to historians studying cultural expressions of national sentiment under colonial rule.

강화성
						權培根
문혀진 城터에도 무르녹은 봄이구려
城 직히던 옛 벗님 가신 곳 어데시요
당신이 앗기든 꽃만 외로히 웃소

물에도 푸른山 힌 구름 노오.
당신의 양자만이 아득한 꿈이구려
지나는 외로운 나그네 눈물겨웁소

물 건너 山 지나 數萬里를 다도랏소
아무리 살피여도 妙할 손 이山川을
가슴속 그리는 님 더욱 간절하구려 ＜19＞
