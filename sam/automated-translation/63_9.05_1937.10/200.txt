Discount

Groom: "Don't be too angry. In reality, my salary is much less than what I told you before."
Bride: "Oh, that's alright. I'm also a bit older than what I told you before the marriage."

Obvious Reason

Yi: "Hey there. I heard you got married. Who did you marry?"
Pak: "A woman."
Yi: "Is there any doubt? Was there ever a fellow who married a man?"
Pak: "Why not? Look at my older sister!"

Even in Dreams

Wife: "Honey, please pull yourself together. Every night while sleeping, you grind your teeth so loudly."
Husband: "That's because every night I dream of you!" <19>

**Summary**

This article presents three short jokes typical of the era. The first joke involves a newlywed couple revealing discrepancies in what they told each other before marriage – the husband about his salary, the wife about her age. The second is a wordplay joke where a man points out his sister married a man when asked if anyone marries someone of the same sex. The third features a wife complaining about her husband's teeth grinding, to which he replies it's because he dreams of her. From a historical perspective, these jokes offer a glimpse into social interactions and humor in 1930s Korea, touching upon themes like honesty in marriage, gender roles, and marital complaints, presented in a lighthearted manner using colloquial language and older spellings of the time.
