Receipt of Patriotic Donations and Comfort Funds

Since the outbreak of the North China Incident (北支事變), the situation has spread even to Shanghai, and the gravity of the times is just as reported daily. Accordingly, patriotic defense donations and comfort funds for officers and soldiers from the general public are flooding into the military authorities and relevant authorities every day. We will receive and forward these defense donations and comfort funds, and at the same time, we will announce the esteemed names (芳名) of those who entrust them to us in this magazine (本誌). Therefore, we ask that all gentlemen (諸氏) show the sincerity of their patriotism and hope that there will be many donations by all means. <4>

**Summary**

This editorial announcement from the October 1937 issue of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine informs readers that following the outbreak of the North China Incident (start of the Second Sino-Japanese War) and its spread to Shanghai, the magazine will act as an intermediary, accepting "patriotic donations" and "comfort funds" for Japanese soldiers. It states that donations are flooding into the authorities and encourages readers to contribute generously, promising to publish the names of donors in the magazine. For historians, this piece is a stark example of how Korean publications under Japanese colonial rule were mobilized to support the Japanese war effort, framing contributions to the colonizer's military as "patriotism" and publicly pressuring Koreans to donate by listing contributors' names.
