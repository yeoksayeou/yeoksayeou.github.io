To You
						Kim Il-yŏp

My young spirit, believing your words,
Goes along without even knowing the direction, but
With powerless, faltering steps, when shall I ever see you?

Was it a thousand years ago, ten thousand years ago, that you called?
When I feel your words, it is as if I see you right now,
And though I leap about in Dharma joy (法悅), when I look up, I am still here.<47>

**Summary**

This short poem by Kim Il-yŏp expresses a deep spiritual yearning for a revered figure referred to as "Nim." The speaker feels small and lost ("young spirit," "without even knowing the direction"), struggling on a path towards this figure with "powerless, faltering steps." Despite moments of intense spiritual connection and joy ("Dharma joy," "as if I see you right now"), the ultimate goal remains distant ("when shall I ever see you?", "when I look up, I am still here"). From a historical perspective, the poem reflects a common turn towards spirituality or inner reflection during the oppressive colonial period, possibly as an alternative to direct political engagement. Written by Kim Il-yŏp, a prominent early feminist figure who later became a Buddhist nun, the poem likely reflects her personal spiritual journey and search for enlightenment, which might interest historians studying intellectual and religious shifts under colonial rule.

님에게
						金一葉
나의 어린靈이 님의 말슴 믿사옵고
방향조차 모르고서 가노라고 가지만은
힘없는 지축거름 어느 때나 님뵈리까

님께서 부르심이 천년전가 만년전가
님의 말슴 늣길때는 금시님을 뵈옵는듯
法悅에 뛰놀다가도 들처보면 거기로다＜47＞
