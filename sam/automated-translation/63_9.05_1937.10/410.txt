The sound of autumn is already in the paulownia leaves before the steps. As we now greet the cool autumn season, we realize that all the gloom accumulated over the long summer disappears, and a refreshing energy returns.

The current situation is extremely grave. We urge all of you readers to exercise prudence, not be swayed by rumors, devote yourselves diligently to your work, and strive in reading and contemplation.

The saying of the ancients, "The sky is high and the horses are fat" (天高馬肥), is not empty talk. It feels as if the distant mountains have come several steps closer, and the sky seems several measures wider; everything appears intimate, expansive, and clear. Where else could there be such a fine season as this?

Regrettably, due to personal matters (私情), I was away in the countryside for nearly three months. I returned to Seoul (上京) on August 16th and completed this editing work in just four or five days. Therefore, please forgive the many deficiencies. In return, starting from the next issue (來號), I intend to provide you with excellent editing worthy of your attention. (鷲) <50>

**Summary**

This editorial postscript from the October 1937 issue of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine greets readers at the start of autumn. The editor apologizes for the shortcomings of the current issue, explaining they were due to a prolonged absence and rushed editing upon return. Amidst appreciation for the autumn season, the editor urgently advises readers to remain calm, focus on their work and reading, and avoid rumors during the "extremely grave" current situation. From a historical perspective, the mention of the "grave situation" and the warning against rumors clearly point to the tense atmosphere following the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in July 1937. Historians might find this piece interesting for its direct reflection of the anxieties and the call for self-restraint imposed or encouraged within Korean society under Japanese colonial rule during wartime.
