**Guest Talk Room**

How is everyone doing in these tumultuous times?

Mr. Pak Yŏng-ch’ŏl (朴榮喆氏) = After becoming the Honorary Consul General of Manchukuo (滿洲國), he visited the capital, Hsinching (新京 - Sin'gyŏng), to meet Premier Chang (張承相 - Chang Sŭng-sang) for the first time. He has known Premier Chang for a long time, and also has a long acquaintance with Mr. Pak Sŏk-yun (朴錫胤氏), who is a bureau director in the foreign ministry, so he said he discussed much about ‘Korea-Manchuria Friendship’ (鮮滿友誼) and had many gains.

Mr. Yŏ Un-hyŏng (呂運亨氏) = Although the newspaper isn't even being published, after resigning as president of the Chungang Ilbo, Mr. Yŏ, being originally a sportsman, has recently become chairman of a Boxing Club (拳鬪俱樂部) and is busy sparring with young people every day. Thus, when you see Mr. Yŏ coming to Paekhabwŏn on Chongno for lunch occasionally, his physique is robust enough to make even the dog days of July and August weep. <3>

Madam Hŏ Yŏng-suk (許英肅女史) = Due to her husband's affairs, she had temporarily suspended her studies while researching at the Tokyo Red Cross Hospital (東京 赤十字病院). She hastily came to Seoul last time and then went back, but in late August, she returned to Seoul with her children and is currently busy setting up a maternity clinic (産院) in Hyojadong.

Madam Na Hye-sŏk (羅惠錫女史) = Captivated by the beauty of the landscape and the charm of springs and rocks, she stayed in the Tongnae area all summer, holding her paintbrush, and is said to have completed several works during that time.

Mr. Wŏn Se-hun (元世勳氏) = Having assumed the presidency of the weekly newspaper "Chungang Sibo" (中央時報), he is wielding a vigorous pen in editorials and other writings, but he is suffering because his stomach ailment has not fully recovered.

Mr. Hŏ Hŏn (許憲氏) = Growing ever more robust in the scorching heat, he commutes daily to the Taedong Mining Company (大同鑛山會社) on Chongno 3-ch'ŏm. This is because he has taken the position of Standing Auditor (常務監査役) there.

Mr. Song Chin-u (宋鎭禹氏) = Gazing at the towering green pines of the Secret Garden (秘苑 - Piwŏn) just across the way while reading, he sometimes takes a rickshaw to the Tong-A Ilbo Company (東亞日報社) for casual, aimless chats with President Paek (白社長) before returning.

Mr. Sin T'ae-ak (申泰嶽氏) = Mr. Sin, renowned as a young lawyer, is busy traveling, sometimes even making trips to the provinces during this hot season – today Kwangju, tomorrow P'yŏngyang.

Mr. Sin Hŭng-u (申興雨氏) = Neither crying nor crowing for 5 or 6 years already, he remains quietly absorbed in religious contemplation and reading at his home in Sajikkol.

(Continued on Page 35) <4>

Mr. Kwŏn Tong-jin (權東鎭氏) = Although already 77 years old, his spirit surpasses that of the youth. However, unable to withstand the dog days of summer, his attendance at church has decreased recently, and he passes the time leaning on his desk in his grass-thatched study, keeping company with poetry, books, and the cool breeze.

Mr. Yun Ch'i-ho (尹致昊氏) = Mr. Yun, 74 years old. Lately, sweating profusely, he busily goes around, sometimes to the current affairs discussion meeting hosted by the Kyŏngsŏng Ilbo, sometimes to the lecture meeting at the youth hall.

Mr. Yi Chong-man (李鍾萬氏) = Having successfully completed the establishment of the 3 million won Taedong Mining Company (大同鑛業會社), he is now busy every day, coming out at sunrise and leaving at sunset, leading the many talented individuals under him.

Mr. Pang Ŭng-mo (方應模氏) = In these times of urgent national situation, he is extraordinarily busy attending to time-sensitive war reports and participating daily in various valuable meetings related to the current situation.

Mr. Sŏ Chŏng-hŭi (徐廷禧氏) = Having gone to Kwangju in Chŏlla Province, the mine he was operating reportedly turned out well, suggesting he might escape the life of a poor scholar in plain clothes. He is currently in Seoul.

Mr. Yi In (李仁氏) = There were frequent rumors about him running for office under the banner of a certain newspaper (모신문), but recently he opened a joint office with Mr. Kim Pyŏng-no (金炳魯氏) and is again dedicating his full efforts, busy in the legal circles.

Mr. Hong Myŏng-hŭi (洪命憙氏) = Settled in his house by the banks of the Han River (漢江), he spends his days cleanly, keeping company with poetry and books.

Mr. Yi Sŏng-hwan (李晟煥氏) = As a major shareholder of the Taedong Mining "Konzern" (大同鑛山 「콘체른」), he is energetically active in all directions (四面八方). He struggles on, unable even once to cool off by the riverside during the midsummer heat.

Mr. Paek Kwan-su (白寬洙氏) = As the chief executive of the troubled Tong-A Ilbo (東亞日報), which resumed publication after a long time, he has not a moment to spare amidst internal and external affairs.

Ms. Kim Hwal-lan (金活蘭氏) = While serving as the Master of Ceremonies at the inaugural meeting of the Patriotic Gold Hairpin Society (愛國金釵會), where upper-class ladies including wives of titled nobility gathered, she is also busy holding the teaching whip at Ewha Women's College (梨專 - Iwha Yŏjŏn).

Mr. Han Sang-nyong (韓相龍氏) = Having assumed the position of supreme advisor to the Kwantung Army (關東軍), he is busy not only with Manchukuo affairs but also extraordinarily active in Korean social affairs, as can be seen from his name appearing frequently in the newspapers daily.

Mr. Yi Tong-gu (李動求氏) = Having resigned from his position as professor at P'yŏngyang Sungsil College (平壤崇實專), he is now in Seoul, dedicating all his efforts to the organization and establishment of the Taedong Rural Society (大同農村社).

Mr. Ch'oe Rin (崔麟氏) = Leading the Sijunghoe (時中會), holding a key position in the new faction of Ch'ŏndogyo (天道教), and also serving as a Councilor of the Central Advisory Council (中樞院 參議). Growing more vigorous with age, he bustles about east and west, busily engaging with the youth. <35> <3-4, 35>

**Summary**

This article from the October 1937 issue of *Samch'ŏlli* provides brief updates on the activities of various prominent Korean figures across politics, business, law, arts, education, and social activism. It paints a picture of a society grappling with the escalating tensions of the era (just after the start of the full-scale Sino-Japanese War in July 1937), with individuals pursuing diverse paths ranging from engagement with Japanese/Manchukuo authorities and large-scale business ventures to cultural pursuits, legal practice, education, and quiet contemplation. For historians, the article offers valuable glimpses into the lives and choices of the Korean elite during a critical juncture in the colonial period. It highlights the spectrum of responses, from apparent collaboration (Pak Yŏng-ch'ŏl, Yun Ch'i-ho, Han Sang-nyong, Ch'oe Rin) and economic opportunism (Yi Chong-man, Yi Sŏng-hwan) to maintaining nationalist institutions under pressure (Song Chin-u, Paek Kwan-su at Tong-A Ilbo) and pursuing independent cultural or professional lives (Na Hye-sŏk, Hong Myŏng-hŭi, Yi In), reflecting the complex realities faced by Koreans under Japanese rule.
