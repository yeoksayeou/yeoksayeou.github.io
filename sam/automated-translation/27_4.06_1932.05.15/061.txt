**Summary**

This is an official announcement from the magazine *Samch'ŏlli* declaring the establishment of its South Manchuria General Branch Office in Antung (now Dandong), effective May 1st, 1932. It lists the key personnel, including the branch manager, reporters (including a female reporter), and clarifies that the branch will handle sales and advertising distribution throughout South Manchuria.
