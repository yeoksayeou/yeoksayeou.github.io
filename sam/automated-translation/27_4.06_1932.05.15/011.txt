Samch'ŏlli Company Announcement <5>

**Summary**

This is an official announcement from the Samch'ŏlli company regarding the establishment of its new branch office in Tianjin, China. It details the branch's name, specific address within the Japanese-French Concession border area, its geographical area of responsibility (Tianjin and Peiping), and lists the key personnel appointed, including the branch head, reporters, and advisors. For historians, this announcement is significant as it documents the expansion of a major Korean cultural enterprise (Samch'ŏlli magazine) into China during the colonial period. It highlights the presence and activities of Koreans in major Chinese cities like Tianjin and Peiping, reflecting the growing Korean diaspora and the magazine's effort to connect with overseas Koreans, potentially serving informational or even nationalistic purposes within that community.
