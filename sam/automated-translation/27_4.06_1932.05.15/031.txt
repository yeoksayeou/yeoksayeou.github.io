Company Notice

Regarding the An Tosan (安島山) Memoirs,
the contributions by
Yun Ch'iho (尹致昊)
Hŏ Hŏn (許憲)
Hong Yangmyŏng (洪陽明)
Kim Hyŏngsik (金瀅植)
- these four individuals' writings have unavoidably been suspended from publication.
Samch'ŏlli Company Notice <7>

**Summary**

This is a brief notice from the Samch'ŏlli Company, publishers of the magazine *Samch'ŏlli*, announcing the suspension of publication for contributions by Yun Ch'iho, Hŏ Hŏn, Hong Yangmyŏng, and Kim Hyŏngsik, which were intended for a section titled "An Tosan Memoirs." The notice states this suspension was unavoidable (不得已). For historians, this notice is interesting as it documents an editorial decision, possibly influenced by external pressure or censorship, affecting specific prominent figures during the colonial period. The mention of "An Tosan" (likely referring to An Ch'angho, whose pen name was Tosan) and the specific individuals whose writings were stopped could provide insight into the political sensitivities and publishing challenges of the time.
