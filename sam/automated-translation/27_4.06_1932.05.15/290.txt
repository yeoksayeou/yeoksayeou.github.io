Editor's Miscellaneous Notes

Regarding the enthusiastic welcome from our readers (강호) for the changes in format and price reduction of this magazine, we can only further strengthen our resolve to repay this kindness even after death (결초보은). However, the fact that the mid-May issue was only released on the 19th is because, although editing and censorship were completely finished before May 10th, due to circumstances at the printing house, an unexpected ten days were wasted on printing, causing it to come out late like this. We apologize. Starting with the early June issue, we will pay closer attention to the printing aspect and will definitely publish on the scheduled date.

Among the items previously announced, the "Danish Gymnastics Method" (丁抹操體法) bookbinding was delayed due to unexpected circumstances, but it will be released on the 25th. "Peace and Freedom" (평화와 자유), which had long been out of print, will also come out on the 25th. The "New Literature Anthology" (新文學選集) and the "Poetry Colleagues Anthology" (詩歌同人集) have been slightly delayed due to censorship matters. We ask for the understanding of those gentlemen (諸氏) who have requested them.

While asking you to look forward to the splendid early June issue, we also wish for everyone's health during the summer season. Branch Office Recruitment) <42>

**Summary**

This editorial note apologizes to readers for the delayed publication of the mid-May 1932 issue of Samch'ŏlli magazine. Despite format changes and a price reduction receiving a warm welcome, printing issues caused a ten-day delay after editing and censorship were completed. It also updates readers on the delayed release of several announced books, explicitly citing "censorship matters" as a reason for the delay of two anthologies. For historians, this text offers direct evidence of the practical challenges faced by publishers in colonial Korea, including explicit mentions of both logistical printing problems and delays caused by the Japanese censorship apparatus impacting scheduled publications.
