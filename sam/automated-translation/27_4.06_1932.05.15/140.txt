Ms. Hŏ Chŏngsuk's Appointment as Director of the Sun Lamp Therapy Research Institute (太陽燈療法硏究所長 就任)
Ms. Hŏ Chŏngsuk (許貞淑女史), who gained great fame in her generation as a female social activist, after being released from prison, settled in Samch'ŏngdong (三淸洞), a place with good water and beautiful mountains, and has been striving to restore her health, which weakened during her imprisonment. Recent word has it that she is to be appointed as the director of a research institute. When one hears "research institute," one might associate it with the Taewŏn Social Issues Research Institute (大原社會問題硏究所), but this is not such an institute of social science; rather, it is an institute of natural science. Specifically, it is said that a treatment and research facility will be established to practice a physical therapy (物理的療法) that treats the sick and strengthens the weak by receiving sunlight (太陽光線), which is currently very popular in America (亞米利加) and Europe (歐羅巴), and she will become its chief executive. Already, a thatched house (草家집) located at the entrance to Samch'ŏngdong from Kwanghwamun (光化門) has been purchased and demolished, and it has been decided to build a three-story Western-style building (洋層三層) there with a budget of 5,000 won. The Kŏnyangsa (建陽社) construction company reportedly undertook the contract (請負) the other day and is busy moving earth and stones.
Soon, we will be able to witness the vibrant presence of Director Hŏ (許院長).

Ms. Pak Hojin's Release from Prison (朴昊辰女史의 出監)
Ms. Pak Hojin (朴昊辰女史) was also released from prison a short while ago after washing away several years of prison hardship (獄苦), and she was quite healthy.
With Ms. Hŏ Chŏngsuk out, Ms. Ko Myŏngja out, and now Ms. Pak Hojin also out, it feels as though the desolate ranks (陳客) of women are being restored.
The only one remaining in prison is Ms. Chŏng Chongmyŏng (鄭鐘鳴女史), but in the letters she sends to her beloved son, Master Pak Hongje (朴弘濟君), she reportedly still writes cheerful and optimistic (樂天的) words, so it seems we will likely see the smiling face (얼골) of Ms. Chŏng (鄭女史) before long.

**Summary**

This news article reports on the post-prison activities of prominent female social activists in 1932 Korea. Hŏ Chŏngsuk, recently released, is establishing a "Sun Lamp Therapy Research Institute" in Samch'ŏngdong, focusing on physical therapy using sunlight, a trend from the West. The article details the construction plans. It also notes the recent release of another activist, Pak Hojin, expressing hope for the revitalization of the women's movement ranks, now that Hŏ, Pak, and Ko Myŏngja are free. It mentions Chŏng Chongmyŏng is still imprisoned but remains optimistic, awaiting her release. For historians, this piece highlights the resilience and shifting focus of female activists during the colonial period, moving from direct social/political action (implied by their imprisonment) towards health and scientific pursuits, possibly as a means of continued public engagement under surveillance. It also shows the adoption of Western trends (heliotherapy) and provides glimpses into the personal lives and networks of these important figures.

佳人春秋
許貞淑女史의 太陽燈療法硏究所長 就任
女流社會運動家러 一代에 盛名을 날니든 許貞淑女史는 出獄한 뒤 물조코 산이 秀麗한 三淸洞에 자리를 잡고서 옥중에서 지친 건강을 바로잡기에 애쓰더니 최근 들니는 말에 硏究所長에 취임하게 되엇다 한다. 硏究所라 하면 大原社會問題硏究所를 聯想할 터이나 그런 社會科學의 硏究所가 아니고 이것은 自然科學의 硏究所라 즉 요지음 亞米利加나 歐羅巴에서 大流行 하는 太陽光線을 밧어 病者를 治療하고 약한 자를 건강하게 하는 그런 물리적 療法을 施行하는 治療兼 硏究所를 설립하고 그의 최고책임자가 되리라 한다. 벌서 光化門에서 三淸洞 드러가는 於口에 잇는 草家집 한 채를 사서 헐고 거기에다가 5000원의 예산으로 洋層3層으로 짓기로 되어서 建陽社에서 日前에 請負까지 마터 흙날느고 돌날는다고 한다.
不日에 우리는 許院長의 씩씩한 姿態를 발견할 수 잇슬 것이다.

朴昊辰女史의 出監
朴昊辰女史도 여러 해의 獄苦를 씻고 얼마전에 出獄하엿는데 퍽으나 건강하엿다.
許貞淑氏 나오고 高明子氏 나오고 이제  朴昊辰氏 마저 나오니 蕭條하든 女性의 陳客이 다시 바로 잡어지는 듯.
옥에 남어잇는 이로는 鄭鐘鳴女史 한 사람 인데 그 愛息 朴弘濟君에게 나오는 편지에도 여전히 快活하고 樂天的 말을 썻드라 하니 잘 웃는 鄭女史의 얼골도 멀지 안어서 대하게 될 듯.(寫眞은 鄭鐘鳴)＜20＞
