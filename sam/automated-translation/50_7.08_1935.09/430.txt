Yohan
Though I have never seen you,
upon meeting, your face is familiar;
Though I have never waited,
you are the beloved I have long yearned for.

I wonder if Heaven
sent you, my only one.

Meeting by chance while coming and going,
I cannot say all the words I wish to;
Though my heart is full,
there is no way to convey it all.

In a future day, when Heaven comes <246>
I wonder if we shall meet again.

Though the path you take is busy,
can you not linger?
This body, bound by small matters,
resents the time.

Even while enduring, this hand once held,
I cannot bring myself to let go.<247>

**Summary**

This poem by Yohan expresses the profound and immediate connection felt upon meeting someone who seems like a destined friend or soulmate ("벗"). Despite never having met before, there's instant familiarity and a sense of long-held affection. The encounter is bittersweet, as circumstances ("small matters," "busy path") prevent a longer meeting, leaving many words unsaid and feelings unexpressed. The speaker longs for a future reunion and cherishes the brief physical contact, finding it hard to part. For historians, the poem offers insight into personal sentiments during the colonial period. While seemingly a simple lyric about friendship or love, the themes of constrained time, unspoken feelings, and yearning for a future meeting ("when Heaven comes") could potentially reflect broader societal restrictions and hopes for liberation or a better future, albeit expressed subtly through a personal lens.

요한
뵈온 적 업건마는
만나매 낫 닉으며
기둔적 업건마는
오래그린 임이로다

하늘이 내 하나인 임을
보내신가 하노라

가다오다 만낫스매
하올 말슴 다 못하네
가슴에 가득컨만
전할 길 업으오라

훗날에 하늘이 오면 <246>
만나올가 하노라

가는 길 바쁘지만
머물지는 못할건가
적은 일에 매인 몸이
시간을 원망하네

참아도 한번 잡은 손
노치 못해 하노라<247>
<246-247>
