Heard Tidings/Rumors (드른 風月記)

Between Brother-Sister and Dr. Yi Sŭngman (李承晩)

Mr. Kim Sŏngsu (金性洙) and Mr. Song Chinu (宋鎭禹) are not siblings or anything of the sort, yet a rumor frequently circulates in the world that the two are brother and sister. This isn't just said within Korea; it has spread far abroad, sometimes causing the two gentlemen wry smiles (苦笑).
Perhaps it was over ten years ago now, when Mr. Kim Sŏngsu went to Hawaii (布哇) as a representative with a group including Mr. Yun Ch'iho (尹致昊) for the Pacific Conference (大平洋會義). At that time, in some private setting, Dr. Yi Sŭngman was introducing Mr. Kim to the resident compatriots (在留同胞) there and said something like, "Speaking of Mr. Kim Sŏngsu, he is the brother in a brother-sister relationship with Mr. Song Chinu..." Mr. Kim gave a wry smile (苦笑) and explained that this was not true. Then, on the following day (翌日), when he was scheduled to give a speech at a public gathering where many compatriots had assembled, Dr. Yi again addressed the audience, saying, "Mr. Kim is Mr. Song Chinu's brother-in-law (처남)..." insisting on the sibling theory and making Mr. Kim give a wry smile (苦笑) once again.

Yun Ch'iho (尹致昊) and Sin Hŭngu (申興雨)

While we're on the subject, let's relay one more mistaken report (誤傳). There is a rumor among some that Mr. Yun Ch'iho bought the house in Sajik-dong (社稷洞) for Mr. Sin Hŭngu. In reality, Mr. Yun never bought it for him; Mr. Sin first bought a six-kan thatched house (草家六間) for perhaps 200 or 300 won, then gradually expanded (증축하여) it to create the residence of today. It is said that it was bought purely (순전히) with Mr. Sin's own money (제돈).

Na Tohyang's (羅稻香) Tenth Death Anniversary

As it is already (於焉) the 10th anniversary of the passing of the writer Na Pin (羅彬), pen name Tohyang (稻香), various figures from the literary world (文壇諸氏) who were close to him during his life are reportedly preparing to hold a 10th-anniversary memorial service sometime between September and October.<53>

**Summary**

This article relays anecdotes and clarifies rumors surrounding prominent Korean figures in 1935. It corrects the misconception that Kim Sŏngsu and Song Chinu were siblings, recounting Yi Sŭngman's persistent, mistaken introductions of Kim as Song's brother or brother-in-law in Hawaii years earlier. It also debunks the rumor that Yun Ch'iho purchased Sin Hŭngu's house, stating Sin bought and expanded it himself. Finally, it notes preparations for a 10th-anniversary memorial service for the writer Na Tohyang (Na Pin). For historians, the article offers insights into the social circles and public perception of key nationalist and intellectual figures like Yi Sŭngman, Kim Sŏngsu, Song Chinu, Yun Ch'iho, and Sin Hŭngu during the colonial period. The persistence of rumors, even abroad, and the correction thereof in print, reflect the public interest in these individuals, while the planned memorial for Na Tohyang highlights cultural activities and remembrance within the literary community at the time.

드른 風月記
男妹間과 李承晩 博士

金性洙씨와 宋鎭禹씨는 남매간도 아모 것도 아닌데 세상에서는 번번히 두 분이 남매간이란 설이 유포된다, 이 말은 조선내에서만 그런 것이 아니라 멀니 외국에 까지 흘너가서 두 분의 苦笑를 각금 사는 일이 잇다.
지금부터 십수년 전일가, 大平洋會義러 金性洙씨가 尹致昊씨 등 일행에 끼여 대표로 布哇로 갓다, 그때 어느 사석에서 李承晩博士가 그곳 在留同胞에게 金氏를 소개할 적에 「金性洙氏로 말하면 宋鎭禹氏와 남매간 사이로서...」운운하엿다 金氏는 苦笑하면서 아니라고 변명하엿더니 그 翌日 多數同胞가 모힌 공석에서 연설하기로 되엇슬 적에 李박사가 또 청중을 향하야 「金氏는 宋鎭禹씨의 처남으로서...」하고 남매설을 주장하야 金氏로 하여곰 거듭 苦笑케 하엿단다.

尹致昊氏와 申興雨

말하든 까리니 誤傳 한가지 더 전하자. 尹致昊씨가 申興雨씨를 위하야 그 社稷洞 집을 사주엇다는설이 일부 세간에 잇는데 실상은 尹氏가 사준 일이 업고 申氏가 처음 200원인가 300원인가 주고 草家六間을 삿다가 그것을 작고 증축하여 오늘의 주택을 만든 것으로 순전히 申氏 제돈으로 산 것이라고.

羅稻香의 十週忌

작가, 稻香 羅彬氏가 이 세상을 떠난지 於焉 10주년을 마지하엿슴으로 생전에 갓가히 지내든 文壇諸氏의 손으로 10주년 추도회를 9,10월간으로 개최코저 준비중이라 한다.<53>
