Establishment of a New Post Office Box

As our company grows daily, we have now specially arranged for a Post Office Box (Kwanggwamun Post Office Box No. 46) for the prompt receipt and safety of postal items. We hope you will make much use of it.

Kyŏngsŏng Kwanghwamun Post Office Box No. 46
Samch'ŏlli Sa <185>

**Summary**

This is a brief announcement from the *Samch'ŏlli* magazine company informing its readers and correspondents that it has established a post office box (No. 46) at the Kwanghwamun Post Office in Kyŏngsŏng (colonial Seoul). The purpose is to ensure faster and more secure mail delivery as the company expands. For historians, this notice reflects the growth and professionalization of a significant Korean cultural publication during the colonial period. The use of a P.O. box suggests an increasing volume of mail and a need for efficient business operations within the constraints of the colonial postal system. It also subtly points to the company's presence and activity in the colonial capital, Kyŏngsŏng.
