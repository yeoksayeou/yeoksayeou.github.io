From the mountains, the sea looks good (죠코);
From the sea, the mountains look good (죠코).
Everywhere I go (온듸간듸) looks good (죠와도),
Where (어듸다) should I build my home?

Just because you have it (잇다고), doesn't mean you should flaunt it (잇는척);
Just because you lack it (업다고), doesn't mean you should envy.
There are no fools (못난이) in the world,
Let's live in our own prime (저잘난 성수에 사라보리).

Can a departed love (죽어간 님) be called love (님)?
Can a torn (뚤어진) shoe-sole (신짝) be called a shoe (신)?
On the burnt stump (불탄등걸) of Apnamsan (압남산),
Mites (좀) infest where leaves (닙) once budded.<246>

**Summary**

These three short, posthumously published poems by Kim Sowŏl touch upon themes of longing for a place, detachment from worldly judgments, and the melancholy of decay and loss. The speaker contemplates where to settle between the appealing mountain and sea, advises against both arrogance in having and envy in lacking, and observes the irreversible nature of loss through images of a dead lover, a ruined shoe, and an infested tree stump. From a historical perspective, these poems, appearing shortly after Sowŏl's death during the Japanese colonial period, might offer insight into personal feelings of displacement, resignation, or a search for inner peace amidst external hardship, sentiments potentially reflective of the era, even if expressed universally. The preservation of early 20th-century Korean vernacular and spelling is also significant for linguistic study.

小曲三篇(遺稿)
						金素月


뫼에서 보면 바다이죠코
바다에서는 뫼가 죠코
온듸간듸 다 죠와도
어듸다 내집을 지어둘고.



잇다고 잇는척 못할일이
업다고 부러워 안할일이
세상에 못난이 업는 것이
저잘난 성수에 사라보리.



죽어간 님을 님이래랴
뚤어진 신짝을 신이래랴
압남산에 불탄등걸
닙피든 자국에 좀이드네.<246>
