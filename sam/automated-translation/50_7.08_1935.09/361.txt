**Summary**

This short piece lists four individuals – Kim Myŏngsik, Pak Indŏk, Kim Hyŏngwŏn, and Yi In – each paired with a four-character Hanja phrase evoking a distinct, poetic image (like "Autumn Water, One Sword" or "Long Rainbow Between Clouds"). The author is identified by the pen name Sŏksil Kŏsa ("Stone Room Layman"). For historians, this article offers a glimpse into the literary sensibilities and use of classical Chinese expressions in 1930s Korea. The specific individuals named and the imagery associated with them might provide clues about their perceived character or public image at the time.
