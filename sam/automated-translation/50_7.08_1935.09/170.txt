드른 風月記
柳光烈씨의 헝거스트라익

The critic Mr. Yu Kwang-nyŏl (柳光烈) invariably refuses to eat as a protest movement after quarreling with his wife. On holidays, he pulls the covers over his head and lies down all day long, and on workdays, he skips breakfast and rushes off to the newspaper company (新聞社). Then his wife, a graduate of a Female High School (女高), completely yields, presses her palms together in supplication before her husband, and offers unconditional surrender. Since this tactic proves successful every single time it is used, how about all husbands under their wives' thumbs (妻侍下) learning this secret technique? However, the wars between Mr. and Mrs. Yu are said to arise from the wife's plea, "Please, I can endure anything you do, just don't have other women," which the heartless Mr. Yu swerves away from like the character '之' (galjija), sometimes engaging in "overseas development" (海外 發展).

元翊常氏와 朴仁德

This autumn, for the World Christian Conference opening in the United States (米國), an invitation and travel expenses arrived from the US headquarters requesting Ms. Pak In-dŏk (朴仁德) from Korea to attend. Consequently, one day, while Ms. Pak In-dŏk was busy with departure preparations in her office, Rev. Won Ik-sang (元翊常), a prominent figure in the Christian community (基督敎界), appeared and protested, saying, "I hear you are going to the United States; with whose permission are you going? Do not go." Ms. Pak retorted, "Whether I go or not, what business is it of yours?" "The Korean Christian Society (朝鮮 基督敎 社會) never selected you as a representative, so why are you presumptuously saying you are going as the Korean representative?" "You heard incorrectly. I am not going as the Korean representative, but as my own representative, so who are you to tell me to go or not go!" <93>

**Summary**

This article presents two short anecdotes. The first describes critic Yu Kwang-nyŏl's tactic of using hunger strikes to win arguments with his wife, who pleads with him to stop having affairs (euphemistically called "overseas development"). The second recounts an incident where Rev. Won Ik-sang confronts Pak In-dŏk, questioning her right to attend a World Christian Conference in the US as she wasn't officially chosen by the Korean Christian Society, to which she replies she is attending in her personal capacity. From a historical perspective, the article offers glimpses into marital dynamics and social commentary (infidelity, gender roles, the status of a "Female High School graduate") in 1930s Korea. Furthermore, the dispute over Pak In-dŏk's representation at an international conference highlights internal politics within the Korean Christian community during the colonial period and issues of individual versus organizational representation on the world stage.
