Among our dear readers, there are sometimes those who look for past issues of Samch'ŏlli, but currently, at our company headquarters, they are all sold out (絶品), and we barely have only this year's March and July issues available.<205>

**Summary**

This brief company announcement (社告) from the September 1935 issue of Samch'ŏlli magazine informs readers that almost all back issues are sold out (絶品), with only the March and July issues from that year remaining available at the company headquarters. For historians, this note highlights the potential scarcity of published materials during the colonial period. It could reflect high readership demand for Samch'ŏlli, limited print runs due to costs or material shortages, distribution difficulties, or possibly even suppression or confiscation of certain issues by authorities, all of which were characteristic challenges for Korean publications under Japanese rule.
