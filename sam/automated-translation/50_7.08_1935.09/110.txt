修心 (Cultivating the Mind)

萬障塵巷欲尋眞
鏡水風光新罷霧
防護心城慧月晨
牛山木孽復歸春
却醒放逸悖人道
太上曉燈迷夢覺
每向淸和除客塵
一片靈丹壽斯民

Seeking truth amidst the ten thousand obstructions of dusty alleys,
The scenery of the mirror-like water is fresh as the mist lifts.
Protect the mind's fortress; the moon of wisdom is the dawn.
The felled trees of Ox Mountain return again in spring.
Awaken from indulgence that violates the human way.
The supreme dawn lamp awakens one from deluded dreams.
Always turn towards clarity and harmony to remove worldly dust.
A piece of the elixir of immortality grants longevity to this people.

戒言 (Words of Warning)

我有輕輕三寸舌
鵠何墮鱉鱉何墮
舌上自然斤鐵生
桑不烹黽黽不烹
表情當避傷身斧
莫道皇天無際遠
臨事先巡防意城
私談聽若巨雷聲

I have a light, three-inch tongue.
Why did the crane fall? Why did the turtle fall?
On the tongue, naturally, an axe and iron arise.
The mulberry does not cook the frog; the frog does not cook.
In expressing oneself, one must avoid the axe that harms the body.
Do not say that High Heaven is limitlessly far.
When facing matters, first patrol the fortress of intention.
Listen to private talk as if it were the sound of great thunder.

節慾 (Controlling Desire)

知足自財貧亦樂
樹多美實行人折
六根耆好莫增長
蜜付利刀舐者傷
休道繁陰三夏綠
祗園晨夕觀心海
奈何殘葉元秋黃
慾浪將翻焚戒香<71>
<70-71>
Knowing contentment is wealth itself; even poverty brings joy.
A tree with too much fine fruit is broken by passersby.
Do not increase the desires of the six senses.
He who licks honey from a sharp knife gets injured.
Do not speak of the lush shade of the three summer months' green.
At Jetavana Monastery, morning and evening, observe the ocean of the mind.
What can be done about the withered leaves, yellow in prime autumn?
When the waves of desire are about to surge, burn the incense of precepts.<71>

**Summary**

These three poems by Yun Ik-sŏn, titled "Cultivating the Mind," "Words of Warning," and "Controlling Desire," offer moral and spiritual guidance rooted in Buddhist and Confucian principles. They emphasize introspection, the purification of mind from worldly distractions, the dangers of careless speech, and the importance of moderating desires for inner peace and longevity. The poems use classical allusions and metaphors to advocate for self-discipline and contentment. From a historical perspective, the focus on individual self-cultivation and moral rectitude during the colonial period (1935) might reflect a turn inward when external political or social agency was limited, finding solace and strength in traditional ethical frameworks. Historians might find the blend of traditional philosophy and its expression in a popular magazine during this era noteworthy.
