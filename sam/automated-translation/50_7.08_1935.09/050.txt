**Summary**

This article, titled "Short Sketches of Brilliance" by the pseudonymous author "Sŏksil Kŏsa," presents a list of prominent Korean figures from 1935. Each individual is characterized by a poetic four-character Hanja phrase, offering a metaphorical glimpse into their perceived personality, status, or role in society. The figures range from politicians and activists to intellectuals and cultural figures. For colonial Korean history, this piece is interesting as it reflects contemporary perceptions (or perhaps the author's specific view) of major personalities through traditional literary metaphors, hinting at their public image or perhaps subtly critiquing or praising them within the constraints of the era. Historians might find the choice of metaphors for figures like Yun Ch'iho, An Ch'angho, Yŏ Unhyŏng, or Kim Sŏngsu particularly revealing about how they were viewed or portrayed in the mid-1930s.
