Short Colorful Sketches
						by Sŏksil Kŏsa

Ch'unwŏn's Peaches and Plums: Yi Kwangsu

Turning Head Golden Buddha: Hyŏn Sangyun

Hundred Turns, Hundred Rises: Kang Kidŏk<121>

**Summary**

This brief piece lists three prominent figures of the time – Yi Kwangsu, Hyŏn Sangyun, and Kang Kidŏk – each associated with a four-character descriptive phrase. Yi Kwangsu (pen name Ch'unwŏn) is linked to "Peaches and Plums," suggesting disciples or influence. Hyŏn Sangyun is likened to a "Turning Head Golden Buddha," perhaps implying wisdom or enlightenment with a dynamic aspect. Kang Kidŏk is characterized by "Hundred Turns, Hundred Rises," signifying resilience or numerous ups and downs. From a historical perspective, this is interesting as it provides succinct, contemporary characterizations or perhaps widely recognized nicknames for these individuals within Korean society during the colonial period, offering a glimpse into how they were perceived.
