**Body Text Translation**
We have greeted the fine season of September, when the yellow chrysanthemums and crimson maples ripen. Now is the time to read books, the time to think, and the time to long for those who have gone far away. The time has come to gather the emotions that were scattered throughout spring and summer. Please spend this time valuably, everyone.

The first distributed volume of the "Collected Works of Ch'unwŏn" (春園全集), "That Woman's Life" (그 女子의 一生), has truly received an ardent welcome; everywhere, Kim Pong (金鳳) is the talk of the town. This name, Kim Pong, is about to become a name that pulls most strongly at our hearts. It is a joyous thing. We too wish to have names from literary history that are world-famous, like Kak Chusa (각주사 - likely referring to the poet Zhu Shuzhen) or Juliet (쥬리엣). It seems such a name might be found in Kim Pong, the protagonist of "That Woman's Life." Indeed. <300>

**Summary**

This editorial postscript from the September 1935 issue of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine welcomes the autumn season and expresses gratitude for the enthusiastic reception of the first volume of the "Collected Works of Ch'unwŏn" (likely Yi Kwangsu), specifically his work "That Woman's Life." The editors celebrate the emerging popularity of the protagonist, Kim Pong, expressing hope that this character might achieve enduring fame comparable to international literary figures like Zhu Shuzhen or Juliet. From a historical perspective, the piece is interesting as it reflects the cultural environment of colonial Korea, particularly the promotion of contemporary Korean literature (Yi Kwangsu's work) and the aspiration for Korean literary characters to gain recognition on par with world literature, even while framed within the context of Japanese colonial rule. The enthusiastic promotion of Yi Kwangsu, a major but later controversial figure due to collaboration, is also notable.
