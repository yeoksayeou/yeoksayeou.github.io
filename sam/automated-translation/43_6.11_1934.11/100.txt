Many people would likely be surprised if they heard there was a time when a British bank existed in Chosŏn. Specifically, in 1900, Mr. Kkol-buran (꼴-부란氏), an Englishman who started the electricity and waterworks business, consulted with the Korean (韓國) government of that time and founded the Kkol-buran Bank (꼴-부란銀行). It is said that its office back then was located where the former Chongno (鍾路) Police Station used to be. <47>

**Summary**

This short article notes the surprising fact that a British-associated bank, the "Collbran Bank" (꼴-부란銀行), existed in Seoul (Jongno) around 1900. It was founded by Mr. Collbran (꼴-부란氏), an Englishman involved in developing Seoul's electricity and waterworks infrastructure, in consultation with the contemporary Korean government. The bank's office was reportedly situated at the former location of the Jongno Police Station. For historians, this piece highlights early Western involvement, specifically British, in Korean infrastructure development and finance during the late Korean Empire period, preceding deeper Japanese colonial influence. It points to the intersection of foreign enterprise, infrastructure projects, and financial institutions in Korea at the turn of the 20th century.
