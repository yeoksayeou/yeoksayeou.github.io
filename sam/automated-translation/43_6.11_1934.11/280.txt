戀愛小史
便紙三百張去來
It is said that the number of love letters exchanged between Ch'unwŏn and Miss Hŏ Yŏngsuk (since she was a 'Miss' back then) reached 300. According to Ch'unwŏn, Miss Yŏngsuk, an outside woman, wrote to him first. According to Miss Yŏngsuk, Ch'unwŏn first sent a letter initiating romance to her, a well-bred maiden, so she replied. Whether "the bell rings or the bell hammer rings" (鍾か嗚るか橦子が嗚るか) is ultimately impossible to know, but anyway, it's said there are many masterpieces of writing within those love letters, and the two decided to reveal them when they both have white hair in their 70s or 80s and are called grandfather and grandmother. <110>

柳東悅따라 劉永淑 北京行
At that time, Major Yu Tongyŏl, after graduating from the Military Academy in Tokyo and also serving in the Russo-Japanese War, returned and worked as a young adjutant under the Minister of War. Whenever he had time, full of spirit, he would ride his white horse with a golden saddle around the main streets of Changan (Seoul) as if they were too narrow. The modern women of the time burned with passion for the imposing presence of this young officer. Among them, the most ardent was Miss Yu Yŏngsuk, who had returned from studying in Tokyo. When Mr. Yu later went into exile in Beijing, she followed him without question and became his wife. <112>

李甲따라 劉孃 出發
Yu Yŏngsuk, who carried her bundles and followed Yu Tongyŏl all the way to Beijing to become his wife, has a younger sister, Miss Yu XX. This Miss Yu, in turn, ran off to Beijing following Yi Kap, who was then a young officer and adjutant to the Minister of War. However, in this "love affair involving travel" (出張戀愛), the older sister succeeded and became Yu Tongyŏl's wife, while the younger sister failed and came back. <114>

玄鼎健따라 桂玉
Around the time of the March First Movement (己未), there was a famous gisaeng in Changan named Hyŏn Kyeok, skilled at the kŏmun'go and dancing. Said to be the uterine sister of female activist Chŏng X-sŏng, many suitors flocked, captivated by her butterfly-like face. At that time, after coaxing 2,000 Won from the son of a certain wealthy aristocrat, she ran off to Beijing with her beloved lover Hyŏn Chŏnggŏn, who was then a fighter for the movement. After Hyŏn was caught, imprisoned, and later died of illness, she is said to have dashed off to Moscow and is now active as a female X member (女X員) in some organization (某機關). <116>

東京 三美人 行方
Female novelist Miss Kim Myŏngsun, Miss Kang Sukryŏl of Mejiro University, and Miss Hwang Kwikyŏng of Ochanomizu Women's Higher Normal School were called the "Three Beauties" in the Tokyo international student community back in their day. As for their fates, Miss Hwang Kwikyŏng became the wife of Mr. Chŏng Haknyŏn, a tennis player who attended the Commerce College (商大); Miss Kang Sukryŏl became the wife of the critic Kim P'albong; and Miss Kim Myŏngsun, after a "love pilgrimage" involving Kim Ch'anyŏng, Im Nowŏl, and others, still remains in Tokyo. <118>
<110-118>

**Summary**

This article compiles short anecdotes about the love lives and relationships of several prominent Korean figures from the early 20th century. It recounts the prolific letter exchange between writer Ch'unwŏn (Yi Kwangsu) and Hŏ Yŏngsuk; the elopements of Yu Yŏngsuk with military officer Yu Tongyŏl and her sister with Yi Kap to Beijing (one successful, one not); the story of famous gisaeng Hyŏn Kyeok running away to Beijing with independence activist Hyŏn Chŏnggŏn and later moving to Moscow; and the romantic paths of three women known as the "Three Beauties" among Korean students in Tokyo. The article offers glimpses into the personal lives and romantic choices of intellectuals, artists, activists, and military men during the Japanese colonial period. Historians might find it interesting for its portrayal of changing social norms around courtship and marriage, the mobility and interconnectedness of Korean elites and activists across East Asia (Tokyo, Beijing, Moscow), and the intersection of personal relationships with political exile and activism.
