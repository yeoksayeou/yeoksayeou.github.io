朝鮮의 海軍兵學校 (Chosŏn's Naval Academy)

There are knowledgeable people (識者) who think, "Since Chosŏn (朝鮮) is a peninsula surrounded by the ocean on three sides, even the most ignorant Korean government (韓國政府) would surely have thought of establishing something like a Naval Academy..." That is indeed true.

In 1894, the Korean government planned to establish a Naval Academy (海軍兵學校) on Kanghwa Island (江華島) and invited the Englishman Mr. Hutchison (하지슨氏) as an English instructor, along with 4 or 5 British officers (英國士官) such as Goll (골) and Well (웰). However, while preparations for opening the school were underway, the Sino-Japanese War (日淸戰爭) suddenly broke out, and it was unavoidably suspended. <48>

**Summary**

This short article from 1934 notes that despite being a peninsula, Korea (Chosŏn) lacked a naval academy. It reveals that the Korean government had concrete plans in 1894 to establish one on Kanghwa Island, hiring British instructors (Mr. Hutchison, Goll, Well, and others). However, the outbreak of the First Sino-Japanese War forced the cancellation of these plans. For historians, this piece highlights a specific, albeit failed, attempt at military modernization by the late Chosŏn government, influenced by Western models (British advisors) and ultimately thwarted by regional conflict, underscoring the precarious geopolitical situation Korea faced at the turn of the century.
