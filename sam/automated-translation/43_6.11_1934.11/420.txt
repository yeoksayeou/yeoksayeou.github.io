Autumn Sounds in the Old Palace
						Wŏlt'an

Autumn Sounds in the Old Palace
The moon is cold in the Old Palace (故宮),
Only the foundations remain of the halls and pavilions.
The wind strikes the trees, autumn sounds rise from every branch.
Where that sound arises, the ground is thick with fallen leaves.
The falling leaves, the blowing wind, all are desolate, alas.

The Fields Are Fertile
In the late rice of the 8th month, the fields (田園) are fertile.
The sorghum bows its head, the fields are full of golden waves.
Chestnut burrs silently burst open in the back garden,
And crab legs in chrysanthemum soup grow plump.
By the stream, a calf calls out, "Mama—"
With a flushed face under a pink skirt, she went gathering cotton.

Jade Hairpin Flower (玉簪花)
Do you know the name of the white flower like a hairpin? <214>
It is called the Jade Hairpin Flower (玉簪花), blooming every autumn,
Smiling fragrantly in the gently blowing west wind.
Who is there to recognize it? Only a scholar dressed in hemp.

Spending an Autumn Night in a Mountain Hut
Lying in the mountain hut (山舍), a chill fills the room.
The dawn moon over the West Mountain creeps through the windowpane,
And the sound of the stream's water fades beside the pillow.
Trying to lead an idle guest's lonely dream to sleep,
But even the dream is cold, and drowsiness vanishes.

Autumn Colors on the Han River (漢江)
The white moon flows like the autumn water, flying by,
Cold fish coil themselves in the stony rapids (돍여을).
On the riverbank are maple leaves and reed flowers,
The sky is vast; the calls of wild geese, two or three cries.

Altair and Vega (牽牛織女)
In the ninety thousand *li* of the night sky, the Milky Way flows. <215>
By the banks of the winding river, there were two stars, male and female.
The two stars, burning with love, knew neither night nor day.
Heaven grew angry and banished one star.
Separated across the water, on opposite shores live the two stars.
The long autumn night (秋夜長) is long, hard to endure.
Meeting for just one day on the seventh day of the seventh month, granted by plea,
The hateful cock's crow hastens the dawning day.
Parting is hard, truly heart-wrenching.
Year after year, tears flow, only adding to the Milky Way. <216>
<214-216>

**Summary**

This collection by Wŏlt'an presents six poems centered on autumn themes. They evoke feelings of melancholy ("Autumn Sounds in the Old Palace"), depict serene rural abundance ("The Fields Are Fertile"), appreciate simple beauty ("Jade Hairpin Flower"), capture the loneliness of travel ("Spending an Autumn Night in a Mountain Hut"), paint a picturesque landscape ("Autumn Colors on the Han River"), and retell the classic myth of separated lovers ("Altair and Vega"). For historians, the poems offer insight into the persistence of traditional Korean aesthetics and sensibilities during the colonial period. The elegy for the "Old Palace" might subtly hint at national loss, while the focus on nature and folklore could represent a cultural refuge or a quiet assertion of Korean identity amidst foreign rule.

故宮秋聲
						月灘
故宮秋聲
故宮엔 달이차다
殿閣은 터전뿐을.
바람이 나무를치니 가지마다 추성일다
그소리 이는곧에 땅에가득 락엽일세
지는잎 부는바람이 모도다 을신연만 하구료.

田園이살졋구료
8月 느진볏에 田園이산젓구료
수수는 고개숙고 들에가득 金물결일세
밤송이 소리없이 동산에 터지고
방국에 게(蟹)다리 기름저서 나리네
시냇가에 송아지『엄마-』부르고
분홍치마 낫붉히며 면화따서 가더라.

玉簪花
비녀같은 흰꽃을 그대일홈아시나,＜214＞
불으기를 玉簪花 가을마다피여서
슬슬부는 西風에 향기로이 웃나니,
알어줄이 누구요 베옷입은 선빌세.

秋夜宿山舍
山舍에 누었으니 찬기운 방에돈다,
새벽 西山달은 窓鏡으로 기어들고
시내 물소리는 벼개엽헤 사러지네
노는손, 외로운꿈을 잇그러 자랴하니
꿈마저 차지는통에 조름조차 스러지데.

漢江秋色
흰달은 가을물로 흘러날으고
찬고기 돍여을에 몸을서리네
강언덕엔 단풍닢 갈대꽃인데
한울넓다 기럭소리 두서너마듸.

牽牛織女
밤한울 구만리엔 은하수가 흘은다오＜215＞
구비치는 강가에는 남녀 두 별있엇다오
사랑에 타는 두 별 밤과낯을 몰으것다,
한울이 성이나서 별하나를 쪼치시다.
물건너 한편바다 떠러저 사는 두 별
秋夜長 밤이길다 견듸기 어려워라.
칠석날 하로만을 청드러 만나보니
원수의 닭의소리 지새는날 재촉하네.
리별이 어려워라 진정으로 난감하다
해마다 눈물흘러 흔하수만 보태네.＜216＞
＜214-216＞
