Author: Not specified
Article Type: 잡저 (Miscellaneous Writing/Essay)

In the old days, during the Kwangmu (光武) era, the Royal Palace (王宮) was always guarded day and night (晝夜) by the Chosŏn (朝鮮) Army. At that time, specifically to protect the Emperor's (임굼) person (御身邊護衛코저), listening to the words of foreign advisors (外國人 顧問들), it was decided to recruit foreign guards (外國人 衛兵). An External Advisor (外部顧問), the American (米國人) Mr. Greathouse (구레-드, 하우스氏), purposely went to Shanghai (上海) in 1998. As a result of a newspaper advertisement (新聞 廣告), 30 people of various nationalities—British (英), American (米), German (獨), Italian (伊), and Austrian (墺)—responded. He brought them to Sŏul (서울) via Inch'ŏn (仁川), but the conduct (行事) of the foreign soldiers (外國兵) was nasty (고약하여), so they were reportedly given 100 Won (百圓式) each for travel expenses (旅費) and chased away (쪼차 보냇다고).<27>

**Summary**

This short piece recounts an attempt during Emperor Gojong's Kwangmu era to hire foreign palace guards based on the advice of foreign consultants. An American advisor named Greathouse recruited 30 Europeans in Shanghai in 1998 (likely a typo for 1898), but upon arrival in Seoul, their poor behavior led to their swift dismissal with severance pay. For historians, this anecdote illustrates the Korean Empire's efforts towards modernization involving foreign expertise, the practical difficulties encountered when interacting with foreigners, and the challenges in securing the Emperor's safety during a period of internal and external pressure. The apparent date error (1998) might also be of interest.
