General Blücher, Commander of the Red Army's Far Eastern Army
At this time when the storm clouds on the Manchukuo-Soviet border seem to be gradually intensifying, Blücher (뿌류엘), the Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Far Eastern Army who holds real power in his hands, is said to sufficiently possess the dignity to become the head of military affairs for a nation, second only to the Soviet People's Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs, Voroshilov (오로-시프).
He was born in 1889, making him 46 years old this year. Until the World War, he was working at a vehicle manufacturing plant, and in 1910, he instigated a strike, gaining the experience of being imprisoned for 2 years and 8 months as its ringleader.
With the outbreak of the Great War in 1914, he was conscripted and was discharged the following year after receiving severe injuries. Afterwards, he spent his time in labor at a shipyard (造般所) and a machine factory, joining the Social Democratic Party in 1916.
After the October Revolution, he was elected to the Samara (사마-라) Revolutionary Committee and fought fiercely leading a mixed detachment (混成支隊). Later, in 1921-2, he became the Commander-in-Chief and Chairman of the Military Council of the Far Eastern Republic, attended the Dalian Conference (大連會議) and the Beijing Naval Conference (北京海軍會議), served as the commander of the 1st Rifle Corps and the Leningrad (레닌그라-드) Garrison Commander, and since 1924, was active as the supreme military advisor to the Chinese Southern Government (中國南方政府).
He was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Red Army (赤軍) Far Eastern Army in 1929. Since then, until today, he has been rapidly strengthening the Far Eastern Army.
Furthermore, at this year's 17th Party Congress (黨 第17回大會), he gave an important report regarding the defense of the Far Eastern region and Japan-Manchukuo-Soviet (日滿蘇) relations, drawing even more public attention. <42>

United States Navy Admiral Pratt
The crisis of 1935-36 and the situation where the establishment of a Naval Disarmament Conference (海軍軍縮會議) seems unlikely are producing advocates for major naval expansion in both Britain and America (英米). The shipbuilding competition (建艦競爭) is proceeding, ignoring the current ratios. In particular, the U.S. Navy (米國海軍), stretching across both the Atlantic (太西洋) and Pacific (太平洋) oceans, is making strides in exercises intended to deploy the Atlantic fleet to the Pacific overnight via the Panama Canal (파나마運河), which has been called difficult navigation. Thus, many advocates for major expansion are appearing among active-duty naval admirals.
Admiral Pratt (푸랏트提督) is one of them. Admiral Pratt was born in 1866, making him 66 years old this year. He graduated from the United States Naval Academy (合衆國海軍大學) at the age of twenty, became an Ensign (旗手) in 1891, and was promoted to Rear Admiral (海軍小將) in June 1921. He served on the warship USS Chicago (시카코號), then served as an instructor at the Naval Academy (海軍大學敎官), and later fought in the Spanish-American War (米西戰爭) of 1898, winning fame for his bravery.
For two years starting in 1900, he again stood at the lecture platform of the Naval Academy (海軍大學), and then from 1902 to 1905, he was the flag captain of the Pacific Fleet (太平洋艦隊). Later, he became the Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet, and after serving as the commander of the Panama Canal defense fleet, he participated as a technical expert (技術專門家) in the Naval Disarmament Conference starting in 1921. He became a Vice Admiral (副提督) in 1927 and an Admiral (提督) in 1930.
The above is Admiral Pratt's brief profile. One must not forget the fact that he is an advocate of a large navy, and opinions within the United States Department of the Navy (合衆國海軍部) always move centered around him. <43>

**Summary**

This article profiles two prominent military figures of 1934: Vasily Blücher, Commander of the Soviet Far Eastern Army, and William V. Pratt, a US Navy Admiral. It details Blücher's rise from a factory worker and revolutionary to a key military leader strengthening Soviet defenses against Japan and Manchukuo. It also outlines Pratt's naval career, highlighting his role as an influential proponent of US naval expansion amid the perceived failure of disarmament talks and rising tensions, particularly in the Pacific. From a Korean colonial history perspective, the article is interesting as it reflects the intense geopolitical anxieties of the mid-1930s surrounding Manchuria and the Pacific, directly impacting Korea's situation under Japanese rule. The focus on Soviet and American military power, particularly concerning the Manchukuo border and naval capabilities in the Pacific, underscores the precarious position of Korea caught between expanding empires and ideologies.
