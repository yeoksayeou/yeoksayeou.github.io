社告
The policy has been decided to set the 15th of the preceding month as the standard actual release date for the 『三千里』 (Samch'ŏlli) magazine, and as this will be implemented starting from November, we unavoidably did not publish the October issue. The December issue will be published on November 15th, and the New Year issue on December 15th; as we will always publish in advance like this, we ask for the understanding (海諒) of our esteemed readers (愛讀者 諸氏).<68>

**Summary**

This announcement informs readers of the magazine *Samch'ŏlli* about a change in its publication schedule effective November 1934. The magazine will now be released on the 15th of the preceding month (e.g., the December issue on November 15th). Due to this change, the October 1934 issue was skipped. The notice asks for readers' understanding. For historians, this brief notice offers insight into the practical business operations of a major Korean magazine during the colonial period, including its distribution strategy (early release) and direct communication style with its readership regarding logistical changes. It reflects an effort to regularize and perhaps optimize circulation.
