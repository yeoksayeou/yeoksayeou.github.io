The Military Academy and This and That

The Korean Military Academy (韓國 陸軍士官學校) was opened in 1899. The school building's entrance was at the site of the Salvation Army Barracks (救世軍營) near the Sŏdaemun-jŏng Station (西大門町 停留場). Behind that, on the site of the Monopoly Bureau's official residences (專賣局 官舍), stood a magnificent building (宏壯한 建物). There were many foreign officers (外國人土官) as instructors; Ŏ Tam (漁담) (currently Lieutenant General), a native of Tōkyō (東京), and Cho Sŏng-gŭn (趙性根) (currently Lieutenant General) were instructors at that time, and the Commandant (校長) was Mr. Yi Hŭi-du (李熙斗), who passed away the year before last.

The Military Academy was closed (廢校) soon after the Russo-Japanese War (日露戰爭) broke out.<29>

**Summary**

This short article provides basic information about the Korean Military Academy established in 1899 during the Daehan Empire. It notes its location near Sŏdaemun Station in Seoul, initially on the former site of Salvation Army barracks and later encompassing a grand building on the former Monopoly Bureau residence site. It mentions foreign instructors and specifically names two Korean instructors, Ŏ Tam and Cho Sŏng-gŭn (both holding the rank of Lieutenant General in the Japanese Army at the time of writing, 1934), and the first Commandant, Yi Hŭi-du. The academy's closure shortly after the start of the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905) is also stated. From a historical perspective, the article is interesting as it casually mentions Koreans who achieved high rank (Lieutenant General) within the Japanese military structure during the colonial period (Ŏ Tam and Cho Sŏng-gŭn), reflecting the complex paths some Koreans navigated under Japanese rule. The academy's brief existence and closure tied to the Russo-Japanese War also highlight the turbulent geopolitical situation involving Korea, Japan, and Russia at the turn of the 20th century, leading up to annexation.
