秋日雜想
						岸曙

1
Cosmos have bloomed, in the late autumn.
Red ones, light pink, white and yellow flowers
Swaying lightly, excitedly, playing in the wind—
In the dark night, under the cold frost, they will be tearful.

2
Autumn wind, why do you blow so?
All my rusted memories will fly away.
My heart's garden, where flowers have fallen and leaves are dry,
If even that disappears, wouldn't I be lonely?

3
The insect cries, welcoming the full moon,
The stream sings because the night is good,
The wind embraces the leaves, dreaming this night,
Why is it that my heart cannot find sleep?

4
The red cosmos flowers, the blowing autumn wind—
Turning East, passing West, going North again,
Each and every melody is entirely different;
In this, I see the different tunes of humans.＜213＞

**Summary**

This four-stanza poem by Kisŏ (岸曙), published in November 1934, uses autumn imagery—cosmos flowers, wind, frost, the moon, insects, streams, and falling leaves—to evoke feelings of melancholy, nostalgia, and sleeplessness. The speaker reflects on fleeting beauty, fading memories, and the loneliness that might follow loss. The final stanza contrasts the varied "tunes" of the wind with the diverse paths or experiences of human lives. From a historical perspective, while primarily a lyrical expression of personal sentiment common in the era, the poem's themes of transience, loss, and the observation of different "tunes" or fates could subtly resonate with the uncertainties and diverse experiences of Koreans living under colonial rule, though it contains no overt political commentary. Historians might note its use of contemporary Korean vernacular and orthography, and its focus on nature and introspective feeling during a period of external constraint.

1
커스머스 피엿네, 늣즌가을에.
붉엉이에 연분홍 희고노랑꼿
행룽해룽 興이라 바람에노나
어둔밤 찬서리엔 눈물겨우리.

2
갈바람이 웨이닷 네가부느냐?
녹슬은 이내記憶 모다날으리.
꼿지고 닙이말은 나의맘동산
그나마 업서지면 아니외로랴.

3
버레는 보름달이 반가와울고
시내는 밤이죠와 노래를하고
바람은 닙을안고 꿈뀌는이밤,
무어라 이내맘은 잠못이루노.

4
커스머스 붉은꼿 부는갈바람
東을돌아 西지나 다시北가도
가락은 가락마다 모다다르이,
사람의 딴가락을 이에보노라.＜213＞
