Remembering the Hidden Faces of Sŏgyŏng's Genius Poets
						Kim Sŏngma (金城馬)

白毛浮綠水
紅掌踏淸波
(Lightly, white feathers float upon the green water, with red palms, they tread the clear waves (Author's poor translation)).
This poem was recited about 200 years ago by a poet named Chŏng Chisang (鄭知常) when he was three years old (自古神童於時禽未必達達者政不必了了耳獨鄭知常三歲口咏白鷗詩云... 古書 - Since ancient times, child prodigies among birds at that time may not necessarily have become accomplished, and the accomplished may not necessarily have been clear [as children], only Chŏng Chisang at age three orally recited a poem about a white gull, saying... Old Book).
Chŏng Chisang was, of course, a person from P'yŏngyang, and coincidentally, the house where the author currently lives is said by the elderly to be the site of Chŏng Chisang's house.
And there is a saying that he was the son of a Dragon. In any case, it seems to be a fact that he was a child prodigy (天才 - genius).
鄭知常外城橋口人古老相傳云雷雨之夕其母嫁橋口淵龍而有娠乃生生而能文三歲時見江上白鷗口語一絶云喧喧白鷗烏頭曲仰天歌白毛浮綠水紅掌踏淸波其神異若此龍孫之言不虛平壤大誌 (Chŏng Chisang was a person from Oesŏng Kyogu. According to ancient tradition passed down by the elderly, on a night of thunder and rain, his mother married the dragon of Kyoguyŏn (橋口淵) and became pregnant, thus giving birth to him. Born able to write, at the age of three, upon seeing a white gull on the river, he orally recited a quatrain saying, "Noisy, noisy white gull, black head bent, singing looking up at the sky. White feathers float on green water, red palms tread clear waves." His divine strangeness was like this; the saying of him being a Dragon's grandson is not false - P'yŏngyang Taeji).
Regarding the phrase "Oesŏng Kyogu person" (外城橋口人), the author wondered if it might be somewhere in the present Kyoguch'ŏng (橋口町) and doubted the words of the elderly, but learned that the house where the author lives was also called Kyogudong (橋口洞) in the old days, and it seems there must have been a pond called "Kyoguyŏn" (橋口淵) somewhere here.

庭前一葉落
床下百蟲悲
(Before the garden, a single leaf falls; Beneath the floor, a hundred insects grieve.)

聲摧山竹裂
血染野花紅
(The sound shatters, the mountain bamboo splits; Blood dyes the wild flowers red.)
Reading poems like these, can we not fully appreciate how deep a poetic sentiment Chŏng Chisang painted in nature? <105> Although poets have sung of nature since ancient times, I want to say that Chŏng Chisang, at any rate, was a great past poet that our Sŏgyŏng (西京 - P'yŏngyang) possessed, without the slightest detraction.

Namp'o (南浦)
雨歇長堤草色多 送君南浦動悲笳,
大洞江水何時盡 別淚年年添作波.
(The rain stops, the long embankment's grass color is abundant; Seeing you off at Namp'o, the sad pipes stir.
When will the water of the Taedong River (大洞江水) ever run dry? Parting tears, year after year, add to make waves.)

Sŏdo (西都)
紫陌東風細雨過 輕塵不動柳絲斜,
綠窓朱戶笙歌咽 盡是梨園弟子家.
(On the purple paths, the east wind and fine rain pass; Light dust does not move, willow threads hang slanted.
Green windows, red doors, the sheng and song pipes choke; All are homes of the disciples of the Pear Garden.)
We cannot know how old he was when he composed "Namp'o" (南浦) and "Sŏdo" (西都), but it must undoubtedly be from a time when his poetic thought had matured.

何人投綠筆
乙字寫江波
(Who threw the green brush? Writing the character '乙' (ŭl) on the river waves.)
This is said to be a verse composed by a person named Pyŏn Chiik (卞之益), a contemporary of Chŏng Chisang, facing an envoy from the Ming Dynasty when he was 7 years old.

月作都元帥 使風行號令
星爲百萬兵 一掃陳雲平
(The moon becomes the commander-in-chief, making the wind carry out orders;
The stars become a million soldiers, sweeping away the old clouds flat in one go.)
What a refreshing piece of writing this is! What a magnificent piece of writing this is! If a nine-year-old child composed this writing, we cannot help but be astonished once again. (Pak O (朴O)'s poem at nine years old says)

白紵白如雲 年年南浦別
靑娥手裡巾 拭淚送情人
(White ramie, white as clouds; Year after year, parting at Namp'o.
A handkerchief in the pretty girl's hand; Wipes tears seeing off her lover.)
Here, a love poem has appeared. How clean, yet affectionate, no, sorrowful and heart-rending a poem this is! Isn't it so much more beautiful than the ends of letters from today's stinking lechers? But listen to this. It is said to be a poem sent by a boy named Yi Sihang (李時恒), only twelve years old, to a certain Kisaeng (妓生). We cannot help but be utterly astonished.
The individuals listed above are worthy of being called child prodigies (神童). How much more splendid are they than the primary level things like 『아と來て遊べや親の*い雀』 (Ato kite asobeya oya no *i suzume - Come and play with me, parent-less sparrow)! In the Mainland (内地 - Japan), Issa (一茶) is called a genius poet! (child prodigy) - but we believe that just with the people listed above, we sufficiently surpass Issa (一茶). Thinking about it now, there are points that seem somewhat doubtful, but the author promises the various readers to seek more reliable documents and, accordingly, try to obtain even more interesting materials than these.
If we speak of Kye Wŏlhyang (桂月香), she is too famous a Kisaeng (妓生) to need further words, but looking at the poem she recited at the "Sipchangbuhoe" (十丈夫會 - Meeting of Ten Husbands/Scholars?), I believe she possessed a poetic talent that could surpass the men who shared the seats at that gathering. There may be those who say she couldn't, but I do not doubt that along with her magnanimous, unwomanly heart, her poetic talent was also outstanding. <106>

桂花待秋發素月上枝危林風休動樹零落不同時
(The Osmanthus flower awaits autumn to bloom, the white moon rises precariously on the branch; Forest wind, cease moving the trees, the scattering happens at different times. (The Osmanthus flower and white moon are self-metaphors; 'awaiting autumn' alludes to Pak Ok (朴億) whose sobriquet was Taech'uja (大秋子); the last two lines are a playful response to Im Kit'aek's (林起梀) poem)).
Now, looking at the poem by Pak Ok (朴億):
遠樹旌旄立羣山劒戟危千年江水滿不見退潮時
(Distant trees stand like banners and flags, clustered mountains are perilous like swords and halberds; For a thousand years the river water is full, one never sees the time of the receding tide. (The P'ae River (浿江) has three shallow rapids, above which is a deep pool ten ri long; the tide does not overflow, nor is it shallow at dusk)).
And Im Kit'aek's (林起梀) poem is:
關西十俊會江上一棲危金朴春情好高眠花發時
(The Ten Talents of Kwansŏ meet, perilously perched above the river; Kim (金) and Pak (朴)'s spring feelings are good, sleeping soundly when the flowers bloom.
(Mocking Chat'aek (自澤) and Ok (億) for consorting with courtesans)).
Kim Chat'aek's (金自澤) poem is:
江流撑水檻高坐不專危一樽燕趙士慷慨負明時
(The river flows supporting the waterside railing, sitting high is not solely perilous; One cask [of wine] with scholars of Yan and Zhao, passionately lamenting bearing a bright time. (Heroes meeting comrades, the passionate ones are these)).
Besides these, there are exquisite poems by the Ten Husbands (十丈夫) such as Chang Idŏk (張以德), Kim Kyŏngsŏ (金景瑞), Monk Pŏpkŭn (僧法根), Hyŏn Subaek (玄受白), Ko Ch'ungyŏng (高忠敬), etc., but I will omit them. However, writing down the poem of the Kisaeng (妓生) Ok Kye (玉介), who sat together with Kye Wŏlhyang (桂月香) at that time, it is as follows:
故家裁玉樹花發一枝危惟有黃金蝶蜜房自擇時
(An old family cultivates a jade tree, a flower blooms on one perilous branch; Only the golden butterfly chooses its own time for the honey chamber. (The first two lines are Ok Kye's (玉介) self-metaphor; the last two lines allude to Kim Chat'aek (金自澤)).

I will write down one amusing story here. There was a very handsome Prime Minister, who seems to have been remarkably steadfast regarding women.
No matter how much a beautiful woman wished to share his bed (同枕), he seems to have rarely permitted it.
One day, Kyehyang (桂香 - Kye Wŏlhyang) wished to share his bed with him, but the Prime Minister said he wouldn't go as far as sharing the bed, but would just hold her wrist and let go, so she should be satisfied. Kyehyang (桂香) had no choice but to say, "Then do so," and must have extended her wrist. When the Prime Minister told her to cover it with a sleeve cuff (汙衫 - hansam), Kyehyang (桂香) became greatly angered and composed the following poem, it is said.
無詩俠客圓靑瞽遠色男兒富貴僧.
(A knight-errant without poetry is a round blue blind man; a man distant from beauty is a wealthy monk.)
Thus she mocked and scolded him (嘲怒).
(時有一宰相其於女子腸如鐵石故妓無一薦枕桂香亦知莫可奈何所願止一執手宰相竟不忍拒乃曰然則以汙衫手於是桂香遂大憤激而作. ...平壤大誌 - At that time there was a prime minister whose disposition towards women was like iron and stone, thus no kisaeng had ever shared his pillow. Kyehyang (桂香) also knew it was impossible, so her wish stopped at just holding his hand. The prime minister finally couldn't bear to refuse and said, "If so, then use a sleeve cuff (汙衫) for the hand." At this, Kyehyang (桂香) became greatly enraged and composed this... P'yŏngyang Taeji).
And here is another story. There was a Kisaeng (妓生) named Ch'o Un (楚雲) whose face was unattractive, but instead, she was skilled at composing poetry, it is said.
One day, Ch'o Un (楚雲) saw Governor Pak Yŏp (朴燁) and wished to share his bed (同枕) once. Pak Yŏp (朴燁), being somewhat cruel in character, looked at Ch'o Un's (楚雲) face and became greatly angered. He had Ch'o Un (楚雲) dragged out and scolded her, saying, how dare you learn such talk? Ch'o Un (楚雲) replied, saying, "Other Kisaeng (妓生) have pretty faces, but I am not so, therefore I am not cherished by others. However, instead, I compose poetry better than any other Kisaeng (妓生) girl, which I recommend myself for. Therefore, in the end, don't I too have one strong point? That's why I dared to find the courage to ask Your Excellency (公) to share a bed (同枕)." <107> When she said this, Pak Yŏp (朴燁) calmed down a bit and said,
"Alright then, compose a verse."
At that, Ch'o Un (楚雲) said,
妾曾天上月中娘謫下人間第一娼若使姑蘇臺上立不敎西子醉吳王
(I was once the lady in the moon in heaven; Exiled down to the human world, the number one courtesan. If I were made to stand on the Kosu Terrace (姑蘇臺), I would not let Xishi (西子) intoxicate the King of Wu (吳王).)
so it is told.
(楚雲平壤名妓之一也非有姿色美談而然特以善詩有名於當世然自古男子擧皆取其美妙而鮮以詩才相交... 古書 - Ch'o Un (楚雲) was one of P'yŏngyang's famous kisaeng. It wasn't that she had beauty or charming conversation, but rather she was famous in her time specifically for being good at poetry. However, since ancient times, men have generally chosen the beautiful and lovely, and rarely associated [with them] based on poetic talent... Old Book).

상공(相公)을 뵈온 후 사사(事事)를 밋자오니. 졸직(拙直)한 마음에 병(病)들까 렴려러니. 이리마 저리차하니 백년동포(同胞)하리라.
(After meeting the Sangkong (相公 - general/elephant), I trust in the Sasa (事事 - advisor/guard). In my clumsy and straightforward heart, I worry about falling ill (病 - soldier/pawn). Going this way like a horse (馬) and that way like a chariot (車), let us be companions (同胞 - homophone for 同拘, captured together) for a hundred years.)
This Sijo (詩調) was composed instantly without hesitation by the Kisaeng (妓生) So Paekchu (小栢舟) about 300 years ago, when Governor Pak Yŏp (朴燁) sat at the Tonghŏn (東軒), ordered Changgi (將棋 - Korean chess) to be brought, placed the Changgi board before him, and told So Paekchu (小栢舟),
"Well now, you play Changgi and compose a verse or two."
This is the Sijo (詩調) she recited on the spot.
(「상공」 is indeed Sangkong (相公), referring to the "Sang" (象 - elephant) in Changgi; 「사사」 is Sasa (事事), the "Sa" (士 - guard); choljik (졸직) is "Chol" (卒 - pawn); 「병」 is "Pyŏng" (兵 - soldier); irima (이리마) is "Ma" (馬 - horse); chŏrich'a (저리차) is "Ch'a" (車 - chariot). Paeknyŏn tongp'o (백년동포) means Tonggu (同拘 - captured together). It's a Sijo (詩調) composed incorporating all "Sang (象), Sa (士), Chol (卒), Pyŏng (兵), Ma (馬), Ch'a (車), P'o (包 - cannon)" - truly an extraordinary talented Kisaeng (才妓)).

踈雨秋兼漏日飛回潮晩帶斜陽落
(Sparse rain, autumn doubles the leaks, the sun flies; The returning tide, late, carries the setting sun as it falls.)
This too is a verse composed by a P'yŏngyang Kisaeng (平壤妓生) named Un Hye (雲慧) before a high official.
(壬戍正月初一日淸朝侍班列於都城午門外班有西河者見我國使臣問曰貴國亦有善詩女流耶我使臣云非特貴女子爲然至於賤妓亦有可觀者肯願聞否平壤妓雲慧洗粉後見盆中水臙 指混合化軟紅色因以自吟者卽此也堤官大嘆服眞有驚人才)... ...古書.
(On the first day of the first month of the Im-sul year (壬戍 - 1742 or 1802?), during the Qing Dynasty (淸朝) court attendance, lined up outside the O Gate (午門) of the capital city, someone from Sŏha (西河) saw our country's envoy and asked, "Does your esteemed country also have female literary figures skilled in poetry?" Our envoy replied, "It is not only that noblewomen are so, even among the lowly kisaeng (賤妓), there are those worth seeing. Would you care to hear?" The P'yŏngyang kisaeng Un Hye (平壤妓雲慧), after washing off her powder, saw the rouge (臙脂) mixed in the basin water turning a soft red color, and composed this impromptu verse. The official [from Sŏha] greatly admired it, [saying] "Truly possesses astonishing talent"... Old Book).

With this, I will conclude this manuscript, but what we must pay attention to here is the fact that Kisaeng (妓生) were skilled in writing in those days.
Even if the author does not mention it here, everyone knows it, but truly among the Kisaeng (妓生) of that time, there were women of letters (文章) and not a few poets (詩人). As times change, the education (敎養) of Kisaeng (妓生) will naturally change as well, but if we were to bring up this kind of talk to the Kisaeng (妓生) of today, it would likely be something close to rudeness (無禦).
(In drafting this manuscript, I spare no gratitude for the instruction (下敎) of Mr. No In'gyu (盧麟奎).)

**Summary**

This article by Kim Sŏngma, published in 1934, reminisces about the literary talents of historical figures from P'yŏngyang (Sŏgyŏng), focusing particularly on child prodigies (神童) like the 3rd-century poet Chŏng Chisang and others such as Pyŏn Chiik and Pak O, as well as highly skilled Kisaeng (妓生) poets like Kye Wŏlhyang, Ch'o Un, So Paekchu, and Un Hye. The author quotes their poems (often originally in Classical Chinese) and recounts anecdotes illustrating their wit, talent, and sometimes challenging circumstances, contrasting their profound literary abilities with what the author perceives as the lesser talents of contemporary figures or even celebrated Japanese poets like Issa. The author expresses pride in P'yŏngyang's rich literary heritage and laments the perceived decline in the literary cultivation of contemporary Kisaeng.

From a colonial history perspective, the article is interesting for its assertion of Korean cultural and literary superiority, specifically mentioning P'yŏngyang figures surpassing the famed Japanese poet Issa. This subtle nationalistic pride, focusing on historical achievements, was a common way intellectuals navigated cultural identity under Japanese rule. The focus on *kisaeng* as bearers of high culture, contrasting them implicitly with contemporary ones and perhaps suggesting a decline under modernizing/colonial influence, could also be a point of interest for historians studying cultural change and gender roles during this period. The slightly incongruous 1943 date at the end, if not a typo, might warrant further investigation regarding the manuscript's history.

西京의 天才詩人, 감추어진 그들의 面貌를 追想함
						金城馬
白毛浮綠水
紅掌踏淸波
(가벼웁게도 힌 털은 푸른 물우에 뜨채, 붉은 손 쟝으로 맑은 물결을 밟어 나가는구나 (筆者拙譯).
이 詩는 지금으로붙어 約 2백年前人 사람 鄭知常이라는 詩人이 세살적에 읊은 詩외다(自古神童於時禽未必達達者政不必了了耳獨鄭知常三歲口咏白鷗詩云... 古書).
鄭知常은 無論 平壤사람이요 공교롭게도 筆者가 지금 살고 잇는 집이 卽 鄭知常이에 집ㅅ자리라고, 老人들이 말 함니다.
그러고 그는 龍의 아들이란 말이 있음니다. 左右間 神童(天才)이든 겄만은 事實이겠지요.
鄭知常外城橋口人古老相傳云雷雨之夕其母嫁橋口淵龍而有娠乃生生而能文三歲時見江上白鷗口語一絶云喧喧白鷗烏頭曲仰天歌白毛浮綠水紅掌踏淸波其神異若此龍孫之言不虛平壤大誌.
이 「外城橋口人」이라고 한데 對해서, 筆者는 或 現在 橋口町 어데가 안인가하고 老人들의 말을 疑訝했으나, 筆者의 사는 집도 옛날에는 橋口洞이든 겄을 알 수 있고 여긔 어듸 「橋口淵」이란 못이 있든가 봄니다.
庭前一葉落
床下百蟲悲

聲摧山竹裂
血染野花紅
이런 詩를 읽고, 우리는 鄭知常이가 自然에 얼마나＜105＞ 깊은 詩想을 그리고 있엇니지를 足히 알수 있지 안읍닛가? 원악 詩人들은 옛적부터 自然을 읊어왔지만 如何間 鄭知常만은 우리 西京이 가지고 있는 過去의 偉大한 詩人이엇음에 秋毫의 損될 바 없음을 말하고 싶음니다.
南浦
雨歇長堤草色多 送君南浦動悲笳,
大洞江水何時盡 別淚年年添作波.
西都
紫陌東風細雨過 輕塵不動柳絲斜,
綠窓朱戶笙歌咽 盡是梨園弟子家.
「南浦」와 「西都」는 그가 몃살에 지은 글인지는 알 수 없으나, 應當 詩想이 酣熟됏을 젹에 겄임은 틀님없을 겄이다.

何人投綠筆
乙字寫江波
이겄도 鄭知常과 같은 때 사람인 卞之益이란 사람이 7歲에 明나라 使臣을 對하야 지은 글이라고 함니다.
月作都元帥 使風行號令
星爲百萬兵 一掃陳雲平
이 얼마나 시원한 글 임닛가? 얼마나 壯快한 글 임닛가? 이 글을 아홉살 먹은 어린애가 지은 겄이라면 우리는 다시 한번 놀나지 않을 수 없음니다. (朴O九歲咏云)
白紵白如雲 年年南浦別
靑娥手裡巾 拭淚送情人
여긔에 戀愛詩가 나왔음니다. 얼마나 깨꿋하면서도 多情스러운, 아니, 恨스러운 애닲은 詩임닛가? 요즘 구린내 나는 好色男들의 편지끗테 그겄보담 얼마나 아름답슴닛가? 그런데 말임니다. 李時恒이란 열두살밖에 안먹은 少年이 어느 妓生한테 보낸 詩라고요. 우리는 그만 놀나지 않을 수 없음니다.
以上에 列擧한 이들은 말 神童이라고 할만한 이들임니다. 『아と來て遊べや親の*い雀』따위의 一次의 그겄보다 얼마나 훌륭함닛가? 內地서는 一茶를 天才詩人!(神童)-이라고 함니다만, 우리는 以上 列擧한 사람들만 가지고도 넉넉히 一茶를 凌駕한다고 봄니다. 지금 우러가 생각하기에 다소 疑向에 갓가운 点도 없지 않으나, 筆者는 좀더 確信할만한 文獻을 求하고 따라서, 이보담도 더 興味있는 材料를 얻어볼겄을 여러 讀者들에게 約束해 둠니다.
桂月香이라고하면, 너무나 有名한 妓生임으로 더 말하지 않고 그가 『十丈夫會』에서 읊은 詩를 보면, 그 座席에 자리를 가티한 남자들을 凌駕할만한 詩才를 가졋다고 나는 봄니다. 그러치 못하다는 이도 있겟지만, 그는 그 浩闊한 女子답지 않은 그 마음과 한가지로, 詩才도 亦是 卓越하였음을 나는 疑心치 않슴니다.＜106＞
桂花待秋發素月上枝危林風休動樹零落不同時(桂花素月自喩待秋喩朴億別號大秋子也下二句戱答林起梀之詩也).
인제 朴億이란 사람의 詩를 보면, 遠樹旌旄立羣山劒戟危千年江水滿不見退潮時(浿江有三灘之淺上有十里深潭潮不溢夕不淺).
그러고 林起梀의 詩는
關西十俊會江上一棲危金朴春情好高眠花發時
(譏自澤億之挾娼也).
金自澤의 詩는,
江流撑水檻高坐不專危一樽燕趙士慷慨負明時(英雄遇同志慷慨者此也)
이 外에도 張以德, 金景瑞, 僧法根, 玄受白,  高忠敬等 十丈夫의 絶唱이 있으나, 畧하거니와 當時 桂月香과 가틔 앉었든 妓生 玉介의 詩를 적으면 다음과 갔음니다.
故家裁玉樹花發一枝危惟有黃金蝶蜜房自擇時(上二句는 玉介自喩요, 下二句는 喩金自澤이라).

나는 여긔에 한개의 우수은 이야기를 적어 보겠음니다. 아주 美男子 宰相이 있엇는데, 女子에 대해서는 여간 굳지 않었든 모양임니다.
아모리 美人이 同枕하기를 願할지라도 그는 좀처럼 許하지 않든 모양임니다.
하로는 桂香이가 그에게, 同枕하기를 願한 즉, 그 宰相은 同枕까지는 않하겠으나, 손목이나 한번 쥐엇다 놀께니, 滿足하라닛간, 桂香도 할 수 없이, 구럼 그리라고 하며 손목을 내밀었겠지요. 宰相이 말하기를 거긔다가 汙衫(한삼)을 쩌우라닛간 桂香은 크게 성을 내며 다음과 가튼 詩를 지였다고요.
無詩俠客圓靑瞽遠色男兒富貴僧.
이라고 嘲怒했음니다.
(時有一宰相其於女子腸如鐵石故妓無一薦枕桂香亦知莫可奈何所願止一執手宰相竟不忍拒乃曰然則以汙衫手於是桂香遂大憤激而作. ...平壤大誌).
그리고 여긔에 또 한가지 이야기가 있음니다. 楚雲이라는 얼골이 못생긴 妓生이 있었는데, 그 대신 그는 詩를 잘 지었다고 함니다.
楚雲이 하로는, 監司 朴燁을 보고, 한번 同枕하기를 원한 즉, 朴燁은 爲人이 多少 殘暴하든지라, 楚雲의 얼골을 쳐다보고 크게 성을 내서 楚雲은 끄러내다노코 꾸지저 말하기를 었지 네가 敢히 그런 수작을 배았느냐고 하닛간, 楚雲은 對答하야 말하기를, 다른 妓生들은 얼골이 엡븜니다만, 저는 그렇지 못함으로 남한데 귀염을 못 받습니다. 그러나 저는 그 대신 다른 아모 妓生애들 보담 詩를 잘 짓는겄으로 自薦함니다. 그러닛간 結局 나도 한가지 장조는 있는 셈이 않임닛가? 그래서 제가 敢히 公보고 同枕하기를 請할 勇氣도 나갔든 겄임니다. 이러케＜107＞ 말하닛간, 朴燁도 좀 가라앉어
『그럼 한수 지어 보아라』
하닛간 楚雲이
妾曾天上月中娘謫下人間第一娼若使姑蘇臺上立不敎西子醉吳王
이라고 했담니다.
(楚雲平壤名妓之一也非有姿色美談而然特以善詩有名於當世然自古男子擧皆取其美妙而鮮以詩才相交... 古書).

상공(相公)을 뵈온 후 사사(事事)를 밋자오니. 졸직(拙直)한 마음에 병(病)들까 렴려러니. 이리마 저리차하니 백년동포(同胞)하리라.
이 詩調는 約 三百年前에 監司 朴燁이이란 이가 東軒에 앉어서, 將棋를 가지고 오라고하야 將棋를 앞에 놋고, 妓生 小栢舟보고
『어듸 너 將棋두고 글이나 한귀 지어라』
하닛가, 小栢舟는 서슴치않고 곳 읊은 詩調가 곳 이겄이다.
(「상공」은 즉 相公인데, 將棋의 「象」을 말함이요.
「사사」는 事事將棋의 「士」요, 졸직은 「卒」 「병」은 「兵」이리마는 「馬」 저리차는 「車」)데 백년동포는 同拘란 뜻이다.
「象士卒兵馬車包」를 다 엿코 지은 詩調니 實로 非凡한 才妓디」
踈雨秋兼漏日飛回潮晩帶斜陽落
이겄도 亦是 平壤妓生 雲慧라는 이가, 大官“¤ 앞에서 지은 글이다.
(壬戍正月初一日淸朝侍班列於都城午門外班有西河者見我國使臣問曰貴國亦有善詩女流耶我使臣云非特貴女子爲然至於賤妓亦有可觀者肯願聞否平壤妓雲慧洗粉後見盆中水臙 指混合化軟紅色因以自吟者卽此也堤官大嘆服眞有驚人才)... ...古書.

이겄으로써 本稿의 끗을 맥겠거니와 우리는 여긔서 注目해야 할 겄은 當時에는 妓生들이 글을 잘 했다는 事實임니다.
筆者가 여긔에 말하지 안트라도 다 아는 겄이지만 實로 當時에 妓生들 중에는 文章도 있었고, 詩人들도 젹지 않었읍니다. 時代變遷에 따라, 妓生들의 敎養도 自然히 變할 겄이지만, 우리가 요즘 妓生들을 對하야 이다위ㅅ 소리를 끄내면, 그겄은 無禦에 갓가운 즛일 겄임니다.
