Article Title: 社告 (Public Notice)

Article Type: 사고·편집후기 (Notice/Editorial Postscript)

**Public Notice**

Regarding the two articles published in the July and August issues of this magazine:
1. Ch'ŏndogyo at the Crossroads of Rise and Fall (興亡岐路에 선 天道敎)
2. To the Youth Masses of Ch'ŏndogyo (天道敎 靑年大衆에 與함)

Due to unavoidable circumstances (避치 못할 事情), there were many places where omissions were made in the middle (中畧) and later parts (下畧), and sections were omitted (省畧). Consequently, there is the implication (嫌) that the author's argument (立論) was not fully expressed (充分히 表現되지 못한). As it seems that person (該氏) is receiving various misunderstandings (種種의 誤解) from the public (世間), I hereby offer a brief clarification (一言으로 辨明하여 둠니다) out of my editorial responsibility (編輯 責任上).

**Summary**

This public notice from the editor of Samch'ŏlli magazine, Kim Tong-hwan, addresses reader concerns and potential misunderstandings regarding two articles on the religion Ch'ŏndogyo published in previous issues. The editor admits that significant portions of the articles were omitted ("中畧", "下畧", "省畧") due to "unavoidable circumstances," which prevented the author's arguments from being fully presented and led to public misinterpretations. The notice serves as a clarification issued out of editorial responsibility. For historians, this notice is revealing as it points directly to censorship or self-censorship ("unavoidable circumstances" leading to omissions) common in colonial Korea, especially when discussing potentially sensitive topics like religious organizations and their internal situations (here, Ch'ŏndogyo's "crossroads"). It highlights the constraints under which publishers operated and their attempts to manage public perception and protect authors.
