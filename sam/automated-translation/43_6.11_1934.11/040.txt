Article Type: 잡저 (Miscellaneous article/Essay)

Empress Myŏngsŏng passed away (도라가섯는데) on October 8, 1895, at Kyŏngbok Palace (景福宮), and one month later in November, a grand funeral ceremony (宏壯한 葬禮) was held (擧行되엇다). The tomb site (墓所) was near the present-day Government-General Forestry Station (總督府 林業所) in Ch'ŏngnyangni (淸凉里).

Ministers (公使) from various countries all participated (參加하여) in this funeral ceremony, making it grand (宏壯하엿는데), and it is said that the ministers from various countries also all slept (잣다고) for two nights each at the tomb site.

The funeral procession (葬列) was so long that even when the head (先頭) had already reached (到達하엿는데도) Tongdaemun Gate (東大門), the tail (꼬리) was reportedly still (아직) at Taehanmun Gate (大漢門).<25>

**Summary**

This article briefly describes the funeral of Empress Myeongseong (Queen Min). It states the funeral occurred in November 1895, one month after her assassination, near the Government-General Forestry Station in Cheongnyangni. It highlights the event's grandeur, noting the participation of foreign ministers (who supposedly stayed overnight at the tomb site) and the immense length of the funeral procession, stretching from Taehanmun Gate to Dongdaemun Gate. From a historical perspective, the article provides a colonial-era recollection of a significant event. Historians might find the explicit dating of the grand funeral to November 1895 interesting, as the large state funeral described is usually associated with November 1897; this could indicate a conflation of events or reference to an earlier rite. The mention of foreign dignitaries staying at the tomb and the specific location relative to a colonial institution (Forestry Station) are also noteworthy details reflecting the period's memory and context.
