Company Announcement
						Chief of the Confidential Room

For the November issue, the *Samch'ŏlli* Confidential Room (三千里 機密室) had prepared many secret matters and hidden histories (秘事機史), but unavoidably, we ended up omitting them (割愛). Starting from the December issue, we will once again cover various fields (多方面) comprehensively (網羅) and excitingly (精彩잇게), so please overlook it just for this month (눌너 보아 주시압).<20>

**Summary**

This brief notice from the "Chief of the Confidential Room" of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine informs readers that planned content featuring "secret matters and hidden histories" (秘事機史) for the November 1934 issue had to be cut. The magazine promises to resume publishing such content extensively from the December issue and asks for the readers' understanding. From a historical perspective, this notice is interesting as it hints at the type of potentially sensitive or intriguing content (*pisagisa* - secret/unofficial histories) the magazine aimed to publish during the colonial period. The abrupt cancellation suggests possible external pressures or self-censorship, reflecting the challenging publishing environment under Japanese rule.
