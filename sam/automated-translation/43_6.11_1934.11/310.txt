**Body Text Translation:**
Impressions of Tokyo Writers
						Chang Ch'unp'ung

Sugiyama Heisuke
Rather than calling this person a writer (作家), it would be more appropriate to call him a good critic (評論家). The first place I met him was the M University Memorial Auditorium (M大記念講堂). At that time, standing on the platform, his face was flushed red like a drunk person. I have forgotten what the lecture title (演題) was, but it is a fact that he droned on quite tediously. His voice was not very loud, and perhaps because I was sitting in the back row, I could not hear his words clearly. Some of you may have read this person's criticism (評論) (Was it the May issue of Bungei (文藝五月號)? I don't recall the specifics). It seems his essay on Naoki Sanjūgo (直木三十五論) received much favorable reception. Also, he publishes rare criticisms and the like without fail in the literary magazine called Maigetsu Bungei (每月文藝) (published by Kaizōsha (改造社出版)), so you likely know more about him than I do.

Kikuchi Kan
I eagerly read Kikuchi Kan's romance novels when I was 15 or 16, but now, four years later, I don't feel like reading them as fervently as I did back then, so I have stopped for now.
It is well known that this person is a master (大家) of the Japanese literary world (文壇), so <165> I believe there is no need to say more. It seems he is also famous among writers for having a lot of money. According to Ms. Hayashi Biyōko (林美蓉子氏), Kikuchi Kan receives 40 yen (四珨圓) per manuscript page. Some of you might impatiently ask what he does with all the manuscript fees from writing so many novels, but since I also have never directly asked him what he does with that money, how would I know? Perhaps he buys sweets (菓子) to eat with it?
Someone said he gambles on horse racing (競馬).
Then another person said, "Man, even when Kikuchi Kan gambles on horse racing, he always wins." Then, he probably wouldn't spend all the money he earns just buying sweets. Why do you need to know that, you frustrating person! Let's talk about money later. The Kikuchi Kan I saw was quite different from the complex impression I got from his previous novels. Like others had told me, his appearance (外模) was not that bad, and I rather took a liking (好感) to his voice, which I had imagined would be thin like a young boy's (少年). It was quite different from what I had expected, thinking he would have aged (老衰) somewhat. The person I saw looked no older than about thirty. He cannot properly keep his eyes still.
He blinks tens of times even in one minute (一分間), which was a bit uncomfortable to watch from the side. In the past, I liked *Madam Pearl* (眞球夫人). I went into the library (圖書館) in the morning and read it all by night before coming out. According to Mr. Kiku(池)chi, he himself was in love when he was young. And from that time, he enjoyed literature (文學) and thought perhaps he would write romance novels in the future. Is there any novel, by any author, that does not include a scene <146> of love between men and women (男女戀愛)? But the reason his novels have a stronger, more unique technique (手法) of romance than others might be somewhat related to this experience!
It is said that Mr. Kikuchi also suffered (고상) quite a bit during his youth (靑春時節). However, the novels he writes now are not based entirely on the suffering of his past experiences, but depict the luxurious (好華) lives of the propertied class (有産階級) and their whispered love, which is even more suspicious than the "buying sweets" explanation.
As I came out, I muttered to myself, "If only his height were a bit taller." At that moment, his shadow walked down the main street of some temple.

Toyoshima Yoshio
If you look at the magazine Kaizō (改造), you will occasionally see this person's novels. Like his novel passages are strangely peculiar (닌걱과 갓치 - likely '민것과 같이' meaning 'plainly' or 'strangely'), his height is quite tall (김니다). Even on the platform (壇上), he cannot hold his body straight, and his upper body (半身) bends forward, not backward, like a woman's (여사).
His voice is neither loud nor soft, but he cries (울음니다) quite well. He himself says, "I cry more than others." When I first saw him, he somehow looked that way too (continued above).

Okada Teiko
Among female writers (女流文人), this person seems particularly energetic (精力家). And the impression (印象) she left on me first was that she was a very composed (沈靜) person. When I met her at some gathering place (集合所), it happened to be her turn, and when she spoke about literature (文學) from one spot for about an hour, her fluent speech (流暢한 言辭) and tense attitude (緊張된 態度) seemed very reliable. Her abundant knowledge (豊富한 識見) was endless (끗이 업서), making me feel rather burdened (북하게까지) sitting there any longer.
Through her glasses (眼鏡), her eyes clearly told me of her intelligence (聰明).
Overall, she was the type of person who remains in one's impression.
As I returned home, I muttered to myself, "Why didn't she become a female doctor (女醫師)..." <147>
<145-147>

**Summary**

This article by Chang Ch'unp'ung, a Korean author, provides personal impressions of four prominent Japanese literary figures encountered in Tokyo: the critic Sugiyama Heisuke, the famous novelist Kikuchi Kan, the novelist Toyoshima Yoshio, and the female writer Okada Teiko. The author describes their appearances, mannerisms, speaking styles, and briefly touches upon their works or reputations (Kikuchi Kan's wealth and popular novels, Sugiyama's critiques, Toyoshima's writing in *Kaizō*, Okada's intelligence and energy). The tone is observational, sometimes slightly critical or bemused, reflecting the author's personal encounters and preconceptions versus reality. Historically, the article is interesting as it shows a Korean intellectual engaging with and observing the contemporary Japanese literary scene during the colonial period. It provides a snapshot of how these Japanese figures were perceived by a Korean observer, including rumors and personal judgments, offering a glimpse into cultural interactions and perceptions across the colonial divide within the shared space of East Asian literature.

東京文人 印象記
						張春豊
衫山平助
이분을 作家라느니 보다도 조흔 評論家라면 그가 適當한 말 일것이다. 처음 만난 곳이 M大記念講堂이 엇다. 그때 壇에 선, 이분은 술취한 사람갓치 얼골이 불것젓다. 演題가 무엇이든지는 이저버렷스나, 퍽이나 지리하게 떠든 것은 事實이다. 그리 音聲이 크지안코, 내가 後列에 안젓든 關係로인지 明確한 말소리를 드를수 업섯다. 혹 어느 분 중에는 이 분에 評論을 닑그젓든 이도 잇슬걱이어니와 (文藝五月號)이엇든가 仔細한 記憶이 업다. 直木三十五論을 써 만흔 호평을 바든 듯하다. 그리고 每月文藝이란(改造社出版) 文藝雜誌에 빠지지 안코, 稀有한 評論 등을 發表하고 잇스니 여러운 나 以上으로 더 잘 아시는 것이 잇슬 걱이다.

菊池寬
菊池寬에 연애小說을 나는 15,6時節에 熱心으로 닑고, 그후 四年이 지난 지금은 그 당시와 갓치, 熱烈히 닑고 십흔 기분이 나질 안허, 지금은 中止하고 잇다.
이분이 일번文壇에 大家인 것은, 다 아는 바이니＜165＞ 다시 더 말할 必要가 업슬 줄 안다. 文人中 돈만키로도, 有名한가 보이다. 林美蓉子氏의 말이라, 菊池寬은 原稿一枚에 四珨圓이라니 그러케 만흔 소설을 써 그 原稿料를 다 무엇하느냐고, 여러분중에선, 성화가치 무르실 분이 잇을 것이나, 나 亦是 아즉까지 씨에게 直接 그 돈을 무엇하느냐고 무러본 일이 업스니 엇지 알수 잇겟슴니가만, 그 돈으로 菓子틀 사 먹지나 안흘가요.
엇던 사람말이 競馬를 한다는데,
또 엇던 분은 이 사람아 菊池寬이는 競馬를 해도, 日常 이긴다데 그러면, 그만히 버는 돈을 다 菓子만 사 머글러니는 업슬텐데 그건 아러 무얼해 이 답답한 사람아! 돈 이야기는 나종에 하고, 내가 본 菊池寬은, 이전 그의 小說에서 어든, 複雜한 印象과는 아조 差가 잇섯다. 남에게 드른말과 갓치 外模가 그나지 못나지도 안코, 가늘고 어린 少年과 갓치 생각한 그 音聲은 나는 도리혀 好感을 가젓다. 얼마쯤 老衰하엿스리라고, 豫想하엿든과는 퍽으나, 달럿다. 내가 본 그는 不過 三十가령밧게 안 보헛다. 그는, 눈을 제대로 잡시를 가지고 잇지 못한다.
一分間에도, 멧십번을 감엇다 떳다, 하는 겻헤서 보기에 좀 거북하엿다. 지나간 날 나는, 眞球夫人을 조와하엿섯다. 그것을 圖書館에서 아참에 드러가. 밤까지 다 닑거 버리고 나왓섯다. 池씨에 하는 말에 의하면 어려서 자기는 사랑을 햇다고 한다. 그리고 그때부터 文學을 즐기여 장차 戀愛小說이라도 쓸가 하엿다고. 엇던 소설 누구의 소설에는은 男女戀愛＜146＞ 場面이 드지안흔 것이 잇으리요만 그에 소설이 더욱 남보다 獨特한 戀愛手法이 强함은 이러한 理由도 얼마간 잇섯든 關係가 아닌가!
靑春時節에 氏는, 고상도 퍽 햇섯다고 한다. 그러면 지금 쓰는 소설은 전연 자기의 經驗에서 나온 과거의 괴러움을 背景으로 한 걱이 아니라 好華한, 有産階級들의, 생활과, 그들의 속사기는 사랑만을, 쓰고 잇스니, 이는 「菓子 사 먹는」 그것보다도, 더 疑心이다.
나는 나오면서, 그에 키가 좀 컷드라면하고 혼자말하여 보앗다. 그때 그의 그림자가, 어느 절에 큰길을 거러갓다.

豊島與志雄
雜誌 改造를 보시면 이분에 小說이 間或 눈에 띠울 것이외다. 그에 小說구절이, 별나게 닌걱과 갓치 키가 퍽으나 김니다. 壇上에서도 몸을 바로 가지지 못하고, 半身은 後面으로가 아니라, 압흐로 向하여 구부러지기가, 여사인 것 갓다.
音聲은 크도 적도, 안흐나 퍽으나 잘 울음니다. 자기말이 나는 남보다 더 만히 운다고 처음 내가 보기에도, 엇전지 그래 보엿섯다(상단으로 게속).

岡田楨子
女流文人中에도, 이분은 특히 精力家인 듯하외다. 그리고, 나에 첫 印象에 비친 氏는 퍽으나 沈靜한 분이엇다. 엇던 集合所에서 이분을 만낫슬 때 마잠 이분에 차레가 되어 文學에 대하여 約 한시간동안이나, 한자리에서 말하게 되엇슬 때 그 流暢한 言辭와 緊張된 態度에 퍽 미듬직하여 보혓섯다. 豊富한 識見은 끗이 업서, 오히려 나 자신이 더 안젓기가 북하게까지 되어젓섯다.
眼鏡속에서 그 눈은 자기의 聰明함을 여실히 나이게 말하엿다.
大體로 그분은 印象에 남은 그런 型이엇다.
나는 집으로 도라오며 엇재 女醫師가 되지 안코... 혼자 중얼거려 보앗다.＜147＞
