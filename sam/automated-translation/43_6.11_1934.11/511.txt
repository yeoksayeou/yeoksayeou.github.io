Apology and Gratitude

○ Hitherto, this magazine has been published on the first day of each month. However, due to the mailing dates, it ultimately reaches the hands of our readers in the provinces many days later. As there have been many requests for an improvement in the publication date, starting from this November issue, we have decided to make it a principle to publish in advance on the 15th of the preceding month and implement it accordingly. For this reason (그러기닭에), the October issue was unavoidably suspended. In its place, the December issue will also be published on November 15th, and the New Year issue on December 15th. We will certainly publish each month without fail, so please continue to read our magazine with even more affection.

○ For the New Year issue, we are currently mobilizing the entire editorial department and bustling about, intending to pour in the full capabilities accumulated during our company's eight years since its founding to create a truly grand spectacle. Please look forward to it greatly.<280>

**Summary**

This editorial note announces a change in the publication schedule for the magazine *Samch'ŏlli*. To ensure timelier delivery to readers outside the capital, especially in the provinces, the magazine will now be released on the 15th of the preceding month instead of the 1st of the current month. This change necessitated skipping the October 1934 issue, for which the editors apologize. They assure readers of consistent future publication and promote the upcoming special New Year issue, marking the magazine's 8th anniversary. From a historical perspective, this notice highlights the logistical challenges of print distribution in colonial Korea, particularly reaching provincial readers, and underscores the magazine's effort to maintain reader engagement and loyalty despite these hurdles. The mention of the 8th anniversary also points to the magazine's relative longevity and established presence by 1934.
