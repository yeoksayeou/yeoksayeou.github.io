Observation and Decision
						Kim Tonghwan (金東煥)

Through this magazine's "Samch'ŏlli Plenary Meeting (三千里全體會議)," private conversations, and also through the news conveyed by others, I have been able to deduce the following regarding the attitudes towards the Korean problem held by prominent figures currently emerging.

Song Chinu (宋鎭禹) stated that as a fundamental and preparatory movement for political action, the immediate urgent task is to first foster things like the nation's cultural improvement and a consumer cooperative movement. Hŏ Hŏn (許憲) seemed mindful of developing a feasible movement after seeing the conclusion of the Manchurian problem. Yu Chinhŭi (兪鎭熙) expressed his intention to reject all natural, partial movements. Yi Kwangsu (李光洙) spoke of lowering the standard and embarking on movements below the comma—that is, not political movements but cultural improvement, nurturing talent, and unity training projects. Kim Yaksu (金若水) mentioned the necessity of handling pressing issues when the time comes. An Chaehong (安在鴻) advocated for the immediate re-formation of a national organization, his words showing boldness and frankness. Besides these, although there was no opportunity to hear the arguments of Ch'oe Rin (崔麟) of Ch'ŏndogyo (天道敎), Hong Myŏnghŭi (洪命憙) of the former Sin'ganhoe (新幹會), Yun Ch'iho (尹致昊) and Sin Hŭngu (申興雨) of Christianity (基督敎), Han Yongun (韓龍雲) of Buddhism (佛敎), Chŏng Unyŏng (鄭雲永) of the Labor Federation (勞總), and others, it can anyway be seen from the above that there are two lines of argument for breaking through the current stagnant situation, which lacks any wind. One is the gradualist view (猶豫論者), arguing for first undertaking cultural improvement and the strengthening of economic power; the other is the immediate action view (卽行論者), a layer thinking even as far as concrete political platform issues through the re-formation of a central organization.

However, according to recent reports, the Police Affairs Bureau of the Government-General (總督府警務當局) has expressed its intention to severely crack down on left-wing activities and underground movements from now on by increasing the number of thought police (思想警官) by 500 with a budget of 500,000 won. If this happens, while the left-wing movement will [presumably suffer]—at the same time, one can only assume that the right-wing, gradualist legal movement (漸進的合法運動) will also concretely emerge and develop. This is something often seen both in the principles of movements and in the actual historical facts of various movements in other lands (外地).

Therefore, I believe that in the future, a gradualist, legal movement organization will be re-formed in our society by the hands of intellectuals, and it will absorb not only the middle class and wealthy farmer layer entirely but also accompany a portion of the proletariat, allowing it to grow for some time. What stage it will tread upon again after growing is something that need not be discussed in advance here, so I avoid mentioning it. However, in any case, it will be a gain that gray organizations and individuals, neither right nor left, will inevitably be pushed out from within their protective coloration. (Omitted)

We fervently hope that knowledgeable people (識者) at this time abandon the attitude of wandering only in the realm of observation (觀望) and calculation (打算), and after gaining a clear view of the times, show decisive, sound action and resolution (決意).<1>

**Summary**

The article discusses the differing opinions among prominent Korean figures in 1932 regarding the path forward for the nation under Japanese rule. Some advocate for gradual preparation through cultural and economic development (Song Chinu, Yi Kwangsu), while others call for more immediate political action and the re-formation of a central national organization (An Chaehong). The author notes the impending crackdown by the Japanese Government-General on left-wing and underground activities, predicting this will ironically foster the growth of a more moderate, legalistic right-wing movement. He concludes by urging intellectuals to abandon indecisive observation and take determined action based on a clear understanding of the situation. Historians might find this article interesting for its snapshot of the strategic debates within the Korean nationalist movement, the explicit mention of specific leaders' differing views (gradualism vs. immediate action), and the anticipation of increased Japanese surveillance ("thought police") impacting the trajectory of both left-wing and right-wing activism.

觀望과 決意
						金東煥
余는 本誌의 「三千里全體會議」와 私席의 談話와  傳하는이의 消息을 通하야 現在頭角을 나타내고잇는 嫂氏의 朝鮮問題에 對한 態度를 如左히 推知할수잇섯다.
宋鎭禹氏는 政治運動의 基本運動이요 準備運動으로써 爲先民族의 文化向上과 消費組合運動가튼 것을 이르킬 것을 當爲의 急務라하엿고 許憲氏는 滿洲問題의 歸結을보아 可爲할 運動의 展開에 留意하는 듯 하엿고 兪鎭熙氏는 自然的部分的運動을 一切排拒할을 表示하엿고 李光洙氏는 水準을 나추어 콤마 以下의 運動卽政治運動이 아닌 文化向上과 人才養成가 團結訓練事業에 着手할 것을 말하엿고 金若水氏는 에잇서선 當面問題의 取扱도 必要함을 말하엿고 安在鴻氏는 卽時 民族團體의 再結成을 主張하야 그 語義가 大擔하고 率直함을 보인다 이밧게 天道敎의 崔麟, 前新幹會의 洪命憙, 基督敎의 尹致昊, 新興雨, 佛敎의 韓龍雲, 勞總의 鄭雲永等 其他諸氏의 主張을 들을 機會업섯거니와 아무튼 以上에서 無風的인 現下의 沈滯된 局面의 打開하기 爲하야 두가지 論調가 잇슴을 알수잇겟다 하나는 猶豫論者로 文化向上와 經濟力의 充實에 先着手할 것을 主張하엿고 다른하나는 卽行論者로 中心團體의 再結成을 通하야 具體的政網問題지 생각하고잇는 層그것이엿다.
그런데 最近 들리는말에 總督府警務當局은 五十萬圓豫算으로 五百의 思想警官을 增員하야 今後부터 左翼取締와 地下運動을 峻烈하게 彈壓할을 表明하엿다. 이리되면 左翼運動이---하는 同時에 右翼인 漸進的合法運動도 具體的으로 拾頭展開될것만 想定할수잇다 이것은 運動의 圓則으로나 外地의 諸運動의 實際史實가운데서 往往히보아오든 바이다.
그럼으로 余는생각건대 今後 우리 社會에는 漸進的인 合法運動團體가 인테리손으로 再結成되여 그가 中産階級과 豪農層을 모조리 吸入함은 勿論, 無産階級의 一部지 同伴하야 얼마동안 成長할수잇슬 것이다. 그가 成長하다가 어한 段階를 다시 밟으리라는 것은 여기에 미리말할 必要엄는 일이기에 言及을 避하거니와 엇재 이리하야 右도아니오 左도아니든 灰色的團體와 個人들이 그 保護色속에서 不可避的으로 推出하지아니 할수엄슬것만은 所得이되리라.(略)
吾人은 識者가 이에 觀望, 打算의 域에서만 彷徨하든 態度를 버리고 時世를 達觀한뒤 斷然 健全한 動作과 決意가 잇서지기를 切切히 바라노라.＜1＞
