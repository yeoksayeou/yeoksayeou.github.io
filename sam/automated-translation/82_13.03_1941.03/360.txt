Playwrights' Association Formed

Among the members of the Theater Association, only the playwrights have separately organized a Playwrights' Association (劇作家同好會). Under the auspices of the Theater Association and in immediate response to the new order (신체제), it has been decided that they will provide bright and wholesome (明朗健全) works to each theater troupe. The officers and members (first enrollment) are listed below. It has been decided that works by individuals other than members of the Playwrights' Association, even if they are members of the Theater Association, will absolutely not be performed by the nine affiliated theater troupes without the consent of the Theater Association.

Playwrights' Association President: Yu Ch'ijin
Secretaries: Im Sŏn'gyu, Hong Kaemyŏng
Members (No Order): Kim Yŏngsu
Pak Yŏngho Yi Sŏhyang
Ham Sedŏk
Yi Ik Yi Unbang Yi Sŏgu Ch'oe Sangdŏk Pak Sinmin
Kim Sŭnggu Pak Chin Kim Kŏn<184>

**Summary**

This news brief reports the formation of the Playwrights' Association (劇作家同好會) in March 1941, operating under the umbrella of the established Theater Association (연극협회). The association, led by Yu Ch'ijin, aims to supply theater troupes with plays deemed "bright and wholesome" and aligned with the "new order" (신체제). Significantly, the article states that the nine theater troupes affiliated with the Theater Association are prohibited from staging works by playwrights outside this newly formed group without the association's approval. From a historical perspective, this event clearly illustrates the tightening control over cultural production, specifically theater, during the late colonial period in Korea. The emphasis on "bright and wholesome" works responding to the "new order" reflects the pressure to create art supporting Japanese wartime ideology and assimilation policies, while the restriction on non-member plays demonstrates the consolidation of approved artistic voices and the marginalization of others.
