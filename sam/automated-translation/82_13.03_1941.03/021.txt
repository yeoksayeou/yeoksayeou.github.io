**Summary**

This article, published in the Korean magazine *Samch'ŏlli* in March 1941, is a Japanese military report detailing claimed successes against Chinese forces during the Second Sino-Japanese War (referred to as the "China Incident"). It lists numerous operations conducted between late 1939 and late 1940, providing statistics on enemy forces engaged, enemy casualties (over 589,000 killed in 1940 alone, and a claimed total of over 1.8 million since 1937, estimated at 3.5 million including unconfirmed losses), prisoners taken, and vast quantities of captured equipment. In stark contrast, it reports relatively low Japanese casualties (around 13,000 killed in 1940, and roughly 102,000 since 1937, including major border clashes with the Soviets). The piece functions as wartime propaganda, emphasizing Japanese military dominance and the scale of enemy losses while minimizing Japanese sacrifices. For historians, this article is significant as it demonstrates the dissemination of Japanese imperial propaganda within colonial Korea, showcasing the official narrative of the war effort presented to the Korean populace. The vastly inflated enemy casualty figures compared to reported Japanese losses are typical of such propaganda and highlight the attempt to justify the war and maintain morale.
