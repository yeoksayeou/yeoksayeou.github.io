Editor's Postscript

Beginning with the "One-Day Labor Record" detailing the service rendered by the Sacred Mattock Brigade (聖鍬部隊), comprised of prominent figures from the Kyŏngsŏng (京城) financial world, dispatched to the Kanpeitaisha Puyŏ Shrine (官幣大社 扶餘神宮), currently under imperial construction (御造營) as a sanctuary embodying the spirit of Naeseon Ilch'e (內鮮一體 - Japan and Korea as One Body), the inclusion of special articles by Korean professors from various universities is something this journal takes pride in this month. Furthermore, we believe that Ch'oe Nam-sŏn's special contribution, "Eastern Ancient Peoples and the Purham Theory (東方古代民族과 不咸論)," alone represents a most precious harvest for Korea's (朝鮮) reading circles this month, and we urge you to read it thoroughly.

Moreover, we are confident that compiling the "Special Feature on Theater Culture (演劇文化特輯)" to commemorate the recent formation of the Korean Theater Association (朝鮮演劇協會) is a grand undertaking for the launch of a new Korean theater culture. In the next issue, we plan to publish a "Special Feature on Film Culture (映畵文化特輯)" and also special features on "Music and Art (音樂, 美術)."

The Culture Department (文化部) has recently been established within the National Total Mobilization Korean League (國民總力朝鮮聯盟). The "Written Advice to the Culture Minister/Director (文化部長에 進言狀)," penned by Messrs. Paek Ch'ŏl, An Sŏk-yŏng, and Yi Hŏn-gu, representing the literary, film, and theater circles respectively, for the development of Korean culture, will surely be of great help for the growth of Korean culture. We also believe that the "Report on Visiting Three Stars of Tokyo (東京三花形訪問記)" by our Tokyo Correspondent, Ch'oe Chŏng-sun, will be one of the enjoyable reads.

In literature and arts as well, dividing Korea (朝鮮) into Western (西方), Southern (南方), and Northern (北方) regions and, as the first part, compiling the "Special Feature on Western Province Regional Poetry (西道鄕土詩特輯)" is a particularly distinctive feature this month. In criticism, the "Contemporary Thoughts on Literature and Arts (文藝時感)" by Im Hwa and Han Sŏr-ya, along with Kim Tong-in's powerful work "Ilssu (일쑤)" and Ch'oe Chŏng-hŭi's "Ch'ŏnmaek (天脈)," are confidently presented as fine harvests for our literary circles.<300>

**Summary**

This editor's postscript for the March 1941 issue of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine highlights its key contents. It proudly mentions articles supporting the colonial agenda, such as the report on elite Koreans volunteering at the Buyeo Shrine (a symbol of "Naeseon Ilch'e" or Japan-Korea unification) and a contribution by Ch'oe Nam-sŏn. It also promotes special features on Korean theater culture (celebrating the newly formed Korean Theater Association), plans future features on film, music, and art, and notes a piece offering advice to the new Culture Department of the National Total Mobilization Korean League. Literary contributions include regional poetry and works by prominent writers like Kim Tong-in and Ch'oe Chŏng-hŭi. For historians, this postscript is revealing as it showcases the magazine's role in disseminating colonial ideology (Buyeo Shrine, Naeseon Ilch'e), organizing cultural activities under state-sponsored bodies (Korean Theater Association, National Total Mobilization League), and promoting specific cultural figures and literary trends during a period of intensified wartime mobilization and cultural control in Korea. The juxtaposition of promoting "Korean culture" while framing it within the colonial structure and featuring figures known for collaboration offers insight into the complexities of cultural production under occupation.

編輯後記
內鮮一體의 精神의 殿堂으로 지금 御造營 中인 官幣大社 扶餘神宮에 京城財界의 巨頭를 網羅한 聖鍬部隊가 출동하여 봉사한 그 一日勤勞記를 비롯하여, 各大學朝鮮人敎授의 特別論文을 揭載케 된 것은 이 달 本誌의 자랑으로 삼는 바이오며, 特別히 寄稿해 주신 崔南善씨의 「東方古代民族과 不咸論」만으로도 이 달 朝鮮讀書界의 至貴한 收穫일 줄 아옵고 熟讀을 바라는 바입니다.

더욱이, 今番 새로 誕生된 「朝鮮演劇協會結成」을 기념하여 「演劇文化」特輯을 꾸민 것은 새로운 朝鮮演劇文化의 發足을 위해 壯擧라 자신하며, 다음 호에는 「映畵文化」特輯과 또 「音樂, 美術」특집을 발간하려 하나이다.

이번 國民總力朝鮮聯盟에 文化部가 신설되었는데, 朝鮮文化의 발전을 위해, 문단과 映畵계와 연극계를 대표하여 白鐵, 安夕影, 李軒求 諸氏가 執筆한 「文化部長에 進言狀」은 朝鮮文化의 성장을 위해 큰 도음이 될 것이오며, 東京特派 崔貞順 氏의 「東京三花形訪問記」도 好讀物의 하나일 줄 믿나이다.

文藝에 있어서도, 朝鮮을 西方, 南方, 北方으로 3分하여 그 제1차로 「西道鄕土詩」 特輯을 꾸민 것도 이 달 異彩 中의 異彩오며, 評論으로 林和, 韓雪野 씨의 「文藝時感」과, 金東仁 씨의 力作 「일쑤」, 崔貞熙 씨의 「天脈」도 우리문단의 조흔 收穫이라 자신하나이다.<300>
