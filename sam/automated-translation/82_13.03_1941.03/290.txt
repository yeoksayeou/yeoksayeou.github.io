**Art Garden Movements, Special Feature Commemorating the Formation of the Chosŏn Theatre Association: "Theatre and the New Structure"**

Sŏ Hang-sŏk (徐恒錫氏) (Theatre Critic)
Mr. Sŏ, who has greatly contributed to the New Theatre Movement, recently managed the Chosŏn Yehŭngsa (朝鮮藝興社) and produced "The Ethics of a Wife" (안해의 倫理). These days, he is said to be concentrating his efforts on producing cultural films.

Song Yŏng (宋影氏) (Playwright)
Mr. Song, acclaimed as a conscientious playwright in the Chosŏn theatre world, is said to be busy writing a masterpiece at his home outside the city gate, having received a manuscript request from a certain theatre company.

Hong Hae-sŏng (洪海星氏) (Director)
Mr. Hong, who previously studied dramatic arts for many years at the Tsukiji Little Theater (築地小劇場), is said to be distinguishing himself as a director at the Tongyang Theater (東洋劇場) and is gaining much trust among the actors.

Pak Song (朴松氏) (Playwright)
Mr. Pak, who for a time drew the attention of literary figures by adapting Yi Ki-yŏng's (李箕永) original work <163> "New Land" (新開地), a super special production of Hanyang Film Company (漢陽映畵社), is planning to publish a collection of plays recently, which is expected to be released soon.

Yi Un-bang (李雲芳氏) (Playwright)
Mr. Yi, who has a long history as an exclusive writer for the Tong Kŭk (東劇 - likely Tongyang Theater), recently lost his beloved wife and is said to be living as a single man, suffering headaches from the visits of matchmakers.

Na Ung (羅雄氏) (Director)
Mr. Na, who, as the director for the theatre troupe Kohyŏp (高協), showed a realistic technique by directing "Sardines" (정어리), reportedly got married some time ago and recently dreamed of having a child of the second generation (제2세 국민 - i.e., a son).

Pak Chin (朴珍氏) (Director)
Mr. Pak, who for a while worked diligently at the forefront as a member of the preparatory committee for the founding of the "Theatre Association" (演劇協會), is reportedly quite anxious, worrying that the recently formed Theatre Association itself might not become an authoritative <164> body of grand unity truly dedicated to the construction of Chosŏn theatre and serving as one wing of the national culture movement, but might instead degenerate into a friendship group for some profit-oriented theatre proprietors.

Yi Sŏ-gu (李瑞求氏) (Playwright)
Mr. Yi, who at one time wrote lyrics for records and scripts for entertainment productions while working in the entertainment department of the broadcasting station, was recently appointed chairman of the Chosŏn Theatre Association (朝鮮演劇協會). Consequently, he has promised to exert himself further and write famous scripts for various theatre companies. However, after providing the titles (藝題) and telling them to announce them, it is said that due to being busy with various matters, he hasn't produced the scripts even after one or two months, causing quite a commotion among the theatre companies.

Yu Ch'i-jin (柳致眞氏) (Playwright)
Mr. Yu, who gained fame as a playwright of local color by writing about the scenery of a village with willow trees, is reportedly drawing public attention by stating his opinion in a certain new spring magazine, while writing about the future project items of the Theatre Association, proposing the establishment of a supervision department to audit the works of playwrights for the qualitative improvement of theatre. <165>

**Summary**

This article provides updates on the activities of prominent figures in the Korean theatre world in early 1941. It covers playwrights like Song Yŏng, Pak Song, Yi Un-bang, Yi Sŏ-gu, and Yu Ch'i-jin, and directors/critics Sŏ Hang-sŏk, Hong Hae-sŏng, Na Ung, and Pak Chin, detailing their current projects, personal lives, and involvement with the newly formed Chosŏn Theatre Association. The formation and nature of the Chosŏn Theatre Association, explicitly linked to the colonial government's "New Structure" (新體制) policy, are central themes, with concerns raised about its potential effectiveness and focus versus being merely a tool for control or profit. For historians, the article offers insights into the cultural landscape under late colonial rule, the pressures and opportunities faced by artists, and the specific context surrounding the establishment of the government-sponsored Chosŏn Theatre Association, reflecting attempts to co-opt and control cultural production. Pak Chin's anxieties and Yi Sŏ-gu's appointment and subsequent delays highlight the complexities and potential conflicts within the association's early days.
