Correction

We humbly make the following corrections to Mr. Chŏng Kyo-wŏn's (鄭僑源) "The Ethical Conclusion of Naeseon Ilch'e" (內鮮一體의 윤리적 歸結) published in the New Year issue of this magazine:
In item 75, change 救授 (kusŏ) and 授護 (suho) to 救援 (kuwŏn - rescue) and 援護 (wŏnho - aid/support); change 薨去 (honggŏ - demise) to 御薨去 (O-honggŏ - honorable demise [imperial connotation]); change 南鮮人間 (Namsŏn in'gan - Southern Korean people) to 內鮮人間 (Naesŏn in'gan - Japanese and Korean people); change "When I heard that [someone] was said to have been deeply grieved (御悲痛해 하시옵셨다고 듣자왔는때), I am startled anew" to "The fact that [someone] predicted they would enter nirvana (入寂할 것) on the first anniversary [of a death] and indeed carried this out is something that causes endless astonishment (驚歎不已) even after a thousand years (千載下)".

Furthermore, in item 76, change 法興社 (Pŏphŭngsa - Pŏphŭng Society) to 法興寺 (Pŏphŭngsa - Pŏphŭng Temple) and 將電 (changjŏn - general's telegram?) to 將軍 (changgun - General).<25>

**Summary**

This is a correction notice (errata) for an article titled "The Ethical Conclusion of Naeseon Ilch'e" by Chŏng Kyo-wŏn, published in the New Year 1941 issue of Samch'ŏlli magazine. It corrects specific words and phrases, changing terms related to aid, death honorifics, the term for Koreans and Japanese, a specific quote, a temple name, and a military rank/title. From a historical perspective, the most revealing corrections are the change from `Namsŏn in'gan` (Southern Korean people) to `Naesŏn in'gan` (Japanese and Korean people), explicitly reflecting the assimilationist `Naeseon Ilch'e` (Japan and Korea as One Body) policy, and the addition of the imperial honorific prefix `御` (O/Gyō) to `薨去` (demise), indicating enforced reverence towards the Japanese Imperial house or high-ranking figures associated with it. These linguistic adjustments highlight the political pressures and ideological conformity demanded during this period.
