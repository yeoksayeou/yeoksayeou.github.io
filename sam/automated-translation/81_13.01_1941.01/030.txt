On-site Reports from Korean Compatriots at Home and Abroad, Korean Development Strategies, New Year's Addresses

From Manchukuo to the People within Korea
Manchukuo and Koreans in its Tenth Year of Foundation
Ch'ŏngwŏn Pŏmik (Former name: Yi Pŏmik), Councilor, Manchukuo Government

Respectfully reply. I sincerely wish for the ever-increasing prosperity of your esteemed company.
I was honored by your request to contribute to the special issue being published for the New Year, the fifth year of the Holy War (聖戰). However, I was away on travel from the middle of last month and only returned to the capital yesterday, so I feel regretful for the delay.
Regarding the present situation and future of the 1.5 million compatriots from the Peninsula residing in Manchuria (在滿洲), there are various views among individuals. As for myself, while I am not entirely without some dissatisfaction regarding the current state, I am largely optimistic about the future and hold strong hopes, always maintaining a firm heart. However, henceforth, I earnestly desire the migration of individuals outstanding in finance and intellect from within Korea (鮮內).
At this time when the situation is increasingly busy, I pray that your company will further dedicate itself to serving the nation through writing (文章報國) and contribute to the great work of constructing the New East Asia. <48>

Beauty, Goodness, Justice, Peace
Pak Sŏgyun, Former Consul General to Poland

Beauty, Goodness, Justice, and Peace are the common aspirations of humankind. I pray for the global illumination of Eastern morality.

Words of Goodwill on the Occasion of the New Year
Yun Sangp'il, Manchukuo General Bureau of Development (滿州國開拓總局)

As we greet the New Year, when all the peoples of Greater Asia (大亞細亞) become one heart and one body to strive for the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere (大東亞共圈), together with the pioneering compatriots in Manchuria, I extend my distant wishes for everyone's health.

The Current State and Development Strategy for Koreans in Manchuria
Kong T'ak, President, Manchukuo-Mongolia Industrial Co., Ltd. (滿蒙産業株式會社)

The current situation of Koreans in Manchuria is lacking in many aspects, both materially (物) and spiritually (心). However, since the spirit governs the material, the spirit must first be controlled and corrected. To achieve this, there seem to be several countermeasures. First, the *Manchurian-Korean Daily News* (滿鮮日報) must be organized to take a more guiding position. Centered around this, the compatriots in Manchuria (在滿同胞) can express their thoughts to some extent.
Next, regarding the method of guiding Korean farmers in Manchuria, we hope for a unified government policy and sincere guidance.
Finally, I believe great figures must emerge from various places, possessing the practical ability to guide and unify the farmers in each region.
Even if the first and second plans do not succeed, if this third plan is realized, it seems our hopes can be achieved.
The success or failure of pioneering settlers (開拓民) largely depends on their leaders. If many such leading figures emerge, our compatriots can achieve stability. Having traveled extensively through the corners of Manchuria over the years, I was greatly pleased to discover many hidden individuals of character. The history of paddy field development (水田開拓) in Manchuria is filled with the tears of nameless leaders. Countless words about development strategies are useless; I hope for effectiveness in various practical guidance policies that control the material, strengthening public opinion platforms like the *Manchurian-Korean Daily News* or the Concordia Association (協和會) to control the spirit. Whether these work or not, I wish to place great hope in the existence of leading personalities.

Development Strategy for Koreans in Manchuria
Yi Sŏnrang, Managing Director, Manchukuo-Mongolia Industrial Co., Ltd. (滿蒙産業株式會社常務)

(1) New Year's Goodwill Message (To Compatriots in the Homeland (內地同胞諸位)) <49>
Until last year, I believe many of us were bewildered by the rapid changes in the surrounding situation (四圍情勢).
However, constructing the most sound New Order (新秩序) for the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere (東亞共榮圈) has become the great mission imposed upon us by enduring human history. We must cleanly disregard individual fortunes and misfortunes, prepare for and practice all sacrifices for the path of survival and progress for the whole.
Our path forward, our indicator, has already clearly emerged, transcending petty national distinctions. The most crucial matter, I think, lies in bold implementation. This is not a time for mutual hesitation or suspicion, but a time to advance courageously with absolute conviction in our noble mission. In this sense, what I especially hope for from you, compatriots in the homeland (內地同胞諸位), is that within the past social structure, which can be seen as the most organized compared to Manchuria (滿) and China (支), you cease devising stopgap measures for immediate comfort (目前의 拘安策), become a little more honest, a little braver, and sacrifice yourselves for the construction of the new system (新體制).
Regardless of age, let those whose minds are moldy (곰팽이 쓴 분들) not speak of a diplomatic, social new system. Even if there is some risk of roughness, let those with cleaner hearts and newer spirits make silent sacrifices for the new system.

(2) The Current State of Koreans in Manchuria and Their Development Strategy
Setting aside individual reports on various sectors, if I were to describe the overall atmosphere (雰圍氣) of Korean compatriots in Manchuria, I would say that since last autumn, a movement of self-restraint and self-discipline (自肅自與) as Korean subjects (鮮系國民) has been boldly advancing. Clear examples include the activities of the Education Support Association (敎育後援會) and the movement of our East Dam District Special Work Support Association (우리 동담지구별 공작후원회). In particular, the movement of the Southeast District Special Work Support Association (東南地區 特別工作後援會) is seen as a self-restraint and self-discipline movement of absolute significance for us Korean subjects in Manchuria. In the emerging empire of ethnic harmony (民族協和), this movement represents sincere self-reflection (自巳反省) and self-correction (自巳肅法) by our compatriots. The brilliant achievements of this movement will surely bring good influence politically, socially, and spiritually to the Korean subjects in the future. I believe that by boldly promoting such a movement of self-reflection, a development strategy for Koreans in Manchuria will naturally arise. Before expressing undue feelings of superiority towards other ethnic groups or voicing baseless complaints, I believe the eternal path to survival – the development strategy – will be established by diligently engaging in solemn self-reflection and criticism. <50>

Koreans in Manchuria

Hong Yangmyŏng, Editor-in-Chief, *Manchurian-Korean Daily News* (滿鮮日報編輯局長)

To the people within Korea, I hope that in the New Year, you will take every opportunity to actually inspect Manchukuo and also pay attention to and research the various trends within Manchukuo. From my recent several trips to Seoul (서울), I keenly felt that most people within Korea whom I know have an extremely inadequate understanding of this place. Today, when extraterritoriality has already been abolished, people still talk about "consulate police, etc." Today, when the sale and purchase of grain within Manchukuo are completely controlled under a unified system, I have often heard requests out of touch with the times, such as asking for help buying sesame seeds from Manchuria, or inquiries like "Hey, can't you get some sort of concession (利權) there?" These are delusions behind the times, stemming from ignorance of the actual situation in Manchukuo, which is at the forefront of the New System (新體制).
When one crosses the Amnok River (鴨綠江) and Tuman River (豆滿江) from Korea and sets foot in Manchukuo, one keenly feels the truly inseparable neighboring relationship between Korea and Manchukuo. Whether riding a train within Manchukuo or visiting some corner of a rural village, one can commonly see the figures of Koreans everywhere. The fact that 1.5 million Koreans live in this land, more than anything else, evokes a sense of closeness. If only the memory of undergoing customs inspections when the train crosses the Manchukuo border and being questioned by the mobile police station were erased, the feeling of oneness between Manchuria and Korea (滿鮮一如感) among most Koreans in Manchuria is such that they lack even the consciousness of having traveled between different countries. The Concordia Uniform (協和服), the national dress of Manchukuo, has hidden buttons (가꾸시보단), while the national dress within Korea has exposed buttons and a belt (띄); aside from this, all aspects of the new lifestyle system (生活新體制) are not very different. The point that most farmers sell their rice (쌀) and eat millet (粟), content with a frugal life, diligently advancing along the lines of national policy (國策線), is also the same. However, one difference is that Koreans within Manchukuo have a dual spiritual duty: to be loyal subjects (忠良한 臣民) of the Japanese Empire and also faithful, pioneering citizens (忠實한 先達的 國民) of Manchukuo, the nation of morality based on ethnic harmony (民族協和), which is the cornerstone of the East Asian Cooperative Body (東亞協同體). Nevertheless, Koreans within Korea and Koreans within Manchukuo are entirely identical in their conviction that the completion of the New Order in East Asia (東亞新秩序), a sacred task unprecedented in history (曠古의 聖業), will further improve the lives of Koreans compared to the present, bringing hope and happiness. <51> Feeling this hope and happiness, they consider it glorious to persevere through the hardships of the current extraordinary new system lifestyle under the august power (威光) of the Japanese Empire and advance forward.

Letters from Compatriots Residing in China (支那)
Shanghai (上海) and Compatriots
Yi Kabyŏng (李甲寧), Chairman, Shanghai Korean Residents' Association (上海居留朝鮮人民會長)

[Original text in Japanese]
Currently, about 8,000 compatriots from the peninsula reside in Shanghai. This is an astonishing increase temporally, triggered by the current Incident (事變), and their asset levels are also surprising. Their standard of living is likely the highest throughout Manchuria and China (全滿支). Of course, this is superficial and lacks any internal substance; rather, there is excessive luxury. This is due to the influence of being in an international city, needing to maintain face as international people, and seeing and hearing only the shortcomings of material civilization, especially Americanism (アソリカズム). Generally, many compatriots living overseas hold outrageous views of life. They are extremely decadent (デカタン), realist (リアリスト), and extremely egoistic (ヱゴィスト). It would be better if they were thorough about it, but they are not. They conveniently say or do selfish things as they please. Therefore, the beautiful customs of unity (團結) or mutual aid (相助) among compatriots are not seen. It is truly a heart-wrenching and regrettable situation.
From now on in China (支那), depending on our will, effort, sincerity, and way forward, there is a future for further development.
However, in the current state, it would not be an exaggeration to say that it is entirely hopeless (見邊なり). As national policies (國策) strengthen gradually, and stronger control is implemented in various fields, especially commerce and industry, our compatriots must make up their minds and reform. With the mindset and way of life up to now, not only can further development not be hoped for, but rather, self-destruction (自滅) in the near future is unavoidable.
There are often those who say things like, "Having come all the way to China (overseas)..." etc. Whether one is in Korea (鮮內), China, or the South Pole, a Korean (Japanese) is undoubtedly a Korean (朝鮮人(日本人)). <52>
Being Korean means that wherever one is, it is one's duty (本分) to live together with compatriots and share joys and sorrows.
If one acts selfishly during easy times, constantly causing trouble for leaders and other compatriots, and only thinks of ancestors, relies on compatriots, and seeks protection from the state during hard times, the future is dark. It is truly a troubling matter.
However, the author is fully aware that it is impossible to reform such ethnic characteristics (民族的性格) overnight. Yet, if we wish to sustain our lives overseas and hope for the prosperity of our descendants for generations to come, reflecting on the flaws of this character and fundamentally reforming it is the prerequisite issue currently imposed upon us. Only then will the proper path for us to advance be opened.
This passage reflects a matter that constantly troubles the author's mind, but as we greet the New Year, it is sincere advice offered to our compatriots.

Greeting the Fifth New Year of the Japan-China Incident (日支事變)
Chang Chaebok, Culture Bureau, Central China Liaison Office, Kōa-in (興亞院 華中連絡部 文化局), Shanghai

Greeting the fifth New Year of the Incident, I respectfully extend congratulations to all compatriots (同胞諸位) in the homeland (故國) and take this opportunity to write a few words of my thoughts for the New Year through the pages of *Samch'ŏlli* (三千里).
Human society has undergone numerous transformations and innovations since the dawn of history, as the past thousands of years of history serve as our mirror, something you all know well. In modern times, our East Asian peoples (東亞民族) lagged far behind Western nations in material civilization, that is, modern scientific civilization. This can be seen as having incubated the great incident (大事變) in East Asia like today's. If our East Asian peoples had embarked on overseas expansion like Westerners in the 18th or 19th century, would the great sacrifice, the tragedy of the East Asian peoples caused by Western machinations (西洋人의 策動), have begun today? However, the turning point of history has finally arrived. Only in modern times did our pioneers (先覺者) awaken from their long slumber and deeply realize that East Asia produced East Asians and exists for East Asians. In China, there was the foresight of the late Mr. Sun Yat-sen (故 孫文先生) and Mr. Wang Ching-wei (汪精衛先生), who advocated Greater Asianism (大亞細亞主義), stating that to protect East Asia, the East Asian peoples must unite. However, failing to see the larger picture and holding narrow regional views, anti-Japanese elements (抗日分子), along with the machinations of third countries (第3國) worried about losing their interests in East Asia, formed the anti-Japanese Chiang regime (蔣政權) and started the Incident. Now, the fifth year has arrived, yet they continue their resistance (抗戰). This only turns their own country into scorched earth (焚土化) <53> and brings no benefit whatsoever. It is abundantly clear, yet they still rely on the behind-the-scenes maneuvering (背後策動) of third countries that fear the new order (新秩序), seemingly waiting only for the arrival of a miscalculated opportune moment (迷夢의 誤算인 時期到來). So, which are these third countries that fear the construction of the new order? Since the 18th and 19th centuries, it has been the British Empire (英帝國) of liberalism and capitalism. During that time, Britain held global hegemony (世界에 제패권), boasting of a Great British Empire where the sun never set, invading many nations and acquiring vast territories. However, today, it faces a turning point in history where preserving this is difficult. Germany (獨伊), being a have-not nation, could hardly leave the British Empire to monopolize prosperity forever. Thus, the fight for the construction of a new order in Europe, the Second Great European War (第2歐洲大戰), broke out. The United States (美國), largely of the same Anglo-Saxon (앙그로삭손) race as Britain, shares racial sympathy and possesses vast territory and abundant resources. Anticipating that the construction of a new order would be disadvantageous to itself and foreseeing a future crisis for the Anglo-Saxon race, it has sided with Britain, taking actions consistent with Britain as before, and has not withdrawn its uneasy hand of support for the Chiang regime. However, the protagonist of the old order, the aged British Empire, is facing collapse and imminent death. Nations groaning under the oppression of imperialism are responding favorably to the construction of the new order. Therefore, the completion of the new order within our New East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere (新東亞共榮圈) is in the not-too-distant future.
Now, to complete such a great and sacred task (偉大聖業), we must first be prepared for the unspeakable hundred difficulties (百難) that lie ahead, both materially (物的) and humanly (人的). However, whatever storms (波蘭 - likely a typo for 波瀾, meaning waves/turmoil) may come, whatever hardships (艱苦) we face, we must overcome this extraordinary period (非常時期). Look at Germany today, boasting of its greatness. Who could have imagined when it was defeated in the First World War (第1次大戰) that Germany would rise again and display such great power (偉力) as it does today? At that time, Germany faced international pressure (國際的强壓) from outside, and domestically, public sentiment (民心) was utterly fragmented (四分五裂) and extremely unstable. Yet, Hitler (히틀러), seen as a patriot (愛國家) at the time, rose up resolutely, exerted all efforts to rally public opinion, and aiming for Germany's reconstruction, proclaimed, "All comrades must prioritize the common good (公利) of the cooperative body (協同體) over individual interests (各自의 利益) as a principle and adhere to it." The people united with Hitler's every move, becoming like one cohesive body (한덩이 技體 - likely 肢體, body/limb), persevering for over 20 years. Without regard for the hardships (辛酸) of the wartime system lifestyle, they reached today, building the Great Germany that reigns over Europe. Isn't that so?
Therefore, for this decisive battle (乾坤一蹴의 此一戰) that determines the future destiny, aiming for the freedom of us East Asians and the prosperity of the East Asian peoples within the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, <54> until this Incident is resolved, we must naturally trust our leadership, the government, and the military. Internally within the nation, spiritual unity (精神的 團結) is paramount. Workers in factories, merchants in markets, farmers on farms, scientists in laboratories, media outlets with their pens (筆端), students in schools – each according to their heavenly calling (天職), must persevere with indomitable spirit (百折不屈) no matter what difficulties arise. Realizing their role as members contributing to the construction of the new order within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, I hope they will make contributions. Finally, I pray for the health of all compatriots.
November 27, Showa 15 (1940)

Shanghai and Koreans
Kang Rohyang, Literary Department, Shanghai Zhonghua Film Company (上海中華映畵會社 文藝部)

1. Just because the New Year is coming, nothing special comes to mind as words of goodwill. I just sincerely hope that everyone continues to develop their assigned duties steadily and faithfully. Lately, I feel even more strongly how precious "passion" (情熱) is in our lives. To everyone residing in the Korean homeland (朝鮮內地), although another year has passed, I hope the "passion" in your hearts becomes ever more fierce, youthful, and beautiful. I think all plans and departures come after that.
2. I say this not just because I have lived in Shanghai for a total of 8 years, but because I can indeed be considered one who knows well the lives of Korean compatriots residing in Shanghai. As such, there is so much I want to say and write addressed to the resident compatriots (在留同胞) (only to the resident compatriots). However, it seems few resident Korean compatriots would pay attention if I spoke or wrote it, so I am rather remaining silent (黙黙不言) and just striving forward on my own path. There's nothing more to say, but one thing I must say to the Koreans residing in Shanghai, especially to the so-called "Shanghai-produced Korean notables" (上海産朝鮮名士) gentlemen who consider themselves part of the leadership stratum (指導層), is to take a moment to reflect on yourselves and engage in self-criticism (自巳批判).
Also, to those in the Korean homeland, please don't get overly excited shouting "Shanghai, Shanghai!" and absolutely refrain from impulsive trips to the continent (大陸行) based on mere whim (氣分的). Due to these unwelcome impulsive crossings, <55> countless human tragedies occur centered around the Korean community in places like Shanghai. When these tragedies are "closed-up" (클로-즈·엎) in a corner of an international city like Shanghai, the unfavorable impression they cast in various quarters is beyond description by pen or tongue (筆舌).
One more thing, this is particularly an opinion for those engaged in cultural work (文化工作). According to rumors carried on the wind lately, it seems "China experts" (中國通) have suddenly multiplied enormously in the streets, and consequently, books about China seem to be published one after another. However, looking at a translation by a certain Mr. X in Tokyo (東京) the other day, out of 10,000 characters in the original Chinese text, there were no fewer than 1,800 mistranslations (誤譯). Yet, to publish this in the world saying "hoping this might be of some help to China studies..." – the sheer audacity (强心臟) was utterly dumbfounding.
Let us use such examples as a mirror and mutually refrain from such utterly shameless reckless acts (妄擧). In fact, isn't it common sense (常識) that translating a piece of Chinese writing or writing an essay on China is not accomplished so easily?
Finally, to the unknown brothers who occasionally send letters, please accept this short piece as my reply, and I ask for your forgiveness (恕諒).

Letters Sent from Tokyo and Osaka
Current State and Development of Koreans in Tokyo
Chŏng In'ik (鄭寅翼), Editor-in-Chief, *Maeil Sinbo* (每日新報社 編輯局長)

[Original text in Japanese]
1. Response to Question 1
Since I myself am in a situation straddling both Kyŏngsŏng (京城) and Tokyo (東京), I am actually not in a position to speak as a resident of Tokyo. However, having received your kind inquiry, I cannot simply say, "Well, due to my position, please excuse me," so I will write down what comes to mind.
Generally, it seems that everyone in Korea (朝鮮) is perhaps far too indifferent towards Korean compatriots who have emigrated to the mainland (內地, i.e., Japan) or other places outside Korea. Of course, the consideration shown by compatriots who left Korea towards Korea might also not be praiseworthy, but I am speaking now from the perspective of having left Korea...
From the standpoint of those who have left their hometown, they do not know how lonely and sad it is to be treated as complete strangers, as if "he is he, I am I." Of course, the mainland and Korea are separated only by a narrow strip of water (一葦帶水), and being the mainland, it's the same country, plus there are authorities (お上) looking after things, so one might say things will work out fine even if left alone. But this is talk that doesn't understand the subtleties of human feeling (人情の機微). To give a mundane example, even if everything is going so smoothly that you don't need to worry about guardianship, I think it's natural to have some exchange of inquiries about celebrations or condolences (慶弔相問), or perhaps greetings for seasonal changes (節季の變り日). Especially, something even bigger than that is, when one has entrusted one's own relatives to live with others and be taken care of, isn't it common courtesy (義理) and etiquette (禮儀) to express gratitude or at least offer greetings to those providing care?
Such thoughtfulness, even if the Korean compatriots here have committed errors deserving scolding from everyone on the mainland, would open a path to clear forgiveness and tolerance, and furthermore, perhaps allow us to anticipate a harmonious future.
Also, there are many people who come to the mainland and work very honestly and diligently, whether in public or private capacities. Among them, it seems there are quite a few who are engaged in various social welfare activities (社會施設的仕事) for those compatriots who are indebted, both materially and spiritually, to everyone on the mainland. Of course, they carry out this respectable work starting from scratch (裸一貫), continuing struggles that seem to draw blood (血が滲れ樣な奮鬪), but it is most regrettable that I have never heard of them receiving heartfelt support (人情ある御聲援) from influential people within Korea.
Conversely, everyone on the mainland provides sincere support, both material and spiritual, for this kind of work, as if it were their natural duty (當然なる義務), doubly and triply so. It is truly unbearable shame (慚愧に堪へない). And sometimes, people ask why peninsula people lack mutual obligation and human feeling (義理人情). It is truly inexcusable.
To undo such dishonor (不名譽), the self-awareness (自覺) of peninsula people currently residing on the mainland is certainly necessary, but what is more pressing is the concern (關心) and sentiment of mutual assistance (扶助の情誼) from everyone within Korea towards Korean compatriots who have emigrated to the mainland. Entrusting one's relatives to others' care and then acting like strangers is not praiseworthy by any measure (引■目に見ても - likely 引っ込み目に見ても, even viewing modestly). This <57> is by no means just a request for material things. First, if everyone develops such feelings from the heart, corresponding measures will naturally emerge. Some might say, "The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak" (心はあつても力がないから), but this likely stems from a mindset of "not doing, rather than not being able" (不爲非不能).
At the beginning of a joyous new year, offering unpleasant frank advice (苦言) might seem contrary to the spirit of goodwill (交歡の意). However, rather than exchanging superficial congratulatory words while actually wearing faces as if chewing bitter herbs (苦虫を嚙み潰した樣な顔), I thought exchanging frank advice might lead to sharing actual joy throughout this year, which could be the ultimate expression of goodwill. Hence, I venture to offer these words.

2. Response to Question 2
The current situation of Korean compatriots on the mainland can be summarized in one phrase: they are full of the energy to survive (生延びんとする力). "First, let's establish a way of life (生活の方途), and only when we reach a state of security (安堵の域) will we have the mental余裕 (心の餘裕) for other things" – this seems to be the feeling of most people. For this reason, they appear to be recklessly (我武者ら) racing only along the course of livelihood (生計のコース). Given this state, naturally, there seems to be nothing distinct (*something* ■つたものはない - text likely missing character) that can be presented in the manner of "Ah, yes, there is!" across the sectors mentioned in your question, such as education, industry, economy, and culture. Of course, in individual cases, there are successful people who make others quite envious, but this is limited to a very small number of individuals and, when discussing Koreans residing here as a whole, it is negligible, offering no strength or pride.
In short, education, industry, economy, and also culture must be created from collective strength (集團された力), possess commonality for the entire group, and eventually develop connections with others. However, the circumstances of Koreans residing on the mainland until now did not afford the leeway (餘裕) to prepare for such things, and perhaps there was no need for distinctively Korean overall industrial promotion (產業振作) or cultural construction (文化建設). In reality, it is no exaggeration to say that practically nothing soundly undertaken under the banner of "for Koreans" (朝鮮人の爲めの……標語) has existed throughout history.
Everyone has simply strived, in their respective positions, to protect their own livelihood and avoid becoming dropouts from life (生活の落伍者). Consequently, as mentioned here, one or two individually successful people occasionally appear, and the general standard of living also seems to have improved somewhat.
Such is the state described above. However, since more than 80% of the million Koreans residing on the mainland <58> have not yet reached a sphere of life to be proud of, people mostly preoccupied with subsistence (喰ふ事に囚れ勝ちな人共) cannot possibly have the余裕 (餘裕) to think about organized, systematic education, industry, economy, or culture.
However, on the other hand, what gives strength is the recent point where these compatriots have completely risen above the futile spiritual desolation (徒らなる 心の荒び) of some years ago and clearly show a serious attitude (眞面目さ) of fighting through life with composure (落着き拂つた態度) and single-mindedness (一心不亂). In short, like wheels on a fixed track (定軌の上に乘つた車輪), this time, without derailing, if they run skillfully along the track, they will eventually be rewarded and reach the intended destination. Now, everyone hopes for that time to come even one day sooner, but this too is difficult to achieve through individual effort alone.
Henceforth, the development and improvement of people of Korean origin residing on the mainland depend absolutely on their own efforts, but results will only be achieved when the sincere efforts (心盡し) of the mainland and Korean authorities (內鮮當局) and the cooperation (協力) of everyone in Korea are added.

Tokyo and the Issue of Korean Students Studying Abroad
Chŏn Kyuhong, Professor, Chuo University, Tokyo (東京中央大學敎授)

[Original text in Japanese]
Respectfully acknowledged.
Thank you for your letter, which I have read gratefully. I am also humbled that you seem to have sent a telegram (the telegram appears to have been lost by the school attendant, so I haven't seen the text yet, but upon inquiring about its content, I was told it meant 'Send the paper quickly,' so I infer it was a telegram from your company). According to your letter, your company plans to introduce the circumstances of overseas compatriots, which I find truly meaningful. You requested a manuscript from me on this matter, but as I had been traveling for several days and returned to Tokyo on the 29th of last month, I had given up, thinking I could never meet the deadline of the 30th. However, hearing yesterday that another telegram had apparently arrived, and being somewhat busy with end-of-term exams and year-end matters, I cannot quickly write a composed manuscript. Facing your kind plan, my lack of sincerity seems evident, and I cannot send a hastily written piece unbecoming of seriousness. I deeply apologize to your company. However, should there be another opportunity, I would like to prepare thoroughly and send something then, so I hope you will understand without taking offense. <59>
Although you requested something simple, regarding reflections on bidding farewell to the old year and welcoming the new, for us, there should be no difference whatsoever between then and now. At this literal, unprecedented turning point in world history, being unable to play any role, what could a Korean possibly open their mouth to say? This is my frank feeling. I believe we too must pay a little more attention to the world situation, face reality directly, feel and recognize our powerlessness a bit more, rouse ourselves, and cultivate practical strength (實力); there is nothing else.
Regarding the situation of compatriots residing in Tokyo, I am poorly informed and do not know the overall picture well. However, concerning the Korean students I interact with daily, I have some feelings and thoughts. But these are difficult to express simply, which is regrettable. Nevertheless, one aspect I constantly consider is this: the parents and guardians of the over 15,000 Korean students studying in Tokyo simply send their children to Tokyo, remit the requested amount of money, and then seem completely unaware of what kind of lives they lead and how they are studying. Shouldn't the parents themselves proactively devise concrete measures to improve this current situation?
I assume your company is well aware of the kind of life the majority of the 15,000 Korean students lead. Leaving this current situation unattended is largely due to the absence of their seniors (先輩) in Tokyo, which is one major reason. Another, I constantly think, is perhaps not so much that the parents are indifferent, but rather that they haven't truly considered their policy for guiding and educating their children. If your company has the opportunity, I sincerely request, as someone in the teaching profession, that you arouse the concern of the parents back home and convey the message that they should be a little more serious (眞劍) for the sake of their children's education.
It is extremely rude (無禮) of me to make requests without complying with your command, but as explained at the beginning, the circumstances are such. Therefore, I sincerely hope for your understanding.
With disorganized writing, I offer my apologies and request. Sincerely,
December 6th

Current State of Korean Compatriots Residing in Osaka
Pak Yŏngsu, Director, Osaka Higashiichi Co., Ltd. (大阪東一株式會社重役)

Upon receiving the request to contribute regarding the current state and development strategy of Koreans as a gesture of goodwill (交歡) for the New Year, I felt compelled to take up my pen. However, lacking statistical tables at hand and having insufficient dedication (誠意) to such issues平时 (usually), I regret that I cannot provide a faithful report and will conclude with a brief account of the current situation.
Approximately 310,000 Korean compatriots reside within Osaka Prefecture (大阪府下), actively participating in various industrial sectors. Spurred by the military boom following the Manchurian Incident (滿洲事變), until the spring of last year (Showa 15 / 1940), there were no unemployed. Among them, some with relative affluence (餘裕) even established small and medium-sized factories, leading to the emergence of wealthy individuals (致富者) with assets ranging from 300,000-400,000 yen (圓) up to several tens of thousands of yen or more, achieving rapid development. However, generally speaking, the economic standard (經濟的 水準) is low. Since development historically occurred under the concept of a free economy (自由經濟), the recent sudden whirlwind of the controlled economy (統制經濟) has hit hard those who had rapidly expanded their businesses, and some seem to be affected by the changing tides (世波). Yet, the vast majority of these individuals are warriors (勇士) who crossed the Genkai Sea (玄海灘 - Korea Strait) empty-handed (赤手空拳) and fought fiercely through hardships. Therefore, they are not pessimistic about the future. Although temporary suffering (苦痛) is unavoidable, through such experiences, their foundation (礎基) will become more solid, and they will likely gain a clearer understanding of planned enterprise (計劃的 企業).
Furthermore, school-aged children (學齡兒童) of compatriots residing in Osaka all receive compulsory education (義務敎育) and attend elementary school, so there are no difficulties in children's education. Roughly, the numbers are: over 15,000 elementary students, over 800 middle school students, and over 250 students in vocational schools or higher. Our greatest hope lies in their growth; when they become core youth (中堅靑年) in the future and advance into all fields as pillars of society (社會の 役軍), living more orderly lives, it is presumed that the economic standard and general treatment (一般的 대우) will improve in the near future.
More importantly, since Osaka is an industrial city, the occupations of compatriots here are predominantly factory workers (職工) and day laborers (自由勞働者). On the other hand, as it is the sole major commercial and industrial city in the East (東洋唯一의 商工都市), individuals can cultivate business acumen (商才) and acquire skills (技術) in their respective workplaces. Therefore, while they will naturally strive for this region substantively in the future, I believe they will also advance into the Korea-Manchuria region (鮮滿地方) hereafter and play important roles in various sectors.

The Basic Stance of Korean Culture
Kim Chonghan, Reporter, *Fujin Gahō* (婦人畵報 - Women's Pictorial), Tokyo

[Original text in Japanese]
1. *Section missing* (*中欠體*)
2. In times like these, when literature transitions to culture, and culture to politics, <61> literature that is praised out of necessity emerges. Critics praise it consciously (while wanting to flee). Being praised feels uncomfortable.
The interest in Korean literature within the mainland literary circles (內地の文壇), which has been increasing daily since the Incident (事變), seems to be precisely of this nature. It doesn't seem like a cultural plan for the next hundred years (文化百年之計). Even if journalism (ジヤアナリズム) spasmodically promotes figures like Yi Kwangsu (李光洙) or Kojŏng (古丁), what can it contribute to the accumulation of solemn cultural assets (文化財)? But if the era demands it, perhaps it can't be helped. Such is the era now. And perhaps that is fine.
However, what we must not forget in this case is that this is a transitional period (過渡期). In other words, the recent trend towards cultural centralization (文化の中央集權的な動向) centered around Tokyo is merely a preparatory exercise (準備運動) for tomorrow's culture.
I believe that once this preparatory exercise of centralized, new culture is over, an era where decentralized culture (地方分權的な文化) sprouts will surely follow in sequence. That is, I think the day will come when culture characteristic of Korea (朝鮮には朝鮮らしい), culture characteristic of Manchuria (滿洲には滿洲らしい), will discover its own mission and position within the searchlight (サアチライト) of the new system (新體制) and must adopt a stance towards new autonomy (新しい自律獨への 姿勢 - text seems incomplete).
〇
For example, when Kikuchi Kan (菊池寬) declared that Japanese short stories are by no means inferior to those overseas, I want to counter-ask if he has the courage to export Japanese literature to France. That is, it's not that Japanese literature is boring, but that French literature is not poor enough to necessitate importing Japanese literature. That's all there is to it. I believe the same can be said for Korean literature.
In other words, the mainland literary circles are not poor enough to necessitate importing Korean literature. Therefore, even if the sales of the Korean Literature Selection (朝鮮文學選集) on the mainland are poor, it doesn't bring dishonor to Korean writers. That's all there is to it.
Originally, the external value (對外的價値) of a work seems to require various incidental conditions besides the value of the work itself. My opinion is that, at best, the works worth introducing to the mainland are Pak T'aewŏn's (朴泰遠) *Riverside Scene* (川邊風景) and Yi Kwangsu's (李光洙) *Avidyā* (無明). This is not necessarily because these works are superior to Kim Namch'ŏn's (金南天) *Taiga* (大河) or Yi Kiyŏng's (李箕永) *Hometown* (故鄕).
Similar things can be said for short stories; the works that weren't strange when translated were, as I recall, those of Yu Chino (俞鎭午) and Yi Hyosŏk (李孝石) <62>. Even Kim Sowol's (金素雲 - likely Kim Sowun or referring to Kim Soun's translations) *Milk-Colored Clouds* (乳色の雲), mainland youths under thirty-five probably didn't really read it.
〇
Yes, let me state my conclusion clearly. What's the point if two or three writers float up in the mainland literary circles, pushed by the trends of the times or journalism? Even for someone untalented like me, there are one or two seniors at the Akutagawa Prize selector level (芥川賞選者級の先輩) who suggest publishing a poetry collection, but seeing the miserable conduct (悲慘な行狀) of writers like Chang Hyŏkchu (張赫宙) and Kim Saryang (金史良) in the mainland literary circles, I just can't muster the courage. That's all there is to it.
〇
When I returned to Korea (歸鮮) on company business after a long time, I was saddened to encounter some Korean writers wearing expressions like "No more—Oh never more!".
Perhaps after a while, the day will come when the basic stance (基本姿勢) for Korean culture to be autonomous will become clear. And hope and trust in the new culture will be born.
(At that time, I intend to return to Korea too. Working long as a cheap magazine reporter seems to corrupt a person, so when I return to Kyŏngsŏng (京城), I plan to open a yakitori shop (燒鳥屋) or something and write poetry.)

Ideals High, Reality Accurate
Pyŏn Sŏngnyŏl, Dōmei News Agency (同盟通信社), Tokyo

[Original text in Japanese]
Dear Sirs, Today, the fourth day after receiving the telegram, I finally received the postcard and the sealed letter. When I received the telegram, I couldn't quite figure it out, but today it finally became clear. The sealed letter was addressed as "Telegram Communication" (電報通信), so it arrived just now with three or four slips attached to the envelope. Although the order is mixed up, with famous company presidents and directors lined up neatly to the right, I, being unsuitable for such company, will refrain. Since the deadline has already passed, writing today would be pointless. Besides, I am currently busy writing an English monograph (英文單行本) to be published within the year. I apologize for the inconvenience and ask for your understanding. Words of goodwill (交歡の言葉) have already been written elsewhere, so I have exhausted them. If you insist I write something, I would say, "Ideals high, reality accurate" (理想は高く現實は正確に).
(The following manuscript arrived late and was placed at the end)

Wuhan and Koreans
Yu Sang'ŭn, Principal, Hankou Peace Japanese Language School (漢口和平日語學校長)

To greet the New Year, the fifth year of the Holy War (聖戰), in the Wuhan (武漢) tri-cities, the heartland of China's four hundred-plus provinces, and pray for the Emperor's eternal longevity (聖壽無疆) is indeed an occasion for immense celebration <63>. Over two years have passed since the Imperial Army (皇軍) entered Wuhan on October 27, Showa 13 (1938). The population of the Wuhan tri-cities has surpassed one million, and the Japanese population (邦人 - including Koreans) exceeds ten thousand, making it a truly ideal realm of peace (理想的平和境). The people of Wuhan now, forgetting the dust of war, sleep in peace and awaken to construction. The reality of Japan-China becoming one family, one heart, one virtue (日支一家一心同德) is now being realized.
The resident compatriots from the peninsula (在留半島同胞) are also very well-off economically, with each person reportedly having funds averaging over one thousand yen (圓). The living standards of the Chinese people are also far more affluent compared to Manchuria, North China, etc.
This demonstrates the abundance of goods in the Jiangnan region (江南地方), the Yangtze River basin (揚子江流域). Furthermore, Hankou (漢口) has long been called the "meeting place of nine provinces" (九省の會), being a trade center where goods from nine of China proper's eighteen provinces converge, accessible from all directions. In the future, coinciding with the opening of the Peking-Hankow Railway (京漢鐵道), it is clearer than looking at fire (火る見るより明か - idiom for 'obvious') that this will become a paradise (樂天地) for the activities of our compatriots. On the significant New Year's Day of 2601 (Imperial year = 1941 AD), I offer silent prayers of gratitude (感謝の默禱) to the officers and soldiers of the Imperial Army at the front (前線) and the spirits of the war dead (戰歿英靈), pray for their continued military fortunes (武運長久), and pray for the health of everyone on the home front (銃後國內). <64>

Jews and Koreans in Shanghai
Kim Kyŏngjae, Vice President, *Shanghai Times* (上海時報社 副社長)

Greeting the New Year, my heart earnestly wishes much fortune (多福) for the brethren (兄弟) back home (안에).
I have been in Shanghai for a year and a half, busy making a living (밥버리). In Shanghai parlance (上海式 語套), it is presumptuous for a newcomer to Shanghai like me (新上海人) to convey Shanghai news.
Commonly said to be 7,000, I believe 4,500-4,600 compatriots (同胞) reside in Shanghai. If they are not given legitimate occupations (正當한 職業), it will be a major problem. To shed the dishonorable label (冠詞) of illicit traders (不正業者), we too must reflect (反省). This point is not unique to Shanghai but is a common problem for us living in Nanjing (南京), Hankou (漢口), etc.
It has only been two years since the Jews (猶太人) were expelled from Germany (獨逸) and came to Shanghai, yet they established themselves based in Yangshupu (楊樹浦) and built a prosperous urban area (繁華한 市街). I am absolutely not saying we should imitate the Jews, but comparing it to Qiujiang Road (虯(규)江路) where we live, there is a world of difference (天壤의 차).
There is a need to be diligent (勤勉), learn (배우고), hold sound occupations (健實한 職業), make stability of life (生活의 安定) the primary goal, reflect greatly, and strive hard.
This is a point that we living abroad must steadily strive for, and the brethren back home should also provide support (聲援) and encouragement (鞭撻).
<48-64>

**Summary**

This collection of New Year's messages from prominent Koreans residing in Manchukuo, Shanghai, Tokyo, and Osaka in 1941 reflects their perspectives on the situations of Korean diaspora communities and their visions for the future under the Japanese Empire's "New Order." Common themes include acknowledging hardships while expressing optimism for the future (often tied to Manchukuo's development or the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere), criticizing perceived shortcomings of fellow Koreans abroad (lack of unity, materialism, outdated thinking), emphasizing the need for self-reflection, discipline, and practical skills, and calling for greater connection and support between Koreans in the homeland and those overseas. The authors urge compatriots to adapt to the wartime reality, contribute to the "Holy War" effort and the construction of a "New East Asia," often using rhetoric aligning with Japanese imperial ideology and the Concordia Association's goals of ethnic harmony (within a Japan-dominated framework).

For historians, this article offers valuable insights into the mindset of certain elite or publicly active Koreans collaborating or operating within the Japanese imperial system during the peak of its expansion. It showcases the complex blend of nationalist sentiment (concern for Korean development and status) with accommodationist and pro-imperial rhetoric necessary for public expression at the time. The reports highlight the varying conditions and challenges faced by Koreans in different parts of the empire (Manchuria's settlement focus, Shanghai's cosmopolitan complexities, Japan's labor and student issues), the promotion of assimilationist concepts like "ethnic harmony" (民族協和) and the "New System" (新體制), and the explicit calls for Koreans to fulfill their "dual duty" as imperial subjects and members of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. The criticisms leveled against fellow Koreans also reveal internal tensions and differing strategies for navigating life under colonial rule.

滿洲國에서 朝鮮內人士에서게
建國十年의 滿洲와 朝鮮人
滿洲國政府參議 淸原範益(舊名 李範益)

拜復 貴社 益益淸榮하옵기를 仰祝耳.
聖戰 第5年의 新春을 마지하여 特別號를 發行하시는데 投稿해 달라시는 指命의 榮을 입었으나 先月 中旬부터 出他하였다기 昨日 歸京하여 期日이 늦어젔음으로 未安하게 생각하나이다.
在滿洲 150萬 半島同胞의 現狀 及 將來에 대해서는 各人 各樣의 見解가 있지만 迂生으로서는 大體로 現狀에 있어선 多少 不滿이 없는 바 아니나 將來는 크게 樂觀하고 또한 囑望하여 늘 마음 强하게 있나이다. 但 今後는 鮮內로부터 財的으로 智的으로 優秀한 人士의 移住를 切望하여 마지 안나이다.
時局 益益多事한 때 貴社의 一層 文章報國의 誠을 다하여 新東亞建設의 偉業에 貢獻있기를 비나이다.＜48＞

美, 善, 正義, 平和
前 波蘭 總領事 朴錫胤

美, 善, 正義, 平和는 人類 共通의 憧憬입니다. 東洋道義의 世界光被를 祈願합니다.

新年에 際하여 交歡의 말
滿州國開拓總局 尹相弼

大亞細亞의 全民族이 一心一體가 되여 大東亞共圈의 建設에 努力할 新春을 마지하여 滿洲開拓同胞와 함께 멀리 여러분의 健康을 비나이다.

在滿朝鮮人現狀과 發展策
滿蒙産業株式會社長 孔濯

滿洲에 있는 朝鮮人의 現狀은 物心兩方으로 다 不足한 點이 많습니다. 그런데 物은 心이 支配하는 것이므로 心을 먼저 統制하고 修正하여야겠으므로 이리함에는 몇가지 對策이 있을것입니다. 먼저 滿鮮日報로 하여금 좀더 指導的 자리에 서도록 組織하여야 하겠습니다. 이것을 中心하여 在滿同胞가 어느 程道까지 心을 表現할 수 있겠지요.
다음에는 在滿朝鮮農民에 대한 指導方法에 있어 政府의 統一된 政策과 誠意있는 指導를 바람니다.
끝으로 各地에서 偉大한 人物이 많이 나타나서 地方 地方에서 農民을 指導 統一하는 實力을 가져야 할 줄 압니다.
1, 2安이 다 않된다 할지라도 이 3安이 實現되면은 우리 希望을 達할 수 있을 듯 합니다.
開拓民의 成敗는 大槪 그 指導者 如何에 달인 것이며 이런 指導的 人物이 많이 나타나면 同胞들은 安定될 수 있습니다. 이 사람은 年來로 滿洲의 구석구석을 많이 돌아 다녀본 가운데 숨은 人格者가 많이 있다는 것을 알고 대단 기벘읍니다. 滿洲의 水田開拓史 가운데는 이름 없는 指導者의 눈물이 많이 흘러 있습니다. 發展策에 대한 百言萬語가 다 所用없습니다, 心을 - 統制할 言論이나 協和會를 强化하여 物을 統制할 政策의 여러가지 實質的 指導에 有効性이 있기를 바라며 이것 저것이 되거나 않되드라도 指導的 人格의 存在에 많은 바람을 두고 싶습니다.

在滿朝鮮人發展策
滿蒙産業株式會社常務 李瑄桹

(1) 新年交歡之辭 (內地同胞諸位께)＜49＞
무근해까지 우리들은 四圍情勢의 急激한 變轉에 어리둥절한 바가 많었다고 믿습니다.
그러나 東亞共榮圈의 가장 健實한 新秩序를 建設해야만 될 것은 悠久한 人類歷史가 우리네에게 賦課한 重大使命으로 되었사오니 個人의 榮枯盛衰는 깨끗이 不問에 부치고 全體의 살 길, 나갈길을 위하여 모든 犧牲을 覺悟, 實踐해야만 될 줄 압니다.
우리의 進路, 우리의 指標는 이미 小我的인 民族的 區別을 超越하여 뚜렷이 나타난 바옵거니와 가장 緊要한 일은 대담한 實踐如何에 있다고 생각합니다. 서로 躊躇하거나 서로 猜疑할 待機가 아니고 거륵한 使命에 대하여 絶大한 信念을 가지고 勇往邁進해야만 될 줄 압니다. 이러한 意味에서 內地同胞諸位께 특히 바라옵는 바는 滿, 支方面에 比하여 가장 整備되었다고 볼 수 있는 過去의 社會組織內에서 目前의 拘安策을 講究코 더 알고 좀 더 솔직하고 좀더 勇敢하게 新體制建設에 犧牲하여 달나는 것입니다.
年齡의 老少는 別問題로 하고 머리 속에 곰팽이 쓴 분들로 하여금 外交辭會的인 新體制를 일컸게 말고 若干의 거치러질 危隅性이 있다 하드래로 좀 더 깨끗한 마음, 새로운 綪神의 所有者들이 新體制를 위하여 無言의 犧牲을 하여 달나는 것입니다.

(2) 在滿朝鮮人의 現狀과 그 發展策
各部門에 亙한 個別的 現狀 報告는 그만 두옵고 在滿朝鮮同胞의 全體的 雰圍氣를 말슴드린다면 昨秋以來 鮮系國民으로서 自肅自與의 運動이 대담하게 進展되어 있다고 봄니다. 뚜렷한 實例로는 敎育後援會의 활동으로 우리 동담지구별 공작후원회의 運動같은 것을 들 수 있으니 특히 東南地區 特別工作後援會의 運動은 우리들 在滿鮮系國民으로서 絶對意義를 가진 自肅自與運動으로 보고 있습니다. 民族協和의 新興帝國에 있어 우리 同胞로서 솔직한 自巳反省, 自巳肅法의 運動이 이 運動이니 이 運動의 光輝있는 實蹟은 將來鮮系國民에게 政治的으로 社會的으로 精神的으로 반듯이 좋은 影響을 가져 오리라고 봄니다. 이처럼 自我反省의 運動을 대담하게 促進시키는데서 뿐 滿洲에 있어 朝鮮人의 發展策이 스사로 생겨날 줄 믿습니다. 他民族에 대한 주제넘은 優越感이나 까닭 모를 不平不滿을 吐露하기 전에 우리 스사로 엄숙한 反省과 批判을 게을니 안하는데서 永遠한 살길- 發展策이 세워질 줄 믿습니다. ＜50＞

滿洲의 朝鮮人

滿鮮日報編輯局長  洪陽明

朝鮮內 人士들에게 新年에는 機會에 있는대로 滿洲國을 實際視察하기도 하고 또는 滿洲國內의 여러가지 動向에 着眼硏究하기를 바랍니다, 내가 아는 範圍內의 大部分의 朝鮮內 人士는 이곳에 대한 認識이 극히 不足한 느낌을 나는 最近 數次 서울에 갈 때마다 切感하였다, 治外法權이 벌써 撤廢된 오늘에 있어서 『領事舘警察云云』하고 滿洲國內의 糧穀의 買賣가 完全히 一貫的으로 統制된 오늘에 있어서 『깨』를 滿洲서 사오겠는데 斡旋하라는 等의 脫線的 注文, 모든 産業部門의 統制가 各 國策會社의 一社一業主義에 依하여 完全히 一元的으로 統制되고 있는 오늘에 있어서 『여보게 머- 利權하나 그곳에서 얻을 수 없는가』하는 類의 時代에 뒤진 妄說 等을 나는 種種拜聽하였다. 모도가 新體制의 앞잡이가 되고 있는 滿洲國의 實情을 모르는 때문이다.
朝鮮에서 鴨綠江과 豆滿江을 건너 滿洲國에 발을 드러 노을때에 느끼는 感은 實로 朝鮮과 滿洲國은 不可不離의 隣接關係라는 것을 切實히 느낄것이다. 滿洲國內의 汽車를 타거나 또는 農村의 어느 구석을 가거나 어데서나 朝鮮人의 그림자를 習見할 수 있다. 150萬이 이땅에 살고 있다는 事實이 무엇보담도 이 땅에서 親近한 感을 얻을 것이다. 汽車가 滿洲國境을 넘을 때 稅關檢査를 받게 되는 것 移動警察署의 査問을 받는 記憶만 사러진다면 滿鮮間의 往來는 異國間을 施行하였다는 意識조차 없는것이 大部分 在滿朝鮮人의 滿鮮一如感이다. 滿洲國의 國民服인 協和服은 단추가 『가꾸시보단』이고 朝鮮內의 國民服은 단추가 밖에 나오고 『띄』가 있다는 以外에는 生活新體制의 모든 部面도 別로 다를 것이 없는 大部分의 農民이 『쌀』을 파러서 『粟』을 먹으면서 節儉한 生活에 滿足하여 勤勤孜孜國策線에 直進하고 있는 點도 同一하다. 그러나 한가지 다른 것은 滿洲國內의 朝鮮人은 日本帝國의 忠良한 臣民인 同時에 東亞協同體의 據點인 民族協和의 道義國家인 滿洲國의 忠實한 先達的 國民으로서 使命까지를 다 할 二重의 精神的 義務가 있다. 그러나 朝鮮內 朝鮮人이나 滿洲國內 朝鮮人이나 曠古의 聖業인 東亞新秩序의 完成은 現在보담 朝鮮人의 生活을 一層 더 向上시키고, 希望과 幸福을＜51＞ 줄 것을 確信하고 있는 點에서는 全然 同一할 것이다. 이 希望과 幸福感에서 日本帝國의 威光下에서 現在의 非常時 新體制生活에 苦難을 堅忍克服하면서 前進하고 있는 것을 光輝로 생각하고 있다.

支那在住同胞의 書狀
上海と 同胞
上海居留朝鮮人民會長  李甲寧

上海には現在約八千の半島同胞が居住してゐる、今事變を契機として時間的に觀て驚異的な增加であり、資産程度も又驚く程のものである、そしてその生活程度は全滿支を通じて一番髙くあらう。勿論皮相的なもので內的に何等の充實さを有してゐない、寧ろ奢侈に過ぐるものがある、國際都市で國際人としての體面や、また見るもの聞くもの總てが物質文明の殊にアソリカズムの短所ばかりであるからの影響ではある、一體に海外に出てゐる同胞は とんでもない人世観を持つものが多い。非常にデカタンでリアリストで、極度なヱゴィストである、それも徹底してゐれぱよいが、そうでもない。御都合次第でどうでも身勝手なことを言ひ、或は行つてゐる、だから同胞間の團結だとか相助だとかの美風は見られない。全く心寂しい寒心な至りである。
今後支那に於て我等は意志と努力と誠意と進み方如何に依つては、一層發展すべく將來がある。
然し、現在の樣な狀態では、全然見邊なりと言つても過言ではあるまい。段々と國策の强化により各方面、殊に商工業方向には、より一層の强力な統制を施行することになつて見ると、我同胞は覺悟をきめ改さねばならない。今までの氣持ちと處世方ではこれ以上の發展を望めぬばかりか寧ろ近い將來に自滅せざるを得ない。
よく「支那(海外)にまで來て」云々言ふものがある、鮮內に居やうと支那に居やうと南極に居やうと朝鮮人(日本人)は朝鮮人であることに相違はない。＜52＞
朝鮮になれば如何なる場所に居でも同胞と共に生き、苦樂を共に分つのが本分である。
樂な時には身勝手なことをして指導者や他の同胞に迷惑を掛けつばなしにして置いて、困つた時たけ祖先を思ひ同胞に賴り國家に保護を求めるやうでは將來は暗黑である。實に困つたことである。
だけど一朝一夕に、このやうな民族的性格を改めさせることは不可能であることも萬々筆者も承知はしてゐる、然し、我等が今後海外に於て生活を推持し子孫萬代の緊榮を望むならばこの性格の缺陷を反省して根本的に改めることが現在我等に課せられた先決問題ではある、そして始めて我の進むべき、正規な進路も拓かれるのである。
この稿は筆者か常に心病してゐる一節であるが、新年を迎ふに當り誠心から同胞に忠言する所である。

日支事變第五新年을 迎하여
上海興亞院 華中連絡部 文化局  張在福

事變 第5新年을 마지하여 故國에 게신 同胞諸位의게 삼가 祝賀하오며 三千里紙上을 通하야 몇마디 새해의 所感을 쓰기로 함니다.
人類社會는 有史以來 멧번이나 變遷革新을 거듭하야 나려가는지 지나간 幾 천年歷史가 우리의 거울이 되여, 여러분도 다 잘 아시는 바입니다. 近世의 우리 東亞民族은 物質文明 즉 現代科學文明이 西洋諸國에 比하야 넘어나 떠러젓던 까닭에 今日과 같은 東亞에의 大事變을 培胎케 한 것이라고 볼 수 있습니다. 우리 東亞民族이 18世紀나 19世紀에 西洋人과 같은 海外發展에 着服되였다고 하였다면 었지 오늘날에 이르러 西洋人의 策動에 起因된 東亞民族의 悲劇인 大犧牲이 始作되였겠습니가. 그러나 歷史의 轉換期는 到來하고 말었스니 近代에 이르러 비로소 우리의 先覺者들이 느진 잠을 깨여 東亞는 東亞人을 내였고 東亞人을 위하야 있슴을 深深히 覺悟하게 되였습니다. 中國에서는 故 孫文先生, 汪精衛先生 等의 先見이 있었스니 곳 東亞를 직히는데는 東亞民族이 結合하여야라는 大亞細亞主義를 提唱하게 되였습니다. 그러나 大局을 멀니 보지 못하고 一部小部分의 地域的 挾見을 가진 抗日分子들을 東亞의 權益을 빼았길가 念慮하는 第3國의 策動과 함께 排日의 一團 蔣政權 形成하였스며 그리하야 事變을 이르킨지도 임이 第5年을 當하게 되였스나 如前抗戰을 繼續하니 이는 다만 自國을 焚土化할 뿐이요＜53＞ 何等의 有益없슴도 넉넉히 드러나지 많은 新秩序를 두러워 하는 第3國의 背後策動을 如前依賴하며 迷夢의 誤算인 時期到來만을 企待하고 있는 듯 함니다. 그러면 新秩序建設을 두러워하는 第3國은 어느 나라일고. 過去 18世紀 19世紀 以後 自由主義 資本主義의 英帝國이니 그동안 英國은 世界에 제패권을 가지고 地球上에 해지는 줄 모르고 大英帝國이라고 자랑할만치 列國을 침략하야 廣大한 類土를 獲得하야 둔 것임니닊�. 그러나 今日에 至하야는 그것을 保存하기 위하기 어러운 時代의 轉換期를 當面하게 되였스니 獨伊는 가지지 못한 國家이라 英帝國에 대하야 언제던지 繁榮을 獨占하도록 그대로 둘니는 萬無한 일이 안임니가. 그러하야 歐羅巴에서도 新秩序建設의 싸홈 卽 第2歐洲大戰이 이러나고 말었습니다. 미國은 大部分이 英國과 같은 「앙그로삭손」 種族인 만큼 人種的 同情과 또는 넓은 類土와 廣大 豊富한 資源을 가진 나라이니 新秩序建設은 自國에 不利함과 「앙그로삭손」種族의 將來의 危機름 豫想하고 英國에 加擔하야 如前英國과 一致한 行動을 取하며 蔣政權保助에도 未安한 손을 거두지 안습니다. 그러나 舊秩序의 主人公 老英帝國이 崩壞瀕死의 危機에 直面하였스며 帝國主義의 强壓에 신음하던 諸國은 新秩序建設에 呼應하는 고양이니 우리 新東亞共榮圈內 新秩序完成도 不遠한 將來이라 하겠습니다.
그러면 이같은 偉大聖業을 完成함에는 우리 앞에 말하기 어려운 百難이 밋처올 것을 몬저 覺悟하야 둘지니 物的으로 人的으로 더욱 그러하겠습니다. 그러나 우리는 如何한 波蘭이 밋처 오던지 가진 艱苦를 당하게 되던지 이 非常時期를 윀˜ 이겨 나아가야 겠습니다. 今日의 偉大함을 자랑하는 저 獨逸을 보십시요. 第1次大戰에 敗戰하던 當時 누구가 獨逸이 再起하야 오늘과 같은 偉力을 發輝할 줄 像想하였겠습니가. 其當時 獨逸은 外部로 國際的强壓이 있섰고 國內로는 民心이 四分五裂로 極度로 搖하여쓰되 當時 愛國家로 보인 「히틀러」는 忿然이 궐기하야 民心收拾에 全力을 다하는 一方 獨逸再建을 目標로 하야 「各同脫는 各自의 利益보다 協同體의 公利를 몬저 原則으로 하야 遵守하라」부르며 國民은 「히틀러」의 一擧一動에 合致하야 한덩이 技體가 된 거와 갖치 20餘年을 나려오며 戰時體制의 辛酸한 生活制度를 개념치안코 今日에 이른 것이 곳 歐羅巴에 君臨하는 大獨逸을 일운 것이 안임니가.
그러면 우리 東亞人의 自由와 東亞共榮圈內의 東亞民族의＜54＞ 繁榮을 目標로 未來의 運命을 決斷하는 乾坤一蹴의 此一戰은 이 事變을 處理하기까지에는 勿論 우리의 指導部 政府軍部에 信賴를 가지겠지요만은 國家內部로서는 第一로 精神的 團結이 必要한 것이며 工人은 공장에서 商人은 시장에서 農夫는 농장에서 科學者는 硏究室에서 言論機關에서는 筆端으로 學生은 學校에서 各各其天職을 따라 如何한 艱難이 밋처 오더래도 百折不屈하는 精神持久堅忍하야 大東亞共榮圈內에 新秩序建設함의 一員됨을 自覺하야 이에 功獻있기를 바라오며 마지막으로 同胞諸位의 健强을 비나니다.

上海와 朝鮮人
上海中華映畵會社 文藝部 姜鷺鄕

1, 새해가 온다기로서 별로 그 무슨 交歡의 말이라고 특별난 것이 생각나지 않습니다. 그저 自巳가 맡은 職務를 꾸준이 誠意있게 發展식혀 나가주기를 哀心으로 바라마지 않습니다. 요사이 더욱 더 크게 느껴지는 것은 우리 人生에 있이 「情熱」이란 것이 그 얼마나 貴重한 것인가를 마음속 깊이 깨닫고 있는 중입니다. 朝鮮內地에 게시는 여러분도 세월은 한해가 더 흘렀지만은, 당신이 가진 가슴속의 「情熱」만은 더욱 더욱 猛烈해 가고 젊어가고 아름다워가 주섰으면 합니다. 모-든 計劃과 出發은 그 뒤의 일이라고 생각합니다.
2, 나는 上海生活 都合 8年을 해온 사람이라고 해서 이러는게 아니라 事實 上海에 居住하는 朝鮮同胞의 生活을 잘 아는 사람 중의 하나라고 볼 수 있습니다. 그런만큼 在留同胞를 향해서(오직 在留同胞를 향해서) 하고 싶은 말도 너무나 만코 쓰고 싶은 것도 너무나 많습니다. 그렇나 내가 그것을 입으로 말하고 붓으로 쓴다기로서 그것을 귀담어 듣고 눈닉혀 볼 在留朝鮮동포가 몇사람 안되는 모양이라 차라리 黙黙不言 오직 나의 길만 精進하고 있는 중이니 더 말할 것 없으나 꼭 한마디 上海在留朝鮮人에게, 더욱이 指導層에 있다고 自處하고 있을 所謂 「上海産朝鮮名士」 諸君에게 드리는 말은 自巳自身을 反省해 보고 自巳批判해 볼 「생각」을 조금이라도 가저 보라는 것입니다.
그리고, 朝鮮內地에 게시는 여러분도 너무 上海, 上海! 하며 날뛰시지 마시고, 또 氣分的으로 漫然이 渡航하는 類의 大陸行은 絶對 삼가해 주시기 바랍니다. 이 반갑지＜55＞ 않는 漫然渡航 때문에 上海等地에서 버러지는 人生悲劇이 朝鮮人社會를 中心으로 그 얼마나 많으며 그 悲劇이 上海와 같은 國際都市의 한 모통이에 「클로-즈·엎」될 때 各方面에 던지는 그 아름답지 못한 印象이란 筆舌로 다 할 수 없는 지경입니다.
또 하나 말할 것은 이것은 특히 文化工作에 從事하고 게시는 분에게 드리는 意見입니다만은, 近來, 바람에 전해 오는 消息을 드르면 巷間에는 갑자기 「中國通」이 엄청나게 많어진 모양이며 딸아서 中國에 관한 書籍이 續出하는 것 같은데 日前 東京에 있는 某氏의 飜譯을 보면 中國原文 1萬字中 無慮 1,800餘字의 誤譯이 있었으니 그래도 이것을 「中國硏究의 一助가 될까하야...」云云하며 세상에 내놓는 그 强心臟에는 너무나 이처구니가 없었습니다.
이런 實例를 거울삼아 우리는 그 추하기 짝이 없는 妄擧를 서로 삼가 해 나갑시다. 事實, 한편의 中國文 飜譯, 한개의 中國論이 그리 쉽게 이루워지는 것이 아니라는 것은 너무나 잘아는 「常識」이 아닙니까.
끝으로 간흑 글월을 주신 未知의 兄弟諸氏에게도 여기 이 짧은 글노 답장을 대신하는 바이오니 恕諒하시옵소서.

東京大阪에서 보내는 글월
東京朝鮮人の現狀及發展
每日新報社 編輯局長 鄭寅翼

一、設問一へのお答へ
小生自身が、京城東京と、兩股掛けの境遇に於かれて居りますから、實は、東京在住人としての 掛聲は出來ない譯であります、然し折角の御設問に預り乍ら「いや立場が立場ですから 失禮します」とも 申し兼ねますので、思ひ付た事を、認める事にします。
大體朝鮮の皆樣は、內地その他朝鮮以外の地へ、移住して居る 朝鮮の同胞に對し、余りにも 無關心過ぎるのではないかと 思はれる點であります。勿論朝鮮を離れた同胞達の＜56＞朝鮮への心使ひも 賞めたものではないかに思ひますが、今は、小生朝鮮を離れた立場から 申上げる譯でありますから…
故鄕を離れて來て居るものゝ立埸から 申しますと、彼は彼、吾は吾と全然 赤の他人の如く 扱はれるのが如何に淋しく悲しき事か知らないのであります、勿論 一葦帶水の內地、朝鮮間の事でありますし、內地と言へど、同じ國內併も面倒を見て下れる、お上は、チヤンと控へて居る拋つて置いても甘く行かうではないかと 言はれることもありませうが、此れは人情の機微を 辨へない話であります、假りに卑近な例を上げて見まして、萬事皆樣が後見の心配を持たない程、順當であるにしても、或る慶弔相問し、或は節季の變り日のお見舞位有つて、然るべき事だと 思ひます、殊にそれよりも今一つ大きい事は、自分の身內のものを 他人樣の處へ居候させて、厄介になつて居るからにはその面倒を 見て下れる人達への感謝 若くは、お禮の挨拶位は、有るのが義理であり禮儀ではないかと 思ひます。
斯樣な心盡しは、例へ此處に來て居る朝鮮の同胞が、內地の皆樣へ 叱咜される 過ちを侵した埸合があるにしても、釋然とした、寬容の途も拓けるであらうし將又、和かなる將來も、期し得るのではないかと思ひます。
又、內地へ來て、公私何れにしても甚だ實直に、誠勤に働く人が、多いのでありますが、中にも 內地の皆樣へ、物心兩面から 少らず厄介になつて居る 人等の爲め、種々と社會施設的仕事をして居られる方が 少くない樣であります、勿論裸一貫で以つて、血が滲れ樣な奮鬪を續けつゝ此の尊敬すべき仕事を 營爲して居のでありますが、未甞て朝鮮內の有志の方から 人情ある御聲援に預つたと言ふ事を 聞かないのが何よりも殘念の至りであります。
返つて內地の皆樣が、當然なる義務の如く、二重三重、斯云ふ仕事に、物心兩方から 眞情をこめた聲援を されるのであります、實に慚愧に堪へない處であります、そうして動鞭もすれば、半島の人お互に義理人情がないのは 如何なる譯かと聞かされる場合がありますが、實に申譯ない事であります。
斯樣な不名譽を取り返すには、現在內地へ、居を構へて居る 半島人の自覺も勿論必要なものでありますが、より 切實なるものは、朝鮮內の皆樣が、內地へ移住して居な朝鮮同胞への關心であり、扶助の情誼であります、自分の身內のものを 人樣へ厄介かけて置いて 見ず知らずの態度をするのは如何に引■目に見ても 賞めた事ではありません、之れは＜57＞決して物質的なお願ひばかりではありません、先つ心から皆が皆斯樣な氣持になりますれば、自ら應分な方策が 湧いて來るものと思ひます、或は「心はあつても力がないから」と言はれる方も居られませうが、之れは その心構から 旣に「不爲非不能」の方でせう。
慶しき佳年の始めに、つまらない苦言を 申述べる事は、交歡の意に反する樣にも 思はれますが、口先のお祝ひ言葉だけで、實際に於てはお互苦虫を嚙み潰した樣な 顔をするよりは苦言の交換に依つて、此の一年間、實際に於ける歡びを頒つのが 返つて交顔の極致かと 思ひまして、敢へて一言呈上する次第であります。

二、設問二へのお答
內地に來て居る 朝鮮同胞の現狀は、一言に耍約しまして生延びんとする 力に充ち滿ちて居る事です「先づ我等は、生活の方途を樹ててそれが 安堵の域へ達した時、始めて他の事への 心の餘裕を持たう」と言ふのが、恐らく大抵の人の氣持ではないかと 思ひます、それが爲め 彼等は 我武者らに、生計のコースをのみ驅けて居る樣であります、斯樣な狀態でありますから、自然貴問の如き、教育、產業、經濟文化等の部門に亘つて「あゝ有りますとも」と言つた調子にお示し出來る ■つたものはない樣であります、勿論個人くの場合、大分人を羡ませる成功者も ないことはないですが、之れは 極少數の個人に限られた事でありまして、在住朝鮮人全體を論ずる場合 何等の力にもならない 誇りにもならない 微々たるものでありませう。
要するに、敎育も產業も經濟も、將又文化も、集團された力の中から 創生されて、それが その集團全般への共通性を持ち延いては他との聯關性を持つ樣になつて來なければならないと思ひますが、今迄の內地在住朝鮮人の境遇がそんな事に用意を持つ丈の 餘裕がなかつたのでありますし、然も朝鮮人總體的獨自の、產業振作も、文化建設も、必要としなかつた關係ではないでせうか、實際に於て 朝鮮人の爲めの……標語の下に、健實に營爲されたものは 古今を通じて殆んど皆無に申して過言でない有樣であります。
唯皆が皆、各自の立場に於て、自己生活を護り通し、生活の落伍者にならないとする丈の 努力を積んで來たのであります、從つて玆に述ベました如く、一、二の個人的成功者も時には顯れて來て居りますし、又一般の生活水準も、多少は向上して來て居る樣に 見受けられます。
以上の如き狀態でありますが、併し百萬と呼ばれる 內地＜58＞在住の朝鮮人の八割以上が、未尙、誇るべき生活圈にまて達して居ませんから、喰ふ事に囚れ勝ちな人共に、組織ある體系立つた 敎育も產業も經濟も文化も、考ふる餘裕がある筈がありません。
併し一面、心强く思はれますものは、最近、之等の同胞が何年前かの如き、徒らなる 心の荒びからスツカリ立ち上り落着き拂つた態度で、一心不亂、生活と鬪ひ抜く 眞面目さを、歷然と見せて來た點であります、要するに、定軌の上に乘つた車輪の如く、今度こそ 脫線する事なしに、軌道を、上手に走れば、何れ酬いられて 期する到着點へ 達し得るものと思はれます、今は、唯その時の、一日も早く來らん事を誰しもが望むものでありますが、之れとても 獨りの力では 期し難き事であります。
今後、內地在住朝鮮出身者の 發展向上は、勿論本人等自らの努力が 絕對的でありますが、內鮮當局の心盡しと、將又朝鮮の皆樣の協力が加はつて始めて 成果を得るものと思ひます。

御書翰有難く拜誦仕り候、尙電報迄御打電の御樣子恐縮に存じ候(電報は學校の給仕が紛失したる由つて末だ電文に接せざれど電文の內容を質したる所『論文早く送れ』といふ意味であつた由貴社よりの電報と推索致し居候、御書面に依れば、今度貴社に於て、海外同胞の事情を御紹介なされる、御豫定との事誠に有意義なる事と存候、それに就て小生に何か原稿をと御命令に接したるも、小生數日間旅行して歸京したるのが、先月二十九日にて、三十日の締切迄には到底間に合はぬものと斷念致し居り候處、昨日又電報が來たる由承り候へとも學期末の試驗やら年暮の事やらで、多少急がしい時間を送りおり候故、落着いた原稿も急には書けず切角の御計劃に對して、小生の誠意の足らざるが如き、不眞面目なる急作の稿も送られず、甚だ貴社に對して、相濟まぬことに、御座候へとも、又この次に機會之有候へば、其時は充分なる用意のもとに、書き送り度く存じ候間、不惡御諒承相成度に此段＜59＞願申上候。
何か簡單にでもとの御命令なるも、送舊迎新の感想だとて吾々に取つては、彼我何等變るべき所あるべき筈なく、文字通の空前未曾有の世界史轉換の際に當り、何等の役割をも果し得なく、朝鮮人か何をか口を開けて云はんやいふのか、自分の忌憚なき、感想にて御座候。我々も最少し、世界情局に目を向けて、現實を直視し己れの無力さより、最少し實感自覺し發奮昻起して實力を培養する以外何ものもないものと信じ居候。
東京在住同胞の狀況に就ては、小生寡問にして全般に通じてよく、存ぜざれと日常接觸している朝鮮學生に就ては、聊か感じる所あり、又考へる所之有候へとも、これ簡單には申上難ねることにて 殘念に存候、然し日常考へる一端としては、東京に遊學している 一萬五千餘の朝鮮學生の父兄方々は 單に子弟を 東京へ遺り請求通りの 金額を送つて、後は彼等が如何なる生活をし、如何なる勉强をしているかを、全然知らぬでいるが如き 今日の狀態を父兄達は、自ら進んで、具體策を講じ改善して行くべきではないかと いふ事にて御座候。
一萬五千餘の朝鮮學生大部分の生活が如何なるものであるかは貴下に於てもよく御存じの事と推察致し居り候、この今日の現狀を放任しておくといふ事は、東京に彼等の先輩がゐないといふ事も、一つの大きな原因に御座候へとも、一つは父兄達があまりにも 無關心といふよりは、子弟の敎導方針といふ事に就てより眞に考へておられないかとい事には御座らぬかと常に考へ居候、御社に於ても 機會あらば、鄕里におられる父兄方の關心を呼起し子弟敎育の爲め最少し眞劍たれといふ事を御傳へ被下度敎職に居る小生として切に御願申上る次第にて御座候。
御命令にも從はず、御願のみを申上るのは、甚だ無禮なる態度にて御座候へとも、事情文頭に於て申上たる通りにて御座候らへば何卒御諒承被下度。
亂事を以て、御詫び傍々御願迄如仍御座候。敬具

大阪居住朝鮮同胞現狀
大阪東一株式會社重役 朴永壽

새해를 마즈면서 交歡의 뜻으로 朝鮮人의 現狀과 發展策에 대하여 寄稿의 依託을 받고 「펜」을 아니 들 수 없게 되였으나 手中에 統計表가 없으며 平時 이러한 問題에 대한 誠意가 充分치 못함으로 忠實한 報告를 올니지 못함은 遺憾히 生覺하며 簡單히 現狀報告에 끝이려 한다.
大阪府下에는 朝鮮同胞가 約31萬이 居住하며 各種 産業部門에 相當한 活躍을 하고 있다. 滿洲事變을 契機로 軍需景氣의 餘派에서 昨年 (昭和15年) 봄까지, 失業者도 없었으며 그 중에는 多少 餘裕있는 분은 中小工場들도 建築하여서 3, 40萬 乃至 數萬圓 以上의 致富者도 現出되여 飛躍的 發展을 하였다. 그러나 一般的으로 볼때 經濟的 水準이 나즈며 旣往에는 自由經濟의 觀念下에서 發展되여 왔음으로 昨今 統制經濟의 急旋風이 닥치자 急激히 事業을 擴張식혀 놓은만큼 世波에 따라 타격을 받는 分도 없지 않은 模樣이다. 그러나 그분들의 多大數는 赤手空拳으로 玄海灘을 건너 와 惡戰苦鬪한 勇士들인 만큼 그리 前途을 悲觀한 것이 아니며 一時의 苦痛은 不免할지라도 이러한 體驗을 通하여 礎基가 더욱 堅實해지며 計劃的 企業에 認識을 밝히리라고 볼 수가 있다.
그리고 大阪居住 同胞의 學齡兒童은 全部 義務敎育을 받게 됨으로 小學校에도 모다 就學됨으로 兒童敎育에는 困難이 없다. 大略 그 數字을 든다면 小學生 15,000餘名 中 等學校生徒 800餘名 專門學校 以上 學生 250餘名이다. 우리들이 第一 期待하는 것은 그들의 成長이며 將來에 中堅靑年이 되여 社會의 役軍으로서는 모든 方面에 進出하여 좀 더 秩序있게 生活을 해나가게 되면 不遠間 經濟的 水準과 一般的 대우가 改善되리라고 推測된다.
그보담 大阪이라면 産業都市인만큼 이곳 同胞의 職業은 職工과 自由勞働者가 大多數이나 他面 東洋唯一의 商工都市임으로 各其 職場에서 商才을 길울 수 있으며 技術 等을 體得할 수 있음으로 將次 實質的으로 이 地方을 위하여 努力할 것은 勿論이겠지만 今後에는 鮮滿地方으로도 進出하여 各部門에 重要한 役割을 擔當하리라고 믿는다.

朝鮮文化の基本姿勢
東京「婦人畵報」 記者 金鍾漢

一, *中欠體
二、昨今のやうに、文學は文化に、文化は政治に移行した時代＜61＞には仕方なくほめられる文學、といふものが出てくる。批評氏は意識しながら(逃げたがら)ほめてをくことにする。ほめられて、氣持が惡い。
事變以來、日增しに昻りつゝある內地の文壇に於ける朝鮮文學への關心も丁度そのやうなものであらう。文化百年之計とは思はれない。ジヤアナリズムが發作的に李光洙や古丁等を宣傳してみたところで、嚴肅な文化財の蓄積に何を寄與しうるといふのであらう。だが、時代が、それを要求してゐるとすれば、仕方もないことだらう。今は、さういふ時代であるのだ。そして、恐らくそれでよいのだらう。
ただこの場合、私たちが忘れてはならないことは、これが過渡期であるといふことだ。つまり昨今、東京を中心にして行はれつゝある文化の中央集權的な動向は、單なる明日の文化への準備運動に過ぎないといふことである。
この、中央集權的な、新しい文化の準備運動が終つたら、順序として必ず、地方分權的な文化の萌芽する時代がくるであらうと、私は考へてゐる。つまり、朝鮮には朝鮮らしい、滿洲には滿洲らしい文化が、新體制のサアチライトの中に、自な使命と位置を發見して、新しい自律獨への
姿勢をとらねばたらぬ日がくると思つてゐる。
〇
たとへば、日本の短篇は海外のそれと比べて決して劣つてゐないと菊池寬が喝破した場合、ぢや日本文學をフランスに輸出する勇氣がありますかと反問したいのだ。つまり、日本文學がつまらないのではなく、日本文學を輸出せねばならぬほどフランス文學が貧しくないのだ。それだけの話である。同樣なことが、朝鮮文學の場合にも云へると思つてゐる。
つまり、朝鮮文學を輸入せねばならぬほど、內地の文壇は貧しくはないのだ。だから朝鮮文學選集の內地での賣行が惡いからとて、それが朝鮮の作家の不名譽にはならないわけである。それだけの話である。
そも〱、作品の對外的價値といふものには、作品自體の價値の外にいろ〱な附帶的條件が必要であるらしい。せめて內地に紹介するなら朴泰遠の川邊風景と李光洙の無明くらゐなものであるといふのが、私の意見なのだが、これらの作品が必ずしも、金南天の大河や、李箕永の故鄕よりも優れてゐるといふ理由からではないのだ。
短篇の場合にも、同じやうなことが云へるので、飜譯してをかしくなかつた作品は俞鎭午、李孝石の作品くらゐなもの＜62＞であつたと記憶してゐる、金素雲の乳色の雲にしたつて、三十五歲以下の內地の若者は、まあく讀まなかつただらう。
〇
さうだ、私ははつきりと結論してをかう。時勢や、ジヤアナリズムの波に押されて、二三人の作家が內地の文壇に浮き上つたつて、仕方がないぢやないかと。私のやうな無才な者にも、詩集の出版をすすめる芥川賞選者級の先輩なら、一二人はゐないこともないが、內地の文壇に於ける張赫宙や金史良などの悲慘な行狀を見てゐるのだから、つひ勇氣が出ないのだ。それだけの話である。
〇
久しりぶに社用で、歸鮮したら、一部の朝鮮の作家たちが No more-Oh never more! みたいな表情をしてゐるのに接して悲しかつた。
もしばらくしたら、朝鮮文化の自律すべき、基本姿勢みたいなものも、明らかにされる日がくるだらう。そして新しい文化への希望と信賴とが生れるだらう。
(その時には、小生も歸鮮するつもりである、安ツぼい雜誌記者を長くやつてゐると人間が惡くなりさうだから、京城に歸つたら燒鳥屋でも開業して、詩を書くつもりである。)

理想は高く現實は正確に
東京同盟通信社 邊成烈

拜啓、電報を受けてから四日目の今日、初めて葉書と封書を戴きました。電報を受けたときは一寸見當が附きませんでしたが今日初めて、はつきりしました、封書は電報通信と宛名を書きましたので、封書の表に符箋が三四枚附けて今屆きました。順序不同とは申しながらも、有名の社長及重役が、つらつと右に並べてゐるので、柄々にあはぬ小生は遠慮させて戴きます、締切も旣に過ぎだ今日書いても無駄だらうし、それに小生、目下英文單行本を年內に出版す可く執筆中で、多忙に紛れ失禮させて戴きますから不惡御願ひします。交歡の言葉も旣に他處へ書きましたので書き盡しました。强いて書けと申せば「理想は高く現實は正確に」とても申しませう。

武漢と朝鮮人
漢口和平日語學校長 柳相垠

聖戰第五ケ星霜の新春を、支那四百餘州の心臓部たる、武漢三鎭に於て御迎へ、聖壽無疆を御祈り奉ることは誠に、慶＜63＞賀に堪えざる次第であります。昭和十三年十月二十七曰、皇軍が武漢入城以來二個年有餘、武漢三鎭の人口、百萬を突破し、邦人の人口丈一萬を超過し、全く理想的平和境となつたのであります。現在の武漢の民衆は戰塵を忘れ平和に眠り、建設に醒めて居るのであります。今や日支一家一心同德の實を上げつゞあるのであります。
在留半島同胞も非常に經濟的に惠まれ、一人平均一千圓以上の資金を有するとの事であります。支那人の生活狀態も滿洲、北支等に比すれば遙かに富裕であります。
此れ即ち、江南地方たる揚子江流域の物資豐富を物語る所以であります。尙漢口は昔から九省の會と云ひ、支那本部十八省の內、九省の物資を吞吐する四通五達、貿易中心地でありまして、今後京漢鐵道開通と相待つて、我が同胞の活躍の樂天地となることは、火る見るより明かと思料致します。意義の深い二千六百一年新春の元旦に、前線に於ける皇軍將士竝戰歿英靈に感謝の默禱と武運長久を御祈り、銃後國內の皆樣の御建康を御祈り申上げます。＜64＞

上海의 猶太人과 朝鮮人
上海時報社 副社長 金璟載

새해를 당하니 안에 게신 형제의 多福을 비는 마음이 간절하외다.
나는 1年半이나 上海에 와서 밥버리에 분주하게 지내갑니다. 上海式 語套로 新上海인 내가 上海消息 전한다는 것은 주제 넘은 일이외다.
통칭 7,000이라고 하나 나는 4천 5,6명의 同胞가 上海에 居住한다고 봅니다. 그들에게 正當한 職業을 주지 않으면 一大問題이겠읍니다. 不名譽스러운 不正業者의 冠詞를 때여 내이려면 우리도 反省해야 합니다. 이 점은 上海만이 그러함이 아니요 南京 漢口 等地에 사시는 우리에게 共通된 問題입니다.
猶太人이 獨逸에서 쫓기여서 上海에 온것이 不過 2年이건만 그들은 楊樹浦를 根據로 하고 繁華한 市街를 建設했읍니다. 우리가 猶太人을 모방하라는 것은 絶對로 아니나 우리가 사는 虯(규)江路하고 對照할때에 天壤의 차가 있읍니다.
勤勉하고 배우고 健實한 職業을 갖고 生活의 安定을 第一段의 目標로 하고 크게 反省하고 努力할 必要가 있읍니다.
이 점은 밖에서 사는 우리가 꾸준히 努力하여야겠고 안에 계시는 兄弟도 聲授하고 鞭撻해 주서야 하겠읍니다.
＜48-64＞
