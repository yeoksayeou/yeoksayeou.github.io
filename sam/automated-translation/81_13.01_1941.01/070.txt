Interview with the New Grand Academician, Mr. Pak Sangjun
						By Reporter P

Mr. Pak is the Grand Academician of the Kyŏnghagwŏn, an Advisor to the Central Council, and President of Myŏngnyun Specialized Academy.

Who would succeed the late Viscount Yun Tŏgyŏng, the former Grand Academician (大提學) of the Kyŏnghagwŏn (經學院), had been a topic of considerable curiosity among the public. As the Kyŏnghagwŏn is under the direct control of the Government-General (總督府), the Government-General had been carefully selecting the successor. Following the final decision by Governor-General Minami (南總督), Mr. Pak Sangjun (朴相駿) (Japanese name: Pak T'aek Sangjun 朴澤相駿), currently serving as an Advisor (參議) to the Central Council (中樞院), has been appointed as the new Grand Academician. Consequently, he also concurrently holds the position of President (總裁) of the Myŏngnyun Specialized Academy (明倫專門學院). Considering Mr. Pak's significant contributions to the promotion of Korean Confucianism (朝鮮儒道振興), his appointment is deemed appropriate.

Mr. Pak, originally from Ŭnsan-ri, Ŭnsan-myŏn, Sunch'ŏn-gun, P'yŏngan-namdo, despite his advanced age of 65, lives by the motto "Action First" (實行 第一主義), always displaying passion and an active spirit. Furthermore, possessing both profound learning and virtue (學德), and having shown talent in statecraft (經世之才) since his youth, he is a figure worthy of public esteem (屬望). This is likely because Mr. Pak not only specialized in Chinese Classics (漢學) from a young age, becoming well-versed in the scriptures (經典) and putting the Way of Confucius and Mencius (孔孟之道) into practice, but also diligently pursued the study of new knowledge (新知識), enabling him to achieve great success today. <83>

Looking back at Mr. Pak's past, he resigned from a position in the Communications Bureau (遞信官署) in Meiji 38 (1905) and devoted himself entirely to the educational development of youth. Later, he re-entered government service, serving as the county magistrate (郡守) of Kangdong-gun in P'yŏngan-namdo, followed by stints as magistrate of Sunch'ŏn-gun and P'yŏngwŏn-gun. From Taishō 15 (1926) to Shōwa 4 (1929), he served successively as Governor (知事) of Kangwŏn-do, Hamgyŏng-pukto, and Hwanghae-do. Since December of Shōwa 4 (1929), he has served as an Advisor to the Central Council. During this time, in May of Shōwa 13 (1938), he assumed the roles of Lecturer (講士) at the Kyŏnghagwŏn and Councilor (評議員) at the Myŏngnyun Specialized Academy, contributing efforts to the promotion of Korean Confucianism (朝鮮儒道 振興). He also played a significant role in the formation of the Confucian Association (儒道 聯合會).

It was nine o'clock on the morning of December 1st, the day the first snow fell in Kyŏngsŏng (京城), when this reporter knocked on the gate of the Kyŏnghagwŏn to visit the new Grand Academician, Pak Sangjun.

After getting off the streetcar at Myŏngnyun-dong (明倫町) and walking under the heavily overcast, snowy sky into the grounds of the Kyŏnghagwŏn, the ancient trees and old pines in the spacious garden (苑內), covered in snow, looked even more venerable (古色). Beneath the wall, commemorative trees planted by Governor-General Minami (南總督), Army Commander Nakamura (中村軍司令官), Administrative Superintendent Ōno (大野政務總監), and others stood capped with white snow.

Upon entering the office (事務室), I found that a fragrant incense ceremony (芬香式) led by Grand Academician Pak, attended by various dignitaries (諸識) and academy students (學院生), was taking place in a separate lecture hall (講堂), so I had no choice but to wait. The building was in the old palace style (古宮式), and the modern artifacts like tables (테불) and stoves (스토브) placed in the gloomy interior somehow seemed out of place.

Shortly thereafter, I met Grand Academician Pak and offered congratulations on his new appointment. He responded, "My appointment is an overwhelming honor for me personally, but for the Confucian community (儒林), I wonder if having someone as shallow (淺薄) as myself receive the appointment as successor might actually be unfortunate. However, having ascended to this position beyond my station, I intend to embody the intentions of the successive Grand Academicians and, receiving guidance from all related parties, dedicate myself wholeheartedly (粉骨碎身) with sincerity, striving and endeavoring in the mission entrusted to me."

Thus, Mr. Pak showed both an attitude of utter humility and the spirit to devote himself passionately to his mission.

Mr. Pak continued,

"The Kyŏnghagwŏn is the foremost center (首善之地) of the Confucian community in Chōsen (朝鮮). Accordingly, the influence of Confucian teachings (儒敎의 敎化) was significant not only before the Old Korean Empire period but also from that time <84> up to the present. The Kyŏnghagwŏn, as the headquarters (本山) of the Confucian community, has made great contributions to guiding the public mind (民心의 善導) and cultivating character (人格陶冶). In this, the achievements of the successive Grand Academicians are also great. Furthermore, the late Viscount Yun Tŏgyŏng (尹德榮子爵閣下), the former Grand Academician, was highly respected for his virtue and reputation (德望), and his efforts toward the advancement of the Academy's affairs (院務) and the promotion of Confucianism (儒道의 振興) were substantial. I believe his accomplishments (治積) can truly serve as a model for people today and will shine brilliantly for posterity."

As time seemed quite pressing, the reporter avoided asking further lengthy questions and inquired about Mr. Pak's philosophy of life and his plans (經綸) for the Kyŏnghagwŏn.

"Having just taken office, I am still a blank slate (白紙) regarding the affairs of the Kyŏnghagwŏn. Therefore, I currently have no specific plans or aspirations (抱負) to speak of. As I become familiar with the work, my principle is to establish concrete ideals for the development of the Kyŏnghagwŏn and put them into practice (實行). As for my philosophy of life (人生觀), there is nothing particularly special. Firstly, it is essential to manifest the fundamental spirit of self-cultivation and governing others (修己治人), thereby making the Way (道), virtue (德), and all other ethical principles part of daily life, meaning practicing them personally (實踐躬行). A person of action rather than words – this is the kind of person our society seeks today.

Secondly, to thoroughly cultivate morality (道義培養) with the central goal of improving the quality of the people (國民資質) and thereby strive for the promotion of Confucianism (儒道振興). Thirdly, regarding the points where traditional Chinese Confucianism (支那의 儒學) was imported without proper digestion (咀嚼), I hope for thorough research by experts to innovate (刷新). Fourthly, as Imperial Subjects (皇國臣民), our Confucian community (儒林), considering why we are called the head of the four classes (士農工商 - scholar, farmer, artisan, merchant - 四民의 首), must unite and cooperate (一致協力) in this time of national crisis (國家多事) to achieve the actual practice of the Way of the Subject (臣道實踐). These would be my aspirations for the Kyŏnghagwŏn, if you can call them aspirations; my ideals, if you can call them ideals; and my philosophy of life, if you can call it that."

Expressing my gratitude, I exited the main gate of the Kyŏnghagwŏn. The snow was still falling softly. (End) <85>

**Summary**

This 1941 article reports on the appointment of Pak Sangjun as the new Grand Academician of the Kyŏnghagwŏn (the central institution for Confucianism under the Japanese Government-General) and President of Myŏngnyun Specialized Academy, succeeding the late Viscount Yun Tŏgyŏng. The reporter interviews Pak, detailing his background as a former official (including provincial governor) and Confucian scholar, emphasizing his dedication to action, humility, and commitment to Confucian principles. Pak outlines his vision for the Kyŏnghagwŏn: promoting morality, adapting Confucianism, and crucially, mobilizing the Confucian community (as "Imperial Subjects") to actively support the Japanese Empire ("practice the Way of the Subject") during a time of "national crisis" (likely referring to the ongoing Sino-Japanese War/WWII). The article presents Pak's appointment as appropriate due to his past contributions and aligns his goals with the colonial administration's objectives.

For historians, the article is revealing as it showcases the perspective of a high-ranking Korean collaborator within the colonial system in 1941. Pak Sangjun's explicit linkage of Confucianism ("the head of the four classes") with loyalty to the Japanese Empire ("Imperial Subjects," "Way of the Subject," "national crisis") demonstrates how traditional institutions and ideologies were being co-opted and reinterpreted to serve Japanese imperial aims during wartime mobilization. His emphasis on "action" over words and adapting Confucianism also reflects the pragmatic demands placed on colonial subjects by the administration.

新大提學 朴相駿氏 訪問記
						P記者
氏는 經學院大提學, 中樞院參議, 明倫專門學院總裁
經學院의 前 大提學 故 尹德榮 子爵의 後任으로 누가 登場하게 되느냐에 대해서는 그間 市井人士의 한 궁금한 話題꺼리었었는데, 經學院이 總督府의 直屬이니만치 總督府에서는 그 後任人選을 愼重히 하여 오던 中, 南總督의 最後의 決裁를 받아 現 中秋院參議로 계신 朴相駿(創氏名 朴澤相駿)씨가 新 大提學으로 推戴를 받게 되었고, 따라서 明倫專門學院의 總裁까지 兼任하게 되었다. 이 人選에 있어서, 朝鮮儒道振興에 적지 않은 功勞를 끼친 氏가 推戴케 된 것은 適當한 人選이라 하겠다.
氏는 本來 平安南道 順川郡 殷山面 殷山里 出生으로 當年 165歲의 高齡에 있음에도 不拘하고, 實行 第一主義를 生活의 標語로 언제나 熱誠과 아울러 活動的인 氣慨를 보여주며, 따라서 學德이 兼有圓熱하고, 經世之才를 젊은 時節부터 가져, 可히 世人의 屬望을 받기에 넉넉한 人物인 것이다. 이는, 氏가 幼少時부터 漢學을 專攻하여 經典에 밝을 뿐 아니라 孔孟之道를 實踐에 옮기었으며, 따라서 新知識의 硏讚에 努力했음이 氏로 하여금 今日의 大成을 보게 한 것이리라. ＜83＞
이제 氏의 뒷날을 一瞥하면, 氏는 明治38年에 遞信官署의 職을 辭하고, 專혀 靑年의 敎育 事業에 獻身的 努力을 하여오다가, 그 後 官界에 다시 投身하여 平南 江東 郡守를 지냈으며, 다시 順天郡守와 平原郡守를 經하였고, 大正15년부터 昭和4년까지는 江原道 知事, 咸鏡北道知事, 黃海道知事를 歷任하였던 것이다. 그리고, 昭和4년 12월부터 中樞院 參議로 今日에 至하였으며, 그間 昭和13년5월에 經學院 講士와 明倫專門學院 評議員에 就任하여 朝鮮儒道 振興에 힘을 기우렸고, 儒道 聯合會의 結成에도 功勞가 多大하였었다.
記者가 新 大提學 朴相駿氏를 찾아 經學院의 門을 두다리기는 京城에 첫눈이 나리던 12月 初하룻날 아침 아홉時였다.
明倫町에서 電車를 버리고, 무겁게 흐린, 눈 나리는 하늘 밑을 걸어 經學院 뜰에 들어서니, 넓은 苑內의 古木과 老松은 눈을 받아, 더 한層 古色이 지터 보인다. 담장 밑으로는 南總督, 中村軍司令官, 大野政務總監 等 諸氏의 記念 植樹가 힌 눈을 이고 있다.
事務室에 들어서니, 때마침 別室 講堂에서 朴大提學의 引導下에 諸識 一同과 學院生 一同의 芬香式이 있어서, 기다리는 수밖에 없었다. 建物은 옛날 古宮式인데다가 그 우중충한 室內에 테불과 스토브 等 現代文明의 加工品이 놓여 있는 것이 어쩐지 잘 어울리지 않는다.
이윽고 朴大提學을 만나 新任의 人事를 드리니 『今番 내가 就任케 된 것은 나 一身에 있어서는 넘치는 光榮이나, 儒林을 위해서는 나 같은 淺薄한 人物이 後任의 拜命을 받었다는 것이 오히려 不幸이 아닐까 생각합니다. 그러나 分에 넘는 이 자리에 오른 以上 歷代 大提學의 뜻을 體하고 및 關係 各位의 指導를 받아, 내 誠意것 粉骨碎身, 나에게 맡겨진 使命에 奮鬪努力하렵니다.』
하고, 氏는 어디까지나 謙遜한 態度와 함께 自己의 使命에 熱誠을 다할 意氣를 보여주고 있다.
氏는 다시 말을 이어,
『經學院은 朝鮮에 있는 儒林의 首善之地요, 따라서, 儒敎의 敎化는 舊韓國時代以前은 勿論, 그 以後부터＜84＞ 現在에 이르기까지 컸었고, 經學院은 儒林의 本山으로 民心의 善導와 人格陶冶에 多大한 貢獻을 끼쳐왔으며, 이에 있어 歷代 大提學의 功績도 또한 偉大한 것입니다. 그리고 前 大提學이시던 故 尹德榮子爵閣下도 德望이 높고 院務의 進展과 儒道의 振興에 努力함이 커서 그 治積은 可히 世人의 本이 될 것이오 및 後世에 燦然히 빛날 것이라 믿습니다.』
時間이 大端히 총망한 모양이어서 記者는 더 긴말을 묻기를 避하고, 氏의 人生觀과 經學院에 대한 氏의 經綸을 물었다.
『아직 就任한지 얼마 되지 않아서 經學院 院務에 대해선 白紙외다. 그러니 지금 具體的인 무슨 經綸, 抱負랄 것이 없고, 일이 손에 익는대로 經學院의 發展에 具體的인 理想을 세우고 및 實行에 옮길 主義외다. 그리고 내 人生觀이란 別것이 있을 것이 없고, 單只 修己治人의 根本精神을 發揮하여 써 道와 德과 그外 온갖 倫理的인 것을 生活化 즉 實踐躬行해야 할 것이 그 첫째외다. 말보다 行의 人, 이것이 오늘의 우리 社會가 찾는 人物이라고 생각합니다.
둘째로 國民資質의 向上을 中心目標로 하는 道義培養을 徹底시켜 儒道振興을 꾀할 것, 셋째로 從來 支那의 儒學을 그대로 輸入하여 咀嚼치 못한 點은 大家의 硏究를 바라서 刷新해 갈 것, 넷째로 皇國臣民으로서의 우리 儒林은 所謂 四民의 首(士農工商)라고 일컸는 所以를 생각하여 國家多事의 秋에 一致協力 臣道實踐의 實을 걷울 것, 이것이 즉 經學院에 대한 내 抱負라면 抱負고, 理想이라면 理想이고, 내 人生觀이라면 人生觀일 것이외다.』
感謝의 뜻을 表하고, 經學院의 正門을 나선 때에도 눈은 亦是 부실부실 나리고 있었다.(끝)＜85＞
＜83-85＞
