**A Respectful Record of Deep Emotion Before Nijūbashi Bridge: Memoirs of Various Persons Attending the 2600th Year Ceremony**

*Baron Yi Hang-gu (李恒九), Chamberlain of the Yi Royal Household Office*

**Attending the Kigen 2600 Ceremony**

The long-awaited Kigen 2600 (Imperial Year 2600) arrived at the start of the year. And I heard the celebratory ceremony would be held in the autumn. From the time I heard this, I rejoiced and waited, thinking I could bask in the Imperial benevolence (皇恩), an opportunity that comes once in a thousand years. Various events were held one after another in many places, further deepening the significance for the entire nation and filling everyone with deep emotion.
Finally, November 10th and 11th drew near. Facing this unprecedented ceremony under the new order (新體制), an event difficult to encounter again, I calmed my heart and, from the bottom of my soul, focused solely on the infinity of the Imperial benevolence and the prosperity of the nation's fortune (國運). Filled with deep emotion by the vast and boundless Imperial benevolence, I attended the ceremony.
The weather, which had been generally concerning until the night of the 9th, cleared up completely from the early morning of the 10th, without a single cloud, and the ceremony began.
It was conducted most solemnly under the presence of Their Majesties the Emperor and Empress (天皇皇后兩陛下). Being not far from Their Majesties, I continuously beheld the Imperial countenance (天顔) and could not help but shed tears at the immense blessing of being an Imperial subject (皇國臣民).
The following day, the 11th, the weather was clear just like the previous day. Witnessing firsthand the tangible divine protection, I keenly felt the blessing and realized profoundly that this truly is the divine land (神國) <78> of Japan, the land of the gods. The Celebration Gathering (奉祝會) on this day was held from the afternoon. Awed, just as on the previous day, we looked up to the presence of Their Majesties, and it was held ever more grandly, with each of the fifty-some-thousand attendees receiving Imperial refreshments (饌). This deep emotion is truly difficult to fully express in words or writing.
Both days were strangely—no, not strangely, this must surely be divine protection—clear weather. The gathering of tense subjects, truly a sight unthinkable and unimaginable if not in the Great Japanese Empire. And I felt anew that this was a gathering of strength more than sufficient to shoulder the burden of Imperial Japan. I was moved to tears, keenly feeling the vast and boundless Imperial benevolence and the blessing of being born an Imperial subject in this sacred era, in today's Great Japanese Empire. I simply pray for the eternity of the Sacred Reign (聖壽), the prosperity of the nation's fortune, and the promotion of national prestige (國威), remaining deeply moved.

*Ch'oe Rin (崔麟), President of the Mainichi Shinpo (每日新報)*

**Joining the Fifty-Five Thousand Subjects**

As one among the fifty-five thousand common subjects (民草) who obtained the honor of attending from not only the mainland (內地), but also Korea (朝鮮), Taiwan (臺灣), Karafuto (樺太), and furthermore, from Manchukuo (滿洲國) and our friendly neighbor China (支那), I was truly deeply moved to be in the presence of the Emperor (天顏) at Nijūbashi Bridge, and moreover, to witness His Majesty bestowing the Imperial Rescript (勅語) with his clear voice (玉音).
The enthusiastic celebrations by the six million citizens of the Imperial Capital over the two days of the ceremony were also wonderful, and I too stood on a street near Hibiya Park (日比谷公園) at night and shouted "Banzai!" (萬歲) in celebration with the citizens at the top of my lungs.
Thinking about it, such a grand ceremony is the most prosperous event seen in the 2,600 years since the founding of the nation, and it will likely not happen again in my lifetime.
Even today, having returned to Keijō (Seoul) after finishing my celebratory journey, my body still trembles with emotion as if I were still there before Nijūbashi Bridge in Tokyo.

*Min Kyu-sik (閔奎植), President of Dong-il Bank (東一銀行)*

**Passing This Emotion Down to Descendants Forever**

As you gentlemen on the Peninsula (半島) have likely already seen from the news that spread throughout the entire country, we fifty-five thousand subjects (臣草) gathered before Nijūbashi Bridge and respectfully offered our congratulations to His Majesty. <79>
The weather that day was clear and bright, without a speck of cloud in the vast sky, and the late autumn breeze gently caressed our sleeves. Outside the celebration venue, the six million citizens of Tokyo were celebrating, and we, close to His Majesty, shouted "Long live His Imperial Majesty!" (聖壽萬歲). The emotion of that moment is beyond description by brush or tongue.
Now, as we are about to greet the fifth year of the Holy War (聖戰), the fact that one hundred million subjects (一億臣民) celebrated these eternal 2,600 years of the Imperial line with one heart makes me believe the future of the Empire is boundlessly bright, and I wish to pass this emotion down to my descendants forever.

*Chang Chik-sang (張稷相), Member of the Central Council (中樞院參議)*

**Even Mengjiang Representatives, All East Asians Were There**

Having bathed in the honor of attending the 2600th Anniversary Commemorative Ceremony, my deep emotion and joy are impossible to express with my clumsy pen and tongue. Among those feelings, the points I especially want to record are the following:
One, the Imperial Rescript (御勅語) bestowed by His Majesty the Emperor in response to the congratulatory address (壽詞) by Prime Minister Konoe, filled with the sincerity (赤誠) felt by all one hundred million compatriots (同胞)... Truly, that moment—should I call it solemn, or perhaps august?—His voice was truly like that of a living god. Its clarity, its power; I shed tears without thinking.
Two, among the over fifty thousand attendees were people from Mengjiang (蒙疆人), Manchukuo (滿洲國人), North China (北支), Central China (中支), South China (南支)—representatives from all over East Asia were gathered. It was a scene where one could not help but think that, in name and reality, His Majesty is indeed the leader (盟主) of East Asia (東亞).

*Yi Un-hak (李雲鶴) / Toyonaga Hōu (豊永鵬宇), Governor of Kyŏngsŏng County, North Hamgyŏng Province*

**The Coming 2700th Grand Ceremony Will Be Global**

As one citizen, bathing in the glory of attending the once-in-a-thousand-years national grand ceremony, I participated in the two-day commemorative and celebratory ceremonies. Awed by the presence of Their Majesties the Emperor and Empress, I beheld the Imperial countenance (天顔) nearby, and on both days, received the Imperial Rescript (勒語 - likely 勅語) in His clear voice (玉音朗朗). This was the first time in my life I was struck with such deep emotion, and I could only feel tears of gratitude. Particularly, the sight of the fifty-five thousand attendees during the ceremony, without even a single cough, as if in an uninhabited place, was a scene that could only be seen among the Japanese people. If we proceed with this mood of solemnity and tension, when we greet the coming 2700th year, <80> I believe our country's position in the world and its development can be roughly imagined, and my heart leaps at the thought. From now on, I am resolved to offer my sincerity and public service (至誠奉公の赤心) to repay even one ten-thousandth of the Imperial benevolence.

*Kim Ch'ŏl-chin (金哲鎭), Member of the South Chŏlla Provincial Assembly*

**Burning with Resolve for Self-Sacrificing Service**

Attending the 2600th Celebration Ceremony boils down to just two characters: deep emotion (感激). This joy, this gratitude felt only by those blessed to live in this sacred reign, cannot be fully expressed by brush and paper. My resolve to strive for self-sacrificing service (一死奉公), the completion of Naisen Ittai (內鮮一體 - Japan and Korea as One Body), and strengthening the home front (銃後) only becomes firmer, a vow I make to myself. Conceptually, this is all I can write.

*Kim Sa-yŏn (金思演), President of Chōsen Kōji Co., Ltd. (朝鮮麯子株式會社) & Member of the Central Council (中樞院參議)*

**A Vow of Service for the Sake of the Nation**

Attending the Kigen 2600 Celebration Ceremony,
Having received the honor of attending the once-in-a-thousand-years great ceremony, and awed by beholding the august figures (御英姿), I consider it an honor beyond my station.
I wish to keep this deep emotion in my heart for life and further exert my sincerity in service (御奉公の誠) for the sake of the nation (邦家).

*Yu Chong-ha (柳鍾夏) / Yanagawa Tadahiro (柳川忠廣), Member of the North Hamgyŏng Provincial Assembly*

**This Blessing in a Critical Time**

Eternal 2600 years. To think that someone like me could bathe in the glory of attending this unprecedented ceremony is simply the extreme of awe and deep emotion (恐懼感激). The two days of the ceremony were perfectly clear Japanese weather, ideal celebration days. Being able to behold the Imperial countenances (龍顏) of Their Majesties the Emperor and Empress close up, I was choked with tears of gratitude, keenly feeling the blessings of life under the Imperial rule (皇國享生の恩澤).
Now, as our Empire faces an unprecedentedly critical situation (重大時局) and is advancing towards the construction of a New Order in East Asia (東亞新秩序) and the establishment of a world co-prosperity sphere, we subjects must single-mindedly uphold the Imperial will (聖旨) and, through self-annihilation for the public good (滅私奉公), pledge from the bottom of our hearts to repay even one ten-thousandth of the Imperial benevolence.

*Higashihara Tokkō (東原德光), Head of Kyesŏng Township, Ch'angnyŏng County, South Kyŏngsang Province*

**Beholding the August Figures and Practicing the Way of the Subject**

Respectfully reply: I celebrate your continued prosperity. Please find my thoughts on my recent trip to Tokyo <81> below.
Note:
Attending the glorious, once-in-a-thousand-years 2600th Kigen Ceremony and Celebration, as a humble person from the fields and villages of the peninsula, beholding the august figures (御英姿) was nothing but tears of gratitude. Firmly pledging in my heart to repay the Imperial benevolence, I returned straight home. Hereafter, with renewed determination, I will practice the way of the subject (臣道), diligently work within my occupational sphere (職域), and hope to repay even one ten-thousandth of the national benevolence (國恩).

*Yi Chu-ch'an (李周燦) / Kiyama Shūsan (木山周燦), Head of Kyŏngsŏng Township, North Hamgyŏng Province*

**That Moment When Prime Minister Konoe Presented the Congratulatory Address**

Born in the Japanese Empire, eternal and boundless like heaven and earth for 2,600 years, it is the utmost awe and deep emotion (恐懼徹激) to have been able to attend the unprecedented ceremony as one of the representatives of township heads from the province. As the sound of the Kimigayo trumpet echoed from the direction of the Nijūbashi Bridge at the Imperial Palace (宮城), Their Majesties soon arrived at the ceremony site. The moment I beheld their divine, revered figures (神々しき御尊姿) was truly the peak of deep emotion. When the presentations of the congratulatory addresses (壽詞) by Prime Minister Konoe and Prince Takamatsu (高松宮殿下), intended to resonate throughout the land, concluded, His Majesty the Emperor soon bestowed the Imperial Rescript (勅語), which the Grand Chamberlain held up. Listening to the Imperial voice (玉音) with bowed head, I, a man of the peninsula (半島人), especially felt my eyelids wet with tears of gratitude, awed by the profound Imperial thoughts (聖慮宏遠).
To repay this boundless Imperial benevolence (聖恩), I pledge further resolve and effort toward achieving the mission of the Empire's logistics base (帝國兵站基地), vowing service through my occupation (職域奉公). Feeling the joy of having received life in this sacred reign and envisioning the flourishing state and people of the Empire, I felt that the great enterprise of constructing the New Order in East Asia (東亞新秩序) was close at hand.

*Pak Pong-jin (朴鳳鎭), Member of the Central Council (中樞院參議)*

**The Celebration Ceremony and a Matter of Deep Regret**

Greetings. I congratulate your company on its continued prosperity. Regarding the brilliant 2600th Celebration Ceremony this time, although I received the gracious command to attend, circumstances arose preventing me, and losing the honor of attending is something I consider a matter of lifelong deep regret (痛恨事). <82>

**Summary**

This article compiles short memoirs from eleven prominent Korean figures (members of the Yi royal household office, newspaper presidents, bankers, Central Council members, provincial assemblymen, county/township heads) who attended the Japanese Empire's Kigen 2600 (2600th Anniversary) celebrations in Tokyo in November 1940. They uniformly express overwhelming gratitude, awe, and emotion at witnessing the ceremonies, seeing the Emperor and Empress, and hearing the Emperor's rescript. They pledge unwavering loyalty, renewed commitment to public service (奉公), support for the war effort ("Holy War," "home front"), and dedication to the "New Order in East Asia" and the ideal of "Naisen Ittai" (Japan and Korea as One Body). One contributor expresses deep regret at being unable to attend.

From the perspective of Korean colonial history, this article is highly revealing. It showcases the voices of the Korean elite collaborating with or compelled to publicly support the Japanese colonial regime during a period of heightened wartime mobilization and assimilation policy (皇民化政策). The effusive, often identical-sounding expressions of loyalty and emotion towards the Japanese Emperor highlight the immense pressure and ideological conformity demanded under colonial rule, serving as propaganda demonstrating the success of assimilation efforts to both Japanese and Korean audiences. Historians would find the uniformity of rhetoric, the specific Imperial Japanese terminology employed (聖恩, 皇國臣民, 奉公, 滅私奉公), and the participation of high-profile Koreans in this state ritual significant evidence of elite response and state control during the late colonial period.

皇紀二千六百年式典に參列して
李王職長官男爵 李恒九

待ちに待ちたる、皇紀二千六百年も年の始めに來た。そして祝典は秋御擧行と聞いた。聞いた其の頃から、千戴一遇の皇恩に浴することが出來ると喜んで待つて居た各所でも各樣な催しが次から次へと催され國民全般をして一層意義を深め且つ感激に滿たしめた。
遂に十一月の十日十一日は目前に迫つた。私は此の又と逢ひ難い新體制下に於ける曠古の式典に對して心を落ち付けて、腹の底から皇恩の無窮と國運の隆昌とを專念し、皇恩の鴻大無邊とに感激しながら、式典に參列した。
九日の夜迄は一般に危なまれた天氣も十日の早朝からは一點の雲もなく、からりと晴れ渡り、式典は開始された。
天皇皇后兩陛下の行幸啓の下にイトも嚴かに擧行せられた。私は、兩陛下の程遠からぬ處に居て始終、天顔を拜し奉りつくぐ皇國臣民のありがたさに淚をこぼさずには居られなかつた。
翌十一日も前日同樣天氣晴朗、目のあたりに神靈の加護を如實に蒙りつゝあるありがたさを感じ此處にも神國＜78＞日本の神の國たることをつくぐ感じた。此の日の奉祝會は午後から擧行せられた。畏れ多くも前日同樣に、兩陛下の行幸啓を仰ぎ奉り、彌々、盛大に擧行され參列者五萬何千名に一々饌を戴いた。此の感激は到底言葉や筆ではよく盡し難いものがある。
兩日ともに不思議に、不思議ではないこれは全く神の御加護に相違ない天氣晴朗、緊張し切つた臣民の集ひの群、眞に大日本帝國にあらざれば見ることも想像も及ばぬ光景と思つた。そして又皇國日本を背負ふに充分余りある力の集ひだと今更ながら感じ、皇恩の鴻大無邊と此の聖代に皇國臣民として今日の大日本帝國に生れたることのありがたさをつくぐ感泣し只管、聖壽の無窮と國運の隆盛と國威の宣揚を祈念し、深くく感激致して居る次第であります。

五萬五千の臣草に列して
每日新報社長 崔麟

內地は勿論、朝鮮、臺灣、樺太より、將又、滿洲國と友邦支那より、民草五萬五千が、參列の榮を得たるその內の一人として、私が二重橋前に於て天顏に、咫尺し奉りあまつさへ、陛下より玉音朗々と、勅語を賜る御姿を邦し、誠に、感激を覺えました。
式典の兩日に亘り帝都六百萬市民の熱誠をこめた、祝賀振りは、又素張らしいものでありまして、私も夜、日比谷公園附近の街頭に立つて、市民と共に奉祝の萬歲を聲あらん限り叫びました。
思へば此の樣な盛大なる式典は肇國以來、二千六百年間始めて見る盛況でありまして、私の一生涯に再びとありませんでしよう。
奉祝の旅を終へ京城に歸つて來た今日も矢張り身は東京のあの二重橋前にある如く感激にふるへで居ります。

此の感激を永へに子孫へ
東一銀行頭取 閔奎植

全國津々浦々に擴まりました「ニユース」に依つて、半島內の諸氏も旣に御覽になつたでしよう通り、我等臣草五萬五千は二重橋前に集り謹んで、陛下へ奉祝申上げで參りました。＜79＞
當日は天氣淸朗、滿天に一片の雲覓だになく、晩秋のそよ風徐ろに袂を撫てで居ました、そして、奉祝場外には東京市民六百萬の奉祝があり、我等は陛下に咫尺し奉り聖壽萬歲を叫びました。この瞬間の感激は筆舌に盡せませぬ。
今や聖戰第五年を正に迎えんとする時、一億臣民一心となつてこの悠久たる、皇統二千六百年を御祝ひ申し上げたことは、實に帝國の前途、輝かしき限りと存じ、この感激を永へに子孫へ迄御傳致したいと思ひます。

蒙疆代表迄も全東洋人が
中樞院參議 張元稷相

二千六百年記念祝典に參列の榮に浴した、私の感激と喜びとは拙き私の筆舌を以て表現することは出來ないものがあります、其の內特に記したいことは左の點でありました。
一、一億同胞の誰しも念ふ赤誠をこめたる近衛總理大臣の壽詞に對し、天皇陛下の下し給はれたる御勅語…實にあの瞬時は莊嚴と云はんか、又嚴肅と唱へんか眞に生ける神さながらの御聲であり、其の淸がしさ其の力强さ、思はず落淚しました。
二、參列者五萬有餘の中には、蒙疆人、滿洲國人、北支中支、南支、其の東洋のあらゆる代表者を網羅し、名實俱に我が陛下が東亞の盟主にましませることを思はずにはゐられない狀景でした。

來る二千七百年盛典は世界的に
咸北鏡城郡守 豊永鵬宇

千載一遇の國家的の盛典に國民の一人として、參列の光榮に浴し二日間に亘る記念式典並奉祝式典に參列し畏くも、天皇皇后陛下の臨御あらせられ、天顔を側近に拜し兩日共に玉音朗朗として勒語を賜はりたるは生を受けて初めでの感激に打たれた次第にして全く感涙を覺ふるのみでありました。殊に五萬五千人の參列者が擧式中には咳一つなく全く無人の境の如き姿は、日本國民でなければ見られざる光景でありましだ。此の謹嚴と緊張振の氣分で進むなれば來るべき二千七百年を迎へたときは我＜80＞國の世界に於ける地位と其の發展振は凡そ想像ずることが出來ると思ふとき全く胸が躍るのであります。私は今後至誠奉公の赤心を獻げ以て皇恩の萬分の一に對へ奉る覺悟であります。

一死奉公の決意に燃ゆ
全南道會議員 金哲鎭

二千六百年祝賀式典に參列して、唯感激の二字に盡きる、聖代に生を亨けたる者のみ感ずる此喜び、此有難さは筆紙に盡ぐし得ない所である。一死奉公內鮮一體完成銃後の守りに邁進すベき念愈々固く自ら誓ふのみである觀念的に斯く書けるのみ。

邦家の爲め御奉公の念を
朝鮮麯子株式會社長 中樞院參議 金思演

紀元二千六百年祝賀式典に參列して、
千載一遇の御盛典に參列の榮を得、畏くも、御英姿を拜し奉り身に餘る光榮と存じます。
此の感激を終生胸に秘めて益々邦家の爲御奉公の誠を致し度いと念じて居ります。

重大時局にこの有難さ
咸北道會議員 柳川忠廣(舊名柳鍾夏)

悠久二千六百年。曠古の式典に私の如きが參列するの光榮に浴しました事はただぐ恐懼感激の極みであります。式典の二日間は全く日本晴で絕好の奉祝日和でした天皇、皇后兩陛下の龍顏を目の邊り拜することを得まして感淚にむやび、皇國享生の恩澤をしみじみと感じるのであります。
今や我が帝國は前古未曾有の重大時局に直面し東亞新秩序の建設と世界共榮圈の確立に邁進しつゝあるの時つれぐ臣民はひたすら聖旨を奉體し滅私奉公以て皇恩の萬分之一にても報ひ奉らんことを衷心より御誓ひ申上げる次第であります。

御英姿を拜し臣道實踐を
慶南昌寧郡桂城面長 東原德光

謹復 益々御多祥の段奉慶賀候陳者小生の今回東上感想＜81＞は左記の通りに付御承諒被下度御願申答候
記
千載一遇の光輝ある二千六百年紀元式典及奉祝式に參列し半島の草野一遇として御英姿を拜し奉りたることは唯感泣の外なく衷心皇恩に報わんと誓ひを堅くし一路還歸爾後益々覺悟を新にして臣道の實踐を爲すと共に專心職域に精勵し國恩の萬分之一でも報いたいと存じます。

近衞首相壽詞奏上のあの瞬時
咸北鏡城面長 木山周燦

悠久二千六百年天壤と共に窮みなき、日本帝國に生を亨け道內面長代表の一人として、曠古の式典に參列の光榮に浴し得ましたこと、ただ恐懼徹激の至りであります。君が代のらつぱの音が宮城二重橋の方より鳴り響くと間もなく、兩陛下は式場に着御遊ぱされ神々しき御尊姿を拜する一瞬誠に感激の極致でした。近衛首相及高松宮殿下の津々浦々に響けよと壽詞の奏上が終ると軈で聖上陛下には侍從長の捧げ奉る勅語を賜はり給ふ、首を垂れて玉音を拜聽する時、半島人たる本職のことさらただ感激の淚に瞼を濡らし聖慮宏遠詢に恐懼の次第でした。
此の無邊の聖恩に報らるため帝國兵站基地の使命達成に一層の覺悟と努力を以て職域奉公を誓ひ生を此の聖代に亨けたる喜びと帝國の彌榮に行く姿仲び行く民の姿を目繫して東亞新秩序の建設の偉業達成に目捷たと感じたのであります。
