Women's Corps and "Volunteer Soldiers"
Thirty-eight women from upper and middle-class families in Seoul visited the Volunteer Soldier Training Center in Kongdŏk-ri, Seoul. Here, they write down the inspiration they saw and heard that day, conveying their feelings to everyone.

Life is Orderly and Disciplined
By Kim T'aekkugyŏng (Kanazawa Kikuei?), Vice-District Chief, Aebu Western First District Town

Spending a day at the Volunteer Soldier Training Center, I felt my melancholic mood naturally lift. Youth literally means springtime, representing the core class receiving the era's greatest expectations and the driving force shouldering heavy responsibilities. However, for some reason, Korean youth generally seemed less vigorous compared to those of other countries, often leading to disillusionment. But seeing the dignified spirit and bearing of the volunteer soldiers, and the orderliness of their daily lives, I keenly felt the greatness of guidance and training. As subjects of the Empire (皇國臣民), the leader of East Asia fighting a Holy War, I felt thrilled with excitement for their future blessings. Parents with sons must renew their spirits and pledge to enroll their sons in the training center. Lastly, I express my gratitude to the sponsor, the National Training Support Association (國民訓練後援會).

Women Also Need Training
By Song Kŭmsŏn, Principal, Tŏksŏng Women's Vocational School

I keenly felt how great the power of teaching is.
Seeing firsthand how even unrefined people from the countryside, who hadn't received proper training, could become so splendid in just 3 or 4 months, I earnestly wished that we women could also receive such training.

A Group of Youths Always "Prepared"
By Kim Suim, Severance Hospital

Actually, upon receiving the notice from the National General Mobilization Association (國民總力會) to attend, it was very difficult due to work, and I considered skipping it. But thinking it over, I figured there must be (144) some meaning behind sending this notice and firmly decided to make time and attend. However, due to a streetcar delay, I was late and missed the train. Staring blankly at the departing train carrying the group, thinking perhaps it was my fate not to go today, Major Kaba (蒲少佐) also arrived late. So, inevitably, I had the honor of riding with Major Kaba in a small taxi to the training center. Upon entering the training center, what surprised me was the cleanliness. Hundreds of young men living together in a narrow space, yet how could it be so clean? I was astonished. Every nook and cranny was spotless. I deliberately wet my fingertip, thinking 'surely there must be dust here,' and touched various spots, but finding not a speck, I blushed with embarrassment and looked at the people beside me; they too had expressions of admiration. Unknowingly, I felt my eyes grow hot. The second surprise was the orderliness. Despite having 28 men crammed into rooms meant for 12, each person's belongings were arranged so they could find them even with their eyes closed. Not only that, but daily life, from meals (145) to everything else, was order itself. And their actions and expressions, especially the look in their eyes, were lively and brave. Their posture was always one of readiness for any sudden incident. Arm movements, leg movements, stride – all were sheer dynamism, making observers feel instantly alert. According to Major Kaba's passionate explanation, most of them were farmers when they first entered, and their attitudes were all dull. Without seeing it firsthand, no one could know how great the effort and labor of those in charge of this training center were, to create such a clean and orderly life and be able to proudly show it off to visitors. It's a shameless thought, but I wanted to resent everyone for why this training center didn't exist sooner. And for some reason, it's truly strange. When I picture the faces and actions of each of those volunteer soldiers in my mind, even now, I feel proud and cherish them, and tears keep flowing. Lastly, I am endlessly grateful to Major Kaba and Mr. Nomura (野村氏) who took time out of their precious schedules to call upon us, who had been somewhat indifferent towards the volunteer soldiers, and showed us their passion and sincerity. (146)

A Volunteer Soldier for a Son-in-Law
By Kondō Hanaki, Kyŏngsŏng-bu, Asahi-machi 2-57 (京城府 旭町 2ノ57)

It's already the third year since the Volunteer Soldier Training Center was established in Korea. While its importance is recognized by both the Korean and Mainland (內地) sides and it is welcomed with considerable enthusiasm, it seems that women on both the Inner (內 - Mainland Japan) and Korean (鮮) sides generally hold no more interest than if it were a neighbor's affair. Recognizing that this is not commendable in this critical situation, a group of concerned Korean women decided to visit the training center to deepen their understanding. The inspiration felt by anyone who glimpses this place will undoubtedly be conveyed to hundreds, even thousands. As one of them, I want to record at least a part of that inspiration.

Reliable Volunteer Soldiers
Director Kaita (海田所長) was away in Tokyo for the 2600th Anniversary Celebration, so Professor Morimoto's (森本敎授) kind explanation continued for over an hour. The gist is as follows: The Volunteer Soldier Training Center was promulgated by imperial ordinance in February of Shōwa 13 (1938). The peninsula's first volunteer recruitment test was held that June at the Kaikōsha (偕行社) in Ryūzan (龍山 - Yongsan). For the annual quota of 400, 2,946 applicants took the first step onto the shining path of participating in the Imperial Army (皇軍). Eligible candidates meeting conditions such as being aged 17 or older and under 25, height over 1 meter 60, elementary school graduate or higher, and having no worries <146> about dependents, numbered 1,663. From these, a further selection process chose 200 candidates who passed and gloriously ascended the "dragon gate" as eggs of the Imperial Army's brave soldiers.

Improving Quality
In Shōwa 14 (1939), the number of applicants increased further. For an annual quota of 600 (divided into two 6-month terms), the total number of applicants reached 12,548, with 6,247 eligible candidates. Therefore, as a result of the rigorous selection of 600 from among them, the quality naturally showed improvement over the previous year. Those who have received higher education and those belonging to middle-class or higher families are gradually increasing.
In Shōwa 15 (1940), based on the results of Shōwa 13 and 14, it was recognized that 4 months of training was sufficient instead of 6 months, and the training period became 4 months. Thus, the year was divided into three terms, and the capacity per term leaped to 1,000, resulting in an annual capacity to accommodate 3,000. For this quota of 3,000, the total number of applicants reached a staggering 84,500, with 40,000 eligible candidates. The quality, naturally, surpasses that of Shōwa 13 and 14. Among them are cases such as someone who graduated from normal school and was teaching elementary school, but volunteered after realizing the difficulty of instilling a national consciousness (國家觀念) in imperial children without experiencing military education <147>, and policemen who volunteered, believing military training is necessary for guiding the populace. In any case, this thoroughly refutes the mistaken perception that only those who cannot make a living become volunteer soldiers. Children of prestigious families are gradually volunteering, and the fact that they return to their regions possessing the compelling power to guide the local youth is a welcome phenomenon for the future of Korea.

Spirit of Patriotism
There are currently 1,021 trainees in residence, who have already completed three months of training and have one month left until completion. Every day, they receive various academic subjects centered on spiritual education (精神敎育) as subjects of the Empire (皇國臣民). For example, even in history, the objective is to promote the spirit of Bushidō through historical facts, teaching things like how even in Korea, the Silla era's warrior spirit was filled with pure loyalty and patriotism (純忠愛國).

A Volunteer Soldier for a Son-in-Law
When this system was first established, Chiang Kai-shek's warlords spread disinformation, claiming, "Japan is finally short of soldiers and has forcibly made peninsula youth become volunteer soldiers." A certain country spewed various arbitrary malicious slanders, such as, "Japan recruited 400,000 Korean youths to supplement its military strength." However, by now, everyone should be able to recognize that this is by no means a desperate measure by Japan to compensate for a lack of military strength, nor is it coercion. It is a gracious system stemming from the great Imperial will (大御心) of 'equal treatment for all' (一視同仁), based on the sacred intention (聖旨) that since Koreans are also His Majesty's children (陛下の赤子), the youth of the peninsula should also bear the duty of national defense alongside mainland soldiers. If women also recognize this, phenomena like the one mentioned earlier [canceling engagements] would not occur. There was a story from a certain region where an engagement was hastily canceled because the fiancé became a volunteer soldier. This will surely become an old tale someday, but I earnestly hope for cooperation so that the day comes quickly when recognition reaches the point of saying, "We won't let our daughter marry anyone but a volunteer soldier."

Words of Gratitude
After listening to such enthusiastic talks, we toured the entire facility. The rooms were impeccably tidy without a single thread out of place, the corridors gleamed without a speck of dust, their table manners were dignified, and the seriousness of their training on the athletic field was humbling. Currently, the training center's capacity is rapidly increasing, and it is undergoing major expansion with a budget of 730,000 yen, causing some disruption with workers coming and going. However, undeterred by such things, we express our respect to the volunteer soldiers who are striving towards their intended goals without distraction, and offer limitless gratitude for the efforts of the instructors <148> who have trained them so effectively, before setting off on our return journey.

The Old Life Lived Recklessly
By Chŏn Hŭibok, Culture Department, Kyŏngsŏng Ilbo

I was truly moved that their lives, formerly lived recklessly and without direction, not only gained order and discipline in just 3 or 4 months, but that in doing so, their bodies and minds were forged, turning them into splendid individuals—as individuals, members of society, and citizens of the nation—without the slightest shame or hesitation. <149>

Impressions
By Ozeki Hisako, Kyŏngsŏng-bu, Yoshino-chō 1-chōme 32 (京城府 吉野町 1丁目 32)

This visit to the Volunteer Training Center (志訓 - Shikun) was truly observed with immense emotion by us, the mainland <149> women. I truly experienced something that perhaps only mainland women could perceive. It was truly a historic feeling. The day before this visit, I unexpectedly had the chance to meet the peninsula's philanthropist, Mr. Nomura Kōtatsu (野村弘達氏), and though it may be rude to call it preparatory knowledge for the visit, I heard his spiritual talk and was deeply moved. So on the 15th, the day of the visit, I returned carrying an even greater emotion than the other members. I truly discovered the strong, fierce spirit that had been hidden within the peninsula's youth until now, and felt deeply impressed that the reality of Inner-Korean Harmony (內鮮融和 - Naissen Yūwa) truly begins from now. (Actually, the day before the visit, after meeting Mr. Nomura, I wrote down my impressions on eight sheets of paper. I wrote this in an essay/report style; would you please consider publishing it? — A doodle was here instead of a signature)

Center and Unity in Life
By Sangjŏn Yongnam (Ueda Tatsuo?), Ch'angsin-jŏng West 59-21 (昌信町 西59ノ21)

They created "center" and "unity" in our lives. In silence, paving a great path towards the future, there was only the effort to concentrate the scattered lives of Korean people towards a center and to unify into "one" the reality of Korea where power and spheres of interest each try to establish their own positions.
How handsome they looked. How brave they were. Their guns aimed at one target (한관역 - likely 韓半島 or a symbolic target?), their swords unified Asia.
The Emperor's Shields (天皇の御楯)! This must surely be the highest honorable title to attach above their heads.
Youths of Korea, all become soldiers. Without saying a word, just become soldiers.

New Education Policy for Eight Sons and Daughters
By Kim T'aektŏkcha (Kanazawa Tokuko?)

I have eight children, sons and daughters, and in their daily upbringing, I have taught the boys to be brave and have hope, and the girls to base themselves on thorough maternal love and display the innate instincts of womanhood. Thanks to blessings, they have today become, though imperfectly, pillars of society. As someone bearing the weight of nearly 70 years, I feel grateful. Youth, regardless of the nation, are the central force determining the rise or fall of a country, so they must advance in every aspect. I had heard stories daily, but actually visiting the training center and seeing the dignity of those volunteer soldiers fills me with indescribable emotion. In the current situation, I felt that Korean youth must absolutely receive excellent education under thorough training and <150> guidance like these gentlemen.

Those Shining Pupils
By Son Oksun, Sup'yo-jŏng 63, City Center (市內 水標町 63)

"Look at the light in their pupils and their facial expressions," the guide's words still ring clearly in my ears.
General moral life, brave posture, activity, etc., which should have been meticulously trained long before – I finally realized through the instructors' actual experiences how difficult these are to correct due to our insufficient home education and flawed customs. When I think of this Volunteer Training Center, where instructors strive with immense effort, sometimes like loving parents, sometimes as strict guides, nurturing the peninsula's warriors to be no less than mainland youth and training strong youth for the Empire (皇國), I first feel respect for the nation and endless gratitude towards the instructors who are fighting and striving on the ground. I felt even more profoundly the need for us to live with new resolve and effort: to quickly train our unrefined young strength, multiplying its value, thereby making greater contributions (奉公) to the nation and creating outstanding citizens ourselves. <151>

Women Should Support Them Well from Behind
By Yi Kyŏnghwan, Chŏng-dong Broadcasting Station, Kyŏngsŏng (京城 貞洞放送局)

They looked brave and strong. The aura they give off seems ready to fly even up to the sky. In their agile movements and disciplined life, we truly see the true meaning (本意) of being people of our Japan being carried out.
We could glimpse their infinite effort and learned of their sincere life records.
The lesson they showed us on the wide field, on this day without even the chilly early winter wind under the clear blue sky, was truly great. Truly, they are men of the nation (나라의 사람). Not living for themselves, but studying and striving for the eternal life of our nation that comes through them, we must bow our heads in gratitude. More than anyone, women have the duty (義務) to support them well from behind.

Light Comes to the Youth
By Mun Chŏngwŏn

Observing the sight of them tempering mind and body in the strict, disciplined life of the training center, I deeply wished (心祝) that the future of Korean youth would become even stronger pillars of the nation and society.

Women Too Should Receive Training!
By Kim Ŭngsin, Kyobuk-chŏng 6-3, Kyŏngsŏng (京城 橋北町 6의 3)

During my one-day enlistment experience at the Volunteer Training Center, I was moved by their orderly and disciplined life. Among the volunteers, there are middle school graduates and normal school graduates, but they are a very small minority, countable on one hand (3 or 4). Most are of elementary school graduate level, farmers (農軍) who farmed in the countryside. Farmers usually not only eat more heartily than cultured people but also lived irregularly. Yet, here, in the space of 4 months, how did they become such well-organized, splendid new people? Furthermore, seeing that their bodies and minds are healthier despite dietary restrictions, and watching them practice self-control by absolutely abstaining from desired cigarettes until the graduation period, it felt like entering a monastery (修道院). If this is the case, I wish not just volunteers, but all Korean youth could be made to pass obligatorily through this national factory (國民工場). And if our young Korean women could also receive 4 months of training at this training center, I felt they would truly leave behind splendid footprints as outstanding citizens (國民). <152>
<144-152>

**Summary**

This article compiles impressions from 38 upper and middle-class women, both Korean and Japanese, after visiting the Volunteer Soldier Training Center in Kongdŏk-ri, Seoul in late 1940. The contributors uniformly praise the facility's cleanliness, orderliness, and the disciplined, vigorous appearance of the Korean volunteer trainees. They highlight the transformative power of the training, turning supposedly unrefined rural youths into "splendid" individuals and loyal subjects of the Japanese Empire (皇國臣民). Several writers express deep emotion, gratitude towards the instructors, and advocate strongly for more Korean youth, including their own sons or future sons-in-law, to enlist. Some even suggest mandatory training for all Korean youth, including women, to instill discipline and patriotism. The article serves as strong propaganda promoting the volunteer soldier system, emphasizing the supposed benefits of military training for Korean youth and framing participation as a patriotic duty and a path to becoming ideal imperial subjects, aligning with the colonial ideology of Naissen Ittai/Yūwa (Inner-Korean Unity/Harmony). Historians would find the article valuable for its direct expression of collaborationist sentiment among certain segments of Korean and Japanese society, the methods used to promote military enlistment among Koreans, the gendered perspective on militarization (women supporting from behind, desiring training themselves), and the explicit linking of military service with imperial loyalty and modernization/discipline. The mention of increasing numbers of applicants, including those with higher education, and the counter-narrative against the idea that only the poor joined, are also significant points reflecting the state's efforts to legitimize and expand the program.

婦人部隊와「志願兵」
서울 孔德里, 志願兵訓練所를 訪問한 서울 上·中流 各家庭의 婦人38人이 그 날 보고 들은 感激을 여기에 적어, 써 그날의 心境을 여러분에게 傳하노라.

生活에 規律整然
愛婦西部第一區町 副分區長 金澤菊榮

志願兵訓練所에서 하로를 지내고 보오니 나에 憂鬱허든 心情이 스스로히 快함을 느끼었오이다. 靑年은 文字 그대로 靑春을 意味함이니 시대에 가장 기대를 받는 中堅階級이고 또한 重任을 雙肩에 負荷하고 있는 推進力이라 할 것이다. 그런대 朝鮮에 靑年은 何故인지 一般的으로 他國靑年에 비하여 떨치지 못하여 幻滅를 느낌이 많었다. 그런대 志願兵 諸君에 늠늠한 氣象과 態度를 보고 또 그이들에 平素生活에 規律이 整然함을 보니 指導와 訓練에 偉大함을 스스로히 느낀 바 있었다. 東亞에 盟主요 聖戰을 하고 있는 皇國臣民에 將來를 祝福하는 意味로 나는 感激히 興奮을 느끼었다. 아들을 가진 父母는 반드시 精神을 새로히 하여 모름지기 그 아들을 訓練所에 入所시킬 것을 盟誓할 必要가 있다. 끝으로 主催者 國民訓練後援會에 感謝에 意를 表한다.

女子도 訓練必要
德成女子實業學校長 宋今璇

가르킴에 힘이 그 얼마나 偉大한가를 절실히 느꼈습니다.
산골에서 변변히 訓練을 받지 못한 사람도 3, 4箇月에 저렇게 훌륭이 될 수 있다는 것을 目前에 본 결과 우리 女子도 저렇게 訓練을 해보았으면 하는 마음이 간절이 났습니다.

언제든지「準備」를 있지안는 靑年群
세부란스醫院 金壽任

사실은 國民總力會에서 오라는 通知를 받고 事務上 參席하기가 매우 어려웠음으로 고만 둘가 하다가, 곰곰 생각해보니 이 通知를 보낸대는(144) 무슨 意味가 있으리라 생각하고 단연 時間을 억지로 만드러 가지고 參席하기로 作定했던 것이 전차의 탓으로 時間이 늦어서 汽車를 놋처버렸다. 一行을 태우고 떠나가는 汽車를 반히 바라보며 아마 오늘 못 가는 運인가 보다 하고 멍하니 서있는데 맛침 蒲少佐께서도 晩到시라 할 수 없이 小型택씨로 蒲少佐와 함께 訓練所로 달리는 光榮을 입었다. 訓練所에 들어스자 놀랜 것은 淸潔 그것이었다. 나어린 靑年들이 數百名이 함께 뫃여 좁은 장소에서 生活하는데요 이렇게도 정결할 수가 있을가하고 놀랬다. 구석구석이 깨끗하다. 일부러 손끝에다 침을 묻혀 가지고 요기는 설마 몬지가 있으러니 하고 만저 보았으나 한꼬물도 없음으로 혼자 부끄러워 얼굴을 붉히며 옆에 사람들을 처다 보니 그들도 역시 感嘆하는 表情이었다. 나도 모르는 사이에 눈씨울이 뜨거워짐을 느꼈다. 둘째로 놀랜 것은 整돈이었다. 定員 12名室에 人員이 超過되어 28名式 두었는데도 不拘하고 各各 自己所持品을 눈감고라도 곧 찾어낼 수 있도록 정돈되어있다. 뿐만 아니라 食事로부터 其他 모든(145) 하로하로의 生活이 정돈 그것이었다. 그리고 그들의 行動과 表情 특별히 그들의 눈의 表情이 생생하다. 씩씩하다. 그들의 태도는 언제나 무슨 突發事件의 당하는 준비의 자태였다. 팔짓, 다리짓, 걸음거리 이 모-든 것이 약동 바로 그것이며 보는 사람으로 하여곰 정신이 펀득펀득 나게 한다. 蒲少佐의 熱中하신 說明의 依하면 그들이 처음 入所할 때는 거지반이 다- 農群이어서 그들의 태도가 모-다 멍하였다 한다. ꊷ�러면 요렇게 정결하고 정돈된 生活을 할 수 있게 만드러 놓고 여러 사람들에게 구경을 시켜서 자랑을 할 수 있게된 이 訓練所를 맡으신 여러분의 功勞과 勞力이 얼마나 큰 것을 친히 보지 않고는 아무도 모를 것 같다. 염치없는 생각이나 왜 진작부터 이 訓練所가 없었던가 하고 여러분을 원망하고 싶다. 그리고 웬일인지 참으로 이상한 일이다. 그 志願兵들의 하나하나의 얼굴과 행동을 내 마음속에 그리면 지금도 대견하고 보배로운 生覺이 드러 눈물이 작고작고 흐른다. 끝으로 그 貴하신 시간을 쪼개여 志願兵의 대해 다소 無關心했던 우리들을 불러주시어 우리로 하여금 여러분의 熱과 誠을 보여주신 蒲少佐와 野村氏께 感謝함을 마지 않는다.(146)

御婿樣に志願兵を
京城府 旭町 2ノ57  近藤花技
朝鮮に志願兵訓練所が出來てもう三年目である。朝鮮側からも內地側からも、その重要性を認められてかなりの熱意を以て迎へられてゐる割合に內鮮ともに婦人側はお隣りの出來事位の關心より持たないらしいと云ふことは、この重大なる時局に向つてあまり感心した事でないとこゝにはじめて朝鮮婦人有志の一團體が訓練所を見學してその認識を深めやうと云ふ事になつたのである。一たび、こゝを覗いた者の感激はこれを百人にも萬人にも傳へずには置かないにちがひない。私もその一人としてその感激の一部だけでも書き殘して置き度い。

賴しい志願兵
海田所長は二千六百年祝典で東上中とあつて森本敎授の親切な說明が一時間餘に渡つてつゞく。ての大要をしるせば、志願兵訓練所は昭和十三年二月勅令をもつて公布されたもので、半島最初の志願兵採用試驗はその六月龍山の偕行社で行はれた。一ケ年の定員四百名に對して志願者二千九百四十六名がはじめて拓かれた皇軍參加の輝やく道に第一歩を踏み出したのであるが、年齡滿十七歲以上二十五歲身長一メートル六○以上擧力小學校卒業以上、家庭に後願＜146＞の憂ひなきもの等の條件への適格者が一千六百六十三名もあつた、そのうちから更に節にかけられた選拔生二百名が合格者として華やかに皇軍勇士の卵として登龍門に登つたわけである。

良くなる素質
十四年度には志願者の數は更に增加して一ケ年の定員六百名に對し(六ケ月づゝ二期に分ける)志願者總數一萬二千五百四十八名、而も適格者は六千二百四十七名に及んだのであるからその中から六百名を詮衡する嚴選の結果素質は無論前年度より向上を見せてゐる。高等敎育を受けたもの、家庭も中流以上に位するものが漸次增加してゐる。
十五年度には十三年度十四年度の成績に徵し、訓練は六ヶ月を要せず四ケ月でも充分訓練し得るものと認められ、討練期間は四ケ月となつたから一ケ年三期に分けられ一期の定員は飛躍して千名即ち一ケ年三千名の收容力を出ず事になつた。その三千名の定員に對する志願者總數は實に八萬四千五百名ぱかり適格者四萬、素質は無論十三年度十四年度に優る。中には、師範學校を出て小學校に敎鞭をとつてゐるけれど、軍隊敎育の體驗なくして、軍國兒童に國家觀念を植えつける事の困難さを自覺して進んでこゝに志願したと云ふ＜147＞風なもの、巡査から民衆指導の立場には是非軍隊訓練なくしてはと入所を志願するものなど兎に角、志願兵は食へないものがなると云ふ樣な誤まれる認識を遺憾なく蹴とばして、名門の子弟も漸次志願して、地方に歸つても、その地方の靑年を指導し得る迫力を持つて歸つて行く事は朝鮮の將來の爲めにもよろこばしい現象である。

愛國の精神
現在の在所者は一千二十一名で、すでに三ケ月の訓練を經てあと一ケ月で滿期する人達である。每日皇國臣民としての精神敎育を基調とした訓育によつて藷種の學科敎育も與へられてゐる。
例へば歷史にしても、史實を通して武士道の精神を鼓吹する事が目的で、朝鮮にも新羅時代の武士道は純忠愛國の精神に滿ちてゐたと云ふ樣な行き方である。

婿樣に志願兵を

初めてこの制度が出來たとき蔣介石の軍閥は「日本もとうとう兵隊に不足をして來て、半島の靑年を强請的に志願兵たらしめた」とデマを飛ばした。
某國は「日本の兵力の不足を補はんとして四十萬の朝鮮靑年を募集して兵力を補つた」其他いろいろと勝手な毒舌を揮つたものであるが、日本が決して兵力の不足を補ふための故息な手段にあらず、强請にもあらず、一視同仁の大御心から、朝鮮も陛下の赤子である以上、半島の靑年も內地兵と共に國防の任に當るべきであると云ふ聖旨から基れた有り難き制度である事を今は皆認め得るであらう、婦人も之れを認識したならば、前述のやうな現象は起らないわけである或る地方では、婚約者が志願兵になつたと云ふのであわてゝ婚約を取り消してまつたと云ふ話があつた、やがては之れも一つの昔噺となる時が來るにちがひないが、「志願兵に非ざればうちの娘に嫁やれぬ」と云ふ位までの認識の日が一日も早く來るやうに協力せられん事を切望する。

感謝の言葉
以上のやうな熱意のある講話を聞いた後に、所內を案內されて隈なく見學したのであるが部屋の中でも一絲亂れず整然と片づき、廊下でも塵一つ止めず々艶と光つてゐるし、食事の態度も堂々たるもの、更に運動場に於ける訓練の眞劍さには頭がさがる位であつた。目下訓練所の收容定員急激に增加して、七十三萬圓の豫算で大增築中である爲め工夫が出入りしたり、混雜中ではあるが、そんなものにも防げられず、側目もふらずに所期の目的に向つて邁進してゐる志願兵藷氏に敬意を表すると共にこれだけに訓練し得た敎官諸氏の＜148＞努力に對しては更に限りなき感謝の念を捧げて歸途についた。

함부로 살든 옛 生活
京城日報 學藝部  田熙福

함부루 막 살든 그들의 生活이 不過 3, 4個月사이에 秩序와 整돈을 가추게 되는 것에 뿐 아니라 그렇게 하는 사이에 그들은 몸과 마음이 鍛鍊되어서 한 個人으로서는 勿論 社會人으로 國家人으로 조금도 부끄럼과 꺼리낌없는 훌륭한 人間이 되는 것에 眞實로 感激했습니다.＜149＞

感想
京城府 吉野町 1丁目 32  尾關久子
此の度の志訓見學實に私共、內地＜149＞婦人には絶大の感激を以て拜見させていたゞきました。全く、地地婦人でなけれげおそらく感知し得られないものを私は得、として體驗して參りました。洵に世紀的な思ひでございました。私は此の日の前日、半島の篤行家、野村弘達氏に計らずも御合ひ出來、志訓見學の豫備知識と申しては失禮ですか、精神的の御話を同ひ感激して十五日の當日は外の會員よりももつとく大きなる感激を抱いて歸つて參りました。全く、半島靑少年のいままでに包みかくされてゐた强い激しき神を見出し內鮮融和の實は、洵にこれからたと感銘深いものを覺へました。(實は見學の前日野村氏と御合ひいたしての感想を用紙八枚に書いて見ました。これは隨筆的に記事的にべン取りましたが、よろしくぱ採記下さいませんか？一筆かほでこ)

生活에 中心과 統一
昌信町 西59ノ21  上田龍男

우리 生活에「中心」과「統一」을 創造하더라 沈黙 속에서 未來를 向하여 거륵한 길을 닦는 그들은 조선사람의 헤여진 生活을 中心으로 集中시키고 勢力과 利圈이 제각끔 자리를 잡으려는 朝鮮의 現實을「하나」로 統一하려는 努力이 있을 뿐이었다.
그들 잘들도 생겼드라. 씩씩들도 하더라. 그들의 銃은 한관역을 노리고 그들의 칼은 亞細亞를 統一하더라.
天皇의 御循! 이는 그들 머리 우에 붙이는 最高의 名譽다운 稱號이리라.
朝鮮의 靑年들아 다 같이 兵士가 되라 아무 말도 말고 그저 되라.

八男妹子女에 新敎育方針
金澤德子

나는 子女 8男妹를 지니고 日常에 訓育함에 男兒는 씩씩하여라. 그러고 希望을 가져라, 女子는 徹底한 母性愛를 標準하여 女性에 天質的 本能을 發揮하여야 한다고 가르켜 왔다. 德澤으로 저이는 今日에 이르러 不足허나마 社會에 中堅이 되고 있다. 近 70의 馬齡을 가진 나는 感謝히 生覺한다. 靑年은 如何한 國家를 勿論하고 一國에 興亡盛衰를 左右하는 中心力인만큼 어떠한 점에 있어든지 前進할 必要가 있다. 日常 이야기는 드렀으나 實際로 訓練所를 訪問하고 그이들 志願兵 藷君에 늠늠함을 보니 形容할 수 없는 感懷가 있다. 時局下 今日에 朝鮮靑年은 모름즉이 藷君과 같이 徹底한 訓鍊과＜150＞ 指導下에 훌륭한 敎育을 받지 아니하면 안 된다 生覺하였다.

『눈동자에 빛과 얼굴에 표정을 보시오』하든 引導者에 말은 아즉도 귀에 쟁쟁합니다.
벌써 前부터 精密히 訓練되었어야 할 一般道德的 生活 또는 씩씩한 姿勢 活動 등은 우리들에 不足한 家庭敎育과 缺陷된 因習으로 말미암아 얼마나 힘드려서 고처지는지는 指導者에 實經驗談을 通하여 비로소 알게 되었습니다. 한때는 慈愛로운 父母와 같이 한때는 嚴한 指導者로써 千辛萬苦에 精力을 다하면서 內地靑年에게 지지 않는 半島에 勇士를 키워 皇國에 굳센 靑年을 訓練하고 있는 이 志願兵訓練所를 생각할 때는 먼저 國家에 대한 尊意와 實地에서 奮鬪努力하시는 指導者 諸氏에게 感謝에 뜻을 마지 아니하며 우리에 練磨되지 못한 젊은 힘을 어서 速히 訓練시켜 몇 倍에 價値를 發揚함으로 國家에 더 큰 奉供과 스스로가 뛰어난 國民을 만들도록 새로운 覺悟와 努力으로 지내야할 것을 一層 더 深長하게 느꼈습니다.＜151＞

女人은 그뒤를 잘 밧드자
京城 貞洞放送局  李慶煥

씩씩하고 굳세여 보힙데다. 사람에게 주는 氣勢가 하늘웋으로도 날러갈 듯 敏捷한 動作과 規律있는 生活에는 眞實로 우리 日本이 백성의 本意를 遂行하는가 봅니다.
그네의 無限한 努力을 엿볼 수 있고 그네의 誠意있는 生活記錄을 알고 왔습니다.
淸明한 蒼空아래 初冬의 싸늘한 바람도 없는 이날 넓은 마당에서 그네들이 우리에게 보혀준 敎訓은 實로 컸습니다. 眞實로 그들은 나라의 사람입니다. 나를 爲한 生이 아니고 나로 因한 우리나라의 永久한 生을 위해 工夫하고 努力하는 그들에게 머리를 숙여 感謝해야 합니다. 누구보다도 女人은 그들을 잘 받드러야 할 義務가 있습니다.

젊은이에게 光明이 오다
文貞媛

嚴格한 規律있는 訓練所 生活에서 心身을 鍊磨하시는 光景을 見學하옵고 朝鮮 젊은이들의 將來가 더욱 굳센 國家社會의 支柱되올 것을 깊이 心祝되었습니다.

女子도 訓練받기를!
京城 橋北町 6의 3  金應信

志願兵訓練所의 1日入營에서 나는 그들의 規律整然한 生活에 感激했다. 志願兵 중에는 中學卒業生도 있고 師範校出身도 있다 하나 그것은 3, 4名을 손꼽을 極히 少數에 불과하고, 大槪는 小學校 出身程度로 시골서 農事하던 農軍들이다. 農軍이라 하면 으레 文化人보다 飽食할뿐더러, 不規則하게 지나던 그들이 이곳에 와서 4個月이라는 사이에 그처럼 規模整然한 훌륭한 새사람이 된 것이라던가, 게다가 飮食도 制限이 있으나 오히려 그들의 肉體와 精神이 더 健全한 것을 볼 때, 그리고 먹고 싶은 담배도 참는 工夫를 하기 위해 卒業期間까지는 絶對로 안 먹는 것을 볼 때, 恰似 修道院에 들어선 感이 있다. 이렇다 할진댄 비단 志願者만 말고 朝鮮靑年 全部를 義務的으로 이 國民工場을 거치도록 했으면 한다. 그리고 우리 젊은 朝鮮女子까지도 이 訓練所에서 4個月間의 訓練을 받았으면 실로 훌륭한 國民으로 훌륭한 足跡을 남기리라 느꼇다.＜152＞
