Collection of Poems by Our Poets Singing of Women

My Love
Ch'unwŏn

Over the mountain, and over the mountain again
Just to catch a glimpse of my love

The mountains crossed are a hundred, ten thousand, ten thousand
The mountains yet to cross are a thousand, ten thousand?

Let it be; even if it's a hundred million,
Or a trillion, I intend to cross them.

Embarrassment
Yohan

To pick flowers on the back hill
Following my older sister, I went
Caught on a pine branch
My crimson skirt was torn.

Hoping no one would see
I came by the shortcut＜92＞
But today of all days, my beloved, whom I just met,
Appeared on the shortcut.

Not weeding beside the mulberry field,
He came out to see the new dawn.

My Departed Sister
Yohan

On the day the swallows return from Gangnam
Wearing new clothes, adorned with flowers
Young girls and brides walking before and behind
My sister went to the back hill.

I thought she went and would return
But covered with soil, covered with green turf
Even if the rooster drawn inside the folding screen
Crows, she cannot come back.

Even if the balsam flowers on the stepping stone
Bloom, she cannot come back.

The Mind Wishing to Meet
Sowŏl

Evening falls, and the path grows dim
On the distant mountain, darkening, a lost cloud
This desire to meet, what is the reason for it?
That person has no way of coming
Whom are my feet going out to meet?
In the sky, the moon rises, and the wild geese cry.＜93＞
＜92-93＞

**Summary**

This article presents a collection of four short poems by prominent Korean poets Ch'unwŏn, Yohan, and Sowŏl, all focusing on themes related to women. The poems explore emotions such as unwavering longing for a loved one ("My Love"), youthful embarrassment ("Embarrassment"), the finality of grief over a lost sister ("My Departed Sister"), and the lingering, perhaps irrational, hope of encountering someone ("The Mind Wishing to Meet"). From a historical perspective, this collection is interesting as it showcases Korean lyrical poetry published in Hangul during the Japanese colonial period (1931). It reflects the continuation of Korean literary expression, focusing on personal and emotional themes, featuring well-known writers of the time using the Korean vernacular script.

女人을 두고 노래한 우리시인의 詩篇集
님
春園

산넘어 또 산넘어
님을 꼭 뵈옵과저

넘은 산이 百이만만
넘을 산이 千가 萬가

두어라 億이요
兆라도 넘어볼가 하노라

북그러움
요한

뒷 동산에 꼿 캐러
언늬 따라 갓더니
솔가지에 걸니어
당홍 치마 찌젓습네.

누가 행여 볼가하여
즈름길로 왓더니＜92＞
오늘따라 새뵈는 님이
즈름길에 나왓슴네.

뽕밧 녑헤 김 안매고
새 베러 나왓슴네.

가신 누님
요한

강남제비 오는날
새옷 입고 꼿 꼿고
처녀 색시 압뒤서서
우리누님 뒤산에 갓네.

가서 올줄 아랏더니
흙 덥고 금잔듸 덥허
평풍속에 그린 닭이
우더라도 못온다네.

섬돌 우에 봉사꼿이
피더라도 못온다네.

맛나려는 心思
素月

저녁에는 지고서 어스름의 길
저먼산엔 어두워 일허진 구름
맛나려는 심사는 웬셈일까요
그사람이야 올길 바이 업는데
발길은 누 마중을 가쟌말이냐.
하눌엔 달오르며 우는 기럭이.＜93＞
