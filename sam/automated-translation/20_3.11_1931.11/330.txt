Summer Day in the Mountains
						By Manp'o Kim Chŏnggyu

On a summer day in the mountains,
Wine is fitting beside the clear stream.
Reaching people, it truly has its benefits;
The zither is suitable east of the green trees.

From where does this refreshing air come?
Turning my head, I look towards the city.
The steaming heat becomes void upon reaching here;
How unbearable is that intense, blazing red heat! <57>

**Summary**

This eight-line classical Chinese poem by Kim Chŏnggyu contrasts the serene, cool refuge of the mountains in summer with the oppressive heat of the city. The poet describes leisurely pursuits like drinking wine by a stream and playing the zither amidst green trees, highlighting the refreshing atmosphere of the mountains. Looking back towards the city, the poet emphasizes the stark difference, finding the mountain coolness a welcome escape from the urban "steaming heat." For historians, the poem offers insight into the continuation of traditional literati aesthetics and sentiments (appreciation of nature, leisurely pursuits) during the colonial period. It subtly reflects a potential desire for escapism or critique of the urban environment, which was rapidly changing under Japanese influence, contrasting it with the perceived purity and tranquility of nature.
