**Summary**

This article from the November 1, 1931 issue of Samch'ŏlli magazine outlines the structure of Japan's compulsory military service system at the time. It details the various stages and durations of service, including active duty (현역), first-line reserves (예비군), second-line reserves (후비병역), supplementary service (보충병역) divided into two categories, and national militia service (국민병역), also divided into two categories based on prior service and age. The durations varied between the army and navy and depended on the specific service category. For Korean colonial history, this article is interesting as it provides contemporary Koreans with a clear breakdown of the Japanese military system – the system of their colonizer. While Koreans were not subject to conscription in 1931, understanding this system would have been relevant given Japan's increasing militarization and the potential future imposition of service obligations on colonial subjects, which eventually happened later in the colonial period.
