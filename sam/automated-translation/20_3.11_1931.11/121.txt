An article by Mr. Kim Kyŏngjae (金璟載氏) regarding the Manchuria-Mongolia independence issue (滿蒙獨立問題) has been abbreviated (略) due to unavoidable circumstances (不得已한 事情).<27>

**Summary**

This short editorial note announces that an article by Kim Kyŏngjae concerning the "Manchuria-Mongolia independence issue" was shortened due to "unavoidable circumstances." This likely indicates censorship or self-censorship by the magazine. For historians, this brief notice is revealing as it points to the politically sensitive nature of the Manchurian situation in 1931 (following the Mukden Incident) and the constraints placed upon Korean publications discussing such topics under Japanese colonial rule. The vague reason "unavoidable circumstances" often served as a euphemism for external pressure or censorship.
