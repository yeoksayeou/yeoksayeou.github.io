Article Type: 시 (Poem)

Sitting in Gwanhae Temple, a thousand strands of fine willow stand.
Wind and mist are all my solitude; a belt of blue stream flows.

Why bother comparing rich and poor? The one path leads to the blue mountain temple.
Completely forgetting right and wrong enables sick bones to become robust.

As the sun sets, travelers hurry; looking around, the enjoyment is endless.
Grass is fragrant, grazing horses are idle; people are amidst the blue mountains.<57>

**Summary**

This poem by Kim Chŏnggyu, titled "Gwanhaesa Temple," describes the serene beauty and tranquility experienced at the temple. The poet observes the willows, the stream, and the surrounding blue mountains, finding solace and detachment from worldly concerns like wealth and social judgments ("right and wrong"). The poem evokes a sense of peace and restorative power found in nature, contrasting the bustling world (hurrying travelers at sunset) with the timeless calm of the mountain setting. From a historical perspective, the poem reflects a common theme in colonial-era Korean literature: seeking refuge and spiritual renewal in nature as an escape from the often harsh realities of contemporary life under Japanese rule. The emphasis on forgetting worldly strife and finding health in seclusion could be interpreted as a subtle form of passive resistance or detachment from the colonial situation.
