Company Announcement

Regarding the open letter addressed to Mr. Ch'oe Rin (崔麟氏) and the written responses from over fifty individuals concerning a certain issue (某問題), we announce that, due to unavoidable circumstances (不得已한 事情), we were unable to publish them.

Respectfully, The Editorial Department (編輯局白) <44>

**Summary**

This brief announcement from the editorial department of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine informs readers that an open letter intended for Ch'oe Rin, along with responses from over fifty people regarding an unspecified issue, could not be published due to "unavoidable circumstances." From a historical perspective, this notice is intriguing. Ch'oe Rin was a prominent but controversial figure involved in the independence movement who later collaborated with the Japanese. The vague mention of "unavoidable circumstances" preventing publication hints strongly at potential external pressure or censorship, likely from the Japanese Government-General, regarding sensitive political discussions or critiques involving Ch'oe Rin or the "certain issue" mentioned. Historians might find this significant as evidence of the constraints on press freedom and the careful negotiation of sensitive topics required by publishers during the colonial period.
