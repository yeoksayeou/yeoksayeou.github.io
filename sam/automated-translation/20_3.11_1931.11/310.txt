元師臺
						晩圃 金定奎

斷山入海路微開
勝地邀遊緩步來

英雄旣了前朝事
詞客猶吟此日臺

蒼松落落花侵屐
碧水洋洋酒滿盃

欲問當時無與說
斜陽惟見鳥飛廻＜56＞

Marshal's Terrace
						Manp'o Kim Chŏnggyu

Broken mountains enter the sea, the path faintly opens;
Invited to roam this scenic spot, I slowly walk here.

The hero already concluded the previous dynasty's affairs;
Yet poets still chant of this platform today.

Green pines stand sparse, flowers brush my wooden clogs;
Azure waters spread wide, wine fills my cup.

I wish to ask about those times, but there is no one to tell;
In the setting sun, I only see birds flying back. <56>

**Summary**

This poem, written in classical Chinese style (Hansi), describes a visit to a place called "Wŏnsudae" (Marshal's Terrace). The poet reflects on the scenic beauty of the location where mountains meet the sea. He contemplates the deeds of a hero from a past dynasty associated with the site, noting that while the hero's time is long gone, poets continue to commemorate the place. The poem ends on a melancholic note, lamenting the inability to learn more about the past directly, with only nature (birds in the setting sun) remaining. For historians, the poem offers insight into how educated Koreans in the colonial era engaged with historical sites and figures from Korea's past dynasties, possibly as a subtle way to reflect on lost sovereignty or past glories. The use of classical Chinese verse itself is significant in the context of cultural identity during Japanese rule.
