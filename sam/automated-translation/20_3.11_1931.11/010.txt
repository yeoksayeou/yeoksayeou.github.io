Folk Song Mood
(1) The Sorrowful Song of the Seodo Lass (西道閣氏의 愁心歌)
A dreary autumn moon shines upon P'yŏngyang Castle (平壤城), the old capital of song and dance. Tonight, the Seodo lass (西道閣氏), lamenting the night, leans against the stones of Ch'ilsŏng Gate (七星門), gazing at the distant sky, harboring sorrowful feelings (情懷).

Whether one lives a thousand years or ten thousand years, once life ends, one becomes but clouds and mist (雲霧) amidst the vast forest (萬樹長林)...

Namsan (南山) is a thousand-year mountain, and the Taedong River (大同江) is a ten-thousand-year river...

Half-old already, one cannot become young again...<1>

**Summary**

This short poetic piece, "The Sorrowful Song of the Seodo Lass," part of a "Folk Song Mood" series, captures a melancholic atmosphere in P'yŏngyang under an autumn moon. A woman from the western provinces (Seodo) reflects on the ephemeral nature of human life and the irrevocability of aging, contrasting it with the enduring presence of landmarks like Namsan mountain and the Taedong River. The poem employs traditional lyrical themes and imagery. From a historical perspective, the piece is interesting for its use of traditional Korean motifs (han, folk song style), specific cultural geography (P'yŏngyang, Seodo), and older linguistic forms during the Japanese colonial period, possibly reflecting a subtle assertion of Korean cultural identity or simply the continuation of established artistic expression.
