Mr. Min Kyu-sik's Frank Talk on the Financial World
						Reporter P
-Mr. Min is Chairman of the Board of Directors of Tongil Bank, President of Yŏngbo Hapmyŏng Company, and Director of Hwimun Middle School-

I. Awakening of Peninsula Financiers Regarding the Current Situation

Reporter - In the current situation, which is becoming ever more critical, what kind of awakening should Peninsula financiers have? I would like to hear your esteemed opinion on this matter.

Min Kyu-sik - It's the same in any field, but the financiers of Chosŏn must especially exert themselves, comply with the policies of the authorities, strive to save themselves, and at the same time, widely convey this intention to the general public and endeavor to encourage savings.

Second, I believe it is the absorption of national bonds. If we break away from the past individualistic and liberal thoughts or economic actions and make totalitarianism and nationalism the primary principle of life, we must inevitably offer ourselves to the ideals and livelihood of the state. That is, for the sake of the "greater self" which is the state, we must make the extremely small existence called "I" a sacrifice (祭物). If so, we must cooperate unconditionally in whatever the state desires. Believing that what is mine is inherently the nation's, financiers, more than anyone, must take the lead and courageously advance in the absorption of national bonds.

Next, third, is to strive to divert non-urgent funds to urgent needs, so they are used meaningfully and valuably. In the past, we often threw funds into non-urgent matters, leading to the considerable harm of not utilizing them effectively.

And fourth, I believe suppressing purchasing power to prevent inflation as much as possible is one of the urgent tasks for us financiers.<28>

II. Breakthrough Measures for Korean Small and Medium Merchants and Industrialists

Reporter - Please tell us your opinion on breakthrough measures for Chosŏn's small and medium merchants and industrialists.

Min Kyu-sik - Judging by the current various circumstances, the rationing of raw materials and supplies is extremely difficult, bringing weak, small-scale producers and merchants to a situation where advancing independently is impossible. In this respect, I think enterprise consolidation (企業合同化), setting aside technical rivalries, is perhaps one of the most crucial breakthrough measures. Consequently, I believe it is also effective in terms of efficiency.

This enterprise consolidation movement is likely the only way for small and medium merchants and industrialists to receive rations of materials and goods. Why is that? Because it is very difficult for individual producers to receive rations of goods and materials, but if they organize limited liability companies of five or perhaps ten or more people, or organize legal cooperatives and join commercial or industrial associations, it will be much easier to receive rations of goods and materials. Therefore, incorporating small and medium merchants and industrialists into such legal cooperatives, like commercial small cooperatives or industrial small cooperatives, is seen as one plan for rescuing small and medium merchants and industrialists.

What the authorities nowadays call the principle of past performance (實積主義) respects so-called vested rights and aims to let small and medium merchants and industrialists maintain their previous status. It intends to allow them to operate as before by enabling them to receive rations of raw materials and goods according to that past performance. Therefore, while it seems almost impossible for those newly starting in commerce and industry to receive rations, I think those with existing past performance will not suffer much of a blow.

For small and medium merchants and industrialists who cannot rely on the aforementioned enterprise consolidation or past performance<29> and are in a situation where closure is unavoidable, arranging a change of occupation (轉業) is seen as the final path.

III. Opinions on Advancing into Hainan Island, French Indochina, and the South Seas

Reporter - What are your thoughts on Koreans advancing into places like Hainan Island, French Indochina, and the South Seas, and please tell us about the strategy for such advancement.

Min Kyu-sik - Of course, I agree with the southward advance of Koreans. Especially at this time when a shortage of human resources is felt in the homeland (内地 - i.e., Japan), I believe the mission of Koreans in providing labor (勞務供出) and other areas is great. Therefore, I think Korean sweat is desperately needed for the development (開拓) of the South. Particularly, since Hainan Island is said to have the world's best iron mines, developing these with our hands would be good from various perspectives. Sending agricultural units to the French Indochina region to focus on farming (營農), and also putting effort into things like rubber cultivation, thereby securing resources in multiple ways, is truly a meaningful endeavor in this time of national crisis.

According to booklets or what I hear, the climate<30> in places like Hainan Island and French Indochina is quite different from what we imagined and said to be good, so even if our development pioneers advance there, I don't think they will suffer difficulties due to climate issues.

IV. Reading, Travel, etc. Related to World Affairs

Reporter - What kind of books have you been reading recently? Please recommend some good books, especially on economics. And I would be grateful if you could also share some travel stories.

Min Kyu-sik - Well, I am ashamed that I don't have much time for reading due to being busy with various miscellaneous tasks. Among the economics books I've read recently, I've only read "Controlled Economy" (統制經濟) by Takahashi Kamekichi (高橋龜一) and a few others.

I haven't traveled much either.

**Summary**

In this December 1941 interview, Min Kyu-sik, a prominent Korean businessman, outlines the expected role of Korean financiers during the escalating war situation. He stresses complete alignment with Japanese state policy, urging Koreans to save money, buy national bonds (effectively funding the Japanese war effort), prioritize state needs over personal ones, divert capital to essential industries, and curb spending to prevent inflation. For struggling small/medium enterprises facing material shortages, he advocates consolidation into larger units or cooperatives to facilitate rationing, relying on the "past performance principle" (實積主義) which favors established businesses. For those unable to survive, he suggests changing occupations. Min also strongly supports the idea of Koreans "advancing" to Southeast Asia (Hainan, French Indochina, South Seas) to provide labor and develop resources like iron and rubber for the Japanese Empire, viewing it as a crucial contribution during a "national crisis."

This article is historically significant as it provides a direct view of how a high-profile Korean collaborator perceived and promoted Korea's role within the Japanese wartime mobilization system just before the Pacific War began. It clearly shows the pressures on the Korean economy and populace to support Japanese imperial goals through financial means (savings, bonds), industrial reorganization (consolidation), and labor export (southward advance). Min's framing of personal sacrifice for the "greater self" of the state (Japan) and his endorsement of resource extraction and labor provision in occupied territories starkly illustrate the collaborator perspective during the late colonial period. Historians would find the explicit endorsement of state control (統制經濟), the discussion of rationing mechanisms (實積主義, 配給), and the promotion of Korean participation in exploiting Southeast Asia particularly revealing.

閔奎植氏의 財界淸談
						P記者
-氏는 東一銀行取締役會長, 永保合名會社社長, 徽文中學理事-

一, 時局에 對한 半島財界人의 悟覺

記者-더욱 緊迫해가는 現時 局下에 있어서 半島財界人은 如何한 悟覺를 가져야할지, 이에 對하여 先生의 高見을 拜聽코저합니다.
閔奎植-어느 方面에 있어서든지 마찬가지겠지만 朝鮮의 財界人은 더욱 奮發하여 當局의 方針에 順應해서 自身이 貯蓄을힘쓰는 同時에 一般民衆에게도 이뜻을 널리 傳하여 貯蓄獎勵에 努力해야할것입니다.
둘째로는 國債消化라고 생각합니다. 從來의 個人主義的自由主義의 思想이나 經濟行動에서 脫却하여 全體主義와 國家主義를 生活의 第一義로 삼는다면, 吾人은 모름즈기 國家의 理想과 살림에 自我를 提供하지않을수 없을것입니다. 즉 國家라는 大我를 爲해서는「나」라고하는 極히 적은 存在를 祭物로 삼아야 할것이외다. 그렇다면 國家가 願하는일에는 無條件하고 協同하여야 할것이니, 내것은 즉 나라의것이라는 精神밑에서 國債消化에 누구보다도 財界人이 率先하여 勇躍邁進하여야만 될것이라 믿습니다.
다음 셋째로는 不急한 자금을 急한데로 돌리여서 값있고 뜻있게 쓰도록 힘쓰자는것입니다 우리는 從來 急하지 않은것에 資金을 던져서 有意義하게 活用치못했던 페단이 적지않었던 것입니다.
그리고 넷째로는 購買力을 抑制하여 인푸레슌으로 될수있는데까지 防止함이 우리 財界人에게 있어서 喫緊事의 하나라＜28＞고 봅니다.

二, 朝鮮人中小商工業者의 打開策

記者-朝鮮의 中小商工業者의 打開策에 對해서 先生의 意見을 말씀해주시기를 바랍니다.
閔奎植-現在의 諸情勢로 보아, 原料及材料配給이 極히 困難하기 때문에 弱小生産業者와 商業者는 各各 獨立해서 나아가기가 不可能할 處地에 이르렷습니다. 이 點에 있어서는 技術對立에서 떠나서 企業의 合同化가 무엇보다 緊要한 打開策의 하나가 아닐까 생각합니다. 따라서 能率에 있어서도 效果的이라고 생각합니다.
이 企業合同運動은 中小商工業者들이 材料及商品의 配給을 받는데 있어서 唯一한 길일것입니다. 웨그런고 하니 生産業者 個人個人으로서는 商品과 材料를 配給받기가 매우 困難하지만 五人, 或은 什人以上의 有限會社를 組織한다든가, 또는 法的組合을 組織하여, 商業組合 工業組合에 加入한다면 商品及材料配給을 받기가 매우 쉬울것이며, 따라서 이러한 法的組合 依한 商業小組合, 工業小組合等에 中小商工業者를 包容하는것이 中小商工業者救濟策의 한 方案이라 봅니다.
요새 當局에서 말하는 實積主義라는것이 所謂旣得權을 尊重하여 中小商工業者로 하여금 前狀維持하게하려는것입니다. 그 實積에 따라서 原料及商品의 配給을 받게하여 從前대로 經營케 하려는것입니다. 그러므로 새로 商工業에 着手하려는분은 配給받기가 不可能하다싶이 되지만 從來의 實積이 있는분은그리 打擊이 없으리라 생각합니다.
以上 말씀한 企業의 合同化나, 또는 實積에 依할수 없이＜29＞不可能 廢業케 되는 處地에 있는 中小商工業者에게는 轉業을 알선시킴이 最終의 길이라 봅니다.

三, 海南島, 佛印, 南洋에 對한 進出意見

記者-海南島, 佛印, 南洋等地에 朝鮮人이 進出함이 如何하다고 보시며, 그 進出策에 對해서 말씀해 주시기를 바랍니다.
閔奎植-勿論 朝鮮人의 南方進出에는 贊意를 가집니다. 特히 內地에 있어서 人的資源의 不足을 느끼는 此際에 朝鮮人의 勞務供出 其他의 使命이 크다고 생각합니다. 그러므로 南方開拓d[더 朝鮮人의 땀이 切實히 必要하다고봅니다. 特히 海南島에는 世界第一의 鐵山이 있다니까 이를 우리의 손으로 開發시킴도 여러 角度에서 보아서 좋을것이며, 佛印地方에는 農業部隊를 派遣하여 營農에 主力케하며, 其他고무 栽培等에 힘쓰게 하여 多方面으로 資源獲得을 보는것은 國家非常之秋에 참으로 有意義한 일일것입니다
冊子에 依하거나 或은 듣는바에 依하면 海南島 佛印等地의＜30＞ 氣候도 우리의 想像하던바와는 딴판으로 좋다니까 우리의 開拓戰士가 그곳에 進出한다하드래도 氣候關係로 困難받을일은 없다고 생각됩니다.

四, 世界方面의 讀書, 旅行等

記者-近者에 先生께서는 어떠한 書籍을 읽으시는지, 特히 經濟에 關한 良書를 추천해주시기를 바랍니다. 그리고 旅行談까지 들려주시면 고맙겠습니다.
閔奎植-머, 여러 가지 雜務로 奔走해서 讀書할 時間을 많이가지지 못함으로 부끄럽게생각합니다. 近者에 읽은 經濟書籍으로는 高橋龜一著「統制經濟」라는것과 其外數冊을 읽었을 뿐입니다.
旅行亦是 別로 다니지못합니다.
