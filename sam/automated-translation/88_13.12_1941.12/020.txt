FOREIGN CURRENCY CONVERSION

Calculating recent foreign money into our currency (Japanese Yen) is as follows:

1 Dollar (弗) is approximately 4 Yen (圓) 27 Sen (錢).

1 Mark (馬克) is approximately 1 Yen (圓) 72 Sen (錢).

1 Franc (法) is 9 Sen (錢) 5 Rin (厘).

1 Pound (磅) is approximately 17 Yen (圓) 15 Sen (錢).

1 Shilling (志) is approximately 86 Sen (錢).

12 Pence (片) make 1 Shilling (志), and 20 Shillings (志) make 1 Pound (磅). <41>

**Summary**

This short piece provides the exchange rates for major foreign currencies (US Dollar, German Mark, French Franc, British Pound Sterling, Shilling, Pence) against the Japanese Yen (referred to as 邦貨, "our currency") as of late 1941. It lists the approximate value of each foreign unit in Yen, Sen, and Rin, and also clarifies the relationship between the British Pound, Shilling, and Pence. For historians, this article offers a snapshot of the official or commonly understood exchange rates involving the Japanese Yen just before the outbreak of the Pacific War. It reflects the relative valuation of currencies during a period of global tension and fixed exchange rates within the Yen Bloc, providing context for economic conditions in colonial Korea under Japanese rule.
