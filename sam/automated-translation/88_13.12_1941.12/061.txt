Hayashi Fumiko and I
						Ch'oe Chŏnghŭi

I don't know when I came to like Hayashi Fumiko. Perhaps because I liked her so much, someone, though I don't know who, once called me the Hayashi Fumiko of Korea. I didn't find being called that unpleasant.

Had it been about someone else, I surely would have been displeased. The reason I wasn't must be because I liked her tremendously. I think my feelings perhaps went beyond mere liking, to the point where I felt an affection like for one's own flesh and blood. On nights with a beautiful moon, I even happened to dream of her sometimes. Although it's true that I'm the kind of woman who usually develops feelings akin to those for a lover towards writers I like, Hayashi Fumiko was the only female writer I ever saw in my dreams.

That's not to say she's the only female writer I like. Besides her, counting female writers from overseas, there are probably many, but the reason I saw only her in my dreams is that she walked a different path from the others.

And so, I felt inclined to read anything by her. I don't usually have much interest in travelogues, but I read hers. I was drawn to how she showed more attachment to people than to scenery. And among people, she consistently showed affection for the unfortunate, the poor, the weak.

Even knowing that she now lives quite affluently in a mansion like a legation, that image of her somehow doesn't come to mind; instead, I only picture the poor Fumiko of the past, who couldn't even eat Pacific saury (秋刀魚) when she wanted to.

This psychology might be because I myself am poor, but in any case, I liked the Hayashi Fumiko of the past more.

On October 24th, she came to Keijō. My first impression upon meeting her wasn't significantly different from the her I happened to see in my dreams. <74>

She was shorter than I had thought. Her face was quite far from being beautiful. According to her own words, she thought herself ugly and assumed she wouldn't find a husband.

However, she was by no means an ugly woman. You might ask how I can say she wasn't ugly when she was short and her face was plain, but I think she was more beautiful than tall women, than women with pretty faces. It was because she possessed something in her heart that tall women, women with pretty faces, do not have. Therefore, although she was not conventionally beautiful at all, something indistinct that drifted about her whole being, from her face, her head down to her toes—something not clearly visible to the eye—made her appear more beautiful than a beauty. Perhaps that's also why the ikat-patterned (絣) kimono with black lines on a red background and the bright red coat looked as beautiful as flowers.

She was also truly wonderful standing on the speaker's platform. She didn't give the feeling of making a speech at all. She spoke quietly with a voice full of affection, like one speaking before a loved one.

—"Home science can be resolved when women have the effort and hope to try to live beautifully," she said.

She was thoroughly a woman. Among women, she was the best kind of woman. She was certainly the type of woman who would try to skillfully prepare delicious side dishes without spending money. And I thought she likely wouldn't spare any effort to live beautifully. In return, I thought she would likely never engage in 'dirty' efforts, not even once in her life.

She was delighted like a child, saying she had come to like Keijō. She regretted that although she liked traveling and had often gone as far as Antōken, she hadn't stopped by Keijō because she had no friends here. She said that from now on, she would diligently study Korean literature and Korean art. She mentioned that until now, she had only read things like Mr. Yi T'aejun's "Poktŏkpang" (福德房). While expressing her admiration, saying Mr. Yi's novel was like Chekhov's work, she looked up with a girlish face and asked, "Is he young?"

**Summary**

Ch'oe Chŏnghŭi expresses her deep, almost familial admiration for the Japanese writer Hayashi Fumiko, stemming from Fumiko's unique path and her focus on the underprivileged in her writing, which resonated with Ch'oe more than Fumiko's later success. Ch'oe recounts meeting Fumiko in Keijō (colonial Seoul), finding her appearance modest but her inner qualities profoundly beautiful. She describes Fumiko's engaging speaking style and her expressed enthusiasm for Keijō and newfound interest in studying Korean literature and art, having previously only read Yi T'aejun's "Poktŏkpang," which she compared favorably to Chekhov. From a historical perspective, the article provides a glimpse into the cultural interactions, albeit limited, between prominent literary figures of colonizer and colonized within the colonial capital. It highlights the circulation of Japanese writers in Korea, Fumiko's relative unfamiliarity with Korean literature despite her travels near Korea (Antōken, likely in Manchukuo), and Ch'oe's complex feelings of admiration mixed with a preference for Fumiko's earlier, less affluent persona, possibly reflecting Ch'oe's own circumstances or a subtle critique of assimilation into mainstream success.

林芙美子と私
						崔貞熙
何時から私は林芙美子が好きになつたか判らない。あまり好いたゝめであらうか誰からともなく、朝鮮の林芙美子だと云はれたりしたこともあつた。私はさう云はれて不愉快とも思はなかつた。
それが他の人の場合ならきつと私は不愉快であつたに違ひない。さうでなかつたのは彼女がひどく好きであつたからであらう。好きだつたと云ふ程度を越して肉身の情まで覺えたのでなかつたかと思ふ。私は月の美しい夜などたま〱彼女の夢を見たこともあつた。もともと私と云ふ女は自分の好きな作家になると戀人にでも對する樣な感情を抱くのが普通であることはあるのだが女の作家を夢の中に見たりしたのは林芙美子だけであつた。
それだと云つて私の好きな女の作家が彼女一人だけとは言はない。彼女の外にもまた海外の女流作家を數へて大勢あるであらうが、その中で彼女一人を夢の中に見たりしたのは彼女が他のものより異つた道を步いて來たからある。
それで私は彼女のものならどんなものでも讀む氣になつた。紀行文などにはあまり興味を持たないのだが彼女のものは讀んだ。讀んで彼女が景色より人間に愛着を持つたりしたところに心がひかれたのである。人間の中でも常に不遇な人間、貧し人間、弱い人間に愛着を持つのであつた。
彼女はいま公使館みたいなお邸でかなり裕かな暮しをしてゐると知つてゐながらもどうしてもさう云ふ風の彼女は目の前に浮ばずして秋刀魚が食べたくてもたべられなかつた昔の貧乏な彼女ばかりが思ひ浮ばれる。
かう云心理は私が貧乏をしてゐるせゐでもあらうがとにかく私は昔の林芙美子がもつと好きだつた。

十月二十四日、彼女が京城へ來た。彼女に逢つた初めの印象はたま〱夢の中で見た彼女と大した違ひがなかつた。＜74＞



背は思つたよりも低い。顔は美人とは相當な距離にあつた。彼女自身に言はせると自分はみにくいからもらひ手がないことと思つゝてゐたと云つてゐた。
併し彼女は決してみにくい女ではなかつた。背は低いし、顔はみにくいのにどうしてみにくい女でないと云へるかと云ふだらうが、彼女は背の高い女よりも、顔のきれいな女よりも美しかつたと思ふ。背の高い女、顔のきれいな女、さう云ふ女が持つてゐないものを彼女は心の中に持つてゐたからであつた。だから彼女はちつとも美人ではなかつたがその顔、頭から足先までの全體にたゞよふ、目にははつきり見えない何かのものは彼女をして美人より以上の美人に見せたのであつた。赤地に黑線の絣の着物と、まつ赤なコートが花の樣に美しく見えたのもそのせゐであらう。
演壇に立つた彼女も實によかつた。小しも演說をする感じがしなかつた。愛する人の前での樣な愛情のこもつた聲で靜かに語るのであつた。
―『家庭科學は女の人が美しく生き樣とする努力と希望を持つところから解決出來ます』
と云つてゐた。
彼女はどこまでも女であつた。女の中でももつともいゝ女であつた。彼女は確かに金を使はずに美味しいおかずを美味しくこしらへ樣とする女であつた。そして美しく生きるためにはどんな努力てもおしまないことゝ思つた。その代りきたない努力は一生一度もしないことゝ思つた。

彼女は京城が好きになつたと子供の樣にはしやいでゐた。自分は旅が好きであつて安東縣までよく行つたことだが京城に友達がゐないので寄らなかつたと後悔してゐた。これからはどん〱朝鮮の文學、朝鮮の美術を勉强するのだと云つてゐた。今までは李泰俊さんの『福德房』などを讀んだゞけだと云つてゐた。李さんの小說がチエホフのものゝ樣だと感激しながらその方はお若いですかと少女の樣な顔をして見せるのであつた。
