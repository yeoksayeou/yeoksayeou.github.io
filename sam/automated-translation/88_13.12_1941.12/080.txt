On Loss of Appetite and Constipation from an Irregular Life
						Yoshihara Hirokichi

I am someone who received orders to become a railway worker starting last April. Due to the strenuous railway life, which was completely different from my middle school life up until then, I eventually came to be tormented by illness. In the beginning, my head felt foggy, and during the day, I couldn't overcome drowsiness and would just doze off intermittently. But at night, it was the opposite; I couldn't get to sleep and would wake up startled even by a rustling sound. During that time, I became constipated, and on the one hand, I lost my appetite, while my weight decreased astonishingly. Not only that, but I truly suffered from nausea after eating. It was then that I happened to start taking "Wakamoto" (『와까모도』) upon the recommendation of a certain colleague.

For the first few days, I didn't feel any particular effect, but as I continued taking it, not only did my bowel movements become regular, but my appetite gradually increased as well. So, I continued taking it consecutively, and my head became clear, and my weight also increased, reaching 15 *kwan*. At the same time, I stopped feeling fatigued at all and was able to apply myself energetically to my work.

Thus, as the things that had been hindering me were resolved one by one, my stomach problems also completely cleared up. <77>

**Summary**

The article is a personal testimonial by a railway worker named Yoshihara Hirokichi about his health problems—fatigue, insomnia, constipation, loss of appetite, weight loss, and nausea—caused by the transition from school to strenuous railway work. He describes how taking the health supplement "Wakamoto," recommended by a colleague, gradually alleviated his symptoms, restoring his appetite, regular bowel function, energy levels, and overall well-being, leading to weight gain and improved work performance. From a historical perspective, this piece is interesting as it reflects health concerns among laborers during the colonial period, the nature of personal testimonials used in advertising (likely for Wakamoto, a popular Japanese product), and the physical toll of demanding jobs like railway work under the Japanese administration in Korea. It also showcases the language and common health complaints of the era.

不規則한 生活에서 食慾不振과 便秘에
						吉原廣吉
저는 작년 4월부터 철도원의 拜命을 받은 사람입니다. 이때까지의 중학교 생활과는 아주 딴판인 과격한 철도생활 때문에 나종에는 병마에 씨달림을 받게 되였습니다. 始初에는 머리가 멍-하고 낮이면 조으름을 이기지 못하여 꼼박 꼼박 조을기만 하였습니다. 그런데 밤에는 또 그와 반대로 잠을 이루지 못하고 바스락 소리만 나도 놀라 깨이고 하였습니다. 그러는 동안에 변비에 걸리고 밥맛이 없어지는 一方, 체중이 기막히게 줄어들었습니다. 그 뿐만 아니라 밥을 먹은 후에 구역질이 나는데는 참말 혼났습니다. 그때 우연히 某同僚의 勸함을 받어 복용하기 시작한 것이 『와까모도』입니다.
처음 몇일동안은 별로 이렇다는 효험도 느끼지 않었는데 복용을 繼續하는 동안에 便痛이 순조로워질 뿐아니라 식사로 점점 늘어갔습니다. 그래서 연따라 복용하였드니 머리가 명랑해지고 체중도 불어서 15貫에 달하게 되였습니다. 그와 동시에 조금도 피로를 느끼지 않게 되고 일에도 힘차게 정진하게 되었습니다.
그리하여 障害하든 것이 하나식 해소됨을 따라 위장병도 안전히 輕快하여 젔습니다. ＜77＞
