After the Fierce Battle   (Fr.) Victor Hugo

When the fierce battle ended and darkness fell upon tens of thousands of corpses,
The father, smiling and kind, brave, sat upon his horse,
Looking around the battlefield this way and that.
Following behind him was an attendant soldier, a single lancer,
A tall and brave man whom the father loved dearly.

In the deep darkness, a faint sound of breathing somewhere,
One of the defeated Spanish soldiers who had fled,
Shot and bleeding, fallen behind during the march, collapsed by the roadside,
Out of breath, pale, exhausted, half-dead.
Panting, he says, "Thirsty, thirsty, give me water, give me water."
The father, feeling pity, took the flask attached to his saddle,
And gave it to the loyal attendant soldier, saying,
"Give it, let the fallen soldier drink." <143>
As the attendant soldier bent down and brought his face close,
Suddenly, the injured, prone Spanish soldier
Quickly drew the pistol hidden at his waist,
Shouted a single cry, "Take this!" aimed straight and pulled the trigger.
Just missing, the bullet grazed his head, sending the father's hat flying,
Even the startled horse took a step back, but
The father simply uttered one word: "Leave it, let him drink." <144>
<143-144>

**Summary**

This article presents a Korean translation by Chu Yo-han of Victor Hugo's poem "Après la Bataille" (After the Battle). The poem depicts a compassionate father figure, a military leader, observing a battlefield after a fierce fight. He orders his attendant to give water to a wounded, defeated enemy soldier (Spanish). Despite the enemy soldier attempting to shoot him in return, the father insists the soldier be given the water. The poem highlights themes of mercy and humanity amidst the brutality of war. From a historical perspective, the publication of this poem in Korea in December 1941 is significant. Translated by Chu Yo-han, a prominent Korean intellectual, it presents a European perspective on compassion towards an enemy, contrasting sharply with the militaristic and nationalistic atmosphere promoted by Japan, especially in the month of the Pearl Harbor attack. Historians might find the choice of this specific poem and its publication during wartime Korea interesting, possibly indicating a subtle expression of universal human values or humanitarianism counter to the dominant propaganda.

激戰後   (佛)빅토르ㆍ유고

激戰은 끝나고 수만흔 주검에 어둠이 나릴 적
우슴도 상량한, 용감한 부친은 말우에 안즈사
싸움의 마당을 이리로 돌아다 보시다
그 뒤를 따르는 종졸은 槍騎兵 한 사람
키크고 勇敢해 부친이 몹시도 사랑한 사나이

어둠은 기픈데 어디서 히미한 숨소리,
패전해 다라난 스바냐 군사중 한 사람
총마자 피나고 행군에 떠러저 길까에 쓰러저
숨차고 파라케 질려서 반주검 된 사람
헐덕여 하는 말 「목말라, 목말라, 물주어, 물주어」
부친은 측은이 여기어 안장에 달렷든 술병을
충직한 종졸께 떼어서 주시며
「주어라, 너머진 병정을 마시게 하여라」＜143＞
종졸은 허리를 구부려 가까이 얼골을 다일 때
돌연, 상하야 업드린 스바냐 병정은
허리에 감촷든 권총을 어느새 빼어서
「바다라」 외마디 질르며 똑바로 견양해 당기니
자칫, 머리를 스치는 총알에 부친의 모자는 날리고
무심한 말까지 놀라서 뒷거름 첫스나
부친은 오직! 한 말슴 「두어라, 마시게 하여라」  ＜144＞
＜143-144＞
