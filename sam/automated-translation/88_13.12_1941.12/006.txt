【Overseas Confidential】America's Military Strength
						Samch'ŏlli Editorial Department

America's Army strength is as follows:
Last year: 250,000
By May this year: 1,222,000
Increasing to 1,545,000 this autumn.
Newly, armored divisions have been established, and six motorized divisions have been completed.

Aviation strength, which was 2,900 aircraft [Army] and 1,813 Navy aircraft, rapidly increased by May this year to 4,000 Army aircraft and 3,262 Navy aircraft.
Of course, this includes training aircraft, but anyway, the expansion plan aiming for 25,000 Army aircraft and 10,000 Navy aircraft is steadily progressing.
Among aviation personnel, pilots number 10,000 in the Army (3,350 last May) with 15,000 in training, and 4,100 in the Navy (3,000 last year) with 5,000 in training. This rapid expansion aims for 50,000 military aircraft, 100,000 pilots, and 700,000 total aviation personnel.

America's Military Expansion Costs and Aid to Britain Costs

America's military expansion cost is budgeted at 55 billion dollars (approximately 200 billion Yen in our currency), and the cost of arms aid to Britain is 7<30> billion dollars, to which another 5 billion dollars is said to be added.

America's Planned Aircraft Production for Next Year

America's planned aircraft production for June 1942 is a colossal plan for monthly production of 2,870 aircraft, 4,100 engines, and 4,000 propellers. The breakdown of the aircraft is as follows:
Army: Fighters 500 aircraft
Bombers 400 aircraft
Trainers 640 aircraft
Navy: Fighters 120 aircraft
Bombers 200 aircraft
Trainers 350 aircraft
Aid to Britain Military Aircraft (various types)
650 aircraft

Japanese Assets in America

Although the exact amount of assets Japan holds in America is unclear, it is estimated to exceed roughly 100 million dollars. Looking at occupations, there are 18,000 agricultural laborers, 13,000 in farming and livestock industries, 9,000 bank and company employees, 7,000 servants, and 5,000 goods sellers. Among them, in California, there is also Mr. Minami Rokuemon (南彌六衛氏), who employs 350 white people and Japanese nationals, manages a large farm of 2,000 chōbu (町步), and pays 200,000 dollars annually just in land rent.

Total Number of Japanese Persons in America

How many people from the mainland [Japan] are currently in America? Including Hawaii,
First Generation (Issei): 101,623 people
Second Generation (Nisei): Approximately 200,000 people
Totaling a large number of 300,000 people. The Second Generation refers to children born there, who generally hold citizenship. Looking at regional distribution:
Hawaii: First Generation 34,000 people,
Second Generation 120,000 people
Los Angeles: First Generation 28,000
Second Generation 22,000
San Francisco: First Generation 17,000
Second Generation 25,000
New York: First Generation 2,000
Second Generation 500 people <31>

**Summary**

Published on December 1, 1941, just before the Pearl Harbor attack, this article details the rapid expansion of the US military (Army and Air Force manpower, aircraft numbers, production targets) and its significant financial commitments, including aid to Britain. It also quantifies Japanese assets and the sizeable Japanese population (Issei and Nisei) residing in the US, particularly in Hawaii and California, mentioning specific occupations and even a large-scale Japanese farmer. From a Korean colonial history perspective, this article, published in a Korean magazine under Japanese rule, is interesting as it reflects the Japanese Empire's intelligence gathering and assessment of its impending adversary, the United States. It shows a keen interest in US war potential and the situation of the Japanese diaspora, likely viewed both as an asset and a potential vulnerability, all while being disseminated to a Korean readership shortly before the Pacific War erupted. Historians might find the specific figures ( troop numbers, production goals, population counts) and the timing significant for understanding Japanese pre-war perspectives and information dissemination within the empire.
