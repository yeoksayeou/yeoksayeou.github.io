**Body Text Translation:**
Our Japanese Empire has taken up the sword of justice and risen up to annihilate the hostile nations of the United States and Britain, which have exclusively committed violence and exploitation in East Asia for over 340 years. Thus, the loyal Imperial Army, Navy, and Air Force, having respectfully received the issuance of the Great Imperial Rescript [declaring war], immediately opened the gates of cannon fire for chastisement. Already, within three days of the war's start, they have achieved brilliant, repeated war results, crushing the US Pacific Fleet near Hawai'i and also the British Far East Fleet on the seas off Manila, making it impossible for them to rise again. Reports of great victories continue to pour in.

At this time, we, the 24 million populace of the Peninsula, must firmly maintain a stance of certain victory and devote our entire hearts and strength to service on the home front. To do so, we must, more than anything, place absolute trust in the administrative authorities and follow their guidance and orders. On the other hand, besides the donation of military supplies, absorption of public bonds, encouragement of savings, and contribution of labor, we must firmly uphold the Imperial Way Spirit (皇道精神) and ensure we do not fall prey to the enemy's ideological schemes. Indeed, a thousand years of happiness for Asia is dawning upon the heads of our one hundred million people; we earnestly hope that you will devote your utmost sincerity and serve the national policy (國策) with all your heart and strength.<5>

**Summary**

This article is a piece of Japanese wartime propaganda published shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor and the start of the Pacific War (referred to as the Great East Asia War). It celebrates the initial Japanese victories against the US and British navies and calls upon the Korean population ("Peninsular Populace") to fully support the Japanese war effort. This support includes absolute trust in the colonial authorities, material contributions (supplies, bonds, savings, labor), and adherence to the "Imperial Way Spirit" while resisting enemy propaganda. For historians, this text is a stark example of the propaganda directed at Koreans during the late colonial period, illustrating the demands for total mobilization, the rhetoric used to justify the war, and the expected role of the colonized population in supporting the Japanese Empire's expansionist aims. It highlights the pressure on Koreans to demonstrate loyalty and contribute to a war effort framed as bringing "happiness for Asia" under Japanese leadership.

이때에 我等二千四百萬 半島民衆은 必勝의 態勢를 堅持하고 銃後奉公에 全心力을 傾할것이니 그리함에는 我等은 무엇보다도 施政當局을 絶對信賴하여 그 指導와 命令을 遵行할지며 한편 軍需資材의 獻納, 公債消化, 貯蓄勵行, 勞力供出은 勿論은 皇道精神을 堅持하여 敵의 思想謀略에 陷하는 事 업기를期할것이다. 바야흐로 亞細亞千年의 幸福이 우리 一億國民의 頭上에 오는터이니 赤誠을다 하야 國策에 全心力 을 奉仕하기를 懇切히 바라노라.＜5＞
