**Summary**

This short article, primarily composed of image captions, documents Japan's entry into the Pacific War (termed the "Greater East Asia Holy War") in December 1941. It juxtaposes images of Japanese political and military authority (Diet session, Fleet Admiral Tōgō, Admiral Yamamoto), military action (bombing of Manila), and perceived enemy weakness (US anti-war protests, troop withdrawal) with scenes of mobilization within colonial Korea. Specifically, it highlights a large pro-war rally held in Keijō (Seoul) by the Korean Provisional Wartime Hōkokudan and a cultural event, a roundtable discussion with famous actors, hosted by the Samch'ŏlli magazine itself. For historians, the piece is interesting as it vividly illustrates the immediate propaganda efforts undertaken in Korea following the outbreak of the Pacific War, showcasing the mobilization of Korean organizations like the Hōkokudan and the co-option of cultural figures (actors Mun Ye-bong, Chi Kyŏng-sun, Kim Sin-jae, and writer Ch'oe Chŏng-hŭi associated with the magazine) to rally public support for Japan's war against the US and Britain. It reflects the colonial state's drive for "unity" (一致結束) and manufactured "enthusiasm" (情熱) among Koreans for the war effort.
