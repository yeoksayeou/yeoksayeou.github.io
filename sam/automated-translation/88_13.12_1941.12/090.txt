Roundtable Discussion with Lead Actresses from Masterpiece Films
Attendees (in alphabetical order by surname initial) Kim Soyŏng
Kim Sinjae
Mun Yebong
Chi Kyŏngsun
Our Company's Side: Ch'oe Chŏnghŭi
Date: November 23rd, Place: Kimch'ŏndae Hall (金千代會館)

The place is Kimch'ŏndae Hall.
The time is dusk.

People coming for dinner, people coming to attend some meeting; the hall is quite bustling, and the hostesses are very busy.
At this time, I, along with Miss Chi Kyŏngsun and Miss Mun Yebong, arranged to rent a room on the 3rd floor to have dinner together. (Actually, I had intended to host Miss Kim Soyŏng and Miss Kim Sinjae as well, but those two were a bit late.) However, although this wasn't the case before, apparently, starting just recently, they won't guide you to a room until all the dinner guests have arrived. So, we had no choice but to wait for the other two near the entrance, and it caused quite a commotion. Firstly, everyone coming and going stopped in their tracks, eyes wide, but more than that, the hostesses from the hall, people working on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th floors, bellboys, elevator girls, cooks – everyone without exception – gathered around.
Realizing this wouldn't do, one of the hostesses led us out from the surrounding crowd and guided us to the coziest room available.
Having settled comfortably in the room, Kyŏngsun and Yebong seemed not yet finished with the conversation they were having outside. The two share the same hometown, Hamhŭng, have been close since childhood, and walk the same path, so their friendship remains unchanged to this day, they say. <78>

Husbands, Children, and Housekeeping
Kyŏngsun - "I heard you moved into a really magnificent house."
Yebong - "What's so magnificent about it?"
Kyŏngsun - "It's in Ch'angdong, right?"
Yebong - "Yes."
Kyŏngsun - "Isn't it inconvenient?"
Yebong - "It's okay. It's about a ten-minute walk from the station, but there are quite a lot of people coming and going."
Kyŏngsun - "They say the house is really nice?"
Yebong - "Well, it has five rooms and about 200 p'yŏng of land. More than that, I like it because it's quiet and the air is good. I heard you moved too."
Kyŏngsun - "Yes. To Naengch'ŏnjŏng, but it's a tiny house, not even one-tenth the size of yours."
Yebong - "You must be happy though, making loads of money..."
Kyŏngsun - "Hey, who says I'm making good money?"
Yebong - "Getting a salary every month, how nice must that be."
Kyŏngsun - "Don't even mention it. Even receiving that salary, I'm always strapped for cash... I wish I could have some financial leeway just once... I think it would be better to receive a large sum all at once like you do..."
Yebong - "It's not like that either. Without a fixed income, I'm honestly always anxious. Even if money comes in sometimes..."
At this point, Miss Sinjae joined.
Sinjae - "Sorry I'm late."
Yebong - "Why were you so late?"
Sinjae - "My mother went out to look for kimchi ingredients and didn't come back quickly, so I couldn't possibly leave the baby alone."
Kyŏngsun - "Oh, I heard you had a son? Congratulations."
Sinjae - "Thank you. Miss Kyŏngsun, your son must have grown quite big too."
Just like when Yebong and Kyŏngsun first met earlier, they were busy for a while talking about their children, housekeeping, and the children's fathers.
Kyŏngsun - "Where is your home now?"
Sinjae - "Chongno 5-ch'ŏmme. I moved just a little while ago."
Kyŏngsun - "Everyone seems to move frequently."
Yebong - "It's because we're poor, what else? Living in someone else's house, you move because the house is sold, then you move because you don't like it over there, moving for this reason and that... We plan to live permanently in Ch'angdong now."
The conversation paused for a moment. Miss Kyŏngsun looked at Miss Sinjae for a long time, then,
Kyŏngsun - "Somehow, Miss Sinjae, you don't look like a mother."
Yebong - "You could pass for nineteen..."
Kyŏngsun - "Even younger than that..."
Sinjae - "I don't know why I look so young. Even when we moved recently, the neighbor came over, and when I said I had two young children, they were utterly shocked. They thought I was fourteen or fifteen from 'Housekeeping Angel' (집업는 天使)... Oh, I heard Mr. Im Sŏn'gyu went on a Holy Land Pilgrimage (聖地 參拜)?"
Yebong - "Yes..."
Kyŏngsun - "It must be a bit lonely these days..."
Yebong - "What, is it only now that I'm alone? He's a gentleman who's always <79> traveling... It's because he's writing a script... He said he's coming back soon this time. On the 29th... When is Mr. Ch'oe In'gyu coming back?"
"I don't know for sure yet. He said he's going via Mudanjiang and touring around that area up to Xinjing."
Yebong - "Oh, you (addressing Miss Kyŏngsun), is your children's father (Mr. Chŏn Tongmin) home these days?"
Kyŏngsun - "Yes, he's home these days, but he's always battling with books..."

Here, Miss Kim Soyŏng also joined.
Kyŏngsun - "I heard you went to Tokyo..."
Soyŏng - "Yes. I arrived yesterday evening. I went this time because of Mr. Cho T'aegwŏn's matter."
Reporter - "Did Mr. Cho T'aegwŏn hold a dance performance (舞踊公演) there?"
Soyŏng - "No, he went to bring back dancers for regional performances (地方公演) around early December."
Yebong - "So, did you bring them back?"
Soyŏng - "We only brought back one woman from there, someone named Ishigaki Hatsue (石かき初枝)."

Korean Cinema and Film People
Reporter - "Are there any Korean film plans these days?"
Yebong - "It doesn't seem like there's much."
Kyŏngsun - "Didn't they say they'll only distribute enough film to make four movies a year?"
Sinjae - "That's what I heard."
Yebong - "Do four Korean films even come out in a year..."
Reporter - "Is it because there's no money?"
Soyŏng - "Well, I heard Choyŏng (朝映 - Korean Film Production Co.) will soon be creating something called 'Aoge Taejo' (仰げ大空)..."
Yebong - "It seems like people don't have the intention to work together, but are just full of useless ambition. If I say this, people might say Mun Yebong has become arrogant, but participating briefly in the making of 'Kimi to Boku' (君と僕), it goes without saying that there's much we need to learn, but I realized just how many bad habits we need to discard. When I went to Tokyo and first met Director Tasaka Tomotaka (田坂具陸監督) and greeted him, the very first thing he said was that the worst thing about Korean filmmakers is how they badmouth each other. He said that if Korean cinema is to develop in the future, that needs to be fixed first. Hearing that, I don't know how red my face became."
Kyŏngsun - "Among people striving to build mutual cultivation, such things probably wouldn't happen."
Sinjae - "Perhaps they don't realize that badmouthing others affects their own dignity..."
Yebong - "It's because they don't know. And another bad thing is that seniors don't try to guide their juniors well! They like it when juniors come and fawn over them. If they don't, they curse them out. It would be better if the seniors had actually achieved something substantial before acting like that..."
Soyŏng - "Whatever anyone says, it's enough just to do one's own work sincerely."

'Ethics of a Wife' · Actor's Performance
Reporter - "Miss Chi Kyŏngsun, was 'Ethics of a Wife' (안해의 倫理) your first film?"
Kyŏngsun - "A long time ago, I appeared with Yebong in 'Changhwa Hongnyŏn jŏn' (장화홍련전). That was when I didn't know what movies <80> were."
Yebong - "Still, it seems like the time when we didn't know was actually better. The more you know, the worse it seems, the scarier it gets..."
Sinjae - "That's true. Still, Miss Chi Kyŏngsun, perhaps because you were on stage for a long time, you were very bold in front of the camera."
Soyŏng - "I only saw the last scene during the recording and couldn't see the rest, but people who saw it say it was excellent for a first time."
Yebong - "I haven't seen it."
Reporter - "What role did you play in 'Changhwa Hongnyŏn jŏn'?"
Kyŏngsun - "I played Hongnyŏn, Yebong was Changhwa... After that, I didn't appear in films at all until 'Ethics of a Wife,' and it was absolutely hilarious. The story of the film 'Ethics of a Wife' isn't particularly new, and judging by the title alone, it seems like the wife would be the main character driving the story, but it wasn't quite like that. Anyway, somehow it happened, I was dazed and finished without knowing what was what. Film is fundamentally different from theater, the mood doesn't carry over, so I couldn't get excited or passionate. It really felt like just acting (시바이 - shibai, Japanese for play/acting), so it felt bland. Theater isn't like that. When you get into it, you can act as if it's really happening."
Reporter - "Do you intend to continue appearing in films in the future?"
Kyŏngsun - "Well. I lack confidence. If someone wrote a script especially for me, I might consider it. I'd rather appear in films as someone with a unique character than as a beauty."
Yebong - "They say character actors have long careers, your ambition is quite something..."
Reporter - "Miss Sinjae, what kind of role would you like to play?"
Sinjae - "Me? Let's see. I'd like to try playing a cheerful girl or a young woman. I wonder how that would be. And also a very young girl of 15. A role like that with an okappa (bobbed hair). I want to do it, but I just don't have the confidence."
Kyŏngsun - "Is there anyone who has confidence?"
Sinjae - "Still, those who do well..."
Yebong - "People who have confidence don't improve further. That's their limit."
Kyŏngsun - "Whether one improves or not, it seems unlikely anyone would have confidence in their own acting. Until the day they die, won't they always think they are imperfect?"
Reporter - "Miss Kim Soyŏng, what kind of role would you like to play?"
Soyŏng - "I'd like to play the role of a young mother, but they don't assign me those."

'Kimi to Boku' and 'P'ungnyŏn'ga'
Reporter - "Miss Kim Sinjae, please tell us about when you went on location (로-케숀) for 'P'ungnyŏn'ga' (豊年歌)."
Sinjae - "The stories? There are many stories – how can I tell them all?"
Kyŏngsun - "Just summarize them. There was a preview screening, right?"
Sinjae - "Yes, there was." <81>
Reporter - "Do you all not watch each other's works?"
Kyŏngsun - "It's not that we don't watch, we can't. We can't because we go to the provinces, and even when in Seoul, we practice during the day and perform plays at night, so there's no time."
Reporter - "Miss Mun Yebong, haven't you seen it either?"
Yebong - "I haven't seen it."
Soyŏng - "I haven't seen it either."
Reporter - "I saw it at the preview. Where in Kangwŏn Province was that?"
Sinjae - "Yes. It's a place called Ch'ungju in Kangwŏn Province, there's no electricity either. We spent about twenty days using lamps. It poured rain when we went, which was terrible, but it poured when we came back too, so it was tough. Anyway, the 'P'ungnyŏn'ga' location shoot left me with memories I'll never forget in my lifetime. Perhaps the rain poured so much to leave such sad memories."
Kyŏngsun - "Oh, right, the baby passed away while you were away, didn't it?"
Sinjae - "Yes!"
Miss Sinjae tries hard not to let her expression change.
Reporter - "Let's talk about something interesting."
Sinjae - "I had no idea the baby was dying... But we had a lot of fun. The group included funny people like Pak Ch'anghyŏk, Tajawa (?) (田澤二), Tok Ŭngnin (獨銀麟), so we were laughing day and night, our mouths never closed. Especially Mr. Pak Ch'anghyŏk, he's so good at impressions, he makes you double over laughing. He mimics cat sounds so well that kittens wouldn't leave him alone. This person isn't just funny, he's also extremely dedicated to his work. He was in charge of progress, and while traveling back and forth to Seoul, one day he was injured in a taxi whose driver dozed off, his hands were all torn up, but despite that, he came down to the countryside the next day, even in the rain, with those hands."
Yebong - "When there are such dedicated people, it feels reassuring and good. In 'Kimi to Boku' this time, Mr. Sim Yŏng (沈影) was so dedicated. Even the Mainland people (內地人 - Japanese) thought he was very dependable (たのもしい - tanomoshii)."
Kyŏngsun - "Did you stay long in Tokyo for the filming (撮影) of 'Kimi to Boku' this time?"
Yebong - "Since I only appeared briefly, I came back right away. I did go twice, once for filming and once for a broadcast..."
Sinjae - "Miss Yebong was very good in 'Kimi to Boku'."
Soyŏng - "Yes, Miss Yebong is good. I looked so grotesque, I wanted to crawl into a hole if there was one. I look like a cripple..."
Reporter - "How about the others?"
Yebong - "The others were mostly good too, but Mr. Sim Yŏng was particularly good. Miss Soyŏng was okay too, but I think her expressions were too exaggerated. I wished she had been more cheerful. Like a schoolgirl..."
Reporter - "How was the compensation for the performers?"
Yebong - "It was less than for other films. They paid the Mainland performers and the performers from here equally. Those who appeared less were paid separately..."<82>
Kyŏngsun - "Who among the Mainland actors did you like?"
Yebong - "All of them, they were good. They all possessed dignity. And Asagiri Kyōko (朝霧鏡子), how could she be so kind and thoughtful?"
Soyŏng - "She's a woman who gets better the more you get to know her."
Kyŏngsun - "Yes, she seems like a truly feminine woman. Though I haven't met her in person..."
Sinjae - "I feel like I could have done better with her... In the end, due to circumstances, I couldn't do it, but when I played the role of Yi Paekhŭi (李白姬), Director Hika's (日夏監督) wife played the role of Asano Mieko (淺野美枝子), and she was so much taller than me, we just didn't match at all. Also, the role of Yi Paekhŭi was one that followed like a shadow, so it was subtly difficult."
Soyŏng - "That's right. That's why I became even stiffer and more rigid."
Kyŏngsun - "Indeed, it's true. Roles that follow silently are difficult."
Reporter - "Now, please critique each other's performances."
Sinjae - "I've only seen Miss Chi Kyŏngsun in 'Ethics of a Wife,' but you were very bold in it."
Yebong - "I haven't seen 'Ethics of a Wife,' so I have nothing to say."
Sinjae - "Miss Yebong, I feel I can watch you with ease. Even when you gave greetings on stage during the 'Kimi to Boku' preview, you were so composed, without any hesitation, not shy at all, you did so well. Someone like me would have turned red with embarrassment..."
Kyŏngsun - "That's right. Yebong seems confident in front of the camera. How should I put it, I think she has presence (貫祿)."
Reporter - "What about Miss Soyŏng's acting?"
Yebong - "In 'Spring of the Peninsula' too, I think Miss Soyŏng's acting was too exaggerated."
Soyŏng - "Please don't talk about me too much, I'm so embarrassed. I'm so embarrassed I even think about quitting the film industry, but I plan to keep studying, hoping to make just one good film before I stop."
Kyŏngsun - "Miss Soyŏng was very good in 'Border' (國境). I think roles like that will make Miss Soyŏng shine."
Soyŏng - "I want to do roles like that. Roles like schoolgirls or young women make my face flush and my expression naturally stiffens."
Reporter - "By the way, when you go on location and it rains, what do you do to pass the time?"
Sinjae - "During our 'P'ungnyŏn'ga' location shoot this time, we brought a ball, and on cloudy days, the technical department and the acting department split into two teams and had competitions."
Kyŏngsun - "What kind of competitions?"
Sinjae - "Baseball (뻬시·뽈 - beshiboru, from Japanese 'beisubōru')."
Yebong - "So, which side won?"
Sinjae - "Our acting department won more often. The acting department is quicker, somehow. But Mr. Pang Hanjun (方漢駿) whined so much that we nicknamed him 'Whiner'... And another funny thing is, the children there kill birds if they catch them. When we caught a baby bird and let it go because we felt sorry for it, they asked why we let go something that eats grain instead of killing it. The fact that they kill them is unpleasant, but the reason, 'because it eats grain,' was quite interesting."
Kyŏngsun - "A sentiment only village children would understand, I suppose."

'Spring of the Peninsula' and Others
Reporter - "'Did you see 'Spring of the Peninsula' (半島의봄)?"
Yebong - "Yes."
Kyŏngsun - "I haven't seen it." <83>
Sinjae - "I've seen it."
Reporter - "How was it? What are your critiques?"
Sinjae - "The cinematography is very clean."
Reporter - "The clouds appearing in it are quite good, aren't they? Clouds you wouldn't get tired of looking at for a long time. Aren't they clouds rarely seen even in Western films?"
Sinjae - "'Stagecoach' also has good clouds, clouds that make you feel like something is about to happen."
Reporter - "Isn't Sŏ Wŏryŏng's face good in 'Spring of the Peninsula'? And Kim Ilhae's face when he's lying in bed (빼-드 - beddo, from Japanese 'beddo') and learns the news from the newspaper that the film industry is doing well?"
Kyŏngsun - "I haven't seen it so I don't know, but Mr. Sŏ Wŏryŏng doesn't have a Korean face."
Sinjae - "He looks like a German soldier (獨逸兵丁)..."

Good Films and Good Actors
Reporter - "Among the films you've seen, what do you consider good?"
Yebong - "Do you mean among all the films I've seen throughout my life?"
Reporter - "Yes..."
Kyŏngsun - "It's hard to think of one suddenly."
Soyŏng - "'Unfinished Symphony' (未完成交響樂), 'The Blue Angel' (뿌룩극장 - perhaps referring to Der blaue Engel?) are films I could watch over and over."
Sinjae - "I think the films I saw before I knew anything about movies are better than the ones I've seen recently. Before I entered the film industry, I saw 'A Woman's Life' (어떤 女子의 一生) - I watched it without even knowing where it was from. After that, 'Ramona' (라모나). It was in Technicolor (天然色 寫眞), and it was so good, I want to see it again."
Yebong - "I can't really think of any..."
Reporter - "Which actresses do you like?"
Kyŏngsun - "Yebong will probably say Greta Garbo again. I like Bette Davis..."
Sinjae - "Her acting is good. They say she's the best even in the West.<84> Still, I prefer Jean Arthur or, as I mentioned earlier, Ann Harding, the actress from 'A Woman's Life'."
Soyŏng - "Zarah Leander is good too."
Reporter - "Who do you like among Mainland Japanese actresses?"
Kyŏngsun - "Tanaka Kinuyo (田中絹代), Yamada Isuzu (山田五十鈴) are good."
Sinjae - "I like Tanaka too. Other people look good or bad depending on the photo, but she always looks good."
Soyŏng - "I also like Tanaka and Yamada. By the way, I recently saw 'Sakura no Kuni' (櫻の國), and Takamine's performance in it is truly superb."
Kyŏngsun - "By the way, this is off-topic, but generally, film actors seem to be more popular than theater actors. Even though I do theater, I don't really know many famous European theater actors, but I generally know most famous film actors. And it might sound funny, but before appearing in 'Ethics of a Wife,' because I was always at the Tongyang Theater (東洋劇場), when I walked down the street, people would whisper, 'It's the Tongyang Theater.' But after appearing in 'Ethics of a Wife,' they whisper, 'It's 'Ethics of a Wife.''
Reporter - "Thank you for sharing many good stories. It's getting late, so let's conclude here." <85>

**Summary**

This 1941 roundtable discussion features four prominent Korean actresses (Kim Soyŏng, Kim Sinjae, Mun Yebong, Chi Kyŏngsun) discussing their lives, work, and the state of Korean cinema under Japanese rule. They talk candidly about personal matters like moving houses, finances, and raising children, contrasting the stability of salaried work (like Chi Kyŏngsun's theater contract) with the insecurity of freelance film work (Mun Yebong). They critique each other's performances, discuss preferred roles, share anecdotes from film shoots (like Kim Sinjae's difficult 'P'ungnyŏn'ga' location shoot), and comment on the challenges facing the Korean film industry, including funding issues, perceived lack of professionalism (criticizing gossip among filmmakers), and comparisons with the Japanese film industry (referring to Japanese actors and directors). They also name their favorite international and Japanese actresses.

From a historical perspective, the article offers insights into the colonial cultural milieu. The casual references to travel to Tokyo, working with Japanese directors and actors (like Tasaka Tomotaka, Asagiri Kyōko), using Japanese terms (like 'shibai', 'tanomoshii', 'beshiboru', 'beddo'), and discussing Japanese films ('Kimi to Boku', 'Sakura no Kuni') highlight the pervasive Japanese influence. Mun Yebong's mention of a Japanese director criticizing Korean filmmakers' tendency to badmouth each other, and the discussion about the potential restriction of film stock ("only distribute enough film to make four movies a year"), hint at both internal industry issues and the controlling colonial cultural policies impacting Korean cinema production during wartime. The reference to Im Sŏn'gyu's "Holy Land Pilgrimage" (聖地 參拜), likely meaning a trip to Japan (often used metaphorically for Japan proper during this period), further underscores the colonial power dynamic.

名作映畵主演 女俳優座談會
出席者 (가나다順) 金素英
金信哉
文藝峰
池京順
本社側 崔貞熙,
時日  11月23日, 場所  金千代會館
장소는 金千代會館.
때는 해질므렵이다.

저녁먹으러 오는 사람, 무슨 會合에 참석하려 오는 사람, 회관안은 제법 흥성하고 접대하는 여자들도 매우 분주하다.
이때 나는 우리의 池京順, 文藝峯 두분과 함께 3층 어느 방 하나를 빌려 저녁을 같이 나누기로 했다.(사실은 金素英씨와 金信哉씨까지 세분을 모시고저 했든 것인데 두분은 좀 느젔다.) 그런데 전에는 그러한 일이 없드니 요얼마전부터는 저녁 먹을 손님이 다 오기전엔 방에 안내를 안해준다는 것이다. 그래서 우리는 하는 수 없이 현관입구에서 두분이 오시기를 기다리게 되는데 큰 야단이났다. 드나드는 사람마다 한번씩 발을 멈추고 눈이 휘둥그래지는 것은 둘재로, 위선, 회관에서 접대하는 여자들과 1,2,3,4,5,6층에서 일보는 사람, 뽀-이, 엘레베-타, 껄, 쿡, 할 것 없이 쭉- 둘러싼다.
이래선 안될 것을 알었던지 접대인 하나가 우리를 사람 둘러선 속에서 빼여내 第一 아담한 방 하나에 안내해 준다.
방에 안윽히 자리를 잡은 京順, 藝峯은 밖에서 하든 이얘기의 끝을 아즉 못 맺은 모양이다. 두분은 고향이 같은 咸興으로 어릴쩍부터 친밀했든 것이고 또 똑같은 길을 걷고 있음으로 오늘까지 그 우정은 조금도 변하지 않었다 한다.＜78＞

남편과 애기와 살림과
京順 - 「너 아주 훌융한 집에 이살했다드구나.」
藝峯 - 「뭐가 훌융해.」
京順 - 「倉洞이래지?」
藝峯 - 「그래.」
京順 - 「불편하잖어?」
藝峯 - 「괜찮어. 驛에서 한 십분가량 걷지만 來往하는 사람들이 퍽많어서.」
京順 - 「집이 퍽 좋대지?」
藝峯 - 「뭐 방이 다섯이구 땅이 한 200평 된대. 그보다두 조용하구 공기가 좋아서 좋와. 너두 들으니까 이사했다드구나.」
京順 - 「응. 泠泉町으루하는데 너이집 10분의 1두 못되는 조그마한집이란다.」
藝峯 - 「넌 그래도 졸거야 돈을 막 버니까.. 」
京順 - 「얜 누가 돈을 잘버는데그래.」
藝峯 - 「매달 월급을 타니 얼마나 좋겠니.」
京順 - 「얘 말마라 월급이란 고거 받는대두 밤낮 쪼들리는거... 한번 餘裕가 있어보았음 좋겠어... 너처럼 한꺼번에 얼마씩 큰돈을 받음 날 것 같아...」
藝峯 - 「그렇지두 않어 고정된 수입이 없으니까 참 늘 불안하다니까. 생길땐 생긴다해두... 」
여기까지 왔을 때 信哉氏가 참석.
信哉 - 「늦어서 미안합니다.」
藝峯 - 「웨 그렇게 느지셨어요.」
京順 - 「어머니가 김장감 보시려 나가셨는데 얼는 안들어시니 어린앨 혼자두고 나올 수 있어야죠.」
京順 - 「참 아드님 나셨다구요? 축하합니다.」
信哉 - 「고맙습니다. 京順氏두 아드님 퍽 컸겠군요.」
그들은 아까 藝峯·京順 두분이 처음 만났을 때처럼 서로 아이들 이얘기 살님 이얘기 아이아버지 얘기로 한참 바쁘다.」
京順 - 「지금 댁은 어디십니까.」
信哉 - 「鍾路 5丁目입니다. 요 얼마전에 이살했어요.」
京順 - 「모두들 이사는 자주하는군요.」
藝峯 - 「가난뱅이들이니까 그렇지 뭐야, 남의 집에 있으니 집이 팔려 이살해 또 이 쪽에서 마음에 안맞어 이살해, 이래 저래 이살하게 되니까... . 우린 인제 倉洞서 영구히 살작정이야.」
얼마간 이얘기가 끊어 젔다. 京順氏 信哉氏를 한참동안 보고 있다가,
京順 - 「아무래두 信哉씬 애기엄마 같잖아요.」
藝峯 - 「한 열아홉쯤 된대두 좋겠지... .」
京順 - 「그보다두 더 어리셔... 」
信哉 - 「왜 그리 어려뵈는지 몰라요. 요전 이사같을 때두 그 옆집 사람이 와서 제가 어린애가 둘채랬드니 깜짝 놀래는군요. 「집업는 天使」에서 열넷이나 다섯된 여자루 알었다나요... . 참 林仙圭氏가 聖地 參拜를 가셨다지요.」
藝峯 - 「네... ... 」
京順 - 「요샌 좀 적적하겠군... 」
藝峯 - 「뭐 인재만 혼자있나, 늘 돌아다니는＜79＞ 양반인데...  각본을 쓰느라 그래...  이번엔 곧 오신대. 29일에... 崔寅圭씬 언제쯤 오시나요?」
아직 잘 몰르겠어요. 목단강으루해서 新京 그쪽까지 쭉 둘러오신다니까.」
藝峯 - 「참 너(京順씨를 向하야) 아이 아버진(全東民氏) 요새 집에 게시냐?」
京順 - 「그래 요샌 집에 있는데 밤낮 책과만 싸움이지... 」

여기에 또 金素英氏가 끼이게 되셨다.
京順 - 「동경가셨다드니... .」
素英 - 「네. 어쩌녁에 왔어요. 이번엔 趙(澤元氏)일루 해서 갔댔으니까요.」
記者 - 「趙澤元氏가 게 가셔서 舞踊公演을 하셨든가요.」
素英 - 「안요, 12월 초순경에, 지방공연을 하려고 舞踊家 데리려 갔댔죠.」
藝峯 - 「그래 데려오셨어요.」
素英 - 「거기가선 여자 한분만 데려왔어요, 石かき初枝라는 이를.」

朝鮮映畵와 映畵人
記者 - 「요새 朝鮮映畵計劃하는거 있습니까.」
藝峯 - 「뭐 별루 있는 것 같잖아요.」
京順 - 「필림을 1년에 네 개 만들 것 밖에 배급 안한다지?.」
信哉 - 「그런다나봐요.」
藝峯 - 「조선영화가 1년에 네 개가 나오기나 하나... 」
記者 - 「돈이 없어 그런가요.」
素英 - 「글세요, 朝映서「「仰げ大空」」라는 걸 近近創作한다드구만... .」
藝峯 - 「서루들 일을 해보겠단 생각은 없구 쓸데없는 야심만 많아서 그런 것 같아요. 이렇게 말하면 文藝峯이가 건방저젔다구 말들하겠지만 이번 「「君と僕」」를 만드는데 잠깐 참레해보니까 우리가 배워야할 것이 많은 것은 말할 것도 없지만 버려야할 나쁜 버릇이 어떻게 많은지 몰나요, 東京 가서 田坂具陸監督을 처음 만나 인사를 하고 난 즉 그분이 제일 먼저하는 말이 조선영화인들의 가장 나쁜 것은 서루 영화인끼리 험담하는 것이라구요. 조선영화가 앞으루 발전 하려면 그것부터 곤처야한다구요. 그 말을 들을 때 어떻게 얼굴이 붉어젔는지 몰라요.」
京順 - 「피차에 교양을 쌓아보자구 노력하는 사람들 사이엔 그런 일이 없을거야.」
信哉 - 「남의 험담하는 것이 자기 체면에 관게되는 걸 몰라서 그럴까... .」
藝峯 - 「그걸 모르니까 그렇지. 그리구 또 한가지 안된 건 선배들이 후진을 잘 지도해 주려구 안하는 거야! 후진들이 자기들한태 와서 꿉실꿉실해야 좋와하구. 그렇지 않으면 욕들을 하니 선배라구 뭐 버젔이 해논거나 있어가지구 그랬음 좋지... .」
素英 - 「뭐니 뭐니 할것없이 제 할 일만 성의 껏하면 그만이죠.」

「안해의 倫理」·俳優의 演技
記者 - 「池京順氏 映畵는 「「안해의 倫理」」가 처음이시지요?」
京順 - 「그-전에 「「장화홍련전」」에 藝峯이와 같이 나왔지요. 그땐 영화가 뭔지＜80＞ 모르든때였어요.」
藝峯 - 「그래두 모르는 때가 오히려 좋왔든 것 같아. 알면 알사룩 더 못한 것 같아 더 무서워... 」
信哉 - 「그건 그래요. 그래두 池京順씬, 역시 무대에 오래 게시던만큼 카메라앞에 아주 대담하시든데요.」
素英 - 「저두 녹음할 때 라스트씬만 보구 못 봤는데 본 사람들 얘길 드르면 처음으루선 훌융하다구 그래요.」
藝峯 - 「난 못봤서.」
記者 - 「장화홍연전」에 뭘루 나오셨든가요?」
京順 - 「홍영이루 나왔죠, 藝峯이가 장화구...  그리군 그 동안 영화엔 통 안나오다가 「안해의 倫理」에 나왔는데 아주 우수워 죽을 지경이였어요. 「안해의 倫理」라는 영화의 이얘기가 별로 새로운 것두 아니구, 그 제목만 본다면 안해가 주로 이얘길 끌구 나갈 것같이 되있지만 그렇지두 못하고, 어쨌든 어떻게 됐는지 어리펑펑해서 뭐가 어떻게 되는 건지 모르구 끝을 막었는데 도대체 영화는 연극과 달라서 기분이 연장 안되기 때문에, 흥이 안나고 열이 안나두군요, 정말 시바이를 하는 것 같아서 싱겁드군요. 연극은 그렇찮어요. 신이 날 땐 정말 현실인양 하게 되니까요.」
記者 - 「앞으루두 영화에 게속해서 나오시렵니까?」
京順 - 「글세요. 자신이 없어서요, 저를 위해 특별히 각본을 써준다면 할 생각두 없잖어요. 전 영화에 미인으루 나오기보다 독특한 성격을 가진 사람으로 나왔으면 싶어요.」
藝峯 - 「성격배운 생명이 길다는데, 너 野心이 여간아니구나... 」
記者 - 「信哉씬 어떤 役을 했으면 싶으세요?」
信哉 - 「저요, 글세요. 전 명랑한 소녀나 혹은 처녀역을 해보구 싶은데요. 어떨넌지 그리고 아주 어린 15才의 소녀. 오까빠한 그런 役두 해보구 싶어요. 하군 싶지만 웬체 자신이 없어서요.」
京順 - 「자신을 가질 사람이 있을까요.」
信哉 - 「그래두 웨 잘하는 사람들이야... 」
藝峯 - 「자신을 갖는 사람은 더 늘지 못해요. 거기서 마지막이얘요.」
京順 - 「느나, 주나간에 자기연기에 자신을 갖는 사람이란 있을 것 같잖아. 죽는 날까지 늘 자기가 불완전하다고 생각하지 않을까.」
記者 - 「金素英씬 어떤 役을 하시구 싶으세요?」
素英 - 「젊은 어머니役이 하구 싶은데 그런 건 안시키는군요.」

「君と僕」와 「豊年歌」
記者 - 「金信哉씨 『豊年歌』로-케숀 가셨을 때 이얘기 좀 하세요.」
信哉 - 「이얘기요, 이얘긴 많은데- 그걸 어떻게 다해요.」
京順 - 「추려서 하지요. 시사회가 있었다지요?」
信哉 - 「네. 있었어요.」＜81＞
記者 - 「여러분은 서루 출연한 작품을 안보시나요?」
京順 - 「안보는 거 아니라 못보지요, 지방에 가느라 못보구 서울있어두 낮엔 연습을 하구 밤엔 연극을 하니 시간이 있어야지요.」
記者 - 「文藝峯氏두 못보셨든가요?」
藝峯 - 「못봤어요.」
素英 - 「저두 못봤어요.」
記者 - 「전 시사회때 봤는데 그게 강원도 어디라지요?」
信哉 - 「네. 강원도 충주라는 땅인데, 전기불두 없어요, 한 스므날 동안 람푸를 켜구들 지냈어요. 갈 적에두 비가 아주 막 쏟아저서 혼이 났지만 올적에두 비가 쏟아저서 고생이였어요, 어쨌든 『豊年歌』로-케숀은 내 일생을 통해서 못잊을 기억을 남겨놨어요. 그런 슬픈 기억을 남겨줄려구 비가 그렇게 쏟아졌든가봐요.
京順 - 「참, 애기가 엄마 안게실 때 그렇게 됐다죠.」
信哉 - 「네!」
信哉氏 얼굴빛을 달리 안가질려고 노력한다.
記者 - 「재미있든 이얘기나 하십시다.」
信哉 - 「전 애기가 죽는 건 통 모르구... 그렇지만 재민 무척 있었에요, 一行에 朴昌赫, 田澤二, 獨銀麟氏 등 재미있는 분들이 게셔서 밤낮 웃기에 입담을 새가 없었지요. 中에두 朴昌赫氏는 어떻게 흉낼 잘내는지 허리를 못펴게 하는군요. 괭이소리를 신통하게 내기 떄문에 괭이 새끼가 떠러 안지는군요. 이 분은 웃기기만 할 뿐아니라, 일에두 몹시 열심이얘요, 진행을 밫는데 서울루 왔다갔다 하느라구 어느날은 운전수가 졸르는 택씨를 탓다가 負傷을 당해서 손이 모다 찌저지구 했는데 그 손을 가지구 비오는데두 불구하구 이튼날 싀곧루 내려오셨드라니까.」
藝峯 - 「그런 열심있는 분들이 있으면 괜이 맘이 듬즉해서 좋와요. 이번 『君と僕』에서 沈影氏가 그렇게 열심이군요, 內地人들두 퍽 다노모시이하다구 생각하드군요.」
京順 - 「너 이번 『君と僕』 撮影 때문에 東京가서 오레있었니?」
藝峯 - 「난 잠깐 나오니까, 이내 왔어 가긴 두 번 갔댔지, 촬영하러 갔댔구 방송하러 갔댔구...」
信哉 - 「『君と僕』에 藝峯氏가 퍽 좋드군요.」
素英 - 「그래 藝峯씬 좋와요. 난 너무 흉칙해서 쥐구녕이래두 있음 쏙 들어가구 싶어 꼭 병신 같다니까...」
記者 - 「다른 분들은 어때요?」
藝峯 - 「다른 분들두 대개 다 좋지만 沈影氏가 퍽 좋와요. 素英氏두 괜찮은데 너무 지나친 표정을 한 것 같아요. 좀더 명랑했으면 싶었어요. 여학생처럼....」
記者 - 「출연자의 보수는 어떻게 됐지요.」
藝峯 - 「다른 영화에 보다는 적었에요. 內地 분들이나 여기서 출연한 사람이나 균일하게 주드군요, 적게 출연한 사람은 따루하구요....」＜82＞
京順 - 「內地出演俳優들 중 누가 좋든?」
藝峯 - 「다, 좋와, 모두 품격을 가추구 있어. 그리구 朝霧鏡子는 어쩌면 그렇게 상양하구자상할까.」
素英 - 「사괼수록 더 좋은 여자두군요.」
京順 - 「참 그분, 여자다운 여자같드군요. 실물은 못봤어두...」
信哉 - 「난 그이 하구라면 좀더 잘했을 것 같어... 결국 사정이 있어서 못하구 마렀지만 내가 李白姬役을 할땐 日夏감독의 부인이 淺野美枝子役을 했는데 그분이 키가 나보다 여간 크지 않어서 도모지 나와는 얼리지 않는군 그래. 또 李白姬役이 그림자 같이 따라다니는 役이길래 슬그머니 어려워요.」
素英 - 「그래요. 그러기 때문에 더 뻣뻣이 굳어젔다니까.」
京順 - 「하긴 그래요. 말없이 따라다니는 役이 어렵지요.」
記者 - 「인제 세분이 서루의 연기비평들 하십시오.」
信哉 - 「池京順씬 『안해의 倫理』에서 밖에 못보았는데요. 『안해의 倫理』에서 퍽 대담하십데다.」
藝峯 - 「난 『안해의 倫理』를 못봣으니 할 말이 없군요.」
信哉 - 「藝峯씬 마음 놓구 봐두 괜찮을 것 같아요. 이번 『君と僕』 시사회때 무대에서 인사하실때두 참 침착하게 조금두 서슴지않구, 붓그러워두 안하시구 잘하시드군요, 우리 같으면 붓그러워 얼굴이 빨개젔을텐데....」
京順 - 「그래요. 藝峯은 카메라 앞에 자신이 있는 것 같아요. 뭐랄까요, 貫祿을 가젔다구 봐요.」
記者 - 「素英씨의 연기는 어떳습니까.」
藝峯 - 「반도의 봄에서두 素英씬 너무 지나친 연기를 했다구봐요.」
素英 - 「너무 작구들 얘기 말어주세요, 붓그러죽겠어요, 너무 붓그러서 영화계에서 발을 빼고 싶은 생각까지두 나지만 단 한 개라라두 존걸 맨들구 그만둘려고 그냥 공불할려고 생각하구 있어요.」
京順 - 「素英씬 『國境』이 퍽 좋왔어요. 그런 役이 素英씰 살릴거라구봐요.」
素英 - 「그런 役은 하구 싶어요. 여학생이라든지 처녀역은 얼굴이 뜨근뜨근해지며 자연 표정이 굳어지는군요.」
記者 - 「그런데 로-케숀을 가서 비오든지하는 때면 뭣들하구 지내는가요?」
信哉 - 「우린 이번 『豊年歌』로-케숀 땐 공을 가지구 가서 흐린 날엔 기술부와 연기부 두패가 나누워 시합을 했어요.」
京順 - 「무슨 시합을요?」
信哉 - 「뻬시·뽈이요.」
藝峯 - 「그래 어느 편이 이겼나요?」
信哉 - 「우리 연기부가 더 많이 이겼어요. 아무래두 연기부가 빠리 빠리하거든요, 그런데 方漢駿氏가 어떻게 떼를 쓰는지 우리가 떼쟁이라구 별명을 지었다우... 그리구 또 한가지 재미있는건 거기 애들은 새를 잡으면 죽여버려요, 우리가 새색끼를 잡았다가 불상해서 노아주면 웨 곡식을 먹는 걸 잡아죽이지 않고 노아주느냐는 거얘요. 죽인다는 사실은 싫지만 곡식을 먹는다고 죽이라는 말은 퍽 재미있었어요.」
京順 - 「시골애들이 아니면 모를 감정이군요.」

「半島의봄」과 其他 記者 - 「『半島의 봄』을 보셨어요.』
藝峯 - 「네」
京順 - 「전 못봣는데요.」＜83＞
信哉 - 「전 봣어요.」
記者 - 「어때요? 評들을 하신다면?」
信哉 - 「화면이 퍽 깨끗하지요.」
記者 - 「거기 나오는 구름이 퍽 좋드군요. 오-래봐두 싫지 안을 구름이드는군요. 서양영화에서두 별루 못 보는 구름이 아닐까요.」
信哉 - 「驛馬車에두 좋은 구름이 있지요, 무슨 일이 금방 터질 것 같은 구름이.」
記者 - 「『半島의봄』에 徐月影氏 얼굴이 좋지 않어요? 金一海 氏의 빼-드에 누어 영화계가 잘되어가리라는 신문의 소식을 알었을 때의 얼굴두 좋구요?」京順 - 「전 안 봐서 모르지만 徐月影氏는 朝鮮 사람의 얼굴이 안얘요.」
信哉 - 「獨逸兵丁과 같은 얼굴이야....」

좋은 映畵와 좋은 俳優
記者 - 「보신 중에서 좋다구 생각하는 영화가 무엇입니까.」
藝峯 - 「일생을 통해서 봐온 것중에서 말입니까?」
記者 - 「네....」
京順 - 「갑잭이 생각이 잘 안 나는군요.」
素英 - 「『未完成交響樂』 『뿌룩극장』같은 건 늘 봐두 좋겠어요.」
信哉 - 「난 요새 본 것보다 전에 영화를 모를 때 본 것이 좋다구 생각돼요. 영화계에 들어오기 전인데 『어떤 女子의 一生』인데 어디메 것인지두 모르구 봣어요. 그 담엔 『라모나』얘요, 天然色 寫眞인데 어떻게 좋든지 다시 보고 싶구만요.」
藝峯 - 「난 별루 생각나는 거 없는 걸....」
記者 - 「여배우는 누구를 좋와들 하십니까.」
京順 - 「藝峯인 또 그레이다, 가르보겠군. 난 베테·데비쓰가 좋드군요...」
信哉 - 「연긴 좋지요. 서양에서도 제일＜84＞이라니까. 그래도 난 그보다 징·아-사나 아까말한 『어떤 女子의 一生』에 나왔든 앙·카-데잉이란 여배우가 좋와요.」
素英 - 「쓰아라·렌다두 좋지요.」
記者 - 「內地 여배우 중엔 누가 좋습니까.」
京順 - 「田中絹代, 山田50鈴가 좋지요.」
信哉 - 「나두 田中가 좋와요. 다른 사람들은 사진에 따라 좋왔다 싫었다 하지만 그이만은 늘 좋와요.」
素英 - 「나두 田中, 山田가 좋와요. 그런데 이번에『櫻の國』를 봣는데 거기 나오는 高峯의 연기가 아주 훌융해요.」
京順 - 「그런데 이건 딴 말이지만, 대체루 연극배우보다 영화배우가 인기가 있는 것 같아요, 난 연극을 하면서두 歐羅巴 연극 배우는 유명한 사람이래두 별루 모르는데 영화배우는 유명하면 대개 다 알거든요. 그리구 우수운 얘기 같지만 『안해의 倫理』에 출연하기 전엔 동양극장에 늘 있는 관계루 거리를 걸을려면 『東洋劇場이다.』하구 쑤군대드니 『안해의 倫理』에 나온 후엔 『안해의 倫理』다 하구 쑤군들대는군요.
記者 - 「좋은 말씀 많이 들었어요. 시간두 느꾸한데 인제 그만둡시다.」 ＜85＞
