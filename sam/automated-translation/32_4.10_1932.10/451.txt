Urgent Notice

The first issue of our company's new magazine, Man'guk Puin (萬國婦人), is currently on sale amidst great acclaim. Please read it fondly along with Samch'ŏlli.

We are recruiting extensively for regional branch offices for Man'guk Puin (萬國婦人) and Samch'ŏlli (三千里). Interested individuals, please request the branch office regulations.<100>

**Summary**

This brief announcement promotes the newly launched magazine "Man'guk Puin" (World Women), published by the company behind "Samch'ŏlli". It highlights the positive reception of the first issue and encourages readers to purchase both magazines. Additionally, it serves as a recruitment advertisement, seeking individuals interested in establishing regional branch offices for both publications. From a historical perspective, this notice shows a publishing house attempting to expand its reach, potentially targeting a female readership with the new magazine, and utilizing a regional branch network model for distribution and sales during the Japanese colonial period. This reflects both commercial ambition and the structure of business operations at the time.
