Chronicles of Beauties

Chŏng Chong-myŏng's Vegetable Poisoning (鄭鍾鳴의 菜毒)
Chŏng Chong-myŏng of the Kŭnhuhoe (槿友會), famous for being even more spirited than men, had lunch with Mr. U Pong-un (禹鳳雲氏) at the Kŭnhuhoe Hall (槿友會舘). The kimchi they ate then was bad, and she got vegetable poisoning (菜毒). At that time, on the Kŭnhuhoe Hall signboard (看板), it was written in Ms. Chŏng's own hand (親筆), "U Pong-un and Chŏng Chong-myŏng have gotten vegetable poisoning (菜毒), so any interested person (有志者), please buy some meat and bring it." For vegetable poisoning (菜毒), one must eat meat... um... this happened last summer.

Ms. Hwang Sin-dŏk's Vegetable Poisoning (黃信德씨의 菜毒)
Since the topic of vegetable poisoning (菜毒) came up, let's tell one more story. This is not last year, but this summer's event. Ms. Hwang Sin-dŏk (黃信德女史), who is engrossed in taking care of household matters outside Tongdaemun (東大門), suffered for several months this year due to vegetable poisoning (菜毒) from cabbage she dug up and ate from her vegetable garden. Vegetable poisoning (菜毒) is truly an accursed thing (厄物) for beauties (佳人)!

Writer Kang Kyŏng-ae's Return to Kando (姜敬愛女史의 歸間)
The newly emerged female novelist, Ms. Kang Kyŏng-ae (姜敬愛女史), who had come up <47> to Seoul for treatment due to illness (病), has now returned to Kando (間島) and is resuming her writing (筆硯). It is said that she will soon commence (着手) a great work set against the background (背景) of the 400,000 compatriots (同胞) in Kando.

Hanyang, Gathering Place of Beauties (佳人渭集의 漢陽)
Miss Song Kye-wŏl (宋桂月孃), who had been taking leisurely (閑暇) strolls (散步) by the East Sea (東海) coast for a long time due to illness (病), returned to her old home (舊巢) in Hanyang (漢陽) riding the cool autumn breeze. Now, even the female poet (女詩人) Mo Yun-suk (毛允淑), who had been teaching (敎鞭 잡고 잇든) at Kando Girls' High School (間島女高), has come up to the capital (上京). This autumn, Hanyang Fortress (漢陽城) is experiencing a bountiful harvest of beauties (佳人登豊). <48>

**Summary**

This article provides short news updates on several prominent Korean women in 1932. Chŏng Chong-myŏng and Hwang Sin-dŏk both suffered from food poisoning caused by vegetables ("vegetable poisoning"). Novelist Kang Kyŏng-ae returned to Kando after receiving medical treatment in Seoul and plans to write a major novel about the Korean community there. Song Kye-wŏl returned to Seoul (Hanyang) after recovering from an illness by the sea, and poet Mo Yun-suk also arrived in Seoul from Kando, leading the author to comment on the abundance of talented women ("beauties") gathering in the capital.

For historians, the article offers insights into the lives of educated, active Korean women (often called 'New Women') during the colonial period. It highlights their social networks (Kŭnhuhoe), professional activities (writing, teaching), health concerns (food poisoning, illness requiring travel for treatment), and mobility (travel between Seoul, Kando, and coastal areas). The mention of Kando and its large Korean population (400,000 compatriots) underscores its significance as a major center of Korean life outside the peninsula during this era. The term "佳人" (beauty) used for these accomplished women reflects contemporary perceptions.
