Article Type: 시 (Poem)

Late at night, the Milky Way (河漢) is seen tilting west.
Remembering Chang’an (長安) is like a dream.
People in the world all grow old longing for each other.
The daytime cicada cries urge on the summer heat.

Sitting alone, I softly hum “Cutting Trees, Ding Ding (伐木丁).”
Living poorly in a rocky cave (岩穴), I am ashamed of my true feelings (眞情).
Many worldly affairs (天下事) must come to pass soon.
My lingering thoughts descend endlessly. <70>

**Summary**

This short poem, written in Hanja (Classical Chinese), expresses themes of solitude, nostalgia, and contemplation. The speaker observes the night sky, reminisces about Chang'an (likely a metaphor for a lost past or perhaps Seoul), reflects on the universal experience of aging and longing, and sits alone feeling insignificant while considering the weight of worldly matters. For historians, the piece is interesting as an example of continued Hansi composition by Koreans during the colonial period, showcasing the persistence of traditional literary forms. The themes of longing, isolation, and contemplation of "worldly affairs" might also subtly reflect the sentiments and anxieties prevalent under Japanese rule.
