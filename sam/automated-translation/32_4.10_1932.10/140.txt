Brief Character Sketch: Wŏn Chongnin
						By Hwang Sŏgu

It cannot be denied that the existence of Mr. Wŏn Chongnin feels as though it has entirely disappeared now.
However, Mr. Wŏn Chongnin is a figure whose name cannot be silenced (黙殺) in the history of the social movement of Korean students in Tokyo.

Mr. Wŏn was the foremost pioneer (先驅者) of anarchism (아나) in Tokyo.
His name was such that among the Japanese, he could be considered a figure like Sakamoto Shūsui (板本秋江)—a peer of Mr. Takatsu Masamichi (高津正道君) who was under the banner of Ōsugi Sakae (大杉榮)—the person who formed the Hŭktohoe (黑禱會) with me, the first Korean officer (幹事) of the Cosmo Club (코스모俱樂部), or China’s Zhang Ji (張繼).

I, too, was drawn out onto the path of the movement (운동線) by Mr. Wŏn’s hand. Mr. Wŏn was truly the first figure to emerge from Korean anarchism (朝鮮아나).

Currently, Mr. Wŏn is living obscurely in Tokyo. In what direction he will re-enter the movement path in the future is a rather intriguing puzzle worth anticipating.

Mr. Wŏn is a graduate of a law college (法專); his family is that of a millionaire (10萬長者); his father is still disappointed and resentful (憤慨) about his ideological deviation (思想的 脫線).

His personality is somewhat sentimental (感傷的); his detachment (淡泊), his nimbleness (輕快), all his sharp (明銳) aspects almost make one feel he should have gone into literature.<44>

Mr. Wŏn was also a person with a clear (明晳) theoretical mind. However, his will for action (실행意志), his will to struggle (투쟁意志), had become somewhat weak. Perhaps it was because his critique of things was too clear—

In any case, he was someone who soon cried out in disillusionment (幻滅) within the movement. His ideology immediately after his withdrawal (隱退) leaned towards nihilism (니히리스).

Mr. Wŏn’s withdrawal from the world of ideology (思想界 隱退) shared the same fate as mine. When he tasted that disappointment, his thoughts ran towards emptiness (虛無).

In other words, Mr. Wŏn can be called one of those in the Korean intellectual world who suffered lamentable misfortune and lack of recognition (感呵不遇).

That Mr. Wŏn has not sullied his integrity (節介) as an ideologue to this day, patiently enduring in silence (忍苦黙黙), hiding his existence abroad (國外), and quietly awaiting the chance to soar again like a hero in the future (後日 再雄飛의 機), is something limitlessly respectable and anticipated. <45>

**Summary**

This article by Hwang Sŏgu is a reminiscence about Wŏn Chongnin, an early and influential figure in the Korean anarchist movement among students in Tokyo during the colonial period. Hwang describes Wŏn as a pioneer who drew him into activism, comparing Wŏn's stature to Japanese anarchists like Sakamoto Shūsui and Takatsu Masamichi and the Chinese figure Zhang Ji. Despite his clear intellect and wealthy background, Wŏn, a law graduate, apparently became disillusioned with the movement due to his sharp critical perspective and weak will to struggle, eventually withdrawing into obscurity and near-nihilism in Tokyo. Hwang expresses deep respect for Wŏn's continued ideological integrity while living quietly and hopes for his eventual return to prominence.

From a historical perspective, the article is valuable for its firsthand account of the early Korean anarchist circle in Tokyo, naming key individuals (Wŏn Chongnin, Hwang Sŏgu) and associated groups (Hŭktohoe, Cosmo Club). It sheds light on the connections between Korean and Japanese anarchist movements (mentioning Ōsugi Sakae's circle) and reveals the internal struggles and psychological toll (disillusionment, withdrawal) experienced by activists under colonial rule. The mention of Wŏn's wealthy background and his father's disapproval also hints at the class dynamics and familial conflicts surrounding radical political involvement.

人物短評 元鍾麟
						黃錫禹
元鍾麟君의 존재는 지금에 와서는 전혀 살어저 버린 感이 업지안타.
그러나 元鍾麟君은 東京유학생의 사회운동史上에 잇서서는 그 일홈을 黙殺식힐 수 업는 인물이다.
元君은 東京에 잇서서는 아나로는 第1人의 先驅者이엿다.
그 일홈은 日本人間에 잇서서는 板本秋江 그는 大杉榮旗下에 在하던 高津正道君과의 同輩  나와 가티 黑禱會를 맨든 사람 코스모俱樂部의 朝鮮人 최초의 幹事 中國의 張繼가튼 인물이엿다 할 수 잇다.
나 역시 元君의 손에 운동線으로 끄을려 나갓섯다. 元君은 實로 朝鮮아나의 첫등장인물이엇다.
지금 元君은 東京에 숨어잇는 중 今後의 君의 어떠한 방향으로 다시 운동線에 진출할는지는 퍽 기대할 만한 흥미잇는 수수꺽기라 할 수 잇다.
元君은 法專출신 그 집은 10萬長者 그 아버지는 지금것 君의 思想的 脫線에 실망 憤慨하여잇다.
君의 성격은 稍히 感傷的 그 淡泊 그 輕快 明銳한 모든 점은 차라리 문학으로＜44＞ 나갓드면 하는 늣김을 갓게도 한다.
君은 그 이론적 頭腦도 明晳한 사람이엿다. 그러나 그 실행意志 투쟁意志가 좀 弱하여젓다. 넘우 사물에 대한 비판이 맑은 때문이엿는지는 몰으나―
좌우간 운동에 잇서서 곳 幻滅을 불으짓는 사람이엿섯다. 그의 隱退直後의 思想은 니히리스로 들어 갓섯다.
元君의 思想界 隱退는 나와 그 운명을 가티 하엿다. 그는 그 실망을 맛볼 때 그 思想이 虛無로 달려갓다.
말하면 君은 朝鮮의 思想界에 잇서서의 感呵不遇의 한사람이라 할 수 잇다.
君이 지금까지 思想人으로의 그 節介를 더럽히지안코 忍苦黙黙 國外에 그 존재를 숨겨 고요히 後日 再雄飛의 機를 기둘느고 잇는 것이 限업시 존경스럽고 기대되는 일이라 하겟다.＜45＞
