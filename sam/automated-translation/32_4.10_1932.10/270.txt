**Body Text Translation:**
Farewell Poem
						From Kimch'ŏn, Chijae

Human feelings are the same when it's time to regretfully part,
Green trees, setting sun, a thousand-li road.

Regretting parting is nothing other than the difficulty of meeting again,
The rustling departing horse intentionally lingers. <69>

**Summary**

This short poem, written in classical Chinese (Hanja), expresses the universal sentiment of sorrow associated with parting (惜別). The poet notes the shared human feeling of regret at separation, evokes imagery of a long journey under a setting sun, highlights the pain stemming from the uncertainty of reunion (難再期), and concludes with the image of a horse seemingly reluctant to depart, mirroring the traveler's feelings. From a historical perspective, the article showcases the continued practice of composing Hanja poetry by Korean intellectuals during the Japanese colonial period, reflecting the persistence of traditional literary forms and themes even amidst modernization and external pressures. It signifies the use of established East Asian literary conventions to express personal emotions.
