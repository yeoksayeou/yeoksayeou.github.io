**Mountain Field Six Songs**

First Song
Leaning on the mountain, several terraced fields; the farmhouse’s joys and sorrows repeat year after year.
In leisure, every single thing finds peace in its nature; garden grass and courtyard birds each find their mates.

Second Song
A screen of green bamboo encircles the peaks; the clouds on the peaks haven't changed their ancient form.
Amidst them, many flowering trees bloom among the rocks; heaven crafted wondrous shapes, mountains wind round and round.

Third Song
Gazing afar at the great flat fields, where rice and millet are planted, the year's work is done.
Tilling fields and digging wells are timeless pursuits; drumming the belly, one truly knows the people of Yao and Shun's era. <70>

Fourth Song
Deep and green are the trees; on thousand-year pines perch cranes crying from the high marsh.
The brushwood gate is quiet, quiet, listening for the rooster's crow; the herb garden and sunflower patch lie in spring's shade.

Fifth Song
The peak path winds and turns, becoming secluded; mountain homes with fences stand beside the clouds' edge.
Calling a boy to fetch wine, I invite poet friends; the moon rises over the courtyard paulownia, a late-night pavilion.

Sixth Song
East and west, the valley settlements stretch long with mulberry and hemp; whose house is that amidst the misty willows?
Young children sit in order by the bedside, reading the books of sages and worthies, learning the ways of filial and fraternal duty. <71>

**Summary**

This six-stanza poem, written in classical Chinese style (Hansi), depicts an idealized vision of rural life in a Korean mountain setting ("Sanjŏn"). It paints scenes of farming, natural beauty, peaceful coexistence with nature, quiet contemplation, social gatherings, and the upholding of traditional Confucian values like filial piety through education. The poem emphasizes harmony, contentment, and timelessness, evoking the peaceful reigns of legendary Chinese emperors Yao and Shun. From a historical perspective, the poem is interesting as it presents a serene, almost utopian portrayal of rural Korea in 1932, amidst the hardships of Japanese colonial rule. Historians might analyze this idyllic representation as a form of escapism, a quiet affirmation of traditional Korean values against imposed modernity, or simply a non-political aesthetic exercise common in the period.
