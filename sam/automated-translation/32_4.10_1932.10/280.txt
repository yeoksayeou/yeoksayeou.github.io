Article Type: 시 (Poem)

Late, sitting on a high pavilion, I sing a song;

The song breaks off, layered clouds arise.

Fleeting life in this world, time passes swiftly;

Like flowing water, human life has many transient stays.

In the courtyard with the ailing paulownia (病梧), autumn arrives first;

By the steps near the tall bamboo (修竹), the path turns slanted.

When meeting by chance, be careful not to part lightly, for separation is hard;

Ten years of longing (相思), how much regret is there? <70>

**Summary**

This classical Chinese poem (Hansi) expresses themes of melancholy and transience. Sitting alone on a pavilion late in the day, the poet reflects on the swift passage of time and the temporary nature of human existence, likened to staying at inns. The arrival of autumn signals decay and a turn towards hardship. The final couplet laments a ten-year separation, emphasizing the pain of parting and the depth of regret from prolonged longing. From a historical perspective, while deeply personal, the poem's themes of separation, longing, and the passage of time under potentially sorrowful circumstances might resonate with the broader Korean experience during the colonial period. The use of traditional poetic forms to express personal sentiment during this era is also of interest.
