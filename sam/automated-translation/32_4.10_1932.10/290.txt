Remembering Old Friends in the Capital City on a Summer Night

Returning, I lie in my humble hut, pillowed by the old mountains,
Beside the tall buildings [in the capital], the old tree of longing stands.
Electric lights [shine]; at midnight, the palace gate is quiet,
Nights in the capital (長安), filled with string music, songs, and cups of wine.

Day after day, morning and night, seeing your esteemed faces,
The meaningful sound of the zither amidst flowing water.
The train covers a thousand li; the mountain pass clouds are stubborn,
Seeing the moon, surely you too feel the same longing. <70>

**Summary**

This classical Chinese poem expresses the poet's nostalgia for friends left behind in the capital city (Kyŏngsŏng/Seoul) while living in a remote, mountainous area. On a summer night, the poet contrasts their quiet, humble dwelling with memories of vibrant city life – electric lights, palace gates, music, wine, and the company of esteemed friends (貴顔). The poem highlights the great distance separating them, symbolized by the train journey and obstructing mountain clouds, concluding with the shared human experience of longing under the same moon. For historians, the poem offers a glimpse into personal sentiments during the colonial period, reflecting a connection to the modernized capital (mention of electric lights, train) despite physical distance, and the continued use of classical Chinese poetic forms for expressing personal emotion among intellectuals.
