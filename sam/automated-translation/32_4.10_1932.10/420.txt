Nonsense
						Sin Puch'ul

If I try to write my Sijo after seeing many of others' Sijo,
Without my knowing, half of it is in others' style.
You, don't find fault, just read it anyway.

It goes without saying I have no money, homeless is my wandering state,
Spending this restless time ceaselessly, without end,
A whole life so absurd, there's no time to set my mind at ease.

Though the mind visits heaven, why can the body not go?
Realizing once more that I am fundamentally human,
I straighten my collar and think once more.

They say they wish to live long, even if living dirtily,
Though one lives but a moment, why can't one live like a human?
Everyone says it's their own way, when will this path be resolved?

If you say a bird cries, is there ever a time it does not cry?
Why would a flower only smile? Surely there are times it weeps.
Humans tell lies only when they think they are right.

Stagnation, procrastination, postponement – can they be cured even with medicine?
Pretending to have when one has not, pretending to know when one does not –
These pretenses aren't even fit for offerings (체), they are pretenses that kill people.

Eating and clothing are difficult, finding a place to be is also difficult,
Living is hard enough, yet dying too is difficult.
Among the difficult and difficult things, understanding the world is difficult.<95>

**Summary**

This poem, composed of several Sijo stanzas, expresses deep disillusionment and critiques societal hypocrisy. The author reflects on the lack of originality, the hardship of poverty and aimlessness, the gap between aspiration and reality, and the preference for longevity over a dignified life. It criticizes various forms of pretense – particularly feigning wealth or knowledge – as destructive lies, contrasting human dishonesty with the perceived authenticity of nature. The poem concludes by emphasizing the overwhelming difficulty of basic survival and understanding the complex world. For historians, the poem offers insight into the pervasive sense of hardship, existential angst, and social critique prevalent among some intellectuals during the Japanese colonial period in Korea. The pseudonym "Sin Puch'ul" (Shin Does Not Emerge/Appear) itself might signify a withdrawal or disillusionment reflective of the era's constraints.

남의 時調 만히 보고 내 時調 쓰량이면
나도 모르는새 남의 투가 절반이라
그대는 탓하지말고 거저 읽어두게나

돈이야 업다마다 집도 업서 도는 꼴이
쉴새업는 이 시절을 하욤업시 보내나니
한평생 어이업서서 맘놀때가 업다네

맘은 하날 갓다와도 몸은 어이 못가는가
근본 사람임을 다시한번 더 알고서
옷깃을 바로 염이고 생각한번 더 하네

더럽게 살지라도 오래살기 바란다니
한시를 살지언정 사람답게 왜 못사나
저마다 제대로라니 이길 언제 풀니노

새가 운다 하량이면 우는 때라 업슬소냐
꼿이 어이 우슬뿐고 우는 때도 잇술 것을
사람은 저만 오른제 거즛말을 하더라

적체구체 미루체는 약으로나 곳친달가
업고도 잇는체와 모르고도 아는체는
체에도 못밧칠체니 사람 죽일 체라네

먹고 입기 어려운데 잇슬곳도 어려우니
살기도 어렵거늘 죽기조차 어려워라
어렵고 어려운 중에 세상알기 어려워＜95＞
