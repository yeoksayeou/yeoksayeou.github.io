**Body Text Translation:**
Oh, Brother Sŏhae!! It was from the August issue of Samch'ŏlli that I first learned you had departed this world. Why? When I wrote to you, you sent a postcard saying, "My body is a bit sick, but it doesn't seem like I'll die," but that turned out to be your lie. If it weren't for Samch'ŏlli, I still wouldn't have known. When I was leaving for Tokyo, that was the last time we had a good time together. I always discussed everything with you, Brother.

The night before I left, didn't I call you, Brother, and we drank farewell liquor at OO舘 until past eleven at night? If that had been the final drink, never to meet again, I would have wished we could have stayed up all night having fun! It was last lunar New Year. I don't remember which day, but you called me on the telephone and said, "Hey, it's me, let's get together tonight. Come to the house in Ch'ebu-dong." So I went to your house in the evening, and Mr. Hyŏn Ch'ŏl and Brother Ch'oe Sŭng-man were there.

I knew Mr. Hyŏn Ch'ŏl well, and didn't you introduce Mr. Ch'oe Sŭng-man as a painter? Then you pestered me to sing a song, so didn't I say I was going to the outhouse (便所) and hide under the tree in the backyard? At that time, you came out and said, "Hey Ch'ae, let's forget the song then and just have dinner." To think that gentle and affectionate voice is now buried in the ground, what kind of news is this? Last fall, when I was relaxing at Yŏngdo-sa, what do you mean you went there without any notice?

Brother, you suffered greatly after being born into this world. That suffering was indeed a suffering that will shine for posterity. Your novels will remain for generations, but it cannot be the same as you being alive and writing more.

Brother Sŏhae! Ever since I heard the news that you died, it all seems like a false rumor (風說). Right now, my heart aches as if it's being terribly torn, and I am sorrowful. When I was leaving Tokyo, you said, "Bring back lots of souvenirs (미아게). I have no other requests." That voice cannot be bought back now even with thousands or tens of thousands of gold pieces; I suppose this is the play on the stage where humans live.

Brother, you were literature, a novelist, and I was a music student (音樂學徒). Perhaps because our hometowns were in the same province (道內), we were very close friends (親友).

Forgetting even that friendship, you have gone forever. Why did you go without living a bit more strongly? You left already? If only you were older like others, it might be less painful. Oh, that young, young body of youth! The more I think about it, the more resentful I feel. Didn't you realize that losing you is a great loss to the Peninsula's novel scene? If only your grave were here, I would tear at my heart and cry my voice hoarse. But even your grave is far away.

Today, Sunday, even in the evening sun (夕陽), while walking on the green grass of Hibiya Park, I thought of you, Brother, and held back hot tears.

Did you really pass away? Ah, my heart hurts too much, I cannot write anymore. Oh, Brother Sŏhae!! Oh! Brother Sŏhae

**Summary**

The author, Ch'ae Kyu-yŏp, writing from Tokyo, expresses profound shock and grief upon learning about the death of his close friend, the novelist "Sŏhae" (Ch'oe Sŏhae), from the Samch'ŏlli magazine. He reminisces about their last meeting before Ch'ae left for Tokyo, sharing drinks and conversations, unaware it would be their final encounter. He recalls Sŏhae's gentle voice, their friendship rooted partly in sharing the same home province, and laments Sŏhae's difficult life and premature death at a young age, calling it a major loss for Korean literature. Ch'ae feels immense sorrow, wishing he could visit Sŏhae's grave, but it is far away.

From a historical perspective, the article highlights the personal connections and shared artistic milieu among Korean intellectuals and artists during the colonial period, spanning literature and music. It underscores the mobility between Korea (Seoul - Ch'ebu-dong, Yŏngdo-sa) and Japan (Tokyo - Hibiya Park), a common pattern for intellectuals of the time. The mention of Ch'oe Sŏhae, a prominent proletarian writer known for depicting the hardships of the marginalized, adds significance, and the author's lament over his friend's suffering and early death reflects the often precarious existence of artists and writers under colonial rule. The text, with its 1930s orthography, also serves as a linguistic snapshot of the era.

曙海兄이여
						東京 蔡奎燁
曙海兄이여!! 兄이 이 세상을 떠낫다고 듯기는 8월호 삼천리에서 처음 알엇소이다. 웨요저. 내가 편지하엿슬 때엔 「몸이 좀 아프나 그다지 죽을 것 갓지는 안소」하고 엽서에 써보내엿던 것은 兄의 거즛이 되엿구만요. 나는 三千里가 아니엿드면 아직도 몰낫슬 것이외다. 내가 東京으로 떠나올 때 마지막으로 兄하고 그럼 잘 놀앗구먼요 나는 언제나 무엇이던지 兄하고 의논하고 하여 왓슴니다.
내가 떠나오던 前日밤 나는 兄을 불러 OO舘에서 밤 열 한시가 넘도록 이별酒를 마시지 안엇서요. 그것이 최후의 참말 다시 만나지못할 술이엿드면 밤이 새이도록 실컨 놀앗슬 것을! 지난 음正月이엿슴니다. 어느 날인지 내게 電話를 걸어서 「여보 난데 오놀 밤저녁이나 가티합시다. 體府洞집으로 오시오」 하기에 나는 저녁때 兄의 집으로 가니까 玄哲씨와 崔承萬兄이 와 잇섯습듸다.
玄哲씨는 내가 잘 알고 崔承萬씨는 화가라고 소개하여 주지 안엇소. 그다음 나더러 노래하나 하라고 졸느기에 나는 便所로 간다고 하고 뒤뜻나무미테 숨엇지 안엇소. 그때 兄이 나와 「여보蔡 그럼 노래는 집어치우고 저녁이나 합시다」하던 그 부드럽고 다정스럽든 목소래도 지금은 땅속에 뭇치웟다니 이게 무슨 소문이오. 작년가을엔 永導寺에서 놀던 나에게 아모 通知업시 갓다는 말이 웬말이오.
兄은 이 세상에 태여나 몹시 고생하엿소이다. 그 고생이야말로 後世까지 빗나는 고생이엿슴니다. 兄의 소설이 代代로 남을 것이나 兄이 살어서 작고 쓰기만은 갓지 못할 것이외다.
曙海兄! 兄이 죽엇다는 소문을 들은 나는 지금껏 모다 거짓風說 갓소이다. 지금 내가슴은 몹시 찌저지는 듯 쓰리고 애닯슴니다. 東京서 나올 때 「미아게」나 만히 가지고 오시오. 다른 부탁은 업소 하던 그 말소리 지금 千金萬金으로 살려도 못살 형편이니 이것이 사람사는 舞臺의 연극인가 봄니다.
兄은 문학 즉 소설가이엿고 나는 음악學徒이엿슴니다. 고향도 한 道內이엿슴인지 몹시 다정한 親友이엿슴니다.
그런 우정도 이저버리고 영원히 가섯구만요. 웨 좀더 힘차게 살지아니하고 가섯슴니까 벌서 가단이요. 남과 가티 나히라도 만헛드면 덜이나 할걸. 그 젊고 절문 청춘의 몸아! 생각하면 생각할사록 원통함니다. 兄을 이른 것이 半島소설계의 큰손실임을 깨닷지 못하엿습듸까. 이곳에 兄의 무덤이라도 잇섯스면 실컨 가삼을 찟고 목노아 울어 보겟슴니다. 무덤조차 멀-니 하여 잇구만요.
나는 오늘 일요일 夕陽에도 日比谷公園 푸른잔듸를 걸으며 兄의 생각을 하고 뜨거운 눈물을 먹음엇소이다.
정말 兄이 돌아가섯는지? 아 내 마음은 몹시 아퍼서 더 쓰지못하겟소이다. 曙海兄이여!! 오! 曙海兄
