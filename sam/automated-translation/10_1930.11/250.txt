洛陽城裏見秋風
復恐忽忽說不盡

欲作家書意萬里
行人--發又開封 ＜70＞

***

In Luoyang city, I see the autumn wind,
Again I fear that in my haste I cannot say all.

I want to write a letter home, thoughts spanning ten thousand li,
The traveler -- departs, yet opens [it] again. <70>

**Summary**

This short article presents a classical Chinese poem titled "Autumn Thoughts," attributed to an anonymous author (失名). The poem expresses deep nostalgia and homesickness experienced during autumn in the foreign city of Luoyang. The poet wishes to write home but feels overwhelmed by emotion and the vast distance, hesitating even as the letter is about to be sent. For historians, the inclusion of a classical Chinese poem (a slightly modified version of Zhang Ji's famous work) in a Korean magazine from 1930 highlights the continued significance of Chinese literary tradition among Korean intellectuals during the colonial period. The theme of longing and separation might also resonate with the contemporary Korean situation under Japanese rule. The anonymity could be literal or a choice reflecting the poem's mood.
