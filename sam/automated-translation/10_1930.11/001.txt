Youth is Brief, So Let's Laugh and Get Through It

▼Switching Trains
In a third-class train car, a Salvation Army member, with a rather impolite tone, asked a passenger sitting nearby,
"Are you thinking of going to Heaven?"
The person naturally replied,
"What about you?"
Salvation Army member: "Me? Of course, I'm going."
The person: "In that case, switch trains at the next station. This train doesn't go there."

▼Order
Sergeant (during the height of the Great War): "Captain! We're completely out of ammunition!"
Captain: "What? Completely out?"
Sergeant: "Yes, not a single round left!"
Captain: "Then cease firing from now on!"

▼Legacy
"They say when the widow next door died, she donated her legacy to the orphanage."
"That's admirable. So, was there such a legacy?"
"Eleven children (兒孩)."

▼The Coachman's Little One
A certain gentleman hired a new carriage coachman. A few days later, he went to the carriage house and saw two or three of the coachman's little children playing.
Gentleman: "Hey you, do you know who I am?"
Little one: "Sure I know. You're the one who gets rides in our father's carriage."

▼Double-Barreled
Customer (angrily): "Hey! You said this gun could shoot up to 100 yards, but when I actually tested it, it didn't go further than 50 yards!"
Shopkeeper: "Ah, that's not it. Since that gun is double-barreled (二連發), you have to combine them."

▼Marriage
Mother playfully asked her young daughter, "Do you wish to marry?"
Daughter: "When I marry, Mother, do not come."
Mother: "Why do you say I should not come?"
Daughter: "When Mother married, why did you not invite me?"

▼The Knack
Merchant: "Do you have experience handling pottery (砂器)?"
Shop Boy: "Yes, sir. I've handled it for many years."
Merchant: "What do you do if you break an expensive piece?"
Shop Boy: "I stick it back together seamlessly and show it to the next customer..." [Original text corrupted/illegible here]
Merchant: "That's right. That's the way. You're a boy who knows the knack of the pottery trade, so you'll work for me."

▼Eyeglasses
Person A, new to the capital (初人京), saw electric trams and bicycles (自行車) running and returned saying, "Kyŏngsŏng (京城) is truly another world (眞別世界)!"
Person B: "Why do you call it another world?"
Person A: "People in the capital (京人) can ride houses to travel, and they also ride eyeglasses to run."

**Summary**

This article is a compilation of short jokes and humorous anecdotes published in the Korean magazine *Samch'ŏlli* in 1930. The jokes cover various themes including misunderstandings in conversation (Salvation Army member, child's perspective), military life (running out of ammunition), wordplay (double-barreled gun), family interactions (marriage question, widow's 'legacy'), commerce (broken pottery), and naive observations about modern technology by someone new to the city (trams as 'houses', bicycles as 'eyeglasses'). The humor often stems from simple misunderstandings, literal interpretations, or dry wit. For historians, the piece offers a glimpse into popular humor during the colonial period, reflecting interactions with Western elements (Salvation Army), modernization (trains, trams, bicycles in Kyŏngsŏng), social archetypes (widow, merchant, naive newcomer), and perhaps subtle commentary on authority (military order). The mix of everyday Korean with Hanmun-style phrasing in some jokes is also characteristic of the era.
