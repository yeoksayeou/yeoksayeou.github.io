Turtle Ship

Ch'ungmugong's (忠武公) Turtle Ship, which was used during the Imjin War (壬辰亂), was truly the progenitor of the modern submarine (潛航艇). The ironclad ship said to have been invented first in the West (西洋) was the one used by the Confederate Army (南軍) during the American (米國) Civil War (南北戰爭) in the Western calendar year (西歷) 1862; Ch'ungmugong's creation of the ship (創艦) truly preceded this by 270 years.＜14＞

**Summary**

This short article highlights Admiral Yi Sunsin's (Ch'ungmugong) Turtle Ship from the Imjin War (1592-1598) as a pioneering naval invention. It asserts that the Turtle Ship predates the Western ironclad, specifically citing the Confederate ironclad used in the American Civil War (1862), by 270 years, positioning it as an early precursor, even hyperbolically suggesting it as the "progenitor of the modern submarine." From a colonial history perspective, the article is interesting as it emphasizes Korean technological prowess and historical achievement centuries before Western advancements, serving as a point of national pride and subtle resistance against colonial narratives that might diminish Korean history during a period of Japanese rule. Historians might note the specific comparison point (the American Civil War ironclad) and the slightly inaccurate claim linking the surface vessel Turtle Ship to submarines, likely for rhetorical effect to emphasize its advanced, covered nature.
