Chat Room

**Misunderstanding**

Thief: "Somehow, please spare my life. Many people depend on me to live."
Judge: "Do you mean the young children in your house?"
Thief: "No, the detectives (探偵)!"

**Bait**

Passerby: "What are you doing with an apple (林檎) tied to the end of the line?"
Fisherman: "I'm fishing for fish."
Passerby: "What's the apple (林檎) for?"
Fisherman: "It's bait."
Passerby: "An apple (林檎) for bait? That won't work. Unless it's a worm (벌네)..."
Fisherman: "That fellow (냥반) is quite nosy (창견하네). There's a worm (벌네) inside this apple (林檎). Because it's a worm-eaten apple (林檎)."

**Jealousy**

Judge: "When your husband secretly entered the girls' school dormitory, did you follow him in too?"
Criminal's Wife: "Yes, of course, Judge. Just think about it. If a man enters a room where young women (색시) are sleeping naked, wouldn't even your wife (안해) go in too?!"<41>

**Summary**

This article presents three short humorous anecdotes or jokes. The first involves a thief pleading for his life by claiming detectives rely on his criminal activities for their livelihood. The second features a witty exchange where a fisherman justifies using an apple as bait because it contains a worm. The third depicts a wife explaining her trespassing into a girls' dormitory, where her husband had snuck in, as a natural act of jealousy that even the judge's wife would commit. From a historical perspective, these jokes offer glimpses into social dynamics and humor in 1930s Korea, touching upon law enforcement perceptions, everyday interactions, and gender relations/views on jealousy. The language itself, with its older orthography and expressions, is also of interest to linguistic historians.
