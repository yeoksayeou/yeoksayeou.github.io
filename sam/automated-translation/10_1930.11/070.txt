The True Story of the Hague Secret Emissary Affair, The International Peace Conference and the Storm Clouds in the Far East
						Narrated by a certain elderly statesman from the late Korean Empire...

The Taegeukgi Suddenly Hoisted in the Capital of Holland Where Envoys of Nations Gathered

In June 1907 (Meiji 40 = Gwangmu 11), when the storm clouds over the Far East were rapidly gathering, the International Peace Conference, proposed by Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, was held in The Hague, the international city of Holland. To attend it, envoys from dozens of countries across the globe gathered. Not only from nearby European nations like Great Britain, Germany, France, and Belgium, but also from the distant Far East came Japan, and from the Americas came the United States. Each brought numerous international law scholars, authoritative politicians, and newspaper reporters, bustling about to handle the world's affairs. At this time, in front of a certain hotel in the center of The Hague, a large Taegeukgi (太極旗), like a door panel, was hoisted and fluttered well in the passing breeze. This was a common sight during international conferences, as it was customary for envoys from each country to raise their national flag in front of their accommodation, and the Korean envoys formally did so as well.

The curtain rose on the great storm clouds of the late Korean Empire—which would later see the abdication of Emperor Kojong, the disbandment of the army, the conclusion of the Jeongmi Seven Treaties (丁未 7條約), and other rapid changes like the establishment of the Residency-General (統監府)—from this single Taegeukgi fluttering in the center of The Hague.

So, what was the nature of this Peace Conference in The Hague, and what role did Korea's secret envoys strive to play in this conference?

Today, there are the League of Nations, the London Conference, the Washington Conference, etc., which formulate international public law and smooth over political friction. However, over 20 years ago, such permanent organs did not yet exist. This conference was convened solely by the Russian Tsar to resolve the political situation in the Balkan Peninsula, establish rules for land and naval warfare, and settle political disputes among nations through peaceful means. It was an extremely authoritative and important gathering. Naturally, the world's attention was focused on this small capital, The Hague. The expectations and movements of small and weak nations were also particularly significant. At the very beginning of the conference, representatives of the Georgian people, who were annexed by Russia, had already entered the city and were actively campaigning for their independence movement.

The Activities of the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun and the Shock to Japanese Political Circles, Both Domestic and International

In this atmosphere, on June 29th, three envoys suddenly appeared in The Hague, planted the Taegeukgi in front of their hotel, claimed to have been personally dispatched by the Korean Emperor, and vigorously attempted to engage in activities. Who were these figures? As the world knows, they were Yi Sangsŏl (李相卨), Yi Chun (李儁), and Yi Wiyŏng (李偉鍾). Yi Sangsŏl was a man of righteous indignation. Seeing the state of affairs deteriorating, he was a passionate man who had once even attempted to commit suicide in protest by striking his head against the bell tower of P'yŏngyang Castle. He had served as Uiŭijŏngbu Ch'amch'an (議政府 參贊), equivalent to the current Chief Cabinet Secretary, but was dismissed during the Protectorate Treaty of Gwangmu year 9 (1905). Yi Chun, after graduating from Waseda Senmon Gakkō (早稻田專門學校) in Japan, served as a prosecutor at the P'yŏngniwŏn (平理院). He was a man of strong principles who even sued the then Minister of Justice, asserting that the special amnesty granted during Emperor Sunjong's wedding was unfair. Yi Wiyŏng was a secretary at the legation in Russia, fluent in English, French, and Russian, a young diplomat with a refined appearance. At that time, communicating with Hulbert (헐버트) and carrying Emperor Kojong's credentials (信任狀) and 200,000 wŏn in personal funds (親用金), Yi Sangsŏl and Yi Chun traveled through Hamgyŏng Province to Vladivostok (海參威), and from there took the Trans-Siberian Railway (西伯利亞鐵道) to The Hague. However, as recorded in modern history, Korea's diplomatic rights had already passed to Japan due to the Five Treaties of Gwangmu year 9 (1905). Therefore, since Japanese commissioners were present, it was ostensibly impossible for the Korean Emperor's envoys to attend concurrently. Looking briefly at the activities of the aforementioned secret envoys: the three first visited Count Nelidov (래리또푸 伯), the President of the Peace Conference (a Russian commissioner), requesting participation in the main conference, but he refused due to certain external relations. They then made similar efforts with the Dutch Foreign Minister, the initial chair of the conference, but the <21> result was unsatisfactory. The true objective of the three secret envoys, should they attend the main conference, was to declare that the Protectorate Treaty concluded in Gwangmu year 10 (1906) was contrary to the Korean Emperor's will and should be annulled, and also to appeal to the nations about the course of events between the two countries. However, as attendance at the main conference became unlikely, the secret envoys resorted to visiting envoys from each country individually. Notably, they even submitted a certain resolution to the International Association of Journalists, composed of newspaper reporters from various countries, and managed to get it passed. It was a fact that the attention of both domestic and international audiences was intensely focused (瀑注) on these three envoys. The shocking news of the secret envoys' appearance in The Hague was disseminated worldwide by Reuters (로이델사), and in Japan, it was published in the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun (大阪每日新聞). In the morning edition of July 8th, a telegram from the special correspondent Takaisai (高石), dispatched to The Hague by the Mainichi Shimbun, was featured prominently with large headlines. One excerpt from the original text is presented here:

Telegram from The Hague
As reported yesterday, the leaders of the Korean group, who issued an open letter and are campaigning among the commissioners of various countries, are former Uiŭijŏngbu Ch'amch'an Yi Sangsŏl, former P'yŏngniwŏn Judge Yi Chun, and former Secretary of the Korean Legation in Russia Yi Wiyŏng. Yi Chun studied at Waseda Senmon Gakkō 13 years ago. Yi Sangsŏl was Ch'amch'an two years ago. He arrived in the Russian capital via the Trans-Siberian Railway on April 20th, met Secretary Yi there, and came to The Hague. Before departing, Yi Sangsŏl had an audience with the Korean Emperor and received the seal of a special envoy.
Furthermore, according to Yi Chun, regarding their mission, if Japan questions the Korean Emperor, the Emperor will answer that he knows nothing of it. From this point, it is believed they are indeed acting under the Korean Emperor's secret orders.
Yi Wiyŏng is fluent in Russian, English, and French. He visited the Russian, British, American, and French commissioners, but none welcomed him, so he is currently meeting with the Dutch Foreign Minister to continue his efforts.

As can be seen from this telegram, the shock among the Japanese elite and populace at the appearance of the secret envoys was indeed tremendous.

Resident-General Itō's Secret Telegram Order and Foreign Envoys' Attendance at Yi Chun's Funeral

At that time, the special correspondent for the Osaka Mainichi was a man named Takaisai (高石) (currently an executive at Osaka Mainichi). He received orders from the head office and rushed to The Hague from his post in London. However, this Mainichi reporter, utilizing his position as a journalist, visited the three secret envoys at the aforementioned hotel under the instruction of one of the Japanese envoys, Fleet Admiral Shimamura (島村元師), and listened to their arguments for a long time <22> before returning. The gist was that they came with the Emperor's credentials to petition the Peace Conference and aimed to recover the sovereignty partially lost by Korea due to the Japan-Korea Treaty. The conversation between the two parties at that time went:
"So, did you really bring the Korean Emperor's credentials?"
"We certainly did."
"Then please show them."
"We cannot show them. We received strict orders from the Emperor not to show them to anyone other than the Peace Conference envoys until the mission is completed."
"Then, would you like to meet the Japanese Plenipotentiary?"
"Absolutely not."
In reality, the reporter had intended to ask to see the credentials to quickly photograph the secret document and send it to the Japanese government, but he was refused by the secret envoys in this manner. (Japanese Plenipotentiary Baron Tsuzuki (都筑男爵) also confessed that he had earnestly requested this of Takaisai.) The reason the Japanese Plenipotentiary and others scrambled to obtain a photograph of the secret letter was that the then Resident-General of Korea, Itō (伊藤), was greatly alarmed upon learning of the secret envoys' appearance and had telegraphed the Japanese Plenipotentiary headquarters in The Hague demanding conclusive evidence.
This secret envoy incident became the rapid fuse that led to events such as the abdication in the middle of the night, civil disturbances in various places, attacks on train stations, and the activities of figures like Yi Kap (李甲). However, there will be another day to detail these under a different topic, so they are omitted here.
Furthermore, the panicked Korean government at the time put the three secret envoys on trial and delivered judgments in absentia (闕席判決), sentencing Yi Sangsŏl to death by hanging and Yi Wiyŏng to life imprisonment. Prior to this, Yi Chun had died of illness or committed suicide in The Hague. It is said that plenipotentiaries from three unspecified countries participating in the Peace Conference even attended Yi Chun's funeral.
The days and months flow by, history has turned many times, and as we today look back at this Hague Secret Emissary Affair, one of the most dramatic scenes in East Asian politics, we cannot suppress the myriad emotions that spontaneously fill our hearts. (End) <23>

**Summary**

This 1930 article, presented as a memoir by a former official of the late Korean Empire, recounts the 1907 Hague Secret Emissary Affair. It details the arrival of three Korean envoys (Yi Sangsŏl, Yi Chun, Yi Wiyŏng) at the Second Hague Peace Conference, carrying a secret mission from Emperor Kojong to protest the invalidity of the 1905 Protectorate Treaty and appeal for Korea's sovereignty. Despite their efforts, including hoisting the Korean flag and attempting to meet conference officials and foreign journalists, they were denied official participation due to Japan's control over Korea's foreign affairs. The article highlights the shock caused in Japan, particularly the efforts of the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun correspondent and Japanese officials to obtain proof of the Emperor's involvement, which ultimately contributed to Kojong's forced abdication. The piece concludes by reflecting on the tragic outcome, including Yi Chun's death in The Hague and the subsequent crackdown by the Korean government under Japanese pressure. For historians, the article offers a contemporary Korean perspective (albeit published under Japanese rule in 1930) on the event, emphasizing the envoys' determination, the Emperor's secret backing (and deniability strategy), the international context, the role of the press, and Japan's alarmed reaction, framing it as a pivotal precursor to further colonization steps. The mention of foreign dignitaries attending Yi Chun's funeral is also noteworthy.

海牙密使事件 眞相, 萬國平和會議와 極東의 風雲
						韓末 某老政客...述
列國使臣이 모힌 和蘭 首都에 突然히 太極旗가 飜揚
極東風雲이 바야흐로 急하든 1907年(明治 40年=光武 11年) 6月에 和蘭의 國際都市 海牙에는 露國皇帝 니코라이 第 2世가 提唱한 萬國平和會議가 잇서 그에 參席키 爲하야 갓가운 英吉利, 獨逸, 佛蘭西, 伯耳義 等 歐羅巴 列國은 물론 멀니 極東으로부터도 日本, 美洲로보터도 亞美利加 등 實로 地球上의 數十個 國家의 使節이 모다 제각기 제나라의 國際法 學家와 權威잇는 政治家와 新聞記者들을 다수히 다리고 入城하여 全世界의 料理을 하기에 奔走한 때이엇다. 이때에 海牙市의 中央 엇든 호텔 正門 압헤 대문짝가튼 太極旗가 꼬치어 가고오는 바람결에 잘도 날니고 잇섯스니 이것은 國際會議가 잇슬 때마다 늘 보는 일로 各國使臣은 自國의 宿舍 압헤 國旗을 依例히 高揚하는 慣例인데 朝鮮使臣도 正式으로 그리하엿슴이다.
뒷날 高宗皇帝의 讓位까지 보게 되고 軍隊의 解散과 丁未 7條約의 締結과 其他 統監府設置 等 急速度의 轉變을 보게 된 韓末의 大風雲의 序幕은 이리하야 海牙市의 中央에 날니는 이 太極旗 한 장으로부터 이러낫든 것이다.
그러면 海牙의 이 平和會義란 엇더한 性質의 것이며 또 朝鮮의 密使는 엇든 作用을 이 會議에 이르키고저 活躍하엿든가?
오늘날은 國際聯盟이나 倫敦會議, 華盛頓會議 等이 잇서서 國際公法의 制定과 政治上 軋轢을 撫摩하여 오는 터이지만 20餘年前에는 그러한 常設機關이 아직 업섯고 오직 露國皇帝가 巴爾幹半島의 政局과 또 陸海戰法規와 列國間의 政治的 紛料를 平和手段으로서 解決짓고저 이 會議를 부른 것이니 甚히 權威잇고 重要한 會合이라 世界의 視聽이 이 少都 海牙에 集中된 것은 물론 弱小民族의 期待와 運動도 또한 자별한 바 잇서서 會議劈頭에 벌서 로서아에 倂含 되어 잇든 「조-지아」民族이 獨立運動을 이르키고저 代表가 入城하여 盛히 活躍하고까지 잇섯다.

大阪每日新聞의 活躍과 日本內外政界의 驚愕
이러한 空氣 속에서 6月 29日에 突然히 海牙에 나타나 太極旗를 호텔 正門에 꼿치고 韓國皇帝로부터 친히 派遣되엿다하야 성히 活躍을 試하는 使節 세사람은 果然 엇더한 人物이든가? 그는 세상이 다 아는 바와 가치 李相卨, 李儁, 李偉鍾이엿다. 李相卨은 慷慨의 人이라. 世事가 글너짐을 보고 일즉 平壤城의 鍾樓에 머리를 쪼아서 憤死하려고까지 한 多熱兒로 지금의 內閣書記官長格인 議政府 參贊으로 잇다가 光武 9年의 保護條約 때에 免職이 되엿섯고 또 李儁은 日本의 早稻田專門學校를 마친 뒤 平理院 檢事로 잇섯고 더욱 純宗帝의 結婚 때에 내린 特赦 不公平하엿다고 당시의 法部大臣을 거러서 告訴까지 한 硬骨男兒이엿스며 李偉鍾은 駐露公使舘 書記官으로 잇는 英語와 佛語, 露語가 暢達한 風釆가 潚酒한 靑年外交家엿다. 그때 「헐버트」와 氣脈을 通하고 韓國皇帝의 信任狀과 親用金 20萬圓을 지닌 뒤 李相卨, 李儁은 咸鏡道를 거처서 海參威에 이르러 다시 그곳으로부터 西伯利亞鐵道로 海牙에 갓든 것이다. 그러나 近世史에 記載되여 잇는 드시 벌서 光武 9年의 五條約으로 말미아마 韓國이 外交權은 日本에 가잇든 때이니 日本委員이 出席한 以上에 또 韓帝의 使臣이 二重列席할 수는 表面으로 不可能한 일이엿섯다. 이제 前記 密使의 活動經過를 一瞥하건대 3人은 처음 平和會義 議長으로 잇는 「래리또푸」伯(露國委員)을 訪問하야 本會議參列을 要求하다가 對外的 엇든 關係로 그가 不能하엿고 다시 同會議 初代委員인 和蘭 外務大臣에게 同樣運動을 이르켯스나 그도 또한＜21＞ 결과가 시원치 못하엿다. 그런데 前記 密使 3人이 이 本抜�議에 列席하는 날이면 光武 10年에 締結한 保護條約은 韓帝의 意思에 反하는 것이니 取消하도록 하고 또 兩國間의 그동안 經緯을 列國에 呼訴하려 함에 眞目的이 잇섯다. 그러나 本會議出席이 加意하지 못하게 됨애 密使는 다시 各國 使臣을 個別訪問하엿고 特히 各國 新聞記者로 組織된 國際協會에 某種의 決議案를 提出 可決케까지 하엿든 것이니 內外의 視聽이 이 3人의 使節 우에 瀑注되고 잇섯든 것만은 事實이엿다. 海牙에 密使出現이라는 驚報가 「로이델」사의 電報로 全世界에 알니어지고 日本에는 大阪每日新聞紙上에 揭載되엿스니 그때 7月 8日 아츰版에는 大每新聞에서 海牙에 特派되엿든 高石特派記者로부터 온 電文이 大書特筆로 실니엿다. 卽 그 중 한가지 原文을 揭載하면

海牙來電
昨報, 公開狀을 發表하야 各國 委員間에 運動을 이르키고 잇든 韓人一行의 首班은 前議政府 參贊 李相卨, 前平理院 判事 李儁, 前駐露韓國公使館 書記舘 李偉鍾으로 李儁은 13年前 早稻田專門學校에 在學하엿고 李相卨은 2年前 參贊에 在職 去 4月 20日 西伯利亞鐵道로 露都에 倒着하야 同所에서 書記官 李와 서로 만나서 海牙에 온 것으로 李相卨은 出發 전에 韓帝에게 謁見하여 特使의 印綬를 受하엿다.
又 李儁의 말에 의하면 我等의 使命에 대하여 만일 日本에서 韓帝를 詰問한다면 帝는 그런 줄을 모른다고 答할 것이라 말하엿다. 이 點으로 보건대 彼等은 實際로 韓帝의 密旨를 밧고 잇는 것으로 確信된다.
李偉鍾은 露, 英 兩語 及 佛語에 熟達하고 露, 英, 米, 佛의 各委員을 訪問하엿스나 모다 반기지 안음으로 方今 和蘭 外相을 맛나 運動 中이다.

이 電文을 보아도 알일이지만 密使出現으로 日本上下의 驚愕은 實로 大端한 바가 잇섯다.

伊藤統監의 秘密電命과 李儁의 葬式에 外使參列
그때 大阪每日의 特派員은 高石(現 大阪每日幹部)이란 사람으로 本社의 命을 밧고 當駐地이든 倫敦에서 海牙로 急行하엿다. 그런데 이 大每記者는 新聞記者란 地位를 利用하여 日本使節의 一人 島村元師의 뜻을 밧어 가지고 密使 3人을 前記 호텔에 訪問하여서 長時間 그네의 主張을 듯고＜22＞ 돌아왓다. 그 要旨는 自己들은 皇帝의 信任狀을 가지고 平和會義에 請願 때문에 온 것과 韓國이 日韓協約에 依하야 一部 損失된 自主權을 回復하려 함이라 한 것이다. 그때 두 편 사람의 會話는
「그래 과연 韓帝의 信任狀을 가지고 왓는가?」
「確實히 가지고 왓노라」
「그러면 좀 보여달나」
「보일 수는 업다. 皇帝로부터 使命을 다하기까지는 平和會義使節外에 누구에게나 보여서는 안된다는 嚴命이 잇섯다」
『그러면 日本全權을 맛나 보고 십흔가?」
「절대로 아니 맛나겟다」
實狀은 그 記者는 信任狀을 보여 달나 하여 그 密書를 얼는 寫眞을 박어서 日本政府에 보낼 內約를 가지고 가섯스나 密使에게 이와가치 拒絶當한 것이엇다.(日本 全權 都筑男爵도 그것을 高石에게 懇扥하엿다고 告白하엿다) 日本 全權 等이 密書의 寫眞을 엇고저 奔走한 까닭은 當時의 韓國 統監 伊藤이 密使出現을 보고 크게 놀라 그 確證을 엇고저 海牙의 日本 全權部에 電命한 까닭이다.
이 密使事件이 急激한 導火體가 되여서 夜半에 讓位라는 일까지 잇섯고 各地에 民擾가 잇섯스며 停車場 襲擊과 李甲 等의 活躍이 잇섯스나 그것은 딴 題目으로 技術할 날이 잇겟기 여기는 略하기로 한다.
그러고 그때에 蒼慌하든 韓國政府는 密使 3人을 裁判에 附하야 李相卨을 絞刑에, 李偉鍾을 終身徵役에 處하는 闕席判決까지 내엿다. 先是하야 李儁은 海牙에서 病死, 或 自決하엿다는데 李儁의 葬式에는 平和會義에 參列하엿든 某某 3個國 全權이 列席까지 하엿더라 한다.
日月은 흐르고 흘너 歷史는 몃변 廻轉하야 오늘을 가진 우리네가 東洋政局의 가장 劇的 光景이든 이 海牙密使事件을 回顧할 때에 萬感이 스사로 가슴을 덥는 것을 참을 길이 업다.(끗)＜23＞
