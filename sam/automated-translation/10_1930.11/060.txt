Collection of Domestic and Foreign News (1)

Dr. Kim Kyu-sik is recently teaching history and English at Nankai University (낭쾌大學) in Tianjin (天津), known as the most famous academic institution in China (中國).

Mr. Kim Ki-jŏn, head of the Ch'ŏndogyo Youth Party (天道敎靑年當首), has departed for and is currently surveying Jiaohe (較河) and Dunhua (敦化)—reported sites where the incident (事變) occurred—in order to investigate the safety and well-being (安危) of fellow Koreans residing in Manchuria (在滿同胞).<19>

**Summary**

This news brief reports on the activities of two prominent Koreans in late 1930. Dr. Kim Kyu-sik, a well-known figure, is teaching at the prestigious Nankai University in Tianjin, China. Meanwhile, Kim Ki-jŏn, leader of the Ch'ŏndogyo Youth Party, is traveling to Jiaohe and Dunhua in Manchuria to investigate the condition of Korean residents following an unspecified "incident." From a historical perspective, the article highlights the engagement of Korean elites in international spheres (like academia in China) during the colonial period. More significantly, it points to the growing instability and danger faced by Korean migrants in Manchuria, necessitating investigations by homeland organizations like the Ch'ŏndogyo Youth Party concerning their "safety and well-being" amidst unfolding "incidents"—likely precursors or part of the wider turmoil in the region leading up to the Manchurian Incident of 1931.
