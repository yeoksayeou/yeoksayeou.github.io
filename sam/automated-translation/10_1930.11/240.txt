Article Title: 杜翁 「子美」 江村詩 (Master Du Fu's "Zǐměi" River Village Poem)
Author: 杜翁 (Tu Ong / Du Fu)
Article Type: 시 (Poem)

Clear river winds its way, embracing the village flow,
Long summer days in River Village, tranquil in every way.
Swallows beneath the eaves come and go as they please,
Gulls on the water, close and tame, approach without dismay.

My old wife draws lines on paper, making a Go board's lines,
My young son hammers a needle, crafting a fishing hook to play.
With many ills, my only need is medicine for my days,
This humble frame, beyond these things, what more could I request? <70>

**Summary**

The article presents the classic Chinese poem "River Village" (江村) by Du Fu (杜甫), known by his courtesy name Zǐměi (子美), read here via Korean Hanja as Tu Ong and Chami. The poem depicts the serene and simple life in a riverside village during a long summer, detailing the natural surroundings and quiet domestic activities. Despite suffering from illness, the poet expresses contentment with this humble existence. From a historical perspective, the inclusion of this revered Chinese poem in a Korean colonial-era magazine highlights the continued appreciation of classical East Asian literary heritage. It might implicitly assert a cultural identity distinct from the colonizer's, finding resonance in Du Fu's themes of endurance and finding peace amidst hardship, potentially reflecting the sentiments of Koreans during that period.
