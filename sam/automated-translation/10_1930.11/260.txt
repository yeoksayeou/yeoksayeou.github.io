Article Title: 黃鶴樓 (Yellow Crane Tower)
Author: 崔호
Article Type: 시 (Poem)

First-rate regulated verse from the ~300 years of the Tang Dynasty (?)
The person of old already rode the yellow crane away,
The yellow crane, once gone, does not return again.
Clearly visible on the clear river, the trees of Hanyang;

Here remains only the empty Yellow Crane Tower.
White clouds for a thousand years drift empty and endlessly.
Fragrant grass grows lush on Yellow Crane Islet;
Misty waves on the river make one feel sorrowful.<70>

**Summary**

This article presents the famous classical Chinese poem "Yellow Crane Tower" by the Tang dynasty poet Cui Hao (崔顥), rendered here under the Korean reading of his name, Ch'oe Ho (崔호). The poem reflects on the legend of an immortal riding away on a yellow crane from the tower, lamenting the irrevocable passage of time and the feeling of emptiness and sorrow evoked by the unchanged scenery (the tower, clouds, river, grass) contrasted with the immortal's absence. From the perspective of Korean colonial history, the inclusion of this iconic Chinese poem in a Korean magazine could signify a continued appreciation for shared East Asian classical culture among intellectuals, potentially serving as an aesthetic escape or a subtle expression of longing and loss resonant with the contemporary situation.
