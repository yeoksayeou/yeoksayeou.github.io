Sijo: Random Thoughts Recorded

"Kŭmgang"

Hearing Kŭmgang was so fine, I let spring and autumn pass,
Wishing to see its true face after falling flowers and leaves had all scattered.
At a time neither summer nor winter, I have come seeking you.<172>

It winds and surges over, unfurls and turns around;
Mountains like mountains, water like water.
Living out one's destined span and dying – I see it here for the first time.

Fallen flat, face down, lying down, collapsed,
Standing, sitting, crawling, running –
They die and come alive again; I know not what to make of it.

Being neither this nor that, each different in its own way,
That again becomes that, and yet again that becomes this.
That, truly being that, is again not that.

If stone, all stone; if water, all water.
Is it stone heard by the ear? Is it water smelled by the nose?
Meaning to grasp the flowers and birds, I stand with hands raised.

A desire to burst out crying aloud,
A desire to burst out laughing loudly.
In the end, unable to cry or laugh, I just gaze blankly.

When Kŭmgang is joyful, the laughter is twelve thousand too;
When Kŭmgang is sorrowful, the tears are twelve thousand too.
Eruhwa! The twelve thousand peaks weep and laugh together.

Kŭmgang is a thousand, ten thousand, a hundred million.
Each person who sees it says it's different each time they look.
There's no way to count the number of Kŭmgang masses.

Hearing "good, good," I merely thought it might be so.
Ah, indeed! I did not know; I did not know it was *this* good.
Kŭmgang, it seems, is not just to be seen, but to be felt.

If asked about Kŭmgang, just say it is good.
Do not ever babble about how it is this way or that.
Beyond the single phrase "It is simply good," there is nothing more to say.

Kyŏngju

With the shadow of Tabot'ap (多寶塔), how many eras have been measured?
The pillars of Pulguksa (佛國寺) Temple are sorrowful in every aged wrinkle.
The moonlight, as if sympathetic, wraps around the pillars and weeps.<173>

Deep in the night within the palace, luxury must have flourished,
But Silla's (新羅) thousand years of glory fade far beyond the dream.
A piece of broken roof tile, kicked by my foot, rolls away.

Though bodies may have wept and gone under the power of the gold crown,
Souls were captured in the craftsmanship of Sŏkkuram (石窟庵).
Passing travelers in later ages adjust their collars anew in respect.

Oath (盟誓)

As spring unfolds, your body too has unfolded.
Seven long years, how could you have endured them?
Overcome with emotion, grasping hands, we first share sighs.

Your wrinkled face, my heart aches, I cannot bear to look.
Your body has changed; how could the world not have changed too?
With no one to welcome me, where am I to go?

"Let's live like human beings," we pledged to each other.
You are doing your part, but what have I been doing?
Shamelessly grasping your wrist, I called you comrade.

Traveler's Sorrows (旅愁)

Entering this town again, the scenery is different from before.
The world grows younger, only people grow old.
Taking ill-treatment as a side dish to drink, I drunkenly turn to leave.

Tying up lingering affections, one strand for each, forgotten when gone,
Weaving dreams of a senseless world, it is endless.
Tying my traveling shoes again, I gaze at the distant sky.<174>

**Summary**

This collection of Sijo poems, titled "Random Thoughts Recorded," presents reflections triggered by visiting Mount Kŭmgang and the historical sites of Kyŏngju, followed by poems about a personal reunion ("Oath") and the melancholy of travel ("Traveler's Sorrows"). The Kŭmgang poems express awe at the mountain's multifaceted and overwhelming nature, suggesting it must be felt rather than described. The Kyŏngju poems reflect on the ephemeral nature of past glory (Silla Dynasty) contrasted with the enduring legacy of cultural artifacts like Pulguksa and Sŏkkuram. "Oath" touches on the hardships and changes endured over time, possibly hinting at political or social struggles, while "Traveler's Sorrows" conveys a sense of alienation and weariness. From a colonial history perspective, the poems are significant for their use of the traditional Korean Sijo form during a period of Japanese assimilation pressure. The focus on iconic Korean landscapes (Kŭmgang) and historical sites (Kyŏngju, Silla) can be interpreted as a quiet assertion of national identity and cultural heritage. The poem "Oath," with its mention of changed appearances, hardship, and a shared pledge, might subtly allude to the struggles faced by Koreans, possibly activists or intellectuals, under colonial rule, while "Traveler's Sorrows" hints at a sense of displacement or disillusionment common during that era.

「金剛」

금강이 하 좋다 하길내 봄 가을 다 버리고
낙화 낙엽 다 진뒤에 참 얼골이 보고저워
여름도 겨울도 아닌 때에 너를 찾어 왔노라.<172>

휘감어 넘어가고 휘풀녀 도라드니
산 같은 산이로다 물 같은 물이로다.
제 명에 살다 죽는 걸 예와 처음 보누나.

자빠진 놈 어퍼진 놈 누었는 놈 쓰러진 놈
슨 놈 앉인 놈과 기는 놈 뛰는 놈이
죽었다 살었다 하니 어쩔줄을 모를네.

이도 저도 아닌 체로 제대로 다르다가
그게 도루도루 또 그래도 그게 드니
그것이 그예 그건체 다시 그게 아닙네.

돌이면 다 돌이요 물이면 다 물이요.
귀로 듯는 돌이어니 코로 맛는 물이어니
꽃과 새 짚일 뜻해서 손을 들고 섰었소.

버럭 소릴 내여 울어보고 싶은 마음
왈칵 소릴 질너 웃어보고 싶은 마음
나종엔 울도 웃도 못하고 멍하니만 보느니

금강이 깃불 때면 웃음도 일만 이천
금강이 슬플 때면 눈물도 일만 이천
에루화 일만 이천 봉이 함께 울고 웃누나.

금강은 천이로다 만이요 억이로다.
본 사람 저마다가 볼제마다 달다거니
한 덩이 금강 수효를 헤아릴 길 없어라.

좋다 좋다길내 그러량만 역였드니
올쿠려 내 몰났소 이리 졸 졸을 내 몰랐소.
금강은 볼 것이 아니고 늣길 건가 보외다.

금강을 뭇 들낭 좋트라만 해두시요.
어떠코 어떠트라 뇌까리든 행여마오.
한 마듸 그저 좋탄 말 밖게 더 할말이 없느니

慶州

多寶塔 그림자로 몇 세원을 재였거니
佛國寺 늙은 기둥 주룸마다 슬프구나.
달빛이 알심있는 양 기둥 감고 우드라.<173>

기푼 밤 대궐 안에 호강도 극성트니
新羅 천년 영화가 꿈밖으로 멀어지고
깨여진 기와 한 조각 발에 채여 도누나.

금관 권세 밑에 몸은 울고 갔을망정
石堀岩 솜씨에다 넋은 담어 놓았거니
후세에 지나든 손이 옷깃 다시 염의네.

盟誓
풀어지는 봄이라고 네 몸 따라 풀녓구나
일곱해 긴 세월을 하마어이 참엇든가
복바처 잡는 손길에 한숨 먼저 나누나

주룸쌀 재핀 얼골 마음 아퍼 못 보겠네
네 몸이 변햇거늘 세상이라 않 변하랴
마저줄 사람 없는데 어느 곳을 가려노

사람 노릇 해보자고 서로서로 맹세트니
너는 할 일 하건 만은 나는 무엇 하단말이
뻔뻔이 손목 잡으며 동무라곤 했구나

旅愁

이 고장 다시 드니 풍정이 예와 달너
세상은 젊어가고 사람만 늙어간다.
괄세를 안주 삼어서 취해도라 가노라.

가면 잊을 사정 한 줄씩 서로 매고
문의없는 세상 꿈을 짜내느니 끝없구나.
들메를 다시 매구서 뭔 하눌을 보노라.<174>
<172-174>
