Dutch East Indies: 1,200,000 people,
United States: 80,000 people,

**Summary**

This short article from the May 1938 issue of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine provides a list of estimated overseas Chinese populations in various countries and regions, totaling approximately 10 million. The locations listed are predominantly in Southeast Asia, along with the United States, India, and Hawaii. For historians studying Korean colonial history, the article is interesting primarily for its use of the term "支那人" (Jina-in / Shina-jin) to refer to Chinese people, a term common in Japanese imperial discourse during the Second Sino-Japanese War (which began in 1937). Its publication in a popular Korean magazine reflects the pervasiveness of Japanese geopolitical perspectives and terminology in colonial Korea during this period.
