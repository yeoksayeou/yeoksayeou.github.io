**Body Text Translation:**
Though the League of Nations is known as the creation of American President Wilson, in reality, it merely actualized the theory already present in *De jure belli ac pacis* (戰爭及平和論, On the Law of War and Peace), written back in 1625 by the famous Dutch (和蘭) scholar Hugo Grotius (후-고구로치스).

However, it is said that this Grotius was also temporarily imprisoned due to political enemies (政敵), suffered for many years, then escaped by getting inside a bag like a bundle of books, continued his writing, but was chased from his homeland (조국) his whole life (終生) and died abroad (객사하엿다) in poverty (貧苦) in some village in France (佛國).

Those who do great things often cannot die comfortably in their beds (臥席終身 못하는 법이야)! <21>

**Summary**

This short piece recounts an anecdote about Hugo Grotius, the 17th-century Dutch scholar. It notes that his work *On the Law of War and Peace* contained the theoretical basis for the League of Nations, long before President Wilson. The article then briefly describes Grotius's imprisonment due to political enemies, his famous escape, and his eventual death in poverty while exiled in France. The piece concludes with the reflection that great individuals often face hardship and do not die peacefully at home. From a historical perspective, this article shows Korean interest in international affairs and Western intellectual history during the colonial period. The final sentence, lamenting the difficult ends often met by significant figures, could perhaps be read by historians as an indirect commentary on the fates of prominent Koreans under Japanese rule, subtly equating suffering and exile with historical importance.

雜談室, 客死한 學者
국제연맹이라 하면 미국대통령 윌손의 산물인줄 알지만은 실상은 1625년에 벌서 和蘭의 유명한 학자 「후-고구로치스」가 지은 「戰爭及平和論」속에 이론으로 잇는 것을 실제화 하엿슴에 불과하다고. 그런데 그 구로치스도 政敵 따문에 일시 투옥되어 다년 신음하다가 가방 속에 책자 모양으로 드리안저 탈옥하여 그 저술을 게속하엿다는데 終生 조국에서는 쫏기어 佛國 엇든 村에서 貧苦 중에 객사하엿다 한다. 큰 일 하는 분은 臥席終身 못하는 법이야! ＜21＞
