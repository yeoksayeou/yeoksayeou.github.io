Company Announcement = Part 3 =

During the Sambok [three hottest days of summer], for the purpose of cooling off (納凉), we intend to invite renowned figures (名士) with experience traversing (踏破) world-famous mountains (世界名山) and widely hold mountain lectures (山岳講演會) and also literature lectures (文藝講演會).

(For things to do in the summer, this is the priority for now (爲先)).

**Summary**

This short announcement from the magazine *Samch'ŏlli* states their intention to organize lectures during the summer's hottest period ("Sambok"). They plan to invite experts who have climbed famous mountains worldwide, as well as speakers for literature lectures, offering these events as a form of "cooling off" for the public. From a historical perspective, this notice highlights the cultural activities undertaken by Korean publications during the colonial era, attempting to provide educational and recreational content, possibly fostering national consciousness through shared cultural experiences and exposure to broader world knowledge, even under restricted circumstances.
