聞砧聲
						韓龍雲

Hearing the Fulling Block Sound
						Han Yong-un

Where does the sound of the fulling block come from?
The whole room fills naturally with cold.
Do not say heavenly clothes are warm,
How can they compare to the chill in these slight bones?

咏燈影

Singing of the Lamp's Shadow

The night is cold, the window like water,
Lying down, I watch the second lamp.
Where the double light does not reach,
Still, I feel ashamed before the Zen monk.

贈古友禪話

Zen Talk Presented to an Old Friend

Seeing all the hundred flowers is truly lovely,
Trampling fragrant grasses crisscross through mist and haze.
Yet, the single cold plum tree (寒梅) cannot be obtained,
What about the snow and wind covering the whole ground?

見櫻花有感

Feeling Upon Seeing Cherry Blossoms

Last winter's snow was like flowers,
This spring's flowers are like snow.
Both snow and flowers are not real (非眞),
Why does my heart feel like tearing apart?

秋雨

Autumn Rain

How desolate the autumn rain,
A slight chill startles me for no reason.
Thoughts like flying cranes,
Follow the clouds into the Emperor's Capital (帝京).

咏雁三首

Three Poems Singing of Wild Geese

One wild goose, the sound of autumn is distant,
A few stars, the color of night is deep.
The lamp burns deep, alone I haven't slept,
[Illegible Character/O] official asks about returning home.

At horizon's end, one wild goose cries,
The whole room fills with the long sound of autumn.
Speaking beyond the moonlit reeds,
What round-tongued form is there?

室中贈別

Farewell Gift in the Room

Meeting in the world is not easy,
Parting within a room is also strange.
The old promise (舊盟) is still not cold,
Do not betray the time of the yellow flowers (黃花期).

病室后園

Back Garden of the Sickroom

People who talk of Zen are also worldly,
Weaving a net, what kind of monk am I?
Most pitiable are the falling yellow leaves,
Grasping autumn, originally without end.

雪夜

Snowy Night

Four mountains surround the house, snow like the sea,
The quilt (衾) cold as iron, dreams like ash.
Through the [Illegible Character] window, still have [Illegible Character] cannot get,
At night, hearing the bell sound, where does it come from?

(From a certain place, ten autumns ago) <46>

**Summary**

This collection presents nine short poems by Han Yong-un, written in classical Chinese style (Hansi). The poems explore themes of solitude, the passage of seasons (especially autumn and winter), nature's ephemeral beauty (flowers, snow, geese), and Buddhist reflections on impermanence and the struggle for detachment. A sense of coldness, longing, desolation, and perhaps confinement pervades the verses, hinting at personal suffering or displacement. For historians, these poems offer insight into the inner world of a prominent Korean intellectual, Buddhist monk, and independence activist during the early colonial period. They showcase the use of traditional poetic forms to express complex personal emotions that may also reflect the somber national atmosphere under Japanese rule, blending aesthetic sensibility with subtle undercurrents of melancholy and resilience.

聞砧聲
						韓龍雲
聞砧聲
何處砧聲至  滿室自生寒
莫道天衣煖  敦如微骨寒

咏燈影
夜冷窓如水  臥看第二燈
雙光不到處  依舊愧禪僧

贈古友禪話
看盡百花正可愛  從橫芳草踏烟霞
一樹寒梅將不得  其如滿地雪風何

見櫻花有感
昨冬雪如花  今春花如雪
雪花共非眞  如何心欲裂

秋雨
秋雨何蕭瑟  微寒空自驚
有思如飛鶴  隨雲入帝京

咏雁三首
一雁秋聲遠  數星夜色多
燈深獨未宿  O吏問歸家
天涯一雁呌  滿室秋聲長
道破芦月外  有何圓舌相

室中贈別
天下逢未易  室中別亦奇
舊盟猶未冷  莫負黃花期

病室后園
談禪人亦俗  結網我何僧
最憐黃葉落  摯秋原無絶

雪夜
四山圍家雪如海  衾寒如鐵夢如灰
X窓猶有X不得  夜聞鐘聲何處來
