**Summary**

This article from the first issue of Samch'ŏlli magazine presents a collection of short slogans contributed by seven prominent Korean figures in 1929. The slogans collectively emphasize themes of unity, dedication to work, cooperation, national effort, focusing on fundamental tasks, converging diverse efforts, and prioritizing practical results over abstract theory. For historians, this piece offers a valuable glimpse into the mindset and priorities of Korean nationalist leaders during the colonial period, highlighting their calls for collective action, self-strengthening, and practical nation-building strategies within the constraints of Japanese rule. The emphasis on "foundation work" and "results" reflects a pragmatic approach to national development.
