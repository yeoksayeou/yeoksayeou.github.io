Seizure Record

Both literary movements coincide temporally. - Hong Myŏnghŭi

They have separate objectives, but their expression and methods are the same. - Kim Kijin

Though opposing literatures, they cooperate (提携) at points of mutual benefit (彼此). - Kim Hyŏngwŏn

There is no congruence in subject matter and expression. - I Ryang

Proletarian literature has nothing to expect from nationalist literature. - Yi Kiyŏng

Literature is not politics. The two literatures remain resolutely opposed. - Pak Yŏnghŭi <33>

**Summary**

This short article, titled "Seizure Record," presents brief statements from six prominent Korean literary figures of the late 1920s (Hong Myŏnghŭi, Kim Kijin, Kim Hyŏngwŏn, I Ryang, Yi Kiyŏng, Pak Yŏnghŭi) offering contrasting views on the relationship between two unnamed, but likely implicitly proletarian and nationalist, literary movements. Opinions range from seeing temporal coincidence or shared methods despite different goals, to potential cooperation, to outright incompatibility in subject matter or fundamental opposition. The title strongly implies that these statements, or the broader discussion they were part of, were subject to censorship and seizure by colonial authorities. Historians would find interest in the explicit articulation of different perspectives on the contentious relationship between left-wing (proletarian) and nationalist cultural movements under Japanese rule, and the ever-present reality of censorship shaping public discourse.
