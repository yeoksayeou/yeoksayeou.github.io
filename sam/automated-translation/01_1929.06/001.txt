Regarding this company's newly selected "Eight Views of the Peninsula" (半島八景), eight leading figures of the current literary world (現文壇) and various master painters (畵伯諸氏) have decided to personally traverse these superb landscapes (絶景) and take up their pens [lit. brush handles] to introduce the magnificent scenery (山水紹介). Because of this, starting from next month's issue of this magazine, it will present a grand spectacle (一大壯觀).

**Summary**

This announcement from *Samch'ŏlli* magazine informs readers about an upcoming feature series titled "Eight Views of the Peninsula." The magazine has commissioned eight prominent contemporary writers and various master painters to personally visit these selected scenic locations across Korea and produce articles and artwork showcasing them. The editors promise this collaboration will create a "grand spectacle" in future issues, starting the following month. From a historical perspective, this initiative is interesting as it reflects a colonial-era effort to define and promote Korean landscapes. Historians might examine the selection of the "Eight Views," the identities of the participating writers and artists, and the nature of their depictions to understand how Korean geography and culture were being framed and consumed during this period, whether as an assertion of national identity, a promotion of tourism under colonial oversight, or a complex mix of both.
