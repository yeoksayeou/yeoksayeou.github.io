Thoughts of Home
						Yŏsu

Lying in a field of grass on a quiet spring midday,
Thinking of the old hometown where I grew up,
The clouds are distant, it must be a thousand *ri* away!
My thoughts are distant, it must be a thousand *ri* away!

Following the swallows flying south,
Let's go find the way to the forgotten hometown.
My aged parents, my young siblings,
The hometown I left behind, hard to forget. <47>

**Summary**

This short poem expresses a profound sense of longing and nostalgia for the speaker's hometown. Resting in a field, the speaker is overwhelmed by the immense distance separating them from their home, parents, and siblings, a distance emphasized by the recurring "thousand *ri*." The desire to return is so strong they imagine following migrating swallows back. From the perspective of Korean colonial history (1929), the poem resonates with themes of separation and displacement, common experiences during a period marked by economic hardship, migration for work (within Korea, to Japan, or Manchuria), and a general sense of loss under colonial rule. Historians might find it illustrative of the personal, emotional toll of these societal changes on ordinary individuals.
