Company Announcement
						Samch'ŏlli-sa (三千里社)

1. Let's make a magazine that is much cheaper in price.
2. Let's make a magazine that anyone can read and has no articles worth discarding.
3. Let's make a good magazine that benefits the masses.

These three points are the fundamental editorial policies of the 『Samch'ŏlli (三千里)』 magazine. However, for the inaugural issue, many weighty and lengthy treatises, starting with those by Messrs. Song Chin-u (宋鎭禹), Han Yong-un (韓龍雲), and Chu Yo-han (朱耀翰), unfortunately ended up that way [i.e., unavailable/missing], so we unavoidably had to supplement with miscellaneous writings instead. Consequently, it has become somewhat lacking like this, but starting from issue number 2, it will become substantial. We hope that you, our readers, will continue to read it devotedly for a long time. Additionally, we are establishing sales outlets in major locations, so those interested, please request the sales outlet internal regulations.

**Summary**

This announcement from the Samch'ŏlli Company outlines the three core principles for its new magazine, *Samch'ŏlli*: affordability, universal appeal with no filler content, and benefit to the masses. It apologizes for the perceived weakness of the inaugural issue, blaming the unavailability of planned major articles by prominent figures like Song Chin-u, Han Yong-un, and Chu Yo-han, and promising improvements from the second issue onwards. The notice also calls for potential distributors. From a historical perspective, this text reveals the aspirations of a Korean publisher in the late 1920s under Japanese colonial rule to create accessible and meaningful content for a broad Korean audience, despite apparent difficulties in securing contributions from key intellectuals, hinting at the potentially challenging political or logistical environment for nationalist-leaning publications. The emphasis on being "beneficial to the masses" suggests a possible enlightenment or nationalist undertone common in that era.

社告
						삼천리사
1. 훨신 갑이 싼 잡지를 만들자
2. 누구든지 볼 수 있고 또 버릴 기사라고 업는 잡지를 만들자
3. 민중에게 이익되는 조흔 잡지를 만들자
이 세 가지는 『三千里』잡지의 편집상 근본 방침이외다. 다만 창간호는 宋鎭禹, 韓龍雲, 朱耀翰씨를 위시하야 가장 무게 잇고 또 장편이든 논문 다수가 그만 그러케되어 부득이 잡문을 그 대신 보충하기로 되엇슴으로 이와가티 다소 빈약하게 되엇사오나 2號부터는 충실하게 될 터이오니 여러분께서는 길이 두텁게 애독하여 쥬심을 바라나이다. 그러고 주요 각 처에 판매소를 설치하오니 유의하신 분은 판매소 內規을 請하여 쥬압소서.
