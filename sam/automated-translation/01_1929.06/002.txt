Company Announcement = Part 2 =

Taking the opportunity presented by the newly selected "Eight Views of the Peninsula" (半島八景) to promote the grand undertaking of traversing our mountains and rivers, our company intends to host and implement sightseeing groups (探勝團) or mountaineering associations (山岳征服會) for each scenic spot. Details will follow later.

**Summary**

This brief announcement states the magazine Samch'ŏlli's plan to organize tours and mountaineering groups to visit the newly selected "Eight Views of the Peninsula." The goal is to encourage people to travel and experience Korea's landscapes. From a historical perspective, this piece is interesting as it reflects an effort to promote domestic tourism and perhaps cultivate a sense of national landscape appreciation during the Japanese colonial period. It shows the magazine actively engaging readers beyond just publishing articles, potentially fostering a shared cultural experience focused on the Korean peninsula itself.
