**Body Text Translation:**
The Second Sino-Japanese War and Pacification Posters
						From the Cabinet Information Department and the Army Ministry

Regarding the current Sino-Japanese Incident, there are dozens of Japanese wartime posters created for operations targeting the Chinese populace (支那民衆), and here we show a few examples among them. Originally, in wartime, while there are many posters meant to inspire (鼓舞) the spirit of one's own nation's people, posters meant to pacify (宣撫) the enemy army and the enemy side's (彼쪽) populace are also common (흔한). Those gathered here are a few examples from among them.

During the Great European War (歐州大戰)
Posters distributed by Germany (獨逸) and the Allied Powers (聯合軍側)

**Summary**

This article, sourced from the Japanese Cabinet Information Department and Army Ministry, introduces propaganda posters used by Japan during the Second Sino-Japanese War. It explains that such wartime posters serve dual purposes: boosting domestic morale and pacifying enemy soldiers and civilians through targeted messaging ("pacification work"). The article notes that dozens of such posters were created and mentions it will show a few examples, also drawing a parallel to poster usage by Germany and the Allies during World War I. From a Korean colonial history perspective, this piece is significant as it appeared in a Korean magazine (Samch'ŏlli), demonstrating how Japanese wartime propaganda about the conflict in China was disseminated within Korea. It highlights the mobilization of colonial subjects into the empire's wartime narratives and showcases the specific propaganda strategies employed by the Japanese state, presented matter-of-factly through official channels.
