Author: 盧天命
Article Type: 시 (Poem)

In the room where the lamp wick is like a thread-snake, holding primeval peace,
The men's guest room (사랑방), where cow fodder is prepared, is always simmering,
The village school children, liking old tales, listened intently every evening.

The ch'ŏmji (첨지), who weaves shoes, still a bachelor at fifty,
Today too, fiddling and fiddling with the toe tips of the hemp sandals (미투리), feels good for no reason,
In the story, a September mountain deer dropped its young.<232>

**Summary**

This short poem by No Ch'ŏnmyŏng depicts a serene and timeless rural Korean village scene. It evokes a sense of peace through images like the lamplit room, the warm guest room where fodder is prepared, storytelling, and the quiet satisfaction of an old craftsman. The poem focuses on simple, traditional elements of village life. From a historical perspective, the poem, published in 1938 during the Japanese colonial period, is interesting for its apparent detachment from contemporary political realities. Historians might analyze it as an example of pastoral escapism, a quiet assertion of enduring Korean cultural identity through depictions of traditional life, or perhaps even a subtle compliance with cultural policies that encouraged apolitical themes.

村景
						盧天命
등잔 심지가 실뱀같은 방 안엔 태곳적 평화를 담고
소여물을 삼는 사랑방은 늘 끌어
글방 아이들은 옛말이 좋아 저녁마다 꽤 들었다.

나이가 쉰에도 총각인 신 삼는 첨지는
오늘도 미투리 코ㅅ날을 만지며 만지며 괜이 좋구
얘기 속엔 9월 산 노루가 알을 빠티렀다.＜232＞
