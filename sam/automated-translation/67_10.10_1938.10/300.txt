Meeting Irie Takako
						From Tokyo, Mun Yebong

On my way here to Tokyo for the sound recording of "Military Train" (軍用列車), I toured the Nikkatsu film studio and there, I happened to meet Irie Takako, who was in the midst of filming. As I had seen several of her works, from "Taki no Shiraito" (瀧の白系) to the recent "A Husband's Chastity" (良人の貞操) and "The Love of Tōjūrō" (藤十郞の戀), she was someone whose face was already familiar from the screen, so it didn't feel like meeting a friend for the first time. Different from her made-up face, that day she was just as she was with her natural face (素顔), allowing me to deeply glimpse her character as well, which was quite pleasant.

We talked about various things concerning movies. When I invited her to come visit Chosŏn (朝鮮) once, she said, laughing, that she definitely wants to visit sometime. As befitting the daughter of an aristocrat, she seemed to possess much education and grace. <163>

**Summary**

The author, Korean actress Mun Yebong, recounts meeting the famous Japanese actress Irie Takako at the Nikkatsu studio in Tokyo. Mun Yebong found Irie familiar from her films and was pleased to meet her in person without makeup, observing her refined character, which she attributed to Irie's aristocratic background. Irie Takako expressed a desire to visit Korea. From a historical perspective, the article offers insight into the cultural interactions between Korean and Japanese film personalities during the colonial period, showcasing a Korean actress's perspective on a top Japanese star and the seemingly normal exchange occurring within the Japanese empire's cultural sphere. Historians might find the casual mention of travel, studio visits, and cross-cultural interest notable within the colonial context.

入江たか子를 맛나고
						東京에서 文藝峯
「軍用列車」의 녹음으로 이번 東京 왔든 길에 日活 촬영소를 견학하고 거기에서 마츰 출연중인 入江たか子를 맞났읍니다. 그의 작품은 「瀧の白系」를 비롯하야 최근의 「良人の貞操」「藤十郞の戀」에까지 여러 개를 보았는지라 스크린에서 이미 나치 익은 이니만치 초면하는 동무갓지 않었읍니다. 화장한 얼골과 달너 그 날은 「素顔」대로 있어 그의 인품까지 그윽히 였볼 수 있어 퍽으나 유쾌하였읍니다.
우리는 여러 가지로 영화에 대해서 이야기했읍니다. 「朝鮮」에 한 번 오라고 권했드니 긔어히 한 번 가보고 십노라고 웃으며 말합디다. 귀족의 따님이라느니만침 퍽으나 교육과 기품이 있어 보입데다.＜163＞
