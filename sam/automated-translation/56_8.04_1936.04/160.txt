<103> I like movies more than plays, but I cannot watch them often.

As for actresses who left an impression, there are so many, but Mary Pickford, although I cannot see her often anymore, is my favorite; as for male actors, I like Conrad Veidt.

**Summary**

The author, Paek Sin'ae, briefly states her preference for films over theatre, though she regrets not being able to see them frequently. She identifies Mary Pickford as her favorite actress, even though opportunities to see her are diminishing, and Conrad Veidt as her preferred male actor. This short piece is interesting for historians as it reveals the cultural consumption patterns of an educated Korean woman in the 1930s, specifically her engagement with and preference for international (likely American and German) film stars during the Japanese colonial period.

						白信愛
연극보다 영화를 더 좋아 하지만 자조 볼 수는 없음니다. 인상에 남은 녀배우라면 하도 만치만 매리, 픽포-드가 이제는 자조 못보게 되엿지만 제일 맘에 들고요, 남배우로는, 곤랏드파이드가 좋아요.
