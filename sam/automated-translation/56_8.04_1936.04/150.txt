Does a Female Writer Watch Movies?
						Pak Hwasŏng

If people didn't watch movies like me—no, if they *couldn't* watch them like me—movie theater owners would probably go bankrupt. So, in that regard, I'm completely out of the loop. However, there is one actress who left a deep impression. I knew her name until some years ago, but I've forgotten it. The actress who played Nora in the movie adaptation of Ibsen's "A Doll's House" (人形의 家) left a very deep and favorable impression. She really did an excellent job. That actress also appeared as Ch'unhŭi in "Ch'unhŭi" (春姬) and as Salome in "Salome" (살노메).

**Summary**

The author, Pak Hwasŏng, admits she rarely watches films, suggesting movie businesses would fail if everyone were like her. Despite this, she vividly recalls being deeply impressed by an unnamed actress who played Nora in a film version of Ibsen's "A Doll's House," and who also portrayed the title characters in "Ch'unhŭi" (likely Ch'unhyang) and "Salome." This piece offers a glimpse into the perspective of a female intellectual in colonial Korea regarding popular culture, showing limited personal engagement with cinema but awareness of its content, including Western classics (Ibsen), Korean traditional stories, and other foreign adaptations. Historians might find the blending of cultural influences (Western drama, Korean folklore) in the film repertoire mentioned, and the self-described detachment of a female writer from mass entertainment, particularly interesting.

女流作家는 映畵를 보나
						朴花城
나처럼 映畵를 안보면, 아니 못보면 아마 映畵장수는 망할 것임니다. 그러니 그쪽으로는 아주 맥문이지오. 그러나 인상깊은 女優는 하나 꼭 잇습니다. 年前까지도 일음을 알앗는대 그만 잊엇습니다만 입센의 「人形의 家」映畵의 노라로 분장한 女優의 인상이 퍽 깊고 좋와요. 정말 썩 잘합디다. 그 女優가 『春姬』의 春姬로도 나오고 『살노메』의 살노메로도 나옵디다.
