別後獨行
						梁槿煥

別後京鄕萬里身. 朔風抱負獨行辛 靑山變白白雲黑. 綠水成銀柱倒山. 禽獸失粮草木泣 森羅萬像晝窮寒. 人間何處無人子. 有有難逢人若人. 有酒誰與豪氣吐. 有思誰向實情陳. 世人都集向營利 難覓桃園三結仁. 野路行人唯見去. 洞山松折更無新. 吾人何免是天理. 歲歲心身衰不振. 生死自然人盡到. 但悲死後名共淪. 若使知己同生死. 萬死無怨身命懸.

Walking Alone After Parting
						Yang Kŭnhwan

After parting, my body is myriad leagues from capital and country. Embracing ambition against the north wind, walking alone is bitter.
Blue mountains turn white, white clouds turn black. Green waters become silver pillars, reflecting inverted mountains.
Birds and beasts lose their food, grass and trees weep; all myriad things in creation are stark and cold even in daytime.
Where in the human world are there no sons of men? Yet even among them, it's hard to meet a person like a true person.
Though I have wine, with whom can I vent my bold spirit? Though I have thoughts, to whom can I reveal my true feelings?
People of the world all gather seeking profit; it's hard to find the Peach Garden Oath of sworn brotherhood (桃園三結仁).
On the country path, travelers are only seen leaving. The village mountain pine is broken, and no new one grows.
How can we escape this principle of Heaven? Year by year, heart and body weaken and fail.
Life and death are natural; all people arrive there. But it's sad that one's name sinks into oblivion after death.
If only I had a true friend to share life and death, I would face ten thousand deaths without regret, staking my life.

遊一海山莊

一海山莊安得諼. 總是仙景似遊大. 太公不遇渭濱釣. 吾友知時蟄此山. 尺蠖龍蛇機有識. 虎*將搏必低身. 靑山碧海天然美. 果適英雄養浩然.
(贈定州李貞根氏)<97>

Visiting Ilhae Mountain Villa

Ilhae Mountain Villa, how could one forget it? It is entirely a fairy scene, like roaming the vastness.
Duke T'aegong (太公), unrecognized, fished by the Wei River (渭濱). My friend, knowing the times, lies secluded in this mountain.
The inchworm bends, the dragon and snake know their moment; the tiger, about to pounce, surely lowers its body.
The blue mountains and jade sea are naturally beautiful, truly suited for a hero to cultivate a noble spirit (浩然).
(Presented to Mr. Yi Chŏnggŭn of Chŏngju) <97>

**Summary**

The first poem, "Walking Alone After Parting," expresses deep loneliness, disillusionment with a profit-driven society lacking true friendship (symbolized by the Peach Garden Oath), and a lament over the passage of time, decay, and the fear of being forgotten after death. The poet yearns for a kindred spirit with whom to face life and death. The second poem, "Visiting Ilhae Mountain Villa," shifts tone, praising the beauty of the villa as a place of retreat suitable for a wise person or hero (like Duke T'aegong) awaiting the right time, drawing parallels between strategic waiting in nature (inchworm, tiger) and a person cultivating their spirit amidst natural beauty. For historians, these poems reflect a sense of alienation and perhaps quiet resistance or strategic withdrawal felt by some Korean intellectuals during the colonial period. The longing for true connection, the critique of superficial society, and the idealization of retreat and cultivation of inner strength (浩然之氣) in nature could be interpreted as responses to the political and social constraints of the time. The reference to T'aegong suggests a waiting for a time of action or change.
