Progression of the Tokyo Incident - Announced by the Martial Law Command Headquarters

(Tokyo Telephone/Telegram) 4th, 1:30 PM, Martial Law Command Headquarters Announcement
Statement by Martial Law Command Authorities
The outline of the progression of this incident is as follows:

★ (Martial Law Commander, Lieutenant General Kasumi Kaoru)

In the early morning of February 26th, approximately 1,400-odd officers and men belonging to the Konoe Infantry 3rd Regiment, Infantry 1st Regiment, Infantry 3rd Regiment, Field Heavy Artillery 7th Regiment, etc., disrupted military discipline and dared to mobilize illegally, starting a rebellion.
First, they attacked the Prime Minister's Official Residence, the private residence of Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Saitō, the private residence of Inspector General of Military Education Watanabe, the lodging of former Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Makino (Yugawara Itōya Ryokan), the residence of Grand Chamberlain Suzuki, the private residence of Finance Minister Takahashi, etc., causing the immediate deaths of Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Saitō and Inspector General of Military Education Watanabe, inflicting serious injuries on Grand Chamberlain Suzuki and Finance Minister Takahashi (Finance Minister Takahashi died on ■ day). Next, these rebel troops positioned themselves in the vicinity of Nagata-chō, Kōjimachi Ward, and proceeded to cut off internal and external traffic.
Their stated purpose, according to their manifesto, was, amid a grave internal and external crisis, to eliminate the ringleaders of the destruction of the national polity (國體) such as the elder statesmen (元老), senior vassals (重臣), financial cliques (財閥), military cliques (軍閥), bureaucrats (官僚), and political parties (政黨), thereby upholding the great cause and defending and manifesting the national polity.
As the incident occurred, the Garrison Commander immediately commanded the troops stationed in Tokyo to strive for the maintenance of public order, and at the same time, at 3:00 PM, ordered wartime garrison duty for the 1st Division.

◇ Leaflets scattered from airplanes

During this time, parts of the units from Kōfu, Sakura, Kōchi, Utsunomiya, etc., were ordered to enter the capital. These units arrived in the capital respectively on the night of the same day and came under the command of the Garrison Commander. On the following day, the 27th, a partial implementation of martial law was ordered for the relevant area of Tokyo City and newly <404> ■…■ became. However, if strong measures were taken immediately to suppress these rebel troops, there was concern it would invite a ■■■ tragedy. If, unfortunately, a situation arose where gunfire was exchanged, the ■ castle area is frighteningly close to the Imperial Palace, and also includes the residences of the Imperial family, various government offices, foreign legations, and ■■■ residents' homes. The impact on the public mind and the extent of the harm caused would have been immeasurable ■, so to avoid this, while first strictly encircling and monitoring the rebel troops, over three days, efforts were made through fervent persuasion by fellow officers to convince the rebel leaders to return to their original units. However, they still refused to listen, and by the 28th, as they did not obey the Imperial Command Order (奉勅命令), there was finally no choice but to resolve on a forceful ■ settlement. On the night of the 28th, units from Utsunomiya, Matsumoto, Mito, Sendai, Wakamatsu, etc., were ordered into the capital, and after arriving, they each came under the command of the Martial Law Commander. Thus, on the morning of the ■ 29th, residents in the vicinity of Kōjimachi and Nagata-chō were first ordered to evacuate, citizen traffic was halted, and while proceeding towards a forceful resolution against the rebel troops, on the other hand, non-commissioned officers and soldiers were given room to surrender. Through airplanes, tanks, etc., leaflets persuading surrender were scattered, striving to ■ reflection. As a result, officers and soldiers gradually began to surrender one after another, and by the afternoon of the same day, ■ surrendered. They were each disarmed and ■ confined and accommodated in the barracks.

Among the leaders of the ■, Naka Noshirō committed suicide, and most of the others were confined in the Garrison Prison, and the rebellion was suppressed without any exchange of ■ fire. <405>

Metropolitan Police Department Announcement

(Tokyo Telephone/Telegram) Metropolitan Police Department, 4th, 4:30 PM Announcement
At dawn, 5:00 AM on February 26th, upon hearing reports that the Metropolitan Police Department was surrounded by a portion of the army, an emergency call-up ■■■ was immediately carried out. The Superintendent-General and chiefs of various departments and sections gathered immediately, and as a result of contacting military officials, recognizing the gravity of the situation ■■■, it was decided that the suppression of the rebel troops would be handled by the military itself, and the police would dedicate themselves solely to the ■■■ maintenance of general public order. An extraordinary police general headquarters was established at the Kanda Nishiki-chō Police Station, the deployment of subordinate units was determined ■ accordingly, approximately 9,000 police officers from the 82 stations under its jurisdiction and Metropolitan Police Department personnel immediately took up their posts ■. Seen from the perspective of ■, public order in Tokyo was well maintained with a calm and composed attitude ■.
Past 5:00 AM on February 26th, the Prime Minister's Official Residence, the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal's residence, the Finance Minister's residence, and the ■ Inspector General of Military Education Watanabe's residence were attacked by armed troops commanded by some Army officers ■. The ■ Department was also surrounded by powerful military forces, and upon receiving urgent reports of traffic blockades in the entire Nagata-chō area centered around the Army Ministry, the General Staff Headquarters, the Garrison Command Headquarters, the Aviation ■■, the Army Minister's official residence, and the Prime Minister's Official Residence ■, the ■ leadership immediately gathered and conferred. As a result, surmising that the incident was not merely an attack by some officers but an action by units belonging to the chain of command, they immediately requested ■■ Tokyo ■■ the Tokyo Garrison Command Headquarters that the suppression of the rebel troops be done by the military's hand ■. Given this situation, unless the rebel troops took active measures against the police officers ■, it was a separate issue, but otherwise, acting [against them] would result in many sacrifices ■, potentially becoming a full-scale ■ conflict between the military and the police, further expanding the disruption of public order and leading to a situation where the incident could not be resolved. Therefore, they decided on an attitude of striving to avoid conflict and calmly and composedly undertaking the maintenance of public order.
Meanwhile, at 5:30 AM, an emergency summons order was issued to all police officers under its jurisdiction, the Extraordinary Security General Headquarters was ■ established at the Kōjimachi Station, department and section chiefs gathered, security directives were issued to the chiefs of all subordinate stations, and at the same time, deployments were decided. By 7:30 ■, the deployment of negotiators was completed, and each department and station also performed their respective designated duties.

At 3:00 PM, the Wartime Garrison Order was proclaimed, and on ■ 20 <406> at 7:55 PM, it came under the command of the Martial Law Commander, ■ handling affairs under martial law, and gradually recovering to a normal state. During this time, the guarded locations continued to include protection of high officials, ■■ guarding of critical locations, ■■■■■■■, ■■ of ■■, crime ■ prevention, prevention, etc., were emphasized. Therefore, the city, excluding a part of the area where the rebel troops were located, maintained ■■ almost normal conditions.
The police telephone and communication facilities continued traffic transmission and reception continuously while under the siege of the rebel troops since the incident began.

**Summary**

This article from the April 1936 issue of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine provides a pictorial report and official accounts of the February 26 Incident in Tokyo. It details the initial uprising by approximately 1,400 Imperial Japanese Army soldiers, their attacks on key government officials and locations, and the stated aim of eliminating perceived threats to the "national polity." The piece includes announcements from the Martial Law Command and the Metropolitan Police Department outlining the military's response, the declaration of martial law, the strategy of containment followed by persuasion, and the eventual surrender of the rebel troops without major bloodshed in the city center.

For historians studying Korean colonial history, this article is interesting as it shows how major political events in the Japanese metropole were reported in a prominent Korean magazine. The detailed accounts, attributed directly to Japanese authorities (Martial Law Command, Police), highlight the flow of official information into the colony. The focus on the instability within the Japanese military and political elite could be analyzed for how it might have been perceived by Korean readers, potentially offering a glimpse into the vulnerabilities of the colonial power. The inclusion of Japanese names, places, and military units demonstrates the interconnectedness and the dominance of Japanese affairs in the information landscape of colonial Korea.
