White Gull
						Hwagok Yun Ik-sŏn

踏來沙上一群逢
Stepping onto the sand, I encounter a flock,
睡足忌機春草岸
Well-slept, wary of disturbance on the spring grass bank.
點點雪衣冬外冬
Dotting the scene, their snowy coats are winter beyond winter,
飛翔凌駕夏雲峯
Their flight surpasses the peaks of summer clouds.

江淸雨歇問吾興
The river is clear, the rain has stopped; I ponder my own feelings.
遯世偸閒今古士
Like scholars of old and new escaping the world to steal leisure,
海濶魚豊任汝農
The sea is vast, fish abundant—let it be your farming.
聲詩模得這貌容
Can poetry capture this form and appearance?

Strange Rock

百中採一石工良
A fine stonemason selected one from a hundred;
苔面擁鍾稍自若
Its mossy face embraces the bell [shape?], calm and composed.
赤白靑黃備五章
Red, white, blue, yellow—it possesses the five patterns [colors],
文身磅磚不尋常
Its patterned body, massive and broad, is extraordinary.

每從秘苑玉流畔
Always beside the Okryuch'ŏn stream in the Secret Garden (秘苑),
幾歲送迎觀賞客
For how many years has it bid farewell and welcomed admiring visitors?
特立奇花瑤草傍
Standing uniquely beside wondrous flowers and jewel-like grasses,
古如今日壽年長
Ancient as today, its lifespan is long.

Man of Will

處世正當臨事直
In dealing with the world, be upright; in facing matters, be straightforward.
貧寒不敢窮其志<96>
Poverty and cold do not dare exhaust his will;
鏗然特立古猶今
Resolutely standing apart, ancient is like the present.
富貴焉能면我心
How can wealth and honor bend my heart?

百鍊冶爐筯鐵固
Like chopsticks of iron solidified in a forge of hundred refinements,
蓬蒿叢裡一竿竹
A single stalk of bamboo amidst a thicket of mugwort.
萬頃胸海智波深
In the vast sea of his breast, the waves of wisdom are deep;
葉茂千秋餘有陰 <97>
Its leaves flourish for a thousand autumns, leaving a lasting shade.

**Summary**

This article presents three short poems written in Hanja by Yun Ik-sŏn under the pen name Hwagok. The first poem, "White Gull," uses the image of gulls to reflect on freedom, nature's abundance, and the desire for a life removed from worldly concerns. The second, "Strange Rock," describes a unique, ancient rock in the Secret Garden (Piwŏn), celebrating its enduring beauty and steadfastness through time. The third, "Man of Will," praises a person of unwavering integrity and inner strength who remains uncorrupted by poverty or riches, comparing them to refined iron and resilient bamboo. For historians, these poems offer a glimpse into the continuation of traditional literati culture (Hanja poetry) during the colonial period. The themes of integrity ("Man of Will") and retreat ("White Gull") could subtly reflect responses to the pressures of the era, while the appreciation for a specific Korean landmark ("Strange Rock" in Piwŏn) underscores a connection to national heritage.
