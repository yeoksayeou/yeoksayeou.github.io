						金陵人 昇應順

Self-Description, Part 1

A lone shadow, empty by the drifting duckweed shore,
Wherever the autumn wind rises, sorrow forms at once.
My wandering tracks have lasted now for many years,
In the sound of the night rain, I cannot find sleep.

Thinking of home, I tread the moonlit southern bank,
Who truly knows the honors and disgraces of a lifetime?
Missing my brothers, I watch the clouds, gazing at the northern sky,
Having trod the green mountains, again a long river lies ahead.

Self-Description, Part 2

In my life, I loved learning, finding peace only in my heart,
How many years now have I chanted the "Returning Home" ode?
I only love planting willows amidst mountains and water,
Like a racing horse or toiling ox, forgetting warmth and cold.

Visiting Ch'oksŏngnu Pavilion in Chinju Fortress

An ancient fortress in autumn dusk, a sandbar in the setting sun,
The place where heroes (壯士) and a beautiful lady (佳娥; Non'gae) died for their cause.
Outside the pavilion, the long river flows on, empty and indifferent,
The fisherman's song and woodcutter's flute make one sorrowful.<98>

Feelings at Kongju Mountain Fortress

The stubborn foes (堅子; likely Manchus) came from the north, shaking the earth,
His Majesty (至尊; King Injo) hastened across the river in the middle of the night.
The green pines stand intentionally at the fortress base,
The blue waters flow uncaringly around the rocks below.

Autumn Gathering at Kyŏngp'odae Pavilion in Kangnŭng

In beautiful Kangju (江州; old name for Kangnŭng) stands Kyŏngp'odae Pavilion,
The wind is clear; sitting among black bamboo (烏竹), I play the zither.
Poets arriving here deliberately tilt their cups,
Clouds roll back, the moon's reflection (免輪) turns upon the water.

If only my life's body could be kept from aging,
Who can be the master of the scenery in this place?
Inevitably, the hair at my temples hastens day by day,
A shepherd boy (牧兒) comes gathering autumn sounds, playing his flute.

Elegy for My Esteemed Teacher's Eternal Rest

A life of seventy years was spent in worldly turmoil (風塵),
Worrying for the nation for a hundred years (憂國百年), his merits covered the world.
Overnight, he has become a spirit in the Buddha land (佛地神),
Saving lives throughout his transformation, his virtue surpassed others.<99>

**Summary**

This collection of poems by Sŭng Ŭngsun, titled "Several Recent Poems," encompasses personal reflections on a life of wandering, scholarly pursuits, and enduring hardship, alongside visits to significant historical sites in Korea. The poet contemplates the passage of time, personal displacement, the beauty of nature at Kyŏngp'odae, and the historical weight of places like Chinju Fortress (Ch'oksŏngnu) and Kongju Mountain Fortress, sites associated with resistance and royal refuge during invasions. The collection concludes with a heartfelt elegy for a respected teacher. For historians, these poems offer a glimpse into the mindset of a Korean intellectual during the colonial period. While avoiding direct political statements, the choice of historical locations linked to Korean resilience and tragedy (Imjin War, Manchu invasions) and the themes of sorrow, displacement, and endurance can be seen as subtle expressions of national consciousness and historical lament under Japanese rule. The blend of personal sentiment, historical awareness, and appreciation for Korean landscapes provides insight into cultural life and values during that era.

						金陵人 昇應順
自述 其一

孤影虛無萍水邊
秋風起處輒成恨
漂流踪跡己多年
夜雨聲中不得眼

思家步月登南臯
榮辱平生誰自識
憶弟看雲望北天
靑山踏去又長川

自述 其二

平生好學獨心安
歸去詞吟今幾載
只愛種柳山水間
馬奔牛役忘暖寒

遊晉陽城矗石樓

古城秋暮夕陽洲
壯士佳娥殉節地
樓外長江空自流
漁歌樵笛使人愁<98>

公州山城有感

堅子北方動地來
蒼松有意城底立
至尊夜半渡河催
碧水無心岩下廻

拾秋江陵鏡浦臺

佳麗江州有鏡臺
風淸烏竹彈琴坐
詩人到此故傾盃
雲捲免輪映水廻

可使吾生身不老
斯間景物誰能主
無何鬢髮日相催
牧兒拾秋弄笛來

輓恩師永眼

生涯七十是風塵
憂X百年功盖世
一夜輒成佛地神
濟生一化德過人<99>
