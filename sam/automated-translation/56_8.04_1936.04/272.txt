Ch'unwŏn of the 'Dead Tree Blooms' Theory

Upon hearing that Mr. Cho Mansik (曺晩植氏) had come up to Sŏul one day the winter before last to hospitalize his now-deceased wife (夫人) at Severance (세부란쓰) Hospital, Yi Kwangsu (李光洙氏) said:

"Huh, it's like a dead tree blooming (枮木生花)! Now Mr. Cho (曺先生) will belatedly marry a female student (女學生). What an amorous fortune (艶福者)! "<138>

**Summary**

This short news item reports a remark made by the famous writer Yi Kwangsu (pen name Ch'unwŏn) about the politician Cho Mansik. Hearing that Cho had brought his late wife to Severance Hospital in Sŏul two winters prior, Yi commented that it was like a "dead tree blooming," predicting that the widowed Cho would now belatedly marry a younger woman ("female student") and calling him lucky in love. From a historical perspective, this piece offers a glimpse into the personal interactions and public gossip surrounding prominent Korean figures during the colonial period. It highlights contemporary social commentary, particularly regarding remarriage and age differences, as reported in popular magazines like *Samch'ŏlli*.
