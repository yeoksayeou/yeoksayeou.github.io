Waiting
						P'ain

Since you said you would come in the flower-blooming season,
Did you mean the third month of spring?

The azaleas in Yŏngbyŏn
Cannot but bloom,
Yet even after Samjinnal has passed,
This year there is no trace.

Because I climb the hill every day,
The front of my skirt has torn.
<115>

**Summary**

This short poem by "P'ain" expresses the sorrow and anticipation of someone waiting for a person who promised to return during the spring flower season. The speaker notes that even though the time for azaleas in Yŏngbyŏn has come and the traditional Samjinnal (3rd day of the 3rd lunar month) has passed, the awaited person has not appeared. The final lines, describing a torn skirt from repeatedly climbing a hill (presumably to look for the person), poignantly convey the persistence and eventual weariness of this waiting. For historians, the poem offers a glimpse into personal expressions of longing during the colonial period. The specific mention of "Yŏngbyŏn" and "azaleas" strongly evokes the imagery used by the famous contemporary poet Kim So-wŏl, potentially placing this poem within that lyrical tradition, and the theme of unfulfilled waiting could be interpreted allegorically in the context of national aspirations, though it reads primarily as a personal lament.
