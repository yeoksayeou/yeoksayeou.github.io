社告 (Company Announcement)

It is said that Hwang Ch'anok, Yi Kŭnbae, and other certain persons are going around the provinces, claiming to be external affairs agents of this company, and collecting advance payments for the magazine and advertising fees. However, this company has absolutely never dispatched such people, so we ask provincial personages to please take note.

From Samch'ŏlli Company <49>

**Summary**

This announcement from the Samch'ŏlli Company warns its readers and potential advertisers about individuals, specifically naming Hwang Ch'anok and Yi Kŭnbae, who are falsely claiming to be company representatives and fraudulently collecting money in the provinces.
