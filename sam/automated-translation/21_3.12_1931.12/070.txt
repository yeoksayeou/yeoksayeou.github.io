**Summary**

This 1931 article from *Samch'ŏlli* magazine lists the typical monthly salary ranges and daily working hours for various female occupations in Seoul. It covers professions from teachers and nurses to factory workers and shop assistants, noting that conductors and factory workers were paid daily wages. The data reveals significant disparities in pay and working hours among different jobs available to women. Historians might find this article valuable for understanding women's labor conditions, the wage structure, and the types of employment accessible to women in colonial Seoul during the early 1930s. The extremely long hours for conductors and shop assistants compared to other professions, alongside the low wages for factory workers, highlight the challenging conditions faced by many working women.
