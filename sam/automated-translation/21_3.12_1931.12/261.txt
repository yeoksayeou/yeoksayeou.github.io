Only in the Past

An old spinster (老嬪) home tutor (家庭敎師) was teaching grammar. When she asked, "If I say 'I am pretty (나는 어엽부오),' is this 'Present (現在)' or Past (過去)?" the female student looked intently at the teacher's face for a while and then said, "That's the Past (過去), isn't it!"<75>

**Summary**

This short piece is a joke published in the magazine *Samch'ŏlli*. An elderly spinster tutor asks her student a grammar question using the example sentence "I am pretty." The student, looking at the aged teacher, cheekily answers that the statement must belong to the past tense. From a historical perspective, this brief joke subtly reflects social perceptions of age and beauty for women in colonial Korea, using humor based on the teacher's presumed spinster status and age. It offers a glimpse into everyday humor and social commentary of the period.
