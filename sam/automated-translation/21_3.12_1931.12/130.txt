Author: Unspecified
Article Type: 소식 (News/Dispatch)

It is said that the managing editor of the *Tong-a Ilbo* (東亞日報) receives XX wŏn each month from the company as confidential funds.

The annual confidential fund for the Tōkyō Metropolitan Police Chief (東京警視總監) is 200,000 wŏn, of which the Chief himself reportedly uses 80,000 wŏn. The rest of the money is said to be distributed and used by the head of the Higher Police Section of the Tōkyō Metropolitan Police Department (警視廳), other department heads, section chiefs, and the heads of the roughly 70 police stations within Tōkyō (東京) city. Most of this money is said to end up in the hands of informants (密偵). Reportedly, 7,000 wŏn was spent on just one case to make an arrest related to a certain thought-related incident (사상관계사건).

Although the Chief of the Police Affairs Bureau (경무국장), the various section chiefs of the Police Affairs Bureau (경무국), and the police chiefs of each province within the Government-General (總督府) also each have certain amounts of confidential funds, hush-hush—anyway, there are rumors that 200,000 wŏn is disbursed annually. <41>

**Summary**

This short news piece from 1931 discusses the allocation of "confidential funds" (기밀비). It mentions sums allegedly given to the *Tong-a Ilbo* editor, the Tōkyō Metropolitan Police Chief (with details on its internal distribution), and officials within the Japanese Government-General of Korea's police apparatus. The article highlights that a significant portion of these funds, particularly in Tōkyō, goes to informants (密偵) and mentions a large sum (7,000 wŏn) spent on a single "thought-related case." For historians, this article offers a glimpse into the financial mechanisms possibly used for controlling information and suppressing dissent during the colonial period, suggesting substantial resources were potentially directed towards surveillance, informants, and policing political or ideological activities by both Japanese authorities and potentially within Korean organizations like newspapers. The mention of "thought-related cases" directly points to the policing of ideologies deemed subversive by the colonial regime.
