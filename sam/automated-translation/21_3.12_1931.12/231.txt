Company Announcement

The November issue of Samch'ŏlli has been out of stock since November 14th. We apologize that we have been unable to send it to individuals or fulfill orders from branch offices. Please forgive us as we will send the December issue as a substitute.

Samch'ŏlli Company Sales Bureau <70>

**Summary**

This is a brief announcement from the Samch'ŏlli Company Sales Bureau apologizing for the November 1931 issue being sold out since mid-November. They state they cannot fulfill further individual or branch office orders for that issue and will substitute the December issue instead. For historians, this short notice indicates the popularity and high demand for *Samch'ŏlli* magazine during the colonial period, to the point where it sold out relatively quickly, potentially highlighting distribution challenges or successful marketing within the constraints of the time.
