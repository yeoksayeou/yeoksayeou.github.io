March (and 3 other pieces)
						P'ain
March

The sun has risen over Asia (아세아)!
Namdaemun Gate (남대문), open up!
Our brave youth
Advance forward!

The once-quiet streets
Now bustle with people's voices,
And in the seemingly empty sky,
Lightning flashes, flashes!

Let's advance, comrades!
Before brave warriors,
Even rocks crumble,
Only happiness protects us.<1>

Woodcutter's Song

In the capital Sŏul (서울), there are so many houses,
They must light fires in kitchen after kitchen,
But the sun sets, and my wood isn't sold.
Refrain~ Buy my wood, buy my wood!
Buy wood that catches fire well!
If I sell my wood, I can buy a doe of rice,
And cut a tail of pollack (갑사랑기),
So our family of three (삼모자) can celebrate New Year's.

Who lives in this tall house?
I shout out, but they pretend not to hear.
Aren't they afraid to celebrate New Year's alone?<2>

Delivering Lunch

Windstorm (바름광풍), don't blow!
My older sister's lunch is getting all cold.
After eating a cold lunch,
Her hand trembles holding the cigarette (담배마리).

A pampered hand with a silver ring,
The more it trembles, the more affection it receives,
But my older sister's hand holding the cigarette,
The more it trembles, the more it's scolded (매청한다).

Windstorm (바름광풍), don't blow!
My older sister's lunch is getting all cold.<3>

Snowy Night

On a snowy night, riding a troika (또로이까),
I want to go,
Singing a sad song to the end of the sky,
Leaving my homeland behind.

From a distant village, the song of a Komosmal'ska (?) (꼼소말가 노래)
Flows in.
With a *** precious Russian (로서아) girl,
I want to dance.

***** *** without *****
*****
Let's soothe ***** ***
*** Open up!

**Summary**

This collection consists of four poems by P'ain published in 1931. "March" expresses a hopeful, nationalistic call for progress and unity among Korean youth. "Woodcutter's Song" depicts the hardship and poverty faced by a woodcutter trying to make a living in Seoul during the New Year season. "Delivering Lunch" contrasts the treatment of a pampered hand with the harsh reality of a working sister whose hand trembles from labour or cold. "Snowy Night" (incomplete) evokes a sense of melancholy and escapism, longing to leave the homeland and find solace elsewhere, possibly referencing Russia. From a historical perspective, the poems reflect the complex socio-economic conditions and underlying national sentiment during the Japanese colonial period. "March" hints at burgeoning resistance or hope for change, while the other poems vividly portray the poverty and struggles of ordinary Koreans ("Woodcutter's Song," "Delivering Lunch") and a desire for escape ("Snowy Night"), offering historians valuable glimpses into the emotional landscape and daily realities of colonial Korea.

行進

아세아에 해도닷다
남대문아 열처라
용감한 우리청년
압흐로 나아간다

고요하든 거리거리
사람소리 들끌코
빈것갓튼 하늘에도
번개불이 번적번적

나아가자 동무들아
용감한 용사압헨
바위라도 부서지고
행복만이 지켜준다<1>

나뭇꾼 타령

서울 장안엔 집도 만쿠나
부억부억에 불을 때련만
해는 저서도 나무 안팔려
후렴~나무들 사오, 나무들 사오
불이 잘 붓는 나무들 사오
나무 팔려야 쌀 한되 사고
갑사랑기도 한꼬리 끈어
우리 삼모자 설을 세겟소

이 놉흔 집은 누가 사는가
소리 웨처도 듯는체 만체
혼자 설 세도 겁이 안나나<2>

점심 나르기

바름광풍 부지마라
언니점심 다식는다
식은점심 잡숫고는
담배마리 손떨닌다

은가락지 소빈손은
떨닐사록 귀염밧고
담배마리 언니손은
떨닐사록 매청한다

바름광풍 부지마라
언니점심 다식는다<3>

눈 날니는밤

눈 날니는 밤 또로이까 타-고
가고십고나
하늘 끗까지 슬푼 노래 부르며
고국 떠나서

먼- 마을엔 꼼소말가 노래가
흘너들닌다
*** 귀한 로서아 색시와
춤추고 십구나

***** *** 업서서
*****
***** *** 달니자
***여라
