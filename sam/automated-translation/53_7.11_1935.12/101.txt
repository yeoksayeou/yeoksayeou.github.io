Unveiling Ceremony for the Memorial Stele Venerating Master Yulgok
						Sop'a Han Chun-sŏk

Master of the Eastern Sea (海東夫子), Yi Mun-sŏng (李文成),
Remembered always (羹墻), his presence forever resides in this schoolyard stone (校庭石).
Heaven and Earth nurtured his essence, granting this profound birth (天地毓精此篤生),
In Confucianism (儒敎), for a thousand autumns, an immortal name (千秋不杇名).

Chrysanthemum Exhibition

The wind is high, trees are bare, late autumn is clear (風高木落晩秋淸),
Men and women like clouds vie to view the exhibition (士女如雲爭展覽).
Cold chrysanthemums bloom profusely, their fragrance fills the city (寒菊盛開香滿城),
Yellows entwined, whites bursting forth, judging their names and types (缠黃綻臼品題名).

Ceaseless Rain

Like a long monsoon, it pours ceaselessly, day through night (若霖不絶晝連宵),
Alas, those ordinary onlookers gazing at the rising waters (噫彼尋常觀漲客).
How many poor, shuttered homes lack firewood (窮蔀幾家龜乏樵)?
Two or three together as companions cross the mountainside (兩三作伴跨山腰).<66>

**Summary**

This piece consists of three short poems in Classical Chinese by Han Chun-sŏk. The first commemorates the unveiling of a memorial stele for the revered Joseon Dynasty Confucian scholar Yi I (Yulgok), celebrating his enduring legacy. The second poem depicts a lively chrysanthemum exhibition during late autumn, capturing a scene of public enjoyment. The third poem shifts tone, lamenting the hardship caused by continuous rain, highlighting the plight of the poor lacking basic necessities. From a historical perspective, the article is interesting as it shows the continuation of traditional cultural practices (honoring Confucian figures) and observations of everyday life (festivals, weather hardships) in Korea during the Japanese colonial period. The reverence for Yulgok could be seen as a subtle assertion of Korean cultural identity, while the poem about rain points to the social realities and struggles faced by ordinary people.
