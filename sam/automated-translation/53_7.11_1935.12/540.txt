The Moon Rising
						P'ain

As the moon rises,
As the wild geese cry,
As the boat departs,
My love goes.

As the flowers bloom,
As the river thaws,
As the swallows come,
My love comes.

Knowing this once,
Who again
Will watch the moon
Rise with me? <297>

**Summary**

This short poem by P'ain expresses a deep sense of longing and separation. The speaker contrasts the cyclical, predictable events in nature – the moon rising, geese crying, flowers blooming, the river thawing, swallows returning – with the departure and anticipated (or perhaps hoped-for) return of a beloved ('님'). The first stanza marks departure coinciding with natural events, while the second links natural arrival signs with the beloved's coming. The final stanza shifts to the present loneliness, questioning who will share the simple act of watching the moonrise, implying a cherished past shared experience now lost. From a historical perspective, the poem reflects the lyrical expression of personal emotion common in the period. While ostensibly about personal love and loss, the underlying theme of waiting and the contrast between nature's reliable cycles and human separation could potentially be interpreted by historians as subtly reflecting the broader atmosphere of longing or uncertainty during the colonial era. The poem's use of older Korean grammatical forms also provides linguistic data for the 1930s.
