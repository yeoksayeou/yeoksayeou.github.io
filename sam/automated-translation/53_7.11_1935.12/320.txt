Choosing "Hope" and "Solitude"

Yohan Chu Yohan (朱耀翰)

The results are poor. If I must reluctantly recommend something, it would be the two short pieces, "Hope" and "Solitude," by Mr. Yi Tong-sŏn (李東善). I have made some edits.<203>

Hope

Yi Tong-sŏn (李東善)

On the sunny side below the mountain
Gathered together
The thatched roofs
Like a flock of sheep
Longing for their master!

Hope pressed down
By the crushed burden (보)
The roofs quietly say,
"I want to have a lover."

Solitude

Yi Tong-sŏn (李東善)

On this autumn night road
While walking with the moon
A wild chrysanthemum
Had fallen asleep—
Without even covering itself with a blanket.<204>
<203-204>

**Summary**

Chu Yohan, a prominent literary figure, introduces two poems, "Hope" and "Solitude," by a newcomer named Yi Tong-sŏn for the magazine *Samch'ŏlli*. Chu expresses disappointment with the overall quality of submissions but reluctantly recommends Yi's work after making some edits. The poems themselves use simple imagery: "Hope" depicts thatched roofs yearning like sheep for love under hardship, while "Solitude" portrays a lone wild chrysanthemum asleep under the autumn moon. From a historical perspective, the article reflects the colonial literary scene where established figures like Chu Yohan acted as gatekeepers, mentoring (and editing) new writers. The poems' themes of suppressed hope and quiet solitude might subtly reflect the atmosphere of the colonial period, where overt expressions of national feeling were restricted, forcing artists to express yearning and hardship through more personal or metaphorical means.

「希望」과 「孤獨」을 골느고

요한 朱耀翰

成績不良임니다. 억지로 推薦하면 李東善氏作 「希望」 「孤獨」 兩小曲입니다. 若干加筆하엿습니다.<203>

希望

李東善

산밑 양지쪽에
뫃여섯는
초각집웅
주인 그리는
양떼처럼!

짜그라진 보에
눌리인 희망
고요히 집웅들이 말한다.
나는 愛人을 갖고 싶다고.

孤獨

李東善

가을 이 밤길을
달따라 거를제
들국화 한송이
잠들었더라-
이불도 덮지않고.<204>
<203-204>
