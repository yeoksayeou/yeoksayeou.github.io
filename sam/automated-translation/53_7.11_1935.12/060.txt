New Thousand Character Classic (新千字文)
The Five Northwestern Provinces with a Population of 80 Million

The currently discussed 5 Northwestern Provinces refer to Hebei (河北), Shandong (山東), Shanxi (山西), Chahar (察呤爾), and Suiyuan (綏遠). Their total population exceeds 80 million people, and their resources include coal, iron, cotton, soybeans, wheat, and kaoliang (高梁). Among these, the coal reserves are astonishing, ranking second only to the United States (米國), with Shanxi Province alone said to have 1,271 tons.<47>

Investment in Manchuria and Mongolia: 1.5 Billion Yen

As for how much capital Japan has invested in Manchuria and Mongolia (滿蒙), it is said to be approximately 1.5 billion yen, and loans for railways and others are also counted at 300 million yen.<49>

**Summary**

This short news digest from December 1935 highlights two points of contemporary geopolitical interest involving Japan's sphere of influence. First, it describes the five provinces of North China (Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Chahar, Suiyuan), noting their large population (80 million) and significant natural resources, especially Shanxi's vast coal reserves (though the figure cited, 1,271 tons, seems erroneous and likely intended to be much larger, perhaps 1,271 billion tons). Second, it quantifies Japan's substantial economic stake in Manchuria and Mongolia (Manmong), citing 1.5 billion yen in investments and an additional 300 million yen in loans. For historians, this article reflects the intense Japanese focus on resource extraction and economic control in mainland Asia during the mid-1930s, contextualizing Japan's expansionist policies that heavily impacted Korea and the region. The specific mention of resources and investment figures provides data points on the perceived value and strategic importance of these territories to the Japanese empire, as reported to a Korean audience under colonial rule.
