Superior to Dogs and Cats

Yi - Hey, you and your wife fight day and night like dogs and cats.
Pak - That's not quite right. Can dogs or cats throw plates or baskets (바구미)?<170>

**Summary**

This short piece presents a humorous dialogue between two men, Yi and Pak. Yi compares Pak's constant fighting with his wife to the way dogs and cats behave. Pak refutes this, joking that he and his wife are "superior" because, unlike animals, they throw plates and baskets at each other during their fights. This brief anecdote uses humor to depict marital strife. For historians, it offers a glimpse into social commentary and humor of the period, potentially reflecting common perceptions of marriage, gender roles (using the somewhat dated term '녀편네' for wife), and perhaps even normalizing domestic conflict through dark humor.
