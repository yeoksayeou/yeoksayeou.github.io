That Child's Age
						P'ain

Saying this and that,
They are all correct words.

If you look kindly, eighteen;
If you look harshly, twenty-eight.

But still, in my eyes,
Even eighteen seems too much. <293>

**Summary**

This short poem by P'ain reflects on the subjective nature of perceiving someone's age, specifically a girl's. Depending on whether one looks "kindly" or "harshly," she appears either eighteen or twenty-eight. However, the speaker, presumably viewing her with affection, feels even eighteen is too old, suggesting she seems even younger and more innocent in their eyes. From a historical perspective, the poem offers a glimpse into personal sentiment and aesthetic appreciation during the colonial period. Its focus on subjective perception rather than overt political themes is common in literature of the time, and the use of older Korean spellings (올흔, 열여들, 만테나) is of linguistic interest to historians studying language evolution.
