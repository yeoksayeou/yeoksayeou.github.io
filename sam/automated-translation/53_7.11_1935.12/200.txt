人生觀 (View of Life)
						花谷 尹益善 (Hwagok Yun Ik-sŏn)

我來本自無形界 (I originally came from the formless realm)
疑問重重疑問上 (Doubts upon doubts pile upon doubts)
生亦一疑死一疑 (Life is also one doubt, death is one doubt)
生爲何事死何之 (For what purpose is life? Where does death lead?)

天然來此天然去 (Naturally I came here, naturally I depart)
科學精神時代觀 (The scientific spirit, the view of the age)
到底天然又一疑 (In the end, "naturally" is yet another doubt)
生來物質死歸無 (Born from matter, returning to nothingness upon death)

空間物質從何至 (From where do space and matter come?)
頭上徘徊靈妙界 (Above the head wanders the wondrous spiritual realm)
遠莫致之更到頭 (Too distant to reach, yet it comes back to the start)
自然生物必因由 (Natural beings must have a cause and reason)

無常觀 (View of Impermanence)

老成驗得曾經事 (The aged and experienced verify past events)
運去近親皆敵國 (When luck departs, even close relatives become enemy states)
禍福如輪轉幾巡 (Fortune and misfortune turn like a wheel, how many cycles?)
時來逆旅摠恩人 (When the time comes, even strangers in an inn are all benefactors)

世情正反貧無惡 (Worldly affairs reverse; poverty is not inherently evil)
欲識個中眞法界 (If you wish to know the true Dharma realm within this)
天理相違富不仁 (Wealth contrary to heavenly principle lacks benevolence)
佛燈禪坐忘吾身 <133> (Sit in Zen meditation by the Buddha lamp, forgetting the self) <133>

**Summary**

This two-part poem, written in Hanmun (Classical Chinese), presents a philosophical meditation on existence by Hwagok Yun Ik-sŏn. The first part, "View of Life" (人生觀), explores profound existential doubts about the origin and purpose of life and death, questioning both traditional ideas of a "formless realm" and modern concepts like "nature" and "science." The second part, "View of Impermanence" (無常觀), reflects on the fluctuating nature of fortune, human relationships, and worldly affairs, ultimately suggesting that true understanding and peace can be found through Buddhist practice—specifically, Zen meditation leading to the transcendence of self. From a historical perspective, the poem is interesting as it showcases the continued use of Hanmun for intellectual expression by Koreans during the colonial period. It reflects the era's engagement with both traditional Eastern philosophy (Buddhism) and encroaching Western modernity (represented by "scientific spirit"), encapsulating the anxieties and search for meaning among intellectuals facing cultural and societal shifts.
