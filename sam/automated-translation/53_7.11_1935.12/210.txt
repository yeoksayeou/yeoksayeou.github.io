A Journey to the Old Battlefield Pyŏktche-gwan, and Also to Soryŏngwŏn, Tomb of King Sukchong's Royal Noble Consort
						By Ch'oe Pong-ch'ik

One late October day at 7:30 AM, upon reaching the Yŏngch'ŏn tram terminus outside Sŏdaemun Gate in Sŏul, as had already been arranged, some were clad in jumpers and short skirts, carrying backpacks, others in light attire and comfortable shoes, lunch bundles tied to their waists. Among them, Chu Yŏng-hyŏn of Yangjŏng High Common School, despite having one weak arm, appeared in a simple shirt, short skirt, barefoot, with a ruddy face, braving the early morning chill, further inspiring the spirits of our group of nine. We crossed Muak-hyŏn pass between Mount Inwang and Mount Anbong in one breath, passed through inner and outer Hongje-ri and the mountain valley mine of Nokpŏn-hyŏn, the Yangch'ŏl-li plain, the old Kup'abal street, the T'aptong stream bridge, the Samsong-ni tavern street, swept over Suttol-kogae (Yŏsŏk-hyŏn) at once, skirted Manggæk-hyŏn in Ogŭm-ni, and advanced along the single mountain valley road through Pinjŏng and Ŭmdal villages. Reaching the site nestled peacefully on the plain, with the feeling of racing through mountains and fields as if on a train, we covered the 40-*ri* distance in just 3 hours. This was Pyŏktche-gwan, the famous historic site of the battle where, over 330 years ago during the Imjin Invasion, the Japanese and Ming armies clashed in a great whirlwind, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat where fresh blood flowed freely.

Panting like Yi Yŏ-song's defeated soldiers, we arrived belatedly to find Mr. Min, having used his legs like an airplane propeller, stretching them out, using his rucksack as a pillow, nonchalantly lying on the floor of the old Pyŏktche-gwan hall. Some leaned against the railing, others milled about in the main hall. The overgrown grass in the front yard was full of autumn color, and the clear sunlight, approaching noon, was brilliantly warm.

Although it has been traditionally called the Battle of Pyŏktche (碧蹄), in reality, the Pyŏktche-gwan of today was not the actual battlefield. Of course, it was undoubtedly a path trodden<134> by the advancing footsteps of victorious Ming and Japanese soldiers and the retreating hoofbeats of defeated horses, and a place where traces of a part of the campaign, with flying matchlock bullets and flashing spears and swords, remained. Pyŏktche-gwan was originally the site of the old Koyang county seat. In the past, for Chinese envoys traveling back and forth on the northern route, guest houses (舘) were established every 50 or 60 *ri* to accommodate the envoys. Pyŏktche-gwan was renowned as the very last guest house on the route coming from China. The so-called Battle of Pyŏktche-gwan during the Imjin War did not have its main battlefield here, but rather the fierce fighting occurred centering around the Mirŭkwŏn plain and Suttol-kogae (Yŏsŏk-hyŏn), starting from T'aptong, about half a *majjang* from old Kup'abal. However, later generations simply called it the Battle of Pyŏktche-gwan because of the original fame of Pyŏktche-gwan. The Battle of Pyŏktche-gwan Historical Marker, established the year before last through the efforts of the authorities, also stands imposingly like it's piercing the sky, made of granite on the mountain slope behind the Pyŏktche-gwan hall, drawing crowds of visitors exploring the battle site according to the season.

The Pyŏktche-gwan building, which appears ancient like an old county seat, was originally located about one *majjang* to the right of its current position, near the entrance to the Hyeŭm-nyŏng mountain valley in the northwest part of the old Koyang county seat area in Pyŏktche-ri. It served as lodging (客舍) for arriving and departing Chinese envoys and other local officials, and the name plaque reading Pyŏktche-gwan (碧蹄舘) is still attached today. It is said to have been moved to its current location after the Koyang County Office was relocated to outside Sŏdaemun Gate in Kyŏngsŏng (next to the Sŏdaemun Police Station) (the current Koyang County Office is a newly built Western-style building within the Hullyŏnwŏn near Kwanghŭimun Gate).

Regarding the Battle of Pyŏktche-gwan, consulting contemporary records of the Pyŏktche Battle during the Imjin Invasion (壬辰兵火), it was a major fierce battle that clearly established the presence of the 60-year-old veteran general Kobayakawa Takakage (小旱川隆景), who fought in Korea as part of the Japanese 6th Division, and the 26-year-old young officer Tachibana Muneshige (立花宗茂). It was also a battle recorded in history as the final blow that prevented the Ming general Yi Yŏ-song (李如松) from ever aspiring to raise his head again.

Tracing the history of the main battle, it goes like this:
In the 25th year of King Sŏnjo, the 14th ruler of the Yi Dynasty (1592 AD, Bunroku 1), on the 16th day of the 6th month, generals Konishi Yukinaga (小西門長) and Kuroda Nagamasa (黑田長政), leading tens of thousands of troops, captured P'yŏngyang. Consequently, Chosŏn requested aid from the Ch'ojong Emperor (Wanli Emperor, 13th Ming Emperor) of Ming China. Five thousand troops under Cho Sŭng-jo (趙承祖) were dispatched to recapture P'yŏngyang but suffered a major defeat by the Japanese army. Chosŏn then sent the court official Sim Yu-gyŏng (沈維敬) to negotiate with Ming for concrete peace talks. It was decided to first conclude a 50-day truce treaty during which hostilities would cease for the negotiation period. This was because Konishi Yukinaga, having fought numerous battles from Pusan to P'yŏngyang, had not only lost a considerable number of soldiers but also his military provisions had turned to ash in the fires of war, and he knew that fighting would be disadvantageous with the cold autumn and winter seasons approaching.

However, contrary to all expectations, the 50-day period passed without the arrival of the Ming envoy. On the 1st day of the 1st month of the 26th year of King Sŏnjo, the Ming general Yi Yŏ-song, leading Yang Yuan (揚元) and Zha Dashou (査大受) (right flank), Qian Shizhen (錢世禎) alongside himself (center flank), and Zhang Shijue (張世爵) and Zu Chengxun (祖承訓) (left flank), commanded a large army of 46,000 troops, half of whom were cavalry. Passing through Anju Castle, they completely surrounded P'yŏngyang Castle on the 5th and launched a fierce attack. Konishi Yukinaga and others, caught by the strategy, fought back furiously. Bullets rained down,<135> and fire arrows obscured the sun in the fierce battle, but they were outnumbered (衆寡不敵). Eventually, the outer castle was recaptured, and the day grew dark. At that time, the Ming army had famous military strategists like Ch'ik Nam-dang (戚南唐 - likely Qi Jiguang), and their tactics were ingenious. Furthermore, their weaponry, including cannons (火砲) that could bombard distances over 5 *ri*, "sky-shaking thunder" bombs (震天雷), and fire arrows (火箭), was far superior and more effective than the Japanese weapons, which consisted mainly of matchlocks (鳥銃) and spears and swords (鎗刀). Consequently, Yukinaga and others, their spirits shaken, discussed retreat that night and secretly withdrew towards Kyŏngsŏng during the night, treading on the ice of the Taedong River.

When news of the Japanese defeat at P'yŏngyang reached Kyŏngsŏng, Ukita Hideie (宇喜多秀家) consulted with the three commissioners (三奉行) and decided to concentrate all nearby garrisoned troops in Kyŏngsŏng. As troops distributed in various places converged on the capital one after another, only Kobayakawa Takakage, the defender of Kaesŏng, despite the envoy Ankoku-ji Ekei (安國寺惠瓊) arriving to convey the main camp's order, refused, suffering from a cough and unable to stop wheezing, saying, "When I crossed the Genkai Sea (玄海) at the age of 60, I had already resolved to die in battle. I shall let Ming know that Japan has Kobayakawa Takakage." He gladly refused to retreat. One of the three commissioners, Ōtani Yoshitsugu (大谷吉繼), rushed from Kyŏngsŏng and persuaded Takakage that crossing the Imjin River and retreating early before the thaw (解永期) arrived would be advantageous for the future. Takakage finally abandoned Kaesŏng and returned towards Kyŏngsŏng, but ultimately did not enter the city, instead setting up camp under the city wall outside Sŏdaemun Gate. This was Takakage's foresight, concerned that the supply route for provisions would be cut off if Kyŏngsŏng were besieged by the Ming army.

Thus, Yi Yŏ-song entered the abandoned P'yŏngyang Castle without a fight on the 6th day of the 1st month. However, having experienced the tenacity of the Japanese army in the previous battle, he was somewhat discouraged and reluctant to advance readily. Spurred on by King Sŏnjo, who had temporarily taken refuge in Ŭiju, Yi Yŏ-song pursued vigorously and drew near Kyŏngsŏng. Upon receiving scouting reports (斥候) of this success (捷報), the Ming generals looked at each other, hesitating to take the lead. At this moment, Kobayakawa Takakage, stroking his white beard, volunteered to lead the campaign. Entrusting the vanguard to the 26-year-old brave young man Tachibana Muneshige, his second-in-command in the 6th Division, he urged him to show daring, and they immediately marched out to battle. On the 26th day of the 1st month of the 26th year of King Sŏnjo, braving the lingering northern wind (朔風), they charged like arrows. Starting with skirmishes with the Ming scouting party at T'aptong, the fierce battle at Yŏsŏk-hyŏn (Suttol-kogae), crossing Manggæk-hyŏn, and fighting in the paddy fields (畓田) of the Pinjŏng-ni plain, the roar of explosions (爆音) was deafening, fire bullets (火彈) popped like roasting beans, and fire arrows (火矢) whistled through the reeds. From early morning until nearly noon, it was truly, literally, a hand-to-hand combat (肉彈戰).

At that time, Tachibana's unit crushed 2,000 Ming cavalry and infantry at Suttol-kogae and advanced leftward, pushing across Manggæk-hyŏn. To the right flank across Suttol-kogae, Kobayakawa Takakage's unit, along with the Inoue unit (井上隊) and Mōri unit (毛利部隊), raised a clamor, attacking from both flanks (左右狹攻). As a result, the Ming army's advance was halted three times, and they reached a state where the large army fell into an encirclement within the battle lines (井中包圍).

It being the half-thaw period (半解氷期), the Japanese forces, being primarily infantry (步兵部隊), found movement relatively free in the paddy field battle. However, the Ming cavalry floundered in the mire, milling about in confusion, eventually losing formation (隊伍) and leaving behind bloody corpses (血屍). They fled scattered<136> behind Pyŏktche-gwan, some towards Hyeŭm-nyŏng, others towards Tŏkp'a-ryŏng.

In this battle, the Ming army of 40,000 suffered a major defeat at the hands of 19,000 Japanese troops. Their reputation plummeted during the rout. Estimated casualties are 6,000 for the Ming army and around 2,000 for the Japanese army. Thus, the elderly Takakage, together with the young valiant general Tachibana Muneshige and others, sang the most glorious victory song (凱歌) of the land battles during the Imjin War. If it weren't for General Kwŏn P'yo (權標將軍 - likely Kwŏn Yul) at Haengju Mountain Fortress and Naval Commander Yi Ch'ungmugong Sunsin (李忠武公舜臣) in the navy, the grand ambition (雄圖) that crossed the Genkai Sea (玄海灘) might have reached its conclusion then. Yi Yŏ-song's admiration for Kwŏn P'yo, and later, a certain Japanese general's high praise for Yi Ch'ungmugong, rating him higher than England's (英國) Admiral Nelson (넬손提督), are merely astonishing historical materials gathered from the Imjin War campaigns, which is only logical.

Reflecting on the passage of history like this, unable to suppress feelings about the past and present, I shouldered my rucksack again. Three cars, boarded separately, stopped in the wide courtyard of Pyŏktche-gwan. A group of 8 or 9 family members, Japanese from the mainland (內地人), alighted amicably, seemingly on a pilgrimage to the historic site of the victorious general of old. They appeared to reminisce about the old tales, walking cautiously through the main hall of the Pyŏktche-gwan building. Pointing things out (指目) to the boys and girls, telling stories of how Kobayakawa hung up his armor (甲衣) and rested for a night before triumphantly returning to Kyŏngsŏng, they strolled up towards the monument platform. <137>

**Summary**

The article recounts the author, Ch'oe Pong-ch'ik's, journey with friends in late autumn 1935 to Pyŏktche-gwan, north of Seoul. While describing the scenic trip, the author clarifies that Pyŏktche-gwan itself was a historic lodging post, but the famous 1593 battle named after it primarily occurred nearby. The main focus shifts to a detailed historical account of the Battle of Pyŏktche-gwan during the Imjin War, detailing the Ming army's recapture of P'yŏngyang under Yi Yŏ-song, the strategic retreat and positioning of Japanese forces led by Kobayakawa Takakage and Tachibana Muneshige, and the subsequent fierce battle where the outnumbered Japanese forces decisively defeated the Ming army. The author emphasizes the Japanese commanders' prowess but contextualizes their victory by acknowledging that figures like Kwŏn Yul and Admiral Yi Sun-sin were crucial in preventing a complete Japanese conquest. The narrative concludes with the author observing Japanese tourists visiting the battle monument, reflecting on the historical significance of the site. From a colonial history perspective, the article is interesting for several reasons: it was written by a Korean author during the Japanese colonial period (1935) and published in a Korean magazine (Samch'ŏlli), yet it details a Japanese military victory over Ming forces on Korean soil. The mention of a battle monument erected by "the authorities" (likely Japanese colonial authorities) just two years prior, and the observation of Japanese tourists ("内地人" - mainlanders) visiting the site to commemorate figures like Kobayakawa Takakage, highlight the Japanese colonial government's efforts to co-opt and reinterpret Korean historical sites, particularly those related to Japanese military history, for their own nationalistic and imperial narratives. The author's neutral, almost admiring tone when discussing the Japanese commanders' military skill, juxtaposed with acknowledging Korean heroes like Kwŏn Yul and Yi Sun-sin, reflects the complex environment Korean intellectuals navigated under colonial rule.

古戰場碧蹄舘, 아울너 肅宗嬪墓昭寧園紀行
						崔鳳則
10月 下旬 어느 날 朝 7時半, 서울 서대문밖 靈泉電車終點에 니르니 이미 約束이 있었는지라 짬바 短裙에 背囊을 질머진이 輕裝便靴에 점심 보재기를 허리에 찬이 그 中에도 한팔이 否實한 몸으로도 單衫短裙에 赤脚紅顔으로 早朝에 寒氣를 能駕하고 出陳한 養正高普의 朱英鉉君은 우리 一行 9人의 氣力을 더욱이 奮勵시킨다. 人王 鞍峯間의 舞鶴峴을 一息之間에 넘어 內外 弘濟里와 碌磻峴의 산골鑛과 梁鐵里平野며 舊把撥거리와 塔洞川橋며 三松里酒幕거리로 숫돌고개(礪石峴)을 대번에 무쓸어 梧琴里 望客峴을 싸고 돌아 賓亭 陰達兩里를 一路山谷에로 邁進하야 나붓이 平原으로 자리잡은 터를 汽車속에서 山野를 달리는 氣勢로 40里 地點을 겨우 3時間 스피드로 다다르니 여기가 바로 330餘年 前 壬辰兵亂에 日明兩軍이 一大風雲을 이르키어 肉彈苦戰으로 鮮血이 淋漓하였든 戰迹의 名所 碧蹄舘 거기이다.
李如松의 敗戰兵처럼 숨을 헐덕이며 뒤및어 이르니 閔君은 飛行機 푸로페타로 代用하던 行脚을 죽뻗고 릭삭구를 베가하야 碧蹄舘 舊廳舍마루에 넌줏이 누었고 或은 欄杆에 몸을 걸치고 或은 大廳에 서성거리는데 庭前草莽도 秋色이 가득하고 正午를 바라보는 맑은 햇빛은 有爛이도 따거웠다.
碧蹄의 古戰이라고 예부터 傳하거니와 그 實은 今日 碧蹄舘 여기가 戰場이었든 것은 아니다. 勿論 當時 明軍과 日軍의 勝겨온 발자욱과 敗해 다라나든 말발굽이 蹂躙해 돌아간<134> 經路이며 鳥銃의 나는 彈丸과 비끼는 搶劒이 번득이었든 一部 戰役의 자최였든 것은 틀임없다. 碧蹄舘은 元來 高陽舊邑基趾로 옛날 中國使臣去來에 北關行路로 5, 60里 許마다 舘을 두어 使臣들의 旅幕을 計한바 碧蹄舘은 중국으로부터 오는 길便에 맨마즈막 旅舘으로 이름난 것이오 壬辰亂의 碧蹄舘戰 云云하는 것은 그 主力戰地가 여기가 아니라 舊把撥서 반마장박 塔洞을 起點으로하야 彌勒院平野와 숫돌고개(礪石峴)를 中心으로 激戰이 亂交하였던 데이다. 그러나 後人은 元來 碧蹄舘의 이름낫던 것으로 그냥 碧蹄舘戰이라고 햇고 當局의 施設로 再作年에 建設된 碧蹄舘 戰蹟記念碑도 碧蹄舘廳舘後 山麓에 花岡岩으로 衝天할 듯이 凡立되어 戰蹟訪問客들의 節따라 雜多의 盛을 呈하게쯤 되었다.
至今 古邑이 蒼然한 碧蹄舘舍는 現位置에서 한마장 右便으로 碧蹄里 바루예전 高陽舊邑地帶의 西北便 惠陰嶺山谷洞口近處에 鎭座하였든 客舍의 建物로 中國使臣과 그 他地方官들의 가고 오는데 宿泊廳舍(客舍)로 그 名을 碧蹄舘이라 하고 懸板한 것이 至今까지 달려잇다. 그後 高陽郡廳이 京城西大門밖(西大門署右側)으로 옴겨온 (現 高陽郡廳은 光熙門內訓練院에 新築洋舍)뒤로 現 場所에 移建한 것이라 한다.
碧蹄舘役 어쨋던 碧蹄戰의 當時 記錄을 叅考하면 壬辰兵火에 日兵第6番部隊로 朝鮮에 出戰하였든 60老將小旱川隆景과 芳年 26歲의 靑年將校 立花宗茂의 그 存在를 뚜렷이한 一大激戰이요 明將 李如松으로 다시 擧頭를 꿈꾸지 못케한 最後一戰의 史를 記錄케 된 戰役이다.
그 主力戰의 沿革을 따지면 이러하다.
李朝14代 宣祖大王25年(西紀 1592, 文錄元年) 6月 16日 將軍小西門長과 黑田長政等이 數萬의 軍師로 平壤을 陷落함에 및어 朝鮮으로는 救援을 明國初宗帝(明13代)에게 請하며 趙承祖摩下5천軍을 派遣하야 平壤을 回復하려다가 日軍에게 大敗하자 朝臣 沈維敬을 보내여明과 相議하야 俱體的 講和를 하기로 하고 先 그 交涉의 期間에는 서로 兵火를 相交치 않기로 50日間 講和條約을 締結케 되었다. 이는 小西行長이 釜山서부터 平壤까지 轉戰하기에 不小한 兵士를 잃을뿐더러 軍糧이 兵火에 灰盡하고 앞으로 秋冬의 寒節이 가까와 오므로 交戰이 不利함을 알기 까닭이다.
그러나 千萬念外 50日 期間이 넘으되 明使가 不到하던바 宣祖 26年 正月1日 明將 李如松이 揚元과 査大受(右脇), 李如松과 錢世禎(中脇) 張世爵과 祖承訓(右脇) 等을 將領으로 騎兵이 相半한 4만6천의 大軍을 引率하고 安州城을 거처 5日에 平壤城을 完然 包圍하고 猛然攻擊한다. 術略에 빠진 小西行長等은 忿激應戰야 彈丸이 비오둣하고<135> 火箭이 해를 가 우도록 激戰하였으나 衆寡不敵이라 마츰내 外城은 奪還되고 날은 임이 저물었다. 當時 明軍에게는 戚南唐과 같은 有名한 兵學大家가 있어 戰法도 奇妙커니와 5里以上의 距里를 爆擊하는 火砲와 震天雷와 火箭의 兵器는 鳥銃과 鎗刀로만 對抗하는 日兵의 武器에 比하야 훨신 優良銃利하였다. 이에 氣魄을 놀내인 行長 등은 當夜에 퇴각을 凝議하고 한밤중에 대동강 빙판을 밟고 그윽히 京城으로 퇴진하였다.
日軍平壤敗報가 京城에 到着하자 宇喜多秀家는 三奉行等과 相議한 結果 附近陳兵을 모다 京城으로 集中하기로 되어 各處에 分布되었든 軍師가 모다 接踵入京하는中 開城守備 小旱川隆景이만은 安國寺惠瓊이 使節로 와 本陳의 令을 傳함에도 不拘하고 風咳에 걸녀 喘息을 不禁하면서도 「내나이 60에 玄海를 건널적부터 발서 戰死는 覺悟한바다. 明으로하여금 日本의 小旱川隆景이 있음을 알게 하리라」하고 즐겨 退軍치 아니한다. 三奉行의 一將 大谷吉繼가 京城으로부터 달려와서 「解永期가 迫頭하기 前에 臨津江을 건너 일즉이 退軍해 둠이 後日에 有利할 것으로 說服하야 隆景이 마츰내 開城을 抛棄하고 京城으로 돌아오되 終乃 入城치아니하고 西大門外 城疊下에 結陳하였으니 이는 京城이 明軍에게 包圍되면 軍糧運路가 遮斷될가 念慮한 隆景의 明見이다.
이에 李如松은 抛棄夜走한 平壤城을 正月6日 不戰入城하였으나 前日戰驗에서 日軍이 얼마나 强忍함에 저억이 挫氣되어 좀처럼 進軍치 아니하므로 一時 義州에 避行하섯든 宣祖大王의 激勵로 追迹長驅하야 京城에 近迫하였다는 斥候의 捷報에 相顔回顧하며 先頭에 나서기를 서로 躕躇하던 次小早川隆景이 白鬚를 흐날리며 自願出征을 決하고 六番隊의 副將인 26歲의 勇敢한 男兒 立花宗茂로 先陳에 果敢함을 遷하야 곧 出戰케하니 宣祖 26年 正月 26日 朔風의 餘襲을 받으며 火箭같이 몰아 塔洞서 斥候部隊와 交火로 爲始하야 勵石峴激戰과 望客峴넘어 賓亭里平野畓田中에서 爆音이 轟然하고 火彈이 콩복듯하고 火矢가 대를 울리어 早朝로 正午가 기웃하기까지에 그야말로 文字그대로의 肉彈戰이었든 것이다.
그때의 立花隊는 숫돌고개에서 明軍兵馬2千을 무찔으고 左로 前進하며 望客峴넘어로 突行하었고 숫돌고개넘어 右狹으로는 小早川隆景部隊와 井上隊 毛利部隊等이 聲勢를 울니며 左右狹攻하는 바람에 明軍은 3次나 行軍이 中斷하야 井中包圍의 陳中에 大軍이 沒落한 地境에 이르렀다.
半解氷期라 畓中激戰에 步兵部隊인 日軍은 오히려 行動이 自由로 되었으나 明軍兵馬는 수렁에 헤매며 갈팡질팡하야 마츰내 隊伍를 일코 血屍를 뒤로 남기며 碧蹄舘을 뒤로<136> 或은 惠陰嶺으로 或은 德破嶺으로 뿔뿔이 逃亡첬다.
이 戰役에 明軍은 4萬大兵으로 日軍 1만9천에게 大敗하야 逃走行脚에 聲譽가 隨地한바 推定死傷이 明軍이 6천 日軍이 2천假量이라한다. 이로써 老隆景은 靑年勇將立花宗茂等과 가치 壬亂陸戰에 가장 빛있는 凱歌를 불른 것이다. 만일에 幸州山城에 權標將軍과 水師提督에 李忠武公舜臣이 아니낫더면 玄海灘을 건넌 雄圖가 이로써 終局을 報하였으리니 如松이 權標를 嘆服하고 後日 日將某가 李忠武로 英國의 넬손提督以上으로 激讚함은 理當한 壬亂의 兵役에서 採集해내인 놀라운 史料일 따름이다.
이렇든 歷史의 推移함을 따라 昔今의 懷를 不禁하면서 릭삭구를 다시 걸머지는데 分乘한 自働車 3臺가 碧蹄舘廣庭에 머물으며 옛날 凱戰將軍의 遺趾를 巡禮하는 日本內地人의 家族8, 9名의 一行이 和氣있게 나리며 故事를 追慕하는 듯 操心스러운 行步로 碧蹄舘舍大廳을 지나 小早川이 甲衣를 걸고 하로밤 쉬여 京城에 凱旋하였다는 이야기를 少年小女들에게 指目하면서 記念碑臺로 거닐어 오른다. <137>
