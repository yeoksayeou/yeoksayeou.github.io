Songam Ch'ŏsa and Tongnak P'algok, Again Han'gŏ Sip'al Yŏng
						By Yi Sang-in

Regarding Songam Ch'ŏsa (松巖處士), some may know him, while others may not. However, taking one step closer, if we say "Songam Ch'ŏsa Kwŏn Ho-mun (權好文)!", many might respond, "Ah, Kwŏn Song-am, the famous recluse scholar (山林儒者) among T'oegye's disciples!"

Considering that Taesan Yi Sang-jŏng (大山 李象靖) said, "In those days, old master T'oegye (退陶老先生) spoke of him as the image of a recluse scholar...," we can affirm his significant presence in the history of Confucianism as a hidden scholar of the mountains and forests (山林의 隱遯之士).

However, he should not be seen merely as a recluse scholar. If we savor the "Tongnak P'algok" (獨樂八曲) or "Han'gŏ Sip'al Yŏng" (閑居十八詠) appended at the end of the supplement volume of his collected works, his existence would indeed be splendid, beyond the history of Confucianism and within the history of pure Chosŏn literature. Yet, the world does not know this. They only know him as a Confucian recluse scholar and are unaware of where his true thought and genuine reclusive sentiments lie.

Those who wish to know him today, rather than struggling to find the true him by flipping through his entire collected works and biographical sketches (行畧), can understand his life, thought, art, and everything else through these "Tongnak P'algok" or "Han'gŏ Sip'al Yŏng," where he expressed his entire thought intuitively and frankly.

Here, let us briefly introduce them at the end—.

One. Tongnak P'algok (獨樂八曲)

[Translator's Note: The following introductory passage is in classical Chinese.]
The master of the rocks (巖主), inept in planning all matters (謀拙萬事), lacking talent in the six arts (才短六藝), resides physically in the world (寓形世間) but keeps his heart beyond material things (宅心物外). In leisure time from yellow ink [study] (黃墨之暇), when feelings arise (會有), on auspicious occasions (嘉辰之興), or regarding matters worthy of song (可詠之事), he expresses them as songs (發以爲歌), arranges them into melodies (調以爲曲), wields his brush to write them down in sequence (揮毫題次), intending them as musical pieces (擬爲樂府). Although their sound may lack proper measure (雖鳴鳴無節), if listened to observantly (聽以察之則), there is meaning within the words (詞中有意), and within the meaning, there is intent (意中有指), capable of making the listener feel moved and sigh in admiration (可使聞者 感發而興嘆也). At times, when the pine-shadowed moon fills the courtyard (松月滿庭), spring flowers entice people (春花撩人), and good friends arrive opportunely (佳朋適至則), after emptying fragrant cups (酌罷芳樽), they lean together on the rock pavilion (共憑巖軒), sing several verses loudly (高歌若干章), gesturing with hands (手*舞), stamping with feet (足之蹈). The joy of the secluded man (幽人之樂) is sufficient (足矣). The song of examining the hut (考槃之歌), the ballad of carrying firewood (負薪之謠), who knows which is superior, which inferior (不知 孰優孰劣也)? Forgetting worries and achieving *, he delights in his will (忘懷得*, 以樂其志), accepts the poverty of Wŏn Sa (甘原思之貧) and spits upon the salary of Cha Chang (唾子張之祿), lies by the north window like Emperor Hŭi Hwang (臥羲皇之北窓), and sleeps soundly on the high pillow of Hwasŏ (酣華胥之高枕). How can wealth and honor corrupt him (富貴何能淫)? How can power and might seize him (威武不能奪)? Generally, in daily life, the expressions of joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure (喜怒哀樂之發), matters of worry, regret, grief, and joy (憂憾悲歡之事), are all eased herein (一於此寬焉). The washing away of dregs (査滓之滌), the purging of wickedness and filth (邪穢之蕩), occurs without expecting it (不期面然). The ancients said,<291> "Songs often arise from worry and thought" (歌多出於憂思). This too arises from the disquiet in my heart (此亦 發於余心之不平而). Chu Mun-gong (朱文公) said, "Singing what one aspires to nourishes one's nature and emotions" (詠歌其所志 以養性情). How profound are these words (至哉斯言)! The heart's disquiet gives rise to this song; singing it expresses the will and nourishes one's nature (心之不平而有是歌歌之暢志而養其性). Alas, these few verses from the pine window (松窓數般之曲), do they not offer some small supplement to the spirit stirred by windy mornings and moonlit evenings (豈無少補於 風朝月夕之動蕩精神乎)? Therefore, I playfully offer this explanation (余 是以戱有說焉).
— Punctuation added by the author [Yi Sang-in]

X X

In a peaceful reign, the gentleman of the fields and wilds (田野逸氏) (repeat) tills clouds at the mountain foot (耕雲麓), fishes the misty river (釣烟江); there is no work beyond this. Fate (窮通) lies with Heaven (天), so why worry about poverty and lowliness (빈천)? Jade Hall and Golden Horse (玉堂金馬) [high office] are not my wish. Springs and rocks (泉石) are my realm of longevity (壽域), a thatched hut (草屋) is my Spring Terrace (春臺). Here I lie (於斯臥), here I sleep (於斯眠), looking up and down at the universe (俯仰宇宙), observing the flow of myriad things (觀流品物), dwelling leisurely (居居然), vastly (浩浩然). Opening my robe, drinking alone (開襟獨酌), pushing back my cap, gazing long at the scenery (岸幘長哺景) — what could compare to this feeling (긔 엇다 하니있고)?

X X

Inside a three-kan thatched hut, just enough space to kneel (容膝裏), stands proudly one idle man (昻昻一閑人) (repeat). Making companions of the zither and books (琴書를 벗을 삼고), with pines and bamboo for a fence (송죽으로 울을 하니), in elegant vitality (修修생사) and a calm heart (淡淡 襟懷), where would worldly dust arise (진념이 어대나리)? From time to time, when the setting sun evokes transcendent feelings (落照超情), reeds bloom red on the bank (藘花岸紅), and lingering mist carried by the wind makes willows fly (殘烟帶風 楊柳飛거든), leaning a single fishing rod (一竿竹 빗기 않고), forgetting worldly schemes, companion to the gulls (忘機伴 鷗景)— what could compare to this feeling (긔 엇다 하니잇고)?

X X

What does a scholar do (士何事乎)? He esteems his ideals, that is all (尙志而己) (repeat). Seeking fame through exams harms ideals (科名損志), and pursuing profit and success damages virtue (利達害德). Rather*, meeting the sages and worthies within the yellow scrolls [books] (黃卷中聖賢을 뫼압고), nurturing language and spirit day and night (言語精神日夜에 *養하야), if one's self is upright (一身이 正하면), where could one not go (어대라도 못 가리리오)? Looking up and down freely (俯仰恢恢), coming and going peacefully (往來平平), knowing the path to follow (갈 길을 알오), should one not establish one's will (立志를 아니하랴)? Standing like a sheer cliff of ten thousand *rèn* (壁立萬仞), magnanimous and unchanging (磊落不變하야), conversing loftily with the ancients (嘐嘐然 尙友千古景) — what could compare to this feeling (긔 엇다 하니잇고)?

X X

Entering the mountains, fear not going deep enough (入山恐不深); entering the woods, fear not being dense enough (入林恐不密). In a broad and quiet field (寬閑之野), on a lonely shore (寂寞之濱), I decided where to live (卜居를 定하니). In rustic clothes and yellow cap (野服黃冠), fish and birds are my only friends outside (魚鳥 外 버디 없다). After the rain clears on the fragrant outskirts (芳郊애 雨晴하고) and flowers fall from ten thousand trees (萬樹에 花落 後에), leaning on a green藜 staff (靑藜杖뷔집고), leisurely coming and going (閑生往閑來하는) along the ten-li stream head (十里溪頭) — was this the sentiment (뜨든) of Master Tsêng Tien (會點氏) enjoying the wind and rain ceremony by the Yi River (浴沂風雩), or Ch'êng Ming-tao (程明道) wandering beside flowers and following willows (傍花隨柳)? Warm sunlight and breezes blow intermittently (暖日光風이 불꺼니 발거니), endless inspiration arises before me (興萬前하니). My serene heart (悠然胸次)— flowing together up and down with heaven, earth, and all things (與天地萬物 上下同流景) — what could compare to this feeling (긔 엇다 하니잇고)?

X X

My home is among the mugwort and weeds like Fan Li's (范萊蕪의 蓬蒿- 오), my path is through flowers and bamboo like Chiang Yüan-ch'ing's (蔣元卿의 花竹이로다). A floating life of a hundred years, what can be done if it is like this (百年浮生 이러타 엇다하리)? Truly, if one lives in seclusion seeking one's ideals (隱居求志) and goes far away never to return (長往不返하면), then official carriages and caps (軒冕) are mud (泥塗-오), ritual cauldrons and bells (鼎鍾) are dust (塵土시라). Could even a sword blade sharpened a thousand times in frost (千磨霜刃) cut this resolve (이 뜻을 긋챠리랴)? Han Ch'ang-li's (韓昌黎) three petitions (三上書) are petty in my view (내의 뜨데 區區하고); Tu Tzu-mei's (杜子美) *Three Rhapsodies* (三丈賦)— should I practice them in my village (내 동내 行道하랴)? Let it be! They take bribes (彼以酌), I uphold righteousness (我以義). Not desiring others' embroidered clothes (不願人之文繡하야), consigning all worldly affairs to Heaven's decree (世間萬事 都付天命景) — what could compare to this feeling (긔 엇다 하니잇고)?

X X

The sovereign's gate is deep within nine layers (君門深 九重하고), and the grassy marsh [where I live] is separated by ten thousand *li* (草澤隔 萬里하니). How can I convey my ten years of concerns (十載心事를 어이하야 上達하료)? Several volumes of extraordinary policies (數封奇策) have long been drafted (草하얀지 오래거다). To serve the ruler and benefit the people (致君澤民)—is this not my talent and lot (내의 才分 아니런가)? Studying the classics and learning the Way (窮經學道) with determination, should I do this (뜯을 두고 이리하랴)? Better to cultivate oneself hidden in hills and valleys (藏修丘壑), retiring from the world without regret (遯世無悶하야), meeting the friends who seek me out (날조찬 번님네 뵈옵고), together holding inherited texts by the green-latticed mountain window (緣籤山窓의 共把遺經), investigating beginning and end (究終始景) — what could compare to this feeling (긔 엇다 하니잇고)? <292>

X X

One screen, one couch, maxims to the left and right (一屛一榻 左箴右銘) (repeat). The spirit's eye is like lightning (神目如電이라); how could I deceive my heart in a dark room (暗室을 欺心하며)? Heaven's hearing is like thunder (天聽如雷라); how could I utter private words recklessly (私語ㅡㄴ들 妄發하랴)? Let us not forget caution and apprehension (戒愼恐懼) even in hidden moments (隱微間에 잊지마세). Sitting like a corpse, appearing thoughtful (坐如尸儼若思), diligent all day (終日乾乾), cautious in the evening as if in peril (夕惕若하는 뜨든). Respectfully serving the Heavenly Ruler [one's innate moral mind] (尊事天君하고), removing external hindrances (攘除外累하야), making the hundred body parts follow commands (百體從令), the Five Constants unfailing (五常不斁하야), I intended to accomplish the work of governing and bringing peace (治平事業을 다 이루려 하였더니). But it was timing and fate (時也命也인디), ultimately without success (迄無成功), the years were not with me (歲不我與하니). White-haired amidst forests and springs (白首林泉), there is nothing more to do (하올 일이 다시 없다). Alas! South of the mountain, north of the water (山之南 水之北에), concealing my traces (歛藏蹤跡하야), living idly for a hundred years (百年閑老景) — what could compare to this feeling (긔 엇다 하니잇고)?

Two. Han'gŏ Sip'al Yŏng (閑居十八詠 - Eighteen Songs of Leisurely Living)

What I desire in life is only loyalty and filial piety. If these two things are absent, how different are we from beasts? Wishing to do this in my heart, I have strived for ten years.

X X

Calculating thus, fame and achievement came late. Carrying my book-box east and west, as if fearing not to catch up ** time flowed like water * I hurry towards **.

X X

Though I may not achieve it, the forests and springs are fine. The carefree fish and birds are naturally at ease. Soon, forgetting worldly affairs, I wish to follow you.

X X

Playing by the rivers and lakes, did I mean to abandon the sage ruler? Trying to serve the sage ruler goes against my pleasures. Alone I stand at the crossroads, not knowing where to go.

X X

Being virtuous like this, what should this body do? Practicing the Way is difficult, and living in seclusion is also flawed. When will I decide this intention and follow what I enjoy?

X X

Trying and trying, I could not achieve this goal. If this goal is achieved, there is supreme joy. Alas! Who claimed that what was wrong yesterday was right?

X X

Stop, stop, but it is hard to stop this work. ** ** *** Leisurely*** Virtuously, I realize that what I did yesterday has come to pass.

X X

When in office, serve the ruler and benefit the people; when out of office, fish the moon and till the clouds. The wise and discerning gentleman takes pleasure in this. Moreover, wealth and honor are perilous; I will live in poverty and lowliness.

X X

Green mountains overlook a blue stream, and by the stream is a misty village. Does even the white gull know the heart's affairs in this thatched hall? In the quiet night by the bamboo window, with the moon bright, it lies in a single zither.

X X

Seeing success and failure like floating clouds, I have forgotten worldly affairs. My joy in fine mountains and beautiful waters—if apes and cranes are not my friends, who would know it?

X X

The wind is naturally clear, the moon naturally bright. In the bamboo courtyard under the pine shadow, not a speck of dust exists. A single zither, ten thousand scrolls of books, are even more serene and pure.

X X

*The moon pierces the clouds and climbs over the treetops <293> Its full clear light shines into the blue stream. Where is the water-lost seagull that follows me?

X X

As the day darkens, there is nothing else to do. Closing the pine gate, I lie down under the moon. Worldly dust has not the slightest hold on my mind.

X X

On the day moonlight mixes with the stream's sound and enters the empty pavilion, I fix my eyes on the moonlight and my ears on the stream's sound. Listening and watching, my whole being becomes clear and bright.

X X

Chasing after wine and women is not the work of a poet; seeking wealth and honor does not match my intentions. Let it be! I will become a fisherman or shepherd and play on the lonely shore.

X X

There is a Way to acting or hiding; if abandoned, why seek it again? South of the mountain, north of the water, sick and old, who tells me, "Hiding your treasure, you confuse the state," ordering me to come or go? The path trodden by sages and worthies is the same throughout antiquity. Whether hidden or visible, how could the Way differ? Since the one Way does not differ, what does it matter which path I take?

X X

Leaning on the fishing rock, why should I add moss? Disturbed the fish, how can I have the will to fish? The slender moon becomes a silver hook, sunk in the blue stream mountain.

X X

Lying on the riverbank, the meaning of watching the river water is: "What passes is just like this" (逝者如斯); how long can a hundred years be? Ten years of worldly thoughts melt away like ice.

Appendix

The Hangul spelling is kept as collected in the literary works. I thought it would be more meaningful to leave it as is rather than correcting it to modern spelling. Although there are only a few pieces, their content, as he stated, "There is meaning within the words, and within the meaning, there is intent" (詞中有意, 意中有指), truly makes one realize anew that he was a sublime scholar rarely seen, with the reclusive, sylvan charm of one who "highly treads the mountains and forests, concealing his traces" (高蹈山林歛藏踪跡) and Puritan-like lofty thought. However, one can also feel the unfulfilled ambition to serve the ruler and benefit the people (致君澤民) pulsating beneath the surface of the words.

Although he concluded his tumultuous life amidst war and chaos in a corner of Ch'ŏngsŏngsan mountain (靑城山), what must his spirit have been like? However, underestimating him politically when discussing him today cannot but be our mistake. How could the established judgment of previous Confucian scholars, that "Just as Chu Mun-gong (朱文公) had Muyisan (武夷山) when he met misfortune, Kwŏn Song-am (權松岩) had Ch'ŏngsŏngsan (靑城山) when he met misfortune," be mere empty talk!
(From the collected notebook of *Sallim Pyŏlgok* [Songs of the Mountain Forest]) <294>

**Summary**

This article by Yi Sang-in introduces Kwŏn Ho-mun (pen name Songam Ch'ŏsa), a 16th-century Joseon scholar and disciple of T'oegye Yi Hwang, primarily known as a reclusive Confucian scholar (山林儒者). Yi Sang-in argues that Kwŏn's literary works, specifically "Tongnak P'algok" (Eight Songs of Solitary Joy) and "Han'gŏ Sip'al Yŏng" (Eighteen Songs of Leisurely Living), reveal him as a significant figure in Korean literature, expressing profound reclusive sentiments, appreciation for nature, scholarly integrity, and hints of unrealized political aspirations. The article presents excerpts from these works, highlighting their literary merit and philosophical depth, suggesting Kwŏn should be appreciated beyond his role as just a Confucian scholar. For historians, this 1940 article is interesting as it subtly elevates a figure known for integrity and withdrawal from worldly affairs during a period of intense pressure under Japanese colonial rule. Celebrating such a historical figure could implicitly endorse values of scholarly independence and cultural pride, offering a quiet form of cultural resistance or reflection without directly confronting the colonial regime.

松巖處士와 獨樂八曲, 다시 閑居十八詠
						李相寅
松巖處士라 하면 그저 아는 분은 알아도 몰을 분은 몰을 것이다. 그러나 한 거름 더 닥아서서 松巖處士 權好文!하고 보면 “아 그 退溪 門人에 山林儒者로 유명하든 權松巖!”하는 사람은 다수일 것이다.
大山 李象靖은 말하기를 “當日退陶老先生以山林儒者之象稱道云云”하였음을 미루어 보아도 그의 山林의 隱遯之士로서 儒敎史上에 얼마나한 존재라는 것을 수긍할 것이다.
그러나 그를 山林儒者로만 불 것이 아니다. 지금 그의 문집 속집 권말에 부록된 “獨樂八曲”이나 “閑居十八詠”을 음미해 본다면 그는 儒敎史上을 떠나서 순수 朝鮮 문학사상에 있어서 그 존재야 실로 찬란할 것이다. 그러나 세인은 알지 못한다. 그를 다만 유교적 산림처사로만 알고 그의 참된 사상과 참된 은일적 정취가 어디 있는지 몰랐다.
오늘날 그를 알려는 자는 그의 문집 전편과 行畧 등을 들추어 가면서 참된 그를 찾으려고 애쓰기 보담 즉관적이오 솔직히 자기의 사상 전체를 표현해 놓은 이 “獨樂八曲”이나 “閑居十八詠”을 통해서 그의 생애, 사상, 내지 예술, 그 모든 것을 알 수 있을 것이다.
이에 그것을 잠간 끝으로 소개하기로 하자―.

一. 獨樂八曲


巖主, 謀拙萬事, 才短六藝, 寓形世間, 宅心物外, 黃墨之暇, 會有, 嘉辰之興, 可詠之事, 發以爲歌, 調以爲曲, 揮毫題次, 擬爲樂府, 雖鳴鳴無節聽, 以察之則, 詞中有意, 意中有指, 可使聞者, 感發而興嘆也, 有時, 松月滿庭, 春花撩人, 佳朋適至則, 酌罷芳樽, 共憑巖軒, 高歌若干章, 手*舞, 足之蹈, 幽人之樂, 足矣, 考槃之歌, 負薪之謠, 不知, 孰優孰劣也, 忘懷得*, 以樂其志, 甘原思之貧而唾子張之祿, 臥羲皇之北窓, 酣華胥之高枕, 富貴何能淫, 威武不能奪, 凡日用, 喜怒哀樂之發, 憂憾悲歡之事, 一於此寬焉, 査滓之滌, 邪穢之蕩, 不期面然, 古人云,<291> 歌多出於憂思, 此亦, 發於余心之不平而, 朱文公曰, 詠歌其所志, 以養性情, 至哉斯言, 心之不平而有是歌歌之暢志而養其性, 噫, 松窓數般之曲, 豈無少補於, 風朝月夕之動蕩精神乎, 余, 是以戱有說焉.

평생에 원하느니 다만 충효 뿐이로다. 이 두일 말면 금수-나 다르리야 마음에 하고저 하야 十載邊邊하노라.

計校 이러터니 功名이 느저세라. 負笈東西하야 如恐不及하는 ** 세월이 물 흐르듯 하* *이를 가하노라.
X X
비록 몯이러도 林泉이 좋으니라. 無心魚鳥는 自閑閑하였나니 早晩에 世事 잇고 너를 좇으려 하노라.
X X
江湖에 노자하니 聖主를 바리려고. 聖主를 섬기자 하니 所樂에 어긔예라. 혼자 岐路에 서서 갈대 몰라 하노라.
X X
어지게 이러그러 이 몸이 엇지 할고, 行道도 어렵고 隱處도 치아얏다. 언제야 이 뜻 결단하야 從我所樂하려노.
X X
하려 하려하되 이뜻 몯하여라. 이 뜻하면 至樂이 있나니라. 우읍다. 엇그제 아니턴 일을 뉘 올타 하든고.
X X
말리 말리하되 이 일 말기 어렵다. ** ** *** 閑*** 어지게 엇그제 하든 일이 되온 줄 알과라.
X X
出하면 致君澤씨 處하면 釣月耕雲 明哲君子는 이를 사 즐기나니 하믈며 富貴危機-라 貧賤居를 하오리라.
X X
청산이 碧溪臨하고 溪上에 烟村이라. 草堂心事를 白鷗ㅡㄴ들 제 알랴. 竹窓靜夜月明한대 一張琴에 있나니라.
X X
窮達 浮雲같이 보아 世事 이저 두고 好山佳水에 노난 뜻들 猿鶴이 내 벗 아니어든 어늬 분이 아르실고.
X X
바람은 절로 말고 달은 절로 불다. 竹庭松影에 一點塵도 없으니 一張琴 萬軸書 더욱 肅漉하다.

*月이 구름 뚫고 솜끄테 나마올라 <293> 十分淸光이 碧溪 中에 빗겨 거날 어대 있는 물 잃은 갈며기 나를 쫓아 오난다.
X X
날이 저믈거늘 나외야 할 일 없어 松關을 닷고 月下에 누어시니 세상에 띄글 마음이 一毫도 없다.
X X
月色이 溪聲에 섯겨 虛亭에 오는 날 月色을 眼屬하고 溪聲을 耳屬해 드르며 보며 하니 一體 淸明하야라.
X X
酒色 쫓아하니 騷人의 일 아니고 부귀 求차하니 듯디 아니가네. 두어라 漁牧이 되오야 寂寞濱에 놀자.
X X
行藏有道하니 바리면 구테 구하랴. 山之南水之北 병 들고 늘근 나를 뉘라서 懷寶迷邦하니 오라 말라하나뇨. 성현의 가신 길히 만고에 한가지라 隱커나 見커나 道- 엇지 다르리. 一道- 오 다르지 아니커니 아모런들 엇다리.
X X
漁磯에 비개거늘 緣苔로 돋글사마 고기를 헤이고 낙글 뜻을 어이하리. 纖月이 銀鉤-되여 碧溪山에 잠겼다.
X X
江干에 누어서 江水 보는 뜻은 逝者如斯하니 백세ㅡㄴ들 몇 근이료. 십년 전 塵世 一念이 어름 녹듯 한다.

附記

한글 철자는 문집에 수집된 그대로다. 新철자로 곤치는 것 보다가 그대로 두는 것이 뜻 있을 줄 생각한 때문이다. 단 몇 편 안되는 것이지만 그 내용에 있어서 그의 말한 바와 『詞中有意, 意中有指』한 것이야 말로 高蹈山林歛藏踪跡의 隱逸的 山林幽趣와 청교도적 고상한 사상은 드물게 보는 숭고한 학자임을 다시금 깨닫게 된다. 그러나 그 중에 致君澤民의 원대한 포부를 발뵈지 못한 웅지만은 詞表躍動함을 또한 느낄 수 있다.
靑城山 一隅에 喧雜한 生辰兵禍를 귀결에 부쳤으나 그의 기개는 또한 어떠하였을가? 그러나 오늘날 그를 云謂함에 있어서 정치적으로 과소 평가함은 우리들의 失錯이 아일 수 없다. 『朱文公之 不遇有 武夷山, 權松岩之不遇有靑城山』이라는 前代의 유학자들의 정평이 어찌 한같 狂說일가 부냐!
