Assessment of Korean High Officials in the Government-General
						By Pukaksanin
Critique of Messrs. Yi Wŏn-bo, Kim Pyŏng-uk, Yun Sang-hŭi, Kye Kwang-sun, Ch'oe Ha-yŏng, Kim Hŭi-dŏk, and Chang Su-gil

The Samch'ŏlli Company requested an assessment of the Korean administrators within the Government-General. Until a few years ago, the number of Korean administrators in the Government-General was very small, limited to just three: the Social Affairs Section Chief, an administrator in the Foreign Affairs Section, and an administrator in the Agricultural Affairs Section, along with a Central Council interpreter concurrently serving as an administrator. Recently, however, Korean administrators have been appointed to the Gold Production Section, Social Affairs Section, and Finance Section,<72> bringing the current total to seven, with indications that two or three more may be added soon. For Koreans to advance as officials, unlike in the past, they must pass state examinations. Passing the Higher Civil Service Examination is truly the gateway to appointment under the modern civil service system. Among the seven administrators mentioned above, three belong to the so-called special promotion group, while the four younger ones are brilliant talents who passed the administrative course of the Higher Examination with distinction. Naturally, they are modern intellectuals who sequentially completed middle school, high school, and Imperial University, and are promising talents destined for advancement, potentially even to provincial governor or bureau director within the main office. By the way, who was the first Korean to pass the Higher Civil Service Examination? Mr. Yi Ch'ang-gŭn (李昌根), currently Kyŏnggi Province Councilor and concurrently Director of the Industry Department, who graduated from Meiji University (明大) in Taishō 11 (1922), was the first to pass the Higher Examination, inspiring the youth and students of the peninsula and becoming the object of admiration for students aspiring to official careers at the time. Having already been a 3rd-rank high official for five years and advanced to Kyŏnggi Province Councilor, he is expected to become the first qualified Korean provincial governor within the next year or two. Following him was Mr. Chang Yun-sik (張潤植), Director of the Tax Department at the P'yŏngyang Tax Supervisory Bureau, and then Mr. Kim Yŏng-sang (金永祥), Director of the Finance Department of Kyŏngsŏng City. By this year, the number of administrative course passers alone has reached over 60, with about 30 already appointed as high officials active in the Korean bureaucratic world.
The Korean administrators in the Government-General are seven in total: Mr. Yi Wŏn-bo (李源甫), Chief of the Social Education Section; Mr. Kim Pyŏng-uk (金秉旭), concurrently serving in the same section (Central Council Interpreter and concurrently Secretary); Mr. Yun Sang-hŭi (尹相曦) of the Foreign Affairs Bureau's Development Section (拓務課); Mr. Kye Kwang-sun (桂珖淳) of the Gold Production Section; Mr. Ch'oe Ha-yŏng (崔夏永) of the Social Affairs Section; Mr. Kim Hŭi-dŏk (金熙德) of the Agricultural Affairs Section; and Mr. Chang Su-gil (張壽吉) of the Finance Section. Now, starting with Mr. Yi Wŏn-bo, Chief of the Social Education Section, let us briefly introduce the personalities of these seven administrators.

Mr. Yi Wŏn-bo (李源甫) (Chief of the Social Education Section, Government-General)

Born in Tŏkwŏn, South Hamgyŏng Province, he is currently 50 years old. He entered the police service early on and rose through the ranks to become Police Superintendent (警視), serving as Chief of the Criminal Affairs Section of Kyŏnggi Province, Governor (郡守) of Chinwi County in Kyŏnggi Province, and Chief of the Social Affairs Section of Kyŏngsŏng City. In April of Shōwa 10 (1935), he was honorably transferred to the position of Councilor (參與官) of North P'yŏngan Province. In North P'yŏngan, he gained the deep trust of Governor Ōtake Jūrō (大竹十郞) (currently Director of the Internal Affairs Bureau) and has enjoyed his favor ever since. Later, when Mr. Ōtake was promoted to Director of the Internal Affairs Bureau, Mr. Yi was transferred to Director of the Industry Department of South Chŏlla Province in March of Shōwa 12 (1937). He subsequently served as Director of the Internal Affairs Department there before swapping positions with Mr. Kim Tae-u (金大羽) this spring.<73> Mr. Yi is inherently more of a politician type than an administrator type, not bothering with trivial matters and possessing considerable nerve. With his solemn appearance, he has the air of an elder (長者之風), and his magnanimous personality and capacity for tolerance make him seem very much like a politician. He is expected to be promoted to provincial governor before long, and a role like governor, a shepherd of the people (牧民官), would likely suit his talents better than section chief or provincial department director.

Mr. Kim Pyŏng-uk (金秉旭) (Secretary of the Central Council - 中樞院 書記官)

Born in Kyŏngsŏng, he is a vigorous 45-year-old official. He graduated from Kyŏngsŏng High School (京城高普) and its Normal Course (同 師範科), served as a teacher (訓導) at Sunch'ŏn Normal School (順天普通學校), Kyŏngsŏng High School, and Kyŏngsŏng Normal School (京城 師範學校), before transferring to become Inspector and concurrently Clerk (慶北道視學兼屬) of North Kyŏngsang Province. In Shōwa 5 (1930), he was promoted to Governor of Ponghwa County, then served as Governor of Ch'ŏngdo County, and in January of Shōwa 9 (1934), he was promoted to Chief of the Industry Section of North Kyŏngsang Province. In May of Shōwa 11 (1936), following Mr. Kim Tae-u's transfer to Social Affairs Section Chief, he was honorably transferred to the position of Interpreter and concurrently Secretary of the Central Council (中樞院), while also serving concurrently as an administrator in the main office's Social Education Section. He is an extremely modest official, and because he is too honest and straightforward (純直), there is some risk of being overly cautious (小心翼翼). Already a 4th-rank high official, the day he becomes a Councilor is not far off, so he should develop more nerve and hone his skills. The position of Central Council Interpreter is traditionally a stepping stone for advancement in Korean official circles, making it an ideal position for handling affairs while moving between the Central Council and the main office, and also for demonstrating one's abilities.

Mr. Yun Sang-hŭi (尹相曦) (Administrator, Development Section, External Affairs Bureau - 外務部 拓務課 事務官)

Mr. Yun is from Taedong County, South P'yŏngan Province, and is 41 years old. He graduated from P'yŏngyang Agricultural School (平壤 農業學校) and entered the Practical Course (實科) of the Faculty of Agriculture at Hokkaidō Imperial University (北海道 帝大), completing the Elective Course (選科) of the same faculty in Taishō 14 (1925). He was soon employed as a temporary staff member (雇員) at the main office, then appointed as Technician and concurrently Clerk (技手 兼 屬官) in the main office's Agricultural Affairs Section. In October of Shōwa 9 (1934), he became Governor of Mun'gyŏng County, North Kyŏngsang Province, and in June of Shōwa 13 (1938), he was promoted to Chief of the Industry Section of North Kyŏngsang Province. In August of this year [likely 1939, as the article is March 1940], following a reorganization of the External Affairs Bureau, he swapped positions with Mr. Song Yŏn-do (宋燃道). Since his time as Mun'gyŏng Governor, Mr. Yun diligently guided the Rural Promotion Movement (農村振興運動), achieving significant results, which gradually brought his presence to light. Shortly before his promotion to main office administrator, he was also a strong candidate for an administrator position at the Kōain (興亞院 - East Asia Development Board). Considered an outstanding figure among Provincial Councilors (道 理事官), he was recently promoted to Administrator of the External Affairs Bureau's Development Section. As emigration projects to Manchuria (對滿) have been designated as national policy emigration, they will gain even greater<74> importance going forward, so much is expected of Mr. Yun's activities. We hope this fine man will conduct himself with due gravity (好漢自重).

Mr. Kye Kwang-sun (桂珖淳) (Administrator, Gold Production Section, Industrial Bureau - 殖産局 産金課 事務官)

Born in Sŏnch'ŏn, North P'yŏngan Province, he is a young official of 31 who has already advanced to 5th-rank, 7th-grade high official. After attending Sinŭiju High School (新義州 高普) and Matsuyama High School (松山高校), he graduated from the Law Faculty of Tokyo Imperial University (東大) in Shōwa 6 (1931). Appointed as a clerk (屬) in Kangwŏn Province, he passed the Higher Examination the following year. In July of Shōwa 9 (1934), at the young age of 26, he was promoted to Governor of P'yŏnggang County. Subsequently transferred to Governor of P'aju County, after just one month he was reassigned as Police Superintendent (警視) and Chief of the Security Section of South Hamgyŏng Province. Then, in July of Shōwa 12 (1937), he was honorably transferred to become an administrator at the Ministry of Colonial Affairs (拓務省), the first Korean to hold such a post. In November of Shōwa 13 (1938), he returned to Korea (歸鮮) as an administrator in the main office's Gold Production Section, where he is pouring the passion of a young official into executing the national policy for gold production. He is a talent with great future prospects. He is bright-minded and sharp-witted, a gifted official, but it would be even better if he cultivated a more profound and dignified demeanor (重厚한 風格).

Mr. Ch'oe Ha-yŏng (崔夏永) (Administrator, Social Affairs Section, Internal Affairs Bureau - 內務局 社會課 事務官)

Born in Ich'ŏn, Kyŏnggi Province, he is a young official of 32. He attended Himeji Middle School (姬路中學) and Matsue High School (松江高校) in the Mainland (內地 - Japan proper) before graduating from the Law Faculty of Tokyo Imperial University (東大) in Shōwa 7 (1932). Passing the Higher Examination the following year, he was appointed as a clerk (屬) in Tokyo Prefecture (東京府). In October of Shōwa 12 (1937), he was suddenly promoted to administrator in the main office. He is a very modest and talented official, still engaged in theoretical studies, with a promising future. His elder brother, Mr. Chu-yŏng (周永氏), also a graduate of Tohoku Imperial University (東北帝大) and a Higher Examination passer, currently holds the position of Governor of Haenam County, South Chŏlla Province. The day will come when both brothers become key figures in the Korean official world.

Mr. Kim Hŭi-dŏk (金熙德) (Administrator, Agricultural Affairs Section, Agriculture and Forestry Bureau - 農林局 農務課 事務官)

From Hamhŭng, South Hamgyŏng Province, he is 30 years old. After attending Hamhŭng High School (咸興高普) and the Third High School (三高), he graduated from the Law Faculty of Tokyo Imperial University (東大) in Shōwa 9 (1934), having passed the Higher Examination while still a student. After graduation, he served as a clerk (屬) in South Kyŏngsang Province and within the provincial office. In August of Shōwa 12 (1937), he was promoted to Governor of Sŏnnyŏng County. Then, in November of Shōwa 12 (1937) [Note: This seems inconsistent, likely meant Shōwa 13 or later if replacing someone who died Nov 12], following the death of Mr. Kang Wŏn-su (姜元秀), he was promoted to Administrator of the Agricultural Affairs Section as his successor. Being prudent, serious, and gentle in nature (性重厚溫和), he gets along well even within the Agricultural Affairs Section, which has many technicians. Mr. Kim is the son-in-law (女婚) of Mr. Ŏm Ch'ang-hyŏp (嚴昌爕), Director of the Internal Affairs Department of South Hamgyŏng Province.

Mr. Chang Su-gil (張壽吉) (Administrator, Finance Section, Finance Bureau - 財務局 理財課 事務官)<75>

A native of Kyŏngsŏng, he is a young man of 29. After attending Posŏng High School (普成高普) and the Third High School (三高), he graduated from the Law Faculty of Tokyo Imperial University (東大) in Shōwa 11 (1936). He took a two-year leave of absence due to illness during his studies but is a talent who passed the Higher Examination on his fifth attempt, though he has a delicate constitution (蒲柳之質). Mr. Chang's elder brother is a lawyer, and his second elder brother is Mr. Chang Yun-sik (張潤植), Director of the Tax Department at the P'yŏngyang Tax Supervisory Bureau; all are renowned for their sharp intellects. Mr. Chang is also exceptionally brilliant and declined an invitation to become an assistant professor at the Faculty of Law and Literature at Keijō Imperial University (城大 - likely Keijō Imperial University), choosing instead to pursue a career as an administrative official. He currently engages in wide-ranging reading, making him a rare scholar among officials. Furthermore, his handling of administrative tasks is swift and accurate (敏速 正確), earning him high praise from both officials and the public in his role as administrator of the Finance Section, which deals directly with the populace under the current situation (時局下).<71>

**Summary**

This 1940 article from the magazine *Samch'ŏlli* profiles seven high-ranking Korean officials serving as administrators (Samugwan) within the Japanese Government-General of Korea. It details their origins, education (often involving elite Japanese institutions and passing the rigorous Higher Civil Service Examination), career paths through various provincial and central government posts, perceived personalities, and future prospects for promotion, including potentially becoming provincial governors. The article highlights the gradual increase in the number of Koreans reaching these positions, framing it as a path for talented individuals within the colonial system. For historians, the article offers valuable insight into the composition and functioning of the upper echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, showcasing the specific roles occupied by Koreans (often related to social affairs, agriculture, finance, or development projects like Manchurian emigration). It underscores the importance placed on Japanese-style elite education and examinations for advancement, while also providing contemporary, albeit potentially biased, assessments of the character and capabilities of these colonial collaborators or functionaries.

總督府 朝鮮人 高等官評
						北岳山人
李源甫-金秉旭-尹相曦-桂珖淳-崔夏永-金熙德-張壽吉 諸氏評

總督府 내에 있는 朝鮮人 사무관의 인물평을 쓰라는 것이 三千里社의 주문이다. 수년 전까지도 總督府에는 朝鮮人 사무관은 사회과장과 외사과 사무관, 농무과 사무관 단 3명에 中樞院 통역관이 겸임 사무관으로 在勤할 뿐으로 其 수가 매우 적었다. 그런데 근래에는 産金課 社會科 理財課에 朝鮮人 사무관이 임명되어<72> 현재 7명이 있으며 근간 또 2,3명이 증가될 듯하다 朝鮮人도 관리로 출세하려면 옛날과 달라서 국가시험에 합격하여야 된다 문관 고등시험에 합격하는 것은 현대 관리제도 하에 있어서는 실로 등용문이라 하겠다 상기 7명의 사무관 중 3명은 소위 특진조에 속하고 少壯 4명은 고등시험 행정과를 우수한 성적으로 당당하게 합격한 俊秀들 뿐이다. 물론 중학 고등학교 帝大學을 순서로 수업한 近化 지식인으로서 장차 도지사는 물론 본부국장까지 榮進이 약속된 有爲의 인재들이다. 그런데 대체 朝鮮人으로서 최초에 高文시험에 합격한 사람은 누구인가. 大正 11년에 明大를 졸업한 現 京畿道 參與官 겸 산업부장 李昌根씨가 최초로 高文에 합격하여 반도 청년 학도의 기염을 토하였으며 당시 官界를 지망하는 학도의 美望의 的이 되었었다. 氏는 이미 고등관 3등이 된 지 5년, 京畿道 참여관에까지 榮進하였는데 앞으로 1,2년 후에는 朝鮮人 유자격자로서는 처음 지사가 될 것이다 이 다음이 平壤 세무감독국 세무부장 張潤植씨 또 그 다음이 京城府 재무부장 金永祥씨인데 이미 행정과 합격자만 금년까지 60여명에 달하여 30여명이 이미 고등관에 임용되여 朝鮮 官界에서 활동하고 있다
總督府에 있는 朝鮮人 사무관은 사회교육과장 李源甫씨를 비롯하여 同課兼務事官 金秉旭씨(中樞院 통역관 겸 서기관) 外事部 拓務課 尹相曦씨 産金課 桂珖淳씨 사회과 崔夏永씨 농무과 金熙德씨 理財課 張壽吉씨 등 7인이다. 이제 사회교육과장 李源甫씨를 비롯하여 7명의 사무관의 인물을 간단히 소개하여보려 한다

李源甫氏 (總督府 社會敎育課長)

咸南 德源 출생으로 당년 50세이다. 일즉부터 경찰계에 入하여 累進 警視로 京畿道 형사과장, 京畿道 振威 군수, 京城府 사회과장 등을 역임하고 昭和 10년 4월에 平北 참여관에 榮轉하였다 平北서 지사 大竹十郞씨(現 내무국장)의 신임이 후하여 이래 知遇를 바더오는 터인데 其後 大竹씨는 내무국장에 榮轉함에 따라 氏는 昭和 12년 3월에 全南 산업부장에 轉任  其 後 내무부장을 지내고 今春 金大羽씨와 其 자리를 바꾸었다.<73> 氏는 본래 사무가 형이라는 것보다 정치가형으로 小事에 拘泥하지 않고 뱃심도 상당히 좋다. 氏는 용모가 근엄하여 長者之風이 있으며 성격이 호방하여 포용력이 있는 것 등 매우 정치가然하다. 멀지 않어 지사에 榮進하게 될 터인데 氏는 과장이나 도의 부장보다는 지사같은 牧民官이 適材일 것이다.

金秉旭氏 (中樞院 書記官)

京城 출생으로 당년 45세의 장년 관리다. 京城高普와 同 師範科를 졸업하고 順天普通學校 訓導, 京城 高普와 京城 師範學校 훈도로 있다가 慶北道視學兼屬에 전임하였다. 昭和 5년에 奉化 군수로 榮進, 淸道 군수를 經하여 昭和 9년 1월에 慶北 산업과장에 榮進하였다가 同 11년 5월에 金大羽씨가 사회과장에 榮轉하는 뒤를 따라 中樞院 통역관 겸 서기관으로서 榮轉하여 본부 사회교육과 사무관까지 겸무중이다 극히 얌전한 관리로서 너무 純直하기 때문에 小心翼翼하는 폐단이 不無하다 이미 고등관 4등이니 앞으로 참여관 될 날도 멀지 아니하니 좀 더 뱃심이 좋와지며 수완을 연마하여야 할 것이다 中樞院 통역관의 지위는 원래 朝鮮人 관계에서는 출세하는 자리니 中樞院과 본부를 내왕하면서 사무도 보며 수완도 발휘하기에는 최적의 지위이다

尹相曦氏 (外務部 拓務課 事務官)

氏는 平南 大同郡 출신으로 당년 41세이다 平壤 農業學校를 졸업하고 北海道 帝大 농학부 實科에 입학 大正 14年에 同 농학부 選科를 수료하였다 곳 본부 雇員에 채용되었다가 본부 농무과 기수 겸 속관에 임명되었다 昭和 9年 10月에 慶北 聞慶 군수, 同 13年 6月에 慶北 산업과장에 榮轉하였다 금년 8月에 외무부의 기구 개혁에 따라 宋燃道씨와 자리를 바꾸었는데 氏는 聞慶 군수시대부터 農村振興運動을 열심히 지도하여 큰 성과를 收하였다 하여 점차 其 존재가 뚜렸하여졌다. 본부 사무관에 榮轉하기 얼마 전에 興亞院 사무관 후보로도 유력하였으며 道 理事官 중에서도 出色의 인물로 주목되드니 先般 외사부 拓務課 사무관으로 榮轉하였다. 對滿 이민사업도 국책 이민으로 결정되여 금후 더욱<74> 중요성을 띠이게 되었으니 氏의 활동이 기대되는데 好漢自重하기를 바란다.

桂珖淳氏 (殖産局 産金課 事務官)

平北 宣川 출생인데 당년 31세의 청년 관리로 이미 고등관 5등 7급에 進하였다 新義州 高普, 松山高校를 經하여 昭和 6년에 東大 법과를 졸업하고 江原道 屬에 임명, 익년에 高文에 합격하여 昭和 9년 7월에 平康 군수에 榮轉한 때가 겨우 26세이다. 其 後 坡州 군수에 轉하여 1개월만에 咸南 보안과장으로 警視에 전임하였다. 다시 昭和 12년 7월에는 朝鮮人으로서는 처음인 拓務省 사무관에 榮轉하였는데 13년 11월에 본부 産金課 사무관으로 歸鮮하여 産金 國策의 수행에 청년 관리의 熱情을 퍼붓고 있어 장래가 촉망되는 인재이다. 두뇌 명철하고 영리한 성격으로 수재 관리인데 좀더 중후한 풍격을 도치하였으면 더욱 좋을 것이다.

崔夏永氏 (內務局 社會課 事務官)

京畿道 利川 출생으로 당년 32세의 少壯 관리인데 內地姬路中學, 松江高校를 經하여 昭和 7년에 東大 법과를 졸업하였다. 翌年 高文에 합격하여 東京 부속에 임명 昭和 12년 10월에 일약 본부 사무관에 榮進하였다 매우 얌전한 수재 관리로서 아직 이론적 연구도 하고 있어 장래가 유망한데 令兄 周永氏 亦 東北帝大 출신으로 高文에 합격하여 全南 海南 군수의 직에 있는데 형제가 모다 朝鮮 官界에서 중진이 될 날이 있을 것이다

金熙德氏 (農林局 農務課 事務官)

咸南 咸興 출신으로 당년 30세이다. 咸興高普, 三高를 經하여 昭和 9년에 東大 법과를 졸업하였는데 재학중에 高文에 합격하였다. 졸업 후 慶南 부속과 도속을 지내고 昭和 12년 8월에 宣寧 군수로 榮轉되었다가 同 12년 11월에 姜元秀씨가 별세한 후에 其 후임으로 농무과 사무관에 榮轉하였다. 性重厚溫和하니만치 기술자 만흔 농무과에서도 잘 친화하여 지내고 있다. 氏가 咸南 내무부장 嚴昌爕씨의 女婚이다

張壽吉氏 (財務局 理財課 事務官)<75>

京城 출신으로 당년 29세의 청년이다 普成高普와 三高를 經하여 昭和 11년에 東大 법과를 졸업하였다. 도중 병으로 2년이나 휴학을 하였는데 高文은 5번으로 합격한 수재이나 蒲柳의 질이다. 氏는 長兄이 변호사, 次兄이 平壤 세무감독국 세무부장 張*植씨로서 모다 두뇌 명철하기로 유명한데 氏도 비상한 수재로서 城大 법문학부에서 조교수로 초청한 것을 거절하고 행정관으로 출세하려 하고 있다. 현재도 다방면의 독서를 하고 있어 관리로서는 稀有한 학구일 뿐 아니라 사무의 처리도 敏速 正確하여 時局下 민중과 직접 관계가 많은 理財課 사무관으로서 관민간에 호평을 얻고 있다.<71>
<72-75, 71>
