Article in "Pip'an" Magazine Causes Trouble, Editor-in-Chief Song Pong-u Sued

An article titled "The Tae-dong Minuhoe and Minuhoe Reflected in the Mirror of Scrutiny" (檢鏡에 비친 大東民友會와 民友會) in the November issue of the press magazine "Pip'an" (批判) has become problematic, and the magazine's editor-in-chief (主幹), Mr. Song Pong-u (宋奉瑀), was recently sued for "defamation" (명예훼손) by Mr. Yi Kak-chong (李覺鍾), the lifetime advisor (終身顧問) of the Tae-dong Minuhoe (大東民友會).<24>

**Summary**

The editor-in-chief of the magazine "Pip'an," Song Pong-u, has been sued for defamation by Yi Kak-chong, the lifetime advisor of the Tae-dong Minuhoe. The lawsuit stems from an article published in the magazine's November issue that critically examined the Tae-dong Minuhoe. For historians, this brief news item highlights the risks faced by the press in colonial Korea when scrutinizing potentially powerful or pro-Japanese organizations like the Tae-dong Minuhoe. It also points to the use of legal means, such as defamation lawsuits, to potentially suppress critical voices and reveals the activities of figures like Yi Kak-chong associated with such groups.
