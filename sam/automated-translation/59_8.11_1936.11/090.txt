Proclamation of the New Governor-General Minami

The New Governor-General Minami, successor to former Governor-General Ugaki, arrived in Kyŏngsŏng on August 26th and, upon attending the Government-General office for the first time on the following day, the 27th, issued a proclamation, the contents of which are as follows.

Having now humbly received the great mandate (大命) as Governor-General of Chosŏn and upon assuming my duties, I hereby declare my intentions to the officials and people within this territory.

The grand plan (宏謨) for the governance of Chosŏn, following the Imperial Rescript (聖詔) of annexation, has already been largely decided and is immutable. Since the beginning of administration (始政), successive rulers have revered the Imperial Way (皇猷), merely formulating policies (鑄策) for over twenty-five years, and now the administrative results (政果) have been greatly achieved, almost completely transforming the old appearance. However, the current world situation (世界情勢) is perilous, and the circumstances (處遇) of the Empire are also not easy. Internally, it is essential and urgent in these times to greatly cultivate the national spirit (國民精神), strengthen the substance (實質) of the economy, thereby invigorating and nurturing national capability (國民的 能力), and concurrently accomplish the grand design (宏圖) of Japan-Manchuria unity (日滿一體), the foundation (根基) of East Asian peace (東洋和平), and foster the reality of mutual prosperity (同榮) for both nations. Thus, I believe the mission with which Chosŏn is burdened (負荷) has become increasingly great (益大). That is, clearly perceiving (洞觀) the state of oneness (一如) between mainland Japan and Chosŏn and the interdependence (相依) of Chosŏn and Manchuria concerning both human and material elements (人約 物約의 兩 要素), developing resources (資源), enlightening and nurturing (啓沃) the people's hearts (民心), and genuinely enabling them to reach an impeccable (間然없는) standard of living (生活의 基準) as a strong and powerful people (雄强國民)—this generally manifests (顯現) the ultimate ideal (統治終局의 이상) of governance. Therefore, much depends on extraordinary (이상한) effort henceforth. Moreover, the path (途) to conform (則) to this spirit and advance (赴) towards this ideal lies in further deeply recognizing the true nature (本然) of the Imperial Way state (皇道國家), promoting harmony among people (人和), accelerating every opportunity (機運) in culture, industry, and economy (文化產業 經濟), striving for the improvement (向上) of the people's level (民度) and the promotion (增進) of public benefit (公益), thereby aiming for the perfection of both material and spiritual aspects (物心의 兩全).

While naturally aiming for the proper development (適正한 발전) by succeeding the previous course (前緖) of governance and following the precedents (先縱) of implementation (施爲), I shall respond (應處) to the trends of the times (時運), respect the substance (所在) of the people's will (民意), and hope not to fail (愆치 안키를) in fulfilling my mission, taking as the main principle the discarding of vanity and pursuit of substance (去華就實). Let all officials and people within this territory understand (料諒) this and not be sparing (不吝) in their sincerity (誠) of cooperation (協戮) for the sake of the nation (邦家).
Shōwa 11 [1936], August 27th

Clearly Stated Major Outline of Administration

With Governor-General Minami welcoming Vice Governor-General Ōno, the governance of the peninsula finally enters the main stage (本舞臺) of full-scale advance (本格的 躍進) from the first 25-year period of construction. A fresh and new (清新) atmosphere has become prevalent (濃厚) both inside and outside the Government-General, renewing both official circles and the people's hearts (官界民心). The major outline of administration (施政大綱) for the future was clearly indicated (明示) upon the new Governor-General's first attendance at the office on the 27th. The fundamental policy of governance remains unchanged, but the administrative guidelines selected to adapt (順應) to the actual trends (實勢) of the times aim to proceed with action without words (不言實行) and discarding vanity for substance (去華就實). This is based on Chosŏn's mission concerning Japan-Manchuria unity (日滿一體), the foundation (根基) of East Asian peace, as well as the concretization (具體化) of the central government's renewal of all government affairs (庶政一新) and invigoration of official discipline (吏道振作). The clearly stated major outline of administration is:
1. Promotion of Agriculture, Mountain Villages, Fishing Villages & Promotion of Economic Rehabilitation
2. Uplifting of the People's Spirit
3. Improvement and Stabilization of Livelihood
4. Enhancement of National Defense Facilities in a Broad Sense
5. Expansion of Education
6. Resource Development
7. Promotion of Harmony between Mainland Japan and Chosŏn <44>

**Summary**

This article presents the inaugural proclamation (諭告) of Minami Jirō, the new Governor-General of Korea, issued on August 27, 1936. Minami acknowledges the administrative progress made over the past 25 years but emphasizes the perilous world situation and the need for Korea to fulfill its "increasingly great mission" within the Japanese Empire. This mission involves internal strengthening (national spirit cultivation, economic development) and contributing to "Japan-Manchuria unity" (日滿一體) for East Asian peace and mutual prosperity. He outlines his governing principles as following precedents while adapting to the times, respecting the "people's will" (within colonial constraints), and prioritizing substance over ostentation (去華就實). The article concludes by listing the seven key points of his administrative policy (施政大綱), including rural promotion, economic rehabilitation, spiritual uplifting, improved living standards, expanded defense facilities (broadly defined), education expansion, resource development, and fostering harmony (融和) between Japan and Korea.

For historians, this document is significant as it clearly articulates the intensification of Japanese colonial policy in the mid-1930s, aligning Korea more explicitly with Japan's expansionist aims in Manchuria and the broader geopolitical context leading up to the Second Sino-Japanese War. The emphasis on "national spirit" cultivation (國民精神의 도태/계양), "Japan-Manchuria unity," "broad sense national defense," and "harmony" (assimilation) reflects the shift towards total mobilization and heightened assimilation policies (Naiseon Ilchae - 內鮮一體) under Minami's tenure, marking a harsher phase of colonial rule. The seemingly conciliatory mention of respecting "min'ŭi" (民意 - people's will) contrasts sharply with the overarching goal of complete integration into the Japanese Empire.
