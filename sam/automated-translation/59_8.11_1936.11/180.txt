Conversation Room
Sŏ Ch'un and Kyŏnghoeru

"Is Kwanghallu bigger?"
"Is Kyŏnghoeru bigger?"
This question was thrown at Mr. Sŏ Ch'un (徐椿), the chief editor of the Chosŏn Ilbo. The setting was a certain restaurant (料亭) gathering. More than ten distinguished figures (多士) of the capital were present.
"Seoul's Kyŏnghoeru is bigger, how could Namwŏn's Kwanghallu possibly be larger?"
came another attack from the "distinguished figures." The one facing this general assault was none other than Mr. Sŏ Ch'un, who had recently returned from a trip to the Samnam region (Three Southern Provinces), visited the old capital of Ch'unhyang, indulged his poetic sentiments, and was serializing his travelogue, "Record of Kyŏnghoeru (慶會樓記)," in a certain paper. In one part of it, Mr. Sŏ had stated that Kwanghallu (慶寒樓 - Note: Mistake in original text, should be 廣寒樓 for Namwŏn pavilion) was bigger than Kyŏnghoeru. Although no one else in the room had been to Namwŏn, they vehemently objected based on common sense.
Seeing the situation was unfavorable, Mr. Sŏ laughed heartily and then, with logic beyond imagination, persuaded the entire room. The whole room was struck dumb (啞然), and the alcohol they had drunk seemed to wear off instantly.

"Well, if you measure it with a ruler (尺), Kyŏnghoeru is bigger. However! Kyŏnghoeru stands alone amidst artificial mountains and water, while Kwanghallu stands alone on a vast plain. Moreover, the former is man-made, the latter is natural. Could Kyŏngbokkung's lotus pond (蓮塘) possibly compare to Ojakkyo (烏鵲橋)? How then can one say Kyŏnghoeru is bigger than Kwanghallu?"

Kim Chunyŏn's Dance

One day during the Three Hottest Days (三伏), at the Ch'ŏnhyangwŏn Villa pavilion (天香園別莊 旗亭) outside Seoul's East Small Gate (東小門), famous for its beautiful streams and rocks (泉石), several elegant gentlemen (風流客) of the capital gathered and shared drinks: Yi In (李仁), Yi Chongnin (李鍾麟), Wŏn Sehun (元世勳), Kim Hanggyu (金恒圭), Kim Yaksu (金若水), Pak Ch'anhŭi (朴燦熙), Pak Myŏnghwan (朴明煥), Kim Chunyŏn (金俊淵), Sŏ Chŏnghŭi (徐廷禧), Kim Tonghwan (金東煥). Finally, as the moon rose over the East Gate, the entire party was drunk and full (醉且飽). As the drunken excitement grew lively (陶陶), everyone stood up and began dancing and singing with the kisaeng! At that moment, Mr. Kim Chunyŏn, chief editor of the Tonga Ilbo, stepped far away from his friends doing farmer's dances or six-beat rhythms (六字박이), embraced (擁) a beautiful kisaeng, and moved his graceful steps (蓮步) about three steps away, stylishly performing a (dance) [딴스 - dance]. Was this the genius he learned while attending Berlin University (伯林大學) shining through? The whole room applauded and cheered (拍手喝采) this (dance).<114>

Mr. <Han Sangnyong> and Mr. Kim Sŏngsu and Five Thousand Won

After Mr. Kim Sŏngsu (金性洙) finished his studies in Tokyo (東京) and returned, he had deeply planned something and came to Kyŏngsŏng (京城 - Seoul) to prepare for this business, needing 5,000 Won in expenses. So, he went to Hansŏng Bank (漢城銀行), where his father had a deposit of 60,000 Won, seeking to secure this funding (融通). He met with the bank president (頭取) at the time, Mr. Han Sangnyong (韓相龍). However, President Han saw only a pale-faced scholar (白面書生), a mere youth barely past the age of twenty (弱冠), and though he claimed to be the son of a wealthy man from Chŏlla South Province (全南富豪), there was no way to trust him, so Han made excuses (稱託) and refused.
Experiencing this rebuff (逢變), Mr. Kim Sŏngsu was greatly indignant inwardly, lamenting (痛歎) the lack of magnanimous people in the Chosŏn financial world. He detailed this situation in a letter (上書) to his father.
Upon reading it, his stern father (嚴親) became indignant, indignant, greatly indignant! Finally, he rushed up [to Seoul], confronted Mr. Han Sangnyong, scolded (叱責) him, and demanded his entire deposit of 60,000 Won back on the spot, causing a commotion.
Amidst this fierce pressure, Mr. Han Sangnyong turned pale with fright (大驚失色) and apologized profusely (百方으로 陳謝), but his apologies were entirely ignored (都是不聽). Having no choice but to give back all the deposit, he escaped the immediate situation. However, losing not only a major depositor but also an excellent customer over a mere 5,000 Won was a huge loss.
Unable to think of anything else, Mr. Han himself took 5,000 Won in cash and visited Mr. Kim Sŏngsu at a certain boarding house in Kyedong (桂洞). Bowing repeatedly (百拜 千拜), he explained his past mistake over and over (屢屢說明) and promised to accommodate requests for even tens of thousands of Won at a moment's notice (一令下에 應酬) in the future. Having thus obtained Kim's understanding, they were able to do business thereafter and became close. Although Mr. Han was a seasoned veteran (百戰老將) and mutually recognized as the foremost figure in the Chosŏn financial world, it's said that even now on Chongno (鍾路) street, the story is told of how he had to bow down humbly (低頭平身) to the pale-faced scholar Kim Sŏngsu...

Pak Yŏngch'ŏl's Bitter Smile (苦笑)

Mr. Pak Yŏngch'ŏl (朴榮喆), president of the Sangŏp Bank (商銀), accompanied by his wife (令夫人), looking youthful again (更少年) and traveling light (輕裝), sought out green waters and blue mountains (綠水靑山) and lodged (投宿) at a hotel near Pulguksa (佛國寺). The next morning, when preparing to depart, he looked at the bill [勘定書 - Kanjōsho, Japanese for 'bill'] brought by the hotel maid. It read:
Mr. Pak, 1 night, 5 Won
His Mother (慈堂), 1 night, 5 Won
The hotel had mistaken his elderly wife (年老한 令夫人) for his mother (母堂). Mr. Pak looked at his wife's face for a moment and clapped his hands, laughing wryly (拍掌拱笑). However, it wasn't entirely unreasonable. Mr. Pak had married at fifteen, and his bride at the time was over 10 years his senior. Naturally, she was still over 10 years older than him now. Moreover, women age faster (早老) than men. <115>
<114-115>

**Summary**

This article presents four short anecdotes about prominent Korean figures in 1936. The first recounts Chosŏn Ilbo editor Sŏ Ch'un cleverly defending his claim that Kwanghallu felt larger than Kyŏnghoeru due to its natural setting. The second describes Tonga Ilbo editor Kim Chunyŏn impressing guests with a Western dance at a gathering. The third details how a young Kim Sŏngsu secured a loan from Hansŏng Bank president Han Sangnyong only after Han initially refused, prompting Kim's father to threaten withdrawal of his large deposit, forcing Han to apologize profusely. The final story tells of Sangŏp Bank president Pak Yŏngch'ŏl's amusement when a hotel mistakenly billed his significantly older wife as his mother. These vignettes offer glimpses into the social interactions, cultural shifts (Western dance), and power dynamics among the Korean elite—journalists, financiers, and businessmen—during the colonial period. Historians might find the Kim Sŏngsu/Han Sangnyong story particularly interesting for its illustration of the interplay between established financial figures and emerging capitalists, as well as the assertion of influence by provincial wealth within the colonial capital's banking scene. The casual mention of kisaeng and social drinking also sheds light on the leisure activities of this class.

徐椿氏와 慶會樓

「廣寒樓가 크냐」
「慶會樓가 크냐」
이것은 조선일보 主筆 徐椿氏에게 던저진 질문이다. 座席은 어느 料亭 會飮하는 者. 長安의 多士十餘氏.
「서울慶會樓가 크지, 남원 광한루가 클 까닭이 있느냐」
고 또 한참 「多士」로부터 攻擊, 이 總攻擊의 矢面에 선 이는 무를 것 없이 그때 三南 갔다가 春香故都를 차저 詩情을 寄하고 도라와 「慶會樓記」의 기행문을 某紙에 연재하고 있든 徐椿氏. 氏는 그 一文中에 慶寒樓를 慶會樓보다 크다 했다. 비록 滿座人이 南原 갔다온 이는 없섯슬 망정 상식으로 짐작해서 大反對함이라.
形勢非를 본 氏는 呵呵 大笑러니 奇想天外의 논리로 滿座를 說服, 滿座啞然, 그 때문에 먹었든 술이 모다 깨다.

「그야 자(尺)로 재보면 慶會樓가 크지, 然이나 그러나 慶會樓란 者! 人造山水속에 兀立, 慶寒樓는 茫茫平野에 兀立, 더구나 前者는 人造的 , 後者는 自然的. 蓮塘인들 景福宮것이 烏鵲橋를 당할 손가이었지 써 慶會樓가 慶寒樓보다 크다 할손가.

金俊淵氏의 딴스

三伏의 어느 하로 泉石의 美觀으로 일홈놉흔 서울 東小門박 天香園別莊 旗亭에서 李仁, 李鍾麟, 元世勳, 金恒圭, 金若水, 朴燦熙, 朴明煥, 金俊淵, 徐廷禧, 金東煥등 長安 여러 風流客이 모혀, 酒盃를 나누였다. 마츰내 東門에 月出할 지음에 이르자 滿座는 醉且飽하였다. 醉興이 陶陶하여지자 一座는 모다 이러나 妓女들과 함께 춤을 추고, 노래하고! 그럴 때에 동아일보 主筆 金俊淵氏는 농부가나 六字박이 하는 친구들과는 뚝 떠러저 一位美姬를 擁하고 저멀니 3步 박게서 蓮步를 옴겨 멋지게 (딴스)하다. 伯林大學 다닐 때 배운 天才發揮? 滿座는 이 (딴스)에 拍手喝采하다.<114>

<韓相龍>氏와 金性洙氏와 五千圓

金性洙氏가 東京留學을 맛치고 돌아와 장차 무었을 속 깊이 計劃한 바 있어 京城으로 와서 그 事業에 대한 準備運動을 하는데 비용 5千圓이 필요하였다. 그래서 자신이 이 資金의 融通을 어드랴고 氏의 부친이 6萬圓의 預金을 가지고 있는 漢城銀行으로 달여가서 그때 頭取 韓相龍氏를 面接하고 그 融通을 해달낫스나 韓頭取로 말하면 白面書生으로 겨우 弱冠을 지넷거나 말었거나한 일개 청년이 아모리 자칭 全南富豪의 아들이라고 하나 미들길이 없어  稱託을 하며 거절하였다.
이 逢變을 한 金性洙氏 내심 대단히 憤慨하야 朝鮮金融界에 度量人이 없음을 痛歎하는 남어지에 이 事由를 가추어 자기부친에게 上書를 하였였다.
그랫더니 氏의 嚴親은 憤慨 憤慨 大憤慨 맛참내 뚜여올너와 韓相龍氏를 面對하야 叱責하는 一方 자기의 預金 全部 6萬圓을 즉석에서 내라고 야단이 낫다.
이 서슬이 시퍼런 통에 韓相龍씨 大驚失色 百方으로 잘못을 陳謝하였으나 都是不聽 할 수 없이 預金을 모조리 내주고는 그 당장은 모피하였으나 大預金主 뿐 아니라 優秀한 고객을 단돈 5千圓에 이러 버리는 것은 큰 損失.
생각다 못하야 현금 5千圓을 가지고서 韓氏 자신이 桂洞 某下宿屋으로 金性洙氏를 차저가서 百拜 千拜 向日 잘못을  屢屢說明하고 今後는 몃 萬圓이라도 一令下에 應酬하겠다고 양해를 어더 겨우 그 후에는 去來도 하고 親密하게도 되였다고 한다. 百戰老將인 朝鮮金融界에선 一人者라고 自他가 共認하든 韓氏이지만 이 때만은 白面書生 金性洙氏에게 低頭平身하였다고 지금것 鍾路商街에선 話題거리가 된다고...

朴榮喆씨의 苦笑

商銀頭取 朴榮喆씨가 令夫人 同伴하고 更少年하듯, 輕裝으로 綠水靑山 차저 佛國寺 어느 호텔에 投宿, 이튼날 아츰 출발할 적에 여관집 하녀가 가저온 [勘定書]를 본 즉
朴先生 1泊5圓
그 慈堂 1泊5圓
이라고 써섰다. 호텔에서는 年老한 令夫人을 母堂인줄만 알고 이리함이라, 朴氏 부인 얼골을 한참 처다보며 拍掌拱笑하다. 그러나 그도 無理 아닌 것이 朴氏 열 다섰에 결혼했는데 그때의 신부나이 10餘年長, 無論 현재도 10餘年長, 況 여인은 남성보다 더 早老 하여진에랴. <115>
