**Summary**

The Theater Arts Research Association ("Kŭgyŏn") announced the creation of the "Kŭgyŏn Play Award" to discover new playwrights. The article details the rules for the first public competition: unlimited acts (2-3 hour performance time), free theme (but realistic and performable in Korea), a deadline of October 31, 1936, submission details (at T'aehwa Girls' School in Insadong, Seoul), judging by an internal committee, and a prize of a plaque plus 100 Won. The results were to be announced in newspapers by the end of November 1936. For historians, this article documents cultural activity by Koreans during the Japanese colonial period, specifically the establishment of a literary/theatrical prize. The requirement for "realism enabling performance in Chosŏn" might hint at navigating censorship or reflecting the specific social conditions of colonial Korea. The location (T'aehwa Girls' School, associated with the March 1st Movement) and the prize amount also provide context.
