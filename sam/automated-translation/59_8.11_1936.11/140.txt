Namdaemun Station Diary, Memoir of Former Governor-General Saitō
						Former Governor-General Saitō
(This piece, kept secret (秘藏) during his lifetime, was recently published. As a passage from when he was newly appointed as Governor-General of Chōsen, it allows a glimpse into his state of mind at the time, hence it is reprinted here.)

"I have no particular feelings. While planning to spend the rest of my life in Hokkaidō, ending my days as one of the people through farming, it was difficult to refuse (黙止하기가 어려워) Prime Minister Hara's earnest request (懇請), so I came to take up my post in Chōsen.

August 28th - Departed Tokyo. The party consisted of Mr. and Mrs. Mizuno (Note: Rentarō), Secretary Moriya (Note: Eifu), Secretary Satō and his wife, Mrs. Saegusa, Police Affairs Bureau Chief Noguchi, Industrial Bureau Chief Nishimura, and others including attendants, totaling over 20 people. At the time of departure, several hundred relatives and old friends saw us off at Tokyo Station. Not a few acquaintances also saw us off as far as Yokohama and Kōfuzu. Changed trains at Nagoya, arrived at Ise-Yamada around 9 PM, stayed at the Gojōkai Hotel.

August 29th - Paid respects at both shrines (兩宮參拜), special kagura (神樂) was performed. Departed Yamada in the afternoon, arrived in Kyōto at night, stayed at the Sawamura Ryokan. There is information about unrest in Kyŏngsŏng (京城 不穩). Sent Colonel Tōjō and Lieutenant Fukushima ahead to Kyŏngsŏng.

August 30th - Finished paying respects at the Momoyama Imperial Mausoleums (桃山 兩山陵) and arrived in Ōsaka. Stayed at the Ōsaka Hotel. Invited the Ōsaka Prefectural Governor, Chief of Police, and newspaper reporters and held a dinner party. About thirty people attended. Mr. and Mrs. Mizuno departed Ōsaka the same night to proceed ahead for the handover of duties with former Political Affairs Superintendent-General Yamagata at Shimonoseki<76> tomorrow.

August 31st - Departed Ōsaka early morning, there were many seeing us off. Academic Affairs Bureau Chief Shibata (Note: later Chief Cabinet Secretary of the Saitō Cabinet, Zenzaburō) and his family joined the party. Arrived at Shimonoseki at 9 PM... Met former Political Affairs Superintendent-General Yamagata here. Immediately boarded the connecting ferry and headed for Pusan. The party consists of 29 people.

September 1st - Arrived Pusan in the morning. Chief of Staff Ōno, Major General Murata, Lieutenant Fukushima, etc., were there. An envoy from the Yi Royal Palace (李王宮御使), Count Yi Wanyong (李完用伯) with an interpreter, and South Manchuria Railway Director Kubo came from Kyŏngsŏng to Pusan. There were many people welcoming us at the pier. Stayed at the Ōike Ryokan that night.

September 2nd - 7 AM, departed Pusan heading for Kyŏngsŏng. Along the route (沿道) the train traveled, we received grand welcomes and send-offs from officials and civilians everywhere. After 10 hours, arrived at Namdaemun Station. Received a military salute ceremony, ceremonial cannon fire (儀伏禮砲), and welcoming from hundreds of Japanese and Korean officials and civilians inside the station, as well as foreigners.
As the horse carriage was dispatched to head to the official residence, suddenly someone threw a bomb. Immediately, about 20 people were injured. Major General Murata was among them. Fortunately, among our arriving party, there were no injuries, and we were able to safely enter the Waesŏngdae Official Residence (倭城臺官邸).
At the official residence, immediately met with various officials who came to visit. Received condolences (慰問) from an envoy of His Highness King Yi (李王殿下御使). Prince Yi Kang (李堈公) also did the same. In the evening, Count Yi Wanyong visited. For 3 or 4 days, there were many visits from officials and civilians.
From now until September 12th, for 10 days, I was too busy with personal affairs (身邊多忙) and had no time to draft my diary.<77>

**Summary**

This text is a diary entry by Saitō Makoto, recounting his journey from Tokyo to Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul) in late August/early September 1919 to assume the post of Governor-General of Chōsen (Korea). He describes his initial reluctance, the officials accompanying him, stops in Japan, and the official welcome in Pusan and along the railway. The entry culminates with his arrival at Namdaemun Station in Kyŏngsŏng, where a bomb attack occurred just as he was leaving the station, injuring about 20 people in the welcoming party, though Saitō and his immediate group were unharmed. He notes visits from Korean royalty and officials like Yi Wanyong afterward and mentions being too busy to write for the next ten days. For historians, the diary offers a first-hand, albeit brief, account of the immediate aftermath of the March 1st Movement from the perspective of the incoming Japanese governor-general, including the reported "unrest in Kyŏngsŏng," the security precautions taken (sending officers ahead), and the stark reality of resistance manifested in the bombing attack upon his arrival. Saitō's rather detached tone, even when describing the attack, and his mention of Yi Wanyong's visit are also points of interest.
