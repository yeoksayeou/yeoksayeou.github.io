This brief announcement from the Samch'ŏlli Company provides essential contact and banking information: their telephone number (Kwanghwamun 557) and their bank transfer account number (Kyŏngsŏng 2949). It also announces plans to establish branch offices in various regions and invites interested parties to inquire about the internal regulations for setting one up.
