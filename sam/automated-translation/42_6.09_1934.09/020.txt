Author: 滄浪客
Article Type: 시 (Poem)

Are you reading military books (兵書) because the world is in turmoil?
Are you playing with the white seagulls (白鷗) because the world is at peace?
The autumn moon is bright, so I miss the departed one even more.

Though dreams of coming and going happen every year,
How does one dream a dream of not coming and not going?
O stone Buddha of the mountain fortress (山城), please teach me how to dream.

I (妾), ill-fated (薄命), have guarded this lonely railing (欄干) for 10 years already.
I could endure it without the moon, I could endure it without dreams,
But this long autumn night (秋夜長), the deep night is too long, it is my sorrow (恨).<25>

**Summary**

This short poem by "Ch'angnang'gaek" expresses the deep sorrow and longing of a speaker, likely a woman, on a long autumn night. She wonders about the activities of an absent person—whether they are engaged in worldly matters (reading military books) or enjoying peace (playing with seagulls). The speaker feels trapped in her lonely existence, unable even to dream of a reunion or escape, and laments the unbearable length of the night. The poem uses traditional imagery (autumn moon, seagulls, stone Buddha) and archaic language to convey a sense of enduring sadness and resignation, possibly reflecting personal grief within the broader context of the colonial era, though without explicit political reference. Historians might find it interesting as an example of lyrical expression focusing on personal emotion during a politically charged period, perhaps using traditional forms as a subtle refuge or commentary.

秋夜長
						滄浪客
세상이 어지러워 兵書읽고 게시온가
세상이 태평하여 白鷗더부러 노시는가
가을 달 밝사오니 떠나신분 더욱그리워

오섯다 가시는꿈 해마다 잇삽건만
오서도 안가시는꿈 엇더케 꾸옵는가
산성의 돌부처님아 꿈뀌는법 가르키소.

妾은薄命, 외로운 欄干직혀 이미10年
달업서도 참을 것을 , 꿈업서도 참을 것을
秋夜長 깁흔밤이 너무길어 恨이옵네.＜25＞
