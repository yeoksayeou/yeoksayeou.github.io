There are currently two divisions in Chosŏn (Korea). One is the 20th Division in Yongsan, and the other is the 19th Division in Nanam. And as the highest organ overseeing these two divisions, the Chosŏn Army Headquarters is also located in Yongsan.
So, how many Korean officers are currently on active duty under the Chosŏn Army Headquarters and the two Divisions, which constitute the military authorities of Chosŏn? Also, who are they, and where are they from? I have taken up this pen (붓대) to record all these things.<36>

Yongsan 20th Division
Under the 20th Division located in Yongsan, there is the 79th Regiment, and within that 79th Regiment, there are three battalions. Among them, serving as a battalion commander for one battalion, is an Infantry Major named Yi Ŭng-jun.
A battalion generally consists of about a thousand men. Battalion Commander Yi is responsible for educating and training a thousand officers and men every day.
So, what kind of person is Mr. Yi Ŭng-jun? He is one of the top talents among the 26th graduating class of the Tokyo Military Academy in Taishō 3 (1914). His hometown is Sukch'ŏn in P'yŏngan Province, but he came up to Sŏul as a boy and attended Posŏng School as a first-generation student before attending the Military Cadet School (武官學校) for one year through the connection of Mr. Yi Kap. Then, after the disbandment of the army, he transferred to the Tokyo Army Cadet School (東京陸軍幼年學校), finished that school, entered the Military Academy again, graduated with outstanding results, and was commissioned as an officer. He served for some time as an officer in the 3rd Regiment in Azabu (麻布), Tokyo. Just then, the Siberian Intervention occurred with General Ōi (大井大將) as the Commander-in-Chief, and in 1921, he went off to war in the snow-swept Russian territory. At that time, he earned the distinction of Junior Sixth Rank (從6位), Order of Merit 5th Class (勳5等).
Not long after the withdrawal of the Allied forces, the Japanese army also withdrew, and Mr. Yi Ŭng-jun, having returned from Siberia, was assigned to the Yongsan army base. Until several years ago, he served as an Army Infantry Captain and company commander in the 79th Infantry Regiment. Last year, he was promoted to Major and served as a regimental staff officer. Then, this August, he suddenly became a battalion commander, standing in a position leading over a thousand men. His age this year is said to be forty-two or forty-three. A fact that cannot be omitted when writing about Mr. Yi is that he is the son-in-law of the late Mr. Yi Kap, former adjutant to the Minister of War, a graduate of the Japanese Military Academy, and a leading figure of the Sŏbuk Hakhoe (Northwestern Academic Association). It was because of Mr. Yi Kap <37> that he quit attending Posŏng School and transferred to the Korean Military Cadet School (韓國武官學校), after which he went to Tokyo. Thus, during the Siberian campaign, he deliberately stopped by the city of Nikolsk (니코리스크) to pay respects at the grave of Mr. Yi Kap, who rests eternally in the White cemetery, and upon returning, he married Mr. Yi's daughter, Yi Chŏng-hŭi, and is building a peaceful home. Even now, every morning, if you stand near Samgak-chŏng in Yongsan, you can see Battalion Commander Yi emerging dignifiedly from the official residence of the 79th Regiment on a small hill, riding a white horse with a golden saddle (金鞍白馬). Generally, upon reaching the rank of field officer (佐官級), specifically Major (少佐), the army provides one horse, and they ride their beloved horse towards their assigned battalion. Thinking about it this way and that, it took Mr. Yi nearly 15 or 16 years to rise from Second Lieutenant to Major. Promotions for army officers are generally slow; even after graduating from the Military Academy, one must serve as a probationary officer for 3 or 4 months, only then being commissioned as a Second Lieutenant (少尉). To rise from Second Lieutenant to First Lieutenant (中尉), First Lieutenant to Captain (大尉), and Captain to Major (少佐), each step takes 3 years at the fastest, and 4 or 5 years if slow. Because it concerns matters within the strictly disciplined military, unless there are special merits from combat, it is said that progressing from Second Lieutenant to Major normally takes 20 years.
Compared to this standard, Mr. Yi Ŭng-jun's record can be said to be quite outstanding.

The Highest Ranking, Lieutenant Colonel Hong
However, among active-duty officers, there is one officer whose rank is higher than the aforementioned Mr. Yi Ŭng-jun. That person is Mr. Hong Sa-ik, an Infantry Lieutenant Colonel (步兵中佐) and a graduate of the Army War College (陸軍大學) in Tokyo. The Army War College is the nation's highest institution where active-duty officers holding ranks like Second Lieutenant or First Lieutenant enter to study the highest level of military science. While the entrance competition for the Military Academy is extremely fierce, entering the Army War College is also difficult for anyone who is not an exceptional talent. However, Mr. Hong Sa-ik, having graduated from the Military Academy with outstanding results, passed without difficulty and achieved good results upon graduation. Initially, he was attached to the 20th Division Headquarters, then after the Manchurian Incident, he actually galloped across battlefields, and is now with the Kwantung Army Headquarters (關東軍司令部) in Shinkyō (新京 - Xinjing/Changchun). His age is said to have reached over 40. For his service in the Manchurian campaign, Mr. Hong holds the Junior Sixth Rank (從6位), Order of Merit 5th Class (勳5等), and receives a pension accordingly. Currently, the Korean officers on active duty number over 10, but most are of the rank of Captain or Major; he is the only one at the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. Regarding the Military Academy, <38> there is talk that he is also from the 26th class of Taishō 3 (1914), the same class as Major Yi Ŭng-jun. The exact details are unknown.

The Manchurian Incident and Officer Ranks
Furthermore, among those who were Captains and became Infantry Majors during the regular promotions this August, there is Mr. Yu Sŭng-nyŏl. Mr. Yu is currently serving as an officer attached to the 79th Regiment in Yongsan; his hometown is Kongju, South Ch'ungch'ŏng Province. He graduated early from the Military Academy in Tokyo and has served in the Yongsan army base up to his current rank. He also holds the Junior Sixth Rank (從6位), Order of Merit 5th Class (勳5等). Also, in the 80th Regiment, there is an Infantry Major named Mr. Pak Sŭng-hun. The 80th Regiment is located in Taegu, North Kyŏngsang Province, and it is said that even now, if you pass near the Taegu military barracks, you can see this young officer riding a horse with a dignified bearing (風釆禀禀하게). His hometown is in Kyŏnggi Province, and for his merits, he holds the Junior Sixth Rank (從6位), Order of Merit 6th Class (勳6等). He is still an officer attached to the 80th Regiment, so perhaps the day he will be promoted to battalion commander will come before long. Also within the same 80th Regiment in Taegu is Mr. Nam U-hyŏn. This gentleman was also an Army Captain and became a Major in the regular transfers this August. He is said to be from the 27th graduating class of the Military Academy, Taishō 4 (1915). His hometown is in Kyŏnggi Province. He holds the Junior Sixth Rank (從6位), Order of Merit 6th Class (勳6等). And then there is Captain Yun Sang-p'il, who was boasting his large physique in the manner of a great man (偉丈夫風의 그 巨軀를 자랑하다가) as an officer attached to the 28th Cavalry Regiment under the 20th Division in the Yongsan barracks, but when the Manchurian Incident broke out, he went immediately to the Kwantung Army Headquarters staff. "Captain Yun," "Captain Yun"—this gentleman's name is fairly well-known to the public. After the incident, Mr. Yun returned to Chosŏn and, together with individuals like Colonel Kaneko (金子大佐), who is now assigned as some regiment commander, frequently held lectures about the Manchurian Incident at the Sŏul Public Hall. On another occasion, when Major General Kodama (兒玉少將), who was then the Chief of Staff of the Army Headquarters, invited over a hundred prominent figures from the Korean side—from the business world, press, academia, etc.—to the Chosŏn Hotel for a lecture meeting, also concerning the Manchurian Incident, Captain Yun Sang-p'il also attended and gave a speech. <39> Mr. Yun seemed to possess outstanding talent in eloquence (辯舌의 才가 出衆한듯하엿다).
There is a rumor (風說) that he was also promoted to Major in the regular transfers this August, but the exact details are unknown.

Paek Hong-sŏk, Kim Sŏk-wŏn, and Others
Besides these, there are two more individuals in the 20th Division. One is Mr. Paek Hong-sŏk, attached to the 7th Infantry Regiment (步兵第7聯隊) of the 39th Infantry Brigade Headquarters in P'yŏngyang. The other is Mr. Kim Sŏk-wŏn, attached to the 78th Infantry Regiment (步兵78聯隊). Both gentlemen graduated from the 26th class of the Military Academy in Taishō 3 (1914) and were Infantry Captains. There is talk that they also became Majors in the regular transfers this past summer in August, but since I have not yet checked the official gazette, I cannot state this definitively. Mr. Paek Hong-sŏk's hometown is in South P'yŏngan Province, and he also holds the Junior Sixth Rank (從6位), Order of Merit 5th Class (勳5等). Mr. Kim Sŏk-wŏn also holds the Junior Sixth Rank (從6位), Order of Merit 5th Class (勳5等), and it is said his hometown is Sŏul. Thus, one can see that within the various regiments under the 20th Division, there are six Korean officers, all of whom are either Captains or field officers (Majors). Now, let's move on to the 19th Division.

Nanam 19th Division
Major Sin and Others
In the 74th Regiment under the 19th Division located in Nanam, Hamgyŏng North Province, there is Mr. Sin T'ae-yŏng. He was promoted to Infantry Major this summer in August. His hometown is Kyŏngsŏng (Sŏul), and his age might be 42 or 43. He holds the Junior Sixth Rank (從6位), Order of Merit 5th Class (勳5等). He was previously in the Hamhŭng regiment, but there is talk that he has been assigned as the military training officer (配屬將校) at Taegu Middle School and will be appointed to Taegu before long (未久에).
And then, in the 72nd Regiment in Nanam, there is Major An Pyŏng-bŏm. He previously served at the royal court as a military attaché to the Yi Royal Household (李王附武官) before returning to the army. He is also from the 26th class of the Military Academy, Taishō 3 (1914). His hometown is said to be Sŏul.
Furthermore, in the 75th Regiment located in Hoe-nyŏng, Hamgyŏng North Province, right near the border, there is Infantry Captain Chŏng Hun. His hometown is said to be Sŏul. He holds the Junior Sixth Rank (從6位), Order of Merit 5th Class (勳5等). It is said that even now, one can sometimes see his figure (風姿) riding a horse along the banks of the Tuman River (頭滿江畔). These three individuals are all graduates of the 26th class (Taishō 3 - 1914) and the 27th class (Taishō 4 - 1915). Generally, the vast majority of Korean [officers] are from the 26th and 27th classes.<40>

**Summary**

This 1934 article from the magazine *Samch'ŏlli* lists and provides brief biographical details of over a dozen ethnic Korean officers serving in the Japanese Imperial Army, primarily within the two divisions stationed in Korea (the 20th in Yongsan/Seoul and the 19th in Nanam) and the Chosŏn Army Headquarters. It highlights their ranks (mostly Major or Captain, with one Lieutenant Colonel), their Military Academy class (predominantly the 26th and 27th, graduating 1914-1915), hometowns, assignments, decorations (Order of Merit ranks), and mentions participation in events like the Siberian Intervention and the Manchurian Incident. The article details the career path of Major Yi Ŭng-jun and notes the prominence of Lieutenant Colonel Hong Sa-ik as the highest-ranking Korean officer and an Army War College graduate.

For historians, this article is significant as it provides contemporary documentation of Koreans who achieved relatively high ranks within the Japanese military structure during the colonial period. It sheds light on their integration (or assimilation) path, their geographical distribution within the military in Korea and Manchuria, their educational backgrounds (Japanese military academies), and their participation in Japanese military campaigns, offering insights into the complex identities and roles of colonial subjects within the empire's armed forces. The matter-of-fact tone, while listing achievements and promotions, implicitly raises questions about collaboration, opportunity, and the experiences of Koreans serving the colonizing power.

軍部에 잇는朝鮮人士官
第20師團 李應俊少佐, 朴勝熏少佐, 劉升烈少佐, 南宇鉉少佐, 白洪錫少佐, 金錫源少佐,
第19師團 申泰英少佐, 鄭壎大尉, 安秉範少佐
軍司令部 李大永少佐, 金錫源大尉
關東軍司令部 洪思翊中佐, 尹相弼大尉

朝鮮에는 現在 師團이 둘이잇다. 하나는 龍山에 잇는 20師團이요. 다른하나는 羅南에 잇는 19師團이다. 그리고 이두師團을 統轄하는 最高機關으로 朝鮮軍司令部가 역시 龍山에 잇다.
그러면 朝鮮의 軍部인 軍司令部와 兩師團管下에 現在 現役으로잇는 朝鮮사람사관이 몃분이나 되는가? 또 누구 누이며 어듸 出身들인가. 이러한 모든 것을 記錄하여 보려 이 붓대을 잡엇다.＜36＞

龍山 20師團
龍山에 잇는 20師團管下에 第79聯隊가 잇고 그 79聯隊 속에 大隊셋이 잇다. 그중 한 大隊에 大隊長으로 李應俊이란 步兵少佐가 잇다.
1大隊는 大槪 千名이라한다. 李隊長은 날마다 千名의 將卒을 마터 敎育하고 訓練식힌다.
그러면 李應俊氏란 엇던 분인고 大正 3年에 東京 陸軍士官學校을 마친 第26期生 中 秀才의 1人이다. 故鄕는 平安道 肅川인데 少年 때 서울 올너와서 普成學校 第1期生으로 잇다가 李甲氏반연으로 武官學校를 1年 동안 단이엿다. 그러다가 軍隊 解散后에 東京陸軍幼年學校로 轉學하여 그 學校을 마치고 다시 士官學校에 入學하야 優秀한 成績으로 卒業한 뒤 士官에 任命되야 얼마 동안 東京麻布 第3聯隊士官으로잇다가 때마츰 大井大將을 總司令官으로한 西伯利亞出兵이잇서 1921年에 눈 날리는 俄領으로 出戰하엿다. 그때 從6位 勳5等의 勳功을 탓다.
聯合軍의 撤兵後 未久에 日本軍도 撤兵케 되어서 西伯利亞로부터 도라나온 李應俊氏는 龍山軍隊에 被任되야數年前까지 陸軍步兵大尉 步兵 第79聯隊 中隊長으로 잇다가 昨年에 少佐로昇進되야 聯隊附武官으로 잇든 중 금년 8月에 1躍 大隊長이되야 千餘名을 領率하는 地位에 섯다. 나히는 금년에 마흔둘이라든가 셋이라든가 氏를 記할 때 빼어노을 수 업는 사실은 氏는 前陸軍大臣 副官이며 日本士官學校 出身이자 西北學會의 巨頭이든 故李甲氏의 婿郞인 것이다. 李甲氏때문에 ＜37＞ 普成學校다니든 거름을 그만두고 韓國武官學校로 轉校하엿고 그 뒤 東京으로 드러간 것이다. 그래서 西伯利亞 出戰 當時 일부러 「니코리스크」시에 내리어 白人墓地에 길히 잠들어 잇는 李甲氏墓에 參拜하고 도라나와서 그 따님 李正熙氏와 結婚하야 平和한 家庭을 일우고 잇다. 지금도 아츰마다 龍山三角町 附近에 서면 小丘에 잇는 第79聯隊 官舍로부터 매일 아츰 金鞍白馬에 威風堂堂하게 거러나오는 李大隊長을 만날 수 잇스니 大槪 佐官級 卽 少佐만 되면 軍隊에서 馬匹한아식 주어 愛馬을 타고 所屬大隊로 向하는 것이다. 이럭저럭 생각하면 氏가 少尉에 서부터 少佐에 이르기까지 約15,6年 갓까운 세월이 걸니엇다. 軍隊士官의 昇進는 大槪 더듸어서 士官學校을 마치어도 3,4個月은 그냥 見習士官으로 잇서야 하고 그런 뒤 비로소 少尉에 任官된 지 少尉에서 中尉, 中尉에서 大尉, 大尉에서 少佐에까지 올나 가자면 한계단씩 을으는데 빨너서 3年 느지면 4,5年이 걸닌다. 軍律嚴한 軍隊內의 일이라 特別한 戰功等에 依치 안으면 少尉로부터 少佐에 가기까지20年이 걸니는 것이 普通이라고한다.
李應俊氏는 이例에 비취어보면 成績이 매우 優秀한편이라고 할 것이다.

最高級인洪中佐
그러나 現役士官 中 지금 이약기한 李應俊氏보다 階級이 놉흔 士官 한 분이 잇다. 그분은 洪思翊氏라 하야 步兵中佐요 東京잇는 陸軍大學의 出身이다. 육군 대학은 소위, 중위로 잇는 현역사관들이 들어가서 최고의 軍事學을 배우는 國家的 最高學府로 士官學校의 入學競爭도 대단히 甚하지만 陸軍大學에 들어가기도 여간한 秀才아니고는 어렵다. 그런데 洪思翊氏는 士官學校을 優秀한 成績으로 마첫느니만치 無難히 파스되여 卒業할 때에는 조흔 成績을 가젓섯다. 처음은 第20師團 司令部府로잇다가 滿洲事變后 實際로 戰場을 馳驅하엿다가 只今은 關東軍司令部가되어 新京에 잇다. 年齡은 40餘歲에 이르렷다 한다. 滿洲戰役의 功으로 氏는 從6位 勳5等의 勳章이 잇고 그에 따라서 年金도 잇다. 지금 現役에 잇는 朝鮮人 士官은 모다 10餘 名의 多數에 達하지마는 多數는 大尉와 少佐의 級이요 中佐의 級으로는 氏-唯一한 1人이다. 士官學校는＜38＞ 역시 大正 3年의 第26期 卽 李應俊 少佐와 同期라는 말이잇다. 正確한 것은 몰으겟다.

滿洲事變과 士官級
그러고 大尉로 잇다가 今年 8月 定期昇給 때에 步兵少佐로 된 분에 劉升烈氏가 잇다. 氏는現在 龍山잇는 第79聯隊附士官으로 在任하는데 故鄕은 忠南 公州다. 일즉 東京의 士官學校를 마치고 龍山軍隊에 在職하여 今日에 級하엿는데 亦 從6位 勳5等이며 또 第80聯隊에 步兵少佐한 분이잇는대 그는 朴勝熏氏라 80聯隊 所在地는 慶尙北道大邱인바 지금도 大邱軍營 附近으로 지나느라면 말타고 風釆禀禀하게 지나가는 이 靑年士官을 볼 수 잇다고 한다. 故鄕은 京畿道인데 功으로 從6位 勳6等이 잇다. 아직은 80聯隊附士官으로 잇스니 未久에 大隊長으로 昇進할 날이 잇슬넌지 모르며 또가튼 大邱의 第80聯隊속에 南宇鉉이란 분 이잇다. 이분도 陸軍大尉로 잇다가 今年8月의 定期異動에 少佐로 된 분이다. 士官學校는 大正4年인 第27期生이라 한다. 故鄕은 京畿道이다. 從6位 勳6等을 가지고 잇다. 그리고 20師團管下인 騎兵 第28聯隊附士官으로 龍山軍營에서 偉丈夫風의 그 巨軀를 자랑하다가 滿洲事變이 이러나자 곳 關東軍司令部府로 가잇는 이에 尹相弼大尉가 잇다. 「尹大尉」「尹大尉」라 하야 이분의 일홈은 相當히 世間에 알려지엇스니 事變后 氏 다시 朝鮮에 도라와 지금은 어느 것 聯隊長으로가잇는 金子大佐等과 더부러 서울公會堂에서 滿洲事變演說會를 각금 開催하엿고 또한번은 朝鮮人側 有志들 實業界 言論界 學界等 各方面의 人士百餘名을 그때 軍司令部 叅謀長으로 잇든 兒玉少將이 招請하여 노코 朝鮮호텔-에서 亦是 滿洲事變일로 講演會를 할 때 尹相弼 大尉도 出席하여 演說하엿다.＜39＞ 氏는辯舌의 才가 出衆한듯하엿다.
今年8月 定期異動에 亦少佐로 올넛다는 風說이잇스나 正確한 것은 모으겟다.

白洪錫, 金錫源 其他諸氏
20師團에는 이밧게도 또 두분이 잇다. 한분은 平壤잇는 步兵第39旅團司令部의 步兵第7聯隊附 白洪錫氏요. 또 한 분는 步兵78聯隊附의 金錫源氏이다. 두 분이 모다 大正 3年에 第26期 士官學校出로 步兵大尉로 잇다가 亦今夏 8月의 定期異動에 少佐되어 잇다는 말 들니나 官報를 아직 차저 보지 못하엿스니 斷定하여 말할 수는 업다. 白洪錫氏는 平安南道가 故鄕인데 亦 從6位 勳5等이요. 金錫源氏는 亦 從6位 勳5等으로 그 故鄕은 서울이란 말이 잇다. 이리 하야 第20師團 管下의 各聯隊에는 朝鮮人 士官이 그가 모다 大尉級이 아니면 佐官級인 士官 여섯 분이 잇슴을 알 수 잇겟다. 이제는 第19師團으로넘어가자.
