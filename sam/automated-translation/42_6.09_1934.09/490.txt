Let's Play Merrily, Ching Ching!
						Ch'oe Mun-jin

Ch'ŏnsŏktol (千石乭) of the front house!
The sun rises over Yŏnjibong (蓮池峯).
Let's play merrily, ching ching!

Kodorŏng (高道令) of the back house!
Heat water for the fodder pot.
Let's play merrily, ching ching!

The ox, fed till its back splits,
Bellows that it's full.
Let's play merrily, ching ching!

Our ox, fed bean porridge,
Plows the hard ground well.
Let's play merrily, ching ching!

The sown seeds sprout,
Growing well in the drizzling rain.
Let's play merrily, ching ching!

Yin and Yang are well-matched,
This year will be good! <257>
Let's play merrily, ching ching!

In the yellow fields, golden ears of grain
Wave enticingly.
Let's play merrily, ching ching!

Sharpen the tools, farmhand lad!
Autumn is approaching.
Let's play merrily, ching ching!

Stacks of grain piled high to the sky,
Make the wide yard seem small.
Let's play merrily, ching ching!

Finely mill the new rice grain,
Let's make rice cakes in the tenth lunar month!
Let's play merrily, ching ching!

With the rice left after repaying the *kyerang*,
Pay off debts and taxes.
Let's play merrily, ching ching!

With the sweat shed in spring and summer,
We can live comfortably for a whole year.
Let's play merrily, ching ching! <258>
<257-258>

**Summary**

This poem, written in the style of a folk song or farmer's work song, celebrates the agricultural cycle and the hope for a bountiful harvest. It follows the seasons from spring planting ("sown seeds sprout") to the anticipation of autumn harvest ("golden ears of grain wave," "Autumn is approaching") and the eventual enjoyment of the yield ("make rice cakes," "live comfortably for a whole year"). The repeated refrain "쾟이나 칭칭 노-세" (Let's play merrily, ching ching!) emphasizes a communal spirit and joy in labor and its results. For historians, the poem offers a glimpse into rural life and aspirations in 1930s Korea, reflecting both the timeless rhythms of agriculture and the specific economic realities of the time, notably the mention of paying off debts and taxes ("빗갑고 세금물지") even amidst the celebration, hinting at the economic burdens faced by tenant farmers or smallholders during the colonial period. The term *kyerang* (게랑) likely refers to a form of sharecropping payment or rent.
