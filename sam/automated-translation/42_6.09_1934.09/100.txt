Stroll Down Newspaper Street

Is the Tonga Ilbo planning to never appoint a full-time editor-in-chief? It's already been three years since Mr. Yi Kwangsu (李光洙) resigned, and President Song (宋社長) still holds the position concurrently.
Juniors (后輩) of acting editor-in-chief Mr. Sŏl Ŭisik (薛義植), Messrs. Kim Hyŏngwŏn (金炯元), Yi Iksang (李益相), and Ham Sanghun (咸尙勳), have all become bureau chiefs or deputy chiefs; there's a rumor that Mr. Sŏl Ŭisik will become editor-in-chief and Mr. Pak Ch'anhŭi (朴讚熙) the deputy chief, but...

The Maeil Sinbo is also said to be currently preparing to publish morning and evening editions (朝夕刊).

In the old days, extra editions (號外) were only issued for major world events, but nowadays, they put them out for things as trivial as a cat yawning. Thanks to this, the city is quite noisy, and it considerably disturbs the peace (安眼). Extras should be issued prudently to raise the authority of the extra edition.

A single airplane going to the vicinity of Taegu (大邱) and back is treated as more dazzlingly brilliant than the Graf Zeppelin departing on its world tour. What must foreigners think of the state of Korean journalism (쩌-나리즘)?

Regarding the amount of flood relief funds (水害救濟金), the pages of the Maeil [Sinbo], Chosŏn [Ilbo], and Tonga [Ilbo] are engaged in a great melee. Anyway, the Tonga Ilbo, which hasn't lost to anyone since its founding, has had its nose put out of joint (코가 눌니우다). The final victory is still unknown with five minutes left; how will this fight turn out?

Mr. Kuk Kiyŏl (鞠琪烈), former political editor at the Tonga [Ilbo], resigned after 11 years and received a retirement bonus (退職慰勞金) of 2,000 Won.

Among the presidents of the three newspapers, only Mr. Yŏ Unhyŏng (呂運亨) of the Chungang [Ilbo] lacks a telephone. Does this mean no one at the Chungang Ilbo, including those in department head residences (部私宅), has a phone? No, Vice President Ch'oe Sŏnik (崔善益), Editor-in-Chief Kim Tongsong (金東成), and Business Manager Hong Sŏngsik (洪璔植) all have them. One should consider how this looks to foreigners (外人所視). What could be the reason for this?

The Chungang Ilbo is building a large-scale company residence (舍宅) in the Kye-dong area. Is the Tonga [Ilbo] also planning to start construction on its company residence (私宅) soon? <77>

**Summary**

This article provides gossip and news snippets from Seoul's newspaper scene in 1934. It covers personnel issues at the Tonga Ilbo, the Maeil Sinbo's plans for expansion, criticism of the overuse and sensationalism of newspaper extras, a fierce fundraising competition between major papers, a retirement package for a Tonga Ilbo editor, and the peculiar lack of a telephone for the Chungang Ilbo's president despite other executives having one. It also mentions plans for building company residences by Chungang Ilbo and potentially Tonga Ilbo. For historians, the article offers insights into the competitive landscape of colonial Korean journalism, including rivalries (especially in fundraising), management structures, personnel movements, and the financial aspects (retirement bonuses, company housing). The comments on sensationalism and the perception by foreigners also reflect the pressures and practices of media operating under Japanese colonial rule.

新聞街散步
東亞日報는 언제까지나 專任編輯局長을 아니 두려는지, 李光洙氏가 辭免한지 벌서 三年, 아직 宋社長 兼任으로 내려오다.
局長代理 薛義植氏의 后輩인 金炯元, 李益相, 咸尙勳 諸氏가 모다 局長도 되고 次長도 되는 철인데 一說에는 薛義植氏 局長되고 朴讚熙氏 次長되리라하지만은...

每日申報도 朝夕刊 發刊키로 되어 방금 준비중이라 한다.

예전은 號外라 하면 天下大事 以外에는 아니 내더니 요지간은 고양이 하품하는 것까지 낸다. 덕분에 市中이 소란하고 安眼을 妨害함이 如干아니다. 號外를 愼重히 내여 號外의 權威를 올니라.

飛行機 한臺가 大邱附近으로 갓다온 것이 바로 체페린飛行機가 世界一周로 떠난 것보다 더 휘황찬란, 朝鮮의 쩌-나리즘 정도를 外人은 무에라할고.

水害救濟金 만코적기로 每日 朝鮮東亞 兩紙面 大亂鬪 아무튼 創刊以來 누구헌테 저본적업는 東亞日報 코가 눌니우다, 最后의 승리는 五分間 아직 모를 일이라 이 싸홈이 엇더케 듸려는 고.

前東亞의 政治部長 鞠琪烈氏 11年만에 辭任하엿는데 退職慰勞金2,000圓을 밧다.

三新聞社長中 電話업는 이에 惟獨 中央의 呂運亨氏在, 그러면 中央日報에는 部私宅에 모다 電話가 업는가 하면 否라 副社長 崔善益씨에 編輯局長 金東成氏에 營業局長 洪璔植氏에 모다 잇다. 外人所視도 생각할 일, 이 무슨 까닭인고.

中央日報 桂洞一局에다가 大規模의 舍宅을 짓는 중 東亞도 私宅을 未久에 着手하리라든가.＜77＞
