Brief Reviews of Recent Readings
						Yi Ha-yun

Nowadays, I am someone who cannot find my own reason for participating in the literary world (文壇). Not only is there little worth reading, but it is also a fact (事實) that I remain without having encountered works (作品) that arouse the impulse (衝動) to write reviews. <250>

**Summary**

The author, Yi Ha-yun, expresses his current inability to find a reason for his participation in the literary scene. He feels there is little noteworthy reading material, and he hasn't come across any recent works compelling enough to inspire him to write criticism. This brief comment reflects a sense of disillusionment or creative stagnation experienced by the writer. For historians, this passage offers a glimpse into the mood of a Korean intellectual during the colonial period, possibly indicating a perceived lack of stimulating literary production or the dampening effect of the era on creative inspiration.
