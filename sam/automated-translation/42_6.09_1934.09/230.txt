**Summary**

This 1934 *Samch'ŏlli* magazine survey asked five contributors to nominate candidates for a hypothetical female mayor of an ideal city. Each respondent listed their top three choices, featuring prominent women of the era such as Hwang Sindŏk, Pak Indŏk, Hŏ Chŏngsuk, Kim Hwallan, and others. Some respondents provided brief, sometimes humorous or pointed, justifications for their choices, touching on qualifications, personality traits, or even perceived physical limitations. The article offers a glimpse into the public recognition of educated and active women in colonial Korea and contemporary discussions, even hypothetical ones, about female leadership roles. Historians might find this interesting as it reflects the visibility of certain female figures, the nature of reader participation in popular media, and societal attitudes towards women entering public spheres during the Japanese colonial period, all within the context of limited political autonomy for Koreans generally.
