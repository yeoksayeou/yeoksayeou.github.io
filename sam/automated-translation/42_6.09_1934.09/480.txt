不出
						秋夜長

You know so well the smell of rice burning,
But why don't you know my heart is burning?
Oh dear, oh dear, I ache all over.

That sound was just a paulownia leaf falling,
Why must you open the door to look?
Oh dear, oh dear, I ache all over.

You know the river wind is rough,
So why do you look at my disheveled hair?
Oh dear, oh dear, I ache all over.

Mother cries looking at the moon,
Yet gently says she came to look across the water.
Oh dear, oh dear, I ache all over.
(To Sŏnu Il-sŏn-nyang) ＜256＞

**Summary**

This poem, titled "Not Going Out / Staying In," expresses feelings of unrequited love or deep emotional distress through a series of contrasts and observations. The speaker laments that someone close notices trivial things (burning rice, falling leaves) but remains oblivious to the speaker's inner turmoil ("burning heart"). The recurring refrain, "Oh dear, oh dear, I ache all over," emphasizes the physical manifestation of this emotional pain, akin to lovesickness. The final stanza introduces a mother figure whose own sadness is subtly denied, mirroring the theme of hidden or unacknowledged feelings. For historians, the poem offers insight into personal emotional expression, possibly from a female perspective (given the dedication), during the colonial period. Its simple, folk-like structure and language, including the traditional lament "Aigo," reflect cultural modes of conveying sorrow, while the pen name "Autumn Night is Long" enhances the melancholic atmosphere. The dedication personalizes the lament.

밥타는 냄새는 잘 알면서
내가슴 타는 건 왜 모르나
아이고 데이고 몸살이 나네

오동입 떠러저 소리난 걸
문 열고 보실 건 뭐란말요
아이고 데이고 몸살이 나네

강바람 거친 줄 아시면서
푸러진 머리를 왜 보시나
아이고 데이고 몸살이 나네

어머닌 달 보고 우시면서
물 건너 본다고 사살낫소
아이고 데이고 몸살이 나네
