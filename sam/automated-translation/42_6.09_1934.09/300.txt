At Hwasin (和信), over 300 employees are sweating through the midsummer heat, aiming to establish a chain of 1,000 stores. Meanwhile, in Tōkyō, Mitsukoshi (三越) is reportedly planning to establish 40 large chain stores across Japan, even increasing its capital and engaging in significant activity. Furthermore, it's said that the Shirokiya Department Store (白木屋百貨店) in Kyōbashi is also secretly planning to set up 300 chain stores throughout Japan. If this happens, it seems the influence of Mitsukoshi and Shirokiya will naturally extend even to Chosŏn (朝鮮).

The other day, a man named Shimizu, the editor-in-chief of the Tōkyō-published business magazine *Shōgyōkai*, came to Seoul. The association of five department stores—Mitsukoshi, Chōjiya (丁子屋), Hirata (平田), Mitsunakai (三中井), and Hwasin—invited him to the Chosŏn Hotel. When this man took the podium to present his "lofty views," he arrogantly stated that both the world and Tōkyō are currently bustling with chain store management, and that department stores are already outdated things... Hearing this, Hwasin's Pak Hŭngsik (朴興植) and Chu Yohan (朱耀翰), who were seated in the audience, called him over and explained that, in fact, we have already laid out plans for a 1,000-store chain and are proceeding in this manner. He was reportedly surprised and greatly impressed (感***하더라니).

The department store battle is naturally progressing; in Tōkyō, Mitsukoshi has opened a branch inside the European liner *Asama Maru* (淺間丸), Takashimaya has opened one on the *Chichibu Maru* (秩父丸), and Shirokiya has opened one on the *Atsuta Maru* (熱面丸, likely 熱田丸 Atsuta Maru). Soon, the day will come when they open branches even on airplanes. In such a situation, the indifference (半眼) and complacent dreams (太平의 꿈) of the Chosŏn merchants on Chongno (鐘路) are truly a pitiful sight, even just looking from the outside.

Although not widely known by the public, there is someone on the Chongno business scene who holds a "trust control" (트라스트 租鐵). He is Mr. No Ik-hyŏng (盧益亨) of the Chŏnmun Sogwan (專門書舘, Specialty Bookstore). Already, the xx Bookstore (xx書店) and xx Books (xx書籍) are in his hands, the xx Book Grove (xx書林) has also substantively come under his control, and while managing the Tae-dong Printing Company (大東印刷所), he is also said to hold shares (株) in the Christian Changmunsa Printing Company (彰文社印刷所). Thus, one can gauge the extent of his influence (勢力).<184>

**Summary**

This 1934 article discusses the burgeoning trend of chain stores, contrasting the ambitious plans of the Korean-owned Hwasin Department Store (aiming for 1,000 stores) with the large-scale chain expansions of major Japanese department stores like Mitsukoshi and Shirokiya, whose influence is expected to reach Korea. It recounts an anecdote where Hwasin executives corrected a visiting Japanese editor who dismissed department stores as outdated, impressing him with their chain store initiative. The article notes the trend of department stores opening branches on ocean liners and criticizes the perceived passivity ("indifference and complacent dreams") of other Korean merchants on Chongno compared to these dynamic business developments. It also highlights the growing influence of No Ik-hyŏng, who is building a significant trust in the bookstore and printing business on Chongno. For historians, the article offers valuable insights into Korean capitalist enterprise (Hwasin) actively competing and adopting modern business strategies (chain stores) under Japanese colonial rule. It reflects the competitive dynamics between Korean and Japanese businesses, contemporary business trends extending globally (chain stores, outlets on liners), and internal commentary on the state of Korean commerce in Seoul, particularly the contrast between proactive figures like Pak Hŭngsik and No Ik-hyŏng and other merchants perceived as complacent. The mention of specific Japanese stores in Seoul (Chōjiya, Hirata, Mitsunakai) and the activities of figures like No Ik-hyŏng provide concrete details about the commercial landscape of colonial Seoul.
