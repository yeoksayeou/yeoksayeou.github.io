(Recruiting Female Employees)

Having already greeted our 6th anniversary since foundation, our company (本社) is now moving its offices to the 4th floor of the Christian Building (基督삘딩) at 91 Jongno 2-ga (鐘路二丁目 九一). At the same time, we are preparing for a great expansion (大廣張), including the publication of "World Women" (萬國婦人) and "Samch'ŏlli Literature" (三千里文學), which have been pending issues (懸案中). Accordingly, we are recruiting female employees (婦人社員) (reporters 근무 기자 working at the head office) based on the following regulations (左規). We eagerly await (苦待하옵니다) applications from talented women (才媛) who truly wish to set foot (投足) in the journalism world (言論社會).

一. Several Female Reporters (婦人記者)
一. Age: From 18 to under 30 years old
一. Academic Background: Those with a level equivalent to graduation from a Girls' Higher Common School (女子高等普校) and possess literary cultivation (文藝的 敎養).

Those who wish to apply, please mail one essay titled "The Current Issues of Our Women's Society" (우리 女流社會의 當面問題), one diary-like essay (日記 비슷한 隨筆), and one recent photograph (最近 影寫眞). Acceptance or rejection (採否) will be communicated by letter at a later date (后日).

**Summary**

This article is an announcement from the magazine *Samch'ŏlli* in September 1934 regarding their recruitment of female reporters. Celebrating its sixth anniversary and relocating to Jongno 2-ga, the company plans to launch two new publications, "World Women" and "Samch'ŏlli Literature," necessitating staff expansion. The notice calls for several female reporters aged 18-30 with at least a girls' high school education and literary knowledge, requiring applicants to submit two essays and a photograph. This piece is interesting historically as it shows a prominent Korean magazine actively seeking educated female employees for journalistic roles during the colonial period, indicating evolving opportunities for women in professional fields, particularly media. It also reflects the magazine's expansion plans and engagement with contemporary social issues ("The Current Issues of Our Women's Society").
