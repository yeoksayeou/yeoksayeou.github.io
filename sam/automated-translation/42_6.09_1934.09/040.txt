三千里春秋
						滄浪客

Although 3 million compatriots weep due to flood damage, there is still no sympathy from the humanitarian Rockefeller Foundation (록폘라財團) of America, nor from Canada, the missions in the Americas (米洲), or the general gentlemen and ladies of the United States (米國).

Also, the great men of Nanjing (南京) and Shanghai (上海) in China remain silent with no news. It shouldn't be this way, but it is a time for overseas figures like Chang Tŏksu (張德秀) and Kim Kyusik (金奎植) to exert themselves.

Rumors circulate that many provincial governors, such as Kim Sŏgyu (金瑞圭) and Mr. Namgung (南宮氏), will bravely retire. While we don't cling to those leaving nor refuse those coming, the ratio of Korean provincial governors, which has barely been maintained at 8 to 5, must not be reduced. Just one word for the sake of the hundreds of county chiefs and thousands of junior officials (判任官) who remain.

The citizens of Kyŏngju (慶州) are reportedly holding a Silla (新羅) Festival. For us, this commemorative event may not be entirely pleasant, but the peak of traditional beauty is also not something to refuse. Let us please make this day a bright festival of songs and dances praising the thousand-year culture of Silla's golden age.
In the old capital P'yŏngyang (古都平壤), a Koguryŏ (高句麗) Festival; in Puyŏ (扶餘), a Paekche (百濟) Festival; and thus in Sŏul (서울), a "Samch'ŏlli" (三千里) Festival - wouldn't this be a beautiful thing? Nostalgia (懷古) is also a kind of strength, a kind of beauty.

The Osaka Mainichi (大阪每日) is serializing poetry and prose by new writers. This is a good thing, but among them are many "writings that insult Chosŏn (朝鮮)". Moreover, it lists people who lack the character and literary talent one would expect even in a dream from a "new writer." Faces flush red; the selection is certainly careless (杜撰).

Early autumn has arrived. The world is likely to see many affairs. Chang Tŏksu (張德秀), Pak Tongwan (朴東完), and other gentlemen residing abroad (留外諸士), return! Return and speak, speak and act!

High gold price, high rice price, high autumn sky - these are the 3 highs that make the poor weep.
There isn't a single Korean secretary in the Government-General (總督府) Press Corps. This isn't an appointment system but a mutual voting election system; why are the reporters from the private vernacular newspapers (民間諺文新聞記者) so powerless? Being a secretary would mean having the right to speak first, yet having not even one out of three is cause for serious reflection (猛省). Are you gentlemen high-minded (眼高) or clean-handed (手淸)? This is no good. As the saying goes, "If not in the position, do not plan its administration (不在其位 不謀其政)"; get the position first, get the position first...

There are organizations that, under the beautiful banner of grand causes (大義名分) like "Flood Relief," "Literacy Campaign," "Stock Company Establishment," etc., dare to do things that make one frown. Be careful! Above all, be gentlemen! Become gentlemanly business organizations!

Recently, on the second anniversary of the death of the late Sŏhae (曙海), a literary pioneer, the literary world came together to erect a memorial stone. The Tonga Ilbo (東亞日報) donated 20 wŏn (圓), the Chungang Ilbo (中央日報) 10 wŏn, and the Maeil Sinbo (每日申報) 20 wŏn. Only the Chosŏn Ilbo (朝鮮日報) gave just 3 wŏn. Looking at their stinginess, it's certainly a 500-year plan! <35>

**Summary**

This "Samch'ŏlli Annals" column by "Ch'angnang Kaek" offers commentary on various issues in Korea during September 1934. The author laments the lack of international aid for Korean flood victims, discusses potential changes in provincial governorships (expressing concern over maintaining the Korean-to-Japanese ratio), comments on the revival of historical festivals (Silla, Koguryŏ, Paekche), criticizes the poor quality and potentially insulting nature of Korean writers featured in a Japanese newspaper, notes the economic hardship caused by high prices, deplores the lack of Korean representation in the Government-General press corps despite it being an elected position, warns against organizations exploiting good causes, and points out the meager donation by the Chosŏn Ilbo for a fellow writer's memorial compared to other newspapers. From a historical perspective, the article offers valuable insights into Korean sentiments regarding international indifference, colonial administrative structures (the governor ratio), cultural nationalism expressed through historical festivals, critiques of Japanese media portrayals, the economic struggles of the populace, and the internal politics and powerlessness felt within the Korean press and intellectual circles under Japanese rule.

三千里春秋
						滄浪客
水災로 300萬同胞 啼泣하건만, 人類博愛主義의 亞米利加 록폘라財團이나 캐나타, 米洲의 宣敎會나 米國一般 紳士淑女, 아직 同情 無.

又 南京, 上海의 中國大人, 잠잠無消息, 이럴수업스련만, 張德秀, 金奎植等 海外諸氏 發奮之秋.

金瑞圭, 南宮氏等, 多數知事勇退하리란 說이 流傳, 去人不招來人不辭이나, 다만 겨우維持되어오든 8對5란 朝鮮人道知事 比率만은減하지말일. 묵어나는 數百郡守, 數千 判任官을 爲하야 고 一言.

慶州市民, 新羅祭擧行云. 우리로는 追憶하는此擧 愉快한 일이 못될지나 傳統美의 高潮 또한 不辭할 일 請컨대 이날은 新羅盛大의 千年文化를 讚揚하는 노래와 춤의 明節로삼소,
古都平壤서는 高句麗祭, 扶餘서는 百濟祭, 그래서 서울서는「三千里」祭 이어이 아름다운일아닐손가. 懷古도 一種의 힘인저, 美인저.
大阪每日, 新人 詩文 連載. 조흔 일이나 個中에는「朝鮮을 辱보이는글」 多又 新人이라고 꿈에도 못할 人格업고 文才업는 이를 羅列. 얼골 확근확근, 確實히 選擇에 杜選.
新秋-立. 天下 將多事. 張德秀. 朴東完等 留外諸士 歸하라, 歸하야 語하랴, 語하야 發하라.

金價高, 米價高, 秋天高-是貧民을 울니는3高
總督府記者團에 朝鮮人幹事 1人도無. 이것은 任命制아니고 彼此投票選擧制인데 民間諺文新聞記者 엇재 이리 無力한고. 幹事라면 우선 發言權잇슬터인데 3人中 1人도업다함은 猛省할일. 諸子는 眼高한가手淸한가 못쓴다. 不在其位면 不謀其政이라고 자리부터 어더노코 자리부터 어더노코...

曰 水害救濟 曰 文字普及 曰 株式會社成立 云云하야 大義名分의 美名下에 얼굴 찡그릴 일 敢行하는 團體가잇다. 注意하라 무엇보다 紳士다워라! 紳士的 事業機關되되라.

지난번 文學的 先驅者 故 曙海2週忌에 文壇人總出로 紀念碑를 하여 세우는데 東亞日報에서 20圓 中央日報에서 10圓 每日申報에서 20圓義損  唯獨 朝鮮日報만3圓을 出, 돈 마지는 것보면 確實히 5百年計劃! ＜35＞
