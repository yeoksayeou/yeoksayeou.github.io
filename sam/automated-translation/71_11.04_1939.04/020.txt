The Tomb of the 72 Martyrs of Huanghuagang, Seeking His Tomb in Guangdong
						Hwanghangnuin

To find the tomb of the 72 martyrs famous in history from the Xinhai Revolution, I set out with Dr. Kim, who was heading to Paris. Stepping onto the wide New Long Road (新長路) on the eastern outskirts of Guangdong, the evening sun had already begun to slant. Truly, Guangdong is called a city of forests, and indeed, along both sides of this New Long Road, towering giant trees stood in rows. The road was also a smoothly paved asphalt thoroughfare, and even amidst the bustle of cultural construction, one could understand the intention of the government authorities who, prioritizing the reverence for the spirits of the patriots (志士), had acted first.

After going some distance, a large stone gate (石門) came into view, upon which was prominently hung a gilded plaque written by Sun Wen (孫文):
"浩氣長存" (The Noble Spirit Endures Forever)

From there, ascending stone steps like a concrete rainbow bridge (虹橋) and passing through the tiered levels, a large stone monument (石碑), seemingly about 20 ch'ŏk tall, stood before my eyes. Carved deeply into it were the seven characters we had been searching for:
"七十二烈士之墓" (Tomb of the Seventy-Two Martyrs)

In front of it, placed perhaps by some thoughtful descendants, were bundles of incense wood and roses, abundantly laid out just as one might see before the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Paris or Washington. In one corner, a single wisp of incense smoke could be seen quietly rising.

This monument commemorates the events of March 29th of the Xinhai year (the year just before the first year of the Republic, so 28 years ago from now). Under the leadership of Sun Wen and others, young revolutionary soldiers, full of high ideals and spirited vigor, attempted to occupy Guangdong but <24> were counterattacked by the old warlord forces, failed to achieve their great ambition, and were instead captured and all executed by firing squad. Afterward, through the efforts of their comrades, the bodies of 72 deceased were gathered. Through the hands of Hu Hanmin (胡漢民), Chen Jiongming (陳炯明), and others, this monument was erected for their sacrificed comrades. However, I heard that initially, only 56 names were identified, and the rest were unknown, but they were all interred together. Later, in the 8th year of the Republic (1919), the names of the remaining 16 were also discovered, allowing all 72 martyred souls, now spared anonymity, to be properly buried. Now, this monument, bathed in the evening sun, what does it seek to tell? My feelings were deeply moved and melancholic. Let's transcribe the inscription on the monument.

Tomb of the Seventy-Two Martyrs of Huanghuagang

Selected by Zou Lu (鄒魯) of Dapu (大埔)
Written by Hu Yi (胡毅) of Panyu (番禹)
In the Guangzhou uprising of March 29th, Xinhai year, the number of party members who died in the affair cannot be ascertained. Afterward, Mr. Pan Dawei (潘達微) collected the bodies of 72 party members and buried them together at Huanghuagang (黃花岡). Hence arose the name "Seventy-Two Martyrs of Huanghuagang." Mr. Pan was also a party member; because he was not yet named in arrest warrants, he resolutely came forward to collect the bones of his deceased friends amidst the dangerous and unstable times, which can be called difficult indeed. The following year became the first year of the Republic of China. Mr. Hu Hanmin (胡漢民) and Mr. Chen Jiongming (陳炯明) successively served as Governor-General of Guangdong, discussing the repair and decoration of the mass burial site. The Provincial Assembly approved funding of 100,000 yuan. In the second year (1913), chaos erupted, and it was not carried out. In the autumn of the seventh year (1918), Army Division Commander Mr. Fang Shengtao (方聲濤) first raised funds to repair the old tomb, establishing a rough scale. Assembly Speaker Mr. Lin Sen (林森) further raised funds to build a monument pavilion and a memorial archway (紀功坊), ensuring it would not be lost to posterity. However, attempting to engrave the names and native places of all those who died that day onto the monument proved extremely difficult. This was because the undertaking required utmost secrecy; unless one was already acquainted, one could not know the names and native places of fellow participants, nor did they wish to know. Therefore, even today, those participants who did not die can only name those they already knew. Not only did more than seventy-two people die in the affair, but even for these seventy-two, we cannot fully list their names and native places. Is this not lamentable? Lu (魯 - Zou Lu) and Mr. Zhu Dafu (朱大符) are both participants who did not die. Together, they collected facts, obtaining the names and native places of the deceased. Mr. Lin Sen further confirmed these with other surviving participants present, Mr. Hu Yi (胡毅), He Kefu (何克夫), Wu Yongshan (吳永珊), Xu Weiyang (徐維揚), etc., establishing fifty-six names. Among them, three still lack native places. These were first engraved on the monument, leaving blank spaces to allow for additions should further information become known. It is titled "Monument of the Seventy-Two Martyrs of Huanghuagang" because seventy-two bodies were indeed buried. Although there are omissions today, we hope to be able to supplement and complete it in the future. To die wrapped in horsehide (馬革裏尸 - i.e., die in battle) was the aspiration of the party members; being buried was not their expectation, let alone leaving a name. What we do today is merely to provide material for later generations to linger and pay tribute; it has no bearing on the deceased themselves. Alas! Those lost in this campaign were not just the elite of our party, but indeed the finest talents of the entire nation consumed in one blaze. The material sacrifice cannot be considered anything but great. However, the spirit it aroused made the world clearly understand the party members' aspirations, integrity, and conduct, and the fact that the revolution could not be stopped. Thus, within less than a year, the Republic of China was successfully established. Is its significance not then profound? Yet, contemplating the endless national difficulties and the ease with which worthy talents are lost, taking up the pen to write this record, I cannot overcome the feeling of being a survivor.
December 18th, 8th Year of the Republic of China (1919)

"Later, the discovery of sixteen more names was recorded on a separate monument."
Eight years after the seventy-two martyrs were buried at Huanghuagang, Lin Sen (林森) of Minhou (閩候) and others repaired their tomb. Again, on March 29th, the survivors inquired after the names and home villages of the martyrs, obtaining fifty-six names. Wang Zhaoming (汪兆銘) of Panyu (番禹) wrote them down, and they were engraved in stone. Zou Lu (鄒魯) of Dapu (大埔) wrote an account of the events. Three years later, in the eleventh year of the Republic (1922), sixteen more names were obtained and added. Thus, the seventy-two were complete.

Tomb of the Seventy-Two Martyrs of Huanghuagang
Hu Hanmin
In the revolutionary campaign that occurred in Guangzhou on March 29th, Xinhai year, the party members who died for the cause were too numerous to count. Among them, Mr. Pan Dawei (潘達微君) managed to find 72 bodies and buried them together at Huanghuagang. Thus arose the name "Seventy-Two Martyrs of Huanghuagang."
Mr. Pan was also a party member like us. Having barely escaped arrest, he later, amidst the turmoil, resolutely set out to find the bones of his deceased comrades. Truly, how could this not be called a difficult deed?
In the following year, the first year of the Republic of China, Mr. Hu Hanmin (胡漢民君) and Mr. Chen Jiongming (陳炯君) successively held the post of Governor-General of Guangdong. They agreed to renovate the burial site and secured passage of 100,000 yuan in funding from the Provincial Assembly.
In the second year of the Republic (1913), due to internal strife, this could not be completed. In the autumn of the seventh year (1918), Army Division Commander Mr. Fang Shengtao (方聲濤君) finally began the tomb restoration, establishing a basic structure. Later, Assembly Speaker Mr. Lin Sen (林森군) built the monument and pavilion, recording the achievements so they would not be obscured (煙沒) for posterity.
However, engraving the names and origins (貫) of those who died that day was extremely difficult, as only fellow participants could know, and even they often did not. (Omitted from original text)
The number of deaths in the Xinhai revolutionary turmoil was not limited to 72, and even for those 72, it was difficult to know all their names and origins. How could this not be lamentable? (Omitted from original text) Lin Sen, Hu Hanmin, and others diligently investigated and managed to identify 56 individuals. (Omitted from original text)
Thus, the bones of the 72 martyrs were buried. Although some names are missing today, we hope to supplement them all in the future when other martyrs are identified. In essence, was it the wish of the party members, whose goal was to die wrapped in horsehide (馬革裏), to have their bones buried in the earth? This is done merely as something for later generations to use for memorial tributes (吊辭). It was done by us, irrespective of the wishes of the deceased.
Alas, those lost in this campaign were not only the elite (精銳) of our party but truly the finest talents (俊良) of the nation. Henceforth,
How great was the material sacrifice up to this point! Only the aspirations, integrity, and conduct (志節操行) of the party members shone forth... (Omitted)
However, we feel that national difficulties are endless, and talented individuals pass away easily.

Eve of the Xinhai Revolution

Now, let me speak of this Xinhai Revolution. At the end of the 33rd year of Guangxu (光緖) (40th year of Meiji, 1907), Sun Wen and Huang Xing (黃興) joined hands and raised troops in Guangxi (廣西). This was the second year after the formation of the Chinese Revolutionary Alliance (中國同盟會). It was the first time Sun Wen himself stood at the head of the troops (陳頭).
December 2nd, telegram received at the Hanoi Revolutionary Headquarters—
From midnight on the 1st to dawn on the 2nd, troops were raised near Namo Village (那模村), <26> immediately capturing the three key positions (三歲要) atop the mountain at Zhennan Pass (鎭南關), and the revolutionary flag flew everywhere.
At the headquarters, shouts of "Manse!" (Long live!) erupted simultaneously. Zhennan Pass in Guangxi Province borders French Tonkin (佛蘭西領 東京), with an altitude of 1,000 meters. It was a fortress that troubled the French army during the Sino-French War (淸佛戰爭), a naturally fortified position called the second Lüshun (旅順 - Port Arthur).
Near Zhennan Pass, based in a village called Namo (那模), were leaders of brave bandits (土匪) who extended their influence throughout the area. Appearing and disappearing in the region, they not only harassed government troops but also occasionally crossed the border to attempt raids into the Tonkin region, shocking the French border guards.
The leaders were Huang Mingtang (黃明堂), He Wu (何伍), and Li Huikeng (李輝鏗). Sun, Huang, and others, having repeatedly failed in uprisings in Guangdong, took notice of their actions and sought to utilize them.
At that time, Sun Wen, having been expelled from Japan and secretly hiding in Tonkin, sent people to meet with the French Governor-General. He proposed restraining the bandits' raids to prevent harm to French territory, in exchange for tacit permission for his comrades to infiltrate Guangxi Province from the French territory.
Having obtained the French Governor-General's understanding, funds were sent to the bandit leaders to involve them in the revolutionary army's uprising. According to this plan, the three leaders from Namo led about a hundred men and struck the rear of Zhennan Pass. The brave men scaled the steep cliffs (斷崖絶壁), jumped over the walls of the third battery, chased away the bewildered garrison soldiers, and then captured the second and first batteries, hoisting the three-colored revolutionary flag high on the ramparts.
When this news reached the Revolutionary Party Headquarters in Hanoi, Sun Wen, Huang Xing, Hu Hanmin, and his younger brother Hu Bacha (胡八叉), along with other key members, immediately left Hanoi, entered Namo Village, were welcomed by leaders He Wu and others, and stayed overnight before formally entering the Zhennan Pass fortress. Chi Hyŏnggil (池亨吉), who later wrote "Record of Witnessing the Chinese Revolution" (支那革命實見記), also joined the campaign at this time at Sun Wen's request. Irregular forces (游勇) from near and far rushed to join, bringing the troop strength to over 400. The government troops driven out from the Zhennan Pass fortress retreated to their main camp at the foot of the mountain. There, 2,000 soldiers were stationed, and Lu Rongting (陸榮廷), known as a giant among Southern warlords (南方軍閥), held fast. They were unlikely to yield easily to the revolutionary army. Indeed, at dawn the next day, a counterattack began. The revolutionary army had captured the three forts, but they did not know how to operate the captured Krupp cannons (크릎砲). Fortunately, there was a French artillery captain, and under this expert's command, they could open fire simultaneously and bombard fiercely.
After holding the fortress for four or five days, Sun and Huang returned to Tonkin following the confident requests of Huang Mingtang and others to go there and handle the supply of food and ammunition. However, their efforts were in vain; neither military funds nor ammunition could be obtained, only increasing Sun and Huang's anxiety. Meanwhile, 3,000 government reinforcements surrounded the fortress. Finally, on the 9th, the revolutionary army abandoned the three forts and retreated in defeat. Sun Wen and others were also expelled from French Annam (安南). <27>

Yunnan Retreat

Although the defeat at Zhennan Pass occurred, their fighting spirit was by no means broken. Half a year later, in April of the following year, Sun Wen's faction planned an uprising in Yunnan (雲南). Leaving Laokai (勞開 - Lao Cai), the terminus of the Tonkin-Yunnan Railway, and crossing the border leads to Hekou (河口). The government stationed several thousand troops in this area to guard the border region.
The revolutionary army's plan was first to capture Hekou, then immediately advance north to occupy Mengzi (蒙自), Kaihua (開化), and Lin'an (臨安) in Yunnan's Lin'an Prefecture (臨安府), and further push towards the provincial capital, Yunnan Fu (雲南府 - Kunming). The leader of one contingent was Huang Mingtang, who had fought fiercely at Zhennan Pass, along with Guan Renfu (關仁甫) and Zhang Deqing (張德卿), leaders of the Yunnan Triad Society (雲南 三會合). Hu Hanmin was chosen as the chief of staff.
Under the command of Hekou Governor (督辨) Wang Yufan (王玉藩), there were four battalions (營) of the Patrol and Defense Corps (巡防隊). Two of these battalions secretly supported the revolution. Wang Yufan's subordinate, Nŭngt'ong (能通), promised to dispose of Governor Wang and defect to the revolutionary army. While these collaborators repeatedly urged the revolutionary army for a swift uprising, their secret plot became known to Governor Wang. Meanwhile, eight comrades remaining undercover in Hanoi were arrested; only Hu Hanmin luckily escaped. Huang Mingtang and the other two leaders, on the night of March 29th, led 300 soldiers and suddenly attacked Hekou. Upon hearing the bugle call of the revolutionary army's advance, a unit of police soldiers, as previously arranged, killed their commander as a sacrifice (血祭) and welcomed the revolutionary army.
Governor Wang resisted stubbornly but, perhaps having exhausted his efforts, offered surrender on the evening of the next day, the 30th. However, it was merely a desperate measure (窮餘の一策). During a meeting with Wang Huaiting (王槐廷) from the revolutionary army who came to meet Wang (Yufan), he suddenly drew his sword and cut him down.
Nŭngt'ong, the collaborator who rushed over at the noise, ordered several subordinates to shoot Governor Wang dead.
The Hekou area was completely occupied by the revolutionary army. The revolutionary flag also fluttered over the battery on the mountain above Hekou. At this time, Huang Xing, appointed commander-in-chief of the revolutionary army by Sun Wen, was heading towards Hekou. Fortunately avoiding search parties, he managed to slip back into French territory but was eventually captured by French authorities at the border, suspected of being Japanese.
Huang Xing was taken to Hanoi and ordered to leave.
Huang Mingtang and the others parted ways with the main revolutionary army, advanced north, and confronted government forces in the Mengzi-Kaihua area. However, lacking a commander-in-chief, they lost cohesion. Furthermore, as usual, they failed to secure supplies (軍需), and after about 20 days, they had to abandon all occupied points and withdraw bitterly. This was the battle of the Seventy-Two Martyrs of Huanghuagang. <28>

**Summary**

The article, written by "Hwanghangnuin," recounts a visit to the Tomb of the 72 Martyrs of the Huanghuagang Uprising (associated with the 1911 Xinhai Revolution) in Guangdong, China, in 1939. It describes the tomb site, its history, and transcribes/translates the monument inscriptions detailing the difficulty in identifying all 72 martyrs initially. The latter half narrates the historical context, focusing on the failed revolutionary attempts led by Sun Yat-sen and Huang Xing preceding the main 1911 revolution: the Zhennan Pass Uprising (1907) involving cooperation with local bandits and French authorities, and the Hekou Uprising in Yunnan (1908), which also ended in failure due to internal betrayal, lack of leadership coordination, and supply issues. The article explicitly links the Hekou failure to the Huanghuagang martyrs' battle, though historically the Huanghuagang Uprising itself was a separate event in Guangzhou in April 1911.

For historians of Korean colonial history, this article is interesting as it shows a Korean author's deep interest in and knowledge of the Chinese Republican revolution, framing it sympathetically as a struggle of patriots. Published in Korea under Japanese rule, the focus on Chinese revolutionary martyrs and failed uprisings against an established regime (Qing, analogous to Japanese rule) could carry subtle anti-colonial undertones or reflect a shared Asian interest in revolutionary movements. The author's journey and detailed reporting suggest a connection or fascination among some Koreans with China's path to modernization and revolution. The mention of a Korean companion (Dr. Kim) and a Korean witness (Chi Hyŏnggil) to revolutionary events further highlights potential Korean involvement or observation.

黃花岡 七十二烈士墓, 廣東있는 그의 墓를 차저
						黃鶴樓人
저 史上에 유명한 辛亥革命의 72열사의 묘를 차즈려 나는 巴里로 가는 金박사와 함께 나섯다. 廣東郊外 동편 너른 新長路에 나서서 석양이 벌서 빗기기 시작한다. 진실로 廣東은 삼림의 도회라 이르느니만치 이 新長路 좌우 길거리에도 놉히자란 巨樹가 列을 지여섯다. 길도 아스팔드로 포장된 탄탄대로로서 문화건설에 분주한 틈에도 志士의 靈을 尊崇하느라고 先着한 정부 당국자의 그 뜻을 이해할 수 있었다.
한참 가다가 보니 눈압헤 크다란 石門이 노여 있고 거기에는
「浩氣長存」
이라고 孫文이 쓴 금색칠 한 懸額이 번듯하게 놉히 걸녀 있었다.
거기에서 콩그리드로 지은 虹橋같은 石段을 쓱 올나서서 층층대를 너머서면 目前에 약 20尺가량 될 것 같은 크다란 石碑가 서고 있는데 거기에는 우리가 찻고 찻든 「七十二烈士之墓」
라는 七字가 굵다라케 삭여있다. 그 압헤는 어느 뜻있는 後人들이 갓다노앗는지, 향나무와 장미꼿다발이 마치 巴里나 華盛頓의 무명전사기념비 前에서 보드시 가득 노여있고 한 구통이에서는 향불 연기 한가달이 고요히 올나솟고 있는 것까지 보였다.
이 碑가 辛亥3월29일(民國元年의 바로 前해이니 지금부터 28년전이 된다) 孫文 등의 지도에 의하여 뜻이 놉고 혈기에 뛰는 청년혁명군이 廣東을 점령코저 처들어 갓스나<24> 舊軍閥의 逆擊으로 그만 大志를 이루지 못하고 도로혀 잡혀서 모다 총살되었다. 그 뒤 간신히 동지들 손으로 그 죽은 死體72人 것을 모아, 胡漠民, 陳炯明 등의 손으로 희생동지의 建碑를 한 것이나 드른즉 처음에는 성명이 판명된 것이 겨우 56人이고 그밖에 것은 몰났으나 그양 한데 收容하였다 한다. 그리다가 民國8년에 이르러 남저지 16人것도 성명을 알게 되여 無名戰士를 면한 殉國72魂을 모다 厚葬하게 되었다 한다. 지금 석양에 빗긴 이 碑는 무었을 말하려섯는고 감개 자못 悵然한 바 있었다. 이제 그 碑文을 벗기여볼가.

廣州辛亥三月二十九日之役, 黨人死事者, 基數不可稽, 事後潘君達微收黨人尸得七十二, 合葬之于黃花岡, 由是有黃花岡七十二烈士之稱. 潘君亦黨人, 自以未名捕, 乃於危疑震撼之際, 毅然出收死友之骨, 可謂難矣. 基明年爲中華民國元年, 胡君漢民陳君烱明相繼任廣東都督, 議就當日合葬處修茸而整飾之, 省議會通過經費十萬圓, 二年亂作遂不果, 七年秋, 愼軍師長方君聲濤始募修故墓, 規模粗具, 參議長林君森復募建碑亭及紀功坊, 俾不致湮沒于後世, 然欲擧當日死事者姓名籍貫一一刻之於碑, 事乃至難, 蓋擧事之際務愼密, 凡姓名籍貫, 同事者非素識不能知, 且亦不願知之故, 今日同事之未死者, 其所能擧, 亦惟素識者已. 夫死事者旣不止七十二人, 卽此七十二人亦不能盡擧其姓名籍貫, 可不痛歟. 魯與朱君大符皆同事之未死者也, 相與徵集事實, 而所得死事者之姓名籍貫林君森更約當日未死同事之在오者胡君毅何君克夫 吳永珊徐君維揚等, 以確爲之證, 計得五十有六人, 其中有姓名而無籍貫者尙有三人, 先行刻之于碑, 而留空白, 以俟續有所知, 得以補元焉. 顔*黃花岡七十二烈士之碑, 蓋埋骨者固七十二人 今日雖有所闕, 周望他日能補而足之也. 夫馬革裏尸黨人之志埋骨己非所期, 遑論留名, 今之爲此, 徒以後人流連憑吊之資於死事者固無輿也. 烏呼此役所喪失者, 不特吾黨之精銳而已, 蓋合國中之俊良以爲一炬, 其物質之犧牲不可爲不大, 然精神所激發, 使天下了然於黨人之志節操行, 與革命之不可以已, 故不踰年而中華民國遂告成, 則其關係寧不重歟. 然念國難之無窮, 賢才之易盡, 執筆作記, 又不勝後死之感也.

黃花岡七十二烈士墓
胡漢民
辛亥 3월 29일에 廣州에서 이러난 革命之役에 당원으로서 殉死한 자가 그 수를 헤아릴 수 없이 만했다. 그 중에서 潘君達君이 시체 72位를 겨우 찾아서 黃花岡에 合葬하다. 이리하야 黃花岡七十二烈士의 일흠이 生하였다.
潘君은 亦 우리와 같은 黨人이라 겨우 建捕를 면하였고 그 뒤 곳 소란한 중에도 의연히 出奔하여 죽은 동지의 뼈를 찻다 진실로 이 엇지 더러운 일이 아니라 하랴.
그 이듬해인 중화민국 元年에 胡漢民君과 陳炯君이 서로 廣東都督을 相繼하게되자 議가 合하야 合葬한 바를 整飾키로 하야 그 경비 10만원이 省議會를 통과하다.
민국2년에 국내의 亂으로 그가 끗마추지 못하다가 7년 가을에 軍師長과 方聲濤君이 비로소 그 修墓에 착수하여서 규모를 약간 만들었고 다시 參議長 林森군이 碑와 亭子를 만들어 공을 기록하여 후세에라도 煙沒함이 없도록 하였다.
그러나 당일의 死者의 氏名과 貫까지 삭이여 두는 것은 일이 몹시 곤란하여 同事者가 아니면 능히 알기 어려웠다. (中略-원문)
辛亥革命亂에 死者가 72人만에 不止하였고 그 72人조차 名籍貫을 다 알기 어려우니 엇지 통탄할 일 아니라. (中略-원문) 林森, 胡漢民군 등이 애써 조사하여 56人은 알계 되다. (中略-원문)
이리하야 72烈士의 뼈를 뭇다. 오늘에는 비록 빠진 수가 있으나, 他日 殉死者를 모다 補足코저 하노라. 대체 馬革裏에 죽엄된 黨人의 뜻이 엇지 흙속에 뼈가 무치는 것이 願이었으랴. 다만 後人이 吊辭할 資로 삼고저 할 뿐이노라. 죽은 이의 뜻에는 아모 상관 없이 吾人들이 하였을 뿐이노라.
오호, 이 役에서 상실된 자 吾黨의 精銳일 뿐 아니라 실로 중간의 俊良이노라. 이에
이까지의 물질의 희생이 엇지 크다 하랴. 오직 黨人의 志節操行이 渙發되어지이도 (中略)
그러나 國難은 무궁하고 賢才는 가기 쉬움을 늣기노라.

辛亥革命前夜

이제 이 辛亥革命을 말하리라. 光緖33년(明治40년)말 孫文과 黃興과는 相携하여 兵을 廣西에 起하였다. 中國同盟會 結成의 翌翌年이 다 孫文 스사로 陳頭에 선 것은 이때가 처음이다.
12월 2일 河內革命本部의 入電-
1일 夜半부터 2일 새벽에 互하여 那模村 부근에 兵을 擧하야<26> 곳 鎭南關山顚의 三歲要를 奪取 革命旗를 각 처에 날니였다.
본부에선 일제히 「만세」소리가 터젔다. 廣西省 鎭南舘은 佛蘭西領 東京과 경계를 접하고 해발 千米突, 일즉이 淸佛戰爭때 佛軍을 괴롭힌 요새로 제 2의 旅順이라 불니우는 天險의 地다.
이 鎭南關 갓가운 那模라 하는 촌락을 근거로 하여 그 일대에 세력을 뻐치는 용감한 土匪의 頭들이 있었다. 그들은 그 일대를 출몰하면서 官兵을 괴롭힐 뿐 아니라 때때로 국경을 넘어서 東京지방에도 약탈의 원정을 試하고 佛蘭西 국경경비병을 震駭식혔다.
두목은 黃明堂, 何伍, 李輝鏗의 3인이였다. 廣東擧兵에 실패를 거듭한 孫, 黃 등은 그들의 행동에 着目하여 이것을 이용하려고 했다.
즉 그 때 日本에서 쪼껴서 몰내 東京에 숨어 있은 孫文은 사람을 보내여 佛蘭西總督을 회견케하고 그들 토비의 약탈을 取締하야 佛蘭西領을 닷치지 않게 하는 대신 동지들이 佛領방면에서 廣西省에 잠입하는 것을 黙許하여 달나고 하였다.
佛蘭西總督의 양해를 어드매 곳 두목들에게 金額을 부처서 革命軍의 擧兵에 가담 식혔다 이 計劃策에 當하여 那模의 3두목은 手兵 백여人을 이끌어 鎭南舘의 배후를 질었다. 용맹한 그들은 斷崖絶壁向을 바라올으며 제3砲臺의 담벽에 뛰어들어 황당해 하는 守備兵을 쪼차서 다시 제2 제1의 砲臺를 빠트리 壘上에 높이 3色의 革命旗를 번득였다.
이 첩보가 河內革命黨 本部에 達한즉 孫文 黃興이하 胡漢民 及 그 동생 胡八叉 등 각 간부는 곳 河內를 떠나 那模村에 들어와 두목 何伍 등에게 영접을 받고 밤을 새워서 당당히 鎭南舘 요새에 들어 갔다. 뒤에 「支那革命實見記」를 쓴 池亨吉도 이때 孫文의 依囑을 받어 종군 했다. 遠近의 游勇들도 달여와서 兵數는 4백여에 달했다. 鎭南關要塞에서 쪼끼운 官兵은 山下의 本營에 退하였다. 거기엔 2천의 兵이 있고 南方軍閥의 巨摯이라 이칼으는 陸榮廷이 固守하고 있다. 그것까지 쉽게 革命軍에게 내줄 리가 없다. 과연 翌日새벽에 逆襲戰이 개시 되었다. 혁명군은 겨우 3개의 요새를 점령하긴 했으나 鹵獲한 크릎砲를 操縱할 줄 몰났다. 다행히 佛蘭西사람 砲兵 대위 하나가 있었음으로 이 전문가 지휘 아래에 일제히 砲門을 열고 猛射할 수 있었다.
뒤에 사오일은 요새를 固守함으로 그 사이에 동경에 가서 식량과 탄약의 보급에 當해 달나는 黃明黨 등의 快意에 따라서 孫, 黃들은 다 동경에 引返하였다. 그러나 그들의 노력은 헜되여 軍資도 탄약도 손에 들어보지 못하고 孫黃의 초조만 더해갈 뿐이였다. 그 사이에 官兵 3천의 援軍은 요새를 둘너 쌌다. 드디어 9일 혁명군은 3요새를 放棄하고 敗退하였다. 孫文 등도 또한 佛領安南으로부터 추방당했다. <27>

雲南敗退

鎭南關의 一敗가 있었지만 그들의 투지는 결코 꺽기우지 않었다. 반년 후인 翌年 4월에 그들 孫文一派는 雲南 據兵을 획책하였다. 東京 雲南鐵道 終點勞開를 나와서 국경을 넘으면 河口가 있다. 정부는 이 땅에 수천의 병을 두어 국경 일대의 경비를 當케 하였다.
혁명군은 爲先 이 河口를 탈취하고 곳 北進에서 雲南臨安府의 蒙自 開化 臨安을 점령하고 더 나가서 省城 雲南府를 뚫으려는 계획였다. 一隊의 수령은 鎭南關에서 奪戰한 黃明堂 及 雲南 三會合의 두목 關仁甫 張德卿 등이였다. 참모에는 胡漢民이 선택되었다.
河口督辨王玉藩의 輩下에 四營의 巡防隊가 屬하여 있었다. 그 중 二營까지는 혁명에 內應하였다. 王玉藩의 부하 能通은 王督辨을 埋葬하고 혁명군에게 투항하기를 豫約하였다. 이들의 內應者가 번번히 혁명군의 쾌속한 궐기를 促하고 있는 사이에 그들의 密謀는 王督辨의 아는 배가 되었다. 一方 河內에 남어서 잠복한 8명의 동지는 체포되고 胡漢民만이 요행이 탈주하였다. 黃明黨 등 三頭目은 3월 29일 夜半 3백의 兵勇을 携하고 急*河口를 습격하였다. 革軍진격의 나팔소리를 드르면 그것도 일즉이 打合이 된 경찰병의 一隊는 대장을 血祭로 하여 革軍을 영접한 것이다.
王督辨은 완강히 저항했으나 盡力했든지 翌30일 석양 투항을 申入하였다. 그러나 그것은 窮餘의 一策에 지나지 않았다. 王에게 온 革軍의 王槐廷과 회견 중 돌연 劒을 빼여 이것을 버히였다.
소음에 달여온 內應者 能通은 부하 數名에게 명하여 王督辨을 총살식혔다.
河口일대는 완전히 혁명군 손에 의하여 점령되었다. 河口山上의 砲臺에도 革命旗가 번득였다. 이 때 黃興은 혁명군 총수로 되어 孫文의 命을 바더 河口에 향하였다. 다행히 수색의 손을 피하여 다시 佛領內에 잠입했으나 드디여 국경에서 佛蘭西官憲에게 잡히었다. 그런데 그것은 日本사람으로 의심바든 때문이다.
黃興은 河內에 보여 거기서 退去명령을 바덧다.
黃明堂 등은 革軍과 途를 갈너서 北進하고 蒙自 開化일대에서 官憲과 對峙했으나 총수 없는 때문에 통일을 잃을 뿐 아니라 例대로 軍需의 공급을 엇지 못하여 20여 일로 占據地點 전부를 放棄하고 한을 품고 退散하지 않으면 안되었다. 이것이 黃花岡七十二烈士의 싸흠이였다. <28>
