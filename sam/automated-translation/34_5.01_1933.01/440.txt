同情
Sympathy

A man who was watching a seabed dredging crane from the shore.
"Oh, that's terrible."
Another person: "What is?"
That person: "I mean the person scooping mud from under the sea."

禁酒의 悲哀
The Sorrow of Abstinence

Doctor: "You've recovered completely. Now, if you just abstain from alcohol for about 3 more months, you'll be perfectly healthy."
Patient: "Doctor! Do I really need to be *that* healthy? Please tell me truthfully."

實證
Actual Proof

Girl: "Oh, Mother, there's a white hair on your head."
Mother: "That's because you don't listen to me well enough-"
Girl: (Looking at the white hair of the grandmother sitting nearby) "Gosh- Mother, you're even worse than me, look at Grandmother's hair!"

千萬에
By No Means

A gentleman who ran into a watch shop. To the Shopkeeper: "Hey! Didn't you guarantee when you sold this watch that it wouldn't matter until I died?"
Shopkeeper: "Yes, yes. Oh, my apologies. Uh- when you came to buy this watch, your face was jaundiced, and it looked like you'd be needing a coffin plank (칠성판) within five days- uh- uh."<102>

**Summary**

This article presents four short, humorous anecdotes or jokes. The first involves a misunderstanding about how a dredging crane works. The second highlights a patient's reluctance to give up alcohol for health. The third is a witty exchange between a daughter, mother, and grandmother about white hair and disobedience. The fourth features a customer complaining about a faulty watch and the shopkeeper's morbidly humorous excuse based on the customer's appearance at the time of purchase. These vignettes offer glimpses into everyday conversations and humor in 1930s Korea, touching upon themes like simple misunderstandings, health habits, family dynamics, and consumer interactions, potentially reflecting common societal attitudes or observations of the time. Historians might find interest in the specific style of humor, the language used (including older spellings), and the mundane situations depicted, offering a small window into social interactions during the colonial period.
