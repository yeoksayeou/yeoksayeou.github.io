Reconnaissance on the Life Front

1, The Strange Old Man on the Street

Pushing through the thick door (또어) of the café "Bonami," A and B emerged into the darkness of the Chongno intersection, nearing midnight. They were exchanging words about the impression left by the movie *Ben-Hur*, which they had just seen at Umigwan.

A: "After being deeply moved like that, I feel quite refreshed. I nearly cried several times, but held back."

B: "How can a big fellow like you be so sentimental?"

A: "That actress was pretty..."

The words trailed off.

Looking down at the traces of sparse snowflakes disappearing on the tips of their enamel (에나맬) shoes, the two walked on silently, hands thrust deep into their overcoat pockets (포겟트), enjoying the chilly sensation of the early winter air on their faces.

Perhaps the desire to be alone now arose in A's mind. Why? Because the time was about to pass 12 PM, the streetcar rushing along the rails (렐) shouting 'Ah-ah' had few passengers, and it seemed as if some great dream was about to roll down onto the quiet pavement (페이부멘트).<98>

Just as the two were about to turn the corner by Hwasin (和信), a passing old man suddenly clung to A's sleeve, crying out.

"Sir—"

The old man wore a worn-out fedora pulled down over a *turumagi* coat that had turned grey from stains (무더서). His back was slightly bent, and in the dim streetlight faintly illuminating his face, his nose was high and his cheeks gaunt (깍겻다).

A, also raising his voice.

"Ah—it's been a long time," he said, stopping.

B paused his steps for a moment, but seeing the seemingly familiar reunion (邂逅) between A and the old man, he walked on so as not to interfere. As he walked, he thought.

"A certainly has all sorts of friends."

After a while, A caught up, and B asked.

B: "Who was that old man you were so happy to see?"

A: "Happy? Not really. It was just that old man."

According to A, their acquaintance dated back a long time, to when A had briefly been something of a delinquent.

"Ah—is that so?" B finally nodded. "So what were you whispering (쑤근거렷나) about?"

"That crazy old man. He said something about a judge's sister-in-law being available, or something. He kept pestering me about it. In the end, I lost 20 *chŏn* to him." A strange old man, hiding in the shadows of the bright streetlights at night, actively moving about. Isn't he too, perhaps, bravely deploying his battle lines in the back alleys of the night streets for the sake of survival (生活)? (To be continued in the next issue-original text) <99>

**Summary**

Two friends, A and B, leave a café late at night in Chongno, Seoul, after watching the movie *Ben-Hur*. As they walk, A is accosted by a destitute-looking old man whom A vaguely knows from his past. The old man begs for money, making a strange proposition, and A gives him 20 *chŏn*. A describes the man as "crazy" but also reflects that the old man is fighting his own battle on the "life front" (生活戰線). This short piece provides a snapshot of urban nightlife and social encounters in 1930s colonial Seoul, highlighting themes of poverty, past associations, and the struggle for existence metaphorically framed as a battlefront. Historians might find the depiction of specific Seoul locations (Chongno, Umigwan, Hwasin), the social interaction revealing class or status differences, the mention of popular culture (Ben-Hur), and the use of the term "life front" reflective of the socio-economic anxieties and metaphors prevalent during the colonial period interesting. The mix of Korean and loanwords also reflects cultural shifts.

1, 街上의 怪老人
喫茶店 「보나미」의 두터운 「또어에 밀려 자정 갓가운 鐘路 네거리의 어둠 속에 뛰여 나온 A와 B. 그들은 방금 얼마 전에 優美舘야서 본 영화 『번허』의 인상에 대하야 말을 주고 밧군다.
A 『한바탕 감격하고 나니 아주 씨워한걸. 몃 번 울 번 울 번하다가 마럿지.』
B 『크다란 사람이 그러케 쎈티멘탈하고 어대쓰나.』
A 『그 여배우 입부지』
말은 꿎엇다.
두 사람은 『에나맬』의 구두끄테 싸라지는 드문 눈송이 자취를 구버보면서 두 손을 외투 포겟트 속에 꾹 박은 채 말없이 거러가면서 일흔 겨울의 쌀쌀한 감촉을 얼골 우에 줄기고 잇엇다.
A의 마음속에는 『인제부터는 혼차 되엿스면』하는 욕망이 떠올라 왓슬지도 모른다. 웨 그려냐 하면 때는 오후 12시를 지나려고 하고 『렐』 우에서 『아아』 고함을 치며 달리는 전차에는 손님이 드물고 고요한 『페이부멘트』 우에는 바야흐로 『무슨 크다란 꿈이 굴러 떠러질 듯 하엿기 때문이다.＜98＞
두 사람이 『和信』 녑구리를 끼고 도라가려고 할 때 돌년 지나가든 늙은 사나히 한 분이 A의 소매에 매달리면서.
『나리-』하고 소리친다.
때가 무더서 회색이 된 두루마기 우에 귀죽은 낡은 중절모를 늘러 쓴 그 늙은이의 허리는 조끔 구부럿고 히미한 街燈에 어슴푸례 빗최는 그 얼골의 코는 놉고 볼작은 깍겻다.
A 역시 소리놉게.
『아-오래간만일세』하면서 멈춰선다.
B는 거름을 잠간 멈췃다가 퍽 익숙해 보이는 A와 그 늙은이의 邂逅를 방해할가보아서 그냥 거럿다. 거르면서 그는 생각하엿다.
『A에게는 별 친구가 다 잇는걸.』
이슥이 잇다가 쪼차온 A에게 B는 무럿다.
B 『웬 늙은이기에 그리 반가위하는가.
A 『반갑기는 무얼. 그런 늙은이가 잇엇지』
A의 말에 의하면 두 사람의 친교는 벌서 녯날. A가 잠간 불량을 부린 일이 잇던 때에 잇은 것이라고 한다.
『아-그런가』 그제야 B의 고개는 꺼덕거린다. 『그래 무슨 이야기를 그러케 쑤근거렷나?』
『미친 늙은이. 무어 무슨 판사의 처제가 잇다나. 엇던가고 졸라대겟지. 필경 20전을 빼앗겻지.』 밤거리의 밝은 등불 그늘에 숨어 댕기면서 활약하는 괴상하 늙은이. 그도 역시 생활을 위하야 밤거리의 골목골목에 勇壯하게 전선을 편 것이나 아닐가? (次號續-원문) ＜99＞
