Chinju Folk Song
						Chunjō

Chinju alley, deep alley<105>
Mr. Ha's eldest daughter
Because the rumor spread that she's so pretty
When I went to see her once
They said she went out
When I went to see her twice
They said she hadn't come back
When I went to see her ten times
They said she had fallen ill
When I asked to see the sick girl
With her mother
Drawing her eyebrows
Five *toe* (升) of oil
Five *toe* of powder
Five *toe* of rouge
Ah, I didn't know about the fifteen *toe*!

End
(Author and details unknown) <106>

**Summary**

This article presents a Korean folk song (minyo) from Chinju. The song humorously describes the persistent efforts of a speaker to see a famously beautiful girl, the eldest daughter of a Mr. Ha. Each attempt is met with an excuse – she's out, she hasn't returned, or she's sick. Finally, upon trying to visit the supposedly sick girl, the speaker discovers her elaborate makeup routine involving large quantities of oil, powder, and rouge, implying her "sickness" was just the time taken to prepare herself.

From a historical perspective, the publication of a regional Korean folk song in a major magazine during the colonial period is noteworthy. It reflects an interest in preserving or documenting local Korean culture, although the author appears to have a Japanese name (Chunjō). The poem offers a glimpse into social customs and ideals of beauty (indicated by the extensive use of cosmetics) in 1930s Korea, specifically Chinju. The use of older spellings and potentially dialectal forms ("골묵", "맛딸애기", "기시고") is also of linguistic interest.
