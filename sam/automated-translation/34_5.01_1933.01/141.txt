We apologize that the Samch'ŏlli New Year issue has come out late due to certain circumstances (某事情).<43>

**Summary**

This brief notice is an apology from the editors of the Samch'ŏlli magazine to its readers for the delay in publishing the New Year's issue in January 1933. The reason given is vague, cited only as "certain circumstances." From a historical perspective, this apology is interesting because the unspecified "circumstances" could hint at various difficulties faced by publishers during the Japanese colonial period, such as financial troubles, logistical problems, or, perhaps most likely, issues with censorship or official interference which could not be explicitly stated.
