Lotus Pagoda, Composed at the House of Pak Ch'angsŏ in Sunch'ŏn
Ssangjŏn Kim Kye-du

The Jade Well's lotus flowers, ten *chang* red,
Purple clouds and an immortal's flute descend on the heavenly wind.
Poets compete in wishing boundless blessings,
At times, a clear fragrance falls into the wine cup.

Purple quilt, immortal's palm, jade hibiscus,
The morning sun especially fresh, the evening moon rich.
Brocade carp blow snow, standing beneath the flowers,
In leisure, the atmosphere is like a scene within a painting.

Sŏksong Yun Sŏkt'aek

Below the Lotus Pagoda, the river flows,
I wish to ask for the immortal's dwelling.
Day after day, the white spring wind blows,
Looking back, eastward, here within. <116>

**Summary**

This article presents two short poems written in Hanja by Kim Kye-du and Yun Sŏkt'aek. Composed during a visit to the house of Pak Ch'angsŏ in Sunch'ŏn, the poems celebrate the beauty of a "Lotus Pagoda" (perhaps a structure or a natural feature) and the surrounding scenery. Kim's poem evokes vibrant imagery of red lotuses, celestial sounds, and the convivial atmosphere of poets gathering, while Yun's poem offers a more contemplative reflection on the tranquil landscape and the search for an immortal's abode. From a historical perspective, the article showcases the continuation of traditional literati culture, specifically Hanja poetry composition and social gatherings focused on aesthetic appreciation, among educated Koreans during the colonial period. It reflects a cultural space potentially separate from the direct political sphere under Japanese rule.
