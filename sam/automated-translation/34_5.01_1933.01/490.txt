Author: 郭鍾守
Article Type: 시 (Poem)

When I sold off my southern fields and northern paddies (南田北畓),
I certainly had many friends,
But when the money in my pocket ran out,
I miss my friends so much I could die.
Never mind, as the old folks used to say,
They call them "drinking buddies."

A body troubled by the world's hardships (世苦)
Lies upon a sickbed,
I miss my friends, yes, but
Do you mean not even a sick visit comes?
Is friendship (情誼) in this world
Over once the liquor cups are put away?

When making friends,
I befriended them out of loyalty (情義),
But they liked it when I spent money,
And pretend not to see me when I cannot.
Alas, this fickle mentality (요부심리),
Oh people, should you laugh scornfully at it? (End) <105>

**Summary**

This poem by Kwak Chong-su laments the superficiality of "drinking buddies" who flock around when one has money but disappear during hard times, like illness or poverty. The poet contrasts this fair-weather friendship with true loyalty (情誼), expressing bitterness and disillusionment when even a sickbed visit is absent. The poem uses the term "fickle mentality" (요부심리), metaphorically comparing such friends to temptresses, questioning whether such behavior should be scorned. From a historical perspective, the poem reflects social commentary on human relationships amid potential economic hardship in colonial Korea. The explicit mention of selling land (南田北畓) and the focus on money troubles could offer historians insight into the social and economic pressures faced by individuals during that period.

술친구, 詩歌
						郭鍾守
南田北畓 팔아쓸 때
친구들도 만엇건만
내 주머니 돈 떠러지니
친구 글이워 못살겟다
두워라 녯 노인 하시든 말삼
술친구라 일으더라.

世苦에 시달닌 몸이
병상에 누웟스니
친구도 그립다 만은
문병좃차 업단 말가
세상에 친구 情誼란
술잔 노면 고만인가.

친구를 사괼 적에
情義로 사굇것만
돈 쓸 때 조와하고
돈 못쓰니 본체만체
어이타 요부심리를
사람아 비웃을 소냐. (끗) ＜105＞
