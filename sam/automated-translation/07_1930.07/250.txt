The Origin of Pen Names

Siram Kwŏn Tong-jin
I was originally called Udang (憂堂). Then, after serving a three-year sentence for the March 1st Movement and being released from prison, Son Ŭi-am (孫義庵) and several others from the Ch'ŏndogyo Church (天道敎會), who all used pen names ending with the character Am (庵), as well as Mr. O Se-ch'ang (奧世昌), suggested that I change my pen name too. I decided I wanted something substantial and to work practically, so I took the character *Sil* (實, meaning 'reality' or 'substance') and became Siram (實庵). I am also called Sirong (實翁). Even now, old acquaintances call me Udang or Siram, so I suppose I ultimately have three pen names.

Pongsan Yi Chong-nin
Pongsan (鳳山) comes from my hometown, Sŏsan in Ch'ungnam Province. In front of Sŏsan town (瑞山邑), there is a beautiful mountain peak called Ponghwangsan (鳳凰山). Although I left my hometown long ago due to worldly affairs and have wandered around, I can never forget the indescribable affection and nostalgic feeling (香味) for my hometown. To express this sentiment, I decided to take the mountain's name. However, I couldn't use all three characters, Ponghwangsan, so I removed the *Pong* (鳳) character and used Hwangsan (凰山). *Pong* refers to the male phoenix and *Hwang* to the female. While "Pongsan" might seem more correct, as stated in Lao Tzu's Theory of the Mysterious Female (玄牝說), the female is dynamic; though seemingly gentle on the surface (表面), she possesses a great power to embrace others. I chose this name when I was 15, attending a private village school for Classical Chinese (漢文私塾), and I have been using it for 34 years now.<55>

**Summary**

This article features two prominent figures, Kwŏn Tong-jin and Yi Chong-nin, explaining the origins of their pen names (雅號, *ahŏ*). Kwŏn Tong-jin, an independence activist involved in the March 1st Movement, changed his name from Udang to Siram after imprisonment, reflecting a desire for practical action, influenced by fellow Ch'ŏndogyo members. Yi Chong-nin chose Pongsan (originally Hwangsan), derived from Ponghwangsan mountain near his hometown of Sŏsan, expressing deep nostalgia and drawing philosophical inspiration from Lao Tzu regarding the strength of the feminine principle. From a historical perspective, the article is interesting as it reveals the personal reflections and motivations of Korean intellectuals and activists during the colonial period. Their choices of pen names were deeply personal yet connected to significant events like the March 1st Movement, religious affiliations (Ch'ŏndogyo), philosophical thought (Lao Tzu), and a poignant sense of longing for their hometowns under Japanese rule, highlighting how identity formation was intertwined with national consciousness and resistance.

雅號의 由來
實庵 權東鎭
나는 원래 憂堂이라 하엿다. 그러다가 3·1運動때 3년의 형을 치르고 출옥하자 孫義庵을 위시하야 天道敎會의 여러분들이 모다 庵字를 밋헤 두고 號를 지으며 奧世昌군 등이 작고 내 號도 갈나고 하기에 무에든지 實속잇게 또 실지로 일하여야 되겟다는 뜻으로 實字를 따다가 實庵이라하고 또 實翁이라고도 한다. 지금도 舊知들은 憂堂이라고도 불너주고 實庵이라고도 하여주니 결국 내 號는 3개라 할가.

鳳山 李鍾麟
鳳山이라 함은 나의 고향이 忠南 瑞山인데 瑞山邑의 前面에 鳳凰山이란 秀麗한 山嶽이 잇다. 비록 世事로 고향을 떠나 도라다닌지는 오래지만 고향에 대한 무에라 말할 수 업는 愛慕와 香味는 이즐 길이 업서서 그 심정을 표현하고저 그 山名을 따로 따다 쓰기로 하엿는데 그러타고 鳳凰山이라고 석자나 쓸 수 업서 鳳字를 떼어벅리고 凰山이라 하엿다. 鳳은 숫컷이고 凰은 암컷으로 긔왕이면 「鳳山」함이 올흔 것 갓트나 老子의 玄牝說에도 잇드시 암컷은 發動的이고 表面 順한 듯하나 남을 싸안는 힘이 위대한 바 잇다. 이 號가 漢文私塾 다니든 15세 당시의 지은 것이 벌서 34年을 써온 폭이 된다.＜55＞
