Literary Scene: News and Updates

Regarding Posŏk Cho Myŏnghŭi (抱石 趙明熙), he is the one widely known to the world for his two works of the novel "Naktonggang" (洛東江). He tried to make a living somehow, even by selling red bean porridge (팟죽), but when even that didn't go as planned, he kicked over his porridge container and abruptly left for Russia the year before last. Recent news indicates he is working as a school teacher in Vladivostok (海參威).
Anyway, he is a man of substance, so it is pleasing that he is doing substantial work.

Meanwhile, his daughter, whose father was sent abroad, is only 15 this year, but with a spirited mettle no less than her father's, she stepped onto the vocational front as a bus girl (뻐스껄) starting this spring. If Mr. Cho heard this, he would surely smile. Truly, like father, like daughter (斯父에 斯女야).

T'ansil Kim Myŏngsun (탄실 金明渟) quit her job as a female reporter for a certain newspaper and was seen flashing her elegant and delicate (姸細) figure here and there. News heard recently is that she has entered... is going to enter... seems likely to enter... a Japanese motion picture company as an actress.

Pyŏkch'o Kong Myŏnghŭi (碧初 共命熹) [Possibly a typo for Hong Myŏnghŭi (洪命熹)] was writing "The Tale of Im Kkŏkchŏng" (林巨正傳) for the Chosŏn Ilbo until last winter, but mid-writing, he ended up in chains due to the '11-person incident'. He was thus detained for many days at the Kyŏnggi Provincial Police Department (京畿道警察部). At that time, through the negotiation of the newspaper company, he received writing paper and an iron pen (鐵筆) [stylus] and wrote five installments inside. This must be the first instance (矯矢) of a prison literary work (獄中 作品) in Korea.

The song "Kangnamgok" (江南曲), composed by Kayo Association member Sŏksong Kim Tongwŏn (石松 金烔元), was set to music by Ewha College (梨花專門) music professor An Kiyŏng (安基永), considering traditional folk song styles to bring out Korean sentiment. It has already been performed several times at concerts and is said to have garnered absolute high praise.<56>

**Summary**

This article provides updates on several figures associated with the Korean literary and cultural scene in 1930. It reports that novelist Cho Myŏnghŭi, known for "Naktonggang," emigrated to Vladivostok and became a teacher after struggling financially in Korea. His young daughter began working as a bus girl. Former journalist Kim Myŏngsun is rumored to be pursuing an acting career in Japan. Writer Kong Myŏnghŭi (likely Hong Myŏnghŭi) continued writing installments of "The Tale of Im Kkŏkchŏng" while imprisoned by the Japanese police, marking a significant event in prison literature. Lastly, it notes the success of the song "Kangnamgok" by Kim Tongwŏn and composer An Kiyŏng, praised for its traditional Korean sentiment. From a historical perspective, the article reveals the precarious lives of intellectuals under colonial rule, showing emigration due to hardship (Cho), political imprisonment (Kong/Hong), the emergence of women in new professions (Cho's daughter, Kim), and efforts to maintain Korean cultural identity through music (Kim/An). The mention of Kong/Hong Myŏnghŭi writing *Im Kkŏkchŏng* in prison is particularly interesting for historians studying resistance and cultural production under duress.

文壇 張三李四
抱石 趙明熙군이라면 소설 「洛東江」 2편으로 세상에 그 文名을 널니 알니든 분이라. 팟죽 장사까지 하여서 엇더케나마 생활의 길을 열어 보려 하다가 그 조차 뜻대로 되지 안으니 팟죽통을 발길로 차고 漂然히 로서아로 간 것이 재작년 그랫드니 최근 소식에 海參威에서 학교교원 노릇을 한다고.
아무튼 무게 잇는 사람이라 무게 잇는 일을 하는 것이 깃분 일.
한편 아버지를 해외에 보낸 그의 따님은 금년 15살 밧게 아니 되엇스나 씩씩한 기개 아버지에 못지지 안어 뻐스껄로 今春부터 직업전선에 나섯다. 趙君이 드럿스면 미소할 걸 아무튼 斯父에 斯女야.
탄실 金明渟씨는 모 신문 여기자를 그만 두고 그 姸細한 자태를 동서로 번득이더니 요지음에 들니는 기별에 일본 어느 활동사진 회사의 여배우로 드리 갓다고...간다고...갈 것 갓다고.
碧初 共命熹가 작년 겨을까지 朝鮮日報에 「林巨正傳」을 썻는데 執筆中途에 그만 11인 사건으로 몸에 쇠사슬을 밧게 되엇다. 그래서 京畿道警察部에 여러 날 가처 잇섯는데 그 때 신문사의 교섭으로 원고지와 鐵筆의 差入을 밧고 그 안에서 5회분을 집필하엿스니 조선에서 옥중 윀‘품이라 할 것은 이것이 矯矢일거야.
가요협회회원 石松 金烔元군이 지은 「江南曲」이란 노래는 梨花專門音樂敎授 安基永씨가 在來의 民謠調를 참작하여 조선 정조가 드러나게 작곡을 부치엇는데 이미 여러 번 음악회에 上演되어 절대한 호평을 빗엇섯다고.＜56＞
