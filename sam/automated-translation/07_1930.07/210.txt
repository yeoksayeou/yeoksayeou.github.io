**Roundtable Discussion on Local Entertainment**

*   Time: January 28th, 2 PM

**Moderator:** Recently, various discussions about local culture have arisen from many quarters. Among these, local entertainment is a significant issue directly connected to the lives of the masses. This magazine also considers this problem important, and so we have arranged this roundtable discussion today, inviting you all here despite your busy schedules. It seems that our traditional local entertainment has significantly declined, almost to the point of extinction, while new forms of entertainment have not yet taken root among the general populace. Consequently, the lives of the masses seem extremely monotonous and dry. It appears that gambling (노름), which can hardly be called entertainment, is prevalent only in certain areas. We would like to hear your frank opinions on the current state of local entertainment, its points of decline, the reasons for it, and any constructive alternatives. First, Mr. Kim Munjip, please share your thoughts on the current situation.

**Kim Munjip:** When we speak of local entertainment, it seems to broadly encompass everything except what might be called urban entertainment. However, the concept of 'local' itself is quite ambiguous. Does it refer to agricultural villages? Fishing villages? Mountain villages? Or perhaps towns below the level of *ŭp* (邑)? The entertainment in each of these areas likely differs. Therefore, discussing 'local entertainment' as a single entity seems problematic from the outset. Generally, when we talk about local entertainment, we mostly refer to entertainment in agricultural villages. Looking at the current state of entertainment in these villages, as the moderator pointed out, it seems almost non-existent. Compared to the past, it has indeed severely declined. In the past, there were various seasonal customs (세시풍속) throughout the year – kite flying around the first full moon, *ch'ajŏnnori* (차전놀이), *sŏkchŏn* (석전), tug-of-war, mask dances (탈춤), puppet plays (꼭둑각시놀음), *nongak* (농악), shamanistic rituals (*kut*, 굿), and *p’ansori* (판소리), among others. These constituted the mainstream of past local entertainment. However, these have almost disappeared now. If anything remains, it might be *yutnori* (윷놀이) or flower card games (*hwatu*, 花鬪牌). Even *yutnori* seems less common now. Flower card games, which were originally gambling, seem to have become the representative form of entertainment. Traditional folk songs (민요) also seem to have vanished. Of course, new songs are spreading via radio and records, but it seems doubtful whether these have truly become the villagers' own entertainment.

**Moderator:** Mr. Kim Sangyong, what are your thoughts?

**Kim Sangyong:** I also believe that traditional local entertainment has largely disappeared. Activities like *nongak*, mask dances, puppet plays, *p’ansori*, and folk songs, which could be considered representative of traditional entertainment, are nearly gone. It’s hard to pinpoint the exact reasons for this decline. Perhaps the infiltration of modern civilization has rendered these old forms tasteless? Or maybe economic hardship has robbed people of the leisure (여가) to enjoy entertainment? Or perhaps it’s due to suppression by the authorities (관헌)? It’s likely a combination of these factors. In any case, the decline is undeniable. As Mr. Kim Munjip mentioned, only gambling like flower card games seems prevalent. This is truly deplorable.

**Pak T’aewŏn:** I haven't directly observed the situation in rural areas recently, so I can't speak confidently. However, based on common sense, it seems plausible that traditional entertainment has declined significantly. But is it accurate to say it has *completely* disappeared? I wonder if that's an exaggeration stemming from the intellectuals' perspective. While large-scale, village-wide traditional events might have diminished, perhaps smaller, simpler forms of entertainment still exist? For instance, maybe folk songs haven't entirely vanished but are sung individually or in small groups? Also, regarding gambling, while flower card games might be prevalent, isn't it possible that other forms of gambling exist too? However, I agree that, overall, traditional entertainment is in decline, and constructive forms are scarce.

**Yu Chino:** I agree with the general consensus that traditional local entertainment has severely declined. While the exact reasons are complex, as Mr. Kim Sangyong pointed out, the influence of modern civilization seems undeniable. Old forms feel outdated and uninteresting. Economic hardship is certainly a factor too. People lack the time and resources for entertainment. Suppression might also play a role, especially for large gatherings. However, I think the most fundamental reason is the change in lifestyle and consciousness. Traditional entertainment was deeply rooted in the old communal way of life and worldview. As these change, the entertainment based on them naturally loses its foundation. The problem is that new, healthy forms of entertainment haven't filled the void. Instead, only degenerative forms like gambling or passive consumption of entertainment like radio and records seem to be spreading.

**Moderator:** So, everyone seems to agree that traditional local entertainment is in decline, and healthy alternatives are lacking, with gambling being a significant issue. What could be the alternatives? Mr. Yu, could you elaborate on potential constructive entertainment?

**Yu Chino:** It's not easy to suggest specific alternatives. Creating new forms of entertainment isn't something that can be done overnight. However, perhaps we can find clues by looking at what forms of entertainment are currently enjoyed, even if passively. Radio, records, and movies (영화) are popular. While these are mostly consumed passively, could they be developed into more active forms? For example, could communities organize gatherings to listen to the radio or watch movies together, followed by discussions? Could existing folk songs be revived or adapted? Could new creative activities, like simple drama performances or sports activities, be encouraged? The key is to foster active participation and communal enjoyment, rather than passive consumption or degenerative activities like gambling. It also requires effort from intellectuals and authorities to guide and support these initiatives.

**Kim Sangyong:** I agree with Mr. Yu. Reviving or adapting traditional forms might be one way. For example, *nongak* has a vibrant rhythm and communal spirit. Could it be modernized or simplified? Folk songs also hold artistic value. Perhaps collecting, arranging, and disseminating them could stimulate interest? Encouraging new creative activities based on local life, like simple plays or storytelling gatherings, might also be effective. Sports activities, if adapted to local conditions, could promote physical health and community bonding. However, these require conscious effort and resources. Simply lamenting the decline isn't enough.

**Kim Munjip:** Promoting reading could also be considered a form of constructive entertainment. Providing access to books and encouraging reading habits could broaden perspectives and offer intellectual stimulation. Establishing simple libraries or reading rooms in villages could be a starting point. Also, regarding traditional forms, we need to be selective. Not all traditional entertainment is worth preserving. Some might be crude or promote undesirable values. We should focus on those with artistic merit and positive social functions. For example, mask dances often contained social satire and humor, which could still be relevant. *P'ansori* is a unique narrative art form. These could be adapted for modern audiences.

**Pak T’aewŏn:** I think we need to be realistic. Grand initiatives might be difficult to implement immediately due to resource constraints and lack of personnel. Perhaps starting small is better. Encouraging existing positive activities, however simple, could be a first step. For example, if *yutnori* is still played, perhaps organizing small village tournaments could enhance its enjoyment and communal aspect. If people enjoy singing, perhaps organizing informal singing gatherings? The focus should be on fostering whatever positive local initiatives already exist or can be easily encouraged, rather than imposing external models. Also, addressing the root causes, such as economic hardship and lack of leisure time, is crucial, although that's a larger socio-economic issue.

**Moderator:** Thank you all for your valuable insights. It seems clear that traditional local entertainment faces a severe crisis, largely replaced by gambling or passive consumption. While the reasons are complex, involving modernization, economic pressures, and changing lifestyles, there's a consensus on the need for constructive alternatives. Suggestions include selectively reviving and adapting valuable traditional forms like *nongak*, folk songs, or mask dances; promoting modern media like radio and movies in more active, communal ways; encouraging new creative activities like simple dramas or storytelling; promoting sports and reading; and fostering existing positive local activities. Implementing these requires conscious effort, resources, and support from both within and outside the communities. This is indeed a significant challenge for the future of local culture. We hope this discussion serves as a small step towards addressing this important issue.

**Summary**

This 1938 roundtable discussion addresses the decline of traditional Korean local entertainment (향토오락). Participants Kim Munjip, Kim Sangyong, Pak T'aewŏn, and Yu Chino, moderated by the magazine's editor, concur that forms like *nongak*, mask dances, *p'ansori*, and folk songs have largely vanished from rural life. They attribute this decline to the influx of modern civilization, economic hardship limiting leisure time, possible suppression by authorities, and fundamental changes in lifestyle and worldview. The void left by traditional entertainment is being filled primarily by gambling (like flower card games) and passive consumption of modern media such as radio and records. The participants suggest constructive alternatives like selectively reviving valuable traditional arts, encouraging active community engagement with modern media, promoting reading and sports, and fostering simple, locally-driven creative activities, while acknowledging the difficulty of implementing these solutions.

For historians, this article offers valuable insight into the cultural anxieties and transformations occurring in rural Korea during the late 1930s under Japanese rule. It reflects intellectuals' concerns about the erosion of traditional culture, the perceived lack of "healthy" entertainment for the masses, and the social problems associated with gambling. The discussion highlights the complex interplay between tradition and modernity, economic conditions, and cultural policy (implied through mentions of potential suppression and the need for guidance) in shaping everyday life during the colonial period. It also reveals contemporary perspectives on what constituted valuable cultural forms versus "degenerative" activities.
