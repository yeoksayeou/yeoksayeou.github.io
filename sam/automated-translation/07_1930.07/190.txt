Prospects for Korean Rural Village Promotion

By Sekihara Kiyoshi, Head of the Agriculture Section, Government-General of Korea Agriculture and Forestry Bureau

Looking back, the Korean Rural Village Promotion Movement (朝鮮農村振興運動) originated in Shōwa 7 [1932] and has since steadily expanded and strengthened, achieving remarkable results year by year. Having passed through the stages of dissemination and education, it has now entered the crucial stage of practical implementation. Especially since Shōwa 13 [1938], the promotion of establishing and implementing "Farm Household Economic Revitalization Plans" (農家經濟更生計畫), tailored to the specific circumstances of each village (部落), has been strongly encouraged as a central focus. Consequently, by the end of March this year [1940], plans had been established in approximately 15,000 villages, covering about 1,050,000 households, representing roughly 50% of the total farm households on the peninsula (半島).

Furthermore, with the expansion and intensification of the current situation [wartime], the importance of rural village promotion has increasingly been recognized. Various promotion policies have been established, and remarkable activities are unfolding across the peninsula. Now, based on the results achieved so far, and in light of the current situation, I wish to discuss the future prospects of this movement.

The Farm Household Economic Revitalization Plan, which is the core of the current Rural Village Promotion Movement, is essentially a concrete action plan for farm household management established by the farmers themselves. Its primary characteristic lies in the voluntary participation of the farmers. While based on the principle of self-help and revitalization through the farmers' own power, the plans are formulated under the guidance of the authorities, ensuring they are appropriate, rational, and integrated with various national policies. Specifically, guidance is provided to ensure these plans align with policies such as the Plan for Increased Production of Staple Foods (主要食糧增産計畫), the Seven-Year Plan for Increasing Northern Cotton and Wool Production (北鮮綿羊増殖七箇年計畫), the Plan for Expanding Raw Cotton Production (棉花増産擴充計畫), and the Plan for Securing Military Horses (軍馬資源涵養計畫). The goal is for each farm household to eliminate debt within roughly five years, achieve self-sufficiency in staple foods, accumulate assets for reproduction, and ultimately establish a self-reliant and stable economic foundation.

The process for establishing these plans involves, first, the selection of villages deemed suitable for implementing revitalization plans by the county chief (郡守) or island governor (島司). Then, under the guidance of officials from the county/island, police station (警察署), financial association (金融組合), agricultural association (農會), irrigation association (水利組合), and other related administrative bodies, the village head (部落長), promotion committee members (振興委員), and representatives of the farmers collaborate to investigate the actual conditions of the village and draft a plan tailored to its specific circumstances. This draft is then reviewed and finalized by the "Village Revitalization Plan Deliberation Committee" (部落更生計畫審議會), composed of the aforementioned guiding officials.

Once a plan is established for a village, each constituent farm household formulates its own individual revitalization plan based on the village plan, again receiving guidance from the authorities. The implementation of these established plans is then carried out through the farmers' own voluntary efforts and practices. However, guidance and supervision are provided by the authorities as needed. The prefectural governor (府尹), county chief, island governor, police chief (警察署長), and heads of relevant local agencies form a guidance structure, collaborating closely to oversee the plan's execution.

Furthermore, within the village, a "Village Promotion Committee" (部落振興委員會) is established, comprising influential figures within the community. This committee plays a central role in promoting cooperation, harmony, and collective action among the villagers, facilitating the smooth implementation of the plan.

Crucially, the foundation of this movement lies in spiritual revitalization. Fostering the spirit of diligence, self-help, autonomy, and cooperation among farmers is paramount. Therefore, alongside the economic revitalization plan, strong emphasis is placed on spiritual cultivation and lifestyle improvement (生活改善). Various lectures, workshops, and model examples are utilized to instill these values. Model villages (模範部落) are designated to serve as benchmarks, and their successes are widely publicized to encourage emulation by other villages.

Regarding the financial aspects necessary for implementing the revitalization plans, the primary focus is on eliminating existing farm household debt (農家負債). Efforts are made to organize and consolidate these debts. For necessary revitalization funds (更生資金), measures are taken to provide long-term, low-interest loans through financial associations and the Oriental Development Company (東洋拓殖株式會社).

As discussed above, the Rural Village Promotion Movement, centered on the Farm Household Economic Revitalization Plan, has achieved significant results and is expected to play an increasingly vital role, especially under the current wartime situation (時局下). Strengthening the home front structure (銃後體制強化) is an urgent task for the peninsula today, and stabilizing and improving the livelihoods of farmers, who constitute the majority of the population, is a prerequisite for achieving this.

Moreover, securing food supplies is fundamental to national defense (國防). Ensuring self-sufficiency in food for the peninsula's population and increasing production to contribute to the empire's food supply are critical missions assigned to Korean agriculture (朝鮮農業). The successful execution of the Rural Village Promotion Movement is directly linked to fulfilling these missions.

Therefore, the Rural Village Promotion Movement is not merely about the economic well-being of individual farmers; it is intrinsically connected to strengthening the national structure and holds immense significance for the construction of the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere (東亞協同體). It is believed that through the concerted efforts of the government and the people (官民一體), this movement will steadily advance, bearing fruit in the establishment of bright farming villages (明朗農村) across the peninsula, thereby contributing significantly to the nation.

**Summary**

This 1940 article by Sekihara Kiyoshi, a Japanese official in the Government-General of Korea's Agriculture Bureau, outlines the progress and future prospects of the Korean Rural Village Promotion Movement (朝鮮農村振興運動). Initiated in 1932, the movement shifted focus in 1938 to implementing "Farm Household Economic Revitalization Plans" (農家經濟更生計畫) in villages across Korea. These plans, emphasizing voluntary farmer participation but guided by Japanese authorities, aimed to eliminate debt, increase agricultural production (aligned with Japanese wartime needs like cotton and food), foster self-sufficiency, and instill values like diligence and cooperation within about five years. The article highlights the integration of these plans with broader Japanese imperial goals, such as strengthening the home front (銃後體制強化) and contributing to the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere (東亞協同體).

From a historical perspective, the article is revealing in its depiction of Japanese colonial policy in rural Korea during wartime. It showcases the dual nature of the promotion movement: presented as a benevolent effort towards farmer self-help and modernization ("bright farming villages"), while simultaneously serving clear imperial objectives of resource extraction (food, cotton, wool), social control (spiritual cultivation, lifestyle improvement), and mobilization for the war effort. Historians might find the emphasis on "voluntary" participation under authoritative "guidance," the detailed structure of control involving various officials (county chiefs, police), and the explicit linking of rural development to Japan's geopolitical ambitions particularly illustrative of the mechanisms and ideology of Japanese colonialism in its later stages.
