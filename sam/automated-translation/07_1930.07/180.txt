**Summary**

This document outlines the Government-General of Korea's plan to standardize housing construction specifications for smaller wooden residences (under 50 *tsubo*) starting October 1, 1938. The stated goals are to rationalize construction, reduce costs, regulate materials, and improve living standards to support national stability and strength, aligning with wartime national policy. The plan involves setting standards for materials and methods, guiding and encouraging standardized construction, regulating materials, providing financing, simplifying permits, and offering technical guidance. For historians, this document reveals the colonial administration's increasing intervention in everyday life and the economy under the pretext of modernization and wartime mobilization. It demonstrates a top-down approach to reshaping Korean living spaces and controlling resources, reflecting broader trends of assimilation and resource management in the late 1930s colonial context.
