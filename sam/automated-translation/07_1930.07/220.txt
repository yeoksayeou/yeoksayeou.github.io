**I. Where and How Many Reside**

It is truly difficult to provide an accurate number for our compatriots residing in China (支那), excluding Manchuria (満洲). There are no precise statistics available, and even if there were, the numbers fluctuate significantly day by day, making accuracy impossible. Consequently, estimates vary greatly depending on the source. The figure could be as low as one hundred thousand or as high as three hundred thousand. If we include Manchuria, the total number of our compatriots overseas reaches approximately two million, representing about one-tenth of the entire Korean population. Thus, the lives and activities of these overseas compatriots constitute a significant issue for the development of our Korean people. This article aims to provide a general overview (概況) of the situation of our compatriots residing in China proper, specifically excluding Manchuria.

Although there are no accurate statistics, it is generally estimated that around two hundred thousand Koreans reside in various parts of China. They are most concentrated in North China (北支), particularly in cities like Peking (北京) and Tientsin (天津), and across Hopeh (河北) and Shantung (山東) provinces. Significant numbers are also found in Shanghai (上海) and other cities along the coast and the Yangtze River (揚子江), as well as in various inland locations. However, the largest population is undoubtedly concentrated in North China. This region serves as a gateway from Korea (朝鮮) and Manchuria, and due to its proximity and historical ties, it naturally attracts the largest number of Korean residents.

**II. Types of Occupations and Living Standards**

What kind of work do these compatriots engage in? Their occupations vary widely depending on the region. Generally, a large portion are involved in agriculture, especially in North China and Shantung Province. Others work as laborers, small-scale merchants, brokers, innkeepers, restaurant owners, cafe proprietors, and bar hostesses. There are also students, company employees, government officials, doctors, journalists, religious figures, and educators, among others. However, individuals in these latter, more specialized professions are relatively few. The vast majority are engaged in agriculture, manual labor, or small businesses.

Regarding their living standards, it is generally quite poor (貧弱). Most live hand-to-mouth. Especially those engaged in agriculture in rural areas of North China and Shantung often face extreme hardship (苦痛). Farming conditions in China are harsh, and they frequently suffer from natural disasters like floods and droughts, as well as exploitation by landlords and officials, and threats from bandits. Many drift from place to place, unable to settle down. While those in cities like Peking, Tientsin, and Shanghai fare slightly better, most are still trapped in poverty. Small merchants lack capital, laborers face unemployment, and even those running eateries or inns struggle with intense competition. There are, of course, a few successful individuals, but they are exceptions. The overall living condition of Koreans in China is one of hardship and instability.

**III. Education and Cultural Life**

The educational situation for Koreans in China is extremely poor. There are very few dedicated educational facilities (施設) for Korean children. While some missionary schools or schools established by Korean organizations exist in major cities like Peking, Tientsin, and Shanghai, they are insufficient to accommodate the needs. Most children grow up without proper schooling. Illiteracy rates are high, and there is a general lack of knowledge and cultural awareness. This ignorance (無智) and lack of understanding (無理解) contribute to their difficulties in adapting to local society and improving their livelihoods.

Cultural life is similarly underdeveloped. Community organizations exist in some cities, but they often lack unity and financial resources. Newspapers or magazines published for Koreans are few and struggle to survive. Social gatherings or cultural events are infrequent. Many Koreans live isolated lives, detached from both Korean traditions and Chinese society. This lack of cultural connection and community support exacerbates their sense of alienation and hardship.

**IV. Problems and Future Prospects**

The major problems facing Koreans in China are poverty, lack of education, poor sanitation, disunity, and discrimination. Poverty prevents them from improving their living conditions or providing education for their children. Lack of education hinders their ability to secure better jobs or participate effectively in society. Poor sanitation leads to health problems. Disunity among Koreans themselves weakens their ability to advocate for their collective interests. Furthermore, they often face prejudice and discrimination from the local Chinese population, as well as difficulties arising from their ambiguous legal status.

Addressing these issues requires concerted effort from multiple fronts. There is a need for better support systems, including educational facilities, financial aid, and community centers. Promoting unity and cooperation among Koreans is crucial. Additionally, diplomatic efforts are needed to improve their legal standing and protect their rights. The future prospects for Koreans in China depend heavily on whether these challenges can be effectively tackled. Without significant improvements in their living conditions, education, and social integration, their struggles are likely to continue. The circumstances of our compatriots in China warrant serious attention and concern from both the homeland (内地) and the relevant authorities like the Government-General (総督府). Their situation is a special (特殊) one, demanding understanding and appropriate measures. The severity (甚) of their plight should not be underestimated.

**Summary**

This 1937 article by Yi Kaktchong describes the challenging living conditions of approximately 200,000 Koreans residing in China proper (excluding Manchuria), primarily concentrated in North China (Peking, Tientsin, Hopeh, Shantung). The author details their diverse but largely low-status occupations (farming, labor, small business), widespread poverty exacerbated by natural disasters and exploitation, extremely limited educational opportunities leading to high illiteracy, and underdeveloped cultural life marked by disunity and isolation. Key problems identified include poverty, lack of education, poor sanitation, internal disunity, and discrimination, requiring urgent attention and support systems. From a historical perspective, the article is significant as it provides a contemporary Korean viewpoint (published in a Japanese-controlled colonial era magazine) on the struggles of the Korean diaspora in China just before the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War. It highlights the socio-economic hardships, lack of infrastructure for diasporic communities, and the complex position of Koreans under Japanese colonial rule, caught between their homeland and host country, a situation requiring "special" attention from authorities like the Government-General. Historians might find the portrayal of Korean disunity and the call for intervention from colonial authorities particularly revealing of the period's complexities.
