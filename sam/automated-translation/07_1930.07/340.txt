My heart feels swollen, as if filled with hope. How can one explain this feeling? No matter how insignificant (微微) a nation (民族) may be, surely there must be places built up with its own blood and sweat (피땀). However, for those looking towards the future (압흘), Hŭngnam was merely a place that evoked interest (興味) and sensation (感覺). But having seen Hŭngnam three times – in Shōwa 8 (1933), 9 (1934), and now 11 (1936) – my impressions (感想) have quite changed. This doesn't mean my initial thrill (感激) has cooled (식엇다는). Rather, on top of that thrill, I have come to possess a new kind of mystical feeling (神秘感), akin to awe (畏敬).

Indeed (卽), I have heard much praise (讚辭) for Mr. Noguchi Shitagau (野口遵), the master (主人) and meritorious figure (功勞者) behind the construction of Hŭngnam (興南建設). Truly (果然), without some kind of genius-like wisdom (智慧), courageous decision-making (勇斷), and driving force (迫力), one cannot imagine that the foremost base (根據地) for the chemical industry (化學工業) in East Asia (東洋) would have emerged today. However, on the other hand (또한편), one can also ask: when he brought the technology (技術), capital (資本), passion (熱), and sincerity (誠意) he possessed, was Hŭngnam truly a land with the fitting destiny (因緣) and qualification (資格)? In other words (다시 말하면), what geographical relationships (地理的 關係) did Hŭngnam possess that drew Mr. Noguchi here, across ten thousand *ri* (萬里) to these green mountains (靑山)?

Many people say that Mr. Noguchi's choice (擇) of Hŭngnam was merely due to a chance discovery (偶然 發見). They say that sometime (언젠가), while returning from inspecting (視察) a mine (鑛山) in Ŭllyul (殷栗), Hwanghae Province (黃海道), he had abandoned (抛棄) his plan (計劃) to generate electricity (電氣) using the hydraulic power (水力) of the Yesŏnggang River (禮成江) and was disheartened (落心). Just then (마츰), he heard a report (報告) from an official (官吏) of the Government-General (總督府) who had explored (探險) the Hŏch'ŏn'gang (虛川江) and Pujŏn'gang (赴戰江) rivers. Suddenly (문득), ambition (野心) stirred (動) within him, and the result (結果) of his subsequent survey (踏査) was the construction (建設) of a large factory (大工場) utilizing the hydroelectric power (水力電氣) of the Pujŏn'gang. If this idea had not occurred (떠오르지 안햇스면) in his mind (腦裏), Hŭngnam today would have remained nothing more than a single (一個), tiny fishing village (漁村). Therefore, they say the key to the success (成功) of Mr. Noguchi, who made this succeed, lies in coincidence (偶然性).

But why necessarily (하필이면) the Hŏch'ŏn'gang and Pujŏn'gang? If the suitable site (適地) for a hydroelectric power plant (水力發電所) had been some remote (외따른) island or deep in the mountains (山中), would a Hŭngnam like today's have arisen (생겨 낫겟슴닛가)? A large-scale industry (大規模 工業) capable of utilizing such power generation would have to follow. However, the fact that, due to the geographical circumstances (地理的 關係上) within Korea (朝鮮), there was no other place like Hŭngnam for establishing a chemical industry using hydroelectricity will be the crucial key. Hŭngnam, as a good harbor (良港) on the East Sea (東海), has abundant marine products (海産物). Its hinterland (背後地) possesses abundant agricultural (農産物), forest (林産物), marine (水産物), and underground resources (地下資源). With convenient transportation (交通), it is convenient for gathering the goods (物資) from its hinterland and also convenient for shipping them out to other places (他處), possessing a natural (天然) good harbor. Seen this way (이러케 보면), Hŭngnam was waiting for Mr. Noguchi, and Mr. Noguchi found (차즌것이라) Hŭngnam. In short (要컨대), while there might have been an element of chance (偶然性) in Mr. Noguchi's success, of course (勿論), it should be seen that inevitability (必然性) played a larger role.

Owing to this connection (因緣), Hŭngnam and Mr. Noguchi joined hands, and over the following ten, no, twelve or thirteen years (十二三年동안), Hŭngnam has truly (實로) undergone astonishing (驚異的) development (發展). The Chōsen Chisso Hiryō Kabushiki Kaisha (朝鮮窒素肥料株式會社), which initially started (始作) with a capital (資本金) of fifty or sixty thousand Yen (五六萬圓), has today swelled (불어 낫고) to the enormous sum (巨額) of 85 million Yen (八千五百萬圓) in capital. Encompassing (包括) the vast area (廣大 地帶) covering Pujŏn-gun (赴戰郡) and Sinhŭng-gun (新興郡) in Hamgyŏngnam-do (咸南), there are four power plants (發電所 四個處) with a total generation capacity (總發電高) of 325,000 kilowatts (三十二萬五千키로왓트). On the Hŭngnam pier (興南埠頭), nitrogen (窒素工場) and ammonium sulfate plants (硫安工場) have been constructed (建設), currently (現在) producing (生産) 500,000 tons (五十萬톤) of fertilizer (肥料) annually (年間), valued at approximately (約) 55 million Yen (五千五百萬圓). Derived (派生) from these are sulfuric acid plants (硫酸工場), nitric acid plants (硝酸工場), hardened oil plants (硬化油工場), catalyst manufacturing plants (觸媒製作所), and various kinds (各種) of workshops (工作工場) lined up. If you add the carbide (카바이트) plant currently under construction (建設中) and the newly established (新設) Hŭngnam Refinery (興南製鍊所), the total number (總數) of employees (從業員) reaches 13,000 (萬三千名), and the population (人口) of Hŭngnam-ŭp (興南邑) has reached 45,000 (四萬五千名), transforming it into a major city (一大都市) of Northern Korea (北朝鮮).

What are the future ambitions (將來 抱負) of Hŭngnam, which has developed so rapidly (勇躍的)?

**Summary**

This 1936 article by Yi Kwangsu describes the phenomenal industrial development of Hŭngnam, focusing on the massive chemical complex established by Noguchi Shitagau's Chōsen Chisso Hiryō Kabushiki Kaisha. Yi reflects on his changing impressions of the city over three visits, moving from simple interest to a sense of awe mixed with mystery. He debates whether Noguchi's success was pure chance (discovering the hydroelectric potential of the Pujŏn'gang after abandoning plans elsewhere) or inevitable destiny, arguing that Hŭngnam's geographical advantages (good harbor, resource-rich hinterland, suitable location for large-scale hydroelectric-powered chemical industry) made it uniquely qualified. The article details the enormous growth in capital, power generation, fertilizer production, related industries, and population, transforming Hŭngnam from a small fishing village into a major industrial center in northern Korea. From a historical perspective, the article is revealing as it showcases a prominent Korean intellectual, Yi Kwangsu, praising Japanese-led industrialization in colonial Korea, framing it almost mystically as a destined partnership between Japanese capital/technology (Noguchi) and Korean geography (Hŭngnam). Historians might find Yi's perspective, the detailed statistics on the scale of the Chisso enterprise, and the justification of development (balancing chance vs. inevitability/geographical destiny) particularly interesting for understanding colonial narratives of modernization and collaboration.
