(Editorial Department Reporter) The year Shōwa 11 (1936) has passed, and the new year Shōwa 12 (1937) has arrived. Looking back at the past year, Shōwa 11, what kind of year was it for the ideological and literary circles (思想文藝界) of Chosŏn? And what kind of prospects can we hope for in the new year, Shōwa 12? On this occasion, as we send off the old year and greet the new, we have invited several critics who are active on the front lines of the literary world to freely share their thoughts in this roundtable discussion. We hope this will serve as a reference for readers interested in the ideological and literary circles. We ask each of you to first look back at the past year, Shōwa 11, and share your general overview. Let's start with Mr. Paek Ch'ŏl.

Paek Ch'ŏl: Generally speaking about last year, Shōwa 11, what comes to mind first is that there were remarkably few works compared to previous years. It feels like it was a year of poor harvest in terms of literary works. Both full-length novels and short stories were scarce. This is just my general impression. Looking at the writers, there were hardly any new figures who emerged. Compared to Shōwa 10 (1935), there was very little activity from new writers last year. Among established writers, some individuals showed outstanding activity, but overall, the literary world felt stagnant.

Pak Yŏnghŭi: I generally agree with Mr. Paek's assessment. It seems last year was indeed a year of poor harvest. When we look back at the year, what should we consider? Should we look at the works produced, the activities of the writers, or the overall trends? If we talk about works, there really weren't many. For full-length novels, I can't think of any particular work that stands out from last year. There were some attempts, but nothing truly representative. As for short stories, while there might have been some good ones individually, overall, the quantity was small. If we consider the writers, as Mr. Paek mentioned, there were no notable new writers. Among the existing writers, Yi Hyosŏk (李孝石) and Kim Tongni (金東里) were perhaps the most active, but even their activity doesn't seem particularly outstanding compared to previous years. So, from the perspective of works and writers, last year was quite barren. However, if we look at the overall trend or atmosphere, there might be something to note.

Pak Nogap: My feeling is also that last year was generally inactive. Regarding the scarcity of works Mr. Paek and Mr. Pak mentioned, I wonder if it's related to the circumstances of the publishers or magazines. Weren't there fewer venues for publication? Also, perhaps the writers themselves were experiencing a period of introspection or transition? When looking back, it's easy to focus on the lack of output, but perhaps there were underlying shifts or preparations happening. For example, there seemed to be more theoretical discussions or debates, even if they didn't immediately lead to creative works.

Pak Ch'unsŏ: I also felt the stagnation last year. It seems the suppression (壓迫) from the authorities became stronger, making it difficult for writers to freely express themselves, especially regarding social or ideological issues. This might have contributed to the self-censorship or silence among writers. The topics became narrower, often focusing on personal experiences, nature, or aesthetics, avoiding direct engagement with social realities. This inevitably leads to a sense of limitation or lack of vitality in the literature produced.

Kim Namch'ŏn: Adding to what everyone has said, while the quantity might have been low, I think we should also look at the quality or the direction of the few works that did appear. Perhaps there was a deepening of psychological portrayal or experimentation with form, even within the constrained environment. I recall some works attempting new stylistic approaches. Also, the discussions around 'pure literature' (純粹文學) versus 'engaged literature' continued, although perhaps in a more subdued manner than before. The question of what literature can and should do under the current circumstances (時局) was an undercurrent. Looking back, Shōwa 11 might be seen as a year of internal searching and enduring hardship for the literary world, rather than outward achievement. What specific characteristics did you notice in the works that were published, Mr. Paek?

Paek Ch'ŏl: As Mr. Pak Ch'unsŏ pointed out, there was a tendency to retreat into aestheticism or personal concerns. Some writers focused intensely on refining their style and exploring the beauty of the Korean language, which is valuable in itself. However, this often came at the expense of broader social relevance. There was also a sense of weariness or resignation in some works. But it wasn't entirely uniform; as Mr. Kim suggested, some writers, like perhaps Yi T'aejun (李泰俊) or Pak T'aewŏn (朴泰遠), continued their stylistic experiments, capturing the atmosphere of Kyŏngsŏng (京城) or delving into the inner lives of intellectuals, albeit within limits. <122> The lack of major, impactful works does stand out, though.

Pak Yŏnghŭi: Regarding the prospects for the new year, Shōwa 12 (1937), it's difficult to be optimistic given the trends of last year and the overall situation. Unless there's a significant change in the external environment, the constraints are likely to continue. However, writers are resilient. Perhaps the period of introspection will lead to new breakthroughs. We might see writers finding subtle ways to engage with reality, or perhaps a further deepening of artistic technique. The emergence of a truly powerful new voice would be welcome, but based on last year, it seems unlikely in the immediate future. Continued efforts in translation and introduction of foreign literature might also play a role in stimulating new ideas.

**Summary**

This roundtable discussion among Korean literary critics Paek Ch'ŏl, Pak Yŏnghŭi, Pak Nogap, Pak Ch'unsŏ, and Kim Namch'ŏn reflects on the state of Korean literature and ideology in 1936 (Shōwa 11) and looks ahead to 1937 (Shōwa 12). The participants generally agree that 1936 was a year of "poor harvest" with few significant literary works, especially full-length novels, and a lack of notable new writers. They attribute this stagnation to various factors, including increased censorship and suppression by Japanese authorities, a resulting tendency for writers to retreat into aestheticism or personal themes, potential difficulties with publishing venues, and possibly a period of internal searching or transition among writers themselves. While acknowledging some stylistic experimentation and the activity of certain established writers like Yi Hyosŏk and Kim Tongni, the overall assessment is one of limited vitality. Prospects for 1937 are viewed with caution, acknowledging the ongoing constraints but holding out hope for resilience and potential new developments born from the period of introspection.

From the perspective of colonial history, this article is revealing about the chilling effect of Japanese colonial censorship on Korean cultural production in the mid-1930s. The critics' explicit mention of "suppression (壓迫)" and the resulting retreat from social engagement towards "pure literature" or personal themes underscores the difficult environment writers operated in. Historians can glean insights into the strategies of cultural survival and the internal debates within the Korean literary field under duress, as well as the specific writers and perceived trends of that year.
