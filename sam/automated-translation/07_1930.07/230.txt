**Body Text Translation**
The path of our national liberation movement is indeed arduous and long. Reflecting on the past decade since the March First Movement, while the spirit of independence has permeated the entire nation, the concrete methods and strategies for achieving this goal still require deep consideration and unified action.

Some advocate focusing solely on the cultivation of strength (實力養成), arguing that only through advancements in education, industry, and culture can we build the foundation necessary for eventual independence. They believe that direct confrontation without sufficient preparation is reckless and counterproductive. This perspective emphasizes patience, gradualism, and internal development as the primary means.

Others, however, champion a more direct and active approach. They contend that relying solely on gradual self-strengthening under the oppressive conditions of colonial rule is naive. They argue that political struggle, raising international awareness, and mobilizing the masses for direct action, even if risky, are essential to challenge the colonial structure directly and hasten the arrival of liberation. Waiting passively for strength to accumulate, they fear, might mean waiting indefinitely while the national spirit erodes.

Ultimately, a dogmatic adherence to either extreme seems insufficient. The methodology of national liberation must be multifaceted. While the steady cultivation of national capabilities in all spheres – education, economy, culture – is undeniably crucial for long-term sustenance and future nation-building, we cannot neglect the political dimension. A flexible strategy is required, one that combines internal capacity building with astute political engagement and the mobilization of national consciousness, adapting tactics according to the changing domestic and international circumstances. The spirit of March First must guide us, but its methods must evolve with the times. We must seek a path that harmonizes inner strength with outward struggle.

**Summary**

This essay by An Chaehong discusses the ongoing debate regarding the best methods for achieving Korean national liberation from Japanese colonial rule. He contrasts the "cultivation of strength" (gradualist, focusing on internal development) approach with more direct political action and mobilization strategies. An concludes that neither extreme is sufficient alone, advocating for a multifaceted approach that combines internal capacity building with political struggle, adapting flexibly to circumstances. For historians, the article is significant as it reflects the internal strategic debates within the Korean nationalist movement during the colonial period, particularly the tension between cultural nationalism/gradualism and more activist approaches in the decade following the March First Movement. It highlights the considerations of prominent intellectuals like An Chaehong in navigating the path towards independence under severe colonial constraints.
