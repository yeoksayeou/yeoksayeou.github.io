Book Review: Reading Yun Sŏkchung's "Shoulder to Shoulder"
						By Pak Kyeju

It has already been 15 years since Mr. Yun Sŏkchung, the "uncle" of our paradise of childlike innocence, became the shoulder-to-shoulder companion of Chosŏn's children. We, along with all of you young boys and girls of Chosŏn, are immensely delighted as he now offers his fourth gift, the newly compiled children's song collection, "Shoulder to Shoulder."

Regarding the content, these are already well-regarded children's songs. Sŏktong (Yun Sŏkchung) receives perfect esteem for his grasp and portrayal of the child's mind. My brush merely hesitates now, fearing that reviewing his children's songs again might actually diminish their value.

Each and every piece is like handling jewels; the more one reads, even adults fall into the world of childhood innocence, becoming an elixir plant (不老草) that keeps one from aging. Considering even the bookbinding, where else could such meticulous, clear, beautiful, elegant, and simple skill be found? I confidently state that this one-volume book (1卷 書) will capably become your shoulder-to-shoulder companion, never leaving your side.

Those who are fathers, those who are mothers, those who are uncles, those who are older sisters – if you truly love your sons, nephews, and younger siblings, you must present this "Shoulder to Shoulder" to your children (子弟).

**Summary**

This article is a highly laudatory book review by Pak Kyeju of Yun Sŏkchung's fourth collection of children's songs, "Ŏkkaedongmu" (Shoulder to Shoulder), published in 1940. The reviewer praises Yun Sŏkchung's established reputation, his deep understanding of children's minds, the quality of the poems likening them to jewels and an elixir of youth, and the book's beautiful design. He strongly recommends the book as an essential gift for children. For historians, the article highlights the continued development and appreciation of Korean children's literature even during the late colonial period. It underscores Yun Sŏkchung's significant role as a beloved children's author ("uncle") and reflects contemporary aesthetic values in book publishing (praise for binding and design). The promotion of a Korean-language children's book signifies a space where Korean cultural identity, particularly concerning childhood, was still being nurtured despite assimilation pressures.

뿍·레뷰, 尹石重著 『어깨동무』를 읽고
						朴啓周
우리 童心 낙원의 아저씨 尹石重씨가 朝鮮 어린이의 어깨동무가 되어준 지 이미 15년. 이제 네 번째의 선물로서 동요집 『어깨동무』를 새로 꾸며서 朝鮮 소년소녀 여러분 앞에 이바지함을 여러분과 함께 못내 즐겨합니다.
내용에 있어서는 이미 정평있는 동요. 童心 파악과 묘사에는 완벽의 이까림을 받는 石童. 이제 그의 동요를 다시 논평함이 되려 값을 떨어뜨릴까 怯나하매 내 붓이 머뭇거릴 뿐입니다.
篇篇마다 구슬을 다루는 듯, 읽을쑤록 어룬까지도 동심세계에 빠져서 늙지 않게 하는 不老草. 裝幀에 있어서까지 이처럼 알뜰하고 淸麗하고 雅淡한 솜씨가 또 어데 있었을까 생각하매, 이 1卷 書가 능히 여러분의 곁을 떠나지 않을 여러분의 어깨동무가 될 것을 장담합니다.
아버지되는 이, 어머니되는 이, 아저씨되는 이, 언니되는 이. 여러분은 모름즈기 여러분의 아들과 조카와 동생을 사랑할진댄 이 『어깨동무』를 여러분의 子弟에게 선사하시라.
