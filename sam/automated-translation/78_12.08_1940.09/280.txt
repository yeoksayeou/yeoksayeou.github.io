**Summary**

This article from the September 1940 issue of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine provides short updates on the activities and personal lives of various prominent Korean women, including writers, educators, professionals, and actresses. It covers career changes (journalism to education, joining broadcasting), travel (USA, Japan), personal milestones (births, recuperation from illness), misfortunes (house damage due to monsoon), and cultural activities (publishing manuscripts, film appearances, stage performances). For colonial history, the article offers glimpses into the lives of educated and professional women navigating careers and personal lives under Japanese rule. It highlights their engagement in modern fields like media (newspapers, radio, film), education, and the arts, their mobility (travel abroad and within Korea), and their participation in both traditional and emerging cultural forms, reflecting the social dynamics and cultural landscape of late colonial Korea. The mention of actresses moving between Korean and Japanese film industries (Mun Ye-bong to Shochiku) is particularly notable.
