**Company Announcement**

1.  Starting from the upcoming October issue, this magazine's page space will be greatly enlarged. All merely formal articles will be excluded, and it will instead be fully packed with important articles that will serve as models for wartime life (戰時生活) and new cultural life. Please look forward to it.

1.  We always intend to publish the next month's (翼月) issue by the 10th or 15th of the preceding month. However, there may be exceptions when the arrival of printing paper (入貨) is delayed due to transportation issues (운수관계).

1.  The various standalone books (單行本) previously announced by our company's publishing department (出版部) have been delayed beyond schedule due to difficulties in obtaining paper (用紙 入手難) during that time. However, starting this autumn (今秋), they will be published sequentially (順次). We hope for your continued cherished readership (愛讀).<20>

**Summary**

This announcement from the magazine *Samch'ŏlli* informs readers of upcoming changes. Starting with the October 1940 issue, the magazine will increase its page size and focus content entirely on "wartime life" and "new cultural life," eliminating superficial articles. It also addresses potential publication delays for the monthly issues due to difficulties in paper supply related to transportation. Finally, it assures readers that previously announced books from their publishing department, delayed by paper shortages, will begin sequential publication in the autumn. For historians, this notice starkly reflects the conditions of late colonial Korea under wartime mobilization. The explicit shift in content towards "wartime life," the acknowledged difficulties in obtaining basic supplies like paper due to transportation issues (likely strained by war efforts), and the delay in publishing activities all point to the increasing impact of the Sino-Japanese War (escalating towards the Pacific War) on civilian life and cultural production in Korea.
