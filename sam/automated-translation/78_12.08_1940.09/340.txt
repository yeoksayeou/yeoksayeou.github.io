From English Poetry
One
Picking flowers, weaving the leaves, I arrange a bouquet.
I arrange and send it, please wear it on your body.
I hope roots might sprout where it touches your skin.

Two
Why did you return the flower crown I gave you?
Though the flowers have withered and even the fragrance faded,
It is soaked in your skin's scent, please touch it to your lips.<192>

Newsreel (뉴쓰映畵)
One
Appearing brightly then rolling away,
History races upon the silent silver screen.
Though not a clown, how could one say it is not so?

Two
Tens of thousands gather, shouting without cease,
It is a triumphant day for heroes and great men.
History is like that film, turning without rest.

Three
Who was it that dreamt of tying up swords and aiming for the hoe?
When the military flag leads and the marching bugle sounds,
Why does a chill run down my spine and my chest feel tight?
-End-<193>
<192-193>

**Summary**

The document contains two short poems by Chu Yohan published in September 1940. The first, "From English Poetry," expresses longing and devotion through the imagery of offering flowers to a beloved, hinting at themes potentially adapted from Western love poetry. The second poem, "Newsreel," reflects on the fleeting, dramatic nature of history as depicted in newsreels, comparing historical figures to actors and history to an endlessly turning film. The final stanza starkly contrasts the dream of peace (swords for hoes) with the visceral, perhaps ambivalent, reaction to militaristic displays (flags, bugles), causing chills and a tight chest.

For historians, the poems, particularly "Newsreel," offer insight into the atmosphere of Korea in 1940 under Japanese rule during wartime mobilization. The second poem captures the public consumption of mediated historical narratives (newsreels) and reflects the tension between aspirations for peace and the overwhelming presence of militarism, potentially revealing the complex or conflicted feelings of intellectuals like Chu Yohan during this period. The visceral reaction described in the last stanza is particularly noteworthy.

꽃을 따서 잎을 역거 꽃다발을 겨릅네다
겨르어 보내오니 몸에 걸어 주시오서

꽃은 시들고 향긔조차 슬어졌으나
살 냄새 저졌아오니 입에 대여 주시소＜192＞
