						Sons of the Rising Sun·Korean Volunteer Soldiers·German Youth

Army Infantry Private First Class (Killed in Action Aug. 24, promoted to Corporal) Nishizawa Tokunaga (Niigata Prefecture)

Resolution
When I left my country, I enlisted with the resolve not to return alive. In the upcoming battle, as part of the honorable body-attack squad (肉攻班), I believe it is the duty of a soldier to destroy enemy tanks and die for the country in patriotic martyrdom.

Last Words
From the skies of a foreign land, I pray for the health of everyone in the village and all my family.
I too am healthy and participating in battle. Even if I die in battle, there is no need for any worry.

○
Army Infantry Superior Private Miyauchi Kōji (Niigata Prefecture)

Resolution
Devotion through desperate self-sacrifice.
The warrior's way esteems duty above mountains; Joining the body-attack squad, determined to die,
The fate of the battle rests on these shoulders; One life, lighter than a feather, glorious as a cherry blossom.

Last Words
I will gladly die for the Imperial Nation (皇國). I pray for the great fortune of my parents and siblings.

○
Army Infantry Private Third Class Ishida Hiroshi (Fukuoka Prefecture)

Resolution
How grateful I am to be able to serve as a soldier.
To be born a man and die for the Emperor (君) is truly glorious. Even if it is through fire or water, it is where a man lays down his life. How could there be any regrets? What is important is not to be defeated by others. <128>

Last Words
Father, please forgive this unfilial act of preceding my parent in death. This life is given for the sake of the nation and the Emperor. I wanted to stay by your side, Father, and work in various ways. From now on, I will work by Mother's side.
Father, please stay healthy forever. Please give my regards to Kawashinchi and Suetō as well.

○
Army Infantry Private First Class Tominaga Satoshi (Niigata Prefecture)

Resolution
My body is destined to die once; if I must die, let it be like a cherry blossom.
Now, I am resolved to bravely become a human bullet.

Last Words
Tell them I died shouting, "Long live His Majesty the Emperor!" (天皇陛下萬歲)
It has been one year and two months since Father passed away. I pray that Mother and all my siblings live happily. When Satoshi scatters like a flower of XX, please do not worry one bit, but rejoice, for it is for the nation. This I humbly request.

○
Army Infantry Private First Class Kameyama Naomichi (Niigata Prefecture)

Resolution
I keenly feel the grave responsibility of having become a soldier and being able to serve as a bulwark of the nation. I have always been resolved that dying on the front lines is the cherished desire of a soldier. Now is the time I am determined to throw myself into the work with all my might and dedicate myself to the Emperor and country. I willingly volunteer for the body-attack squad (肉攻班).

Last Words
If I am fortunate enough to die in battle on the front lines, please tell them that Kameyama died in good spirits.
Please convey my regards to those who took care of me before my enlistment. Please tell them that I prayed for the happiness of my parents and the whole family, and prayed for the health of the Company Commander and everyone else, and then died.

○
Army Infantry Private First Class Kobayashi Shin'ichi (Niigata Prefecture)

Resolution
The dawn of my fulfillment has arrived. Now is the time to die gladly! Now is the time to display the spirit of a man of divine Japan (神州)! I am resolved to volunteer at the very front.

Last Words
Shin'ichi will achieve a fine, unashamed death in battle. I pray for the great fortune of my parents and younger brother. <129>

○
Army Infantry Private Second Class Keya Genkun (Fukuoka Prefecture)

Resolution
If the close-quarters attack (肉迫攻擊) succeeds, I am resolved to complete the attack mission regardless of what happens to my body. Resolved to achieve a feat no less than that of the Three Brave Warriors.

Last Words
After I die, I entrust everything concerning my parents to you, older brother. As a soldier's duty, I am resolved to fight without being inferior to my brothers. I ask that the family be harmonious forever.

○
Army Infantry Private First Class (Killed in Action Aug. 24, promoted to Superior Private) Matsumoto Yasukichi (Prefecture omitted)

Resolution
I am resolved to fulfill the ultimate duty of a soldier by scattering as a flower defending the nation. I am content that others too are resolved to die. I definitely want to be chosen first.

Last Words
I rejoice in going to my death, scattering as a flower of the Imperial Nation (皇國). I have no lingering regrets. I consider this my final and sole service to the nation and to Mother. I pray for Mother's happiness after my death. Younger brother, younger sister, study hard and become fine individuals. And after my death, please believe that it was a splendid death in battle.
This text compiles the resolutions upon volunteering and the last words of members of the close-quarters attack squad belonging to the Ōiwa Unit during the battle in XX in August 1939. Every word and phrase is nothing but the heroic cry of our traditional spiritual strength and Yamato spirit (大和魂), moving final testaments. <130>

Korean Volunteer Soldiers

Respectfully, it has been some time since I last wrote. The barley has already ripened yellow, and the 120-degree [Fahrenheit?] high heat is very hot. Has everything been well with you since then? Thanks to your concern, we Privates have safely joined the XX unit in North China (北支) and are vigorously applying ourselves to military duties. Aware that this is the mission of the Peninsula (半島), we are resolved to fully display the vibrant spirit of the youth of the Korean Peninsula in North China, while following the orders of our superiors and wholeheartedly repaying our debt to the Emperor and country (君國) with single-minded devotion. Please, Colonel, Instructors, rest assured about everything. Isn't there a song?
"For the sake of our Lord (임군), for the world, what regret is there in offering this life?"
"Though our bodies differ, the resolve to die under the shining banner is all the same." (130)
It is my wish to die by enemy bullets as a Japanese soldier. Having set foot on the battlefield, how could I dream of returning home?
Colonel, I well remember your words at the farewell ceremony, your final instruction: "Die and come back." (omitted section) ...We are truly busy with guard duty and combat. Please understand. The weather is also very hot, so please take care of your health and further strengthen the home front (銃後).
Yi Chang-sŏk (From Paekku-myŏn, Kimje-gun, Chŏnbuk)
To Colonel Kaita

Respectfully, to Colonel Kaita, who is like a father who raised me, Instructors, and everyone, are you all well? When departing on this great mission, I caused much trouble in various ways. I consider it the highest honor that you came all the way to P'yŏngyang to see us off despite your busy schedule. Since our departure, both our minds and bodies have been robust. On XX day, we safely arrived at our destination and are advancing in our military duties with all our heart and strength. Please rest assured. We are resolved to devote the bodies and minds we have trained thus far, solely fulfill our duties as subjects of the Empire, and exert our utmost sincerity in loyal service to the nation (盡忠報國). We firmly believe this is how we can repay even one ten-thousandth of the grace we have received from the nation, society, and all of you, and follow the spirit of your teachings. We think that the happiness of the people of the Peninsula (半島民) will depend on our efforts. Thinking this way, we cannot help but feel our responsibility even more heavily. We intend to throw ourselves away to repay the vast and boundless Imperial grace (皇恩). Colonel, please rest assured. I will never forget the final encouragement you gave us at the Kyŏnghoe-ru Pavilion of the Government-General (總督府). We will definitely return as bones. (remainder omitted)
Kang Sŏk-chu (Born in Suwŏn, Kyŏnggi-do)

I respectfully write a few lines. To participate in this Holy War, aimed at establishing peace in East Asia under the great ideal of Hakkō Ichiu (八紘一宇), and to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with comrades from the Mainland (內地), sharing hardships and joys, is more joyous than anything. Through this, I deeply pledge to become an even more outstanding member of the Imperial Army (皇軍). What impressed me most this time was seeing Chinese boys waving the Japanese flag (日章旗) to send us off, and also how children were friendly to the Imperial Army, speaking a word or two of the national language (國語 - i.e., Japanese); it was both cute and touching. This entirely speaks to the popular sentiment turning away from the Chiang regime, and everyone was moved by the grace of the Imperial Army. (131) When I see the achievements of my seniors on the still vast front lines, I wonder if it is the work of gods, though done by humans. I am also taking full care of my hygiene and obeying military discipline well, so please rest assured.
Above is a brief report.
Respectfully, Song Pyŏng-ch'ŏn
To the Governor of Ch'ungch'ŏngbuk-to

Omitted beginning. Arrived safely at my post the day before yesterday, so please rest assured. Although it is still May here, the heat is like that of July or August back home. Drinking water is also quite scarce and hard to find anywhere; occasionally when found, drinking it unboiled can lead to cholera or typhus. Currently lodging within the garrison area. At night, enemies appear, and gunfire rings out bang, bang. But during the day, there are no incidents. Other volunteer soldiers have also been assigned to various units. Filled with vibrant energy, under the guidance of soldiers from the Mainland (內地), they are full of the spirit of sacrificing one's life for the country (一死報國). (remainder omitted)

German Soldiers from World War I
From the Notes of Siegfried Emmo Eulen
Born September 23, 1890, in Cloppenburg, Oldenburg. (Killed in Action)
—April 29, 1915
...Forward, ever forward, through heat, dust, dung, blood, and sweat—forward, lice, bedbugs, fleas, all jumbled together—forward! Rain falls constantly, sleepless through nights of biting cold, only hard bread and damp tobacco. Hot days continued from May 14th to the 20th, during which the battle raged, a great chorus of bullets raining down, shrapnel and canister shot hailing, roars and tremors. Thus we charged and constantly advanced. Our 91st Company fought particularly fiercely. Our unit has taken 1,300 enemy prisoners so far. On our side, we lost 6 officers out of 91, and 40 soldiers out of 300. Occasionally, murderous artillery fire fell upon our large group. I became completely cheerful. Why? Because once, a fragment of iron from an explosion zipped right past my ear, yet I only got a hole burned in my sleeve; another time, a clump of clay slammed into my left hip with a thud, but I was only lame for a moment; <132> and yet another time, the signalman right next to me took a direct hit, while I only had a tiny bit of my hair singed. And in other cases too, it always ended up just grazing my ears or limbs. It felt almost like being teased. Even the fire from strongly built enemy defensive positions consistently failed to hit squarely at the critical moment.
One shell killed the company commander's packhorse. The chestnut horse's head lay eyes closed, oats peeking out from between its teeth.

Eugen Ernst
Born August 24, 1896, in Berlin. (Killed in Action)

Diary
—February 12, 1916
All through the night of February 12th, and even as dawn approached, the rain continued ceaselessly. Today is the day of the Verdun attack. A considerable layer of rainwater has formed on the slopes, only increasing by the moment. The clock hands slowly indicated 8:00 AM. The tension among us and all other attack units mounted minute by minute. Around 8:00, the artillery preparations should have begun. However, the clock hands were already two or three minutes past eight. Still, the order to fire had not come. Finally, after waiting for an hour, we learned that the attack start had been postponed by 24 hours due to the misty rain. It was a tremendous disappointment after the nerve-wracking anticipation. Everyone used the unexpected 24 hours to further expand the ammunition storage holes.

Louis Mangold
Born October 19, 1887, in Eschwege. (Seriously Wounded)
—August 17, 1918
We have now entered the fifth year of the war by five or six days. How much longer will it take until our enemies desire peace?
I wish it would end soon somehow. However, just as patience is necessary in all things, in the case of war too, what everyone needs is this patience. We have no choice but to entrust everything to our politicians and commanders. This is my opinion.

**Summary**

This article from the September 1940 issue of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine compiles letters and final statements from soldiers. It includes sections featuring Japanese soldiers (mostly from Niigata and Fukuoka prefectures, some identified as killed in August 1939) expressing their resolve to die for the Emperor and nation, often as part of suicide attack squads; Korean volunteer soldiers serving in North China affirming their loyalty to the Japanese Empire and their mission; and translated excerpts from WWI German soldiers' diaries/letters describing battlefield conditions and sentiments. The collection aims to showcase patriotic fervor and sacrifice, aligning the Korean colonial subjects' participation with that of Japanese soldiers and framing it within a larger context of military duty, implicitly drawing parallels with Germany. For historians, the letters from Korean volunteers are particularly revealing, illustrating the complex reality of colonial subjects pressured or persuaded into serving the colonizer's military, articulating loyalty using the language of Japanese imperial ideology ("Emperor and country," "Imperial grace," "returning as bones"), even while referencing their Korean identity ("Peninsula," "Korean Peninsula youth"). The juxtaposition with Japanese and German soldiers' letters serves the propagandistic purpose of normalizing and glorifying sacrifice in the ongoing war effort.

朝鮮志願兵
謹啓 소식이 격조하였습니다. 벌써 보리도 누렇게 익고 120도의 高熱이 매우 덥습니다. 그 뒤에 별일은 없으신지요. 小生들은 염려해 주시는 덕택으로 무사히 北支 OO부대에 편입하여 원기왕성히 軍務에 힘을 쓰고 있습니다. 이것이 半島의 사명이란 것을 자각하고 北支에 있어서 朝鮮半島청년의 원기潑剌한 意氣를 유감없이 발휘하는 동시에 상관의 명령에 따라 一意專心 君國에 報할 각오입니다. 부디 大佐殿, 敎官各位殿 만사를 안심해 주십시요. 노래에도 있지 않습니까.
「임군을 위해서 세상을 然해서 바치는 목숨이 무엇이 아까울소냐」
「몸은 다르나 빛나는 기빨아래 죽으려는 마음은 다 一般」(130)
日本군인으로 敵彈에 죽는 것이 願입니다. 戰場에 발을 디려논 이상 고향에 돌아갈 것을 꿈꾸리까.
大佐殿, 壯行會를 마치고 최후의 訓示로써 「죽어 돌아오라」든 그 말씀 잘 기억하고 있습니다. (중략) 경비에 전투에 실로 바쁨니다. 下諒하시옵소서. 日氣도 매우 덥고한 데 부디 건강에 주의하셔서 더욱더 銃後를 굳게 직혀주시기 바랍니다.
李長錫 (全北 金堤郡 白鷗面 출신)
海田大佐 殿

謹啓 길러준 어버이신 海田大佐殿, 敎官殿, 一同諸氏 다-들 안령하십니까. 이번 大使命을 받들어 출정할 제는 여러가지로 폐를 많이 끼첬습니다. 바쁘신 중에 平壤까지 전송해 주신 것 無上의 榮光으로 생각합니다. 우리들은 출발 이래 심신이 함께 건장합니다. OO일엔 무사 목적지에 도착하여 전심전력으로 軍務에 매진하고 있습니다. 안심하여 주십시요. 지금까지 단련해 온 體國과 마음을 다 바처 오직 帝國국민으로써 본분을 다하고 盡忠報國의 赤誠을 다할 각오입니다. 이것이 곧 우리가 國家社會 及 여러분한태 받은 은혜를 만분의 1이래도 보답하는 것이며 교훈의 취지에 따르는 것이라고 확신합니다. 우리들 노력 여하에 따라 半島民의 행복을 좌우하게 되리라고 생각합니다. 그렇다고 생각하니 더 한층 책임을 무겁게 느끼지 않을 수 없습니다. 宏大無邊한 皇恩을 갑기 위해서 한몸을 던질 작정입니다. 大佐殿 安心해 주십시요. 總督府 慶會樓에서 말씀해주신 최후의 격려는 결코 잊지 않겠습니다. 반드시 뼈가 되어 돌아가겠습니다.(하략)

삼가 一筆 적겠아옵니다. 八紘一宇의 大理想 下에 東洋평화를 확립하려고 하는 이 聖戰에 참가하고 內地의 戰友와 比肩하여 손을 잡고 苦樂을 같이 하는 것은 무엇보다도 기뿌옵니다. 이 일로써 더욱더욱 훌륭한 皇軍의 일원이 되려고 깊이 誓念하옵나이다. 이번 自己가 가장 감복한 것은 支那소년이 日章旗를 두루며 踐送해주는 것과 또 아동들이 皇軍에게 친근하고 한마디 두마디 國語를 말하는 것은 귀엽고도 可憐하였습니다. 이것은 전혀 민심이 蔣정권으로부터 떠나는 것을 말하는 것이옵고, 모다 皇軍의 고마움을 감격하게(131)되었습니다. 아직 광대한 戰線에 있는 선배의 공적을 보오면 인간이면서 神業인가하고 생각하게 되읍니다. 自己도 십분 위생에 주의하고 善히 軍紀에 복종하고 있아오니 아모조록 안심하옵소서.
右 간단히 소식 알리옵나이다.

前略 도중 無恙히 再昨日 任地에 도착하였아오니 안심하십시오. 이곳은 아직 5월인데도 고국의 7,8월경의 더움과 같습니다. 음료수도 퍽 부자유하여 어디가도 구하기 어렵고 간혹 맞나도 냉수로 마시면 고레라나 지부스에 걸리는 것입니다. 지금은 域內에 숙박하고 있습니다. 밤중에는 적이 出沒하여 銃聲이 쾅쾅 울리군 합니다. 만은 낮에는 아무 일도 없습니다. 他 지원병도 各隊에 配屬되어 있습니다. 潑剌한 元氣에 타고 있으며 內地로부터 온 兵隊의 指導下에 一死報國의 念으로 갓득 찼습니다.(하략)

―一九一五年四月二十九日
……前進又前進、熱氣と、埃と、糞と、血と、汗とを潜つて前進-虱も南京虫も蚤も一緒くたに前進だ-絕えず雨が降つて、寒氣の酷烈な夜も眠らず、固いパンと濕つた煙草だけだ-暑い日は五月十四日から二十日までつゞき、その問戰鬪がつゞけられ、そこで彈丸の雨、榴彈や鐵筩彈の霰、轟音と震動との一大合唱だ。かくて突擊し絕えず前進した。吾が第九十一中隊は特に激しく鬪つた。吾が部隊は、これ迄に敵を捕虜とすること千三百に及んだ。味方の方は將校九十一から六、兵三百から四十を夫つた。時折り殺人的な砲火が吾々の大集團の上へ落下して來た。僕はすつかり愉快になつた。何故と云つて、ある時炸裂した鐵の破片は耳のすぐ上を走りすぎたが、僕自身袖の所が燃えて穴をあけられたきりだし、別の時は一塊の粘土がドシヤツと左の腰に當つたが、これとて一寸の問跛に＜132＞なつたばかりだし、又ある時僕のすぐ隣りにゐた通信兵は完全な命中彈を喰つたのに、僕は髮をホンの少々燒いたきりなのだ。それに、その他の場合でも、いつも耳や四肢を掠める程度ですんだ。まるで惡戯をされてゐるとか思へない位だ强固に構築された敵防禦陣地から繰り出す砲火も極つてアハヤと云ふ際どい所で適中しなかつた。
一發の榴彈が中隊長の荷馬を殺した。此の栗毛の首は、齒の間から燕麥をのぞかせ乍ら暝目してゐた。

日記
-一九一六年二月十二日
二月十二日の夜通し、それから黎明が迫つてもまだ雨は引つきりなしに降つてゐる。今日はヴエルダン攻擊の日である。ゲレンデの上には可なりの雨水の層が出來、それは刻々增すぱかりだ。時計の針がゆつくりと午前八時を示した。吾々及びその他總ての攻擊部隊の緊張は、一分から一分と盛り上つて來た。八時頃には砲兵隊の準備が始められねばならない。所で、時計の針は旣に八時を二三分過ぎてゐる。しかも、發砲命令は未だ來ない。最後に、一時間も待つてから初めて吾々は、攻擊開始が霧雨のために二十四時間延ばされた事を知つた。待ちに待つてゐた神經緊張のあとの、それは甚しい失望だつた。みんなは、二十四時間と云ふ不意にえた時間を、彈丸貯藏穴を更に擴げる事に利用した。

吾々はもう、戰爭第五年目に五六日踏み込みました。一體、吾々の敵が媾和を望むやうになるまでは、今後どの位かゝるのでせう。
何とか早く終りにしたいものです。とは云へ、何事にも忍耐と云ふことが必要なやうに、戰爭の場合にも誰も必要なことは此の忍耐です。私達は、萬事を吾が政治家と司令官に一任するより外はありません。これが私の意見です。
