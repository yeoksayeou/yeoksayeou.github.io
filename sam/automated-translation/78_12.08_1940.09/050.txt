**President Hitler's Income**
How much is President Hitler's income? Many are curious, with some saying he's a millionaire and others saying he works without pay. Amidst the uncertainty, the British *Daily Mail* newspaper, citing a reliable source in Berlin, reported that President Hitler's total annual income is 22,700 pounds. The breakdown is as follows:
President's salary 16,000 pounds
Entertainment expenses 17,000 pounds
Pocket money 3,000 pounds
Member of Parliament's annual stipend 6,000 pounds
Nazi Party Leader's salary 3,000 pounds
*Mein Kampf* royalties 134,000 pounds

**Tokyo's "Korean Culture Association"**
The "Korean Culture Association" (朝鮮文化의 會), formed in Tokyo by writers, painters, and film figures connected to Korea, reportedly held a welcoming banquet on August 1st for the "Child Student Composition Mission" (學童作文使節) that arrived from Seoul. The association's president is said to be Mr. Kikuchi Kan.

**"Japan-China Culture Association" in Nanjing**
The China-Japan Culture Association (中日文化協會), tasked with the mission of harmonizing Japanese and Chinese culture, was grandly established on July 28th at the East Asia Club (東亞俱樂部) in Nanjing, attended by Wang [Jingwei], head of the Executive Yuan, Ambassador Abe [Nobuyuki], and many other Japanese and Chinese officials. The association will reportedly appoint Messrs. Wang and Abe as honorary chairmen and undertake projects such as lectures on literature and academia, joint research, and exchanges of students and books. <32>

**The Gravestone of Teacher Kim Okkyun**
- Located in Tokyo's Aoyama Cemetery -

It was previously reported that a memorial service for Teacher Kim Okkyun was held in Tokyo on March 28th, honored by the reverent attendance of His Majesty King Yi. Many prominent figures, such as Mizuno Rentarō and Dr. Hayashi Kiryoku, attended at that time. Teacher Kim Okkyun's gravestone is currently in Tokyo's Aoyama Cemetery, and its inscription reads as follows:
(Front) Kim Okkyun. Courtesy Name: Paegwŏn. Pen Name: Kou, also Koyun. Clan Origin: Andong. Born on the 23rd day of the 1st lunar month of the Sinhae year, 460th year of the dynasty's founding [1851]. Passed the *munkwa* civil service examination in the Imsin year [1872]. Held successive posts up to Vice Minister of Personnel (吏曹參判). Assassinated in the Kapo year [1894]. Passed away at age 44.
(Side) Erected on the 28th day of the 3rd lunar month of the 8th year of Kwangmu of Great Han [1904].
(Back) Alas! Possessing extraordinary talent, encountering extraordinary times, without extraordinary achievements, suffering an extraordinary death. Was it Heaven's will to create Kim Kong [Kim Okkyun] thus? Magnanimous and brilliant, unconcerned with trivial matters; seeing good as one's own, chivalrous and tolerant of the masses—such was the Duke's nature. Prominent, high-spirited, standing alone and acting independently; unyielding despite a hundred setbacks, willing to forge ahead against thousands and tens of thousands—such was the Duke's spirit. To support the nation of the divine altar, to respect the rock-like stability [of the dynasty], to aid the royal ancestral shrine of the Yi dynasty, and to lay the foundation for eternal blessings—such was the Duke's self-appointed mission. When the Sino-Japanese War (日淸戰役) arose, people said his death served to provoke it. And the people of the nation gradually came to know the Duke's intentions, and all thought of rising up to carry them on. Though dead, his contribution to the country was great! The Duke's heir, Yŏngjin, intends to erect this stele to express his filial piety. Saying that he and the Duke shared a friendship of life and death, he requested me to compose this text. Unable to refuse due to lack of writing skill, I relay these tearful writings and humble words to later generations, to let them know that the Duke was an extraordinary person.
18th day of the 2nd lunar month, Kapchin year, 513th year of the founding of Great Chosŏn [1904].
Composed by Pak Yŏnghyo, Prince Consort Kŭmnŭng (錦陵尉), First Senior Rank.
Calligraphy by Yi Chun'yong, Second Junior Rank. <34>

**Summary**

This bulletin provides brief news items: details of Adolf Hitler's alleged annual income sources, the formation of a cultural association in Tokyo focused on Korea led by Japanese figures, the establishment of a Japan-China cultural association in Nanjing under Wang Jingwei and Japanese Ambassador Abe, and a detailed description of the reformist Kim Okkyun's gravestone and epitaph located in Tokyo's Aoyama Cemetery, noting a recent memorial service attended by the former Korean King Yi and prominent Japanese figures. For historians, the article offers insight into contemporary perceptions of Hitler in Asia, Japanese cultural diplomacy efforts in Korea and China during wartime, and particularly the complex way Kim Okkyun, a controversial figure in Korea-Japan relations, was being commemorated in Tokyo in 1940 with participation from both Japanese elites and the former Korean aristocracy, including the composer of the epitaph Pak Yŏnghyo and calligrapher Yi Chun'yong, revealing aspects of negotiated memory and elite interactions under colonialism.
