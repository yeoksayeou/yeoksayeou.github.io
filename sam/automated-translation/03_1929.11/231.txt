Company Announcement

● Samch'ŏlli (三千里), within your love, grows vigorously day by day, like bamboo shoots after rain, like chicks playing in a sunny spot. Therefore, although it is doubtful whether we will break through 20 million copies with a certain issue number, we know that the day will surely come when we comfortably exceed that figure in terms of sales copies, that is, total cumulative copies.

● Following the inaugural issue of Samch'ŏlli (三千里), we previously published the "Korean Pioneers Issue (朝鮮先驅者號)" and this time, we have made it the "World Leap Forward Issue (世界雄飛號)"; we believe there is certainly a stage that a magazine must ascend. For the next issue, the New Year's Issue (scheduled for release around mid-December this year), we will feature a special edition titled "Past Ten Years, Next Ten Years Issue (先十年, 后十年號)" and report on the state of the past ten years and everything about the upcoming ten years of growth, through writings by individuals from various fields. Besides this, as previously announced, we intend to splendidly adorn the entire pages with an "Overview of Modern Korean Thinkers and Artists (朝鮮現代思想家及文藝家總覽)," the "Eight Views of the Peninsula (半島八景)," and various other special articles whose publication is still being kept secret, so please look forward to it.

● Regarding the previous issue, the Korean Pioneers Issue (朝鮮先驅者號), there were so many orders (法文) even after it sold out that we have recently reprinted it. Those who require it, please place an order. The table of contents is as follows, and the fixed price is 15 *chŏn* (錢). Also, as we intend to establish branch offices, sales points, etc., in various regions, interested parties (有意하분) are requested to ask for the internal regulations (內規).<34>

**Summary**

This announcement from the magazine *Samch'ŏlli* expresses gratitude for its growing readership, comparing its growth to bamboo shoots and chicks. It boasts about its anticipated future success in circulation. It details the themes of recent and upcoming special issues: the "Korean Pioneers Issue," the current "World Leap Forward Issue," and the planned New Year's "Past Ten Years, Next Ten Years Issue." The announcement also mentions future content like an overview of modern Korean thinkers/artists and the Eight Views of the Peninsula, invites orders for a reprint of the popular "Korean Pioneers Issue" (priced at 15 *chŏn*), and seeks interested parties to establish regional branch offices. For colonial history, the text is interesting as it shows a Korean-run magazine actively promoting itself and planning ambitious content reflecting national consciousness ("Korean Pioneers," "Past/Next Ten Years," "Modern Korean Thinkers") and cultural identity ("Eight Views of the Peninsula") despite the colonial context. The mention of themed issues like "World Leap Forward" also hints at aspirations for progress and international awareness within Korean society at the time. The business aspect (circulation goals, reprints, call for branches) highlights the commercial realities and ambitions of publishing under colonialism.
