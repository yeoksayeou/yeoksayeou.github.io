Low Books

A certain village teacher (訓長) went to visit the home of a village scholar/elder (村夫子) and, while chatting idly, asked for some books. First, the village scholar brought out the *Mencius* (孟子), but the teacher rejected it, saying it was too low. Next, he brought the *Analects* (論語), but that too was rejected as low. Finally, even after bringing the *Classic of Poetry* (詩傳) and the *Classic of History* (書傳), they were still rejected as low. The village scholar, astonished by the teacher's great learning, asked, "If the *Analects*, *Mencius*, *Classic of Poetry*, and *Classic of History* are all low, what kind of book is high?"
"No, no. I want to take a nap, so I was asking for a thick book to use as a wooden pillow."

Weight

Female Student: "Oh my, my stomach hurt while reading the book you recently published, sir."
Self-proclaimed Man of Letters (leaping for joy): "Was the book really that interesting?"
Female Student: "No. I yawned while reading it and then just fell asleep, but I fell asleep with the book placed on top of my stomach."

Peace Under Heaven (天下泰平)

A wife on her honeymoon suddenly starts crying in the train carriage. Her husband touches her shoulder.
"Why are you crying?"
"You've become cold... now that we're married."
"Why would you say such a thing again?"
"Well, you've looked out the window twice already since a little while ago. Before, your eyes never left my face..."<32>

**Summary**

This article presents three short humorous anecdotes or jokes. The first plays on the word "low" (나즌/낮은), contrasting intellectual "lowness" with physical "lowness" (height/thickness for a pillow). The second involves a self-proclaimed writer whose book literally causes pain due to its weight when a student falls asleep reading it. The third depicts a newlywed wife interpreting her husband glancing out the window as a sign of waning affection. These vignettes offer glimpses into everyday interactions and humor in late 1920s Korea, touching upon attitudes towards classical learning, literary pretensions, and marital relationships. For historians, they provide lighthearted examples of social commentary, wordplay, and evolving relationship dynamics during the colonial period.
