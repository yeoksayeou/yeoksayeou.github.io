Guard: "Hey you punk, coming back to prison again?"

Five-Time Repeat Offender: "Didn't any mail come for me?"<30>

**Summary**

This brief exchange presents a darkly humorous snapshot of prison life. A guard addresses a returning inmate familiarly, highlighting his repeated incarcerations. The inmate, rather than showing remorse or fear, casually asks about his mail, suggesting a normalization of prison life and perhaps a detachment from his situation. For historians, this vignette offers a glimpse into social attitudes and the experience of recidivism during the colonial period, possibly reflecting indifference or resignation within the prison system and among repeat offenders.
