Article Title: 男女同浴의 風俗 (The Custom of Mixed-Gender Bathing)
Author: [Not specified in the provided text]
Article Type: 잡저 (Miscellaneous writing/notes)

In records of the Koryŏ Dynasty customs, such as the "Kyerim Yusa" or the "Koryŏ Togyŏng," it is written that when men and women bathed in streams on summer days, there was no separation between the sexes.

In Tong Wŏl's (董越) "Chosŏn Pu" (朝鮮賦), it is stated regarding the fact of mixed-gender bathing, "It appeared in old records, but now it has changed," indicating that this custom seems to have changed by the time of the Yi Dynasty (李朝).

However, the fact of mixed bathing is also recorded in the "Taemyŏng Il T'ongji" (大明一統志). The Yi Dynasty was greatly concerned about this. It was an unspeakable agony that what they saw as a barbarian custom (夷秋의 風習) was clearly written in the official history (正史) of the superior country (上國 - China).

In the 18th year of King Chungjong's reign, when an envoy from Ming China arrived, the high ministers explained the situation and requested a policy for revision. The Ming envoy replied that, based on what he had actually seen, there was no such custom, so it must have been a fact recorded in old documents, and he would report back to the throne about a policy for revision when the opportunity arose. Nowadays, in the countryside, women enter the river water to bathe after sunset during times like summer. If it is one's own wife, the husband stands guard at a slightly distanced spot.<299>

**Summary**

The article discusses historical accounts of mixed-gender bathing (男女同浴) in Korea. It notes records like the "Kyerim Yusa" and "Koryŏ Togyŏng" mentioning the practice during the Koryŏ Dynasty, while sources like Tong Wŏl's "Chosŏn Pu" suggest it changed by the Yi Dynasty (Chosŏn). However, its inclusion in the Chinese "Taemyŏng Il T'ongji" caused distress for the Chosŏn court, which viewed it as barbaric and sought its removal from Chinese records, as shown by an appeal to a Ming envoy during King Chungjong's reign. The article concludes by observing that a related practice persisted in rural areas in the contemporary (1940) period, where women bathed in rivers after sunset, sometimes guarded by their husbands. From a historical perspective, the article is interesting as it highlights the changing social norms regarding gender separation, the Chosŏn Dynasty's acute sensitivity to how its customs were perceived and recorded by Ming China (the "Superior Country"), and the persistence of folk customs in rural areas despite official disapproval or societal shifts.

男女同浴의 風俗
高麗時代의 風俗을 記錄한 「鷄林類事」에라든지 「高麗圖經」에라든지 남녀가 夏日 溪流에 목욕하는데 男女別이 없었다고 씨어 있다.
董越의 「朝鮮賦」에는, 男女同浴의 사실을, 舊誌엔 낫으나, 지금은 變更하다, 라 했으니까, 李朝에 이르러서 이 風俗은 변한 모양이다.
그랫는데 「大明一統志」엔 또 同浴의 사실이 기록되어 있다. 李朝에선 그것을 크게 걱정했다. 夷秋의 風習으로 보는 것이 上國 正史에 역역히 씨여 있다는 것이 말할 수 없는 苦痛이었다.
中宗王 18년, 明나라 使者가 왔을 때, 大臣은 사정을 이야기하고 그 改訂方針을 부탁했다. 明使는 정말 자기가 보건대, 그런 風習이 없음으로 그것은 아마 舊誌에, 기록된 사실인가 부다고, 기회를 보아서 改正方針을 奏上하겠느라고 말했다. 現今, 시골에선 여름같은 때 婦女들이 해진 다음 강물에 들어 목욕한다, 그것이 자기의 안해인 경우엔 남편이 좀 떠러진 곳에서 직히고 있는 것이다.<299>
