**Body Text Translation:**
Water Bends
						岸曙

The twelve points of Changsan Point,
Point by point, treacherous waters.
Coming boats turn back, only the boatman cries, they say.
Ah, what to do, what to do, what to do about this human heart?
Though not Changsan Point, this human heart is treacherous! <152>

The twelve points of Changsan Point,
Point by point, whirlpools.
Once caught in the water's bend, escape is impossible, they say.
Ah, what to do, what to do, what to do about this human heart?
Though not Changsan Point, this human heart is a whirlpool!

Changsan Point has twelve branches,
Point by point, leaping waves.
Seagulls, too, having nothing else to do, fly in and cry out, they say.
Ah, what to do, what to do, what to do about this human heart?
Though not Changsan Point, this human heart is a wave! <153>

**Summary**

This poem by Ansŏ repeatedly compares the dangerous waters of Changsan Point—its treacherous currents, whirlpools, and waves—to the human heart (or human nature). Each stanza describes a specific danger of Changsan Point, noting how even boats turn back or how escape is impossible, and concludes with the lament, "Ah, what to do about this human heart?" implying that human nature is just as perilous and unpredictable as the infamous sea passage. The poem expresses a sense of despair or cynicism regarding the untrustworthiness and difficulty of navigating human relationships or society. For historians, the poem reflects a possible mood of disillusionment or anxiety during the late colonial period. The comparison of internal human failings ("人心") to an external, uncontrollable natural force (the sea at Changsan Point) might subtly comment on the perceived harshness or unpredictability of the social or political environment without directly addressing it. The author's pen name, 岸曙 (Ansŏ), using Hanja, is also typical of the era.

물구비
						岸曙
장산곳이 열두곳은
곳이곳이 혐난한 물.
오든 배는 돌아서고 사공님만 울린다지.
아하 어이하랴 어이하랴, 이 人心을 어이하랴,
장산곳은 아니라도 이 人心이 험난고야.<152>

장산곳이 열 두 곳은
곳이곳이 소용도리.
물구비에 한번 들면 헤여나기 萬無라지.
아하 어이하랴 어이하랴, 이 人心을 어이하랴,
장산곳은 아니라도 이 人心이 송도리라.

장산곳은 열 두 갈래
곳이곳이 뛰는 물결.
갈매기도 할 일 없어 날아들며 웨친다지.
아하 어이하랴 어이하랴 이 人心을 어이하랴,
장산곳은 아니라도 이 人心이 물결이라.<153>
