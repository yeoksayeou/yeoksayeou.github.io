Anthem for the Founding of New China

Wang Jingwei

In commemoration of the National Government's return to the capital, Mr. Wang Jingwei himself wrote the lyrics for the Founding Anthem, and the composition was also already completed. It received its premiere performance by the National Music Ensemble on the occasion of the ceremony last April 26th, and it is translated and published in this journal.

How numerous, the four hundred million people!
How vast, the four million square li of mountains and rivers!
How long-lasting, the four thousand years of history,<238>
Let us weep, let us sing,
Upholding the Three Principles of the People,
Let us advance towards the Great Unity world.
The bandit tribes run rampant,
The four seas are impoverished.
This handful of pure earth
Is where drops of loyal blood flow.
Both you and I stand resolutely,
Even if our bodies perish and our homes are scattered,
Even if our bodies perish and our homes are scattered,
Let us unite and advance,
Let us join hearts and move forward.
-End-<239>

Two Chinese Folk Songs

Magpie Sparrow Song (Hubei)

Translated by Pak Yŏng-hŭi

The magpie and sparrow have pretty tails (美).
On Qingming Day, they marry off a maiden,
She was sent to a clod of earth because she was too small,
The earth clod smelled bad, so she was sent to the green bean,
The green bean smelled fragrant, so she was sent to the ginger,<240>
The ginger was too spicy, so she was sent to the loquat (批把),
The loquat was soft, so she was sent to the *banja* (thin board/paper?),
The *banja* was too thin, so she was sent to the ox horn,
The ox horn was too old (hard?), so it was cut with a knife,
The knife blade was sharp, so it cut the Chinese cabbage (白菜),
The Chinese cabbage is delicious, let's spend good times,
The Chinese cabbage is green (靑), let's make a lamp and light it,
The lamplight is bright, very good for calculating (計算),
The old woman, the old man,
Counting (計算) what they sold all day, the night turned into dawn.<241>

Little Sister Rides a Donkey (Beijing) (小妹妹騎驢)

Little sister rides a donkey,
I ride a horse,
Taking little sister with me,
I went to battle.
Little sister died,
How could I live on?
Little sister, in the afterlife,
Please wait for me.
(Note: Little sister can also mean lover (戀人))<242>

Elegy

Ms. Bing Xin
Translated by Im Hak-su

Around her, there is only blood and tears—
People hold up the banner of "Need" (需要)
And make her write of blood and love,
So she finally laughed a laugh she wanted to cry.

Around her, there is only light and love—
People hold up the banner of "Need" (需要)
And make her write of blood and tears,
So she finally cried a cry she wanted to laugh.<243>

A laugh one wants to cry,
A cry one wants to laugh—
People again raised the banner of "Need" (需要),
But she had already disappeared from this world!

Huangpu River Mouth

Guo Moruo
Translated by Im Hak-su

Peaceful homeland,
Land of my father and mother,
The grass on the bank is so green,
The flowing water is so rich,<244>

Leaning on the ship's window, I gaze afar,
The flat, vast land is like the sea,
Except for those green willow waves,
There isn't a single peak blocking the view.

A small boat (小舟) lightly sways on the waves,
People seem completely as if in a dream—
Ah, peaceful homeland,
Land of my father and mother!

Accidentally

Xu Zhimo
Translated by Im Hak-su

I am a single cloud floating in the sky,<245>
Sometimes perhaps casting a shadow on the waves of your heart—
Do not be surprised,
Nor should you rejoice,
It is but for a moment, soon the shadow will vanish.

We met on the dark night sea,
But you have your path, and I have mine—
You may remember me,
Or you may forget,
Only that we cast a brief light when we met.
-End-<246>

**Summary**

This article from the June 1940 issue of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine presents a collection of contemporary Chinese poetry and folk songs translated into Korean. It includes the "Anthem for the Founding of New China" by Wang Jingwei (head of the Japanese-backed Reorganized National Government of China), two folk songs ("Magpie Sparrow Song" from Hubei and "Little Sister Rides a Donkey" from Beijing) translated by Pak Yŏng-hŭi, and poems by prominent modern Chinese writers Bing Xin ("Elegy"), Guo Moruo ("Huangpu River Mouth"), and Xu Zhimo ("Accidentally"), translated by Im Hak-su. The collection aims to introduce readers to aspects of "New Chinese Literature." From a historical perspective, the inclusion of Wang Jingwei's anthem, celebrating his collaborationist regime established in Nanjing just months earlier (March 1940), alongside works by other respected, non-collaborationist Chinese writers, is particularly noteworthy. It reflects the complex political and cultural landscape during the height of the Second Sino-Japanese War and Japanese colonial rule in Korea, showcasing how cultural products, even those from occupied or collaborating territories, were disseminated.

汪精衛

國民政府還都를 기념하여 汪精衛氏 自身이 建國歌를 作詞하고, 作曲도 이미 만들어서 지난 4월 26일의 典禮를 期하여 國民音樂隊에서 初演奏하였는데 譯하여 本誌에 실리기로 한다.

많을 손 四億萬의 百姓
넓을 손 四百萬方里의 山河
悠悠하도다 四千年의 歷史,<238>
울자, 노래 부르자
三民主義 내세우고
大同世界로 나아가세.
寇族이 猖獗하여
四海가 困窮했도다.
이 한줌의 淸淨한 흙은
一滴의 盡忠의 피 흐르는 곳
나도 乃子도 모두 敢然히 서서
몸 亡치고 家散할지라도
몸 亡치고 家散할지라도
團結하여 나아가세
合心하여 전진하세.

支那民謠二篇

鴉雀歌(湖北)

朴英熙 譯

까치와 참새는 꽁지가 예뻐(美).
淸明날 處女를 시집을 보내는데
너무도 적어서 흙괴안테 보냇드니
흙괴는 냄새나서 綠豆에게 보냇드니
綠豆는 香내나서 生薑에게 보냇드니<240>
生薑은 매움해서 批把에게 보냇드니
批把는 부드러워 반자에게 보냇드니
반자는 너무 얇어 쇠뿔에게 보냇드니
쇠뿔은 너무 노아 칼노서 잘너버려
칼날은 날카로와 白菜를 잘너버려
白菜는 맛잇구나 조흔 歲月 보내지구
白菜는 빛이 푸러(靑) 燈 만들어 불을 키자
燈불은 빛이 밝어 셈(計算)하기가 아조 좋아
늙은 老婆, 늙은 영감,
하로 판 것 세느라고(計算) 밤이 밝엇다.<241>

누이는 로새타고(北京)  (小妹妹騎驢)

누이는 로새타고
나는 말타고
누이를 데리고서
싸홈 갓드니
누이가 죽엇스나
내 어찌 살랴
누이아, 저승에서
기다려다고.
(註. 누이는 戀人으로도 意味한다)<242>

哀詞

冰心女史
林學洙 譯

그의 周圍에는 오직 피와 눈물이 잇거늘-
사람들 「需要」의 旗발을 들고
그로 하여금 피와 사랑을 쓰게 하매
그는 마침내 울고 싶은 우슴을 우섰도다.

그의 周圍에는 오직 빛과 사랑이 잇거늘-
사람들 「需要」의 旗발을 들고
그로 하여금 피와 눈물을 쓰게 하매
그는 마침내 웃고 싶은 우름을 우렀도다.<243>

울고 싶은 우슴
웃고 싶은 우름--
사람들 또 「需要」의 旗발을 드렀으나
이미 이 세상에서 사라지고 없었도다!

黃浦江口

郭沫若
林學洙

平和로운 故鄕이여
내 父母의 고장이여,
기슭의 풀 저러케도 푸르고
흐르는 물 이러케도 기름지고<244>

船窓에 기대여 멀리 바라매
平坦한 大地는 바다같어
저 푸르른 柳波를 除하고는
앞을 막는 하낱 봉오리도 없구나.

小舟 가벼히 문결 우에 흔들리니
사람들은 완연히 꿈속에나 잇는 듯-
아, 平和로운 故鄕이어
내 父母의 고장이여!

偶然
徐志摩
林學洙 譯

나는 하늘에 뜬 한조각 구름<245>
때로 혹 너의 波心에 그림자를 던지나니-
의아하지마라
기뻐할 것도 없다
그도 잠시, 이윽고 그림자는 사르지고 마르리.

우리는 검은 밤바다 우에서 만낫도다
그러나 너에게는 너의 나에게는 나의 갈 길이 있어-
나를 記憶하여도 좋다
잊어도 좋다
다만 이 서로 만났을 때 잠시 빛을 던질 뿐.
