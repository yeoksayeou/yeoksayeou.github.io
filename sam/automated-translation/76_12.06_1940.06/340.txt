Life Planning

While looking for a room to rent.
Wife: Hey, let's make this room our Music Room.
Husband: What? We don't even have a single record, let alone a piano...
Wife: But the neighbor's radio sounds best in this room, doesn't it?

Clever

Friend: Look here. Shall I tell you about Mr. Kim staying out last night?
Wife: No need, the master [my husband] already confessed everything.
Friend: What? Then why did you call for me?
Wife: To see what you would say. <229>

The second, "Clever," shows a wife cleverly handling a friend who seemingly came to gossip about her husband's night out, revealing the wife's shrewdness.
