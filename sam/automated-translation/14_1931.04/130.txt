Anatomy of Chosŏn's Greatest Chaebol
						Chu Yun

Said to Have ₩2 Million in Real Assets
Mr. Tasan Pak Yŏngch'ŏl (多山 朴榮喆) is currently the President (頭取) of the Chosŏn Commercial Bank, which has its headquarters in Seoul and branches and agencies throughout all of Korea, with a capital of ₩9 million. We have already looked at Min Yŏnghwi (閔泳徽) of land, Ch'oe Ch'anghak (崔昌學) of gold mining, and Kim Sŏngsu (金性洙) of textiles as Chosŏn's greatest chaebol. Now, regarding Mr. Pak Yŏngch'ŏl, whom we intend to describe, while his current possessed wealth might be considered inferior to the aforementioned three gentlemen, we believe there is much more reason to pay attention to his future, reigning as he does over the financial world.

People say Min Yŏnghwi's fortune exceeds ₩10 million, the Kim Sŏngsu line exceeds ₩5 million, and Ch'oe Ch'anghak exceeds ₩3 million. Regarding the fortune of Mr. Pak Yŏngch'ŏl, whom we are now discussing, some say it is ₩4 or ₩5 million, while others seem to call it only ₩1 million. However, based on this writer's investigation, it is estimated to be around ₩2 million. This is because his investments in modern industries (i.e., factories and others) are not clearly apparent, making it impossible to know where and how much capital is invested. However, if one evaluates and sums up his currently owned shares in the Commercial Bank where he holds the president's chair (he is the largest shareholder among Korean stockholders), his semi-Western style house in Sogyeok-dong, Kyŏngsŏng, and others (market price approx. ₩10,000), his savings, his shares in the Rice Storage and other bank companies, and the land he owns in the Chŏnju and Iri plains, estimating it at no less than ₩2 million would be an accurate measurement (正鵠).

Furthermore, he possesses knowledge and insight (識見) regarding the economic world. Compared to Messrs. Min Yŏnghwi, Ch'oe Ch'anghak, <44> and Kim Sŏngsu, this is truly the strong point that allows us to anticipate his future development, that is, an even greater increase in wealth. So, what kind of person (爲人) is this man, whose future seems poised for an even more remarkable leap in the financial world than his present?

Initially a Military Officer
He was born in the 488th year of the founding of the kingdom (開國), making him 52 this spring, in Chŏnju, North Chŏlla Province, into a small merchant family. His father is Mr. Pak Kisun (朴基順), the land king whom almost everyone in the 53 counties of Chŏlla Province likely knows today. Mr. Pak Kisun lost his father at the age of twelve and worked as an errand boy (使喚) for another shop before starting his own rice merchant business (米穀商). Eventually, he transported rice from the Chŏnju plains to Kunsan, then sailed back to Inch'ŏn, making his first large profit (巨利) from this trade. With that large profit, he gradually bought up the fertile fields (沃野) of the Samnam region (southern three provinces). It has already been over 10 years since this self-made (自手成家) landowner earned the name of a *mansŏkkun* (萬石꾼, owner of land yielding 10,000 *sŏk* of rice).
He founded the Samnam Bank (三南銀行) in Chŏnju, striving to build a financial foundation centered on Koreans, and also served as its president (頭取), as well as holding executive positions in various companies.

Mr. Pak Yŏngch'ŏl is the lucky child of hereditary property inheritance (世襲財産相續), born to such a father, and he is destined to become the future master of these Chŏnju fertile fields. Mr. Pak Kisun is already at the advanced age of 74.
Mr. Pak Yŏngch'ŏl went to Tokyo and attended the Military Academy (士官學校). Among his classmates (同窓) at that time were Yi Kap (李甲), Yu Tongyŏl (柳東悅), and Kim Ŭngsŏn (金應善), while his seniors (先輩) included No Paengnin (盧伯麟) and Cho Sŏnggŭn (趙性根). Not long after graduation (未幾), the Russo-Japanese War broke out.
He served in the army (從軍) in Manchuria as an officer in the Imperial Guard Cavalry Regiment (近衛師團騎兵聯隊). The division commander (師圍長) at that time was Hasegawa Yoshimichi (長谷川好道).
There is a poem Tasan composed when he climbed the T'onggunjŏng Pavilion in Ŭiju while on campaign (出征中途):

表裡山河關防地  (Land naturally fortified by mountains and rivers, a strategic pass)
登臨今古少英雄  (Ascending and looking out, few heroes past or present)
腰間寶劍吟龍吼  (The precious sword at my waist sings a dragon's roar)
雨後長歌氣貫虹  (After rain, a long song; spirit pierces the rainbow)

After the Russo-Japanese War ended, he was summoned by the Korean Government and served successively as an instructor at the old Korean Military Academy (舊韓國武官學校), instructor at the Cadet School (幼年學校), Adjutant at the Ministry of War (軍部副官), and finally Aide-de-Camp to the Emperor (侍從武官). After the annexation (合倂), he served successively as County Magistrate (郡守), Councilor (參與官), and Provincial Governor (道知事).
Then, when his father resigned as President (頭取) at the Samnam Bank general meeting on January 19, Showa 2 (1927), he became the successor Director (後任取締役) and later became President (頭取).
The Samnam Bank was a bank with a capital of ₩1 million. Through various circumstances, it merged (合倂) with the current Chosŏn Commercial Bank three years ago. At that time, he was Vice President (副頭取), but this spring, following the retirement (引退) of President Wada (和田頭取), he succeeded him and became President (頭取). The Commercial Bank (商銀), the successor (後身) of the Ch'ŏnil Bank (天一銀行) founded in the 3rd year of Kwangmu (1899) as Chosŏn's first bank, has over 20 branches in various locations across the 13 provinces, and its future activities will draw everyone's attention (萬目).

As he settles in as a banker, how much skill (手腕) he will display in the future is something to be judged (批判) based on his future achievements (業績), so we will stop here for now.
Will his assets (資産), accumulating (蓄積) more and more day by day and month by month (日加月增), eventually be channeled into fields such as industry and education? It is an interesting (興味) question.
Furthermore, he holds executive positions (重役) in many important companies in the capital and provinces (京鄕), beginning with (爲始) the Chosŏn Rice Storage Company (朝鮮米穀倉庫會社). When he retired (退할 때) as Provincial Governor, he assumed the post (就任) of Auditor (監査) at the Tōtaku Company (東拓會社, Oriental Development Company). <45>

**Summary**

This 1931 article profiles Pak Yŏngch'ŏl, president of the Chosŏn Commercial Bank, estimating his wealth at ₩2 million, less than other major figures like Min Yŏnghwi or Kim Sŏngsu, but highlighting his potential due to his financial acumen and position. It details his background: son of wealthy landowner Pak Kisun, educated at the Japanese Military Academy, served in the Russo-Japanese War and later held various military and administrative positions in the Korean Empire and under Japanese rule (aide-de-camp, governor). He transitioned to finance, succeeding his father at the Samnam Bank, which later merged with the Chosŏn Commercial Bank, where he eventually became president. The article notes his significant shareholdings, property, and directorships in various companies, including the Chosŏn Rice Storage Company and the Oriental Development Company (Tōtaku), speculating on his future influence in industry and education.

For historians, the article offers insights into the formation of Korean capitalist elites under colonial rule. It shows the transition path for some members of the traditional elite or their descendants from military/government service (often intertwined with Japanese structures) into modern finance and industry. The mention of inherited wealth (from his landowning father) combined with participation in Japanese-sponsored institutions (military academy, Tōtaku) illustrates the complex routes to economic power and potential collaboration within the colonial system. The comparison with other chaebol figures provides context for the structure of the colonial Korean economy.

朝鮮最大財閥 解剖
						朱潤
實力은 2百萬圓說
多山 朴榮喆씨는 現在 서울에 本店을 두고 全鮮各處에 支店과 代理店을 가진 資本金 9백만원의 朝鮮商業銀行의 頭取로 잇다. 우리는 이미 朝鮮最大의 財閥로서 土地의 閔泳徽씨 金鑛의 崔昌學씨 紡績의 金性洙씨등을 보앗거니와 이제 記述하려하는 朴榮喆씨에 이르려는 或은 現有의 所有된 富의 點에 이르런 前記 三氏보다 遜色이 잇다 할 것이나 그러나 金融界에 君臨하고 잇는 氏의 將來에 대하여는 그 以上 더 注目할 바가 잇스리라고 밋는 터이다.
世上사람들은 閔泳徽씨의 財産울 1천만원 以上, 金性洙氏系를 5백만원 以上, 崔昌學씨를 3백만원 以上이라 하거니와 只今 論하려는 朴榮喆씨의 財産에 대하여는 或은 4, 5백만원이라고도하고 或은 單백만원 이라고도 부르는 모양이나 筆者의 調査로 보건대 약 2백만원은 된다고 본다. 이것은 氏가 近代産業方面(卽工場其他)에 投資한 것이 뛰렷하게 나타나지 안어 어느 곳 어느 곳에 얼마 얼마의 投下資金이 잇는지를 알길이 업서서 그리함이나 그러나 現在 頭取의 椅子를 차지하고 잇는 商業銀行의 所有株券(朝鮮人株主중에는 最大株主이다)과 京城昭 格洞의 半洋制家屋 及其他(時價 약 만원)과 貯金과 米穀倉庫其他의 銀行會社의 株券과 그러고 全州와 裡里平野에 가지고 잇는 土地를 評價合算한다면 2백만원은 不下할 것이다함이 正鵠을 어든 測定이리라.
그러고 氏는 經濟界에 대한 識見이 잇다. 閔泳徽, 崔昌學,＜44＞ 金性洙씨등에 比하야 그 將來의 發展을 卽 富의 보담 더의 增大를 豫期할 수 잇게 하는 强點이 實로 여기에 잇는 것이다. 그러면 이와가티 現在보다도 將來가 더욱 甛目하게 金融界에 飛躍할 듯한 氏는 그러면 엇더한 爲人이든가.

最初는 武官으로
氏는 開國 488년생이니 今春 52歲 全北全州, 一小商家에 태어낫섯다. 父親은 今日 全羅道 53州에서 모르는 이가 거이 업슬듯한 土地王 朴基順씨, 朴基順씨는 열두살되든 해에 父親을 여이고 다른 商店의 使喚노릇을 하다가 米穀商을 自營하야 끗끗내 全州平野의 米穀을 群山에 移送하고 다시 仁川에 回航하여 그리하는데서 처음 巨利를 得하엿다. 得한 그 巨利로 작고작고 三南의 沃野를 사드리엇다. 自手成家한 이 地主는 萬石꾼의 일홈을 드른지 벌서 10여년이다.
氏는 全州三南銀行을 創立하여 朝鮮人中心의 金融地盤築成에 努力하고 또 그 頭取가 되엇든 일도 잇스며 여러 會社의 重役들도 歷任하엿다.
이러한 이를 아버지로 가지고 태어난 世襲財産相續의 幸運兒가 朴榮喆씨이니 氏는 應當 압프로 이 全州沃野의 主人이 될 것이다. 朴基順씨는 벌서 74의 高齡이니까.
朴榮喆씨는 東京에 드러가 士官學校에 다녓다. 그 때 氏의 同窓속에는 李甲, 柳東悅, 金應善씨 등이 잇섯고 先輩로는 盧伯麟, 趙性根 씨등이 잇섯다. 卒業未幾에 日露戰爭이 터지엇다.
氏는 近衛師團騎兵聯隊士官으로 滿洲에 從軍하엿다. 그 때의 師圍長이 長谷川好道이엇다.
多山이 出征中途에 義州統軍亭에 올라 詩一首를 지은 것이 잇다.

表裡山河關防地  登臨今古少英雄
腰間寶劍吟龍吼  雨後長歌氣貫虹

그 뒤 日露戰爭이 끈은 뒤 韓國政府의 부름을 바더 舊韓國武官學校敎官, 幼年學校敎官, 軍部副官, 나종에는 侍從武官까지 歷任한 뒤 合倂 以後 郡守, 參與官, 道知事등을 歷任하엿다.
그러다가 그 父親이 昭和 2년1월19일 三南銀行總會에서 頭取를 辭하자 氏가 後任取締役이 되고 나종에 頭取로 되엇섯다.
三南銀行은 資本金 백만원의 銀行이다. 이것이 여러 가지 事情을 經하야 現在의 朝鮮商業銀行과 3년전에 合倂함에 이르럿다. 그 때 氏는 副頭取엇스나 今春에 和田頭取가 引退한 후를 繼하야 바로 頭取가 되엇다. 商銀은 光武 3년에 創立된 朝鮮最初의 銀行 天一銀行의 後身으로 13道 各地에 20以上의 支店을 가지고 잇스며 압프로 그 活躍은 萬目을 끄은다 할 것이다.

銀行業者로 안저 氏가 압프로 얼마나한 手腕를 둘늘가 하는 것은 압프로 그 業績을 보아 批判할 것임으로 여기는 爲先 이에 끈치기로 한다.
더욱 日加月增으로 蓄積에 又 蓄積되는 氏의 資産은 장차 産業, 敎育등 方面에도 던지어 지지안을가. 興味잇는 問題이다.
그러고 氏는 朝鮮米穀倉庫會社를 爲始하야 京鄕의 重要會社에 重役의 任을 맛고잇는 곳이 만타. 道知事를 退할 때는 東拓會社의 監査에 就任하엿섯다.＜45＞
