**Body Text Translation:**
Because of War
戰爭 때문에 (Because of War)

When a war breaks out, an enormous amount of money is wasted (虛費된다). Looking at the war expenses (戰費) wasted in the most famous wars of recent times (近世中):
Napoleonic Wars (奈巴倫戰爭) 12.5 billion Won
Crimean War (크리미아戰爭) 3.4 billion Won
American Civil War (南北戰爭) 16 billion Won
Franco-Prussian War (普佛戰爭) 7 billion Won
Russo-Japanese War (日露戰爭) 5 billion Won
Great European War (歐州大戰爭) 377.2 billion Won

If It Were One Shot, One Life (一發一命)
During the Russo-Japanese War (日露戰爭), the number of cannonballs and bullets (彈丸數) fired (노흔) by the Japanese Army (日本軍) was 1,049,000 rounds (發).
During the Great European War (歐州大戰), the French Army (佛國軍) alone fired 340 million rounds (發), the British Army (英國軍隊) 300 million rounds (發), while the German Army (獨逸軍) fired 580 million rounds (發). If one person had been killed with each shot, the human race (人種) would have disappeared (업서젓슬) from the Earth (地球上).

The Dead (死者)
Since the topic of cannonballs (砲彈) came up (낫스니), let's finish (마저) the story (이약이). During the Sino-Japanese War (日淸戰爭), out of 178,292 Japanese soldiers (日本軍) dispatched (出征한), the number of war dead who turned into white bones (白骨) on the battlefield (戰場) was 4,950. During the Russo-Japanese War (日露戰爭) also (亦是), out of 998,868 dispatched soldiers, there were 46,423 war dead and over 154,000 wounded (負傷者).
During the Great European War (歐州大戰), out of the German Army's (獨逸軍) strength (兵力) of 11 million men, 1,636,061 died. Out of the Russian Army's (露軍) 12 million, 1.7 million died. Out of the British Army's (英軍) 8,654,467, 929,812 died. Out of the French Army's (佛軍) 8,407,000, there were (잇섯다) 1,109,000 deaths (死者). These are horrifying (끔직한) white bones (白骨들). The total number of deaths (總死者) during the turmoil of the European War was 7,848,031. In which sky are these many (만흔) souls (靈魂) floating? <36>

**Summary**

This article from 1931 quantifies the immense cost of modern warfare, both financially and in human lives. It lists the monetary expenses of major conflicts from the Napoleonic Wars to World War I and contrasts the vast number of munitions fired with the relatively lower (though still horrific) number of resulting deaths, implying immense waste. It then details the staggering casualty figures for Japan in the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars, and for Germany, Russia, Britain, and France in World War I, emphasizing the scale of death. From a colonial Korean perspective, the article's focus on the costs and casualties, particularly citing Japanese wars, could be read as a subtle critique of militarism and its devastating consequences, presenting factual data on war's horrors during a period of Japanese imperial expansion. Historians might find the specific figures cited, the comparison between munitions and deaths, and the overall tone reflecting on the human cost significant for understanding contemporary attitudes towards war and imperial conflict.
