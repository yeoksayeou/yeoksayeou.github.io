A Social Study of Internal Disturbances in Korea
						By Pugaksanin

I. Types of Internal Disturbances

What is referred to here as "internal disturbance" (內亂) naturally includes actions corresponding to the crime of internal disturbance in the current criminal code, but the meaning is broadened to encompass everything from gatherings of ruffians (凶徒聚集), political conspiracies and assassinations, modern communist incidents, and school incidents—anything that can be seen as the seed of internal disturbance and collectively causes social disorder (粉訌).

Viewing the types of internal disturbances based on the social class of the principal instigators who planned them, they can be broadly divided into the following three types:
1. Scholar Rebellions (士亂): Those where Yangban (兩班) were the principal instigators and the central force.
2. Popular Rebellions (民亂): Those where the common people (人民) were the principal instigators or the main force.
3. Bandit Rebellions (盜亂): Those where bandits (盜賊) were the principal instigators.

In both the Koryŏ Dynasty and the Yi Dynasty, due to the national character (國質) of Chosŏn, royal authority was not wielded so strongly. Except for times when great statesmen like the founding kings (太祖) of both dynasties were on the throne, during other periods, the foundation of royal authority was shaken, and internal disturbances were frequent.

However, due to the trends of the times leading up to today, the roots from which the first type, Scholar Rebellions, and the third type, Bandit Rebellions, could arise have been destroyed, so they have ceased to occur. If there is concern about future occurrences, it would likely be in the aspect of the second type, Popular Rebellions. Below, I will outline the general history of the aforementioned three types of conflict and finally elucidate their characteristics.

II. Scholar Rebellions (士亂)

There are various forms of Scholar Rebellions.
First, fighting openly with military force.
Second, planning the replacement of the king with military power as background influence, and then installing a king from one's own faction after the replacement.
Third, attempting to replace the king or overthrow the power holders of the time through political conspiracy and take their place.

From the old days of the Koryŏ Dynasty, Scholar Rebellions of all three types mentioned above never ceased. Among them, the largest of the first type were the rebellion led by the monk Myoch'ŏng (妙淸) during King Injong's reign, who conspired with Vice Minister of Rites (分司侍郞) Cho Kwang (趙匡) and Junior Officer of Palace Supplies (司宰少卿) Cho Ch'angŏn (趙昌言), basing themselves in P'yŏngyang (平壤); and during King Wŏnjong's reign, the rebellion in Chŏlla (全羅) led by General Pae Chungson (裵仲孫) with the troops of the Sambyŏlch'o (三別抄). These were of the largest scale; at these times, the capital and the provinces trembled, and even though large armies were mobilized several times for their suppression, they were not easily quelled, although they were eventually crushed by government forces.

The revolution of Yi Sŏnggye (李成桂), the founder of the Yi Dynasty, also combined the first, second, and third types, but he succeeded due to his actual power, virtue and reputation, opportune timing (天時), and popular support. In the end, the Koryŏ Dynasty was leaning towards decline due to the self-poisoning of aristocratic misrule (貴族專權惡政) and was fated to eventually fall into the hands of military officials.

Listing those corresponding to the first type during the Yi Dynasty:
1. The Rebellion of Yi Chingok (李澄玉) in the 2nd year of King Tanjong. This occurred when Yi Chingok was the Military Commander (節制使) of Hamgil Province (咸吉道). Upon learning of the political change in the capital where Sejo (世祖) had deposed Tanjong (端宗), he killed Pak Howŏn (朴好問), who had come to replace him, raised troops at once, marched north across the Tuman River (豆滿江), occupied Oguksong (五國城), the old capital of the Jin (金), gathered people, declared himself Emperor of Great Jin (大金皇帝), and intended to attack Chosŏn. However, he fell into a plot by the magistrate of Chongsŏng (鍾城府使) midway and was assassinated.
2. The Rebellion of Yi Siae (李施愛) in the 13th year of King Sejo. Yi Siae, originally the magistrate of Hoeryŏng (會寧府使), raised troops within the province, killed the Military Governor (節度使) of Hamgyŏng Province (咸鏡道), Kang Hyomun (康孝文), and the magistrate <25> of Kilchu (吉州), Sŏl Chŏngsin (薛澄新), and rebelled from Kilchu. Almost the entire northern province fell into his hands. At that time, the sentiment in the capital and provinces was tumultuous (洶洶), and it was barely suppressed with 30,000 troops from six provinces. It is said there were collaborators within Seoul at this time, ready to respond internally and externally depending on the situation.
3. The Rebellion of Yi Kwal (李适) in the 2nd year of King Injo. Yi Kwal's merit should have been ranked first during the Injo Restoration (仁祖反正). After Injo drove out Kwanghaegun (光海君) and ascended the throne, during the awarding of merits, both he and others expected him to become Minister of War (兵曹判書), but he was demoted to the second rank and appointed as Military Commander of P'yŏngan Province (平安兵使), being sent to the provinces. Harboring discontent, he raised troops, entered Seoul, and even organized a provisional government. However, three days after entering the capital, he was defeated by government forces and fled through Sigumun gate (屍口門). Two days later, he was captured and executed by beheading.
4. The Rebellion of Yi In'gŏ (李仁居) in the 5th year of King Injo - Yi In'gŏ, residing in Hoengsŏng (橫城) and discontented with current affairs, attempted to restore Kwanghaegun. He captured the Hoengsŏng county magistrate (縣監), released prisoners, seized weapons, and tried to march on the capital, but was suppressed by the Wŏnju magistrate (原州牧師). It is said there were collaborators in Seoul at this time as well.
5. The Rebellion of Yi In-jwa (李麟佐) in the 4th year of King Yŏngjo - Yi In-jwa first entered the Ch'ŏngju (淸州) military barracks, killed the commander (兵使), proclaimed himself Great Marshal (大元師), and attempted to march on the capital, but was defeated midway by government forces.
6. The Rebellion of Hong Kyŏngnae (洪景來) in the 11th year of King Sunjo - Hong Kyŏngnae, a man from Yonggang (龍岡) county, harboring discontent that the Yi Dynasty did not employ talent from the northwest (西北), plotted a revolution. Gathering gold miners from Kasan (嘉山) and Kwaksan (郭山) and other discontented elements, he raised troops, broke through Kasan, Kwaksan, Pakch'ŏn (博川), T'aech'ŏn (泰川), and Chŏngju (定州), and entered Sŏnch'ŏn (宣川), but was defeated by government forces. This rebellion truly shook the capital, and its suppression required two months.
7. The Incident of the Enlightenment Party (開化黨) in the 21st year of King Kojong (李太王). This incident arose from the political struggle between the Pro-China Party (事大黨) and the Enlightenment Party (開化黨). Kim Okkyun (金玉均), Pak Yŏnghyo (朴泳孝), and others attempted to overthrow the Pro-China Party, using the opening ceremony of the Post Office (郵政局) as an opportunity to act. However, due to the withdrawal of the Japanese minister, it ended with the exile of the Enlightenment Party members.
8. The Incident of Meiji 41 (1908) - Due to the abdication of King Kojong resulting from the Hague Secret Emissary Affair, the transfer of military authority to Japan, etc., anti-Japanese sentiment rose greatly. Triggered by the disbandment of the army, a contingent of troops in the capital started an incident, which became the catalyst for the entire country to respond, with disturbances erupting everywhere like beehives (버리중주리가치).
They were suppressed by the Japanese army, military police (憲兵), and police officers. It took 5 months until pacification. Korean casualties (死傷) were 1,250, Japanese 120; houses burned numbered 6,800. Military police and police officers killed in action were 52 Koreans and 127 Japanese; wounded were 352 Japanese and 25 Koreans. Casualties on the side that initiated the disturbances reached 14,500.

II. Popular Rebellions (民亂)

Listing distinctive popular rebellions with class characteristics from the Koryŏ Dynasty:
In the first year of King Sinjong, when the slave Manjŏk (萬積) and five others went to North Mountain (北山) to gather firewood, they gathered public and private slaves and said, "Since the Kyŏng-Kye years (庚癸之際, referring to the military coup period), there have been high officials who came from lowly origins. How could generals and ministers (將相) be born of a different seed? When the time comes, we too can all become officials. Must we forever engage in physical labor and only suffer our masters' beatings?" They pledged to gather at Hŭngguksa Temple (興國寺) on a certain day, kill the powerful minister Ch'oe Ch'unghŏn (崔忠獻) in one stroke, and also for each to kill their respective household masters and burn the slave registers (奴隷의 族籍). On the appointed day, several hundred gathered, but deeming the number insufficient, they agreed to gather again on another day at Pojesa Temple (普濟寺). However, one traitor among them secretly reported the plan, and ultimately Manjŏk and over 100 others were captured and drowned in the Yesŏng River (禮成江). Furthermore, although many others were implicated in this affair, an edict was issued pardoning them. And then, the first popular rebellion since the founding of the state [Yi Dynasty] was the Tonghak Rebellion (東學黨의 亂). The Tonghak Party:
In the last years of King Ch'ŏlchong, a man named Ch'oe Cheu (崔濟愚) from Kyŏngju (慶州) founded Tonghak (東學) and gathered over ten thousand followers. In the first year of King Kojong (李太王), Ch'oe was captured and executed by beheading. However, the oppressive rule (虐政) of that time worsened daily, and Chŏn Pongjun (全奉準) succeeded him and started the movement. Responding figures gathered from various places; Son Ch'ŏnmi (孫天尾) in Ch'ŏngju, Yi Sangok (李祥玉) in Poun (報恩), the entire Three Southern Provinces (三南) boiled like water in a cauldron. Even Chŏnju Castle (全州城) fell. At this time, the court in Seoul requested troops from Qing China (淸國). This ultimately led to the Sino-Japanese War (日淸戰爭).
This rebellion was the largest and sole popular rebellion in Chosŏn initiated by the hands of the people.

**Summary**

This article, written by "Pugaksanin" but attributed to a Mr. Imamura, categorizes historical Korean "internal disturbances" (rebellions, uprisings) into three types based on the leading class: scholar-officials (士亂), commoners (民亂), and bandits (盜亂). It argues that scholar and bandit rebellions are obsolete due to societal changes, while popular rebellions remain a potential future concern. The text then provides historical examples of scholar rebellions from the Koryŏ and Yi Dynasties, including Yi Sŏnggye's founding, various regional uprisings (Yi Chingok, Yi Siae, Yi Kwal, Hong Kyŏngnae), the Gapsin Coup (Kaehwadang), and the Righteous Army uprisings following the army's disbandment in 1907. It briefly introduces popular rebellions, citing the Koryŏ slave revolt led by Manjŏk and identifying the Tonghak Rebellion as the largest popular uprising in Chosŏn history.

From a colonial history perspective, the article is interesting for several reasons. Firstly, its categorization schema and prediction about future "popular rebellions" could reflect contemporary Japanese colonial anxieties about social unrest, communism, and nationalism in Korea. Secondly, the framing of the 1907-1908 anti-Japanese resistance ("明治 41년의 變") as a type of "Scholar Rebellion" (士亂) and the detailed casualty figures (likely from Japanese sources) offer insight into the colonial narrative surrounding these events. Finally, the explicit attribution to a Japanese source (Imamura) highlights the influence of Japanese scholarship on interpretations of Korean history published for Korean audiences during this period. Historians might find the article's typology, its selective historical examples, and its underlying perspective reflective of colonial-era discourse on Korean social structure and political instability.

朝鮮內亂의 社會的 考察
						北岳山人
一. 內亂의 種類
여기에 內亂이라 稱함은 現行刑法의 內亂罪에 該當하는 것을 말함은 勿論 좀더 意味를 넓혀서 凶徒聚集에서부터 政治上의 陰謀殺戮 近代의 共産黨事件 學校事件에 至하기까지 무엇이든지 內亂의 卵種이라 볼 團體的으로 社會의 粉訌을 惹起하는 것을 모다 통떠러서 說述하기로 한다.
內亂種別을 이를 企劃한 主謀者의 社會階級으로 보아서 大體로 左의 3種에 區別할 수 잇다.
1. 士亂 卽 兩班이 主謀者가 되어 中心勢力이 된 것.
2. 民亂 人民이 主謀者가 되어서 또는 그 大勢力이 된 것.
3. 盜亂 盜賊이 主謀者가 된 것.
高麗朝, 李朝 모다 朝鮮의 國質上 王權은 그러케 떨치지 못하엿다. 兩朝의 太祖와 가치 偉大한 政治家가 在位한 때는 別問題로 하고 其他의 時代에는 王權의 基礎가 動搖하여 內亂이 頻繁하엿다.
그런데 時代의 趨勢로 하야 오늘날에 이르러는 第1의 士亂과 第3의 盜亂은 發生의 根源이 毁滅하엿기 때문에 跡을 絶하고 將來에는 第2의 民亂的 方面이 이러날 憂慮 잇다면 그러하리라. 以下에 前記3種의 爭亂의 大體歷史를 列叙하고 나종에 그의 特質을 闡明코저 한다.

二. 士亂

士亂의 形式에도 種種 잇다.
第1, 堂堂히 兵力으로써 싸우는 것.
第2, 兵權을 背後의 威力으로 하고 王의 更立을 計劃하며 그리고 更立한 뒤는 自己便의 王을 立하려는 것.
第3, 政治的 陰謀로써 王의 更立이나 또는 그 때의 權勢者를 너머트리고 自己가 此에 代하려하는 것.
高麗朝의 녯적부터 前記 1, 2, 3 모다 士亂은 恒常 끗치지 안엇다. 그 가운데 第1 큰 것은 仁宗때에 僧 妙淸이 分司侍郞의 趙匡이며 司宰少卿의 趙昌言등과 相謀하여 平壤을 本據로 하고 叛한 것과 元宗時 將軍의 裵仲孫이 三別抄의 軍을 引率하고 全羅에 叛한 것이 第1 大規模의 것이요. 이때에는 中外가 震慄하고 그 討伐에 잇서서도 數次나 大軍을 움지기엇스나 容易히 鎭定되지 안엇스나 乃終에 官兵 때문에 討滅이 되기는 하엿다.
李朝大祖 李成桂의 革命도 또한 第1, 第2, 第3을 兼行한 것이나 太祖의 實力, 德望, 天時, 人心을 어듬으로써 일을 成功한 것이다. 結局 高麗朝는 貴族專權惡政의 自家中毒에 의하야 傾斜衰退하여 早晩武臣의 손에 國名이 歸할 運命에 잇섯든 것이다.
李朝中 第1 種에 該當하는 것을 列擧하면
1. 端宗 2년 李澄玉의 亂. 이것은 李澄玉이가 咸吉道節制使時에 京城에서 世祖가 端宗을 廢立하엿다. 政變을 아는 同時에 自己代身에 온 朴好問을 죽이고 一擧에 兵을 이르키어 北進하여 豆滿江을 건너서 金의 舊都 五國城에 據하야 人民을 隨하야 大金皇帝가 되어 朝鮮을 치려하엿스나 그 中途鍾城府使의 謀略에 드러 暗殺되엇다.
2. 世祖 13년 李施愛의 亂. 李施愛는 元來 會寧府使를 한 爲人으로 道內에서 擧兵하여 咸鏡道節度使康孝文과 吉州＜25＞ 牧師 薛澄新을 죽이고 吉州에서 叛하엿다. 北道는 거지반 그의 手中에 歸하엿다. 그때는 中外 人心이 洶洶하야 6道 兵3萬을 가지고 겨우 平定하엿다. 이때에는 서울에도 內應者가 잇서 形勢에 의하여는 內外 呼應하려고 한 것이엇다.
3. 仁祖 2년 李适의 亂. 李适은 仁祖反正時 功이 第1이어야 올흘 것을 仁祖가 光海君을 쫏고 卽後에 論功行賞할 때 兵曹判書가 될 것이라고 自他가 許하엿든 바 그만 第2位로 내려가 平安兵使에 任命되서 外方에 가게 되자 不滿을 품고 兵을 擧하여 서울에 드러와 臨時政府를 組織까지 하엿스나 入京 3일후 官軍에게 破함이 되어 屍口門으로부터 敗走하엿다. 그 뒤 이틀만에 잡히어 斬首의 刑을 당하엿다.
4. 仁祖 5년 李仁居의 亂 - 李仁居는 橫城에 잇서 時事에 不平을 품고 光海君을 復位하려고 하여 橫城縣監을 捕縛하고 囚徒를 釋放한 뒤 兵器을 빼앗고서 上京하려 하엿스나 原州牧師 때문에 討伐이 되엇다. 이때에도 서울에는 內應者가 잇섯다고 한다.
5. 英祖 4년 李麟佐의 亂 - 李麟佐는 처음 淸州兵營에 入하야 兵使를 죽이고 스사로 大元師라 稱한 뒤 上京하려하다가 中途에서 官事 때문에 討滅이 되엇다.
6. 純祖 11년의 洪景來 亂 - 洪景來는 龍岡縣의 사람으로 李朝가 西北人材를 登用하지 안는데 不平을 품고 革命을 圖謀하고저 嘉山, 郭山의 採金鑛人夫와 其他 不平分子를 모아 兵을 擧하야 嘉山, 郭山, 博川, 泰川, 定州를 破하고 宣川에 入하엿스나 官軍에 破하엿다. 此亂은 실로 京城까지 震駭식히어 그 討滅에 2개월을 要하엿다.
7. 李太王 21년 開化黨의 變 - 이때의 變은 事大黨과 開化黨의 政爭에 基因하야 金玉均, 朴泳孝 등이 事大黨을 넘어트리려고 郵政局 落成式을 機會로 擧事하엿스나 日本公使의 退却으로 開化黨의 亡命에 끄치고 말엇다.
8. 明治 41년의 變 - 海牙密使事件에 의한 李太王의 讓位, 日本에 兵權의 委任등으로 反日本氣勢가 크게 떨치어 兵隊의 解散을 動機로 하고 京城에서 軍隊의 一隊가 變을 이르킨 것이 動因이 되어 全國이 響應히여버리중주리가치 各處에 變이 이러낫다.
日本軍隊와 憲兵과 警察官에게 討伐되엇는데 鎭定까지에 5개월의 時日을 要하엿고 朝鮮人 死傷 1,250명 日本人 120명 被燒家屋 6,800戶, 憲兵警察官의 戰死가 朝鮮人 52명, 日本人 127명, 負傷 日本人 352명 朝鮮人 25명, 變을 이르킨 側의 死傷은 14,500명에 及하엿다.

二. 民亂
高麗朝에 잇서서 階級性을 띈 特異한 民亂을 列擧하여보면
神宗元年에 奴隷의 萬積 등 여섯 사람이 北山으로 나무하려 갓슬 때에 公私의 奴隷을 招集하여 말하기를 國家庚癸의 때이래 高官도 賤民으로부터 出身한 자가 잇다. 將相이란 엇지 씨가 다른 것이랴. 때가 오면 우리들도 모다 官吏가 된다. 吾等은 언제까지든지 筋肉勞働에 從事하고 主人의 매만 마즐 것이랴. 아모아모날 興國寺 절간에 모여 一擧에 權臣인 崔忠獻을 죽이고 또한 제각기 집 상전을 죽이어 奴隷의 族籍을 불태 버리기를 約하엿다. 그날에 이르러 모히는 者가 數百名 이것만으로는 수효가 不足타고 다시 아모날 普濟寺에 모히기를 約束하엿다. 그러나 그 가운데 한명의 背反者가 잇서 이일을 密告하여 끗끗내 萬積등 百餘名이 捕縛되어 禮成江에 沈殺식히엇다. 더욱 이일에 加擔한 者가 多數하엿스나 詔하여 不問에 부치로 하엿다. 그러고는 開國 以來 民亂으로서 最初의 것은 東學黨의 亂이엇다. 東學黨은
哲宗王의 未年 慶州의 崔濟愚라는 爲人이 東學을 創하고 그 敎徒 十數萬을 모으게 되엇다. 李太王 元年에 崔은 잡히어 斬刑되엇스나 그때의 虐政이 日甚하야 全奉準이 後繼하야 일을 이르켯다. 이에 各地 響應하는 사람이 만허서 孫天尾는 淸州에서 李祥玉은 報恩에서 三南 上下는 솟가마의 물가치 크게 끌엇다. 全州城까지 陷落되엇다. 이때 서울의 朝廷은 兵을 淸國에 請하엿다. 이에 日淸戰爭에까지 이르고 만 것이다.
이 亂은 人民의 손으로 이르킨 朝鮮 最大 且 唯一의 民亂이엇다.
