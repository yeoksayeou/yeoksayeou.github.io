A Voyage Log to Shanghai and Vladivostok Aboard an Old Korean Warship
Konggok Kŏsa

1.  Vladivostok's Street Girls
My companion, the operetta performer Mr. H, urged me on in Japanese mixed with a Kyūshū accent, suggesting we venture into the "federal ero[tic]" scene. It wasn't entirely disagreeable, so we two young foreign sailors boldly set out to hunt for street girls. It sounds rather blunt, but it reminds me of when my respected friend L went on a trip to Antung County (安東縣) the other day. Mr. K there offered generous hospitality, taking him to a brothel, unaware that L was like a stone Buddha. L, not knowing where he was being taken, realized upon arrival. However, being unfamiliar with such social outings, he felt uncomfortable but went in. After returning from Antung County, L, despite not having "succeeded" (which from my perspective is a frustrating thing), couldn't stop praising the beauty of Chinese women. Readers, imagine how much allure foreign beauties exude towards the patrons who seek them out there. If, from the essay written below, you detect the fragrant aroma of erotic OO, it is due to my poor writing, not because the color of erotic beauty isn't strong, as the episode of the stone-Buddha Mr. Im proves.
The main streets around the Japanese Consulate General in Vladivostok are all haunts for street girls. In the deep of night, as snow flutters down, they lean against utility poles, seeking their partners for the night from the passersby. When they spot customers who look Japanese, wearing Western clothes and hats, they call out, "Moshi moshi, Nihonjin? Yoroshii arimasu ka?" (Hello, Japanese? Would you like company?), sending flirtatious glances in the old style, or "hits" (잇트) exceeding Clara Bow's (쿠라라보-) in the new style.<61>
Coming down the hill from Beolnichasikka(?), Mr. H and I met two Russian beauties. We managed a conversation using a jumble of Japanese, Russian, and Chinese. Saying "Aigo, it's cold, it's cold," we were led to their apartment, but less than three minutes later, we returned to our ship moored at the Free Pier. Why? Without their hats, they looked to be at least 50 years old.

Two Episodes Experienced in Vladivostok
The gun batteries buried here and there around Golden Horn Bay (金角灣頭), relics of the Imperialist Russian era, were desolate like abandoned houses. On the barracks and warehouses, faint traces of paint revealed letters like "Xth Division Attached Warehouse," remnants from the Japanese army's Siberian Intervention. Generally speaking, the Vladivostok I saw was a desolate Vladivostok. One Japanese Yen could be exchanged for 360 Russian Kopecks. It was around the time when the Chōsen Bank's Vladivostok branch (鮮銀浦鹽支店), then facing closure debates, became the Chōsen Bank's sole money-making branch. The streets were full of beggars, goods were scarce, and at the bread distribution centers (麵麭配給所), hundreds, even thousands, lined up to receive a few pieces of black bread. Even considering it was Russia in transition, this sight was undoubtedly astonishing to observers. However, there was also a joy that seemed to promise a future; that is, the young Russians showed vigorous energy and lively movements in their faces. As my duties limited my interactions mostly to port officials, customs officers, and the like—a confined group of young people—those adhering to OO-ism might call this biased. A certain XX passenger who went to Vladivostok years ago on the Tonp'o liaison ship *Kagi Maru* (嘉義丸) recounted how a Korean official there handled baggage inspection and travel documents with fluent X-language, treating him particularly harshly. That same Mr. K, knowing I was the only Korean senior officer on foreign ships entering and leaving Vladivostok (浦鹽), never said a word beyond his official duties. I cannot describe how pleased I was by this. If it had been an official from another country, they would have asked all sorts of questions. Seeing him, I thought, "Does one become like that when pushed to the extreme?" and remembered the Hamgyŏng Province proverb, "If you're going to die anyway, die by the dagger," feeling quite glad. Let me tell another story about Koreans from a different perspective. When the Provincial Governor Mr. P boarded the F-Maru (F丸), the ship I was on, ostensibly to inspect the Worker-Peasant Russian administrative system in C Port (C港), he brought along an attendant named OX. Seeing him confidently sign his passport in English, I had expectations. After landing in Vladivostok, he was very busy attending banquets hosted by various Soviet government offices and the consulate. I don't recall which banquet it was exactly, but Captain H and I attended one held at the Tokiwa Hotel (常盤ホテル), run by Japanese there, as accompanying guests. At that time, Governor P gave a speech, saying, "Hearing that there are over three hundred of our compatriots in Vladivostok, I don't feel like I'm in a foreign country at all." As he spoke in his less-than-fluent language, I thought of the aforementioned Mr. K and wondered why this man was so insignificant, staring at him blankly for a while.

How Many Koreans Hold Seaman's Certificates?
How many Koreans hold certificates to become senior officers? Speaking in the manner of a grieving and indignant patriotic X activist, one might loudly lament, "Are the descendants of Yi Sunsin (李舜臣), who created the Turtle Ship (龜船), reduced to this?" If we assume the *Kwangje-maru* (光濟丸), which I sailed on, operated in coastal waters under the old maritime law, its saloon and senior officers' quarters still clearly bear T'aegŭk (太X) carvings. However, to operate it under Japanese maritime law, there are no qualified Korean senior officers, i.e., certificate holders, to run it. Listing the senior officers from my memory might be <62> uninteresting and lengthy for the readers, but currently, there is Mr. Yu Tong-nyŏl (劉東烈君), a graduate of Tokyo Kōtō Shōsen Gakkō (東京高商船) who probably holds a Class A Captain's license; Mr. Pak Man-sŏ (朴萬緖씨), a Class B Captain who served as captain of the *Yangmu-ho* (楊武號) and *Hyŏnik-ho* (顯益號), a Class A-1 person who received a hefty retirement allowance from Chōsen Yusen (朝郵) and is said to be running a brewery; old Mr. Kim Sŏng-jin (金聲振老人) in Pusan, who saw the final curtain fall on Hyŏptong Yusen (協同郵船) and served as captain of the *Kōju-maru* (幸壽丸); besides them, a Mr. An (安某) as a 2nd Mate, and another Mr. An (安某) as a 2nd Engineer—about 10 people in total. It's true that we lack workers in various fields, whether in ideology or enterprise, but there's no field as lacking in personnel as the maritime industry.
Currently, there is a route between Ōsaka and Cheju Island (濟州島) operated by the Tōa Tsūkō Kumiai (東亞通航組合). However, it is a constant worry, perhaps unfounded anxiety (杞憂), that there are few on land with experience in the shipping industry and no senior officers at sea to command those ships.

Romance of the Sea

Before the Hamgyŏng Northern Line (咸鏡北部線) was opened, the K-Maru (K丸), on which I worked, served as a liaison ship between Wŏnsan (元山) and Ch'ŏngjin (淸津), making round trips from Wŏnsan every four days. It must have been around the 15th of March, when the colors of spring were deepening. Since before steamships existed in Chosŏn, boatmen considered the capes Musu-kkŭt (舞水끗) in Myŏngch'ŏn (明川) and Taegang-kkŭt (대강끗) in Yŏnghŭng (永興) perilous places where the waves swirled. Ships passing through here would prepare food and drink before leaving their home port and sincerely perform rites (고사). Later, when steamships began plying these waters, dense fog and numerous hidden reefs led to frequent maritime accidents, making it a place dreaded by all. Around three o'clock on a deep night, as the K-Maru was passing Musu Point (舞水端), the telegraph connecting the bridge to the engine room suddenly rang loudly and frantically. This signal is used by the captain to order the chief engineer for full speed, slow, forward, or reverse when entering or leaving port. Hearing the telegraph ring so violently in the middle of the night, I thought, "Oh no, something terrible has happened!" and jumped up. Just then, there was a knock on the door (도아-). "What is it?" I answered in a frightened voice. The steward on duty reported that a second-class passenger had jumped overboard.
Going up to the deck, six Chinese soldiers (淸國兵丁) stood trembling, their rifles slung upside down. That morning at 10 o'clock, when leaving C Port, the head of the Water Police (水上署部長) had earnestly requested special care, explaining that the passenger was the wife of a high-ranking Chinese official in Jiandao (間島) suffering from extreme nervous exhaustion, being sent back to her family home. He said that although six soldiers were accompanying her, he wasn't reassured and asked for a steward to be assigned duty as well. That young and beautiful lady, whom we had been asked to look after, had jumped overboard. Why? A soldier, likely a sergeant, who accompanied her to protect his master's wife, spoke in a frightened and sad tone, his words jumbled with fear of being beheaded upon returning to his homeland and sympathy from understanding his master's situation. "Mama is the daughter of a high official in Fengtian (奉天). She is the wife of our superior officer in the North Jiandao (北間島) region, similar to a police chief in Chosŏn. Mama graduated early from a mission school in Tianjin (天津) and married him at the tender age of 18. For about two years, their marital harmony was exceptional, and they were widely praised as a truly happy pair of mandarin ducks. But then, by chance, he met another beauty and started down the path trodden by high Chinese officials, taking mistresses 1, 2, 3. Furthermore, the O-country beauty wished to monopolize him, so His Excellency the Master did not visit the first wife (큰마마) even once a year. This became the reason Mama attempted to hang herself in the garden behind the official residence but was discovered before succeeding, and so she was being sent back to her family home. What should we do?" he pleaded with me. Perhaps she recalled the sweet life before 'Mama' came into existence, and hating the world that held only 28 years of sorrow, she chose to die even far from her homeland, sinking into the foreign sea? Is there truly a border in human feelings (人情)? The captain and all crew members searched with all their might for over an hour and observed a moment of silence for her.

**Summary**

This memoir installment by "Konggok Kŏsa" recounts his experiences as a Korean sailor aboard a former Korean warship traveling to Vladivostok in the early 1930s. He describes the desolate atmosphere of the city, encounters with Russian street girls, interactions with a stoic Korean official working under the Soviets, and contrasts this with the behavior of a visiting Korean provincial governor under Japanese rule. A significant portion reflects on the dire lack of qualified Korean senior mariners, invoking Yi Sunsin and the *Kwangje-maru*, despite Korea's maritime history. The piece concludes with a tragic anecdote about the suicide of a Chinese official's young wife at sea near Musu Point. From a historical perspective, the article offers valuable glimpses into the conditions in Vladivostok during the early Soviet period, the complex positions and attitudes of Koreans under different regimes (Soviet, Japanese colonial), the severe limitations faced by Koreans in professional fields like the maritime industry under Japanese rule, and cross-cultural interactions and tragedies in the region. The lament over the lack of Korean sailors highlights the impact of colonialism on national capabilities and aspirations.

						空谷居士
1. 海參威의 스츄릿껄들
同行인 오페레타 H君이 연방에로로 進出하자고 九州사투리 석긴 日本말로 口味을 도드는데 그다지 실치도 압어서 두 젊은 異國마도로쓰는 大膽하게도 스트릿껄산양에 착수햇다. 말이 가투다러나 未安하나 筆者의 畏友 L君이 前日 安東縣에 旅行하여슬 때 그 곳 K氏가 厚히 待接한다는 것이 돌부천임인 줄도 모르고 개판쓰로 대리고 갓슴니다. 어듸가는지 영문도 모르든 L君은 가고보니 거김니다. 하나 社交에 泛然치 안은 君은 마음에 뜨적하나 드러갓슴니다. 安東縣에 갓다, 도라온 후에 君은 成功치도 못하고 「筆者의 立場으로 본다면 ハガユイ한 일이나」 中華美人의 稱讚이 惹端입니다. 讀者여러분 想像해보시요. 外國美人이 얼마나 그 곳 차저간에 트란체들의게 만흔 잇트를 發散하나 萬若 이 아래 쓴 隨筆에서 香氣芳郁한 에로구로의 OO를 뜻차저내신다면 그는 筆者의 短文所致이지 결코 에로미의 色彩濃厚하지 안타는 것 안임은 돌부처 임君의 에피소드가 證明하는 바외다.
海參威 日本總領事舘을 中心한 四圍의 큰길거리란 거리는 모다 스트릿껄 出沒地點입니다. 눈이 부실부실 나리는 깁흔 밤에 電柱에 依持하여 오고가는 行人중에서 그날밤의 그들 짝을 求함니다. 東洋사람들도 日本냄새나는 洋服과 帽子쓴 손보면 「若シ若シ日本人ヨロシアリマス하고 舊式말이면 秋波 新式말이면 잇트를 쿠라라보-以上으로 보냄니다.＜61＞
벌니차시까 고개를 내려오다가 H君과 나는 두 露西亞美人을 만나 日本語 露語 中語 막 뒤죽박죽 석긴 말로 이야기는 되엿슴니다. 아이 추워추워하고 이 시보시를 모라 그들 아파트로 간 우리들은 3分도 못되여 自由埠頭에 매인 우리 배로 도라왓슴니다. 웨? 帽子버슨 그들은 아마 적어도 50歲는 되엿겟슴니다.

海參威에서 격근 두 가지 에피소드
帝國主義露西亞時代의 遺物인 金角灣頭 여기저기에 파뭇첫던 砲臺는 사람업는 집처럼 荒凉하엿고 兵舍와 倉庫에는 日本軍이 西伯利 出兵時代의 남긴 자취로 第隊附屬倉庫云云의 글자가 히미하게 페인트를 通하여 뵈임니다. 大體로 말하면 내가 본 海參威는 荒凉한 海參威엇슴니다. 日貨1圓이면 露貨360哥를 밧금니다. 閉鎖하느니 마느니하고 問題되든 鮮銀浦鹽支店이 鮮銀唯一의 돈모으는 支店된 것도 그 때 前後이엇슴니다. 거리에는 거지들이 만코 物貨는 缺乏하여 麵麭配給所에는 數百數千의 群象이 列을 지여 멧조가리의 黑麵麭을 바다 가지고 가는 것은 아모리 過渡時期의 露西亞라 하여도 行爲의게 驚異를 줌에는 틀님업섯슴니다. 그러나 거기에는 未來를 約束한 듯한 깃붐 다시 말하면 젊은 露西亞사람들 낫에는 씩씩한 기운과 活潑한 動作이 보이더이다. 筆者는 職務上 港務局官吏 稅關吏 깨뵈등 局限된 一部의 젊은이만 보앗스니 OO主義의 분들은 偏見이라 할넌지 모르나. 年前 敦浦連絡船嘉義丸타고 海參威갓든 某XX人客의 朝鮮人 官吏의 流暢한 X語로 行具檢査와 旅行券에 대하여 類달니 苛酷이 取扱하드라는 旅行談에 말하엿던 그 K君이 筆者가 浦鹽出入하는 外國船에 唯一한 朝鮮人高級船員인줄 알면서도 職務以外말은 한마듸도 하지안는 것은 엇더케 반가운지 몰넛슴니다. 그것이 다른 나라 官吏라면 온갓 말 다- 물을 것인데 사람도 처일데 치이면 저러케 되나하고 「차라리 죽겟스면 장도에 마저 죽어라」하는 感鏡道속담이 생각케 되면서 퍽이나 깃벗슴니다. 우에 이야기와 다른 方面으로 본 朝鮮人이야기 한나 쓰겟슴니다. 내가 탄 F丸이 C港에서 그 道知事P氏가 勞農露西亞 行政制度를 視察하려 가시라는 名目下에 乘 船하섯슴니다. OX이란 屬官한 분 대리시고 파스포트에 英語싸인 독독이 하시는 것 보고 속으로는 期待햇슴니다. 海參威 上陸以後 그는 소뵈에트 各官廳과 領事舘의 宴會에 出席하기에 퍽 奔走하섯슴니다. 엇던 宴會가 잘 記憶안되나 그 곳 日本人經營常盤ホテル에서 열닌 宴會에 H船長과 나는 陪賓으로 參禮하엿슴니다. 그 때에 P知事 演說에 海參威에는 우리 同胞가 參百餘名이나 잇다니 外國온 感이 조곰도 업다 하시고 流暢치도 못하신 말로 하실 때에 前記 K君을 聯想하고 웨 저-는 저다지 적을가 하고 한참동안 물그럼이 그를 처다보앗슴니다.

朝鮮사람의 海員免狀受有者는 멧치나 되나?
朝鮮人으로 高級船員될 免狀受有者는 멧이나 되나? 悲憤感慨의 愛X志士式으로 말한다면 龜船을 創造한 李舜臣의 後裔로 이럴데 잇나하고 高聲叫號할 터임니다. 내가 타든 光濟丸을 舊海商法으로 近海을 航行한다 假定하면 그 배에는 尙今도사룬과 高級船員室에는 太X彫刻이 두럿이 잇슴에도 不拘하고 日本海商法으로 運轉하자면 朝鮮人으로 이것 運轉할 高級船員 卽有資格者가 업슴니다. 筆者의 記憶올 그대로 高級船員一名을 적어보면 讀者의게는＜62＞ 興味업는 퍽 長蝗한 일이나 至今은 甲種船長免狀 가저슬 東京高商船出身인 劉東烈君 乙種船長으로 楊武號船長 顯益號船長으로 甲種一人으로 朝郵에서 退職手當 그득히 바더가지고 釀酒所한다는 朴萬緖씨 協同郵船의 最後의 幕을 닷게하고 幸壽丸船長노릇하든 釜山잇는 金聲振老人 그外 2等 運轉士로 安某 2等機關士 安某하고 10名內外임니다. 思想 企業 어느 方面이던지 우리는 일군이 적은 것은 事實이나 海運界처럼 사람업는데도 업슴니다.
至今 大阪濟州島間에 東亞通航組合 손으로 經營하는 航路잇스나 陸으로는 海運業에 經驗잇는 이 적고 바다에는 그배를 操縱할 高級船員업스미 杞憂인지 모르나 恒常 念慮되는 點임니다.

바다의 로만쓰

咸鏡北部線이 아직 開通되지 안을 때 筆者가 勤務하는 K丸은 元山淸津間 連絡船으로 元山을 四日隔하여 往復하엿슴니다. 때는 바야흐로 春色이 무르녹은 3月보름적인가 봄니다. 汽船이 아직 朝鮮에 업슬 때부터 배沙工들은 永興대강끗 明川舞水끗하고 물결이 소용둘친다 하여 이 곳 거처 來往하는 배는 母港을 出帆할 때 미리 準備하엿던 飮食物을 가추어 가지고 至誠 것 고사지내는 험한 곳이오, 그후 汽船이 來往하게되자 雲霧가 濃厚하게 끼고 暗礁가 만으니 거기 따른 海難事故가 頻繁하여 딱 疾色하는 곳임니다. 그 때 K丸이 이 舞水端을 지나는 깁흔 밤 세시쯤된 때 船橋에서 機關室로 통한 테레그랍이 惶怯하게도 요란하게 울니운다. 이 信號는 港口에 出入할 때 機關의 全速力, 徐行, 前進, 後退의 命令을 船長이 機關長의게 하는 信號機인 때 이 테레그랍이 안인 밤중에 요란하게, 아차 클 일낫구나 하고 벌덕 일어나니 벌서 도아-를 노크하는 소리 웨하고 겁난 목소리로 對答하니 當直 給仕가 2等船客이 投身하엿다는 報告.
甲板에 올너가니 淸國兵丁이 여섯이나 銃을 갓구로 메고 벌벌 덜고 잇슴니다. 그날 아침 열시 C港떠날 때 水上署部長이 間島中國高官夫人인데 極度의 神經衰弱으로 親家에 보낸다. 兵丁이 여섯이나 잇스나 安心안되니 給仕도 當直식켜 달나고 懇曲하게 附托바든 젊고 어엿분 그 美人이 投身 웨? 主人保護하려 同行하던 下士格의 軍人이 故國도라가면 목나러갈 念慮 主人의 事情을 잘알어 同情하는 마음 서로 錯雜하여 겁나가 슬픈 語調로 마마는 奉天 某大官따님으로 北間島某地方朝鮮의 警察部長갓혼 우리 上官의 夫人인데 마마께서는 일즉 天津某밋순 수쿨을 卒業하고 芳紀 18歲에 그의게 시집갓슴니다. 限 2년동안은 남달리 琴瑟이 相和하여 참 幸福된 鴛鴦이 稱頌이 자자하엿슴니다. 그러던 것이 偶然한 機會에 엇던 美人과 만나자 그는 1, 2, 3號하고 淸國高官이 밥는 길을 발벗슴니다. 더욱 O國美人은 그를 獨占하고 십허하여 큰마마의게는 主人閣下께서 1년에 한차레도 찻지 안엇슴니다. 그것이 原因되여 마마께서 官舍後園에서 縊首自殺하려다가 發覺되여 뜻을 못이르고 親家로 가게 되엿슴니다. 엇지면 좃슴니가하고 나의게 하소연한다. 아마 그는 마마가 아직 생기기전에 달큼하게 살든 過去을 追憶하면서 28이란 恨만흔 世上을 죽는데까지 故國을 실타하고 外國바다속에 빠서죽엇나? 莫遮 人情에 國境이 잇스랴 船長以下 모든 船員은 一時間 以上 全力을 다하야 搜査하여 보앗고 한참동안 그를 위해 黙禱도 하여주엇다.
