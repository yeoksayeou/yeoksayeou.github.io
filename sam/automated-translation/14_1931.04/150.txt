Lighting Up a Cigarette

The Government-General (總督府), having decided to start a public works project for the relief of the poor (窮民救濟의 土木事業) by throwing in 65 million won, says it will enforce savings (强制貯蓄) of about 10 percent of the wages for the sake of the so-called workers' stable livelihood (恒産). If only one had the "freedom of use," one would want to save all 65 million won, one would want them to save it all.

There's a characteristic feature in Chosŏn's various newspapers. It's the fact that medicine advertisements (賣藥廣告) occupy 80 percent of the space. Namely, syphilis medicine, gonorrhea medicine, tuberculosis medicine, aphrodisiacs... If foreigners saw this, they would think all Koreans are venereal disease patients (花柳病者). Advertising fees are precious, but the nation's dignity (體面) is more precious. A point for the newspaper authorities (新聞當局者) to deeply reflect upon (猛省).

A rapid increase in graduates means a rapid increase in the unemployed; a rapid increase in the unemployed means a rapid increase in disgruntled people (不平客); a rapid increase in disgruntled people means a rapid increase in bars; thus, is it a rapid increase in venereal disease? Does this mean schools are manufacturing venereal disease<46> then? Haha! What a strange world (別世上)!

Due to hardship of living (生活難), there are four divorce suits (離婚訴) per day in Sŏul. Even "love" is controlled by "grains of food (穀食알)." It's a case of a dead Zhuge Liang scaring away a living Sima Yi (死孔明이 走生仲達格).

Regarding the statement in the previous issue's column (本欄), "Principals and teachers, too, have their fate tied to the 108 prayer beads (108念珠). It's a sad state for the commercialization of education (敎育의 企業化)," etc. (云云), it is retracted (取消) as there are some who misunderstand (誤解) it.

I'd gain weight if I hadn't seen three things: A "mother (오머니)" carrying a Japanese person's child (X人아해) on her back in the streetcar (電車); the strange characters (怪文字) of a North Street shop (北街商店) saying "學用品一切揃" [School Supplies All Available - Japanese]; a country bumpkin (村夫子) standing mouth agape in front of a Japanese department store (X人百貸店). Phew, I'm breaking out in a sweat.

Five Marriages, Four Divorces
An American youth "Chon" and an American woman "Meiya-" divorced four times after becoming husband and wife once. They separated and remarried. Separated again. Remarried again. - That is:
In 1909, the two married. In 1911, they finally divorced.
In 1912, regretting the divorce, they remarried. In 1913, saying it wasn't fun no matter what, they divorced again.
In 1915, they remarried again and registered (登錄) at the court (裁判所), pledging not to separate this time. In 1919, saying the 4 years of married life were meaningless (無意味), they divorced again.
In 1920, they registered (登記) their marriage for the fourth time. In 1926, they resolutely (斷然) divorced.
Then, they supposedly remarried again just the other day (요일전에). A world record. <47>

**Summary**

This column from the April 1931 issue of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine presents a series of cynical observations on contemporary Korean society under Japanese rule. It comments on the Government-General's public works project and forced savings, criticizes the prevalence of venereal disease medicine ads in newspapers as damaging to national dignity, links unemployment among graduates to social problems like drinking and disease, notes the rise in divorces due to economic hardship, retracts a previous statement about the commercialization of education, expresses disgust at scenes symbolizing colonial influence (Japanese children, awkward Japanese signage, Koreans gawking at Japanese stores), and ends with an anecdote about an American couple's repeated marriages and divorces. The piece reflects anxieties about economic hardship, social decay, unemployment, the impact of Japanese colonialism on Korean society and identity, and a general sense of disillusionment. For historians, the article offers insights into social commentary during the colonial period, concerns about public health representation, graduate unemployment, the perceived influence of Japanese culture and economy, and everyday observations reflecting colonial realities. The critique of newspaper advertising content and the mention of forced savings associated with colonial public works are particularly notable.

담배한대 피어물고
6천5백만원을 던지어 窮民救濟의 土木事業을 起工하기로 決定한 總督府에서는 所謂 勞働者의 恒産을 위한다고 그 工賃의 一割 可量을 强制貯蓄 식히리라고, 언제든지 「使用의 自由」만 잇다면 6천 5백만원을 다 貯蓄하고 십흔 일, 貯蓄케 하고 십흔 일.

朝鮮의 各 新聞에 特色이 잇다. 賣藥廣告가 八割을 占領한 事實이 그것이다. 曰 梅毒藥, 痳疾藥, 肺病藥, 性興奮藥, 外國사람이 보면 朝鮮人은 모다 花柳病者라고 할 일, 廣告料도 貴하나 民族의 體面은 더 貴하다. 新聞當局者의 猛省할 곳.

卒業生의 激增은 즉 失業者의 激增, 失業者의 激增은 즉 不平客의 激增, 不平客의 激增은 즉 술집의 激增, 이래서 花柳病의 激增인가. 그러면 學校가 花柳病을 製造하는＜46＞ 세음인가. 呵呵 別世上!

生活難으로 離婚訴가 서울서 하로에 네件 「사랑」도 「穀食알」이 操縱. 死孔明이 走生仲達格.

지난 號 本欄에 「校長도 敎師도 108念珠에 그목이 달렷다. 敎育의 企業化로는 애닯은 일」云云한 事實은 誤解하는 이가 잇기에 取消한다.

세가지를 보지 말엇스면 살이 지겟다. 電車속에서 X人아해 업은 「오머니」, 「學用品一切揃」이란 北街商店의 怪文字, X人百貸店에 입을 하- 버리고 선 村夫子, 에이 땀이 난다.
