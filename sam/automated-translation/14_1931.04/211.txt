Company Announcement

Many people are looking for issues of this magazine (本誌) since the inaugural issue (創刊號), but the few copies remaining at our company (本社) are as follows (如左), so please send payment in advance (先金) and place your order.

Shōwa 4, September Issue (1929)
Shōwa 5, January Issue (1930)
Shōwa 5, April Issue (1930)
Shōwa 5, October Issue (1930)
Shōwa 5, November Issue (1930)
Shōwa 6, February Issue (1931)

Especially, as the February, Shōwa 6 (1931) issue was filled (滿載) with articles on the Singanhoe dissolution problem (新幹解消問題), there have been many subsequent orders (推後注文), so we have reprinted it (增刊). Those who need it, please place your order.<60>

**Summary**

This is a company announcement from the magazine *Samch'ŏlli* listing available back issues from 1929 to 1931. It notes that the February 1931 issue, which heavily featured articles on the dissolution of the *Singanhoe*, was in high demand and had been reprinted due to subsequent orders. Historians might find this interesting as it explicitly links magazine sales and reprinting decisions to coverage of a significant political event (the dissolution of the *Singanhoe*, a major nationalist united front organization), highlighting the public interest in such matters during the colonial period.
