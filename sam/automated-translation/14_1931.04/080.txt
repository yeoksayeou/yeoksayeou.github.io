**Body Text Translation:**
In the reception room (應接室) of the Dong-A Ilbo Company (東亞日報社), there was a hanging scroll (掛軸) with a good meaning. The text says:

Tongue worn, lips parched, expending bitter words
Morning after morning, awakening one's own soul
Look closely at the meaning of each character, each line
These are not ink stains (煤痕), they are blood stains (血痕)

- Mūjin year (戊辰), 67-year-old elder (叟), Sŏkche (石齊)-<31>

**Summary**

The article describes a hanging scroll displayed in the reception room of the Dong-A Ilbo newspaper company. It presents the classical Chinese poem written on the scroll by a 67-year-old elder named Sŏkche in the Mūjin year (likely 1928). The poem powerfully conveys the arduous and painful process of expressing difficult truths, likening the ink used to blood, signifying deep sincerity and sacrifice. For historians, this short piece offers a glimpse into the cultural milieu of a prominent Korean institution during the colonial period. The choice of poem, emphasizing the cost of 'bitter words', could be interpreted as a subtle reflection on the challenges and potential dangers faced by Korean journalists and intellectuals expressing themselves under Japanese colonial rule, making the scroll's presence in the newspaper office particularly poignant.
