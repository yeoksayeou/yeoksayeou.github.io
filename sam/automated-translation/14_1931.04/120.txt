**Summary**

This article from the April 1931 issue of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine features a collection titled "Jokes," containing two short humorous anecdotes about marriage, a list comparing the speeds of various animals and machines (including military aircraft), and details about the family of the recently deceased Manchurian warlord Chang Tso-lin. The jokes offer a glimpse into social humor of the time, while the speed list reflects contemporary interest in technology and nature. The section on Chang Tso-lin provides biographical details presented as straightforward facts. For historians, the article offers insight into the blend of entertainment, general knowledge dissemination, and contemporary affairs coverage in popular Korean magazines during the colonial period, including the specific details presented about a major regional figure like Chang Tso-lin and the types of technology (like military aircraft speeds) considered common knowledge or points of interest.
