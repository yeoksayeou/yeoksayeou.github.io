**Paradox**

Wife: "What is happiness, I wonder?"
Husband: "It's something I felt for the first time after getting married."
Wife: "Do you really think so?"
Husband: "Of course. I think my bachelor days were happiness."

**The Goal**

-"I tell you, once I get a wife, I intend to have it out with the boss and demand a salary sufficient to support a household."
-"Eh? There's no way he'll listen to that."
-"Why not? I'm negotiating to marry the boss's daughter."

**Camouflage**

He: "The tip of my nose is red, it looks unsightly..."
Doctor: "Do you drink alcohol?"
He: "I do enjoy it... could that be why?"
Doctor: "Alcohol, yes. Err..."
He: "Do I have to quit drinking? That would be terrible."
Doctor: "No, just stay drunk all the time, so the red nose isn't easily visible."

**Summary**

This article presents three short, unrelated jokes typical of the era. The first plays on the irony of marital happiness, the second on a clever (or perhaps foolish) plan to secure a better salary through marriage, and the third offers absurd medical advice for a red nose caused by drinking. From a historical perspective, the jokes offer a glimpse into common social themes and humor styles of 1940s Korea under Japanese rule. They touch upon marriage dynamics, economic concerns (salary negotiation), and social habits (drinking), using simple wordplay and situational irony. The use of Hanja alongside Hangul and the specific vocabulary reflect the linguistic landscape of the time.
