The Incident Reaches its Third Anniversary, Engrave This Day, July 7th, in Your Memory!

Three full years (four changes of seasons) have already passed since the Empire advanced its Imperial forces into over 400 provinces to subjugate the Chongqing Government and the Chiang faction, who obstruct the construction of a new order in Asia and adhere to the creed of accommodating communism and resisting Japan. This coming July 7th marks the 3rd anniversary commemoration. During this time, the million soldiers of the Imperial Army have truly fought well and striven hard, reaching the point where most of the important land and sea areas within the territory of all of China have already been occupied by our forces. In parallel with this, we have assisted the man of justice, Mr. Wang Jingwei, reaching the point where the reorganization and return to the capital of the new government has been realized, thus steadily achieving the objectives of the Holy War. Now, facing this deeply emotional day, we first sincerely mourn the spirits of the Imperial Army officers and soldiers sacrificed <28> due to this Holy War. At the same time, as the Incident is still ongoing, we, the citizens of the home front, must unite even further, and with the spirit of self-annihilation for the public good (滅死奉公), assist the government and the military, hoping that the culmination of this Holy War becomes even more glorious and swift.

Events of the Day
One. All of Korea shall hoist the national flag simultaneously.
Two. Prayer Ceremonies = Shinto shrines shall hold prayer ceremonies for the lasting fortunes of war for the dispatched officers and soldiers. Shinto, Buddhist, and Christian organizations shall hold memorial services for the fallen officers and soldiers, pray for the enhancement of national prestige, and for the lasting fortunes of war for the Imperial Army officers and soldiers.
Three. Labor Service for the Nation = The National Spiritual Mobilization League shall compel all group members throughout Korea to mobilize and perform labor service for the nation.
Four. Consolation and Comfort = Visit and console the bereaved families of soldiers and the wounded and sick officers and soldiers; cooperate with the Military Support League and the National Spiritual Mobilization League to implement various appropriate methods.
Five. Suspension of Entertainment = Except for the national flag song, "Umi Yukaba" (海行かば), and other stirring military songs, voluntarily suspend singing, dancing, and music. (Other details omitted) <29>
<28-29>

**Summary**

This editorial from the Korean magazine *Samch'ŏlli* in July 1940 commemorates the third anniversary of the Second Sino-Japanese War (referred to as "the Incident"). It vehemently promotes the Japanese imperial narrative, justifying the war as a "Holy War" against Chiang Kai-shek's "pro-communist, anti-Japanese" government and celebrating military occupations and the establishment of Wang Jingwei's puppet regime. The article strongly urges Koreans, as "home front citizens," to demonstrate unwavering loyalty and support for Japan's war effort through "self-annihilation for the public good," unity, and participation in mandated events like flag hoisting, prayer ceremonies across different religions (Shinto, Buddhism, Christianity) for Japanese victory, compulsory labor service,慰問 activities, and abstaining from entertainment. For historians, this piece starkly reveals the depth of Japanese colonial propaganda and enforced mobilization in Korea during wartime, demanding complete ideological alignment and active participation in the Japanese imperial project, coopting even religious institutions for state purposes.
