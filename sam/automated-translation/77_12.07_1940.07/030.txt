**In the Autumn of Many National Affairs, Volunteer Soldiers**
**The Foundation of National Prosperity Lies in the Power of Women**
**By Kurashige Shūzō, Army Major General, Director of the Press Department, Chōsen Army Headquarters**

Recently, the progress of the Empire's national fortunes has been swift and ceaseless, the proclamation of the Imperial Way spreads throughout all of East Asia, and the times are grave and governance is not easy; truly, we are facing an unprecedented <31> juncture in history. At this time, the implementation of the Army Special Volunteer Soldier system, allowing our Peninsula brethren to share the heavy responsibility of national defense, is truly a deeply significant event from the standpoint of national defense and the spirit of *Naissen Ittai* (Japan and Korea as One Body).

Originally, this stemmed from the Sacred Consideration to make our Peninsula compatriots thoroughly embody the essence of being subjects of the Imperial Nation, become one with the homeland (*naichi*), and together gain the glory of confronting the new situation in East and West. It is a gift finally granted by Heaven, achieved through the self-awareness and fervent patriotic devotion of the 23 million compatriots cultivated and nurtured for 30 years since the beginning of Peninsula administration. The Imperial benevolence bestowed upon the people of the Peninsula has become ever more bountiful, and responding to even a ten-thousandth part of this profound Sacred Grace must become a grave duty imposed upon us, the Peninsula compatriots.

Looking back, since the establishment of the volunteer soldier system, officials and students alike have diligently polished each other, embodying His Majesty's Great Will, and built up shining achievements over the past three years. During this time, those who bravely went forth to the front lines, fought valiantly, and finally met honorable deaths in battle, or were wounded, or fell ill while serving, their meritorious deeds dedicated to the great task of *Kōa* (Raising Asia) will forever adorn the pages of history and shine brilliantly for generations as the radiant fruition of *Naissen Ittai*. Among them, the valiant struggles of Superior Privates Yi In-sŏk and Yi Hyŏng-su, which would make even ghosts weep, and their meritorious service in achieving a glorious death in battle as <32> cornerstones of *Kōa*, have evoked unanimous praise and emotion throughout our nation's government and populace. Especially among the youth of the Peninsula, this emotion has turned into cries of loyalty and dying for the country that echo from port to port. Truly, those wishing to become subjects of the Imperial Nation and applying to be volunteer soldiers are rising up fervently, their patriotic devotion growing more intense daily. This is clearly evident in the dramatic surge in the number of applicants during the recent volunteer recruitment.

While this is, of course, due to the consistent enthusiasm of the authorities responsible for this guidance, it is also nothing less than the self-awareness of the Peninsula compatriots who have resolutely stood up amidst the current Holy War as true Imperial subjects, and their burning sincerity. Furthermore, I firmly believe it is owed to the great power of the Peninsula women who have molded and nurtured these outstanding youths.

Without needing to look at the histories of ancient and modern times, when one considers that the foundation of national prosperity invariably rests on the power of that country's women, the great awakening and activity of women not only encourages the officers and men of the Imperial Army and cultivates the seeds of victory, but the beautiful patriotic sentiment shown by women as women of our Imperial Nation immediately permeates the minds of their children, firmly cultivating the consciousness of being Imperial subjects.

Within our Empire, there is an iron-like unity of the entire nation, and the firm self-awareness and <33> spirited activity of the women behind the lines (*jūgo fujin*), worthy of the name "Mothers of the Militant Nation." Because there are trustworthy second-generation Imperial subjects nurtured by these mothers, the entire populace is harmonious and diligent as if one family, achieving victory in every battle. Deeply understanding that the nation's fortune is prosperous and boundless, at this time when the situation grows graver and the volunteer soldier system is being expanded and strengthened, I earnestly pray that the women of the Peninsula will fulfill their great role as radiant, noble mothers and strive to achieve the beautiful fruit of *Naissen Konzen Ittai* (Japan and Korea perfectly merged as one).

**Great Achievements on the Battlefield and in the Barracks**
**By Tagami Hachirō, Army Major General, Director of the Press Department, 20th Division Headquarters**

When the news of the death in battle of Private Yi In-sŏk, the first sacrifice among the special volunteer soldiers, who fell as a flower defending the nation on the continental front, was conveyed, his elderly father, returning from working in the fields, first asked,
"Did my son meet an end worthy of a Japanese soldier?"
Upon hearing of the splendid manner of his death in battle, he smiled and said,
"Did my son serve splendidly?" <34>
It is said that the people gathered there wept upon hearing these words. I believe all of you share the same sentiment as this elderly father of Private Yi In-sŏk.

Since the Manchurian Incident, the sincerity shown by the Peninsula compatriots behind the lines has been extraordinary. Especially since the outbreak of the China Incident, it has been absolute. Amidst that nationalistic passion, the sincerity of the volunteer soldiers, who have emerged representing the Peninsula, is showing brilliant results on the battlefields and in the barracks.

From your understanding families, your sons, your brothers, are continuing their sincere service to the homeland.

Being born a man of the Empire, shouldering a rifle, and serving with utter devotion (*funkotsu saishin*)—there is no greater cherished desire and emotion for a man than this. Your families have sent forth their representatives. While the national spirit and devoted efforts of the volunteers themselves are commendable, your understanding and support, which nurture such feelings in the volunteers and allow them to bravely proceed to their duties, hold an indelible significance and are a great power, I believe. The family is a cooperative unit. I ask that you support your representatives more strongly, more beautifully, more purely. Observing the yearly increase in special volunteers and their growth into splendid Imperial soldiers, <35> I cannot suppress feelings of deep emotion and gratitude.

Japan is now undertaking the great work of *Kōa* (Raising Asia). It is giving birth to a new Asia. It aims to bring forth world welfare based on East Asian peace. We are all, without exception, sharers of that responsibility. We must advance with loyalty, cooperate with mutual affection to strengthen our unity, endure hardship and train ourselves, and strive to promote the Imperial Way.

**May They Reach Hundreds of Thousands, Millions**
**By Yun Ch'i-ho, Chairman of the Chōsen Volunteer Soldier Support Association**

To the mothers and sisters of Chōsen, at this time of national exigency, there is one thing I earnestly wish to say: you have sent your precious sons and brothers out as soldiers, for which I am truly grateful. It has been barely three years since the volunteer soldier system was implemented, and already this year the number of applicants throughout Chōsen is about to surpass 100,000—where could there be happier news than this?

I know this is all because you, born as mothers and sisters of Chōsen, have not only raised your children well普段 (usually) but have recently come to deeply understand how the world situation is unfolding, and your noble hearts, moved by love for the country, have brought this about.

Now is the time for everyone, setting aside individualistic thinking, to reflect and awaken. It is a time to put aside personal gain and think first of the nation's peace and prosperity. Without a <36> nation, what peaceful family can there be, and where can an orderly society exist? Scholarship, livelihood, social interaction, production—all these are things that come after the nation exists. You must have already seen it: Belgium, Holland, Poland, France—the state of these defeated nations. The mothers living there cannot hold their sons in their laps morning and evening. The people living there cannot freely eat even two meals a day. Laughter is gone, family harmony is shattered, and the facilities of civilization are destroyed.

We must first protect the country. We must first love the country. To protect one's own family, one must protect the country even more; to love the society to which one belongs, one must love this country all the more.

Now, there are many ways to love the country, but among them, the highest, greatest, and most glorious way is to become a soldier of the nation and offer one's life to His Majesty. Where could there be a task so noble, sacred, and great?

Since the Manchurian Incident, through the China Incident, military fervor has risen among all classes in the Korean Peninsula, and patriotic loyalty is manifested in every event, which is extremely gratifying.

I earnestly hope that this devotion offered to the Sovereign and Nation will burn even brighter, and that you, the mothers and sisters, will provide good guidance so that hundreds of thousands, millions of robust youths wishing to volunteer will emerge in the future. <37>

**Memorial Stele for Yi In-sŏk**
**To Be Erected in His Hometown, Okch'ŏn, North Ch'ungch'ŏng Province**

Superior Private Yi In-sŏk, the first volunteer soldier to tread upon the battlefields of North China with blood-stained military boots, fought desperately with rifle and bayonet on the front lines of national defense, and finally became a cornerstone for the protection of the fatherland, dying gloriously in battle. As a young elite soldier of whom the Peninsula compatriots are proud, this Imperial Army hero's military exploits were not only praised with the Order of the Golden Kite but also represent the highest honor for a warrior born on the Peninsula. The Peninsula compatriots, taking this as a symbol of deep emotion, are boiling with patriotic sincerity. Now, to eternally convey the legacy of Superior Private Yi In-sŏk to future generations, discussions have arisen in his hometown, Okch'ŏn County, North Ch'ungch'ŏng Province, to erect a memorial stele. A preparatory committee has been formed, with Mr. Chŏng Ku-p'yŏng (鄭求平) as Chairman, who, together with County Magistrate Ni(i)oka Shigezō (新岡繁藏), will appeal to the public. Already, voices from behind the lines, praising the loyal valor of hero Yi In-sŏk and urging the promotion of the memorial stele construction, have been heard with enthusiasm, and support has been pledged by numerous volunteers. Accordingly, in Okch'ŏn, the birthplace of Yi In-sŏk, preparations for the erection are proceeding as an honor for the hometown.

**The Nation is Grateful to the Women of the Peninsula**
**By Ōno Teruko (Wife of Political Affairs Superintendent Ōno), Head of the Chōsen Branch, Patriotic Women's Association**

A mother's pride! I believe it lies in giving birth to splendid children and raising those children splendidly to become workers for the nation and society. Among these, having a splendid son who is a bulwark of the nation is, I think, the greatest honor for a mother. Currently, our country, since July of Shōwa 12 (1937), has been engaged in a Holy War to chastise the lawlessness and injustice of the outrageous Chungking pseudo-government and establish eternal peace in the East. During this time, the brilliant military might of the Imperial Nation has already swept over most of the Chinese continent, and the Imperial威 (majesty) is being manifested throughout the world. The people's patriotism is ever-increasing, and for youth, it is a time when blood boils and flesh leaps. Even on the Peninsula, where there was no conscription system yet, the patriotic fervor of the youth boiled over, their Red Sincerity (赤誠) was reciprocated, and finally, the Army Special Volunteer Soldier system was established on the Peninsula. Youths rushed to participate in this Glory, and already, as honorable Imperial soldiers, they are displaying peerless loyalty and courage, achieving <38> brilliant military merits. The entire nation offers them absolute trust, gratitude, and respect, praying for their continued fortune in war. At the same time, we do not forget our deep gratitude and respect for the mothers who bore and raised these volunteer soldiers.

The Patriotic Women's Association (愛國婦人會) is a military support organization centered on the Imperial Household, uniting all Japanese women. This time, the Chōsen Headquarters has decided to present doorplates reading "陸軍特別志願兵名譽之家" (House of Honor of an Army Special Volunteer Soldier) under the Rising Sun flag to your honorable homes, thereby honoring the family's distinction and praying for the long-lasting military fortunes of the volunteer soldiers. Simultaneously, in cooperation with neighboring Patriotic Women's Association members, we will strive to strengthen support for the families of volunteer soldiers left behind. As mothers of volunteer soldiers, I hope you will consider the humble sincerity of the Patriotic Women's Association, ensure that the heroes have no worries about things left behind, enable them to fully exert themselves for the Sovereign and Nation and fulfill their loyalty, and further strengthen the home front. This is my heartfelt prayer.

**On the Occasion of the Erection of the Memorial Stele for Superior Private Yi In-sŏk**

Superior Private Yi In-sŏk participated in the Holy War for the construction of a New East Asia, devoted his loyalty, became a cornerstone thereof, and died gloriously on the battlefields of the continent. Offering his life, he died for the Sovereign and Nation. As a soldier of the Great Japanese Empire, he fulfilled the duty of a subject and the true desire of a man. His heroic spirit, along with his military exploits, has been <39> enshrined at Yasukuni Shrine. His name shines with the sun and moon, and his deeds live eternally with the mountains and rivers.

Superior Private Yi In-sŏk lives eternally. It is truly a fine thing that a memorial stele is to be erected for him in his hometown as a god of Yasukuni. Thus, looking up to this memorial stele as a model, I pray that the spirit of loyalty will be ever more greatly cultivated.

**Military Service Obligation and True Citizens**
**By Ch'oe Rin, President of the Maeil Sinbo**

Respectfully, I congratulate your company on its prosperity.
Note:
"A populace without the obligation of military service is not a true populace." I send this one phrase to the mothers and sisters of the Peninsula to substitute for words of encouragement and gratitude.

**To Mothers, Sisters, Wives**
**By Yi Kwang-su, Former Chairman of the Chōsen Writers' Association**

Mother. Do you have a son? Then send him as a volunteer soldier. Is that son precious? All the more reason to send him as a volunteer soldier. Do you only have one son? Even so, send him as a volunteer soldier. <40>

Sisters. Encourage your older brothers to go as volunteer soldiers.
"Brother. Go be a soldier. I can't go because I'm a girl. Aren't you a manly man (*sanae taejangbu*)? So, go enlist as a soldier. Become a brave soldier, become someone who fights for His Majesty the Emperor. Going to the battlefield, fighting manfully, and dying shouting 'Long live our Emperor!' is a blessing not everyone can have, but even just becoming a soldier and doing one's duty repays the Emperor's grace, doesn't it? Brother, hurry and go be a soldier."
Sisters. Encourage your older brothers like this.

And young wives. Tell your husbands to go be soldiers.
"Why don't you, a robust young man, enlist? Aren't millions of our compatriots shedding their blood on the battlefield for His Majesty right now? With what face can you remain idle? Are you concerned about your parents? If there is no country, where will your parents live? The children? If there is no country, how will the children live? Haven't you seen the peoples without their own country and the peoples defeated in war? Hurry and go off to be a soldier. Though I am a weak woman's body, I alone will attend to your parents and raise the children. If you go to the battlefield and return victorious, that would be even better. If you should die fighting, I will observe mourning rites (*sangbonghasol*) for you to the end with my single body, so please go without worry.
"You feel sorry for me? Nonsense. I too am a wife of Japan. If you were leaving home for some other reason, I would weep with <41> sadness. But if you go as a soldier for His Majesty the Emperor, I will weep with joy and glory. If you were to die of illness, the pain of being widowed in my youth would break my heart. But if you die on the battlefield for His Majesty, I will revere you as a god (*sin*) and bow to you my entire life. Everyone else is going off to be soldiers, everyone is going to the battlefield; if you, with your healthy body, stay at home, how can I live, feeling sorry towards His Majesty the Emperor and ashamed before others? Come now, listen. Don't worry about your parents, don't worry about the children, don't worry about me, just leave decisively. That is filial piety as a son, and the right path as a husband and father. Didn't all our ancestors do so in the old days?"
Young wives. Encourage your husbands like this.

Let me tell you an old story. It happened about a thousand years ago. About 1,200 years ago, I believe.
It was a time when Chōsen was divided into the three kingdoms of Koguryŏ, Paekche, and Silla.
In the kingdom of Silla, there was a young gentleman (*sŏbangnim*) of seventeen named Hwarang Hwang Ch'angnang. At that time, the kingdom of Paekche frequently invaded Silla, and the Silla army was often defeated in battle, losing much territory. In Paekche, there was a famous general named Kyebaek (階伯). He loved only his country and paid no mind to his own body or his home. Therefore, he was a fearsome general. This happened later, when Paekche was about to fall, but Kyebaek, knowing he could not possibly defeat the allied forces of Silla and Tang China, first killed his own wife and children, then went out to the battlefield and fought to the end, fought with all his might, and died. Because such a general existed, his subordinate soldiers also knew only the country, like Kyebaek, and disregarded their own bodies. That was why they defeated Silla whenever they fought.

At this time, the king of Silla was greatly worried and summoned his officials, asking for a clever plan to stop Paekche. Then, one high official reported,
"If there is just one general who does not fear death, Paekche can be stopped."
His reasoning was that if one person goes out unafraid of death, the other soldiers will follow him.
The king and the officials all said,
"Indeed, that is so. Those are wise words," <42>
and agreed.
However, when the king asked,
"Then who will go out and die?"
no one answered or stepped forward.
The king and the officials all lost heart and fell into despair.
At this moment, a certain youth stepped forward, saying,
"I, your subject (*sin*), will go out and die."
Everyone turned to look; it was Hwarang Hwang Ch'angnang, who was still only sixteen or seventeen years old.
The king was greatly pleased. So he gave him soldiers and ordered him to fight the Paekche forces.
Hwang Ch'angnang returned home and bid farewell to his grandfather.
"Oh. Do not let me see you alive before my eyes again. Your father also fought for the country and did not return alive," the grandfather encouraged this young grandson.
Then he bid farewell to his mother. The mother took Hwang Ch'angnang to his father's ancestral shrine. And she offered this prayer (*koch'uk*) before her husband's spirit tablet:
"Your widowed wife reports to my husband's spirit. Your flesh and blood, having been raised, is now going forth to the battlefield on the king's business. It feels as though I have laid down the heavy burden I carried, as though I have fulfilled my duty as a wife. May your spirit, in the unseen world (*myŏngmyŏngjung*), help him fight and die as befits your son."
After offering this prayer, she turned to her son and said,
"You answered well. Now that you are a body offered to the king, leave without a moment's delay."
Next, Hwang Ch'angnang went to the room of his wife, whom he had married not long ago, and took his leave.
"Our fate as husband and wife was not long. Now, due to the king's business, I must leave for good, which is a sad thing. If I go now, I shall not return again. I entrust my elderly grandfather and mother to your care," he said.
Thereupon, the young bride replied,
"For a great man (*taejangbu*) born into the world, what task is there that everyone shouldn't do, to die for the king's business? Though this body is humble, I shall attend to Grandfather and Mother, and also, if the flesh and blood of yours within my womb is, by heaven's fortune, a boy, I shall raise him to follow in your footsteps." <43>

Hwang Ch'angnang spurred his horse and rode out to the battlefield. Having resolved to die, he had nothing to fear. Charge, and charge again! Because Hwang Ch'angnang fought bravely, the Silla soldiers, said to be so weak, all became brave warriors, and in a few days' fighting, they drove back all the Paekche forces that had entered Silla territory.
However, Hwang Ch'angnang had sworn to die. Even after winning the battle, he penetrated deeper into the Paekche camp, beheaded several dozen more Paekche soldiers, and was finally surrounded by Paekche soldiers, captured, and dragged before General Kyebaek.
General Kyebaek saw that Hwang Ch'angnang was still a youth not yet twenty. Amazed at his courage and skill, he said,
"The national destiny of Silla must still be long, for there is a person like you,"
and specially spared his life. He tied the heads of the Paekche soldiers Hwang Ch'angnang had cut off to Hwang Ch'angnang's horse and sent Hwang Ch'angnang back alive. A hero recognized a hero.
Hwang Ch'angnang had no choice but to return home at night, alone on horseback.
The servants, seeing their young master return victorious and alive, were joyful and went to his mother to report,
"The young master has returned."
Thereupon the mother, startled, asked,
"The young master has returned? How did he return?"
"He returned with the heads of Paekche soldiers dangling from his horse," the servants replied.
"My son would not return alive; it must surely be a goblin (*yogoe*). Tell him to go away,"
the mother ordered in great anger.
Hwang Ch'angnang, hearing his mother's words relayed by the servants, bowed his head for a long while, then had them convey his request:
"Mother's command is most proper. I shall go out again to fight and die, but since I have already returned, I wish only to see Mother's face once."
"Tell him that a son who swore to the king he would go out to die, even if he returns victorious, is not my son if he returns alive," <44>
the mother refused to listen.
Hwang Ch'angnang bowed his head once more.
"Then I have an unfinished request; tell them I wish to meet the young mistress (*assi*) briefly."
He sent a servant to relay the message.
However, the reply was this:
"The day the young master left was the young master's memorial day (*jeil*). I have already been wearing mourning clothes (*kŏsang*) since that day. What young master could possibly come again? Tell him I am not a wife who would open the door to such a young master."
Thereupon, Hwang Ch'angnang bowed once towards the palace and his home, then turned his horse again towards the battlefield and galloped away.
Hwang Ch'angnang fought again, killed many Paekche soldiers, and was finally captured and brought before General Kyebaek.
"I pardoned you once and let you live, yet you come again bearing a sword?"
General Kyebaek thus rebuked Hwang Ch'angnang.
"As long as this life exists, I will come bearing a sword even ten times,"
Hwang Ch'angnang replied.
"Finally, do you have any wish? I value your courage and skill; I will grant you one wish, whatever it may be."
General Kyebaek felt it was a pity to kill such a man. His thought was to let Hwang Ch'angnang live if only he wished it.
"My wish is for General Kyebaek's head. Other than that, I have no wish whatsoever,"
Hwang Ch'angnang replied.
Kyebaek, knowing his will could not be bent, personally drew his sword and cut off Hwang Ch'angnang's head. That was the final courtesy towards Hwang Ch'angnang, for he regretted having such a hero killed by the sword of a lesser man.
Kyebaek wrote a letter explaining the circumstances of Hwang Ch'angnang's death, tied it to the saddle of Hwang Ch'angnang's horse, placed Hwang Ch'angnang's head in a box, loaded it onto the horse, and sent it back towards the Silla camp.
The horse galloped through the night and arrived at Hwang Ch'angnang's home. Reaching the front of the house, the horse neighed loudly.
"The young master's horse has returned,"
the servants said, leading the horse inside.
Hwang Ch'angnang's grandfather, mother, and wife rushed out wearing mourning clothes (*sobok*). The grandfather read Kyebaek's letter.
The mother held Hwang Ch'angnang's head in her bosom and cried,
"Oh, my son!" <45>
"Oh, my grandson!"
"Oh, my husband!"
The grandfather and the wife also clasped their hands towards Hwang Ch'angnang's head.
Mothers,
Wives,
Sisters,
This was the way our ancestors lived.
Now we have become the glorious subjects (*sinmin*) who protect the great nation of Japan under the grace of our sacred Emperor. Just as Silla, Paekche, and Koguryŏ became one country in the old days, we Chōsen people have now become one with the homeland (*naichi*) and are exactly the same subjects of the nation of Japan. We have become the legitimate children (*chŏkcha*) of His Majesty the Emperor. We must deeply feel this great grace and repay it.
A mother of Japan must not think of her son as her own. She must know him as one entrusted to her by His Majesty the Emperor. Raising a son and offering him to His Majesty the Emperor is the sacred duty of a mother. By doing so, we repay His Majesty's grace and, at the same time, receive blessings and glory for ourselves and our descendants.
Your older brother belongs to His Majesty the Emperor.
Your husband belongs to His Majesty the Emperor.
Your body belongs to His Majesty the Emperor.
This is the Japanese spirit (*Nihon seishin*).

**To the Women of the Peninsula**
**By Kaita Kaname, Army Infantry Colonel, Instructor at the Chōsen Government-General Army Soldier Volunteer Training Center**

History proves that many of those called great men and outstanding figures since ancient times were born from the great influence of their mothers; there is nothing as great as a mother's influence. Particularly in the East, where morality and culture developed centered around the family system since olden times, <46> a mother's edifying influence (*kunka*) in the home holds such great power as to govern a child's entire life.

How strongly the children of Japan must have been raised as citizens by the Japanese mothers who, while holding their beloved child in their loving embrace, taught them, "When you grow up, become a splendid person and devote your loyalty to His Majesty the Emperor (*Tenshi-sama*)". Kusunoki Masatsura, the Three Human Bullets (*Nikudan San'yūshi*), and the many loyal and brave warriors enshrined as gods protecting the nation (*gokoku no kami*) were all raised under the influence of such mothers.

Just as a mother's love is infinite, a mother's influence is even greater than that. Mothers are the driving force that will bear the future of Japan on their shoulders. When all the women of Japan believe in this power of theirs and undertake the education of the second generation of citizens towards their noble mission, the future of Japan will become ever more promising and gain the weight of bedrock.

Now, the Holy War is already in its fourth year. On the Peninsula, young and old alike, under the self-awareness of being true subjects of the Imperial Nation, are firmly joining hands in *Naissen Ittai* (Japan and Korea as One Body) and marching forward to carry out the Holy War. Particularly, the hot-blooded youth of the Peninsula, whose patriotic passion is irrepressible, responded with the implementation of the volunteer soldier system, and the number of applicants increases dramatically each year. Moreover, the volunteer soldiers who were fortunately selected are diligently devoting themselves to military duties for the honor of Imperial soldiers. Some are engaged in the Holy War, establishing brilliant military achievements, and the situation is such that already two pillars, revered heroic spirits protecting the nation (*gokoku no eirei*), have emerged. As we witness the tear-jerking struggles of these volunteer soldiers, we also consider the great self-awareness and encouragement of the elderly mothers and young wives of the Peninsula hidden behind them, and we hold feelings of gratitude along with even greater expectations for all the women of the Peninsula.

The fact that the mother of the late Superior Private Yi In-sŏk, upon hearing the news of her beloved son's death in battle, showed no signs of distress and was only concerned about the extent of her son's meritorious deeds; the fact that a young wife who sent her husband off as a volunteer soldier bathed in cold water morning and evening to pray for her husband's splendid service (*gohōkō*); furthermore, the fact that a mother in a remote village, disregarding even her own son's death, conveyed his last wishes to a certain volunteer soldier from the same village and pleaded for him to perform service for two men—these indeed show the spirit of awakened Peninsula women, and hearing these stories thickens our expectations for Peninsula women. And we do not doubt that many more second and third such women will appear, along with the honor of the Peninsula.

Women of the Peninsula! Let us wait, as the sole joy given to women, for the day when the beloved children you hold, together with the influence of a good mother, grow up healthily, straight, and righteously, and stand up bravely before the difficult nation, shall we not? <47>

**Honoring Volunteer Soldier Families**
**Presented to 3,000 Households**

Becoming an Army Special Volunteer Soldier has become the object of aspiration for Peninsula youth. When the selection examination period arrives, there are quite a number of youths who submit petitions written in blood to each provincial governor, hoping for acceptance. Families that have produced a trainee (*hunryŏnso saeng*) are envied by the residents of their city, town, or village. This time, the Chōsen Headquarters of the Patriotic Women's Association (愛國婦人會), to signify the honoring of these families of distinction, has decided to present nameplates, 5 *sun* 3 *bu* (approx. 16cm) vertically and 2 *sun* 2 *bu* (approx. 6.7cm) horizontally, inscribed with "陸軍特別志願兵名譽之家" (House of Honor of an Army Special Volunteer Soldier) beneath the Rising Sun flag. Initially, 2,000 were sent out across all of Chōsen on the 1st. For families not yet surveyed, they will be sent as soon as the survey is complete, and it appears the number will surpass 3,000.

**The Gravening Situation and Peninsula Women**
**By Army Major Kaba Isao (蒲勳), Chōsen Army Press Department**

We are already well aware that during the world wars, various countries in Europe and America made special efforts in women's education for the prosecution of the war or the future of the nation. Among them, even in Britain, traditionally considered a conservative country, women became active in various fields of society.

While Japanese women have, since ancient times, left behind many great virtues as homemakers, good wives, and wise mothers, once faced with an emergency situation, it is truly moving that women themselves have advanced onto the streets and into workplaces, engaging in activities in various fields. Particularly, the struggling lives of families of soldiers dispatched to the front—for example, the valiant figures of women who, substituting for husbands or brothers, vigorously engage in agriculture or commerce, or work hard in munitions factories and various other plants—are truly tear-jerking, I think. As they work like this, they not only support the family's livelihood but also lead lives of service, enabling the men sent from their homes to the front to offer their lives joyfully for the nation without worries about those left behind.

Occasionally, at farewell ceremonies for those killed in action, when I see a young wife in mourning clothes standing before her husband's spirit with several small children, I observe the hardship of raising those little ones with only a mother's hand, imagine the various difficulties that lie ahead, and cannot help but pray, "May the help of the gods (*Singami*) be with them."

Furthermore, for general women too, in these times when men's lives have become extremely busy, I think it is safe to say that there are few men who can leisurely enjoy family life with their wives and children. Therefore, the full responsibility for the majority of family life naturally falls upon women, and they must handle not only educational issues but also economic problems and even carry out public <48> duties in place of their husbands.

Amidst this complex and busy life, Japanese women lead lives of service, diligently and silently, without any complaint, fulfilling the responsibility and duty to educate their children as citizens dedicated to loyalty and patriotism (*chūshin hōkoku*). This is the Japan of today's prosperity, the world's number one Japan, which has become the Japanese national character and traditional spirit, and it is a crucial factor. I believe this is a point that the sisters of the Peninsula women must greatly learn from and be greatly roused by.

As you know, that our country is a revered nation unparalleled by any other country in the world is the greatest pride of us subjects of the Imperial Nation, but especially when facing an emergency, the preciousness of our country becomes even more apparent. One feels even more strongly that life is received from the Imperial Nation. However, this fact is not limited only to the occasion of this Incident; examples abound throughout the 2,600-year history of the Imperial Nation.

Sisters of the Peninsula women! I want to ask you to reflect thrice upon whether what you are currently doing, as legitimate children (*sekishi*) of His Majesty the Emperor and as members of the Great Japanese Nation in times of emergency, is truly acceptable as it is.

As subjects (*shinmin*) of the Great Nation of Japan, centered on the Imperial Household, discarding the thought of the nation, striving to offer our lives and names for the Emperor, joining forces, the 90 million compatriots firmly uniting, burning with the Great Conviction to build a new East Asia where East Asians can live happily and obtain better happiness, intending to walk the high and noble path of justice—believing that we will break through this path and secure final light and happiness, are we not continuing our struggle and effort, forgetting the hardships and pains unto death?

Sisters of the Peninsula women! I want to ask you to consider whether your efforts are truly sufficient as citizens in this era of constructing a New East Asia.

Also, as mothers, are you imparting to your children the Japanese spirit (*Nihon seishin*)—to be able to bear the future nation, and as legitimate children of His Majesty the Emperor, as members of the Great Japanese Nation in times of emergency, to splendidly offer their lives for His Majesty the Emperor? Just as there have been proverbs since old times like "Make a beloved child walk the path" and "Hardship makes you," I believe raising children must start from true love (*ai*), with eyes opened by affection (*aijō*). If the mother lacks the sublime and great love (*ai*)—to make her child a mainstay of the future nation and, at the time of death, to die beautifully for His Majesty the Emperor—she cannot raise her child into a splendid youth. Love that yields to the child's whims, swayed by so-called momentary feelings of pity (*airen*) like "it must be painful," "how pitiful," <49> is not a mother's true love. Therefore, just as the proverb says, "A child raised by a grandmother sells for only three pennies," a child given such coddling (*onshōteki*) love and education is useless in any field after growing up. Those who have achieved success in life since olden times, or those enshrined as gods at Yasukuni Shrine who performed great deeds that made even demons weep, were all people possessing the tested Japanese spirit and trained physique from childhood. Scarcely one among them received the coddling education of a gentle mother. Therefore, among the children of rich families or high-status families, there are many who only waste money and lack discipline, thus becoming degenerate. No matter how much wealth and status are left behind, unless the spirit is instilled—that the ultimate strength is death, only death (*shi*)—their value as human beings in society cannot be acknowledged at all. I believe this is where mothers must pay attention.

In the process of disciplining a child, there may be times when one cannot bear the feeling of pity, but the mother herself must not harbor a weak heart and must suppress the coddling love for the child's own good. From such true love of a mother, the child grows naturally well, and the child's natural talents (*tenbun*) are fully displayed. Such great love from a mother surely brings forth filial piety. The way of Great Japan's benevolence and forgiveness (*jinjo no dō*)—"not forgetting parents, not forgetting children, not forgetting the nation, not forgetting God (*Kami*), not forgetting oneself"—becomes clearly established.

In this sense, I believe youth training or military service is most effective in imparting to children, as citizens, the so-called tested spirit (*shiren sareta seishin*) to transcend death and devote themselves to their duties, and in building a trained physique.

As you know, our country's army is an army unparalleled by any country in the world. That is, our country's army is the army of His Majesty the Emperor, directly commanded (*tōsotsu*) by His Majesty the Emperor. Therefore, it is an army that promotes the Imperial威 (majesty) throughout the world and protects the nation; it is an army that expands the Imperial Way (*Kōdō*) throughout the world and displays the National Virtue (*Kokutoku*) throughout the universe. Therefore, the spirit of the army is the mindset that dying is returning alive. That is why, without discrimination, without distinction between civil and military, the entire military and populace as one body (*gunmin ittai*) offer their lives to His Majesty the Emperor—therein lies the value of our Imperial Army (*kōgun*), and also the essence of the Japanese people (*Nihon minzoku*).

Therefore, military service (*heieki*) is the duty and also the right of our citizens. It is as if the citizens, when gathered, become the army, and when dispersed, become the populace. <50>

For this reason, for a Japanese man, serving in the military is not only thought of as the greatest honor for a man, but the entire populace thinks so equally, and one must not forget that they are further citizens.

Now, that the Army Special Volunteer Soldier Ordinance (*Rikugun Tokubetsu Shienhei Rei*) was implemented on the Peninsula last year, and Peninsula compatriots too have gained the path to serve in the military, promoting the Imperial威 (majesty) and protecting the nation, is truly something to be celebrated for the sake of the nation and also for the Peninsula compatriots. Although this system is not the application of a complete Conscription Law (*Heieki Hō*), once one has received the Glory of serving in the military through volunteering, regarding the treatment of their status and service, they are identical and without discrimination to soldiers enlisted through general conscription, thus becoming servants (*gohōkō*) offering their lives just like general officers and soldiers. Also, through one's labor and effort, one can become a non-commissioned officer or even an officer. Therefore, we thought that applicants for volunteer soldiers would come forth in large numbers from various fields, but looking at the results, it seems our expectations were not met.

That is, it is no exaggeration to say that almost no applicants come from middle-class or higher families, or from rich families. It is truly regrettable that these people, despite having demanded the implementation of the volunteer soldier system and the conscription system themselves, remain idle without volunteering their own sons or brothers now that it has been implemented.

Why do they not volunteer their sons? Considering the reason, I wonder if it stems from the old Chōsen way of thinking, namely, valuing literature (*mun*) and despising martial arts (*mu*)? Or is it because soldiers go to war, and thus die in battle, so they don't send them? Or is it due to so-called coddling love? All of these are based on individualism and liberal thought, and their failure to recognize the times is severe; as subjects of the Imperial Nation, it is utterly outrageous (*gongo dōdan*). Unless this way of thinking is swept away even one moment sooner, and the spirit is instilled in children—"Go die an honorable death in battle before His Majesty the Emperor!"—Peninsula people can never become splendid Imperial subjects walking alongside the 70 million homeland compatriots, and furthermore, the Peninsula compatriots will fall even further behind the times.

Are not the people of Great Japan today offering their precious bones and shedding blood, offering their lives to His Majesty the Emperor, to build a new order for the sake of East Asian peace, so that East Asians can receive happiness as splendid East Asians, facing the world? In contrast to this, although the Peninsula compatriots are making efforts behind the lines, they still <51> fall short of the desperate efforts of the homeland compatriots.

You are witnessing firsthand the recent military procurement boom (*gunju keiki*). As it is a favorable boom (*kōkeiki*), you know and feel even more the preciousness of our country.

This, though I hesitate to say it, is nothing other than the Imperial Majesty (*Goryōi*). But what else could it be if not the blessing of our loyal, brave, peerless, successive victories? If one understands this grace and burns with even a little feeling of repaying the kindness (*hōon*), I think middle-class and higher families, especially rich families, should have some understanding of the volunteer soldier system. I hope they will change their thinking at this time.

My intention is to quickly place your sons into the atmosphere of the Japanese spirit's trial (*Nihon seishin shiren no fun'iki*) to make them stand as subjects of the Imperial Nation, and also, I want to make them non-commissioned officers or officers, who are cadres of the Imperial Army—the glory and pride of Japanese men. For this, I think there will be no better opportunity than volunteering as a soldier. Next is youth training (*seinen kunren*). Youth training tempers the youth's body, polishes the spirit, and creates splendid youths capable of playing a true role, possessing the spirit (*kihaku*) to strive unto death for the nation and for the family. This youth training is actively implemented in various countries around the world. In the homeland (*naichi*) too, a youth who finishes youth training and does not serve in the military cannot be recognized as a full-fledged youth.

Though it may be an early example, the primary requirement when choosing a son-in-law has become someone who has served in the military and completed youth training. If you want your son to succeed splendidly no matter what field he enters or what hardships he encounters, and to possess the spirit to strive and fight for the Sovereign and Nation like a Japanese man in times of emergency, rising again even if he falls, having him undergo youth training is the shortcut (*kindō*).

I heard that during the recent volunteer soldier inspection, those who had received youth training were truly splendid and outstanding in their movements and manner of speaking—it was excellent. If you truly want to make your son a genuinely splendid person who does not fall behind others no matter what field you send him into, and if you want him to perform splendid service (*gohōkō*) for the nation, it would be best to enroll him in a youth training center.

The above was specifically mentioned because, during the recent volunteer soldier recruitment inspection, I heard from applicants that opposition to volunteering from mothers was extremely common, and I felt that this should not be the case.

It is not because we lack soldiers that I am urging you. <52>
In the homeland, even after taking the number of conscripts required by the national army, there are still youths remaining. Also, regarding soldiers sent to war, as seen in Chōsen, there are garrisons in the homeland too, and their numbers are greater, not fewer, than before the war. Our country is not one to falter in a war of this scale. Since ancient times, our country's soldiers have been the armed military, and the populace the unarmed military; therefore, their spirit is the common Japanese spirit. That is why, starting with the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars, we have never once been defeated when fighting foreign countries. This current war is just beginning, but even if the world powers were to attack our country, the entire populace burns with the beautiful Japanese spirit of gladly dying for His Majesty the Emperor, like an armed military, so victory lies with us.

To achieve anything, one must not seek comfort or fear death (*shi*). It requires the struggling effort (*funtō doryoku*) of facing death to the end. Without the struggling effort that scorns death, the spirit of the universe might remain hidden in some corner.

The path for Peninsula compatriots to become subjects of the Imperial Nation is simple. It is to offer one's own life (*shinmei*) to His Majesty the Emperor. That is, it lies in the embodiment and practice (*taidoku jissen*) of the Japanese spirit.

If you love your children and yearn for their future light and happiness, please send them to the barracks, the place of trial and practice (*shirenjō oyobi jissenjō*) of the Japanese spirit. This is the true love of a mother and the happiness of the Peninsula compatriots.
This is the spirit of what I am telling you.

**Words Presented to the Mothers and Sisters of Volunteer Soldiers**
**By Chŏng Kyo-wŏn, Director, National Spiritual Mobilization Chōsen League**

Having received life as a man, one must fulfill the duties of a man. Among a man's duties, the greatest, no matter what one says, is likely undertaking the heavy responsibility of national defense as a soldier. However, until now, the youth of the Peninsula were not blessed with the opportunity to fulfill this duty of national defense. The creation of the Special Volunteer Soldier system thus provided the youth of the Peninsula with a path to fulfill their duties as men and bestowed upon them limitless light. However, <53> as this was something unprecedented for Chōsen, there were instances where individuals, despite burning with fervent loyalty and patriotism (*jinchū hōkoku*) in their hearts and wishing to volunteer, were unfortunately prevented by mothers, sisters, or close relatives who did not understand the true meaning of the system. I imagine these mothers and sisters immediately associated the term "soldier" (*pyŏngt'ae*) with death in battle (*chŏnsa*), and the psychology of not wanting to let their beloved children die was at play. But becoming a soldier does not immediately mean dying in battle. If sent to the front, of course, one must have the spirit (*iki*) not to expect to return alive, yet in a human lifetime, who can avoid death? Indeed, death in battle is the purest and highest way to die among human deaths. Even if a volunteer soldier were to die in battle, it is a death after fulfilling the best and highest duty; therefore, it is boundless honor not only for the individual himself but also for the entire family, clan, and village. His meritorious deeds will shine in the annals (*chikuhaku ni kagayaki*) and possess eternal life. It is a matter of our heartfelt admiration that the mothers and sisters of volunteer soldiers since the system's inception have well grasped these principles, fulfilled their devotion as mothers and sisters of soldiers, and contributed to the volunteers generally achieving good results from beginning to end.

**Eulogy for the Late Superior Private Yi In-sŏk**

The heroic death in battle of the late Superior Private Yi was the noblest way to die among modern Chōsen people. Through Mr. Yi's death, the one hundred million compatriots, striving towards the sacred goal of constructing a New East Asia, seem to have renewed their determination to further solidify the unity of *Naissen Ittai* (Japan and Korea as One Body) and devote their full strength to the complete accomplishment of the Holy War's objectives. What a courageous, righteous, and heroic figure Mr. Yi presented, engaging in brilliant activity amidst the enemy's heavy encirclement, even at the moment of being severely wounded by enemy bullets, praying for the fulfillment of the Holy War's objectives, and scattering like a flower on the North China front while shouting "Banzai!" for His Majesty! Your death, reverently, reached the Emperor's ears (*tenchō ni tasshi*), and by His Majesty's consideration (*omeshimeshi*), your spirit (*rei*) is already enshrined as a god of Yasukuni, and the praise and reverence of your homeland are also boundless.
Furthermore, since the present and future youth of the Peninsula will forever look up to you as a model (*kikan*) and cannot cease their eternal admiration, it would not be an exaggeration to say that you, though deceased, have planted eternal, infinite life in the minds and hearts of Peninsula youth. I respectfully pray for your repose. <54>

**Hopes for the Mothers and Sisters of Volunteer Soldiers**
**By Yi Ka-wŏnbo (李家源甫), Head of the Social Education Section, Government-General**

The Army Special Volunteer Soldier system, implemented in the spring the year before last, was deeply impressed upon the popular mind as the most glorious and epoch-making event for our Peninsula. Through this, a new path was opened for the 23 million compatriots of the Peninsula to truly become His Majesty's limbs (*kokō*) and bear the great responsibility of national defense.

Here, we must deeply reflect on how we should respond to thisありがたき (precious) Sacred Will (*seishi*) in the future.

As you know, Japan is currently under a wartime footing (*senji taisei*). Not only the officers and soldiers at the front lines, but also the citizens behind the lines, who should literally be the supporters (*ushirodate*) of these heroes, must cooperate together and advance with deep understanding and resolve towards the objective of the present Holy War; otherwise, the desired goal cannot possibly be achieved. Herein, the significance of the volunteer soldier system based on "Impartial Benevolence" (*isshi dōjin*) increases in importance, and concurrently, a firm mental preparedness is demanded from the families – the mothers and sisters – of these volunteer soldiers. No matter what, women must always possess the resolve (*kakugo*) of being mothers of the Imperial Nation and wives of the Imperial Nation. Especially at a time like today, when the total power of the nation (*kokumin no sōryokusen*) is being called for, it is absolutely impossible for the female mind (*fujin shingake*) to stand outside the sphere of war as a Japanese citizen, nor should such a thing be permitted.

We should once again recall that the cause of Germany's tragic defeat in the previous European Great War lay in the loss of morale (*kiryoku sōshitsu*) among the women who should have protected the home front (*jūgo*). Thus, the position of women is extremely important for their nation, and it is already common knowledge that they have determined the rise and fall of their countries since ancient times.

Viewed from this perspective, giving heartfelt comfort and encouragement to the volunteer soldiers – these loyal and brave Imperial soldiers who have been selected this time to become His Majesty's great support (*ōmi hokotate*) and stand bearing the true national crisis (*kokunan*) – and strongly nurturing them is the honorable <55> duty bestowed upon the women of the Peninsula at present.

Please understand this point thoroughly, foster as much as possible the correct desire of the youths to rise up, and together, with the pride (*kyōji*) of being subjects of the Imperial Nation, strive strongly and brightly, with unwavering effort (*futaiten no doryoku*), for the building of the family, and by extension, for the development of the Imperial Nation. This is my particular and earnest prayer.

**The Mother of a Volunteer Soldier Who Moved Me**
**By Miwa Watarō, Secretary, Chōsen Anti-Communist Association**

It was Shōwa 13 (1938), when Kim Kwang-ryŏn (金光鍊), selected from among numerous applicants as a Chōsen Army Special Volunteer Soldier, left behind his hometown of Kyŏnghŭng in North Hamgyŏng Province, near the border, as a first-term trainee. The season was the height of summer.
At that time, Mr. Kim's mother understood about the volunteer soldier system, but letting Mr. Kim volunteer meant letting her beloved child leave her side, and naturally, worry came first, so she couldn't immediately decide.
However, moved by Kwang-ryŏn's earnest desire, pleading even with tears in his eyes, the mother's heart was finally swayed, and she finally consented.
And at the end of July that year, the Changkufeng Incident (張鼓峯事件) suddenly broke out.
Kyŏnghŭng, close to Changkufeng, became a battle zone. Not only did enemy bullets fly in from three directions, but later, bombers flew over and dropped bombs indiscriminately.
Our front-line troops suppressed the Soviet forces crossing the border line, counter-attacked, and launched an offensive.
However, the further our army advanced, the fiercer the enemy's artillery fire became.
The people living near the border could no longer just silently watch the army's actions. Starting with the self-defense corps (*jieidan*), the elderly and young, the entire village turned out, taking on tasks from carrying bullets and provisions to even the arduous duty of messengers (*denrei*), beginning cooperative work covered in sweat and mud.
However, as the Soviet forces still increased their aircraft and artillery attacks, the settlement <56> was filled everywhere with exploding bombs and shells, presenting a scene unlike anything of this world.
Therefore, an evacuation order was issued by the police for the elderly, women, and children to withdraw to a safe place for the time being.
At that time, Mr. Kim's mother also evacuated immediately with nearby people, wearing only the clothes on her back, into the pine forest on the mountain behind, watching the screams of exploding shells with a pounding heart.
Bombs sending up clouds of sand and dust (砂廛), machine gun bullets from enemy aircraft strafing the ground, the sound of them piercing corrugated iron roofs, light, smoke, dust (■廛)—facing this suffocating scene, what suddenly came to her mind was the situation when her son Kwang-ryŏn would stand on the front line.
Thinking about when Kwang-ryŏn, now a trainee, might have to stand and fight on this terrible front line, she became anxious about the state of the front.
"Ah, it's dangerous to go out now, dangerous—"
Shaking off people trying to stop her, she leaned out from between rocks and gravestones, staring intently (*jītsu*) at the state of the front line across the Tumen River (*Tōmankō*).
The enemy aircraft, wary of friendly ground fire, dropped a rain of bombs indiscriminately, sometimes in formations of twelve or thirteen, sometimes over thirty-five.
The bombs dropped in an attempt to hit the Kyŏnghŭng International Bridge just below her eyes only felled two or three willow trees downstream from the bridge, merely digging large holes in the riverbank in vain.
At that time, the enemy ground forces, emboldened by the air raid, could be seen advancing towards Changkufeng downstream, led by several dozen tanks, with infantry units following.
"Ah, so many enemies have come out, will it be alright?"
As the mother watched anxiously (*haraku shite*), friendly artillery shells flew over her head with a roar (*gūtsu to unari*), two, three shots, raising white smoke (*patsu patsu*), hitting one after another. With twelve or thirteen shots, the enemy tanks were either lying on their sides showing their bellies, or had plunged headfirst into holes, almost all rendered inoperable. Then, our army's infantry, who knows when they got there, rose up (*muku muku*) from the grassy clumps (*kusamura*), jumped onto the tanks, threw hand grenades (*shuryūdan*), or set them on fire with gasoline (*kihatsuyu*).
The burning tanks spewed thick black smoke (*muku muku*) endlessly.
The enemy, whose ground forces were crushed, now mobilized their air force, repeating frantic ground strafing and blind bombing.
Looking at our army's positions, <57>
"What are you doing, annoying pests!"
With that kind of attitude, they calmly dug trenches (*zangō*) or repaired roads, working with discipline exactly as if it were that day's drill (*enshū*), clearly visible as if in one's hand.
Having forgotten her fear, leaning her whole body forward,
"Ah, how splendid they are, I'm impressed—"
At the voice of Mr. Kim's mother, the nearby women who had been holding her back until now, came up one by one, two by two, gathering below the viewpoint before she knew it.
"Look there! The lead plane is smoking too—There! Another one shot down! Well done, well done!"
They raised shouts (*kansei*), even clapped their hands, praising the accuracy of our army's shooting.

And the months and days flowed by.
It was around mid-December of Shōwa 13 (1938), when the winter winds blew bleakly. The day came for Mr. Kim, who had graduated from the training center with excellent results, to formally enlist as an Army Infantryman in the XX Regiment.
That day, Mr. Kim's mother, who was resting with a cold, thought,
"Today is the day Kwang-ryŏn enlists. Once he joins the army, who knows when he might be sent to the front. If I don't see him now, I might never see him again."
Pushing through her illness, she came all the way to Nanam. The station was so crowded with people meeting Governor Kojima (兒島知事) that one could barely move.
Then, the express train from Keijō (Seoul) entered the platform, bathed in the cheers of the welcoming crowd.
And, catching everyone's eye, over forty volunteer soldiers, their sunburnt faces shining, accompanied by their escort officer, alighted from the train.
The mother, her eyes shining, looked at the face of each volunteer soldier, but every one looked like her own son, and yet all looked like Japanese soldiers (*Nihon no heitai-san*), and she couldn't find Mr. Kim's figure.
"Oh dear, what happened to Kwang-ryŏn? Could he alone have gotten sick and been delayed? If so, how pathetic that would be. He, who is usually so energetic, especially today... no, perhaps I overlooked him?"
The mother, half in despair, searched frantically for the figure of her beloved child.
In the midst of this,
"Attention! Number off!"
"One, two, three, four, five, six........."
"All present and accounted for!" <58>
" ——"
When the roll call (*tenko*) finished, the escort officer said,
"We will now take a fifteen-minute break. During this time, those with visitors may meet freely. Assemble here at exactly nine o'clock. Attention! Dismissed!"
And what do you know! One of the volunteer soldiers standing right in front of the mother called out nostalgically,
"Mother—"
Wasn't it him? The mother was startled (*bikkuri shimashita*).
"Oh—Kwang-ryŏn, were you here?—"
She finally managed to say, almost shouting.
His features were sharp and defined (*kukkiri to hikishimari*); how changed and splendid his appearance was compared to the son she knew! That healthy, sunburnt face was largely reflected in his mother's tears.
However, the meeting time was now only fifteen minutes. In the brief encounter (*tsukanoma no ōse*), the mother firmly grasped Kwang-ryŏn's hand and said,
"Kwang-ryŏn, forgive me. Mother didn't recognize you, I was truly worried. How I searched for you. But not recognizing my own son's face..."
As she tried to laugh, the harder she tried, the hotter her eyelids became, and she couldn't stop the tears from overflowing.
"Ah, were you able to eat enough during that time? You weren't sick, were you—? Wasn't the training hard?"
Seeing Kwang-ryŏn's face smiling healthily as he replied, those were questions that didn't need asking.
"But, Mother, during that Changkufeng Incident, I was really worried. Mother couldn't sleep properly at night, thinking what if you went to the front line and something happened—"
"Mother, thank you. But please, don't worry like that anymore. From today, I am a soldier of the Great Japanese Empire. Now that I have properly become His Majesty the Emperor's support (*Mikado no hokotate*), I hope to be sent to the front as soon as possible. And when I stand on the front line, I am prepared to work harder than anyone else. From now on, Mother, you must not have such mistaken worries. Each one of us is prepared to be the first to cast aside our lives and strive for the nation, in order to truly become subjects of the Imperial Nation (*kōkoku shinmin*)."
Kwang-ryŏn said this, his determination showing on his face.
The mother, listening intently (*jitto*) with moist eyes, her voice trembling with suppressed emotion, said,
"Kwang-ryŏn, Mother understands well. I knew it the moment I saw your face just now, but hearing those words clearly, <59> Mother is also happy. Since you were born, Mother held you in her arms, and knew just from your crying or saying 'ah-gah' whether you wanted milk or had a stomach ache. How could I not understand your feelings? Mother understands well. So, you too, from now on, never worry about me, just focus wholeheartedly on your service (*gohōkō*), alright?"
The strength of the true heart of a mother of the militant nation (*gun'koku no haha*), her pure heart loving her child—that directly connects to the heart that loves the country.
Witnessing this beautiful scene of parent-child reunion, the village headman (*menchō-san*) and other volunteers, who had respectfully kept their distance, came forward anew to greet Mr. Kim.
"Ah, Mr. Kim, you've become splendid! From now on, please work hard (*shikkari yatte kudasai*) as an Imperial soldier. Please work for our share too and strive for the nation."
As they encouraged him with these words, Mr. Kim replied,
"Yes, sir! Yes, sir!" (*Hattsu, hattsu*)
With a salute (*kyoshu no rei*).
"Everyone, thank you very much. Kwang-ryŏn must be so happy too."
Saying this, the mother turned to the welcoming party.
"Truthfully, from that Changkufeng Incident until just now, I was worried about my son's safety, and in my heart, I even thought, if possible, I want Kwang-ryŏn back home—regardless of shame or appearances, if only I could take him home from here—. However, seeing Kwang-ryŏn's splendid figure now and hearing his resolve, I clearly understand how mistaken my previous thoughts were, what needless anxiety (*torikoshigurō*) it was. And also, I feel a sense of relief that surprises even myself. No, it's not just relief. My second son, Kil-ryŏn (吉鍊), just graduated from elementary school last year, but when he reaches that age, I am resolved to definitely offer him as the same kind of volunteer soldier to perform service (*gohōkō*). I pledge this anew here before the village headman and all of you."
How encouraged Mr. Kim Kwang-ryŏn must have been by his mother's brave resolve! As he gave a hand salute (*kyoshu no keirei*) towards the assembled people, large tears shone in his eyes.
However, just then,
"Assemble—!"
The order came from the escort officer.
Barely fifteen minutes, seeming like an instant (*isshun*), yet how great was the emotion (*kangeki*) people received along with their tears during that time! <60>
"Well then, everyone, farewell—" (*Dewa minasama gokigenyoku*)
"Mother, I'm going." (*Okāsan, itte mairimasu*)
Called out to, the mother, determined not to cry, tightly suppressed the overflowing tears and watched her beloved child depart.
I happened to witness this scene nearby at this time, and my eyes grew hot. I strongly felt, "Truly, the strength of Japanese soldiers is the strength of the mothers of the militant nation."
And, for Mr. Kim and the forty volunteer soldiers departing, sent off by the strains of "Umi Yukaba" (海行かば - If I Go Away to Sea), I prayed from my heart for their health and long-lasting fortune in war. —The End—

**You Are Truly the Models of Sacrifice, the Models of Service!**
**By Kim Hwal-lan, President, Ewha Womans Professional School**

To All Mothers and Sisters of Volunteer Soldiers,

Regarding love and affection, it is natural for anyone to pray for a separate happiness to visit the path their irreplaceable son or brother takes. However, we must not mistake this love, this affection, for true happiness. Is it not that when the heart forgets to revere something and elevate itself towards it, pride arises in the human child? But if this pride of the heart is allowed to grow rampant like weeds left untended, true happiness cannot possibly grace that individual. Furthermore, can true peace and stability (*ansin ritsumei*) be expected for the birth parents, the siblings sharing the same blood, and by extension, the nation and society composed of such individuals? Thinking this way, I feel an indescribable leaping of the heart, perceiving that you are leading your small, narrow personal world into the large, wide world and personally realizing the true meaning of happiness I mentioned earlier. Becoming a bulwark of the nation (*kokka no kanjō*) is, in any sense, the fulfillment of one's cherished desire (*honkai*). <61> I can well imagine the fulfillment felt by all of you who have offered such children and siblings to the nation. We often speak of sacrifice (*hŭisaeng*) and service (*ponggong*), but you who, despite doubtless enduring various inconveniences, have bravely sent forth your children and siblings as that bulwark, solely wishing for the peace of the nation—you are truly the models of sacrifice, the models of service! I cannot but offer my deep gratitude and respect. Please take great care of yourselves behind the lines, and I pray unceasingly that true, good fortune may attend your children and siblings.

**'Die and Come Back, I'll Tend Your Grave'**
**By Tsuda Setsuko, Women's Division, Green Flag League (緑旗聯盟婦人部)**

What I want to say to the mothers and sisters of those who became volunteer soldiers is "Thank you for sending them out," and "Please wait with peace of mind; the day will surely come when they return as splendid young men and make you happy."
It's hard to understand the real truth of things just from rumors or hearsay in this world. What kind of place is the Volunteer Soldier Training Center? What does it mean to become a volunteer soldier? What is the life of a volunteer soldier like? These things must have been quite difficult for you to understand. Despite that, you who sent your brother or child into that hard-to-understand volunteer soldier life showed courage. Please do not lose that courage from now on.
I heard about the Volunteer Soldier Training Center from both Major Miwa (?) (滿少佐) and Colonel Kaita, and also heard from someone who visited. What I strongly felt was "It's a school." Everyone, the Volunteer Soldier Training Center is a school that teaches the proper life of a Japanese youth! That's what I think. "Therefore, if you can wait with courage just a little longer, these young men will receive splendid education—not just head knowledge, or lip service, or note-taking, or superficial appearances—but serious life guidance, and stand before you again. <62>
The training may be hard at times. Iron too becomes strong by being hammered. Humans too become great by being forged. The life school called the Volunteer Soldier Training Center is a school that builds Japanese men, and also a place that teaches a good, human-like life from morning till night. There will likely be as much difference between those who received this training and those who did not as between hammered iron and unhammered iron. The kind of person absolutely necessary for the Japan of the future is one who holds a firm conviction in the national polity (*kokutai shinnen*) and lives life seriously with all their might.
A young man who wakes up in the morning and tidily makes his bed; a young man who brushes his teeth and washes his hands according to fixed rules; a young man who eats his meals politely, chewing well, and even cleans up his dishes afterwards—such young men being sent out into the Peninsula from now on will surely become the foundation for renewing family life on the Peninsula. Moreover, since an iron-like conviction towards the Imperial Nation is hammered into their hearts, their souls, these are indeed the foremost youths who will shoulder the New Japan.
The volunteer soldiers, after graduating from the training center, will be assigned to various units, and may perhaps be splendidly sent even to the front lines.
"Die splendidly and come back; I will surely tend your grave," Colonel Kaita is said to have encouraged them. They are becoming splendid Imperial soldiers, after all. That's how it should be. But I also believe that upon their auspicious triumphant return (*gaisen*), they will be the front-line heroes of Peninsula life reform.
Mothers, Sisters,
Your brothers and sons have leaped from a life merely as good children and siblings of one family into a great, noble life shouldering all of Japan. Thank you. To that, we offer our heartfelt gratitude. And finally, I say again. Please wait a little longer. There will surely be a day when they stand before you as splendid young men. How much better it is for them to return having acquired a splendid way of life than to attend some useless upper school and return having learned the taste of cafes (*kafee*) and playing with women.
Even if you are lonely, even if you are short-handed, please endure (*sinhau shite*) and wait. I am praying. <63>

**Promotion of National Defense Consciousness and Martial Spirit**
**By Kim Tong-hwan, President of Samch'ŏlli**

Looking through the history of ancient and modern times, it seems to be the law of the world that nations with a strong martial spirit (*sangmu chŏngsin*) invariably prosper, while those leaning towards literary weakness (*munyak*) perish before long. Looking at the recent German-French war that startled everyone's eyes and ears, Germany, which had gritted its teeth (*ch'ŏlch'i pusim*) for 2,000 years, scrimping on food and clothing, exerting all efforts to make shells and receive military drill (*pyŏngsik hullyŏn patki*), is today advancing victoriously (*sŭngsŭng changgu*), having conquered France, isn't it? Conversely, France, intoxicated by its brilliant (*nanmanhan*) culture, wealth, and beauty, passing day by day, has offered its state (*sajik*) at Hitler's military gate (*kunmun*). Its people, becoming almost completely disintegrated refugees (*yurang ŭi min*), followed their government relocating morning and evening—yesterday in Paris, today in Tours (*Chŭru*), tomorrow in Bordeaux (*Porudo*)—weeping from fatigue, despair, and hunger (*kia*). Why are the 40 million French people undergoing such a miserable rout (*p'aeju*)? Paris is said to have fallen merely eight days after the general attack began. It is said there were 500,000 French troops around the perimeter of Paris at that time, so why couldn't they defend the capital and the nation to the last soldier, and why did they throw down their weapons and flee so feebly without any major decisive battle?
Thinking about it, the minds of the French soldiers must have been filled with thoughts of beautiful wives and children, wine (*p'odoju*), prosperous homes, bustling city streets (*siga*), and thus, thoughts of ease and pleasure (*anil kwa hyangnak*). Therefore, giving up their lives at that moment in war for the country meant giving up all these worldly glories (*inse ŭi yŏnghwa*), which they couldn't bear, finding it too regrettable (*akkawŏ*). What was the result? Never mind their own lives, they disgraced their parents, wives, and children, and the nation perished forever, did it not? After losing the nation, where can they go again to find the wealth, beauty, happiness, and glory of France?
I believe there are two sins (*choe*) behind France becoming like this. One is that the nation and society all drifted into individualism and liberalism (*kaeinjuŭi, chayu juŭi*), neglecting national defense consciousness (*kukpang kwannyŏm*) and thus neglecting national training (*kungmin hullyŏn*).
The other reason must be that the mothers, wives, and daughters of France raised <64> their young men to be effete (*munyak*).
The Great War still continues, and we don't know how many more countries will disappear or how many more peoples will perish in the future. However, the conclusion that martial nations will prosper and weak, literary nations will fall (*p'aemang*) will remain unchanged in the outcome.
Mothers and sisters of the Peninsula! Please look at this fact and think deeply. Now, the volunteer soldier system has been implemented in Chōsen, and in just three years, the number of applicants (*chimangja*) has already exceeded 100,000. Now is truly the time when the martial spirit (*sangmu chŏngsin*) is vigorously flourishing (*ulhŭng*). If you have grown sons, please volunteer even one more person, dress them all in military uniforms (*kunbok*), give them rifles (*ch'ong meyŏ*), and stand them on that training ground (*kyoryŏn hanŭn madang*). Now is the time when our country, Japan, is waging a sacred Holy War (*sŏngjŏn*) to establish a new order (*ch'eje*) in the East, so everyone must shoulder the heavy responsibility of national defense. If the military preparedness (*mubi*) of our Empire becomes ever more substantial, this is the time when the targeted new order for all of Asia (*Chŏn Asea*) will be established on this occasion. How can we, the people, who keep the prosperity and happiness of the Empire in mind day and night (*il'ya yŏmdu*), neglect national defense thought (*kukpang sasang*) and the martial spirit at this time?
Let us quickly make soldiers (*pyŏngjŏng*). Let us send our sons out as soldiers, entrust their lives to a high place (*nop'ŭn kot*), and let them be used for the country's well-being. On this occasion, when volunteer applicants have reached 100,000, I earnestly hope even more fervently that the martial spirit will surge (*yongso sŭmch'i*) in the minds of the Peninsula's mothers and sisters.
-The End- <15>
<30-64>

**Summary**

This lengthy article from the July 1940 issue of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine is a compilation piece strongly advocating for Korean participation in the Japanese Army's Special Volunteer Soldier system. Multiple authors, including high-ranking Japanese military officers, prominent Korean intellectuals/collaborators (Yun Ch'i-ho, Yi Kwang-su, Ch'oe Rin, Kim Hwal-lan), and association leaders, praise the system, celebrate the alleged surpassing of 100,000 applicants, and exhort Koreans, particularly women (mothers, sisters, wives), to encourage their male relatives to volunteer. Service is framed as the highest honor and duty for Imperial subjects, essential for repaying Imperial grace, achieving true assimilation (*Naissen Ittai*), contributing to the "Holy War" for a "New East Asia," and ensuring national survival, contrasting Japan's martial spirit with the perceived weakness and subsequent defeat of European nations like France. Stories like that of the "first volunteer martyr" Yi In-sŏk and anecdotes about patriotic mothers are used extensively as propaganda tools.

From a historical perspective, this article is highly significant. It starkly reveals the intensified efforts towards assimilation and militarization in colonial Korea during the wartime period, explicitly linking military service to becoming "true" Imperial subjects and achieving *Naissen Ittai*. The contributions from major Korean figures like Yi Kwang-su and Yun Ch'i-ho demonstrate the co-option of segments of the Korean elite into the Japanese propaganda apparatus. Furthermore, the heavy focus on women highlights the gendered nature of colonial mobilization strategies, appealing to maternal sacrifice and wifely duty to bolster military recruitment and reinforce the ideology of the "militant nation" (*gunkoku*) on the home front. The blend of Japanese and Korean texts, along with the specific arguments and historical/mythological references employed (like the Hwarang story), provides rich material for analyzing colonial ideology, propaganda techniques, and the complex responses within Korean society under Japanese rule.

君國多事의 秋에 志願兵
國家隆興의 母胎는 婦人의 力에 在
朝鮮軍司令部報道部長, 陸軍少將 倉茂周藏
輓近 帝國의 國運의 진전은 駸駸乎 끝이지 않어서 皇道의 선포는 全東亞에 넓으러하며 時局이 중대하고 經綸이 용이하지 않은 것이 진실로 前古未曾有의 機運에＜31＞際會하고 있는 것이 올시다. 이때에 있어 지난번에 陸軍特別志願兵制度가 실시되어 半島同胞에 國防의 重責을 分荷함에 至한 것은 國家國防의 見地에서 또한 內鮮一體의 정신으로부터 진실로 의의 깊은 일이라 아니할 수 없습니다.
원래 我半島동포로 하여금 진실로 皇國臣民된 本質에 徹底케하며 內鮮一體가 되어 다함께 東西의 新事態에 대처하는 光榮을 得하게 하려는 聖慮에 기한 것으로 半島始政來 30년 啓培涵養하여온 2천3백만 동포의 皇國臣民된 自覺과 熱烈한 애국의 至誠이 끝끝내 天에 通한 賜物이며 半島蒼生에 垂하여 주신 皇澤이 더욱더욱 윤택하여 이 深遠한 聖恩의 萬分之一에 奉答할 바일 것은 또한 我等 반도동포에 課된 중대한 책무가 되지 않으면 안됩니다.
도라보건대 지원병제도 창립이래 職員生徒一同 서로 切磋琢磨 잘 陛下의 大御心을 體하여 미래 빛나는 업적을 싸어 이미 3년의 세월을 閱한바 이 사이에 勇躍 第一線에  출동하여 善戰奮鬪 끝끝내 명예의 戰死를 遂하며 혹은 傷하며 혹은 臥病하여써 興亞의 대업에 捧한 훈공은 길이 靑史를 飾하며 내선일체의 빛나는 결실로써 만대에 燦爛한 것이있습니다. 그중에도 李仁錫, 李亨洙, 兩上等兵의 鬼神도 곡할 奮戰과 興亞의 柱礎로써＜32＞ 빛나는 戰死를 일운 훈공은 我國朝野를 擧하여 絶讚感激을 이르켜, 그 중에도 반도청년의 감격은 津津浦浦에 순국충성의 외침이 되어 진실로 皇國臣民 되려하여 지원병을 지원하는자, 날마다 熾熱을 가하여 팽배히 궐기하여 애국의 至誠은 지난번 행하여진 지원병 모집 인원의 비약적 격증의 수에 있어서도 명료한 바이외다.
이것이 물론 시종일관 잘 이 指導의 중책에 있는 당국자의 열의에 의한 바이지만 또한 진실한 황국신민으로서 現下 聖戰의 한가운데서 감연히 이러서준 반도동포의 자각과 그리고 그 불타는 듯한 赤誠에 不外합니다. 더구나 이等 우수한 청년을 陶治薰育하여낸 반도부인의 위대한 힘이 所賜라고 깊이 信하는 바이외다.
古今의 역사를 바라볼 것 없이 國家興隆의 母胎는 반듯이 그 나라의 婦人의 힘이 根基를 이루고 있음에 想到할 때에 婦人의 큰 자각과 활동은 유독 皇軍將士를 鼓舞하여 승리의 因을 배양할 뿐더러 我皇國의 婦人으로서 示한 아름다운 애국의 情操는 즉시 그 子弟의 두뇌에 滲入하여 황국신민된 의식을 굳게 배양하는 결과가 되는 것이외다.
우리제국에는 內로 鐵과 같은 擧國一致의 결속이 있고 軍國의 母의 名에 상응하는 銃后婦人의 확고한 자각과＜33＞ 健氣있는 활동이 있어 이 어머니에 의하여 薰育되는 믿음직한 제2의 황국신민이 있음으로써 국민이 모다 일가족인 듯이 和樂精勵 百勝戰되지 않는 것이 없고, 國運이 隆隆하여 무궁함을 깊이 이해하여서 시국이 더욱 중대하여 지원병제도를 확충 강화되려는 이때에 半島婦人이 光輝있는, 높은 모태로써 위대한 역할을 다하여써 內鮮渾然一體의 美果를 거두기에 진력하기를 빌어마지않는 바이외다.

戰場과 兵營에 功績甚大
第20師團司令部報道部長 陸軍少將 田上八郞
特別志願兵 최초의 희생자로서 大陸戰線에 호국의 꽃으로 흐터진 李仁錫군의 戰死의 報가 전하여 젓슬 때에 밭일에서 도라온 老父가 몬저
「아들은 일본의 군인다운 최후이었습니까」
라고 물었고, 훌융한 戰死의 모양임을 듣고, 미소하면서
「아들은 훌융하게 도움이 되어주었음니까」＜34＞라고 하였다고 함니다. 거기 모와잇든 사람들은 이 말을 듣고 울었다고 함니다. 여러분을 모다 이 李仁錫군의 老父와 같은 생각으로 있는 줄로 믿슴니다.
滿洲事變이래 반도동포가 보인 銃後의 赤誠은 비상한 것이었음니다. 특히 支那事變 발발이래의 그것은 절대한 것이었음니다. 그 국가적 열정의 가운데로 半島를 대표하여 나타난 지원병 諸君의 진실함에는 戰場에, 병영에 빛나는 성과를 나타내고 있음니다.
당신들의 이해있는 가정으로부터 나는 당신의 아들, 당신의 동생은 조국에의 진실한 봉사를 계속하고 있음니다.
帝國 남자로 生하여 총을 메고 粉骨碎身의 봉사를 함은 이러틋 남자의 本懷와 감격이 없는 것이외다. 당신들의 가정으로 그의 대표자를 내고 있음니다. 지원병 자신의 국가적 정신, 헌신적 노력도 그러치만, 지원병의 그러한 기분을 양성하고 지원병으로 하여곰 勇躍 임무에 나아가게 하는 당신들의 이해와 후원은 沒할수 없는 意義, 위대한 힘이라고 생각함니다. 가정은 한아의 협동체임니다. 당신의 대표자를 좀더 굿세게 좀더 아름답게 좀더 깨긋하게 지원하여 달나고 청하는 바이올시다. 나는 특별지원병의 年年 증가하야가는 모양, 훌융한 제국군인으로서 성장하여가는 모양을＜35＞ 바라보면서 감격과 감사의 念을 금할 수 없슴니다.
일본은 지금 興亞의 대사업을 이르키고 있음니다. 새로운 亞細亞를 나코 있음니다. 동양평화를 기조로 하는 세계의 복지를 生出하려고 하는 것이외다. 우리들은 한사람 남김없이 그 책임의 분담자이올시다. 우리들은 충성으로써 나아가지 안으면 안될 것으로 서로 親愛協力하여 단결을 굿게 하지 안으면 안될 것이며 忍苦鍛鍊하여 皇道宣揚에 노력하지 안으면 안된다고 생각함니다.

數十萬, 數百萬에 達하도록
朝鮮志願兵後援會長 尹致昊
朝鮮의 여러 母姊님에게 이 國家多事한 때에 간절히 한가지 말슴을 하고저 하는 것은 여러분은 소중한 자식과 옵바를 병사로 내어보내주섯스니 진실로 감사함니다. 지원병제도가 실시된지 겨우 3년만에 금년드러서 벌서 그 지원자수가 全朝鮮에 10만명을 돌파할 지경이라하니 이러틋 기쁜 일이 어디 있음니까.
이것이 모다 조선의 어머니요, 조선의 누이로 태어나신 당신들이 평소에 자녀를 잘 敎養하였을분더러, 최근에 이르러는 더욱이나 세상 시국이 엇더케 도라가는 것을 깊이 깨닷고 나라를 사랑하는 높은 마음이 움지기는데서 나온 뜻인줄 아옵니다.
지금은 개인주의적 생각에서 너나할 것 없이 모다 반성하고 각성할 때임니다. 모다 개인의 이익을 뒤로 미루고, 국가의 안녕과 번영을 몬저 생각할 때임니다. 국가가＜36＞ 없이 무슨 평화한 가정이 있으며, 어듸에 질서있는 사회가 있겠음니까. 학문도, 생활도, 사교도, 생산도 모도다 국가가 있은 뒤에의 일임니다. 여러분은 이미 보섯슬 것임니다. 白耳義, 和蘭, 波蘭, 佛蘭西 이 모든 나라의 戰敗國의 모양을. 거기에 사는 어머니는 제 아들을 아츰저녁으로 슬하에 안어보지 못함니다. 기기에 사는 백성들은 하로 두끼의 밥도 마음대로 잘 먹지 못함니다. 우슴은 거두어지고 가정의 團欒은 바서지고, 문명의 시설도 破毁되어 있음니다.
우리는 나라부터 직혀야 함니다. 나라부터 사랑해야 함니다. 자기의 가정을 직히려니까 더욱 나라를 직혀야하고, 자기가 속한 이 사회를 사랑하려니까, 더구나 이 나라를 사랑하여야 함니다.
그런데 나라를 사랑하는 길이 여러 길이 있겠지만 그중에도 웃듬이요, 제일 크고 빗나는 길이 나라의 병정이 되어서 폐하께 목숨을 드리는 일이 그것이외다. 이렇게 놉고 거룩하고 큰 일이 어디 있겠음니까.
이제 滿洲事變이래 支那事變을 거처서 조선반도에는 상하층에 모다 軍事熱이 높아지고, 애국의 충성이 사사건건에 나타나고 있는 것은 심히 기뿐 일이외다.
아모조록 君國에 바치는 이 정성이 더욱 끌어서 이 앞으로 지원병을 희망하는 건실한 청년이 여러 십만, 여러 백만이 나게 하도록 여러 母姊님께서 잘 지도하여 주시기를 간절히 바라는 바이올시다.＜37＞

李仁錫의 表忠碑
鄕里 忠北 沃川에 建立
北支의 戰場을 피묻은 군화로 유린, 국방제일선에서 총검을 잡고 死鬪奮ˆ°해서 드디여 호국의 柱石이 되여 산화한 최초의 지원병 李仁錫 上等兵은 반도동포가 자랑하는 젊은 精銳로서 이 황군용사의 武勳은 金鵄勳章으로 찬탄을 받을뿐 아니라, 반도가 낳은 무인 최고의 명예를 반도동포는 感奮의 지표로 하여 애국지성에 끓고 있는데, 이제  李仁錫 上等兵의 遺烈을 영구히 후세에 전하기 위해서 鄕里 忠北 沃川郡에서는 表忠碑 건립의 의논이 일어나서 期成會를 결성하고 鄭求平씨가 會長이 되어 新岡繁藏郡守와 함께 江湖에 호소하게 되였다. 이미 李仁錫용사의 충렬을 讚賀하여 表忠碑 건설 촉진의 열렬한 銃後의 소리가 있어 다수 有志의 원조의 신청이 있었고, 따라서 李仁錫 출생의 땅 沃川에서는 향토의 명예로서 건립준비를 진행시키고 있다.

半島婦人에 國民은 感謝
愛國婦人會朝鮮本部長  大野テル子(大野政務總監夫人)
어머니로써의 자랑! 그것은 훌융한 자식을 낳고, 그 자식을 훌융하게 키워 국가사회 때문에 일꾼이 되게하는데 있다고 생각함니다. 그중에도 국가의 干城인 훌융한 자식을 가지는 일은 어머니로서의 최대의 명예라고 생각함니다. 지금 우리나라는 昭和12년 7월 이래, 暴戾重慶僞政府의 不法不義를 膺懲하고 東洋永遠의 평화를 확립하고저 聖戰을 하고있습니다. 이 사이에 皇國의 빗나는 武威는 이미 支那大陸의 대부분을 風靡하고 皇威宇內에 顯揚하고 있는 바, 국민의 애국심은 작고 향상하여 청년은 피끓고 肉이 뛰는 시절이올시다. 아직 병역제도가 없엇든 반도에서도 청년의 애국열은 끌어서 赤誠은 갑는 바 되어 끗끗내 반도에 陸軍特別志願兵制度가 設하였습니다. 청년은 너나없이 이 光榮에 달려 叅加해서 이미 명예스러운 제국군인으로서 忠勇無雙 赫赫한＜38＞ 武勳을 세우고 있습니다. 전국민은 絶大한 신뢰를 가지고 감사와 존경을 드리어 그 武運長久를 빌고있슴과 동시에 지원병을 나고 키어자래워낸 어머니에 대하여도 다함께 심심한 감사와 尊敬과를 잊지 않고 있습니다.
愛國婦人會는 皇室을 중심으로, 전 일본부인의 결속에 의한 軍事援護團體인바 이번에 조선본부에서는 명예있는 여러분의 집에「陸軍特別志願兵名譽之家」라는 門標를 증정하여 그 집의 명예를 표창하여 지원병의 武運長久를 기원함과 동시에 隣保愛國婦人會員 협력하여 志願兵留守家庭의 援護강화에 힘쓰기로 하였습니다. 지원병의 어머니된 이로서는 愛國婦人會의 微衷을 생각하여 주서서 용사들로 하여곰 이 우에 더 後顧의 憂가 업게 君國 때문에 충분히 활약하여 충성을 다할 수 있도록 일층 銃后의 가정을 굿세게 하기를 中心으로 빌어마지안는 바입니다.

李仁錫上等兵의 表忠碑 建立에 際하여
李仁錫上等兵은 新東亞건설의 聖戰에 참가하여 충성을 다하여 이의 柱礎가 되어 대륙의 戰場에 산화하였습니다. 身命을 바처 君國 때문에 殉하였습니다. 大日本帝國의 군인으로서 臣民의 본분을 다하여 장부의 本懷를 다하였습니다. 그의 영령은 무훈과 함께 靖國神社에＜39＞ 奉祀되었습니다. 그 일흠은 日月과 함께 빗나고, 그 공은 山河와 함께 영구히 살어있을 것이외다.
李仁錫上等兵은 영구히 살고있는 것이외다. 靖國의 神으로서 李仁錫上等兵의 향리에 그 表忠碑를 건립하기로 되었다니 진실로 좋은 일이외다. 그리하여 이 표충비를 귀감으로 仰하여, 더욱더욱 忠義의 念을 함양하기를 빌어 마지 안습니다.

兵役義務와 眞正한 國民
每日新聞社長  崔麟
謹而 貴社의 隆昌을 祝함니다.

「兵役義務가 업는 국민은 진정한 국민이 아니다」라고 이 한마디를 半島의 여러 母姊에게 보내드리어 격려와 감사의 뜻을 代하옵니다.

母, 妹, 妻에게
前朝鮮文人協會長  李光洙
어머니. 아들이 있습니까. 그러면 志願兵으로 보내시오. 그 아들이 소중하십니까. 그러길래 더구나 지원병으로 보내시오. 외아들 밖에 없습니까. 그러터라도 지원병으로 보내시오.＜40＞
누이들. 올아비들이 지원병으로 가도록 권하시오.
「오빠. 병정가세요. 나는 *집애니까 못 가지오. 오빠는 사내 대장부가 아니야요.  그러니까 병정 들어가셔요. 용감한 군인이 되셔서 천황폐하를 위하여서, 싸홀 사람이 되셔요. 전장에 나가서 사내답개 싸오다가 「우리 임금 만세」를 부르고 죽는 것은 저마다 못가질 복이지오 마는 병정만 되어서 저 할 직분만 다하여도 나랏님 은혜를 갚는 것이 아니야요. 오빠 어서 병정가셔요」
누이들. 이렇게 오빠들을 권하시오.
또 젊으신 안해들. 남편 더러 병정 가라고 하세요.
「웨 건장한 젊은 양반이 병정을 안 들어가시오. 지금 여러 백만 동포가 전장에서 나랏님을 위해서 피들을 흘리지 아니해요? 그런데 당신님은 무슨 면목으로 가만히 게시오? 죄송하진들 아니하며 부끄럽진들 아니해요? 부모님 걱정을 하세요? 나라이 없으면 부모님은 어디 사셔요? 자식들이오? 나라이 없으면 자식들은 어떻개 살아요? 지 나라 없는 백성들과 전쟁해서 진 백성들을 보지 못하셔요? 어서 병정으로 나가셔요. 연약한 여자의 몸이지마는 내 혼자서 부모님 봉양하고 자식들 길우오리다. 당신님이 만일 전장에 나가셨다가 승전하고 돌아오시면 더욱 좋고요. 만일 싸호시다가 돌아가신다 하면 내 한몸으로 끝까지 상봉하솔을 할테니 어서 염려말고 병정으로 가셔요.
「내가 불상하다고요. 천만에. 나도 일본의 안해입니다. 당신님이 다른 일로 집을 떠나신다면 나는 슬퍼서＜41＞ 울어요. 그러나 천황님을 위하여서 병정으로 가신다면 나는 기쁨과 영광으로 울겠습니다. 당신이 병으로 돌아가신다면 나는 청춘에 과부된 것이 가슴이 터지도록 아프겠습니다. 그러나 당신이 나랏님을 위하여서 전장에서 돌아가신다면 나는 당신님을 신으로 뫼시고 일생 절하겠어요. 남들은 다 병정으로 가시는데, 다 전장에 나가시는대 당신은 멀정한 몸으로 집에 게신다면 천황님께 황송하고, 남이 부끄러워서 어떻게 삷니까. 자, 여보세요. 부모님 걱정도 아이들 걱정도 내 걱정도 마시고 뚝 떠나셔요. 그것이 자식으로는 효도요, 남편으로도 아버지로도 옳으신 길입니다. 옛날 우리 조상님네는 다 그러시지 아니 하였습니까.」
젊으신 안해들. 이렇개 남편을 권하시요.
내 옛날 이야기 하나를 하오릿가. 한 천여년전 일이야요. 1천2백년쯤 전이겠습니다.
조선이 고구려와, 백제와 신라 세 나라로 갈려 있을 적 일입니다.
신랏나라에 황창랑이라는 열일곱살 된 서방님이 있었지오. 그 때에 백젯나라가 자조 신라를 침노하여서 번번히 신랏군사가 싸움에 져서 땅을 많이 빼앗겼어요. 백제에는 계백(階伯)이라는 유명한 장수가 있었습니다. 그는 나라만 사랑하고 제 몸과 제 집을 몰랐습니다. 그럼으로 무서운 장수였습니다. 이것은 그 후 백제가 망할 땟 일이지마는 계백은 신라와 당나라 연합군을 도저히 이기지 못할 줄을 알고 먼저 제 처자를 다 죽이고 전장에 나가서 끝까지 싸와서, 힘껏 싸와서 죽은 사람입니다. 이러한 장수가 있으니까 그 부하 군사들도 계백과 같이 나라만 알고 제 몸을 몰랐습니다. 그러니까 싸우는 대로 신라를 이긴 것이었습니다.
이 때에 실랏 임금님은 크게 걱정하셔서 제신을 부르시와 백제 막을 묘책을 물으셨는데, 그때에 한 대신이 아뢰기를,
「죽기를 무서워하지 아니하는 장수 한 사람만 있으면 백제를 막을 수 있소」
하였습니다.
한 사람이 죽기를 무서워 아니하고 나가면 다른 군사들도 그를  따른다는 것입니다.
임금님이나 신하들이나 다,
「참 그렇다, 옳은 말이다」＜42＞
하고 찬성하였습니다.
그러나,
「그러면 누가 나가 죽을꼬?」
하고 임금님이 물으시는 말에는 아모도 대답하고 나서는 이가 없었습니다.
임금님이나 신하들이나 다 그만 긔운이 줄고 낙망이 되고 말았습니다.
이 때에 어떤 소년 하나가
「신이 나가 죽겠소」
하고 나섰습니다. 다들 돌아보니 그는 아직 얼닐곱살밖에 아니 된 화랑(花郞) 황창랑(黃倡郞)이었습니다.
임금님은 대단히 기뻐하셨습니다. 그래서 군사를 주셔서 백제진과 싸호라 하셨습니다.
황창랑은 집에 들어서  그 조부께 하직하였습니다.
「오. 살아서 내 눈 앞에 보이지 말렸다. 네 아비도 나라를 위하야 싸와서 살아 돌아오지 아니하였나리라.」하고 조부는 이 어린 손자를 격려하였습니다.
그러고 어머니께 하직하였습니다. 어머니는 황창랑을 다리고 그 남편의 사당으로 갔습니다. 그러고 이렇게 남편의 신주 앞에 고축하였습니다.
「미망인은 지아비님 영전에 아뢰이나이다. 당신님의 혈육은 길러 이제 임금님의 일로 전장에 나아가게 되었사오니 이 몸이 졌던 무거운 짐을 벗어 놓은 듯, 안해의 도리를 다한 듯 하니이다. 당신님 명명중에 도으시와 당신님 아드님다웁게 싸와 죽게 하옵소서.」
이렇게 고축하고는 아들을 향하여서,
「잘도 대답하였어라, 이제 임금님께 바치온 몸이니 시각 지체말고 나가라」
하였습니다.
다음에 황창랑은 혼인한 지 얼마 아니된 안해방에 이르러 작별하였습니다.
「우리 부부 인연이 길지 못하여 이제 임금의 일로 아조 떠나게 되니 슬픈 일이라. 내 이제 가면 다시 돌아오지 아니하리니 늙으신 조부님과 어머님을 부탁하노라」하였습니다.
그런즉 그 새아씨는,
「대장부 세상에 나서 임금님 일로 죽는 일이 어찌 저마다 할 일이오리까. 이 몸이 비록 미거하오나 조부님, 어머님 봉양하옵고 또 복중에 든 당신님 혈육이 천행으로 남자되거든 당신님 뒤를 있도록 양육하오리이다」＜43＞ 하였습니다.
황창랑은 말을 채쳐 전장에 나갔습니다. 죽기를 작정하였으니 무서울 것이 없었습니다. 돌격, 또 돌격, 황창랑이 용감하게 싸우는 바람에 그렇게 약하다고 하던 신랏 군사들이 다 용사가 되어서 며칠 싸움에 신랏지경에 들어온 백젯군사를 다 쳐 물렸습니다.
그러나 죽기를 맹세한 황창랑이라, 승전을 하고 나서도 더욱 깊이 백제 진중으로 들어가 다시 백제 군사 수십명을 목을 버히고 마츰내 백제 군사에게 포위되어서 잡혀 계백장군 앞에 끌려 갔습니다.
계백장군이 보니 황창랑은 아직 이십전 소년이라, 그 용긔와 재주에 놀래여서,
「신라의 국운이 아직도 길리로다, 너 같은 사람이 있음이어」
하고 특별히 살려서, 황창랑이가 버힌 백젯군사의 머리들을 황창랑의 말께 달아, 황창랑을 살려서 돌려 보내었습니다. 용사가 용사를 알아본 것입니다.
황창랑은 할일없이 필마단긔로 밤중에 집으로 돌아 왔습니다.
하인들은, 서방님이 승전하고 살아서 돌아온 것을 보고 기뻐서, 그 어머니께로 가서,
「서방님이 돌아 오셨소」
하고 아뢰었습니다.
그런즉 어머니가 깜짝 놀라며,
「서방님이 돌아오시다니. 어떻게 돌아왔단 말이냐」하였습니다.
「백젯군사의 머리를 주룽 말께 달고 돌아오셨소」하고 하인들이 대답하였습니다.
「내 아들은 살아서 돌아올리 없으니 필시 요괴라, 물러가라 하여라」
하고 어머니는 대노하였습니다.
황창랑은 하인들이 전하는 어머니의 말슴을 듣고 한참이나 고개를 숙였다가,
「어머님 처분 지당하시니, 또 싸와 죽으러 나갈 것이오나 이왕 돌아온 길이니 한번 어머님 자안이나 뵈옵고저 하나이다」
하고 아뢰게 하였습니다.
「임금님께 죽으러 나간다 맹세 여쭙고 비록 승전하였다 하더라도, 살아서 돌아오는 자식은 내 자식이 아니라고 일러라」＜44＞
하여서 어머니는 듣지 아니하였습니다.
황창랑은 또 한번 고개를 숙였습니다.
「그러면 미진한 부탁 있으니 아씨나 잠깐 만나자 하여라」
하야 하인을 보내어 통하였습니다.
그러나 그 회보는 이러하였습니다.
「서방님 떠나신 날이 서방님 제일이라 그날부터 이미 거상을 입었으니, 어떤 서방님이 다시 오시랴. 그러한 서방님께 문열어들일 안해 아니이다 하여라」
이에 황창랑은 대궐과 집을 향하여서 한번 절하고 다시 전장을 향하여서 말을 달렸습니다.
황창랑 다시 싸와서 백제군을 많이 묻지르고, 마침내 잡혀서 계백장군 앞에 끌려 갔습니다.
「한번 용서하여서 살려 주었거든 또 칼을 들고 왔는가?」
계백장군은 이렇게 황창랑을 보고 호령하였습니다.
「이 목숨이 있는 동안 열번이라도 칼을 들고 오겠노라」
황창랑은 이렇게 대답하였습니다.
「마즈막으로 무슨 소원이 없는가. 내 네 용긔와 재조를 아껴 한번 네 소원을, 무엇이라도 들어주리라」
계백장군은 이러한 인물을 죽이기가 아까웠습니다. 황창랑이 원하기만 하면 살려주자는 생각이었습니다.
「계백장군의 목이 소원이오, 그 밖에는 아모 소원도 없노라」
황창랑은 이렇게 대답하였습니다.
계백은 그 뜻을 굽히지 못할 줄을 알고 손소 칼을 들어서 황창랑의 목을 버혔습니다. 그것이 황창랑에게 대한 최후의 우대였으니, 낮은 사람의 칼에 이러한 용사를 죽게하기를 아낀 것이었습니다.
계백은 황창랑이 죽은 연유를 적은 편지 한 장을 써서 황창랑의 말 안장에 달고 또 황창랑의 머리를 함에 넣어 말께 실어서 신랏진중으로 놓아 보내었습니다.
말은 밤도와 달려서 황창랑의 집으로 왔습니다. 집 앞에 와서 말이 크게 소리를 질렀습니다.
「서방님의 말이 돌아 왔소」
하고 하인들은 그 말을 안으로 끌어 들였습니다.
황창랑의 조부와 어머니와 안해가 소복을 입고 뛰어 나왔습니다. 조부가 계백의 편지를 읽었습니다.
어머니는 황창랑의 머리를 품에 품고,
「오 내 아들이여」＜45＞
하였습니다.
「오, 내 손자여」
「오, 내 지아비님이여」
하고 조부도 안해도 황창랑의 머리를 향하여서 합장하였습니다.
어머니들이어,
안해들이어,
누이들이어,
이것이 우리 조상님네들이 살아가던 법이었습니다.
이제 우리는 거룩하신 임금님의 은혜 속에서 크나큰 일본나라를 지키는 영광스러운 신민이 되었습니다. 옛날에 신라와 백제와 고구려가 한나라가 된 것같이 우리 조선사람도 인제는 내지와 하나가 되어서 꼭 같은 일본나라의 신민이 되었습니다. 천황페하의 적자가 되었습니다. 우리는 이 크신 은혜를 깊이 느껴서 보답하지 아니하면 아니됩니다.
일본의 어머니는 아들을 제 것으로 생각하여서는 아니됩니다. 그것은 임금님께서 맡기심 받은 것으로 알아야 합니다. 아드님을 길러서 임금님께 바치는 것이 어머니의 거륵한 직분입니다. 이러하므로 우리는 임금님의 은혜를 보답하는 동시에 우리와 우리 자손의 복과 영광을 받게 되는 것입니다.
당신의 오빠는 임금님의 것입니다.
당신의 남편은 임금님의 것입니다.
당신의 몸은 임금님의 것입니다.
이것이 일본정신입니다.

半島の女性へ贈ろ
朝鮮總督府陸軍兵志願者訓練所敎授, 陸軍步兵大佐 海田 要

昔から偉人傑士と言はれる人の多くがその母の偉大なる感化より生れ出て居ることは歷史の證明するところでありまして、母の感化程偉大なものはないのであります。殊に東洋では昔から家族制度を中心として道德も文化も發達した關係上＜46＞家庭に於ける母の薰化は子供の一生を支配する程の大きな力を持つてゐるのであります。
日本の母親がその慈愛の懷に我兒を抱きつゝ「大きくなつたら立派な人になつて天子樣に忠義を盡すのですよ」と言ひきかせたことが、日本の子供達をどんなに強い國民として育て上げたことでせぅか。かの楠木正行も肉彈三勇士も、そして護國の神として祀られた多くの忠勇の士もすべて斯ぅした母の感化のもとに育てられたのであります。
母の愛が無限であるが如くに、母の感化はそれにも增して偉大であります。母こそ將來の日本を昔負ふ原動力であります。日本の全女性がこの自己の力を信んじ、その尊き使命に向つて第二の國民の敎養に當るとき日本の前途は更に洋洋として磐石の重きを加へるのであります。
今や聖戰旣に四年半島は老いも若きも眞の皇國臣民としての自覺のもとに內鮮一體ガツチリと手を取り合つて聖戰遂行に邁進致して居ります。殊に愛國の熱情止み難き半島の熱血の靑年は志願兵制度實施と共に之に應じ、年を追ふ每に志願者は激增の一途を迪り、而も幸に選ばれたる志願兵諸子は帝國軍人の名譽のために專心軍務に勉勵し、一部は聖戰に從事して赫赫たる戰功を樹て旣に二柱の尊き護國の英靈をさへ出して居る狀況であります。私共はこれ等志願兵の淚ぐましき奮鬪を見るにつけてもその陰に半島の年老いたる母や年若き妻の大いなる自覺と激勵のひそんで居ることを考へて、半島の全女性に感謝と共に更に大なる期待をもつものであります
彼の故李仁錫上等兵の母が愛兒の戰死の報を耳にしつゝも何等取亂す樣子もなく、たゞ我兒の手柄の程を案じたと言ふが如き、又夫を志願兵として送りたる年若き妻が朝夕寒天に水を浴びて夫の立派な御奉公を祈願したと言ふが如き、更に我兒の死をも顧みずその遺志を同鄕の志願兵某に傳へて二人前の御奉公を懇願した片田舍の一母の如き全く目覺めたる半島女性の意氣を示したものと言ふべく、傳へきゝていよく半島女性への期待を厚くするのであります。そして私共は更に多くの第二第三の斯ぅした女性が半島の名譽と共に現はれることを信んじて疑はないのであります。
半島女性よ、あなた達が抱けるそのいとしき子供達がよき母の感化と共に、健かに直く正しく、すくくと生ひ立つて多難なる國家の前に雄々しく出ひ立つ日を女性に與へられた唯一のよろこびとして待たぅではありませんか。＜47＞
志願兵家庭에 表彰
三千家庭에 贈呈하다
육군특별지원병은 半島人 청년의 憧憬의 的이 되었으며, 선발시험때가 되면 血書의 탄원서를 각 도지사에게 제출하여 합격을 희망하는 청년이 상당히 많으며, 訓練所生을 낸 가정은 府邑面民으로부터 羨望되고 있는데, 금번 愛國婦人會朝鮮本部에서는 이 영예의 가정을 표창하는 의미로 日章밑에 「陸軍特別志願兵名譽之家」라고 記한 縱五寸三分, 橫二寸二分의 標札을 증정키로 되었고, 우선 1일에 全朝鮮에 2천개를 付送하였다. 未調査의 가정에 대해서는 조사하는대로 付送할 터인데 3천개를 돌파할 모양이다.

時局重大化와 半島婦人
朝鮮軍報道部陸軍少佐  蒲勳
세계대전에 際한 歐米 각국이 전쟁의 수행 又는 국가 장래를  위하여 특히 부인교육에 힘을 써온 것은 우리가 임이 숙지하고 있는 바이다. 그 중에도 종래 保守國으로 인정되여온 英國에서까지도 부인이 사회 각 방면에 亙하여 활동하게 되었다.
我日本婦人은 옛날부터 가정인으로서 良妻賢母의 위대한 많은 미덕을 남기고 있으나, 일단 비상시국에 이르고본즉, 婦人손수가 街頭와 직장에 진출하여 여러 가지 방면에 활동하고 있는 것은 실로 감격할 일이다. 특히 출정군인가족의 奮鬪的 생활, 例하면 남편을 대신하며 형제를 대신하여 씩씩하게 농업과 상업에 종사하며, 혹은 군수품, 기타 여러 가지 공장에 있어서 힘써 일하는 부인들의 씩씩한 모양은 실로 눈물겨운 일이라 생각한다. 이들이 이렇게 일하는데 따라, 一家의 생활를 지지할 뿐 아니라 여기에 의하여 봉사의 생활을 하며 또는 내집에서 出征한 남자에게 뒤에 걱정없이 하여 국가를 위해서 즐겁게 其身命을 받치게 하는 것이다.
나는 때때로 전사한 분들의 고별식에서 상복을 입은 젊은 부인이 數人의 어린것들과 함께 남편영전에 서는 것을 보는 때 저 어린것들을 어머니 손 하나로서 길러갈 苦心을 살피고, 前途에 닥쳐올 여러 가지 困難을 상상하고, 부디 「神神의 도움이 있어지라」고 빌지 않을 수 없었다.
기타 일반부인도, 남자의 생활이 非常히 多忙하게 되어온 오늘날에는 처자와 함께 서서히 가정생활을 즐길수 없는 남자는 기반없다고 해도 좋으리라 생각하기 때문에 가정생활의 태반의 全책임은 자연 여자가 질머지지 않으면 안되게 되고, 교육상 문제는 물론 경제상 문제 公에 대한＜48＞ 업무책임의 수행까지만 해도 남편대신으로 처리하지 않으면 안된다.
이런 복잡다단한 생활사이에 아이들을, 盡忠報國에 국민으로서 교육해가지 않으면 안될 책임과 의무를 하등 불평도 없이 孜孜黙黙히 봉사의 생활을 영위해가는 것이 일본부인이다. 이것이 일본국민성과 전통적 정신이 된 今日의 興隆의 일본이요 世界一의 일본이 된 중대한 요인이다. 반도부인자매가 크게 배우고 크게 奮起하지 않으면 안될 점이라 생각한다.
아시는 바와 같이 我國은 세계중 如何한 나라에도 比類없는 존귀한 나라라는 것은 우리 皇國臣民의 가장 자랑하는 바이나, 특히 일단 有事를 당하고 본즉 我國의 고마움이 더한층 명백히 나타나는 것이다. 생명을 皇國에 받은 것이라는 것으로 더 느끼는 것이다. 그러나 이 사실은 이번 事變 경우에만 限하지않고 皇國2천6백년의 역사상에도 자못 그 예가 많다.
半島婦人姉妹여! 자매가 천황폐하의 赤子로서 또는 비상시 大日本國民의 일원으로서 자기의 현재 하고 있는 일이, 과연 이래서 좋을 것이냐고 三省해보시라고 하고 싶다.
우리는 大日本國의 臣民으로서 황실을 중심으로 하여 나라는 생각을 끊어버리고 身名을 천황을 위하여 받치기에 노력하고 서로 힘을 합하여 9천만 동포는 굳게 결합하여 동양인이 행복하게 생활하여 보담 나흔 행복을 얻는 새로운 동양을 건설하는 大信念에 불타, 높고 귀한 정의의 길을 걸으려고 하는 以上 이 길을 뚫어 최후의 광명과 행복을 확보할 것을 믿고 죽는 경우에까지의 艱難辛苦를 잊고 분투노력을 계속하고 있질 않은가.
半島婦人姉妹여! 諸氏의 노력은 新東洋建設의 시국에 국민으로서 과연 충분히 진력하고 있는가 생각해보라고 하고싶다.
또 母親으로서 자식이 장래 국가를 질머질 수 있고, 또 천황폐하의 赤子로서 非常時 大日本國民으로서 훌륭히 천황폐하를 위하여 생명을 바치는 이 日本精神을 자식에게 주는가, 옛날부터「귀여운 자식에게 길을 걸리라」「艱難은 너를 맨든다」라는 俚諺이 있든 것같이 자식을 기르는데는 애정에 눈뜬 진정한 愛에서 출발하지 않으면 안된다고 생각한다. 내 자식을 장래 국가의 中堅을 맨들고 죽는 때에, 아름답게 천황폐하를 위해서 죽는다는 숭고하고 위대한 愛가 모친에게 없으면 자식을 훌륭한 청년으로 길러낼 수가 없다. 괴로우리라, 가엽다든가,＜49＞ 소위 일시적 哀憐의 정에 끌려서 자식의 마음대로 길으는 사랑은 모친의 참사랑이 아니기 때문에 俚諺에 「祖母가 길른 아이는 팔아도 서푼밖에 안된다」라는 말이 있는 것과 같이 이런 溫床的 사랑의 교육을 시킨 자식은 커서 어떤 방면에든지 쓸데없는 것은 옛날부터 입신출세한 자나 혹은 귀신을 울린이만치 偉勳을 세운 靖國神社의 신으로 모시운 양반은, 모다, 어릴때부터 試鍊한 일본정신과 단련된 체격을 갖인 이로서 거진 얌전한 모친의 溫床的 교육을 받은 자는 一人도 없었다. 고로 부자집 자식이나 지위가 높은 집 자식에겐 흔히 낭비만 하고 단련하는 것이 없기 때문에 타락한 자가 얼마든지 있다. 아무리 재산과 지위를 남긴다드래도 자식에게 단련된 체격과 최후의 힘은, 死라고 오직 一死뿐이이라고 이렇게 정신을 넣어주지 않으면 사회에 나와서도 인간으로서의 값은 전연 인정할 수 없다. 모친의 주의할 것은 여기라고 생각한다.
자식을 단련하는 도중에는, 혹은 哀憐의 정에 견디지 못하는 일도 있겠으나, 모친 스스로가 연약한 마음을 먹지 말고 자식을 善히하기 위해서 溫床的 愛를 눌르지 않으면 안된다. 이런 모친의 참사랑에서 아이가 자연대로 잘아고 아이의 天分이 충분히 발휘된다. 이런 모친의 위대한 사랑에는 반드시 효도가 있는 것이다. 「어버이를 잊지않고, 자식을 잊지않고, 국가를 잊지않고, 神을 잊지않고, 자기를 잊지않고」라는 대일본의 仁恕의 道가 명백히 서게 된다.
이 의미에 있어서 청년훈련이라든가 병력은 국민으로서 어린이에게 死를 초월하여 자기의 本務에 매진하는 소위 시련된 정신을 주며 단련된 신체를 작성함에는 가장 효과적이라고 생각한다.
아시는 바와 같이, 我國군대는 세계각국에 比類 없는 군대다. 즉 我國군대는 천황께옵서 직접 御統率하옵시는 천황폐하의 군대임으로 皇威를 세계에 發揚하고 국가를 보호하는 군대며 皇道를 세계에 廣張하고 國德을 우주에 발휘하려는 군대다. 고로 죽는 것이 사라돌아오는 것이라는 마음을 갖인 것이 군대의 정신이다. 그러기 때문에 차별도 없이 文武의 別도 없이 최다 軍民一體로서 천황폐하에게 신명을 받치는데 我황군의 가치가 있고, 또 일본민족의 본질이 있다.
고로 兵役은 我국민의 의무요 또 권리라고 생각한다. 마치 국민은 옥치면 군대가 되고, 펼치면 국민이 되는＜50＞ 것이다.
이런 까닭에 日本남자로서 병력에 服하는 것은 남자로서 이상 명예는 없다고 생각할 뿐 아니라, 국민이 똑같이 그렇게 생각하고, 더 나가서의 국민이라는 것을 잊어서는 안된다.
그런데 작년 반도에 陸軍特別志願兵令이 시행되며 반도동포도 帝國軍人으로서 皇威를 발양하며 국가를 보호하는 兵役에 服하는 길을 얻은 것은 국가를 위해서 又는 반도동포를 위해서 참으로 경축하지 않을 수 없다. 본제도는 완전한 兵役法 적용이 아니나, 지원에 의해서 한번 兵役에 服한 光榮을 입은 후에는 其신분의 取扱及服役에 관해서는 일반징병에 의한 兵員과 동일 무차별임으로 일반장병같이 신명을 御奉公하는 것이 된다. 또 그 사람의 勞力과 努力에 의하여 하사관도 되고 혹은 장교도 됨으로 우리는 지원병에 대한 지원자는 각 방면에서 많이 나오리라 생각했는데, 결과로 보아서는 우리의 예상이 마저 떨어지지 못한 셈이다.
즉 中流이상의 가정이라든지, 부자집에서는 지원자가 전혀 나오지 않는다고 해도 과언이 아니다. 이들은 자기들이 지원병제도와 징병제도의 실시를 요구했음에도 불구하고 실시가 되자, 자기의 자제나 형제는 지원시키지 않과 가만히 있는 것은 딱한 일이 아니라 할 수 없다.
何故로 자제를 지원시키지 않느냐고 其 이유를 생각하면, 나는 옛날 조선식 생각 즉 文을 귀히 역이고 武를 천하게 생각하는 데서가 아닌가 또는 兵隊는 전쟁에 나가는 것임으로, 戰死를 하니까, 내보내지 않는 것이 아닌가 또 하나는 소위 溫床的 愛에서가 아닌가 생각한다. 어느 것이나 다-個人主義 自由思想으로서 시대를 인식하지 않는 것도 심함으로 황국신민으로서 도저히 言語道斷이다. 이런 생각을 한 시각이래도 빨리 一掃시키고 자식으로 하여금 너는 천황폐하 馬前에서 명예의 戰死를 하고오라는 정신이 없는 한, 어느때까지든지 반도인은 7천만의 內地同胞와 한가지로 걸어갈 훌륭한 황국신민은 될 수 없을 뿐 아니라, 半島同胞는 더욱더 時勢에 뒤떨어지고 말 것이다.
금일 대일본국민은 세계를 상대로 동양평화를 위해서 동양인이 훌륭한 동양인으로서 행복을 받을 수 있게 신질서 있는 건설을 하기 위하여 신명을 천황폐하께 받이고 귀한 骨을 내놓고 血을 흘리는 것이 아닌가. 여기에 反하여 반도동포는 銃後의 노력을 하고 있으나, 아직＜51＞
내지동포의 결사적 노력에 대해서는 및히지 못한다.
최근 軍需景氣를, 여러분이 여실히 목격하고 있는 바와 같이 好景氣임으로 我國의 고마움을 알고 더욱 느끼고 있다.
이것은 말씀디리기도 황공하지만 御稜威外엔 다른 것이 없다. 그렇지만 우리가 忠勇無雙의 連戰連勝의 덕택이 아니고 무엇일까. 其 은혜를 알고 조금이래도 보은의 念에 불타는 사람이라면, 중류이상의 가정, 특히 부자집은 지원병제도에 대하여 얼마쯤은 이해를 가지고 있으리라 생각한다. 이 때에 생각을 돌려주었으면 한다.
나는 여러분의 자식을 빨리 日本精神 試鍊의 분위기에 넣어 皇國臣民으로서 서게 하려는 것이고, 또 일본남자의 영광이요, 자랑인 皇軍의 간부인 하사관이나 장교를 시키고 싶음에서다. 이것 때문에는 지원병을 지원시키는 외엔 好期會가 없으리라 생각한다. 다음으로, 청년훈련이다. 청년훈련은 청년의 신체를 단련하고, 정신을 연마하고 국가를 위하여 집을 위하여 죽기까지 노력할 기백을 가진 참된 역할을 할 수 있는 훌륭한 청년을 작성하는 것이다. 이 청년훈련은 세계각국에서 盛히 실시하고 있다. 內地에 있어서도 청년으로서 청년훈련을 끊치고 병력에 服하지 않으면 한사람의 청년이라고 인정할 수 없다.
일른 말이지만, 사위를 택하는 제일요건은 병력에 服하고 청년훈련을 맟인 사람으로 되어있다. 여러분이 자식을 여하한 방면에 내놓아도 또는 여하한 간난에 접하드래도 훌륭히 성공하며 일단 有事際에는 일본남자답게 君國을 위해서 분투노력하며, 너머지드래도 다시 일어날 기백을 가지게 하고 싶으면 청년훈련을 받게 하는 것이 近道다.
過般 지원병 검사에 대해서 청년훈련을 받은 자는, 그 동작과 언어태도가 실로 훌륭하고 뛰어나서 좋왔다는 이야기를 들었다. 여러분이 정말 자식을 여하한 방면에 내세우든지 남에게 떨어앉지는 참된 훌륭한 사람을 만들고싶고 또 국가를 위해서 훌륭히 御奉公시키고 싶다고 생각하거든 청년훈련소에 넣는 것이 좋겠다.
이상은 이번 지원병채용검사에 있서어 지원자가 말한 것을 듣고 모친이 지원을 반대하는 것이 비상히 많다는 것을 알고 그래서는 안되겠다는 것을 특히 말씀한 것이다.
兵隊가 부족하기 때문에 내가 여러분께 권하는 것이 아니다.＜52＞
內地에는 국군이 요구하는 징병수를 취하고도 청년은 남는다. 또 전쟁에 나아간 兵隊도 조선에서 보는 바와 같이 內地에도 병영이 있는 곳에는 전쟁전보다 많으면 많었지 적지는 않다. 我國은 이쯤한 전쟁에서 허덕이지않는 나라다. 我國은 예로부터 兵隊는 무장한 군대고 국민은 무장하지 않은 군대임으로 그 정신은 공통의 일본정신으로 되어있다. 그러기 때문에 日淸, 日露전쟁을 비롯해서 외국과 싸와서 지금까지 패해본 일은 한번도 없는 나라다. 금번 전쟁도 이제로부터인데 가령 세계열국이 我國을 처오드래도, 국민전부가 무장한 군대와 같이 천황폐하를 위해서 즐겁게 죽는다는 아름다운 일본정신에 불타있음으로 승리는 우리에게 있다.
무슨 일에나 성취함에는, 안락을 꾀하며 死를 무서워해서는 안 된다. 끝까지 죽는다는 분투노력이 아니면 안된다. 우주의 정신은 死를 부러워안하는 분투노력없이 어느 구석에 백혔는지도 모른다.
반도동포가 황국신민이 되는 길은 간단하다. 즉 자기의 신명을 천황폐하에게 받치는 것이다. 즉 일본정신 체득실천에 있다.
자식을 사랑하고 장래의 광명과 행복을 염원한다면 일본정신 시련장이요, 實踐踐場인 병영에 보내주시라. 이것이 모친의 참된 사랑이요 반도동포의 행복이다.
이것이 내가 여러분께 말씀하는 정신이다.

志願兵の母姉の方に呈する言葉
國民精神總動員朝鮮聯盟理事 鄭僑源

男子として生を亨けた以上は男子としての本分を盡さなければならない。男子の本分中其の最大のものは何と云ふても軍人として國防の重責に任することであらぅ。然るに今までの半島靑年は此の國防の任務を果すの機會に惠まれなかつたのである。特別志願兵制度の創始は即ち半島靑年に對し男子の本分を盡すの途と無限の光明を與へられたのである。さり＜53＞乍らこの事は朝鮮としては 絶へてなかつた事なのて中には木人に於て熱烈なる盡忠報國の志念に燃えの志願なるにも拘らず、制度の眞義を解せざる母姉近親にょつて沮止せられんとした例がないてもなかつた。思ふに此等母姉の人々は兵隊と云ふと直ぐ戰死を聯想し、自分の可愛い子供を死なせ度くないと云ふ心理が作用したのであらぅが、兵隊になつたからとて直ぐ戰死する譯でもない。出征すれば勿論生還を期なしない意氣が乍併人間一生誰ぞ能く死なからんやである。盖し戰死は人間の內で最淸最高の死に方である、假りに志願兵が戰死することがあつても最善至高の義務の義務を盡しての死であるから、本人自身は勿論一家一門一鄕の極りなき榮譽であつて、其の功積は所謂竹帛に輝き永遠の生命を持つことになるのである。制度創始以來の志願兵の母姉の方々が克く此等の道理を體得せられ軍人の母姉としての心盡しを盡し志願者をして概ね良好なる成積を以て終始するをことに資せられたるは吾人の衷心より敬服する所である。

故李仁錫上等兵を弔ふの文

故李上等兵の壯烈なる戰死は近世朝鮮人の中で最も尊き死に方である。李君の死によつて新東亞建設と云ふ聖なる目標に向つて奮進しつつある。一億同胞は內鮮一體更に一層團結を擧固にし聖戰目的の完遂に全力を傾注するの決意を新にされた感がある。李君が敵の重圍中にあつて華々しい活動を爲し敵彈にょり重傷負ふた瞬間に於ても聖戰目的の貫徹を念願し陛下の萬歲を奉唱しつゝ北支戰線の花と散つたことは何と云ふ勇壯義烈な姿であらぅか、君の死は畏くも 天聽に達し御思召にょり君が靈は旣に靖國の神として祀られ、鄕土の稱讚尊崇亦至らざるなしである。
尙半島現在及將來の靑年は君を■鑑として永久追慕措く能はざる苦であるから君は死せるに非すして永遠無限の生命を半島靑年の腦衷に植付けたと云ふても過言てはなからう。謹みて御冥福を祈る次第である。＜54＞

志願兵母姉に望む
總督府社會敎育課長 李家源甫

一昨年春實施せられた陸軍特別志願兵制度は我が半島にとつて最も光榮ある劃期的出來事として深く民心に印象づけられたものでありましたが此れに依つて半島二千三百萬の同胞は眞に 陛下の股肱として國防の大任を擔ひ得るの新しい途が拓かれたのであります。
玆に於て私達は今後いかにして此の有難き聖旨に對へ奉るベきかに就いて深く思いを致さねばならないと存ずるのであります。
御承知の如く只今、日本は戰時體制下にあるのでありまして戰線にある將兵は勿論、銃後にあつて文字通り此等勇士の後楯ともなるベき國民がともに協力して今同の聖戰の目的に對し深い理解と決意を以て進むのでなければ何としても所期の目的を達成することは出來ないのであります。こゝに「一視同仁」に基く志願兵制度の意義が益々重要性を加へてくると共に此等志願兵の母であり又姉である家庭の方方の確固たる心構へが要望せられてくるのであります。何と中しましても婦人は常に皇國の母として又皇國の妻としての覺悟を有たねばならないのでありまして、特に今日の樣に國民の總力戰の叫ばれてゐる時に婦人心がけが戰爭の圈外に立つといふことは日本國民として絶體に出來ないし、又其のいふことが許されるべき筈のものではないのであります。
且ての歐洲大戰に於ける獨逸の悲慘な戰收の原因が銃後を護るべき婦人の氣力喪失にあつたといふことを更めて想起すべきであります。斯の樣に婦人の立場は其の國家にとつて非常に重要なものでありまして昔から其の國の消長を決定づけてゐたといふことは旣に世間周知の通りであります。
斯ぅいふ點から見まして、今回選ばれて 陛下のおほみ栒となり眞の國難を背負つて立つ忠勇なる帝國軍人としての志願兵諸君に心から慰安と激勵の言葉を與へ此れを力強くのばしてやるといふことは現下半島の婦人に與へられた名譽ある＜55＞つとめだと存ずるものであります。
どうか其の點とくと御諒承あつて靑年達ののび上がらうとする正しい氣持をどこまでも助長してやり、ともに皇國の臣民にしての矜りを以て強く明るく家庭の建設、ひいては皇國の發展の爲不退轉の努力をつくされんことを特に祈つて己まない次第であります。

私の感激したる志願兵の母
朝鮮防共協會主事 三輪和太郞

朝鮮陸軍特別志願兵として、金光鍊君が幾多の志願者の中から撰び出され、第一期訓練生として國境近い咸鏡北道慶興の故鄕を後にしたのは昭和十三年。季節は夏の盛りでありました。
其の頃、金君のお母さんは、志願兵制度の事は判つて居たのですが、金君を志願させる事は、可愛いゝ我子を膝下から手放す事であり、遉がに心配が先立つて、直ぐには決め兼ねて居たのでした。
然し淚さへ瞳に宿し、懇願する光鍊の熟望に、遂に母の心も動かされ遂に承諾されたのでした。
そして其年の七月の末、あの張鼓峯事件が突發したのであります。
張鼓峯に間近い慶興は、戰鬪地區となつて、敵彈が三方から飛んで來る許りでなく、後には爆擊機が飛來して爆彈を盲ら落しに投下するのでした。
我が第一線部隊はソ聯軍が國境線む越えて侵入して來るのも抑へて、逆に反擊を加へ、攻擊を開始しました。
處が、我が軍が進めば進む程、敵の砲火は激しくなつて來る許りです。
國境に住む人達も今は唯、軍隊の働きのみを默つて見ては居られぬと、自衛團を初め、老年も若きも村中總出で、彈丸運びや糧食運搬、或ひは傳令の劇務迄引き受けて、汗と泥に塗れ年ら協同の働きを始めたのでした。
然し、尙ソ聯軍は、飛行機や砲擊を增して來るので、部落＜56＞は至る處爆彈砲彈の炸裂で、まるでこの世のものとは思はれぬ光景でありました。
そこで、一先づ老人や婦女子は安全な處に引揚げる樣にと警察から避難命令が出ました。
其の時金君のお母さんも亦、近處の人達と一緖に、着のみ着のまゝで、直ちに裏山の松林の中へ避難して、炸裂する彈丸の叫びを胸を戰かせて見てゐました。
パアーツと砂廛を舞ひ上げる爆彈、敵機の地上掃射の機銃彈が、トタン屋根を射ち拔く音、光、土煙、■廛この息づまる樣な光景を眼前にして、急に氣になつて來たのは、我が子の光鍊が戰線に立つ場合の事でした。
今は訓練生である光鍊が、何日何時この妻じい戰線に立つて戰はねばならぬかと思ふと、戰線の樣子が氣に懸り、
「あゝ、今出ては危い、危いー」
と、人の止めるのを振り切つて岩の隙間や墓石の間から體を乘り出して、豆滿江の對岸笫一線の樣子をジーツと視詰めて居るのでした。
味方の地上射擊を警戒する敵の飛行機は、十二三機から 多い時には 三十五機餘りの編隊で、所嫌はず爆彈の雨を降らせるのでした。
直ぐ眼下の慶興國際橋を爆擊しようと投下した爆彈は、橋より下流の柳並木二三木を仆したきりで、いたづらに河原に大穴をあける許りでした。
その時、敵の地上部隊では空襲に力を得て、數十臺のタンクを先頭に、步兵部隊がそれよりか下流に當る張鼓峯に向つて進んで行くのが見えるのです。
「あゝ、あんなに澤山敵が出て來たが、大丈夫だらうか」
と、はらくして見てゐるお母さんの頭上をグウーツとウナリを立てゝ飛んで行つた味方の砲彈は、二發三發、パツパツと白煙と上げると次々に命中し、十二三發で、敵のタンクは或は腹を見せて橫たはり、或は穴に頭を突込み、殆んど全部働けぬ樣になつて了ひました。すると、我軍の步兵が何時の間に行つてゐたのか、クサムラからムクくと起ち上つで、タンクに飛びついて、手擲彈を投げつけたり、揮發油で火を點けたりしました。
燃え上つたタンクからは、何時迄もムクくと眞黑な煙りを吹き出して居ました。
地上部隊を粉碎された敵は、今度は空軍を動員して、躍氣の地上掃射や盲爆を繰り返へすのでした。
我が軍の陣地はと見れば、＜57＞
「何をするか、五月蠅い奴だ！」
と謂つた調子で平氣で塹壕を堀つたり道を直したりして、全く當の日の演習と變らぬ態度で、規律正しく働いてゐるのが手に取る樣に見えるのです。
最早や、恐怖も忘れて、全身を乘り出して、
「あゝ、立派なものざや、感心しました-」
といふ金さんのお母さんの聲に、今迄引き止めてゐた近處の婦人達も、一人立ち二人集りして、何時の間にか、皆、展望所の下に登つて來て。
「ほれごらん。先頭の飛行機も煙を吐く-そら 又隊落した、巧い巧い」
と喊聲を擧げ、拍手迄して、我軍の射擊の正確さを褒めただえるのでした。

そして、月日は流れて、
それは昭和十三年冬枯の吹く十二月も半ば頃でした。優秀な成積で訓練所む出所した金君が、晴れて陸軍步兵として、○○隊へ入營をする日が來ました。
その日風邪氣味で休んでゐた金君のお母さんは、
「今日は光鍊の入營する日だ。一度入隊すれば、何時出征するかも知れぬ、今逢はねばもう逢へぬかも知れない」
と病を推して、はるばる羅南迄遺つて來たのでした。驛は、兒島知事下出迎への人達で身動きも出來ぬ程でした。
聽て、京城發の急行列車は出迎の人々の歡呼を浴びてブラツトホームに人つて來ました。
そして、一極人眼を惹く志願兵四十餘名が、陽燒けした面を輝やかせて引率官に伴はれ、列車から下リて來ました。
お母さんは眼を輝かせて、一人々々の志願兵の顔を見て行きましたが、どれを見ても我が子の樣であり、又皆が、日本の兵隊さんの樣で、金君の姿は見付かりませんでした。
「おや、光鍊はどうしたのだらう。あの子丈一人が病氣にでも成つて遲れたのであらうか？ 若しさうだとしたら何といふ情けない事たらうか、人一培元氣者のあれが今日に限つて、いやくそれとも私の見落しではなからうか。」
お母さんは半ば失望し乍らも、愛し子の姿を夢中で探し求めるのでした。
その中に、
「氣を付け、番號！」
「一、二、三、四、五、六.........」
「全員異狀ありません」＜58＞
「 ――」
と、默呼が終ると、引率官は、
「今から十五分間休憩し、其間に面會人のある者は自由に逢つてよろしい。正九時此處に集合し、氣を付け、別れ」
と、どうでせう。お母さんの直ぐ前に居た志願兵の一人が、
「お母さん-」
と懷し想に呼び掛けて來るではありませんか、お母さんは吃驚しました。
「おー光鍊、お前は此處に居たのかい-」
と漸く叫ぶ樣に云ふのでした。
目鼻立ちもクツキリと引締り、今迄の吾が子とは、何と變た立派な面影でせう。その元氣な、日燒けした顔が母の淚の中に大きく寫し出されて來たのです。
併し面會時間が今は十五分しかないのです。つかの間の逢瀨に、母は光鍊の手をシツカリと取ると、
「光鍊や、許してお吳れ、お母さんは判らなかつたので、本當に心配したんだよ。どんなに探したことでせう。でも吾が子の顔が判らないなんて.........」
さう云つて、笑はうとすればする程、瞼が熱くなつて、涙が溢れて來るのをどうする事も出來ませんでした。
「あゝ、御前は其の間 食物は十分に喰べられたかい？、病氣はしなかつたらうね-、訓練は苦しくなかつたかい」
それに答へる光鍊君の顔が元氣良く笑つてゐるのを見ればそれは聽く迄もない事です。
「でも、御母さん、あの張鼓峯事件の時は隨分心配したんだよ。お母さんは、お前が第一線に出て、若しもの事があつたら-と、夜も碌々眠れなかつたんだよ」
「お母さん、有難う。でももう、そんな心配は御無用です。自分は今日から、大日本帝國の軍人です。立派に 天皇陛下の御栒と成つたからには、一日も早く出征する事を希望してゐます。そして、戰線に立つたら誰にも負けない働きをする覺悟でゐます。之からは、お母さんも、そういふ間違つた心配をなさつてはいけまサん。自分達一人々々が眞に皇國臣民となるは爲に、自分達は眞先に身命を拋げ打つて國家の爲に盡す覺悟でゐるめです」
光鍊君は、さう決意の程を面に表はして云ひました。
ジツと瞳をうるませて、聞いてゐたお母さんは、うちへる感激に聲もふるへて、
「光鍊、お母さんはよく判りました。先刻お前の顔を見た時からもうそれは判つてゐたが、判然その言葉を聞いて、お＜59＞母さんも嬉しく思ひます。お母さんはお前が生れた時から懷に抱いて、唯お前が泣いたり、「アーガー」と云ふ丈で、わ乳が欲しいのか、お腹が病いのか判つで居たのだもの、何でお前の氣持が判らない筈がありませう。お母さんにはよく判りました。だから、お前も之からは決して私の事なんかは心配しないで、一生懸命御奉公するのですよ」
軍國の母の眞心の強さ、其の我子を愛する純い心-それがその儘國を愛する心にも通つてゐるのであります。
こうした親子の再會の美はしい光景に、今迄遠慮して席を離れてゐた面長さんを始め、有志の人達は改めて金君を迎へました、
「やあ、金君、立派になりましたなあ、之からは皇國軍人としてシツヵリ遺つて下さい。私達の分迄も倂せて働いて國家に盡して下さい」
と口々に勵ませば、金君は、
「ハツ、ハツ」
と擧手の禮をして、それに答へるのでした。
「皆さん、有難う御座居ます。光鍊もどんなに嬉しい事でせう」
そう云つてお母さんは、出迎への人々に向ふと
「音は私は、あの張鼓峯事件からと云ふものは、吾が子の身が案じられて、今が今迄心の中では、出來る事なら光鍊を手許に返へしたい-恥も外間も構はないから、此處からでも連れて歸へられたら-とさへ思つてゐました。處が今此の光鍊の立派な姿を見、その決心を聞いて、今迄の考へがどんたに間違つてゐたか取越苦勞であつたかが、ハツキリ判りました。それて又、自分でも不思議な位安心が出來ました。いゃ唯だ安心が出來た許りではありません。次男の吉鍊も昨年小學校を卒業した許りですが、あれもその年になりましたら、必ず同じ志願兵として差し出しまして、御奉公させて頂く覺悟で居ります。此の事を、今玆で改めて面長樣初め皆樣の前に御誓ひ於します」
母のこの健氣な決意に、金光鍊君は如何許り勵まされた事であらう。並居る人々の力へ向つて擧手の敬禮をした金君の眼には、大粒の淚が光つてゐるのでありました。
然し、早くもその時、
「集れー」
と引率官の方から號令が下りました。
一瞬とも思はれる僅か十五分間、その間に人々が淚と共に受けた感激は、如何に大きなものであつたでせう。＜60＞
「では皆樣御機■良く-」
「お母さん、行つて參ります」
聲掛られて、母は泣くまいとジツト溢れ來る淚を押へて、愛し兒を見送るのでした。
私も丁度此の時、傍で此の光景を目擊しまして、目頭を熱くし、「眞に日本軍人の强さは、軍國の母の强さである」と、强く感じたのでありました。
そして、『海征かば-』聲に送られて行く金君以下四十名の志願兵に對し、心からその健康と、武運長久とを祈つたのでありました。-終-

皆樣こそまことの犠牲、まことの奉公の鑑！
梨花女子專門學校校長 金活蘭

志願兵の母姊皆樣

いとしさ、可愛さにおきましてががへのない自分の事自分の弟の進んで行くみちくに別した仕合はせの訪れを祈るのは誰しものことでございませう。しかしこのいとしさ、この可愛さのはんとうに正しいしあはせを人達はなみしてはなりますまい。何かの一つものに心を高めて敬ぬ處にかづくことを忘れた心の驕りをともしますと人の子はもつものださうではありませせぬか。けれどもこのやうな心のおごりを唯はしいまゝにはびこる雜草のやうに生ひ凝らせてはその御當人には正しいしあはせはめぐまれません筈だと存ぜられます。はたまた其生みのちゝはゝの、血を分けた兄弟姊妹、ひいてそのやうなものを構成なりとする國家社會は眞正な安心立命が期せられることで御座いませう。このやうな考へ方をしますわたくしはあなた方の小さいせまい自分の世界を大きい廣い世界の中に導さ入れて前に中しました、ほんとうの意味でのしあはせを御自分體得せられつゝあられることと察せられましていひやうのない心の躍りを覺えます。國家の干城となるといふことはどういふ意味に於きましても本懷のことでござ＜61＞いませう。さうした子弟を國に捧げられた皆樣の御本懷もさこそと推察いたされます。よく犧牲と申し奉公といはれてゐますが色々な意味でさだめし御不自由もあられませうところをひたすら國家の安寧を會はれて御子弟をその干城に勇み立たせた皆樣こそまことの犧牲まことの奉公の鑑でございませう、深ひ感謝と敬意とを捧げずにはゐられません。どうぞ銃後の御からた御大事にあそばして御子弟の身の上にも正しいよい幸が臨みますやう祈つてやみません。

『死んで歸れ、墓守りはしてやろ』
綠旗聯盟婦人部 津田節子

志願兵となつて下さつた方々のお母樣やお姉樣に申し上げたいことは「よく出して下さつてありがたう」といふことと、「安心して待つてゐて下さい必ず立派な靑年となつて、あなたをお喜ばせする日が來ます」といふことであります。
噂さとか、人の話とかでは つきつめた本當のことが解りにくいのが世の中です。志願兵訓練所とはどんなところか、志願兵になるといふことはどんなことか、志願兵の生活はどんなものか、といふことはきつとあなた方に中々解りにくかつたでせう。ですのに、その解りにくい志願兵生活の中に、弟さんなりお子さんなりを送り込んで下さつたあなた方は、勇氣があつたと思ひます。これからあともその勇氣を失はないで下さい。
私は滿少佐からも、海田大佐からも志願兵訓練所のお話を同ひ、見學した方のお話もきゝました。そして强く感じたことは「學校だ」といふことでした。みなさん、志願兵訓練所は、日本靑年の正しい生活を敎へる學校ですよ。私はさう思ひます。「たから、もう暫く勇氣を出して待つてゐて下さると、この靑年達は立派な敎育を愛けて-それは頭だけや口光きだけやノートの筆記や見せかけだけでない所の-眞劍な生活の指導を受けて、再びあなた方の前に立ちます。＜62＞
訓練は苦しい事もあるでせう。鐵も打たれて强くなるのです。人間も鍛へられてえらくなるのです。志願兵訓練所といふ生活學校は、日本男子を作り上げる學校であり、且朝から晩までの人間らしいよい生活を敎へる所です。こゝの訓練を受けた人と受けない人とは、打たれた鐵と打たれぬ鐵程のちがひか出來るでせう。これからの日木に是非必要な人間はしつかりした國體信念を持ち、本氣で力一杯生活する人間です。
朝起きてきちんと寢床を片づける靑年、定まつた規則通りに齒を磨き手を洗ふ靑年、よく嚙んで禮儀正しく御飯を頂き食器のあと始末までする靑年、さういふ靑年がこれからの半島に送り出されるといふことは、必ず半島の家庭生活を一新する基となるでせう。ましてその心にその魂に、皇國に對する鐵の如き信念が打ちこまれてゐるのですから、これこそ新日本をになふ第一の靑年達であります。
志願兵の方々は訓練所を卒業してから各隊に配屬され、又華々しく第一線にまで送り出される事でありませう。
「立派に死んで歸れ、墓守りは必ずしてやる「と海田大佐はお勵ましになつたといひます。立派な帝國軍人になる方ですもの。さうでせう。倂し又めでたく凱旋されたあかつきには半島生活革新の第一線の勇士であることを信じます。
お母様、お姉樣、
あなた方の弟さんやお子さんは、一つの家庭のよい子弟といふだけの生活から、一飛びに日本全體をになふ大きな貴い生活へ飛び込まれたのです。ありがたう。そこに私共の心からの感謝を捧げます。そして終りに再び中し上げます。もうしばらく待つて下さい。きつと立派な靑年となつてあなた方の前に立つ日があります。なまじつかな上級學校に行つて、ヵフエーの味や女の遊びを覺えて歸るより、立派な生活を身につけて歸つて來られる方がどんなによいかしれません。
淋しくても、手が足りなくても、しんはうして待つてゐて下さい。私は祈つて居ります。＜63＞
國防觀念과 尙武慹의 鼓吹
三千里社長  金東煥
고금의 역사를 뒤저보면 尙武精神이 강한 나라는 반드시 흥하고, 그 반면에 文弱에 흐르는 나라는 얼마가지 못하여서 망하여 버리는 것이 세상의 법인 듯 하여서, 근래에 여러분의 이목을 놀내게한 저 獨佛戰爭을 볼지라도 2천년동안을 切齒腐心하여가며 국민전체가 먹을 것 먹지 못하고 입을 것 입지 못하고서 포탄만들기에 兵式訓練 밧기에 진력하든 獨逸은 오늘 乘勝長驅, 佛蘭西들 정복하고 안젓지 안슴니까. 그 반대로 爛*한 문화와 富와 美에 도취하여서 그날 그날을 보내든 佛蘭西는 社稷을 힛들러의 軍門에 바치고, 그 백성들은 완전히 해체되다싶이 유랑의 民이 되여서 어제는 巴里에서 오늘은 즈-루로 또 내일은 보루도-로 朝夕으로 移轉하는 정부의 뒤를 따라서 피로, 낙망, 기아에 울면서 따라다니고 있음니다. 4천만이나 되는 佛국민은 어째서 이렇듯참담한 敗走를 하고 있음니까. 巴里는 총공격을 시작한지 겨우 여들에만에 함락되었다고 함니다 .巴里城 周回에는 그때 50만의 佛軍이 있었다하는데 어째서 최후의 一兵까지 首都와 국가를 사수하지 못하고서 아모런 큰 결정적 전쟁 한번 없이 이렇게도 맥이 없게 무기를 버리고 敗走하였음니까.
생각건대 佛蘭西군인의 머리에는 腦裏에 아름다운 처자와 葡萄酒와 榮華로운 가정과 즐비한 市街와 그래서 안일과 향락사상이 가득 차섰올 것이외다. 그러기에 나라를 위하여서 전쟁에서 이때 제묵숨을 버리는 것이, 이 모든 人世의 榮華를 버리는 것이 되야, 참아 앗가워 못하있든 것이외다. 그 결과는 제 목숨은 차치하고, 부모와 처자도 욕되게 하고, 국가는 영영 망하여 버리지 안었음니까, 국가를 잃은 뒤에 다시 어디 가서 佛蘭西의 富와 美와 행복과 영화를 찾을 것임니까.
佛蘭西가 이리된 이유에는 두가지 죄가 있는 줄 암니다. 한아는 국가와 사회가 모다 개인주의, 자유주의에 흘너서 국방관념을 등한히하여 國民訓練은 등한히한 탓이고
또 다른 하나는 佛蘭西의 어머니와 안해와, 처자가, 그 청년들을 문약하게 양육하여＜64＞ 내었든 까닭일 것임니다.
아직도 大戰은 계속되여 이제도 앞으로 몇나라가 더 없어지고, 몇 민족이 더 망하게 될는지 모를 것임니다. 그러나 결과에 있어선 尙武의 국가가 흥하고 文弱의 나라가 패망하여 버리리라하는 결론만을 불변할 것이외다.
반도의 여러 母姊시어, 이 사실을 보고 깊이 생각하여 주십시요. 지금 조선에는 지원병제도가 실시되어, 겨우 3년만에 벌서 그 지망자 10만을 헤이게 되엇스니 지금이야 바야으로 尙武精神이 한창 蔚興하는 때외다. 어서 성장한 子弟가 잇거든 한사람이라도 더 많이 지원시켜서 모도다 군복입혀 총메여 저 敎鍊하는 마당에 세워 주세요. 지금은 우리나라 일본이 동양에 새로운 체제를 세우려고 거룩한 聖戰을 이르키고 잇는 때이니 누구나 국방의 중책을 질머저야 할 것임니다. 이제 我제국의 武備만 더욱더욱 충실하다면 목표로하는 全亞細亞에 대한 신체제가 이 기회에 확립하여지는 때이니 제국의 번영과 행복을 日夜念頭에 두는 우리 국민으로서 엇지 국방사상과 尙武精神을 이때에 있어 등한히 할 바이리까.
어서 兵丁을 만드십시다. 자식을  兵丁으로 내보내어 그 목숨을 높으신 곳에 맛기어 나라 잘 되기에 쓰시도록 합시다. 나는 지원병 희망자 10만에 달한 이 기회에 半島母姊의 머리에 尙武精神이 용소슴치기를 더욱 간절히 바람니다.
