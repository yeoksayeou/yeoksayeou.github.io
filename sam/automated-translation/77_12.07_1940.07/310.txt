Collection of Famous Poems by China's Poetic Sages
						Yang Chu-dong et al.

Selections from the Book of Songs (詩傳抄)
Translated by Yang Chu-dong (梁柱東譯)

The Book of Songs (詩經) is a collection of over 300 pieces, ranging from musical scores used in the court and ancestral shrines above, down to folk songs sung in the villages and alleys below, spanning from the early Zhou Dynasty to the Warring States period. It truly forms the origin of Chinese literature and is said to have originally been compiled by Confucius.

According to Mao's Preface to the Book of Songs by Zixia, there have traditionally been Six Principles (六義) in poetry: namely, Feng (風), Fu (賦), Bi (比), Xing (興), Ya (雅), and Song (頌). However, among these, "Xing, Fu, Bi" are poetic techniques, while "Feng, Ya, Song" are poetic forms. "Feng" refers to the so-called folk songs of the alleys, often containing many love songs between men and women. The two Nan sections (Zhou Nan and Shao Nan) are called "Correct Feng" because they are "joyful but not licentious, sorrowful but not harmful" (Confucius). Those from Bei onwards are all Changed Feng (變風), among which the sounds of Zheng and Wei are said to be particularly licentious and have thus been condemned by Confucian scholars. However, in terms of the simple flavor and straightforwardness of folk songs, they possess many rather lovely aspects. "Ya" and "Song" are both musical songs for the court and suburban temples. The original meaning of Ya is "correct" (正), and because governance has major and minor aspects, there is a distinction between Minor Ya (小雅), <210> and Major Ya (大雅) (Zixia's Preface). Also, like Changed Feng, there is Changed Ya (變雅).

In this translation, I initially intended to select evenly from each form, but naturally, the folk song style "Feng" came to occupy the majority. Ya and Song are traditionally difficult and solemn, making them hard to translate, and even if translated, they would likely be quite dry for the general reader.

Ospreys

By the water's edge, the ospreys
Male and female cry to each other.
The beautiful young lady
Is a good match for the gentleman.

Uneven water chestnuts
Are sought here and there.
The beautiful young lady,
Awake or asleep, I long to obtain her.
Longing but unable to obtain,
Awake or asleep, I think of her.
Sorrow knows no bounds,
Tossing and turning, I do.

Uneven water chestnuts
Will be gathered here and there.
The beautiful young lady,
With zither and lute (琴瑟), I wish to befriend her.
Uneven water chestnuts
Will be prepared here and there.
The beautiful young lady,
With drums beating, I wish to enjoy her.

關關雎鳩, 在河之洲. 窈窕淑女, 君子好逑. <211>

*Note: The original text seems to have omitted parts of the standard "Guan Ju" poem here, jumping to lines from "Cao Chong" (草虫) below without clear separation or explanation, and also missing the second stanza of Guan Ju.*

*The following appears to be parts of "Cao Chong" (草虫) from the Shao Nan (召南) section of the Book of Songs:*

Anxious, anxious. Now that I have seen him, now that I have met him, my heart is calmed.

Climbing that southern hill, I say I'll gather ferns. Not having seen my lord, my heart is anxious and troubled. Now that I have seen him, now that I have met him, my heart is gladdened.

Climbing that southern hill, I say I'll gather vetches. Not having seen my lord, my heart is hurt and sad. Now that I have seen him, now that I have met him, my heart is eased.
(Shao Nan. Cao Chong 召南.草虫)

Selections from Du Zimei (杜子美抄)
Translated by Pak Chong-hwa (朴鍾和譯)

Five-character Quatrains (五言絶句)

Two Quatrains (絶句二首)

I
Long sun days, river and mountains beautiful,
Spring wind, flowers and grass fragrant.
Mud melts, swallows fly,
Sand warms, mandarin ducks sleep.

II
River green, birds whiter still,
Mountains blue, flowers seem to burn.
This spring, watching it pass again,
What day will be the year of return?

Translation:

In the mild spring weather, the white sunlit day is long.
The fresh water and mountains, picturesque and ever more beautiful.
In the gentle spring breeze, flowers and grass are fragrant.
In the melted mud patch, flying swallows chatter.
The sand grains are warm; a pair of mandarin ducks dozes affectionately.

The river water is deep blue, <214>
The water birds' color is even whiter.
The mountains stand tall and green, the azaleas seem to burn.
This spring passes heedlessly again,
On what day, they say, shall I return?

Returning Geese (歸鴈)

Spring comes, a traveler ten thousand li away,
Chaos settled, how many years until return?
Heartbroken wild geese over the river city,
Flying high, high towards the north.

Translation:

Though spring has come again,
The traveler ten thousand li away,
When will the chaos end, and I return?
Wild goose, lonely wild goose,
Wailing lonely wild goose,
Flying high, high to the north, lonely wild goose,
How sorrowful, how heart-wrenching, my heart aches.

Quatrain (絶句)

Strolling by the riverbank on the green grass ends,
Turning my head, I suddenly see military banners.
Wind rises in the twilight spring city,
From the high tower, the bugle's sound is sad.

Translation:

Treading the green grass by the riverbank,
Returning from the Qingming outing (踏靑),
I turn my head and suddenly see soldiers' flags.
In the darkening spring city, only the wind blows strong,
Oh, how sorrowful, the desolate bugle sound.

Six Quatrains (絶句六首) <215>

I
Sun rises over the water east of the fence,
Clouds form over the mud north of the house.
Tall bamboo rustles, kingfishers call,
Secluded sand, marsh birds dance.

II
Misty flowers, stamens in disarray,
Flitting bees and butterflies abound.
In the quiet tower, body lazy to move,
A guest arrives, what should I do?

III
Sudden rain fills the small stream,
Slanting sunbeams turn around the tree trunks.
Across the nest, yellow orioles sit side-by-side,
Overturning algae, white fish leap.

IV
Digging a well, crossing palm leaves (交*葉 - original text unclear, likely 棕櫚葉 - palm leaves),
Opening a ditch, cutting bamboo roots.
A small boat, lightly moored, bobs,
A small path winds towards the village.

V
Below the house, bamboo shoots pierce the wall,
Before the pavilion, wisteria pricks the eaves.
Ground dry, silk threads (spiderwebs?) drift slowly,
River white, grasses fine and delicate.

VI
River moves, moon shifts on the rocks,
Stream empty, clouds drift beside the flowers.
Birds roosting know the old path,
A passing sail, at whose house will it moor?

Translation:

I
The reddish round sun rises beyond the fence,
Rising white clouds reach the hillock.
Rustling, crying bamboo leaves, like kingfisher feathers,
In the quiet sandy gap <216>
Only water birds cry.

II
Like a rainbow it forms, it must be spring's doing.
The flower stamens are fragrant,
Drawing only honeybees.
My languid laziness,
I fear others might see.

III
In a single shower, the ditch water overflows,
The evening sun, the setting sun, hangs halfway on the branches.
How lovely, a pair of orioles sits chirping in the nest,
White fish in the pond
Kick up the water plants.

IV
The well water is cloudy,
Cover it with palm leaves (棕櫚葉).
Digging a ditch,
Cut the bamboo roots.
Floating a small boat,
Rowing it gently to and fro,
How amusing, the winding path
Leads to the village.

V
Fresh blue bamboo shoots pierce the earthen wall,
Winding wisteria vines wrap around the pavilion eaves.
In the sun-warmed, clear yard,
Wisteria tendrils sway like threads,
On the bank of the pale, ribbon-like white river,
Only the young blades of fine grass are soft.

VI
As the river water ripples,
The moonlight glimmers, shifting onto the rocks.
The stream seeming empty, <217>
White clouds drift billowingly
Beside the flowers.
Even flying birds, seeking their nests,
Find their old homes.
That returning boat,
At whose house will it stay?

Selections from Li Taibai (李太白抄)
Translated by Yi Pyŏng-gi (李秉岐譯)

Song of Zi Wu Ye (子吳夜歌 - likely 子夜吳歌 Ziye Wu Ge)

A slice of moon over Chang'an,
Ten thousand households pound laundry.
The autumn wind blows unendingly,
All is longing for Yu Guan (玉關).

What day will the Hu barbarians be quelled,
And my good man cease his distant campaigning?

Translation:

Under a slice of Chang'an moon,
Ten thousand sounds of laundry pounding.

The blowing autumn wind—
All is sorrow from Okkwan (玉關).

On what day will the barbarians (되놈) be defeated,
And my husband end his distant campaign?

Chang'an (長安) was the western capital of the Tang, now Xi'an (西安府) in Shaanxi Province (陝西省). <218>
Yu Guan (玉關) is the Jade Gate Pass, 3600 li north of Chang'an.

Song of Qiupu (秋浦吟 - 秋浦歌 Qiupu Ge)

I
Jiang Zu's (江祖) single slab of stone,
A painted screen swept against the blue sky.

Write a poem to leave for ten thousand ages,
Green words grow on brocade moss.

Translation:

A single piece of stone at Kangjo (江祖),
A painted screen wiped clean in the blue sky.

Let's write a poem to leave for ten thousand ages,
On the green letters, golden moss grows.

II
White hair three thousand zhang long,
Because of sorrow, it seems this long.

I do not know, in the bright mirror,
From where did I get this autumn frost?

Translation:

White hair three thousand lengths (길),
Due to sorrow, it is like this.

I do not know, in the bright mirror,
Where this autumn frost came from.

III
Thousands upon thousands of nanmu trees (石楠樹),
Myriads upon myriads of privet groves (女貞林).

Mountain after mountain full of white egrets,
Ravine after ravine, white apes cry. <219>

Sir, do not go towards Qiupu (秋浦),
The apes' cries shatter the traveler's heart.

Translation:

Thousand upon thousand nanmu (石楠) trees,
Myriad upon myriad privet (女貞) bushes.

Every mountain is full of egrets,
In every ravine, white apes (잣나븨 - likely 白猿) cry.

You, sir, do not go to Ch'up'o (秋浦),
The ape's (잣나븨) cry shatters the traveler's heart.

IV
Patrolmen cross the bird path,
From Jiang Zu (江祖) emerges the fish weir.

Water swift, boat travels fast,
Mountain flowers brush the face, fragrant.

Translation:

The patrolman (邏人) skirts the bird path (鳥道),
From Kangjo (江祖) comes out the fish weir (魚梁).

The water is swift, the boat is fast,
Mountain flowers (뫼ㅅ꽃) fall upon the face, fragrant.
(Patrolman (邏人) is a person from Luo (邏) land)

Holding Wine, Asking the Moon (把酒問月)

Blue sky holds the moon, since when did it come?
I now stop my cup and ask it this.
People climbing towards the bright moon cannot reach it,
Yet the moon travels along with people.
Bright like a flying mirror nearing the Cinnabar Palace (丹闕),
Green mist vanishes, clear brilliance emerges.
One only sees it come from the sea at night,
How could one know it sets among clouds at dawn? <220>
White rabbit pounds medicine, autumn then spring,
Chang'e (姮娥) lives alone, who is her neighbor?
People today do not see the ancient moon,
Yet today's moon once shone on ancient people.
Ancient people, people today, like flowing water,
All look at the bright moon just like this.
I only wish that when singing songs and facing wine,
The moonlight will forever shine into the golden goblet (金樽).

Translation:

How many times has that moon in the blue sky come?
I now stop my cup and ask.
Though people cannot reach for the moon,
The moon instead follows people.
Bright like a polished mirror, it reaches the Cinnabar Palace (丹闕),
The green mist (綠煙) vanishes, and clear light spreads.
One only sees it coming over the sea at night;
How would one know it sets among the dawn clouds?
Autumn then spring, the white rabbit pounds medicine,
Chang'e (姮娥) is lonely, who is there to be her neighbor?
People today have not seen the ancient moon,
Yet today's moon has shone upon ancient people.
Ancient people, people today, are like flowing water;
Looking at that moon, all are like this.
I only wish, when singing and facing wine,
That the moonlight will always shine into the golden goblet (金樽).

Cinnabar Palace (丹闕) is an immortal palace. The white rabbit is said to pound the elixir of life in the moon. Chang'e (姮娥) is a moon goddess (仙女).

On the Riverbank with a Cassia Mat, Waiting for the Moon, with Feelings (桂席江上 待月 有懷)

Waiting for the moon, the moon has not yet risen,
Gazing at the river, the river flows on its own.

Suddenly, by the western city wall, <221>
In the blue sky hangs a jade hook (玉鉤 - crescent moon).

Though its pure brilliance can be gathered,
Cannot roam together in the clear scene.

Brightly shimmering in the golden waves,
Gazing empty at the Ejak Tower (額鵲樓).

Translation:

Waiting, but the moon does not rise,
The river just flows by itself.

Suddenly, above the western city wall's blue void,
A jade hook (玉갈구려) hangs brightly.

Though its light might be gathered,
We cannot wander together.

In the sparkling water waves (물ᄉ결),
I just gaze up at the Ejak Tower (額鵲樓).

Crow Cawing at Night (烏夜啼)

Yellow clouds by the city wall, crows about to roost,
Returning, flying, cawing Caw-Caw, crying on the branches.
Weaving brocade on the loom, a woman of Qin Chuan (秦川),
Through blue gauze like smoke, speaks through the window.
Stopping the shuttle, sadly thinking of the distant person,
Sleeping alone in the empty room, tears like rain.

Translation:

By the yellow cloud city wall (黃雲 城ᄉ갓), the house crow (잘가마귀)
Flies in, cawing Caw-Caw.
The Qin Chuan (秦川) woman weaving silk
Speaks through the gauze window (紗窓).
Stopping the shuttle, longing for the one far away, <222>
She guards the empty room with tears.

Selections from Bai Letian's Poems (白樂天詩抄)
Translated by Kim Ŏk (金億譯)

Chang'an Road (長安道)

Where flower branches break, a blue tower (brothel) opens,
One love song, one cup of wine.

The beauty urges me to quickly enjoy pleasure,

Since ancient times, rosy cheeks never come again.
Don't you see, provincial officials on the Chang'an road,

Each time they come, they age each time.

Translation:

Where the flowering branches end, the courtesan house entrance (門깐).
With one love song, also one round of wine.

The young lady (閣氏) tells me to make merry, saying,

From old times, youth never comes twice.
The country guests visiting Seoul (서울 - here referring to Chang'an),

Each time they come, their faces grow thinner.

Secret Parting (潛別離)

Cannot cry,
Secret parting.
Cannot speak,
Hidden longing.
Beyond the two hearts, no one knows. <223>
A bird roosting alone, locked deep in a cage at night,
A sharp sword cutting linked branches in spring.

Though the Yellow River is muddy, there are clear days,
Though the crow's head is black, there are times it turns white.
Only for secret parting and hidden farewells,
Both sides resign themselves, with no future date set.

Translation:

Cannot even cry,
This deep parting.
Cannot even lament,
This deep longing.
Besides the two of us, who else could know?

If a bird, one locked alone in a cage (鳥籠);
If a tree, one cut down in springtime.
Though river water is murky, there are clear days,
Though the crow's black head has days it turns white,
In this sorrowful parting of deep longing,
There is always lament, but never a promise (期約).

Lotus Across the Inlet (隔浦蓮)

Across the inlet, love the red lotus,
Yesterday, saw it still there.
Night came, wind blew it down,
Only got to pick it once.

Though flowers bloom, there's the promise of next year,
But worry again that next year will also be brief.

Translation:

The red lotus flower (蓮꽃닢) blooming brightly across the inlet (浦口),
Yesterday its form was beautiful. <224>
Overnight wind and rain made it all fall,
This year, I couldn't see it but once.

Even if flowers bloom again next year,
Its life will be short, how pitiful (가이없고나).

Hansik Festival, Wild Vista at Dusk (寒食野望昑 - likely 寒食野望)

Ruins outside the Guo Gate (郭門),
Hansik, whose family cries?

Wind blows across the wide field, paper money flies,
Ancient tombs dot the land, green in the spring night.

Pear blossoms reflect on poplar trees,
All are places of life-and-death separation.

In the vast darkness of the deep springs, cries are not heard,
In the rustling evening rain, people return home.

Translation:

Outside the Seoul (서울) city gate, going to the rough field (거츤 뭐),
Hansik has come, someone cries sorrowfully.

Wind blows on the wide field, paper money (紙錢) flies,
On the high and low tombs, the grass color is blue.

On the willow (버드남겐 - likely 白楊樹 poplar), wild pear blossoms cluster,
Life and death mean separation for people.

In the dark Yellow Springs (黃泉), crying won't be heard,
Only the lonely evening rain dampens the clothes.

Taihang Road (太行路)

The Taihang Road can break carts, <225>
But compared to your heart (君心 - also written 人心 later), it's a level path.
The water of the Wu Gorges (巫峽) can capsize boats,
But compared to your heart, it's a calm stream.
Your heart is fickle, bitterly inconstant,
Favor breeds feathers, disfavor breeds sores.
Married to you for not yet five years,
How could I expect us, like the Cowherd and Weaver Girl, to become Orion and Lucifer (參商 - stars that never appear together)?
It's said of old, when beauty fades, one is abandoned,
Even then, the beauty still felt resentment and regret.
How much more so now, in the phoenix mirror (鸞鏡),
My face hasn't changed, but your heart has changed.
I perfume your clothes for you,
You smell the orchid and musk (蘭麝) but find no fragrance.
I adorn myself richly for you,
You look at the pearls and jade (珠翠) but see no beauty.
The road of life is hard,
Hard to state again.
In life, don't be born a woman,
A hundred years of sorrow and joy depend on others.
The road of life is hard,
Harder than mountains,
More perilous than water.
Not only between husband and wife in families,
Even between lord and minister in recent times, it is like this.
Don't you see,
The Zuo Na Yan (左納言 - Left Counselor),
The You Na Shi (右納史 - Right Historian?),
Received favor in the morning,
Was granted death in the evening.
The road of life is hard,
Not in the water,
Not in the mountains,
Only in the fickleness of human feelings. <226>

Translation:

Even if the T'aehaeng (太行) road breaks carts,
Compared to your heart, it's rather a level road (垣路),
Even if the Muhyŏp (巫峽) water capsizes passing boats,
Compared to your heart, it's rather a calm stream (安流).
How can I know your heart?
One moment you liked me, the next you dislike me.
If I please you, you smile brightly at once (今時에),
If I don't suit you, you just say you dislike me.

Calling each other husband and wife,
Living in one house, how many years has it been?
Counting on my fingers, it's not yet five years.
Old tales say, when age comes and the face withers,
Even if parted, others
Would lament that this parting is not right.

Wouldn't this body feel sorrow then?
My face reflected in the mirror,
Still beautiful as before, but my beloved,
Why has your heart changed to dislike me?

When I perfume clothes for you,
You complain that even good scents (香水) are not good,
When I dress up with all kinds of adornments for you,
You reprimand me, saying even jewels (구슬) are not good.
This difficult world,
What more can I lament again?
In this life, no one should be born a woman,
A hundred years of sorrow and joy are all someone else's fault (남 탔이라고).

How hard it is to live through this world,
Could mountains or water be harder than this?
Is it only like this for husband and wife in a house?
Even between king and subject, it's all the same. (Remainder omitted 下畧)

All the above pieces are from "Selections of Famous Chinese Poems" (支那名詩選) published by this company (本社發行). <227>

**Summary**

This article presents Korean translations of famous classical Chinese poems from the *Shijing* (Book of Songs), Du Fu, Li Bai, and Bai Juyi, done by prominent Korean literary figures of the time: Yang Chu-dong, Pak Chong-hwa, Yi Pyŏng-gi, and Kim Ŏk. Each section includes a brief introduction to the source text or poet, followed by the translated poems. The translations render the classical Chinese verses into Korean, often using contemporary (1940) vernacular and older orthography. The selections focus heavily on themes of nature, longing, love, sorrow, the passage of time, and social commentary, particularly the fickleness of human relationships in Bai Juyi's "Taihang Road."

From a historical perspective, the article is interesting as it showcases the continued engagement of Korean intellectuals with the classical Chinese literary tradition during the Japanese colonial period. The act of translating these works into Korean, using Korean scholars and published in a Korean magazine (albeit one potentially under Japanese surveillance), can be seen as an assertion of Korean cultural identity and literary activity. The choice of poems, particularly those expressing sorrow, longing for return, criticism of fickle power (Bai Juyi), might subtly resonate with the contemporary situation of Korea under colonial rule, although this is not explicitly stated. The translators themselves were significant figures in Korean literature and scholarship.

支那詩聖의 名詩集
						梁柱東 외
詩傳抄
梁柱東譯
詩經은 周初로부터 列國時代에 이르기까지 우으론 朝廷과 宗廟에 쓰는 樂章으로부터 밑으론 民間閭巷에서 부르는 歌謠 무릇 300有餘首를 採錄한 것이니, 실로 中國文學의 淵源을 이루는 최고의 시집으로서 원래 孔子의 所編이라 이른다.
子夏의 毛詩序에 의하면 詩에는 由來 6義가 있으니, 곧 風·賦·比·興·雅·頌이 그것이다. 그러나 이 중의 「興·賦·比」 三者는 詩法이오, 「風·雅·頌」 三者가 詩體이다. 「風」이란 이른바 里巷의 가요로서 흔히 남녀간의 情歌가 많은데, 周召 二南은 「樂而不淫, 哀而不傷」(孔子)으로 正風이라 이르며, 邶以下는 모다 變風인 바 鄭, 衛의 소리가 그 중에도 淫亂이 많다 하야 儒者派가 이를 擯斥하여 왔으나 민요의 素朴味, 率直性으론 도로혀 可愛한 점이 많다. 「雅」와 「頌」은 모다 朝廷과 郊廟의 樂歌인데 雅의 原義는 「正」으로서 政에 대소가 있으므로 小雅,＜210＞ 大雅의 別이 있다하미(子夏序), 또 變風과 같이 變雅도 있다.
譯은 처음 各體를 골고로 取하고저 하였으나, 자연 민요체인 「風」이 대부분을 占하게 되였다. 雅頌은 由來 拮据莊重하매 譯하기도 어렵거니와 譯出한대야 일반 독자에게는 자못 무미건조하겠기 때문이다.

증겹이
물ㅅ가에 증경이는
암수 서로 우니나다.
아릿다운 아가씨는
님의 좋은 짝이로다.

올망 졸망 마름닢을
이리 저리 거리놋다.
아릿다운 아가씨를
자나깨나 얻니놋다.
얻니어도 얻지못해
자나깨나 생각노니,
시름은 그지 없어,
뒤척뒤척 하도소라.

올망졸망 마룸닢을
이리 저리 캐리로다.
아릿다운 아가씨를
琴瑟로써 벋하과저.
올망졸망 마름닢을
이리 저리 익히리라,
아릿다운 아가씨를
북치면서 즐기과저.

關關雎鳩, 在河之洲. 窈窕淑女, 君子好述.＜211＞

忡忡. 亦旣見止, 亦旣覯止, 我心則降

陟彼南山, 言采其蕨. 未見君子, 憂心惙惙. 亦旣見止, 亦旣覯止, 我心則說

陟彼南山, 言采其薇. 未見君子, 我心傷悲. 亦旣見止, 亦旣覯止, 我心則夷

五言絶句

絶句二首
遲日江山麗
春風花草香
泥融飛燕子
沙暖睡鴛鴦

江碧鳥逾白
山靑花欲燃
今春看又過
何日是歸年

폭은한 봄날시에 흰날은 길다.
산뜻한 물과 산, 그린 듯이 더욱 곱고
한들한들 봄바람에 꽃과 풀 향기롭네.
녹으라진 진흙밭엔 나는 제비 재절대고
모래알 따수하니, 鴛鴦 한쌍은 의좋게 존다.

새파란 강물엔＜214＞
물새빛 더옥 히고
우줄우줄 山푸르니 진달네는 타는듯하이
이 한봄 시름없이 또 흘려보내나
어느 날이나 돌아 간다늬.

歸鴈
春來萬里客
亂定幾年歸
腸斷江城鴈
高高向北飛

봄은 또 왔건만
萬里박 손은
어느 때나 난리끝나 돌아 갈꺼냐
기럭이 외기럭이
울부짖는 외기럭이
우줄 우줄 北편으로 날어가는 외기럭이
구슲어라 애끈여라 마음 앞으다.

絶句
江邊踏靑罷
迴首見旌旗
風起春城暮
高樓鼓角悲

푸른풀 江邊에 밟어
踏靑놀이 돌아오다.
고개돌녀 선뜻보니 군사의 깃발
점으른 봄城엔 바람만이 드높구야
오오, 구슲어라 처량한 나팔소리.

絶句六首＜215＞

日出籬東水
雲生舍北泥
竹高鳴翡翠
沙僻舞鵾鷄

靄靄花蘂亂
飛飛蜂蝶多
幽樓身懶動
客至欲何如

急雨梢溪足
斜暉轉樹腰
隔巢黃鳥竝
飜藻白魚跳

鑿井交*葉
開渠斷竹根
扁舟輕裊纜
小逕曲通村

舍下笋穿壁
亭前藤刺簷
地晴絲冉冉
江白草纖纖

江動月移石
溪虛雲傍花
鳥棲知故道
帆過宿誰家

붉으레 둥근 해 울넘어 뜨고
피여오르는 흰구름 언덕에 이네
파득파득 우는 대ㅅ닢, 翠翡같구나
한가한 모래 틈엔＜216＞
물새만 운다.

도지개만 틀니네, 봄 탔이로다
꽃술은 향기러워
꿀벌만 불으니
나렸한 내 게으름
남이 볼까 두렵네.

소낙비 한줄기에, 또랑물 벅차고
夕陽, 지는 해는 반넘어 가지어 걸리다.
어엽부다, 한 쌍 꾀꼬리 보금이에 앉어 또얏거리고
힌고기, 연못속에
마름풀을 박찬다.

우물 물 흐리니
棕櫚잎 덮고
개천을 파서
대뿌리 잘은다.
조고만 배 띄워
흔들 한들 저어니
재미롭다, 구븐 길은
마실 이로세.

새파란 대ㅅ순, 土壁을 뚤코
구불구불 등나무 亭子추녀 휘감었네
볕살 포근이 개인 마당엔
藤넌출 실실이 너울거리고
희멀금 띠 같은 힌 江 언덕엔
새 속닢 잔듸풀만 연연하구나.

강물이 출렁대니
달빛, 아룽아룽 돌로 왼기고
시내물 비인 양해＜217＞
흰구름 몽실몽실
꽃 곁에 일다.
나는 새 집으러도
옛집을 찾는다,
돌아오는 저 배야
뉘게서 묵나.

李太白抄
李秉岐譯

子吳夜歌
長安一片月
萬戶擣衣聲
秋風吹不盡
總是玉關情

何日平胡虜
良人罷遠征

한쪽 長安 달에
만가락 다드미 소리.

불어오는 가을 바람
다 玉關의 시름이거니

어느 날 되놈을 다 치고
郞君이 遠征을 파하리.

長安은 唐의 西都, 지금 陝西省 西安府.＜218＞
玉關은 長安北 3600里에 있는 玉關.

秋浦吟
江祖一片石
靑天掃畵屛

題詩留萬古
綠字錦苔生

江祖의 한 쪼각돌
靑天에 쓸은 畵屛

詩를 써 萬古에 두자니
평런 글자에 金苔가 난다

白髮三千丈
緣愁似箇長

不知明鏡裏
何處得秋霜

白髮이 三千길
시름으로 이러하다

모르겠다 明鏡 속에
어드런게 가을 서린가

千千石楠樹
萬萬女貞林

山山白鷺滿
澗澗白猿吟＜219＞

君莫向秋浦
猿聲碎客心

千千 石楠나무
萬萬 女貞떨기

山마다 해오리 차고
간수마다 잣나븨 우니

그대 秋浦를 가지마소
잣나븨 소리 객의 맘을 바수네

邏人橫鳥道
江祖出魚梁

水急舟行疾
由花棉面香

邏人이 鳥道를 비껴
江祖로 魚梁을 나오네

물은 급하고 배는 빠르고
뫼ㅅ꽃은 낯에 떨쳐 향긔롭네
(邏人은 邏 땅에 사람)

把酒問月



靑天有月來幾時
我今停盃一問之
人攀明月不可得
月行却與人相隨
皎如飛鏡臨丹闕
綠煙滅盡淸輝發
但見宵從海上來
寧知曉向雲閒沒＜220＞
白兎搗藥秋復春
姮娥孤樞與誰鄰
今人不見古時月
今月曾經照古人
古人今人若流水
共看明月皆如此
惟願當歌對酒時
月光長照金樽裏

靑天에 저 달이 몇 번이나 온고
내, 이제 잔을 멈추고 묻노라.
사람은 달을 더위잡을 수 없지마는
달은 도려 사람과 서로 따르도다.
닷봇근 거울처럼 밝어 丹闕에 다다르고
綠煙은 슬어지고 맑은빛 퍼지어라.
밤이면 바다 우로 옴을 볼뿐이오
새벽 구름 틈으로 지는 줄 어이 알리.
가을 또 봄, 힌토끼 藥을 찧고
姮娥는 외로 이웃할 이 뉘 있으리.
지금사람은 옛 달을 못보았으되
지금 달은 옛사람을 비쳐왔도다.
옛사람 지금사람 흐르는 물과 같어
저 달은 봄이 다 이러하리.
다만 원컨대 노래하고 술 대할 때
달빛은 항상 金樽에 비쳐다오.

丹闕은 仙宮. 힌 토끼는 달 가운대에 었이 藥방아를 찧는다 함. 姮娥는 仙女.

桂席江上 待月 有懷
待月月未出
望江江自流

悠忽城西郭＜221＞
靑天懸玉鉤

素華雖可攬
淸景不同遊

耿耿金波裏
空瞻額鵲樓

기다려도 달은 아니 나고
江만 절로 흐르더니,

서편 성머리 푸른 허공에
玉갈구려 산듯 걸려

그 빛은 비록 거둘망정
함께 노들 못하여라.

반자기는 물ᄉ결 속에
額鵲樓만 처다 본다.

烏夜啼
黃雲城邊烏欲棲
歸飛啞啞枝上啼
機上織錦秦川女
碧紗如煙隔窓語
亭梭悵然憶遠人
獨宿空房淚如雨

黃雲 城ᄉ갓 잘가마귀
날어들어 깍깍 운다.
비단 짜는 秦川 여자
紗窓 격하여 말을 하다.
북을 멈춰 외오 그리고＜222＞
눈물로 빈방만 지키는고야.

白樂天詩抄
金億譯

長安道
花枝缺處靑樓開
염歌一曲酒一盃

美人勸我急行樂

自古朱顔不再來
君不見外州官客長安道

一廻來時一廻老

꽃가진 다라졌네, 갈보집 門깐.
사랑노래 한번에 술도 한 순배.

절므 閣氏 나다려 놀라하면서,

예부터 두 번 다시 못오는 청춘,
서울출입 하시는 싀골손님들

올때마다 얼골은 예위드라고.

潛別離
不得哭
潛別離
不得語
暗相思
兩心之外無人知＜223＞
深籠夜鏁獨棲鳥
利劍春斷連理枝

河水雖濁有淸日
烏頭雖黑有白時
唯有潛離與暗別
彼此甘心無後期

울길이나
그윽한 離別,
하소나마
그윽한 相思
둘밖에야 그 뉘가 다시러 알랴.

새라면 딴혼자로 鳥籠든거요
나무라면 봄철에 찍킨심이라.
강물은 흐렸다도 맑은 날 있고
가마귀 검은머리 흴 날 있서도
그윽한 이 相思의 설은 離別엔
언제나 하소연만 期約은 없네.

隔浦蓮
隔浦愛紅蓮
昨日看猶在
夜來風吹落
只得一回採

花開雖有明年期
復愁明年還暫時

浦口건너 발핫케 피인 蓮꽃닢
어젯날 그 모양이 아름답드니＜224＞
밤사이 바람 비에 모다 졌고나
今年엔 한 차레 뿐 내 못봣노라.

明年이라 또다시 꽃핀다해도
그 목슴 짤브리니 가이없고나.

寒食野望昑
丘墟郭門外
寒食誰家哭

風吹曠野紙錢飛
古墓纍纍春夜綠

棠梨花映白楊樹
盡是死生離別處

冥漠重泉哭不聞
蕭蕭暮雨人歸去

서울이라 城門밖 거츤 뭐 가서
寒食왔다 누군지 서러이 우네.

넓은들 바람불어 紙錢이 날고
놉고 낮은 무덤엔 풀빚 파랐타.

버드남겐 돌배꽃 머리여서도
죽고 살고 사람은 離別이고야.

어득한 黃泉서야 운들 알거랴
져녁비만 쓸쓸이 옷을 적시네.

太行路
太行之路能摧車＜225＞
若比君心一作人心下同
是坦途
巫峽之水能覆舟
若比君心是安流
君心是惡苦不常
好生毛羽惡生瘡
與君結髮未五載
豈期牛女爲參商
古稱色衰相棄背
當時美人猶怨悔
何况如今鸞鏡中
妾顔未改君心改
爲君薰衣裳
君聞蘭麝不馨香
爲君盛容飾
君看珠翠無顔色
行路難
難重陳
人生莫作婦人身
百年苦樂由他人
行路難
難於山
險於水
不獨人家夫與妻
近代君臣亦如此
君不見
左納言
右納史
朝承恩
暮賜死
行路難
不在水
不在山
只在人情反覆間＜226＞

太行길이 수레를 꺽는다 해도
님의 맘에 比기면 오이려 垣路,
巫峽물 지내는 배 덥는다 해도
님의 맘에 比기면 도로혀 安流.
님의 맘야 알 길이 어이 있으랴,
언제는 조왔다가 다시 실타면
맘에 들면 今時에 조와라 웃고
안마즈면 그대로 실타는고야.

지아비라 안해라 서로 불으며
한집에서 지낸 지 몇 해란 말가,
손곱으니 아직도 五年 못되네.
옛말에 나이 늙고 얼골이 에워
離別을 한다해도 아무네들은
이離別은 아니라 원망한다고.

그런 것은 이 몸야 그 안설으랴,
거울 속에 빛최는 나의 이 얼골
예대로 엽본 것은 나의 그대는
어이해 맘이變해 실타하는고.

님을 위해 옷에다 香水뿌리면
좋은香도 아니라 말성 부리고,
가즌 단장 님 위해 차리고 나면
구슬도 아니라고 책망이고야.
어려운 이 한世上
두 번 다시 무어라 탄식할거랴.
이人生 아무네도 안태일 것이
百年苦樂 모두다 남 탔이라고.

한世上 지내가기 이닷 어련가,
山이나 물이런들 예서 더하랴.
한집이라 內外만 그럴 것이랴
임금이랴 臣下도 모다 같거니,(下畧)
