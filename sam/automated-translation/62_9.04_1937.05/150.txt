Article Title: 開心寺를 차저 (Visiting Kaesimsa Temple)
Author: 權培根
Article Type: 시 (Poem)

Though I pass and pass again along the winding, twisting road,
There's still no sign of Kaesimsa Temple (開心寺), its trace yet unseen.
Perhaps Kaesimsa is Murŭngdowŏn (무릉도원), I wonder.

Is this a gentle, clear breeze sent by someone?
How pleasant! A pure fragrance is carried on the wind.
Strange bird songs also come intermittently.

Amidst yellow leaves and red leaves, green pines here and there;
White clouds play on secluded rocks (幽石), and a fragrant wind (香風) blows on the grassy path.
It thoroughly washes the soul that was buried in worldly dust (俗塵).

Why gaze around so much when the road ahead is busy?
Is it only the path ahead that's urgent? The stone path (石逕) is also treacherous.
The place is lovely, the scenery grand—what am I to do? <20>

**Summary**

This poem by Kwŏn Paegŭn describes the poet's journey to Kaesimsa Temple. The path is long and winding, leading the poet to compare the hidden temple to the mythical paradise of Murŭngdowŏn. Along the way, the poet appreciates the refreshing breeze, fragrant air, bird songs, colourful foliage, and serene natural elements, feeling purified from worldly concerns. The poem concludes with the poet torn between the need to hurry along the difficult path and the desire to linger in the beautiful scenery. For historians, the poem offers a glimpse into the appreciation of traditional Korean Buddhist sites and natural beauty as a form of escapism or cultural affirmation during the colonial period. It reflects a personal, aesthetic response to the landscape, potentially contrasting with the era's political realities.

開心寺를 차저
						權培根
이리저리 구비진 길 지나고 또 지나도
나타날 뜻 開心寺 자최 아직 묘연한 걸
아마도 무릉도원이 開心寺-가 하노라

누기가 보내시는 가벼운 청풍인고
조흘 손 맑은 향기 바람에 실렷고야
이상한 새 소리도 드믄드믄 오누나

누렁닙 빨강닙 사이사이 푸른 솔
幽石엔 힌 구름 놀고 풀길에- 香風이라
俗塵에 뭇첫든 넋을 고히 씨서 주누나

웬 눈을 그리 파노 갈 길이 밧부거니
갈 길만 급할 뿐가 石逕도 위태하다
곳 좋고 景色 조흐니 이를 어이 하겠노 <20>
