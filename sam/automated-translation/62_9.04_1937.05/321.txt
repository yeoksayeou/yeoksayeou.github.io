The Inevitability of War

The Inevitability of War and National Defense

Since war determines the life and death of the people and the survival or ruin of the state, civilized nations, both past and present, strive through diplomatic efforts to promote international friendship and prevent disputes that arise from time to time, aiming to resolve them peacefully.
However, each nation has specific interests aimed at promoting its national benefit and the people's welfare. These interests often not only fail to align with those of other nations but sometimes run completely counter to them, leading to conflicts of interest. Furthermore, when each country insists on its own claims and refuses to compromise, diplomatic means become inadequate, and military force is employed as a last resort. Therefore, it is natural for nations seeking independence and prosperity to spare no effort in fully equipping their national defense power, which guarantees and propels the nation's existence and activities. Especially in an era like the recent past, where international confrontations are intensifying, we believe it is necessary for Our Country (我國) to prepare its national defense to protect our nation from foreign invasion and attack and to eliminate various obstacles to the execution of national policy.
Fundamentally, national defense is based on national power, encompassing military preparedness, economy, ideology, and other tangible and intangible elements. Therefore, for national defense, while striving for the enhancement of national power in both material and spiritual aspects, it is also crucial to fully prepare for operations with a defense objective. The best strategy is to achieve objectives without fighting, but in unavoidable circumstances, all national institutions must inevitably engage in war comprehensively. The enhancement of national defense cannot be neglected even for a day. At the same time, each nation's military strength level, organization, equipment, principles of strategy, etc., are primarily determined by the demands of its national defense.

Each Nation's National Position and its Relationship to Army Armaments

Every nation, without exception, has its own unique national principles and policies. Also, due to the configuration of its territory, the defense thereof presents varying degrees of difficulty, and the state of its finances, economy, resources, etc., significantly impacts the maintenance and management of its military forces. Therefore, in determining military strength levels and other factors, while each nation's independent variables play a crucial role, the situations of related powers act as relative factors, exerting subtle influences. Consequently, each nation strives to maintain its own unique military preparedness adapted to its position and environment.<46>
For example, the Soviet Union, aspiring to communize the world and viewing all capitalist nations as enemies, considers the strengthening of the Red Army—the so-called "World Revolutionary Armed Detachment"—as the foremost national policy, thus carrying out large-scale military expansion even at the expense of the people's livelihood.
Poland, too, situated among the European powers and constantly under threat from other countries, possesses strong military preparedness.
France, needing to confront its neighbor Germany, requires the swiftest possible execution of operations. Thus, in peacetime, it maintains elite and strong standing forces and has perfected facilities for rapid mobilization.
Britain, due to its fundamental geographical situation and superior naval power, was content with a small-scale army. However, stimulated by recent changes in the international situation and the bitter experiences of the World War, it is striving for a major expansion of its air force and the mechanization and readiness of its army, aiming for active mobile warfare on the European continent. On the other hand, a country like the United States is entirely different from the nations mentioned above. Lacking powerful neighbors nearby and, moreover, possessing the resources and industrial capacity to rapidly prepare large quantities of military supplies in case of emergency, it enjoys favorable conditions for national defense. Therefore, in peacetime, it maintains a relatively small army but seeks hegemony in naval power globally. Also, Germany, before its declaration of rearmament made with tragic resolve, quietly prepared the necessary armaments, using them as silent support for its propaganda efforts. These all exemplify military preparedness adapted to the respective positions and environments of the aforementioned countries.

Our Country's National Defense Position and Environment

What is Our Country's (我國) national defense position and environment among the world powers? First, looking at the state of Our Country's territorial configuration, Our Country's main territory consists of long, extended islands where troop movement is inconvenient, and its territory is connected to the continent. Furthermore, having concluded a mutual defense pact with Manchukuo (滿洲國), the defense requires not only addressing the extension of the territory and national border, with no specific points demanding defense concentration [implying a broad front], but also necessitates a powerful military force. Moreover, considering the state of finances and industrial capacity, rapidly organizing a large army in wartime is extremely difficult, and protracted warfare is not desirable. Thus, it is necessary to maintain an elite standing army sufficient to bring wars to a swift conclusion.
The conditions in neighboring countries, let alone foreign nations with deep-seated interests even if they do not share a border, greatly influence a nation's military preparedness, especially their policies and armaments. For example, if a neighboring country's military strength is weak, there is less concern that it will inflict harm upon Our Country, and consequently, Our Country's military force need not be exceedingly strong. However, if a neighboring country adopts an aggressive policy and possesses powerful armaments, it becomes necessary to overcome all difficulties (萬難) and maintain a standing force capable of matching it. From this viewpoint, observing the surrounding situation encompassing Our Country, the current trends of the major powers can generally be assessed as follows (Continued)<47>

**Summary**

This 1937 article by the Japanese Army Ministry Press Section, published in Korean for a Korean audience, argues that war is inevitable due to conflicting national interests. It asserts the necessity for nations, including Japan ("Our Country"), to maintain strong national defenses tailored to their specific geopolitical circumstances. The article surveys the military postures of major powers (Soviet Union, Poland, France, Britain, USA, Germany) as examples of this adaptation. It then specifically discusses Japan's situation—an island nation connected to the continent via Manchukuo—arguing this necessitates a powerful, elite standing army capable of swift victory, rather than protracted warfare, due to limitations in rapid large-scale mobilization and industrial capacity. Historically, this article is significant as it represents direct Japanese militarist propaganda disseminated in Korea during the colonial period. It justifies Japan's military buildup and aggressive foreign policy using geopolitical rationale, framing Japan's needs within a global context of inevitable conflict and portraying its actions as necessary for national survival and interest, implicitly including Korea within that "national" scope under Japanese rule. Historians would find it valuable for understanding the ideological justifications presented by the Japanese military to its colonial subjects on the eve of the Second Sino-Japanese War's full escalation.

戰爭의 不可避性과 國防

戰爭은 國民의 死活問題와 國家의 存亡을 決斷하는 것이니 만치 過去나 現在를 勿論하고 文明諸國은 外交工作으로 國際間의 和親을 圖謀하고 時時刻刻으로 惹起되는 紛議를 未然에 防止하여 平和裡에 解決하도록 努力하는것이다
그렇나 各國家는 그나라의 國利民福을 增進식히기위한 特殊한 利害關係를 가지고있다. 이러한 關係는 往往히 他國의 利害와 一致되지안을뿐外라 全然背馳되는 일도 있는데서 利害衝突이니러나고또 各國이 各各自國의 主張을 固執하여 서로 讓步가없는때는 外交手段으로 處理하지못하고 最後手段으로 武力을 쓰게되는것이다. 라서 獨立과 隆盛을 希求하는 國家는 國家존립活動의 保障이며 推進力인 國防力의 充備에 大努力을 앗기지안음도 當然한일이다. 我國에있어도 特히 最近과 같이 國際的 對立이 激化하는 時代에 있어서는 外敵의 侵入竝攻擊에 對하여 我國家를 防衛하고 國策遂行에 對한 各種의 妨害를 排除하기爲한 國防을 備하는것이 必要한줄안다.
元來 國防은 軍備, 經濟, 思想, 其他有形無形의 要素를 網羅한 國力에 立脚하는것이니만치 國防을 爲하여는 物心兩面으로 國力의 充實을 圖謀함과 同時에 國防目的으로 作戰準備를 充實히하여 싸홈치안코도 目的을 達成하는것이 上策이나 不得已한 境遇에는 國家의 各機構가 全般的으로 戰爭에 當하지안을수없을것이며 國防의 充實은 一日이라도 不可缺할 것인 同時 各國의 兵力量, 編制, 裝備, 用兵의 要領 等은 주로 各國의 國防上의 要求에 依하야 決定되는것이다.

各國의 國家的 立場과 陸軍軍備의 關係

何國을 莫論하고 獨自의 國是國策이있다 또 國土構成狀態로 因하야 그 防衛에 難易가 있고 그나라의 財政, 經濟, 資源 等의 狀態로 兵力의 維持, 管理에 큰 關係가 생기는것이다. 그럼으로 各國이 다 兵力量 其他의 決定에 있어서는 各國의 自主的 諸元이 中隊한 役割을 演出함은 勿論, 關係列國의 情勢는 相對的 要素로서 微妙한 交感을 주는것이니만치 各國은 各各 그 立場과 環境에 適應하겠금 獨自의 軍備를 保有하기에 努力하는것이다.＜46＞
例를들면 蘇聯邦은 世界共産化를理想하고 全世界資本主義國家를 敵으로 하느니만치 所謂『世界革命武裝支隊』인 赤軍增强을 國策의第一義로함으로 國民生活을 犧牲식히면서라도 軍備大擴張을斷行하고있는것이다.
波蘭도 亦歐洲列强内에 介在하여 恒常他國의 威脅을밧고있음으로 强大한 軍備를가지고있다.
佛國은 接壤國인獨逸에 相對하기爲하야 가장迅速한作戰遂行을 必要로함으로 平時에는 精銳强下한 常備軍을가지고 短期間에 動員하기爲한 施設을完備하고있다.
英國은 根本地理的關係와優勢한海軍力關係로 陸軍은 小規模로滿足하엿스나 最近의國際情勢變化와 世界大戰의 쓰라린經驗에 剌戟되여 空軍의大擴張과 歐洲大陸에있어서 活潑한 運動戰을 目標로한 陸軍의機械化整備에 努力하고 있다. 一方米國같은나라는 以上과같은나라들과는 全然달나서 近隣에붓흔强國이없고 더욱一旦有事時에는 短期間에多量의軍用資材를整備할만한資源과 工業力이있는等 國防上의好條件을 具備하고 있음으로 平時는 比較的小數의陸軍을 保有하고있으나 海上兵力에있어서는 世界에서 覇權을 잡으려하고있는것이다. 그리고獨逸이 悲壯한 覺悟로 再軍備宣言을하기前에 가많이所要의軍備를 整備하여 宣傳遂行의無言의支持力으로한것等 다前記各國의 立場과環境에適應한軍備를말하는것이다.

我國의國防의立場과環境

世界列强가운대있어 我國의局防上의立場과 環境은 엇더한가하는것인대 爲先 我國의國土構成狀態로 보면 我國은 兵力移動이 不便한 長延한 島嶼를 本國으로하고 그領土는 大陸에接續하엿스며 滿洲國과는 共同防衛契約을 締結한故로 國土及國境의 延長大 따라防衛를 要하는 地點이없고 强大한 兵力을 必要한다 뿐만아니라 財政及工業力의關係로볼지라도 戰時의 急速히大軍을編成함은 大端困難할뿐만아니라 長期持久的作戰을要望하는바아니니 戰爭의終結을 速하게함에充足한 精銳한 常備軍을 必要하는것이다.
相接한 隣邦은勿論이고 國境이相接하지안흔나라이라할지라도 利害關係가깁흔外國의狀態는 더구나 그政策 特히軍備는 一國의軍備에 크나큰關係를 갓고있다 例를들면 隣邦이 萬若兵力이 微弱하면 我國에 危害를 깃칠 念慮가적으니 따라我國兵力도 그리强大함을 必要치안는다 然이나 隣邦이 侵略的政策을가지고 强大한軍備를 擁할時난 萬難을 背馳하고 이에對應할만한 兵力을 常備할必要가있다 이렇한見地로 我國을 싸고있는 四圍의情勢를볼際現在主要諸國의動向은 大體로 如次히 判斷할 수 있다(續)＜47＞
