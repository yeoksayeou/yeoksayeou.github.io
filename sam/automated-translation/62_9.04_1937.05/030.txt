Author: 파인 (P'ain)
Article Type: 시 (Poem)

The fire pouring onto the silver candlestick (銀燭台)
Burned deeply until it extinguished,
When lit and burning, it also burned deeply,
And extinguishes by itself, ah, unable to wait any longer...

They said a guest would come at the sound of the midnight bell (夜半鍾聲),
But at every midnight bell toll, my person goes, goes away.
Tonight there are not even fireflies,
So what matter if you stay until the Three Stars (三太星) rise?

The saying that there is surely a place where milk (젓) and honey flow,
Was it a mistake to have lived believing it?
While you are in the same city (城中), only I
Grow old in longing affection—what a waste!

A scholar who has lost purpose, a scholar who has lost purpose,
With no place to sit, no place to stand,
Throw yourself into the field of grass.
The sky is high, but my purpose alone knows not how to rise.<6>

**Summary**

This four-stanza poem by P'ain expresses deep feelings of sorrow, unfulfilled waiting, and disillusionment. The speaker laments a love or hope that fades like a candle, departs with the midnight bell, and proves as elusive as a promised land. The final stanza depicts a scholar bereft of purpose, unable to find his place or elevate his aspirations despite the vastness of the sky, culminating in a sense of resignation and despair. From a historical perspective, the poem's themes of longing, disappointment, and lost purpose could reflect the broader sense of hopelessness and suppressed aspirations felt by intellectuals and the Korean populace under Japanese colonial rule in the late 1930s. The scholar unable to find a place or rise might symbolize the constrained intellectual and social environment of the time.

淸怨四章
						파인
銀燭台에 붓는 불은
컬 때까지 깁부드니
켜서 타올때도 깁부드니
저절로 지는고야, 기다리다 못해...

夜半鍾聲에 손님이 온다더니
야반종성마다 내 사람은 가네, 가네
오늘밤은 반디불도 없거니
三太星 솟슬 때까지 게시온들 엇더리

젓과 꿀이 흐르는 곳, 분명 있다는 말
믿어서 사라온 것 잘못이든가.
가튼 城中 게시면서 나 혼자만
그리운 정에 늙어가기 앗갑구나

뜻일흔 선비, 뜻 일흔 선비
안즐 자리 설 자리 없서
풀밧헤 몸 던저라
하늘은 놉흔데, 내 뜻만 뜰 줄 모름을<6>
