A recent surprising event is the exposure of the Chungang Ilbo's 80,000 Won incident by the judicial authorities. Ultimately, although the person responsible for this incident is not under arrest, the case file has been transferred to the Prosecutor's Office (檢事局), and he is currently undergoing investigation by the prosecutor.

The investigation initially began under the direction of the Prosecutor's Office at the Judicial Section of the Jongno Police Station (鍾路警察署司法係) around mid-March. The executive-level individuals summoned at that time were Messrs. Yŏ Unhyŏng (呂運亨), Yun Hŭijung (尹希重), Sŏng Hŏn'gyŏng (成憲慶), Ch'oe Sŏnik (崔善益), and several others. In the end, it is said that only Sŏng Hŏn'gyŏng and a few others were sent to the Prosecutor's Office.

To report the details, when the newspaper was struggling with financial difficulties before its suspension, Mr. Sŏng Hŏn'gyŏng, a relative of Managing Director Mr. Yun Hŭijung and the Managing Director of Tongil Bank (東一銀行), came in bearing a large sum of 200,000 Won. Adding this to the previous 300,000 Won, the newspaper, now with its capital fully paid up at 500,000 Won, expanded its pages, enlarged its building, and greatly boosted its momentum. However, shortly thereafter, it was forced into voluntary suspension due to the National Flag Erasure Incident, bringing the company's finances to the brink of collapse. In an attempt to resolve the situation by scraping together all available funds, it was revealed that the 200,000 Won invested by Sŏng's side actually consisted of 120,000 Won in cash investment and 80,000 Won borrowed from the Namdaemun Branch of Tongil Bank using a promissory note (手形). Subsequently, after undergoing various complicated procedures, it was discovered that this promissory note had ultimately not been deposited into the company's accounts.

Consequently, there were many rumors circulating externally, suggesting this constituted fraud or breach of trust. In any case, at an executive meeting several days ago, Messrs. Sŏng and Yun reportedly declared they would produce the 80,000 Won in cash and deliver it to the company by September 20th. With this, since there will now be funds of 80,000 Won, it is said that if only the authorities grant permission, the newspaper will be able to resume publication soon. <34>

**Summary**

This 1937 news brief reports on a financial scandal at the Chungang Ilbo newspaper. An investigation revealed that a supposed 200,000 Won investment by Sŏng Hŏn'gyŏng, Managing Director of Tongil Bank and relative of Chungang Ilbo's Managing Director Yun Hŭijung, actually included an 80,000 Won promissory note that was never paid into the company accounts. This discovery occurred after the newspaper suspended publication due to the "National Flag Erasure Incident." Sŏng and Yun have now promised to pay the missing 80,000 Won by September 20th, raising hopes the paper might soon resume publication with official approval. For historians, this article offers insight into the financial struggles and internal issues of a major Korean newspaper under Japanese rule, linking financial impropriety with the political pressures leading to its suspension (the Flag Erasure Incident). It also names key figures involved in media and finance during this period.

八萬圓을내노키로 秋雲을편中中日報
最近에 놀래인 事實은 司法當局의 손에 依하여 中央日報의 八萬圓事件이 摘發되여 結局 이 事件責任者가 비록 不拘束이지만 一件書類와함게 檢事局에 넘어가서 方今檢事의 손에 取調를 밧고있는 것이다
이 事件이 처음 檢事局의 指揮에 依하야 鍾路警察署司法係에서 取調를 開始하기는 三月中旬頃으로서 그때 召喚된 幹部級人物은
呂運亨, 尹希重, 成憲慶, 崔善益 外數人의 諸氏엿는데 結局 檢事局에는 成憲慶外數人만 送局된셰음이라한다
이제 그 內容을 詳報하건대 休刊前에 財政難에허득일때에 專務尹希重氏의 親戚이요, 東一銀行專務로 있는 成憲慶氏가 二十萬圓의 大金을 짊어지고 드러왓다. 그래서 從來의 三十萬圓에 合하야 五十萬圓 全額拂込한 新聞社로서 增頁斷行, 社屋增築等, 그 氣勢가 크게 치었다. 그리다가 未久에 國旗抹殺事件으로 自進休刊의 不得已에 至하자, 全面的으로 社의 金庫는 破綻의 危機에 이르게되였다 그래서 있는 돈을다 떠러 局面을 收拾하려고보니 結局 成民側出資二十萬圓이란, 十二萬圓의 現今出資에다가 八萬圓은 水形으로 東一銀行南大門支店에서 借金한 것이 알려젓고, 그뒤 그 手形은 여러 가지 複雜한 手續을거처 結局 社에는 入金되여있지안는 것이 發覺되엿다.
그래서 外部에서는 이것이 詐欺罪를 構成한다느니 背任罪를 構成한다느니 여러 가지 說이 많엇은데 엇재든 數日前幹部會席上에서 成尹兩氏가 그 八萬圓을 現金으로 九月二十日까지 社에내어노키로 言明이있었다는대 일하야 이제는 八萬圓의 資金까지있음으로 當局의 諒解만있다면 곳 續刊할수 있게되리라한다.＜34＞
