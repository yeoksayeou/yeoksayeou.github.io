Ch'unwŏn's writing severely criticizing the barbarism [observed] on the morning streetcar – there are many gentlemen who sympathize. What comes to mind at this time are the Western-suit-wearing barbarian types (蠻種) who talk loudly in teahouses, disrupt the movie (춤 배앗흐며) in cinemas, and whisper during concerts – how very many they are! When I think of having to live alongside this crowd for my sixty years of life, I become depressed. <35>

**Summary**

This short piece expresses agreement with an article by the writer Ch'unwŏn condemning poor public manners observed on a streetcar. The author then laments the prevalence of similar "barbaric" behavior – loud talking in teahouses, disruptions in cinemas, whispering during concerts – among Koreans who adopt Western clothing. The author despairs at the thought of sharing society with such individuals. From a historical perspective, the article is interesting as it reflects contemporary anxieties about social etiquette during a period of rapid modernization and colonial influence. The juxtaposition of Western attire with perceived "uncivilized" behavior, and the use of the derogatory term "蠻種" (barbarian type), potentially reveals internalized colonial standards of conduct or class-based criticism within Korean society, offering insight into social commentary of the time.
