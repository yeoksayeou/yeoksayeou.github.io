If You Connect the Blood Vessels

If you were to gather up and connect all the blood vessels spread throughout the arms, back, and entire body of a single person, don't be surprised: it's said they would stretch about 2,000 *ri*. If it were 2,000 miles, that would be about 10,000 *ri*, which means it could wrap around the three thousand *ri* of Chosŏn three times.<212>

**Summary**

This short piece marvels at the total length of blood vessels within a single human body. It estimates this length at 2,000 *ri* (a traditional Korean unit of distance, approx. 786 km). It then makes a comparison, stating that if the length were 2,000 miles (approx. 10,000 *ri* or 3,218 km), it would be enough to encircle Korea (traditionally called "Samch'ŏlli" or 3,000 *ri*) three times. For historians, this article offers a glimpse into the dissemination of basic scientific or anatomical knowledge in colonial Korea, framed using familiar Korean units (*ri*) and cultural references (Samch'ŏlli Korea), even while introducing Western units (miles). The comparison highlights an attempt to make a foreign concept relatable, although the figures themselves might reflect the scientific understanding or estimations of the era.
