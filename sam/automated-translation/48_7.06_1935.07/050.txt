Gathering for Coolness at Kyŏngp'o
						Sop'a Han Chun-sŏk

Hot wind stirs; borrowing coolness,
Seeking fine views, wandering with a staff, I tread upon the scenic beauty.

Visiting the long shore, fit for washing away the grime,
A song of blue waves answers with rich blessings.<59>

**Summary**

This short Hanja poem by Han Chun-sŏk describes a summer outing to Kyŏngp'o (a famous lagoon on Korea's east coast) to escape the heat. The poet enjoys the beautiful scenery while walking with a staff and finds refreshment by the shore, feeling blessed by the natural surroundings. From a historical perspective, the poem offers a glimpse into the leisure activities and appreciation of natural beauty among some Koreans, likely the educated elite familiar with classical Chinese poetry forms, during the Japanese colonial period. It reflects a continuation of traditional literary practices and themes even under colonial rule.
