夏日穿島船遊
						小坡 韓準錫
吾州自古稱名區
暇日偶成物外遊

簫鼓醉過斷崖下
仙緣何必在瀛洲<61>

***

My region has been called a famous place since ancient times;
On a day off, I happened to enjoy an otherworldly outing.

Drunkenly passing below the sheer cliffs with flute and drum music,
Why must immortal fate be only in Yŏngju? <61>

**Summary**

This short poem by Han Chun-sŏk describes a leisurely summer boat trip in his home region, noted for its beauty. Accompanied by music, he passes by cliffs, feeling a sense of transcendence and questioning the need to seek mythical lands like Yŏngju to find such sublime experiences. From a historical perspective, the poem reflects the continuation of traditional literati pastimes (like composing Hanmun poetry about nature excursions) during the colonial period. It suggests a finding of solace and appreciation in local Korean landscapes, subtly asserting their value against legendary ideals, which might interest historians studying cultural continuity and expressions of local identity under colonial rule.
