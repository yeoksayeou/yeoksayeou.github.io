Price List (Joke)

To a young man asking for the hand of Rich Man Choe's daughter:

"So, you say you want to become my son-in-law. Before that, there's something I must ask. When I marry off my daughters, I send them all off with a dowry (持叅金). For my third daughter, who is eighteen this year, it's 10,000 won; for my second daughter, who is twenty, it's 20,000 won; for my eldest daughter, who is twenty-eight, it's 30,000 won. And if you take my wife, I'll give you half my fortune (財産). What do you say? Which will you choose?" <237>

**Summary**

This short piece presents a joke where a wealthy father, "Rich Man Choe," outlines the dowries he will provide for his daughters of different ages to a prospective son-in-law. The dowry amount increases significantly with the daughter's age, culminating in an offer of half his fortune if the suitor takes his wife instead. The joke humorously commodifies marriage and family members, assigning monetary value based on perceived desirability (or the father's eagerness to marry them off). From a historical perspective, the joke touches upon marriage customs (dowries - 持叅金), reflects contemporary perceptions of wealth and marriage as a transaction, and uses humor to comment possibly on changing social values or the perceived burden of older unmarried daughters (and perhaps even wives) in 1930s Korea. The specific monetary values (10,000 to 30,000 Won, plus half a fortune) also offer a glimpse into economic scales or aspirations of the time, even within a humorous context.
