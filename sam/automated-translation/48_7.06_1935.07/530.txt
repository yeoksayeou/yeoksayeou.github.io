**Summary**

This short piece consists of two identical public thank-you notes published in the magazine *Samch'ŏlli*. Ko Hansŭng and Kwŏn Yŏnguk express their gratitude to the voters of Kaesŏng-bu (Kaesŏng Prefecture) for electing them as council members (府會 議員). For historians, this article provides concrete evidence of local-level elections (specifically for the Prefectural Council or *Bu-hoe*) occurring in Korea during the Japanese colonial period in 1935, and indicates the participation of named Koreans (Ko Hansŭng, Kwŏn Yŏnguk) in this limited form of local governance. The use of a popular magazine for such announcements highlights the intersection of media and local politics.
