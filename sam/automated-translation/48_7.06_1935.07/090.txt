探勝一行乘暇休
玉松洞裏作勝遊

灑風浴海納凉足
不覺夕暉斜驛頭<64>

The sightseeing group, taking a leisurely break,
Enjoys a fine outing within Oksongdong.

Feeling the cool breeze and bathing in the scenic expanse, coolness is abundant,
Unaware, the evening sun slants over the station head.<64>

**Summary**

This short Hanja poem by Han Chun-sŏk describes a sightseeing group from Hamhŭng enjoying a refreshing summer day trip to Oksongdong. They relax, appreciate the scenery and cool breeze, losing track of time until the evening sun sets near the station. From a historical perspective, the poem highlights the existence of organized leisure activities like sightseeing tours for Koreans during the colonial period, suggesting a degree of social activity and perhaps burgeoning tourism. The continued use of Hanja poetry (漢詩) also points to the persistence of traditional literary culture among the educated class.
