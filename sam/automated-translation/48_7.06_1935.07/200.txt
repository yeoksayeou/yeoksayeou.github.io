Are there any "female heroes" (女傑) in Chosŏn? Someone capable enough to be entrusted with a newspaper company or a school...

Kim Tong-in - A "female hero" should probably refer to politics, but that's impossible to say; in my eyes, there isn't an outstanding woman capable of being entrusted as a newspaper president or a professional school principal.
Yi In - Female educators like Kim Chŏng-in and Wang Chae-dŏk are probably the closest to "female heroes."
Yi Ki-se - "Female heroes," you say. It's probably correct to say there are none. There aren't even any "male heroes" (男傑), so what kind of "female hero" could there be?
Kim An-sŏ - There are none. They are all below men.
Pak Ch'ang-hun - Medically speaking, their cerebrums are said to be inferior.

Do you regret not having a love marriage?

Pak Ch'ang-hun - Perhaps because I couldn't have a love marriage, I feel very envious when I see others dating and then getting married.
Yi Ki-se - If marrying because they liked each other is a love marriage, then I also had a love marriage, so I'm not particularly envious.
Kim Tong-in - There's probably no great difference between a love marriage and just getting married.
Yi In - A person's happiness or unhappiness doesn't depend on whether they had a love marriage, so when I think about it, I don't really feel any regret.
Kim Ŏk - I've never regretted it. I count myself among those who had a love marriage too.

How does the intellectual level of Chosŏn women compare to those in foreign countries?

Yi In - Probably about the same as Annam women in general.
Pak Ch'ang-hun - They are not an uncivilized race (未開人種). They reach the level of civilized nations (文明民族).
Kim Tong-in - Their culture/refinement (교양) is quite high. Especially compared to American society, which treats women as accessories (佩物視), their status, character, and knowledge are certainly superior.
Kim Ŏk - Judging even by their faces, they have progressed much further than Annam or India.<109, 111, 113>

**Summary**

This article presents responses from several Korean male intellectuals in 1935 to survey questions about the existence of capable women ("female heroes") in Chosŏn, regret over not having a love marriage, and the intellectual level of Korean women compared internationally. Opinions on female capability are generally dismissive, ranging from denying their existence to citing perceived biological inferiority, though some acknowledge female educators. Views on love marriage vary, with some expressing envy and others indifference or claiming their own arranged marriage was essentially based on affection. When comparing Korean women internationally, responses place them above "uncivilized races" but vary widely, from comparing them to Vietnamese women to asserting their superiority over American women due to perceived better status and intellect, despite American society being critiqued. Historically, the article reveals prevalent patriarchal attitudes among male elites in colonial Korea, their awareness of and engagement with concepts like "love marriage" (a modern import), and their complex positioning of Korean women's status and intellect relative to both Western and other Asian nations, reflecting anxieties and assertions tied to colonial modernity and nationalism.
