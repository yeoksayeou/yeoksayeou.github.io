Urgent Notice to Our Esteemed Readers!

1.  If there is not yet a "Samch'ŏlli" branch office or sales outlet in your esteemed locality (貴地), please exert yourself (盡力) to establish one (there are internal regulations for becoming a branch office with profit and without a security deposit (保證金); if you request them, we will present (進呈) them).

2.  When sending money, if you send it via postal transfer savings (振替貯金), it will be deposited without fail (틀님업시). If the magazine does not arrive within 20 days after sending the money, it has been lost in transit (中途紛失). In that case, please send a letter to the main office stating "Magazine Not Received (冊不着)," and we will investigate and resend (再送) it.

Samch'ŏnsa Business Department <64>

**Summary**

This notice from the Samch'ŏnsa Business Department urges readers to help expand the magazine's distribution by establishing local branches, particularly in areas without existing outlets, offering incentives like profit-sharing without requiring a security deposit. It also provides instructions for payment via postal transfer and outlines the procedure for reporting and resolving non-delivery issues, promising investigation and reshipment if a magazine is lost in transit. For historians, this piece offers insight into the business and distribution practices of a Korean magazine during the colonial period. It highlights reliance on reader networks for expansion, the use of the postal system (specifically 振替貯金) for financial transactions and logistics, and the publisher's customer service approach to delivery problems.
