海上層巖巖上樓
松林鬱鬱不知秋

天藏地秘名初著
十景咸南讓一頭<63>

On the sea, layered rocks; upon the rocks, a pavilion.
The pine forest, lush and dense, knows not autumn.

Heaven-hidden, earth-concealed, its fame first becomes known.
Among the Ten Sights of Hamnam, it yields the top spot [to none].<63>

**Summary**

This short Hanja poem by Han Chun-sŏk praises the scenic beauty of Songdo, likely referring to the Songdo near Wŏnsan in South Hamgyŏng Province (Hamnam). It describes the island's rocky landscape by the sea, topped with a pavilion, and its evergreen pine forest that seems untouched by autumn. The poem emphasizes the island's formerly hidden nature ("Heaven-hidden, earth-concealed") and declares it the foremost of the ten famous sights in the Hamnam region. From a historical perspective, the poem reflects the appreciation of traditional Korean landscapes and the use of classical Chinese poetic forms (Hansi) by Korean intellectuals during the colonial period, even within a popular contemporary magazine like Samch'ŏlli. It showcases local pride in a specific scenic location.
