The Peacock's Feathers
Isn't the peacock called a very beautiful bird? But do you know how many feathers that peacock uses to decorate its whole body so luxuriously? It is said it plays the part of a beauty for the ages with merely eighteen shafts.<214>

**Summary**

This very short article notes that the peacock, despite its reputation for beauty and luxurious appearance, achieves this effect using only eighteen tail feathers. It compares the peacock's ability to appear grand with few feathers to a timeless beauty. From a historical perspective, this piece represents the kind of light, miscellaneous content published in popular magazines like *Samch'ŏlli* during the colonial period. It offers a glimpse into general knowledge or trivia shared with readers, perhaps reflecting an interest in the exotic or natural world, but holds little direct significance regarding major political or social issues of 1930s Korea.
