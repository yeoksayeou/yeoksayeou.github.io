Oh Mother
						Sin Sŏkchŏng (辛夕汀)

If only I had wings that sprouted,

Like a little mountain bird, flutter flutter, flying far away,
I would seek out the star fields in the brilliantly blooming night sky,
And become a gardener (園丁), tending the star fields...
And so, if a shooting star (流星) is seen in the lonely night sky,
Know that it is my mischief, carefully picking the stars blooming in the garden and throwing them.

But Mother—
Why is it that I have no wings?

Mother—
If only I had wings that sprouted,
I would fly through the sky, red like an apple (林檎) in the evening sun (夕陽),
Looking far upon the round earth,
And become a shepherd boy (牧童) raising jade rabbits, going to the moon country...
And so, if the sound of a flute comes drifting on a blue moonlit night,
Know that it is my jade flute, played in the moon country while herding rabbits home in the evening sun (夕陽).

But Mother—
Why is it that I have no wings? -(The End)-<29>

**Summary**

This poem, "Oh Mother," by Sin Sŏkchŏng, expresses a child's innocent and imaginative yearning for wings. The speaker wishes to fly to the stars to become a "gardener of stars" and to the moon to become a "shepherd boy" tending jade rabbits, sending signals back to their mother through shooting stars and flute melodies. Each stanza ends with the poignant question to the mother: "Why is it that I have no wings?" From a historical perspective, the poem, written during the Japanese colonial period, could be interpreted as reflecting a subtle longing for freedom, escape, or transcendence beyond earthly limitations and the constraints of the time. Historians might find interest in its use of lyrical imagination as a potential form of escapism or quiet resistance, as well as its representation of Korean poetic sensibility and older linguistic forms from the 1930s.

어머니여
						辛夕汀
만일 나의게 날개가 돗첫다면

산ㅅ새색기 포르르 포르르 멀니 날어가듯
찬란히 피는 밤한울의 별바틀 차저가서
나는 園丁이 되오리다 별바틀 지키는...
그리하야 적적한 밤한울에 流星이 뵈이거든
동산에 피는 별을 고이따던지는 나의작란인줄 아시오

그런대 어머니-
어찌하야 나의게는 날개가 업슬가요?

어머니-
만일 나의게 날개가 돗첫다면
夕陽에 林檎가치 붉은 한울을 날러서
똥그란 지구를 멀니 바라보며
옥톡기 길우는 牧童이 되오리다 달나라에 가서...
그리하야 푸른달ㅅ밤 피리ㅅ소리 들여오거든
夕陽에 톡기몰고 돌아가며 달나라에서 부는 나의 옥통소인 줄 아시오.

그런데 어머니-
어찌하야 나의게는 날개가 업슬까요? -(끗)-<29>
