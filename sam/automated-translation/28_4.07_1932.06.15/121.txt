No sooner had the words left my lips than she seemed to realize sharply, pulled my arm, and indicated I should follow her into her room. Having come this far, I wanted to go into her room and see what scene would unfold next.

Stepping inside the door, the electric lights were not turned on. Although I followed the woman up a high staircase, I didn't know how many floors it was, and my heart felt like that of a soldier infiltrating an enemy camp – terrifying and unsettling. Reaching the third floor, a room door opened. Inside, three Russian men were gathered around a round table (圓卓), maps spread out, marking them with red ink and murmuring something. A brief look showed that the large, empty room contained only one round table and three or four chairs, nothing else. On the walls hung maps of Asia (亞細亞地圖), Europe (歐羅巴地圖), and street maps of Harbin (哈爾賓) and Vladivostok (海蔘威). Thinking this must be some kind of detective agency made me even more apprehensive. Passing through that room again, we went through three other living quarters before finally reaching the woman's room. Though I had followed her this far, I suddenly felt terrified and wanted to escape this place as quickly as possible, somehow.

Inside the room, there was one bed (寢臺), a small wardrobe (衣籠), and just two or three chairs. Entering the room, I looked around carefully. Then, I briefly recalled the scene of the three Russian men leaning over the round table, murmuring something, and the path I had taken through three other living quarters to reach this room. Looking back, I couldn't bear to stay in that room any longer. So, I shouted, "I'm leaving!" and ran out. However, it was the first time I had entered the house, and the hallway lights weren't on, so finding the way out was a problem.

The woman chasing me from behind was urgent, making me even more frantic. I opened this room door and that room door, enacting a great action scene. Every room belonged to a Russian family. Seeing me running around frantically, some laughed, while others looked up at me as if frightened. When I asked which door led outside, unaware of my plight, it was the housewife who first offered comfort and reassurance, saying, "God is watching over you, so don't worry," and kindly gave directions. The men, however, didn't even glance up and just continued their conversations. After repeating this several times, I finally made it down to the lower floor and found the exit door.

Stepping outside the gate, it was already past the third watch of the night, the passersby had all disappeared, and a single empty horse-drawn carriage was wandering by.
As I called it over, urging it to take me outside the city limits (道外), the Russian woman followed me out to the gate, stood there, and seemed to be muttering something to herself, showering me with curses.<27>

**Summary**

The narrator recounts a tense and fearful experience after following a woman into a multi-story building, presumably in a Russian-influenced city like Harbin or Vladivostok. Inside, they discover a sparsely furnished room where three Russian men are mysteriously studying maps, leading the narrator to suspect espionage. Fleeing through several Russian family apartments in a panic, the narrator receives unexpected kindness from a Russian housewife before finally escaping into the late night and hailing a carriage, pursued by the curses of the woman who led them there. From a historical perspective, the article offers a glimpse into the atmosphere of cities with significant Russian populations frequented by Koreans during the colonial period. The depiction of the Russians—some potentially involved in clandestine activities, others living ordinary domestic lives—and the narrator's palpable fear and sense of disorientation in this foreign environment highlight the complexities and anxieties Koreans might have faced in such transnational spaces under Japanese rule.
