One Hand Higher

Kilnam: "Father, last night in my dream, I received 10 *chŏn* that you gave me."
Father: "Oh, that's good. Keep that money safe."

Night and Day

Ok-hŭi: "Excuse me. How are friendship and love different?"
Ch'unsik: "Well, it's just the meeting of night and day, isn't it? (Reporter's Note - Meaning friendship is something that happens during the day, and love is something that happens at night)"<13>

**Summary**

This article presents two short jokes. The first involves a boy telling his father about a dream where he received money, and the father humorously advises him to keep the dream money safe. The second joke defines the difference between friendship and love as the difference between day and night, with a reporter's note clarifying that friendship is for the daytime and love (implying intimacy) is for the nighttime. For historians, these jokes offer a small window into the humor, colloquial language (including older spellings), and social values of 1930s Korea, touching upon parent-child interactions regarding money and contrasting social versus romantic relationships. The specific monetary amount (10 *chŏn*) might also provide context for everyday economic life.
