Hŏ Hŏn's Father and Daughter and Chŏng Chong-myŏng's Mother and Son

Currently, inside Sŏdaemun Prison, there are Hŏ Hŏn and his daughter (許憲 父女), a father and daughter serving prison sentences together. Hŏ Hŏn (許憲) is serving time for the Mass Movement Activists Conference Incident (민중운동자대회사건) along with Hong Myŏng-hŭi (洪命憙), Yi Kwan-yong (李灌鎔), and Cho Pyŏng-ok (趙炳玉), and his daughter Hŏ Chŏng-suk (許貞琡) is imprisoned in connection with student strikes (학생맹휴) and Party (黨) affairs. Is it not a strange fate (기연) that they eat rice cooked in the same pot under the same roof?

On the other hand, there is Chŏng Chong-myŏng (鄭鍾鳴), former chairwoman of the Kŭn'uhoe (槿友會) Central Executive Committee, imprisoned in connection with the 5th Party (黨) affair, and also her son Pak Hong-je (朴弘濟); the son is imprisoned as a perpetrator of seditious circulars (檄文犯) from the time of the Kwangju Student Incident (光州學生事變). They too live under the same roof, eating rice from the same pot. Truly, are they not a pair of strange fates? <32>

**Summary**

This short article highlights the "strange fate" of two families imprisoned together in Sŏdaemun Prison during the Japanese colonial period. It describes Hŏ Hŏn, imprisoned for the Mass Movement Activists Conference Incident, sharing the prison with his daughter Hŏ Chŏng-suk, jailed for student strikes and Party activities. It also mentions Chŏng Chong-myŏng, former Kŭn'uhoe chairwoman, imprisoned for Party affairs, sharing the same prison with her son Pak Hong-je, who was jailed for distributing seditious materials during the Kwangju Student Incident. The article emphasizes the unusual circumstance of close family members being incarcerated together for their involvement in resistance activities. For historians, this piece offers a glimpse into the personal costs and familial involvement in the anti-colonial movement, naming specific individuals, associated incidents (like the Kwangju Student Incident and the Mass Movement Activists Conference), and organizations (Kŭn'uhoe, implied political 'Party'), underscoring Sŏdaemun Prison's role as a central site for incarcerating political prisoners from various backgrounds and generations.
