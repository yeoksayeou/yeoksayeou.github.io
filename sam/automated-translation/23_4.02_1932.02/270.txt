**Summary**

This is a brief company announcement (社告) from the Samch'ŏlli Company's Business Department published in the February 1932 issue of Samch'ŏlli magazine. It seeks individuals or entities interested in establishing branch offices (지사) and sales outlets (판매소) for the magazine across the 13 provinces (13도) of Korea.
