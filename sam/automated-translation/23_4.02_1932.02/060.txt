**Speed Era**

Hyesuk, a student at a certain girls' school, wanting to test the heart of her boyfriend Chŏngsik whom she was planning to marry, asked Ok-hŭi from the same class:

Hyesuk: Ok-hŭi, I'm sorry to ask, but could you please go for a walk with Mr. Chŏngsik to Changch'ungdan tomorrow? And then, when the time is right, won't you try persistently asking him for a kiss?

Though it was for a friend, asking an unrelated man for a kiss... after hesitating ten times, she finally agreed. Seeing her return from the walk the next day:

Hyesuk: So, Ok-hŭi. How was it? Did you ask Mr. Chŏngsik for a kiss?

Ok-hŭi: It failed. There was simply no chance to do so.

Hyesuk: Why? You really are a girl with no courage.

Ok-hŭi: What could I do? Before I could even say anything, he already kissed me...<11>

**Summary**

The article presents a short joke titled "Speed Era." A girl named Hyesuk asks her friend Ok-hŭi to test her boyfriend Chŏngsik's intentions by asking him for a kiss during a walk. Ok-hŭi reports failure, explaining that Chŏngsik kissed her before she even had the chance to ask him. This vignette humorously reflects the perception of rapidly changing social norms and the concept of "speed" associated with modernity in 1930s Korea, particularly concerning dating and interactions between young men and women. Historians might find the joke interesting as a small window into contemporary anxieties or observations about modernization, changing courtship practices, and perhaps subtle commentary on gender dynamics or perceived forwardness in the "speed era" of colonial Korea.
