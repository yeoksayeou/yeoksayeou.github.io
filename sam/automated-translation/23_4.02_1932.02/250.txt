**Body Text Translation:**
Urgent Notice

Our New Year issue has received an extraordinary welcome, and even after a huge number of copies were sold, orders are still continuing to come in. Therefore, we have unavoidably reprinted it. Those who need a copy, please send 30 Jeon (錢) and place your order. The remaining copies are few.

Business Department <67>

**Summary**

This is a brief announcement from the Business Department of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine. It informs readers that the New Year's issue was so popular it sold out, necessitating a reprint. Interested readers are encouraged to quickly order the reprinted issue by sending 30 Jeon, as supplies are limited. For historians, this short piece highlights the popularity and reach of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine in colonial Korea, indicating a significant readership willing to purchase it. The mention of a reprint suggests both successful marketing/content and perhaps underestimation of demand, while the price (30 Jeon) provides a data point for economic history concerning publication costs and consumer prices in the 1930s.
