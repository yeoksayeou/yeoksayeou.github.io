病床吟
						늘샘
―To Brother Son Simjŏn (心田) from my hometown, who visited me even in this sickroom—

―Meeting a Friend (逢友)―
In an empty, spacious room, day and night I am alone,
Thinking of news from home and of friends, I was about to forget myself,
Today, I gladly welcomed a longed-for friend and heard news from home.

―Heartfelt Talk (情話)―
When he opened the door and entered, it felt desolate, like a dream,
Sitting face-to-face with me, hearing with my ears and seeing with my eyes,
It felt as if this body flew lightly and went to my hometown.

―Seeing Off a Friend (送友)―
Upon meeting and welcoming him, my heart felt reassured and trustworthy,
But as he was about to turn back and leave, my heart sank with a thud,
I just blankly watched his departing figure.

**Summary**

This three-stanza poem, titled "Song from a Sickbed," expresses the author Nŭlsaem's feelings while hospitalized in 1931. The stanzas depict the initial loneliness, the joy and comfort brought by a visit from a friend from home (Son Simjŏn), which felt like a brief escape back to his hometown, and the subsequent emptiness and sorrow upon the friend's departure. The poem captures the universal emotions of isolation during illness and the deep value of companionship. From a historical perspective, the poem offers a personal glimpse into life during the Japanese colonial period, showing an individual grappling with illness away from home, finding solace in friendship and hometown connections. The mention of a specific institution, the Masan Provincial Hospital (馬山道立醫院), grounds the personal experience within the infrastructure of the time, potentially of interest to historians studying healthcare or social conditions in colonial Korea.

―이날에 병실까지 차저주신 고향의 心田. 孫형의게―

―逢友―
휭덩글 빈방안을 밤낫업시 홀로 잇서
집소식 벗생각에 나도 나를 니즐러니
오늘은 그린 벗 반겨맛고 집소식도 들엇네.

―情話―
문열고 들어올제 꿈이런 듯 삭막하다
나라니 마주안저 귀로 듯고 눈에 보니
이몸이 훨훨 날아서 고향간 듯 하여라.

―送友―
맛내자 박길제란 마음 든든 밋추더니
되돌아 떠나랴니 가슴 덜령 나려안저
멀거니 가시는 양만 바라보고 말엇네.
