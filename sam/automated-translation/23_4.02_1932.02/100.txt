Samch'ŏlli "Wall Newspaper" (三千里 「壁新聞」)
First Release from Prison for the Mass Rally Incident (民衆大會事件)

Regarding the six individuals from the Sin'ganhoe (新幹會) – Hŏ Hŏn (許憲), Hong Myŏnghŭi (洪命憙), Cho Pyŏngok (趙炳玉), Yi Kwan'yong (李灌鎔), Yi Wŏnhyŏk (李源赫), and Kim Musam (金武森) – who were imprisoned on December 11, 1929, due to the famous Kwangju Student Incident (光州學生事件), it has already been four years by count. Among these six, Hŏ Hŏn, Hong Myŏnghŭi, and Yi Kwan'yong received sentences of 1 year and 6 months at that time, while Cho Pyŏngok, Yi Wŏnhyŏk, and Kim Musam received sentences of 1 year and 4 months and were serving their respective terms in Sŏdaemun Prison (서대문형무소). It is reported that on the upcoming February 7th, only the three individuals Cho Pyŏngok, Yi Wŏnhyŏk, and Kim Musam will be released first upon completion of their sentences. <28>

**Summary**

This news brief reports the impending release of three Sin'ganhoe members – Cho Pyŏngok, Yi Wŏnhyŏk, and Kim Musam – from Sŏdaemun Prison on February 7, 1932. They, along with three others (Hŏ Hŏn, Hong Myŏnghŭi, Yi Kwan'yong), had been imprisoned in December 1929 following the Gwangju Student Incident for their involvement in planning a "Mass Rally" (Minjung Taehoe). The article notes the different sentence lengths received by the two groups. From a historical perspective, this article is interesting as it documents the direct consequences faced by nationalist leaders associated with the Sin'ganhoe for attempting to organize public demonstrations in response to major colonial-era events like the Gwangju Student Incident. It highlights the colonial state's suppression of organized nationalist activities and provides specific details about the imprisonment and release dates of key figures.
