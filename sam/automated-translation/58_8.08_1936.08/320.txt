Book of Odes
						Kim An-sŏ
The Han River is wide (Han Guang, Three Stanzas)
It is a branchless tree, so there is no shade	(South has tall trees)

However much I wish to rest, how could I obtain it?	(Cannot rest)

By the Han River, maidens are so very many	(The Han has wandering women)

But there is not one way to know my heart.	(Cannot be sought)

The Han River is wide and broad, only water	(The Han is broad)

Could one swim across that watery expanse?	(Cannot be swum)

This long, long Jiang River has no end	(The Jiang is long)

Could one even descend it by riding a raft?	(Cannot be traversed by raft)


In the field where mixed weeds grow unevenly	(Tall bundles of firewood)

Gently, gently cutting this Chu grass	(Happily cut the Chu)

When our maidens go to be married	(When this child goes home)

Shall I make it fodder for the horse they ride? <268>	(Let us fodder her horse)

The Han River is wide and broad, only water	(The Han is broad)

Could one swim across that watery expanse?	(Cannot be swum)

This long, long Jiang River has no end	(The Jiang is long)

Could one even descend it by riding a raft?	(Cannot be traversed by raft)


In the field where mixed weeds grow unevenly	(Tall bundles of firewood)

Rustling, rustling, cutting the leaves	(Let us cut the mugwort)

When our maidens go to be married	(When this child goes home)

Shall I make it fodder for the colt?	(Let us fodder her colt)

The Han River is wide and broad, only water	(The Han is broad)

Could one swim across that watery expanse?	(Cannot be swum)

This long, long Jiang River has no end	(The Jiang is long)

Could one even descend it by riding a raft?	(Cannot be traversed by raft)


By the Bank of the Ru River (Ru Fen, Three Stanzas)

My situation is living by the bank of the Ru River	(Along the high bank of the Ru)

Last year too, I spent the time cutting wood.	(Cutting the branches and sprouts)

When my beloved lord was far away	(While I did not see my lord)

How must my sorrowful heart have been?	(I was anxious as if hungry)


My situation is living by the bank of the Ru River <269>	(Along the high bank of the Ru)

This year too, I lived cutting wood	(Cutting the tender branches)

Since my beloved lord has returned	(Now that I have seen my lord)

How can my joy be [described]?	(He has not cast me off)


They say the bream's tail becomes red	(The bream has a red tail)

The King's service is hardship like fire	(The royal house is like a blaze)

Though pressed by worry day and night	(Though it is like a blaze)

I was reassured by that virtue like parents'.	(My parents are very near)


Qilin (Lin Zhi Zhi, Three Stanzas)

The feet of the Qilin, shall I say?	(The feet of the Lin)

The magnanimous young lords	(The sincere sons of the Duke)

Ah, may the Qilin come!	(Alas, O Lin!)


The forehead of the Qilin, shall I say?	(The forehead of the Lin)

The magnanimous descendants of the King	(The sincere descendants of the Duke)

Ah, may the Qilin come!	(Alas, O Lin!)


The horn of the Qilin, shall I say?	(The horn of the Lin)

The magnanimous royal clan	(The sincere kinsmen of the Duke)

Ah, Qilin, Qilin, come!	(Alas, O Lin!) <270>

**Summary**

This article presents Korean translations by Kim An-sŏ of three poems from the ancient Chinese *Classic of Poetry* (*Shi Jing*): *Han Guang* (expressing unattainable longing for women by the Han River), *Ru Fen* (depicting a wife's worries while her husband is away on royal duty and her relief upon his return), and *Lin Zhi Zhi* (praising virtuous rulers and their kin by comparing them to the auspicious Qilin). For historians of colonial Korea, the article highlights the continued engagement with classical East Asian literature and its translation into vernacular Korean (using contemporary, albeit older, spellings) during the period. The choice of poems, dealing with themes of longing, hardship under authority, and the ideal of benevolent leadership, might subtly reflect the translator's or the readership's contemporary sentiments under Japanese rule.
