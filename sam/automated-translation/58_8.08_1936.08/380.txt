After Finishing Editing
						Editorial Department

The flower season has passed, the season of fresh green (新錄) has also passed, and now—the barley harvest (麥秋)—is upon us. Oh, how could the passage of time (歲月) be this fast?

As we now come to edit the September issue, where we will gaze upon the bright mid-autumn moon (仲秋明月), an illusion (幻想) arises as if branches of crimson autumn maple (丹楓) are placed in the flower vase (花甁) on the desk (冊床) in the editorial office (編輯室).

There is one thing for which we must deeply apologize (謝過): we were unable to publish the July issue. Several members (數氏) of the editorial department (偏執局) unfortunately had to travel to the provinces due to unavoidable (不得己) circumstances and were confined by illness, thus missing the date (日字) and skipping (闕) one month. Please forgive (容恕) us just this once.

Starting from the upcoming (來) September issue, we will absolutely publish before the 15th of each month. This time, all staff members (全사원) pledge this, staking our character (人格).<300>

**Summary**

The editorial department of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine apologizes to its readers for failing to publish the July 1936 issue. The reason given is that several staff members were simultaneously unavailable due to unavoidable provincial travel and illness. They express regret and promise that, starting with the upcoming September issue, the magazine will be published reliably before the 15th of every month, a promise they emphasize by stating the entire staff stakes their character on it. From a historical perspective, this notice highlights the practical difficulties faced by publishers during the colonial period, such as potential staffing issues or external pressures (though only illness and travel are explicitly mentioned). The strong emphasis on punctuality and the pledge of "character" might reflect anxieties about maintaining reader trust and operational stability under challenging circumstances.

						편집부
꼿철이 지나가고 新錄철이 또한 지나가고 이제-麥秋-가 다 닥처왓슴이다. 허허 歲月이 이러케 빨을 길 잇스리까.

이제는 仲秋明月을 바라볼 9月號를 編輯하게 되엇스매 編輯室冊床 머리花甁에는 붉게 물들인 丹楓가지 꼬처 있는듯한 幻想이 나나이다.

한가지 깁히 謝過할 말슴은 지난 7월호를 내지 못함이로소이다. 偏執局의 數氏가 그만 不得己한 지방여행과 병으로 누어알엇기 때문에 日字를 노치 한달을 闕하게 되엇나이다. 이번만 容恕하시압.

來 9월호부터는 매월 15일前으로 꼭 발행하겟나이다. 이것을 이번에는 全사원이 人格을 내걸고 공약하옵나이다.＜300＞
