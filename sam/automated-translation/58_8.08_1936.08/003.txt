Author: 申采浩 (Sin Ch'ae-ho)
Article Type: 시 (Poem)

Life at forty is nearly slow, slow.
Poverty and illness follow each other, never leaving for a moment.
What I regret most is the place where mountains end and waters run dry (山窮水盡處).
To sing or weep as feelings dictate is also difficult to do.<21>

**Summary**

This short poem expresses deep despair and hardship. The speaker laments reaching the age of forty while burdened by persistent poverty and illness, finding themselves in a desperate situation ("where mountains end and waters run dry") where even expressing emotion freely feels impossible. Given that the author, Sin Ch'ae-ho, was a prominent Korean independence activist who died in a Japanese prison in February 1936, this posthumously published poem likely reflects the immense suffering and hopelessness he experienced during his final years under colonial oppression. Historians might find this a poignant personal testament to the brutal realities faced by leading figures of the Korean independence movement.
