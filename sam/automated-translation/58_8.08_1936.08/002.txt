送友詞
						大院君

Sending you off a thousand li, the feeling of separation is difficult;
Beyond my expectations, Heaven's grace today is weighty.
At the northern border's cloud-covered mountains, news by wild goose is blocked;
When you came, it was bustling; when you leave, it is spring.

Old Stone (First Auspicious Day of the Sinsa Year)

Pak Chisan, Spring Clouds Returning Home

Fleeting life, separation and meeting, both feelings are deep;
This evening, tilting cups and parting for a journey.
Afterwards, how many thoughts will become dreams?
Before the wind, can letters plan the way forward?
Early spring, northern border, ■ returning wild goose;
New moon, south of the river, hearing the sleeping gull.
Stopping the horse at the riverbank, you wish to leave;
Tomorrow morning, the willows, shrouded in mist, rest.<19>

**Summary**

This article presents two traditional Hanja poems themed around parting with a friend. The first, shorter poem is attributed to the Taewŏn'gun (Regent Heungseon) and signed "Old Stone (First Auspicious Day of the Sinsa Year)," possibly dating it to 1881. It speaks of the sorrow of separation, reliance on heaven's grace, blocked communication from the north, and contrasts the friend's arrival with their departure in spring. The second, longer poem, possibly related to a person named Pak Chisan returning home, reflects on the transient nature of life, the emotions of parting and reunion, drinking together before separation, the uncertainty of the future and communication, and uses contrasting imagery of the northern border in early spring and the south under a new moon before concluding with the classic parting scene by the willows.

The publication of a poem attributed to the Taewŏn'gun in 1936 is interesting, showing continued reverence for figures from the late Chosŏn Dynasty during the colonial period. The themes of separation, distant locations (northern border, south of the river), and difficult communication likely resonated with contemporary readers experiencing displacement or separation due to colonial policies or economic hardship. The use of classical Chinese poetry format highlights the persistence of traditional literary culture.

送君千里離情難
念外天恩今日重
塞北雲山雁信塞
來時常市去時春

老石(辛巳上吉)

朴地山春雲歸家
浮生離合兩情幽
是夕傾罇而別遊
日後心思幾成夢
風前書信可謀行
早春塞北■歸雁
新月江南聞腄鷗
