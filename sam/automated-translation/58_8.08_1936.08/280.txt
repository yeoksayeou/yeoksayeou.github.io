						Wŏlt'an
Poet Sage Paek Nakch'ŏn (2) His Life and Art
Author Introduction
Mr. [Wŏlt'an] was born in Kyŏngsŏng and is 37 years old this year. He graduated early from Paejae High Common School, went over to Tōkyō, and devoted himself solely to the study of literary arts. Since the era of the ⌈Paekcho⌋ literary group, he has dedicated himself to the Chosŏn arts movement up to the present day.
His real name is ⌈Pak Chonghwa⌋. He previously released the work ⌈Hŭkpang Pigok⌋ (Secret Song of the Black Room), surprising our literary world. Up to the present, he has published numerous poetic works.

(Continued) The motivation for composing the masterpiece, ⌈P'ip'a haeng⌋ (Song of the Pipa Player), during His Excellency [Paek Nakch'ŏn]'s time in Kangju as a minor official, was as follows. The year after His Excellency was demoted and sent to Kangju, a friend came to visit. As the friend was about to return, His Excellency went to the P'yŏnp'o port to see him off. It was night, and from a boat tied up with mooring ropes near the port, a middle-aged woman was playing the p'ip'a (琵琶 - Chinese lute) so plaintively and skillfully that the poet Paek Nakch'ŏn was deeply moved and, shifting his feet, could not bear to leave her side. After listening for a short while, he heard that the woman's accent was that of the capital. His Excellency was overjoyed, as if meeting an old acquaintance from home in a distant land a thousand *li* away. Inquiring about the woman's background, he learned she was originally a woman from the capital. She had learned the p'ip'a from the famous masters Muk and Cho of that time and was called a master performer for a while. However, as she grew older and her face became haggard, not a single man of taste paid her any attention. Having no choice, she attached herself to a merchant and wandered about like this among the rivers and lakes (江湖間). His Excellency ordered a drinking table brought onto the boat and asked her to pluck a few tunes. This was the <242> catalyst for composing the P'ip'a haeng.

潯陽江頭夜送客. (At Xunyang River's head, seeing a guest off by night.)
楓葉萩花秋瑟瑟. (Maple leaves, bush clover flowers, autumn rustles, soughing.)
主人下首客在般. (The host dismounts, the guest is in the boat.)
擧酒欲飮無管絃. (Raising wine, wishing to drink, but no pipes or strings.)
醉不成歡慘將別. (Drunk but joyless, sadly about to part.)
別時茫茫江浸月. (Parting time, vast and boundless, the river drowns the moon.)
忽聞水上琵琶聲. (Suddenly hear, upon the water, the sound of a p'ip'a.)
主人妄歸客不發. (The host forgets returning, the guest does not depart.)

At the bend of Simyanggang's flowing water,
Deep in the night, I see off a guest,
Maple leaves and bush clover flowers are dense and wet,
Autumn is desolate, oh so sad.
The one sending off dismounts from his horse,
The person departing has boarded the boat.
Raising the wine to drink a cup,
Is there not a single flute or kŏmungo?
Tipsy but not merry, our hearts, <243>
Must we part so wretchedly?
Sad at parting, we grasp hands,
In the wide, wide river, the moon is submerged.
Listen! Upon the water, a p'ip'a tune,
The host cannot go, nor the guest leave.

尋聲音間彈者誰 (Seeking the sound, quietly asking, who plays?)
瑟琶聲停欲語遲. (The p'ip'a sound stops, seeming to speak, but slowly.)
移般相近邊相見 (Moving the boat nearer, approaching to meet,)
添酒回燈重開宴. (Adding wine, turning the lamp, reopening the feast.)
千呼萬喚始出來 (A thousand calls, ten thousand summons, only then she comes out,)
猶抱琵琶半遮面. (Still holding the p'ip'a, half-hiding her face.)
轉軸撥絃三兩聲 (Turning the pegs, plucking the strings, two or three sounds,)
未成曲調先有情. (Before the melody forms, feeling is already there.)

Seeking the sound, quietly asking, who is playing?
The p'ip'a sound ends, as if about to speak, hesitatingly.
Moving the boat closer to meet and see,
Pouring more wine, turning the lamp, we feast again.
Called a thousand, ten thousand times, she finally came,
Bashfully hiding her face behind the p'ip'a she held.
Turning the pegs, plucking the strings, two or three sounds, <244>
Before the tune resounds, there is feeling.

絃絃掩抑聲聲思 (String by string suppressed, sound by sound lamenting,)
似訴平生不得志. (As if complaining of a lifetime's thwarted ambitions.)
低眉信手續續彈 (Lowering her brow, letting her hands move freely, continuously playing,)
設盡心中無限恩. (Expressing fully the boundless grace within her heart.) (*Translator's Note: 恩 here likely means sorrow/regret, not grace/favor*)
輕攏慢撚撥復挑 (Lightly brushing, slowly twisting, plucking then lifting,)
初爲霓裳後六公. (First playing "Nisang," then "Yukgong.")
大絃嘈嘈如急雨 (The thick strings clatter like sudden rain,)
小絃切切如私語. (The thin strings murmur like secret whispers.)

Each string held and released, every sound,
Is a lament for ambitions unrealized in life.
With lowered brows, her hands move swiftly, continuously plucking,
Pouring out all the pent-up feelings in her heart.
Lightly held, slowly grasped,
Plucking and lifting again,
First it's Nisang, then Yukgong,
The thick strings resound boomingly like the sound of rain,
The thin strings go *taenggi-taenggi* like a whisper.

Note: Nisang and Yukgong are names of Chinese song tunes. <245>
<242-245>

**Summary**

This article segment introduces the Korean author Pak Chonghwa (pen name Wŏlt'an), detailing his education and involvement in the Korean literary scene since the "Paekcho" era. The main focus is on the renowned Tang dynasty Chinese poet Bai Juyi (Paek Nakch'ŏn), specifically recounting the circumstances that led Bai Juyi to write his famous poem "P'ip'a haeng" ("Song of the Pipa Player") while exiled in Jiangzhou (Kangju). It narrates his encounter with a former courtesan turned merchant's wife playing the pipa sorrowfully by the Xunyang River (Simyanggang), which inspired the poem. The article then presents the beginning verses of the poem in Hanja, followed by a Korean translation/interpretation. For historians, the article is interesting as it shows a prominent Korean intellectual engaging deeply with classical Chinese literature and presenting it to a Korean audience during the Japanese colonial period. It highlights the continuing influence of the East Asian classical tradition alongside the development of modern Korean literature and arts movements like "Paekcho". The author introduction also points to the transnational education (Korea and Japan) common for intellectuals of that era.

詩聖白樂天(2) 그의 生涯와 藝術
筆者紹介
씨는 京城출생으로 금년 37세이다. 일즉이 培材高普를 졸업하고 東京에 건너가 오로지 문예연구에 몰두하엿다. ⌈白潮⌋시대부터 조선예술운동에 몸을 바처 오늘에 이르신 분이다.
본명은 ⌈朴種和⌋ 일즉이 작품⌈黑房秘曲⌋을 내여 노와 우리 문단을 놀내엿다. 오늘에 이르는 동안 詩作의 발표가 許多하다.

(續) 公의 江州구양사리때 명작, ⌈琵琶行⌋을 지은 動機는 이러하다. 公이 江州로 左遷이 되야간 이듬해에 어느 친구가 차저왓다가 돌아가게 됨애, 湓浦라는 浦口로 公은 餞送을 나갓섯다. 때는 밤이 되엿는데 浦口가에 닷줄을 감고 매여논 배 가운데선 중년 여자 하나가 엇지도 처량하게 琵琶를 잘 타는지 시인 白樂天은 마음이 흔들리여, 발을 왼겨 참아 그 옆을 떠나지 못하엿다. 조금 잇다 들으니 그 여자는 말소리가 서울 여자다. 公은 엇지나 반가운지 千里他鄕에 故人을 하나 또 만난 격이다. 그 여자의 來歷을 캐여물으니 본시 서울 녀자로 그때 당시에 유명한 穆와 曺라는 사람에게 琵琶를 배워 한참 동안은 명창으로 불니웟다가 나히 늙고 얼골도 추하야 가니 풍류남자는 누구 한사람 돌아보는 사람이 없었다. 하는 수없이 장사하는 사람에게 몸을 맷기고 이러케 江湖間으로 떠도라 단인다 하얐다. 公은 술상을 뱃 가운데로 차려오라 하고 두어곡됴를 뜨드라 햇다. 이것이 琵琶行을 지은＜242＞ 기틀이다.

潯陽江頭夜送客.
楓葉萩花秋瑟瑟.
主人下首客在般.
擧酒欲飮無管絃.
醉不成歡慘將別.
別時茫茫江浸月.
忽聞水上琵琶聲.
主人妄歸客不發.

심양강 구비처 흐르는 물에
밤 깁허 나는 손을 보내오,
단풍잎 갈때꽂 욱어 젓구야
가을은 쓸쓸타, 구슯흐구료.
보내는 이는 말께 나리고
떠나갈 사람 배에 올랏네.
술드러 한잔 마시랴 하니
퉁소 한아, 검은고도 없단 말이냐.
얼근하나 좋치 않회, 우리의 마음,＜243＞
이러케도 초라하게 갈닌다드냐.
갈닐 때 석을퍼 손을 잡으니
넓고 넓은 강물엔 달이 잠겻네.
듯노라니 물우헤 비파 한곡됴
주인도 못가고 손도 못뜨네.

尋聲音間彈者誰
瑟琶聲停欲語遲.
移般相近邊相見
添酒回燈重開宴.
千呼萬喚始出來
猶抱琵琶半遮面.
轉軸撥絃三兩聲
未成曲調先有情.

소리차저 가만히 뉘 뜻는 게요?
비파소리 끗치며 말할 듯 할 듯.
배를 왼겨 갓가히 만나서 보고
술딸코 등불 돌려, 다시 마시네.
천만번을 불러서 겨우 왓스나
붓끄런양 비파안에 얼골 가리네.
바듸굴녀 줄툭이는 두서너 소리＜244＞
곡됴가 울기 전에 정이 잇구료.

絃絃掩抑聲聲思
似訴平生不得志.
低眉信手續續彈
設盡心中無限恩.
輕攏慢撚撥復挑
初爲霓裳後六公.
大絃嘈嘈如急雨
小絃切切如私語.

줄줄이 들고 주는 소리소리는
평생에 뜻못어든 하소로구려.
아미 숙여 손 빨리 자주 뜨드니
가슴속 서린 회포 다 쏘다지네.
가볍게 가지고 늘이게 잡어
골르고 다시 툭기니
처음엔 霓裳이요 뒤엔 六公과
큰 줄은 우둥우둥 비ㅅ소리 갓고
작은 줄은 댕기댕기 속색임 갓다.

註  霓裳公과 六公은 中國노래의 곡됴 일홈이다.＜245＞
