An 8,000 Yen Windfall

Mr. Hŏ Chae-dŏk (許在德氏), an employee in the accounting section of the Tan-gun (端郡) Office in Hamgyŏngnamdo (咸鏡南道), had reluctantly been forced by a friend to accept two Industrial Promotion Bonds (勸業債券) instead of money owed to him. Completely unexpectedly, the other day, one bond won 5,000 Yen and the other won 3,000 Yen, suddenly making him rich with 8,000 Yen. A person's destiny (分福)—it's truly something you never know. <107>

**Summary**

This short article reports on Mr. Hŏ Chae-dŏk, an employee in Tan-gun, Hamgyŏngnamdo, who unexpectedly won a total of 8,000 Yen from two Industrial Promotion Bonds he had reluctantly accepted as repayment for a debt. The piece highlights the unpredictability of fortune (分福). For historians, this piece offers a glimpse into the economic realities of colonial Korea, including personal debt, the circulation of bonds like the Industrial Promotion Bonds (勸業債券), and the significant impact such a large sum of money (8,000 Yen, a fortune at the time) could have on an individual's life. It also reflects common themes of luck and fate found in popular media of the era.
