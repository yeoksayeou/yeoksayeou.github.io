The Dance of Ms. Ch'oe Sŭng-hŭi
The Dance of Ms. Ch'oe Sŭng-hŭi
Here is the recent news regarding Ms. Ch'oe Sŭng-hŭi (崔承喜), who went to Tokyo (東京). Ms. Ch'oe Sŭng-hŭi is teaching dance to many students at the Ishii Baku Dance Institute (石井漠舞踊硏究所), and her husband, Mr. An Mak (安漠), attends Waseda Kōtō Gakuin (早稻田高等學院). Their young baby is said to be growing well.

Three Women Who Built Houses
Only a few days after Ms. Pak In-dŏk (朴仁德) built an East-West eclectic modern house within the old palace grounds of Tojŏnggung (都正宮), Ms. Yun Sŏng-sang (尹聖相) also built a semi-Western style (半洋製) house in Hongp'a-dong (紅把洞), and now Ms. Kim Cha-hye (金慈惠) is also starting to build a house. It seems this year has brought not only a bumper crop (豊年) in agriculture but also a bumper crop of houses for the new women (新女性諸氏).

**Summary**

This news brief provides updates on two topics: the activities of renowned dancer Ch'oe Sŭng-hŭi and her family in Tokyo, and the recent house-building activities of three prominent "new women" (Pak In-dŏk, Yun Sŏng-sang, Kim Cha-hye) in Seoul. Ch'oe is teaching dance at Ishii Baku's studio while her husband studies at Waseda. The second part notes the construction of modern or semi-Western houses by these women, framing it as a "bumper crop" mirroring agricultural success. From a colonial history perspective, the article highlights the transnational activities of Korean elites like Ch'oe Sŭng-hŭi seeking opportunities in Japan, the center of the empire. It also illuminates the changing social landscape in Korea, showcasing the emergence of educated, modern "new women" asserting their independence and status through significant investments like building Western-influenced homes, reflecting both cultural shifts and economic capabilities within a segment of colonial society.

崔承喜 女史의 舞踊
崔承喜 女史의 舞踊
東京으로 드러간 崔承喜 女史의 그 뒤 소식은 이러하다. 崔承喜 氏는 石井漠舞踊硏究所에서 만흔 제자에게 춤을 가르치고 잇스며 夫君 安漠 氏는 早稻田高等學院에 통학한다는데 어린 아기는 잘 커간다고요.

집 지은 3女人
朴仁德 氏가 都正宮 녯 궁궐 안에다가 동서양 절충식 모던주택을 지은 지가 불과 몃츨 아니되어서 또 尹聖相 氏가 紅把洞에다가 半洋製 집을 지어들고金慈惠 氏마저 집 짓기를 시작한다하니 금년은 農作만히 풍년이 아니라 신여성 諸氏의 주택풍년이 드러온 모양이다.
