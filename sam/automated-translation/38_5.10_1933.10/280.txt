**Body Text Translation:**
A Collection of Transformations from Mulberry Fields to Blue Seas, Acting Minister Becomes a Shop Clerk

In the old Korean Empire era, there was a man named Chŏng Hae-yong (鄭海鎔) who served as the acting Korean minister stationed in Japan (日本駐戱 韓國代理 公使). After the annexation, he served as a county magistrate (郡守) in some town in Hamgyŏngbuk-to Province. Now, he is working as a shop clerk (店員) at some paper goods store (紙物商) on Namdaemun Street (南大門通), counting out and selling sheets one or two at a time when customers come to buy cheaply for 5 chŏn or 10 chŏn. This is truly a case of mulberry fields turning into the blue sea (桑田碧海) for a prominent figure (人士). <46>

**Summary**

This short piece reports on the drastically changed circumstances of Chŏng Hae-yong, a man who was once an acting Korean minister to Japan during the Korean Empire and later a county magistrate in Hamgyŏngbuk-to under Japanese rule. By 1933, he had fallen to working as a shop clerk in a paper goods store on Namdaemun Street, selling small items. The article uses the idiom "mulberry fields turning into the blue sea" (桑田碧海) to emphasize the dramatic decline in his status. For historians, this brief note offers a glimpse into the personal consequences and social mobility (or lack thereof) experienced by some members of the former Korean elite under Japanese colonialism, showing how even those who initially held positions within the colonial administration could face significant downturns in fortune.
