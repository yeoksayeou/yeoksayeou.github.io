Era of High-Rise Buildings Standing Dense Like a Forest

Mr. Min Tae-sik (閔大植) has decided to demolish the buildings near the Central Mission Hall (中央傳道舘) east of the Central Young Men's Hall (中央靑年會舘) in Chongno, Seoul, and invest 200,000 won to construct a large four-story building. It is said that Shimizu Gumi (淸水組) will soon commence the work. The building is intended for rental offices and rental shops, and after its completion, it will add another distinctive feature to the Chongno area.

The location for the new Chosŏn Ilbo Company (朝鮮日報社) building, which they are constructing by investing some 180,000 won, is said to be next to the Yi Royal Art Exhibition Hall (李王職美術陳列舘) on T'aep'yŏng-t'ong (太平通). This is also expected to be completed next spring.

It is said that the expansion of the Tonga Ilbo Company (東亞日報社) building will make it exactly double its current size, to be built right next to its south side, and word is that a contract has already been made with Shimizu Gumi (淸水組). It seems construction will begin before long. <63>

**Summary**

This news item from October 1933 reports on several major construction projects in Seoul, signifying a move towards taller buildings. Mr. Min Tae-sik plans a four-story rental building on Chongno using the Japanese firm Shimizu Gumi. The Chosŏn Ilbo newspaper is building a new headquarters on T'aep'yŏng-t'ong, also set for completion next spring. The Tonga Ilbo newspaper is planning a major expansion, doubling its building size, reportedly also contracting Shimizu Gumi. From a historical perspective, the article highlights the modernization of Seoul's urban landscape during the colonial period, the significant capital investment involved, the emerging rivalry between major Korean newspapers (Chosŏn Ilbo and Tonga Ilbo) manifested in new buildings, and the prominent role of Japanese construction companies like Shimizu Gumi in these large-scale projects.
