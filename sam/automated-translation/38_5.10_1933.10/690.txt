Korean Sentiment Sung by an Overseas Poet
						Shiratori Shōgo

Willow

The spring of the willow, parted from in tears,
has come again.
Smoky rain,
dreams too are hazy, Ryōratō (綾羅島).
The threads of the willow writing on the water <118>
What are they repeating?
A bird sings.
The willow is long, and the day is long too.

Flowing gently and grandly, the Daidōkō (大洞江),
the boats are black boats,
the sails too are black.
Amid the green willows, flowers are red.

Even if the rain clears, my heart likely won't.
The rainbow is an illusion,
it quickly fades.
Let's sing Arirang in the willow shade.
<118-119>

**Summary**

This short poem by Japanese poet Shiratori Shōgo, titled "Willow," depicts a scene by the Taedong River (Daidōkō) near Nŭngna Island (Ryōratō), likely P'yŏngyang. It uses imagery of weeping willows, misty rain, black boats, and red flowers to evoke a melancholic atmosphere associated with parting and persistent sorrow, despite the arrival of spring. The poem concludes with a suggestion to sing the Korean folk song "Arirang" under the willows. From a historical perspective, the poem is interesting as it shows a Japanese writer engaging with Korean scenery and cultural elements (Arirang) during the colonial period. It reflects a certain romanticized, perhaps slightly melancholic, view of Korea prevalent among some Japanese intellectuals, focusing on natural beauty and folk traditions while subtly hinting at underlying sadness ("Even if the rain clears, my heart likely won't").

柳

泣にて別らた 柳の 春の
またも來たそ
煙ぶる雨
夢も霞むよ 綾羅島。
水に字をかく柳の糸の＜118＞
なにを 繰りごこ
鳥が 啼く。
柳 永うて日も 永い。

流れゆるや大やか  大洞江の
般は 黑ぶね
帆も 黑い。
柳みごりに 花赤い。

雨は晴れても は晴れめ。
虹は幻
すぐ消える。
アリラン唄はうよ柳かげ。
