Moonlight
						P'a'in

When the moonlight (달빛)
is bright like that,
somewhere there must be
someone plucking a p'ip'a (琵琶).

Sighing,
I close the door.
For one chased out of happiness,
the moon is burdensome, the p'ip'a (琵琶) is burdensome.

**Summary**

This short poem by P'a'in (Kim Tong-hwan) expresses a sense of melancholy and alienation. The speaker observes the beautiful moonlight and imagines the accompanying sound of a p'ip'a, traditionally associated with beauty or sorrowful longing. However, instead of finding solace, the speaker, feeling "chased out of happiness," closes the door, finding both the moonlight and the music burdensome. For historians, the poem offers a glimpse into the personal sentiments expressed during the colonial period. While not explicitly political, the feeling of being "chased out of happiness" and the rejection of conventional beauty could reflect the broader cultural and personal despair or displacement felt by some Koreans under Japanese rule. The use of the pen name P'a'in itself is significant, as Kim Tong-hwan was a known literary figure navigating the complexities of expression during this era.
