Change of Postal Transfer Account

Company Announcement

As we are expanding our company's operations (社務) at this time (今番), we have changed the postal transfer account (振替口座) as follows (左와 如히). Those ordering magazines or books (書籍) should make payments (拂込) using this account from now on (此番).

Postal Transfer Kyŏngsŏng 2949. Therefore (라서), the previous (從來) Postal Transfer Kyŏngsŏng 4284 has been abolished (廢止하엿슴니다).

**Summary**

Samch'ŏllisa, the publisher of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine, announces a change in its postal transfer account number due to business expansion. The new account is Kyŏngsŏng 2949, and the old one, Kyŏngsŏng 4284, is now discontinued. Customers are requested to use the new account number for payments related to magazine and book orders. This brief notice is interesting to historians as it reflects the operational details of a Korean publishing house during the colonial period, including its growth ("expanding our company's operations") and its use of the Japanese-era postal transfer system centered in Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul) for financial transactions.
