Collection of Disgusting Sights

Those who sit on the streetcar with their mouths hanging open!
Those who walk around with a toothpick in their mouth!
Those who walk around without fastening the buttons on their Western-style trousers!
Those who look at their own reflection in a mirror in front of others!
Those who get a permanent wave!

If only there were a law to slap each of these bastards ten times across the face! That person [who made the law] would surely become a great politician! <83>

**Summary**

This short piece lists five types of public behavior the author finds extremely irritating: sitting slack-jawed on a streetcar, walking with a toothpick, wearing unbuttoned trousers, checking one's appearance in public, and getting a permanent wave hairstyle. The author expresses a strong desire for a law imposing physical punishment (slapping) on offenders, suggesting such a lawmaker would be considered a great politician. From a historical perspective, the article offers a glimpse into social norms and public etiquette concerns in 1930s Korea, reflecting anxieties about modernization (Western clothing, hairstyles like permanent waves) and public conduct. It reveals contemporary pet peeves and a rather authoritarian or perhaps satirical view on enforcing social decorum.
