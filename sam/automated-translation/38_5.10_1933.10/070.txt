Autumn Wind
						Pa'in

On the blade of grass
Gradually, the moisture drains away

Life withering—
Isn't it just like that?

Facing the autumn wind
I lament that there is no eternity <18>

**Summary**

This short poem by Pa'in uses the image of a blade of grass losing its color in autumn to reflect on the fading of life and the transience of existence. Standing against the autumn wind, the speaker explicitly laments the lack of eternity. The poem captures a common lyrical theme of melancholy associated with autumn, expressing a sense of resignation or sorrow about impermanence. For historians, the poem reflects a lyrical sensibility prevalent in the period, potentially colored by the broader atmosphere of colonial Korea, where themes of loss, fading, and the search for meaning might resonate with the political and cultural climate, though the poem itself is primarily existential rather than political.
