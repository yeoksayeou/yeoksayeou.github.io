Freedom of the Body

Freedom of the Body
Guard: "Ah, excuse me. Swimming is prohibited in this sea."
Woman: "Why is that?"
Guard: "It's forbidden by law."
Woman: "Oh my, then why didn't you tell me before I took off my clothes?"
Guard: "Well, the law doesn't say anything about not taking off clothes."

Single Women
Some reckless fellow announced that there were 327,565 'old misses' living single within Chosŏn (朝鮮). He added that he stopped counting the number of single men because it wasn't interesting.

Ten Commandments
Pastor: "What happens if you break just one of the Ten Commandments, be it alcohol or lust (色)?"
Student: "Yes, sir. Nine commandments remain." <36>

**Summary**

This article presents three short, unrelated anecdotes or jokes. The first involves a humorous exchange at a beach where swimming is banned but undressing is not explicitly illegal. The second notes a statistic about the large number of unmarried women ("old misses") in Korea, contrasting it with the lack of interest in counting single men. The third is a witty retort from a student about the Ten Commandments, suggesting that breaking one still leaves the others intact. From a historical perspective, the article offers glimpses into social norms and attitudes in 1930s colonial Korea. The statistic on unmarried women provides demographic insight, while the jokes reflect contemporary humor, perhaps subtly commenting on regulations, gender roles, or even religious interpretation under colonial rule.
