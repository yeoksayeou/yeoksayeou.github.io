After the Coronation, in Scotland
Queen Victoria of Great Britain

For breakfast, I ate barley porridge. The taste was very good. Then, I went for a stroll. Everywhere I went, there were hills (동산), vast and beautiful, possessing the charm of mountains and fields. Following along the River Esk (에스크河流), I climbed a steep pass (嶮嶺) on foot and rested in a small pavilion (享子), then took a carriage for the return journey. Along the road, the local people (士民) crowded around the front and back [of the carriage], uttering cheers.

According to Albert's (아루벨드) words, the people of this place greatly resemble Germans (獨逸人). The old women all wear hats, and the young girls let their long hair hang down; among them were not a few who were beautiful. Looking at this was truly like a picture. On the way, we passed Lasswade Village (랏스웨ㅡ도村) and the park of the Melville area (메루삐루鄕); the garden scenery was extremely beautiful and lovely.

**Summary**

This article is presented as a diary entry by Queen Victoria of Great Britain, dated September 2, 1842, describing a day during her visit to Scotland shortly after her coronation. She details eating barley porridge, walking in the scenic landscape along the River Esk, resting in a pavilion, and returning by carriage amidst cheering crowds. She also notes Prince Albert's observation about the locals resembling Germans and comments on the beauty of the women and the scenery, particularly Lasswade and Melville Park. From the perspective of Korean colonial history, the publication of this translated diary entry in a Korean magazine in 1933 is interesting. It reflects a Korean readership's engagement with international figures and European culture, particularly royalty, during a period of suppressed national identity. Historians might find it significant as it shows an interest in a powerful female monarch and a functioning empire, potentially offering readers a form of escapism or a subtle point of comparison (or contrast) with their own colonized situation and the Japanese imperial system.
