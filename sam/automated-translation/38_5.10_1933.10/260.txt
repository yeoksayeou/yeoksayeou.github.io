**Body Text Translation:**
"Isn't there some kind of book that explains divorce law (離婚法) in detail?"

"Hmph. Are you planning to take the bar exam?"

"No. Actually, it's because I'm thinking of getting married..." <39>

**Summary**

This brief dialogue features one person inquiring about detailed books on divorce law, prompting the other to mistakenly assume they are studying for the bar exam. The punchline comes when the first person reveals they are asking because they are planning to get married, suggesting a need for meticulous preparation even for marriage, perhaps hinting at its potential dissolution. From a historical perspective, this snippet humorously reflects the societal adjustments and perhaps growing anxieties or cynicism surrounding marriage in 1930s colonial Korea, as modern legal concepts like divorce became more prominent. Historians might note it as an example of how changing legal frameworks and social norms were discussed and perceived in popular media.
