李商在時代의 十年
						具滋玉
一.
Mr. Yi Sang-jae (李商在) emerged onto the front lines of Christianity and was fully active for about 10 years; I believe this was precisely from the Im'in year (壬寅年, 1902 or more likely 1912 given context) until the early spring of the Pyŏngsul year (丙戌年, 1926).
I returned from America in the spring, two years after he assumed the presidency of the Christian Youth Association (基督敎靑年會), and worked under his direction in the Religious Department. Therefore, I don't know the earlier details well, but for the approximately 10 years before and after that, I was always under the Elder's command (配下), admiring his character and appearance, receiving his guidance, and standing at the forefront (旗頭) of the Korean Christian movement.
Regarding Elder Wŏllam (月南) Yi Sang-jae as the leader (首領) of a group, there is already an established reputation (定評) among the intellectuals of the generation, so there is nothing for me to reiterate now. However, the point where I was deeply impressed (心銘) that Elder Yi Sang-jae was a great man (巨人) was regarding the Kyŏngja year (庚子年, 1900) incident. (Abbreviated 畧) <43>
And just deciding to exchange secretaries (幹事) mutually to maintain liaison - if he had been a very difficult person, seven or eight out of ten people would not have been able to establish their position, yet he satisfactorily resolved this exceedingly difficult matter.
In general, the full measure of a great man (巨人) is not revealed in everyday trivial matters (小事), but rather in times of extraordinary crisis (非常之秋) - that is, when an organization faces ruin or prosperity, one can see their influence and spirit (氣慨) in skillfully managing the situation.
I will refrain from recounting anew his achievements during his time in government office (任官時代) or as Minister to the United States (駐米使臣時代), but in any case, the fact that he devoted his 70-year life solely to the prosperity of the nation (民族) and the work of Christianity truly leaves us, his juniors, only to look up in admiration.

During the 10 years the Elder served as leader (首領), the Christian Youth Associations (基督敎靑年會) throughout Korea (全朝鮮) were connected to organize the Federation (聯合會). The people who gathered under his wing (傘下) during these 10 years included Mr. Yun Ch'i-ho (尹致昊) as General Secretary (總務); as secretaries in the Education Department, Mr. An Chae-hong (安在鴻), who later became president of the Chosŏn Ilbo (朝鮮日報); the late Mr. Kim Il-sŏn (金一善), Kim Ch'ang-je (金昶濟), Yu Ŏk-kyŏm (兪億兼),
O Kyŏng-sŏn (吳兢善); and also Mr. Sin Hŭng-u (申興雨), Hong Pyŏng-sŏn (洪秉璇), Hyŏn Tong-wan (玄東完), Yuk Chŏng-su (陸定洙), and myself, among many others. While I cannot presumptuously (畏濫하게) offer critiques of these gentlemen's characters, they were all, in any case, individuals united in purpose (意思), with pure hearts (純一) and dedication (執誠) towards the work. That is why there was great progress (大飛躍) in all organizations and endeavors, whether in negotiations with external parties or control over internal affairs.
A further point to record is that the agreement mentioned earlier, concerning the exchange of secretaries with that other Christian Youth Association to establish mutual liaison, was entirely abrogated (破棄) immediately after the Kimyo year (己未卽後, i.e., after 1919) when Mr. Sin Hŭng-u was General Secretary, succeeding in building the foundation we have today.

If asked how many Christians there were during the golden age (全盛時代), according to our investigation at that time, excluding all those who were merely listed nominally as church members (敎人), the number of true believers (敎人) who had received baptism (洗禮) alone was over 200,000. Additionally, the number of Catholics (天主敎 즉 카트릭敎徒) reached nine hundred thousand and some thousands, meaning we could count 300,000 true believers (眞敎人) in total. [*Translator's Note: The math 200,000 + 900,000+ = 300,000 total seems incorrect as written in the original text. It might mean Protestants + Catholics = ~1.1 million, or perhaps 300,000 was intended for Protestants only, or there's a typo.*]
The subsidies coming from America were also larger than now, many capable people (人村, *likely 人材*) gathered, and having a leader like Yi Sang-jae, a man of character (人格者) for the ages <44>, it can truly be called an era of great progress (大飛躍時代).
What I still recall now is the scene at the cornerstone laying ceremony (定礎式) for this new Youth Association building. The ceremony at that time was conducted magnificently and grandly. His Highness the Yi King (李王殿下), when he was Crown Prince (世子), attended, Resident-General Itō (伊藤統監) was also present and gave congratulatory remarks, and the ministers of Great Britain and the United States were also present, showering praises that the first step of Peninsular civilization would begin here. <45>

**Summary**

The author, Ku Cha-ok, reminisces about the decade (roughly 1912-1926) when Yi Sang-jae led the Korean YMCA (Christian Youth Association). Ku worked under Yi and admired him greatly, considering him a "great man" particularly adept at handling crises. This period saw the unification of YMCA branches across Korea and significant growth, staffed by notable figures like Yun Ch'i-ho and An Chae-hong. Ku highlights the abrogation of an agreement for liaison with another (likely Japanese) YMCA after 1919 as a key step in establishing the Korean YMCA's independent foundation. He notes the substantial number of Christians (though figures seem contradictory) and large US subsidies during this "golden age," culminating in a grand cornerstone ceremony for the YMCA building attended by the Korean Crown Prince and Japanese Resident-General Itō. For colonial history, the article offers a perspective on the development of a key Korean civil society organization, its leadership under a respected nationalist figure (Yi Sang-jae), its relationship with Western support (US subsidies), and its navigation of the complex political landscape involving both Korean elites (Crown Prince) and Japanese colonial authorities (Itō). The mention of severing ties with the "other" YMCA post-1919 hints at rising nationalist sentiment within the organization.

李商在時代의 十年
						具滋玉
一.
李商在氏가 기독교의 第一線에 나오서서 全面的으로 活躍하기는 약 10년 동안이엇스니 그것은 바로 壬寅年으로부터 丙戌年 이른 봄까지엇다고 생각함니다.
나는 氏가 基督敎靑年會長으로 취임한 지 2년 후인 봄에 米國으로부터 비로소 도라 나와서 그 어른의 傘下에서 宗敎部의 일을 마터보고 잇섯슴으로 그 이전 일은 잘 모르지만 그 뒤의 전후 10년간 늘 선생의 配下에 잇서 人格風貌를 仰慕하면서 그의 지도를 밧어가며 朝鮮基督運動의 旗頭에 섯섯슴니다.
一團體의 首領으로서의 月南 李商在翁에 대하여는 이미 一世의 識者들로부터 定評이 잇는 터이라 이제 내가 重言할 것이 업슬지나 다만 나는 李商在翁이 巨人이엇다하고 깁히 心銘한 점은 그것이 庚子年 일이라. (畧)＜43＞
그리고 다만 幹事를 피차에 박구어 連絡을 취하기로하고 - 심히 어려운 사람이엇던면 十中七八人이 모다 주장을 세우지 못햇슬 이 심히 어려운 일을 만족하게 歸決을 짓고 마럿슴니다.
대체, 巨人이란, 일상의 小事에 그 전모가 나타나는 것이 아니라 非常之秋 - 즉 一機關이 亡하는냐 興하는냐 하는 때에 그를 잘 조정하는데 力重과 氣慨를 볼 수 잇슴니다.
翁이 任官時代 駐米使臣時代의 업적을 이제 새삼스럽게 말하기를 피하거니와 엇잿든 70평생을 오직 民族의 번영과 基督敎의 사업의 바친 점- 실로 우리들 후배는 우러러 봄이 잇슬 뿐이외다.

10년을 翁이 首領으로 게신 동안에 全朝鮮의 基督敎靑年會를 聯結하여 聯合會를 組織하엿슴니다. 그런데 이 10년 동안에 氏의 傘下에 모엿든 사람은 總務에 尹致昊氏 敎育部 幹事로는 후일 朝鮮日報 社長을 지낸 安在鴻氏, 前日 作故한 金一善氏, 金昶濟, 兪億兼
吳兢善의 諸氏와 또한 申興雨氏, 洪秉璇, 玄東完, 陸定洙, 이 사람 등 여러 사람이 잇지요. 내가 畏濫하게 諸氏의 人物評論할 수는 업스나 엇지 하엿든, 모다, 意思가 合一하고, 사업에 純一한 마음과 執誠을 가젓든 분들 뿐이외다. 그러기에 對外에 대한 交涉이란다든지 對內에 대한 統制란다든지, 모든 조직과 사업에 大飛躍이 잇섯든 터이외다.
더욱 기록할 일은 악가 말한 저편 基督敎靑年會와의 사이에 幹事를 교환하여 서로 연락을 맷는다 하든 그 協定도 己未卽後에 申興雨氏 總務時 모다 破棄하여 버리고 오직 금일의 地盤을 築成하기에 성공한 터이외다.

全盛時代에 基督敎徒는 얼마나 되엇드냐 하고 뭇는다면 그 당시 우리의 조사에 의하건대 敎人이라고 名目만 건 사람을 전부 빼여버리고 오직 「洗禮」을 밧은 참다운 敎人만이 20여만명이엇고 그리고 天主敎 즉 카트릭敎徒의 수가 90만 몃 천명에 달하엿섯스니 말하자면 眞敎人 30만인을 數할 줄 암니다.
米國서 나오든 보조금도 지금보다는 거액이엇고 人村도 만히 모엿고 首領으로는 李商在가튼  一代의 인격자을＜44＞ 모시엇스니 可謂 大飛躍時代라 할 것임니다.
지금도 回想되는 일은 이 靑年會 새 건물의 定礎式 때 광경이엇슴니다. 그때 式은 宏壯히 盛大하게 하엿는데 李王殿下께서 世子로 게실 때 伊藤統監도 來場하여 祝辭하엿스며 英米各國公使들도 來場하여 半島文明의 第一步는 여기서 시작될 것이라고 讚辭를 퍼부어 줍데다.＜45＞
