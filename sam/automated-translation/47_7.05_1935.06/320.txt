Record of the Academic Ranks of Wives

There are three ranks for wives. "Do not take an excellent wife. For the husband, it is a lifetime of sorrow."
If this were translated into Chinese characters, perhaps it would be "勿爲 有名 女性之夫兮" (Do not be the husband of a famous woman!).
If only a renowned writer like Li T'ai-po (李太白) had tossed off a line like this before dying, it would have become an eternal "source of self-consolation" for the tens of thousands of gentlemen who "wait upon their wives" or "stand behind their wives." In any case, being known only as "so-and-so's husband" while "so-and-so" himself remains unknown, for a man born into this world to wither away like a flower blooming in the shade due to his wife's virtue, is not a very pleasant affair. However, thinking it over, it is surely better than having a wife who is a "human wreck" (인간망난이) who doesn't even know the first letter of the alphabet. In any case, let us consider what kind of wives the "gentlemen" standing at the forefront of our society today have. Now, having established three ranks by considering the academic background (學力) of these wives (令夫人), let's briefly, though it may be discourteous, put these "gentlemen and ladies" into this framework and take a look.

Special Grade Class: Those who have an ultra-intellectual (울트라, 인테리) woman, a graduate of a university or specialized school, as a wife. <201>
Second Grade Class: Those who have an "intellectual" (인테리), a graduate of a Girls' High Common School, as a wife.
Third Grade Class: Those whose wives finished only at the level of elementary school, kindergarten, or just the basic ten-month fetal education—to speak plainly, though perhaps impolitely, those who have an "ignoramus" (無識쟁이) as a wife.

Special Grade Class
Well then, let's clench our eyes shut and perform the naming ceremony. Regarding women's universities, in Korea (朝鮮), Ewha Hakdang (梨花學堂) was once a women's university. Among its graduates at that time was Kim P'il-ae (金弼愛), a talented woman (才媛) noted for her good looks and proficiency in English. She later went to Peking (北京) and became the wife of the famous Dr. Kim Kyu-sik (金奎植), who was a professor at Peiyang University (北洋大學). Kim P'il-ae is the elder sister of Kim P'il-lye (金弼禮) who is now at a certain girls' school in Kwangju (光州).
Also at Ewha University were Pak In-dŏk (朴仁德), Kim Hwal-lan (金活蘭), Yun Sŏng-dŏk (尹聖德), and others, but for various reasons, they remain "Misses," so there's no point writing about them here. Since Peking (北京) was mentioned, Kim Wŏn-bong's (金元鳳) wife is Pak Ch'a-jŏng (朴次貞), who attended Huabei University (華北大學) and was also an executive member of the Kŭnuhoe (槿友會) upon returning to Seoul.
Also, though she has already passed away, Mrs. Kim Wŏn-gyŏng (金元慶), the wife of Ch'oe Ch'ang-sik (崔昌植) in Peking (北京), had only graduated from Kyŏngsŏng Government Girls' High School (京城官立女高), but it was the established opinion (定評) that through her overseas travels, her knowledge exceeded that of a university graduate. It is widely known that the wife of Dr. Sŏ Chae-p'il (徐載弼) in North America (北美) is a blonde beauty, a graduate of some university in Los Angeles.
What kind of men did the graduates of Mejiro Women's University (目白女子大學) in Tokyo (東京) marry? Among the earlier ones are Hwang Sin-dŏk (黃信德), Yi Hyŏn-gyŏng (李賢卿), Kim Pong-hŭi (金鳳姬), and a few others. Ms. Hwang Sin-dŏk married Mr. Im Pong-sun (任鳳淳), a Seoul-based fighter (鬪士) and reporter for the Tonga Ilbo (東亞日報). Ms. Yi Hyŏn-gyŏng worked as a female teacher in Suwŏn (水原) before becoming the wife of An Kwang-ch'ŏn (安光泉), who fled to Peiping (北平). Ms. Kim Pong-hŭi, while a professor at Ewha Girls' High School (梨花女高), married Mr. Hwang Ch'ŏng-song (黃淸頌), a high-ranking employee at Kyŏngsŏng Electric (京電). Ms. Sin Ŭi-gyŏng (辛義卿), who graduated from Tōhoku Imperial University (東北帝大) last year, is said to be married to a teacher at some university. And Cho Hyŏn-gyŏng (趙賢景), a Bachelor of Arts (文學士) who graduated from Kyushu Imperial University (九州帝大) and is currently at Ewha Specialized School (梨專), is still without a spouse ("해스"가 업스니 - has no husband), so she is excluded here.
What kind of husbands did the female doctors (女醫師) who graduated from Tokyo Women's Medical Specialized School (東京醫學專門) find? Dr. Hŏ Yŏng-suk (許英肅) became the wife of Mr. Yi Kwang-su (李光洙). Ms. Hyŏn Tŏk-sin (玄德信) went down to Kwangju (光州) and became the wife of Mr. Ch'oe Wŏn-sun (崔元淳), a former employee of the Tonga Ilbo (東亞日報). The heroic woman (女傑) Yu Yŏng-jun (劉英俊) married into a wealthy family (某富豪) in the Yŏngnam (嶺南) region. Ms. Kil Chŏng-hŭi (吉貞姬) became the wife of fellow doctor Kim T'ak-wŏn (金鐸遠), so both husband and wife handle forceps (핀셋트).
Ms. Ch'oe Ŭi-sun (崔義順), who attended Tokyo Women's Higher Normal School (東京女高師), was a female reporter for the Tonga Ilbo (東亞日報); lately, after parting ways with Mr. Chin Chang-sŏp (秦長燮), her current husband is unknown. Ms. Yun Sŏng-sang (尹聖相) is the wife of Mr. Chŏn Ho-jun (田鎬俊), an official at the Communications Bureau (遞信局). It's unclear if she attended Higher Normal School or Women's University, but Ms. Ch'oe Ŭn-hŭi (崔銀姬), after being widowed from her beloved ("愛人") Ubo (牛步) Min T'ae-wŏn (閔泰瑗), quietly raises her beloved child (愛兒) and passes the days. Also, it's not clear where Ms. Kim Mal-bong (金末峯) married.
Among the graduates of the Tokyo School of Fine Arts (東京美術學校) is Ms. Na Hye-sŏk (羅惠錫), but after passing through three generations <202> with Ch'oe Sŏk-wŏl (崔索月), Kim U-yŏng (金雨英), and Ch'oe Rin (崔麟), she now keeps a lonely vigil (孤閨). The husband of Pak Kyŏng-hŭi (朴慶姬) from Tokyo Music School (東京音樂) is the critic Yi Yŏ-sŏng (李如星). The husband of Kim Chŏng-hyŏn (金禎泃), also from Tokyo Music, is Mr. Ham Tae-hun (咸大勳) of Russian literature (露西亞文學). The female novelist (女流小說家) Pak Hwa-sŏng (朴花城), after finishing Sukmyung (淑明), attended Tokyo Women's University (東京女大); she married a professor at Tonghŭng Middle School (東興中學) in Kando (間島), a fighter (鬪士) in the social movement. Ms. Chŏn Yu-dŏk (田有德), who attended Tokyo Women's Specialized School (東京女專), became the wife of the novelist Ch'unhae (春海) Pang In-gŭn (方仁根). The wife of Mr. Sŏ Ch'un (徐椿) is also a graduate of Tokyo Women's Specialized School.
Ms. Han Ki-ju (韓琦柱) from Tokyo Ueno Music School (東京上野音樂) became the wife of the wealthy Mr. Paek Sang-gyu (白象奎). Ms. Chŏng Cha-yŏng (鄭子英) from Tokyo Medical Specialized School (東京醫專) also became the wife of a hospital director (病院長).
The late Yi Tŏk-yo (李德耀) was also a graduate of Tokyo Women's Specialized School and the wife of Han Wi-gŏn (韓偉健).
Among US university graduates, Ms. Cho *-gyŏng's (曺*卿) husband is Ch'oe Hwang (崔晃), a professor at Kyŏngsŏng Law College (廷專). The wife of Dr. Pak Hyŏng-nyong (朴亨龍) of P'yŏngyang Sungjŏn (平壤崇專) is a graduate of Peking University (北京大學).

Second Grade Class
Now let's examine the second-class seats. This refers to the "husbands" (男便), "boyfriends" (彼氏), and "lovers" (愛人) arrayed before the wives (令夫人) who are graduates of Girls' High Schools. The wife of the critic Kim Hwan-jae (金環載) is Sŏ Kyŏng-im (徐敬任), a graduate of Kyŏngsŏng Government Girls' High School (京城官立女高). The wife of Mr. Yang Kŭn-hwan (梁槿煥) graduated from P'yŏngyang Girls' School (平壤女學校) or somewhere similar. And the wife of Mr. Hong Yang-myŏng (洪陽明) is also a graduate of Kyŏngsŏng Girls' High School (京城女高). Chang Tŏk-cho (張德祚), a graduate of Paehwa Girls' High School (培花女高) who attended Ewha Specialized School (梨專) for a bit, married Pak Myŏng-hwan (朴明煥), who was a fighter (鬪士) in the Singanhoe movement (新幹運動). The dancer (舞踊家) Ms. Ch'oe Sŭng-hŭi (崔承喜) married Mr. An Mak (安漠), who attends Waseda University (早稻田大學). The wife of Mr. Yu Kwang-nyŏl (柳光烈) is a graduate of Kyŏngsŏng Government Girls' High School (京城官立女高). The wife of the novelist Mr. Kim Tong-in (金東仁) is also a graduate of P'yŏngyang Girls' High School (平壤女高). The wife of the poet Kim An-sŏ (金岸曙) is someone who worked as a female teacher in Chinnamp'o (鎭南浦) after graduating from Girls' High School. The wife of Mr. Chu Yo-han (朱耀翰) is also a Girls' High School graduate. The wife of Kim Tong-wŏn (金烔元) is also a graduate of Paehwa Girls' High School (培花女高).

Third Grade Class
We are surprised by the abundance of socially renowned figures (知名한 名士) in this class. The wife of Mr. Yŏ Un-hyŏng (呂運亨) can barely read the vernacular script (언문) section of the newspaper, but has no formal education (正規의 學歷). The wife of Mr. Kwŏn Tong-jin (權東鎭) of Ch'ŏndogyo (天道敎) also belongs here. Wait a moment. If I try to maintain decorum (體面) in this column (欄), I'll end up writing down only a few names. Let's muster our courage and reveal this "parade of honor" (名譽의 行進). The wife of Mr. Song Chin-u (宋鎭禹) is also at the vernacular script level. The wife of Sin Ch'ae-ho (申采浩), currently in Lushun Prison (旅順監獄), was only a nurse (看護婦). The wife of Mr. Pang Ŭng-mo (方應謨) is also at the vernacular script level. The late wife of Yi Tong-hwi (李東輝) was illiterate (目不識丁字). The wife of Yi Sŭng-man (李承晩) in North America (北美), if shown written characters, cannot distinguish fish (魚) from Lu (魯) [i.e., cannot read]. The wife of Son Chŏng-do (孫貞道) in Jilin (吉林) is also [illiterate, lit. "bean-soybean-kidney bean" (豆太콩팟)]. Kim Chwa-chin's (金佐鎭) wife can write letters in vernacular script. Kim Tong-sam's (金東三) wife is also not someone highly literate. The wife of Yu Tong-yŏl (劉東悅) is Yu Yŏng-hŭi (柳英姬), the elder sister of Ms. Yu Yŏng-jun (劉英俊); she understands refined tastes (風流) but not written characters (文字). As for Mr. Kim Pyŏng-no's (金炳魯) wife, even with vernacular script, there are more characters she doesn't know than she does. The wife of Kim Ku (金九) in Shanghai (上海) is also an "ignoramus" (無識쟁い). Mr. Wŏn Se-hun's (元世勳) wife served as a preacher's wife (傳道夫人), so she is of a higher grade than the wives of Yu Tong-yŏl and Kim Chwa-chin. The wife of Son Chŏng-do (孫貞道) in Jilin (吉林) also never entered the school gates. The wife of Mr. Yu Chin-t'ae (兪鎭泰) is someone for whom the era of being a rosy-cheeked beautiful girl student (紅顔美少女의 女學生 時代) was utterly non-existent (藥에 쓰재도 업던 분). The wife of Mr. Ch'oe Rin (崔麟) is also <203> at the vernacular script level. The wife of Mr. Hong Myŏng-hŭi (洪命憙) is also at the vernacular script level. Mr. Yi Chong-nin's (李鍾麟) wife, though her husband is a Hallim scholar (翰林學士), is leagues away (千里萬里) from being a scholar herself. As for Mr. Yun Ch'i-ho's (尹致昊) wife, Mrs. Ma (馬夫人) was highly learned (學識有餘), but his current wife belongs to the undiscounted illiterate class (割引업는 文盲階級). The wife of Dr. O Kŭng-sŏn (吳兢善), principal of Severance Medical College (세부란스 醫專校長), lacks education (學識) and is also quite advanced in age. The wife of Mr. Sin Hŭng-u (申興雨) also belongs to the class that uses ears more than eyes. The wives of Mr. Cho Man-sik (曺晩植), Mr. Kil Sŏn-chu (吉善宙), and Mr. Kim Tong-wŏn (金東元) are all comrades in "illiteracy" (文盲). Even the wife of Mr. Yu Ŏk-kyŏm (兪億兼), who is in a teaching position as the Vice Principal of Kyŏngsŏng Law College (廷專副校長), has knowledge of Chinese classics (漢學) but not modern learning (新學). The wife of Mr. Chŏng In-gwa (鄭仁果) is also an old-style wife (舊式夫人) and from the non-intellectual stratum (非智識層). Even for Mr. Kim Hang-gyu (金恒奎), his wife belongs to the vernacular-script-or-lower class. The wife of Mr. Sŏ Chŏng-hŭi (徐廷禧) is also someone who sits walled off from written characters (文字). The wife of Mr. Sŏl Ŭi-sik (薛義植) of the Tonga Ilbo (東亞日報) is also in a state of suspension (停止狀態) at the level of reading page three of the newspaper. The wife of Lyou Päk-rin (廬伯麟) in Shanghai (上海) doesn't know a mallet-shaped character (떡메丁字) from a bird-shaped character (새乙字) [i.e., is illiterate]. The wife of Dr. Yi Yong-sŏl (李容卨) is also at the "ige ya" character (익게 也字) level [basic literacy]. The wives of Mr. Kim Sŏng-su (金性洙) and Mr. An Chae-hong (安在鴻) are all stout-hearted individuals who live on without knowing letters. There are many others besides these (이박게도), but the reason for ending this "procession" (行列) here is that writing too much stirs up dust (몬지), and polishing too much breaks the window. This is due to the concern that if the "ignorance" (無識) in the "inner chambers" (內室) of the "great teachers" (大先生) of "Korean society" (朝鮮社會) were made public, they might furrow their brows (兩眉間을 쯩기실) in the "sorrow of revealing reality" (現實暴露의 悲哀). <204>

**Summary**

This 1935 article from the magazine *Samch'ŏlli* categorizes the wives of prominent Korean men into three "academic ranks": Special Grade (university/specialized school graduates), Second Grade (girls' high school graduates), and Third Grade (elementary level or illiterate). It then proceeds to name numerous well-known figures (politicians, activists, intellectuals, artists, doctors, businessmen) and explicitly state their wives' educational background, placing them within these grades. The author uses blunt, sometimes derogatory language ("ignoramus," "human wreck," "illiterate") particularly for the Third Grade, while acknowledging the large number of famous men married to women with little or no formal modern education.

For historians, the article offers a fascinating, if biased, snapshot of social attitudes towards women's education and status within the Korean elite during the colonial period. The explicit ranking and naming of individuals reveal contemporary social hierarchies and judgments based on education. It highlights the relatively recent advent of higher education for women, the varying educational levels even among the wives of the most prominent men, and provides specific data points about the personal lives (or at least perceived educational status of spouses) of major historical figures, including independence movement leaders, cultural icons, and educators. The candid, judgmental tone itself is a significant artifact of the era's social discourse.

令夫人學力等級記
令夫人에 三等級잇다 「훌융한 녀편네를 가지지마라. 그 지아비 된 자 한평생 설음일네라」
이것을 만일 漢文式으로 번역한다면 「勿爲 有名 女性之夫兮」
라고나할가 긔왕이면 李太白가튼 名文章이 한마듸 던지고 죽엇던들 萬古에 「妻侍下」 「妻后立」의 數萬君子에 「自慰감이」되련만, 아모커나 「아모개 남편」이라면 알고 아모개라면 모르게 사내년석이 세상에 태여낫다가 그늘에 핀 꼿가치 녀편네 德分에 시들어감은 그리 유쾌한 일이 아닌 것이다. 그러나 도리켜 생각하면 저, 기억자도 모르는 「인간망난이」 녀편네를 안해로 가지기 보다는 나으리라, 좌우간 오늘날 우리사회의 제일선에 서서 활동하는 「紳士」로서 그 夫人을 엇던 분을 가지고 잇는가, 이제 그 令夫人의 學力을 考思하야 三等級을 定하여 노코 이 틀속에 잠간 실례지만 「紳士淑女」를 모다 집어 너허 보기로 할거나,
特等階級은 大學出身이나 專門學校出身의＜201＞ 울트라, 인테리 女性을 녀편네로 가진 분
二等階級은 女子高普을 마친 「인테리」를 안해로 가진 분
三等階級은 普通學校 又는 幼稚園 또는 아조 初步의 十個月胎敎程度에 끗친-말하자면 좀 실례지만 「無識쟁이」를 안해로 가진 분

特等階級
그러면 이제부터 눈을 질끈감고 命名式을 거행하기로 하지요. 女子大學이라면 朝鮮에도 梨花學堂이 女子大學인 적이 잇섯다. 그때 卒業生에 金弼愛 라고 人物 잘나고 英語 잘하는 才媛이 잇섯다. 이분은 그뒤 北京가서 北洋 大學敎授로 잇든 有名한 金奎植博士의 안해가 되엿다. 金弼愛란 지금 光州某女學校에 가 잇는 金弼禮 氏의 언니다.
그리고 梨花大學에는 朴仁德, 金活蘭, 尹聖德 等 여러분이 잇섯으나, 種種의 이유로 「미쓰」대로 그냥 잇스니, 여긔 쓸맛이 업다. 北京말이 낫스니 金元鳳의 안해는 朴次貞이라하야 華北大學도 다녓고 서울 드러와 槿友會 의 幹部로도 잇든 분이다.
그리고 이미 도라갓으나 北京 崔昌植 의 夫人 金元慶 氏는 京城官立女高를 마첫슬 뿐이나, 海外遊歷에 그 智識이 大學出身以上이엿다 함이 定評이엿다. 北米 徐載弼 博士夫人은 로스앤젤스 어느 大學出身의 金髮美人임은 넘우 아는 이가 만흐리라.
東京잇는 目白女子大學出身들은 엇던 사내들한테 시집을 갓는고. 몬저 나온 이가 黃信德, 李賢卿, 金鳳姬等 서너분잇다. 黃信德씨는 서울系 鬪士요 東亞日報記者인 任鳳淳氏 품에 시집갓고 李賢卿씨는 水原서 女敎員 노릇하다가 北平에 逃走한 安光泉 의 안해가 되엿섯고 金鳳姬씨는 梨花女高敎授로 잇스면서 京電高級社員 黃淸頌 씨에게 出嫁하엿다. 昨年엔가 東北帝大를 마춘 辛義卿 女史의 남편은 어느 大學校의 敎師라하며 그리고 九州帝大를 나와서 현재 梨專에 잇는 趙賢景文學士는 아직 「해스」가 업스니 여기서는 제외한다.
東京醫學專門出身의 女醫師들은 엇던 남편을 어더 사시는고 許英肅 女史는 李光洙 씨의 안해가 되엇고 玄德信 씨는 光州내려가서 녯 東亞日報社員 崔元淳 씨의 마누라가 되엇고 女傑 劉英俊씨는 嶺南某富豪의게 시집갓다. 吉貞姬 씨는 가튼 醫師 金鐸遠씨의 夫人이 되여 內外가 다 핀셋트를 만지고 잇다.
東京女高師를 다니든 崔義順 씨는 東亞日報女記者로 잇더니 요지음은 秦長燮씨와 갈나진 뒤는 그 남편을 모르겟고, 尹聖相 씨는 遞信局官吏 田鎬俊 씨의 안해가 되어잇다. 高師인지 女大出인지 몰으나 崔銀姬씨는 愛人 牛步 閔泰瑗 씨를 死別하고 고요히 愛兒을 기르며 날을 보내고 잇고 또 金末峯 씨는 어데 시집갓는지 잘 몰으겟다.
東京美術學校出身으로는 羅惠錫 씨가 잇스나 崔索月, 金雨英 , 崔麟 씨등 三代를＜202＞ 거처 지금은 孤閨를 직히며 東京音樂의 朴慶姬씨 남편은 評論家 李如星씨요 가튼 東京音樂의 金禎泃 씨는 露西亞文學의 咸大勳氏 夫人이다. 女流小說家 朴花城氏는 淑明 마친 뒤 東京女大를 다니든 분인데 社會運動의 鬪士인 間島東興中學敎授에게 시집갓고, 東京女專 단이든 田有德 氏는 小說家 春海 方仁根 씨의 안해가 되엿다. 徐椿 氏 夫人도 東京女專出身이며

二等階級
이제는 二等席을 살펴보자. 二等席이란 女高出身程度의 令夫人압해 陣列된 「男便」과 「彼氏」와 「愛人」들을 가르침이다. 評論家 金環載 氏 마누라가 京城官立女高出身의 徐敬任 씨요 梁槿煥 씨의 안해는 平壤女學校인가 어덴가 마춘이다. 그리고 洪陽明 氏 마누라도 京城女高出身이요, 培花女高出身으로 梨專에 좀 단이든 張德祚 氏는 新幹運動의 鬪士이든 朴明煥 한테 시집갓고, 舞踊家 崔承喜 女史는 早稻田大學에 단이는 安漠 氏에로 시집갓고, 柳光烈 氏 夫人은 京城官立女高出身이요, 小說家 金東仁 氏 夫人도 平壤女高出身이요 詩人 金岸曙 의 夫人도 女高나온 뒤 鎭南浦서 女敎員 하든 분이요 朱耀翰 氏 夫人도 女高出身이오 金烔元 夫人도 培花女高出身이다.

三等階級
우리는 이 階級에 사회에 知名한 名士가 만흠에 놀낸다. 呂運亨 氏 夫人도 비록 新聞의 언문난은 겨우 보지만 正規의 學歷은 업는 분 天道敎의 權東鎭 氏 夫人도 여기에 해당한 분이다. 가만잇자. 이 欄에 와서 體面차리다가는 몃 사람 못적고 만다. 勇氣를 내어 이 「名譽의 行進」을 들추기로 하자. 宋鎭禹 氏 夫人도 언문 정도, 旅順監獄에 잇는 申采浩 夫人도 看護婦出身일뿐, 方應謨 氏 夫人도 언문정도, 目前, 도라간 李東輝 夫人도 目不識丁字, 北米李承晩 夫人도 글자를 써보이면 魚, 魯不辨, 吉林 孫貞道 夫人도 「豆太콩팟」, 金佐鎭 夫人은 언문 편지는 쓰며, 金東三 夫人도 그리 대단한 글는 분은 아니다. 劉東悅 夫人은 劉英俊 氏 兄인 柳英姬氏로 風流는 解하지만 文字은 不解요 金炳魯 氏 夫人은 언문조차 아는 字보다 모르는 字가 더 만코, 上海 金九 夫人 亦 無識쟁이다. 元世勳 氏 夫人은 傳道夫人이라도 지냇으니 柳東悅 , 金佐鎭 階級보다는 고급이다. 吉林 孫貞道 夫人도 學校門을 출입못한 분이요 兪鎭泰 氏 夫人도 紅顔美少女의 女學生 時代라고 藥에 쓰재도 업던 분이요 崔麟 氏 夫人도＜203＞ 언문 정도, 洪命憙 氏 夫人도 언문 정도며 李鍾麟 氏 夫人은 남편은 翰林學士인데 부인은 학사와는 千里萬里의 거리가 잇는 분, 尹致昊 氏 夫人은 馬夫人은 學識有餘하엿으나 現夫人은 割引업는 文盲階級 세부란스 醫專校長 吳兢善 氏 夫人은 學識업는데다가 年齡도 심히 만흔 분 申興 雨 氏 夫人도 눈보다 귀를 쓰는 階級, 曺晩植 氏 夫人도 吉善宙 氏 夫人도 金東元 氏 夫人도 모다 모다 「文盲」의 동지들이다. 廷專副 校長이라면 가르키는 지위에 잇는 兪億兼 氏 夫人도 漢學은 잇으나 新學은 업는 분 鄭仁果 氏 夫人도 舊式夫人이자 非智識層이다. 金恒奎 氏인들 亦 그 夫人은 언문이하의 階級, 徐廷禧 氏 夫人도 文字와는 담막코 안즌 분이요, 東亞日報의 薛義植 氏 夫人도 新聞三面읽는 정도에서 停止狀態에 잇고 上海 廬伯麟 夫人도 떡메丁字도 새 乙字도 모르는 이다. 李容卨 博士 夫人도 익게 也字程度며 金性洙 氏 夫人 安在鴻 氏 夫人 모다 글 모르고도 사러간다는 뱃심조흔 분들이다. 이박게도 여러분이 잇스나 이 「行列」을 이 정도에서 끈치기로 하는 까닭은 너무 쓰면 몬지가 나고 너무 닥그면 창이 빠지는지라 「朝鮮社會」의 「大先生」께서 「內室」의 「無識」이 公表된다면 그 「現實暴露의 悲哀」에 兩眉間을 쯩기실 근심이 잇슴으로써이다.＜204＞
