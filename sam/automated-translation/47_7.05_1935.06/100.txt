Platforms of Various Political Parties

Platform of the Rikken Seiyūkai (立憲政友會)
We, comrades, establish the Rikken Seiyūkai and strive to fulfill our duties as subjects to the state by serving the Imperial Household (皇室) with loyalty. The main points of our purpose are as follows:
One. We comrades shall strictly observe the Constitution, follow its articles and chapters, and make the complete application of sovereign power (統治權) the essential duty of the state, thereby ensuring the preservation of individual rights and freedoms.
One. We comrades shall adhere to the grand plan of the Meiji Restoration and Revival (維新中興), support and assist this, advance the destiny of the nation, and endeavor to foster civilization.
One. We comrades hope to perfect the functions of administration and ensure its impartiality, striving for precision in selection and appointment, simplification of complex procedures, clarification of responsibilities, strictness in discipline, and agility in handling matters, thereby planning to keep pace with the progress of the times.
One. We comrades shall emphasize diplomacy, deepen friendships with friendly nations (友邦), put distant peoples at ease through civilized governance, and strive to perfect the name and reality of a constitutional state.
One. We comrades deem it necessary to achieve complete national defense in response to internal and external circumstances, hoping to always perfect the protection of national rights and interests in parallel with the development of national strength.
One. We comrades hope to promote education, cultivate the character of the people, develop the virtues and abilities for public and private individuals to share the burdens of the state, thereby solidifying the foundations of the nation.
One. We comrades desire to encourage agriculture, commerce, and all industries, make navigation and trade flourish, increase the convenience of transportation, thereby enabling the state to solidify the foundation for economic survival.
One. We comrades shall implement local autonomy, bring about the reality of neighborly unity and solidarity, and plan to perfect social and economic cooperation therein.
One. We comrades shall take seriously our responsibilities to the state, act for the public good, constantly exercise self-restraint, and ensure that we do not fall into entrenched bad habits (宿弊).

Platform of the Rikken Minseitō (立憲民政黨)
One. Based on the essence of the national polity (國體), conduct politics centered on the Diet representing the collective will of the people, founded on the principle of centering on the Imperial Household (皇室).
One. Diplomacy shall be based on the principle of national diplomacy grounded in international justice, and accordingly, insist that the resolution of issues such as commerce, economy, land, and resources be based on the concept of justice.
One. Economically, plan for the rational increase of production, ensure fairness in distribution, and establish the foundation of a national economy that eliminates the insecurity of the working classes in cities and rural villages.
One. Education shall implement practical education that cultivates character, fosters an original spirit, establishes a policy of cherishing truth, plans for equal educational opportunities, and links schools with society.

Shintō Kurabu (新黨俱樂部) <79>
One. Has not announced a platform or policies.

Platform of the Jitsugyō Dōshikai (實業同志會)
One. To promote the self-awareness of the people and ensure the establishment of pure constitutional politics.
One. To eliminate all petitions and movements seeking state protection that disregard the public interest, thereby tightening discipline (綱紀).
One. To promote industry and thereby solidify the foundations of the state.
One. To organize finance and administration and thereby lighten the burden on the people.
One. To implement appropriate social policies and thereby stabilize the minds of the people.

Platform of the Kakushintō (革新黨)
One. Expand the powers of the Diet, specifically the House of Representatives, and reduce the powers of the House of Peers. The unfairness, akin to a group of peers (華族) who have rights in both houses due to high tax payments practically monopolizing one house of the legislature, must be remedied, even if it requires amending the Imperial Constitution. It is necessary to enact separate constitutions for Chosŏn (朝鮮) and T'aiwan (臺灣).
Two. Elections: Although the Universal Suffrage Law (普選法) has been established, the electoral system is still incomplete (regarding points such as disqualification clauses, gender and age requirements, security deposits, campaign expenses, and election methods). Further revision is necessary.
Three. Education: Break down uniformity, strive to harmonize life and education, endeavor to dismantle conventional prejudices. National treasury shall bear the full cost of compulsory education expenses. Treat public and private schools equally.
Four. National Defense: Reduce military armaments to the minimum necessary for national defense and adopt a system where military ministers can be civilians (文部制 - *Translator's note: This likely refers to 文官任用制, civilian appointment system, not the Ministry of Education*).
Five. Labor: Establish labor rights and tenant farming rights (小作權), lower the cost of living, and complete various facilities related to poverty prevention and relief. Appoint a minister with special responsibility for these matters.
Six. Administrative Reorganization: Carry out a major reorganization of the administration (e.g., merging the Army and Navy Ministries, merging the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways, abolishing the Ministry of Justice and the General Staff Headquarters).
Seven. Taxation: The principle shall be to increase the burden on the propertied classes while reducing the burden on the propertyless classes. Implement revisions to the tax system for burden equilibrium. Reduce or abolish customs duties and consumption taxes.
Eight. Local Autonomy: Elect local governors publicly, expand autonomy rights, and plan for the enhancement of local finances.
Nine. Emigration/Colonization (移植民): Provide appropriate facilities (education, sanitation, finance, etc.) with national funds in settlement areas/colonies (移植民地).

Platform of the Nihon Nōmintō (日本農民黨)
One. We are the working class. We reject political domination by the privileged classes and aim to realize social justice, the common ideal of the entire working class.
One. We are Japanese. Based on the reality of Japan's unique national circumstances (國情), we strive for the stability and improvement of national life by planning for the promotion of industry and fairness of distribution, and take as our mission the expression of our pure Japanese essence and the just and great Japanese people.
One. Reform of Parliamentary Politics. Regarding parliamentary policy, we reject all irrational and unnatural systems, organizations, and customs, and aim for the construction of a rational new society.
One. Establishment of Rural Culture. We reject the unhealthy urban-centric culture and aim for the completion of a sound, local new culture. <80>

**Summary**

This 1935 article from the magazine *Samch'ŏlli* outlines the political platforms of several contemporary Japanese political parties: Rikken Seiyūkai, Rikken Minseitō, Jitsugyō Dōshikai, Kakushintō, and Nihon Nōmintō (The Shintō Kurabu had not yet announced one). The platforms cover a range of issues including constitutionalism, loyalty to the Emperor, foreign policy, economic development (industry, agriculture, trade), administrative reform, national defense, education, social welfare, labor rights, and local autonomy. The Kakushintō's platform is particularly notable for advocating separate constitutions for the colonies of Chosŏn (Korea) and T'aiwan (Taiwan), expanding suffrage, reducing military power (including civilian control), and significant administrative/tax reforms targeting inequality. The Nihon Nōmintō focuses on representing the working/farming class against privileged classes and promoting a distinct rural culture.

For historians studying Korean colonial history, this article is valuable as it provides a snapshot of the political discourse in Japan that directly or indirectly impacted colonial policies. The explicit mention by the Kakushintō of enacting separate constitutions for Korea and Taiwan is highly significant, suggesting internal Japanese debate, however marginal, about the legal and political status of the colonies. The general focus of most parties on national strength, economic development, and social stability also provides context for the prevailing ideologies influencing colonial administration, while the farmer and labor-focused parties highlight social tensions within the Japanese empire itself.
