Article Type: 소식 (News/Announcement)

There are many schools in Chosŏn (朝鮮), and medical colleges (醫專) are sparsely located. However, this is the first time there has been something called an Electro-medical School (電醫學校). One should not misunderstand what an Electro-medical School is. The Electro-medical School is a school that teaches medicine exclusively, just like a general medical college (醫學專門學校). As a method of electrotherapy (雷氣治療法) demanded by the modern era (現代), when malfunctions occur in the mysterious functions of life within the human body (人體), which absolutely cannot be cured solely by medicine (藥), electro-medicine (電醫學) provides the happiness of a complete cure (完治) to patients with difficult-to-treat diseases (難疾) through its five great actions (5大 作用): physical action (物理的 作用), chemical action (化學的 作用), physiological action (生理的 作用), bactericidal action (殺菌的 作用), and stimulatory action (動念的 作用). This is a sacred enterprise (聖業). The principal, Mr. Ōshige Chika (大重近氏), truly has much experience (經驗) regarding electro-medicine; having served as the principal of the Tōkyō Electro-medical School (東京電醫專門學校校長) and established branch schools (分校) as far away as Ōsaka (大阪) and Taiwan (臺灣), educating many talented individuals (英材), he has now come to P'yŏngyang (平壤) to establish a branch school and is teaching at the school which will guide the future of young people well (善히 指導).

**Summary**

This article announces the establishment of the P'yŏngyang Electro-medical School (平壤電醫校), presented as a modern institution meeting the demands of the era. It highlights electrotherapy (雷氣治療法) as a superior method for treating difficult diseases incurable by conventional medicine, citing its "five great actions." The school is a branch established by Mr. Ōshige Chika (大重近), who previously ran similar schools in Tōkyō, Ōsaka, and Taiwan. The piece promotes the school as accessible ("anyone can learn") and beneficial for the future of Korean youth. For historians, this article illustrates the introduction and promotion of Japanese-led technological and educational ventures (here, a specific type of medical training, electrotherapy) in colonial Korea. It reflects the narrative of modernization under Japanese influence, the appeal to scientific advancement (even if pseudo-scientific by modern standards), and the targeting of Korean youth for new forms of education and professions within the colonial structure.
