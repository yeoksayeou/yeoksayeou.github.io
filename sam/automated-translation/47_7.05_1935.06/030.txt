Son Pyŏnghŭi, Leader of Two Million Believers
						Kwŏn Tongjin

One.

The golden age in the modern history of Ch'ŏndogyo was during the time Son Uiam was alive, and at that time, I had the most comrades around me who shared the same aspirations.
Also, the Ch'ŏndogyo congregation adhering to the *Innaech'ŏn* principle (Man is Heaven) was most numerous then, so that the actual number of believers across all of Chosŏn who observed the *Sŏngmi* (Sincerity Rice offering) and precepts reached two million.
Son Uiam was the sun of Ch'ŏndogyo.
When he stood, Ch'ŏndogyo stood rightly, and when he led, the minds and bodies of two million were aligned as one, orderly without the slightest disarray.
He was our savior. If we sought a model teacher for all ages, we could only go before him<40> and bow our heads. So, if one asks what was outstanding about Teacher Son Pyŏnghŭi as a leader? Firstly, one must mention his integrity. Before joining Ch'ŏndogyo around the age of twenty, he was merely an idler who had not found his purpose, easily falling into the pitiful state of drunken revelry. However, once he encountered the Ch'ŏndogyo truth of *Kwangje Ch'angsaeng Poguk Anmin* (Broadly save the multitude, Protect the nation and secure the people) and devoted himself to it, his mindset transformed. His once rough lifestyle changed completely; he closed his doors, knelt on his seat, and according to the cultivation procedures of Tonghak, focused entirely on *Susim Chŏnggi* (Preserving the mind and rectifying the spirit). Thereafter, he sometimes fought against the lawless official power of Old Korea, and in the great battle of Kabo (1894), he stood amidst arrows and stones as a friend of the people. Times turned unfavorable, and he went into exile in Tokyo, enduring wandering and upheaval, his hardships extreme. Yet, he never abandoned, even for a moment, his earnest single-minded devotion to saving lives, dedicating his life and heart's blood solely in anticipation of the Great Work. Seeing the whole world mourn upon his passing, one can feel that his integrity shines with the sun and moon.
Moreover, he was magnanimous and audacious—truly an elder who possessed all the great qualities of a leader, indeed one of the giants Chosŏn possessed in modern times.
There was an incident like this once. A general meeting was held, but there was no place to accommodate the several thousand representatives who came up from the thirteen provinces, so the meeting place was unavoidably set at Ch'wiunjŏng Pavilion.
Uiam lamented this, saying,
"For our Ch'ŏndogyo, with two million members, to hold a general meeting at someone else's house is a great shame. So, regardless of anything else, let's build a building."<41>
Thus, he had plans drawn up by key figures and conveyed his words to his trusted confidants. A decision was made right then to raise 200,000 wŏn and build a Grand Hall, and immediately thereafter, Sangch'unwŏn Park outside the East Gate was purchased for 50,000 wŏn. Was that all? He directly managed Posŏng College, operated Posŏng Middle School, and ran the Pomun'gwan publishing house, among other things; his enterprises spread across the entire face of society. Truly, the golden age points to this time in Ch'ŏndogyo history.

Two.

Listing the workers under the leader Son Uiam at that time:
Pak Inho
O Sech'ang
O Yŏngch'ang
Na Yonghwan
Chŏng Kwangjo
Yi Chongnin
Ch'oe Rin
O Sangjun
Yi Tonhwa
Hong Pyŏnghŭi
And lastly, Kwŏn Tongjin. Among them, the comrades who undertook key tasks within the organizational structure of the religion included O Yŏngch'ang as Director of Finance (金融觀長), O Sech'ang as Director of the Central Bureau (玄機觀長), Na Yonghwan in accounting (經理), and this person [the author] in propagation (布德). Generally speaking, throughout Uiam's lifetime, he placed the greatest trust in Mr. O Yŏngch'ang and Mr. Na Yonghwan regarding the finances and administration of the religion. For general social issues, he trusted Mr. O Sech'ang and, although it may be presumptuous of me to say, this writer, entrusting us with matters great and small.
At that time, all of us comrades were united in heart, all had integrity, and our spirit was grand. We maintained order and strove to move together with the general trend of Chosŏn.
Then, when the events of the Kiminyŏn year (1919) broke out, following Uiam's words, we entrusted the aftermath entirely to one of our comrades, Mr. O Yŏngch'ang. He alone remained and magnificently completed the great construction of the Ch'ŏndogyo Grand Hall, which had only been planned.

Three.<42>

We still often think about it now. Capable individuals gathered evenly, and as they gathered, the congregation covered 30 provinces [likely an error, should be 13 provinces], its actual number truly exceeding 2 million. If each of the 2 million were made to contribute a fee of 10 chŏn each, wouldn't that be 200,000 wŏn? If they contributed 50 chŏn each, wouldn't that be 1 million wŏn? At that time, the finances were also abundant and plentiful.
This leader, these comrades, this multitude, this era! As my brush reaches this point, my heart feels constricted, and the brush handle will not move further.
However, I firmly believe that the golden age of Ch'ŏndogyo will not be something that flashes by like lightning just once in history, and with this belief, I cast down my brush.<43>
<40-43>

**Summary**

This memoir by Kwŏn Tongjin, a key figure in Ch'ŏndogyo, reflects on the religion's "golden age" under the leadership of Son Pyŏnghŭi (Uiam). Kwŏn praises Son's integrity, vision, and leadership, crediting him with unifying two million believers and expanding the organization's influence through educational institutions (Posŏng College, Posŏng Middle School), publishing (Pomun'gwan), and the construction of a grand headquarters. The author lists prominent fellow leaders and emphasizes their unity and dedication during this peak period, contrasting it implicitly with the state of affairs in 1935. He concludes with a sense of loss for that era but expresses hope for Ch'ŏndogyo's future resurgence.

From a historical perspective, the article offers valuable insights into the organizational strength, financial capacity, and nationalistic aspirations of Ch'ŏndogyo in the pre-1919 period. Kwŏn's account highlights Son Pyŏnghŭi's pivotal role not just as a religious leader but as a significant socio-political figure mobilizing a large segment of the Korean population. The mention of specific projects like the headquarters construction and school management, along with the naming of key personnel and their roles, provides concrete details about the movement's structure and activities. The reference to the March 1st Movement (Kiminyŏn Sa) and the subsequent entrustment of affairs to O Yŏngch'ang further contextualizes Ch'ŏndogyo's involvement in nationalist endeavors during the colonial period. Historians might find the claimed figure of two million adherents and the described financial potential particularly interesting for understanding the scale and potential influence of non-governmental Korean organizations under Japanese rule.

二百萬 敎徒의 統率者 孫秉熙
						權東鎭
一.
天道敎의 近世史上 全盛時代는 孫義菴在世 때며 그때에 나의 신변에는 뜻을 가치하든 同志가 가장 만햇슴니다.
또한 人乃天主義에 歸一하는 天道敎衆이 가장 만하여서 實로 誠米와 戒律을 직히는 교도가 全朝鮮에 實數 二百萬을 헤여젓슴니다.
孫義菴은 天道敎의 太陽이엇슴니다.
그가 서매 天道敎가 바로 섯고 그가 統率하매 二百萬의 心身이 한글가치 一糸不亂 整齊하엿섯슴니다.
그는 우리의 救主엿지요. 萬代의 師表을 구하자면 우리들은 오르지 그의＜40＞ 압헤 나아가 오직 머리를 숙임이 잇섯슬뿐임니다. 그러면 孫秉熙선생은 統率者로서 무엇이 뛰어낫든고? 하고 뭇는다면 첫재 그의 志操를 들지니, 이십세 전후하야 天道敎에 들기 전엔 한갓 뜻을 엇지 못한 逸民이 되야 酣嬉淋漓의 悲態에 빠지기 쉬엇스나, 一旦 廣濟蒼生 保國安民의 天道敎 眞理에 接하야 그에 投身하자 그 心機는 轉하엿스며 粗放하든 생활은 一變하야 門을 閉하고 席에 跪하야 東學의 修道節次에 依하야 守心正氣에 專力하엿고 以后 或은 舊韓國의 無道한 官權과 싸우고 甲午의 큰 싸홈에는 人民의 벗이 되야 矢石의 사이에 섯섯스며 時 不利하야 東京에 亡命하든 둥 流離顚沛 그 辛苦 至極하엿스나 拳拳한 濟生의 一念을 邊時라도 버림이 업시 오직 大事를 期하야 一生을 心血을 다하엿스니 그가 一旦에 도라가자 擧世哀悼함을 보아도 그의 志操與日月輝함을 늣길 수 잇슴니다.
그러고 寬厚하고 大膽하고-實로 人之長이 가지는 모든 偉大한 點을 다 具備한 어룬이니 실로 近世에 조선이 가진 巨人 중 한 분이심니다.
언젠가 이런 일이 잇섯슴니다. 대회가 잇서 그때 十三道로부터 올나온 數千名 代表을 마지할 곳이 업시 대회장을 不得已 翠雲亭에 定하엿지요.
義菴께서 이를 慨嘆하시다가
「二百萬을 가진 우리 天道敎로서, 남의 집에서 大會를 연다함은 크 羞恥니 자 不係萬事하고 집을 지읍시다.」＜41＞
이리하야 要路에 設計식히고 腹心에 말슴을 傳하야, 그때 당장 20만원을 거처 大會堂을 짓기로 決定하고 금방 그 길로 동대문 박게 잇는 常春園을 5만원에 삿습니다. 그뿐임니까. 普成專門學校를 直營하고 普成中學校를 經營하엿스며 普文舘을 하는 등 그 事業이 社會 全面에 뻐치엇슴니다. 실로 全盛時代는 天道敎史 중 이때를 가르칠 것이외다.

二.

그 當時 首領 孫義菴 아래 잇든 일꾼들을 들자면
朴寅浩
吳世昌
吳榮昌
羅龍煥
鄭廣朝
李鍾麟
崔  麟
吳尙俊
李敦化
洪秉熙
그리고 末尾에 權東鎭 이 사람들이엇슴니다. 그 중에도 敎의 組織體內의 主要任務를 마튼 同志로서는 金融觀長으로 잇든 吳榮昌군 玄機觀長으로 잇든 吳世昌군 經理의 羅龍煥 布德의 이 사람 등이엇는데 대체로 말하면 義菴在世時는 一代를 通하야. 敎內의 財政과 行政 등에 對하여는 吳榮昌 羅龍煥의 두 분을 가장 몹시 信任하섯고 一般의 社會的 問題에 對하여는 吳世昌군과 이 글을 쓰는 畏濫하나마 이 사람을 信任하여 大小事를 一任하여 주더이다.
그때의 우리들 同志는 모다 合心하엿고 모다 志操가 잇섯고 氣像이 雄大하엿슴니다. 秩序를 차렷고 朝鮮의 大勢에 가치 움지기를 힘썻지요.
그리다가 己未年事가 터지자 우리들은 義菴의 말슴대로 後事를 同志의 一人인 吳榮昌군게 一任하엿는데 設計만하고 말엇든 天道敎 大會堂의 大工事를 氏가 오직 혼자 남어서 훌융하게 完成식혀 노앗든 터이외다.

三.＜42＞

우리는 지금도 늘 생각하고 잇슴니다. 人物이 고르게 모이고 고르게 모앗스매, 그에 따라 敎衆이 30道를 덥헛스니 그 실數가 實로 200만을 넘엇슴니다. 200만에게 每人 10錢식 그 會費를 辨出식힌다면 20만원이 아님니까. 50錢式 辨出식힌다면 100만원이 아님니까. 그때는 財政도 裕하고 豐하엿슴니다.
이 首領, 이 同志, 이 群衆, 이 時代! 여기까지 붓이 미치매 가슴이 막혀 더 붓자루가 나가지 안슴니다.
그러나 天道敎의 全盛時代란 歷史上으로 한 번을 번개가치 휙 지나고 말 것이 아닐 줄 確信하며 이 붓을 던짐니다.＜43＞
＜40-43＞
