Memoir of Sunjong's Royal Study Companions,
						Ch'angnang'gaek

Emperor Sunjong spent 33 years as Crown Prince (世子宮). Born in the year Kapsul (1874), he was invested as Crown Prince (東宮) the following year, Ŭrhae (1875), and remained so until the year Chŏngmi (1907), which was Meiji 41. Ascending the throne the year after, reaching Yunghŭi 1 (1907), the period he spent as Crown Prince was indeed a long time of over thirty years.

Therefore, the question of what kind of education Emperor Sunjong received during this Crown Prince period is truly a matter that draws attention. Originally, in the Royal Palace, a special education called "Imperial Studies" (帝王學) was provided for the adult who would eventually ascend the throne. Looking at the example of present-day Tokyo, there was an institution called the "Gakushūin" (學習院), where previously General Nogi (乃木大將) served as principal, educating the children and nephews of the royal family and high-ranking ministers and officials. At that time on the Peninsula (半島), however, there was no Royal/Princely educational institution similar to the Gakushūin system. Instead, for the Crown Prince, an institution called the "Ch'ungyebang" (春桂坊), later the "Seja Sigangwŏn" (世子侍講院), was established within the Grand Palace (大闕). What was the organization of the "Ch'ungyebang" at that time? Originally, during the Ming Dynasty (明朝), there was the "Ch'unbang" (春坊) <34> as the place of learning for the Crown Prince. Korea (朝鮮) also modeled itself after this, establishing a "Ch'unbang" in the palace since the Three Kingdoms period. During the Yi Dynasty (李朝), a special 'bang' (坊) called "Kyebang" (桂坊) was added. It is said that the Ch'unbang was the educational center for literary studies (文科), and the Kyebang was the educational center for military studies (武科). Later, the two were combined and called "Ch'ungyebang," becoming the place where all aspects of Imperial Studies, both civil and military, were taught.

The name Ch'ungyebang was later changed, in a new style, to "Seja Sigangwŏn." The Kyŏngguk Taejŏn (經國大典 - National Code) states:
Seja Sigangwŏn (世子侍講院)
Oversees lecturing on Classics (經)
And History (史), guiding and admonishing in Path (道)
And Righteousness (義), also using Civil (文)
Officials (官) as Associate Tutors (副賓客)
Furthermore, regarding the instructors (敎官) who educated the Crown Prince, the list includes:
Above posts filled by officials holding other concurrent positions <35>
Senior 1st Rank: One Master (師), concurrently held by the Chief State Councilor (領議政).

One Transmitter (傅), concurrently held by the Left State Councilor (左議政).

Junior 1st Rank: One Second Master (貳師), concurrently held by a Deputy State Councilor (贊成).

Senior 2nd Rank: Left and Right Tutors (左右賓客), one each.

Junior 2nd Rank: Left and Right Associate Tutors (左右副賓客), one each.

Junior 3rd Rank: One Counselor (輔德), concurrent post.

Senior 4th Rank: One Mentor (弼善), concurrent post.

Senior 5th Rank: One Expositor (文學), concurrent post.

Senior 6th Rank: One Recorder (司書), concurrent post.

Senior 7th Rank: One Lector (說書), concurrent post.

High Rank (堂上): One Admonitor (贊善), from the 'Mountain Forest' scholars (山林).

Low Rank (堂下): One Cultivator (進善).

Thus, for the education of the Crown Prince, the Chief State Councilor, who was the Prime Minister of the time, and other cabinet ministers all held positions in that educational institution. Furthermore, renowned Confucian scholars (名儒) revered by the nation, known as "Sallim" (山林), meaning scholars skilled in Classical Chinese, also took charge of these duties.

Min Pyŏngsŏk, Yi Chaekon, etc.
Were the aforementioned various officials of the Seja Sigangwŏn appointed from above? It was not so; rather, they were selected from below, recommended, and then received confirmation. <36>
In any case, after the organization of the Seja Sigangwŏn was completed, specific dates were set each month for the Crown Prince to come to the study hall within the Grand Palace. There, scholars like the Chief State Councilor or the "Sallim" would teach the Four Books and Five Classics (四書五經), and sometimes calligraphy (書) and painting (畵). The Seja Sigangwŏn was always located within the Grand Palace, so even looking at recent examples, it was sometimes within Kyŏngbok Palace (景福宮), and sometimes within Tŏksu Palace (德壽宮闕).
However, the Crown Prince did not sit and study alone in the study hall; there were Royal Study Companions (御學友). He learned alongside youths of the same age, sharing desks (冊床), and engaged in exercise or games shoulder-to-shoulder. Who, then, were these Royal Study Companions who shared desks and read together, and played games shoulder-to-shoulder at that time? If we try to enumerate the Royal Study Companions during the 33 years of the Crown Prince period, there are indeed very many, but those currently living are believed to be generally as follows:
Viscount Min Yŏnghwi (閔泳徽氏) - This person later held many official posts such as Governor of P'yŏngyang (平壤監司), and is now managing Hwimun High Common School (徽文高普). He passed the civil service examination (文科及第) in his youth.
Min Pyŏngsŏk (閔丙奭氏) - This person later served as the Director of the Yi Royal Household Office (李王職長官). He also frequented the palace closely during Emperor Sunjong's youth because he was a relative by marriage (戚臣).
Viscount Yi Chaekon (李載崐氏) - A person who later served up to Minister of Education (學部大臣).
Hun Yŏngch'an (勛泳瓚氏) - Currently in Peking (北京), he is the younger brother of Min Yŏnghwan (閔泳煥).
Min Hyŏngsik (閔衡植氏) - The son of Min Yŏnghwi (閔泳徽氏). <37>
Yun Yonggu (尹用求氏) - A person who lives in seclusion (杜門不出).
Min Hyŏngsik (閔亨植氏) - [Note: This name appears again, possibly a different person or repeated entry.]
Yun Yongsik (尹容植氏) - Currently living in quiet retirement (閑居) in Ŭijŏngbu (議政府), Yangju (楊州). He previously served up to the rank of Minister (判書).
Kim Mansu (金萬秀氏) - Father of Kim Sayŏn (金思演氏), who until recently was the president of the Chosŏn Public Opinion Company (朝鮮公論社長).
Sŏ Sanghun (徐相勛氏) - Currently serving as an Imperially Appointed Councilor (勅任參議) in the Central Council (中樞院).
Yi Kijong (李起鍾氏) - Currently living in quiet retirement in the countryside, Sihŭng (始興).
Chŏng Insŭng (鄭寅昇氏) - This person has also now withdrawn from Seoul and lives quietly in the countryside.
Yun Tubyŏng (尹斗炳氏) - This person has also left Seoul and lives quietly in the countryside.
Kim Sŭnggyu (金昇奎氏) - Currently residing in Sajik-dong (社稷洞), Seoul, spending his later years.
O Chŏnggŭn (吳正根氏) - Currently living quietly in Nagwŏn-dong (樂園洞) within the city.
All the gentlemen listed above were Royal Study Companions when Emperor Sunjong was Crown Prince. These companions were called "P'aedok" (陪讀) or "P'aeri" (陪吏). "P'aedok" literally means those who "attend and read," and "P'aeri" means officials who attend and serve. Among these "P'aedok" and "P'aeri," the persons who attended the Crown Prince the longest were:
Pak Yongsuk (朴容淑氏) - Mr. Pak is currently the Custodian (參奉) of Yŏnghwiwŏn (永徽園) and was one of the closest Royal Study Companions.
Chŏng Chungyŏng (鄭仲永氏) - This person is currently living in Manchuria (滿洲).
Kang P'iru (康弼祐氏) - This person is currently a military attaché (武官) for some royal family and is one of those who served for a long time. <38>
Kim Hŭnggyu (金興圭氏) -
Besides these, there were many others. Furthermore, these individuals generally attended Emperor Sunjong constantly during the four years from Musin (戊申 - 1908) to Sinhae (辛亥 - 1911) when he was on the throne. Also, a particularly noteworthy point is that during the Crown Prince period, although the teaching officials (敎官) were cabinet ministers or renowned scholars, they did not frequent the study hall that often or engage closely with the classics (經書). Mostly, it is said that the Inner Palace Official (內官) Hong T'aekchu (洪宅柱氏) taught writing, and the late Haegang (海岡) Kim Kyujin (金圭鎭氏) taught calligraphy (書) and orchid painting (蘭草). <39>
<34-39>

**Summary**

This 1935 article details the educational system for Korea's Crown Prince during the late Joseon Dynasty, focusing on Sunjong's 33 years as Crown Prince before his brief reign (1907-1910). It describes the *Ch'ungyebang* (later *Seja Sigangwŏn*), the palace institution staffed by high officials and scholars responsible for the Prince's education in civil and military affairs ("Imperial Studies"). The article emphasizes that the Prince studied alongside contemporaries known as *Ŏhagu* (Royal Study Companions) or *P'aedok*/*P'aeri*. It then lists numerous individuals, many still living in 1935 and holding prominent positions (or retired), who served as Sunjong's companions. Finally, it notes that despite the prestigious official instructors, daily teaching was often carried out by lower-ranking figures like an inner palace official and the artist Kim Kyujin.

From a colonial history perspective, the article is interesting as it was written 25 years into Japanese rule, recalling the structure of the former monarchy's educational system for its heir. Listing the surviving companions, many of whom held positions in colonial institutions (like Viscountcies granted by Japan, the Yi Royal Household Office, the Central Council) or managed modern schools, subtly highlights the transition and survival (or co-option) of the old elite within the new colonial framework. It provides insight into the late Joseon court structure and the backgrounds of figures who navigated the turbulent transition to colonial rule.

純宗의 御學友記,
						滄浪客
純宗게서 世子宮으로 게시기는 33年동안이엇다. 甲戌年에 나시어서 그 이듬해인 乙亥年에 東宮에 冊封되여 丁未年卽 明治 41年까지 게시다가, 그 이듬해에 位에 올느서서 隆熙元年에 이르럿스니 그 동안 實로 世子宮으로 게시기는 三十餘年의 긴 세월 사이엇섯다.
그럼으로 이 世子宮시대에 純宗께서는 엇더한 교육을 바드섯는가 함은 실로 注目을 끄으는 問題인데 원래 宮闕에서는 장차 位에 나아가실 어룬에게 대하여는 「帝王學」이라고 할 특수한 교육을 하시엿다. 지금 東京의 例만 보아도 「學習院」이라 하야 이전에 乃木大將이 院長으로 잇스면서 王族과 高貴한 大臣大官의 집 子與侄을 교육하는 기관이 잇섯는데, 그때 半島로 말하면 이와가치 「學習院」제도에 類似한 王公學敎育所는 업고 다만 世子宮을 爲하야 大闕 內에 「春桂坊」 후에 「世子侍講院」이란 기관이 설치되어 잇섯다. 「春桂坊」의 그 당시 조직은 엇더하엿든고 하면 원래 明朝에 「春坊」이라하야 ＜34＞ 東宮의 學問所가 잇섯는데, 朝鮮에서도 이를 본밧어 녜전 三國時代부터 宮中에 「春坊」을 設하여 내려오는 중, 李朝에 이르러 「桂坊」이란 특별한 坊 하나를 더 두엇스니 이것을 春坊은 文科에 대한 敎育所요, 桂坊은 武科에 대한 敎育所라. 나종에 둘을 합처 「春桂坊」이라 하야 文武一切의 帝王學을 가르친 곳이 되었다 한다.
春桂坊이란 일홈은 그 뒤 變更되여 新式으로 「世子侍講院」이라 하엿다. 經國大典에
世子侍講院
掌侍講經
史規諷道
義並用文
官副賓客
이라 하엿스며, 王子를 교육식히는 敎官이란 項目에 이르러보면
以上以他官兼＜35＞
正一品  師一員  領議政兼任

傳一員   左議政兼任

從一品  貳師一員  贊成兼任

正二品  左右賓客  各一員

從二品  左右副賓客  各一員

從三品  輔德一員  兼輔德

正四品  弼善一員  兼弼善

正五品  文學一員  兼文學

正六品  司書一員  兼司書

正七品  說書一員 兼說書

堂上  贊善  一員  山林

堂下  進善  一員

으로 되어 잇다. 즉 世子宮의 교육을 위하여는 당시의 內閣總理大臣인 領議政이나 그밧게 閣臣들이 모다 그 學問所의 職任에 잇섯고 더욱 「山林」이라 하야 一國에서 우러러보는 놉흔 名儒, 말하자면 漢文 잘하는 선비가 또한 그 職任을 마트섯다.

閔丙奭 李載崐氏 等
世子侍講院의 以上 諸職員은 우에서 임명하시느냐 하면 그런 것이 아니고 말하자면 아래서 정하여 禀하여서 결정을 밧으시는 것이다.＜36＞
아무튼 이리하야 世子侍講院의 조직은 완성된 뒤 한 달에 몃츨이란 날자를 정하야 大闕 안 그 學問所에서 世子宮을 나으시게 하여 거기에서 領議政이나 「山林」가튼 學者들이 四書五經도 엇든 때는 書도 畵도 가르치시기로 되엇는데 世子侍講院은 반드시 大闕 內에 잇슴으로 최근의 예를 볼지라도 엇든 때는 景福宮 內에도 잇섯고, 엇든 때는 德壽宮闕 內에도 잇섯다.
그러나, 學問所에 世子 한 분만이 안즈서 공부하시는 것이 아니라, 여기에는 御學友가 잇다. 가튼 년배의 청년들과 함께 冊床을 나란히 하야 학문을 배우시고, 또는 억개를 가지런히 하야 운동이나 遊戱를 하시엇다. 그러면 그 당시 冊床을 나란히 하야 글을 가치 읽으시고, 억개를 나란히 하야 遊戱를 가치 하시든 御學友라 하면 누구누구들이든고, 이제 東宮33년 시대의 御學友를 헤자면 심히 만치마는, 현재 생존하여 잇는 분을 記하면 대개 이러하다고 밋는다.
