Story of Paradise Lost
—Hey, introduce me to a pretty lover, won't you?
—What? Don't you already have a stunning beauty?
—Well, that one disappeared.
—Why?
—Yeah, because I already went and married her.

Sympathetic Judge
A woman was summoned by the judge.
Judge: How old are you?
Woman: (Says nothing.)
Judge: Alright. Then, how old were you twenty years ago?

Boarding Fee, Free
A student and a boarding house landlady are talking.
Student: How much is this room per month?
Landlady: Every guest who comes to this room, without exception, doesn't pay the room rent, so...
Student: Well then, that's settled! Let me rent this room too.

Kiss, Economics
Man—Uh, thanks to you, having to shave twice a day might be somewhat harmful to my skin.
Woman—What? Try shaving only once a day. Won't my skin become even more [beautiful/smooth]? <43>

**Summary**

This article consists of four short, unrelated jokes or humorous anecdotes. The first joke humorously laments that marriage marks the end of having an exciting "lover," equating it to losing paradise. The second pokes fun at a woman's reluctance to state her age, with a judge trying a clever workaround. The third describes a student cleverly exploiting a landlady's admission that tenants in a specific room never pay rent. The final joke involves a couple discussing the frequency of shaving, linking it comically to the effects of kissing on the woman's skin. These jokes reflect common social themes and humor in 1930s Korea, touching on attitudes towards marriage, age sensitivity, landlord-tenant dynamics, and romantic relationships. Historians might find the specific scenarios (like boarding house interactions) and the use of colloquial language and older spellings indicative of daily life and social norms during the colonial period.
