Urgent News, The Inside Story of the Revival of the Chosŏn and Chungang Newspapers, ―How the Long-Locked Doors Were Opened―
						By Ch'angnang Kaekki

Chosŏn Ilbo Section

The Chosŏn Ilbo, which had been suspended, has opened its doors after eight months and is set to turn its rotary presses anew, thanks to the efforts of Mr. Cho Man-sik (曺晩植), one of the leaders of the Hŭngsadan (興士團) abroad and the Tonguhoe (同友會) within Korea, among others. So, what became of the problematic Messrs. An Chae-hong (安在鴻) and Yi Sŭng-bok (李昇馥)? More importantly, what about Mr. Im Kyŏng-nae (林景來), who had seized the publishing rights? And what happened to the former executives like Messrs. Sin Sŏk-u (申錫雨), Ch'oe Sŏn-ik (崔善益), Cho Sŏl-hyŏn (曺설鉉), and the fifty-odd employees? Beyond these personnel relationships, how was the rotary press, which had been seized by the Siksan Bank (殖銀), released? What became of the company building, currently under trial in the High Court (高等法院)? Where will the funds come from to settle the numerous old debts and cover the costs of resuming publication? I take up this pen to unravel the thread of these questions according to the current situation.

One evening this year, as the scorching heat of June was beginning to subside, a certain gentleman visited the elderly former president, Yu Chin-t'ae (兪鎭泰), at the Education Association in Sup'yo-dong (手標町) and stated his sense of responsibility, saying, "I will just get the newspaper back into publication, and then I will go down to my hometown in *ju (*州 - likely P'yŏngju, referring to P'yŏngyang) and take up farming." This gentleman was Mr. An Chae-hong, who had been imprisoned for six months regarding the consumption of 15,000 won in relief funds for Manchuria (在滿救濟金) and released on bail a few days prior. Indeed, for the following four months, Mr. An exerted every effort, true to his word, to revive the newspaper he himself had ruined. Thus, by early October, the time was ripe. He conspired with a Mr. Yi (李某氏), who was the head of a Koji (麯子 - yeast for brewing) Cooperative in Ansŏng (安城) and a former provincial council member; another Mr. Yi (李某氏), a hat merchant outside Namdaemun; and Mr. Pang Kyu-hwan (方圭煥), a former Kyŏngsŏng Municipal Council member who had once caused a stir over a Kyŏngsŏng municipal land purchase incident in Sindang-ri (新堂里), to raise funds, aiming for 10,000 to 20,000 won each. However, when it came down to the concrete contract for establishing the dreamed-of company, everyone demanded that the publishing rights be transferred under their own name, or asked for the presidency, or the position of Business Bureau Director. Consequently, the plan to raise 35,000 won amounted to nothing more than empty words on paper. Mr. An Chae-hong's hopes were shattered after trusting these speculators, who were sharp as needles when it came to profit.

Meanwhile, Mr. Im Kyŏng-nae, who held the publishing rights against a debt of 12,000 won and had published the newspaper for a mere few days—a "three-day reign"—from the old Sidae Ilbo (時代日報) premises in Meiji-chō (明治町) with Messrs. Sin Il-yong (辛日鎔), Yi Chŏng-sŏp (李晶燮), and Kim Hyŏng-wŏn (金烱元), found himself in a financial predicament almost as soon as he grasped the rights, like "launching the boat as soon as the moon rises." When the formation of the stock company he had boasted about and the aid from the Kaesŏng (開城) tycoon Im Han-sŏn (林漢宣) both proved hopeless, he actively sought to sell off the publishing rights peacefully to recoup his investment, negotiating with various people. As the maneuvers of various factions, engaging in all sorts of political appointments (六曺配布), intensified daily, on November 2nd, the Police Affairs Bureau (警務局), deeming the publishers who repeatedly postponed publication as insincere, suddenly summoned Messrs. An Chae-hong, Yi Sŭng-bok, and Im Kyŏng-nae. They declared that if the newspaper did not receive permission to publish by the 5th, they had a plan to potentially revoke the publishing rights altogether <Special 5>. Greatly alarmed, the gentlemen, whatever might happen later, went straight to the company office upon leaving and distributed extras throughout Kyŏngsŏng city announcing the resumption of publication from the 5th. However, when the involved parties held a final meeting, it was the same story: those with money wanted real power, while those who previously held authority clung to their positions. Ultimately, with mutual opposition, the meeting became nothing but a derailed train.

It was at this moment that Mr. Cho Man-sik appeared. As will be detailed below in the Chungang Ilbo section, Mr. Cho had long been striving to start a newspaper in the P'yŏngan North and South provinces (平南北) and had just raised X6,000 won (X萬 6千圓 - the amount is partially obscured/censored) with the intention of taking over the Chungang Ilbo, but things had not gone as planned. Since it was a similar situation ("same price, red skirt" - 同價紅裳格, meaning one choice is as good as another), he decided to manage the Chosŏn Ilbo instead and negotiated with the involved parties, but progress was slow. Consequently, the Police Affairs Bureau summoned Mr. Cho Man-sik, Cho Pyŏng-ok (趙炳玉), and Chu Yo-han (朱耀翰) from the Cho faction; An Chae-hong, Hong U-sung (洪祐崇), and Yi Sŭng-bok from the former executive faction; and Im Kyŏng-nae from the publishing rights faction, forcing a compromise: these seven individuals would form the board of directors and run the newspaper. However, although they agreed in that meeting, upon review, the power of the former executive faction absolutely outnumbered the Cho faction, which was providing the funds. Demands such as appointing An Chae-hong as Chief Editor (主幹), taking over the 200-plus branch offices, reinstating former employees, and giving 50 won each as consolation money were made. Truly, even to a third party, many of these conditions seemed excessively biased. Faced with the difficulty of yielding real power despite investing a vast sum of money, the Cho faction decided to withdraw. At that point, the Police Affairs Bureau threatened once more that if the newspaper did not come out by the 8th, the rights would be revoked without further discussion. Thereupon, due to the sincerity of the An Chae-hong faction—recalling his pledge to Elder Yu upon release from prison, "I will absolve myself of the responsibility for having killed the newspaper with my own hands"—various conditions were withdrawn and concessions made. It was decided that the former executives would completely step aside, and the Cho faction would manage the company. However, there were rumors that this concession was later retracted.

In any case, although the future situation is unknown, perhaps by the time this magazine reaches the streets, the newspaper will already be circulating.
The rotary press was reportedly taken over by the new faction for a monthly rent of XX won (amount obscured/censored), and the debt issues concerning the branch offices were resolved. Thus, stepping onto fresh ground, the Chosŏn Ilbo seems poised to resume publication today or tomorrow. It is heard that the former executives will continue to use two rooms within the newspaper office to handle liquidation matters.

Let's briefly note the rumored lineup of Mr. Cho's "cabinet" and observe the situation further. It seems a foregone conclusion that Cho Man-sik will become President, although some say he might yield the position to Tosan (島山 - An Ch'ang-ho's pen name) if An Tosan (安島山 - An Ch'ang-ho) is released. But who can know the future? For Vice President, if the payment for the publishing rights isn't fully made, perhaps Im Kyŏng-nae will take the seat; otherwise, it seems a Mr. Yi (李某氏) will come in. Chu Yo-han is slated for Editor-in-Chief, and Cho Pyŏng-ok for Business Bureau Director. As for the staff, it appears that most of the former employees will continue working—though, of course, those whose ideologies significantly diverge from the Tonguhoe's principles might resign voluntarily. Another point: the Cho side reportedly asked An Chae-hong to take a key position in the company, but he firmly declined.

Finally, let me conclude by noting the figures involved in the various tragedies brought about by the Chosŏn Ilbo. Messrs. An Chae-hong and Yi Sŭng-bok, released on bail after being imprisoned over the 15,000 won Manchurian Compatriot Fund issue, might soon bear the dishonorable criminal charges and groan behind bars again, as their case has moved from the preliminary judge to public trial. Mr. Sin Sŏk-u, who succeeded Yi Sang-jae (李商在) as the third president, has not only seen his fortune, estimated at 200,000 won, collapse, but misfortunes never come singly—he also suffered the loss of his father (外艱喪) and was even detained at a police station for a time due to the "iron bar incident" (鐵條網事件). Former Editor-in-Chief Han Ki-ak (韓基岳), overwhelmed by anxiety and worry, damaged his nerves and secluded himself at Anyangsa Temple (安養寺) outside the city. Mr. Kwŏn (權氏), severely injured during the iron bar and violent gang incident (鐵條窓과 폭력단事變), spent two months hospitalized for treatment. Besides these, there were over a hundred employees suffering on the brink of starvation (饑餓線上), executives who went personally bankrupt, and so on—the list of miseries is endless. As the numerous old company debts, calculated at 100,000 won including branch office debts, paper costs, and machinery costs, are now being settled, how many more sad and heartbreaking hardships and tragedies will unfold behind the scenes of the resumed publication?

Regardless, the Chosŏn Ilbo, a powerful tank of culture that provided good spiritual nourishment to the masses, now welcomes new workers <Special 6> and opens its doors to the sunlight, which is immensely gratifying. Let us earnestly hope that the worst-case scenarios of closure and suspension do not befall it again.

Chungang Ilbo Section

The Sidae Ilbo (時代日報), published under the name of Ch'oe Nam-sŏn (崔南善), collapsed due to the Poch'ŏn'gyo (普天敎) affair. It was revived by Hong Myŏng-hŭi (洪命熹) and others, but that too met its demise (*地 - likely means 'failed' or 'hit the ground'). Then, under Yi Sang-hyŏp (李相協), its title changed to Chungoe Ilbo (中外日報), but it also succumbed to misfortune and closed its doors. After a considerable interval, its lifeline was revived as the Chungang Ilbo (中央日報) under the hand of Dr. No Chŏng-il (盧正一), an American Ph.D. in philosophy. This newspaper organization, with its turbulent lineage, had suspended publication this summer in April due to dire company circumstances. It subsequently provided numerous news items that shocked society, including employee lock-ins (籠城), hunger strikes (飢餓同盟), and the police arrest of negotiators. Now, this Chungang Ilbo has opened its doors on November 1st, and its rotary press is turning once again. This is undeniably cheerful news, breaking the atmosphere of disappointment, gloom, and silence that had pervaded our press society. I shall now omit the details of all the paths trodden during this time. This is because the comings and goings of people were too numerous, and the threads of events too complex, making a complete account impossible for anyone but a newspaper specialist. Furthermore, even if described, it likely wouldn't hold much interest. Therefore, focusing on the most recent events: the date Dr. No pledged to the Head of the Publications Division and the Chief of the Police Department at the Police Affairs Bureau (警務局 圖書課長과 경찰부장) that he would definitely resume publication was sometime in October. However, having lost his financial backer, Mr. Kim (金某氏), Dr. No likely had no funds for resumption in hand. Yet, there was one hope: a tacit agreement with the faction of Cho Pyŏng-ok, who was bustling about raising funds with a strong base in the P'yŏngan North and South provinces (平南北).

In fact, Cho Pyŏng-ok had a relationship of mutual trust (肝膽相照) with Cho Man-sik, a respected figure in the Kwansŏ (關西 - northwestern region, P'yŏngan provinces) area, being fellow members of the Tonguhoe. He was also comrades with the progressive commentator Chu Yo-han, as they were part of the same group (구룹멘 버- - likely 'group member'). These three, forming a trio (3羽鳥 - three-feathered bird), had begun collaborating with financiers in the Kwansŏ region more than just a month or two ago. When the Shanghai Incident (上海事變) occurred this spring and, in its aftermath, An Tosan (An Ch'ang-ho) was captured and returned to Korea, rumor had it that the Tonguhoe faction set its sights on newspaper management, reasoning that Tosan would need a platform upon his release from prison and should thus be installed as newspaper president. In any event, their efforts were not in vain. Having gathered X6,000 won (X萬 6千圓) in cash, they rushed to Kyŏngsŏng in late October to finalize a contract for the transfer of publishing rights with No Chŏng-il, only to find that he had already made a provisional agreement with someone else just three hours earlier, according to reports. Thus, Cho Pyŏng-ok, furious at No's breach of faith, turned to the Chosŏn Ilbo, as mentioned earlier.

So, with whom had Dr. No made the prior agreement? It was Ch'oe Sŏn-ik (崔善益). Mr. Ch'oe Sŏn-ik's name is known to anyone with even a little common knowledge of the newspaper world; he is a former Chosŏn Ilbo executive and a young, wealthy man from Kaesŏng, a graduate of Waseda University (早大) in Tokyo. Having previously invested over 100,000 won in the Chosŏn Ilbo, he had disagreed with Sin Sŏk-u, returned to his hometown, and dedicated himself to business, cutting direct ties with the newspaper world for several years.
Mr. Ch'oe found a comrade: Yun Hŭi-chung (尹希重) of Ch'ŏnan (天安). A local magnate said to possess 3,000 sŏk (石) of rice land (worth approximately 200,000 won, though there are rumors some land was mortgaged to the Siksan Bank - 殖銀), he harbored grand ambitions to re-enter the newspaper world with Ch'oe, biding his time. When negotiations for resuming the Chosŏn Ilbo proved unsuccessful, they shifted their focus to the Chungang Ilbo, secretly plotting and reaching the point of signing a contract. They reportedly paid No Chŏng-il a premium (權利金) of 6,000 or 10,000 won, took over the debts related to the building, rotary press, typefaces, etc., and the contract was concluded without any troublesome personnel conditions. Even the prominent figures in Chang'an (長安 - term often used for Seoul/Kyŏngsŏng) were unaware until the day of the announcement that Ch'oe Sŏn-ik was taking over the Chungang Ilbo. The matter proceeded that swiftly and discreetly, without leaking to the outside.

So, where did Ch'oe Sŏn-ik suddenly get tens of thousands of won? According to rumors, he sold a bus route (自動車 線路) he owned in Kaesŏng. Furthermore, it's said he plans to sell numerous shares he holds in an electric company to fund the newspaper. Eventually, at some point, Messrs. Ch'oe Sŏn-ik and Yun Hŭi-chung <Special 7> will likely seek to manage the company either through stocks, like the Tong-a Ilbo, or as a partnership, gathering untainted capital (淨財) from society. In this respect, the resuming Chosŏn Ilbo will likely follow the same path.

The formation of the Chungang Ilbo's 'cabinet' was remarkably speedy, matching the swiftness of the contract. Here, we discover a formidable presence: the "Thousand-League Horse" (千里駒) Editor-in-Chief, Kim Tong-sŏng (金東成). Formerly, shortly after the March First Movement (己未), as a reporter for the Tong-a Ilbo, he attended the Pacific Press Conference and suddenly gained the honorable position of Vice Chairman, causing a great sensation in society. Due to subsequent circumstances, he had long severed ties with the newspaper world, so his reappearance now is a welcome surprise to many. Mr. Kim shares the same hometown as Ch'oe Sŏn-ik, and when Mr. Ch'oe was active at the Chosŏn Ilbo, Mr. Kim Tong-sŏng also worked alongside him.

In any case, with this lineup, the long-dormant newspaper began pouring out from the rotary press starting November 1st. Reportedly, since the publisher's name is still listed as No Chŏng-il, they couldn't loudly announce the resumption while continuing publication, but once the name change is processed, they plan to make a great leap forward as an 8-page newspaper.

Thus, the doors of the two closed newspaper companies have reopened amidst the cheers of the multitude. How intense will the battle for supremacy among the three newspaper companies—including the Tong-a Ilbo—now become? A battle for sales, for advertising, for influence... Based on future personnel assignments and the key territories for newspaper sales, I intend to report further on the struggle for supremacy among the three newspapers as events unfold. (Recorded morning of November 8th) <Special 8>

**Summary**

This 1932 article details the complex negotiations, financial struggles, and personnel changes behind the imminent revival of two major Korean newspapers, the Chosŏn Ilbo and the Chungang Ilbo, after periods of suspension. The Chosŏn Ilbo's revival involved figures like Cho Man-sik and An Chae-hong, navigating debts, seized assets, publishing rights disputes held by Im Kyŏng-nae, and intervention by the Japanese Police Affairs Bureau. The Chungang Ilbo's resumption, following multiple failed iterations (Sidae Ilbo, Chungoe Ilbo), was secured by Ch'oe Sŏn-ik and Yun Hŭi-chung, who purchased the rights from No Chŏng-il, bringing back prominent journalist Kim Tong-sŏng. The article anticipates fierce competition among these two revived papers and the existing Tong-a Ilbo.

For historians, this article offers a valuable glimpse into the precarious state of the Korean press under Japanese colonial rule, highlighting financial instability, internal power struggles within nationalist-leaning organizations (like the Tonguhoe), the significant role of individual financiers, and the direct intervention and pressure exerted by the Japanese colonial authorities (Police Affairs Bureau) in the operation and licensing of newspapers. The mention of An Ch'ang-ho (Tosan) and the legal troubles of figures like An Chae-hong further contextualizes the political risks faced by Korean intellectuals and journalists.

朝鮮日報篇
해외에선 興士團이요 海內에선 同友會의 首腦者 중 一人인 曺晩植氏 등 손으로 停刊 중에 잇든 조선일보가 8개월만에 門戶를 열고 새로 輪轉機 박휘를 돌니게 되엇다. 그러면 문제의 安在鴻
李昇馥씨는 엇더케 되엇는고? 그보다도 版權을 가로차고 안젓든 林景來氏는? 또 申錫雨
崔善益
曺설鉉氏 등의 舊幹部와 50여 명의 社員들은 엇더케 되엇는고? 이러한 人的 관계보다 殖銀에 잡히엇든 輪轉機는 엇더케 되어 풀려나왓고 高等法院에서 재판 중에 잇는 社屋은 엇더케 되엇는고 多數한 舊債의 정리와 압흐로 續刊 비용 등은 어대에서 나오려는고? 이 의문의 실마리를 爲先 今日의 형편대로 푸러보려고 이 붓을 잡엇다.
今年 6월 炎天도 거이 기우러지려하는 하릇저녁 手標町 교육협회에 前사장 兪鎭泰老를 차저서 『신문을 續刊만 시키고 나는 *州의 고향에 내려가서 농사짓겟슴니다』
하고 책임감을 말하는 一紳士는 15,000원의 在滿救濟金消費때문에 入獄 6개월 하엿다가 數日前에 保釋出獄이 된 安在鴻氏엿다. 과연 安氏는 以來 4개월을 두고 그말대로 제손으로 망친 신문을 부활시켜노려고 가진 애를 다썻다. 그래서 10월 초순에 이르러는 機가 熟하엿다. 曰安城서 麯子組合長으로 잇고 曾經道評의원한 李某氏와 남대문밧 笠子商하는 李某氏와 新堂里의 京城府토지 買收사건으로 一代를 울니든 曾經 京城府 協議員 方圭煥氏 등과 結托하여 萬圓乃至 2萬圓式 모으게 하엿다. 그러나 莫想회사성립의 구체적 계약성립에 들어가매 저마다 제 일홈으로 版權을 넘겨라, 社長을 달나 營業局長 椅子를 달나하게 되어서 35,000원을 모을 작정이든 돈이 紙上空文밧게 더되 잘 것이 업시되엇다. 安在鴻氏는 商利엔 百怜百俐한 이 풍꾼들을 밋다가 모든 꿈이 깨어젓다. 한편 12,000원 빗에 版權을 잡고서 明治町 時代일보 집자리에서 辛日鎔
李晶燮
金烱元氏 등을 이끌고 몃칠을 신문을 내든 3일 天下의 林景來氏는 「달뜨자 배떠나자」格으로 版權쥐자 資金難에 걸려 헛풍치든 주식회사 성립도 開城富豪 林漢宣氏의 援助도 모다 無望하게 되자 版權이나 고이 팔어넘겨 제 미천 뽑아내려고 이 사람 저 사람과 版權이동을 盛히 꾀하엿다. 時時刻刻으로 온갓 6曺配布를 다하는 各派의 策動이 나날이 더 심하여 갈 때 11월 2일에 至하여 俄然 警務局에서는 延期에 又延期를 거듭하는 發行人들을 無誠意하다 認하야 여차직하면 發行權이라도＜特別5＞ 취소시킬 腹案을 가지고 그날 安在鴻
李昇馥
林景來氏 등을 불너 初5일까지 신문을 발행승� 안으면 취소한다고 선언하엿다. 大驚失色한 諸氏는 나종에야 엇지되엇든 나오든 길로 社에 나와서 5일붓터 續刊함니다하는 號外를 京城 全市에 돌녀노코 관계자가 최후의 회의를 하여 보앗스나 亦 돈잇는 사람은 實權을 잡자하고 녜전 權勢잡엇든 사람은 지위에 戀戀하고 終乃 彼將我將으로 회의는 無軌道열차가 될 밧게 업섯다. 이러할 때에 曺晩植氏가 출현하엿다. 이 아래 中央일보篇에 가서 詳述하겟거니와 曺氏는 平南北에서 벌서 오래전부터 신문을 하려고 奔走하든 분이라 현금 X萬 6千圓을 만드러쥐고 중앙일보를 하려다가 일이 如意치 못하엿든 바로 뒤엇다. 同價紅裳格이라고 그럴 바에는 조선일보를 경영하기로 決意하고 관계자에 교섭하엿스나 잘 진행되지안엇다. 그리되자 警務局서는 曺氏派로 曺晩植
趙炳玉
朱耀翰氏와 舊幹部派로 安在鴻
洪祐崇
李昇馥氏 등과 版權派로 林景來氏를 불너 前記7人으로 理事를 삼고 신문을 하라고 타협식혓다. 그러나 그 자리에선 녜하고 대답하고 나와서 본즉 돈을 내는 曺氏派보다 녯 幹部派의 세력이 절대 과반수요 安在鴻씨를 主幹으로 써라. 又 2百餘 處 支社를 引繼하라 社員을 復職식혀라 50圓式 위로금을 주어라 등등 實로 그 조건이 第三者가 보기에도 너무 치우친 것이 만엇다. 이리되매 무진장한 돈을 쓰고도 實權을 주기 어렵게 되자 曺氏派는 물너안게 되엇다. 그때 警務局서는 또한번 8일까지 신문이 안나오면 두말업시 취소하겟다고 울넛다. 이에 出獄 즉시 兪翁에게 盟誓하든 「내 손으로 신문 죽엿다는 책임을 免하여노코야 말겟다」하든 安在鴻氏派의 誠意로 諸조건이 撤廻  양보되어 舊幹部는 一切 손을 끈코 曺氏 一派에서 경영하기로 되엇다. 云하더니 또 그 양보를 撤回하엿다든가.
아무튼 今後 形勢莫知나 신문는 아마 이 잡지가 市井에 나갈 때에 벌서 나돌지 안을것일가.
輪轉機는 月貰 XX圓으로 新派側에서 마터 쓰기로하고 支局의 債務관계는 一掃되고 이리하야 生新한 地盤을 밟고 朝鮮일보는 今明에 續刊이 될 듯하다. 드르니 舊幹部들은 新聞社內의 방두개를 그냥 쓰기로하고 거기에서 淸算事務를 보리라든가.
風聞에 들니는대로 曺氏 系組閣이나 적고 압흐로 좀 더 形勢를 觀望하기로 하자.
社長에 曺晩植氏가 되리라함은 旣定한 사실인 듯 或者 安島山이 나오면 그때는 島山에게 讓位하리라 云云하나 未來之事를 能誰知리요 副社長에는 版權代로 돈을 치르지 못하게되면 아마 林景來氏가 안게 될 것이요 그러치 안으면 李某氏가 올 것 갓다하며 편집국장에는 朱耀翰氏요 영업국장에 趙炳玉氏 그리고 社員은 아마 대부분 舊社員이 그냥 일을 보게 될 듯 하다고―그야 그 중에 同友會주의 主張과 너무 사이가 잇는 思想人들이야 自退하겟지만―또 한가지 曺氏측에서 安在鴻氏에게 社의 要職에 잇서달나고 請하엿더니 固辭하더라고.

끗흐로 조선일보로하야 生成된 諸비극의 인물들을 記하고 이 붓을 거두자 15,000원의 在滿同胞金 문제로 入獄하엿다가 保釋된 安在鴻
李昇馥 兩氏는 사건이 豫審判事의 손을 떠나 公判에 回附되엇슴으로 이제 판결나는대로 명예스럽지못한 罪名을 질머쓰고 두분은 다시 鐵窓에서 呻吟하게 될는지 몰으고 李商在氏 後를 繼하야 第三代社長이 된 申錫雨氏는 世稱 20萬圓하든 재산도 己倒한데다가 禍不單行이라고 外艱喪까지 당하엿스며 더구나 한때는 鐵條網사건으로 경찰서 유치장에까지 가치어 잇섯섯다. 편집국장이든 韓基岳氏는 惱心焦思의 餘에 신경을 傷하여 市外 安養寺에 閉居하고 鐵條窓과 폭력단事變에 重傷하야 2개월을 입원 치료 중이든 權氏 그 밧게 饑餓線上에서 惱苦하든 百餘 社員 諸氏와 幹部로서 개인적으로 破産當한이 등등 그 慘苦을 數하자면 限이 업겟다. 이제 各 支局에 대한 負債와 조히갑 기계갑 등 10萬圓으로 손을 곱든 諸舊社債를 정리하여 나아가는데 따라서 또 얼마나한 슬프고도 긔막힌 苦狀과 비극이 續刊의 幕後에서 장차 반복될는고.
아모튼 多數한 사회민중에게 조흔 정신적 糧食을 제공하든 문화의 一강력한 탕크! 朝鮮일보가 이제 새로운 일군을＜特別6＞ 마지하야 문을 여러 햇빗을 맛게 되니 깁부기 그지업다. 다시 이제 閉門 停刊 등의 최악의 경우가 다닥처 오지말기를 切切히 바라노라.

中央日報篇
崔南善氏의 名義로 나왓든 時代日報가 普天敎바람에 붕괴되고 다시 洪命熹氏 등의 손으로 再興되엿다가 그것마저 *地하자 李相協氏손으로 中外日報라고 그 題號가 變更되어 나왓다가 그 亦 悲運에 들어 閉門한 뒤 한참잇다가 다시 그 命脈이 美國철학박사 盧正一氏 手로 중앙일보가 되어서 再現한 波蘭만튼 이 一連된 系統의 신문기관이 今夏 4월에 社運의 悲境으로 休刊이 되고 이어 사원의 籠城 飢餓同盟, 交涉員의 경찰被檢 등 實로 사회를 놀내이든 幾多의 뉴-쓰을 제공하여오든 중앙일보가 11월 1일부터 開門하고 輪轉機가 다시 돌게 되엇다. 이것은 실망과 低調, 침묵에 잠기엇든 우리 언론사회의 空氣를 깨처논 유쾌한 報導의 一이 아니될 수 업다. 나는 이제 그동안 지내여온 모든 經路를 略하리라. 그것은 그 사이에 人的 往來도 너무 만헛고 事端의 갈피도 너무 복잡하엿슴으로 신문전문가 이외에는 그 敍述을 완전히 할 수 업슬 뿐더러 또한 記述하엿다 하여도 그러케 흥미를 끄을 일이 못되리라. 그럼으로 최근 중에도 又 최근 事를 기록하여 보건대 盧박사가 신문을 기여히 續刊하겟다고 警務局 圖書課長과 경찰부장에게 맹세한 날자가 10월 某日이엇다. 그러나 財政의 일꾼이든 金某氏 등을 일코 나안즌 盧박사의 손에는 續刊할 비용이라고 손에 잇섯슬리업다. 그러나 한가지 희망은 잇섯다. 그것은 平南北에 有勢한 地盤을 가지고서 資金운동으로 東西奔走하는 趙炳玉氏 一派와의 黙約이엇다. 사실 趙炳玉氏는 關西의 名望家 曺晩植氏와는 가튼 同友會 同志라는 一點에 잇서 肝膽相照하는 사이엇섯고 新進論客 朱耀翰氏와도 亦 가튼 구룹멘 버-란 점에서 同志사이엇섯다. 이 세분이 3羽鳥가 되어 關西一帶의 자산가와 結托을 맷기 시작한지는 벌서 한두달 사이만이 안이엇다. 今春 上海事變이 이러나고 餘波로 安島山이 잡혀 朝鮮으로 도라오자 風聞대로 적으면 島山이 出獄한 뒤 발부칠 地盤이 업스니 島山을 신문社長에 推戴할 수밧게 업다하야 同友會系에서 신문경영에 뜻을 두엇다 전한다. 엇지하엿든 諸氏의 노력이 空歸되지안어서 현금으로 X萬 6千圓을 모아 쥐고서 10월下旬에 急遽 上京하여 盧正一氏와 版權移轉의 계약을 하려한 즉 벌서 다른 분과 假계약을 하고 난 뒤엇다. 말로는 3시간이 느젓더라고 이리하야 趙炳玉氏는 盧氏의 無信을 憤慨하면서 朝鮮日報에 走하엿다함은 前述한 바와 如하다. 그러면 盧氏는 누구와 先約하엿든고 그는 崔善益氏라 崔善益氏의 일흠은 신문사회에 多少라도 常識잇는 분은 모다 알 前 조선일보 幹部요 開城의 少壯富豪인 東京 早大출신이엇다. 氏는 일즉 朝鮮일보를 위하야 10여 만원을 기우렷다가 申錫雨氏와 의견이 맛지안어 고향에 내려가 實業에 精進할 따름으로 신문사회와는 직접으로 발을 끈코 여러 해를 내려온 분이엇다.
崔氏는 同志한분을 어덧다. 그는 天安의 尹希重氏라 3千石(約20萬圓)을 한다는 지방의 巨富로 殖銀에 토지 얼마가 드러갓다는 說도 잇스나)로 더부러 신문사회에 再擧할 壯圖를 품고 時機를 엿보다가 朝鮮일보의 續刊 交涉이 不如意하게 되매 一轉하야 中央일보에 뜻을 두고 暗密히 計策하야 계약까지 매짐에 이르럿다. 盧正一氏에게 權利金으로 6千圓인가 1萬圓인가를 주고 그리고 社屋과 輪轉機 活字 등의 債務를 그대로 引繼맛고 人事의 까다로운 아모 조건도 업시 계약은 성립되엇다. 崔善益氏가 中央日報를 하게 되엇다는 소리는 長安人士들도 발표당일까지 몰낫다. 그러케 일은 速하엿고 外部에 漏洩됨이 업시 깜족갓치 하엿섯다. 그러면 崔善益氏는 갑작히 어듸에서 數萬의 돈이 생기엇는고하면 風聞에 듯건대 開城에 가지고 잇든 자동차 線路을 팔엇다는데 이제 그 밧게도 電氣회사에 가지고 잇는 株券多數를 팔어 신문사 資金으로 삼으리라든가.
畢竟 어느 時期에 이르러는 崔善益
尹希重＜特別7＞ 兩氏는 社의 경영을 東亞일보사 모양으로 株式으로 하든지 合資회사로 하여 一世의 淨財를 모이려 하리라. 이 점에선 續刊하는 조선일보 亦 同一하리라.
중앙일보의 組閣은 그 계약이 신속하엿든만치 非常히 스피-드엇다.
이라 여기에서 거대한 존재를 발견하리라. 그것은 편집국장의 千里駒 金東成氏다. 예ㅅ날 己未후 얼마아닌 때에 東亞일보 기자로서 태평양 기자대회에 참석하여 一躍 副會長의 榮位를 밧어 사회적으로 크게 센세순을 주든 분인데 그 뒤 사정이 잇서 신문사회와 오래 발을 끈엇다가 이제 부활한터이라 氏의 출현에는 多數한 사람이 조흔 의미로 놀낫섯다.
氏는 崔善益氏와 고향을 갓치 하엿고 朝鮮일보에 崔氏 활약할 때에 東成氏도 갓치 손을 맛잡고 일을 보아왓섯다.
엇잿든 이러한 陳容을 가지고 11월 1일부터 오래 잠겻든 신문지가 輪轉機로부터 쏘다저 나오게 되엇다. 듯건대 아직 盧正一氏 名義로 발행인 名義가 그냥 잇서 續刊은 하면서도 굉장히 續刊소리를 못첫스나 압흐로 名義변경이 됨에 따라 8頁신문으로 하여서 大飛躍하리라든가.

이리하야 다첫든 두 신문사의 門은 萬人 歡呼의 소리속에서 다시 續刊되엇다. 이제 東亞日報까지 세 신문사는 엇더케나 불이 날 爭覇戰을 치르러는고 販賣戰으로 廣告戰으로 勢力戰으로―압흐로 人員 배치와 신문판매의 주요地盤 등을 보아 三신문사의 爭覇戰을 다시 隨時 報導하려 하노라.(11월 8일 오전記)＜特別8＞
