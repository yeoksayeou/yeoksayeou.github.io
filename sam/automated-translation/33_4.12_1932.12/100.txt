Our Nostalgic Sentiment
Playing Farmers' Music (農樂) While Holding Farmers' Banners (農旗)

South of Seoul, in the provinces of Ch'ungch'ŏng, Chŏlla, and Kyŏngsang, when the farming season arrives, farmers organize what is called *nongak* (農樂, farmers' music). The members unite and take turns helping each other with their farming tasks. At such times, when they go out to the fields together before sunrise, or when they return from the fields in the evening, the farmers place the *nonggi* (農旗, farmers' banner) at the front and play drums, *p'iri* (double-reed oboe), and *chŏttae* (transverse flute).

Ah- Friends,
Listen to these words I say.
Our Chosŏn, the most scenic place under heaven,
Everywhere you go is royal land piece by piece.
Ŏl, nŏllŏl, sangsa dwi—

Cultivating fields in high places,
Preparing rice paddies in low places,
Its name is renowned throughout the wide world.
This place is the home of agriculture (農産터).
Ŏl, nŏllŏl, sangsa dwi—

Finishing work (畢役) when the moon rises,
Returning home, wife and children greet me.
Washing this body soiled with earth,
The taste of the barley rice I eat is also good.
Ŏl, nŏllŏl, sangsa dwi—

One sees them singing like this.
Although this too was very prevalent in the old days,
recently it is gradually becoming rarer to hear. <36>

**Summary**

This short article from 1932 describes the rural Korean tradition of *nongak* (farmers' music and cooperative labor) found in the southern provinces (Ch'ungch'ŏng, Chŏlla, Kyŏngsang). It highlights the communal aspect of farming, the use of farmers' banners (*nonggi*), musical instruments, and includes lyrics from a typical farmers' song celebrating the land, labor, and simple life. The piece concludes by lamenting that this cherished tradition is becoming increasingly uncommon. For historians, the article offers a glimpse into rural folk culture and communal labor practices during the colonial period. The mention of its decline hints at the social and cultural changes underway, potentially influenced by modernization efforts or the hardships of the colonial economy impacting traditional community structures.

그리운 우리 情調
農旗들고 農樂노리
서울이남으로 충청, 전라, 경상의 각도에서는 농사철이 되면 농부들이 농낙(農樂)이란 것을 조직하고 대원들끼리 단결하여 서로서로의 농사를 차레차레 원조하여 주는데 그럴때 해뜨기전에 여럿이 밧헤 나갈 때나 저녁에 밧헤서 도라올 때마다 농군들은 농긔(農旗)를 압세우고 북, 피리 젓대 등을 불어가며

야-벗님네아
이내 말삼 들어보소
天下勝地 우리朝鮮
간 곳마다 片片王土
얼, 널널, 상사 뒤

놉흔 곳에 밧흘 일고
나즌 곳에 논을 푸러
너른 천지에 일흠도 놉다.
農産터이란 이곳이다
얼, 널널, 상사 뒤―

달이 뜰 때 畢役하고
도라오니 妻子 반긴다
흙에 묵긴 몸을 씻고
먹는 보리밥 맛도 조타
얼, 널널, 상사 뒤―

이러케 노래부르는 것을
본다. 이것도 녯날에는
몹시 성하더니 이 근래에는
점점 듯기 드물게 되어 간다.＜36＞
