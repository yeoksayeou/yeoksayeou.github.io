New Turmoil in North China, Tuan Ch'i-jui Suddenly Appears in Peip'ing; North China Independence Movement Progressing? Notable Maneuvering by the Anfu Clique
(Peip'ing Dispatch) Since Tuan Ch'i-jui recently arrived in Peip'ing, secret comings and goings between Messrs. Wang I-t'ang and Wu Kuang-hsin, Chü Cheng, Wu Ch'ao-shu, as well as the leadership of the Chang Hsüeh-liang faction and representatives of Yen Hsi-shan, have become increasingly frequent, presenting the appearance that the independence movement for political power in North China (北支) is flourishing. One faction is also considerably active in a movement to oust Chang Hsüeh-liang. The primary question is whether or not Mr. Chang Hsüeh-liang can cut ties with Mr. Chiang Kai-shek. The relationship between Chang Hsüeh-liang and Messrs. Han Fu-ch'ü and Yen Hsi-shan also has room for political compromise from the standpoint of Northern unity. Its realization is seen as not necessarily difficult.
If Chang Hsüeh-liang succeeds in severing relations with Mr. Chiang Kai-shek, it appears the Anfu clique (安福派) will step forward as the public face of North China's independence. The attitudes of Tuan Ch'i-jui and Mr. Chang Hsüeh-liang are drawing attention. (Photo shows Northern China Generals)

Recent News of Various Figures
When I visited Mr. Ch'oe Rin at his Kye-dong residence the other day, he was engrossed in reading a biography of Napoleon.
Mr. Pak Mun-hŭi, after returning from Peking, underwent interrogation by the Military Police and the Chongno Police Station and was reportedly released without incident. As he is the cousin's husband (當妹夫) of Kim Wŏn-bong, the leader of the Ŭiyŏltan (Righteous Brotherhood), it seems he was questioned for that reason.
Mr. Han Ki-ak is said to be suffering recently from a nervous breakdown due to overwork related to the Chosŏn Ilbo incident.
Mr. Hŏ Hŏn is reportedly very busy receiving visitors and promoting the treatment methods at the Sunlight Therapy Clinic managed by his daughter, Ms. Chŏng-suk. The clinic is receiving extremely favorable reviews, with daily visitors surpassing 40 people.
Mr. Kim Ki-jŏn of Ch'ŏndogyo had been recuperating from tuberculosis at Yujŏmsa Temple on Kŭmgangsan. As he gradually recovered, he came up to Seoul about a month ago for treatment at the Medical College Hospital, was discharged again, and is currently undergoing treatment at Ms. Hŏ Chŏng-suk's clinic.
Regarding Mr. An Chae-hong's case involving the Relief Fund for Koreans in Manchuria (在滿同胞救濟金), it is said to have been referred to public trial. Since the law does not grant suspended sentences for repeat offenses within 7 years after receiving a first sentence, Mr. An himself seems resigned to being imprisoned.
Lawyers Sin T'ae-ok and Yang Yun-sik reportedly attended the All-Korea Lawyers' Conference held at Kŭmgangsan, expressing immense <6> vigor, and returned a few days ago.
A certain Gold Mine King (金鑛王) is rumored to be engaged in a Peerage Movement (貴族運動).

Democrats Strong (Photo shows Hoover on the right, Roosevelt on the left), Republican Party like a Lonely Castle at Sunset - Great Attention on the New US Presidential Election -
(New York Dispatch) With barely two weeks left until the final goal, towards November 8th, the entire United States is currently boiling over with the presidential election. Will the Republican candidate, current President Hoover, be re-elected, or will the Democratic candidate, Mr. Roosevelt, seize the crown of glory, leading to the emergence of a Democratic government after a long time? Leaders of both parties, as well as various factions, are naturally exerting all their efforts in campaigning and propaganda. In any case, the impression that the Hoover administration's measures against the recession have generally failed is quite deep. Furthermore, there are signs of some weariness with the Republican government, which has been in power for four consecutive terms since President Harding. Consequently, the momentum hoping for fresh air under a new President is strong. Thus, having recently acknowledged the clear advantage of the Democratic side, studies are reportedly already underway regarding the emergence of a Democratic government through Mr. Roosevelt's election victory and the various policies of the new Democratic government that would change accordingly.

Proposal for Neutralizing the Philippines and Manchukuo - Secret Plan within the US Government -
(Washington Dispatch) A proposal to make the Philippines and Manchuria neutral countries is currently being discussed in utmost secrecy among certain individuals within the US government and diplomatic circles. The originator of the proposal is reported to be Senator Reed, who recently traveled to Europe as an unofficial envoy of the US government, held discussions with the British and French governments regarding the Manchurian issue, and returned home. It is reported that he intends to insert a clause regarding this neutralization plan into the Philippine Independence Bill expected to be deliberated in the next session of Congress. Furthermore, the Philippine independence faction is
expected to oppose this, saying it delays the granting of freedom to the Philippines (比島). Moreover, Japan is said to agree with the neutralization plan, but with the deliberation of the Lord Lytton Report drawing near, it is currently observing the situation quietly.

Snippets from the Academic World
The History of the Korean Economy (朝鮮經濟史), being written by Professor Paek Nam-un of Yŏnhŭi College (廷禧專門學校), is said to be nearing completion soon.
The "Statistical Study of Korea, Volume 4" (數字朝鮮硏究 第四輯), being co-authored by Mr. Yi Yŏ-sŏng and Mr. Kim Se-yong, is expected to be completed soon. The first volume of this work by Mr. Yi is said to have been translated into Chinese and published in China.
It is rumored that a certain individual intends to write a "History of the Korean Social Movement" (朝鮮社會運動史) and is currently collecting materials. <7>

**Summary**

This "Samch'ŏlli News" article from December 1932 covers various topics: potential political upheaval in North China involving warlords like Tuan Ch'i-jui and Chang Hsüeh-liang, potentially aiming for independence from Chiang Kai-shek; updates on prominent Korean figures like Ch'oe Rin, Pak Mun-hŭi (interrogated due to his connection to Kim Wŏn-bong of the Ŭiyŏltan), Han Ki-ak, Hŏ Hŏn, Kim Ki-jŏn, An Chae-hong (facing trial), lawyers Sin T'ae-ok and Yang Yun-sik, and an unnamed "Gold Mine King"; the likely victory of Roosevelt and the Democrats in the US presidential election due to dissatisfaction with Hoover's handling of the Depression; a secret US proposal, possibly by Senator Reed, to neutralize both the Philippines and Manchukuo, a plan Japan supposedly favors but is watching carefully given the impending Lytton Report discussion; and news from the Korean academic world about forthcoming works by Paek Nam-un, Yi Yŏ-sŏng, Kim Se-yong, and an unnamed scholar planning a history of the Korean social movement.

From a historical perspective, the article is interesting for its contemporary view of the complex political situation in China and its potential impact, the perceived weakness of the US Republican party during the Depression, and the early international discussions surrounding Manchukuo's status. For Korean colonial history, the updates on various Korean intellectuals, activists, and professionals (Ch'oe Rin, Pak Mun-hŭi, Han Ki-ak, Hŏ Hŏn, Kim Ki-jŏn, An Chae-hong, Paek Nam-un, Yi Yŏ-sŏng etc.) provide valuable snapshots of their activities and the pressures they faced under Japanese rule, such as police interrogation (Pak Mun-hŭi) and legal troubles related to activism (An Chae-hong). The mention of the Ŭiyŏltan leader Kim Wŏn-bong highlights the continuing relevance of the independence movement, even in seemingly mundane news briefs. The academic news reflects ongoing efforts by Korean scholars to analyze and document Korean society and history despite colonial constraints.

北中의 新風雲, 段祺瑞 北平突現 北中獨立運動 進展乎, 安福派의 注目할 策動
(北平發電) 段祺瑞가 최근 北平에 온 以來 王揖唐, 吳光新의 兩氏와 居正, 伍朝樞 及 張學良系首腦部 及 閻錫山 대표자 等과의 비밀한 往來는 점점 頻繁하게되어 北支政權 독립운동이 盛한 觀을 呈하고 잇다. 엇던 一派에서는 張學良遂出운동도 상당히 行하고 잇는데 爲先 문제는 張學良씨가 蔣介石씨와 손을 끈을 수 잇는가 업는가로 張學良 對 韓復渠 閻錫山 兩氏와의 관계도 北方團結의 見地에서 정치적 타협의 餘地가 잇다. 이 실현은 반드시 곤란치 안타고 보아진다.
만일 張學良이 蔣介石씨와의 관계 絶綠에 성공하면 北支독립의 표면 看板에로 安福派가 진출할 모양으로 段祺瑞와 張學良씨의 태도가 注目된다. (사진은 北中 將領)

安在鴻씨의 在滿同胞救濟金 사건은 公判에 廻附되엇다는데 一次刑을 밧고 나온 뒤 7年內에 再犯이 될 때에는 執行猶豫하여주는 法이 업서서 氏自身은 入監하실 것을 각오하시는 모양이라고

優勢한 民主黨(사진은 右가 후-버, 左가 루츠벨트), 孤城落日의 共和黨 -크게 注目되는 米國 新大統領戰-
(紐育電) 최후의 골-까지 겨우 2週日이 남어잇서 11월 8일을 향하야 지금 米國 全土는 모다 대통령 選擧에 沸騰하고 잇다. 공화당의 대통령 후보자인 現대통령 후-버氏가 再選되거나 그러치안으면 民主黨의 후보자 루-즈벨트氏가 榮冠을 쥐게 되어 오래간만에 民主黨政府가 출현할가? 兩黨의 領袖級은 無論 各派에서 遊設과 선전에 死力을 다하고 잇다. 엇잿든 후-바 政府의 不景氣 대책은 일반으로 실패하엿다고 하는 印象이 상당히 깁흘 뿐더러 벌서 하-딩 대통령以來 4期에 連한 共和黨政府에 多少 厭症이 생긴 氣味가 잇서 此際 新大統領下에 淸新한 공기를 待望하는 氣勢가 强하다. 이리하야 최근 확실히 民主黨側의 優勢를 인정함에 至하여 루-즈벨트氏의 대통령 當選에 의한 民主黨政府의 출현 及 이에 의하야 변화될 民主黨 新政府의 諸정책에 대하야 벌서 연구를 開始하고 잇다한다.

比律賓及 滿洲國의 中立國案, -米政府內의 秘密案-
