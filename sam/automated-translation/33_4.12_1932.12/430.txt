**Body Text Translation:**
Urgent Notice to All Readers Upon Publishing the December Issue
Special 1
We intended to publish the November issue of "Samch'ŏlli" (三千里), which you all kindly read avidly, on the 1st of that month. However, we were astonished to learn on October 25th that the entire manuscript of over 300 pages, submitted to the Censorship Authorities (檢閱當局) on October 8th, was suddenly caught by "unavoidable circumstances" and not a single page could be released. Therefore, over the two days of the 25th and 26th, we exerted all our efforts to create replacement manuscripts entirely anew, submitted them for censorship, and received permission in early November. Consequently, we proceeded with printing day and night, but the printing house's full capacity required over a week just for this printing. Thus, unavoidably, the magazine has only now come out to the public (市井).

For this reason, being unable to put out the December issue now, we have unavoidably designated this month's issue as the December issue. We will make the New Year issue a grand special feature and will definitely release it in advance around December 15th. Therefore, we ask the tens of thousands of readers who have fervently supported and avidly read this journal for four years to deeply understand (深諒) the unexpected situation our company faced this time and to generously overlook (눌너보아주시압) the fact that the November issue became *. We will certainly compensate (代償) for this by * the New Year issue as recompense.

Respectfully, The Publisher/Editor (主幹) of Samch'ŏlli Company (三千里社) <特別1>

**Summary**

The publisher of the magazine *Samch'ŏlli* informs readers about a significant publication delay. The entire manuscript for the November 1932 issue was rejected by censorship authorities after submission. The staff had to rewrite the entire issue in two days, leading to further delays in approval and printing. Consequently, the issue intended for November is being released late and labeled as the December issue. The actual December issue, planned as a New Year special, will be published early, around December 15th, as compensation. This notice vividly illustrates the practical challenges faced by Korean publishers under Japanese colonial rule, specifically the direct impact of censorship (검열) on content and schedules, forcing rapid rewrites and apologies to readers. Historians might find this a concrete example of the pressures and operational difficulties imposed by the colonial censorship apparatus on cultural production.
