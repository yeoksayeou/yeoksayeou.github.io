**Pok Hye-suk Q&A**

Me: If the Prince of Ethiopia asked you to marry him, would you go?
Pok: I wouldn't like it. No matter if he's a Prince, who would marry into such an uncivilized place with dark-skinned people? Even if I gained immense wealth, I wouldn't go. <35>

**Yi Sŏ-gu Q&A**

Me: If I gave you one million Yen on the condition that you had to spend it all within a month, what would you do?
Yi: I would build a palace of glass, summon the beauties of Chang'an (長安美人), call the discontented wanderers of the world (天下의 不平浪人), and host a banquet for a long night (長夜의 宴) so they could be drunk and full (醉且飽). <37>

**Summary**

This short article presents hypothetical questions posed to two individuals, Pok Hye-suk and Yi Sŏ-gu. Pok Hye-suk firmly rejects the idea of marrying an Ethiopian prince, citing his race ("dark-skinned") and the perceived lack of civilization in Ethiopia, even for great wealth. Yi Sŏ-gu responds to a question about spending a million Yen in a month with a fantasy of extravagant indulgence: building a glass palace, surrounding himself with beauties, and hosting a massive feast for the world's "discontented wanderers." From a historical perspective, Pok Hye-suk's answer reveals common racial prejudices and the internalization of colonial-era notions of "civilization" prevalent in 1930s Korea. Yi Sŏ-gu's response, while fantastical, hints at both escapism through wealth and perhaps a subtle awareness of societal discontent ("discontented wanderers").
