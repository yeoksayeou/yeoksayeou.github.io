Heard Notes on Nature and Life (드른 風月記)

Chŏng Manjo ssi (鄭萬朝氏) and the Famous Phrase

I don't know the exact year, but it was September 12th when a grand 60th birthday banquet (回甲宴) was held at a certain great house in the city. At that time, all the renowned Hansi poets (漢詩客) of the capital (長安) were present. When Mr. Chŏng Manjo (鄭萬朝氏), famous for his Hansi poetry, arrived a bit late, someone who had a close relationship with Mr. Chŏng, who was already seated, remarked, "Ah, the foremost talent (第一才子), Chŏng Manjo, arrives now!" Mr. Chŏng immediately replied, saying, "*Chunggu yangjin wŏl samil* (重九良辰越三日)." All the top-tier Hansi poets of the capital who were present couldn't help but marvel at the excellent matching couplet (對句). Why did he say "*Chunggu yangjin wŏl samil*"? *Chunggu* (重九) is September 9th, and since it's autumn, it's a fine season (佳節), thus called *yangjin* (良辰, auspicious time). Also, the 12th is three days after September 9th, hence *wŏl samil* (越三日, passed three days). Looking at it this way, it was indeed an excellent matching couplet to "The foremost talent (第一才子), Chŏng Manjo," causing all the literary figures to admire it again and again.

The Seoul Minister and the Country Scholar

In the old days when the fervor for the state examination (科擧) was intense, country scholars would sell their fields (논과 밧) and come up to Seoul, wandering through government gates and markets, employing all sorts of flattery and means to be appointed to the honorable position of passing the exam. At this time, a certain minister (宰相) in Seoul, observing this spectacle, found it quite displeasing in his heart (於心). One day, he gathered the country scholars, exchanged drinks with them, and then composed the following famous verses, intended to make the country scholars' faces flush [with shame].

一. A pair of boots stuffed with several *kŭn* (斤) of cotton, (雙靴壓着數斤綿)
Tread all day until the evening mist. (踏盡終日又暮煙)

二. A silk green robe trails long on the ground, (練綠周衣長曳地)
A crimson Chinese fan half hides the sky. (眞紅唐扇半遮天)

三. In books, not a single character understands the rules [of propriety/poetry], (書無一字能言律)
Borrowing and owing a thousand gold pieces, constantly spending money. (借負千金常用錢)

四. At the red gates [of officials' houses], all day long bowing visitors, (朱門終日垂頭客)
Always waiting for fellow countrymen [to show off] their high spirits completely. (每待鄕人意氣全)
<147>

**Summary**

This article presents two anecdotes from the past. The first recounts the wit of the famous Hansi poet Chŏng Manjo, who impressed his peers with a clever, impromptu couplet referencing the date at a banquet. The second tells of a Seoul minister from the Chosŏn era who composed a satirical poem mocking the ostentatious dress, lack of substance, debt-ridden lives, and sycophantic behavior of ambitious country scholars who came to the capital seeking success through the state examination system. From a colonial history perspective, the article reveals a continuing interest in and respect for traditional literati culture (Hansi poetry) among some Koreans in 1935. The second anecdote, recalling the perceived corruption and superficiality associated with the late Chosŏn examination system, might reflect a mixture of nostalgia and critique of the past, possibly serving subtly to contrast with (or implicitly justify) the changed social and political structures under colonial rule. Historians might find the persistence of Hansi circles and the critical portrayal of pre-colonial social climbers of interest.
