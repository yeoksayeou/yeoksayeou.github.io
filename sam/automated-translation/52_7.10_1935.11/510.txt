Gratitude and Apology

Speech and art are the summation and also the flower of a nation's spiritual culture. However, looking at the journalism ("쩌나리즘") of our Peninsular society (半島社會) these days, one sees one or two lamentable trends where efforts are not made to raise the level of discourse, but rather solely focused on capturing the sales market through the power of money by increasing page numbers. We do not believe that the reading public, who have already accumulated a high level of culture, will be drawn into this superficial trend (浮虛한 兆朕), but we also know it is something to be cautious about for the healthy development of our civilization.

Time flows like swift waves (若流波), and before we knew it, with the next issue, we will send off this turbulent year, and with the issue after next, we will greet the New Spring. As the months accumulate and the years repeat, we pray that the affection for this magazine (本誌) will grow ever deeper. <300>

**Summary**

This editorial postscript expresses concern about the contemporary state of Korean journalism, criticizing a perceived shift towards commercialism (increasing page count for sales) rather than improving intellectual quality. The author trusts the discerning readership but urges caution for the sake of cultural development. It concludes with reflections on the passage of time and hopes for continued reader loyalty. From a historical perspective, the article offers insight into the cultural anxieties and critiques within colonial Korean society regarding the influence of commercial pressures on media, reflecting debates about national culture and intellectual standards under Japanese rule. The use of terms like "Peninsular society" (半島社會) and the specific critiques of journalism are noteworthy for historians studying media and cultural discourse in 1930s Korea.

感謝와 謝罪
言論과 예술은 그 民族의 精神文化의 總和요 또한 꼿이외다. 그런데 요지음 우리 半島社會의 쩌나리즘을 보면 언론수준을 놉히기에 힘쓰는 것이 아니라 紙數나 만히하야 돈의 위력으로써 판매시장의 占奪에만 致力하는 一二의 개탄할 경향이 보임니다. 이미 놉흔 교양을 싸코게신 독서층이 이 浮虛한 兆朕에 援用되리라고는 밋어지지 안슴니다만은 우리 文明의 건전한 발달을 위하야 또한 用心할 바인 줄 아옴니다.
세월은 若流波로 어느덧 來號로써 波爛만튼 금년을 보내고 來來號로써 新春을 맛게 되엇슴니다. 달이 싸히고 해가 거듭할사록 오직 本誌를 사랑하는 힘이 더 一層 두터워지기를 祝願함니다.＜300＞
