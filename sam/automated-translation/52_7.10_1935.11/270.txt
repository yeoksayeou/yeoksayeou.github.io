詩歌 (Poetry)

East, Middle, Goose, Abundance, Wind
Ch'oe Kyu-dong (崔奎東)

In twilight years, decaying, I lie east of Nak-sŏng (洛城東),
Past anxieties (往㤼) enter my view.
Floating and sinking with the world like a learning egret,
Tired of hearing the wild geese that come and go following the sun.
A scholar's robe long held the ambition for nature's mists and clouds (烟霞志),
White hair is empty, only the richness of years abundant.
Needling the crown of my head, urging self-reflection,
If not you, who else possesses this spirit (風)?

Thinking of You
Yi Un-hyŏk (李雲赫)

In this unfamiliar village, miles away, I finally meet you [in death],
Receiving the obituary a year later feels like a dream.
Your family business unfinished, you departed so suddenly,
My grieving heart sheds blood, staining the autumn wind.
In those days, you resolved to leave your hometown gate,
Swearing not to return until success was achieved.
May fierce rain and violent wind not erode [your memory],
Alone, I pile up [sorrow] with a cup [of wine] in this foreign land.
In life, your noble integrity showed no change of heart (衿色),
In death, your emaciated form (鎌容) holds an incorruptible spirit.
Are your remains now at peace in the common dust?
The returning wild geese in the autumn sky cry empty, sorrowful notes.

Expressing Feelings
Yang Kŭn-hwan (梁槿煥)

Expressing Feelings (Presented to Yang Kŭn-hwan) Pak Ko-bong (朴古峯)
With a cup of wine, affection is like the sea; as you depart, I am alone.
A thousand miles of longing in dreams, at the time when sparse trees shed their leaves.

"Replying in the Same Rhyme" Yang Kŭn-hwan (梁槿煥)
Pouring wine, thinking of you is earnest; I raise the cup and sprinkle it southward.
The mountains full of red leaves understand; a time of deep emotion and heartbreak. <168>

Feelings After Parting at Hae Kŭmgang (Presented to Ch'oe Sŭng-man, Yang Kŭn-hwan)
Meeting by chance was beyond dreams; parting at Hyŏnjong Rock (縣鍾岩) was also sorrowful for people.
Is there no joy in meeting without the pain of parting? Joy turns instead to cultivate worry and fear.
At dusk, as the sun sets, the returning birds are all gone; walking alone in a foreign land, what words for these feelings?
Sending off military vehicles (軍車) disappearing into smoke and dust; the roaring blue waves only aid the sorrow.

Kangnŭng Kyŏngho Lake Yang Kŭn-hwan (梁槿煥)
How can I forget the drunken excitement at Kyŏngho Lake (鏡湖)? My insignificant life (貫微一生) is a native place of dreams.
Climbing Kyŏngp'odae (鏡浦臺), regretful there is no moon; setting a boat adrift, pouring wine, I recall the red-adorned lady (紅粧).
Verdant pines and cypress stand around the lake; white ripples enhance the scenery of the inlet.
The guest gets drunk and sings, I rise and dance; fluttering sea birds turn their heads and soar.

Picture of a Father-Daughter Farewell (Ki Chŏng-ja) By the same author [Yang Kŭn-hwan]

The ambition of the gull and roc is set on the southern sea; spurring the horse (擽馬), I always think of galloping ten thousand leagues.
Why must a man be buried only where he was born? Green mountains everywhere offer a plot of ground.
To achieve my plain ambition, I transcend life and death; secretly promising [to meet] in another heaven, I push aside my family.
Holding back tears, do not ask the date of Father's return; perhaps I will become white bones rolling at the edge of the world.

Passing the Gate But Not Entering
Yi Hak-sŏn (李鶴仙)

Where the streams and mountains are beautiful is my home,
Outside the gate, several field willows slant.
The lovely woods and springs are still as they were,
Regretfully, I turn my head back and stop the carriage.

With a light staff, I tread the autumn of my old mountain late in the day,
The chirping of crickets evokes the traveler's sorrow.
Green bamboo and close friends should be waiting for me,
Facing the wind, melancholy, I slowly turn my head back.

Incidental Feelings on an Occasional Visit to Yu Kyŏng (柳京)
Kim Nŭng-in (金凌人)

Stopping the horse in the slanting sun at Pubyŏk Pavilion (浮碧樓),
In the thousand-year old capital, only the water flows emptily.
Where are the pure spirit and high integrity now?
Only the courtyard flowers sing, causing the traveler sorrow.

Playfully Composed Verse with a Certain Friend
Sopa (小坡) Han Chun-sŏk (韓準錫)

Life has many affairs in its hundred years,
Sweetness, bitterness, decline, glory – all are emptiness.
From ancient times, generals and ministers had no special technique,
They rode the momentum and met the right time, only then becoming heroes.

Presented to a Certain Friend
Wishing to know you my whole life, fortunately entrusting our acquaintance,
New friendship like old is true heart-to-heart friendship.
The meeting of fragrant orchid scents (芝蘭臭合) is seen here,
Unlike people today who only have face-to-face acquaintance (面交).

Mourning Teacher Ch'oe Yŏng-nyŏn of Mehwa
Last night, a great scholar star (奎星) fell in the Western Heaven,
Only now do I realize the Teacher's goodness and peaceful passing.
Poets for ten thousand generations will still look up [to him],
Writing this tribute from a thousand leagues away, tears fall uncontrollably.
<168, 173>

**Summary**

This collection features several poems (Hansi) written in classical Chinese characters by various Korean authors in 1935. The poems explore themes common in traditional East Asian poetry: reflections on aging and mortality (Ch'oe Kyu-dong), grief over a friend's death (Yi Un-hyŏk), the bittersweet nature of friendship and parting (Pak Ko-bong, Yang Kŭn-hwan), appreciation of natural scenery (Yang Kŭn-hwan at Kyŏngho Lake), nostalgia for home (Yi Hak-sŏn), reflections on history and lost glory (Kim Nŭng-in at P'yŏngyang), philosophical musings on life and fortune (Han Chun-sŏk), and mourning a respected teacher (Mourning Ch'oe Yŏng-nyŏn). For historians, the persistence of Hansi composition demonstrates the continuation of traditional literary forms among Korean intellectuals during the colonial period. The poems by Yang Kŭn-hwan mentioning travel, separation, and even "military vehicles" (軍車) hint at the mobility and underlying tensions of the era, while Ki Chŏng-ja's poem depicts a dramatic, possibly politically motivated, departure transcending family ties, reflecting the difficult choices individuals faced.

詩歌
東中鴻豊風
崔奎東

暮年頹臥洛城東
往㤼前塵入望中
與世浮沈着學鷺
隨陽來去厭聞鴻
靑衿久抱烟霞志
白髮空饒歲月豊
針我頂門催發省
非君誰復有斯風

思君
李雲赫

雜鄕天里會君終
接訃隔年與夢同
家業未成忽忽去
惋情灑血腥秋風
當年立志出鄕關
事不成時死不還
狂雨烈風須莫削
一杯獨積他江山
生前高節無衿色
死後鎌容不朽心
骸骨凡塵安在否
秋天歸雁空哀音

敍懷
梁槿煥

敍懷(贈梁槿煥)  朴古峯
杯酒情如海,  臨行我獨之.
千里相思夢,  蕭蕭落木時.

「右次韻」 梁槿煥
置酒思君切,  擧杯南灑之.
滿山紅葉識,  感慨斷腸時. ＜168＞

海金剛別後感 (贈崔承萬 梁槿煥
邂逅相逢夢外思,  縣鍾岩別亦人悲.
寧無逢事別無苦,  喜悅反爲愁惕培.
日暮黃昏歸鳥盡,  獨行異域情何詞.
煙塵裏送軍車沒,  怒號蒼波唯助哀.

江陵鏡湖  梁槿煥
鏡湖醉興何由忘,  貫微一生是夢鄕.
鏡浦臺登無月恨,  放船置酒憶紅粧.
蒼蒼松柏湖周立,  白白漣波浦景揚.
客醉唱歌我起舞,  翻翻海鳥回頭翔.

父女訣別之圖(奇貞子)   上同

鷗鵬所志計南池,  擽馬常思萬里馳.
何畢丈夫埋出地,  靑山到處一坪基.
欲成素志越生死,  暗約他天家族推.
持父歸期莫問涕,  或成白骨轉天涯.

過門不入
李鶴仙

溪山好處是吾家
門外數株場柳斜
可愛林泉依舊在
悵然回首故停車

輕笻晩踏故山秋
蟋蟀聲聲惹客愁
葱竹親朋應待我
臨風怊悵慢回頭

偶訪柳京偶感
金凌人

住馬斜陽浮碧樓
千年古都水空流
淸風高節今何在
唯唱庭花使客愁

與某友戱吟
小坡 韓準錫

人生多事百年中
甘苦悴榮摠是空
古來將相別無術
乘勢逢時然後雄

贈某友
願識平生幸托交
新交如舊卽心交
芝蘭臭合於斯見
不是今人只面交

哭梅下崔永年先生
西天昨夜殞奎星
始識先生善順寧
詩人萬代猶瞻仰
千里題詞涕自零
＜168, 173＞
