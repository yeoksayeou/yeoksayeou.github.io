**Body Text Translation:**
Ah, Torn Asunder
						Yu Chint'ae

To put it in a word, I believe this recent Issue is an unfortunate incident for our academic community (學園) and a great loss for the media organizations (言論機關). It is inevitable that conflict arises between individuals or between peoples when their principles, assertions (主義主張), views, and observations (見解觀察) differ. However, I believe there was absolutely no need to stage such a large fight, spirits soaring to the heavens with the momentum of being torn into three or four pieces (三分四裂), centered around such an insignificant matter as this recent affair. Regarding the Posŏng Chŏnmun Hakkyo issue, I believe Kim Sŏngsu alone acted decisively. Though I don't know the details, according to rumors, the problem arose because the number of new students exceeded the limit by twenty-eight. Having taken responsibility and resigned, this was a great courageous decision (大勇斷) on his part. There are also rumors that the excess was thirty students or some other number, but I believe students who failed to complete enrollment procedures before the deadline (日字末詳 - date unspecified), despite the notice on the bulletin board (揭示板) stating to complete procedures within the time limit, are a separate issue. To put it frankly (露骨的으로), this becomes an issue because it's within our Chosŏn; compared to T'okyo, where a single university or professional school accommodates double the number (倍數) of students, how can something like this be such a big problem? In any case, the occurrence of this problem seems to have been the trigger (導火線). Even supposing the Chosŏn Ilbo first mercilessly threw arrows (활살(弓矢)) [i.e., attacked], if the Posŏng Chŏnmun Hakkyo Alumni Association (普專校友會) had not taken such a hardline stance (强硬한 態度), the issue would not have escalated. And in response to this, if the Tonga Ilbo had exercised sufficient self-restraint (自重), I think the problem would have already been resolved simply. I think the attitudes of both newspaper companies are wrong. It is quite regrettable (遺憾) that newspapers, which grow under the support of the masses (大衆), forget their great mission (使命) and become mere organs for expressing the temporary feelings of individuals. I will state that the fight between the two newspaper companies is exactly like a children's fight (어린아해싸홈) and will not discuss (論難) it further. And concerning the fight resulting from the Chungang Kobo issue, I believe the Tonga Ilbo made a great blunder (大失策). At such a time, ignoring (黙殺) the stark facts and conducting counter-propaganda (逆宣傳) will, I think, be a great obstacle (大支障) to the process of social development. Despite it being something hundreds of students and everyone else knows well, trying to forcefully make good evil and evil good is a great contradiction (大矛盾). Even if one achieved victory by pretending (假裝) evil is good, if the next generation (後進) takes this as a model (模範), society will surely degenerate (退頹). To put it simply, while there is the saying "The ruler, teacher, and father are one body" (君師父一體), for a teacher to send his disciples (弟子) behind iron bars (鐵窓) is an extremely unseemly thing to say. Even supposing (假令) the students' faults (過失) were grave (濃厚), that is not the way things should be done. It shouldn't be considered a great sin (罪) for those people, who are filling gaps due to lack of experience <61> in everything because they don't know well, to have some degree (多少) of fault. Furthermore, as it is the teacher's responsibility (先生의 責任) to train (修練) them so they are without fault, if the teacher's actions also constitute a crime recognized by law, wouldn't it be rather natural (當然) for the teacher to bear the culpability (罪責)? To summarize the above briefly:
Kim Sŏngsu's attitude was decisive (快活), and the Posŏng Chŏnmun Hakkyo Alumni Association's attitude was too rash (輕率). Regarding the Chungang Kobo incident, I think the school authorities (學校當局) made a great blunder (大失策). There is no room for condoning (容認) it. As I intend to speak [more] about the newspaper fight centered on this issue, I will stop here for now. <62>

**Summary**

This editorial by Yu Chint'ae laments the recent fragmentation ("三分四裂") within the Korean community, sparked by controversies at Posŏng Chŏnmun Hakkyo (admissions scandal) and Chungang Kobo (unspecified incident involving teachers and students), and exacerbated by a resulting feud between the Chosŏn Ilbo and Tonga Ilbo newspapers. Yu praises Kim Sŏngsu's decisive resignation over the Posŏng issue but criticizes the Posŏng Alumni Association's rashness, condemns both newspapers for unprofessional conduct likened to a children's fight, and strongly denounces the Chungang Kobo authorities for their handling of their incident, particularly the implication of teachers sending students to jail ("鐵窓"). The author finds the Tonga Ilbo's alleged counter-propaganda regarding the Chungang Kobo affair especially damaging.

For historians, this article offers valuable insight into the internal conflicts and ethical debates within Korean elite society during the Japanese colonial period. It highlights the tensions surrounding prominent private educational institutions and nationalist newspapers, revealing divisions and criticizing the behavior of key figures and organizations. The specific mention of teachers potentially sending students to jail provides a stark glimpse into the disciplinary measures and power dynamics within colonial education, reflecting the pressures and possible abuses of authority under Japanese rule.

嗟呼, 三分四裂
						兪鎭泰
一言以蔽之하고 이번 問題는 우리 學園에 不祥事요 言論機關에 大損失인줄안다. 個人과 個人이나 民族과 民族사이에잇서서로 그 主義主張이나 見解觀察이 다른 는 반듯이 衝突이잇는 것은 必然之事다. 그러나 이번일처럼 대소롭지안은일을 中心하여가지고 三分四裂의 氣勢로 意氣沖天하는 큰싸홈을 演出할 것은 조곰도업는줄안다. 普成專門學校問題로말하면 金性洙個人만은 活潑하게 態度를 取한줄안다. 자서한 것은 몰으나 도는 말을들으면 新入學生이 二十八名이 超過된 것이 問題됨으로 責을지고 辭任한 以上 氏로서는 大勇斷인줄안다 三十名이라든가 얼마라든가 超過라는 말도잇스나 그것은 揭示板에다가 期限內로(日字末詳入學手續完了하라는 注意가잇섯슴에도 不拘하고 그 前에으로 手續를 完了치안은 學生은 別問題줄안다. 露骨的으로말하자면 우리 朝鮮內니 問題가되지 東京서는 한 大學이나 專門學校에 倍數의 學生을 收容한다는데 比하면 이것이 무엇이 그리큰問題가되랴? 如何間이 問題發生은 이것이 導火線이 된모양인대 가령 朝鮮日報가 몬저 無慈悲하게 활살(弓矢)을 던젓다하더라도 普專校友會에서 그럿케 强硬한 態度를 取하지안엇스면 問題는 擴大되지안엇슬것이고 이에 應하야 東亞日報가 十分自重하엿든들 問題는 簡單하게 벌서 解決되엿스리라고생각한다. 두 新聞社의 態度는 兩便을모다 올치안케생각한다. 大衆의 支持下에 生長하여가는 新聞으로 그큰使命을 忘却하고 一時的個個人의 感情의 表現機關이되여버리고 本意가 자못 遺憾스럽다는 것이다. 두 新聞社싸홈은 어린아해싸홈과 갓다는 것을 말하여두고 더 論難치안켓다. 그리고 中央高普問題로 因한 싸움에잇서서는 東亞日報가 大失策인줄안다. 그런 時機에잇서서 嚴然한 事實을 黙殺하고 逆宣傳하여서는 社會發展過程애 大支障이잇슬것이라고 생각한다. 數百名學生이나 모든사람이 잘알고잇는 일임에도 不拘하고 抑止로 善을 惡케하고 惡을 善케하랴는 것은 大矛盾이다. 만약 惡을 善케 假裝하여서 勝利하엿다고하더라도 後進이 이런 것을 模範한다면 社會는 退頹하여지고말거시다. 쉽게말하면 君師父一體라는 말도잇지만은 先生으로 弟子를 鐵窓으로보낸다는 것은 너무나 아름답지못한말이다. 假令 學生의게 過失이 濃厚하엿다섬치더라도 그럿케는 못하는 法이다. 모든 것은 잘몰으로 모든데 體驗이업기로 매우고잇는그사람들의게 多少의 過失이잇다＜61＞는 것이 큰罪가안될것이고 한 過失이업도록 修練식히는 先生의 責任으로 先生이가진것만큼 法律이 認定하는 罪가잇다면 그 罪責은 先生이 가지는 것이 오히려 當然치안을가한다. 以上을 簡單하게 要約하여 말한다면
金性洙氏의 態度는 快活하엿고 普專校友會態度는 너무 輕率하엿다. 中央高普事件은 學校當局이 大失策이라고생각한다. 容認할 餘地가업다. 이 問題를 中心삼은 두 新聞싸홈은 말하겟기에 우선 여게서친다.＜62＞
