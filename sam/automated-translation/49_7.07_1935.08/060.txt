自省
						小坡 韓準錫

Self-Reflection

Of human sins and errors, deceit is the greatest.
Only now do I realize today is right and yesterday was wrong.
I vow to preserve my integrity henceforth in my later years;
Please watch as I reopen the ancient mirror, polished anew.

Expressing Feelings

Through eighty-six thousand, five hundred springs,
Fortunate not to be a common thing, but born a human being.
Whether wise or foolish, rich or poor, all depends on me;
How could I become a aimless wanderer in some remote village?

Impromptu Composition

The joy of life is having wise teachers and parents;
Of all affairs, nothing compares to having good children and grandchildren.
Why is it that the scholars of this age who read books
Mostly watch others' conduct, their own words unmatched by deeds?

Seeing Someone Off

Yesterday I saw someone off, today I see someone off again.
I am one who sees people off day after day.
Pitifully, today I have seen off everyone I know;
On a future day, who will be the one to see me off? <81>

**Summary**

This collection of four short Hanja poems by Han Chun-sŏk (pen name So-p'a) expresses themes of personal introspection, responsibility, and social observation. "Self-Reflection" speaks of recognizing past deceit and vowing future integrity. "Expressing Feelings" emphasizes the fortune of being human and the individual's role in determining their own fate, rejecting passivity. "Impromptu Composition" values virtuous mentors and descendants above all, critiquing scholars whose actions don't align with their words. "Seeing Someone Off" conveys a poignant sense of loneliness and the transient nature of relationships. For historians, these poems offer a glimpse into the mindset of a Korean intellectual in 1935, reflecting on traditional Confucian values (integrity, filial piety, self-cultivation) while expressing personal anxieties about hypocrisy and isolation, potentially colored by the colonial context.

						小坡 韓準錫
自省
人生罪過欺爲大
今是昨非纔覺來
誓余晩節從玆保
請看重磨古鏡開

述感
八萬六千五百春
不爲凡物幸爲人
賢愚貧富皆由我
豈作窮鄕一浪身

偶成
一生樂有賢師父
萬事無如好子孫
如何此世讀書士
觀行居多不副言

送人
昨日送人今送人
我爲日日送人人
可憐今日送人盡
異日人誰送我人＜81＞
＜81-81＞
