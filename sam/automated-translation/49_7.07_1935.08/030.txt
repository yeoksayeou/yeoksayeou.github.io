Emergency Public Notice
						Samch'ŏlli Company Editorial Department

There has been no incident recently that has caused such a great stir in peninsular society as this matter of the multi-faceted dispute involving the two newspapers, Posŏng College Academy (普專 학원), and Chungang High School (中央高普). Therefore, as long as this dispute (紛紏) continues, this magazine, as a public instrument (公器), pledges hereby to strive to reflect the true public opinion and criticism of our society by providing as much page space as needed, for as long as needed, to numerous individuals.

Furthermore, concerning this issue, we initially intended to publish an extra edition of this magazine (本誌號外), but because the incident progressed moment by moment, there was no opportunity to bring it to a conclusion. After now surveying the entire process up to today, we are publishing it collectively in this August issue of the magazine. We ask for your understanding on this point.

**Summary**

This editorial notice from *Samch'ŏlli* magazine informs readers about a major ongoing controversy involving two newspapers and two prominent Korean educational institutions, Posŏng College and Chungang High School. The editors declare their commitment to covering the dispute extensively, positioning the magazine as a public forum ("public instrument") dedicated to reflecting diverse societal opinions and criticisms. They also explain the delay in coverage, stating that an initial plan for an extra issue was superseded by the need to present a comprehensive overview in the current August issue due to the rapidly unfolding nature of the events.

For historians, this piece is significant as it demonstrates a Korean magazine's active engagement with contemporary social conflicts during the Japanese colonial period. It underscores the perceived role of the press as a shaper and reflector of public opinion ("public instrument") and highlights the tensions surrounding major Korean educational institutions and their interactions with the media landscape of the time, potentially hinting at underlying political or social friction within colonial society.
