感謝와 謝罪

□ Even if only the water's edge (緣水) is good, we hope that all you esteemed readers (諸賢서) are spending the Sambok (三伏) season in a place where blue mountains also stand, amidst health and pleasure, and that we may meet again along with the Song of the Autumn Wind in the Ninth Month (九月秋風辭).

□ The "Ch'unwŏn Complete Works" (春園全集) by the literary giant (文豪) has been slightly delayed due to the printing house's efficiency (能率문에), but its first distributed volume (第一回配本), "That Woman's Life" (그女子의 一生), has come out and is truly raising the price of paper in Luoyang (洛陽의 地價). We will promptly send out the second volume as well, and hope for the wide readership (愛讀) of all esteemed persons (諸氏).

□ We thank you for reading the July issue of Samch'ŏlli so avidly. Please view the August issue, despite the difficulty of editing during the summer days, as acceptable for having achieved this much quality (收護). However, now as we face the September issue during autumn when the sky is high and the horses are fat (天高馬肥), starting from the upcoming September issue, this magazine intends to proceed in earnest (本格的) and strive to create a good "Samch'ŏlli" that does not fall short of (어그러지지안은) your expectations. <300>

**Summary**

This editorial postscript from the August 1935 issue of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine expresses gratitude to readers for their support of the previous issue and apologizes for publication delays, particularly concerning the popular "Ch'unwŏn Complete Works." The editors acknowledge the challenges of producing the magazine during the summer heat but promise a higher quality, more substantial issue starting in September, invoking autumnal imagery. For historians, the piece offers a glimpse into the practical challenges of publishing (printing efficiency) in colonial Korea, highlights the significant cultural impact of literary figures like Yi Kwangsu (Ch'unwŏn), and demonstrates the editorial tone and relationship with readers common in periodicals of that era.
