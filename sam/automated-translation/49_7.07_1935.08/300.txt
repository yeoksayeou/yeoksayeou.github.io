**Summary**

This installment of "Samch'ŏlli Cartoons" presents four short, four-panel comics under the running title "Record of Development Under Wife's Care/Rule." Each comic humorously depicts wives navigating situations involving their husbands, often portrayed as incompetent or needing management. Themes include wives finding ways to benefit financially from lessons intended for their husbands, restraining runaway husbands, discovering husbands in absurd situations (like hiding in a trash can), and the potential social consequences of husbands' interactions with friends. For historians, these comics offer a glimpse into popular representations of marital dynamics and gender roles in 1930s colonial Korea. They reflect changing social norms or anxieties, portraying wives in active, sometimes controlling roles, alongside depictions of everyday life elements like music lessons, night markets, and specific occupations like dung collection, providing social commentary through humor.
