What Benefit Does It Give to the World?
						By Sin Hŭng'u

Regarding this recent matter, I do not know the detailed causes, but I saw the editorials and articles appearing in the newspapers, and also the statement from the Alumni Association's side (校友會側); based solely on those, it seems unlikely to be sufficient grounds for a fight. If one looks only at the reasons revealed on the surface, one cannot help but consider them exceedingly weak to be seen as a serious issue.

□

In the first place, how many cultural institutions do we have left today? At best, there are only a few schools, three or four newspaper companies, and so forth—what else is there? Moreover, unlike in the old days, what is there for a Korean vocational school principal (專門學校長) to do now? Apart from following a fixed timetable and handling severely constrained school administration, what exciting work is there, other than carrying around a name card (名卸) with that job title written on it when going out into society? Wouldn't a principal also need something stimulating to find the role worthwhile? That is why I think there is no position as dull (無味한) as today's school principal, and I believe it is necessary for those on the outside (밧갓헤서는) to understand (諒解) this state of mind.

□

Among these, although also subject to various restrictions, it is the newspaper companies that relatively have some room for free activity, yet even that is likely not such a significant matter. Therefore, when it comes to "our institutions," despite being in a position (處地) where we should sympathize with and protect (疪護) one another, if we divide our weak strength into three or four paths and fight amongst ourselves, what will be left in the end?

I wish this argument, which leaves nothing beneficial to the world by fighting, would be quickly withdrawn.

**Summary**

Sin Hŭng'u expresses dismay over a public dispute, likely between a Korean school/alumni association and a newspaper. He argues the stated reasons seem trivial and laments the extremely limited number and scope of Korean cultural institutions (schools, newspapers) under Japanese rule. He points out the frustrating lack of meaningful agency for figures like school principals. He strongly urges the feuding parties to reconcile, emphasizing that infighting among the few remaining, already constrained Korean organizations is self-destructive and brings no benefit (所益) to society. For historians, the article offers insight into the constrained environment for Korean cultural and educational activities in the mid-1930s, the sense of frustration among Korean elites regarding their limited roles, and the plea for unity among Koreans facing colonial pressures. The mention of the dullness of a principal's job due to restrictions is particularly revealing of the colonial context.

나는 이번일에대하여는 자세한 原因을 모름니다만은 新聞紙上에 나는 社說과 記事와  校友會側의 聲明書를 보앗는데 그것만가지고는 싸홈의 材料가 되지안을것갓습데다. 表面에 나타난 理由만 가지고보면 重大問題로보기에는 甚히 薄弱하다고 아니할수 업스니,

대체 오늘날 우리 文化機關이 몃개나 나머잇습니. 겨우 잇데야 學校몃개 新聞社三四處等等이것밧게 무에잇슴니. 그런데 녯날과도 달너 지금에이르러는 朝鮮사람 專門學校長이 무슨할일이 잇습니 定하여진 時間表를 고 몹시 좁아진 學校行政을 할 社會에나가서 名卸에 그 職號를 써가지고 다니는 것外에 무슨「신」이나는일이라고 잇서야 校長도 할맛이잇슬것아님니 그러기에 나는 오늘의 學校長처럼 無味한노릇이업다고 생각하는덴 밧갓헤서는 그 心境을 諒解해줄 必要가 잇다고 생각하며

그중에도 여러 가지 制限은 밧으면서 亦是新聞社가 比較的 自由로운 活動을할 餘地가 잇는터인데 그亦 그리 大端한 일이아닐것이외다 그러기에 우리의 機關이라하면 서로서로 同情하고 疪護할 處地임에 不拘하고 弱한힘을 세길네길 서로갈너내어으면 나종에 무어 남겟슴니
싸와서 世上에남는 것이 업는 이번 論爭만은 하로 急히 거두워주웟스면 조켓슴니다
