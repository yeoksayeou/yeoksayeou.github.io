Article Title: 全體일과 何關인곳 (What Relevance Has It to the Whole?)
Author: 權東鎭
Article Type: 논설 (Editorial/Opinion Piece)

Let us keep our eyes on the big picture. Let us think about the whole, and let us think about the future, ten years, even one hundred years from now. When we thus broaden the scope of the problem and think about it, fighting within the same fence, arguing over who is right and who is wrong, is what can be called a fight on the horns of a bull (牛角上). If one wins, how much is won? If one gains, how much is gained? And even if one wins and gains, what joy is there? As I am not fully aware of the details regarding the attitude of the press organs this time and the handling of matters before and after by the Posŏng College authorities, I cannot add criticism. However, in essence, Posŏng College (普成專門) is an institution for nurturing talent in which our people place much hope. If there were a great error unacceptable to society at large, they should be duly punished (膺懲), but this recent matter is truly trivial and minor (些少輕微). Applying excessive censure by writing (筆誅) seems like the *Chosŏn Ilbo*'s initial attitude went too far. At the same time, from the perspective of the Posŏng College Alumni Association (普專校友會), making overly harsh resolutions that touch upon the authority of the press organs and publishing them in the newspapers is, I think, also going too far. Be it Posŏng College, the *Chosŏn Ilbo*, the *Tonga Ilbo*, the *Chungang Ilbo*, Yonhŭi College (延專), or Ewha College (梨專), all these cultural institutions are ones that we Korean people cherish equally. All are precious; there is no reason to strike one and blame another. If we strive to expose each other's weaknesses, our society will become a field of weeds (쑥밧), and none of our institutions will be able to fully establish themselves. Considering this, Mr. Kim Sŏngsu (金性洙氏), after taking charge of Posŏng College, has built new buildings, and the foundation is reportedly nearing completion. He is a person with many contributions to the world of education since his time at Chungang School (中央學校). Mr. Kim is someone to be thanked through education. As for Mr. Pang Ŭngmo (方應謨氏), he has built the *Chosŏn Ilbo* into the great newspaper it is today, adding great light to our national culture. Mr. Pang is someone we should thank through the press world. If these two individuals, authorities in their respective fields, could now cooperate well together, that would truly be what we hope for daily, and a joyful thing.
And on this occasion, I wish to state one opinion: it would be good if the private newspaper companies organized something like an association for mutual friendship (親睦), creating opportunities for fellow journalists to constantly critique social conditions and foster harmony (親和).<55>

**Summary**

The author, Kwŏn Tongjin, urges restraint and perspective regarding a recent conflict between Posŏng College (likely involving its alumni association) and the *Chosŏn Ilbo* newspaper. He argues that infighting among cherished Korean cultural institutions over minor issues harms the collective national interest and future. He praises the contributions of both Kim Sŏngsu (Posŏng College head) and Pang Ŭngmo (*Chosŏn Ilbo* head) and calls for their cooperation. Kwŏn suggests that private newspapers form an association to promote mutual understanding and constructive critique among journalists. From a historical perspective, this article is interesting as it reflects the internal tensions and fragile solidarity among Korean nationalist elites operating within the constraints of colonial rule. It highlights the importance placed on institutions like private schools and newspapers as centers of national identity and cultural development, and the desire among some figures to maintain unity despite disagreements, likely aware of the precariousness of their position under Japanese oversight.

우리는 눈에 大局에 두옵시다. 全體일을 생각할바요 十年, 百年의 將來일지 생각하옵시다. 이러케 問題의 範圍를 널퍼노코 생각할 한울타리안에서 네가오르니 내가 그르니 云云하고싸우는 것이 可謂와 牛角上의 싸홈이라 勝하면 얼마나 勝하고 利하면 얼마나 利하리요  勝하고 利한들 무엇이 快하리요 余는 今番 言論機關의 態度와 普專當局의 前後處事에 對하야는 一一히 進相을 詳知치못함으로 批評을 加할수업스나 要컨대 普成專門은 우리 同族이 希望을 만히두는 人材養成의 機關이라 크게 社會에 容納못할 過誤가 有하다면 그들 膺懲할것이로되 今番事는 實로 些少輕微한일로 너무 筆誅를 加한 것은 朝鮮日報의 처음 態度가 度를 지난듯하엿스며 그와 同時에 普專校友會로 보아도 言論機關의 權威에 關連되도록 지나치는 決議를하여 新聞에 發表한다는 等은 너무 甚한일이라고 생각함니다. 普專이나 朝鮮日報나 東亞日報 中央日報나 延專 梨專이나 모다 이모든 文化機關은 우리 朝鮮사람들이 다 한글가치 愛護하는 機關인데 다 所重하야 어느것을치고 어느것을 나무랄것이라고업는데 서로 弱點을 暴露식혀노키여 힘쓴다할진대 우리 社會는 쑥밧히 될것이요 우리 機關은 어느것이나 完全히 기터갈것이 업슬것이외다 생각건대 金性洙氏가 普專을 마튼뒤집도 새로지엇고 財團도 完成되어 간다하며, 自中央學校以來 敎育界에 功勞만흔분이라, 金氏는 敎育을 通하야 感謝할분이요 方應謨氏로말하면 朝鮮日報를 今日의 大로 만들어노아 民族文化에 큰빗츨 加햇스니 方氏는 言論界를 通하야 우리들이 感謝할분이외다 兩方面의 權威인 兩氏가 이제서로 잘 提携하여나가준다면 그는실로 우리가 平日바라는바요, 깃분일로 생각함니다.
그리고 이 機會에 한가지 意見을 述코저함은 民間잇는 新聞社가 서로 親睦을 爲한 機關가튼 것을 組織하여 가튼 言論人으로서 恒常 社會情勢에 對한 不斷의 批評과 親和할 機會를 만들어가짐이 조흘줄아옵니다.＜55＞
