Advocating the Revival of the Mumyŏnghoe
						Yi Chongnin

The Mumyŏnghoe (Nameless Society) was founded about a dozen years ago and encompassed all those engaged in the world of speech within Peninsular society, including newspaper and magazine personnel, boasting five or six hundred members, and its influence was also greatly celebrated. Moreover, when the All-Chosŏn Journalists Conference was held under the auspices of the Mumyŏnghoe, four or five hundred newspaper journalists from the Thirteen Provinces gathered and strove for the expansion and improvement of the press.

While this society held sway in the center, it dealt with resolving disputes between newspaper companies, defended the rights of press figures who were unjustly violated (蹂■當한), and so forth; it seemed that social justice at the time was largely protected by the hands of the Mumyŏnghoe.

However, afterward, due to unfavorable times and various internal circumstances, it has now fallen into a dormant state, almost as if it exists and yet does not. At this juncture, we wish to advocate anew for the revival of the Mumyŏnghoe.

□

As you know, an atmosphere deeply lamentable to newspaper society is flowing today, and this atmosphere is one phenomenon that appears whenever society flows towards a low point. Even the most brilliant person in charge of an institution is too preoccupied with looking only at their own institution and lacks the strength to reflect upon the whole.

It would be good if the Mumyŏnghoe always focused on the whole, viewed all problems from a broad perspective, and became an institution that exerts itself for the improvement of Chosŏn's press world.

□

Regarding a concrete plan for the revival of the Mumyŏnghoe, I intend to state my opinions in more detail on another day, but at this moment, as the world of speech is so chaotic (粉騷하기), I have drafted these few lines while reminiscing about the days when the Mumyŏnghoe existed. <62>

**Summary**

The author, Yi Chongnin, argues for the revival of the Mumyŏnghoe (Nameless Society), a once-influential organization of Korean journalists founded about a dozen years prior to 1935. He recalls its past achievements, such as uniting hundreds of journalists, resolving inter-company disputes, and defending press members' rights, thereby upholding social justice. Contrasting this with the current "lamentable" and fragmented state of the press world, Yi proposes that a revived Mumyŏnghoe could provide a unified perspective, focusing on the overall improvement of journalism in colonial Korea. For historians, this article is interesting as it reflects the desire among Korean intellectuals for professional solidarity and self-regulation within the press under Japanese colonial rule, hinting at both internal conflicts within the Korean media landscape and the external pressures contributing to its decline ("unfavorable times"). It underscores the perceived need for a collective body to navigate the challenges faced by the Korean press during this period.

無名會의 復活을 提唱
						李鍾麟
無名會는 지금부터 約十數年前 創立되야 半島社會에서 言論界에 從事하는 新聞雜誌關係者를 全部網羅하야 會員數五六百을 算하엿고 聲勢한 크게 치엇다. 더구나 無名會主催로 全朝鮮記者大會가 開催되엿슬에는 十三道로부터 各新聞記者 四五百이 會合하야 言論擴張과 그 向上에 努力하엿든 것이다.
이 會가 中央에 雄據하여잇스면서 그동안 新聞社對新聞社間의 紛糾解決에 當하엿다든지, 不當하게 蹂■當한 言論界人士에 對하야 그 權利를 擁護하며 이러나는둥, 當時 社會의 正義는 無名會의 손에 依하야 만히 守護되는듯하엿다
그러더니, 그뒤 時世의 不利와 自體內部의 여러 가지 關係로 今日에 至하여는 거지반 잇는 듯 업는 듯 沈息狀態에 지고말엇는데 이를 當하야 吾人은 다시 無名會의 復活을 提唱코저한다.
□
아시다십히 今日은 新聞社會에 甚히 痛歎할 空氣가 흐르고 잇는데 이 空氣는 恒常 社會가 低調에 흐를에 나타나보이는 現象의하나이다, 한 機關을 마튼이는 아모리 聰明한이라도 自己機關을 바라보기에만 急하엿지 全體을 省察할 힘을 缺한다.
無名會는 恒常 全體에 着眼하야, 모든 問題를 大局에서 바라보며, 朝鮮의 言論界 向上을 爲하야 盡力하는 機關이 되엇스면 조켓다.
□
無名會의 復活에 對한 具體案은 다른날좀더 詳細한 意見陳述을 하고저하거니와 이지음, 言論社會가 하도 粉騷하기, 녯날 無名會의 存在時節을 回想하는 나머지 數句를 草하엿노라＜62＞
