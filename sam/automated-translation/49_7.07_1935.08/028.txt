Keep the Public Pledge to the Masses
						Hwang Uk

Regarding the recent conflict between the Chosŏn Ilbo and the Tonga Ilbo, I did not have much interest. The reason is that currently, regardless of which private Korean newspaper it is, they have all turned their backs on the promises the masses anticipated. To put it bluntly and directly, Korean newspaper organizations have shrewdly become subordinate to the modern economic structure, transforming into a kind of commercial transaction office, and their product, the newspaper, has become completely commodified. In a society of commodity production, staging market scrambles to sell more of one's own product or engaging in free competition for the pursuit of enormous profits is already a matter of common sense; in short, it must be the breakdown of self-contradiction. However, the recent Chosŏn versus Tonga incident, while not comprehensive in its aspect, likely contains various kinds of causal relationships within it. Looking generally at the facts revealed on the surface, the Chungang High Common School student incident mentioned in the June 7th Chosŏn Ilbo editorial and the issue of dealing with Posŏng College entrance students seem to be at its center.<64> Here is what I briefly observe:

Firstly, regarding the Chungang High Common School student incident, without waiting for a third party's answer, unless the school authorities are completely brazen-faced, their hearts must ache, and I believe the pangs of conscience must be very severe. Having nurtured their own students for three or four years with all sincerity and effort, concentrating much expectation and deep affection, they, unable to overcome momentary emotions, ultimately disregarded the bond between teacher and student, the morality of educators, and the dignity of the school authorities without any hesitation, heartlessly sending them off behind iron bars (鐵窓餞送). What must their state of mind be? Yet, even up to this moment, not even a sign of reflection or remorse is visible, which is truly deplorable.

Secondly, regarding the Posŏng College entrance students as well, I do not know how the concerned school authorities will respond, but it is an undeniable regret that this fact is entirely contrary to the fundamental spirit we hoped for from Posŏng College, especially with the completion of the new school building, when the school authorities claimed they were striving for the sake of alleviating admission difficulties, even at the cost of sacrifice. Thus, the Chosŏn Ilbo editorial in question, while keenly feeling the difficulty of accommodating admitted students, a hidden danger in the current Korean educational world, also expresses a kind of distress, thinking, "How could this possibly happen?" when the so-called issue of dealing with students admitted beyond capacity unexpectedly arose from Posŏng College, from which expectations had always been deeper than anywhere else. Also, no matter the reality of facing restrictions on speech, isn't it too much self-abandonment for a newspaper not to be able to express even this much distress? Furthermore, if it concerns facts related to Posŏng College's internal administration, the school affairs authorities still exist and should naturally handle it, so what is the reason for the Alumni Association (校友會) to voluntarily step forward first? It raises much suspicion whether it is to resolve the issue properly or to complicate the incident. In any case, while their sincerity in loving their alma mater can be understood, it is a severe contradiction for the Alumni Association to take such an attitude when the school authorities remain silent. I think perhaps they were agitated by handling the issue in a manner more exaggerated than the facts warrant.

Thus, the aforementioned Chungang High Common School incident and the Posŏng College issue seem to be the current points of contention. Looking at the opposing parties in this incident, it is Chosŏn Ilbo versus Chungang High Common School and Posŏng College; in terms of nature, it is interpreted as concerning educational administration. However, the reality is the opposite, being called a conflict between Chosŏn Ilbo and Tonga Ilbo, which is truly a bizarre incident. Generally, the Tonga Ilbo, as much as it is a product of Kimi (1919), deeply ingrained in our memory, indeed made considerable promises to the masses. However, in recent times, it has cast off even such meaningful promises like an old shoe. While walking its own path, it always claims to be "the Korean nation," "twenty million compatriots," "friend of the masses," and so on, which has already deepened the masses' antipathy and intensified their resentment and anger—this is an undeniable fact. Furthermore, in reporting, which is part of a press organization's duty, forgetting fairness or being biased due to personal connections (私情) would be truly deplorable. This point will likely be proven by the articles concerning the Chungang High Common School student incident and the Posŏng College issue published in the Chosŏn Ilbo this time, so there is no need to say more. No matter how difficult the management circumstances <65> or personal connections may be, and even if consideration for the manager's feelings is difficult, public is public, and private is private. If one becomes absorbed in maintaining an individual's face or wildly engages in private advocacy for one organization, it is truly outrageous. More hectic than that is the tendency amidst the conflict between the two newspapers to hang out the calling cards of prominent figures (名士) and busy oneself pursuing self-interest (我利追求), or the household quarrel-like fights, deviating from public discourse (公論), about being worth 350,000 won or 500,000 won, and the various strange phenomena appearing in the newspaper pages, such as personal attacks using representations hated from before. This is the expression of personal grudges (私憾); if a so-called public battle (公戰) for public discourse becomes a private feud (私鬪) coveting self-interest (自利), it is an incomparably shameful thing.<66>

**Summary**

Hwang Uk critiques the escalating conflict between the Chosŏn Ilbo and Tonga Ilbo newspapers, arguing it exemplifies how Korean newspapers have abandoned their public duty, becoming commercialized entities driven by profit and market share rather than public service. He uses the controversial reporting (by Chosŏn Ilbo) of incidents at Chungang High Common School and Posŏng College, and Tonga Ilbo's reaction, as evidence. Hwang condemns the schools' handling of the students, Posŏng Alumni Association's interference, and especially Tonga Ilbo's alleged hypocrisy—betraying its nationalist origins (from the 1919 Kimi movement) and engaging in biased reporting, personal attacks, and self-interested feuds disguised as public discourse. For historians, this article offers a contemporary critique of the Korean press under colonialism, revealing internal rivalries, the pressures of commercialization clashing with nationalist ideals, and the complex interplay between media, educational institutions, and public opinion during a period of significant social and political constraint. It highlights the disillusionment some intellectuals felt towards established nationalist outlets like the Tonga Ilbo.

						黃郁
이번 朝鮮日報對東亞日報相爭事件에 對하여서는 別로 큰 關心을가지지안었음니다 그 理由로는 現下朝鮮民間新聞이란 그어느것을 不問하고 모다 民衆이 企待하던 約束을둥젓다는것이외다 이를 禮辭없이 單刀直入的으로말하면 朝鮮新聞機關이란어느듯 機敏하게도 現代經濟機構에 從屬되야 一種의 商業收引所로 變하얏고 그 生産品인 新聞紙는 完全히 商品化되얏다는말이외다 商品生産社會에있어서 自家商品을 더 販賣하기 爲하야 市場爭奪戰을 演出하거나 또는 莫大한 利潤의 追求를 爲하야 自由競爭쯤하는 것은 벌서 常識問題이니요 要컨대 自體矛盾의 破綻일것임니다 그런데 이번 朝鮮對東亞事件은 그 事像이 全面的이아님과 共히 그 裡面에는 種種樣樣의 因果關係가 內包되고있을것이나 大體表面에드러난 一部의 事實을보게되면 六月七日朝鮮日報社說에씨워있는 中央高普學生事件과 普專入學生處分問題가그中心인듯함니다 이에＜64＞ 나의 보는바를 간단히 記한다면이러힘니다
첫재로 中央高普學生事件에 對하야는 第三者의 答案을기다리지아니하고 學校當局者로서도 鐵面皮가아닌 以上엔 가슴이아릴것이며 良心上苛責이매우 甚할줄로암니다 自己들손으로온갓 精誠과 온갖 努力을다하야 三四年間길너오면서 많은 期待와 깊을 愛情을 集中하고있던 自己生徒를 一時的感情에 못익여서 結局은 師弟間分義도 敎育者의 道德도 學校當局의 體面도 아모 忌憚없이 不顧하고 無心하게 鐵窓餞送하얏으니 그들 心相이엇더켓슴니가? 그러나 이 時間까지도 아모련 反省과 의 徵候조차 뵈이지아니하니 참으로 寒心千萬이외다.
둘재로 普專入學生도 該校當局은 엇더케 對答할넌지몰으겟슴니다만은 우리가바라던 普專으로서 더욱히 新校舍의 落成과 共히 學校當局이희생하고라도 入學難을 爲하야 努力하노라고하던 根本精神과난 全然背馳된 事實인것임은 속힐 수 없는 遺憾이외다 이에서 問題되고있는 朝鮮日報社說도 現下朝鮮敎育界에 難關的暗碓인 入學生收容難을 痛感하는 他一面에 平素불어 어대보담도 企待가깊은 普專으로불어 所謂入學超過生處分問題가 意外에 發生케되니가 『참아이럴수가있느냐』하는 一種의 苦東인줄암니다 또아모리 言論의 束練을 當하고있는 現實에선들 新聞으로서 이만한 苦衷도 發表치못한다는 것은 너무나 自暴自棄가아니겟슴니가? 그리고 普專校內行政에 關한 事實이라고하면 校務當局이 依然히 存在하고 또 當然히 處理할것임에도 不拘하고 校友會가몬저 自進奮起하는 理由는어댓잇는지요 問題를 正當히 解決하기 爲함인지 事件을 紛糾식히기 爲함인지 많은 疑心을 거처줌니다 何如間母校를 사랑하는 誠意는 諒解할수있으나 學校當局은 아못말없는데 校友會가 이런 態度를 取한 것은 甚한 矛盾임니다 그들은 아마도 問題를 事實以上의 過大한 取扱에서 興奮되지안엇는가하고 생각함니다.
그리하야우에말한 中央高普事件과 普專問題가 至今問題되고있는모양인데 이 事件의 對手方으로본다면 朝鮮日報對中央高普及普專이오 性質로본다면 敎育行政에 關한 것으로 解釋됨니다 그러나 事實은 그와 反對로 朝鮮日報對東亞日報相爭이라하니 참으로 奇恠한 事件임니다 大抵東亞日報는 우리들의 記憶에 깊은 己未의 産物인마콤 實로적지아니한 期待를 民衆과 約束하얏슴니다만은 晩近以來로 그러한 意味깊은 約束도 헌신짝갗이버서바리고 自己는 自己갈거름을 거르면서도 言必稱曰朝鮮民族이니 日二千萬同胞이니 日民衆의 親友이니 云云하는데서 벌서불어 民衆의 反感이깊엇고 怨怒가 激仰되고있은 것은 속히지못할 事實이지요 더욱히 言論機關의 一部的任務인 報道에있어서 正當性을 忘却한다거나 私情에 偏한다면 참으로 酸鼻할일이지요 이点이아마 今次朝鮮日報에 記載된 中央高普學生事件과 普專問題에 關한 記事가 實証할터이니 더말할 必要도없겟지요 아모리 經營上情實＜65＞關係가있고 經營者의 面情이어렵다한들 公은 公이오 私는 私인 以上 一個人의 體面維持에 沒頭하거나 一個機關의 私的大辯에 亂舞한다면 참으로 言語道斷이지요 그보담더 奔走한 것은 兩報相爭中에 名士의 呼牌를내걸고 我利追求에 奔走하는 傾向이라거나 公論을떠나서 三十五萬圓자리니 五十萬圓자리니하는 살님싸홈같은것이며 平素불어 憎惡하엿던 表像으로 個人攻격等等恠現狀이 種種紙面에나타나는것임니다 이는 私憾의 發露인데 所謂여 論을 爲한 公戰이라면서 自利를 貪하는 私鬪가된다면 참 自愧無比한일임니다.＜66＞
