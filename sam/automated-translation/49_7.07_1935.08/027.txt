Attacking the Private Profit-Seeking Nature of a Public Instrument
						By Yi Yŏng

Regarding the recent dispute between the *Chosŏn Ilbo* and the *Tong-a Ilbo*, I think its true nature is still unclear. Why is that? According to recent reports circulating in the papers, the crux of the issue stems from the *Chosŏn Ilbo*'s brief critique concerning the Chungang High School student incident and its discussion of the Posŏng College student admission disciplinary action problem. If these were the only issues, then the true nature of the so-called dispute would clearly refer to the *Chosŏn Ilbo* versus Chungang High School and Posŏng College. However, the public generally points to it as a dispute between the *Chosŏn Ilbo* and the *Tong-a Ilbo*, which is strange at first glance, but also clearly indicates that there is a subtle chain of connection here.

First, the Chungang High School student incident is an event known to everyone at the time, so there is no need to reiterate its details. However, the school authorities must absolutely reflect responsibly. If the school authorities lack such awareness, then even the powerful figures managing the school should take disciplinary action. After taking charge of raising other people's precious children for three or four years with their own hands, they ultimately ended up sending them to prison due to a momentary excitement. As human beings, how can the school authorities face the parents or the remaining students? Conceding one step, even if we assume the students' path was improper, from whom did those students receive their education, and who guided them? If they lack such a sense of responsibility, they are truly brazen-faced (鐵面皮).

Second, concerning the Posŏng College issue, it is a fact that, like their current reality, they violated the regulations of the educational authorities (學務當局) in recruiting students, and it is also true that they are accommodating excess students. Moreover, the school authorities also petitioned the educational authorities to realize the student excess, a fact for which everyone would have been grateful for Posŏng College authorities' sincerity. Yet, for what reason did Posŏng College, while outwardly campaigning for increased student numbers, internally adopt a new, unprecedented practice of so-called strict adherence, and deny admission to nearly thirty qualified students under the ambiguous reason of simple procedural incompletion? On this point, I believe some unpublishable contradiction must be latent. It is unavoidable to be surprised that the Posŏng College Alumni Association (校友會) would voluntarily enter into a dispute against the *Chosŏn Ilbo* for discussing this matter. If it were a matter concerning internal school administration, it should naturally be handled by the academic affairs authorities. While the school authorities remained silent and dealt with it appropriately, for the Alumni Association to take such an attitude—whether out of love for the alma mater, to protect the magnate of the foundation (財團), or with the intent to complicate the incident—it might have some rationale in any of these, but the severe contradiction cannot be denied. Lastly, regarding newspapers, I see <63> all private newspapers in Chosŏn as a type of profit-making institution faithfully playing the role of modern capitalist society. Take the *Tong-a Ilbo*, for instance; at the time of its birth, it was a splendid dragon-child of the peninsula. However, once it took the financial king of Chosŏn as its master, it stealthily parted ways with the common people. Due to this relationship, I do not wish to overvalue newspapers as public instruments (公器) for public discourse (公論). However, even for its own profit, a newspaper must achieve fairness in its reporting. Yet, the *Tong-a Ilbo*—whether intentionally or as part of the company's business policy, I do not know—regarding the recent Chungang High School student incident, reported as if the Chungang High School authorities' measures were appropriate, proclaiming to the whole world that the involved students' imprisonment was a natural fact. This is truly outrageous. Of course, given the business chain connection and how various matters are handled under the dictatorship of a single owner, it might seem plausible, but losing fairness even in reporting is excessively irresponsible. Claiming to be a public instrument of society while defending the private affairs of one institution means the newspaper has already abandoned its function and become a dead object. Also, the talk of household finances (살님사리), the so-called 350,000 won or 500,000 won dispute, revealed in the *Chosŏn Ilbo*'s editorial truly gives the impression of children squabbling over their dinner table. I cannot suppress my displeasure when I see such articles. However, I also feel a sense of catharsis (痛快) whenever exposures concerning rights issues or other matters for the masses appear occasionally on the pages of both newspapers. <64>

**Summary**

The author, Yi Yŏng, criticizes the unfolding dispute between the *Chosŏn Ilbo* and the *Tong-a Ilbo*, arguing it stems from the *Tong-a Ilbo*'s biased defense of Chungang High School and Posŏng College (likely linked through shared ownership/management, implied to be Kim Sŏng-su) regarding recent student incidents and controversial admission practices. Yi condemns the school authorities for irresponsibility and the *Tong-a Ilbo* for sacrificing journalistic fairness (public good) for private interests (私利性), lamenting the commercialization of newspapers. He finds the newspapers' public squabble over finances childish but appreciates their occasional exposés benefiting the public. From a historical perspective, the article offers insights into the complex relationships between major Korean institutions (media, education, business conglomerates like the Kim Sŏng-su group) under Japanese rule, highlighting internal conflicts, ethical debates about the role of the press, and the tensions surrounding education policy and student activism within the colonial context. Historians might find the critique of media bias tied to ownership and the specific examples of institutional maneuvering valuable.

나는 이번 朝鮮日報對東亞日報 相爭事件에 對하야 아직그正體가 分明치못하다고 생각함니다 왜그런고하니 近者紙上으로떠도는 報導에 依하면 問題의 要点은 朝鮮日報側에서 中央高普學生事件에 關한 간단한 批判과 普專入學生處分問題를 若干히 論難한것인데 이것만을 問題로삼는다면 所謂相爭云云의 正體는 分明히 朝鮮日報對中央高普及普專을 指稱할것임니다 그러나 一般은 모다 朝鮮日報對東亞日報相爭이라고 指摘하니 于先恠異도하거니와 這間에는 美妙한 連鎖關係가 잇다는 것으로 如實히알겟슴니다.
첫재 中央高普學生事件은 當時世上이다아는 事件임으로 그 內容을 다시말할 必要는 없음니다만은 學校當局은 斷然코 責任잇는 反省이있어야함니다 萬一에 學校當局에서 이러한 覺悟가없다면 當校經營者의 權力的處分이라도있어야하지요 自己들손으로 남의 貴한 子弟를 三四年間말아길너가지고 結局은 一時的興奮에서 刑務所로 收容하고 말엇으니 學校當局도 人間인 以上 무슨 面目으로 學父兄이나 殘餘의 學員들을 對面한단말임니가? 一步를 讓하야 學生의 간거름이 不正當하다고 假定하고라도 그 學生은 누구의게서 敎育을 받엇으며 누구가 敎導하얏씀니가? 責任感이 그러케없다면 그야말로 鐵面皮일것임니다.
둘재 普專問題에있어서는 自身의 現實과 如히 學務當局의 學則에어긔여서 學員募集한것도 事實이오 또 超過生을 收容하고 있는것도 事實임니다 보담도 學校當局은 學員超過의 實現을 爲하야 學務當局에 陳情運動한것도 事實인만치 普專當局의 誠意를 누구나 感謝하얏을것임니다 그런데 무슨 理由로써 普專은 外로 學員增員運動을하면서 內로서는 年例에없는 新貫例로 所謂嚴守主義云云하야가지고 單純히 手續不備라는 瞹眛한 理由로써 三十名에 近한 合格生의게 入學을 不許하얏단말임니가? 이 点에 있어서는 아마도 公開할 수 없는 엇던 矛盾이 潜在할줄아옴니다 이것을 問題삼아 論難한 朝鮮日報에 對하야 普專校友會가 自進相爭한다는 것은 놀나지안을 수 없는 일이외다 校內行政에 關한 事實이라면 敎務當局에서 當然히 處理할 事件이어늘 學校當局은 아못말없이 善處하고 었는데 校友會가 如此한 態度를 取하게되는 것은 母校를 사랑함인지 財團의 巨頭를 擁護함인지 事件을 紛糾식힐 意圖인지 그 어느것에나 一理를 두엇겟지만 矛盾이 甚한것만 否認할수없을것임니다 마즈막으로말할 것은 新聞에 關한것인데 나는 朝＜63＞鮮의 民間新聞이란 모다 現代資本社會의 充實한 役割을하고있는 一種의 營利化한 機關이라고보옴니다 于先東亞日報만하더래도 그 誕生當時에는 훌융한 半島의 龍兒엿소이다 그러나 그가 朝鮮의 財王을 主人으로삼더니 슬그머니 民間과는 갈나지고 말었음니다 이런 關係上新聞이라하야서 公論을 爲한 公器로서 過大한 評價를 내리고는싶지안슴니다 그러나 新聞으로서 自體의 營利를 爲하여서도 報導만은 公正을 得하여야할 것임니다 그런데 東亞日報는 故■로인지 또는 本社의 營業方針인지는 몰으겟슴니다만은 今次中央高普學生事件에 對하여서는 中央高普當局의 處置가 그 宜를 得한 듯이 關係學生群의 刑務所行을 當然한 事實이라고 滿天下에 告白하니 참으로 言語道斷이외다 勿論營業上으로 連鎖關係를 가젓고 經營主一人의 獨裁下에서 諸般事가 料理되는이 만치그럴듯도 하지만은 報導에까지 公正을 失한다는 것은 너무나 無責任한 일이며 稱曰社會의 公器라고하면서 一個機關의 私情을 爲하야 辯護한다는 것은 新聞으로서벌서 自己職能을 抛棄하고 한個의 死物이된것이외다 또 朝鮮日報의 社說에드러난 所謂三十五萬圓이니 五十萬圓이니하는 살님사리도틈이란참으로 어린애들의 밥床도틈의 感이없지안슴니다 나는 이러한 記事를 볼에는 不快함을 禁할수없어요 만은각금 兩新聞紙의 紙面에 利權問題라거나 其他大衆을 爲한 暴露가 있을는 또 痛快도 늣기고 있음니다.＜64＞
