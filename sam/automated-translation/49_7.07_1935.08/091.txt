One, If there is not yet a "Samch'ŏlli" Branch Office (支社) or Sales Outlet (販賣所) in your locality (貴地), please make every effort (盡力) to establish one, Sir/Teacher (先生서). (If you request the internal regulations (內規) for operating a branch office, which is profitable (利益) and requires no security deposit (保證金), we will present (進呈) them to you.)

Two, When sending money (送金), if you send it via Postal Transfer Savings (振替貯金), it will be credited (入金) without fail (틀님업시). If the magazine does not arrive (到着) within twenty days after sending the money, it means it was lost in transit (中途粉失). In that case (그는), please send a letter (便紙) to the Head Office (本社) stating "Magazine Not Received" (冊不着), and we will investigate and reship (調査再送) it to you.

Samch'ŏlli Business Bureau <105>

**Summary**

This is an urgent notice from the *Samch'ŏlli* magazine's business bureau to its readers in 1935. It encourages readers to help establish local branches or sales points, highlighting that it's profitable and requires no security deposit, offering to provide internal guidelines upon request. It also instructs readers on the preferred payment method (postal transfer) and the procedure to follow if the magazine fails to arrive after payment, assuring investigation and reshipment. For historians, this notice offers insight into the business operations and distribution strategies of a prominent Korean cultural magazine during the Japanese colonial period. It reveals the practical challenges (like mail loss) and methods (like using postal transfers and recruiting local agents) involved in expanding readership and maintaining circulation under colonial constraints.
