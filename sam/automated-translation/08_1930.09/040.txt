The Current State of the Annam Movement
						Pacific Ocean Scholar (太平洋學人)

I
We cannot help but pay attention to the fact that in French-controlled Annam, bordering India which is drawing the world's attention, a fierce national movement is currently unfolding.
Originally, French Indochina, if strictly divided, consists of the five countries of Tonkin, Annam, Laos, Cambodia, and Cochinchina. Among these, Cochinchina is a purely French colony, while the others have all become French protectorates. Collectively known as Vietnam (越南), its area is 700,000 square kilometers and its population is 30 million, making it twice the area and one and a half times the population of Chosŏn. France first set its sights (目) on the Annam region 266 years ago (1664),<16> when the French East India Company also entered, concealing its venomous fangs. Through various economic activities, manipulation of old and new kings, and religious proselytization, it eventually expanded its political influence greatly. Finally, using Annam's internal strife as an opportunity, a secret Franco-Annamite treaty was concluded in 1787. In this treaty, France was to supply Annam with 1,200 infantry, 200 artillery, a total of 1,650 troops, and 4 warships. In return, Tourane (Da Nang) was leased to France, and Con Dao Island was ceded (exercising sovereignty, of course), and France acquired special privileges for trade and proselytization within Annamite territory. Later, just as Germany seized Jiaozhou Bay, France, using the persecution of French missionaries as a pretext, mobilized a large army during the time of Napoleon III in 1856 to conquer various territories in Annam. As there was no way to stop this tide-like force of Eastern aggression, another "New Protectorate Treaty" was concluded between the two unequal nations (August 25, 1883).

1. Annam acknowledges French protection and may not communicate with other countries without obtaining the consent of the French Resident Superior stationed in Huế.
2. The Binh Thuan province ("힌즈암" - likely Bình Thuận) of Annam shall be ceded to France.
3. Annam's customs shall be placed under French administration.
Other rights such as stationing troops, establishing telegraph lines, purchasing Annamite warships, etc., were acquired. The fate of Annam was already decided by this treaty. Thus, riding the momentum, in 1887, France combined Cochinchina, Tonkin, Annam, Cambodia, etc., calling it French Indochina, and established a Governor-General to oversee the entire region.

II
So, how did the French deputies govern the Annamites? They initially made the civil service examination style of learning the principle of national education. This involved making children, from the age of six, concentrate solely on this kind of learning, derived from China – dreamlike characters, forest literature – called "Eight-legged essays" (八股文), "Poetry and Rhapsody" (詩賦), "Literary Composition" (詞章), etc., which was extremely detached from reality. This was their "Cultural Policy" (文化政策). Thus, every three years, these beggar-like degenerate scholars were gathered for examinations and awarded the title of "Jinshi" (進士). It goes without saying that this had a great effect in emasculating their spirit.

As the accumulated abuses of this system reached their peak, intellectuals rose up, and it was finally abolished about 10 years ago. However, looking at the new educational policy that followed, even in elementary schools, things like physical education or singing were entirely absent, and the only textbooks available were records praising the splendor and greatness of France. As for the law, it was truly pervasive; the death penalty and life imprisonment were daily occurrences, and hard labor sentences were extreme. Furthermore, under the pretext of internal rebellion crimes, popular movement activists were severely punished; arrests, imprisonment, and executions were possible without any supporting evidence. Reaching the point where "if two or more people consult, this is considered a conspiracy," it was truly beyond<17> words.

How could it stop there? Harsh levies and exactions (苛斂誅求) were also severe. Besides the heavy burden of general public levies, there was a marriage tax for getting married, a funeral tax for holding a funeral when someone died, an entertainment tax for banquets, a livestock tax for domestic animals, and an assembly tax if three or more people gathered. In addition, they sold tasteless tobacco from the Monopoly Bureau, did not prohibit opium, and adopted a closed-door policy with high tariffs – in all aspects, their so-called thoroughness was evident. However, where there is oppression, the freedom movement inevitably arises. Mr. Sonamja Pan Sihan (巢南子潘是漢氏 - Phan Bội Châu), carrying his 64-year-old body, rose energetically. Originally, when Annam finally fell, Mr. Phan, as a 19-year-old youth from the scholar-gentry class, organized and actively led the Loyalist Corps (勤王隊) with young members of the gentry. For the next 40 years, he was a person who, without rest, traveled clandestinely both domestically and abroad to places like Japan and China, engaging in significant activities. (Omitted from original text)

After the Great War, as domestic and external pressure became too severe, many spirited youths gathered in Paris. With Mr. Pan Chujŏng (潘周楨氏 - Phan Chu Trinh) as the central figure, they organized the Annamite Party (安南黨) and became active. From then on, the popular movement expanded and strengthened like a distant wildfire. Examples include the Saigon riots, the attempted assassination of the Governor-General, the movement of 5,000 peasants in Nam Định, the strike (盟罷) of 1,000 workers at the Saigon Arsenal, and this year, between February and March, rebellions arose within the army, bombing incidents by revolutionary party members targeting the Hanoi courthouse, police station, and gendarmerie headquarters, attacks on garrisons in An City (安市 - likely Yên Bái?), the occupation of the Black River ferry crossing (黑河渡船場), the fall of Lam Thao (람다오), arson at the governor's residence, etc. Truly shocking major incidents occurred one after another. Meanwhile, over 1,000 people were imprisoned, and arrests, confinements, and executions became rampant day and night. (Omitted from original text)

III
Now, let me record the recent general trend and lay down this brush. On March 24th, when the trial for the Nam Định Communist Party incident was held at the Hanoi High Court (上審院), with Counselor "Bohlen" (보-렌즈 - likely a French official name, potentially Baurès?) presiding as chief judge, a report on the organization of the Annam independence movement was announced.

That is, the opposition parties opposing French rule in Indochina are divided into various factions based on principles such as national, monarchist, republican, socialist-communist, etc., but all these parties are completely united in their aim to detach Vietnam from French rule and establish a new political system.
Looking at the various factions and parties investigated by the French authorities:

1. Revolutionary Party (革命黨) = This party is a group of all revolutionary activists who have escaped abroad. Its headquarters are in Guangdong, and although it claims to follow Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People (三民主義), it emphasizes the nation and class. All members intend to establish an autonomous government in Vietnam and become independent from ruling authority.
2. Vietnamese Nationalist Party (越南國民黨) = Organized in 1926, a purely monarchist association.
3. Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth League (越南靑年革命同志會) = Has democratic tendencies, but communists still hold sway.<18>
The main headquarters are in Guangdong, where a political school is also established to teach politics and economics to Annamites. There are also many party members studying at the Whampoa Military Academy (黃浦軍官學校).
4. Indochinese Communist Party (東洋共産黨) = Although it is said that it has not yet received recognition from the Comintern (國際共産黨), it is clear that it possesses the characteristics of a communist party. Its party rules are strict, with punishments including the death penalty.
5. Vietnamese Communist Party (越南共産黨) = This association was organized as the fifth party after the Indochinese Communist Party conference.

As indicated by the above announcement, the forces of the Annam independence movement are divided into five factions. Summarizing these, the first aims to enthrone the fallen king and establish a constitutional monarchy; the second aims to elect a president like Turkey (士耳其) and establish a constitutional democracy; the third and following aim to establish communist states following the Soviet Union/Soviet Asia (쏘비엣 西亞), etc.
At this time when the situation in India is drawing extreme attention, where and how is Annam intending to go in the future?<19>

**Summary**

This 1930 article describes the situation in French Indochina (Annam/Vietnam), detailing the history of French colonization starting from the 17th century, culminating in protectorate treaties and direct rule. It harshly criticizes French colonial policies, particularly the "cultural policy" promoting outdated classical studies, the lack of practical education, oppressive laws allowing arbitrary arrests and harsh sentences, and numerous burdensome taxes. The article then chronicles the rise of Vietnamese resistance, highlighting key figures like Phan Bội Châu and Phan Chu Trinh, major incidents like peasant uprisings, worker strikes, and armed revolts in the late 1920s and early 1930. Finally, it outlines the main factions within the independence movement as identified by French authorities: a revolutionary party based abroad, a monarchist party, the influential Revolutionary Youth League (with communist leanings), and two distinct communist parties, all united in seeking independence but differing on the future form of government (monarchy, republic, or communist state).

From the perspective of Korean colonial history, this article is interesting as it reflects a Korean intellectual's view (writing under a pen name) of another Asian nation's anti-colonial struggle during the Japanese occupation of Korea. It provides contemporary Korean readers with a comparative lens on colonial oppression (French vs. Japanese methods) and resistance strategies. The detailed critique of French assimilationist policies, legal abuses, and economic exploitation would have resonated strongly with Koreans experiencing similar conditions under Japan. The discussion of diverse ideological currents within the Vietnamese movement (nationalist, monarchist, democratic, communist) mirrors the complex political landscape of the Korean independence movement itself.

安南運動의 現勢
						太平洋學人
一
世界의 視聽을 끄을고 잇는 저 印度와 接壤하여 잇는 佛蘭西領地 安南에도 방금 바야흐로 猛烈한 民族運動이 展開되고 잇는 것을 吾人은 注意하지 안을 수 업다.
元來 佛領印度支那를 嚴密히 區分하면 東京, 安南, 老檛, 東蒲塞及交趾支那의 5個國인 바 그중에 交趾支那가 純全한 佛國植民地인 以外에 다른 것은 모다 佛蘭西 保護國이 되엇다. 總括하야 通稱 越南이라고 하는바 그 面積은 70萬平方키로메-돌 人口 3,000萬으로 조선에 비하면 面積에 잇서 倍 人口에 잇서 半倍가 만흔곳이다. 처음 佛蘭西가 安南地方에 *目하기는 只今부터 266年前(1664年)으로＜16＞, 亦是 佛國東印度會社가 毒牙를 감추고 드러와 諸種의 經濟的 活動과 新舊王의 操縱과 宗敎의 布敎로 끗을 더 나종에는 크게 政治的 勢力을 펴게 되어 마츰내 安國의 內亂을 一期로 佛安密約을 1787年에 締結케 되엿스니 거기에는 佛蘭西는 安南에 步兵 1,200 砲兵 200 其他 合計 1,650의 兵隊와 軍艦4集을 供給하는 代償으로 泓島를 佛國에 貸與하고 又 昆崙島를 割讓할 것과(勿論 主權도 行事) 佛國 安南領內에 通商 布敎의 特權을 獲得하기로 된 것이엇다. 그 뒤 獨逸이 膠州灣을 略取하드시 佛國人 宣敎師의 迫害를 口實로 佛國은 1856年 나파륜 3世때에 大軍을 動하야 安南諸領을 攻略할새 東洋侵略의 이 怒濤가튼 勢力을 막을 길이 업서 또한 「新保護條約」이 强弱不同한 二國間에 締結(1883年 8月 25日)되엇스니
一. 安南은 佛蘭西의 保護를 承認하고 順化駐剳佛國監督官의 仝意들 엇지 못하면 他國과 交通함을 不得함.
二. 安南領 「힌즈암」을 佛國에 割讓할 일.
三. 安南의 關稅를 佛蘭西의 行政下에 置할 일.
其他 軍隊駐屯, 電線開設, 安南軍艦買收 等의 諸權利를 獲得하엿스니 이미 安南의 大勢는 此條約에서 決定된 것이다. 그리하야 乘勝長驅로 1887年에는 佛國은 交趾支那, 東京, 安南, 東蒲塞 等을 合하야 佛領印度支那라 稱하고 總督을 置하야 全般을 統轄함에 까지 至하엿다.

二
그러면 佛蘭西代官들이 安南人을 엇더케 統治하엿든가. 그네는 처음 科擧式學問敎授로 國民敎育의 宗旨를 삼엇스니 中國서 건너 온 夢遊文字, 山林文學인 曰 「八股文」, 曰 「詩賦」, 曰 「詞章」云云하야 現實과 遊離하기 至極한 此種學問에 六歲부터 專心케 하엿스니 此 「文化政策」이라. 그리하야 3年에 한 번씩 이 거지가튼 腐儒들을 모아 試驗을 보여서 「進士」를 주엇스니 此가 그네의 精神을 去勢함에 잇서 偉大한 攻効가 잇섯슬 것은 더 말할 必要가 업스리라.
積年의 이 弊害가 其極에 達함에 識者의 奮起가 잇서 約 10等前에 겨우 이것이 廢止되엇스나 그러나 그에 繼하는 新敎育方針을 보건대 今番은 小學校라 하여도 体操나 唱歌가튼 것은 全部업고 오직 잇다는 敎科書도 全部 佛蘭西의 華麗* 偉大를 讚歎하는 記錄뿐이엇다. 法律로 말할지라도 實로 無所不至하야 死刑 終身處刑이 朝飯事요 苦役의 類에 이르러선 極度라 할 것이다. 더욱 內亂罪 云云하야 民衆運動者를 酷罰하되 何等依據할 證據업서도 逮捕, 監禁處刑이 可能하고 「2人 以上이 商議하면 此를 陰謀로 본다.」함에 이르러는 實로 言語仝斷에＜17＞ 다할 뿐이엇다.
엇지 여기에 止하라. 苛斂誅求가 又甚하야 一船公課의 重壓은 勿論 結婚하자면 結婚稅, 사람이 죽어 葬禮하자면 葬式稅, 宴會에 宴會稅, 家畜에 家畜稅, 3人 以上 集會하면 集會稅, 그 外에 맛 업는 專賣局煙草을 팔며 阿片을 禁치 안코 高率의 關稅로 鎖國主義를 取하는 등 各 方面 골고로 그 所謂 徹底한 바가 잇슬 뿐이다. 그러나 重壓이 잇는 곳에 自由運動은 또한 必然的으로 이러나는 것이라 巢南子潘是漢氏가 64歲의 老軀를 들고 躍起하엿스니 元來 仝氏는 安南이 最後亡하든 때에 19歲의 靑年으로써 士族靑年들로 勤王隊를 組織活躍하엿고 以後 40年을 寢食이 단 때가 업시 日本, 中國 等 內外地로 潛行하면서 크게 活動하엿든 분이다. (中略-원문)
그 뒤 大戰卽後에는 國內외 强壓이 너무 甚함애 뜻잇는 靑年이 巴里에 만히 모여서 潘周楨氏를 中堅으로 安南黨을 組織하고 活躍하엿고 그제부터는 民衆運動은 遼遠의 火勢로 擴大 强力化하엿스니 卽 「사이곤」의 亂, 總督襲擊事件, 南定農民 5,000의 運動, 사이곤 兵工廠 1,000名 勞働者의 盟罷 그리고 今年에 至하야 2月과 3月사이에 軍隊內에 叛亂이 起하고 革命黨員의 河內 裁判所, 警察署, 憲兵隊에 對한 爆破事件, 安市內의 駐屯隊 襲擊, 東京中部黑河渡船場의 占領, 람다오의 陷落, 知事邸放火 等 實로 耳目을 놀나게 하는 큰 事件이 接踵而起하는 形勢에 이르고 말엇다. 이리하는 한편 1,000餘名은 投獄되엿고 또한 逮捕, 監禁, 處刑이 日夜 盛行함에 至하엿다. (略-원문)

三
이재 最近의 大勢나 記錄하고 이 붓을 노키로 하자. 去 3月24日 河內上審院에서 南定共産黨事件의 裁判이 잇섯슬 때에 顧問官 「보-렌즈」氏를 主席判事로 하고 安南獨立運動에 對한 組織의 報告 發表가 잇섯다.
卽 佛蘭西의 印度支那 痛治에 反對하는 反對黨은 國家, 君主, 共和, 社會共産 等 各 主義에 分派되어 잇스나 이 모든 黨이 越南을 佛國 統治에서 離脫식히어 新政體設立을 企圖하는데는 完全히 一致되어 잇다.
이제 佛國官憲이 調査한 各派各黨을 보건대
一. 革命黨=此黨은 國外에 脫出한 모든 革命運動者의 團體로 本部는 廣東에 置하고 孫文의 三民主義에 遵壉한다고 하나 國家와 階級과를 重히 하고 黨員이 모다 越南에 一個의 自治政府를 樹立하여 統治權에서부터 獨立하려 한다.
二. 越南國民黨=1926年의 組織으로 純粹的 君主主義 結社.
三. 越南靑年革命同志會=民主主義의 傾向이 잇스나 共産主義者가 依然 優勢하다.＜18＞
總本部는 廣東에 置하고 又 同處에 政治學*를 두어 安南人에게 政治經濟學을 가르치고 잇다. 又黃浦軍官學校에 在學하는 仝黨黨員 多數하다.
四. 東洋共産黨=國際共産黨의 承認을 아직 밧지 못 하엿다하나 共産黨의 性質을 뛴 것만은 分明하다. 黨規嚴正하여 死刑으로 罰하는 일이 잇다.
五. 越南共産黨=東洋共産黨會議後에 第5黨으로 組織되어 나온 結社이다.
右發表와 如히 安南獨立運動勢力은 五派에 分하여 잇스나 此를 要約하건대 第一은 만난 왕을 奉하고 입헌군주국으로 하려는 것, 第二는 士耳其모양으로 대통령을 選擧하여 立憲民主國으로 하려는 것 第三 以下는 쏘비엣 西亞에 따른 共産主義國家로 하자는 等이다.
印度의 形勢 極히 注目을 끄으는 이 때 安南은 장차 어듸로 엇더케 가려 하는가?＜19＞
＜16-19＞
