Funny Story (笑話)

It is a well-known fact in the world that there are many beggars (乞人) in Shanghai. The 600-odd beggars between Shanghai and Wusong (吳淞), perhaps because money has dried up there recently due to the economic downturn (不景氣), said their income has decreased compared to before and they are hungry.

Just the other day, they held a grand meeting of 600 beggars (乞人大會) and made a resolution (決議) stating, "Provide three meals a day from now on," which they submitted as a demand to the Nationalist Government (國民政府).

No matter how new the administration (新政) is, perhaps beggars are an exception; it's said they rejected (却下) the resolution, which is certainly a curious (珍奇) thing.＜20＞

**Summary**

This short article humorously reports on a recent event where 600 beggars in the Shanghai-Wusong area of China, facing reduced income due to an economic downturn, held a meeting and formally demanded that the Nationalist Government provide them with three meals a day. The government rejected their demand. From a historical perspective, this piece reveals Korean awareness of specific social conditions and events in contemporary China, including poverty exacerbated by economic hardship and the actions of marginalized groups. It also shows an interest in the responses of the Chinese Nationalist Government, perhaps reflecting broader observations about governance in the region during the colonial period. The slightly amused tone might also hint at attitudes towards social unrest or demands placed on authorities.
