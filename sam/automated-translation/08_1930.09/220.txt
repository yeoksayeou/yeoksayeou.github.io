Explanation of Russia's State Security Department, the "Kke, Be, U" (GPU)

In any country, political offenders, namely those individuals who endanger the existence of that country, are subject to the most <50> severe punishment. In Worker-Peasant Russia (榮農露西亞), too, there is a special high police organization called the "Kke, Ppe, U" (께,뻬,우) for handling these political offenders.

If one were to directly translate the name "Kke, Be, U" (께,베,우), besides State Security Department (國家保安部), it could also be called the State Political Bureau (國家政治局) or the State Affairs Investigation Bureau (國事探偵局). Its main headquarters is located in Moscow (莫斯科), and its branches are spread throughout various places such as Vladivostok (海參威), Khabarovsk (花發浦), and Leningrad (레닌그라드).

The Kke, Be, U was established based on Article 61, Chapter 9 of the national constitution ratified by the 2nd Central Executive Committee (中央執行委員會) of the Soviet Union (쏘비엣聯邦) on July 6, 1923, which states:

"To consolidate the revolutionary efforts of the various republics of the Union in cracking down on political and economic counter-revolutionary movements, espionage (間諜), or banditry (匪賊行動), the Unified State Security Department (聯合國家保安部) (i.e., Kke, Be, U) shall be established under the Soviet Union Council of People's Commissars (쏘비엣聯邦人民委員會議) (which is like the cabinet meeting of foreign countries), and its Security Director shall be entitled to attend and speak at the Council of People's Commissars (人民委員會議)."

Thus, its authority is extremely broad and deep. Furthermore, it possesses military authority, so if, for example, a counter-revolutionary movement arises in some region, it can mobilize a large number of troops to pacify it. Besides that, it goes without saying that it can arrest, imprison, and execute state offenders or individuals who harm the maintenance of the socialist state (社會主義國家) system at any time.

However, since the Kke, Be, U is not directly a judicial organ, it is said that it must report to the judicial authorities after carrying out executions.

The members of the Kke, Be, U wear green hats and collar insignia <51>, and their Western-style uniforms are khaki ("가-끼") colored. It is beyond doubt that there are many indirect members in factories, government offices, hotels, and various other places.

In any case, in the current construction phase of Russia, the police network of the Kke, Be, U is completely spread everywhere, having safely managed and passed through the chaotic period of the past, and it seems poised to staunchly protect revolutionary Russia going forward as well. <52>

**Summary**

This article describes the Soviet Union's state security apparatus, known colloquially in the text as "Kke, Be, U" (GPU/OGPU), established in 1923. It details the organization's legal basis, its headquarters in Moscow, branches in major cities like Vladivostok and Leningrad, and its broad powers, including military authority, to suppress counter-revolution, espionage, and banditry. The article notes its ability to arrest, imprison, and execute political offenders, although it must report executions post-facto. It also mentions the distinctive green and khaki uniforms of its members and the pervasiveness of its network, concluding that this organ was crucial for stabilizing the Soviet state during its formative years and would continue to protect it. For historians studying colonial Korea, this piece offers insight into how the neighboring Soviet Union and its powerful internal security forces were perceived and reported on during the Japanese occupation. It reflects an awareness of the consolidation of communist power and the methods used, potentially viewed with a mixture of interest and apprehension.

기사형태	소식

露西亞의 國家保安部 「께, 베, 우」解說
엇든 나라든지 政治犯 卽 그 나라의 存在를 危殆케 하는 人物에 對하여는 가장＜50＞ 嚴罰하는 터인데 榮農露西亞에서도 이 政治犯의 處置를 爲하야 「께,뻬,우」라는 特別施設의 高等警察機關이 잇다.
께,베,우라는 일홈을 直譚한다면 國家保安部 外에 國家政治局 또는 國事探偵局이라고도 부를 수 잇서서 總本部는 莫斯科에 두고 海參威, 花發浦, 레닌그라드 等 各處에 그 가지가 널니어 잇다.
께베우는 1923年 7月 6日 쏘비엣聯邦 第2回 中央執行委員會에서 裁可한 同國憲法 第9章 第61條에 依하야 된 것으로 卽
「政治的 並 經濟的 反革命運動이나 間諜 又는 匪賊行動의 取締에 對한 聯邦 各 共和國의 革命的 努力을 結合하기 爲하야 쏘비엣聯邦人民委員會議(卽 外國의 內閣會議와 갓다)의 아래에 聯合國家保安部(卽 께,베,우)를 置하고 그 保安部長은 人民委員會議에 列席하야 發言함을 得함」
이라 하야 그 權限이 매우 넓고 깁다. 더구나 兵力의 權限까지 가지고 잇서서 假令 엇든 地方에 反革命運動이 이러난다면 多數한 軍隊를 出動식혀 鎭撫하며 그 밧게 國事犯人 又는 社會主義國家의 制度維特에 害를 加하는 人物은 언제든지 逮捕, 監禁, 處刑할 수 잇게 된 것은 勿論이다.
그러나 께,베,우가 直接 司法機關이 아님으로 處刑 後에 司法官廳에 報告는 하여야 하게 되엇다 한다.
께,베,우의 部員은 帽子와 襟章을 綠色이고＜51＞, 洋服은 「가-끼」色 服裝을 着하고 잇는데 工場, 官廳, 旅舘 等 各處에 間接 部員이 만흔 것은 더 무를 餘地업는 일이다.
엇재든 建設期의 現 露西亞에는 께,베,우의 警察網이 곳곳에 完全하께 벌녀 잇서서 過去에 混沌期를 無事히 整理通過하엿고 압흐로도 革命露西亞를 굿굿히 직허나갈 모양이라 할다.＜52＞
