**Body Text Translation:**

Song of Wang Chao-chün

Year after year, dwelling in Weiyang Palace,
Spring days pass slowly, autumn nights are long.
The Emperor's favor is deep, but this servant's fate is thin,
Spring birds fly out to the northern lands (朔方), feelings are wounded.

On horseback, holding the pipa,
The Great Wall (萬里長城) rises from yellow sand for ten thousand li.
The sky at dusk grows dim, pale clouds scatter,
In the land of the Hu (胡地), the sound of their language saddens me for [my lost] favor.

Tears from two eyes flow continuously, soaking [my clothes],
Holding back sorrow, swaying sadly, I pass through the Han Pass (漢關).
*Farewell to the Phoenix Pavilion (鳳閣), farewell to the Dragon Face (龍顔 Emperor's face),
Gazing sorrowfully at the mountains of Yenching (燕京山), desolate. <20>

**Summary**

This poem recounts the sorrowful journey of Wang Chao-chün, a Han Dynasty court lady sent north to marry a Xiongnu ruler. It describes her lingering life in the palace, the abrupt turn of fate despite the emperor's favor, the desolate landscape of her journey beyond the Great Wall, and her tearful farewell to her homeland and emperor. The poem emphasizes her grief, loneliness, and the cultural alienation symbolized by the unfamiliar language and bleak scenery. From the perspective of Korean colonial history, the poem's theme of forced departure, loss of homeland, and sorrow under a powerful entity (the Emperor, analogous to a ruling power) could resonate with contemporary Korean sentiments of cultural loss and displacement under Japanese rule. Historians might find the use of this specific Chinese historical allegory notable as a potentially permissible way to express national grief or feelings of subjugation during a period of censorship.
