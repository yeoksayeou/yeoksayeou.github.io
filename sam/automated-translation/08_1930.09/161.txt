Notice from the Company

One
Many people are ordering the inaugural issue and others of this magazine, but the inaugural issue is completely sold out, and only a few copies of issues 2, 4, 5, and 6 remain. Please be aware of this when placing your order.

Two
To those who ordered the July issue, we were unable to send it because we ran out of copies. Instead, we are sending the August issue as a substitute.

Three
We are recruiting for domestic and overseas branches and sales agents. Those interested, please request the internal regulations. <44>

**Summary**

This is a notice from the publisher of the magazine 'Samch'ŏlli' addressing circulation issues. They inform readers that the first issue is sold out, only limited copies of issues 2, 4, 5, and 6 are left, and the July issue is unavailable, with the August issue sent as a replacement. The notice concludes by soliciting applications for domestic and overseas branch offices and sales agents. For historians, this brief notice offers insight into the magazine's popularity (running out of copies) and its business operations, including distribution challenges and expansion plans (seeking branches/agents) during the colonial period. The language used also reflects Korean orthography and politeness conventions of the 1930s.
