Journey to Paektu Mountain, All Contemporary Literary Masters Emerge, Survey of the Peninsula's Eight Scenic Views Begins
						Written by Minse An Chaehong
To be serialized starting in the upcoming September issue of this magazine!

Paektu Mountain (白頭山), Kŭmgang Mountain (金剛山), the Taedong River (大同江), Kyŏngju (慶州), Puyŏ (扶餘), Haeundae (海雲臺), Myŏngsa Simni (明沙十里), and Yŏngsŏngnu Pavilion (嬴石樓) are the proudest Eight Scenic Views held by our three-thousand-ri Land of Brocade Rivers and Mountains (錦繡江山 三千里). These were decided upon based on fair designations received from over 50 writers of all Chosŏn (全朝鮮) by our company, and we believe all compatriots under heaven (普天下) will affirm them. Now, our company has commissioned the contemporary literary masters (當代 文豪) to visit each site in person, receive their travel accounts (紀行), and starting from the upcoming September issue, introduce one view each month widely to the world. Thus, we decided to start by excavating Paektu Mountain, which conceals treasures of myriad ages historically, politically, and geographically. For this reason, Mr. Minse An Chaehong (民世 安在鴻氏), whose literary fame already covers the generation (一世), is currently exploring Paektu Mountain despite the present midsummer heat (三伏). O, 100,000 readers, please count the days and anticipate the upcoming September issue, which ushers in the cool autumn breeze (新凉)! Photo is Mr. An Chaehong.

**Summary**

This 1930 article from the magazine *Samch'ŏlli* announces a forthcoming series of travelogues covering the "Eight Scenic Views of the Korean Peninsula," as selected by over 50 Korean writers. The series, starting in the September issue, will begin with Paektu Mountain, authored by the prominent intellectual and writer An Chaehong, who is currently undertaking the journey. The magazine promotes this series as a significant national endeavor, urging its 100,000 readers to look forward to it. For historians, this piece is interesting as it exemplifies cultural nationalism during the Japanese colonial period, highlighting efforts to define and celebrate Korean identity through its landscape and prominent literary figures. The selection of Paektu Mountain, a potent symbol of Korean national origin, and the involvement of major contemporary writers underscore the cultural significance attributed to this project amidst colonial rule.
