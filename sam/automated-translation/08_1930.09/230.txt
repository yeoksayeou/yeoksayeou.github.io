Night Patrol Report

India's Victims
On July 3rd in the British House of Commons, the Secretary of State for India, Mr. Benn, responding to a question from a Member of Parliament, stated that as of May 31st, the total number of people convicted of serious crimes related to the non-violent civil disobedience movement (非軍事不服從運動) that began in India on March 1st and are currently serving sentences reached 3,200.

German University Students' Duels
The duels (決鬪), once called a specialty of German university students, had completely ceased due to opposition from moralists (道德家) and the World War, but recently in the newly rising Germany, asserting that "Young students need fighting spirit (鬪志)," duels have been revived and are reportedly greatly popular everywhere. <52>

Poison Gas and Executions
While the method of execution in the USA recently changed from hanging (絞殺) to the electric chair, lately even electricity is considered old-fashioned (舊式), and poison gas (毒瓦斯) has been adopted. It is said that installing it doesn't cost much, unlike electricity, and one execution costs about 50 *chŏn*. However, when conducting a poison gas execution at a certain prison (監獄), the executing warden asked the condemned prisoner,
"Do you have any last words (遺言)?"
The prisoner reportedly replied,
"Just give me one mask that can resist poison gas. That is my final wish (所願)."
What a masterpiece (傑作) of an anecdote. <53>

A Wise Judgment
In Shanghai (上海城內), there lived a famously beautiful daughter of a certain Mr. Hŏ. When she was young, she was engaged (約婚) to a laundryman (洗濯匠) in the same village, and the laundryman also delighted in watching the young lady grow up.
One day, a Chinese executive (中國人 重役) working at a foreign trading house (外國商舘) persuaded the father with generous gifts of cloth (布帛) and money, arranging a new engagement with the daughter. This was, of course, after breaking the engagement (破婚) with the laundryman.
The laundryman, having lost his beloved fiancée, was angered (憤). So he filed a lawsuit. The chief judge summoned the daughter, the father, the laundryman, and the executive. Just as the trial (裁判) was about to begin, unbeknownst to anyone, he had given the daughter an anesthetic drug (魔醉藥). <53>
In the courtroom (法庭), the two men argued over the woman standing between them. Just then, the girl collapsed as if dead. The chief judge, startled, leaped down from the bench, checked her pulse, and exclaimed,
"Good heavens! She's dead!"
He then had the daughter's corpse (屍体) carried outside. Nevertheless, the trial continued as before (如前).
"Now, the lady you two were fighting over has suddenly died (急死). Even though she is dead, the court will decide who owns her corpse."
At that, the executive said resentfully,
"Forget it. Did I want a dead girl? I wanted a living one."
However, the laundryman, shedding tears, pleaded,
"Even though we were only engaged, she was the one I loved. Please give me even her corpse (송장). I will take her away and give her a proper burial (長沙)."
The chief judge smiled and gave the corpse to the laundryman. As the laundryman tearfully went to embrace the corpse of his beloved, the lady smiled faintly and yawned. She had just awakened from the anesthetic. It goes without saying that the two joyfully lived happily ever after (階老同穴). <54>
<52-54>

**Summary**

This article presents four unrelated short reports: the number of imprisonments in India due to the civil disobedience movement, the revival of student dueling in Germany, the adoption of poison gas for executions in the US alongside a dark humor anecdote, and a tale of a wise judge in Shanghai resolving an engagement dispute using a staged death. The pieces offer glimpses into international affairs and social customs as perceived or reported in colonial Korea during 1930. Historians might find the selection interesting for its portrayal of global events (India's independence movement, post-WWI Germany, US penal methods) alongside a traditional Chinese story, reflecting the diverse information circulating in the period. The matter-of-fact reporting on potentially sensitive topics like colonial repression or capital punishment methods is also noteworthy.

夜巡探報告
印度의 犧牲者
7月 3日 英國 下院에서 印度事務大臣 『벤』氏는 一議員의 質問에 對하야 3月 1日 以來 印度에 이러난 非軍事不服從運動에 關聯되여 重罪의 判決을 밧고 現在 服役하는 人數가 5月 31日 現在로 總數 3千 32百名에 達하엿다고 言明하엿다.

獨逸大學生의 決鬪
얼마 전까지 독일 대학생의 명물이라 하든 결투(決鬪)는 도덕가의 반대와 세게대전 등으로 전혀 중단되어 왓스나 최근에 신흥 독일에서는
「靑年學生들에게 鬪志가 必要하다」
하야 결투가 다시 부활되어 처처에서 괴쟝히 류행한다고.＜52＞

毒瓦斯와 死刑執行
米國의 死刑執行方法은 絞殺로부터 電氣椅子로 變한 것도 近者의 일이지만은 最近에는 電氣도 舊式이라 하야 毒瓦斯가 採用되엇다는데 그것이면 電氣모양으로 裝置하기에 費用도 만히 아니들어 한번 死刑하는데 約 50錢이면 된다고 한다. 그런데 엇든 監獄에서 毒瓦斯刑을 執行할 때 死刑囚더러
「무에 遺言할 말이 업느냐」
하고 執行典獄이 무르니
「毒瓦斯에도 죽지 아는 「마스크」 한 개 만 주구려. 그것이 마즈막 所願이요」
하더라고. 傑作이야.＜53＞

名裁判
上海城內에 사는 許哥의 딸에 有名한 美人이 잇섯다. 어릴 때에 그 동리 洗濯匠이에게 約婚을 하엿는데 洗濯匠이도 따님이 커가는 것을 즐기고 잇섯다.
하로는 外國商舘에 다니는 中國人 重役이 布帛과 돈을 厚히 주고 그 아버지를 달내어 딸과 다시 約婚을 맷게 하엿다. 勿論 洗濯匠이와 破婚하고서.
사랑하는 愛人을 일흔 洗濯장이는 憤하엿다. 그래서 裁判을 걸엇다. 裁判長은 딸과 아비와 洗濯匠이와 重役을 呼出하여 裁判을 始作하려 할 때에 아모도 모르게 그 딸에게 魔醉藥을 멕이어＜53＞ 두엇다.
法庭에서 두 사내는 한 계집을 가운데 노코 서로 다토앗다. 그럴 때에 게집애는 그만 죽은드시 꺽구러지고 말엇다. 裁判長은 깜작 놀나 法壇에서 뛰어내려 診脈하여 보더니
「앗불사! 죽엇구나」
그러고는 딸의 屍体를 밧갓헤 運搬하여 버렷다. 그러치만 裁判은 如前히 繼續되엇다.
「자 너이들이 다투는 색시는 이제 急死하엿다. 죽은 색시의 시체라도 裁判하여 누구의 所有로 決定할 터이냐」
그 때 重役은 憤한드시
「그만두오. 나는 산 계집애를 가지자 햇지 죽은 계집애를 가지자고 햇나뇨」
그러나 洗濯匠이는 눈물을 흘니며
「비록 約婚만 한 계집이라도 내 사랑하든 사람이니 송장이라도 주시오. 내가 안어다가 고히 고히 장사라도 지내어 주겟스니」
裁判長은 우스면서 屍体를 洗濯匠이의게 내어 주엇다. 洗濯匠이가 울며 죽은 愛人의 屍体를 안으려 할 때 색시는 방그시 우스며 하펌을 친다 그는 마취약에서 그 때 바로 깨어난 것이라. 둘이 조와서 階老同穴한 것은 물론이다.＜54＞
