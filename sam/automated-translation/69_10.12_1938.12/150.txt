Our Army [...] in the [...] area [...] scattered hundreds of thousands of surrender recommendation flyers (投降 勸告票) advising [...] to the hundreds of thousands of Chinese (支那) troops.

The phrases printed on the flyers, of which there are several dozen types, include things like the [...] of the North China (北支) and Central China (中支) regimes, or the meaning that the Japanese Army (日軍) [...] China (支那) [...].

The observed points (觀栽事項) illustrated here are: 1. Surrenderers, bring this flyer (此票) and come to the Japanese Army (日本軍). 2. The Japanese Army (日本軍) does not view those who bring this flyer as enemy soldiers and will treat them favorably (優*).<124>

**Summary**

This short article describes the Japanese military's use of propaganda leaflets during the Second Sino-Japanese War. It notes that hundreds of thousands of "surrender recommendation flyers" were dropped over Chinese forces. These leaflets, varying in content, mentioned the Japanese-supported regimes in North and Central China and provided instructions for surrender, promising favorable treatment by the Japanese Army to those carrying the flyer. From a Korean colonial history perspective, the article is notable for its use of "Our Army" (我軍) to refer to the Japanese Imperial Army, reflecting the enforced viewpoint within colonial Korean publications. It provides a glimpse into Japanese psychological warfare tactics aimed at Chinese soldiers during the conflict.
