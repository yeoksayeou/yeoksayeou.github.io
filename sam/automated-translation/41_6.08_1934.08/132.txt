"I've decided not to drink unless it's quite an occasion."

"Quite an occasion, you say?"

"A time when I *really* want to drink!"<82>

**Summary**

This short piece presents a simple, humorous dialogue between two people. One person states they only drink on 'important occasions', which, when questioned, they define simply as any time they strongly feel like having a drink. The piece showcases colloquial humor from the 1930s. For historians, it offers a glimpse into everyday conversation, social attitudes towards drinking (presented humorously), and the style of light content published in popular magazines during the colonial period.
