Company Notice
						Samch'ŏlli Editorial Department

We deeply apologize that many articles previously scheduled had to be postponed to next month's issue due to space limitations. Furthermore, the upcoming September issue will be presented as an Autumn Festival (秋節) special feature. <136>

**Summary**

This brief notice from the Samch'ŏlli Editorial Department apologizes to readers for having to postpone several planned articles to the next issue because of limited space. It also announces that the forthcoming September issue will be a special feature dedicated to the Autumn Festival (Chuseok). From a historical perspective, the notice reflects common publishing challenges (space constraints) and promotional strategies (announcing special editions). The use of Hanja mixed with Hangul, alongside older grammatical forms like "만하엿슴을" and "함니다," is characteristic of Korean writing during the colonial period. The mention of the Autumn Festival (秋節) highlights the continued observance of traditional holidays.
