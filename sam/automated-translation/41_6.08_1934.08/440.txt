When the Canna Flowers Bloom

A small bird chirps in the mulberry tree,
One afternoon when the tree shadows stretch long!

Red, almost blood-like, canna blossoms
Spread their four petals under the June sun.

Burning and burning, they become fire,
And the land where they stand burns crimson too.

In this heart too, I shall plant canna flowers,
May high passion become fire, let me burn too.

A Small Streamside Scene

The mountain peak reflected in the water seems to have quietly closed its eyes,
This stream alone washes the sleeping face of a giant.
How has the deep meditation of several thousand days not awakened?

Where the stream flows and bends, flower irises bloom beautifully,
For whom did that bluebird come to this deep valley?
The water play seems like blue jade, perhaps that's why the bird came.

Using a flat rock as a seat, leaning on a pine branch,
Every melody of the water sound holds a lofty eternal divine charm,
Only the clouds in the blue sky come and go.<181>

**Summary**

This article presents two untitled poems grouped under the collection title "春城詩集" (Ch'unch'ŏng Poetry Collection). The first poem, "칸나꽃 필 때" (When the Canna Flowers Bloom), uses the image of vibrant red canna flowers burning under the June sun to express a desire for intense, consuming passion within the speaker's own heart. The second poem, "溪邊小景" (A Small Streamside Scene), depicts a tranquil natural setting with a mountain reflected in water, irises, a bluebird, and the sound of the stream, evoking a sense of timelessness and peaceful contemplation. From a historical perspective, these poems, published during the colonial period, primarily focus on nature and personal emotion. While seemingly apolitical, the intense passion in the first poem could potentially be read allegorically, and the focus on the beauty of a Korean landscape (streamside scene) might represent a quiet affirmation of natural heritage amidst foreign rule, offering historians a glimpse into subtle expressions of feeling during that era.

春城詩集
칸나꽃 필 때

뽕나무 속에 적은 새가 재글그리고
나무그림자 길게 느러진 어느날午後!

붉다못해 피빛 같은 칸나꽃송이
六月의 太陽믿에 네활개 펴네.

타고타고 모다타서 불이되여서
그가선 土地까지 뻘것게 타네.

이맘에도 칸나꽃을 심어 보오리
높은熱情 불이 되야 나도 타옵세.

溪邊小景

山봉아리 물에 빛어 고요히 눈 감운듯
巨人의 자는 얼골 이 물결 흘로싯(洗)네.
몃千年깊은 日冥想 어이 않이 깨옵든가?

시내 흘너 굽은 곧에 꽃 昌浦 곱게핀데
저靑鳥 뉘를 찾어 이深谷왓단말가
물노리靑玉같아 그새온 듯 하여라.

盤石을자리하고 솔가지에 지대이니
물소리曲調마다 萬年神韻높사온데
靑空의구름만이 오락가락하더라.<181>
