Gentleman Study (1), Mr. An Chae-hong, Delving into Astronomy

Minse An Chae-hong (民世 安在鴻氏) has recently been delving into astronomy. If you visit his study in P'yŏng-dong, outside Sŏdaemun, Seoul, you'll find ancient-looking astronomical charts, seemingly drawn by some royal astronomer from 2,000-3,000 or even 5,000-6,000 years ago during some ancestral era, pasted on three walls of the small room. He spends his spare time studying things like which one is Neptune (海王星) and where Venus (金星) is located. His research seems to have already reached a profound level, and he pours out his accumulated knowledge (薀蓄) to explain that it is by no means inferior compared to modern astronomy.

After his release from prison, Mr. An has temporarily set aside the clamorous worldly affairs and is delving into astronomical charts and ancient classical texts, sending his thoughts far away to the culture of this land a thousand years ago. This befits his character in an era of misfortune (不遇時代). Had it been someone unable to maintain their integrity (節介) after release from prison, they would have likely already turned to deviant paths seeking livelihood (米鹽), but Mr. An alone seeks a state of inner peace (心自閑) amidst ancient classics, substituting it for a life of leisurely retirement (閑雲野鶴).

It is heard that during the hottest days of summer (三伏之冔), he plans to accept an invitation from distant friends (有朋) and set out to traverse the mountains and rivers (山川跋涉) into the T'aebaek Mountains (太白山脈) and deep within Chiri Mountain (智異山).

People hope that Mr. An will once again stand at the forefront of the journalism world and wield his sharp and upright pen (侃愕의 筆陳). If he is reluctant to step into that arena, many wish for him to serve as a professor at some vocational school (專門學校敎援) or as the director (舘長) of a large national library (民族的 큰 圖書館).

What plans (經綸) does Mr. An hold in his heart for the future? (Reference: Mr. An was President of the Chosŏn Ilbo, an executive committee member of the Sin'ganhoe, imprisoned 3 times for incidents including the Ch'ŏngnyŏndang Incident (靑年黨事件) and journalistic offenses (筆禍等), author of *Paektusan Kŭnch'amgi* (白頭山覲叅記), age 42) <64>

**Summary**

This 1934 article describes the activities of An Chae-hong (Minse), a prominent Korean intellectual and nationalist, following his release from prison. Instead of immediately re-entering the political or journalistic fray, An is engrossed in studying ancient Korean astronomy and classical texts in his Seoul home. The article portrays this as a fitting retreat for a man of integrity during a difficult era ("era of misfortune"), contrasting him with those who might compromise principles for sustenance. While noting public desire for his return to journalism or a position in education or librarianship, it mentions his plans for summer travel to mountains like T'aebaek and Chiri, and briefly references his past roles (Chosŏn Ilbo President, Sin'ganhoe member) and imprisonments. For historians, this piece offers insight into how a significant nationalist figure navigated life under colonial rule after imprisonment, choosing intellectual and cultural pursuits (specifically focusing on traditional Korean knowledge like astronomy) as a form of resilience or temporary withdrawal, reflecting the limited options and pressures faced by activists during this period. The mention of his specific interest in ancient astronomy as being comparable to modern science is also noteworthy.

紳士硏究(1), 天文學 뒤지는 安在鴻氏
民世 安在鴻氏는 요지간 天文學을 뒤지고 계시다. 서울 西大門밧 平洞에 잇는 그의 書齋를 차즈면 조고마한 房 3面에 아마 年代로 치면 2,300년 내지 5,600년 前 무슨祖 時代, 天文博士가 그린듯한 古色蒼然한 天文地圖를 부처노코, 海王星이 어느 것이요 金星이 어느 位置에 잇다는 等을 틈틈히 硏究하고 잇다. 이미 硏究는 깁흔데 미츤 모양으로 現代 天文學에 比하여 決코 遜色이 업다고 薀蓄을 기우러 說明하여 준다.
出獄后의 氏는 喧擾한 世上風雲을 잠간 제처노고 天文圖나 古文典籍을 뒤지며 멀니 생각을 千年前 이 땅 文化에 보내고 잇다. 不遇時代의 氏의 風格에 어을니는 일이다. 出獄后 或 節介 못직히는 이 엇드면 벌서 米鹽을 차저 外道로 발길을 옴겻슬 것이로되 氏만은 古文典籍숙에 一時 閑雲野鶴에 代하야 心自閑의 境地를 스사로 찾고 잇다.
드른즉 三伏之冔에는 멀니 有朋의 招請을 밧어 太白山脈으로, 智異山숙으로 山川跋涉으로나서리라든가.
世人은 氏가 다시 言論界陳頭에 나서서 侃愕의 筆陳을 퍼기를 期待한다. 만일 발이 그에 미치기 실타 할진대, 어느 專門學校敎援 又는 民族的 큰 圖書館의 舘長으로 게시게 하고 십흔  생각을 갓고 잇다.
