Idle Talk Room
Two Lines of Famous Poetry

One day, Anso Kim Ŏk (岸曙 金億氏) visited our office crestfallen (撫然히), had his face read (觀相), and while telling all sorts of stories, as if feeling irritated (心火), wrote down a line from an old poem (古紙) on scrap paper (休紙) and left.
Ten thousand plans are in the heart, but not a single penny (分錢) is in the hand.

Interpretation of Difficult Phrases

Poet Pak Wŏlt'an (朴月灘) and novelist Kim Tongin (金東仁氏) visited our office around the same day and wrote this line of Hanmun poetry (漢詩). However, Kim Tongin's version was:
A son born at eighty is not my son;
All property is given to the son-in-law, others should not be concerned.

Pak Wŏlt'an (朴月灘) corrected it like this. It would be good if you could tell us which one is correct.
A son born at eighty is not my son;
Family property and household goods (家産什物) are entrusted (付之於) to the son-in-law, others should not be concerned (他人他關焉).<185>

**Summary**

This short article from the "Idle Talk Room" section recounts two brief anecdotes involving well-known literary figures visiting the magazine's office. Poet Kim Ŏk expresses financial frustration by leaving a poignant couplet. Then, poet Pak Wŏlt'an and novelist Kim Tongin offer slightly differing versions of a Hanmun phrase concerning inheritance and paternity late in life, seeking clarification on the correct wording. From a historical perspective, the piece illustrates the informal interactions within the Seoul literary circle during the colonial period and the continued relevance of Hanmun (Classical Chinese) literacy and poetic tradition among Korean intellectuals, even as they engaged with modern media like magazines. The content subtly touches upon the economic anxieties of artists and potentially traditional inheritance customs.
