鍾路艶話 (Scandalous Tales of Chongno)
The Sin of the Rain

Suddenly, a downpour begins. A young man walking down the street, having no choice, held his straw hat to his chest and entered the dim doorway of some house behind an inn.
A little later, a high-collar woman wearing high-heeled shoes also entered there to take shelter from the rain. Of course, she hadn't dreamt that a man had already taken refuge there first.
The man took off his Western-style jacket and gently placed it over the woman's shoulders. The woman was startled at first, but eventually showed eyes of gratitude.
Is it said that the distance between the sexes is both far and near? About 10 minutes later, when they came out, neither was chaste any longer. However, the two did not tell each other their names. Neither regretted this.
Do you know, O moralists, that Seoul is changing like this, or do you not? <141>

The Five Jeon Incident

At four in the morning, leaning against a pillar of some brick building in front of the Umi'gwan theater, stood a beautiful woman, sixteen years of age (芳記 二八), clutching her empty stomach. It was later learned that she was a certain lady (閣氏 某女史) who had come up from some village in Kangwŏn Province after hearing how nice Seoul was, but she had no money, was hungry, and furthermore, had no place to sleep. Thus, at this late hour (丑滿時), long past midnight in the great capital (大長安), she was standing by the pillar of the brick building.
Just then, a certain gentleman (一位 紳士), half-drunk (半醉) and coming out of the Myŏngwŏl'gwan restaurant, saw this pitiful sight (光景).
"Are you hungry?"
"Yes, I haven't even eaten dinner."
"Then shall I get you some noodles?"
The woman followed the gentleman into an udon shop nearby (近傍), where he treated her to a bowl of udon worth the grand sum (大金) of five jeon. After eating, the lady (淑女) said, "Thank you. I'll be going now."
"Going? Just going like that? You eat five jeon worth and just leave?"
Saying this, he grabbed the woman's right hand. It seems he intended to seek the price (代償) of five jeon from the woman's body (肉體).
"If you buy noodles, you just buy them. Who asked you to?"
"What? What did you say? If you won't listen to me, then pay the five jeon and go."
As they were arguing noisily, a patrolling policeman (巡査) arrived. The gentleman immediately fled, and the woman sighed. It is said that such incidents are not infrequent (非一非再) on Chongno late at night (丑臨時). <143>

**Summary**

This article presents two short anecdotes illustrating the changing social mores and harsh realities of life in 1930s Seoul (Keijō). The first story depicts a spontaneous, anonymous sexual encounter between a man and a woman sheltering from rain, suggesting a breakdown of traditional morals. The second portrays the vulnerability of a poor, newly arrived young woman from the countryside who is treated to a cheap meal by a drunken man, only for him to demand sexual favors as repayment, highlighting the dangers and exploitation faced by women in the city. From a historical perspective, these vignettes are interesting as they offer glimpses into urban life in colonial Seoul, touching on themes of modernity ("high-collar woman," Western clothing), changing sexual attitudes, rural-urban migration, poverty, the transactional nature of relationships under duress, and the presence of colonial authority (the巡査/policeman).

鍾路艶話
비의 罪

갑작이 소낙비 퍼붓는다. 길가든 엇던 청년이 不得已 麥고 모子를 가슴에 안고 행낭 둿골 엇던 집 어둑스러한 문깐에 들어섯다.
조곰 잇다가 굽 놉흔 구두 신은 하이칼라 女性이 역시 비를 피하여 거기 드러섯다. 물론 몬저 사내가 비를 피하여 드러가 잇거니는 꿈에도 생각지 못하고.
사내는 양복 저고리를 벗겨 가만히 녀자의 억개에 걸처주다. 녀자는 처음엔 놀나다가 나종에는 감사의 눈을 보인다.
멀면서 갓가운 것은 이성 사이라든가 약 10분 후에 나올 때에는 피차에 純潔한 몸이 안이엿다. 그러나 둘은 서로 일홈을 말치 안엇다. 그것을 피차에 후회하지 안엇다.
서울은 이러케도 변하여 가는 줄 아는가 모르는가 道學者여.<141>

五錢事件

새벽 네시 優美館 압 엇던 벽돌집 기둥에 주우린 배를 움켜쥔 芳記 二八, 아름다운 女性 한 분이 서고 잇섯다. 나종에 알고 보니 서울이 하도 조탄 말 듯고 江原道 어느 시골에선가 올나온 閣氏 某女史인데 돈은 업고 배는 곱흐로 게다가 잘 곳좃차 업서 大長安의 丑滿時도 다 지난 이 때 벽돌집 기둥에 서 잇는 것이엇다.
때마츰 술이 半醉하여 明月館으로 나오든 一位 紳士께서 이 애처러운 光景을 보섯다.
「배곱흐오?」
「네, 저녁조차 못 먹엇서요.」
「그럼 국수줄가」
女子는 그 紳士따라 그 近傍 우동집에 드러가서 大金 五錢짜리 우동 한 그릇을 대접햇다 먹고난 淑女 「감사함니다. 저는 가요.」
「가다니 그저 가요, 오전을 그저 먹고 가?」
그리면서 女子의 오른손를 잡엇다. 그는 五錢의 代償을 女子의 肉體에서 求하려 하엿든 듯
「국수 먹이면 그저 먹인 것이지오. 누가 사달내요.」
「무에 엇재? 내말 안 듯거든 오전 내고 가거라.」
옥신갓신 와자자할 때 巡廻하든 巡査가 왓다. 紳士는 그만 줄행낭치고 여자는 한숨짓다. 종로 丑臨時에는 이런 일이 非一非再라든가. <143>
