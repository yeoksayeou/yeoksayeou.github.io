**Summary**

This "Life Bulletin Board" section from the August 1934 issue of Samch'ŏlli magazine lists prominent Korean figures suffering from illness and those planning summer vacations. Novelist Yi Ki-yŏng is seriously ill with intestinal tuberculosis, while critic Kim Ki-jŏn-min is recovering from lung disease and watching events within Ch'ŏndogyo. Others, including Dr. Paek In-je, Hŏ Hŏn, An Chae-hong, Yi Kwang-su, Pak Han-yŏng, and Chŏng In-bo, are taking summer trips to notable locations like Kŭmgangsan, Myohyangsan, and Kuwŏlsan. For historians, this article provides a snapshot into the lives of the Korean intellectual and professional elite during the colonial period, revealing common health concerns like tuberculosis, leisure activities such as mountain visits and coastal trips, and awareness of contemporary socio-religious issues like the situation within Ch'ŏndogyo. The specific individuals mentioned and their activities offer insight into the social networks and cultural practices of the time.
