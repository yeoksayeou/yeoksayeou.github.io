Samch'ŏlli Annals/Commentary
Floods in the Three Southern Provinces (三南水災), Alas, Blue Heaven (鳴呼蒼天)! What oppressive feelings (抑何心情)!

Frequent comings and goings of political figures (政容羣) to Tokyo (東京). Is it for money? For honor? For the nation? I don't know, Heaven doesn't know, Earth doesn't know—where shall I ask? How utterly frustrating (於我沓沓)!

Although figures like Kim Tong-sŏng (金東成), Chŏng In-gwa (鄭仁果), An To-san (安島山), etc., have been to the Philippines (比島), not even a single piece of travelogue has been contributed. Although Hong Myŏng-hŭi (洪命憙), Chŏng In-bo (鄭寅普), Chŏng Sŏk-t'ae (鄭錫泰), etc., have gone to the South Sea Islands (南洋羣島), let alone investigation of industry and academics, there isn't even a single memoir. Although Kim Sŏng-su (金性洙) and others passed through India (印度), let alone an account of meeting Gandhi (간듸 會見記), not even one photo of India has been shown to the world. Although Hong Pyŏng-sŏn (洪秉璇), Kim Hwal-lan (金活蘭), etc., have been to Jerusalem (예루살넴), not even a piece of a Holy Land pilgrimage account has been contributed. In general, what did you gentlemen (卿等) go there to do?

We look down upon (x 視한다) you gentlemen who returned after travels of sightseeing and pleasure (觀月弄花的 여행), spending that much precious money like water. If nameless students (無名의 學徒) had been sent instead, wouldn't they have collected valuable research materials on the life systems, politics, and society of those countries? Urging reflection from the insincere, effortless seniors (先輩).

Seoul Club (서울 俱樂部) born, Kapo Club (甲午俱樂部) in gestation. Are they all preparing to ride the winds of change (風雲)?

Recently, there are various rumors (諸風說) surrounding Mr. Ch'oe Ch'ang-hak (崔昌學). What interest is there in the fortunes of someone who possesses wealth only personally? But money belongs to the world (天下). If money is used well, even if one becomes poor, friends fill the Four Seas (四海) and fame lasts for a thousand autumns (千秋). A certain Mr./Ms. X (某氏) is outstanding (傑物) in this regard.

The establishment of the Chungang Ilbo (中央日報) Joint-Stock Company—while the efforts of various worthies (諸賢) are appreciated, if there are still benefactors (有志者) investing in media organizations, which are still loss-making enterprises (消耗事業), there is much hope for the future of the Peninsula (半島). Relief.<45>

**Summary**

This article from 1934 critiques the Korean elite who traveled abroad extensively (to places like the Philippines, South Sea Islands, India, Jerusalem) but failed to produce any meaningful reports, travelogues, or academic contributions for the benefit of Korea, merely enjoying lavish trips. The author contrasts this with the potential contributions nameless students might have made and urges self-reflection from these "seniors." It also notes the formation of social clubs like the Seoul Club and Kapo Club, speculates on the changing fortunes and social responsibility of the wealthy like Ch'oe Ch'ang-hak, and expresses hope for Korea's future due to the establishment of the Chungang Ilbo newspaper company, despite the financial risks of media ventures. For historians, the article offers a contemporary critical perspective on the Korean elite's perceived detachment and lack of contribution during the colonial period, commentary on the use of wealth, the emergence of social organizations, and the significance placed on national media development.

三千里春秋
三南水災, 鳴呼蒼天. 抑何心情

東京往來의 政容羣 頻繁, 돈때문인가 名譽때문인가 民族때문인가 吾不知, 天不知, 地不知將何處問乎, 於我沓沓

比島에 단녀온 이에 金東成, 鄭仁果, 安島山, 等 諸氏有하것만 一片의 紀行文 끼친 것 조차 업고, 南洋羣島에 갓다 온 이에 洪命憙, 鄭寅普, 鄭錫泰等 諸氏잇건만 그亦 産業學術의 調査는 고사하고 오히려 一片의 回想記조차 업고, 印度를 通過한 이에 金性洙氏 等이 有하건만 간듸 會見記는 고사하고 印度 寫眞 한 장 世上에 보임이 업고 예루살넴에 洪秉璇, 金活蘭 等諸氏 단녀왓건만 聖地巡禮記의 一片조차 끼친 것이 업다. 大體 卿等은 무얼하려 갓다왓노.

그 만혼 돈, 그 악가운 돈을 물쓰듯하며 觀月弄花的 여행을 하고 도라온 卿等을 우리는 x 視한다. 차라리 無名의 學徒을 보냇던들 그 나라 그 민족의 생활제도와 정치사회의 귀중한 조사자료나마 수집하야 가지고 오지안엇스랴, 無誠意 無努力의 先輩의 反省을 促.

서울 俱樂部 誕生, 甲午俱樂部 胎中. 모다 風雲을 타려고 준비함인가?

崔昌學氏 신변에 근래 諸風說有, 富를 오직 개인적으로 소유한 氏의 盛衰에 무슨 관심이 가랴만은, 돈은 天下의 것, 돈을 잘쓰면 가난방이 되여도 동무가 四海에 차고 名譽千秋에 傳한다.
某氏는 이点에서 傑物.

中央日報 주식회사 성립  諸賢의 노력도 感謝하거니와 아직 消耗事業인 언론기관에 出資하는 有志者잇거니 하면 半島의 前途에 希望多. 安心.<45>
