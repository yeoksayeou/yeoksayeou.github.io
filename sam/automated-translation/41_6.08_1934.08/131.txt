Tremendous Confidence

Sukcha (淑子), Ŭnhŭi (銀姬), and Wangyŏp (王葉), three old school friends, met at the Chongno (鍾路) intersection. So, they decided to go up to the department store (百貨店) to have a glass of soda water (소-다水) each.

"So, who's paying?"

"How about this? Let's make a bet: the gal among the three of us who has the most handsome man (美男子) for a husband will pay."

At that moment, the three women (女子) exclaimed simultaneously:

"Oh no, that won't work! Then I'd have to pay, wouldn't I?" <81>

**Summary**

Three former school friends, Sukcha, Ŭnhŭi, and Wangyŏp, meet by chance at Chongno intersection and go to a department store for soda. They jokingly propose a bet where the woman married to the most handsome husband pays. Instantly, all three object, each implying she would have to pay, thus revealing their 'tremendous confidence' in their own husband's good looks. From a historical perspective, the snippet offers a glimpse into the urban social life of Korean women in 1930s Seoul, including leisure activities like meeting friends and visiting department stores for refreshments like soda water. It reflects modernizing trends and perhaps a changing sense of female agency or at least playful self-assertion within the colonial context; the use of older Korean spellings and mixed Hanja/Hangul script is also characteristic of the period.
