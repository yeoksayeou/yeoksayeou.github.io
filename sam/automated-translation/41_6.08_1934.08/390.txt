文人奇話 (Anecdotes about Literary Figures)

Chang Hyŏkchu (張赫宙), at first, poured his life's energy into writing works just like "Owareru Hitobito" (追はれろ人人) and "Gakidō" (餓鬼道) in the Korean language (朝鮮文) and submitted them to the Chosŏn Ilbo (朝鮮日報) and the magazine "Chosŏn chi Kwang" (朝鮮之光), but both met the misfortune of being confiscated (沒書). Spurred by this, he rewrote them into different pieces and sent them to "Kaizō" (改造), ultimately achieving the great fame he has today. It seems the humiliation suffered during his days as an unknown writer was considerable for Mr. Chang as well.

Sŏp (想涉) has moved house again. From Chukch'ŏmjŏng (竹添町) to Haengch'ondong (杏村洞), then from Haengch'ondong to some other neighborhood (某洞), and from that neighborhood again to another neighborhood (某洞) this time. Barely half a year, and he has moved 3 or 4 times.

An Sŏ (岸曙), drawn by the reputation of the philosopher Kim Chŏngsŏl (金鼎卨), sought out the house of a certain prophet (豫言者) in Hangnangtwigol. The physiognomist (觀相師) looked him up and down and said he would become a rich man worth a thousand søk (千石군 富者), but added that this would be after fifty (五十以后). Since he is now 40, it's still a dream for 10 years later.

Following An Sŏ's example (風), Yang Paekhwa (梁白華) also went to visit. The physiognomy reading predicted, "You will spend your life in honest poverty as a humble scholar (布衣寒士)."

Following Paekhwa's example (風), Pak Yŏnghŭi (朴英熙) also went. The verdict: It is his fate (八字) not to have any male offspring under his knee (膝下). Also, although he won't become very rich (富者), there's a spiritual light (靈彩) in his eyes, and the day will come when his literary fame (文名) resounds throughout the world (天下).<164>

Following Hoewŏl's example (風), Pak Wŏlt'an (朴月灘) also sought out that physiognomist (觀相師). At first glance, [the physiognomist said,] "You are good, truly good. You are blessed to become a millionaire (百萬長者)." According to others, Wŏlt'an is already a wealthy man (富豪) worth two or three hundred thousand wŏn (二三十萬圓), so it sounds plausible. Anyway, like pulling one thread leads to another (그 쥐그꼬리 그 쥐그 꼬리도 - literally 'that mouse tail, that mouse tail too'), the trend of physiognomy-thought (觀相思想) is all the rage among literary figures (文人間).

Tongin (東仁) is rushing about (大奔走) in the sweltering June heat (六月炎天) to erect a memorial stone (碑石) for Sŏhae (曙海). But his worry is, "Sŏhae, while alive, worked himself sick forgetting to eat (發憤忘食) erecting a memorial stone (碑石) for Tohyang (稻香), and then not long after, he himself suddenly died. After Sŏhae, my own fate (運命)—" and he laughs bitterly (苦笑) to himself.

Ch'unwŏn (春園) is surrounded by abundant romantic rumors (艶聞盛). Is he becoming more vigorous with age (老益盛乎)?

P'albong's (八峯) hat-off-ism (脫帽主義), P'yŏnsŏkch'on (片石村) also goes hatless (脫帽), Chagi Man (自基萬) also goes hatless (脫帽). What should be done (處置) with these three "civilized" (文明的) primitives (三原始人)?

Yun Kŭgyŏng (尹克榮) of 'Blue Sky' displayed too much artistic beauty (藝術美) in his folk song solo performance (民謠獨唱), and the audience (聽衆) mostly couldn't understand it.

Yohan (요한), even today, sitting in the position of Section Chief (課長) at the Hwasin Branch (和信支店), still diligently reviews the prize-winning novels (懸賞小說) selected during his time as Editor-in-Chief (編輯局長) at the Chosŏn Ilbo (朝鮮日報), piling them up (堆고) day after day. His colleagues (朋輩) admire (推服) him as a sincere person (誠意의 人) who fulfills his duties (義務) well.

Thanks to the activities (活약) of the Kuinhoe (九人會), a "Night of Poetry and Novels" (詩와 小說의 밤) is being held, and due to the enthusiasm (熱誠) of the Theater Arts Association (劇藝術協會), a "Lecture Event" (講演의 아-벤트) is also being held. These are welcome developments (快擧) in the literary world (文壇) recently.<165>

**Summary**

This article presents a series of short, gossipy anecdotes about prominent Korean literary figures in 1934. It covers Chang Hyŏkchu's early struggles with censorship and eventual success via a Japanese magazine, Sŏp's frequent relocations, a trend among writers like An Sŏ, Yang Paekhwa, Pak Yŏnghŭi, and Pak Wŏlt'an to consult a fortune-teller, Kim Tongin's efforts to erect a monument for Yŏm Sangsŏp (Sŏhae) while recalling Yŏm's similar effort for him (Tohyang) before his own death, rumors about Yi Kwangsu (Ch'unwŏn), the "hatless" habit of Kim Kijin (P'albong), O Sangsun (P'yŏnsŏkch'on) and another, Yun Kŭgyŏng's overly artistic performance, Chu Yohan's continued dedication to reviewing novels from his previous job, and recent literary events organized by the Kuinhoe and the Theater Arts Association. From a historical perspective, the article reveals the tangible impact of Japanese censorship on Korean writers, forcing figures like Chang Hyŏkchu to seek publication outlets in Japan ("Kaizō"). It also highlights the prevalence of superstition (physiognomy) even within the intellectual circles of colonial Korea, alongside glimpses into the personal lives, anxieties (fear of early death), and collaborative/commemorative activities (monuments, literary events) of the tightly-knit literary community during this period.

文人奇話
張赫宙, 처음 「追はれろ人人」 「餓鬼道」와 꼭가튼 作品을 一代의 精力을 드려 朝鮮文으로 써서 朝鮮日報와 雜誌「朝鮮之光」에 投稿하엿더니, 모다 沒書의 厄을 當하엿다. 이에 發奮하여 다른 글로 고처 써서 「改造」에 보내어 結局 오늘의 盛名을 어덧다한다. 無名作家時代의 受辱은 張氏에게 잇서서도 어지간 하엿든 모양.

想涉, 또 移舍, 竹添町에서 杏村洞으로 또 杏村洞에서 某洞으로, 某洞에서 이번 또 某洞으로, 겨우 半年間 3, 4차 이사.

岸曙, 哲學者 金鼎卨의 風에 끄을니어 행낭뒤골 엇든 豫言者의 집을 찻다. 그 觀相師 上下를 훌터 보더니 千石군 富者는 되겟다는데 但 五十以后의 事라는 말인재 40이니 아직 10년후의 꿈.

이 安徐의 風에 梁白華, 또 차저가다. 觀相보기가 「布衣寒士로 一生을 淸貧으로 보내리라」고言.

이 白華의 風에 朴英熙, 또 차서가다. 曰 膝下에 사내子息은 없을 八字라고, 또 큰 富者는 못되겟스나 눈에 영채잇서 文名을 天下에 떨칠 날 잇스리라고.<164>

이 懷月 風에 朴月灘, 또 그 觀相師를 찻다. 一見에 「당신은 좃소 참 좃소. 百萬長者 될 福밧은 이요」 남의 말에 月灘은 벌서 二三十萬圓의 富豪라니 可能性 잇는 말. 如何間 그 쥐그꼬리 그 쥐그 꼬리도 文人間 觀相思想 大流行.

東仁, 曙海 碑石하여 세우기에 6月炎天에 大奔走, 但 근심은 曙海는 生前에 稻香 碑石하여 세우기에 發憤忘食하더니 不久에 제가 덜컥죽더라고. 曙海 뒤에 自己의 運命이-」하고 혼자 苦笑.

春園, 身邊에 艶聞盛. 老益盛乎아.

八峯 脫帽主義, 片石村 亦 脫帽, 自基萬 又 脫帽, 이 文明的인 三原始人을 엇더케 處置하여야 조흘는고.

푸른 하늘의 尹克榮, 民謠獨唱에 너무 藝術美? 發揮, 聽衆은 모다 못 아라 듯다.

요한, 朝鮮日報 編輯局長時代 考選햇든 懸賞小說을 和信支店 課長 자리에 안즌 오늘에 조차 每日每日 堆고, 義務 잘 직히는 誠意의 人이라고 朋輩 推服.

九人會활약으로 「詩와 小說의 밤」이, 劇藝術協會의 熱誠으로 「講演의 아-벤트」가 모다 열니다, 文壇近來의 快擧.<165>
