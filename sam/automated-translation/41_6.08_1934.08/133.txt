Truth

Oksun: “Hey, could that really be true? The Bible tells the story of Adam and Eve, but did Adam really love Eve?”
Kyŏngsik: “Sure, of course. Because back then, there weren't any other women to ask out, you see.”<83>

**Summary**

This brief piece presents a humorous dialogue between two characters, Oksun and Kyŏngsik, discussing the biblical story of Adam and Eve. Oksun questions the sincerity of Adam's love for Eve, and Kyŏngsik cynically suggests Adam loved Eve simply because there were no other options. For historians, this snippet offers a glimpse into casual conversation and potentially evolving attitudes towards Western religious narratives in 1930s Korea, showcasing humor and perhaps a degree of skepticism within the colonial context.
