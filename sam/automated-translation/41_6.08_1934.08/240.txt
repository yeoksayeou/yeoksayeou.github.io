The Qualification to Mourn
						Ch'anggong

The other day, I heard that a certain Mr. Kim, an office worker at a certain club (某俱樂部), asked an elderly person for their opinion on funeral rites (喪禮), specifically about what should be done regarding mourning clothes (喪服) and the mourning period (喪期). The inclination at that club was roughly towards a hundred-day mourning period with black mourning badges.

At this time when the marriage, funeral, and ancestral rites (婚喪祭禮) of present-day Korea (朝鮮) are neither old nor new, neither Buddhist nor secular, with nothing fixed, such efforts cannot be said to be useless. However, one must not forget the fundamental basis of all rites (禮) and laws. Setting aside marriage rites (婚禮) as a separate issue for now, I wish to say a few brief words about funeral and ancestral rites (喪禮와 祭禮). The specific rites and their duration are secondary or tertiary issues; I wish to speak of their fundamental meaning.

Wailing, letting one's hair down, and wearing mourning headbands (喪巾) and mourning clothes (喪服) after one's parents have passed away stem from the extreme sorrow and profound grief (至哀極通) caused by their passing.

Now, if someone who, while their parents were alive, treated them with all kinds of disrespect and mistreatment (不孝와 賤待), seemingly waiting for them to die quickly, then, fearing the eyes and judgment of others, cries the tears of a filial son (孝子), lets down the hair that filial sons let down, and wears the mourning headband and clothes that filial sons wear—this cannot simply be seen as merely revering the empty rituals (虛禮). It would become a public acknowledgment that even an unfilial scoundrel can perform the rituals just like a filial son.

Therefore, I propose that we first determine the qualification to mourn (蒙喪) and perform ancestral rites (致祭). What does this mean? If a person, although not known as a filial son while their parents were alive, at least did not excessively mistreat (賤待) them or act unfilially, and then performs the ceremonies of grieving, mourning, and ancestral rites after their parents' death, they cannot be too deeply reproached. Conversely, if someone who subjected their parents to all kinds of abuse and mistreatment while they were alive—such that the elderly parents nearly starved or froze to death (飢死나 凍死), or were not even given a single dose of medicine when ill—is allowed to perform the same rituals others perform after the parents' death, this would not only be a ritual that forgets the fundamentals, but the very ritual meant to encourage filial piety (孝行) would instead become a means to cover up unfilial conduct (不孝). Therefore, I propose that we establish that those whose unfilial conduct was egregious (不孝가 莫甚하든 者) while their parents were alive should not be allowed to perform the rituals others do after their death.

For example, if we impose social sanctions (社會的 制裁) such as preventing those whose unfilial conduct was egregious while their parents were alive from wearing mourning headbands and clothes, or from participating in the ancestral rites (祭祀), perhaps the lifelong sorrow of elderly people who have extremely unfilial children will be somewhat lessened. <130>

**Summary**

The author, Ch'anggong, argues that the right to perform mourning rituals (蒙喪) should depend on one's conduct towards their parents during their lifetime. He criticizes the hypocrisy of individuals who were deeply unfilial (不孝) yet perform elaborate mourning ceremonies after their parents' death solely for appearance's sake. Ch'anggong proposes establishing "qualifications" for mourning, suggesting social sanctions, like prohibiting egregious offenders from wearing mourning attire or participating in rites, to uphold the true meaning of filial piety and offer some solace to mistreated parents. Historically, this article reflects the tensions in 1930s colonial Korea surrounding traditional Confucian values like filial piety and mourning rites amidst social change. It highlights contemporary concerns about formalism versus genuine sentiment in rituals and offers a critique of social hypocrisy, suggesting a desire to enforce traditional ethics through community judgment even as established customs were being questioned or simplified.

蒙喪할 資格
						蒼公
日前에 某俱樂部의 事務員 某氏가 어떤 늙은이에게 喪禮에 대한 意見을 묻되 喪服과 喪期에 대한 날을 어찌하엿으면 좋을가? 하고 該俱樂部에서는 大略 百日喪에 黑色 喪章으로써 하자는 意向이 잇다는 말을 들엇다.
現下 朝鮮의 婚喪祭禮가 모다 非舊非新 非僧非俗으로 一定한 것이 없는 이때에 그러한 努力도 無用이라고 할 수는 없다. 그러나 모든 禮라든지 법이 그 根本을 忘却하여서는 안될 것이다. 婚禮는 아즉 別問題로 하고 喪禮와 祭禮에 대하야 간단한 멧 마듸 하고십다. 其禮와 期問도 第二 第三의 問題로 하고 나는 그 根本義를 말라고저 한다.
父母가 死亡된 뒤에 哀哭하며 머리털을 풀어 헷치며 喪巾과 喪服을 입는 것은 父母가 도라가신 것이 至哀極通한데서 나오는 것이라 할 것이다.
이제 父母가 生存하엿을 때에는 온갖 不孝와 賤待하면서 어서 死亡하기를 기다리다 십히 하든 者가 남의 耳目과 是非를 두리워하여 孝子가 우는 울음을 울며 푸는 머리 풀며 쓰고 입는 喪巾과 喪服을 쓰고 입는다면 이것은 한갓 虛禮의 儀式만 崇尙한다고만 보아둘 수가 없는 일이고 不孝란 놈이라도 儀式만은 孝子와 갓치할 수 잇다는 것을 公認하는 것이 될 것이다.
그럼으로 나는 蒙喪하며 致祭할 資格부터 確定하자고 한다. 무슨 말인가 하면 사람 사람이 父母 生前에 孝子라는 말은 못 듯지만 그래도 過히 賤待하며 不孝의 노릇이나 아니하든 者로서 父母 死後에 哀痛 蒙喪 致祭의 儀式을 行한다면 그다지 深責할 수 없다. 此와 反하야 父母 生前에는 온갓 구박과 賤待를 하야 그 늙은 父母가 거진 飢死나 凍死이며 또는 病들어도藥 한 첩 지여드리지 아니하든 者로서 그 父母 死後에는 남이 行하는 儀式을 저도 幸할 수된 잇게다면 이것은 한갓 根本을 이저버린 儀式이 될 뿐 아니라 孝行하라는 儀式이 도리어 不孝를 掩護하여 주는 手段이 되고 말 것이다. 그럼으로 父母가 在世時 不孝가 莫甚하든 者가 그 死後에 남이 하는 儀式을 하지 못하도록 確定하자고 한다.
예컨대 父母 在世時 不孝가 莫甚하든 者가 喪巾과 喪服을 입지 못하도록 하며 그 祭祀에 參祀하지 아니하는 等의 社會的 制裁를 加한다면 不孝가 莫甚한 子息을 둔 늙은이들이 그 生前의 설임이 幾分이라 減하여질가 한다. <130>
