北平女子警官隊
(Peiping Women's Police Corps)

Wearing black serge trousers (羅紗), white leggings (脚絆), and short hair (斷髮), these Chinese New Women (新女性), with white-banded officer caps (士官帽子) placed on their heads, are undergoing military-style drills (兵式敎鍊).

This is the scene of the modern girls (모던 껄), organized as a 20-member contingent within the 80-member Cadet Corps (學警隊) of the Peiping (北平) Police Training Center (警官敎練所), repeating their drills daily.

Last month, the Public Security Bureau (公安局) recruited female police officers, and how brave they were—300 flower-like women gathered at once. Selecting carefully from among them, the one troop (隊) formed with 20 members is precisely this Women's Corps (女子隊).

These women undergo training (敎練) for 6 months, and the subjects (課目) are:

1.  Monthly stipend of 8 won (원) paid (支給).
2.  Wake up (起床) at 5:20 AM, physical exercise (體操) from 6 to 7 AM.
3.  Training subjects (敎練科目) start from 8 AM.
4.  Subjects: Military-style drill (兵式敎練), martial arts command (武術指揮), traffic control (交通), arrest techniques (捕繩術), Kuomintang (國民黨) spirit lectures (精神講話), judicial criminal law (司法 刑法), police science (警察學), aviation observation/policing (航空譽察), regulations (典範), service rules (勤務要則), national defense and national language (國防國語). All the above are at the middle school graduate level (中學卒業 程度).<130>

**Summary**

This article reports on the establishment of a 20-member women's police corps in Peiping (Beijing) in 1934, selected from 300 applicants by the Public Security Bureau. It details their 6-month training regimen, including a daily schedule starting at 5:20 AM, a monthly stipend of 8 won, and a curriculum covering military drills, martial arts, traffic control, arrest techniques, Kuomintang ideology, law, police science, aviation observation, and other service-related subjects, all aimed at a middle school graduate level. From a Korean colonial history perspective, the article's publication in *Samch'ŏlli* shows Korean interest in modernization efforts and changing gender roles ("New Women," "modern girls") in neighboring China. Historians might find it interesting for its documentation of female participation in policing in Republican China, the specific training involved (including political indoctrination via Kuomintang lectures), and how such developments abroad were presented to a Korean audience under Japanese rule, potentially serving as a point of comparison or inspiration.
