Study of a Lady (1), Madam Hwang Aesidŏk Who Holds the Teaching Whip

When speaking of female political figures (女流政客), one ranks Kim Maria in Wŏnsan, Hwang Aesidŏk in Sŏul, and Chŏng Ch'ilsŏng in Taegu. Since we featured Mr. An Chaehong in the 'Study of a Gentleman' in this issue, we might as well discuss Madam Hwang Aesidŏk, who makes a good pair (好一對) with Mr. An.

When Mr. An wore paulownia clothes (梧桐옷 - prison uniform) as a leader of the Youth Group in Taegu, Madam Hwang also became a wearer of paulownia clothes due to the Women's Group incident, a case of the same root, different branch (同根異枝). Setting aside past events (往事), after returning from America (米州), the Madam met a bridegroom in her late prime (老靑春) and sat facing him at the feast table (잔채床) of life. Later, as a person of affairs, she established the Young Women's Christian Association (女子基督靑年會) and was engaged in an intense struggle, like the Chu-Han contention (楚漢). More recently, after Mr. Pak Hŭido lost his position (失脚以后), she took over the management of the Central Childcare School (中央保育學校) and now, as the principal of that school, she is too busy morning and night (朝夕 눈코 못뜬다) playing the role of the kindergarten grandmother (幼稚園 할머니) (since the childcare teachers (保姆) are the children's mothers, the mother who bore those teachers must be the grandmother).

That she is called a female political figure (女流政客) was fully demonstrated in her recent acquisition of the Central Childcare School. Sensing the intention of a wealthy sponsor (財主) to take over and manage (引受經營) a certain girls' school in the city, she persuaded him overnight with sincere effort (誠意力說) through her eloquence like flowing water from a blue mountain (靑山流水) to have him take over Central Childcare instead. Isn't that method (手段) astonishing?

Thus, she herself became the Principal, and placing her actual younger sister (實弟), Madam Sindŏk, in the position of Vice Premier (副總理), akin to the Minister of Home Affairs (內務大臣格), she holds this and grasps that (감쥐고 배쥐고), displaying her political capability (政治力量) to the best of her ability (手腕것). While doing so, she is always reading Western books (洋書), zealous in self-cultivation (修養); she is someone you could entrust with an even bigger stage (舞臺) in the future and feel secure (安心할 분). Around 40 years old (年40 각가운데), she is indeed a beauty, though not a peerless beauty (絶世美人). So, what score (몃 點인가)?... How rude, how rude (失禮 失禮) towards the sacred Principal (神聖한 校長)...<65>

**Summary**

This short news article profiles Hwang Aesidŏk (黃愛施德), a prominent female figure in 1930s Korea. It notes her past imprisonment related to nationalist activities (alongside An Chaehong), her return from America, marriage, work with the YWCA, and her recent, politically astute takeover of the Central Childcare School (中央保育學校) where she serves as principal. The article highlights her capability, ambition, and dedication to self-improvement, while also commenting on her appearance in a manner typical of the era. For historians, the piece offers insights into the activities and perceived roles of educated women in colonial Korea, linking nationalist backgrounds with later careers in social work and education. It also reveals the maneuvering sometimes necessary to establish and manage institutions under colonial rule, and provides glimpses into social networks (mentioning her sister Hwang Sindŏk and An Chaehong).
