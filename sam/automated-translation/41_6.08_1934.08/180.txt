The Yama Kings of the Human World: Stories of Successive Police Commissioners, From the Kabo Year to the Present
						Hong Mokch'un

To the esteemed Editor-in-Chief of Samch'ŏlli Company: In last month's issue, you asked me to write about "The Fates of the Thirteen Provincial Governors at the Time of the Annexation." Though I don't know the details well, I managed to haphazardly fulfill the request by recalling old memories. Perhaps you mistook me for someone knowledgeable about the circumstances of the official world at that time and its inner workings, Sir, because this time you have sent a polite postscript requesting that I contribute a piece on "Stories of the Police Commissioners of the Korean Era." With all due respect, I believe this stems from your lack of understanding, Sir. The position of Police Commissioner (警務使) was established in the 503rd year of the dynasty's founding, that is, during the Kabo Reforms (甲午更張) under King Kojong, which was 40 years ago from now. As an infant wrapped in swaddling clothes back then, what could I possibly know? Furthermore, in the 14 or 15 years from the Kabo year to the Chŏngmi year (丁未, 1907), the political situation flipped back and forth like a revolving lantern (走馬燈), day and night. Political power changed hands more than ten times a year, and consequently, the number of men who became Police Commissioner was not small, likely forty or fifty. Among them, setting aside those who were "three-day Police Commissioners," there were even those dismissed before taking office, and some individuals were appointed two or three times, even up to five or six times. To put it more bluntly, the government of that time was like a busy inn, with ministers and high officials coming and going so frequently that, like being unable to track which guest stayed when without consulting the lodging register,<104> unless one consults the *Sŏnsaengan* (先生案, in the old days, each government office kept a register called *Sŏnsaengan* where changes in officials were recorded whenever they occurred) of the Police Bureau (警務廳), even the most knowledgeable elder well-versed in precedents would not be certain based on memory alone. How much less would someone like me know? Another point is that, although the period is relatively recent, there are still elderly high officials who once served as Police Commissioner alive today. Even if they have passed away, their descendants and acquaintances remain numerous. In today's society, regardless of good or bad, I believe it is proper etiquette not to hastily write anything akin to character critique. Considering this, even with your request, I thought it right to decline and had prepared a letter of refusal ("kotowari" - 断り, Japanese for refusal). However, upon re-examining your letter, it seems the manuscript deadline is only a day or two away. This is also due to your sending the request like one of Zhang Fei's military orders, pressed for time without leeway, Sir. While I could argue I have no obligation to accept responsibility, thinking it over again, I have felt a sort of gratitude since before I met you for your repeated requests over the years asking someone like me to write something. After meeting you once or twice, that feeling deepened, and though I cannot offer assistance, I did not want to cause hindrance, which is why I am writing this piece. Given these circumstances, I have entirely omitted the "secret stories of power struggles" initially requested (because I don't know them) and have also left out chronological order or a name list like the *Sŏnsaengan*, resulting in the following tasteless and rambling text. I feel even more apologetic for the overly long preamble, but I would be most grateful if you could laughingly understand that this too is a ploy to fill the lines on the page.

Enough idle talk; I shall now begin the story of the Police Commissioners. As mentioned before, the establishment of a police office and officials in Chosŏn began with the Kabo Reforms. In the old days, similar institutions in the capital city were the Left and Right Police Bureaus (左捕廳, 右捕廳). The Left Bureau was behind the current Tansŏngsa Theater, and the Right Bureau was at the site of the present Kwanghwamun Post Office. Each had a chief called the P'odotaejang (捕盜大將), filled exclusively or concurrently by a military official of Senior Second Rank or higher. Below them were military officers (軍官) and police constables (捕校) who performed duties similar to today's Police Superintendents (警視), Police Inspectors (警部), and Patrolmen (巡査). The P'odotaejang, by regulation, concurrently held the position of judge in the State Tribunal (義禁府堂上), wielding truly formidable authority. In the provinces, there were three or four, up to six or seven, military garrisons (鎭營) in each province. The Camp Commander (營將) there acted like today's Provincial Police Chief, commanding the directly assigned patrol constables (巡校) and overseeing the patrol constables assigned under the local officials such as magistrates (牧使, 府使), county chiefs (郡守), and local magistrates (縣令, 懸監). Then, in the Kabo year, the government invited Police Inspector Takehisa (武久警視) from Japan to serve as a police advisor. They adopted a modern police system in addition to the duties of the old Police Bureaus, and the chief official, the Police Commissioner (警務使), was placed under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Home Affairs (內務大臣, later 內部大臣), making it a purely civilian post. (Although many military officials became Police Commissioners, the principle of the system was civilian.) Thus, individuals like Cho Hŭiyŏn (趙羲淵), An Ilsu (安馹壽), Kwŏn Hyŏngjin (權瀅鎭), Yi Yunyong (李允用), Yi Chonggŏn (李鍾健),<105> and Min Yŏnggi (閔泳綺) are said to have been the Police Commissioners of the initial period. Also, gentlemen such as Chŏng Nak'yong (鄭洛鎔), Yun Ungnyŏl (尹雄烈), Hŏ Chin (許璡), Chang Kiryŏm (張基濂), Min Kyŏngsik (閔景植), Paek Sŏnggi (白性基), and Yi Ch'unggu (李忠求) seem to have been appointed successively. Among them, Mr. Kwŏn was the Police Commissioner during the Ŭlmi Incident (乙未事變) involving Empress Myeongseong, and his deep involvement seems to have been mentioned sometime in this magazine in the recollections of his younger brother, Kwŏn Tongjin (權東鎭). In a country under 500 years of monarchical absolutism, a political system resembling the current constitutional monarchy (though lacking a legislative assembly) was suddenly adopted. The person who felt the most dissatisfaction and inconvenience with this system was none other than King Kojong (高宗). Moreover, the Kabo Reforms originally stemmed entirely from the advice and interference of xx [likely Japan, but redacted/unclear in original], not from King Kojong's own will. Following the Triple Intervention after the Sino-Japanese War, Japan's position in East Asia changed, and King Kojong's attitude shifted accordingly. The so-called Ŭlmi Incident also originated from this cause. After the subsequent "Agwan P'ach'ŏn" (俄館播遷 - King Kojong's refuge at the Russian legation), the political situation reverted to before the Kabo year. In place of Yuan Shikai (袁世凱) and Inoue Kaoru (井上馨), the Russian Minister "Weber" (韋貝), backed by the formidable power of his country, subtly directed this nation's politics from behind the scenes. Weber focused particularly on winning King Kojong's favor, and King Kojong sought to restore strong monarchical power under Russian support. Therefore, the responsible cabinet system, even in form, came to an end with the collapse of the Kim Hongjip (金弘集) cabinet. Until the final appearance of the Yi Wanyong (李完用) cabinet, an era of pure imperial whim, a golden age of imperial power, continued for over ten years. Consequently, all appointments and dismissals of major and minor officials, both domestic and foreign, were solely dictated by the palace's will, and government offices from the State Council (議政府) downwards were merely executive agencies. The government existed in name only. Since the ministers could not fulfill their duty of assisting the ruler in practice, they advanced and retreated like travelers, letting the sovereign worry alone about the state affairs. When things were peaceful, they coveted honor, position, and high salaries; when trouble arose, they shut their doors and stayed out, saying, "It does not concern me" (吾不關焉). This period continued until the end of the Russo-Japanese War, a time so tumultuous that government reshuffles and the rise and fall of high officials occurred two or three times a month. According to the true account of an old clerk who served in the Police Bureau (警務廳) at that time, there were numerous instances where a commissioner was dismissed even before reaching his private residence to await orders, let alone showing his face at the office. This anecdote allows us to glimpse a part of the situation.

Around the 3rd or 4th year of Kwangmu (光武, 1899-1900), it seems the Police Bureau was temporarily elevated, creating a Minister of Police (警部大臣), but it reverted to its former status shortly after. Also, besides the Police Bureau, a special office directly under the Emperor called the "Palace Guard Unit" (警衛院) was established within the palace. The late Viscount Yi Kŭnt'aek (李根澤), one of King Kojong's favored subjects, served as its Director-General (總管) for a long time, wielding power and influence comparable to the former Royal Guard Commander (扈衛大將) and Chief Justice of the State Tribunal (判義禁府事). This Palace Guard Unit was abolished around the time of the palace purification during the era of Resident-General Itō (伊藤統監), and a functional office called the Chujŏnwŏn (主殿院) under the Minister of the Imperial Household was created to handle palace security. In the Chŏngmi year (1907), this duty was transferred to the Police Headquarters (警視廳). However, for a time, the Palace Guard Unit held power exceeding that of the Police Commissioner. When an order came down stating "Commanding the Palace Guard Unit to arrest and punish" (令警衛院拘拿懲辨), even the Chief State Councilor (議政大臣) could be immediately apprehended. It was a powerful agency; detractors called it "the private prison inside the great palace," and even the Minister of Justice could not interfere.<106> While Police Bureau patrolmen (巡檢) wore uniforms with white lines, Palace Guard Unit patrolmen wore caps with yellow lines, their attire signifying direct imperial affiliation. In other words, the Police Bureau at that time merely handled catching thieves and prohibiting gambling and public drunkenness; it had absolutely no involvement in matters belonging to the so-called higher police (高等警察).
On this occasion, it should be mentioned that administrative and judicial powers were indistinctly mixed back then, so the prison (監獄署) was also managed by the Police Bureau, and the Police Commissioner reportedly acted as a judge as well. Below the Police Commissioner was the Chief of Police Affairs (警察局長, Ch'ikim or Chusaim rank), and below him were section chiefs (課長) for police affairs (警察), security (保安), accounting (會計), and interrogation (訊問), filled by Police Officers (警務官, equivalent to Police Superintendent/警視). The current Police Inspector (警部) was called "Ch'ongsul" (總巡), the Police Sergeant (巡査部長) was "Kwŏnim" (權任), and the Patrolman (巡査) was "Sun'gŏm" (巡檢). Granting official treatment (判任待遇) to ranks below Police Sergeant occurred only after the 2nd year of Yung Hŭi (隆熙, 1908). Furthermore, the qualifications and quality of patrolmen (巡檢) were much lower than today, so being a patrolman was mutually recognized as a kind of lowly occupation (賤役). Even respectable high officials and members of the gentry (兩班) typically addressed them with informal language ("haera" and "hage"), and the patrolmen themselves used self-deprecating terms like "soin" (小人, this humble person) or "chŏ" (저, I/me), completely opposite to the present day. Setting aside these digressions, a Police Commissioner who received King Kojong's trust and favor, rivaling Yi Kŭnt'aek of the Palace Guard Unit, was Kim Yŏngjun (金永準), also known as "Chŏgan" (隻眼, One-Eye). He was the son of Kim Pohyŏn (金輔鉉), a high minister killed in the Imo Military Mutiny (壬午軍擾). Though not from the primary wife, he came from a prestigious family (甲班名閥) and inherited influence from his father and ancestors. While possessing great intelligence, he was also known for greedy, cruel, and ruthless actions, allegedly plundering the people's wealth to flatter the king and make offerings. Consequently, he did not shy away from harsh punishments and unlawful killings, becoming an object of universal resentment (一世之怨府), treated like a snake or scorpion. Particularly, relatives and family members of those involved in so-called political crimes after the Kapsin Coup (甲申) (as the individuals themselves were either in exile or internal banishment) suffered extreme persecution, living in constant fear (惴惴慄慄) without vitality. It is said that even crying children at night would fall silent upon hearing the three syllables "Kim Yŏngjun." Even if we discount much of what his detractors said, it seems factual that he was a representative cruel official (酷吏) of the Korean era. Yet, even Kim "One-Eye" Yŏngjun, who wielded such immense power as Police Commissioner, once fell from favor. As slander from enemies and public denunciation began, the man who just yesterday had been shouting orders at subordinates in the Police Commissioner's office was arrested and imprisoned under unclear charges. He endured all sorts of torture (拷掠), and ultimately, his case was submitted to the throne proposing the death penalty. At this point, there is a tragic story resembling fiction. According to the law at the time, there were two types of death sentences: "beheading" (斬) and "strangulation" (絞). The Minister of Justice proposed beheading for him in a report submitted for royal decision ("伏候 聖裁"). Although King Kojong was angry for a time and had allowed the imprisonment and trial due to overwhelming public opinion (衆口難防), he initially had no intention of killing him. Furthermore, King Kojong was inherently compassionate and did not enjoy executing anyone. Therefore, when a proposal for the death penalty arrived, he often ordered a reduction by one degree (減一等), and on auspicious occasions, granted pardons and reinstatements numerous times. King Kojong, who possessed a memory rarely seen in the world, somehow forgot at that moment that strangulation followed beheading in severity, meaning reducing the sentence by one degree would still result in death. He failed to consider that he needed to reduce Kim Yŏngjun's sentence by two degrees from beheading to save his life. Moreover, the close attendants by his side,<107> originally hating Mr. Kim, unlike other times when they would eagerly compete to offer corrective advice and gain merit, did not utter a single word to remind the king upon hearing the decree "Reduce by one degree!" In a sense, they considered it heavenly fortune that it wasn't reduced by two degrees and relayed the decree as it was. The execution official, perhaps fearing King Kojong might regret and issue a revised order, carried out the strangulation immediately after the decree was announced and reported its completion to the Minister of Justice. King Kojong was astonished, asking, "Doesn't reducing a death sentence by one degree mean life imprisonment?" But with the clear legal code, what could be done? And since the man was already dead, even the power of a monarch was helpless in that matter. Kim Yŏngjun, whom the king tried to save but could not, was indeed the protagonist of a harsh and rugged fate.

In contrast to Kim Yŏngjun, a Police Commissioner who enjoyed a good reputation was, by anyone's account, Sin T'aehyu (申泰休) (the respected father of Mr. Sin Sŏgu (申錫雨), former president of the Chosun Ilbo), who passed away the year before last. Having grown up in poverty and endured various trials, he was a figure from a success story who achieved prominence entirely through self-reliance. He is said to have possessed the true mettle of a man who was firm, bright, honest, and upright, never flattering the powerful, and advancing according to his convictions. It is said that during his three terms as Police Commissioner, the atmosphere and character of the Police Bureau were finally renewed. The police agency began to fulfill its original mission, maintaining public order. Besides this, it strictly prohibited shamanistic rituals (巫卜之淫祀) and gambling among aristocrats and officials. It severely punished the bad habit of merchants cheating with weights and measures for illicit profit and the detrimental practice of common women adorning themselves with luxuries inappropriate to their status. Thus, the reality matched the name; the powerful and strong were restrained (豪强이 歛戰), and the chaotic and ugly public discipline, like a pandemonium of demons roaming in daylight (百鬼晝行), was rectified. Just as the police began to tread their proper path in this manner, the situation entered the era of the Russo-Japanese War. As Japanese influence returned to the level of the Kabo period, communication agencies were first entrusted [to Japan], followed by the sequential hiring of outstanding Japanese figures as advisors and councilors (參與官) in foreign affairs, finance, police, education, and military affairs. The Police Advisor at this time was Maruyama Shigetoshi (丸山重俊), who was the First Department Chief of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department. He came leading subordinates who were each worth a thousand warriors in the Japanese police world, such as Nagatani Takashi (永谷隆志), Kirihara Hikokichi (桐原彦吉), Iwai Keitarō (岩井敬太郞), Hamajima (?) (濱島尹松), Yobuko Tomoichirō (呼子友一郞), and Kunitomo Shōken (國友尙謙). After they assumed positions as assistants to the advisor, the Chosŏn police transformed, from one to ten, into something like a branch office of the Japanese Metropolitan Police Department. Subsequent Police Commissioners held only nominal titles, merely affixing their seals to documents. After the establishment of the Residency-General (統監府), the Police Commissioners I recall include Yun Ch'ŏlgyu (尹喆圭), Kim Samuk (金思黙), Kim Chaep'ung (金在豐), Yu Sŏngjun (兪星濬) (Acting), and Ku Yŏnsu (具然壽). As the political situation dictated, disturbances by righteous armies (義兵) and assassination plots against ministers and politicians were rampant everywhere, reaching their peak from July of the Chŏngmi year (丁未, 1907) to December of the Ŭlyu year (乙酉, 1909?). Setting other incidents aside, in the summer of Pyŏngo (丙午, 1906), Minister of War Yi Kŭnt'aek was wounded by an assassin at his concubine's house. In the early spring of Chŏngmi (1907), Pak Yonghwa (朴鏞和), former Vice Minister of the Imperial Household and then Chief of the Imperial Household Accounting Audit Bureau, was murdered in his home; the culprit was never apprehended. Also, in April of that year, Minister of War Kwŏn Chunghyŏn (權重顯) was shot with a pistol on a street in Sadong; this case was quickly uncovered,<108> and related individuals, including high officials like former Minister of Home Affairs Yi Yongt'ae (李容泰) and Vice Minister of Justice Min Hyŏngsik (閔衡植), were arrested and exiled. Furthermore, there were the overseas assassinations of former foreign advisor Stevens ("Suchibun" - 須知分) and former Resident-General Itō Hirobumi (伊藤博文公), and at the end of the Kiyu year (己酉, 1909), Prime Minister Yi Wanyong was stabbed in broad daylight. It was truly an era filled with murderous atmosphere (殺氣彌滿). Due to the Pak Yonghwa incident, Police Commissioner Kim Samuk received a salary cut and was subsequently dismissed along with the collapse of the Pak Chesun (朴齊純) cabinet. Mr. Kim was considered a figure second only to Mr. Sin [T'aehyu], known as a distinguished Police Commissioner. More than his skill, his character was that of a very noble gentleman (君子人). During the Yi Wanyong cabinet, Yu Sŏngjun initially served as Acting Police Commissioner while being Vice Minister of Home Affairs. He was the younger brother of Kudang Yu Kilchun (矩堂 兪吉濬氏) and passed away recently, a well-known elder. Moreover, his tenure as Acting Police Commissioner lasted barely less than a month, so there isn't much to say. Following him, Kim Chaep'ung, the Governor of Kangwŏn Province, became the official Police Commissioner, returning as the master of the Police Bureau he had left 7 or 8 years prior. In July of Chŏngmi (1907), the issue of King Kojong's abdication arose from the Hague Secret Emissary Affair (海牙 密使事件). The sentiment in the capital became agitated (恟恟), leading to the infamous riots at Taehanmun Gate and Chongno (鍾路 暴動), and the arson attack on Yi Wanyong's residence in Yakhyŏn (藥峴), turning the capital into a scene of carnage (修羅巷). He took responsibility for being "unable to suppress the rioting populace" (亂民 不能鎭定) and was dismissed from office under disciplinary action along with the Mayor of Hansŏng (漢城府尹), Pak Ŭibyŏng (朴義秉). Although he came from a military family (將門) and spent his life in military service, he appeared outwardly as a good-natured gentleman, refined and unassuming (儒雅淡白), perhaps unsuitable as the head of police during turbulent times.

Succeeding Mr. Kim was the famous Ku Yŏnsu (具然壽), who leaped from being the Magistrate of Ulto County (蔚島郡守) to be appointed Police Commissioner. Hailing from a coastal surveillance post family (監戶 出身) in South Kyŏngsang Province, he had early on entered the service of Pak Yŏnghyo (朴永孝), serving as both attendant (傔從) and guard (衛卒). He followed Pak into exile during the Kapsin Coup (甲申政變). After returning to Korea in the Kabo year (甲午年), thanks to having graduated from the metallurgy department of mining studies learned in Sado, Niigata Prefecture (新瀉縣佐渡) during his exile, he was serving as an engineer (技師) in the Ministry of Agriculture, Commerce, and Industry (農商工部) when he met Song Pyŏngjun (宋秉畯). Gaining his favor, he received significant appointments alongside him. Having grown up in a remote place (遐曲生長), his speech and actions were extremely rough, wild, and unrestrained. His appearance was also imposing, with a large build, broad face, and protruding eyes (巨軀廣顔에 兩眼이 突出), a man of high status yet completely untamed. However, his personality was extremely innocent, with child-like aspects (嬰兒같은 點), and while straightforward and impulsive (直情逕行), he was not entirely without some kindness. In essence, that he, a relatively good and decent person, became a Yama King-like Police Commissioner was itself a miracle. While he held the position, the Japan-Korea Police Merger (日韓警務合同) was established in September of Chŏngmi (1907). As Advisor Maruyama became Superintendent General (警視總監), Mr. Ku was demoted to Vice Superintendent General (副監), and the title of Police Commissioner, which had existed for 13 years, disappeared entirely. Meanwhile, Dr. Matsui Shigeru(?) (松井荗), an authority in Japanese police, was hired as the Director of Police Affairs in the Home Ministry (內部警務局長). The police organization finally reached a state of legal completion. Just before the annexation (倂合), Korea's police authority was entirely entrusted to the Residency-General. The Gendarmerie Commander (憲兵司令官), Major General Akashi Motojirō (明石元二郞), concurrently served as the Director General of Police Affairs (警務總長), ushering in the so-called Gendarmerie Police (憲兵警察) era. After four Directors General—Tachibana Koichirō (立花小一郞), Furuumi Izushio(?) (古海嚴潮), and Kojima Sōjirō(?) (兒島摠次郞)—the system changed to the current one with the governmental reorganization in the Kimi year (己未年, 1919). With this addendum, I conclude this dry, clumsy, and expectation-defying manuscript. <109>

**Summary**

The author, Hong Mokch'un, recounts the history of the Korean Police Commissioner (Kyŏngmusa) position from its inception during the Kabo Reforms (1894) until its abolition with the Japan-Korea Police Merger (1907). Despite initial disclaimers of ignorance, he details the origins of the modern police system, replacing the older P'odoch'ŏng, the rapid turnover of commissioners due to political instability, and the fluctuating power dynamics between the Police Bureau, the Palace Guard Unit (Kyŏngwiwŏn), and influential figures favored by King Kojong. He contrasts the notorious cruelty of Kim Yŏngjun ("One-Eye") with the reputed integrity of Sin T'aehyu, discusses the increasing Japanese influence culminating in Japanese advisors effectively running the police, and mentions key incidents like assassinations and riots during the turbulent period leading up to the formal annexation. The article concludes by noting the transition to the Gendarmerie Police system under the Japanese Residency-General. From a historical perspective, the article offers valuable insights into the internal workings and perceived atmosphere of the late Chosŏn/Korean Empire's police apparatus during a period of intense political upheaval and colonization. The author's personal commentary, anecdotes about specific commissioners like Kim Yŏngjun and Sin T'aehyu, and the description of institutional changes (like the Kyŏngwiwŏn and the police merger) provide a contemporary viewpoint on the erosion of Korean sovereignty and the consolidation of Japanese control over internal security forces.

人世의 閻羅王 歷代警務使 이약이, 甲午로부터, 現時까지
						洪木春
三千里社主幹 足下 前月號 誌上에 『倂合當時 十三道 觀察使의 其后』를 써보라 하시기에 자세히 알지는 못하나마 녯 記憶을 차저 두어 마듸 胡亂塞責을 하얏드니 足下는 本是 筆者로써 當時 官界의 事情과 그 裡面을 曉解하는 사람으로 誤認하섯는지 今回에는 『韓國時代의 警務使이야기』를 一編 提供하라고 鄭重하신 付記를 내리섯스나 이것은 失禮이지만은 足下의 認識 不足으로 생각합니다. 警務使라는 官職이 생긴 것이 開國 503年 卽 高宗  甲午의 更張 당시의 일로 지금으로부터 40年前 事인즉 그때 襁褓에 싸혀 잇든 乳兒의 筆者로 무엇을 알 수 잇스며 또 甲午로부터 丁未에까지 伊來 14,5년간에 當時 走馬燈처럼 朝夕으로 翻覆되든 政局에 處하야 一年이면 十餘次이나 政權의 更迭이 잇섯고 따러서 警務使된 사람의 數爻도 少하야 사오십名은 될 것이오. 그 中에는 三日 警務使은 姑捨하고 行公하기 前에 遞差된 사람도 잇섯스며 一人으로서 二三次 乃至 五六次의 任命된 사람도 잇슨즉 좀더 切實하게 말하자면 그때의 政府가 繁昌한 旅館과 맛찬가지로 大臣과 高官의 出入이 넘우 頻數하야 宿泊薄를 溯考하기 前에는<104> 엇던 손님이 언제 단녀간 것을 갈피잡지 못하는 것과 가티 警務廳의 先生案 (奮時代에는 官衙마다 先生案이란 것이 備置되여 官員의 變動이 잇슬 때마다 記入하든 것) 을 보기 前에는 아무리 典故에 精한 老人이 잇서도 記憶 뿐으로는 자세치 못할 것인데 허물며 筆者같은 사람으로야 무엇을 아노라고 한 것이며 또 한가지는 比較的 연대가 멀지 아니하니만티 曾經警務使의 老大官으로 아즉도 生存한 이가 업지 안이하고 비록作故하얏다」하야도 그 子孫과 親知가 그득히 남어잇는 今日에 善惡은 別問題로 하고 人物批評에 갓가운 文字는 經遽히 쓰지 안는 것이 우리 社會의 禮儀로 생각합니다. 그리고 보면 아무리 付託이 잇다하야도 辭避하는 것이 올타하야 『고도와리』할 答狀을 써노왓섯습니다. 그리다가 貴書를 다시 翻檢한 즉 原稿 締切 期日이 一兩日에 不過한 貌樣이니 이것도 足下의 發信하신 것이 期限臨迫한 때에 張飛의 軍令처럼 餘裕업시 내리신 所致오 筆者에게 責任引受할 義務가 업다할 것이지만은 一邊 다시 생각하면 이만 사람에게 무엇인지 쓰라고 年來로 一再안인 勸求가 잇스심에 拜面치 못하든 때부터 感激비슷한 一種의 늣김을 가지고 그 好意에 酬謝하랴는 생각이 잇는 외에 一二次 拜眉 後로는 더욱 그 마음이 깁허 援助는 못하나마 支障을 드리랴 십지 안어서 이 글을 쓰는 것이올시다. 事情이 이러함으로 當初에 要求하신『勢力비祕話 같은 것은 全然히 闕하고(모르는 까닭에) 年代의 順位라든지 先生案과 같은 名薄도 省留하야 버리고 아래와 같은 無味亂雜한 文字를 羅列하게 되엿습니다. 머리ㅅ말이 넘어長遑하야 더욱 未安하지만은 이것도 紙面의 行數를 늘니자는 計略에서 나온 것을 笑諒하시면 至幸이외다

閑話休提, 지금부터 警務使 이약이를 쓰랴합니다. 朝鮮에 警察官이란 衙門과 官吏가 생긴 것은 前述과 갗이 甲午更張에 創始된 것이오. 녯날에 그와 類似한 것은 京城에는 左, 右, 捕廷이 잇서 左捕廳은 지금 團成社 뒤에 잇고 右捕廳은 現 光化門 郵便局 자리인데 各히 捕盜大將이라는 首腦者를 두어 從二品 이상의 武官으로 專任 或 兼補하게 되고 그 아래에 軍官과 捕校가 잇서 警視, 警部. 巡査와 같은 任務에 服하고 大將은 官制上으로 義禁府堂上을 例兼하야 威權이 實로 當當한 것입니다. 그리고 地方에는 各道에 三四處, 乃至 六七處의 鎭營을 두고 그곳에 營將이 잇서 只今으로는 警察部長格으로 直轄巡校를 指揮하는 外에 管下에 牧使, 府使, 郡守, 縣令, 懸監 等 地方官 아래에 配置된 巡校를 統制하얏습니다 그리다가 甲午年에 니르러 政府은 日本으로부터 武久警視를 招聘하야 警務顧問을 삼고 비로소 舊日 捕廳의 任務 外에 現代式 警察制度를 採用하고 그 首腦官인 警務使는 內務大臣(다음에는 內部大臣)의 管轄 下에 옴겨 純然한 文官으로 삼엇습니다. 武官 出身으로 警務使된 이가 數爻는 만흐나 官制의 原則은 文官으로 된 것) 그리하야 趙羲淵, 安馹壽, 權瀅鎭, 李允用, 李鍾健,<105>閔泳綺 같은 이들이 初期時代의 警務使가 되엿다 합니다. 그리고 鄭洛鎔, 尹雄烈, 許璡, 張基濂, 閔景植, 白性基, 李忠求 等 諸氏 도 先後하야 任官된 듯 함니다. 그 中에도 權氏는 乙未年 明成后事變 當時의 警務使로 關係가 깁흔 것은 언제인가 本誌에도 그의 令弟되는 權東鎭氏 追懷談이 실녀잇든 것 갓습니다. 五百年 君主專制의 나라에서 별안간에 現時 立憲君主制에 비슷한 政體(立法하는 議院은 업지만)를 採用하얏스니 그 政體에 누구보다도 不滿과 不便을 늣기신 이가 高宗 그 어른이섯습니다. 그리고 甲午改革이란 것이 元來 xx의 忠告와 干涉에 專由한 것이오. 高宗의 御意에서 생긴 것이 아니든지만티 日淸戰後의 三國干涉으로부터 日本의 東亞에 대한 地位가 變함을 따러 高宗의 態度가 一變하섯습니다. 所謂 乙未事變도 그 原因은 이에서 생긴 것이오. 繼續하야 『俄館播遷』의 일이 잇슨 後로 政情은 甲午前으로 逆轉하야 袁世凱, 井上馨의 代로 露國公使 『韋貝』가 그의 强大한 國力을 등지고 隱然히 이 나라의 政治를 暗中에서 指揮하얏습니다. 그런데 韋貝는 누구보다도 高宗의 歡心을 사기에 專力하얏고 高宗은 露國의 後援 下에 强固한 君權을 回復하랴 하섯습니다. 그럼으로 形式어나마 內閣의 責任政治란 것은 金弘集 內閣의 顚覆으로 終未을 告하고 最後의 李完用 內閣이 出現되기까지는 純粹한 皇帝任意의 帝權黃金時代가 10여 년을 一貫하얏스며 따러서 內外의 大小官吏가 一도 宮中의 意思대로 任免되지 만은 것이 업고 議政府 이하의 官衙는 오즉 奉行機關됨에 不過하얏습니다. 政府가 名色으로 잇슬 뿐이오. 大臣이 輔弼의 責을 實地로 盡할 수 업슨즉 그들은 旅進旅退하면서 至尊으로 하야금 社稷을 獨憂케 하다가 無事하면 榮位와 高祿을 貪하고 有故하면 閉戶不出하야 『吾不關焉』이라 하게 되엿습니다. 이 時代가 日露戰役 終局時까지 連續하야 頻繁한 때에는 一朔에도 二三次의 政府更迭과 高官의 進退가 잇서든 期間입니다. 當時 警務廳에 奉織하든 老使丁의 實話에 依하면 使道의 顔面은 姑捨하고 그 私邸에 待令하기 前에 벌서 遞任된 일이 여러 차례라 하든 것으로 可히 그 一斑을 卜知할 것이외다.

光武 3,4년경인 듯합니다. 一時는 警務廳을 昇格하야 警部大臣을 누게 되엿다가 未久에 仍舊한 일도 잇고 또 警務廳 이외에 宮中에 『警衛院』이라는 皇帝直隷의 特設官衙을 設置하고 高宗의 寵臣이든 故 子爵 李根澤이가 오래 그 마을의 總管이 되여 曾往의 扈衛大將과 判義禁府事같은 勢威를 手中에 잡고잇든 일이 잇섯다 합니다. 이 警衛院은 伊藤統監時代의 宮禁肅淸 前後에 廢止되고 主殿院이란 宮內大臣 管轄의 實署가 생겨 皇宮警衛의 일에 當하다가 丁未年에는 警視廳에 移管되엿스나 一時는 警務使 이상의 權力이 잇서 『令警衛院拘拿懲辨』의 旨意가 내리면 비록 議政大臣이라도 즉각 捉來하든 勢力衙門이오. 惡口者는 『大闕 안의 私設監獄』이라고 부르든 곳이며 法部大臣으로도 손을 대이지 못하얏습니다.<106> 警務廳 巡檢은 白線 두룬 制服을 着用함에 反하야 警衛院 巡檢은 黃線制帽를 쓰고 服色부터 皇帝直隷를 意味하엿습니다. 말하자면 그때의 警務廳은 竊盜나 잡고 도박과 酗酒를 禁하는 일을 할 뿐이오 所謂 高等警察에 屬한 것은 全然히 參涉치 못하얏습니다.
이 機會에 말할 것은 그때 行政과 司法 二權이 混同無別함으로 監獄署도 警務廳에서 句管하얏고 警務使가 裁判官의 일도 하얏다 합니다. 警務使의 아래에 警察局長 勅任 或 奏任)이 잇고 또 그 아래에 警察, 保安, 會計, 訊問 等 課長이 잇서 警務官(警視)으로 補하고 現制의 警部는 『總巡』 巡査部長은 『權任』 巡査는 『巡檢』이라 하얏고 巡査部長 이하에게 判任待遇를 준 것도 隆熙 2년 이후입니다. 그리고 巡檢의 資格과 素質도 지금보다 몹시 低級임으로 巡檢 다니는 것을 一種의 賤役으로 自他가 共認하야 왼만한 大官과 兩班은 依例로 『해라』와 『하게』의 말을 쓰고 巡檢自身도 『小人』이니 『저』니 自稱하야 現時와는 全然 反對입니다. 餘談은 그만두고 李根澤의 警衛院總管에지지 안케 警務使로서 高宗께 信寵밧든 사람은 金永準이란 이로 別名 『隻眼』(외눈까리)이라 하든 사람입니다. 그는 壬午軍擾에 被殺된 重臣 金輔鉉의 아들로 嫡出은 아니로되 甲班名閥의 出身이오 父祖 以來의 勢權도 잇섯습니다. 才智가 만튼 反面에는 貪虐殘酷한 處事가 만허 民財를 攘奪하야 謟君供上하기를 일삼엇다 합니다. 그러자니 酷刑濫殺도 업지안엇고 一世의 怨府가 되여 蛇蝎처럼 取扱될 것도 免치 못할 것이 외다. 더욱이 甲申 이후의 所謂 國事犯 關係者의 親知家屬 (當者들은 亡命치 안엇스면 流配 中임으로)들이 非常한 迫害을 밧어 惴惴慄慄하야 生氣가 업섯고 金永準의 三字만 드르면 夜啼하든 小兒도 소리를 내지 못하얏다 합니다. 그를 毁斥하는 사람들의 말을 大部分은 割引할지라도 韓國時代의 代表的 酷吏이든 것은 事實인 듯합니다. 그러한 혁혁한 勢威를 가젓든 金隻眼 警務使도 一次上寵이 쇠하고 仇敵들의 讒傷과 聲討가 始作되매 昨日까지 警務使의 官房에서 部下를 叱咤하든 身分으로 理由 未分明한 罪名으로 就縛入獄하야 가즌 拷掠을 當하고 畢竟은 極刑으로 擬律上奏하게 되엿습니다. 여긔에서 小說같은 悲話가 잇스니 그때 法文에 死刑은 『斬,絞』의 二種이 잇는데 法部大臣 그를 斬刑에 擬하야 『伏候 聖裁라는 奏本을 밧첫습니다. 高宗은 一時는 비록 怒하섯고 또 衆口難防으로 엇절 수 업시 下獄論刑케 하섯스나 當初부터 죽이실 意思가 업스시고 또 高宗 그 어른이 本來부터 慈柔하오서 누구든지 죽이기를 즐기지 안으섯습니다. 그럼으로 死刑奏本이 오르면 흔히 減一等을 命하섯다가 慶事가 잇스면 恩赦과 復職을 하신 일이 여러 번 잇섯습니다. 世上에도 稀有의 强記力을 가즈신 高宗이 엇지되신 일인지 그때에 斬刑의 다음에 絞刑이 잇서 一等을 감하야도 죽기는 一般인 것을 깜짝이 니즈시고 金永準의 斬刑奏本에 二等을 감하여야 살녀 내실 것을 생각치 못하섯습니다. 그리고 侍側한 近臣도<107> 원체 金氏를 끼워하든 까닭에 다른 때 같으면 앞을 다토와 補檼獻功함에 不拘하고 『減一等하라』시는 批旨에 대하야 一言으로써 上의 記憶을 喚起하야 드리지 안코 엇던 意味로는 減二等 안된 것을 天幸으로 녁여 그대로 宣下하얏스며 執行官도 또한 高宗의 追悔와 再處分이 잇슬가 두려하얏든지 宣下 즉각으로 絞刑을 執行하고 法相으로부터 이 뜻을 回奏하얏습니다. 高宗이 愕然하오서 『死刑에 一等을 減하면 終身懲役이 아니란 말이냐』 하섯스나 明白한 法文이 잇는데야 엇지하시며 또 그 사람이 임의 죽엇스니 아무리 人君의 威力이라도 그 일만은 無可奈何이섯슴니다. 인군이 살니자 하야도 不能하는 金永準은 果然 險惡하고 崎嶇한 八字의 主人公이엿슴니다.

金永準과 반대로 好評이 잇든 警務使로는 누가 보든지 再昨年에 作故한 申泰休 (前 朝鮮日報社長 申錫雨氏의 嚴父) 그이이시다. 그는 貧困 中에서 生長하야 여러 가지 試鍊을 치르고 徹頭徹尾, 自力으로 榮達을 致한 立志傳 中의 人物이니만티 剛明廉直하야 權勢에 阿치 안코 所信에 邁進하든 男兒의 眞骨頭를 가젓든 사람이라 합니다. 그가 警務使의 職에 三任하는 가운대 警務廳의 空氣와 面目이 비로소 一新하얏다 합니다. 警察機關이 그 本來의 使命을 發揮하야 治安을 維持하는 이외에 巫卜의 淫祀와 貴族, 官吏들의 賭博을 痛禁하얏스며 商人들의 度量衡을 속여 不正의 利를 貪하는 惡習과 閭巷婦人들이 身分 不相當한 奢侈의 粧飾하는 弊害를 嚴懲하야 名實이 共히 豪强이 歛戰되고 百鬼晝行의 亂醜한 綱紀를 肅正하얏슴니다. 이와 갗이 警察이 그 本然의 軌道를 밥기 始作하든 때에 時局은 日露戰爭 시대로 드러가게 되고 日本의 勢力이 甲午當時로 다시 廻轉하면서부터 通信機關이 먼저 委任되고 外交, 財政, 警察, 學政, 軍事에 顧問과 參與官으로 日本의 優秀한 人物들이 次第로 聘用되엿슴니다. 이 때의 警務顧問은 警視廳 第一部長으로 在職中이든 丸山重俊이가 와서 永谷隆志, 桐原彦吉, 岩井敬太郞, 濱島尹松, 呼子友一郞, 國友尙謙 等의 日本警察界에서 一騎當千하든 部下를 引率하고 顧問의 補佐員으로 就任한 뒤로부터 朝鮮의 警察은 一에서 十까지 日本警視廳의 分室 가티 變化하얏스며 그 後의 警務使는 虛名을 띄고 文書捺印할 뿐이엿나니다. 統監府時代된 뒤의 警務使로는 筆者의 記憶으로는 尹喆圭, 金思黙, 金在豐, 兪星濬(代辨) 具然壽 等이 잇섯는 듯 한데 政局이 政局이든이 만티 各處에 義兵騷亂, 大臣과 政客의 暗殺陰謀가 盛行하고 그것이 丁未 七月로부터 乙酉 十二月까지가 最高潮이엿슴니다. 다른 것은 그만두고 丙午 여름에 軍部大臣 李根澤이 妾의 집에서 刺客에게 被傷되고 丁未 早春에는 前宮內協辦으로 그때 帝室會計審査長官이든 朴鏞和가 自宅에서 被殺하얏는데 犯人을 終始 逮捕치 못하고 또 그해 4月에 軍部大臣 權重顯이 寺洞 路上에서 拳銃의 發射를 밧엇는데 그것은 곳 發覺되여<108> 關聯者로 前內部大臣 李容泰, 法部協辦 閔衡植 等의 大官까지 檢擧 流配되엿스며 前外交顧問 須知分』과 前統監 伊藤博文公의 海外遭難과 己酉 歲未에 首相 李完用의 白晝被刺 等 實로 殺氣彌滿하든 時代이엿슴니다. 朴보和 事件으로 金思黙警務使가 罰俸을 밧고 仍하야 朴齊純 內閣 瓦解와 함께 罷免되엿는데 金氏는 申氏에게 亞할 人物로 名 警務使의 稱이 잇섯스며 그 手腕보다도 人格이 매우 高潔하든 君子人이엿슴니다. 李完用內閣時에는 처음에 兪星濬이가 內部協辦으로 警務使를 代理하얏는데 그는 矩堂 兪吉濬氏의 令弟로 最近에 作故하야 世上에서 熟知하든 老人일 뿐 아니라 代理 警務使로 더욱 在任도 僅히 一朔 미만인즉 別로 말할 것이 업슴니다. 그 다음에는 金在豐이란 이가 江原道 觀察使로 正式警務使가 되여 7,8年前에 다녀간 警務廳에 二次 主人公이 되엿드니 丁未 7月에 海牙 密使事件으로부터 高宗의 讓位問題가 생기고 都下의 人心이 恟恟하야 例의 大漢門과 鍾路 暴動이 니러나며 藥峴에 잇든 李完用邸 燒打가 잇서 京城이 修羅巷으로 化하얏슬 때에 그는 『亂民 不能鎭定』의 責任을 지고 漢城府尹 朴義秉과 함께 懲戒免官을 當하얏슴니다. 그는 비록 將門의 出身으로 一生을 軍籍에서 보엿스나 外貌부터 良善한 紳士로 儒雅淡白하야 亂時의 警察 首腦者로는 適任이 안인 듯합니다.

金氏의 後를 襲하야 蔚島郡守로 一躍하야 警務使에 擢用된 사람이 有名한 具然壽올시다. 그는 慶南 海邊의 監戶 出身으로 일즉이 朴永孝의 門下에 投入하야 傔從과 衛卒을 兼하얏고 甲申政變에 朴氏를 따러 亡命하얏다가 甲午年에 歸國한 뒤 亡命時代에 新瀉縣佐渡에서 배운 鑛山學의 冶金科를 卒業한 關係로 農商工部의 技師로 奉職 中에 宋秉畯과 알게 되면서 그의 知遇를 밧어 그와 갗이 重用된 것입니다. 그는 遐曲生長이니만티 言語動作이 極히 粗野豪放하고 風采도 巨軀廣顔에 兩眼이 突出하야 堂堂한 代身으로 野生 그대로 된 사람입니다. 그러나 爲人은 極히 無邪氣하야 嬰兒같은 點이 잇고 直情逕行이면서도 若干의 親切味도 업지 안엇슴니다. 要하건대 比較的 善人이요 好人이든 그 사람이 閻羅王같은 警務使된 것도 奇蹟이거니와 그리는 동안에 丁未 9月에 日韓警務合同이 成立하야 丸山顧問이 警視總監으로 就任하면서 具氏는 副監으로 내려안고 13年間 存在하든 警務使는 職名부터 업서젓스며 一方으로 內部警務局長은 日本警察의 權威者인 松井荗 博士가 聘用되여 警察機關은 비로소 法頓完成의 域에 達하얏으며 倂合 直前에는 韓國의 警察機關이 全혀 統監府에 委任되여 憲兵司令官이든 明石元二郞 少將이 一方으로 警務總長을 兼하야 所謂 憲兵警察時代를 出現하야 立花小一郞, 古海嚴潮, 兒島摠次郞 等의 四代 總長을 지내다가 己未年 官制政正과 함께 現時制度로 된 겄을 附記하고 期待에 어근나고 乾燥無拙한 本稿를 擱筆합니다. <109>
