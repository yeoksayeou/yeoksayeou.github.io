岡田內閣의 成立과 展望
						李蒙
Nowadays, regardless of gender or age, everyone calls the present time an "Emergency Period." So, what is an Emergency Period? The Emergency Period refers to crises such as the Manchurian Problem, the economic depression, the rise of fascism (팟쇼 擡頭), the conclusion of the Washington and London Treaties, the withdrawal from the League of Nations, and accompanying issues like the South Seas Mandate problem, the maturation of Soviet Russia's (싸베-트러시아) Second Five-Year Plan, and so on. The previous Saitō Cabinet was the so-called Emergency Period Cabinet meant to overcome the aforementioned Emergency Period. Therefore, it is also true that if the Emergency Period had been resolved, the rationale for the Saitō Cabinet's existence would have also disappeared. However, the recent collapse of the Saitō Cabinet was not due to the resolution of the Emergency Period, but purely due to disciplinary issues (綱紀問題), and the current situation still urgently demands an Emergency Period Cabinet. Mr. Okada, who was the Navy Minister in the Saitō Cabinet, was truly acting as a deputy prime minister and fulfilling the role of a trusted confidant. Amidst reasons such as reaching the retirement age and budget reductions for the military, he resigned. At that time, political circles both in and out of government speculated that Navy Minister Okada's resignation meant the immediate collapse of the Saitō Cabinet, and some politicians even said he resigned on the condition of taking over the next cabinet. Was this indeed true? In any case, it is a fact that if Mr. Saitō was the Commander-in-Chief of the Saitō ship, Mr. Okada was the Chief of Staff. Thus, there is nothing strange about Mr. Okada becoming the head of a cabinet that is like a cousin to the Saitō Cabinet. Moreover, facing the crisis of 1935-36, it seems appropriate that he, a Navy Admiral, became Prime Minister. When the disciplinary issue of the Ministry of Finance scandal (大藏省疑獄事件) came to the fore, even though it was an Emergency Period Cabinet, it reached a situation where resignation was unavoidable. Prime Minister Saitō, after careful consideration regarding the head of the successor cabinet and in view of the gravity of the times, sought to install Mr. Okada, a veteran of the Navy whom he himself trusted. He summoned Agriculture Minister Gotō and consulted him, asking for his help in advising Mr. Okada on organizing the successor cabinet. On the other hand, he communicated his intentions to Prince Saionji through Baron Harada, and also strongly recommended Mr. Okada to the elders Takahashi and Yamamoto. Amidst various behind-the-scenes maneuvers and public movements, including rumors of Saitō's reappointment or proposals for Ugaki, Hiranuma, or Yamamoto, the imperial command to form a cabinet descended upon Mr. Okada, aligning with the intentions of the genrō (elder statesmen) and senior vassals. At that time, the Seiyūkai, the majority party, immediately insisted that the next cabinet should be <38> a party cabinet, seeking to gain political power. However, since the Emergency Period was not resolved with the collapse of the Saitō Cabinet, the emergence of a second Emergency Period Cabinet was practically inevitable. If the Emergency Period had been resolved, the Emergency Period Cabinet would naturally have been dissolved as well. Therefore, if the Seiyūkai wishes to grasp political power through the normal path of party politics, it must first strive to resolve the Emergency Period. Contrary to the Seiyūkai, the Minseitō promptly expressed its intention to cooperate (reportedly, during the meeting of senior statesmen, Baron Wakatsuki was the first to support Mr. Okada). The Army side expressed some opposition, demanding the abolition of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs (拓務省) and the appointment of General Araki as a minister. Furthermore, even within the Navy, Mr. Okada was called a member of the so-called "London Treaty weak faction," and thus faced opposition. With opposition from the majority party Seiyūkai, the Army, and a part of the Navy, there was considerable public attention focused on whether the Okada Cabinet would become the second stillborn cabinet. However, negotiations for the entry of Mr. Tokonami from the Seiyūkai succeeded, and fortunately, it was not stillborn, but rather, after a very difficult birth, the so-called Second Okada Emergency Period Cabinet was established on the 5th of last month. Now, what ripples has this Okada Cabinet, organized amidst such difficulty, created in Japan's political world? I believe that the theory that overcoming the Emergency Period must necessarily be carried out by the hands of Army and Navy personnel cannot be logically or common-sensically established. In Japan's political system, which is a parliamentary system, the fact that we see a second non-party cabinet (超然內閣) headed by a military figure, despite the clear existence of political parties, even if attributed to the special circumstance of the Emergency Period, cannot but be seen as reaching an extreme in ignoring the existence of political parties. In today's political climate, no matter how many representatives a party holds, it must bend its principles to get its members into the cabinet, which truly evokes a sense of profound change (桑田碧海). However, in reality, the current political parties, whether Seiyūkai or Minseitō, have not been unrelated to disciplinary issues. Moreover, ministers purely from party backgrounds are often ignorant of the realities of the Army and Navy, and they seem more focused on expanding their own party's influence than on being loyal to the state.<39> The fact that we cannot see a party cabinet in an era of party politics can be considered evidence of the transition from party politics to military politics. If it's an Emergency Period, it's not unique to Japan; the world powers are commonly facing an Emergency Period. How long will the lifespan of this Emergency Period extend? In any case, it seems certain to be long-term. In that case, in this long-term Emergency Period, what is the existence of political parties if not effectively that of scarecrows? Will the fact that today's Seiyūkai or Minseitō manage to get 2 or 3 members into the cabinet become problematic in the future? If the time comes when Colonial Affairs, Education, and Finance must all be grasped by the military, what use will political parties serve then? Perhaps they will be satisfied with appointing vice-ministers or parliamentary officials? In any case, with the establishment of the Second Okada Emergency Period Cabinet, I dare assert that parliamentary politics has encountered a crisis, and simultaneously, the existence of political parties becomes meaningless. Furthermore, the Seiyūkai, which was the majority party, now faces the crisis of an actual split; this too cannot but be called a gift from the Okada Cabinet. Although formally, Messrs. Tokonami, Yamazaki, and Uchida have entered the cabinet as members of the Seiyūkai, in substance, it is limited to the Satsuma faction lineage. This can be clearly seen from the fact that the Seiyūkai's top leadership opposed their entry into the cabinet and carried out expulsion measures. The Seiyūkai's stance towards the Okada Cabinet is said to have been declared as follows:
"Although the new cabinet wears the mask of national unity (擧國一致), it is in reality an expression of bureaucratism (官僚主義) that ignores parties based on popular will and tries to make political parties its running dogs. This is clear even from observing the process of cabinet formation. It is the revival of an old-style bureaucratic cabinet not based on the popular will. Because of this, it is as clear as day that the people will suffer from the evils of bureaucracy. Particularly, luring political parties with the bait of increasing cabinet seats without any policy whatsoever is the method of the ugly politics that repeatedly appeared during the Ōura Incident and the past bureaucratic era; it is truly the resurgence of a despicable policy and a disregard for the people. Therefore, it is unqualified to bear the burden of the Emergency Period, and the main reason our party decided by party resolution not to send ministers into the cabinet lies precisely here. As our party has declared to the world, based on the fundamental policy of prioritizing the state and policy, we will independently contribute to the progress of the nation's destiny from this standpoint and monitor the actions of the government." Through this statement, the Seiyūkai's attitude towards the Okada Cabinet is already proven. They are directly raising the banner of opposition, centering on Okada's statement immediately after receiving the mandate to form the cabinet that he "has no policy yet" and the issue of the entry of the Tokonami faction. Simultaneously, we see the split of the great Seiyūkai as imminent. In my opinion, Admiral Okada's statement that he had no policy yet was made with the true intention of consulting the cabinet members before announcing it. In reality, there must have been sufficient discussion about policy between him and former Prime Minister Saitō. Army Minister Hayashi, Navy Minister Ōsumi, and Foreign Minister Hirota are retained ministers. Finance Minister Fujii is also said to be a "Second Takahashi," implying he will inevitably follow the policies of former Finance Minister Takahashi. Since the Okada Cabinet's first step in policy is said to be discussing important policies centered around a five-minister conference including Ōsumi, Hayashi, Fujii, and Hirota, aside from purging discipline (綱紀肅情) and unilateralism (一方主義), it will follow the Saitō Cabinet's policies<40> as they are. Retained Home Minister Gotō will also follow the policies of former Home Minister Yamamoto as they are. Therefore, one cannot have special expectations for the Okada Cabinet. If the distinctive feature of the Okada Cabinet is that important policies are discussed centering on the aforementioned five non-party ministers, then it is also a fact that party-affiliated ministers like Tokonami, Machida, Matsuda, and Uchida will ultimately be subservient to the aforementioned five-minister conference. Finally, will the Okada Cabinet be a long-lived cabinet or a short-lived one? Barring any special political upheaval, I dare assert that the Okada Cabinet will be a long-lived cabinet. Even if there is opposition from the majority party Seiyūkai and part of the Army, it will likely try to overcome the crisis of 1935-36 through the Okada Cabinet, in accordance with the wishes of the genrō and senior statesmen. Regarding the crisis in question, one cannot but hesitate to speak clearly. In any case, it seems likely that Japan's political situation will have the current cabinet face the 1935-36 crisis. A head-on collision with the Seiyūkai is a matter of time, and the dissolution of the upcoming Diet has become an inevitable situation. As the revision period for the naval treaty approaches in Shōwa 11 (1936), this is seen as the most crucial aspect of foreign policy. Accordingly, the budget for that year is considered most important. Therefore, it is a fact that they are determined to dissolve the House of Representatives (衆議院) by convening an extraordinary Diet session at an appropriate time this autumn, clarifying the political party landscape in the House, fulfilling the current cabinet's greatest mission, and simultaneously preparing for the Washington Conference in Shōwa 10 (1935), in order to become a truly national unity cabinet or to create an opportunity for the emergence of an even stronger cabinet. Thus, the political situation is perhaps stabilizing. July 12th<41>

**Summary**

This 1934 article by Yi Mong analyzes the formation of the Okada Keisuke cabinet in Japan, succeeding the Saitō Makoto cabinet which collapsed due to scandal, not the resolution of the ongoing "Emergency Period." Yi argues that despite being the second consecutive cabinet led by a military figure (Admiral Okada), the underlying crises (Manchurian Incident fallout, naval treaty renegotiations, economic issues) persist. He critiques the weakening of parliamentary democracy and party politics, noting the military and bureaucracy's growing influence, forcing even the majority Seiyūkai party to compromise or face irrelevance/splits (as seen with the Tokonami faction joining Okada). Yi predicts the Okada cabinet will be long-lived, tasked with navigating the critical 1935-36 period (naval conferences), will likely dissolve the Diet to consolidate power, and will largely continue the policies of its predecessor, centering power around key non-party ministers (Navy, Army, Finance, Foreign Affairs).

From the perspective of Korean colonial history, this article is interesting as it provides a contemporary Korean intellectual's view (Yi Mong) on the political shifts in the ruling colonial power, Japan. It highlights the erosion of civilian party control and the rise of militarism/bureaucracy in Tokyo, trends that directly impacted colonial governance and intensified Japan's expansionist policies, including in Korea and Manchuria. The focus on the "Emergency Period," naval treaties, and the prediction of a stronger, potentially authoritarian, cabinet reflects the anxieties and political realities of the era leading up to wider conflict, as observed from within the Japanese empire.

岡田內閣의 成立과 展望
						李蒙
지금은 男女老幼 업시 現今을 非常時라고 일카른다. 그러면 非常時란 무엇인가? 非常時란 滿洲問題 財界不況 팟쇼 擡頭 華盛頓及 倫敦兩條約의 締結 聯盟脫退 完全에 伴한 南洋委任統治問題 싸베-트러시아의 第2次5個年計劃의 熟成等等의危機를말하는 것으로 齊藤前內閣은 以上의 非常時을 克服하기 爲한 所謂 非常時 內閣이엿든 거이다. 때문에 萬一 非常時가 解消되엿다면 薺藤內閣의 存在性도 解消되엿을것도 事實이다. 그러나 今次齊藤 內閣의瓦解는 그것이 非常時가解消됨에 因함이아니고 순전히 綱紀問題에 因한것이며 지금이情勢은 아직도 非常時 內閣을要求하야 마지안는터이다.  齊藤內閣의 海相이든 岡田氏는 實로 副總理格으로 心腹의 役割을다하는中 現 後停年 軍豫算案 감소等理由로 辭職하며 當時朝野의政界는 岡田海相의 辭職은그것이 곳 齊藤內閣의 瓦解라고 까지 하엿스며 一部 政客間에서도 次期內閣의引受條件付로 辭職였다고하드니 果然 事實이엿든지? 何如튼 齊藤氏丸에 齊藤氏가司令長官이라면 岡田氏가 叅謀長이엿든 것은 사실이다. 이럿튼 岡田氏가 齊藤內閣의 四寸內閣에 首班된것이 何等異常한 것이업스며 더구나 1935,6年의危機를앞두고 海軍大將인그가 總理大臣된것은 妥當타고봄이 可할것이다. 大藏省疑獄事件의 綱紀問題가 俎上에올나서 비록 非常時內閣일지라도 別數업시 辭職하여야 될 形便에 이르자 齊藤首相은 後繼內閣의首班에對하야 愼重考慮한結果 시국의重大性에  鑑하야 海軍이長老는 氏自身이 信任하는 岡田氏을 웅立코저 後藤 農相을 招致하야 岡田氏을 援助하야 後繼 內閣의 組織에 叅謀하여 달나고相談한一方 原田男을通하야 西園寺公에게도 意思을 疏通하고 다시 高橋山本兩老에게도 岡田氏를 極力推薦하야 大命再降下說 宇垣平沼 山本說等各種의 暗躍明動이 錯雜하는즈음 元老重臣의意에副하야 組閣의大命이 岡田氏에게 降下된 것이다. 當時 多數黨인 政友會은 卽時 今後內閣은<38> 政黨內閣이여야한다고 주장하야 政權을 獲得코저하엿스나 그러나 齊藤內閣이 瓦消됨으로서 非常時가 解消된 것이 아님으로 第二非常時 內閣의 出現은 事實上當然한 것으로 萬一非常時가解消되엿다면 非常時 內閣도 自然히 解消되엿슬 것이다. 때문에 政友會가 政黨政治의常道로서政權을掌握코저 할진대 무엇보담도 非常時의 解消에努力하여야 할 것이다. 政友會와反對로 民政黨은 率先하야 卽時 援助할 意思을 表示하엿스나(듯건대重臣會議時에도 누구보다.若槻男이몬저 岡田氏를 贊求하엿다고한다.) 陸軍側 에서는 拓務省을 廢止하라! 荒木大將을 大臣으로 入閣식히라고 하면서 若干의 反對를 表明하엿을 뿐아니라 海軍測에서도 岡田氏를所謂 倫敦條約軟弱論派라고하야 亦是 反對하야 多數黨인 政友會와 陸軍及海軍一部의반대가잇음으로 岡田內閣이 第2流産內閣이나 아니되는가하야 자못 世人의耳目을集하든中 政友會의床次氏의入閣交涉에 奏效하야 多幸히 流産은 되지아넛으나 難産中의難産으로 지난五日 所謂 第二 岡田非常時內閣이 成立되엿섯다. 그런데 이 難産中에서 組織된 岡田內閣이 日本의政界에 엇더한 波紋을 일으켯는가? 나는 非常時의 克服이란 期必코 陸海軍人의손에 依하야 수행하여야한다는理論은 論理的으로나 常識的으로 成立되지 못한다고 思唯한다. 議會政治制度인日本의政治組織에잇서서 政黨이 嚴然히 存在하고 잇슴에도不拘하고 두 번재나 軍人首班의超然內閣을 보게된 것은 비록 非常時란 特殊 事情에 基因됨이라고 할지라도 政黨存在의無視가 넘우도 그極에 達하엿다고 아니할수 업다. 오날의 政情으로는 아모리 多數한 代議員을 抱有한 政黨일지라도 黨員을 入閣식히기 爲하야서는 그 主張을 굽혀야 되게 되여슨즉 實로 田海의感이업지아니하다. 그러나 事實에잇서서 現下의政黨이란 政友民政을 莫論하고 綱紀問題에 關係치 않은 적이 업다. 더구나 純全히 政黨出身의大臣들은 陸海軍의 實情에 어두우며 國家에 忠直함보다 그들은 自黨의 勢力擴張에 熱中하기 때문에 그런듯도 하나<39> 政黨政治 時代에 政黨內閣을 보지못함을 엇더케 生覺하면 政黨政治가 軍人 政治에로!轉換되는 證據라고 할 수잇다. 非常時라면 唯獨 日本만이 아니라 世界列强이 共通하게 非常時에 處在하엿스며 이 非常時의 壽命이 언제까지 延長될는지? 何如튼 長期的일 것만은 事實일 것갓다. 그런즉 이 長期的인 非常時에잇서서 政黨이란 存在는實업시 허수아비的 存在가아니고 무엇인가. 今日의 政友나 民政이 2,3名의 閣員을 入閣식히는 그것도 將來에는 問題가아닐가? 拓務도 文敎도 財政도모다 軍人이 掌握하여야될 時機라면 더구나 그때의 政黨란 무엇에 所用되는가. 그 다음은 次官이나 政務官쯤 就任식히는 것으로 滿足할는지? 何如튼 岡田 第二非常時內閣의 成立으로 議會政治란 危機에逢着되엿다고 볼 수 잇으며 同時에 政黨의存在란  無意味하게된다고 나는 斷言하고십다. 그리고 多數黨이든 政友會가 事實上 破裂의 危機에 直面하게 되엿스니 이 또한 岡田內閣의 선물이라고 하지안을 수 업다. 비록 形式上으로는 政友會로서 床次山崎內田三氏가 入閣하엿다 할지라도 實質에 잇어서는 薩已派一系에 끈친것으로 政友會의 最高幹部가 그들의入閣에反對하야 除名處分을 斷行함을 보아도 可히알것으로 政友會의 對 岡田內閣態度은 다음과 갗이 聲明되엿다고한다.
「新內閣도 擧國一致의 假面을쓰고잇으나 그實은 政民을 基礎로하는 政黨을 無視하고 政黨을 走狗로 만들여고하는 官僚主義의 發露이다. 此는 組閣의 經過를 보드래도明白하다. 卽民意을基礎로하지안는 舊式官僚 內閣의 復興이다. 國民은 그 때문에 官僚弊害의苦痛을받을 것은 明若觀火한일이다. 特히 何等의 政策이업시 閣員이倚子을늘닌다는 好餌로서 政黨을낙그러한 것은 大浦事件과 往時官僚 時代에 屢次나타난 醜惡 政治의 方式으로 實로 唾棄할 政策의再興이요 國民의 無視이다. 그럼으로 非常時를 부담할 資格이업스며 我黨이 黨議로서 閣僚을入閣식히지않키로  決定한 主旨도 其實은 여기에 잇다. 我黨은 天下에 聲明한바와갗이 國家本位定策本位의 根本方針에 依하야 獨自 이 見地에서 國運進展에 貢獻하며 政府가行하느바를 監視할것이다.」以上 이 聲明을 通하야 政友會가 岡田內閣에 대한 態度를 엇더케갓겟느냐는 임이證明된 것으로 岡田大將이 組閣受命直後「政策이 아직은업다.」는데 對하여서나 床次一流의入閣問題을中心으로 直接 反對의 旗幟를 들고잇으며同時에우리는 大政友會의破裂이 目前에急迫하엿다고보는바이다. 내가 生覺하기는 岡田大將이 何等의 政策이 없다고한 것은 閣僚들의意思에  諮問한 後에 發表하는데 그眞意가 잇고實은 임의齊藤 前首相과의間에 政策에대한討議가 充分히 잇엇슬것으로 林陸相 大角海相 廣田外相은 留任閣僚이며 藤井藏相도 또한 第二世 高橋라고 하리만큼 반드시 高橋前藏相의 政策을 踏襲 할것이며 岡田內閣이 政策의 第一步을 大角 林 藤井 廣田等五相會議를 中心으로 重要 政策을 協議한다고 한즉 網紀肅情 一方主義外에는 齊藤內閣이 政策을<40> 그대로 踏襲 할 것이며 留任閣員인 後  藤內相 亦是 山本前內相의 政策을 그대로 遵行할것인 卽 岡田內閣에 대하야 特別한企待를가질수는업스며 重要政策을 討議함에 前記五名의 超政黨閣僚를 中心으로 한다는 것이 岡田內閣이特異性이라면 特異性일것인대 同時에 政黨出身 閣僚인 床次 町田 松田 內田등도 畢竟은 前記五相會議에 逐收될것이 事實이다. 最後로  岡田內閣이 長命 內閣일가? 短命內閣일가? 나는特別한 政變이없는限 岡田內閣은 長命內閣이라고 斷言하고십다. 多數黨인政友會와陸軍側의一部反對가잇다고하드래도 元老重臣의意에 副하야 1935,6年度 이危機을  岡田內閣에 依하야 克服하려고할 것이며 問題의 危機에 대하야는 明言을 躊躕치 않을수없다. 何如튼 日本의政情이 現內閣으로하여금 1935,6年의危機에 當케할 것 만은 事實일 것 같으며 政友會와의 正面衝突은 時間問題로서 來議會의 解散은 必至의 情勢로 되엿는데 昭和11年度의 海軍會議 改訂期에 當하야 對外國策으로서 가장重要한 것으로 보고 딸하서 同年豫算은 가장 重要視됨으로 今秋適當한機會에 臨時議會를 召集하야 解散을하고 衆議院에잇서서의 政黨의分野를 明白히한後 現內閣의 最大使命을다하는同時 昭和10年의 華盛頓會議에 對處하야 眞正한擧國一致內閣이되도록 또는 보다더한 强力內閣의出現의 機會를 짓기爲하야 衆議院의 解散을 決意하고잇음은 事實로서 政局은 庶幾乎安定일고. 7月12日<41>
