Ch'unwŏn's Three-*Kan* Thatched House

Ch'unwŏn (春園) Yi Kwangsu (李光洙) has resigned from the strenuous duties of the newspaper company and is spending his time befriending idle clouds and wild cranes (閑雲野鶴). We hear that he plans to build a three-*kan* thatched house (草家三間) in the vicinity of Segeomjeong (洗釰停) outside the city to spend this summer escaping the heat. It is likely he will stay there with his wife and children until autumn.<191>

Record of Heavy Drinkers

In his prime days, Yŏm Sangsŏp (廉想涉) was capable of one *sŭng* (一升); Ansŏ (岸曙) was capable of half a dozen beers (麥酒半打); Wŏlt'an (月灘), Yi Hayun (異河潤), Ch'unhae (春海), Kim Chinsŏp (金晋爕), Hoewŏl (懷月) Sim Hun (沈熏), Yi Kiyŏng (李基永), and P'albong (八峯) were all capable of around one *sŭng* (一升內外).
Generally, they are heavy drinkers (酒豪也)!<192>

**Summary**

This short article consists of two brief notes about prominent Korean literary figures in 1934. The first reports that Yi Kwangsu (pen name Ch'unwŏn) has left his newspaper job and is building a small thatched house near Segeomjeong to spend the summer and autumn with his family. The second lists the drinking capacities of several well-known writers, including Yŏm Sangsŏp, Ansŏ, Wŏlt'an, Yi Hayun, Ch'unhae, Kim Chinsŏp, Sim Hun, Yi Kiyŏng, and P'albong, noting their prowess as drinkers. From a historical perspective, the article offers intimate glimpses into the personal lives, leisure activities, and social circles of major Korean intellectuals during the Japanese colonial period. It humanizes these figures beyond their literary works and political contexts, showing aspects of their daily existence and social habits.
