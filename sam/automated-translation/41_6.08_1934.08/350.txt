文壇歸去來
						草兵丁

It has been twenty years since the great master Yi In-jik (李人稙), having drafted *Hyŏllu* (Blood and Tears / 血淚) and *Kwiŭi Sŏng* (Voice of the Demon / 鬼의 聲) with the patriot Kim Ok-kyun (金玉均) as his subject, passed away, yet there is not even a single memorial stone by the roadside. Does the weary spirit of the pioneer wander homeless under the vacant sky for 20 years? The feeling of heartbreak is not insignificant.

It has been 17 or 18 years since Ch'unwŏn released *Mujŏng* (The Heartless / 無情); when 20 years have passed, a grand "Mujŏng 20th Anniversary Festival" should be held. If Ch'unwŏn hadn't been there then, if *Mujŏng* hadn't been there then, would so many writers and works have emerged afterward? Even a hundred candles begin with the lighting of the very first single candle. Ch'unwŏn and Kukch'o were that very first candle, a precious single light.

The Chungang Ilbo features T'aejun then Sim Hun, T'aejun then Sim Hun, repeating the same writers in a relay style. The Tong-a Ilbo features Yun Paek-nam, then Yun Paek-nam again for the third and fourth time, repeating one writer. What should readers think of this?

If only all those writers of yesteryear—Sosŏng's Hyŏn Sang-yun, Sunşŏng's Chin Hak-mun, Soo's Sŏl Ŭi-sik, Hamong's Yi Sang-hyŏp, Ch'ŏlligu's Kim Tong-sŏng—would make a comeback.

In Tokyo, the cry of "Literary Renaissance" (文藝復興) is loud. In the old days, within 48 hours of this cry, its usual direct translation style and carelessly absurd critical essays would have already been directly imported into Chosŏn,<150> but this time it is quiet. It is truly pleasant quietness. That just a few—some three self-important, balloon-like critics who spout off as they please—have kept their mouths shut has made things this orderly and dignified. Though late, it is an awakening; may it stay this way, stay this way.

Novelist Nangun, poets Namgung Pyŏk, Yi Chang-hŭi came into the world but could not eat well, and left the world without even possessing a single gravestone. Even death row inmates or travelers who die on the road have their own graves and wooden markers, but O society ignorant of literature, may you be cursed for a hundred generations!

It has been 7 or 8 years since Sŏhae and Tokkyŏn emerged; since then, one can count only about three writers of weight, such as Chang Hyŏk-chu and Pak Hwa-sŏng. Geniuses may appear once in a thousand years, once in a hundred years, but could it be that there are truly no geniuses like this? Is it possible there are none?

Yun Ch'i-ho, Kim Ch'ang-je, Pak Sŭng-bin, and others oppose the "Han'gŭl" already organized and established. The reason lies in it being difficult and complex.

It is true that the new spelling system has the fault of adding 500 new characters through printing and drastically increasing the complex consonant clusters (四付五添한 밧침자 - sabuoch'ŏmhan patch'imja), thus harming the "beauty of characters" and simplicity. However, if the authority decided upon after such difficult debate is undermined, we will fall again into a state of anarchy. For the sake of maintaining public order, would it not be better to support the side of the Language Society (語學會) members like Yi Kŭng-no and Yi Yun-jae?

Chang Hyŏk-chu's "A Man Called Kwon" (權と云ふ男) is a praiseworthy masterpiece. However, it is limited by not being written in Korean script (언문 - ŏnmun). If it were, would even one-tenth of it survive? Would even one-hundredth of it survive?<151>

**Summary**

Writing under the pen name Ch'obyŏngjŏng, the author offers a series of critical observations on the Korean literary scene in 1934. The piece laments the lack of recognition for past pioneers like Yi In-jik, celebrates Yi Kwang-su (Ch'unwŏn) as a foundational figure, criticizes newspapers for repetitive author choices, calls for the return of older writers, expresses relief that Korea isn't blindly following a supposed "Literary Renaissance" trend from Tokyo, bemoans the poverty and lack of memorials for deceased writers, notes a perceived scarcity of new "genius" writers after Ch'oe Sŏ-hae and Na To-hyang, and discusses the ongoing debate about the new unified Hangul orthography, ultimately siding with the Korean Language Society's proponents for the sake of order despite acknowledging the new system's flaws. The author also praises Chang Hyŏk-chu's Japanese-language novel but regrets it wasn't written in Korean. From a historical perspective, the article reveals anxieties about the development and independence of Korean literature under colonial rule, the practical challenges faced by writers (poverty, lack of recognition), the internal debates surrounding language standardization (Hangul orthography), and the complex reality of Korean writers working in Japanese. The commentary on the "Literary Renaissance" in Tokyo and the relief at Korea's lack of imitation is particularly interesting, suggesting a growing desire for cultural autonomy.

						草兵丁
巨匠 李人稙, 愛國者 金玉均을 題材로, 血淚, 鬼의 聲을 草하고 죽은지 二十年, 路傍에 碑石一基 조차 업다, 고달푼 先驅者의 靈, 無主空天에서 20年을 路宿하엿는가 함애 斷腸之感 不無.

春園 「無情」을 낸지 17,8年, 20年만 되면 「無情二十年祭」를 盛大히 擧行할 일. 그때 春園 업섯던들, 그때 無情 업섯던들, 그 뒤 作家 作品이 그러케 만히 나와슬는고, 백 자루의 촛불도 맨 처음엔 단 한 자루의 초불 켜짐에서부터 시작된다. 春園, 菊初는 그 맨 첫 자루의 촛불, 貴重한 一燈.

中央日報 泰俊
沈熏, 泰俊 沈熏으로 리-레식으로 同一作家 飜復. 東亞日報 尹白南, 尹白南으로 三次 四次 한 作家 飜復, 讀者로서는 엇더케 생각할 일인고.

小星의 玄相允, 瞬星의 秦學文, 小梧의 薛義植, 何夢의 李相協, 千里駒의 金東成, 옛날의 이 모든, 作家 다시 再起하여 주엇스면.

東京서는 「文藝復興」소리 高. 옛날 가트면 이 소리 잇슨지 48時間 以內에 朝鮮에 벌서 그例의 直譯口調요. 疏雜荒唐한 評文이 直輸入되엇스련만<150> 이번은 잠잠하다. 참으로 愉快한 잠잠이다. 겨우 몃 사람의, 혼자 제멋대로 직거리는 고무風船的 評家 數 三人이 입을 담을어 주니 이러틋 秩序잇고 鄭重味 잇서지는 것을 그대로 晩覺도 覺이니 이 모양대로 이 모양대로.

小說家, 浪雲, 詩人 南宮壁, 李章熙, 世에 來하야 美食을 못하엿고 世에 去하야 墓碑 一基 조차 못가젓다. 死刑囚나 行旅 死亡人에게도 제 무덤 제 木碑 잇건만 文藝를 모르는 社會여 百代를 呪咀 밧어라.

曙海, 獨鵑, 나온 지 7,8年, 그뒤 무게잇는 作家로 張赫宙, 朴花城 等. 數 3人를 數할뿐, 天才야 千年에 한 사람 百年에 한 사람 잇슬 法이로되 天才야 이러케도 업든가, 업슬손가 .

尹致昊, 金昶濟, 朴勝彬 等 이미 整理하여논 「한글」에 반대. 理由는 難澁, 複雜하다 함에 在.

印刷하여 五百字의 新綴字 增하고 四付五添한 밧침자 激增하고 그래서 「文字의 美」와 單純性을 傷한 嫌은 新綴字法에 確實히 有하나 그러나 그러타고 겨우 論難之餘에 決定된 그 權威를 헌다년 또 無政府狀態에 陷, 차라리 李克魯, 李允宰 等 語學會 편을 支持함이 治安維持上 不亦可乎아.

張赫宙의 「權と云ふ男」 자랑할 名作 但 언문으로 못 됨이 限이나 그러자면 十分一이나 사라 나올가, 百分一이나 사라나올가?<151>
<150-151>
