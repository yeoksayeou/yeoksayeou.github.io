Account of Meeting Tosan After Twenty-Five Years
						Kim Sŏngŏp

It was 11:40 PM on June 18th. I boarded the southbound train from P'yŏngyang, bound for Taejŏn. My purpose was to meet Tosan, whom I had been longing to see for over a year. It wasn't for any significant business, but merely to know how thin he had become, how he was battling loneliness, what clothes he was wearing, how much his beard had grown, and how many more wrinkles had appeared on his forehead. Yet, various complex emotions raced through my heart as I went to seek him out.

Looking back, it feels like a distant past – perhaps 25 or 26 years ago. When I wore a middle school uniform and attended Taesŏng School in P'yŏngyang, I often met Tosan. Having him, renowned throughout the era as a youth educator and man of passion, as our principal, the image of Tosan was deeply imprinted in the minds of us who were receiving a Spartan-style education emphasizing Wisdom, Virtue, and Body (智德體). The magnificent sight when a troop of robust youths from the Western Province (西道健兒), forming ranks, marched in a single file over the snow-covered ice sheet of the Taedong River amid the harsh (치윤) three winter months when the north wind blew and cold snow flew – even we ourselves thought it was a magnificent spectacle. Tosan would stand erect in the schoolyard, <97> always watching the students marching with deep emotion. And when the students returned, he would have them stand in the schoolyard and give encouraging speeches, saying,
“Become steel!”
“Become iron pillars!”

At that time, Tosan was also a young man in his early 30s, full of vigor. How old would he look if I met him now?
Would his black hair have turned white? Is that booming voice, which used to move others so well, still resonant and clear?
All these thoughts ceaselessly ran up and down in my chest.

While excited like this on the night train, I had one worry. That was, although I was going to Taejŏn, could I actually meet him once I arrived? Would they even allow me, having come from afar, to have a meeting? Thinking this, anxiety pierced my heart.

Tossing and turning, unable to sleep, I got off the train in Kyŏngsŏng at 9:00 AM the next day, the 19th. After briefly attending to business at the newspaper company, I immediately changed trains that same day and departed for Taejŏn at 9:40 PM, arriving at my destination <98> in Taejŏn, Ch'ungnam, at 1:00 AM on the 20th.

After arriving in Taejŏn, I spent a night at an inn and waited eagerly for dawn. At 9:30 AM, I visited the red-brick Taejŏn Prison located in a pine grove on the outskirts, stated the purpose of my visit, and requested a meeting. Thanks to the kindness of Director Miyazaki, I was able to meet Tosan at 10:30 AM that day in the prison meeting room, attended by a guard.

Meeting my old Principal An after 25 years!
For a moment, I felt as if an electric current flowed through my body, stunned (然함). Tosan also looked at my face and remained silent. It seemed difficult for him to immediately recognize the face he had seen in childhood. After a moment, appearing to recognize me, he showed a happy expression (깃분빗) and said,
“You must be middle-aged (中老) now.”
This was his first greeting.

I, too, was surprised at how much Tosan had aged, but I felt an indescribable joy that his gentle yet weighty voice remained unchanged from the old days. Thus,
After talking about strictly limited world affairs and health matters for about twenty minutes, we even shook hands. Tosan, again wearing the prisoner's screen (용우쓰고) and accompanied by the guard, went back into the prison cell, and I came out calmly.

Regarding his health, his indigestion symptoms have recently subsided considerably. The dental problems (齒牙) that caused him much suffering (幸苦) have been alleviated as the dentures (入齒) he got again in Taejŏn are relatively perfect (比較的 完全), allowing him to chew food well. His spirit, which never knows despair, remains strong even inside the prison cell, where he practices Western-style physical fitness exercises (西式强健術), paying close attention to his health.

The work he does daily now is sewing (裁縫) – mending clothes with a needle (바눌) – which he says feels very good for his state of mind (氣分上).
As I left, he asked me two or three times consecutively to convey his regards (問安) to all his friends and acquaintances.

Sincerely wishing for the health (心祝) of Tosan, who still has 1 or 2 years left in his sentence (刑期), I left Taejŏn on the evening train (夕陽車) that day.
Even from the train, I looked back again and again (再三, 再四) at the prison building (建物) nestled in the distant pine grove.<99>

**Summary**

Kim Sŏngŏp recounts his emotional reunion with his former school principal, An Ch'angho (pen name Tosan), after 25 years. Kim travels from P'yŏngyang to Taejŏn Prison in June 1934 specifically to see Tosan, recalling vivid memories of Tosan's passionate leadership at Taesŏng School. Despite the strict prison setting and Tosan's aged appearance, Kim finds his former teacher's gentle voice unchanged and his spirit undimmed. Tosan maintains his health through exercise, works contentedly at sewing, and sends regards to acquaintances outside. The article provides a poignant glimpse into the imprisoned life of a major Korean independence figure. For historians, this personal account offers valuable insights into An Ch'angho's condition, morale, and daily routine during his imprisonment in Taejŏn under Japanese rule, humanizing a historical figure often seen only through his political activities. The mention of the prison director's "kindness" and the details of prison life (sewing work, limited conversation topics) are also noteworthy.

二十五年만에 島山會見記
						金性業
때는 지난 6月 18日 下午 11時 40分이다. 平壤서 南行列車에 몸을 실고 大田行을 하기로되엿다. 目的은 일년 남아를 두고 하도 벼르든 島山을 面會하려 함이라. 무슨 큰 用務를 지닌 것이 아니고 다만 얼마나 여위엇는가 얼마나 寂寞과 싸우고 잇는가 무슨 옷을 입고 수염은 얼마나 자랏스며 이마에는 주름쌀이 몃가달이나 더 끼엇는가 그것을 알려함에 불과하지만은 차저가는 내 가슴속에는 여러 가지로 復雜한 感懷가 줄다름질을 첫다.
回顧하면 벌서 먼-녯날 그것이 25, 6年이나 될가 내가 中學生制服을 입고 平壤大成學校를 다닐 때에 나는 늘 島山을 맛낫다. 靑年敎育家요 情熱家로써 一世에 그 일이 널니 알니어진 그 분을 校長으로 마저가지고 智德體의 스팔타式 敎育을 밧고 잇든 우리 머리에는 島山의 그림자는 크게 깁게 머리속에 印 찍키엿다. 朔風寒雪이 날니는 치윤 三冬 大同江의 積雪진 永판우를 西道健兒의 一隊가 隊伍를 整齊하여一路行進할 때의 壯觀은 우리 스스로 생각하기에도 壯觀이엇다. 島山은 學生들 行進하는 光景을 校庭에 直立하여<97> 恒常 感激으로 보고 잇섯다. 그리고 도라온 學徒들을 校庭에 세워 노코는
「강철이 되어라」
「무쇠기둥이 되어라」
하고 激勵하는 演說을 하여 주엇다.
그 때는 島山도 30年 前后의 血氣에 찬 靑年이엇다. 그분이 지금 맛나 본다면 얼마나 늙엇슬가.
검는 머리칼도 히여지엿슬가. 그 우렁차고 남을 잘 울니든 목소리도 지금도 청청한가 맑은가.
이 모든 생각이 거칠사이 업시 가슴 上下를 오르나린다.

이러케 夜行車中에서 興奮 하면서도 한가지 근심이 잇섯다. 그것은 大田을 가기는 가지만은 大田가면 果然 面會할 수 잇슬가. 遠來의 나를 面會나 식혀줄가. 이런 생각을 하면 不安한 생각이 가슴을 찌른다.
이럭저럭 轉輾不寐타가 翌19日 午前 9時에 京城서 下車하야 新聞社의 일을 잠간 보고 그날곳車를 박궈타고서  午后 9時 40分에 大田行을 하여 20日 午前 1시에 目的地인<98>忠南大田에 내리엇다.
大田 나려서는 一夜를 旅舍에서 지내고 날새기를 고대하여 午前 九時半에 郊外 솔밧속에잇는 붉은벽돌집 大田刑務所로 訪問하여 온 뜻을 告하고 面會를 請한 즉 宮崎所長의 好意로 그 날 午前 열시반에 看守가선 刑務所面會室에서 島山을 相對케 되엇다.
25年만에 맛나는 녯날의 安校長!
내 몸에는 電流가 흘으듯 一瞬은 然함을 늣겻다. 島山도 내 얼골을 보고 沈黙한다. 어릴 때에 본 얼골을 얼는 記憶하기 어려워함인 듯 한참잇다가 아러본 듯 깃분빗을 띄며
「君이 인제 中老가 되엇스려」
이것이 첫인사의 말이다.
나 亦 島山이 만히 늙은데 놀낫스나 그 부드럽고 무거운 목소리는 예나 지금이나 變함 업는데 무어라 말할 수 업는 愉悅을 늣기어진다. 이라하야
極히 制限된 世上일 이약이와 健康 이약이를 約 二十分間하고 난 후 握手까지 하고 島山은 다시 용우쓰고 看守에 同行되어 監房으로 드러가는 것올 보고 초연히 나오다.
그분의 健康은 요지음 消化不良症도 만히 減退가 되엇다. 齒牙로만히 幸苦하든 것도 大田서 다시 入齒한 것이 比較的 完全하여 飮食을 咀嚼하는 것도 잘 된다하며 언제든지 失望할줄 모르는 그 意氣는 監房안에서도 西式强健術을 實施하야 健康에 몹시 留意하고 잇섯다.
只今 每日 하는 일은 바눌을 쥐고 옷을 꾀여매는 裁縫의 일인데 氣分上으로도 매우 조타고 한다.
나을 때에 一般親知에게 問安하여 달나고 두세번 連하여 말하엿다.
아직 刑期가 1, 2年 남은 島山의 健康을 心祝하며 나는 그 날 夕陽車로 大田을 떠낫다.
車中에서도 저 멀니 솔밧속에 안즌 刑務所 建物을 再三, 再四 처다보앗다<99>
<97-99>
