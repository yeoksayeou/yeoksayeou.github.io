**Summary**

This article from the August 1934 issue of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine consists of three short news items presented as a "Life Bulletin Board." The first lists attendance figures for recent lectures and performances by prominent figures like Yŏ Unhyŏng and Yun Kŭgyŏng, framing audience size as a measure of popularity. The second announces upcoming book publications by well-known authors such as Yi Kwangsu, Kim Tongin, and Pak Yŏnghŭi. The third categorizes notable female writers by their marital status: 'Miss' (unmarried), 'Madame/Mrs.' (married/widowed), and those who have 'reverted to Miss' (likely through divorce), including figures like Na Hyesŏk and Kim Illyŏp. For historians, this piece offers a snapshot of cultural life and social conventions in colonial Korea, highlighting public interest in intellectual and artistic figures, the literary output of the time, and particularly the societal tendency to classify prominent women based on their marital status, including the explicit mention of those whose status changed presumably due to divorce or separation, reflecting the changing social dynamics and visibility of women in the public sphere.
