In a mountain valley in Gangwon-do Province (江原道), there lived a *yangban* (兩班) named Mr. Pak (朴氏), who had one daughter.

In the same village lived Mr. Yi (李氏), who also had one son.

Mr. Pak's daughter was one year old this year; Mr. Yi's son was two years old this year.

One day, from the Yi household came a marriage proposal (청혼), saying, "We old folks don't know when we'll die, so let's get those little ones married (결혼식히자)."

The *yangban* Mr. Pak became angry (怒하여), chased them away (차보낸뒤), and then said to his wife (마누라더러),

"Well, did you ever hear of such an outrageous thing (이런변)? My daughter is one year old, and that fellow's (그녀석) son is two years old – exactly () double her age (고비란말이우)! So, when my daughter turns ten years old (염살먹힐), that brat will be twenty (스무살). How can a ten-year-old and a twenty-year-old possibly be the right age (나히 마저야) to marry?"

"Oh dear (에그), husband (영감두), you should have agreed! My daughter is one year old this year (금년), but next year (명년이면) she'll be two, won't she? At that time, she'll be exactly the same age as that boy. Being the same age again (재동갑), wouldn't that be just perfect (오직조와서)?"

"...Hmmph, hmmph. Is that so (그러쿠만)?" <39>

**Summary**

This short, humorous anecdote from 1934 tells of a *yangban*, Mr. Pak, who rejects a marriage proposal for his one-year-old daughter from Mr. Yi, whose son is two. Mr. Pak objects because the boy is double his daughter's age, meaning when she is ten, he will be twenty. His wife cleverly refutes this by pointing out that next year, the daughter will be two, just like the son will be (in her logic, ignoring he also ages), making them "the same age again" (재동갑) and thus suitable for marriage. For historians, this piece reflects social customs like early marriage arrangements and class consciousness (*yangban*) in rural Korea during the colonial period. It also showcases contemporary humor based on flawed logic and wordplay, while the archaic orthography provides valuable linguistic data from the 1930s.
