Editorial Notice
						Samch'ŏlli Editorial Bureau

We had intended for the study on India's Gandhi (印度 간듸), which Mr. Cho Man-sik (曺晩植氏) was writing, to continue from the previous issue and enter the main discussion in this issue; however, due to circumstances, it has been interrupted. We ask for the deep understanding (甚諒) of our readers. <130>

**Summary**

This is a brief editorial notice from the *Samch'ŏlli* magazine's editorial team. They apologize to readers because a planned continuation of a study on India's Gandhi by Cho Man-sik could not be published in this issue due to unspecified "circumstances." This highlights potential editorial difficulties or external pressures faced by Korean publications during the colonial period. For historians, it is interesting as it points to the possible sensitivities surrounding discussions of figures like Gandhi, a prominent anti-colonial leader, and hints at the constraints under which Korean intellectuals and publishers operated.
