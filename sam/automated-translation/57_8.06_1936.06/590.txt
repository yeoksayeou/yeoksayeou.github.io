Even When Crying, I'm Sad
						Yun Kŭg'yŏng

Your face is sad
Your eyes are sad
Your words are sad
This and that are sad
My love is sorrowful
I weep, but even weeping, I'm sad

Seeing the mountains is sad
Seeing the water is sad
Flowers and birds are sad too
Everything, everything is sad
My love is sorrowful
I weep, but even weeping, I'm sad<286>

**Summary**

This short poem by Yun Kŭg'yŏng expresses a deep and pervasive sense of sorrow ("설움"). The speaker finds sadness in everything associated with their beloved ("님") – their face, eyes, and words – and also projects this sorrow onto the natural world, finding mountains, water, flowers, and birds equally sad. The core emotion is the speaker's own sorrowful love, which leads to weeping that brings no relief. From a historical perspective, the poem, published in 1936 during the Japanese colonial period, could reflect the pervasive sense of national sorrow (han) and helplessness felt by many Koreans under occupation, even if expressed through the lens of personal love and loss. Historians might find it illustrative of the emotional landscape and suppressed feelings prevalent during that era.
