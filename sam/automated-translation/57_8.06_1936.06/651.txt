**Summary**

This article is a formal announcement (社告) from the Samch'ŏlli Company declaring the establishment of its West Korea General Branch Office (西鮮總支社) in P'yŏngyang, effective May 3rd, 1936. The new branch covers P'yŏngan Namdo and Hwanghae-do and will handle all business affairs in the region. The announcement lists the key personnel of the new branch office and provides instructions for existing and prospective local branch offices regarding registration deadlines, procedures, and monthly subscription fee payments.

This announcement is interesting for colonial Korean history as it demonstrates the business expansion and organizational structure of a major private Korean cultural enterprise, Samch'ŏlli magazine, during the Japanese colonial period. It provides concrete details about its regional operations (specifically targeting northwestern Korea from P'yŏngyang), lists the names of Koreans involved in media management and journalism at the time, and reflects the administrative and communication methods used (like postal transfers and the use of Japanese era names). The mention of specific locations and the structure itself sheds light on the media landscape and business practices in 1930s Korea.
