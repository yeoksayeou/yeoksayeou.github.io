Critique of Bank Leaders: Mr. Mun Sang-u of Haedong Bank
						By Kang Ch'on Kŏsa

Proceeding about ten *kan* from Chongno 4-ka toward Namdaemun, just before Kwanggyo, there is a two-story Western-style building on the right. The upper floor is currently occupied by Kyŏngsŏng Spinning, and the lower floor comprises the entire domain of Haedong Bank. Regarding the history of Haedong Bank, those who know, know. In terms of numerous upheavals and changes in leadership, it is likely unparalleled not only in the Korean banking world of Kyŏngsŏng but in the entire history of banking in Chosŏn. From its founding, a stock consumption incident made even its emergence questionable to the world. Not long after its establishment, it experienced unique turmoil due to position disputes and other issues. Then, Mr. Cho Sŏl-hyŏn (曺偰鉉) took it over and reigned as Managing Director (專務), leading it into a state of relative stability. However, when he again reached the brink of financial ruin, it once more couldn't find a master, becoming like a wandering child in the streets. "Who will save Haedong?" became the focus of public attention. Somehow, the Kim Sŏng-su (金性洙) chaebol came to take charge of the said bank. Consequently, Haedong Bank, which had been struggling through groans and hardships, finally established its foundation in the Korean financial world. Since coming under the iron-clad fortress of the Kim Sŏng-su chaebol, it has reformed various internal and external systems, executing its business entirely based on the principle of solidity first. It firmly promised shareholders that it would proceed without dividends until the bank's internal substance became solid, planning to increase its reserve funds. While taking over the bank and reforming its substance and other aspects, Mr. Kim Sŏng-su propelled his younger brother, Mr. Kim Yŏn-su (金秊洙), to the position of Managing Director (仝銀專務) of the bank. Furthermore, he recruited Mr. Mun Sang-u (文尙宇) from Kyŏngsangnam-do, whose character was similar to his own, to manage the affairs as Manager (支配人).<72> Thus, although the bank welcomed and bid farewell to numerous new masters, none succeeded like the Kim faction because they primarily lacked backing. Like a lone boat in rough waves, it lost its compass in the ever-changing tides of the financial world, facing only hidden reefs and sandbars ahead. After gaining the backing of the Kim chaebol, however, numerous supporters surrounded the bank and served as its compass, allowing it to be revived and stand tall. Specifically, by absorbing deposits from the various institutions backed by the Kim Sŏng-su chaebol—Chungang High Common School (中央高普), Tong-A Ilbo (東亞日報), Chungang Commerce and Industry (中央商工), Kyŏngsŏng Spinning (京城紡織), Posŏng College (普成專門), etc.—and also gaining control over lending to related commercial and industrial institutions, this became the bank's resuscitation medicine. This is a brief outline of the bank's history. Now, entering the main topic, the first thing to mention is that this bank's organizational structure differs somewhat from other banks by adopting the Managing Director (Chŏnmu) system. Even if there were a President (頭取), this would be a decorative figurehead occupying a position without duties (尸位素餐), with real power held by the Managing Director. Deciding to eliminate this useless appendage and adopt a Managing Director system that matches name and reality, it has reached the present day. The first Managing Director (limited to after the reform) was Mr. Kim Sŏng-su's beloved younger brother, Kim Yŏn-su (金䄵洙), and the second generation is Mr. Mun Sang-u. (Mr. Kim Yŏn-su is Chairman of the Board of Directors - 取役會長).

Mr. Mun Sang-u, Managing Director of Haedong Bank! He is a native of Tongnae, Kyŏngsangnam-do. Since entering the bank as Manager 6 or 7 years ago, his duties as assistant to Managing Director Kim Yŏn-su were important, but the great contribution and effort he displayed in solidifying the bank's shaky foundation to its present state likely served as the motive for his promotion to the key position of Managing Director and Manager (專務 兼 支配人). He took over management of the bank from Mr. Kim Yŏn-su as Managing Director last autumn.
Regarding Mr. Mun Sang-u, apart from Haedong Bank personnel and a few dozen acquaintances and relatives, few people probably even remember his name; this is the full picture of the man. That is, one can find no presence of him socially, individually, or in terms of reputation. This arises partly from his introverted (內沈的) and non-extroverted (外進的) personality, but also because he always strives for inner substance (內實) and disregards outward appearance (外觀), preventing his name from becoming known outside. To put it plainly, he is not someone who clings only to the demeanor of a conservative village teacher (村새님) and, like contemporary bankers, employs all sorts of schemes and tactics (權謀術數), charging left and right and probing boundaries. He is thoroughly moderate and sincere, unable to push down subordinates to climb up (下石上撑), a solid person of the type commonly called "one who plucks his own hair to plug his own hole." This is directly reflected in his private life as well, where his actions and demeanor<73> are as if cast in a mold (『판』에 박은 듯).
However, Mr. Mun is by no means an inactive or incompetent person. He completed the prescribed school stages in Chosŏn early on, then packed his bags and crossed to Japan (負芨渡東), forsaking everything else to build the qualities needed to leap into the business world. He enrolled at Tōkyō Higher Commercial School (東京高商), diligently studied (螢雪의 功), graduated, returned home in glory (錦衣로 還鄕), and worked at a certain bank in Pusan, treading the same path and accumulating achievements until eventually becoming Manager there. As he was originally indifferent to diplomatic advancement, he continued his consistent principle in dealing with people there too. There was an incident where his conduct deviating from norms in private life caused some controversy (物議) in Pusan society, but regardless, he received recognition from Haedong Bank and attained his current position. Setting this aside, since his tenure as Haedong Bank's Managing Director is short, his skill and capability (手腕, 力量) in this role (which I intend to discuss further later) are unknown variables, making a quick evaluation hesitant. However, judging from his usual conduct and performance as Manager, one can infer his future actions, so I will attempt a brief character assessment.

As mentioned before, regarding Mr. Mun Sang-u, his interactions are limited outside of banking circles, making impressions of him faint, to the point that one might not grasp his daily behavior. However, from what the author has seen, he gives the first impression of having the air of a village scholar (村學者) while also being very sharp and strict. His stern demeanor makes it difficult for anyone to approach him easily. The way he leans back in his chair lacks the air of an audacious millionaire, and the strength in his gaze as he observes people truly makes him seem unapproachable. Not only that, but when conversing with him, the accent of his speech, which seems to cut things off cleanly, is said to reveal his unique personality, according to street talk (巷談). Furthermore, once he dislikes or distrusts something in his heart, he is the type who wouldn't hesitate to shake his head even if thousands or millions insisted otherwise.
Also, his character is such that even if he could save myriad people by plucking out a single strand of hair (헌터럭), he would not gladly consent to plucking that hair. His fierce advance towards his convictions is indeed admirable, but seeking tolerance and forgiveness (包容과 寬恕) from him is truly like seeking fish from a tree (緣木求魚). His sincere attitude of supporting a person once chosen and trusted until that person resigns voluntarily earns everyone's astonished gaze, but it is hard to find any goodwill in him to guide and arrange (指導斡旋) the future prospects of subordinates or supplicants. His attachment to even small sums (分錢) is commendable, and his integrity (志操), allowing no adjustment even for minuscule profits (毫利), is said to be astonishingly<74> thorough. His clear mind (頭腦), proficiency in reason (理智), rigidity (剛直), meticulousness (緻密), inner brightness (內明), and outward compliance (外順) – viewed from any angle – would qualify him first-rate for a managerial or section chief level administrative role in a bank. However, as a figure capable of grasping the larger picture (大局), possessing the ability to manage and embrace people (御人包容), and having the breadth of scope (局量) and magnanimity (襟度) expected of top leadership, one wonders. In short, comparing him to a household, he would be a suitable housewife (主婦) who meticulously manages income and expenses, but perhaps lacks the qualifications of a master (主人) who respects superiors, leads subordinates, and brings glory to the household. He can manage and protect what is entrusted to him without fault, but he is not a person who will creatively forge ahead and accomplish great deeds amidst gains and losses. Broadly speaking, he is a person content with his lot (守分樂道), not one who dreams of great achievements (鴻業大成). Such a person is indeed a disciple of Yan Hui (顔子), who could find joy even while eating coarse food, drinking water, and sleeping with his arm as a pillow (飯素食飮水하고 股肱而寢之라도 樂亦在其中).
However, a word of clarification must be offered here for Mr. Mun: for a bank like Haedong, whose foundation was constantly shaky, he is an indispensable contributor of the highest order. Like sending off guests through the back door while welcoming new ones through the front (後門送朗하고 前門迎賓하듯), Haedong Bank saw frequent changes in leadership and funding shifts, causing headaches not just over unpaid dividends but sometimes even over staff salaries. Even with the backing of the Kim Sŏng-su chaebol, if, during the harsh initial period of reform, someone aiming for worldly fame and glory had appeared instead of a steadfast manager like Mr. Mun, it surely would have led to disaster, like carrying firewood into a fire (負焰入火). Herein lies Mr. Mun's shining presence and his role as a meritorious subject in the revival and reform of Haedong Bank. To illustrate how frugal and thrifty (節用節儉) he is regarding bank funds, I wish to introduce a short anecdote below.

The time was the autumn festival three years ago. A certain association was being held in Kyŏngsŏng with the intention of discussing various issues in finance, economy, commerce, industry, and other industrial sectors, and presenting requests to relevant parties. As part of the preparations, they sought some financial assistance from various banks and several societies. Upon learning this, all other banks voluntarily provided their share (*) of support. However, when the person related to this matter strongly requested (*) some indication of contribution from Mr. Mun Sang-u at Haedong Bank, Mr. Mun deferred to the then-Managing Director Kim Yŏn-su, and Mr. Kim, in turn, deferred back to Mr. Mun. Ultimately, the deadline passed, and the person who had initiated the request was reportedly indignant.
In any case, one must recognize that Mr. Mun's distinctive traits are that he avoids the arrogance, luxury, and indulgence common among ordinary bank leaders (*), possessing instead a character marked by kindness, simplicity, and composure. (End of this section)<75>

**Summary**

This 1936 article profiles Mun Sang-u, the new Managing Director of Haedong Bank in Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul). It first recounts the bank's tumultuous history, marked by scandals and leadership changes, until its stabilization under the ownership of the powerful Kim Sŏng-su chaebol. Mun, previously a manager, is credited with playing a key role in this stabilization alongside Kim's brother, Kim Yŏn-su. The author describes Mun as introverted, meticulous, extremely frugal, and principled, but perhaps lacking the broad vision and interpersonal warmth needed for top leadership. He is seen as an ideal figure for consolidating the bank's shaky finances but not necessarily for ambitious expansion. An anecdote illustrates his extreme thriftiness, contrasting with other banks' practices.

For historians, this article offers insight into the Korean-owned banking sector during the colonial period, highlighting the struggles against instability and the crucial role of capital backing, exemplified by the Kim Sŏng-su group (associated with institutions like Posŏng College and the Tong-A Ilbo). It provides a contemporary assessment of a key figure, Mun Sang-u, portraying the perceived necessary characteristics (frugality, diligence) for managing Korean capital under colonial constraints, contrasting implicitly with more flamboyant or perhaps risk-taking figures. The piece also reveals contemporary perceptions of leadership styles and the internal dynamics within a prominent Korean enterprise.

銀行主腦人物評 海東銀行 文尙宇氏
						江村居士
鍾路四街里에서 南大門을 향하야 十餘間을 前進하면 廣橋 못미처 右便으로 2층 洋屋이 잇다. 그 上層은 京城紡織에서 偶居하고 잇고 그 下層이 海東銀行의 全領域이 되어 잇다. 海東銀行의 由來에 대하야는 아는 사람은 다 알 것이다. 幾多의 波瀾과 主腦者의 變遷이 만키로는 京城朝鮮人 銀行界 뿐아니라 全朝鮮銀行 有史以來에 그 類가 업슬 것이다. 創立初부터 株金消費事件으로 世上에 나올 것까지도 疑問視케 되엇섯스며 또 나온지 未久에 地位 다톰과 其他로 無雙한 波瀾을 격고 끌어다가 曺偰鉉氏가 引受하여 專務로 君臨하자 小康狀態를 가지고 나아오게 되엇스나 다시 氏가 財政的으로 破*의 域에 達하자 또 다시 主人을 찾지 못하야 街頭에 彷徨하는 幼兒와 가치 누가 海東을 살니느냐?가 世人의 注視를 끌게 되더니만 엇찌엇찌하야 金性洙氏 財閥이 仝銀行을 맛게 되엇다. 그래서 呻吟, 艱苦, 에 부댁기든 海東銀行은 비로소 그 地盤을 朝鮮人 金融界에 싸케 되엇스니 저-金城鐵壁 같은 金性洙氏 財閥에 屬한 후로부터는 內外諸制度를 刷新하고 전혀 堅實第一主義로 事務를 執行하게 되며, 株主에게는 어느 때까지든지 同銀의 內容이 充實하기까지는 無配로 나아갈 것을 굿게 言約하며 積立金進增을 圖謀하엿든 것이다. 金性洙氏는 仝銀을 인수하야 내용 기타를 혁식하는 동시에 氏의 令弟 金秊洙氏를 仝銀專務로 扳躍하고 다시 氏의 性格과 近似한 慶南 文尙宇氏를 招聘하야 支配人으로써 事務에<72> 當케 하엿다. 그러면 仝銀에는 幾多의 새 主人을 맛고 보내고 했으나 金氏一派가 끌고 나아가듯이 못한 것은 主로 背景이 업섯든 까닭이다. 激浪 속 孤舟와 가치 變化無雙한 金融界의 波濤에 指針을 일코섯스니 可謂 그 압페는 暗礁와 砂洲가 닥처 왓슬 뿐이다. 그럿튼 것이 金氏財閥을 背景으로 한 後는 幾多의 背景이 仝銀을 휩싸고 指針 노릇을 하게 되니 嚴然히 再生聳立하게 된 것이다. 卽 金性洙氏 財閥을 背景으로 한 幾多의 機關, 中央高普, 東亞日報, 中央商工, 京城紡織, 普成專門 등 各 機關의 預金을 吸收하는 一方 此에 關聯된 商工業 機關에 貸出도 掌握하게 되매 이것이 비로소 仝銀의 起死回生劑가 된 것이다. 이것은 仝銀 由來의 槪略이거니와 이제 本論으로 들어가랴 하는 처음에 먼저 말 할 것은 仝銀은 다른 銀行과 多少 職制가 달러 專務制를 採用한 것이니 設使 頭取가 잇다 한들 此는 尸位素餐의 한 裝飾品이오 實權은 專務가 掌握하엿든 것인데 無用의 長物을 아조 치워버리고 名實相符하게 專務制를 採用하기로 되어 今日에 일은 바이니 第一代 專務는(改革後에 限한 것)金性洙氏의 愛弟 金䄵洙氏오 第二代가 文尙宇氏이다. (金䄵洙氏는 取役會長)

海東銀行 專務의 文尙宇氏! 氏는 慶南 東萊 所産이다. 氏가 仝行에 支配人으로 入銀한 以來 6, 7년간을 專務 金䄵洙氏의 補佐役으로의 任務도 任務려니와 仝行의 흔들이든 基盤을 今日과 가치 鞏固케 하여 노흔데 큰 功과 力量을 發揮한 것이 今日 專務 兼 支配人이라는 要職으로 昇次한 動機가 될 것이다. 氏가 專務로 仝行을 金䄵洙氏를 代하야 支配하게 된 것은 昨秋이다.
文尙宇氏로 論하면 海東銀行關係者 밋 其他 幾十名의 知舊親戚 외에는 그의 氏名조차 記憶하는 사람이 적을 것이니 이것이 氏의 全貌이다. 卽 社會로서나 個人으로나 또는 名望으로서나 아모 存在를 차질 길 업다는 것이다. 氏의 爲人이 內沈的이오 外進的이 아님에도 起因하거니와 氏는 언제든지 內實만을 圖謀하고 外觀은 不顧하는데서 그의 姓名이 밧갓흐로 들어나지 못한 것이다. 얼는 말하자면 氏는 操身守分하는 村새님의 風度만 固守하고 時體銀行家들과 가치 權謀術數을 다하야 左衝右突하며 境界線을 녓보는 사람이 아니다. 어듸까지 穩健眞實하야 下石上撑도 못하고 俗 所謂 『제털 빼어 제구녁에 박는 사람』의 堅實한 것이 氏이다. 이것이 私生活도 그대로 反映하야 行動擧之가<73> 『판』에 박은 듯 하다.
그러나 氏는 결코 無爲無能한 사람이 아니다. 氏는 일즉이 朝鮮에서 所定의 學校階段를 치르고 負芨渡東하야 모든 것을 다-버리고 商界의 勇躍할 素質을 싸코저 東京高商에 籍을 두고 螢雪의 功을 싸허 仝校를 畢한 후 錦衣로 還鄕하야 釜山 某銀行에서 勤務하며 亦是 同一한 行路를 밟어오며 功을 싸허 드듸어 支配人으로 잇게 되엇다. 氏는 元來 外交的 進取에 疏淡한 사람이라 여기서도 一貫한 主旨로 與人交際를 하여 나왓든 것이다. 私的 生活에 常規를 버서난 行動이 잇섯다 하야 一時 釜山社會에서 物議를 이르킨 일도 잇섯스나 엇쨌든 海銀에 知偶를 바더 今日의 域을 차지한 것이다. 이것은 論外로 하거니와 氏가 海銀의 專務가 된 지 日淺함으로 專務로의 手腕, 力量(後日 更論하려하거니와)은 未知數인 만큼 速評을 躊躇하거니와 氏의 平素行動과 支配人 當時의 行蹟으로 미루어 今後도 그러리라고 推想할 수 잇슴으로 暫時 人物을 評할까 한다.

前述한 바와 가치 文尙宇氏로 論하면 銀行關係者 以外에는 그 交涉이 狹小하야 氏에 대한 印象이나 平日 行動을 엿보아 알 수 업슬 만치 印象이 희미하거니와 筆者가 본 바로는 氏는 一見 村學者의 風인 同時에 매우 쌀쌀하고 엄격하다는 첫 늣김을 갓게 한다. 매물스러운 품이 누구든지 容易히 그와 接觸할 수 업게 하며 의자에 지대어 안진 품이 豪然한 百萬長者 風이 업고 사람을 注視함에 그 눈빗의 힘잇는 것이 그야말로 용이히 건드리지 못하게 보힌다. 그뿐 아니라 그와 接語를 함에도 맷고 끄는 듯한 말의 『악센트』는 獨特한 그의 性格을 나타는 것이라는 巷談이 잇다. 또는 氏는 무엇이든지 한 번 마음에 실타고 미드면 千百萬人이 是라 하여도 고개를 내젓기를 躊躇치 안는 솜씨다.
그리고 氏의 된 품이 헌터럭을 빼어 萬사람을 살닐 수 잇다 하여도 그 털 빼기를 질겨 應諾치 안흘 人物이다. 所信에 향하야 猛進하는 것은 실로 感嘆하겟거니와 能小能大하게 包容과 寬恕의 情을 구하기는 그야말로 緣木求魚의 難事이며 一人을 擇用하야 信用하면 그 사람이 自退하기까지는 보아주랴는 眞摯한 態度에는 누구든지 驚異의 눈을 빗내지만 自己 手下에 쓰든 사람이나 或은 求請하는 사람을 指導斡旋하야 그 前途를 啓發하여 주랴는 好意는 차저 볼기 어럽다. 分錢에 愛着心도 갸륵하거니와 毫利에도 加減이 업는 徹頭徹尾한 志操에도 놀나올<74> 地境이라 한다. 頭腦가 明晳하고 理智에 長하고 剛直하고 緻密한 것과 內明하고 外順한 것은 어듸로 보든* 一銀行의 支配人이나 課長級의 事務的 人物임에는 第一位로 뽑어 세울 바이지만 大局을 通察하고 御人包容의 能과 頭腦級으로서의 局量 襟度가 廣大한 人物로는 多少 엇더할가 한다. 卽 말하면 一家庭에 比한다면 計入出量하는 主婦로는 適當한 사람이나, 上奉下率하고 門戶를 빗내일 主人의 資格은 업슬 사람이라고 評하고 십다. 맷긴 것은 빈틈 업시 料理하고 직혀나아갈지언정 創意突進하며 利害得失間, 大業을 遂成할 人은 아닌 것이다. 통트러 말하면 守分樂道할 사람일지언정 鴻業大成을 꿈꾸는 사람은 아니다. 이런 사람이야말로 飯素食飮水하고 股肱而寢之라도 樂亦在其中이라고 할 顔子의 徒이다.
그런데 이제 여기에 氏를 위하야 한 마듸 辨明할 것은 海東銀行가치 基礎가 늘 흔늘이든 銀行으로서는 氏가 업지 못할 一等 功身이라는 것이다. 後門送朗하고 前門迎賓하듯 걸핏하면 主腦者가 遞迭되고 資金의 變換으로 無配는 둘재치고 一時는 行員給料에도 골치를 다 알케되든 海銀이라 아모리 金性洙氏 財閥을 끼고 잇하더래도 革新 當初의 辛酸한 그때에 氏와 가튼 着實한 支配人인 아니엇고 一躍 世上의 榮名을 꿈꾸고 날뛰는 人物이 나타낫다면 그야말로 負焰入火의 大事休矣를 부르지지게 되엇슬 것이다. 여기에 氏가 빗나는 存在오 中興革新의 海銀功臣이 되는 것이다. 이에 氏가 얼마나 行金에 대하야 節用節儉을 하는지 아래에 쓰는 一片 小話를 紹介코저 한다.

때는 三昨年 가을(秋)節이라 한다. 京城에 어떠한 會를 開催하고 金融經濟, 商工, 其他 産業界의 諸問題를 討議하여 關係者에게 要望하고저 하는 뜻을 包含하며 各各 準備로 多少의 援助를 各銀과 數三 社會에 仰하게 되엇다는데 이것을 안 各행에서는 모다 自進하야 *分의 援助를 하엿는데 仝銀關係者가 此意로 文尙宇氏에게 幾分의 表示를 力* 하엿스나 氏는 當時 專務 金䄵洙氏에게 밀고 또 金氏는 文氏에게 밀어 結局 그 期日이 지가나매 發說하엿든 사람이 憤慨하엿다고.
엇재뜬 氏의 特色은 普通銀行主腦*와 가치 傲慢, 豪華, 放從치 안코 親切, 簡素, 冷靜한 人格의 所有者 것인만은 알어야 한다. (此項了)<75>
