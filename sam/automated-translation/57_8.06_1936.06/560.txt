Untitled
						Manhae Han Yongun

Hey, boy playing the flute
On the back of a cow in the slanting sun
If your cow has no work
Please load my worries onto it.

Loading them is not difficult, but
There is no place to unload them.<281>

**Summary**

This short poem by Manhae Han Yongun uses the simple image of a carefree boy on a cow to contrast with the speaker's heavy burden of worries. The speaker wishes to load these worries onto the idle cow, suggesting they are too heavy to bear alone. However, the final line reveals the deeper problem: even if the worries could be loaded, there is nowhere to ultimately put them down or resolve them. From a colonial history perspective, the poem can be interpreted as an allegorical expression of the pervasive sense of despair, inescapable suffering, or the burden of the Korean people under Japanese rule, themes common in Manhae's works. Historians might find it interesting as a subtle expression of national sentiment and the psychological weight of the colonial experience during a period of censorship.
