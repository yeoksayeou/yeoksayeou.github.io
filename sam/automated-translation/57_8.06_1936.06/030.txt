Have you tried dancing?
Have you tried dancing?

Kim Hwallan=American students, without exception, all do it. Even if young men and women embrace and dance, society does not view it as a problem. When I was in university, I occasionally watched.

Hŏ Hŏn=Well, I don't even know the steps well, but once when I went to some evening party in Washington, some noble lady asked me to dance. Reluctantly, I was pulled out, and we did the "waltz." After barely managing to follow along a couple of times, I ended up stepping on the tip of that woman's shoe. The dance stopped, and I was so embarrassed by my lack of manners that my face turned red, and I stood in a corner. Then the lady bowed back and said,
"Oh, I am sorry for asking you when you didn't know how to dance." I really broke out in a sweat then.

Pak Ŭnhye=I danced a bit in America during my university days. But Eastern women, no matter what, are short, so the steps don't quite match well with the male students. Among students who studied in America, could there be anyone, male or female, who came back without having danced at least once?

Yŏ Unhong=I have never danced. Whether it was when I was in America or when I was traveling around Europe, where would I have had the leisure to dance? Also, I didn't have the financial means. However, if there had been a need to learn dancing, perhaps I might have learned it already, but since that wasn't the case, I ended up never having tried it even once.

Pak Ch'anghun=I've completely turned my back on dancing. Whether it's because I'm not modern or for some other reason, I just dislike dancing for no reason. So, I don't even watch dancing.

Chŏng In'gwa=In America, most young men and women generally dance, but I was quite old already and was only interested in reading books, so I never danced, nor did it happen that I would. So I don't know how. However, when I was in America, I often went to dance halls to watch. <31>

**Summary**

This article presents a survey of prominent Korean figures in 1936, mostly intellectuals and elites who studied abroad (primarily in the US), asking about their experiences with Western-style dancing ("딴스"). Responses range from those who participated or observed it as a normal part of student life in America (Kim Hwallan, Pak Ŭnhye), to an embarrassing anecdote of trying (Hŏ Hŏn), to those who consciously avoided it due to lack of interest, time, money, or perceived inappropriateness (Yŏ Unhong, Pak Ch'anghun, Chŏng In'gwa). The article offers a glimpse into the varied reactions of the Korean elite to the influx of Western culture, specifically social dancing, during the Japanese colonial period. Historians might find it interesting for its portrayal of differing levels of cultural assimilation and resistance among Western-educated Koreans, reflecting broader societal debates about modernity and tradition under colonial rule.
