Elderly Gentlemen and Ladies After Twenty Years
Elderly Gentleman After Twenty Years (1)

Yun Ch'iho Serving as Chairman

Coming from a family known for its longevity generation after generation, the physique of Elder Chwaong Yun Ch'iho (佐翁 尹致昊氏), appearing today in the Chairman's seat, is upright enough to surpass that of a robust man. His voice, his posture! Having seen the scene twenty years ago when the Elder, then 60, celebrated his 60th birthday celebration ceremony amidst the praise of Cho Man-sik (曹晩植) and various other social guests at the Chŏngdong (貞洞) Church Hall in Seoul, the sight today of that Elder, now past 80, sitting in this Chairman's seat and delivering an opening address to representatives from various places at home and abroad, merely makes my emotions of twenty years ago repeat themselves.
Moreover, this hall used for today's domestic and international conference is the "Yun Ch'iho Memorial Hall" (尹致昊記念舘), newly built five years ago when Elder Chwaong threw in his entire personal fortune of 1,000,000 Wŏn, the money remaining after expenditures on education and religious work. Now, having calmed the winds and waves of his eighty years of life (八十平生 風浪息), his service to the nation was great, fitting for the occasion of spending his later years in peace and happiness.
After speaking in Korean, the Elder then gives a speech in English. It seems this is because many distinguished British and American figures have also come to this event. After seeing the resolutions passed by the various subcommittees on religious issues, educational issues, and industrial issues, I looked across at the Elder with his white beard and slender body, standing holding a celebratory cup with several hundred guests, and wished to send back to the Elder the phrase Mr. Yun Ch'iho had written and sent on a funeral banner (輓張) when Elder Wŏllam Yi Sang-jae (月南 李商在翁) passed away: "The winds and waves of eighty years cease, the fragrant name shines with the sun" (八十風浪息, 芳名興日輝).<46>

University President Kim Sŏng-su

Whether he earned money at Haedong Bank (海東銀行), whether he gathered money at Kyŏngsŏng Spinning (京城紡績), or whether it was because he had good ancestors and had much inherited wealth (世襲財産), let's put all such things aside. In any case, Mr. Kim Sŏng-su (金性洙氏), at the age of 60, has fulfilled the ideal he held since his youth, has now created a "University" with his own hands, and today is met with the grand commemorative ceremony of his inauguration as the first President of this University. During his youth, while at Waseda University (早稻田大學) in Tokyo, he was inspired by President Ōkuma (大隈總長) and since then had the single-minded devotion (拳拳一念) to build one "University" as the highest seat of learning for the Korean people. His creation of Chungang School (中央學校) was part of that effort, Posŏng College (普成專門) was also part of that effort, and now, throwing in the total family fortune of 2,000,000 Wŏn, he has finally completed the University that all people yearned for (萬人渴仰).
When he appeared, wearing a square cap like President Wilson seen in photographs and a long, flowing black gown, in a place where over ten thousand spectators were gathered and 3,000 robust youths (university students) stood solemnly (肅然), the crowd merely roared with cheers. Mr. Kim Sŏng-su, half-elderly at perhaps sixty-five or sixty-six, was overcome with emotion and could say no more, delivering only a three-phrase speech like Caesar returning triumphant to Rome:
"Having worked, today, I have arrived."<47>

Pak In-dŏk on the Atlantic

Known in her twenties as the "flower of Ihwa College" (梨花大學) in Seoul, celebrated as "Pak In-dŏk who sings well, Pak In-dŏk who speaks well," "Pak In-dŏk of fine appearance," she once studied abroad in America, and from then on displayed her talent (才氣) even in North America. Now—now meaning twenty years later, having reached the age of 50—she has become quite the international peace envoy (國際的 平和使節). Today, having received an invitation (囑請) from some university in the state of California, USA, she is crossing the Atlantic aboard a super-Queen liner of 83,000 tons, heading to Europe to forcefully argue (力說) for "human peace." It is truly a pity when a beautiful woman (佳人) ages, but what can be done about the way of the world (公道)? Her once fine complexion and radiant eyes may now be somewhat faded (褪色), yet her world-surpassing (盖世) English oratory, passion for peace, and broad knowledge (該博한 見識) gather upon her the reverence (尊崇) as "the great mother of world peace born of Chosŏn" wherever she goes.
Today's London Times carried an editorial welcoming Mrs. Pak, and there was even an article stating that the Prime Minister and his wife, along with the Lord Mayor of London and his wife, would invite Miss Pak to a dinner party (晩餐會).
According to Miss Pak's words to reporters from Britain, France, Germany (英佛獨), and Belgium (白國) who came for an interview, she says she will return to her homeland Chosŏn (故土 朝鮮) before she turns 60 and will now devote her full energy to making "Old Koreans" into "Young Koreans," which is welcome news.<48>

**Summary**

This 1936 article imagines the futures of three prominent Koreans twenty years later, in 1956. Yun Ch'iho is depicted as a respected 80-year-old elder presiding over meetings in a memorial hall he funded. Kim Sŏng-su is envisioned as the 60-year-old inaugural president of a university he finally established using his personal wealth, fulfilling a lifelong dream. Pak In-dŏk, at 50, is portrayed as an internationally celebrated peace envoy, lauded in Europe for her oratory and intellect, planning to return to Korea to contribute to its modernization. From a historical perspective, the article is interesting as it reflects Korean aspirations and projections of national achievement during the colonial period. Writing from 1936, the author imagines these figures, known for their work in education, business, and social activism, achieving significant milestones on both national and international stages by 1956, suggesting ideals of leadership, institution-building, and global recognition that resonated within Korean society under Japanese rule.

二十年後의 老紳士 淑女
二十年後의 老紳士(1)

議長노릇하는 尹致昊

世世長壽하는 집안이라, 오늘 議長席에 나타난 佐翁 尹致昊氏의 體軀는 壯者를 浚하리만치 굿굿한 바가 잇다. 그 語聲, 그 姿勢! 나는 20년전 翁이 60 當時 서울 貞洞 敎會堂에서 曹晩植 其他 여러 社會賓客의 讚賀 속에 回甲宴祝賀式 지내든 光景을 본지라, 오늘 80 지낸 저 翁이 이 議長席에 안저 海內海外에서 온 여러 곳 代表를 향하야 一場 開會辭하는 光景이 오직 20년 전의 내 感激을 되푸리하게 한다.
더구나 오늘 이 內外會議에 쓰는 이 會舘은, 佐翁이 敎育과 宗敎事業에 쓰고 남어지 돈 私財 100萬圓의 全財産을 던저 5년 전에 新築한 「尹致昊記念舘」이라, 이제는 八十平生 風浪息으로, 平和와 幸福의 晩年을 보내실 차름을 시기에 족하게, 民族에 대한 奉仕가 커섯다.
조선말로 한 다음 다시 翁은 英語로 演說한다. 이자리에는 英米名士도 만히 온 까닭인 듯. 나는 宗敎問題, 敎育問題, 産業問題의 여러 分科會議를 決議케 한 뒤 數百 賓客과 함께 祝杯를 들고 섯는 힌 수염, 가는 몸의 翁을 건너다 보고, 녯날 月南 李商在翁이 도라가섯슬 때 「八十風浪息, 芳名興日輝」라고 尹致昊氏가 輓張에 지어 보냇든 글구를 翁에게 도로 보내고 십헛다.<46>

大學總長의 金性洙

海東銀行에서 돈을 버을엇건, 京城紡績에서 돈을 모앗던, 또는 조흔 父祖를 가저 世襲財産이 만햇든 까닭이든, 그런 것은 다 不問에 부치고, 엇잿든 金性洙氏는 春秋 60에, 靑年時代로부터의 理想을 貫徹하여, 이제 自己 손으로 「大學」을 만들어 내엇고, 오늘은 마츰 이 初代의 大學總長에 就任하는 記念式盛典을 맛나게 된 것이다. 그는 靑年時代에 東京, 早稻田大學에 노일 때 大隈總長의 感化를 밧어, 以來 朝鮮사람의 最高學府로 「大學」 한나를 만들고저 拳拳一念하엿다. 그가 中央學校를 만든 것도 그 工作, 普成專門도 그 工作, 이제 一門의 總財産 200萬圓을 내던저, 끗끗내 萬人渴仰하든 大學完成을 하여 노은 터이다.
寫眞에서 보는 윌손總長가치 四角帽를 쓰고 길게 느리운 거문 커운을 입고, 萬餘 群衆이 모엿고, 3,000 健兒(大學生)가 肅然이 선 자리에서 그가 나타나자, 群衆은 오직 歡呼가 잇슬 뿐이엇다. 六十五六은 되엇슬 半老 金性洙氏는 感激에 마저 오직 더 말을 못하고, 羅馬에 개선한 시-자 모양으로
「일하여, 오늘에, 미첫노라」
하는 세 마듸 演說을 할 뿐이엇다.<47>

二十年後의 淑女(3)

太西洋上의 朴仁德

「노래 잘하는 朴仁德, 演說 잘하는 朴仁德」 「人物 잘난 朴仁德」 하고 二十之年에 서울「梨花大學의 꼿」으로 有名하더니, 米國에 한 번 遊學하자 그제부터는 또한 北米에까지 그 才氣를 發揮하여 오더니, 이제는-이제라 함은 春秋 50歲가 된 20년 후의 일-아조 國際的 平和使節이 되어, 오늘은 米國 칼니포니아洲의 무슨 大學의 囑請을 밧어 「人類平和」를 力說코저 歐羅巴로 가느라고 83,000噸의 超큐인 丸上에 안저 太西洋을 건느고 잇다. 佳人이 늙는 것은 참으로 앗가운 일이어나 公道를 엇저라, 곱든 살결 영채 잇든 눈도 이제는 조곰 褪色할가하나, 그러나 盖世의 英語演說과 平和를 위하는 情熱과 該博한 見識은 간 곳마다 「朝鮮이 나흔 偉大한 世界平和의 어머니」로서 尊崇을 一身에 모으고 잇다.
오늘의 倫敦타임쓰紙上에는 미세쓰, 朴歡迎辭의 社說이 실럿고 首相夫妻와 倫敦市長夫妻는 朴孃을 晩餐會에 招待하리란 記事가 나기까지 하엿다.
인터뷰로 온 英佛獨, 白國記者에 대하야한 孃의 말에 의하면 孃은 60전에 故土 朝鮮에 도라가 이제는 「올드코레안」을 「영, 코리안」만들기에 全力을 다하리라고 하니 반가운 消息이다.<48>
