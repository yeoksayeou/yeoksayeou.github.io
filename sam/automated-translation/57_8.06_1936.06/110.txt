Current Events Photo News

Regarding Mr. Hirota (廣田氏), who organized the new cabinet succeeding General Okada (岡田大將) following the recent Incident (事變), about 30 years ago from now, when he was in his 20s, there was a time he was stationed in Kyŏngsŏng (京城) as an official of the former Korean Residency-General (舊韓國統監府員). (Photo is of Prime Minister Hirota during his time as an official of the Residency-General)

**Summary**

This short news item reports on the appointment of Hirota Kōki as the new Prime Minister of Japan, succeeding Okada Keisuke after the recent "Incident" (referring to the February 26 Incident of 1936). It highlights Hirota's past connection to Korea, noting he served as an official in the Korean Residency-General in Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul) approximately 30 years prior, when he was in his twenties. For historians, this piece is interesting as it shows contemporary Korean media acknowledging significant political shifts in Japan and specifically linking the new Japanese Prime Minister to the earlier phase of colonial administration in Korea (the Residency-General period, 1906-1910), potentially reminding readers of the long-standing involvement of Japanese leadership figures in Korean affairs.
