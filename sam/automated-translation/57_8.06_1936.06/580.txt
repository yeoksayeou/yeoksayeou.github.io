The Sound of My Beloved
						By Yun Kŭgyŏng

Because that moon has already waned by half,
I thought this night too would pass in loneliness,
But dry leaves rustle, rustle—is someone coming?
Is it my beloved's footstep, or the sound of the wind?<284>

Cuckoos cry and cry on this sorrowful night;
I thought perhaps I'd untangle the messy skein,
But the window rattles—is someone calling me?
Is it my beloved's voice, or the sound of water?

Flower blossoms are many.
Beneath a clearly opened sky,
Upon the green grass,
Swallows crisscross
And butterflies flutter—
Who has painted them there?
Only the flower blossoms are red.

Upon the long, long river,
On the ferryboat gliding along,
A pipe light flickers,
And smoke rises—
Who has painted it there?
Only the crescent moon is white.<285>

**Summary**

This poem by Yun Kŭgyŏng expresses a sense of longing and anticipation for a beloved ("nim"). The speaker, feeling lonely under a waning moon, mistakes the sounds of nature – rustling leaves, rattling windows, wind, water – for the arrival or voice of their beloved. The poem then shifts to contrasting natural imagery: vibrant red flowers and butterflies under a clear sky, and a white crescent moon reflected near a ferryboat on a river at night. The recurring question "Who has painted them there?" adds a touch of wonder or perhaps melancholy to the scenes. From a historical perspective, the poem, published in 1936 during Japanese rule, uses traditional Korean lyrical themes and natural imagery. While not overtly political, the theme of longing for a "nim" (beloved, often used broadly in Korean literature) and the focus on Korean landscapes could be seen by historians as a subtle expression of cultural identity and perhaps a veiled yearning during a difficult period. The use of Hangul and traditional poetic forms in a major contemporary magazine like *Samch'ŏlli* is also significant.

내 님의 소리
						尹克榮
저 달이 절 半이나 기우럿기에
이 한밤두 외로히 지나햇떠니
가랑닙 바삭바삭 누가 오시나
내님의 발소린가 바람 소린가<284>
뻑꾹이 울어울어 구슯흔 이 밤
엉크러진 실태나 풀가햇떠니
窓이 운다 그 누가 날부르시나
내 님의 말소린가 물소린가
꼿송이 만희다
맑게 개인 하늘까에
푸른 잔듸 그 우에
제비가 넘나들고
나븨 나는데
그 누가 거렷는지
꼿송이만 붉다


기나긴 저 江물을
타고가는 나룻빼에
담뱃불 깜박이고
연긔나는데
그 누가 거렷는지
초승달만 희다<285>
<284-285>
