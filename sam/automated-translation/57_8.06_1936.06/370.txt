Samch'ŏlli Apricot Blossom Village
An Eight-Member Group of Kisaeng Saving 40,000 Won

In Seoul (서울 長安), there is an eight-member group of kisaeng who are diligently making fixed-term savings deposits of 125 Won each month. This began as a 5,000 Won savings deposit account at the Savings Bank (貯蓄銀行). Among them, some are already close to reaching the 5,000 Won mark, while others have just started.

Of course, these various kisaeng are not only saving in this 5,000 Won account; perhaps they have separately deposited larger sums in fixed-term accounts (定期預金), or maybe they are buying land, paddy fields, or plots (마직).

These eight kisaeng are said to be:
Kang Yŏn-O (姜蓮O), Ch'oe O-Hŭi (崔O姬), Yi Hyŏn-O (李賢O), Sŏl O-Hŭi (薜O姬), Sŏnu OO (鮮于OO), Chŏn O-Sim (全O心), Kim OO (金OO), Kang O-Hong (康O紅). In this way, it seems the grand sum of 40,000 Won in savings will soon <193> be completed by the hands of these eight kisaeng. If it's going to happen anyway, one wishes they would use that 40,000 Won to establish a school.

Kisaeng Who Have Saved Much Money

When speaking of kisaeng who have saved much money, those of the level of U San-ok (禹山玉) and Pang Wŏl-sŏn (方月仙) were rumored (所聞) to have anywhere from 70,000-80,000 Won to over 100,000 Won. Even if not reaching that level, there are numerous kisaeng who have settled down having saved several tens of thousands of Won or several thousand Won. Counting the kisaeng who save money now, there are:
Kim Ch'ae-hong (金彩紅), Yu Kŭm-do (劉錦桃), Yi Hwa-sŏn (李花仙), Yi Ch'un-hong (李春紅), Yi Hyŏn-jŏng (李賢貞), Pak Myŏng-wŏl (朴明月), etc. Also, kisaeng with telephones (電話) in their own homes (自宅) = Chŏng Hae-wŏl (鄭海月), Yi Hyŏn-jŏng (李賢貞), Yi Ch'un-hong (李春紅) <194>

**Summary**

This short article from 1936 reports on a group of eight kisaeng in Seoul who are collectively saving towards a goal of 40,000 Won by contributing 125 Won each month to individual 5,000 Won savings accounts. The article lists their (partially obscured) names and mentions that they might have other savings or investments. It also names other famously wealthy kisaeng like U San-ok and Pang Wŏl-sŏn, rumored to possess fortunes up to 100,000 Won, and lists several others known for saving substantial sums or having telephones in their homes. The piece concludes with a remark suggesting it would be commendable if the eight kisaeng used their eventual 40,000 Won savings to establish a school. From a historical perspective, the article is interesting for its insight into the economic activities and relative wealth achievable by some kisaeng during the colonial period, challenging simplistic views of their status. The mention of specific savings plans, bank accounts, potential investments, and luxury items like private telephones highlights their financial agency, while the concluding wish for a school reflects contemporary social commentary or aspirations linked to wealth accumulation.
