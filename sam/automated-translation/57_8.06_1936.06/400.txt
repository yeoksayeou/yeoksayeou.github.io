Article Title: 謹告 (Correction Notice)
Author: Not specified (likely Editorial Staff)
Article Type: 사고·편집후기 (Correction/Editorial Note)

An article by Mr. Im Wŏn-gŭn regarding An To-san's activities (安島山舞臺), published in this magazine's previous month's issue, was in reality something that should have been included in the article about General Chiang Kai-shek (蔣介石 將軍), but was mistakenly placed. We deeply apologize to the writer and readers.

**Summary**

This is a correction notice from the *Samch'ŏlli* magazine editors. It states that an article by Im Wŏn-gŭn concerning An To-san (likely An Changho), which appeared in the previous issue, was misplaced. It should have been part of an article discussing General Chiang Kai-shek. The editors express their sincere apologies for this error to both the author and the readership. For historians, this notice is interesting as it explicitly links discussions of Korean figures like Im Wŏn-gŭn and An Changho (a major independence activist) with the prominent Chinese leader Chiang Kai-shek, potentially reflecting the interconnectedness of political discourse or nationalist movements in East Asia during the period, or perhaps comparisons being drawn between them. The need for a public correction might also hint at the sensitivity surrounding these figures under Japanese colonial rule.
