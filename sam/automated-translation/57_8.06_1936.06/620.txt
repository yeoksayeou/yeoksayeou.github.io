Sin Pulch’ul

Good things are compared to flowers, said to be like flowers,
But the goodness of flowers, to what can it be compared?
Leave it be, let us just call them flowers as they are.

Though there are countless flowers, if it's a flower, all are good.
Do not ever say just one kind of flower is better.
I worry that other flowers might harbor resentment and refuse to bloom.

If it's a flower, one cherishes it, yet the heart picks it the better it is.
If picking is my fault, then being good is your fault.
If there is any remaining blame, I want to push it onto you.<289>

**Summary**

This three-stanza poem by Sin Pulch'ul uses the metaphor of flowers to contemplate beauty and affection. The first stanza marvels at the singular beauty of flowers, incomparable to anything else. The second expresses a universal appreciation for all flowers, warning against favoritism lest others become resentful. The final stanza playfully addresses the conflict between cherishing a flower and the desire to possess its beauty by picking it, shifting the blame onto the flower's own inherent goodness. From a historical perspective, the poem, published in 1936 colonial Korea, offers a glimpse into lyrical expression focused on nature during a period of restricted cultural and political discourse. Its use of traditional poetic sensibility and older Korean language forms (like '곻다' for '좋다') provides linguistic interest for historians studying language evolution and cultural continuity under colonialism.

곻은 것을 꽃 비겨 꽃과 같다 하거니와
꽃의 곻은 양은 무어세다 비할거나
두어라 그냥 그대로 꽃라만 하리라

허구 많은 꽃이연만 꽃이라면 다 좋을세
어느 꽃 한 가지만 더욱 좋타 행여마소
다른 꽃 노염 품고서 아니필까 저어라

꽃이면 액기거늘 곻을사록 꺾는 심사
꺾는게 내 죄라면 곻은 것은 네 죄로다
남어지 허물 있다면 네게 밀고 싶구나<289>
