漢陽相會一夕吟
花谷 尹益善

五道縮來此一筵
滿員共樂坐談圓
衆心歸一一家化
妙舞無隻雙手扇
淸美親疎燒火鉢
開張抱負露心田
莫言今夕偶然合
德必有隣西北鮮

A Verse Composed One Evening at a Meeting in Hanyang
Hwagok Yun Ik-sŏn

From five provinces condensed, we gather at this one banquet,
A full assembly enjoys together, seated conversation harmonious.
Many hearts return to one, becoming a single family,
Wondrous dance without match, fans in both hands.
Clear beauty, near or far, gathers round the brazier’s fire,
Opening ambitions unfold, revealing the heart's field.
Do not say tonight's meeting is mere coincidence,
Virtue surely has neighbors, in the Northwest of Korea (西北鮮).

白峰 辛鍾革

五道俊英共一筵
史官應奏德星圓
滿堂和氣春風暖
範世雄圖曙色扇
少妓藝歌淸耳郭
偉人講演坧心田
衆眉自聳韓吾舞
願此舞才舞擧鮮

Paekpong Sin Chong-hyŏk

Talented youth from five provinces share one banquet,
The historian should report the auspicious star is full and round.
The whole hall filled with harmony, warm as a spring breeze,
A model for the world, grand plans like the fanning dawn light.
A young entertainer's skillful song clears the contours of the ear,
A great person's lecture expands the field of the heart.
All eyebrows rise naturally at our Korean dance,
May these dancing talents dance throughout Korea (鮮).

*隱 姜玩熙

七八年來成好筵
五星聚集一天圓
月明西北照臨地
風動中央吹合扇
養俊必期勤設校
貯財常在勉耕田
人間無敵積功者
六大江山從此鮮

*Ŭn Kang Wan-hŭi

For seven or eight years, a fine banquet has formed,
Five stars gather, making one heaven complete.
The bright moon illuminates the land of the Northwest,
Wind moves in the center, blowing fans together.
To nurture talent, we must diligently establish schools,
Storing wealth always lies in striving to cultivate the fields.
Among humans, invincible are those who accumulate merit,
From this, the great rivers and mountains of the six continents (六大江山) will be fresh/renewed (鮮).

遊山觀感
花谷 尹益善

巨岩中斷谷心開
一脉小泉滾滾來
激石穿林流不息
終成大海放聲廻

Impressions from Mountain Roaming
Hwagok Yun Ik-sŏn

A giant rock is cut midway, the valley's heart opens,
A single thread of a small spring comes bubbling forth.
Striking stones, piercing the forest, it flows without cease,
Finally becoming a great sea, it lets out its voice and returns.

花蝶
樹紅一㭆翅雙白
香露這邊接吻來
欲買花心全當愛
故張善舞幾徊徘

Flower and Butterfly
A single stem of red on the tree, a pair of white wings,
Towards the fragrant dew here, it comes to kiss.
Wishing to buy the flower's heart entirely deserves love,
Thus it spreads its skillful dance, how many times it flutters around.

養病南郊
金陵人

丙子春傷健康養病於漢水南明水臺藥水洞

南郊病臥數三旬
男兒生涯多恨處
欄外淚㾗一片雲
冬寒尙在不成春<45>

Recuperating in the Southern Suburbs
Kŭmnŭngin

Injuring my health in the spring of Pyŏngja (1936), recuperating south of the Han River at Myŏngsutae, Yaksutong.

Lying ill in the southern suburbs for several decades (likely means 'several ten-day periods', i.e. 20-30 days),
A man's life has many places for regret.
Beyond the railing, tear stains like a patch of cloud,
Winter's cold still lingers, not yet becoming spring.<45>

**Summary**

This collection features several classical Chinese-style poems (Hansi) by Korean intellectuals published in 1936. The first three poems by Yun Ik-sŏn, Sin Chong-hyŏk, and Kang Wan-hŭi celebrate a gathering in Hanyang (Seoul) of people from "five provinces," emphasizing unity, shared aspirations for Korea's future ("grand plans," "nurturing talent," "establishing schools"), and pride in Korean culture ("Our Korean dance"). Yun Ik-sŏn contributes two shorter nature poems, one using a stream growing into the sea as a metaphor, the other observing a butterfly. The final poem by "Kŭmnŭngin" is a personal reflection on illness and regret while recuperating near the Han River.

For historians, these poems offer insights into the sentiments of some Korean intellectuals during the colonial period. The themes of unity ("Many hearts return to one"), national aspiration (desire for development through education and effort), cultural pride (highlighting Korean dance), and a focus on specific regions like the "Northwest" (西北鮮) are notable. The blend of classical forms with contemporary concerns and the expression of hope and ambition amidst the constraints of colonial rule provide a valuable glimpse into the cultural and intellectual life of the time. The final poem adds a personal dimension, reflecting melancholy and the hardships of life, possibly exacerbated by the political situation.
