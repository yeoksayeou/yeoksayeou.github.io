**Body Text Translation**
A Letter Before My Beloved
						Yun Kŭk-yŏng

"Clusters upon clusters of pear blossoms,
Though they smile on every branch,<282>
The coming and going butterflies
Act as if they don't even see."
Thus, I write
This letter before my beloved.

"Though that winding, winding water
Pushes forth and calls out,
The ferryboat crossing over
Acts as if it doesn't even see."
Thus, I write
This letter before my beloved.

"Though my loosened, loosened hair
Becomes like a weeping willow,
This wind and that wind passing by
Act as if they don't even see."
Thus, I write
This letter before my beloved.<283>

**Summary**

This poem by Yun Kŭk-yŏng uses metaphors from nature—pear blossoms ignored by butterflies, flowing water ignored by a ferryboat, and a willow-like figure ignored by the wind—to express feelings of being unnoticed or disregarded by a beloved person ("우리님"). Each stanza repeats the refrain of something beautiful or evocative being treated with indifference ("본-체 만-체"), mirroring the speaker's own feeling of sending an unanswered "letter" (or plea) to their beloved. From a historical perspective, the poem reflects the continuation of personal lyrical traditions during the colonial period. While seemingly a simple love poem, the persistent imagery of being ignored despite clear presence or appeal might resonate with historians studying subtle expressions of feeling or unspoken pleas within the constraints of the era.
