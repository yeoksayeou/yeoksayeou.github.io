Having Finished Editing

★Climbing up to the fourth-floor office of the Samch'ŏlli Company on what feels like the Changan Great Road (長安大路), bustling like the whole world under heaven, and looking down upon the Chongno crossroads teeming with people and horses on a spring day, I am enveloped in a truly pleasant (■快한) feeling, as if the great trends of the world might just move centered on this very street. With this feeling, courage we didn't have before newly springs forth, and like water rising in a dry tree, our pens and inkstones (筆硯) are becoming refreshed.

★Because you all avidly read the April special issue, we sold out the enormous number of copies (巨大한 部數) completely, and we were unable to fulfill (酬應) orders received after April 6th. Unavoidably (不得已), we decided to send this month's issue as a substitute (代送). When we think of the intention () of all the readers (先生) who support *Samch'ŏlli* like this, we, the editorial staff members all together (編輯局員一同), are simply filled with gratitude (感激).<300>

**Summary**

This editorial postscript expresses the editors' renewed motivation, inspired by the bustling view of Chongno Crossroads from their office, and deep gratitude towards the readers for their enthusiastic support. It specifically mentions that the April special issue sold out completely, necessitating substitution with the current issue for later orders. From a historical perspective, the piece highlights the significant readership and success of a Korean-language magazine like *Samch'ŏlli* during the Japanese colonial period, indicating a strong desire for Korean cultural content. The editors' sense of pride and connection to the vibrant street life of Seoul (Keijō) is also notable.
