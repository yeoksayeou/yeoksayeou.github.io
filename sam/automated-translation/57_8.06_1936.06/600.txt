Fine Rain
						Yun Kŭk-yŏng

Fine rain falls upon the earth,
Seeps beneath the earth,
Winter passes.
Turns over like the finished pages of a book (冊).
How could one dream of the coming spring's prelude (序曲)?
That bird on the branch too,
Soaked in rain, is silent.

Fine rain weeps, a lonely heart.
My love sleeps in the mountains (山), three years (三年) have passed.
How can I respond (和答) to this year's spring prelude (序曲)?
The nursing baby's large eyes,
The mother's sorrowful face,
Looks and looks, and smiles.<287>

**Summary**

This poem by Yun Kŭk-yŏng uses the imagery of fine rain ("sil-bi") to depict the transition from winter to spring. The first stanza describes the quiet, natural process of seasonal change, comparing winter's end to finishing a book. The second stanza introduces a personal, sorrowful tone, contrasting the arrival of spring with the speaker's enduring grief for a loved one who has been gone for three years. The poem concludes with the image of a nursing baby smiling at its sad mother, juxtaposing innocence and sorrow, perhaps hinting at life's continuation amidst grief. From a historical perspective, the poem offers insight into personal expressions of melancholy and loss during the colonial period. While not overtly political, the themes of enduring sorrow, the passage of time, and the quiet resilience suggested by the final image might reflect the broader emotional landscape of Koreans at the time. The poem's language, including older spellings, is also of linguistic interest.
