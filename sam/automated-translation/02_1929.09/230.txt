On the day after Byron got married, he received an envious congratulatory letter from a friend saying, “Surely you must have spent a good night last night,” and immediately wrote a reply:

“Around four in the morning, I opened my eyes, and it felt somehow like I had fallen into hell. I raised my hands and groped about, grasping bare legs and a bare neck. I have never had a time of such shock and dismay (치락한담) as that moment. Because I realized I was married.” <32>

**Summary**

This short piece recounts a cynical anecdote attributed to the poet Byron about his wedding night. Responding to a friend's congratulations, Byron describes waking up next to his wife as feeling like hell, a moment of shock realizing he was married. From a historical perspective, the article is interesting as it features a well-known Western figure (Byron) in a Korean publication from the colonial period, indicating cultural awareness and exchange. The specific joke, playing on the potential disillusionment following marriage, might offer a small glimpse into social humor or attitudes towards marriage at the time, presented through a foreign lens.
