Ideal Husband
						Chat Room/Miscellany Section

Sim Ŭn-suk, a female orator of the Kŭnuhoe (槿友會), went to a certain region called S in South Chosŏn (南朝鮮) for a lecture tour, taking up women's issues. The chief (X長) there summoned Miss Sim and, after setting a precondition that permission for this lecture would only be granted if she answered his question well, finally asked, "Tell me your type of ideal husband."

The upright Miss Sim, of course, engaged in a heated argument right then and there. Consequently, due to the official's (官長) displeasure, she was even detained...

Hearing this, a certain female activist became greatly indignant (憤慨大憤慨), saying, "[If it were me], I would have answered, 'A fellow just like you (당신가치 되어먹은 년석) would be perfect!'"<10>

**Summary**

The article recounts an incident where Sim Ŭn-suk, a female orator from the Kŭnuhoe organization, faced obstruction from a local official in southern Korea while on a lecture tour about women's issues. The official demanded she describe her "ideal husband" as a condition for allowing the lecture. Sim refused, argued, and was subsequently detained. Another female activist reacted with indignation, suggesting a sarcastic retort Sim could have used against the official. Historically, this anecdote illustrates the difficulties and harassment faced by early Korean feminist activists operating under the constraints of both traditional patriarchy and Japanese colonial rule. The official's trivializing question and abuse of power highlight the resistance these women encountered while advocating for social change.
