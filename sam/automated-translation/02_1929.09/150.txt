The woman a woman likes is the woman in the mirror.

Men earn money, and women keep it.

A single strand of a woman's hair is stronger than steel.<15>

**Summary**

This short piece consists of three aphorisms concerning women. The first suggests a woman's primary focus of admiration is her own reflection. The second presents a traditional division of labor where men earn money and women manage or guard it. The third uses hyperbole to emphasize the perceived strength or influence of women. From a historical perspective, these brief statements offer insight into common societal views or stereotypes about women's vanity, domestic financial roles, and perceived power or resilience in colonial Korea during the late 1920s.
