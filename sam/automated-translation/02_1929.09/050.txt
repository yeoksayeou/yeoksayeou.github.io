Mental Test of the Famous

Though the distance between flowers (花草) and human life (人生) may be vast, the distance between things like the Bank of Chosŏn (朝鮮銀行), the Oriental Development Company (東拓), the Industrial Bank (殖銀), Chin'gogae (진고개), etc., and Chosŏn is certainly close. Ms. Ch'ilsŏng (七星孃)'s residence (though rented) occupies the third floor by Mugyo (武橋) bridge, from where she can survey (俯瞰) all these buildings day and night (旦夕), so shall we say she has first secured a favourable location (地利)? Here, sitting and standing, she observes the current state (姿態) of Chosŏn (現實朝鮮) and is unfolding a courageous struggle (鬪爭). We briefly detained Ms. Ch'ilsŏng, who is like a crane (鶴), pure yet not gaunt (淸而不瘦), while she was busy with the Kŭnuhwe (槿友會) National Convention, and, though it may be rude (失禮), attempted a test of her mind (頭腦試驗).

"In the East (東洋), they still view a divorced woman (女子) as a sinner (罪人) or as an ugly woman. Do you think so?"

"Absolutely not—absolutely, utterly not!"

She refuted it at length in her pleasant Kyŏngsang Province accent. Her manner was exceedingly fierce (形勢甚猛烈).

"Then what about the idea that a woman should follow her parents (父母) when young, her husband when married, and her son (子息) when widowed?"

"What is that?"

"It's the Three Bonds and Five Relations (三綱五倫), isn't it? No, just the Three Bonds (三綱) without the Five Relations."

"Oh, please stop!"

Smiling faintly, she instantly dismissed it with ridicule (言下에 嘲笑而退之). Her wisdom (智略) and tactics (戰術) are those of a modern-day Zhang Zifang (今世張子房). Now, only the final blow (最後의 一擊) remains to be tried.

"In Kollontai's (꼬론타이) novel (小說), it was said that female virginity (處女性) is not that important (重要). What do you think?"

"I don't know about such things!" she said, blushing slightly.

"Also, it's said that even if a husband has relations with another woman while his wife is away, it should be forgiven as an act of physiological inevitability (生理的 不可抗力). That's supposed to be the 'New Woman's Morality' (新婦人道德). What do you think, Ms. Ch'ilsŏng?"

"That it's a physiological aspect (生理的 方面) is correct, and perhaps unavoidable (不可避). But whether that's right or wrong, I don't know!"

A smile of satisfaction (得意의 微笑) spread across her refreshing face. If we were to compare Ms. Ch'ilsŏng to a flower, begging her pardon, she is not a camellia or azalea, but a crape myrtle (百日紅) with large blossoms that bloom for a long time; rather than a strongly fragrant rose, she is like a graceful (雅淡) plum blossom (梅花). = Score (採点): 9 points, Excellent (優等).<7>

**Summary**

This 1929 article features an interview, framed as a "mental test," with Chŏng Ch'ilsŏng, the chairwoman of the Kŭnuhwe women's organization. The interviewer quizzes her on contemporary issues affecting women: the stigma of divorce, the traditional "Three Obediences," the importance of virginity (referencing Alexandra Kollontai), and tolerating marital infidelity as a "physiological inevitability" associated with the "New Woman." Chŏng firmly rejects traditional views on divorce and female subservience but responds more ambivalently regarding sexuality and infidelity, acknowledging physiological aspects while declining to make moral judgments. The interviewer concludes by praising her intelligence and comparing her to enduring, graceful flowers, awarding her a high score. For historians, the article offers a valuable glimpse into the evolving discourse on women's roles and "modern" ideas clashing with tradition in colonial Korea, particularly within organized women's movements like the Kŭnuhwe. The specific questions about Kollontai and "New Woman's Morality" highlight the transnational flow of feminist and socialist ideas and the complex ways they were debated and adapted in the Korean context.

名士의 멘탈테스트
花草와 人生의 距離는 먼지 모르지만 朝鮮銀行이나 東拓, 殖銀, 진고개 等과 朝鮮의 距離만은 確實히 갓갑다. 七星孃?의 住宅(셋집이나마)은 이 모든 建物을 旦夕으로 俯瞰할 수 잇는 武橋다릿가 三層樓上를 차지하엿스니 爲先 地利를 어덧다할가 여기서 안즈며 서며 현실조선의 姿態를 바라보면서 果敢한 鬪爭을 展開하고 게시다. 淸而不瘦 鶴두름가튼 氏를 槿友會 全國大會로 분주하다는 것을 잠간 붓잡고 失禮지만 頭腦試驗를 試하다.
「東洋서는 아직도 離婚한 女子를 罪人이라고 또는 못생긴 女子라고 보니 그럴가요?」
「천만에 온-천만에 당초에 천만에」
하여가며 듯기 조흔 「경상도」 말찌로 한참 집어 세운다. 그 形勢甚猛烈
「그러면 어러서는 父母를 쫏고 시집 가서는 남편을 쫏고 과수 되어서는 그 자식을 쪼처야 한다는 것은?」
「그게 무엔가요.」
「三綱五倫이지요. 아니 五倫이 빠진 三綱이지요.」
「아스서요. 제발!」
빙긋 우스며 言下에 嘲笑而退之한다. 그 智略과 戰術이 今世張子房이다. 이제는 最後의 一擊이나 試할밧게.
「꼬론타이의 小說에는 女子의 處女性이란 그러케 重要한 것이 못된다고 하엿든데요.」
「그런건 난 몰라요!」하고 조곰 낫츨 붉힌다.
「또 안해 업는 사이에 남편이 딴 녀자를 상관하여도 그것은 生理的 不可抗力의 일이라고 용서하여야 한다는데요. 그것이 新婦人道德이라는데 七星氏는 엇대요.」
「生理的 方面인 것은 올코 또는 不可避겟지요. 그러나 그게 올코 그른 것은 난 몰라요!」
시언스럽게 생긴 그 얼골에는 得意의 微笑가 흐른다. 失禮지만 氏를 꼿에 비긴다면 동백꼿이나 진랄내라기보다 송이가 크고 오래 피는 百日紅이요. 향기 독한 장미화라기 보다 雅淡한 梅花꼿이라 할 것이다. = 採点 9点으로 優等.＜7＞
