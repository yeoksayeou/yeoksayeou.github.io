Mental Test of a Famous Person

In Chosŏn, the figures who stand most prominently at the focal point of popularity, whether good or bad, are newspaper presidents. Among them, Mr. Song Chin-u (宋鎭禹氏) has often received arrows of both praise and censure whenever political or social ripples (波紋) arise from various incidents. This fact signifies his dynamic (動的) character, and at the same time, it likely happens because of his politician-like disposition (素性) which always prioritizes and pursues real-world conditions (현실조건) over any consistent ideology (주의). In any case (엇재뜬), perhaps having gained perspective as he approaches the age of forty (春秋-不惑), these days he rides a rickshaw from his home in Wŏn-dong (苑洞) daily, arms folded, with a broad smile, commuting to the Dong-A Ilbo (東亞日報社). Even if asked what makes him so happy (깁부심니까), he seems likely to respond, "Smiles without answering, the heart is naturally calm (笑而不答心自閑)." We found him on a hot day during the three summer peaks (三伏) in the President's office of the Dong-A building (黃士峴 東亞社屋), which gives the fresh feeling of a great ship (巨船) sailing through the ocean waves.

"What if a lot of American capital were to come into Chosŏn? Would our lives improve a bit (나서지리까요)?" With apologies, I threw the first arrow of the mental test (頭惱試驗), and he immediately replied,

"Of course, it would be good (무론 조치요)!"

He then spoke eloquently for several hundred words (滔滔數百言) on the unemployment problem (失業問題), the price problem (物價問題), and myriad other problems (汎百問題) (the content is omitted for certain reasons). Then, gently turning the rudder,

"However, that money must be used primarily for the happiness of the Chosŏn people, with us as the main subject (主軆)..." he emphasized in his conclusion. Even if transcribed as is, it seemed like a well-ordered thesis (論文), logical and orderly (條理井然), with a weighty tone (語勢沈重). Regrettably, the hardships of prison (獄中勞苦) have prematurely aged him, greatly damaging his appearance (風采). Finally,

"How should we proceed?"

Mr. Song paused for a moment, then softly but heavily replied,

"There is nothing else but to strive nationally (민족뎍으로 로력할 밧게)..."

Just one phrase. In his day, Mr. Song, was he a hero? He often provided topics of conversation in the capital (京重) with rumored love affairs (艶聞) fitting a hero's supposed love of beauty (英雄? 好色) and the "Rickshaw Second-Class Incident" (人力車二等事件). Now, he seems busy building a new house (새 집). Is he managing his household and property (治家治産)? However, the way of managing a household (治家의 道)—the way of staying home for life (臥席終身의 道)—is a path that gentlemen in turbulent times (亂世) gladly choose not to take???

Pardon the impoliteness, but if we were to compare Mr. Song to a bird, he would be like a hawk (수리개) of the vast sky, capable of bending and stretching (能屈能伸), possessing much strategic skill (權謀術數), and always having an aggressive (攻擊的) and domineering (專制的) spirit. Today's score: 8 points, a pass (及第). <29>

**Summary**

This 1929 article from *Samch'ŏlli* magazine features an interview with Song Chin-u, the president of the Dong-A Ilbo newspaper. Song expresses cautious optimism about American investment in Korea, stipulating it must prioritize Korean benefit. When asked about the future path, he emphasizes the need for national effort. The author describes Song as a dynamic, pragmatic, and somewhat aged figure due to past imprisonment, noting his history of public scandals but current focus on building a home. The article concludes by characterizing Song as adaptable, strategic, and aggressive like a hawk, giving him a passing grade of 8 points on this "mental test." For historians, the article offers a glimpse into the mindset of a prominent Korean nationalist figure during the colonial period, particularly his views on foreign capital's role in national development and the emphasis on collective "national striving" (민족적 노력). Song's cautious endorsement of American investment, conditional on Korean benefit, reflects complex attitudes towards foreign influence amidst Japanese rule. The author's slightly critical yet respectful tone and commentary on Song's past and present also provide insight into contemporary perceptions of elite figures.
