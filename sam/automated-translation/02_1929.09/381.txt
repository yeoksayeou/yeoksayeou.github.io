◇After Editing◇
▲This time, we have put out the Pioneer Issue (先驅者號). Just as there is no one in the world more deserving of gratitude than those who open new paths, unfortunately, our chaotic society fails even to recognize this. We believe that the standard for criticizing Chosŏn's civilization should arise centered on the achievements of these pioneers, and though late, we have dared to introduce the pioneers of the modern era. However, besides politics, religion, literature, film, and theater, we should have covered social thought, various sciences, economics, etc., but due to various circumstances, we had to omit them (割愛). We plan to supplement this in a later opportunity (後機), so we ask for your understanding (諒解).

▲Also, we had intended to include an "Overview of Contemporary Chosŏn Thinkers and Literary Figures" (朝鮮現代의 思想家 文藝家 總覽) in this issue, but due to lack of preparation, it has been pushed to the next issue (次號). Furthermore, due to censorship-related matters (敬關係), various novels and essays have also been pushed to the next issue. Please understand this as well.

▲Regarding the "Eight Views of the Peninsula" (半島八景), a unique plan of this company, as announced separately (別項社告), first-rate painters (一流畫士) have been arranged to participate (出陣하기), so it will truly be a magnificent spectacle (壯觀). Starting from the next issue (來號), following the scenery and seasons, we will strive to introduce the scenery, so please look forward to it eagerly.

▲Also, as announced separately (別紙豫告), our company has started a publishing business as well (지). The main purpose is the publication of good books (良書刊行) and providing them at actual cost (實費提供). Please order many with absolute (絶對) peace of mind.

▲Right now, it is the extreme heat (酷暑) of ninety-five or six degrees [Fahrenheit], but by the time this book (冊) reaches the world, it will probably be early autumn, a good season for reading (初秋好讀書季節). Reading under the lamp is enjoyable (燈下에 讀書可親). Please read it fondly (愛讀).

▲We are grateful for the complete sell-out (賣盡) of the inaugural issue (創刊號), and although the August issue was skipped (缺하엿스나) due to midsummer (盛夏), from now on we will publish monthly (每月發刊), so please be aware of this. (P'ain) <53>

**Summary**

This editorial postscript from the September 1929 issue of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine apologizes for delayed or omitted content, including an overview of contemporary thinkers and literary figures, novels, and essays, citing lack of preparation and "censorship-related matters" (敬關係). It highlights the current issue's theme on modern "pioneers" and promotes future features like the "Eight Views of the Peninsula" illustrated by top artists and the magazine's new publishing venture offering books at cost. It notes the sell-out of the first issue and confirms monthly publication going forward, despite skipping the August issue. For historians, the direct mention of delays due to "敬關係" offers a glimpse into the pressures of censorship faced by Korean publications under Japanese colonial rule. The promotion of "pioneers" and a "civilization critique" based on their achievements, along with the ambitious plan for the "Eight Views of the Peninsula," reflects cultural nationalist aspirations and efforts to define and celebrate Korean identity and heritage within the constraints of the colonial period.
