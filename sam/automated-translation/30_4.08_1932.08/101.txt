Samch'ŏlli Company (三千里社) Business Bureau <43>

**Summary**

This is a brief company notice (社告) from the Samch'ŏlli Company's Business Bureau, published in the August 1, 1932 issue of Samch'ŏlli magazine. It announces recruitment for branch offices (支社) throughout Korea (海內) and internationally (海外), urging readers to establish one if their region lacks one. The notice also mentions that internal regulations (內規) will be provided. From a historical perspective, this notice highlights the ambition and reach of a Korean cultural enterprise like the Samch'ŏlli magazine during the colonial period, seeking expansion not just within the peninsula but also targeting the Korean diaspora or markets overseas. It reflects an active attempt at commercial and organizational expansion despite the constraints of colonial rule.
