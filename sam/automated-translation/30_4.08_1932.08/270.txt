Life in the Servants' Quarters
						By Sohyang Ch'oe Mun-jin

Like a crab shell, the snail's house, seeming about to collapse, teeters precariously,
In a single room the size of a palm, thirteen family members huddle together,
Sitting, foreheads touch; standing, heights are constrained.

My son, if this were my house, it would exceed my station,
But going from house to house, door to door, is my fate of living in servants' quarters (행낭사리),
If even this house is taken, I'll sleep under a straw mat on the street.

Though lacking rice and money, sons and daughters are plentiful,
The baby held in mother's arms is quieted from crying by the breast (젖고지),
The children, jealous over food (섬차리는), fight whenever they see rice.

The tantrum-throwing young master of the main house causes trouble constantly,
His belly full from eating rice, he whines, demanding rice cakes,
Given rice cakes, he demands candy, bursting into forced tears.

Amidst the bursting forced tears, the servant's child gets to live,
Leftover grains of rice (발알), leftover chewed pieces of rice cake remain,
The cries of gnawing hunger are cut off by a lump of rice cake (떡뎅이).

The smaller child, seizing the chance, gobbles it down thoughtlessly in large chunks (뭉턱뭉턱),
The older child, unable to just watch, swallows only saliva (춤만꿀떡),
After threats and coaxing, he glares and lunges.

The smaller child, unwilling to give it up, whines and throws a tantrum (앙탈쓰나),
But in those starved intestines, even sibling ties (동기) are unrecognized,
The snatched rice cake is greedily devoured (넝큼넝큼), soon gone, gobble gobble.

The crying sound that had stopped makes the servant's room tremble, tremble,
The scolding roar (훗통소리) from the mistress of the inner house silences the weeping,
Even the whining young master joins in with curses.

All day long, a whiner; all day long, a crybaby (우룸구럭이),
Before the tear-marks from crying and whining have even dried,
Forgetting his own faults, his mouth alone is sharp.

At the end of the servant child's crying, the mother's scolding follows,
Though she nods off drowsily (군들군들) during harsh and strenuous work,
Accusations of being a late sleeper, a daytime napper, all sorts of faults emerge.

Even if she breaks a dish while washing up, she's scolded for being angry,
Even if the cooking rice scorches, she's yelled at for carelessness,
Even if the boiling stew overflows, she's blamed for being slow-handed.

If she speaks loudly, she's faulted for bad manners,
If she doesn't answer a guest, they shriek that she's sullen,
Even if she soothes a crying child, they get angry that she isn't soothing it.

The wooden floor polished every morning shines like a mirror (경울), spotlessly,
Not a single speck of dirt can be seen, not a mote of dust settles,
Yet she's reprimanded for flaws, ordered about for being lazy.

Washing clothes every other day, the backs of her hands are all cracked,
Attending to everything in the kitchen (붓도막) and all sorts of errands (온갓시중), she can't even rest her back once,
The times she nods off with eyes open happen several times a day.<97>

**Summary**

This poem vividly portrays the destitute and difficult life of a servant family residing in the *haengnangch'ae*, the outer servants' quarters of a wealthy Korean household in 1932. It details their cramped living space, constant hunger, the stark contrast between the servants' children and the spoiled child of the main house, and the relentless verbal abuse and scrutiny endured by the servant mother from her employers. The poem highlights the extreme poverty, social hierarchy, and harsh realities faced by the lower classes in colonial Korea. Historians might find the poem's depiction of servant life, the specific vocabulary of the era related to daily life and social interactions (like *haengnangsari*, *urumgurŏgi*, *hutt'ongsori*), and the raw portrayal of class conflict and economic hardship valuable for understanding social conditions during that period.

행낭사리
						素香 崔文鎭
게딱지같은 달팽이집 쓸어질듯 곤들곤들
손바닥한 한칸방에 열세식구 오글오글
앉으면 이마좇고 서면은 키절인다.

이남아 내집이라면 내분수가 과하지만
이집저집 문간마다 행낭사리 내신세라
이집조차 더난다면 행길우에 거적삼 잔다.

쌀과 돈은 없을망정 아들딸은 수북수북
어미품에 앤긴애기 젖고지로 우룸달랜다
섬차리는 아해들은 밥만보면 싸홈질이다.

떼잘쓰는 안방도령님 때마다 말성거리
밥먹다 부른배에 떡달라고 트집이며
떡을주면 사탕달라 생우룸이 터진다.

생우룸 터지는 판에 행낭아해 살고난다
먹다흘린 발알이 남아 씹다남은 떡이 남아
배고른 허기찬우룸 떡뎅이로 끈처진다.

작은놈은 좋은김에 넉없이 뭉턱뭉턱
큰놈은 바라다못해 춤만꿀떡 삼켜가며
으르며 달래던끝에 눈흘기며 덤벼든다.

작은놈은 않줄려고 우룸우룸 앙탈쓰나
굶주린 그창자에 동귀조차 몰라볼세
빼아슨떡 넝큼넝큼 어느듯 우물우물.

끈첫던 우룸소리 행낭방이 움씰움씰
안댁마나님 훗통소리 울던우룸 자저질세
트집쟁이 도련님도 덩다러서 욕설이라.

왼종일 트집쟁이 하로종일 우룸구럭이
울던눈에 맺진트집이 아즉도 마르기전에
제흉은 어데두고 주둥이만 여물엇다.

행낭아해 우룸끝에 어멈구박 도나온다
모질고 힘찬일에 군들군들 선잠자도
늦잠쟁이 낮잠쟁이 온갓흉이 다나온다.

설거질하다 그릇마저도 화낸다고 흉을보며
짓던밥이 누르러도 조심없다 야단이며
끌른찌게 넘처와도 손더듸다 책망이라.

말소리 높이해도 버릇없다 책잡으며
손님대답 않아해도 앙쿰하다 악을쓰며
우는아해 달래여도 안달랜다 역증낸다.

아츰마다 닥는마루 경울같이 얼룽얼룽
틔하나 볼수없고 몬지하나 안앉어도
덜흠치다 곡잡으며 겨으르다 호령이라.

하로건네로 빠는빨래 손등사리 다터지고
붓도막에 온갓시중 허리한번 못쉬일세
눈뜨고 조은는때가 하로에도 몇번이라＜97＞
