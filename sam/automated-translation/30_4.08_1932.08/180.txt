Author: Not specified
Article Type: 잡저 (Miscellaneous Writing)

Father—Well, where could there be such a perplexing situation? In any case, that man should take responsibility for the newborn baby, but if he doesn't accept responsibility, where could there be a bigger problem than this?

Daughter—Don't worry about that. I don't really know who that baby's father is either... because there are three or four candidates.<69>

**Summary**

This short piece presents a dialogue between a father concerned about his daughter having a child out of wedlock and the potential father refusing responsibility, and the daughter who nonchalantly reveals she doesn't know who the father is because there were several possibilities. The "double difficulty" of the title refers first to the illegitimate child and the father's potential refusal, and second, unexpectedly, to the daughter's uncertainty about the father's identity. For historians, this brief text, likely intended as social satire or humor within the "Miscellaneous Writing" category, offers a glimpse into social commentary regarding changing sexual mores, illegitimacy, and perhaps anxieties about modern female behavior in colonial Korea as perceived or portrayed in popular media of the time.
