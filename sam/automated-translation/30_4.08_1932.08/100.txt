따리겟다 (I'll pick it / Titbits / Anecdotes)

Ok-hŭi (玉姬): "No matter how much Napoleon boasts to the world, even he had no choice but to take off his hat in front of that person!"
Ch'ae-sun (彩順): "Wow, really? Napoleon took off his hat? Then that person must be quite formidable. Who on earth is it?"
Ok-hŭi (玉姬): "Heh, a barber (리발쟁이야)."

***

그러키 때문에 (That's Why)

Pastor (牧師)—Liquor is your enemy, no, the enemy of all humankind.
Drunkard (醉漢)—What are you saying? Isn't it in the Bible (聖經)? Love your enemy. <42>

***

요것 妙하구료 (This is Clever)

Wife (妻): "Honey, you were talking in your sleep yesterday."
Husband (夫): "Really? What did I say?"
Wife (妻): "Loudly, 'Truly, Miss Chuk-hŭi (竹姬)! Miss Chuk-hŭi (竹姬)!' a couple of times—Oh, I don't know! Miss Kyŏng-hŭi (慶姬) is your secret, right?" <42>
Husband (夫): "Hey, don't make such a fuss. That's funny, but Chuk-hŭi (竹姬) is the name of my friend's female puppy (암강아지)."

A few days later, the husband returns from the company. "Did anyone look for me?"
Wife (妻): "Um, nobody came. But the female puppy (암강아지) from your friend's house you mentioned earlier called on the phone."

그럴걸 (That Would Happen)

During Arithmetic (算術) class, the teacher asks, "Alright, listen up. If father gives mother 10 won, and then takes back 8 won and 50 jeon from that, what would happen, Sam-dŭk (三得)?" After thinking for a moment, he jumps up.
Sam-dŭk (三得): "Mom would definitely grab Dad and toss him out (집어 팡게치죠)!" <43>
<42-43>

**Summary**

This article presents four short humorous anecdotes typical of magazine filler content from the era. The jokes rely on wordplay, misunderstandings, and stereotypical situations: Napoleon bowing to a barber, a drunkard justifying drinking using the Bible, a husband caught seemingly talking about another woman in his sleep who claims it's a dog's name (only for the "dog" to supposedly call later), and a child's literal and violent interpretation of a math problem involving money exchange between parents. These snippets offer a glimpse into popular humor, common social interactions (husband-wife dynamics, teacher-student), and everyday language use (including older spellings) in 1930s Korea. Historians might find the humor revealing about social norms, gender roles (the suspicious wife, the father controlling money), attitudes towards authority (pastor, teacher), and the linguistic landscape of the time.
