追憶
						李秉岐
Holding farming tools (광이) in one hand and a brush in the other,
Have I not lived these thirty-two years fighting solely against hardship?

Having become a lonely body, I trusted differently than others;
You who came after me, why do you go ahead of him? With whom shall I now share this sorrow of mine?

The mountain ridge is hazy, the evening sun casts its light. The white sand is frosted, the pine needles are blue,
In that place, do you lie alone in deep sleep?

Your wife and son, your aged mother,
And also the sorrow you could not resolve in this world—how could your body lying in the Yellow Springs (黃泉) forget?

Alone at one side of the desk, leaning slantwise,
Whenever I try to leaf through the bloodstains and red flames (血痕과 紅熖), in newly surging longing, I cannot bear it. <91>

**Summary**

This piece is a short, melancholic poem by Yi Pyŏnggi titled "Recollection." The author laments the premature death of a younger contemporary or friend ("you who came after me"), reflecting on his own life of hardship and his now intensified loneliness. He vividly imagines the deceased lying in their grave, unable to forget the family and unresolved sorrows left behind. The poem concludes with the author's unbearable grief resurfacing whenever he encounters mementos (metaphorically described as "bloodstains and red flames," possibly writings or shared works) of the departed. For historians, this article offers insight into personal expressions of grief and loss published in a major Korean magazine during the colonial period. It showcases lyrical introspection and the enduring power of personal bonds and memory, even amidst the broader political and social context of the time. The metaphorical phrase "bloodstains and red flames" hints at possibly intense shared experiences or writings.

追憶
						李秉岐
한 손에 광이잡고 또 한 손에 붓을 들어
설흔 두 해를 살어예는 그 동안을 오로지 괴로움만으로 싸워올 뿐이 드냐.

외로운 몸이 되어 남달리 믿업더니 내 뒤에 오든 그대 그를 압서 가는고야 다시는 뉘를 다리고 이내 시름 말하리.

山머리 희젓한데 석양은 빛여든다. 하얀 모래서리 솔닢은 파라코나 그 곧에 그대는 홀로 깊이 잠을 드느냐.

안애와 아들이며 늙으신 어머니를 또한 이 세상에 못다푸든 그 슳음을 黃泉에 누운 몸이라도 어이하여 잊으리.

책상 한 머리에 다만 홀로 비겨앉어 血痕과 紅熖을 뒤적어려 볼때마다 새로이 그리운 마음에 내못견대하옵네.＜91＞
