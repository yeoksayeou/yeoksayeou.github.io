Editor's Postscript

○ Sambok, Sambok, Sambok—We send out the August issue amidst this intense heat. We hope this magazine becomes a companion for all of you as you enjoy yourselves by the mountains and waters.

○ Starting from this issue, we have resumed publication after a suspension. We will continue like this until the Newspaper Law comes into effect.

○ The censorship (檢閱) by the Police Affairs Bureau (警務局) for the "Poets' Group Collection" (詩人同人集 - reconstructed) has not yet come through, but we expect it will be published by mid-September. We apologize for making you wait so long. <104>

**Summary**

This editor's postscript from the August 1932 issue of *Samch'ŏlli* informs readers that the magazine is being published despite the summer heat. It notes the resumption of publication after a suspension, linking the current format to the anticipated implementation of the Newspaper Law. It also mentions a delay in the publication of a "Poets' Group Collection" due to pending censorship approval from the Police Affairs Bureau (Kyŏngmuguk), apologizing for the wait. From a historical perspective, the postscript clearly illustrates the operational difficulties faced by Korean publishers under Japanese colonial rule, specifically referencing direct censorship by the Police Affairs Bureau and the looming impact of press laws (Newspaper Law). The mention of suspension and resumption also hints at potential previous censorship issues or financial struggles common during the era.
