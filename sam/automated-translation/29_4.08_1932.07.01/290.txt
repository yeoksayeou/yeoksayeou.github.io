Kim Chŏng-p'il (金貞弼), who once made a name for himself as a "beauty poisoner" (毒殺美人), has already been suffering behind iron bars (鐵窓) for over 10 years. Word is that his conduct (操行) is good, and he is said to have received commendation certificates twice. It is said that receiving it twice is no easy feat. Seeing this, perhaps his sentence might be reduced? From what is heard, there are still 4 years remaining until his release date.

If you go to the two big department stores, Hwasin (和信) or Tong-A (東亞), there is almost nothing lacking, with everything well-equipped, but one regrettable (遺憾) thing is why they do not establish book sections (書籍部). A book section is really necessary; look, don't even Chŏngjaok (丁字屋) and Mitsukoshi Obokchŏm (三越吳服店) both have them?

Why are bells attached for newspaper delivery (新聞配達) within the city (市内)? From now on, if they weren't attached except for extras (號外), we would be less startled.＜11＞

**Summary**

This short article presents three unrelated pieces of social commentary from 1932 Seoul. It notes the continued imprisonment but good behavior of notorious criminal Kim Chŏng-p'il, criticizes the lack of book departments in the Korean-owned Hwasin and Tong-A department stores compared to their Japanese counterparts (Chōjiya and Mitsukoshi), and complains about the noise made by newspaper delivery boys' bells. For historians, the piece offers insights into public consciousness regarding crime, the developing consumer culture and competition between Korean and Japanese businesses in colonial Seoul, and everyday urban annoyances like noise pollution. The comparison between department stores is particularly revealing about perceived differences in service or offerings.

휘파람
毒殺美人으로 一代에 성명을 날니든 金貞弼은 벌서 10有餘年을 鐵窓에서 呻吟하고 잇는데 들니는 말에 操行이 조와서 두 번이나 상장을 탓다고 한다. 두 번 타기가 여간 어려운 일이 아니라는데 이런 것을 보면 혹은 또 减刑이나 되지 안을가 드른즉 아직도 出獄날자가 4個年이 남엇다고 한다.

和信이나 東亞의 두 큰 百貨店에 가면 업는 것이 업스리만치 모든 것이 具備하엇건만 한가지 遺憾은 엇재서 書籍部를 아니둘가. 書籍部는 정말 필요한데 보라구 丁字屋이나 三越吳服店에도 모다 잇지 안는가고-

市內의 新聞配達에 엇재서 방울을 채울가. 이제부터는 號外 이외에는 채우지 말엇스면 덜이나 놀날 것이야.＜11＞
