A Sketch of a Day with Ms. Pak Ho-jin, Recently Released from Prison

The rainy season had ended, but the sky hadn't cleared properly, and the weather was extremely muggy.
It was around two in the afternoon when this reporter visited the Kyŏngsŏng branch of the Kŭnuhoe (槿友會) to meet Ms. Pak Ho-jin (朴昊辰), who had been released from prison a month earlier.

Entering the courtyard, a door that had long been closed was open, and there was a sense that even the air inside the hall had cleared.
As the reporter approached, someone came out from inside the hall to greet me; it was none other than Ms. Pak, whom I was looking for.
She looked much younger and more affectionate than I had imagined.

To the reporter's question, "How much hardship have you endured?", Ms. Pak replied with a smile in her eyes, her speech slightly tinged with a P'yŏngan Province accent,
"What hardship? I just sat quietly inside and came out, what trouble could there have been?"

"Where are you staying now?"
"My house is nearby, but I am staying here."
"Are you handling office work?"
"No. There isn't much work, but these days I spend more time at the hospital because of illness."
"What illness is it? It must be something you contracted there, right?"
"Anyway, I don't know how many illnesses there are. Ear trouble, nose trouble, eye trouble, heart problems, nervous exhaustion... it's become like this. I can't do anything."

"How long were you in prison?"
"I came out after three years."
"You were there for quite a long time."
"Others stay for 10 years, what's so long about mine?"
"Was this your first time?"
"I'd been in detention centers many times, even several times a year, but this was my first time in prison."

"What were your impressions comparing being in a detention center versus prison?"
"There aren't any special impressions, but in the detention center, my mind wasn't calm, I'd prick up my ears hoping to hear some news from the people coming in, and I'd look forward every day wondering when I'd get out. But once you resign yourself to prison time, your mind becomes completely empty, and you just have the thought of living the prison life for a certain period."

"I'd like it if you could tell me in detail what you felt in prison."
"Can I organize it like that right now? I'll tell you slowly."

"Are the systems and facilities the same in men's and women's prisons?"
"I don't know that well. I've never seen a men's prison. They absolutely don't show you."

"What kind of clothes do you wear?"
"While awaiting trial, we wear blue clothes (靑服), but after sentencing, we wear red clothes, a Japanese 'haori'."

"Are female prisoners kept in solitary cells?"
"There are some who are kept in solitary, but they usually put several together in one room."
"Were you in a solitary cell, Ma'am?"
"Yes, I was in solitary."
"In terms of prison life, which is better: being in solitary or being with several people together?"
"I found being alone much better."

"I suppose you have to sit kneeling all day long?"
"That's right, but there's also exercise time once a day, and when the guard isn't looking, it's okay to sit comfortably. But when the guard is watching, you must kneel."

"Can you use the restroom freely? And what about when you want to drink water?"
"It's unrestricted. And they bring water three times a day in a small container, so you can drink if you want."

"When you're sitting alone in your cell, don't you think about the outside world? And about your parents, siblings, friends?"
"Why wouldn't I? There's nothing to do all day, and you often end up repeating the same thought many times. And you keenly wish you could meet even someone you met just once somewhere."

"You must be able to read a lot."
"Yes, you can. In summer, you wake up at five in the morning and go to sleep at half-past eight in the evening, so you can read freely during that time."

"Isn't the feeling different when reading in prison compared to reading at home?"
"The feeling might not be different, but if reading at home, you might waste even a little time, whereas in the cell, you can spend the entire day just reading, so that point is different."

"What kind of books did you read, Ma'am?"
"Until September last year, I could read books freely, but after September, the rules changed, and they only permitted literature-related books. At first, I read economics and sociology, but after September, I read things like collections of literary works."

"They say you studied a lot about literature when you were in Kwangtung (廣東). It seems like it would be good for you to write about your feelings from prison life?"
"I will write about it in the future." Having secured this promise, as I was about to stand up, Ms. Pak kindly told the reporter,
"Next time you visit, please don't come as a reporter, but come as a friend." I left her with a brief reply and stepped out the door. <49>

**Summary**

This 1932 article is an interview with Pak Ho-jin, a female activist recently released after three years in prison during the Japanese colonial period. She discusses the harsh realities of prison life, including the psychological differences between detention and long-term imprisonment, the daily routine, mandatory kneeling, restricted reading materials (shifting from social sciences to only literature after a rule change), and the severe health problems she developed (ear, nose, eye, heart issues, nervous exhaustion). Despite the hardship, she maintains a composed demeanor, contrasting her experience with those serving longer sentences and finding solitary confinement preferable. She expresses a longing for human connection and promises to write about her experiences later. The interview concludes with her requesting the reporter visit next time as a friend, not just for work.

For historians, the article offers a valuable first-hand account of the conditions faced by female political prisoners in colonial Korea. Particularly interesting are the specific details about prison garb (blue pre-trial, red post-sentencing), the mention of censorship restricting reading material primarily to literature after September 1931 (possibly related to the Manchurian Incident and tightening controls), the severe health consequences of imprisonment, and Pak's comparison of detention centers (temporary, uncertain) versus prison (resignation, long-term). Her request for friendship hints at the isolation felt even after release and the desire for genuine connection beyond political roles.

최근 출옥한 朴昊辰 여사, 어느 하로의 스켓취
장마는 끈첫으나 하늘이 맑게 개이지 못하고 日氣는 몹시 무덥든 날이엿다.
기자가 한 달 전에 출옥한 朴昊辰씨를 맛나려 槿友會 京城지회를 차젓을 때는 오후 두 시 쯤이나 되엿다.
마당에 들어서서 오랫동안 닷첫든 문이 열니고 회관 안의 공기좃차 맑어진 감이 잇섯다.
기자가 차즘에 회관 안으로부터 나와 마저주는 이가 잇섯으니 그는 바로 내가 찻는 朴씨엿섯다.
내가 생각햇든 씨보담은 퍽으나 젊고 다정해 보혓다.
「그동안 얼마나 고생하섯슴닛가?」하는 기자의 무름에 씨는 평안도 사투리가 약간 석긴 말세로 눈우슴을 처 가면서 하는 대답이
「뭘요. 가만히 들어 안젓다 나왓는데 무삼 수고가 잇겟슴닛가?」한다.
「지금 어듸 게시지요?」
「우리 집이 요 근방에 잇지만은 뎌는 여기 잇습니다」
「사무를 보심닛가?」
「안이요. 별 사무도 업지만 요새는 병 때문에 병원에 가 잇는 시간이 더 만담니다」
「병은 무슨 병인데 거기서 엇으신 병이겟지요?」
「하여간 몃 가지 병인지 몰으겟서요. 귓병, 코ㅅ병, 눈병, 심장병 신경쇠약 이럿케 되다니. 아모 일도 못함니다」
「감옥에 얼마동안 게섯지요?」
「3년만에 나왓서요」
「퍽 오래 게섯슴니다 그려」
「남들은 한 10년도 잇는데 뭘 오래요」
「금번이 처음이엿든가요?」
「유치장에는 1년에도 몃 번이나 들어갓섯지만은 감옥은 처음이엿서요」
「유치장에 게실 때와 감옥에 게시는 때의 감상이 엇더하십딋가?」
「별 감상이야 잇겟슴닛가만은 유치장에 잇을 때는 맘이 진정되지 안코 들어오는 사람들한태서 행여나 무슨 소식을 드를가 해서 귀를 기우리게 되며 또 언제 나갈가 하고 날마당 바라기나 하지만 감옥에 잇는 때는 에심에 붓흐면 맘이 텅- 노히고 얼마동안 감옥살님을 살니라는 생각을 가지고 잇게 되지요」
「감옥에서 늣긴 바를 자서히 이약이해 주섯으면 하는데요」
「지금 그럿케 조직적으로 하게 되겟슴닛까. 천천히 해 드리지요」
「그런데 男감옥과 女감옥과의 제도라든가 설비 등이 똑갓슴닛가?」
「그것은 잘 몰음니다. 남자 감옥을 구경한 일이 업스닛가. 절대로 보혀주지 안는대요?」
「옷은 엇더케 입슴닛가?」
「미결중에는 靑服을 입으나 구형 밧은 후엔 뻘건 옷을 일본 「하오리」를 입슴니다」
「여죄수들은 독방에 두나요?」
「독방에 두는 사람도 잇기는 하지만 한 방에 여럿을 두더군요」
「선생은 독방에 게섯슴닛가?」
「녜-뎌는 독방에 잇섯슴니다」
「독방에 잇는 것과 한데 여러시 잇는 것과 어느 편이 감방 생활상 나흘가요?」
「뎌는 혼자 잇는 것이 퍼 좃터군요」
「하로종일 무릅을 꿀고 안저 잇을 판이겟슴니다 그려?」
「그러치요만 하로 한 번식 운동하는 시간도 잇고요 또 간수 안 볼때는 편하게 안저도 관게 업지요. 그러나 간수 볼 때만은 꿀고 안저야지요」
「대변이나 소변도 맘대로 할 수 잇스며 혹 물먹고 십흔 때는 엇점닛가?」
「맘대로지요. 그리고 물도 하로 세 번식 조고마한 통에다가 떠서 듸려보내주니까 먹고십흐면 먹슴니다」
「감방에 혼자 안저 게시면 세상 생각이 안나십딋가. 그리고 부모 형뎨 친구 생각도요?」
「웨 안나요. 하로종일 할 일은 업구요 한 가지 생각을 몃 번식 되푸리하는 때가 만케됨니다. 그리고 어듸서 한 번 맛낫든 사람이래도 맛낫스면 하는 생각이 간절하지요」
「독서를 만히 할 수 잇겟슴니다」
「할 수 잇지요. 여름갓흔 때는 아츰 다섯 시에 니러나서 저녁 여듧시 반에 자닛까 그동안은 맘대로 독서할 수 잇지요」
「보통 집에서 읽는 것과 감옥에서 읽는 것과 그 감상이 다르지 안습딋가?」
「감상이야 다르겟슴닛가만 집에 안저 읽는다면 조곰만이라도 시간을 허비하게 되지만 감방에서야 하로종일을 전부 독서만 할 수 잇스닛까 그 점이 다를 뿐이지요」
「선생은 엇던 서적을 읽으섯슴닛가?」
「작년 9월까지는 자유로 책을 읽을 수 잇섯는데 9월 이후로는 규칙이 달너젓다고 문예에 대한 서적만 허락하겟지요. 처음에는 경제학과 사회학을 읽엇는데 9월 이후엔 문학전집 등을 읽엇슴니다」
「선생은 廣東게실 때 문예방면에 대한 것을 만히 연구하섯다는데 감옥생활 하시든 소감 갓흔 것을 쓰시는 것이 조흘 듯 십흔데요?」
「앞으로 쓰겟슴니다」라는 약속을 매저 좃코 이러서라고 할 제 씨는 친절한 어조로 기자에게
다음에 차저줄 때는 기자로써 차저주지 말고 동무로서 차저 달나고 부탁한다. 나는 씨에게 간단한 대답을 남기고 문 밧그로 나와버렷다.＜49＞
