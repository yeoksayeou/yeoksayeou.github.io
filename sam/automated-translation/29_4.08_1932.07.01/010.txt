*Myŏngsa Simni*
Han Yongun

The indigo-blue sea
moves gently.
Returning masts,
fully receiving the cleared rain,
drying the wet sails,
return lightly.

Following the fading clouds,
appearing here and there,
small patches of sea and sky,
how can they be so blue?
Islands far and near, small and large,
where are they trying to fly off to?
Dipping my feet, standing with clothes tucked up,
I cannot chase and catch them<4>

*Nakhwaam*
Yi Kwangsu

When the evening sun slanted on the waters flowing down the Sabi River,
amidst flying willow blossoms, they call it Nakhwaam (Rock of Falling Flowers).
Though unknowing children just play their flutes,
it tears at the heartstrings of a thoughtful traveler.
Nakhwaam, Nakhwaam, why are you silent?

On the ancient site of Puyŏ Fortress, descending through seven hundred years,
the spring grasses are green just like in old times.
Where is the site where the resplendent nine-layered palace stood?
Where the noble body of the Son of Heaven (萬乘) went, I do not know.
Nakhwaam, Nakhwaam, why are you silent?

One night, the sound of horses was heard in the waterway;
where did the flower-like court ladies go?
Clutching the silk skirts given by their lord to their breasts,
did they throw themselves into the deep waters of the Sabi River?
Nakhwaam, Nakhwaam, why are you silent?<5>

**Summary**

This article presents two poems under the collective title "Sound of Water, Sound of Wind from Green Waters and Blue Mountains." Han Yongun's "Myŏngsa Simni" depicts a serene and beautiful coastal scene with gentle seas, returning boats, and blue skies dotted with islands. Yi Kwangsu's "Nakhwaam" reflects melancholically on the historical tragedy associated with Nakhwaam Rock at the Sabi River, lamenting the fall of the Paekche kingdom and the fate of its court ladies, contrasting the enduring nature with lost human history. From a historical perspective, Yi Kwangsu's poem, invoking the fall of a Korean kingdom (Paekche) and questioning the silence of the historical site, could be interpreted as a subtle expression of national sorrow and reflection on loss during the Japanese colonial period, a time when direct expressions of nationalism were suppressed. Han Yongun's poem offers a contrasting, perhaps escapist, focus on natural beauty.

綠水靑山의 水聲·風聲
						韓龍雲, 李光洙
明沙十里
韓龍雲

쪽가치 푸른 바다는
잔잔하게 움직인다
도라오는 돗대들은
개인 빗을 배불리 바더서
저진 돗폭을 쪼이면서
가벼웁게 도라온다

꺼지는 구름을 따러서
여긔저긔 나타나는
조금만씩한 바다 하늘은
엇지도 그리 푸르냐
멀고 가갑고 적고 큰 섬(島)들은
어데로 나러가랴느냐
발 적여 드듸며 옷독 서서
쫏처 삽을 수가 업고나＜4＞

落花岩
李光洙

泗泚水 나리는 물에 석양이 빗길 제
버들 꼿 날니는데 落花岩이란다
모르난 아희들은 피리만 불건만
맘 잇는 나그내의 창자을 끗노라
落花岩 落花岩 웨 말이 업느냐

칠백년 나려오든 扶餘城 녯터에
봄 맛난 풀은 풀은 녯갓치 푸럿네
구중의 빗난 궁궐 잇던 터 어대며
萬乘의 귀하신 몸 가신 곳 몰나라
落花岩 落花岩 웨 말이 업느냐

엇던 밤 물길 속에 말 소래 나드니
꼿 갓흔 궁녀들이 어대로 갓느냐
님 주신 비단치마 가슴에 안고서
泗泚水 깁흔 물에 던진단 말이냐
落花岩 落花岩 웨 말이 업느냐＜5＞
