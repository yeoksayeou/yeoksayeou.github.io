綠蔭
						金承鉉

Following the evening sun under the green shade, I went seeking the sea,
It was the Yellow Sea (黃海) where we sang in those old days.
Over ten *ri* of bright sand (明沙十里), rugosa roses are blooming,
And over the pearl-like blue waves (蒼波), white gulls (白鳩) fly fluttering—
Is this not the world of peace, I wonder?

Over the vast blue waves (萬頃蒼波), quietly it is heard:
The boatman's call seeks peace,
The shepherd boys' fishing song also calls for paradise,
And a pair of white gulls call out.

The evening sun under the green shade is wrapped in peace,
Proclaiming the new life of boatmen and shepherd boys.<39>

**Summary**

This poem by Kim Sŭnghyŏn, titled "Green Shade," describes a serene scene by the Yellow Sea at sunset. The speaker finds solace in the natural beauty – the blooming roses on the sandy beach, the blue waves, the flying white gulls – and the peaceful sounds of a boatman's call and shepherd boys' songs. The poem expresses a deep longing for peace and an idyllic existence, contrasting the tranquility of nature with perhaps the unstated realities of the time. From a historical perspective, the poem's focus on escaping to a peaceful, natural world, specifically mentioning the Yellow Sea and recalling "old days," could be interpreted as a subtle expression of yearning for a lost sense of peace or national identity during the Japanese colonial period. The invocation of simple figures like boatmen and shepherd boys finding a "new life" in this peaceful setting might offer a quiet counterpoint to the imposed modernization and societal changes of the era.

						金承鉉
綠蔭의 夕陽따라 바다를 차저가니
그 넷날 노래부르든 黃海로다
明沙十里 海棠花 피여 잇고
진주 갓흔 蒼波에 白鳩야 펄-펄 날니니
그-平和의 世界가 아닐까 하노라

萬頃蒼波 우으로 고요히 들니다
배사공의 부르지즘은 平和를 차즈며
牧童들의 漁歌도 또한 樂園을 부르
짓는 白鳩의 한 쌍이로다

綠蔭의 夕陽은 平和에 싸이여
배사공 牧童들의 새 삶을 웻치노라＜39＞
