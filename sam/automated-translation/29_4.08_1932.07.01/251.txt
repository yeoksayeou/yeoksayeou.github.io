Urgent Notice to Readers

Due to the midsummer heat, and in the sense of allowing both the readers and the editor(s) to take a vacation, this magazine, which was published twice every month, will be issued only once on the first day of the month for the two months of July and August only. (The price will be 20 jeon each, as it will be a special large issue.)

**Summary**

This notice informs readers of the magazine *Samch'ŏlli* that, due to the summer heat, the publication frequency will be temporarily reduced from twice a month to once a month (on the 1st) for July and August 1932. The price for these single monthly issues will be 20 jeon, justified by them being "special large issues". For historians, this brief notice reflects practical adjustments possibly due to summer breaks common at the time, or potentially hinting at underlying economic pressures faced by publishers during the colonial period, necessitating a temporary scale-back disguised as a vacation measure and compensated by a price increase for supposedly larger issues.
