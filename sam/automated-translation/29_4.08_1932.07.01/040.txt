佳人春秋 (Chronicles of a Belle)

For 7 or 8 years, rumors have swirled about whether she was dead or alive, shrouded in secrecy. Now, I will relate the detailed circumstances surrounding Ms. Yun Simdŏk. The story that Ms. Yun Simdŏk is alive in Italy (伊太利) is a blatant lie; it is certain that she committed a love suicide (情死) by throwing herself into the Hyŏnhae Sea (玄海) with Mr. Kim Ujin at that time.

It is said that Ms. Yun Simdŏk was originally the daughter of some kisaeng in P'yŏngyang. That kisaeng, at her wits' end, tearfully abandoned the newborn baby among the pine trees behind the estate of a certain wealthy family living in her village. Hearing the baby's cries, people from that house rushed out, took in this female infant who was barely a month old, cherished her like their own child, and raised her until she was over 20. It is said that the person who took her in and raised her like a biological parent was none other than the mother of Mr. Yun Sŏngdŏk. That is how Ms. Yun Simdŏk and Mr. Yun Sŏngdŏk became siblings, they say.

While in Tokyo (東京), she became acquainted with Mr. Kim Ujin, the eldest son of a wealthy family from Mokp'o, South Chŏlla Province, who was majoring in playwriting, and thereafter they became passionately involved. It's said that her reasons for quitting her position as a music professor at Ewha Womans Professional School (梨專) and appearing as an actress in the T'owŏrhoe (土月會) theatre troupe were to lay the groundwork for when Mr. Kim Ujin would graduate and initiate a new theatre movement. After being the lover of a certain wealthy man, Mr. Yi (李某), from outside the East Gate (동대문) for three days, she went to Harbin (合爾賓), then went to Tongnae Hot Springs (동래온천) with another Mr. So-and-so, and then went back to Tokyo... In any case, after enduring many turbulent changes, she found her eternal burial (永葬) in the blue waters of the Hyŏnhae Strait (玄海灘). During his lifetime, Mr. Kim Ujin had also told his sole close friend, Mr. Hong Haesŏng, that he intended to go to Italy, but that too failed to materialize.

There is a big secret here. It is that Ms. Yun Simdŏk already had an incurable X-disease (X병) at that time and was greatly distressed, and Mr. Kim, too, had some unfortunate illness and was constantly worried. In other words, although the ridicule of the world might have dealt a blow, it is said that illness caused the two to depart for heaven too soon.
In any case, please believe that the theory of her survival in Italy is entirely a false rumor (虛傳).

Update on Ms. Yi Ŭisun

Ms. Yi Ŭisun, the daughter of Yi Tonghwi, who had been staying in Shanghai (上海) with her husband, is said to have gone to Siberia (西伯利亞) some time ago to seek out her father. According to rumors, her father, Yi Tonghwi, while attending to other matters, is serving as the principal of some elementary school and recuperating while looking after his young children.

**Summary**

This article debunks rumors that the famous singer Yun Simdŏk was still alive in Italy, confirming she died in a love suicide pact with Kim Ujin in the Hyŏnhae Sea (Genkai Strait). It recounts her alleged origins as the abandoned daughter of a P'yŏngyang kisaeng, raised by the family who found her (making her the adoptive sister of Yun Sŏngdŏk), her relationship with Kim Ujin, and her involvement in the T'owŏrhoe theatre group. The article sensationally claims that both Yun and Kim suffered from incurable diseases ("X-disease" for Yun), suggesting illness, alongside societal pressure, led to their suicide. It also provides a brief update on Yi Ŭisun, daughter of independence leader Yi Tonghwi, stating she traveled from Shanghai to Siberia to find her father, who was reportedly working as a school principal there. For historians, the article offers insight into how sensational news and rumors about public figures were circulated in colonial Korea, the blending of personal tragedy with gossip, the specific (though perhaps speculative) mention of disease as a factor in the famous suicide, and a contemporary update on the location and circumstances of Yi Tonghwi, a significant figure in the independence movement, via his daughter's movements.
