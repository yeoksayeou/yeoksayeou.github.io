Yang Kŭn-hwan's Imminent Release from Prison

Yang Kŭn-hwan (梁槿煥), who has been living behind iron bars for 11 years at Tokyo Prefecture's Ichigaya Prison (東京府 市ケ谷刑務所), is scheduled for release upon completion of his sentence next autumn in August. However, word is that, as shown in the separate document, he has received commendations (賞狀) three times. Receiving three commendations is a rare occurrence, and it raises the possibility that he might be granted parole (假出獄) sooner. It is said that receiving three commendations generally leads to parole. In any case, here are two letters received recently.

To Mr. Kim Tong-hwan (金東煥 氏前),

As the months and years rush endlessly onward from infinity to infinity, and all phenomena change ceaselessly from birth and extinction to birth and extinction, I have been secluded in prison, completely cut off from human society for over ten years, like a horse in its stable or a bird in its cage. What I hear is only the chirping of birds; what I see is only the likes of cats and mice; what I think of in my heart is my hometown.
Though time passes and all things change utterly, what remains unchanged at any time, just as before, is only the longing for righteousness and reverence for benevolence (慕義敬仁). The old poem saying, "Even a caged bird does not forget flying in the sky; even a running horse always thinks of a long road of a thousand *ri*," certainly did not deceive me. The more time passes while I am confined in a prison in a faraway foreign land, the farther the road becomes, the more deeply engraved in my bones and unforgettable is my hometown, and what tears me apart are thoughts of my family. Though heaven and earth are vast, what is unforgettable to me is only my hometown; though humanity is numerous, whom I cannot help but think of are only my own people (同族).
And now, according to what I hear, the world has fallen into the depths of depression, depression, depression (不景氣), and it is said that all humanity is in a near-death state. Hearing this in prison truly makes me feel an even greater severity, like thorns piercing my body (恰も棘が身を刺すが如く - *modified from 隙夙棠身*).
Thus, it makes me think of my brethren who, as dusk falls on a long road, lack lodging in the falling snow and rain, lack food and clothing in hunger and cold, and have no place to work. Among them, what especially makes me shed hidden tears time and again is that my family is poor; above, I have an aged mother in her seventies, and below, a young daughter of fifteen. Leaving their life and death, hunger and cold, entirely to others, I have no place to look after them. As a son, I fail to be a son; as a father, I fail to be a father. Even my own life lacks freedom. Hearing of the world's depression, a true man (大丈夫) should not dwell on such things. Would a tiger trapped in a pit, wagging its tail seeking food, have the leisure to care for its aged mother and young daughter? With a thousand thoughts and ten thousand considerations, I can only gaze towards the western sky and shed hot tears. Then, suddenly, on the second of this month, my close friends Mr. Ch'oe Sŭng-man (崔承萬君), Mr. Chu T'ae-do (朱泰道君), Mr. Hong Sŭng-no (洪承魯君), and Pastor Kim Ŭng-t'ae (牧師 金應泰氏) came for a visit. Meeting face-to-face after a long time, talk of past and present piled up on the table, and when mutual requests filled both our hearts, Rev. Kim kindly (abridged) listened, and I couldn't bear the congratulations, which led me to take up my pen.
My esteemed friend! Though we have never met, I present this letter, trusting you as a comrade (同志) from old times. To be loved and sympathized with by people is the same as being despised by people, and to be hated and rejected by people contains the meaning of being formidable. However, in my current situation, for you and other friends to help accomplish the tasks I should be doing, I must cast aside such thoughts and offer my heartfelt gratitude and hot tears. But one must not forget that a bicycle runs by means of a person, and a person runs by means of a bicycle.
According to Mr. Chu, you insist on publishing my humble work (拙著) "Sahaŭi Kwang" (四海の光 - Light of the Four Seas), which I am overjoyed to hear. However, I have already entrusted it to the president of the Dong-A Ilbo (東亞日報社々長), Mr. Song Chin-u (宋鎭禹氏), asking him to publish it. Although I haven't received any notification, please meet with Mr. Song once, discuss it, and then proceed.
Please revise it well. Please try publishing two versions, one in Japanese and one translated into Korean.
And when published, please send me one copy each of the first, second, and third printings to look at. Also, please ask Mr. Chu to approach Nikkatsu (日活) and try to get it made into a motion picture film.
It may be difficult to speak of great things, but it would make a splendid motion picture. And I want to show it to my mother once, and also let her read the Korean novel version once. I await immediate notification of the publication results.
Please excuse my messy handwriting.

Postscript

My home is at 62-1 Sung'i-dong (崇二洞), Kyŏngsŏng Prefecture (京城府). My elder brother Chin-hwan (鎭煥) is there, and Chŏng-ja (貞子) is there. Mother should also be there. And please give that so-called commendation (賞狀) to Mother. Please show it to Mother to reassure her even a little. Please be sure to write letters in Japanese.
May 9th
Today is my birthday, suddenly overcome with feelings for my flesh and blood.
○
Today is the 9th day of the 5th lunar month, which happens to be my birthday. For the first time in over twenty years, I have noticed my own birthday and am thinking of my parents and siblings. And taking up my pen, I composed a verse:
When will siblings gather before our parents? Birthdays forgotten passed twenty years. Though born of the same womb, thoughts differ; Destinies demand rushing east and west. Among flowers, bees and butterflies dance wildly; In trees, birds sing, each joyful. Birds and butterflies have nests, returning on paired wings; For us humans, when is the day of return?

Yang Kŭn-hwan (梁槿煥)

Whereas you were previously granted two certificates of commendation (賞表), and since then your conduct has been increasingly exemplary, you have diligently applied yourself to work, and your signs of repentance (改悛ノ狀) are remarkable, you are hereby granted one additional certificate of commendation.
May 12, Shōwa 7 (1932)
Warden of Koduge Prison (小管刑務所長) (*See note below*)
Yoshida Ritsu (吉田律)

[*Translator's Note: The commendation is signed by the "Warden of Koduge Prison (小管刑務所長)", although the main text mentions Yang was held at Ichigaya Prison (市ケ谷刑務所). This might indicate a transfer, an administrative connection between the prisons, or potentially an error in the magazine article.*]

◇To Chŏng-ja (貞子ニ寄ス)
From Yang Kŭn-hwan (梁槿煥)

Oh, Chŏng-ja! You must be worrying constantly now, waiting for word from Father. Did the letter Father sent late last month arrive? I received your letter dated March 1st, reading it with tears of both joy and sorrow. And Father is asking for help from all quarters. In the spring of the year before last, a letter from your Uncle (仲伯父) mentioned plans to develop a gold mine (金山) in Sakchu (朔州). Also, Father's dearly beloved younger sister, Pak Sun-ch'ŏn (朴順天), often told me when you were young that she would take responsibility for your education and raise you splendidly. Because of this, Father hadn't given it any thought until now, just assuming that your Uncle and Aunt (叔母樣) would worry about and arrange everything for your advanced schooling expenses (上級學校ノ學資). But seeing your letter, where neither Uncle nor Madam Pak had sent any word about it, I was truly surprised. That things should suddenly turn out this way fills this constrained Father's heart truly with happiness beyond measure, and also infinite joy. It's because your desire to learn burns so passionately and strongly. However, there is no need to worry so much. After you enter school, I will definitely ask Father's friends to help with your school funds (學資金). Mr. Ch'oe Sŭng-man (崔承萬樣) came for a visit on the 16th of this month, and I asked him various things. Even if, unfortunately, you cannot enter school, there is absolutely no need to worry. Next year Father will be getting out, so at that time, whether you like it or not, you must go to school. You wrote in your letter that you will study hard until the very end and become a great person (偉イ人). What kind of person do you mean when you think of a "great person"? Father is certainly not stopping you from wanting to study, but in Father's view, becoming a great person definitely doesn't require things like studying. If you truly want to become a great person, should you find a friend shivering from hunger and cold, take one of your two garments, give it to your friend to wear, and divide your last piece of bread in two to eat with your friend. And if you recall times since being separated from your parents young when you felt fortunate or suffered hardship, don't forget that. If you find a friend in the same situation, suffering after being separated from parents, think of that friend in light of your own fortune and hardship, sympathize, rescue, and help. To put it most aptly, it boils down to this: Live in love and die in love (愛ニ生テ愛ニ死セヨ). This is not to say studying is unnecessary. Jesus said, "Love is God, God is love, God is light, God is faith, God is omnipotent and omniscient." Socrates said, "Goodness is knowledge." <25> Confucius said, "The wise are not perplexed, the benevolent are not anxious, the humble are not fearful." Shakyamuni said, "Wisdom is indeed a sturdy boat to cross the sea of old age, sickness, and death; a sharp axe to fell the tree of worldly desires (煩惱); a good medicine for all the sick; it is also a great bright lamp in the darkness of ignorance (無明暗黑)." Then, without learning, how can one obtain omniscience and realize the truth?
Ah, my beloved daughter! Please study hard. And yet, I earnestly hope and pray that you will not fix your mind on just one country or one people like your father, but that your compassion will extend broadly to all humanity and all living beings. If you cannot become the world's greatest person, then please become the world's worst person. Father greatly dislikes those who are half-hearted (生々半力 - *likely typo for 生半可, namahanka*), neither great nor bad. Please lean towards one extreme or the other. And in whatever you undertake, become someone who does not fear death, pouring all your energy into tackling and building things up. But after graduating from high school, what do you intend to study? I hear you have talent in singing (唱歌) and drawing (圖畵), so you must advance in whichever direction you like. Father considers making you an aviator, but the thought of my only daughter occasionally falling from an airplane makes me a little apprehensive. However, there was even a time when Father and you had not been born into this world. There is nothing to lose even in death; one merely returns to the origin. Think more about what you want to learn. Father definitely has no intention of forcing you to study something you dislike.

March 28th, Shōwa 7 (1932)
Written by Father Kŭn-hwan

Poem Sent to Chŏng-ja (土韻)

Chŏng-ja, are you well, studying diligently?
Your face and voice fading, long separated.
Place of food, clothing, shelter, for so long,
In darkness, hunger and cold unbearable endured.

Don't resent a father's heart seemingly unfeeling,
Thinking of you, intestines twist, head always bowed.
Do I not first think of what's in your heart?
(abridged)

My body bears ten thousand worries unsparingly,
Alas, what fault have the old and young?
Heaven and earth dark, thoughts newly arise,
Sun and moon lightless, heart reaches to the past.

Chŏng-ja, wait just three more years,
If life permits reunion, we'll speak of aspirations.
Grandmother aged, standing in Father's stead,
Heed teacher's instruction, uncle's counsel, even better.

One writing, three sighs; rewriting, thoughts linger,
Finally re-reading, tears streak the face.
How can a true man's tears fall lightly?
Heaven's partiality, cutting off pity, hard to grasp.

Postscript

Yang Kŭn-hwan's (梁槿煥) work "Sahaŭi Kwang" (｢四海의光｣ - Light of the Four Seas) is good for anyone to read for various reasons, and it is said it will likely be published soon. <26>
<25-26>

**Summary**

This 1932 article from the magazine *Samch'ŏlli* reports on Yang Kŭn-hwan, a Korean imprisoned in Japan for 11 years, nearing the end of his sentence. It highlights his potential for early parole due to receiving three commendations for good behavior. The core of the article consists of two letters from Yang: one to Kim Tong-hwan discussing his life in prison, longing for home, family worries exacerbated by the Great Depression, and arrangements for publishing his manuscript "Sahaŭi Kwang"; the second is a poignant letter to his daughter Chŏng-ja, expressing paternal love, concern for her education, and offering philosophical advice on becoming a "great person" through compassion and decisive action, rather than mere study or half-measures. He encourages her to study but hopes she extends her love beyond national boundaries.

From a historical perspective, the article offers valuable insights into the experiences of long-term Korean political prisoners under Japanese colonial rule. It reveals the psychological toll of imprisonment, the importance of communication (despite constraints, like needing letters in Japanese), reliance on networks of friends and family for support (including attempts to publish works from prison), and personal reflections blending nationalist sentiments (concern for "my own people") with broader humanitarian ideals. Yang's advice to his daughter, particularly the tension between personal ambition, national identity, and universal compassion, reflects the complex ideological landscape navigated by Koreans during this period. The mention of the Great Depression's impact even within prison walls underscores the era's pervasive hardship.

不遠出監의 梁槿煥
東京府 市ケ谷刑務所에서 11個年間을 鐵窓生活을 하고 잇든 梁槿煥은 明秋 8월이면 滿期出獄이 되지만 듯건대 그는 別紙와 如히 賞狀을 세 번이나 탓다고 함니다. 賞狀을 세 번이나 탓다함은 稀有의 사실로 혹은 假出獄이 速히 되지 안을는지요. 賞狀을 세 번만 타면 대개는 假出獄이 된다고 함니다. 좌우간 近日나온 편지 두 장을 記載함니다.

金東煥 氏前

無限から無限へ駸々と進む歲月に生滅より生滅へ轉々と變り行く、萬象の裏に恰も櫪中の馬の如く籠中の鳥雀の樣に十有餘年間を人世より全く隔離される牢獄に幽閉されるや、耳に聞ゆるものは只だ鳥雀の聲目に見ゆるものは只猫鼠の類胸中に考へるものは故鄕の心である、
時は去つても萬象が變り果てる何時何ん時でも俯舊前として變らざるは慕義敬仁の念只だあるのみである籠鳥と雖も空中を飛び忘れず 走る馬と雖も常に千里を長道を思ふと言ふ古人の詩句は決して我を欺かなかつた。余が萬里他鄕の牢獄に幽閉されて時が立てば立つ程道が遠ければ遠くなる程骨髓に銘じて忘れざるは故鄕であり、膓を斷たすものは家族である、天地は廣いと雖も余が忘れ難きは只だ余の故鄕であり、人類は多いと雖も余が思ひざるを得ないのは只だ我が同族である。
そして猶聞く所によれば世は今や不景氣不景氣不景氣のどん底に陷り人類擧つて瀕死の狀態と言ふ、隙夙棠身を刺が如く獄中てそれを聞くは實に一層の深刻さを覺はしむるのである。
さらば日暮れて路遠く雪雨降りて宿は飢へ寒さに衣食なく働く塲所なき我が兄弟等を思はしむるものである、就中、尢も余をして數々暗淚を落さすは余は家貧にして上に七旬の老母あり、下に十五の幼女あり、生死飢寒を却て他に任かせて顧る所なく、人の子として子たらず、人の父として父たらず、自己猶生あり自由なき有樣である、世の不景氣を聞き大丈夫何ぞそれを思ふべき所でないものである、陷井の虎尾を掉つて食を求むものみ豈に老母幼女を顧るの隙があるであらう千思萬度計量を以て只西天を望んで熱淚を灑づ所に去る二日の日に忽然として親友崔承萬君、朱泰道君、洪承魯君及び牧師金應泰氏が面會來るので久ぶりて相面して徃說來話は卓上に積し彼托我願は兩心に滿つる節に金公よく(畧)聞き慶賀に堪へず遂ひ筆を取らせたわけである。
合ふ貴下よ! 未だ一面識なく書を呈す、然し古より同志を以て余は信じてこれを呈す人に愛され同情されると言ふ事は卽ち人に輕蔑されると言ふ事は同一であり人ににくまれし排斥されると言ふ事は卽ち不敵の意を含むのであるが然し今日余の入塲に余が爲すべき任務を貴下共其他の友が助力して果して下さることは如上の樣な意を棄て滿腔の感謝と熱淚を獻けなくではならない然し自轉車は人に由つて走り人は自轉車に由つて走らしむる事を忘れてはならない、
朱君の話に由れば拙著｢四海の光｣を貴下が是非發行すると云ふが何よりも喜ばしく思ふ然し旣に私より東亞日報社々長宋鎭禹氏に托して發行して吳れて賴んでありますが何とも通知が來ないと雖へとも一度宋樣と逢つて相談の上にやつて下さい、
よく訂正して下さい、日文のものと鮮文に譯したのと二た通り發行して見て下さい、
而して發行したら第一、第二、第三を各一冊つゝ私に送つて見せて見せて下さい而して朱君に賴んで日活に誘つて活動寫眞のフイルム吙き込む樣にして居れと云つて下さい、
大き事は言へ難きなれど立派な活動寫眞になるでせうそして家母に一度見せてやり、又鮮文の小說は一度讀まして上げだいのです。發行の結果如何を卽時お知らせる樣に待つ居ります。
亂筆を御容し下さい
