Dr. Yi and President Song

Years ago, when Mr. Song Chinu (宋鎭禹), president of the *Tonga Ilbo* (東亞日報), went to Hawaiʻi (布哇) for the Pacific Conference (太平洋會議), he met a certain famous foreign politician. During their meeting, that politician asked,
"What is the circulation of the *Tonga Ilbo*?"

Although it was a fact as clear as the blue sky that the *Tonga Ilbo*'s circulation was, one way or another, below 99,999 copies, in order to show the spirit of a Korean, he replied,
"Yes, currently 100,000 copies are distributed."

It was true that there was an exaggeration of more than one copy in Mr. Song's words. After the meeting, upon coming out to a separate room, Dr. Yi Sŭngman (李承晩), who had been present at the meeting, raised his voice, saying,
"Look here, Mr. Song! Why couldn't you say it was around 500,000 copies? Those people know that 20 million people live in Korea (朝鮮) and that there are only 2 or 3 central newspapers. So, for 20 million people, there are merely 100,000 readers? Where is there such shame?"

After that, the rumor of the *Tonga Ilbo*'s 500,000 circulation was noisily spread and broadcast among Koreans and foreigners in Hawaiʻi (布哇).<65>

**Summary**

This brief anecdote recounts an incident where Song Chinu, president of the *Tonga Ilbo*, exaggerated the newspaper's circulation to 100,000 copies when meeting a foreign politician in Hawaiʻi. Yi Sŭngman later criticized Song for not inflating the number further to 500,000, arguing that the lower figure was shameful given Korea's population of 20 million and few central newspapers. The story highlights the sensitivity surrounding national image and the desire to project strength during the colonial period. For historians, it offers a glimpse into the differing approaches of prominent figures like Song and Yi towards representing Korea abroad and the circulation of information (and potentially propaganda) within the overseas Korean community.
