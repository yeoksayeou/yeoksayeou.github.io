Record of a Visit to Admiral Yi Ch'ungmu's Tomb
						Pak Yun-sŏk

Born as a Korean, not being able to tread遍踏江山 (all rivers and mountains) to visit and view the historical relics and sites of this land's great ancestors, whose memory is renewed, due to lack of time and opportunity, even for those historical remains that have not been preserved, has always been my greatest regret (痛恨事). Now, having received the chance (‘챤스’) through accidental circumstances and the company's (社) directive to head towards the Hoso (湖西) region on the morning of the 17th and view Admiral Yi Ch'ungmu's ancestral home (故土), tomb (墓所), and relics (遺物), I keenly realized that this was not merely a simple mission of paying respects, and my sense of reverence deepened.

Even in this world where the waves (波瀾) of rise and fall (興亡) are uncertain, we remain, and our long (久遠) history of half a myriad years (半萬年) has displayed a uniquely brilliant distinction (燦然한 異彩) in all human history (全人類史上). If there had not been truly great figures (偉大한 人物) and if their great deeds (偉蹟) and legacies (遺訓) had not been recorded in history (史上), what historical facts (史實) could we proudly boast of?

A great man unmatched in a hundred generations (百世) and among tens of millions (幾千萬人)! As I sought the deeply nostalgic ancestral home, historic sites, and ancestral lands (位土) of Admiral Yi Ch'ungmu, revered as the sole, peerless pioneer (先驅者), I learned that, following the changing state of the world (世情), they are not only deteriorating day by day and month by month, failing to be permanently preserved (永久한 保存) and serve as an example of legacy for our people (民衆), but the Admiral's ancestral lands are apparently mortgaged and pawned (抵當典執) into the hands (X手) of a capitalist (資閥) and are likely to face legal disposition (法的 處分) in the not-too-distant future (將來). While endlessly lamenting this unfortunate environment (不遇의 環境), upon hearing this lamentable (痛歎할) news (消息), who among Koreans would not feel indignant (痛憤)? It is not the writer's true intention (本意) to discuss this national shame (民族的 恥辱) and its details (經緯) before the world (天下) and make a sorrowful appeal (呼訴). However, as the mortgage term has expired (抵當期限完了) and the creditor (債權者) has already urged (督促) the debtor (債務者), his descendant (後裔嗣孫), to fulfill the debt (債務履行), if there is no way (道理) to repay (辨償), it seems an unavoidable fact that the bank (銀行) will eventually <71> carry out a legal disposition. Then, how did the Admiral's ancestral lands and historic sites come to be trampled (蹂躪) by a capitalist, and whose fault (허물) is this?

Admiral Ch'ungmu was the only one for all time (千秋萬代), truly the pioneer who crafted the brilliant history of our nation. Nay, I felt anew that it was solely due to his great undertaking (偉大한 事業) that the white-clad populace (白衣民衆) of all humanity was recognized (認知) for its special existence (特殊한 存在) and civilizational value (文明的 價値). Amidst our people (百姓) sluggishly moving (蠕動) in the dimness of tradition (傳統) and inertia (惰性), who else but the Admiral thunderously (轟然히) raised the beacon fire (烽火) and unfolded (展開) the dawning (曙光) light (光明)? Seeking the irreplaceable home soil of Admiral Yi, I left Kyŏngsŏng Station (京城驛) and, a little past noon (午正) that day, alighted at Onyang Station (溫陽驛) on the Kyŏngnam Railway (京南鐵道), which branched off (分岐) the Kyŏngbu Line (京釜線) at Ch'ŏnan Station (天安驛). Guided (引導) by Branch Manager (支局長) Chŏng Chin-gu (鄭鎭九氏), I rented a bicycle (貰自轉車) and rode over the back hill of Onch'ŏn-ri (溫泉里), speeding along the narrow paddy path flooded with spring water (春水) in the nearby Paegam Plain (白岩平野), commonly called (俗稱). Cursed time, insufficient, did not even allow me to leisurely appreciate (賞翫) the tranquil scenery of the farming village I had longed for amidst the dusty clamor of the city.

"Ira! Iso! Iruru! Over there!" Barely hearing the weary songs of the farmers (農夫) plowing the paddies and fields and the croaking of frogs praising (讚揚) summer, I hurried onward, crossing the Paegam stream ('내'), sometimes getting stuck in mud, sometimes wading through water, until I reached the nostalgic 'Paem-bat' (뱀밧) 'Sajŏn' (蛇田 - Snake Field) in Paegam-ri (白岩里), Changgi-myŏn (場崎面 - likely an older name or specific locale within the myŏn), Asan County (牙山郡). It was already almost one o'clock in the afternoon (下午).

Crossing two flat (平坦) hills in one breath and rushing on the bicycle, I washed off the uncontrollably flowing sweat with water from the spring (泉) right in front of the ancestral home (故宅), in the yard of the outer building (舍廊마당). Composing my mind (心神) that surged like the spring, I ascended to the old residence (舊邸) which had experienced (閱歷) the vicissitudes and complications (波瀾曲折) of over 300 years of spring wind and autumn rain (春風秋雨). Indeed, my emotions were boundless (感慨無量). As the Admiral's great achievements (偉業) and ancestral home decline (頹落) and change with this ever-changing (變化無常) era, there is no one proud of it. How could even this writer (筆者), dull of feeling (感覺이 愚鈍한), not shed a tear and feel an intuitive (直覺的) sorrow? I couldn't immediately spot where the ancestral shrine (祠堂) was or where the relics (遺物) were stored (存置). On the grassy field overgrown with spring weeds, even on the visible pillars of the old-style ancestral home's outer building, there was a wooden sign (木板揭示) stating:
"Viewing of Relics Refused" (遺物參觀謝絶)
What could be the reason for this? Having come this far seeking the Admiral's historic sites, I worried I might return empty-handed (虛還) and cowered (옴축징이 - likely dialect for 옴츠리다) several times.

Regardless (如何間), having come this far, I first (于先) met the Admiral's descendant (後裔嗣孫), Mr. Yi Chong-ok (李種玉氏), stated my purpose (用務), offered simple respects (or apologies - 陳謝?), and proceeded to the Admiral's shrine (祠堂), located separately on the back hill (뒷동산). There, I reverently reported with three bows (三拜禮告) and requested to view the relics. Mr. Yi Chong-ok's son (令息), Ŭngnyŏl-kun (應烈君), with a polite (공손한) demeanor, first carefully transported (運搬) the heavy great sword and treasured sword (太刀寶劍), which were beyond his strength, onto a straw mat (돗자리) spread on the grassy ground in front of the shrine. Then, I reverently viewed the jade belt ornament (玉鷺 - likely 玉具), gold-horned belt (金角帶 - likely 金角帶 or similar belt ornament), cloud dragon cup (雲龍盃), the reminiscent draft record of the Imjin War in his own hand (親筆의 壬辰亂草記), and wartime diaries (戰中日記) and letters (書簡) from various years (歷年) like Kap-o (甲午 - 1594), Pyŏngsin (丙申 - 1596), Chŏngyu (丁酉 - 1597), Mujin (戊辰 - error? Should be war years like 己亥?), Imjin (壬辰 - 1592), Kyesa (癸巳 - 1593), etc. As I viewed each item, there wasn't a single one that didn't make me revere (崇仰) the Admiral's great deeds (偉蹟) at that time (當時) anew. On the gleaming blade of the great sword (太刀大寶劍), 6 ch'ŏk (尺) 5 ch'on long and weighing 20 kŭn (斤), an auspicious energy (瑞氣) still seemed undiminished.

In what era and by whose hand was this great sword made (製作)? On the blade, the fearsome phrase:
"One sweep clears away, blood dyes mountains and rivers" (一揮掃蕩血染山河)
And inside the handle when removed, the maker's signature (署名):
"Made in the 4th month of Kap-o (甲午) year by T'aegwiryŏn Yi Mu-saeng" (甲午4月日 造太貴連李茂生作)
How much great light (光明) must this great sword have bestowed upon our ancestors (先代)! Reading a passage (一節) from the deeply nostalgic Imjin War (壬辰亂) and the Admiral's handwritten wartime diary (戰中日記):
9th month, 10th day, Ŭlmi (乙未 - Oct 29, 1595), Morning cloudy (朝陰), Evening clear (晩晴)
At Myosi (卯時 - 5-7 AM), set sail (發船) heading straight for (直指) T'aech'ŏn Sea (態川海). The [Japanese] (削 - original) ships (船) were lined up at sea (列海) as before (依舊). Crossed again (再渡) to lure them out (誘引) but they retreated/feared(?) (却會㤼). Our forces (我師) appeared and disappeared (乍出乍還), but in the end could not capture and annihilate them (終莫捕殲). Deeply vexed, deeply vexed (痛憤痛憤)! At the second watch of the night (夜二更 - 9-11 PM), returned (還則) and anchored (入泊) at Soch'in-p'o (蘇秦浦?) after crossing Yŏngdŭng (永登後涉?) to pass the night (經夜). Then it was Pyŏngsin day (丙申日).<72>
This diary shows how much pain (苦心) he took in naval strategy (參謀), trying with great effort to lure the [Japanese] (削 - original) ships lined up near T'aech'ŏn Sea by appearing and disappearing, yet ultimately failing to capture and annihilate them, leading him to lament "Deeply vexed, deeply vexed."

Time urges onward as if whipping from behind. Below the eastern (東便) slope of the ancestral home, a peony (牧丹) flower blooms with renewed color. The ginkgo tree (銀杏나무), said to have been planted by the Admiral himself over 350 years ago when he established his home in this 'Paem-bat' (蛇田- 白岩里), has already become an old tree (古木), boasting only its green shade (綠陰) each returning spring. Yet, the vitality (精力) of the Admiral's relics (遺物) and spirit (靈魂) weakens and declines (頹衰) differently each year (歲歲不同). What is this? Koreans have not yet perished so nonsensically (터문이도 업시)! Can we not completely preserve (完全히 保存) this historical great deed (歷史的 偉蹟), this ancestral home, these relics, and make them available for viewing (拜觀), as teaching material (敎材) and for scholarly research (學究的 硏究) for later generations (後生) for all time (千秋萬代)? Alas! It is our fault for being inadequate! Our fault for being incompetent (無能)! Our nation's fault for lacking sincerity (誠意)! To whom can we shift (轉嫁) this responsibility (責任)?

This tearful reality! On top of that, like frost added to snow (雪上加霜), the Admiral's ancestral land (位土) is mortgaged to a capitalist and will face legal disposition in the near future. I decided to ask Mr. Yi Chong-ok (李種玉氏), the person directly responsible (直接責任者), about the inside story (裡面) of this national shame (民族的 恥辱事件) and reveal it (披瀝) to the readers (讀者位끠) of "Kŭnyŏk Samch'ŏlli" (槿域三千里 - Land of Hibiscus, Three Thousand Ri, i.e., Korea) who must be curious.
Q - How large are the ancestral lands, what is the principal (元金) mortgaged to the bank, and how much is the current interest (利子)?
A - It was mortgaged (根抵當) to the Hoso Bank (湖西銀行) on August 29, Taishō 14 (大正14年 - 1925). The lands (位土) are about 40 turŏk (斗落), and with interest on the principal of 2,000 Won (圓), it's about 2,400 Won or less (以內).
Q - Then, is it impossible to redeem these lands? Has the clan council (宗中) discussed (協議) any remedial measures (善後策)?
A - We can only wait for the bank's legal disposition. We received demand letters (督促狀) starting last spring, and the clan council did discuss it, but what can be done when the times (世情) are unfavorable? Things don't go as planned (제음대로 아니됩듸다).

Both the questioning reporter (記者) and the responding Admiral's descendant, Mr. Yi Chong-ok, tried to avoid lengthy talk (장황함), and seeing his uneasy (不安) demeanor, the reporter also lost the desire to ask further. Regarding his current living conditions (現在 生活狀態), he said that last year (昨年度), from the aforementioned mortgaged 40 turŏk of land, there was an autumn harvest (秋收) of 39 sŏk (石). But after deducting this and that, with many mouths to feed (食口), he had only 85 Won to get through the entire year, so he is just barely surviving. His son (令息), Kyŏngnyŏl-kun (慶列君 - different spelling from 應烈?), also attended Posŏng High Common School (普成高普校) up to the 2nd year until last year. He managed to eat (糊口) at a relative's house in Kyŏngsŏng (京城), but the cursed money for monthly tuition (月謝金) and school supplies (學用品) blocked his future path (前途). Now, he just stays under his father (父親) Chong-ok's care (膝下), guiding visitors viewing the ancestral relics (遺物拜觀者의 案內) and passing his days in sorrow (悲哀).

Ah! Is there no patron ('파트론') in this endless world? For over 360 days, almost whether it rains or shines, domestic and foreign personages (內外國人士) incessantly (끗임업시) visit this ancestral home, view the relics, and leave. Yet, who among concerned individuals (關心한 人士) cares that the shrine's wall (垣墻) is crumbling (頹落) from rain, or that rats (쥐) have gnawed holes in the most precious (尊貴한) relic, the handwritten wartime diary (親筆의 戰中 日記冊), and that moths are eating the characters (글자에 좀나는 것)? According to Mr. Yi Chong-ok, preserving even these few (멧가지) relics has involved no small amount of difficulties (多難) amidst the changing social conditions (流動한 世態). That they are preserved better than imagined even now is something for which one cannot but express a thread (一縷) of respect (敬意) towards him. The unknowing world (事情몰으는 이 세상) has some misunderstandings (一部誤謬), saying Mr. Yi Chong-ok is a morphine ('모히') addict (中毒者), etc. However, he is not such a base (低劣) person.

Early on, there were temptations (誘惑) using pressure (X力 - likely 壓力 pressure or 惡力 evil power) or money (金力), asking him to exhibit (出品) the Admiral's relics at an exposition (博覽會) or competitive exhibition (共進會), or to place them in a certain museum (博物舘). Yet, he resolutely (斷然) <73> rejected (一蹴) them all, adhering consistently (主義一貫) to the ancestral will/principle (先祖遺志) of "No need for many words" (不要多言). If not for his firm will (意志), what would have happened? Who would dare persist (固執) in calling him a morphine addict? I wish to resolutely obliterate (抹殺) this claim (主張)! For someone claiming to admire (欽仰) the Admiral to use such vulgar (野卑) and insulting words (侮辱的 言辭) against his descendant is rather the act of a person (人間) defiling the Admiral's legacy (遺蹟). If the opportunity (機會) to preserve the Admiral's legacy in a popular (民衆的) manner had been lost, what if those relics – the great sword, the national treasure (民族寶) handwritten diaries, etc. – had already disappeared?

Reading a passage from the Admiral's Veritable Records (實錄): [Beginning omitted - 前略] Kyŏngsang Right Naval Commander (慶尙右水使) Wŏn Kyun (元均), in the fifth month of Imjin (壬辰 - 1592), sent a person (使人) to inform(?) (諂) Yi Sun-sin (李舜臣) and request aid (請援). Sun-sin was holding a great meeting (大會) with his generals (諸將) to discuss strategy (謀). The generals all said (諸將咸曰), "Officials have separate jurisdictions (職者分界). Troops rely on...? We defend our own strength, which is already insufficient; what leisure (何暇) do we have to go to another's aid?" Military official (軍官) Song Hŭi-rip (宋希立) and Nokto Manho (鹿島萬戶 - Commander of Nok Island) Chŏng Un (鄭運) disagreed, saying, "How can there be 'this side' and 'that side' in subduing the [Japanese] (討 - original likely 倭)? Now all garrisons in the Yŏngnam sea region (今嶺海諸鎭) have fallen (皆沒). If we, with one province's forces (我以一道 定師?), endure watching without rescuing (忍視不救), and sit letting the Yŏngnam sea troops (坐使嶺海之兵) be completely lost today (今日盡沒), then how will tomorrow's affairs be handled (明日之事何以處之)?" At this (於是), Yi Sun-sin was greatly pleased (大悅) and shouted sternly (厲聲日), "My setting out is like testing your intentions! In today's matter, there is only advance, no retreat (今日之事有進無退)! Order (敎) that those who say we cannot fight shall be beheaded (斬)!" Thereupon, he set rules (定約束), enforced strict discipline (嚴紀律), and in an instant (一耳爾然?), immediately combined 40 warships (卽合兵船四十艘). He met Kyun at Noryang (露梁). Kyun admired, rejoiced, wept, and thanked him (均欽喜泣謝). Then he advanced to [Tang]p'o ([遂進至]浦). The [Japanese] ((削 - original)) were just disembarking to burn and plunder (方下船焚掠). Suddenly seeing the troops arrive (猝見兵至), they were all greatly alarmed (皆大驚), shouted clamorously (呼噪), boarded their ships, and came out (登船而出). Sun-sin, riding the momentum (乘勢), beat drums and shouted(?) (鼓낙跳 - likely 鼓譟), and burned 30 Japanese ships (焚倭船三十艘). Smoke and flames filled the sky (煙焰漲天). Provisions and arms were captured beyond count (獲粮械以餘計). He also defeated them at Chŏngmi-p'o (赤彌浦?), smashing ten-plus of their ships (碎其船十餘). Reaching Wŏlmyŏng-p'o (月明浦), he heard the [Japanese] ((削 - original)) had captured Kyŏngsŏng (陷京城 - Seoul). Sun-sin faced west and wept bitterly (西向痛哭), then led his troops back to camp (引兵還營). Later, hearing the King's carriage (車駑?) was stationed (駐) in P'yŏngyang (平壤), he began to clap his hands (始撫掌), saying, "Since the Lord Father (君父 - King) is safe, what worry have I (我何憂焉)?" Then he pressed his troops, met Wŏn Kyun, and encountered Japanese troops (遇倭兵) at Sach'ŏn (泗川) [and] Ch'ŏnam (千岩?). Sun-sin raised(?) his warship and boarded first (揚艦先登?), the generals followed (諸將從之). Nokto Manho Chŏng Un (鹿島萬戶鄭運) charged under a tower ship (突入樓船下), cut its anchor cable, and burned it (斬其碇而焚之). All troops vied to advance, defeated them, and smashed ten-plus ships (諸軍爭進破之碎十餘). Sun-sin was hit in the left shoulder by a bullet (左肩中丸), yet still held his bow and directed the battle (猶握弓督戰). After the battle, he probed the wound(?) (戰罷破臂出之 - meaning unclear, maybe 'probed the arm and removed it'), talking and laughing as if nothing happened (談笑若?). The army first learned of it then (軍中始知之), and none were not stirred and impressed (莫不聳動). The next morning (翌朝), he pressed the army to Wŏlmyŏng-p'o (月明浦). [Japanese] ((削 - original)) ships came from the dawn sea (船從曉海), countless flying amidst clouds and mist (雲靄中無數颺來). Sun-sin thought (以爲) that since the [Japanese] ((削 - original)) had come in great numbers (旣大來), he could retreat slightly and observe the situation (可少退觀勢). He waved his troops back (麾其軍退). But then(?) (己而), [Japanese] ((削 - original)) ships gathered like clouds on the great ocean (船雲集大洋). Sun-sin arranged his troops and did not move (整軍不動). He occasionally sent out two or three ships (時出二三船) to alternately test them until sunset (更迭試日暮). Suddenly, the [Japanese] ((削 - original)) rode the tide and advanced (忽乘潮而進). Sun-sin then led his troops and advanced further (遂引兵益進). Previously (先時), Sun-sin had personally made the Turtle Ship (自以造龜船), its advantage (其利)... On the ship's deck (船上鋪) were planks like a turtle's back (板如龜 背). On the back was a narrow cross-shaped path (上十字細路), the rest was lined with iron spikes (餘皆列捕 刀錐 - likely 鐵錐). The front was a dragon head (前龍頭), its mouth a cannon hole (口爲銃穴). The rear was a turtle tail (後爲龜尾), with a cannon hole beneath the tail (尾下有銃穴). Left and right each had six cannon holes (左右各有銃穴六). Our men were hidden below (藏吾其底?). Cannons (鉋 - likely 砲) fired in four directions. It could advance and retreat (進退), move freely, fast like...? (縱橫樓疾如?). During battle, it was covered with woven reeds (於戰時西馬以編茅 - likely 覆蓋以編茅). Making the spikes and swords unseen(?) (使錐 刀不露?). If the [Japanese] ((削 - original)) jumped onto the path (路超登), they fell onto the spikes (則陷于錐于). If surrounded (掩圍則), large cannons (大鉋 - likely 砲) swept all paths (諸路橫行). Amidst the [enemy] ((削 - original) 中 - likely 敵中), our troops suffered no damage (我軍無所損), and wherever they went, the enemy scattered like branches (而所向枝靡 - likely 披靡). [Rest omitted - 下略]
From this text, one can understand the greatness of his wisdom and strategy (知謀). It is said that even the submarine (潛航艇), an elite new invention (精銳新發明) and implement of war (戰具) of today's 20th century (20世紀今日), was his invention (考案) at that time.

Leaving behind Panghwa Mountain (芳華山 - Paegam-ri's back mountain), unchanging in ancient and modern times (古今이 一樣), listening to the song of the cuckoo (布穀鳥) from the forest (숩속) on the front mountain, as if reminiscing (追憶) the Admiral's great deeds, I decided to visit (參拜) the tomb (墓所) in Samgŏ-ri (三巨里 - likely Samgyo-ri?), where the Admiral's body and soul (體魂) reside (奠居). Returning the rented bicycle (貰自轉車) in Onch'ŏn-ri, I took an automobile ('뜨라이부' - drive). Forcing the car through the overflowing water behind(?) Kokkyo Stream (曲橋川 빗뒤에 넘치는 내물), I reached Samgyo-ri (三巧里) in Ŭmbong-myŏn (陰峯面), about 20-odd ri (餘里) from Onch'ŏn-ri. Just as I reached the front of T'ugu Peak ('투구'峯 - Helmet Peak), behind Ŭmbong Common School (陰峯普通學校), a narrow mountain path (山길) led about 10 chō (十町) into the Admiral's tomb site. The tomb shrine building (墓閣) and stone figures (石物) are like those of a famous family's grave site (山所), but without even lush (鬱蒼) trees (樹木), it is utterly desolate (荒漠). Below the tombstone pavilion (墓碑閣), whose gate (?) (校門 - likely 墓門 tomb gate) and walls (壁) are crumbling, I removed my hat (帽子), folded my hands respectfully (供手), reverently recited (敬頌) the epitaph (碑文), proceeded to the tomb mound 20 paces away, bowed three times (三拜), and wandered around, but no matter how closely I looked, it felt like an untended grave. The nine panels of the grave screen stones (墓屛石) also have gaps here and there and look like they will collapse (잡바질 것 갓다) before long.

Is there anything satisfactory (신통한)? Our nation, boasting a half-myriad-year history, how many great men and outstanding figures (偉人傑士) did we have in past generations (先代)? No matter how times and ideologies (時代와 思潮) flow (流動), it is said that pioneers (先驅者) who left great deeds will always be revered (崇仰). Though the Admiral's legacy (遺物) left great contributions (功勳) to our nation and is precious and evokes fresh reminiscence (기괴기괴 - likely 귀하고 귀해 追憶 새롭다), not a single piece of that legacy (遺物) has been completely preserved. A memorial museum (紀念博物舘) is unthinkable even in dreams, and not many items that could be national treasures (民族寶), such as the books (書冊) he studied or the daily necessities (日常用品) from his lifetime (生存時), remain. Thus, today, because there are not a few temptations (誘惑) from all sorts of groups who meaninglessly request to view the relics and engage in words (言辭) and actions (行動) that defile his spirit (精力), even a notice board (揭示板) stating "Viewing of Relics Refused" is attached (부터 잇스니) to his ancestral home. May concerned individuals (뜻잇는 人士) quickly (速히) collect ardent (熱熱한) sincere donations (誠金) to allow these historic sites (遺跡) of the Admiral to be viewed (拜觀) by the people (民衆) and make the past history of this land (江山) shine even more brilliantly (燦然케).

**Summary**

The author, Pak Yun-sŏk, recounts his 1931 pilgrimage to Admiral Yi Sun-sin's ancestral home in Asan and his tomb. He expresses profound sorrow and national shame over the neglected state of these sites and relics, highlighting the deterioration of the buildings, the damage to artifacts like Yi's handwritten diary, and the desolate condition of the tomb. The most alarming issue is the revelation that the Admiral's ancestral lands are mortgaged to Hoso Bank and face imminent foreclosure due to the financial struggles of his descendant, Yi Chong-ok, who lives in poverty despite his lineage. The author contrasts the Admiral's monumental historical significance with the current indifference and incompetence preventing the preservation of his legacy, decrying the lack of national sincerity and calling urgently for public action and donations to save these historic sites. From a colonial history perspective, the article is revealing in its expression of wounded national pride and the tangible consequences of economic hardship under colonial rule affecting even the legacy of Korea's greatest national hero. Historians might find valuable the firsthand account of the site's condition, the details of the descendant's plight, the specific financial threat from a named bank (Hoso Bank), and the author's framing of preservation as a matter of urgent national responsibility and ethnic survival amidst colonial pressures.

李忠武公墓 參拜記
						朴尹錫
朝鮮사람으로 태여나 保存되지 못한 歷史的 遺物이나마 時間과 機會의 許與치 안는 關係로 遍踏江山하야 記憶에 새로운 이 땅의 先代偉人과 遺跡을 探訪拜觀치 못한 것은 平日에 나의 가장 큰 痛恨事이엇다. 이제 偶然한 事情과 社의 指令을 밧고 지난 17일 아츰 湖西를 향하야 李忠武公의 故土와 墓所遺物을 拜觀할 『챤스』를 어든 것은 果然 參拜만의 單純한 使命이 아닌것을 스사로 覺悟할 때에 삼가로운 생각이 더욱 두터워젓다.
興亡의 波瀾이 無常한 이 세상에도 우리들은 남어 잇스며 半萬年의 久遠한 歷史는 全人類史上에 애오라지 燦然한 異彩를 發揮하엿든 것이다. 이 實로 偉大한 人物이 업섯고 偉蹟과 遺訓이 史上에 記錄되지 안헛든들 무엇을 우리는 떠뜻한 史實을 들어 자랑할 수 잇섯스랴!.
百世와 幾千萬人中에 오즉 만치 못한 偉人! 다만 둘도 업다고 하는 先驅者로 崇仰하는 李忠武公의 懷古깁흔 故土와 遺跡, 位土는 變遷되는 世情딸아 나날히 또 다달히 그나마 永久한 保存과 우리 民衆에 遺訓의 標本이 되지 못한 만큼 毁損되어 갈 뿐만아니라 公의 位土는 一個 資閥의 X手에 抵當典執되어 멀지 안흔 將來에는 法的 處分을 當하게 될 모양이라 한다. 이제는 스사로 不遇의 環境임을 끗업시 悲哀하면서도 이 痛歎할 消息을 들을 때에 朝鮮사람이면 누구나 痛憤한 생각을 갓지 안흘 자 잇슬랴! 이 民族的 恥辱과 그 經緯를 天下에 論하야 애달은 事實과 呼訴를 하려는 것도 筆者로서는 本意가 아니다. 그러나 抵當期限完了와 債務者인 그 後裔嗣孫에게 債權者로부터 이미 債務履行을 督促한바 잇다하니 辨償할 道理가 업다면 結局 銀行으로부터＜71＞ 法的 處分을 할 것은 免치 못할 事實일 것이다. 그러면 公의 位土遺跡이 엇지하야 一個資閥의 蹂躪을 當하게 되엇스며 이것은 누구의 허물이라 할가.

忠武公의 千秋萬代에 오즉 한분이엇고 정말 우리 民族의 燦爛한 歷史를 지은 先驅者이다. 아니 全人類의 白衣民衆으로 하여금 特殊한 存在와 文明的 價値를 認知식히엿슴도 오즉 이분의 偉大한 事業이 잇섯기 때문이 아닌가 함을 나는 새삼스러히 늣기엇다. 傳統과 惰性의 희미한 가온데 蠕動하든 우리 百姓들속에서 轟然히 烽火를 들고 曙光빗치는 光明을 展開한것도 公이 아니신들 누가 잇섯슬고 엇질수 업는 李公의 故土를 차저 京城驛을 떠난 當日 午正 좀지나 京釜線天安驛에서 分岐된 京南鐵道溫陽驛에 내리여 支局長 鄭鎭九氏의 引導로 貰自轉車 어더타고 溫泉里 뒤고개를 넘어 附近 俗稱 白岩平野의 春水넘치는 좁다른 논길을 달닌다. 넝늑지 못한 「웬수의 時間은 都市의 紅塵萬丈속에서 그리든 農村의 閑靜한 風景조차 넝늑히 賞翫활게을 주지 안는 것이다.
「이라! 이소! 일루루! 저리로!」 논, 밧, 쟁기질하는 農夫들의 고달푼 노라와 여름을 讚揚하는 개고리 소리 들은듯 만듯 총총히 서들어 白岩 「내」건너 혹은 발빼고 물건너 懷古깁흔 牙山郡場崎面 「뱀밧」 「蛇田- 白岩里」 다다르니 벌서 下午 한시가 거진 되엇다.

平坦한 두고개를 한숨에 넘고 自轉車달니어서 주체할 수 업시 흐르는 땀을 故宅압 바로 舍廊마당에 잇는 「샘」 「泉」 물에서 시츠고 셈가티 솟는 心神을 가다드머 春風秋雨 300餘年의 波瀾曲折을 閱歷한 舊邸에 오르니 果然 感慨無量하다. 變化無常한 이 時代를 딸아 公의 偉業과 故土에는 變遷되고 頹落되어감에 떠뜻한 이 업는지라 이에 엇지 感覺이 愚鈍한 筆者인들 한줄기의 눈물과 直覺的한 끗의 悲哀가 업섯스랴! 祠堂은 어듸메 게시며 遺物은 어느 곳에 存置하엿는지 얼른 發見할 수 업섯다. 봄풀만 가득히 자란 잔듸밧에 녯 形狀의 故宅 舍廊마조 보이는 기동에는
「遺物參觀謝絶」
이라는 木板揭示가 잇스니 이 엇지된 까닭일가! 이곳까지 公의 遺蹟을 차저온 筆者로서 虛還하지나 안흘가하야 스사로 옴축징이 몃번이나 낫다.

如何間 이곳까지 이르럿스니 于先 公의 後裔嗣孫 李種玉氏를 맛나고 用務와 簡單한 陳謝로 뒷동산에 따로 떠러저잇는 公의 祠堂에 일으러 삼가히 三拜禮告하고 遺物의 拜觀을 請하니 李種玉氏 令息 應烈君의 공손한 態度와 힘에 부치는 太刀寶劍먼저 祠堂압 마당 뺑대풀잔듸우에 깔은 돗자리에 삼가 運搬하고 玉鷺 金角帶 雲龍盃 追懷되는 親筆의 壬辰亂草記를 비롯하야 甲午, 丙申, 丁酉, 戊辰, 壬辰, 癸巳等 歷年의 戰中日記等 書簡等 一一히 삼가 拜觀할 때에 어느 것 한가지 當時의 公의 偉蹟을 새삼스럽게 崇仰되지 안는 것이 잇섯다. 길이 6尺5寸20斤의 太刀大寶劍 번적이는 칼날에는 아즉 瑞氣가 살나지지 안헛다.

이 太刀는 어느 時代에 누구의 손으로 製作한 것인고, 칼날에는
一揮掃蕩血染山河
라는 무시무시한 글句와 손잡이 빼이면 그손에는.
『甲午4月日 造太貴連李茂生作』이라는 製作의 署名이 잇스니 이 太刀는 우리의 先代에 얼마마한 偉大한 光明을 주엇스랴! 懷古 더욱 새로운 壬辰亂과 公의 親筆인 戰中日記 一節을 拜讀하면.
9月初10日 乙未 朝陰 晩晴
卯時 (午前6時-8時間) 發船直指態川海則 (削 - 원문) 船依舊列海 再渡誘引却會㤼 我師乍出乍還終莫捕殲 痛憤痛憤  夜二更還則永登後涉蘇秦浦入泊經夜乃丙申日.＜72＞
이라 하섯다. 이 日記는 當時 公의 態川海附近에 列海한 (削 - 원문) 船을 乍出乍還으로 苦心誘導하엿스나 終是 捕殲을 못하야 痛憤痛憤하섯스니 海戰의 參謀에 얼마나 苦心한 것을 알수 잇는 것이다.

時間은 꼭 뒤에서 매질하듯이 催促한다. 故邸宅의 東便언덕알에 牧丹꼿한송이는 더욱 빗이 새롭고 300有50餘年前에 公이 이 「뱀밧」(蛇田- 白岩里)을 터잡으시어 이 집 지으시고 손수 심으시엇다는 銀杏나무는 어느듯 古木이 되엿스되 도라오는 봄마다 오즉 綠陰을 자랑하지만 公의 遺物과 靈魂의 精力은 歲歲不同하게도 頹衰하여가니 이 왼일고! 朝鮮사람은 아즉 터문이도 업시 滅亡되지는 안헛것만 이 歷史的 偉蹟인 이 故土이 遺物을 完全히 保存하고 千秋萬代로 後生에 敎材와 學究的 硏究이며 拜觀을 식힐수 업는가! 슬프다. 우리의 못생긴 탓! 우리의 無能한 탓! 우리 民族의 誠意업는 탓 이 엇지 누구에게 責任을 轉嫁할고.

눈물겨운 이 事實! 그우에도 雪上加霜으로 公의 位土마저 一個資閥에 抵當되어 不遠한 將來에 法的 處分을 바들것이 民族的 恥辱事件의 裡面을 直接責任者인 李種玉氏에 質問하야 「槿域三千里」에 궁금히 넉이시는 讀者位끠 披瀝하기로 한다.
問 - 位土는 얼마이며 銀行에 抵當된 元金과 現在利子는 얼마임니까.
答 - 大正14년8월29일 湖西銀行에 根抵當하엿든 것인데 位土 約40斗落으로 元金2,000圓에 대한 利子까지 約2,400圓以內이지요.
問 - 그러면 이 位土를 물을수가 업스며 或 宗中에서도 善後策을 協議한 일이 잇슴니까.
答 - 오즉 銀行의 法的 處分만 기다릴 뿐이요. 작년봄부터 督促狀을 맛고 宗中에서 協議한 일도 잇섯스나 世情이 떠뜻지 안흔데 무엇한가 제음대로 아니됩듸다.

質問하는 記者나 答辯하는 公의 後裔 李種玉氏는 서로 이약이의 장황함을 避하려고 하며 氏의 不安한 態度에 記者 亦是 뭇고저 하는 말뜻가치 안흔 것이다. 그의 現在 生活狀態는 昨年度 前記抵當된 40斗落의 位土에서 39石의 秋收가 잇섯섯스나 이것저것 除하며 食口만흔데 單85圓으로 一年열두달을 지나가노라니 죽지 못하야 살아가는 중이라하며 그 令息 慶列君도 昨年까지 普成高普校2學年에 在學하다가 밥은 京城市內 親族의 집에서 糊口하나 月謝金과 學用品살 經費 원수가튼 돈이 그를 하야금 前途를 막게하고 지금은 오즉 그 父親 種玉氏膝下에서 先祖의 遺物拜觀者의 案內나 하고 悲哀의 歲月을 보내고 잇다.

아! 끗업는 이 세상 이에 「파트론」이 업는가! 360有餘日을 거이 비가 오나 눈이 오나 內外國人士가 끗임업시 이 故宅을 차저 遺物을 拜觀하고 돌아가는 사람만흐되 祀堂의 垣墻이 비에 頹落되고 遺物中 가장 尊貴한 親筆의 戰中 日記冊를 쥐가 뚤고 가베먹고 글자에 좀나는 것는 關心한 人士 누구이랴! 李種玉氏의 말을 들으면 멧가지 안되는 이 遺物保存에도 流動한 世態딸아 多難한 事가 적지 안헛스되 이제나마 完全히 想像보다 잘 保存한 것만은 氏에 대하야 一縷의 敬意를 表하지 안흘수 업는 것이다. 事情몰으는 이 세상에서는 李種玉氏를 「모히」 中毒者이니 等 一部誤謬도 잇다. 그러나 氏는 그러한 低劣한 분은 아니다.

일즉이 博覽會인지 共進會인지 公의 遺物을 出品하라 또 某博物舘에 갓다두라는 等 X力으로 或은 金力으로 誘惑한 바 잇스되 氏는 「不要多言」이라는 先祖遺志의 主義一貫에서 斷然＜73＞ 一蹴한것도 氏의 굿굿한 意志가 아닌들 엇지 하엿스랴! 누가 氏를 「모히」 中毒者라 固執하는 者 잇스랴! 이 主張은 斷然 抹殺코저 하노라! 公을 欽仰한다는 者로서 自己 어떠한 主張을 세우고저 이와가튼 公의 嗣孫에 野卑한 侮辱的 言辭를 可함이 오히려 公의 遺蹟을 더러피는 人間이 아닐가 하노라. 公의 遺蹟을 民衆的으로 保存할 機會를 엇게 된것도 그 遺物 太刀 民族寶도란 親筆日記等이나마 이미 업서젓든들 엇지하랴!

公의 實錄 一節을 읽으니 前略- 慶尙右水使元均 壬辰五月 使人諂李舜臣 請援舜臣 方大會諸將謀之 諸將咸曰職者分界 兵有信之我守我强 且不足何暇赴他送耶 軍官宋希立 鹿島萬戶鄭運曰不然 討(削 - 원문)寧有彼此道 今嶺海諸鎭 皆沒我以一道 定師忍視不救 坐使嶺海之兵 今日盡沒則明日之事何以處之 於是 李舜臣大悅 厲聲日 我之發門如試公等意斗 今日之事有進無退 敎言不可戰者 斬於是定約束嚴紀律 一耳爾然卽合兵船四十艘 會均於露梁 均欽喜泣謝遂進至浦 (削 - 원문) 方下船焚掠 猝見兵至皆大驚 呼噪 登船而出 舜臣乘勢鼓낙跳 焚倭船三十艘 煙焰漲天獲粮械以餘計又破之 於赤彌浦 碎其船十餘 至月明浦 聞(削 - 원문) 陷京城舜臣 西向痛哭 引兵還營 旣而聞車駑 駐平壤始撫掌 君父旣全我何憂焉 遂迫兵會元均遇倭兵於泗川 千岩 舜臣揚艦先登諸將從之 鹿島萬戶鄭運突入樓船下斬其碇而焚之 諸軍爭進破之碎十餘 舜臣左肩中丸猶握弓督戰 戰罷破臂出之談笑若軍中始知之 莫不聳動 翌朝迫軍月明浦 (削 - 원문) 船從曉海 雲靄中無數颺來舜臣 以爲(削 - 원문)旣大來可少退觀勢 麾其軍退己而(削 - 원문)船雲集大洋 舜臣整軍不動時出二三船  更迭試日暮(削 - 원문)忽乘潮而進舜臣遂引兵益進先時舜臣 自以造龜船其利 船上鋪 板如龜 背上十字細路 餘皆列捕 刀錐前龍頭 口爲銃穴後爲龜尾尾 下有銃穴左右各有銃穴六 藏吾其底 四面放鉋進退 縱橫樓疾如於戰時西馬以編茅使錐 刀不露(削 - 원문)路超登則陷于錐于掩圍則 大鉋諸路橫行(削 - 원문)中 我軍無所損而所向枝靡 (下略 - 원문)
이글에서 知謀의 偉大함과 20世紀今日의 精銳新發明의 戰具인 潛航艇도 當時의 公의 考案이라 한다.
古今이 一樣인 芳華山 (白岩里後便山)을 뒤로 두고 압산의 숩속에서 公의 偉業을 追憶하는 듯한 布穀鳥노래를 들으며 三巨里 公의 體魂이 奠居하신 墓所를 參拜하기로 하엿다. 溫泉里에서 貰自轉車는 돌니주고 自動車『뜨라이부』 曲橋川 빗뒤에 넘치는 내물을 그대로 無理하게 自動車를 물속에 달니어 陰峯面三巧里에 일으니 이곳은 溫泉里에서 약20餘里되는 곳이다. 『투구』峯압을 막 다다르자 陰峯普通學校뒤편으로 좁다른 山길 十町가량 걸어들어면 公의 墓所이니 墓閣이며 石物은 이름난 집 山所가기도 하나 그러나 鬱蒼한 樹木조차 업시 荒漠하기 짝이 업다. 校門과 壁도 헐여가는 墓碑閣알에서 帽子벗고 供手하야 碑文을 敬頌하고 20步되는 墓에 일으러 三拜하고 이리저리 徘徊하며 아모리 살피어도 主人업는 山所갓다. 九片의 墓屛石도 이리저리 틈이 벌어 오래지 안하서 잡바질 것 갓다.

무엇한가지나  신통한 일이 잇스랴! 半萬年歷史을 자랑하는 우리 民族은 先代에 偉人傑士가 몃분이나 잇섯든고! 時代와 思潮는 엇더케 流動한다 할지라도 偉業남긴 先驅者는 언제든지 崇仰할것이라 한다. 公의 遺物이 우리 民族에 남긴 바 功勳이 크고 기괴기괴 追憶 새롭다 할진대 그 遺物한가지 完全한 保存을 한 것이 업다. 紀念博物舘가튼 것은 꿈에도 생각지 못하엿스려니와 그 硏究하든 書冊, 生存時의 日常用品等 한가지도 民族寶될것이 만히 남지 안헛다. 그리하야 오늘날 誘惑하는 모-든 무리를 까닭업시 遺物拜觀을 請하고 그 精力을 더러필 言辭와 行動이 업지 안흠으로 遺物參觀謝絶이라는 揭示板까지 그 故宅에부터 잇스니 뜻잇는 人士誠金의 熱熱한 收合으로라도 速히 公의 遺跡을 이 民衆들에게 拜觀식히고 이 江山의 지나간 歷史를 더욱 燦然케 하소서.
