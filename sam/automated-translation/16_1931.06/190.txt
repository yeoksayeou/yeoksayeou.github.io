**Body Text Translation:**
Marching Song
						Chŏng Chint'ak

Forward! Forward! Forward!
Light up! Our Torches (炬火)
Ring out! Our iron gongs
Hoist! Our banners
Set up! Our Red Flags (紅旗)

Forward! Forward! Forward!
We are an isolated detachment (一支隊), but
We have countless reinforcements (後衛) behind us.<54>

**Summary**

This short, repetitive poem titled "Marching Song" is a powerful call to action. Using imperatives, it urges the lighting of torches, ringing of gongs, hoisting of banners, and setting up of red flags, all under the cry of "Forward!". It acknowledges the current isolation of the group ("an isolated detachment") but asserts confidence in future support ("countless reinforcements"). For historians, the poem is interesting as an example of potentially revolutionary or strongly nationalistic/leftist sentiment appearing in a mainstream Korean magazine during the Japanese colonial period. The use of imagery like torches and red flags, the militant tone, and its publication date (1931) could reflect the influence of international leftist movements (especially given the author is likely the prominent Chinese leftist writer Zheng Zhenduo) or suppressed Korean aspirations. Its presence raises questions about censorship and the circulation of such ideas in colonial Korea.

						鄭振鐸
前進! 前進! 前進!
불켜라. 우리들의 炬火에
울려라. 우리들의 쇠북을
들녀라 우리들의 마치를
세워라 우리들의 紅旗를
前進! 前進! 前進!
우리들은 孤立된 一支隊다, 그러나
우리들에게는 無數한 後衛가 잇다.＜54＞
