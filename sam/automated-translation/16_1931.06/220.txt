**Summary**

This article from the Korean magazine Samch'ŏlli reports the entrance examination questions for Peking University in the spring of 1931. The questions cover sensitive topics for China at the time, including territorial losses over the past century, the definition of a colony, economic damage from foreign powers, and the causes for the loss of Chinese sovereignty. Notably, the exam also included a mandatory military science section with detailed questions on infantry and cavalry roles, unit organization (company, battalion, regiment), formations, artillery duties, target selection, assault preparation, and machine gun tactics. The inclusion of such pointed questions about national humiliation and detailed military knowledge in a university entrance exam highlights the intense atmosphere of nationalism and perceived crisis in Republican China during that period. For historians, these questions offer insight into the political and military concerns shaping Chinese higher education and national consciousness in the face of foreign pressure and internal challenges, contrasting sharply with the educational system imposed in colonial Korea which suppressed such nationalist discourse.
