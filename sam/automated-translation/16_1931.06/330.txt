Gratitude and Apology

Regarding this month's issue's feature on the "Labor-Farmer Union Expansion and Strengthening Movement" (勞農組合擴大强化運動), which is currently the greatest issue, we had to remove parts from the manuscripts of various writers that were difficult to pass censorship (檢閱), resulting in it being somewhat incomplete. Please understand (諒解) that this was unavoidable under the current time and conditions.

July marks the 3rd anniversary of this magazine's founding (本誌創刊). Our editorial department is fully mobilizing and will exert our utmost effort (全心努力) to create a good magazine that you all can truly enjoy reading. If it is one duty to put our full effort into producing a magazine like this under difficult conditions (條件), especially in this hot season, wouldn't it also be a duty for you, esteemed readers (諸氏), to give us twice the love (倍前의 사랑) as before?

Manuscripts completely deleted (全文削除) from this month's issue are:
Secret History of the Discovery of the March First Movement (己未運動의 發覺秘史)... Yu Kwang-yŏl (柳光烈)

Yi Sunsin and the One Chŏn Movement (李舜臣과 一錢運動)... Kim Tong-hwan (金東煥)
And those partially deleted (部分削除) include works by Yi Chŏng-sŏp (李晶燮), Han Chang-gyŏng (韓長庚), and others (其他諸氏).

Regarding this month's special feature on the China problem (中國問題特輯), we were dissatisfied that we could not include much because many articles from overseas (海外) were received after editing due to the pressing deadline (日字促迫). However, in return, next issue's special feature on India (印度特輯) will come out with very substantial content and appearance (充實한 內容外觀).<80>

**Summary**

The editor expresses gratitude to readers and apologizes for the incompleteness of the current issue, particularly the feature on the "Labor-Farmer Union Expansion and Strengthening Movement," due to censorship requirements. They appeal for continued reader support, promising extra effort for the upcoming 3rd-anniversary issue. The editor explicitly lists two articles completely removed due to censorship ("Secret History of the Discovery of the March First Movement" by Yu Kwang-yŏl and "Yi Sunsin and the One Chŏn Movement" by Kim Tong-hwan) and mentions others partially censored. They also note disappointment in the China feature's brevity due to late submissions but promise a substantial India feature next month. This postscript is historically significant for its open admission of censorship under Japanese colonial rule and the naming of specific censored topics and authors, offering insight into the pressures faced by Korean publications and the subjects deemed sensitive by authorities (nationalist history, social movements).
