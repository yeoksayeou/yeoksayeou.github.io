感謝와 謝罪 (Gratitude and Apology)

We are publishing this month's issue while receiving tearful reports (報導) from places like P'yŏngyang and Inch'ŏn. In such times, when the mountains and rivers of the peninsula (半島山河) are shrouded in clouds of sorrow (愁雲), what cause is there for celebration? Therefore, although we had made all sorts of preparations (萬般) to publish a special grand issue commemorating our 3rd anniversary this July as previously announced (豫告), we have unavoidably (不得已) decided to cancel it and instead publish a large special feature (大大的 特輯) in the October issue, with the arrival of the cool autumn air (新入秋凉). Having eagerly planned to celebrate the 3rd anniversary in a big way, we felt that postponing it out of due solemnity (謹愼) would be appropriate at this moment when expressing national condolence (民族的 吊慰) as fellow countrymen (同胞). We sincerely ask for the full understanding (諒解) of our readers.

Furthermore, due to these complicated (錯雜) circumstances (關係), this magazine, which is usually published on the 1st of every month, is slightly delayed (느젓슴니다) this month (이벌달). However, starting next month (來月), we will certainly publish promptly on the 1st day (初1일) again.

It is now summer (녀름), a time when it is easy to suffer from the scorching heat (炎熱) of the three hottest days (三伏). We hope you will cultivate great spirit (覇氣) by enjoying yourselves amidst the great mountains and vast rivers (大山巨河). (P'ain) <92>

**Summary**

The editors express gratitude and apologize to readers for postponing the planned 3rd-anniversary special issue of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine, originally scheduled for July 1931. Citing "tearful reports" from P'yŏngyang and Inch'ŏn and a general atmosphere of sorrow across the Korean peninsula, they deemed celebration inappropriate. Instead, the special issue will be published in October. They also apologize for the slight delay in the July issue's publication due to these circumstances and promise to return to their regular schedule next month, concluding with well wishes for the summer. For historians, this notice vividly reflects the somber mood and likely difficult conditions faced by Koreans under Japanese rule in 1931, forcing even a magazine's anniversary celebration to be deferred out of respect for widespread suffering ("national condolence"). The editors' sensitivity to the "clouds of sorrow" provides insight into the emotional climate of the period.
