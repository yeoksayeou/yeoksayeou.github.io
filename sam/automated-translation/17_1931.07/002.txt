○A Notice of Apology to the Readers of Samch'ŏlli

At this time, when even the inside of the Peninsula (半島) is shrouded in clouds of sorrow due to the recent sudden incident (突發事變), it is extremely fearful (悚懼) for this magazine alone to celebrate its "Third Anniversary." Therefore, we have completely halted all sorts (萬般) of preparations for the planned (豫定) "Commemorative Special Issue" and are postponing its publication until this coming October. At that time, we intend to appear with a spectacle twice as grand as before (倍前의 盛觀). For that reason (그닭에), please forgive (容恕) that this month's issue is somewhat delayed, and furthermore, we will announce all prize contest recruitments (懸賞募集) in the October issue as well. Also, we will continue to accept submissions (投稿) regarding "Samch'ŏlli's Distinctive Feature (三千里의 一色)" and "Betrayed Comrades and the Love Triangle (背叛한 同志及三角戀愛)," so please send many good manuscripts (原稿).

Samch'ŏlli Representative Paek (三千里責任者白)

**Summary**

The publisher of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine apologizes to readers for postponing the planned "Third Anniversary Commemorative Special Issue" from July to October 1931. The reason cited is a "sudden incident" causing widespread anxiety on the Korean Peninsula, making a celebration inappropriate. The notice asks for understanding regarding the delay of the current issue and the postponement of prize announcements, while encouraging continued submissions for specific article series. For historians, this notice is significant as it directly reflects the impact of contemporary events – almost certainly the Wanpaoshan Incident and the ensuing anti-Chinese riots across Korea in early July 1931 – on cultural production and public sentiment during the colonial period. It highlights the pervasive tension and instability that could force even celebratory events to be cancelled.
