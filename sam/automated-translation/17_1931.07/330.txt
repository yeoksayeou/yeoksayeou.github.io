World Proletarian Representatives

Country Name Lower House Seats Proletarian Reps. Percentage
United Kingdom 615 289 4.70
Germany 493 152 38.0
Ireland 151 14 9.0
United States 435 1 0.2

France 612 101 16.5 <80>

**Summary**

This brief article presents statistics comparing the representation of "proletarian" members in the lower houses of parliament across six major countries: the UK, Germany, Ireland, the US, Japan, and France, as of 1931. It lists the total number of lower house seats, the number of seats held by proletarian representatives, and the resulting percentage for each country. For historians studying Korean colonial history, this piece is interesting as it reflects a global interest in socialist or labor movements and their political representation. The inclusion of Japan, the colonial power, with its relatively low percentage (1.2%), provides context for the political landscape influencing Korea at the time, where similar movements were often suppressed but intellectually tracked. The data (despite potential inaccuracies, like the UK's 4.70% which seems low for 289/615 seats) highlights the varying degrees of success such movements had achieved internationally.
