Jokes

Romantic

"Hey Kyŏngae! How did you meet your second husband?"
"Why? If I tell you the story, it's quite romantic. That man, you see... he beat my first husband to death with the club he had. That's how we got to know each other. Quite romantic, isn't it? Just like a novel, wouldn't you say?"

Quitting Smoking

A mother discovered her eldest son, not yet an adult, smoking cigarettes and scolded him harshly. Then, still worried, she coaxed her nine-year-old younger son, saying:
Mother: "Baby, you're still young, you shouldn't touch cigarettes."
Second Son: "Uh-huh, Mother," the second son replied immediately.
Second Son: "I quit smoking recently."
Mother: "Huh?" <32>

**Summary**

This article presents two short jokes. The first, titled "Romantic," features a woman darkly recounting meeting her second husband after he killed her first with a club, finding the situation "romantic." The second, "Quitting Smoking," describes a mother warning her nine-year-old son against smoking after catching his older brother, only for the younger boy to claim he recently quit, implying he was also smoking. These jokes, one dark and the other situational, reflect the humor of the period. For historians, they offer a glimpse into popular entertainment, social commentary (albeit light) on themes like marriage, violence, and parenting norms (like concerns over underage smoking), and showcase the Korean language usage of the early 1930s.
