A Word of Entrustment

Dear Readers (愛讀者 諸氏), if there is not yet a branch office (支社) of "Samch'ŏlli" (『삼천리』) where you reside, we earnestly desire the establishment of a branch office or sales outlet (販賣所). If you request the internal regulations (內規) by sending a 2-chŏn stamp, we will send them.

**Summary**

This brief notice from the Samch'ŏlli magazine's sales department appeals to its readers for assistance in expanding the magazine's distribution network. It asks readers located in areas without a current branch office or sales outlet to consider establishing one. The notice provides practical information, stating that the internal regulations detailing the process can be obtained by mail upon sending a 2-chŏn stamp. From a historical perspective, this notice is interesting as it illustrates a grassroots approach to business expansion by a Korean cultural publication during the Japanese colonial period, relying on reader loyalty and initiative to overcome potential distribution hurdles. It also provides a small glimpse into the economic realities, mentioning the cost associated with obtaining the necessary information.
