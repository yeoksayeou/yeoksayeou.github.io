**Summary**

This article provides a comparative list of annual salaries for top government officials (presidents, prime ministers, ministers) in the UK, US, Germany, France, and Japan as of 1931. It details the specific amounts paid in the respective national currencies (Pounds, Dollars, Marks, Francs, Yen). For historians studying colonial Korea, this article is interesting as it presents information about international standards of government compensation, including that of the colonial power, Japan. This could have allowed Korean readers to compare the salaries of Japanese officials, who governed them, with those of leaders in other major world powers, potentially shaping perceptions about Japan's status and the resources allocated to its administration.
