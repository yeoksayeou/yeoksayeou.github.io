Debate (論爭)

1. Sitting with a friend, engaging in debate,
Emotions flared, even curses were hurled;
On this drizzly night, I think of my Guan Bao (管鮑 - referring to the deep friendship of Guan Zhong and Bao Shuya).

2. After the fight, we sat apart from each other,
Each performing his own silent play,
But this actor named Su (洙沫란 - likely a self-reference by the author Yi Ŭngsu) felt sorrow for life.

3. After the debate ended, my composed friend
Confessed, almost, "I too am human."
I ask, what does being human mean?

4. To my friend's confession that he had always been reluctant
To debate with me, I too felt the same;
Unfortunately, both friends had much stubbornness (뻣칠 性).

5. My friend knew. As I quietly fell asleep,<82>
Lest I be cold, he silently rose
And covered me with a blanket—my calmed heart.

6. The very next day, I left that place.
In his postcard that arrived a few days later,
He wrote words of apology, asking forgiveness for his carelessness (輕率).

Thinking of My Love (넷님 생각하며)

1. My sentimental love, inside X person's poetry collection,
Sent a lock of hair tucked within;
Counting the strands as I go, I gently stroke it.

2. Our marriage, facing many obstacles (難關),
While worrying about it on one hand,
I find my eyes drawn to the "Home" section of my magazine.

3. While I was away, my younger sibling took the poetry collection out
And lost the lock of your hair—
My mind was such that I wanted to scold them enough to kill them?

4. Where have you gone this long night?
In your room, folded neatly but lonely,
Only your blanket evokes your body heat (體溫)? <83>

**Summary**

This work by Yi Ŭngsu consists of two sets of short poems. The first set, "Debate," explores the intensity of a friendship tested by a heated argument, followed by quiet reconciliation and lingering thoughts on human nature and stubbornness. The second set, "Thinking of My Love," expresses tender longing for an absent beloved, focusing on keepsakes like a lock of hair and the painful awareness of obstacles to their marriage, contrasting personal feelings with societal constraints implied by the mention of a magazine's "Home" section. From a historical perspective, these poems offer a glimpse into the personal emotional lives of Koreans during the colonial period. They reveal the endurance of intimate relationships—friendship and romantic love—amidst potential external pressures (implied by the difficulties in marriage). The blend of traditional themes (like referencing Guan Bao) with modern anxieties (worrying about marriage, reading magazines) might interest historians studying cultural shifts and personal expression in 1930s Korea.

論爭

1. 벗과안저서 論爭을베풀다가
감정을내여 辱說까지퍼붓는
보슬비나리는밤 내管鮑를생각네

2. 싸운뒤에는 서로갈러저안저
제각기지아금 무언극을演하되
洙沫란이배우는 인생을설어하다

3. 논쟁끈난뒤 沈着한나의벗은
고백비슷이 『나도인간이니까』
뭇노니인간이란 무엇을뜻함인가

4. 나와논쟁키를 항상끄려왓노란
벗의고백에 나역동감이엇나니
불행히도두벗은 뻣칠性이만엇다.

추을세라 조용히일어서서
이불을덥허주는 가러안즌내마음

몃칠뒤에온 그의葉書에는
輕率을용서하란 사죄말을썻더라

머리끌한아 끼워보내섯길래

한편으로는 근심은하면서도
내雜誌의家庭欄을 눈띄워보는구료

3. 내업는새에 시집을들고나가

죽이기십흘만치 꾸짓든심사는?

4. 기나긴밤을 그대는어대가고
