Two Jokes

Something in Common

Teacher - Poktong, this composition titled "My House's Puppy" is exactly the same as your older brother's composition.
Poktong - Yes, but Teacher, that's because the dog my older brother saw and the dog I saw are the same puppy from our house.

Surveillance Duty

President - I heard you were absent while I was away in P'yŏngyang. What happened, were you sick?
Employee - No, I went on a business trip.
President - Who ordered a business trip that I didn't order?
Employee - Well, actually, your wife told me to follow you.<215>

**Summary**

This article presents two short jokes from 1940. The first involves a student explaining why his composition about his dog is identical to his brother's – it's the same dog. The second features an employee admitting his unapproved "business trip" to follow his boss was ordered by the boss's suspicious wife. For historians, the text offers a small window into everyday life and humor during the colonial period, reflecting common situations in school and the workplace. The language itself, with its older spellings and grammatical forms (e.g., '갓구나', '그러치만', '하엿슴니다', '단녀', '-서오'), is valuable for studying the evolution of the Korean language and documenting colloquialisms of the era.
