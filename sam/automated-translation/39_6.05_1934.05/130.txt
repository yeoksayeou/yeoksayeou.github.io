春曉 (Spring Dawn)
						孟浩然 (Meng Haoran)
In spring sleep, I don't notice the dawn.
Everywhere, I hear birds cry.
Last night, the sound of wind and rain.
How many flowers fell, I wonder?<41>

**Summary**

The article presents the famous Tang dynasty Chinese poem "Chūn Xiǎo" (Spring Dawn) by Meng Haoran. The poem describes waking up on a spring morning, realizing dawn has broken unnoticed during sleep, hearing birdsong everywhere, and then recalling the sounds of wind and rain during the night, prompting a gentle wonder about how many blossoms might have fallen. For historians, the inclusion of this classical Chinese poem in a popular Korean magazine from 1934 highlights the persistence of traditional Sinitic literary culture and education among Koreans during the Japanese colonial period, serving as a marker of cultural identity and intellectual engagement beyond the immediate political context.
