A Day in the Life of a Newspaper President - Mr. Lyuh Woon-hyung, President of the Chungang Ilbo

As a sportsman, Mr. Lyuh usually rises early, before 7 AM. Since his house is near Ch'wiun-jŏng (翠雲亭), he goes up to Ch'wiun-jŏng, strolls through the woods, contemplates the day's work with a clear mind, or, during times like winter, rushes to the skating rink in Samch'ŏng-dong Kongwŏn (三淸洞公園) to join male and female students for a round of skating to train his body. Afterwards, around 10 AM, he walks briskly and cheerfully to the company office in Kyŏnji-dong (堅志洞).

There, he confers with Vice President Ch'oe Sŏn-ik (崔善益), Editorial Bureau Chief Kim Tong-sŏng (金東成), Business Bureau Chief Hong Chŏng-sik (洪璔植), and others about plans to make the company a large joint-stock corporation worth about 1 million won, strategies to increase newspaper circulation, and coordination regarding matters with the Police Affairs Bureau (警務局關係). Afterwards, if friends come from afar – indeed, Mr. Lyuh has many friends who come from afar – he accompanies them to the Chosŏn Hotel for a Western-style lunch, chats, and strolls through the hotel's rose garden. Returning, from around 3 or 4 PM, he attends wedding ceremonies of young friends to officiate – he truly enjoyed officiating weddings since his time in Sanghae (上海), and with his refreshing, imposing physique and eloquent speech like flowing water, he has earned a reputation as the best officiant of the era. If there's an athletic meet, he goes there to perform the ceremonial first pitch. In the evenings, he hosts people for newspaper-related or personal reasons, attends invitations received, meets friends for lively discussions, and occasionally visits the Government-General or homes of relevant high officials for social interaction. However, he tries to return home early whenever possible to help his beloved children with their studies, becoming a good old dad (好好老爺) in a harmonious family.

His Western style from his Sanghae days – where he would mingle and run around with young and old alike, play football in places like the French Park (佛欄西公園), buy bread to share sitting in a circle, and play cheerfully – still remains, and it should be remembered that there are indeed many youths and adolescents who follow him.

**Summary**

This article details the daily routine of Lyuh Woon-hyung, the president of the *Chungang Ilbo* newspaper in 1934. It portrays him as an active and modern figure, starting his day early with exercise like walking or skating, followed by meetings at the newspaper office focusing on business expansion and dealing with colonial authorities (Police Affairs Bureau). His afternoons and evenings are filled with social engagements, including officiating weddings, attending sports events, dining with friends and associates, and occasionally engaging in social visits with officials from the Government-General, while still aiming to return home early for family time. The article emphasizes his approachable, Westernized manner, particularly his ability to connect with the youth, stemming from his time in Shanghai. For historians, this piece offers a valuable glimpse into the life of a prominent Korean nationalist figure navigating the complexities of colonial society. It shows his efforts to build a modern Korean enterprise (the newspaper), his social influence (officiating weddings, popularity with youth), and his necessary, albeit likely cautious, interactions with the Japanese colonial administration (Police Affairs Bureau, Government-General officials).
