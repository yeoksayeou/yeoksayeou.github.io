**Summary**

This article from the May 1934 issue of Samch'ŏlli magazine consists of captions accompanying a series of photographs. The images depict the Yi Royal Family members like King Yi (Yi Ŭn), Emperor Sunjong, Emperor Kojong, the Queen Dowager, and Princess Tŏkhye during a royal ceremony and gathering; vanished scenes of old Seoul including parts of Namdaemun, Kyŏngbok Palace's Yŏngch'umun Gate area, and Sŏdaemun Gate; prominent contemporary figures such as writers Yi Kwangsu and Song Chinu, and artist Na Hyesŏk; and stills or promotional shots from popular plays or films of the era ("Chang Han Mong," "Se Tongmu," "Nak'wa Yusu," "K'ŭn Mudŏm," "Sugyŏng Nangja Chŏn," "Ongnyŏ") featuring actors like Chu Samson, Kim Unsil, Pok Hyesuk, Na Un'gyu, Yun Pongch'un, Cho Kyŏngok, and Kim Ok.

For historians, this piece is interesting as it reflects multiple facets of Korean society under Japanese rule in the mid-1930s. It shows the continued symbolic presence and representation of the former monarchy, documents the physical transformation and loss of heritage in the capital city, and captures the vibrant cultural scene, including leading intellectuals and the burgeoning entertainment industry (film/theatre). The juxtaposition of these elements in a popular magazine provides insight into public consciousness, nostalgia, and cultural consumption during the colonial period.
