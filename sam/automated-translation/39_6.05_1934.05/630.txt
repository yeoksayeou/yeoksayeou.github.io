**Body Text Translation:**
Yearning / Lovesickness
						Sŏngch'ŏn Famous Kisaeng Kim Puyong

The road is far,
News is slow.

My thoughts are there,
My body is here.

Tears on the silk scarf,
The round silk fan awaits no set date. <132>

Fragrant pavilion, the bell rings at night,
Yŏnjŏng Pavilion, when the moon rises.

Leaning on a high pillow, startled from a lingering dream,
Gazing at returning clouds, I resent the distant separation.

Waiting for the auspicious date under the moon, sadly counting on my fingers,
In the morning, opening the love letter, I weep, leaning on my chin.

My appearance is haggard; holding the mirror, tears fall,
My singing voice is choked, making others feel sorrow.

Drawing a silver knife to cut my weak heart is not a difficult thing,
Treading in pearl slippers, sending my gaze far, yet more doubts arise.

You didn't come yesterday, you don't come today; lover, how heartless you are!
Gazing afar in the morning, gazing afar in the evening; I alone am deceived.

After the P'ae River becomes flat land, will you whip your horse and ride here?
When the long forest turns into a great sea, will you first board a boat, wanting to cross? <133>

Times of meeting are few, times of parting are many; human feelings, no one can fathom.
Good fate is broken, bad knots are tied in the heart; Heaven's will, who can know?

A fragment of fragrant cloud, the Chu Terrace night, the dream of the goddess—where is it now?
Several sounds from a fine brush, the Ch'in Tower moon, Nongok's feelings—to whom do they belong?

Not thinking, yet thinking, slightly leaning on Moktan Peak, my lovable red face grows old.
Wanting to forget, yet hard to forget, forcing myself to climb Pubyŏk Pavilion, always lamenting my fading dark hair.

Alone in my frosty chamber, my heart pure as snow; our good promise spanning three lives, how could it change?
Sleeping alone in an empty room, though tears fall like rain; my hundred-year fragrant heart remains unmoved.

Ending my spring nap, I open the bamboo window; welcoming the flower-willow youths, they are all heartless guests.
Disturbing fragrant clothes, pushing aside the jade pillow, sending off the singing and dancing travelers—are they not detestable boys? <134>

Reference - Kim Puyong (金芙蓉), whose pen name was Ch'usu (秋水), was a famous kisaeng of Sŏngch'ŏn (成川) 260 years ago, renowned in Chinese poetry (漢詩) circles for her skill in calligraphy, painting, poetry, and prose (書畵詩賦). Furthermore, this particular piece, "Sangsah" (相思), modeled after a free verse style (自由詩型), holds even deeper meaning in freely containing its fluent (暢達) poetic thoughts (詩想). This magazine (本誌) intends to serialize the poems and songs of this famous kisaeng every month. <134>

**Summary**

This article presents a Hanja poem titled "Sangsah" (Yearning) by Kim Puyong, identified in the commentary as a renowned kisaeng from Sŏngch'ŏn 260 years prior, skilled in arts and literature. The poem expresses the deep sorrow and unwavering faithfulness of a woman separated from her lover, questioning his return while reaffirming her own constancy despite loneliness, the passage of time, and the presence of other superficial suitors. The accompanying note highlights Kim Puyong's historical significance and praises the poem's "free verse style" and emotional depth, announcing plans to serialize her work. For historians, this piece is interesting as it shows a 1930s Korean magazine actively promoting and re-evaluating figures from Korea's pre-modern cultural past, specifically a kisaeng celebrated for her literary talents. Publishing classical Hanja poetry and framing it within contemporary terms like "free verse" reflects efforts during the colonial period to assert a distinct Korean literary heritage and perhaps adapt traditional forms to modern sensibilities.

相思
						成川名妓 金芙蓉


路遠
信遲

念在彼
身有茲

紗巾有淚
紈扇無期<132>

香閣鍾鳴夜
練亭月上時

倚高枕驚殘夢
望歸雲恨遠離

月待佳期愁屈指
晨開情札泣支頤

容貌憔悴把鏡下淚
歌聲鳴咽令人含悲

掣銀刀斷弱膓非難事
躡珠履送遠眸更多疑

昨不來今不來郞何無情
朝遠望暮遠望妾獨有欺

浿江作平陸后鞭馬騎來否
長林變大海初乘船欲渡之<133>

逢時少別時多人情無人可測
好緣斷惡締懷天意有誰能知

一斷香雲楚臺夜神女之夢在某
數聲良筆秦樓月弄玉之情屬誰

不思自思稍倚牧丹峯可情紅顔老
欲忘難忘强登浮碧樓每傷綠鬢衰

孤處霜閨膓能若雪三生佳約寧有變
獨宿空房淚縱如雨百年芳心猶不移

罷春睡開竹窓迎花柳少年摠是無情客
攪香衣推玉枕送歌舞遊子莫非可憎兒

참고-金芙蓉은 號를 秋水과 하야 260년 전 成川名妓로서 書畵詩賦를 잘 하야 漢詩 문단에 盛名을 날이든 분이다. 더구나 「相思」의 此一篇은 自由詩型을 본떠 그 暢達한 詩想을 마음대로 담은데 더욱 뜻이 깁다. 本誌는 매월 계속하야 이 名妓의 詩歌를 연재코저 하노라.<134>
