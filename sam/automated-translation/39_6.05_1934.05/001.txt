The Wind is a South Wind
						P'ain

1
The wind is a south wind,
The season is April,
On the ridge of the field yonder
A skylark flies.

As if someone, someone
Is calling,
I run out
To the bank of the stream in front.

White willow catkins,
Smiling,
Beckoning with a hand gesture,
Pass me by.


2
The wind is a south wind,
The season is April,
The frozen river water
Thaws and flows down.

Upon the river water,
A small boat,
Floating and dipping,
Drifts like a dream.

If it's a boat from the south (Kangnam),
Might it carry flowers?
If the flower season comes early,
Might it carry my beloved?
-1934, Spring-<8>

**Summary**

This poem by P'ain paints a gentle picture of spring's arrival in Korea, marked by the south wind, thawing rivers, skylarks, and willow catkins in April. The imagery evokes a sense of awakening nature and includes a subtle note of longing or anticipation symbolized by a small boat drifting on the river, possibly arriving from the south (Kangnam) laden with flowers or even the speaker's beloved. From a historical perspective, the poem is interesting as an example of lyrical expression focused on nature and personal sentiment during the Japanese colonial period. Such works, avoiding direct political commentary, offered a space for cultural expression and perhaps subtle articulations of hope or yearning for normalcy and reunion.

바람은 南風,
시절은 四月,
리밧 녁에
종달새 난다

누구가 누구가
불느는 듯
압내 강변에
내다라 보니

하얀 버들
우스며
손질 하며
지나가 버린다

2
바람은 南風,
시절은 四月,
어럿든 강물이
풀니어 나린다

강물 우에
배 하나
다 잠겻다
가치 흐른다

강남서 온배면
실 엇슬가
철이 일느면
님실 엇스리
