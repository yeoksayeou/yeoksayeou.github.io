Art School Principal and Ms. Na Hye-sŏk

Regarding the female painter, Ms. Na Hye-sŏk, who returned after studying painting in Paris, the city of flowers, many people have been asking what dreams she is dreaming, as there is absolutely no news, one way or another, about her on the surface of society. We answer collectively. Ms. Na is currently considering taking over and managing a certain women's art school in the city that is in difficulty due to financial hardship, and also has the grand ambition to establish a new women's art school, and is actively working to prepare the funds. In any case, perhaps in 1934, a female principal wearing a crown might emerge.

Song Chin-u, Man of Energy

After Ch'unwŏn [Yi Kwang-su] was promoted to Vice President of the Chosŏn Ilbo and left, at the Tonga Ilbo, where he had been Editor-in-Chief, President Song Chin-u has decided to concurrently handle the Editor-in-Chief duties. It is said he arrives at the office every morning at 10 AM sharp, inspects and reads all the numerous manuscripts, and leaves the office every day at 4 PM sharp. At such a tightly scheduled time, Mr. Song's heart must surely be earnestly hoping for the return of Mr. Chang Tŏk-su from North America.<102>

Mr. Hŏ Hŏn and Gold Mines

Former Sin'ganhoe Chairman Mr. Hŏ Hŏn has recently been bustling between Seoul and the countryside. We investigated whether some great world event was moving, but it turns out that Mr. Hŏ, who used to lament the difficulty of securing capital for every single matter, has retreated, so to speak, to weave fishing nets. He has discovered 5 or 6 gold mining districts somewhere in Hamgyŏng Province and is in the midst of large-scale excavation. According to what we hear, that gold mine is in the vicinity of the one Mr. Yi Yong-ik used to dedicate to the Emperor, and its mineral vein had been buried for decades, only now to be re-excavated by Mr. Hŏ's hand. If it is a treasure rare in the world, has it found the right owner?

The Widow of Mr. Yi Chong-ho

Wŏlsong Yi Chong-ho is already deceased. As the eldest grandson of Mr. Yi Yong-ik, he was once branded as pro-Russian and traveled abroad for many years, returned the previous year, but regrettably passed away without even seeing the outcome of his grandfather's 900,000 yen incident concerning the Dai-Ichi Bank. For his widow, Mrs. Cho, who was guarding the family left destitute after his death, recently Messrs. Yun Ik-sŏn, Ch'oe Rin, and others have stepped forward to collect donations from friends. For the descendant of a prestigious family to starve for a measure of rice, can this land be called a place where people live? It is a heartwarming story.

The Tracks of Mr. Pang Eung-mo

The fact that Messrs. Pang Eung-mo, Ko Il-ch'ŏng, and Yi Kwang-su traveled in Tokyo and Osaka<103> for 20 days and returned is a matter commonly known by people. Hearing the behind-the-scenes story of their trip, the party of three hosted a banquet one night in Tokyo, inviting prominent figures such as ministers, political party members, and figures from financial and press circles. Surprisingly, the banquet cost was about 40 yen. Furthermore, it is reported that there was even a message from the Minister of Colonial Affairs.

Famous Actor's Provincial Tour

Famous actor Mr. Na Un-gyu is leading some kind of theater troupe and touring the humble provinces during this flower-blooming fine spring season. While being the same kind of actor, people like Japan's Ōkōchi Denjirō have earned a personal fortune of 500,000 yen, and even someone like Kataoka Chiezō has earned 150,000 yen through acting alone. Yet, for the sin of being born on the Peninsula, Mr. Na merely avoids starvation through provincial tours with such fame and such skill. Alas, whose fault is it?

Kim Ki-jŏn, Gradually Recovering

Mr. Kim Ki-jŏn, former leader of the Ch'ŏndogyo Chŏngu Party, who received the alarming diagnosis of third-stage lung disease and has been recuperating at Hall Hospital in Haeju, is, as a man of will, striving to overcome the illness. Recently, his progress has been very good, and it is said he might be able to take short walks indoors starting from the new spring. Is it only the Ch'ŏndogyo comrades who pray for this talented person of his generation to make a comeback again?<104>

**Summary**

This article provides brief updates on the activities and situations of several prominent Korean figures in 1934. It covers Na Hye-sŏk's potential return to the art scene by establishing a school, Song Chin-u taking on more duties at the Tonga Ilbo, Hŏ Hŏn venturing into gold mining, fundraising efforts for the destitute widow of Yi Chong-ho, Pang Eung-mo's trip to Japan with Yi Kwang-su and Ko Il-ch'ŏng, Na Un-gyu's struggles touring the provinces despite his fame, and Kim Ki-jŏn's gradual recovery from illness. The article offers glimpses into the varied fortunes of the Korean elite under Japanese rule, highlighting financial hardships (Na Hye-sŏk, Yi Chong-ho's widow), entrepreneurial ventures (Hŏ Hŏn), engagement with Japanese authorities (Pang Eung-mo), and the stark contrast between the success of Japanese cultural figures and the difficulties faced by their Korean counterparts (Na Un-gyu). Historians might find the piece valuable for its insights into the personal lives, economic realities, cultural disparities, and political undercurrents affecting well-known Koreans during this period.

三千里人生案內
美術校長과 羅蕙錫氏

꼿의 巴里에 畵家修業을 갓다가 도라온 女流畵伯 羅蕙錫女史는 엇든 꿈을 꾸길래 도모지 사회의 표면에는 이러타 저러타하는 소식이 업는가 하고 世人의 질문이 만키에 一括하여 대답함니다. 羅女史는 방금 財産難으로 困境에 잇는 市內 某女子美術學校를 引繼 經營할 생각도 가지고 그래서 새로 女子美術學校 하나를 新設할 굉장한 포부도 가지고 돈을 준비코저 활약중인데 아무튼 1934년대에는 冠을 쓴 女校長 한 분이 나설는지 모른다고 하옵니다.

精力主義의 宋鎭禹

春園이 朝鮮日報副社長으로 昇任하여 나간 뒤 編輯局長을 이른 東亞日報에서는 社長 宋鎭禹氏가 局長일을 兼처 보기로 되어 每朝 10시 定刻登廳 그 만흔 原稿를 일일히 檢讀 下午 4시 定刻退廳을 매일 한다고 이러케람이 째인때 氏의 胸中에는 應當 北米 張德秀氏의 歸來를 懇望하고 잇스련만.<102>

許憲氏와 金鑛

前 新幹會長 許憲氏는 최근 京鄕間을 분주히 來往하는데 무슨 天下大勢가 움지기는가 아러본즉 每事每事에 資本金難을 歎하든 氏는 退하야 漁網을 짜는 格으로 咸鏡道 어느 곳 金鑛區를 5, 6區 발견하야 크게 採堀 중이라는데 듯건대 그 金鑛은 옛날 李容翊氏가 上에 바치든 그 부근의 金鑛으로 數十年來 鑛脉이 뭇처잇든 것이 今也 許氏 손으로 再發堀됨 이라고 稀世의 보물이면 주인을 올케 차젓슴인가.

李鍾浩氏 未亡人

月松 李鍾浩氏는 이미 고인이 되섯다. 李容翊氏 장손으로 일즉 親露派로 몰니어서 다년 해외를 遊歷하다가 전년 드러와 조부의 對第一銀行 九十萬圓事件의 결과도 보지 못한 채 애석하게 作故한 분인데 死后 赤貧如洗한 가정을 직히고 잇든 未亡人 趙氏를 위하야 近來 尹益善, 崔麟 등 諸氏가 선두에 나서서 知友들에게 義捐을 募하고 잇다. 명문의 후예가 斗米에 주우려서야 이 땅을 사람 사는 땅이라 하랴 美談이다.

方應模氏의 자최

方應模, 高一淸, 李光洙의 3氏가 東京 大阪으로<103> 20일 간을 遊歷하고 도라온 일은 世人共知하는 事어니아 그 자츼의 후문을 듯건대 3氏일행이 東京서 大臣, 政黨, 財界, 言論界 등의 명사를 초대하고 一夜의 宴을 베풀엇는데 勿驚 그 宴會費用이 40여 원이엇다고 더욱 拓務大臣의 視辭까지 잇섯다고 전한다.

名優의 地方巡廻

名優 羅雲奎氏는 무슨 劇團인가 끄을고 이 꼿피는 三春佳節에 邊陋한 지방으로 巡業을 한다고 가튼 俳優면서 日本의 大河內傳次郞가튼 사람은 私財 50만원, 片岡千惠藏가튼 사람도 15만원울 俳優演技 하나로 버을고 잇다는데, 그만한 名聲과 그만한 技倆을 가지고 半島에 태어난 罪로 羅氏 한갓 地方巡業로서 免飢한다니 아하 누구의 罪인고.

漸快하는 金起田

肺病 제3기라는 놀나온 宣告를 밧고 그동안 海州 홀병원에 이르러 精養 中이든 前天道政靑 黨首 金起田氏는 원래 意志의 人이만치 병을 극복하기를 힘써 최근은 매우 經過 良好하야 새해 봄부터는 室內散策쯤은 될 듯하다 한다. 一代의 才人이 다시 再起함을 비는 이 엇지 天道敎 同志들 뿐이랴.<104>
