Autumn of My Later Years
						Pak Yŏnghyo

The sea is vast, the sky is high, sun and moon shine brightly;

Wind and clouds change, a myriad transformations unfold.

Sitting idly, sometimes I break into a solitary smile;

The green pine stands aloof, the bamboo leans gently.<59>

**Summary**

This short Hanja poem by Pak Yŏnghyo depicts a contemplative mood set against a backdrop of vast nature and changing circumstances. The poet observes the expansive sea and sky, the shifting wind and clouds, finding moments of quiet amusement while reflecting on the steadfastness of the pine and the gentleness of the bamboo. It evokes a sense of detached observation likely associated with later life. From a historical perspective, the publication of a traditional Hanja poem by a figure like Pak Yŏnghyo (a key player in late 19th-century reform attempts who later held positions under Japanese rule) in a popular vernacular magazine like *Samch'ŏlli* in 1934 is noteworthy. It highlights the persistence of elite cultural forms and might offer subtle insights into the reflections of a historical figure navigating the complexities of the colonial era.
