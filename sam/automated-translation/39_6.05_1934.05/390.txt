Article Title: 朝鮮에 태여난 것이 幸福한가 不幸한가 (Is Being Born in Korea Fortunate or Unfortunate?)
Author: 金活蘭
Article Type: 설문 (Survey/Questionnaire Response)

I consider being born in Chosŏn (朝鮮) a happiness. The reason is that there is nothing as unfortunate as a person with nothing to do in the world, and it is fortunate (多幸) to have been born in Chosŏn (朝鮮) where there is much work to be done.<78>

**Summary**

Kim Hwallan states that she considers being born in Korea a happiness, not despite its challenges, but because of them. She argues that having much work to do, as is the case in Korea, is fortunate, contrasting it with the unhappiness of idleness. This perspective is interesting for historians studying the colonial period as it reflects a proactive, perhaps nationalistic or developmentalist, outlook among some Korean intellectuals. It frames the difficulties faced by Korea not just as burdens, but as opportunities for meaningful contribution and purpose, offering insight into coping mechanisms and ideologies present during that time.
