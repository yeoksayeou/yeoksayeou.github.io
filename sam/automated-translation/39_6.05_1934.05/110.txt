三千里春秋
						滄浪客

April and May are the Peninsula's political season. In the past, the Singanhoe Convention(?), the Three General Annual Meeting(?), May Day, and Children's Day created tension, but nowadays, only religious conferences barely break the silence. The scenery south of the river is leisurely/quiet.

American influence begins its retreat. Is it because of the financial panic? Could it truly be that Great America doesn't have the few pennies to give to Chosŏn? The point is, the American 'Amen' lacks understanding of the Chosŏn 'Amen'.

If newspaper presidents had a mandatory retirement age (停年制), with new figures under 40 chosen by popular demand appearing every 3 years, tell the moneybags major shareholders to get lost.

Sano Manabu (佐野學) declares the failure of the past communist movement. If one were to posit a thesis about Chosŏn's underground movement, how much distance would there be from this? If it was an experiment, 10 years is already enough.

The involved parties deny that the 'Yŏnjŏnghoe' (硏政會) existed, yet it's recorded as existing in the writings of the then-police chief Chiba Ryō (千葉了). A strange spectacle (奇觀).

If only Tŏksu Old Palace (德壽古宮) hadn't been opened to the public. The mystery of the royal palace, the dream of dignity, could have lingered. Alas, how shabby (鳴呼貧弱)! Even the new warriors of Annam (安南) wouldn't be like this.

It's said that petitions are flooding the Governor-General (總督) demanding the implementation of a conscription order (懲兵令). Is the time coming to shoulder a rifle?

Politician Mr. Yŏ Unhyŏng (呂運亨), you seem excessively interested in a certain love affair between a man and a woman. This is excessive awareness; excess is a worry, and deficiency is also a worry. <39>

**Summary**

This column by "Ch'angnang'aek" offers brief, critical commentary on various aspects of Korean society in Spring 1934. It notes the decline of political activity compared to past years, questions the reasons for waning American influence (possibly missionary), advocates for reform in newspaper leadership, reflects on the declared failure of Japanese communism and its implications for Korean underground movements, points out a discrepancy regarding a supposed political group (Yŏnjŏnghoe), laments the perceived shabbiness of Tŏksu Palace after being opened to the public, mentions petitions for conscription, and mildly criticizes politician Yŏ Unhyŏng for focusing on gossip. The piece provides historians with a contemporary snapshot of colonial-era concerns, including the suppression of political movements, commentary on foreign influence, media critique, the status of former royal sites, the looming prospect of military conscription for Koreans, and observations on prominent figures, all expressed with a tone of weary cynicism characteristic of the period.
