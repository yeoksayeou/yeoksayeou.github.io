A. Have you heard the story about a certain Mr. Pak (朴某氏) receiving ten thousand won?

B. What were the circumstances?

A. Mr. Pak (朴某氏) apparently went imposingly to visit a certain Mr. So-and-so (某氏) in Hamnam (咸南) province, and after making his speech-like plea, he ultimately asked for aid of 3,000 won.

B. So, what did he say?

A. No, he did give it, but in response to the 3,000 won request, he threw down a bundle of ten thousand won, saying, "I thought this Pak Mo-ssi was a big figure, but is he really going around bowing his head for just 3,000 won? Tsk, I'll give you ten thousand won, so take it and use it."

B. What a great man (傑物)!

A. Yes, in a certain sense, it's a masterpiece (傑作). <121>

**Summary**

This short anecdote recounts how a certain Mr. Pak requested 3,000 won from a wealthy individual in Hamnam province. Instead of granting the requested amount, the wealthy person gave Mr. Pak 10,000 won while criticizing him for seeking such a small sum despite being perceived as an important figure. The wealthy person's action is described ironically as both impressive ("great man") and a "masterpiece". For historians, this piece offers a glimpse into social hierarchies, the performance of wealth, and economic perceptions in 1930s colonial Korea. The interaction highlights notions of status tied to financial means and perhaps hints at the kinds of financial needs or expectations prominent figures might have had, contrasted with the sometimes ostentatious generosity (or condescension) of the wealthy.
