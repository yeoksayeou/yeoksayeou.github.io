A. Before you die, you should take a trip to Sŏnch'ŏn.

B. Why is that?

A. If you take the Kyŏngbu Line, Kyŏngin Line, or Kyŏngwŏn Line, don't they display huge advertisement texts like 「Fukusuke Tabi (福助ケ地下袋)」, 「Morishita Jintan (森下仁丹)」, or 「Asano Cement (淺野セメント)」 across large mountains and fields, disgusting thoughtful passengers?

B. You mean it spoils the scenery (風致)? That's true.

A. But if you go to Sŏnch'ŏn, right along the railway line, on the entire face of Apnam Mountain (압南山), they've written in large Korean script (朝鮮 언文), "Prohibit Alcohol, Abstain from Tobacco (금주단연)." It really shows the noble spirit (志氣) of the local people (地方人士) of this region; it's truly delightful.

B. Indeed, if that's true, the people of Sŏnch'ŏn are "first-class citizens (一等市民)." That may be so, but if you go to P'yŏngyang, I hear there are many houses that have put up tin doorplates (양쳘 문패) reading "Badge of a Member of the Temperance and Anti-Smoking Association (禁酒斷煙會員之章)." They say it's the achievement (공적) of Mr. Cho Man-sik (曺晩植氏) and others; these are truly beautiful deeds (의거).<229>

**Summary**

The article presents a dialogue contrasting the large Japanese commercial advertisements seen along major Korean railway lines, which the speaker finds distasteful, with public declarations of temperance and anti-smoking seen in Sŏnch'ŏn and P'yŏngyang. The speaker praises the prominent display of "Prohibit Alcohol, Abstain from Tobacco" in Korean script on a mountainside in Sŏnch'ŏn and the proliferation of temperance/anti-smoking association member plaques in P'yŏngyang (attributed to Cho Man-sik) as signs of the noble spirit of the local Korean people, calling them "first-class citizens". For historians, this piece offers a glimpse into cultural tensions during the colonial period, contrasting Japanese commercialism with Korean social reform movements (temperance/anti-smoking). It highlights a subtle form of asserting Korean identity and values (using Korean script, promoting moral campaigns) in the public sphere and notes the influence of nationalist figures like Cho Man-sik in these local movements.
