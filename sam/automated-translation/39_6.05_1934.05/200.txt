Author: Not specified

A. Hey, can't we cure this imitation sickness (模倣病) of the newspaper companies?
B. How so?
A. The year before last, when the *Tonga Ilbo* announced they'd give readers a map of Korea as a New Year's present, wasn't it just a few days later that the *Chosŏn Ilbo* said they'd give the same map of Korea? And last year, it was the same with the map of Manchuria.
B. And then?
A. This year too, when *Tonga* first gave out a world map, didn't *Chosŏn* announce the same thing a few days later?
A. Is it just maps? When *Tonga* launched a company-affiliated sponsored magazine (社附屬御用雜誌), *Chungang* also put out a magazine, didn't they?
B. Right, right. This year, when *Tonga* expanded its newspaper to 10 pages, *Chosŏn* did the same. If they were going to do it anyway, wouldn't it have looked better if they announced it first? Anyway, it seems like *Tonga* is leading the newspaper world.
A. All right, Go<52>

**Summary**

This short dialogue critiques the perceived tendency of Korean newspapers, particularly the *Chosŏn Ilbo*, to merely imitate the initiatives of the *Tonga Ilbo* during the mid-1930s. Examples cited include giveaways like maps (Korean, Manchurian, World), the launch of affiliated magazines, and the expansion of newspaper page counts. The conversation concludes that the *Tonga Ilbo* appears to be the leader setting trends in the Korean newspaper industry at the time. For historians, this piece offers a contemporary snapshot of the competitive dynamics and perceived hierarchy within the colonial Korean press, highlighting the rivalry between major newspapers and contemporary commentary on their business strategies and originality (or lack thereof).
