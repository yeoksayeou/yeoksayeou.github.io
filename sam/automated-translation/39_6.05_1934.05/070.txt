A. Isn't there talk that the Hwasin Trading Company (和信商會) is expanding to P'yŏngyang?
B. Sounds like I heard that.
A. But then that rumor suddenly flew away like the wind (飛去西向風), and in P'yŏngyang, only the P'yŏngan Department Store (平安百貨店) of the Kansŏ region tycoon Mr. Kim Ŭngsu (金應銖) stands tall on Namdaemun-t'ong Main Street (南門通大街), they say.
B. No, I hear that Mr. Pak Yŏsik (朴與植) is buying the houses around that P'yŏngan Department Store, trying to compete.
A. Because of that empty bluff, Mr. Kim unnecessarily bought several nearby houses, they say.
B. Oh right! Then was that also a business strategy (商略)?<38>

**Summary**

This short conversational piece from *Samch'ŏlli* magazine discusses the competitive department store scene in P'yŏngyang in 1934. It mentions a rumored expansion by Hwasin Trading Company that didn't materialize, the establishment of Kim Ŭngsu's P'yŏngan Department Store, and a counter-move by Pak Yŏsik, who is reportedly buying nearby property to compete. The dialogue highlights the rumors and strategic business maneuvers surrounding these developments. For historians, this article offers a glimpse into the vibrant, albeit competitive, landscape of Korean-owned large-scale retail businesses in a major provincial city during the colonial period, showcasing Korean capitalist activity and rivalry separate from direct Japanese competition in this instance.
