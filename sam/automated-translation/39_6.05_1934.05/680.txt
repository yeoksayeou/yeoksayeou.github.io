Samch'ŏlli Go-Stop
The One-Word and One-Topic Hermit

A. Do you know the ‘One-Word Hermits’ (一言居士) of our society?
B. One-Word Hermits?
A. They are indispensable attendees at any gathering (會席), and they invariably make at least one remark. Namely, Mr. Yi Chongnin (李鍾麟氏), Mr. Sŏ Chŏnghŭi (徐廷禧氏), and Mr. Yi In (李仁氏).
B. If so, can’t the term ‘One-Face Hermit’ (一顔居士) also be used?
A. One-Face?
B. Someone who absolutely must show their face at any kind of meeting. Namely, Mr. Yŏ Unhyŏng (呂運亨氏). There’s rarely an athletic meet, a speech, or any gathering (會席) where Mr. Yŏ’s face is missing. Furthermore, he officiates at weddings and even came to give congratulatory remarks at a certain female poet’s publication commemoration party.
A. As a newspaper president, he is extremely active. Although he's nearing fifty years of age (年齒), isn't it just wonderful how he goes around so actively and cheerfully, like a young man?
B. Of course, it’s good. However, if he were to selectively attend only about 30% of the places he's invited to, he would likely have more weight and authority.

Thirty Thousand Won

A. Have you seen the list of wealthy people in all Korea (全朝鮮財産家名薄)?
B. When was it compiled, and by whom?
A. No, I mean the list of promoters’ names for the 300,000 won fundraising drive to build the Posŏng College (普成專門學校) memorial auditorium the other day. It seems there isn't a single wealthy person in all of Korea whose name is missing from it. It’s truly a modern list of the wealthy (財産家名薄).
B. That sounds plausible. By the way, if that 300,000 won isn't fully collected, is it true that the principal, Mr. Kim Sŏngsu (金性洙氏), will cover the shortfall?
B. Supplementing one or two thousand won might be doable, but could he possibly manage tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of won? Perhaps they'll have to scale down and alter the plans.
A. Be that as it may, will Mr. Kim Sŏngsu (金性洙氏) remain the principal of Posŏng College (普專) for long?
B. Rather than entrusting Mr. Kim with only one side's urgent duties (劇務), it seems right to place him at the forefront (第一陣) to oversee (統轄) all enterprises related to the Kim faction. Eventually, Mr. Chang Tŏksu (張德秀氏) or Mr. Kim Pyŏngno (金炳魯氏) will likely become the successor principal.<148>

**Summary**

This short satirical piece from the May 1934 issue of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine uses a dialogue format to comment on prominent figures in Korean society. It first discusses individuals known for always speaking ("One-Word Hermits": Yi Chongnin, Sŏ Chŏnghŭi, Yi In) and then focuses on Yŏ Unhyŏng, dubbed the "One-Face Hermit" for his ubiquitous presence at various events, suggesting his reputation might benefit from more selective appearances. The conversation then shifts to the fundraising effort for Posŏng College's auditorium, noting the list of donors reads like a "who's who" of Korean wealth, and speculates on Principal Kim Sŏngsu's future role and potential successors (Chang Tŏksu, Kim Pyŏngno). For historians, the article offers insights into contemporary social commentary, the perceived characteristics and activities of elite Korean figures like Yŏ Unhyŏng and Kim Sŏngsu under Japanese rule, methods of large-scale fundraising within the Korean community, and subtle critiques of public figures' behaviour and potential political or institutional shifts (like the leadership at Posŏng College).
