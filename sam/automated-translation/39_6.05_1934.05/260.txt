Water flows without 'that' or 'this',
Until one recognizes the moment of division.

The lay of the land has West and East,
Only then realizing the place of merging is one.
<59>

**Summary**

This short Hanja poem by Yi Hyegong uses natural imagery to explore themes of division and unity. The first couplet contrasts the indiscriminate flow of water with the human act of perceiving distinctions. The second couplet notes the geographical distinctions of East and West in the land, yet concludes that the place where they ultimately merge or unite is the same. From a colonial history perspective, the poem's abstract contemplation of division (like West/East, or the act of distinguishing) versus inherent unity (like flowing water or a common point of convergence) could be interpreted subtly. Historians might find its philosophical tone and potential allegorical meaning regarding imposed divisions and underlying oneness interesting within the context of 1930s Korea under Japanese rule.
