述懷
						洪命憙

Autumn wind sends off goose companions
Honking, honking, flying towards the South

A piece of letter suddenly falls before me
Quickly seen, then slowly reread

Receiving it as if finding treasure
Stroking [it?], realizing time has passed

How myriad are the threads of feeling in my heart
Remembering past events dimly

Three [?] my father is old
Willingly accepting [?] wandering/exile

The whole land is unclean
Even settled land has flaws

The child is safe under mother's protection
Mother pities the child's solitary [state?]

Desolate [?] inside the room
All morning long, thinking of good friends

Hastily written few lines of ink
Heart's fragrance shared among close ones brings strength

Body sits like a clay statue [?]
Mind soars like a four-horse chariot

Ari[rang?] thick ice freezes over
Burdened, the White-clad people cross

Heaven and Earth changed in one morning
Mountains and rivers are sad for eternity

On the frontier, seeing my child
Restlessly, the old mother follows

Desolate winds, severe cold is intense
The old body, I fear, can hardly endure<70>

Although not seeking a paradise
One should choose a suitable place to live

The Central Plain suddenly sees warhorses
Southern lands are all flags and banners

Turning aside, grieving the stormy times
Looking back, longing for home

Stars in the Milky Way are still separated
The person in the fragrant chamber has already withered

White sun shines on the Huangp'u
In a black fur coat, seeing you off on your return

Years pass, wandering without stopping
Since parting, how many stars have shifted?

After sending mother back East
Heading South, I lead [?] by the hand

Where is there a bird with a safe nest?
Not a single branch to rely on

The day my parent's letter urged return
Why did your tears wet your chin?

Life and death surely have limits
Human affairs are often disordered

At the riverbank and on the boat
Parting and staying, both are sorrowful

This long poem was sent to Mr./Ms. So-and-so in 1930, the latter half still remains.
This will be continued in the next issue. (Editor)<71>

**Summary**

This poem, "Sulhoe," by Hong Myŏnghŭi is a poignant expression of personal sorrow and hardship, likely reflecting experiences during exile or displacement around 1930. It touches upon themes of separation from family (an aging father, a mother, a child), the harshness of life on the frontier, longing for home and friends, and the pain of parting. The poem also contains broader commentary on the state of the nation ("unclean land," "mountains and rivers are sad") and the turbulent times, referencing war in China ("Central Plain," "Southern lands"). For historians, the poem offers a valuable personal glimpse into the suffering, displacement, and emotional toll experienced by Korean intellectuals or activists during the colonial period, hinting at journeys through Manchuria and China (Frontier, Huangp'u) and reflecting a deep sense of loss and instability.

述懷
						洪命憙
秋風送雁侶
嗈嗈向南飛

片札忽墜前
疾見次復遲

食夫如獲寶
摩*覺移時

懷緖何萬端
憶襲事依稀

三X吾父老
甘心X流離

擧域無乾淨
安土亦瑕疪

子安母庇護
母憐子單*

凄凉X室裡
終朝良友思

草草數行墨
心香陜人肥

形*泥塑坐
心騰駟馬馳

阿里厚氷合
負戴渡白衣

天地一朝變
山河萬古悲

塞上見吾子
栖栖老母隨

荒激寒威劇
老體恐難支<70>

雖不問樂土
居可擇所宜

中原忽戎馬
南國皆旌旗

側身悲風雲
回首戀庭闈

銀漢星猶隔
香閨人己萎

白日照黃浦
黑裘送君歸

歲年遊不住
一別星幾移

送母東歸後
南下我手携

那有安巢鳥
可依無一枝

親詔促歸日
君何淚沾頣

存亡應有限
人事多叅差

江頭與船上
去住兩悽其
