Three Stanzas of Sorrow in Old Music
						Wĭdang Chŏng Inbo

That sound of p'iri and saenghwang,
Long drawn out, intends to rise high,
This and that blend together,
Solemnly, the drum beats along,
Turning back at the swift climax,
It ends as if leaving something behind.
(Right: Chŏnbyeryak - Ritual Music for Presenting Offerings)

That flute held just so,
The drumstick seemingly worn out.
Hands fumbling, embracing the chaejaeng,
Lest perchance a string should sound.
After a while, the sound of the pak clapper comes,
As if having lost a dream.
(Right: Such'ŏn - Music Wishing Longevity Reaching the Heavens)

High and low pitches, lingeringly,
Is it a fine sound? The fine-textured waterside?<230>
Fish and dragons are deep in slumber,
The moon spreads across the vast expanse.
There is nothing to awaken,
Even the mountains seem low.
(Right: Manp'ajŏngsik - Music of Ten Thousand Waves Calmed)<231>
<230-231>

**Summary**

This three-stanza poem by Wĭdang Chŏng Inbo evokes a sense of deep sorrow and loss through descriptions of traditional Korean court music (Chŏnbyeryak, Such'ŏn, Manp'ajŏngsik). Each stanza captures a different mood within the music – solemnity ending abruptly, hesitant anticipation followed by resignation, and finally, a vast, quiet stillness where even nature seems subdued. The poem uses the fading sounds and melancholic atmosphere of ancient melodies to reflect on a sense of ending, lost dreams, and profound quietude. From a historical perspective, the poem is significant as it was written during the Japanese colonial period by a prominent nationalist intellectual. Historians might find it interesting as an expression of cultural lament and suppressed national feeling, using the elegy for traditional court music—symbolic of the lost Joseon dynasty and Korean sovereignty—as a metaphor for the colonial condition and the perceived decline or silencing of Korean identity. The choice of music titles, especially the final "Manp'ajŏngsik" (Ten Thousand Waves Calmed), creates a poignant contrast between the ideal of peace and stability evoked by the music and the likely turbulent reality and inner sorrow felt by Koreans under occupation.
