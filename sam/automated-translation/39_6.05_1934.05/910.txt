At what times, to what places, and how many times a month do you go out with your wife (同夫人 外出)?

Im Pongsun

Although I have nothing special to answer regarding your company's survey question (貴社 設問), if I must force myself to speak:
1. When visiting another family as a family (가족적으로).
2. When going to the bathhouse.
3. Occasionally, when engaging in epicurean pursuits (食道樂) or when receiving an invitation.
Will it be 4 or 5 times (4, 5次) a month? Or maybe not? I'd say.<245>

Cha Sangch'an

My wife and I are not of the status (格) or circumstances (處地) to go out together, so I have never gone out accompanied by my wife (同夫人하고 외출). If I must force myself to say, perhaps going to the Ch'ŏndogyo Church (天道敎堂) every Sunday could be called going out with my wife? However, even that is merely going to the same place (同場所) on the same day (同日); we don't strictly accompany each other like others do. In the future, if I find a good match (佳綠) and meet a wife who suits my heart and is affectionate, I would go out with my wife even daily. Hahaha.<246>

Pang In'gŭn

One. On Sundays, to the Christian Church (禮拜堂).
One. Once a week, the whole family walks on Pugaksan mountain (北岳山).
One. Other than that (其外), as circumstances dictate (隨時應變).<247>

**Summary**

This survey asks three Korean men in 1934 about how often and under what circumstances they go out publicly with their wives. Im Pongsun goes out with his wife 4-5 times a month for family visits, bathing, or special occasions like dining out. Cha Sangch'an states he and his wife are not in a position to go out together formally, though they attend the same church weekly, and humorously expresses hope for a future wife with whom he could go out daily. Pang In'gŭn reports regular Sunday church outings and weekly family mountain walks, plus other occasions as they arise. From a historical perspective, the responses offer insights into the varied practices and attitudes towards marital companionship and the public visibility of couples in colonial Korea. Cha Sangch'an's response, in particular, hints at potential social or economic constraints influencing such practices, while Pang In'gŭn's suggests a more modern, family-centric approach for some.
