Article Type: 시 (Poem)

Yesterday night, the wind opened the peach blossoms by the dew-covered well;
Above the front hall of Weiyang Palace, the moon's disk hung high.

Singers and dancers from Pingyang have newly received favor,
Outside the curtain, feeling the spring cold, she is bestowed a brocade robe.<42>

**Summary**

This article presents a classical Chinese poem, "Song of the Spring Palace" by Wang Changling. The poem depicts a scene in the imperial palace: peach blossoms blooming, the moon high over Weiyang Palace, and a newly favored singer/dancer receiving a brocade robe from the emperor due to the spring chill. It evokes themes of fleeting imperial favor and the luxurious yet potentially cold atmosphere of palace life. For historians studying colonial Korea, the inclusion of a Tang dynasty Chinese poem in a popular Korean magazine like *Samch'ŏlli* in 1934 is noteworthy. It highlights the enduring cultural prestige of classical Chinese literature among the Korean readership, existing alongside emerging modern Korean literature and Japanese cultural influence during the colonial period.
