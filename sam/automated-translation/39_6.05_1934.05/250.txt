Stopping Over in Wŏnsan
						By Yi Chun-gong

Mountains surround like a standing screen, enclosing the bay within,
Cloud shadows and water reflections stretch for ten *ri*.

A belt of pine forest shows infinite green,
The traveler's feelings, truly moved, make him suddenly forget returning home.
<59>

**Summary**

This short classical Chinese poem (Hansi) by Yi Chun-gong describes the scenic beauty of Wŏnsan harbor. The poet observes the mountains encircling the bay, the interplay of clouds and light on the water, and the lush pine forests. The natural beauty captivates the poet, making him momentarily forget his journey and the thought of returning home. For historians, the piece is interesting as an example of traditional literary forms persisting during the colonial era. It focuses purely on aesthetics and personal feeling evoked by a Korean landscape (Wŏnsan, a notable port city), potentially reflecting an apolitical stance or a quiet appreciation of national scenery amidst foreign rule.
