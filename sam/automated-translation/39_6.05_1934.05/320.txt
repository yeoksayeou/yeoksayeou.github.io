Desire is Good
						German Chancellor Hitler-

It is a grave error to rashly try to suppress desire (慾望), calling it base. If there is no desire, there is no improvement in humans. Desire is precisely the propeller of life. Purify base desires and make them into high desires. Expand small desires and make them into great desires. Therein lies the path of humanity's ceaseless improvement and progress.<68>

**Summary**

This short piece, attributed to Adolf Hitler, argues that desire (慾心 or 慾望) is not inherently bad but is the driving force behind human progress and improvement. Instead of suppressing desire, one should purify base desires into noble ones and expand small desires into larger ones, as this is the path to constant advancement. From a historical perspective, the most striking aspect is the attribution of this seemingly philosophical, almost self-help style piece, to Hitler in a Korean magazine during the colonial period (1934). Historians might find it interesting as an example of how international figures, even controversial ones like Hitler early in his chancellorship, were presented or perceived in colonial Korea, and the kinds of messages (even seemingly benign ones like this) attributed to them. It reflects the magazine's attempt to bring international perspectives, however curated or potentially misrepresented, to its Korean readership.

慾心은 조타
						獨逸首相 힛틀러-
욕망을 천하다고 함부로 이것을 抑制하려 하는 것은 심한 錯誤다. 慾望이 업스면 인간에 向上이 업다. 慾望이야말로 생활의 推進機다. 천한 慾望은 淨化하여 놉흔 慾望으로 하라. 적은 慾望은 擴大하여 큰 慾望으로 하라. 거기에 인간의 부단한 向上 進步의 길이 잇는 것이다.<68>
