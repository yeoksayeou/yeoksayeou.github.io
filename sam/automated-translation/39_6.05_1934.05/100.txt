**Body Text Translation**
Divorce Settlement of 35,000 Won
A Curious Lawsuit Has Been Filed

Let's recount the surprising story that a divorce costs 48,000 Won. A 26-year-old woman named Kim Ch'aejang, living in Kaech'ŏn, South P'yŏngan Province, married a young man from the same village named Yi Kunbyŏng. However, after the husband studied abroad in Tokyo and returned, their relationship deteriorated. The husband came to dislike his wife and went to Wŏnsan, where he began living with another woman. Consequently, they unavoidably decided to divorce. The condition at that time was that he would pay her 100 Won each month until she turned 65. This amounts to 48,000 Won for the 40 years after the divorce, but it is said that he has not fulfilled this obligation even once. Recently, she filed a lawsuit in court against her former husband, that young man, seeking 35,000 Won, the amount covering 29 years and 2 months until she turns 55. One wonders how the judgment will turn out.<38>

**Summary**

A woman named Kim Ch'aejang from Kaech'ŏn sued her ex-husband, Yi Kunbyŏng, for failing to pay alimony agreed upon during their divorce. Yi, after returning from studying in Tokyo, left Kim for another woman in Wŏnsan. The divorce agreement stipulated he pay 100 Won monthly until Kim turned 65 (totaling 48,000 Won over 40 years). Having received no payments, Kim is now suing for 35,000 Won, covering the period until she turns 55. The article highlights a significant legal dispute over a large sum of money related to divorce and alimony promises in colonial Korea. Historians might find this case interesting for insights into changing marital norms, the legal recourse available to women regarding divorce settlements, the economic value assigned (35,000-48,000 Won was a fortune), and the social backdrop involving overseas study (Tokyo) and subsequent marital breakdown during the colonial period.
