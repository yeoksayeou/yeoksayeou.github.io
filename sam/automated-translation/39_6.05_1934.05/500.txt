Analysis Table of the Ideal Husband

An unmarried talented woman (未婚才媛), who graduated from a certain Girls' Higher Normal School in the city this spring, wrote down her percentage analysis table for her ideal husband as follows.

1. Property (財産) - If you marry into a poor family, there is much trouble, family love (家庭愛) is easily broken due to difficulties in living, and since a woman whose economic position is weak must consider contingencies (divorce, etc.), one cannot help but prioritize property first in marriage. 60 points

2. Masculine Beauty (男性美) - Like something out of Greek sculpture (希腦彫刻), healthy, with a frame that is imposingly (隆隆히) well-developed, cheerful, dignified, and passionate. 25 points

3. Learning (學識) - For someone living socially in Kyŏngsŏng (京城), it is acceptable (可) as long as they do not excessively stand below others. 15 points

Thus, 100 points are completed.<101>

**Summary**

This short piece presents a "percentage analysis" by a recent female graduate in 1934 Seoul outlining her criteria for an ideal husband. Wealth is overwhelmingly prioritized at 60%, justified by the need for stability and security, especially considering the potential for divorce. Masculine beauty, described with reference to Greek sculpture, accounts for 25%, while academic learning is valued least at 15%, requiring only a level sufficient for social life in Kyŏngsŏng. From a historical perspective, the article offers insight into the marital priorities and pragmatic concerns of an educated urban woman during the Japanese colonial period in Korea. Historians might find the explicit emphasis on economic security over romance or even education, and the specific mention of divorce as a contingency, particularly revealing about social anxieties and the perceived vulnerabilities of women at the time.
