Humanity and Worldly Affairs, Continuing the Prison Diary at Ichigaya Prison
						Yang Kŭnhwan

Once, when I was crossing Hitotsubashi Bridge in Kanda, Tokyo, and walking along the green of the Imperial Palace's outer moat, I suddenly stumbled and the strap (鼻緖) of my geta broke. Stepping onto the stone with one bare foot, I searched my pockets to see if there was anything I could use temporarily, but there was nothing. Having no choice, I took off my hakama, untied the belt (帶), and was about to tear it in half when, at that very moment, a Japanese schoolgirl passing by rushed towards me and said, "Wait a moment, I have something here." She tore the handkerchief (ハンカチ) she was holding in her hand in half and offered it to me, saying, "I just took this out, it's not soiled at all, please use it." I hesitated for a moment, but given the situation, I had no choice but to accept it, saying, "Yes, thank you." Looking at it, it was truly a brand new handkerchief, just taken out, with neat folds, and the scent of perfume strongly hitting my nose. Regardless of its price, high or low, her act of helping someone in sudden difficulty was truly worth a thousand pieces of gold. I was truly grateful from the bottom of my heart. Because we were in the middle of a road with many people watching, I couldn't say anything more than "Thank you," but the more I thought about it later, the more beautiful her spirit was, unhesitatingly tearing her own belonging to offer it to a man she didn't know.
I regretted not having asked for her name and address. Perhaps being asked would have inconvenienced her, but I didn't intend to just receive it and do nothing.
On that same foot, I immediately went to a Western goods store, bought a dozen handkerchiefs similar to that one and a few other cosmetics, went back to the previous spot, and waited for the schoolgirl to return, but she didn't appear even late into the day. I did this for two or three days, but ultimately, I couldn't meet her. I ended up giving them to the daughter at my lodging (下宿) and told her the story. Truly, what is most precious is human compassion (人情).

Heaven, though silent, carries out the procession of the four seasons; Heaven, though unmoved, holds the power of life and death. Time passes relentlessly without mercy, and all things in the universe constantly change through birth, death, <93> rise, and fall. In this situation, I suffered from my crime, felt the impermanence (無常) of things, and had to die moment by moment while still alive. As time passed, I felt myself escaping from sin and approaching a free world, yet amidst the joy, like a child growing day by day from its infancy, what pained and saddened me was the thought that my mother must be growing older day by day. Every time I thought of this, I couldn't help but feel anew the sin of my lack of filial piety. (Omitted) It must be a natural instinct for any human being, from birth, to seek entertainment (娛樂) suited to their character and desire comfort that fits their circumstances. Furthermore, it is the height of human feeling (人情) that everyone prefers beauty and rejects ugliness, desires sweetness and discards bitterness. How much more so in the lonely psychology of unfree people. Many of them, according to their differing spiritual orientations and educational levels, devised appropriate measures of solace for themselves, ceaselessly seeking and drawing enjoyment from something. The most uneducated, those belonging to the lower class, would gather colorful labels with various designs, like those often found on registered trademarks (登錄商標), from somewhere and paste them on the lids of their toolboxes where they could see them, or in places like drawers, finding pleasure in looking at them daily. Others would cut out pictures of children from newspapers or magazines, paste them onto paper to make a booklet, and enjoy flipping through it day after day. Still others would collect chrysanthemum leaves, morning glory flowers, and various other plant leaves and flowers, press them onto paper to dry, and enjoy smelling their fragrance and looking at them. Others would find some kind of tree, morning glory, or other flowers somewhere, plant them in small pots, and enjoy taking them outside and bringing them inside daily. Some found pleasure in breaking the rules by eating sweets or smoking tobacco. Others enjoyed gambling, or telling stories from novels or movies. There were also those who enjoyed having someone compose haiku (俳歌) or Chinese poems (漢詩) for them and learning from them. Others would propose a theme for haiku, distribute it to those who could compose them, <94> set a deadline, and when everyone's poems were gathered, select the best ones (天地人 - Heaven, Earth, Man), copy them along with all the submitted haiku, and circulate them among the poets to read and enjoy. Some sought solace by studying machinery, discussing ideas together, or talking about life problems or matters of faith. Their interests varied greatly, but one thing I saw that truly astonished and amused me was an old man, perhaps around sixty years old, who had somehow obtained two or three one-sen copper coins. Every day, he would put them away and take them out, take them out and put them away, and habitually lift them to his forehead, bowing respectfully and worshipping them. I had often heard talk of many money worshippers in the world, but it was only after coming to prison that I first saw the real thing – someone truly worshipping copper coins. What a tragedy of human life this was!

Inside the prison, those belonging to the intellectual class often enjoyed Chinese poetry (漢詩), but many lamented because they didn't know the rules of composition. Then I, who had some learning in Chinese poetry, arrived, so they were truly pleased and asked for instruction. Thus, I taught everyone willingly to the best of my knowledge. Among them were also people who asked me to teach them Chinese classics (漢學). The Great Learning, the Analects, the other Four Books and Three Classics (四書三經); furthermore, the truly enthusiastic ones even came asking me to teach English, Chinese, and Korean. During break times, I taught these things, and not infrequently, I also gave Bible lectures. And so, completely without distinction between them and me, we opened our hearts to each other, mingled in arts, like teacher and student, like brothers.

Truly, I saw how unfortunate they were. However, how precious is that tender heart that finds joy in looking at registered trademarks, flowers, leaves, and children's pictures; that emotional sensibility which recites and lovingly cherishes poems and songs, yearning for beauty; and that intellectual desire which seeks to broaden one's knowledge by learning something and strives to discover the truth related to it, yearning for truth itself! <95>

**Summary**

This memoir excerpt by Yang Kŭnhwan recounts his experiences, contrasting an act of kindness from a Japanese schoolgirl on the streets of Tokyo with the diverse ways inmates cope with life in Ichigaya Prison. He describes the simple pleasures inmates find, from collecting labels and pictures to tending small plants, as well as more intellectual pursuits like composing poetry (haiku, Chinese poetry), studying languages (including Korean, Chinese, English), philosophy, and religion, which Yang himself helps teach. He reflects on the universality of human longing for comfort, beauty, and knowledge, even in confinement, while also noting the pathos of an old man worshipping copper coins. From a historical perspective, the text offers a glimpse into the life of a Korean intellectual imprisoned in Japan during the colonial period. It reveals inter-ethnic interactions (the Japanese schoolgirl), the cultural and intellectual activities maintained even within prison walls (including the study of Korean), and the shared human condition transcending nationality and circumstance among the inmates, providing valuable insight into prisoner life and consciousness under Japanese rule.
