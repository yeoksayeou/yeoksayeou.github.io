Is Being Born in Korea Fortunate or Unfortunate?
						Kim Ch’ang-je

I have never initially thought about whether being born in Korea (朝鮮) is fortunate or unfortunate. In other words, whether good or bad, since I was born in Korea anyway, my only thought is to love Korea and dedicate myself to Korea. However, if I must speak on it, I consider being born in Korea as fortunate. Just as my own bloodline was not born of nobility, nor born of slaves, isn't it fortunate not to have been born in the powerful nations of Europe or America (歐米强國), nor among the savages of Africa (아푸리까 野蠻)? We have never shed others' blood, nor are we an ignorant and unenlightened people (無知蒙眛 民族). In this sense, I think of it as fortunate.<79>

**Summary**

Kim Ch’ang-je states he doesn't dwell on whether being born Korean is fortunate or unfortunate, accepting his birthplace and dedicating himself to it. However, when pressed, he affirms it as fortunate. He feels lucky not to have been born into powerful, potentially aggressive nations (like those in Europe/America) nor into what he terms "savage" or "ignorant" peoples (like in Africa). He finds contentment in Korea's position as neither an oppressor nor an "unenlightened" nation. From a historical perspective, this article is interesting as it reflects a nuanced viewpoint under Japanese colonial rule. While not expressing overt defiance, the author articulates a sense of national identity and worth by contrasting Korea favorably against both powerful aggressors and perceived "lesser" civilizations, finding a middle ground of dignity. This assertion of Korean identity, even in a comparative and somewhat essentialist manner, would be of interest to historians studying intellectual responses to colonialism.

朝鮮에 태여난 것이 幸福한가 不幸한가
						金昶濟
나는 朝鮮에 태어난 것을 幸福이니 不幸이니 하는 생각은 당초에 해본 적이 없읍니다. 말하자면 좋고 굳고 간에 긔왕 朝鮮에 낫으니 朝鮮을 사랑하고 朝鮮을 위해 바치자는 생각 뿐 이올시다. 그러나 긔어히 말을 하라면 나는 朝鮮에 난 것을 幸이라고 생각합니다. 나 自身의 血綠이 貴族의 자식으로도 태어나지 아니하고 노예의 자식으로도 태어나지 아니한 것처럼 歐米强國에도 태어나지 아니하고 아푸리까 野蠻으로도 태어나지 아니한 것이 얼마나 행복인지요. 우리는 남의 피를 흘린 일도 없고 無知蒙眛한 民族도 아니다. 이 意味에서 나는 幸福으로 생각합니다.<79>
