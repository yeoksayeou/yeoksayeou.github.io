受難揷話 (An Episode of Suffering/Hardship)

In Shimonoseki (下關), in order to keep watch over the station, steamships, and trains, as many as 70 plainclothes detectives (高等刑事) have set up camp and are monitoring figures traveling back and forth to Chosŏn (朝鮮). Once, Representative Pak Ch'un'gŭm (朴春琴氏) traveled from Chosŏn aboard the Pusan-Shimonoseki Ferry (關釜連絡船) and reached Shimonoseki. As soon as he landed on the wharf (埠頭), a detective, not knowing he was a Representative, became greatly angered (大努) and immediately proceeded to escort him away. Just then, a well-known personage (知名의 人士) happened to pass by, saw this, provided an explanation, and got him released. <38>

**Summary**

This short article recounts an incident in Shimonoseki where Pak Ch'un'gŭm, a Korean member of the Japanese Diet, was mistaken for a suspicious person by Japanese plainclothes detectives upon arrival from Korea via the Pusan-Shimonoseki ferry. He was detained until a prominent acquaintance intervened. This anecdote highlights the intense surveillance and suspicion directed towards Koreans traveling between Korea and Japan during the colonial period, demonstrating that even prominent figures could be subject to scrutiny and harassment by the Japanese authorities at key transit points like Shimonoseki. Historians might find it illustrative of the atmosphere of control and the functioning of the Japanese surveillance apparatus targeting Koreans.
