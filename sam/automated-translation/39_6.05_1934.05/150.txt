春江花月夜
						張若虛
春江潮水連海平
海上明月共潮生
灩灩隨波千萬里
何處春江無月明<43>

Spring river tides link the level sea,
Over the sea, the bright moon rises with the tide.
Glistening, following the waves for ten thousand *li*,
Where on the spring river is there no moonlight bright?<43>

**Summary**

This article presents the first four lines of the famous Tang Dynasty Chinese poem "Spring River Flower Moon Night" (春江花月夜) by Zhang Ruoxu (張若虛). The lines depict a scene where the spring river's tide merges with the sea under a rising moon, whose light shimmers across the vast waters, illuminating the entire river landscape. For historians, the inclusion of this classic Chinese poem in a popular Korean magazine like *Samch'ŏlli* during the colonial period highlights the continued influence of and engagement with classical Chinese literature among Korean intellectuals and the reading public, even amidst modernization and Japanese rule. It reflects a cultural space where traditional East Asian aesthetics were still valued and shared.
