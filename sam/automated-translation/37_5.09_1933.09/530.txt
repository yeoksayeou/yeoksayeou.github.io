**Summary**

This short piece provides a basic chronological list of major Korean historical states (Koguryŏ, Paekche, Kara, Silla, Koryŏ, Chosŏn), noting the number of rulers and the duration of each dynasty in years. For historians studying colonial Korea, the article's presence in a popular magazine like *Samch'ŏlli* is interesting. It represents a simple, factual presentation of Korean history, possibly reflecting the limited scope allowed under Japanese censorship, yet still serving to keep a basic outline of national history accessible to the Korean public during that period. The inclusion of Kara (Gaya) as a distinct entity with a specific duration is also noteworthy.
