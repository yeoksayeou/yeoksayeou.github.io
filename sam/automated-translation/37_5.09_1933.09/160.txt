Author: Not specified
Article Type: 회고·수기 (Reminiscence/Memoir)

Immediately after the Sino-Japanese War (日淸戰爭卽後), Pak Yŏnghyo (朴泳孝氏) was living in Chŏngdong (貞洞), Seoul, under the large nameplate "Kŭmnŭng Wi Palace" (錦陵尉宮). Accused of secretly plotting (密謀) the deposition of Queen Min (閔妃 廢位), King Kojong (李太王) ordered his arrest to the then Police Commissioner (警務使), An Hyŏngsu (安炯壽). As An was close to Pak, he conveyed this news to Pak. Greatly alarmed (大驚), Pak Yŏnghyo fled to Japan (日本) with Sin Ŭngjo (申應照) and Yi Kyuwan (李圭完). His attire (行裝) at that time is said to have been: his long hair (장발) cut short (단발), wearing leather shoes (합피), and a straw hat (麥藁帽) resembling one made of wood shavings (대패밥 모자), adopting the appearance of a laborer (노동자 風).<15>

**Summary**

This short anecdote recounts the dramatic escape of Pak Yŏnghyo to Japan immediately following the Sino-Japanese War (1895). Accused of plotting to depose Queen Min, Pak was warned of his impending arrest by the Police Commissioner, An Hyŏngsu, who was a friend. To evade capture, Pak disguised himself as a laborer by cutting his traditional long hair short, wearing leather shoes, and donning a straw hat, before fleeing with two companions. For historians, this piece offers a glimpse into the volatile political situation in late Joseon Korea, the dangers faced by reformers like Pak Yŏnghyo, the interplay of personal loyalties and political intrigue (An Hyŏngsu's warning), and the adoption of disguise and flight to Japan as a means of political survival during a period of increasing turmoil and external influence.
