Author:	孝宗大王
Article Type:	시 (Poem)

The sound of scoffing by the clear river (淸江),
What about it is so laughable
That the full mountain's red and green (滿山紅綠)
Sways and laughs?

Never mind. How many days will the spring wind (春風) last?
Laugh as much as you wish.＜71＞

**Summary**

This short article presents a sijo (a traditional Korean poetic form) attributed to King Hyojong of the Joseon Dynasty. The poem observes nature – a sound by a clear river that seems to make the blooming mountains laugh – and contrasts this apparent merriment with the transient nature of spring. It concludes with a slightly resigned or stoic acceptance, telling nature to laugh while it can. The publication of a poem by a former Korean king in a magazine during the Japanese colonial period is notable. Historians might find it interesting as an example of evoking national heritage and potentially carrying subtle commentary on the fleeting nature of power or circumstances, perhaps resonating with readers living under colonial rule.
