A Memorial for Ch'oe Sŏhae

It has been one year since Ch'oe Sŏhae (崔曙海) passed away. On the occasion of his first death anniversary, various writers residing in the capital intended to hold a memorial service. However, as that time was mid-July, many people had gone to the countryside for summer vacation, so it is said to have been postponed until autumn. Meanwhile, Sŏhae's elderly mother, frail wife, and young children are all said to be living by the Tuman River (豆滿江邊). Has the talented man of his generation closed his eyes lying amidst this tragic scene? <65>

**Summary**

The article reports that a planned memorial service for the writer Ch'oe Sŏhae (崔曙海) on the first anniversary of his death was postponed from mid-July to autumn because many literary figures in Seoul were away for the summer. It concludes by noting the difficult circumstances of his surviving family—his mother, wife, and children—who were living by the Tuman River. For historians, this piece highlights the precarious existence of intellectuals and artists during the colonial period, showing both the community's desire to remember them and the harsh realities faced by their families after their passing.
