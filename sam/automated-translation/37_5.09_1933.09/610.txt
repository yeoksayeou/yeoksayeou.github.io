There is no one who saw the face (낫츨) of Queen Min (閔妃). People like Mr. Chi Sŏgyŏng (池錫永 氏) or Mr. Yun Kyo-jŏng (尹敎定 氏) know the old events (녯날 事蹟) well, but regarding Queen Min's face (얼골), they are somewhat vague.

they merely replied, "In any case (엇재뜬), it seems it was true that her face (얼골) was slightly pockmarked (얼그섯든)." <65>

**Summary**

This short piece from 1933 discusses the appearance of Queen Min (Empress Myeongseong). It notes the difficulty in finding anyone who had actually seen her face and mentions that while figures like Chi Sŏgyŏng and Yun Kyo-jŏng were knowledgeable about historical events, they were vague about her looks, only suggesting that her face might have been slightly pockmarked. For historians, this reflects the lingering mystery and perhaps deliberate obscurity surrounding the Queen's image decades after her assassination, possibly influenced by the political climate of the colonial era where discussion of the late monarchy could be sensitive. It also highlights the reliance on second-hand accounts for descriptions of prominent figures from that time.

閔妃
閔妃의 낫츨 보앗다는 이가 업다, 녯날 事蹟은 池錫永 氏나 尹敎定 氏 등이 잘 알지 만은 閔妃의 얼골에 대하여는 조곰 얼그섯느니라.
하고 대답할 뿐, 엇재뜬 얼골이 조곰 얼그섯든 것만은 사실이엇든 듯. ＜65＞
