An Open Secret Meeting
Since the Sin'ganhoe was dissolved and the Samch'ong (Three Federations) were banned from assembly, it has become difficult to see gatherings or organizations. Amidst this, an organization called the Chungang Chinhŭnghoe (Central Promotion Association) has recently emerged. The promoters include some 60 individuals such as Pak Yŏnghyo, Pak Yŏngch'ŏl, Sin Hŭngu, Han Sangnyong, and so on. However, looking into its substance, it seems 3 or 4 people like Yi Kakkchong, Yi Sanghyŏp, Sŏnu Chŏn, Cho Pyŏngsang, etc., were the very first to propose it and are also holding the reins... This much should reveal the nature of this organization.

The most spectacular part was the election of the chairman. There were two factions here. The merchants and industrialists recommended Mr. Pak Sŭngjik, while the gentlemen? recommended Mr. Yun Ch'iho. In the end, it was decided upon Mr. Yun Ch'iho.

The Chosŏn Ilbo has opened branch offices in Tōkyō and Ōsaka, dispatching Ōsaka business bureau chief Mr. Kim Kibŏm and Tōkyō editorial bureau general manager Mr. Kim Tongjin. The main objective, of course, is soliciting advertisements. Thus, the expense money carried by both gentlemen is said to be around 8,000 Wŏn?

The Chungang Ilbo is currently serializing the life story (列傳) of "Chŏng Man-sŏ," supposedly Chosŏn's number one humorist (諧譃家). The writer, Sŏ Paek (少白), is the pen name of Mr. Yi Kwangu.

It has long been the case that Mr. Kim Sŏngsu has been financially assisting Mr. Chang Tŏksu, who is in America (米國). Even now, he reportedly sends 50 Wŏn monthly to Mr. Tŏksu and 100 Wŏn monthly to his mother (慈堂) in Seoul. Since he is the vice president of the Tong-A Ilbo, one could just say it's an allowance, but it is a difficult thing to keep up without loyalty (義理). (Photo is of Mr. Chang)

Long ago, when Mr. Hŏ Hŏn was studying abroad in Tōkyō, Mr. Yi Kap once sent him either 500 or 300 Wŏn in money (동) to supplement his school expenses. <27>

**Summary**

This news column covers several disparate topics: the formation of a new organization, the Chungang Chinhŭnghoe, led by prominent figures but seemingly controlled by a smaller group, raising questions about its true nature following the dissolution of Sin'ganhoe; the internal politics in choosing its chairman; the Chosŏn Ilbo's expansion into Japan for advertising revenue; the Chungang Ilbo's serialization of a humorist's biography written by Yi Kwangu; Kim Sŏngsu's continued financial support for Chang Tŏksu (Tong-A Ilbo VP) studying in the US; and an anecdote about Yi Kap financially helping Hŏ Hŏn during his studies in Tokyo. For historians, the article offers glimpses into the re-organization of elite Korean civil society under colonial rule after the suppression of nationalist groups like Sin'ganhoe, the internal dynamics and potential pro-Japanese collaborationist leanings (given some names involved in Chungang Chinhŭnghoe), the business operations of major Korean newspapers, and the personal networks and financial support systems among prominent Korean figures.

公然한 秘密集
新幹會는 解消, 三總은 집회금지 이래서 이제는 집회나 단체를 보기 어럽든 중, 요지간에 中央振興會란 단체가 생기엇다, 發起人은 朴泳孝, 朴榮喆, 申興雨, 韓相龍 等等 60여 氏. 그런데 내용을 알고보면 李覺鍾, 李相協
鮮于銓, 曺秉相 等 3, 4人이 가장 몬저 發案하고 또 采配를 잡고 잇는 것인데... 이만하면 이 단체의 성질을 알 것이다.

가장 가관은 이사장의 선거다, 여기에 兩派가 잇섯다, 상공업자들은 朴承稷 氏를 薦하고 신사?들은 尹致昊 氏를 薦하엿다. 이래서 결국 尹致昊氏로 결정.

朝鮮日報는 東京大阪에 支局을 내고, 大阪엔 영업국장 金箕範 氏를 東京에는 편집국 총무 金東進 氏를 派送하엿는바 주요한 목적은 물론 광고 모집. 그래서 交際費로서 兩氏가 携行한 돈이 약 8천원?이나 된다나.

「정만서」라고 朝鮮一의 諧譃家의 列傳을 中央日報에서 싯고 잇는 중인데 筆者少白이라 함은 李寬求 氏의 펜, 빔.

米國 가 잇는 張德秀 氏를 재정적으로 金性洙 氏가 援助하여 왓든지는 오랜데 지금도 德秀 氏에 50圓, 서울 잇는 그의 慈堂깨 100圓式 매월 보내어 준다고. 東亞日報의 부사장이니까 수당이라 하면 그만이나 의리가 업고는 직혀가기 어러운 일.(사진은 張氏)

녯날 許憲氏가 東京留學할 때 한번은 李甲 氏가 學資에 보태쓰라고 동 500원 인가 300원인가 보내주엇더라고. ＜27＞
