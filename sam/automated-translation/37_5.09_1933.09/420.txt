Rats of Britain (英國)

Someone announced that there are currently about 3 million dogs and 40 million rats in Britain (英國). The dogs maybe, but who counted the rats and how?

**Summary**

This article presents a collection of five short, unrelated jokes or humorous anecdotes. They include a witty exchange between a policeman and a driver, clever student responses in history and law classes, a misunderstanding between a doctor and a patient regarding a diet, and a skeptical comment on statistics about rats in Britain. From a historical perspective, these jokes offer a glimpse into the type of lighthearted humor consumed by the Korean public in the 1930s. They reflect common social interactions (law enforcement, education, medicine) and awareness of international figures (Martin Luther) and places (Britain), suggesting a certain level of global consciousness alongside everyday concerns. The humor itself is universal, relying on wordplay, logical twists, and absurdity rather than specific political or social commentary on the colonial situation.
