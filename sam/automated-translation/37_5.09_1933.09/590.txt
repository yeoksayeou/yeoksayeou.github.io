Author: Unspecified
Article Type: 소식 (News/Tidings)

Having gained literary fame with his work "Sŭngbang Pigok" (僧房悲曲 - Tragic Song of the Monk's Room), Mr. Ch'oe Sangdŏk (崔象德), pen name Tokkyŏn (獨鵑), who at one time boasted of his outstanding energy by simultaneously publishing serial works in two or three newspapers and two or three magazines, divorced his wife and remarried. Does he intend to remain silent forever? Recently, he has shown no works. Or perhaps major newspaper companies (大新聞社) are not giving his literary talent (才筆) the opportunity and stage? In any case, it is a regrettable matter. <64>

**Summary**

This news brief expresses concern and regret over the recent literary silence of the once prolific writer Ch'oe Sangdŏk, known by his pen name Tokkyŏn. After achieving fame with "Sŭngbang Pigok" and simultaneously publishing multiple serials, he has stopped producing work following his divorce and remarriage. The article wonders if this silence is intentional or if major newspapers are no longer providing him with opportunities. For historians, this piece offers a glimpse into the literary scene of 1930s colonial Korea, highlighting the public interest in writers' personal lives (divorce, remarriage) and how it was perceived to affect their creative output, as well as hinting at the role major media outlets played in promoting literary careers.
