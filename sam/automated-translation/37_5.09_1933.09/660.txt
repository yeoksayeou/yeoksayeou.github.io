Song In-su

Casting a fishing line in the Ch'angnang,
As I sit on the fishing rock (釣님),
The reflection of the setting sun from the pavilion (臺) on the clear river (淸江),
The sound of rain is even better.

Holding the jade-scaled fish (玉麟) strung on a willow branch (柳枝),
I shall go to Apricot Blossom Village (杏花村).<71>

**Summary**

This short poem, likely a sijo or in a similar traditional form, depicts a scene of leisurely fishing. The speaker sits by the clear Ch'angnang river, enjoying the view of the setting sun and the sound of rain. Having caught a fine fish, described metaphorically as jade-scaled, the speaker decides to head to the symbolically named Apricot Blossom Village. The poem evokes classical East Asian aesthetics of appreciating nature and simple pleasures. From a historical perspective, published in 1933 during the Japanese colonial period, this poem's focus on traditional themes and escapism into nature might reflect a yearning for older cultural values or a retreat from the difficult contemporary reality. Historians might see it as an example of cultural expression that sidesteps direct commentary on colonial conditions by embracing traditional aesthetics.
