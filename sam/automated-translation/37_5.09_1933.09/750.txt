If Only Collection

If only some public-spirited person would provide 1,000 Wŏn in travel expenses to send Mr. Yi Yŏsŏng (李如星), an authority on the problems of weak and small nations, to inspect places like India (印度) and the Philippines (比律賓).

If only some public-spirited person would give 30,000 Wŏn to Mr. Kim Poyŏng (金保榮), an authority on Danish (丁抹) gymnastics, to establish a gymnastics school.

If only some public-spirited person would give 10,000 Wŏn to Mr. Na Un'gyu (羅雲奎) to build a talkie (토-끼) motion picture (活動寫眞) studio (撮影所), he would produce a masterpiece greater than "Arirang" (아리랑).

If only some public-spirited person would step forward to expand Posŏng College (普成專門) a bit more and initiate a movement to establish a people's university.

Frustrating Collection

Why haven't the divorced Mmes. Pak Indŏk (朴仁德), Na Hyesŏk (羅蕙錫), and Ch'oe Ŭisun (崔義順) remarried yet? It's frustrating. Photo is of Mme. Pak Indŏk.

Why do Mmes. Yun Sŏngsang (尹聖相) and Hwang Aesidŏk (黃愛施德) still have no children after several years of marriage? It's frustrating.

Why haven't the three young ladies Yun Sŏngdŏk (尹性悳), Mo Yunsuk (毛允淑), and Kim Chahye (金慈惠) married yet, even though they are past the usual age? It's frustrating. <79>

**Summary**

This short article consists of two parts: "If Only Collection" and "Frustrating Collection." The first part expresses wishes for philanthropic funding for prominent Korean cultural and intellectual figures (Yi Yŏsŏng, Kim Poyŏng, Na Un'gyu) and for the expansion of Posŏng College into a national university, reflecting aspirations for national development in culture, education, and international awareness. The second part voices societal curiosity and perhaps impatience regarding the personal lives of prominent "New Women," questioning why divorced women haven't remarried, why married women haven't had children, and why unmarried women are past the typical marriage age. From a historical perspective, the article is interesting as it reveals both the desire for national self-strengthening through cultural and educational means under colonial rule and the intense public scrutiny faced by educated women who deviated from traditional gender roles or expectations in the 1930s. Historians might find the juxtaposition of national aspirations with gossip about women's private lives revealing of the societal pressures and interests of the time.
