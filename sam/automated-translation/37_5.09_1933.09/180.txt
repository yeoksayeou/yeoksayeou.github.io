Ms. Kim Wŏnju's Trip to Shanghai

Is it true that Ms. Kim Wŏnju (金源珠女史), who went to Shanghai following her lover, is now attending an English school run by a Briton there? It is said that the couple is sometimes seen strolling hand-in-hand along the most bustling Ssuma-ro (四馬路) and Nanking Road (南京路).

Furthermore, with the recent arrival of the couple An Kiyŏng (安基永) and Kim Hyŏnsun (金顯順) in Shanghai, do those people also gather sometimes and sit talking about their homeland (故國)? Anyway, Shanghai used to be an exile zone for political figures (政客) in the old days; has it now become an exile zone for lovers (戀愛人)?

**Summary**

This brief news item reports on the recent activities of Ms. Kim Wŏnju in Shanghai, noting she supposedly followed a lover there, is attending an English school, and is seen publicly with her partner. It also mentions the arrival of another Korean couple, An Kiyŏng and Kim Hyŏnsun, wondering if they meet with Kim Wŏnju to discuss their homeland. The article concludes with a musing that Shanghai, formerly a haven for political exiles, might now be transforming into a refuge for those pursuing romantic relationships. From a historical perspective, the article is interesting as it portrays Shanghai as a destination for Koreans seeking personal freedom or escape during the colonial era, contrasting the traditional image of Shanghai as a center for political exile with a newer image as a place for "love exile." It offers a glimpse into the social lives and perceived motivations of certain Koreans moving abroad in the 1930s.
