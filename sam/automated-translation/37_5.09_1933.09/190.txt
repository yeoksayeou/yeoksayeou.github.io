Entry of Ms. Kim Il-yŏp into Buddhism

After making pilgrimages with marriage proposals (매담) to the homes of three individuals – Yŏnhŭi College Professor (延專敎授) Mr. Yi No-ik (李魯翊氏), Im No-wŏl (林蘆月), a major poet of the Imggwawŏn (林檎園) literary group, and Mr. Kuk Ki-yŏl (鞠琦烈氏) of the Dong-A Ilbo (東亞日報) – Ms. Kim Il-yŏp (金一葉 女史), who recently married Mr. Ha Yun-sil (河允實氏) of Posŏng College (普成高普) and was enjoying her youth, has reportedly gone lately to Sudeok Temple (修德寺), a temple deep in the mountains of Yesan (禮山), South Chungcheong Province (忠南), and is currently engaged in worship (參禮).

There are many people in Tokyo (東京) as well, such as Miki Rofū (三木羅風 - likely 三木露風) and Kon Tōkō (今東光), who escape reality and enter the mountains for spiritual practice (入山修道). However, might Ms. Il-yŏp (一葉氏) be the first in Korea (朝鮮) to take refuge in Buddhism (佛門歸依)? <21>

**Summary**

The article reports that Kim Il-yŏp, a notable female figure known for her connections to intellectuals and recent marriage, has entered Sudeok Temple in Yesan to practice Buddhism. Her decision is contextualized by mentioning similar trends among Japanese figures like Miki Rofū and Kon Tōkō who sought spiritual retreat from modern life. The piece speculates that Kim Il-yŏp might be the first prominent Korean woman to formally enter the Buddhist path in this manner during that time. For historians, this article offers a glimpse into the personal lives and spiritual choices of 'New Women' in colonial Korea, highlighting a path diverging from societal expectations. It also reflects contemporary awareness of parallel trends in Japan regarding disillusionment with modernity and seeking solace in tradition or religion.
