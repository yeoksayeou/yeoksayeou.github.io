Expressing Feelings
						Yu Kilchun
Night in the snowy, windy mountains
Quietly, one couch, books
The host and plum blossoms smile together
Spring colors are in the thatched hut

This verse is a work from November, Meiji 25 (1892) by the pioneer Yu Kilchun (兪吉濬), who, after traveling around Europe and America (歐美) and returning home, hid for 6 years at the house of Mr. Han Kyusŏl (韓圭卨氏) due to government disapproval (忌諱), before being pardoned from his offense. <20>

**Summary**

This article presents a short poem in Classical Chinese titled "Expressing Feelings" (述懷) by Yu Kilchun (兪吉濬), written in November 1892. The poem depicts a quiet scene of scholarly seclusion amidst nature ("Night in the snowy, windy mountains...Spring colors are in the thatched hut"). An accompanying note explains the context: Yu composed this after returning from studies in Europe and America, only to face government suspicion, forcing him into hiding at Han Kyusŏl's home for six years before being pardoned. Historically, this piece is interesting as it captures a moment in the life of a prominent Enlightenment thinker and reformist, Yu Kilchun, highlighting the political dangers faced by early modernizers returning with Western knowledge to late Chosŏn Korea. It reflects both his personal resilience and the political climate of suspicion towards foreign influence and reformist ideas during that period.
