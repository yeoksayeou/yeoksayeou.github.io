Two Topics for the Margin

It is said that certain Imperial appointees to the Central Council (中樞院) have proposed creating a new organization called the Security Party (保安黨) to heighten patriotic thought. But the name "Security Party" (保安黨) is identical to the translated name for the "GPU" [Soviet State Political Directorate, transliterated as 에·베·우], so crack down, crack down!

On the front of the grand white building of the Government-General (總督府), there is neither an address plaque for Kwanghwamun-t'ong Number 1 (光化門通一番地), nor is there a name plaque for the "Chōsen Government-General" (朝鮮總督府). The chief of the jurisdictional Chongno Police Station (所轄鍾路署長) should, according to the Door Plaque Law (門牌法), crack down, crack down! <33>

**Summary**

This short piece offers two pointed satirical criticisms. The first mocks the proposed formation of a pro-colonial "Security Party" (保安黨) by highlighting that its name is the same as the term used for the Soviet secret police (GPU), implying it should be suppressed just like subversive elements. The second criticizes the colonial Government-General building itself for lacking proper address and name plaques, ironically calling on the local police chief to enforce regulations against the seat of colonial power. For historians, the article is interesting as it showcases a subtle form of satirical resistance within colonial-era Korean media, using irony and the colonizer's own logic (law enforcement, anti-communism) to critique pro-Japanese collaborators and the colonial administration's symbols of authority.
