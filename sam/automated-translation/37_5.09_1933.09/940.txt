Barley Field Edge
Namuribŏl, seventy *ri*
In the wide field,
I like the barley field
the best.

Though the skylark comes
it goes back again,
Though the South Wind of April
comes, it goes again,

But T'ansiri, weeding,
once she comes,
doesn't know how to leave
and sings her songs.

Regretting to hear it alone,
if I whistle,
it stops and then connects again,
T'ansiri's song.

Kwibuni
The balsam flowers at Kwibuni's house
have bloomed indeed.
Red, bright red flowers
fill the wall.

Unlike the lily flower,
pretty only in appearance
and lacking substance,
it has affection.

If I dip my hand among the flowers,
just as the balsam dye stains,
Kwibuni too stains
this heart of mine.

Engyarach'a
On the third day of last month,
the sound of "Engyarach'a" was heard,

By the fifteenth of this month,
already a three-story house stands tall.

The old pavilion of Kwanghwamun Gate too
went away to that sound,

Pyŏngnam's shack too
was torn down to that sound.

Engyara Engyara Engyarach'a
You make my eyes wet. <114>

**Summary**

This article presents three short poems styled as folk songs ("Minyojip") by an author named Ch'ojŏk (Grass Flute). The first poem evokes the simple beauty of a barley field and the enduring presence of a singing field worker named T'ansiri. The second uses the imagery of balsam flowers at Kwibuni's house to describe a deep, staining affection, contrasting it with the superficial beauty of lilies. The third poem uses the rhythmic work chant "Engyarach'a" to mark the rapid passage of time and change, noting both construction (a three-story house) and destruction (Kwanghwamun's old pavilion, Pyŏngnam's shack) driven by this relentless progress, ending on a note of melancholy.

From a historical perspective, the poems offer glimpses into rural life and the changing urban landscape during the colonial period. The mention of Kwanghwamun's "old pavilion" potentially alluding to changes or removals near the Gyeongbok Palace area under Japanese rule, juxtaposed with new construction and the demolition of a simple "shack," reflects the complex transformations (both celebrated and lamented) occurring in 1930s Korea. The use of folk song style itself can be seen as an attempt to capture or preserve a sense of traditional Korean sentiment amidst rapid modernization and colonial influence.

民謠集
						草笛
보리밧머리
나무리벌 칠십리
너른 밧 속에
나는야 보리바티
제일 조터라.

종달새는 왓다도
도로 가지만
4월이라 南風도
왓다가지만

김매는 탄실이는
한번 오면은
떠날줄 모르고
노래부르데

혼자듯기 앗가워
휘파람 불면
끈첫다 도로 잇는
탄실이 노래.

貴紛이
貴紛이네 집 봉사 꼿은
피기도 하엿다
빨갓코 샛빨간 꼿
담장에 가득.

모양만 어엽부고
실속이 업는
나리 꼿과 달나서
정이 잇다오.

꼿 속에 손 잠그면
봉사물 들드시
貴紛이도 이 가슴에
물드려 준다오.

엥야라차
지난 달 초 3일에
엥야라차 소리나더니

이 달 보름 날
벌서 삼층 집 서 누나.

광화문 녯다락도
저 소리에 가고

丙南이 집 오막사리도
저 소리에 헐녓네.

엥야라 엥야라 엥야라차
네가 내 눈을 젓게 하누나. ＜114＞
