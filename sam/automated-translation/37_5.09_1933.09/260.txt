At the Courthouse, - A Record from Within Ichigaya Prison -
						Yang Kŭnhwan

Today is my trial date. From early morning, under guard, I leave Ichigaya Prison and head towards the courthouse. Behind the General Staff Headquarters, past Miyakezaka, Akasaka Mitsuke, Yotsuya Mitsuke—the cherry blossoms there have all begun to bloom, truly entering full bloom. At this time, I, handcuffed, bound by rope, and with a woven straw hat placed over my head, peer out through the gaps in the iron mesh of that prison transport vehicle. How can I describe the feeling? Should I say sad? Should I say painful? My chest <28> is just tight and suffocated, with no will to live, almost driven mad. The weather is mild and warm, cherry blossoms float like clouds, people gather like mountains under the trees, birds sing, butterflies dance. At such a time, young girls, like flowers, not content with their own beauty, apply beautification techniques, and further adorn themselves with fine brocade and embroidery, yearning for spring, flirting with the flowers. People view the flowers, the flowers view the people. Seeing this scene while handcuffed, bound at the waist with rope, wearing a ridiculous woven hat on my head, being transported between life and death, peering out from within the arrow-like speeding vehicle—how could my emotions possibly be truly described with pen or words?

Thus, confined alone in a remote corner of the courthouse basement, I trembled with fear, shrinking into myself. The footsteps of many spectators walking on the corridor of the second floor echoed faintly, and the voices of occasional conversations sounded mysterious. In an instant, I glimpsed all the colors of human life, and just sat vacantly, gazing at a single white cloud drifting leisurely in the blue sky visible through the iron bars of the window, feeling my own absence, pitying myself.

Within the premises of the Tokyo District Court, many of my acquaintances and close friends had gathered, rushing to attend my trial. Seeing the prison transport vehicle I was in, they would stop and watch me off with sorrowful expressions. Then, when the time came, as I was tied with a rope and led away, between the courtroom and the corridor, the people who had been scattered along the tramway earlier all gathered together into a crowd. Upon seeing me, my friends showed various expressions—some smiled, some frowned, some held back tears. I simply offered a faint smile to each one. Among them were Korean female students dressed in pure white, who all bowed deeply in respect. Among them, I also saw a young girl who looked to be about twelve or thirteen. I gave a gentle, silent nod. Passing before them, I was struck not only by an indescribable feeling, but their white attire evoked an even deeper sense of pathos. Just like white clothes following a funeral bier during a funeral procession, I couldn't help but feel as if I had died and my compatriots were wearing white to express their condolences. This was because our female students had come to observe, leaving a deep impression. Directly in front, I saw my beloved wife, and beside her, my beloved younger sister, holding my eldest daughter Chŏngja (貞子), also wearing white.

Upon entering the courtroom, it seemed a "Full House" sign was about to be posted. Opposite, on the windows and roofs of the third floor, people had also formed a crowd. Seeing me, they took off their hats and waved, raising their hands high… (Omitted section) I again gave a silent nod. I sat down in the defendant's seat and glanced behind me. The police chief and the officers <29> below him all had their hat straps down, busily maintaining an imposing guard. At the courtroom entrance gate, people formed two lines, creating a commotion as they tried to enter. My wife and my beloved sister were seated in the very front row. My child pointed at me, saying, "Uncle is over there," making everyone laugh. As I looked back, a chief guard came close to my side, seeming to pay attention to my movements. Beside me sat several other defendants. Soon, the defense lawyers entered, followed by the presiding judge and jurors, wearing strange hats resembling cicada shells (蟬殼), like those Confucius (孔子樣) used to wear. Newspaper reporters seemed to be aiming their cameras and taking pictures. My child, unaware that her own father was now consumed by fear and anxiety, dragged before the court on the brink of life or death, innocently pointed and said, "Uncle is over there." That pitiful situation, for the child herself, was fortunate in her ignorance; for me, the father, it was infinitely sad. If she had recognized that her father was now in court facing a life-or-death situation, she wouldn't have been making a fuss about seeing "Uncle." She would surely have grieved more than I, lamented no less than my own parents.

It might be foolish not to know everything, but I felt that there is often happiness to be found in ignorance. On that day, a sentence was passed on a woman. Having lost her husband and facing hardship in life, she had despaired, become pessimistic about the future, and killed her two beloved children. The presiding judge expressed sympathy, saying things like, "Weren't those innocent children pitiful?" with compassionate words, and she seemed to be sentenced to five years' imprisonment. Another was a theft case; after the prosecutor's closing argument, ten years' imprisonment was requested. Yet another was questioned for killing someone as a result of a drunken brawl. Then it was my turn, and I was called before that to stand before the presiding judge.

Presiding Judge: Name?
Me: Yang Kŭnhwan (梁槿煥).
Presiding Judge: Age?
Me: Twenty-eight.
As soon as I finished speaking, a loud voice erupted from the spectator seats behind me. Startled, I turned around to see a distinguished-looking woman, around thirty years old, standing up in the middle of the spectator section, shouting angrily, "Yang Kŭnhwan is..." but I couldn't clearly hear the rest of what she said after "Yang Kŭnhwan." After the woman finished speaking, the presiding judge said, "Alright, I understand. However, if you cause a disturbance in this courtroom now, the judge, the defendant, everyone's mind will be ■ disturbed (■攪亂), leading to errors. So, I will hear the details later separately. Please step outside for a moment." A police officer then seemed to lead the woman outside. It was so sudden, I had no idea what was going on and asked the presiding judge, "What on earth was that?" The presiding judge replied, "I don't know either." Then, my child started crying, letting out a "Wah!" cry, shaking her head as if saying "No, no." That child's cry was like an iron rod striking my chest, tearing at my heart. The louder her cries became, the more painful and heartbroken I felt. In my anguish, I wanted to shout, "Take the child and go home!" But how could I unleash such merciless anger on my pitiful wife? Every time the child cried out "Daddy!", it felt like a needle piercing my heart, my limbs crumbling, as if I wanted to crawl into a crack in the ■ earth (■地). Enduring beyond endurance, I bit my tongue, bearing the pain. The trial <30> proceeded.
Presiding Judge: On the day of the violent act, you went to meet the victim. What did you talk about?
Me: As stated in the preliminary examination.
Presiding Judge: I know that, but please state it again briefly.
Me: First, I went to his room and knocked咚咚 (ton ton) on the door. He opened the door, greeted me saying, "Please come in," and I entered. I said, "I am the Mr. So-and-so (某) who spoke on the phone earlier."
Min (閔): Yes, what business brings you here?
Me: Actually, there is an association named 'So-and-so' (某) organized among the students here in Tokyo, and that association is thinking of holding a welcome reception for you. Would you be able to attend? (This was one method for me to meet him, but holding the meeting was also part of my intention. As I was an officer of that association, it was an easy matter.)
Min: Depending on convenience, it's not impossible that I could attend.
Me: According to the newspapers, it seems you and your party are currently working hard on a certain movement (或運動). Is this a task you are undertaking with full knowledge of what impact it will have on our Chōsen (朝鮮)?
Min: (Glanced up at my face briefly and did not reply, remaining silent.)
Me: In truth, my genuine temperament left no room for asking such things—it should have been decisive. However, if possible, I attempted to clearly hear the truth of the matter and also convey my own thoughts. But he sensed that my question was not ordinary and hesitated to reply. At that moment, I had already taken off my helmet [metaphor for dropping pretense].
(Eleven lines omitted)
I want to hear a little of the truth about what kind of opinions you hold. I asked with earnest sincerity.
(Eighteen lines omitted)
Presiding Judge: Have you ever gone to Chōsen for inspection or similar? What did you think? He started asking things like this.
Me: I haven't done any inspections. It's where I was born and raised.
Presiding Judge: I know that, but have you been there since coming to Tokyo? (Omitted section)
Presiding Judge: Looking at the record, it seems you have quite a close relationship with a certain female student (女學生某). Is there any relationship with that female student?
Me: What do you mean by relationship?
Presiding Judge: A relationship between a man and a woman.
Me: It's not possible to do such bad things with a female student, I replied. Other than that, since the same things questioned in the preliminary examination were repeated, I will omit them here and move on to describe the prosecutor's closing argument and other matters.

Prosecutor's Closing Argument

According to the prosecutor's closing argument: This case is indeed a grave matter that should not be taken lightly. The victim came to Tokyo to strive for the happiness of the Korean people (朝鮮民族), only to be murdered by the defendant. This is not only tragic for the victim, but it is utterly inappropriate and outrageous for the defendant, who is merely a poor student (貧書生), to visit a gentleman who came bearing a vital mission. Furthermore, why did someone who advocates such claims against the government-(Abbreviated)-marry a Japanese woman? Isn't there some hidden reason there? Considering the defendant's character and his long-held ideology, no matter how one thinks about it, there must surely be accomplices and instigators behind him. The preparation of Chinese clothes (支那服), etc.—considering it from any angle, this was a premeditated murder plan from the start. Therefore, according to Article - of the Penal Code, I request the death penalty.
He finished by saying that if such a dangerous individual is not given the ultimate punishment, it will not serve as a warning to others. (Continued in the next issue) <31>

**Summary**

This article is a first-person account by Yang Kŭnhwan, a Korean nationalist, detailing his experience on the day of his trial in Tokyo. He describes the emotional turmoil of being transported to court, the contrasting spring scenery, the supportive presence of Korean friends and students (notably female students in white), his family's reactions, and the courtroom proceedings. He recounts his interrogation by the judge regarding his encounter with the victim (implied to be Min Wŏnsik) and the prosecutor's closing argument demanding the death penalty, portraying Yang as a dangerous ideologue with likely accomplices. The piece vividly captures the defendant's perspective within the Japanese colonial legal system, his feelings of despair mixed with nationalist conviction, and the personal tragedy interwoven with the political act. Historians might find the detailed description of the courtroom atmosphere, the explicit mention of Korean spectator support (especially the symbolism of white clothing), the prosecutor's biased arguments (questioning Yang's Japanese wife, assuming conspiracy), and Yang's own justification (or lack thereof presented here) for his actions valuable for understanding Korean nationalist activities in Japan, the functioning of the colonial justice system, and the personal experiences of individuals caught within major historical events.
