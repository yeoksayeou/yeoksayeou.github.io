美人前
						梁槿煥

昔日鐵窓靑衣人
今夜勸酒美人前
聽歌見舞一杯裏
十年苦役盡忘辰 ＜15＞

Before a Beauty
						Yang Kŭnhwan

Yesterday, a man in blue prison garb behind iron bars;
Tonight, urged to drink before a beautiful woman.
Listening to songs, watching dances, within a single cup,
The ten years of hard labor are completely forgotten at this moment. <15>

四時二首

春風吹日暖 花開滿故枝
夏雨穀潤足 萬物自榮時
秋霜落葉盡 明月照寂輝
冬雪萬山積 歲寒日色徹 ＜15＞

Four Seasons, Two Poems

Spring wind blows, the day is warm; flowers bloom fully on old branches.
Summer rain moistens the grain sufficiently; it is the time when all things flourish naturally.
Autumn frost, fallen leaves are gone; the bright moon shines with lonely brilliance.
Winter snow piles on myriad mountains; in the year's cold, the sunlight pierces through. <15>

明月虫咽苦 秋懷感慨多
夜長霜雪重 冬想急還家.

Same [Topic: Four Seasons]

Flowers bloom, grass grows lushly; a clear spring day stirs tangled hemp [confused feelings].
Thunder roars, misty rain sprinkles; the summer heart sinks and floats on waves [turbulent emotions].
Bright moon, insects cry bitterly; autumn sentiments are full of deep emotion.
Nights are long, frost and snow are heavy; winter thoughts urgently turn to returning home.

歸耕歸耕後半生 廘世興亡忘歸耕
誰喜身殺如犬死 人心皆欲萬壽寧

Seven Rhymes on Forgetting to Return and Farming

Return to farming, return to farming for the latter half of life;
The rise and fall of the deer world (turbulent world?), forget it and return to farming.
Who delights in being killed like a dog?
Everyone's heart desires long life and peace.
(Following 4 stanzas omitted - original text) <16>

**Summary**

This collection presents four short poems by Yang Kŭnhwan in classical Chinese style (Hanmun). The first, "Before a Beauty," starkly contrasts the hardship of past imprisonment ("ten years of hard labor") with a fleeting moment of pleasure. The next two poems depict the four seasons, evoking corresponding moods and natural imagery. The final poem fragment expresses a desire to retreat from the turbulent world ("deer world") and find peace in farming during the latter half of life. From a historical perspective, the first poem is most revealing, offering a personal glimpse into the life of a former political prisoner (Yang was an independence activist) enjoying a moment of freedom in colonial Korea. The expressed desire to retreat to farming might reflect weariness or disillusionment with the political situation or activism.
