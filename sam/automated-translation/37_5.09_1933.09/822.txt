To All Readers Throughout the World,

There have been more than one or two regrettable incidents due to several misfortunes that "Samch'ŏlli," which you have warmly cherished, has experienced recently, for which we are deeply sorry. However, we have now decisively carried out major reforms, and starting from this month, as you can see, the content and appearance have been completely renewed. We will be sure to publish on schedule every month, so while we ask for your utmost support going forward, we also ask for your sincere help regarding the following two points:

1. If there is not yet a branch office (支社) in your esteemed region, please endeavor to establish one. There is a regulation offering special discounts for groups of ten or more, so interested individuals, please request the regulations.

2. We ask that each of you kindly persuade just one person you know to become a reader of Samch'ŏlli.

Respectfully submitted by the Samch'ŏlli Company, Kyŏngsŏng <93>

**Summary**

This is an announcement from the Samch'ŏlli Company, publisher of the magazine "Samch'ŏlli," addressed to its readers. It apologizes for past irregularities and announces significant reforms to the magazine's content and appearance, promising regular publication starting with the current issue (September 1933). It earnestly requests readers' continued support, specifically asking them to help establish local branch offices and recruit at least one new subscriber each. For historians, this piece reveals the operational challenges faced by a Korean-language publication during the colonial period, its efforts to modernize and expand its reach through reader engagement (branch offices, subscriber drives), and the direct, somewhat formal communication style used between publishers and readers at the time. It highlights the reliance on reader loyalty and grassroots support for survival and growth.
