**Body Text Translation:**
Dr. Yi's Travelogue

When the remains (遺骸) of Dr. Yi (李博士), who suddenly passed away on the Ch'ŏngjin Coast (淸津海岸), arrived at Ch'ŏngnyangni (淸凉里) on the morning of August 16th, Messrs. Chŏng In-bo (鄭寅普), Hong Myŏng-hŭi (洪命憙), Yu Chin-t'ae (兪鎭泰), Pyŏn Yŏng-no (卞榮魯), Yŏ Un-hong (呂運弘), and others who went out to attend the farewell ceremony gathered and talked about the deceased. According to what was heard, in the travelogue Dr. Yi last wrote, there were passages like "the story of looking into someone else's house of mourning" and "The Wŏnsan (元山) sea is too dirty, this body cannot be submerged in it." Thinking about it now, they said there were many phrases that were strangely coincidental. Could this merely be coincidence? <36>

**Summary**

This short piece describes a gathering of prominent Korean intellectuals (Chŏng In-bo, Hong Myŏng-hŭi, etc.) attending the arrival of the remains of a certain "Dr. Yi" in August 1933. They reminisce about his final travelogue, noting seemingly premonitory passages about visiting a house of mourning and finding the Wŏnsan sea too dirty to enter, which felt eerily significant after his sudden death. For historians, the article offers a glimpse into the intellectual circles of colonial Korea, their shared grief, and how they interpreted personal writings, possibly finding subtle reflections of the era's atmosphere or veiled commentary within them. The specific mention of these intellectuals gathering highlights their network and shared sentiments during a difficult period.
