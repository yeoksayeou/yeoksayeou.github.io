The newspaper world, which had been shaky for a long time, has now stabilized. It is delightful that not only have all three newspapers opened their doors, but they are all operating with considerable funds. Some had said that the Chungang Ilbo (中央日報) would find it difficult to survive the summer, but on the contrary, it grows stronger day by day (愈往愈健).

Why did Mr. Cho Mansik (曺晩植) of the Chosŏn Ilbo (朝報) quit as president? In today's world, it is common practice to often act like a robot (로봇트노름) if one lacks the backing of financial power (金權), but did the noble and straightforward (高潔直情) Mr. Cho feel something about this? He is resting quietly in Sŏgyŏng (西京), and in his place, Mr. Pang Ŭngmo (方應模) has become president. As if to say, "What is there to hesitate about in a newspaper company run with one's own money?" he has now shed his mask and stepped forward. Mr. Pang is an outsider (野人) when it comes to cultural enterprises. It would be nice if he could spend money exhilaratingly and operate daringly in the newspaper world in an unconventional manner (無軌道式으로), like Noma Seiji (野間淸治) or Itō Hanji (伊東阪二).

It is said that the Man-Mong Ilbo (滿蒙日報) will begin publication in Sinkyŏng (新京) starting August 15th. Are they planning to welcome Mr. Yi Sanghyŏp (李相協) as editor-in-chief (主幹)?

An Chaehong (安在鴻) and Yi Sŭngbok (李昇馥), having served their sentences (形), are expected to be released from prison this autumn. Whether they will set foot (投足) in the newspaper world once again is an interesting question. (Photo is of Mr. Ch'oe Rin (崔麟))
There was a rumor that the new president of the Chosŏn Ilbo would emerge from among Messrs. Ch'oe Rin (崔麟), Hŏ Hŏn (許憲), and Hong Myŏnghŭi (洪命憙), but with Mr. Pang's own promotion (自身昇任), it seems to be a case of 'heaven is uneventful, earth is uneventful' (天無事, 地無事格). <29>

**Summary**

This news brief from September 1933 discusses the stabilization of the Korean newspaper scene in Seoul, with three major papers operating. It highlights the resignation of Cho Mansik as president of the Chosŏn Ilbo, possibly due to financial pressures, and his replacement by the owner, Pang Ŭngmo, who is encouraged to be bold like Japanese media tycoons. The article also notes the upcoming launch of the Man-Mong Ilbo newspaper in Hsinking (Manchukuo) and anticipates the release from prison of journalists An Chaehong and Yi Sŭngbok, speculating on their future in the media. For historians, this article offers insights into the precarious yet active state of Korean journalism under Japanese rule, the influence of capital (Pang Ŭngmo taking over Chosŏn Ilbo), the expansion of media into Manchukuo (Man-Mong Ilbo), and the fates of prominent nationalist figures involved in media who faced imprisonment (An Chaehong, Yi Sŭngbok).

新聞夜話
오래동안 어성터성 하든 신문계가 이제는 자리를 잡엇다, 세 신문이 모다 開門하엿슬 뿐더러 모다 상당한 자금을 擁하고 활약하는 터으로 유쾌한 일이다, 일부에선 中央日報가 여름을 넘기기 어러우리라고 하더니 오히려 愈往愈健.

朝報의 曺晩植 氏는 엇재 사장을 그만두엇는고, 지금 세상에 金權의 배경이 업스면 흔히 로봇트노름 하는 것이 상례지만, 高潔直情인 氏는 이에 感함이 잇섯든가, 고요히 西京에 安臥하엿고, 그 代로 方應模氏 社長이 되엿다, 제 돈 가지고 하는 신문사에 꺼리낄 것 잇느냐 하드시 이제는 覆面을 벗고 나섯다, 方氏는 문화사업엔 野人이라, 野間淸治, 伊東阪二 모양으로 돈을 통쾌하게 쓰며 대담하게 신문계를 無軌道式으로, 활약하여 주엇스면 조켓다.

滿蒙日報가 新京서 8월 15일부터 발간된다고 한다, 李相協 氏를 主幹으로 마즐 작정이라든가.

安在鴻, 李昇馥 兩人은 形을 마치고 今秋에 출옥 하리라는데 또다시 신문계에 投足하려 할는지 흥미잇는 문제.(사진은 崔麟 氏)
朝鮮日報의 新社長은 崔麟, 許憲, 洪命憙의 3氏 중에서 출마하리란 說이 잇더니 方氏 自身昇任으로 天無事, 地無事格. ＜29＞
