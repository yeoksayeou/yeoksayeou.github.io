When will Chungdong School become a university and resolve Mr. Ch'oe Kyudong's lifelong regret? (Photo is of Mr. Hong Myŏnghŭi)

Although he formerly served even as the Chairman of the Great Korean Association (大韓協會), today Mr. Yun Hyojŏng is caring for his aged body (老體) in the Ok'indong nursing home in Seoul. Is there no one willing to take him in as an adopted son [and care for him]?

Mr. Hong Myŏnghŭi is writing the *Im Kkŏkchŏng Chŏn* (林巨正傳) every morning in that cramped room, but if Mr. Hong Kimun were just a little more filial, he would have let him write at some temple.

When will Mr. Song Chinu grow a beard? He should apply some hair-growth tonic and become a bearded gentleman (有髥丈夫).<23>

**Summary**

This short piece consists of four brief, almost gossip-like entries expressing wishes or concerns about prominent Korean figures of the time: the desire for Chungdong School to become a university for its founder Ch'oe Kyudong, the lonely state of former politician Yun Hyojŏng in a nursing home, the cramped writing conditions of novelist Hong Myŏnghŭi (with a slight jab at his son), and a humorous wish for politician Song Chinu to grow a beard. From a historical perspective, the article offers a snapshot of the personal circumstances and public perceptions surrounding notable intellectuals and leaders during the Japanese colonial period. Historians might find interest in the mention of specific figures like Yun Hyojŏng (former head of Taehan Hyŏphoe) living in reduced circumstances, the aspirations for Korean educational institutions like Chungdong School, and the cultural commentary, even in jest, on figures like Song Chinu.
