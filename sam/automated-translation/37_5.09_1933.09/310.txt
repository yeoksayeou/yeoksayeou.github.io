Article Type: 시 (Poem)

When pear blossom rain (梨花雨) scattered,
The love I tearfully held onto and parted from—
Amidst the autumn wind and falling leaves (秋風落葉), does that person
Also think of me?
Only lonely dreams across a thousand ri (千里)
Come and go. <31>

**Summary**

This short poem by Kye Rang expresses a deep sense of longing and sorrow following separation from a loved one. The speaker recalls parting amidst falling pear blossoms (spring) and wonders if the loved one thinks of them now in autumn, amidst falling leaves. The vast distance separating them allows only lonely dreams to bridge the gap. From a historical perspective, the poem is interesting as an example of personal lyrical expression, particularly potentially by a woman (judging by the name Kye Rang, often associated with a famous kisaeng poet), using traditional Korean natural imagery (pear blossoms, autumn leaves) during the Japanese colonial period. It reflects the endurance of classic poetic themes and sentiments even under colonial rule.
