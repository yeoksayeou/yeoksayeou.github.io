風紀 (Public Morals)

A certain educator from Chosŏn went to America (米國) and asked a girls' school principal, "Is it true that 87% of American female students are not virgins?"

She replied, "No, it's not quite that severe, but it seems about 60% have lost their purity (純潔性)."
Indeed, the state of public morals among American female students is deplorable.

Women only remember the times they suffered misfortune because of men, and men only remember the times they received happiness from women.

A guest entered an inn and lay down, and rainwater dripped steadily from the ceiling. Startled, he asked the servant (使喚):
"Hey, does your house always leak?"
"No, sir, only when it rains."

Ho! You paid 10 Wŏn for a watch like this? No, I paid 3 Wŏn for it, and 7 Wŏn was spent on repairs.<105>

**Summary**

This short miscellany piece from 1933 includes four brief, unrelated items: an anecdote expressing shock at the reported lack of "purity" among American female students, a generalization about how men and women remember past relationships differently, a simple joke about a leaky inn roof, and another joke about the cost of a watch versus its repair fees. From a historical perspective, the article is interesting as it reflects contemporary Korean views (or anxieties) about Western (specifically American) social mores, particularly regarding female chastity, contrasting them implicitly or explicitly with perceived Korean norms. It also showcases gender stereotypes prevalent at the time and includes simple, everyday humor typical of magazine filler content during the colonial period.

風紀
조선의 엇든 교육자가 米國가서 女學校長에게 아메리까 여학생은 8割7分이나 처녀가 아니라니 사실이여요?
하고 무른즉 그는
「아녀요, 그러케는 심하지 안치만 약 6割은 純潔性을 이른 듯 해요.」
하고 대답하더란다. 실로 미국여학생의 風紀는 可歎할 일.

여자는 남자에게 불행을 당하든 때 일만 기억하고, 남자는 여자에게 행복을 밧든 때 일만 기억한다.

여관에 손님이 들어가 누으니 천정에서 빗물이 뚝뚝 떠러진다, 놀나서 使喚에게
「얘 너의 집은 늘 비가 새느냐?」
「아녀요, 비올 때만 새어요.」

호! 이 따위 시계를 10원이나 주엇서? 아니야 주기는 3원 주고 수선비에 7원이 걸렷서.＜105＞
