Article Title: 託兒所 百十個所 (One Hundred Ten Daycare Centers)
Author: Not specified
Article Type: 잡저 (Miscellaneous article/report)

Rural daycare centers (농촌탁아소), which for a while had practically become a slogan of the Kŭnuhwoe (槿友會) with individuals like Chŏng Ch'ilsŏng (丁七星) and Chŏng Chongmyŏng (鄭鍾鳴) advocating for them, have recently been established in various places at an extraordinary speed. Consequently, while there were only a few locations until this spring, perhaps due to the sudden realization of their necessity during the busy farming season, they have sprung up here and there, and according to a recent survey, their number has reached a high total of 110 locations.

It seems likely they will increase significantly more in the future, and it is said that the Government-General (총독부) plans to provide some subsidies for daycare centers and expand them on a large scale, so it appears that daycare centers will proliferate throughout the rural villages of Chosŏn (朝鮮農村各處). <37>

**Summary**

This short article reports on the rapid increase in the number of rural daycare centers (託兒所) in Korea, growing from just a few in the spring of 1933 to 110 by the time of the report in September. It mentions the prior advocacy for these centers by activists associated with the Kŭnuhwoe, such as Chŏng Ch'ilsŏng and Chŏng Chongmyŏng. The article anticipates further growth, noting the Government-General's plan to provide subsidies and promote large-scale expansion. For historians, the article highlights the confluence of Korean women's activism (Kŭnuhwoe) and colonial state policy in addressing rural social needs (childcare during peak farming season). It also points to the colonial government's increasing involvement in rural social infrastructure, potentially for reasons of social control, productivity, or assimilation.

託兒所 百十個所
한동안 槿友會의 슬로-깐이 되다시피 丁七星, 鄭鍾鳴 등이 부르짓든 농촌탁아소는 최근에 비상한 속도로 각처에 설치되고 잇다. 그래서 금년 봄까지는 數個所에 불과하든 것이 농번기에 필요를 갑작히 늣기엇슴인지 이 곳 저 곳에 작고 느러서 최근 조사에는 그 수가 110個所의 多數에 달하엿다, 아마 今後에도 훨신 더 증가될 듯하다는데 탁아소에 대하여는 얼마씩의 보조금을 총독부에서 주어서 대대적으로 확장할 방침이라고 하니 朝鮮農村各處에는 탁아소가 격증되리라고 보여진다. ＜37＞
