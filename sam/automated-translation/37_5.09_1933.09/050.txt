Expressing Thoughts/Feelings
						Ch'oe Rin

Movement and stillness are originally both empty;
Flowers bloom and leaves fall, not because of the wind.
Why is it so hard to let go of the hand clinging to the cliff?
Thus, I deliberately make my life entrusted to a dream.
<14>

**Summary**

The poem by Ch'oe Rin expresses a sense of philosophical resignation, drawing on Buddhist or Daoist ideas. It posits that action and inaction (movement and stillness), life and death (blooming flowers and falling leaves) are fundamentally empty and occur naturally, not driven by external forces like the wind. Despite this understanding, the poet confesses the difficulty of detachment, metaphorically struggling to let go of a hand clinging to a cliff. Ultimately, the poet resolves to live life consciously as if in a dream, entrusting their existence to this illusory state. From a historical perspective, this poem is interesting as Ch'oe Rin was a complex figure who transitioned from nationalist activities to collaboration. Written in 1933, the poem might reflect his internal conflict, disillusionment, or an attempt to rationalize his choices through a philosophy of detachment, offering historians insight into the psychological pressures and coping mechanisms of individuals navigating the complexities of colonial rule.
