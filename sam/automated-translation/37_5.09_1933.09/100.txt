Azaleas
						Sowŏl

When you leave,
Weary of seeing me,
I will gently let you go without a word.

Azaleas
From Yaksan (藥山) in Yŏngbyŏn (寧邊),
I will gather an armful and scatter them on your path.

Step by step,
Upon the flowers laid before you,
Tread lightly, softly, and go.

When you leave,
Weary of seeing me,
Though I die, I shall not shed tears. <18>

**Summary**

This poem, "Azaleas" (진달내 꼿), by Sowŏl (Kim Sowŏl's pen name), expresses the sorrow of parting through a speaker who passively accepts being left by a loved one. The speaker promises to suppress outward signs of grief, offering instead a beautiful, almost ritualistic farewell by scattering azaleas on the departing lover's path, inviting them to tread upon the flowers. The final line reveals the depth of suppressed emotion, stating that even in death, no tears will be shed, implying immense inner pain masked by resignation. For historians, this poem, written during the Japanese colonial period, is significant as one of the most beloved modern Korean poems. Its themes of sorrow, endurance, and passive resistance (expressed through suppressed grief rather than active defiance) are often interpreted as reflecting the collective sentiments (han - 한) of the Korean people under occupation, making it a powerful cultural artifact from that era.

진달내 꼿
						素月
나 보기가 역겨워
가실 때에는
말 업시 고히 보내드리우리다.
寧邊에 樂山
진달래 꼿
아름따다 가실 길에 뿌리우리다.
가시는 거름 거름
노힌 그 꼿츨
삽분히 즈려밟고 가시옵소서.
나 보기가 역겨워
가실 때에는
죽어도 눈물 흘니우리다. ＜18＞
