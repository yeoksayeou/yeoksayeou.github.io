李舜臣

On Hansan Island, on a moonlit night,
Sitting alone on the watchtower,
With a great sword worn at my side,
Deep in sorrowful thought,

Whence comes the single sound of a Tartar pipe (一聲胡茄)?
It pierces one's heart. <30>

**Summary**

This article presents a famous Korean *sijo* (classical poem) attributed to Admiral Yi Sunsin (李舜臣). The poem describes a moment of solitary reflection on a moonlit night at a watchtower on Hansan Island. Burdened with deep worries and armed with his sword, the admiral hears the mournful sound of a pipe (胡茄) which cuts deeply into his heart, reflecting his concerns for the nation. The publication of this poem attributed to a national hero famed for fighting off Japanese invasion, in a Korean magazine during the Japanese colonial period (1933), is significant. It could represent a subtle form of cultural resistance or nationalist expression, invoking a powerful symbol of Korean resilience and patriotism for contemporary readers. Historians might see it as an example of how national narratives and historical figures were utilized within the colonial context.
