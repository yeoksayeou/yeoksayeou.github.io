Kim Ansŏ's Apartment Life
Poet Mr. Kim Ansŏ (金岸曙) sent his wife and young baby down to Chinnamp'o (鎭南浦) and recently moved into an apartment in Kwansudong (觀水洞), where he is said to be busy writing poetry. By the way, word has it that while there are many Japanese-run "apartments" in Seoul, this is the only one run by a Korean.

Hyŏn P'ing'hŏ's Silence
Is the talented man of his generation, P'ing'hŏ (憑虛), perhaps hard-pressed by worldly affairs? Lately, he has not put out any works. Although he has been employed at the *Tonga Ilbo* (東亞日報) for 10 years, he has never yet put his pen to a serialized novel for the *Tonga* paper. Does he not know that the world eagerly awaits him writing a full-length novel? <71>

**Summary**

This news section reports on two literary figures. Poet Kim Ansŏ has moved into a Seoul apartment alone to focus on his writing, sending his family to Chinnamp'o. Notably, his apartment is mentioned as possibly the only Korean-run one in Seoul, with most being Japanese-operated. The second note expresses anticipation for the writer Hyŏn P'ing'hŏ, known for his talent but currently inactive in publishing, to write a full-length novel, despite his long tenure at the *Tonga Ilbo* newspaper. From a historical perspective, the article offers a glimpse into the lives of Korean intellectuals under Japanese rule, highlighting the scarcity of Korean-owned businesses like apartments in the capital and the cultural expectations placed upon prominent writers associated with major Korean newspapers.

金岸曙의 아파-트 生活
金岸曙의 아파-트 生活
詩人 金岸曙氏는 부인과 어린 애기를 鎭南浦에 내려보내고, 최근은 觀水洞의 아파-트멘트에 이주하여 詩作에 분주하는 중이라고. 그런데 듯건대 서울에는 日本人 經營의 「아파-트멘트」는 만흐나 조선사람 경영은 이 한 곳뿐이라든가.

玄憑虛의 沈黙
一代의 才人 憑虛는 世俗雜務에 쪼들니는 셈인가. 근래에는 작품이라고 아니내어 놋는다, 東亞日報에 재직 10년이건만, 일즉 東亞紙의 연재소설에 붓을 대어 본 적이 업다, 세상에서는 氏가 장편소설을 쓰기를 고대하는 줄 모름인가.＜71＞
