Article Title: 玉觀彬氏의 豪語 (Ok Kwanbin's Bold Words/Arrogant Talk)
Author: (Not specified)
Article Type: 소식 (News/Tidbit)

Mr. Ok Kwanbin (玉觀彬) of Shanghai has been assassinated. He was once under An Ch'angho (安昌浩), doing much work, but he withdrew from political circles and engaged in business for 10 years now, managing the Samdŏk Yanghaeng (三德洋行) after obtaining the exclusive Eastern (東洋) sales patent for German (獨逸) chemical pharmaceuticals, achieving a great fortune of over 1 million *won*. When people occasionally went to ask for funds for the [independence] movement, he reportedly refused them all, saying, "Will you work for just this much? I also have a purpose in earning money." This is said to be the main reason for the resentment leading to his murder (含怨被殺). <17>

**Summary**

This news brief reports the assassination of Ok Kwanbin in Shanghai. It notes his past involvement in the independence movement under An Ch'angho before transitioning to business, where he amassed considerable wealth through his company, Samdŏk Yanghaeng, which held exclusive rights for German chemicals. The article suggests the primary motive for his murder was resentment stemming from his alleged refusal to provide funds to independence activists, quoting his purported justification that he too had a purpose in earning money. From a historical perspective, this piece is interesting as it highlights the complex internal dynamics, including financial tensions and potential ideological clashes, within the Korean independence movement operating in exile, particularly in Shanghai. It touches upon the difficult choices faced by individuals between direct activism and pursuing economic stability or success, and how such choices could lead to fatal conflicts.
