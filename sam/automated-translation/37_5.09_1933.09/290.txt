Article Title: [이 몸이 죽고 죽어…] (This body dies and dies...)
Author: 鄭夢周
Article Type: 시 (Poem)

Though this body dies and dies,
Though it dies again a hundred times,
My white bones become dust and earth,
Whether my soul exists or not,

My single-minded devotion toward my lord,
How could it possibly change? <30>

**Summary**

This article presents the famous Korean *sijo* (classical poem) known as *Dansimga* by the late Koryŏ Dynasty loyalist Chŏng Mong-ju. The poem expresses unwavering loyalty to his lord (the Koryŏ king) even in the face of death and the decay of his physical body. Its publication in a 1930s colonial-era magazine is notable. While possibly presented merely as a piece of classical literature, its theme of enduring loyalty despite adversity could have resonated with contemporary readers as a subtle expression of Korean national identity and resistance against Japanese rule, using historical allegory. Historians might find its inclusion significant for understanding how cultural heritage was curated and potentially interpreted under colonial censorship.
