Travel Expenses for a Trip Around the World

The person who has traveled most often from Korea (朝鮮) to the West is Mr. Sin Hŭngu (申興雨氏). He has probably traveled back and forth to America (米國) 7 or 8 times and to Europe (歐羅巴) 2 or 3 times, but his travel expenses were mostly borne by the "Christian Church (기독교회)". Besides him, those who have traveled around the world using their private funds include Mr. Ch'oe Rin (崔麟), Mr. Hŏ Hŏn (許憲), and Mr. Kim Sŏngsu (金性洙). It is said that Mr. Ch'oe Rin spent 16,000 wŏn, Mr. Hŏ Hŏn spent 20,000 wŏn as he took his daughter Chŏngsuk (貞淑氏) to America with him, and Mr. Kim Sŏngsu spent approximately 23,000 wŏn, which included treatment for a nose ailment. It is generally said that it will likely cost more now due to exchange rate relations. <56>

**Summary**

This short article discusses the high costs of international travel, specifically trips around the world, for prominent Koreans in the early 1930s. It names Sin Hŭngu as the most frequent traveler to the West, whose trips were funded by the Christian Church. It contrasts this with Ch'oe Rin, Hŏ Hŏn (who traveled with his daughter), and Kim Sŏngsu, who funded their global travels privately, spending between 16,000 and 23,000 wŏn. The piece concludes by noting that costs were expected to rise due to currency exchange rates. For historians, this text offers a glimpse into the economic capacity and international mobility of certain elite Koreans during the colonial period, highlighting the significant personal expense involved in such travel compared to institutionally funded trips. It also mentions specific prominent figures and their reasons for travel (implied or explicit, like Kim Sŏngsu's medical treatment), reflecting aspects of colonial Korean society and its connections to the wider world.
