New Year's Address
						Governor-General of Korea, Minami Jirō

Only the Peninsula [Korea], having received blessings with brilliance, sees its public order stabilized, its industry improving step by step, various manufacturing industries burgeoning, and consequently, trade progressing smoothly, with a promising future ahead. Thus, we earnestly hope to receive Heaven's blessings henceforth as well and require further effort.

Since my arrival, I have particularly advocated for "Korea and Manchuria as One Body" (鮮滿一如) and have made this the guiding principle of my administration. Accordingly, having felt the need to confer with the highest leadership of Manchukuo previously, we met in Tumŏn, and thereupon, we are in the midst of implementing various measures in the spirit of "Korea and Manchuria as One Body." For example, the construction of bridges on the Korea-Manchuria border, intended more as conduits for culture and industry than merely marking a border, saw its signing completed in this spirit. Also, the opening of the railway between Chiamussu (참스) and Najin is, in this sense, meant to forge close economic ties between Korea and Manchuria. To widely advance Korean products and their processed goods into Manchuria, discussions are underway with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (商工省) to establish various facilities in Harbin, as well as Mudanjiang, Pongch'ŏn (奉天), and other locations, and Manchukuo has agreed to provide conveniences for this. Furthermore, as the politics of a nation develop various facilities once public order is secured, an agreement between the Police Affairs Bureau (警務局) and Manchukuo has been reached to establish public order in the mutually dependent nations of Korea and Manchuria. Additionally, since the abundant water volume of the Amnok River can naturally generate electricity, discussions are currently underway for both Korea and Manchuria to utilize this, and this too will likely be realized soon. Regarding the important issue of migration, a general outline has also been agreed upon between the two parties. However, since the effects of these matters are to be anticipated in the future, all that is required is diligent effort. In the coming New Year, the people must resolve to break through the many difficulties with even greater national unity, and I earnestly hope this determined spirit will be demonstrated. As we bid farewell to this year of many difficulties, we urge awakening among each people with this fundamental spirit; the peoples of the East seek to secure peace as peoples of the East and respond to material civilization with spiritual culture. It is vital that we grasp this national policy and forge ahead. Deeply moved by the vastness of His Majesty's grace (聖恩), I hope that the people will firmly hold their resolve for the New Year and respond in service to His Majesty's grace.<27>

**Summary**

This New Year's address by Governor-General Minami Jirō outlines the progress in Korea under Japanese rule, emphasizing stability and industrial growth. The core message revolves around the policy of "Sŏn-Man Illyŏ" (Korea and Manchuria as One Body), detailing cooperative projects like border bridges, railways (Chiamussu-Najin), trade promotion, joint policing, potential Yalu River hydroelectric power, and migration agreements, all aimed at integrating Korea economically and politically with Japan-controlled Manchukuo. Minami calls for continued effort, national unity, and spiritual resolve from the Korean people to overcome difficulties and repay the Emperor's grace. For historians, the article is a clear articulation of Japanese colonial policy in the late 1930s, highlighting the strategic importance of Korea as a bridge to Manchuria, the mechanisms of economic exploitation and integration, the emphasis on assimilation ("Sŏn-Man Illyŏ"), and the rhetoric used to demand Korean loyalty and participation in the Japanese imperial project on the eve of wider war.
