Article Type: 시 (Poem)

Snowflakes descend
Tangling, untangling, trembling on a spiderweb
Let the piano cry, we are musicians (樂家)

Butterfly, butterfly snowflakes
Settle and hide on that young lady's (娘子) hair ribbon
Blackly, whitely, we are painters (畵家)

The flurry of snow pours down
Covering the universe (宇宙)—without a gap
Ring the bell (鍾), we are all together mourners (喪제) <322>

**Summary**

This poem by Yun Kŭk-yŏng uses the imagery of falling snowflakes to evoke different artistic roles. Initially delicate and observed like musical notes or brushstrokes ("we are musicians," "we are painters"), the snowflakes eventually become an overwhelming force, covering the entire universe. The poem culminates in a call to ring a bell, identifying "us" collectively as mourners (喪제). From a historical perspective, the poem's progression from artistic observation to a final image of universal coverage and collective mourning could potentially reflect the somber atmosphere or suppressed feelings of the colonial period, portraying a sense of being overwhelmed or a shared, perhaps unspoken, sorrow under the encompassing force depicted metaphorically by the snow.

눈송이
						尹克榮
눈송이 나려와
엉키며 풀니며 거미줄에 떤다
피아노 울어라 우리는 樂家

나비나비 눈송이
저 娘子 머리태에 안젓다 숨는다
검게 희게 우리는 畵家

눈빨이 쏘다저
宇宙를 덥헛다-빈틈업시
鍾을 울여라 우리는 다가치 喪제<322>
