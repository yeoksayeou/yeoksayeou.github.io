**Body Text Translation:**
Ode to the New Year
						Pak Seyŏng

The red sun breaks the east,
The dawn rooster has crowed, is it the New Year?
No, because the sun has made one revolution, is it the New Year?

Because they shout, "Buy lucky dippers!", is it the New Year?
Lavishly dressed children come and go paying New Year's respects,
The red ribbons of seesawing ladies flutter, is this too the New Year?

If it's the New Year, a new heart should take root.
Yet, saying that my heart is still old, rusted, and untrustworthy,
How can I shout that it is the New Year? <302>

Every year, calling it the New Year, I resolve my heart firmly,
But as the days go by, that resolve vanishes like smoke.
How can I welcome it as the New Year?

However, this year at least, I will sprout a new seedling in my heart,
Make flowers bloom on a warm spring day,
And passing through the green shade and fragrant grass of that summer, I will try to bear fruit.

Then, this year, this heart of mine that was slack,
I will temper it and temper it, and bow my head to that rising sun,
And I will definitely try to build a New Year of the heart.
(New Year's Day, Chŏngch'uk Year [1937]) <303>

**Summary**

This poem by Pak Seyŏng reflects on the true meaning of the New Year, contrasting external celebrations (sunrise, traditions like lucky dippers and New Year's greetings) with the internal state of the speaker's heart. The speaker feels their heart is still "old and rusted," making past resolutions fade like smoke. However, the poem concludes with a renewed determination for the current year (1937) to cultivate genuine inner change – a "New Year of the heart" – symbolized by nurturing a seedling into bloom and fruit. For historians, the poem offers a glimpse into personal introspection and the theme of self-renewal during the Japanese colonial period. It expresses a quiet, personal resolve and hope for betterment, potentially reflecting a subtle desire for change or perseverance in difficult times, focusing on inner strength when external circumstances were oppressive.

新年頌
						朴世永
붉은 해 동이 터오고
새벽 닭이 울었다 새해오리까
아니 한박휘 해가 도랐으니 새해오리까?

복조리 사라외치니 새해오리까
호사한 아기들 세배하러 오고 가며
널뛰는 색씨 붉은당기 날르니 이 또한 새해오리까?

새해어든 새맘이 깃드려야지
그마음 아즉도 묵고 녹스러 못믿을건 내맘이라면서도
내 어찌 새해라 외치오리. <302>

해마다 새해라 마음 단단히 먹어보것만
날이 갈수록 그 마음 연기같이 사러지나니
내 어찌 새해라 반기오리

허나 이해만은 내 또 마음의 새싹을 틔워
따스한 봄날에 꽃을 피우고
綠陰芳草 저 여름을 지나거든 열매를 매저보련다

그러면 이해엔 풀어젔든 이내맘을
달구고 달구어 떠오르는 저해에 머리르 숙이여
내 기어히 마음의 새해를 지어보련다
(丁丑元旦) <303>
