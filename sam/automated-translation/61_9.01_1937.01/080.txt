Mr. Yi Sangjae passed away on February 29, Shōwa 2 (1927), so this spring marks the full 10th anniversary. We publish here the memorial writings of several individuals who were personally acquainted with the late Mr. Yi during his lifetime. Furthermore, for the February issue coinciding with the anniversary date, we intend to publish new recollections from various figures in society in this magazine.

Alas, Has It Already Been Ten Years?

Yun Ch'iho
Has it already been a full 10 years since Wŏllam Sŏnsaeng (Mr. Yi Sangjae's pen name) departed? The scene of carrying the coffin from the Youth Hall seems like yesterday, yet alas, have 10 years already flowed by since then?
寂寞韓山月 (The lonely moon over the quiet Korean mountains)
先生去不歸 (The master left and does not return)
八十風浪息 (The storms of eighty years have ceased)
芳名與日輝 (His fragrant name shines with the sun)
Thus I wrote a mourning poem (輓詞) for him, and has it already been 10 years in the meantime? Now, facing the 10th anniversary of Wŏllam Sŏnsaeng's passing, I cannot suppress my sorrowful feelings.
I began associating with Mr. Yi in the Sinsa year (辛巳年 - 1881). At that time, Pak Chŏngyang (朴定陽) became the envoy when a diplomatic mission (修信使) was sent to the Japanese government, and Wŏllam Sŏnsaeng and I were his attendants. There, we met Hong Yŏngsik (洪英植), a key figure in the Kapsin Reform Movement (甲申改革運動). Afterward, when the Kapsin Reform failed and Hong Yŏngsik was killed by government troops, Wŏllam went to his hometown in Ch'ungnam (忠南) for a time. Then, in the Chŏnghae year (丁亥年 - 1887), he became the secretary to the Minister Plenipotentiary to the United States <63> and went to America. After several years there, he returned to Seoul, served as a scribe (文案) in the T'ongwiyŏng (統衛營 - Capital Garrison Command) and sometimes as a committee member of the Chŏnwŏn'guk (典園局 - Bureau of Palace Gardens). During the Kapo Reforms (甲午更張 - 1894), he was appointed Ubusŭngji (右副承旨 - Right Royal Secretary), and later served as the Director of the Bureau of Academic Affairs (學務局長) in the Ministry of Education (學部). Throughout these many years, we always spent time closely together. An unforgettable event is the winter of the Ŭlmi year (乙未年 - 1895). Sŏ Chaep'il (徐載弼), a progressive figure returned from America, organized the Hyŏpsŏnghoe (協成會). At that time, Wŏllam Sŏnsaeng was a scholar of Confucianism (孔孟의 儒學), while Mr. Sŏ was a Christian believer, yet their spirits aligned, eventually leading to the founding of the Independence Club (獨立協會). They gathered at the Mohwagwan (慕華舘) outside the West Gate (西大門) and began a new cultural movement with cooperation between the upper and lower classes. At that time, Wŏllam took the podium almost daily, delivering words to awaken the world (警世). Later, he received Christian baptism and subsequently served as the General Secretary of the Young Men's Christian Association (基督敎靑年會 總務), dedicating many years to the Christian movement on the Peninsula, as is widely known.

Thinking back, there is hardly any sphere of our society where the footprints of the master have not reached. In his later years, while attending to Christian affairs, he also served as President of the Chosŏn Education Association (朝鮮敎育協會長), President of the Boy Scouts Federation (少年斥候聯盟總裁), and President of the Chosŏn Ilbo (朝鮮日報社長). Is it without reason that the entire world expressed deep condolences upon his passing?
Now, as the times become ever more complex and difficult, the feeling of reverence for the master becomes keenly renewed.<64>

Anecdotes of Wŏllam Sŏnsaeng

Whenever he had free time at the Youth Hall, he often played Changgi (將棋 - Korean chess) with the young people. One day, the board situation was unfavorable; Mr. Yi was defending his palace (宮), and his opponent had a horse (馬) and pawn (卒) on the side. The one with the horse and pawn said to Mr. Yi,
"Sir, you've lost now." <62>
However, Mr. Yi still disagreed, saying,
"Where have I lost? Let's keep playing."
After making a few more moves, the pawn finally entered the palace and called check (呼將). Only then did Mr. Yi put down the pieces and say,
"Now I've lost. Where was the loss before you called check?"
Even in such games, Mr. Yi always imparted unspoken lessons to the youth.

Then Should I Wear It Over the Hat?

Mr. Yi, who never fussed over his appearance (邊幅) throughout his life, became even more unconcerned in his old age. During the severe cold of winter, he often wore a traditional p'ungdŏngi (풍동이 - a type of winter hat) topped with a Chungshan hat (中山帽 - Nakayama-style hat). One day at the Youth Hall, a young man who saw this was greatly surprised and exclaimed,
"Sir, are you wearing a p'ungdŏngi over a Chungshan hat?"
Mr. Yi, with a faint smile, responded with a counter-question,
"Well then, should I wear the p'ungdŏngi *over* the Chungshan hat?" <63>
This caused everyone present to burst into laughter. Mr. Yi's witty retorts (圓滑應酬) were generally like this.

My Body is Unwell, and I Don't Beg

When Mr. Yi was imprisoned (在監時), the judge asked him,
"Do you want to get out?"
"If you tell me to leave, I'll leave; if you tell me to stay, I'll stay."
"Then we'll grant bail. Can you provide 300 won?"
"I am a poor man. I don't have a single penny (分錢)."
"You are close to Yun Ch'iho (尹致昊); ask him for the bail money (保證金)."
"Asking someone else for money just for my own comfort is unreasonable, so I absolutely cannot do it."
Later, the court contacted Mr. Yun and arranged for his release (放釋). <64>

Borrowed Life

In the winter of Ŭlch'uk (乙丑冬 - 1925), a certain Mr. Kim met Mr. Yi early one morning on the road. Learning that Mr. Yi was going to preach (講道次) at a church outside the city, Mr. Kim expressed sympathy for his labors in old age. Mr. Yi smiled gently (莞爾히) and said,
"Life reaching seventy is rare since ancient times (人生七十古來稀). Isn't life beyond 70 borrowed (가外)? Since I am living this borrowed life now, there's nothing to regret losing."
Thus, Mr. Yi did not even consider his life his private possession.

Requesting Payment for Selling Offices

When Mr. Yi was serving as Ch'amch'an (*贊 - Vice Minister/Councillor) [illegible text]*, the Ch'amjŏngdaesin (參政大臣 - State Councillor) <65> Pak Chesun (朴齊純) once approached Mr. Yi and said,
"I must inevitably appoint several dozen committee members, so please be aware. And you, Your Excellency (令監), should also appoint a few."
After agreeing readily, Mr. Yi added,
"I have no need for committee members, so please give me the equivalent in money (代錢)."
Pak, taken aback (唐慌), replied,
"Where would I get the money to pay you instead?"
Mr. Yi, still calm and composed (自若), said,
"Your Excellency (大監) is always selling positions, so you must know the market (販路) well. Since I don't know the market, what use are they to me?"
Hearing this, Pak was speechless (默然無語).

Posthumous Manuscript: A Letter to the Youth

Yi Sangjae
I have already briefly discussed the significance of a youth's personal status, methods of guidance, and the resulting effects and efficacy, offering encouragement to you, the youth. I have heard it said (曾聞) that if a house is built on mud and sand (泥沙), when floods come and winds strike (潦至風撞), it will surely collapse (傾覆), but if built on bedrock (磐石), even if floods come and winds strike, it will never be destroyed (永不壞損). Though the houses are the same, why does one collapse while the other doesn't? It is because their foundations (基礎), being either rock or sand (或石沙), differ in firmness (固與不固). Not only does the tangible structure of a house relate to this, but the prosperity, misfortune, and fortune (盛衰禍福) of a family (一家) and the security, peril, rise, and fall (安危興亡) of a nation (一國) also depend on an unseen, hidden (無形冥冥之中) foundation. Let's first consider the family. Suppose magnificent halls and great beams (華堂巨棟) stand arrayed left and right (左列右翼), fertile fields (良田沃土) spread near and far (近舖遠列), precious treasures (珍寶) are piled high in chests (箱簏), and servants bustle (奔走?) about the corridors (廊廡). One enters such a house and sees the master (主人翁) with frost-like hair (霜雪이 滿顚) laboring hard (勞苦勤動), running east and west. However, if his young sons and brothers (子弟之靑年者) are perhaps corrupt in nature (性이 不正), solely engaging in extravagance and violence (專事奢暴), or ignorant in knowledge (智識이 愚昧), unable to distinguish beans from wheat (不辨菽麥), or unhealthy in body (身體가 不康), chronically ill and bedridden (疾病長臥), even though today it is said, "Youth do not [illegible - manage?] family affairs (不*家務)," someday they will become the heads of the household (家主人). Thus, the future consequences (然後事) can be foreseen. Either they will dissipate everything themselves in one morning (自手로 一朝蕩盡), or others will covet and seize it (他人이 窺視占有), turning fields and houses into ruins (田宅이 浩劫) and gold into dung (黃金이 糞土). They merely lament (徒歎) that fortune has turned against them (運之否塞) and still do not regret their past mistakes (尙不知悔悟前非). How foolish (一何愚哉)! Even if some repent, mending the fold after the sheep is lost (失羊補牢) comes too late (時己晩矣). What can be done (奈何)? Oh, if only the youth would set their course early (早定方針), nurture their virtue to rectify their mind and nature (養其德以正心性), cultivate their learning to enlighten their knowledge (修其學以開智識), and protect their lives to strengthen their bodies (衛其生以健身體)! If they pass this down to their sons and grandsons (子之子孫之孫), how glorious will their fortune (榮福) be (顧何如哉)? Therefore, isn't it true that youth are the foundation of a family (一家基礎者)? Now let's consider the nation. <65> Strong city walls and moats (城池堅固) are not what a nation relies on; elite troops and sharp weapons (甲兵精銳) are not the nation's blessing; reclaiming land and filling storehouses (闢土地實倉廩) are not the nation's urgent tasks; good laws, beautiful regulations (良法美規), benevolent governance, and admirable plans (善政嘉謨) are merely tools (機具) for the nation. If the right people are lacking (苟無其人), then even good, beautiful, benevolent, and admirable governance, plans, regulations, and laws will transform into means for greedy exploitation and tyranny (食利暴虐), and storehouses, lands, city walls, moats, troops, and weapons will also become aids in sickening the nation and impoverishing the people (病國殃民). Internal strife (內訌?) will arise, foreign invasion (外侵) will intensify daily, and the nation's destruction will be self-invited and self-inflicted (自招自取). An ancient sage taught (古聖이 有訓): "If the right person exists, their governance will flourish (其人이 存則其政이 擧)." The essence of a nation being a nation truly lies in its people (亶在乎人). But can one be called human (人爲人) merely because their eyes can see and ears can hear (豈徒目之能視와 耳之能聽)? Can one be called human because their hands can grasp, feet can move, tongue can speak, and mouth can eat (手之能攝足之能動과 舌之能言口之能食)? Flying birds, running beasts (飛禽走獸), insects, and hidden fish (昆虫潛魚) all possess these abilities. What distinguishes humans (人之異乎是者) are moral nature (德性), knowledge (智識), and physical health (肉體之衛生). If one wishes to cultivate these three, when should it be done (將於何時可乎)? If one does not cultivate their future path early in youth (苟不於靑年에 早修前程) and diligently nurture it (動勉栽培), what will become of them in adulthood and old age (壯而老而에 其將何爲)? <66> The youth of today are the accomplished adults (老成) of tomorrow. Those who implement policies and orders in the halls of government (廟堂之上에 施措政令者) are these people; those who reform customs for the better in the alleys and lanes (閭巷之間에 移易善俗者) are also these people. Those who diligently guide the succeeding youth (勤勉後來之靑年), passing this down through generations (以是而傳之世世), eternally without replacement (永永不替者), are also these people. The boundless treasure (寶錄) of a nation, growing from poverty to wealth (由貧而富), from weakness to strength (由弱而强), from smallness to greatness (由小而大), from darkness to enlightenment (由暗而明), becoming ever more consolidated (愈久而愈進鞏固者) as time passes, is none other than these people. Therefore, does the foundation of a nation (一國之基礎) not lie in its youth (顧不在於靑年乎)? I dare to offer a few words (敢將數句話) to earnestly advise (勤告) the parents and elders (父兄) of the youth of this age and the officials in power (當路諸公): Do not say our nation is peaceful today (莫謂吾國이 今日泰平), and do not say our family is comfortable today (莫謂吾家가 今日安樂). Peace and comfort (泰平安樂) are inherently inconstant (元來靡常); blessings follow good deeds, and calamities follow evil deeds (福善禍淫), stemming from one's own actions (由人自作). Where do good and evil come from (善惡은 由何오)? They cannot be attained without education (非敎不得). When is the time for education (敎在何時오)? The time is youth (時哉靑年)! What people desire is treasure (寶); do not hide treasures in wooden chests or mouse-infested granaries (忽藏寶於木箱鼠倉). Youth are that treasure! What people seek is fortune (福); do not seek fortune in Buddhist temples or spirit shrines (忽求福於佛宇神祠). Youth bestow that fortune! What people love is glory (榮); do not seek glory from powerful land and sea gates (勿求榮於陸海權門). Youth are that glory! Glory is the brightness of reputation (名譽之光); fortune is endless peace and comfort (安樂之無窮); treasure is the root of wealth and strength (富强之根本). Just look (第看) at the Youth Hall in the capital city (京城內靑年會舘). Fortune, treasure, and glory all come from within it (俱從此中來). Please do not build your house on sand (請勿建屋於沙上); make the youth the foundation of your family and nation (以靑年으로 爲家國之基礎하소서). <67>

**Summary**

This article commemorates the 10th anniversary of the death of Yi Sangjae (Wŏllam), a prominent Korean independence activist, educator, and journalist. It features a reminiscence by Yun Ch'iho, recalling their long association from early diplomatic missions, through the Independence Club era, to Yi's later work with the YMCA, educational associations, and the Chosŏn Ilbo. Several anecdotes illustrate Yi's character: his wit, humility, integrity (refusing bail through others), and dedication even in old age. The article concludes with posthumously published poems and an essay by Yi Sangjae himself, emphasizing the crucial role of youth – their moral, intellectual, and physical development – as the true foundation for the future prosperity and strength of both family and nation. From a historical perspective, the article offers insights into the networks and activities of Korean intellectuals and reformers spanning from the late Joseon Dynasty through the Japanese colonial period. Yun Ch'iho's reflections highlight key moments like the Kapsin Reform, the Independence Club, and the introduction of Western ideas and Christianity. Yi Sangjae's essay, written during the colonial era, subtly underscores the importance of nurturing the younger generation as the basis for national survival and future self-strengthening, a common theme among Korean nationalists under Japanese rule. Historians might find the interplay between traditional Confucian values and modern (including Christian) influences in figures like Yi and Yun, the specific anecdotes illustrating Yi's character and interactions (like the one with Pak Chesun), and the underlying nationalist sentiment in Yi's call to build the nation's foundation on its youth particularly interesting.

李商在 先生 十年祭
李商在 先生이 昭和 2年 2月 29日에 別世하섯스니 今春으로 滿10年祭를 마지하게 된다. 이에 生前 先生으로 더부러 親交게시든 數氏의 追悼文을 실거니와 더욱 來2月號의 祭日에는 社會人士諸氏의 새로운 문물의 追憶을 本誌에 실고저 함니다.

어허, 벌서 十年인가

尹致昊
月南先生이 가신지 어허 벌서 만10년인가, 그때 청년회관에서 運柩하든 광경이 어제갔것만 어허, 벌서 그사이 10년이 흘넛든가.
寂寞韓山月
先生去不歸
八十風浪息
芳名與日輝
라고 나는 輓詞를 써드렷더니, 그 동안이 벌서 10년 채든가, 이제 月南先生의 10年祭를 當함애 추然한 心懷를 금할 길이 없다.
내가 先生으로 더부러 사괴기 시작하기는 辛巳年이라. 그 때 日本정부에 修信使를 보내게 되이 朴定陽씨가 使節이 되고, 月南先生과 나는 그 隨員이 되었다. 거기에서 우리는 甲申改革運動의 主要人材이든 洪英植씨를 맛낫든 것이다. 그 뒤 月南은 甲申改革이 실패되고 또한, 洪英植씨 마저 관군에게 죽으매 一時 忠南故里에 가 게시다가, 丁亥年에 다시 駐米全權의 서기관이 <63> 되어 米國에 가 있었고 그러기를 몇 해 하다가, 다시 서울에 도라와 統衛營의 文案 노릇도 하고 혹 典園局委員으로도 있다가 甲午更張때에 右副承旨로 임명되었고 그 뒤 學部의 學務局長으로 게섰는데, 이 여러해 동안을 늘 갔가히 대하며 지내왔섰다. 더구나 이처지지 안은 일은 乙未年 겨을일이다. 米國에서 도라온 新進 徐載弼씨가 協成會를 모으니, 그 때 月南先生은 孔孟의 儒學의 士요, 徐씨는 기독교 신자엇스나, 서로 의기상합하야 필경 獨立協會를 창설하고, 西大門밧 慕華舘에 모히여 上下協力, 新文化運動을 이르키기 시작한 것이니, 그 때 月南은 거지반 每日이다십히 演壇에 올나 警世의 소리를 전하였다. 그 뒤 기독교 세례을 受하고, 이어 基督敎靑年會 總務로, 半島基督敎運動에 다년 헌신하였음은 世人이 다 아는 바와 如하다.

생각건대 우리 사회의 모든 방면에 선생의 발차최 아니 간데 벌로 없섯으니 만년에는 기독교 일을 보시는 한편 朝鮮敎育協會長, 少年斥候聯盟總裁, 朝鮮日報社長으로 게섰다. 선생이 별세함애 一世―깁흔 哀悼의 뜻을 표했음이 엇지 뜻없다 하리요.
이제 시세는 더욱 復雜多端하매 선생을 追慕하는 감회, 새삼스러히 절실함을 늣기노라.<64>

月南先生 逸話

청년회관에서 間隙있을 때면 흔이 청년들로더부터 將棋를 戱弄하더니 1일은 국세가 불리하야 先生은 宮을 직히고 대수편에 馬卒이 있는지라 馬卒을 가진 자―先生을 향하야
「先生님 인제는 지섯음니다.」 <62>
그러나 先生은 여전히 不肯하며
「어듸 익있나 더 두게.」
하야 몃 번을 行馬한 후 드듸여 卒이 宮中에 들어와 呼將을 하게 되매 先生은 비로소 將棋를 노으며
「인제는 젓네. 앗가 將 불으기 전에 어듸 젓는가.」
先生은 이러한 유희중에도 청년에게 항상 무언의 교훈을 베풀고 있는 것이다.

그럼 帽子 우에다 쓸나

평생 邊幅을 꿈이지 아니 하는 先生은 老來애 더욱 不關하게 되야 매양 冬節酷寒의 際에는 在來의 풍동이 위에다 中山帽를 쓰는 일이 많었다. 一日은 靑年會舘에서 이를 본 청년이 大驚小怪하여 曰
「先生님 中山帽일에다 풍동이를 쓰심닛가.」
先生은 미소를 帶하고 應口反問하여 曰
「그러면 中山帽위다가 풍동이를 쓰랴.」
하야 滿座를 失笑케 하니 先生의 圓滑應酬가<63> 대개 이러하더라.

내 몸 便차고 求乞은 안는다

先生이 在監時에 재판장이 先生을 보고
「나가고 십흔가?」
「나가라면 나가고 있스라면 있슬 뿐이로라.」
「그러면 保釋을 할 터이니 돈 300원을 낼 수 있는가.」
「나는 艱難한 사람이라. 分錢도 업노라.」
「그대가 尹致昊와 친하니 그에게 保證金을 구하여 보라.」
「내 몸 편하자고 남에게 돈을 請求함은 無理한 일인즉 절대로 못 하겠노라.」
其後 재판소에서 尹씨에게 교섭하야 放釋하었다. <64>

가外의 生命

乙丑冬에 某씨가 早朝路上에서 先生을 맛나 先生이 시외 某교회에 講道次로 가심을 알고 老來의 勤勞를 慰勞하니 先生은 莞爾히 우서 曰
「人生七十古來稻인데 70이상의 생명은 가外의 것이 아닌가. 지금 나는 이 가外의 생명을 가지고 있으니까 앗가울 것은 업네.」
先生은 그 생명까지도 私有치 아니함이 이리하었다.

賣官의 代錢請求

先生이 *贊으로 在** 時때 參政大臣<65>朴齊純씨가 一日은 先生을 대하야
「내가 불가불 委員 幾10名을 쓸 터이니 알어주오. 그리고 令監도 幾名間 쓰시요.」
이와가치 상의하니 先生은 1차 快諾하고 다시 말을 이어
「내게는 委員이 소용없으니 代錢으로 주시요.」
이와 가치 請求하는지라 朴씨가 唐慌하야
「내가 무슨 돈이 있어 代錢을 들이겠소.」
先生은 여전히 自若한 태도로
「大監께서는 늘 팔어 자시닛가 販路를 잘 아시려니와 내야 販路를 몰으니 소용이 있소.」
朴씨가 말을 듯고 무然無語하였다.

遺稿 靑年에 告하는 書

李商在
청년이 개인 신분상의 관계가 如何함과 敎導방법이 如何함과 결과 效力의 如何함을 前己 略述하야 청년되는 諸君에게 권고하였거니와 曾聞하니 建屋於泥沙하면 潦至風撞에 必致傾覆하고 建屋於磐石하면 潦至風撞에 永不壞損이라 하니 同一廻屋이로대 或 傾覆不壞者는 何也오.  以其基礎之或石沙하야 固與不固가 不同故也라. 一屋子의 有形한 關係가 如是할 뿐 아니라 一家의 盛裏禍福과 一國의 安危興亡이 無形冥冥之中에 亦有所由然之基礎하나니 第以一家論之하건대 華堂巨棟이 左列右翼하고 良由之土가 近舖遠列하며 珍寶는 堆積於箱底하고 使令이 동足於廊舍언*는 入其家見之하니 主 人翁은 霜雪이 滿顚하야 東西奔走에 勞苦勤骨하되 其子弟之靑年者난 或 其性이 不正하야 專事貧暴하거나 或 智識이 愚昧하야 不辨叔麥하거나 或 身體가 不康하야 疾病長臥한즉 今日에 雖曰 靑年은 不*家務라 하니 他日에 家主人을 作하리니 然則然後事를 可知할지로다. 自手로 一朝蕩盡하거나 他人이 窺視 占有하야 田宅이 浩劫이오. 黃金이 糞土라. 徒歎 運之否塞하고 尙不知悔悟前非하나니 一何愚哉오. 設有悔之者라도 失羊補牢가 時己晩矣니 奈何, 오 苟使靑年으로 早定方針하야 養其德以正心性하고 修其學以開智識하며 衛其生以健身體하야 以是而子之子孫之孫하면 其榮福이 顧何如哉아 然則靑年之爲一家基礎者不其然乎아. 第就一國論之하건대 <65> 城池堅固가 非家之恃오 甲兵精銳가 非國之福이오 闢土地實倉底이 非國之急務오 良法美規와 善政嘉謨가 不過是爲國之機具니 苟無其人이면 政謨規法之良美善嘉者가 變而爲食慾暴虐하고 倉底土地와 城池甲兵이 亦足爲病國宮民之一助하리니 內底이 群起하고 外侵이 日甚하야 國之滅亡을 自招自取할지라. 古聖이 有訓하대 其人이 存則其政이 擧라 하니 國之爲國이 亶在乎人而人爲人이 豈徒目之能視와 耳之能德으로 謂之人乎아 手之挽足之動과 舌之悼口之喫으로 謂之人乎아. 飛禽走獸와 대 虫潛魚도 皆有是能하나니 人之異乎是者는 德性也와 智識也와 肉體之衛生也니 欲養此三者컨대 將於何時可乎아 苟不於靑年에 早修前程하야 動勉栽培하면 壯而老而에 其將何爲오. <66> 今日之靑年은 他日之老成이라. 廟堂之上에 施措政令 者此人也오 閭巷之間에 移易善俗者도 此人也오.  勤勉後來之靑年하야 以是而傳之世世에 永永不替者도 亦此人也니 一家之寶錄이 無彊하야 由貧而富하고 甲弱而强하고 由小而大하고 由暗而明하야 愈久而愈進鞏固者가 莫非此人이라. 然則一國之基礎가 顧不在於靑年乎아. 敢將數句話하야 當世靑年의 父兄과 當路諸公에게 勤告하노니 莫謂吾國이 今日泰平하고 莫謂吾家가 今日安樂하소서. 泰平安樂이 元來靡常하야 福善禍惡이 由人自作이니 善惡은 由何오. 非敎不得이며 敎在何時오. 時哉靑年이로다. 人之所欲者는 寶也니 忽藏寶於木箱鼠倉이다. 靑年이 是寶며 人之所求者는 福也니 忽求福於怫宇神祠어다. 靑年이 施福이며 人之所好者는 榮也니 勿求榮於陸海權門이어다. 靑年이 是榮이라 榮者는 名譽之文明이오. 福者는 安樂之無窮이요 寶者는 富强之根本이니 第看京城內靑年會堂이어다. 福也寶也榮也가 俱從此中來하나니 請勿建屋於沙上하고 以靑年으로 爲家之基礎하소서. <67>
