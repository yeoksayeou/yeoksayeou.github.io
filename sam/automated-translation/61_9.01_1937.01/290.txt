Author Introduction

This gentleman was born in Kyŏngsŏng and is 37 years old this year. He early graduated from Paejae High School and Common School (培材高普), then went across to Tokyo where he devoted himself solely to the study of literary arts.
From the time of the "Paekcho" (白潮) literary group, he has dedicated himself to the Chosŏn art movement up to the present day. His real name is "Pak Chonghwa" (朴鍾和). He once startled our literary world by publishing the work "Hŭkpang Pigok" (黑房祕曲). Up to the present day, he has published numerous poetic works.

(Pipa Xing - 琵琶行)

Thick and fast, fast and thick, strummed in confusion, <244>
Like large pearls and small pearls falling on a jade plate.
Like orioles' lovely warbling, slipping beneath the flowers,
Like a sobbing spring flowing down a rapid stream.
As if the spring water, cold and sluggish, the strings seemed to break,
Seemed to break, communication ceased, the sound briefly halted.
A separate, hidden feeling, a secret resentment arose,
At this time, silence was better than sound.

Like a silver vase suddenly shattering, water and pulp splashing out,
Like armored cavalry suddenly charging, swords and spears clashing.
At the end of the song, she drew the plectrum across the center,
The four strings together sounded like tearing silk.
Boats east and west fell utterly silent,
Only the autumn moon, white upon the river's heart, was seen. <245>

How many times did I laugh and sing?

My Dian Tou cloud hairpin (鈿頭雲*) beat the rhythm and broke,
My blood-red silk skirt was overturned, spilled wine staining it.
This year's joy was followed by the next year's,
Autumn moons and spring breezes were passed by idly.
My younger brother went off to join the army, my dear aunt died,
Mornings departed, evenings came, my face grew old. <248>
My gate became deserted, horses and saddles scarce,
Grown old, I married and became a merchant's wife.

Merchants value profit and think lightly of separations,
Last year he went to Fuliang (浮梁) to buy tea.
Coming and going, I guard the empty boat at the river mouth,
Around the boat, the moon is bright, the river water cold.
Deep in the night, I suddenly dreamed of my youth,
Weeping in my dream, tears fell from my made-up face,
Wetting the red railings. <249>

**Summary**

This article introduces the author, Wŏlt'an (Pak Chonghwa), a prominent literary figure active since the "Paekcho" movement. The main content is the third part of a series on the Chinese poet Bai Juyi (Bai Letian), featuring a Korean translation of excerpts from his famous poem "Pipa Xing". The translation attempts to capture the musicality and pathos of the original, recounting the story of a former courtesan, now a merchant's wife, lamenting her past glories and current loneliness. From a historical perspective, the article highlights the continued interest in classical Chinese literature among Korean intellectuals during the colonial period, and the effort to render these classics into vernacular Korean, reflecting contemporary literary trends and nationalist undertones in preserving and developing the Korean language even when discussing foreign literature. The choice of "Pipa Xing," with its themes of faded glory and present sorrow, might also resonate subtly with the colonial situation.

詩聖白樂天-그의 生涯와 藝術-(3)

(琵琶行)
嘈嘈切切錯雜彈
大珠小珠落玉盤.
間關驚語花底滑
幽咽泉流水下灘
水泉冷澁絃疑絶
疑絶不通聲暫歇
別有幽情暗恨生
此時無聲勝有聲

우둥우둥 댕기댕기
엇석겨 타니<244>
크고적은 구실알
옥반에 구는 듯.
어엽부다 꾀꼴이 노래
꼿 밑으로 밋그러지고
목밀 듯 흐르는 샘물
여울에 우는듯하이.
물소리 차온듯 막히니
비파줄 끊어 젓든가
줄소리 귾저젓나? 통치않으니
고흔 그소리 잠간 넘첫네.
이러할 때 그윽한 고요한 정은
가만한 한과 같이 설이워젓다.
소리없는 그 정경이야
소리 있을 그때보다 더 좋으쿠나

銀甁乍破水漿選
鐵騎突出刀鎗鳴.
曲終收撥當心畵
四絃一聲如裂帛.
東船西舫悄無言
唯見江心秋月白<245>

몇번이나 笑노래했든고

鈿頭雲*擊節碎
血色羅裙飜洒汚
今年歡迸復明年
秋月春風等閑度.
弟走從軍阿姨死
暮去朝來顔色故.
門前冷落鞍馬稀
老大嫁作商人婦.

비녀머리 구름비치갠
장단을 처서 부시였구려
방으스름한 피빛이 많은
술을 업질러 더레웠구려.
금년도 질거워라
그 이듬해 또 그러하이
가을달 봄 바람을
등한히 보냈구료.
동생은 전쟁에 군사가 되고
은헤깊은 이모는 돌아가섰네.
세월은 흘러 흘러<248>
얼골 늙었오
문앞은 쓸쓸하야
날 찾는이 드물구려.
늙어서 시집가니
장사하는 이 게집이 됐네.
商人重利輕別離
前年浮梁買茶去
去來江口守空船
遶船月明江水寒.
夜深忽夢少年事
夢啼粧淚紅欄干.

장사는 리만중한양
리별은 가볍게 아는구료.
지난해 떼를 타고
차 사러 갔네.
오락가락 강상에 빈배 직히니
돌닌 배엔 달밝어
강문 차구료
밤 깊어 젊은때 일
꿈꾸어 보니
꿈에 울은 눈물이 흘러 떠러저
붉은 난간을 적시워 놓앗네.<249>
<244-249>
