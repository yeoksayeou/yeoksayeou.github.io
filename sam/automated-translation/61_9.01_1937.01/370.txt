Song of the White Clothes
						Ham Hyŏngsu

All kinds of light, all kinds of sorrow, all kinds of joy
Are cast upon you, the pure white,
Yet you, within a quiet conception,
Merely engage in calm contemplation.

Torn in the spring water, placed upon the fulling block,
When washing away your old stains;
Through this, you are again white, though once soiled (旣垢).
You tremble in your clean reflection.

Oh, in the midst of terrifying confusion and darkness,
O noble spirit (情神) shining alone!
Within it lies hidden solemn etiquette (禮節),
And cold contemplation lies submerged within.
-(For Dance) <290>

**Summary**

This poem, "Song of the White Clothes," personifies the traditional white clothing of Koreans, portraying it as a symbol of resilience and inner purity. It describes the clothes enduring various experiences ("light," "sorrow," "joy"), being soiled and then cleansed, ultimately maintaining a noble spirit characterized by calm thought, reflection, solemnity, and contemplation, even amidst "confusion and darkness." From a historical perspective, the poem is significant as it uses the potent symbol of 'white clothes' (白衣), strongly associated with Korean identity, during the Japanese colonial period. It subtly evokes themes of national endurance, spiritual purity, and quiet resistance against the oppressive environment ("confusion and darkness"), making it a potentially poignant expression of Korean cultural identity and spirit for historians studying the era. The note "For Dance" also suggests its use in performance arts, another avenue for cultural expression.

白衣詞
						咸亨洙
온갖 빛 온갖 서름 온갖 기뿜이
純白한 네우에 어리우나
오직 너는 고요한 觀念속에서
沈着한 思慮를 도리킬 뿐.

샘물에 찟기우고 다듬이에 오르고
네 묵은 때를 씨처버릴제
일로 너는 다시 旣垢한 白色.
네 깨끝한 反省에 떤다.

오 무서운 混亂과 어둠 속에서
호올로 빛나는 高貴한 情神이여.
거기에는 靜肅한 禮節이 숨어있고
차디찬 觀照가 잠겨있다.
