Urgent Notice

In the upcoming February issue, Mr. Wŏlnam's 'Record of Visits to Nobles' will be published,<64>
Also, the Teacher's [Mr. Wŏlnam's] collection of letters will be compiled and published.
Respectfully from the Editorial Department<65>
<64-65>

**Summary**

This brief notice announces two features planned for the February 1937 issue of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine: an article by "Mr. Wŏlnam" (Wŏlnam Sŏnsaeng) titled 'Record of Visits to Nobles' and a collection of his letters. Historically, this notice is interesting as it highlights the planned content featuring Wŏlnam (Yi Sangjae, a prominent independence activist and politician who died in 1927, though the reference might be posthumous or to someone else using the name), indicating his continued relevance or the magazine's interest in such figures. The focus on "nobles" (貴族, kwijok) could reflect ongoing societal interest in the former aristocracy or perhaps the newly established Korean peerage under Japanese rule, providing a glimpse into social topics deemed newsworthy during the colonial period.
