**Jokes**

**Good with Words**

Ch'unsik: "Ah, if only I could somehow win your love, I would gladly die. Please, will you permit it?"
Ok'hŭi: "Well then, try dying."

**Because of Men**

A: "Why do you think Adam was born first?"
B: "Well, if the man isn't born first, what fun would there be for the woman to be born?" <23>

**Summary**

This short article presents two simple jokes. The first is a dark humor exchange about a man's dramatic declaration of love and the woman's cynical reply. The second joke offers a slightly risqué, male-centric explanation for why Adam was created before Eve in the biblical story. From a historical perspective, these jokes show the continuation of everyday humor and cultural expression in Korean under colonial rule, using the Korean language (albeit with older orthography). The second joke, while brief, touches upon gender dynamics and perspectives prevalent at the time, potentially reflecting common societal views or simply standard joke structures. The specific language and spelling used are also of linguistic interest.
