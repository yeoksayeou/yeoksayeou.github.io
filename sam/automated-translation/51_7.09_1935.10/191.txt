**Summary**

This is an announcement from the Samch'ŏlli magazine company in Keijō (Seoul) declaring the establishment of its Kyŏngsangnamdo (South Kyŏngsang Province) Head Branch Office in Pusan, coinciding with the magazine's seventh anniversary. The notice outlines the branch's functions (handling articles, sales, advertising) and lists the key personnel, including the branch manager, advisors (a doctor and a hospital director), sales manager/reporter, and bill collector, along with the branch's address and contact information.

For historians, this notice provides concrete details about the business expansion and regional network of a major Korean cultural publication during the colonial period. The listing of specific personnel, including prominent local figures like doctors as advisors, and the clear delegation of functions (sales, editorial, advertising) illustrate the organizational structure and business practices of the time. The location in Pusan highlights the port city's importance as a regional hub.
