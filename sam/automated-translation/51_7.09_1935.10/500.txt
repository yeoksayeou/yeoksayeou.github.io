Poet
						Kim An-sŏ

When snow falls,
Saying flower blossoms flutter down heavily,<241>
If one sings, they are called a Poet.

When flowers fall,
Saying snowflakes flutter down heavily,
If one recites, they are called a Poet.<242>

**Summary**

This short poem by Kim An-sŏ defines a poet as someone who perceives and describes the world through inversions and metaphors, seeing falling snow as flower blossoms and falling blossoms as snowflakes. The act of singing or reciting these perceptions marks one as a poet. From a historical perspective, the poem's focus on nature imagery and subjective perception, rather than social or political themes, might reflect the artistic tendencies or constraints of the colonial period, where such lyrical expression could exist somewhat apart from overt political discourse. It highlights an appreciation for aesthetic sensibility.
