『Napoleon』 and Chosŏn
						Kim Tong-sŏng (金東成)

In the early 19th century, specifically 1816 (the 16th year of King Sunjo), the British warships HMS Lyra and HMS Alceste visited Chosŏn via China. On September 1st, they anchored at a point off the coast of Hwanghae Province (黃海道), Chosŏn, at latitude 37° 45' North and longitude 124° 40' East. As the sailors attempted to land, the islanders, unable to communicate verbally, gestured by drawing their hands across their own necks, signifying beheading, vehemently refusing the landing. The British sailors, unable to use force, inevitably weighed anchor from that spot. On the 4th, they arrived at a bay near Anando (安眼島) in Ch'ungch'ŏng Province (忠淸道), where the water depth was 6 fathoms, and discovered a large village ahead. In the evening, an official accompanied by numerous attendants in 6 or 7 small boats boarded the Lyra and met with the Commodore on the deck, subsequently visiting the Alceste as well. However, when disembarking from the Alceste, one attendant, cited for a minor mistake, was immediately subjected to punishment in the small boat, receiving over 10 lashes with a rod (笞) while everyone watched. The elderly official possessed an imposing dignity comparable to that of a king. Several small boats stayed anchored around the Lyra overnight for the purpose of monitoring the foreign vessel. The next morning, the old man, accompanied by even more attendants than the previous day, boarded a boat from the village on the opposite shore, visited the Lyra again, finished breakfast on deck, and had one of his attendants, a secretary, record the total number of crew members, the number of cannons and rifles, their lengths, and other details. At the official's request, the captain fired a cannon shot. Naturally, everyone was astonished by this.

After breakfast, the captain, accompanied by his officers, boarded a launch intending to go ashore. The old man, mistakenly thinking they were heading to the other ship, boarded with them. As they gradually approached the shore and prepared to land, the old man shook his head in opposition. Despite this, when the sailors landed, the old official hung his head dejectedly, appearing unable to bear his grief. His attitude suggested he believed a great disaster would befall his country due to the foreigners landing. Soldiers shouted back the gathering crowds.

Despite the sailors' display of having no ill intentions, the old official would not permit them to proceed further for long, stating that in four days, by order from the capital, he himself would be beheaded. Thus, the party returned to their ship.

The old official, who had come as far as the Alceste, received a copy of the Christian Bible (耶穌敎 聖經).<156>

On the afternoon of the 5th, they weighed anchor and proceeded south through an archipelago. The islands stood precipitously in the sea, and barely any reached more than 3 or 4 miles in length. The islands were somewhat cultivated, and residents gathered at the summit of each island, watching the fleet pass from afar.

On the 8th, they anchored at a location near latitude 34° North. The nearby islands numbered about 20. Here, they conducted various observations and surveys, verified the islands' positions and the state of the anchorage, and, for the future, even assigned English names to distinctive locations.

Whenever they attempted to land on any island, the islanders would refuse, gesturing as if cutting their throats, yet sometimes they would bring drinking water or coarse food. Through such contact with these islanders, it was utterly impossible to have accurate conversations about their politics, customs, or habits.

As landing in Chosŏn, nicknamed the Hermit Kingdom (隱士國), was impossible, the fleet's objective for the Chosŏn visit concluded with coastal surveying. On the 10th, they departed the Chosŏn Sea, returning to Britain via Ryukyu, Canton (廣東), Manila (마닐라), and the Cape of Good Hope (希望峯). En route, on August 11th of the following year, 1817, the Lyra called at St. Helena (聖헬레나), a solitary island in the Atlantic Ocean. At that time, Emperor Napoleon (奈巴崙大帝) happened to be exiled on this island. The Lyra's captain, Mr. Basil Hall (베실·홀氏), obtained an audience with the deposed emperor and reported on the circumstances of Chosŏn and Ryukyu, which he had visited during the voyage, presenting sketches of Chosŏn scenery and customs. Among them, a painting depicting a Chosŏn person particularly seemed to pique the deposed emperor's interest. Taking it in his hand, he remarked, "A white-haired old man wearing a large hat = holding a long pipe, with Chinese-style seating and clothing = an attendant is writing something = clearly depicted, truly a masterpiece." This was likely the first time Napoleon uttered words concerning Chosŏn. (From the voyage account of Mr. MacLeod (막클레오드氏), surgeon aboard the Alceste).<157>

**Summary**

This 1935 article recounts the 1816 visit of British warships HMS Lyra and Alceste to the coast of Chosŏn Korea. It details the cautious and resistant reception by local officials and islanders, marked by communication barriers and fear of repercussions for allowing foreigners ashore, reflecting Chosŏn's isolationist policy. The article highlights cultural observations, such as the strict hierarchy demonstrated by the public punishment of an attendant, and notes the British mapping of the coastline. An interesting postscript describes the Lyra's captain, Basil Hall, later meeting the exiled Napoleon on St. Helena and showing him sketches of Chosŏn, with Napoleon commenting favorably on a drawing of an elderly Korean official. For historians, the article is interesting as it reflects a Korean perspective from the colonial era looking back at one of the earliest significant encounters with Western naval power, framing Chosŏn's "Hermit Kingdom" status and offering a glimpse into how Korea was represented abroad, even reaching the famous Napoleon. It also preserves details from early Western accounts (Hall and MacLeod's narratives) for a Korean audience.

『나팔륜』과 朝鮮
						金東成
19世紀의 初葉 즉 1816년(純祖16년) 英國軍艦 리라·알세스트 兩艦은 中國을 거처 朝鮮을 방문케 되얏다. 9월 1일 朝 黃海道 沿岸 北徫 37度 45·東經124度 40의 지점에 投錨하고 船員이 上陸을 하려는 즈음에 島民은 言語不通으로 手로써 自己頸部를 가르처 斬首한다는 形容으로 上陸을 極力拒絶하엿다. 英國船員은 暴力을 사용할 수도 업는 터이고 부득이 그 지점에서 拔錨하야 4일 忠淸道 安眼島 附近 一灣에 도착한 바 水深 6尋 前面에 大村落을 발견하엿다. 夕刻에 6,7隻의 小舟는 多數從者를 携한 一官吏가 리라號에 上船하야 甲板上에서 提督과 面會하엿고 다시 알세스트號를 방문하엿다. 그런데 알세스트號에서 下船할 때 從者一人이 些細한 過失이 잇슴을 理由 小舟중에서 즉 決刑罰에 處하야 衆人環視中 笞10餘를 執行하엿다. 노인인 官員은 王者에 不下하는 威風을 但備하엿다. 外艦監視의 目的으로 數隻의 小舟는 리락號 周圍에 徹宵 假泊하엿고 翌朝老翁은 昨日보다도 多數한 隨員을 從하고 對岸村落에서 乘船하고 리락號를 再訪하야 甲板上에서 朝食을 畢하고 全船員數 大砲 小銃등의 長斷其他事項을 隨員중 一人의 秘書로 記述케 하고 船長은 官員의 희망에 의하야 大破一發을 發射하엿다. 물론 一同은 이에 驚愕하엿다.
朝食후 船長은 幕僚를 隨하고 上陸코자 端艇을 乘하엿다. 老翁은 他艦에 赴하는 줄로 誤認하고 同乘하엿다가 漸次 海岸에 接見하야 上陸코자 함으로 翁은 頭를 흔드러 반대하엿다. 그럼에도 불구하고 船員이 上陸함으로 老官은 俯垂悄然하야 悲歎을 不堪하는 姿態이엇다. 異國人의 上陸에 의하야 自國에 一大凶事가 勃發하는 줄로 녁이는 態度이엇다. 雲集하는 군상을 士卒은 此를 喝退하엿다.
船員의 惡意업는 表示에도 不拘하고 老官은 4일후면 首府의 指令으로 자기가 斬首를 당한다고 前進을 久許치 아님으로 一行은 歸船하엿다.
알세스트號까지 從來한 老官은 耶穌敎 聖經 一冊을 受取하엿다.＜156＞
5일 오후 拔錨하야 群島를 貫通南下하엿는대 島는 海중에 屹立하고 長 3,4哩 이상에 及하는 者 殆無하엿다. 島上은 多少耕作 되엿고 住民은 各島頂上에 蝟集하야 艦隊通過를 遠望하엿다.
8일 北 3,4度 地点에 投錨하엿다. 그 부근 島嶼는 약 20에 及하엿다. 此處에서 各種觀察及測量을 행하고 島의 位置投錨地의 상태를 實證하고 特長잇는 地点에는 장래를 위하야 英語名稱까지 附하엿다.
엇던 島嶼에든지 上陸코자하면 島民은 手로써 斯首의 形容을 하야 拒絶하면서도 飮料水 혹은 質粗한 食物을 齋來하는 일도 잇섯다. 此等島民과 接觸으로써 政治 風俗 習慣을 正確히 談話하기는 도저히 불가능 하엿다.
隱士國의 별명이 잇는 朝鮮에 上陸 不可能함으로 沿海測量에 朝鮮방문의 艦隊目的은 긋치고 10일 朝鮮海를 玄하야 琉球 廣東 마닐라 希望峯을 經由하야 英國에 歸還하엿다. 도중 리리號는 翌1817년 8월 11일 大西洋上의 一孤島 聖헬레나에 寄港하얏다. 때는 마츰 奈巴崙大帝가 이 孤島에 幽閉되엿다. 리라號 艦長 베실·홀氏는 廢帝에 面謁을 엇고 巡航한 朝鮮과 琉球事情을 禀告하면서 寫生한 朝鮮風景及風俗畵를 提出하게 되얏다. 其中 朝鮮人을 錨寫한 繪畵一枚는 특히 廢帝의 興趣를 催한 듯이 親히 手로 取하야 曰 大帽子를 戴한 白髮老人이군=長煙管을 가젓서 中國風의 席과 服裝=從者가 무엇을 記述하는군=分明히 描寫하야 참으로 傑作이다 라 하엿다. 朝鮮의 關한 奈巴崙에 言辭는 이번이 最初일 것이다.(알세스트號 乘組軍醫막클레오드氏의 航海記 중에서).＜157＞
