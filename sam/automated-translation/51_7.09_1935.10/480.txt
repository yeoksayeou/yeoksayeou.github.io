往生極樂하옵소서
						金岸曙

왼하로 길을것다 쉬든늙은이
풍풍소리 웬일가 돌아를보니, 自動車오네.
혼자탄식 身勢를 설어하는말,
『저車를 집어타면 서울五百里
단숨결에 갈 것을 돈이원수라.』

『車타고 가시지요 車가볏스니,
노랑볏 이저녁에 어이것겟소 어서탑시요.』
고마워라 運轉手 은근한말에
늙은이 히룩버룩 올으고보니
아차失手 웬일가 靈樞車로세. ＜240＞

May You Attain Rebirth in Paradise
						Kim An-sŏ

An old man, resting after walking all day,
*Whirr, whirr* – what sound is that? He turns to look, an automobile (自動車) approaches.
Lamenting his own situation (身勢), he speaks ruefully,
“If I could just catch that car (車), Seoul (서울), five hundred *ri* away,
I could reach in a single breath, but money is the enemy.”

“Please get in the car (車), sir, the car is empty.
At your advanced age, how can you walk this evening? Please, get in.”
Grateful for the driver’s (運轉手) kind words,
The old man clumsily climbs aboard, and then—
Oh dear, a mistake (失手)! What is this? It’s a hearse (靈樞車). <240>

**Summary**

This poem by Kim An-sŏ tells a short, ironic story. An elderly man, weary from walking, sees a car and laments his poverty, wishing he could afford a ride to Seoul. A driver kindly offers him a lift in his empty car. The old man gratefully accepts, only to realize with shock that he has boarded a hearse. The poem uses the juxtaposition of modern technology (the car) and the old man's poverty to highlight social disparity, concluding with a darkly humorous twist related to the poem's title. For historians, it offers a glimpse into the early adoption of automobiles in Korea, the perception of distance before widespread modern transport (Seoul being 500 *ri*), the persistence of poverty, and perhaps a fatalistic commentary on life and death during the colonial period.
