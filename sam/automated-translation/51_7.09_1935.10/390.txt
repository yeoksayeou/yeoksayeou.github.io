**Body Text Translation**
Seoul Song
						By Sin Pulch'ul

Though they say a mirror is good because it's clear,
It's flawed because it reflects back-to-front.
Eheyah, this is what Seoul is like.

Unable to live without talking about others,
Here in Seoul, there's so much gossip.
Eheyah, this is what Seoul is like.

Those who live attached to alcohol and tobacco,
Their numbers grow endlessly day by day.
Eheyah, this is what Seoul is like.

The elementary school student's lunchbox is utterly empty,
But the drums at the restaurant beat loudly, tang-tang.
Eheyah, this is what Seoul is like.

Though snow may fall on the parents' faces (i.e., they age and worry),
Only flowers bloom on the faces of sons and daughters.
Eheyah, this is what Seoul is like.<196>

**Summary**

This poem offers a cynical and critical perspective on life in Seoul during the mid-1930s. It portrays the city as superficial (like a reversed mirror image), rife with gossip, prone to vices like drinking and smoking, marked by stark contrasts between poverty (empty lunchboxes) and indulgent entertainment (restaurant drums), and characterized by a younger generation seemingly indifferent to the struggles of their elders. From a historical perspective, the poem is interesting for its social commentary on the rapid urbanization and modernization occurring under colonial rule. It highlights perceived moral decay, growing materialism, changing social dynamics (gossip culture), and intergenerational tensions, reflecting the anxieties and societal shifts experienced by Koreans in the colonial capital.

서울노래
						申不出
거울이 맑어서 좋타해도
뒤집어 빛이니 탈이로다
에헤야 이것이 서울이란다

남의말 않하곤 못사는지
이곳의 서울엔 말도많치
에헤야 이것이 서울이란다

술담배 정붙어 사는이가
하로도 수없이 느러간다
에헤야 이것이 서울이란다

소학생 벤또는 텡텡비고
요리점 장구는 탕탕운다
에헤야 이것이 서울이란다

어버이 얼굴에 눈이와도
아들딸 얼골엔 꽃만펴라
이헤야 이것이 서울이란다＜196＞
