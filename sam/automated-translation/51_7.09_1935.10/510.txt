Mountain Rain
						Yi Pyŏnggi (李秉岐)
Having seen Myohwa, moonlight in a dream, unable to fully fall back into lingering sleep,
Why are the sounds of the bell, the sounds of Buddhist chants so clamorous?
And over Nakchot'ae (落照臺) and Ssangsŏnbong (雙仙峯), is the rain also falling?

The rain is falling, and the mountain grows ever more still.
Taking down the monk's robe (袈裟) hanging on the wall and putting it on, holding a wooden handbell (木鐸) in one hand,
I want to kneel before the Buddha and chant prayers (念佛).
-The above is at Wŏlmyŏngam (月明庵)

The narrow stone path suddenly rises and falls,
Wide tree leaves brush against the forehead,
And jewel-like clear water drops, drip, drip, drip, are heard.

At the edge of potato, millet, and bean fields, two or three thatched houses (草家집),
Chicks, their feathers wet, doze in the yard,
And a humble old man, all alone, comes out stooping.<243>

**Summary**

This poem by Yi Pyŏnggi depicts the serene yet melancholic atmosphere of a rainy day in the mountains, shifting focus from a Buddhist hermitage (Wŏlmyŏngam) to the simple rural landscape below. The first part evokes contemplation within the hermitage, contrasting the inner desire for quiet prayer with the external sounds of rain and temple bells. The second part describes the descent, focusing on the tactile and auditory experience of the rain on a mountain path and observing a quiet, humble village scene. For historians, the poem offers a glimpse into the persistence of traditional Korean aesthetics—nature appreciation, Buddhist themes, and pastoral imagery—during the Japanese colonial period. Its focus on introspection and the quiet beauty of the Korean landscape, rendered partly in older Korean orthography and Hanja, can be seen as a subtle assertion of cultural identity amidst colonial pressures, finding solace and meaning away from the imposed modernity.

山ㅅ비
						李秉岐
妙花, 月明 꿈에 보고 덧드는잠 못다들어
鍾소리 禮佛소리 웨그리 요란하고
落照臺 雙仙峯으로 비는 또한 나리는고.」

비는 나리시고 山은 더욱 적적하다
벽에 걸린 袈裟를 나려입고 한손에 木鐸들고
부처님 앞에 꿇어앉어 念佛이나 하고싶다.
-以上은 月明庵

돌바닥 좁은 길이 갑작이 높다 낮다
넓€ 나무닢이 이마에 부드치고
玉같은 맑은 물방울 똑똑 똑똑 듯는다.

감자, 조, 콩밭머리 草家집두어가호
병아리 깃이 젖어 뜰엉에 졸고 있고
헙술한 늙은이 혼자, 구벅데고 나온다.＜243＞
