Company Notice

Mr. Kim Tongin's (金東仁氏) "A Study of Ch'unwŏn" (「春園砒究」) will be suspended due to circumstances (事情).

Samch'ŏlli Company Editorial Department (三千里社編輯局) <269>

**Summary**

This brief notice from the Samch'ŏlli Company Editorial Department announces the suspension of the serialization of Kim Tongin's work, "A Study of Ch'unwŏn," citing unspecified "circumstances." Ch'unwŏn was the pen name of Yi Kwangsu, a major figure in modern Korean literature. This suspension is interesting to historians as it points towards potential external pressures (like censorship) or internal conflicts impacting literary publications during the Japanese colonial period. The abrupt halt of a potentially critical study of a prominent writer by another well-known author highlights the sensitive environment for intellectual and literary discourse at the time.
