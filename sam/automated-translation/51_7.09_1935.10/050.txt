Ceremony Held Grandly by the Sixth Governor-General on the 25th Anniversary of the Inauguration of Government

The ceremony commemorating the 25th anniversary of the Government-General's administration was held starting at 9:00 AM on October 1st in the East Plaza of the Government-General building. As the appointed time approached, representatives of the Prime Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Minister of Colonial Affairs (拓務大臣) (these three acting as proxies), former Governor-General Saitō, former Police Affairs Bureau Chiefs Maruyama and Asari, former Governor Nakano, who came specially from Tōkyō, officials who had served in the Government-General over the past 25 years, and 3,000 guests from the business and media circles gathered. From the organizers' side, Governor-General Ugaki, Political Affairs Superintendent Imaida, and officials from all government offices were present. As the ceremony began, Governor-General Ugaki respectfully read the Imperial Rescript on the Annexation of Korea (日韓倂合 詔書), followed by Superintendent Imaida's reading of the ceremonial address. Afterwards, there was the bestowal of imperial awards (賞賜御吩付) to a dozen civilian meritorious individuals, followed by the presentation of commendations to approximately 5,000 meritorious government officials with long service and filial sons and virtuous wives (孝子節婦). After that, there were congratulatory addresses from each minister's representative, Ambassador Viscount Saitō, Ambassador Plenipotentiary Minami, Army Commander Ueda, and the Soviet Consul General. The ceremony concluded successfully at 11:10 AM. On that day, Governor-General Ugaki issued the following proclamation (諭告) to the officials and people within the territory.

Governor-General Ugaki's Proclamation (Excerpt) -On the 25th Anniversary Commemoration Day-

In general, the broad outline of governance in Chosŏn relies on the grand design (宏謨) of the annexation, and all various administrative affairs (庶政) stem from this. Since the first Governor-General, those who have assumed the position of governance have succeeded in rule, dedicating themselves to maintaining peace and order and nurturing the populace (民黎), thereby cultivating the foundation for prosperity (興隆).
Currently, the Empire (帝國) faces an international situation rife with the crisis of external troubles (外禍機). Bearing the grave responsibility of securing peace in East Asia (東洋平和) by acting independently (自主獨往), internally, it is now the time to establish great principles (經倫) and plan for the expansion of the national destiny (國運).
Officials and civilians within the territory (疆內官民), understand this intention well, cooperate (協戮), and elevate yourselves (昻).
October 1, Shōwa 10 (1935)
Governor-General of Chosŏn, Ugaki Kazushige

Memorial Ceremony, Garden Party, Flag Procession
As the aforementioned commemorative ceremony concluded, it immediately moved to the Kŭnjŏngjŏn Hall for a memorial ceremony (招魂祭) for deceased meritorious individuals and those who died in the line of duty (殉職者). With the envoy from the Royal House (王家御使), all participants from the commemorative ceremony, and bereaved families in attendance, Governor-General Ugaki acted as the chief priest (祭主) and performed the ritual offering (玉串奉奠). Following this, a grand congratulatory garden party (祝賀大園遊會) was held in the Rear Garden (後庭) of Kyŏngbok Palace. Starting from 1:00 PM, there was a flag procession (旗行列) of 60,000 students. Thus, this day's 25th Anniversary of Government Commemoration ended successfully amidst celebrations by both officials and civilians. <41>

**Summary**

This news report details the grand ceremony held on October 1, 1935, marking the 25th anniversary of Japanese colonial rule (始政) in Korea, presided over by the 6th Governor-General, Ugaki Kazushige. It describes the attendees, including high-ranking Japanese officials (both current and former), local dignitaries, and thousands of guests, the sequence of events including the reading of the annexation rescript, award ceremonies for collaborators and long-serving officials, and congratulatory speeches. Governor-General Ugaki's proclamation urged Koreans to understand Japan's imperial ambitions in East Asia and cooperate. The day concluded with a Shinto memorial service, a garden party at Kyŏngbok Palace, and a large flag procession involving tens of thousands of students. From a historical perspective, the article vividly illustrates the Japanese colonial administration's efforts to legitimize and celebrate its rule, emphasizing imperial authority (reading the rescript, imperial awards), co-opting Korean elites and symbols (holding events at Kyŏngbok Palace, involving the Yi Royal House envoy), rewarding collaborators, and mobilizing the population (especially students) for state propaganda events like the flag procession. The language used, including Ugaki's proclamation, reveals the ideological justifications for Japanese expansionism and the expectation of Korean subservience and cooperation within the Empire.
