歸烏有詠 三十韻, 壬申舊稿
						梧村 薜泰熙

In the year Ŭlch'uk (1925), I entered this land,
Buying fields and paths, exhausting my meager strength.
Backing the mountain, facing the field, I built a farmhouse,
Dividing the area for a village of ten households.
Calling forth those without land to till,
Men carrying burdens, women bearing loads, they came from all directions.
Their burdens and loads insufficient for clothing and food needs,
Their pots and pans no more than discarded, broken materials.
The morning after arriving, they nearly had no fire to cook,
Eating alone seemed heartless, yet chasing them away was also sorrowful.
Calculating daily needs, millet was supplied per person,
Japanese cloth (倭布) was measured by the foot for each body.
Smoking tobacco and eating shrimp were still not abandoned,
Whenever hearing a vendor's call, they'd plead, calling me "Grandfather" (爺).
Neighboring women and children called me "Great Grandfather" (大爺),
Not only this, but matters of clothing, food, housing, cattle, livestock, tools, and utensils were also looked after.
Trying to shelter them with short wings was beyond my capacity,
Once spread out dancing, it could not be retracted.
Where human feelings are rarely generous,
The men of the village all submitted their hearts.
Friendships were based on trust and harmony, conduct followed rules,
A kye (契) was established, promising mutual aid.
I took it upon myself to teach children reading and arithmetic,
Gathering children for night lessons in various writings, arithmetic, etc.
Planning for public benefit through the township association (面社),
Establishing a township store (面商店), setting up a village kye (洞契) with substantial private funds,
Collecting interest through the village kye, thus soon the village customs became beautiful.
The old man (阿翁 - referring to himself) was overjoyed beyond measure.
Unexpectedly, a drought continued for three years,
Both host (myself) and guests (villagers) suffered calamity together.
Moreover, some appointed position was unjust,
The township association ultimately could not be maintained.
Heaven did not aid what the old man planned,
People did not understand what the old man intended.
Heaven did not aid, people did not comprehend,
Why must the old man harbor resentment himself?
In Shinmi year (1931), half the land went to the Sikŭn (殖銀 - Industrial Bank of Joseon),
In Imshin year (1932), the remaining fields went to the Kwŏnsa Taegŭm Hoesa (勸司貸金會社 - Loan Company).
The old man feels neither sorrow nor joy about having land or not,
It was merely using a butcher's knife meant for an ox to kill a chicken.
Even killing the chicken was not accomplished properly.
Whether the group of cattle remains or not, I now doubt myself.
Returning to Seoul (京) for over a year, I visited the villa again,
Seven households had left, three remained.
I asked the three about the movements of the seven who left,
They only spoke of seeking food, not of admiration (欽).
How could there be such a materialistic view of history (唯物史觀)?
Birds and beasts are not rhinoceroses, yet they are compared uniformly.
The old man does not lament the loss of land,
The old man laments the loss of people.
Virtuous neighbors are unproven where money holds sway;<94>
How can kind feelings be discussed amidst power and profit?
How can this world achieve equal sustenance for the people,
Making people hopefully emulate the surrender of Jiang Wei (降裏)?
Eight years of hard work, what has it become?
Barely clearing the wilderness, it returns to nothingness (烏有).
The most unforgettable thing is one matter:
Tending the garden and cultivating the vegetable plot, I poured my heart into it for long.
Let others change it as they please,
Passersby should comment on the change of owners.
Someday, amid the grass colors of Hup'yŏng (後坪),
I wish to preserve the name chosen by Master Su (蘇公 - Su Shi/Su Dongpo).

戊辰春自京歸後坪山庄
(Spring of Muchin [1928], Returning to Hup'yŏng Mountain Villa from Seoul)

Riding an ox late at night,
The journey along the road is so slow.
Approximately verifying by the sound of the stream,
Knowing the village by the barking dogs.
My young grandson climbs onto his mother to wait,
The old servant runs towards me.
Entering the room, we open up with talk and laughter,
Instantly forgetting the fatigue.

己已春於山庄收繭出賣
(Spring of Kisa [1929], Selling Cocoons Harvested at the Mountain Villa)

A box full of silver pearls, thousands upon thousands,
Every single one came from diligent effort.
The elderly should rightly be clothed in silk,
But unbearable remaining debts forced their sale.

見貸農打麥勘稅有感
(Thoughts upon Seeing Tenant Farmers Threshing Wheat and Being Assessed for Taxes)

Frozen shoots barely sprouted, now growing somewhat well,
If not sold, making porridge would still be possible.
Hating the tax official, fierce as a tiger,
After the harvest, grain is reduced and paid with a generous measure (升).

辛未冬在後坪庄
(Winter of Shinmi [1931], at Hup'yŏng Villa)

Staying in the gorge over ten days, naturally unhurried,
Having adapted, there's no resentment, so what of it?
Playing with ideas in leisure is all my gain,
Thinking of poetry in stillness, awareness dawns like clearing thatch.
The mountain night seems like a year due to the changing year,
Village rice wine (醪) seems like sweet nectar, making me forget the cup.
A dog barks at the brushwood gate, not a stranger,
I know it's a neighbor returning from selling charcoal.<95>

修慧 花谷 尹益善
(Suhye Hwagok Yun Ikson)

Lighting a lamp, sitting silently * smoking incense,
The morning bell from the highest peak regrets drunken eyes.
In the shade of the Bodhi tree of afflictions, sharpen the keen chisel,
On the sea of greed and anger, moor the light boat.
Gold and silver transform in the red furnace fire,
Stars and moon hide their light in the daytime sky.
Gradually emerging beyond Śrāvaka (聲聞) and Pratyekabuddha (緣覺),
A patch of bright vermillion reveals the mind-field.

持戎
(Chiyung - Holding the Spear/Maintaining Vigilance)

Wishing to obtain the solemn foundation of myriad virtues,
The warship sets sail for the land of Nirvana (捏槃地).
Stay far from guests seeking fragrance by carving dung,
Do not be a child who steams sand trying to make rice.
The other shore gradually opens as the rain of anger ceases,
The deluded ferry crossing recedes as the wind of wisdom blows.
Leisurely listening to two or three boat songs (棹歌),
Floating on that steady stream, do not forget danger.

不言實行主義 小坡 韓準錫
(Silent Action Principle - Sop'a Han Chunsŏk)

Not speaking, but when speaking, it must hit the mark.
People do not tire of such words.
When speaking, one must consider actions.
How can action lie in many words?<96>
<94-96>

**Summary**

The main poem by Sŏl T'aehŭi recounts his ambitious but ultimately failed project to establish a self-sufficient farming village near Ch'ŏrwŏn. He describes attracting landless peasants, setting up infrastructure and mutual aid systems (kye), and his initial optimism. However, drought and unspecified "unjust" appointments led to failure, culminating in the loss of his land to colonial financial institutions (likely the Industrial Bank of Joseon and another loan company). He expresses greater sorrow for the dispersal of the people than the loss of the land itself, reflecting bitterly on the dominance of money over human feeling and virtue. Subsequent shorter poems depict scenes of rural life – returning home, the economic pressure forcing the sale of silk cocoons, the harshness of tax collection – and philosophical or Buddhist reflections. Historians might find the explicit mention of land loss to specific types of colonial financial entities (殖銀, 勸司貸金會社) and the description of attempting community building under difficult colonial conditions particularly valuable. The poems offer a personal perspective on the socio-economic struggles and disillusionment experienced by some Koreans, including landowners, during the Japanese occupation.

歸烏有詠 三十韻, 壬申舊稿
						梧村 薜泰熙
乙丑年間入此地 買取阡陌費力孱. 背山臨野築農舍
一村十戶分區寰. 招到無土可畊者 男負女載四方來.
負戴不足衣食需 瓢鼎莫過廢破材. 來居翌朝殆絶火
獨食情難逐亦哀. 胡粟算日計口給 倭布隨身量尺該.
吸煙啖鰕猶不廢 每聽販聲呼爺求 隣家婦童呼我大爺 不寧惟此衣食住 牛畜器具且兼謀. 短翼於蔽非所及 張舞之旣不可收. 人情罕薄所厚處 一村男歸皆服心. 友交信睦行有規 設契相約互助 童蒙書數敎自任 集兒童夜課諸文算術等 策立面社謀公利 立面商店 備設洞契厚私資 設洞契取息 如此未幾洞風美
阿翁喜不自勝之. 不圖天旱連三載 主客興同發瘡夷.
又何所任有不正 面社終是未維持. 阿翁所謀天不助
阿翁所圖人不知. 天不助矣人不諳 阿翁何須自含怨.
辛未半土入殖銀 壬申餘田歸勸司貸金會社 翁不悲喜土有無
祗應牛刀割鷄爲. 割鷄亦張不成了. 牛群與否却自疑.
還京年餘再到庄 去者七戶居者三. 問三問七去動止
祗說求食不說欽. 唯物史觀寧有是 鳥獸不犀一例喩.
翁不以失土爲* 翁可以失人爲吁. 德隣無徵金力界＜94＞
情善奚論勢利中. 安得斯世均民食 使人庶幾效降裏.
八載辛苦成何事 才開荒蕪歸烏有. 最是難忘有一事
園裁圃治傾心久. 任他變匠隨意作 行人應道昜主評
他日後坪草色裡. 願存蘇公擇勝名.

戊辰春自京歸後坪山庄
騎牛深夜之 歷路太遲遲. 約略川聲驗
閭閻犬吠知. 穉孫登母候 老僕向吾馳.
入室開言笑 卽時忘困疲.

己已春於山庄收繭出賣
滿箱銀顆萬千枚 箇箇無非勉苦來. 所當老者宜衣帛 殘債難堪遂賣迴.

見貸農打麥勘稅有感
凍設殘芽稍好登 若令不糶粥還能. 生憎稅吏威如虎 歇後減糧付厚升.

辛未冬在後坪庄
居峽踰旬自不催 習能無憫亦何哉. 閑中玩意皆吾益 靜裏思詩覺茅開. 山夜如年因換秩 村醪似醴却忘盃. 紫門犬吠非他客 知是隣人販炭迴.＜95＞

修慧 花谷 尹益善
點燈黙坐*香烟, 太上晨鍾憾醉眼.
煩惱樹陰磨利鍥, 貪嗔海上艤輕船.
金銀變態紅爐火, 星月隱光白日天.
漸出聲聞緣覺外, 明朱一片露心田.

持戎
願得莊嚴萬善基, 戎船出帆捏槃地.
遠離刻糞求香客, 莫作蒸沙作飯兒.
彼岸漸開嗔雨歇, 迷津稍遠慧風吹.
棹歌閒聽兩三曲, 泛彼穩流不忘危.

不言實行主義 小坡 韓準錫

不言言必中
人不厭其言
出言必顧行
行豈在多言＜96＞
＜94-96＞
