Heard Tidbits (風月記)
Tōyama Mitsuru's story of Kim Okkyun
Someone visited the elder Tōyama Mitsuru (頭山滿翁) in Tōkyō, and when the conversation turned to Kim Okkyun (金玉均), he reportedly expressed his admiration several times, saying:
"Kim Okkyun was certainly a great man (豪傑)."
"There's hardly another person as capable as him throughout history, East or West. He was capable of anything."
"Talented men are usually weak, but that man was extremely strong. And when it came to courage (膽力), he was astonishingly so."

Mr. Kim Yaksu and the Military Academy
Mr. Kim Yaksu (金若水), harboring the grand ambition (雄圖) of becoming an Army General (陸軍大將), went to Tōkyō seeking admission to the Military Academy (士官學校), but at that time, Korean youths were not readily admitted to the regular course (正科). So, intending to go to Manchuria (滿洲), he came as far as Antung Prefecture (安東縣), but at the station, his bag containing his travel expenses (旅費) was unfortunately stolen. Dumbfounded, he stared at the blue sky (靑天) for a while, then went down to the white sandy shores of the Yalu River (鴨綠江), took a bath, washed his trousers in the river water and put them on, and spent the whole day whistling by the riverside.

Smiling Without Answering, the Heart is Content (笑而不答心自悅)
Regarding Ms. Pak Ŭnhye (朴恩蕙), who came from America (米國) and about whom rumors of engagement with Mr. Chang Tŏksu (張德秀) are circulating:
When asked, "Is it true you're getting married?"
She just smiles.
When asked, "Is the rumor about the engagement being called off true?"
She merely smiles again. Though there's no way to fathom the beautiful lady's heart (佳人中心), it can be called a case of 'Smiling without answering, the heart is content' (笑而不答 心自悅格).

Zen Dialogue (仙問答)
At a gathering, lawyer Mr. Yi In (李仁) said to Mr. Sŏ Ch'un (徐椿), the chief editor (主筆) of the Chōsen Nippō (朝鮮日報):
"Other newspapers are flying airplanes even to Paektu Mountain (白頭山), why doesn't your newspaper try flying one to Kŭmgang Mountain (金剛山)?"
To which [Sŏ Ch'un replied], "Hey, don't say that. Our newspaper doesn't go where people can climb on their own two feet. If we fly, we fly to the sky, not merely Paektu." <55>

Mr. Kim Kyŏngjae's Trip to Treasure Island (寶島行)
When one speaks of a "treasure-buried island" (보배파뭇긴 섬) in this world, one usually imagines the Count of Monte Cristo from *Neptune* (海王星 - likely a reference to the novel *The Count of Monte Cristo*) and the treasure buried in the Mediterranean Sea. Now, the critic Mr. Kim Kyŏngjae (金璟載) seems to be dreaming of just such a "Treasure Island" (寶島) and is planning a thousand-league expedition. What this means is that after Mr. Kim finished Suwŏn High Agricultural School (水原高農) and set his sights on international affairs (國際風雲), he reached the plains of North Manchuria (北滿洲) in his early twenties. There, he met Yu Tongyŏl (柳東悅). Near the Mutan River (牧丹江), they encountered a Dutchman who had been running a large ranch (牧場). As the Great European War (歐洲大戰) broke out, the Dutchman intended to return home. They bought the entire property – farm, ranch, everything, totaling 3,000 *ilgeng* (日耕 - approximately 3,000 days' worth of plowing, a unit of land area) – for 1,300 won. The plan at that time was to use this as capital for further ventures.

However, worldly affairs (世事) flow like water (流水) without stopping. Yu Tongyŏl left, Kim also left, and moreover, the Manchurian Incident (滿洲事變) occurred, completely changing the general situation (大勢). Nearly 20 years have passed until today. But a clear fact, enduring like the sun and moon (日月), is that the 3,000 *ilgeng* of land was purchased under the names of Yu and Kim. Trusting in Manchukuo (滿洲國), where the law is said to be clear (昭昭), he is now packing his bundles and heading to North Manchuria (北滿洲行) these days to reclaim that land.

If this land can indeed be recovered, even receiving just 100 won per *kari* (가리 - perhaps referring to a smaller land unit or yield measure?) would yield 300,000 to 400,000 won. Is it true, or is it false? Let's wait and see. <59>

**Summary**

This article presents a collection of short news items and anecdotes from 1935 colonial Korea. It covers diverse topics: Japanese nationalist Tōyama Mitsuru's admiration for the 19th-century Korean reformer Kim Okkyun; Kim Yaksu's thwarted ambition to attend the Japanese Military Academy and subsequent misfortune in Manchuria; social gossip surrounding Pak Ŭnhye and Chang Tŏksu; a witty exchange reflecting newspaper rivalry between the Chōsen Nippō and others; and critic Kim Kyŏngjae's plan to reclaim land in Manchukuo purchased two decades earlier with Yu Tongyŏl before the Manchurian Incident. These snippets offer insights into the Korean elite's interactions with Japanese figures, the limitations and opportunities faced by Koreans under colonial rule (especially regarding military careers and ventures in Manchuria), social life, and the impact of major geopolitical events like World War I and the establishment of Manchukuo on individual lives and property claims. Historians might find the diverse perspectives—Japanese views on Korean figures, Korean aspirations abroad, social dynamics, and the tangible consequences of political shifts in Manchuria—particularly interesting.

드른 風月記
頭山滿의 金玉均이약이
누가 東京잇는 頭山滿翁을 차저 갓더니 말이 金玉均에 미치매 그는
「金玉均は 確カに 豪カツタネ.」
「アンナニ 出來ル 人物ハ古 今東西ヲ通ジテ 一寸アルマイ, 何ンテモ 出來タカラナ.」
「才士ハ 大抵 弱インタケレトモ ソノ人ハ トテモ强イ, ソシテ 膽力ノアルユトト言ツタラ 見違フ程テアツタ.」라고 여러번 敬服하더라고.

金若水氏와 士官學校
金若水씨가 陸軍大將이 될 雄圖?를 품고 東京 가서 士官學校에 입학하려 차저갓더니 그때는 조선 청년을 正科에 잘 드리지 안엇다. 그래서 滿洲로 나간다고 安東縣까지 왓다가 정거장에서 그만 旅費를 너흔 가방을 도적마첫다. 긔가 막혀 한참 靑天하늘을 처다보다가 鴨綠江 백사불에 내려가서 목욕을 한바탕하고, 바지를 강물에 빨어 입고, 종일 강변에서 휘파람 불며 지냇다고.

笑而不答心自悅
張德秀씨와 약혼설이 傳하는 米國서 가지 나온 朴恩蕙씨더러
「시집가신다니 참말이서요」
하고 물어도 빙그레.
「約婚解消說이 잇스니 정말이세요.」
하여도 빙그레 웃을 뿐, 佳人中心을 忖度할 길이 업지만 可謂笑而不答 心自悅格.

仙問答
어느 一席에서 辯護士 李仁씨가 朝鮮日報 主筆 徐椿씨더러
「남의 신문사에서는 白頭山까지에 비행기를 날닌다는데 자네 신문서는 金剛山에나 날려보지 한즉
「여보게 말말게, 우리 신문서는 사람이 제발로 오를 수 잇는데는 안간다데, 뜨면 하늘로 뜨지 겨우 白頭이야.」＜55＞

金璟載氏의 寶島行
이 세상의 「보배파뭇긴 섬」이라 하면 대개 海王星에 나오는 몬트, 크리스트 伯爵이 地中海바다에 海牙法使가 뭇는 그들 연상하는데 이제 評論家 金璟載氏가 마치 이 「寶島」 한 개를 꿈꾸고 천리원정을 계획하고 잇다. 이게 무슨 말인가 하면 氏가 水原高農을 맛치고 國際風雲에 뜻을 두고서 20內外의 청년시대에 다다른 곳이 北滿洲벌판이라, 거기에서 柳東悅이를 맛낫는데 두 분은 牧丹江 부근에서 和蘭사람이 큰 牧장 경영을 하다가 歐洲大戰이 터지자 귀국하겟다는 것을 맛나서 그 농장, 목장, 모다 합해서 3천日耕이나 되는 큰 것을 통트러 1,300원을 주고 삿는데 그때 게획은 그를 미천으로 하여 엇지엇지하겟다고 한 것이다.
그러나 世事는 流水갓치 流不止라, 流東悅이도 떠나고 金도 떠나고 더구나 滿洲事變까지 이러나 大勢가 웬통 달너저-오늘까지 20年 갓가운 세월이 지나갓다. 그러나 日月로 더부러 뚜렷한 사실은 3천日耕 土地를 柳金들의 명의로 사논 사실이라. 법이 昭昭하다는 滿洲國을 밋고 그 땅을 도로 찻고저 요지음 봇다리 질머지고 北滿洲行을 한다고.
만일 이 땅이 차저만 진다면 하로 가리에 100원씩만 바더도 3, 40만원 돈이 떠러지리라고 참말일가, 거짓말일가, 두고나 보지?＜59＞
