On the Kyŏngbu Line Train.
"Hey, when taking the train, you should absolutely never ride in the very last car. If the train overturns or derails, it's always the last passenger car that meets with disaster."
"Well then, if it's so dangerous, wouldn't it be perfectly safe if they just didn't attach the last passenger car at all?"

Although They Kissed
Kich'ang: "Miss Okpong, they say it's easy to get sick if you kiss. Do you believe that?"
Okpong: "Oh my, how embarrassing, I don't know about such things. I still..."
Kich'ang (greatly pleased): "You still haven't kissed before?"
Okpong: "Well, I've never gotten sick..."

Of Course
After two educators had boasted at length about how well they educated their respective sons.
"Excuse me, but does your son smoke?"
"Good heavens, no! Smoke? He even hates the smell of smoke (연궀°)."
"Then what about drinking or visiting Kisaeng houses?"
"Not even in his dreams!"
"Truly admirable. So, he doesn't go wandering about at night either, I suppose."
"Absolutely not. As soon as he finishes dinner, he goes right to sleep."
"You've truly educated him well. So, how old is he this year?"
"He's two this year."

Asking Was the Mistake
The teacher asks a student:
"We eat the meat of animals. And do you know what we do with the bones?"
Student: "Yes, we neatly push them aside to one corner of the plate."<83>

**Summary**

This article presents four short, humorous anecdotes or jokes typical of the time. The first discusses the perceived danger of the last train car, the second is a witty exchange about kissing and illness, the third reveals a father's pride in his "well-behaved" son who is only two years old, and the fourth is a student's literal answer about disposing of bones. From a historical perspective, these snippets offer a glimpse into everyday humor and social interactions during the Japanese colonial period in Korea. They also showcase the Korean language as it was written and spoken in the early 1930s, including older orthography and expressions, which is valuable for linguistic study. The mention of the Kyŏngbu Line contextualizes the setting.
