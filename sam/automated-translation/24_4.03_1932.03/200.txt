According to information recently received by the Manchurian Compatriots Problem Consultation Committee, the number of people housed in various camps across Manchuria is approximately 14,189. The food supply situation differs in each camp, but generally, 4 or 5 *chŏn* up to 7 or 8 *chŏn* per person per day is provided, allowing each individual to eat as they wish. The foodstuffs are said to be sorghum (高粱) and millet (栗). Due to the lack of medical treatment in each camp, leprosy patients (나병자) are appearing one after another. Regarding the trend of illnesses, deaths from infectious diseases such as measles (痲疹) and pneumonia (폐염) already number in the hundreds. Mr. Kim Tak-wŏn, urgently dispatched just now by the Kyŏngsŏng Manchurian Compatriots Problem Consultation Committee, is reportedly striving to provide circuit medical treatment. <54>

**Summary**

This news brief from March 1932 reports on the dire conditions faced by approximately 14,189 Korean refugees housed in camps across Manchuria. Food rations are meager (4-8 *chŏn* daily per person, consisting mainly of sorghum and millet), and inadequate medical care has led to outbreaks of infectious diseases like measles and pneumonia, resulting in hundreds of deaths. Leprosy cases are also reported. Relief efforts include the dispatch of Mr. Kim Tak-wŏn by the Seoul-based Manchurian Compatriots Problem Consultation Committee to provide medical assistance. For historians, this article offers a stark glimpse into the humanitarian crisis affecting Korean migrants and refugees in Manchuria during a period of significant upheaval (following the Mukden Incident of 1931), highlighting their vulnerability, the inadequate relief infrastructure, and early organized responses from Korea. The mention of specific diseases and death tolls provides concrete data on the severity of the situation.
