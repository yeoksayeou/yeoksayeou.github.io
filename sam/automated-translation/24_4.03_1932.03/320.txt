Washington's Farewell Address

Marking George Washington's 200th Birth Anniversary, the New York Public Library announced that to celebrate this memorable year, it will publish a reproduction of the original manuscript of the famous farewell address given to the American People when Washington last resigned the presidency and returned to rural life at Mount Vernon (마운트·싸논).

This original manuscript is one of the most valuable historical documents housed in the said Library, and accordingly, it was displayed at the President Washington Document Exhibition held in the main hall at 47th Street, 5th Avenue, New York City, to commemorate his 200th birthday.

The publication date for the reproduction has not yet been decided, but preparations are well underway with the intention to issue it within this year. <75>

**Summary**

This article reports that the New York Public Library plans to publish a replica of George Washington's Farewell Address manuscript in celebration of his 200th birth anniversary in 1932. The original, a highly valued document held by the library, was recently exhibited in New York City. Publication of the replica is expected later in the year. For historians, this piece shows how international news, particularly concerning significant historical figures and events in the United States like Washington's bicentennial, was reported in colonial Korea. It reflects an awareness of American history and democratic ideals, which might have resonated with Korean readers under Japanese rule.
