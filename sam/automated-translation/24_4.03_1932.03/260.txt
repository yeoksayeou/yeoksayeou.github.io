Reason for Leaving

Madam (To the newly hired, beautiful maid): So, why did you leave your previous house?
Maid (As if difficult to say): Well... The master of the house kissed me.
Madam: You left because of that! Oh my! What a virtuous lady you are.
Maid: Well... It was fine with me, but the Madam of that house said she was displeased and sent me away—<63>

**Summary**

This short piece presents a humorous dialogue between a madam and her newly hired maid. The maid reveals she left her previous job because the master kissed her. The madam initially praises her perceived virtue for leaving, but the maid clarifies that she didn't mind the kiss; it was the *previous* madam who was upset and fired her. From a historical perspective, this anecdote offers a glimpse into employer-employee dynamics within households, prevailing social mores regarding intimacy and class, and gender relations in 1930s colonial Korea. It subtly highlights the power imbalance and the differing perspectives between the employer (madam) and the employee (maid), particularly concerning the actions of the male head of household.
