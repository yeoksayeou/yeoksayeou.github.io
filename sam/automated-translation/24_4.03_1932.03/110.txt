笑話 (Joke/Humorous Story)

At a certain moving picture theater (활동사진관), while the film was screening, a young man groped in the darkness and barely managed to sit down in a chair. Not long after, a beautiful young lady sitting next to the young man gently put her arm around his waist and casually rested her head on his shoulder. The young man, also unexpectedly, put his arm around the young lady's waist. Then, less than a minute later, someone suddenly tapped the young man sharply on the shoulder; it was the young lady's lover, who had returned from the restroom.<35>

**Summary**

This short anecdote recounts a humorous incident in a dark movie theater where a young man and a young woman mistakenly embrace, only to be interrupted by the woman's actual lover returning from the restroom. From a historical perspective, the piece offers a glimpse into urban leisure activities like cinema-going in 1930s Korea and reflects contemporary social interactions and humor, possibly highlighting changing norms around dating or public displays of affection, albeit in a comedic, mistaken context. The use of older Korean spellings is also notable for linguistic study.
