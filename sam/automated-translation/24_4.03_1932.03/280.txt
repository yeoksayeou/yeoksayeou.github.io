金笠 詩
						李應洙
The author had previously thought that the best way (捿經) to learn the detailed biographical facts about Kim Sakkat (金笠) would be to go to the Kyŏngsŏng area and investigate the family register (족보) of the Andong Kim (安洞 金) clan. Then, upon seeing the author's article in last month's issue of "Samch'ŏlli" (三千里), a Mr. Kim Honghan (金洪漢), who identified himself as the direct great-grandson of Teacher Kim Sakkat, sent a letter to the author, promising much assistance in the future. This was truly unexpected and shed a great ray of light (光鋩) on the study of Kim Sakkat. Indeed, had I known that Teacher Kim Sakkat's great-grandson was alive, I would have sought him out already.
Regarding Mr. Kim Honghan, the author has only received a short letter, so detailed facts will be introduced after meeting him in the future. Now, for the second installment, I introduce several more poems. Adding the general meaning (大意) to each poem below is preparation for publishing a standalone volume in the future, and also because there might be readers with insufficient knowledge of classical Chinese. To widely disseminate these to them, it seemed good to add explanatory notes to convey the meaning at least somewhat. The author's knowledge of classical Chinese is also shallow (淺薄), so there may well be errors.

Anbyŏn Haksŏng 風景 20韻 (Anbyŏn Haksŏng Scenery, 20 Rhymes)
1. 勝槪江山何處是 Where are these scenic rivers and mountains?
2. 三台勢氣拱天壯<64> North of Ch'ŏrwŏn (鐵嶺) lies Anbyŏn (安邊), Ten thousand households veiled in smoke cling closely to the ground (萬戶籠煙撲地連). The imposing force of the Three Peaks (三台) arches grandly toward the sky.
3. 落落蒼松望十里 Sprawling green pines are visible for ten ri, 潺潺綠水帶南川 Murmuring green water embraces the Namch'ŏn stream. 4. 鶴樓聳翠雲中出 The soaring green of Haksŏng Pavilion (鶴樓) emerges amidst the clouds, 龍閣流丹水底懸 The flowing reds of the Dragon Pavilion (龍閣) are reflected suspended in the water's depths.
5. 一點南山當戶轉 A single point, Namsan (南山), stands clearly before the door, 千家美峴起煩煙 In Mihyŏlli's (美峴) thousand homes, the evening smoke rises thick.
6. 層蠻疊疊壯南北 Layered peaks upon peaks run majestically north and south, 大野茫茫分後前 A vast, boundless plain lies divided before and behind.
7. 咫尺造化天作府 Creation close at hand, a mansion made by heaven, 萬千勝壯地花餞 Myriad scenic splendors, an earthly floral farewell feast (地花餞). 8. 朝輝廣德瑞雲起 Morning brilliance shines on Kwangdŏk (廣德) as auspicious clouds rise, 夕影北山烽火燃 Evening shadows fall on Puksan (North Mountain) where signal fires burn.
9. 行樂少年誇豪氣 Pleasure-seeking youths boast of their high spirits, 踏靑遊子滿城阡 Spring strollers fill the city paths. 10. 吟風弄月幽懷足 Reciting poems in the wind, playing with the moon, quiet sentiments are fulfilled, 論古評今逸興遄 Discussing the past, critiquing the present, leisurely excitement quickens.
11. 莫笑鄙人淺陋意 Do not laugh at this humble person's shallow thoughts, 世間萬事水潺湲 All worldly affairs are like flowing water (潺湲). 12. 靑囊我拾山河景 Into this blue pouch (靑囊), I gather the scenery of mountains and rivers, 盡可應之亦可宣 All can be responded to, and also proclaimed.
13. 逸少情遊虛地去 Wang Xizhi's (逸少) sentimental journeys are gone to empty places, 靑蓮風月己而焉 Li Bai's (靑蓮) wind and moon have already passed. 14. 書釣豈塵世老 Will my books and fishing hook grow old in this dusty world? 攀龍他日果靑年 Climbing the dragon gate another day, I will indeed be a vigorous youth.
15. 芳蘭舍露氣初馥 Fragrant orchids by the pavilion hold the dew, their scent newly rich, 城柳帶黃顔色鮮 Castle willows tinged with yellow, faces [beneath them] appear vivid. 16. 院中物色靑春意 The sights within the courtyard hold the feeling of green spring, 門外客疎白鶴眠 Outside the gate, visitors are few, a white crane sleeps.
17. 梅裡凝光侵酒盞 Plum blossom dew's condensed light invades the wine cup, 竹窓和露襲硯田 Bamboo window's harmonious dew moistens the inkstone field. 18. 歸鴻北海三陽逐 Returning geese chase the three yangs (三陽 - spring) toward the North Sea, 白鷺春汀一足拳 A white egret on the spring sandbar stands on one leg.
19. 水助豪情長不渴 Water aids bold feelings, never-endingly unquenched, 山洪詩料興難綠 Mountains supply poetic material, excitement hard to exhaust (?). 20. 鶴城風景如斯 具外餘翠不盡傳 Haksŏng's scenery is thus; the remaining green beauty cannot be fully conveyed.
Notes: Haksŏng Pavilion (鶴樓) - Anbyŏn's Kanghakru (降鶴樓), Namsan (南山) - Also in Anbyŏn, Mihyŏn (美峴) - Name of a village, Mihyŏlli, Kwangdŏk (廣德) - Also a place name. <65>

大意 (General Meaning)
Where is this scenic land of rivers and mountains? North of Ch'ŏrwŏn lies the scenic spot of Anbyŏn. The mountain force of the Three Peaks grandly arches toward the vast sky, and the evening smoke rising from ten thousand households continuously covers the land (撲다 means covered).
Sprawling green pines stretch visibly for 10 ri, and murmuring green water surrounds the Namdaech'ŏn stream. The soaring green color of Kanghakru Pavilion emerges beyond the clouds, and the red and blue paint (丹靑) of the Dragon Pavilion is reflected, suspended in the depths of the flowing water. A single point, Namsan, stands clearly (the character 轉 is used like the Japanese 「ウタ」, meaning clearly) before the door.
In the thousand-home farming village of Mihyŏlli, evening smoke is thick, and beyond it, layered peaks run north and south, between which lies a vast plain divided front and back. Creation close at hand is surely a heavenly village's (天村) creation, and the myriad scenic splendors are an earthly floral farewell feast (地花餞). Auspicious clouds rise over Kwangdŏk, bathed in morning brilliance, and signal fires flicker on the north mountain in the evening sun. In such a place of exquisite scenery, pleasure-seeking youths boast of their high spirits, and the footprints (踪跡) of spring strollers fill the city. Reciting poems in the wind and playing with the moon fulfills quiet sentiments, and discussing the past and critiquing the present stirs leisurely excitement.
Do not laugh at the shallow thoughts of this humble person (the author himself). All worldly affairs are like flowing water (潺湲). Gathering the scenery of mountains and rivers into this blue pouch (靑囊 - poetic heart), sometimes responding, sometimes proclaiming (expressing) it. Roaming sentimentally through empty places like this since youth, Li Bai's (靑蓮) wind and moon have already passed by. However, how could my books and sword <66> simply grow old along with the dusty world? On the day I knock on the gate of success, I will become a brave youth. By the pavilion, fragrant orchids hold the white dew, their fragrance rich (馥郁), and the castle willows are tinged with yellow, making the faces of those standing beneath them appear even more vivid. It is a scene within the courtyard, seemingly symbolic of green spring, but outside the pavilion gate, visitors are few, and a white crane dozes alone. The clear light nestled among the plum blossoms invades the wine cup, and dew harmonious with the bamboo window drips forlornly onto the inkstone. Looking down from the pavilion, far below, the shadows of returning geese heading for the North Sea chasing the three yangs (spring) fade among the white clouds, and on the spring sandbar, a white egret stands poised on one leg. Water aids bold feelings, long and unquenchable, and the mountains broaden the poetic material, so excitement knows no bounds (붓틀 곳을 몰라하노나 - doesn't know where to settle). Having encountered Haksŏng's scenery like this, need I bother to describe all the other remaining green beauty?

上樓枠 (Written Upon Ascending the Pavilion)
趙雲鄕 (Cho Unhyang)

1. 也知窮達不相謀 You should know (也知) that poverty and success do not conspire together, 思樂橋邊歲幾周 How many years have I wandered around Sarakkyo Bridge (思樂橋邊)? 2. 漢北文章今太守 The literary fame of Hanbuk (漢北) reaches even the esteemed ears of the current Magistrate (太守), 滿西物望舊荊州 And he who enjoyed renown throughout Hoso (湖西) was once relegated to Kyŏngju (荊州) in the old days.
3. 酒誠狂藥常爲病 Wine, truly a maddening drug, is my constant illness, 詩亦風流可與酬 Poetry, too, is elegant and worthy of exchange. 4. 野笠編嫌登政閣 This rustic hat avoids the ambition of ascending to the government pavilion, 抱琴獨倚海山秋 Alone, embracing my kŏmun'go, I lean against the autumn of sea and mountains.
Note: 也知 - means 'you should rightly know', 也 is an auxiliary particle, an imperative auxiliary particle. 倅 - County Magistrate/Governor. 樓 - Also Haksŏng Pavilion (守邊 - guarding the border?).
大意 (General Meaning)
Magistrate Cho (趙太守)! Please know that I am one who has transcended <67> poverty and success in this world. Thus, I don't know how many years I have wandered around Sarakkyo Bridge. Look! The famous literature of Hanbuk has reached even the Magistrate's humble ears, and was not the man renowned in the land of Hoso once relegated to Kyŏngju in the old days? Thus, poverty and success seem to be things of constant change. Therefore, hiding my boredom with the maddening drug of wine is my constant illness. Poetry, along with wine, is also stimulating. This rustic hat of mine so dislikes the ambition of ascending to the government pavilion that I remain alone, embracing my kŏmun'go, leaning against the autumn of the sea and mountains.

缸 (항아리 - Jar; here: Chamber Pot)
1. 闔闢常煩達夜燈 Opening and closing constantly bothers the lamp lit through the night, 醉餘之客病中僧 The lingering drunkard and the monk amidst illness. 2. 團圓影轉銅山局 The round shadow turns within the copper mountain's vessel, 酒落聲懸雪瀑繩 The sound of falling liquid hangs like a rope of snow-white waterfall.
3. 少量堪客河飮鼠 A small amount makes it difficult for the river-drinking rat to enter, 潔光頗忌量痕蠅 Its clean gleam rather detests the fly that leaves its dung marks (壘痕). 4. 蹇裳挾坐佳人態 The posture of a beauty, tucking up her skirt and squatting, 恰似深林博免鷹 Is just like an eagle in the deep forest seizing a rabbit.
大意 (General Meaning)
The chamber pot (溺缸) finds it constantly bothersome (번고로이) that drunken guests who urinate frequently and monks amidst illness get up in the middle of the night (夜半), light a lamp, and frequently close and open it. Inside the chamber pot, each time the amount of urine increases, the trace of the round water level's shadow rolls up inside the copper vessel (銅器 - yogang). When someone comes to urinate, along with the sound of falling liquid (酒落한 음성), it hangs a rope-shaped (繩形), snow-white waterfall. When the amount of urine is small, it is difficult for a river rat (河鼠) to enter, yet despite this, its gleaming outer copper surface (潔光) greatly dislikes flies landing and leaving their dung marks (壘痕의 찌). <68> And the posture (자태) of a beautiful woman (佳人) tucking up her skirt (치마를 것고) and squatting (쭝구리고 안즌) over this chamber pot is exactly like (흡사하다) an eagle (매) seizing (차고 안젓는) a rabbit (토기) in the deep forest (深林).

山村學長 (Village Schoolmaster)
1. 山村學長太多威 The village schoolmaster has too much dignity, 高着塵冠鍾唾桃 Wearing high his dusty cap, constantly spitting phlegm (鍾唾). 2. 大讀天皇高弟子 Loudly reading "Tianhuang" (天皇) is his best student, 尊稱風憲奴明儔 Address him respectfully as "P'unghŏn" (風憲), and he beams as if a good friend has come.
3. 每逢丌字憑衰眠 Whenever encountering an unknown character (丌字/兀字), he blames his failing eyes (衰眼), 輒到巡杯籍自鬚 When the cups circulate (巡杯), he uses his white beard (白鬚) as pretext [for the first cup]. 4. 一般空堂生色語 In this empty hall, he boasts saying, 今年過客盡楊州 "This year, the travelers visiting me were all from Sŏul (楊州)!"
Note: 鍾唾 - Kim Sakkat's way of expressing "phlegm" (가래춤).

大意 (General Meaning)
The village schoolmaster has great dignity, sitting there wearing his dusty cap high and frequently spitting phlegm (가래춤을 탁탁 배앗고 안젓다). However, his highest student is actually the one loudly reading the first volume of the *Saryak* (史略初卷), "Tianhuang-ssi, Dihuang-ssi" (天皇씨 地皇씨). If someone addresses him respectfully as "P'unghŏn" (village elder/official), his face lights up (희색이 만면) as if a good friend has arrived. When discussing texts, whenever he encounters a character he doesn't know (兀은 몰을 올字 - 'ol' means not knowing), he blames (憑籍하다가) his failing eyes (衰眼). When it's time to share drinks (술을 난우게 될 때에는), he uses his white beard (白鬚), signifying old age (老齡), as a pretext (憑籍하고) to receive the first cup (巡杯는 첫잔을 밧것다는 패물이다 - receiving the first cup is the prize?).
And sitting in this empty grass-thatched hall (텅빈 초당), he boasts quite proudly (아조 생색을 내 말하되), "This year, the travelers (過客) who sought out my house were all Sŏul travelers (서울나그내). You see, I'm quite somebody too." Meeting even one traveler from Sŏul (서울 過客) is a great source of pride (대자만이다).

寡婦 (Widow) <69>

1. 失將壇前似獨事 Before the altar of her lost husband, sitting alone, 啾啾痛怨日相聞 Day after day, mournful resentment is heard. 2. 沓盟百世餘丹嘴 The hundred-year vow still remains on her red lips (丹嘴), 守節三年著素裙 While observing mourning for three years, she wears a white skirt (素裙).
3. 幽愁爲欲江山老 Her hidden sorrow desires only to grow old with the rivers and mountains, 別恨常如草大焚 The resentment from parting remains as fervent as burning grass. 4. 碧瓦紅籠來去意 The intent of coming and going with red lanterns among blue tiles, 爽墟何處訪新墳 Is to visit the fresh grave mound in the graveyard (爽墟)?
大意 (General Meaning)
The plight of a widow, sitting alone before the altar (제단압헤) of her deceased husband (亡夫), mourning grievously (啾啾히 痛怨하는) every day. The words of the hundred-year vow are still held on her red lips (붉은 임술에 담어잇는대), but in no time, she has come to wear the white mourning skirt (素裙) of three years' fidelity (3년 수절).
Her hidden sorrow (幽愁) is solely the thought of wanting to grow old along with the rivers and mountains (강산과 함게 늙고자 하는 생각뿐이며); the resentment (원한) from the time of parting in death (사별하든 때) is still as fervent (열렬하여) as if burning grass and trees (초목을 태우는 듯). The meaning of coming and going (去來하는 뜻) among the blue-tiled roofs (碧瓦 사이로) carrying a red lantern (紅籠을 타고) is to go to the refreshing mound graveyard (爽墟의 묘지에 가서) to seek the grave mound (묘분을 찻즈랴함이로다).

喪配自輓 (Self-Lament on Losing a Spouse)
1. 遇何晩也別何催 Why was our meeting so late, why was our parting so hurried? 未卜其欣只卜哀 Before knowing its joy, only sorrow arrived. 2. 祭酒惟餘*日釀 For the ritual wine, only that brewed for the wedding day* remains, 襲衣仍用嫁時裁 The burial shroud (襲衣) is still the clothing tailored for the wedding.
3. 窓前舊種少桃發 Before the window, the previously planted young peach tree blooms, 簾外新巢双燕來 Outside the screen, swallows come in pairs to their new nest. 4. 賢否卽從妻母問 Ask the wife's mother whether she was worthy or not, 其言吾女德兼才 Her words: "My daughter possessed both virtue and talent."
大意 (General Meaning)
This is a husband's poem mourning his wife who died less than a few months after being brought home.
Why was our meeting (상봉함) so late (느젓스며), and why did parting (사별) arrive (催促하엿느냐) so quickly? Before seeing its joy (其歡樂), sorrow (哀傷) arrived first. The ritual wine (祭酒) used is the same wine used at the wedding (婚時에 쓰든 술), and the burial clothes (死衣) worn are the garments from the wedding day (嫁時의 의복). (To be continued in the next issue) <70>
<64-70>

**Summary**

This article by Yi Ŭngsu is the second installment presenting poems by the wandering poet Kim Sakkat (金笠). Yi expresses excitement about being contacted by Kim Sakkat's great-grandson, Kim Honghan, anticipating further insights into the poet's life. He then presents several poems attributed to Kim Sakkat, each accompanied by Yi's own interpretation (大意) aimed at aiding reader comprehension. The poems cover diverse themes: the scenic beauty of Anbyŏn (安邊), reflections on status and integrity when interacting with an official, a humorous and earthy depiction of a chamber pot, a satirical sketch of an ignorant village schoolmaster, the sorrow of a widow, and a husband's lament for his recently deceased wife.

From a colonial history perspective, the article is interesting as it shows continued interest in and preservation of traditional Korean literary figures like Kim Sakkat during the Japanese colonial period (1932). Yi Ŭngsu's effort to translate and explain classical Chinese poems for a broader audience, including those with "insufficient knowledge of classical Chinese," reflects cultural activities aimed at maintaining Korean heritage. The mention of Kim Sakkat's descendant suggests the persistence of lineage and historical memory. The content of the poems themselves, focusing on Korean landscapes, social interactions, and personal emotions, offers glimpses into pre-colonial life and sentiments, potentially serving as a subtle cultural anchor amidst colonial rule. Historians might find the act of publishing and interpreting such poetry in a popular magazine like *Samch'ŏlli* significant for understanding cultural production and identity maintenance during this era.

大意
勝江山이 이 어데인고 鐵原이북에 安邊이란 勝地가 잇더라. 三臺의 산세가 웅장하게 창공에 拱衝하엿고 萬戶에서 이는 暮煙이 連綿히 대지를 덥헛다.(첫(撲)다함은 덥헛다는 意)
落落한 蒼松이 10리로 바라보게 連하여 잇고 잔잔한 綠水가 南大川을 둘러잇는대 降鶴樓의聳出한 翠色이 雲外에 벗어낫고 龍閣의 丹靑이 유수의 底面에 倒懸하다. 一點 南山이 戶前에 뚜렷하고 (轉字는 日語로 「ウタ」라하야 뚜렷하다는 意)
美峴里의 千家 농촌에 暮煙야 자욱하며 그박게 層岳이 첩첩하게 남북으로 달린 사이여 망망한 大野가 전후를 난우어 누엇잇더라. 지척의 조화가 족히 天村의 창조이고 천만의 勝狀이 地花餞이로다. 朝輝 빗친 廣德에 瑞雲이 일고 석양의 북산에 봉화가 명멸한다. 이러한 絶勝地이매 행락소년이 호기를 과장하고 踏靑遊子의 踪跡이 성중에 가둑이 차서 吟風弄月에 幽懷가 裕足하고 論古評今에 逸興이 헐석거리는 정도이다.
鄙人(작노자신)들의 淺陋한 뜻을 웃지 말라. 세간만사가 다 潺湲한 유수 갓너니라. 이 靑囊(詩心)에 산하의 경치를 수습하여 노코 때로는 응대하고 때로는 宣明(표현)하는 것이니 少時로붓터 이갓치 虛地를 情遊하며 悠去하여 단이는 이에 靑蓮風月은 벌서 다 지나가버렷다. 그러나 나의 書劍이엇지＜66＞ 塵世와 함께 그저 前고 말 것이리. 등용문을 두다리는 他日에는 果勇한 청년이 되리로다. 樓邊의 芳蘭에 白露가 먹음어 향기가 馥郁하고 城柳가 황색을 띄어 그 아래의 佇立하여 잇는 사람들의 안색이 더욱 선명하게 어리여 보이노나. 院中의 物色이다. 청춘의 상징인 듯 한 대 樓門外에는 문객이 희소하야 白鶴이 홀로 조을고 잇다. 매화 꼿속에 업킨 淸光이 酒盞에 침범하고 죽창에 和露가 硯石우에 처량히 뚝뚝 떠러지는대 樓上에서 멀리 眼下를 俯瞰하니 三陽을 쫏차 북해로 가는 歸鴻의 影子가 백운간에 음멸하고 春汀에 백로가 외짝다리를 까부리고 서잇도다. 물은 豪情을 도아 길어 盡할 줄을 몰으고 산은 詩料를 넓혀주어 흥이 붓틀 곳을 몰라하노나. 鶴城의 풍경을 이갓치 접하여 보앗스니 기타의 餘翠는 굿해여 說盡치 야흐랴노라.

趙太守여! 나는 이 세상에서 窮達을＜67＞ 초월한 사람임을 알어주오. 이러하야 思樂橋邊을 멧 해나 두고 배회하엿는지 몰으오. 보시요. 漢北의 명문장이 太守의 賤聰에도 내려가고 또 湖西땅에 명망을 날리는 사람도 녯날에는 사람도 녜날에는 荊州에 좌선되엿든 사람이 안이오. 이갓치 궁달이란 有爲轉變한 것이구려. 이리해서 나는 狂藥인 술로 무료를 匿함이 항상 병이오. 詩 또한 술과 함께 흥을 돗울만 하외다. 내 이 野笠은 政閣에 올 요기를 그럿케도 嫌避하야 홀로 거문고를 안고 海山의 가을에 의지하고 잇소이다.

缸(요강便器)
1. 闔闢常煩達夜燈 醉餘之客病中僧 2. 團圓影轉銅山局 酒落聲懸雪瀑繩
3. 少量堪客河飮鼠 潔光頗忌量痕蠅 4. 蹇裳挾坐佳人態 恰似深林博免鷹
大意
溺缸이란 자는 특별히 소변을 자조 보는 취객과 병중의 僧이 夜半에 일어나 등화를 켜가지고 자기를 빈번이 다덧다, 열엇다 함은 항상 번고로이 생각한다. 溺缸 속에서는 소변의 양이 뿔을 때마다 원형의 수평선의 影跡이 銅器(요강) 속을 구을러 올라가고 사람이 와서 소변을 볼 시에는 酒落한 음성과 함께 白雪갓흔 폭포를 繩形으로 걸어 논는다. 소변량이 적을 때에는 河鼠가 들어가기가 곤란인대 그 주제에 외면의 반뜩반뜩 빗나는 구리의 潔光은 파리가 안저 壘痕의 찌를 ＜68＞ 싸노음을 대단이 실혀 한다. 그리고 佳人이 치마를 것고 이 요강에 쭝구리고 안즌 자태는 맛치 深林에서「매」가 「토기」를 차고 안젓는 형상에 흡사하다.

山村學長
1. 山村學長太多威 高着塵冠鍾唾桃 2. 大讀天皇高弟子 尊稱風憲奴明儔
3. 每逢丌字憑衰眠 輒到巡杯籍自鬚  4. 一般空堂生色語 今年過客盡楊州
註 鍾唾-「가래춤」이란 말을 金笠式으로 표현한 말.

大意
산촌의 학장님 대단이 위엄이 만허서 塵冠을 놉히 쓰고 가래춤을 탁탁 배앗고 안젓다. 그러나 실은 天皇씨 地皇씨하고 史略初卷을 고성으로 읽는 제자가 제일 놉흔 제자인대 누가 가서 풍헌이라고 존칭하여 주면 조흔 친구가 왓다고 희색이 만면일다. 글을 토론타가 매양 몰을 글자(兀은 몰을 올字)를 맛나면 衰眼에다 憑籍하다가 술을 난우게 될 때에는 白鬚이 老齡이다 憑籍하고 巡杯는 첫잔을 밧것다는 패물이다.
그리고 이 텅빈 초당에 안저서 아조 생색을 내 말하되「금년에 내 집을 차저온 過客은 그래도 다-서울나그내야. 나도 괜찬은 사람이거든.」하고 서울 過客을 한돌 맛난 것이 대자만이다.

寡婦＜69＞

1. 失將壇前似獨事 啾啾痛怨日相聞 2. 沓盟百世餘丹嘴 守節三年著素裙
3. 幽愁爲欲江山老 別恨常如草大焚 4. 碧瓦紅籠來去意 爽墟何處訪新墳
大意
亡夫의 제단압헤 홀로 안저 매일 啾啾히 痛怨하는 과부의 신세. 백년을 맹서튼 말이 아직 붉은 임술에 담어잇는대 어느 사이에 3년 수절의 素裙을 입게 되엿다.
幽愁는 과부로 강산과 함게 늙고자 하는 생각뿐이며 사별하든 때의 원한은 초목을 태우는 듯 아즉도 열렬하여 碧瓦 사이로 紅籠을 타고 去來하는 뜻은 爽墟의 묘지에 가서 묘분을 찻즈랴함이로다.

喪配自輓
1. 遇何晩也別何催 未卜其欣只卜哀 2. 祭酒惟餘*日釀 襲衣仍用嫁時裁
3. 窓前舊種少桃發 簾外新巢双燕來 4. 賢否卽從妻母問 其言吾女德兼才
大意
데려온 지 수월이 못되여 죽은 안해를 吊하는 남편의 시다.
상봉함은 엇지 그리 느젓스며 사별은 엇지 이리도 빨리 催促하엿느냐, 其歡樂을 보기 전에 哀傷이 먼저 닥처오고 말엇고나. 祭酒는 婚時에 쓰든 술을 그대로 쓰고 死衣는 嫁時의 의복을 입헛다.(이하 次號續)＜70＞
