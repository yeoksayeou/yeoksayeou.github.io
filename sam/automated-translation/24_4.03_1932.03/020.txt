Company Notice
						Editorial Bureau

Through a Samch'ŏlli general meeting, we intended to thoroughly inform [readers] in this month's issue about the "Current State of Nationalist Movement Forces and Social Movement Forces," but due to objective circumstances (객관적 사정), this was insufficient. We will discuss this again at a later date.<7>

**Summary**

The Editorial Bureau of Samch'ŏlli magazine informs readers that a planned article detailing the "Current State of Nationalist Movement Forces and Social Movement Forces" could not be sufficiently covered in the current issue due to "objective circumstances." They state their intention to revisit the topic in the future. This brief notice is significant for historians studying colonial Korea as the phrase "objective circumstances" often served as a euphemism for censorship or external pressure from Japanese authorities, highlighting the limitations faced by the Korean press when attempting to discuss politically sensitive topics like nationalist and socialist movements.
