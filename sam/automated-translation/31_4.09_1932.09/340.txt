**Body Text Translation:**
O The Mid-Autumn Festival (仲秋佳節), when one thinks of Oksong Pavilion (玉銅소) on a moonlit night (月明夜), has arrived. How do all of you intend to enjoy this autumn season?

O As per the company announcement (社告), our company will be newly publishing a Women's Magazine (婦人雜誌) starting this coming October. Please read it avidly.

O All booklets from the publishing department are also going on sale from the beginning of September, so we hope for many orders.<100>

**Summary**

This editor's postscript from the September 1932 issue of Samch'ŏlli magazine welcomes the autumn season (Ch'usŏk) and announces two business developments: the upcoming launch of a new women's magazine in October and the sale of books from the company's publishing department starting in September. Historians might find this interesting as it reflects the commercial activities and expansion strategies of a Korean publishing house during the colonial period, including attempts to diversify its offerings by targeting a female readership and promoting its other publications. The text also provides examples of Korean language usage and orthography from the 1930s.
