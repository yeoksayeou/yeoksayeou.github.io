**Summary**

This short notice is an advertisement from the Samch'ŏlli Business Bureau seeking individuals interested in becoming regional distributors (branch offices) for its magazines, "Samch'ŏlli" and "Man'guk Puin." It instructs potential distributors to request the company's regulations for branch offices. For historians, this piece offers a small window into the business operations and distribution strategies of Korean publishing houses during the colonial period, indicating an effort to expand readership beyond the capital into regional areas. It reflects the commercial side of cultural production under Japanese rule.
