Article Title: 秋風辭 (Song of the Autumn Wind)
Author: 漢武帝
Article Type: 시 (Poem)

Autumn wind rises, white clouds fly,
Plants and trees yellow and fall, wild geese return south.

Orchids have splendor, chrysanthemums have fragrance,
I long for the beautiful one, unable to forget.

Floating a storied boat, crossing the Fen River,
Traversing the midstream, raising white waves.

Flutes and drums sound, oarsmen's song begins,
Sighing that utmost joy leads to much sorrow.

How long does youth last? What can be done about old age?<1>

**Summary**

This article presents the classical Chinese poem "Song of the Autumn Wind" attributed to Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. The poem evokes feelings of melancholy brought on by autumn, describes a grand river journey, expresses longing for a loved one, and reflects on the fleeting nature of youth, joy, and life itself. For historians studying colonial Korea, the publication of such a canonical piece of classical Chinese literature in a popular Korean magazine like *Samch'ŏlli* in 1932 is noteworthy. It indicates the continued cultural relevance of the Chinese classics during a period of Japanese rule, potentially serving as apolitical content, a reflection of shared East Asian heritage distinct from Japanese modernity, or perhaps even a subtle expression of longing and the passage of time resonant with the era's mood.
