**Body Text Translation:**
An Apple
						Kwak Chongsu

As I offer one apple (林檎),
Please know it is given with sincerity,
And eat it, skin and all.

Even as you eat the skin (껍질낭),
Please be sure to discard the seed.
It shall become a seed of love.<92>

**Summary**

This short poem by Kwak Chongsu uses the simple act of gifting an apple as a metaphor. The speaker asks the recipient to accept the gift wholeheartedly ("eat it, skin and all") but to preserve the seed, suggesting it represents the potential for future love or connection. For historians, the poem offers a glimpse into personal sentiment and lyrical expression during the colonial period, potentially contrasting with more overtly political or nationalist themes often studied from this era. Its use of traditional Korean poetic sensibility and slightly archaic language (like honorific imperatives ending in -소서) within a modernizing context is also noteworthy.
