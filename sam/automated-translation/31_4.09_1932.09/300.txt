**Body Text Translation:**
A Letter Came from My Beloved
						Kwak Chong-su

Saying you cry day and night,
A letter came from my beloved.

Even if my beloved’s heart were at ease,
This body would go to see you,
But hearing you cry, longing for me,
This heart of mine feels as if it has sinned.

A thousand, ten thousand times,
I wish I could see you, beloved, but
Even if I visit my crying beloved,
With what could I possibly console you?
If I were to enter my beloved’s house,
You would greet me gladly with stockinged feet, but
What can I do with an empty pocket,
And nothing but an aching heart?

Beloved, you long for me,
Crying day and night, but
Unable to visit my crying beloved,
My heart can only ache.

Receiving your letter and being unable to come,
Will you not say I am heartless (無情)?
Being heartless is money’s fault;
Who can know this aching heart?

Saying you cry day and night,
A letter came from my beloved.<92>
<91-92>

**Summary**

This poem by Kwak Chong-su expresses the sorrow and helplessness of a speaker who receives a letter from their beloved, learning they are crying constantly out of longing. The speaker desperately wants to visit but feels unable to do so because of poverty ("empty pocket"). They lament their inability to console their beloved or offer anything tangible, feeling trapped by their financial circumstances, which they describe as the reason for their apparent heartlessness. For historians, the poem offers a poignant glimpse into the personal struggles possibly exacerbated by the economic conditions of colonial Korea in the 1930s. It highlights themes of separation, longing, and the deep impact of poverty on personal relationships and emotional well-being during that era.

						郭鍾守
밤낫으로 우-신다고
님의게서 편지왓소

님의 심사 편하신들
이 몸 가서 뵈올 것을
날 그리워 우-신다니
이 내 마음 죄지은듯

님이야 천만번도
뵈옵고 십건만은
우-시는 님 저저간들
무엇으로 달레릿가
님의 집에 들어서면
보선발노 반기련만
어이하리 뷘 주머니
썩는 가슴뿐인 것을

님이야 날 그리워
밤낫으로 우-시건만
우-시는 님 못가뵈는
내 가슴은 썩을 밧게

편지 밧고 못가오니
無情타 안하시리
無情도 돈 탓이라
썩는 가슴 뉘 알니까

밤낫으로 우-신다고
님의게서 편지 왓소<92>
