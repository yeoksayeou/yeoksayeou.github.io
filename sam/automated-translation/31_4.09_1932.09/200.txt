Clear Autumn Poetry Recital

Red Cliff Rhapsody

So Cha-cham (蘇子瞻)

In the autumn of the year Im-sul (壬戌), on the day after the full moon of the seventh month, Master So and his guests went boating beneath the Red Cliff. A clear wind blew gently, and the water's surface remained calm. Raising his wine cup, he toasted his guests, reciting the "Poem of the Bright Moon" and singing the "Chapter of the Modest Maiden." Shortly, the moon rose above the eastern mountains, lingering between the constellations Dipper and Ox. White dew lay across the river, and the water's light met the sky. Letting the single reed boat drift wherever it pleased, it felt like crossing ten thousand *kyŏng* of vast emptiness. Vast and boundless, it was like riding the void, commanding the wind, not knowing where it would stop. Light and airy, it was like leaving the world behind, standing alone, sprouting wings, and ascending as an immortal.

On the Love of the Lotus

Chu Mu-suk (周茂叔)

Among the flowers of water and land, those worthy of love are numerous indeed. T'ao Yüan-ming (陶淵明) of Chin solely loved the chrysanthemum. Since the T'ang dynasty, people have greatly loved the peony. I alone love the lotus, which emerges from mud yet is unstained, bathed in clear ripples yet not seductive. Its inside is open, its outside straight; it does not sprawl, nor does it branch. Its fragrance spreads far and grows purer. It stands tall and pure, to be admired from afar, but not treated with familiarity. I say the chrysanthemum is the hermit among flowers; the peony, the wealthy and noble among flowers; the lotus, the gentleman among flowers. Alas! Regarding the love of chrysanthemums, after T'ao, few have been heard of. As for the love of the lotus, who shares this love with me? For the love of the peony, it is fitting that many admire it.<65>

Remarriage

So Min (蘇民)

The married life of a young man named Chŏn Mu (全無) and a woman named Chang Kyŏngae (張景愛) ended in ruin. Consequently, Chŏn Mu remarried a Japanese woman (日女) and entered her family as an adopted son-in-law (婿養子), while Chang Kyŏngae too will remarry before long.

Unable to forget the affection I held,
I sought the place where my love resided;
He too shed tears,
We met, indeed we met, but

He was already with a XX person,
In a love nest,
Whispering intimately,
He had even forgotten his own name.

The butterfly mad for the flower
Sees even fire as a flower,
How could it not know
It enters the flames?

I, thinking pitifully
Of his future,
From the site of old dreams,
Was awakened from illusion (幻滅).

Those incarnations of demons,
I fear seeing them even in dreams;
Letting the past flow away in the water,
I intend to make only new promises for the future. (End)<66>

**Summary**

This article presents two classical Chinese prose pieces, Su Shi's "Red Cliff Rhapsody" describing a transcendent boating trip and Zhou Dunyi's "On the Love of the Lotus" extolling the lotus flower as a symbol of the gentleman, followed by a modern Korean poem by So Min titled "Remarriage." The poem narrates the painful aftermath of a failed marriage, where the male ex-partner remarries a Japanese woman and becomes an adopted son-in-law, while the female narrator grapples with disillusionment and resolves to look towards the future. For historians, the juxtaposition of revered Chinese classics with a contemporary Korean poem addressing modern social issues like divorce, remarriage, and even intermarriage (Korean man marrying a Japanese woman and being adopted into her family – 婿養子) under colonial rule is highly revealing. It reflects the complex cultural landscape, blending traditional values with the emerging realities and social transformations of colonial Korean society. The explicit mention of remarriage to a "日女" (Japanese woman) is particularly noteworthy in the context of Japanese colonial influence.

淸秋詩吟
赤壁賦

蘇子瞻

壬戌之秋 七月旣望 蘇子與客
泛舟遊於 赤壁之下 淸風徐來
水波不興 擧酒屬客 誦明月之詩歌
窈窕之章 少焉月出 於東山之上
徘徊於斗牛之間 白露橫江 水光接天
縱一葦之所 如凌萬頃之 茫然浩浩乎
如憑虛御風而 不知其所止 飄飄乎
如遺世獨立 羽化而 登仙.

愛蓮設

周茂叔

水陸草木之花 可愛者甚蕃
晋陶淵明 獨愛菊 自李唐來
世人 甚愛牧丹 予獨愛蓮之出於
泥而不染濯淸漣而不妖 中通外直
不蔓不技 香遠益淸 亭亭淨植可
遠觀而不可 褻翫焉 予謂菊花之隱
逸者也 牡丹花之富貴者也 蓮花之
君子者也 噫菊之愛陶 後鮮有聞
蓮之愛 同予者何人 牡丹之愛 宜乎衆矣<65>

再婚

蘇民

全無라는 청년과 張景愛라는 여자의 결혼생활은 파탄이 되엿다. 그리하야 全無는 日女와 재혼하야 婿養子로 드러가고 張景愛 역시 未久에 재혼을 할 것이다.

든 情이 나지를 못하야
님이 잇는 곳 차젓드니
그도 역시 눈물지으며
만나기는 만낫건만

그는 벌서 XX人과
사랑의 보금자리에서
속살거리노라고
자긔의 姓名까지 이젓네

꼿에 밋친 나븨는
불도 꼿으로 보고
제몸이 불속에 드러가는 줄
어이 그리 모르난고

나는 그의 압날을
可惜히도 생각하면서
녯날의 꿈터로붓터
幻滅을 깻치엇다

惡魔의 化身인 그들
꿈에 볼가 두려하며
과거는 물에 흘려보내고
미래만 새 약속을 지으려한다. (끗)<66>
