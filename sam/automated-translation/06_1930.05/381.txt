紀念號 發行豫告 (Announcement of Commemorative Issue Publication)

The upcoming June issue will be a special enlarged commemorative issue (at the standard price) for our first anniversary, and we will publish it on schedule, splendidly decorated so as not to disappoint your expectations. We hope you will place many orders.

社告 (Company Announcement)

Our company's external sales representative, Mr. Kim Ilhŏn (金日憲), has been specially dispatched to Hamgyŏng North and South provinces. We ask the local personages to show him much favor.

**Summary**

This article consists of two short announcements from the Samch'ŏlli magazine publisher. The first promotes the upcoming June issue as a special enlarged first-anniversary edition, promising high quality and requesting advance orders. The second introduces a sales representative, Kim Ilhŏn, dispatched to the Hamgyŏng provinces (North and South) and asks for local support. From a historical perspective, these notices highlight the magazine's active promotion and efforts to expand its circulation network into regional areas like Hamgyŏng-do during the colonial period. The mention of a specific sales representative and targeted region reveals the business operations and market expansion strategies of Korean publishing houses at the time.
