○Words of Apology

Regarding the "Impressions of Newspaper Reporters" section, the article on Kim Ch'angsuk written by Mr. Sin Kyŏngsun had to be abbreviated due to unavoidable circumstances. We ask for your understanding. <62>

**Summary**

This brief editorial note apologizes to readers for having to shorten an article by Sin Kyŏngsun about Kim Ch'angsuk, which was part of a series on newspaper reporters' impressions. The reason given is "unavoidable circumstances." From a historical perspective, this vague explanation is significant. Kim Ch'angsuk was a well-known independence activist, and discussing such figures was highly sensitive under Japanese colonial rule. The "unavoidable circumstances" almost certainly refer to censorship or self-censorship pressures faced by the magazine, highlighting the constraints on expression and the risks associated with covering politically sensitive topics during that period.
