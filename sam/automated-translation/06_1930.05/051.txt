Ch'unwŏn's Autobiography

Mr. Yi Kwangsu (李光洙氏)'s autobiography, "Insaeng ŭi Hyanggi" (人生의 香氣 - The Scent of Life), is truly the tearful history of his struggles over the last twenty years, pouring his heart and soul into building Chosŏn (朝鮮)'s new literature and new thought. It is indeed a precious historical record that will become the "profile" of "Chosŏn." It was scheduled to begin serialization in this magazine starting this month's issue, but while writing, he suddenly fell ill and was unable to complete the manuscript. Therefore, we have unavoidably decided to publish it starting from next month's issue. Our company prays for Mr. Yi's speedy recovery from his illness and, at the same time, apologizes to our many readers for not being able to publish it in this month's issue.<17>

**Summary**

This editor's note from the May 1930 issue of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine announces the postponement of Yi Kwangsu (pen name Ch'unwŏn)'s autobiography, "Insaeng ŭi Hyanggi" (The Scent of Life). The serialization was delayed because Yi fell ill while writing. The editors praise the upcoming work as a significant record of Yi's twenty-year effort in shaping Korea's modern literature and thought, calling it a "profile of Chosŏn," and apologize to readers for the delay. From a historical perspective, the note highlights Yi Kwangsu's perceived importance as a central figure in colonial Korea's cultural and intellectual scene, framing his life story as intrinsically linked to the nation's development ("profile of Chosŏn"). The anticipation and the public apology for the delay underscore his prominence and the significance attached to new literary and intellectual movements during this period.
