How many times can one person die?

One summer, there were continually four or five women who committed suicide by jumping from the Han River Railway Bridge.

Angered, a policeman was standing guard when a certain young woman rushed up in panic and tried to throw herself into the river.

The policeman ran over, grabbed her, and said, "So it was you who's been dying every night lately. Aigoo, you wicked wench!"<26>

**Summary**

This short anecdote tells of a policeman guarding the Han River Railway Bridge, a frequent site of suicides by women. When he intercepts another young woman attempting to jump, he exasperatedly accuses her of being the same person who "dies every night," mistaking her for the previous victims. From a historical perspective, the piece, though presented as humor, reflects the social issue of suicide, particularly among women, at a specific location (Hangang Bridge) during the colonial period. It also potentially reveals the somewhat desensitized or frustrated attitude of the police towards these recurring tragedies.
