Impression of a Newspaper Reporter on Son Pyŏng-hŭi Standing in Court
						Yu Kwang-nyŏl

It was around 10 AM on a summer day in 1920. At the Temporary Supreme Court in Chŏng-dong (貞洞), the public trial of 48 individuals was continuing. As usual, I went in as a reporter for D Company to take notes, but on this day, none of the other defendants appeared in court. Because the ailing Son Pyŏng-hŭi was to appear, police security was even tighter both inside and outside the courthouse, and the number of guards inside the court (廷內) had increased; their faces were tense as if something might happen at any moment.

A car arrived, and Ŭiam Son Pyŏng-hŭi was brought out, still lying on a stretcher. At this moment, the previously calm pond water seemed to suddenly ripple as if wind had passed over it; guards rushed left and right (左奔右走), and after he was taken from the car, still lying on the stretcher, dozens of guards carried him into the courtroom. Once inside the court, the guards surrounded him closely, maintaining vigilance, and the spectator gallery also buzzed as if something unusual was occurring.

The presiding judge, with a most solemn demeanor, asked for his address and name as usual, but perhaps because of his illness, Son Ŭiam's voice was faint.

The judge, perhaps straining to hear the voice, looked around for a moment, glanced left and right, and then quietly gestured to the clerk with his eyes. The clerk silently descended from the judge's bench (法壇) to the defendant's stand (被告席). It was a rare sight for a court clerk to come down to the defendant's stand. Son Ŭiam, who had lost the freedom of his body due to hemiplegia (半身不遂), remained seated, supported by guards, his tiger-like eyes (虎目) wide open, staring straight ahead at the judge's bench. Perhaps he was recalling his eventful past (風雲), deeply moved by a certain sentiment...<34>

Judge: Defendant, is it true that you, as a member of the Tonghak Party (東學黨), being dissatisfied with the politics of the time during the Korean era around the 27th year of Meiji (1894), initiated the Tonghak Rebellion (東學亂)?

Son: That is so (그럿소).

(10 lines omitted here - original text)

Judge: When that disturbance failed due to the arrival of large Qing and Japanese armies (日淸大兵), did you go into exile with Ch'oe Si-hyŏng, who was sentenced to death in Taegu for the crime of insurrection (內亂罪)? When Ch'oe Si-hyŏng was captured, did you go to China seeking to ally with China's Li Hung-chang (李鴻章)?

Son: That is so.

Judge: Afterwards, did you go to Japan and conspire with Inukai Tsuyoshi (犬養毅), Toyama Mitsuru (頭山滿), and Pak Yŏng-hyo (朴泳孝), a Korean exile at the time, attempting to reform Korea's internal administration (朝鮮內政改革)?

Son: That is so.

...(Omitted - original text)...

Judge: In the 37th year of Meiji (1904), when the Russo-Japanese War broke out, did you have the Tonghak Party (東學黨) help Japan and donate military funds (軍費) to Japan?

Son: That is so.

Judge: After that, did you send Yi Yong-gu (李容九) to Korea to form an association called the Chinbohoe (進步會), which later became the Ilchinhoe (一進會)?
..(.Omitted - original text)...
...Omitted...
...formed the Taehan Hyŏphoe (大韓協會)...
...(Omitted - original text)...

Son: ...That is so.

Judge: ...After the Japan-Korea Annexation (日韓倂合)...Omitted(-original text)...Defendant...Omitted(-original text)...

Son's face seemed to flush briefly, then returned to its usual state.

Son: That is so.

Thus, the impression I received meeting him in the courtroom was, besides his greatness, nothing else.

After that, I have impressions from his time near death (臨終時) and from meeting him when I visited his secluded house (幽宅) in Uidong (牛耳洞) and elsewhere, but I will stop writing here. (Remainder omitted - original text)<35>

**Summary**

This article by reporter Yu Kwang-nyŏl recounts his experience observing the ailing Ch'ŏndogyo leader Son Pyŏng-hŭi during his trial in 1920 related to the March 1st Movement. Despite being carried in on a stretcher and weakened by illness, Son maintains a dignified presence. The judge questions him about his past, including his role in the 1894 Tonghak Peasant Revolution, exile, connections with Japanese figures and Korean exile Pak Yŏng-hyo, support for Japan during the Russo-Japanese War, and involvement with the pro-Japanese Ilchinhoe via the Chinbohoe and the Taehan Hyŏphoe. Son confirms each point with a simple "That is so." The author concludes that his overriding impression was one of Son's "greatness."

For historians, this piece offers a valuable first-hand glimpse into the trial atmosphere and the specific accusations leveled against Son Pyŏng-hŭi, a major nationalist figure. It starkly highlights the complex and sometimes contradictory path taken by prominent Koreans during the late Chosŏn and colonial periods, acknowledging Son's involvement in both anti-government/nationalist actions (Tonghak, March 1st Movement) and activities viewed as collaborationist (support for Japan in 1904, Ilchinhoe connection). The reporter's subjective focus on Son's inherent "greatness" despite these controversial affiliations is also significant, reflecting contemporary perceptions.

法廷에 선 新聞記者의 印象
						柳光烈
1920年 어느 여름날 오전 10시경이엇다. 貞洞臨時 大法廷에서는 48人의 公判이 계속 개정할 때이라 나는 전과 가치 D社 기자로 筆記를 하기 위하야 들어갓섯는데 이날에 다른 피고는 한 사람도 出廷하지 아니하엿다. 病中 孫秉熙가 出廷한다고 법정 내외는 警官이 더욱 엄중히 경계하며 廷內의 간수도 數가 늘어 今時에 무슨 일이나 잇슬 듯이 얼골빗이 긴장하엿섯다.
자동차가 들어오더니 침대에 누흔대로 義菴 孫秉熙가 내리게 되엇다. 이 때까지 잔잔하던 池水가 별안간 바람이 지나가며 물결이 수렁수렁일 듯이 간수가 左奔右走하며 자동차에서 내리어 침대에 누은대로 數十名 간수가 廷內까지 운대를 태여간다. 廷內에 내리자 간수가 쭉-들러안저 경계를 하고 방청석에도 무슨 일이나 잇는 듯이 수선거린다.
재판장은 가장 장엄한 태도로 例와 가치 주소 성명을 뭇는데 孫義菴은 病中이라 그런지 語聲이 가늘엇다.
재판장은 혹 소래가 잘 안들어 焦閟한 듯이 한참 前後左右를 돌라 보더니 書記에게 가만히 눈짓한다. 書記는 가만가만히 法壇에서 被告席으로 내려온다. 被告席에 재판소 書記가 내려오는 일도 희귀한 일이다. 半身不遂로 몸의 자유를 일흔 孫義菴은 여전히 그 臣軀를 看守가 부축하는 속에 안저서 虎目가튼 눈을 딱 뜨고 一直線으로 法壇을 凝視한다. 아마 자기의 風雲만흔 과거를 회상하며 一種 감개가 깁헛든 것이겟지...＜34＞
재판장 被告는 일즉이 東學黨으로 明治27年頃中 韓國時代에 당시 정치에 불만을 품고 東學亂을 이르킨 일이 잇는가.
孫 그럿소.

裁 被告는 그 動亂이 日淸大兵이 와서 실패에 돌아감애 大邱에서 內亂罪로 사형에 처한 崔時享과 함께 망명하여 다니다가 崔時享이 잡힘애 中國의 李鴻章과 結託코자 中國으로 갓섯는가.
孫 그럿소.
裁 被告는 그 후 日本으로 가서 犬養毅頭山滿과 당시의 韓國 망명객 朴泳孝와 結託하야 朝鮮內政改革을 하려 하엿는가.
孫 그럿소.
...(中略-원문)...
裁 被告는 明治37年에 日露戰爭이 이러나매 東學黨을 식혀 日本을 도읍고 日本에 軍費를 기부한 일이 잇는가.

이러케 法廷에서 만난 인상은 역시 그가 크다는 것 외에는 업섯다.
