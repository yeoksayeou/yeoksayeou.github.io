The Studies of the Famous

Han Yongun (韓龍雲氏) - Mr. Han currently resides in Seoul at 40 An'guk-dong (安國洞), within the Dharma Hall (法堂) of the Tongnae Pŏmŏ Temple (東萊 梵魚寺) branch, having established the sole place of peaceful dwelling in the three realms (三界唯一의 安住地), living the life of a monk aspiring to attain Buddhahood and save all sentient beings (願成佛 度衆生). His study is right in the side room next to where the Buddha is enshrined. It is a rectangular, two-kan (unit of space), heated floor room (ondolbang). While a landscape folding screen (山水屛風) might be visible, one cannot see where the study is; only a few miscellaneous books (雜書數卷) and a daily newspaper rest atop a writing box (案頭文匣). Since he is someone said to have entered the mountains for many years (積年入山) and even excerpted the entire Eighty Thousand Tripitaka (八萬大藏經), he must surely be continuing his astonishing reading even now—however, seeing him rummage through the writing box because he had forgotten the end while reciting nearly ten Chinese poems (漢詩) he composed while imprisoned during the March First Movement (己未在獄), it seems that Mr. Han's ten thousand volumes of poetry and writings (萬卷詩書) on philosophy, literature, religion, etc., are mostly contained within his head. <41>

Yi Kwanyong (李灌鎔) - Among the studies of various gentlemen I have seen, I have not encountered one with as many books (藏書) and whose study's structure is as modern (모던) and refreshing (淸新) as this gentleman's. The fact that it is built as a two-story Western-style building (二層洋製) within a vast estate (宏濶한 莊園) of the era, located below Nak'ta Mountain (駱駝山), already means it has secured geographical advantage (地利). The panoramic view (俯瞰) of the myriad houses of Chang'an (長安萬戶 - referring to Seoul) as the morning haze lifts layer by layer was especially magnificent and tasteful (운치) from this second-floor balcony (二層露臺). The interior of the study is decorated in Western style (洋式), with a plaque reading "Ilsŏng Sŏjae" (一星書齋) attached to the front. The bookshelves, stacked high, are filled with original English and German books (英獨原書) bound in gilt lettering (金文). Atop the square table (四角卓子), reclining chair (橫臥椅子), and round rattan table (圓藤卓子), academic journals (학술잡지) received from various foreign countries are piled high. As two sides are made of glass windows, the intake of air and light (採風通光) was exceptionally good. (To be continued in the next issue) <41>

**Summary**

This article snippet describes the studies of two prominent Korean figures in 1930: the Buddhist monk and poet Han Yongun, and Yi Kwanyong. Han Yongun's study is depicted as an austere, spiritual space within a temple branch, reflecting his ascetic life and internalized knowledge rather than a large physical collection. In stark contrast, Yi Kwanyong's study is a modern, Westernized, luxurious room in a large estate, filled with foreign books and journals, emphasizing wealth, modernity, and outward intellectualism. For historians, the article offers a fascinating glimpse into the diverse lifestyles and values within colonial Korean society. The juxtaposition highlights the tension between traditional spirituality/resistance (Han Yongun, associated with the independence movement) and the modernizing, potentially collaborating, elite (Yi Kwanyong, with his Westernized affluence).
