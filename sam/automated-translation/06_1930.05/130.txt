By Duan Chengshi (段成式)

Branches intertwine their shadows, sealing the Long Gate (長門),
Their tender colors have yet to be moistened by the grace of rain and dew (雨露恩).
The phoenix carriage (鳳輦) does not come, desire is almost extinguished,
Only the orioles' songs remain in vain, reaching the dusk (黃昏).

By Guo Yuanzhen (郭元挺)

The branches of the roadside willow (楊柳),
Have already been blown by the spring wind (春風).
My heart (妾心) is truly breaking (斷絶),
How could your heart (君懷) ever know? <39>

**Summary**

This article presents two classical Chinese poems, one by Duan Chengshi and another attributed to Guo Yuanzhen (郭元挺), both titled "Sorrowful Lament of a Palace Lady". The poems express the themes of loneliness, neglect, and unfulfilled longing experienced by women confined within the palace, waiting in vain for the emperor's favor as time passes. From the perspective of Korean colonial history, the publication of these Tang dynasty poems in a popular Korean magazine in 1930 is noteworthy. It indicates the persistence of classical Chinese literary traditions and Sinocentric cultural literacy among Koreans during Japanese rule, showcasing a connection to a broader East Asian heritage that existed alongside the pressures of modernization and colonial influence. Historians might find this interesting as evidence of cultural continuity and the literary tastes valued by the readership of *Samch'ŏlli* during that period.
