摘花三題
						金岸曙

Willow

The weeping willows that played in the spring breeze,
Did they turn green before my heart as usual?
Their long branches swayed and swayed, dancing,
Perhaps they must have been broken by someone.

In Autumn

In the fine season of the third or fourth month, those fresh green willow branches,
Why did I break one off and give it to the love who departs year after year?
This evening, as the autumn wind whirls and all the leaves fall,
If my love were to come, what would I have to break off?

Looking into Clear Water

Like the texture of clouds must be my light hair by the ears,
Are my shaped eyebrows like the crescent moon?
Where the hairpin fell with a splash, parting the water chestnut leaves,
Looking into it, for what reason, my hair is disheveled.<75>

**Summary**

This work by Kim An-sŏ consists of three short poems exploring themes of natural beauty, parting, memory, and self-reflection. The first poem uses the image of a willow potentially broken, hinting at vulnerability or loss. The second poem contrasts the act of giving a willow branch (a symbol of parting) in spring with the barrenness of autumn, expressing longing and the passage of time. The third poem shifts to a personal reflection upon seeing oneself in water, comparing features to nature but ending with the mundane observation of messy hair. From a historical perspective, the poems are interesting as examples of lyrical expression using traditional Korean natural imagery during the colonial period. While not overtly political, the focus on personal sentiment, themes of loss, waiting, and the passage of time might resonate with the broader context of cultural persistence and subdued emotions under occupation. Historians might note the use of Hangul poetry incorporating Hansi thematic elements during a time of Japanese linguistic pressure.

버들
봄바람에 넘놀든 수양버들들
예대로 마음압헤 풀으럿든가?
긴가지 하늘하늘 춤을 추더니
아마도 누구한테 꺽기엿으리.

가을에
때죠흔 삼사월에 새파란버들가지
무어라 꺽거줫노 해마다가는님께
가을바람 휘돌아 닙다떨닌이져녁
만일에 님오시면 내 무얼꺽게하노

맑은 물을 딀다보며
구름결과 갓트리 나의가뷘귀밋털
지여노흔 눈섭은 初生달과갓달가
비네짬방 떨어져 마름닙갈나진곳
딀다보니, 웬일가, 머리가헛틀엇네.＜75＞
