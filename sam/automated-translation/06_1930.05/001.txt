Call for Open Letters
▲ Mr. Kim Pyŏngno ▲ Mr. Yi Kwangsu ▲ Mr. Song Chinu ▲ Mr. An Chaehong ▲ Mr. Ch'oe Rin ▲ (Alphabetical order... Above is the first round)

Our company will celebrate its first anniversary this coming June, and to mark this occasion with a meaningful event, we are widely soliciting open letters addressed to the five individuals listed above. This is because we firmly believe that the voice of the masses (大衆) is the voice of heaven, and when its grand, intelligent, and frank criticism descends, it carries authority like thunder and lightning (雷霆) and has the power to shatter evil (破邪) like the sun and moon (日月). Thus, these open letters, in the name of the masses, can become letters of advice urging worthy individuals to make way by seeking their withdrawal, or serve as notifications demonstrating the formidable support and backing of the masses for giants who ought to advance further, thereby aiding their great momentum. Only in this way can our culture be promoted, and can the pioneers (先駈者) and the populace become completely unified (渾然一體), don't you agree? We intend to continue creating opportunities for criticism of the many figures active in our society, but first, we earnestly hope that many individuals from all walks of life (江湖) will take up their pens for proper and stern criticism of the aforementioned five gentlemen.

Five Rules for Writing
▲ Scope: Please do not touch too much upon their political thoughts and activities, but focus on evaluating their public life in social and cultural aspects. While it is fine to write about their character, environment, or knowledge, personal attacks (人身攻擊) are strictly prohibited. Furthermore, the content must be such that it can pass the censorship of the police authorities (警務當局) without difficulty.
▲ Length: Within 20 pages of manuscript paper (10 lines per page, 24 characters per line).
▲ Publication Fee: There is no ■■ [likely 'fee'], but please be sure to notify our company. Submitted manuscripts will not be returned under any circumstances.
▲ Publication: We plan to publish these in the first-anniversary commemorative issue on June 1st, so please ensure manuscripts arrive at our company by May 20th.
▲ Please write about one person among the five mentioned above. A small token of appreciation (薄謝) will be presented for those published in the magazine.

**Summary**

*Samch'ŏlli* magazine announces a call for readers to submit "open letters" critically evaluating five prominent Korean figures (Kim Pyŏngno, Yi Kwangsu, Song Chinu, An Chaehong, Ch'oe Rin) for its upcoming first-anniversary issue. The magazine frames this as giving voice to the "masses," whose criticism holds great power, either to encourage figures to step aside or to bolster those deserving of support, thus unifying intellectuals/leaders and the populace for cultural progress. Strict guidelines are provided regarding scope (focus on social/cultural life, avoid politics/personal attacks, pass censorship), length, deadline, and submission details.

This article is historically significant as it reflects an attempt by a popular Korean magazine under Japanese colonial rule to foster public discourse and critical engagement with contemporary Korean intellectual and cultural figures. The list of figures itself (including prominent nationalists and intellectuals, some with complex political trajectories) is notable. The explicit mention of police censorship ("警務當局의 檢閱에 無難通過할것이라야 함니다") starkly reveals the constraints on expression during this period, forcing the magazine to navigate carefully between encouraging critique and ensuring publication. Historians might find the framing of "mass criticism" and the selection of figures insightful regarding cultural politics and the negotiation of public space under colonialism.
