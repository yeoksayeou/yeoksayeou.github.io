The Fragrance of Fine Writing, After Parting
						梁柱東 (Yang Chu-dong)
I see the footprints.
I see the footprints.
Clear upon the sand
I see the footprints.
The tracks my friend trod one day
The tracks of the friend I cannot see
Perhaps my friend, these footprints
Will tread again and return?

Though my beloved is unlikely to come this way
Though my beloved were truly to return
The wind, the waves, washing the sand
How could they find the tracks of old?

I see the footprints.
I see the footprints.
Tiny by the sea
I see the footprints.<74>

**Summary**

This poem by Yang Chu-dong evokes a sense of longing and loss after parting from a friend or lover ("벗님," "님"). The speaker observes footprints on the sand by the sea, reminiscing about the absent person and pondering the possibility of their return. However, the speaker recognizes the ephemeral nature of these traces, acknowledging that the wind and waves will inevitably erase the footprints, just as time and distance obscure memories and prevent reunion. The poem captures the bittersweet feeling of remembering someone while accepting the permanence of their absence. For historians, the poem reflects personal sentiments and lyrical expression prevalent in Korean literature during the colonial period, showcasing themes of separation and longing which could resonate with the broader context of displacement or loss felt under colonial rule, albeit expressed on a personal scale. The use of older Korean orthography is also of linguistic interest.

발자욱을 봄니다.

모래우에 또렷한
발자욱을 봄니다.
어느날 벗님이 밟고간자욱
못뵈올 벗님이 밟고간자욱
혹시나 벗님은 이발자욱을
다시금 밟으며 도라오려나.

님이야 이길로 올리업거만
님이야 정녕코 도라온단들
바람이 물결이 모래를싯처
녜날의 자욱을 어이차즈리.

발자욱을 봄니다.
발자욱을 봄니다.
바다가에 조고만
발자욱을 봄니다.＜74＞
