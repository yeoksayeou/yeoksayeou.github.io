The Purpose of Marriage

Newlywed Husband: "It's embarrassing even to say it, but I have just gone bankrupt."

Wife: "What kind of terrible thing is this! Then doesn't it look like I married you purely out of love? I hate it! I hate it, I don't know!" <35>

**Summary**

This short humorous piece presents a dialogue between a newlywed husband and wife. The husband confesses his bankruptcy, expecting sympathy. However, the wife is upset not by the financial ruin itself, but because it makes their marriage appear to be based solely on love, implying her actual motivation was financial. For historians, this snippet offers a cynical commentary on marriage motivations, potentially reflecting societal views or anxieties about economic status and relationships during the colonial period in Korea. It hints at pragmatic, perhaps mercenary, considerations underlying marriage for some women at the time.
