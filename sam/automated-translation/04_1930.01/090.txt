Pilgrimage of Talents (Part 1), Newspaper Side

Viewed broadly, Korea's talents seem endlessly numerous; viewed narrowly, they seem endlessly few. However, if one were to look through a telescope at the constellations in the sky, invisible to the naked eye, one would surely see countless stars twinkling brightly there. The method we will now take to seek out the talents of the Eight Provinces is indeed similar to observing the stars through a lens.

Even among talents, there will surely be countless variations: talents for construction, destruction, knowledge, wisdom, leadership, management, gathering and dispersing, governance, diplomacy, politics, economics, arts and sciences, and so on. However, in pointing out those who are currently contributing to our people's lives, those who have already contributed and stepped back, and those who are striving to contribute in the future, the order will be consistent. This will be the standard for our talent search.

This task will likely be exceedingly difficult. However, believing it is better to do something imperfectly than not at all, we intend to proceed by merely listing their faces and names, without delving too deeply into their capabilities. The inability to be detailed is partly due to lack of preparation, but also because introducing so many people one by one without omission is, in fact, an extremely difficult task. Therefore, we adopt this format, akin to viewing mountains from a running horse (走馬看山格).

Now, for Part 1, we begin our pilgrimage with the newspaper companies, the fountainhead of talent active at the forefront of society, having the most contact with the populace. Following this, we will make a pilgrimage through the Singanhoe, the Korean Youth General Alliance (靑總), the Korean Farmers General Alliance (農總), the Korean Labour General Alliance (勞總), and other various organizations. Next will be a pilgrimage through educators, from Kyŏngsŏng University down to professional schools, middle schools, common schools, and kindergartens. After that, a pilgrimage through religious circles such as Ch'ŏndogyo, Protestantism (耶蘇敎), and Buddhism (佛敎). Then, we move to a pilgrimage of the business world, including banks, companies, and factories. Following that will be a pilgrimage of lawyers, public activists (公人運動家), and magazine publishers. Finally, we will shift to a pilgrimage of the artist group, including writers, painters, actors, and authors (著術家). We ask for your generosity (雅量) in forgiving any errors that may occur.<28>

Tong-a Ilbo (東亞日報)

Let's start with Tong-a Ilbo President Song Chin-u (宋鎭禹). He is from Tamyang, Chŏnnam Province, born in Kae'guk 499 (1890). He went to study in Japan wearing a topknot (상투), finished Meiji University's (明大) Law Department, returned to Korea, served as principal of Chungang School,<29> then became one of the 33 signatories [of the March 1st Declaration], and thirdly, became President of the Tong-a Ilbo from 1921. During that time, he attended the Pacific Conference in Hawaii and Tokyo. His pen name is Koha (古下). He has no published books but expresses his opinions frequently through newspaper editorials. It is heard that a certain editorial published on the second day of the Tong-a Ilbo's founding, which was confiscated, was the first one written by him, setting the first record of a private newspaper editorial confiscation. Furthermore, according to public rumor, the Tong-a Ilbo has two presidents: one is the active Song Koha, and the other is the reserve Kim Sŏng-su (金性洙). Hearing this, it seems plausible indeed, as the two have constantly exchanged political power, or rather, company power (社權), for the past 10 years. Kim Sŏng-su, from Chŏlp'o (茁浦), Chŏnbuk Province, is a 1914 graduate of Waseda University's Politics and Economics Department, born in Kae'guk 500 (1891). His pen name is Inch'on (仁村). He is the leader (盟主) of four major trusts: the Tong-a Ilbo newspaper, Haedong Bank (海東銀行), Chungang High Common School (中央高普), and Kyŏngsŏng Spinning (京城紡績) in Yŏngdŭngp'o for industry. Currently touring Europe and America, he likely belongs to the talents of dispersal (能散之材). Vice President Chang Tŏk-su (張德秀) is known for the Yŏ Un-hyŏng incident. He was chief editor (主筆) at the founding (草創時) of Tong-a Ilbo at age 24, exiled (流配) to a remote southern island as a young politician at 21 or 22, and won second place in Waseda University's All-Japan Oratorical Contest as a student around 20, showing he was quite precocious (早塾). Born in Chaeryŏng, currently studying in the United States, aged 37. Editor-in-Chief Yi Kwang-su (李光洙), pen name Ch'unwŏn (春園), born Kae'guk 501 (1892), from Chŏngju, P'yŏngbuk Province. Popularly known as one of the "Three Talents of Chŏngju" along with Hyŏn Sang-yun (玄相允) and Mun Il-p'yŏng (文一平), or one of the "Three Talents of Korea" with Pyŏkch'o (碧初 - Ch'oe Nam-sŏn) and Yuktang (六堂 - Ch'oe Nam-sŏn). During his studies at Waseda University, he was a scholarship student and displayed pioneering talent in literature and ideology from that time. Illness has significantly hindered his growth. He recently succeeded Chu Yo-han (朱耀翰), who stepped down due to the recent incident, returning to his current position not long ago. He is concurrently a director of the Suyang Tonguhoe. He has numerous published works including novels, poems, and essays.

He first finished Osan School, entered Tokyo Higher Normal School, but couldn't receive his diploma due to imprisonment following the March First Movement. Later, he entered Tōyō University's Philosophy Department, graduated, and then went to Kyoto Imperial University's Economics Department, where he received instruction from Kawakami Hajime (河上肇).

In the Society Department, Hyŏn Chin-gŏn (玄鎭健), aged 31, a Kyŏngsŏng native with handsome features (眉目秀麗), is famous as a short story writer, almost like the "Chekhov of Korea."

Chung-oe Ilbo (中外日報)

Among newspaper presidents, there's the type who personally takes up the pen to decide the company's direction (社是) and energetically leaps across the pages (縱橫飛躍), and then there's the type who doesn't, instead serving as the company's public face, overseeing external relations (外面) and internal management (內面).

**Summary**

This 1930 article from "Samch'ŏlli" magazine introduces prominent figures working at three major Korean newspapers under Japanese colonial rule: Chosŏn Ilbo, Tong-a Ilbo, and Chung-oe Ilbo. It profiles presidents, vice presidents, editors-in-chief, and key journalists across various departments (editorial, politics, economics, society, arts/culture, local, women's), detailing their education (often in Japan or abroad), notable works (writings, translations, art), pen names, ages, hometowns, and sometimes political affiliations or past activities, including involvement in nationalist movements like the March First Movement and Singanhoe, and resulting imprisonment. The article serves as a "who's who" of the Korean intellectual and media scene at the time, intending to be the first in a series covering talents in various fields.

From a historical perspective, this piece is valuable for its detailed snapshot of the Korean elite involved in the press during a critical period of colonial history. It reveals the educational backgrounds (especially the prevalence of study in Japan at institutions like Waseda University), the interconnections between individuals across different newspapers and nationalist organizations (like Singanhoe), and the explicit mention of political activities, imprisonment ("iron window life"), and even left-wing affiliations, despite the likely censorship environment (indicated by "XXXX"). The profiles offer insights into the careers, intellectual leanings, and social networks of individuals who significantly shaped public discourse and cultural production in colonial Korea.
