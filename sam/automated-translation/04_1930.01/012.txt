A Great National Undertaking!!

We must live well. To live well, although we must have a trained multitude of people, we must also produce even more outstanding thinkers, scientists, and artists. Now, as a token of devotion dedicated to "Great Chosŏn" (大朝鮮), this magazine establishes the "Samch'ŏlli" Science Prize and Art Prize to call forth excellent popular talents, and we offer them to our society. Although the prize money may be small, we ask that all meaningful members of the public use this prize significantly in constructing the Golden Age of Chosŏn Culture (朝鮮文化의 黃金時代建設).

Establishment of the "Samch'ŏlli Prize" (三千里賞) - Founded starting in 1930
◎ "Science Prize" = Presented annually, 100 Wŏn
◎ "Art Prize" = Presented annually, 100 Wŏn

▲Regulations (規程) = The Science Prize is presented to one person each year who has invented an outstanding theory in social science or natural science or established a sound guiding theory, offering this amount as partial support for their research. The first award will be presented in early 1931 after examining achievements up to the end of December 1930. Likewise (亦), the first [Art] prize will be presented in early 1931 based on achievements in 1930. We will continue to select and present both prizes anew each year.
▲Selection (推撰) = All authorities in these fields will be gathered (斯界權威總網羅) (Names to be announced later = Other detailed regulations (詳規) also to be announced later) <1>

**Summary**

This editorial note from the January 1930 issue of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine announces the establishment of the annual "Samch'ŏlli Prize" for Science and Art, each worth 100 Wŏn. The magazine frames this initiative as a "great national undertaking" necessary for the prosperity of "Great Chosŏn" (大朝鮮) and the building of a "Golden Age of Chosŏn Culture." The prizes aim to encourage outstanding thinkers, scientists, and artists, with the first awards scheduled for early 1931 based on 1930 achievements, selected by a panel of experts yet to be named. For historians, this article is interesting as it reflects cultural nationalist aspirations within the colonial context, emphasizing intellectual and artistic achievement as crucial for national advancement, even while using terms like "Great Chosŏn." The establishment of such prizes by a private magazine highlights non-governmental efforts to foster Korean cultural development under Japanese rule.
