**Summary**

This short notice lists three articles—a travelogue by Hŏ Hŏn, an autobiography by Hong Myŏng-dae, and the life story of a gold mine king by Kangch'on Kŏsa—that were planned for publication but ultimately omitted due to unspecified "circumstances". From a historical perspective, this brief editorial note is intriguing because the vague reason "circumstances" (事情) often alluded to external pressures, such as censorship by the Japanese Government-General or self-censorship by the publisher, during the colonial period. Historians might find this useful as indirect evidence of the constraints faced by Korean publications in expressing content freely under Japanese rule.
