**Summary**

This article is an announcement and appeal from Samch'ŏlli Company, the publisher of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine, dated January 1930. The company pledges consistent monthly publication, improved content, and expanded book publishing efforts. To support these goals, it solicits readers to become "Company Friends" (社友) by contributing a membership fee. Two tiers are offered: Ordinary Friends (1 Won 50 Chŏn for a one-year subscription and book discounts) and Special Friends (10 Won or more for a lifetime subscription and discounts). Instructions are provided for sending payment via postal transfer to their Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul) address. For historians, this piece offers insight into the operational and financial strategies of a Korean cultural enterprise during the Japanese colonial period, highlighting its reliance on reader support and its ambition to contribute culturally ("serve the nation through publishing"). The mention of specific contemporary authors like Ch'unwŏn and Kim Tongin, along with the use of colonial-era place names and systems like postal transfer, provides valuable context about cultural production and daily life at the time.
