**Body Text Translation:**
Among literary men, the one who most luxuriously adorns his person is likely the novelist Mr. Kim Tongin. As he once possessed a great fortune of 200,000 won, there was a time he wasted several hundred won on a phonograph hobby, carried a watch worth over 150 won, and when it came to Western suits, he would deliberately come up to Seoul from P'yŏngyang to go to the famous first-class Chinese tailor shop called Tongwŏnt'ae (東源泰) behind Tŏksu Palace and have one made for 130 or 140 won. His shoes would be patent leather (漆皮) and enamelled, and his hats imported goods (舶來品)! He was an aristocratic type who lived like this, and though the money in his hand now is not much (不多), his style is either to have good things or nothing at all, adorning himself with expensive items (高價品). The suit he wears now cost 55 won, his shoes 13 won, his collar, and his hat is a 4-won semi-imported item (半舶來品), only his walking stick is a meager 1 won 50 jeon item.

Another novelist, Mr. Yŏm Sangsŏp, originally has a free-spirited (豪脫) personality and doesn't particularly care (介節치 않어서) about clothing. In summer, he wears a ramie durumagi (traditional coat) with crumpled creases and a 50-jeon straw hat (麥藁帽子); in winter, he wears white clothes (白衣)—white trousers and jacket—sometimes even straw sandals (집신) <150> or drags on rubber shoes. Mr. Yŏm neither imitates the current modern (時體 모던) style nor dislikes dressing like a nobleman's son (貴公子). That must be part of his character, like the style of his works—rugged yet tenacious, becoming more flavorful the more you chew on them.

Speaking of rugged individuals, Ch'unwŏn (春園) Mr. Yi Kwangsu is also like that. Nowadays, he even shaves his head bald like a Buddhist monk (道僧), wears dark tortoiseshell-framed (대모테) glasses on his bony face with prominent cheekbones, and his manner (凡節) of dressing is such that his wife, Mrs. Hŏ (許女士), must be vexed—he doesn't know how to dress up or wear clothes neatly. The hat he currently wears is one that the couple (兩主) bought for him once when they went for a spring day (春日) stroll (山步) to Chŏngja-ok (丁子屋). When they actually went inside, she was so envious of the appearance of the fashionable young men (時體男兒) dressed immaculately from head to toe, that she decided to make her husband a modern gentleman. She took out a large (大枚) 10-won banknote (紙幣) she had tucked away for buying various household items (살님 긔구) and bought him the best hat there for 7 won. At that time, his top and bottom matched, but all things age and wear out. That 7-won imported hat (舶來帽子), after being worn for 3 or 4 years, is now stained (때뭇고) and crumpled (꾸기여저), likely not even fetching a good price from an antique dealer (古物商), yet Ch'unwŏn still wears it on his head and goes out nonchalantly. It seems a revolution will only happen if there's another trip to Chŏngja-ok this spring. If his hat is like this, how different could his suit, shoes, necktie, or dress shirt be? The rest are all like this (餘皆倣此).

Poet Ansŏ (岸曙), shall we say, is one who cannot enjoy the blessings (恩澤) of material goods (物貨) due to poverty. Ansŏ wears a Western suit made of formal wear fabric (禮服地), bought for 37 won because of unfavorable circumstances (勢 不利), straight through spring, summer, autumn, and winter (春夏秋冬)—all four seasons (四節氣)—so that the fabric (地) is now worn out and reflects sunlight (太陽光線) like a mirror. His hat too, a dark one bought three years ago, he wears even during the hottest days of summer (三伏), dripping sweat. Shall we call it the appearance (風貌) of an old philosopher (老哲學者)? <151>

**Summary**

This 1935 article describes the contrasting fashion senses of four prominent Korean literary figures: Kim Tongin, Yŏm Sangsŏp, Yi Kwangsu (Ch'unwŏn), and Kim Ŏk (Ansŏ). Kim Tongin is portrayed as extravagant, favoring expensive imported goods and tailored suits. Yŏm Sangsŏp is indifferent to fashion, often wearing traditional or simple clothes. Yi Kwangsu is similarly unkempt and frugal, much to his wife's chagrin, continuing to wear old, worn-out items like a hat bought years ago. Poet Ansŏ is depicted as poorly dressed due to poverty, wearing the same worn suit year-round. The article reveals much about individual personalities through their clothing choices during the colonial period. Historians might find the details on clothing prices (suits, shoes, hats), specific shops (Tongwŏnt'ae tailor, Chŏngja-ok department store), the mention of imported vs. domestic/semi-imported goods, and the juxtaposition of Western attire (洋服) with traditional Korean clothing (모시두루막이, 白衣, 집신) interesting for studying consumer culture, social status expression, and the blending of modern and traditional lifestyles in 1930s Seoul.

文士들의 洋服, 구두, 帽子
文人치고 가장 제 신변을 호화롭게 차리는 이는 소설가 金東仁씨리라. 氏는 20만원의 巨財를 가진 젹이 잇섯느니만치 한 때는 留聲機道樂으로 수백원을 버리엇고, 시계도 150여원짜리를 몸에 지녓고 양복이라 하면 평양서 일부러 서울 올너와 德壽宮 뒤에 잇는 東源泰라는 유명한 일류 중국 양복점에 가서 백삼사십원을 주고 마치고, 구두면 칠피에 「에나멜드」요, 모자면 舶來品! 이러한 생활을 하든 귀족적 타입이라 지금도 손에 쥔 돈은 不多하나 하면 조흔 것 안하면 그만이다 식으로 고가품을 몸에 부친다. 지금 입고 다니는 양복도 55원짜리 구두는 13원짜리 깃도, 모자는 4원짜리 半舶來品, 스틱만은 빈약하게 1원 50전짜리인저.

가튼 소설가로 廉想涉씨는 원래 성격이 豪脫하야 의복에는 그리 介節치 안어서, 녀름이면 줄이 꼬깃꼬깃한 모시두루막이에 50전짜리 麥고모자, 겨을이면 白衣인 힌 바지저고리에 각금 집신도 신고<150> 고무신도 끄을고- 氏는 時體 모던도 숭내내지 안코 그러타고 귀공자와 가튼 차림하기도 스려 한다. 그는 일종 성격이리라. 작품에 무텁텁하면서 줄기차고 씹으면 씹을사록 맛나는 그 품격 모양으로.

텁텁한 분이라면 春園 李光洙氏도 그러하다. 요지간은 머리까지 道僧가치 박박 깍가버리고 광대뼈가 나온 열골에는 거문 대모테 안경을 썻스며 그 옷 입은 凡節도 그 부인 許여사가 속타하리만치 치장할  줄도 곱게 입을 줄도 모른다. 지금 쓰고 잇는 모자는 언젠가 兩主가 丁子屋으로 春日의 산보를 갓는데 막상 드러가 보니 時體 남아들이 아래우를 지름에 씨슨 듯 말숙하게 치장하고 다니는 모양이 하도 부러워 남편을 모던 신사를 만들 작정으로 살님 긔구 이것저것 사려고 꼬귀어 쥐엇든 大枚 10원짜리 지폐를 내어 그 중에 제일 조흔 모자 한아를 7원 주고 사드렷다. 그 때는 아래우가 어울니더니, 만물은 늙고 낡는지라 7원짜리 그 舶來모자도 3,4년 쓰고 지내는 사이에 이제는 때뭇고 꾸기여저 고물상에서도 잘 사주지안케 되엿건만 春園은 여전히 머리에 모시고 태연히 외출한다. 금년 봄쯤, 또 丁子屋 행차가 잇서야 혁명이 될 모양, 모자가 이럴 바에야 양복인들, 구두인들, 넥타인들, 와이싸스인들 다르랴, 다 餘皆倣此다.

詩人 岸曙는 가난 때문에 物貨의 恩澤을 못입는 이라 할가. 岸曙는 옷도 勢 不利하야 37원인가 주고 산 禮服地 洋服을 춘하추동, 4절기를 쭉-내리뽑아 입어 이제는 地가 달어 태양 광선이 거울가치 반사한다. 모자도 3년 전에 산 거문 모자를 三伏에도 땀 흘니며 쓰고다닌다. 老철학자의 風貌라고 할가. <151>
