Although this is already an old story, whenever Yi Tong-hwi (李東輝), who used to stay in Myŏngdong Ch'on (明東村), Kando (間島), occasionally had business requiring travel to Kukcha Street (局子街), he would put on Chinese shoes (중국 도레기) at night, eat dinner, and set off on the night road, arriving at Kukcha Street by dawn. The distance from Myŏngdong to Kukcha Street is a 90-li road in Chosŏn (朝鮮) li. It was a walk requiring steadily walking at a fairly fast pace (速步).

Moreover, during seasons like the severe winter cold, his feet would blister and his whole body would freeze— However, it is said that once he finished his business there, he would again walk the 90 li back to Myŏngdong Ch'on within the same day.<151>

**Summary**

This short anecdote recounts the remarkable physical endurance of Yi Tong-hwi during his time in Myŏngdong Ch'on, Kando. He would regularly walk 90 li (about 35 km) overnight from Myŏngdong Ch'on to Kukcha Street for business, arriving by dawn. After finishing his tasks, he would walk the same 90 li back the same day, even enduring harsh winter conditions that caused blisters and freezing. For historians, this piece offers a glimpse into the difficult conditions and personal sacrifices made by Korean independence activists operating in Manchuria, highlighting Yi Tong-hwi's dedication and the sheer physical challenges involved in their activities.
