Regarding the Collection of Masterpieces

The "Collection of Masterpieces" (名作選), which gathered and specially featured masterpieces from the Peninsula's (半島) literary world of the past 20 years in this magazine's New Year issue and this March issue, has received激讚 (great praise) from the Peninsula's readership. However, unfortunately, among the writers requested by our company, there were several individuals (數氏) who did not consent and were thus omitted, which was regrettable. Furthermore, due to page count limitations, several other writers (數氏) were also omitted, for which we feel quite sorry.<185>

**Summary**

This editorial postscript from the March 1935 issue of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine addresses the reception and editorial choices behind their special feature, "Collection of Masterpieces," which showcased 20 years of Korean literature. While noting the feature's positive reception, the editors express regret that some requested authors declined participation and others had to be omitted due to space constraints. For historians, this brief note is interesting as it reflects the active literary scene and efforts to canonize Korean works during the colonial period. The mention of authors declining participation could hint at various underlying reasons, possibly including political sensitivities or disagreements with the magazine's editorial direction, offering a small window into the complexities faced by writers and publishers under Japanese rule.
