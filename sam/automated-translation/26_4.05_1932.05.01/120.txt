President Song's Rumored Trip Abroad

There is talk that Song Chin-u (宋鎭禹), president of the Tonga Ilbo (東亞日報), will travel abroad. Meanwhile, An Chae-hong (安在鴻), former president of the competing newspaper Chosŏn Ilbo (朝鮮日報), leaving behind the fine spring season (三春佳節) of the flower-blooming capital (花爛春城), is leading a life of misfortune (不遇) at "Hyŏnjŏ-dong 101" (峴底洞 101번지). This contrast is too painful.

Is President Song truly following former president Kim Sŏng-su (金性洙) by traveling abroad? It is indeed a curious matter.

Army Colonel

A letter arrived from Mr. Yi Yang (李亮). In the letter, it says, 「I have completely become a Manchukuo (滿洲) person. Furthermore, as I am a soldier of the Manchukuo (滿洲國) military, I don't know what will become of me, but I have drawn my sword. (Abbreviated from original (下略-원문))」

And the address given was Harbin (哈爾濱)...... Adjutant's Office, Headquarters for Railway Protection, [Manchukuo] Province (本省鐵路護路總司令部 副官處). There was a rumor that he had become an Army Colonel (陸軍大佐) in Manchukuo (滿洲國), and it seems that rumor was true.<11>

**Summary**

This short news piece reports two rumors circulating in 1932 Korea. The first concerns Song Chin-u, president of the Tonga Ilbo newspaper, potentially traveling abroad, contrasting his situation with the hardship faced by An Chae-hong, former president of the rival Chosŏn Ilbo. The second confirms, via a letter excerpt, that Yi Yang has become an Army Colonel in the military of the newly established Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo. Historically, the article is revealing as it juxtaposes the differing paths taken by prominent Korean figures under Japanese colonialism: potential privilege or freedom (Song), nationalist hardship (An), and collaboration with Japanese expansionism (Yi). This highlights the complex pressures and choices individuals faced during this period.
