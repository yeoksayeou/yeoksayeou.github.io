*Reporter's Note* = Yang Kŭnhwan has been confined in prison for 11 years now. Judging from his recent letters received by his elder brother, Mr. Yang Chinhwan, living in Sungsam-dong, Seoul, and through an interview conducted when a Samch'ŏlli Company Tōkyō correspondent visited Kōsuga Prison last November, his health is extremely good. His spirit is also fresh. Now, while spending 11 years gazing at the cold moon through iron bars, Yang Kŭnhwan wrote a line in the morning and a page in the evening, compiling a prison diary that amounts to 7 volumes. These are three works titled "The Light of the Four Seas" (四海の光), "Record of Thoughts and Feelings" (感想錄), and "Record of Collected Writings" (書集記).
While this voluminous work will eventually be published coherently and continuously in the future, our company has obtained important excerpts from the prison diary first, which we publish here. However, as it is too long, we are initially publishing only the first section. On this occasion, we report on the current status of Yang Kŭnhwan's family: his wife, Ishikawa Umeko, stayed for some time in her husband's hometown of Pakch'ŏn, Hwanghae Province, but returned to her own hometown some time ago. Their young daughter, Sunja, entered Paehwa School in Seoul this year and is studying hard. Yang Kŭnhwan's elder brother, Mr. Yang Chinhwan, is a man of strong character who works day and night, worrying about easing his younger brother's anxieties. Yang Kŭnhwan, whose life sentence was commuted, now has one and a half years left and will be a free man under the sky on August 30th of next year [1933]. While eagerly awaiting the day of his release, let us look at the prison diary he has written over 11 years.
Furthermore, to enrich our understanding of him, let us first look at the prison letters he sent out to his elder brother and close friends.
As they are letters sent from prison, they are not in Korean script, but we will print them in their original text.

To Ch'oe Sŭngman
and Wŏn Talho, Beloved Elder Brothers,
From your devoted younger brother, Yang Kŭnhwan, at Kōsuga Prison

A moment's pain is erased, and a moment's joy makes one feel as if ten years of fatigue are forgotten. It is commonly said, "Hearing a hundred times or reading ten letters is not as good as seeing once," and this is what I am experiencing now. Just as the solitary pine standing tall on the snow-covered eastern ridge amidst the decay of all things, and the fragrance of three plum blossoms amidst the accumulated frost and snow, further demonstrates the value of the pine and makes one feel the preciousness of the plum even more, so too does the great affection of friendship I always receive in this lonely isolation, separated from the world at the ends of the earth, truly make me forget sorrow and grief. Pain and loneliness are all cancelled out, and unconsciously, a radiant smile naturally appears. This is my joy, more precious and truly valuable than those pines and plums.
If I were to say I have sorrow today, this would be my true sorrow. If I were to say I have joy today, this would surely be my true joy. (Omitted - original text) The wise prevent misfortune before it sprouts, and the intelligent plan for trouble with the future in mind. (Omitted - original text) Although burst water is painful, it is better than nurturing poison. Even if one calls for a boat while drowning, it will be too late. Thus was my intention to prevent all things beforehand. (Omitted - original text) If one cannot endure small things, one disrupts great plans. (Omitted - original text) As I reflect upon myself, thinking left and right, although I find no great fault of my own, anyway, now is the time to endure all, forge all, and refine all. Now is the time for all my silence. (Omitted below - original text) Please convey my best regards to all the students studying in Japan.

To my nephew Sŏngbok, for his immediate attention

Though the land is distant, people are near through messages. Missing you day and night for quite a long time, my feelings grow deeper with time. Then, last month, I suddenly received your postcard. My joy was like scratching an itch while lying side-by-side in bed. Ah, though letters have no feet, they can travel a thousand *ri* of distant roads; though characters have no mouth, they can speak words to console the sorrowful. Is it not lamentable that we humans cannot overcome mere scraps of paper? Is it not difficult? If one cannot take a single step without relying on another's intention, nor speak a single word, how is one different from a pig in a pen? Alas, even a beast large enough to require a cart (函車之獸), if it leaves the mountains, cannot escape the calamity of nets and snares (崗罟之患). Even a fish large enough to swallow a boat (呑舟之魚), if it loses water, can be tormented by ants. Therefore, birds and beasts do not dislike heights, and fish do not dislike depths. Is this unique only to beasts and fish? We humans are also thus. Even a hero outstanding among ten thousand people, if he once loses the right path (正道), cannot escape the calamity of imprisonment (獄裡之患). Whom can one blame, whom can one resent? Water does not flow backward, wind does not turn back – such is the principle of nature (自然之理). Though fallen blossoms are regrettable, how can they return to the branch? It is solely the working of nature (無外自然之任). (Omitted below - original text)

Reply Letter to Elder Brother

A ten-thousand *ri* distant road is shrunk onto paper; ten years of long-held feelings are described at the tip of a brush. Regarding future matters (Omitted - original text) However, Confucius said, "If one hears the Way in the morning, one may die content in the evening." Also, a Buddhist disciple said, "Practicing the Way for one day is better than a lifespan of a hundred years." Is this not so? If a person born into this world achieves no great deeds for their time and furthermore does not leave a fragrant name for a thousand autumns, even if their life reaches a full hundred years, living drunk and dying as if in a dream, they cannot avoid the lament of being like decaying wood in deep mountains and secluded valleys (深山幽谷禲木之歎). Is this not regrettable? Is this not sorrowful? I have heard that a brave general does not fear death to seek a temporary escape, and a valiant warrior does not compromise integrity to seek survival. Are these not righteous words? Furthermore, it is said that on the day a general receives his command, he forgets his family; when setting up camp in the field, he forgets his parents; and when grasping the drumstick and beating the drum, he forgets himself. Are these not shepherd's words [meaning wise counsel]? Alas! To have knowledge but not use it, to have ambition but not act on it – how is this different from those without knowledge or ambition? This use and action depend on time and circumstances. What more can be done? Wait for what is not permitted, do not go against the flow of nature, know self-contentment. When propriety is lost, the Way comes first. (Omitted below - original text)

Reply Letter to Elder Brother

(Omitted above - original text) Since being imprisoned last year, without missing a single day, morning, noon, and night, three times, I have received delivered meals (private food), clothing, miscellaneous expenses, and lawyers – for the first trial, Doctor of Law Hanai Takuzō, Eki Law Scholar [likely Eki Tadashi], Tsukazaki, and two other lawyers whose names I don't even know; for the second trial, Hanai, Tsukazaki, Inamoto, and perhaps one more person, but generally these. Truly, this was unexpected for me. I don't even know how to express my gratitude for the undeserved sincerity and sympathy from my school friends. It was such that I couldn't possibly refuse under the circumstances. Ah, brother, who would deliver even a single meal box to someone abandoned by the world for this crime? (Omitted - original text) Also, in your letter, you wrote about 'Aiko' [愛子, meaning 'beloved child', could refer to a deceased child]. Let's stop talking about the dead altogether from now on. However, I am somewhat grateful that you went to my hometown and buried the bones.
Brother, I try to forget all about family and worldly affairs, but Kazuko [賀津子, likely his wife Umeko] sometimes sends letters wanting to know the child's well-being. Please send her a letter saying the child is playing safely. (Omitted below - original text)
"This letter was sent immediately after Yang was imprisoned ten years ago and was dated February 27th."

Reflections (述懷) by Yang Kŭnhwan (梁槿煥)

Turning my head to the western sky, how many tears have fallen?
For ten years, day and night, I've waited long for letters.

Feelings of longing are hard to write, only yearning persists,
Holding the brush, stroking my heart, emotions well up and block my throat.

A will separated from the world at the far eastern edge, ten thousand *ri* away,
A single thread winds in my chest, tied to the suffering hometown.

News from old friends is cut off, I wish to reconnect,
Standing fixedly at the iron window, I send this poem.

Prison Diary Excerpt
(Omitted above - original text) At that time, I secretly stole 670 won from the shop safe of my elder brother-in-law [사형 - likely referring to the husband of an elder sister or female cousin, but could potentially mean 'elder brother figure' depending on context] and put it in my pocket, then returned home. And I first decided to go to Russia. After going to Seoul, by train (Continued in the next issue)<9>

**Summary**

This 1932 Samch'ŏlli magazine article introduces excerpts from the prison diary and letters of Yang Kŭnhwan, a Korean imprisoned in Kōsuga Prison, Tōkyō, for 11 years. The introduction details his upcoming release, his family situation (brother Yang Chinhwan, wife Ishikawa Umeko, daughter Sunja), and his extensive prison writings. The included letters (mostly in Japanese) express gratitude for support, philosophical reflections on hardship and endurance, advice to his nephew, and practical concerns addressed to his brother, including mentions of his legal defense team and poignant requests regarding family communication, particularly about his wife and daughter, while asking to cease discussion of a deceased child. A short poem expresses his longing, and a final diary excerpt recounts stealing money before planning to flee to Russia.

For historians, this article offers valuable insights into the experiences of Korean political prisoners under Japanese colonial rule. It reveals personal reflections, communication networks (family, friends, fellow students), the practicalities of prison life (receiving food, legal aid), and the emotional toll of long-term incarceration. The mix of Korean, Japanese, and Hanmun reflects the linguistic realities of the educated class during this period. The mention of specific Japanese lawyers involved in his defense (like Hanai Takuzō) and the family's transnational connections (Japanese wife, daughter in a Korean school) highlight the complex interactions between Koreans and Japanese. The final diary excerpt hints at the circumstances leading to his imprisonment.
