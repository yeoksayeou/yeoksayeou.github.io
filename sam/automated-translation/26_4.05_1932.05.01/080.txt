忠告狀
無責任한 特選映畵

The *Tonga Ilbo* (東亞日報), *Chosŏn Ilbo* (朝鮮日報), and *Chungang Ilbo* (中央日報) are private newspapers of great authority. The moving picture "Ryoshū" (旅愁 - Traveller's Sorrow), which these three newspaper companies specially selected as a treat for their readers, was recently screened at the Chosŏn Theater (朝鮮劇場). However, that film was absolutely nothing but bourgeois (뿔조아적) sentiment and the adulterous conduct (痴行) of a married woman (人妻). Perhaps one could say there was some slight improvement (一進) in filming technique compared to previous ones?

On what grounds did the persons responsible at the three newspapers (三新聞) specially recommend (特書公薦) this film, saying it was good? If you did so solely out of artistic conscience, without impure, profit-seeking entanglements (利慾的 係累), then you gentlemen (諸君) cannot avoid being pitifully colorblind (色盲). Ask the thousands of audience members that night (當夜) how many people came away without cursing this irresponsible promotion (宣傳) by the three newspaper companies! (오라진 자가 몃 사람이나 되는가고!)

From now on, be careful. And thus, restore the authority of the newspapers' official public statements. <9>

**Summary**

This article harshly criticizes three major Korean newspapers (*Tonga Ilbo*, *Chosŏn Ilbo*, *Chungang Ilbo*) for irresponsibly promoting a Japanese film titled "Ryoshū" (Traveller's Sorrow). The author argues the film is morally objectionable, featuring only "bourgeois sentiment" and "adulterous conduct," and lacks significant artistic merit beyond minor technical improvements. The piece questions the newspapers' motives, suggesting either profit-driven entanglement or poor judgment ("colorblindness"), and cites audience anger as evidence. It concludes by admonishing the papers to be more cautious in their endorsements to regain public trust in their official statements. For historians, this piece offers insight into cultural consumption and criticism in colonial Korea, showing public engagement with media and anxieties about foreign cultural influences (specifically Japanese film) and perceived moral decline ("bourgeois sentiment," "adultery"). It also highlights the expected role and scrutinized authority of the Korean press during this period, even when dealing with cultural matters like film recommendations.

忠告狀
無責任한 特選映畵

東亞日報, 朝鮮日報, 中央日報라 하면 크게 권위잇는 민간신문들이다. 이 세 신문사에서 특선하엿다는 독자우대의 활동사진 「旅愁」가 日前 朝鮮劇場에 상영되엇다. 그런데 그 영화는 全然이 뿔조아적 센티멘트와 人妻의 痴行 이외에 아모 것도 업섯다. 다소 촬영기술에 잇서 종래보다 一進이 잇섯다 할가?
三新聞 책임자는 이 영화의 어느 부분이 조타고 特書公薦하엿는고. 불순한 利慾的 係累가 업시 오직 예술적 양심으로 그리 하엿다 하면 諸君은 애처러운 색맹을 未免할 것이다. 무러보라 當夜의 수 천 관객으로 三新聞社의 무책임한 이 宣傳에 욕설을 하지 안코 오라진 자가 몃 사람이나 되는가고!
금후부터는 주의할지어다. 그래서 신문사의 대외적 공식 성명의 권위를 회복할지어다. <9>
