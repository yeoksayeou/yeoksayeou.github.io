Magazine Title: 삼천리 제4권 제5호
Publication Date: 1932년 05월 01일
Article Title: 編輯後記 (Editorial Postscript)
Author: Not specified
Article Type: 사고·편집후기 (Notice/Editorial Postscript)

Starting from this issue, we have changed the format.

Furthermore, going forward, we will abandon the comprehensive editing approach and simplify the articles.

Also, we will include many articles in vernacular Korean (언문) and establish new sections for home and children.

There were many manuscripts for the May 1st issue that we were regrettably unable to publish, as listed below:
1. Samch'ŏlli General Meeting
2. Answers from Thirty Individuals (三十氏) Regarding a Certain Important Issue (某 중대문제)
3. Roundtable Discussion Recalling Important Incidents
4. May Day in the Russian Capital (露都)
5. General critiques of overseas nationalist figures and various other items.

The May 15th issue will definitely be published on its scheduled date (定期日).

It will be much better than this issue, so please look forward to it greatly.<2>

**Summary**

This editorial postscript from the May 1, 1932 issue of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine announces changes to its format, including simplification of articles, increased use of vernacular Korean (Hangul), and the addition of home and children's sections. It also lists several articles that were intended for the current issue but could not be published, such as reports on meetings, opinions on an important issue, a historical roundtable, May Day in Moscow, and critiques of overseas nationalists. The editors promise the next issue will be improved and published on schedule. From a historical perspective, the shift towards simpler articles in vernacular Korean and the introduction of domestic sections might reflect attempts to broaden readership or navigate censorship by focusing on less politically sensitive topics. However, the list of unpublished articles, particularly those concerning "important issues," "important incidents," "May Day in the Russian Capital," and "overseas nationalist figures," clearly indicates the magazine's engagement with potentially controversial political and social themes, highlighting the challenges and editorial decisions faced by Korean publications under Japanese colonial rule.
