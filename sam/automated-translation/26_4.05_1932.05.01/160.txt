文壇雜話 (Literary Scene Gossip)
The Slump of the America-Affiliated

There isn't a single literary man who returned after impressively earning some Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Philosophy degree in the United States (美國) who has shown genius-like activity. Creative writer Ch'uho Chŏn Yŏngt'aek (秋湖 田榮澤) returned after finishing some American university, then became a pastor at some rural church in Hwanghae Province and hasn't uttered a word since. Poet Kim Yŏje (金與濟), after quitting his position as academic supervisor at Osan High School (五山高普), has likewise not published any great work capable of moving the generation. Poet O Ch'ŏnsŏk (吳天錫) is also silent and unheard of. As for the other gentlemen, it's better not to speak of them. Among these, perhaps only Chu Yosŏp (朱耀燮) can be said to be presenting a distinctive theoretical front, at least with his discussions on literary arts and entertainment?
Where could the reason for the slump of America-affiliated literary men lie? Is it because the waves of the Pacific are too strong?

Mr. Tokkyŏn's Unexpected Misfortune (橫厄)

Novelist Ch'oe Tokkyŏn (崔獨鵑) went to his hometown Chaeryŏng in Hwanghae Province (黃海道 載寧) and upon his return, received a summons from the police station, was interrogated for a day, and came out without incident. He gave a wry smile at this unexpected misfortune (橫厄). If he managed to conceive the sequel to "Nanyŏng" (亂影) during that bizarre day, wouldn't that actually be a stroke of unexpected fortune instead?

Portents of a Great Revival in the Poetry Scene

Sijo poet Yi Ŭnsang (李殷相) resigned from Ewha Womans College (梨花女子專門) and immediately published (上梓) a collection of sijo. As his sijo already have the reputation of a master (巨匠), it will be evaluated very importantly in the literary world. Another thing is that Yang Chudong (梁柱東), who is a professor at Pyongyang Sungsil College (平壤崇實專門敎授), has published a poetry collection titled "Chosŏn's Pulse" (朝鮮의 脈博), and An Sŏ Kim Ŏk (岸曙 金億) is also said to be releasing new works. This year seems to hold portents of a great revival in the poetry scene.

Changes Among Female Literary Figures

Song Kyewŏl (宋桂月), who always showed reliable works with her forceful writing style (억세인 필치), is ill and has gone to her hometown by the Sinch'ang (新昌) coast, overgrown with white sands and green pines. Yi Kyŏngwŏn (李敬媛) has also gone far away to the North Country (北國). Is the female literary scene destined to become desolate once again? <16>

**Summary**

This article from May 1932 provides gossip and updates from the Korean literary scene (文壇雜話). It notes the perceived lack of significant achievement among writers educated in the United States, contrasting this with hopeful signs in the poetry world, highlighting new publications by Yi Ŭnsang and Yang Chudong. It also mentions novelist Ch'oe Tokkyŏn's brief detention and interrogation by police after returning from his hometown, and laments the departure of two prominent female writers, Song Kyewŏl and Yi Kyŏngwŏn, from the literary scene due to illness and relocation. For historians, the article offers insights into the colonial-era literary community's dynamics, including perceptions of Western influence (specifically American education), the everyday reality of surveillance and potential police harassment (Ch'oe Tokkyŏn's 'unexpected misfortune'), and the precarious position of women writers. The commentary on US-educated writers might reflect underlying sentiments about cultural influence or the relevance of foreign degrees to the Korean context at the time.

文壇雜話
亞米利加系의 不振

米國서 무슨 文學士이니 무슨 哲學士이니 하고 당당?하게 학위를 엇고 도라온 문사치고 천재적 활약을 보여준 이는 한 분도 업다. 창작가 秋湖 田榮澤씨는 米國 무슨 대학을 마치고 오더니 황해도 어느 시골 교회의 목사님으로 一切不鳴하고 시인 金與濟씨 五山高普 학감을 그만 두고 난 뒤 亦 일세를 울닐만한 대작을 발표한 일이 업고 시인 吳天錫씨 亦 寂寂無聞이다. 其外 諸氏에 至하여는 寧欲不及言, 오직 이 사이에서 朱耀燮씨가 문예오락론이나마 이색잇는 論陣을 펴고 잇다할가?
미국계 문사의 부진하는 이유가 어대에 잇슬가. 태평양 물결이 센 까닭일가!

獨鵑氏의 橫厄

소설가 崔獨鵑씨 고향인 黃海道 載寧에 갓다 왓더니 경찰서로부터 호출을 밧어 하로를 취조 밧고 무사히 나왓다. 氏는 이 횡액에 苦笑. 「亂影」 속편을 이 기괴한 하로 시이에 구상하엿다면 도로혀 橫財格이 되련만.

詩壇大振의 前兆

시조작가 李殷相씨가 梨花女子專門을 사직하고 나와서 곳 시조집을 上梓 간행하엿다. 氏의 시조는 이미 거장의 稱이 잇는 터이라 문단에서 매우 중요하게 평가될 것이요. 또 한 가지는 平壤崇實專門敎授로 잇는 梁柱東씨가 「朝鮮의 脈博」이란 시집을 간행하엿고 岸曙 金億씨도 신작을 公하리라든가 금년은 詩壇大振의 兆인 듯.

女流文士의 轉變

억세인 필치로 늘 미덤즉한 작품을 보여주든 宋桂月씨는 病을 안고 白沙靑松이 욱어진 고향인 新昌해변에 가 잇고 李敬媛씨 또한 멀니 北國으로 내려갓다. 여류문단은 또 다시 적막하렴인가. <16>
