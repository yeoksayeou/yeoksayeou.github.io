The Pounding Mill is also Delightful
						Yun Kŭk-yŏng

The watermill goes up and down, mountain and water go *k'ungdŏkk'ung*
On the softly thawed fields, whose laughter is it?
Red skirts and blue skirts have bloomed beside the well
Let's pick flowers, carry them on our heads, and go to the mountain
Ehēra! It's a bountiful year (豐年)! The pounding mill is also delightful!

The watermill goes up and down, moon and stars go *k'ungdŏkk'ung*
On the flowing water, whose laughter is it?
Red skirts and blue skirts have bloomed on the sandy field
Let's pick flowers, carry them on our heads, and go to the forest
Ehēra! It's a bountiful year (豐年)! The pounding mill is also delightful!<85>

**Summary**

This short poem by Yun Kŭk-yŏng paints a vivid and joyous picture of Korean rural life centered around the rhythmic sound of a watermill. It contrasts the mechanical "k'ungdŏkk'ung" sound with natural elements (mountains, water, moon, stars) and human activity (laughter, women in colourful skirts gathering flowers). The poem celebrates a sense of community, harmony with nature, and abundance, explicitly mentioning a "bountiful year" (豐年). From a historical perspective, published in 1936 during the Japanese colonial period, the poem's focus on traditional rural aesthetics, communal joy, and prosperity is noteworthy. Historians might find interest in its seemingly idyllic portrayal as potentially representing an escapist sentiment, a subtle affirmation of Korean cultural identity amidst colonial pressures, or even a reflection of specific state-promoted ideals of agrarian life, depending on the broader context of the author and publication.
