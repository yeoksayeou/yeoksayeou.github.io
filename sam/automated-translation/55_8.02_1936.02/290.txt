Sixty Won Lost by Mun Ye-bong

This happened last winter when the popular actress of the time, Ms. Mun Ye-bong (文藝峯女士), was busy going back and forth to the studio, diligently filming "Ch'unhyangjŏn" (春香傳) and "Ch'unp'ung" (春風). As her family was poor, she always took advance payments (假拂) of 5 Won or 10 Won, saying she needed to buy rice and firewood (쌀나무).

One day, while filming "Ch'unp'ung" (春風撮影), Ms. Mun's face (얼골) suddenly turned deathly pale (샛파라케 질니며), and she looked as if she was about to cry. The director (監督) and cameraman were surprised and asked her the reason.

She said, "I had secretly hidden (秘藏) 60 Won, money I had gathered by asking for 5 Won and 3 Won until now, in a pocket inside my skirt where no one would know, but while running here and there during location shooting (모케-슌), it must have fallen out somewhere; it's gone (업서젓다)."

Considering her difficult household situation (살님), her determination (決心) to save up to 60 Won by taking 3 Won here and 3 Won there was quite remarkable, and the devil's (惡魔) crime (罪) that caused her to lose such hard-earned 60 Won, born of blood and tears, must also be considered great.<138>

**Summary**

This short anecdote recounts an incident where the popular Korean actress Mun Ye-bong lost 60 Won she had painstakingly saved from small advance payments while filming on location. The money, hidden in her skirt pocket, was lost during the physical activity of shooting scenes for the film "Ch'unp'ung". The article emphasizes her poverty and the significant emotional and financial blow the loss represented. From a historical perspective, the article offers a glimpse into the financial struggles of even popular entertainers during the colonial period, the system of advance payments in the film industry, and the value of money (60 Won being a substantial sum arduously saved). It also reveals details about film production practices, like location shooting ("moke-shyun").
