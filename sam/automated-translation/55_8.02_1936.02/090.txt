Regarding Tan'gun and Mr. Song Chin-u's Theory

One day in the office of the Dong-A Ilbo president, when Principal Kim Yong-mu (金用茂) of Posŏng College (普專) visited, Song Chin-u (宋鎭禹), holding his brush, intentionally took out an old, dusty, yellow-paged book (황지책) and said,
"The 'Tan' (檀) character in Tan'gun (檀君) is clearly the character 'Tan' (壇), but Yuk-tang (六堂) mistakenly started using the character 'Tan' (檀)..."
Pointing out passages from the writings of a great scholar (鴻儒) named Yang Sŏng-ji (梁誠之) from Namwŏn from long ago (녯날), he engaged in a passionate discussion for a long time. According to Mr. Song Chin-u's words (말슴), the politician Yang Sŏng-ji, who held the rank of T'ongjŏng Taebu (通政大夫), had already argued 400 years ago that Tan'gun (壇君) - should be venerated.<55>

**Summary**

This short piece recounts an anecdote where Song Chin-u, president of the Dong-A Ilbo, discusses the correct Hanja character for Tan'gun, the mythical founder of Korea, with Kim Yong-mu, the principal of Posŏng College. Song argues, referencing the 15th-century scholar Yang Sŏng-ji, that the character should be 壇 (altar) rather than the commonly used 檀 (sandalwood), attributing the latter usage mistakenly to the intellectual Ch'oe Nam-sŏn (Yuk-tang). Song emphasizes that Yang Sŏng-ji had advocated for venerating Tan'gun centuries prior. From a historical perspective, this article is interesting as it shows prominent Korean figures during the colonial period actively debating foundational national myths and historical orthography. It highlights the intellectual effort to solidify Korean identity by referencing pre-colonial scholarship (Yang Sŏng-ji) and engaging with contemporary interpretations (Ch'oe Nam-sŏn/Yuk-tang), demonstrating the continued relevance of Tan'gun as a symbol even under Japanese rule.
