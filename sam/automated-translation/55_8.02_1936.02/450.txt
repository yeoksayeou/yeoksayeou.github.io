男壯美
						爲堂 鄭寅普

Fierce as a tiger, yet light as a butterfly,
Like the elders of old who could swim fifty *li*,
If that flower is about to bloom, what does it matter if one seems mad?

Is not my fist iron? Your forearm is an arrow quiver (箭筒).
The blood circulating through the whole body seems to make mountains, rivers, grass, and trees resound.
Lined up in the great courtyard, there is nothing to fear.<236>

Those guests who came from afar for the sake of the young gentlemen,
The children once on their knees have come here and become strong men.
Turn the championship flag this way; I will see them as my sons.

Whoever lost, whoever won, after running, they are comrades.
Where did the competitive spirit go? Without distinction, a shared laugh.
Soon, even the drumbeat prompts them to compete again.

The pines that grew straight are deep as the sea,
The courtyard opened in the center is refreshingly wide.
This is where heroes ran; let us hold it in high esteem.<237>

**Summary**

This poem by Chŏng Inbo celebrates the vibrant physical strength and competitive spirit of young Korean men, likely observed at an athletic event. Using metaphors of tigers, butterflies, legendary swimmers, and warriors, it portrays their power, agility, and camaraderie. The poem evokes a sense of collective pride and hope, seeing these youths as the strong future ("sons") and the venue as a hallowed ground ("where heroes ran"). For historians, the poem is interesting as it reflects the emphasis on physical culture and the underlying nationalist sentiment during the Japanese colonial period. The celebration of Korean masculine vigor ("Namjangmi") and heroic potential, penned by a prominent nationalist intellectual, can be interpreted as a subtle assertion of national vitality and spirit in a time of oppression.

男壯美
						爲堂 鄭寅普
범같이 사나운 채 나비같이 가벼워라
五十里 헤염치든 옛날어룬 저럴 것이
저 꽃이 붕트랴 하니 미첫단들 어떠리

내 주먹 쇠 아닌가 자네 팔뚝 전동(箭筒)이외
온 몸에 도는 피가 山川草木 울리올 듯
큰 뜰에 열지어 서니 두려울 것 없어라<236>

자제님 양보랴고 멀리 오신 저 손님네
무룹 위 스라손이 예와서는 장사라오
優勝旗 이리 돌리라 아들뉘로 보리라

뉘젓 건 뉘이겻 건 뛰고 나니 동무로다
승벽은 어대가고 너나 없이 한 우슴을
이윽고 북소리마저 서로 다시 겨눠라

제대로 자란 솔이 바다같이 깊었는대
복판에 열린 마당 시원이도 넓은지고
英雄들 뛰든 곳이라 지체 높게 하옵소<237>
<236-237>
