十一月旬翌答林偶丁來詩
梧村 薛泰熙

乍雪因晴冷滿天, 冬來寒度未看前.
重戶蟄居加攝護, 故人消息亦云然.
曾說所懷無一隔, 每綠同病卽相憐.
依床閉目思何事, ?賴端箋識兩邊.

(Poem in Reply to Im Ujŏng, Sent the Day After the Middle Ten Days of the Eleventh Month)
By Och’on Sŏl T’aehŭi

A sudden snow, then clear skies; cold fills the heavens,
Winter arrives, a coldness unseen before.
Behind double doors, I hibernate, taking extra care,
News from old friends is also thus [scarce].
We once spoke our minds without any barriers,
Always, those sharing the same illness pity each other.
Leaning on the bed, eyes closed, what do I ponder?
Relying on your fine letter, knowing both our situations.

一書相報起居安, 衰?堪嗟歲色?.
世毛足無傾隻耳, 隣樵應是恥危冠.
詩因境好能飄逸, 病畏風傷更?寒.
別業爲君恐或可, 何庸城市未忘看.

One letter reports back that you are well,
But sighing at decline, the year's aspect [is grim].
Worldly trifles are not worth bending a single ear to,
Neighboring woodcutters likely feel shame at [my] precarious hat [official position/status].
Poetry, finding a good setting, can soar freely,
Illness fears the wind's harm, dreading the cold even more.
A villa in the countryside might perhaps suit you,
Why linger, unable to forget the city?

冬至
(Winter Solstice)

至今北陸盡天涯, 從此南爲日有華.
稔識履長雙襪獻, 應將添繡一絲斜.
放梅尙要溫山?, 舒柳終期綠萬家.
閉目生生非別道, 落花那裡復開花.

Until now, the northern lands stretched to the horizon,
Henceforth, the southern sun gains its brilliance.
Well aware of the lengthening days, I offer padded socks,
It seems fitting to add a single slanted thread of embroidery [for the lengthening daylight].
To release the plum blossoms still requires a warm mountain[?],
To unfurl the willows ultimately promises green to myriad homes.
Eyes closed, life arises – there is no separate way;
Where the fallen flower lies, there it blooms again.

臘月旬三林偶丁來訪相酬
(Replying to Im Ujŏng’s Visit on the Thirteenth of the Twelfth Lunar Month)

陽長己是得天時, 信識窮廬日漸遲.
Yang energy lengthens, already gaining Heaven’s time,
Truly, in my humble hut, the days grow longer.
The willow’s slumber begins to break from now,
The plum blossom’s tidings, who knows when they’ll arrive?
Thinking of our homeland together is not without meaning,
Most joyous is today’s meeting, unexpected.
Forcibly enduring the many regrets within my breast,
I wish to let my dwelling be as it may.<74>

偶成寄梧村
偶丁
(Composed Impromptu and Sent to Och’on)
By Ujŏng

郭門一出脫長安, 獨臥空山歲月蘭.
Leaving the city gate, I escape Ch’ang-an (the capital),
Alone I lie in empty mountains, the months and years [fragrant like] orchids.
Unheard by the world in these deep alleys,
Sick for years, I neglect my clothes and cap [appearance/formalities].
Bringing back the color of crows, the lonely village evening,
Containing the fading bell sounds, the old temple’s cold.
The old greenery of Samgak Mountain is not yet gone,
Morning and evening, I face it and watch.

訪梧村
(Visiting Och’on)

未識天寒了幾時, 宿?相伴此遲遲.
I know not how long this cold weather will last,
With lingering illness as my companion, here I tarry.
The heart, unattached to anything, finds freedom in idleness,
That we share the same affliction is known in old age.
Why should this meeting not make a full day?
This year, I fear, few chances remain.
The setting sun falls, three cups of wine,
Allow my life to be as it will.

忍耐
尹益善
(Endurance)
By Yun Ik-sŏn

願得衆生濟度術 飢無求飽寒苦無
大悲弘誓做心丹 辱不起 瞋讚不歡

Wishing to attain the art of saving all sentient beings,
Neither seeking fullness when hungry nor [lamenting] lack when cold and suffering.
Great compassion and vast vows become the heart’s elixir,
Insult does not provoke anger, praise brings no joy.

險若泰山平地踏 頭戴廣長安忍甲
狗如牢獄樂天觀 추箭妄弓破亦難

Though dangers are like Mount T’ai, tread them as level ground,
Wear the broad and long armor of patient endurance on your head.
View confinement like a kennel as heavenly joy,
Then the arrows of delusion from the bow of falsehood are hard to pierce.

精進
(Diligence)

萬事成功總在吾 川流不息能穿石
勤行積極有歸趨 海?無停必返珠

The success of all things lies entirely within oneself,
A river flowing without cease can bore through stone.
Diligent practice and active effort have their destination,
An untiring oyster will surely yield a pearl.

利箭難穿堅固鎧 自强直至光明處
眞金多出鍊精爐 障碍山崩通大途

Sharp arrows cannot pierce strong armor,
Strengthen yourself until you reach the place of light.
True gold mostly comes from the refining furnace,
Mountains of obstacles crumble, opening the great path.

操行
(Conduct)

靜觀宋宙道源長 百歲流芳誠所到
生滅人間換古今 一時淫樂禍相尋

Quietly observe the universe, the source of the Way is long,
A hundred years of fragrance flow where sincerity reaches.
Birth and death among humans replace old and new,
Momentary indulgence and pleasure invite disaster.

處身必向神明眼 於地於天眞不愧
臨事無欺大衆心 若斯然後有餘陰<75>
(Conducting oneself, surely face the eyes of the spirits,)
(Towards earth and heaven, truly have no shame.)
(Facing matters, do not deceive the hearts of the multitude,)
(Only if thus, will there be leftover grace [blessings for descendants].)<75>

**Summary**

This section features an exchange of classical Chinese poems between Sŏl T’aehŭi (Och'on) and Im Ujŏng (Ujŏng) during the winter of 1935-1936, along with poems by Yun Ik-sŏn. Sŏl and Im discuss their shared experiences of illness, seclusion from society (contrasting rural quietude with the city), the comfort of friendship, and observations on the changing seasons (winter solstice, approaching spring). Yun Ik-sŏn's poems focus on Buddhist virtues: endurance (忍耐) in hardship, diligence (精進) in self-cultivation, and proper moral conduct (操行). The poems collectively reflect themes of resignation, perseverance, friendship, and spiritual/moral reflection among Korean intellectuals of the period.

For historians, this article illustrates the continued vitality of traditional Sino-Korean literary forms (Hansi) among educated Koreans during Japanese colonial rule. The themes of withdrawal, illness, and endurance, while personal, might subtly reflect the psychological landscape of intellectuals living under oppressive conditions, finding solace in nature, friendship, and philosophical or religious contemplation rather than overt political engagement. Yun Ik-sŏn's Buddhist poems point to the role of religion in providing ethical frameworks and coping mechanisms during this era.
