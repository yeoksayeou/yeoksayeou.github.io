When the literary figures Ch'oe Sŭng-il (崔承一), Yi Sŏ-gu (李瑞求), and a few others first went to Tōkyō (東京), they entered a Western-style restaurant (洋料理집) somewhere on the Ginza-dōri (銀座通). Thinking they should try some rare Western cuisine (稀貴한 洋料理) while they were there, they flipped through the "menu-" (「메뉴-」) and found something called "asparagus" (「아스바라까스」). The name sounded so bizarre (怪奇하여) that they ordered it (請햇더니). When it was brought out (가저온 것을 보니), on a large plate were placed two slender stalks, like "green onions" (파), resembling a single grain of millet (一粒粟) in the Han River (漢江). After paying 80 *sen* (80錢) for just this, they felt it was so unfair (억울하고) and unsatisfying (싱거워) that even now, whenever they see food involving "asparagus," they burst into belly laughter (抱腹하고 웃는다든가).<137>

**Summary**

This short anecdote recounts the amusing experience of several Korean literary figures, including Ch'oe Sŭng-il and Yi Sŏ-gu, trying asparagus for the first time in a Western restaurant on Tokyo's Ginza street. Finding the name strange, they ordered it, only to be presented with two thin stalks for the price of 80 *sen*, which they found utterly underwhelming and laughable. From a historical perspective, the story subtly highlights the cultural encounters and economic realities faced by Koreans during the colonial period, particularly the novelty and expense of Western culture (represented by the restaurant and food) experienced by Korean intellectuals visiting Japan, the colonial center. The feeling of being ripped off for an unfamiliar, meager dish could reflect broader colonial dynamics or simply a humorous clash of culinary expectations.
