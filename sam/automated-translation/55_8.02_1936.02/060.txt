Article Title: 曺晩植氏의 民曆日記 (Mr. Cho Man-sik's Folk Almanac Diary)
Author: Not specified
Article Type: 잡저 (Miscellaneous Writing)

Known for wearing a *turumaegi* that comes down to his shins like a Korean frock-coat, and for writing letters in the old style on yellow paper (黃紙) or white paper (白紙), Mr. Cho Man-sik is certainly rich in strange incidents and anecdotes (奇事逸蹟). However, let me introduce one more hidden story: although he occasionally writes a journal (日誌), he doesn't have a separate diary book. Instead, he buys a 10-*jŏn* Korean folk almanac (朝鮮民曆) and meticulously writes down the daily occurrences and all sorts of worldly affairs (世事百態) like tiny seeds in the date columns. And he treasures this folk almanac (民曆) so much that it's said he almost never puts it down, whether walking, staying, sitting, or lying down (行住座臥).<50>

**Summary**

This short piece describes a peculiar habit of Cho Man-sik: instead of using a conventional diary, he records daily events and observations ("all sorts of worldly affairs") in tiny script within the date columns of a cheap, 10-jeon Korean folk almanac (民曆). He reportedly values this almanac greatly, keeping it constantly with him. From a historical perspective, this anecdote offers a glimpse into the personal life and character of Cho Man-sik, a prominent nationalist figure, highlighting his frugality and perhaps a blend of traditionalism (using an almanac, older writing materials mentioned) with a modern practice (keeping a detailed daily journal of contemporary events). Historians might find interest in this portrayal of his simple lifestyle and dedication to recording the times, even in humble ways, during the colonial period.
