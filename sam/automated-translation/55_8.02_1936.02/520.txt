**Body Text Translation:**
<1> Dear readership!
<2> The Esperantist groups supported by the press in Korea are few.
<3> And especially our magazine Samch'ŏlli had the first Esperanto section during the last two years.
<4> But, alas, it ceased from last April.
<5> Now I, a contributor to the magazine, will again begin a regular course in it from this issue.
<6> I hope that it will be continued for a long time.
<7> Do you know that the best ideal for humanity is the internal idea of Esperanto?
<8> To realize peace for the whole world, we must become brothers through one language.
<9> Therefore, this language must be neutral.
<10> Esperanto is precisely that language.
<11> Let's learn Esperanto!
<12> Let's correspond with worldwide brothers and sisters through it!

**Summary**

This short article announces the revival of the Esperanto column in the magazine *Samch'ŏlli*. The author, a contributor, notes the scarcity of press support for Esperanto groups in Korea and expresses hope that the resumed column, which previously ran for two years before stopping, will continue long-term. The piece passionately promotes Esperanto's "internal idea" as an ideal for humanity, arguing that a neutral international language like Esperanto is necessary to foster global brotherhood and achieve world peace, urging readers to learn it and engage in international correspondence. From a historical perspective, the presence and promotion of Esperanto in a mainstream Korean magazine during the Japanese colonial period is noteworthy. It reflects an engagement with internationalist movements and ideals, offering a potential avenue for global connection independent of the colonial power structure and hinting at aspirations for universal fraternity and peace, potentially serving as a subtle counter-narrative to imperial ideologies.
