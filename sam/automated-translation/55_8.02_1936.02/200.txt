I Don't Know
						Yun Kŭg-yŏng

On the sandy bank by the river
You are green leaves, I am red flowers
The wind rustles, enveloping my bosom
Should I laugh or should I cry? I don't know

On the ferry boat on a moonlit night
You are the boatman, I am the seagull
The water coming and going brushes my flesh
Should I laugh or should I cry? I don't know<96>

**Summary**

This short poem by Yun Kŭg-yŏng expresses a feeling of ambiguity and uncertainty through simple nature imagery. In two stanzas, the speaker contrasts "you" and "I" using metaphors (leaves/flower, boatman/seagull) in specific settings (riverbank, ferry boat). The recurring refrain, "Should I laugh or should I cry? I don't know," highlights an unresolved emotional state brought on by external stimuli (wind, water). For historians, the poem offers a glimpse into the lyrical sensibilities of the era. Its focus on personal feelings and nature, rather than overt political themes, might reflect a common artistic response during the restrictive colonial period, perhaps representing a subtle form of introspection or escapism amidst the broader societal context.

나는 몰나요
						尹克榮
江가에 모래밧에
당신은 푸른닙 나는야 붉은 꼿
바람살 슬렁슬렁 품에 감도니
우스릿가 울닛가 나는 몰나요

달밤에 나룻배에
당신은 뱃사공 나는야 갈매기
들고나는 저 물이 살을 스치니
우스릿가 울닛가 나는 몰나요<96>
