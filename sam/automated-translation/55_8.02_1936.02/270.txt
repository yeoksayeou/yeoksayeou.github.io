The Record Player and Ms. Pak Hwasŏng (朴花城 女士)

When Ms. Pak Hwasŏng (朴花城女士) went to Yongjŏng (龍井) in Kando (間島), the female teachers' group (女先生團) of Myŏngsin Girls' High School (明信女高) there, along with Ms. Kang Kyŏngae (姜敬愛女士), invited this honored guest from afar (遠路貴賓) and treated her well with local cuisine (胡地料理) mixed with pig sundae. At that time, they happened to put on a record. The ones sitting next to the record player coincidentally were Ms. Pak and Ms. Kang.

Yi Tongbaek's (李東伯) voice singing "Chukchangmanghye tanp'oja ro" [Bamboo staff and straw shoes, simple attire] soared well for a while like a seagull in the clouds, and then the record (盤) finished playing. It needed to be stopped.

"Ms. Pak, please stop that."
A female teacher sitting far away requested, but Ms. Pak replied,
"Oh my, this is my first time with a gramophone."
And she stepped back hastily as if avoiding a tiger. When Ms. Kang Kyŏngae was asked, it was also the same situation (亦 마천가지).

Through this evening's event, it became clear (判明) how lacking in common knowledge (常識) about the "record player" these two renowned female literary figures (女流文士) were.<136>

**Summary**

The article recounts an anecdote where two prominent female writers, Pak Hwasŏng and Kang Kyŏngae, visiting Yongjŏng in Kando, were hosted by local female teachers. When asked to stop a record player after a performance by Yi Tongbaek finished, both women admitted their unfamiliarity with the device, revealing their lack of experience with this technology. For historians, this brief piece offers a glimpse into the social interactions among female intellectuals in colonial Korea, their travel to regions like Kando, and the uneven diffusion of Western technology like the gramophone, even among the educated urban elite. It also notes the type of Korean music (Yi Tongbaek's *p'ansori*) enjoyed during such gatherings.
