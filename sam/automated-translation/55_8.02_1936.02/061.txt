The article titled "Where Did Min Yŏnghwi (閔泳徽)'s Twelve Million Won Go?" will be published in the upcoming March issue due to page constraints.<50>

**Summary**

This is a brief notice from the editors of Samch'ŏlli magazine informing readers that an article titled "Where Did Min Yŏnghwi's Twelve Million Won Go?" has been postponed from the February 1936 issue to the March issue due to space limitations. The notice points to editorial decisions dictated by practical constraints like page count. For historians, the title of the postponed article itself is interesting, referencing Min Yŏnghwi, a prominent figure from the late Joseon and colonial period, and a very large sum of money (twelve million Won), potentially hinting at articles exploring wealth, legacies, or perhaps controversies surrounding such figures during that era.
