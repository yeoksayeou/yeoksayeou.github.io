The People's Earnest Desire
						Hoshino Tadayū, Propaganda Department, National Service Korea League

The common earnest desire of our people today is to hasten the resolution of the China Incident and the establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

There are no exclusive hidden thoughts or selfish conspiracies whatsoever in this. From the perspective of those who view our country's actions with an impartial and fair heart, they should not direct a single point of criticism towards our country, but rather should strive to support our country so that its earnest desire may be achieved even one day sooner. And yet, nations such as Great Britain and the United States dare to meddle in the affairs of East Asia, obstruct our country's advance, and hinder our country's earnest desire. This is because they observe our country's actions with a viewpoint derived from their own wicked thoughts and ambitions, perhaps thinking it harmful to the achievement of their own ambitions. Our country treads the path of righteousness and has nothing to fear; we must simply push forward. It is they themselves who should reflect and repent.

If there is a seed that disturbs the peace of the Pacific in the Pacific problem, it is, without question, the ambitions and prejudices of the nations of Great Britain and the United States. It is their wicked thought to forcibly prevent the restoration of peace in China and to monopolize and occupy the prosperity and welfare of the nations of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

It is their tyranny that seeks to darken the future of our country, which has struggled, raising its national strength, with the peace of the world, and especially the peace of East Asia, as its earnest desire. If they would only once become open-minded, face the situation squarely, and wish for the welfare of the East Asian peoples, they should suddenly realize the error of their past ways and change their policies. To resort to armed conflict before reaching that point is too roundabout and too wasteful. It is the height of stupidity that these nations, such as Great Britain and the United States, who are inherently clever, skilled in calculating profit and loss, and who preach peace and humanity like a habit, do not know whether applying military pressure to our country will truly achieve what they desire.

However, if their utterly foolish actions continue to allow the cause of misfortune to grow, without even a re-recognition of East Asia based on our country's truth and sincerity, then that too cannot be helped. It goes without saying that our country must faithfully advance towards its beliefs and charge forward to the complete fulfillment of the people's earnest desire. The resolve of our people is already fixed and shines brightly. Now, even if a hundred thunderbolts were to fall at our feet, we should not be alarmed in the slightest, but calmly walk our path forward. It is probably difficult to hope that the various nations will reflect <88> and repent. For us as a people, it is unacceptable to neglect preparations or relax our vigilance, counting on such a remote possibility. As the new Prime Minister Tōjō swore to the people as head of the cabinet in the government statement at 7 p.m. on October 18th, "The path to breaking through the current difficulties lies, under His Majesty's august virtue, solely in iron will and swift, precise execution." The one hundred million people must also place rock-solid trust in the swift and resolute actions based on this new premier's iron conviction, and no matter what situation unfolds, they must solidify their iron unity and push forward to overcome the crisis.

Universal conscription is the great principle upon which our nation was founded. However, it is something the entire populace has long been well aware of that even those who, through certain processes, cannot become soldiers should still resolve to serve on the home front with the spirit of a soldier. Especially, the several million eligible workers on the peninsula, burning with supreme patriotism, should rise up fiercely at this time. Recently, the term "universal labor" has become popular, and this too should be deeply appreciated and embodied as the mindset of the entire populace in wartime. There should not be a single idle person among the people; all should dedicate themselves to matters useful to the state with the mindset of a worker. If the entire nation becomes one and confronts matters with a spirit like iron and fire, what in the world is there to fear? So-called "universal labor" is not just a rhetorical slogan. Even the old, young, sick, and weak must at least grasp its spirit and translate into action, without forgetting for a moment, doing their utmost according to their capacity.

**Summary**

This editorial, written shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor and the appointment of Prime Minister Tōjō Hideki, argues passionately for Japan's mission to establish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and resolve the "China Incident." It portrays Japan's actions as righteous and driven by a desire for peace in East Asia, while condemning Britain and the United States as selfish, ambitious powers hindering Japan's noble goals through prejudice and meddling. The author calls for unwavering national unity, resolve ("iron will"), and total mobilization ("universal conscription," "universal labor") under the new leadership, urging the populace, explicitly including Koreans ("several million eligible workers on the peninsula"), to dedicate themselves fully to the war effort without fear or hesitation. Historians would find this article valuable as a clear example of Japanese wartime propaganda disseminated in colonial Korea, justifying aggression, demonizing the Allies, and promoting the total mobilization of the Japanese empire, including its colonial subjects, under slogans like "universal labor." The specific call to action for Koreans highlights the increasing demands placed upon them as the war expanded.

國民の念願
						國民總力朝鮮聯盟 宣傳部 星野忠勇
今日我國民共同の念願は支那事變の處理と東亞共榮圈の確立を急ぐことである。
其間に何等排他的の雜念もなく利己的の陰謀もない。至公至平の心を以つて我國の行動を見る者からすれば、我國に對して一點の非難を加ふることなく、寧ろ我國を支援して其念願を一日も早やく達せしむことと努むることである。而も英米等の諸國は敢て東亞の事に容喙して我國の前進を阻み、我國の念願を妨げるのは、却て彼等自身の邪念と野心とから割り出したる見方を以て我國の行動を觀察しそれが或は彼等自身の野望の達成に害あることを思ふか爲めである。我國は正を履んで恐るゝ所なく、只邁進すべきのみであり、反省し改悔すべきは彼等自身である。
×  ×
太平洋の問題に太平洋の平和を攪亂する種ありとすれば、それは問ふまでもなく英米諸國の野望であり、偏見である。强て支那の平和恢復を妨げんとし、東亞共榮圈諸國の利福を壟斷し占有せんとする彼等の邪念である。
世界の平和、殊の東亞の平和を念として國力を擧げて奮鬪せる我國の前途を暗くせんとする彼等の橫暴である。彼等にして一旦虛心坦懷、事態を正視し東亞民族の福祉を願念するに於ては、飜然從米の非を悟りて其の政策を轉換すべきである。兵火に訴へて然る後とゝに至るは餘りに迂遠であり、餘りに浪費過ぎる。元々聰明にして利害の打算に長け、且つ癖のやうに平和人道を唱ふる英米等これらの諸國が、武力を持つて我國に威壓を加へて果して彼等の思ふ壺にはまるかを知らざるは愚鈍の至りである。
×  ×
しかし、彼等の愚鈍極まる行動も、我國の眞實と誠意籠る、東亞への再認識はおろか、依然として禍因の增大に任すとすれば之も亦致し方ない。我國としては飽迄もその所信に向つて忠實に、國民的念願の完遂に突進すべきは言を俟たない。我國民の覺悟は旣に定まつて炳乎としてゐる。今更百雷足下に落つるも何等驚く所なく泰然として其進路を步むべきである。諸國が反省＜88＞し改悔するは恐らくは望み難い。其萬一をあてにして準備を怠り覺り弛うするが如きは我國民として有る可からざる所である。東條新首相が、内閣首班として、國民に誓つた十月十八日午後七時の政府聲明にも『時艱突破の途は御稜威の下、たゞ鐵石の意志と迅速的確なる實行にあり』と云はれて居る。一億國民も、この新宰相の鐵石の信念に基く迅速果敢なる行動に磐石の信賴を置き、いかなる事態が展開されやうとも、鐵石の團結を固めて難局の打開に邁進すべである。
×  ×
國民皆兵は我國立國の大主義である。しかし或る過程において兵たるを得ざる者もなほ兵たる心持を以て銃後奉公を期すべきは國民全體の夙に熟知せる所である。殊に愛國の至情に燃え立つた、半島幾百萬の勤勞適格者は、此の際猛然と振ひ立つべきである。最近國民皆勞の語が流行するも、是亦戰時下に於ける國民全體の心かけとして大に翫味し且體得すべき所である。國民中一人の遊休者なく、全部が勤勞者たる心持を以て國家有用の事に盡すべきである。全國民一丸となつて鐵火の如き精神を以て事に當るとすれば、天下何ものか恐るべき者あらん。所謂國民皆勞は只の美辭的標語ではない。老幼病弱者といへども少くとも其精神を感得して其分に應じて最善を盡すことを寸時も忘れず行動に移して行かねばならないのである。
