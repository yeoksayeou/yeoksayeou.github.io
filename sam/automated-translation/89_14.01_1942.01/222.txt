Famous Person's Words: Mascot of Health
						Writer Hayashi Fumiko

I have never really taken much medicine (藥) before. Yet, for some reason, I have been fond of using only "Wakamoto" (와까모도) for the past two or three years. It started when my mother always kept it on the dining table (食卓), so I tried it wondering what it was. Even if I eat a lot of food (飮食), I don't get an upset stomach, and it happened to be during the midsummer Dog Days (三伏間); because I habitually took "Wakamoto" after meals (食事), I passed the time quite safely (無事). Perhaps (或) you might think this is like some kind of advertisement (廣告), but everyone in my family (家族) takes it after meals (食後) without fail. Firstly, it has no side effects (副作用), and since there is absolutely (絶對) no constipation (便秘), I think it is especially excellent for women (女子). My mother is now seventy-one (七十一歲), but perhaps because she takes "Wakamoto," she eats so much every day (每日) that I feel like she overeats; every time she has a meal, she says, "I ate deliciously," and always eats exactly three bowls.<119>

**Summary**

This short piece by Japanese writer Hayashi Fumiko is a personal endorsement of the digestive aid "Wakamoto." Published in the Korean magazine *Samch'ŏlli* in 1942, she describes how her family, including her elderly mother, regularly uses the product after meals, praising its effectiveness in preventing indigestion and constipation without side effects. For historians, this article is interesting as it reflects the promotion and consumption of Japanese commercial products (Wakamoto) in colonial Korea, showing a facet of cultural and economic integration during the late colonial period. It also provides a small window into everyday health concerns and remedies common at the time.

名士의 말 健康의 마스코-트
						作家 林 芙美子
나는 지금까지 藥이라는 것을 그다지많이 먹어본일이 없습니다. 그러면서도 웬일인지 『와까모도』만은 二三年前부터 愛用하고 있습니다. 우리어머니가 늘食卓위에 놓와둠으로 어떤것인가요 먹어본 것이 始初입니다만 飮食을 많이먹어도 배탈이나는 일이없고, 때마침 안여름 三伏間이였읍니다만 食事뒤에 習慣的으로 『와까모도』를 먹기 때문에 퍽 無事하게 지냈습니다. 或, 무슨 廣告가치 생각할지 모르겠읍니다만 우리 家族들은 누구나때놓지않고 모다 食後에는 服用합니다. 첫째 副作用이없고 便秘는 絶對로 없으니까 女子들께는 더욱 훌륭한것이라고 생각합니다. 저의어머니는 지금 일흔하나(七十一歲)입니다만 『와까모도』를 服用하시는 때문인지 너무 잡수신다고 느끼리만치 每日 食事하실때마다 「맛있게 잡수셨다고」하시며 꼭꼭 세공기식드십니다.＜119＞
