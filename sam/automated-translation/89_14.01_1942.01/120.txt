The Recent Situation of Koreans in Nanjing
By Kinoshita Shisetsu

Our Peninsular people (半島人) who reside in this area, spurred by the recent Incident, have reached a number of 500. Although this number is far smaller than in large cities like Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, it is gratifying that all are working diligently. Looking back, Korea and Nanjing have not had much connection since ancient times. About 270 years ago, during the early Qing dynasty, when the Ming dynasty could barely hold on here in Nanjing under Qing pressure, Korea consistently disliked the Qing, sympathized with the Ming, maintained relations, and envoys traveled as far as Nanjing.
Some people, seeing that the number of Peninsular people in Nanjing is far smaller than in other cities, say that Nanjing lacks future potential for Peninsular people's development, but we oppose this view. We believe Nanjing is the most promising place for Peninsular people. Establishing a foothold in a certain place cannot be done in a short period of one or two years; it requires long years of labor and hardship, possibly more than ten years in the future. Places like Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, and Jinan are where the foundations for Peninsular people were firmly established twenty or thirty years ago, and considerable sacrifices were made. Compared to that, one must remember that the Peninsular people in Nanjing before and after the Incident are not of the same kind; they have come together in a completely mixed manner. From now on, we must work even harder; we must proactively build a foundation. Perhaps in ten years, tens of thousands of Peninsular compatriots will have established a considerable foothold. Why is Nanjing the most promising place for the future? Elsewhere, the ground has already been occupied by long-term residents, making it easy for those with a foothold to work but extremely difficult for newcomers to establish themselves. However, in Nanjing, most residents are newcomers, and there are not too many yet, so if one works actively, now is precisely the time. There is space, and there is plenty of work waiting for enterprising people. It is a golden opportunity that comes once in a thousand years. I want to encourage Peninsular compatriot entrepreneurs to inspect Nanjing. Seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times; if you look closely, there are countless promising businesses. <84>

The State of Koreans in Beijing
By Aoyama Bunsaku

(Beijing) Two and a half years have passed since I came to North China. However, having lived here and there, moving from place to place, rather than residing solely in Beijing, can I, with my shallow perspective, sufficiently convey the news of our Peninsular compatriots in North China through such a valuable publication? Yet, due to the editor's initial request and various circumstances making refusal difficult, I reluctantly take up my pen, despite this being an excessive burden for me. Listing the general circumstances of our compatriots in North China today is quite difficult. Therefore, I will focus on the circumstances common to Peninsular compatriots in Beijing. So, what is the state of commerce and industry in North China? This also lacks vitality and shows weakness, so the lives of us Peninsular people in North China can be described as extremely simple. First, let me describe the history of our compatriots residing in Beijing.
It is thought that Peninsular compatriots began residing in North China about thirty-three or thirty-four years ago, before the Republic of China. At that time, it is said there were only about ten people, primarily political dissidents or peddlers from abroad. Among these merchants were peddlers who brought Korean ginseng from Korea, sold it, bought up Chinese antiques, and took them back to the Peninsula. What should be particularly noted here is a town called Paozi Hutong (泡子胡同) within Suzhou Hutong (蘇州胡同) in the East City of Beijing. It is said that this is where a certain Yun Yŏng-bo (尹永保) employed Peninsular prostitutes and Chinese girls (中國姑娘) and opened a restaurant, marking the beginning of Peninsular people's business operations in Beijing.
Since then, the number of resident compatriots gradually increased, and around the first year of the Republic (1912), there were over ten Peninsular students studying abroad and some merchants. However, the majority were political dissidents from abroad, and the total number is said to have reached seventy-eight. For the following twenty years, the number of residents did not change significantly, but after the Manchurian Incident in Showa 8 (1933) and spurred by the current China Incident, a large number of compatriots flooded in. According to a survey by the Residents' Association (民會) on June 1st last year, their number far exceeded twenty thousand, showing astonishing figures (over 6,680 households). However, what is deeply concerning is that they lack stable occupations. Glancing at the commerce and industry sector, the main entities in Beijing are trading companies such as the solely existing tent manufacturing factory, Asahi Tent Limited Partnership Company (朝日テント合資會社), and the XX Mining Company (××鑛業會社) (unclear). In the cultural field, there are the Kaemyŏng Theater (開明戱院) managed by Mr. Song Paek-hŏn (宋百憲) and the Hwabuk Theater (華北戱院) operated by Mr. Ch'oe Pong-sŏ (崔鳳瑞), among others. Additionally, there seem to be quite a few active in some commercial areas. However, seventy to eighty percent of them are likely engaged in illicit businesses? This truly requires self-reflection from us, the Peninsular populace, without need for further words. Investing hundreds of thousands in opium (阿片) trading and earning tens of thousands of yen in profit daily may be profitable, but it must be decisively abandoned. Even if one starves to death, at this juncture, Peninsular compatriots must not drown in short-term gains for the sake of humanity. Or even if Peninsular compatriots gain hundreds of thousands of yen in profit, they must absolutely wash their hands of the opium business as soon as possible, even one day sooner. If we were to permanently engage in this illicit business, it is clearer than fire that the Chinese people will not interact with us Peninsular people with good feelings. <85>

Peninsular Compatriots in Mudanjiang
By Kim Sam-yŏl

(Mudanjiang) Mudanjiang City is located in the northeastern part of Manchukuo and is the provincial capital of Mudanjiang Province. Mudanjiang Province was newly established on July 1, Showa 12 (1937). The city was reorganized into a municipality on November 3, Showa 12 (1937), making it a newly emerging city. Mudanjiang City was entirely constructed after the founding of the nation based on strategic necessity.
At the time of the nation's founding, around Showa 7 (1932), it was merely a village with a population of only 4,500. However, ten years later today, it has achieved astonishing development, reaching a population of over 200,000 and ranking among the important cities in Manchukuo. Accompanying such development, our Peninsular compatriots residing near Mudanjiang City are also exerting their utmost efforts to make this astonishing development a microcosm of the advancing Manchukuo Empire. Below is a brief account introducing the news of the Peninsular people residing in Mudanjiang City.
Our Peninsular people account for about one-fourth of the total population of over 200,000, with the number of households reaching approximately 10,000. These people have increased since Showa 8 (1933), and about seventy percent reside in the southwestern part of the city, forming a complete Peninsular town where they live collectively. The remaining thirty percent are scattered throughout the city's various districts, and about twenty percent live in the city's suburban areas engaged in agriculture.
In essence, our Peninsular people are also part of the municipal auxiliary organs and a type of self-governing body. The West District is led by District Head Mr. Kang Ye-hwan (姜禮桓), who is also responsible for general administrative aspects.
In education, nine elementary schools (國民學校) for Peninsular children are managed by the City School Union (市學校組合), with the mayor serving as the union president and Mr. Kim Sŭng-gi (金昇起) as vice president; the number of students reaches 5,000. The annual expenses of the school union are roughly as follows:
West District annual budget: 68,000 yen
City School Union budget: 190,000 yen
Observing from an economic perspective, the assets of Peninsular people total approximately 20 million yen, but there are no major capitalists in the city. The main reason for this, besides the rapid development due to it being a new city, is primarily that our country is currently under a wartime structure in an emergency situation, implementing economic controls. Seeing the Peninsular populace generally leading calm and composed economic lives even in such times is truly encouraging. As one example, last year, Peninsular people's national defense donations (國防獻金), contributions to the Soldiers' Support Association (軍人後援會賛助金), and donations to other social projects amounted to about 80,000 yen, plus tens of thousands of yen donated for education.
The Peninsular people residing in Mudanjiang are striving hard, considering Manchukuo their second homeland.
In the city, there are no splendid pleasure palaces, so to speak, to intoxicate young people, nor are there so-called modern cultural facilities.
In short, the city was rapidly constructed from a defense perspective, built with the bare minimum of materials.
Superficially, it is an extremely stark and newly emerging city.
However, even though it is such a simple, newly emerging city, the residents have not forgotten the hidden truth that it is being built with vibrant, burning hope and based on lofty ideals and beliefs. I specifically note and convey this to offer some reference to the readers, which would be my greatest fortune. <86>

The Influence of Peninsular People in French Indochina
By Ha Tong-hwan

I traveled to French Indochina (佛印) in the winter of Showa 8 (1933). Though I departed Korea wrapped in winter clothes, when I disembarked at the Haiphong docks, it was warm enough to remind me of midsummer in Korea. On the streets, the refreshing sight of Annamese girls (安南姑娘) in stylish straw hats, and in the parks, green lawns and blooming flowers—it was as if I had stepped into another world. Although I had imagined what the sights and feelings might be like, for me, visiting a perpetually summer country for the first time, everything was truly strange.
Haiphong: Haiphong is the best port in the Gulf of Tonkin, with regular ferry services to Hong Kong, making transportation frequent. In the city, there are many magnificent buildings such as provincial government offices and schools, and there is also a military force of two divisions. Commercially, the Chinese hold absolute dominance, followed by Indians. It is noteworthy that in recent years, the Annamese people have gradually become more civilized and are actively participating in various fields. The Peninsular compatriots are Mr. Chŏn Sŏng-hwa (田成和), who runs the Koryŏ Products Trading Company (高麗物産商會), and Mr. Yi Chi-yong (李枝用) of the Sŏkyu Inn (石由旅舘)—only these two.
Hanoi: A train journey of just over three hours from Haiphong brings one to Hanoi, the capital of French Indochina. Hanoi is the center of politics, military affairs, and economy. Politically, it is the seat of the Governor-General of French Indochina, and there are consulates from various countries. Militarily, it is the location of the French Indochina Army General Headquarters. Economically, it is a transportation hub where goods gather and disperse extensively, and commerce thrives. Due to these circumstances, the number of Peninsular people residing here is relatively large, mostly engaged in commerce. Before the Sino-Japanese Incident, there were twenty-one resident Peninsular people. Except for three or four who ran fixed shops, all were peddlers. This was because, at that time, peddling yielded better income than fixed businesses. However, after the Incident, peddlers were regarded as spies by the authorities of this country, and most were ordered to leave, leaving only a few now. What should be specially noted is Mr. Kim Yŏng-gŏn (金永健), a representative figure among Peninsular compatriots in French Indochina. He once held the position of department head of East Asian History at the French Indochina Far East Expo Graduate School (佛印遠東博大學院東洋史科) [likely EFEO or similar], and was not only treated well by the French Indochina authorities but also made unforgettable contributions for the sake of Peninsular compatriots. With the Incident, he resigned from his post and is now working at the Tokyo French Indochina Association (東京佛印協曾).
The Recent Situation of Peninsular People in French Indochina: What kind of businesses were Peninsular compatriots in French Indochina engaged in? The vast majority ran ginseng businesses, solely focused on saving money and returning to their homeland as quickly as possible. Consequently, there was no room for development, and even today, forty years later, there is absolutely no change from the time they first advanced into French Indochina, which is truly disheartening.
In contrast, the advance of mainland Japanese (内地人) into French Indochina began more than ten years after that of Peninsular compatriots, yet their progress is astonishing. To give one example, a certain pioneer of mainland Japanese development in French Indochina, the proprietor of the Dainan Kōshi (大南公司) in Hanoi, initially peddled barber tools when he first arrived in French Indochina. Now, he has amassed enormous wealth, established branches even in Saigon in southern French Indochina, and is a key player in Japan-French Indochina trade. This is merely one example; there are none among the mainland Japanese who have not achieved considerable success. This is solely the result of their efforts for the overseas development of mainland Japanese, with the resolve to bury their bones in French Indochina. Although various special circumstances may have existed at the time, the lack of progress and apathy of Peninsular compatriots in French Indochina is truly shameful. If we Peninsular compatriots had built a foundation like the mainland Japanese, what remarkable activities and development might we have initiated upon the historic turning point in East Asia, the stationing of the Imperial Army (皇軍) in French Indochina? Thinking of this brings only long sighs.
French Indochina's gold deposits are also quite abundant, especially
(Continued on page 89) <87>
"The Influence of Peninsular People in French Indochina" Continued (Continued from page 71) [Note: source page reference likely incorrect, should be 87]
There is much placer gold along the banks of the Mekong River (メメン河畔). During my stay in French Indochina, I conducted an on-site investigation of this and applied to the French Indochina authorities for mining permission, but it was not granted, and I returned empty-handed. Now, with the stationing [of Japanese troops] in French Indochina, and the conclusion of a new Japan-French Indochina trade treaty, not only gold but also other underground treasures of French Indochina will gradually be developed by the progress of Japanese assets and technology.
Recent Situation of the Annamese People: France's colonial policy is extremely harsh, severely suppressing the cultural and external development of the Annamese people. For example, although they adopted a policy of absolutely prohibiting foreign travel for Annamese people, in recent years, the Annamese have gradually become civilized, illiteracy has decreased, and their admiration and trust towards Japan and the Japanese people are extraordinary. Perhaps it is only the Annamese people who wholeheartedly welcome the current stationing [of Japanese troops] in French Indochina. The character of the Annamese people is gentle, and their food resembles that of Korea. Economically, they are wealthier than Korea due to two harvests per year and an abundance of various fruits. Among the Annamese, the number of women is extremely large, with a female-to-male ratio of eleven to one. Therefore, women's rights are strong, and the activity of women in all industrial sectors is noteworthy. —(End)— <89>

**Summary**

This 1942 article from *Samch'ŏlli* magazine presents four reports on Korean communities in Japanese-occupied Nanjing, Beijing, Manchukuo (Mudanjiang), and French Indochina. The reports detail the increasing migration of Koreans following Japanese expansion, describing population numbers (e.g., 500 in Nanjing, 20,000+ in Beijing, 50,000 in Mudanjiang), settlement patterns (often forming distinct Korean districts), economic activities ranging from legitimate trade and labor to illicit businesses like opium dealing (criticized in the Beijing report), community organizations (schools, associations), and interactions with Japanese authorities and local populations. While some reports express optimism about future prospects (Nanjing, Mudanjiang), others lament a perceived lack of long-term vision or ethical conduct among Koreans compared to mainland Japanese settlers (Beijing, French Indochina). For historians, this article provides valuable contemporary insights into the diverse experiences of Koreans under Japanese colonialism, revealing demographic data, socio-economic conditions within the diaspora, the complexities of navigating life under imperial rule, and the official (pro-Japanese) narrative framing their role in the expanding empire. The candid criticism of Korean involvement in the opium trade in Beijing and the comparison with successful "mainland Japanese" settlers are particularly revealing aspects of the colonial dynamic and internal community issues.

南京の朝鮮人近況
木下至切

我半島人達は今度の事變を契機として當地に居住するもの五百名に達する數に於ては北京、天律、上海等大都市より遙に少數では有るが、皆眞面目に活動してゐるのは喜ばしい事だ。顧れば朝鮮と南京とは昔から餘り緣が無つた今を距る約二百七拾年前淸朝初葉に明が淸の壓迫に堪へず僅か此南京に於て氣息荏苒としてゐる時、朝鮮は飽迄淸を嫌ひ明に同情して款を通じ遙か南京迄使節の往來が有つた。
或人は南京半島人の數が他の都市に比べて遙かに少數なるを見て南京は將來半島人の發展性に乏しいと云ふが吾人は右論に反對する。南京は半島人の爲め一番有望な所と思ふ、或一定の場所に地盤を造へるのに一年二年の短期間に出來るものではない將來共十年以上の長時日の勤勞と苦心を要する上海、天津、北京、濟南。樣な所は二三十年以前から半島人の土臺が立派に堅められた所て又相當に犧牲も拂つてゐる。其れに比べて南京は事變前後の半島人が同類同質の者てない全く入り交つて來たことを憶へねばならぬ。これから一層懸命に活動せねばならぬ積極的に土臺を造らるばならぬ。恐らくは十年後には幾萬名の半島同胞が相當な地盤を持つ樣になるだらう。何故南京は將來一番有望な處てあるか他所は旣に夫々地盤が在來在留者に依つて占領されてある爲め地盤を持つものだけ仕事がしやすい新來者には立脚が非常に困難であるが南京たけは在留民の殆が新枚であり又も餘り多くない爲め敏活に働けば、今が頂度其時機である。場所もあり仕事は幾らでも活動家を待つて居る千載一遇の好機會だ。余は半島同胞事業家に南京視察を勸めたい。百聞一見に如かず着眼すれば有望な事業が何程でもある。＜84＞

北京朝鮮人の在り方
靑山文作

(北京)北支に來でから二年半の歳月を閱した。然し北京にのみ住んでゐだのではなく彼地此地へと點々生活をしておつた自分が、その淺眼をもつて斯る貴量な誌上を通じて北支に於ける半島同胞の消息を充分に傳へるかとうか？しかし編輯者の最初の依賴でも依り簡單に、ことわることも色々な事情に依りて容易なることでもないともかく私に對しては餘り過重なる負擔であるにも拘らず止むを得ず筆を取ることにした今日我が同胞の北支に於ける一般的事情を列記するには颇る困難である從つて北京に於る半島同胞にも共通なる事情でもあらう然らば北支に於る商工界の狀况は如何？これまた活潑性を缺き微弱を呈してゐる關係上、吾等半島人の北支生活は單純極まるものと云へよう先づ北京在住同胞の沿革から述べることにする。
半島同胞が北支に居住したのは今より三十三四年前即中華民國以前からだと思ふその當時は僅か十名內外であつたと謂はれる主として彼等は外の不平客、或は行商人であつた。かくの如く商人と言へば朝鮮より高麗人蔘を持つて來てそれを賣つては中國古物を買占めて半島に持歸つた行商人達があつた。ここで特に記すべきことは北京市の東城蘇州胡同內に泡子胡同と云ふ町がある此處は尹永保なるものが半島娼婦、中國姑娘を傭つて、料理業を開店したのが北京に於ける半鳥人營業の始まりであつたと謂はれる。
それ以來、在住同胞が漸次增え、民國元年頃には半島靑年の留學生十餘名と商賣人であつた。しかし大部分は外の不平者達で總計七十八名に達したとも謂はれる。その後二十年間は別に居住者の數は變りなかつたが昭和八年の滿洲事變以後から今次支那事變を契機として多數の同胞が流れ込んで來た。その數は去る六月一日の民會■査に依ると二萬名を遙るかに突破し驚異的數字を示してゐる。(戶數六千六百八十餘戶)しかし寒心に堪えないことは彼等に固定せる職業がないことだ商工界を一瞥するに北京では唯一なる存在である天幕製造工場の朝日テント合資會社を始め××鑛業會社(不明)等の商社が主なるものである。その他文化界に於ては宋百憲氏の經營する開明戱院、崔鳳瑞氏の營む華北戱院等であり、その他、多少商業方面に活躍せるものかなりある樣である。しかしその七八割は不正業者？であらう、これ實に我等·半島民衆の反省すべきことであるは、■言を要しない。數十萬を「阿片」賣買に投じて、日に數萬圓の利益を儲る商賣は利するところがあつても斷然放棄せねばならぬ例へ飢死すると雖もこの際半島同胞は人類のために目先の利に溺れず或は又半島人同胞に數十萬圓の利益を得るにしても絕對に阿片商賣から一日でも早く足を洗はなければならない我等が若しも永久的にこの不正業を營む時は中國人が我節半島人に接する時、良き感情をもつてつき合はないことは火を見るよりも明るかなことであらう。＜85＞

牡丹江の半島同胞
金三悅

(牡丹江)牡丹江市は、滿洲國の東北部にあり、牡丹江省の省城である。牡丹江省は昭和十二年七月一日新設された省であり。同市は昭和十二年十一月三日市制に改編された新興都市である。牡丹江市は、完全に建國後國防的必然性に據りて建設された都市である。
建國當初卽ち昭和七年頃には、人口僅か四千五百の一部落に過ぎながつたが、十年後の今日には驚異的發展をなし、人口二十萬餘に達してゐて滿洲國に於ける重要都市の中に列せられてゐる。斯かる發展に伴つて、牡丹江市附近に居住する我が半島同胞も又之の驚異的發展を躍進滿洲帝國の一縮圖たらしめんとして渾身の努力を拂つてゐるのである。以下は牡丹江市に居住する半島人の消息を簡單に記して紹介せんとする。
我が半島人は金人口の卄餘萬の約四分之一を占め、その戶數は約一萬戶に達してゐるこれらのものは、昭和八年以降增加したものて、その約七割は市の西南部に居住し其處は完全に半島人街を成して、集團生活を營んでゐる。その他三割は市内各區に散在し約一割は同市の郊外地城に住み農業を營む者約二割に達してゐる。
要するに我が半島人は、市政の補助機關であり一種自治機關でもある。西區は區長姜禮桓氏が領導とし一般的行政方面をも擔當してゐるのである。
敎育方面に於いては、市長を組會長に薦し副組會長金昇起氏の下にて市學校組合で經營する半島人兒童の爲めに國民學校が九校、生徒數は五千名に達してゐる。眩學校組合の年費は大略以下の如し。
西區一年豫算六萬八千圓
市學校組合豫算十九萬圓
經濟方面より察すれば半島人の資産は總額約二千萬圓に算してゐるが、同市で最も大なる資産家はない。その重なる原因は、又新しい都市であると云ふ意味に依つて急速的な發展にも依りますけれども然し最も大なるものは目下我が國は戰時體制の非常時局である經濟統制を實施してゐるかでもある。斯かる時局にでも半島人一般は沈着極まつた經濟生活を營んでゐるのをみると實に心强くなる。その一例として昨年一年間半島人の國防獻金、軍人後援會賛助金及びその他社會事業の據金が、約八萬餘圓と、敎育のための據金が數萬餘圓を據出してゐる。
牡丹江に居住する半島人は滿洲國を彼等の第二故鄕として奮鬪してゐるのである。
市內には若き靑年達を陶醉される燦爛とした亨樂殿堂とも云ふべき樂園もなければ所謂近代的文化施設もないのである。
要するに同市は、國防的見地に依つて急速的に建設されたもので、竟り最小限度素材をもつて建設されたものである。
表面上は、極めて殺風景な新興都市でもあるのだ。
然し斯かる簡楚を新興都市とは雖へそこには、活潑に燃える希望と祟高なる理念と信念に依つて、建設される眞實性が潜んでゐることを居住者は忘れてゐないことを特に記し傳へ讀者諸氏に多少の參考を供せば筆者は敢へて甚幸とするところである。＜86＞

佛印に於ける半島人の勢力
河東永煥

筆者が佛印へ赴たるは昭和八年の冬なり。外奪に包まれて朝鮮を出發したるも海防埠頭に降りたる時は朝鮮の眞夏を偲ばせる程にして街頭には安南姑娘の見るも淸々しき麥藁帽の伊達姿公園には緣の芝生爛漫たる花恰も別天地に足を踏み人れたるが如し、日に映り身に感じたる數々は斯くやあらんと想像はせしもの、初めて常夏の國を訪問したる筆子にとりてはすべてが奇異そのものなりき。
海防、海防は東京灣第一の良港にして香港との間には定期連絡船あり、交通頻繁なり、市內には省官衙學校等宏壯なる建物多く且つ二個師團の兵力有り、商業的には中國人が絕對優勢にして印度人これに次ぐ、近年安南人も漸次開化して各方面に互り活潑なる活躍をなしづつあるは注目に値す、半島同胞は高麗物産商會を經營する田成和氏及び石由旅舘の李枝用氏の二人なり。
河内、海防より汽車にて三時間余すれば佛印の首都河內に達す、河內は政治軍事經濟の中心地なり即ち政治的には佛印總督の所在地にして各國領事館あり、軍事的には佛印軍總司令部の所在地なり、經濟的には交通の要衝にあたり物資の集散夥しく商業殷盛を極む。斯かる關係上此處に在留する半島人は比較的に其の數最も多く槪ね商業に從事す日支事變前居留半島人は二十一名にして固定的に商店を營むもの三·四人を除けば悉く行商をなせしなり。これ當時にあたりては行商とは云へども收益に於て固定的商業より良かりし故なり。然れども行商人は事變後當國よりスパイ視されて其大部分は退去を命ぜられ今は僅かに數名を残すのみ。竝に特筆すベきは在佛印半島同胞の代表的人物たる金永健氏なり氏は曾て佛印遠東博大學院東洋史科々長の職にあり佛印當局より厚遇されたるのみならず且つ半島同胞の爲めにつくせる功勞は沒すべからざるものあり。氏は事變と共に職を辭し今は東京佛印協曾に勤務中なり。
佛印に於ける半島人の近況、佛印に於ける半島同胞は如何なる事業に從事せしやと謂ふに其の大部分が人蔘商賣を營み唯金を溜めては一日も早く故鄕に歸えることにのみ夢中なるが故に發展の餘地無く四十年後の今日と雖も彼等の佛印進出當時と毫も變る所なく實の寒心の至りなり。
これに反し内地人の佛印進出は半島同胞のそれより十年以上後れたるも其の躍進は驚くべきものあり一例を擧ぐれば内地人の佛印開拓功勞者にして河内大南公司經營者たる某氏は初めて佛印に渡りたる時理髮器具の行商をなせしが今や巨萬の富を成して南佛印の西貢にまて支店を設け日本佛印間貿易の立役者なり。これは僅かに其の一例に過ぎず其他にも内地人にして相當なる成功を遂げざりしは無しこれ專ら彼等が骨を佛印に埋むる覺悟にも内地人の海外發展の爲め努力せる賜物に外ならず。當時にありては色々特殊なる事情存せしことならんも在佛印半島同胞の不進步無氣力は慘愧に堪へざる所なり。我等半島同胞も内地人の如く地盤を築きたりしなば皇軍の佛印進駐と云ふ東亞の史的轉換期に際し如何に目覺しき活躍發展を開始せしことならん、思ひここに到らば唯々長嘆息あるのみ。
佛印の金の埋藏量も相當豊富にして特に

「佛印の半島人勢力」繼續(七一頁より繼續)
メメン河畔に砂金多し、私は滯佛印中これが實地調査に當り佛印當局に採掘許可を申請したるも許せざる所となり空しく歸れり、今や佛印進駐に伴ひ新しく日佛印通商條約も締結されたれば金を始め其他佛印の地下寶庫も邦人の資産技街の進步によりでは漸次開發さるるに至るべく。
安南人の近況、佛蘭西の植民地政策は甚だ苛酷を極め安南人の文化的對外的發展を極度に抑ふるに故に列へば安南人の外國旅行の如きも絕對に許可せざる方針を取りたるにも拘らず近年安南人は漸次開化されて文盲も減り特に日本及日本人に對する憧憬信賴は一方ならざるものあり。今回佛印進駐を衷心より歡迎するものは安南人のみならん安南人の姓格は溫順にして飲食物は朝鮮に類似す經濟的には年二回の收獲が出來る外各種の果物が豊富なる故朝鮮より富裕なり安南人は女性の數甚だ多く女性對男性の比率が十一對一なり、其れ故女權强くあらゆる産業部門に於て女性の活躍は注目に値するなり。―(終り)―＜89＞
