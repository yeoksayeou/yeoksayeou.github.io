The Police Affairs Bureau (警務局) has increased the number of police officers (警官) by 415 this year.

Simultaneously, to expand the security network, they have adopted the principle (主義) of establishing one police substation (駐在所) in each *myŏn* (面) throughout all of Korea (全朝鮮) and have begun its implementation (實現). It is said that there are currently about 300 *myŏn* without a police substation. <24>

**Summary**

The article reports that the colonial Police Affairs Bureau increased its police force by 415 officers in 1933. Concurrently, it initiated a plan to establish one police substation (*chujaeso*) in every *myŏn* (sub-county administrative unit) across Korea to strengthen the security network, noting that approximately 300 *myŏn* still lacked one. For historians, this piece is interesting as it quantifies the expansion of the colonial police apparatus and explicitly states the policy objective of achieving complete geographical coverage with police substations at the *myŏn* level, reflecting the intensification of surveillance and control in rural Korea during the 1930s.
