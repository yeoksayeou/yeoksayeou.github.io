Modern Notebook 1, If You Want to Become a Beauty
						Hyŏn Hŭi-sun

Do not go around sticking your neck out.

Walk with lively steps.

Unpleasant sights are dirty socks and unpolished shoes, they say.

You should respect individuality rather than following trends.

Plump people should wear dark colors, thin people light colors.

Ill-fitting socks are often worn where they are easily seen.

Walk without bending your knees, stretching them straight.

Always maintain a lively expression; that, they say, is the way to make you a beauty. <72>

**Summary**

This short article by Hyŏn Hŭi-sun offers advice to Korean women in 1933 on how to achieve modern beauty. The tips focus on posture (not sticking out the neck, walking straight-legged), gait (lively steps), hygiene and appearance (clean socks, polished shoes), personal style (individuality over trends, color choice based on body type), and demeanor (a lively expression). From a historical perspective, the piece is interesting as it reflects the adoption and dissemination of Western-influenced "modern" beauty standards and etiquette in colonial Korea. It highlights concerns about physical presentation, the tension between individuality and fashion trends, and the prescriptive nature of advice literature aimed at women during a period of social change. Historians might find the specific advice (e.g., posture, color choices, emphasis on socks and shoes) revealing about the particular aspects of modernity being emphasized and the perceived shortcomings in traditional comportment or dress.

						玄喜順
목을 쑥 빼 내밀고 단이지 마시요.
거름은 활발하게 거르시요.
보기 실흔 것은 양말 더러운 것과 안 딱근 구두래요.
류행을 따르지 말고 개성을 존중해야 할 것이요.
뚱뚱한 사람은 짓흔 색 여윈 사람은 엿흔 색으로.
잘 뵈는 데는 잘못시는 양말이요.
무릅을 꿉히지 말고 쭉쭉 펴서 걸으시여.
항상 생생한 표정을 가지시요, 그것이 당신을 미인되게 하는 법이래요. ＜72＞
