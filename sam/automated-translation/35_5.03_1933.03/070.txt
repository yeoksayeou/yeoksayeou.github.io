Self-Portrait of a Beauty: If Only I Had a Dimple on My Cheek
						Kim Chahye

How am I supposed to draw a portrait of myself when I'm tall enough to steam and eat like a poplar tree (찜쩌 먹게), my face is just long, and there's nothing particularly noteworthy about it? What a truly awkward situation!

Anyway, I am quite tall. Besides that, because my build isn't plump, I look even taller. Even so, I don't wish to be even 1 *pun* shorter than I am now, and I am quite content.

My face—if only it were just a little rounder. Sometimes I used to wish, "If only I had double-lidded eyes," but now I think,
"If only I had a well (what they call a dimple (에꾸보)?) on my cheek."

My face looks plain and bland, just like my personality. Though it seems it would be nice if it had a somewhat particular and charming expression, it's all impossible. My ugly and homely face. Still, I must be content with this and always live smiling. A smiling face must surely be much better than an angry one! <5>

**Summary**

The author, Kim Chahye, offers a self-deprecating yet ultimately accepting self-portrait in this short piece. She describes herself as very tall with a long, plain face, lacking distinct features. She humorously laments her appearance, wishing at different times for a rounder face, double eyelids, or currently, dimples. Despite these perceived flaws, she resolves to accept herself and maintain a smiling demeanor, believing it's better than looking angry. For historians, this article offers a glimpse into personal beauty standards and self-perception among educated Korean women during the colonial period. The casual use of a Japanese loanword ("ekkubo" for dimple) and the specific expressions of desired features reflect the cultural milieu of the time.

麗人自畵像, 빰에 에꾸보나 잇섯더면
						金慈惠
포푸라나무 찜쩌 먹게 키는 크고 얼골이라고는 길기만 하고 이러타 집어낼 만한 데도 업는 내 화상을 엇더케 그려쓰라우? 참 딱한 노릇 다 보겟네!
하여튼 나는 어지간이 키가 크외다. 게다가 몸집이 뚱뚱하질 언어서 더 커 뵈지요. 그러타고 지금보다 1分이라도 더 적기를 바라지 안으며 아주 대 만족임니다.
얼골은―쪽금만 동그랫스면 어던 때는 「쌍가풀진 눈을 가젓스면」햇드니 지금은
「빰에 우물(에꾸보라든가요)이나 하나 잇섯스면」
함니다. 내 얼골은 내 성질 그대로 평범하고 물너 뵘니다. 좀 까다로워 뵈고 깜직스러운 표정을 가젓스면 조흘 듯 해도 다 불가능한 일이외다. 밉고 못난 내 얼골. 이래도 만족하고 늘 웃고 지내야지요. 웃는 얼골은 성낸 얼골보다는 훨신 날 터이니까! ＜5＞
