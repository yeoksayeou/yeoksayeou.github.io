**Summary**

This is a brief company announcement from the magazine Samch'ŏlli. It informs readers that the upcoming April issue will be released around March 20th and boasts of its "brilliant content." It also seeks individuals interested in establishing branch offices for the magazine throughout the "Thirteen Provinces," indicating an effort to expand its distribution network across all of Korea. From a historical perspective, this announcement reveals the magazine's operational scale and ambition during the colonial period. The call for branches across the Thirteen Provinces (a term encompassing the entirety of traditional Korea) underscores the magazine's national scope and potentially hints at its role in fostering a sense of Korean identity and connection despite colonial rule.
