We are establishing Samch‘ŏlli branches in every nook and cranny (坊坊谷谷). Those who are interested, please request the internal regulations (內規).
Samch‘ŏlli Company <72>

**Summary**

This short text is an advertisement from the Samch‘ŏlli Company, publisher of the *Samch‘ŏlli* magazine, announcing its plan to establish branch offices "in every nook and cranny" (throughout the country). It invites interested individuals to request the company's internal regulations, presumably outlining the requirements and procedures for setting up and running a branch. For historians, this notice illustrates the magazine's ambition to expand its distribution network and readership across colonial Korea in the early 1930s, reflecting the growth strategies of Korean cultural and commercial enterprises during that period.
