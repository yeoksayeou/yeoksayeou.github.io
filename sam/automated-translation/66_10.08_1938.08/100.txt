Critique of the Thirteen Provincial Governors - On Kangwŏn Province Governor Kim Si-gwŏn
						by Songhwa Hagin

Among the governors of the 13 provinces, there are five who are peninsular people (반도인). They are all figures from success stories; individuals who were serving as employees (雇員) or low-ranking officials (判任官) at the time of annexation are now commanding a province as Governor "Your Excellency" (知事영감). For a peninsular official, becoming a Governor is currently the highest peak one can reach. Not everyone who served as a Councilor (참여관) becomes a Governor, and seeing one or two, or even two or three, senior councilors (칙임 참여관) taking "honorable retirement" (勇退者) each year shows that becoming a Governor "Your Excellency" is indeed very difficult. Consequently, the five current peninsular Governors are all talented bureaucrats, well-regarded by both Japanese and Koreans (內鮮人). However, it is regrettable that, as is a common failing (通弊) of modern bureaucrats, most are officials whose talent surpasses [their other qualities] (才勝), and few possess the magnanimity (胸度) of a statesman or the aspirations and passion of a new type of bureaucrat. The subject of this critique, Kangwŏn Province Governor Mr. Kim Si-gwŏn (金時權), is famous for being well-versed in administrative affairs and is thoroughly a man of common sense with an amiable personality. Before transferring to Kangwŏn Province, his first appointment was as Governor of Chŏlla North Province. There, a major incident arose from the conflict between the citizens of Chŏnju <77> and Iri over the relocation of the Chŏnju Technical Training School (全州공업전수학교) to Iri. As a result, in April of last year, the Governor, Director of Internal Affairs, and Director of Police of Chŏlla North Province were all demoted. Governor Kim was transferred to Kangwŏn Province, Director of Internal Affairs Furuichi (古市) was transferred to become Mayor of Taegu (大邱府尹), and Director of Police Murouchi (室內) was transferred to become a foreign affairs section official at the headquarters. As it was an incident that caused an uproar among the citizens of both Chŏnju and Iri, the Government-General at the time deemed the provincial authorities' handling indecisive and carried out such personnel changes. The disciplinary action against the three executives of Chŏlla North Province at that time was considerably debated within official circles.

Of course, it is wrong to judge Governor Kim's character solely based on his demotion as the highest responsible person in the province for this incident. However, it is true that in handling this incident, Governor Kim's common-sense personality, a failing of the talented (才勝한 通弊), prevented him from dealing with the matter decisively. Furthermore, it is a fact that the entire provincial executive team got caught up in the commotion of the citizens of both places, failed to take firm measures, hesitated, unable to do either this or that, and ultimately had to bear responsibility for the failure.

Mr. Kim Si-gwŏn was born on May 11, Meiji 17 (1884) in Chaeryŏng (載寧), Hwanghae Province (黃海道), making him 55 years old this year.
He graduated from the Government P'yŏngyang Japanese Language School in March, Meiji 41 (1908) and briefly taught at the private Pyŏksŏngŭisuk (碧城義熟) school in Haeju (海州). In Meiji 42 (1909), having resolved to enter government service, he transferred to become a clerk (主事) at the Wŏnsan Finance Office (元山財務署), then served as a secretary (書記) in Hoeryŏng County (會寧郡), Hamgyŏng North Province. In March, Taishō 3 (1914), he was promoted to Magistrate of Kyŏngwŏn County (慶源郡), Hamgyŏng North Province. Subsequently, he served as Magistrate of Onsŏng (穩城) and Kyŏnghŭng (慶興) counties, and held positions as Section Chief of Commerce and Industry, Social Affairs, and Local Affairs in Hamgyŏng North Province. He was the first peninsular person to serve as Section Chief of Local Affairs in both Hamgyŏng North and P'yŏngan South Provinces. Then, in Shōwa 3 (1928), he became the first peninsular appointee as Director of Finance (재무부장) (in Hamgyŏng South Province), and again in Shōwa 5 (1930), the first as Director of Internal Affairs (내무부장), becoming an object of envy (標的) for peninsular bureaucrats, and his administrative skills (사무가적 수완) were praised by the world. In Shōwa 7 (1932), he was transferred to become a Councilor in Kyŏngsang North Province, promoted to Director of Industry, and in August Shōwa 9 (1934), he even undertook a six-month inspection tour of Europe and America. In May Shōwa 11 (1936), he was promoted to Governor of Chŏlla North Province, and in April of last year, transferred to Kangwŏn Province. As can be inferred from his brief biography, he is quite renowned as an administrator, and it is said that he is the foremost expert in administrative affairs within the peninsular officialdom.

His constitution was originally weak, and at one time his health was a great concern,<78> but since transferring to Kangwŏn Province, his health has recovered, and he is devoting himself to reforming the provincial administration (道政쇄신) of rapidly advancing (약진) Kangwŏn Province.
Kangwŏn Province was traditionally known as a mountainous region with nothing but remote villages (벽촌), and there was a time when officials transferred to this province all considered it solely a demotion (좌천). However, in recent years, Kangwŏn Province's fisheries, mining, and power generation businesses are being developed, with the abundant marine resources of the East Sea coast and the underground resources of the mountainous areas being exploited. This year, the provincial budget surged past 7 million won, showing a dramatic increase (격증) of over 2 million won compared to the previous year.
Furthermore, having talented individuals of the peninsular officialdom's rising vigorous spirit (반도 官界의 신진氣銳의 영재) such as Director of Internal Affairs Yŏmjŏn (鹽田) and Director of Police Sanch'on (山村) assisting him as his two wings (兩翼) will be a great strength for Mr. Kim. We hope that he will exercise further self-discipline (자중) and strive harder for the reform of provincial administration at this time when Kangwŏn Province's existence as a rapidly rising first-class province has become distinct.<79>

**Summary**

This article profiles Kim Si-gwŏn, the Governor of Kangwŏn Province in 1938, one of only five Koreans holding such a high position under Japanese colonial rule. It praises his administrative expertise, tracing his career from a low-level official to governor, highlighting his status as a pioneer for Korean bureaucrats in certain roles. However, it also critiques him as a typical "talented bureaucrat" lacking statesmanlike vision, citing his indecisive handling of a controversial school relocation issue in his previous post as Governor of Chŏlla North Province, which led to his demotion/transfer. The article concludes by noting Kangwŏn Province's recent rapid development and expressing hope that Kim, aided by capable Korean subordinates, will lead the province effectively.

For historians, this piece offers insight into the careers and perceived limitations of high-ranking Korean collaborators within the Japanese colonial administration. It reflects the colonial narrative of developing Korea (specifically Kangwŏn Province) while subtly reinforcing the idea that Koreans, even successful ones like Kim, might excel in administration but lack the political decisiveness attributed to ideal leaders (implicitly, Japanese). The mention of the Chŏnju-Iri incident and the subsequent demotion of top provincial officials (Korean and potentially Japanese) hints at the internal tensions and challenges within the colonial governance structure. The term "peninsular person" (반도인) itself is a notable marker of the colonial era's terminology.

十三 知道事 人物評 - 江原道知事 金時權 論
						松花學人
13道知事 중에 반도인知事가 5인이 있다. 모다 立志傳 중의 인물뿐으로 합병 당시에는 雇員 혹은 判任官으로 재직하든 사람들이 금일에는 知事영감으로 한 도를 호령하고 있다. 반도인 관리로서는 知事가 되면 현재에 있어 최고봉이라 하겠는데 참여관을 지낸 사람이라면 다 - 知事가 되는 것도 아니고 칙임 참여관을 최후로 매년 1, 2명 또는 2, 3명 식의 勇退者가 있는 것을 보아도 知事영감이 되기도 매우 어렵다. 따라서 금일 반도인知事 5씨는 모다 준재관료로 內鮮人간에 자못 호평이다. 그러나 현대관료의 通弊이지만 才勝한 관리가 대부분이요, 정치가적 胸度나 신관료다운 포부, 열의를 가진 사람이 적은 것이 유감이다. 이에 논평할 강원도知事 金時權씨는 행정사무에 정통하기로 유명하며 철두철미 상식인으로 원만한 성격을 가젔다. 강원도로 전근하기 전에 전북知事가 초임이었었는데 全州공업전수학교의 裡里이전문제로 全州,＜77＞ 裡里 양지 시민의 쟁탈 갈등으로 큰 문제를 야기하였든 사건이 있서 작년 4월에 전북은 知事, 내무부장, 경찰부장이 모다 좌천되었다. 金知事는 강원도로 古市 내무부장은 大邱府尹으로 室內 경찰부장은 본부 외무부사무관으로 전근되었다. 일시 全州, 裡里 양 시민을 떠들게 한 사건이니만치 당시에 총독부에서도 도당국의 조치가 우유부단하다 하야 如斯한 인사이동을 단행하는데 당시의 전북도 3 간부의 처단은 官界에서 상당히 논란된 바 있었다.
물론 이러한 사건에 도의 최고책임자로서 좌천을 당했다 해서 이것만을 가지고 곧 金知事의 위인을 논평을 하는 것은 잘못이다. 다만 이 사건 처단에 있어 金知事의 才勝한 通弊인 너무 상식적 성격이 사건을 과단적으로 처리를 못하게 하였으며 또 도간부 전체가 兩地 시민의 소동 중에 끼여서 단호한 처치를 못하고 이러지도 못하고 저러지도 못하야 주저하다가 실패한 책임을 저야할 것만은 사실이다.
金時權씨는 明治 17년 5월 11일에 황해도 載寧에서 출생하였는데 당년 55才이다.
씨는 明治 41년 3월에 관립 평양일어학교를 졸업하고 海州 사립 碧城義熟에서 교편을 잠시 잡었었다. 明治 42년에 단연 官界로 진출할 결의를 가지고 元山재무서主事에 전직하였다가 다시 함북 會寧郡서기를 지내고 大正 3년 3월에 함북 慶源군수로 영진하였다. 이어서 穩城, 慶興군수를 지내고 함북상공과장, 사회과장, 지방과장을 역임하였다. 반도인으로서는 씨가 최초로 함북, 평남, 양도 지방과장을 지내었다. 그리하야 昭和 3년에는 반도인 초대의 재무부장 (함남) 또 5년에는 역시 초대의 내무부장에 임명되야 반도관료의 선망의 標的이 되었고 또 其 사무가적 수완을 세상이 칭찬하였다. 昭和 7년에는 경북참여관으로 전근, 산업부장으로 승진하야 9년 8월에는 6개월 간의 歐米시찰까지 하였다. 11년 5월에 전북知事에 영전, 작년 4월에 강원도로 전근하였다. 씨의 약력을 보아도 推知할 수 있는 바와 같이 사무가로 상당히 명성이 높은데 씨가 행정사무에 비상히 밝은 것으로는 반도 官界에서 제 1인자이라 한다.
본래 체질이 약하야 일시는 其 건강이 매우 염려되드니＜78＞ 강원도에 전근한 이래는 건강도 회복하야 약진 강원도의 道政쇄신에 정진하고 있다.
강원도라 하면 종래에는 벽촌 밧게 없는 산간지대로서 관리들도 이 도에 전근되면 모다 좌천만으로 알어온 시대가 있었다. 그런데 수년 來 강원도는 수산, 광업, 발전사업 등 동해안선의 수산과 산간지대의 지하자원이 풍부하게 개발되고 있어 금년도는 도예산도 일약 7백만원을 돌파하야 比전년 2백여만원의 격증을 示하였다.
더욱 강원도에는 鹽田내무부장, 山村경찰부장 등과 같은 반도 官界의 신진氣銳의 영재가 兩翼이 되야 씨를 보좌하고 있는 것은 씨에게는 큰 힘이 될 것이다. 더욱 자중하야 일약 일등도로서의 강원도의 존재가 뚜렷하여진 이 때에 일층 자중하야 道政쇄신에 매진하기를 바란다.＜79＞
