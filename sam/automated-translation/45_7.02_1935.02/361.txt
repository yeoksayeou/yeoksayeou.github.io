**Summary**

This brief article reports on the program of a congratulatory meeting held in 1915 (Taishō 4) for graduating female Korean students in Tokyo, organized by the Women's Friendship Association. The event took place at the Iida-machi Church and included prayers, addresses, a song, responses from graduates including the notable Na Hyesŏk, and a musical performance. For historians, this piece offers a glimpse into the activities and networks of early Korean female intellectuals studying abroad during the colonial period, highlighting the Christian influence (church venue, prayers) and listing prominent figures involved in such early feminist or student movements. The presence of Na Hyesŏk as a graduate speaker is particularly noteworthy.
