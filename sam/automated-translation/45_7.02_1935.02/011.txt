Recruitment of Branch Offices

If there is not yet a Samch'ŏlli branch office where you (先生) are located, we hope you will encourage yourself or a friend (友人) to establish one. The Branch Office Regulations (支社規約), which are profitable (利益) and convenient (輕便), will be sent upon request (請求).

Samch'ŏlli Company <16>

**Summary**

This short notice is an advertisement by the Samch'ŏlli Company, publishers of the Samch'ŏlli magazine, soliciting individuals ("先生" - Sŏnsaeng, a general term of respect) to establish local branch offices for the magazine. It promises that the regulations for setting up a branch are profitable and convenient and offers to send them upon request. From a historical perspective, this text reveals the magazine's distribution and expansion strategy during the colonial period, relying on local agents or entrepreneurs motivated by potential profit. It shows the business side of cultural production and the methods used to broaden reach in the 1930s Korean market.
