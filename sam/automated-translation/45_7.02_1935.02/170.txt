**Body Text Translation:**
Samch'ŏlli Salon

Every prestigious (名門) or wealthy (富豪) family has strict house rules (家規). It is said that Pak Yŏngch'ŏl, the president (頭取) of the Commercial Bank, is good at treating others to food or clothing, but never gives cash under any circumstances. Furthermore, he manages the household finances (家計) so strictly that if the monthly household income and expenditure calculation is off by even 5 *chŏn*, he makes the steward (執事) stay up all night to correct it.

It's said that Yun Ch'iho gives monthly allowances to all his family members; for instance, so much for his wife, so much for his daughter, and so much for his son attending elementary school, and he doesn't give a single *p'un* more than this allowance.

Han Sangnyong is said to distribute the smokeless coal (無煙炭) used in the rooms of his house in winter in strictly fixed amounts, meaning three lumps on cold days and three lumps on hot days.

Dr. Chŏng Sŏkchin absolutely does not wear fans, white shoes, white hats, or white suits in the summer. Also, no matter how late it is, he never lets young children ride the streetcar (電車). His son, who currently attends the Second Higher Common School (第2高普), is also made to walk (徒步) that long distance.<116>

**Summary**

This article offers glimpses into the strict and sometimes eccentric household rules and personal habits of prominent Korean figures in 1935: banker Pak Yŏngch'ŏl's extreme financial meticulousness, Yun Ch'iho's allowance system, Han Sangnyong's rigid coal distribution, and Dr. Chŏng Sŏkchin's peculiar summer attire rules and insistence on walking instead of using public transport for his children. For historians, this piece provides insight into the lifestyles, values (particularly regarding frugality, discipline, and perhaps assimilation or distinction) and daily practices of the Korean elite, including figures associated with finance, education, and potentially collaboration, during the Japanese colonial period. It reflects how traditional notions of household management intersected with modern life and colonial society.
