From the Editorial Department

We are now sending out the February issue. We can only express our gratitude for your enthusiastic readership of the New Year's issue. The coming month of March is a fine season when the frozen ground thaws, the sound of chicks is heard, and even spring rain falls. Therefore, for the upcoming March issue, we will create an unprecedented spectacle, increase the page count*, and put it out with special editing. Please look forward to it greatly.<300>

From the Sales Department

The New Year's issue required a second printing, but that too sold out, so for orders placed after January 20th, there were many cases where we could not send it and sent the February issue instead. We ask for your understanding and hope that from now on, you will always place your orders well in advance.<300>

From the Publishing Department

Among the two major pamphlets published by our company, An Chae-hong's "China Today and the Future of the Far East" (中國의 今日과 極東의 將來) will be published on January 31st, and Yŏ Un-hyŏng's "Collected Speeches" (演說集) will be released in early February.
The 4th edition of "Peace and Freedom" (平和와 自由) has also been released. Please place many orders.
The new magazine "Samch'ŏlli Literature" (三千里文學), which has been in the planning stages for a long time, is under preparation with the aim of launching it without fail in March.<300>

**Summary**

This article comprises three short notices from the Editorial, Sales, and Publishing departments of Samch'ŏlli magazine in February 1935. The Editorial Department thanks readers for the success of the New Year's issue and promises an expanded, special March issue. The Sales Department explains that the New Year's issue sold out quickly, requiring substitutions for late orders, and urges early pre-orders. The Publishing Department announces the imminent release of pamphlets by An Chae-hong and Yŏ Un-hyŏng, a 4th printing of "Peace and Freedom," and the planned launch of a new literary magazine, "Samch'ŏlli Literature," in March.

Historians might find this piece interesting as it reflects the active publishing environment and reader engagement in colonial Korea despite restrictions. It highlights the popularity of the magazine, the promotion of specific intellectual figures like An Chae-hong and Yŏ Un-hyŏng, and the expansion plans into literary publishing ("Samch'ŏlli Literature"), indicating cultural aspirations and activities during the period. The mention of specific publication dates and reprint needs provides concrete data points about publishing logistics and reception.
