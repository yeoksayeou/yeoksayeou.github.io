Women of the Three Dynasties

Observing the women of Chosŏn (Korea) through the ages, the women of ancient times were gentle and virtuous, frequently visited temples, were rich in compassion, were faithful in the home, and also submissive.

The women of medieval times were cheerful and splendid, enjoyed songs, indulged in pleasure without regard for the decline of the family, and delighted in music and dance.

The women of modern times were rich in reason, liked power and authority, revered their family lineage, were cold-hearted, and had a tendency to pursue wealth and nobility.

The colors reflected in the women of ancient Silla, medieval Koryŏ, and modern Yi Dynasty Chosŏn are precisely these. In the Silla dynasty, there were queens like Queen Sŏndŏk and Queen Chinsŏng, both of whom cherished the populace, protected temples, provided relief for the poor, and eradicated diseases, receiving praise as graceful female sovereigns and also as monarchs of a nation.

Originally, Chosŏn received earlier, broader, and deeper influence from the religion of India rather than from continental culture.
Therefore, the foundation of Silla lies in religion, specifically, the faith of Buddhism.
Silla's culture, arts, politics, laws, even the national constitution and family customs, were all built entirely upon Buddhist faith. Any artifact excavated from the underground culture (地下文化) in present-day Kyŏngju invariably possesses Buddhist characteristics.

Especially looking at the Korean people of the three dynasties period, the Korean people of Silla were gentle, humble, and peaceful in their homes, but when faced with difficulties and going to the battlefield, they were sharp warriors who advanced with valor. Furthermore, throughout the long 1,000 years of Silla, the number of historical tales and stories about the abundant compassion of Silla women is immense.
Those who delve into the Samguk Yusa learn of the beautiful stories and fine tales (美談佳話) about the virtue of Silla women, who sometimes transformed into tigers (虎) or turned into wood and stone (木石) while sending off their husbands on distant expeditions.
Moreover, the passion of Silla women who established relief centers (救養所) for the poor and created shelters (慰留所) for sick travelers, striving in rescue efforts, is something rarely seen in modern times.<159>

Entering the Koryŏ period, its culture received the influence of martial valor from the northern continent. Buddhism, the state religion since Silla, gradually produced corrupt practices (弊風). The grandeur and joy of Buddhist faith gradually became formalized. Especially as religious rituals came to be adorned with song, dance, and music, spiritual faith gradually degenerated, and only formal rituals steadily increased. The P'algwanhoe (八開會), which could be called Koryŏ's state-established social club, enshrined the Buddha, and the sounds of hanging flowers (係花), playing music (奏樂), singing praises (歌咏), and the shadows of dance turned it into an alley of pleasure where day and night could not be distinguished. Koryŏ women, like modern women of the Interior Land (內地女性 - Japan), were absorbed in hedonism (享樂主義), lost their chastity (飾操), and merely revered splendor and luxury (華美豪奢).

Even towards the Yuan (元), an unprecedentedly powerful state that unified the world, they sent women to secure diplomatic standing (國交의 地步) and curry favor (歡心) with the powerful nation. They produced music, dance, architecture, sculpture, and even the essence of Koryŏ, Koryŏ ware (高麗器), thus unfolding the golden age of East Asian art (東亞藝術) through the Koryŏ dynasty. Koryŏ women, with incense, fire, flowers, and clothes (香火花衣), utterly captivated the statesmen of the Mongol Empire (蒙古帝國) with the rich character of Koryŏ femininity.

Compared to the extravagance (奢侈) and splendor (豪華) of Koryŏ women, the women of modern Chosŏn underwent an unusual transformation.
The women of modern Chosŏn were suddenly put under confinement (禁足). Temples were burned (燒却), monks and nuns were expelled (逐放), and radiant Buddha statues with halos (後光燦爛한 佛像) were thrown into ditches (溝中에 投棄). In contrast, distinctions between men and women (男女의 別) were made, husbands and wives lived in separate quarters (夫婦의 居處를 달니하고), and etiquette and ethics (禮儀倫理) were regulated. The bright energy (陽氣) of the home suddenly vanished. Women hid in the inner chambers (內室에 隱돈), and the distinction and intentions between men and women became law. Chosŏn women, who had been free and open (自由開放) for 1,500 years since Silla, ended up being thrown into a kind of prison of etiquette (禮儀牢獄).

Lively yet sharp (怜悧한), strongly jealous, hysterical, rational (理智的인) women; the character of women showing cold intelligence—they possess beauty (美色) but lack emotion (情緖); their well-arranged complexion (整美된 顔色) shines (光輝) but lacks fragrance (香氣); they have the bravery (勇敢性) to delight in power (勢) and love victory, but have lost the gentleness (柔和性) to console the defeated. The most revered qualities of women, gentleness (柔和) and compassionate love (慈愛), ended up being removed from the women of modern Chosŏn. <160>

**Summary**

This 1935 essay contrasts the characteristics of Korean women across three dynasties: Silla, Koryŏ, and the Yi Dynasty (referred to as "Modern Chosŏn"). Silla women are depicted as virtuous, compassionate, devoutly Buddhist, and brave, forming the bedrock of a gentle yet strong society. Koryŏ women are portrayed as lively, artistic, and luxurious, influenced by continental culture and later hedonism, using their charm even in diplomacy but losing spiritual depth. Yi Dynasty women are described as undergoing a stark transformation, becoming confined by strict Neo-Confucian rules, losing their warmth and compassion despite gaining rationality, ultimately trapped in a "prison of etiquette." The author laments the loss of gentleness and compassion in these "modern" (Yi Dynasty) women compared to their predecessors.

For historians, the article is interesting as a reflection of 1930s colonial-era views on Korean history and gender. The idealized portrayal of Silla and the critique of Koryŏ and especially Yi Dynasty women (contrasting them negatively with Silla's idealized past and even contemporary Japanese women implicitly via the 'Naeji' reference) could reflect nationalist sentiments attempting to reclaim a glorious past or internalized colonial narratives about Chosŏn's supposed stagnation leading into the modern era. The sharp critique of Yi Dynasty Neo-Confucian restrictions on women is particularly notable.

三王朝의 女性
朝鮮의 女性을 時代的으로 觀察하면 上古時의 女性은 柔和貞淑하여서, 寺刹에 參拜를 잘 하엿고, 慈愛心이 豐富하엿고, 家庭에 잇서서는 忠實하엿고 도한 忍從的이엿다.
中古時의 女性은 明朗하엿고, 華美하여서 歌曲을 질기고, 歡樂에 耽하여 家庭의 頹癈도 도라보지 안코 音律과 舞踊을 질겨 하엿다.
近代의 女性은 理智에 富하고 權勢를 조와하야 家門을 崇尊하고, 冷酷하여서 富貴를 쫏는 風이 잇섯다.
上古 時의 新羅 中古 時의 高麗 近代의 李朝가 그들 女性에게 빗초인 色彩가 즉 그것이다. 新羅의 王朝에는 女王으로 善德女王, 眞聖女王이 게서 어느 분이나 다 民衆을 愛撫하고, 寺院을 保護하며 貧困을 救濟하고 疾病을 退治식여, 優雅한 女性의 國王으로써, 또한 一國의 君主로써 讚仰을 밧엇다.
원래 朝鮮은 大陸文化보다는 印度의 宗敎로부터 빨으고, 넓고, 깁흡 感化를 밧엇다.
그럼으로 新羅의 根底는 宗敎에 잇다. 즉 佛敎의 信仰이다.
新羅의 文化, 藝術, 政治, 法律로부터 一國의 國憲까지도, 家風도 專혀 佛敎의 信仰으로 싸엇다. 現今 慶州로부터 發掘되는 地下文化는 엇던 것이나 佛敎의 色彩가 업는 것이 업다.
특히 朝鮮 3朝의 時代 民族을 바라보면 新羅의 朝鮮民族은 집에 잇서서는 柔和謙遜하고 和平한 民衆이엿고, 難에 逢着되여 戰場에 나가서는 勇武邁進하는 尖銳한 武士이엿다. 더욱 新羅 1,000년의 長途에 잇서 新羅女性의 慈愛의 豐富한 小說史話는 許多할 程度이다.
新羅女性의 貞淑은 혹은 범(虎)으로 탈을 쓰고, 혹은 木石으로 變해서 그 夫君의 遠征 出陣을 보낸 美談佳話의 이약이가 三國遺事를 들치는 者로 하여금 알게 된다.
또한 貧民을 위해서 救養所를 設置하고 行路病者를 위해서 慰留所를 만들어 救護에 힘쓴 新羅女性의 熱情은 現代에 잇서서는 도저히 보기 드문 일이라 할 것이다.<159>
高麗時代에 이르러서는 그 文化에 北方大陸의 武勇感化를 밧고, 新羅 以來의 國敎 佛敎는 점차 弊風을 나허, 佛敎信仰의 盛大함과 歡喜는 점차 形式化하고, 특히 歌舞音曲으로써 宗敎的 儀禮로 裝飾하게까지 되여 精神的 信仰은 점차 墮落되여 形式的 儀禮만이 점점 增長되고, 高麗의 國設 社交俱樂部라 할 만한 八開會는 佛陀를 奉安하고, 係花, 奏樂, 歌咏의 소래, 舞踊의 거림자가 晝夜를 分別할 수 업는 歡樂의 巷으로 化햇다. 高麗女性은 現代 內地女性처럼 享樂主義에 采迷하고, 飾操를 일코, 다만 華美豪奢로 崇極햇다.
世界를 統一한 空前의 强大, 元의 대헤서도 女性을 보내서 國交의 地步를 차지하고 雄國의 歡心을 사서 音樂, 歌舞, 建築, 彫刻乃至 高麗의 精華 高麗器를 製作하야 東亞藝術의 全盛時代는 高麗王朝에 의해서 開展되고, 高麗의 女性은 香火花衣로써 蒙古帝國의 政治家로 하야금 高麗女性의 色彩에 豐富한 風貌로 低迷식여 마지 안엇다.
高麗女性의 奢侈와 豪華에 比해서 近代朝鮮의 女性은 異常한 轉變을 지웟다.
近代朝鮮의 女性은 별안간에 禁足을 하고, 寺院을 燒却하여 僧尼는 逐放되고 後光燦爛한 佛像은 溝中에 投棄되고, 그에 대해서 男女의 別을 짓고 夫婦의 居處를 달니하고, 禮儀倫理를 規律지여서 家庭의 陽氣는 忽然히 사러지고 女性은 內室에 隱돈하고 男女의 區別과 心志는 法律로 되여 新羅 以來 1,500年間 自由開放되엿던 朝鮮女性은 一種의 禮儀牢獄에 投入되고 말엇다.
活發하면서 怜悧한 嫉妬心이 강하고 히스테릭한 理智的인 女性, 冷然하게 聰明함을 보이는 女流의 風貌는 美色이 잇스나 情緖가 업고, 整美된 顔色은 光輝하지만 香氣가 업고, 그 勢를 깁거워 하고 勝利를 사랑하는 勇敢性은 잇스나, 敗者를 慰撫하는 柔和性은 일코 女性의 가장 尊崇할 柔和와 慈愛의 性情은 近代 朝鮮女性으로부터 除去되고 말엇다. <160>
