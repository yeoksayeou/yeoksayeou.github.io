Touching Friendships (感激할 友情)

Between Mr. Yun Ch'i-ho and Mr. Sin Hŭng-u

After the events of the Kimin year (己未, 1919), when Mr. Sin Hŭng-u (申興雨) had to step down as the principal of Paejae Haktang (培材學堂) and his public reputation was gradually diminishing in society, the one who extended a warm hand to rescue Mr. Sin was Chwaong (佐翁) Yun Ch'i-ho (尹致昊). Mr. Sin Hŭng-u's circumstances at that time were such that he had no money, faced social criticism, and felt the lament of an "isolated castle at sunset" (孤城落日). At that time, Chwaong donated 2,800 wŏn of his private funds to buy the vast residence near Sŏdaemun, Seoul, where he currently resides. He also brought him into the Young Men's Christian Association (基督靑年會) as General Secretary after Mr. Ku Cha-ok (具滋玉). Through this opportunity, the relationship between Chwaong and Mr. Sin Hŭng-u became even more intertwined with "respect and affection" (尊敬과 親愛). It is said that even when resigning from the YMCA General Secretary position this time, Mr. Sin Hŭng-u handled it from beginning to end under the guidance of Mr. Yun Ch'i-ho.

Between Mr. Kim Yak-su and Mr. Yi In

After Mr. Kim Yak-su (金若水) was released from prison and recovered his health, he intended to create a media organization. The person who assisted him at this time, enabling him to launch the magazine *Taejung* (大衆), was the lawyer Mr. Yi In (李仁). It is said he provided assistance amounting to several hundred wŏn (數 300원).

Between Mr. Kim Sŏng-su and Mr. Chang Tŏk-su

The mother (慈堂) of Mr. Chang Tŏk-su (張德秀), who is in America (米國), resides in Seoul. Several years ago, she happened to reach her 60th birthday (回甲). Having lost her eldest son, Mr. Chang Tŏk-chun (張德俊), in the northern Manchurian (北滿) wilderness and her third son, Mr. Chang Tŏk-chin (張德珍), to an unnatural death (非命) at the Shanghai (上海) docks, her later years (晩年), with her only surviving second son, Mr. Chang Tŏk-su, sent across the vast Pacific (太平洋), were quite <155> lonely. At this, Mr. Kim Sŏng-su (金性洙) covered all the expenses for the 60th birthday celebration, arranged a grand banquet for the day, and invited prominent figures of the capital (長安人士) to give her a day of joy. It is said that upon hearing this news from afar, Mr. Chang Tŏk-su, who was then in London (倫敦), England (英吉利), wept at such deep friendship. <156>

**Summary**

This article highlights three instances of remarkable friendship among prominent Korean figures during the colonial period. It recounts how Yun Ch'i-ho financially and professionally supported Sin Hŭng-u after the latter faced difficulties following the March First Movement. It also mentions lawyer Yi In providing funds for Kim Yak-su to start a magazine after his release from prison, and Kim Sŏng-su funding a grand 60th birthday celebration for the mother of Chang Tŏk-su, who was studying abroad, demonstrating profound care during a difficult time for the family. From a historical perspective, these anecdotes are interesting as they reveal the personal support networks and loyalties among Korean elites under Japanese rule. Yun Ch'i-ho's actions are particularly notable given his later complex political stance, showing his continued personal connections and support for figures impacted by nationalist activities. The stories offer glimpses into the personal lives and financial capabilities of these individuals and the importance they placed on mutual aid and friendship.
