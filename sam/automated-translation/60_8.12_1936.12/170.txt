In the slums of Fukagawa-ku (深用區), Tōkyō, a business selling single cigarettes for one chŏn each has appeared. Gradually, won't it also become possible in Sŏul to pay just one chŏn to buy and smoke one cigarette? Like this, as cigarette packs begin to get pricier, the means to buy a whole pack disappears. Meanwhile, a prize announcement was made by the French Air Minister in Paris, offering 300,000 francs for first place, 100,000 francs for second place, and 50,000 francs each for three third-place winners for flying between Paris and Tōkyō within one hundred hours. If only An Ch'ang-nam were alive, he would have said he'd try it.<81>

**Summary**

This short piece juxtaposes the economic hardship indicated by the new practice of selling single cigarettes in Tōkyō's slums (and the possibility of it spreading to Sŏul) with the announcement of a large cash prize by the French government for a rapid flight between Paris and Tōkyō. The author wistfully remarks that the deceased pioneering Korean aviator, An Ch'ang-nam, would have attempted the flight challenge if he were still alive. From a historical perspective, the article offers a glimpse into the economic pressures faced by ordinary people in the colonial era, contrasting local poverty with global technological advancements and aspirations. The mention of An Ch'ang-nam reflects Korean interest in aviation and perhaps a sense of national pride and loss associated with this figure.
