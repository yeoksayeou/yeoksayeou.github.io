江南風月
Hong Myŏnghŭi's Humor

When Mr. Hŏ Hŏn's wife passed away, Mr. Hong Myŏnghŭi came to offer condolences. As it was after the funeral day, Mr. Hŏ Hŏn, whose sorrow had somewhat lessened, was telling the story of his wife's last moments in front of several mourners.
"Her mind was clear until the very end, and she left these last words: 'Our connection in this life ends here, and I must go, but let us meet again in the next life and resolve our lingering regrets.'"
At that moment, Pyŏkch'o Hong Myŏnghŭi said,
"Will there be a way to resolve lingering regrets even if she is reborn as a woman in the next life? In the next life, Kyŏng'in (兢人 - Mr. Hŏ Hŏn's pen name) should become the wife, and the departed wife should become the husband. When Kyŏng'in goes to the next life, he must be prepared to become a wife."
The whole room smiled.

Elder Yu Chint'ae's Tearful Bow
Elder Paegŭn Yu Chint'ae, a senior figure in our society and a heavyweight in the Ancestral Education Association (祖先敎育協會), has lived a life of utter poverty (적빈 如洗) for 70 years, especially in his later years, living as a humble scholar in plain clothes, bending his knees to sleep (曲股而寢之하는 布衣寒士). The other day, when his daughter was hovering between life and death due to a serious illness, he rushed to the pharmacy to get three packs of herbal medicine. However, he had no money in his pocket. Unable to bring himself to lie, before asking for the medicine, he said,
"I don't have money today, but I will definitely bring the payment within a few days, so please prepare just three packs of medicine."
Upon hearing this, the pharmacist's expression changed abruptly (아연 변색), and putting the pestle he had lifted back down on the ground, he said,
"Oh dear, we've run out of ginseng. I can't prepare the medicine without ginseng."
Elder Paegŭn just turned and left. Tears welled up (글성글성) in the eyes of that resolute old man.
The cost of the medicine was 70 *chŏn* per pack; the total for three packs was only 2 *wŏn* [Note: The text says 20圓, likely a typo for 2圓 10錢, or perhaps hyperbole]. Hearing this sad story passed from person to person, everyone shed tears silently (潛然). Alas, the righteous man and money!

Minsae's Letter
Minsae An Chaehong, said to still be under preliminary investigation (豫審中), is undergoing his 6th or 7th period of imprisonment (囹圄生活)... Lately, he is reportedly studying Korean history intently. A letter that recently arrived for his children was filled with words like,
"Don't stay in Seoul; go down to the distant countryside. The studies you are doing now are all useless, so pack up your book bundles (冊褓) and return to the farming villages."<24>

**Summary**

This article presents three short anecdotes about prominent Korean figures in 1936. The first recounts a humorous exchange between Hong Myŏnghŭi and Hŏ Hŏn concerning Hŏ's deceased wife. The second tells a poignant story of the respected elder Yu Chint'ae's extreme poverty, highlighting his inability to afford medicine for his critically ill daughter. The third mentions An Chaehong, imprisoned, advising his children via letter to abandon their studies in Seoul and return to the countryside. From a historical perspective, these anecdotes offer glimpses into the social dynamics, the severe economic hardships faced even by esteemed intellectuals, and the political oppression (An Chaehong's repeated imprisonment and disillusionment with urban life/studies) prevalent during the Japanese colonial period. Historians might find the portrayal of poverty affecting the elite and the implied critique of the colonial system through An Chaehong's message particularly interesting.

江南風月
洪命熹氏의 諧謔

許憲氏 喪配하였을 적에 洪明熹氏가 조문을 왔다. 葬日도 지난 뒤이기 哀愁가 다소 덜친 許헌씨가 여러 조객 압헤서 부인이 임종하든 때 이약이를 하는데
「마즈막까지 정신이 맑아서 이런 유언을 다했어요. 우리가 이생서는 인연이 이뿐이 되어 나는 가나 저생서 다시 맛나 미진한 恨을 풀어보게오」
라고요. 그때 碧初 洪明熹씨가
「저생서까지 여인으로 태어나야 미진한 恨을 풀 길이 있을나고요? 저생선 兢人(許현氏雅號)이 녀편네되고 돌아가신 부인께서 남편이 돼야지요. 兢人이 저생갈 적엔 녀편네될 각오를 하서야지요」
滿座微笑

兪鎭泰翁의 一鞠淚
우리 사회의 元老요 祖先敎育協會重鎭인 白隱 兪鎭泰翁, 70 평생에 그야말로 적빈 如洗, 더구나 노년엔 曲股而寢之하는 布衣寒士로 지내신다. 去日 따님이 重病으로 생사의 境을 도라다닐 제 한약 3貼을 지으려고 약국으로 달녀갓다. 그러나 수중엔 無一錢, 참아 거짓말을 못해서 약짓기 전에
「내 오늘은 돈이 없으나 수일 내로 藥價를 꼭 갓다 드릴 터이니 약 3첩만 지어주오.」
말을 듯자 약국인이 아연 변색을 하며 들엇든 울정을 땅에 도로 놓으면서
「았불사 인삼이 떠러졋군. 삼이 없서 약 못 짓겠오.」
白隱老 그만 도라서 나오다 그 剛毅하든 노인의 두 눈엔 눈물이 글성글성.
약값은 한 帖에 70錢, 세 帖이 값 모다 처야 20圓. 이 슲은 이약이를 傳之聞之 듯는 사람마다 모다 눈물이 潛然, 오호 義人과 돈이여!

民世의 便紙
民世 安在鴻, 아직 豫審中이라 하야 6,7次의 囹圄生活을 하는 세음 ... . 요지간은 朝鮮史書 공부를 몹시 하는 中이라는데 일전 그의 자식들에게 나온 편지에는
「서울에도 있지 말고 먼 시골로 나려가 있거라. 「지금 하는 공부도 다 쓸데없으니 冊褓 거두어 쌓 질머지고 농촌으로 도라가 버리라」하는 글발이 가득 실렷더라고.＜24＞
