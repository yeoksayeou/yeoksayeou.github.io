Gangnam Pungwol (江南風月)

A Kŭnuhoe (槿友會) Women's Reunion After Seven or Eight Years
When the mother of Miss Hŏ Chŏngsuk (許貞淑女史), known from the Yŏil group, passed away recently, many first-rate activists who were once famous gathered together, something that hadn't happened in 7 or 8 years. Although when they frequented the threshold of the Kŭnuhoe (槿友會), their ages ranged from 17 or 18 to 22 or 23, all youthful beauties then, now wrinkles line their foreheads, gray strands are in their hair, and some even have five or six children under their care. Regardless, these individuals cast a streak of sorrow—"Life makes one old," "Even beauties grow old"—into the hearts of the many mourners gathered in the funeral ceremony square on a late autumn morning as raindrops fell drearily. Those gathered that day included Chŏng Ch'ilsŏng (丁七星), Hwang Sindŏk (黃信德), Sim Ŭnsuk (沈恩淑), Sŏ Sŏkchŏn (徐石田), U Pongun (禹鳳雲), Chŏng Sunhŭi (鄭順姬), Kang Agŭnniya (강아근니야), Yu Yŏngjun (劉英俊).

Ansŏ's (岸曙) Remarkable Tales of a Drinking Immortal
If one defines a "chudo" (酒徒 - drinker) as one who "does not refuse a cup of liquor (合酒不辭)," a "chuho" (酒豪 - heavy drinker) as one who "does not refuse a pint of liquor (升酒不辭)," and a "chusŏn" (酒仙 - drinking immortal) as one who "does not refuse a gallon of liquor (斗酒不辭)," then among the many scholars (多士) of the literary world (文壇), there are truly many drinkers (酒徒, 酒客). However, how many could be counted as drinking immortals (酒仙)? The gossipmongers of Seoul (京童) whisper that Messrs. Yŏm Sangsŏp (廉想涉), Yi Kiyŏng (李箕永), Yang Paekhwa (梁白華), Pak Wŏlt'an (朴月灘), Chŏng Chiyong (鄭芝鎔), and An Sŏgyŏng (安夕影) all belong to that category. And then, lowering their voices, the Seoul gossips (京童) add that surpassing even these gentlemen are the super-heavyweights (超弩級), poet Kim Ansŏ (金岸曙) and critic Kim Chinsŏp (金晉燮). One moonlit night, the two gentlemen sat facing each other at a tavern (旗亭) on Chongno (鐘路), began raising their cups (對座擧杯), and continued until late at night. When they counted the cups (計盃), do not be surprised: it was 30 cups each, standing and drinking. Excellent! (快哉!) As the drinking fortune (酒運) thrives, so too shall the literary fortune (文運) thrive.

Mr. Sŏ Hangsŏk (徐恒錫氏) Becomes a Governor (府使)
Mr. Sŏ Hangsŏk (徐恒錫氏) of Tong-a, an authority on German literature, brought smiles to literary figures by "arriving at his post (到任)" as a "governor (府使)." This happened in early October when the Theater Arts Research Society (劇藝術硏究會) staged "Ch'unhyangjŏn" (春香傳), adapted and directed by Mr. Yu Ch'ijin (柳致眞氏), at the Seoul Civic Hall (서울 府民館). In the very last scene, "The Appearance of the Secret Royal Inspector (御使出道)," right before that, he appeared in the banquet seat of the former Namwŏn magistrate (南原新官使道), wearing a large gat (hat) and dopo (robe) as the Governor (府使) of Koksŏng (谷城) county, performing with superb skill (入神之 名技) and earning the acclaim (喝采) of the entire audience (滿場).

Mr. O Sangsun's (吳相淳氏) Love of Smoking (愛煙)
Poet Mr. O Sangsun (吳相淳氏) is also renowned as a great smoker (吸煙大家). He smokes ten packs (열匣式) of cigarettes a day. Once, traveling with a friend, he boarded a train at Taegu Station (大邱驛), his hometown, bound for Seoul. From the moment he got on the train in Taegu, he lit a cigarette and continued lighting one after another without using a single new matchstick, arriving (當到) in Seoul still smoking. <47>

**Summary**

This article consists of four short anecdotes about cultural and social figures in 1930s Korea. The first describes a reunion of former members of the women's organization Kŭnuhoe at a funeral, reflecting on aging. The second discusses the heavy drinking habits of literary figures, highlighting an impressive drinking session between Kim Ansŏ and Kim Chinsŏp. The third reports on German literature expert Sŏ Hangsŏk's amusing cameo role as a governor in a theatrical production of Ch'unhyangjŏn. The fourth details poet O Sangsun's remarkable chain-smoking habit. For historians, the article offers glimpses into the social lives of intellectuals and former activists during the colonial period, revealing camaraderie, personal quirks, and engagement with traditional culture (like Ch'unhyangjŏn) amidst modernity. The mention of Kŭnuhoe members provides insight into the later lives of women involved in nationalist and feminist movements.

江南風月
七十八年만인 友會女性
요일전 許貞淑女史의 慈堂이 도라갔을 그때 같이 한때의 일홈 높든 一流運動家들이 만히 모여본 일이 7,8年 以來 일즉 섰업다.
비록 그 當時 槿友會, 門턱을 드나들 때는 나히도 17,8부터 22,3. 나는 紅顔美人이든 것이 而今엔 모다 이마엔 주름쌀 머리엔 센 터리 膝下엔 過한 분은 5,6男妹까지 두었지만은 어째든 늦인 가을 아츰 빗방울이 시름없이 내리퍼붓는 葬禮式廣場에 모였든 만흔 吊客의 가슴에 「人生은 늙는구나」 美人마저 늙는구나」 하는 一抹의 哀愁를 이 住人郡들이 던저주었다. 그날 모인 이는 丁七星, 黃信德, 沈恩淑, 徐石田, 禹鳳雲, 鄭順姬, 강아근니야, 劉英俊.

岸曙의 酒仙綺談
「合酒不辭」는 酒徒요 「升酒不辭」는 酒豪이요 「斗酒不辭」는 酒仙이라고 定義를 내린다면 文壇, 多士 中에 酒徒, 酒客이 實로 만으리라. 그러나 酒仙로 칠 분이 몇 분이나 될는고. 京童은 속삭거리기를 廉想涉, 李箕永, 梁白華, 朴月灘, 鄭芝鎔, 安夕影의 諸氏로 모다 그 계열에 속하리라고. 그러고 나즉하게 京童은 再言하되 여려분보다도 超弩級의 酒豪에 詩人 金岸曙와 評論家 金晉燮씨 있으니 兩氏 어느 月明夜에 鐘路旗亭에 對座擧杯를 시작하야 夜深에까지 이르러 計盃하매 놀나지 말지어다. 선술 각각 30杯式이었다고. 快哉라! 酒運盛하니 文運 亦 盛일지진저.

府使가 된 徐恒錫氏
獨逸文學의 권위인 東亞의 徐恒錫氏가 「府使」로 到任하여 文壇人에 미소를 보내다. 그것은 10월 초순 劇藝術硏究會에서 「春香傳을 柳致眞氏 脚色演出로 서울 府民館에서 上演하였는데 맨 나종 幕인 「御使出道」 卽前 南原新官使道의 주연석에 큰갓 쓰고 도포 입은 谷城고을 府使로 출연하여 入神?의 名技를 다하여 滿場의 喝采를 사다.

吳相淳氏의 愛煙
詩人 吳相淳씨는 吸煙大家로도 일홈이 잇다. 氏는 하로에 담배마코 열匣式 태는 바 한번은 어느 친구와 같이 고향인 大邱驛에서 기차를 타고 서울까지 오는 동안 大邱에서 차 탈 때부터 피어문 담배를 성양 한 대 안 켜고 그냥 연달아 물어 서울까지 當到했더라고.＜47＞
