Fans, Pray!
Miss Chi Kyŏngsun, who returned from Tokyo having gotten brand new, exceedingly splendid and stylish Western clothes made, was said to enchant people she met on the street. These days, however, her older sister has been hospitalized, and she is apparently too busy nursing her to have a moment's rest. Unaware of this, a certain fan of Miss Kyŏngsun is said to be very anxious (각급해), asking, "Why isn't Chi Kyŏngsun's smart appearance seen?" Since they are anxious, if her sister's illness gets better, Miss Kyŏngsun will be liberated onto the streets, so fans should pray for her sister's swift recovery.

From Film to Theater
Miss Kim Soyŏng, who widely spread her name (일홈) through Director An Sŏgyŏng's "Sim Ch'ŏng," finished the Ch'ŏnil Film Company's production "Kukkyŏng (國境)." Afterward, the story was that she would stay home and diligently manage her household (살님) for a while. However, it's said she recently joined the Kohyŏp Theater Troupe (高協劇團) and, as the troupe embarked on its first performance tour, she traveled with all the members through the Northern Korea (北鮮) region, making many fans laugh and cry with her fine features and beautiful appearance (맵씨).

The Reason for Sleeplessness
On the night the preview screening of "Mujŏng (無情)" was held at the Hwan'gŭmjwa theater, Mr. Yi Paeksu returned to his lodging after 11 PM after watching the preview! He spread out his bedding and lay down, but sleep absolutely wouldn't come. Even lying down with the lights off, his face (얼골) felt hot as if touching charcoal embers. It was because, no matter how hard he tried not to think about it, his own face, resembling exactly the image of a goat (염생이의 像), kept appearing before his eyes, making it unbearable.

Miss Han Ŭnjin's Recent News
Miss Han Ŭnjin, who became known to many people through her first appearance in Director Pak Kich'ae's "Mujŏng (無情)," is reportedly busy tending (각구기에) to sprouting and blooming (돋아나고 피여나는) flowers and plants while resting at home during the period before appearing in her second production.

Sounds Plausible
Frenchman: "If I get a lover, I'll have a drink that day."
American: "If I get 1 million won, I'll have a big drink that day."
Irishman: "When the day comes for me to depart this world, I'll have a drink." <75>

**Summary**

This article provides celebrity updates from 1939 Korea. It mentions actress Chi Kyŏngsun's return from Tokyo with Western clothes and her subsequent absence due to nursing her sister. It reports on actress Kim Soyŏng transitioning from film ("Kukkyŏng") to theater with the Kohyŏp troupe, touring Northern Korea. It humorously describes actor Yi Paeksu's sleepless night after seeing his own face, likened to a goat's, in the preview of "Mujŏng." Finally, it notes actress Han Ŭnjin, also from "Mujŏng," is resting at home gardening before her next role. The article concludes with a short, unrelated anecdote comparing French, American, and Irish attitudes towards drinking. From a historical perspective, the article reveals the growing celebrity culture in colonial Korea, the influence of Western fashion (洋裝), the activities of the early Korean film and theater industries (Ch'ŏnil Film Company, Kohyŏp Theater Troupe, films like "Mujŏng" and "Kukkyŏng"), and travel between Korea and Japan (Tokyo). The casual mention of Northern Korea (北鮮) as a tour destination is also notable.

三千里機密室, 佳人春秋
퐨들이여 祈禱할지어다
東京 가서 새로 아주 썩 훌륭하고 멋진 洋裝을 지여 입고 도라 온 池京順양은 거리에 맛나는 사람을 황홀케 한다드니 요새는 언니가 병원에 입원하서서 그 간호에 눈코 뜰 새 없게 되있다한다. 그런 줄은 모르고 京順양의 팬 중 어떤 자는
「池京順의 스마-트한 맵씨가 안뵈니 웬일이냐」고 매우 각급해 한다는데 각급해 하기보고 그 언니의 병환이 나으면 京順 양은 거리에 해방될 거이니 팬은 하로바삐 그 언니의 병환이 낫기를 기도할지어다.

撮影所通信
映畵에서 演劇에로
安夕影監督 沈淸에서 그 일홈을 널니 떨친 金素英 양은 天一映畵社 작품 「國境」을 끝낸 후- 당분간은 집에서 살님을 알뜰이 산다는 이얘기드니 지난번 高協劇團에 들어가게 되어 그 극단의 첫공연을 하게되자 團員 일동과 함께 北鮮지방을 순회했다는데 곻은 용모와 아릿따운 맵씨로 많은 팬을 웃고 울니였다 한다.

잠 못 이룬 까닭
「無情」 試寫가 黃金座에서 잇든 날 밤 試寫를 보고 밤 11시가 지나서 숙소에 도라온 李白水씨! 자리를 깔고 들어누었으나 잠은 도저히 올상 싶지 않었다. 불을 끄고 누어도 얼골이 숫불에 다른 듯 뜨거워 올났다. 꼭 염생이의 像같은 자기 얼골 아모리 생각말재도 눈에 떠올나서 견딀 수가 없었다든 까닭에.

韓銀珍孃의 近況
朴基采 監督 「無情」에 첫 번 出演해서 여러 사람에게 알여진 韓銀珍 양은 제2회 작품에 출연할동안 집에서 쉬면서 돋아나고 피여나는 花草 각구기에 분망하드라고.
