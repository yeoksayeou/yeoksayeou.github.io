Address Commemorating the Second Anniversary of the Holy War: Giving Thanks to the Officers and Soldiers of the Imperial Army

Our Japan (我日本), the leader of the Orient (東洋), now approaches July 7th, marking the second anniversary since embarking on the Holy War to construct a new order in Asia (亞細亞).

Looking back, since the single gunshot fired at the Marco Polo Bridge (盧溝橋), the Imperial Army (皇軍) has truly fought well and achieved consecutive victories in the Central Plains (中原) of over 400 provinces during these past two years. Not only has its military prowess been widely proclaimed both at home and abroad, but it has also thoroughly struck a blow against the stubbornness of Chiang Kai-shek (蔣介石) and the Nationalist Government (國民政府) in their resistance against Japan and accommodation of communism (抗日容共). At the same time, amid these brilliant military achievements, rare in ancient or modern times, we offer truly deep and sincere silent prayers for the fallen heroic spirits (戰沒英靈) of the 60,000 loyal, brave, righteous, and ardent officers and soldiers.

However, although the Holy War has already been underway for two years, the Nationalist Government and Chiang Kai-shek, failing to comprehend the true meaning of the conflict, still cry out for long-term resistance (長期抗戰), needlessly causing great sacrifices. In this situation, upholding the national policy of the Empire (帝國) aimed at long-term construction, we, the people behind the lines (吾等銃後國民), know that we must strive towards the completion of the sacred task of a New East Asia (新東亞) by further dedicating ourselves wholeheartedly, in both material and spiritual aspects, to conserving resources, expanding production capacity, encouraging savings, and opposing and rejecting communism (反共排共) in order to achieve the objectives of the Holy War. <7>

**Summary**

This editorial, published in the Korean magazine *Samch'ŏlli* in 1939, commemorates the second anniversary of the Second Sino-Japanese War (referred to as the "Holy War"). It extols the victories of the Japanese Imperial Army, condemns Chiang Kai-shek and the Chinese Nationalist government for their continued resistance, mourns Japanese war dead, and strongly urges the Korean population (as imperial subjects) to fully support Japan's war effort through austerity, increased production, savings, and anti-communist activities, all framed within the goal of building a "New East Asia" under Japanese leadership. From a historical perspective, the article is a stark example of pro-Japanese propaganda disseminated in colonial Korea, explicitly framing the war as a righteous "Holy War" and demanding active participation and sacrifice from Koreans for the Japanese Empire's goals. Historians would find the language used to compel Korean complicity and the adoption of Japanese imperial ideology particularly revealing of the pressures and narratives prevalent during this period.

聖戰二週年紀念辭 皇軍將士에 感謝함
東洋의 盟主 我日本이 今에 亞細亞에 신질서을 건설하는 聖戰을 기하야 이미 2주년을 맛는 7월 7일을 迎하게 되였다.
회고하건대 盧溝橋에서 터친 일발의 총성이 있슨 이래 그간 2개년 사이에 皇軍은 400여 州 中原에서 실로 善戰하였고 또한 連勝하야 그 武勳이 멀니 中外에 宣揚되였슬 뿐 아니라 蔣介石 及 國民政府로 하여곰 抗日容共의 그 頑冥을 痛擊하야 남음이 있었다. 동시에 다른 한편 이렇게 古今에 드문 赫赫한 戰果를 거둔 그 속에 忠勇義烈한 6만 將士의 戰沒英靈에 대하야는 실로 깊이 진심으로써 黙禱를 드린다.
그러나 聖戰이 전개되야 이미 2주년에 미첬으나 사변의 眞義를 解得하지 못하는 國民政府 及 蔣介石은 아직도 長期抗戰을 부르지저 부즈럽시 희생을 크게 하고 있다. 이에 있어 장기건설에 향하는 帝國의 國是를 밧들어 吾等銃後國民은 聖戰 목적 수행을 위하야 今後 더욱 일층 물자의 절약, 생산력 확충, 저축장려, 反共排共의 물심양면에 잇서 一意致心하야 新東亞 완성의 聖業에 邁進함이 있을 바인 줄 아노라.＜7＞
