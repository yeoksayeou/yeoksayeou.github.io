**Summary**

This text announces a special Japanese-language section within the Korean magazine *Samch'ŏlli*, titled "Korea and Koreans," spanning pages 1-16. It lists articles included in this section, covering topics such as the debate on suffrage (likely concerning Koreans) from the Imperial Diet proceedings, the "Thought War" (ideological control) discussed by Security Section Chief Shimomura, the "Nationality Problem" concerning Koreans also discussed by a Dr. Shimomura (possibly the same person), and a personal piece titled "My Boranto" by Pak Sŏk-yun. For historians, this piece is interesting as it highlights the types of political and social issues (suffrage, ideology, ethnicity) being discussed in Japanese, within a Korean publication, during the late 1930s colonial period. It shows the engagement of both Japanese officials (Shimomura) and Korean intellectuals (Pak Sŏk-yun) in these discourses, reflecting the complex socio-political landscape under Japanese rule.
