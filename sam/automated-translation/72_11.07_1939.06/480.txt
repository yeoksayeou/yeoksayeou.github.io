Zhu Xi's Nine Bends Song
Written by Zhu Xi, Translated by Yang Sangŭn

Are immortals playing on the high peaks of the Wuyi Mountains?
Where is the fine scenery amidst the clear water of the valley?
Oh, the sound of weighing anchor, how exhilarating it is!
武夷山上有仙靈 山下塞流曲曲淸
欲識個中奇絶處 櫂歌閑聽兩三聲 (On Wuyi Mountains dwell immortal spirits; Below the peaks, the stream flows clear, bend after bend. If you wish to know the uniquely wondrous spots within, Leisurely listen to two or three boat songs.)

Where is the first bend? It's a fishing boat by the rapids.
The reflection of Manting Peak's bent bridge is submerged in the water.
Only the distant evening smoke winds around.
一曲溪邊上釣船 慢亭峯影蘸晴川
虹橋一斷無消息 萬壑千岩鎖暮烟 (First bend: by the stream's edge, aboard a fishing boat; Manting Peak's shadow dips into the clear river. The rainbow bridge is broken, no news comes; Ten thousand ravines and a thousand crags are locked in evening mist.)

Where is the second bend? Jade Maiden Peak stands beautifully tall.
Holding plucked flower branches, for whom has she adorned herself? <269>
Filled with delight, shall I enter the deep, deep mountains?
二曲亭亭玉女峰 揷花臨水爲誰容
道人不復荒坮夢 興入前山翠幾里 (Second bend: gracefully stands Jade Maiden Peak; Inserting flowers, overlooking the water, for whom does she beautify herself? The Daoist no longer dreams of the desolate terrace; Inspiration enters the front mountains, green for many li.)

Where is the third bend? Launch the boat onto the blue waves.
In which year did they row the oars and play upon the sea?
Life is like a water bubble, I lament this.
三曲君看加壑船 不知停棹幾何年
桑田海水今如許 泡沫風燈堪自憐 (Third bend: look, sir, at the boat lodged in the gorge; Who knows how many years the oars have been stilled? Mulberry fields turn to sea, as things are now; Like foam bubbles or a lamp in the wind, worthy of self-pity.)

Where is the fourth bend? Cliffs rise left and right.
Dew-kissed flower buds sparkle in the moonlight.
The cock's crow is leisurely, yet there are no traces of people.
四曲東西兩石岩 岩花垂露碧蟹環
金鷄叫罷無人見 月滿空山水滿潭 (Fourth bend: east and west, two rock cliffs; Cliff flowers drip with dew, like blue crab carapaces. The golden cock finishes crowing, unseen by anyone; The moon fills the empty mountains, water fills the pools.)

The fifth bend: mountains are high, clouds and mist are dense.
In the smoke-wreathed forest, who would recognize a traveler?
The mournful sound of the boatman's song is heard, unsettling the heart.
五曲山高雲深處 長時烟雨暗平林
林間有客無人識 欸乃聲中萬古心 (Fifth bend: mountains high, clouds deep; Lingering mist and rain darken the level forest. There is a guest in the woods, whom no one recognizes; Amidst the sound of the 'Ai-nai' song, an eternal heart.)

The sixth bend is a green screen, encircled by blue waves.
Stopping the boat, cliff flowers fall. <270>
All day long, I closed the brushwood gate, hearing only birdsong.
六曲蒼屛遶碧灣 茅茨終日掩柴關
客來停棹岩花落 猿鳥不驚春意閑 (Sixth bend: a green screen encircles the blue bay; My thatched hut's brushwood gate is closed all day. A guest arrives, stops rowing, cliff flowers fall; Monkeys and birds are not startled, the spring mood is tranquil.)

Moving the boat to the seventh bend, I reached the blue rapids.
Looking back again at the Hidden Screen and Immortal Palm peaks,
After last night's rain, a chilly air lingers.
七曲移船上碧灘 隱屛仙掌更回着
却*昨夜峰頭雨 添得飛泉幾度寒 (Seventh bend: moving the boat up the blue rapids; Hidden Screen and Immortal Palm peaks, I look back again. Ah, last night's rain on the peak tops; Adds several degrees of cold to the flying springs.) (*Translator's note likely indicating a correction or emphasis on '却' meaning 'recall' or 'looking back at')

Where is the eighth bend? It is submerged in misty scenery.
The drum tower rock is high, the water flows back bend after bend.
Who says there are no fine views without coming to see?
八曲風烟勢欲開 鼓樓岩下水榮回
莫言此處無佳景 自是遊人不上來 (Eighth bend: wind and mist seem about to part; Below Drum Tower Rock, the water swirls back. Do not say this place lacks fine scenery; It's just that travelers do not come up here.)

Ascending to the ninth bend, the view before my eyes opens wide.
Mulberry and hemp trees, wet with dew, line the stream banks.
Where is the Peach Blossom Spring? This is a world apart.
九曲將盡眼豁然 桑麻雨露見平川
漁郞更覓桃源路 除是人間別有天 (Ninth bend: almost finished, the eyes open wide; Mulberry and hemp in rain and dew, a level plain is seen. Fisherman, seek again the road to the Peach Blossom Spring; Unless this is another heaven, separate from the human world.) <271>

**Summary**

This article presents a Korean translation by Yang Sangŭn of the famous Chinese Neo-Confucian philosopher Zhu Xi's "Nine Bends Song." The poem describes a journey down the Nine Bends River (Jiuqu Xi) in the Wuyi Mountains, a place renowned for its scenic beauty. Each stanza corresponds to one bend, depicting the changing landscapes, reflections, sounds, and atmosphere, often imbued with philosophical or Daoist sentiments about nature, solitude, and the passage of time. From a colonial history perspective, the publication of a translation of a classic Chinese poem into Korean in 1939 is noteworthy. It demonstrates the persistence of traditional East Asian literary culture and Korean intellectual engagement with it, even amidst Japan's increasing wartime mobilization and cultural assimilation policies. It suggests an underlying continuity of Korean cultural identity tied to the broader Sinosphere, potentially serving as a subtle counterpoint to forced Japanization.

朱憙의 九曲歌
						朱憙 作  楊相殷 譯
무이산 높은봉에 신선이 노는거나
골작이 물맑은데 곻은풍경 어듸메오
어기야 닷감는소리 기좋은가 하노라
武夷山上有仙靈 山下塞流曲曲淸
欲識個中奇絶處 櫂歌閑聽兩三聲

一曲은 어듸메오 여울가에 낙기배라
만정봉 굽은다리 물속에 잠겻고나
저멀니 저녁연기만 감아돌 뿐 이러라.
一曲溪邊上釣船 慢亭峯影蘸晴川
虹橋一斷無消息 萬壑千岩鎖暮烟

二曲은 어듸메오 옥여봉 고읍고야
꽃가지 꺾어들고 뉘를위해 단장했노
흥겨워 심심산천을 드러갈가 하노라.
二曲亭亭玉女峰 揷花臨水爲誰容＜269＞
道人不復荒坮夢 興入前山翠幾里

三곡은 어듸메오 창파에 배띄워라
어느해 노를젔고 바다우에 노랐든가
인생이 물버끔같으니 이를서러 하노라.
三曲君看加壑船 不知停棹幾何年
桑田海水今如許 泡沫風燈堪自憐

四曲은 어듸메오 左右로 절벽이라
이슬먹은 꽃봉오리 달빛에 반적인다
닭소리 한가로운데 사람흔적 없고나.
四曲東西兩石岩 岩花垂露碧蟹環
金鷄叫罷無人見 月滿空山水滿潭

五曲 산은높고 구름안개 자옥한데
연기서린 숩풀속에 나그내를 뉘가알가
애내성 구슬피들니니 마음산란 하여라.
五曲山高雲深處 長時烟雨暗平林
林間有客無人識 欸乃聲中萬古心

六曲은 창병인데 푸른물결 감아돈다
돗대를 멈추노니 바우꽃 떠러진다＜270＞
왼종일 사릅을닷고 새소리만 드럿네.
六曲蒼屛遶碧灣 茅茨終日掩柴關
客來停棹岩花落 猿鳥不驚春意閑

七曲에 배를옴겨 벽탄에 이르렀다
은병 선장을 또다시 도라보니
어젯밤 비나린뒤에 치운기운 도노라.
七曲移船上碧灘 隱屛仙掌更回着
却*昨夜峰頭雨 添得飛泉幾度寒

八曲은 어데있노 풍년속에 잠겼고나
루대는 높아는데 구비구비 불결이라
뉘래서 와보지않고 경치없다 하는가.
八曲風烟勢欲開 鼓樓岩下水榮回
莫言此處無佳景 自是遊人不上來

九曲을 올나서니 눈앞이 활연코나
뽕나무 이슬저저 내ㅅ가에 느러섰네
도원이 어데있는가 별유천지 이로라.
九曲將盡眼豁然 桑麻雨露見平川
漁郞更覓桃源路 除是人間別有天＜271＞
＜269-271＞
