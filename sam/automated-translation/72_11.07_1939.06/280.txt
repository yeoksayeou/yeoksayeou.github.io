The Life and Art of Solgŏ, the Divine Painter of Silla
						Yi Sangin

Who today, seeking the ancient capital of Silla—the highest hall of art in Korean history—would not be moved to tears!
The legend of the single scroll of an old pine tree painted on the wall of Hwangnyong Temple (黃龍寺) should indeed capture our ears even more, but today, with the temple dilapidated and the walls broken, the sound of a visitor's dragging shoes in the setting sun is merely desolate! Ah! The saying that culture is eternal must be true only one or two times out of ten!

But I digress—who was this person named Solgŏ (率居)? While his art was exceedingly mystical, historical documentation regarding him is exceedingly scarce. Is this also like a spring dream? This too makes one sigh repeatedly like the man from Qi worrying about the sky falling!

Kim Pusik (金富軾) in the *Samguk Sagi* (三國史本傳) states: 『Solgŏ was a Silla person. Because his origins were humble, his lineage is not recorded. He was skilled in painting from birth. He once painted an old pine tree on the wall of Hwangnyong Temple. The trunk had scales and wrinkles, the branches and leaves were twisting and coiling. Birds, kites, swallows often saw it from afar and flew towards it, only to hit the wall and fall, stunned. As years passed and the colors darkened, the temple monks restored it with pigments (丹靑), after which the birds no longer came. Also, the painting of the Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva at Punhwang Temple (芬皇寺) in Kyŏngju (慶州) and the Vimalakirti image at Tansok Temple (斷俗寺) in Chinju (晋州) are both his brushwork. They are passed down through generations as divine paintings (神畫).』

The *Tongwŏn T'onggam* (東園通鑑) states: 『When Hwangnyong Temple in Silla was completed, there was one Solgŏ who painted an old pine tree on the wall. The trunk had scales and wrinkles, the branches and leaves were twisting and coiling. Birds often saw it from afar and flew towards it, only to hit the wall and fall, stunned. As years passed and the colors faded, the temple monks restored it with pigments, after which the birds no longer came. Also, the Buddhist images at Punhwang Temple and Tansok Temple are both Solgŏ's handiwork. They are known世稱世稱) as divine paintings.』

The *Tongsa Yugo* (東事類考) states: 『Silla's Solgŏ was the son of a farming family. From a young age, he aspired to painting. When gathering firewood, he would draw on rocks with ivy roots (蔦根); when plowing, he would draw in the sand with the tip of his hoe (鋤尖). But being in a remote village, he had no teacher to receive instruction from, and thus had no way to achieve mastery. Solgŏ prayed day and night in his heart to the heavenly spirits (天神), wishing to receive divine teaching. After doing so for years, one day an old man appeared in his dream, saying, "I am the divine being Tan'gun (檀君). Moved by your utmost sincerity, I bestow upon you a divine brush (神毫)." Waking up startled, he eventually became a renowned master. Solgŏ, deeply grateful for the divine grace, painted nearly a thousand portraits of Tan'gun, imagining him as he saw him in his dream. Koru Yi Kyubo (高鹿李奎報) wrote in a eulogy for a portrait of Tan'gun painted by Solgŏ: "In every house beyond the mountain pass, there is an image of the divine ancestor; half of them in those days came from this renowned master."』

The *Chibong Yusŏl* (芝峯類說) states: 『During the time of King Chinhŭng (眞興王) of Silla, a person named Solgŏ painted an old pine tree on the wall of Hwangnyong Temple, and it is said that birds often flew into it. Indeed, his painting reached the divine. Was it only calligraphy that had Kim Saeng (金生)? That his name is not prominent in later generations is regrettable. Some say Solgŏ was the name of a monk.』<176>

The *Ko*tang Chip* (古*堂集) lamented with this poetic verse: 『What does it matter where Solgŏ came from? The national history still transmits the marvel of his Six Laws [of painting]; His wondrous skill allowed no other hand to touch up The old pine branch on Hwangnyong Temple's wall.』

These are the historical records about Solgŏ. They are all monotonous, half-mute accounts merely saying such a person existed. However, in our history, which is as hazy as a spring dream, it is rather fortunate that even this much historical record exists.
Thus, Solgŏ, from his youth, was a person of utmost sincerity, a person of truth, a person of diligence, a person of perseverance, and a person who faced adversity. More so, it is also true that his talent was extraordinary.
From phrases like 『Because his origins were humble (所出微故)』 or 『When gathering firewood, he would draw on rocks with ivy roots; when plowing, he would draw in the sand with the tip of his hoe (樵則以葛根劃岩 耕則以鋤尖劃沙)』, one can guess his unparalleled poverty. From 『prayed day and night in his heart to the heavenly spirits, wishing to receive divine teaching (日夜心祝于天神 願受神敎)』, one can glimpse how extremely sincere he was. And from phrases like 『Indeed, his painting reached the divine (蓋其畵入神)』, 『known as divine paintings (世稱神畵)』, or 「passed down through generations as divine paintings (世傳爲神畵)」, it is also true that his technique reached a realm of mystery.
Humble origins and adverse circumstances all melt away like spring snow before a genius of utmost sincerity, and only his sacred hall of art shone brilliantly.
What a pity that not even a single surviving painting of his can be seen! Solgŏ's painting! How could it be compared to Kim Saeng's calligraphy? Yet the world has completely buried him under the unattractive name of "calligraphy artisan (書工)". How can this not be a great loss to our art history and art world, and a matter of immense regret!
To those who visit Kyŏngju next time! When you explore the site of Hwangnyong Temple, even in its ruins, I make a promise with the reader to once again reminisce about Solgŏ's divine painting. 4, 18<177>

**Summary**

The article by Yi Sangin laments the lack of detailed historical records about Solgŏ, a legendary painter from the Silla period renowned for his incredibly lifelike paintings, particularly the pine tree mural at Hwangnyong Temple that birds reportedly tried to fly into. Despite his humble origins and lack of formal training, Solgŏ achieved mastery through dedication, sincerity, and possibly divine intervention (a dream involving Tan'gun). The author cites various historical texts (Samguk Sagi, Tongwŏn T'onggam, Tongsa Yugo, Chibong Yusŏl, Ko*tang Chip) that mention Solgŏ's skill, calling his works "divine paintings." The piece expresses deep regret over the loss of Solgŏ's works and his relative obscurity compared to figures like the calligrapher Kim Saeng, urging readers visiting the ruins of Hwangnyong Temple in Kyŏngju to remember the lost artist. From a colonial history perspective, the article's strong emphasis on a figure from Korea's ancient past (Silla's "highest hall of art"), the mention of Tan'gun as a divine bestower of talent, and the lamentation over lost cultural heritage can be seen as expressions of cultural nationalism and a yearning for past glory during a period of Japanese rule. The focus on indigenous genius and historical greatness served as a subtle counter-narrative to colonial assertions.

新羅 畵神 率居의 生涯와 藝術
						李相寅
오늘날 新羅의 古都-朝鮮史上의 최고 예술의 殿堂인 이 古都를 찾느니 뉘 눈물겨웁지 않으랴!
저 黃龍寺 壁上에 그려젔던 一幅의 老松 전설이야말로 우리의 귀를 한층 더 이심할만 하였건만 寺頹壁破한 오늘날에야 석양에 지나는 客의 曳履聲도 오즉 처량! 그것뿐이 아닌가! 아아! 문화의 영원하단 말도 十常八九로구나!
却說-率居란 어떤 사람인가? 그의 예술이 너머나 신비로웠던 반면에 그에 대한 문헌적 史考는 너머도 빈약하다. 이 또한 春夢式인가? 이 또한 杞宋之嘆을 연발게 하는구나!
金富軾-『三國史本傳』에는 『率居, 新羅人所出微故不記其族系 生而善畫 嘗於黃龍寺壁 畫老松 體幹鱗皴技 葉盤屈 鳥雀鳶鳶燕 往往望之飛入 及到蹭蹬而落 歲久色暗 寺僧以丹靑補之 鳥雀不復至 又慶州芬 皇寺觀音菩薩 晋州斷俗寺維摩像 皆其筆蹟世傳爲神畫』라 하였고
『東園通鑑』에는 『新羅皇龍寺成 有率居者 畫老松於壁 體幹鱗皴技葉盤屈 鳥雀往往望之飛入 及到蹭蹬而落 歲久色漫 寺僧以丹靑補之 鳥雀不復至 又芬皇寺斷俗 寺佛像 皆率居手蹟 世稱神畫』라 하였고
『東事類考』에는 『新羅率居 農家子 自幼時 志於畵樵則以蔦根劃岩 耕則以鋤尖劃沙 而僻鄕無師受 絡無以遂工 率居日夜 心祝于天神 願受神敎 如是者有年 一日有老人夢臨曰 我神人檀君 感汝至誠 授以神毫 覺來怳然 卒成名工 率居感銘神恩 畵檀君者近千本 像想其夢中所見也 高鹿李奎報 題率居所畵檀君御眞贊曰 『嶺外家家神祖像 當年半是出名工』이라 하였고
『芝峯類說』에는 『新羅眞興王時 率居者 畵老松於皇龍寺壁 鳥雀 往往飛入云 蓋其畵入神 豈獨書有金生哉 其名不顯於後世 惜哉 或言率居乃僧名』의라＜176＞ 하였고
『古*堂集』에는 『率居何妨出所徵 國史猶傳六法奇妙技不容他手補 皇龍寺壁老松枝』라는 詩絶로 嗟嘆하였다.
이것이 率居에 대한 史記다. 千篇一律式으로 모두 그저 그런 者가 있었더란다 라는 반벙어리 수작들이다. 그러나 春夢처럼 아물아물한 우리의 역사에서 다만 이만 것의 史記라도 있는 것이 도리어 다행이다.
이와 같이 率居는 어릴 때부터 至誠의 人이오 진실의 人이오 勤勉의 人이오 刻苦의 人이오 不遇의 人이엇다. 보다도 그의 소질이 超凡하였던 것도 사실이다.
『所出微故』라던가 『樵則以葛根劃岩 耕則以鋤尖劃沙』라던가 그의 貧困無雙하였던 것을 짐작할 것이며 『日夜心祝于天神 願受神敎』라는 것으로 보아 얼마나 至誠하였던 것을 엿볼 수 있으때 『蓋其畵入神』이라던가 『世稱神畵』라던가 「世傳爲神畵」라는 것으로 보아 그의 수법이 神秘境에 이르렀던 것도 사실이다.
所出의 微다. 환경의 不遇도 至誠의 천재 앞에는 다 봄눈처럼 사라지고 오즉 그의 신성한 藝術殿堂이 燦燦하였던 것이다.
아깝다. 그의 一幅의 遺畵도 얻어보지 못함이여. 率居의 *畵! 어찌 金生의 書에 비길 배*오마는 世人은 이를 書工이란 아름답지 못한 이름으로 영영 묻어버리고 말었으나 그 어찌 우리의 藝術史上 藝術界에 크나큰 손실인 동시에 一大嗟惜不己할 일이 아닐가.
다음 날 慶州루 찾는 분! 폐허이나마 黃龍寺址루 한 번 답사하실 때 率居의 神畵를 다시금 한 번 追想하여 보시기를 독자와 함께 언약하여 두는 바이다. 4, 18＜177＞
