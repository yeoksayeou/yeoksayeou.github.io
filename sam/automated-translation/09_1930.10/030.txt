Recent Collection of Letters from Imprisoned Leaders

From Hŏ Hŏn

First, to Kŏin Inhyŏng (street person respected elder brother), hearing the news of the passing of your esteemed late mother was completely unexpected and shocking. As I am far away, I cannot immediately offer my condolences in person; how could this be considered proper courtesy? Also, thank you very much for your efforts in the association's affairs. Furthermore, have you seen the previous letter sent to Teacher Sosŏk? Are all matters within the association and your household well? Please give my regards to everyone.

I hear Paengmin's illness is very critical, which is truly worrying; it would almost be better not to have heard. However, starting new construction on the ruins and then having to stop before even half a year passed, without completing the site leveling <14>, is a matter of eternal regret. But since the situation is unavoidable, please discuss it carefully, select a good successor craftsman well, apologize sincerely to the head of the household on my behalf, and since it seems my family has returned but has not yet settled on a place, please find a place for them to stay temporarily, perhaps renting monthly in Iksŏn-dong or Ch'ebu-dong among the Kŏnyangsa houses, if possible. To Mr. Pak Myŏnghwan, how have you been keeping during this season, and how engrossed have you been in the association's affairs? Thank you immensely for diligently taking care of everything in my stead. I gratefully read the letters and postcards you sent previously. Please meet Mr. Kim Ponggwan and discuss where to report the move of the office due to remaining tasks, and arrange it. Is Mr. Yi Chuyŏn coming to the capital to attend to business? I wish to know. Please give my special regards to Messrs. Pak Munhŭi and Im Sŏbong. How did the general meeting go? Was the rent paid? Are the preparations for the meeting going well? Even before my release from prison, I hope the meeting takes place for the public good. Please convey my regards to Teachers Sŏ Chŏnghŭi, Kim Chegwan, and Yi Minhaeng, and especially give my regards to all members of the Kyŏngsŏng Branch Association. My illness has fully recovered, so please understand. Forgive my omissions.
May 16th, Hŏ Hŏn respectfully

(Note = Kŏin is Mr. Kim Pyŏngno, Sosŏk = Mr. Kim Hangkkyu, Paengmin = Hwang Sanggyu. This letter came out three months after he was arrested and imprisoned for the Mass Rally incident.)

I gratefully read your letter of the 20th of this month. In this recent sweltering heat, I hope you are well. I heard in a previous letter that your health was significantly compromised and was deeply concerned. How are you these days? Please take good care of yourself. My prison life is the same as ever, which is fortunate. The preliminary writing seems likely to be concluded by the end of next month, so please understand. Are all the members also consistently healthy? Are there no obstacles in the association's affairs? I always wish to know. I don't know how Paengmin is doing and am anxious. I earnestly hope you will come for a visit. Even if you go away for the summer, I earnestly hope you will visit once before that. Please convey my regards to all members of your association.
Respectfully omitting formalities,
July 31st, 10 AM
Hyŏnjŏ-dong 101, City
Your younger brother Hŏ
P.S. I wish to meet regarding the matter of retrieving the bail money from the court, so please come quickly.

Respectfully,
How much hardship have you endured, Brother Yi? I wish to know if you have been well since then. I hope you are striving and working hard as before.
To Teachers Sosŏk and Kŏin, I cannot write separate letters. How diligently you must have worked on association affairs during this time; I am truly grateful beyond measure.
Brother Pak, are you well and vigorous? I received your recent letter. It seems you haven't yet seen my several letters. Since the long rains, I was briefly unwell with a hot-and-cold phlegm, but after continuously taking medicine for a long time, although I still don't feel refreshed, I am slightly better than before, so please do not worry at all.
The rent for the association hall needs to be paid starting next month; please speak to the treasurer. How are the association's affairs? I wish to hear about this as well.
Please tell Teacher Kŏin to send any lawyer for a visit once.
Omitting formalities,
March 8th

From Yŏ Unhyŏng

To my younger brother Hong - Not seeing you for a long time, my heart is heavy with unspoken melancholy. Today, receiving Hong'er's letter, I learned for the first time that the whole family is well, bringing comfort and joy. Elder brother is just as before, nothing much to report. Will Pong'er indeed return home before the lunar New Year? If so, bring him along. Is there still no news from the main house?

Yŏ Unhyŏng
(Note = Mr. Yŏ Unhong is his younger brother, Pong'er is his son. This letter came out shortly after he was captured in Shanghai and brought back for the Labor-Farmer Association Incident.)

Honggu, I was glad to see your letter. Studying <15> well and all the siblings being well makes me even happier. When Ponggu comes, please send in even just a bar of soap so I know the news. Father is the same as before and hasn't caught a cold. Don't worry. This is the first letter I've received from you in two months. Write often.
January 23rd
From Father

Received your letter dated September 7th on the 11th, and finally learned that you traveled back and forth safely and that the family arrives today, which puts my mind somewhat at ease. Not hearing anything for over a month, I was almost beside myself wondering what had happened. Be careful in all matters. Your elder brother is as usual. Lately, perhaps from reading fine-print English from morning till night, my eyes hurt a bit. It doesn't affect my health. Did you mention the money to be received from Messrs. Paek and Yun as mentioned in the previous letter? Please arrange all matters well.

Brother Unhyŏng

Wife,
How much trouble you must have gone through bringing the children. Coming closer and being able to rely on my younger brother, cousin, and relatives is reassuring, and my mind is at ease. I am physically strong and at ease, so don't worry at all and take care. We will meet happily before long. If a visit isn't possible soon, please write immediately about how you came so suddenly and what arrangements were made for affairs in Shanghai (money, household goods, etc.). I miss you and the children.
Ponggu, Nangu, Yŏn'gu, Honggu, Myŏnggu, all be well. I'll see you soon.
September 14th
Husband Unhyŏng

From Hong Myŏnghŭi

During this severe cold, are you living well, and is everyone in the large and small households well? I feel like I'm experiencing the first cold snap since birth. I asked for easily digestible food due to indigestion, but afterwards, pork came in, isn't that funny? I'm chewing cabbage kimchi to the point my stomach hurts, so you can imagine the state of my digestion. It would be great if you could get things like pickled raw ginger (Japanese style side dish), maybe garlic pickles, give them to the private food provider, and have them sent in. During this time, I've suffered terribly without a single book. Before buying the entomology book, send in an insect chronicle. It would be good if there's Ishikawa's lecture on zoology. Quickly buy and send one German self-study book (any kind).
Things sent in are not given even if requested (likely because they are old books). Anyway, rather than suffering ridiculously over trivial matters, if there's any way, <16> getting out even a day earlier is better, so discuss it with various friends and do it. I'm sending the poems I wrote thinking of the family during the New Year.

Thinking of Mother (思母)
Capital and countryside equally cut off, affection hindered, I cannot bow to my kind mother. Father's earnest entrustment, I dare not disobey in my lifetime.

To My Wife (贈內)
Wife, companion, and mother raising children, soot-black face replaces powdered beauty. Relying on your hard work, we barely manage a household.

To Mun (寄文)
How can literary talent be easy? It's not just about gaining empty fame. Sincerity in affairs is truly precious; one with talent must also have sincerity.

Remembering Ŭn (憶殷)
Ŭn lives far away by the East Sea, dream souls easily find him. Our family's fine children, unwilling to be mere servants.

Remembering My Daughter (憶女)
The youngest born can call 'Father', this loving child barely remembers names. Three children vividly before my eyes, a father's love is also natural affection.

Father Myŏnghŭi
Chongno 4-ch'ŏngmok 101
To be received by Hong Kimun
(Note = This letter came out shortly after his imprisonment for the Mass Rally incident, sent to his eldest son, Hong Kimun.)

The weather these days is quite warm. During this time, are you living peacefully, is everyone well, are the three children attending school well, and is Kibong starting to talk? Is everyone at the Chongno house also safe, and are their children doing well? I am getting by somehow, but my poor spirits are likely due to nervous exhaustion. Did you hear greetings from Mother? Tell her I am well and ask if there are many people fishing in the river in front.
You haven't forgotten the book I asked for last time, right? During that time, my head hurt, so I passed the days composing poems and gathering characters, but if I had even one rhyme book, I could write quite well. How can I compose without knowing the tones of the characters? The paper (조히) is scarce, so I can't even write down one poem to send. That's all.

From Kim Yaksu

While the spring cold is still harsh,
I hope your health is excellent and that all the staff inside and acquaintances outside are also well. I cannot express my deep gratitude for your efforts. My own situation is without other incident, still sitting well and contending with the passing days.
The verdict regarding me was more unexpected than anticipated, so I inevitably filed an appeal. Regarding this appeal, there is absolutely no other personal intention; please understand that it is solely for the sake of my beliefs and to clarify my position on this case as much as possible, and I hope you will further agree with my current appeal. Originally, victory or defeat is unpredictable, or rather... it might be said to be quite clear, but the reason I am appealing again despite facing such risks is entirely due to your support, Teacher. I hope for your continued support. The items sent in are still arriving well.

Kim Yaksu
Teacher Kim Pyŏngno
(Note = This is a letter he wrote the year before last, after being imprisoned for the first Chosŏn Communist Party incident.)

Teacher U Pongun! Are all of you outside well lately? I am getting along safely. Please quickly send in a copy of the recent "Asahi Yearbook" published by the Ōsaka Asahi Shinbunsha and one book on "Sociology". And one more thing, please send just 3 Won. I need to write letters occasionally to my mother in Tongnae, but I don't have money for stamps. Furthermore, I'd like to buy and read newspapers published inside here, but I need that much money. Please be sure to send the books and money within this week.

Kim Yaksu respectfully

From Chŏng Paek

Respectfully,
I am only grateful, with deep emotion, for the trouble you are taking amidst your busy schedule due to our recent public trial.
A couple of things I wish to ask: Regarding the statement in my preliminary examination decision document that I held a Communist Party Kyŏnggi Province Congress in Sŏdaemun-jŏng, city, around the end of February, Shōwa 3 (1928), you probably heard my testimony in the public trial court. Since there was absolutely no Kyŏnggi Province Congress held, if you examine the preliminary investigation statements of the defendants (who stated, like me in the preliminary decision document, that a Kyŏnggi Province Congress was held) and the statement of Yi Nakyŏng (a co-defendant) and the testimonies given in court during the trial, I believe you will know it is untrue. You probably heard Yi Nakyŏng's testimony in court on the first day of the trial. As a party member, I am prepared to receive punishment. I pray for your good health and fortune.

<14-17, 43>

**Summary**

This article presents a collection of letters written in 1930 by prominent Korean political figures imprisoned under Japanese rule: Hŏ Hŏn, Yŏ Unhyŏng, Hong Myŏnghŭi, Kim Yaksu, and Chŏng Paek. The letters, mostly sent from Sŏdaemun Prison (Hyŏnjŏ-dong 101), reveal their personal concerns about health, family well-being, and financial matters, alongside requests for books, news from the outside, and legal assistance (appeals, lawyer visits). They also touch upon the management of political organizations like Sin'ganhoe and party affairs (Communist Party, ML Party), demonstrating continued engagement despite incarceration. The most revealing aspect for historians is the intimate glimpse into the prisoners' resilience, their reliance on outside networks (family, lawyers like Kim Pyŏngno, colleagues) for support and communication, and the mundane yet vital details of prison life (requests for specific food, books, stamp money) juxtaposed with their unwavering political commitments and legal struggles against the colonial authorities.

9월 7일에 부친 편지는 11일에 接見하고 비로소 무사히 往還한 것과 가족이 今日 도착되는 것을 알게 되어 좀 맘이 노힌다. 一朔이 넘도록 하도 漠然하니 엇지 된 셈인지 궁금 미칠 듯하다. 범사에 근심하여라. 兄은 여전하다. 近頃에는 自朝至夕에 細字英文을 너무 닑어 그런지 눈이 좀 압흐다. 健强에는 관계 업네. 前書에 말한 白, 尹 兩氏에게 돈 밧을 것 말하여 보앗나 모든 일을 잘 주선하소.

그 동안 酷寒에 起居無恙하고 大小家各節一安하냐. 나는 생후 처음 치위를 격는 것 갓다. 소화불량하야 소화 잘 될 음식 부탁하라 하엿더니 그 후에는 猪肉이 들어오니 우습지 아니하냐? 배추김치를 씹어 배아틀 지경이니 소화 정도를 짐작할 듯 生강漬(일본찬) 마눌선 等屬을 구하여다 私食집에 주고 너어 드려 보내라 하면 대단 조켓다. 그동안 서적 한 권 업시 可謂 죽을 고생이다. 곤충학 사 오기 전에 곤충기 드려보내라. 石川의 동물학 강의가 잇스면 조켓다. 독일어 자습서(아무 것이라도) 속히 한 권 사 보내라.
差入한 것은 청해도 주지 안는다.(古本인 까닭인 듯) 좌우간 지질치 안흔 일에 우습진 안케 고생하는 것보담 수만 잇스면＜16＞ 一日이라도 達히 나가는 것이니 여러 친구와 의논하여 하여라. 新年에 식구 생각하고 지은 詩 명색 적어 보낸다.

근일 日氣가 제법 더웁다. 이동안 起居奉平하고 各節一安하고 세 아히 학교에 잘 다니고 起鳳 말 좀 하느냐. 鍾路 집에도 다 무고하고 제집 아히들 충실하냐? 나는 그낭 저냥 지내 가나 神氣 조치 못한 것은 신경이 쇠약한 까닭이겠지. 어머님 문안 듯자 왓느냐. 나 잘 잇고 압 江에 고기 잡는 사람 만슴니까고 나의 말슴으로 上書하여라.
요전 번 부탁한 책은 이진 것은 아니겟지. 그 동안 머리 압하서 詩名色, 字모듬으로 消日하엿는데 韻冊이라도 한권 잇스면 꽤 잘 짓겟더라. 어듸 字高低 몰라 지을 수가 잇서야지. 詩는 조히가 窮하야 한 首도 적어 보내지 못한다. 그만.

春寒이 尙險한 이때
體候運亨萬康하시고 所內 諸員과 知舊諸益이 亦得均吉乎잇가. 不任勞禱之至라 生之經過는 他故가 無하온 중에서 여전히 善坐하와 日影을 다투고 잇삼나이다.
生에게 대한 판결은 더욱 料外의 것이 잇슴으로 부득이 控訴를 제기하엿삼이다. 이 공소에 대하여는 결코 다른 私意가 업는 바이옵고 다만 저의 信條를 위함과 아울너 본건에 대한 입장을 可成的 명확히 하고저 하는 그것임을 諒察하시고 生의 금번의 공소에 더욱 동의하여 주심을 바라옵나이다. 원래로 승패는 逆賭치 못할 것이라 하기보다도... 그것이 십분 명확하다고 하겟사오나 이러한 위험을 무릅시고도 다시 공소를 하게 되는 것은 都是 선생의 애호가 게시는 까닭이오니 더욱 애호하여 주심을 바래옵나이다. 差入하시는 것은 여전히 잘 드러옵나이다.
