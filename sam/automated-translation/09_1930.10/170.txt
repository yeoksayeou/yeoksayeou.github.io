The Flavor of Fine Writing
From *Ch'unhyangjŏn*

(Excerpt from original text) At this time, the Royal Secret Inspector (御使道), his heart heavy with thoughts of Ch'unhyang, descended without delay (遲滯). When was this time? It was the 4th or 5th month, the transplanting season (移種時). Countless people (億兆蒼生 萬民) all tucked their reed raincoats (도롱이) under their arms and, wearing rush hats (갈삿갓), transplanted rice seedlings in the wide fields. The sound of transplanting songs (移秧聲) rang out loudly.

Duri-dungdung kkaengkkaengkkaengkkaeng eŏllŏllŏl sangsadio-yŏ-ŏru sangsadio.
Establishing village schools (庠序學校) and learning the teachings of the sages (聖訓) is the work of a virtuous gentleman (道德君子).
Eŏ-yŏ yŏru sangsadio
Enjoying wealth in lofty houses with red gates and peach/plum blossoms (朱門桃李) is our work.
Eŏ-yŏ-yŏru sangsadio
Amusing oneself with horse racing and cockfighting (走馬鬪鷄) among flowers and on paths (花間陌上) in late spring is the work of gallant youths (豪俠少年).
Eŏ-yŏ-yŏru sangsadio
Though there are many tasks for a man (丈夫) in the world, do we farmers (農夫) only work, eat, drink, and sleep?
Eŏ-yŏ-yŏru sangsadio
One farmer stepped forth and led a fast-paced farmer's song (자진 농가), giving the lead verse as the "Song of a Great Man's Deeds" (丈夫事業歌). <67>
Eŏ-yŏroru sangsadio
A great man (大丈夫) in the world sheds the faults of wine and women (酒色之累), holds noble aspirations, and in dealing with others (待人接物), has not a speck of selfishness (一毫私曲). Thus, speaking openly to others about all one's lifelong actions (平生之所爲事) is the work of a great man.
Eŏllŏllŏl sangsadi
Whipping a swift horse that runs a thousand li (千里駿驄) to see the famous sights of the world (天下名勝), crossing far over the seas (個海), and after achieving timeless literary fame (萬古文章), stirring the whole world (驚動一世) everywhere (到處) with powerful words and vigorous brushstrokes (雄詞健筆) is also the work of a great man.
Eŏllŏllŏl sangsadi
Becoming a leader (領袖) in society (社會), not violating the scope of the law (法律範圍), knowing oneself and others (知彼知己) in every action (一動一靜), guiding according to the situation (因其勢面導之), and reforming customs (改良風俗) is also the work of a great man.
Eŏllŏllŏl sangsadi
Gathering the nation's youth (國內青年), putting them into the educational world (敎育界), teaching (敎授) various studies (各種學問), and after cultivating talent (人材養成), becoming a master of the academic world (學界主人) is also the work of a great man.
Eŏllŏllŏl sangsadi
Donating generously without begrudging thousands in gold (不惜千金捐助) to support various societies (各社會), receiving the heaven-endowed will for love of life (天賦好生), broadly relieving (廣濟) the poor and wretched people (窮部殘民), and then becoming a charitable living Buddha (慈善活佛) is also the work of a great man.
Eŏllŏllŏl sangsadi
Researching statecraft and relief for the people (經國濟民), gaining the profits of the world (天下利益), filling the coffers (金庫に滿樍), controlling business fluctuations (商業低仰) at will, and becoming a great economist (經濟大家) is also the work of a great man.
Eŏllŏllŏl sangsadi
When managing the affairs of the world (天下事), even if one reaches the ends of the earth (地盡頭), not retreating (退步) but advancing (前進), matters will surely be successfully accomplished (事必寬成). Thus, persevering in the face of difficulty (臨難) is also the work of a great man.
Eŏllŏllŏl sangsadi <68>
Singing the song of the great man, the meaning is deep, and one feels earnest longing; the heart is heavy (畓畓), and the throat is dry.
Eŏllŏllŏl sangsadi
Let's fetch water from an icy cave's cold spring (氷穴冷泉), drink it refreshingly, and then strive for the great foundation of the world (天下大本).
Eŏllŏllŏl sangsadi
While planting seedlings for a while and drinking liquor, looking off to one side, what does one see? A farmer, carrying a hoe (홈이) on his shoulder, wearing a rush hat (삿갓), with a raincoat (도롱이) tucked at his side, has set up a charcoal brazier (질화로) with a side fire (겻불). He takes out a dog-leather tobacco pouch (개가죽쌈지), taps out powdered tobacco (가루담배) into his left palm, holds it firmly, grinds it vigorously with his thumb (엄지 장가락), pulls out the steatite pipe (곱돌대) he always keeps tucked away, fills it heaping full (담북) with the powdered tobacco, pokes it into the side fire, and puffs hard on the pipe like bellows (풀무 담배).
(From *Ch'unhyangjŏn*)

Resentful Voices Rise High (怨聲高)
Yi Mongnyong (李夢龍)

Fine wine in golden cups (金樽美酒) is the blood of a thousand people (千人血);
Jade platters of fine delicacies (玉盤佳肴) are the fat of myriad families (萬姓膏).
When the candle drips tears (燭淚落時), the people's tears fall (民淚落);
Where the sounds of song are high (歌聲高處), the sounds of resentment are high (怨聲高).

(From *Ch'unhyangjŏn*) <69>

**Summary**

This article presents two excerpts from the famous Korean narrative *Ch'unhyangjŏn*. The first is a lively depiction of farmers transplanting rice, featuring a work song (*nongbuga*) where one farmer sings about the diverse deeds of a "great man" (大丈夫), encompassing traditional virtues alongside modern ideals like social reform, education, philanthropy, and economic power. The second excerpt is a short, powerful poem attributed to the hero Yi Mongnyong, starkly contrasting the luxury of the powerful with the suffering of the common people, ending with the line "Where the sounds of song are high, the sounds of resentment are high." From a colonial history perspective, the expanded definition of a "great man's" work in the *nongbuga* to include modern social, educational, and economic leadership is particularly interesting, reflecting the changing aspirations and societal discourse in 1930s Korea under Japanese rule. The poem's theme of social critique, while traditional to *Ch'unhyangjŏn*, could easily resonate with contemporary grievances against exploitation under the colonial regime.
