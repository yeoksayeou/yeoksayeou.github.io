When the Autumn Wind Rises, the Strong Man Rises
						Kim Tong-hwan

The Terrible Calamity of Our Compatriots in North Manchuria and Ourselves

Brothers, elder and younger! The cold frost must have already fallen upon the skies of North Manchuria; what are you eating, what are you wearing these days? Knowing well that you lack even a single set of clothes, a handful of rice, the suffering of our million brethren seems visible before my eyes, and my heart aches. Ultimately, you must be covering yourselves with tree leaves (나무닙), enduring abuse from the greedy local landlords (地主) and officials (官憲). Ah, I see flocks of magpies freezing to death (凍死) on frosty nights, trying to warm themselves with their own breath.

Brothers, elder and younger, even that could perhaps be endured. Having lost even land and the protection of minimal rights (最少權力), how could we refuse such persecution (迫害) from the host country (寄遇國)? However, recent telegrams report that dozens of our brothers have been executed by firing squad (銃刑) in places like Ningguta (寧古塔), Tunhua (敦化), and Chiaoho (絞河). What terrible news (凶報) is this? As a people as meek as sheep (羊), it must have been difficult to find a pretext (口實) against them. Their household assets (家財) being utterly destitute (赤貧如洗), it must have been difficult even to covet their wealth (貪財). Then for what reason? Political reasons? As we strive not to emulate the folly (愚) of arguing right and wrong (是非) between parties not standing on equal footing (甲乙), we do not insistently wish to ask the reason. We only earnestly request (懇託) that our compatriots in Manchuria make powerful preparations (有勢한 準備) in advance to defend (防衛) against such persecution that will continue to befall them henceforth. This statement certainly does not mean preparation of military force (武力) for a people who have been disarmed (武裝解除). However, if our million brothers unite well (團結), welcome wise (叡智) leaders, and tread the right path (正途) towards acquiring the rights and interests (權益) of a collective community, there will surely be a time when light (光明) shines upon our future path. Today, mourning (吊하며) the spirits of the 15 compatriots executed by firing squad in that distant place, and hoping for much prudence from our million brothers, I shall end here.

"Minimum Sacrifice" and "Maximum Gain"

As our struggle (鬪爭) for liberation (解放) from this unprecedented poverty (貧困) and ignorance (無智) intensifies (激化) and strengthens (强大化) daily, numerous talented individuals (人材) are also sacrificed (犧牲) as its price (代價). Nevertheless, the more severe the mass misery (大衆的 悲慘) becomes, the more steadfast comrades (동무) bravely leap forward (勇躍) to their mission (任務), and seeing this increase fills us with deep emotion (感激). We truly have no other way but to offer a hundred thanks (百謝) for how much our livelihood (살님사리) is defended (防衛) and developed (發展) through their constant (不斷) guidance and activity.

However, reflecting on it, compared to the large quantity of recent sacrifices, weren't the gains (所獲) relatively small? That is, because there was perhaps some neglect (疏漏) in iron-like unity (團結), training (訓練), spiderweb-like connection (連絡), and meticulousness (綢密), weren't the gains largely nullified by the sacrifices? In any case (엇재든), let us not dwell on the past; henceforth, should we not exert our full wisdom and capacity (全智量) to achieve the "Maximum Gain" upon the "Minimum Sacrifice"? <1>

**Summary**

This editorial by Kim Tong-hwan laments the harsh conditions and recent violent persecution, including executions, faced by Korean compatriots living in North Manchuria in 1930. He expresses deep sorrow but urges against despair or rash action. Instead, he calls for strong unity, wise leadership, and strategic planning among the Korean community there to secure their rights and defend themselves through non-military means, looking towards a brighter future. The second part reflects on the broader struggle for liberation from poverty and ignorance, noting the heavy sacrifices made and questioning whether the gains have been proportionate. Kim advocates for a future strategy focused on achieving "Maximum Gain" with "Minimum Sacrifice" through better organization and meticulous planning.

From a historical perspective, this article is significant for its direct portrayal of the perilous situation of Korean migrants in Manchuria during the tumultuous pre-Manchurian Incident period, highlighting their vulnerability to both Chinese authorities and economic hardship. It reflects the nationalist sentiment and the strategic dilemmas faced by Koreans under colonial rule – the need for collective action and effective leadership, the debate over means (non-violent resistance emphasized here), and the painful calculation of sacrifice versus gain in their struggle. Historians might find the explicit call for unity and strategic planning (while disavowing armed struggle) in response to specific violent events like the executions particularly interesting.

秋風起兮丈夫起
						金東煥
北滿同胞의 凶變과 吾人
兄아, 아우야, 北滿의 하늘엔 벌서 찬서리 날렷겟는데 요지음은 무얼 먹고 무얼 입고 지내시나. 한 벌 옷, 한줌 쌀이 업슴을 잘 알매 百萬兄弟의 苦難이 눈에 보이는 듯 가슴이 압흐다. 畢境 나무닙을 덥고 그러고는 탐욕의 그곳 地主 官憲에게 학대를 밧고 안젓스리, 아하, 서리 찬 밤에 제 입김으로 제 몸을 녹이다가 凍死하고 마는 까치떼가 보임니다.
兄아, 아우야, 그것도 오히려 참으리다, 土地와 最少權力의 保護조차 이른 몸이매 寄遇國의 그만한 迫害를 마다하오리, 그러나 最近의 電報는 寧古塔과 敦化, 絞河 等地에서 數十의 兄弟가 銃刑이 되엇다 傳하니 이 무슨 凶報인고, 羊과 갓치 順한 族屬이매 口實 求하기 어려웟슬 것이요, 赤貧如洗한 家財이매 貪財하기도 困難하엿스리, 그러면 무슨 때문인고. 政治的 理由? 우리는 對等의 地位에 서지 못한 甲乙사이에 是非를 캐는 愚를 본밧지 안으려 함애 그 理由를 굿태 뭇고저 아니한다. 다만 在滿同胞에게 이 압흐로도 繼續하여 닥처올 이와갓튼 迫害를 防衛할 有勢한 準備가 미리 잇기를 懇託한다. 이 말은 武裝解除된 몸에 決코 武力의 準備를 意味하지 안는다. 그러나 百萬兄弟-잘 團結하야 叡智의 指導者를 마저서 共同生活體의 權益獲得에 正途를 밥는다면 우리의 압길에 光明이 비칠 때 잇스리라. 오늘은 먼 곳에서 銃刑된 15同胞의 靈을 吊하며 百萬兄弟의 만흔 用意를 바라고 이에 끗칠 뿐이노라.

「最少의 犧牲」과 「最大의 獲得」
前古稀有의 이 「貧困과 無智」에서 解放을 엇기 爲한 우리들의 鬪爭이 날로 激化, 强大化하여 감에 따라 數多한 人材도 또한 그 代價로 犧牲이 되어 간다. 그러컨만 大衆的 悲慘이 더욱 深刻할사록 勇躍, 그 任務에 나아가는 굿굿한 동무가 만허짐을 볼 때 吾人은 感激을 깨닷는다. 不斷한, 그네의 指導와 活動으로 우리의 살님사리가 얼마나 防衛되고 發展되어가는가하면 百謝할밧게 다른 길이 實노 업다.
그러나 생각건대 近來의 犧牲은 그 量이 컷슴에 反하야 所獲이 比較的 적지 안엇든가. 卽 鐵과 갓튼 團結, 訓練과 거미줄과 가튼 連絡, 綢密에 잇서 多少 疏漏되엿든 까닭에 所獲-思半에 犧牲이 되고 말지 엇안는가. 엇재든 過去는 뭇지 말고 압흐로 우리들은 「最小의 犧牲」 우에 「最大의 獲得」을 엇도록 全智量을 다할 것인가 하노라. ＜1＞
