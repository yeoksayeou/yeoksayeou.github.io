Samch'ŏlli Bulletin Board, Elder Gandhi Stars in Film
						Samch'ŏlli Company

Elder Gandhi attended the Indian National Congress held in Ramgarh on March 16th, expressing his resolve to resolutely push forward for the immediate independence of India. After the conclusion of the aforementioned meeting, the Elder personally took the leading role in the film "Saintly Hero Mahatma Gandhi." First, Gandhi's younger days in South Africa (南阿), where he poured the passion of his youth into fighting for his oppressed compatriots as a lawyer, were featured in close-up (大寫). However, the best part of the film was said to be the meeting with Chaplin. The film appears to be 12,000 feet (呎) long, and upon completion, it was decided it would be transported by air (空路) to Washington to be presented to President Roosevelt. According to what was heard, the film is being made into 21 international versions and is set to be screened simultaneously in India and foreign countries.<143>

**Summary**

This short news item reports that Mahatma Gandhi starred as himself in a biographical film titled "Saintly Hero Mahatma Gandhi" shortly after attending the Indian National Congress in Ramgarh in March 1940, where he reaffirmed his commitment to India's immediate independence. The film depicts his early life in South Africa and includes a meeting with Charlie Chaplin. The 12,000-foot film was planned for air transport to Washington D.C. for President Roosevelt and was being prepared in 21 versions for simultaneous international release. For historians studying Korean colonial history, this article highlights the Korean interest in international anti-colonial figures like Gandhi and global events related to independence movements, offering a glimpse into how Koreans under Japanese rule perceived and reported on such struggles elsewhere.

						삼천리사
깐디 翁은 지난 3월 16일 라므가-ㄹ에 개최된 印度 국민대회에 출석, 印度의 즉시 독립 때문에 단연 매진할 旨의 결의를 표명했는데 翁은 右會議 종료 후 영화 「聖雄 마하트마·깐디」에 친히 주역을 했다. 우선 한 변호사로서 학대받는 동포를 위해 청춘의 정열을 쏟는 南阿에서의 젊은 시절의 깐디가 大寫되였다. 그런데 同 영화 중 제일 좋은 데가 챠푸린과의 회견이였다. 同 영화는 12,000呎나 되는 모양으로 완성 하는대로 루-즈벨트 대통령에게 디릴려고 空路 와싱통에 수송되기로 되였다. 드른 즉 同 영화는 21개국版으로 되여 印度와 외국에서 동시에 상영화하기로 되있다.<143>
