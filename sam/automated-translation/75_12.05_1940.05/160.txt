**Samch'ŏlli Bulletin Board, First Korean Angel in White, Miss Sŏ Chŏng-sun, at Army Hospital**

Miss Sŏ Chŏng-sun (徐正順), 17 years old this year, residing at 1-chōme, Nishiyashaka-chō, Ōsato, Moji-shi (門司市 大里 西八坂町 一丁目), is a young woman of marriageable age. Having long desired to dedicate her maidenly passion as a subject of the imperial nation (皇國臣民) by volunteering as a nurse in white, her wish happened to be fulfilled, and she will now soon begin working at Kokura Army Hospital (小倉陸軍病院) as the first Korean "Angel in White" (白衣天使).

It is likely the first time a Korean maiden has become a nurse in any army hospital nationwide, a rare occurrence.

Miss Sŏ Chŏng-sun took the temporary nurse recruitment examination for the hospital held on March 7th, and on the 8th, she splendidly passed the exam. The hospital director, Hamada (濱田), was also greatly pleased and, deeply impressed (感敬), stated that if she wished, he would become her renowned parent. When we visited her father, Mr. Pyŏng-wan (炳完), who runs a second-hand goods store, to inform him of her passing the exam on the 8th, he spoke as follows:

"Given the current state of affairs (時局), she said she would take care of the soldiers at the army hospital, so I gave my permission."

Briefly recounting Chŏng-sun's background here: she entered the higher course at Ōsato Elementary and Higher Elementary School (大里尋高校) in Moji City, but dropped out that autumn due to the family's lack of financial means (資力). Chŏng-sun looked after her younger sister Chŏng-hŭi (正熙) and younger brother Chŏng-hun (正勳), and as a member of the Patriotic Women's Association (愛婦會員), she, along with her mother, has been guarding the home front (統後).<101>

**Summary**

This news brief reports that Sŏ Chŏng-sun, a 17-year-old Korean woman living in Moji, Japan, has passed the examination to become a nurse at the Kokura Army Hospital. She is highlighted as possibly the first Korean woman to serve as a nurse in a Japanese army hospital. The article frames her decision as fulfilling a desire to serve the "imperial nation" (Japan) during wartime, quoting her father's consent given the "current state of affairs." Her family's financial difficulties and her involvement in the Patriotic Women's Association are also mentioned. For historians, this article is interesting as it exemplifies the mobilization of colonial subjects (Koreans) into the Japanese war effort, portraying it through the lens of patriotic duty and assimilation ("imperial subject"). It also touches upon the socio-economic conditions of Koreans in Japan and the role of women's organizations in supporting the war from the home front (銃後).

三千里 揭示板, 陸軍 病院에 朝鮮人 最初의 白衣天使 徐正順孃
門司市 大里 西八坂町 一丁目 徐正順양은 금년 17살의 묘령의 처녀로 일즉부터 백의의 간호부 지원 황국 신민으로서 처녀의 정열을 다하려 하든 터에 마츰 願이 이르워저서 이제 곧 小倉陸軍病院에 朝鮮 부인 최초의 白衣天使로서 근무하게 되었다.
전국 육군병원에서도 희귀하게 朝鮮 처녀로서는 간호부가 아마 처음일 것이다.
徐正順양은 지난 3월 7일에 거행된 同병원 임시 간호부 채용시험에 수험, 팔일엔 훌륭히 시험에 파쓰되여서 濱田 同병원장도 크게 기뻐하여 본인이 희망한다면 일흠진 어버이가 되겠다고 感敬하고 있다. 8일 시험에 통과했다는 것을 알리려 고물상을 하는 父 炳完을 찾은 즉 아래와 같이 말슴했다.
본인이 시국이 시국인 만큼 육군 병원에서 병사들이 주선을 해주겠다고 하므로 나도 허락해 주었습니다.
正順의 내력을 잠간 여기에 적는다면 門司市 大里尋高校 고등과에 입학했으나 그 가을에 가정의 자력이 부족하므로 퇴학했다. 正順은 여동생 正熙 남동생 正勳군을 돌봐주며 愛婦會員으로서 그 어머니와 같이 統後를 지켜왔다.<101>
