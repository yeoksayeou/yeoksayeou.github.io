The Imperial Army, based on the Joint Defense Agreement, has now advanced into French Indochina below the equator. Truly, the 23 million Annamese people are now under the military protection of the Empire and have attained peaceful lives and livelihoods. As this much has laid the cornerstone for the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, we cannot but offer our congratulations.

However, the hostile nations Britain and America are increasingly showing their poisonous fangs, attempting to obstruct our construction of East Asia by freezing the Empire's assets in Britain and America, which is truly infuriating. Now, we, the 100 million people, must solely rely on磨ing our own strength to repel this hostility and stride forward.

Gentlemen, I believe you heard several days ago the resolution demanded of the people regarding the wartime lifestyle system from Director-General Kawagishi of the National Total Strength League (總力聯盟). Truly, as he said, at this juncture, we earnestly hope that a minimum and simplest lifestyle, no different from that of the officers and soldiers on the front lines, will be established, so that there is no disruption to the posture of national general mobilization.<93>

**Summary**

This editorial celebrates Japan's military advance into French Indochina as a step towards the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and condemns Britain and America for freezing Japanese assets. It strongly urges the populace (implicitly including Koreans as part of the Empire's "100 million people") to adopt an austere "wartime lifestyle," echoing a call by Director-General Kawagishi of the National Total Strength League, equating civilian life with that of soldiers at the front to support the national mobilization. For historians, this piece is revealing as it clearly shows the propaganda disseminated in colonial Korea during the height of Japan's expansionism. It demonstrates the attempt to integrate Koreans into the Japanese imperial narrative, justify aggression, demonize Allied powers, and enforce wartime austerity and mobilization upon the colonial subjects.

「臨戰生活」의 提唱 (最少最低의 生活을 하자)
皇軍은 共同防衛의 約定에 의하야 今에 赤道下의 佛印에까지 進駐하였으니 이 實로 2,300만의 安南人民이 帝國의 軍事的 保護下에 在하야 安住樂業을 得하였음이라. 그만치 大東亞共榮圈의 建設에 柱礎를 놓은 셈이니 吾人은 慶賀하야 마지안노라.

그런데 敵性國 英米는 益益毒牙를 더하야 帝國의 在英米 財産을 凍結하야 써우리의 東亞建設을 防害하려하니 實로 痛憤한 일이다. 이제 우리는 오직 우리 1억國民이 自力을 磨하야 그 敵性을 排擊, 邁進할 바이노라.

諸氏는 數日前 總力聯盟 川岸總長의 臨戰生活體制에 대한 國民의 覺悟를 들었슬줄 아노라. 實로 그 말슴대로 此際는 弟一線 將兵들에 다르지 안는 最低最簡易의 生活을 確立하야 國民總動員의 態勢에 어그러짐이 업기를 切切히 바라노라.<93>
