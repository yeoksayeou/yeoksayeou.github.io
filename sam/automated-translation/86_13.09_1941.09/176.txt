Anecdotes from the Literary World
						Changdaehyŏnin

Chauffeur Chu Yosŏp

This happened when the novelist Mr. Chu Yosŏp (朱耀燮氏), who formerly edited the magazine "New East Asia" (新東亞) and is now a professor at Fu Jen University (輔仁大學) in Pukkyŏng (北京), was studying abroad in America and working hard as a chauffeur for the family of a certain American actor.

One Sunday, he was planning to take a well-deserved rest, but the young lady of the master's house felt like going out and suddenly called this driver to go meet her lover. Having no choice, although it was his regular day off, Mr. Chu drove wherever the young lady wanted to go. Mr. Chu had received a letter saying a friend from Chosŏn (朝鮮) was arriving that day and was planning to go to the train station. Thinking he should quickly drop her off and head to the station, he drove at maximum speed. The young lady thought the driver was speeding out of anger because he couldn't rest, and said,
"Hey, isn't it dangerous to speed like this? What if we have an accident? Oh my, I'm getting dizzy!"
"If you're dizzy, close your eyes like me."
Hearing this, the impatient young lady, wondering if he was really driving with his eyes closed, craned her neck over his shoulder to look at Mr. Chu at the steering wheel. Indeed, his eyes were closed. The car was speeding like an arrow, and she got scared.
"Hey, stop it! Who drives with their eyes closed, not caring if they die? Gosh, there's no one as stubborn (지독한 놈) as an Oriental. How annoying."
Muttering this, she hailed another taxi and left. At that moment, Mr. Chu wasn't actually driving with his eyes closed. As everyone knows, when Mr. Chu laughs, his eyes become slits as if closed. He had laughed because he found it funny that this impatient young lady was peering over his shoulder.
Mr. Chu went straight to the train station to meet his friend. Seeing Mr. Chu driving a private car, the friend remarked, "America really has so many cars, even a poor student like you drives a private car."

Mr. Chŏng Insŏp, Good at Giving Pen Names

Once, Mr. Ko Changhwan (高長煥氏), who wrote many children's stories and was passionate about the youth movement, went to Mr. Chŏng Insŏp (鄭寅燮氏) and asked him to give him a pen name. Mr. Chŏng Insŏp thought for a moment and said,
"Your pen name should be Kŏnwi (健胃)." "Kŏnwi? What does Kŏnwi mean?" "Kŏnwi means a strong stomach (胃). Isn't your name Ko Changhwan?<160>
Kŏnwi is perfect for Ko Changhwan. That way, it becomes 'Kŏnwi Ko Changhwan' (健胃固腸丸 - a pun on a patent medicine name meaning 'Stomach-Strengthening, Intestine-Solidifying Pill')."

The Female Writer, Ch'uho Chŏn Yŏngt'aek

During the early days of the Chosŏn New Literary Movement, in the era of the pure literary magazine "Creation" (創造), which he co-led with Mr. Kim Tongin (金東仁氏), the three creators Ch'unwŏn (春園), Kim Tongin, and Chŏn Yŏngt'aek (田榮澤) emerged together like the three legs of a tripod. At that time, Mr. Ch'uho Chŏn Yŏngt'aek (秋湖 田榮澤氏), who was studying in the Theology Department at Aoyama Gakuin (靑山學院), published the short story "Spring of Life" (生命의봄) in "Creation" magazine.
The story is about a young man who finishes his theology studies in Tokyo, returns to become a pastor, and marries a woman from P'yŏngyang (平壤). The morning after the wedding ceremony, the groom goes to visit the bride in prison, where she is serving time for something that happened during her maiden days. This story is said to be based on the author's own real-life experience.
However, several years ago, this magazine published a short story by Mr. Ch'uho Chŏn Yŏngt'aek titled "Are Women Human Too?" (女子도 사람인가).
Immediately after this piece was published, the critic Im Hwa (林和氏), who wrote the "History of New Chosŏn Literature" (朝鮮新文學史), reviewed the story in the Arts section critique column of the Tonga Ilbo (東亞日報) newspaper, saying,
"I wonder which female writer (閨秀作家) the author of this novel, Ch'uho, might be."

The Hidden Struggles of Magazine Editing

During the era of Kaebyŏk Publishing Company (開闢社), which was once famous for its magazines, Mr. Ch'a Sangch'an (車相瓚氏), who was the chief editor at the time, was determined to publish an article by the now-deceased Mr. Mun Ilp'yŏng (文一平氏) in Kaebyŏk magazine. It is said that he visited Mr. Mun thirty-six times to personally collect the manuscript.

Ch'unwŏn and the Literary Youth

One day, Ch'unwŏn received a lengthy manuscript along with a letter from an unknown literary youth. The letter went something like this:
"I humbly hope that your esteemed health is ever excellent, with utmost sincerity. Thanks to your benevolent care, this humble student is well, so please rest assured. Humbly informing you, I have recently written a lengthy novel to submit to the ×× Newspaper's prize competition for long-form novels. I earnestly beseech you, Teacher, to honor it with your perusal (拜讀), and if there are any faults, please correct them so that it may win first prize."
Upon receiving this letter, Ch'unwŏn, wondering how old the sender was to ask him to "peruse" (拜讀) it, lost the inclination to "peruse" it and reportedly sent it directly to the newspaper company as it was.

The Origin of Mr. Yun Sŏkchung's Pen Name

The children's story writer Mr. Yun Sŏkchung (尹石重氏) once published a children's story in a newspaper. At that time, a printing worker mistakenly set the character 'Chung' (重) as 'Tong' (童) for Sŏkchung. Thus, the children's rhyme was published under the name Yun Sŏktong (尹石童). Ch'unwŏn, who saw this rhyme and knew it was by Mr. Yun Sŏkchung, later met Mr. Yun and said, "You've chosen a good pen name (雅號)." From then on, he was simply called Sŏktong. <161>

**Summary**

This article compiles several anecdotes about prominent Korean literary figures from the colonial period. It includes stories about novelist Chu Yosŏp's time as a chauffeur in the US, how Chŏng Insŏp humorously gave Ko Changhwan a pen name based on a pun, a case of mistaken gender identity regarding writer Chŏn Yŏngt'aek by critic Im Hwa, the persistence of editor Ch'a Sangch'an in getting a manuscript from Mun Ilp'yŏng, Yi Kwangsu's (Ch'unwŏn) reaction to an overly formal young writer, and the accidental origin of Yun Sŏkchung's pen name "Sŏktong". For historians, the article offers glimpses into the personal lives, interactions, and working conditions of Korean intellectuals under Japanese rule, including experiences abroad (Chu Yosŏp in the US), the dynamics within the literary community (pen names, critiques, editing struggles), and the blending of traditional formality with modern aspirations. The casual mention of Chu Yosŏp working as a chauffeur in the US highlights the economic hardships faced even by educated Koreans seeking opportunities abroad during this period.

自動車運轉手 朱耀燮

前日「新東亞」雜誌를 編輯하다가 지금은 北京 輔仁大學 敎授로 있는 小說家 朱耀燮氏가 米國에 留學가서 苦學으로 米國 某俳優네집 自動車運轉手로 있을 때일이다.
어느 日曜日, 마음 놓고 쉬려는데, 主人宅 令孃이 바람이 나서, 갑자기 愛人을 만나려 가려고 이 運轉手를 불러내였다. 허는수없이 朱氏는 定期休日이지만 이 令孃이 가자는데로 내달었다. 朱氏는 그날 바로 朝鮮서 친구가 온다는 편지를 받고 停車場에 가려든 차이다 어서 모셔다 들이고 停車場갈생각에 最高 速度로 내였다. 이 아가씨는 運轉手가 놀지못해 홧김에 速度를 내이는줄 알고,
「여보 이렇게 스피드를 내면 위험하지 않어요? 事故나면 어떻게 해요. 아이고 어지러워!」
「어지럽거든 나처름 눈을 감구려」
하니까, 안달방이 아가씨는 정말 눈감고 운전하는가 하고 운전대에 있는 朱氏를 어깨위로 목을 내밀고 넘겨다 보았다. 정말 눈을 감었다. 自動車는 쏜살같이 달어나는데, 그만 겁이나서
「여보 그만두서요. 저죽을줄도 몰으고 눈감고 運轉하는사람이 어데 있어요. 내원 東洋사람처럼 지독한 놈은없어.」
하고 쫑알대면서 다른 택시를 불러타고 갔다. 이때 朱氏는 정말 눈을 감고 운전한것이 아니라 朱氏는 누구나 다 아는바와 같이 웃을때에는 눈을 감은것처럼 실눈이 된다. 이때 이 안달뱅이 아가씨가 어깨위로 넘겨다 보는것이 우스워서 웃었든것이다.
朱氏는 그길로 停車場으로 친구를 맞으려갔다. 그친구는 朱氏가 自家用 自動車를 몰아가지고 나온것을 보고,「米國은 참 自動車가 만키도 하네, 자네같은 苦學生이 다 自家用自動車를 타고 다니니.」

別號잘짓는 鄭寅燮氏

한때 童話를 많이 쓰고 少年運動을 열렬히하든 高長煥氏가 鄭寅燮氏를 찾어가 別號를 하나 지어 달나고 했다. 鄭寅燮氏는 조금 생각하드니,
「자네 別號는 健胃라고 하게」「건위라니오 건위가 무슨 뜻입니까.」「健胃라고 하는것은 胃가 튼튼하다는말이지. 자네이＜160＞름이 高長煥이 아닌가.
高長煥에는 健胃가 제 格일세. 그래야『健胃固腸丸』이 아닌가」
하였다.

閨秀作家 秋湖田榮澤氏

朝鮮 新文藝運動 初創時代, 金東仁氏와함께 主宰하든 純文藝誌「創造」時代부터 朝鮮의 創作家로 春園, 金東仁, 田榮澤三人이 솟발갈이 始作하며 나려오든 時代다. 그때 靑山學院 神學部에서 工夫하든 秋湖 田榮澤氏가 短篇小說「生命의봄」을「創造」誌에 發表하였다.
그 內容은 어떤 靑年이 東京에서 神學을 마치고 돌아와 牧師가 되며 平壤어떤 女子와 結婚하였다. 婚禮式한 이튼날아츰 新婚는처녀시대 무슨일로 감옥생활하는데 新郞은 감옥으로 면회하려가는 이야기다. 이 이야기는 作者 自身의 事實을 모텔로한 小說이라고한다
그런데 수년전 本誌에 秋湖田榮澤氏의 短篇小說「女子도 사람인가」라는 글을 실었다.
이 글이 發表된 卽後에「朝鮮新文學史」를 쓴 評論家林和氏가 東亞日報 學藝欄創作評에 小說을 評하야갈아사대,
「이 小說의 作者 秋湖는 어느 閨秀作家인가 싶다」고.

雜誌編輯의 裏面苦心

한때 雜誌로 이름날리든 開闢社時代 그때 開闢社主幹이든 車相瓚氏가 지금은 故人되신 文一平氏의 글한편을 기허이 開闢誌에 실으려고 직접 原稿를 가질러 설흔여섰번을 찾어가섰다한다.

春園과 文學靑年

春園 어느날 어떤 未知의 文學靑年의 長篇原稿와 함께 편지 한 장이 왔는데 그 사연은,
「氣體候一向萬康하심을 伏慕區區無任下誠之至. 小生下念之大澤으로 無恙하오니 安心하시옵소서. 仰告小生이 近日××新聞懸償長篇小說募集하는데 보내려고 長篇小說을 한편썼사오니 先生님께서 拜讀하시고 잘못된것이 있사오면 좀 곳처서라도 一等當選되도록 하여주시기를 千萬伏望하나이다」
하였다. 이 편지를 받은 春園은 그편지보낸이가 몇살이기에「拜讀」하라 했는지몰라서「拜讀」할마음이 없어 그대로 그 新聞社로 보냈다 한다.

尹石重氏의 雅號來歷

童話作家 尹石重氏가 한번은 新聞에 童話를  發表하였는데 그때 石重이라는 것은 印刷職工이 重字를 童字로 박어놓았다 그리하여 그 童謠는 尹石童으로 發表되였다. 이 童謠를 보신 春園이 尹石重氏童謠로 알고 그후 尹氏를만나「雅號를 잘지였드군」하였다 그후부터는 그대로 石童으로부르고 말었다.＜161＞
