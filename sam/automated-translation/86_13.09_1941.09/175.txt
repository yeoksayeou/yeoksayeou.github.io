Early Symptoms and Treatment Methods for Tuberculosis, Which Often Develops When Appetite is Poor
By Okabe Taku, Doctor of Medicine

An Infectious Disease That Doesn't Feel Painful

Tuberculosis (結核), commonly called the "deficiency disease" (不足病) or "lung disease" (肺病), usually follows a chronic course compared to other infectious diseases.
That is, tuberculosis is an infectious disease where one doesn't suddenly feel sick. In the early stages of the illness, most people cannot perceive symptoms that would make them feel like they have contracted a serious disease.
Therefore, among tuberculosis researchers, it is common knowledge to consider it acute tuberculosis only when clear medical symptoms are present. Whether symptoms that could be believed to indicate recovery after treatment appear or not, medically, there is no difference.
Generally, even malignant tuberculosis initially presents latently without surface signs (陰性), so in the majority of cases, there are no definite signs prompting a visit to the doctor until the disease has progressed significantly. Thus, there are many instances where people continue to work as usual.
Since tuberculosis often progresses simply as a state of poor appetite or gastrointestinal disturbance, the need for early treatment of tuberculosis goes without saying, yet its early detection is quite difficult.

Fatigue, Decreased Appetite

Listing some symptoms that might suggest tuberculosis, especially early ones that one might vaguely recognize but not consider serious: if you find yourself less patient than usual for no particular reason, get tired more easily than others, or run a slight fever when slightly overworked even though you usually feel fine, you need to consider the possibility. Others who should be quite cautious are those experiencing, without any clear reason, some or all of the following symptoms: general malaise, a hoarse voice every morning, a persistent cough that doesn't easily subside, feeling vaguely unwell and irritable, nervousness, night sweats (盜汗), and weight loss.
If you feel fine in the morning but your head feels heavy in the evening, and you consistently run a slight fever of around 37.2 or 37.3 degrees Celsius, or if along with that, ■■ [text illegible/missing] or phlegm appears, it often indicates that even in the early stages, the disease has progressed considerably. If hemoptysis (咯血 - coughing up blood) occurs, it definitively means tuberculosis has progressed significantly. Therefore, it is imperative to detect it as early as possible before that point and prevent the disease's progression.<158>
While it's true for any illness that the earlier the treatment, the better the course and the faster the cure, tuberculosis, in particular, is easier to cure the earlier it is treated. Just as it's said that one day's delay in recuperation leads to a month's delay in recovery, if this early treatment method is thoroughly followed, treating tuberculosis is by no means difficult.

Pathogen Treatment Method

The slight fever, night sweats, loss of appetite, and gastrointestinal disturbances that tuberculosis patients suffer from day and night (晝夜) are caused by the action of tuberculosis bacterial toxins. Although the tuberculosis bacterium mainly attaches to the lungs and does not directly stimulate the heat center, sweat center, or gastrointestinal tract, it continuously secretes a type of toxin. When this toxin acts on the vagus nerve (迷途神經), it causes loss of appetite. When it acts on the gastric mucosa, gastric juice secretion decreases, impairing the overall digestive function of the gastrointestinal tract and making nutrient absorption difficult.
Because of this, the patient's nutrition declines, and the whole body gradually becomes emaciated and weakened.
Therefore, in treating tuberculosis, one must first eliminate the loss of appetite and gastrointestinal disturbances that worsen the nutritional state. However, since these are phenomena caused by the tuberculosis bacterial toxin, simple digestive aids or appetite stimulants have the regrettable limitation that their effect disappears when the medication wears off, failing to address the root cause of the symptoms. But "Wakamoto" (와까모도), a complex medicinal yeast preparation and the only one of its kind in our country (我國), is different from simple gastrointestinal medicines. It fundamentally eliminates the patient's loss of appetite and gastrointestinal disorders while simultaneously supplying abundant nutrition and increasing the phagocytic action (喰菌作用) of white blood cells, weakening the activity of the tuberculosis bacteria. Thus, it is most ideal as a tuberculosis treatment agent.

Why Does "Wakamoto" Work Well?

That is, "Wakamoto" exhibits a special action called cell protoplasm activation (細胞原形質賦治作用) through the combined effect of vitamin B complex, which it contains in the highest amount among natural substances and has the highest utilization rate in the human body, and three digestive enzymes (starch-digesting enzyme, protein-digesting enzyme, fat-digesting enzyme). It first aims to strengthen the gastrointestinal tract, invigorates gastrointestinal functions such as digestion, nutrient absorption, and stool elimination (排池), thus securing the primary line of nutrition.
Furthermore, it supplements protein, calcium, glycogen (구리고-젠), fats, etc., which are often deficient in patients, thereby enriching nutrition and invigorating overall life functions. On the other hand, it also contains components such as flavin (후라빈) which neutralizes tuberculosis bacterial toxins, nuclease(?) (누구레닌) which increases white blood cells and enhances phagocytosis, lipase (리빠-제) which dissolves the capsule of the tuberculosis bacterium, and "kurikokinin"(?) (구리고기닌) which even has the nickname "appetite element" (食慾素). By enhancing natural healing power and strengthening resistance to disease, the condition gradually improves, and healing is promoted. Therefore, it can be said to be the most suitable medicine for the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis.
"Wakamoto" is sold cheaply at 1 Won 60 Chŏn for a 25-day supply and 5 Won for an 83-day supply (sold at regulated prices depending on the region). It is distributed throughout Korea (全鮮) from the Wakamoto Honpo Chōsen Eigyōsho (와까모도 本舖朝鮮營業所) at 195 Yŏngŏn-chŏng, Kyŏngsŏng-bu (京城府蓮建町一九五番地) (Postal Transfer Kyŏngsŏng 10738). For regional orders, shipping costs are covered (送料負擔), and express delivery is provided. It is also available at pharmacies throughout Korea (全鮮各藥店).<159>

**Summary**

The article, written by Dr. Okabe Taku, describes the subtle early symptoms of tuberculosis (TB), such as fatigue, low fever, poor appetite, and irritability, emphasizing that TB often develops unnoticed until it's advanced. It stresses the critical importance of early detection and treatment. The latter half explains that TB toxins cause symptoms like poor appetite and digestive issues, hindering nutrition. It then heavily promotes "Wakamoto," a yeast-based supplement, claiming it uniquely addresses the root cause by improving digestion, supplying nutrients (vitamins, enzymes, protein, etc.), and boosting the immune system (increasing white blood cells, containing toxin neutralizers) to fight TB bacteria, thereby promoting natural healing.

From a historical perspective, the article is interesting as it reflects medical understanding and public health concerns about TB (a major killer) in colonial Korea during WWII. It notably features a Japanese doctor providing health advice to a Korean audience. Most revealing is the seamless integration of an advertisement for a Japanese product, "Wakamoto," presenting it not just as a supplement but almost as a specific treatment for TB, highlighting commercial interests intertwined with public health messaging in the colonial era. The claim that Wakamoto is the "only one of its kind in our country (我國)" is ambiguous – referring potentially to the Japanese Empire including Korea, or just Japan.

밥맛업슬때에 好發하는 結核의 初期症狀과 治療法
						醫學博士 岡部卓

아프지않은 傳染病

俗稱으로 不足病 또는 肺病이라고 하는 結核은 다른 傳染病에 比較하여 普通慢性의 經過를 밝습니다.
卽 結核病은 갑자기아프거나 그렇지 않은 傳染病으로 病이 早期에있어서는 大部分무슨 大端한 病에걸린것같은 症狀을 自覺할수가없습니다.
따라서 結核硏究家間에서는 明白한 醫學的症狀이 있을때는 急性의 結核이라고봄이 常識이되여있습니다 가령 治療를하여서 恢復하였다고 믿을수있는 症狀이일어나든 안일어나든 醫學的으로는 何等變化는 없습니다.
大槪 惡性의 結核이라고 最初는 普通表面에 徵候가나타나지않는 陰性이여서 大多數는 病이 大端히 進行하기까지는 醫師를 찾어 뵈어야할 確實힌 徵候가없음으로 普通 從前과같이 일을하고있은 例가 많습니다.
單純한 食慾不振이라든가 胃障障碍의 狀態로서 結核이 進行하는수가 적지아니함으로 結核의 早期治療의 必要는더말할것도 없어도 그 早期發見이 여간어려운일이 아닙니다.

疲勞食慾減退

結核에걸린것같은 症狀 더구나 自己로는 알뜻하면서는 大端하다고는 生角되지않는 初期의 症狀을 몇가지들어보면 무슨 病이있는것도아닌데 어쩐지 忍耐性이 적어지고 다른사람보다도 疲勞하기쉽고 또 平素는 아무렇지도않으면서 조곰 過勞하면 微熱이있고하는분은 한번 疑心하여 볼 必要있가습니다. 其他 全身의 倦怠 每日아침목이쉬고 容易히 끝이지않은기침 어쩐지마음이 不快하고 짜징이나고 神經이 過敏해지며 盜汗 體重減少等의 症狀中몇가지 或은 全部가 아무런 理由도없이 있는분도 相當히 注意하실 必要가있습니다.
아침은 氣分이 좋으나 저녁때가되면머리가무겁고 三十七度二三分쯤의 微熱이 定해놓고 있다든가 그와 同時에 ■■라든가 痰이나오게되면 初期라도 相當히 進行하고있는 例가많고 거기에 咯血이있으면 確定的으로 結核이 相當히 進行하고 있는것입니다. 그러므로 되도록 그 以前에 發見하여 病의 進行을 앞서막지 않으면 안됩니다.＜158＞
如何한 病이라도 治療가 빨으면 빨을수록 經過도좋고 治癒도 빨을것입니다만 特히 結核은 早期면 早期일수록 治癒되기 쉬운 것으로 養生이 一日처지면 一個月恢復이처진다고 하는만큼 이 早期治療法만 徹底하면 結核의 治療는 決코 困難한것이아닙니다.

病原治療法

結核患者가 晝夜로 苦心하는 微熱盜汗 食慾不振 胃障障碍는 結核菌毒素의 作用에의해서 일어나는것입니다. 結核菌은 主로 肺에붙는것으로서 直接熱中樞라든가 盜汗中樞라든가 胃腸을 刺戟하는것은 아닙니다만 끌이지않고 一種의 毒素를 分泌하여 그것이 迷途神經이 作用하면 食慾不振이되고 胃粘膜에 作用하면 胃液이 減退하여 全體的으로 胃腸의 消化機能을 害하여 榮養의 吸收를 困難케합니다.
그 때문에 患者에 榮養은 低下하고 全身은차츰 야위고 衰弱하는것입니다.
그러므로 結核治療에 當해서는 무엇보다도 먼저 榮養狀態를 不良하게하는 食慾不振이라든가 胃障障碍를 除하지않고는 안됩니다만 아무런 結核菌毒에의해서 일어나는 現像임으로 單純한 消化劑라든가 食慾增進劑로는 藥이떨지자 藥效도떠러짐으로 病症의 發生하는 根源을 누질을수없는 遺憾한 點이있읍니다만 複合藥用酵母劑로서 我國唯一의 製劑인「와까모도」는 단순한 胃腸藥과는달라서 患者의 食慾不振이라든가 胃障障碍를 根本的으로 除함과 同時에 榮養을 豊富히 供給하고 白血球의 喰菌作用을 增殖하여 結核菌의 活動을 衰하게하는 優秀한 作用이있음으로 結核治療劑로서는 가장 理想的입니다.

「와까모도」는 왜잘듯나

卽「와까모도」는 天然物中隨一의 含有量을 保有하고 人體에가장 利用率의 높은비타민B複合體와 三消化酵素(澱粉消化酵素, 蛋白質消化酵素脂肪消化酵素)와의 複合效果에 依해서 所謂細胞原形質賦治作用이라고하는 特殊의 作用을 뵈이고 먼저 胃腸의 强化를꾀하며 消化라든가 榮養의 吸收 便의 排池等胃腸의 作用을 活潑히하여서 榮養第一線을 確保합니다.
그우에 病者에 不足하기쉬운 蛋白質 칼슘을비롯하여 구리고-젠 脂肪等을 複給하여 榮養을充分히하고 全生活機能을 旺盛히합니다만 또 一面結核菌의 毒素를 解消하는후라빈 白血球를 增殖하여 喰菌作用을 높이는누구레닌 結核菌被膜을 녹이는 리빠-제 食慾素의 別名까지있는 구리고기닌等의 成分들도 含有하여 自然治療力을 높이면서 抗病力을 强化식힘으로차츰 病勢는 好轉하고 治癒를 促進시키는고로 結核의 豫防 治療에는가장 好適한 藥이라고할수있습니다.
「와까모도」는 二十五日分 一圓六十錢八十三日分五圓 (地方에따라서 協定價格으로 販賣)이란 廉價로 京城府蓮建町一九五番地 와까모도 本舖朝鮮營業所(振替京城 一〇七三八番)에서 全鮮에 發賣되고있는데 地方注文에는 送料負擔코 急送하여드리는데 全鮮各藥店에도 있습니다.＜159＞
