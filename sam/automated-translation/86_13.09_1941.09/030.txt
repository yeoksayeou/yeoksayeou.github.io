Article Type: 論説 (Editorial/Opinion Piece)

Responding to the fervent request of your esteemed magazine "Samch'ŏlli," I send this rough piece focusing on the situation around Shanghai to the people of the Peninsula. Truly, since the outbreak of the China Incident, the patriotic fervor of our Peninsula compatriots has surged powerfully. In response to this, when the Peninsula Youth Volunteer Soldier system was implemented in April of Showa 13 (1938), devoted Peninsula youths successively volunteered through police stations across all of Korea. Just one week after the Special Volunteer Soldier Ordinance was enacted, the total number surpassed 3,000, reaching about five times the recruitment quota of 400, deeply moving the authorities. Accompanying the progress in the Korean people's level of civilization and popular sentiment, the volunteer soldier system was permitted for Peninsula people. Through this, the aim was to provide training as subjects of the Imperial Nation and have them contribute to the defense of Japan and Korea as one body (内鮮一體). They were selected and recruited, and their post-recruitment status, treatment, and military service were made identical to those of conscripts from the mainland. Since then, with the prolongation of the Incident into a long-term war, the unity and solidarity between the mainland and the Peninsula have been increasingly strengthened. Burning with supreme patriotic sentiment, the youth of the Peninsula, as honorable members of the Imperial Army, are fighting bravely on the Chinese continent, carving out numerous brilliant military achievements. Demonstrating service completely equal to that of the youth from the mainland, they are still, undeterred by the blazing heat, making the hot blood of Peninsula manhood boil over on the very front lines.

Especially in the recent Central Plains Operation—a major operation that completely encircled and annihilated the 200,000 regular troops of the enemy's First War Area under Wei Lihuang, which had been entrenched in southern Shanxi Province for several years and served as a base for disturbing the peace in North China, thereby cutting out the cancer threatening North China's security—our forces achieved a great military success, leaving behind brilliant <28> military exploits worthy of special mention in the annals of the Imperial Army, suffering 600 casualties against approximately 50,000 enemy bodies abandoned on the field, about 30,000 prisoners of war, and over 8,000 captured officers including army commanders, division commanders, and chiefs of staff. It is a source of deep emotion and gratitude for us that soldiers originating from the Peninsula displayed numerous tales of bravery during this operation. Unfortunately, there is a sense that the meritorious deeds of soldiers from the Peninsula on the front lines tend to be overlooked by journalism. However, a war correspondent who recently returned from this operation told me, "Far from being inferior to soldiers from the mainland, the soldiers from the Peninsula are fighting bravely as truly fine, more-than-capable soldiers. It is indeed most reassuring."

Meanwhile, even on the battlefields of the continent, we frequently hear, through newspapers, magazines, pamphlets, and other materials, about the beautiful stories and praiseworthy tales from the home front within the Peninsula. An 18-year-old Peninsula girl donated sixteen yen and eighteen sen along with a note saying, "This money is what I earned by making and selling desk covers, dolls, etc., so it's really very little, but please, use it somehow for the soldiers working hard in the war zone. I beg you." A 16-year-old boy engaged in road construction, supporting his elderly parents with his meager wages, was moved by a neighborhood chief's talk on the current situation and, wanting to work for the country even for just one day, brought his next day's wage of fifty sen, requesting that it be donated. Knowing the family's financial situation, the ward chief initially tried to dissuade him, saying, "I will report your sincere heart to the neighborhood chief," but due to his strong insistence, the donation procedure was carried out. Also, a deaf man, upon returning home from work, was ashamed that he could not participate in the village donation drive because he was away while all other villagers had contributed. He scolded his wife for her thoughtlessness in not donating at the time, went himself to the police substation, explained the situation through his wife's interpretation, apologized for the delayed donation, and presented two yen, deeply moving the personnel. Besides these, across the entire Peninsula, beautiful stories and praiseworthy tales of Japan-Korea unity on the home front—such as one-lamp/one-sen donations, "barbershop patriotism" (バリカン報國), bamboo tube donations, smoke-saving donations, etc.—are blooming profusely, and the officers and soldiers on the front lines are profoundly grateful and moved by the utmost sincerity and fervent patriotism of the Peninsula people.

The surging patriotism of the Peninsula people is not confined solely within the Peninsula; wherever Peninsula compatriots reside—be it the mainland, Manchuria, North China, or Central China—it manifests as acts of devoted service to the nation, no different from those of the mainland Japanese: donations, collection of comfort items for the Imperial Army, movements to understand the current situation, prayers for victory, making thousand-stitch belts (千人針), and so forth. Particularly in the field, the fact that they have organized special volunteer corps to cooperate with the Imperial Army, even to the point of suffering fatalities, is already known to all. At the Harbin Normal School, when sixth graders and first-year high school students were once asked to respond to questions related to the current situation, to the question "What kind of resolve have you had as citizens on the home front?" there were brave responses like "Resolve to charge forward when the time comes," and "If the soldiers die, I want to grow up and take their place." Also, to the question "Why does Japan win?" the answer was "Because our weapons are domestically produced and the Yamato spirit (大和魂) resides within them," responses based on an awareness as citizens of Japan and an understanding of the current situation, which is truly impressive. Furthermore, a passage from a letter sent by a certain motorcycle driver serving with the XX unit in North China to his wife back in Korea reads:
"While active on the front line, I was wounded in the right ear by an enemy bullet, but it is not life-threatening, so rest assured. I am enclosing forty yen from my salary and a photograph, so look at the place where I was wounded. I don't know when I might die in battle, but I intend to risk my life and work for the sake of our country, so you too, please take care of your health and live well." What tragic yet admirable resolve is this? Also, a Peninsula sailor, permitted to work on a government-chartered ship, leaps at the chance, believing "Now is the time for service!" His written impressions deeply moved the relevant authorities: "I know that there have been fierce battles many times until today in North China, Central China, and South China. Each time, I thought of my own situation and felt nothing but regret. It was because, being from the Peninsula, I could not go to war. However, my wish has now been granted, and starting today, I have become a crew member of a government-chartered ship. My heart is full of joy. When I saw the Chinese laborers working on our ship during unloading in North China becoming attached to the Japanese soldiers and looking up to them like parents, I came to believe that righteous Japan will eventually raise a victory song and secure peace in East Asia."

Come to think of it, four full years have passed since the outbreak of the China Incident. The Empire's handling of the Incident proceeds according to the established policy, with the two major objectives remaining the destruction of the anti-Japanese regime and the fostering of the newly emerging National Government. The Chongqing regime, due to the valiant struggle of the Imperial Army, is increasingly reaching the extremes of exhaustion and seems to be at the stage where "just one more push" is needed.

However, due to China's unique characteristics, we must be prepared for the fact that considerable time will still be required until its collapse is witnessed. If we ask about the results of our war in the China Incident, anyone would think of that vast occupied territory and the great blow dealt to the enemy. Let's try comparing the war results of the German army, which is the object of praise from the whole world, with our own war results. Since the start of the war, the German army succeeded in Blitzkrieg operations one after another in Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Yugoslavia, Greece, etc., and in just one year and seven or eight months, they would have captured an area of 1.3 million square kilometers and forced about six to seven million enemy soldiers to surrender. In contrast, our army, since the outbreak of the China Incident until the capture of the Wuhan Three Towns in October of the following year (Showa 13), a period of one year and four or five months, occupied approximately 1.56 million square kilometers of mainland China and inflicted losses of over two to three million on the enemy, thus achieving results even greater than Germany's Blitzkrieg. Why then is the China Incident still unresolved? A major reason lies in the fact that it is a battle against the vast nature of China itself. Whereas if Germany occupied 1.3 million square kilometers, there would be no room left for the enemy to exist, China's total area is 10 million square kilometers [Note: figure likely inaccurate, but reflects the author's perception of scale], meaning our vast occupied territory amounts to merely sixteen or seventeen percent. This is why the Chiang anti-Japanese regime can still survive.<30>

The above is a view of the Imperial Army's war results in terms of territory. However, we must not forget that the Imperial Army's war results here are not merely because the physique of Japanese soldiers is superior or because their equipment is superior, but rather because their *spiritual strength* (精神力) was superior. Our officers and soldiers possess a strong spiritual power, a belief that they will definitely win against the enemy. This soul is what enables them to march through over four hundred provinces and win battles. This soul is what allowed them to break through those muddy roads and push across those creeks to conquer numerous strong fortifications. No matter how difficult a battle begins, from the commander above down to the lowest private, there is an absolute, unshakable conviction: "How could we possibly lose to the Chinese army?" The battlefield is won by the one who endures for the last five minutes. Millions of officers and soldiers who have undergone this precious experience of human spiritual strength have now been forged in our country. Isn't this reassuring? They are truly the veterans of many battles, building the New Order in East Asia (東亞新秩序). Our national spirit, which had been eroded by the corrupting influences of Western culture since the First World War, has been greatly corrected by this Incident. What else could this be but a great war result?

It goes without saying that the words "our" and "we" used up to this point in my writing include our Peninsula compatriots. Now is the season when Peninsula compatriots must pour out patriotic fervor equal to that of the mainland Japanese and push forward towards the completion of the Empire's greatest mission: resolving the China Incident and constructing the Greater East Asia New Order.

To all our Peninsula compatriots! Let us tighten our loincloths (褌) once more and persevere strongly through the fire!<31>

**Summary**

The article, written by a Japanese army officer in 1941, praises the supposed patriotic fervor of Koreans ("Peninsula compatriots") supporting Japan's war effort in China. It highlights Korean participation in the volunteer soldier program, bravery on the battlefield (citing the Central Plains Operation), and enthusiastic home front support through donations and morale-boosting activities across Korea and wherever Koreans reside (Japan, Manchuria, China). The author emphasizes the "Japan-Korea as One Body" (Naissen Ittai) ideology, compares Japan's military achievements favorably to Germany's, attributes success primarily to superior Japanese "spiritual strength," and concludes with a call for Koreans to redouble their efforts alongside the Japanese for the Empire's mission.

For historians, this article is a significant example of Japanese wartime propaganda aimed at mobilizing Korean support and reinforcing the *Naissen Ittai* policy. It selectively presents anecdotes to construct a narrative of unified imperial loyalty, downplaying colonial oppression and resistance. The explicit comparison with Nazi Germany's military success and the emphasis on spiritual superiority over material factors offer insights into Japanese wartime ideology and self-perception. The piece reveals the pressure and expectations placed upon Koreans to demonstrate loyalty during a critical phase of the war.

戰場と半島同胞の愛國熱
						陸軍少尉 松田盛太(支那派遣軍上海報道部部員)
貴誌「三千里」の熱誠に應へ現地上海を中心とした粗雜なこの一文を半島民衆へ送る。實に支那事變勃發以來澎湃として高まつた、我が半島同胞の愛國熱に應へて、昭和十三年四月半島靑年志願兵制度が實施されるや、全鮮に亘つて誠心こめた半島靑年が續々各地警察署を通じて志願し、特別志願兵令が實施せられて僅か一週間の期間に總數三千名を突破し、採用人員四百名に對し約五倍の多數に達し、當局を感激させたものである。朝鮮の民度民情の進展に伴ひ、半島人に對しても志願兵制を許可し、之に依つて皇國臣民たるの鍛鍊を加へ、内鮮一體の國防に寄與させる目的で選拔採用し、採用後の身分取扱及ぶ服役は内地人の徴集兵と同樣にする事となつた。爾來事變の長期戰化に伴ひ、內鮮一致團結は益々强化され愛國の至情に燃え立つ半島の靑年は、名譽ある皇軍の一員として支那大陸に勇猛奮戰、幾多の赫々たる武勳を刻み、內地の靑年に寸毫も劣らない御泰公を盡して今尙ほ炎熱を物ともせず最前線に半島男子の熱血を沸き返へしてゐる。
特に今次中原作戰―山西省南部に數年來蟠居し北支治安攪亂の根據であつた敵第一戰區衛立煌二十萬の正規軍を完全に二重包圍し、これを殲滅し北支治安の癌を切取つた大作戰では我が六百の損害に對し敵の遺棄死體約五萬、捕虜約三萬、また軍長、師長、參謀長らの捕虜八千餘名に達する大戰果を擧げ、皇軍戰史に特筆ベき赫＜28＞々の武勳を殘したが、本作戰に當り半島出身の兵士は幾多の武勇傳を發揮してゐる事は吾人の感激感謝する所である。最前線に於ける半島出身兵士の手柄話は不幸にしてジヤーナリズムから見落され勝となつてをる感があるが、今次作戰から歸來した一從軍記者は、「半島出身兵士は内地出身の兵隊に劣るどころか、實に立派な一人前以上の兵隊として勇敢奮戰してゐる。誠に賴もしい限りである」と自分に話してゐた。
一方大陸の戰野にあつても、半島內に於ける銃後の美談佳詁は新聞雜誌パンフレツト其他の資料により吾々の耳に入る事は大變多い。十八歲の半島少女が「此のお金は私が机掛や人形等を作つて賣つたお金ですから本當に少いんですけど、何卒戰地で働いて下さる兵隊さん方へお役に立てて下さいませ、御願致ます」と十六圓十八錢を添へ恤兵獻金をしたり、十六歲の少年が道路工事に從事し、其の僅少なる勞銀を以て老ひたる父母を養つてゐるが、面長の時局談に感激し一日でも國の爲に働いて見たいと其の翌日の勞銀五十錢を持參獻金方を願出でたるを以て同家の家計を知る區長は「君の眞心は面長にも報告するから」と一應押止めたが、强つての願に獻金手續を取つたさうである。又一啞者が施行より歸宅したところ、村民が全部獻金してゐるに拘らず、留守の爲之に參加し得なかつた事を恥ぢ、妻に當時獻金しなかつた不心得を責め、自ら警察官駐在所に出頭妻の通譯により右の次第を述べ獻金の遲れたるを謝し二圓を差出して所員に感動を與へた。其の他一燈一錢獻金、バリカン報國、竹筒獻金、節煙獻金等々全鮮に亘り銃後に於ける內鮮一體の美談佳話は咲誇り、前線將兵は半島人の愛國の至誠熱情に痛く感謝感激してゐるのである。
澎湃として起つた半島人の愛國心は啻に半島內のみに止らず、內地、滿洲、北支、中支をはじめ苟くも半島同胞の在る所或は獻金、皇軍慰問品醵出、時局認識運動、戰勝祈願、千人針等内地人に變らない赤誠報國の行爲となつて現はれ、特に現地にあつては特別義勇隊を組織して皇軍に協力し、戰死者までも出すに至つたことは旣に人皆の知る所である。ハルビン普通學校で嘗て六年生及高等一年生に對し、時局に關する課題に答へさせたところ「銃後國民として如何なる覺悟をして來たか」の問に對し「いざと云ふ埸合は向つて行く覺悟」「兵隊さん逹が死んだら僕は大きくなつて其の代りになり度い」等勇ましいものがあり、又「日本は何故勝つか」の問に對し「武器が國産で其の中に大和魂が籠つてゐるから勝つ」等と何れも日本國民としての自覺に基ふ時局の認識ある答であり流石と感心させられる。又北支○○部隊從軍オー＜29＞トバイ運轉手某が朝鮮に殘つた妻に宛てた手紙の一節に曰く、
「自分は第一線に活躍中右耳を敵彈に負傷したが、生命に別條はないから安心せよ。此處に月給中より四十圓と寫眞を同封して送るから自分の負傷の箇所を見なさい。自分は何時戰死するかも知れないが、身命を堵して御國の爲に働く積りだから御身も身體を大切に暮しなさい」何と悲壯な見上げた覺悟ではないか。又一半島船員は御用船に働く事を許され、御奉公は此の時と許り勇躍任務について居るが、その感想文は痛く關係當局を感激させてゐる。「今日に至る迄何回となく北支、中支、南支で激戰があつた事は自分等にも判つてゐます。私はその度に自分の身の上を顧み殘念でなりませんでした。其は半島出身故に出征出來ない爲だつたのです。處が今回願が叶つて、今日から御用船の組員になりました。喜びで胸が一杯です。北支の荷揚の際本船で働く苦力が日本の兵隊樣になついて親の如く慕ふのを見た時、正義日本に軈て凱歌が揚り東洋平和を確保することを信ずる次第であります」
惟へば支那事變が勃發してこゝに滿四年を迎へた。帝國の事變上處理は旣定方針通り依然として抗日政權の潰滅と新興國民政府の育成の二大目的を以て進められてゐる。重慶政權は皇軍の奮戰によりて愈々窮乏を極めつゝあり、「今一押し」と云ふ段階にあるものと思はれる。
然し支那の特性からして之が潰滅を見る迄には未だ相當の日月を要するものと覺悟しなければならない。支那事變の我が戰果如何と云へば、誰しもあの廣大なる占領地域敵に與へたる大なる打擊を考へるであらう。全世界から稱讚の的となつてゐる獨逸軍の戰果と、わが戰果とを比較して見ることゝしやら獨逸軍は開戰以來、ノルウエー、デンマーク、オランダ、ベルギー、フランス、ユーゴー、ギリシヤ等次から次へと電擊作戰に成功し、僅か一年七、八ケ月の間に面積としては百三十萬平方粁、敵兵力としては約六、七百萬を降伏せしめたことにならう。之に對し我が軍は支那事變勃發以來翌十三年十月武漢三鎭占領一年四、五ケ月の間に支那本土約百五十六萬平方粁を占領し、敵二三百萬以上の損害を上へて居り、獨逸の電擊戰以上の戰果を收めてゐる。然るに今尙ほ支那事變が解決し得ざるは何故であらうか。それは支那の廣大なる自然との戰ひであるところに大きな原因がある。獨逸は百三十萬平方粁を占領すれば敵の存在する餘地すらないのに比べ、支那の全面積は一千平方粁で我が廣大なる占領地域も僅か一割六、七分に過ぎないことになる。玆に今尙蔣抗日政權が餘喘を保つ事が出來る譯であ＜30＞る。
以上は地域的に見た皇軍の戰果であるが、こゝの皇軍の戰果は日本軍の體力が優秀であり、器材が優秀であつたからであると云ふより、實はその精神力が優れて居たからであることを忘れてはならない。敵に對し我が將兵は必ず勝つと云ふ强い精神力を持つてゐる。この魂が四百餘州を步かせ戰ひに勝たせてゐるのである。この魂があの泥濘の路を究破し、あのクリークを押し渡つて幾多の堅陣を屠り得たのである。どんな困難な戰鬪が始つても上は指揮官より下は一兵に至るまで誰が支那軍に負けてたまるものかと云ふ絕體不動の信念がある。戰場は最後の五分間を持ちこたへる者が勝つ。この人間精神力の尊い體驗を經た將兵が、我が國には今や數百萬出出來上つた。賴もしいではないか。正に東亞新秩建設の歷戰の戰士である。前歐洲戰爭以來歐米文化の餘ん弊に蝕れたわが國民精神力もこの事變によつて大いに是正せられた。これは大いなる戰果でなくて何だらう。
自分が玆まで書いた中の「我が」、「我々」等の言葉の中には半島同胞も含まれてゐる事は勿論である。今や半島同胞は內地人に劣らない愛國の熱情を傾け支て那事變處理大東亞新秩序建設と云ふ帝國最大大使命遂行に邁進しなければならない秋である。
半島同胞の皆樣よ！一つ褌を緊めなほして火いに頑張らうではありませんか。＜31＞
