The Origin of the Legendary Thousand-Day Wine
						by T'aebaek Sanin

Chŏk Hŭi (狄希) was a man from Chungsan County (中山縣) who made Thousand-Day Wine (千日酒). This was a strange wine, unique throughout all ages, such that if one drank it once, one would be intoxicated for a thousand days. At that time, Hyŏn Myŏngsŏk (玄名石), who lived in Yu Chu (有州), greatly enjoyed alcohol and was literally a heavy drinker (酒豪) who wouldn't refuse a *mal* (斗) of wine a day. Although he had drunk various kinds of wine, after drinking any of them, he would always end up searching, asking if there wasn't a better wine. When he heard the story of this Thousand-Day Wine, he rushed like an arrow to Chŏk Hŭi's house to obtain some. Chŏk Hŭi said, "My wine is not yet sufficiently ready to drink."

Being a veritable demon for drink, Hyŏn Myŏngsŏk wanted it even more precisely because it wasn't ready. "Anything is fine. Just one cup is fine. Give me one cup," he begged. Chŏk Hŭi refused again and again, but Hyŏn Myŏngsŏk wouldn't listen.

"I don't care what happens," he said, so Chŏk Hŭi had no choice but to give him some under the condition of "just one cup." Hyŏn Myŏngsŏk returned home bravely and, upon quickly drinking the one cup, immediately stiffened and died right there. His family members, knowing nothing, wept and buried him just as he was. After that, three years passed. Chŏk Hŭi remembered the wine he had given to Hyŏn Myŏngsŏk and went to visit his house. When he asked the family members about Hyŏn Myŏngsŏk's well-being, they looked at him strangely and said, "Hyŏn Myŏngsŏk already died. It's already been three years."

Chŏk Hŭi was startled.

"That must be because of the wine. Since he drank the wine that makes one sleep for a thousand days, he wouldn't have died. Today is exactly the day that the effect of the wine wears off."

Chŏk Hŭi went with the family members to the grave where Hyŏn Myŏngsŏk was buried. Upon arriving, the top of the grave mound was damp with moisture (水氣), as if it were sweating. They dug up the grave and opened the coffin, and just then, it was precisely the time for Hyŏn Myŏngsŏk to sober up. Hyŏn Myŏngsŏk opened his eyes and mouth and shouted loudly.

"Ah, that felt really good! Really good. That's truly fine wine. But I have no idea how long I slept."

Hearing this, the people above the grave all laughed. When they pulled Hyŏn Myŏngsŏk out of the coffin, the smell of alcohol still emanating fiercely from his body stung the nose. It is said that it took three months for Hyŏn Myŏngsŏk to return to his original state.<105>

**Summary**

This article recounts the legend of "Thousand-Day Wine" (Ch'ŏnilchu), supposedly brewed by Chŏk Hŭi. A heavy drinker named Hyŏn Myŏngsŏk eagerly consumes an unfinished cup despite warnings, appears to die, and is buried. Three years later, Chŏk Hŭi realizes the wine's effect should be wearing off. They exhume Hyŏn Myŏngsŏk, who awakens precisely then, praising the wine and unaware he has "slept" for three years. The story highlights the potency of the legendary wine and the drinker's extreme nature. For historians, the piece offers insight into popular folklore and storytelling published during the colonial period (1941). The use of Hanja alongside Hangul, older grammatical forms, and the theme of a traditional legend provide linguistic and cultural data points from that era, reflecting what was permissible or popular content in mainstream magazines under Japanese rule.

傳說 千日酒의 由來
						太白山人
狄希는 中山縣 사람으로 千日酒를 만들었습니다. 이 술을 한번 마시면 千日을 취한다는 이상한 古今 獨特의 술입니다. 당시 有州에 사는 玄名石은 술을 대단히 좋아하여 문자 그대로 一日斗酒를 사양치 않는다는 酒豪이였습니다. 여러 가지 술을 먹었지만 어느것이나 먹고 나서는 마즈막에는 에더 좋은 술은 없나하고 구할 때 이 千日酒 이야기를 듣고 쏜살같이 狄希의 집으로 달려가 千日酒를 구하였습니다. 狄希 말에는 「나의 술은 아직 충분히 먹기까지는 아직 안되였소.」
본래 술귀신인 玄名石인지라. 안됐으니까 더욱 먹구 싶어서 「어떤 것이던지 좋소. 한잔 만이면 좋소. 한잔주요」하고 애걸하였습니다. 狄希는 再二 거절하였지만 玄名石은 듣지 않고
「어떻게 되였든 상관없소」하고 말하여 狄希는 할 수 없이 「한잔만」이란 조건으로 주었습니다. 玄名石은 용기있게 집으로 돌아와 급히 한잔 마시자 고대로 빳빳서서 죽어버렸습니다. 집의 사람들은 아무 것도 모르고 울면서 형체 그대로 장사지냈습니다. 그 후 3년이 지냈습니다. 狄希는 玄名石에게 준 술이 생각나서 그의 집을 찾어 갔습니다. 그 집사람에게 玄名石의 안부를 무르니 그 집사람은 이상한 얼굴을 하고 「벌써 玄名石은 죽었습니다. 벌써 3년이나 되였습니다.」
狄希 깜작 놀랬습니다.
「그것도 술때문이요. 千日 자는 술을 먹었으므로 죽지 않었을 것입니다. 오늘이 바로 그 술이 깨는 날입니다.」
狄希는 그 집사람들과 함께 玄名石을 장사한 무덤을 가보니 무덤 우에는 땀을 흘리는 것처럼 水氣가 눅눅했습니다. 그 무덤을 파고 관을 열고 보니 그 때가 바로 玄名石의 술깨는 때였습니다. 玄名石은 눈을 뜨고 입을 열어 큰소리로 부르지젔습니다.
「아 참 기분 좋다. 정말 기분 조쿤. 참 좋은 술이군. 그런데 대체 내가 얼마나 잣는지 몰으겠네.」
이 소리를 들은 무덤 우에 사람들은 모다 웃었습니다. 玄名石을 관에서 끄내 보니 몹에서는 아직 술내가 코를 찌르게 지독히 났다. 玄名石이가 본래 몸으로 되기까지는 석달이 걸녔다한다.<105>
