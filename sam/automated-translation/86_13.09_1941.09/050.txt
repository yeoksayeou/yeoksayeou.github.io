七月常會 (July Regular Meeting)
						椎木美代子 (Shiiki Miyoko)

The July Regular Meeting, a commemorative month, amidst the morning breeze that dawned with rainbow-colored clouds.

The overnight rain cleared this morning; those gathered for the regular meeting speak cheerfully.

The Governor-General's address is strong; it comes ringing clearly from the microphone. The heroic cry of the Way of the Subject.

Listening to the address from the microphone, I wondered if there was anyone who did not feel empathy.<34>

母の歌 (Mother's Song)

My child has grown so much I cannot touch them; accepting their age, there is also loneliness.

Touching the resilience of my child's skin, I vividly imagine, though perhaps I won't cry, the clarity of the next generation.

Because I saw their skin like white jade, my child is the flower of womanly happiness.

無題 (Untitled)

That I am not accepted is due to my own foolishness; I realize there are many wise people.

Sleepless at night, the early morning excitement I know as cowardice, yet I do not think I have fallen.

On the street where a tragedy occurred before the building, it makes one count the backs of aimless passersby.
(The author currently resides in Keijō, Meiji-chō)<35>

**Summary**

This article presents a series of Japanese poems by Shiiki Miyoko, a Japanese resident of colonial Seoul (Keijō). The poems contrast public life under Japanese rule with private, maternal, and introspective feelings. The first section depicts a "July Regular Meeting" permeated by the militaristic rhetoric of the Governor-General's address promoting the "Way of the Subject." Subsequent sections, "Mother's Song" and "Untitled," shift to personal themes: the bittersweet experience of a child growing up, feelings of inadequacy, inner conflict, and observations of urban alienation. From a historical perspective, the poems are interesting for their juxtaposition of mandated public sentiment (loyalty to the Japanese empire) and the personal, sometimes melancholic, inner world of an individual living within that colonial structure during wartime. The explicit mention of the Governor-General's address and the "Way of the Subject" (臣道) provides direct evidence of the political atmosphere being promoted.

記念月七月常會は七彩の雲に明けたる朝風の中にて

夜來の雨この朝霽れて常會に集へる人等ほがらに申す

子の肌の彈みに手觸れ泣かまくも現(うつつ)にえがく次代の冴えを

白玉に似たる肌(はだへ)とみしからに吾子はをみなのさきはひのはな
