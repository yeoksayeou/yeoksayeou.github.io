Ten Military Aircraft Donated by Korean Compatriots Residing in Fukuoka

Korean compatriots residing in Fukuoka Prefecture (福岡縣), recognizing the pressing current situation, have been dedicating their utmost sincerity as citizens of the home front through慰問 (comfort visits) to front-line soldiers and families of deployed soldiers, labor service, and more. As a commemorative project celebrating 2,600 years since the founding of the Empire last year, funds for donating weaponry were being collected from Koreans residing in Japan who are joint members of the Central Kyōwakai (中央協和會) and the Kumamoto Prefecture (熊本縣) Kyōwakai. The fruits of that sincerity were recently realized, gathering a large sum totaling 520,000 Won from across the country. Of this, 500,000 Won was used to donate five military aircraft (軍用機) each to the Army and Navy authorities, and a portion of the remaining funds was donated as relief money for soldiers (恤兵金) to the Kumamoto ○○ Hospital on the 18th.

Apostles of Korea-Manchuria as One – Autumn Brilliance Shining on the Continent; Manchuria Moved by Korean Youth Corps Service

The Manchurian Construction Labor Service Korean Youth Corps (滿洲建設勤勞奉仕朝鮮青年隊), which departed to offer the precious sweat of their service for the construction of Manchuria, left for Yanji (延吉) and Dongshengyong (東盛湧) in Manchukuo (滿洲國) with about 260 members at the end of last month. Possessing the fervent special will, "We will offer even these bodies for the construction of Manchuria!", they are performing their sacred work without a single person falling ill, according to a report received from Manchukuo on the 22nd. Letters of gratitude for their hard work have arrived at the Government-General (總督府), reportedly evoking admiration from all quarters by revealing the beautiful spirit of Korea-Manchuria as One (鮮滿一如).
Specifically, they are divided into the Yanji group and the Dongshengyong group. In each group, all members rise at 5:30 AM to the wake-up call bugle, perform the morning obeisance (배례), and do joint combined gymnastics. Then, from 7:30 AM to 12:00 PM, and again from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, they endure the continental heat all day long, carrying out vigorous labor service. The passion for Manchurian construction reportedly shines on their copper-tanned skin.

Sincerity of Three Million Provincial Citizens – Kyŏnggi Province Donates 50,000 Comfort Bags

11,700 comfort bags (慰問袋) filled generously with the home-front sincerity of the three million members of Kyŏnggi Province's Patriotic Squads (愛國班) were gathered at the Provincial Office (道廳) by the 22nd. Consequently, on the 23rd, Provincial Office staff began packing them into wooden boxes for donation to the Chōsen Army Patriotism Department (朝鮮軍愛國部). The comfort bags contain items like snacks and cigarettes, and also include handkerchiefs personally made with great care by female Patriotic Squad members, deeply moving the clerks (게원) handling the items. This is the second batch collected from various districts (部郡); 17,400 bags were donated last March, and another 15,900 are scheduled for donation again in November. Therefore, the number of comfort bags sent to the front line through the home-front sincerity of Kyŏnggi provincial citizens this year alone will reach 50,000.

Mr. Pyŏngnum Yŏnbyŏng (平沼燕炳氏) of 64 Asahi-chō (旭町), Nonsan-ŭp (論山邑), Nonsan County (論山郡), regretful that he could not offer the sincerity of service through his occupation (職域奉公) as a home front citizen due to a deep-seated chronic illness (身病) that kept him constantly confined to his sickbed, visited the local police station (當地警察署) and donated 1,000 Won in cash for national defense. He left, saying he would be grateful if this could atone for even a ten-thousandth part of the 'sin' of not being able to fulfill his national duty (國民義務). <127>

복강현(福岡縣) 재주 조선동포들은 기피 시국을 인식 제일선장병급 출정군인 유가족에 대한 위문과 근로봉사등, 총후국민답게 열성을 다하여왔는데 작년기원 二천六백년 봉충긔념사업으로서 중앙협화회와 웅본현(熊本縣)협화회와의 공동회원인 내지재주소선인으로부터 병기헌납자금을 모집중이든바 그적성의 결실을 매저 전국에서 총액 五十二만원의 다액을 거두었다. 그중 五十만원으로는 륙해군당국에 각 五기식 군용기(軍用機)를 헌납하고 남는자금의 一부는 十八일웅본(熊本)○○病院에 휼병금(恤兵金)으로 헌납하였다.

百萬圓突破도 不遠 事變後海軍武官府에의 獻金集計

사변이래 총후국민의 적성을 반영한 헌금열은 그칠줄을 모르고 더욱 높아가고 있는데 六월중의 해군무관부(海軍武官府)를 거처서 헌납된것만 보아도 헌금이 一백七十六건에 그금액이 一만二백九十五원이고 恤兵金이 八十三건에 그금액이 七천三백九十五원 도합 一만七천원이나되며 그 외에 위문대가 三천八백四十개 연초가 八천개 위문편지가 四천여통이다. 그리고 사변당초부터 무관부에서취급한 헌금과 휼병금의 연별통게는 다음과가치 건수가 가속도직으로 늘어나고있서 총후국민의 열성을 열심히 하고있다. 즉 소화十二년에는 건수 三十건에 금액은 四十四만九천三十七원 소화三十년에는 건수 六十九건에 금액은 十三만八천四백九十九원 十四년에는 건수八十건에 금액은 四만二천六백五十八원 十五년에는 건수 一백五十五건에 금액은 二十만四천三백九十六원 十六년에는 六월三十일 현재로 건수 一천二十一건에 금액은 十四만二천二백二十二원이다.＜126＞

만주건설에 귀한땀의 봉사를 하려떠난 만주건설근로봉사조선청년대(滿洲洲建設勤勞奉仕朝鮮靑年)는 지난 월말 만주국연길(延吉)과동성룡(東盛湧)으로 二백六十여명이 출발한후 이들은『만주건설을 위하여 이몸이라도 밧치이라!』는 열렬한 특지를 가지고 한사람의 고장도없이 거룩한 작업을하고있다는것을 지나 二十二日 만주국으로부터 보고가 왔으며 이들의 수고에 감사한다는 인사의 편지가 총독부로 와서 선만一여(鮮滿一如)의 아름다운 정신을 드러내고있다고해서 각방면의감격을 자어내고있다한다
즉 이들은 연길반과 동성룡반의 두반으로 난호여각반에서는 아츰 다섯시반에 기상나팔에 전원이 이러나 아츰의 배례를하고 합동연합체조 그리고 일곱시반부터 열두시까지 또한시부터 여섯시까지 하로종일 대륙의 더위를 익여가며 씩씩한 근로봉사를 하여 적동가치 검어케 탄 그들의 살결에는 만주건성의 정렬이 빛나고 있다는 것이다.
