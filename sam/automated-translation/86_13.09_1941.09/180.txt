Editor's Postscript

We believe the round-table discussion on "Naesŏn Cultural Exchange" (內鮮文化交流), centered around Keijō Imperial University President Shinoda (■田氏), was a very meaningful gathering under the current wartime situation. Furthermore, we consider the article discussing the various issues of Korean housing, born from a meeting where executives from the Housing Corporation (住宅營團) and the All-Out Effort Korea League (總力朝鮮聯盟幹部諸氏) gathered together, to be a good harvest.
□
Starting from this month's issue, we have established a special academic lecture series on our pages. As the first installment, mobilizing the faculty of Ewha Women's College (梨花女專敎授陣), we have featured special sections on Philosophy (哲學), Literature (文學), Music (音樂), Linguistics (言語學), Home Economics (家庭學), and Physical Education (體育學), which we take pride in for this month's issue. Moving forward, we intend to continue by mobilizing the faculties of Keijō Imperial University (京城帝大), Posŭng College (普性專門), Yŏnhŭi College (延禧專門), Sookmyung Women's College (淑明女專), and Hyehwa College (惠化專門) to publish articles on various academic fields such as Law (法學), Economics (經濟), Philosophy (哲學), Religion (宗敎), and Literature (文學).
□
Furthermore, we have begun serializing the full scenario (씨나리오 全文) of the volunteer soldier film (志願兵映畵) "You and I" (그대와 나), currently being produced by the Chōsen Army Command (朝鮮軍司令部) and undergoing location shooting (로케-中). Additionally, we believe the round-table discussion held centered around Mr. Hinatsu Eitarō (日夏英太郞) (formerly Hŏ Yŏng (許泳)), the director of the film "You and I," will also be a good read in the entertainment section (演藝欄).
□
In this month's Literature and Arts (文藝) section, we have specially featured recent works of "Korean Ballads" (朝鮮歌謠). We also think the novels by various authors, starting with "Mountain Flowers" (山花) by the rising writer Sŏk Inhae (石仁海氏), are a fine gift we send to our readers for their summer reading (銷夏).

★Samch'ŏlli Branch Recruitment

We are widely establishing branches (支社) in various places in Seoul and the countryside (京鄕各處). Interested parties, please request the internal regulations (內規), and we will send them. We hope many branches will be established.

To Our Readers (讀者諸氏에게)

As this is a time of extreme paper conservation (用紙를 極度로 節約하는때), we cannot print more than a fixed number of copies (一定한 部數) beforehand. If you order after the month's issue (冊) has come out, there is often concern (念慮) it will be sold out (品切). Therefore, please send payment (代金) for half a year (半年分) or a full year (一年分) in advance and become an annual subscriber (年定讀者).＜204＞

**Summary**

This editor's postscript from the September 1941 issue of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine highlights key articles, including discussions on Japan-Korea cultural exchange and housing issues involving wartime organizations. It announces a new academic lecture series featuring prominent colonial-era colleges and the serialization of the screenplay for a Japanese military propaganda film, "You and I," promoting the volunteer soldier system. The literary section features Korean ballads and new fiction. The postscript also includes calls for branch managers and encourages readers to subscribe annually due to wartime paper shortages. From a historical perspective, the postscript vividly illustrates the magazine operating under late colonial, wartime conditions. It showcases the promotion of state-sponsored concepts like "Naesŏn" (Japan-Korea unity) and the volunteer soldier system, alongside cultural content, reflecting the complex reality of cultural production under Japanese rule and mobilization efforts. The recruitment notice and subscription plea highlight the economic pressures and distribution strategies of the time.
