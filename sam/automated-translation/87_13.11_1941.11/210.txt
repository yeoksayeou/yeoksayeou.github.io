Article Title: 實話-極度의 偏食에서 脚氣를 알어 執務中쓰러저 (True Story - Suffering from Beriberi Due to Extreme Picky Eating and Collapsing During Work)
Author: 谷川末男
Article Type: 회고·수기 (Reminiscence/Memoir)

I believe my illness was caused by picky eating (偏食). More than anything, since birth until today, I have never once eaten barley rice (麥飯), and regarding side dishes (副食物), I had so many likes and dislikes (好不好) that I felt inconvenienced myself and truly had difficulties.

A year after graduating from elementary school, I developed night blindness (夜盲症) and received treatment from a doctor. Meanwhile, I also paid attention to my dietary intake (食餌의 攝取), and fortunately, I recovered (轉快). So I started commuting (通勤) to the factory again, but about two months later, this time my whole body became listless, and I felt extremely fatigued (疲勞) from work, making it impossible to work like my colleagues (同僚). However, due to family circumstances, I couldn't take time off (休業), so while overexerting myself (無理), I continued going to work (出勤). Then, in August of Shōwa 15 (1940), I finally became unable to move while on duty and had to be taken home by my colleagues. The doctor's diagnosis was beriberi (脚氣). While taking prescribed medicine (醫藥), I also saw advertisements (廣告) in newspapers and magazines and tried every medicine that I thought might work, but there was no particular effect (效果). While suffering (苦生) like this, my older brother returned home after a long absence. When I told him about my symptoms (病症) in detail, he said, "Then, Wakamoto (와까모도) is good," and bought me a 25-day supply. I started taking (服用) it as instructed, and after about nine days, the constipation (便秘) for which I had been using enemas (浣腸) was relieved (解消), and I started having regular bowel movements (便痛) every day. Encouraged by this, I continued taking it, and on the 90th day since becoming ill, and the XXth day since starting Wakamoto, I finally experienced the joy of slight recovery. Now, the swelling (浮腫) in my feet is gone, my mind and body (心身) feel refreshed (爽快), and I have since returned to engaging in labor (勞働). <119>

**Summary**

The author, Tanigawa Sueo, recounts his struggle with severe beriberi, which he attributes to his lifelong extremely picky eating habits, notably his refusal to eat barley rice. After developing night blindness and later extreme fatigue that led to his collapse at work, conventional medical treatments and advertised remedies failed. His condition finally improved after his brother recommended the Japanese digestive medicine Wakamoto, which resolved his constipation and eventually led to his full recovery and return to work. From a historical perspective, this article published in a prominent Korean magazine (Samch'ŏlli) is interesting as it features a Japanese author discussing his personal health issues and recovery thanks to a Japanese product (Wakamoto). It highlights the presence and influence of Japanese individuals and commercial products within colonial Korean society, touching upon aspects of health, diet (mentioning barley rice, common during shortages), and consumer culture promoted through media advertisements during that period.

實話-極度의 偏食에서 脚氣를 알어 執務中쓰러저
						谷川末男
나의 病은 偏食이 原因이라고생각하고 있습니다. 무엇보다도 出生後今日까지 한번도麥飯을먹지않엇고 副食物에있어는 好不好가많어서 自己로서도 不自由함을느끼고 참으로 困難하였습니다.
小學校를 卒業하고 一年後에, 夜盲症에걸리어서 醫師의 治療를받으며 一方으로 自己도 食餌의 攝取에 注意하였든바, 多幸히 轉快하였음으로 다시 工場에 通勤하고 있었는데 二個月쯤부터 이번은 全身이 느른하여저서 非常히일에 疲勞를느끼게되여 同僚와 같이 일을못하게되였습니다. 그러나 집안 事情도있서 일을 休業할수도없어서 無理를하면서도 出勤하고있는中에 昭和十五年八月 드디어 熱務中에움주거리지못하게되여 同僚가없어서 歸家하게되였습니다. 醫師의 診察로는 脚氣라하여, 醫藥을먹으면서 新聞과 雜誌의 廣告를보고서는 이것이라고생각나는 藥은 모두 服用하여 보았으나 別效果가없었습니다. 그러케 苦生하든中 나의 兄이 오랜간만에 歸家하여서 病症을여러가지로 뭇더니 그러면은『와까모도』가 좋다하여 二十五日分을 사다주었다. 말하는대로 服用을 始作하였더니 約九日쯤되여 只今까지 浣腸하고있는 便秘가 解消되고 每日定하고 便痛가있게되었습니다. 거기에 힘을어더서 더욱 服用을 繼續하고있는 中에 病이잇게된 九十日째『와까모도』服用以來××日만에 겨우 輕快의기쁨을 보게되었습니다. 지금은 발의 浮腫도 없어지고 心身도 爽快히되어서 그 後勞働에 從事하고있습니다.＜119＞
