【Overseas Secret】 How Much Gold Does the US Currently Have? -Occupying Three-Fourths of the Entire World-

In the United States, which has been filling its belly by monopolizing the military procurement boom since the Great European War, gold from all over the world continues to be concentrated. According to a recent announcement by the Treasury Department in Washington, $14,579,501,387 worth of gold is currently stored in the Federal Government-owned large underground vault (with the latest equipment to avoid bombs) in the mountains of Kentucky state at "Fort Knox." This is truly an astonishing amount of gold, representing half of the world's current total gold currency amount of approximately $30 billion. Since last year, due to Britain's large-scale arms purchases and the freezing of assets from various countries under German military occupation, America's gold has only drastically increased. Thus, the Treasury Department, in extreme secrecy since last July, has been intermittently transporting this gold from New York to the large vault in Kentucky state using registered mail, successfully moving a total of $9,000,005,511 worth of gold in eight months. It is said that 45 special trains were used for this transport, and police officers armed with pistols and machine guns, G-men, postal inspectors, and soldiers cooperated to guard it; <66> the weight of the gold was 9,000 tons, and the registered mail fee was $1.8 million.

The total amount of gold currently held by the US government, combining the aforementioned $14.5 billion in the Fort Knox vault with the gold dispersed and stored in large vaults in New York, Philadelphia, Myeba (Denver?), San Francisco, etc., reaches $72.2 billion. Indeed, the United States occupies three-fourths of the total amount of gold in the entire world.<67>

**Summary**

This 1941 article reports on the vast accumulation of gold by the United States, fueled by the ongoing war in Europe. It highlights that the US holds nearly $14.6 billion in gold at Fort Knox, Kentucky, having secretly transferred over $9 billion from New York via heavily guarded special trains. The article claims the total US gold reserves amount to $72.2 billion, representing three-quarters of the world's total gold, attributing this increase to British arms purchases and the freezing of assets from German-occupied nations. For historians of Korean colonial history, this article is interesting as it reflects the global geopolitical and economic situation influencing East Asia, published in a Korean magazine under Japanese rule. It portrays the US as an economic powerhouse profiting from the war, potentially serving implicitly as propaganda contrasting American wealth with the sacrifices demanded by Japan's war effort, or perhaps subtly highlighting the global shifts in power relevant to Korea's future. The potentially exaggerated figure for total US gold reserves ($72.2 billion instead of the historically accepted ~$22 billion) might also reflect wartime information control or sensationalism.

【海外機密】米國의 現有의 金은얼만가?-全世界의 四分之三을 占有-
歐洲大戰以來 軍需景氣를 혼자 獨占하여 배를 채우고있는 現象인 米國에서는 全世界의 金을 續續集中하고 있는데, 最近와싱톤 財務省의 發表에 依하면, 目下 켄탓키-州의 山中「포-드ㆍ녹스」에 있는 聯邦政府所有인 地下大金庫(爆彈을 避하는 最新設備)속에는 百四十五億 七千九百五十萬一千三百八十七弗의 金이 貯藏되였다고 한다. 이것은 現世界의 金貨總額約三百億弗의 절반이 되는 實로 놀라운 金高다. 昨年以來 英國의 武器大量買入과 獨軍占領下의 各國資金凍結에 依하여 米國의 金은 激增할 뿐이다. 그리하여 財務省에서는 昨年七月以來, 極秘中에 뉴욕으로부터 이들 金을 書留郵便을 利用하여 켄탓키-州의 大金庫에 輸送을 斷續하여 八個月만에 總額 九十億五千五백十一弗의 金을 無事히 運搬했다한다 이 運送에 使用한 特別列車가 四十五輛, 모두 피스톨과 機關銃을 가진 警官, G멘, 郵便監視人, 軍兵이 協力하여 護衛했다＜66＞고하며, 金의 重量은 九千돈, 書留郵便料가 百八十萬弗이라한다.
米國政府가 現在有所한 金의 總額은, 前記 포드ㆍ녹스 大金庫에 있는 百四十五億弗外에 뉴욕, 필라델피아, 몌바, 桑港等의 大金庫에 分散貯藏한 金을 合計하면 七百二十二億弗에 達하는데, 實로 全世界의 金의 總額의 四分之三을 米國이 占有하고있다.＜67＞
