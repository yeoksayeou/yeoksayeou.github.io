Number of Air Raid Victims in Great Britain

In response to a parliamentary question, Ms. Ellen Wilkinson, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of the British Ministry of Home Security, announced that the number of air raid victims in Great Britain to date includes 28,859 civilian deaths and 40,166 serious injuries.

Number of Church Buildings Destroyed by Mutual Air Raids between Britain, Germany, and Italy

Up until March 21st of this year, the number of churches destroyed by air raids in Great Britain was 714 completely destroyed or nearly destroyed<64> and 1,945 damaged. In contrast, it is said that only one was destroyed on the German side, the Genoa Cathedral, and even that only had its glass windows broken.

An 80-Year-Old's Lifetime Living Expenses: 26,000 Yen

An 80-year-old man calculated his lifetime living expenses at 26,000 yen. His costs for food, clothing, and shelter were as follows:
Food Costs: 87 sŏk 6 tu of rice (米八七石六斗) 3,810 Yen
Side Dish Costs: 8,760 Yen
Clothing Costs: 645 Yen
Marriage Costs: 1,200 Yen
Social Expenses: 1,050 Yen

[Corrupted Text] Secretary Arrested

It is reported that on the 9th, the Los Angeles prosecuting authorities arrested Hollywood resident Kōno Toraichi ([Corrupted Text] 푸링 Secretary 高野虎市民) on suspicion of collecting national defense-related intelligence for the benefit of a foreign country.

30,000 Killed or Injured by Poison Gas

It is calculated that the amount of poison gas used during the previous World War I exceeded 100,000 tons. Theoretically, this possessed the power to kill 100 billion people, which is twenty times the world's population. However, it is said that the actual number of deaths caused by poison gas was merely 30,000.
Total Killed and Injured: 35,000,000
Deaths among them: 10,500,000
Killed and Injured by Gas: 500,000

Argument Against Blackouts in Great Britain

Voices have arisen in Great Britain claiming that blackouts during air raids are useless. Why? Because night bombers approaching their target, if there are no clouds, can drop illumination flares, making everything perfectly clear. Also, exploding bombs can serve as illumination flares. Even if lights are turned off, the boundary between water and land is clearly visible at a glance. Therefore, wouldn't it be more effective to radiate the total electricity used by the city into the air, or gather other lights to create a fake city, making it difficult for aircraft to distinguish? However, it is said they still don't know which method is better.<65>

**Summary**

This article compiles several brief news items from overseas in late 1941. It reports on British civilian casualties from air raids, compares church destruction in Britain and Germany, details the estimated lifetime expenses of an elderly man, notes the arrest of a Japanese individual in Los Angeles for espionage, reflects on the surprisingly low death toll from poison gas in WWI compared to its potential, and discusses debates in Britain about the effectiveness of wartime blackouts. From a colonial Korean history perspective, the article is interesting as it shows the kind of international news curated for a Korean audience under Japanese rule, focusing heavily on the European war theatre (UK/Germany) and including an item about Japanese espionage in the US, hinting at rising tensions shortly before Pearl Harbor. The cost of living calculation also provides a potential data point for economic historians studying the period.

英國에 燈火管制反對論

空襲時의 燈火管制는 쓸데없다는 소리가 英國에서 일어났다. 웨그러냐하면 目的物에 接近한 夜間爆擊機는 구름만 없으면 照明彈을 投下하면, 一目瞭然하기 때문이다. 또 炸裂하는 爆彈은 照明彈代身도된다. 불은 꺼도 水面과 陸地의 境界는 一見하여 明瞭하기 때문이다 그리고 市街에 쓰는 總電力을 空中에 放射한다든지 또는 다른 光線을 모아 가짜 市街를 만든다든지하여 飛行機에서 보아 잘 分間할수 없게하는편이 더 效果的이 되지 않을까 한다고한다. 그러나 아직 어느편이 나흘지 모르겠다고한다.＜65＞
