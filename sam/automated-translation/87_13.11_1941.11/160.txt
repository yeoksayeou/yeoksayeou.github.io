**Donations of "Patriotic Planes" Out of Sincere Patriotism Expected to Break 100 This Year**

Mr. Kitano Taizō (北野退藏), the Director (理事長) of the Chōsen Sardine Oil Manufacturing Fisheries Cooperative Federation (朝鮮■油製造水産組合聯合會) located at Namdaemun-t'ong (南大門通) 2-chōme, Pusan, visited Army Commander Sakagaki (坂垣) at the Chōsen Army Command at 2 PM on the 11th of last month and donated 275,000 wŏn, deeply moving the officials concerned.
The army decided to use this money to purchase five fighter planes and allocate 10,000 wŏn for Chōsen's air defense equipment costs. The number of patriotic planes from within Chōsen, realized through the sincerity of the home front (總後), reaches a total of 72 when adding these five and the Kyŏngnam Farmer's Plane (慶南農民號), and furthermore, including those currently being processed, it truly reaches about 80, meaning the breakthrough of 100 patriotic planes is said to be not far off. Thus, the army aims to break through 100 patriotic planes within this year and hopes for the powerful cooperation of the peninsula's populace. <82>

**Korean White-Robed Angel**

Miss Matsuda Shōgyoku (松田正玉) (Ch'oe Chŏngok 崔正玉) (20 years old), the first person of Korean origin to become an Army Nurse (陸軍看護婦), has already been at the Kokura Army Hospital (小倉陸軍病院) for half a year, raising the expectations (輿望) of the peninsula's women. Subsequently, she showed good results, leading Hospital Director Kishimoto (岸本) to exclaim, "Truly excellent results!"
Thus, even the white-robed warriors (白衣の勇士) came to seek out Miss Matsuda. Aiming for the official Japanese Red Cross Army Nurse examination to be held in November, she is absorbed in studying while working. The reflections she wrote and submitted to Hospital Director Kishimoto on the 12th are as follows:
"(Previous part omitted) Although there are some difficulties, when I think that they are soldiers wounded for the country, I encourage myself by thinking that such things are nothing, and I deeply feel that I must provide nursing care just as kindly as other nurses, trying to comfort them as much as possible. Also, I am studying nursing science fundamentally as a nursing skill and cultivating myself, striving daily to work for the country even just a little."

**Ch'oe Sŭnghŭi's Consolation Dance Performance**

To represent the women of the peninsula and offer comforting greetings to the white-robed warriors at the Kokura Army Hospital where Miss Ch'oe Chŏngok is serving, the peninsula-born dancer Miss Ch'oe Sŭnghŭi (崔承喜) stopped by the Kokura Army Hospital during her Kyūshū tour on the 22nd of last month and passionately performed a dance of gratitude as a moving consolation greeting. <83>

**Summary**

This article from November 1941 reports on displays of Korean loyalty to the Japanese Empire during wartime. It highlights a significant donation by the head of a Korean fisheries federation for five fighter planes ("patriotic planes"), contributing to a total nearing 100 such planes donated from Korea. It also features Ch'oe Chŏngok, lauded as the first Korean army nurse, serving diligently at a Japanese military hospital in Kokura, and the famous Korean dancer Ch'oe Sŭnghŭi performing for wounded Japanese soldiers there. From a historical perspective, the article is a clear piece of wartime propaganda showcasing Korean participation in the Japanese war effort, emphasizing financial contributions and service to frame Koreans as loyal subjects of the Empire. The specific naming of donors, the highlighting of the "first Korean army nurse," and the involvement of a cultural figure like Ch'oe Sŭnghŭi would be of interest to historians studying colonial mobilization, propaganda techniques, and the complex responses of Koreans under Japanese rule.

赤誠의 愛國機獻納 今年內로 一百機突破豫想

부대남대문통(南大門通) 二정목 조선정어리유비제조수산조합연합회(朝鮮■油製造水産組合聯合會) 리사장(理事長)북야퇴장(北野退藏)씨는 지난 十一일 오후두시 조선군사령부로 판원(坂垣)군사령관을 방문하고 二十七만 五千원을 헌납하여 관게자를 감격시켰다.
군에서는 이돈으로 전투기 다섯 대와 조선방공기재비로 一만원을 드려노키로 되었다. 총후정성으로 이루어지는 조선내의 애국기는 이번의 五기와 경남농민호(慶南農民號)를 합처서 도합 七十二기에 달하며 다시 신입중인것까지 합치면 실로 八十여기에 달하여 애국기 一백기의돌파도 머지안타고한다. 이라하여 군에서는 금년내에 애국기 一백기의 돌파를 목표로하여 반도민중의 힘있는 협력을 바라고있다.＜82＞

朝鮮人白衣天使

朝鮮人 出身으로 처음 陸軍看護婦가 된 松田正玉(崔正玉)孃 (二十歲)은 小倉陸軍病院에 들어간지 벌써 半年이 되어 半島女性의 輿望을 일으켰는대 그 後 좋은 成績을 나타내여 岸本病院長드「창으로 훌륭한 成績이요」하고 感嘆하고 있었다.
그리하여 白衣의 勇士들도 松田氏만 찾게 되었다. 十一月에 施行하는 正式 日本赤十字陸軍看護婦의 試驗을 目標로 일하면서 工夫하기에 餘念이 없는 그가 十二日 岸本病院長앞에 써올린 感想手記는 다음과 같다.
『(前畧)多少 괴로운점이 있으나 나라를 위하여 負傷된 兵士라는것을 생각할때에는 그것쯤은 아무것도 아니라고 내 자신을 격려하여 다른 看護婦보다 못하지않게 친절히 看護해주지 않이서는 않되겠다고 깊이생각하고 될수있는대로 위로하고 있다. 그리고 看護婦技術로써의 看護婦學을 根本的으로 工夫하고 修養하여 조곰이라도 나라를 위해 일해보고저 每日 마음을 쓰고 있다.』
