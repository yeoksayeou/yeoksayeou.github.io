笑話 (Jokes/Funny Stories)

碑文 (Epitaph)
A certain man erected a tombstone on his wife's grave, and the inscription read:
"Of all the virtues you showed me, the best virtue was dying before me."

지긋지긋한 결혼 (Sick and Tired of Marriage)
Wife on her deathbed: "When I die, please quickly marry a gentle young lady."
Husband: "Why do you say such things? I will absolutely not remarry."
Wife, delighted: "Oh, really? You'll stay single?"
Husband: "Of course, once was enough. Who would get married again?"

復雜한 關係 (Complicated Relationship)
Mrs. A: "Who was that lady greeting Ms. Chŏngae just now?"
Mrs. B: "She's the lover of the current husband of my very first husband's first wife."<40>

兩班 (Yangban)
Moralist Scholar: "Alas! In these degenerate times, the *Yangban* are disappearing!"
Youth: "It's not that the *Yangban* are disappearing, it's that all the commoners (*sangnom*) have become *Yangban*."

공것 (Free Stuff)
Salvation Army Officer: "We don't take even a penny. Please come in and listen to the preaching."
Passerby: "Hey, Mister! In a world where even paid preaching isn't refreshing, what good could free stuff be?"<35> <40, 35>

**Summary**

This article presents a collection of five short, cynical jokes from 1930. The jokes cover themes such as unhappy marriages and death, complex social relationships, the perceived decline or transformation of the traditional *Yangban* social class, and skepticism towards public religious appeals, specifically from the Salvation Army. For historians, these jokes offer glimpses into social commentary and attitudes of the period, reflecting contemporary views on marriage, class dynamics during a time of social change, and perhaps a certain weariness or cynicism towards public institutions or appeals in colonial Korea. The humor itself, often dark or ironic, is also indicative of the era's popular culture.
