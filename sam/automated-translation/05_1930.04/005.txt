**Body Text Translation:**
Origin of Pen Names (2)

"Sangsŏp" (想涉)
Yŏm Sangsŏp (廉想涉)

My pen name (雅號) was created when I was 22 or 23 years old during my time studying abroad in Tokyo (東京). I took the sound of my name and matched it with other characters (文字) that appealed to me. It also has the profound meaning of contemplation (思素), so I made it "Sangsŏp" (想涉). Later, I saw that O Sangsun (吳想殉) and Yi Sanghwa (李相和) and many others also created names by taking the sound of their given names.

"Paekhwa" (白華)
Yang Kŏnsik (梁健植)

Both now and in the past, I believe in Buddhism (佛敎). In Buddhist scriptures (佛經), 'hwa' (華) refers to the lotus flower (蓮). Therefore, Paekhwa means "White Lotus" (白蓮). Initially, when translating and publishing a Chinese novel in the Maeil Sinbo (每日申報), I used "Kugyŏ" (菊如), but as I gradually used it, it didn't feel right, so about ten years ago, I changed it to "Paekhwa." <11>

**Summary**

This article features two prominent Korean intellectuals, Yŏm Sangsŏp and Yang Kŏnsik, explaining how they chose their pen names (雅號, aho). Yŏm Sangsŏp derived "Sangsŏp" from the sound of his given name while studying in Tokyo, imbuing it with the meaning of contemplation. Yang Kŏnsik, a Buddhist, chose "Paekhwa" based on the term for lotus flower in scriptures, meaning "White Lotus," after previously using another name while working for the Maeil Sinbo newspaper. For historians, the article offers insights into the personal reflections and cultural influences (like studying abroad, Buddhism) shaping the identities of Korean writers during the colonial period, as well as their engagement with contemporary media outlets like the Maeil Sinbo.

雅號의 由來(2)

「想涉」
廉想涉

나의 雅號는 二十二三歲의 東京遊學時代에 지은것인데 일홈의 音을 다가 마음에맛는 다른 文字로 맞추어 노흔것이라 思素한다는 그윽한 도 잇서 「想涉」이라 한 것이다. 그뒤에보니 吳想殉이고 李相和氏 고제일홈의 音을 取하여짓는분이 만허지드구만

「白華」
梁健植

나는 예나 지금이나 佛敎를 밋는데 佛經에 華라함은 蓮을 가르친 것이라 그러기에 白華는 「白蓮」이란 이 된다 처음 每日申報에 中國小說을 譯載할는 「菊如」라하엿는데 차츰 써가다가 마음에 맛지안어서 「白華」로 고친지 約十年＜11＞
