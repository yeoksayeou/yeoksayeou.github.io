Author: 崔麟
Article Type: 대담·좌담 (Interview/Discussion)

○Reporter: Sir, six or seven years ago, when the movement to establish a People's University first arose on this land, you were very active as one of the initiators. Now that the movement has stalled, you too have become quiet, which is regrettable. To develop and protect our unique culture and also to carry out great construction projects for the future, having at least one institution of higher learning like a People's University seems absolutely necessary. I believe a major movement of ours must rise again to revive this. Sir, what are your thoughts on reviving the university?

○Ch'oe: Of course, it's a necessary task. What comes to mind now is when I was traveling through various foreign countries years ago; wherever I went, the compatriots residing there would grab hold of me and most urgently and passionately ask about and discuss two things: the outcome of the People's University movement and the subsequent progress of the movement to promote domestic products. Although I wasn't particularly spurred by this, I had originally always been thinking about this issue. So, even when I went to America, I thought, if the university movement had just continued in Chosŏn at that time, wouldn't I have sought assistance from philanthropists inside and outside America? Would culture have borders set? It seemed possible to raise several hundred thousand won there, money that couldn't be gathered entirely by our own hands, and indeed, there were several opportunities to do so. However, since the movement in the homeland had already been suspended, I simply gave up and returned.

○Reporter: That is regrettable. By the way, the significant reasons for the failure during the first movement back then are attributed to the consecutive floods and droughts that struck all of Chosŏn for two years, internal discord among the leadership, and certain external interference. What are your thoughts, Sir?

○Ch'oe: Actually, at that time, I was merely an initiator and didn't intervene much directly. Regarding fundraising, I only went once to the Hwanghae Province area at the request of a certain Mr. Kim, so I wasn't particularly busy running around and don't know the details well. However, besides the reasons mentioned above, I feel that perhaps public opinion was somewhat lacking, and perhaps the method of the movement was a bit too broad (汎潃). Creating a university is truly a great undertaking that requires the power of the masses. <5> Therefore, one must first present this issue widely to the world, and even if there is an opposing faction, only after securing the support of the vast majority can one finally begin. There are two types of movements: the so-called backroom movement (暗室運動), where a few influential figures gather in secret to plot, and the movement that proceeds openly before the masses, gaining their guidance, supervision, and cooperation. In other countries, the methods of political party movements may require secrecy, allowing the will of a few to regulate the whole, and even attempt to impose decisions on the majority. But for something like building a university, can it be done merely through the discussions of a few people? I believe one must first present the issue widely to the world, observe the trends, and then embark on the task.

○Reporter: And what do you mean by the movement's method being too broad?

○Ch'oe: At that time, the total funding goal was ten million won. This was too large an amount considering our reality. Also, the plan needed to be more concrete; in other words, it should have had a framework that was definitely feasible.

○Reporter: Mr. An Chae-hong stated that establishing a single-faculty agricultural college would be possible with a minimum of one hundred fifty thousand won. This seems to be proposing the minimum possible plan considering our impoverished finances. What is your opinion, Sir?

○Ch'oe: No matter if it's an agricultural university, it probably would be difficult with just that. Looking at the situation of a single professional school like the current Posŏng College (普成專門學校) or Buddhist College (佛敎專門學校), I think it would be impossible with that budget. For an agricultural university, a considerable amount of land for farming practice would be necessary, and significant expenses beyond the school buildings for facilities would also be required... Moreover, with a university costing only around a hundred thousand won, there's a risk that public response and interest might not be sufficiently drawn. Therefore, to have a dignified university that can build national authority, about two million won would be needed.

○Reporter: Does that include both the establishment costs and perpetual maintenance funds?

○Ch'oe: Everything. If you just establish the school and plan to collect maintenance fees every year, that would be impossible. Even looking at the various secondary schools that cost forty or fifty thousand won annually, without basic assets, it's absolutely unworkable.

○Reporter: More funds are always better, but would there be a source for such a large amount of money?

○Ch'oe: If there is a will, there is a way. Isn't the Buddhist College, currently managed by the Buddhist side, increasing its capital fund of seven hundred thousand won by adding another three hundred thousand won recently, making it one million won? By the way, according to my investigation of Buddhist funds, there's about twenty million won. Out of twenty million won, contributing one million <6> like that...

◇England's Oxford University◇

○Reporter: But unless they receive some major impulse, would they agree to divert such funds to this kind of field?

○Ch'oe: People who manage money do not hesitate to spend it if that money will live on fruitfully without dying in the future. What comes to mind now is an incident from when I was headmaster of Posŏng High Common School (普成高普) for ten years. During the three years I was imprisoned, the school came under the management of Ch'ŏndogyo, but due to conflict between the old and new factions, it unfortunately met a sad fate. At that time, having thought things over, I left Seoul together with the current headmaster, Mr. Chŏng Tae-hyŏn. I stayed at a Japanese inn in Tongnae Hot Springs, and asked Mr. Chŏng to bring certain high-ranking monks from Yangsan and T'ongdo Temple (通度寺) to Tongnae Hot Springs, avoiding public attention, so we could meet. Eventually, after several days, I met them all at the inn where I was staying. At that time, I told the Buddhist representatives, "The work of Buddhism is not in the mountains. Can Śākyamuni's salvation of all sentient beings (濟度衆生) come from mountain chanting? <7> And even if you sit out on the street like at Kakhwang Temple (覺皇寺) in Seoul, striking a wooden gong and telling everyone to practice asceticism, it won't be effective. There is a separate bridge to reach the masses. Now, take over the management of Posŏng School." I truly spent about fifteen minutes persuading them together. The next day, I returned to Seoul. It seems the monks had made up their minds significantly right there. They immediately avoided public attention and held a large assembly of abbots of major temples in Taejŏn, South Ch'ungch'ŏng Province, soon deciding to manage the school, leading to today's prosperity. Later, they also established and managed the professional school. In essence, if it's money that will live on into the future, since there are still many people on this land who act for righteousness, I believe there will surely be those willing to donate tens of thousands of won. Furthermore, if contributions are accepted not just as cash but as land donations, the possibility increases. Land is also money, after all.

○Reporter: Essentially, the stance of organizations holding large sums, like Ch'ŏndogyo or Buddhism, will critically determine the fate of this revival movement. But what if there's also a segment of people who oppose this university movement?

○Ch'oe: If there's opposition, even during the first movement, some from the socialist side raised objections, reasoning that even if a university were established, it would become nothing more than an educational institution for the propertied class. But thinking about it, it won't necessarily turn out that way. Look at Russia, which is moving towards being a socialist state; how hard are they trying to establish many universities to cultivate the human resources who will inherit Russia's future? Indeed, when I met prominent scholars and politicians abroad years ago, they urged me above all else to cultivate human talent. Also, once the university is established, initially, several world-renowned scholars should be invited, and graduates should be sent to study abroad to broadly raise the level to a global standard.

○Reporter: How can the revival movement be materialized?

○Ch'oe: First, there need to be several individuals who contribute funds in the tens of thousands of won, numerous volunteers who are prepared to suffer harm rather than gain personal benefit from this movement, and also, public opinion needs to reach a boiling point. I am still speaking within the realm of theory, but...

○Reporter: And to what extent would you be willing to exert effort for this movement, Sir?

○Ch'oe: If it becomes necessary for me to step forward, and this is no boast, I have the potential and sincerity to raise about forty or fifty thousand won, even if it means traveling around the thirteen provinces begging (though the exact result is uncertain).

○Reporter: Lastly, how many years do you estimate it would take to raise the two million won needed for its founding?

○Ch'oe: At the shortest, three years, at most, five years. If we start, I believe we must aim to complete it within that period. <8>

**Summary**

Ch'oe Rin argues for the revival of the movement to establish a comprehensive Korean People's University, emphasizing its necessity for cultural development and future construction. He reflects on the previous attempt's failure (blaming disasters, internal strife, external interference, weak public support, and overly ambitious funding goals – 10 million won). He proposes a more realistic 2 million won budget for a comprehensive university, rejecting a smaller agricultural college idea as insufficient. Ch'oe suggests funding could come from large organizations like Buddhist groups (citing his success in persuading them to manage Posŏng School) or through land donations. He counters potential socialist objections by pointing to university development in Soviet Russia. He believes the project could be completed in 3-5 years with dedicated fundraising and strong public backing.

From a historical perspective, this interview is revealing about the aspirations and challenges of Korean nationalist movements under Japanese rule. It highlights the internal debates on strategy (realistic funding vs. ambitious goals, comprehensive vs. specialized institutions), the reliance on existing Korean organizations (like religious groups) for resources, the awareness of international examples (Russia, US philanthropy), and the perceived need for Korean-led higher education distinct from the colonial system (like Keijō Imperial University). Ch'oe Rin's perspective, as a prominent figure (later associated with collaboration), offers insight into the thinking of segments of the Korean elite regarding cultural nationalism and institution-building during this period.
