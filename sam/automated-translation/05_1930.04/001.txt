Prospects and Assertions

○ The Beacon Fire for the Revival of a People's University
Looking at examples of newly rising nations and peoples, they invariably possess "universities" and "university students" that pioneer the new culture of their society and lay the first cornerstone for construction projects. We see this was the case for China, which had Sun Yat-sen University (中山大學) and the Whampoa Military Academy (黃浦軍官學校), for Japan during its construction period, which had Waseda (旱稻田) and Keio (愛應) universities, and likewise for Britain, America, Russia, Ireland (愛國), and others. This is especially true in the context of national movements... though we are late, we too must have a supreme institution of learning for the creation, development, and protection of our unique culture.

Frankly speaking, rather than having three newspaper companies as we do now, we would consider it more a matter of pride (矜持) to have one or two newspaper companies and one "university," and we know it is more beneficial overall to have fewer middle schools and one more university than dozens of middle schools. From this perspective, it would be acceptable to reduce the newspaper business, which consumes over one hundred thousand won annually, by two and remold (改鑄) them into a university; all surplus (剩餘) should be directed where it is needed. Indeed, if reviving the university faces difficulties due to funding issues, who would call it rash talk (暴言) to demand the transformation (變形) of existing institutions (己成機關) like newspaper companies, banks, companies, and secondary schools into a "university"? We firmly believe it. Even if there are places where a university becomes a barometer (로메-터) of decline (顚落), for us, it will be an institution and cornerstone of revival! Therefore (於是乎), as this issue is being proposed as an issue, we hope for broad and careful public discussion going forward.

○ The Necessity of Birth Control (產兒制限)
Where does our poverty come from? Where does this severe pressure of food, clothing, and shelter generally come from? Delving into this requires reaching deep places, but thinking simply, the cause stemming from the imbalance between the population and food resources comes to be regarded as important. Then, can we devise measures (割策) for increasing food supplies? Under the current conditions, that is impossible. Thus, although it is a side aspect (側面) and negative (消極的), we cannot but limit population growth. To do so, Malthus (말사스) already stated that one must either operate through war, epidemic, and great famine, or prevent the reproductive function through abstinence (禁欲的). However, the former is violent talk (暴論) unworthy of academic discussion, while demanding the latter, abstinence, from the majority propertyless class (無產階級), who possess no pleasure in life other than sensory gratification (感覺的亨藥), is too cruel (殘忍). Hence, the issue of artificial birth control arises, and our reality is precisely demanding this. Firstly, it will reduce weak infants facing sickness, weakness, and death, becoming a means of social reform; also, the number of members crying from hunger for education and food will decrease, and how much could the catastrophe (慘禍) of poverty be removed? We propose this issue here as well, hoping for much discussion going forward. (P'ain) <1>

**Summary**

This editorial argues for two main points concerning Korea's future under Japanese rule: the urgent need to establish a national Korean university and the necessity of implementing birth control. The author contends that a university is crucial for cultural development and national revival, even suggesting converting existing institutions like newspaper companies if funding is an issue. Secondly, citing Malthus, the author argues that birth control is a necessary measure to alleviate poverty and social distress caused by population growth outstripping food resources under current conditions, rejecting abstinence as cruel and impractical for the masses. The article is historically interesting as it reflects Korean intellectuals' aspirations for cultural self-determination (university) and their grappling with socio-economic problems (poverty, population) within the constraints of colonialism. The direct call to convert existing businesses and the frank discussion of birth control highlight the pressing concerns and proposed solutions debated during this period.

展望과 主張
○民立大學再興의 烽火
新興하는 國家民族의 例를보면 그 社會의 新文化를 先驅식히며  建設事業에 첫 礎石을 노아주는 것으로 반드시 「大學」及「大學生」을가진다. 中山大學과 黃浦軍官學校를 가진 中國과 旱稻田愛應의 兩大學을 가지든 建設期의 日本과 其他英美露愛國等 모다그러하엿슴을 본다 더구나 略少……運動에잇서 그러함에라 우리도 느진대로 우리 獨特의 文化의 創造發展及擁護을 爲하는 最高學府하나를 가져야하겟다.
率直하게말하야 우리는 現在와 가치 新聞社三個를 가진다는것보다 一二個의 新聞社와 一個의 「大學」을 가지는 것을 오히려 矜持로알며  數十中學校보다 그 幾分의 中學과 大學하나를 더가지는 것을 全軆的으로 利롭게안다 이 点에서 年十數萬圓을 消耗하는 新聞事業을 안둘을 바스어 大學으로 改鑄하여 可할것이라 모든 剩餘는 必要한 곳에 돌니어야한다. 실로 基金難으로 大學再興에 難色이잇다면 新聞社 銀行, 會社, 中等學校等 己成機關의 「大學」으로의 變形을 要求함을 누가 暴言이라하랴 우리는 굿게밋는다. 大學이 或 顚落의 「로메-터」가 되는곳이잇다할지라도 우리에게는 再興의 機關과 礎石이되는것임을! 於是乎이 問題는 問題로써 提出하는바인죽압으호 大衆의 얿고 愼重한 討議가 잇기를 바란다.
○產兒制限의 必要
우리의 貧困이 어대서오느냐 이러케도 甚힌 衣食住의 逼迫이 大軆어대서오느냐 이것을 캐자면 깁흔곳에 이르러야 하겟지만 쉽게 생각하야 人口와 食種의 比例가 均衡을 이른데서부터오는 그 原因을 重要하게 곱게된다. 그러면 食糧의 增大를 割策할수잇느냐 只今條件으로는 그는 不可能하다 이에 側面이요  消極的이나마 人口의 增加를 制限아니할수업다 그러자면 戰爭과 疫病과 大飢饉으로 이를 手術하든지 그러치 안으면 禁欲的으로 生殖作用을 막어야한다함을 「말사스」가 이미 말하엿다 그러나 前者는 暴論이라 學論할바못되거니와 后者의 禁慾이란거이 感覺的亨藥밧게 生存上娛樂을 가지지 못한 大多數의 無產階級에게 이를 强要함은 너무나 殘忍하다. 이에 人工的으로 生殖制限의 問題가 이러나게되니 우리의 現實이 正히 이것을 强要하고잇다 첫재 病弱과 死에 直面한 虛弱한 嬰兒를 減少하게되어 社會改造의 一手段이될것이요  敎育과 食糧의 飢餓에우는 成員이 적어질것이며 貧困의 慘禍인들 얼마나 除去할수 잇슬가 이 問題도 압흐로 만흔 討論가 잇기를 바라서 여기 提出하는바이다(파인)＜1＞
