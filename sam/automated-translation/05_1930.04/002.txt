Article Title: 大學構成論 農民大學이 最必要――最少 十五萬圓이면 可能―― (University Composition Theory: A Farmers' University is Most Necessary—Possible with a Minimum of 150,000 Won)
Author: 安在鴻
Article Type: 대담·좌담 (Interview/Discussion)

○Reporter: Setting aside all political and social reasons for a moment, it seems absolutely necessary that we must have at least one university established by our own hands, even just to foster our unique new cultural movement. That's why, I believe, this movement concretely arose seven or eight years ago through the efforts of our leaders. Unfortunately, due to unavoidable special circumstances, it has temporarily faced setbacks. However, this is something that must be completed swiftly, so that from it, we can pursue the research of our new culture, unify guiding theories, and cultivate outstanding talent in various fields, allowing construction projects to proceed properly. What are your views on this, sir?

○An: The movement for a People's University (民立大學) is indeed very good. However, its realization is extremely difficult. The difficult circumstances are not simple, both economically and politically. But it goes without saying that it would be good for the Korean people (朝鮮人) to have their own university. If we absolutely must do it, rather than a vague People's University, I believe we should create a Korean Farmers' University (朝鮮農民大學). Just as newly emerged nations have special universities based on new plans, and nations in periods of military rule have military academies, each arising from their specific circumstances, our society, where nearly 17 million people, comprising over 75 percent of the population, live in agricultural villages, should naturally have a Farmers' University to guide and educate the farming populace. While the aspirations for a People's University are vast, a Farmers' University does not require such enormous expenses and has a sufficient possibility of realization.

○Reporter: Then, can we consider that we have passed the era of theory and are now at the stage of embarking on actual construction? Please tell us about the organizational theory within the "plan" you have established for the construction of this Farmers' University.<2> First, what would be a good name for it?

○An: University organizational theory, you ask? Discussing organizational theory now, like preparing swaddling clothes before the baby is even born, feels premature. However, if we decide to establish a Farmers' University, let's estimate the required land: 15 *chō* (町步) of farmland (paddy and fields, including the site), at slightly over 70 *chŏn* (錢) per *p'yŏng* (坪), comes to 32,000 Won (圓). For 10 *chō* of forest land (unforested area) at 15 *chŏn* per *p'yŏng*, it's 4,500 Won. Construction costs are 30,000 Won, and equipment costs are 10,000 Won, totaling 77,500 Won. There should be considerable room for savings within these figures. If an additional reserve fund of 72,500 Won is needed, then a school could initially be established with a capital of 150,000 Won. If we aim for savings, it could even be done with 100,000 Won by significantly reducing the farmland and forest land and making the buildings modest. If we want it slightly more comfortable, 200,000 Won would suffice. However, pursuing savings makes it more feasible, wouldn't you say? The curriculum should focus on knowledge and techniques related to agriculture and forestry, especially practical experience, and careful attention must be paid to aligning it with the situation of Korean agriculture and farmers (朝鮮農業과 農民情勢). We<3>must strive not only for their conscious enlightenment but also to cultivate talent capable of being good comrades in technical and daily life matters.

○Reporter: So, it would have to be a single-discipline university, but would it eventually transform into a comprehensive university? Especially since our immediate goal is "to cultivate abundant talent in many fields" with "as little time and expense as possible," shouldn't there be a sequence in establishing university departments? For instance, delaying the establishment of single-discipline colleges like Medicine or Science as much as possible, or perhaps including departments like Engineering or Commerce together? What are your thoughts on that?

○An: Since it's a Farmers' University, it would naturally be a single-discipline university. Engineering and Commerce are also good, but I see that ultimately as just idealistic theory.

○Reporter: Next, what about the administrative structure? For example, if it's a presidential system, what kind of person should be nominated as president? How should patrons who contribute funds for the university's maintenance be treated? From what fields should the principal, directors, and council members be drawn? And what about recruiting foreign professors or training university professors? Please provide at least an outline (翰廊).

○An: Discussing even the administrative structure seems overly childish. Whether it's a president, dean, or department head is rather a matter of form. The real question is, how do we find sincere, capable, and self-sacrificing (殉道的) teachers and professors who will become comrades and brothers, working as unsung servants (無名奉仕者) for the future of the Korean people and Korean farmers? Training teachers for the Farmers' University should precede [enrolling] students for the Farmers' University. As for patrons providing funds, depending on their insight, they could become one of the school leaders, or if not, finding some way to commemorate them permanently shouldn't be difficult. And while we might recruit foreign professors where absolutely necessary, professor training would involve dispatching qualified individuals abroad for study, mutual development among colleagues to cultivate a specific ethos and sentiment, and acquiring practical knowledge (technology) through experience.

○Reporter: Yes, I understand. Then, what about the length of study? And which department should receive the most focus?

○An: The maximum length of study would be three years, and there would be special courses utilizing the agricultural off-season (農閑期), lasting two years or even one year. The main focus should be on the Farmer Guidance Department (農民敎導科), aiming to provide technical guidance, act as advisors in daily life, enlighten consciousness, and thus create fertile ground for future progress. One must be mindful not to rush things too impatiently (燥急하게), aiming only to become unsung servants.

○Reporter: Yes—I understand everything you've said. Then lastly, if the day comes when this university revival movement becomes fully concrete, to what extent are you prepared to spare no effort?

○An: I don't hold high expectations for the People's University revival movement. Years ago, I saw seniors advocating for it very passionately, but even the mood for it didn't stir. Something like a Farmers' University seems to have a possibility of realization, and its concretization must come sooner or later.<4>

**Summary**

In this 1930 interview, An Chae-hong argues that establishing a comprehensive "People's University" (Minrip Taehak) is impractical under current economic and political conditions in colonial Korea. Instead, he strongly advocates for the creation of a specialized "Farmers' University" (Nongmin Taehak) as a more feasible and necessary institution, given that over 75% of Koreans were farmers. He outlines a preliminary plan, estimating a minimum cost of 150,000 Won (potentially reducible to 100,000 Won), focusing on land acquisition, basic construction, and practical curriculum in agriculture and forestry tailored to Korean conditions. An emphasizes training selfless, dedicated instructors committed to guiding farmers in technical skills, daily life, and consciousness-raising, rather than focusing excessively on formal structures or rapid expansion. He views this targeted approach as having a greater chance of success than the broader university movement.

This article is significant for historians as it reflects pragmatic Korean nationalist aspirations for self-managed higher education under restrictive colonial rule. An Chae-hong's focus on a Farmers' University highlights the centrality of the rural question and agrarian issues in colonial Korean society and nationalist thought. His cost analysis and emphasis on feasibility reveal the severe economic constraints faced by Koreans attempting independent institution-building, while his vision for the university's role underscores a desire for practical development and empowerment tailored to the Korean majority, distinct from the colonial education system.
