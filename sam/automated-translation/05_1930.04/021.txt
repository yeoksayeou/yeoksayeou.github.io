◇Two Company Announcements

We wish to establish branches and sales offices widely, both domestically and overseas (海內海外), so interested parties, please request our internal regulations.

Occasionally, there are those who ask for magazines and books published by this company (本社) to be sent via Cash on Delivery or as samples (見樣), but we do not provide samples, and we also refuse Cash on Delivery. Please be sure to order with payment in advance. <17>

**Summary**

This article contains two announcements from the Samch'ŏlli magazine company. The first seeks interested individuals to establish branch offices and sales outlets both within Korea and abroad. The second clarifies the company's sales policy: they do not send out samples and refuse Cash on Delivery (COD), requiring advance payment for all orders of their magazines and books. From a historical perspective, this notice reveals the business aspirations of a Korean publishing house during the colonial period, aiming for expansion both domestically and internationally. It also sheds light on the logistical and financial challenges, indicated by the strict prepayment policy, possibly reflecting difficulties with payment collection or the limited infrastructure for COD services at the time.
