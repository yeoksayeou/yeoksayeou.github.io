大學人材養成論 指導者及技術者養成――小說팔아 資金援助하겟다――
						李光洙
○Reporter: If we are to start a New Culture Movement, I believe we must have at least one institution of higher learning. Although this movement arose before and was frustrated, looking back at foreign examples and our past experiences, a university established by our own hands is absolutely necessary for researching and introducing our unique culture and for training disciplined leaders. Therefore, I believe now is the time to exert all our strength to revive this movement. What are your thoughts, sir?

○Yi: In principle, its necessity is beyond argument. However, with our impoverished economic power, can its construction be possible? Frankly speaking, when this movement first began seven or eight years ago, I did not donate even a single Wŏn (一圓). The reason is, if it were something likely to succeed, I would not hesitate to offer even the clothes off my back, but what can one do about something that is doomed from the start? Even if there are five or six capitalists (資本家) who donate ten or twenty thousand Wŏn, we cannot guarantee this will necessarily succeed. Also, even if there are several hundred generous donors (篤志家) donating from one or two Wŏn up to two hundred Wŏn each, I believe we cannot guarantee it will definitely succeed. This is because, in reality (實際), such methods do not gather the large sums (大金) of hundreds of thousands or millions of Wŏn. Therefore, I see it this way: if some great wealthy person first steps up and says, "Let's do this," contributing one million or five hundred thousand Wŏn, that could become the foundation (基礎), and this project (事業) would have a sufficient possibility (可能性) of success (成就). Thus, rather than all the theories (理論), I believe the proper order (順序) is to put all our effort (全力) into finding one or two such individuals. After that, wouldn't it be right to gather donations from the general public (一般) and commence (着手) the work?

○Reporter: There is room for discussion (討議) regarding the financial aspects (財政方面), so let's leave it at that. Then, in which areas of talent cultivation (人材養成) should our university focus its efforts? That is, what kind of personnel training should be the primary justification for the necessity (必要) of establishing (設置) a university?

○Yi: Training technicians (技術者養成)! Since the development (發達) of agriculture and industry (農工業) is lacking, it seems most necessary first to train numerous agricultural technicians for the agricultural sector (農業方面) and industrial technicians for the industrial sector (工業方面). Secondly, training the leadership stratum of the populace (民衆)—in other words, politicians (政治家)—would be necessary. However, training the former, the technicians, requires considerable equipment (設備가 餘간 드는 것이 아닌즉), so we should first focus our efforts (法力) on cultivating scholars (理學者), namely individuals in the fields of physics and chemistry (物理化學方面).

○Reporter: Sir, sometime ago in your *Essay on National Reconstruction* (民族改造論), you seem to have explained the personnel needed for Chosŏn's (朝鮮) future in numerical (數字的) terms. Has that main point (主旨) changed much now?

○Yi: I still hold the same thoughts as back then. That is, by technicians, I mean firstly those who will operate (運用) the postal aspects (郵政方面) such as telegraph and telephone (電信電話等); sailors and engineers (船員 機關士) for navigation (航海) who will travel the near and distant seas of the peninsula (半島); besides them, people to operate (運＜10＞用) banks (銀行), social [unclear] (社會■場), mines (鑛山), and various factories (各工場)—practical individuals (實際의 人物) to run these. The required unit numbers (單位數字) for these can be calculated (採算) by examining the current staff count (數효) in various institutions (各機關). Another thing is, individuals who have completed what would be called the political science department (政治科) in foreign (外國) universities (大學)—that is, direct leaders (直接指導者) of the populace. It would be good to train about three hundred (約三百名) such persons, perhaps one for each small rural village and double that proportion for cities (都會). This is truly necessary; without this unit of technicians and popular leaders, one cannot feel secure about planning for the future (後日).

○Reporter: If this movement takes concrete shape (具軆化) in the future (압흐로), to what extent (程度) will you contribute your efforts (努力)?

○Yi: As I said earlier, if a major benefactor (篤志家) first comes forward contributing half or one-third of the total amount (金額), I will believe (밋고) this project has a chance of success (成算) and will not begrudge (앳기지안겟슴니다) donating money to the extent of my ability. Furthermore, I will provide utmost support (極力援助), even by writing and selling novels (小說) and poems (詩).<11>

**Summary**

This 1930 interview features Yi Kwangsu discussing the necessity and feasibility of establishing a Korean university. While agreeing on the need for such an institution for cultural development and leadership training, Yi expresses strong skepticism about funding it through widespread small donations, citing a past failure. He argues the priority should be securing a large initial donation from a wealthy benefactor. Regarding the university's focus, Yi prioritizes training technicians (agricultural, industrial) and practical leaders (politicians), suggesting an initial focus on basic sciences (physics, chemistry) due to the high cost of technical equipment. He reiterates his belief in the need for specific numbers of technicians and leaders for national development and pledges personal financial support, even selling his literary works, if the project gains a solid financial footing.

From a historical perspective, this article is revealing of the practical challenges faced by Korean nationalist movements under Japanese rule, particularly the economic constraints. Yi Kwangsu's pragmatic, almost cynical, emphasis on large capital over popular fundraising reflects the difficulties encountered. His focus on technical and practical education over purely liberal arts, and his specific mention of needing leaders akin to political science graduates, highlights perceived needs for modernization and self-governance, even within the colonial context. His conditional pledge of support, contingent on securing major funding first, might also reflect the complex position of intellectuals like him, balancing nationalist aspirations with perceived realities.
