Announcement of the 'Resurrection Issue' Publication

The next May issue will be the 'Resurrection Issue' (復活號) and will also be a special large issue (fixed price thirty chŏn (三十錢)). The content and external appearance (外形) will be edited to be even more spectacular (一層壯觀), and it will be closed for submissions early and put on sale around April 15th. Therefore, we hope everyone will hurry and place their orders (注文).

Respectfully from the Samch'ŏlli Company (三千里社白) <60>

**Summary**

This is a brief announcement from the Samch'ŏlli Company advertising its upcoming May 1930 issue, designated the 'Resurrection Issue' (復活號). It promises a special, enlarged edition with superior content and appearance for the price of 30 chŏn, releasing early around April 15th, urging readers to order promptly. From a historical perspective, the notice reflects colonial-era publishing marketing tactics. The term 'Resurrection Issue' is notable; it could imply recovery from a suspension, a significant editorial shift, or simply a thematic title, potentially carrying subtle nationalistic connotations within the constraints of the time. The price and early release schedule offer insights into the economic and operational aspects of magazine publishing then.
