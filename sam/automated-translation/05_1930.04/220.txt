With water drawn morning and evening
The rice cooked with devotion
Who eats it, who eats it?

Searching the large valley, the small valley
Clothes washed with devotion
Who wears them, who wears them?

Today too, yesterday too
The maidens of the front house, the back house
Draw water, wash clothes <59>

**Summary**

The poem "Country Maiden" depicts the diligent daily chores of young women in the countryside – fetching water, cooking rice, and washing clothes with great care and devotion. It repeatedly asks who consumes the food and wears the clothes produced through this labor, implying a sense of unnoticed or perhaps unappreciated toil. For historians, the piece offers a simple yet poignant snapshot of rural women's lives and domestic labor burdens during the Japanese colonial period in Korea. The use of older Korean spellings and the focus on routine, essential tasks highlight traditional gender roles and the often-invisible contributions of women in rural society.

아츰 저역 지른 물노
정성드레 지은 밥은
누가 먹나 누가 먹어?

누가 입나 누가 입어?

오늘도 어적게도

물깃네 옷을 빠네 ＜59＞
