夜巡探報臺

一萬圓
When the movement first arose to establish a People's University (民立大學), Mr. Han Kyusŏl (韓圭卨) of Sup'yojŏng in the city, who was a former Privy Council minister (前參政大臣), is said to have put forth ten thousand won (金壹萬圓) as funds for its establishment preparation. However, because Mr. Yu Chint'ae (兪鎭泰) kept this money a secret (秘密), many people at the time did not know where the expenses came from.

便紙한장
A single letter sent from prison by Kōtoku Shūsui (幸德秋水) to Mr. Sakai Toshihiko (堺利彦) after Kōtoku's death sentence was finalized in January of Meiji 44 (1911) was recently sold to the Ōhara Institute for Social Research (大原社會問題硏究所) for five hundred won (五百圓).

五萬圓
During the heyday of Empress Myŏngsŏng (明成后), the Russian Minister Weber (웨-버) presented fifty thousand won (五萬圓) for her birthday celebration (生誕慶節). This shows how much even foreign envoys (外國使臣) feared and also respected her at that time.

畿湖學會
Mr. Yu Chint'ae (兪鎭泰) served as the General Secretary (總務) for the Kiho Academic Society (畿湖學會) for a total of 7 years, before and after.

徐氏의 流配＜36＞
Mr. Sŏ Chŏnghŭi (徐廷禧) was once sentenced to a long exile (流配) of 10 years during the time of Old Korea (舊韓國) due to the XX Association incident, which involved a terror group. Fortunately, he was released the following year. The island was Chindo (珍島) in South Chŏlla Province (全南). Also, the leader, Kang Sangwŏn (姜相元), was exiled to Chido (智島) in South Chŏlla Province, and Min Hyŏngsik (閔衡植), who was an Assistant Councilor in the Ministry of Education (學部協叅), was exiled to Ch'ŏl-to (鐵-島) in Hwanghae Province (黃海島).

活貧黨
It is said that in the old Hwalbindang (活貧黨, Righteous Poor Party), there were two factions: the Hong Kiltong (洪吉童) faction and the Namgamyŏng faction.

密書
According to police investigation, during the time of the first Japan Communist Party (第一次 日本 共産黨), directives (指令) coming from the Third International (第三 인터나순날) were printed using a typewriter (타입푸라이다) on silk handkerchiefs about five *ch'on* long and three *ch'on* wide. Japanese party members carrying these into the country would tie them like lining to the bottom of their Western suits or attach them to the back of their white shirts (와이샷쓰) to break through the Russo-Chinese border (露中國境) and bring them all the way to Tokyo (東京).

沙漢의 꼿
The author of the serialized novel (連載小說) "Flower of the Sandy Han" (沙漢의 꼿) in the Tonga Ilbo (東亞日報) was given as Nangnim Sanin (狼林山人), but it is actually Mr. Chu Yohan (朱耀翰).

福本和夫
The pen name (벤, 네-a, i.e. pen name) of Fukumoto Kazuo (福本和夫), who for a time led the theory (이론) of the Japanese social movement, is Hōjō Kazuo (北條一雄).

一萬圓
The Japanese vocalist Fujiwara Yoshie (蕂原義江) recently signed a one-week appearance contract for a talkie (토-키) with the Tokyo ＜37＞ Motion Picture Company (東京 活動寫眞會社), and his fee (報酬) is ten thousand won (壹萬圓).

應接子
The pen names "Mangjunghanin" (忙中閑人, Idle Person Amidst Busyness) and "Man'gakt'ap" (晩覺塔, Late Awakening Pagoda) seen in the reception room (應接室) of the Tonga Ilbosa (東亞日報社) belong to the same person (仝一人), who is the acting managing editor of the company, Mr. Sŏl Ŭisik (薜義植).

爭議資金
There is talk that lawyer Kim T'aeyŏng (金泰榮), when he stepped up as acting chairman (委員長代理) during the great Wŏnsan Labor Federation (元山勞働聯合會) dispute (大爭議), took out over 2,000 won from his own pocket for the dispute expenses (爭議費用).

七十二
The number "seventy-two" (七十二) is a number that leaves many memories for people. The loyal retainers of Tumun-dong (杜門洞忠臣) at the end of Koryŏ (高麗) numbered 72, the Huanghuakang Martyrs (黃花江烈士) of China (中國) also numbered 72, and the number of Koreans who became aristocrats (貴族) at the time of the Annexation (合倂) was also 72.

「무쇠탈」의 主人
The identity of the protagonist of "The Iron Mask" (무쇠탈, Japanese name 鐵假面), widely known through the translation (飜譯) by Min Ubo (閔牛步), has been investigated (캐어왓스나) by many historians (史家) to this day. Recently, the theory that he was the twin brother (쌍둥이 동생) who shared blood with the French (佛蘭西) Emperor of the time has become prominent. This is because French politics at that time were absolutist (專制政治), where the King could let live or kill anyone he wished. Therefore, the King would customarily execute (죽여버렷다) political rebels (政治上의 反逆者). However, the King could not bring himself to kill (참아 죽이지 못하고) the Man in the Iron Mask, instead making him live his whole life in prison with a mask made of iron covering his face (얼골에 씨워서), allowing him to die naturally. This is said to be evidence (증거인가) that it is thicker than tears of blood (피눈물보다 더거다는 - likely referring to the bond of blood being strong). In any case, it can be called an interesting story.

梅蘭芳의 校長
With the support (后援) of Professor Li Shih-tseng (李石會氏) of Peking University (北平大學敎授) and others, a specialized drama school (演劇專門學校) called the Peking Academy of Traditional Chinese Opera (北平戱曲學院) has recently been established in Peking (北平). The famous actor Mei Lanfang (梅蘭芳氏, age 37) is said to become the principal (校長). <40> <36-40>

**Summary**

This article, titled "Night Patrol Report Platform," presents a collection of short news items, anecdotes, and gossip from 1930. Topics range from a secret donation for the People's University by Han Kyusŏl, the sale of a letter by Kōtoku Shūsui, a large gift to Empress Myŏngsŏng by a Russian diplomat, Yu Chint'ae's role in the Kiho Academic Society, the exile of Sŏ Chŏnghŭi and others involved in an anti-Japanese group, factions within the historical Hwalbindang, methods used by Japanese communists to smuggle directives from the Comintern, the real author behind a pen name for a Tonga Ilbo serial, the pen name of socialist theorist Fukumoto Kazuo, a high fee for vocalist Fujiwara Yoshie, pen names used by Tonga Ilbo editor Sŏl Ŭisik, lawyer Kim T'aeyŏng's contribution to the Wŏnsan strike fund, the significance of the number 72 in Korean and Chinese history, speculation about the Man in the Iron Mask, and the appointment of Mei Lanfang as principal of a new drama school in Peking.

For historians of colonial Korea, this collection offers glimpses into various facets of society: the ongoing nationalist sentiment (People's University movement, mention of anti-Japanese activities like Sŏ Chŏnghŭi's), connections to international leftist movements (Comintern directives), the cultural scene (literary pseudonyms, Japanese entertainers, Peking opera), reflections on pre-colonial history (Empress Myŏngsŏng, Hwalbindang, Koryŏ loyalists), and social commentary (the number 72, the Wŏnsan strike). The mix of political, social, cultural, and historical tidbits provides a snapshot of the information environment and interests of the readership of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine during this period.
