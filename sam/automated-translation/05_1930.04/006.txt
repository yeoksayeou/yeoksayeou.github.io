◇Upper 元佳節 (First Full Moon Festival)
By P'yŏngyang Gisaeng Chuksŏ (竹西)

Spring snow not yet melted, the cold not yet gone,
Poets and disciples relax their wine cups.
Knowing you, tonight there is no need for sleep,
As the moon rises over plum blossoms, let us rejoice together.

◇喜雨 (Joyful Rain)
By Puan Gisaeng Pokkae (福介)

A few welcome dark clouds (玄雲) rise from distant peaks,
All day long, they fill the sky, perfectly thick.
Suddenly transforming into rain for the human world,
Moistening the fields full of autumn crops.

◇哀別 (Sorrowful Parting)
By Ŭiju Gisaeng, Name Unknown (失名氏)

Go, go in peace, go,
Long, long is the journey of ten thousand *ri*.
On a night when the river and sky are moonless,
What of the lonely cry (孤呌) of the wild goose?

◇白馬 懷古 (Paengma, Reflections on the Past)
By Hosŏ Gisaeng Ch'uhyang (秋香)

Mooring late at Koran Temple (皐蘭寺),
In the west wind, I lean alone upon the pavilion.
The dragon perished, clouds eternal;
Flowers fall, the moon endures for a thousand autumns. <11>

**Summary**

This article presents four short poems (Hansi) composed by Gisaeng from different regions of Korea (P'yŏngyang, Puan, Ŭiju, Hosŏ region). The poems touch upon themes of seasonal celebration (First Full Moon Festival), the welcome arrival of rain for agriculture, the sorrow of parting, and historical reflection inspired by a specific location (Paengma River/Koran Temple, evoking the fall of the Paekche kingdom). These poems showcase the literary skills and emotional depth of Gisaeng. From a colonial history perspective, the publication of these works in a popular magazine like *Samch'ŏlli* is significant. It highlights the continued cultural role and artistic contributions of Gisaeng during the Japanese occupation, offering a glimpse into their perspectives and preserving a part of Korean traditional literary expression during a period of intense cultural pressure and change.
