Past History: The Course of the People's University Movement
						Kim Tong-hwan

One,
On the morning of March 29, 1924, at the Great Hall of the Kyŏngsŏng Chongno Central YMCA Hall, with the late Mr. Yi Sang-jae as chairman and Mr. Yi Sŭng-hun as vice-chairman, several hundred figures from the peninsula gathered for a great meeting filled with national emotion; this was the founding assembly of the People's University that left its mark on recent history.
Prior to this, in November of the previous year, figures such as Yi Sang-jae, Chang Tŏk-su, Ch'oe Rin, Yi Sŭng-hun, Yu Chin-t'ae, Han Yong-un, Kang In-t'aek, and Hong Sŏng-sŏl proposed establishing a People's University institution for nurturing talent as the first cornerstone of constructive work following the March 1st Movement. In response, over 1,200 patriots from more than 230 counties and townships across all of Chosŏn rose up, their spirit exceedingly strong and their sincerity truly earnest. Thus, following the promoters' meeting, the founding assembly was held for three days starting on the aforementioned March 29th in central Kyŏngsŏng.
As a result, over a thousand patriots pledged to devote their utmost effort, body and soul, to the historic undertaking of establishing the nation's highest educational institution, and the founding assembly concluded without incident. Such an emotionally charged scene has likely been rare in our history.

Two,
So, how was the university to be completed? The thousand-odd individuals gathered at the aforementioned assembly discussed and decided upon the following draft plan:
One, Let us raise the People's University's basic fund of ten million won with our own hands!
One, The institution shall be a comprehensive university. In the first phase, we will establish the Faculty of Law and Literature; in the second phase, the Medical College and Science College; and in the third phase, the Agricultural College and Engineering College, thus completing a five-unit comprehensive university!
Thus, they began the collection of the ten million won basic fund as the priority issue. For this purpose, People's University branches were established throughout Chosŏn, and a Central Executive Committee was set up in Seoul. Virtually every influential figure interested in cultural endeavors became involved in this movement, encompassing many wealthy individuals and talented people. For reference, the members of the Central Committee included:
▲Yi Sang-jae ▲Cho Man-sik ▲Yi Sŭng-hun ▲Yu Sŏng-jun ▲Yu Chin-t'ae ▲Han Yong-un ▲Hong Sŏng-sŏl ▲Yi Kap-sŏng
and others. Furthermore, regarding the university funds, fearing that unforeseen problems might arise if the collected money was gathered in one place, strict restrictions were placed on each branch, having designated custodians manage the funds individually. It was decided that only when enough funds were collected to start the first phase would the entire amount be brought together in the Kyŏngsŏng Central Office to begin the work; thus, the precautions were thorough.

Three,
In this way, the movement to establish the highest educational institution took concrete shape and practical steps began. The figures from various strata who had concluded the assembly quickly dispersed to their respective regions, striving to arouse public opinion greatly. They planned to hold county-level mass meetings in counties and township-level mass meetings in townships to gain spiritual and material support. As a result, effects exceeding expectations appeared, and soon, the joyous news spread that a large sum of approximately 600,000 won had been collected.
Here, I will record what I heard through the mouth of a certain individual who was in a key position in this movement at the time, formulating the highest strategies. That is, of the ten million won, the plan was to collect four million won in the first phase, three million won in the second phase, and one million won in the third phase to prepare the university's site, buildings, and training for professors of Law and Literature. The goal was to collect that four million won within three years, that is, by 1927, with the main effort focused on the five provinces of Chŏlla, Hwanghae, and P'yŏngan. Therefore, the aforementioned 600,000 won collected shortly after was mostly gathered from these five provinces. Among them, the results from Kimje and Posŏng were particularly excellent, with each county alone reportedly collecting over 100,000 won (I later heard that after the university movement was thwarted, some villages used that money to establish secondary education institutions instead).
While progressing so smoothly, a heart-wrenching event for our national culture—a matter of profound regret echoing through a thousand years—occurred. In the following year, an unprecedented great drought struck all of Chosŏn, and furthermore, in the year after that, the greatest flood seen in fifty years hit various regions starting with the Samnam area, causing extreme damage to crops, people, and livestock. Both rural villages and cities became desolate. In such circumstances, how could there be any vitality left to continue this project? The suffering was not limited to natural disasters; interference from a certain quarter (某邊) also gradually intensified, leading inevitably to the tearful suspension [of the movement], which continues to this day.<13>

**Summary**

This 1930 article by Kim Tong-hwan recounts the rise and fall of the Korean People's University Movement initiated in 1923-1924. Led by prominent figures like Yi Sang-jae, it aimed to establish a national university funded by Koreans (goal: 10 million won) as a constructive post-March 1st Movement effort. The movement gained widespread support, established a fundraising structure, and initially collected significant funds (around 600,000 won), particularly from the Chŏlla, Hwanghae, and P'yŏngan provinces. However, severe natural disasters (drought and floods) in consecutive years devastated the country, crippling the fundraising efforts. The article also mentions unspecified external "interference," likely referring to Japanese colonial suppression, as a contributing factor to the movement's eventual failure. From a historical perspective, the article vividly illustrates a significant, non-violent nationalist effort focused on education and self-reliance during the colonial period. It highlights the broad base of support for such initiatives, the practical challenges faced (economic hardship, natural disasters), and the implicit but palpable pressure from the colonial authorities that ultimately thwarted this ambition for national higher education.

過去來歷 民立大學運動의 經過
						金東煥

一,
一千九百二十四年三月二十九日아츰에 京城鍾路中中央靑年會舘大廣間에서 故李商在氏議長 李昇薰氏副議長으로 半島의 數百人士가 모여서 民族的感激의 一大會議가 열니엇섯스니 이것이 即近世史上에 記憶을 치든 民立大學創立大會이다.
先是하야 그 前年十一月에 李商在 張德秀 崔麟 李昇薰 兪鎭泰 韓龍雲 姜仁澤 洪性偰等諸氏의 입으로부터 三一運動의 뒤를이어서 建設事業의 첫 礎石으로 人材養成의 民立大學機關을 設置하자는 議가이러나매 全朝鮮二百三十餘郡邑으로부터 一千二百餘有志가 ■應蹶起하여 그 意氣가 甚히 壯한바잇고 精誠이 眞逼한바잇섯다 이리하야 發起人大會와 繼續하여 創立大會를 前記三月二十九日부터 三日間을 京城中央에 開催하게된터이다.
그 結果千餘有志가 粉骨猝身으로 各自心血을다하야 民族的最高學府의 歷史的事業에 盡力하기를 誓하고 創立大會를 無事히 마첫스니아마 우리 史上에 이와가튼 感激的場面은 드물엇슬 것이다.

二,
그러면 大學을 엇더케 完成하겟느냐? 前記大會에 모엿든 千餘人士는 이러한 計劃草案을 論議決定하엿든 것이다.
一, 民立大學基本金一千萬圓을 우리손으로 모으자!
一, 學府은 綜合大學으로하되 第一期에는 法文學部를 만들고 第二期에는 法文學部를 만들고 第二期에는 醫科大學 理科大學을 만들고 第三期에는 農科大學 工科大學을 만들어 五單位綜合大學을 完成하자!
이리하야 先決問題로 基本金一千萬圓의 蒐集에 着手하게되니 그 機關으로 朝鮮各地에 民立大學支部를 두고 서울에 中央執行委員를 두게되엇다 文化事業에 關心을 가진 有力한 人士치고 이 運動에 關係를 아니매즌분이 업스러만치 財產家와 人材들을 만히 綱羅하엿다 이제 參考로 中央部委員의 얼골을 보면
▲李商在 ▲曺晩植 ▲李昇薰 ▲兪星濬 ▲兪鎭泰 ▲韓龍雲 ▲洪性偰 ▲李甲成
등 諸氏엇섯다 그러고 大學基金에 對하야 蒐集된 金員을 一處에 모아두면 ＜12＞하지아니한 일이생길가겁내여 各支部에 嚴重한 制限으로된 保管委員을 식혀서 各自 保管식히게하엿고 그런뒤 第一期事業을 시작할만하게 金額이모일에 그 全部를 京城中央部에 모혀올려다가 일에 着手하기로된터이니 用意는 周到하엿다할 것이엇다.

三,
이리하야 最高學府設置運動은 아조 具軆化하여 實地로 着手하기로되어 大會를 了한 各層人士는하로 急히 各自地方에 흐리저서 크게 輿論의 喚起을 하여 郡이면 郡民大會를 面이면 面民大會를 開催하여 精神的 物質的聲援을 엇기로되엇다. 그 結果 所期以上의 效果가나타나서 얼마잇지아니하여 約六十餘萬圓의 巨額이 모혓다는 깁분 消息이 퍼지게 되엇다.
나는 여기에서 當時 이 運動의 要地에 잇서 最高經倫을 마련하고잇든 人士中 한분인 某氏의 입을 通하야드른말을 記錄하겟다 그것은 即 壹千萬圓中 第一期에 四百萬圓第二期三百萬圓 第三期百萬圓을모아서 大學의 基地와 建物과 法文學敎授養成等을 하려하엿는뎨 그 四百萬圓이란 돈은 三年以內 即 一千九百二十七年지에 모으되 主力을 全羅 黃海 平安의 五道에 너키로하엿다한다 그래서 未幾에 모힌 前記六十餘萬圓도 五道에서 모힌 것이 大部分이엇다는데 그중에도 金堤나 寶城의 成績의 尤好하여 各各十餘萬圓式自郡에서만 모엿더라한다(大學運動이 挫折되자 고을에서는 그돈으로 中等敎育機關을 代置하엿다는 말을 뒤에들엇다)
이러케 順調로 進行하여 赫赫한 民族文化의 遺恨-千載에 흐르는 痛恨事가 이러낫섯스니 그는 그 翌年에 全朝鮮에 稀有의 大旱災가 襲來하고  繼續하여 그 再翌年에는 五日年來처음보는 大水災가 三南을 爲始하야 各地方에잇서서 五穀과 人馬의 被害-其極에 達하야 農村과 都市 모다 荒하게되매 어느겨울에 이 事業을 繼續할 生意가 잇섯스랴 受難은 天時에 치지아니하고 繼續하여 某邊의 干涉도 漸甚하여짐애 一時눈물을 머금고 頓挫의 不得已에 이르러 今日에 及한 것이엇다.＜13＞
