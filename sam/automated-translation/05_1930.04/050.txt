名妓餘香

廣寒樓

乍擲金梭懶上樓
珠簾高掛桂花秋
牛郞一去無消息
烏鵲橋邊夜夜愁

Lingering Fragrance of Famous Kisaeng

Kwanghallu Pavilion
By Kyewŏl, Kisaeng of Namwŏn

Suddenly tossing aside the golden shuttle, too lazy to ascend the pavilion,
Jeweled blinds hang high, an autumn of cassia blossoms.
The Herdsman (牛郞) left once and there is no news,
Beside the Magpie Bridge (烏鵲橋), sorrow night after night.

三君
桃花作

洛東江上初逢君
普濟院頭更別君
桃花落地紅無跡
明月何時不憶君

Samgun (You, My Lord / Three Meetings)
By Tohwa

On the Naktong River, I first met you, my lord.
At the head of Poje'wŏn, I parted from you again.
Peach blossoms (桃花) fall to the ground, red without a trace;
When does the bright moon not remind me of you?

솔이
松伊作

솔이라 솔이라니 무삼솔로만 넉이든가.
千仞絶壁에 落落長松 내긔로라.
길아래 樵童의 졉낫치야 걸어볼 줄이시라. ＜21＞

Sori (Pine Needle)
By Songi

"Pine, pine," they say, but do you think I am just any pine?
On a thousand-fathom cliff, the tall, solitary pine (落落長松) – that is I!
The folding sickle (졉낫) of the woodcutter boy (樵童) below the path – would it dare try to hook me? <21>

**Summary**

This article presents three short poems attributed to *kisaeng* (female entertainers) named Kyewŏl, Tohwa, and Songi. Kyewŏl's poem, set at the famous Kwanghallu pavilion, expresses sorrow and longing using imagery from the Kyŏnu and Chingnyŏ legend. Tohwa's poem reflects on meeting and parting, using her own name ("Peach Blossom") metaphorically to speak of fleeting moments and enduring memory. Songi's poem, a *sijo*, asserts pride and resilience, comparing herself to an inaccessible pine tree on a high cliff, looking down on those who might dismiss her. For historians, this piece offers a glimpse into the literary expression and perceived inner lives of *kisaeng* during the colonial period. Songi's poem, in particular, is interesting for its strong assertion of self-worth and dignity against potential societal disregard, challenging stereotypes of the passive or solely lamenting female entertainer.
