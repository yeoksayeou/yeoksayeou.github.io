Is thirty also youth?
Oh my, then this body is youth too.
The flowers blooming this year are flowers
I shall go find your house.

Bunch by bunch, Haedanghwa (海棠花)
Do not wither until I come.
Even if you wither,
Become fruit and remain attached.<30>

**Summary**

This short poem, titled "Youth" (靑春), reflects on the concept of age and enduring vitality. The speaker, perhaps surprised to consider thirty as still youthful, resolves to embrace this notion and visit someone (presumably a loved one), likening their endurance to the Haedanghwa flower, urging it to stay vibrant or at least bear fruit until their arrival. From a historical perspective, the poem offers a glimpse into personal sentiments during the colonial period. The contemplation of youth and vitality, coupled with the use of traditional Korean imagery like the Haedanghwa flower, might reflect a subtle longing for persistence and continuity amidst the challenging circumstances of the era. The simple, direct language contrasts with more overtly political or nationalistic themes sometimes found in literature of the time, providing insight into more personal reflections on life and time.
