Chat Room

**Husband's Name**

Ok-hwa: "Hey, I hear you got married again. Who is it this time?"
Ch'ae-bong: (After rummaging through her handbag for a while) "Well, who was it... I put his business card (名啣) in here somewhere..."

**A Death Row Inmate's Wit (名智)**

Just before ascending the execution platform, upon being asked if there was anything he wanted to eat:
Death Row Inmate: "There's just one thing I really want to eat."
Warden (典獄): "Alright, since it's your last request, I'll give you anything. What do you want to eat? Rice cake? Noodles? Makgeolli?"
Death Row Inmate: "No. I just want one peach (복송아)." It was the middle of winter (dongjitdal, 11th lunar month), so there was no way (理) peaches were available.
Warden: "What peaches are there in the dead of winter? They won't be around until May or June next year (明年)."
Death Row Inmate: "That's why it's okay if you don't give it to me now. I'm fine with waiting until next May."

**The Year Is**

Teacher: "How many seasons (季節) are there in a year?"
Student: "There are two."
Teacher: "Two? Name them."
Student: "Baseball season, Football season."

**How to Get a Hat Bought**

Wife (passing by a hat shop): "Look here. Sometimes I think how nice it would be if I were a man."
Husband: "When do you think that?"
Wife: "Times like today, when passing by a women's hat shop (婦人帽子店). Thinking how satisfied (滿足) one would feel buying a new hat (帽子) to give to one's own wife (自己妻)... See?"

**"Regarding the Matter" (關한 件) Movement**

A prominent (有力) social activist (社會運動家) somewhere was arrested (檢擧) by the police (警察) and was undergoing interrogation (訊問), but every question pertained to absurd incidents.
"You did such-and-such, didn't you?"
"I did no such thing."
"Then you did so-and-so, didn't you?"
"Absolutely (絶對) not."
"Well then, generally (大體), what kind of work *did* you do?"
"I participated in the 'Regarding the Matter' (關한件) movement."
The 'Regarding the Matter Movement' refers to the activism seen on paper (紙上運動) during various meetings (大會), often phrased as "Regarding the Matter of X," "Regarding the Matter of Y." This is how the gentleman cleverly (巧妙) expressed (表現) it. <63>

**Summary**

This article presents a collection of five short, humorous anecdotes reflecting everyday life and social observations in 1931 Korea. The jokes cover topics like forgetfulness in marriage, the wit of a death row inmate delaying his fate, a child's modern interpretation of seasons through sports, a wife's subtle hint for a new hat, and a social activist's clever deflection during police interrogation by referring to his work as the bureaucratic "'Regarding the Matter' Movement." From a historical perspective, the anecdotes offer glimpses into popular culture (baseball, football), social norms (marriage, shopping), and the underlying political tension of the colonial era, particularly highlighted by the final story involving police interrogation and the ambiguous nature of "social activism," which might hint at the constraints and risks faced by activists, or simply mock the bureaucratic jargon common at the time.
