The Day After the Wedding

Groom: "Oh, please stop crying. It's really off-putting."
Bride, lifting her face suddenly: "What? Until yesterday, you said there was even more charm in crying. Was that a lie?"

Poktong's Logic

Mother: "Hey, why are you snatching and eating your older sister's snack? Shouldn't you just coax her for it?"
Poktong: "She wouldn't give it even when I coaxed her, so I had no choice but to snatch it."<99>

**Summary**

This article presents two short jokes. The first concerns a newlywed couple, where the groom finds his wife's crying off-putting the day after the wedding, despite having previously found it charming, highlighting the fickle nature of compliments or the shift in perspective after marriage. The second joke features a child named Poktong justifying snatching his sister's snack because coaxing failed, presenting a child's straightforward, albeit flawed, logic. For historians, these jokes offer a small glimpse into social interactions (marriage dynamics, parent-child communication) and humor in 1930s Korea. The language itself, with its older spellings, is also of linguistic interest.
