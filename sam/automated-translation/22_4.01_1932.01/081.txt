Urgent Notice

If a Samch'ŏlli branch office has not yet been established in your esteemed region, please, esteemed Sir (先生), make an effort and establish one (Internal regulations will be presented).

From the Samch'ŏlli Company (三千里社白) <27>

**Summary**

This brief notice is an urgent appeal from the Samch'ŏlli publishing company (Samch'ŏlli Sa) to its readers, asking individuals in regions without a local branch office to take the initiative and establish one. The company promises to provide the necessary internal regulations upon request. This reveals Samch'ŏlli's active strategy to expand its distribution network across Korea during the colonial period by soliciting local agents or branch managers directly from its readership. Historians might find this interesting as it shows a Korean cultural enterprise's method for business expansion under Japanese rule, highlighting a reliance on reader participation and local initiative to grow its reach.
