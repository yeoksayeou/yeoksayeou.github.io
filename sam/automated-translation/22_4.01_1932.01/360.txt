Selected Translations of Kim Sakkat's Poems
						Yi Ŭng-su

Below, I present a selection of several poems by Kim Sakkat, extracted from my notebook, along with their general meaning.
It has already been two years since Kim Sakkat was first mentioned, and five or six years have passed since I began collecting Kim Sakkat's poems, yet I still haven't managed to compile a single volume of his posthumous works. Alas, I feel rather ashamed, but considering my unavoidable circumstances compelling me to stay secluded in a humble alley, this seems to be the greatest reason why it is difficult to carry out my initial intention as I wish. It is hard for me to discern whether my interest in Kim Sakkat stemmed from a vain desire for fame or whether there was sincere devotion, however small, for the unfortunate deceased poet or for the fading literary brilliance of Chosŏn. In any case, since I have already started this work, I intend to surely complete one volume of his collected works and am proceeding with this small endeavor. I repeatedly request that readers offer even the slightest assistance to my efforts. My address is:
No. 53, Hadŏk-ri, Rear of Hŭngnam Station.

Ascending Hamhŭng's Kujŏn Pavilion

1. 人登樓閣臨九天 / Man ascends the pavilion, overlooking the nine heavens,
馬渡長橋踏萬歲 / A horse crosses the long bridge, treading Mansae.
2. 山疑野狹遠遠立 / Mountains, suspecting the plains are narrow, stand far, far away,
水畏舟行淺淺流 / Water, fearing the passage of boats, flows shallowly, shallowly.

3. 山意龍盤虎踞形 / The mountain's aspect: a coiled dragon, a crouching tiger's form,
樓閣鸞飛鳳翼勢 / The pavilion's structure: a simurgh taking flight, a phoenix wing's power.

此 1句 未知 / This one line is unknown.

General Meaning—A person ascends the pavilion; this is the famous Kujŏn Pavilion in Hamhŭng Castle. A horse crosses the long bridge; this is the Mansae Bridge. The mountains, suspecting the plains might become narrow, retreat far into the distance and stand there. The water, fearing boat travel, flows very shallowly. (The shallowness of the Ch'ŏngch'ŏn River has been famous since ancient times).
The mountain's spirit and name suggest P'anyong Mountain (Coiled Dragon Mountain), but it doesn't quite resemble a coiled dragon; it has the shape of a crouching tiger. The pavilion is said to resemble a flying simurgh (鸞鳥), but in truth, it looks like a phoenix spreading its wings. (Could any reader who knows the following line please let me know?)

Anbyŏn P'yoyŏn Pavilion

1. 一城踏罷有高樓 / Having trod through the whole castle town, there stands a high pavilion,
覓酒題詩問幾流 / Seeking wine, writing poems, I ask how many streams there are.

2. 古木多情黃鳥至 / Old trees, full of feeling, where yellow orioles arrive,
大江無恙白鷗飛 / The great river, unharmed, where white gulls fly.

3. 英雄過去風煙盡 / Heroes have passed, wind and smoke have ceased,
客子登臨歲月悠 / A traveler ascends, the years stretch long.

4. 宿債關東猶來了 / The old debt from Kwandong [not fully seeing Kŭmgang] has yet to be settled,
欲隨征雁下長洲 / I wish to follow the migrating geese down to Changju.


1. 飄然亭子出長堤 / The P'yoyŏn Pavilion juts out from a corner of the long embankment,
鶴去樓空鳥獨啼 / The crane has gone, the pavilion empty, only birds cry alone.

2. 十里煙霞橋上下 / Ten ri of mist and haze, bridges above and below,
一天風月水東西<110> / One sky of wind and moon, water east and west. <110>

3. 神仙蹤跡雲過幽 / Traces of immortals, hidden after clouds passed,
遠客襟懷歲暮會 / A distant traveler's feelings meet the year's end.

4. 羽化門前無問處 / Before the gate of ascension, there's nowhere to ask,
蓬萊消息夢中迷 / News of P'englai [the immortals' abode] is lost in dreams.

General Meaning—After exploring the whole castle town of Anbyŏn, there is a high pavilion; this is the P'yoyŏn Pavilion, built to commemorate the trace of the P'englai immortal who ascended to heaven riding a crane. On the pavilion, I seek wine, compose a poem, and ask how many rivers there are in Anbyŏn. Old trees are affectionate, so yellow orioles come to rest; the great river, the Namdae River, is unharmed, so white gulls fly. Heroes are gone, the wind and smoke have vanished; as travelers ascend time and again, the years are long. I still have an old debt from the Kwandong region—not having fully seen the Kŭmgang Mountains on a previous visit—so now I intend to follow the migrating geese down to Changju.

The P'yoyŏn Pavilion protrudes at a corner of the long embankment. After the crane carried the immortal away and flew off, the pavilion is empty, and only common birds cry. Within ten ri of mist and haze, there are bridges above and below; under one sky of wind and moon, the water flows east [and west? Text says 東亞, likely meant 東西]. The tracks of the immortals are distant and hidden after the clouds passed; at year's end, the distant traveler's heart is filled with vague feelings. There is nowhere to inquire before the gate where the P'englai immortal ascended (羽化門前); news of him is but a dim thing in dreams.

Untitled (According to Mr. Kim Chae-ch'ŏl)

1. 許多韻字何呼覓 / Among so many rhyme characters, why call out 'myŏk' (覓)?
彼覓有難況此覓 / He seeks (覓) difficulty, how much more so with this 'myŏk'?

2. 一夜宿寢懸於覓 / A night's lodging hangs on this 'myŏk',
山村訓長但知覓 / This village schoolmaster seems only to know 'myŏk'.

General Meaning—Kim Sakkat went somewhere and sought lodging for a night. The host said he would grant the request if Kim composed a poem. This is a quatrain composed according to the rhyme character (覓, myŏk) called out by the host.
There are so many rhyme characters, why call out 'myŏk' (to seek/find)? He asks for trouble (the literal meaning of 覓 is 'to seek'), so how can I possibly rise to this challenge of the peculiar rhyme 'myŏk'? A night's lodging depends on this single character 'myŏk'; this mountain village schoolmaster seems to only know the character 'myŏk'.

Poem for the Poor Kisaeng

1. 可憐行色可憐身 / Pitiful appearance, pitiful body,
可憐門前訪可憐 / Before Karyŏn's (可憐) gate, visiting Karyŏn (可憐).

2. 可憐此意傳可憐 / Oh pitifully, convey this feeling to Karyŏn (可憐),
可憐能知可憐心 / Karyŏn (可憐) will surely know this pitiful (可憐) heart.

General Meaning—This appeals to the emotions of a kisaeng named 'Karyŏn' (可憐, meaning pitiful/lovely).
The two 'Karyŏn's in the first line (起句) mean 'pitiful' in the literal sense. The two 'Karyŏn's in the second line (承句) are the kisaeng's name, Karyŏn. The first 'Karyŏn' in the third line (轉句) is an adverb meaning 'pitifully'; the second 'Karyŏn' is the kisaeng's name. The first 'Karyŏn' in the last line (結句) is the kisaeng's name; the second 'Karyŏn' is the original meaning of Karyŏn, 'pitiful heart'.
A pitiful body with a pitiful appearance visited Karyŏn at Karyŏn's gate. Pitifully, if I convey this feeling to Karyŏn, surely Karyŏn will understand my pitiful heart.

Untitled

1. 邑號開城何閉門 / The town's name is Kaesŏng (Open Castle), why is the gate closed?
山名松獄豈無薪 / The mountain's name is Songak (Pine Peak), how can there be no firewood?

2. 黃昏逐客非人事 / Chasing out a guest at dusk is not humane,
禮義東方子獨秦 / In the Eastern Land of Courtesy, you alone are Qin [Shi Huang].

General Meaning—Again, in Kaesŏng, he requested lodging for a night at a certain house. The owner drove him out and closed the gate, making excuses like having no firewood to make a fire. This verse laments the painful rejection.
The town is named Kaesŏng (Open Castle), you rotten fellow, why did you close the gate?
The mountain's name is Songak Mountain, surely covered densely with pine trees, so what do you mean there's no firewood? Chasing out a guest at dusk is not a humane act (人事); in Chosŏn, known as the Eastern Land of Courtesy (禮義東方), you alone are clearly the tyrant Qin Shi Huang.

Lazy Wife

1. 無病無憂洗浴稀 / Neither sick nor worried, she rarely bathes,
十年猶着嫁時衣 / For ten years, she still wears the clothes from her wedding day.

2. 乳連褓兒謀午睡 / Nursing the swaddled baby, she plans her afternoon nap,
收拾裙風愛簷暉 / Picking lice from her skirt, she loves the sunshine under the eaves.

3. 動身便碎廚中器 / Moving her body, she immediately breaks kitchenware,
搔首愁看壁上機 / Scratching her head, she worriedly looks at the loom on the wall.

4. 忽聞隣家神祀慰 / Suddenly hearing of a ritual offering at the neighbor's house,
柴門半掩走如飛<111> / Leaving the brushwood gate half-closed, she runs as if flying. <111>

General Meaning—A lazy wife (懶婦) who is neither sick nor worried! She doesn't even bathe, so her body is dirty, and her clothes—for ten years, day after day, she only wears the clothes from her wedding; she never wears newly made clothes. This is because she hates making clothes. She nurses the swaddled baby and always schemes for an afternoon nap. She picks lice (이) from her skirt (裙裳) in her palm and settles down under the eaves where the sunlight shines brightly. As soon as her clumsy body moves, she breaks kitchen utensils. She doesn't weave cloth; the loom (機) hangs on the wall, and she just scratches her head worrisomely. Yet, if she suddenly senses a ritual offering (祀神際) happening at the neighbor's house, she leaves the brushwood gate half-closed and runs off as if flying.

Sleepy Wife

1. 西隣愚婦睡方濃 / The foolish wife next door is fast asleep,
不識蠶工況也農 / Unaware of sericulture, let alone farming.

2. 機閑尺布三朝識 / The loom idle, a foot of cloth takes three mornings,
杵倦升粮半日舂 / The pestle tired, a升 (seung) of grain takes half a day to pound.

3. 弟衣秋盡猶稱搗 / Younger brother's clothes, though autumn ends, she still talks of fulling,
姑襪冬過每語縫 / Mother-in-law's socks, though winter passes, she always talks of sewing.

4. 蓬髮拓面形如鬼 / Tangled hair covering her face, form like a ghost,
偕老家中却恨逢 / The family who must live with her lifelong laments having met this foolish wife.

General Meaning—The foolish wife (愚婦) in the neighboring house is currently deep in her afternoon nap. This foolish wife knows neither sericulture (蠶工) nor farming. It takes her three mornings to weave one foot (尺) of cloth, and half a day to pound one *seung* (升) of grain; thus, the loom is always idle, and the pestle (杵) always rests unused. She doesn't make her younger brother's clothes even by the end of autumn, just muttering, "I need to full them, I need to full them." She doesn't make her mother-in-law's socks (버선) even as winter passes, always chattering, "I need to sew them, I need to sew them."
With tangled hair covering her face (蓬髮拓面), her form is like a ghost. The family members who must grow old with her deeply lament encountering this foolish wife.

Playfully Presented to Wife and Concubine

1. 不熱不寒二月天 / Neither hot nor cold, the second lunar month sky,
一妻一妾最堪憐 / One wife, one concubine, most pitiable.

2. 鴛鴦枕上三頭並 / On the mandarin duck pillow, three heads align,
翡翠衾中六臂連 / In the kingfisher quilt, six arms connect.

3. 開口笑時渾似品 / When they open mouths to laugh, it wholly resembles the character 品,
翻身臥處變成川 / Turning over to lie down, their forms become the character 川.

4. 東邊未了西邊事 / Before finishing business on the east side, starts the west side's affair,
更向東邊打玉拳 / Again turning to the east side, gives a gentle tap with a jade fist.

General Meaning—The early spring second lunar month sky, neither hot nor cold—a time when even widows are said to get restless—is the most pitiable season for a wife and concubine living together in one house. But on the mandarin duck pillow where a couple should sleep, the concubine is included, so three heads (三頭) line up side-by-side, and within the kingfisher quilt, six limbs (六臂 - likely means six legs, not arms) connect. When the three open their mouths (口) to laugh, it perfectly forms the character '品' (品 has three 口 components). When they turn over and lie down, the shape of the three bodies creates the character '川' (川). The man, before finishing his business on the east side (東邊事), starts the west side's affair (西邊事), and turning back to the east side, he gently nudges her with his jade hand (玉手 - figuratively 'jade fist').

Seaside Village Scene

1. 翠靄西分赤日東 / Green mist parts in the west, the red sun [rises] in the east,
四隣稠密機椽同 / Four neighbors dense, yet rafters [families] different. [Original text interpretation seems slightly off, 机椽同 could mean same style houses]

2. 山光半入漁人船 / Mountain light half enters the fishermen's boats,
海利全滿賈客銅 / Sea profits entirely fill the merchants' copper [coins].

3. 靜處希音風過萩 / In quiet places, rare sounds: wind passes through the bush clover,
霽時淸景月來桐 / When cleared, a pure scene: moon comes to the paulownia tree.

4. 箇中亦有觀瀾室 / Among them, there is also a 'wave-viewing room' [likely a study/school],
多少兒童講原崇 / Many children are studying Wonsong [? meaning unclear].

General Meaning—In the fishing village where green mist parts in the west and the red sun rises in the east in the morning, houses are densely packed. However, they are all of different surnames; there seem to be no large clans of the same surname. The mountain's reflection falls halfway into the fishing boats, and all the profits from the sea (海利) go into the merchants' pockets (囊中). In quiet places, there are few sounds, but the wind rustles through the bush clover leaves (萩葉). When the weather clears, the clear scene of the bright moon shining down on the paulownia tree is also lovely. Among these, there is also a splendid village schoolroom (書堂房), where several children are studying texts (講).
The meaning of Wonsong (原崇) is unclear. Sung (崇) can be related to Song (宋, Song Dynasty China), but the meaning of Won (原) cannot be deciphered.

Mountain Excursion

1. 蹇馬看山好 / A lame horse is good for viewing mountains,
持鞭故不加 / Holding the whip, intentionally not urging it on.

2. 岩邊纔一路 / By the cliffside, barely a single path,
姻處或三家 / Where smoke rises, perhaps three houses.

General Meaning is omitted. (on page 109) <112>

Slurp Slurp (훌훌)

1. 惰婦夜摘葉 / Lazy wife picks leaves at night,
纔成粥一鍾 / Barely makes one bowl of porridge.

2. 廚間暗食聲 / Sound of secret eating in the kitchen,
山鳥善形容 / Well described by a mountain bird ['s call].

General Meaning—A lazy wife goes out at night, picks a few vegetable leaves, and barely makes a single cup (鍾杯) of porridge. The sound of her secretly eating it in the kitchen, *hool-hool-hool* (훌훌훌), aptly mimics the sound of a mountain bird flying away, *hool-hool* (훌훌).<109>
<110-112, 109>

**Summary**

This article by Yi Ŭng-su introduces selected poems by the renowned wandering poet Kim Sakkat (Kim Pyŏng-yŏn). Yi expresses his ongoing effort, despite personal difficulties, to compile a collection of Kim Sakkat's works, an endeavor spanning several years. He presents several poems, including verses about travels to Hamhŭng and Anbyŏn, humorous or satirical pieces about lodging requests, wordplay involving a kisaeng's name, critiques of lazy and sleepy wives, and observations of village life. Yi provides his own interpretations (大意, Taeŭi) for each poem and requests reader assistance in his collecting project, giving his address. The article reflects continued interest in traditional Korean literary figures during the colonial period. For historians, it offers insight into the reception and interpretation of Kim Sakkat's poetry in the 1930s, the challenges faced by independent scholars like Yi Ŭng-su, the specific poems known or attributed to Kim Sakkat at the time, and the cultural content disseminated through popular magazines like *Samch'ŏlli*.

登咸興九天閣

1. 人登樓閣臨九天
馬渡長橋踏萬歲
2. 山疑野狹遠遠立
水畏舟行淺淺流

3. 山意龍盤虎踞形
樓閣鸞飛鳳翼勢

此 1句 未知

大意―人이 樓閣에 올으니 이 咸興城에 유명한 九天閣이오, 馬가 長橋를 건느니 이 萬歲橋이라. 산은 평야가 狹窄하여질가 의심하야 멀리 遠方에 퇴각하여 섯고, 물은 舟行을 두려워 하야 얏게얏게 흘러간다.(城川江의 수심이 엿흔 것은 고래로 유명하다)
山意와 山名은 盤龍山이라 하나 盤龍의 형국 갓지는 안코 虎踞의 형상이오, 樓閣은 鸞鳥가 나는 것 갓다 하나 실은 鳳翼을 펼친 상이다.(이하 1구를 독자 중에 아시는 이가 잇거든 알려주실 수 업슬가요.)

安邊瓢然亭

1. 一城踏罷有高樓
覓酒題詩問幾流

2. 古木多情黃鳥至
大江無恙白鷗飛

3. 英雄過去風煙盡
客子登臨歲月悠

4. 宿債關東猶來了
欲隨征雁下長洲



1. 飄然亭子出長堤
鶴去樓空鳥獨啼

2. 十里煙霞橋上下
一天風月水東西<110>

3. 神仙蹤跡雲過幽
遠客襟懷歲暮會

4. 羽化門前無問處
蓬萊消息夢中迷

大意―安邊의 一城을 踏罷한 후에 한 高樓가 잇스니 이것이 蓬萊仙人이 학을 타고 표연이 등천하엿다는 흔적을 기념키 위하야 세운 飄然亭이다. 樓上에 술을 구하야 시를 題하고 안변의 江數가 멧친가 뭇는다. 고목이 다정하야 黃鳥가 일으러 쉬고 大江인 南大川이 無恙하야 白鷗가 난다. 영웅은 과거하야 風煙이 盡하엿고 客子가 登臨하고 등림하는 사이에 세월은 유구하다. 余는 이제 관동의 金剛山을 충분이 구경치 못하고 온 전일의 宿債가 잇서서 이제로붓터 征雁을 따라 長洲로 내려가려 하노라.



飄然亭子가 長堤의 一隅에 돌출하여 잇는대 학은 선인을 태우고 날어간 뒤 樓는 비여 雜鳥호을로 울고 잇다. 십리 煙霞에 상하에 다리가 잇고 일천풍월 사이에 물은 東亞에 흘으도다. 신선 종적이 雲過한 후에 幽遠하고 歲暮에 遠客의 襟懷가 묘연하다. 蓬萊仙人의 羽化門前에 물을 곳이 업스니 그이의 소식은 夢中에 아득할 뿐이로다.

失題(據 金在喆씨)

1. 許多韻字何呼覓
彼覓有難況此覓

2. 一夜宿寢懸於覓
山村訓長但知覓

大意―金笠이 모처에 가서 一夜의 宿寢을 구하엿든 바 주인이 풍월을 지으면 소청을 容한다 하야 주인의 부르는 韻字(覓)에 의하야 부른 절구이다.
허다한 운자가 잇거든 어이 覓자를 불으는고. 그가 難이 잇기를 求(覓자의 字意) 하는대 況此 이 覓자란 기발한 운에 일으러 서리요. 一夜의 宿寢이 이 覓자 한 자에 달려 잇스니 이 산촌훈장 오즉 覓자만 아는 모양이다.

可憐妓詩

1. 可憐行色可憐身
可憐門前訪可憐

2. 可憐此意傳可憐
可憐能知可憐心

大意―『可憐』이라하는 기생에게 정을 訴하는 詣다.
起句의 可憐 둘은 可憐이란 뜻 그대로이오, 承句의 두 可憐은 妓名의 可憐이다. 轉句의 첫 可憐은 『가련할사』란 부사요, 둘재 可憐은 妓名, 結句의 첫 可憐은 妓名이오, 둘재 可憐은 可憐한 마음이란 可憐의 본래의 意다.
가련한 행색의 가련한 몸이 『可憐』의 문전에 가서 『可憐』을 차젓다. 가련할사 『可憐』에게 이 뜻을 전하면 필연코 『可憐』은 나의 이 가련한 마음을 알어 줄 것이다.

失題

1. 邑號開城何閉門
山名松獄豈無薪

2. 黃昏逐客非人事
禮義東方子獨秦

大意―역시 開城에 가서 某家에 一夜를 청하매 주인이 나무가 업서 불을 못 때엿스니, 무어니 하는 구실로 문밧게 내여 쫏고 문을 다더 걸음을 痛怨한 구다.
邑號는 開城인대 이 몹쓸 놈아, 문을 웨다더거는냐.
山名이 松獄山이니 松木이 울울하엿슬 터인대 나무가 업다 함이 웬말이냐, 황혼에 逐客함은 人事가 안이니 東方禮義之國이라 일컷는 朝鮮에서 너 홀로 폭군 秦始皇이 분명하다.

懶婦

1. 無病無憂洗浴稀
十年猶着嫁時衣

2. 乳連褓兒謀午睡
收拾裙風愛簷暉

3. 動身便碎廚中器
搔首愁看壁上機

4. 忽聞隣家神祀慰
柴門半掩走如飛<111>

大意―無病無憂한 懶婦! 목욕까지 안하야 신체가 더러운데 의복은 10년을 1일 갓치 嫁時의 의복을 입을 뿐이오. 新製의 의복을 입는 일이 업다. 의복을 하기 실혀 하는 까닭이다. 褓兒에게 젓을 물니고 매양 午睡를 도모하고 手掌에 裙裳의 『이』를 잡어들고 일광이 휘황한 簷下로 닥어 안는 것이다. 걸신몸을 움즉이자 부억의 기구를 부시고 布帛은 짜지 안코 壁上에 베틀(機을 걸어 놋고 수심스러이 머리만 썩썩 글는다. 그리다가도 홀연이 隣家에서 祀神際 지내는 눈치가 잇스면 柴門을 半掩하고 나는 듯이 달어가는 것이다.

多睡婦

1. 西隣愚婦睡方濃
不識蠶工況也農

2. 機閑尺布三朝識
杵倦升粮半日舂

3. 弟衣秋盡猶稱搗
姑襪冬過每語縫

4. 蓬髮拓面形如鬼
偕老家中却恨逢

大意―인가의 愚婦가 방금 午睡가 깁헛다. 이 愚婦는 蠶工도 농사도 몰라 1尺의 布를 3朝를 걸려 짜고 1升의 粮을 반일을 걸려서 찌어 機는 항상 한가하고 杵는 항상 徒遊한다. 弟衣를 秋盡하도록 짓지 안으며 『방치질을 해야겟는데, 방치질을 해야겟는데』하며 입으로만 까불고 姑의 『버선』은 겨울이 다가도록 만들지 안으며 항상 『바느질을 해야겟는데, 바느질을 해야겟는데』하고 떠든다.
蓬髮拓面에 形姿는 귀신 갓흔데 백년을 해로하여야 할 일가족이 이 愚婦를 맛난 것을 한탄하여 마지안는다.

戱贈妻妾

1. 不熱不寒二月天
一妻一妾最堪憐

2. 鴛鴦枕上三頭並
翡翠衾中六臂連

3. 開口笑時渾似品
翻身臥處變成川

4. 東邊未了西邊事
更向東邊打玉拳

大意―과부가 들떠난다는 不熱不寒한 初春의 2월 天은 一家에 共住하는 一妻一妾에게 제일 가련한 시기이나 부부 2인이 자야할 원앙침상에 첩까지 끼우니 3頭가 並하고 翡翠衾 중에는 6臂(다리가 여섯)가 連하게 된다. 3인이 開口笑時에는 渾然이 『品』자를 일우고 (品자는 『입』이 셋임으로) 翻身하야 누을 때에는 3인의 형상이 『川』자를 맨든다. 남자는 東邊事를 未了한데 또 西邊事를 착수하게 되고 다시 東邊에 돌아누으며 玉手를 슬적 처준다.

海村卽事

1. 翠靄西分赤日東
四隣稠密機椽同

2. 山光半入漁人船
海利全滿賈客銅

3. 靜處希音風過萩
霽時淸景月來桐

4. 箇中亦有觀瀾室
多少兒童講原崇

大意―아츰에는 翠靄가 西分한데 赤日이 東켠에 솟아을으는 어촌에 인가가 조밀하다. 그러나 다 각각 異姓이요, 同姓의 大族은 업는 듯 하다. 山影이 어선에 절반 빗치여 들고 海利는 다 상인의 囊中에 들어간다. 靜處는 소리가 업는대 바람이 추엽을 스처가고 霽時에 명월이 오동나무에 내려 빗치이는 청경이 또한 좃타. 그중에도 또한 찬란한 서당방이 잇서 다소의 아동이 講을 하고 잇다.
原崇은 뜻을 잘 알 수 업다. 崇은 宋과 상통하는대 原의 意를 解할 수 업다.

遊山

1. 蹇馬看山好
持鞭故不加

2. 岩邊纔一路
姻處或三家

大意는 略한다.(제109頁에)<112>

훌훌

1. 惰婦夜摘葉
纔成粥一鍾

2. 廚間暗食聲
山鳥善形容

大意―惰婦가 밤에 나가 菜葉을 조금 뜻어다 겨우 粥한 鍾杯를 맨들어서 그것을 부억에서 가만이 먹는 소래가 훌훌훌 하는게 山鳥가 훌훌하고 날어가는 소래를 흡사히 형용하엿다.<109>
