Samch'ŏlli "Wall Newspaper"

Health Movement Society (保健運動社) Founded

Authorities from the medical world (刀胄界), including Mr. Yang Pong-gŭn (Director of Kyōwa Hospital), Yi In-gyu (Imperial University), Yi Sŏn-gŭn (Imperial University), Yu Paek-kyu (Medical College), and about 10 others, have become central figures in aiming to start a major health movement in Korea (朝鮮). The scope and items of their work are as follows:
1. Monthly publication of the organ "Health Movement" (「보건운동」).
2. Propagation and promotion of the health movement.
3. Frequent holding of mobile clinics and lecture meetings.
4. Investigation and research into Korea's local and endemic diseases.
It is reported that they have set up a temporary office at 42 Sup'yo-dong, Kyŏngsŏng, and will soon publish the inaugural issue of the organ "Health Movement."

Total Number of Compatriots Suffering Disaster and Killed in Manchuria

Due to the recent Sino-Japanese conflict (日中戰亂), the precise number of compatriots who suffered disaster in that remote land has not yet emerged, but it reaches tens of thousands. The total number killed by Chinese defeated soldiers (中國 패잔병에게 X殺된) is calculated, based only on the figures that have emerged so far, as several hundred - 700 plus.

Urgent Notice (急告)

Regarding the article on the theory of legal and illegal movements (합법운동과 비합법운동론), as this is of a significant nature, we intended to discuss it fully, but things did not turn out that way. More than two-thirds of the manuscripts from the aforementioned three gentlemen (以上 3氏) had to be cut, and the following two articles could not be published at all. We ask for the deep understanding (深諒) of the authors and the members of society.
1. To Open My Heart (予의 심경을 타개하야) (67 manuscript pages)
Yi Chŏng-sŏp (李晶燮)
2. An Overview of Taiwan's (臺灣) Legal Movement (원고 20매)
Kim Tong-hwan (金東煥)

**Summary**

This news section reports on three items: the establishment of the Health Movement Society (Pogon Undongsa) in Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul) by prominent medical figures, aiming to improve public health through publications, clinics, and research; the significant number of Korean casualties (tens of thousands displaced, over 700 killed) in Manchuria following the recent "Sino-Japanese conflict"; and an editorial notice from Samch'ŏlli explaining that articles discussing the sensitive topic of "legal vs. illegal movements" were heavily cut or entirely omitted due to circumstances, including pieces by Yi Chŏng-sŏp and Kim Tong-hwan (whose article focused on Taiwan's legal movement). This piece offers historians insights into social initiatives like public health movements in colonial Korea, the devastating impact of regional conflicts (like the Manchurian Incident aftermath) on the Korean diaspora, and the constraints of censorship forcing publications to self-censor or remove politically sensitive content related to nationalist strategies. The specific mention of cutting an article about Taiwan's legal movement is particularly interesting regarding comparative colonial experiences and strategies.
