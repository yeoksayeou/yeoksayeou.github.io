Yi Kwangsu's Tuition Fees

Although it is widely known that Mr. Kim Sŏngsu paid most of Mr. Yi Kwangsu's tuition fees when Yi was studying at Waseda University in Tokyo, investigations reveal that it was not paid from Mr. Kim Sŏngsu's private funds. Instead, Chungang School designated him as a scholarship student and sent 20 wŏn each month. Furthermore, it is said that Mr. Kim did not send the money directly, but rather it was remitted through Mr. An Chaehong, who was the Dean (學監) of Chungang School at the time, and the total amount was only about 200 wŏn.

The Stone-Throwing of P'yŏngyang People

It is a famous fact that people from P'yŏngyang are good at throwing stones. During the recent "P'yŏngyang Incident," stone-throwing served as a major weapon when carrying out acts against Chinese people.
However, an even more famous incident occurred some time ago in Hawaii (布哇) where a major clash broke out among Koreans. It was due to detestable factional strife.
At that time, a group (隊) of people from P'yŏngyang attacked the village of a certain faction. Their only weapons were thrown stones.
Whizz! When a stone hit, a person would collapse.
It was more effective than bullets (銃丸). Everyone who saw the accuracy of their throws and the absolute destructive power was astonished.
Foreigners reportedly shut their doors tightly and watched the stone fight (石戰). After the fight ended (戰畢), they went out to the scene, picked up the stones, put them to their ears, and listened to see if they made noise. It seems they did so wondering if perhaps some newly invented Eastern weapon, like a sound-emitting bullet, had appeared.<137>

**Summary**

This "Wall Newspaper" section presents two short anecdotes. The first clarifies a rumor about Yi Kwangsu's tuition at Waseda University, stating it was funded by Chungang School via An Chaehong, not directly from Kim Sŏngsu's personal wealth, and the amount was smaller than believed. The second piece highlights the renowned stone-throwing skill of people from P'yŏngyang, referencing its use during anti-Chinese violence in the "P'yŏngyang Incident" and recounting a fierce factional battle among Koreans in Hawaii where P'yŏngyang natives' stone-throwing prowess reportedly amazed foreign observers. For historians, the article offers insight into contemporary rumor correction, perceptions and stereotypes of regional groups (P'yŏngyang), the violent aftermath of the Wanpaoshan incident extending to P'yŏngyang, and intra-Korean conflict within the diaspora (Hawaii), reflecting social dynamics and tensions of the colonial period.

平壤 사람의 돌팔매

平壤 사람이 돌팔매 잘 치는 것은 유명한 사실이다. 이번 「平壤事件」으로 중국인에게 소행을 할 때에도 돌팔매가 큰 무기노릇을 하엿다.
그런데 더욱 유명한 사실은 얼마 전에 布哇에서 조선사람 사이에 대충돌이 생기엇다. 可憎할 당파싸홈 때문이엇다.
그때 平壤사람이 한 隊가 되어 某某의 부락을 습격하엿다. 무기는 오직 돌팔매 뿐이엇다.
쌩! 하고 가서 마즈면 사람이 꺽구러진다.
銃丸 이상이엇다. 그 사격의 정확, 부상력의 절대 보는 사람이 모다 놀낫다.
외국사람들은 문을 굿게 닷고 그 石戰을 구경하다가 戰畢 후에 현장에 나가서 그 돌맹이를 주어다가 귀에 대이고 소리 나는가 들엇다고 한다. 아마 최신발명된 무슨 동방무기로 소리나는 탄환이나 생기엇든가고 그리함인 듯.<137>
