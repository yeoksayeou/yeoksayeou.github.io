Samch'ŏlli Company Sponsored Youth Student Oratorical Contest via Magazine, Samch'ŏlli Company's Humble Sincerity: Scholarship Aid for Talented Students

Starting from the upcoming February issue, our company will hold a Youth Student Oratorical Contest via the magazine, aiming to introduce to the world the truly pure and blood-boiling, spirited fiery speeches of the young students of the Peninsula. Esteemed students! The time has truly come for us to finally open wide our long-stifled minds. Please participate in large numbers to awaken the ears of our sleeping compatriots, please help them open their eyes! The people of the Peninsula greatly anticipate your future and wish to hear what is in your hearts.

First Topic: Does Chosŏn Seek Strategists or the Wealthy?

□Note= 1. Please send in manuscripts written for the speech, exactly as if you were delivering it verbally on the speaker's platform.
2. Manuscripts will be accepted until January 8th, and submissions are limited to students, so please be sure to write your school name on the manuscript.
3. A modest token of appreciation will be presented to those selected. (However, non-subscribers to this magazine are also welcome)

A talented individual (秀才) is a treasure to their people and their society. We sometimes strike the desk while reading history books, thinking how such great things could have been achieved if that one person had not existed. Now, our society's call for talented individuals is ever more urgent. Therefore, despite our humble capabilities, our company intends to provide at least a small amount of scholarship aid to unfortunate students who possess talent but lack money, decaying along with the grass and trees (與草木同腐). We are deeply saddened that, as our company inherently does not have much money, it will likely amount to only a pittance (鳥足之血).

□□
And the standard by which we judge talent will place emphasis on the person's character rather than the superiority or inferiority of their academic record. Didn't someone like Napoleon (柰巴倫) even fail during his time at military academy? In essence, if someone is magnanimous, passionate, or possesses an unconventional and profound character, we will not hesitate (躊䠱치안켓슴니다) to open our hearts and gladly embrace them.
□□□
□Recommendations will be entirely entrusted to the principals of middle schools throughout the Peninsula.
□We intend to implement this starting from the new school term this coming April.
□The number of scholarship students, the amount of money, and other regulations will be announced later.<63>

**Summary**

This article announces two initiatives by the Korean magazine *Samch'ŏlli* in 1932: a monthly oratorical contest held "on the pages" of the magazine for students to voice their opinions (starting with the topic "Does Chosŏn Seek Strategists or the Wealthy?"), and a scholarship fund to support talented but financially struggling students. The magazine emphasizes character and passion over mere academic grades for the scholarship, citing Napoleon as an example. Recommendations for the scholarship will come from middle school principals across the Korean Peninsula. This article is interesting to historians as it shows a private Korean entity (a magazine) actively trying to foster intellectual discourse and support education among young Koreans during the Japanese colonial period. The emphasis on oratory, the specific contest topic regarding national needs (strategists vs. wealth), and the criteria for scholarships (character over grades, citing Napoleon) reflect contemporary nationalist sentiments and efforts towards cultural and intellectual development under restrictive circumstances.
