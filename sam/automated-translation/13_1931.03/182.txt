Remembering My Older Sister
						Pak P'aryang

Because of pure heart, I remember and weep, for the one who dreamed of life, dreamed of death.

◇

My sister who lamented, "My heart is eternally autumn," where are you now?

◇

Though I call and call, there is still no voice, the autumn dusk of the deserted cemetery.

◇

The autumn sky is lonely, on the way home, having left the master of my memories in the field.

◇

It was a dream of a short summer night, your coming to this world and leaving it.

◇

Memories are endless when recalled, I only pray that you may be at peace. <41>

**Summary**

This Japanese poem by the Korean poet Pak P'aryang expresses deep sorrow and longing while reminiscing about his deceased older sister. The poet reflects on her pure heart, her past laments, and the finality of her absence, symbolized by the lonely autumn setting of a cemetery. He views her life as fleeting, like a summer night's dream, and concludes by praying for her peaceful rest. From a historical perspective, the article is significant as it showcases a Korean author publishing poetry in Japanese during the colonial period. This reflects the linguistic landscape and cultural pressures of the time, where using Japanese was common, sometimes necessary, in public and literary spheres.
