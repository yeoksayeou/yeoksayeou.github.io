江南제비
						파인

It's March, the third day of the third lunar month,
Gangnam swallows are building their nests.
My dear brother who went away like the nest-building swallows,
Even after waiting ten days, there's no news.

The rivers and mountains are wide and vast, and compatriots are everywhere,
Ah, ha, ha, I miss the nest-building (동주비),
I shed tears looking at the Gangnam swallows.
Oh, my brother in Siberia (서백리아), have you not forgotten?
—P’ain— <1>

**Summary**

This short poem, "Gangnam Swallow," by P'ain (Kim Tong-hwan), expresses the sorrow and longing of a speaker whose brother (or lover, "oppa") is absent. Contrasting the return of swallows building nests in spring with the lack of news from her brother in Siberia, the poem conveys a sense of personal loss and anxiety amidst the vastness of the land and the presence of many compatriots. The poem evokes themes of separation, waiting, and yearning, common experiences during the Japanese colonial period. Historians might find the specific mention of Siberia significant, reflecting Korean migration, exile, or labor mobilization patterns during that era. The poem subtly intertwines personal grief with a broader sense of national displacement or separation ("compatriots are everywhere," yet the loved one is far away and unreachable).

江南제비
						파인
삼월이라 삼진날
江南제비 둥주리 친다.
둥주리 치려 가시든 옵바
열에일해 기둘너도 소식업네

江山은 넓고 크고 동포만 흔네
아, 하, 하, 동주비 그립어
강남제비에 눈물 짓네
서백리아의 옵바야, 닛지나 안으섯나
