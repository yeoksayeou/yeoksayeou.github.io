My Conical Hat (吟笠)

My merely conical hat is like an empty boat.
Once worn, it's been my whole life for 40 years.<29>
The old man herding cattle, the man of the sea too,
Only after wearing this does their true character show!

When drunk, I take it off and hang it on a flowering tree;
When merry, I carry it up to the Moon-Viewing Pavilion (翫月樓).
The attire of worldly folk is just outward show;
When it rains all over the river, what use is that!

Original Poem (原詩)
1  My hat is like an empty boat
Once worn, forty autumns of a lifetime<29>
2  The herdsman's light gear follows the field calf
The fisherman's true self accompanies the sand gulls

3  When drunk, I come, take it off, hang it, look at the flowering tree
When spirits rise, I carry it, ascend, view the moon pavilion
4  Worldly folk's clothes and caps are all outward adornment
With wind and rain filling the river, can one be without sorrow?

Songdo (松都)

Tying my horse at the empty mound, I sigh;
Is this the site of a five-hundred-year royal dynasty?
Crows cry in the ruined city where evening mist rises;
Wild geese fly over the desolate terrace where fallen leaves drift.

The old stone dog and worn bronze pedestal (銅坮) say nothing;
Whom can I ask about the ancient capital's olden days?
Looking back, the place that especially rends the heart is
Sŏnjukkyo Bridge (善竹橋), where the river of blood chokes back tears.<30>
<29-30>

**Summary**

This article presents two poems attributed to the famous wandering poet Kim Sakkat (Kim Rip), as transcribed or rendered into contemporary Korean (of 1931) by Yi Ŭngsu. The first poem reflects on the poet's iconic conical hat (삿갓), portraying it as a symbol of his simple, unadorned life, contrasting it with the superficiality of worldly attire. The second poem is an elegy for Songdo (Kaesŏng), the former capital of the Koryŏ dynasty, lamenting its ruined state and recalling the tragic history associated with Sŏnjukkyo Bridge. From a historical perspective, the article is interesting for its use of mixed Hanja and Hangul, older Korean spellings (e.g., 꼿나무, 녯일, 류달리, 하면), and its choice of subject matter. Presenting poems reflecting on Korea's past, particularly the fall of a dynasty, during the Japanese colonial period could subtly evoke feelings of loss and nostalgia for a sovereign past among Korean readers.

						李應洙
吟笠
것뿐한 나의 삿갓 빈 배와 갓네
한번 쓰니 일평생 40년일네
소먹이는 늙은이 바다ㅅ사람도
이것을 쓴 다음에 본색이 나지!

하면 꼿나무에 벗어다 걸고
흥질 때 翫月樓를 차자 올으네
속인의 의관이란 外飾뿐인게
비만 오면 그것이 무엇에 쓴담!

原詩
一  **我笠等虛舟
一着平生四十秋＜29＞
二  牧叟輕裝隨野犢
漁翁本色伴沙鷗

三  醉來脫掛看花樹
興到携登翫月樓
四  俗子衣冠皆外飾
滿江風雨可無愁

松都
空邱에 말을 매고 탄식하노니
이것이 半千年의 王業터라나
暮煙이는 廢城에 가마귀 울어
落葉지는 荒坮엔 기럭이 나네

늙은 石狗 헌 銅坮 말이 업으니
古都의 녯일을 뉘게 물을고
도라보아 류달리 가슴압흔곳
善竹橋 피강물이 목매여 운다.＜30＞
