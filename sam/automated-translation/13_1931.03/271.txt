○Gratitude and Apology
						Kim Tong-hwan

One, For the expansion of freedom of speech (言論), assembly (集會), and association (結社), this company (本社) did its utmost with humble efforts (微力) this month, but among the various gentlemen (諸氏) who wrote, only the articles of Mr. An Chae-hong and Mr. Yi Chu-yŏn could be published (and even those not completely). However, in the upcoming April issue, we will truly bring forth the most urgent and important issues (最緊最重한 問題) of our masses, gather esteemed opinions (高見) widely, and exert our full effort (全力) to create a forum (會議場) for the entire Korean populace (全朝鮮民衆).

Two, The time is spring! Even in spring, it is March, a time when our emotions boil to their peak (最高潮). Now! Let us energetically rise up (躍起합시다) from all negligence (怠慢). However, the matter for which we must apologize above all is that the March issue could only be put on sale today, the 7th. This delay, limited only to this month, was not due to editing (編輯) or printing (印刷), but occurred due to some other unspeakable special circumstances ( 엇든 말못할 專情). However, the April issue will assuredly (期於코) be put on sale around March 25th. Friends of the world (天下의 벗이어)! "If you were to abandon Samch'ŏlli, who would become our friend?" Please consider it as your own (내것가티아시고) and I hope for much guidance (指導) and readership (愛讀). <70>

**Summary**

This editor's postscript by Kim Tong-hwan expresses gratitude to contributors and readers while primarily apologizing for the significant delay in publishing the March 1931 issue of Samch'ŏlli magazine, attributing it to unspecified "unspeakable special circumstances" rather than editorial or printing problems. He notes the difficulty in publishing articles advocating for freedoms of speech, assembly, and association, mentioning that contributions by An Chae-hong and Yi Chu-yŏn were only partially included. He promises a timely April issue focused on critical public issues and appeals for continued reader support, framing the magazine as a vital forum for Koreans. From a historical perspective, the article clearly reflects the censorship and constraints faced by Korean publications under Japanese colonial rule, hinting at external pressures forcing delays and content restrictions. The specific mention of censored nationalist figures like An Chae-hong and Yi Chu-yŏn, alongside the magazine's aspiration to be a public forum despite these challenges, highlights the precarious environment for nationalist discourse and the strategies employed by publishers to navigate it.
