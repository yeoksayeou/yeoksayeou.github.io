Lighting up a Cigarette

Last spring, during the great flood disaster (大水災), Chosŏn (朝鮮), Tong-A (東亞), and Chungoe (中外) newspapers collected over 20,000 won in donations (義捐金). The fact that there has been absolutely no announcement about when, to whom, and how that money was distributed is decidedly unpleasant.

While the fields are filled with bird carcasses (鳥屍) and the alleys (巷閭) are filled with the living dead (生屍) of humans, aren't the newspaper companies, which profess to always put the people's joy last and their worries first (民後樂, 先其憂), going to undertake relief work? The newspaper presidents' homes may have plenty of rice cakes and rice - but when will the time come for the poor to rescue the rich?

The era of monitoring men's chastity is coming! But do women possess the talent to make chastity belts for men?

There's a newspaper soliciting "Secrets to Gaining Wealth" (致富秘訣). This sounds like a blind man's tale of virtue (經德談). Can they not see this world where 10-jeon pawnings (典當) are rapidly increasing? The small-minded group (群小) who feel secure just receiving their salaries on time greatly mislead the world.

The daily expense for the five athletes who went from Kongju (公州) to Tokyo (東京) is 500 won, a burden of 10 won per citizen. However, to avoid losing Kongju (公州), <28> it must be called a small burden.

At the Sin'ganhoe (新幹會) headquarters' anniversary ceremony, the number of people in the hall was sparse. Have they found their spirit of former days again?

The principal and the teachers all have their necks hanging within a single mountain monk's (山僧) 108 prayer beads (念珠). As an example of the commercialization of education, this is an excessively sad affair – a case from a certain high common school (某高普) in the city. <29>

**Summary**

This short essay offers sharp social commentary on various issues in 1931 Korea. The author criticizes the lack of transparency from major newspapers regarding flood relief funds, contrasts the suffering of the poor with the apparent indifference of the wealthy (including newspaper owners), mocks the idea of soliciting "get rich quick" schemes amidst poverty, comments cynically on gender roles, notes the financial burden of supporting athletes, observes the dwindling attendance at a Sin'ganhoe event, and laments the commercialization and perceived external control over education, citing a specific school incident. For historians, this piece offers a valuable glimpse into colonial-era social critique, revealing public dissatisfaction with media accountability, awareness of economic hardship, evolving views on gender, nationalist sentiment (implied in the Kongju sports reference and Sin'ganhoe mention), and concerns about the integrity of the education system under external pressures. The pointed, almost sarcastic tone reflects a critical perspective on the societal state during that period.
