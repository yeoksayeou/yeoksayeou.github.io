Thinking of my mother who thinks of me, alone and lonely until the sun sets.

□

Today too is a melancholy spring day; my heart is forever autumn.

□

Thinking I must not think, yet I think again—that person, how are they now?

□

To be able to compose poems is still fortunate; though I try to compose, I cannot.

□

I must not think, I must not think; I must never think of him.

□

The storm has passed, the storm in my heart; after a long time, I gaze upon the green leaves.

□

Oh, how foolish I was! To discard is indeed to gain.

□

Reading pastoral literature and Bashō; how nostalgic these characters are!

□

Like a dream were the past painful years; I shall live anew from this day on.<39>

**Summary**

This posthumous poem by Pak Chŏngjin expresses themes of loneliness, longing for a loved one ("かの君," "彼") and mother, inner turmoil likened to a storm, and eventual resolution towards a new life. The speaker finds solace in nature ("靑葉") and literature ("田園文學," "芭蕉"), reflecting on past suffering ("苦しき幾年") and foolishness before embracing the idea that letting go ("捨てる") leads to gain ("得るもの"). For historians, the poem is interesting as it's written in Japanese by a Korean author during the colonial period, reflecting the linguistic landscape and perhaps personal assimilation or education circumstances. The intensely personal and melancholic, yet ultimately hopeful, tone provides a glimpse into individual experiences under potentially difficult historical conditions, marked as a posthumous work suggesting a life potentially cut short.
