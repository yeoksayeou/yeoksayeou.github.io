兒亡後有感
						玄相允

One evening, wind and frost suddenly arose, startling,
All feelings and sights seem unreal.
Still, the father's grief persists morning and evening,
Unbearable, the child's cries arise in the middle of the night.

Heartbroken by the faint image below the courtyard,
Guts twisted, not hearing the voice before the hall.
The old pavilion is empty and desolate, no one lives there,
Only the old moon remains, entering the window brightly.

Note: The deceased child left behind one boy and one girl child, hence the mention.

Again

Wanting to forget, yet ultimately unable to forget,
As days pass, the pain grows even longer.
Nothing can soothe my mind,
In the middle of the night, I weep under the cold frost. <58>

**Summary**

This article consists of two short poems in Hanja by Hyŏn Sangyun expressing his profound grief following the death of his child. The first poem describes the shock, the haunting memories of the child's presence, the persistent sorrow, and the desolate atmosphere. The second poem reiterates the inescapable nature of his pain, which deepens with time, leaving him inconsolable. For historians, the article offers a poignant glimpse into the personal suffering of a prominent Korean intellectual during the colonial period, expressed through the traditional medium of Hanja poetry. It highlights how personal tragedy was articulated and shared within the literary landscape of the time.

兒亡後有感
						玄相允
一夕風霜忽起驚 心傷庭下依稀貌
感觀總是不眞情 膓裂堂前未聽聲
尙忽父哀朝暮息 舊樓空寂人無住
難堪兒呼夜中生 舊月獨存入窓明
註亡兒遺有一男一女之孩兒故及之
又
欲忘卒不忘 無物安余意
日去痛尤長 中宵泣凁霜＜58＞
