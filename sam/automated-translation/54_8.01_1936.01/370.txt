競技詞
						爲堂 鄭寅普

One lift of an arm, one lift of a leg, lowering and raising, retreating and advancing,
The sun seems new, even the tree leaves shine.
Though it was a gathering last year too, it feels like the first time.

Let the beating drum burst, we won't leave unless we win.
With a face full of mischief, the cheering captain has emerged.
Though seemingly behind, he springs like a tiger, they say it’s first place!

<250>

The fine muscles (筯肉) of arms and legs show their strength even at rest.
That turning lion, is it fearsome only when angered?
When urged on by companions, it seems filled with affection (情).

The ancient water games (水戱) of Koguryŏ are heard throughout the world.
When hitting the ball (毬) from horseback, Songak Mountain trembled and shook.
Do not long for the deeds of a thousand years, we are here now.

Injured and hopping about, he instantly jumps up again.
Though there may be no medicine, I will conquer with my spirit.
Unable even to approach the pain, who could watch this?

<251>

Accustomed to the cannon's roar, even the baby on a back is not startled.
Those sitting and watching, pushed by the fervor, are warriors too.
Elder brothers, uncles, how is the spectacle (景幾)?

As the band swells with excitement, will they just play according to the score?
The wind that blows from time to time makes even the pine forest resound.
Applause erupts like thunder, let us greet the victors.

Fluttering, fluttering flags, as if filled and blown by courage.
The spear piercing like an arrow, why should a long distance exist?
There is no one who will lose, what harm in laughing together (맛웃는)?
- End - <252>

**Summary**

This poem by Chŏng Inbo vividly captures the energy and spirit of an athletic competition in 1936 Korea. It describes the physical movements of athletes, the excitement of the crowd and cheerleaders, the sounds of drums and music, and the determination of competitors overcoming injury. The poem elevates the sporting event by linking it to historical Korean prowess, referencing Koguryŏ's water games and equestrian skills near Songak Mountain, invoking a sense of national pride and continuity. For historians, the poem is interesting as it reflects a burgeoning interest in modern sports during the colonial period, while simultaneously using historical allusions (Koguryŏ, Songaksan associated with Koryŏ) perhaps as a subtle expression of Korean identity and resilience under Japanese rule, framing contemporary activities within a proud national lineage. The mention of being accustomed to "cannon's roar" might also subtly hint at the militarized backdrop of the era.

						爲堂 鄭寅普


팔 한 번 다리 한 번 들고 노코 미(退)고 내고,
太陽이 새로운 듯 나무입도 비치로다.
昨年도 모듬이엇만 첨갓도 소이다.



치는 북 터지거라 안니기곤 안가리라.
익살로 채운 얼굴 응원대장 나스셋네
뒤진 듯 범가치 나니 一着이라 하더라

<250>

팔다리 조흔 筯肉 쉬일제도 勇을 보네
몸트(轉)는 저 사자야 성내서만 무서울가
동무네 부촉여들제 情듯(滴)는 듯 하여라.



高句麗 녯 水戱는 들레니라 온 天下에
말채서 바올(毬)칠제 松岳山이 움줄움줄
千年事 그리워마소 우리 여긔 잇소라



다치어 껑긔더니 금적하자 벌서뛰네
藥이라 업스런만 내 얼로써 이긔리라
압품도 못 대여드니 뉘라거라 보리오

<251>

砲響에 귀가 익어 업힌 애도 안 놀라고
안저서 보시는 이 熱에 밀려 勇士로다
성님네 아즈먼네들 景幾 엇더하닛고



樂隊가 興에 뜨니 譜만 거겨 치올것가
때때로 부는 바람 松林조차 우주린다
拍掌이 우레로 나니 勝者마중 하옵세



펄펄펄 나는 旗빨 勇氣가득 부러챈 듯
살가치 꼿치는 槍 먼 距離가 웨 잇스리
지시리 한 분 업서라 맛웃는(笑)들 엇더리
