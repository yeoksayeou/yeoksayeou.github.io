Passing Soryŏngwŏn, Tomb of King Sukchong's Consort, and the Old Battlefield of Pyŏkchekwan (Continued)
						Ch'oe Pong-ch'ik

Receiving only the rays of light emitted by the warm autumn sun, we bought 10 nyang worth of the chestnut-dusted injeolmi rice cakes that are a specialty here. Like children, we walked along the main road, satisfying the hunger we felt in our somewhat empty stomachs with the rice cakes before charging through the old battlefield in one go like Tachibana Muneshige. Passing through the streets of Pyŏkche-ri, we looked west towards the peak of Hyeŭmnyŏng Pass near Horanggul (Tiger's Den). To the right, in Utkol (Sanggok, Upper Valley), we were surprised to see an enormous pile of firewood (長斫) stacked roadside, logged so terribly that it reached mid-sky like a great mountain. When I asked a laborer what firewood this was, he replied, "It belongs to a Japanese mainlander (日本內地人) who leased the forest around Tŏkp'aryŏng Pass (commonly called Toepak Pass) from a certain official (某當者) in Ŭijŏngbu. He contracted last year and felled the trees." These astonishing piles of firewood stacked before and after the pass were said to be enough fuel for the 400,000 citizens of Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul) for one month. Crossing Toepak Pass, which has a somewhat steep slope at an altitude of 270 meters (海拔 270米), we entered the boundary of Yangju-gun County. Intoxicated <142> by the busy autumn scenery of the farming village harvesting crops in the fields (田畓) shining gold under the autumn sun, we continued our journey for about 10 more ri from the pass, sometimes through sorghum fields, sometimes through rice paddies, sometimes stepping across stone bridges over small streams (細川). We arrived at Paeksŏng-myŏn, Yŏngjang-ni, where fir trees, tall stately pines (落落長松), and birch trees spread out deeply. Here, strangely reflecting the autumn colors under a 300-meter high peak, was Soryŏngwŏn (昭寧園).

Of course, we did not forget that Sugirwŏn (綏吉園), the tomb of King Yŏngjo's consort, Lady Yi (嬪李氏), is also located to the right of this entrance.
Through the garden forest (園林) grown for 300 years, the vine leaves of nameless strange wild berries (풋딸기), wild grapes (머루), hardy kiwis (다래), and ivy adorned the valley entrance (谷口) with particularly poignant crimson maples of a thousand purples and reds (千紫萬紅). It seemed as if it were a direct expression of the beautiful and pure spirit (靈) of the bygone Lady Sukpin Ch'oe (淑嬪崔氏). It would perhaps not be an excessive rash statement (妄發) to say it felt like a beautiful comfort to the heart of this group of sightseeing men who had sought out this place from 60 ri away.

Combining the unofficial history by Yi Sŏkch'on (李石村野史) and the explanation of Attendant Kwak (郭參奉), who personally guided us after arranging his attire (衣冠), when Prince Yŏnin (延礽君), the second son of King Sukchong (肅宗大王) and later King Yŏngjo (英祖大王), the Crown Prince Brother (世弟) to his elder brother King Kyŏngjong (景宗大王), was still Prince Yŏnin, his mother Lady Sukpin Ch'oe passed away (昇選). After she was enshrined here, he built a one-room thatched hut (一間草堂) at the foot of Soryŏngwŏn mountain and visited the grave (省墓) with utmost sincerity (至誠) for three years. That thatched hut has also been moved and preserved (移存) in the rear garden (後園) behind the ritual preparation hall (齊所) to the right of the tomb garden (園), appearing as it did then. It is said that the short staff (短笻), marked by use (손때), that King Yŏngjo used every morning when ascending to the gravesite (山所) is kept there. Furthermore, before King Yŏngjo (英廟) ascended the throne (登極), his filial piety (孝誠) was so extreme (至極) that he built a separate room (別室) behind the Soryŏngwŏn ritual preparation hall and hung a plaque reading "Yugodang" (六吾堂). This expressed the meaning of self-sufficiency (自足) with six things of his own: his house, his possessions, his water, his food, etc. Today, Yugodang serves as the quarters for the Royal Tomb Attendant (陵叅奉舍廊). After King Yŏngjo ascended the throne, it was customary (依例) that commoners' gravesites (山所) were not permitted on land belonging to the royal family (王家). However, King Yŏngjo, being benevolent and generous (仁厚), commanded (吩咐) that since devotion to parents is the same (一般) for kings (君王) and commoners (庶民), the graves should absolutely not (一切) be excavated (發堀), but rather made level with the ground (平土藏), and visits to the graves in spring and autumn (春秋省墓) should continue as before. Consequently, not only the commoners with gravesites at Soryŏngwŏn, but the entire village (洞內) was filled with voices of gratitude (感激聲) for this awing and grateful (惶感) measure (處分).

Soryŏngwŏn is famous as the gravesite of a consort (妃嬪) of the wise ruler (明主) Sukchong and the mother (母堂) of the wise king (英君) Yŏngjo, but Lady Sukpin Ch'oe (淑嬪崔氏) herself is even more praised (稱譽) by the people of the world (世人) for being the protagonist (主人公) of outstanding feminine virtue (淑德) in the secret history of the palace (宮中秘史).

King Sukchong (肅宗大王), the 19th monarch of the Yi Dynasty (李朝 第19代), was famous for his night patrols (夜巡). One winter night, while patrolling within the grand palace (大闕), he reached the front of a palace woman's (宮女) room. Though it was already the third watch (三更, 11 PM-1 AM), lamplight shone brightly through the window (窓). Finding it strange (怪異), he abruptly entered the room. A beautiful woman (佳人) was sitting under the lamp making rice cakes (떡). Startled by this unexpected intrusion (突入), she was alarmed and bewildered (愴惶罔措), <143> bowing her head to the ground awaiting punishment (頓首待罪). Amidst her elegant and refined (端雅) demeanor (行色), the reason (曲節) for making rice cakes in the middle of the night made him even more curious.

"Why are you awake making rice cakes so late at night (深夜)?"
"Your humble servant (小婢) was a lady-in-waiting (侍女) to the deposed Queen Min (廢宮되신 前閔中殿). Tomorrow is Her Majesty's birthday (生辰). Though she is deposed, I cannot forget her past kindness (恩惠), so I was making the rice cakes she always liked (平時에 좋아하시던 떡). I have been discovered before Your Majesty (上監眼前에 發現), so I await punishment with death (죽엄으로써 待罪하노이다)." she reported respectfully and fearfully (恭惶이 아뢰온다) without faltering. Five years earlier, King Sukchong, infatuated (沉惑) with Chang Hŭibin (張禧嬪), had subjected Pak T'ae-bo (朴泰輔), who offered loyal remonstrance (忠諫), to severe punishment (嚴刑) and exile (귀양), leading to the tragedy (慘劇) of his death (致死) at Noryangjindu (鷺梁津頭), while deposing the wise and virtuous (賢淑) Queen Min (閔中殿), who had even completed the three-year mourning period (三年喪) for the previous king (先王), and appointing Chang Hŭibin as Queen (中宮). Five years later, hearing the public resentment (民怨) regarding Queen Min and reading old books (古書), he was fully (十分) repenting (悔悟) his temporary (一時) mistake. The existence of such a loyal maidservant (忠婢) proved (證明) the immense virtue and reputation (德望) of Queen Min. Sukchong found her admirable (佳爽) and said, "Attend me tonight (侍寢해라)." "Since the former Queen (前中宮) is deposed, your humble servant is also a criminal (罪人). How could I attend Your Majesty's dragon body (龍體를 뫼시오리까)?" the palace woman declined (辭) with tears. Sukchong, moved even more by her praiseworthy feminine virtue (淑德의 갸륵함과) and elegant beauty (姿色의 端雅함에), said,
"If you attend me tonight, I will restore Queen Min (閔妃를 復位하리라) tomorrow."
"This is a boundless (罔極) measure (處分) for all time (千秋)! For the sake of the former Queen, how could I refuse (辭하오리까) the royal command (御令)?" Sukchong was greatly satisfied (滿足) and said,
"Hereafter, if you bear a son, I shall make you Queen (中宮을 封하리라)."
The palace woman quietly gathered her clothes (衣裳) and went outside. When she did not return after a short while (食頃), Sukchong found it strange (怪異). Pushing open the window (映窓) and shining the lamplight (燈燭), he saw someone kneeling (屈服) silently in the garden below (庭下) where white snowflakes were falling. He rushed out in surprise and saw it was the palace woman. She was near death (濱死의 地境), her limbs frozen. He carried her inside with his own hands (親手), laid her by the warmest part of the floor (아래목), and rubbed her hands and feet (手足) to warm them. After a while (이윽고), she regained consciousness (깨는지라). "What is the meaning of this?" The palace woman, collecting her senses (精神을 收拾), knelt before the throne (御前), touching her head to the ground, and said, "Looking at historical records (史記) of old, it is a fundamental principle and law (大經大法) not to appoint a lowly maidservant (賤婢) as Queen (中宮/王后). Since my mistress (上典) is the deposed Queen, for Your Majesty to say you would appoint a lowly servant like me as Queen is an unbearable (勘當 못하올) measure (處分). Therefore (仍하야), I could only await punishment (罪를 기다림) with death (死로써)."
As tears streamed down like rain, she politely and subtly (慇懃이) pleaded (呼訴) for Queen Min, mentioning her virtue (淑德) at every turn. Chang Hŭibin, who had become Queen (中宮), was also originally (元來) one of the palace women. Pointing out (指定) that making herself Queen was not according to the fundamental principles and laws (大經大法) also contained (包含) the meaning that appointing Chang Hŭibin as Queen was also Your Majesty's mistake. Hearing this, Sukchong said,
"Your words are right. I shall reappoint Queen Min (閔中을 다시 封하리라)." <144>
The next day (翌日), after the morning assembly (朝會後), he restored Lady Min (閔氏) as Queen (中宮). He also decreed (下敎) that a shrine (祀堂) be built for Pak T'ae-bo, who died from the ill effects of punishment (刑毒) at Noryangjin, and that rites be performed in spring and autumn (春秋奉祭). He lamented that it was an eternal regret (千秋에 恨) that Pak T'ae-bo could not live to see this day. This was all an expression (發露) of that palace woman's utmost feminine virtue (至極한 淑德). She was precisely the Lady Ch'oe who was enfeoffed as Sukpin (淑嬪). That chance meeting (邂逅) that night not only led to the restoration of Queen Min but also to the birth of a brilliant (英特) king like Yŏngjo. Therefore, Lady Ch'oe of Yuksanggung (毓祥宮崔氏), the protagonist of Soryŏngwŏn, makes the memory (記憶) of that garden even fresher for later generations (後人).

We ate the lunch (點心) we had brought (携來) with relish (甘食) on the lawn in front of the garden's red spiked gate (園紅箭門앞). Entering the stele pavilion for the spirit path (神道碑閣) on the right side (右側) of the village entrance (洞口) outside the garden (園外), we saw the stone tortoise (石龜) base supporting the Soryŏngwŏn spirit path stele. Among Yi Dynasty (李朝) stone works (石工物), it must be the foremost in its grand scale (規模) and stately (堂堂) martial air (武風). The protruding forehead (額部) and the look in the eyes (눈초리) of the tortoise are brilliant (영특) and imbued with a martial air, looking exactly as if (宛然) a living tortoise (生龜) is about to move right now (方今). Here, we thanked Attendant Kwak (郭叅奉) repeatedly (再三謝禮) and started on our return path (回路) around 3 PM (午後 3時頃).

(Pogwangsa Temple 普光寺) Below Tŏkp'aryŏng Pass (德坡嶺), we turned left (左便) and proceeded for about two *majang* (2馬場). At the entrance to Koryŏngsan valley (古靈山洞口), pine and juniper trees (松檜) over a *chang* (丈餘, ~3m) tall stood densely (葱立), evoking images of high mountain dense forests (高山密林). Bodhi trees (?) (陪提樹) and crimson maples (丹楓) colored the valley entrance red like rouge (臙脂하였다). Passing through the entrance of this deep and secluded (深邃) dense forest, the old temple (古刹) Pogwangsa, built at the end of the Goryeo Dynasty (麗末 興建), appeared, nestled gently (나붓이) beneath Koryŏngsan mountain, which resembled a folding screen (屛風).
Although it is clearly a grand temple (雄刹), counted among the huge temples (巨刹), its antique look (古色) is so venerable (蒼然), one cannot help but feel (不禁) the long years it has passed through appear quite somber (愀然).
A special note (特記) about this temple (寺刹) is that it enshrines the ancestral tablet (位牌) of Lady Sukpin Ch'oe and performs rites in spring and autumn (春秋祭典). Also preserved are two *Sŭngp'ung* devices (昇風 2臺) handwritten (親筆) by King Yŏngjo when he was studying at Soryŏngwŏn as Prince Yŏnin (延礽君). His royal handwriting (御筆跡), detailing (昭詳) an astronomical chart (天文學圖解) and a dissected analysis (解剖) of a desk clock (坐鳴鍾/時計) showing the gears (齒輪) and internal mechanism (內部裝置) with explanations written in neat characters (正字), might be of value (一考의 價値) for those researching (硏究) astronomy. It is a great regret (一大遺憾) that their preservation (保管) has not been careful (愼重), leading to damage from bookworms (좀) and deterioration (弊態). The main hall pillars made of single trunks (大雄寶殿의 통기둥) and the structure enshrining the Buddha statue (佛像을 鎭座한 달집/懸閣) are famous for being from the time of its founding (創建時) over a thousand years ago (千餘年前). Concerned about sunset (日墓를 念慮), we substituted a visit to Soram Hermitage (率庵), located below Tongmu Peak (篤鵡峯) of Koryŏngsan, with memories from our visit the year before last (一昨年 探訪) and proceeded directly on our return path. Unfortunately, my foot worsened (발덧이 나서), so I sent the advance party (先發隊) ahead and returned with my friend Chu Yang-go (養高朱君) via Muak Pass (舞學재) under the bright moon (明月) following the full moon (望後), arriving at 10:30 PM. It was an invigorating (壯快) round trip (往復) itinerary (日程) of over 120 ri.
Postscript (附記)=For those who find walking (步行) difficult, using the shared taxi service (乘合車便) to Pyŏkchekwan (碧蹄舘) would allow one to see Soryŏngwŏn and Pogwangsa and return without excessive fatigue (疲困). <145>

**Summary**

This travelogue excerpt describes a journey taken in the autumn of 1935 or earlier (published Jan 1936) to Soryŏngwŏn, the tomb of Lady Sukpin Ch'oe (mother of King Yeongjo), and the nearby Pogwangsa Temple, passing through the historic Pyŏkchekwan area north of Seoul. The author details the scenery, the large-scale logging operations presumably by Japanese interests, the history associated with Soryŏngwŏn, including anecdotes about King Yeongjo's filial piety and the famous story of how his mother, a palace maid, gained King Sukjong's favor through her loyalty to the deposed Queen Inhyeon, leading to the Queen's reinstatement and Yeongjo's birth. The author also describes Pogwangsa Temple, its connection to Sukpin Ch'oe, and artifacts related to King Yeongjo kept there. The piece concludes with practical travel advice. For colonial history, the article is interesting for its casual yet stark mention of extensive logging by a "Japanese mainlander" leasing forest land from a Korean official, highlighting resource extraction. It also shows the continued reverence for Joseon royal history and sites among Koreans during this period, alongside the adoption of modern transport like shared taxis.

肅宗嬪墓昭寧園, 古戰場碧蹄舘을 지나면서(續)
						崔鳳則
우리는 따스한 가을해만이 發射해 주는 光線을 받으면서 여기에만 特産인 밤보숭이의 인절미를 10냥 어치 사 들고 어린아이같이 행길로 가며 立花宗茂처럼 단숨에 古戰地를 突擊하기에 多少 虛氣를 感한 腹臟에 饒饑하면서 碧蹄里 街道를 지나 호랑굴(虎穴)편 惠陰嶺마루를 西으로 바라보며 右便으로 웃골(上谷)에 끔직이도 斫伐하여 中天까지 太山처럼 쌓아놓은 長斫데미를 路傍에 놀랍게 보며 役夫더러 이 어이한 長斫인가고 물으니 議政府 某當者가 德坡嶺(俗稱 되빡고개) 前後 山林을 貸付한 日本內地人의 所有를 昨年에 契約하고 斫伐한 것입니다고. 嶺前後에 쌓인 것이 京城 40萬 府民의 一朔燃料에 可敢할지라는 놀라운 장작데미들이다. 海技 270米의 傾斜가 稍急한 되빡고개를 넘어서니 여기서부터 楊州郡 境內이다. 金色이 秋陽에 照耀하는 田畓의 秋收하는 多事한 農村의 가을 風景에 <142> 醉하야 혹은 수수밭으로 혹은 논밭으로 혹은 細川의 돌다리를 밟으면서 고개에서 한 10里남아 行路를 계속하니 젓나무와 落落長松과 자작나무들이 深邃하니 버러진 白石面 靈場里, 300米 高嶺下에 奇異하게 秋色을 返射해 주는 여기가 바로 昭寧園이다.
勿論 英祖大王의 嬪李氏墓인 綏吉園도 이 入口 右便에 있음을 잊지 아니한다.
300年이나 길르고 자란 園林사이로 이름 모를 奇異한 풋딸기와 머루며 다래와 담쟁이들의 넝쿨잎새들은 有別하게도 千紫萬紅의 애틋한 丹楓으로 谷口를 丹裝한 것은 옛날 淑嬪崔氏의 곱고도 맑은 靈의 表現을 그대로 그린 양 싶어서 60里 먼 길을 찾은 무레 사네의 探勝者의 마음을 아리답게도 위로해 주심 같으시다면 過한 妄發은 아니리라.
李石村野史와 衣冠을 整齊하고 나서 친히 案內해 주시는 郭參奉의 說明을 紏合하면 肅宗大王의 둘재 아드님이시오, 그 兄 景宗大王의 世弟(英祖大王)로 冊封되시기 前 延祁君으로 계실 때에 母堂淑嬪崔氏가 昇選하신 뒤에 이리로 모시자 昭寧園山 밑 所에 一間草堂을 짓고 3年間을 至誠으로 省墓 하시있는데 그 草堂도 至今 園 右便齊所後園에 移存하야 예런 듯 保存되었는데 거기에는 英祖께서 每朝 山所에 오르나리실제 쓰시던 손때 앉인 短笻을 保管해 두었다 한다. 그러고 英廟登極하시기 前에 孝誠이 至極하야 昭寧園齊所 뒤에 別室을 짓고 六吾堂이라는 현판을 달었으니, 이는 내 집 내 所有에 내 물마시고 내 밥먹고 등 여섯가지 내 것으로 自足하다는 뜻을 表함이다. 至今은 六吾堂이 바로 陵叅奉舍廊으로 되어 있다. 英祖大王이 登極하신 뒤에 王家의 山地가 되면 庶民의 山所는 依例이 不許하는 것이다. 그러나 英祖는 仁厚하시어 父母를 위하기는 君王이나 庶民이 一般이라, 一切 發堀하지 말고 다만 平土藏으로 하야 春秋省墓를 여전히 하라는 吩咐가 계섰다. 그리하야 昭寧園에 山所가 있는 庶民은 勿論, 온 洞內가 惶感한 處分에 感激聲이 滋滋하였다.
昭寧園은 明主인 肅宗의 妃嬪이오 英君인 英祖의 母堂의 山所임에도 有名하거니와 淑嬪崔氏 그 어른 自體가 宮中秘史에 一代 뛰어난 淑德의 主人公으로 해서 더욱이 世人의 稱姿를 받게 되는 것이다.
夜巡하시기로 이름 난 肅宗大王(李朝 第19代 이 겨울 어떤 날 밤 大闕안에서 夜巡을 도시다가 한 宮女의 房 앞에 이르니 밤이 이미 3更이잇만 燈燭이 환이 窓에 비치는지라, 怪異여겨 그 房으로 쑥 들어서니 한떨기의 佳人이 燈下에 떡을 빚고 앉었다가 이 뜻하지 아니한 突入에 愴惶罔措하야 <143> 頓首待罪인데 그 行色이 端雅한 中에도 밤중에 떡을 빚는 曲節이 더욱 궁금하오서,
『네, 深夜에 잠 안들고 떡은 빚이 무삼일고?』
『네, 小婢는 廢宮되신 前閔中殿 마마의 侍女온데 明日이 그 마마의 生辰이시라, 平時에 좋아하시던 떡을 비록 廢宮하섰다 하와도 옛 恩惠를 잊을 길 없사와 이 떡을 빚으옵다가 上監眼前에 發現이오니 죽엄으로써 待罪하노이다.』
고 조금도 서들지 않고 恭惶이 아뢰온다. 肅宗은 5年前 張禧嬪에 沉惑하셔 忠諫하는 朴泰輔를 嚴刑의 餘에 귀양보내여 鷺梁津頭에 致死의 慘劇까지 이르키면서 先王의 3年喪까지 가치 지난 賢淑한 閔中殿을 廢하고 張禧嬪으로 中宮을 封하였던 것이다. 그 後 5年에 閔잘에 대한 民怨을 듣고 古書를 읽는 중에 當身의 一時 잘못을 10分 悔悟턴 머리에 이렇든 忠婢가 있음은 閔中殿의 德望이 至大함을 證明함이라. 肅宗은 佳爽이 여기시며 『오늘밤에 侍寢해라』 한즉 『前中宮께옵서 廢宮이시니, 小婢亦 罪人이라 어찌 龍體를 뫼시오리까』하고 宮女는 눈물로 辭하매 肅宗은 그 淑德의 갸륵함과 姿色의 端雅함에 더욱이 情을 움직이시어
『네 오늘밤 侍寢하면 明日에 閔妃를 復位하리라.』
『千秋에 罔極하신 處分이오니 前마마를 위하와 어찌 御令을 辭하오리까!』 肅宗은 대단이 滿足하시어
『네 이후에 아들을 낳거던 널로 中宮을 封하리라』
宮女는 고요이 衣裳을 끌며 밖으로 나간다. 두이 食頃이 지나도록 돌아오지 아니하매 肅宗께서는 怪異이 여겨 映窓을 밀고 燈燭을 비치니 흰 눈발 날리는 庭下에 무언 屈服하었다. 놀라 뛰여나와 보시니 그 宮女라. 사지가 얼어 濱死의 地境인 것을 親手로 안고 房으로 드오셔 아래목에 입히고 手足을 주무르고 녹히니 이윽고 깨는지라. 『이 무삼 일인고?』 宮女 精神을 收拾하야 御前에 屈伏하야 머리를 땅에 쪼아리면서  『옛날 史記를 보오면 賤婢를 들어 中宮(王后)을 封치 아니하옴은 大經大法이옵는데 小婢의 上典이 廢宮中이시온 바에 賤婢인 저로 中宮을 封하신다 하옴은 勘當 못하올 處分이시라, 仍하야 死로써 罪를 기다림이외다.』
고 눈물이 비오듯 하면서 閔中殿을 위하야 말끝마다 淑德을 慇懃이 呼訴한다. 中宮으로 된 張禧嬪도 元來 宮女中 一人이라. 自己로써 中宮됨이 大經大法이 아님을 指定함은 역시 張禧濱으로 中宮을 封함도 上監의 잘못이란 뜻을 包含함이라. 肅宗께서 들으시고
『네 이 말 옳다. 내 閔中을 다시 封하리라.』 <144>
하시고 그 翌日 朝會後에 閔氏를 다시 中宮으로 復位하시고 鷺梁津에서 刑毒으로 죽은 朴泰輔의 祀堂을 세워 春秋奉祭하라. 下敎하시며 朴泰輔가 살아 今日의 일을 못봄이 千秋에 恨이라 하섰으니, 이는 그 宮女의 至極한 淑德의 發露인 바 그가 바로 淑嬪으로 封해 온 崔氏요, 그날 밤 邂逅로 해서 閔中殿 復位뿐만 아니라 英祖같으신 英特한 大王을 낳은 것이다. 그러므로 해서 昭寧園의 主人公 毓祥宮崔氏는 그 園으로 하여금 後人의 記憶을 더욱 새롭게 한다.
園紅箭門앞 잔디밭에서 携來한 點心을 甘食하고 園外 洞口 右側 神道碑閣에 들어서니 李朝石工物로는 그 規模의 크기와 武風이 堂堂한 돌거북으로는 昭寧園神道碑의 바침 石龜가 제1일 것이다. 빼여든 거북의 額部와 눈초리가 영특하고도 武風이 서린 것이 宛然이 生龜가 方今 動하려는 것 같다. 여기서 郭叅奉에게 再三謝禮하고 回路에 오르니 午後 3時頃.

(普光寺) 德坡嶺 밑에서 左便으로 한 2馬場 들어서니 古靈山洞口에 高山密林을 聯想하리만큼 丈餘의 松檜가 葱立하였고 陪提樹와 丹楓이 谷口를 臙脂하였다. 이러한 深邃한 密林의 洞口를 지나 들어서니 屛風같은 古靈山下에 나붓이 자리잡은 麗末에 興建한 古刹 普光寺가 나타난다.
반듯이 巨刹의 1로 볼 수 있는 雄刹이면서도 古色이 하도 蒼然하아 옛날의 긴 歲月을 經過해 온 樣子가 너무나 秋然해 보임을 不禁한다.
이 寺刹의 特記할 것은 淑嬪崔氏의 位牌를 모시어 春秋祭典을 드림과 英祖大王이 延礽君으로 昭寧園에 계시며 工夫하시던 때에 親筆로 쓰신 昇風 2臺가 있는데 天文學圖解와 坐鳴鍾(時計)을 解剖하야 齒輪과 內部裝置를 昭詳이 그리고 解說을 正字로 써두신 御筆跡은 天文學을 硏究하는 이로는 一考의 價値가 있지 않을가 한다. 保管이 愼重치 아니하야 좀이 먹고 弊態가 흐름은 一大遺憾이 아닐 수 없다. 大雄寶殿의 통기둥과 佛像을 鎭座한 달집(懸閣)은 千餘 年前 創建時의 것으로 有名하다. 古靈山 篤鵡峯下에 있는 *率庵은 日墓를 念慮하야 一昨年 探訪으로 代하고 그냥 回路에 올랐다. 不幸이 발덧이 나서 先發隊를 먼저 보내고 養高朱君과 가치 덧 望後의 明月을 띠고 舞學재로 돌아드니 밤 十時 半. 往復120里餘의 壯快한 日程이다.
附記=步行이 어려운 이는 碧蹄舘까지 乘合車便을 利用하면 昭寧園과 普光寺를 보고 돌아와도 過히 疲困치 않을 것이다. <145>
