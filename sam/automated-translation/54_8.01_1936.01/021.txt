**Summary**

This news article from early 1936 celebrates the Japanese Imperial Family at the start of the year, detailing the auspicious health of the young Crown Prince Akihito and providing extensive biographical information on Emperor Hirohito and Empress Nagako, emphasizing their lineage, education, military ranks, and ceremonial duties. It briefly mentions the Korean royal family residing in Ch'angdŏk Palace, noting the Queen Dowager's age and health, and King Yi's military service under the Japanese. For historians, the article starkly illustrates the colonial power dynamic: the Japanese Imperial Family is described with lavish detail and extreme deference, symbolizing their supreme authority, while the former Korean royal family receives only a brief, almost cursory mention, highlighting their diminished status under Japanese rule as the "Yi Royal Family" (李王家). The detailed timeline of the Emperor's life serves as propaganda reinforcing his legitimacy and central role in the Empire, which included Korea.
