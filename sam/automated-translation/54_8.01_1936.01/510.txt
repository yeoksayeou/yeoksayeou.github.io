Thoughts on Welcoming the New Year (迎新有感)

At the sound of the first rooster's crow for the new year, the new spring, did you set out after having had a good dream last night? As we greet the dawn of the new year in the East (東方), the desire to pray for the happiness of the Brothers and Sisters (兄弟姊妹) of this Land and Rivers (江山) arises even more intensely, like a burning fire.

What this magazine takes pride in for this "New Year Issue," which marks the beginning of our 8th year of publication, is gathering and publishing the works of nearly 20 great stars (巨星) of our literary world (文壇). We believe this will be a great harvest (收穫) for the literary scene, which has been desolate (寂寥), something unseen in recent times.

Though we thought of increasing the number of pages (頁數), we decided to provide that as a service (써-비스) in the next issue, the Lunar New Year (陰曆) issue, and reluctantly kept it to this size, omitting (割愛) everything else. Lastly, we hope that all our Brothers (兄弟) will love and support (愛護) this magazine even more in the new year.<320>

**Summary**

This editorial postscript from the January 1936 issue of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine welcomes the New Year, expressing wishes for the happiness of the Korean people ("Brothers and Sisters of this Land and Rivers"). It highlights the special New Year's issue, celebrating its 8th anniversary, which features works by nearly twenty prominent writers, presented as a major achievement for the contemporary literary scene. The editors apologize for not increasing the page count, promising it for the upcoming Lunar New Year issue, and appeal for continued reader support. For historians, this piece reflects the cultural milieu of colonial Korea, showing a Korean publication striving to maintain literary output and foster a sense of national community ("Brothers and Sisters," "Land and Rivers") despite the political climate. The mention of a "desolate" literary scene and the pride in gathering "great stars" indicate the challenges and perceived importance of cultural figures during this period.
