Article Title: 相逢朴順天 (Meeting Pak Sunch'ŏn)
Author: 梁權煥
Article Type: 시 (Poem)

Is it real or a dream, meeting in this life?
Joy and sorrow intertwine, enough to tear the heart.

Hot tears block the view, wanting to speak but hesitating.
Shaking shoulders, sobbing, the heart aches intensely.

Why was I dead in the past? Not forgetting the world.
Coming out to meet, the anticipated reunion is entirely different.

Old skills are used according to old ways;
The two people can hardly find their former appearances.

Composing minds, adjusting postures, each sits calmly.
Discussing floating past events brings tears again.

Already fifty years lived, a traveler on a rugged path.
How much remaining life is there? Leave it to fate.

Now we part again, when shall we meet?
Difficult to unite as before; perhaps only death will end it.

If you wish to know if I live or die, perhaps find it on paper.
My name is not seen amidst times of peace (太平).

Human life is laughable, these hundred years.
Joy, strangeness, love, hate, old age, death – all are empty.

After death, praise or blame, who can know?
Before death, one drink arrives, attacked by sorrow. <59>

**Summary**

This poem by Yang Kwŏnhwan describes an emotional reunion with Pak Sunch'ŏn after a long separation. The poet expresses mixed feelings of joy and sorrow, noting how both have aged and changed. They reflect on the hardships faced ("traveler on a rugged path"), the uncertainty of their remaining lives, and the difficulty of meeting again. The poem ends on a somber, somewhat existential note, questioning the meaning of life, fame, and finding solace only in drink against sorrow. From a historical perspective, the poem offers insight into the personal experiences of Korean intellectuals or figures during the colonial period. The lines "My name is not seen amidst times of peace" and the general tone of hardship and difficult reunions hint at the constrained lives and potential political suppression faced by individuals like Pak Sunch'ŏn (a known independence activist) and the author.

相逢朴順天
						梁權煥
眞歟夢矣今生逢. 交錯喜悲可裂胞.
熱淚掩前欲語遲. 搖肩欷咽心腸恫.
余何昔死非忘世. 出見豫期盡不同.
故工由用依古色. 兩人難覔舊時容.
整心校態各安坐. 徃事論浮更淚蒙.
半百旣生崎路客. 餘牲幾許任從夙.
今且相別何時會. 難合如前寧死終.
生死欲知或紙上. 余名不見太平中.
人生可笑百年間. 喜怪愛憎老死空.
後毁譽誰可識. 生前一醉到愁攻.＜59＞
