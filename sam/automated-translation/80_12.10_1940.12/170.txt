A Model Among Soldiers

On October 12th last, a delegation of 35 male and female writers, organized by the Korean Writers' Association (朝鮮文人協會), visited the Army Volunteer Training Center (陸軍兵志願者訓練所) and were deeply moved after personally observing the life there. Furthermore, they heard the following moving and exemplary story from Director Kaida (海田所長).

Superior Private Songgok Am (松谷岩) (former name Chŏng Tong-am, 鄭銅巖), currently serving in the Ranam Unit (羅南部隊), is a native of Sunch'ŏn. After finishing elementary school there, he entered the Training Center as a first-term recruit. Having graduated with excellent results, he was assigned to the Ranam Unit headquarters, where he serves to this day. Receiving one Diligence Badge (精勤章) after the first six months, and then subsequently receiving the Diligence Badge for diligence in duty and excellent performance, awarded every five months thereafter, a total of four times in succession, is truly a very rare occurrence even among soldiers from the Mainland (內地人, i.e., Japanese). It is said that even if only two or three soldiers in one unit receive it, they are highly praised as considerably diligent individuals. For a volunteer soldier (志願兵) to set such a fine example is truly astonishing. <127>

**Summary**

This news article from 1940 highlights the exemplary service of a Korean volunteer soldier, Songgok Am (formerly Chŏng Tong-am), serving in the Japanese army's Ranam Unit. He is praised for earning four consecutive Diligence Badges, an achievement noted as rare even for Japanese soldiers. The story was related to visiting members of the Korean Writers' Association by the Training Center Director. From a historical perspective, the article is significant as it reflects the Japanese colonial authorities' efforts to promote and glorify Korean participation in the military, using figures like Songgok Am as role models to encourage volunteering, especially as Japan's war efforts intensified. The involvement of the Korean Writers' Association in visiting the training center also points towards the mobilization of cultural figures for state propaganda purposes during this period.

兵士中의 模範
지난 10월 12일, 朝鮮文人協會 주최로 남녀문인 35명의 견학단이 陸軍兵志願者訓練所를 訪問하고 친히 그 생활을 보고 감격을 不禁했는데 다시 海田所長으로부터 다음과 같은 감격미담을 듣게 되였다.
현재 羅南部隊에 있는 松谷岩(舊名 鄭銅巖)上等兵은 順天 출생으로 그곳 小學校를 마치고 第1期生으로 訓練所에 입소하였다가 優秀한 成績으로 羅南隊部에 所屬되여 금일까지 근무하고 있는데 최초 6개월만에 精勤章을 하나 타고 그 다음 5개월마다 타는 勤務勉勵成績優秀의 精勤章을 연거퍼 네 개나 탓다는 것은 실로 內地人 軍人 중에서도 매우 드믄 일이며 한 部隊에서 둘이나 셋만 타도 상당한 精勤者로 稱頌이 자못 높은데 志願兵으로써 이와 같은 좋은 모범을 나타낸 것은 매우 驚嘆할 일이라 한다. ＜127＞
