Genius Sculptor Mr. Kim Pokchin
						Ch'unwŏn / Kim Ŭnho / Pang Ŭngmo

After our pride, the famed figure of the Peninsula's sculpture world, Mr. Kim Pokchin (older brother of the critic Ip'ong, Kim Kijin), suddenly passed away, a memorial service for the deceased and an exhibition of his remaining works were held last late autumn on October 5th at the Kyŏngsŏng Public Hall (京城府民館) assembly room, drawing a large crowd of several hundred people and proving a great success. Furthermore, at the memorial ceremony presided over by Mr. Yi Kwangu, mournful eulogies by Messrs. Yŏ Unhyŏng, Pang Ŭngmo, Yi Kwangsu, and Kim Ŭnho moved the bereaved family and friends to tears. We now record three of the eulogies from that day to console the lonely spirit of this ill-fated, short-lived genius artist.

Unfinished Guanyin Statue - Ch'unwŏn

Chŏnggwan and I were not what you would call intimate friends. The number of times we sat together and talked probably doesn't exceed ten in our entire lives. Yet, Chŏnggwan and I were friends who could not forget each other.

Years ago, Chŏnggwan visited me carrying Xuan paper (宣紙). He asked me to write a horizontal scroll (橫額). I treated it as a joke (弄談). Still, Chŏnggwan insisted firmly. "It's not that I consider Ch'unwŏn a master calligrapher (筆家) and am asking you to write; it's because I want to hang Ch'unwŏn's writing (글시) in my room," he said. Unable to refuse, I wrote out the phrase from the I Ching, "The town may be moved, but the well cannot be moved. It suffers no decrease and no increase. Those who come and go draw from the well." (「井改邑不改井往來井井无喪无得」). Later, when I visited Chŏnggwan's house, I saw what I had written, mounted (表具), hanging in his second-floor room overlooking Sajiktan Altar. <167>

Early one cold morning last spring, Chŏnggwan unexpectedly visited me. He said he was on his way to visit Tokyo (東京) and leaving the next day. We talked for about two hours. This was the longest conversation the two of us ever had.

Chŏnggwan sat with his hands tucked under his knees, shaking his long hair, and spoke quite cheerfully. He talked about building a house overlooking the Han River (漢江); about wanting to build a small hermitage in the mountains and spend the rest of his life there; about having a comrade with whom he would live as a monk; about having received ordination at a temple in Asakusa (淺草) during his studies in Tokyo; about how people say he earns money, but what money is there? After endless talk like this on various topics, he asked what souvenir (miyage) I wanted him to bring back from Tokyo. I asked him to carve a sandalwood Guanyin statue (白檀觀音像). At this, he took a sandalwood Guanyin statue from his pocket and showed it to me, so I specified I wanted one carved by Chŏnggwan's own hand (손소).

When Chŏnggwan came to see me after returning from Tokyo, he seemed very busy and also troubled about something. He said he couldn't find sandalwood in Tokyo and thus couldn't carve the Guanyin statue, promising to find some later and carve it for me (次次). Without even coming inside, standing at the gate, he seemed to have more to say, yet hesitated, and then bid farewell. This was the final parting (永訣) between Chŏnggwan and me.

Chŏnggwan was someone who came to visit this world for just a short while. Perhaps he came to revive the art of sculpture in Chosŏn (朝鮮) and to create the Buddha statue at Kŭmsan Temple (金山寺). Towards <168> me too, there must surely be some karmic connection (宿緣). We sought each other out several times out of a sudden desire to see one another.

But Chŏnggwan seems to have left without saying all he had to say. The words he had yet to utter seem to be the most important words for him. What could they be? If Chŏnggwan feels inclined, he might suddenly come back to the world again. And continue his eternally unfinished sculpture (永遠한 未完成品의 彫刻).

Words of Long Remembrance - Kim Ŭnho

On the fifth day of the tenth month of the Shōwa Kōshin year (昭和庚辰十月五日), your friend Kim Ŭnho of Sangsan (商山), composing a few lines, tearfully reports and pays respects before the spirit of the late esteemed Chŏnggwan Kim. Alas! You, my friend (惟君), were a pillar (棟樑), with striking eyes and a prominent face (魁顔), an imposing physique (軀幹堂堂), a spirit that could swallow the blue sea (氣呑滄海). Your conduct, valuing heaven within (天中行何貴), tended towards the impetuous and eccentric (寧涉狷狂). Introspecting (內視), your source was like dew (露源), warm jade and fine gems (溫玉琳琅). You looked askance at the eight corners of the world (脾睨八極), soaring like a cloud-crane (雲鵠翶翔). You engaged not in worldly business (不作家業), cared not for personal appearance (不理身粧). Your standards were lofty, your elegance clear (標高韻淸), possessing a heavenly fragrance (有浥天香). Divinity resided within you (神明爲舍), art was your calling (藝術爲卿). Your carving and sculpting (雕鎪刻琢) showed abundant natural talent (天分攸長). Depicting things with lifelikeness (狀物惟肖), your spirit was brilliant (神釆琅琅). Beautifying the wilderness (美化莣蕪), you achieved brilliance without pause (無日就煒煌). I believed you possessed an extraordinary endowment (禀受非常). Enduring hardships like combing hair in wind and bathing in rain (風雨櫛沐), your body was strong (肌骨康强). Striving day and night (日夜征邁), hoping for eagle-like soaring (庶幾鷹揚). But Heaven's favor did not continue (天眷不繼), leading people to meet disaster (啓人姤殃). Reaching the end of water and mountains (水盡山窮), encountering misfortune ahead (逢前鬼倀). How fleeting was our friendship (惠好何時), passing through kalpas and ages (過劫滄桑)? Tearfully I clutch my chest (潸然撫膺), feeling a pain like thrusting halberds and spears (如戟突槍). Where is our old promise (夙盟何居)? Sweat flows like thick soup (汗流如漿). Water flows away, leaving one empty-handed (水去住空手); resentment pierces the blue sky (恨徹穹蒼). There are tears in the north hall (北堂有淚) from grey-haired parents (黃髮爺孃). Flowers scatter in the brotherly garden (花飛棣園), the moon falls on the zither case (月墮琴狀). Looking back upon the human world (券顧人間), you hesitate and wander (跼躅彷徨). The great fruit, the remaining fetus (碩果遺胎), can support the lineage (可扶線陽). After extreme misfortune comes prosperity (否極泰來), you will surely see better days (會見隆昌). Ah, your posthumous works (猗與遺作)! They will become more renowned over time (彌久益彰). Incorruptible and enduring (不磷不緇), their fragrance will flow for a thousand years (千載流芳). In a cloud chariot with mist pendants (雲車霞珮), where do you wander (何處徜徉)? Look up at the Milky Way (仰視雲漢), the brilliant starlight (燦爛星光). Escorted before and behind (前驂後駕), you forever attend the Jade Emperor's court (永卽共朝玉帝), transcending Heaven and Earth (匪厥玄黃). Silently protect this land (黙佑斯土), forever eliminate disasters (永消災障). For hundreds and thousands of vast kalpas (百千浩却), let us never forget each other (長母相忘).

Works and Laments - Pang Ŭngmo

Today, already (居然) the 49th day since the late Chŏnggwan Kim Pokchin suddenly passed away (長逝) amidst our mourning (哀悼裡), as his friends on earth (地上) once again prepare a place of remembrance (追悼), I (不佞), with sincere heart and enduring pain (齊誠忍痛), offer these presumptuous words (妄辭) before the spirit of the deceased, saying: Mr. Kim's outstanding talent and character (逈拔한 才品) and pure and lofty personality (淸高한 人格) were not only sufficient to be our model (儀表), but his pioneering contributions (初創的 功蹟) to our sculpture world (彫塑界) were peerless (獨擅하겠음으로). Thus, our expectations (期待) for him were exceedingly great (컷든 바인데). Abandoning these expectations, he fell like a meteor (隕星) in a single morning. This is something we all grieve together (다함께 슬퍼하는 바이나). My connection (亥分) with him began during the former Chosŏn Ilbo's (前 朝鮮日報) sponsored newspaper exhibition (新聞展覽會), where I received much help from his efforts (努力). He even made a bust (塑像) of me. Since then (以來), I had relied on him as deeply as the sea (海와 가치 倚望해 오든 바). Now, his works (作品) remain (남었으나), but his voice and conversation (聲啖) can no longer be heard (接할 수 없으니). This is something I grieve alone (호흘로 슬퍼하는 바이다). Oh, undimmed noble spirit (不昧의 英靈), please accept this smoke of grief (哀烟을 韻格하소서).
Kōshin Year (庚辰) 10th month 5th day <169>

**Summary**

This article from the December 1940 issue of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine compiles three eulogies delivered at a memorial service for the renowned Korean sculptor Kim Pokchin (art name Chŏnggwan), who had recently passed away. The eulogies, by the famous writer Yi Kwangsu (Ch'unwŏn), the painter Kim Ŭnho, and the newspaper figure Pang Ŭngmo, recall personal anecdotes, praise Kim's artistic genius, pioneering role in Korean sculpture, lofty character, and unconventional lifestyle, and lament his untimely death. Yi Kwangsu reflects on their sparse but meaningful interactions and Kim's unfulfilled artistic potential, Kim Ŭnho offers a highly literary eulogy in classical Chinese celebrating Kim's spirit and talent, and Pang Ŭngmo remembers Kim's help and expresses personal sorrow over the loss of his presence.

For historians of colonial Korea, the article offers insights into the cultural scene and the high esteem held for Kim Pokchin as a foundational figure in modern Korean sculpture, referred to as the "pride" of the "Peninsula's sculpture world." The mention of figures like Yi Kwangsu, Yŏ Unhyŏng, and Pang Ŭngmo, along with institutions like the Kyŏngsŏng Public Hall and the Chosŏn Ilbo, paints a picture of the interconnectedness of the intellectual and artistic elite during this period. The lament for an "ill-fated, short-lived genius" reflects the sense of loss for native cultural development under constrained circumstances. Kim Ŭnho's classical Chinese eulogy also highlights the persistence of traditional literary forms among the elite even in 1940.

天才彫刻家 金復鎭氏
						春園/ 金殷鎬/ 方應謨
우리의 자랑이든 半島彫刻壇의 명성인 金復鎭씨 (評論家 入峰 金基鎭氏 伯氏)가 遽然히 作故한 뒤, 지난 晩秋 10월 5일에 京城府民館 集會室에서 故人의 追悼會와 遺作展을 開催하였는데 數百人士 參集하여 盛况을 이루었다. 더욱 追悼式에는 李寬求씨 司會아래 呂運亨, 方應謨, 李光洙, 金殷鎬 諸氏의 哀切한 吊辭가 있어 遺族과 知友를 울닌 바 잇였다. 이제 當日의 追悼文三篇을, 錄하여, 이 不遇短命한 天才作家의 孤魂을 吊하노라

未完成觀音像 春園

井觀과 나와는 親密하다고 할 만한 程度는 아니었다. 우리 두 사람이 자리를 같이 하야 談話한 回數는 平生을 쳐도 열 번을 넘지 못 할 것이다. 그러면서도 井觀과 나와는 서로 잊지 못하는 벗이었다.
年前 井觀이 宣紙를 들고 나를 찾았다. 날더러 橫額을 쓰라고 하였다. 나는 弄談으로 돌렸다. 그래도 井觀은 굳이 고집하였다. 春園을 筆家로 알고서 쓰라는 것은 아니야, 春園의 글시를 내 房에 걸어 놓고 싶어서 그러는 것이야 하였다. 나는 마지 못하야 「井改邑不改井往來井井无喪无得」이라는 井臥辭를 써들였다. 그 後 井觀宅을 찾았더니 社稷壇이 바라보이는 그 2層 房에서 내가 쓴 것을 表具를 하여서 걸어 놓으신＜167＞ 것을 보았다.
지난 이른 봄 어느 추운 날 아침 일직이 井觀은 不意에 나를 찾아 왔다. 東京을 댕길러 가는 길이라고, 明日 떠난다고 하면서 둘이 두 時間턱이나 이야기를 하였다. 이것이 우리 兩人이 가장 長時間 이야기한 機會였다.
井觀은 두 손을 무릎 밑에 넣고 긴 머리를 흔들어 가면서 자못 愉快하게 말하였다. 漢江이 바라 보이는 곳에 집을 지었노라는 말이며 그러나 山間에 草菴을 하나 짓고 거기서 餘生을 보내겠노라는 말이며, 같이 중 生活을 •œ 同志가 한 사람 있다는 말이며, 또 東京留學時代에 淺草 어느 절에서 得度하였단 말이며, 남들은 돈을 번다고 하나 돈이 무슨 돈이냐 하는 말이며, 이 모양으로 彼此에 끝없는 이야기를 한 끝에 이번 東京에 가면 무슨 미야게를 사다 주랴 하기로 나는 白檀觀音像 하나를 새겨다 달라고 하였다. 이 말에 그는 품속에서 白檀觀音像을 내어서 내게 보이기로 井觀이 손소 새긴 것을 달라고 하였다.
井觀이 東京서 돌아왔노라고 나를 찾았을 때에는 퍽이나 바쁜 듯 하고 또 무슨 근심이 있는 듯 하였다. 東京서 白檀을 못 求하여서 觀音像을 못 새겼노라고, 次次 求해서 새겨주마고 하고는 들어오지도 아니하고 門前에서 무슨 더 할말이 있을뜻 있을뜻 하면서 作別하였다. 이것이 나와 井觀과의 永訣이었다.
井觀은 잠간 이 世上에 댕길러 온 사람이었다. 그는 朝鮮에 彫刻藝術을 復興하고 金山寺佛像을 造成하러 왔던지도 모른다. 내게＜168＞ 對하여서도 必是 무슨 宿緣이 있을 것이다. 불현듯 보고 싶은 생각이 나서 몇 번 서로 찾아 본 것이었다.
井觀은 그러나 할 말을 다 못하고 간 것 같다. 그가 아직 發하지 아니한 말이야말로 그에게 主되게 큰 말인 것 같다. 그 말이 무엇일까. 井觀은 마음만 내키면 불쑥 또 世上에 올 것이다. 그래서 永遠한 未完成品의 彫刻을 繼續할 것이다.

作品과 聲嘆 方應謨

故 井觀 金復鎭씨가 우리들의 哀悼裡에 突然히 長逝한지 居然 49일이 되는 오늘, 地上의 故友들이 다시 追悼의 자리를 베플매 不佞이 齊誠忍痛해서 一文의 妄辭로 故人의 靈前에 告해 가로되, 氏의 逈拔한 才品과 淸高한 人格이 일즉이 우리의 儀表가 되기에 足할 뿐 아니라, 우리 彫塑界에 남긴 初創的 功蹟은 獨擅하겠음으로 우리에 氏에 對한 期待는 더욱 컷든 바인데 이 期待를 버리고 一朝에 隕星과 같이 떠러지니 이것은 우리가 다함께 슬퍼하는 바이나. 不佞과의 亥分은 일직이 前 朝鮮日報 主催의 新聞展覽會 때 氏의 많은 努力을 힘입었으며, 不佞의 塑像까지 만드러 주어 以來 海와 가치 倚望해 오든 바 이제 氏의 作品은 남었으나 氏의 聲啖는 接할 수 없으니 이것은 不佞의 호흘로 슬퍼하는 바이다. 不昧의 英靈은 이 哀烟을 韻格하소서.
