文人談話室 (Writers' Chat Room)
On the Way to Chuŭl
Yi Hyo-sŏk

Although I didn't particularly overdo it or drink excessively during the summer, for some reason my health has become poor, so I unavoidably have to go to the countryside for several months to recuperate. It feels apologetic to rest again right after the long summer vacation has just ended, but I have no choice but to rest for two or three months. Thinking there's no place like Chuŭl, I will go there again. This year, one way or another, it seems I ended up not writing any decent work. Perhaps I'll put out something good next year instead.

Idle Talk
Yi Sŏn-hŭi

Ch'ŏnmyŏng said her birthday was the first day of September, and she went to her older sister's place to celebrate it. On her birthday, I had planned to buy a wooden tray full of sticky rice cakes coated with mung bean and red bean powder, and noodles, carry it on my head to her house, and eat together, but she had already left, which was disappointing.
It's quite nice meeting Chŏng-hŭi every day in the same building, but since the two of us started meeting often, Yun-suk, who used to visit so frequently as if electricity sparked at the door, doesn't come often. Originally, Chŏng-hŭi and Yun-suk were particularly close, so I wonder if perhaps she is jealous of me.

Taking the Lowly People as a Subject
Han Sŏl-ya

Bravo! Mr. Sŏk In-hae.
Being always busy, it was only recently that I read Mr. Sŏk's “Panghwang” (彷徨) (in Chogwang magazine), and being greatly drawn more to the author's spirit than the story's amusement, I reread “Sanma” (山魔) (in Inmun P'yŏngnon), which I had previously stopped reading partway through. After reading the latter, I was further astonished by his talent and effort. Truly, at the point where the heart-wrenching sorrow of the lowly people (賤民), who can appeal neither to heaven nor earth, is depicted realistically, far too realistically, I wanted to have a good cry. Why have the critics left this marvel of our literary world unnoticed until now?

The Tip of the Bride's Pŏsŏn
Ch'ae Man-sik

Brother Sŏl-ya [Han Sŏl-ya], I am enjoying reading “T'ap” (塔) recently. In particular, at the passage where "Ugir-i" is playing while looking closely at the tip of the bride's *pŏsŏn* [traditional Korean sock], I slapped my knee unconsciously. It may be rude to say, but I had absolutely no idea that you, brother, were also capable of such delicate (뗄리케-트한) description.
Although I haven't read it, seeing the title of your travelogue, I gathered you had visited the Continent (大陸).<203>

**Summary**

This article compiles four short, informal pieces from prominent Korean writers of the era. Yi Hyo-sŏk explains his need for convalescence in the countryside (Chuŭl) and laments his lack of significant writing output for the year. Yi Sŏn-hŭi shares social observations about friends (Ch'ŏnmyŏng, Chŏng-hŭi, Yun-suk) and hints at potential jealousy arising from shifting friendships. Han Sŏl-ya passionately praises fellow writer Sŏk In-hae's works ("Panghwang," "Sanma") for their realistic portrayal of the suffering of the *ch'ŏnmin* (traditional outcast class), questioning why critics haven't recognized his talent. Ch'ae Man-sik compliments Han Sŏl-ya on his novel "T'ap," expressing surprise at his skill in delicate description, and notes Han's recent travels, likely to mainland Asia. From a historical perspective, the pieces offer glimpses into the personal lives, social circles, and literary discussions among intellectuals in late colonial Korea. The mention of health issues, travel (including possibly to Manchuria/China, referred to as "Continent"), literary praise focusing on social realism and the marginalized *ch'ŏnmin* class, and the casual use of early English loanwords ("building," "delicate") are points of interest for historians studying the period.

文人談話室
朱乙 가는 길에
李孝石

여름동안 별반 무리도 하지않고 過飮도 하 안엇 것만 웬일인지 건강이 부실해서 不可不 몇 달동안 싀골 가서 靜養하게 됐슴니다. 긴 여름 휴가가 막 끝난 끝에 또 놀기가 미안함니다민 하는 수 없이 두어 서너달 쉬이는 수밖에 없슴니다. 朱乙만한 곳이 없겠기에 또 그리로 가겠습니다. 今年은 이럭 저럭 츨츨한 作品을 못 쓰고 만 셈임니다. 그 대신 래년에나 좋은 것 내놓을까요.

餘談
李善熙

天命이가 9月초 하로ㅅ날이 生日이라고 하드니 生日 먹으러 자기 언늬에게로 갔다. 그의 생일날엔 내가 녹두 팟 고물을 무친 인절미와 국수를 한 목판 사서 이고 그의 집을 찾어가 함께 먹으려 했드니 그만 가고 말어서 섭섭했다.
같은 삘딍 속에서 貞熙와 每日 맛나니 썩 좋은데 우리 둘이 자조 맛나자 그처럼 문에 電氣가 펀찍일게 다니든 允淑이가 잘 오질 않는다. 워낙 정히와 윤숙은 별달니 친한 터이라 혹 나를 질투하는지로 모르겠다.

賤民을 題材로
韓雪野

燦! 石仁海君
늘 多忙한 關係로 요즘에야 石君의 『彷徨』(朝光)을 읽고 스토리의 자미보다 그 作家精神에 못내 끌리는 배 있어 그 전에 읽다가 만 『山魔』(人文評論)을 다시 읽어 보았다. 이 後者를 읽고 난 나는 더욱 氏의 天分과 努力에 놀랐다. 實로 하눌에도 땅에도 하소할 수 없는 賤民의 뼈저린 설음을 리알하게 너무도 리알하게 그려논 데는 한마당 痛哭이라도 하고 싶다. 어째 評論家들은 우리 文壇의 警異를 여태 그대로 내버려두고 있을가.

新婦의 버선코가
蔡萬植

雪野兄, 요새 「塔」을 재미있게 읽습니다. 그 中, 「우길이」가 新婦의 버선코를 들여다보면서 노는 대문에서는 不知中 무릎을, 쳤습니다. 실례될 말슴이지만 兄이 그대두룩 뗄리케-트한 描寫에도 能하섰던가는 깜박 몰랐었습니다.
읽지는 못했습니다마는, 紀行記의 題를 보고 大陸을 다녀오신 줄 알었습니다.＜203＞
