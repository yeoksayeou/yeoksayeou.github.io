Song for Sending Off Volunteer Soldiers
						Ch'unwŏn

1. On this day we send you off, shouting Manse!
The road you take as a soldier of the Emperor.
To protect our country, Japan,
You go as a Volunteer Soldier, receiving this awe-inspiring command.

2. How valiant and pure is your form!
How trustworthy and strong, like Mount T'aesan!
A brave soldier of the Imperial Army, born of my homeland,
What immense glory you offer to the Emperor!

3. Service on the home front (銃後奉公) is our duty now,
May you have loyalty (忠誠) and courage (용긔) wherever you go!
Go forth! Let us meet again on the day of your triumphant return (凱施)!
Gather around, gather around the Flag of the Rising Sun (日章旗), shout Manse! <217>

**Summary**

This poem, titled "Song for Sending Off Volunteer Soldiers," was written by Ch'unwŏn (Yi Kwangsu) and published in December 1940. It glorifies Korean men volunteering for the Japanese Imperial Army, portraying their departure as a noble act of loyalty to the Japanese Emperor and the Empire ("our country, Japan"). The poem emphasizes the soldiers' valiance, the glory they bring to the Emperor, and the duty of those remaining on the home front. It urges the soldiers onward with promises of a triumphant return, culminating in cheers of "Manse" for the Japanese flag. From a historical perspective, the poem is a stark example of pro-Japanese propaganda and collaboration during the late colonial period. It reflects the pressure and incentives used to mobilize Koreans for Japan's war effort under the "volunteer" soldier system, and illustrates how prominent figures like Yi Kwangsu participated in promoting imperial ideology.
