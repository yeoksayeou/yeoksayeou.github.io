**Commemorative Messages from Various Korean Social Organizations on the Occasion of the 4th Anniversary of the Holy War**

**A Congratulatory Message for the Fourth Anniversary of the Holy War**
*By the Korean Writers' Association (朝鮮文人協會)*

Looking back, the current great war, truly unprecedented in history, began with the single shot fired at Lukouch'iao (盧溝橋) on the night of July 7th, Shōwa 12 (1937). This Incident (事變), which started for the chastisement of arrogant China (支那), has now passed its fourth anniversary. During this time, our Imperial Army (皇軍), ever-victorious, has advanced through scorching heat and freezing cold, overcoming myriad difficulties and hardships, achieving brilliant war results admired worldwide. Furthermore, the spirit of the Hundred Million (一億) compatriots on the home front (銃後) has become increasingly resolute, and the wartime structure is steadily being perfected. This truly demonstrates the essence of our national polity (國體) and is a matter for profound congratulation for the Empire (皇國).

Last year, celebrating the 2600th year of the Empire's founding, the august spirit of the nation's founding was manifested, and the establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere (大東亞共榮圏) was declared domestically and internationally as our fundamental national policy. This is the very essence of Hakko Ichiu (八紘一宇), the great ideal of our Empire's founding. The day is not far when the construction of a new moral world order, centered on the Emperor (天皇), will be realized, radiating its light across the globe. In response to this grave situation, we, the twenty-three million people of the peninsula (半島), must further renew our determination as Imperial Subjects (皇國臣民), unite with one heart and one mind, and thoroughly practice the Way of Subjects (臣道), thereby perfectly fulfilling our duty to support the Emperor (翼賛). We pledge our utmost sincerity and effort.

**The Significance of the Fourth Anniversary of the Holy War**
*By the Korean Artists' Association (朝鮮美術家協會)*

Today, July 7th, marks the fourth anniversary of the outbreak of the Holy War (聖戰). Reflecting on these past four years, our Imperial Army (皇軍) has consistently achieved great victories, its military prestige resounding throughout the world. We are deeply moved and grateful.

Furthermore, with the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact among Japan, Germany, and Italy last autumn, followed by the recent conclusion of the Neutrality Pact between Japan and the Soviet Union, the establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere (大東亞共榮圏) centered on our Empire (皇國) is steadily progressing. This is truly a cause for immense joy for East Asia (東亞). We, the artists of Korea (朝鮮), recognizing the gravity of the current situation, pledge to further strengthen our resolve, follow the national policy, fulfill our duties in our respective fields, and strive with sincerity and devotion to serve the nation through art (美術報國).

**Facing the Fourth Anniversary of the Incident**
*By the Korean Federation of Film Producers, Directors, Technicians, and Actors (朝鮮映畫製作技術監督俳優總聯盟)*

The Holy War, aimed at constructing a new order in East Asia (東亞新秩序), has now entered its fifth year. The objective of this unprecedented great undertaking is to establish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere (大東亞共榮圏), a mission that grows heavier day by day. We, involved in the cultural front line of film, must deeply engrave the significance of this Incident (事變) in our hearts. We must eliminate any remnants of peacetime indulgence or dependence on Britain and America (英米) and, with renewed determination as Imperial Subjects (皇國臣民), unite across the nation (擧國一致) to push forward towards accomplishing the objectives of the Holy War.

Unfolding across the vast continent, the Holy War (聖戰) has now greeted its fourth anniversary. These four years have been a period of continuous brilliant victories for the Imperial Army (皇軍), overcoming all obstacles. Domestically, the spirit of the Hundred Million (一億) compatriots on the home front (銃後) has become ever more resolute, and the national structure to support the Emperor (翼賛體制) has been firmly established. This demonstrates the glory of our national polity (國體) shining throughout the world, a matter for boundless joy. At this crucial time, when the establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere (大東亞共榮圏) is being urgently pursued, we, the playwrights of Korea (朝鮮), pledge to further solidify our consciousness as Imperial Subjects (皇國臣民) and fulfill our duty to serve the nation through drama (演劇報國) with unwavering determination.

The Holy War (聖戰) has reached its fourth anniversary. Over these four years, the indomitable Imperial Army (皇軍) has advanced through China's (支那) vast lands, achieving glorious results day by day, their unparalleled loyalty moving us to tears. We are truly grateful for their hardships. The objective of this Holy War is the establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere (大東亞共榮圏). As Imperial Subjects (皇國臣民), we must unite with one heart, endure all difficulties, strengthen the home front (銃後), and exert every effort to achieve the goals of the Holy War.

*By the Keijō Chamber of Commerce and Industry (京城商工會議所)*

The China Incident (支那事變), which broke out on July 7th, Shōwa 12 (1937), has now reached its fourth anniversary. During this time, our Imperial Army (皇軍) has achieved unprecedented, brilliant war results worldwide, enhancing the Empire's prestige (國威) globally. We subjects (臣民) are filled with infinite emotion and gratitude. With the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact and the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Pact, the international situation surrounding our Empire (皇國) has become increasingly complex and grave. The great task of establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere (大東亞共榮圏) must be accomplished without fail. At this critical juncture, we, the business people on the peninsula (半島), must recognize the gravity of the situation. Under the national policy, we must further solidify our resolve as Imperial Subjects (皇國臣民), overcome all difficulties with endurance and perseverance (堪忍持久), strengthen the national total war footing (國家總力戰態勢), fulfill our duty of service to the public through our businesses (企業の公衆奉仕), and strive to perfect the economic structure for national defense (國防經濟體制), thereby contributing to the swift accomplishment of the objectives of the Holy War (聖戰). We sincerely pledge our commitment.

**Marking the Fourth Anniversary of the Holy War**
*By the Keijō Press Corps Association (京城記者俱樂部)*

Today marks the fourth anniversary of the start of the Holy War (聖戰). Over these four years, our Imperial Army (皇軍) has overcome innumerable difficulties, achieving brilliant victories and enhancing the Empire's prestige (國威) across the world. Words cannot express our gratitude. This Holy War aims to establish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere (大東亞共榮圏). Facing the current complex and grave international situation, the mission of the Empire (皇國) becomes ever more critical. We, the twenty-three million compatriots of Korea (朝鮮), must deeply recognize the gravity of the times, renew our awareness as Imperial Subjects (皇國臣民), unite with the mainland (內地) with unwavering loyalty (赤誠), strengthen the total war footing (總力戰態勢) on the home front (銃後), and fulfill our duty to support the Emperor (翼賛). We pledge to dedicate our utmost efforts.

**Summary**

This article compiles commemorative statements from various prominent Korean social, cultural, and economic organizations in July 1941, marking the fourth anniversary of the Second Sino-Japanese War (referred to as the "Holy War" or "China Incident"). The statements uniformly express gratitude for the sacrifices and successes of the Japanese Imperial Army, pledge unwavering loyalty to the Japanese Emperor and Empire, and vow to contribute to the war effort and the establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The organizations, ranging from writers and artists to business chambers and press clubs, emphasize the need for Koreans to fully embrace their roles as "Imperial Subjects" (Kōkoku Shinmin), eliminate any lingering liberalism or reliance on Western powers, and dedicate themselves to serving the nation through their respective fields (writing, art, film, music, drama, business, publishing, journalism).

From a historical perspective, this article is highly revealing as it showcases the extent of public pronouncements of loyalty and support for Japan's war effort by elite Korean organizations during the late colonial period. While the sincerity of these statements can be debated (often made under duress or coercion), they document the pervasive pressure and rhetoric of assimilation (Na선일체 - Naisen Ittai) and imperial subjecthood (皇國臣民化 - Kōkoku Shinminka) policies. Historians would find the uniformity of the language, the specific organizations involved, and the explicit endorsement of Japanese imperial ideology and war aims valuable for understanding the dynamics of collaboration, coercion, and propaganda in colonial Korea on the eve of the Pacific War.
