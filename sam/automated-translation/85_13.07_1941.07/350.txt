**Body Text Translation**
Home Front Literary Lecture Meeting

The Literary Home Front Lecture Meeting, hosted by the Literary Association (文藝協會) in Okaya City (岡谷市), Nagano Prefecture (長野縣), was held starting at 7 PM on the 9th of last month on the upper floor of the City Hall. The venue was a great success, with no standing room (立錐의 여지) even before the scheduled time.

Beginning with greetings from Mayor Imai of Okaya (今井岡谷市長), five individuals—Shinkyō Kaku (新居格), Nakamura Murao (中村武羅夫), Ibuse Masuji (井伏鱒二), Kamei Katsuichirō (龜井勝一郞), and Hibino Shirō (日比野士郞)—took turns delivering passionate speeches on literary service to the nation (文藝報國), deeply impressing the capacity crowd.

Before the lectures began, the group of speakers inspected Shirishio Pass (尻鹽峠). Starting from 5 PM, they attended a discussion meeting held at the City Hall with local influential figures and the heads of the cultural departments from each village and town's Yokusan Youth Corps (各町村翼贊壯年團文化部長). It is said that this became an informal meeting offering many suggestions for the construction of local culture. <177>

**Summary**

This news article reports on a "Home Front Literary Lecture Meeting" held in Okaya City, Nagano Prefecture, Japan, in June 1941. Hosted by the local Literary Association, the event featured five prominent Japanese literary figures who spoke about "literary service to the nation" to a large audience. Before the main event, the speakers visited a local pass and participated in a discussion with local leaders and cultural heads of the Yokusan Youth Corps regarding local cultural development. From a historical perspective, this piece is interesting as it appears in a Korean magazine, reporting matter-of-factly on an event in mainland Japan aimed at mobilizing cultural figures and local organizations for the Japanese war effort through literature. It demonstrates the reach of wartime propaganda and the integration of cultural activities into the state's objectives, highlighting the expected role of literature in bolstering the "home front" (銃後) spirit across the empire.
