**Summary**

[Since the main body text of the article is missing, the following summary is based solely on the title, author, date, and historical context.]
This article likely reports on statements made by Minami Jirō, the Governor-General of Korea, during a visit to Tokyo, as relayed by a correspondent named Ikeda Saburō. Published in July 1941, amidst the escalating Sino-Japanese War and the push for total mobilization, Minami's remarks probably emphasized the importance of the "Naisen Ittai" (Japan and Korea as One Body) policy, urging Koreans to demonstrate loyalty to the Japanese Emperor and contribute fully to the war effort as imperial subjects (皇國臣民). The article might have highlighted Korea's role in supporting Japan's war aims and portrayed Minami as confidently conveying the successful progress of assimilation policies in the colony to the leadership in Tokyo.

From a historical perspective, this article (if the text were available) would likely be significant as a piece of propaganda disseminated within Korea. It would illustrate how the colonial authorities presented the Governor-General's activities and statements made in the metropole (Japan) to the Korean populace, reinforcing the messages of assimilation, loyalty, and wartime duty. Historians could analyze the specific language used to gauge the emphasis placed on different aspects of colonial policy and wartime mobilization at this critical juncture.
