Fourth Anniversary of the China Incident, Let 100 Million Compatriots Engage in Self-Sacrifice for the Public Good
						Samch'ŏllisa

To overthrow the Chungking Regime and the Chiang faction, which obstruct the construction of a New Order in Asia (亞細亞) and adhere to the creed of accommodating communism and resisting Japan (容共抗日), the Empire dispatched the Imperial Army (皇師) to the 400-plus provinces [of China], and already five years [lit. stars and frosts] have passed; this July 7th marks the full fourth anniversary. During this time, the million-strong Imperial Army (皇軍) has truly fought valiantly and struggled hard, reaching the point where the vast majority of important land and sea areas within the entire map of China (全支那) have all been occupied by our army's hands. In parallel with this, by assisting the man of justice, Mr. Wang Ching-wei (汪精衛氏), along with fostering the New Government, the objectives of the Holy War (聖戰) have steadily been achieved. Now, facing this deeply moving day, we first sincerely mourn the spirits of the Imperial Army officers and soldiers sacrificed because of this Holy War, and at the same time, since the Incident is still ongoing, we, the citizens on the home front (銃後國民), know we must unite even more firmly, and with a spirit of self-sacrifice for the public good (滅私奉公), help the government and the military, praying that the harvest of this Holy War will become even more brilliant and swift.

**Summary**

This editorial from the Korean magazine Samch'ŏlli commemorates the fourth anniversary of the Second Sino-Japanese War (referred to as the "China Incident"). It praises the Japanese military's successes in China, justifies the war as a "Holy War" against the "pro-communist, anti-Japanese" Chungking government led by Chiang Kai-shek, and celebrates the establishment of the Wang Ching-wei collaborationist regime. The article strongly urges the Korean populace ("100 million compatriots," including Japanese) to unite, demonstrate loyalty through "self-sacrifice for the public good" (滅私奉公), and fully support the Japanese government and military to ensure a swift and glorious victory. For historians, this piece is a stark example of pro-Japanese propaganda disseminated in colonial Korea, showcasing the rhetoric used to mobilize Korean support for Japan's war effort and justify imperial expansion under the guise of creating a "New Order in Asia." The use of terms like "Holy War" and "Self-sacrifice for the public good" highlights the intense ideological pressure and assimilation policies faced by Koreans during this period.

支那事變四週年, 1億 同胞 滅私奉公하자
						삼천리사
亞細亞의 新秩序建設을 妨害하며 容共抗日을 信條로 하는 重慶政權 及 蔣一派를 打倒하기 爲하야 帝國이 皇師를 4百餘州에 進한지 이미 5個星霜, 이번 7月 7日로써 그 滿四週年記念日을 마지하게 되었다. 그 동안 百萬의 皇軍은 實로 善戰力鬪하야 이미 全支那의 版圖中 重要한 海陸의 大部分은 擧皆 我軍의 手에 占據함에 至하였으며 이와 幷行하야 正義의 士 汪精衛氏를 도와 新政府의 育成과 함께 聖戰의 目的은 着着 거두어 감에 至하였다. 이제 感慨 깊은 이 날을 當하매 吾人은 爲先 이 聖戰으로 말미아마 희생된 皇軍將兵의 英靈에 眞心으로 吊하며 그와 同時에, 아직도 事變은 繼續되고 있으니 我等 銃後國民은 더욱 더 一致團結하여써 滅私奉公의 精神으로 政府와 軍을 도와 이 聖戰의 거둠이 一層 빛나고 빠르기를 期하여야 할 바인줄 아노라.
