**Summary**

This article, titled "Memories of the War Front, On the Occasion of the Fourth Anniversary of the Holy War," was written by Yoshimura Kōdō (the Japanese name used by the Korean author Pak Yŏnghŭi) and published in the July 1941 issue of the magazine *Samch'ŏlli*. Although the full text is unavailable, the title and context suggest a reflective piece, likely a travelogue or memoir recounting experiences related to the ongoing Second Sino-Japanese War (referred to as the "Holy War"), timed for its fourth anniversary. From a historical perspective, the piece is significant as it features a prominent Korean intellectual writing under a Japanese name in a Korean magazine during the late colonial period, likely expressing sentiments aligned with the Japanese war effort, reflecting the complex pressures and collaborations of the time.
