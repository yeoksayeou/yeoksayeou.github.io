News of "Chŏng"
						No Ch'ŏnmyŏng

Because the gourd flower blooms at night is sorrowful
Because the night blooms is sorrowful—

Her mother's and father's blood murky,
That Woman,
From birth, sought an ominous star.
Her movements, deep-hued like the rugosa rose, so deep-hued,
She couldn't enter the fence (籬), looked to the sea, and was solitary <184>

Every time she drank Santory,
She cursed her faraway Lover (愛人),
And wept that she belonged neither to her mother's country nor her father's country.

Night after night, she was glamorous at evening parties (夜會).
There were white hands knocking on the blue Window (窓).

But they all flew away like phantoms.

Year after year,
Her red Youth (靑春) was squandered (蕩盡),
Only her mother's unfortunate Fate (運命) was inherited (相續).

—On the day I heard the news of "Chŏng's" death (訃音)—<185>

**Summary**

The poem tells the tragic story of a woman, referred to as "Chŏng" (possibly meaning 'stillness' or a name). Born of 'murky blood' (suggesting mixed heritage or social stigma), she felt alienated, unable to belong fully to either parent's 'country'. Despite a glamorous facade at nightly parties, she was deeply lonely, drinking and lamenting her fate. Her youth wasted away, seemingly inheriting only her mother's misfortune, culminating in her death. From a colonial history perspective, the poem offers a poignant glimpse into the potential struggles of identity and belonging, possibly hinting at the difficulties faced by mixed-heritage individuals or those marginalized within Korean society under Japanese rule. The themes of alienation, inherited misfortune, and societal barriers make it historically significant.

「靜」의 消息
						盧天命
박꼿은 밤에 피는게 설어워서
밤이 피는게 설어워서-

어매와 아배의 피가 흐려
그 女子는
나면서 不吉한 별을 찻다
몸짓이 海棠花처럼 지터서 지터서
울(籬)안엘 못들고 바다를 보며 孤獨했다<184>

산토리를 마시면 번번이
멀니 간 愛人을 욕하고
어매나라 사람도 아배나라 사람도 아니라고 울었다

밤이면 밤마다 夜會에서 華麗했다.
푸른 窓을 두다리는 힌 손길도 있었다

허나 그들은 다 잘샹처럼 날라가버렸다

그해도 그해도
붉은 靑春은 蕩盡되고
오직 어매의 不幸튼 運命이 相續되다

-「靜」의 訃音을 듯는 날-<185>
