The Truth of Important Facts in Various Social Spheres, Maeil Sinbo's New Lineup Welcomes President Kim Ch'ŏn, Senior Managing Director and Business Bureau Chief also Replaced

The Maeil Sinbo newspaper company, where Mr. Ch'oe Rin resigned and Mr. Kim Ch'ŏn newly became president, recently underwent many changes in its high-level personnel, drawing the attention of the press community. Mr. Ch'oe Rin was previously the leader of Ch'ŏndogyo, then assumed the position of Councilor in the Chūsuin (Central Council), and after that, became president of Maeil Sinbo, serving for about three years. During that time, Maeil Sinbo made leap after leap in progress; not only did its circulation drastically increase, but after the discontinuation of both the Tonga [Ilbo] and Chosŏn [Ilbo] newspapers, it performed many brilliant activities as the peninsula's sole vernacular (Hangul) paper. This time, upon assuming the position of Chūsuin Councilor again, he vacated the president's chair. His successor, Mr. Kim Ch'ŏn-sŏng (Yi Sŏng-gŭn),<70> was, until yesterday, serving as the Governor of Chungch'ŏngnam-do. Although this is his debut in the press world, it is expected that the skills and capabilities honed over many years in the official world will be fully demonstrated, transforming Maeil Sinbo into an even greater newspaper than it is today. Following the change of president, there was a reshuffle at the executive level. Mr. Fukae, who was formerly a Director (理事官) in the Sōtokufu (Government-General) Keimukyoku (Police Affairs Bureau) and became Senior Managing Director (專務 取締役), resigned. In his place, Police Inspector Kataoka, who was the Chief of the Police Affairs Section in the South P'yŏngan Provincial Police Department, was appointed. Also, Mr. Ueno, who was previously the Chief of the Police Affairs Section in the Kyŏnggi-do Provincial Police Department and then served as the General Affairs Bureau Chief at the Keijō Nippō (Kyŏngsŏng Ilbo), has joined the company again as a Director (取締役). The position of Business Bureau Chief was vacated by Mr. Yi Sang-ch'ŏl, and Managing Director (常務) Kim Pon-dong-jin is concurrently holding the post. Now, we introduce a passage from the new president's inaugural address:

"Under His Majesty's imperial authority (御稜威下), our Empire's national prestige is proclaimed throughout the four seas, and the holy undertaking of Raising Asia (興亞의 聖業) progresses day by day; this is a time when the people must further strengthen their will. However, the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere (大東亞共榮圈) is an unprecedentedly colossal task, and we cannot but anticipate many difficulties ahead in completing it. Therefore, we, the people, have no choice but to gather our total strength and courageously advance toward the establishment of a high-level national defense state system. Accordingly, we keenly feel that the duty of those in the profession of reporting and speech has also doubled. It is the mission of press organizations to unify national opinion, forge the 100 million citizens into a single fiery entity, and achieve the goal of completing the holy war (聖戰完遂), dedicating our utmost sincerity to serving the nation through reporting (報道報國) and serving the nation through speech (言論報國).

The Maeil Sinbo cooperates with the Sōtokufu's administration (總督政治) and strives with the 24 million imperial subjects (皇國臣民) to overcome the current difficulties. Now, as the situation becomes critical and the responsibility of the peninsula as a logistics base (兵站基地) becomes ever more grave and great, the mission of this newspaper, the peninsula's sole vernacular paper, has accordingly become heavier. Having ended my 35 years of life in the official world, I now stand on the front line of the press world.

The three principles 'Brightly (明), Righteously (正), Strongly (强)' are my lifelong beliefs. On this day I receive this heavy responsibility, I once again pledge to myself to firmly uphold these beliefs.

I hope for the support, guidance, and encouragement (指導鞭撻) of everyone in society (社會僉位), and offer these few clumsy words (蕪辭) as my inaugural address."<71>

**Summary**

The article reports on a major leadership change at the Maeil Sinbo newspaper in July 1941. Ch'oe Rin resigned as president to rejoin the Chūsuin (Central Council), and Kim Ch'ŏn-sŏng (Yi Sŏng-gŭn), former governor of Chungch'ŏngnam-do, took over. Other high-level positions, including the Senior Managing Director and Business Bureau Chief, were also filled with new personnel, some with backgrounds in the colonial police administration. The article includes excerpts from Kim Ch'ŏn-sŏng's inaugural address, emphasizing the Maeil Sinbo's role in supporting Japanese imperial rule, promoting the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, unifying national opinion for the "holy war," and serving the nation through reporting and speech as loyal imperial subjects. Historically, this article is significant as it details the staffing of the sole remaining Korean-language newspaper with individuals deeply integrated into the Japanese colonial administration, explicitly stating the newspaper's function as a propaganda tool for the Japanese empire and the war effort. The new president's speech, filled with Japanese imperial rhetoric ("御稜威," "興亞," "聖戰," "皇國臣民"), clearly illustrates the paper's role in mobilizing Korean support for Japan's wartime objectives and the suppression of any dissenting views.

社會各方面의 重要事實眞相, 金川社長을 迎한 每日新報 新陣營 專務, 營業局長도 更迭
崔麟씨가 辭任하고 새로 金川씨가 新社長이 된 每日新報社는 최근에 高級人事에 있어 많은 변동이 있어 언론사회의 주목을 끌었다. 崔麟씨는 앞서 天道敎의 領袖로 있다가 中樞院參議에 就任하였고, 그런뒤 다시 每新社長으로 就任하여 약 3個年 在職하였는데 그동안에 每新은 躍進에 躍進을 거듭하야 紙數의 激增은 물론, 東亞, 朝鮮 兩紙廢刊 뒤로는 半島의 唯一한 諺文紙로서 빛나는 활약을 많이 하여 오다가 이번에 다시 中樞院參議로 就任하면서 사장의 椅子를 내어놓은 터이며 後任인 金川聖(李聖根)씨는<70> 昨日까지 忠淸南道知事로 在職하든 분이라, 언론계는 비록 初出陣이나 多年 官界에서 練磨된 手腕과 力量은 遺憾없이 발휘하야 每新으로하여곰 今日 以上의 大新聞紙로 만들 것이 期待된다. 사장의 更迭에 따라 幹部級에 異動이 生하였으니 前總督府 警務局 理事官으로 있다가 專務 取締役이 된 福江씨는 사임하는 그 대신 平南 警察部 警務課長으로 있든 片岡警視가 취임하였고 또 앞서 京畿道 警察部 警務課長으로 있다가 京城日報 總務局長으로 있든 上野씨가 다시 取締役으로 入社하였으며 營業局長은 李相喆씨가 사임한 후 常務 金本東進씨가 兼務로 되어 있다. 이제 新社長의 就任辭의 一節을 紹介하면,
我帝國은 御稜威下에 國威四海에 宣揚되며 興亞의 聖業은 나날이 進捗되고 잇스니 此事 국민 一層 意를 强히 할바 올시다. 그러나 大東亞共榮圈의 건설은 曠古의 巨業이라 이를 完遂함에는 前途幾多의 困難이 있을 것을 豫想하지 않을 수 없습니다. 그럼으로 我等 國民은 總力을 集結하야 高度國防國家體制의 確立에 勇往邁進할 수박게 없습니다. 이에 따라서 報道와 言論의 職에 있는 者의 任務 또한 倍前加重되여 있음을 切實히 느끼는 바올시다. 報道報國 言論報國의 赤誠을 다하야 國論을 統一하며 一億국민을 熱火의 一團으로 만드러 聖戰完遂의 目的을 達成하는 것이 言論機關의 使命이올시다.
每日新報는 總督政治에 協贊하야 二千四百萬 皇國臣民으로부터 時難克服에 邁進하고 있습니다. 이제 時局은 緊迫하야 兵站基地 半島의 責務 또한 重且大한지라 半島 唯一의 諺文新聞인 本紙의 使命도 이에 따라 더욱 加重되고 있습니다. 不肖官界 35年의 生活을 끝내고 이제 言論界의 第一線에 서게 되었습니다.
밝게(明) 바르게(正) 굳세게(强)의 3個條는 不肖終生의 信條올시다. 이 重任을 拜受하는 날에 이 信條를 堅守할 것을 다시 한번 自誓하는 바 올시다.
社會僉位의 聲援과 指導鞭撻이 계시기를 바라면서 一言의 蕪辭로써 就任의 辭에 대하는 바올시다.<71>
