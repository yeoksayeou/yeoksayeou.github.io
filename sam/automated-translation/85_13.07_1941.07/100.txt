Author: 金東煥
Article Type: 시 (Poem)

Drunk on the rising fragrance of smoke,
Through the tobacco quarter (タンバクヤ), the old streets of Tongnae and Pusan I go.

In the blue-green flow of the Naktong,
The image of Tang warships from a thousand years ago appears.

This land is the site of Silla;
Remembering the image of the "Hwarang" (화랑), I am at the archery pavilion (射亭).

When spring comes, white willow tightly bound,
And red petals of peach and plum will float upon the stream. <58>

**Summary**

This short poem by Kim Tong-hwan, written in Japanese, describes impressions during a journey through southern Korea (Tongnae, Pusan, Naktong River area) en route to a lecture for a literary association. The poet reflects on the sensory experience of the old streets, the historical echoes of the Silla kingdom and Tang China seen in the landscape, the legacy of the Hwarang warriors, and imagines the beauty of spring. For historians, the poem is interesting as an example of a Korean intellectual writing in Japanese during the late colonial period (1941), focusing on landscape and history rather than overt political themes, possibly reflecting the constraints of censorship. The mention of the "Literary Association" hints at the organized cultural activities occurring under Japanese rule.
