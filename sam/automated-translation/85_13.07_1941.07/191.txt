Literature on Pathology and Treatment Explanation (Presented free of charge to those who apply by writing down the disease name and condition)

Acute and chronic nephritis (督廢炎), rehuro-je, cystitis (膀䏯炎), [prostate?] inflammation (■謨腺炎), slippery disease (滑病), diabetes (消渴), hematuria (血尿), bedwetting (寢小便), and genital diseases (生殖器病) are caused by factors such as common cold/flu (感胃), exposure to cold (冷込), fatigue (退勞), weakness from military service, unhealthy lifestyle (不攝生), or relationships with other illnesses and food, etc.; furthermore, invasion by E. coli (大腸菌) or tuberculosis bacillus (結核菌), and infection with gonorrhea toxin (淋毒) are extremely common.

Any of these are notoriously difficult diseases (難病), not easily cured, and they easily worsen again due to changes in [symptoms/condition?] (■■의 變化) and lack of proper care (不養生), readily causing dangerous complications (危險■發症). It is truly regrettable that conventionally, very many sufferers (羅患者) try various treatments (療法) one after another, ultimately finding no effect (效力) and suffering anguish (惱憫) unknown to others.

However, these diseases (本病) are by no means incurable (不治); because they are diseases that can be fully cured (곤칠 수 있는 病), one must achieve a fundamental cure (根本治療) with a correct treatment method (正確한 治療法), certainly without worsening the condition (病勢를 일으키지 않고).

The Jiryōdō Urinary Medicine Specialty Clinic (自療堂泌尿藥專門院) at Sannen-zaka West, Oka Park, Wakayama City (和歌山市岡公園西三年阪), which has researched urinary and venereal diseases and their self-treatment (自療法), has been repeatedly introduced in this magazine, and enjoys an extremely good reputation, has published Treatment Literature (療法文獻) (fixed price 35 sen (三十五錢)) for unfortunate chronic patients, explaining in great detail and kindness various symptoms (病狀), causes (原因), methods for health maintenance ([養?]生法), dietary regimens (食物養生法), special pharmacotherapies (特殊의 藥劑療法), etc., with the aim of providing relief for sufferers of difficult diseases (難病者救濟) while maintaining complete confidentiality (全部秘心). Please write urgently by letter, stating that you saw this in the April 1941 issue (三千里十六年四月號) for each disease and symptom.

Fortunately, there are indeed many testimonials of complete recovery (全快體狀) from those overjoyed that the difficult disease (難病) they suffered from for years (年來) was completely cured (完治) at home (自宅) and does not recur. We earnestly recommend (勸합니다) that everyone use this treatment method (療法) as quickly as possible (一刻이라도 速히). <108>

**Summary**

This text is an advertisement from a 1941 issue of the Korean magazine *Samch'ŏlli* for the Jiryōdō Urinary Medicine Specialty Clinic in Wakayama, Japan. It promotes a self-treatment method for various urinary and venereal diseases (including nephritis, cystitis, diabetes, gonorrhea, and general genital diseases), emphasizing secrecy and the possibility of an at-home cure. The ad offers free explanatory literature upon request (though later mentions a price for detailed literature) and encourages readers suffering from these often stigmatized conditions to contact the clinic, citing previous positive mentions in the magazine and testimonials of successful treatment. From a historical perspective, this advertisement highlights the cross-border nature of commerce and medical services (Japan-Korea) during the colonial period, the marketing of treatments for sensitive health issues suggesting social stigma, and the promotion of self-treatment potentially reflecting limitations in access to or trust in formal medical systems for certain conditions.
