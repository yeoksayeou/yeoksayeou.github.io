Recent Thoughts of Remarque, Author of "All Quiet on the Western Front"

What news is there recently of the author Remarque (Rumaruk'e), famous for his work "All Quiet on the Western Front"? Mr. Remarque, who recently appeared in Mexico (Meksik'o) in South America (Nami), shared various reflections with newspaper reporters. Setting aside his talk about war and his homeland for now, let's hear about his recent state of mind regarding his writing.

"I wrote 'Western Front' in 1929, a time when the horrors of the Great War were still clearly imprinted on the minds of people worldwide. It happened to resonate with that point, and the book became somewhat widely read in the world; it wasn't because I became a genius.

It was merely the trend of the times that made me famous; an author is, in part, governed by luck. As proof, when I was still unknown, I eagerly tried to sell my first work, going around everywhere, but in the end, nobody would buy it. However, after I became known for 'All Quiet on the Western Front,' a certain bookstore<176> happily bought that very same work, without changing a single character, for 2,000 dollars (10,000 Yen)."

"I have a hobby of collecting antiques (骨薰). Of course, since I have no money, I don't collect very valuable things, but among them, I have sought out items rich in the fragrance of culture. It seems like I might find something in Mexico, but I haven't yet. I also want to try visiting Japan (Ilbon). The flavor of Oriental (Tongyang) culture must be special, don't you think?"<177>

**Summary**

This article reports on recent comments made by Erich Maria Remarque, author of "All Quiet on the Western Front," during a visit to Mexico. Remarque reflects on his fame, attributing it largely to timing and luck rather than genius, citing how his first manuscript was only purchased after his famous novel succeeded. He also mentions his hobby of collecting antiques, focusing on cultural significance over monetary value, and expresses an interest in visiting Japan to experience "Oriental culture." From a historical perspective, the article is interesting as it presents the views of a renowned anti-war author in a Korean magazine published under Japanese colonial rule during the height of WWII militarism. His edited comments focusing on fame, writing, and culture, rather than war, and his expressed interest in Japan, might reflect censorship or an attempt to frame the internationally famous author in a way palatable to the authorities and the times.

「西部戰線 異狀업다」의 루마쿠케 近感
「西部戰線 異狀업다」의 著作으로 유명한 作家 루마루케의 그 뒤 소식은 어떠한가. 최근 南米 「멕시코」에 나타난 氏는 新聞記者에게 여러 가지 感懷를 말하였는데 戰爭과 祖國에 대한 이야기는 여기서 피하고, 그 외의 著作心境에 대한 근황을 듣건대
『西部戰線을 쓴 것은 1929年 임으로 大戰의 慘禍가 아직 世界사람의 머리에 뚜렸하게 박여있을 때인데 그것이 우연히 그 점에 부드친 바 있어 그 책이 좀 세상에 읽힌 것으로 내가 天才가 되어 그런 것은 아니다.
다만 당시의 潮流가 나로 하여금 유명하게 만들어 준 것뿐으로 作家라는 것은 한편 運에 의하여 지배되는 것이다. 그 증거로는 내가 아직 이름도 없었을 적에 第1回의 創作을 팔려고 躍起가 되어 돌아다녔으나 끗끗내 아무도 사주는 이가 없었는데 「西部戰線異狀업다」고 알려진 뒤에는 그것을 한 字도 고치지 않고 그대로 어떤 서점에서<176> 2천돌(萬圓)에 기쁘게 사주었다』
『나는 骨薰의 趣味를 가지고 있다. 물론 돈이 없음으로 그렇게 값가는 것은 모으지 못하나 그 중에는 文化의 香氣가 높은 것을 구하여왔다. 墨西哥에서는 무엔가 얻어줄 것 같으나 아직 없으며 日本에도 가보고 싶노라 東洋文化의 맛은 각별할걸요』<177>
