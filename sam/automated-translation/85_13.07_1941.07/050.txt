A refreshing breeze blows through the green leaves. We visited Mr. Masuda, the principal of Keijō Hōgaku Senmon Gakkō (Keijō Law College, hereafter Hōsen), known for his warm personality, at his official residence surrounded by quiet greenery in Shōtō-chō (淸濤町). Principal Masuda, who always greets visitors with a gentle smile, is truly like a compassionate father. As an educator standing at the forefront of the Peninsula's education sector, we asked him about various topics, primarily focusing on the thought trends of the Peninsula's youth.

**Reporter:** Thank you for seeing me today despite your busy schedule. The season of fresh greenery is truly pleasant, isn't it?

**Principal Masuda:** Indeed. Please, come in.

**Reporter:** Your residence is wonderfully quiet and feels very settled.

**Principal Masuda:** Well, it’s quiet, but perhaps a bit too inconvenient (laughs).

**Reporter:** Speaking of which, the entrance examinations for various schools were held recently. How were the results at Hōsen this year?

**Principal Masuda:** The competition ratio was roughly ten to one. While the number of applicants slightly decreased compared to last year, the quality of the students seems to have improved significantly. This year, there were quite a few outstanding individuals.

**Reporter:** That must be very encouraging for you as educators. What is the current ratio of Japanese to Korean students at Hōsen?

**Principal Masuda:** The ratio is approximately 6 Japanese to 4 Korean students.

**Reporter:** I see. There's a perception that students from the Peninsula tend to be somewhat speculative or lack perseverance compared to Japanese students. As someone who directly interacts with them, what are your thoughts, Principal?

**Principal Masuda:** Hmm, that's a difficult question. It's not easy to generalize, as personalities vary greatly among individuals. However, broadly speaking, one might say there's a tendency towards being somewhat logical or argumentative. Perhaps it's a characteristic of the ethnicity, but they often seem to prioritize theory over practice. While they might excel in abstract thinking, they can sometimes be lacking when it comes to practical application or steady effort. Of course, this is just a general observation, and there are many diligent and practical Korean students as well.

**Reporter:** Is there a difference in their academic performance or areas of interest?

**Principal Masuda:** In subjects requiring memorization or theoretical understanding, Korean students often perform exceptionally well. However, in subjects that require continuous practical training or experimentation, Japanese students sometimes show more perseverance. But again, this is not a strict rule. We see excellence across the board. What's more important is guiding them to cultivate a spirit of diligence and practicality, regardless of their background.

**Reporter:** Moving onto the main topic, the term "thought problem" (思想問題) is often discussed concerning the youth. What are your views on the current state of thought among the Peninsula's young people?

**Principal Masuda:** The "thought problem" is indeed crucial. In the past, there were certainly challenging periods influenced by various dangerous ideologies. However, especially since the outbreak of the China Incident (支那事變), there has been a remarkable shift. The awareness of being subjects of the Japanese Empire (皇國臣民) has significantly deepened among the youth. The spirit of *Naisen Ittai* (內鮮一體 - Japan-Korea Unity) and the understanding of our *kokutai* (國體 - national polity) have permeated considerably.

**Reporter:** So, you feel that the ideological guidance provided by educators and the government has been effective?

**Principal Masuda:** Yes, I believe so. The efforts in *kōminka* education (皇民化教育 - education to make Imperial subjects) have borne fruit. Students are increasingly understanding their role and responsibilities within the Empire. Activities like visiting shrines, participating in national ceremonies, and engaging in labor service have fostered a stronger sense of national identity and loyalty. Of course, we must not become complacent. Continuous guidance and education are essential to solidify these positive trends.

**Reporter:** Are there any specific concerns you still have regarding the students' thoughts or attitudes?

**Principal Masuda:** While the overall direction is positive, we must remain vigilant against any resurgence of harmful ideologies. Furthermore, it's important to cultivate not just ideological soundness but also a spirit of self-reliance, contribution to the nation, and practical skills. We need youth who can actively participate in building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere (大東亞共榮圈). Sometimes, there might be a tendency towards focusing too much on abstract ideals without grounding them in reality. Education must bridge this gap, fostering individuals who are both ideologically sound and practically capable.

**Reporter:** How do you see the role of schools like Hōsen in shaping the future leaders of the Peninsula?

**Principal Masuda:** Specialized schools (専門學校) like ours play a vital role. We are not just imparting legal or economic knowledge; we are cultivating individuals who understand the essence of the *kokutai* and can serve the nation faithfully. Our graduates will go on to various fields, and they must be equipped with both professional expertise and unwavering loyalty to the Empire. They are expected to be leaders who promote *Naisen Ittai* and contribute to the prosperity of the Empire and East Asia.

**Reporter:** Do you find that the students readily embrace this mission?

**Principal Masuda:** Generally, yes. The atmosphere has changed significantly. There's a growing enthusiasm for contributing to the nation's goals. The implementation of the Special Volunteer Soldier system (特別志願兵制度) also reflects this positive shift, with many young men eager to serve. This indicates a deeper understanding and acceptance of their duties as Imperial subjects.

**Reporter:** What aspects of education do you think need further strengthening?

**Principal Masuda:** We need to continuously emphasize practical education and character building. While academic knowledge is important, cultivating virtues like diligence, perseverance, filial piety, and loyalty is paramount. We must also strengthen physical training to build strong bodies alongside strong minds. The goal is to nurture well-rounded individuals fully committed to the Imperial cause. Education must be holistic, addressing spirit, mind, and body.

**Reporter:** Finally, do you have any message for the youth of the Peninsula?

**Principal Masuda:** I urge them to fully awaken to their position and responsibility as subjects of the glorious Japanese Empire. Study diligently, train your bodies, cultivate a noble spirit, and prepare yourselves to contribute significantly to the great task of establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Discard minor differences and unite wholeheartedly under the banner of *Naisen Ittai*. The future of the Peninsula and the Empire rests on your shoulders.

**Reporter:** Thank you very much for your valuable insights today. It has been most enlightening.

**Principal Masuda:** You are most welcome.

(The interview concluded in a cordial atmosphere, leaving a deep impression of Principal Masuda's dedication to education and his earnest hopes for the Peninsula's youth.)

**Summary**

This article is an interview with Masuda, the Japanese principal of Keijō Hōgaku Senmon Gakkō (Hōsen), conducted by a female reporter from the magazine *Samch'ŏlli* in 1941. Masuda discusses the characteristics of Korean students, noting a tendency towards theoretical thinking but sometimes lacking in practical application compared to Japanese students, while acknowledging individual variation. He observes a significant positive shift in the "thought" of Korean youth since the China Incident, attributing it to the success of *kōminka* (Imperial subjectification) education and a growing understanding of *Naisen Ittai* (Japan-Korea Unity) and the Japanese *kokutai* (national polity). He expresses optimism about their loyalty as Imperial subjects, citing enthusiasm for the Special Volunteer Soldier system, but stresses the need for continued guidance, practical education, and character building to foster individuals capable of contributing to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. For historians, the interview offers a direct view into the mindset of a high-ranking Japanese educator in colonial Korea, revealing the explicit goals of assimilationist education policy (*kōminka*), the perception and stereotyping of Korean students, and the emphasis on loyalty to the Japanese Empire and its wartime objectives (like the Co-Prosperity Sphere) as the primary aim of education during this period. Masuda's comments reflect the official ideology and propaganda efforts aimed at shaping Korean youth into loyal subjects.
