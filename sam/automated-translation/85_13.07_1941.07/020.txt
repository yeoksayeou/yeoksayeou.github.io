**Summary**

Based solely on the title, author, and publication date, this editorial by the Korean Writers' Association (朝鮮文人協會) marks the fourth anniversary of the "Holy War" (the Second Sino-Japanese War, initiated July 1937). Published in July 1941, amidst escalating conflict and tightening colonial control, the article is an appeal directed at Korean intellectuals. It almost certainly urges them to fully support Japan's war effort, framing it as a righteous "Holy War" and likely promoting unity within the Japanese Empire and the idea of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. For historians, this piece is significant as it exemplifies the mobilization of Korean cultural figures and organizations under Japanese colonial rule for propaganda purposes. It reflects the pressures on intellectuals to collaborate and publicly endorse Japan's imperial ambitions during wartime.
