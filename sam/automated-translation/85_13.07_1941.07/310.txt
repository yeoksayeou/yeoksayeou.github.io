It is said that the number of Chinese international students under the National Government of Nanjing (南京) studying abroad in Tokyo amounts to a large number, over 20,000, comprising only those in professional schools and universities. These international students reportedly held several grand welcoming receptions for Chairman Wang (汪主席), who is currently visiting Japan.<171>
