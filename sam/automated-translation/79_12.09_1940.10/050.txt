Critique of Figures like the New Governors, Review of the Recent High-Ranking Official Transfers in the Government-General and Each Province
						Matsuyama Rōkaku (松山浪客)

The Government-General carried out quite extensive personnel transfers on September 2nd. This is the largest personnel reshuffle under Governor-General Minami's administration since the transfers in May of Shōwa 11 (1936), near the end of Governor-General Ugaki's term. There were eight voluntary retirees: four Japanese and Korean governors, one director (Imperial appointment) of the Railway Bureau, two councillors (참여관) (one of whom was an Imperial appointment), and one director of a regional monopoly bureau. Additionally, transfers like that of Section Chief Murayama of the Tax Section to the Planning Agency were realized.

If one seeks the characteristics of this recent reshuffle, the promotion of newcomers and the strengthening of personnel exchange between the headquarters and regional offices can be cited, but these could be called principles of personnel transfers, so ultimately, they aren't particularly distinctive features. As it is an era lacking talent even in the official world, recently, promotions based on seniority, such as for high-ranking officials eligible for Imperial appointment (勅任昇進官), have become common practice. Thus, personnel changes of this degree offer nothing new. Until a new system (新體制) is established and broad personnel exchanges between government and civilian sectors are realized, it is difficult to expect a fresh atmosphere in the official world.

In this reshuffle, Mr. Ŏm Ch'ang-sŏp (嚴昌爕), Director of the Home Affairs Department of Hamgyŏngnam-do; Mr. Yi Ka Wŏn-bo (李家源甫), Section Chief of the Social Education Section at headquarters; Mr. Takao Jinzō (高尾甚造), Senior Administrative Official in the headquarters' Deliberation Office; and Mr. Kō Yasuhiko (高安彦), Chief of the Kyŏnggi-do Police Department <44> were newly promoted to governor positions; all were deserved promotions following the expected path. Mr. Ŏm Ch'ang-sŏp is from P'yŏngannam-do, and Mr. Yi Ka Wŏn-bo is from Hamgyŏngnam-do; both gentlemen have backgrounds as police officials. It goes without saying that they are figures from success stories (立志傳 中의 인물) who attained today's prestigious positions through diligent effort over 30 years as administrative bureaucrats. Governor Ŏm, with his imposing stature of 27 *kwan* (approx. 101 kg), possesses a very smooth and adaptable personality, though perhaps lacking somewhat in proactiveness, he is considered an uncontroversial figure. Having received the favor and friendship of Mr. Soeda (ꟲ田), the former head of the Office of the Yi Royal Family and current President of Keijō Imperial University, he achieved his current stature. With a background in Classical Chinese studies, he is a well-rounded individual expected to govern Chŏllanam-do, a province known for its troubles, capably without any particular missteps. On the other hand, Mr. Yi Ka Wŏn-bo has a personality opposite to Mr. Ŏm's; he is proactive and combative. His stern demeanor and attitude, seemingly indifferent to distinguishing between clean and dirty, suggest political qualities, making the governorship a better fit for him than a section chief position at headquarters. Since his time as Councillor (參與官) in P'yŏnganbuk-do, he has enjoyed the deep trust and favor of Director of Home Affairs Ōtake (大竹) (then Governor of P'yŏnganbuk-do). Particularly, with the backing of Hamgyŏng-do chaebol, <45> known for strong regional solidarity, he is expected to become a prominent figure not only in official circles but also later in the private sector. Messrs. Kō Yasuhiko (高安彦) and Takao Jinzō (高尾甚造) are from the so-called Taishō 11 (1922) cohort, marking their first promotions to governor. Mr. Kō's solemn and taciturn character and Mr. Takao's sharp personality are respectively anticipated to contribute significantly to the reform of provincial administration. In this reshuffle, Mr. Takao was transferred as the first Japanese (內地人) governor to Kangwŏn-do, a province where only Korean (半島人) governors had been appointed since the beginning of colonial administration. This might be a policy shift aimed at eliminating the detrimental practice of distinguishing between Japanese and Korean governors based on region in the future, but it needs to be implemented across all provinces, not just limited to Kangwŏn-do.

Among the section chiefs at headquarters, three—Yagyū (柳生) of the Local Affairs Section, Hosomi (細見) of the Land Improvement Section, and Kajikawa (梶川) of the Fisheries Section—were transferred out as Directors of Home Affairs Departments, thereby somewhat strengthening the previously rather weak lineup of Home Affairs Department Directors.
Originally, there was criticism regarding the poverty of talent in regional offices due to the headquarters excessively concentrating talent in the center and slighting the provinces. Therefore, paying attention to this aspect in the current reshuffle can be seen as progressive. Furthermore, the appointment of individuals like Kye Kwang-sun (桂珖淳) and Okamura Shun (岡村峻) as section chiefs at headquarters, and the appointment of figures like Mori Hiroshi (森浩) and Yamamura Jinsaku (山村仁策) as Police Department Chiefs, represent the promotion of the Shōwa 6 (1931) cohort, marking the emergence of talented young officials into key middle-ranking roles. Particularly, Kye Kwang-sun's appointment as Section Chief of Social Education is the most significant promotion in this reshuffle. Previously, this position, like the Councillor (參與官) role within the Government-General, was considered one reserved for specially promoted individuals in their 40s or 50s. However, appointing Mr. Kye, a qualified young Korean official aged 32 this year, truly reflects the keen insight (炯眼) of the headquarters authorities, and it feels like a pending issue has been resolved. <46> Also, appointing Councillors (參與官) from the Director-level official (道이사관) rank rather than the County Magistrate (군수) rank is another distinctive feature of this personnel reform. The current Councillor system differs from that of the past; nowadays, it is similar to a Provincial Administrative Official (道사무관). In the past, Councillor was both an official rank and a job title, merely an idle post (閑職). However, now Councillor has become a functional job title, with the official rank aspect remaining only as an institutional residue (制度상의 殘滓). With the establishment of Industry Departments in each province, Councillors are appointed as Directors of Home Affairs or Industry Departments. Thus, appointing numerous individuals from the County Magistrate level, as was done during the era of idle posts, is unsuitable. Of course, this is a principle, not an absolute rule. It is natural, even from the perspective of reforming the civil service system, that outstanding talents should be recruited from the County Magistrate level as well. However, given the increasingly complex wartime economy since the Incident (事變, referring to the Second Sino-Japanese War), the position of the Provincial Industry Department Director, which has become akin to the chief of staff for each province's wartime economy, cannot be viewed as it was before. In other words, now that the status of the Councillor has undergone a qualitative change, the headquarters' decisive move to primarily recruit talent from the Director-level official rank is commendable. Especially, the bold appointment of Mr. Hong Yŏng-sŏn (洪永善) (who was P'yŏnganbuk-do's Ch'angsŏng County Magistrate at the time of his transfer) directly to Director of the Chŏllanam-do Industry Department after his transfer from Manchuria (滿洲) is seen as offering great hope (曙光) to Korean officials who will be transferred to Manchuria, reinforcing the Korea-Manchuria personnel exchange policy. This is noteworthy as an embodiment of Governor-General Minami's "Korea and Manchuria as One" (鮮滿一如) policy.

Finally, to add a word to this review of transfers, we request the authorities to increase the positions for Koreans (半島人) within possible limits whenever there is a major reshuffle. Instead of carrying out forced transfers in an era of personnel scarcity, gradually increasing the number of high-ranking Korean officials, regardless of province or official position distinctions, would be one strategy for strengthening "Japan-Korea Unity" (內鮮一體). We hope the authorities will give special consideration to this point in the future.

**Summary**

This 1940 article from *Samch'ŏlli* magazine critiques recent high-level personnel changes within the Japanese Government-General of Korea and provincial administrations. While noting the promotion of several figures, including two Koreans (Ŏm Ch'ang-sŏp and Yi Ka Wŏn-bo) to governorships and the notable appointment of a young Korean (Kye Kwang-sun) to a section chief position, the author argues the reshuffle lacks novelty and merely follows seniority. The author praises the increased exchange between central and regional offices and the elevation of the Councillor (Ch'amyogwan) role's requirements. The article concludes with a call for the authorities to progressively increase the number of high-ranking positions held by Koreans to strengthen the policy of "Naeseon Ilche" (Japan-Korea Unity). For historians, this piece offers valuable insights into the workings of colonial bureaucracy, the criteria for promotion (including background, connections, and perceived loyalty/competence), the implementation of assimilationist policies like Naeseon Ilche through personnel management, and a contemporary Korean perspective (albeit likely vetted) on these developments, including the subtle advocacy for greater Korean representation within the colonial power structure.

新知事 등 人物評, 今次의 總督府 及 各道 高官 異動評
						松山浪客
총독부에서는 9월 2일에 상당히 광범한 인사이동을 단행하였다. 宇垣총독 말기인 昭和 11년(1936년) 5월 이동이래 南총독 치하에서는 최대의 인사이동이다. 內鮮知事 4명 철도국이사(勅任) 참여관 2명 (其中 1명은 勅任) 지방 전매국장 1명 합8명의 勇退者가 있었으며 村山세무과장의 기획원 전근 등이 실현하였다.
今般 이동의 특색을 찾으려면 신진의 발탁과 본부와 지방청과의 인사교류의 강화 등을 擧할 수 있으나 이것은 인사이동의 원칙이라 하겠으니 결국 특색이라 할 것도 못된다. 官界에도 인재 缺乏時代이니 만치 최근에는 특히 고참급의 勅任昇進官 등 順에 의한 榮進이 常事이니 이런 정도의 관계인사로서는 新味는 아무 것도 없다. 新體制가 확립되여 관민간의 광범한 인사교류가 실현되기 전에는 官界에 淸新한 맛을 주문하기는 곤란하다.
이번 이동에 咸南 내무부장 嚴昌爕, 본부 사회교육과장 李家源甫, 본부 심의실수석사무관 高尾甚造, 경기도 경찰부장 高安彦 <44> 4氏가 새로 지사에 榮進하였는데 모다 당연한 順路에 의한 榮轉이다. 嚴昌燮씨는 平南 출생 李家源甫씨는 咸南 출생으로 兩氏가 모다 경관 출신이다. 30여년간 刻苦勉勵, 행정吏僚로 입신하여 금일의 榮位을 획득한 立志傳 中의 인물임은 물론이다. 嚴知事는 27貫의 거구로 풍모 당당한데 성품은 극히 圓轉滑脫하여 다소 소극적인 감은 不無하나 무난한 인물이다. 前李王職 장관이며 現城大 총장인 ꟲ田씨의 寵愛知友를 받어 금일의 大를 일우었는데 漢學이 소양도 있어 원만한 인격자로서 말성 많은 全南의 道伯으로서는 하등 실책없이 善政을 施할 것으로 기대된다. 일방 李家源甫씨는 嚴씨와 반대적 성격으로 적극적이며 전투적이다. 其 근엄한 풍모 청탁을 가리지 않는 듯 하는 태도 등 정치가적 소질이 있는 이만치 本府 과장보다는 지사가 최적임이다. 平北 參與官이래 大竹내무국장(당시 平北지사)의 知遇를 받어 신임이 후하다. 특히 지방적 단결력이 강하다고 볼 수 있는 咸鏡道 재벌을<45> 배경으로 관계에서는 물론,  후일 민간에서도 뚜렷한 존재가 될 것으로 촉망된다. 高安彦, 高尾甚造 兩氏는 소위 大正11년(1922년)組로서 최초의 知事 榮進이다. 高씨의 重厚黙重한 성격, 高尾씨의 예민한 성격은 各其 道政 刷新上 기대되는 바 크다. 今般 이동에 始政이래 半島人 知事만 두던 江原道에 高尾씨가 최초의 內地人 知事로 轉任하였는데 이것은 금후 地에따라 內鮮人 知事의 구별을 하는 弊를 없애려는 정책의 전환이겠으나 江原道에 限할 것 없이 全道에 亙하여 단행할 필요가 잇을 것이다.
本府 과장 중에서 柳生地方, 細見土地收良, 梶川수산 3과장이 내무부장으로 전출하였는데 이에 따라 종래 너무 빈약하던 내무부장 陳容이 다소 강화되었다.
원래 本府에서 너무 중앙에 인재를 모아드리어 지방을 輕視하는 感이 있어 지방청의 인물의 빈곤에 대한 비난이 있었더니만치 今般 이동에 있어 이에 着目한 것은 진보적이라 하겠다. 또 桂珖淳, 岡村峻씨 등의 本府 과장 등용, 森浩, 山村仁策씨 등등의 警察部長 기용은 昭和6년(1931년)組의 발탁으로 신진 기예의 俊秀들이 중견 役으로 등장한 셈이다. 특히 桂珖淳씨의 사회교육과장 기용은 今般 이동에서는 최대의 발탁이다. 종래 이 의자는 총독부內 參與官과 마찬가지로 看做되여 4, 50대의 特進組를 앉치워 왔으나 이번에 비로소 半島人 유자격자인 당년 32才의 청년관리 桂씨를 기용한 것은 확실히 本府 당국자의 炯眼이라 하겠으며 현안이 해결된 感이 있다.<46> 또 參與官의 기용을 군수급에서 취하지 않고 道 이사관급에서 취한 것도 인사쇄신의 一特色이다. 현재 參與官制度는 昔日의 그것과 달러 現今은 道사무관과 마찬가지다. 과거에는 參與官은 官名인 동시에 職名으로서의 一閑職에 불과하였지만 現今은 參與官은 職名化하여 官名으로서는 제도상의 殘滓밖에 남지 아니하였다. 이것은 各道의 산업부 설치에 따러 參與官을 내무부장이나 산업부장에 임명케 되었으니 閑職시대 同樣 군수급에서 多數 기용하는 것은 不適하다. 물론 이것은 원칙이지 절대적은 아니다. 군수급에서도 우수한 인재를 起하여야 할 것은 관리제도 개혁론으로 보아도 당연하겠지만 事變이래 복잡 다단하여 가는 戰時경제의 各道 참모부장화한 道산업부장의 지위를 종전과 같이 볼 수는 없다. 즉 참여관의 지위에 질적 변화가 생긴 今日 주로 道이사관급에서 인재를 기용한 것은 本府의 영단이라 하겠으며 특히 滿洲로 전출하였던 洪永善씨(전출당시는 平北 昌城군수)를 일약 全南산업부장에 발탁한 것은 鮮滿 인사교류정책의 강화 상 滿洲로 전출할 半島관리에게 큰 曙光이라 할 것으로 南총독의 鮮滿一如정책을 구현화한 것으로 주목된다.
최후로 이동評에 加言할 것은 大이동이 잇을 때마다 가능한 범위 내에서 半島人의 의자를 증가시키어 주기를 당국에 요망한다. 인재빈곤시대에 무리한 이동을 하지 말고 道의 구별과 관직의 구별 없이 점차 半島人 高等官의 수를 증가시키는 것도 內鮮一體의 강화상 一方策이 될 것이니 금후 이점에 당국자는 특히 고려함을 요망하는 바이다.
