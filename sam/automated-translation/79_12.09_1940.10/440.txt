West Wind
						Yi Yuksa
Bearing a frosty hue,
It came from the endlessly blue sky.

Lying spread on the riverbed,
Then brushing past the white tops of the reed flowers.<204>

Hiding in the great scabbard of a mighty warrior,
It also blows upon the mast of a traveler returning home.

On the day it paled the young widow's cheek,
It changed the sound of insects in the bamboo grove.

Shaking regret like the leaves of an aspen,
When you come, it feels ominous, yet I like it.<205>

**Summary**

This poem by Yi Yuksa personifies the "West Wind" as a powerful, pervasive force arriving with the chill of autumn ("frosty hue"). It describes the wind's journey across landscapes (riverbed, reeds) and its interaction with human elements (warrior's scabbard, returning traveler's mast, widow's cheek), altering nature's sounds (insect chirps). The poem concludes with an ambivalent feeling towards the wind – it shakes "regret like aspen leaves" and feels "ominous," yet the speaker paradoxically welcomes its arrival ("I like it"). From a historical perspective, Yi Yuksa was a prominent anti-Japanese independence activist and poet. Written during the late colonial period (1940), the poem's depiction of the west wind—a force that brings change, chills, and evokes regret yet is strangely welcomed despite its ominous feel—could be interpreted allegorically. Historians might find interest in this complex emotional landscape, potentially reflecting the grim realities and perhaps a paradoxical longing for radical change, even if destructive, under oppressive colonial rule.

西風
						李陸史
서리 빛을 함복 띄고
하늘 끝없이 푸른데서 왔다.

江바닥에 깔여 있다가
갈대꽃 하얀우를 스처서.<204>

壯士의 큰칼집에 숨여서는
귀향가는 손의 돋대도 불어주고.

젊은 과부의 뺨도 히든 날
대밭에 벌레소릴 갓구어놋코.

悔恨을 사시나무 잎처럼 흔드는
네오면 不吉할것같어 좋와라.<205>
<204-205>
