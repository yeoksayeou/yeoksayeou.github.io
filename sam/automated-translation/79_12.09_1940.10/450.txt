A Short Song from a Sickbed
						Mo Yun-suk

My house is in a secluded place
No one passes by
Inside a tiny thatched hut
My room surrounded by earthen walls

At night, the moonlight visits
The passing wind pauses briefly
But no one passes by my door

The scent of night grapes from the farm
Circles the mountain path and seeps through the window frame
The cry of a night bird from a far-off mountain<206>
Faintly leaves summer behind

Though there's no reason (理) you would come
That face, tinged by the moonlight
Blooms like happiness
On the path through the thin woods.

Though there's no reason (理) you would pass
By my poor house
On the wall of my empty heart
There is your hand
Engraving sorrow

Though I try not to see
Though I try to forget
Visible once more
Thought of once more
My Ideal!
Your image!<207>

**Summary**

This poem by Mo Yun-suk, titled "A Short Song from a Sickbed," depicts the profound loneliness and yearning of a speaker confined to a simple, isolated dwelling. Nature—moonlight, wind, the scent of grapes, bird songs—provides fleeting companionship, but the absence of human visitors, particularly a beloved "you," dominates the speaker's thoughts. Despite acknowledging the unlikelihood of the beloved's arrival, their idealized image persists, bringing both a sense of happiness and sorrow, deeply engraved on the speaker's heart. From a historical perspective, the poem offers a glimpse into personal sentiment during the late colonial period. While not overtly political, its themes of isolation, poverty, longing, and clinging to an ideal could resonate with the broader context of hardship and suppressed aspirations under Japanese rule. Historians might find Mo Yun-suk's focus on intense personal emotion and idealism noteworthy, especially considering her later prominence and political evolution in post-liberation Korea.

病床小曲
						毛允淑
내집은 외진 곧
지나는이 없습니다
조고만 초막안에
흙벽으로 둘러싼 나의방

밤이면 달빛이 날나들고
지나는 바람이 잠시 머므를뿐
아무도 내문앞을 지나는이없습니다

農園에서 오는 밤포도 내음새가
山길을 돌아 문창에 숨여들고
머-ㄴ山에서 우는 밤새소리가<206>
히미하게 여름을 남겨줍니다

당신이야 오실理 없지만
달빛에 물든 그얼굴이
여윈 숲풀길에
幸福처럼 피어 올름니다.

가난한 내집앞을
당신이야 지날理 없지만
븨-ㄴ 가슴벽엔
슬픔을 아로삭이는
당신의 손 길이 있음니다

안보랴해도
잊으려해도
다시금 또 보이는
다시금 또 생각키는
나의 理想!
그대의 모습!<207>
<206-207>
