Ebbing Water (and 1 other)
						An Sŏ

Ebbing Water

When the ebb tide (쎌물) of the West Sea (西海) carries my love away,
This heart of mine is sorrowful; if I were a seagull,
Following the boat, I would go across the sea.
Sorrowful from parting, I cannot live at the port (浦口까).

Oh water, swirling as if the wide sea were narrow,
Your path is my enemy; if not for you,
My love who came seeking the time would not leave.
Distant is the open sea, like my heart that lost my love.<84>

Homesickness (思鄕)

At the edge of the eaves where swallows tumble acrobatically,
The gentle May sunlight shines beautifully,
And when an airplane comes crying through the empty sky,
Looking up crying, the sky is that of my old hometown,

How is my beloved hometown now?
In the clear sky, green mountains, and blue sea,
On the mountains, leaves turn in the wind,
At the port (浦口까), boat songs play with the waves.

In a tiny valley, in a green pine grove (솔밧),
If you climb the back mountain, the sea is endless,<84>
Wide fields lie blue-green before and behind,
And beside them, a clear river enters the sea.

This summer too, mother must be raising silkworms,
Her aged body likely has no day of rest,
How might my younger sibling, left alone, be getting by?
Are they weeding the tea field (茶田)? There's no way to know.

Like my younger sibling who married out that same year,
Like a drifting bird, I left home,
Thinking back, it's fast, already six years,
Only thoughts come and go, there is no way to go.

Looking back, May drowses wearily
On the brick house roofs of the Seoul streets,
Automobiles sigh amidst the dust,
Only noisy sounds, no place to rest my heart. <85>
<84-85>

**Summary**

The document presents two poems by "An Sŏ" (岸曙). The first, "Ebbing Water," expresses sorrow over separation as a loved one departs by sea, blaming the tide for the parting. The second, "Homesickness," contrasts nostalgic memories of a vibrant, natural hometown (clear skies, green mountains, sea, family activities like silkworm raising) with the speaker's current lonely and noisy life in Seoul after six years away. The speaker longs for home but feels trapped in the city. From a historical perspective, the poems reflect the emotional toll of migration and displacement, common experiences during the colonial period as people moved from rural areas to cities like Seoul, often for economic reasons or education. The stark contrast between the idealized hometown and the alienating city, coupled with the sense of powerlessness ("갈 길은 업네" - no way to go), offers insight into the psychological landscape of Koreans navigating modernization and colonial realities. Historians might find the depiction of urban alienation versus rural nostalgia, and the mention of specific details like airplanes and automobiles in Seoul alongside traditional activities like silkworm raising, valuable for understanding social change and sentiment in 1930s Korea.

						岸曙
드나는 물

西海 바다 쎌물이 님 실고 갈 제
이 내 맘 설을네라 갈매기라면
배딸아 난 바다를 내가 가려니.
離別 설어 浦口까 나 못 살겟네.

넓은 바다 좁다고 휘도는 물아
네 길이 원수로다 너 곳 아니면
때를 차자 들온 님 안 떠나련만.
아득타 난바다도 님 일흔 心思<84>

思鄕

제비의 재조 넘는 지차귀 끗에
가벼운 五月 볏이 고이 빗나고
虛空을 飛行機가 울며들올 제
울어르니 하늘은 옛날 故鄕의,

그립은 내 故鄕은 只今 엇덜고.
맑은 하늘 프른 山 프른 바다의
山에는 풀입사귀 바람에 돌고
浦口까엔 뱃노래 물결과 놀리.

조고마한 골작이 프른 솔밧의
뒷山에 올나서면 바다 끗 업고<84>
넓은 들은 팔핫케 압뒤에 눕고
그겻엔 맑은 江이 바다로 드네.

이 여름도 어머니 누에치노라
늙으신 몸 便할 날 바이 업스리,
홀로 남은 同生은 어이 지낼가,
茶田을 맬 것인가, 알 길이 업네.

싀집사리 뉘 同生 가튼 그해에
뜬새가치 이 몸은 집 떠낫거니,
생각하면 빨으다. 발서 여섯 해,
오락가락 心思뿐, 갈 길은 업네

돌아보니, 五月은 서울 거리의
벽돌집 지붕 우에 勞困히 졸고
自動車는 몬지 속 한숨을 쉬네,
요란스런 소리뿐, 맘둘 곳 업네. <85>
