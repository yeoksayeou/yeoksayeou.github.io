Four Famous Anecdotes

If you ask Mr. Yi Kwangsu the circulation numbers of the Tonga Ilbo, he invariably turns his head and says,
"I don't know. Because if one knows the newspaper's circulation, one cannot help but answer when others ask, so I make it a point not to know from the outset."
For Mr. Yi, who serves as the Chief Editor, not knowing his own newspaper's circulation might seem like a bolt from the blue, but it is an excellent, famous retort to shut the mouths of certain Koreans who casually ask vulgar questions like "How much is your salary?" or "How many copies are published?"

When Mr. Kwŏn Tŏkkyu published a refreshing piece titled "A Blow to the Heads of the Disguised" (假明人頭上에 一棒) in the Tonga Ilbo, Confucian scholars (儒林) from the Yŏngnam region, calling him a disturber of Confucian ways (斯文亂賊), flocked to Seoul (上京). Consequently, several dozen men in traditional robes (道袍) went to the Tonga Ilbo for a major debate. The one who stepped forward to receive them was Mr. Pak Ilbyŏng.
"Hey! You Tonga Ilbo fellows! What do you mean by 'decadent Confucians' (腐儒)? We are the holy disciples of Confucius!"
Mr. Pak, after explaining the meaning of 'decadent Confucian' (腐儒) with ** eloquence, asked,
"So, are you saying you are decadent Confucians like this?"
The men in robes had nothing more to say and turned back, defeated.

During a period of considerable turmoil at the Chosŏn Ilbo, I met Mr. Yi Yŏsŏng, a heavyweight at the company, on the street.
"Well, it seems things inside and outside the company have been extremely tense lately."
"My good man, how would an immortal (神仙) know of such things? Such matters of the secular world (俗界)... I know nothing. Nothing at all,"
he replied, posing as an immortal, smiling inscrutably yet remaining serene, and turned away.

On the day Mr. Yun Iksŏn first established a **library (圖書舘, assumed based on context) at Ch'wiunjŏng Pavilion and held its opening ceremony, perhaps intending to solicit some donations from the well-to-do, he invited and seated almost all the wealthy elders (富老) of the capital (長安), starting with aristocrats (貴族) like Yi Wanyong and Song Pyŏngjun. During the guest congratulatory speeches, Mr. Kim Ch'angje stood at the podium, glanced repeatedly at the aristocrats' seating area, and said,
"If you are a Duke (公爵), don't just try to show off your tail feathers like a peacock (孔雀). If you are a Marquis (侯爵), don't just mimic others like a monkey (원숭이) (because the character for Marquis, 侯, sounds like the word for monkey, 猴)..."
In this manner, he delivered countless rebukes and criticisms to the Counts (伯爵), Viscounts (子爵), and Barons (男爵) as well. It must have been the first time the aristocratic lords were so insulted in front of a large audience.<48>

**Summary**

This article presents four short anecdotes featuring witty retorts or notable encounters involving prominent Korean figures in 1931: Yi Kwangsu cleverly avoids stating his newspaper's circulation, Pak Ilbyŏng deftly handles protesting Confucian scholars, Yi Yŏsŏng humorously feigns ignorance about his newspaper's troubles by calling himself an immortal, and Kim Ch'angje publicly mocks the Japanese-ennobled Korean aristocracy at an opening ceremony using puns based on their titles. These vignettes offer glimpses into the social and intellectual atmosphere of colonial Seoul, particularly the interactions between journalists, traditional scholars, and the compromised elite. For historians, the piece highlights the tensions between modernizing journalists and traditionalists, the internal politics of newspaper companies, and especially the open disdain expressed towards the Korean aristocracy collaborating with or benefiting from Japanese rule, showcasing a form of passive resistance and social commentary within the constraints of the era.

名談四句
李光洙氏에게 東亞日報의 發行部數를 무르면 반드시
「나는 모름니다. 원체 新聞部數란 아러두면 남이 무를 때 對答아니 할 수 업기에 나는 애당초부터 모르고 지냄니다」
라고 머리를 돌닌다. 編輯局長으로 잇는 氏가 제 新聞의 發行部數를 모르다니 청천하늘에 벼락불 떠러질 일이지마는 「月給을 얼마나 밧소」나 「몟部나 發行되오」하는 野卑한 質問을 예사로히 하는 一部 조선사람의 입을 트러맛기에 絶好한 名對答이다.

權悳奎氏가 「假明人頭上에 一棒」이란 痛快한 一文을 東亞日報에 내자 嶺南儒林들이 斯文亂賊이라고 떼를 지어 上京하엿다. 그래서 結局 道袍자락들이 數十名이나 크게 論難할 次로 東亞日報로 갓다. 그때 그네들을 應待하기로 나선 이는 朴一秉氏라.
「이놈! 東亞日報놈들아 腐儒라니 웬말이냐. 孔夫子의 聖學徒를.」
朴氏는 腐儒의 뜻을 ** 雄辯으로 說示한 뒤
「그래 당신들이 이러케 腐儒란 말이오?」
道袍자락은 더할말이 업서 도라 右便하엿다.

朝鮮日報의 한참 騷亂통에 그社 重鎭 李如星氏를 길가에서 맛낫다.
「그래, 요지간 社의 內外가 大端히 緊張한 모양이드군요.」
「이보요 神仙이 엇지 그런 일을 아오. 그런 俗界의 일을... 나는 아모것도 모르오. 모르요」
하고 神仙自處로 笑面不審心自閑하고 도라서 버린다.

尹益善氏가 醉雲亭에 **舘을 처음 創設하고 그 開舘式을 擧行하든 날 돈푼 잇는 사람들에게서 義捐을 좀 밧어볼 궁리엇든지 李完用일다 宋秉畯일다하는 貴族을 爲始하야 長安에 돈푼잇는 富老들은 擧皆招請하야 列席식혓다. 來賓祝辭에 드러가 金昶濟氏가 演壇에 서더니 貴族席을 슬금슬금 처다보며.
「公爵」이거든 「孔雀」가치 꼬리치레만 하려고 마러라. 「侯爵」이거든 「원숭이」모양으로(원숭이猴字니까) 남의 숭내만 내지말아 또... 」
이 모양으로 伯爵, 子爵, 男爵까지 無數한 꾸지람과 핀잔을 주엇다. 萬人坐中에서 아마 貴族大監들이 辱보기는 처음이엇슬걸.<48>
