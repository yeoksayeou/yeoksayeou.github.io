**Body Text Translation:**
The Far East Situation and Compatriots in Manchuria, Tianjin, Inside the Pass
The Cause of the Oppression of Compatriots

It is an undeniable fact that in the last 4-5 years, the tendency of Chinese officials to oppress the hundreds of thousands of Korean farmers, who sought mere survival in Manchuria and turned barren wasteland into fertile paddies and stony ground into fertile fields, has become conspicuous. I take up this pen thinking it is not meaningless to investigate one aspect of the oppression of our compatriots at a time when feelings between the Korean and Chinese peoples have become sharp due to incidents like the Wanpaoshan Incident and the P'yŏngyang Massacre.

1. The Wanpaoshan Incident and Others

As this has already been widely reported through the newspapers, there is no need to repeat the course of events here. However, one cannot help but see that the potential for the incident was fully conceived the moment Kim Mo, Yi Mo, and 5-6 others, who were "'Good Koreans'" (善良な鮮人) affiliated with the Ch'angch'un Korean Residents' Association, received a loan of 5,000 Won (金五千圓也) from the financial cooperative (金融組合) as land reclamation funds through the consulate's (領事舘) mediation (斡旋). Traditionally, reclamation of several hundred *shang* (晌) of land could often be seen accomplished through the weak efforts of our compatriots themselves in various remote areas with inconvenient transportation. And to my limited knowledge (寡聞), I have yet to hear of a case where purely compatriot-funded construction was forcibly obstructed by armed force (武力).

If we list the causes of the Wanpaoshan Incident:
1. Although a contract for 500 *shang* was concluded, the irrigation ditch (洑), stretching over 20 *li*, had to cross the land of more than 40 people, yet lease contracts (借賃契約) were signed with only 8. The rest petitioned the county government (縣政府) for an order to halt the construction, citing the reason of flooding (浸水) of their respective properties.
2. The land reclamation funds were not invested by Koreans but were enterprise funds from the financial cooperative.
These are the main causes. Starting construction on land where contracts were not even completed, as in (1), relied solely on the power behind the investment (出資). (Omission - original text). To explain (2), let us satisfy ourselves by looking at the document concerning the Regulation of Land Purchase by Koreans issued by the Kirin Province (吉林省) authorities last October! Among the various clauses (條文), there is the following item:
“Regarding land purchase (購入) by Koreans, it must be strictly investigated whether the name is being lent to foreigners (他國人) and whether [Japanese] people (XX人) have invested (出資與否). Only after confirming that such facts do not exist can the transfer (讓渡) be permitted.”
Although the above text is merely a regulation order concerning Korean land purchase, we, with discerning eyes (慧眼), can easily regard (看做) its purpose (趣旨) as being the prevention (防止) of the encroachment (蠶蝕) of all foreign capital (外來資本) into the Eastern Provinces (東省). If we uncover several facts that have occurred since this spring besides the Wanpaoshan Incident:
1. In Xifangzujiapuzi (西方族家堡子), Kaewŏn County (開原縣), over 30 compatriot households had been managing paddy fields (水田) for several years. This spring, a "'Good Korean'" named Yang Chae-t'aek (梁載澤), chairman of the Ch'ŏllyŏng Korean People's Association (鐵嶺朝鮮人民會長), leased over 300 units of farmland (耕地), received 10,000 Won (萬圓) in development funds from the Tōa Kangyō Kōshi (East Asia Industrial Development Company, 東亞勸業公司), and was about to commence work when the source (出處) of the funds was exposed (綻露). Several related persons, including landlords (地主), were detained (拘禁), and the aforementioned 30-odd compatriot households, who had resided there for many years, also suffered much persecution (迫害) for allegedly communicating (通) with [Japanese] (X人).
2. 20 compatriot households residing in Sandaogou Shabaizikou (三道溝沙白子口), Ch'angch'un County (長春縣); 15 compatriot households in Wanquant'a (萬全塔), Nongan County (農安縣) (Kirin Province); over 40 compatriot households in Erdàogǎng (二道崗), Nongan County; and ten-odd (拾數戶) compatriot households in Shangdabeigou (上達貝溝), Pon'gye County (本溪縣) <30> were coerced (强迫) by Chinese officials to leave (退去), calling them unnaturalized foreigners (外國人) [Japanese] (XX人), despite it being the spring farming season (今春耕作期).
(4 lines deleted - original text)

2. Exclusion of Korean Residents (韓僑排斥) in 1927
If one looks historically for the oppression of Korean farmers by Chinese officials, it could be said to be after 1927. (6 lines omitted - original text) The places where the oppression against compatriots was most severe (甚酷) were:
Pongch'ŏn Province (奉天省) (Present Yonyŏng Province, 遼寧省)
Sinmin (新民), T'onghwa (通化), Pŏpk'o (法庫), Haeryong (海龍), Hwinam (輝南), Kaewŏn (開原), Sŏan (西安), Yŏnggu (營口), and other counties (各縣)
Kirin Province (吉林省)
Ch'angch'un (長春), Nongan (農安), a part of North Kando (北間島)
These areas, being spheres of influence of [Japanese] (XX) consulates, zones where "'Good Koreans'" were active, and areas of [Japanese] (XX人) capital investment (投資地), were where compatriots residing there suffered the worst fate (X運 - likely 不運, misfortune).

3. 'Good Koreans' (善良な鮮人)

There are various reasons why the actions of the so-called "'Good Koreans,'" members of the [Residents' Association] (X會員 - likely 民會) who inhabit (棲息) the zones of [Japanese] (XX) influence, become a cause for Chinese officials' and people's antipathy (X感 - likely 反感) and compatriot [oppression/exclusion] (XX - likely 壓迫/排斥), but here I will list only the following few:
1. The "'Good Koreans,'" protected by consular jurisdiction (領事裁判權) and filled with self-importance (自負心), feel an unconscious (無自覺) sense of superiority (優越感) towards Chinese people. They not only disobey instructions from the Chinese side, regardless of right or wrong (是非間), but sometimes also behave insultingly (侮辱的) towards Chinese officials and civilians.
2. Most hold immoral occupations (不道德的職業). These "'Good Koreans,'" inhabiting relatively conveniently located areas, use their special privilege (特權) – being treated the same as [Japanese] people (X人同樣) – as an opportunity (機貨 - likely 機會) to engage in trafficking (買賣) contraband goods (禁制品) like morphine (모루히네) and opium (阿片) in large numbers (多數).
Thus, the "'Good Koreans'" openly (公公然然) commit "non-good" (非善良) acts that [suck] (XX) the flesh and [suck] (XX는) the blood of the Chinese masses (國民衆). <31> Setting aside the South Manchuria Railway Zone (滿鐵附屬地), wherever there is a consulate, even in small towns in remote areas (奧地小市邑), there is invariably a Residents' Association (民會), and the contraband goods stores (禁制品商家) of the "'Good Koreans'" flourish (發達). While operating (經營) such contraband businesses, they also risk their lives (生命을 賭하고) striving to purchase land for the South Manchuria Railway (滿鐵, Mantetsu) and the Oriental Development Company (東拓, Tōyō Takushoku Kaisha / Dongcheok). How could Chinese officials and people not [react against/resent] (X치 안으랴 - likely 反撥/憤慨) this!

4. Land Purchase by Mantetsu and Dongcheok

Chinese officials and people call Korean farmers the vanguard (前衛) of Japan's Manchuria-Mongolia policy (日本滿蒙政策). Although this may not be the true intention (本意) of the hundreds of thousands of compatriots in Manchuria who hear this, it cannot be called entirely groundless slander (逆宣傳).
Mantetsu has established agencies called Mantetsu Public Offices (滿鐵公所) not only throughout its Railway Zone (附屬地一帶) but also in various remote areas, actively (盛) purchasing land using numerous "'Good Koreans'" as agents (압장이). Dongcheok is also succeeding in North Kando (北間島) no less than it did in Korea (朝鮮). Originally, in this Kando (此間島), there were more compatriot residents (同胞住民) than Chinese, and the area (面積) of land they owned (所有土地) was also considerable (相當). Dongcheok, through the 18 Residents' Associations (民會) in North Kando and an organization called the 'Relief Association' (救濟會), (8 lines omitted here - original text)

5. Miscellaneous Taxes (雜稅) Aggravated for Compatriots

China's backwardness (後進性) is also evident in its tax system (稅制), which lacks the orderly control (整然한 統制) of advanced capitalist countries (先進資本主義國家). Tax rates (稅率) and collection methods (徵收手段) vary from place to place (各地各樣), causing much suffering (괴롭게 하는바 만타) to the people (人民).
Looking at the tax system of Yonyŏng Province (遼寧省), taxes (稅), levies, and fees (捐費) are collected under various names (각색名目), including the land tax (田賦) corresponding to the land tax (地稅), tobacco tax (煙稅), liquor tax (酒稅), water tax (水稅), livestock tax (牲畜稅), and the extremely high-rate (非常히 高率인) salt tax (鹽稅), among others (其他). Furthermore, when farmers transport (運搬) their agricultural products (農作物) elsewhere (他處) for sale (販賣), they must first pay (先納) a production tax (出産稅) at the place of dispatch (發送地), i.e., the place of production (出産地). Not only must they pay a transit tax (過境稅) when passing through provincial borders (境界地), but upon arrival (到達) at the destination (目的地), they must pay a sales tax (銷場稅).
Even combining oppressive taxes (惡稅) like the salt tax and land tax, national taxes (國稅) like the liquor and tobacco taxes, and the extortionate levies (苛歉誅求) of the so-called Lijin system (釐金制度) such as production, transit, and sales taxes, it cannot be said to be excessive (過重) compared to Korea (朝鮮), where the burden (負擔) per household each year (每年每戶) is 150-160 Won (圓). Also, since these types of taxes (此種稅目) are not levied only on Koreans, perhaps they are not the subject to be discussed (論할바가 아닌가) here. <32>
Now, looking at the miscellaneous taxes levied only on Korean farmers, one can see how much the compatriots in Manchuria are suffering under double (二重) oppression. Among the Three Eastern Provinces (東三省), Yonyŏng Province is the region (地方) where this is most severe (甚) towards compatriots. The Korean Resident Levy (韓僑捐), Residence Certificate Fee (僑居證書費), Door Tax (門戶錢), Military Provisions Tax (兵餉錢), Defense Corps Fee (保衛團費), Relocation Fee (遷移費), Water Management Bureau Tax (水利局稅), etcetera (等等), are oppressive levies and miscellaneous taxes (惡捐雜稅) that compatriots must pay. Among these (就中), the three items – Korean Resident Levy, Residence Certificate Fee, and Relocation Fee – not only substantially (實質上) deprive (剝奪) Korean farmers of their freedom of residence (居住) and movement (遷移) but also simultaneously (同時) tie (얽매여) their bodies (身體) to the land, making exploitation (搾取) by the ruling class (支配階級) of warlord-landlords (軍閥地主) easier (容易), pushing impoverished (貧窮) compatriots into an even more (層一層) severe (深刻) state of slavery (奴隷狀態).
Just this spring (今年 春期), the Ch'ŏllyŏng County Government (鐵嶺縣政府) announced (公布) that compatriots residing within its jurisdiction (管內) must pay a fee (手數料) of 6 Yuan and receive (밧으라) the issuance (下付) of a Korean Resident's Residence Certificate (韓僑僑居證). In Yuha County (柳河縣), there was an instance (바 잇다) where the levy (賦課) of the Korean Resident Levy (韓僑捐) was announced for males (男子) aged 12 to 60. Then, when and from what motive (動機) were these oppressive regulations (惡制) – the Korean Resident Levy, Residence Certificate Fee, Relocation Fee, etc. – which cause Korean farmers to regress (逆轉) into serfs (農奴) of a previous century (前世紀), implemented (實施)? (22 lines omitted here - original text) It can be said (말할수 잇다) that [it lies] (는 ... 잇슴을) in the illicit union/collusion (野合) between the interests (利害) of [Japanese Imperialism] (6 characters omitted - original text - likely 日本帝國主義) and the Chinese warlords (中國軍閥). Although numerous incidents (多數한 事件) after 1927 indeed appeared (外形만은 果然) to be the exclusion of Koreans (朝鮮人排斥), the fact that the true intention (眞意) always (恒常) lay elsewhere (딴곳에 잇섯슴은) is shown by the zones (地帶) where the incidents occurred...
(13 lines omitted below - original text)

6. Conclusion

Thus (如斯히), what will become of the farmers in Manchuria (在滿農民) groaning (呻吟) under double oppression (二重壓迫)? As a conclusion from the preceding sections (前節까지의 結論), we [can say that] the cause of the Chinese officials' oppression of Korean farmers in Manchuria does not lie in the residence (居住) of Koreans within Chinese territory (中國領土內) itself, but in the prevention (侵入防止) or restraint (牽制) of [Japanese] (XX) power's invasion, or sometimes (때로) (Omission - original text)
Therefore (그럼으로), the cause of Chinese officials' oppression of Korean farmers does not lie in ethnic differences (民族的 差異) but actually stems from (由因한다) class nature (階級性).
Therefore (딸아서), what shall become of us? (以下全部略 - 원문) <33>

**Summary**

This 1931 editorial from the magazine *Samch'ŏlli* discusses the increasing oppression faced by Korean farmers in Manchuria by Chinese authorities. It argues that while incidents like the Wanpaoshan Incident are superficially about Korean settlement, the deeper causes involve Chinese resistance to Japanese encroachment (using Korean farmers, sometimes unwittingly, as proxies via entities like the South Manchuria Railway and the Oriental Development Company) and the exploitative actions of some pro-Japanese Koreans ("Good Koreans") involved in activities like smuggling. The article details specific incidents of eviction and persecution, highlights the role of Japanese capital and organizations, and lists various discriminatory taxes levied specifically on Koreans, which effectively bind them to the land for exploitation by warlords and landlords, often in collusion with Japanese interests. The author concludes that the oppression stems not from ethnicity but from the class dynamics intertwined with Japanese imperialism and Chinese internal politics.

For historians, this article is valuable as a contemporary Korean perspective on the complex and dangerous situation of Korean migrants in Manchuria during the pre-Manchukuo period. It reveals the internal differentiation within the Korean community (specifically mentioning "Good Koreans" collaborating with Japanese interests), acknowledges the linkage made by Chinese authorities between Korean farmers and Japanese expansionism (even if claiming it wasn't the farmers' intent), and details the specific mechanisms of economic and political oppression (discriminatory taxes, residence restrictions) used by local Chinese authorities. The explicit mention of Japanese organizations like Mantetsu and Dongcheok, the reference to consular jurisdiction, and the analysis connecting the oppression to both anti-Japanese sentiment and class exploitation by Chinese elites provide crucial insights into the inter-ethnic and geopolitical tensions leading up to the Manchurian Incident. The censorship (XX, omissions) itself is also indicative of the political climate under Japanese rule.

極東情勢와 在滿同胞, 天津 關內
同胞壓迫의 原因
겨우 生을 滿洲에 求하야 不食의 荒地를 沃畓으로 磽确의 땅을 沃田으로 만드러노은 百數十萬 朝鮮人農民에게 最近 4,5년 以來 中國官憲의 壓迫하는 傾向이 現著한 것도 不誣의 事實이다. 이 붓을 듬도 萬寶山事件 平壤慘案等 朝鮮 中國兩民族의 感情이 尖銳化한때 同胞壓迫의 一端을 究明하야 봄도 無意義한 일이 안이라 생각됨에서다.

1. 萬寶山事件 外 其他

이미 新聞을 通하야 널니 報導된 것임으로 이에 그 經過를 되푸리할 必要는 업겟스나 『善良な鮮人』인 長春朝鮮民會系 金某 李某等 5, 6人이 領事舘의 斡旋으로 金融組合으로부터 金5千圓也를 開墾資金으로 融通한 그 瞬間이 이미 事件發生의 可能性은 充分히 胚胎된 것으로 보지 안을수 업다. 在來로 幾百晌쯤의 土地開墾은 微弱한 同胞들의 自力으로나마 交通不便한 奧地各處에서 만히 볼수 잇는 일이며 寡聞인 吾人은 純全한 同胞出資의 工事에 대하야 武力으로써 强制的 防害를 加한 件을 아직 듯지 못하엿다.
萬寶山 事件의 原因을 들면
1. 500晌의 契約은 成立되엇스나 20餘里나 되는 洑은 40餘人의 土地를 거처야 함에도 不拘하고 借賃契約을 매즌 것은 겨우 8人에 不過하며 그 餘는 各所有地의 浸水를 理由로 該工事中止 命令을 縣政府에 呈請한 것.
2. 土地開墾 資金이 朝鮮人의 出資가 아니오 金融組合의 企業資金인 것.
等等이 原因의 大宗이라 하겟다. (1)과 如히 契約도 完成치 못한 土地에 工事를 着手한 것은 出資한 뒷 勢力만을 信賴한 (中略 - 원문) 이다. (2)를 說明하기 위하야 昨年10월 吉林省當局이 發布한 朝鮮人 土地購買取締에 관한 文獻을 봄으로써 滿足하자! 여러 條文中 左記의 項目이 잇다.
『朝鮮人의 土地購入에 대하야는 他國人에게 名義貸與의 有無와 XX人의 出資與否를 嚴密히 調査하고 그와 가튼 事實이 업슴을 確認한 然後에 비로소 讓渡함을 得함』.
以上의 文字는 單只 朝鮮人 土地購入에 관한 取締令이나 慧眼인 우리는 그 趣旨가 一切 外來資本의 東省蠶蝕을 防止함에 잇슴을 容易히 看做할 수 잇다. 萬寶山 事件以外에 今春以來 發生된 幾個의 事實을 摘發하야 보면
1. 開原縣西方族家 堡子에는 數年前부터 30餘戶의 同胞가 水田을 經營하야 오든바 鐵嶺 朝鮮人民 會長 梁載澤이라는 『善良な鮮人』이 今春 300餘日 耕地를 借得하야 開拓資金 萬圓을 東亞勸業公司로부터 밧어가지고 工事에 着手하랴다가 그 資金의 出處가 綻露되어 地主等 關係者 幾人은 拘禁되고 多年間 居住하야 오든 前記30餘戶 同胞들도 X人과 通한다고 만흔 迫害를 밧엇다.
2. 長春縣 3道溝沙白子口에 居住하는 20戶 同胞農安縣萬全塔15戶 同胞(吉林省)
農安縣 2道崗 40餘戶 同胞와 本溪縣上達貝 溝拾數戶同胞들은<30> 今春耕作期임에도 不拘하고 中國官憲으로부터 歸化치 안은 外國人 XX人이라 하야 退去를 强迫한 것 等等이다.
(4行削除 - 원문)

2. 1927년의 韓僑排斥
朝鮮人農民에게 대한 中國官憲의 壓迫을 歷史的으로 찻는다면 1927년 以後의 일이라 하겟다. (6行略 - 원문) 同胞에 대한 壓迫이 가장 甚酷하얏든 곳도
奉天省(現遼寧省)
新民 通化 法庫 海龍 輝南 開原 西安 營口等 各縣
吉林省
長春 農安 北間島의 一部
等地로 XX領事舘 勢力地 善良な鮮人의 活躍하는 地帶XX人 資本의 投資地等에 居住하는 同胞들이 가장 X運이엇다.

3. 善良な鮮人

XX勢力地帶에 棲息하는 所謂 『善良な鮮人』인 X會員들의 行動이 中國官民의 X感과 同胞XX의 一因을 이루는 것은 여러가지겟지만 여기서는 다음의 몃가지만 들겟다.
1. 善良な鮮人들은 領事裁判權의 保護와 그 自負心에서 中國人에 대하야 無自覺한 優越感을 늣기고 中國側의 指示에는 是非間 不服從일뿐 아니라 때로는 中國官民에게 대하야 侮辱的 行動을 하는 것.
2. 大部分이 不道德的 職業을 갓는 것이다. 比較的 交通便利한 곳에 棲息하는 그 『善良な鮮人』들은 그들이 갓는 特權- X人同樣의 取扱을 밧는 것을 機貨로 모루히네 阿片等의 禁制品을 買賣하는 者 多數인 것이다.
如斯히 善良な鮮人들은 中國民衆의 살을 XX피를 XX는 『非善良』을<31> 公公然然히 行한다. 滿鐵附屬地는 姑舍하고 奧地小市邑에까지 領事舘이 잇는 곳에 반드시 民會는 잇고 善良な鮮人들의 禁制品商家는 發達한다. 如斯한 禁製品商을 經營하는 一方 滿鐵 東拓의 土地購入에도 生命을 賭하고 努力을 하니 엇지 中國官民은 이에 X치 안으랴!

4. 滿鐵及東拓의 土地購買

中國官民은 朝鮮人農民을 日本滿蒙政策의 前衛라 한다. 이 말을 듯는 百數十萬의 在滿同胞도 本意가 아니겟스나 全然 無根한 逆宣傳이라고도 할 수 업다.
滿鐵은 附屬地一帶는 勿論이오 奧地各處에까지 滿鐵公所라는 機關을 設하야 노코 數만흔 『善良な鮮人』을 압장이로 土地購入을 盛히 하고잇고 東拓은 北間島에 잇서서도 朝鮮에서 지지안케 成功하고 잇다. 原來 此間島에는 同胞住民이 中國人보다도 만코 所有土地의 面積도 相當하다. 東拓은 北間島의 18民會와 『救濟!會』라는 機關을 通하야 (此間 8行略 - 원문)

5. 同胞에게 加重되는 雜稅

中國의 後進性은 稅制에 잇서서도 先進 資本主義國家와 如히 整然한 統制를 갓지 못하야 稅率及徵收手段이 各地各樣이어서 人民을 괴롭게 하는바 만타.
遼寧省의 稅制를 보면 地稅에 該當하는 田賦 煙稅 酒稅 水稅 牲畜稅 非常히 高率인 鹽稅等 其他 각색名目으로 稅 捐費를 徵收한다. 그리고 農民이 自己의 農作物을 販賣하기 위하야 他處로 運搬할 時는 發送地 卽 出産地에서 出産稅를 先納해야하고 省의 境界地를 通過할 때 또 過境稅를 納入해야 할뿐外라 目的地에 到達하면 銷場稅를 納付하지 안으면 안된다.
惡稅인 鹽稅, 田賦等의 國稅及酒煙稅外에 出産 過境銷場等 所謂 釐金制度의 苛歉誅求를 合한다하야 每年每戶에 150, 60圓의 負擔이 잇는 朝鮮에 比하야 過重하다 할수 업고 또 此種稅目은 朝鮮人에게만 賦課하는 것이 아임으로 本題에서 論할바가 아닌가. 한다.<32>
이제 朝鮮人農民에게만 賦課하는 雜稅를 보면 얼마나 在滿同胞들이 二重의 壓迫을 當하고 잇는지 알 것이다. 東三省에도 遼寧省이 同胞에게 대하야 가장 甚한 地方이니 韓僑捐 僑居證書費 門戶錢 兵餉錢 保衛團費 遷移費 水利局稅 等等은 同胞의 納付치 안으면 안되는 惡捐雜稅다. 就中韓僑捐 僑居證費 遷移費 等 3項은 朝鮮人農民의 居住와 遷移의 自由를 實質上으로 剝奪하는 同時 그들의 身體를 土地에다 얽매여 支配階級 軍閥地主의 搾取를 容易케 하며 貧窮한 同胞들을 層一層 深刻한 奴隷狀態에 빠지게 한다.
今年 春期만 하여도 鐵嶺縣政府는 管內에 居住하는 同胞들에게 手數料6元을 支拂하고 韓僑僑居證의 下付를 밧으라 公布하얏고 柳河縣에서는 12歲以上 60歲까지의 男子에게 韓僑捐의 賦課를 公布한 바 잇다. 그러면 朝鮮人農民을 前世紀의 農奴로 逆轉케 하는 韓僑捐 僑居證費 遷移費等 惡制는 언제부터 엇더한 動機에서 그것이 實施되엇나 (此間22行略 - 원문)  는 (6字畧 - 원문) 中國軍閥의 利害와의 野合에 잇슴을 말할수 잇다. 1927년 以後 多數한 事件은 外形만은 果然 朝鮮人排斥이엇스나 眞意가 恒常 딴곳에 잇섯슴은 事件發生의 地帶가

6. 結論

如斯히 二重壓迫에서 呻吟하는 在滿農民은 엇지 될것인가? 吾人은 前節까지의 結論으로 在滿朝鮮人農民에 대한 中國官憲의 壓迫原因이 中國領土內의 朝鮮人居住 그것에 잇지안코 XX勢力의 侵入防止 或은 牽制때로 (中略 - 원문)
그럼으로 中國官憲의 朝鮮農民 壓迫의 原因은 그 民族的 差異에 잇지 안코 實은 그 階級性에 由因한다.
