The Lineup of the Guangdong Government
						Kŏsan

According to sources knowledgeable in that area, the Government Committee members of the Guangdong Government are Wang Ching-wei (汪兆銘), Sun Fo (孫科), Hsü Ch'ung-chih (許崇智), Lin Sen (林森), Têng Tsê-ju (鄧澤如), Fan Fo-ch'eng (蕃佛成 - identity unclear), Ku Ying-fen (古應芬), Ch'en Chi-t'ang (陳濟棠), Pai Ch'ung-hsi (白崇禧), Li Tsung-jen (李宗仁), Tsou Lu (鄒魯), Ch'en Yu-jen (陳友仁), T'ang Sheng-chih (唐生智), Li Lieh-chün (李列釣 - likely 李烈鈞), T'ai K'o-wu (態克武 - identity unclear), and Chiang Tsun-kai (蔣尊盖 - identity unclear). Tang Shao-yi (唐紹儀) participated as a midwife figure. Among Sun Yat-sen's (孫文) disciples, only Hu Han-min (胡漢民), renowned as a brilliant talent but currently imprisoned, and perhaps Tai Chi-t'ao (戴天仇), whose confinement in the bleak atmosphere of Nanking (南京) leaves him helpless, T.V. Soong (宋子文), related to Mr. Chiang (蔣氏) by marriage, and Wu T'ieh-ch'eng (吳鐵城), who is excessively favored by Mr. Chiang, are the four remaining [with the Nanking government].
Looking at this, it seems that Mr. Chiang's so-called Sun Yat-sen-ism (孫文主義), while perhaps able to overcome armed intimidation, does not seem universally accepted under heaven.

Sun Yat-sen's Successor, Wang Ching-wei (汪兆銘)

Examining the lineup of this government now, Mr. Wang Ching-wei, along with Mr. Hu Han-min, is one of the more prominent figures among Sun Yat-sen's disciples and a giant among the Kuomintang (國民黨) elder faction.
A graduate of Japan's (日本) Chuo University (中央大學), he acted consistently alongside Sun Yat-sen, like a shadow following its form.
He possesses a rare purity of heart and fervent passion among Chinese (中國) politicians, and his conduct in public life is extremely fair and just.
Since the founding of the Republic, he was repeatedly urged to become a Minister of State Affairs but refused each time, focusing entirely on what he considered the urgent task in China at the time: "The people seizing political power." After Sun Yat-sen's death in July 1925, when the Guangdong Government (廣東政府) was reorganized into the Nationalist Government (國民政府), he became its Chairman, effectively Sun's successor.
However, pushed out and losing his position due to Chiang Kai-shek (蔣介石), who was merely a commandant of a military academy (軍官學校), he has since continuously resisted Chiang's militaristic rule as a behind-the-scenes figure in the anti-Chiang Kai-shek faction. How much Sun Yat-sen loved and trusted Mr. Wang among his numerous disciples can be seen from the newspapers in Peking (北京) at the time, which depicted the scene of 'Sun Yat-sen's Last Moments' at the Peking Hotel (北京飯店).
"Mr. Sun sadly tilted his head, looked lingeringly at the Kuomintang leaders standing side-by-side in the next room,
called 'Ching-wei (精衛)' (Wang's courtesy name), and said, 'You write down what I say now and convey it to all party members nationwide. Cooperate and unite, strive for the sake of the party members.' He dictated a testament of several hundred words, but because it was in Cantonese, Northerners<49> could not comprehend it," as reported by the newspapers of the time. This is the famous 'Testament' (遺訓) that has become China's scripture today.
There are those who point fingers at Mr. Wang, calling him a communist, but in his later years, Sun Yat-sen also had strong tendencies in that direction.
Even if it wasn't Russian (려시아)-style communism, it is a fact that he held principles and assertions close to it. To think that the young man who, in March of the 3rd year of Xuantong (宣統三年), infiltrated Peking alone intending to assassinate the Prince Regent Chun (攝政王) and Prince Su (肅親王), was caught hiding with a bomb under the bridge outside Zhengyangmen Gate (正陽門外), sentenced to death but received a special pardon, surviving against all odds, is now Mr. Wang Ching-wei, who enjoys immense popularity among the youth as the "Second Sun Yat-sen" in China today, one cannot help but feel the passage of time.

Sun Yat-sen's Heir, Sun Fo (孫科)

Although Mr. Sun Fo may be in the disadvantageous position of having his actual abilities discounted by half due to being Sun Yat-sen's son, he was raised in the United States (米國) from a young age, received an American-style education, and after returning to China, became the Mayor of Canton when his father Sun Yat-sen's Guangdong Government was established. As the leader of the so-called "Crown Prince Faction" of the Kuomintang, he wielded influence. In Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Government, he served as Minister of Railways, demonstrating considerable skill as one of the top executives. Seeing him now resolutely run under the banner of "Down with Chiang Kai-shek," he must certainly be a figure of considerable caliber.

The Radical Hsü Ch'ung-chih (許崇智)

Mr. Hsü Ch'ung-chih is a graduate of the Japanese Military Academy's (日本士官學校) 2nd Infantry class, hailing from a distinguished family whose grandfather was Hsü Ying-k'uei (許應癸), the Viceroy of Min-Che (閩浙總督) under the Qing (淸).
After graduating from the Japanese Military Academy and returning home, he entered the Fuzhou (福州) Army and rose through the ranks to be appointed commander of the 20th Brigade (第20協統領).
During the First Revolution (第1革命), he participated as the commander of the Fujian Army's Northern Expedition detachment in the siege of Nanking. After the failure of the Second Revolution (第2革命), he went into exile in Japan, the South Seas, etc. However, even after the revolution succeeded, he remained unchanged, serving as a military commander under Sun Yat-sen, consistently acting alongside him, and holding positions such as Commander of the Second Army of the Yue Army (奧軍第2軍長) and Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Route Bandit Suppression Army (東路討賊軍總司令). When Yuan Shih-k'ai's (袁世凱) imperial ambitions arose, he infiltrated Shanghai (上海) and, together with Ch'en Ch'i-mei (陳其美), who later died violently in Shanghai, initiated an opposition movement. Mr. Hsü was also the mastermind behind the famous 'Chao Ho Incident' (肇和奪取事件), where he secretly led a small group of about ten men at night to attack and seize the warship Chao Ho anchored on the Huangpu River (黃浦江上).
Furthermore, in 1924 (13년), when the Guangxi (廣西) army under Shen Chao-ying (沈兆英) and others captured Guangdong and drove out Mr. Sun, it was this Mr. Hsü who hastily gathered troops, repelled them, retook Guangdong, and welcomed Mr. Sun back.
Mr. Hsü, despite being from the bourgeoisie (뿌루쪼아) and possessing radical thinking unfitting for a subservient (事大主義한) military man, is quite rich in decisiveness.

Lin Sen (林森), Bearing Heavy Responsibility

Mr. Lin Sen is relatively an old-timer among Kuomintang politicians. Although from Fujian Province (福建省), he participated in Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary movement from his youth. When the first national government of the Republic was established in Nanking in the first year of the Republic (民國元年), he bore heavy expectations and was elected to the Senate (參議員). After the dissolution of the National Assembly,<50> he was active solely as a legislative council member (立法議員). In 1920 (9년), he became a member of the Guangdong Extraordinary Parliament (廣東非常國會議員), and in November 1922 (11년 11월), he was appointed to an honorable post in Fujian Province. Later, he also served as Minister of Construction (建設部長) under Sun Yat-sen's Guangdong Generalissimo government. He is a gentle, sincere, and highly respected politician.

Leader of the Western Hills Group (西山派), Tsou Lu (鄒魯)

Mr. Tsou Lu is considered more right-wing than anyone in the Kuomintang. He is a leader of the Western Hills Group (西山派).
From Guangdong Province (廣東省), he studied at the Guangdong Law and Politics School (廣東法政學堂). After the First Revolution, he participated in the establishment of the Nanking Provisional Government as a representative of the Guangdong Governor-General. During Ch'en Chiung-ming's (陳烱明) administration, he was appointed Garrison Commander of Qiongya (瓊崖鎭守使) and Pacification Commissioner of Chaoshan (潮汕綏靖督辯), but he did not accept the posts. In 1920 (9년), when Ch'en Chiung-ming returned to Guangdong, Tsou organized volunteer forces (義勇軍) to counter him. In 1923 (12년), he was appointed Director of the Guangdong Finance Department (廣東財政廳長). After Sun Yat-sen's death, he devoted himself to educational work as the president of Guangdong University (廣東大學長). However, because his ideology was too moderate (*和한), he was disliked and distanced (嫌遠되어) by the left-wing-dominated Guangdong leadership at the time, and remained out of favor thereafter.

American-Style Ch'en Yu-jen (陳友仁)

Mr. Ch'en Yu-jen is a graduate of an American university (米國大學). Although also from Guangdong, he is disliked by some because his demeanor is too Americanized. After the establishment of the Wuhan Government (武漢政府) immediately following Chiang Kai-shek's Northern Expedition, he was appointed to the prestigious position of Foreign Minister. However, his conduct was excessively radical, making him unpopular with the foreign diplomatic corps (外交團) in China, and he was even called a communist.

T'ang Sheng-chih (唐生智), Famous Through Military Prowess

Mr. T'ang Sheng-chih is merely a military man (武辨) from Hunan (湖南). His heyday was perhaps when he led the front line of Chiang Kai-shek's Northern Expeditionary Army, swiftly capturing Wuhan (武漢). Not long after, he was chased out by the Guangxi clique, went into exile in Beppu (別府), Japan, and later joined the Feng-Yen coalition. It was reported that he gathered his former subordinates in Hunan to raise an anti-Chiang army, but this too vanished like foam. Perhaps the Guangdong Government intends to use him as an army commander if they launch a Northern Expedition.

Li Lieh-chün (李烈釣 - likely 李烈鈞), with a Brilliant Military Career

Mr. Li Lieh-chün (李烈鈞) is a graduate of the Japanese Military Academy's 3rd class. Since the time of the Tongmenghui (同盟會), he acted alongside Yen Hsi-shan (閻錫山) and Sun Ch'uan-fang (孫傳芳). After the establishment of the Republic, he was appointed Military Governor of Jiangxi (江亞都督) at the young age of 30. In July 1913 (2년 7월), when the famous assassination of Sung Chiao-jen (宋敎仁) triggered what the world calls the Second Revolution, he raised the first voice against Yuan (討袁) in Jiangxi (江西), displaying the spirit of a newcomer. During Yuan Shih-k'ai's imperial ambitions in 1915 (4년), he secretly traveled far to Yunnan (雲南) and declared Yunnan's independence. This served as a catalyst, leading to successive declarations of independence by various provinces, eventually shattering Yuan Hung-hsien's (袁洪憲皇帝) dream and bringing about the establishment of the Republic's foundation. Since then, Mr. Li's military achievements have shone brightly (赫赫하게). His last major role was as Chief of the General Staff (參謀總長) when the tripartite coalition government of Chang (張), Tuan (段), and Sun (孫) was established in Peking in 1924 (13년). After Sun Yat-sen's death, it was reported that he retired to his hometown in Jiangxi, dedicating himself to educating the village children, finding joy in farming, personally holding a hoe and spade (鋤鍬). His participation in the Guangdong Government this time adds immense weight to the Guangdong faction.<51>

**Summary**

This 1931 article from the Korean magazine *Samch'ŏlli* outlines the key figures forming the anti-Chiang Kai-shek Guangdong Government. It profiles prominent Kuomintang members like Wang Ching-wei (portrayed as Sun Yat-sen's true successor), Sun Fo (Sun Yat-sen's son), Hsü Ch'ung-chih, Lin Sen, Tsou Lu, Ch'en Yu-jen, T'ang Sheng-chih, and Li Lieh-chün, detailing their backgrounds, political leanings (from radical to moderate), relationships with Sun Yat-sen and Chiang Kai-shek, and past roles. The article contrasts this lineup with the perceived weakness of Chiang's Nanking government, suggesting Chiang's claim to Sun Yat-sen's legacy is based more on force than popular acceptance.

From a Korean colonial history perspective, this article is interesting as it shows Koreans under Japanese rule were closely following complex political developments in China, particularly the internal power struggles within the Kuomintang. The detailed biographical sketches suggest access to considerable information about Chinese politics. For historians, it provides insight into how Chinese events were presented to a Korean audience, potentially shaping their views on China's potential as a regional power or ally, and implicitly contrasting the turmoil in China with the situation in colonized Korea. The level of detail about figures like Wang Ching-wei, including his time in Japan, might have resonated with Korean readers familiar with Japan.

廣東政府의 陣容
						巨山
그 方面의 消息通은 廣東政府 政府委員는 汪兆銘, 孫科, 許崇智, 林森,
鄧澤如, 蕃佛成, 古應芬, 陳濟棠,
白崇禧, 李宗仁, 鄒  魯, 陳友仁,
唐生智, 李列釣, 態克武, 蔣尊盖, 에 産婆役으로는 唐紹儀가 參加된바 孫文門下에도 俊英으로 일훔노픈 監禁中에 잇는 胡漢民과 또는 허울조흔 監禁이라 할가 아니라할가. 南京의 殺風景속에 어찌할 수 업는 戴天仇, 蔣氏와 姻戚關係잇는 宋子文과 蔣氏에게 지나친 重用을 밧고 잇는 吳鐵城의 四氏가 잇슬뿐이다.
이것으로 보더라도 所謂 蔣氏의 孫文主義란 大名文도 鐵砲에 의한 威迫을 除할 수는 잇다 할지라도 天下에 通用되는 것갓지도 안타.

孫文의 後繼者. 汪兆銘

지금 이 政府의 陣容을 살피건대 汪兆銘氏는 胡漢民氏와 한가지로 孫文門下에 보다 著名하고 國民黨 元老派中의 한 巨頭이다.
日本中央大學出身으로 孫文과는 거림자에 따르는 形象과도 가티 終始 行動을 한가지로.
中國政客中에 보기듬은 純情 熱血 그 出處進退가튼 것에도 極히 公明正大하다.
民國以來 國務大臣으로 慫慂된 일 屢次 잇섯스나 모다 내던지고 目下 中國에 잇서서는.
『國民이 政治를 잡는다』것이 急務라고 專혀 이것에 注力하고 1925년 7월 孫文死後의 廣東政府인가 國民政府와 改組하는 지음에 그 委員長으로 事實上의 孫氏 後繼者이 잇스나.
一介의 軍官學校長이란 武辯에 지나지 안는 蔣介石때문에 쫏기어 失脚하면서부터는 反蔣介石派의 黑幕中의 一人物로서 間斷업시 蔣의 武斷政治에 反抗하야 왓다. 孫文이 數만흔 門下中에서도 얼마나 汪氏를 사랑하야 미덧는가는 北京飯店에 잇서서.
『孫文臨終』의 場面을 그린 當時의 北京의 新聞을 보면 알 것이다.
『孫氏는 슬픈 듯 머리를 기옷둥둥 다음室에 나란히 서잇는 國民黨要人을 물그름 한번보고는.
『精衛』하고 汪氏를 불러 『지금 말하는 것을 네가 筆記하야 그것을 全國黨員에 傳하여라. 協力一致 黨員을 위하야 努力하여다오』라고 數百言이 넘는 遺言을 口述하얏스나 이것은 廣東語인 까닭에 北方人게는<49> 헤에아리지 못하엿다함은 當時의 新聞의 傳하는 바이지만, 이것이 지금의 中國의 敎書가 되잇는 有名한 『遺訓』인 것이다.
汪氏를 손짓하야 共産主義者라고 하는 자가 잇스나 晩年의 孫文에게도 그 傾向이 實로 濃厚하얏슴이라.
『려시아』流의 共産主義가 아니라 할지라도 그것에 近似한 主義主張을 가지고 잇섯다는 것은 事實이다. 宣統3년 3월때는 攝政王 肅親王을 暗殺하랴고 單身 北京에 潛入하고 正陽門外의 橋下에 爆彈을 품고 潛伏中 드듸어 자피어 死刑을 宣告바덧스나 特赦로 되어 九死에 一生을 어든 靑年이 今日 中國에 잇서서 第二孫文이라고 靑年間에 絶大한 人氣가 잇는 汪兆銘氏 그사람이라 하면 今昔感이 안일수가 업슬 것이다.

孫文의 遺兒. 孫科

孫科氏는 孫文의 아들이란 점에 그 實力을 半割引된 不利한 立場에 잇슬지라도 幼少부터 米國에 잇서서 길느게 되어 米國流의 敎育을 밧고 歸國한 뒤에 父孫文의 廣東政府가 成立되면서부터 廣東市長이 되어 所謂 國民黨의 太子派首領으로서 힘을 펴고 蔣介石의 國民政府에서는 鐵道部長으로서 最高幹部의 한사람으로 相當한 手腕을 보이헛고 지금 또 決然히 打倒蔣介石의 傘下에 다름처온 것을 보더라도 相當한 人物임에 틀림업슬 것이다.

急進的인 許崇智

許崇智氏는 日本士官學校 步兵科 第2期의 出身, 淸의 閭浙總督 許應癸을 祖父에 가진 名門의 出身이다.
日本士官學校을 卒業後 歸國하야는 福州陸軍에 들어가 累進第20協統領에 任名되어.
第1革命에는 閭軍北伐支隊司令으로서 南京攻圍軍에 參加하야 第2革命의 失敗後는 日本南洋等에 亡命하얏스나 革命成功後도 終始 變치 안코 孫文幕下의 武將으로서 孫氏와 行動을 한가지로 하야 奧軍第2軍長 東路討賊軍總司令等에 就任되다. 袁世凱의 帝制問題가 生起자 上海에 潛入한 뒤에 上海에서 橫死한 陳其美氏와 한가지로 反對運動을 이루키고 暗夜 秘密히 10여명의 小人數로써 黃浦江上에 뜬 軍艦肇和를 襲擊하야 이것을 奪取한 有名한 『肇奪取事件』의 主謀도 許氏 그 사람이엇다.
또 13년 沈兆英等의 廣西軍이 廣東을 攻略하야 孫氏를 쪼치자 急遽軍을 모아 이것을 擊退하야 廣東을 奪回하고 孫氏를 마즌것도 이 許氏엇다.
許氏는 『뿌루쪼아』出이며 그우에 事大主義한 軍人에 似合치 안흔 急進的인 思想의 所有者라 퍽 決斷性에 豊富한 사람이다.

重望을 負한 林森

林森氏는 國民黨의 政客으로서는 舊人편이다. 福建省의 出身이나 靑年時代부터 孫文의 革命運動에 參加하고 民國 元年 南京에 國民最初의 政府가 成立하자 重望을 등지고 參議員에 選出되다. 國會解散後는<50> 專혀 立法議員으로서 活躍하고 9년에는 廣東非常國會議員이 되어 11년 11월에는 福建省에 榮職으로 就任되다. 後에 孫文의 廣東大元帥 建設部長에 任하엿슬때도 잇섯다. 溫厚篤實德望이 노픈 政治家이다.

西山派의 巨頭. 鄒魯

鄒魯氏는 國民黨中 누구보다 右翼이라 본다. 西山派의 巨頭이다.
廣東省의 出身이며 廣東法政學堂에 배워 第1革命後는 廣東都督代表로서 南京臨時政府成立에 參與하고 陳烱明의 執政時代 瓊崖 鎭守使 潮汕綏靖督辯에 任命되엿스나 應치 안헛다. 9년 陳烱明 回奧의를 이르키자 義勇軍을 組織하고 이것에 對抗하야 12년에는 廣東財政廳長에 任命되엇다. 孫文의 死後는 廣東大學長으로서 育英事業에 從事하얏스나 思想이 너무도 *和한 까닭에 左翼全盛의 當時의 廣東主腦部에 嫌遠되어 爾來不遇이엇섯다.

米國流의 陳友仁

陳友仁氏는 米國大學의 出身인 것 또한 廣東出이나 너무도 爲人이 米國風을 떠는 故로 一部人士에게 嫌惡을 밧는다. 蔣介石의 北伐直後 武漢政府의 成立後는 그 外交部長의 榮位에 就任하얏스나 性行過激에 失하야 在中國 外交團의 人氣는 모다 자미업고 共産主義者라고까지 이름한다.

以武鳴唐生智

唐生智氏는 湖南出身의 一武辨에 지나지 안는다. 蔣介石의 北伐軍의 第一線을 마트고 長驅武漢을 陷落시킬때가 全盛時代라 할가. 얼마안되어 廣西派때문에 쫏기어 日本別府에 亡命하고 後에 馮 閻 合作에 加하야 湖南의 舊部下를 모아 反蔣軍을 이르킨다 傳하얏스나 이것도 어느새 물거품으로 사러지고 말엇다. 大槪 廣東政府로서는 北伐軍이라도 이르키면 그 軍團長에나 쓸가.

軍歷赫赫한. 李烈釣

李烈釣氏는 日本士官學校 第3期生 閻錫山 孫文芳과는 同盟會以來 行動을 한가지로 民國成立後는 僅히 年齒 30歲로 江亞都督에 就任되다. 2년 7월 有名한 宋敎仁暗殺이 導火線이 되어 세상에서 말하는 第2革命이 爆發되자 討袁의 第一聲을 江西에 擧하야 新人의 意氣를 나타내고 4년의 袁世凱帝制問題에는 멀리 雲南에 潛行하야 雲南의 獨立을 宣言하얏스나 이것이 動機가 되어 各省獨立續出하야 드듸어 袁洪憲皇帝의 꿈은 살어저 民國의 基礎確立을 招來하얏다. 爾來 氏의 軍功은 赫赫하게 빗낫다. 13년에 張 段 孫의 三派聯合政府가 北京에 成立되자 그 參謀總長에 就任한 것을 最後로서 孫文의 死後는 鄕里江西에 隱棲하야 鄕村의 子弟敎育에 盡力하고 스스로 鋤鍬를 잡고 耕農을 樂을 삼고 잇고 잇다고 傳하엿섯는데 今回 다시 同氏의 廣東政府參加는 更히 廣東系로 하여금 萬丈의 무개를 加한 것이다 할가.<51>
