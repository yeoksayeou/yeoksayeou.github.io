**Summary**

This article is an announcement from the magazine *Samch'ŏlli* launching a beauty contest in September 1931. It calls upon readers ("Compatriots") to submit recent photographs of Korean women aged 18 or older to select a "beautiful woman (麗人) to boast of to the world." Gold prizes are offered to both the winner and the person who submitted her photo, with results to be published in the October anniversary issue. From a historical perspective, this contest reflects the burgeoning mass media culture in colonial Korea and the complex interplay of national identity, modern beauty standards, and public participation under Japanese rule. It signifies an attempt to define and celebrate Korean beauty on a national (and implicitly, international) stage, potentially as a form of cultural assertion, even within the constraints of colonialism.
