Leading Figures of China's Financial World
						By Sanghae Akyangnu Kŏsa

It is said that China has no zaibatsu (財閥). Why is that? Because, they say, there is nothing comparable to Japan's Mitsui or Mitsubishi. Indeed, as the consumer class (消費階級) constitutes the vast majority, and consequently, the populace is largely composed of peasants (農民), China, where cities have not developed (發達) enough to rival the countryside, is seen as having no possibility (可能) of producing great zaibatsu capable of moving the world economy, at least for some time. Just as the Qing Dynasty (淸朝時代) relied on the full financial power (全權) of Shanxi (山西), today's Nanjing Government (南京政府) cannot maintain itself without the full financial power of Zhejiang (浙江). Those who grasp this financial power form a clique based on China's unique shared connections (同居關係). If one calls this a zaibatsu, perhaps in a different sense, it could be called a zaibatsu. Many people classify these Chinese zaibatsu in this sense into the Zhejiang clique (浙江財閥), Guangdong clique (廣東財閥), and Jiangsu clique (江蘇財閥). However, the one holding the purse strings (金權) for the Nanjing Government today is the Zhejiang clique, the 'patrons' of Chiang Kai-shek (蔣介石) and Song Ziwen (宋子文). The Guangdong clique holds real power (實權) in trade relations (貿易關係) and department store management (百貨店經營), but does not possess full financial control. The Jiangsu clique also falls far short of the Zhejiang clique's power (到底히).

Chang Kung-ch'üan (張公權)

Born in Zhejiang, he was once active as the Deputy Manager (副經理) of the Bank of China (中國銀行) in Shanghai. In the 5th year of the Republic (1916), when Yüan Shih-k'ai (袁世凱) became President, and the Bank of China issued an order suspending specie payments (兌換停止令), he conspired with Sung Han-chang (宋漢章) to carry out the independence of the Shanghai branch (上海分行), suddenly resumed specie payments, and saved the Shanghai financial world from crisis. Since then, his name (일홈) became known for its importance (重함) in China. Afterwards, he was promoted (昇任) to Vice President of the Beijing Head Office (北京總行), but later was appointed (就任) Deputy Manager of the Shanghai Branch again. In June of the 17th year of the Republic (1928), when Nationalist Government (國民政府) Finance Minister Song Ziwen held the National Economic Conference (全國經濟會議) in Shanghai, he was selected (選拔) as a committee member (委員), made many proposals (建議) regarding financial and monetary issues, gained Song's trust (信任), and currently holds the important positions of Managing Director (常務董事 - meaning Director/理事) and Deputy Manager of the Bank of China Head Office. He is a key figure (中堅) of the Zhejiang clique.

Chang Ching-chiang (張靜江)

A wealthy gentleman (富紳) from Nanchen (南鎭), Wuxian County (吳縣), Zhejiang Province. Although he inherited several million yuan (數百萬元) from his ancestors (父祖), as a result of his dedication (心醉) to the revolution, he lost (이젓다) most of his assets (資産) helping the movements (運動) of Sun Wen (孫文), Ch'en Ch'i-mei (陳其美), and Chiang Kai-shek. He is a great contributor (大功勞者) to the so-called National Revolution (國民革命). Since the First National Congress (第一次 全國代表大會), he has always been appointed (運任) to the Central Executive Committee (中央執行委員), once served (就任) as Chairman of the Central Political Council (中央政治會議主席),<52> and currently holds the important positions of Standing Committee Member of the Central Supervisory Committee (中央監察委員會 常務委員), National Construction Committee (全國建設委員) member, Chairman (主席), and Chief (首席) of the Zhejiang Provincial Government (浙江省政府).

Yü Hsia-ch'ing (虞洽卿)

Born in Sanbei (三北), Ningbo (寧波), he is the leader (首領) of the Zhejiang clique. He currently holds the prominent positions (顯職) of Member of the Shanghai International Settlement Municipal Council (上海共同租界市參會員), Supervisor (監事) of the Central Bank (中央銀行), Chairman of the Board of Directors (理事長) of the Shanghai Stock and Commodities Exchange (上海證券物品交易所), General Manager (總理) of the Sanbei Steamship Company (三北輪船公司), Comprador (買辨) of the Commercial and Industrial Bank (商工銀行), and Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipality Merchant Groups Reorganization Committee (上海特別市 商人團體整理委員會 常務委員主席). His assets are said to be 400,000 to 500,000 taels (兩). It is famous that he contended with Ch'uan Tzu-an (傳子庵), a giant of the Shanghai financial world born from the Zhejiang clique; publicly for the chairmanship (會長) of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce (上海總商會), and privately, challenging Ch'uan's position as manager (經理) of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (招商輪船總局) with his own position as General Manager of the Sanbei Steamship Company, almost achieving victory (勝利를 制한).

Li Ming (李銘)

A Zhejiang native, he once studied abroad (留學) in Japan, graduated (卒業) from Yamaguchi Higher Commercial School (山口高等商業學校), then entered the Yokohama Specie Bank (正金銀行) in Yokohama (橫濱) to gain practical experience (實務 見習). After returning home (歸國後), he worked (勤務) at the Zhejiang Bank (浙江銀行) and currently holds multiple important positions, including Director (董事) and General Supervisor (總監理) of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank (浙江實業銀行), Supervisor (監事) of the Central Bank, Chairman of the Board (董事長) of the Bank of China, and Chairman (主席) of the Jianghai Customs 2.5% Surtax Treasury Bonds Fund Custody Committee (江海關二五附稅國庫券基金保管委員會). He is extremely close (親密) to Song Ziwen, and his advice (獻策) to Song on financial and monetary issues is thoroughly accepted (삿삿치 들어 바듬이 되어), giving him extraordinary hidden influence (潛勢力) in the financial world.

Ch'ien Hsin-chih (錢新之)

Born in Shanghai, from a banking family (銀行家出). For many years, he worked at the Shanghai Bank of Communications (上海交通銀行), gaining a high reputation (令名이 노파섯다) as its manager (經理) and as a director (會董) of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. In the 11th year of the Republic (1922), when Chang Ch'ien (張騫) became President (總理) of the Beijing Head Office of the Bank of Communications, Ch'ien Hsin-chih was selected (拔擢) as Head Office Assistant Manager (總行協理). In the 16th year of the Republic (1927), he rose (들어나) to important positions such as Vice Minister of Finance (財政部次長) and Acting Minister of Finance (代理財政部長) in the Nationalist Government, helping to overcome (打開) the financial difficulties (財政難局) of the Nationalist Government during the Northern Expedition (北伐戰爭). Currently, he holds important positions such as Member and Finance Department Director (財政廳長) of the Zhejiang Provincial Government Committee (浙江省政府委員), Managing Director (常務董事) of the Bank of Communications, Director (理事) of the Central Bank, General Manager (總經理) of the Zhongxing Coal Mining Company (中興煤礦公司), and Director (主任) of the Four Banks Joint Reserve Treasury (四行聯合準備庫) for Chung Nan (中南), Continental (大陸), Yien Yieh (鹽業), and Kincheng (金城) banks. He is extremely well-rounded (圓滿) and gentle (溫厚), and because he has many acquaintances (知友) in the Jiangsu clique (江蘇財閥), he is active in coordinating and facilitating connections (連絡融通) with the Zhejiang faction (浙江系). Born in Ningbo, he came from the native banking business (錢莊業出身). As manager (經理) of the Fu Yuan Native Bank (副源錢莊), he concurrently served as Chairman (會長) of the Native Bankers' Association (錢業公會) and Vice Chairman (副會長) of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce for 20 years. Currently, as a Standing Committee Member (常務委員) of the Native Bankers' Association, his reputation (聲聖) in the native banking world is very high. He attended the National Economic Conference in the 17th year of the Republic (1928) as a committee member, exerting great effort (奔走), and also rendered distinguished service (功勞多) in the Nationalist Government's treasury bond subscription drives (國庫券募集). Consequently, Finance Minister Song's trust (信用) in him is said to be extremely deep (두텁다), and his current important position as Supervisor (監事) of the Central Bank is said to be perhaps a reward (報酬) for his efforts.

Ch'in Shao-shan (秦少山)

A Cantonese (廣東人). In terms of regional ties (鄕土的 關係), he belongs outside the clique (閥外), but due to business management (經理), administrative relations (事務 的關係), and personal connections (個人的 關係), both he and others alike consider him part of the Zhejiang clique (浙江財閥에 認定밧고 잇다). He manages the Wenchenglong Trading House (文成隆號 - hardware [金物], general goods [雜貨], foreign paper [洋紙])<53> and is also a director (董事) of the Longzhang Paper Company (龍章造紙公司). Since being elected (選出) as a director (會董) in the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce officer elections (役員改選) in the 9th year of the Republic (1920), he gained great fame (盛名을 날리엇다) by working hard (奔走) for the rescue (救出) of Chinese and foreign victims (被殺人) of the Lincheng Incident (臨城事件) and by attending the Tariff Conference (關稅會議) in Beijing. Especially when he advocated (提唱) for a merchant revolution (商人革命) against the election of Ts'ao K'un (曹錕) as President (大總統補選), he startled (耳目을 聳動시키고) Chinese and foreign observers and fully demonstrated (發揮하엿든 것이다) his character as a prominent figure (新人된 面目). Since the entry of the National Revolutionary Army into Shanghai in the spring of the 16th year of the Republic (1927), with the support (援助) of Yü Hsia-ch'ing and others, he collaborated (提携) with Lin K'ang-hou (林康侯), using the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce as his base (根據), to wield extraordinary influence (異常한 勢力), giving the impression (뉘낌이 잇서섯다) for a time that his power dominated (風靡) the Shanghai financial world. He worked hard (奔走) for the Nationalist Government's treasury bond subscription drives and was highly regarded (重視된 바 되엇스나) by Chiang Kai-shek and Song Ziwen. However, in May of the year before last (1929), he engaged in a struggle for supremacy (爭覇戰) over leadership of the business community against the Shanghai National Salvation Association (上海國民救會), the Shanghai Special Municipality Merchants and Residents Association (上海特別市商民協會), and the Shanghai Special Municipality Guidance Committee (上海特別市指導委員會), ultimately resulting in victory (勝利에 돌아갓다) for him, the capitalist (資本家).

Lin K'ang-hou (林康候)

A Shanghainese (上海人). He once concurrently held positions such as Professor at Nanyang University (南洋大學敎授), Manager (經理) of Xinhua Savings Bank (新華貯蓄銀行), and Manager of the Shanghai Branch (上海分行經理) of Zhonghua Industrial Bank (中華興業銀行). Since the entry of the National Revolutionary Army into Shanghai, he, along with Feng Shao-shan (馮少山 - typo for 秦少山, Ch'in Shao-shan?), wielded considerable influence (만흔 勢力을 폇다) based in the General Chamber of Commerce (總商會). Currently, he concurrently holds important positions such as Director (董事) of the Bank of Shanghai (上海銀行), Vice Chairman (副主席) of the Jianghai Customs 2.5% Surtax Treasury Bonds Fund Custody Committee (江海關二五附稅國庫券基金 保管委員會), Supervisor (監事) of the Central Bank, and Chinese Advisory Committee Member of the Shanghai International Settlement Municipal Council (上海共同租界工部局華人顧問委員).

Shih Liang-ts'ai (史量才)

From Nanjing (南京人), but belongs to the Zhejiang clique (浙江閥) in a broad sense. He passed the imperial examination (科擧) in the late Qing (淸末). Since taking over (마튼以來) the Shen Bao newspaper office (申報舘) with the backing (後援) of Chang Ch'ien (張騫), he gradually became wealthy (富裕), then also seized real power (實權) at the Shi Shi Xin Bao newspaper office (時事新報舘), and subsequently acquired half the shares (株式一半) of the Xin Wen Bao newspaper office (新聞報舘) recently, aiming to build a newspaper "trust" (新聞「트라스트」) based on these three major Chinese newspapers. In a sense, he is a Chinese "fascist" (「파시-스트」). Besides the newspaper business, he holds importance (重함) in the business world (實業界) as a major shareholder (大株主) and director (董事) of the Chung Nan Bank (中南銀行) and the Wuzhou Great Pharmacy (五州大藥房).<54>

**Summary**

This 1931 article discusses the structure of financial power in China, arguing that unlike Japan with its dominant zaibatsu like Mitsui and Mitsubishi, China's power lies in regional financial cliques due to its largely agrarian economy. The piece focuses heavily on the Zhejiang clique, portraying it as the indispensable financial backbone of the Nationalist government in Nanjing, particularly supporting Chiang Kai-shek and Finance Minister Song Ziwen. It provides biographical sketches of prominent financiers connected primarily to this clique and Shanghai's banking and commercial sectors, detailing their rise, influence, connections, and roles in supporting the government and navigating the complex financial landscape of the era.

From the perspective of Korean colonial history, the article is interesting as it shows a Korean author providing a detailed analysis of the contemporary Chinese economic and political scene for a Korean audience. The direct comparison between Chinese financial cliques and Japanese zaibatsu reflects the pervasive influence and awareness of the Japanese economic model in colonized Korea. It highlights Korean interest in the internal power dynamics of China, especially the relationship between finance and the Nationalist regime. Historians might find the specific framing of Chinese capitalism (or lack thereof in the Japanese sense) and the focus on the Zhejiang clique's power insightful for understanding how neighboring countries, particularly one under Japanese rule, perceived China's development and political economy during this critical period.

中國財界의 首腦人物
						上海 岳陽樓居士
中國에는 財閥이 업다고한다. 웨그러냐하면 日本에 三井이나 三菱에 對抗할 만한 것이 못되는 까닭이라고-.  事實 都*消費階級이 大多數이며 따라 國民全體가 大部分 農民인 故로.
都市가 農村에 對抗할 말큼한 發達이 못되는 中國에서는 어느 時期까지는 世界經濟를 움즉일만한 大財閥이 生起일 可能이 업다고 본다. 淸朝時代에 山西의 全權을 背普으로 한것과 한가지로 오늘날 南京政府가 浙江의 全權이 업시는 維持해 나아갈 수 업는 것이다. 이것等의 全權掌握者는 中國特有의 同居關係로 한 閥을 맷고 잇다. 이것을 財閥이라 말하면 다른 意味로 보아 財閥이라 말할 수 잇스리라. 만흔 사람은 이러한 意味의 中國財閥을 浙江財閥, 廣東財閥, 江蘇財閥에 나슬 수 잇다. 그러나 오늘날 南京政府에 대한 金權을 잡고 잇는 것은 蔣介石, 宋子文의 『파트론』인 浙江財閥이다. 廣東財閥은 貿易關係, 百貨店經營의 實權을 掌握하고 잇스나 全權은 갓지 안헛다. 江蘇財閥도 到底히 浙江財閥에 힘에 못미친다.
