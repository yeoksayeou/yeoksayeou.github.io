For the Chungoe Ilbo, it is said to be 200,000 won from the Yi Usik (李祐植) faction and 150,000 won from the Paek In'gi (白寅基) faction, etc.

It is reported that former Tonga Ilbo president Kim Sŏngsu (金性洙) recently returned from a tour of various countries in Europe and America, and it is said that his travel expenses and other costs amounted to approximately 40,000 won.
