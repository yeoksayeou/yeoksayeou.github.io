Su-gangnu (受降樓)

Located on the bank of the Tuman River (豆滿江畔) in Chongsŏng, North Hamgyŏng Province (咸北鍾城), it is a victory commemoration pavilion (勝戰紀念樓) from the Koryŏ (高麗) era, greatly moving contemporary people.<23>

**Summary**

This short news item describes the Su-gangnu pavilion, located by the Tuman River in Chongsŏng, North Hamgyŏng Province. It notes that the pavilion commemorates a victory from the Goryeo dynasty and evokes strong feelings in people of the time (1931). For historians, this piece is interesting as it highlights the persistence of Korean historical memory and pride associated with pre-colonial military achievements (Goryeo victory) even during the Japanese occupation. Mentioning such monuments could serve as subtle reminders of national identity and past independence.
