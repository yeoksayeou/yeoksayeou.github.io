**Summary**

This article is an announcement from the Korean magazine *Samch'ŏlli* in September 1931, launching a beauty contest called "Samch'ŏlli Ilsĕk" (The Finest Beauty of Korea). It calls for readers to submit recent photographs of Korean women aged 18 or older by September 15th. The winner, selected by aesthetic experts, and the person who submitted her photo will receive gold prizes. The results will be published in the October anniversary issue as part of the magazine's commemorative project. For historians, this piece reflects the burgeoning popular culture and media landscape in colonial Korea, the adoption of Western-style beauty contests, and the complex interplay of national identity ("Compatriots!", "Korean woman", "beautiful rivers and mountains") and modern commercial/media practices under Japanese rule. The focus on publicly selecting and celebrating Korean female beauty can be seen as a form of cultural assertion within the colonial context.
