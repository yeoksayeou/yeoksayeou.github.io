**Body Text Translation:**
Nine years ago today, Chosŏnin (Koreans) heading to the Narashino internment camp during the Great Kantō Earthquake in Tōkyō <5>

**Summary**

This text is a caption for a photograph published in the September 1, 1931 issue of the magazine Samch'ŏlli, under the recurring feature "Wall Newspaper." The caption identifies the image as showing Koreans being transported to the Narashino internment camp in Japan exactly nine years prior, during the chaos following the Great Kantō Earthquake on September 1, 1923. For historians, this caption is significant as it directly references the rounding up and internment of Koreans following the earthquake, a period marked by widespread racist violence and massacres against the Korean population in Japan fueled by false rumors. The mention of the Narashino camp points to the official Japanese involvement in detaining Koreans during this crisis.
