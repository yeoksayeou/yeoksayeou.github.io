**Summary**

This is a brief announcement (社告) from the editors of Samch'ŏlli magazine, informing readers about the upcoming content for the ongoing series "Chronicle of Successive Leaders" (歷代巨頭記). The next installment will cover significant figures and events related to major religions (Ch'ŏndogyo, Buddhism, Christianity), educational/academic groups (Sŏbuk Academic Society, P'yŏngyang Taesŏng School), prominent banks (Hansŏng, Tongil, Haedong, other commercial banks), and other major organizations ("Samch'ong"). For historians, this announcement highlights the magazine's focus on influential institutions and figures across diverse sectors (religion, education, finance, civic groups) in colonial Korea, reflecting the perceived key players shaping society at the time. The inclusion of both traditional Korean entities and modern institutions like banks provides insight into the social landscape the magazine aimed to represent.
