Urgent Notice

As the Samch'ŏlli Company (三千里社) is currently undergoing a major expansion (大擴張), the postal transfer account (振替口座) is being changed and increased. Therefore, those sending money (送金) to the Samch'ŏlli Company should, for the time being (當分), please make the postal transfer payment (振替拂入) under the name below:
Postal Transfer Kyŏngsŏng 4284 Man'guk Puin Sa (萬國婦人社) <57>

**Summary**

This article is a brief administrative notice from the Samch'ŏlli Company informing readers and subscribers about a temporary change in their postal transfer account details due to ongoing business expansion. It instructs them to send payments to account number Kyŏngsŏng 4284, held under the name Man'guk Puin Sa, for the time being. For historians, this notice provides a glimpse into the business operations of a Korean publishing house during the colonial period, highlighting its expansion efforts and reliance on the postal transfer system for financial transactions. The temporary use of another entity's account (Man'guk Puin Sa) might suggest financial restructuring, a partnership, or logistical arrangements during this expansion phase.
