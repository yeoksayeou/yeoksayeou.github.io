A Wedding Parade

Recently, marriages among public figures have been flourishing. Critic Pak Wŏn-gŭn (朴元根氏) welcomed his flower-like bride and completed the wedding ceremony (花燭) in P'yŏngyang (平壤) on March 17th. Pak Myŏng-hwan (朴明煥氏) of the former Singanhoe (新幹會) has been in a romantic relationship (戀愛) with Miss Chang Tŏk-cho (張德祚孃) of Taegu (大邱), a renowned female writer (女流文士), and they will be holding their ceremony soon (近近). Furthermore, Miss Kim Wŏn-ju (金源珠孃), a female writer whose elegant writing style once swept the era, has also made a happy promise (佳約) with a certain gentleman (某氏) from Kyŏngbuk (慶北) and, it is said, has flown high and far away (高飛遠走) towards Shanghai (上海) by airplane (飛行機). <29>

**Summary**

This short news article from the April 1933 issue of Samch'ŏlli magazine reports on a series of recent or impending marriages involving Korean intellectuals and writers. It mentions the critic Pak Wŏn-gŭn's wedding in P'yŏngyang, the upcoming marriage of former Singanhoe activist Pak Myŏng-hwan to the writer Chang Tŏk-cho, and the writer Kim Wŏn-ju's marriage and subsequent departure to Shanghai by airplane. For historians, the article offers a glimpse into the social lives and networks of Korean intellectuals during the colonial period. The mention of prominent female writers (Chang Tŏk-cho, Kim Wŏn-ju) highlights their public visibility, while Kim Wŏn-ju's travel to Shanghai by airplane points to modernization and transnational connections, even under colonial rule. The involvement of a former Singanhoe member is also notable.
