Company Announcement

Samch'ŏlli's sister publication, "Manguk Puin" (萬國婦人), which has been in publication until now, will be temporarily suspended due to unavoidable circumstances and will resume publication from this autumn. Therefore, although we apologize to the monthly subscribers of Manguk Puin, we will send Samch'ŏlli instead. Please understand.

From the Samch'ŏlli Company <87>

**Summary**

This is a brief announcement from the Samch'ŏlli Company informing readers that its sister magazine, "Manguk Puin" (Women of All Nations), is being temporarily suspended due to unspecified "unavoidable circumstances." Publication is expected to resume in the autumn. In the interim, subscribers to "Manguk Puin" will receive the main magazine, "Samch'ŏlli," instead. For historians, this notice highlights the precarious nature of publishing, particularly specialized publications like women's magazines, during the colonial period in Korea. The vague reason "unavoidable circumstances" could point to financial difficulties, censorship issues, or other pressures common under Japanese rule, making it a small window into the challenges faced by Korean cultural enterprises at the time.
