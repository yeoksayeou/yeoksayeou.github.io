New Yellow Peril Theory
A liberal-affiliated newspaper in England** published an *opinion* titled "New Yellow Peril Theory." Its main points are:
Japanese cotton cloth (綿布), let alone in the East (동양), has not only taken the markets of India (印度) and England (英吉利), but artificial silk (人造絹) is dealing an even bigger blow. Japan's artificial silk production volume (生産高), which was 9th in the world 6 years ago, became 4th last year, and this year it is again in 2nd place, second only to America (亞米利加). In spinning (紡績) too, regarding export volume (輸出高), 5 years ago England's was 8 times that of Japan, but last year, Japan's was rather (로혀) 3 times that of England. This is because female workers (女工) in England receive wages (賃銀) 8 times that of Japanese, and male workers (男工) 10 times, making competition utterly impossible. <17>

**Summary**

The article reports on a British Liberal Party newspaper's argument labeled the "New Yellow Peril Theory." This theory highlights Japan's rapidly growing economic threat, particularly in the textile industry (cotton cloth and artificial silk/rayon). The British paper claims Japan's low wages (British female workers earning 8x and male workers 10x their Japanese counterparts) make fair competition impossible, allowing Japan to overtake British market share in places like India and even Britain itself. From the perspective of Korean colonial history, this article is interesting as it shows how Japan's industrial might, built partly on the resources and labor of its colonies like Korea, was perceived internationally as a threat, echoing earlier racialized "Yellow Peril" fears but focusing on economics. Historians might find value in how a Korean magazine under Japanese rule reported on Western anxieties about Japanese economic power, potentially reflecting complex sentiments about Japan's role on the world stage.

新黃禍論
영국**의 自由黨系 신문은 「新黃禍論」이란 *說을 실엇다. 그 요지는
일본의 綿布는 동양을 勿論 印度及英吉利의 시장을 빼앗섯을뿐아니라 人造絹은 더욱 큰 타격을 주고 잇다. 일본의 인조견 生産高는 6년전에 세계의 제9위에 잇든 것이 작년은 제4위가 되엇고 금년은 다시 亞米利加의 버금가는 제2위에 잇다. 紡績도 輸出高는 5년전은 英吉利는 일본의 8배엇스나 작년은 로혀 일본은 英吉利의 3배가 되엇다. 이적은 英吉利 女工은 일본인의 8배, 男工은 10배나 되는 賃銀은 밧는 까닭에 도저히 경쟁이 아니 된다 함이다. ＜17＞
