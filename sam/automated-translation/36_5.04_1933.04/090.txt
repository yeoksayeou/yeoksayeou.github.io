Spring Ode
Heo Heon

Heaven and Earth suddenly open wide,
All things meet spring once again.

Nongch'ŏn Sŏ Chŏnghŭi

Misfortune combined with many debts,
Spring is not spring in this place.

Yang Kŭnhwan

Willow branches, first drooping, perceive spring's colors,
Heaven and Earth joyfully, harmonious energy returns.
Men and women, pair by pair, walk hand-in-hand on the road,
Not knowing its meaning, they walk slowly. <13>

**Summary**

This article presents three short poems titled "Spring Ode" (春賦) by different authors: Heo Heon, Sŏ Chŏnghŭi (under the pen name Nongch'ŏn), and Yang Kŭnhwan. Heo Heon's poem offers a grand, positive view of spring's universal arrival. Sŏ Chŏnghŭi's provides a stark contrast, expressing personal hardship (misfortune and debt) that negates the feeling of spring. Yang Kŭnhwan's poem depicts a gentle spring scene with willows and couples walking, but ends on a note of ambiguity or contemplation ("Not knowing its meaning, they walk slowly"). From a historical perspective, these poems offer glimpses into individual sentiments during the colonial period. While nature cycles on (spring arrives), personal circumstances (like Sŏ Chŏnghŭi's hardship) or a sense of underlying uncertainty (implied in Yang Kŭnhwan's ending) reflect the complex realities faced by Koreans under Japanese rule, contrasting the universal theme of spring's renewal with individual or societal struggles.
