Recent News of Notable Women

Dancer Miss Ch'oe Sŭng-hŭi (崔承喜女史) has departed for Tōkyō to enter the Ishii Baku Dance Studio (石井漠 舞踊所) again to further her dance research.

Miss O Yŏp-chu (吳葉舟氏), who is both an actress at the Kyōto Kamata Film Studio (京都蒲田撮影所) and a renowned actress of the Korean stage (朝鮮劇壇), known for her beautiful appearance and abundant talent, has recently opened a beauty salon (美容化粧院) inside the Hwasin Department Store (和信百貨店).

Miss Hŏ Chŏng-suk (許貞淑氏), whose illness (病勢) relapsed, was re-admitted to the Medical College Hospital (醫專病院) from March 15th, but has since been discharged.

Miss Song Kye-wŏl (宋桂月氏) is also quietly recuperating (靜養中) as her illness has worsened (더처).

Miss Hŏ Yŏng-so (許英蕭氏) went to Tōkyō to study for about three years as an auditor (聽講生) at Tōkyō Imperial University (東京帝國大學), and even completed all the procedures (手續), but is said to have returned to Seoul (귀경) because her young child fell ill. <21>

**Summary**

This article provides brief updates on the activities and status of several prominent Korean women in early 1933. It notes dancer Ch'oe Sŭng-hŭi's return to Tokyo for study, actress O Yŏp-chu opening a beauty salon, Hŏ Chŏng-suk's recent hospitalization and discharge, Song Kye-wŏl's ongoing illness, and Hŏ Yŏng-so's return from Tokyo due to her child's illness after arranging to audit courses at Tokyo Imperial University. For historians, this piece offers glimpses into the lives of elite Korean women during the colonial period, showcasing their engagement in modern professions (dance, acting, business), pursuit of education abroad (specifically in Japan), health challenges, and the constraints imposed by family obligations, reflecting the complex realities of navigating modernity under colonial rule.
