Samch'ŏllisa reports <75>

**Summary**

This is a company announcement from Samch'ŏllisa, publisher of the magazine "Samch'ŏlli," celebrating its fifth anniversary in April 1933. The company announces plans to expand significantly by setting up branch offices and sales outlets across Korea and overseas, inviting interested parties to inquire about the terms. For historians, this brief notice reflects Korean private enterprise attempting expansion during the Japanese colonial period, seeking distributors both domestically and abroad. The mixed use of Hanja and Hangul, along with older Korean grammatical forms, is also indicative of the language norms of the time.
