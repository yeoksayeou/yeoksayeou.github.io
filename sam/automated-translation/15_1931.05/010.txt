Dissolution and Prospects

Those with the most demands are the farmers and laborers. According to the most recent survey by the Government-General, farmers constitute 77% of the entire population, and among those farmers, 61% are said to belong to the tenant farmer class. For that reason, movements initiated by tenant farmers themselves have occasionally arisen in places like Yongch'ŏn and Amt'ae, seeking reductions in tenant fees due to wind, flood, and drought damage, and opposing "standing crop seizures" (立毛差押) and "demands for land eviction" (土地明渡請求). Regarding factory laborers as well, there have been movements in various places such as P'yŏngyang Rubber and Pusan Spinning for wage increases, improvement of treatment, and union recognition. Henceforth, as layoffs are likely to increase due to factory closures like the Hoeryŏng Coal Mine and other business curtailments attributed to the economic downturn, the labor-farmer problems will likely take on greater complexity.

How can everyday economic interests be defended and expanded? To do so, it is deemed right to confront challenges with the strength of unity among many people rather than through individual movements. Consequently, the organization of labor unions and farmers' unions is a common progressive trend in various countries. In the recent Diet session in Japan, the submission of a "Labor Union Law" (勞働組合法) was even seen, demanding that the state abolish prohibitions or restrictions on the "workers' right to organize." Following this general trend, many farmers' unions and labor unions have already been organized on the Peninsula. However, it is a fact that the various unions today are in a state of stagnation. How should this be overcome?

We shall refrain from lengthy discussion on this occasion and instead, following the issue of dissolution, look forward with great interest and attention to the movement for the expansion and strengthening of farmers' unions and labor unions, which is poised to become the next issue. (P'ain)<1>

**Summary**

This editorial discusses the dire economic situation of Korean farmers and laborers, who constitute the vast majority of the population, particularly tenant farmers. It notes recent collective actions like tenant fee reduction movements and factory worker demands for better wages and union recognition. Acknowledging the global trend towards unionization, highlighted by proposed legislation in Japan, the author observes that existing unions in Korea are currently stagnant. The editorial concludes by expressing anticipation for a renewed movement to expand and strengthen these farmer and labor unions, positioning this as the critical issue following an unspecified "dissolution" (likely referring to the recent forced dissolution of nationalist/socialist umbrella groups like the Singanhoe). For historians, this article is valuable as it documents the socio-economic conditions and early labor/agrarian organizing efforts under Japanese colonial rule in 1931. It reflects the awareness of labor rights discourses (even referencing Japanese Diet discussions) and points towards the shifting focus of social movements towards class-based organization after the suppression of broader nationalist coalitions.

解消와 展望
가장 要求할 것을 만히 가진 者는 農民과 勞働者들인데 總督府 最近 調査에 의하건대 全人口의 7割 7分까지가 그 農民이오 또 農民의 6割 1分까지가 小作人層이라 한다. 그런 까닭에 龍川, 岩泰等地에 風水旱害에 의한 小作料 輕減運動과 「立毛差押」 「土地明渡請求」의 反對運動이 小作人 손으로 각금 이러낫고 工場勞働者로 말할지라도 平壤고무, 釜山紡績 등 여러 곳에서 賃銀引上, 待遇改善, 組合承認 등을 위한 움지김이 잇서 왓다. 압흐로도 不景氣라 하야 會寧炭鑛과 가치 工場閉鎖와 其他 事業縮小에 因한 解雇가 만허질 듯 함에 따라서 勞農問題는 더윽 復雜性을 띄게 될 것이다.

엇더케 하면 日常의 經濟的 利益을 擁護, 伸長할 수 잇슬가. 그리함에는 個個의 움지김보다 多數人이 團結의 힘으로서 당함이 올켓다 하야 이에 勞働組合, 農民組合이 조직된 것은 各國의 共通된 進步的 傾向이라. 今番 議會에 日本에서는 國家에 「勞働者의 團結禁止 또는 制限을 撤廢하라고 「勞働組合法」의 提出까지 보엿든 것이다. 이 大勢에 따라 半島에도 벌서 農民組合, 勞動組合이 만히 組織되어 잇다. 그러나 今日의 여러 組合은 不振狀態에 드러 잇는 것이 事實이다. 이것을 엇더케 打開할 것인가.
吾人은 여러 말을 함을 이 機會에 避하고 오직 解消問題의 뒤를 이어 問題되려 하는 農民組合, 勞働組合의 擴大强化運動을 만흔 興味와 注意로써 바라보려 한다. (파인)＜1＞
