**Body Text Translation:**
Thanks and Apology

Regarding the "Strategies for Expanding and Strengthening Labor Unions and Farmers' Unions" (勞働組合 農民組合의 擴大强化方略), which should naturally be discussed in connection with the dissolution issue currently sweeping through our press circles, this magazine planned to publish discussions from various figures in society in the May issue through "Our Meeting Place" (我等의 會議場). However, due to pressing deadlines, we could not obtain all the manuscripts from the planned contributors, so we were forced to postpone it. Nevertheless, we intend to discuss it extensively at a later opportunity and hope for contributions from many knowledgeable individuals. <70>

This time, several extremely important essays were subjected to deletion (削除). Due to the editing schedule, we were unable to supplement with other manuscripts and had to publish as is, resulting in this issue being unexpectedly weak, for which we feel apologetic.

As mentioned in the company notice (社告), this summer, this magazine will strive to introduce and observe *Country*, India, and Russia (*國 印度 露西亞).

One thing to announce with apologies: Previously, orders for publications, ginseng (人蔘), etc., were handled by establishing an Agency Department (代理部) and entrusting its manager to respond to your requests. Recently, however, shipments have sometimes been delayed, causing inconvenience to one or two individuals. Therefore, from now on, I (生) will become the direct person in charge and faithfully run errands to meet the readers' requests. Please place your full trust in us and utilize the Agency Department frequently.

Well then, spring is now gone and summer is coming. We hope you all stay well without being overcome by the heat. (P'ain) <71>

**Summary**

This editor's postscript from the May 1931 issue of Samch'ŏlli apologizes for two main issues: the postponement of a planned feature on strategies for strengthening labor and farmer unions due to missed deadlines, and the forced deletion (censorship) of several important articles, resulting in a 'weak' issue. The editor promises to cover the union topic later, announces upcoming features on "*Country*" (unspecified/censored), India, and Russia, and informs readers that the editor will personally oversee the magazine's mail-order service (Agency Department) to prevent future delays in delivering items like books and ginseng. It concludes with seasonal greetings. For historians, the explicit mention of "deletion" (削除) provides direct evidence of censorship impacting Korean publications under Japanese rule. The intended discussion on labor and farmer unions, despite its postponement, indicates the magazine's willingness to engage with sensitive social and potentially political topics relevant to colonial Korean society.
