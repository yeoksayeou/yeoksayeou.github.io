**Body Text Translation:**
World's Smallest Play, "The Exile" One Act
						Original work by French Poet Bernard

Characters: Exile, Village House Owner
Setting: An exile quietly enters a village house near the border.

Exile: "Hello, I don't know who you might be, but please hide me. I am someone sought by the Police (警察). There's even a reward offered."

Village House Owner: "How much is the reward? Let's ask about that first."

The Exile helplessly turns his feet and leaves. - End of Act - <16>

**Summary**

This article presents a translation of what is claimed to be the "World's Smallest Play," a one-act piece titled "The Exile," originally by the French poet Bernard (likely Tristan Bernard). The play depicts an encounter where an exile seeking refuge reveals a reward is offered for his capture. The house owner, instead of offering help, immediately inquires about the reward amount, prompting the exile to leave in despair. From a historical perspective, the publication of this foreign play in a Korean magazine during the Japanese colonial period is noteworthy. Its themes of desperation, betrayal for monetary gain, and moral compromise, though universal, might have resonated particularly strongly with Korean readers facing economic hardship and the complex social dynamics under colonial rule, possibly serving as an indirect commentary on collaboration or the erosion of traditional values.
