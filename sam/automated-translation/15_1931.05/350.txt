Literary Scene March

Novelist Kim Tongin (金東仁) married a flower-like wife on April 17th. For this wedding ceremony, poet An Sŏ (岸曙) and also Ch'oe Sŏhae (崔曙海) traveled from Seoul to P'yŏngyang (平壤) to attend and even served as attendants (들너리). Besides them, Yang Chu-dong (梁柱東) also served as an attendant. Anyway, Mr. Kim's friends greatly emphasize the importance of this marriage, saying his vigorous writing (健筆) truly begins now.

For a while, there were many pure literary magazines focused on poetry, novels, and criticism, such as *Chosŏn Mun'dan* (朝鮮文壇), *Chosŏn Munye* (朝鮮文藝), and *Munye Sidae* (文藝時代), but recently things have become quiet (寂然). A literary scene without pure literary magazines is indeed lonely (寂寞). It is spring. Won't a purely literary magazine emerge in the literary world?

Ch'oe Togyŏn (崔獨鵑) got divorced sometime ago. With this, the writers who have experienced divorce are Ch'unwŏn (春園), Tongin (東仁), Sŏhae (曙海), Illyŏp (一葉), Kim Myŏngsun (金明淳), and now Togyŏn (獨鵑), is that right?

Ch'oe Sŏhae's (崔曙海) father came to Seoul from Puk Kando (北間島) like smoke after more than 10 years, saw his son Ch'oe like smoke, and then headed north again. In the heart (胸裡) of this novelist, experiencing a father-son reunion after 10 years, several long and short stories must have been conceived (構想). Should the father have come, or should he not have come?

Mr. Yŏm Sangsŏp (想涉) is currently abstaining from alcohol (禁酒中), under strict prohibition (嚴禁中) no less, and moreover, refusing visits from drinking buddies (酒友는 面會謝絶中). However, some drinkers are pessimistic (悲觀) about how long this ban (禁制) will last, while others are optimistic (樂觀). Mr. Yŏm Sangsŏp himself, seeing both sides (有無相通) and sorrow and joy as one (悲樂一體), attributes the reason for quitting alcohol to saving consumption (消費節約). Abstinence forced by poverty!?

The *Tong-A Ilbo's* (東亞日報) dispute over literary rights and wrongs (文壇是非) seems to have no particular meaning other than helping young people expose mutual plagiarism (相互瓢切摘發). Being meaningless, its effect (効驗) is also doubtful. If it has come to this...

The *Chosŏn Ilbo's* (朝鮮日報) recent move, calling out loudly to "all famous and unknown writers of the world" under the slogan "Seeking masterpieces (名作) in the world," is welcome news for the stagnant (沈滯) literary scene. Let's create new momentum (機運) quickly. However, conventionally (從來) - and this is definitely not about any specific newspaper company - there has been the bad practice (弊) of announcing a prize contest (懸賞募集) and then, as usual (依例), eliminating the first prize, which carries a large sum, claiming there was no masterpiece (名作), effectively cutting off the head and tail (去頭切尾). Another issue is the tendency for the promised prize money to be delayed by a day or two, paid in monthly installments (月賦), yearly installments (年賦), or even revert (還元) to the "nothingness" that existed before the contest. The literary world must keep watch (監視) and hope such attitudes cease from now on. <71>

**Summary**

This article provides brief updates and gossip from the Korean literary scene in 1931. It covers novelist Kim Tongin's marriage, the recent divorce of Ch'oe Togyŏn (listing other writers who experienced divorce), Ch'oe Sŏhae's brief reunion with his father after a decade, Yŏm Sangsŏp's attempt at abstaining from alcohol allegedly due to poverty, criticism of a plagiarism debate in the *Tong-A Ilbo*, and cautious optimism regarding a literary contest announced by the *Chosŏn Ilbo*, warning against past practices of newspapers reneging on prize money. From a historical perspective, the article offers a candid glimpse into the personal lives, financial struggles, and professional activities (including anxieties about plagiarism and the publishing landscape) of prominent Korean writers under Japanese colonial rule. Historians might find the casual mention of divorces, the reference to Puk Kando (Northern Jiandao), and the commentary on the newspaper contests particularly revealing about social norms and the precarious state of literary production during this period.

文壇行進
小說家 金東仁氏는 4월17일 꼿가튼 夫人을 마지하엿다. 이 結婚式에 서울서부터 詩人岸曙와 또 요한曙海까지 平壤가서 參列하고 들너리까지 섯다. 들너리는 이밧게 梁柱東氏도, 아무튼 氏의 健筆은 이제부터라고 氏의 友人들이 이 結婚을 大端히 重要視.

한동안은 朝鮮文壇 朝鮮文藝 文藝時代 등 詩歌 小說 評論 中心의 純文藝雜誌多種이더니 近來는 寂然, 純文藝雜誌를 가지지 못한 文壇은 亦是 寂寞, 때는 봄이다. 文壇엔 純文藝的 雜誌 안나오나.

崔獨鵑君은 얼마전에 離婚하엿다. 이로써 文人으로 離婚의 經驗이 잇는 이가 春園
東仁
曙海 一葉金明淳 그리고 獨鵑인가.

崔曙海君의 아버지는 北間島로부터 10여년만에 煙氣가치 서울에 왓다가 煙氣가치 아들 崔君을 보고 다시 北行하엿다. 10년만에 父子相會하는 이 小說家의 胸裡에는 長短篇 몃개 小說이 構想되엿슬 듯 아버지는 와야 할 것인가 오지말어야 할 것인가.

想涉氏는 目下 禁酒中 그것도 嚴禁中 더구나 酒友는 面會謝絶中 그러나 이 禁制가 언제까지나 갈가하고 엇든 酒仙은 悲觀하고 엇든 酒仙은 樂觀 本人인 想涉氏는 有無相通 悲樂一體로 술끈는 理由를 消費節約에다 둔다. 가난이 强要하는 禁酒!?

東亞日報의 文壇是非는 어린 사람들의 相互瓢切摘發을 도옵는 以外에 別 뜻이 업는 듯 뜻업자 効驗도 疑問. 已往이면...

「天下에 名作을 求한다」는 슬로-간 아래 「天下의 有無名作家」를 소리처 부르는 朝鮮日報社의 此擧. 沈滯한 文壇에 반가운 소리다. 어서 새 機運을 만들일. 다만 從來ㅡ 이것은 어느 新聞社란 말이 決코 決코 아니다.-懸賞募集을 하여노코는 去頭切尾 依例 賞金이 만히 나가는 一等은 名作이 업슴네 하고 업새버리는 弊와 또 한가지는 준다든 돈을 하로이틀 或은 月賦 或은 年賦 或은 募集前의 「無」에 還元식히는 例가 잇다. 文壇은 監視하야 이제부터 이러한 態度업기를 바라자.＜71＞
