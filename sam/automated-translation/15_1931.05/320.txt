Author: 赤羅山人
Article Type: 시 (Poem)

The twelve peaks of Mount Wu (巫山)
Are like a folding screen of distant clouds;
The blue waters of the Boiling River (沸江)
Were they the mirror used for adornment?
The fairy who descended at Kangsonnu Pavilion
Must have begun her dancing in silken robes.

Who built Kangsonnu Pavilion?
There is no one at all who knows.
Why was Kangsonnu Pavilion built?
Do not ask about the old tales.
Passing travelers like me
Are filled with tears.

In this thousand-year-old capital,
Who built this pavilion?
To those who ask the meaning
Behind the building of this pavilion, I answer:
It was to show
The traces left by people of the past.<65>

**Summary**

This poem by Chŏngnasanjin reflects on the Kangsonnu Pavilion in Sŏngch'ŏn. The poet evokes the mythical beauty of the place, imagining fairies dancing there, contrasting the scenic splendor with the unknown origins and purpose of the pavilion. A melancholic mood pervades the poem, as the speaker acknowledges the passage of time and the loss of history, suggesting the pavilion stands as a silent testament to bygone eras, moving travelers like the poet to tears. From a historical perspective, the poem is interesting as it expresses a sense of nostalgia and loss regarding Korean historical sites during the Japanese colonial period. The lament over not knowing the pavilion's origins and the focus on "traces left by people of the past" could be interpreted as a subtle reflection on cultural identity and historical continuity in a time of foreign domination.

成川降仙樓
						赤羅山人
巫山 12峯은
구름먼츤 병풍이요
沸江 푸른 물은
단장하던 거울이냐
降仙樓 내리신 仙女
舞衣춤을 첫스리.

降仙樓 뉘 지엇노
아는이 전혀 업네
降仙樓 웨 지엇노
녯일을낭 뭇지마소
날가티 지나는 손이
눈물겨워 하노라.

千年 녯 都邑에
이 樓臺를 뉘지엇노
이 樓臺 지은 뜻을
무ㅅ는이게 답하노니
녯사람 지난 자취를
보여주려 함일세.＜65＞
