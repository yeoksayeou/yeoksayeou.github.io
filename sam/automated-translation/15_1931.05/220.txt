Thinking it was her husband

The wife (mananim) of a certain very wealthy household caught a burglar coming into the house, beat him severely, and even knocked out two of his teeth.

Newspaper reporters rushed like clouds to meet this brave woman and praised her courage, but the woman, greatly surprised, said,

"What? A burglar? Oh, the poor thing. Actually, because my husband goes to sleep every night at the house of that wench named Sanwŏl (山月), I was lying in wait, saw him coming in, and gave him a thorough beating!" <50>

**Summary**

This short anecdote recounts how a wealthy man's wife mistakenly beats up a burglar, believing him to be her unfaithful husband returning from his mistress's house (named Sanwŏl). When reporters praise her bravery for catching the thief, she expresses pity for the burglar upon learning the truth, revealing her original violent intent was for her husband. For historians, this piece offers a glimpse into marital conflicts, social commentary (infidelity, the term 'wench'), the portrayal of female agency (albeit through violence) and perhaps the casual, humorous tone sometimes adopted in popular press during the colonial period, even when depicting violence or social issues.
