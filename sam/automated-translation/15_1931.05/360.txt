The Psychology of Unmarried Women (未婚女의 心理)

In a certain Canadian (加奈多) newspaper, an advertisement like this appeared: "Here is the twenty-six-year-old eldest son (맛아들) of a millionaire (萬石꾼), mild-mannered (溫厚) and handsome. I wish to marry a woman like Ch'unhyang (春香) from the novel I wrote, like, say for example, *The Tale of Ch'unhyang* (春香傳)."

Upon doing so, within 24 hours of this advertisement appearing, apparently all copies of that novel were sold out. How many women, both there and here, must be secretly longing to get married? <71>

**Summary**

This short piece recounts an anecdote about a personal advertisement placed in a Canadian newspaper by a wealthy young man seeking a wife similar to the character Ch'unhyang from the classic Korean novel *Ch'unhyangjŏn*. The ad resulted in the novel selling out within 24 hours. The author muses that this demonstrates how strongly women, both in Canada and impliedly in Korea, desire marriage. For historians, the article offers a glimpse into social commentary on marriage desires among women in colonial Korea, drawing a parallel with a Western context. The specific mention of *Ch'unhyangjŏn* as an ideal, even in a fictional Canadian context within the article, underscores its cultural significance during this period.
