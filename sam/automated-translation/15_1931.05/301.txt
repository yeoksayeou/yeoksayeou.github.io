**Body Text Translation:**
Announcement/Apology

Man'guk Puin (萬國婦人) = We intended to publish Man'guk Puin (萬國婦人) with the aim of supporting the women's movement in Korea (朝鮮), but our circumstances do not yet permit its smooth delivery (順産), and furthermore, as there are currently three or four women's magazines, there is concern that if our company's women's magazine were added to these, it would lead to mutual trampling (彼此自相踐踏). Therefore, regretfully (遺憾), we have decided to suspend it for the time being (當分間). Instead, we intend to fill the pages of Samch'ŏlli (三千里) with articles concerning women to meet the expectations of various individuals henceforth.

Popular Vote (人物投票) = Our company planned a hypothetical public nomination (假定公薦) for the Central Committee Chairman of the Sin'ganhoe (新幹會), the President of the Chosŏn Ilbo (朝鮮日報), and the President of the Tong-a Ilbo (東亞日報), and announced this undertaking in the January issue of this magazine this year. We are truly grateful (感謝) that many readers showed enthusiastic support (熱熱한 譛成) and even conducted careful voting (愼重한 投票). However, as you know, the Sin'ganhoe (新幹會) is currently amidst the "Dissolution Issue" (解消問題), and announcing the results before its outcome (歸趨) is decided could easily become an action (擧措) lacking sincerity towards the movement front (運動線上). Therefore, we are changing the scheduled announcement date (豫定의 發表期日) and postponing it for the time being (當分延期), so please understand (諒解).

Modern Literature Complete Works (近代文學全集) = As you may know from the separate company announcement (別紙社告), our company, wishing to greet you all during the high summer (盛夏) of June, July, and August with a highly meaningful gift through Samch'ŏlli (三千里) magazine, has decided to publish special features introducing China (中國), India (印度), and Russia (露西亞). As a result of being busy (奔走한 所致) with this, the planned publication of the ten-volume "Modern Literature Complete Works" (近代文學全集) is postponed until this autumn (今秋). Please understand this deeply (千萬海諒) and we hope for double your previous support (倍前의 愛護).

Samch'ŏlli Company Reports (三千里社白)

**Summary**

This article from the May 1931 issue of Samch'ŏlli serves as a notice to readers about three postponements or cancellations. First, the planned launch of a women's magazine, 'Man'guk Puin', is suspended due to unfavorable circumstances and potential market oversaturation. Second, the announcement of results for a hypothetical leadership poll involving the Sin'ganhoe, Chosŏn Ilbo, and Tong-a Ilbo is delayed because the Sin'ganhoe is debating its dissolution. Third, the publication of a 'Modern Literature Complete Works' series is postponed until autumn due to the company's focus on summer special issues about China, India, and Russia. For historians, this piece offers insight into the challenges of publishing, especially niche magazines like those for women, during the colonial period. It also directly references the critical internal debate leading to the dissolution of the major nationalist coalition, the Sin'ganhoe, revealing the publisher's sensitivity to the political climate. Furthermore, the planned special issues indicate a contemporary interest in other Asian nations within Korea.
