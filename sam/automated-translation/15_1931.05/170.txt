News Snippets

It seems the people's resentment towards Italy's (伊太利) dictatorial politician, Mussolini (뭇소리니), fills the entire nation, as slogans reading "Give us bread. If not, Mussolini's head!" are reportedly posted here and there (處處) on street stone walls. This is according to the talk (談) of a certain Mr./Ms. So-and-so (某氏) who recently returned to the country.

If I Had Eaten You Up

Hyesuk (惠淑): "Hey, look here... Didn't you tell me when we were engaged that you found me so lovely you wanted to just eat me up? Well, you said that then, but..."
Husband (男便): "Really, if I had just eaten you up back then, I wouldn't have this suffering today."<39>

**Summary**

This short article presents two unrelated items: a report on widespread public discontent in Italy against Mussolini, evidenced by anti-Mussolini slogans demanding bread or his life, attributed to a recent returnee; and a brief, dark joke between a wife named Hyesuk and her husband, referencing a past term of endearment. From a historical perspective, the mention of Mussolini indicates Korean awareness of major international political figures and events, even under colonial rule. The joke, while perhaps timeless in its portrayal of marital banter, offers a small window into the humor published for a Korean audience during this period.
