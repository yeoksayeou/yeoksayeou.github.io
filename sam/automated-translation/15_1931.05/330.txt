Courtroom Miscellany, A One-Year Sentence Becomes Acquittal
						Lawyer Yi In

I shall report on a strange, recent case of wrongful conviction that occurred in X-ju, Ch'ungbuk. In the winter the year before last, an operative <66> said to be from Shanghai entered the home of Pak Hong-gyŏng (pseudonym) late at night and took money. Now, this Pak Hong-gyŏng's household was that of a prominent wealthy farmer in the region, reliably producing about 5,000 to 6,000 sŏk [unit of grain volume]. He had two sons. The elder was named Ch'ang-sik (pseudonym), a playboy of about 30, and the younger was In-sik (pseudonym), an uneducated but honest and simple young man. It often happens that a playboy emerges from a wealthy family anywhere, and when one does, it's typical for discord to arise between father and son or for brothers to be estranged, leading to constant turmoil within the household.

The elder brother greatly scolded and envied the younger brother, constantly quarreling. The reason was that the father, Hong-gyŏng, thought carefully; if he were to divide his property and give it to his eldest son according to custom, given his spending habits, it wouldn't last more than a few days. Therefore, he decided to pass the inheritance to his second son and gave the eldest son only a small portion of the assets to set him up independently. Naturally, the elder brother, coveting the fortune, could not look favorably upon his younger brother.

Into this discordant father's house, the incident of an armed Shanghai operative visiting one night suddenly occurred.
However, since this event happened late at night, known only to one person (the father was away at the time, only the younger brother was present), rumors did not spread outside. Then, through someone's anonymous tip (rumors circulated for a while that the elder brother had done it), it became known to the police. Consequently, the younger brother was arrested by the police. However, perhaps due to unavoidable circumstances at the time, his body <67> was released after a few days.

If the matter had ended there, the world would have become quiet again without any reason, but one day, a bizarre anonymous letter arrived at the local police station. It claimed that the X Chief (X長) had deliberately sent the operative to that house that night.
The police were startled and arrested the elder brother, who disliked the younger brother, as the suspect behind the anonymous letter and interrogated him. However, the elder brother insisted he absolutely did no such thing, suggesting that perhaps the younger brother, fearing his own guilt, had staged such a drama, and ultimately did not confess. So, the police had no choice but to give the elder brother a brush and ink and have him write. His handwriting perfectly matched the writing in the anonymous letter. However, since the elder brother denied the facts so vehemently, the police reluctantly summoned the younger brother again. They first gave him brush and ink, just as they had done with the elder brother, obtained his handwriting, and investigated it. Should we call this truly bizarre? The younger brother's handwriting was also exactly like the elder brother's, as if cast from the same mold. And the younger brother completely denied it, saying he had absolutely never sent such an anonymous tip, nor did he have any need to do so, having already been released.
With things becoming so complicated, who could distinguish the truth? The police were baffled for a while, not knowing what had happened.

After many days of investigation, it was truly a case of "it must be on this mountain," <68> but "the clouds are deep, and the location is unknown." The culprit had to be one of the two, but they couldn't determine which one. The police station had no choice but to send both men to court.
However, during the prosecutor's investigation, for some reason, the elder brother was released after just a few days, while only the honest younger brother received a guilty verdict in the first trial, sentenced to either one year or one year and six months.
Feeling unjustly treated, the younger brother appealed. During the appeal trial, I took charge of this case and stepped forward as the defense lawyer.
While going through the various records related to the case, I made a significant discovery. It concerned a letter that the elder brother had sent to the younger brother via the police station attendant (警察署小使) who came to clean, while they were still detained in separate cells at the police station's detention center. The content of the letter, discovered later when "truth eventually prevails" (事必歸正), was:
"Hey, little brother, just say you did this. Since you really didn't do it, you'll surely get out eventually, won't you? Hurry up and say you did it. If you get me released that way, I'll get out and arrange for you to get out safely too."
Although the elder brother routinely disliked the younger brother, the younger brother still had lingering affection for his elder brother. The younger brother thought about it, and the words seemed plausible. From then on, he claimed he had done it, ultimately receiving the sentence of about one year's imprisonment. This letter incident is a certain fact; because of it, the constable on duty at the detention center that night <69> had to write an explanatory report (始末書), and the attendant was also severely reprimanded.
Meanwhile, the elder brother, who had already been released, was arrested again for some fraud (詐欺取財) or similar offense and sent back to the court. While presenting the facts of this situation in my argument, I also reasoned with the younger brother, who, still trying to protect his brother, wouldn't confess that the brother's letter said such things: "Your brother committed a wicked deed and is back in prison. He's going to serve time anyway, so is there any need for you to suffer for a crime you didn't commit?" As a result, he was persuaded to state the whole truth, and ultimately, he was acquitted in the appellate court (覆審法院) and released.
This fact, where a sentence of over a year became an acquittal, should be called a bizarre case of wrongful conviction.
In any case, for those of us who frequent the courts where flawed humans mete out and receive punishment, it is regrettable to know that one can often witness such instances of weeping over wrongful convictions. <70>

**Summary**

This article by lawyer Yi In recounts a case from Ch'ungbuk X-ju where a younger brother, In-sik, was wrongly convicted for sending an anonymous letter implicating a local official. The letter concerned a prior incident involving a Shanghai operative visiting his family home. His elder brother, Ch'ang-sik, resentful over inheritance, actually wrote the letter. Both brothers had nearly identical handwriting, confusing the police. Ch'ang-sik persuaded In-sik (via a smuggled letter in jail) to take the blame, promising to help him later. In-sik was convicted but appealed. Lawyer Yi In discovered the smuggled letter and convinced In-sik to reveal the truth, especially after Ch'ang-sik was re-arrested for fraud. In-sik was acquitted on appeal.

From a historical perspective, the article offers insights into the colonial Korean legal system, including police procedures (investigation of anonymous tips, handwriting analysis), detention practices (smuggled communication), and the court hierarchy (appeal process). The mention of a "Shanghai operative" subtly hints at the political climate and potential anti-colonial activities or suspicions thereof. The family conflict driven by inheritance customs and the portrayal of the "playboy" elder son reflect social dynamics of the time. Most significantly, it highlights the potential for miscarriages of justice within the colonial system and the role of legal defense in challenging convictions, even if the underlying power structures remain.

法廷雜俎, 一年懲役이 無罪로
						辯護士 李仁
忠北 X州에서 이러난 기괴한 최근의 寃罪事實 한가지를 보도하리다. 재작년 겨울에 朴弘敬(假名)의 집에 上海에서 왓다는＜66＞ 단원이 深夜에 드러와 돈을 가저간 일이 잇섯슴니다. 그런데 이 朴弘敬의 집으로 말하면 한 5,600石은 착실히 하는 그 地方有數의 豪農이엇는데 그네게 아들이 둘이 잇슴니다. 兄은 昌植(假名)이라하야 한 30된 남봉客이고 동생은 仁植(假名)이라하야 무식하지만 우직한 청년이엇슴니다. 어느곳에서든지 財産家집에 남봉꾼이 나기 쉽고 남붕꾼이 나면 依例히 그 집안은 父子가 不和하거나 형제가 不睦하여 늘 풍파가 삘사이 업는 것이 例임니다.
그런데 兄은 아우를 대단히 나무레고 시긔하여 늘 말다틈으로 보내엇스니 그 까닭은 아버지되는 弘敬이가 가만히 생각하여보니 제 재산을 습관대로 맛아들에게 논아주면 그 쓰는 솜씨에 불과 몃칠이 못가겟기에 둘재아들의게 상속하여 주고 맛아들을 재산을 조곰 주어서 分家를 식헛슴으로 재산을 탐내는 형의 생각에 동생이 반갑게 보엿슬 이가 업든것이외다.
이러케 不睦한 아버지집에 하로밤은 무기를 가진 상해단원이 단녀간 사실이 돌발하엿슴니다.
그러나 한밤중에 한사람만 알게 이러난 (그때 아버지는 出他하엿고 동생만 잇섯다)이 사실이니 밧갓헤는 소문이 흐르지 안코 잇든 지음에 누구의 밀고로인지 경찰에 알려진바 되엇슴니다. (형이 하엿다는 풍설이 한참 돌앗슴니다) 그래서 동생은 경찰에 검거되엇슴니다. 그러나 그때 경우가 부득이한 사정이 잇섯든지 몃칠만에＜67＞ 몸은 석방되엇섯슴니다.

일이 여기에 끈첫더면 아모 까닭이 업시 세상은 다시 조용하여질 것을 엇든날 그곳 경찰서에는 괴기한 投書한장이 드러 왓섯슴니다. 그것은 그날밤 단원을 그집에 드리어 보낸 것은 그곳 X長이 일부러 그리한 것이라 함이외다.
경찰에서는 놀라 投書의 혐의자로 동생을 미워하는 兄을 붓잡어다가 取調하엿스나 兄은 저는 절대로 그런일이 업노라 혹 하엿다면 동생이 제 죄가 무서우니 그런 연극을 한것이리라하고 終是 자백하지 안엇슴니다. 그래서 경찰에서는 할수업시 형에게 筆墨을 주어 글씨를 씨워보니 그 筆蹟이 올데갈데업는 投書의 글씨엇슴니다. 그러나 형이 너무도 强頑히 사실을 부인함으로 부득이 경찰에서는 다시 그 동생을 불너드러엇슴니다. 그래서 爲先 형에게 하든 모양으로 筆墨을 주어 그 筆蹟을 엇어 조사하여오니 이것이야 정말 怪異千萬이라고 할가요. 동생의 글시도 兄의 筆蹟과 판에 반은드시 꼭 갓해슴니다. 그리고 동생은 나는 절대로 그러한 密告投書를 한일도 업고 또 이미 석방되어나온 몸에 그리할 필요가 업다고 전연 부인하엿슴니다.
일이 이와가치 딱하게되자 누가 엇더케 烏之雌雄을 가리릿까. 경찰은 엇더케 된 인을 몰나 한참 茫然하여 하엿슴니다.

여러날 取調의 끗헤 그야말로 只在此山中이런만＜68＞ 雲深이 不知處라는 말모양으로 범인은 꼭 둘 중에 잇슬 것이나 분간할 수 업서 경찰서에서는 부득이 두 사람을 다 재판소에 넘겨버리고 말엇습니다.
그런데 檢事局의 取調에서 엇더엇더케 된 까닭인지 그 형은 몃칠 안되서 석방되고 우직한 동생만이 1년인가 1년6개월인가 1審에서 유죄판결을 밧게되엇슴니다.
너무 抑鬱하든지 동생은 控訴하엿슴니다. 控訴公判때 나는 이 사건을 마터가지고 변호에 나섯든것이외다.
나는 거기 관계된 여러 기록을 뒤지다가 중대한 발견 한 가지를 하엿슴니다. 그것은 그 동생과 형이 아직 경찰서의 유치장 各房에 유치되어 잇슬 때에 그곳을 掃除하려오는 警察署小使의 손을 거처 형이 동생에게 편지 한 장을 한 일이 잇슴니다. 그 편지내용은 뒷날 事必歸正할 때 발견된 일이지만
「야 동생아, 이번 일은 네가 하엿다고 하여라. 너는 정말 한 일이 업스니 아모래도 나아갈 몸이 아니냐. 어서 네가 하엿다고 그래라. 그래서 나를 방면식히면 내가 나가서 너까지 무사하게 나오도록 주선하여 주마.」
하는 것이엇슴니다. 형은 동생을 日常 미워하지만은 동생은 그래도 형을 생각하는 정이 남어잇섯슴니다. 동생이 생각하여보니 그 말이 그럴듯하여 그제부터는 제가 하엿노라 하여 결국 1년여의 懲役判決을 밧게 되엇든 것임니다. 이 편지사실은 확실한 일로 이 일때문에 그날밤 留置場宿直하든＜69＞ 순사는 始末書까지 쓰고 小使도 톡톡히 책망을 밧엇다 함니다.
그러자 벌서 以前에 석방되어 나간 그 형은 나가서 무슨 詐欺取財인가 하다가 또 붓잡히어 재판소에 送局되어 왓슴니다. 나는 這間의 사실을 드러 변론하는 한편 그래도 형을 앗기어 형의 편지가 그러터라는 말을 자백치 안는 동생에게 「형이 못된 짓을 하다가 또 감옥에 왓다. 어차피 그는 징역살 몸이니 억울한 죄에 너까지 고상할 것 잇느냐.」하고 타일는 결과 진상 전부를 진술하게 되어 결국 그는 覆審法院에서 무죄되어 나왓슴니다.
1년여가 무죄된 이 사실, 기괴한 寃罪라 할것이외다.
엇재든 우리와가치 만혼 인간이 벌을 주고 밧는 그 法廷으로 出入하는 자에게는 이러한 寃罪에 우는 사실을 만히 볼 수 잇슴을 유감으로 암니다.＜70＞
