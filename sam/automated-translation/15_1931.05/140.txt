Lighting Up a Cigarette

When Red Russia (赤露) was established in the West, the Chosŏn Ilbo dispatched Kim Chun-yŏn and the Tong-a [Ilbo] dispatched Yi Kwan-yong; again, when the Chinese Nationalist Government (中國國民政府) was established in the East, the Tong-a [Ilbo] dispatched Mr. Chu Yo-han and the Chungoe [Ilbo] dispatched Mr. Yi Chŏng-byŏn, showing immense vigor in introducing the politics, culture, and various aspects of those newly rising nations.

Have they closed their eyes to the recent, rapidly changing situation in India (印度)? Indifferently overlooking day by day, relying merely on the embellished telegrams that barely pass through all kinds of censorship networks (檢閱網), truly, the recent powerlessness of the private newspaper companies is astonishing, baffling, lamentable!

Was there no travel money for ships and trains? The 100,000 readers have the magnanimity to approve with both hands if asked to pay just 10 *chŏn* more per month for the newspaper price. Can they not afford to pay 10 *chŏn* more than the 1 *wŏn* they used to pay? The crux lies in the passion and courage of the newspaper companies. Is it wrong for us, who know the past well, to propose this today?

The "Korea Products Exhibition Hall" (朝鮮物産陳列舘) has begun construction under the auspices of the Products Promotion Association (物産獎勵會). Please don't just display Ansŏng (安城) brassware, Haeju (海州) inksticks, and Naju (羅州) ramie cloth; also display "those who do no work themselves and, claiming to be from a high place, only watch the general trend for a hundred years" and "those whose theories are twice as strong as their actions, and whose emotions are, again, three times stronger than their theories."

Last autumn, a great harvest; this spring, no seed grain. Is it because the population has increased? Have the horn-spouting scholars rambling on about the population problem belatedly understood?

Respect is due to the Chosŏn Ilbo's magnanimity in offering a prize of 500 *wŏn* and "seeking masterpieces from the world." However, even if there is no first-prize winner, even if there are no masterpieces, that 500 *wŏn* should be thrown towards relief for the poor. There are words within these words (言中有言)!<37>

**Summary**

This editorial critiques the passivity of Korean newspapers in 1931, contrasting their previous enthusiasm in sending correspondents to Soviet Russia and Nationalist China with their current lack of coverage regarding the rapidly changing situation in India. The author laments the newspapers' apparent lack of funds or courage, suggesting readers would willingly pay more for better reporting. The piece satirically proposes displaying unproductive, theory-obsessed individuals at the new Korea Products Exhibition Hall alongside traditional crafts. It also touches upon rural hardship (lack of seed grain despite a good harvest), mocks ineffective scholars discussing population issues, and suggests the Chosŏn Ilbo's literary prize money could be better used for poor relief if no worthy work is found. From a historical perspective, the article reveals contemporary Korean intellectual interest in global anti-colonial movements (India), frustration with censorship and perceived media complacency under Japanese rule, internal social critique targeting unproductive elites, and awareness of economic hardship in the countryside. Historians might find the commentary on media responsibility, the specific events referenced (dispatch of correspondents, the exhibition hall), and the socio-economic observations particularly interesting for understanding the climate of opinion among Korean intellectuals during this period.

담배한대 피여물고
西에 赤露가 건설되자 朝鮮日報는 金俊淵 東亞는 李灌鎔을 또 東에 中國國民政府가 수립되자 東亞는 朱耀翰氏 中外는 李晶變氏를 特派하야 新興하는 그나라 政治 文化 各 방면을 소개하기에 萬丈의 기염을 토하더니,

최근 急角度로 轉變하는 印度情勢에는 눈을 감엇슴인가. 온갓 檢閱網을 통하야 겨우 傳하여지는 電報文의 粉飾으로 그날그날을 泰然看過, 실로 근래의 민간신문사 무기력에는 愕然, 啞然, 哀然!

船車태울 여비업든가 10萬 독자는 한달동안 10錢씩만 신문갑 더 내라면 双手讚成할 雅量잇다. 1圓내든 신문갑을 10錢 더 못낼손가. 要는 신문사의 熱과 용기에 잇다. 과거사를 잘 아는 우리 오늘 이를 제의함이 그른 일일가.

「朝鮮物産陳列舘」이 物産獎勵會손으로 起工, 부대 安城鍮器 海州墨 羅州苧만 진열치 말고 「저는 아모 일 안하고 自稱 高處에서 百年가도록 대세만 관망하는 자」 「실행보다 이론이 倍强하고, 이론보다 감정이, 又 3倍 강한 자」까지 진열하소.

昨秋 大豊, 今春種穀無, 人口느러 이러함인가. 인구문제 云云의 뿔學者 晩覺이나 解得하엿는가.

상금 5백원 던저 「名作을 천하에 구하는」 朝鮮日報襟度敬意에 値 그대신 5백원은 一等업서도 名作업서도 貧民救濟에라도 내던질 일이라 이 말은 言中有言!＜37＞
