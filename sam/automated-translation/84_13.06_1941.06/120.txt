**Summary**

Based solely on the title and author information, this article appears to compile the writings or memoirs of three university students from mainland Japan (Naichijin) – Asakura from the Imperial University (Teidai) and Ichikawa and Anzai from Meiji University (Meidai) – who died in the war (presumably the Second Sino-Japanese War or the early stages of the Pacific War). It presents their personal accounts posthumously. For historians, this article could offer insights into the mentality, experiences, and patriotic sentiments of educated Japanese youth mobilized for the war effort, particularly significant as it was published in a colonial Korean magazine, potentially reflecting wartime propaganda efforts aimed at the Korean populace or showcasing Japanese sacrifice. The absence of the main text prevents a deeper analysis.
