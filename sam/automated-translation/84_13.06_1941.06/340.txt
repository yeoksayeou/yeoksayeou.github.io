**Body Text Translation**
Production Quantity of Korean Films

The number of commercially released films (興行映畵) produced during Shōwa 14 [1939] was 11 films, comprising over 70 rolls. If government-produced films (官廳製作映畵) are added to this, the count reaches 20 films. Furthermore, the total number of feature films (劇映畫) produced in Korea (朝鮮) to date is over 200. Currently, there are 8 films under production. <194>

**Summary**

This short article from June 1941 provides statistics on film production in colonial Korea. It states that in 1939 (Shōwa 14), 11 commercial films were made, totaling over 70 reels. Including government productions, the number reaches 20 for that year. Cumulatively, over 200 feature films had been produced in Korea up to that point, with 8 more currently in production. For historians, this piece offers a quantitative snapshot of the Korean film industry under Japanese rule just before the Pacific War intensified. The distinction between commercial and government films hints at the colonial administration's involvement and potential use of cinema for propaganda or official purposes, while the overall numbers reflect the scale of cultural production despite colonial constraints.
