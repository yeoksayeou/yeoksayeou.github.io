**Summary**

This document outlines the regulations for the Korean Filmmakers Association established in Keijō (Seoul) in 1941. It details the association's structure, purpose, membership requirements (regular, special, sponsor), officer roles (President, Directors, Councilors), meeting procedures, fees, and provisions for member welfare, skill certification, and awards. Notably, Article 3 explicitly states a core purpose is to achieve "Naissen Ittai" (Japan-Korea Unity) through cinema, alongside promoting the art form and filmmakers' skills. From a historical perspective, the explicit inclusion of the Naissen Ittai policy objective (Article 3) is highly significant, revealing how cultural organizations like this film association were expected or required to align with and actively promote Japanese colonial assimilation policies during the wartime period. The requirement for approval from the "competent government office" (主務官廳) for officers (Article 11) further underscores the colonial government's control.
