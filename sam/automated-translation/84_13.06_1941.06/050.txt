**Summary**

[As the article text was not provided, this summary is speculative based on the title and author.]
This article by the Japanese poet Miyoshi Tatsuji likely discusses the life and poetry of the famous Korean wandering poet Kim Sakkat (Kim Pyŏngyŏn). It probably explores the themes of wandering (漂泊, hyōhaku) in Kim Sakkat's life and works, analyzing his poems (likely *hansi*, Chinese-character poetry) and reflecting on his significance as a literary figure. Given the author and the publication date (1941), historians might find this article interesting for its perspective as a Japanese intellectual interpreting a notable figure from Korean folk culture during the height of the colonial period. It could reveal attitudes towards Korean culture, the romanticization of the "wanderer" archetype, or potential attempts to frame Korean figures within Japanese literary or cultural sensibilities.
