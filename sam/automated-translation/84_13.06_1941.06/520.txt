In Chosŏn, because the theatrical exhibition of only foreign films is forbidden, they are all screened together with domestic films (邦畫), and the average screening ratio is 65% domestic films and 35% foreign films. <240>

**Summary**

This brief article notes that in colonial Korea (Chosŏn) as of 1941, regulations prohibited movie theaters from exclusively showing foreign films. Instead, foreign films had to be paired with domestic films (邦畫, likely referring to Japanese or potentially Korean films made within the empire). The average screening time was allocated as 65% for domestic films and 35% for foreign films. For historians, this text provides specific quantitative data on the implementation of cultural control policies by the Japanese Government-General during the late colonial period, demonstrating the mandated restriction of foreign cultural products like movies in favor of promoting domestic ones.
