Chronic Gastrointestinal Illness from Binge Eating and Drinking
						Yi Hak-su (李學洙), Ch'unch'ŏn (春川), Kangwŏn Province (江原道)

As a young man full of vigor (血氣), I did not take care of my body and had a habit of routinely binge eating and drinking (暴飮暴食), leading a life of extreme intemperance (不攝生). Because of this, I damaged my stomach and intestines (胃腸), lost physical strength (體力) and vitality (元氣), my complexion suddenly worsened, and I lost my vigor (血氣). Perhaps because my brain weakened (腦가 弱했든까닭인지), my eyesight (視力) severely deteriorated (減退), approaching blindness (盲目) at 0.1. When reading (讀書), my head felt fuzzy and I experienced dizziness (眩氣), lacking the perseverance to do anything, which put me in a very difficult situation.

When I received a doctor's examination (醫師의 診察), it was the sad diagnosis (宣告) of chronic gastrointestinal catarrh (慢性胃腸가다루).

My elder brother back in the countryside (싀굴兄) heard about this and sent me a bottle of Wakamoto (와까모도) along with a letter (便紙) saying that Wakamoto is quite effective (效果) for illnesses like mine. Having been deceived by various things that didn't work, I thought this would likely be the same, but just in case, I tried taking 6 tablets (錠) after every meal (每日 食後). To my utter surprise, the abdominal pain (腹痛) that had been so severe (甚하든) completely vanished (딱끈처버렸습니다). So I continued taking it, and my health condition (健康狀態) gradually improved, allowing me to recover (恢復) my vitality (活氣). Afterward, my once-weak brain became refreshed (腦가 爽快하여지고), my memory (記憶力) improved, and I started sleeping well at night. <93>

**Summary**

The author, Yi Hak-su from Ch'unch'ŏn, recounts his personal struggle with chronic gastrointestinal illness brought on by habitual overeating and drinking in his youth. His condition deteriorated significantly, affecting his physical strength, complexion, eyesight, and mental clarity. Diagnosed with chronic gastrointestinal catarrh, he skeptically tried the supplement "Wakamoto" recommended by his brother and experienced a remarkable recovery, regaining his health, mental acuity, and vitality. From a historical perspective, this article is interesting as it serves as a personal testimonial, likely functioning as an advertisement for the Japanese product Wakamoto within colonial Korea. It reflects health concerns of the era, the marketing strategies employed, the perceived efficacy and potential reliance on Japanese goods, and provides linguistic data through its use of mixed Hanja-Hangul script and older Korean orthography.

醫師의 診察을 받었드니 慢性胃腸가다루라고하는 슬푼 宣告이였습니다.
이일을 싀굴兄이 알고서 너같은病에는 「와까모도」가 퍽 效果가 있다는 便紙와 함께 「와까모도」한병을 붙여왔습니다만 여러가지 듯지않는것에 속은 저는 이거나저거나 다같다고알면서도 행여나싶어 每日 食後에 6錠식 服用해보았드니 그야말고 놀라웁게도 그처럼 甚하든 腹痛은 딱끈처버렸습니다. 그래서 이어 먹었드니 健康狀態가 점점좋아저서 活氣를 恢復하게되였습니다. 그런 後에 弱하든 腦가 爽快하여지고 記憶力이 늘고 밤잠이 잘오게되였습니다.＜93＞
