Number of American Films Produced in Fiscal Year 1940

Last year in the United States, the films released included 523 feature films (劇) and 707 short films (短篇). The breakdown of sources for the feature films (劇映畫 原作) is as follows:
Original screenplays: 323 (61.8% - 6割 1分 8厘), full-length novels (109), plays (51), short stories (短篇) (21), biographies (傳記) (8), comic strips (『코믹크스코릿푸』) (7), radio programs (4), etc.

Compared to the total of 584 films in the previous year, 1939, this is a decrease of 61 films.

According to a State Department (國務省) announcement, the revenue from 1,515 theaters nationwide (全米) was $673,045. Calculated at an average of 25 cents (仙) per ticket, this indicates that an average family spends $20, and an average individual spends $5, on watching movies (映畵 觀賞).<221>

**Summary**

This short article reports on the number of American films produced and released in 1940, detailing 523 feature films and 707 short films. It breaks down the source material for feature films, noting that original screenplays accounted for the majority (61.8%), followed by novels and plays. The total number of films decreased by 61 compared to 1939. Additionally, it cites US State Department figures on nationwide theater revenue ($673,045 from 1,515 theaters) and estimates average annual spending on movie viewing at $20 per family and $5 per individual, based on a 25-cent average ticket price. For historians, this piece reveals the continued interest within colonial Korea in specific details of American popular culture, particularly Hollywood statistics, even amid increasing wartime controls and anti-Western sentiment propagated by Japan. The use of specific data points (film counts, sources, revenue, spending) and Japanese-influenced terminology (like 割/分/厘 for percentages and transliterations) offers insight into information dissemination and cultural interests during that period.
