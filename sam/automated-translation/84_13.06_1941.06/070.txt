**Summary**

This entry provides metadata for an article titled "From the Taedong River in P'yŏngyang" by the Japanese author Kunikida Doppo, published in the Korean magazine Samch'ŏlli on June 1, 1941. The article is categorized as 'Literary miscellaneous'. From a historical perspective, the publication of a piece by a prominent Meiji-era Japanese writer (though Kunikida Doppo died in 1908, suggesting this might be a reprint or posthumous piece) focusing on a significant Korean landmark (the Taedong River in P'yŏngyang) within a Korean magazine during the height of Japanese colonial rule is noteworthy. It reflects the complex cultural interactions and the presence of Japanese literary figures within the Korean cultural sphere of the time, potentially serving assimilationist goals or simply reflecting shared geographical awareness, depending on the article's unprovided content.
