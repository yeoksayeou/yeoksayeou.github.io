The Problem of Koreans in Manchuria and Governor-General Minami's Firm Promises - 1.5 Million Korean Residents Rejoice
						Shinkyō Shōkakō-jin

Recently, when Governor-General Minami visited Shinkyō in Manchukuo, representing the collective will of the 1.5 million Koreans residing in Manchuria, Messrs.
Kim Tong-man (Manchuria-Korea Daily News executive), Kim Ŭng-du, Pak Chun-byŏng,
Matsuda Kōei, and Kaneko Shōzaburō
earnestly petitioned him regarding the following five issues. In response, Governor-General Minami readily gave his consent, much to the delight of the Korean side, as it meant the resolution of issues pending for several years. Namely:

1.  The issue of guidance for Koreans in Manchuria.
2.  The issue of the treatment of Koreans within Manchukuo.
3.  The issue of education for the children of Korean residents in Manchuria.
4.  The issue of Korean settlement/development.
5.  The issue of unemployed Koreans.

Incidentally, the main points of the questions and answers with the five representatives are recorded below:

1. The Issue of Guidance for Koreans in Manchuria

(Representative Side) Currently, in our Manchukuo, as Your Excellency the Governor-General is aware, there are approximately 1.5 million Korean residents. All are striving equally, demonstrating the spirit of assisting the throne (翼贊精神), to serve the nation. However, the current scope of our lives is truly narrow, and our efforts are not well integrated into the state's administrative offices or other various agencies. Consequently, we cannot fully recognize what the state requires, and although it is not our true intention, the result is that we are currently unable to fully fulfill our sincerity.<30>
Therefore, we request that from now on, some kind of agency or mechanism be established to properly guide us so that we may fully demonstrate our sincerity in assisting the national administration (國政翼贊), and also that the Manchukuo authorities deepen their understanding of the Korean residents. Furthermore, as a related issue, frankly speaking, it is natural for Korean residents in Manchuria to receive treatment as Manchukuo citizens who are also subjects of the Imperial Nation (皇國臣民), and this is also what we desire. However, the current situation is, in some respects, not so; there is a tendency to receive the same treatment as the Han and Manchu peoples of Manchukuo. Therefore, we earnestly request that you give full consideration to this point as well.

(Governor-General Minami) I share your sentiments. This is precisely the problem I have always been concerned about. The mission of my current visit to Manchukuo is also to resolve this issue. Yesterday, I met with the Commander of the Kwantung Army, the Prime Minister, and the Director of the General Affairs State Council, and as a result, I believe a statement from the Army Commander regarding this point will be announced soon.
Therefore, I am confident that these various issues will be resolved in light of the fundamental nature that the 1.5 million Korean residents are also subjects of Japan. All complex problems will move towards resolution based on this premise. The only remaining issue is the problem of unregistered persons (未就籍者). These individuals must register quickly; otherwise, as they are fully subjects of His Majesty the Emperor, there is no alternative but to receive the same treatment as the Han and Manchu peoples. To rectify this, the Government-General of Korea is dispatching about thirty officials under a three-year plan to complete this task, and preparations are steadily advancing.

2. The Issue of Education for the Children of Koreans in Manchuria

(Representative Side) Regarding this issue, we have petitioned Your Excellency multiple times, so we believe you are well aware of it and will not repeat the details here. We wish for this problem to be resolved as soon as possible so that we may not worry about our future.

(Governor-General Minami) As I mentioned earlier regarding the treatment issue, since the fundamental problem has been resolved, I believe this issue will also see a smooth resolution going forward. Furthermore, I think that soon, the governments of Japan and Manchukuo will select committee members,<31> establish a committee, and steadily resolve these matters piece by piece.

3. The Issue of Korean Settlement/Development

(Representative Side) Currently, a large number of settlers are arriving each year as part of the national policy settlement (國策開拓) and are striving to fulfill this mission. However, such group immigration requires vast agricultural land and significant funding and facilities. We request that you encourage smaller-scale migration (分數移民) more, and make great efforts towards stabilizing the farmers who were already here, such as through the establishment of owner-farmers (自作農創定).

(Governor-General Minami) Observing the current situation of Korean farmers in Manchuria, what pleases me greatly is that these people borrow money from the state, produce large quantities of the goods the state requires, and also repay the money without fail. On the other hand, other farmers are not necessarily doing so. In this respect, the trust and expectations the Manchukuo authorities place in Korean farmers are surely significant. Therefore, I hope that Korean farmers will exercise further self-discipline and work diligently so as not to lose this trust. There is a glimmer of hope for the future.
Furthermore, Mr. Nonomiya, the President of Mantaku (滿拓), who directly handles this matter, also has a deep understanding of this issue and I believe shares these concerns. Therefore, I hope that all of you, as leaders of the Korean residents, will occasionally visit such individuals, express your opinions, listen to their desires, and cooperate with them.

4. The Issue of the Unemployed

(Representative Side) Currently, there are quite a large number of unemployed Korean residents in various cities throughout Manchuria, causing various harmful effects. To remedy this, we request that the Government-General of Korea directly establish some sort of mechanism to provide guidance.

(Governor-General Minami) For those who have lost their jobs due to a momentary lapse, I feel sufficient sympathy and am willing to provide assistance. However, for those who are unemployed due to their own laziness, I cannot say I feel sorry for them, and I want you all to guide them with that understanding.

**Summary**

This 1941 article from the magazine *Samch'ŏlli* reports on a meeting in Shinkyō (Xinjing), Manchukuo, between five representatives of the Korean community in Manchuria and the Governor-General of Korea, Minami Jirō. The representatives presented five major concerns: guidance for Koreans, their treatment within Manchukuo (seeking status akin to Japanese subjects rather than merely equal to Han/Manchu residents), education for their children, issues related to agricultural settlement (promoting smaller-scale migration and land ownership for existing farmers), and unemployment. Governor-General Minami expressed agreement on the core issues, promising solutions based on recognizing Koreans as Japanese subjects, mentioning upcoming policy announcements, plans for a joint Japan-Manchukuo committee for education, efforts to resolve the status of unregistered Koreans, and praising the diligence of Korean farmers while urging continued cooperation with authorities like the Manchuria Colonization Public Corporation (Mantaku). He adopted a stricter stance on unemployment caused by perceived laziness.

For historians, this article is interesting as it provides a contemporary glimpse into the stated concerns of (officially sanctioned) Korean representatives in Manchukuo and the Japanese colonial administration's response. It highlights the ambiguous status of Koreans – simultaneously subjects of the Japanese Empire yet facing differential treatment within the puppet state of Manchukuo – and the official efforts to align their status more closely with Japanese subjects, likely to ensure their loyalty and participation in the wartime mobilization ("assisting the throne"). The discussion around settlement, registration, and unemployment reveals the practical challenges and socio-economic stratification within the Korean community under Japanese colonial expansion.

在滿朝鮮人問題と南總督の確約-百五十萬の鮮系國民喜ぶ-
						新京 松花江人
曩に滿洲國新京に赴かれた南總督に向ひ在滿百五十萬朝鮮人の總意を代表して
金東晚(滿鮮日報幹部)、金應斗、朴準秉、
松田光榮、金子昌三郞
の五氏が左記五問題に就て懇に陳情する處があつたがそれに對し南總督は欣然快諾する處あり朝鮮人側ては數年來の懸案解決を見ることになつて非常に喜んで居る即ち
一、在滿朝鮮人の輔導問題
二、在滿朝鮮人に對し滿洲國での取扱問題
三、在滿鮮系國民子弟の敎育問題
四、朝鮮人開拓問題
五、失業朝鮮人の問題
因に五代表との問答要易を記せば

一、在滿朝鮮人の輔導問題

(代表側)現在我が滿洲國には總督閣下に於かれても御存知の通り約百五十萬の鮮系國民があり、皆夫々等しく翼贊精神を發揮して國家に奉公せんと努めて居ります、しかし私達の現在の生活範圍は誠に狹く國家の行政府たとか又は其の他の各機關に於て我等の努力が良く浸透せるを得ず、爲めに國家の需むる處を充分に認識する能はず、それて本意に非ざるも結果に於て誠＜30＞意を十分に果し得ない現狀であります。
それであるから今後は必らず何等かの機關だとか機構を設けて我等をよろしく輔導して國政翼贊の我等の誠を十二分に發揮する樣う致してくれると共に滿洲國當局に於かれても鮮系國民に對しより以上認識を深くして下さることを御願ひ致します。それから之に關聯し た問題として在滿鮮系國民は率直に申して皇國臣民としての滿洲國民たる取扱を受けるのが常然なことであり又我等の要望する處でありますが、現狀は或る點に於てはそうでなく漢滿族の滿洲國と同一なる取扱を受ける傾向もあります故、此の點も充分に御考慮なさつ て下さる樣切に御願ひ申上けます。
南總督 それは同感です、私がいつも心配して居つた問題もこれなのです。今度滿洲國を訪問した使命もこの問題を解決しようとしたのにあります。それて昨日も關東軍司令官を始め國務總理、總務長官とも會見した結果、近くこの點に對する軍司令官の聲明が發表さ れるもと信じます。
從つて之等の諸問題は百五十萬鮮系國民も日本臣民だと云ふ本質に照し凡ての復雜なる問題が解決してゆくものと、確信致します。只問題になるのは例の未就籍者問題であるがこれ等は早く就籍しなければ完全なる皇帝陛下の臣民であるから漢滿族と同一なる取扱ひを受ける外に途がありませね、これを匡正せんが爲め朝鮮總督府の職員を約三十名派遣して三箇年計劃でこれを完了しようとして目下着々準備を進めて居ります。

二、在滿朝鮮人子弟の敎育問題

(代表側) この問題に就いては屢次閣下に陳情したことでありますから良く御存知のことゝ思ひこゝに繰返しませねが、一日も早くこの問題を解決して我等の將來に心配のない樣にして戴き度い。
南總督 先に話した、取扱問題に於て根本問題が解決した以上この問題も今後は順調に解決を見るものと思ひます。又遠からず、日滿兩國政府が委員を選定して＜31＞委員會を設置して着々部分的に解決してゆけるものたと思ひます。

三、朝鮮人開拓問題

(代表側) 目下每年多數の開拓民が國策開拓として入植されこの使命達成に邁進して居るがこの樣な團體移入は廣大な農地と、經費の大い施設が必要でありますが、も少し分數移民を獎勵し、以前に居つた農民の安定の爲めに自作農創定等に就いて大いに努めて戴き度い。
南總督 現在在滿朝鮮農民の實狀を見る時私として甚た喜ばしいのはその人達は國家から金を借りては國家が需むる生産を多量に出し、又その金も間違なく返して居るが、一方他の農民達は必すしも左にあらず、この點滿洲當局の朝鮮農民に對する信用と期持はけたし大なるものがある、これだから朝鮮農民としてはこの信用を失はぬ樣により一層自重して勤勉に働いて吳れることを望みます。將來は曙光が見えます。
それてこの直接取扱者である二宮滿拓總裁もこの問題に對し深い理解もあり又心配して吳れることと思ひます、それであるから鮮系國民の指導者である皆樣も時々それ等の方方をお尋ねして意見も述べ向ふの望みも聞いて協力して下れることを望みます。

四、失業者問題

(代表側) 現在全滿各都市には鮮系失業者が相常に多く、色々な弊害を起しますがこれを救ふ爲め朝鮮總督府より直接何等の機構を置いて輔導して戴き度い。
南總督 一時の過失の爲め、失職した者に對しては充分に同情もし援助しても良いが自己の怠けの爲め失業した者に對しては可愛相たとも云へぬし、皆樣もそう云ふ積りて彼等を指導して慾しい。
