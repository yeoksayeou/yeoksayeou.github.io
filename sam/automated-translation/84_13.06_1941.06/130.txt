**Summary**

[A summary cannot be provided as the main body text of the article is missing.]

Based on the title "Account of Experiences in the National Language Full Comprehension Movement" (國語全解運動體驗記) and the authors associated with Keijō Normal School (京城師範校), the article likely recounts personal experiences of participating in activities aimed at promoting the full understanding and universal use of the Japanese language ("National Language" - 國語) in colonial Korea around 1941. This movement was a key part of the Japanese colonial administration's assimilation policies. Historians might find the article interesting for its firsthand perspective on the implementation of language policy, potentially revealing the methods used, the attitudes of educators (both Japanese, like Okukawa Yoshio, and Korean, like Ha Chung), and the perceived successes or challenges of the movement from the viewpoint of those involved in the colonial education system. The joint authorship itself might offer insights into collaboration or differing viewpoints within that system.
