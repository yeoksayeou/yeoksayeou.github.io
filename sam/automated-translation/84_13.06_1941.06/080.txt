Poem: Watching Choi Seung-hee's Dance
						Noritake Mitsuo

Behind you, even an artificial rainbow drifts.

Your shoulders gentle, you smile.
Choi Seung-hee, you are <58>

Holding a large book called "Mencius" (孟子),
The old man contemplates some tranquility (Mask Dance - 假面舞).

You have become a little thin, but now,
peacefully, as if you have found your hometown.

Your breath (息吹),
The blood flowing surely in you who lives amidst applause (拍車)
is that of the East Asian peoples (東洋の民族).

You dance, as vividly as a demon.
A single Korean woman (朝鮮女).
An elder sister (あねさん).

Deceiving no one,
your good form.

Even the dust rising
from the poorly cleaned stage
is your good accompaniment.

You haven't changed at all from before.

As an hommage (オマージユー) to you,
To be your contemporary
I consider it an honor. <59>

**Summary**

This poem by Japanese author Noritake Mitsuo is an ode to the famed Korean dancer Choi Seung-hee, written after observing her performance. The poet admires her graceful movements, her smile, and her enduring essence, comparing her vivid dancing to a demon's energy. He explicitly links her powerful presence and "blood" to both the broader "East Asian peoples" and her specific identity as a "Korean woman." Despite noticing she seems thinner and the stage is dusty, he sees her as unchanged and considers it an honor to live in the same era as her. From a historical perspective, this piece is significant because it presents a Japanese appreciation of a major Korean cultural figure during the height of colonial assimilation pressure in 1941. The dual emphasis on her "East Asian" and "Korean" identity reflects the complex and often contradictory cultural politics of the Japanese Empire, where admiration could coexist with assimilationist agendas.

						則武三雄
君の背後には人工の虹さへ漂ふを

肩ぶりゆるやかに君(きみ)は笑(え)まふ
崔承喜 君は＜58＞

「孟子」といぶ大きな本を持つて
老人は若干閑寂を思案する(假面舞)

君は少し瘐せた が今
故里をみ出(いだ)したやうにやすらかに
君の息吹(いぶき)
拍車(はくしゆ)の中に生ぎてゐる君に流れる血汐たしかに
東洋の民族だ
君は舞ふ 惡魔ほどにも鮮やかに
一個の朝鮮女
あねさんだ
誰をもあざむかず
君のかたちのよさ

よく掃除してゐない
舞臺に立つほこりさへ
君のよき伴奏だ

君はまへと少しも變つてゐない

君へのオマージユーとして
君と同時代人たるを
光榮とすと＜59＞
