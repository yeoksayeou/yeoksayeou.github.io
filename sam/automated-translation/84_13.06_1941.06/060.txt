**Summary**

This article, published in the Korean magazine *Samch'ŏlli* in June 1941, is a piece of literary (or likely film) criticism by Shigeno Tatsuhiko, a writer based in Tokyo. Titled "Review of 'Homeless Angel' and 'Tuition Fees'," it presumably evaluates two works, likely films given the titles and era. For historians, the article is interesting as it represents cultural commentary by a Japanese critic presented to a Korean audience during the height of the colonial period and wartime mobilization. It reflects the type of cultural content circulating in Korea via popular magazines and highlights the presence and perspective of Japanese cultural figures within the Korean public sphere, potentially discussing Japanese films or works deemed suitable by colonial authorities.
