**Body Text Translation:**
As the times (時局) grow increasingly tense, "National Land Planning and the Population Problem" has resurfaced, stirring up public discussion. At this juncture, we believe that compiling and publishing the treatises of various gentlemen on this issue is a highly meaningful endeavor for the nation's hundred-year grand plan (國家百年之大計).

◇

We are confident that collecting and publishing the "Special Research Papers by Korean University Professors," featuring research treatises from Korean professors holding teaching positions at universities in Tokyo (東京), Kyŏngsŏng (京城), Shinkyō (新京), Peking (北京), and Shanghai (上海), is a monumental achievement unprecedented in our academic world's history. Professor Ch'oe Nam-sŏn's (崔南善) "Eastern Ancient Peoples and the Pulham Theory" (東方古代民族과 不咸論) alone is something this month's issue takes pride in, but furthermore, obtaining Dr. Yi Sŭng-gi's (李承基) treatise on "Synthetic Fiber" (合成機維), which was a target of great astonishment in the world's scientific community, is truly believed to be a great harvest for our culture.

◇

The "Special Feature on Film Culture" (映畵文化特輯), which was even announced to be included in the April issue, is finally being published in this month's issue due to space constraints. We believe this too will be of great help to Korean Film Culture (朝鮮映畵文化) as it embarks on a new movement under the New Order (新體制).

◇

In the literary section as well, we have translated and published poems by luminaries from the poetry scenes of our allied nations (同盟國), Germany (獨逸) and Italy (伊太利). Furthermore, we are also delighted, along with our readers, to be able to publish in its entirety the monumental work of 250 manuscript pages, a dramatization (戱曲化) by Mr. Song Yŏng's (宋影) esteemed pen, of "Kim Satkat" (金삿갓), widely known as a wandering poet of the Yi Dynasty (李朝時代) period. We hope for your enthusiastic reading.＜300＞

**Summary**

This editor's postscript from the June 1941 issue of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine highlights the key features of the current volume. It emphasizes articles addressing contemporary concerns like "National Land Planning and Population Problem" amid the tense wartime situation. It proudly presents a collection of papers by Korean professors from major East Asian universities and specifically mentions Ch'oe Nam-sŏn's historical research and Yi Sŭng-gi's work on synthetic fibers. The postscript also announces the publication of a delayed special feature on film culture under the "New Order" and literary contributions, including translations of German and Italian poetry and a full-length play about the historical figure Kim Satkat by Song Yŏng. For historians, this text reveals the magazine's efforts to navigate and reflect the intellectual and cultural currents of late colonial Korea, showcasing both nationalistic academic pride (Korean professors, historical figures like Kim Satkat) and alignment with the Axis powers ("allied nations" Germany and Italy) and the Japanese colonial "New Order" (新體制) framework, particularly concerning film culture. The mention of Yi Sŭng-gi's synthetic fiber research is also notable, referencing an early stage of the Vinalon invention.

編輯後記
時局이 더욱 緊迫해감에 따라 「國土計劃과 人口問題」가 再燃되여 物議를 일으키는 이때, 이 問題에 對하여 諸氏의 論文을 輯載한 것은 國家百年之大計를 爲해 매우 有意義한일이라생각하나이다.
◇
特히 東京, 京城, 新京, 北京, 上海의 諸大學에서 敎鞭을 잡고계신 朝鮮人敎授諸氏의 硏究論文을 蒐集하여 揭載케된 「朝鮮人大學敎授特別論文」은 我學界有史以來의 壯擧라 自信하나이다. 崔南善敎授의「東方古代民族과 不咸論」하나만으로도 이달 本誌의 자랑으로 삼는바인데, 더욱 錦上添花로 世界科學界에 一大驚異의 的이였던「合成機維」에 關한 李承基博士의 論文을 얻은 것은 實로 우리 文化의 큰 收獲이라 믿나이다.
◇
四月號에 실리기로 豫告까지 하였던「映畵文化特輯」은 紙面關係로 今月號에 드디여 發表케 되었으며, 이 亦是 新體制下에 새로운 움지김을 갖이고 出發하는 朝鮮映畵文化를 爲해 큰 도음이라 생각하나이다.
◇
文藝欄에 있어서도 同盟國인 獨逸詩壇과 伊太利詩壇의 巨星의 各詩을 飜譯하여 揭載하였다오면 李朝時代의 放浪詩人으로 그이름이 널리 알려진 「金삿갓」을 宋影氏의 鹿筆로 戱曲化한 全作二百五十枚의 巨篇을 全載케되었음을 또한 讀者와함께 기뻐하며, 및 熱讀을 바라나이다.＜300＞
