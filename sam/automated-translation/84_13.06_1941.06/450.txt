**Body Text Translation:**
Establishment of "Film Actor School" in Mainland Japan to Improve the Quality of Film Actors
Initiated by Kikuchi Kan, Kishida Kunio, etc.

Since the Film Law (映畵法) was institutionalized, film has come to be counted as one of the important national cultural assets. However, compared to European and American films, it is said that Japanese films still lag far behind. Citing the decline in the quality of film actors as one cause, Kikuchi Kan, Taisei Yokusankai (大政翼贊會) Cultural Department Director Kishida Kunio, Greater Japan Film Association (大日本영화협회) Standing Director Karasawa Toshiki, and others have planned and decided to establish a "Film Actor School."

Conventionally, although each film company in Mainland Japan (內地) has had actor training centers (양성소) and has nurtured new talent, from a cultural perspective (문화적 견지), they are all considered zero. Therefore, a full-scale school will be established to provide actors with a sufficient understanding of Japan's history, culture, and mission. The qualification requirements for recruited students are roughly a professional school (전문학교) graduation level for men and a middle school (중학교) graduation level for women. The establishment is planned for this April. <222>

**Summary**

This article reports on the planned establishment of a "Film Actor School" in mainland Japan (Naichi), initiated by prominent figures like Kikuchi Kan, Kishida Kunio (head of the Cultural Department of the Taisei Yokusankai), and Karasawa Toshiki (of the Greater Japan Film Association). The school aims to address the perceived low quality of Japanese film actors compared to Western counterparts by providing proper training, including education on Japanese history, culture, and national mission, following the implementation of the Film Law. Eligibility requires professional school graduation for men and middle school graduation for women. Historically, this article reveals the Japanese state's increasing involvement in cultural production, specifically cinema, framing it as a "national cultural asset" under the Film Law. The involvement of the Taisei Yokusankai (Imperial Rule Assistance Association) highlights the project's connection to wartime mobilization and ideological control. Reporting this plan for a school *in Japan* within a Korean magazine underscores the colonial dynamic, positioning Japan as the cultural center and model for Korea to follow, aiming to integrate all parts of the empire under a unified cultural and political mission.

映畵俳優의 素質 向上을 爲해 內地에 『映畵俳優學校』 設立
菊池寬·岸田國士 等 發起
映畵法이 制度되여 영화는 중요한 국민 문화재의 하나로 손꼽게 되였으나 歐米영화에 비교하면 아직도 뒤떨어짐이 많다 하여 그 원인 중의 한가지인 영화배우의 소질의 저하를 향상시키기 위해 菊池寬, 大政翼贊會 문화부장 岸田國士씨는 재단법인 大日本영화협회 상임이사 唐澤俊樹씨 等과 企圖하여 「영화배우학교」를 설립하기로 하였다. 종래 內地에도 각 영화회사에 배우 양성소가 있어서 신인을 양성해 왔으나 문화적 견지로 보면 모두 零이기 때문에 본격적인 학교를 설립하여 일본의 역사, 문화 사명에 충분한 이해를 갖게 하고, 모집 생도의 자격은 남자는 전문학교 졸업 정도, 여자는 중학교 졸업 정도며, 설립은 금년 4月 중이라 한다.＜222＞
