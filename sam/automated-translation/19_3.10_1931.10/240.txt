Article Type: Special Issue Introduction (특집호 소개)

<1>
Recently, within the Kyŏngsŏng (京城) literary world (文壇), the writer Yi Sang (李箱) has become the subject of much discussion. Pak T'aewŏn (朴泰遠) and Kim Kirin (金起林) have compared him to the senior poet Chŏng Chiyong (鄭芝溶), saying, "If Chŏng Chiyong is a writer who polishes sensory expression using his innate poetic sensibility, then Yi Sang is a writer who uses his intellect to consciously refine language." This statement, in its own way, seems to aptly describe Yi Sang.

Whatever the case may be (엇더튼), the fact that Yi Sang stands out with a unique brilliance (異彩) within the current Chosŏn (朝鮮) literary world is undeniable. Of course, regarding Yi Sang, there have been various opinions; some praise him as a genius (鬼才), while others dismiss his works as strange creations (怪作) that are difficult to understand. However, it is an undeniable fact that he is a rising writer (新進作家) who has garnered significant attention recently. Whether his works are strange creations or not, the fact that he holds a special position cannot be denied.

Suffering from illness (病苦), Yi Sang recently returned home and is currently recuperating. At this time, our magazine has prepared this special issue to provide readers with material to understand him better. Through this special issue, we hope readers will gain a deeper understanding of Yi Sang, the person, and his literature. We sincerely wish for Yi Sang's speedy recovery and hope he will present even better works to our literary world in the future. This special issue primarily features contributions from writers who are close friends (親交) of Yi Sang. We believe there could have been many more diverse accounts and writings about him. Please understand that this selection was unavoidable due to various circumstances. We hope readers will enjoy reading this. (Editor)

**Summary**

This editorial introduces a special issue of the magazine *Samch'ŏlli* dedicated to the writer Yi Sang, acknowledging him as a prominent and controversial figure in the Kyŏngsŏng literary scene of 1936. It notes comparisons made by fellow writers Pak T'aewŏn and Kim Kirin, highlighting Yi Sang's intellectual approach to language versus Chŏng Chiyong's sensory focus. While acknowledging the debate over whether Yi Sang is a genius or merely produces "strange works," the piece affirms his unique importance and rising status. The editors mention Yi Sang's recent return home due to illness and express hope for his recovery and future contributions, presenting the special issue, comprised mainly of writings by his close friends, as a means for readers to better understand the man and his work. For historians, this piece reveals the active intellectual and literary debates occurring in colonial Korea, the emergence and reception of modernist writers like Yi Sang, and the specific dynamics within the Kyŏngsŏng literary circle. It also provides context for Yi Sang's personal circumstances (illness) impacting his career, reflecting the often-precarious lives of artists during that period.
