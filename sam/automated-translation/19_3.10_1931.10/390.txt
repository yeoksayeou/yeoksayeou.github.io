Song of Beating Clothes

Startled awake by the *ttodeurak ttodeurak* sound,
Was it from sleeping curled like a shrimp? A shiver runs through me.<98>
The lamp stands alone, its light bright,
*Doridakttak*, nearby, only clothes are being beaten.

Opening the window listlessly, a white moon in the sky,
It's the eighteenth day, night has already fallen.
*Doridakttak*, whose clothes are they beating so?
Could they be for the absent beloved, wandering far from home?

Autumn too must be late now,
The whistling wind seeps into the body.
A wife in name only, my heart is a widower's,
*Ttodeurak ttodeurak*, new sorrows arise.

Winter will soon arrive,
But the one to wrap this body in new clothes,
Where does she wander? Only indifferent dreams,
Come and go, night after night, circling in vain.

On the Roadside

An old man, weary on the street, was resting,
Hearing a commotion, I looked, and a car was coming.
"If I could just take that car, Seoul is five hundred *ri* away,
I could get there in one breath, but money is the enemy."

"Please get in the car, sir, it's empty too."
The driver, how kind, spoke gently.
The old man, so overjoyed, climbed aboard, and then,
Astounding! This vehicle, it was a hearse (영구차).

Living Because One Cannot Die

The lament, "I live because I cannot die,"
Should one just hear it with ears and see it sadly with eyes?<99>
Experiencing it, one understands this wretched life,
More painful than death, why does one live?

Though it's a life lived because one cannot die,
Just because one lives because one cannot die, as it is,
Is there a way to discard it? Still, in this life,
Drinking its bitter dregs (게자꾹), one carries on.

"I can't live," "I'll die," though all may cry,
What can be done? As I cannot abandon this life,
Especially when young, it feels too precious,
Again, thoughtfully, one seeks a way to live earnestly.

Though I beat my chest, saying "I live" or "I die,"
Days pass, one after another, seasons change,
Saying even simple meals (약식) are tasteless, mixing them with honey,
One tries to spend this one life with a smile. <100>

**Summary**

These three poems by Kim An-sŏ capture feelings of loneliness, poverty, and the harsh realities of life. "Song of Beating Clothes" expresses the sorrow of separation and longing through the sound of laundry beating. "On the Roadside" presents a darkly ironic vignette of an old man's desperate wish for travel contrasted with the grim reality of his offered ride in a hearse. "Living Because One Cannot Die" delves into the despair and struggle for survival, ultimately finding a reason to persevere despite immense hardship. From a historical perspective, the poems reflect the widespread poverty, displacement, and sense of disillusionment potentially experienced by Koreans under Japanese colonial rule in the early 1930s. The themes of separation, the stark contrast between desire (travel) and reality (hearse), and the grim determination to live despite suffering offer historians glimpses into the emotional landscape and social conditions of the time.

檮衣詞
또드락 또드락에 놀내 눈뜨니
새우잠을 잔 탓가 몸서리 나네＜98＞
등불은 혼자로서 빗이 밝은데
도리독딱 이웃선 옷만 다듬네

무심히 창을 여니 하늘엔 흰 달
열여드래 오늘은 밤도 든 것을
도리독딱 뉘 옷을 저리 다듭나
집을 떠나 나도는 님의 것일가

가을철도 인제는 느즌 탓이리
우수수 부는 바람 몸에 숨이네
안해라곤 이름뿐 맘은 홀아비
또드락 또드락에 새 시름 듯네

치위도 얼마 안해 닥처오련만
새옷으로 이 몸을 싸줄 사람은
어듸를 헤매는가 무심한 꿈뿐
오락가락 밤마다 헛되히 도네

길까에서
길거리에 고단해 쉬든 늙은이
요란킬래 들보니 자동차 오네
「저 차를 탈말로야 서울 오백리
단숨껼에 갈 것을 돈이 원수라」

「차 타고 가시지요 차도 비엿소」
운전수 고마워라 은근한 말에
늙은이 하도 깃버 올으고 보니
기막히네 이사람 영구차라니
-1931.7.26-

죽지 못해 산다고
죽지 못해 산다고 탄식는 말울
귀로 듯고 눈설게 보아 될 것가＜99＞
당해보니 알 것이 몹쓸 이 목슴
죽엄보다 괴론걸 뭐라 사는고

죽지 못해 산다는 목슴이건만
죽지 못해 산다고 그저 그대로
버릴 길야 잇는가 역시 이 생의
게자꾹을 마시며 지내는 것을

못살겟다 죽겟다 모다 울어도
엇지하나 이 못슴 안지고 보니
더구나 젊은 몸엔 앗갑고 보니
다시 곰곰 살틀이 살길을 찻네

내 사노라 죽노라 가슴을 처도
하로이틀 때가고 철이 옴기니
약식도 맛업다고 꿀을 개여서
이 한 생을 웃으며 보내랴드네 ＜100＞
＜98-100＞
