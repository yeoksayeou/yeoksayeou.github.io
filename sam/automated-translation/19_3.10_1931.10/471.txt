Calling the Ten Million Sisters of the Peninsula
○ Hello, mothers of Chosŏn, daughters of Chosŏn! From today onwards, let us beautifully, splendidly, and 감가게(?) adorn our society with our own hands. Since we are living anyway, shouldn't we live well?

○ Hello, mothers of Chosŏn, daughters of Chosŏn! The magazine *Samch'ŏlli* has already been striving for three years to beautifully adorn our society. However, as it was regrettable that it always tended to be male-oriented, starting next month, we have decided to specially establish a "Man'guk Puin" (Women of All Nations) section for the ten million women. Originally, we intended to launch "Man'guk Puin" as an independent women's magazine, but considering that the wife simply picks up and reads the book her husband was reading, and the husband simply picks up and reads the same book his wife was reading, which, on a small scale, would foster greater family peace, and on a large scale, would have the effect of delivering human civilization more convergently, we have decided to combine them for the time being.

○ Hello, mothers of Chosŏn, daughters of Chosŏn! Please stop your needlework for just a moment. Please put down your laundry bat for just a moment. No matter how urgent things are, shouldn't you know how Chosŏn is faring, and whether the neighbors are butchering a cow or a chicken? Our magazine will inquire into these things for you. Furthermore, we will show you what kind of fabrics are currently fashionable on Chongno in Sŏul, methods for birth control, ways to raise young children well, and, on a larger scale, the overall issues of the women's movement. Come now, let us become sisters and brothers of one household through the magazine *Samch'ŏlli*. Let us become grandmothers and grandfathers of one household.

編輯內容 (Editorial Content)
Current Status of Women's Movements in All Nations. Political, Economic, and Social Affairs within Chosŏn, Activities of Prominent Women and Trends in Women's Organizations, Women's Literary Circles, Family Child-Rearing Advice, and Other Miscellaneous Content Abundantly Included.
○ This Content, This Volume Surpasses Independent Women's Magazines!
○ Accordingly, *Samch'ŏlli* Greatly Increases Page Count, Yet the Price Remains the Same at Twenty Chŏn.
Combined Publication Realized Starting from the Upcoming November Issue of Samch'ŏlli.

처음엿줍는인사 (First Greeting)
◇婦人記者 崔貞熙 (Woman Reporter Ch'oe Chŏnghŭi)
○ Before calling the women of China, Japan, or India, I first call upon the many elder sisters residing on the peninsula. Because blood is thicker than water. And because we are all beads threaded on the same string.

○ From now on, through *Samch'ŏlli* each month, I will laugh and cry together with you all. Whether weeping or laughing, shouldn't we do it all for the sake of Chosŏn's female society?

○ Please scold me much for my lack of talent, please encourage me much for my lack of spirit, and while offering even a bowl of warm water to me who lacks sincerity, please allow me to fulfill the mission of this crucial "Man'guk Puin" section. Just as "Man'guk Puin" will grow among you, I too shall grow.

○ Is not the banner of the women's section to encourage liberation for the old-fashioned women bound by feudal tethers, unable to escape, and furthermore, at this time when class differentiation is rapid, shouldn't even we women, said to be weak, possess a class ideology (게급적이데오로기) and exert even our meager strength to assist the comrades who suffer and fight on the front lines? Of course, I intend to publish many articles on such issues. I only hope you will offer constant (부절의) warnings should there be any deviations. That is all. <121>

**Summary**

This editorial announces the launch of a new section, "Man'guk Puin" (Women of All Nations), within the *Samch'ŏlli* magazine, starting from the November 1931 issue. The magazine acknowledges its previous male bias and aims to cater to its ten million female readers by covering international and domestic women's movements, politics, economics, prominent women, fashion, child-rearing, birth control, and women's literature, all while keeping the price the same despite increased pages. The rationale for merging it into the main magazine rather than creating a separate one is cited as promoting family harmony and efficient delivery of content. It includes an introductory greeting from the new Woman Reporter, Ch'oe Chŏnghŭi, who expresses her commitment to Chosŏn's women, asks for guidance, and explicitly states the section's aim to promote women's liberation from feudal constraints and encourage class consciousness and solidarity among women during a time of rapid class differentiation.

Historians might find this article interesting for several reasons. It highlights a conscious effort by a mainstream colonial-era magazine to engage female readership, reflecting changing social dynamics and the burgeoning women's movement. The specific topics mentioned (fashion, child-rearing, birth control, women's movements) provide insight into contemporary concerns. Ch'oe Chŏnghŭi's introduction is particularly notable for its explicitly progressive, even leftist, language ("class ideology," "comrades," "front lines"), suggesting an attempt to push boundaries within the limitations of colonial censorship and pointing towards the intersection of feminism and socialist ideas in 1930s Korea. The justification for combining the sections also subtly reflects economic realities and perhaps a strategy to make potentially progressive content more palatable by integrating it into a general interest magazine read by both men and women.
