**Body Text Translation:**
<25>
Last year, the Government-General of Chosŏn (조선총독부) proposed the Rural Development Movement for the economic revival and spiritual enlightenment of rural villages. This movement is primarily being implemented through the provincial government offices in each province, and its purpose is to improve the lives of Korean farmers and inspire a spirit of self-reliant rehabilitation (자력갱생).

Concrete measures of this movement include improving agricultural techniques, encouraging side businesses, promoting savings in consumption, and fostering praiseworthy customs (미풍양속). In particular, solving the problem of farm household debt has emerged as an urgent task. The Government-General authorities are expanding low-interest loans through local Financial Associations (金融組合) and striving to reform the excessive spending habits of farmers.

However, some quarters also raise criticism that this movement is an extension of colonial rule and aims at maintaining the system rather than fundamentally solving agricultural problems. A farmer from P'yŏnganbuk-to (平安北道) expressed in an interview, "Life is still difficult, and true self-reliance is far off (요원하다)." Nevertheless, the government-led (관 주도) movement continues, and there are also reports that it is achieving some initial results (소기의 성과) in certain regions. Whether the Rural Development Movement will succeed depends on future developments (추이). The long-term impact this movement will have on Korean rural society requires attention.

**Summary**

This article discusses the Rural Development Movement initiated by the Japanese Government-General of Korea in 1930. It outlines the movement's goals—economic revival, spiritual enlightenment, improving farmers' lives, and promoting self-reliance—and its methods, such as agricultural improvements, side businesses, savings, and addressing farm debt via Financial Associations. While acknowledging official efforts, the article also notes criticisms that the movement is a tool of colonial control rather than a genuine solution and quotes a farmer expressing skepticism about achieving true self-reliance. The ultimate success and long-term impact remain uncertain. For historians, the article reveals the dual nature of colonial development policies: presenting efforts for modernization and welfare while facing skepticism about their underlying motives and effectiveness in genuinely empowering the colonized population. It highlights the top-down approach of colonial administration and the gap between official narratives and the lived experiences of some Koreans.
