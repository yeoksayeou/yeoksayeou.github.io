Author: 金昶濟
Article Type: 시 (Poem)

At Kanggwan Pavilion, overlooking the flowing river,
The scenery of two countries (兩國) gathered in a single glance.
For thirty years, this has been my long-held wish;
From two thousand *li* away, I alone have sought this place.
Short and long rivers and marshes return to the Tumen (圖們);
Low and towering peaks and ranges connect to Paektu (白頭) Mountain.
Heaven's treasures (天寶) and Earth's spirit (地靈) are all a magnificent view;
People of the world, do not laugh at my leisurely wandering (閒遊).

(July 2nd, Hoeryŏng, Osan Park)

**Summary**

This Hanja poem by Kim Ch'ang-je describes the profound experience of finally visiting Kanggwan Pavilion in Hoeryŏng, a place he had longed to see for thirty years. From the pavilion, located in Osan Park, he takes in the panoramic view encompassing the Tumen River and the landscapes of "two countries" (Korea and likely China/Manchuria). He marvels at the geography, where waterways flow into the Tumen and distant peaks connect towards Paektu Mountain, considering the scene a magnificent manifestation of nature's treasures and spirit. The poem concludes by asserting the value of his "leisurely wandering" against potential dismissal by others. For historians, the poem offers a glimpse into Korean sentiments during the colonial period, expressing a deep connection to the national landscape, particularly the significant border region near Paektu Mountain, despite the political situation. The reference to "two countries" viewed from the Korean side is also notable contextually.
