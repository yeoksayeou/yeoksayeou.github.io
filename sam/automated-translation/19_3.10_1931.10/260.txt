The agrarian problem in Chōsen (朝鮮) has become increasingly serious. Of course, this did not just begin now, but it has drawn particular attention since last year's poor harvest. The situation is truly precarious, with frequent tenant farmer disputes erupting in various regions and owner-farmers increasingly abandoning their land. The Government-General (總督府) is stepping up its Rural Development Movement (農村振興運動), but it seems they have yet to find adequate countermeasures for the urgent problems at hand.

The tragic situation in northern Chōsen is especially hard to bear. Tragedies stemming from food shortages among residents are reported from the Kankyōdō (咸鏡道) area, and the situation is said to be similar in Heian'dō (平安道). The existence of a large number of farmers on the brink of starvation is a grave issue for the future of the peninsula. The government must implement swift relief measures to prevent further worsening of the situation.

Meanwhile, within Keijō (京城) city, some signs of New Year's prosperity can be seen, with department stores showing liveliness, but this is merely superficial. The lives of the vast majority of citizens remain difficult. Prices are gradually showing an upward trend, putting pressure on the household finances of the common people. This contrast likely illustrates one aspect of the contradictions faced by modern Chōsen.

Labor issues also cannot be overlooked. In port cities like Fuzan (釜山) and Jinsen (仁川), the unemployed overflow into the streets, creating a situation that could potentially become a public order problem. The Government-General needs to devise fundamental solutions for these urban problems as well. Mere stopgap measures will likely not improve the situation.

Recently, the trends in the so-called "Cultural Movement" (文化運動) are noteworthy. There is a movement, centered around some intellectuals, to re-examine Chōsen's unique culture. While this is an interesting phenomenon as an expression of national consciousness (民族意識), the Government-General authorities seem wary of this and are closely monitoring the situation. This is likely due to the judgment that excessive nationalistic tendencies are unacceptable given the current times (時局柄).

Furthermore, in the education world, the thorough dissemination of the Japanese language is being emphasized even more. Strengthening national language (國語 - Japanese) education in elementary schools (普通學校) is one of the Government-General's important policies. However, it is also a fact that this, on the other hand, leads to a decline in the status of the Korean language, harboring delicate issues in the field of education.

Overall, the situation on the peninsula greeting the New Year of Shōwa 10 (1935) still harbors many difficult problems. Rural exhaustion, urban unemployment issues, and conflicts surrounding culture and education. One cannot help but pay close attention to how these will unfold going forward.

**Summary**

This commentary from January 1935 paints a bleak picture of Chōsen (Korea) under Japanese rule. It highlights the deepening agrarian crisis, particularly severe in the north following bad harvests, leading to widespread hardship and land abandonment despite the Government-General's Rural Development Movement. Urban areas like Keijō show superficial prosperity, masking unemployment (especially in port cities like Fuzan and Jinsen) and rising living costs. The article also notes a burgeoning "Cultural Movement" among intellectuals aimed at re-evaluating Korean culture, which authorities view with suspicion, alongside intensified efforts to promote Japanese language education at the expense of Korean. For historians, this piece is interesting as it candidly portrays the economic distress (rural and urban), the socio-economic contradictions within the colony, and the underlying tension between Japanese assimilation policies (language education) and nascent Korean cultural nationalism, all from a contemporary Japanese perspective.
