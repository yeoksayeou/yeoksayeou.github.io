<68>

A friend came to visit me yesterday evening. He asked about this month's literary review. I hadn't even started writing it yet. So, I replied that I hadn't written it yet and asked him what was up. He said that a writer he knows came to him and asked if I was going to write a review this month. This writer supposedly said that if I was going to write it, he wanted to ask me not to write about his work.

He has published quite a few pieces, but I have never once written about his work. Even if I had tried to write about it, I couldn't have. This is because, although he is a writer, I have never read his work, not even once. It's not that I haven't read it because I dislike him. It's just that I have never had the chance to read his work. A few days ago, I went to the bookstore and bought several magazines. I skimmed through them, but I didn't see his work. So, it seems his work was not published in the magazines I bought. Therefore, even if I wanted to write about his work this month, I couldn't.

However, even if I had read his work, I wouldn't have been able to write about it. This is because he asked me not to write about it. I don't know why he asked me not to write about it. Perhaps he thought that if I wrote about his work, I would only write bad things about it. If that's the case, he is mistaken. I am not the kind of person who only writes bad things about others' work. If there is something good, I write that it is good, and if there is something bad, I write that it is bad. I don't know if he dislikes having bad things written about his work. If that's the case, he should try not to write bad works. It's unreasonable to publish a bad work and then ask people not to say it's bad.

If he asked me not to write about his work because he thought I would only write bad things, he is greatly mistaken. However, perhaps that is not the reason. Perhaps he dislikes being talked about by others, whether good or bad. If that's the case, he is also mistaken. If you publish a work, you should expect others to talk about it. If you don't like that, you shouldn't publish your work. Publishing a work and then asking people not to talk about it is also unreasonable.

Perhaps that is not the reason either. Perhaps he thinks that I am not qualified to critique his work. If that's the case, he is also mistaken. Whether I am qualified or not is not for him to judge. Even if I am not qualified, I can still critique his work. Just as anyone can talk about politics, even if they are not politicians, anyone can talk about literature, even if they are not literary critics. If he doesn't like my critique, he doesn't have to listen to it. But he cannot stop me from critiquing.

Whatever the reason, his request is unreasonable. However, since he asked me not to write about his work, I will not write about it. Even if I had read his work and found something to write about, I would not write about it. This is not because his request is reasonable, but because I want to respect his wishes. However, I must say this. If he continues to publish works, I will eventually read them. And if I read them, I will eventually write about them. I cannot promise not to write about his work forever. I hope he understands this.

Anyway, since I haven't read his work, I have nothing to write about it this month. I also haven't read many other works. The magazines I bought a few days ago are still sitting on my desk. I've only skimmed through them. I haven't had time to read them carefully. I've been busy with other things. What things? It's embarrassing to say, but I've been busy playing baduk (바둑).

I have recently become fascinated by baduk. I learned how to play baduk a long time ago, but I haven't played it much. But recently, I started playing it again, and I found it very interesting. So, I've been playing baduk every day. I play baduk with my friends, and I also play baduk by myself, studying baduk problems. I've neglected my work because of baduk. I haven't been able to read books, and I haven't been able to write. This literary review is also being written in a hurry because I've been playing baduk.

I must quit baduk. Baduk is not helpful for my life. It only wastes my time and hinders my work. I must quit baduk and return to my work. I must read books diligently and write diligently. I must write this literary review diligently as well.

However, quitting baduk is not easy. Baduk is too interesting. When I sit in front of the baduk board, I forget everything else. I only think about baduk. How can I win this game? What is the best move? I concentrate all my energy on baduk. This is why baduk is interesting.

But this is also why baduk is harmful. Because I concentrate all my energy on baduk, I cannot do other things. I must quit baduk. I must quit baduk starting tomorrow. No, I must quit baduk starting today. After finishing this manuscript, I will put away the baduk board and baduk stones. And I will not look at them again.

Will I be able to do that? I'm not confident. But I must try. I must quit baduk for my work and for my life.

I should stop writing such useless things and get back to the main topic. The main topic is the literary review. But as I said earlier, I haven't read many works. So, I don't have much to write about. I will briefly write about a few works that I have read.

**Summary**

This text is a postscript to Yi Kap-ki's monthly literary review column in the July 1932 issue of *Shin Dong-A*. The author recounts an anecdote where a fellow writer, through an intermediary, requested not to be reviewed, fearing negative criticism. Yi Kap-ki discusses the unreasonableness of such a request, asserting the right to critique published works, regardless of the writer's or critic's perceived qualifications. He then humorously admits his review is late and potentially sparse because he has been preoccupied with playing baduk (Go), lamenting its addictive nature and resolving (perhaps unconvincingly) to quit.

For historians of colonial Korea, this piece offers a glimpse into the personal anxieties and interactions within the literary circle of the time. The writer's fear of criticism, Yi's defense of the critic's role, and the mention of specific leisure activities like baduk provide texture to the social and cultural life of intellectuals under Japanese rule. The casual, somewhat self-deprecating tone also reveals aspects of journalistic and literary column writing conventions during that period.
