**李光洙 (Yi Kwang-su)**

To think of Ch’unwŏn (春園) is to think of Kyŏngsŏng (京城). To think of Kyŏngsŏng is to think of Ch’unwŏn. Ch’unwŏn, who lives in Hyoja-dong (孝子洞), Kyŏngsŏng, has for over twenty years, through his writings, represented the modern culture of Chosŏn (朝鮮) and, through his life, represented the modern man of Chosŏn. It is no exaggeration to say that anyone who discusses the modern culture of Chosŏn or the modern man of Chosŏn cannot do so without mentioning Ch’unwŏn.

His hometown is Chŏngju (定州) in North P'yŏngan Province (平安北道). Born in the countryside, he went to Japan (日本) at a young age for studies, returned, and then for over twenty years, he has rarely left Kyŏngsŏng. Isn't his life itself one that breaks from the soil and leans towards urban, modern culture?

If you look at his works, starting from "The Heartless" (無情) to "The Soil" (土), "Love" (愛), and "Yi Sun-sin" (李舜臣), they all depict the process of Chosŏn's modernization, centered around Kyŏngsŏng. Even when the setting is the countryside, the consciousness expressed is urban. He has completely escaped the 'local color' of Chŏngju, his birthplace. He is thoroughly a man of Kyŏngsŏng, a modern man. It is said that he is currently writing a long historical novel, "The Tragic History of Prince Maui" (麻衣太子 悲史). I look forward to seeing what kind of work it will be.

**金東仁 (Kim Tong-in)**

Kim Tong-in (金東仁) is also from North P'yŏngan Province (平安北道). Just as Yi Kwang-su (李光洙) is from Chŏngju (定州), Kim Tong-in is from P’yŏngyang (平壤). P’yŏngyang is the largest city in the northwest region. It is a place known for its beautiful scenery since ancient times, often called a city of hedonism. Perhaps reflecting this local character, Kim Tong-in is a hedonist, a romanticist, and a decadent. He pursues beauty above all else and lives freely according to his desires. His literature is also like that. His representative work, "Potatoes" (감자), vividly portrays the decadent aspects of P’yŏngyang.

However, Kim Tong-in is not merely a local writer confined to P’yŏngyang. He, too, went to Japan (日本) for studies early on, absorbed modern culture, and has been active in Kyŏngsŏng (京城) for a long time. His consciousness is also urban and modern. His recent works, such as "Portrait of a Shaman" (巫女圖) or "Reflections on the Road" (路上感想), show a deeper exploration of human existence beyond simple decadence. He currently resides in Sŏdaemun (西大門), Kyŏngsŏng.

**廉想渉 (Yŏm Sang-sŏp)**

When thinking of Yŏm Sang-sŏp (廉想渉), one thinks of Seoul (서울), specifically Chŏngno (鍾路). He was born and raised in Chŏngno, the heart of Seoul. His literature also captures the atmosphere of Seoul, particularly the lives of the intellectuals and common people around Chŏngno. His representative work, "On the Eve of the Manse Movement" (萬歲前), depicts the anxieties and aspirations of Chosŏn (朝鮮) intellectuals just before the March First Movement (三一運動), centered around Seoul.

Yŏm Sang-sŏp, too, studied in Japan (日本) and experienced modern culture, but unlike Yi Kwang-su (李光洙) or Kim Tong-in (金東仁), he retains a strong 'Seoulite' character. His perspective is sharp and critical, often cynical. He observes the changing realities of Chosŏn from the viewpoint of a Seoul native intellectual. His recent works continue to delve into the complexities of Seoul life. He lives in Kahoe-dong (嘉會洞), Kyŏngsŏng (京城).

**蔡萬植 (Ch’ae Man-sik)**

Ch’ae Man-sik (蔡萬植) is from North Chŏlla Province (全羅北道). Thinking of him evokes the image of the fertile plains of the Honam (湖南) region. His literature often features the lives of farmers and the rural realities of Chŏlla Province (全羅道). His unique humor and satire, often self-deprecating, are said to reflect the characteristic temperament of the people from Chŏlla Province. His representative work, "Turbid River" (濁流), vividly portrays the struggles and decline of people in the Kunsan (群山) area during the colonial period.

Though he deals with rural themes, Ch’ae Man-sik is also an intellectual who studied in Seoul (서울) and Japan (日本). His critique of reality is sharp, exposing the contradictions of colonial Chosŏn (朝鮮) through satire. He is known for his skillful use of dialect and colloquial language, which adds a rich local flavor to his works. He currently lives in Kaesŏng (開城).

**李孝石 (Yi Hyo-sŏk)**

When thinking of Yi Hyo-sŏk (李孝石), one thinks of P’yŏngch’ang (平昌) in Kangwŏn Province (江原道). His hometown is known for its beautiful mountains and clear streams. Perhaps influenced by this natural environment, his literature is often lyrical and filled with descriptions of nature. His representative work, "When the Buckwheat Flowers Bloom" (메밀꽃 필 무렵), is a masterpiece that beautifully captures the atmosphere of a rural market and the wandering life, set against the backdrop of Kangwŏn Province's landscape.

However, Yi Hyo-sŏk is not just a writer of pastoral literature. He is also an intellectual who studied English literature and was influenced by Western modernism. His works explore themes of human desire, existential anxiety, and the beauty of life, often with a sophisticated and sometimes experimental style. He lived in P’yŏngyang (平壤) for a time and is now reportedly residing somewhere in the Hamgyŏng Province (咸鏡道) region. His literature combines the local color of Kangwŏn Province with a modern sensibility.

**Summary**

This article profiles five prominent Korean writers of the 1930s: Yi Kwang-su, Kim Tong-in, Yŏm Sang-sŏp, Ch’ae Man-sik, and Yi Hyo-sŏk. The author, Yu Chin-o, introduces each writer by associating them with a specific region (Kyŏngsŏng/Seoul, P'yŏngyang, Chŏngno/Seoul, Chŏlla Province, Kangwŏn Province) and discusses how their origins and experiences, particularly their exposure to modern culture often through studies in Japan and life in Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul), are reflected in their literary works and personal characters. The piece highlights the interplay between regional identity ('local color') and the modernizing influences shaping Korean literature and intellectual life during the colonial period. Historians might find the explicit linking of authors to specific regions and the framing of 'modernity' versus 'local color' particularly interesting, as it reflects contemporary perceptions of cultural identity and the centralizing influence of Kyŏngsŏng (colonial Seoul) and Japanese education within the Korean literary scene of the late 1930s. The selection of these specific authors and their associated traits offers insight into the perceived literary landscape of the time.
