**Body Text Translation:**
When Evening Comes
						Yohan

When evening comes
Birds go to roost
And shadows
Fade away
It is time to open
The eyes once closed
To see
The world of truth.

When evening comes
The river water warms
And dampness descends
Upon the grassy field.
Let us begin
To walk the path,
The wandering path
In search of dawn.

When evening comes
Insects chirp
And white clothes are spread
Upon the hill.
Let us gather under the moon
And wait.
Until Our Lord (하소님)
Comes.＜94＞

**Summary**

This poem by "Yohan" (John) describes the transition into evening, portraying it not as an end but as a beginning of perception ("open eyes... to see the world of truth") and action ("begin to walk the path... in search of dawn"). It uses imagery of nature settling down (birds roosting, shadows fading, insects chirping) contrasted with human wakefulness and purpose. The final stanza introduces a communal and possibly religious element, urging people to gather under the moon and wait for "Our Lord" (하소님), suggesting anticipation for a divine arrival or perhaps a metaphorical dawn. For historians, the poem offers a glimpse into the spiritual or perhaps subtly nationalistic sentiments of the time. The name "Yohan" and the term "하소님" suggest Christian influence, while the theme of enduring the night and seeking the dawn could be interpreted as an allegory for hope and perseverance under colonial rule, awaiting liberation.

저녁이 되면
						요한
져녁이 되면
새는 깃들고
그림자들은
스러지느니
감앗든 눈을
뜰 땝니다
참의 세계를
보기 위하야

저녁이 되면
강물은덥고
풀밧에 축이가
나려옵니다.
길 것기를
시작합시다.
새벽을 찾아
헤매는 길을

저녁이 되면
버레가 울고
언덕에 힌 옷이
깔리웁니다
달 아레 모여
기두릅시다
오아 하소님
오실 때까지.＜94＞
