祝辭
						在中國 金九

In today's Chosŏn, which has entered a dead end (袋路) politically and economically, I admire the efforts of your esteemed magazine, which has overcome all difficulties (萬難) to continue publication steadily for three years. At the same time, I hope that you will always strive to further enrich the content and especially contribute greatly to the advancement of our nation by concentrating the total capabilities (總力量) of our people. This replaces a congratulatory address. <92>

**Summary**

This is a brief congratulatory message from Kim Ku (writing from China) to the magazine *Samch'ŏlli* on its third anniversary. He acknowledges the difficult political and economic situation in colonial Korea ("Chosŏn") and praises the magazine for persevering. He encourages the publication to continue enriching its content and, crucially, to focus on consolidating the entire strength of the Korean people to contribute to national progress. For historians, this short piece is significant as it shows Kim Ku, a major figure in the Korean independence movement operating in exile, engaging with domestic publications and urging a focus on national unity and capability-building even amidst the constraints of colonial rule. It reflects his ongoing concern for the situation within Korea and his belief in the importance of cultural and intellectual fronts in the struggle for liberation.
