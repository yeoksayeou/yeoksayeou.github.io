奉禱聖壽無彊 (Prayer for Eternal Life and Health)

As we mark the New Year's Day of Shōwa 14, with awe and trepidation,
We humbly pray that His Majesty the Emperor, Her Majesty the Empress, and Her Majesty the Empress Dowager may enjoy eternal life and health, and that His Highness the Crown Prince, Her Highness Princess Yoshi-no-miya, Her Highness Princess Teru-no-miya, Her Highness Princess Taka-no-miya, and Her Highness Princess Yori-no-miya, the three Imperial Princesses, may be in good health.

Since the outbreak of the China Incident (支那事變), His Majesty the Emperor established the Imperial Headquarters (大本營)<30> and has attended its meetings, listening to reports on the military situation. Furthermore, we are simply moved with awe by His Majesty's gracious consideration in dispatching Aide-de-camps (侍從武官) to the Imperial Army and Navy soldiers fighting bravely in North China (北支), Central China (中支), and South China (南支). Moreover, we are further filled with awe that both Their Majesties have broadly granted memorial funds (祭粢料) even to the soldiers wounded or fallen ill in battle for the sake of the Emperor and the country, mourning their deaths.

Shōwa 14, January 1st, New Year's Day<30>
<30-31>

**Summary**

This short piece is a formal prayer published on New Year's Day, 1939, in the Korean magazine *Samch'ŏlli*. It expresses profound reverence and wishes for the long life and health of the Japanese Emperor Hirohito, the Empress, the Empress Dowager, the Crown Prince, and several imperial princesses. It also praises the Emperor's leadership during the Second Sino-Japanese War (referred to as the "China Incident"), mentioning his establishment of the Imperial Headquarters, attention to military reports, dispatching of aides to troops in China, and granting funds for soldiers killed or wounded in service. For historians, this article is a stark example of the coerced expressions of loyalty and emperor worship demanded from Koreans during the late colonial period. Its publication in a popular Korean magazine highlights the pervasive nature of Japanese imperial propaganda and the pressure on colonial subjects to publicly affirm their allegiance to the Japanese throne and war effort.
