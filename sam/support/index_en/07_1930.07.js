Despite hardships (storms, lightning), the river flows persistently, representing resilience. The poet calls for purification, urging comrades to cast out the corrupt (\"living corpses,\" \"injustice\") and cleanse the nation (\"wash the bloodstained sword\"), ultimately aiming for a future of freedom and joy associated with the river. The repeated refrain emphasizes the river's vital importance as the nation's lifeblood (\"blood and milk\") and serves as a rallying cry for its protection. For historians, the poem is a significant example of nationalist sentiment during the Japanese colonial period. It reflects a yearning for freedom, a call for collective action and purification, and the symbolic appropriation of a major geographical feature (the Han River) as the core of national identity and persistence against oppression, likely coded references to the colonial situation.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n한강\t한강\tHan River\n파인\t파인\tP'ain\n\n**Glossary**\n\n푸르든\t푸르던\tBlue; (older form of 푸르던)\n째어노아도\t째어놓아도\tEven if it splits/cleaves; (older spelling/form of 째어놓아도)\n굿굿히\t꿋꿋이\tSteadfastly, firmly; (older spelling of 꿋꿋이)\n흘너나간다\t흘러나간다\tFlows on; (older spelling of 흘러나간다)\n갓치\t같이\tLike, as; (older spelling of 같이)\n이러나\t일어나\tArise, get up; (older spelling of 일어나)\n직히자\t지키자\tLet's guard, let's protect; (older spelling of 지키자)\n젓\t젖\tMilk (specifically mother's milk), lifeblood; (older spelling of 젖)\n울줄모르는\t울 줄 모르는\tKnows not how to weep\n산송장\t산송장\tLiving corpse\n묵거서\t묶어서\tBinding, tying up; (older spelling of 묶어서)\n너코\t넣고\tPutting in, throwing in; (older spelling of 넣고)\n싯고서\t씻고서\tWashing; (older spelling of 씻고서)\n깁붐\t기쁨\tJoy, gladness; (older spelling of 기쁨)\n함깨\t함께\tTogether; (older spelling of 함께)\n흘너라\t흘러라\tFlow!; (older spelling of 흘러라)\n이자손\t이 자손\tThese descendants\n양하여주듯\t양하여 주듯\tAs (you) have nourished/raised; (older form, 양하다 = 기르다, 양육하다)\n압흐로\t앞으로\tHenceforth, in the future; (older spelling of 앞으로)\n살자야\t살자꾸나/살자\tLet's live!; (dialectal/older emphatic form of 살자)\n잇다\t있다\tIs, exists, resides; (older spelling of 있다)\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n잡지명\t삼천리 제7호\n발행일\t1930년 07월 01일\n기사제목\t한강직히자.\n필자\t파인\n기사형태\t시\n\n한강직히자.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t파인\n1\n푸르든 하늘에 소낙비오고\n번개불 바위를 째어노아도\n한강물 굿굿히 흘너나간다\n이땅의 쾌남아 정신과갓치\n동무야 이러나 한강직히자\n저강은 우리의 피와젓일세\n\n2\n불의와 불정에 울줄모르는\n산송장 묵거서 저강에너코\n더러운 피무든 칼끗싯고서\n깁붐의 바다로 함깨나가자\n동무야 이러나 한강직히자\n저강은 우리의 피와젓일세\n\n3\n흘너라 흘너라 자유의 강아\n수천년 이자손 양하여주듯\n압흐로 억만년 함께살자야\n우리의 정신이 너에게잇다.\n동무야 이러나 한강직히자\n저강은 우리의 피와젓일세","magazine":"삼천리 제7호","date":"1930년 07월 01일","title":"Let's Protect the Han River."},{"path":"07_1930.07/020.txt","issue":"07_1930.07","content":"**Body Text Translation:**\nTrends of the World\n\n1. India's Anti-British Movement\nIndia's anti-British non-compliance movement, following the arrest and imprisonment of its supreme leader, Mr. Kkandi (깐듸 - Gandhi), in early May, suddenly erupted into turmoil, like a prairie fire met by a fierce wind. Thus, following Mr. Kkandi came Mr. Ch'yabuji (챠부지), and following Mr. Ch'yabuji came Ms. Naijŭ (나이즈 - Naidu), and following her, Mr. P'at'el (파텔 - Patel) rose up... India's movement unfolds in this way, persistently and steadily without yielding, as when one leader is caught, another steps forward, and if they are caught, yet another rises. The fact that around 6 p.m. on the 23rd, 28 influential commercial organizations in Maengmae (孟買 - Bombay) city took the lead in holding a large-scale demonstration mobilizing 200,000 people speaks to how influential the movement has become, even reaching the merchant and industrial classes. Furthermore, the announcement on the 27th that giants of India's financial world gathered to newly organize an autonomous transaction bank, aiming to deal a blow to British banks and recover the banking business into Indian hands, while also planning to shift the insurance business to Indian society, allows one to gauge how actively the merchant class itself supports the anti-British movement. On another front, the plan to raid the salt warehouse in Tarasana (다라사나) village continued steadily, leading to the arrest of its leader, Mr. P'at'el, again on the 25th. At the Ttaramura (따라무라) salt works, another clash occurred between police forces and volunteer corps, reportedly resulting in about 30 injuries. Not only that, but the anti-British mass demonstration that occurred in Nankong (闌貢 - Rangoon) city on the 26th escalated into a major clash, almost like a war, with the British police force, leaving 52 dead and over 740 seriously or lightly injured. This unprecedented tragedy shows that India's movement is advancing endlessly through both strong and gentle means. <2>\n\n2. Soviet Russia's Two-Sex Front\n\"Break free from all bonds\" is the fundamental ideology of Soviet Nosŏa (露西亞 - Russia), so it is natural that women should be given the same freedom as men. Regarding professions, there is complete equality and equal rights; there are female army officers, female diplomats, and female drivers of trams, automobiles, and trains. The only difference between men and women is the six-week rest period given before and immediately after childbirth due to physiological distinctions.\n\nNext, concerning male-female relations, getting married or divorced is extremely convenient, with divorce established merely by notification from either the man or the woman. Therefore, the crime of adultery fundamentally does not exist, and sexual relations between individuals outside of marriage with third parties are frequent. Also, as sexual relations without marriage are much freer, the number of single people is increasing significantly. What then happens to children born in such an era of human relations? This is also disposed of entirely according to the free will of the parents. For this reason, methods of contraception are widely disseminated, and if a woman becomes pregnant, abortion is also legally stipulated as extremely freely available. While there are many countries that tacitly permit abortion, Nosŏa is likely the only country that legally sanctions abortion as acceptable. Consequently, in large cities like Mosakwa (莫斯科 - Moscow), publicly established abortion clinics (公設한 墮胎所) stand openly with large signs on every street. In Nosŏa now, the \"Red Love\" (붉은 연애) that Kkoront'ai (꼬론타이 - Kollontai) spoke of is fiercely spreading nationwide. <3>\n<2-3>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis article discusses two major global trends in mid-1930: the intensifying Indian independence movement against British rule and the radical social changes regarding gender relations and sexuality in Soviet Russia. It highlights the resilience of the Indian movement, noting the succession of leaders despite arrests, the growing involvement of the merchant class, economic boycotts, and violent clashes. It then describes Soviet policies promoting gender equality in work, simplified marriage and divorce, the absence of adultery as a crime, acceptance of non-marital relationships, and state-sanctioned contraception and abortion clinics as part of a new sexual morality termed \"Red Love.\" For historians, this article is interesting as it shows a Korean perspective from the colonial era keenly observing global anti-colonial struggles (India) and radical alternative social systems (Soviet Russia). It reflects an awareness of and potential interest in models challenging established imperial and social orders.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n印度\t인도\tIndia\n깐듸\t깐디\tKkandi\n챠부지\t챠부지\tCh'yabuji\n나이즈\t나이즈\tNaijŭ\n파텔\t파텔\tP'at'el\n孟買\t맹매\tMaengmae\n다라사나\t다라사나\tTarasana\n따라무라\t따라무라\tTtaramura\n闌貢\t난공\tNankong\n露西亞\t노서아\tNosŏa\n莫斯科\t모사과\tMosakwa\n꼬론타이\t꼬론타이\tKkoront'ai\n\n**Glossary**\n\n曩者\t낭자\tPreviously, some time ago (older form, Hanja-based)\n잇서\t있어\tBeing at/in (older spelling of 있어)\n함끠\t함께\tTogether with (older spelling of 함께)\n가티\t같이\tLike, as (older spelling of 같이)\n마럿다\t말았다\tEnded up doing (older spelling of 말았다)\n니어\t이어\tFollowing, succeeding (older spelling of 이어)\n끈긔잇고\t끈기 있고\tPersistently, tenaciously (older spelling)\n업시\t없이\tWithout (older spelling of 없이)\n되여\t되어\tBecoming (older spelling of 되어)\n力化되엇나\t역화되었나\tHow much influence it gained (older spelling/usage; 力化 means 'to become powerful/influential')\n모히어\t모이어\tGathering (older spelling of 모이어)\n잇는\t있는\tThat exists/is (older spelling)\n의연히\t의연히\tStill, resolutely (Hanja-based)\n안이라\t아니라\tNot only (older spelling)\n이러난\t일어난\tThat happened/arose (older spelling)\n사히에\t사이에\tBetween (older spelling)\n이르키여\t일으키어\tCausing, starting (older spelling)\n내이여\t내이어\tProducing, resulting in (older spelling)\n끗칠 바 업시\t끝일 바 없이\tWithout end, endlessly (older spelling)\n邁進됨을\t매진됨을\tThat it is striving forward (older spelling/usage; 邁進 means 'to strive forward')\n버서나라\t벗어나라\tBreak free from (older spelling)\n가튼\t같은\tSame, like (older spelling)\n仝等仝權\t동등동권\tEqual status and equal rights (Hanja compound; 仝 is an old form of 同)\n녀자\t여자\tWoman (older spelling)\n잇고\t있고\tAnd there is/are (older spelling)\n나키\t낳기\tGiving birth (older spelling)\n나흔\t낳은\tHaving given birth (older spelling)\n卽后\t즉후\tImmediately after (Hanja compound)\n아조\t아주\tVery, completely (older spelling)\n편하여서\t편하여서\tBeing convenient/easy (older form)\n屆出\t계출\tNotification, report (Hanja-based term, often used in legal/administrative contexts)\n잇스면\t있으면\tIf there is (older spelling)\n원악\t원악\tOriginally, fundamentally (older spelling of 워낙/원체)\n업스며\t없으며\tAnd there isn't (older spelling)\n피차에\t피차에\tMutually, between them (Hanja-based)\n훨신\t훨씬\tMuch more (older spelling)\n엇저는가\t어쩌는가\tWhat happens to them (older spelling/dialectal form of 어찌하는가)\n만치만은\t많지만은\tAlthough there are many (older form/spelling)\n조타고\t좋다고\tSaying it's good/okay (older spelling/colloquial form)\n부치고\t붙이고\tAttaching, putting up (older spelling)\n잇다\t있다\tThere is/are (older spelling)\n펴지고\t펴지고\tSpreading\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n잡지명\t삼천리 제7호\n발행일\t1930년 07월 01일\n기사제목\t世界의 動向\n기사형태\t논설\n\n世界의 動向\n1. 印度의 反英運動\n인도인의 反英不服從運動은 曩者 5월 상순에 잇서 그의 최고지도자인 『깐듸』씨의 체포수감됨과 함끠 마치 질풍을 맛난 燎原의 火勢와가티 居然動亂化하고 마럿다. 그래서 『깐듸』씨의 뒤를 니어 『챠부지』, 『챠부지』씨의 뒤를 니어 『나이즈』여사의 뒤를 니여 『파텔』씨 분기...인도의 운동은 이가티 지도자가 잡히면 대신나서고 또 잡히면 또다시 나서 끈긔잇고 꾸준하게 屈함이 업시 전개된다. 23일 오후 6시경부터 孟買市의 유력한 28개 상업단체가 주동이 되여 20만 대중의 動員下에 대시위운동을 거행하얏다 함은 그네의 운동이 상공계급에까지 얼마나 力化되엇나 함을 말함이오. 27일에 이르러 인도재계의 巨星들이 모히어 새로히 자치적 取引은행을 조직한 후 영국인 은행에 타격을 주어 은행사업을 印度人의 수중에 회수하는 동시 보험사업까지도 인도인 사회로 전환시키자는 계획을 발표하얏다 함은 商民계급 자체가 反英운동을 그 얼마나 적극적으로 지지하는가 짐작할 수 잇는 일이다. 이러한 일면 『다라사나』村의 製盬倉庫襲擊계획은 의연히 진행되여 25일에 이르러서는 그 지도자 『파텔』씨까지 또다시 체포당하게 되엿고 『따라무라』製盬場에 잇서서는 又復警官隊와 義勇隊와의 충돌이 잇서 30여명의 부상자를 내엿다고 한다. 뿐만 안이라 26일 闌貢市에서 이러난 反英대시위운동은 영국경관대와의 사히에 거의 전쟁이나 다름업는 대충돌을 이르키여 死者 52명에 중경상자 740여명을 내이여 稀有의 慘劇을 보게 되엿다 함은 强柔兩方面으로 인도의 운동이 끗칠 바 업시 邁進됨을 말하는 것이다.＜2＞\n\n2. 赤露의 兩性戰線\n「모든 覊絆에서 버서나라-」라 하는 것이 소비엣露西亞의 근본사상임으로 여성에도 남성과 가튼 자유를 주어야 할 것은 물론이다. 직업에 대하여도 전혀 仝等仝權으로 녀자의 육군사관도 잇고 여자의 공사도 잇고 녀자의 전차, 자동차, 기차의 운전수도 잇다. 다만 생리적 구별 때문에 아해를 나키 전과 나흔 卽后에 6주간의 휴양을 주는 것이 남녀의 차이라 할 것 뿐이다.\n\n그 다음 남녀관계를 말할지라도 결혼하자는 것이나 이혼하자는 것이 아조 편하여서 남녀 어느 한쪽의 屆出만 잇스면 이혼은 성립되게 되엇다. 그럼으로 간통이란 죄가 원악 업스며 또 부부이외에 피차에 제3자와의 성적교섭이 빈번하게 잇다. 또한 결혼이 업는 성적교섭도 훨신 자유인 결과 독신자가 월신 늘어간다. 이와가튼 人倫時代에 나는 아해들은 그러면 엇저는가 하면 이것도 전혀 그 부모의 자유의사에 의하여 처분이 된다. 그런 때문에 피임의 방법도 십분 보급되어 잇는데 만일 여성이 懷妊한 경우에는 墮胎도 극히 자유롭게 되기로 법률에 규정되어 잇다. 타태를 묵인하는 나라야 만치만은 타태하여도 조타고 법률로 공인한 나라는 아마 露西亞 뿐이리라. 그러기에 莫斯科 등 큰 도회의 거리거리에는 公設한 墮胎所가 큰 간판을 부치고 당당히 잇다. 露西亞는 지금 꼬론타이가 말하든 「붉은 연애」가 전국적으로 맹열히 펴지고 잇다.＜3＞\n＜2-3＞","magazine":"삼천리 (三千里)","date":"1930년 07월 01일","title":"Trends of the World"},{"path":"07_1930.07/030.txt","issue":"07_1930.07","content":"Overseas Figures' Time in Korea\n\nYi Tong-hwi's Youth\nKwŏn Tong-jin\n\n1\nWhen it comes to recording Yi Tong-hwi's youth, there are likely many who know more than I do. I was not a childhood friend who studied together with him, nor were we comrades-in-arms who wielded swords together in the military after growing up. What I know is that he was a man of spirit and resourcefulness, and we sat together many times to discuss public and private matters. He possessed extraordinary energy and a handsome, heroic appearance; I received a very favorable impression of him as a manly and refreshing, straightforward man. Therefore, even if I say I know his character, it may not be thorough, and if I try to gauge his wisdom and magnanimity, it might be superficial. Nevertheless, briefly recalling his appearance from 20 years ago, I will try to jot down a few words about his youth.\nI hear he was from Tanch'ŏn in Hamgyŏng Province. It seems his family was not wealthy or powerful; as the son of an *ajŏn* (아전, low-level functionary) serving in the local government office from childhood, his father intended to make him an *ajŏn* in the future, teaching him all the etiquette and Chinese classics considered the \"path of a government servant\" (官奴의 道). Mastering these would lead to becoming an *ibang* (吏房). <4> Young people today might not understand the term \"Ibang,\" but at that time, the government was organized into Six Ministries (六曹). Among them was the Ministry of Personnel (吏曹衙門), headed by a Minister of Personnel (吏曹判書), whose duties corresponded roughly to the current Minister of Home Affairs. The local governments had the exact same structure as the central government, so in Tanch'ŏn, under the Prefect (府使), there was an official called *Ijo* (吏曹), similar to today's head of the internal affairs department, who oversaw matters like taxes paid to the state and granary management. Yi Tong-hwi's stern father reportedly educated him with the intention of making him this *Ibang*. For this reason, he must have inevitably spent his childhood, from the time he had a runny nose, going to the government office and running errands for officials.\n\n2\nHowever, perhaps it was Heaven's design not to entrust a butcher's knife to cutting chicken for long, nor to keep a divine dragon in a marshy swamp indefinitely. Reflected in the eyes of the young Yi Tong-hwi, the corruption and tyranny of the ruling cliques (治者閥) at the time had truly reached an extreme. The hot-blooded youth harbored a great resolve and one day cast aside the so-called path to success like a pair of straw sandals (草鞋), leaving his hometown for Seoul.\nAt that time, he likely had no money and no acquaintances. He was barely twenty (弱冠), and his learning was still shallow (尙淺), so he must have been incredibly weary. Yet, his firm conviction was unbreakable, and eventually, not long after arriving in the Capital (京師), he met many like-minded friends (excerpt omitted - original text) and also obtained a position as a palace gatekeeper (守門하는 職). Then one day (excerpt omitted - original text)\nHis final position was Kanghwa Commandant (江華參領). Kanghwa is about 100 *ri* from Seoul, a crucial fortress on the primary defense line protecting the capital. Holding the rank of Commandant (參領), equivalent to a Colonel in today's army, he would occasionally come up to Seoul. His handsome figure, mounted on a white horse, would flash through the main streets of the capital (長安大路), receiving the admiration (欽慕) of the city's men and women.\nI recall that during the Tonghak Uprising (東學의 變), when righteous armies rose up everywhere, he led several thousand Kanghwa soldiers and was busy in various places suppressing (討代) the Tonghak members. (remainder omitted - original text)\nLater, as the times deteriorated and sorrowful people increased everywhere, he resigned from his official post and threw himself into the Sŏbuk Hakhoe (Northwestern Academic Association, 西北學會). Together with several comrades, he devoted himself widely to education, striving to enlighten people's minds (人智を啓參), import scientific civilization, and begin efforts, even if starting from scratch (臨井한 노력), such that he rarely had comfortable sleep or meals (寢食이 땃뜻한 때가 업섯스나). But as things went awry, in the autumn of the Kyŏngsul year (1910), he dragged his weary <5> body across the sea and disappeared.\n\n3\nWhat I remember now is that at that time, there was much debate among us about whether to remain inside the country or go abroad, and departures became frequent among those of consequence. Even thinking about it now, that day remains unforgettable. It was one evening in the autumn of the Kyŏngsul year; the short autumn sun had already tilted westward, and the long evening shadows lay across the main street of the capital (長安大道). I was sitting with Ŭi-am (義庵 - Son Pyŏng-hŭi) and O Se-ch'ang (吳世昌) at Son Ŭi-am's house in An'guk-tong (安國洞)—the place that is now Tongdŏk Girls' School—when Yi Tong-hwi came to visit. He simply said,\n\"I am going.\"\nJust that one brief statement. At that, Ŭi-am sat silently for a moment, then replied with an equally brief word,\n\"Going is probably fine, too.\"\nA heavy, cloud-like gloom spread over the faces of everyone in the room.\nThat evening, we bid farewell, perhaps never knowing if we would meet again in this life. As we parted, he said, \"Whether we stay inside or go outside, we must work.\"\nThen he added, \"Let's see who shouts first?\" I remember we even exchanged such bleak jokes. After he left, news occasionally arrived via correspondence, but there was no particular word until the Kimi year (1919), when he heard the shout had come from within the country.\nHe reportedly exclaimed, \"Alas (앗불사)! The friends inside shouted first.\"\n(excerpt omitted - original text) Though there's much I wish to say but cannot, generally speaking (대관절), is he healthy? And where is he residing now?\n\nThe Activities of Tosan An Ch'ang-ho\nYi Kwang-su\n\n1\nTosan (島山) An Ch'ang-ho (安昌浩) was born 54 years ago, in the Ulmi year (1895), in Kangso (江西), P'yŏngan Namdo (平安南道).\nHis family circumstances (가세) were not particularly affluent, nor was he from a prominent lineage, but he was born the second son of a respectable (젊잔은) family. From childhood, he attended the local village school (서당), studying the Four Books and Five Classics (四書五經). I have no way of knowing where his teacher (훈장) and classmates from that time are now, so I cannot inquire about Tosan's talents (재조) during his school days. However, according to stories occasionally told by village elders (村老), from a young age, he was known (일홈이 잇섯다고) <6> for his handsome, distinct features (얼골 바탕), his intelligence, his skill in writing, and his eloquence as a child prodigy (재동). Then, at the age of 17, harboring a different ambition, he reportedly came out (나왓더라) to P'yŏngyang (平壤). When he came to P'yŏngyang, he was still a bachelor. As roughly described sometime in the novel \"The Pioneer\" (先導者), there was a young widow in Kangso at that time, considered a peerless beauty (傾城의 佳人). Deeply enamored (열慕) with Tosan, she followed him to the crest of the front hill, tearfully (눈물 흘니며) pleading (애원하기에) to be taken along (다려가 달나고). It is said that the young Tosan's heart was tormented for a while by the conflicting flames of this affection. However, having firmly decided to leave his hometown (鄕關), his manly resolve was too firm to accept the devoted love of that young woman (少婦). Then, the young woman took off the pair of silver rings (은가락찌) she wore (끼엇든) on the ring finger (무명지) of her left hand, gave them to Tosan, telling him to use them for his travel expenses (路資), and then hid behind a willow tree (버들나무). She stood there gazing into the distance until Tosan's figure (그림자) vanished completely over the front hill. She must have been clutching a poor willow branch, shedding tears (눈물을 흘려가며) as she sent off the man she longed for. Later, in Shanghai (上海), Tosan told me this story (이악이) with a somber expression (낫빗).\nThe reason he went to P'yŏngyang was that an association (結社) called the Independence Club (독립협회) existed there, attracting talented individuals from all directions (四處), and grand theories (經國의 리론) on statecraft were being discussed (버러진다기에). His surging ambition (勃勃雄心) became unbearable. There, he reportedly befriended (相交) Mr. Pil Tae-yŏng (畢大榮), also from P'yŏngan Province. Mr. Pil Tae-yŏng, four years Tosan's senior at twenty, had already been to Seoul, was greatly influenced (감화) by Sŏ Chae-p'il (서재필), and had heard many speeches, making him a youth at the forefront (첨단을 것든) of the new thought of the time. Hearing about various contemporary situations from him, Tosan's mind seems to have become firmly resolved. From then on, staying at the same inn (여관) as Mr. Pil, they reportedly spent nights intensely discussing (痛論하엿다) the state of affairs. Then, several ambitious individuals in P'yŏngyang established a branch (지회) of the Popular Assembly (萬民共同會). One day (하로는), they held a major speech rally regarding the current situation at Pubyŏngnu Pavilion (浮碧樓). Several thousand people gathered there, including the P'yŏngyang Governor (平壤監司) and other notable officials (엔만한 관리) and private citizens (民間의 志者).\nAt that time, Tosan stood up (이러나) and delivered a speech (一場의 연설). Deeply moved (感이 극하야), not only the people on the platform wept (울엇거니와), but the thousands in the audience below also could not refrain (마지 안엇다) from shedding tears. This was <7> the first speech Tosan ever gave in his life, and it was also the initial event that caused the name An Ch'ang-ho, An Ch'ang-ho, to resonate highly (놉흐게 울니기) throughout P'yŏngyang. Soon after, he leaped (뛰어 올나왓다) onto the central stage in Seoul. However, after associating (사괴어) with various organizations and politicians, he ultimately concluded that broadening his perspective (견식) was the urgent task. Thus, along with Yi Kang (李剛) and one other young man, a total of three set off (올낫더라) on the path of studying abroad, heading for the United States.\n\n2\nLeaving behind a Chosŏn filled with the Analects and Mencius (論語孟子) and vague cries of \"Enlightenment, Enlightenment\" (開化開化), the aspirations (포부은) of the three young men crossing the Pacific, some 30 years ago, were undeniably grand. The three eventually landed (내리엇다) in San Francisco, North America (北美桑港). They went out (나서서) for a city tour and came upon a certain (엇든) street. How could they have anticipated (엇지 뜻하얏스리요) it? Several fellow Koreans (白衣兄弟), wearing topknots (상투) and traditional robes (도포), were right there on the main road (大路), grabbing each other's topknots, kicking, and hitting (따리면서) each other in a major fight. Nearby, of course, a crowd of Westerners had gathered like clouds, watching and jeering (조소). Seeing these Koreans fighting desperately like dogs and monkeys (견원가치) in a foreign land tens of thousands of miles away, were the three young men's hearts glad (깁벗슬가), pained (압헛슬가), or choked with tears (우럿슬가)? After barely stopping (말니고) the fight and asking (무르니) the reason, they learned that they (그네들은) were ginseng peddlers (인삼파는 행상). They had agreed amongst themselves to divide the territory (구역), with one selling in the eastern part of the city and another in the western part. However, that day, for some reason, someone else had entered his territory and was selling, which led to them fighting like this (이가치) on the main street (대로변).\nTosan and the other two clenched their fists and ground their teeth. A calling (부르즘) arose spontaneously (스사로 이럿낫다) within them: Our task, more urgent than studying, is to quickly unite these compatriots who have come to North America and guide them onto the right path!\nAt that time, Yi Kang, a man of character (人格者), said to Tosan (더러), \"When we came to America, the three of us agreed to work and study together. But we two will work to provide the tuition (학비를 대어 줄 터이니), so you alone (자네만) should focus on studying while also dedicating yourself fully to the salvation of our compatriots. Among the three of us, you have the most qualifications (자격이 잇스니) to be a leader!\"\nThus, two men worked to earn one man's tuition, and that one man received the tuition and began, with painstaking effort (刻骨하여), the task of guiding the compatriots. The organization Tosan established (만든 기관) at that time was the Kongnip Hyŏphoe (Mutual Assistance Association, 共立協會). After gradually gathering (모다) all the people in North America and having them join (가입케), he instilled (부어주는) political knowledge while also teaching them (가르처 주어서) effective methods for selling ginseng, allowing each to become economically prosperous (부유하게 되엇다). He also published (발행하엿는데) a newspaper called the Kongnip Sinbo (共立申報). After educating (교양하고) them in this way for a year, he himself felt (놋기엇더라) that progress comparable to a generation's change had been made. To introduce an anecdote from that time: whereas before, if you wandered (도라다녀) through the entire city of San Francisco, the unclean and poor houses without curtains (\"카-덴\") in the windows were Korean homes, after just one year, there was hardly a Korean home without curtains (카-덴을 처 잇지 안는 집이 업스리만치), to the extent that they became affluent (裕餘하고) and courteous people, <8> receiving the admiration (경탄을 밧엇다) of Westerners. Furthermore, a certain American missionary woman (美人선교사) who had become disillusioned with educating Koreans and had left (가버린) for the Northwestern states (西北洲?) came back after a year and couldn't cease (마지 안어) being amazed, profusely thanking Tosan for his efforts. According to her (그 선교사의 말을 듯건되), when she was there (자기 잇슬 때에는), even if she went door-to-door (집집마다 도라다녀야) asking people to come (와달나고) because there was a good speech, only 5 or 6 people might show up (오나마나), and even then, they would just snore (코를 구르며 자기나하여), making it impossible (엇절 수 업든) to do anything. But in just one year, whenever there was any meeting, hundreds would rush over (달녀와서) and earnestly discuss current affairs (時事를 논의하는), which could not but be (아니 되잘수 없다) astonishing (驚異).\nAs an aside, that Mr. Yi Kang reportedly was very active afterwards – was it the year before last (재작년엔가)? – while actively working (활약 고잇가) centered around some association (會) in Macao (墺門), China (中國), he was unfortunately arrested (잡힌 몸이 되어) and is now serving a 7-year prison sentence (징역형) in P'yŏngyang Prison (平壤형무소).\n\n3\nTosan returned to Korea in the Chŏngmi year (丁未年, 1907). That was when the Protectorate Treaty had been signed, the abdication had occurred, the army had been disbanded, and the situation (풍운) was rapidly becoming critical. I only saw him from afar when he stopped (들넛슬) in Tokyo (東京) on his way back. I was fifteen then and didn't even know (몰느든) An Ch'ang-ho was famous. I just heard that a Korean youth from America was giving a speech, so we students went (갓섯다) to the international students' association building. At that time, Ch'oe Nam-sŏn (崔南善) also spoke after Tosan, but due to his recurring malaria attacks, he collapsed (꺽구러졋섯다) on the stage. Tosan then held Yuktang (六堂 - Ch'oe Nam-sŏn's pen name) in his arms, took him straight to his inn (여관), and nursed him devotedly (극진히 간호하여 주엇다). This was the first time Tosan and Yuktang met (안 것이 이때가 처음이라). Yuktang was deeply moved (크게 감동바더) by this incident and confesses (고백하는 것을 들엇다) even to this day (今日에 이르기까지), \"I have never called anyone 'teacher' (선생) in my life, but I regard only Tosan as my teacher.\"\nAnyway (엇재뜬), Tosan returned to Korea, established Taesŏng School (大成學校) in P'yŏngyang, personally served (친히 교장이 되어) as principal, and worked hard (애쓰는). Meanwhile, together with Yu Tong-yŏl (류동열), Yi Kap (리갑), and several others, he showed much activity (만흔 활약을 보엿다) centered around the Sŏbuk Hakhoe. (Omitted - original text)\nThe time I properly (올케) met (맛난) the teacher was precisely then. One day (하로는), amidst the bustle (욱적욱적하든) surrounding the Sinminhoe (New People's Association, 新民會) affair, I met (만낫다) a handsome man (호남자) of about 30, with refined features (眉目이 수려하고) and clear speech (언해가 명쾌한), at an inn (엇든 여관) inside Seoul's South Gate (남대문안). That man (氏) was Tosan. He possessed looks (용모) that were truly rare (드무다 하리만치) in the world, both handsome (秀麗) and elegant (典雅).\n(excerpt omitted - original text)\nTosan went abroad in the Kyŏngsul year (1910). After he left, his respected father (嚴親) passed away (도라가시고), and years ago (年前), his elder brother (伯氏) also passed away (도라갓섯고). Last year, even his beloved mother (慈親), his only remaining parent in the world, passed away as well (마저 도라가섯다). How unfree has this pen been (얼마나 자유스럽지 못한 이 붓을 나는 잡엇든가) that I held to record the teacher's youth... I can only end (끗칠 뿐) here. <9>\n\nDr. Yi Sŭng-man's Time in Seoul\nCh'oe Rin\n\n1\nI don't know Dr. Yi Sŭng-man's (李承晩) affairs that well. This is because I didn't have that much interaction (交遊) with Dr. Yi during his youth. However, I did meet (맛나 뵈엇슴니다) him in Hawaii (布哇) this time when I went to Europe and America. When we clasped hands (손을 맛잡게) on the pier in Hawaii after more than 10 years, I was truly overcome with deep emotion (감개가 깁습데다). He was reportedly (합데다) renting a two-story Western-style house (2層洋館) in Hawaii at the time, living alone (독신생활) with an old woman cooking his meals. Perhaps because he is now nearing 60 (60에 갓가워), or perhaps due to many years of hardship (多年風霜으로 그려함인지), streaks of white were visible (반백이 보입데다만은) in his hair, but I was amazed (놀낫슴니다) by his consistent scholarly attitude (학구적 태도) and his dedication (성력을 다하고 잇는 데) to various tasks. According to what I heard later (그뒤에 드즉 즉), the Doctor left Hawaii and is now residing (게신다고) in the United States. At that time, I had the opportunity (기회을 어더서) to sit opposite (서로 마조 안즐) the Doctor several times and exchanged (주고 밧엇슴니다) talk about various matters. However, these are not suitable for recording here, so I will just pass over them (그냥 넘김니다만은). Anyway, the work the Doctor is currently involved in includes, of course, political matters centered on Koreans in America (在美朝鮮人), as well as Christian missionary work (기독교의 포교), education of young students (청년학도의 교육), and research in his own academic field (자신이 전공하는 학술연구). He is showing astonishing activity (놀라운 활약을 보이고 게십데다) day and night. While marveling at the Doctor's energy (정력) and passion (열성), I parted from him (갈나젓든 것이외다), sincerely wishing him good health (건강을 심중으로 축복하기를 마지 안으면서).\n\n2\nThinking now about him in his youth, I understand (압니다) the Doctor was originally born somewhere in Haeju (海州), Hwanghae Province (黃海道). Since those were old times (녯날이라), what schools could there possibly have been (무슨 학교가 잇섯겟슴니까) for education? So, it's said (함니다) that already as a boy, having a different ambition (뜻이 달너서), he rushed up (뛰어 올너와서) to Seoul and diligently prepared his language skills while attending an English school (영어학교). At that time, a segment of progressive individuals (新進하는 一部 人士) gathered around the Korean YMCA (조선기독교청년회).\nThey strove (애썻는데) to import Western civilization (泰西文明). The Doctor also entered (드러가서) the Christian church and was busy (분주하엿섯지요) with cultural movements, joining hands with certain figures of the time. As <10> I belonged (속하엿슴으로) to Ch'ŏndogyo then, our paths naturally differed (저절로 길이 달너서), so I had no way of knowing the specific details (구체적인 내용까지는) of his activities. However, the world acclaimed (세상에서는 李承晩, 李承晩 하고 추앙하는 이가 만고) Yi Sŭng-man, and as the schools and churches developed greatly through his hand, I always held the thought (생각만은 늘 가지엿든 것임니다) that he was an extraordinary worker (비범한 일꾼이다). I heard (드른즉) that at that time, besides church affairs, the Doctor worked hard (애썻고) for the maintenance of various schools like Minsin School (?) (微新學校) and Paichai School (培材學堂), and sometimes even stood at the blackboard (교단에까지 올나서서), enduring chalk dust (백묵가루를 자시면서), striving (노력하섯드람니다) to teach various sciences.\nWhile doing this, it goes without saying that he participated in various organizations (모모 단체 등) and engaged in social and political activities (사회적 정치적 확약을 하여 오든 것은 물론이외다). He suffered much persecution (迫害도 만히 밧엇고) from the Old Korean Empire government (舊韓國政府), and later, as the times changed, he reportedly faced (직면하엿드람니다) even more persecution (一層 만혼 박해). (excerpt omitted - original text)\nIsn't this sufficiently imaginable (넉넉히 짐작할 일이 아니겟슴니까?) from the fact that he was imprisoned (철창에 가치엇든) several times with Mr. Yi Sang-jae (李商在氏) and others on suspicion related to various incidents (모모 사변)?\n\n3\nAround the Kyŏngsul year (1910), when various people who had been here scattered (뿔뿔이 헤어지어 나아갈 때에), the Doctor alone, intending to somehow (그러터래로) work from within, held (띄고) an important position (중직) at the Central YMCA Hall (中央靑年會舘) on Chongno (鍾路) for a while and was busy day and night (日夜분주하엿섯슴니다). Then, after some time, he went abroad (박그로 나가 버리엇지요).\nI heard the news (소식을 들엇슴니다) that his family situation (가정적으로) was very difficult (不過하엿다) at that time. Although he had a wife and children (令閤이 잇스되), his family life was reportedly not harmonious (가정이 團樂하지 못하엿다) in many ways, so one can imagine (상상하기에 족함니다) how much intense anguish (자심한 고뇌을 격것슬지) the Doctor must have suffered alone amidst that. I also heard (들엇슴니다) that he was not well-off financially (재산이 有餘치 못하야), always living a life of consistent poverty (늘 貧窮一貫으로 생활을 하섯더라고).\nWhen I met him years ago (年前에 맛낫슬 때에도), the Doctor did not bring tobacco or alcohol near his lips (담배와 술을 입에 갓가히 하지 안코), living a very austere life (매우 근엄한 생활), almost practicing asceticism (거지반 금욕까지 하면서).\nAs he moved on the grand stage, his close friendships (親交가 대단히 깁헛스며) with prominent foreign politicians were very deep. Furthermore, his scholarship (그의 학술에 이르러는) is said (합데다) to be as deep (깁고) and broad (넓다고) as that of Dr. Kim Kyu-sik (金奎植박사) in Shanghai, enough to be considered his equal (쌍벽을 치리만치). (excerpt omitted - original text)\nThere are many things I wish to say but cannot (하고 십혼 말 여러 가지를 다 못함니다만은). However, looking back at his youth and thinking of the present, I just feel (늣길 뿐이외다) a renewed, earnest wish (새삼스럽게 간절함을) for his continued well-being (장래의 건재를 비는 마음) in the future. (End) <11>\n<4-11>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis 1930 article from *Samch'ŏlli* magazine features reminiscences by Kwŏn Tong-jin, Yi Kwang-su, and Ch'oe Rin about the younger days of prominent Korean figures then living abroad: Yi Tong-hwi, An Ch'ang-ho, and Yi Sŭng-man (Syngman Rhee), respectively. The authors recall anecdotes highlighting their subjects' early patriotism, character (Yi Tong-hwi's energy and resolve, An Ch'ang-ho's eloquence and organizational skills, Yi Sŭng-man's scholarly dedication and suffering), involvement in education (Sŏbuk Hakhoe, Taesŏng School, Paichai), organizing Koreans (Kongnip Hyŏphoe in the US), and early struggles against the declining Joseon dynasty and rising Japanese influence, ultimately leading to their exile. The accounts offer personal, albeit sometimes hazy, glimpses into the formative years and motivations of these key independence movement leaders before they left Korea. For historians, these contemporary recollections provide valuable insights into the personalities, early networks, and activities of major figures during the critical late Joseon and early colonial periods, revealing details about their origins, influences (like Sŏ Chae-p'il on An Ch'ang-ho), early organizational efforts both domestically and among emigrants, and the personal costs of their activism.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n李東輝\t이동휘\tYi Tong-hwi\n權東鎭\t권동진\tKwŏn Tong-jin\n咸鏡道\t함경도\tHamgyŏng Province\n端川\t단천\tTanch'ŏn\n六曹\t육조\tYukcho (Six Ministries of Joseon)\n吏曹衙門\t이조아문\tIjo Amun (Ministry of Personnel)\n吏曹判書\t이조판서\tIjo P'ansŏ (Minister of Personnel)\n京師\t경사\tKyŏngsa (Capital City, Seoul)\n江華\t강화\tKanghwa\n東學\t동학\tTonghak\n西北學會\t서북학회\tSŏbuk Hakhoe (Northwestern Academic Association)\n孫義庵\t손의암\tSon Ŭi-am (Son Pyŏng-hŭi)\n吳世昌\t오세창\tO Se-ch'ang\n安國洞\t안국동\tAn'guk-tong\n同德女學校\t동덕여학교\tTongdŏk Yŏhakkyo (Tongdŏk Girls' School)\n긔미년\t기미년\tKimi Year (1919)\n安昌浩\t안창호\tAn Ch'ang-ho\n島山\t도산\tTosan (An Ch'ang-ho's pen name)\n李光洙\t이광수\tYi Kwang-su\n乙未年\t을미년\tŬlmi Year (1895)\n平安南道\t평안남도\tP'yŏngan Namdo (South P'yŏngan Province)\n江西\t강서\tKangso\n平壤\t평양\tP'yŏngyang\n畢大榮\t필대영\tPil Tae-yŏng\n서재필\t서재필\tSŏ Chae-p'il\n獨立協會\t독립협회\tTongnip Hyŏphoe (Independence Club)\n萬民共同會\t만민공동회\tManmin Kongdonghoe (Popular Assembly)\n浮碧樓\t부벽루\tPubyŏngnu (Pavilion in P'yŏngyang)\n李剛\t이강\tYi Kang\n美國\t미국\tMiguk (USA)\n北美桑港\t북미상항\tPungmi Sanghang (San Francisco, North America)\n共立協會\t공립협회\tKongnip Hyŏphoe (Mutual Assistance Association)\n共立申報\t공립신보\tKongnip Sinbo (Newspaper)\n西北洲\t서북주\tSŏbuk Chu (Northwestern States?)\n中國\t중국\tChungguk (China)\n墺門\t오문\tOmun (Macao?)\n丁未年\t정미년\tChŏngmi Year (1907)\n東京\t동경\tTōkyō (Tokyo)\n崔南善\t최남선\tCh'oe Nam-sŏn\n六堂\t육당\tYuktang (Ch'oe Nam-sŏn's pen name)\n大成學校\t대성학교\tTaesŏng Hakkyo (Taesŏng School)\n류동열\t유동열\tYu Tong-yŏl\n리갑\t이갑\tYi Kap\n新民會\t신민회\tSinminhoe (New People's Association)\n上海\t상해\tSanghae (Shanghai)\n李承晩\t이승만\tYi Sŭng-man (Syngman Rhee)\n崔麟\t최린\tCh'oe Rin\n布哇\t포와\tP'owa (Hawaii)\n黃海道\t황해도\tHwanghae Province\n海州\t해주\tHaeju\n朝鮮基督敎靑年會\t조선기독교청년회\tChosŏn Kidokkyo Ch'ŏngnyŏnhoe (Korean YMCA)\n微新學校\t미신학교\tMisin Hakkyo (Misin School?

버루를 가치한 仝門修學의 벗도 아니고 또 長하야 가튼 軍門에 劒戟의 벗을 지은 사이도 아니엇섯다. 다만 안다면 그는 기개와 才略의 人이라 여러번 자리를 함께 하여 공사를 與議하엿고 그는 기력이 絶倫하고 풍채-俊豪한지라 사내답고 그 시원한 快男子임에 대단히 好印象을 밧엇슬 뿐이다. 그러기에 그의 성격을 안다 하되 철저치 못할 것이요. 그의 智量을 窺한다 하되 피상적일 것이나 간략하게라도 이제 20년전의 그의 風수를 眼前에 그려보면서 그의 청년시대를 두어마듸 적어보려 한다.\n내가 듯기에는 그는 咸鏡道 端川人이라 한다. 가정으 부유한 집이나 혹은 권문세가가 아니엇든 모양으로 어릴 때부터 衙門에 出仕하는 아전의 아들로 그 아버지는 그를 장차 아전을 만들고저 「官奴의 道」라 할 온갖 예의와 漢學 등을 배워주엇는데 이것이 熟習이 되면 吏房이＜4＞ 되는 것이다. 「吏房」이라 하면 지금 시대 청년들은 그 말을 잘 알어 듯지 못할 듯 하나 그때 정부가 6曹로 조직되엇섯는데 그 중에 吏曹衙門이란 것이 잇고 그 吏曹에는 吏曹判書가 잇서서 맛치 지금의 내무대신격에 해당하는 일을 하는 관직이엇다. 그런데 지방에도 중앙정부와 꼭가튼 조직으로 되어서 端川에는 府使아래 吏曹라는 마치 지금의 내무부장격 관리가 잇서 국가에 상납하는 세금이라든지 穀倉의 관리 등을 도마터 하엿섯다. 李東輝군의 嚴親이 그를 이 吏房을 식힐 작정으로 교육식혓다 하는데 그런 까닭으로 그는 코물 흘니는 어릴 때부터 필연 관아에 나가 官人의 심부름 등을 하며 지내엇스리라.\n\n2\n그러나 牛刀를 割鷄에 오래 맛기지 안으며 神龍을 草澤에 오래 養하게 하지 안음이 天의 配定이라 할가. 소년 李東輝군의 눈동자에 비최는 당시 治者閥들의 부패와 횡포는 실로 극도에 달하야 다혈질의 그는 크나큰 결심을 품고 一朝에 소위 영달의 길을 草鞋가치 버리고서 서울을 향하야 故里를 떠낫섯다.\n그는 그때 돈도 업고 知己도 업섯슬 것이라 연령도 弱冠이요. 修學도 尙淺하여 고단하기 짝이 업섯슬 것이로되 굿굿한 신념만은 꺽글 길이 업서 마츰내 未久에 京師에 도달한는 뜻잇는 벗을 만히 맛나고(중략-원문) 또 宮廷의 守門하는 職을 맛게 되엇다. 그러다가 하로는(중략-원문)\n그의 최후의 職은 江華參領이엇다. 江華라 하면 서울을 距*기 百里의 程이요. 수도를 직히는 第1線的의 중요한 요새지라 現時의 陸軍大佐에 해당하는 參領의 직에 잇서 각금 서울로 올라와서는 백마를 탄 그 풍채조흔 一身을 長安大路에 번득이어 滿都士女의 欽慕를 밧엇섯다.\n일즉 東學의 變으로 사방에 의병이 起함애 江華手兵 數千을 率하고 그도 東學黨員의 討代에 四處에 분주한 기억이 잇섯다.(하략-원문)\n그러다가 時世가 기우러저 사처에 우는 사람이 만케 되매 그도 관직을 사하고 西北學會에 몸을 던지어 여러 동지들과 가치 교육에 널니 힘쓰고 人智를 啓參하며 과학문명을 수입하야 臨井한 노력이라도 開始하기로 하야 寢食이 땃뜻한 때가 업섯스나 事-임이 去함애 바로 경술년 가을에 바다밧그로 고단한＜5＞ 몸을 니끌어 감추고 말엇섯다.\n\n3\n지금 생각나는 것은 그때에 우리들 사이에는 이대로 안에 머물너 잇느냐 또는 밧그로 나가버리느냐 하는 문제가 만허서 웬만한 사람들은 떠나는 일이 빈번하엿다. 지금 생각하기에도 그때 일만은 이처지지 안으니 경술년 가을 짜른 해는 이미 西쪽으로 기울고 저녁의 긴 斜陽이 長安大道에 자르눕고 잇는 어느날 저녁이엇다. 지금은 同德女學校가 된 安國洞의 孫義庵宅에서 義庵과 吳世昌군과 나의 세사람이 안저 잇는데 李東輝군이 차저왓다. 와서 하는 말이\n「나는 가겟소.」\n하는 간단한 일언을 한 뿐이엇다. 그때 義庵은 한참 잠잠하고 안젓다가\n「가는 것도 조켓치요.」\n하는 亦足 간단한 一言으로 대할 뿐이고 방 안의 여러 사람 얼골에는무거운 구름빗이 떠도랏다.\n그날 저녁에 우리들은 생전에 다시 맛날는지 모르는 작별을 짓고 말엇다. 갈나질 때에 그는 「안에 잇스나 박갓헤 가 잇스나 일을 하여야지.」\n그러고는\n「누가 몬저 소리를 치는가 볼가?」하고 적막한 농담까지 주고 밧은 기억이 잇다. 그는 一去后 風便에는 간혹 소식이 들니나 별로 기별이 업다가 긔미년에 안에서 소리첫다는 말을 듯고\n「앗불사, 안에 잇는 벗들이 몬저 소리첫군.」\n하더라고 전하더라.(중략-원문) 하고 십흔 말은 못하나 대관절 그는 건강한가 또 어데에 지금은 기거하고 잇는가?\n\n島山安昌浩氏의 活動\n李光洙\n\n島山安昌浩선생은 지금으로부터 54년전인 乙未年에 平安南道 江西에서 나섯다.\n가세가 그러케 부유하거나 그리 큰 명문의 出은 아니엇지만은 젊잔은 집안의 둘재 아들로 태어나서 어릴 때부터 그 고을 서당으로 다니면서 四書五經을 배웟다. 그때의 훈장과 서당동무들이 지금은 어듸에 잇는지 알 길이 업서서 在學時代의 島山의 재조를 무를 바가 업스나 村老들이 간혹 전하는 말을 듯건대 어릴 때부터 잘생긴 뚜렷한 그 얼골 바탕과 총명하고 글 잘짓고 말 잘하는 재동으로 일홈이 잇섯다고＜6＞ 한다. 그러다가 17살되든 해에 딴 뜻을 품과 平壤으로 나왓더라 한다. 平壤으로 나올 때는 총각의 몸이라 언젠가 「先導者」라는 소설 속에서도 대강 기술하엿지만 그때 江西에 傾城의 佳人으로 치는 젊은 과부가 잇섯는데 그가 도산선생을 열慕하는 나머지에 압고개 마루턱까지 따라나와서 가치 다려가 달나고 눈물 흘니며 애원하기에 청춘인 島山의 가슴 속에도 相克하는 이 애욕의 불길 때문에 한참은 괴로웟섯다 한다. 그러나 일단 마음을 결정하여 鄕關을 나서는 몸이라 애틋한 그 少婦의 사랑을 밧어드리기에는 너무 男兒의 뜻이 굿엇다. 그제는 그 少婦는 왼손 무명지에 끼엇든 은가락찌 한쌍을 주섬주섬 빼어서 島山을 주며 路資에 보태 쓰라고 하고는 저는 버들나무 뒤에 숨어 島山의 그림자가 압산 고개너머 가물가물 아조 사러질 때까지 먼-히 서서 바라보고 잇드라 한다. 필연 애꾸진 버들가지를 휘여잡고 눈물을 흘려가며 그리운 사람을 보내고 잇섯스리라. 뒷날 上海에서 島山은 날더러 그때 이악이를 하며 적적한 낫빗을 짓더라.\n그가 平壤에 간 뜻은 독립헙회라 하는 結社가 평양에 잇서서 四處로 인재가 모히고 무슨 큰 經國의 리론이 버러진다기에 勃勃雄心을 참을 길이 업서 간 것이다. 그곳에서 역시 平安道 사람인 「畢大榮」이란 분을 相交하게 되엇다 한다. 畢大榮氏는 그 당시 島山보다 4년 長인 스무살이엇스나 일즉 서울에 올너가서 서재필씨의 감화를 만히 밧고 또 연설도 만히 드러 그 당시 신사상의 첨단을 것든 청년이엇다. 그로부터 여러 가지 시대형편을 듯는 島山의 마음은 굿게 결심되는 바 잇섯든 모양으로 그제는 畢씨와 가튼 여관에 묵으면서 밤을 새어가며 시세를 痛論하엿다 한다. 그러자 平壤의 여러 뜻잇는 사람들은 萬民共同會의 지회를 설치하고 하로는 浮碧樓에서 시세에 대한 큰 연설회를 열엇는데 그 자리에 平壤監司이하 엔만한 관리와 민간의 志者들이 수천명이 모엿더라 한다.\n그때 島山은 이러나 一場의 연설을 하엿는데 感이 극하야 단상의 人도 울엇거니와 壇下의 수천 군중도 눈물을 흘니기를 마지 안엇다 한다. 이것이 島山으로＜7＞ 일생에 처음하여 본 연설이자 또 평양천지에 安昌浩, 安昌浩하는 소리가 놉흐게 울니기 시작한 첫 발단이라고 한다. 그러다가 未幾에 그는 서울의 중앙무대로 뛰어 올나왓다. 그러나 온갓 단체와 政客들과 사괴어 보다가 결국 큰 견식을 기르는 것이 급무라 하여 李剛과 또 다른 청년 한 사람과 모다 셋이 미국을 향하야 유학의 길에 올낫더라 한다.\n\n2\n論語孟子와 막연한 開化開化의 소리로 찬 조선을 뒤에 두고 태평양을 거느는 세 청년의 포부은 때가 30여년전이니 만치 壯하다 아니할 수 업섯다. 셋은 급기야 北美桑港에 내리엇다. 그래서 市街구경차로 나서서 엇든 길가에 가니 엇지 뜻하얏스리요. 상투 틀고 도포입은 白衣兄弟 여럿이 그 大路 우에서 서로 상투를 잡고 발길로 차며 손으로 따리면서 크게 싸우고 잇섯다. 그 부근에 양인들이 구름가치 모여 조소하면서 구경하고 잇슨 것은 물론이라 수만리 타국에 와서 견원가치 한사코 싸우는 이가튼 조선사람들을 바라볼 때에 세 청년의 가슴은 깁벗슬가 압헛슬가 또는 긔막혀 우럿슬가 겨우 싸홈을 말니고 그 이유를 무르니 그네들은 피차에 인삼파는 행상들인데 서로 구역을 정하여 너는 東部市街에 나가 팔고 아모개는 西部市街에 나가 팔기로 서로 언약이 되엇는데 그날은 엇던 까닭인지 딴사람이 제 구역에 드러와 팔고 잇슴으로 그래서 대로변에서 이가치 싸우게 되엇다고 한다.\n島山 등 세사람은 주먹을 쥐고 이를 갈엇다. 우리의 할 일이란 공부보다도 하로 급히 北美에 와잇는 이 동포들을 단결식히고 올흔 길로 인도하여 나가자! 하는 부르즘이 스사로 이럿낫다.\n그때에 李剛이란 사람은 人格者라 島山더러 「미국 올 때는 셋이 피차에 노동을 하여 공부하기로 하엿스나 우리 둘이 노동을 하여 학비를 대어 줄 터이니 자네만 공부하는 한편 동포의 구제에 전력하라. 우리 셋중에 그대가 가장 지도자 될만한 자격이 잇스니!』\n이리하야 두사람은 노동하여 한사람의 학비룰 만들고 한사람은 그 학비를 밧어서 刻骨하여 가며 동포의 지도에 착수하게 되엿스니 그때 島山선생이 만든 기관이 共立協會라 북미에 가잇는 사람을 점차 모다 가입케 한 뒤 정치상의 지식을 부어주는 한편 인삼을 잘 파는 방법도 가르처 주어서 각기 경제적으로 부유하게 되엇다. 한편 共立申報란 신문지도 발행하엿는데 이리하야 1년동안을 교양하고 나니 격세의 진보가 잇는 것을 스사로 놋기엇더라 한다. 그때의 일화 한가지를 소개하건대 桑港의 全市街를 도라다녀 보아도 창문에 「카-덴」을 아니 친 불결하고 가난한 집이 조선사람 집이더니 불과 1년이 지나자 조선사람이 살고 잇는 집집마다 「카-덴」을 처 잇지 안는 집이 업스리만치 그러케 생활이 裕餘하고 禮儀를 아는 사람들이＜8＞ 되엇다 하야 양인의 경탄을 밧엇다 하며 더욱 조선인의 교화에 진력하다가 실망하고 西北洲로 가버린 엇든 美人선교사가 1년만에 와보고 놀라기를 마지 안어 島山선생의 공을 百謝하더라 한 그 선교사의 말을 듯건되 자기 잇슬 때에는 조흔 연설이 잇스니 와달나고 집집마다 도라다녀야 5,6人이 오나마나 하고 또 와서는 코를 구르며 자기나하여 엇절 수 업든 조선사람이 불과 1년 에 모든 회합 잇다던 수백명이 달녀와서 열심히 時事를 논의하는 것이 한갓 驚異 아니 되잘수 없다 함이다.\n딴말이나 그때의 그 李剛이란 분은 그 뒤에 만히 활약하다가-재작년엔가 中國 墺門에서 엇든 會를 중심으로 크게 활약 고잇가 그만 잡힌 몸이 되어 지금은 7년의 징역형을 고 平壤형무소에 가치어 복역중이라 한다.\n\n3\n島山은 丁未年에 귀국하엿다. 그때는 보호조약이 체결되고 양위가 잇고 군대는 해산되고 풍운이 바야으로 급하든 때라 나는 그가 귀국하는 도중에 東京에 들넛슬 때 먼 방으로 보앗슬 뿐이다. 그때의 내 나히 열다섯이라 안창호가 유명한 사람인 줄도 몰느든 때엇는데 다만 미국서 온 조선청년이 연설한다고 하기에 우리들은 유학생회로 갓섯다. 그때 崔南善君도 島山의 뒤를 이어 연설하다가 각금 발작하는 학질 때문에 그만 단상에 꺽구러졋섯다. 그러자 島山은 六堂을 자긔 가슴에 안고 그 길로 여관에 와서 극진히 간호하여 주엇다. 島山과 六堂이 안 것이 이때가 처음이라 六堂은 이 일에 크게 감동바더 「자기는 지금까지 평상에 선생이라고 불느는 이가 업스나 오직 島山 한 분은 선생으로 안다」고 今日에 이르기까지 고백하는 것을 들엇다.\n엇재뜬 島山선생은 귀국하여 平壤에 大成學校를 만들고 친히 교장이 되어 애쓰는 한편 류동열\n리갑 기외 여러 분들과 가치 西北學會를 중심으로 만흔 활약을 보엿다.(略-원문)\n내가 선생을 정말 올케 맛난 것은 바로 이때이니 하로는 新民會 일로 욱적욱적하든 판에 서울 남대문안 엇든 여관에서 眉目이 수려하고 언해가 명쾌한 30左右의 호남자 한 분을 만낫다. 氏가 도산이엇다. 그는 실로 세상에 드무다 하리만치 秀麗하고도 典雅한 용모를 가지고 잇섯섯다.\n(중략-원문)\n島山선생은 경술년에 해외로 나갓는데 나간 뒤 嚴親이 도라가시고 年前에 伯씨까지 도라갓섯고 오직 세상에 한분이든 慈親까지 작년에 마저 도라가섯다. 청년시대의 선생을 기록하기에 얼마나 자유스럽지 못한 이 붓을 나는 잡엇든가...여기에는 이에 끗칠 뿐＜9＞\n\n李承晩博士의 在京時代\n崔麟\n\n1\n李承晩박사의 일은 내가 그러케 잘 아지를 못함니다. 李박사와 청년시대에 交遊한 적이 그러케 만치 못하엿스니까요. 다만 금번에 歐美를 갈 때에 布哇에서 맛나 뵈엇슴니다. 10여년 만에 布哇부두에서 손을 맛잡게 되니까 실로 감개가 깁습데다. 그 분은 그때 布哇에서 2層洋館 한채를 세를 마터가지고 노파를 두고 밥을 지어 자시면서 독신생활을 하고 잇는다 합데다. 이제는 60에 갓가워 그러함인지 또는 多年風霜으로 그려함인지 머리깔에는 반백이 보입데다만은 그 일관한 학구적 태도와 여러 가지 일에 성력을 다하고 잇는 데는 놀낫슴니다. 그뒤에 드즉 즉 박사는 布哇를 떠나 지금은 미국에 가 게신다고 합데다. 나는 그때 박사와 서로 마조 안즐 기회를 어더서 여러번 이일 저일 이약이를 주고 밧엇슴니다. 그러나 여기에는 기록할 것이 되지 못하여 그냥 넘김니다만은- 엇재뜬 현재 박사가 관계하고 잇는 일은 在美朝鮮人을 중심으로 한 정치상 방면 일은 물론 기독교의 포교와 청년학도의 교육과 또 자신이 전공하는 학술연구 등으로 日夜 놀라운 활약을 보이고 게십데다. 나는 박사의 정력과 열성에 감탄하는 동시에 그의 건강을 심중으로 축복하기를 마지 안으면서 갈나젓든 것이외다.\n\n2\n이제 청년시대의 그 분을 생각하여 보면 박사는 원래 黃海道 海州에선가 출생한 줄 압니다. 그때에도 녯날이라 교육을 밧자한들 무슨 학교가 잇섯겟슴니까. 그러서 소년 때에 벌서 뜻이 달너서 그는 서울에 뛰어 올너와서 영어학교를 다니면서 열심히 어학을 준비하엿다고 함니다. 그때에 新進하는 一部 人士들은 조선기독교청년회를 중심으로 모아들엇지요.\n그래서 泰西文明의 수입에 애썻는데 박사도

For historians, the poem is a poignant expression of the suffering and sense of helplessness felt under colonial rule.

During this time, the economic and political freedom of the Taiwanese people has been greatly [suppressed/illegible]. Even the patient and peaceful Taiwanese people could finally endure it no longer, and thus began their movement to acquire freedom 10 years ago. This took the form of a demand for the establishment of a Taiwanese Parliament (臺灣議會開設), submitted to the Imperial Diet (帝國議會) as a petition in the spring of 1920. Its main point was to demand the enactment of a Taiwan Governance Law (臺灣통치법) that would respect Taiwan's unique culture and distinct popular sentiment through special legislation, and also establish a parliament composed of representatives publicly elected by the residents of Taiwan, granting them the right to deliberate on the Taiwanese budget. The timing for this becoming an overt movement was extremely<4> late, and the content and methods of the movement were so exceedingly weak that one might doubt if it could even be called a freedom movement.\n\nHowever, even towards such a movement, the suppression by the Taiwanese authorities was truly harsh. Indeed, it could be said that the reason the movement for establishing a Taiwanese parliament has drawn even a little public attention, as it does today, is because of the violent oppression by the Taiwanese authorities.\n\nInitially, those who signed this petition were immediately dismissed from their positions if employed in government offices or companies (官衙會社), and government and public schools (官公立學校) would not even accept the children of petitioners. Furthermore, anyone connected to government-run enterprises had all their vested rights taken away. For those figures who still intended to continue the movement despite this, the police engaged in various forms of [interference/illegible], and finally, on December 16, Taishō 12 (1923), they carried out a large-scale island-wide roundup (一大檢擧) of the petitioners, targeting key figures in various regions, and imprisoned over 50 people.\n\nThis petition movement, which they thought could be eradicated by this final great iron hammer, has weakly but nonetheless continued, and the 11th petition was submitted even to the 58th special session of the Diet. However, the Taiwanese authorities have still not loosened their hand of suppression, and to this day, they continue to strictly forbid associations, assemblies, and speech related to this matter.\n\nThe movement to establish a Taiwanese Parliament, on one hand,<5> aims to secure the freedom of the Taiwanese people and establish the right to self-governance (自治權). However, the biggest reason given for opposing the Taiwanese parliament movement is that many people desperately cry out that it is a violation of the constitution (헌법위반). Yet, I believe the appropriateness of this movement is a matter to be judged from a political perspective, not something to be interpreted through legal theory. (Omitted section - original text)\n\nThe Taiwanese authorities, as described above, not only forcefully suppress the moderate freedom movement of the Taiwanese people, but all their policies are consistently implemented in a way that threatens the livelihood of the Taiwanese people, driving them to a state where, as the saying goes, \"a cornered rat will bite the cat\" (窮鼠가 고양이를 무는 격). That is, materially, they have adopted an imperialistic (帝國主義) policy of economic exploitation (經濟搾取), and spiritually, they have forcefully implemented a blatant assimilationist (仝化主義的) obscurantist policy (愚民政策). With these two great wheels, they are attempting to drive [them] thoroughly into a state of poverty.\n\nThe reason why the Taiwanese people are being dragged into economic poverty can be understood by reading the publication titled \"Taiwan Under Imperialism\" (帝國主義下의 臺灣).\n\nNow, I intend to record a glimpse of the reality of being led into spiritual poverty.\n\nThe common language of the Taiwanese people is not Japanese. Our common languages are the two major languages of Southern China (南中語, 即 南部中國), namely Hokkien (福建語) and Cantonese (廣東語), and our common written script was the Han characters (한문한자) used throughout the 400-plus provinces of China. It is indisputable that our spiritual wealth is stored in this common spoken and written language.\n\nQualitatively, due to the National Language Monolingualism Policy (國語單一主義 - referring to Japanese), the intellectual capacity of the Taiwanese people has greatly declined. Quantitatively, the policy favoring government schools above all (官學萬能) coupled with the suppression of private schools (私學抑制) has severely<6> hindered the spread of education among the Taiwanese populace.\n\nElementary education operates under an absolute government monopoly principle. For secondary education, while 2 or 3 private schools are allowed to exist, they are still not granted general, standard accreditation. Moreover, since the commonly used Han characters (한문) are not taught, even the Japanese language learned laboriously through gestures becomes gradually forgotten, as if one had never received education, the moment one steps outside the school.\n\nFinding this miserable situation painful to watch, we planned to promote the Roman script (羅馬字) to alleviate the general hardship, but the authorities bravely prohibited even this. (Remainder omitted - original text) <7>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis 1930 article by Taiwanese author Ch'ae P'ae-hwa (Cai Pei-huo) recounts the Taiwanese freedom movement under Japanese rule, focusing on the petition campaign for a Taiwanese Parliament initiated in 1920. Ch'ae details the harsh suppression faced by activists, including job loss, denial of education for children, confiscation of rights, police harassment, and mass arrests. He criticizes Japanese colonial policies as imperialistic economic exploitation and assimilationist \"obscurantist policy,\" arguing they aimed to impoverish Taiwanese people materially and spiritually. Specifically, he laments the decline in intellectual capacity due to the imposition of Japanese and the neglect of native languages (Hokkien, Cantonese) and Han characters, hindering education and cultural continuity, even noting the suppression of efforts to use Roman script for literacy.\n\nFrom the perspective of Korean colonial history, this article is highly interesting as it provides a contemporary, parallel account of Japanese colonial practices from a non-Korean colonized subject. Historians might find value in comparing the specific methods of suppression (targeting jobs, schools, language), the nature of the resistance movement (parliamentary petition), and the critiques of economic and cultural policies (exploitation, assimilation, language suppression) described in Taiwan with those experienced in Korea during the same period. The mention of suppressing Roman script use offers a specific point of comparison to language policies in Korea.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n臺灣\t대만\tTaiwan\n日本\t일본\tJapan\n臺灣人\t대만인\tTaiwanese person\n蔡培火\t채배화\tCh'ae Pae-hwa\n帝國議會\t제국의회\tImperial Diet\n官衙會社\t관아회사\tGovernment Offices and Companies\n官公立學校\t관공립학교\tGovernment and Public Schools\n臺灣당국\t대만당국\tTaiwanese Authorities\n大正\t대정\tTaishō (Japanese era name)\n南中語\t남중어\tSouthern Chinese languages\n福建語\t복건어\tHokkien language\n廣東語\t광동어\tCantonese language\n中國\t중국\tChina\n\n**Glossary**\n\n통치\t통치\trule, governance\n자유\t자유\tfreedom\n획득\t획득\tacquisition, attainment\n이르키엇다\t일으켰다\tstarted, initiated (older spelling of 일으켰다)\n開設\t개설\testablishment, opening\n요구\t요구\tdemand, request\n請願\t청원\tpetition\n제출되엇다\t제출되었다\twas submitted (older spelling of 제출되었다)\n고유\t고유\tunique, inherent\n특유\t특유\tdistinctive, peculiar\n존중\t존중\trespect\n특별입법\t특별입법\tspecial legislation\n예산\t예산\tbudget\n의결권\t의결권\tright to vote, voting rights\n부여\t부여\tgranting, bestowal\n公選\t공선\tpublic election\n조직\t조직\torganization, formation\n엇섯다\t있었다\twas, existed (older spelling of 있었다)\n표면운동\t표면운동\tovert movement, public movement\n其時機\t기 시기\tthat timing, that opportunity (uses Hanja 其 for 'that')\n느젓섯고\t늦었었고\twas late and...

The young man's name is Reynolds (레노룻). Inspired by Gandhi's faction tirelessly working day and night, sparing no effort (骨身을 앗기지 안코) for India's independence movement, this young man left his home country of Britain (英吉利) alone and traveled ten thousand leagues to where Gandhi was. It is said that he thus gained Gandhi's absolute trust<7> and fulfilled even the most crucial task of delivering documents.\n\nArrests\nDue to the freedom movement that arose in Taiwan (臺灣), over 50 youths from the mainland [referring to Taiwan itself as the 'mainland' in this context] were arrested and imprisoned all at once on December 16, Taishō 12 (1923). This was reportedly done to suppress the beginning (開始) of a petition movement for self-government (자치).\n\nEducation Policy\nTaiwan's education policy is a matter that draws considerable interest from our perspective (우리로안저).

From a Korean colonial history perspective, the article is interesting for drawing parallels between different anti-colonial struggles (India, Taiwan) and showing Korean interest in the specific mechanisms of Japanese colonial policy, like education, in other territories like Taiwan.

It is the establishment of Ewha Women's University (梨花女子大學). As everyone likely knows, Ewha Haktang (梨花學堂) was founded in 1910 by Miss Price and has made many contributions to women's education for about 20 years since then. Indeed, Paejae Haktang (배재학당) and Ewha Haktang were shining twin stars in the Korean educational world during the enlightenment period, producing many talented individuals in all fields such as politics, economics, and literature. Ewha Haktang, with such a deep history, has now decided to establish the first and only women's university in Korea and is currently busy with preparations. In a few years, a women's highest institution of learning, worthy of worldly pride, will surely appear in Seoul. What joyous news this is! Let's write down what is known about the plans for Ewha Women's University.\n\n2\nEwha Women's University is planned to be built on a large hill in Sinch'on (新村) on the Kyŏngŭi Line (京義線) (about 10 *ri* west of Seoul), where Yŏnhŭi College (延禧專門學校) is currently located. The total area of the site reaches over 600,000 *p'yŏng*, and the building is said to be a four-story structure covering several thousand *p'yŏng*. Amidst the lush trees, there are plans for constructing athletic fields and a music hall, so geographically, one can infer it will be very spacious and<9> grand. It is said that Ewha Women's University will elevate the current college located in Chŏng-dong (貞洞) to create the main university course and additionally establish a preparatory course. If this happens, graduates of girls' higher common schools will enter the university's main course after about three years of preparatory studies, study diligently (硏讚) for another four years, and then graduate with a degree such as Bachelor of Arts (文學士) or another bachelor's title (學士). The current college is divided into three departments: English Literature, Music, and Home Economics. It is said that departments like Law or Commerce and Industry might be added. Also, there are currently over 200 students in the college, but it is not yet certain whether they will be transferred to the main course and new preparatory students recruited for the opening, or how it will be done.\nOriginally, Ewha Haktang was once called a women's university. Although it held that title since 1910 and educated students considering itself a university, the Government-General's Bureau of Education (總督府學務當局) did not recognize it. Thus, six years ago, in 1925, it inevitably became Ewha Women's College under the College Ordinance.\nFurthermore, to become a university, there must be a legal basic fund of over 1.5 million *won*, including the value of the buildings. To obtain this fund, the school principal, Miss Appenzeller (미쓰 아펜설라), has been back in the United States since last year, engaged in activities. Of the initially planned 400,000 dollars (i.e., 800,000 *won*) to be collected from America, 400,000-500,000 *won* has already been gathered, and it is said the remainder will likely be secured before long. <10> Just the other day, joyous news reportedly arrived at the school via undersea telegraph from the principal in New York, America, stating that another 100,000 *won* in donations had arisen, and the full amount would likely be reached in the near future. Therefore, on the day Miss Appenzeller returns home shortly with the large sum of 800,000 *won*, a majestic hall of learning for women will be constructed in Yŏnhŭi-myŏn, Sinch'on (延禧面 新村), marking a new era in women's culture.\nThe current principal, Miss Appenzeller, has American parents but was born in Korea. She has a deep understanding of Korea. Her father was the renowned Appenzeller (아펜설라), known as the first missionary to Korea. Her older brother is that Appenzeller (아펄셀라) who is the principal of Paejae Haktang (培材學堂). As all three family members have made exceptional contributions to Korea, hearing that Korea's first highest institution of learning, a women's university, is being established by her hands fills me with uncontrollable joy. How could I be the only one putting down my pen, hoping for its swift construction?\nThe other day, I sat in the back row at the foundation stone laying ceremony at the new Sinch'on site and couldn't contain my joyful feelings upon seeing the solemn yet beautiful ceremony and the outdoor play performed by the students. <11>\n<9-11>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis article from July 1930 announces the exciting news of the planned establishment of Ewha Women's University, set to be Korea's first and only university exclusively for women. The author, Pak Ŭnhŭi, recounts the history of Ewha Haktang since 1910, its previous designation as Ewha Women's College in 1925 due to lack of official recognition as a university by the Government-General, and the ongoing preparations for the new university. Details include the planned location on a large site in Sinch'on near Yŏnhŭi College, the potential structure of preparatory and main courses, and the existing departments (English, Music, Home Economics) with possible additions. The article highlights the fundraising efforts led by the principal, Miss Alice Appenzeller, in the United States, who had already secured a significant portion of the required 1.5 million *won* basic fund (collecting 800,000 *won*/$400,000 from the US). The author expresses great hope and joy for the project, also noting the Appenzeller family's long-standing contributions to Korean education and missions, and concluding with impressions from the recent foundation stone laying ceremony.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, the article is significant as it documents the aspiration and process of establishing the first women's university in colonial Korea, reflecting advancements in women's education despite limitations. It highlights the crucial role of foreign missionaries (specifically the Appenzeller family and Miss Price) and international fundraising (from the US) in developing Korean educational institutions. The mention of the Government-General's previous non-recognition and the stringent requirements for university status also reveals the constraints imposed by the colonial administration on higher education development.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n梨花女子大學\t이화여자대학\tIhwa Yŏja Taehak (Ewha Women's University)\n朴銀姬\t박은희\tPak Ŭnhŭi\n조선\t조선\tChosŏn (Korea)\n梨花學堂\t이화학당\tIhwa Haktang\n미쓰, 뿌라이쓰\t미스 프라이스\tMiss Price\n배재학당\t배재학당\tPaejae Haktang\n서울\t서울\tSŏul (Seoul)\n延禧專門學校\t연희전문학교\tYŏnhŭi Chŏnmun Hakkyo (Yonhui College)\n京義線\t경의선\tKyŏngŭi Line\n新村\t신촌\tSinch'on\n貞洞\t정동\tChŏng-dong\n총독부학무당국\t총독부 학무당국\tCh'ongdokpu Hakmu Tangguk (Government-General Bureau of Education)\n이화여자전문학교\t이화여자전문학교\tIhwa Yŏja Chŏnmun Hakkyo (Ewha Women's College)\n미쓰 아펜설라\t미스 아펜젤러\tMiss Appenzeller (Alice R.

The Philippine Archipelago has an area of 114,100 square *ri*, faces French Indochina, lies between Taiwan and the Dutch East Indies, and is formed by the largest gathering of islands in the Malay Archipelago. The current population is about 12.3 million people; after being under Spanish rule for about 330 years, it became an American territory about 30 years ago, and the majority of the population are Christians.\n\nIts independence movement was already fierce under the aforementioned Spanish rule; there was the fact that the revolutionary movement led by the famous Aguinaldo was greatly utilized by the United States during the Spanish-American War. Even after the United States came to possess the Philippines, the people's demand for independence did not lessen in the slightest. Because of this, it goes without saying that successive presidents since President McKinley have truly suffered great hardship in governing the Philippine Islands for over 30 years.\n\nAfter that, the beginning of the so-called Jones Act, which is said to have most greatly expanded Philippine autonomy, even pledged to \"recognize independence before long and abolish America's ruling power over the Philippines,\" but this remained a touchstone for the American people to resolve the independence issue.\n\nFurthermore, President Harding dispatched the Wood-Forbes commission to the Philippine Islands for an on-site investigation to determine the suitability of Philippine self-government, and subsequently, President Coolidge also dispatched the Thompson commission to investigate the general situation, but their reports merely recommended holding back independence under the pretext that it was \"premature.\"\n\nThat was a natural reason; although America's possession of the Philippines has the very respectable justification \"for the sake of humanity and for the spread of culture,\" its actual purpose is merely the necessity of possessing a point of access in the Far East to China, an important market for American goods.\n\nTo speak more concretely, at a time when Japan was rising, annexing Korea (조선) and obtaining Taiwan, while Germany established a foothold in Jiaozhou Bay and Russia advanced in the Siberia region, it was inevitable that America, seeking to extend the reach of its capitalism throughout China<12>, would necessarily focus on these Philippine Islands, which controlled the gateway to the Far East, and try to build its military base there; this is absolutely beyond doubt. For that reason, whatever the superficial justifications, the real cause of the Spanish-American War lay here. Considering such reasons, one can clearly surmise why America always hesitates on Philippine independence.\n\n2\nNow, there are various reasons why the Philippine populace holds anti-American feelings, starting with the Philippine sugar and oil manufacturing (ellipsis in original)... Thus, due to racial discrimination and economic and political oppression, the Philippine populace's movement for freedom has become increasingly fierce as the days go by. Back when the Spanish-American War concluded with the peace conference in Paris on December 10, 1898, and the United States was about to acquire the Philippine Archipelago by paying the Spanish government a price of 40 million dollars, the revolutionary hot-blood, Mr. Aguinaldo, had already cried out, \"What do we care who Spain gives it to? America buying it is also fine. But Manila must forever be Manila for Manila's sake!\" The indignation of the entire populace remains unchanged to this day, only intensifying*. Thus, \"Better these mountains and rivers be buried in the sea than become XX\"\nhas become their slogan. (*TN: The asterisk likely indicates missing text or refers to the intensity.) In this way, just as there has been a boycott alliance against British goods in India, a movement of the same kind is developing there. First, entering this year, they began the rejection of American-made cigarettes. Campaigners on the streets advise those seen smoking American cigarettes to stop, and if they still do not listen, they are knocked down on the spot, etc. Besides this, there was the large-scale student movement triggered by the insulting remarks made by the American teacher, Ms. Brunett(?), towards Filipinos; then the massive demonstration demanding the appointment of a Filipino Vice Governor-General; or the fact that at the First Philippine Independence Conference held in Manila on February 22nd last, Muslims (回敎族) and Moro(?) (몬로族), who had been seen by independence opponents in the US mainland as opposing Philippine independence, participated most earnestly in the said conference – all these facts prove that the voice demanding Philippine independence uniformly fills the entire islands.\n\nFurthermore, at the Third Conference of the Institute of Pacific Relations held in Kyoto this year, the Philippine representative criticized the attitude of the United States, which seeks to possess the Philippine Islands while ignoring their interests, stating:\n\"It is acceptable to ** Philippine-produced goods. It is also acceptable to reject Philippine<13> laborers. Only, make the Philippines independent before that. To take biased measures against goods produced or laborers living under the protection of the same American flag is morally unacceptable.\"\nHe expressed a very correct opinion. On the other hand, it is most noteworthy that the number of figures in political and business circles in America expressing agreement with Philippine independence is significantly increasing.\n\nThat is, recently in the US Senate Committee on Territories, the Philippine independence issue was deliberated, and Secretary of the Navy Adams and Undersecretary of the Army Davison, among others, attended the said meeting where defense issues, mainly concerning the case of permitting Philippine independence, were even discussed concretely. Also, there is the King Bill, which proposes to make the entire islands completely independent within 18 months after the Philippine independence bill passes the US Congress, or the Bingham Bill, which proposes granting President Hoover the right to convene a meeting of 8 Americans and 8 Filipinos in Manila on September 15th of this year to report to the US Congress regarding the future status of the Philippine Islands. Among these, regarding the King Bill in particular, Mr. Manuel Roxas, Chairman of the Philippine Independence Movement Committee and Speaker of the Lower House of the Philippine Assembly, has expressed great approval and is stating that the Philippine populace unanimously hopes for the passage of the King Bill.\n\n3\nThe aforementioned Mr. Manuel Roxas is currently the leader of the Philippine independence movement and stands in the position of spokesperson for the entire island populace. Introducing his recent opinions on this issue:\n\"Right now, the Filipino people are united, demanding immediate, absolute, and complete independence. Our demand for independence is proven by the numerous revolutions against Spain, and our constant struggle against America speaks to it as well. It is <15> certain that currently, the leaders of each faction and political party in the Philippine Assembly, as well as figures from all strata of agriculture, commerce, and industry, hope for separation from the United States. If there is anyone who doubts this even slightly, I believe it is right to determine the truth or falsehood through a plebiscite.\"\n\n\"There are those who doubt the political capacity of the Filipinos and speak of their presence or absence of experience, but we have shown splendid records in various fields over the past several decades. As for our national unity, nobody can doubt it now. Also, in terms of the spread of education, we are by no means lagging behind countries like Spain, Portugal, or Chile.\"\n\n\"The reason American imperialists opposing Philippine independence today give is the point of how the Philippines would maintain its freedom if it encounters foreign invasion. However, for that purpose, besides the League of Nations, there are the Permanent Court of International Justice and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which are sufficient to fully guarantee the Philippines' international status.\"\n\nIn short, the main point argued by the independence proponents of the Roxas faction is that the best preparation for independence for the Filipino people lies in independence itself.\n\nAnyway, at this time when the international political situation is changing surprisingly, the anti-American movement of the Philippine populace draws extreme attention. (This article is a translation. I trust it will be forgiven that, lacking a free pen, I took the path of translation.)<27>\n<12-15, 27>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis 1930 article from the Korean magazine *Samch'ŏlli* details the escalating anti-American independence movement in the Philippines. Written by \"Pacific Scholar,\" it outlines the history of US acquisition from Spain, acknowledges the long-standing Filipino desire for self-rule (citing Aguinaldo), and critiques US justifications for continued occupation, suggesting strategic interests (proximity to China market, countering Japan) are the real motives. The piece describes concrete forms of resistance like boycotts (cigarettes), student protests, and political demands, highlighting the growing unity among Filipinos, including Muslim and Moro groups previously seen as less supportive. It notes increasing support for independence within the US itself, mentioning specific legislative proposals (King Bill, Bingham Bill) and quoting Filipino leader Manuel Roxas's arguments for readiness and international guarantees (League of Nations, Kellogg-Briand Pact). The article explicitly draws a parallel with India's anti-British struggle. From a Korean colonial history perspective, this article is interesting as it shows Koreans under Japanese rule closely observing and reporting on another Asian nation's struggle against Western imperialism. The framing of US motives in relation to Japanese expansion (Korea, Taiwan) and the perceived hypocrisy of US rhetoric versus its actions (economic exploitation, racial discrimination) would resonate with a Korean audience facing similar issues under Japan. The concluding translator's note is also intriguing, hinting at potential censorship or the source material being non-Korean.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n比律賓\t필리핀\tPhilippines\n印度\t인도\tIndia\n太平洋\t태평양\tPacific Ocean\n臺灣\t대만\tTaiwan\n蘭領東印度\t난령동인도\tDutch East Indies\n馬來群島\t마래군도\tMalay Archipelago\n西班牙\t서반아\tSpain\n美國\t미국\tUnited States (America)\n아기날드\t아기날드\tAguinaldo\n美西戰爭\t미서전쟁\tSpanish-American War\n막키레-\t맥킨리\tMcKinley\n쫀-스 법안\t존스 법안\tJones Act\n하-딩\t하딩\tHarding\n웃드·포-뿌스\t우드 포브스\tWood-Forbes\n쿨-닛지\t쿨리지\tCoolidge\n톰부손\t톰프슨\tThompson\n亞米利加\t아메리카\tAmerica\n中國\t중국\tChina\n日本\t일본\tJapan\n朝鮮\t조선\tKorea (Chosŏn)\n獨逸\t독일\tGermany\n膠州灣\t교주만\tJiaozhou Bay\n露西亞\t노서아\tRussia\n西伯利亞\t서백리아\tSiberia\n極東\t극동\tFar East\n巴里\t파리\tParis\n마니라\t마닐라\tManila\n부룬웟트\t브루넷?\tBrunett?

통하야 세상에서는 이미 다 알 터이지만은 印度의 민족적 독립운동이 아조 그 불길을 놉히어 排英的 공기가 全土에 뻐치어 白熱化하고 잇는 이때에 또 太平洋의 一角에도 민족자결의 소리가 놉히 절규되어 反美熱이 比律賓全島에 이러나고 잇는 것을 우리들은 목도하고 잇는 터이다.\n그런데 이제 이 운동의 현황을 기술하기 전에 위선 比律賓의 유래부터 잠간 비치고 나가는 것이 순서이리라. 比律賓群島는 지역이 114,100평방리요 佛領印度支那를 상대하야 臺灣과 蘭領東 印度의 중간에 잇서서 馬來群島 中 가장 큰 島嶼가 모히여 듼 곳이다. 인구는 현재 약 1,230여만명인 바 그동안에 330여년간을 西班牙의 지배을 밧다가 약 30년전에 美領이 되엇섯든데 인구의 태반은 기독교도들이다.\n그 독립운동은 벌서 前記西班牙의 治下의 잇슬 때부터 맹렬하게 잇섯스니 저 유명한 「아기날드」를 두령으로 한 혁명운동은 美西전쟁 때에 미국에 의하야 크게 이용당한 사실도 잇섯다. 그 뒤 미국이 比律賓을 領有하게 된 뒤에도 그 인민의 독립요구는 조곰도 輕減치 안엇다. 이 때문에 「막키레-」대통령 이후 30여년간 역대의 대통령은 比島를 다스려 가기에 실로 고심 참담하 바 잇든 것은 물론이다.\n그 뒤 比律賓의 자치권을 가장 만히 확대하엿다는 소위 「쫀-스」법안의 冒頭에는 「이리하야 未幾에 독립을 승인하고 比律賓에 대한 미국의 통치권을 철폐」할 것을 서약까지 하엿든 것이나 이것은 여전히 독립 문제를 해결할 美國民의 試金石으로 남엇든 문제이엇다.\n더욱 이미 比律賓自治의 適否를 결정하고저 「하-딩」대통령은 「웃드·포-뿌스」위원을 比島에 實地派遺하엿고 그 다음에 「쿨-닛지」대통령도 「톰부손」위원을 派遺하여 그 일반 상태를 조사식히엇스나 그 復命은 모다 「시기상조」라는 이유아래에 독립보유를 建言하엿슴에 불과하엿다.\n그것은 당연한 이유엇스니 미국의 比律賓領有는 가장 체면이 조흔 「人道를 위하야 그리고 문화의 보급을 위하야」라 함이 잇스나 그 실상 목적은 亞米利加의 중요한 상품시장인 중국에 접근하는 지점을 극동에 잇서서 가지고 잇슬 필요로 점유함에 불과한 것이다.\n다시 구체적으로 말하면 당시 일본이 擡頭하야 조선을 倂合하고 臺灣을 獲하는 한편 독일이 膠州灣에 地盤을 닥고 露西亞는 西伯利亞方面에 진전한 결과 그 자본주의의 手足을 中國全土에 펴려하든 미국이＜12＞ 필연적으로 極東의 門戶를 扼하고 잇는 이 比律賓에 着目하고 그 군사적 근거를 싸흐려 할 것이 절대로 의심할 여지업는 일이리라 아니할 수 업다. 그런 까닭으로 표면의 이유는 엇잿스나 좌우간 美西전쟁의 원인도 실상은 여기에 잇섯든 것이다. 그러한 이유를 따저 볼 때에 美國이 比律賓독립에 항상 주저하는 까닭이 뚜렷하게 짐작할 수 잇다.\n\n2\n이제 比律賓민중이 反美感情을 가지는 이유는 여러 가지가 잇겟스나 爲先 比島의 製糖製油가(중략-원문) 이리하야 인종적 차별과 경제적 정치적의 압박으로 比律賓민중은 날이 갈사록 자유의 운동을 맹렬히 이르키어 왓스니 저 1898년 12월 10일에 美西전쟁이 결과을 지어 巴里에서 강화회의 끗헤 美國이 西班牙정부에 4천만원의 대가를 지불하고 比律賓群島로 領有하려할 때에 벌서 혁명의 열혈아「애기날드」씨는 「西斑牙가 누구에게 주든지 우리는 상관할 것 무엇이랴. 미국이 이것을 사는 것도 可하다. 그러나 마니라(比律賓의 수도)는 언제까지든지 마니라때문의 마니라!가 아니어서는 아니된다.」하고 절규하엿든 것인데 全民衆의 痛憤은 오늘까지 변한 바 업시 더욱 *열할 뿐이다. 그래서 「XX이 되지 안을 진대 차라리 이 山川이 바다 가운데 매몰하여 버려라.」\n함이 그네의 표어가 되어 왓다. 이리하야 印度의 英國商品에 대한 非買동맹이 잇서 오드시 거기에도 同種類의 운동이 전개되고 잇다. 爲先 금년에 드러서 그네들은 미국제의 卷煙草排斥을 시작하엿다. 운동원은 街頭에서 美國製卷煙草를 먹고 잇는 자를 보면 그 喫煙中止를 勸告하고 만일 그래도 듯지 안는 경우에는 그 자리에 때려눕히는 등 이밧게도 미국인교사 「부룬웟트」여사가 比島人에 대하야 모욕적 言辭를 쓴 때문에 端緖를 發한 대규모의 학생운동 그러고는 比律賓人의 부총독 취임을 요망하는 대대적 시위운동 또는 지난 2월 22일에 마니라에 열닌 제1회 比島獨立會議에서 美本國의 독립반대론자가 比島의 독립에 반대하야 온다고 보아오든 回敎族이나 몬로族이 가장 열심하게 仝大會에 참가한 일 등 이 모든 사실은 比島의 독립을 요구하는 소리가 全島에 一致 꽉 드려찬 것을 증명하는 것이리라.\n더욱 금년에 京都에 열니엇든 太平洋問題 第3回 總會席上에서 比律賓대표는 美國이 比島의 이익을 무시하는 태도를 가지면서 오히려 此를 領有하려 하는 태도를 비난하야\n「比島」생산의 物産에 **하는 것은 可하다. 또 比島人＜13＞ 노동자를 排斥하는 것은 可하다. 단지 그 이전에 比島를 독립식혀라 그러치안코 가튼 美國旗의 보호하에 생산이 되는 物資 또는 생존하는 노동자에 대하야 偏頗한 處置에 나오는 일은 도리상 허락할 수 업다\n하고 매우 올흔 의견을 開陳하엿는데 한편 美國에도 比島의 독립에 讚意를 표하고 잇는 人士가 정계와 실업계에 훨신 만허 가는 것이 가장 吾人의 주목을 끄으는 바이다.\n즉 최근에 美國上院領土委員會에서는 比律賓독립문제가 심의되어 仝會議에 「아담쓰」해군장관과 육균차관 「다비손」씨 등이 列席하야 主로 比島의

Power and individuals inevitably move together; this was the reason for the anticipation of or worship of heroes (英雄待望, 英雄崇拜) in past ages, and it is the reason why the strength of organization and outstanding leaders are demanded and revered in the modern era. Whether the hero makes the times or the times make the hero is already a cliché, but if one only looks superficially at the circumstances of the age revolving around individuals and power at its center, the question of whether it is the hero or the age may indeed arise. In short, the situation unfolds and revolves only when power is concentrated and controlled through social and popular trust and unity, with a certain principle and goal as the core, and when this is historically expressed and utilized. However, this concentration and growth of power is not an easy matter.\n\n2\nWhere there is no development of theory, a social will cannot be established, and where there is no concretizing movement, the development and unification of theory cannot exist either; it is an inevitable fate that the concentration and control of power cannot arise from there. Therefore, a single power grows centered around some institution, and individuals also grow following it. If there is no oppression or interference chasing after this, if social poverty does not hinder its smooth operation and success, and if the social cooperation of the people, through trust and encouragement towards it, establishes a core for society and gives the people something to rely on, this will be the precious and difficult fortune of the age and the people, and the development of the situation will find its main axis. Oppression can bring about reactionary development, but it is not the same depending on its severity. Poverty is originally a social evil, and the extreme poverty of an unorganized people cannot, as it is, be formed into controlled power. There are those who say that so-called struggle in the world is a procedural means to concentrate and grow power through social settlement, overcoming, and control, but there will be no harvest other than mutual distrust, mutual slander, and mutual destruction and ruin. Private quarrels (私爭) are ultimately private quarrels and cannot become struggle in a strict sense.\n\n3\nOppression is a social evil; those who hold the reins of power (權柄) should consider this carefully even for their own sake. However, in a society facing many difficulties, as soon as power reaches a certain stage of growth, storms (風霜) suddenly sweep in. Power and individuals alike<14> are caught in this obstacle, and as poverty follows them, they naturally fall into a tendency of depression and weakness. Moreover, the muddy stream of distrust, slander, and mutual exposure flows turbulently in between, eating away at the core and rotting the foundation, causing society to lose its center and the people to not know what to rely on. Therefore, regardless of the society or people, if oppression, poverty, and slander are at work, they will be pointed out as the three obstacles to the concentration of power and the growth of individuals. Thus, where the storms strike, the high are broken and the prominent fall, so power and individuals cannot grow strong. In the desolate wilderness (曠野), only crowds in shabby clothes (弊衣) with pale faces (菜色) wander aimlessly; without preparations for organization, poverty is merely an evil. Just as the fisherman by the river rejoices in the profit gained from sitting idly while others fight (漁夫之利), mutual slander and mutual exposure are nothing but acts of social suicide. The heedless run about in a daze, while the concerned lament aloud in broad daylight. The great sage is like a fool, seeing the larger picture, enduring to seek synthesis. Where petty talents engage in trivial carving (雕瑑), boasting, and engaging in self-praise and [obscured negative action], the east wind blows fiercely, causing the remaining flowers to all fall. When will fruition come? With whom will it be achieved? (remainder omitted-original text) <15>\n\n**Summary**\n\nAn Chaehong argues that the success of any social or popular movement hinges on the concentration and control of collective power (力量), centered around strong theory, organization, and leadership. He identifies three major obstacles hindering this process in contemporary Korean society: external oppression (억압), widespread poverty (빈곤), and internal division manifested as mutual distrust, slander, and exposure (不信任, 中傷, 相互暴露). An laments that these factors prevent the growth of strong leadership and unified power, comparing infighting to social suicide and warning that continued division prevents any meaningful progress or \"fruition\" for the movement. This article is historically significant as it reflects the internal debates and frustrations within the Korean nationalist movement during the colonial period, highlighting the crippling effects of both Japanese colonial policy and the factionalism that plagued Korean organizations striving for independence or social change. Historians can gain insight into the perceived challenges and the urgent calls for unity among Korean intellectuals and activists in 1930.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n安在鴻\t안재홍\tAn Chaehong\n\n**Glossary**\n\n運動\t운동\tMovement (social, political)\n力量集中\t역량집중\tConcentration of power/capabilities\n밋\t및\tAnd (older spelling of 및)\n비롯오\t비로소\tOnly then, for the first time (older spelling/form of 비로소)\n展開發展\t전개발전\tUnfolding and development\n딸어서\t따라서\tFollowing, according to (older spelling of 따라서)\n움즉이는\t움직이는\tMoving (older spelling of 움직이는)\n잇서\t있어\tBeing, existing (older spelling of 있어)\n時勢\t시세\tThe times, current situation\n핵심삼어\t핵심삼아\tMaking something the core (older form)\n엇는다하면\t얻는다면\tIf one obtains/gains (older spelling/form of 얻는다면)\n쪼처옴이\t쫓아옴이\tChasing/following (older spelling/form of 쫓아옴이)\n업고\t없고\tNot having, without (older spelling of 없고)\n업는\t없는\tThat which does not exist/have (older spelling of 없는)\n잇슬\t있을\tWill be, can exist (older spelling of 있을)\n빈곤\t빈곤\tPoverty, destitution\n조성순성\t조성순성\tAssisting and enabling smooth progress\n依據\t의거\tBasis, grounds; something to rely on\n반발적\t반발적\tReactionary, defiant\n안코\t않고\tNot doing (older spelling of 않고)\n밧게\t밖에\tOutside of, other than (older spelling of 밖에)\n收穫\t수확\tHarvest, gain, achievement\n업슬\t없을\tWill not be, cannot be (older spelling of 없을)\n私爭\t사쟁\tPrivate quarrel/dispute\n權柄\t권병\tReins of power, authority\n風霜\t풍상\tWind and frost; hardships, trials\n銷沈\t소침\tDepression, dejection\n濁流\t탁류\tMuddy stream, turbulent times\n滾滾하게\t곤곤하게\tTurbulently, rolling profusely\n盤\t반\tFoundation, base (here likely referring to the base/foundation of the movement)\n中樞\t중추\tCenter, pivot, nucleus\n曠野\t광야\tWilderness, vast empty field\n弊衣\t폐의\tShabby/worn-out clothes\n菜色\t채색\tPale/unhealthy complexion (literally 'vegetable color', implying malnutrition)\n籌備\t주비\tPreparation, planning\n漁夫之利\t어부지리\tReaping benefits from the conflict of others (like the fisherman in the fable)\n坐古\t좌고\tSit and wait/watch (likely refers to sitting idly while others fight, reaping the benefit '漁夫之利')\n浩嘆\t호탄\tDeep sigh, lamentation\n大賢\t대현\tGreat sage, wise person\n愚\t우\tFoolishness, stupidity\n合成\t합성\tSynthesis, combination\n小才\t소재\tPetty talent/person of small abilities\n雕瑑\t조전\tTrivial carving/engraving; focusing on minor details, petty matters\n揚揚\t양양\tTriumphantly, boastfully\n殘花\t잔화\tRemaining flowers\n結實\t결실\tFruition, bearing fruit\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n잡지명\t삼천리 제7호\n발행일\t1930년 07월 01일\n기사제목\t우리 運動과 力量集中問題\n필자\t安在鴻\n기사형태\t논설\n\n우리 運動과 力量集中問題\n\t\t\t\t\t\t安在鴻\n1\n一社會 一人民의 운동은 사회적 또는 인민적 역량의 집중 통제 밋 그 표현 활동을 기대려 비롯오 展開發展되는 것이다. 역량과 인물은 반듯이 딸어서 움즉이는 것이니 前代에 잇서 英雄待望 또는 英雄崇拜의 이유로 된 바이오 현대에 잇서 조직의 힘과 밋 우수한 지도자가 요구되고 또 敬仰되는 이유이다. 영웅이 時勢를 짓느냐 時勢가 영웅을 짓느냐는 이미 진부한 말이지만 인물과 역량을 중심으로 그의 周團에서 回轉되는 時代情勢를 皮相으로만 보면 미상볼 영웅이냐 시대이냐의 문제가 붓기도 하는 것이다. 요컨대 일정한 주의와 목표를 핵심삼어 사회적 인민적의 신뢰 결합으로 역량이 집중통제되고 그것이 역사적으로 표현 활용되매 비롯오 시국이 展開 回轉하는 것이다. 그러나 이 역량의 集中生長은 용이한 문제가 아니다.\n\n2\n이론의 展開가 업는 곳에 사회적 意志가 수립될 수 업고 구체화하는 운동이 안되는 곳에 또 이론의 전개 밋 통일이 잇슬 수 업는 것이니 거긔서 역량의 집중 통제가 생길 수 업는 것은 필연한 운명이다. 그런고로 일개의 역량은 어떠한 기관을 중심으로 생장되고 인물이 또 그를 딸아서 생장하는 것이니 여긔에 억압간섭이 쪼처옴이 업고 사회적 빈곤이 그의 동작을 助成順成함을 저해함도 업고 인민의 사회적 협동이 그에 대한 신뢰 助長으로써 하야 사회가 핵심이 서고 인민은 依據를 엇는다하면 이는 곳 시대 인민의 존귀 重難한 행운이 될 것이오 시국의 발전은 그 主軸을 엇는 것이다. 억압이 반발적 발전을 오게 하는 수 잇스되 그는 그 輕重을 딸아 동일하지 안코 빈곤을 원래 사회적 害惡이어서 無組織한 인민의 甚大한 빈곤은 그대로 통제적인 역량으로 결성될 수 업는 바이며 세간의 소위 투쟁이 사회적 淸算 克服 밋 통제로 역량을 集中生長케 하는 一過程的 수단이라 하는 자 잇스나 그러나 相互不信任과 相互中傷과 相互暴破毁에 밧게 아무 收穫이 업슬 것이다. 私爭은 결국 私爭이어서 嚴正한 의미로 투쟁이 될 수 업는 것이다.\n\n3\n억압은 사회적 害惡이니 權柄을 잡은 자 그 자체를 위하야서도 愼重 고려할 바일 것이다. 그러나 多難한 사회에는 力量이 一定한 生長의 계단에 일으매 문득 風霜이 몰어닥치는 바 잇스니 力量과 人物이 아울러＜14＞ 그 障害에 걸리는 바이오 빈곤함이 그들을 딸으매 스사로 銷沈 貧弱의 傾向에 빠지는 것이며 하물며 불신임 中傷 相互暴露의 濁流가 그 사이에 滾滾하게 심드는 바 잇서 그 핵심을 좀먹고 盤은 썩으며 사회가 中樞를 일코 인민은 依據를 모르게 되는 것이다. 그럼으로 어느 사회 어느 인민임을 못지 말고 만일 억압 빈곤 中傷이 작용되는 바 잇다하면 그는 곳 역량집중과 인물생장의 三件障害라고 따지게 될 것이다. 그러하야 風霜의 치는 곳에 놉흔 자 꺽기고 웃둑한 자 넘어지니 역량과 인물이 꿋꿋이 자라날 수 업고 적막한 曠野에 오즉 弊衣 菜色의 떼가 彷徨하니 조직의 籌備가 업시는 貧困이 오즉 害惡일 뿐이며 漁夫江干에서 손을 처 그 坐古하는 利를 깃버하니 相互中傷과 相互暴露는 오직 사회적의 자살행위일 뿐이라 무심한 자 夢中에 뛰고 유심한 자 白日에 浩嘆하는 바일 것이다. 大賢은 愚와 가트니 大局을 보는지라 忍하야 合成을 꾀하고 小才는 雕瑑을 일삼는지라 揚揚하고 **하야 **를 일삼는 곳에 동풍이 사나워서 殘花를 다 떨어트리니 結實은 언제 할 것이냐? 누구로 더불어 할 것이냐?(하략-원문)＜15＞\n＜14-15＞","magazine":"삼천리 제7호","date":"1930년 07월 01일","title":"Our Movement and the Problem of Concentrating Strength"},{"path":"07_1930.07/110.txt","issue":"07_1930.07","content":"A Proposal Regarding the Social Movement\n\t\t\t\t\t\tKim Kyŏngjae\n\n1\nRecently, my life, though not busy due to any specific requirements, is somehow busy without me knowing why. Thus, I lack the leisure time to think and ponder. Amidst this, a request for a manuscript arrived from Samch'ŏllisa (三千里社). They need me to prepare an article on the topic of \"Strategy for the Chosŏn Social Movement\" by 9 AM tomorrow.\n\nEven working continuously without sleep or rest, I only have about 11 hours. Furthermore, there are many difficulties for me in handling this issue at present.\n\nFirstly, as I was isolated from the world until last autumn, I must be accordingly ignorant of world affairs.\n\nSecondly, since I have no connection with any organization, I subjectively lack experience in the current situation.\n\nBeing thus ignorant of the objective situation and subjectively lacking connection with the movement's organizations presently, my practical experience is weak, so how could I possibly speak of the movement's methods?\n\nAnd thirdly, I am a person from the former Hwayohoe (火曜會) faction.\n\nAlthough unification appears on the surface now, with dispersed and opposing factions concentrated under the banner of a Single Party (單一黨), if one probes internally, doesn't the unresolved residue of factionalism (派的의 殘滓) still remain?\n\nHence, I am not the right person to handle this issue.\n\n2\nA Single National Party (民族單一黨)—the impression is good just hearing the words. Who would not have wanted it or waited for it? Especially when our meager strength was divided seven or eight ways, split here and there, with mutual conflict and antagonism growing day by day, we longed for it as if one moment lasted three autumns.<16>\n\nHowever, in reality, can a Single National Party be achieved? And has there been such a precedent in other countries? Within a nation reside various classes whose interests conflict. Can they be gathered together and formed into a single party?\n\nThe complete formation of a single national party yields the result of diminishing that nation's [censored] power (XX력 減殺). Division stemming from feudalistic psychology is an unforgivable sin. Nevertheless, demanding unification and consolidation despite significant ideological disparities is extremely foolish. More than foolish, it is entirely impossible in reality. Even if it were achieved due to certain circumstances and situations, it would be abnormal and deformed.\n\nIn what respect do I say it diminishes [censored] power (XX력의 減殺)? Although I hesitate to point out the appropriate example here due to unavoidable circumstances and situations, isn't it a fact when comparing today with the time when various past organizations stood opposed? That being said, such division as in the past should be rejected, but isn't the process of differentiation (분해작용) that should rightly lead to separate standing (分立) a natural destination and also what we desire? Isn't that the way to give vitality to today's stagnant movement and allow it to advance?\n\n3\nFrom concept to reality—that seems to be the biggest issue confronting us right now. Although concepts cannot be entirely separated from reality, haven't we in the past neglected reality too much?\n\nOr rather, isn't it that all things have their own stages (階梯), and now is precisely the time and stage to turn our attention to reality and steer the rudder (舵) in that direction? Isn't the struggle for immediate interests urgently demanded of us? Some speak of economic movements, others of political movements. However, Chosŏn is a special region, subject to special circumstances, and thus, none of Chosŏn's movements have been anything but political movements. Although one might be able to distinguish them if forced, the boundary line is said to be vastly different from that in other countries.\n\nThere is one issue here: focusing too much on the movement for reality might lead to the annihilation of the masses' [censored] power (대중의 XX력 沫殺). However, the masses are not a concept. There is proper progress and true strength derived from experiencing reality. There comes a day when the masses inevitably feel weary of concepts. Thus, the natural form of becoming a Reality Movement (現實運動化) emerges. (End)<17>\n\n**Summary**\n\nKim Kyŏngjae expresses skepticism about the viability and desirability of a single, unified national party (民族單一黨) for the Chosŏn social movement. Writing as a former member of the Hwayohoe faction, he argues that forcing unity upon groups with fundamentally different interests and ideologies is unrealistic and counterproductive, potentially leading to stagnation and the weakening of the movement's actual power (referred to cryptically as XX력). He contends that while past fragmentation was problematic, a necessary \"differentiation\" (분해작용) based on real differences is natural and needed for progress. Kim advocates for shifting focus from abstract concepts to concrete, immediate struggles (\"reality\"), acknowledging that in Chosŏn's unique colonial context, all social movements inevitably become political. Historically, this article is significant as it reflects the internal debates and persistent factionalism (despite nominal unity efforts like the Sin'ganhoe, which this likely alludes to) within the Korean nationalist and socialist movements during the colonial period.

Mr. Yi Yongik presented several calf-sized gold nuggets from the Kapsan Gold Mine (甲山金鑛) to the Emperor Emeritus and Empress Myŏngsŏng. Also, when Empress Myŏngsŏng was forced by the power of the Daewŏn'gun (大院君) to hide herself in her hometown of Yŏju in the middle of the night, he, with his extraordinary physical strength (臂力), carried the Queen like a flying bird, traveling a thousand li in a day (日行千里), becoming known to the world by the name of the strongman (力士). <18> At that time, Song Pyŏngjun (宋秉晙) was considered the most handsome in face and bearing, but for manliness, strength, and strategic acumen, Mr. Yi Yongik was rated highest. His appearance was remarkable, and his height reached six *ch'ŏk*, a fine figure of a man (好丈夫).\n\nTherefore, as Empress Myŏngsŏng was a central figure of the pro-Russian faction, Mr. Yi Yongik also joined the pro-Russian faction, and these two great figures seemed poised to determine the fate of the Chosŏn peninsula, wielding political power over this land for a time. Their activities during that period are a part of Chosŏn's modern history itself. How could one record all the twists and turns here? However, focusing on the ninety thousand yen incident that astonished the world, surrounding the large sum of about 900,000 yen—comprising the 330,000 yen Mr. Yi Yongik deposited in the First Bank (第一銀行) when he went into exile overseas, plus interest—I intend to write about the turbulent circumstances surrounding him. Indeed, the mention of 900,000 yen makes one's heart grow cold due to the sheer amount.\n\n400,000 yen! That was 400,000 yen 22 or 23 years ago. Anyone who has lived long can easily imagine, but at that time, one *sŏm* of rice cost 2-3 won, a day's field labor 10-20 won, and with just one *ryang* of money, one could explore the taverns within the capital city for two or three days with plenty to spare. Compared to today's prices, it was truly a hundredth or even a thousandth of the value. Thus, 400,000 yen back then would indeed be worth more than 4 million yen, perhaps even more than 40 million yen in today's common paper money. How did this elder, Yi Yongik, come to deposit such a large sum? This is truly an intriguing question.\n\nLet us then begin by getting to know the figure of Yi Yongik, the extraordinary man of his time.\n\nHis Childhood Years\nMr. Yi Yongik was born in Myŏngch'ŏn (明川), Hamgyŏng North Province. Where Paektu Mountain rushes towards the East Sea (東海) like a thousand-li stream, pauses briefly as if to rest, forming a wide, flat plain (平野), there lies Ch'ilbo Mountain (七寶山), famous for its beautiful springs and rocks (泉石). Crossing one pass over that mountain leads to a small village called Haga-myŏn (下加面), which was the birthplace of the great man who would later make the world weep.\n\nPerhaps because he was strong from a young age, he often got into fights. Growing up in a humble rural family, how could he have had the opportunity for proper studies? When he was very young, under ten, his daily routine involved leading village children to the riverbank to play mock cavalry battles on willow horses, with him as the general, engaging in team fights, or throwing stones to break neighbors' pottery jars in their yards, or wrestling. As he grew a little older, his days were often spent drinking and frequenting *kolp'ae* (골패, dominoes), *t'uch'ŏn* (투전, card game), and *changgi* (장기, Korean chess) gambling dens. However, even in gambling, he didn't try to win through skill or cunning like others.\n\nIndeed, almost naively honest, he often fell for the tricks of the village children and usually ended up losing all the money he had earned through great hardship. Then, laughing heartily, he would sit until the game was almost over, roll up his sleeves, and shout,\n\"Alright, take this!\"\nThen he would strike down all ten or twenty people at the table at once, grab all the money—be it fifty *ryang* or a hundred *ryang*—wrap the strings of coins tightly around his waist, and disappear like a flying bird, leaping over neighbors' walls and fences without a trace.\nThis point was exactly like Mr. Son Pyŏnghŭi's (孫秉熙) youth.\nThus, he earned a reputation throughout Myŏngch'ŏn county as a troublemaker good at fighting and gambling.\n\nAt seventeen or eighteen, harboring an unusual ambition, he went to the Kapsan Gold Mine (甲山金鑛) in Hamgyŏng South Province and threw himself into gold prospecting. At that time, Unsan (雲山) in P'yŏngan Province and Kapsan were known as the places where gold was most abundant. During his few years there, he managed to get his hands on a gold nugget the size of a calf. Anyone else holding such a gold ingot would likely have thought of buying fields and houses. But he wrapped it tightly in a bundle, slung it over his shoulder, and walked the thousand-li road to the palace in Seoul. His intention was to offer the gold nugget to the nation, to be used for the national treasury (國庫) <19> — truly an astonishing idea.\n\nThe King received the gold and summoned Yi Yongik. Seeing that his words were unadorned, his physique imposing, and his character bold, deeming him potentially useful talent for the state (國家有用之材), he immediately appointed him to the post of Gate Guard Commander (守門將). From then on, Mr. Yi Yongik had many opportunities to meet Empress Myŏngsŏng, and Her Majesty came to trust him dearly.\n\nDuring this time, one day, trouble broke out within Kyŏngbok Palace. The Daewŏn'gun, who had been relieved of his regency (攝政) and was staying at his mountain villa (山莊) in Kongdŏk-ri (孔德里), led troops (兵馬) like a cloudburst into Kyŏngbok Palace. (Omission - Original Text) At that time, political power (政權) was almost entirely in the hands of Empress Myŏngsŏng, known as the heroine of the East (東洋의 女傑), so the Daewŏn'gun intended to drive out the Empress and personally assume control of state affairs (大政) as before. (Abbreviation - Original Text)\n\nCaught unprepared by the sudden turn of events, the Empress's personal safety was truly in peril (危殆). Had she delayed even for a moment (寸刻), unimaginable terrible danger (危險) might have befallen her. The night was deep in the third watch (三更), the world (天地) was quiet, but inside the palace, there was tumultuous chaos (騷亂). The royal concubines (嬪妃) attending the Queen were beside themselves, stamping their feet and weeping.\n\nOn the veranda (廊下) of the bedchamber (寢殿), too, the sounds of sorrowful and frightened weeping (泣聲) were mournful. Gold, silver, and jade ornaments (金銀玉佩) worn by the court ladies and maids (宮女侍女) lay scattered about, as if the final tragic day had arrived. At that moment, a tall man, some six *ch'ŏk* in height, prostrated himself before the Queen like a flying bird, pledging to save her from this crisis. Then, escorting the Queen, he leaped over the high palace walls and vanished without a trace, like the wind.\n\nBefore and After the Tragic Palace Upheaval\nIt goes without saying that he was Yi Yongik. That night, escorting the Queen, he moved with the speed of a flying bird, passing Yukcho Street, exiting through Tongdaemun Gate, leaving Tonggwan behind, heading through Kwangnaru to Songp'a (松坡), and finally reaching the Queen's hometown, Yŏju-ŭp, in one breath. When he set the Queen down on the ground there, the first rooster crowed twice in the distance, and the dawn broke brightly. It is said that he covered over a hundred *li* in that single night.\n\nNot long after this palace upheaval (宮變)—too sorrowful to be called a tragedy (悲劇), too solemn (嚴肅) to be called a comedy (喜劇)—time began to flow smoothly again, and Empress Myŏngsŏng returned to the palace (還宮). At that time, the Empress was deeply moved (感動) by Yi Yongik's loyalty (忠誠) and manly spirit (氣槪), naturally. Upon her return, she appointed him county magistrate (郡守) of some county, then governor (府使) of Pukch'ŏng (北靑), and soon summoned him to the palace, appointing him tax supervisor (稅監) for all the nation's gold mines (全國 金鑛). It is said that Mr. Yi Yongik occasionally went back to the Kapsan Gold Mine, where he had once wandered as a gold prospector (金鑛軍), excavated many calf-sized gold nuggets, and presented them to the state.\n\nAfter that, his career took off like a ship with a fair wind. He achieved a level of worldly success (榮達) rarely seen, reportedly holding eight or nine famous official posts simultaneously at one point, including Director of the Palace Treasury (內藏院卿) and Minister of War (軍部大臣). People still abound in Seoul today who saw him when he was Minister of War, gathering many soldiers at the Samsanp'yŏng field (三山坪, now a pasture, 牧場) outside Tongdaemun Gate for modern military drills (操練). Wearing a large decoration (勳章) on his chest and a military uniform (軍服), he would occasionally appear at the site (臨場). Everyone was said to be naturally overawed (威壓) by his imposing and dignified (威風堂堂) bearing.\n\nBeing a man of caliber, once he could wield his statesmanship (經綸) to some extent, he diligently associated with many private scholars and activists (民間의 志士) and did not neglect establishing many schools (學校) and enlightenment organizations (開化機關). Indeed, Mr. Yi Chongho, who could be called a pioneer of modern education (近世 敎育), might not have been able to spend such huge sums of capital (巨額의 資金) on his endeavors (事業) had he not had such an understanding grandfather (祖父).\n\nThen, amidst the turbulent winds of the late Korean Empire, he fled far beyond the country's borders (國外). The money left behind at that time was 340,000 yen in cash deposited (預金) in the First Bank (第一銀行). Whether he left the money in the country (國內) with the intention of helping his beloved grandson (孫子) Yi Chongho's endeavors, or whether he was determined to step onto Seoul's soil (土地) again someday and use it, or whether the pursuing dark hand (黑手) was so pressing (急迫) that he had no time to withdraw (探知) it—in any case, <20> leaving behind an eternal mystery (疑問), the enormous sum of 400,000 yen sank deep into the bank's vault (金庫).\nThis was the initial trigger (發端) for the 900,000 yen incident that startled the world.\n\nHowever, another complication (變故) arose here. In October of Meiji 42, the year *sullyŏnhae* (戌年亥, likely a typo for 己酉, 1909), Itō Hirobumi died in Harbin (哈爾濱). Mr. Yi Chongho was arrested as a suspect (嫌疑者) in that incident (事變) and imprisoned (監獄). Later, he was released when the suspicion was cleared. By then, the general situation had already become decisive. Realizing he could no longer stay inside the country, Mr. Yi Chongho went to China (中國). He first went to Peking (北京), but finding it unsafe there too, he moved again, passing through Qingdao (靑島) and then on to Shanghai (上海). Finding that also unsafe, he went to Siberia (西伯利亞) and Vladivostok (海參威). After several years, he returned to Peking and Shanghai, but in Shanghai, he was arrested by Japanese authorities (日本官憲) and brought back to Seoul. Upon arrival, he was subjected to residential restrictions (居住制限) and confined to his hometown (故鄕), Myŏngch'ŏn (明川). Fortunately, this restriction was lifted, and when he reappeared in Seoul, the thought that occurred to him was to claim the aforementioned deposit. So, he immediately crossed over to Tokyo (東京) and engaged in various activities (活動). (Omission - Original Text)\n\nThere, he met Song Pyŏngjun (宋秉畯). Song, when he was Minister of Home Affairs (內部大臣), had schemed (策動) with all sorts of plots (陰謀) to seize this money, so his relationship with Mr. Yi must have been like fire and water (水火之間). At that time, Song reportedly said, \"In the past (過去), I harbored improper intentions (不測之心) regarding that money, but I was completely wrong. Let's wash away the feelings from that time in water, and from now on, I will do my utmost to help you recover the money,\" even apologizing (謝罪) for his wrongdoing. However, Song Pyŏngjun passed away to the other world not long after, and Mr. Yi Chongho, with unsatisfactory results (結果), returned from Tokyo.\n\nWhat Will Happen to the Money?\nVarious speculations (觀測) circulate in the world centered around this money. Among those who believe the money cannot be recovered, the arguments are:\n1. According to bank regulations (規則), if the depositor (預金主) has been missing (行方不明) for more than ten years?, the money is confiscated (沒收) by the national treasury (國庫). Therefore, according to the rules, it would be difficult.\n2. Was the huge sum of over 300,000 yen Mr. Yi Yongik's personal wealth (私財) at that time, or could it have been imperial household money (皇室 돈) or national treasury funds (國庫金), given that he was the Director of the Palace Treasury?\nOn the other hand, those who argue that it should undoubtedly be recoverable say:\n1. Although the bank regulations state as much, it depends on the circumstances (事情) during that period. The depositor was not given the opportunity (機會) to claim the deposit due to major upheavals (天變), so it cannot be seen as the depositor's fault (失着).\n2. The money at that time was clearly Mr. Yi Yongik's personal wealth. As evidence (證明), were there any high officials (高官大爵) back then who did not possess vast fortunes (巨財) of hundreds of thousands or millions of yen? Moreover, 400,000 yen then would exceed 4 million yen today. Now, they are merely asking for the principal (原金) and interest (利子) to that extent; is there any reason to refuse?\nHowever, this is a matter for time (時日) to resolve (解決) in the future. We cannot yet say whether it will be recovered or not. (Omission - Original Text)\nWhile we intend to follow the fate (運命) of this money with great interest (興味) in the days to come, in any case, since it's not just 100,000 yen, has a long history and origin (由來), and the characters involved (登場人物) surrounding this huge sum are all major figures, everyone is watching closely, wondering how it will turn out.\n\nAs I prepare to put down my pen, today's telegram from Tokyo (東京電報) reports that Mr. Yi Chongho (李鍾浩) has finally filed a lawsuit (訴訟) against the First Bank (第一銀行) in the Tokyo District Court (東京地方裁判所), seeking compensation (賠償) of 900,000 yen. Moreover, Mr. Yi Chongho is currently in Tokyo. What will become of this ¼ (likely refers to the case/issue) in the future? <21>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis 1930 article recounts the life of Yi Yongik, a powerful figure during the late Chosŏn Dynasty and Korean Empire, focusing on a large sum of money (originally 330,000-400,000 yen, now claimed at 900,000 yen with interest) he deposited in the First Bank before going into exile. The article details Yi's rise from humble origins, his service to Empress Myŏngsŏng (including carrying her to safety during a palace coup), his accumulation of wealth and power (holding multiple high offices), and his eventual exile. It then discusses the efforts of his grandson, Yi Chongho, to recover the deposited funds, culminating in a lawsuit filed against the First Bank in Tokyo. The article presents arguments for and against the recovery of the funds, highlighting the legal complexities and the historical context. From a historical perspective, the article is interesting for its portrayal of a transitional figure like Yi Yongik, navigating the turbulent politics between traditional Chosŏn and encroaching foreign powers (Russia, Japan), the significant role personal wealth and connections played, and the legal battle over assets occurring under Japanese colonial rule, reflecting the complexities faced by Koreans dealing with Japanese institutions over pre-colonial matters.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n李容翊\t이용익\tYi Yongik\n明成皇后\t명성황후\tEmpress Myŏngsŏng\n內藏院卿\t내장원경\tDirector of the Palace Treasury

우리는 일세의 괴걸 리용익이란 인물부터 알어보기로 하자.\n\n그의 幼年時代\n리용익씨는 함경북도 명천(明川)에서 낫다. 백두산이 일사천리로 동해(東海)로 향하여 내닷다가 잠간 안저서 쉰 듯이 평퍼짐하게 생긴 평야(平野)에 가르노힌 곳 잇고 거기 천석(泉石)의 미관(美觀)으로 일홈이 잇는 칠보산(七寶山)이 잇고 그 산을 타고 한 고개만 넘으면

걸걸걸 웃고 안젓다가 노름이 거지 반 끗이 날 때에 팔을 불끈거두고\n「자 바더라!」\n하고는 그 판 안에 열놈이면 열놈 스무놈이면 스무놈을 한거번에 때려눕히고는 그 돈을 쉰량이든지 백량이든지 와락 끌어서 엽전꾸럼이를 허리에 들들 마라감고 나는 새와 가치 남의 짐 담장을 풀풀 뛰어넘어 종적을 감추고 말엇다.\n이졈은 손병희(孫秉熙)씨의 소년시대와 꼭 갓하엿다.\n이래서 그는 명천일읍에서 남 잘치고 노름 잘 노는 놈이란 일홈을 엇엇다.\n그는 열칠팔세 되어 엉뚱한 생각을 가지고 함경남도 갑산금광(甲山金鑛)에 와서 금졈판에 몸을 던지엇다. 그때는 평안도 운산(雲山)과 갑산이 금이 제일 잘 난다든 곳이라 그는 거기서 몃해 잇는 동안에 송아지 만한 금덩이를 손에 쥘 수 잇섯다. 다른 사람갓흐면 그 금괴를 쥐엿스면 밧사고 집 살 것을 생각하엿스리라. 그러나 그는 봇짐에 들들 말어서 억개에 걸머지고 서울대궐을 향하여 천리길을 거러왓다. 그 금덩이를 나라에 바치어 국고(國庫)금으로 쓰자는＜19＞ 것어엇스니 실로 놀라운 생각을 하엿든 것이다.\n님금은 금을 밧으시고 리용익을 불느셧다. 본즉 말에 꾸밈이 업고 긔골이 장대하고 성격이 걸걸하여 가위 국가유용의 재라

거지 반 동양의 여걸이라 일컷든 명성황후의 수중에 잇든 때임으로 대원군은 황후를 내여 쫏고 친히 녯날과 가치 대정을 섭람하려함이엿다.(略-원문)\n불의에 변을 맛난 황후의 신변은 실로 위태하엿다. 만일 촌각이라도 지쳬하신다면 엇더케도 무서운 위험이 닥처올 것인지 몰낫다. 밤은 삼경 천지는 고요하나 대궐안은 물끌 듯 소란하엿다. 왕후를 모시든 비빈들은 그만 엇절 줄을 모르고 발을 등동 구르며 울뿐.\n침전의 낭하에도 슬푸고 놀라서 우는 우름소리가 처량하고 궁녀시녀들의 찻든 금은옥패가 어지럽게 떠러저 마즈막 비참한 날을 당한 듯한 그 때에 엇든 륙척이나 되는 장한이 나는 새와 가치 왕후의 압헤 부복하며 이 위란을 구할 맹세를 하엿다. 그러고는 왕후를 모시고 왕궁의 그 놉흔 담장을 뛰어 빈지 바람인지 흔적 업시 사라젓다.\n\n慘憺한 宮變前后\n그가 리용익인 것은 더 무를 여디 업스리라. 그날 밤 왕후를 모시고 그는 실로 나는 새와 가치 재싼 거름으로 륙조압흘 지나 동대문 박을 나서 동관을 뒤에 두고 광나루로 송파(松坡)로 끗끗내 단숨에 왕후의 고향인 려주읍에까지 이르럿다. 그래서 왕후를 모시어 땅에 내려노차 멀니서 첫닭이 두 홰채 울며 먼동이 훤-히 터 오르더라고 한다. 그 하로 밤사이에 실로 백여리를 거른 것이엿다.\n이러한 비극이라기에는 너무 슬프고 히극(喜劇)이라기에는 무나너 엄속한 궁변(宮變)이 잇슨지 얼마 아니잇서서 세월은 다시 순하게 흐르게 되여 명성후께서는 다시 환궁(還宮)하시엇다. 그때 후께서 리용익의 충성과 사내다운 긔개에 깁히 감동하섯슴은 물론이라 환궁하시자 어느 고을 군수(郡守)를 식히시엇다가 다시 북청부사(北靑府使)를 식히시엇다가 미구에 궁궐에 불느시어 전국 금광의 세감(稅監)을 식히엇다. 그래서 리용익씨는 녯날 금전군으로 도라다니든 갑산금광에도 갓금 가서 송아지가튼 금덩어리를 만히 채굴하여 나라에 바치엇다한다.\n그런 뒤는 순풍에 돗달엇다 할가 세상에 드물게 보는 영달(榮達)을 하기로 되어 일시는 대장원경(內藏院卿)에 군부대신(軍部大臣)에 엇재든 유명한 벼슬 여덜개인지 아홉 개인지를 일신에 지니게 되엇다한다. 그가 군부대신 때에 서울 동대문박게 잇는 삼산평(지금 牧場)터에 만흔 군인을 모아노코 신식 조련을 할 때에 크다란 훈장을 가슴에 차고 군복을 입은 그가 각금 림장하는 것을 본 사람이 지금도 서울 장안에 수두룩이 잇다. 엇재뜬 그 위풍당당한 품에 모든 사람들은 저절로 위압을 밧엇드라 한다.\n그는 걸물이라 자긔의 경룬을 어느 정도까지 휘두드리게 되자 그제는 민간의 지사들과 만히 결탁하여 학교와 개화긔관을 만히 만들기를 게을니지 아니하엇다. 실로 근세 교육의 개척자라 할 리종호씨도 이러한 리해잇는 조부를 가지지 못하엿더면 그 사업에 그러케 거액의 자금을 쓰지 못하엿스리라.\n그러다가 한말의 어지러운 풍운에 그는 몸을 국의에 멀니 피하엿다. 그때 남어지 돈으로는 졔일은행(第一銀行)에 예금하여 둔 34만원의 현금이엇다. 그 돈을 그냥 국내에 떨어두고 간 뜻은 사랑하는 손자 리종호씨의 사업을 도으려 함이엇는지 또는 뒷날 다시 서울 땅을 드듸어 사용할 각오를 하엿슴인지 혹은 뒤에 따르는 거문 손이 너무도 급하매 미처 차저낼 틈이 업섯든 것인지 좌우간＜20＞ 천고의 의문을 남기고 거액 40만원돈 은행의 금고 속 깁히 잠기어지고 말엇다.\n이것이 세상을 놀래이든 90만원 사건의 첫발단이엇다.\n그런데 여기에 또 한 가지 변이 낫다. 명치 42년 즉 술년해의 10월에 이등박문이(할빈)에서 죽엇다. 리종호씨는 그 사변의 혐의자로 잡히어 감옥에 가치엇다. 그러다가 혐이가 풀니어 다시 나왓다. 그때는 대세는 이미 결정적이 되엇다. 이에 리종호씨도 안에 잇지 못할 몸임을 깨달고 중국으로 갓다. 처음 북경(北京)에 갓섯스나 거기 역시 안전치 못함으로 다시 몸을 옴기여 청도(靑島)를 거처 다시 상해(上海)로 갓다. 거기 역시 안전치 못하야 서백리아로 해삼위로 갓다. 몃해잇다가 다시 북경과 상해에 나왓다가 상해에서 일본관헌에게 잡히어 서울로 드러왓다. 와서는 거주제한(居住制限)을 밧고 그의 고향인 명천에 가치어 잇섯다. 이것이 요행 풀니어 다시 서울에 몸을 나타낫슬 때에 생각한 것이 전긔 저금을 찾는 일이엇다. 그래서 그 길로 동경(東京)으로 건너가 각 방면으로 활동하엇다.(중략-원문)\n거기에서 송병준(宋秉畯)을 맛낫다. 송은 녯날 그가 내부대신 때에 이 돈은 먹을려고 책동하여 온갖 음모를 다한 일이 잇섯슴으로 리씨에 대하여는 수화의 사이엇슬 것이다. 그때 송은 「과거는 그 돈에 대하여 내가 불측한 마음을 먹엇스나 다 잘못하엿스니 그때 감정은 물에 씨서 버리고 이제부터는 그 돈을 찾는데 성이를 다하여 주겟노라」\n하고 잘못을 사죄하기까지 하엿더라 한다. 그러나 송병준은 얼마 잇지 안어서 그남아 제 세상으로 가버리고 리종호씨는 결과가 시언치 못하야 도로 동경으로부터 나왓다.\n\n돈은 엇지되나?\n이 돈을 중심삼고 세상에는 여러 가지 관측이 도라단닌다. 그 중에 그 돈은 못찾고 말니라는 편에는\n1. 은행의 규측에 의지하면 여금주(預金主)가 십년 이상? 행방이 불명한 때는 그 돈을 국고에서 몰수하기로 되엇단 말이 잇스니 그러니 규측대로 하면 어려우리라.\n2. 30여만원이란 거액이 그 때 리용익씨의 사재인지 또는 내장원경으로 잇섯슴으로 황실 돈이나 국고금이 아니엇슬가\n하는 점이요. 다른 한편 응당 찻게되리라 한는 측의 말을 드르면\n1. 은행규측에는 그러케 되엇스나 그것은 그동안 사정에 따르는 일이다. 큰 천변 때문에 여금주에게 여금을 차즐 긔회를 주지 안엇슴으로 그러케 된 것인 즉 여금주의 실착이라 불 수 업다.\n2. 그때 돈은 리용익씨의 사재가 분명한 것이다. 그 증거로는 그때의 고관대작치고 수십만원 수백만원의 거재를 가지지 안엇든 사람이 잇섯든가. 더구나 그때도 40만원이 지금 돈으로 헤면 400만원도 넘으리라. 이제 다만 그 원금과 리자를 달나는 그 정도인데 아니 줄까닭이 잇느냐\n함이라. 그러나 이것은 압흐로 시일이 해결할 문제라 아직은 차저지리라고 차저지지 못하리라도 우리는 말할 수 업다.(중략-원문)\n이 뒷날 이 돈의 운명을 만흔 흥미를 가지고 직혀 나가려 하거나와 좌우간 일이 10만원돈도 아니요 또 력사와 유래가 깁고 그 거금을 싸고도는 등장인물(登場人物)도 모다 큰 인물이니만치 엇더케나 되나? 하고 누구나 살피고 잇는 터이다.\n\n붓을 노으려 할 때 오늘의 東京電報는 李鍾浩씨가 마츰내 第一銀行을 상대로 90만원 배상의 소송을 동경지방 재판소에 제기하엿다 한다.

Life\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCh'unwŏn\n\n1. This and That in Shanghai\n\nA Chance Encounter in Andong County\nWith the thought of undertaking a penniless trip around the world, I left Osan School, where I had dedicated four years of the most beautiful period of my life, and went to Andong County (安東縣). The scene of the young students following me for 20 or 30 *li* as I left Osan School, tearfully bidding me farewell, is one of the most significant and unforgettable events of my life.\nAt that time, I was 23 years old, and my heart was filled with surging ambition and a fanciful wanderlust. In those days, many people with aspirations crossed the Yalu River (압록강), singing songs of sorrow as they set out on the path of overseas wandering. Figures like Sin Ch'aeho and Yun Kisŏp all passed through Osan around that time before leaving. While I might say I was swept up in that current, I also had my own unique reasons.\nAfter spending one night in Andong County, I found I had only 70-odd *chŏn* left in my purse. With this, I intended to head towards Fengtian (奉天), go as far as I could, and then continue my journey by begging, passing directly through places like Henan (河南), heading to Nanjing (南京), Shanghai (上海), Hangzhou (杭州), Fujian (福建), Guangdong (廣東), Annam (安南), India (印度), Persia (波斯) – an endless wandering.\nJust as I stepped out of the inn (客主) gate, I unexpectedly met Widang Chŏng Inbo. I had only met him once in Kyŏngsŏng (京城, Seoul) several years prior, and we weren't yet close enough to be called friends. However, admiring Widang's literary fame (文名), I gladly took his hand, which was as delicate and soft as silk trousers (명주고롬).\n\"What brings you here? And where are you headed?\" was his greeting to me.\nStanding there by the roadside, I roughly explained my intentions. Hearing my words, Widang said,\n\"That's nonsense. In this cold weather... Just go to Shanghai. In Shanghai, there's Kain (可人, Hŏng Myŏnghŭi's pen name at the time) and Hoam (湖岩, Mun Ilp'yŏng's pen name). I'm also going back to Shanghai soon after visiting home,\" he strongly urged me.\nAt first, I stubbornly resisted with a few words, but eventually, I accepted Widang's kindness. Widang took out two 10-yuan Chinese banknotes <22> from his own travel funds and gave them to me. Then, right away, he headed to the station bound for Seoul.\nWith the 20 yuan Widang gave me, I bought a boat ticket to Shanghai for 14 yuan, purchased a blue Chinese outfit (淸服), and became a passenger on the British ship named *Yuezhou* (岳州). At that time, I had three companions: one was Chŏng Uyŏng, who has already passed away; another was Ch'a Kwanho; and the third was Min Ch'ungsik. These three seemed to have been traveling together from Seoul, but I met them for the first time at the inn in Andong County. Consequently, the three of them shared a cabin, while I occupied one room alone.\nIt was November. Snow lay white on the Yŏnsan mountains near Yongamp'o (龍岩浦), and ice was forming on the deck. The cold in the unheated cabin was beyond words. The night before departure, I spent the entire night wrapped tightly in a blanket, pacing back and forth within the tiny cabin, not even the size of a single storage chest (간통).\n\nHardship in Yingkou\nThe ship briefly stopped at Dalian (大連) and then arrived at Yingkou (營口). However, for some reason, the *Yuezhou* remained docked in Yingkou, and our group was put ashore in Yingkou city.\nWe checked into a Chinese inn somewhere in the city and waited for the next ship to depart, lingering there for 3 or 4 days, though I don't remember exactly.\nHere, worries arose. My travel money had run out. Out of the initial 20 yuan, the boat ticket was 14 yuan, the Chinese outfit, no matter how cheap, must have been 3 or 4 yuan, and the sampan (쌈판) fare from Andong County to the main ship at Sandalangtou (三大浪頭) was also considerable (不少). I didn't even have 1 yuan left in my purse. If we had sailed directly to Shanghai, I wouldn't have worried as meals were provided on the ship, but having to stay at an inn midway meant I couldn't even afford the lodging fee for one night. At that moment, I truly wanted to die. I had never been in such a predicament, caught between a rock and a hard place (進退維谷).\nThe first person to notice my predicament was Ch'a Kwanho. He comforted me, telling me not to worry about the lodging expenses in Yingkou. However, accepting money from someone else when I had no prospects of funds even upon reaching Shanghai felt shameless, but being compelled by necessity (迫不得已), it was unavoidable (無可奈何). I escaped this difficulty thanks to Ch'a Kwanho's kindness, but I still haven't had the chance to repay his goodwill. The amount I owe Ch'a-kun might be less than 5 yuan, but his generosity (厚誼) cannot possibly be measured in 1,000 or 10,000 yuan. It seemed Chŏng Uyŏng was also traveling with Ch'a-kun's help at that time.\nThere's one more incident that occurred on the ship to Shanghai worth mentioning. Min Ch'ungsik thought my hat was too worn out and donated an American military-style cap to me. Imagining my appearance then – wearing worn-out Western wooden clogs (西洋木), trousers, and a jacket underneath, covered by a blue cotton Chinese outfit (淸服), and topped with this American military cap – still makes me chuckle (失笑). Furthermore, the dye of the Chinese outfit wasn't stable, staining my hands and neck with blue dye (얘청물).\n\nSharing a Bed\nIn Shanghai, I went to house number 22 on Baier Road (白爾部路), I believe, where Hŏng Myŏnghŭi, Mun Ilp'yŏng, <23> and Cho Yongŭn were living together. Although I didn't have a penny, those gentlemen were also broke (강목을 츠는 판), apparently just waiting expectantly for Chŏng Inbo to bring money from Korea. Adding another dependent freeloader (식객) like me must have been a concern. There was no money to buy a simple bed frame (窮寢臺), let alone bedding (衾枕). I slept in the same bed with Hŏng Myŏnghŭi, sharing one blanket. And what a miserable bed it was! A thin straw mat was laid on top of woven coir ropes (棕梠노). When two heavy bottoms lay on it, it sagged deeply like a hammock (햄목). When I woke up during the night, we often found ourselves sleeping with our bottoms pressed together, facing opposite directions.\nI recall that sometimes, when the food ran out, we managed to eat by getting help from Sin Chŏng (pen name Nigwan, 睨觀), who is now deceased.\nAt that time, Nigwan rented a slightly larger house than ours, lodged 7 or 8 students, and also ran an English language school. Sin Ch'aeho and Kim Kyusik also resided at Nigwan's place. In essence, around 1913, Nigwan's house was the headquarters not only for Shanghai but for the Korean exiled patriots (亡命客) throughout the Jiangnan (江南) region. Nigwan was the leader of an association called the Tongjesa (同濟社).\nHowever, poverty follows Koreans wherever they go. The Korean exiles gathered in a corner of the French Concession (法租界) often faced the calamity (厄) of running out of food (絶糧). Instances like suffering from tobacco withdrawal all day long, only to feel the joy of revival (甦生) upon receiving a packet of Zizhuanche brand cigarettes (自轉車票) through the kindness of the Chinese servant who cooked our meals, or Cho Yongŭn being unable to go out except to sunbathe in the French Park (프란스 공원) bareheaded and wearing slippers (슬립바) because he had no hat or shoes, are representative anecdotes of life back then.\n\nCrucian Carp Stew\nI caught the flu. I had a considerable fever. Hŏng Myŏnghŭi, forced to sleep bottom-to-bottom in the same bed with such a patient, was truly pitiful.\nWe were hardly in a position to call a doctor. Sin Ch'ŏl had some medical knowledge and became my attending physician. Later, he bought a crucian carp (붕어) each day for 3 or 4 days, personally stewed it, and gave it to me. The touching emotion of such devoted care (愛護) truly pierced my bones (뼈에 사모쳣다). This is the incident I wrote about in my piece \"To a Young Friend\" (어린 벗에게). \"Why on earth did I have to take that cold bath (冷水浴), causing trouble?\"\nAfter recovering, I was thoroughly teased (嘲弄) by Hŏng Myŏnghŭi. From that time on, I stopped taking cold morning baths. (End of this section) <24>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis memoir by Ch'unwŏn (likely Yi Kwangsu) recounts his impulsive decision in 1912/1913 to leave his teaching post at Osan School for a penniless journey, initially aiming for India via China. Stranded financially in Andong County, he's unexpectedly aided by Chŏng Inbo, who gives him money to reach Shanghai. The journey involves further hardship in Yingkou, where Ch'a Kwanho helps him with lodging costs. In Shanghai, he joins other Korean exiles like Hŏng Myŏnghŭi and Mun Ilp'yŏng, experiencing poverty, shared cramped living conditions, and reliance on figures like Sin Chŏng (Nigwan) and the Tongjesa association. He falls ill and is cared for by friends. Historically, the article offers a valuable firsthand glimpse into the precarious lives of early Korean nationalist exiles in Shanghai, highlighting their financial struggles, mutual support networks (like the Tongjesa), and connections between key figures like Sin Ch'aeho, Kim Kyusik, Hŏng Myŏnghŭi, and Chŏng Inbo in the pre-1919 independence movement era. The descriptions of poverty and reliance on others underscore the difficulties faced by those who chose exile.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n春園\t춘원\tCh'unwŏn\n五山학교\t오산학교\tOsan Hakkyo (Osan School)\n安東縣\t안동현\tAndong Hyŏn (Andong County)\n압록강\t압록강\tAmnokkang (Yalu River)\n申采浩\t신채호\tSin Ch'aeho\n尹琦燮\t윤기섭\tYun Kisŏp\n河南\t하남\tHanam (Henan)\n南京\t남경\tNanjing\n上海\t상해\tShanghai\n杭州\t항주\tHangzhou\n福建\t복건\tPokkŏn (Fujian)\n廣東\t광동\tKwangdong (Guangdong)\n安南\t안남\tAnnam\n印度\t인도\tIndo (India)\n波斯\t파사\tP'asa (Persia)\n鄭寅普\t정인보\tChŏng Inbo\n京城\t경성\tKyŏngsŏng (Old name for Seoul)\n洪命熹\t홍명희\tHŏng Myŏnghŭi\n文一平\t문일평\tMun Ilp'yŏng\n岳州\t악주\tAkchu (Yuezhou -

He also established the social enlightenment institution Posŏnggwan (普成舘), inviting emerging scholars of the time such as Hyŏn Ch'ae (玄采) to publish monthly magazines like *Yare* (夜雷) and *Pŏpchŏng Hakke* (法政學界). On the other hand, he had textbooks such as *Tongguk Saryak* (東國史略) and *Yunyon Simdok* (幼年心讀), used in elementary, middle, and high schools nationwide, compiled, printed, and distributed. Based at the Sŏbuk Hakhoe (西北學會), he was busy with the movement for national development and progress (開國進取運動). Meanwhile, continuing the aspirations and work of his father and grandfather, he unsparingly threw in a huge fortune of hundreds of thousands of won to establish numerous schools in various parts of the peninsula, striving painstakingly to nurture the second generation of citizens.\n\nLooking back from today, the establishment of several educational institutions might not seem so astonishing. However, pioneering this direction in Chosŏn society during the era of 25 or 26 years ago, which was like the Middle Ages, is truly an indelible record in history. Just as countless unnamed small stones lie beneath and support a large, brilliantly colored monument that rises high, the path of any shining society built is paved underneath with the precious blood of nameless pioneers who exhausted their blood and bones. When we think about having even this much culture today, how much painstaking effort (心血) of foresightful predecessors must have been poured beneath it? Teacher Yi Chong-ho was an \"immortal pillar of sacrifice (人柱)\" buried underground for the sake of erecting the monument that is us, and also the nameless weeds and nameless earth and stones themselves.\n\nEven if it is with a pen that cannot discourse freely, recording a part of the work of Teacher Yi Chong-ho, the great benefactor of modern education, will likely not be a meaningless effort in this regard.\n\nTeacher Yi was born 44 years ago from now in Ha-ga-myŏn (下加面), Myŏngch'ŏn-gun (明川郡), Hamgyŏng North Province (咸鏡北道), with the modern-era eccentric Yi Yong-ik (李容翊) as his grandfather and Mr. Yi (李0氏), who later met an unnatural end in Siberia (西伯利亞), as his father. After studying Chinese Classics (漢學) in his youth, he came to Seoul (上京) and associated with Yi Kap (李甲), Yi Tong-hwi (李東輝), and others who would later be sworn allies in the Sŏbuk Hakhoe.\n\nThen, in the winter of the Kyemyo year (癸卯年, 1903), as the situation in East Asia became urgent, Japan and Russia finally started a war centering on the peninsula. In the spring of the following Kapchin year (甲辰年, 1904), his grandfather Yi Yong-ik, who was then the Minister of Finance (度支部大臣), was for some reason suddenly abducted onto a Japanese warship (日軍艦) and taken straight to Tokyo (東京), only returning in the winter of that year after the war ended.\n\nThe result of the war finally awakened the peninsula from its deluded dream. Therefore, people with purpose initiated a call to \"Go among the masses!\" and new ideas of national development and progress began to surge like waves everywhere. Among these, one of the bravest groups of workers was Teacher Yi Chong-ho. Teacher Yi, like others, pledged to devote his life to the country and society and resolved to abandon his wife, children, and vast private fortune in a single morning. At that time, believing that the only way to rectify the declining trend was through the enlightenment of the people's wisdom (民智), he and his comrades focused their main efforts on establishing schools above all else. Finally, in the spring of the Ŭlsa year (乙巳年, 1905), Posŏng College,<25> which taught politics, economics, law, and modern science, was constructed on the site of the Foreign Language School (外國語學校) in Chŏn-dong (磚洞), which is now the affiliated school building of the Normal School in Susong-dong (壽松洞). Subsequently, Posŏng Elementary School was opened at the site of the Seminary (神學校) in Sae-mun-an (새문안) and at Ch'ŏnyŏnjŏng (天然亭) outside Sae-mun-bat (새문밧), striking the first chord for nurturing talented youth. And the following year, Posŏng Middle School was also founded, thus the model of university, middle school, and elementary school can be said to have been completely cast from Teacher Yi's hands.\n\nPrior to this, the outcome of Japan's victory in the Russo-Japanese War decided the fate of Yi Yong-ik, a leading figure of the pro-Russian faction (親露派). He entrusted his affairs to his descendants and acquaintances and abruptly departed for Russia (路西亞).\n\nFrom this point, Teacher Yi Chong-ho, though merely 18 years old, had a tragic resolve in his heart. Lying in a warm place one day, without a moment's rest, he truly traveled far and wide (南船北馬) with his comrades, dedicating all his energy to establishing schools. To count just one or two examples, first, together with Mr. Chŏng An-rip (鄭安立), who is now in North Manchuria (北滿), he went to Ch'ungju (忠州) in Ch'ungch'ŏng Province (忠淸道) and established a Posŏng Middle School there. Then, he went to various places like Kilchu (吉州) and Myŏngch'ŏn (明川) in Hamgyŏng North Province and jointly funded the creation of Posŏng Elementary Schools with local influential figures (有志). Thus, by around the Kyŏngsul year (庚戌年, 1910), the number of middle and elementary schools established by his hand exceeded ten, and his investment amounted to no less than 300,000 to 400,000 wŏn.\n\nWas that all? Even when the tide turned against him and he had to flee abroad for his life, wandering through Beijing (北京), Qingdao (靑島), Shanghai (上海), and Vladivostok (海參威), wherever his footsteps reached, he would find even a few small rooms (數間斗屋) to establish village schools (書堂) and schools before moving on.\n\n2\nSo, what and how did he intend to educate then? What kind of individuals did Teacher Yi and his comrades aim to nurture after building schoolhouses and recruiting students? Did they intend to create gentlemen with developed intellect and virtue like in England (英吉利)? Did they intend to create talented individuals for social interaction like in France (佛蘭西)? No, no. The purpose of their education was just one thing. It was to produce politically useful individuals for that era, that is, politicians. They devoted all their efforts to producing, as quickly as possible, numerous workers who could directly guide the lives of the social masses. Naturally, they emphasized \"history\" education, teaching the traces of rise and fall throughout history to make their blood boil. They also taught military-style drills (兵式操練), including carrying rifles and shooting, almost daily. Given the circumstances of the times, one can sufficiently glimpse the anxious and tense psychology of the educators back then.\n\nThus, in all 13 provinces, motivated individuals (有志者) holding the torch of enlightenment rose up like bees, and every nook and cranny was filled with groups of young students carrying book bags, setting out to learn modern science.\n\nTeacher Yi, who persuaded and encouraged the descendants of stubborn aristocratic families (士大夫), who disliked cropped hair (斷髮) and considered school like an enemy's mansion (怨府), avoiding education, even buying them books, lunch, and shouldering the cost of school supplies himself, must have finally let out a smile of satisfaction (會心) upon seeing this sight.\n\nWhat is particularly noteworthy, as briefly alluded to earlier, is the investment of over 100,000 wŏn to establish Posŏnggwan. Realizing the need to borrow the power of printing and publishing for the dissemination of culture, Teacher Yi deliberately dispatched people<26> to Tokyo to purchase numerous sophisticated machines and typesets. At the same time, he acquired many books from the West (泰西) and materials on the newly rising civilization of Japan at the time. He had newly returned scholars (新進學徒) who had studied in Japan and the West translate them meticulously into our script, printing tens or hundreds of thousands of copies and distributing them free of charge to various schools and youth organizations. Among those who worked extensively centered around Posŏnggwan at that time, Hyŏn Ch'ae (玄采) should be mentioned first; he is the respected father of Mr. Hyŏn Kong-nyŏm (玄公廉). Not only was he a great scholar (碩儒) well-versed in Chinese Classics (漢學), but he was also knowledgeable about Eastern and Western history, so his writings were particularly valued as history textbooks (歷史敎料書) in various schools. Besides him, when students sent by the Korean government (韓國政府派遺) to study in Japan returned, they immediately took up teaching posts, even if only for one or two classes, at Posŏng College, while also engaging in translating books for Posŏnggwan (普書舘). At that time, Teacher Yi was the founder (校主) of the school and the head (舘主) of Posŏnggwan. Separately, T'ae Myŏng-sik (太明軾), who had served as a judge in the courts of the time and was an authority in the legal field, was invited as the chief editor (主幹). The president of Posŏngsa (普成社) was Kim Chu-byŏng (金疇柄), who has now returned to his hometown. And the principal of Posŏng College was Sin Hae-yŏng (申海永), who had been the supervisor of students studying abroad. Thus, the lineup was adorned with numerous talented individuals (濟濟多士).\n\nFrom this point, the sound of pickaxes pioneering new culture resonated with accelerating speed everywhere. If only time had allowed this passion to continue for even five more years, wouldn't everyone have stood upright in the light (光明)? However, the Kyŏngsul year (庚戌年, 1910) arrived suddenly, and Teacher Yi's shadow faded and faded, until finally it could no longer be reflected in these mountains and rivers, and his lonely figure (悄悄한 孤影) disappeared abroad.\n\n3\nAfter that, Teacher Yi continued endless wandering and endless efforts, only to become a body that had lost its freedom again. He returned to his old land, received a one-year residency restriction, stayed in the mountain valleys, and in recent years came up to Seoul, merely gazing blankly at the changed streets here and there, so it is said.\n\nAccording to hearsay, perhaps the pine wind crying on Pugak Mountain (北岳) hurts Teacher Yi's heart, or perhaps the waters of the Han River (漢江) pitifully reflect his shadow; the children in Seoul (京童) say that Teacher Yi hardly goes out these days.\n\nIn any case, seeds sown will sprout; flowers watered will surely bloom. Teacher Yi dedicated his life to education; for his pioneering spirit and passion, we can only hold respect. <27>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis article by Kim Tong-hwan is a retrospective tribute to Yi Chong-ho, hailed as a pioneer of modern Korean education in the early 20th century. It details Yi's founding of the Posŏng school system (elementary, middle, college) and the Posŏnggwan publishing house around 1905, funded by his family's wealth. Motivated by the national crisis following the Russo-Japanese War, Yi aimed to cultivate politically aware and capable citizens through modern education, emphasizing history and even military drills. He collaborated with prominent intellectuals like Hyŏn Ch'ae. However, his ambitious projects were cut short by the Japanese annexation in 1910 (Kyŏngsul Year), forcing him into exile and later a restricted life upon return.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, the article is valuable for documenting the indigenous efforts to establish modern educational institutions in Korea before formal annexation, driven by patriotic fervor and a desire for national strengthening. It highlights the specific focus on practical, nation-building education (politics, history, modern science, physical training) as a response to perceived national weakness and external threats. Yi's personal sacrifice, the collaborative nature of these early educational movements involving intellectuals returning from abroad, and the abrupt curtailment of these efforts by Japanese colonization are points of significant interest to historians studying the late Chosŏn/early colonial period.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n李鍾浩先生\t이종호 선생\tYi Chong-ho Sŏnsaeng\n金東煥\t김동환\tKim Tong-hwan\n普成專門\t보성전문\tPosŏng Chŏnmun\n普成中學\t보성중학\tPosŏng Chunghak\n普成小學\t보성소학\tPosŏng Sohak\n普成舘\t보성관\tPosŏnggwan\n玄采\t현채\tHyŏn Ch'ae\n夜雷\t야뢰\tYare (Magazine Title)\n法政學界\t법정학계\tPŏpchŏng Hakke (Magazine Title)\n東國史略\t동국사략\tTongguk Saryak (Textbook Title)\n幼年心讀\t유년심독\tYunyon Simdok (Textbook Title)\n西北學會\t서북학회\tSŏbuk Hakhoe\n咸鏡北道\t함경북도\tHamgyŏng Pukto\n明川郡\t명천군\tMyŏngch'ŏn-gun\n下加面\t하가면\tHa-ga-myŏn\n李容翊\t이용익\tYi Yong-ik\n西伯利亞\t서백리아\tSŏbaekria (Siberia)\n李0氏\t이모씨\tMr. Yi\n李甲\t이갑\tYi Kap\n李東輝\t이동휘\tYi Tong-hwi\n癸卯年\t계묘년\tKyemyo year (1903)\n東洋\t동양\tTongyang (East Asia/Orient)\n日俄\t일아\tIl-A (Japan-Russia)\n甲辰年\t갑진년\tKapchin year (1904)\n度支部大臣\t탁지부대신\tT'akchibu Taesin (Minister of Finance)\n日軍艦\t일군함\tIl Kunkam (Japanese Warship)\n東京\t동경\tTongyang (Tokyo - Note: Korean reading used, refers to Tokyo)\n乙巳年\t을사년\tŬlsa year (1905)\n壽松洞\t수송동\tSusong-dong\n師範學校\t사범학교\tSabŏm Hakkyo (Normal School)\n磚洞\t전동\tChŏn-dong\n外國語學校\t외국어학교\tOegugŏ Hakkyo (Foreign Language School)\n새문안\t새문안\tSae-mun-an\n神學校\t신학교\tSinhakkyo (Seminary/Theological School)\n새문밧\t새문밧\tSae-mun-bat\n天然亭\t천연정\tCh'ŏnyŏnjŏng\n親露派\t친로파\tCh'illo-p'a (Pro-Russian Faction)\n路西亞\t로서아\tNosia (Russia)\n鄭安立\t정안립\tChŏng An-rip\n北滿\t북만\tPukman (North Manchuria)\n忠淸道\t충청도\tCh'ungch'ŏng-do\n忠州\t충주\tCh'ungju\n咸北\t함북\tHambuk (Hamgyŏng North Province)\n吉州\t길주\tKilchu\n明川\t명천\tMyŏngch'ŏn\n庚戌年\t경술년\tKyŏngsul year (1910)\n北京\t북경\tPukkyŏng (Beijing)\n靑島\t청도\tCh'ŏngdo (Qingdao)\n上海\t상해\tSanghae (Shanghai)\n海參威\t해삼위\tHaesamwi (Vladivostok)\n英吉利\t영길리\tYŏnggilli (England)\n佛蘭西\t불란서\tPullansŏ (France)\n泰西\t태서\tT'aesŏ (The West/Occident)\n玄公廉\t현공렴\tHyŏn Kong-nyŏm\n韓國政府派遺\t한국정부파견\tHan'guk Chŏngbu P'agyŏn (Dispatched by the Korean Government)\n普成普專門\t보성보전문\tPosŏng Po Chŏnmun (Likely typo for 普成專門 Posŏng Chŏnmun)\n普書舘\t보서관\tPosŏgwan (Likely typo for 普成舘 Posŏnggwan)\n太明軾\t태명식\tT'ae Myŏng-sik\n普成社\t보성사\tPosŏngsa\n金疇柄\t김주병\tKim Chu-byŏng\n申海永\t신해영\tSin Hae-yŏng\n北岳\t북악\tPugak (Mountain)\n漢江\t한강\tHan-gang (Han River)\n漢水\t한수\tHansu (Han River water)\n京童\t경동\tKyŏngdong (Children of Seoul/Capital)\n\n**Glossary**\n\n근대적\t근대적\tModern\n창설하엿든\t창설하였던\t(He) who founded (Older past descriptive form)\n사회교화기관\t사회 교화 기관\tSocial enlightenment institution\n영하야\t영하여\tInviting (Older connective form)\n간행케\t간행케\tTo have published (Older causative form)\n밋\t및\tAnd / As well as (Older spelling)\n앗김업시\t아낌없이\tUnsparingly, generously (Older spelling)\n업시\t없이\tWithout (Older spelling)\n반도\t반도\tPeninsula (Referring to Korea)\n數多한\t수다한\tNumerous (Older form)\n第二世 國民養成\t제2세 국민 양성\tNurturing the second generation citizens\n刻苦奮鬪하든\t각고분투하던\t(He) who strove painstakingly (Older past descriptive form)\n안저\t앉아\tSitting (Older spelling)\n그러틋\t그렇게\tLike that, so (Older spelling)\n업지만은\t없지마는\tAlthough there isn't (Older spelling)\n中古\t중고\tMiddle Ages\n개척하엿다함은\t개척하였다 함은\tTo say that (he) pioneered (Older nominalizing construction)\n아니되잘 수 업다\t아니 될 수 없다\tCannot but be, must be (Older spelling/form)\n혼히\t흔히\tCommonly, often (Older spelling)\n밋바닥에는\t밑바닥에는\tAt the very bottom (Older spelling)\n짜작돌들\t자작돌들\tSmall stones, pebbles (Possibly dialectal or older term for 자갈돌)\n떠바치고\t떠받치고\tSupporting from below\n자최\t자취\tTrace, footprint (Older spelling)\n픠\t피\tBlood (Older spelling)\n귀여운\t귀한\tPrecious, valuable (Older usage, now means 'cute')\n만혼\t많은\tMany (Older spelling)\n선지자\t선지자\tForerunner, pioneer (Lit.

李0氏를 父로 이 세상에 출생하엿다. 幼時 漢學을 修하다가 上京하여 後日 西北學會의 盟友이든 李甲, 李東輝씨 등과 交遊하엿다.\n그러다가 癸卯年 겨을에 東洋風雲이 급하야 끗끗내 日俄가 반도를 중심삼고 전란을 起하게되매 그 翌年인 甲辰年 봄에 당시 度支部大臣이든 조부 李容翊씨는 무삼 까닭인지 돌연히 日軍艦에 拉致되어 그 길로 東京으로 가버리고 잇다가 전쟁이 終熄한 그해 겨을에야 귀국하엿다.\n전쟁의 결과는 비로소 반도의 迷夢을 깨우치게 하엿다. 그래서 뜻잇는 인사들은 「민중속으로 가자!」는 부르지즘을 發하게 되어 各處에 開國進取의 신사상이 물결치듯 돌기 비롯하엿다. 이 가운데서 가장 용감한 일군중의 한사람이 李種浩선생이라. 선생은 남들과 가치 一身을 국가사회에 바치기로 맹세하고 妻子와 巨萬의 私財를 一朝에 버리기로 결심하엿다. 그때 기우려지는 대세를 바로 잡을 길이란 오직 民智의 계발에 잇다하야 무엇보다 학교창설에 주력을 너흔 이가 선생과 밋 그의 동지들이다. 마츰내 乙巳年 봄에는 정치경제와 법률과 근대 과학을 전수케 하는 普成專門學校가＜25＞ 지금은 壽松洞 師範學校附屬校舍가 된 당시 磚洞의 外國語學校基地에 건설이 되엿고 계속하여 普成小學이 새문안 神學校

U Pong-un\n\nThe Last Moments of Ch'ae Kŭrigo-ri Sŏnsaeng - Passing Away in a Cold Severance Hospital Room\nChŏng Chong-myŏng\n\n\"I Want to See the Mountains and Rivers\"\n\nHearing the noon bell, I hurried with busy steps and anxiously sought out Room 5 at Severance Hospital outside Namdaemun. There, Comrade Ch'ae Kŭrigo-ri Sŏnsaeng, who had been released from Sŏdaemun Prison just a few days prior after serving a long sentence of three years, lay quietly on the bed, breathing with difficulty. That was April 19, 1930. Sŏnsaeng, who had set foot on Korean soil after a long time on March 29th, stayed at the Namsan Hotel (南山旅館) for several days after leaving prison before being admitted to this tuberculosis ward a short while ago at the recommendation of several comrades. When I entered, his once massive frame had lost all its fat; on top of his emaciated body, he was said to have third-stage tuberculosis, and his breathing appeared quite labored. That day, his pulse was said to have hit 130 to 140 beats per minute, and his body temperature fluctuated around 40 degrees Celsius, indicating he was already in a considerably grave condition. Sŏnsaeng looked at me blankly and asked,\n\"Comrade! Where is this place?\"\n\"It's the hospital, sir. Severance Hospital.\"\n\"No. To me, it feels just like prison. Please let me go outside for a bit. I want to tread upon that ground out there. I want to walk freely around Namdaemun and Chongno, swinging my arms.\"\n\"You certainly will, once you've recovered,\"\nI replied, yet realizing that merely wanting to step on the ground was Sŏnsaeng's wish, an indescribable sorrow caused even my comforting voice to falter. Indeed, Sŏnsaeng never got to step on that ground. From leaving Moscow <28> until passing through Peking, he might have been a bird of freedom, perching on any branch he desired and drinking from any stream he wished, but the moment he set foot on Korean soil, starting from Sinŭiju, his mind and body became separated entities. If one were to say he forcibly stepped on the soil of his old homeland after several decades, perhaps it was the dusty ground upon the Yalu River Railway Bridge (鴨綠江鐵橋). Sŏnsaeng gazed longingly – truly longingly – at the sunlight falling and burning on the early spring grass outside the windowpane, then spoke again,\n\"Comrade! Look at that. Look at those lush grasses and trees. Grass grows on the ground, trees are there, and streams flow too. I want to walk through those wide fields, that wide land.\"\nAfter another pause,\n\"Outside is good! I really can't stand being here. This bed, these barred windows, this empty room, this hospital where I can't hear people's voices. Comrade, how is this different from prison? If you care for me, please let me lie down in a Korean house. I want to be in a Korean house – even an inn would be fine – where I can eat kkakdugi (깍둑이) and chew on bean sprouts. I want to press my back against the warm lower part of an ondol floor. I want to chat with comrades morning and evening. I miss the mountains and rivers, but I also miss my comrades, our food, and our clothes.\"\nThen, as if frustrated, he thumped his chest with both fists. His facial muscles tensed up here and there, and his breathing quickened, appearing greatly agitated. Then he spoke of his dreams. He dreamt he was still confined in prison, feeling anxious and immensely troubled, only to wake with a start and find the same barred window, the cold bed, the lonely solitary cell – he thought it was still prison. I comforted him, saying that a materialist (唯物論者) – a believer in the materialist conception of history (唯物史觀) – shouldn't harbor such weak thoughts, that it was all due to atmospheric pressure (氣壓關係). Feeling that my presence beside him might be intensifying his sentimental mood, I finally asked,\n\"Is there anything you'd like to eat or drink?\"\n\"Please give me something cool.\"\nI bought a bottle of cider and gave it to him. Sŏnsaeng drank it all in one gulp. Honestly, I wished I could have brought him some mineral water from that oppressed valley, which has such strong ties to prisons, but when would there be time for that? Then Sŏnsaeng again stared blankly – watching the sunlight and the royal azaleas blooming in the courtyard. Promising to return, I left the room, and turning down the corridor, I buried my face in my skirt hem and wept for a long time, unable to suppress the tears that flowed unknowingly, uncontrollably... –\n\nI had not known Ch'ae Kŭrigo-ri Sŏnsaeng personally. When he arrived at Namdaemun Station three years ago, bound in ropes on his way to Sŏdaemun Prison after being arrested in Sinŭiju, I only exchanged silent nods with other comrades from afar. During his three years of imprisonment, I only visited him three or four times for interviews to offer comfort. However, thinking of the weary Sŏnsaeng, whose parents, wife, and children were in Siberia, I felt comradely affection. With the thought that if I could be of any help, I wouldn't spare any effort for his well-being, I had visited him several times since his hospitalization, but never before had I shed tears out of such genuine pity and sorrow as I did today.\n\nAlas, This Person Has Departed\nThat evening at seven o'clock, an urgent call came from the hospital to Mr. Pak Ch'an-hŭi (朴讚熙) of the Tong-A Ilbo (東亞日報). With a pounding heart, I rushed to the hospital with four comrades: U Pong-un (禹鳳雲), Pak Ch'an-hŭi, Song Pong-u (宋奉瑀), and Pak Ho-jin (朴昊辰). How could we have known? His eyes were already glazed over, and an unseen dark cloud was ominously swirling around his face. Even when we sat beside him, it took a long while <29> for him to recognize who we were, and his speech was barely coherent. The room echoed with his groans. Only his loud voice, like an alto in vocal music, occasionally broke the quiet stillness of extinction, and realizing that his life was gradually departing from this earth, I suppressed the tears welling in my eyes and, unable to bring myself to utter the word \"will,\" asked,\n\"Is there anything you wish to say?\"\nHe opened his mouth several times as if to say something, but perhaps his strength failed him, and he fell silent again. Several of us, joining our voices together once more, asked,\n\"Is there anything you wish to say?\"\n\"Cool water! Cool water!\"\nhe pleaded, so I bought another bottle of cider and offered it to him. Only then did he say,\n\"I definitely have something to say, yes I do, I really do... Dear comrades! Please come back again tomorrow evening at this time.\"\nHe still believed his life would continue. Even if he couldn't guarantee living for another 10 or 20 years, he believed he would live for another year or two, or at least a day or two more. His pulse was weak, his skin was cooling, his eyes were difficult to keep open, white foam appeared at his mouth, and from his throat came the rattling sound often heard at the moment of death, yet ah – Sŏnsaeng believed he would live a few more days and planned to meet us again. On the doctor's instruction that staying too long would be detrimental to the patient, we reluctantly left the hospital room again. It was 10:30 PM. Carrying heavy hearts filled with sorrow, pity, and frustration, we returned home, only to have someone rush over from the hospital immediately after.\n\"Sŏnsaeng Ch'ae has passed away!\"\nWhat? How can I describe this sorrowful heart? That night, we comrades wept around the body. We wept and wept, and wept again. In the room where just moments before a breathing person had been, now only a cold corpse like stone remained. Was not the only freedom permitted to us to weep?\n\nBrain as a Specimen\nAfterward, honoring his wishes during his lifetime, his remains were entrusted to Severance Hospital for autopsy (解剖), with the intention of benefiting Korea's newly emerging students. It was decided that his skeleton (骨격) and brain (腦醬) would be preserved permanently at the hospital.\nThe funeral ceremony (永訣式) was held on a rainy April 24th, when spring rain soaked the mountains and rivers, at the Ch'ŏndogyo Memorial Hall (天道敎기념관). It goes without saying that condolence songs (吊歌) and condolence messages (輓狀) from various organizations were confiscated that day.\nThus, Sŏnsaeng Ch'ae departed forever. I hear his surviving orphans (遺孤) are in Siberia (西伯利亞), but despite several telegrams and letters, there has been no news. Do they even know of this loss? Sŏnsaeng's brief biography has been introduced numerous times, so I will not write it again here, but it is said that he went to Russia in his youth, believed in the Greek Orthodox Church (希臘敎), attended seminary (神學校), and emerged as a fighter (鬪士) in the communist movement (共産運動) starting in 1917.\nAs I try to put down my pen, a single cloud appears in the sky. Could that be Sŏnsaeng's spirit?\n\nAlas, the Last Moments of Sŏnsaeng Namgang\nChang Chi-yŏng\n\nSŏnsaeng Namgang Yi Sŭng-hun has also passed away! The teacher (先生) who cried out and shed tears for us is gone! The teacher who dried his blood and ground his bones to awaken this people, this society, and open the way forward is gone!\nAlas. Did this land, growing barren, not have the fortune to keep such a worker? Did that indifferent heaven take our teacher away without any regard for our heart-wrenching affection? Though the teacher himself would surely have found it hard to turn his back and leave this land, how could he depart so completely, shaking everything off? <30>\nSŏnsaeng was born 67 years ago in Chŏngju-ŭp, P'yŏnganbuk-to, into a humble family (한미한 가정). Right after entering the world, he lost the mother who should have loved him, growing up without even knowing the taste of mother's milk that everyone else enjoys. When he was ten, his father also passed away. Lonely and desolate, he wandered until he rolled into the marketplace of Chŏngju called Ch'ŏngjŏng, becoming an errand boy at a brassware shop (유긔전). With his innate sincerity and passion, he earned the trust of others and eventually came to manage his own brassware business. For several decades thereafter, until he turned 40, Sŏnsaeng dedicated himself entirely to commerce, and the credit he received in the business world, from Ŭiju in the north to P'yŏngyang in the south, was truly high. He also accumulated considerable wealth. From this point, Sŏnsaeng built a large tiled house in the small village of Yongdong in Osan-myŏn (五山面), Chŏngju, thinking he would spend his remaining years comfortably there, teaching his descendants. However, the times did not grant him such happiness. Following the Sino-Japanese War (일청전쟁) in the Kabo year (1894) came the Russo-Japanese War (일아전쟁) in the Kabjin year (1904), and then... (ellipsis in original)\nAt this time, the Kwansŏ region, which first encountered Sŏnsaeng, rubbed its joyful eyes, awakened from a deep slumber, and regained new spirit. From everywhere, voices crying \"We must know! We must learn!\" rose higher, and villages competed to establish schools.\nWhen Sŏnsaeng was 44, while on a business trip to P'yŏngyang, some opportunity struck his mind, and Sŏnsaeng, possessing a naturally noble character, felt an irresistible surge of emotion. He realized his duty was not accumulating wealth or supporting his family. Right then and there, he cut his hair, hired teachers, bought equipment suitable for establishing a school, and returned to Yongdong. From this point, the waves and twists of Sŏnsaeng's half-lifetime began to unfold. Initially, he devoted all his energy to educating the youth, <31> founding Osan School (五山學校) to nurture young people, and organizing village associations (洞會) to develop rural communities, pouring all his sincerity and wealth into these efforts. However, after several years, for the sake of Korea's history and the future of the masses, he ran east, west, south, and north, pouring out his heart's blood, shouting and working actively. In the midst of this, he was exiled to Cheju (濟州) for plotting something in Manchuria, and then served six years in prison for some conspiracy. Not many days after regaining his freedom, he faced three years behind bars again due to some declaration in the Kimi year (1919). Despite enduring such a bitter and harsh life, Sŏnsaeng's spirit remained unbroken; the more trials he faced, the stronger and sharper he became. Even during the two years after returning home, Sŏnsaeng's seat was never warm. To rebuild the Osan School, which had burned down leaving only the foundation, a cultural village of over 60 households now clustered densely within the wings of the Osan School, which stood tall as if reaching the sky in what was once a small, remote village. There was a hospital, shops, a public bath, and a barbershop – he had truly constructed the Osan Kingdom (오산왕국). All of this was solely the crystallization of Sŏnsaeng's drops of blood and pieces of flesh.\n\nAlas. Sŏnsaeng finally cast all this aside and departed! From now on, Sŏnsaeng's body will be eternally at peace. However, the spirit of Sŏnsaeng, leaving this land behind, must surely be sorrowful.\n\nOn the morning of the eighth day of the fifth month in the Kyŏngo year (May 8, 1930), during the morning assembly at Osan School, Sŏnsaeng ascended the platform as usual. Seeing that the students were not properly observing his teachings, Sŏnsaeng's heart was greatly pained and saddened.\n\"You must not continue to disregard my words like this. Until you correct yourselves, I will not speak to you again.\"\n\nThis was Sŏnsaeng's final admonition to the students of Osan School. Sŏnsaeng's spirit, departing without seeing the students' correction, must be regretful, and the sorrow of the students, who bid farewell to Sŏnsaeng without being able to show him the correction that would satisfy his heart, must have etched boundless grief into their bones. That day, unlike other days, he toured every corner of the school and carefully inspected the teachers' residences lined up across the way. Returning home late in the evening, he immediately gathered the village association called the Self-Exertion Society (自勉會) and discussed farming matters, emphasizing not missing the right season and deliberating on cooperative cultivation. This association originally managed its own fields, which the members farmed collectively, storing the harvest to distribute to members during the difficult summer lean season. At this time, Sŏnsaeng began to feel short of breath and phlegm started rising in his throat. Nevertheless, after finishing the association meeting, he subsequently gathered the Yi Clan Association (李氏門禊) and urged them to manage the clan assets well and strive to enjoy future blessings. By this time, Sŏnsaeng was suffering greatly as phlegm rose, but he still said everything he needed to say. He went to bed around 11 o'clock. His wife, who had stayed awake late, was just drifting off to sleep when Sŏnsaeng shook her awake, saying he had something urgent to say and asking her to fetch those living nearby. His wife arose anxiously, first waking Mr. Pak Ki-sŏn (朴基璿), whose house was closest and who also had deep ties to Osan School, then waking several others. By the time they rushed over, Sŏnsaeng's appearance had already changed drastically. However, his consciousness remained clear. First, opening his eyes and recognizing Mr. Pak Ki-sŏn, Sŏnsaeng said,\n\"Please keep my bones at the school as a specimen. Let them be used for the education of our people.\"\nWaving his hand again, he added,\n\"Other than this, I have nothing more to say.\"\nWith that, he lost consciousness. This was Sŏnsaeng's final instruction (遺言). The time was 2:10 AM on May 9th of the Kyŏngo year. Those who heard it were Pak Ki-sŏn, Pak Kŏn-ch'ae (朴健采), Sŏnsaeng's wife, Mrs. Chang (張氏), and Sŏnsaeng's eldest son, Yi Cha-gyŏng (李子卿) – four people in total. By 4:00 AM, even his faint breathing had ceased.\n\nAlas. Sŏnsaeng is completely gone! His heart, sincerity, wealth, blood, and flesh had already been devoted entirely to youth education and national guidance, leaving only a frame of bones. Yet, Sŏnsaeng felt truly sorry to let even these rot peacefully in the ground. Thus, he dedicated even them to the education of the nation. We, the white-clad folk (힌옷 입은 무리), mourning Sŏnsaeng's wish and feeling grateful, carefully received Sŏnsaeng's body and escorted it to the Anatomy Department (해부학분실) of Kyŏngsŏng University. I too followed, stood before the dissection table in the anatomy lab, shed tears, bowed deeply, and paid my final respects. According to what I hear today, Sŏnsaeng's body has already had all its flesh removed on the dissection table. <32>\n\nThe Last Moments of Sŏnsaeng Yi Sang-jae - The Final Request Left as a Will -\nYi Chong-nin\n\nA Giant of Modern Times\nAlas, our Sŏnsaeng Wŏllam. Are you truly departing on the eternal path now? If this is indeed true, how can you bear to leave on this path? For Sŏnsaeng, who fulfilled his responsibilities for the state (國家) and the people (民衆) as his duty, yet had no rights despite his public service and fulfillment of obligations, this path might seem like a choice (志願). However, for us, your descendants (後人), wandering in a vast wilderness where harsh winds and torrential rains assail from all four directions, it is truly an unbearable path (不忍하신 길). (ellipsis in original)\nAlas, our Sŏnsaeng Wŏllam. If your noble spirit were to look down upon our current state, even you, an eternal optimist (樂天家), could not help but feel sorrow, and even you, a veteran general of a hundred battles (百戰老將軍), could not help but feel deep regret (痛恨).\nBut shall we merely grieve for Sŏnsaeng?\nAlas, our Sŏnsaeng Wŏllam. May you rest in peace (暝目하소서). We who send Sŏnsaeng off today, however junior we may be, will follow Sŏnsaeng's example (郊則하야), fulfill our respective responsibilities and duties, and who does not know that today's sorrow and anguish (痛切) will become the outcry of joy (歡呼聲) of another day? Then, Sŏnsaeng, depart on this path. Alas, our Sŏnsaeng Wŏllam!\n\nThis was the eulogy (哀辭) I recited at Sŏnsaeng Yi Sang-jae's funeral ceremony, soaking my clothes with tears after he passed away. Though anyone's passing is sad, the death of Sŏnsaeng Wŏllam, our model (師表), was indeed an exceedingly sorrowful fact. Reflecting on the hardships (崎嶇) of his life and the utter poverty (赤貧) after his death, who did not shed secret tears (暗淚)? When he quietly closed his eyes, leaving behind a world full of regrets (恨), all Koreans without exception sighed deeply (長歎) and admired his virtue. There was no distinction of old or young, nor of acquaintance or stranger – Sŏnsaeng was truly a giant (巨人). What use is there now in recounting the details of his activities during his lifetime or his teachings (遺訓)? I shall only record the scene of his passing.\n\nA Single Phrase Left Behind\nHearing the startling news (飛報) that he had fallen gravely ill beyond recovery (不起의 重患) and was enveloped in medicine (藥石), I visited Sŏnsaeng's house in Chedong (齊洞) several times. Then, on the morning of March 28th in the Chŏngmyo year (1927), the day before his long journey (長遊 - euphemism for death), while praying wholeheartedly for Sŏnsaeng's recovery, I reached his residence's sarangchae (舍廊 - outer quarters) and sought his sickroom. Had the shadow of death already passed over those once sparkling eyes (烔烔하든 眼光)? The vitality (生彩) of old was gone, and his hands, emaciated as they could be, showed not a trace of fat. He was already at the advanced age (高齡) of 78. While he might not have had much attachment (愛着) to his years, thinking of his brethren and his work (事業), how great must have been his desire to remain longer on this Earth? Sŏnsaeng's gaze and facial expression seemed to say, \"I want to live longer. I want to live <33> longer and do more work,\" so I couldn't even bring myself to ask about his chances of recovery (快効의 有無). As I sat woodenly in a corner of the room, Sŏnsaeng looked at me for a while, then gestured with his eyes for me to come closer. I shuffled nearer on my knees, and then he lifted his arm and took my hand. What remains unforgettable even now is the way he lifted his arm. Since the illness (病魔) had already robbed him of all vitality (元氣), blood, and muscle, what would be as light as a goose feather (鴻毛) for an ordinary person seemed to have the weight of nine tripods (九鼎) for Sŏnsaeng. Mustering all his strength, he barely managed to grasp my hand and said,\n\"I am going. Do much work.\"\nJust that one phrase. Unable to respond, I held his wrinkled hand, and Sŏnsaeng tried to say something more, but perhaps the phlegm rattling in his throat wouldn't clear smoothly; he frowned, agonized, and fell silent. I quickly adjusted his pillow to support <34> his head's position, and he seemed a little more comfortable, drifting off into a drowsy sleep (昏昏히 잠이 드러 버리섯다). Realizing that staying longer might be detrimental to the patient, I turned my heavy steps towards the gate, resolving to return the next day.\nHow could I have known? That the next day, amidst the gently falling spring rain (春雨가 霏霏한 속에서), Sŏnsaeng would depart forever. And how could I have guessed that the words,\n\"I am going. Do good work,\"\nwould be his final words (유언) left to this world, his very last utterance (最後의 一言) whose sound (聲唳) I would never hear again?\nAccording to what I heard, besides his several descendants (子孫), not a single public figure was present at Sŏnsaeng's deathbed (臨終). Furthermore, because his life ended so suddenly, he couldn't even leave a proper will for his children and grandchildren. Thus, that single phrase he imparted to me with such profound meaning was indeed his last, never to be heard again.\n\nA Heartbreaking Funeral\nSŏnsaeng's funeral (葬儀) was conducted as a public funeral (社會葬). Amidst the mourning (哀悼) of hundreds of thousands of people from over 100 organizations, including social groups (사상단체), religious groups (종교단체), youth groups (청년단체), and newspaper and magazine companies (신문잡지사), his body (遺體) departed from Kyŏngsŏng Station (京城驛) on April 7th and was laid to rest peacefully in the mountains and rivers of Hansan (韓山). As the scene at that time is likely still vivid in people's memories, I will omit the details. Let me conclude by recording the lament (輓詞) Sŏnsaeng composed for Emperor Kojong (高宗).\n\nLament for Emperor Kojong (高宗輓詞)\nWailing and again wailing,\nHow can I bear to see this time?\nMountains and rivers retain their old forms,\nGrasses and trees too hold sorrow.\nThe immortal carriage has gone far to the cloudy realm,\nEndless, alas, are the thoughts.\nThe whole sea is turbulent,\nHeaven and earth suddenly tilt askew.\nBeloved and supported for four reigns,\nHis bounty soaked deep into the skin.\nHow can the blue heavens be limitless?\nMyriad affairs shift like mulberry fields turning into seas.\nRemote mountains and distant frontiers,\nThe young and old shed tears of blood.\nThe dragon bier follows ancient rites,\nThe funeral divination follows bequeathed instructions.\nGolden Valley, distant and blue,\nThe gate's sun lingers slow.\nBearing a thousand years of regret,\nI dare present this one piece of verse.\n\nFemale Activist Pak Wŏn-hŭi - Recalling Her Final Sickbed -\nU Pong-un\n\nThirty-Two as One Cycle\nDecember 4, 1927! This day, when fist-sized snowflakes fell softly from the grey sky in early winter, was an infinitely sad and sorrowful day for us. It was the day our comrade (동지) Pak Wŏn-hŭi Yŏsa (朴元熙 女史), who had devoted all her bones and blood for our movement, departed from this world. Although she had lost her husband (夫君) Kim Sa-guk (金思國) a year earlier and might have felt solitude (孤寂) in the world of heterosexual love (異性愛), she had never stopped her determined steps (行進) forward, sustained by her firm belief (信念) in the movement and the love of her comrades, thereby strengthening even our hearts. However, a winter cold (겨울감긔) she caught by chance around the middle of the eleventh lunar month worsened, adding to her chronic weakness (年來의 쇠약), and her illness (病勢) became quite severe. On that day, she finally closed her eyes forever, leaving behind comrades, her work (사업), and a young daughter unable to even walk, eternally, eternally.\nOn the day she passed away, Hwang Sin-dŏk (黃信德), Kang Agŭnnia (姜아근니아), her daughter, relatives, and I kept watch over her final sickbed, surrounded by medicine bottles (藥甁) and sounds of moaning, desperately hoping (苦待) she would regain consciousness (蘇復). How could she die? We didn't know <35> how to despair (落望) like that. How could she, who was so passionate (열렬) and never knew retreat (退却) once she took hold of anything, possibly die from a mere cold? Even though the sun had set, she couldn't form words, phlegm rattled (가래가 가랑가랑 끌고) in her throat, and she couldn't swallow even a spoonful of gruel (미음), surely she wouldn't pass away? Even though her lifeless grey eyes stared blankly at the ceiling (天井), and she lifted her arms, weakened like spiderwebs, groping around as if wanting to embrace something for the last time, surely she wasn't clinging to this world (現世) facing death? She wouldn't die. How could someone indispensable die? Her age was still young, her spirit (기개) like an eagle in the vast blue sky spanning ninety thousand li – surely she wouldn't abandon everyone's hopes and die? Thus we believed, prayed, and suffered alone.\n\"Hey! Pull yourself together!\"\nIf we said this, she would look at the window, turn her eyes to our faces, gaze blankly, and move her lips slightly. Surely it was an attempt to smile, to comfort us in return. Hwang and Kang, seemingly unable to bear it any longer, already had their heads bowed. It must have been a pitiful effort (애처러운 로력) to hide their falling tears from the patient (病人). I quietly took her daughter Sa-ŭn (思恩) and placed her beside her mother. She barely managed to lift her arm, gently stroked the little child's face once, tried to stroke it again, but perhaps lacking the strength, dropped her hand and closed her eyes.\n\"Hey! Pull yourself together. Quickly!\"\n\"....\"\n\"Comrade, comrade! Sa-ŭn is here!\"\n\"....\"\n\"Hey, hey....\"\nAfter a long pause, she opened those lifeless, dead-fish-like grey eyes, looked at her daughter, then her relatives (親戚), then Hwang, then Kang, and finally gazed at my face for a long moment before saying,\n\"Carry on the work well!\"\nLeaving behind just that one phrase, a sound like tiny bones breaking somewhere in a distant world was heard, crack, and her limbs (사지) began to go limp, while foam (거품) started forming at her mouth.\n\"Then, then....\"\nLeaving us behind, shocked and crying out in frenzy (광란), that became her last moment in this world, and she went to the eternal place. As if seeing, yet not seeing, the relatives weeping while holding the body, and the bewildered young daughter–\n\nComrades' All-Night Vigil\nHearing the news of her death (訃音), Pak Hyŏng-byŏng (朴衡秉), Yi Pyŏng-ŭi (李丙儀), Im Pong-sun (任鳳淳), Song Nae-ho (宋乃浩), Yi Hang-bal (李恒發), Im Yun-jae (任允宰), and several others rushed over. Upon arriving, faced with such a pitiful end, they could only bow their heads.\nThat night, we held an all-night vigil (徹夜) beside the body. Recalling memories and weeping, weeping and recalling memories, we mourned (조상하엿다) our comrade who had gone first amidst a turbulent life (崎嶇한 일생). Among us, I, until reaching the age of thirty-five, had never cried so much for another person.\nThinking back, some years ago when I came out of Vladivostok (海參威) and arrived in North Kando (北間島), Pak Wŏn-hŭi Yŏsa was there. She was a prominent fighter (투사) of the Seoul Youth Association (서울청년회) and also a member of the Proletarian Alliance (무산자동맹회원), whose activities (足跡) extended far, domestically and abroad (국내국외), showing very steadfast engagement (꾸준한 활약) at the time. She urged me to join the Seoul Youth Association and explained the situation of the movement in Korea in detail. At that time, wanting to study socialist doctrine (사회주의 학설) further, I did not join the organization she belonged to, but we became quite close friends.\nLater, I came up to Seoul and joined the North Wind Society (北風會 북풍회). If divided by faction (派閥), she and I belonged to different groups, but in working for the overall movement, we were united (一致); she trusted me, and I trusted her considerably.\nAround that time, her husband (夫君) Kim Sa-guk (金思國) passed away from illness. From then on, Comrade Pak Wŏn-hŭi experienced much sorrow. Naturally prone to tears, she was often seen crying. We well understood her feelings after losing Kim Sa-guk, who was both a loving companion and a fellow comrade who had worked energetically alongside her. We tried to comfort her, make her laugh, and occasionally take her out for recreation, striving to erase those sad memories even for a moment. However, there was another thing that troubled Comrade Pak at that time: her daughter, Sa-ŭn, a child only two or three years old, was almost always sick. Consequently, the mother constantly had to carry the child on her back, holding medicine bottles, walking between Anguk-dong (安國洞) and Chongno (鍾路).\nThis further exhausted her health and might have been one factor contributing to her early death (早死). (Continued on page 74) <36>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis article from the July 1930 issue of \"Samch'ŏlli\" magazine consists of four separate memoirs by different authors (Chŏng Chong-myŏng, Chang Chi-yŏng, Yi Chong-nin, U Pong-un) recalling the final days and last words of four prominent Korean figures: Ch'ae Kŭrigo-ri (a recently released political prisoner), Yi Sŭng-hun (educator, founder of Osan School), Yi Sang-jae (independence activist and journalist), and Pak Wŏn-hŭi (female activist). Each piece emotionally recounts the subject's suffering, their enduring commitment to Korea (whether through political struggle, education, or social movements) even in death, and the profound grief felt by their comrades. The article provides intimate glimpses into the final moments of these individuals, emphasizing their dedication and the sorrow of their loss. Historically, the article is significant for documenting the deaths of key figures in the Korean independence and social movements during the Japanese colonial period. The mentions of Ch'ae Kŭrigo-ri's background (Russia, Greek Orthodoxy, Communism) and the specific last words urging continued effort (\"Carry on the work well!\", \"Do much work.\") highlight the ideological currents and unwavering spirit of the era. Furthermore, the accounts of Yi Sŭng-hun and Ch'ae Kŭrigo-ri requesting their bodies be used for medical science/education offer insight into progressive attitudes and a form of ultimate dedication to the nation's future, even in death, which would be of interest to historians studying social mores and nationalist sentiment.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n鄭鍾鳴\t정종명\tChŏng Chong-myŏng\n張志暎\t장지영\tChang Chi-yŏng\n李鍾麟\t이종린\tYi Chong-nin\n禹鳳雲\t우봉운\tU Pong-un\n蔡그리고리\t채그리고리\tCh'ae Kŭrigo-ri\n李昇薰\t이승훈\tYi Sŭng-hun\n南崗\t남강\tNamgang (Yi Sŭng-hun's alias)\n李商在\t이상재\tYi Sang-jae\n月南\t월남\tWŏllam (Yi Sang-jae's alias)\n朴元熙\t박원희\tPak Wŏn-hŭi\n세브란쓰 병원\t세브란스 병원\tSeverance Hospital\n南大門\t남대문\tNamdaemun\n西大門刑務所\t서대문형무소\tSŏdaemun Prison\n南山旅館\t남산여관\tNamsan Hotel\n朝鮮\t조선\tChosŏn (Korea)\n鍾路\t종로\tChongno\n莫斯科\t모스크바\tMoscow\n北京\t베이징\tPeking\n新義州\t신의주\tSinŭiju\n鴨綠江鐵橋\t압록강철교\tYalu River Railway Bridge\n東亞日報\t동아일보\tTong-A Ilbo\n朴讚熙\t박찬희\tPak Ch'an-hŭi\n宋奉瑀\t송봉우\tSong Pong-u\n朴昊辰\t박호진\tPak Ho-jin\n天道敎기념관\t천도교기념관\tCh'ŏndogyo Memorial Hall\n西伯利亞\t시베리아\tSiberia\n露西亞\t러시아\tRussia (older term)\n希臘敎\t희랍교\tGreek Orthodox Church\n神學校\t신학교\tSeminary\n平北\t평북\tP'yŏnganbuk-to (North P'yŏngan Province)\n定州\t정주\tChŏngju\n平壤\t평양\tP'yŏngyang\n義州\t의주\tŬiju\n五山面\t오산면\tOsan-myŏn\n龍洞\t용동\tYongdong\n五山學校\t오산학교\tOsan School\n滿洲\t만주\tManchuria\n濟州\t제주\tCheju\n自勉會\t자면회\tChamyŏnhoe (Self-Exertion Society)\n李氏門禊\t이씨문계\tYi Clan Association (Yi-ssi Mungy-e)\n朴基璿\t박기선\tPak Ki-sŏn\n朴健采\t박건채\tPak Kŏn-ch'ae\n張氏\t장씨\tChang-ssi (Mrs. Chang)\n李子卿\t이자경\tYi Cha-gyŏng\n京城大學\t경성대학\tKyŏngsŏng University\n齊洞\t제동\tChedong\n韓山\t한산\tHansan\n高宗\t고종\tKojong (Emperor Kojong)\n金思國\t김사국\tKim Sa-guk\n黃信德\t황신덕\tHwang Sin-dŏk\n姜아근니아\t강아근니아\tKang Agŭnnia\n思恩\t사은\tSa-ŭn (Pak Wŏn-hŭi's daughter)\n朴衡秉\t박형병\tPak Hyŏng-byŏng\n李丙儀\t이병의\tYi Pyŏng-ŭi\n任鳳淳\t임봉순\tIm Pong-sun\n宋乃浩\t송내호\tSong Nae-ho\n李恒發\t이항발\tYi Hang-bal\n任允宰\t임윤재\tIm Yun-jae\n海參威\t해삼위\tHaesamwi (Vladivostok - older name)\n北間島\t북간도\tPukkan-do (North Kando)\n서울청년회\t서울청년회\tSeoul Youth Association\n無産自動盟會員\t무산자동맹회원\tProletarian Alliance Member\n北風會\t북풍회\tPukp'unghoe (North Wind Society)\n安國洞\t안국동\tAnguk-dong\n\n**Glossary**\n\n嗚呼\t오호\tAlas!; Oh!

이곳이 어듸요」\n「병원임니다. 세부란쓰병원임니다」\n「아니오. 내 생각에는 꼭 감옥 안 갓구려. 나를 박갓헤 좀 나가게 하여주오. 나는 저 땅이 밟어보고 십구려. 남대문이고 鍾路고 네 활개치고 훨훨 단녀보고 십구려」\n「다 나으시면 단니시고 말고」\n하면서도 겨우 땅을 밟어보겟다는 것이 선생의 소원인가함애 알 수 업는 哀傷에 慰問하느라고 말하는 내 소리조차 가라안는 것을 깨달엇다. 실로 선생은 땅을 밟지 못하엿다. 莫斯科를 떠나＜28＞ 北京을 거칠 때까지는 자유의 새가 되어서 안고 십흔 가지에 안기도 하고 먹고 십흔 내물을 마시기도 하섯스련만 조선의 흙을 밟어보자 그는 이미 新義州로부터 마음과 몸이 서로 떠나는 몸이 되엇다. 억지로 녯날의 고향의 土石을 그래도 數10年만에 밟어 보앗다하면 저 鴨綠江鐵橋 우 몬지 바닥이엇슬가. 선생은 유리창밧게 初春의 잔디 우에 떠러저 타는 태양의 광선을 戀戀히- 정말 戀戀히 注視하고 잇다가 다시\n「동무!

시언한 물!」\n하고 찾기에 나는 또 다시 사이다를 한 병 사다가 대접하엿다. 그제야\n「내가 할 말이 꼭 잇는데 잇고 말고 꼭 잇는데 여러 동무! 내일 저녁 이맘 때에 다시 한번와 주오」\n그는 아직도 생명이 길어질 것만 밋엇다. 그는 압흐로 10년 20년을 살기는 긔약을 못한대도 한 두해 아니 하로 이틀은 더 살 것을 밋엇다. 맥박은 차고 피부의 열도 식어 오르고 눈도 뜨기 어려워하며 입에도 힌 거품이 돌고 목 안에서도 운명하는 때 보는 모양으로 가래가 가랑가랑하고 끌어 오르건만 아- 선생은 몃칠을 더 살 것을 밋고 또 맛나기를 기약한다. 너무 오래 잇스면 환자에게 조치 못하다는 의사의 분부로 우리들은 마지 못하여 다시 병실을 나왓다. 그때가 10점 30분. 슬프고 애처럽고 긔막힌 가슴을 안고 집에 마구 도라와 안지니 뒤다라 병원에서 사람이 달려왓다.\n「蔡先生은 도라가섯다!」\n무엇이라고. 이 슬푼 가슴을 형용할가. 그날밤 우리들은 동무는 시체를 가운데 두고 울엇다. 울고 울고 또 울엇다. 악가까지 숨쉬든 분이 잇든 방 안에 이제는 돌가치 차진 죽엄이 안저 잇슬 뿐 오직 우리에게 허락된 자유가 울어주는 것뿐이 아니든가.\n\n腦醬은 標本으로\n그 뒤 그의 유해는 생전의 뜻을 바더 조선의 新興學徒에게 보람을 주자는 뜻으로 세브란쓰 병원의 해부에 부치고 그 골격과 뇌장을 영원히 그 병원에 보관키로 하엿다.\n영결식은 봄비가 山川을 눅이는 4월 24일의 비오는 날에 天道敎기념관에서 거행되엇다. 이날 여러 단체의 吊歌와 輓狀이 압수된 것은 물론이엇다.\n이리하야 蔡선생은 영원히 가섯는데 드른 즉 그의 遺孤는 西伯利亞에 잇다하나 여러 번 전보와 편지에조차 소식이 업스니 이줄이나 알고 게신가. 선생의 畧歷은 누차 소개되엇기 새삼스레 적지 안커니와 露西亞에 가서 청년시대에 希臘敎를 밋고 神學校를 단이엇다가 1917년부터 공산운동의 투사로 나섯다 한다.\n붓을 떼려하니 하늘에 一片 구름이 떳다. 저것이 선생의 靈이신가!\n\n嗚呼, 南崗先生의 最后\n張志暎\n남강 이승훈 선생도 마저 가시다!

A little way into the heart of this neighborhood, the famous P'yŏngyang Kisaeng School reveals itself distinctly, like a half-moon amidst the clouds.\nAs P'yŏngyang is a place blessed with good water, beautiful people, and abundant goods, like Chinju (진주) in Kyŏngsang Province (경상도), song and dance developed well. As song and dance developed well, its red-light district atmosphere (紅燈情調) became surprisingly verdant, making it famous as a \"village of allure\" (色鄕) since times past. Thus, it wouldn't be strange for there to be two or three kisaeng schools, but its somewhat erotic name stirs the hearts of talented gentlemen from all 13 provinces considerably.\n\nIt was the morning of June 6th, after a sudden downpour had come twice and a period of silence had fallen, that I first set foot on the threshold of the kisaeng school. It happened to be a time of bustling construction, as a new building was rising in front of the old two-story brick schoolhouse—much like the Government-General building (총독부) sits prominently before the eyes, pushing back the An'gŭnjŏngjŏn Hall (안근정젼) within Kyŏngbokkung Palace (경복궁).\n\nNo sooner had I stepped through the main gate than—\n\"The wind that blew last night made all the peach blossoms in the garden bloom...\"\n—the melody of a *sijo* verse, and—\n\"Having aged past halfway, I cannot become young again...\"\n—the tune of *Susimga* (a folk song of sorrow), accompanied by the *changgo* drum, soared high into the sky. The scents of rouge, powder, and camellia oil assailed the nostrils like an anesthetic.\n\nBelow the wooden floor (maru), hundreds of pairs of red shoes, blue traditional shoes (*katsin*), and high-heeled Western shoes sharp as melon seeds were lined up. In the spacious rooms, partitioned by floral folding screens (花草屏風), daughters from other households, aged 13-14 to 16-17, sat in circles like rings. Some practiced the Four Gracious Plants (사군자 - plum, orchid, chrysanthemum, bamboo), some learned *kasa* narrative songs, and some performed the Monk's Dance (僧舞) and Sword Dance (劍舞). Other girls leaned against the colorfully painted wooden pillars, twisting their bodies, gazing intently at what others were doing. In all, over 200 young kisaeng (童妓) were blooming vibrantly, like a flower garden in full blossom.\nPerhaps wary of an outsider entering, they all whispered amongst themselves, lifting their heads to look at me, which was quite charming. Those pale faces with pupils black as soapberry seeds, rolling around—where could any fault lie? The dignity and beauty seen only in virgins made even the heart of a simple man like myself flutter considerably.\n\nThey seemed to follow the saying, \"You be the peony, I'll be the bellflower,\" each dressing differently. One lady wore a red *tang'ui* jacket and a skirt that flowed richly down to her ankles, while another miss wore a pale green *tang'ui* and a light green skirt hitched up high. One young woman wore a white *chŏgori* jacket and a black<37> skirt in the style of a female student with a *hisashigami* (Japanese pompadour hairstyle), while another girl wore Western-style clothes (양창) like a swallow's tail, adorned with a rose ribbon, needlessly tormenting onlookers. Even though they were all dressed differently, it was like a botanical garden where all kinds of flowers bloom together, each possessing its own charm, naturally forming a delightful flower garden of human life.\n\n\"Whose parents have raised such lovely daughters?\" I thought, my excitement building like Yi Toryŏng (리도령) climbing Kwangwallu Pavilion (광왈루), and strode briskly into the school office on the second floor.\n\"Yes, that's right. We teach them all for three years to produce famous kisaeng (명긔) who are not unduly shameful for the modernized P'yŏngyang (평양 개명),\" [said the school official].\n\"So, what subjects do you teach?\"\n\"For the first-year children, we teach songs (歌曲) like the *Ujo* and *Kyemyŏnjo* modes. That is, *P'yŏngsijo*, *Kojo*, and *Sasŏlsijo*. Besides that, we teach the Four Gracious Plants like plum, orchid, chrysanthemum, and bamboo, and even Chinese characters (漢文韻字) starting from 'sky is high, earth is low,' as well as Korean language and arithmetic.\"\n\"Don't you teach dance?\"\n\"Why wouldn't we? Dance is taught starting from the third year. But for singing, in the second year, we teach slightly more advanced *sijo* like *Kwansansikma* (關山式馬), *Paekkusa* (白鷗詞), *Hwanggyesa* (黃鷄詞), and *Ŏbusa* (漁父詞), along with orchestral instruments (관현악) such as the *saenghwang* (mouth organ), *p'iri* (oboe), *yanggeum* (dulcimer), *kŏmun'go* (zither), and *chŏttae* (flute).\"\nMr. Kim (金씨), an executive of this school, said this while showing me a kisaeng school song textbook published by the Kisŏng Kwŏnbŏn (箕城券番 - P'yŏngyang Kisaeng Association).\n\"Then, don't you teach songs like *Era Noara* or *Yangsando* and *Panga T'aryŏng*? Do you only teach *sijo*?\"\n\"Originally, just a few years ago, things like *Yangsando* or *Panga T'aryŏng* were considered demeaning (품에 객긴다), so kisaeng wouldn't even mention them. Those were songs for barmaids (색주가). However, since patrons request them, we teach them now too... but those are all learned in the third year.\"\n\"What dances do you teach?\"\n\"The Monk's Dance (僧舞) and Sword Dance (劍舞). Originally, the two basic Korean dances are the Monk's Dance and the Sword Dance, and these are quite difficult. So<38> we teach them to the third-year children. Initially, just learning how to step, how to use the torso (중둥쓰는 법), and how to move the body takes about 20 days. We put a lot of effort into Korean dance.\"\n\"What about new-style 'dance' (신식딴스)?\"\n\"'Dance' (딴스 - i.e., Western dance) is offered as an elective for those who wish to learn it.\"\n\nAs he spoke these words, his face shone with reverence for the Korean spirit (朝鮮情調) and as a defender of pure Korean art. I felt pleased.\nWe changed the subject.\n\"Upon graduating from this school, do they immediately become kisaeng?\"\n\"That's right.\"\n\"Are they all based only in P'yŏngyang? I heard that most of Seoul's top kisaeng are from P'yŏngyang. Seeing that, it seems many go to Seoul too.\"\n\"That's right. Many go to Seoul, and also to Sinŭiju or Taegu. Probably, in the four years since it became a school, two-thirds of the approximately 180 graduates have gone to other regions.\"\n\"Also, are the students who come to enroll in the kisaeng school all P'yŏngyang natives?\"\n\"There are many P'yŏngyang children, but many also come from Seoul, Hwanghae Province (황해도), and P'yŏngan Province (평안도).\"\n\"What is the current student enrollment?\"\n\"There are 195 students. By the way, please take a look at these Four Gracious Plants paintings. These were done and left behind by third-year children and graduates. Among these, there's even a work that was selected for the Government-General's Art Exhibition (총독부 미술람회).\"\nSaying this, he brought out an armful of paintings depicting plum, orchid, chrysanthemum, and bamboo, spread them out on the wooden floor (널마루바닥), and invited me to look. They were all graceful. These could evoke the image of the famous kisaeng of the old capital (王都), skilled in calligraphy and painting.\n\"Who teaches all this?\"\n\"Singing is taught by two famous kisaeng, Pak Myŏnghwa (朴明花) and Kim Haesa (金海史), and painting is taught by Master Suam (守巖선생).\"\n\nAfter browsing through the student register, filled with romantic and glamorous names reminiscent of old tales like *Kuunmong* (九雲夢), *The Romance of the Western Chamber* (西廂記), or *Ch'up'ung Kambyŏlgok* (秋風感別曲) – names like Hwasŏn (花仙), Ch'aeun (彩雲), Wŏrhyang (月香) – I went downstairs to directly observe the teaching.\n\nThe young girls sat in a circle around the teacher, singing in unison as the teacher led: the beginning phrase (*tŭlmŏri*), the long song (*kin norae*), *Nong*, *P'yŏn*, etc. Songs like \"Ch'ŏnggansu\" (맑은 시냇물 - Clear Stream Water), \"Kogoch'ŏnbin Illunhong\" (높고 높은 하늘 가에 붉은 해 하나 - A Red Sun High in the Vast Sky), and \"Ch'unhyang Kŏdong Poso\" (춘향 거동 보소 - Look at Ch'unhyang's Demeanor) emerged. Each time they sang, the way their ramie trousers were faintly visible through the light-colored skirts was innocently captivating yet troubling to a man.\n\nIn the next room, young kisaeng wearing peaked hats (*kkokkal*) and monastic robes (*changsam*) performed the Monk's Dance, the Oriole Dance (黃鶯舞), and various other dances. Accompanied by the *changgo*, *kŏmun'go*, *saenghwang*, and *p'iri*, the performance flowed quietly, like the ancient rhythm of P'aesŏng (패성 - old name for P'yŏngyang), through the old capital. Next door, slightly older girls dipped brushes of blue and yellow pigment into ink stones ground with dark ink, spread out fine floral paper (花箋), and skillfully painted scenes like bamboo from the Eight Views of Xiaoxiang (瀟湘八景) and chrysanthemums. A dot becomes a plum blossom; a drawn line, bamboo. In that bamboo grove, meeting a girl with braided hair and discussing poetry and literature (詩書), the noble youths (貴童子) of the Middle Ages seem to instantly appear before one's eyes. In any case, the painting is splendid, and their posture is also splendid.\n\nThe school's current assets are said to be around 20,000 won. It reportedly became a school four years ago in the spring.\nIt is said that when a certain Mr. Min (閔某) was the Provincial Governor (平安監事) of P'yŏngan Province, kisaeng also flourished, centered around the Yŏn'gwangjŏng Pavilion (練光亭) area. At that time, there was no formal school, but many small-scale facilities existed in the style of village schools (*sŏdang*). Whether this P'yŏngyang Kisaeng School will evolve into a revue (례뷰化), following the trends of the times like the Nippon Jikka Shōjo Kagekidan (日本實家少女歌劇團 - Japan Practical Arts Girls' Opera Troupe), or become a garden of art nurturing the unique Korean spirit, its fate will be decided before long. However, I hope it becomes a beautiful garden of art that preserves, fosters, and cultivates our disappearing Korean songs, Korean dances, Korean music, Korean clothing, and Korean sentiments. As I left the building, the students gave silent farewell nods (묵례) with eyes that seemed to greatly long for human connection. As a side note, the P'yŏngyang accent, while seemingly blunt like it's chasing you away, has a lingering charm (餘韻) that makes it hard to leave, just as the demeanor of the women infinitely attracts goodwill. This must be how the beautiful land (금수강산 - land of embroidered rivers and mountains) makes even human customs affectionate-<39>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe article describes a visit by the author, Ch'osa, to the P'yŏngyang Kisaeng School in June 1930. He details the atmosphere, the appearance and activities of the young students (aged 13-17, totaling 195), the curriculum (including traditional Korean songs like *sijo*, classical instrumental music, the Four Gracious Plants painting, Chinese characters, Korean, arithmetic, Monk's Dance, Sword Dance, and elective Western dance), and includes an interview with a school official, Mr. Kim. The author observes classes in session, praising the students' grace and the school's focus on traditional Korean arts, while noting the presence of modern influences and expressing hope that the school will preserve Korean culture rather than becoming solely entertainment-focused like Japanese revues.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, the article is significant for its portrayal of kisaeng education during the colonial period, highlighting the formalization of training and the perceived status of P'yŏngyang kisaeng. It reveals the curriculum's blend of traditional arts (music, dance, painting) deemed essential for kisaeng, alongside basic modern education (Korean, arithmetic) and even Western dance as an elective, reflecting the cultural hybridity of the time. The comparison to the Government-General building and the mention of graduates migrating to major cities like Seoul shed light on colonial power dynamics and internal migration patterns. Historians might find the explicit discussion of preserving \"Korean spirit\" (朝鮮情調) and traditional arts amidst modernization and Japanese influence particularly interesting, as well as the evolving attitudes towards certain folk songs initially deemed too low-class for kisaeng.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n西道\t서도\tSŏdo (Western Provinces, i.e., P'yŏngan-do)\n平壤\t평양\tP'yŏngyang\n련광정\t연광정\tRyŏn'gwangjŏng\n채관리\t채관리\tCh'aegwan-ri\n경상도\t경상도\tKyŏngsang-do\n진주\t진주\tChinju\n경복궁\t경복궁\tKyŏngbokkung\n안근정젼\t안근정전\tAn'gŭnjŏngjŏn\n총독부\t총독부\tCh'ongdokpu (Government-General)\n리도령\t이도령\tYi Toryŏng\n광왈루\t광월루\tKwangwŏllu (Often Kwanghallu 광한루)\n箕城券番\t기성권번\tKisŏng Kwŏnbŏn (P'yŏngyang Kisaeng Association)\n金씨\t김씨\tKim-ssi (Mr. Kim)\n朴明花\t박명화\tPak Myŏnghwa\n金海史\t김해사\tKim Haesa\n守巖\t수암\tSuam\n九雲夢\t구운몽\tKuunmong (The Cloud Dream of the Nine)\n西廂記\t서상기\tSŏsanggi (The Romance of the Western Chamber)\n秋風感別曲\t추풍감별곡\tCh'up'ung Kambyŏlgok\n黃鶯舞\t황앵무\tHwang'aengmu (Oriole Dance)\n패성\t패성\tP'aesŏng (Old name for P'yŏngyang)\n閔某\t민모\tMin Mo (A certain Mr. Min)\n練光亭\t연광정\tYŏn'gwangjŏng (Same as 련광정)\n日本實家少女歌劇團\t일본실가소녀가극단\tNippon Jikka Shōjo Kagekidan (Hepburn)\n황해도\t황해도\tHwanghae-do\n평안도\t평안도\tP'yŏngan-do\n신의주\t신의주\tSinŭiju\n대구\t대구\tTaegu\n서울\t서울\tSeoul\n\n**Glossary**\n\n긔생\t기생\tKisaeng (female entertainer/courtesan); older spelling\n모힌\t모인\tGathered; older spelling\n조곰\t조금\tA little, slightly; older spelling\n괴이하잘\t괴이하진/괴이하지 않을\t(Not) strange/odd; older negative conjugation form\n놉하\t높아\tHigh(ly); older spelling\n처자\t처자\tYoung woman, daughter\n가락지\t가락지\tRing (shape)\n사군자\t사군자\tFour Gracious Plants (plum, orchid, chrysanthemum, bamboo in painting)\n승무\t승무\tMonk's Dance (traditional Korean dance)\n검무\t검무\tSword Dance (traditional Korean dance)\n만발한\t만발한\tIn full bloom\n귀여웟다\t귀여웠다\tWas cute/charming; older spelling\n모란꼿\t모란꽃\tPeony flower; older spelling\n초롱꼿\t초롱꽃\tBellflower; older spelling\n당기\t당의\tTang'ui (type of upper garment for women in Hanbok)\n발충에\t발치에\tAt one's feet; older spelling\n거문\t검은\tBlack; older spelling\n히사시가미\t히사시가미\tHisashigami (Japanese women's pompadour hairstyle popular in the era)\n양창\t양장\tWestern-style clothing; older term\n명긔\t명기\tFamous kisaeng; older spelling\n개명\t개명\tEnlightenment, modernization\n밧게\t밖에\tBesides, outside of; older spelling\n한문운자\t한문운자\tRhyming Chinese characters (used for basic literacy)\n웨요\t왜요\tWhy?; older spelling\n긔본\t기본\tBasic, fundamental; older spelling\n관현악\t관현악\tTraditional orchestra music (wind and string)\n아해\t아이\tChild; older term\n새황\t생황\tSaenghwang (free-reed mouth organ)\n젓대\t젓대/대금\tLarge transverse bamboo flute (taegŭm)\n권번\t권번\tKisaeng association or guild\n색주가\t색주가\tBarmaid, hostess at a lower-class establishment\n품에 객긴다\t품에 깎인다\tLowers one's dignity/class (lit.

This was the Kŏngmyŏngdan (共鳴團) incident staged at Mach'i Pass (摩峙嶺) in Yangju County (楊州郡) at 2:30 PM on April 18th last year. On that day, the newspaper companies that missed this important news in their regular editions naturally began round-the-clock activities by their city desk reporters, while first informing city readers of this sudden event through extras (號外). Some went to the scene to investigate the circumstances of the incident's occurrence, some went to the police department to find out the security measures and direction of activities, and some visited the victims to hear about the appearance and words of the pistol squad. As I was working indoors for the city desk, and the city desk chief happened to be out, I was tied to the telephone, synthesizing various pieces of information, coordinating communication among colleagues active outside, and inevitably had to take charge of editing the city page that would report the progress of this major incident.\n\nIn such extraordinary times, the competition among companies becomes fierce. The common concern of the reporters at hand is to create a more distinctive page than other newspapers by reporting the truth of the incident more meticulously, more accurately, and more swiftly. Therefore, in the evening edition of the following 19th (dated the 20th), each newspaper devoted its full effort to reporting this incident. The content was mostly a detailed report of the previous day's extra, with little significant new information. When and where would the vanished pistol squad reappear, and what kind of incident might they cause again? Would a clash involving casualties occur, given that several hundred armed police officers had been mobilized? Might another newspaper company have already learned something new and started preparing an extra? All sorts of doubts arose. We alerted the communication agencies in key locations in Kangwŏn Province (江原道) and Kyŏnggi Province (京畿道) to perform their best activities and kept watch by the telephone, but that day passed uneventfully.\n\nThe 20th arrived. Around 10:30 AM, we <40> heard news that one member of the pistol squad had been captured at Paekkok-san (栢局¯山 - likely 柏谷山) in Yangju. While one reporter drove an automobile to the scene, amidst the clamor for \"Extra! Extra!\", colleague Mr. J rushed in, his face pale as a sheet. \"Pistol squad! Pistol squad!\" he shouted, his pencil flying across the manuscript paper. His report stated that the remaining two members had reappeared at Mang'u-ri (忘憂里) in Kuri-myŏn (九里面), Yangju, commandeered another passing automobile, drove it themselves into Kyŏngsŏng (京城) city, and vanished. This news instantly became a four-fold large extra (四折 大號外), tied to the delivery boys' waists, and flew here and there like the ringing of bells. When we received a call confirming our extra was somewhat faster than others, the fatigue of the past few days seemed to wash away, but the extra battle (號外戰) was now heating up. A 120-member police death squad (決死警官隊), organized into six teams centered around the Kyŏnggi Province Police Department, was transported to various locations in fire engines. Mounted police officers carrying rifles crisscrossed north and south, and guards with rifles and bayonets stood at key points, searching pedestrians' bodies. Kyŏngsŏng city, completely in an XX-state (XX狀態化 - likely implying martial law or high alert), saw tense moments filled with killing intent pass by, minute by minute, second by second.\n\nWe extended the editing deadline (마감) by 30 minutes to 2:30, but there was no news of a clash between the pistol squad and the police. We first sent out the evening edition regular paper. How can one describe our feelings when sending readers a newspaper that was almost blank due to confiscation (押收) and deletion (削除)? Even a line or two of text that reached the lead plate (鉛版) through desperate effort (중략-원문 - ellipsis in original) trembles. But this was no time to stand still. Activities had to continue. We had to inform the 300,000 citizens, thirsty as if for water, about the developments (趨移) of the incident. Following the constantly shifting center of security—to the pine forest of Namsan (南山), to the Yŏŭido (汝矣島) airfield, to Pugak-san (北岳山), etc.—the reporters' activities continued, their entire nervous systems sharpened like blades.\n\nThe 20th drew to a close with two armed direct-action activists still hidden in the heart of Great Kyŏngsŏng (大京城). The grim sight of bayonets, like frost and snow (霜雪가튼), made the hearts of peaceful citizens pound. While the terrifying eyes of the police officers watched this alley and that street corner, heavy rain poured down. It was an unspeakably tragic and grimly silent (肅殺스런) night. In the editorial office of our newspaper company, located at the Hwangt'ohyŏn (黃土峴) intersection, only Mr. C, the bureau chief at the time, and I sat facing each other, anxiously waiting, wondering what might happen next. The telephones before and behind us rang incessantly with updates from colleagues out in the field.\n\nThus, as the day was nearly over, around 11 PM, huge news came from Mr. P, who was watching the Police Department. Someone had been caught at a certain place in Hwanggeum-jŏng (黃金町). We spent 10 minutes verifying its certainty, and 40 minutes later, the extra went out. Hearing that the captured man was Yi Sŏn-gu (李善九) from Sinŭiju (新義州), we urgently called the Sinŭiju bureau chief by telephone to inquire about his identity, background, and character. While preparing the second extra, we received information from a Japanese newspaper reporter, with whom we had arranged contact beforehand, that the whereabouts of the remaining one member had also been definitively determined, and officers from Chongno Station (鍾路署) had surrounded the location and were waiting for daylight. An extra covering half a page (半頁 大號外), combining this with photos taken by Mr. H <41> while fighting through the pouring rain and police interference, was sent out—only to be confiscated entirely!\n\nNow, only one extra remained. It was certain that one of two events would occur: either the remaining uncaught member would be captured safely, or he would die after exchanging fire with the police. Determined to get this final extra out earlier than any other newspaper, we prepared two versions and even made stereotype matrices (紙型). One read, \"After Exchanging Fire with Police, One Finally Killed!\" and the other, \"Ringleader Also Captured!\" We planned to send out whichever one matched the event. Our prediction proved correct, and we sent out the latter extra at 5:10 AM on the 21st. Not only did the extra come out just 10 minutes after the final capture of Ch'oe Yang-ok (崔養玉) at exactly 5:00 AM, but at Mr. C's insistence, we also distinguished ourselves by publishing the names of the three pistol squad members as Kŏngmyŏngdan (共鳴團) members Ch'oe Yang-ok, Kim Chŏng-nyŏn (金正連), and Yi Sŏn-gu (李善九). Thinking back on it now, it's still gratifying.\n\nStanding on the Extra Battlefront\nChungoe Ilbo Company, Hong Chong-in\n\nThe bustling crowd of \"rush hour\" (으럿쉬 아워), the chaotic mix of sounds from trams, cars, oxcarts, and horse carts running. Piercing through this, the noisy ringing of the extra bell, further sharpening the nerves of hypersensitive city dwellers! \"Extra!\" \"Extra!\" This sound of the extra bell, indeed, like the siren (悲鳴?) of a fire engine racing through the night streets, is likely a distinctive sound that overwhelmingly \"leads\" the \"jazz\"-like (쨔즈的) clamor of the modern city. City dwellers, spending their days in bustle and tension, experience complex emotions—excitement, emotion, anxiety, impatience, or interest—simultaneously whenever they hear this bell, waiting for the next extra, the next evening edition, the next morning paper. Sometimes, people's cruel side, which has existed since ancient times, wonders about the explosion or sudden outbreak of an incident, perhaps even more hatefully than its resolution, is \"slightly\" stronger in city dwellers.\n\nHere, the psychology of the reporter standing on the front line of extra reporting. It can be seen as representing the gambling-like (賭博的) psychology pinned on the extra by tens of millions of readers. However, amidst watching the event with wide-open eyes, touching things, and running around, it's not just a simple gambling-like or competitive psychology. What can be done about the sorrowful times when the pen cannot move and the mouth cannot open?\n\nThe Extra Battle (號外戰), requiring the mobilization of the entire company staff to exert full efficiency. Here, there are also many enemies (敵?). Firstly, competition and vigilance among fellow businesses, <42> the extreme secrecy of police activities, confiscation or publication ban orders from the Police Affairs Bureau (警務局), etc. Perhaps the \"fine play\" (파인·풀레이) of the extra battle exists because of such enemies and obstacles. Well then, as requested, let's try to tell the inside story (裡面 니야기) of the extra battle.\n\nThe recent intense and interesting extra battle that comes to mind like lightning is the Kŏngmyŏng <43>团 incident (共鳴團事件). A bizarre unfolding of events—bold actions penetrating the iron-wall-like security and investigation network of thousands of police officers to enter Kyŏngsŏng city! The police's confusion and anxiety at that time need no further mention.\nOn the afternoon of April 18th last year, a modern-style \"hold-up\" occurred, attacking the Red Automobile (紅自動車) on the Mang'u-ri (忘憂里) pass. A group of newspaper reporters (mostly from the city desks of various companies), who were out viewing the night cherry blossoms (夜櫻) at Ch'anggyŏngwŏn (昌慶苑), were each talking as if they regarded the incident lightly, seemingly unaware. In fact, many reporters didn't know until then. Suddenly, a tense look couldn't help but cross the faces of that group. Gathered under the shade of fully bloomed flowers beneath the bright moonlight (皎皎한 月下), the group feigned ignorance (시치미를 딱 떼이고) and dispersed.\nThe first report was successfully made by chance in that day's evening edition of the Chosŏn Sinmun, but others belatedly issued extras that night and into the early morning. Then, the next day, the 19th, the evening editions of each company were filled entirely with articles about the Kŏngmyŏngdan. All reported something like, \"Kŏngmyŏngdan vanishes towards Ch'ŏnma-san (天摩山), armed police cordon off and pursue...\" However, nobody could have imagined, even in their dreams, that on the morning of the 20th, they would stop a passenger bus on the Kyŏngch'un Highway (京春街道) again, drive it themselves, and enter the city. We had been making the ordinary assumption that they would inevitably clash with the police in some mountain or cross the border, so we couldn't help but be surprised. Although somewhat recovered from the previous day's fatigue, I called the office relatively early, and received such urgent news (急報). The order was to come to the office immediately. From here, the Extra Battle began. At that time, our company's distribution staff member happened to be passing through Sup'yo-jŏng (水標町) and heard the commotion from the 00 Automobile Company (00自動車部) where the car the Kŏngmyŏngdan members had arrived in was, recounting the whole story of the incident. He reported it to the company, and we started working on the extra.\n\nWith the order given, the front-line deployment was complete. All city desk members were assigned duty at each police station (署). Field reporters (外勤) were to send articles entirely by phone, and the department head was to handle editing, while Mr. Kim from the Arts and Sciences Department (學藝部) handled telephone communication and writing articles. The remaining members were to act as mobile support (遊擊), assisting reporters covering the city's security situation and the shifting investigation headquarters. At that time, all police divisions—Sanitation, Security, Judiciary (衛生保安 司法)—were mobilized. Even Training Center police officers (講習所巡査) carried rifles, and units marched crisscrossing the roads in the rain, as if in urban warfare. The evening edition was about to come out. In the afternoon, rain drizzled, and the Kŏngmyŏngdan members' whereabouts still seemed vague (渺茫한 듯). The police felt they had to find their location before nightfall. Moreover, the rain made the investigation more difficult, and there was great anxiety that, being armed with pistols, they might cause some danger at night. Seeing the anxious police, reporters unable to get follow-up news began to show signs of fatigue. Around 4:30 PM, a detective appeared flustered (蒼黃히) before Inspector Miwa (三輪警部) of the Higher Section (高等係) at the almost empty Chongno Station, and the two went into a separate room. For us, who had come up to the second floor by chance with reporter Mr. Im/Lim (林君), assigned there for support, it was instantly perceived as a new lead! <45>\n\nInspector Miwa emerged from the separate room with a lively expression. We followed and asked, but he replied, \"No! Not yet! Well! Nothing yet!\" and slipped downstairs without even putting on his hat. Suspicious, we pretended not to notice and followed him down. In a side room on the lower floor, about ten newspaper reporters were present. Stepping outside the entrance, he quickly got into a car. We also got into the car we had arranged. Following that, all the cars from various companies parked in front of the police station gate followed suit. We went to the 00 Inn in Chŏksŏn-dong (積善洞). Upon arrival, about ten detectives were lying in ambush nearby. Inspector Miwa, who had entered house number 0 in Kan-dong (諫洞), came out carrying something wrapped in a cloth (褓). \"What is it?\" \"Uh—well—it belongs to the criminal!\"... It became clear that the criminal's whereabouts were almost revealed. And what he carried out in that cloth was Yi Sŏn-gu's pistol. As night fell, detective squad (刑事隊) cars became frequent in front of the Chongno Station gate.\n\nThe police were saying, \"Now we just have to wait until morning!\" At that time, curious about possible follow-up news, I went back to the house in Kan-dong where Yi Sŏn-gu's pistol had been retrieved. As I approached the gate, suddenly a voice called out from beside the gate, \"Who's there!\" Looking closely, 3 or 4 plainclothes policemen were guarding it. They said, \"Anyone who comes in cannot be let out. Even newspaper reporters, for the sake of the investigation... \" and held onto me, refusing to let go. Not only was there the responsibility that my activities would be cut off if I couldn't leave, but the thought also entered my head: what if the Kŏngmyŏngdan came back to that house that night? If pistols were eventually fired by both sides, sitting there in the same place as the police... The fear of what might happen, more than just imagination, filled my mind. When I finally managed to get out after about an hour and a half, my heart was pounding. This is a personal anecdote (挿話).\n\nAround 10 PM, one Kŏngmyŏngdan member, Yi Sŏn-gu, was captured by the police department in Hwanggeum-jŏng. At that time, there was already a warning from the police not to write about the criminals' whereabouts in the extras. Extras circulated again. With Yi Sŏn-gu caught, the remaining issue was the whereabouts of Ch'oe Yang-ok.\nChongno Station, having proceeded almost parallel to the police department's activities, likely felt somewhat frustrated at this point. Through Yi Sŏn-gu's interrogation, Ch'oe Yang-ok's location also became certain: house number 0 in Ch'ebu-dong (軆府洞). By 2 AM, the newspaper reporters all knew the location. The police even boasted that they would catch him when dawn broke, telling us to wait and watch.\n\nThe company, receiving calls moment by moment, ordered us to come in briefly to rest before going out again. When everyone gathered, the then-Editor-in-Chief Ha Mong (何夢) and other executives were all sitting there, having made all preparations (萬端). The instruction was to sleep briefly before going out for the next day's activities. However, several colleagues were sleeping sitting on chairs at the police station along with other reporters. When we mobilized again as dawn broke, Ch'oe was captured by Chongno Station without issue. It would soon be broad daylight. <44> The remaining issue for each company was the evening edition of that day, the 20th. How to report the events of the past three days in detail and uniquely? The police department announced they would release information at 11 AM. At that time, we decided to finish editing by the time of the announcement to get the newspaper out before anyone else. That's right. The course and context (脈絡) of the events were generally known without needing to see the detailed (區區히) announcement. The police, also tired, delayed the announcement until around PM. Our editing was also delayed until about 1 PM. However, compared to other companies waiting for the announcement materials, our evening edition came out one to two hours earlier. Moreover, the article visiting Ch'oe's family was only in our newspaper.\nThat day was also a Sunday. The satisfaction of viewing the night blossoms (밤꼿) at Ch'anggyŏngwŏn without worry, azaleas in full bloom after the big event was over! The memory of the Kŏngmyŏngdan appearing and disappearing dozens of times in my dreams that night also remains deep.\n\nActivities Beyond the Police, Beyond the Telegram\nChosŏn Ilbo Company, Yu Kwang-nyŏl\n\nWhenever major incidents occur suddenly like a thunderbolt, newspaper companies have issued extras, and this has happened many times already. Looking just at the extras issued in the last 4 or 5 years, there was the Yi Su-hŭng (李壽興) incident involving the attack on city pawnshops, the Kim Yak-su (金若水) et al.'s Chosŏn Communist Party incident, the passing of Emperor Sunjonghyo (純宗孝皇帝), the Chinmyŏng Girls' School (進明女學校) tram overturning incident, or the surprising movements in Seoul city during the Kwangju (光州) incident last winter...\nWhenever such surprising events occurred, newspaper companies indeed moved their entire functions most agilely, aiming to inform the world of these facts even one minute, one second faster, creating extras and scattering them like falling snow (白雪날니듯) upon the crowds coming and going on the main streets of the capital (長安大路). This was the duty of the newspaper company, entrusted with the responsibility of reporting all events happening in the world most swiftly. Thus, when these extras spread, starting from Seoul city and via express trains to large cities like P'yŏngyang (平壤), Taegu (大邱), and Inch'ŏn (仁川), accompanied by the jingling bell sounds, it needs no further telling how much they excited and made anxious (초조케) the public mind.\nNow, among all these past incidents, I will report here the scene of the Chosŏn Ilbo Company's activities during the Kŏngmyŏngdan incident involving Kim Chŏng-nyŏn (金正連) and Ch'oe Yang-ok (崔養玉), graduates of P'yŏngyang Sungdae (崇大 - likely Soongsil University), which remains in people's memory as the most sensationalistic (센세나리틱한) and surprising event. <46> It is unforgettable. On that day, April 18th last year, there were no particularly world-shaking events in Seoul city or elsewhere in Chosŏn (朝鮮). After editing the city page as usual and publishing the newspaper, I returned to my lodging and happened to see a distributed (配布된) Japanese-language paper, and learned that, completely unexpectedly, a surprising incident had occurred (이러낫섯다) on the Kyŏngch'un Highway (京春街道) at Mang'u-ri (忘憂里) pass, not far (멀지 안는) from Seoul. The substance of the incident was that around 2 PM that day, as the Kyŏngsŏng Post Office (京城郵便局) transport automobile, which always carried a large amount of cash between Kyŏngsŏng and Ch'unch'ŏn (春川), was crossing the not-so-deep Mang'u-ri pass, several sturdy men (壯漢) with 6-shot revolvers (6穴砲) appeared from the grassy roadside, fired pistols into the air (탕탕 쏘면서) threateningly, snatched the bag containing cash, took the driver into the mountains and tied him up (結縛지우고), subsequently stopped (스텁) another passenger automobile that came along, received money and valuables from the passengers, and then claimed they were people who had come (드러온) from the Shanghai 00 Group (上海00團) to raise military funds (軍資金), even giving a speech about 00 before leaving. That was the outline (개략) of the incident. Upon hearing this urgent report (급보), several hundred armed police officers from nearby police stations and the Kyŏnggi Province Police Department rushed (急行) to the scene. The fact that two automobiles were attacked on a major road like the Kyŏngch'un Highway in broad daylight, and especially the point that they were the 00 Army from Shanghai, was truly startling. All the facts were novel (奇拔) and audacious, things even Americans might do, too large, too grand (웅장하엿다). I immediately ran back to the newspaper office, sent a resourceful field reporter to the Kyŏnggi Province Police Department to ascertain the truth (事實正否), and also sent telegrams to the Ch'unch'ŏn and nearby bureaus, instructing them to find out the true nature of the incident and wire back. At that time, a kind of premonition (豫感) entered my head; it felt like this incident would definitely not end here but would develop even more sensationally.\nA little later, a call came from the field reporter who had gone hurriedly (황황히) by rickshaw. The automobile attack was true; just a short while ago, terrifyingly armed police officers in multiple cars had departed for Mang'u-ri. Inside the Police Department, the police chief and various station chiefs were coming and going, and calls kept coming from the Police Affairs Bureau urging follow-up reports, but there was still no word of the criminals being caught, nor any clue about their affiliation (系統). In short, it was described as being completely in a fog (五里霧中). With no further way to find out more, that night, holding an anxious heart, we first published the facts as an extra and just went to sleep.\nThe next morning, the entire company staff waited, extremely tense, for the arrival of startling news, but there was nothing more to report beyond the details (詳報) of yesterday. However, thinking that at any moment they might be exchanging fire with the several hundred armed police, my heart could not rest easy (노이지 안엇다) at all. Another night passed amidst uncertainty. On the morning of the third day, around 10 AM, a major event occurred that sharpened the nerves of the entire newspaper company like a needle point: two members of the pistol squad, having penetrated the security net of thousands of police officers, reappeared on the Kyŏngch'un Road (京春街頭), seized a passing automobile (빼앗 - this seems to be cut off, original text likely continued '앗아 타고' - seized and rode) (Continued on page 24) <47>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe article consists of three accounts from journalists at rival Korean newspapers (Tonga Ilbo, Chungoe Ilbo, Chosŏn Ilbo) detailing their experiences covering the sensational \"Kŏngmyŏngdan Incident\" in April 1929. The incident involved armed men robbing automobiles near Seoul, claiming affiliation with a Shanghai group, evading a massive police manhunt, boldly reappearing in Seoul, and their eventual capture over three days. The journalists describe the intense competition between newspapers to publish extras (호외) with the latest news, the round-the-clock work, the anxiety and excitement, the challenges posed by police secrecy and censorship (confiscations, publication bans), and the meticulous planning involved in trying to scoop competitors, including preparing multiple versions of the final extra anticipating different outcomes.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, the article offers a vivid glimpse into the high-pressure environment of colonial Korean journalism, highlighting the fierce rivalry, the pursuit of sensational news, and the operational constraints imposed by the Japanese colonial authorities (police control, censorship). It also provides a contemporary, albeit journalistically focused, narrative of a significant event involving armed resistance or banditry (the Kŏngmyŏngdan), showcasing the scale of the colonial police response and the public fascination with such dramatic occurrences. Historians might find the detailed procedural accounts of news gathering, extra production, and the journalists' interactions with police particularly valuable for understanding media operations and state control in 1930s Korea.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n共鳴團\t공명단\tKŏngmyŏngdan\n東亞日報\t동아일보\tTonga Ilbo\n金枓白\t김두백\tKim Tu-baek\n楊州郡\t양주군\tYangju-gun\n摩峙嶺\t마치령\tMach'i-ryŏng\nJ군\tJ군\tMr.

Having passed through the stages of dissemination and education, it has now entered the crucial stage of practical implementation. Especially since Shōwa 13 [1938], the promotion of establishing and implementing \"Farm Household Economic Revitalization Plans\" (農家經濟更生計畫), tailored to the specific circumstances of each village (部落), has been strongly encouraged as a central focus. Consequently, by the end of March this year [1940], plans had been established in approximately 15,000 villages, covering about 1,050,000 households, representing roughly 50% of the total farm households on the peninsula (半島).\n\nFurthermore, with the expansion and intensification of the current situation [wartime], the importance of rural village promotion has increasingly been recognized. Various promotion policies have been established, and remarkable activities are unfolding across the peninsula. Now, based on the results achieved so far, and in light of the current situation, I wish to discuss the future prospects of this movement.\n\n<33>\nThe Farm Household Economic Revitalization Plan, which is the core of the current Rural Village Promotion Movement, is essentially a concrete action plan for farm household management established by the farmers themselves. Its primary characteristic lies in the voluntary participation of the farmers. While based on the principle of self-help and revitalization through the farmers' own power, the plans are formulated under the guidance of the authorities, ensuring they are appropriate, rational, and integrated with various national policies. Specifically, guidance is provided to ensure these plans align with policies such as the Plan for Increased Production of Staple Foods (主要食糧增産計畫), the Seven-Year Plan for Increasing Northern Cotton and Wool Production (北鮮綿羊増殖七箇年計畫), the Plan for Expanding Raw Cotton Production (棉花増産擴充計畫), and the Plan for Securing Military Horses (軍馬資源涵養計畫). The goal is for each farm household to eliminate debt within roughly five years, achieve self-sufficiency in staple foods, accumulate assets for reproduction, and ultimately establish a self-reliant and stable economic foundation.\n\nThe process for establishing these plans involves, first, the selection of villages deemed suitable for implementing revitalization plans by the county chief (郡守) or island governor (島司). Then, under the guidance of officials from the county/island, police station (警察署), financial association (金融組合), agricultural association (農會), irrigation association (水利組合), and other related administrative bodies, the village head (部落長), promotion committee members (振興委員), and representatives of the farmers collaborate to investigate the actual conditions of the village and draft a plan tailored to its specific circumstances. This draft is then reviewed and finalized by the \"Village Revitalization Plan Deliberation Committee\" (部落更生計畫審議會), composed of the aforementioned guiding officials.\n\n<34>\nOnce a plan is established for a village, each constituent farm household formulates its own individual revitalization plan based on the village plan, again receiving guidance from the authorities. The implementation of these established plans is then carried out through the farmers' own voluntary efforts and practices. However, guidance and supervision are provided by the authorities as needed. The prefectural governor (府尹), county chief, island governor, police chief (警察署長), and heads of relevant local agencies form a guidance structure, collaborating closely to oversee the plan's execution.\n\nFurthermore, within the village, a \"Village Promotion Committee\" (部落振興委員會) is established, comprising influential figures within the community. This committee plays a central role in promoting cooperation, harmony, and collective action among the villagers, facilitating the smooth implementation of the plan.\n\nCrucially, the foundation of this movement lies in spiritual revitalization. Fostering the spirit of diligence, self-help, autonomy, and cooperation among farmers is paramount. Therefore, alongside the economic revitalization plan, strong emphasis is placed on spiritual cultivation and lifestyle improvement (生活改善). Various lectures, workshops, and model examples are utilized to instill these values. Model villages (模範部落) are designated to serve as benchmarks, and their successes are widely publicized to encourage emulation by other villages.\n\nRegarding the financial aspects necessary for implementing the revitalization plans, the primary focus is on eliminating existing farm household debt (農家負債). Efforts are made to organize and consolidate these debts. For necessary revitalization funds (更生資金), measures are taken to provide long-term, low-interest loans through financial associations and the Oriental Development Company (東洋拓殖株式會社).\n\n<35>\nAs discussed above, the Rural Village Promotion Movement, centered on the Farm Household Economic Revitalization Plan, has achieved significant results and is expected to play an increasingly vital role, especially under the current wartime situation (時局下). Strengthening the home front structure (銃後體制強化) is an urgent task for the peninsula today, and stabilizing and improving the livelihoods of farmers, who constitute the majority of the population, is a prerequisite for achieving this.\n\nMoreover, securing food supplies is fundamental to national defense (國防). Ensuring self-sufficiency in food for the peninsula's population and increasing production to contribute to the empire's food supply are critical missions assigned to Korean agriculture (朝鮮農業). The successful execution of the Rural Village Promotion Movement is directly linked to fulfilling these missions.\n\nTherefore, the Rural Village Promotion Movement is not merely about the economic well-being of individual farmers; it is intrinsically connected to strengthening the national structure and holds immense significance for the construction of the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere (東亞協同體). It is believed that through the concerted efforts of the government and the people (官民一體), this movement will steadily advance, bearing fruit in the establishment of bright farming villages (明朗農村) across the peninsula, thereby contributing significantly to the nation.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis 1940 article by Sekihara Kiyoshi, a Japanese official in the Government-General of Korea's Agriculture Bureau, outlines the progress and future prospects of the Korean Rural Village Promotion Movement (朝鮮農村振興運動). Initiated in 1932, the movement shifted focus in 1938 to implementing \"Farm Household Economic Revitalization Plans\" (農家經濟更生計畫) in villages across Korea. These plans, emphasizing voluntary farmer participation but guided by Japanese authorities, aimed to eliminate debt, increase agricultural production (aligned with Japanese wartime needs like cotton and food), foster self-sufficiency, and instill values like diligence and cooperation within about five years. The article highlights the integration of these plans with broader Japanese imperial goals, such as strengthening the home front (銃後體制強化) and contributing to the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere (東亞協同體).\n\nFrom a historical perspective, the article is revealing in its depiction of Japanese colonial policy in rural Korea during wartime. It showcases the dual nature of the promotion movement: presented as a benevolent effort towards farmer self-help and modernization (\"bright farming villages\"), while simultaneously serving clear imperial objectives of resource extraction (food, cotton, wool), social control (spiritual cultivation, lifestyle improvement), and mobilization for the war effort. Historians might find the emphasis on \"voluntary\" participation under authoritative \"guidance,\" the detailed structure of control involving various officials (county chiefs, police), and the explicit linking of rural development to Japan's geopolitical ambitions particularly illustrative of the mechanisms and ideology of Japanese colonialism in its later stages.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n朝鮮\t조선\tChosŏn\n關原清\t세키하라 기요시\tSekihara Kiyoshi\n朝鮮総督府\t조선총독부\tChosŏn Ch'ongdokpu (Government-General of Korea)\n半島\t반도\tPando (Peninsula, referring to Korea)\n北鮮\t북선\tPuksŏn (Northern Korea)\n郡守\t군수\tKunsu (County Chief)\n島司\t도사\tTosa (Island Governor)\n警察署\t경찰서\tKyŏngch'alsŏ (Police Station)\n金融組合\t금융조합\tKŭmyung Chohap (Financial Association)\n農會\t농회\tNonghoe (Agricultural Association)\n水利組合\t수리조합\tSuri Chohap (Irrigation Association)\n府尹\t부윤\tPuyun (Prefectural Governor)\n東洋拓殖株式會社\t동양척식주식회사\tTongyang Ch'ŏkchik Chusik Hoesa (Oriental Development Company)\n東亞協同體\t동아협동체\tTong-A Hyŏptongch'e (East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere)\n\n**Glossary**\n\n朝鮮農村振興運動\tちょうせんのうそんしんこううんどう\tKorean Rural Village Promotion Movement\n展望\tてんぼう\tProspects; Outlook\n論說\tろんせつ\tCommentary; Essay; Editorial\n農家經濟更生計畫\tのうかけいざいこうせいけいかく\tFarm Household Economic Revitalization Plan\n部落\tぶらく\tVillage; Hamlet (often used for smaller rural units)\n半島\tはんとう\tPeninsula (here referring to the Korean Peninsula)\n時局\tじきょく\tThe current situation (often referring to wartime conditions)\n自主的\tじしゅてき\tVoluntary; Autonomous\n主要食糧増産計畫\tしゅようしょくりょうぞうさんけいかく\tPlan for Increased Production of Staple Foods\n北鮮綿羊増殖七箇年計畫\tほくせんめんようぞうしょくしちかねんけいかく\tSeven-Year Plan for Increasing Northern Korean Cotton and Wool Production\n棉花増産擴充計畫\tめんかぞうさんかくじゅうけいかく\tPlan for Expanding Raw Cotton Production\n軍馬資源涵養計畫\tぐんばしげんかんようけいかく\tPlan for Securing Military Horse Resources\n負債\tふさい\tDebt; Liabilities\n部落更生計畫審議會\tぶらくこうせいけいかくしんぎかい\tVillage Revitalization Plan Deliberation Committee\n部落振興委員會\tぶらくしんこういいんかい\tVillage Promotion Committee\n精神作興\tせいしんさっこう\tSpiritual revitalization/cultivation\n生活改善\tせいかつかいぜん\tLifestyle improvement\n模範部落\tもはんぶらく\tModel village\n更生資金\tこうせいしきん\tRevitalization funds\n銃後體制強化\tじゅうごたいせいきょうか\tStrengthening the home front structure\n國防\tこくぼう\tNational defense\n朝鮮農業\tちょうせんのうぎょう\tKorean agriculture\n官民一體\tかんみんいったい\tGovernment and people as one body; Unity of public and private sectors\n明朗農村\tめいろうのうそん\tBright/Cheerful farming village\n\n\n---------------------------","magazine":"『朝鮮及満洲』","date":"昭和十五年十月一日 (October 1, 1940)","title":"Pilgrimage to Scholars' Research Labs (1): Dr. Oh (Medical Doctor), Researching Bacteria to Save One Million Leprosy Patients (Alias: Chwi-gong)"},{"path":"07_1930.07/200.txt","issue":"07_1930.07","content":"\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n\n","title":"Artists' Debut Works"},{"path":"07_1930.07/210.txt","issue":"07_1930.07","content":"**<28>**\n\n**Roundtable Discussion on Local Entertainment**\n\n*   Time: January 28th, 2 PM\n*   Place: Chōsen Hotel Tea Room\n*   Attendees: Kim Munjip, Kim Sangyong, Pak T'aewŏn, Yu Chino (in order of seating), Moderator (Editor-in-Chief)\n\n**Moderator:** Recently, various discussions about local culture have arisen from many quarters. Among these, local entertainment is a significant issue directly connected to the lives of the masses. This magazine also considers this problem important, and so we have arranged this roundtable discussion today, inviting you all here despite your busy schedules. It seems that our traditional local entertainment has significantly declined, almost to the point of extinction, while new forms of entertainment have not yet taken root among the general populace. Consequently, the lives of the masses seem extremely monotonous and dry. It appears that gambling (노름), which can hardly be called entertainment, is prevalent only in certain areas. We would like to hear your frank opinions on the current state of local entertainment, its points of decline, the reasons for it, and any constructive alternatives. First, Mr. Kim Munjip, please share your thoughts on the current situation.\n\n**Kim Munjip:** When we speak of local entertainment, it seems to broadly encompass everything except what might be called urban entertainment. However, the concept of 'local' itself is quite ambiguous. Does it refer to agricultural villages? Fishing villages? Mountain villages? Or perhaps towns below the level of *ŭp* (邑)? The entertainment in each of these areas likely differs. Therefore, discussing 'local entertainment' as a single entity seems problematic from the outset. Generally, when we talk about local entertainment, we mostly refer to entertainment in agricultural villages. Looking at the current state of entertainment in these villages, as the moderator pointed out, it seems almost non-existent. Compared to the past, it has indeed severely declined. In the past, there were various seasonal customs (세시풍속) throughout the year – kite flying around the first full moon, *ch'ajŏnnori* (차전놀이), *sŏkchŏn* (석전), tug-of-war, mask dances (탈춤), puppet plays (꼭둑각시놀음), *nongak* (농악), shamanistic rituals (*kut*, 굿), and *p’ansori* (판소리), among others. These constituted the mainstream of past local entertainment. However, these have almost disappeared now. If anything remains, it might be *yutnori* (윷놀이) or flower card games (*hwatu*, 花鬪牌). Even *yutnori* seems less common now. Flower card games, which were originally gambling, seem to have become the representative form of entertainment. Traditional folk songs (민요) also seem to have vanished. Of course, new songs are spreading via radio and records, but it seems doubtful whether these have truly become the villagers' own entertainment.\n\n**Moderator:** Mr. Kim Sangyong, what are your thoughts?\n\n**Kim Sangyong:** I also believe that traditional local entertainment has largely disappeared. Activities like *nongak*, mask dances, puppet plays, *p’ansori*, and folk songs, which could be considered representative of traditional entertainment, are nearly gone. It’s hard to pinpoint the exact reasons for this decline. Perhaps the infiltration of modern civilization has rendered these old forms tasteless? Or maybe economic hardship has robbed people of the leisure (여가) to enjoy entertainment? Or perhaps it’s due to suppression by the authorities (관헌)? It’s likely a combination of these factors. In any case, the decline is undeniable. As Mr. Kim Munjip mentioned, only gambling like flower card games seems prevalent. This is truly deplorable.\n\n**<29>**\n\n**Pak T’aewŏn:** I haven't directly observed the situation in rural areas recently, so I can't speak confidently. However, based on common sense, it seems plausible that traditional entertainment has declined significantly. But is it accurate to say it has *completely* disappeared? I wonder if that's an exaggeration stemming from the intellectuals' perspective. While large-scale, village-wide traditional events might have diminished, perhaps smaller, simpler forms of entertainment still exist? For instance, maybe folk songs haven't entirely vanished but are sung individually or in small groups? Also, regarding gambling, while flower card games might be prevalent, isn't it possible that other forms of gambling exist too? However, I agree that, overall, traditional entertainment is in decline, and constructive forms are scarce.\n\n**Yu Chino:** I agree with the general consensus that traditional local entertainment has severely declined. While the exact reasons are complex, as Mr. Kim Sangyong pointed out, the influence of modern civilization seems undeniable. Old forms feel outdated and uninteresting. Economic hardship is certainly a factor too. People lack the time and resources for entertainment. Suppression might also play a role, especially for large gatherings. However, I think the most fundamental reason is the change in lifestyle and consciousness. Traditional entertainment was deeply rooted in the old communal way of life and worldview. As these change, the entertainment based on them naturally loses its foundation. The problem is that new, healthy forms of entertainment haven't filled the void. Instead, only degenerative forms like gambling or passive consumption of entertainment like radio and records seem to be spreading.\n\n**Moderator:** So, everyone seems to agree that traditional local entertainment is in decline, and healthy alternatives are lacking, with gambling being a significant issue. What could be the alternatives? Mr. Yu, could you elaborate on potential constructive entertainment?\n\n**Yu Chino:** It's not easy to suggest specific alternatives. Creating new forms of entertainment isn't something that can be done overnight. However, perhaps we can find clues by looking at what forms of entertainment are currently enjoyed, even if passively. Radio, records, and movies (영화) are popular. While these are mostly consumed passively, could they be developed into more active forms? For example, could communities organize gatherings to listen to the radio or watch movies together, followed by discussions? Could existing folk songs be revived or adapted? Could new creative activities, like simple drama performances or sports activities, be encouraged? The key is to foster active participation and communal enjoyment, rather than passive consumption or degenerative activities like gambling. It also requires effort from intellectuals and authorities to guide and support these initiatives.\n\n**Kim Sangyong:** I agree with Mr. Yu. Reviving or adapting traditional forms might be one way. For example, *nongak* has a vibrant rhythm and communal spirit. Could it be modernized or simplified? Folk songs also hold artistic value. Perhaps collecting, arranging, and disseminating them could stimulate interest? Encouraging new creative activities based on local life, like simple plays or storytelling gatherings, might also be effective. Sports activities, if adapted to local conditions, could promote physical health and community bonding. However, these require conscious effort and resources. Simply lamenting the decline isn't enough.\n\n**Kim Munjip:** Promoting reading could also be considered a form of constructive entertainment. Providing access to books and encouraging reading habits could broaden perspectives and offer intellectual stimulation. Establishing simple libraries or reading rooms in villages could be a starting point. Also, regarding traditional forms, we need to be selective. Not all traditional entertainment is worth preserving. Some might be crude or promote undesirable values. We should focus on those with artistic merit and positive social functions. For example, mask dances often contained social satire and humor, which could still be relevant. *P'ansori* is a unique narrative art form. These could be adapted for modern audiences.\n\n**Pak T’aewŏn:** I think we need to be realistic. Grand initiatives might be difficult to implement immediately due to resource constraints and lack of personnel. Perhaps starting small is better. Encouraging existing positive activities, however simple, could be a first step. For example, if *yutnori* is still played, perhaps organizing small village tournaments could enhance its enjoyment and communal aspect. If people enjoy singing, perhaps organizing informal singing gatherings? The focus should be on fostering whatever positive local initiatives already exist or can be easily encouraged, rather than imposing external models. Also, addressing the root causes, such as economic hardship and lack of leisure time, is crucial, although that's a larger socio-economic issue.\n\n**Moderator:** Thank you all for your valuable insights. It seems clear that traditional local entertainment faces a severe crisis, largely replaced by gambling or passive consumption. While the reasons are complex, involving modernization, economic pressures, and changing lifestyles, there's a consensus on the need for constructive alternatives. Suggestions include selectively reviving and adapting valuable traditional forms like *nongak*, folk songs, or mask dances; promoting modern media like radio and movies in more active, communal ways; encouraging new creative activities like simple dramas or storytelling; promoting sports and reading; and fostering existing positive local activities. Implementing these requires conscious effort, resources, and support from both within and outside the communities. This is indeed a significant challenge for the future of local culture. We hope this discussion serves as a small step towards addressing this important issue.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis 1938 roundtable discussion addresses the decline of traditional Korean local entertainment (향토오락). Participants Kim Munjip, Kim Sangyong, Pak T'aewŏn, and Yu Chino, moderated by the magazine's editor, concur that forms like *nongak*, mask dances, *p'ansori*, and folk songs have largely vanished from rural life. They attribute this decline to the influx of modern civilization, economic hardship limiting leisure time, possible suppression by authorities, and fundamental changes in lifestyle and worldview. The void left by traditional entertainment is being filled primarily by gambling (like flower card games) and passive consumption of modern media such as radio and records. The participants suggest constructive alternatives like selectively reviving valuable traditional arts, encouraging active community engagement with modern media, promoting reading and sports, and fostering simple, locally-driven creative activities, while acknowledging the difficulty of implementing these solutions.\n\nFor historians, this article offers valuable insight into the cultural anxieties and transformations occurring in rural Korea during the late 1930s under Japanese rule. It reflects intellectuals' concerns about the erosion of traditional culture, the perceived lack of \"healthy\" entertainment for the masses, and the social problems associated with gambling. The discussion highlights the complex interplay between tradition and modernity, economic conditions, and cultural policy (implied through mentions of potential suppression and the need for guidance) in shaping everyday life during the colonial period. It also reveals contemporary perspectives on what constituted valuable cultural forms versus \"degenerative\" activities.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n향토\t향토\tLocal area / Native place\n김문집\t김문집\tKim Munjip\n김상용\t김상용\tKim Sangyong\n박태원\t박태원\tPak T'aewŏn\n유진오\t유진오\tYu Chino\n조선호텔\t조선호텔\tChōsen Hotel\n조선\t조선\tChosŏn (Korea)\n읍\t읍\tŬp (Town)\n\n**Glossary**\n\n향토오락\t향토오락\tLocal entertainment; entertainment of one's native place\n좌담회\t좌담회\tRoundtable discussion; symposium\n퇴락\t퇴락\tDecline; decay; deterioration\n세시풍속\t세시풍속\tSeasonal customs and practices throughout the year\n차전놀이\t차전놀이\tA traditional Korean game involving large wooden structures pushed against each other\n석전\t석전\tStone battle; a traditional (and often dangerous) team game involving throwing stones\n탈춤\t탈춤\tMask dance\n꼭둑각시놀음\t꼭둑각시놀음\tTraditional puppet play\n농악\t농악\tFarmers' music; traditional Korean folk music genre involving percussion, often accompanied by dance\n굿\t굿\tShamanistic ritual\n판소리\t판소리\tTraditional Korean narrative singing\n윷놀이\t윷놀이\tTraditional Korean board game played usually during holidays\n화투패\t화투패\tFlower cards (Hwatu/Hanafuda); often used for gambling\n노름\t노름\tGambling (older term, sometimes used more broadly for games/play)\n민요\t민요\tFolk song\n여가\t여가\tLeisure; spare time\n관헌\t관헌\tThe authorities; government officials\n유흥\t유흥\tEntertainment; amusement; pleasure\n라듸오\t라디오\tRadio (older phonetic transcription)\n레코-드\t레코드\tRecord (phonograph record) (older phonetic transcription)\n영화\t영화\tMovie; film\n풍미\t풍미\tTaste; flavor; charm; (in context) enjoyment or appreciation\n\n\n---------------------------","magazine":"『녹기』 (綠旗)","date":"February 10th, Shōwa 13 (1938)","title":"\"Arirang,\" Society, and Me"},{"path":"07_1930.07/220.txt","issue":"07_1930.07","content":"<32>\n\n**I. Where and How Many Reside**\n\nIt is truly difficult to provide an accurate number for our compatriots residing in China (支那), excluding Manchuria (満洲). There are no precise statistics available, and even if there were, the numbers fluctuate significantly day by day, making accuracy impossible. Consequently, estimates vary greatly depending on the source. The figure could be as low as one hundred thousand or as high as three hundred thousand. If we include Manchuria, the total number of our compatriots overseas reaches approximately two million, representing about one-tenth of the entire Korean population. Thus, the lives and activities of these overseas compatriots constitute a significant issue for the development of our Korean people. This article aims to provide a general overview (概況) of the situation of our compatriots residing in China proper, specifically excluding Manchuria.\n\nAlthough there are no accurate statistics, it is generally estimated that around two hundred thousand Koreans reside in various parts of China. They are most concentrated in North China (北支), particularly in cities like Peking (北京) and Tientsin (天津), and across Hopeh (河北) and Shantung (山東) provinces. Significant numbers are also found in Shanghai (上海) and other cities along the coast and the Yangtze River (揚子江), as well as in various inland locations. However, the largest population is undoubtedly concentrated in North China. This region serves as a gateway from Korea (朝鮮) and Manchuria, and due to its proximity and historical ties, it naturally attracts the largest number of Korean residents.\n\n**II. Types of Occupations and Living Standards**\n\nWhat kind of work do these compatriots engage in? Their occupations vary widely depending on the region. Generally, a large portion are involved in agriculture, especially in North China and Shantung Province. Others work as laborers, small-scale merchants, brokers, innkeepers, restaurant owners, cafe proprietors, and bar hostesses. There are also students, company employees, government officials, doctors, journalists, religious figures, and educators, among others. However, individuals in these latter, more specialized professions are relatively few. The vast majority are engaged in agriculture, manual labor, or small businesses.\n\nRegarding their living standards, it is generally quite poor (貧弱). Most live hand-to-mouth. Especially those engaged in agriculture in rural areas of North China and Shantung often face extreme hardship (苦痛). Farming conditions in China are harsh, and they frequently suffer from natural disasters like floods and droughts, as well as exploitation by landlords and officials, and threats from bandits. Many drift from place to place, unable to settle down. While those in cities like Peking, Tientsin, and Shanghai fare slightly better, most are still trapped in poverty. Small merchants lack capital, laborers face unemployment, and even those running eateries or inns struggle with intense competition. There are, of course, a few successful individuals, but they are exceptions. The overall living condition of Koreans in China is one of hardship and instability.\n\n<33>\n\n**III. Education and Cultural Life**\n\nThe educational situation for Koreans in China is extremely poor. There are very few dedicated educational facilities (施設) for Korean children. While some missionary schools or schools established by Korean organizations exist in major cities like Peking, Tientsin, and Shanghai, they are insufficient to accommodate the needs. Most children grow up without proper schooling. Illiteracy rates are high, and there is a general lack of knowledge and cultural awareness. This ignorance (無智) and lack of understanding (無理解) contribute to their difficulties in adapting to local society and improving their livelihoods.\n\nCultural life is similarly underdeveloped. Community organizations exist in some cities, but they often lack unity and financial resources. Newspapers or magazines published for Koreans are few and struggle to survive. Social gatherings or cultural events are infrequent. Many Koreans live isolated lives, detached from both Korean traditions and Chinese society. This lack of cultural connection and community support exacerbates their sense of alienation and hardship.\n\n**IV. Problems and Future Prospects**\n\nThe major problems facing Koreans in China are poverty, lack of education, poor sanitation, disunity, and discrimination. Poverty prevents them from improving their living conditions or providing education for their children. Lack of education hinders their ability to secure better jobs or participate effectively in society. Poor sanitation leads to health problems. Disunity among Koreans themselves weakens their ability to advocate for their collective interests. Furthermore, they often face prejudice and discrimination from the local Chinese population, as well as difficulties arising from their ambiguous legal status.\n\nAddressing these issues requires concerted effort from multiple fronts. There is a need for better support systems, including educational facilities, financial aid, and community centers. Promoting unity and cooperation among Koreans is crucial. Additionally, diplomatic efforts are needed to improve their legal standing and protect their rights. The future prospects for Koreans in China depend heavily on whether these challenges can be effectively tackled. Without significant improvements in their living conditions, education, and social integration, their struggles are likely to continue. The circumstances of our compatriots in China warrant serious attention and concern from both the homeland (内地) and the relevant authorities like the Government-General (総督府). Their situation is a special (特殊) one, demanding understanding and appropriate measures. The severity (甚) of their plight should not be underestimated.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis 1937 article by Yi Kaktchong describes the challenging living conditions of approximately 200,000 Koreans residing in China proper (excluding Manchuria), primarily concentrated in North China (Peking, Tientsin, Hopeh, Shantung). The author details their diverse but largely low-status occupations (farming, labor, small business), widespread poverty exacerbated by natural disasters and exploitation, extremely limited educational opportunities leading to high illiteracy, and underdeveloped cultural life marked by disunity and isolation. Key problems identified include poverty, lack of education, poor sanitation, internal disunity, and discrimination, requiring urgent attention and support systems. From a historical perspective, the article is significant as it provides a contemporary Korean viewpoint (published in a Japanese-controlled colonial era magazine) on the struggles of the Korean diaspora in China just before the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War. It highlights the socio-economic hardships, lack of infrastructure for diasporic communities, and the complex position of Koreans under Japanese colonial rule, caught between their homeland and host country, a situation requiring \"special\" attention from authorities like the Government-General. Historians might find the portrayal of Korean disunity and the call for intervention from colonial authorities particularly revealing of the period's complexities.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n支那\t지나\tChina\n満洲\t만주\tManchuria\n朝鮮\t조선\tKorea\n李覚鐘\t이각종\tYi Kaktchong\n北支\t북지\tNorth China\n北京\t북경\tPeking (Beijing)\n天津\t천진\tTientsin (Tianjin)\n河北\t하북\tHopeh\n山東\t산동\tShantung\n上海\t상해\tShanghai\n揚子江\t양자강\tYangtze River\n内地\t내지\tHomeland (here referring to mainland Japan or sometimes Korea itself in contrast to overseas)\n総督府\t총독부\tGovernment-General (of Korea)\n\n**Glossary**\n\n在支\t재지\tResiding in China\n同胞\t동포\tCompatriots; fellow countrymen\n〜올시다\t~올시다\tFormal declarative sentence ending (older form, equivalent to modern ~ㅂ니다/습니다)\n各地\t각지\tVarious places; each region\n概況\t개황\tGeneral situation; overview\n方面\t방면\tArea; region; field; aspect\n生活状態\t생활 상태\tLiving conditions; state of life\n苦痛\t고통\tSuffering; pain; distress; hardship\n貧弱\t빈약\tPoor; meager; scanty; inadequate\n施設\t시설\tFacilities; institution\n無智\t무지\tIgnorance; lack of knowledge\n無理解\t무리해\tLack of understanding\n特殊\t특수\tSpecial; particular; unique\n甚\t심히\t(Adverb form derived from 甚하다) Severely; extremely; intensely\n\n\n---------------------------","magazine":"『朝光』","date":"昭和十二年三月一日 (March 1, 1937)","title":"The Composition of Chunwon's (Lee Gwang-su) Seok-song Song and My Hardship"},{"path":"07_1930.07/230.txt","issue":"07_1930.07","content":"**Body Text Translation**\nThe path of our national liberation movement is indeed arduous and long. Reflecting on the past decade since the March First Movement, while the spirit of independence has permeated the entire nation, the concrete methods and strategies for achieving this goal still require deep consideration and unified action.\n\nSome advocate focusing solely on the cultivation of strength (實力養成), arguing that only through advancements in education, industry, and culture can we build the foundation necessary for eventual independence. They believe that direct confrontation without sufficient preparation is reckless and counterproductive. This perspective emphasizes patience, gradualism, and internal development as the primary means.\n\n<15>\n\nOthers, however, champion a more direct and active approach. They contend that relying solely on gradual self-strengthening under the oppressive conditions of colonial rule is naive. They argue that political struggle, raising international awareness, and mobilizing the masses for direct action, even if risky, are essential to challenge the colonial structure directly and hasten the arrival of liberation. Waiting passively for strength to accumulate, they fear, might mean waiting indefinitely while the national spirit erodes.\n\nUltimately, a dogmatic adherence to either extreme seems insufficient. The methodology of national liberation must be multifaceted. While the steady cultivation of national capabilities in all spheres – education, economy, culture – is undeniably crucial for long-term sustenance and future nation-building, we cannot neglect the political dimension. A flexible strategy is required, one that combines internal capacity building with astute political engagement and the mobilization of national consciousness, adapting tactics according to the changing domestic and international circumstances. The spirit of March First must guide us, but its methods must evolve with the times. We must seek a path that harmonizes inner strength with outward struggle.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis essay by An Chaehong discusses the ongoing debate regarding the best methods for achieving Korean national liberation from Japanese colonial rule. He contrasts the \"cultivation of strength\" (gradualist, focusing on internal development) approach with more direct political action and mobilization strategies. An concludes that neither extreme is sufficient alone, advocating for a multifaceted approach that combines internal capacity building with political struggle, adapting flexibly to circumstances. For historians, the article is significant as it reflects the internal strategic debates within the Korean nationalist movement during the colonial period, particularly the tension between cultural nationalism/gradualism and more activist approaches in the decade following the March First Movement.

On this occasion, as we send off the old year and greet the new, we have invited several critics who are active on the front lines of the literary world to freely share their thoughts in this roundtable discussion. We hope this will serve as a reference for readers interested in the ideological and literary circles. We ask each of you to first look back at the past year, Shōwa 11, and share your general overview. Let's start with Mr. Paek Ch'ŏl.\n\nPaek Ch'ŏl: Generally speaking about last year, Shōwa 11, what comes to mind first is that there were remarkably few works compared to previous years. It feels like it was a year of poor harvest in terms of literary works. Both full-length novels and short stories were scarce. This is just my general impression. Looking at the writers, there were hardly any new figures who emerged. Compared to Shōwa 10 (1935), there was very little activity from new writers last year. Among established writers, some individuals showed outstanding activity, but overall, the literary world felt stagnant.\n\nPak Yŏnghŭi: I generally agree with Mr. Paek's assessment. It seems last year was indeed a year of poor harvest. When we look back at the year, what should we consider? Should we look at the works produced, the activities of the writers, or the overall trends? If we talk about works, there really weren't many. For full-length novels, I can't think of any particular work that stands out from last year. There were some attempts, but nothing truly representative. As for short stories, while there might have been some good ones individually, overall, the quantity was small. If we consider the writers, as Mr. Paek mentioned, there were no notable new writers. Among the existing writers, Yi Hyosŏk (李孝石) and Kim Tongni (金東里) were perhaps the most active, but even their activity doesn't seem particularly outstanding compared to previous years. So, from the perspective of works and writers, last year was quite barren. However, if we look at the overall trend or atmosphere, there might be something to note.\n\nPak Nogap: My feeling is also that last year was generally inactive. Regarding the scarcity of works Mr. Paek and Mr. Pak mentioned, I wonder if it's related to the circumstances of the publishers or magazines. Weren't there fewer venues for publication? Also, perhaps the writers themselves were experiencing a period of introspection or transition? When looking back, it's easy to focus on the lack of output, but perhaps there were underlying shifts or preparations happening. For example, there seemed to be more theoretical discussions or debates, even if they didn't immediately lead to creative works.\n\nPak Ch'unsŏ: I also felt the stagnation last year. It seems the suppression (壓迫) from the authorities became stronger, making it difficult for writers to freely express themselves, especially regarding social or ideological issues. This might have contributed to the self-censorship or silence among writers. The topics became narrower, often focusing on personal experiences, nature, or aesthetics, avoiding direct engagement with social realities. This inevitably leads to a sense of limitation or lack of vitality in the literature produced.\n\nKim Namch'ŏn: Adding to what everyone has said, while the quantity might have been low, I think we should also look at the quality or the direction of the few works that did appear. Perhaps there was a deepening of psychological portrayal or experimentation with form, even within the constrained environment. I recall some works attempting new stylistic approaches. Also, the discussions around 'pure literature' (純粹文學) versus 'engaged literature' continued, although perhaps in a more subdued manner than before. The question of what literature can and should do under the current circumstances (時局) was an undercurrent. Looking back, Shōwa 11 might be seen as a year of internal searching and enduring hardship for the literary world, rather than outward achievement. What specific characteristics did you notice in the works that were published, Mr. Paek?\n\nPaek Ch'ŏl: As Mr. Pak Ch'unsŏ pointed out, there was a tendency to retreat into aestheticism or personal concerns. Some writers focused intensely on refining their style and exploring the beauty of the Korean language, which is valuable in itself. However, this often came at the expense of broader social relevance. There was also a sense of weariness or resignation in some works. But it wasn't entirely uniform; as Mr. Kim suggested, some writers, like perhaps Yi T'aejun (李泰俊) or Pak T'aewŏn (朴泰遠), continued their stylistic experiments, capturing the atmosphere of Kyŏngsŏng (京城) or delving into the inner lives of intellectuals, albeit within limits. <122> The lack of major, impactful works does stand out, though.\n\nPak Yŏnghŭi: Regarding the prospects for the new year, Shōwa 12 (1937), it's difficult to be optimistic given the trends of last year and the overall situation. Unless there's a significant change in the external environment, the constraints are likely to continue. However, writers are resilient. Perhaps the period of introspection will lead to new breakthroughs. We might see writers finding subtle ways to engage with reality, or perhaps a further deepening of artistic technique. The emergence of a truly powerful new voice would be welcome, but based on last year, it seems unlikely in the immediate future. Continued efforts in translation and introduction of foreign literature might also play a role in stimulating new ideas.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis roundtable discussion among Korean literary critics Paek Ch'ŏl, Pak Yŏnghŭi, Pak Nogap, Pak Ch'unsŏ, and Kim Namch'ŏn reflects on the state of Korean literature and ideology in 1936 (Shōwa 11) and looks ahead to 1937 (Shōwa 12). The participants generally agree that 1936 was a year of \"poor harvest\" with few significant literary works, especially full-length novels, and a lack of notable new writers. They attribute this stagnation to various factors, including increased censorship and suppression by Japanese authorities, a resulting tendency for writers to retreat into aestheticism or personal themes, potential difficulties with publishing venues, and possibly a period of internal searching or transition among writers themselves. While acknowledging some stylistic experimentation and the activity of certain established writers like Yi Hyosŏk and Kim Tongni, the overall assessment is one of limited vitality. Prospects for 1937 are viewed with caution, acknowledging the ongoing constraints but holding out hope for resilience and potential new developments born from the period of introspection.\n\nFrom the perspective of colonial history, this article is revealing about the chilling effect of Japanese colonial censorship on Korean cultural production in the mid-1930s. The critics' explicit mention of \"suppression (壓迫)\" and the resulting retreat from social engagement towards \"pure literature\" or personal themes underscores the difficult environment writers operated in. Historians can glean insights into the strategies of cultural survival and the internal debates within the Korean literary field under duress, as well as the specific writers and perceived trends of that year.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n思想文藝界\t사상문예계\tSasan·Munye'gye (Ideological and Literary Circles)\n朝鮮\t조선\tChosŏn (Korea)\n昭和\t쇼와\tShōwa (Japanese era name)\n白鐵\t백철\tPaek Ch'ŏl (Person)\n朴英熙\t박영희\tPak Yŏnghŭi (Person)\n朴魯甲\t박노갑\tPak Nogap (Person)\n朴春瑞\t박춘서\tPak Ch'unsŏ (Person)\n金南天\t김남천\tKim Namch'ŏn (Person)\n編輯部\t편집부\tP'yŏnjip-pu (Editorial Department)\n李孝石\t이효석\tYi Hyosŏk (Person)\n金東里\t김동리\tKim Tongni (Person)\n李泰俊\t이태준\tYi T'aejun (Person)\n朴泰遠\t박태원\tPak T'aewŏn (Person)\n京城\t경성\tKyŏngsŏng (Seoul)\n\n**Glossary**\n\n思想\t사상\tIdeology; thought\n文藝界\t문예계\tLiterary circles; the literary world\n回顧\t회고\tRetrospect; reflection on the past\n展望\t전망\tProspect; outlook for the future\n座談會\t좌담회\tRoundtable discussion; symposium\n昨年\t작년\tLast year\n一年 동안\t일 년 동안\tDuring one year; for a year\n編輯部\t편집부\tEditorial department\n記者\t기자\tReporter; journalist\n前線\t전선\tFront line\n各位\t각위\tEveryone; ladies and gentlemen (honorific)\n槪觀\t개관\tGeneral overview; outline\n一言\t일언\tOne word; a brief comment\n-ㅁ닛가\t-ㅂ니까\tInterrogative ending (formal, older form of -ㅂ니까?)\n-ㅁ닛다\t-ㅂ니다\tDeclarative ending (formal, older form of -ㅂ니다)\n듯십슴닛다\t듯싶습니다\tSeems like; appears to be (older form of 듯싶습니다)\n注目\t주목\tAttention; notice\n貧弱\t빈약\tPoor; meager; scanty\n長篇\t장편\tFull-length (novel)\n短篇\t단편\tShort story\n新進作家\t신진작가\tNew writer; emerging writer\n既成作家\t기성작가\tEstablished writer\n不振\t부진\tStagnation; slump; inactivity\n執筆\t집필\tWriting (literary work)\n壓迫\t압박\tPressure; oppression; suppression\n當局\t당국\tThe authorities\n純粹文學\t순수문학\tPure literature\n時局\t시국\tThe current situation; state of affairs\n內面的\t내면적\tInternal; inner; psychological\n文壇\t문단\tThe literary world; literary circles\n\n\n---------------------------","magazine":"朝光","date":"昭和十二年一月一日 (January 1, 1937)","title":"Returning from Tokyo for the Far Eastern Olympics"},{"path":"07_1930.07/250.txt","issue":"07_1930.07","content":"The Origin of Pen Names\n\nSiram Kwŏn Tong-jin\nI was originally called Udang (憂堂). Then, after serving a three-year sentence for the March 1st Movement and being released from prison, Son Ŭi-am (孫義庵) and several others from the Ch'ŏndogyo Church (天道敎會), who all used pen names ending with the character Am (庵), as well as Mr. O Se-ch'ang (奧世昌), suggested that I change my pen name too. I decided I wanted something substantial and to work practically, so I took the character *Sil* (實, meaning 'reality' or 'substance') and became Siram (實庵). I am also called Sirong (實翁). Even now, old acquaintances call me Udang or Siram, so I suppose I ultimately have three pen names.\n\nPongsan Yi Chong-nin\nPongsan (鳳山) comes from my hometown, Sŏsan in Ch'ungnam Province. In front of Sŏsan town (瑞山邑), there is a beautiful mountain peak called Ponghwangsan (鳳凰山). Although I left my hometown long ago due to worldly affairs and have wandered around, I can never forget the indescribable affection and nostalgic feeling (香味) for my hometown. To express this sentiment, I decided to take the mountain's name. However, I couldn't use all three characters, Ponghwangsan, so I removed the *Pong* (鳳) character and used Hwangsan (凰山). *Pong* refers to the male phoenix and *Hwang* to the female. While \"Pongsan\" might seem more correct, as stated in Lao Tzu's Theory of the Mysterious Female (玄牝說), the female is dynamic; though seemingly gentle on the surface (表面), she possesses a great power to embrace others. I chose this name when I was 15, attending a private village school for Classical Chinese (漢文私塾), and I have been using it for 34 years now.<55>\n<54-55>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis article features two prominent figures, Kwŏn Tong-jin and Yi Chong-nin, explaining the origins of their pen names (雅號, *ahŏ*). Kwŏn Tong-jin, an independence activist involved in the March 1st Movement, changed his name from Udang to Siram after imprisonment, reflecting a desire for practical action, influenced by fellow Ch'ŏndogyo members. Yi Chong-nin chose Pongsan (originally Hwangsan), derived from Ponghwangsan mountain near his hometown of Sŏsan, expressing deep nostalgia and drawing philosophical inspiration from Lao Tzu regarding the strength of the feminine principle. From a historical perspective, the article is interesting as it reveals the personal reflections and motivations of Korean intellectuals and activists during the colonial period. Their choices of pen names were deeply personal yet connected to significant events like the March 1st Movement, religious affiliations (Ch'ŏndogyo), philosophical thought (Lao Tzu), and a poignant sense of longing for their hometowns under Japanese rule, highlighting how identity formation was intertwined with national consciousness and resistance.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n實庵 權東鎭\t실암 권동진\tSiram Kwŏn Tong-jin\n憂堂\t우당\tUdang\n孫義庵\t손의암\tSon Ŭi-am\n天道敎會\t천도교회\tCh'ŏndogyohoe\n奧世昌\t오세창\tO Se-ch'ang\n實翁\t실옹\tSirong\n鳳山 李鍾麟\t봉산 이종린\tPongsan Yi Chong-nin\n忠南 瑞山\t충남 서산\tCh'ungnam Sŏsan\n瑞山邑\t서산읍\tSŏsan-ŭp\n鳳凰山\t봉황산\tPonghwangsan\n凰山\t황산\tHwangsan\n老子\t노자\tLao Tzu\n\n**Glossary**\n\n雅號\t아호\tPen name, literary name\n由來\t유래\tOrigin, history\n회고·수기\t회고·수기\tMemoir, reminiscence\n하엿다\t하였다\tDid (older spelling of 하였다)\n밋헤\t밑에\tUnder, below (older spelling of 밑에)\n갈나고\t갈라고 / 바꾸라고\tAsking to change (older form/spelling of 갈으라고 or 바꾸라고)\n實속잇게\t실속있게\tSubstantially, meaningfully, fruitfully (older spelling)\n舊知\t구지\tOld acquaintances\n불너주고\t불러주고\tCall (older spelling of 불러주고)\n前面\t전면\tFront side\n秀麗한\t수려한\tBeautiful, scenic\n世事\t세사\tWorldly affairs, life's affairs\n도라다닌지\t돌아다닌지\tSince wandering around (older spelling of 돌아다닌 지)\n愛慕\t애모\tAffection, deep love\n香味\t향미\tFlavor; here used metaphorically for nostalgic feeling/sentiment\n이즐\t잊을\tTo forget (older spelling of 잊을)\n떼어벅리고\t떼어버리고\tRemoving and discarding (older spelling/form of 떼어 버리고)\n숫컷\t수컷\tMale (animal) (older spelling)\n암컷\t암컷\tFemale (animal)\n긔왕이면\t기왕이면\tIf that's the case anyway, since it's already done (older spelling)\n올흔\t옳은\tCorrect, right (older spelling)\n갓트나\t같으나\tAlthough it seems like (older spelling of 같으나)\n玄牝說\t현빈설\tTheory of the Mysterious Female (from Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching)\n發動的\t발동적\tActive, dynamic, initiating\n表面\t표면\tSurface\n싸안는\t품는 / 싸안는\tEmbracing, enveloping\n漢文私塾\t한문 사숙\tPrivate village school teaching Classical Chinese texts\n폭\t폭\tApproximately, about (used with duration, extent)\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n잡지명\t삼천리 제7호\n발행일\t1930년 07월 01일\n기사제목\t雅號의 由來\n기사형태\t회고·수기\n\n雅號의 由來\n實庵 權東鎭\n나는 원래 憂堂이라 하엿다. 그러다가 3·1運動때 3년의 형을 치르고 출옥하자 孫義庵을 위시하야 天道敎會의 여러분들이 모다 庵字를 밋헤 두고 號를 지으며 奧世昌군 등이 작고 내 號도 갈나고 하기에 무에든지 實속잇게 또 실지로 일하여야 되겟다는 뜻으로 實字를 따다가 實庵이라하고 또 實翁이라고도 한다. 지금도 舊知들은 憂堂이라고도 불너주고 實庵이라고도 하여주니 결국 내 號는 3개라 할가.\n\n鳳山 李鍾麟\n鳳山이라 함은 나의 고향이 忠南 瑞山인데 瑞山邑의 前面에 鳳凰山이란 秀麗한 山嶽이 잇다. 비록 世事로 고향을 떠나 도라다닌지는 오래지만 고향에 대한 무에라 말할 수 업는 愛慕와 香味는 이즐 길이 업서서 그 심정을 표현하고저 그 山名을 따로 따다 쓰기로 하엿는데 그러타고 鳳凰山이라고 석자나 쓸 수 업서 鳳字를 떼어벅리고 凰山이라 하엿다. 鳳은 숫컷이고 凰은 암컷으로 긔왕이면 「鳳山」함이 올흔 것 갓트나 老子의 玄牝說에도 잇드시 암컷은 發動的이고 表面 順한 듯하나 남을 싸안는 힘이 위대한 바 잇다. 이 號가 漢文私塾 다니든 15세 당시의 지은 것이 벌서 34年을 써온 폭이 된다.＜55＞\n＜54-55＞","magazine":"삼천리 제7호","date":"1930년 07월 01일","title":"The Origin of Pen Names"},{"path":"07_1930.07/260.txt","issue":"07_1930.07","content":"**Body Text Translation:**\nLiterary Scene: News and Updates\n\nRegarding Posŏk Cho Myŏnghŭi (抱石 趙明熙), he is the one widely known to the world for his two works of the novel \"Naktonggang\" (洛東江).

Recent news indicates he is working as a school teacher in Vladivostok (海參威).\nAnyway, he is a man of substance, so it is pleasing that he is doing substantial work.\n\nMeanwhile, his daughter, whose father was sent abroad, is only 15 this year, but with a spirited mettle no less than her father's, she stepped onto the vocational front as a bus girl (뻐스껄) starting this spring.

He was thus detained for many days at the Kyŏnggi Provincial Police Department (京畿道警察部). At that time, through the negotiation of the newspaper company, he received writing paper and an iron pen (鐵筆) [stylus] and wrote five installments inside. This must be the first instance (矯矢) of a prison literary work (獄中 作品) in Korea.\n\nThe song \"Kangnamgok\" (江南曲), composed by Kayo Association member Sŏksong Kim Tongwŏn (石松 金烔元), was set to music by Ewha College (梨花專門) music professor An Kiyŏng (安基永), considering traditional folk song styles to bring out Korean sentiment. It has already been performed several times at concerts and is said to have garnered absolute high praise.<56>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis article provides updates on several figures associated with the Korean literary and cultural scene in 1930. It reports that novelist Cho Myŏnghŭi, known for \"Naktonggang,\" emigrated to Vladivostok and became a teacher after struggling financially in Korea. His young daughter began working as a bus girl. Former journalist Kim Myŏngsun is rumored to be pursuing an acting career in Japan. Writer Kong Myŏnghŭi (likely Hong Myŏnghŭi) continued writing installments of \"The Tale of Im Kkŏkchŏng\" while imprisoned by the Japanese police, marking a significant event in prison literature. Lastly, it notes the success of the song \"Kangnamgok\" by Kim Tongwŏn and composer An Kiyŏng, praised for its traditional Korean sentiment. From a historical perspective, the article reveals the precarious lives of intellectuals under colonial rule, showing emigration due to hardship (Cho), political imprisonment (Kong/Hong), the emergence of women in new professions (Cho's daughter, Kim), and efforts to maintain Korean cultural identity through music (Kim/An). The mention of Kong/Hong Myŏnghŭi writing *Im Kkŏkchŏng* in prison is particularly interesting for historians studying resistance and cultural production under duress.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n抱石 趙明熙\t포석 조명희\tPosŏk Cho Myŏnghŭi\n洛東江\t낙동강\tNaktonggang\n海參威\t해삼위\tHaesamwi (Vladivostok)\n趙君\t조군\tMr. Cho (Referring to Cho Myŏnghŭi)\n탄실 金明渟\t탄실 김명순\tT'ansil Kim Myŏngsun\n碧初 共命熹\t벽초 공명희\tPyŏkch'o Kong Myŏnghŭi [Note: Commonly known writer is 洪命熹 Hong Myŏnghŭi]\n朝鮮日報\t조선일보\tChosŏn Ilbo\n林巨正傳\t임거정전\tIm Kkŏkchŏng Chŏn\n京畿道警察部\t경기도경찰부\tKyŏnggido Kyŏngch'albu (Gyeonggi Provincial Police Department)\n石松 金烔元\t석송 김동원\tSŏksong Kim Tongwŏn\n江南曲\t강남곡\tKangnamgok\n梨花專門\t이화전문\tIhwa Chŏnmun (Ewha College)\n安基永\t안기영\tAn Kiyŏng\n\n**Glossary**\n\n文壇\t문단\tLiterary world, literary scene\n張三李四\t장삼이사\tZhang San Li Si (Chinese idiom); Tom, Dick, and Harry; Various people/figures\n널니\t널리\tWidely (Older spelling of 널리)\n알니든\t알리던\tWho made known (Older form of 알리던)\n팟죽\t팥죽\tRed bean porridge\n엇더케나마\t어떻게나마\tSomehow, in some way (Older spelling of 어떻게나마)\n안으니\t않으니\tBecause not (Older spelling/form of 않으니)\n漂然히\t표연히\tAbruptly, suddenly;飄然히 wanderingly\n로서아\t러시아\tRussia\n재작년\t재작년\tThe year before last\n그랫드니\t그랬더니\tIt was so, and then...

That is why, wherever there is a national flag, a resolute National Anthem constantly flows, always reawakening the patriotic spirit. Among them, this French National Anthem, \"La Marseillaise,\" is widely acknowledged to be peerless in the entire world for its lyrics, drawn from utmost devotion (至誠) to the fatherland, and its passionate (激越) melody that strikes the hearts of the entire nation.\n\nThe origin of this song dates back to the French Revolution era, specifically 1792, when Louis XVI declared war (宣戰 布告) on Austria <58> (墺太利). At that time, many volunteer soldiers were still needed for the defense (수비) of Strasbourg (스트와쓰, 부륵). Enraged by the draft dodgers (*兵忌避者) reluctant to go into battle, Captain Rouget de Lisle (도리-슬; Do. Lisle) of the Corps of Engineers, aiming to inspire their morale (志氣), immediately took up his pen and wrote this song. Composed by the bandmaster \"Mirou\" (*미루-), it was first sung in his barracks, then by the entire army, and eventually, it came to be cherished and sung by the entire populace.\n\nSince then, on national holidays (慶節) or memorial days (祭日), or during wars like the Great European War (歐洲大戰亂), the entire French nation has sung this song, rousing their own spirits (志氣).\n\nEven sitting here, tens of thousands of miles away, do we not feel boundless emotion just humming this song? Moreover, when one imagines French youth, dressed in Napoleonic style, singing this song while drumming and trumpeting, marching solemnly under the Arc de Triomphe (凱旋門) in Paris (巴里), one cannot suppress the boiling of the red blood dormant within one's body.\n\nIn 1915, during the Great European War, on the 120th anniversary of the death of the author \"Do. Lisle,\" the body of Lisle, beloved by the entire French nation, was, with national consent, reburied with a state funeral (國葬) next to the remains (遺骨) of Napoleon I (奈巴翁 1세) under the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. On this day, President Poincaré (포앙카제), the Allied Commander-in-Chief, tens of thousands of soldiers, and hundreds of thousands of citizens loudly sang (高唱) \"La Marseillaise\" while moving the great patriot \"Do. Lisle's\" body (移葬). Indeed, Carlyle (카라일), who wrote the history of the French Revolution, offered high praise (激讚):\n\"The Marseillaise was the finest song ever published. Its melody deeply stirred the blood in every man's veins and made the body tremble. The entire army and the entire nation weep and sing with burning passion. Furthermore, they sing this song with a spirit that treats 'death,' 'tyrants,' and 'devils' as nothing.\"\nAccording to an anecdote (談片) from Mr. Yi Chŏngsŏp (李晶燮), who was in Paris some years ago, once the song \"La Marseillaise\" broke out, all the citizens of Paris would become ecstatic (如狂如醉), shouting hurrahs (快呼) and singing along (和唱), seemingly having no greater effect in instantly uniting the nation and its people. <59>\n\nThe Watch on the Rhine (Germany)\n-Die Wacht am Rhein-\n\nVerse 1\n\nIs that resounding noise the sound of thunder?\nThe sound of swords and bayonets? The sound of waves?\nTo the Rhine, the Rhine, the German Rhine,\nWho is the guardian of this river?\n\n(Chorus)\nBeloved Fatherland, may you be calm!\nBeloved Fatherland, may you be calm!\nFirm and true stands the watch, the watch on the Rhine!\nFirm and true stands the watch, the watch on the Rhine! (Remaining 4 verses omitted - original text)\n\nThis is the national anthem, called Germany's \"Marseillaise,\" which well expresses the passionate fervor of the German people. It is said that this song, \"Die Wacht am Rhein,\" was written to counter the French \"Bekkel\" (벳켈) song, which started with the line \"We have obtained it, the German Rhine,\" resulting from the Prusso-French War (普佛戰爭), thereby inspiring the people's hostility (적개심) towards the enemy. The lyricist was a twenty-one-year-old manufacturer named Schneckenburger (슈넥캠북거-) who wrote it in 1840. Later, the German Emperor decided to grant the young man an annuity (年金) of 150 pounds (磅) annually until his death, but this genius unfortunately passed away (새상을 때나고) at the age of 30. There should be no need to further question how much this song encouraged (激勵) the morale (사기) of the German people during the European War. <60>\n\nFree Russia Has Come\n-(New National Anthem of Worker-Peasant Russia)-\n\nGreat Russia has appeared between Heaven and Earth,\nA powerful nation like an endless ocean.\nValiant are the heroes who cleared away the lingering mist.\nFree Russia has now finally come.\n\nGreat Russia has appeared between Heaven and Earth.\nAbove the mountains, rivers, seas, and fields,\nWe are free, we are happy.\nThe day begins to dawn before us.\n\nAfter the revolution, when discussions arose about revising the old Russian anthem that praised the Tsar (즈아), public opinion clamored to entrust this task to the poet of freedom, Mr. Balmont (바리몬도). At that time, the poet Mr. Balmont readily consented (快諾) and took up his pen to write this very song. The composer is the master of the music world, Mr. Gretchaninov (그레지아줍). As the translation is a re-translation (重譯) from Japanese, it doesn't seem very well done. It would be good just to grasp the general meaning (대의). Besides these, the anthems of various countries such as the USA (美國), UK (英國), Republic of China (中華民國), etc., will be continued in the next issue (來號).\n-1930, 5, 22- <61>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis article from the July 1930 issue of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine introduces the national anthems of France (\"La Marseillaise\"), Germany (\"Die Wacht am Rhein\"), and the new post-revolutionary Russia. It provides partial Korean translations of the lyrics and discusses the historical origins and emotional power of each anthem, highlighting how they galvanize national spirit and patriotism. The French anthem receives particular praise for its revolutionary fervor and ability to unify the nation, citing historical events and figures like Rouget de Lisle, Napoleon, Poincaré, and Carlyle. The German anthem is presented as a response to French sentiment after the Prusso-French war, and the Russian anthem reflects the political changes following the revolution. For colonial Korean historians, this article is interesting as it discusses potent symbols of national identity and unity (national anthems) from powerful foreign nations during a period when Korean national expression was suppressed. The strong emphasis on the revolutionary origins and unifying power of \"La Marseillaise,\" and the discussion of national spirit (志氣) and patriotism (애국적 정신), could be interpreted as an indirect way to foster or discuss similar sentiments among Korean readers, using European examples as a seemingly neutral subject.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n佛蘭西\t불란서\tFrance\n獨逸\t독일\tGermany\n露西亞\t로서아\tRussia\n파인\t파인\tP'ain\nLa Morreillaise\t라 마르세예즈\tLa Marseillaise\n루이 16세\t루이 16세\tLouis XVI\n墺太利\t오태리\tAustria\n스트와쓰, 부륵\t스트라스부르\tStrasbourg\n도리-슬\t도리슬\tDo.

It is truly a pleasant thing to be completely alone, trudging through a place others have not ventured. Feeling quite like a primitive man, with each step I take, it seems as though a tiger or a camel might leap out from this forest.\n\nAfter walking for some time, a hillock appeared, and on that hillock, a shepherd was reading something. A young man.—For some reason, feeling a sense of affection (親愛), I tossed out a word, like passing the Buddha's birthday in early April.\n\n\"What are you sitting and reading?\"<57>\n\nHe silently held out the book. I looked; it was Turgenev's (트루게넵) \"Fathers and Sons\" (父와 子).\n\n\"So, you can read this book?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"Where did the book come from?\"\n\n\"From the library of the All-Russian Union of Agricultural and Forestry Workers (全露農林勞働同盟).\"\n\n\"So, you've joined it?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"As a shepherd?\"\n\n\"I'm a shepherd in the summer and a university student in the winter. Though I may look like this, I finished the Branch of the People's Commissariat for Education (國民敎育部支部) and came here to study physics and chemistry.\"\n\nI shook his hand warmly. When I realized the shepherd was a seasonal worker and, like me, a member of the Union of Agricultural and Forestry Workers (農林勞働同盟員), I was exceedingly glad.\n\nJune 26th\nToday on the school grounds (校庭), I asked a fellow female university student (女子大學生), \"Tobina-,\"\n\n\"Do you know what kind of thoughts women had and how they lived before the revolution (革命)?\"\n\nShe smiled sweetly and said,\n\n\"Do you even know what the revolution gave us women? It was truly amazing. In the past, for hundreds, no, thousands of years, women were entirely materially (物質的) dependent on men. As if bound by chains, they leaned on men's arms. Then, suddenly, we became free (自由). Free bodies. But conversely, I know very well how men—the most active (活動)<58> men—view young women. First, they embrace you, then live together (仝捿) for about a week, and then just abandon you. I know it all.\"\n\nI was surprised,\n\"Who says such things? How could that be?\"\n\n\"What do you mean, you know it all too. I know from seeing what happens to my friends. When that happens, the formerly pure girls have no choice but to get an abortion (墮胎) or give birth to the child. Then the men act as if to say 'I am not that child's father,' holding their heads high under the clear blue sky (靑天白天).\"\n\n\"But what then? What about that maidenly purity!\"\n\n\"Lies! You answer first. If you were to love a woman who knew a man for the first time versus one who knew a second, where would your heart go?\"\n\n\"It would be the same, of course.\"\n\n\"Lies! But fine. Now the problem isn't in such relationships between the sexes (兩性), but in something beyond (以上) that. We women must quickly become engineers (技師), ship captains (船長), and workers (勞働者). That is bigger. That is more urgent. We have been liberated (解放).\"\n\nSaying this, she laughed cheerfully (快活) and ran off towards the Medical Faculty (醫學部). For some reason, I felt cheerful.\n\nJanuary 1st\nLast night, I attended the funeral (葬式) of a famous poet (有名한 詩人). Somehow, a desolate (寂寞) feeling fills my heart.

He recounts encounters reflecting Soviet life: meeting a shepherd who is also a university student and member of a workers' union, highlighting educational opportunities for laborers; and a conversation with a female student, \"Tobina-,\" who discusses the newfound freedom and opportunities for women post-revolution (like pursuing careers as engineers or captains) while also frankly addressing the continued challenges in relationships with men, including abandonment and the hypocrisy surrounding female purity. The entries convey an admiration for the social changes under the Soviet system, particularly regarding workers' education and women's liberation. For historians, this text offers a rare glimpse into how a Korean individual perceived and interpreted the Soviet experiment during the colonial period, reflecting contemporary leftist interest in the USSR as a model for social change, especially concerning class and gender equality, themes highly relevant to colonial Korea's own struggles. The frank discussion of gender dynamics provides insight into evolving views on women's roles and sexuality among progressive circles.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n露國\t노국\tRussia\n莫斯科\t모스크바\tMosk'wa (Moscow)\n요-그리\t요그리\tYo-gŭri\n트루게넵\t트루게네프\tT'urugenyep'ŭ (Turgenev)\n全露農林勞働同盟\t전로농림노동동맹\tChŏllo Nongnim Nodong Tongmaeng (All-Russian Union of Agricultural and Forestry Workers)\n國民敎育部支部\t국민교육부지부\tKungmin Kyoyukpu Chibu (Branch of the People's Commissariat for Education)\n도비나-\t도비나\tTobina-\n\n**Glossary**\n\n쏘비엣\t소비에트\tSoviet (Older transliteration)\n共産大學生\t공산대학생\tCommunist university student\n露國\t노국\tRussia (Archaic term)\n大學生\t대학생\tUniversity student\n手記\t수기\tRecord, memoir\n森林\t삼림\tForest\n거러 간다\t걸어간다\tWalks (Older spelling of 걸어)\n아조\t아주\tVery, completely (Older spelling)\n갓치\t같이\tLike, as (Older spelling)\n든덕\t둔덕\tHillock, mound\n닑고\t읽고\tReading (Older spelling of 읽고)\n물논\t물론\tOf course (Older spelling)\n어듸서\t어디서\tFrom where (Older spelling)\n녀름\t여름\tSummer (Older spelling)\n드겁게\t뜨겁게\tWarmly, fervently (Older spelling)\n알엇슬\t알았을\tKnew, realized (Older spelling)\n깁부엇다\t기뻤다\tWas glad/happy (Older spelling)\n校庭\t교정\tSchool grounds, campus\n女子大學生\t여자대학생\tFemale university student\n녀자\t여자\tWoman (Older spelling)\n사러와는지\t살아왔는지\tHow (they) lived (Older spelling/form)\n엇뎐\t어떤\tWhat kind of (Older spelling)\n혁명\t혁명\tRevolution\n物質的\t물질적\tMaterially\n지대여\t기대어\tLeaning on (Older spelling/form)\n엇더케\t어떻게\tHow (Older spelling)\n仝捿\t동서\tLiving together (Archaic Hanja term)\n墮胎\t타태\tAbortion\n아해\t아이\tChild (Older form/dialectal)\n그제\t그제야\tOnly then, thereupon\n両性\t양성\tBoth sexes, gender\n技師\t기사\tEngineer\n船長\t선장\tShip captain\n勞働者\t노동자\tWorker, laborer\n해방\t해방\tLiberation, emancipation\n우스며\t웃으며\tSmiling, laughing (Older spelling)\n잇는대로\t있는대로\tTowards where (something) is\n有名\t유명\tFamous\n詩人\t시인\tPoet\n葬式\t장식\tFuneral\n단녀왓다\t다녀왔다\tAttended, went and came back (Older spelling)\n寂寞\t적막\tDesolation, solitude, silence\n드러찬다\t들어찬다\tFills up (Older spelling)\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n잡지명\t삼천리 제7호\n발행일\t1930년 07월 01일\n기사제목\t쏘비엣 共産大學生生活,\n필자\t露國 莫斯科 大學生 요-그리 手記\n기사형태\t회고·수기\n\n쏘비엣 共産大學生生活,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t露國 莫斯科 大學生 요-그리 手記\n6월 20일\n나는 혼자 森林 속을 거러 간다. 아조 혼자되어 남이 가보지 못하든 곳을 터벅터벅 거러가는 것은 실로 유쾌한 노릇이다. 아조 내가 원시인이 되어 한 발자곡씩 옴길 때마다 이 삼림 속으로부터 범이나 낙타가튼 것이 뛰어나올 것 갓치 생각된다.\n한참 가다보니 든덕이 나지고 그 든덕에는 목동이 무엇을 읽고 잇다. 젊은 청년이다.-엇전지 親愛하는 생각이서 말 한 마듸 사월 초파일 둥 넘어가듯 보내어 보앗다.\n「자네는 무얼 닑고 안젓나.」＜57＞\n그는 말업시 책을 쑥 내민다. 보니 트루게넵의 「父와 子」\n「그래 이 책을 볼 줄 아나.」\n「물논일세.」\n「어듸서 책은 나왓나?」\n「全露農林勞働同盟의 도서관에서 일세.」\n「그래 거기 가입하엿나.」\n「물론일세.」\n「목동으로?」\n「녀름에는 목동이고 겨울에는 대학생이라네. 이러케 보여도 國民敎育部支部를 마치고 물리와 화학을 배우려 온 것이라네.」\n나는 그와 드겁게 악수하엿다. 목동은 계절 노동자라 그도 나와 갓튼 農林勞働同盟員임을 알엇슬 때에 한끗 깁부엇다.\n\n6월 26일\n나는 오늘 校庭에서 가튼 女子大學生 「도비나-」더러\n「혁명 전의 녀자들이 엇뎐 생각을 가지고 사러와는지 아우?」\n그는 생긋 웃고는\n「혁명이 우리들 여자에게 무엇을 주엇는지 당신을 알기나 하우?

The \"Tobacco Ballad's\" dialogue format, questioning why tobacco came to Chosŏn, might subtly reflect contemporary sentiments about foreign introductions or influences. The preservation of regional songs like \"Nyŏngbyŏn Ka\" and specific song types like \"Menari\" provides insight into local traditions and the Korean language (including older spellings) used at the time, offering linguistic and cultural data for historians studying colonial Korea.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n갈미봉\t갈미봉\tKalmibong\n동래\t동래\tTongnae\n울산\t울산\tUlsan\n조선\t조선\tChosŏn\n강남\t강남\tKangnam\n영변\t영변\tNyŏngbyŏn\n동대\t동대\tTongdae\n\n**Glossary**\n\n륙자박이\t육자배기\tA type of traditional Korean folk song with a six-beat rhythm, originating from the southwestern provinces.

In one's honest feelings, one wants one's own creative work to receive praise, while pointing out flaws in others' works without mercy. To hear that one has done wrong, and even while knowing perfectly well that the words are right, to dislike it and want to retort somehow, yet to want to point out others' flaws without the slightest mercy—this might be called human nature. However, for those whose thoughts and feelings are as keen as literary figures, this tendency is even stronger. Yet, with the virtues of self-reflection, tolerance, and clarity, one should be able to escape from this so-called childish psychology to some extent. What writers find most unpleasant and dissatisfying, even among bad reviews, is when they are emotional, mistaken, based on insufficient understanding, or endlessly impressionistic. When even bad reviews stemming from so-called ideological differences or seen through the colored glasses of prejudice devolve into empty slander, there is nothing more foul for the writer, and nothing more poisonous to the path of literature. As is often said, for the individual, it is easy to fall into personal attacks, and for the path of literature, it easily hinders proper development and public enlightenment.\n\nHowever, truthfully, I have never felt much pain or become particularly enraged even when receiving bad reviews for my works up until now.\nThis is not because I am that tolerant or disregard the reviews and reviewers, but because they were not fair critical writings that hit the mark. For me, no matter how harsh the criticism, if it is a just review, like a sharp needle striking the vital point<62> head-on, I would gladly submit, not only for self-reflection and training but also for the sheer refreshing taste of it. Rather, I would want to look up to such a person as a true friend (知己). It is difficult to receive such a just review. Conversely, no matter how favorable the review, undeserved excessive praise and flattery are by no means appreciated. In the end, one desires a proper understander—someone who knows me (知我者).\nRecently, in a certain daily newspaper, the review of \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" (西部戰線異狀업다) by the English General Hamilton (한밀톤) and the moved response by its author Remarque (레마루케) is a good example of how a work can forge a true friendship (知己之友) through criticism. But can we find such criticism in our literary circles?\nThere are many cases where my works are groundlessly slandered, whether out of jealousy regarding the so-called decline of the established literary circle (though in reality, there has been no decline, fall, or corruption) or through a self-serving attitude (我田引水的) as a measure to defend proletarian literature. However, in reality, it is merely laughable, and I do not enjoy refuting them.\nIf they were to thoroughly dissect my work with a sharp scalpel using a scientific approach, cornering me without any room for rebuttal, I would want to express a word of gratitude, saying it was refreshing. But mostly, after loud shouting and clamoring, the content is ultimately empty and lacks substance worth acknowledging. In that case, wouldn't it perhaps be wiser to just quietly walk my own path?\n\nFurthermore, criticism does not only deal with the individual author. As long as a work possesses sociality, it is natural that criticism addresses society, or more narrowly, the readership. Therefore, criticism can be called an instructive act that satisfies the readers' intellectual demand regarding literature. The aesthetic feeling given by the work itself merely appeals to the reader's emotion; the intellectual demand to know good from bad, right from wrong, must await criticism. That is, the influence given by the work is an unconscious osmotic process (滲透作用), but criticism responds to conscious absorption and is a literary effort that has the effect of stimulating and awakening this. Therefore, criticism must be most fair, not only to guide literature itself onto the right path but also to fulfill the mission of social enlightenment that literature affects. Thus, if one gets caught up in petty feelings between the established and the newcomers or parochial factional subjectivism (派閥的 小主觀) and mistakes the incidental for the essential, one should be ashamed not only by artistic conscience but also by partisan, social, and even human conscience.\nFinally, one more word: some people's critical attitude or sentiment varies one way or another depending on personal closeness or distance, but this too is something to be cautious about.\nThis is merely a brief statement of my thoughts while observing the current state of the critical arena. (End) <63>\n\nRelationship Between Writers and Critics\nCh'oe Haksong\n\nThe issue is too awkward to take up the pen for. As someone who has, for better or worse, drafted and published several short stories in the past, speaking now about the various literary critics who have cast favorable or unfavorable reviews upon my works is undeniably quite a painful task. Therefore, I will jot down just a few extremely fragmented and rambling thoughts here and thus escape this difficult obligation.\n\nThe first time I received literary criticism from critics was probably for the short stories published in \"Chosŏn Mundan\" (조선문단), such as \"13 Wŏn\" (13圓), \"T'alch'ulgi\" (脫出記), and \"Kia wa Sallyuk\" (饑餓와 殺戮). Some may remember those days, but it was decided to hold a joint review meeting (合評會) gathering all the works published in the literary circle that month and critique them there. Thus, among those who spoke about my works, I recall P'albong (八峯), Pak Wŏlt'an (朴月灘), Na Tohyang (羅稻香), Yŏm Sangsŏp (廉想涉), and Hyŏn Chin'gŏn (玄鎭健)氏. Among them, there were those who offered insightful opinions that made me indeed bow my head and listen attentively, but I also saw some who misunderstood my work and, ignoring even the slightest hints that might have flowed between the lines (紙背), offered only superficial criticism.\nAt that time, since it was the first time hearing public opinion (世評) about my own creative work, I felt my heart pounding with shyness and surprise. Indeed, what points others criticized and what points they praised, how they observed my descriptive techniques, my way of viewing events, and the movement of the theme—these occupied my mind entirely with interest.\n\nSince then, I have heard various people offer kind critiques of my works through writing and speech. Among them, the various criticisms thrown by P'albong Kim Ki-jin (金基鎭) showed many points worth acknowledging and offered many suggestions for my path of creation. However, within Kim-kun's reviews, there were instances where he simply remained silent (緘口) or casually glossed over even unremarkable works about which I myself had no confidence. Regarding this, I complained<64> that it would have been more appropriate to offer much rebuke or scolding.\nIn any case, among the ten or so works I have written in the past, whether I had confidence in them or not, the one that received the worst reviews was \"Chŏn'gi\" (轉機). I remained silent about this at the time, and I have decided to remain silent about it until now. For reasons I have in mind.\n\nNow, as a matter of obligation, I am in a position where I must write a concluding remark on how I view critics, but as I said earlier, I dislike talking about this issue. However, I might be able to say this one thing.\nAs a writer, listening to appropriate criticism from a critic is extremely pleasant and encouraging, but when the critic is an insignificant figure, it is natural to let it pass like the east wind to a horse's ear (馬耳東風), like a distant village dog's bark (遠村犬吠). In short, ignore them. One thing to add here is that a fair review, kind criticism, absolutely does not mean pointing out only the strengths of the work, of course. <65>\n\n**Summary**\n\nYŏm Sangsŏp and Ch'oe Haksong discuss the complex relationship between writers and literary critics in 1930s Korea. Yŏm Sangsŏp argues for the necessity of fair, insightful, and objective criticism, free from personal bias, ideological prejudice (mentioning the conflict with Proletarian Literature proponents), or superficiality. He values criticism that hits the mark (\"頂門의 一箴\") and sees the ideal critic as a true intellectual friend (\"知己\"), citing the example of Remarque and his reviewer. Ch'oe Haksong shares his personal experiences, acknowledging the value of constructive criticism (particularly from Kim Ki-jin) in his development but expressing frustration with misunderstanding or overly lenient reviews, and advocating for ignoring criticism from unqualified figures. Both authors highlight the emotional impact of reviews but ultimately seek criticism that contributes meaningfully to the writer's growth and the health of literature. From a historical perspective, these articles reveal the intense debates within the colonial Korean literary scene, touching upon ideological clashes (Established vs. Proletarian), the function of criticism in shaping literary direction and public understanding, and the writers' vulnerability and resilience amidst critical evaluation. The reference to Remarque shows an awareness of international literary discourse.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n廉想涉\t염상섭\tYŏm Sangsŏp\n한밀톤\t한밀톤\tHamilton\n레마루케\t레마르크\tRemarque\n西部戰線異狀업다\t서부전선 이상 없다\tSŏbu Chŏnsŏn Isang Ŏpta (All Quiet on the Western Front)\n崔鶴松\t최학송\tCh'oe Haksong\n조선문단\t조선문단\tChosŏn Mundan\n13圓\t13원\t13 Wŏn\n脫出記\t탈출기\tT'alch'ulgi\n饑餓와 殺戮\t기아와 살륙\tKia wa Sallyuk\n八峯\t팔봉\tP'albong (pen name of Kim Ki-jin)\n朴月灘\t박월탄\tPak Wŏlt'an (pen name of Pak Yŏnghŭi)\n羅稻香\t나도향\tNa Tohyang\n玄鎭健\t현진건\tHyŏn Chin'gŏn\n金基鎭\t김기진\tKim Ki-jin\n轉機\t전기\tChŏn'gi\n\n**Glossary**\n\n밧고\t받고\treceiving (older spelling)\n십흐면서\t싶으면서\twanting to (older spelling)\n업시\t없이\twithout (older spelling)\n잇서서는\t있어서는\tin the case of (older spelling)\n잇스면\t있으면\tif there is (older spelling)\n버서\t벗어\tescape from, take off (older spelling)\n늣기는\t느끼는\tfeeling (older spelling)\n가튼\t같은\tsame, like (older spelling)\n업슬\t없을\twill not be (older spelling)\n듯고\t듣고\thearing (older spelling)\n올흔\t옳은\tright, correct (older spelling)\n실혀하고\t싫어하고\tdisliking (older spelling)\n조곰도\t조금도\teven a little bit (older spelling)\n밧는다\t받는다\treceive (older spelling)\n눗긴\t느낀\tfelt (older spelling)\n업거니와\t없거니와\tnot only... but also (older spelling)\n쩍도\t적도\toccasion, time (older spelling)\n어든\t얻은\tobtained, hit (the mark) (older spelling)\n가덕\t같은\tlike, same as (older spelling/dialectal)\n십흔\t싶은\twanting to (older spelling)\n엇기는\t얻기는\tobtaining (older spelling)\n아무러한\t아무러한/아무런\tany kind of\n어더볼\t얻어볼\tto obtain and see (older spelling)\n엇저니\t어쩌니\tsaying this or that (older spelling)\n거나하야\t거나하여\tor, either... or (older conjunctive form)\n만흐나\t많으나\talthough many/much (older spelling)\n안는다\t않는다\tdo not (older spelling)\n너흔다면\t넣는다면\tif put in (older spelling, here context suggests 'cornering')\n십호련만은\t싶으련만은\twould want to, but...

One day around 5:30 AM, he alighted at the train station. It was still night. The surroundings were enveloped in darkness, and the crowing of roosters, urging the sun to rise, mingled loudly. At the rural train station, besides a few inn touts soliciting guests, no human figures could be seen. He looked around as if he had forgotten something, and he also looked out onto the road in front of the station as if waiting for someone.\n\nWhile he was doing this, raindrops began to fall. No, the dawn rain poured down like a squall. He seemed at a loss for what to do. However, soon, as if having made some decision, he turned up the collar of his spring coat, pulled his hat down low, and darted off like an arrow onto the main road leading north.\n\nIf anyone at that time had found this young man's behavior suspicious and followed him, they would have discovered that he did not go from the station into the town center, but rather passed through the new road (新作路) leading south of the town center and continued walking south, ever south. The rain still poured. Ah, who is this young man, enduring the rain at this dawn hour, avoiding inhabited areas, and where is he going? <65>\n\nBrother P'a In (巴人兄). You can probably guess who this young man is, right? And you surely know where this train station is, right?\n\nWhen the waters rise in the Kŭm River (錦江) and reeds grow thick on the banks, the croaker boats, fully loaded, return from the Ch'ilsan (七山) sea. Hoisting yellow and blue flags high on their masts, beating drums and singing songs, kicking up the golden sunset glow in the western sky, with sails half-slanted catching the strong \"dragon head\" wind, hundreds of croaker boats in one tide – the croaker boats that used to build the livelihood of this port. The smell permeates every street. Flies are everywhere. Amidst this, there was abundance. Ah, this place, my hometown of old.\n\nI long to see the old man who used to fish below Ilkamjŏng (一鑑亭) Rock Wall, where colorful clouds gather on Ongnyŏbong (玉女峰) Peak, and the grounds where Uam (尤奄) and Sagye (砂溪) used to play at P'algwaejŏng (八卦亭) and Imnijŏng (臨履亭). What were those clams we gathered, fighting and quarreling, the gang of naked children playing on the white sandy beach? Getting our heels bitten by mudskippers, getting our faces cut by reed leaves (갈ㅅ닙), unaware of the incoming tide, searching for the nests of reed warblers – what has become of those friends from that time? On the Great Full Moon day of the New Year, flying away the misfortune-averting kite, skipping evening meals to run along the paddy ridges, playing jwibulnori (쥐볼놋튼) – that bygone era, ah, my hometown from when I was far, far away in childhood!\n\nBrother P'a In, the young man walks on. As if having forgotten the falling rain, he walks very slowly, head bowed. The town he passed through is where his ancestors lived before him, the place where his life first fell upon the mat; in old terms, Hwangsan (黃山). The station he alighted at dawn is Kanggyŏng (江景), past Nonsan (論山) where the Ŭnjin Mirŭk (恩津彌勒) stands, possessing plains famous as a grain region. But now, he hates even setting foot here. Rather than him hating it, it is his hometown that does not accept him.\n\nWhy would that be? He does not care to explain the reason. He merely cries out thus:\n\n\"Where has the nest gone?\nThe little bird wanders.\nWhere is my hometown?\nThis heart wanders.\nThe landscape has turned into an empty husk (통);\nWhat use is there in seeking it?\" <66>\n<65-66>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe article, written in a melancholic and nostalgic tone, describes a young man returning to his hometown, Kanggyŏng, early one morning. Instead of entering the town, he walks away into the rain, feeling alienated and rejected by the place of his birth. He reminisces vividly about the lively past—the bustling port filled with fishing boats, childhood games with friends on the banks of the Kŭmgang River, and historical landmarks. This contrasts sharply with his current feeling of loss and the sense that his hometown, and perhaps the entire landscape (\"강산\"), has fundamentally changed and become an \"empty husk,\" making his return meaningless. From a historical perspective, the piece reflects the profound sense of displacement, alienation, and loss experienced by some Koreans during the colonial period. The mention of a \"new road\" (新作路) and the train station points to modernization under Japanese rule, which altered familiar landscapes. Historians might find the article's depiction of the psychological impact of these changes—the feeling of being rejected by one's own radically altered homeland—particularly interesting as a personal reflection of broader societal shifts and the complex relationship between identity, memory, and place under colonial modernity.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n江景\t강경\tKanggyŏng\n金石松\t김석송\tKim Sŏk-song\n巴人兄\t파인형\tP'a In hyŏng\n錦江\t금강\tKŭmgang\n七山\t칠산\tCh'ilsan\n玉女峰\t옥녀봉\tOngnyŏbong\n八卦亭\t팔괘정\tP'algwaejŏng\n臨履亭\t임리정\tImnijŏng\n尤奄\t우암\tUam\n砂溪\t사계\tSagye\n一鑑亭\t일감정\tIlkamjŏng\n黃山\t황산\tHwangsan\n恩津彌勒\t은진미륵\tŬnjin Mirŭk\n論山\t논산\tNonsan\n\n**Glossary**\n\n정차장\t정차장\tTrain station (Older term for 기차역)\n나리엇다\t내리었다\tGot off; descended (Older spelling/form of 내렸다)\n아즉도\t아직도\tStill; yet (Older spelling)\n우름\t울음\tCrying; weeping (Sound) (Older spelling)\n중놈\t중놈\tInn tout; servant (Possibly derogatory, older term)\n몃\t몇\tA few; several (Older spelling)\n밧게\t밖에\tOnly; outside of (Older spelling)\n업다\t없다\tTo not exist; to lack (Older spelling)\n이저바린\t잊어버린\tForgotten (Older spelling/form of 잊은)\n기달이 잇는\t기다리고 있는\tWaiting (Older spelling/form of 기다리고)\n내어다 보다\t내다 보다\tTo look out at (Older form)\n갓티\t같이\tLike; as (Older spelling)\n떠러지기\t떨어지기\tFalling (Older spelling)\n엇절줄\t어쩔 줄\tWhat to do (Older spelling/contraction)\n한드시\t한 듯이\tAs if having done something (Older spelling)\n깃올\t깃을\tCollar (Object particle usage)\n울이고\t올리고\tRaising; turning up (Older spelling)\n뚤닌\t뚫린\tOpened; pierced through (Older spelling)\n길노\t길로\tTo the road (Particle usage)\n쏜살갓티\t쏜살같이\tLike an arrow (Older spelling)\n녁이어\t여기어\tConsidering; thinking (Older spelling/form of 여겨)\n하엿슬\t하였을\tWould have done (Older spelling/form of 하였을)\n마지며\t맞으며\tBeing hit by (rain); facing (Older spelling)\n어대로\t어디로\tTo where (Older spelling)\n것인고\t것인고\tWhat is it?

Although there was a period of 7 or 8 years from my cradle days through childhood when I went down to the countryside near P'yŏngyang, for the most part, I lived longest in P'yŏngyang. <66> However, since entering my youth, I have wandered abroad, so I don't know if I can call myself a pure P'yŏngyang person, but it is a fact that my hometown is in P'yŏngyang. That is why even when weaving lonely dreams by a cold window in the north wind, the P'yŏngyang Taedong River would float like a phantom.\n\nPeople yearn for their hometown throughout their lives. Don't they say that even if Lapps, who lived in gravesites (塋穴) in the North Sea (北洋), are relocated to mild Southern Europe, they sink into even deeper homesickness as the wind and snow worsen? How much more so for P'yŏngyang, a beautiful waterside town (水鄕) where the mountains are bright and the water is beautiful (山明水麗), could one forget the longing for home?\n\nIndeed, P'yŏngyang is beautiful. Where Kŭmsu Mountain ripples, the P'aesu River (浿水) winds around like silk. If you look down from Moran Peak onto the vast, flowing river (溶溶한 長江) on a day bathed in the slanting evening sun, and if there is even a single tune from a reed pipe (一曲笙歌) at night, what more could one want in the world (天下事)?\n\nAs the landscape features mountains behind and water blocking the front (負山阻水), overlooking a vast plain from afar (遠臨曠野), the people's spirit is broad-minded (闊達). Also, because conflicts (于戈) with the powerful neighbors to the north (北隣請强) were ceaseless, their temperament is profound, brave, heroic, and strong (沈勇雄强), exhibiting the true character (本色) of the remaining people of Koguryŏ (高句麗遺民). Therefore, great generals (雄將) like Ŭlchi Mundŏk and renowned officials (名官) like Kang Kamch'an emerged in the past, as well as loyal and honest strongmen (忠直한 力士) like Ondal. However, on the other hand, being too strong in self-assertion (自我) can lead to showing a tinge of arrogance (驕), and there is a sense that the spirit of harmony (協和의 精神) is lacking.\n\nThe mountains and rivers of P'yŏngan Province are majestic, but those of P'yŏngyang possess a delicate beauty (纖美), having a feminine charm. Therefore, there are also figures famous for feminine cunning (女性的 狡猾); contrasting with the simple and honest Sŏk Ondal, figures like the modern famous Pongi Kim Sŏndal type (鳳伊 金先達類) are also numerous (허다하다).\n\nP'yŏngyang's rivers and mountains are clear like a bright mirror (明鏡), without any cloudy spots. Therefore, people's character is also naturally clear, and they are not adept at secret schemes (은밀한 謀計). When angered, they fight even if it means breaking their heads, and when happy, they rejoice to the point of pouring out their insides. As they originally revered martial valor (武勇), their customs are simple and honest (淳厚), and one can infer a glimpse (一端) of this by looking at their clothing, food, and general etiquette (衣食凡節).\n\nP'yŏngyang people are frugal (儉朴) but cannot save wealth (貯蓄치 못한다). It is said this is because the lay of the mountains and rivers (山川의 形勢) makes it so, and they naturally become this way due to its vital energy (精氣). Even while earning money wearing hemp clothes (수목 - 樹木 likely means 삼베옷/hemp clothes here) and eating barley rice (조밥), they spend it all in one evening of boating parties (배노리) on the Taedong River. They work well, but they also play well. Therefore, it is said there are no wealthy families (富豪) lasting three generations here. This is one aspect of the spirit (氣魄) of people raised in the P'yŏngyang landscape. Though it's not a good thing (좃치 못한 일이지만).\n\nTheir habitual strong courage (强勇) is evident not only in fighting with fists and heads but is strong in other ways too; that strong courage has made them rich in enterprising spirit (進取性). Thus, they were also the bravest in first adopting the influx (流入) of new civilization (新文明). This might be a reaction (反動) to the oppression (抑壓) of the 500 years of the Yi Dynasty (李朝)!\n\nP'yŏngyang soldiers (兵丁) and kisaeng (기생) are famous. Soldiers are famous for fighting well and being brave; kisaeng are famous because even amidst their fallen lives (淪落한 生涯), they are self-fulfilled (自我充實). Kisaeng are certainly a natural product (自然的 生産) of P'yŏngyang's landscape, viewed from a negative (醜的) aspect.\n\nThere are times when trouble arises because of stubborn courage (剛勇). The stubborn courage of a foolish (미욱한) person might not be entirely without merit, but the stubborn courage mixed with cunning intelligence (奸智) creates abuses (弊端). Therefore, while there are many figures like An To-san (安島山), there are also people like a certain Sŏn Kan (鮮干某). In this way, the P'yŏngyang landscape pushes the character of the people it embraces to two extremes (極端). <67>\n\n**Summary**\n\nKim Tong-jin, a P'yŏngyang native writing in 1930, describes his hometown as a place of outstanding natural beauty, linking the landscape of the Taedong River basin to the character of its people, seen as descendants of Koguryŏ. He portrays P'yŏngyang people as brave, frank, broad-minded, and spirited, but also impulsive, prone to arrogance, lacking unity, poor at saving money due to a love for enjoyment, yet possessing an enterprising spirit quick to adopt new things. He mentions historical figures like Ŭlchi Mundŏk and Ondal as exemplars of positive traits, contrasts Ondal with the cunning Kim Sŏndal type, and notes the fame of P'yŏngyang soldiers and kisaeng, framing the latter as a 'natural product' of the region. The article concludes by observing that the P'yŏngyang environment fosters character traits pushed to extremes, producing both admirable figures like An To-san (An Ch'ang-ho) and problematic ones. From a historical perspective, the article is interesting for its articulation of regional identity and stereotypes during the colonial period, reflecting on historical legacies (Koguryŏ, Yi Dynasty oppression) to explain contemporary traits. The blend of pride and criticism, and the specific archetypes mentioned (heroic general, loyal strongman, trickster, soldier, kisaeng), offer insight into how Koreans viewed themselves and their regional differences under Japanese rule, particularly regarding modernization ('new civilization').\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n平壤\t평양\tP'yŏngyang\n高句麗\t고구려\tKoguryŏ\n金東進\t김동진\tKim Tong-jin\n大洞江\t대동강\tTaedong River\n錦繡山\t금수산\tKŭmsu Mountain\n浿水\t패수\tP'aesu\n모란 峯\t모란봉\tMoran Peak\n乙支文德\t을지문덕\tŬlchi Mundŏk\n姜邯贊\t강감찬\tKang Kamch'an\n溫達\t온달\tOndal\n石溫達\t석온달\tSŏk Ondal\n鳳伊 金先達\t봉이 김선달\tPongi Kim Sŏndal\n安島山\t안도산\tAn To-san\n鮮干某\t선간모\tSŏn Kan-mo\n李朝\t이조\tYi Dynasty\n\n**Glossary**\n\n搖籃時代\t요람 시대\tCradle days, infancy\n낙향\t낙향\tReturning to the countryside\n流離\t유리\tWandering, drifting (often as a refugee or exile)\n朔風寒窓\t삭풍한창\tNorth wind at a cold window (evokes loneliness)\n單夢\t단몽\tLonely dream\n幻影\t환영\tPhantom, illusion\n山明水麗\t산명수려\tMountains are bright and water is beautiful (describes scenic beauty)\n水鄕\t수향\tWaterside town, area with many rivers/lakes\n늠실거린\t늠실거리는\tRippling, undulating (older verb form)\n감돌고\t감돌고\tWinding around, flowing around\n斜陽\t사양\tSetting sun, evening sun\n溶溶한\t용용한\tVast and flowing (describing a river)\n一曲笙歌\t일곡생가\tA tune from a reed pipe/mouth organ\n形勝\t형승\tScenic beauty, strategic topography\n負山阻水\t배산조수\tMountains behind and water blocking the front (topographical term, similar to 背山臨水)\n遠臨曠野\t원림광야\tOverlooking a vast plain from afar\n기개\t기개\tSpirit, mettle, disposition\n闊達\t활달\tBroad-minded, magnanimous, cheerful\n于戈\t우과\tWeapons, conflict, war (literary term)\n沈勇雄强\t침용웅강\tProfound, brave, heroic, and strong\n遺民\t유민\tRemaining people (of a fallen dynasty/state)\n본색\t본색\tTrue character, original colour\n雄將\t웅장\tGreat general, hero\n名官\t명관\tRenowned official\n忠直\t충직\tLoyal and honest\n力士\t역사\tStrongman\n自我\t자아\tSelf, ego\n驕\t교\tArrogant, proud\n協和\t협화\tHarmony, concord\n결핍\t결핍\tLack, deficiency, shortage\n纖美\t섬미\tDelicate beauty\n狡猾\t교활\tCunning, sly (reconstructed from 狡*)\n우직한\t우직한\tSimple and honest, artless, naive\n근세\t근세\tModern times, recent ages\n허다하다\t허다하다\tTo be numerous, many\n明鏡\t명경\tBright mirror\n은밀한\t은밀한\tSecret, covert\n謀計\t모계\tScheme, plot, stratagem\n長하지 못하다\t장하지 못하다\tNot be good at, not excel in\n淳厚\t순후\tSimple and honest, unaffected and gentle\n衣食凡節\t의식범절\tClothing, food, and general etiquette/manners\n一端\t일단\tOne end, a part, a glimpse\n儉朴\t검박\tFrugal, thrifty, simple\n저축치\t저축지\tSaving (wealth) (older form of 저축하지)\n形勢\t형세\tConfiguration, lay (of the land), situation\n精氣\t정기\tVital energy, spirit, essence\n수목\t수목\tTrees, woods (likely used here to mean 삼베옷 -

Although countless theories of art and literature have existed up to now, it is because there have been few modern bourgeois critics who have clearly shown us, in a true sense, what art is.\nLiterary critics of the 18th or 19th centuries made this \"art\" into a kind of sacred idol, and accordingly, they understood their duty as theorizing that their sacred art was isolated from the reality of human society. Art critics possessing feudal or capitalist consciousness, lacking a definition derived from the life of humanity like this, had various kinds of art theories, all of which were a form of idealism.\n\n2\nIf we speak of art or artistic works, the scope is vast. For example, we can think of things like poetry, novels, plays, fine art, film, and so on.\nThen, what are these artistic works, such as a piece of poetry or a painting? What significance do they hold for our lives?\nWe will investigate this once more.\n\n3\nWhat is art? Why write a poem, why paint a picture? What relation does it have to our lives? And furthermore, why does the proletariat try to possess its own art?\nTo explain this, I intend to state, most simply, some definitions from new and old critics.\nThe 18th-century French literary critic Brunetière (삐네트 - Ppinet'ŭ) said that \"literature refers to all writings through which humans attempt to express themselves comprehensively to other humans.\" Also, the same Posnett (뽀스네트 - Pposŭnet'ŭ) said, \"Literature is the expression in which thought is written through imagination, emotion, and taste,\"<68> but there is an unclear contradiction within this. An artistic work strikes the emotions before appealing to the intellect of the reader who reads the work. It infects the sentiments. Therefore, \"expressing oneself to others\" or expressing one's \"thought to others\" can be done even if it is not an artistic work; this expression of one's thought can be a political argument, it can be a philosophical treatise, and it can also be done through fervent oratory. However, \"art,\" unlike all the means discussed above, is not expressed merely from intellect to intellect, but is transmitted solely from emotion to emotion; that is, the expression of \"one's thought\" is a means within the realm of art to connect this emotion and feeling—sentiment. Art is a perfect and noble means of connecting emotion and emotion. Therefore, Leo Tolstoy (레오, 틀스토이 - Reo, T'ŭlsŭt'oi), in his treatise on art \"What is Art?\", rightly said, \"Art is that which infects with emotion—feeling.\"\n\n4\nIf, then, the definition of art is to transmit this \"one's thought\" or \"one's expression\" through emotional means—art—that is, to infect another person's feelings with one's own feelings, what is this \"self\" that forms the content of this art, this \"one's thought\" or \"one's expression\"?\nIt goes without saying that this \"self\" does not refer to the egoistic individual that individualists assert. That is unspeakable. The \"self\" which is the core constituting an artistic work is decidedly not the \"self\" of Robinson (로빈손 - Robinson) stranded on a desert island. It is the consciousness stimulated in one's own individual self acquired within a society, that is, social consciousness. Since art is not for enjoying alone but for infecting the emotions of others, it must encounter the social consciousness that the general public empathizes with. Just as the elder said, \"Perfect individualism is not realized when an individual is alone, but can only be realized amidst the multitude,\" the more artistic a work is, the more it infects the emotions of others, the more the \"self\" seeking expression within the work increasingly acquires social significance, and accordingly, \"self\" becomes synonymous with \"social significance.\"\n\"Why can't the Miser (守錢奴 - Such'ŏnno) sing about his lost money? It's very simple.—Even if he were to sing about his loss, his song could not move anyone. In other words, it is because it is useless as a means between him and other people,\" as Plekhanov (뿌레하노프 - Ppŭrehanop'ŭ) rightly stated. (Remainder omitted - original text)\n\n**Account of Accompanying the Royal Visit to the Tombs in Hamhŭng**\nBy Yi Sanghyŏp (Using pseudonym 何夢 - Hamong)\n\nThis trip to Hamhŭng, as the word \"accompanying\" (陪行 - paehaeng) implies, was already passive, and furthermore, arose suddenly, so setting aside the geography of the Northern Frontier (北關 - Pukkwan) and the history of T'aejo, I could not even peruse a single volume of the Kwanbuk Chŏllŭngji (關北殿陵誌 - Records of Palaces and Tombs in the Kwanbuk Region), which should be the foundation of this travelogue, thus feeling almost as if standing on the battlefront empty-handed. (Omitted - original text)\n\nWhenever the train traversed the main road and passed through stations, officials and civilians forming lines for respectful greetings and send-offs (祗迎祗送 - chiyŏng chisong) formed [*crowds]. Without even the leisure to appreciate the fresh green of Choyosan Mountain (趙遙山 - Choyosan), up to Yŏnch'ŏn Station (漣川驛 - Yŏnch'ŏnnyŏk), I only watched the crowds along the route with wonder. The inside of the train was rather tedious. On a long train journey, watching the turnover of passengers, with new ones getting off at this station and others getting on at that station, is no small diversion, but on this special train where others were forbidden to board or alight, even after traveling several hundred *ri* through mountains and rivers, from Nammun Station (南門驛 - Nammunyŏk) onwards, there were only familiar faces, and not a single new face could be seen.\n\nSoaring past Sep'o Station (洗浦驛 - Sep'oyŏk) at an altitude of 2,000 *ch'ŏk*, and entering the treacherous terrain of Sambang (三防 - Sambang), the magnificent scenery gradually heightened. The overlapping peaks wore snow and [missing character], and [missing character] clouds even brought [missing character] rain, making the entire view nothing but majestic. From Sambang [missing character] onwards, it was entirely a world of [missing character]. The crisscrossing mountains and waters increased in marvelous variation, and each time the long snake-like train entered and exited light and shadow like a nimble dragon, adding wonder upon wonder to the scenery, enchanting the mind of the first-time traveler. (Omitted - original text)\n\nChen Longchuan's (陳龍川 - Chin Yongch'ŏn) assessment of Jingkou (京口 - Kyŏnggu), \"Wine can be drunk, troops can be used\" (酒可飮, 兵可用), can be directly applied to Wŏnsan (元山 - Wŏnsan). Today, it is a fortified zone, and the fact that troops can be used speaks for itself, but those who appreciate the superb scenery of Myŏngsa Simni (明沙十里 - Ten *Ri* of Bright Sands) and the grand view of Yŏnghŭng [missing character] cannot help but be stirred to empty great cups of wine.\n\nOn the 11th, departing Wŏnsan at 9 a.m., we traveled by rail to Yŏnghŭng (永興 - Yŏnghŭng) and from there by automobile for 130 *ri* [missing characters], arriving in Hamhŭng (咸興 - Hamhŭng). The number of people who [missing characters] along the road hoping to glimpse the royal palanquin (弇駕 - yŏmga) was staggeringly large. And their perception of the automobile as something novel was beyond imagination.\n\nOn the 12th, amidst a drizzling spring rain (春雨 濛濛 - ch'unu mongmong), taking advantage of the leisure afforded by the postponement of the main palace ancestral rite (本宮親祭 - Pon'gung ch'inje), I climbed Pallyongsan Mountain (蟠龍山 - Pallyongsan) behind Sŏnhwadang Hall (宣化堂 - Sŏnhwadang). From the mountain [missing character], I looked up in reverence at the old site of Madai (馬臺 - Madae), a relic of T'aejo, and then turned my eyes down towards the Sŏngch'ŏn'gang River ([*川]江 - Sŏngch'ŏn'gang). The Mansedaegyo Bridge (萬歲巨橋 - Mansedaegyo) was faintly visible through the clouds [missing character], and the old willows along the long embankment (長堤老柳 - changje noryu) were eye-catching branch by branch. Standing amidst the rain, facing the mountain and overlooking the stream (背山臨流 - paesan imnyu), the traveler felt a secret joy, like a figure in a painting. Gazing up at the mountain, one might mourn its spirit; [missing character] the water, one might scoop its clarity. The charming mountains and waters were as beautiful as ever, but what did Chirakchŏng Pavilion (知樂亭 - Chirakchŏng) know? Nangminnu Pavilion (樂民樓 - Nangminnu) stood empty.\n\nThe 13th was clear (快晴 - kwaech'ŏng). The Hamhŭng Main Palace Ancestral Rite was solemnly performed from the afternoon according to ancient rituals (古儀式 - koŭisik). The main palace was surrounded on all sides by vast fields of wheat (萬頃麥田 - man'gyŏng maekchŏn), the yellowing heads of grain seeming to sway in the spring breeze. The elders and Confucian scholars (父老儒生 - puro yusaeng) gathered, dressed in black hats, white robes, felt hats, and round-collared coats (黑巾白袍紛帽團領 - hŭkkŏn paekp'o punmo Tallyŏng), looked as if the time before the Kabo Reforms (甲午 - Kabo, 1894) had returned. Their appearance, puffing out their chests (雙*을 掀하는 모양), was both laughable and pitiful. <69>\n\n**Condolence Poem for Wŏllam**\nBy Yun Ch'iho\n\nLonely is the Hansan moon (寂寞韓山月)\nMaster, you have gone and not returned (先生去不歸)\nThe eighty years of storms have ceased (八十風浪息)\nYour fragrant name shines with the sun (芳名與日輝)\n\n**The Historical Position of Women and Their Current Tasks**\nBy Hŏ Chŏngsuk\n\n1\nWhen reflecting on women's past historically, it is a historical fact that women were placed in an unequal position economically, politically, and in all social [missing characters], and suffered (**) under the double shackles of the patriarchal family (宗庭 - chongjŏng) and society. It is also a fact that in reality, they still have not escaped all these unfavorable fetters (覇絆 - p'aban) nor broken free from all those shackles.\nThis historical reality is the common situation of women worldwide, and the struggle to be liberated from these shackles is surely also the same.\nAs history entered the era of civilization, women's status began to decline. Just as the superstructure of society—that is, politics, law, education, morality, and all institutions—changes according to transformations in the economic structure, the changes in women's status also, in fact, originated from changes in the economic organization. As such, the inferiorization (劣等化 - yŏltŭnghwa) of women's status was not a mere accidental fact<63> but a fact due to historical necessity. Therefore, the women's movement for resolution must also be determined by historical necessity.\nIt has already been three centuries since women first cried out the sound (呱呱의 聲 - kwagwaŭi sŏng) of sexual liberation, and today, when partial or even complete resolution has been seen in some parts, the liberation movement of women in Chosŏn (朝鮮 - Chosŏn), one of the underdeveloped countries, is a movement lagging behind everyone else's.\nIt has already been over ten years since women's movements aiming for the liberation of Chosŏn women arose directly and indirectly, and it has been three years since the Kŭnuhoe (槿友會 - Kŭnuhoe) was born, aiming for the mass unity of women from all strata.\nCompared to past movements being [XXXXX XXXXX], the mission of the Kŭnuhoe, which emerged with the goal of women's mass participation, is the key (鍵 - kŏn) to liberating all women of Chosŏn from all past historical shackles, and the torch (炬火 - kŏhwa) to awaken Chosŏn women to [XX] consciousness and guide them towards a collective movement.\nRegarding the Kŭnuhoe movement, which emerged with such a great purpose and important role, we must establish policies based on reality with cool reason and a clear mind, and define [XXXXX].\n\n2\nLooking back at women's past historically (溯及하야 - sogŭphaya), women are not inherently inferior beings with fundamental differences from men.\nIn the past, women were equal human beings, in no way inferior to men in terms of intelligence, physique, social status, or political rights. There was only a sexual distinction between men and women due to natural functional differences; they were not in a position of discrimination regarding human rights or personhood. This can be known through the research of anthropologists, biologists, and others.\nThen, where did the cause lie for women, who held a position equal to men without fixed discrimination, to fall into the subordinate life they lead today<64>, lagging behind men in all social conditions?\nHistory proves that the constituent element of all organizations in human society, regardless of era or society, is the economic organization, which serves as its driving force, and at the same time, dependent on the changes in that economic organization, the external forms of that society—that is, the various constructs of culture—are transformed (*換).\nThe economic organization of human society has undergone many changes over a long period, and simultaneously, the forms of human life have also changed in diverse ways (多種多*).\nExamining the process of economic change, we can distinguish the primitive [XX] communal era, the slave era, the serfdom/feudal era, and the capitalist era.\nThese various systems (*度) that express the economic organization show the forms of the developmental process; in terms of their substance, there are two major property systems: one is collective communism (集體共産制 - chiptan kongsan'je), and the second is the individualistic and egoistic private property system (私有財産制度 - sayujaesanjedo).\nUpon these two property systems, various economic organizations were constructed, and various social cultures became established.\nThen, when was the era of productivity where women had no difference whatsoever in social or any other rights? It was the former [collective communism]. It was only from the transformation of the property system to the latter [private property], concurrent with the change in its governing principles (其役法 - kiyŏkpŏp), that all conditions disadvantageous to women began to arise.\n[XX] society gave women equal rights as equal producers, but the private property system transformed women into production laborers, simultaneously stripping women of human rights and personhood, and began treating them inhumanely as the private possessions of men, domestic slaves, and playthings (玩弄物 - wannongmul).\nIt was from this time that women began to receive treatment as half-humans (半人間 - panin'gan) who did not possess complete social human rights, and they consequently suffered the loss<65> of all social status and education. Thereafter, with the development of the private property system, women only fell further into the pit of decline, and restoration (複舊 - pokku) to their former status did not occur because, as written above, there was no fundamental transformation of the economic cause. (Remainder omitted - original text)<66>\n\n**New Literature of Russia**\nBy Kim Myŏngsik\n\n1\nDostoevsky (또쓰또에프쓰키 - Ttosŭttoep'ŭsŭk'i) was someone who, even before the fierce industrial revolution occurred in Russia (露西亞 - Nosia), early on depicted the scenes of the slums (貧民屈 - pinmin'gul) in the cities and preached the gospel of life for the urban poor. He was one who deeply discerned the fundamental sensitivities of life flowing from the depths of the human heart. This power of discernment purified his sorrow and caused him to hold a lifelong, pure affection for all suffering humans. His masterpiece is the novel called \"Crime and Punishment\" (죄와 벌 - Choe wa pŏl). What is particularly poignant when reading this novel is what the protagonist, Raskolnikov (라쓰콜니코 - Rasŭk'olnik'o), says, kneeling before the secret prostitute Sonya (소니야 - Soniya). \"I am not kneeling before you; I am kneeling before all suffering people.\" These words truly welled up from his own heart. And the words spoken by Elder Zosima (두시마 - Tusima) to Alyosha (아료사 - Aryosa) in the book \"The Brothers Karamazov\" (카라마*프 형제 - K'aramajop'ŭ Hyŏngje) are worth remembering even more. \"Humble love is a more fearsome power than violent deeds. Love people. Do not hate their sins, but love them even amidst their sins.\" Besides this, there is the book called \"Poor Folk\" (가난한 사람에게 - Kananhan saram ege), which, as one can guess from the title, also came from a loving sorrow for the masses. All his works are words of the gospel expressing such great love. Reading his works, we can vividly grasp the state of the soul hidden within the hearts of Russian people at that time<66> and discover the secrets lying at the very bottom. And one can see how much strength his broad love gave to the masses. When he passed away in 1881, the mournful sorrow (哀切 - aech'ŏl) and loving respect of men and women, old and young, from all classes converged upon his single person, making his funeral as grandly conducted as that of a great emperor or a great hero. From this alone, one can roughly tell how the masses of that time revered him and what kind of strength he gave to the masses.\n\n2\nGorky (고리키 - Korik'i) was a person born during Russia's industrial revolution era. This man fought (*) for the working class that emerged due to the industrial revolution at that time. Among modern Russian literary giants, there were not a few who fought for the masses, but it seems there was likely no one who fought, spewing forth such bold and fervent flames (氣熖 - kiyŏm), as he did. While deeply hating the capitalism that rapidly developed due to the industrial revolution, he simultaneously felt extreme sympathy for the miserable suffering of the workers' lives, which were rapidly increasing. No, the lukewarm (徹溫的 - ch'ŏrondŏk) word \"sympathy\" is hardly adequate to describe the fervent spirit with which he spewed flames for the so-called lowest class. Just as he himself confessed, \"From the bottom of life, where there is nothing but the mood of mire and shadow, I am the voice of a reliable human. I am the voice that cries out the suffering of those who still live there now,\" he was entirely a spokesperson (代言者 - taebyŏnja) for the bottom class (奧底階級 - okchŏ kyegŭp). He argued that the morality of the poor was not the fault of the poor themselves but entirely the fault of society, and launched fierce attacks against the social organization of that era. He especially detested (切憎之 - ch'ŏlchŭngji) the rampancy (跋* - parhwal) of capitalists and rebuked their immorality with all manner of fervent rhetoric. He went so far as to state vehemently that capitalists build not humans, but prisons (牢獄 - nogok).<67>\n<63-69>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis collection, \"The Scent of Famous Writings,\" presents a diverse range of literary pieces from 1930 reflecting the intellectual landscape of colonial Korea. It includes a Hanja poem of condolence likely for an independence activist (No Paengnin), a Marxist-influenced essay defining art's social function and criticizing bourgeois aesthetics (Pak Yŏnghŭi), a detailed travelogue describing a journey accompanying the former royalty to ancestral tombs in Hamhŭng (Yi Sanghyŏp), a brief elegy for the respected figure Yi Sangjae (Yun Ch'iho), a socialist-feminist analysis of women's historical oppression rooted in private property and advocating for the Kŭnuhoe movement (Hŏ Chŏngsuk), and an appreciation of Russian writers Dostoevsky and Gorky as champions of the suffering masses (Kim Myŏngsik). The pieces collectively reveal a strong engagement with social issues, class consciousness, nationalism (often implicitly), the women's question, and the influence of foreign ideologies like Marxism and Russian literature among Korean intellectuals navigating the constraints and realities of the Japanese colonial period. Historians might find Yi Sanghyŏp's account particularly interesting for its depiction of the symbolic but politically neutralized status of the former Yi monarchy under Japanese rule, as well as the explicit discussions of Marxist theory in art and feminism by Pak Yŏnghŭi and Hŏ Chŏngsuk, showcasing the active intellectual currents of the era.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n盧伯麟\t노백린\tNo Paengnin\n李甲\t이갑\tYi Kap\n半島江山\t반도강산\tPando Kangsan (Korean Peninsula)\n北滿洲\t북만주\tPuk Manju (North Manchuria)\n朴英熙\t박영희\tPak Yŏnghŭi\n佛國\t불국\tPulguk (France)\n삐네트\t삐네트\tPpinet'ŭ (Brunetière)\n뽀스네트\t뽀스네트\tPposŭnet'ŭ (Posnett)\n레오, 틀스토이\t레오, 톨스토이\tReo, T'olsŭt'oi (Leo Tolstoy)\n로빈손\t로빈손\tRobinson\n뿌레하노프\t플레하노프\tPpŭrehanop'ŭ (Plekhanov)\n李相協\t이상협\tYi Sanghyŏp\n何夢\t하몽\tHamong (Pseudonym for Yi Sanghyŏp)\n咸興\t함흥\tHamhŭng\n北關\t북관\tPukkwan (Northern Frontier region, Hamgyŏng Province)\n關北殿陵誌\t관북전릉지\tKwanbuk Chŏllŭngji\n趙遙山\t조요산\tChoyosan\n漣川驛\t연천역\tYŏnch'ŏnnyŏk (Yeoncheon Station)\n南門驛\t남문역\tNammunyŏk (South Gate Station)\n洗浦驛\t세포역\tSep'oyŏk (Sepo Station)\n三防\t삼방\tSambang\n陳龍川\t진룡천\tChin Yongch'ŏn (Chen Longchuan)\n京口\t경구\tKyŏnggu (Jingkou)\n元山\t원산\tWŏnsan\n明沙十里\t명사십리\tMyŏngsa Simni\n永興\t영흥\tYŏnghŭng\n蟠龍山\t반룡산\tPallyongsan\n宣化堂\t선화당\tSŏnhwadang\n馬臺\t마대\tMadae\n[*川]江\t성천강\tSŏngch'ŏn'gang (Seongcheon River - assumed based on location)\n萬歲巨橋\t만세거교\tMansedaegyo (Manse Bridge)\n知樂亭\t지락정\tChirakchŏng\n樂民樓\t낙민루\tNangminnu\n尹致昊\t윤치호\tYun Ch'iho\n月南\t월남\tWŏllam (Pen name, likely Yi Sangjae)\n韓山\t한산\tHansan\n許貞琡\t허정숙\tHŏ Chŏngsuk\n朝鮮\t조선\tChosŏn (Korea)\n槿友會\t근우회\tKŭnuhoe\n金明植\t김명식\tKim Myŏngsik\n또쓰또에프쓰키\t도스토옙스키\tTtosŭttoep'ŭsŭk'i (Dostoevsky)\n露西亞\t노서아\tNosia (Russia - older transliteration)\n죄와 벌\t죄와 벌\tChoe wa pŏl (Crime and Punishment)\n라쓰콜니코\t라스콜니코프\tRasŭk'olnik'o (Raskolnikov)\n소니야\t소냐\tSoniya (Sonya)\n카라마*프 형제\t카라마조프 형제\tK'aramajop'ŭ Hyŏngje (The Brothers Karamazov - '조' missing)\n두시마\t조시마\tTusima (Zosima)\n아료사\t알료샤\tAryosa (Alyosha)\n가난한 사람에게\t가난한 사람들\tKananhan saram ege (Poor Folk - title slightly different from modern standard)\n고리키\t고리키\tKorik'i (Gorky)\n\n**Glossary**\n\n尙今것\t상금껏\tUp until now (older form of 지금껏 - chigŭmkŏt)\n뿌르조아\t부르주아\tBourgeois (loanword)\n갓치\t같이\tLike, as (older spelling of 같이 - kach'i)\n解得\t해득\tUnderstanding, comprehension\n업슬까\t없을까\tWill there not be? / Is there not?

무수한 문학론이 잇기는 하엿스나 진실한 의미에서 우리들에게 예술이란 엇더한 것이라고 명시하여 준 현대의 뿌르조아 평론가로는 적엇든 까닭이다.\n18세기나 혹은 19세기의 문예비평가들은 이 『예술』이라는 것을 일종의 신성한 우상으로 만들엇스며 따러서 그들의 이 신성한 예술은 인간사회의 현실과 격리되여 잇는 것을 이론화하는 것으로써 그들의 임무로 알엇다. 봉건적 의식과 혹은 자본주의적 의식을 가진 예술비평가들이 이와 갓치 인생의 생활 속에서 解得한 定義를 갓지 못하고 그들의 예술론은 일종의 관념론이면서도 각양각색이엿다.\n\n2\n예술 혹은 예술적 작품이라면 그 범위가 광대하다. 예를 든다면 시, 소설, 희곡, 미술, 영화, 등의 것을 우리는 생각할 수 잇는 것이다.\n그러면 이러한 예술적 작품 즉 한 편의 시라든지 한 폭의 회화는 무엇인가? 그것은 우리들의 인생과 엇더한 의의를 가젓는가?\n한 번 더 우리는 이것을 究明할 것이다.\n\n3\n예술이란 무엇이냐? 한 편의 시, 한 폭의 그림은 웨 그리느냐? 우리 인생과 무슨 관계가 잇느냐? 그리고 더욱이 무산계급은 엇지해서 그들의 예술를 가지려고 하느냐?\n이것울 설명하기 위해서 약간의 新舊批評家의 定義를 가장 간단하게 말하려 한다.\n18세기 佛國문예비평가 『삐네트』는 『문학이라는 것은 인간이 그 자신을 종합적으로 다른 인간에게 표현하려는 모든 書物』을 말한다고 하엿다. 또 가튼 『뽀스네트』는 말하기를 『문학이라는 것은 상상, 감정과 밋 취미를 통해서의 사상이 씨여잇는 표현』이라고는＜68＞ 하엿스나 그 가운데는 명백지 못한 모순이 잇는 것이다. 예술적 작품은 그 작품을 읽은 독자의 理智에 호소하기 전에 먼저 감정에 부드치게 된다. 정서에 感染되게 된다. 그럼으로 『자기를 남에게 표현』한다든지 혹은 자기의 「사상을 남에게 표현하는 데에는 예술적 작품이 안이라도 할 수 잇스니 이 자기 사상의 표현이란 정론도 될 수 잇스며 사상적 논문으로도 될 수 잇스며 열렬한 웅변으를도 할 수 잇는 것이다. 그러나 『예술』이라는 것은 上論한 모든 수단과 갓치 오즉 理智에서 理智로 표현하는 것이 안이라 오즉 정서에서 정서로 傳播되는 것이니 즉 『자기의 사상』의 표현은 예술영역에서 이 정서와 감정- 정서를 결합케 하는 수단이다. 예술은 이 정서와 정서를 결합케 하는 한 완전한 고귀한 수단이다. 그럼으로 『레오, 틀스토이』는 그의 예술론 『예술이란 무엇이냐?』라는 논문 가운데 『예술은 정서-감정를 感染케 하는 것이라』고 지당한 말을 한 것이다.\n\n4\n그러면 이 『자기의 사상』 혹은 『자기의 표현』이라는 것을 정서적 수단-예술-을 통해서 즉 자기의 감정을 다른 사람의 감정에 감염케 하는 것이 예술의 定義가 된다면 이 예술 내용을 형성한 『자기사상』이나 『자기의 표현』이란 이 『자기』는 무엇인가.\n이 『자기』라는 것은 개인주의자들이 주장하려는 이기주의적 개인을 말하지 안는 것은 물론이다. 그것은 말할 수 업는 것이다. 예술적 작품을 구성해논 그 핵심인 『자기』는 결단코 孤島에 漂着한 『로빈손』의 『자기』가 안이다. 그것은 한 사회 가온데서 엇게 된 자기개체에 刺戟된 의식 즉 사회의식이 그것이다. 예술은 혼자서 亨樂하려는 것이 안이라 남의 감정에 감염하는 까닭으로 일반이 공감하고 잇는 사회적 의식에 부듸치지 안으면 안이된다. 『완전한 개인주의는 개인이 혼자 잇는데서 실현되는 것이 안이라 다수한 가운데서라야 실현될 수 잇다』는 선배이 말과 갓치 그 작품이 예술적이면 예술적일수록 남의 감정에 더 만히 감염되면 될수록 그 작품 속에서 표현되려는 『자기』는 점점 사회적 의의를 더 만히 갓게 되며 따러서 『자기』라는 것은 『사회적 의의』과 異語同義의 것이 되고 마는 것이다.\n『엇지해서 守錢奴는 일어버린 금전에 대해서 노래할 수가 업슬까? 대단히 간단하다. -가령 그가 그의 捐失에 대해서 노래를 부른다 하드랴도 그의 노래는 아모도 감동케 할 수 업다. 다시 말하면 그와 다른 사람 새이에 수단으로써 소용이 업는 까닭이다.』라고 『뿌레하노프』는 정당히 말하엿다.(이하략-원문)\n\n咸興陵行陪從記\n何夢\n今回의 感興行은 陪行이라는 語가 임의 피동적이오 겸하야 突然에서 나온 일이라 北關의 地理太祖의 역사는 姑捨하고 此紀行의 根底될 關北殿陵誌一冊도 閱見치 못하야 거의 赤手로 戰線에 立하는 감이 有하외다.(畧-원문)\n\n기차가 大路에 橫走하며 驛站올 통과할 때마다 祗迎祗送의 官民이 *를 成하얏나이다.

대하야 우리는 冷然한 理智와 明晢한 두뇌로 현실에 입각한 정책을 수립하며 XXXXX 규정하여야 할 것이다.\n\n2\n여성의 과거를 역사적으로 溯及하야 회고하여 보면 여성은 남성과 본질적으로 차이를 가진 低級의 인간이 아니다.\n과거의 여성은 知能이나 체질 또는 사회적 지위로나 정치상 권리로 보아 남성에게 하등의 손색이 업는 평등한 인간이엿섯다. 오직 천연적 성능상 구별로 남녀의 성적 구별이 잇슬 따름이오 인권상, 인격상, 차별적 지위에 잇섯던 것이 아니다. 이것은 인종학자, 생물학자 등 연구에 의하야 알 수 잇는 것이다.\n그러면 고정한 차별을 가지지 안은 남성과 對等의 지위를 가젓던 여성이 오놀날가치 여성이＜64＞ 사회적 諸般條件에 잇서서 남성보다 낙오된 예속적 생활을 하게까지의 원인은

변천하여 온 과정을 살피혀 보면 원시XX제시대 奴隷시대, 農奴封建制時代, 자본제시대 이러케 구별할 수 잇다.\n이 경제조직의 표현된 이 각종의 *度는 그 발달과정의 형태를 보인 것이오 그 質에 잇서서는 二大財産制度가 잇스니 其一은 집단적 共産制이오. 二는 其個人的이오 이기적인 사유재산제도 이것이다.\n이 두가지 재산제도 우에 각종의 경제조직이 構成되엿고 諸種社會的 문화가 독립되엿던 것이다.\n그러면 여성이 사회적으로나 기타 모든 권리상으로 보아 하등의 차이도 업던 그 생산력시대는 언제이엿던가. 그것은 전자이오. 其役法의 변환과 동시에 재산제도가 其*者로 변환됨으로부터 비로소 여성에게는 불리한 모든 조건이 생기기 시작하엿던 것이다.\nXX사회는 여성을 對等의 생산자로서 평등한 권리를 주엇스나 사유재산제 그것은 여성을 생산노동자로 化하게 하는 동시에 여성에게 인권과 인격을 剝奪하고 남성의 사유적 소유물로 가정노예, 玩弄物의 비인간대우를 하기 시작하엿섯다.\n이때로부터 비로소 여성은 사회적오로 완전한 인권을 가지지 못한 半人間의 대우를 밧게 되엿고 그들에게서는 사회상 모든 지위와 교양의＜65＞ 상실을 당하고 말엇다. 爾後 사유제도의 발달에 따라서 더욱이 여성은 몰락의 地陷에 빠지게 되엿슬 뿐이오 녯 지위에 複舊는 그것은 이상에도 쓴 바와 가치 경제적의인 근본적 변형이 업섯던 까닭이다.(하략-원문)＜66＞\n\n露西亞의 산 文學\n金明植\n\n1\n「또쓰또에프쓰키」는 露西亞에서 아즉 격렬한 산업혁명이 일어나기 전에 일즉 도회에 잇는 貧民屈의 광경을 그려내고 도회의 細民을 위하야 生의 福音을 고취한

Writing"},{"path":"07_1930.07/340.txt","issue":"07_1930.07","content":"My heart feels swollen, as if filled with hope. How can one explain this feeling? No matter how insignificant (微微) a nation (民族) may be, surely there must be places built up with its own blood and sweat (피땀). However, for those looking towards the future (압흘), Hŭngnam was merely a place that evoked interest (興味) and sensation (感覺). But having seen Hŭngnam three times – in Shōwa 8 (1933), 9 (1934), and now 11 (1936) – my impressions (感想) have quite changed. This doesn't mean my initial thrill (感激) has cooled (식엇다는). Rather, on top of that thrill, I have come to possess a new kind of mystical feeling (神秘感), akin to awe (畏敬).\n\nIndeed (卽), I have heard much praise (讚辭) for Mr. Noguchi Shitagau (野口遵), the master (主人) and meritorious figure (功勞者) behind the construction of Hŭngnam (興南建設). Truly (果然), without some kind of genius-like wisdom (智慧), courageous decision-making (勇斷), and driving force (迫力), one cannot imagine that the foremost base (根據地) for the chemical industry (化學工業) in East Asia (東洋) would have emerged today. However, on the other hand (또한편), one can also ask: when he brought the technology (技術), capital (資本), passion (熱), and sincerity (誠意) he possessed, was Hŭngnam truly a land with the fitting destiny (因緣) and qualification (資格)? In other words (다시 말하면), what geographical relationships (地理的 關係) did Hŭngnam possess that drew Mr. Noguchi here, across ten thousand *ri* (萬里) to these green mountains (靑山)?\n\nMany people say that Mr. Noguchi's choice (擇) of Hŭngnam was merely due to a chance discovery (偶然 發見). They say that sometime (언젠가), while returning from inspecting (視察) a mine (鑛山) in Ŭllyul (殷栗), Hwanghae Province (黃海道), he had abandoned (抛棄) his plan (計劃) to generate electricity (電氣) using the hydraulic power (水力) of the Yesŏnggang River (禮成江) and was disheartened (落心). Just then (마츰), he heard a report (報告) from an official (官吏) of the Government-General (總督府) who had explored (探險) the Hŏch'ŏn'gang (虛川江) and Pujŏn'gang (赴戰江) rivers. Suddenly (문득), ambition (野心) stirred (動) within him, and the result (結果) of his subsequent survey (踏査) was the construction (建設) of a large factory (大工場) utilizing the hydroelectric power (水力電氣) of the Pujŏn'gang. If this idea had not occurred (떠오르지 안햇스면) in his mind (腦裏), Hŭngnam today would have remained nothing more than a single (一個), tiny fishing village (漁村). Therefore, they say the key to the success (成功) of Mr. Noguchi, who made this succeed, lies in coincidence (偶然性).\n\nBut why necessarily (하필이면) the Hŏch'ŏn'gang and Pujŏn'gang? If the suitable site (適地) for a hydroelectric power plant (水力發電所) had been some remote (외따른) island or deep in the mountains (山中), would a Hŭngnam like today's have arisen (생겨 낫겟슴닛가)? A large-scale industry (大規模 工業) capable of utilizing such power generation would have to follow. However, the fact that, due to the geographical circumstances (地理的 關係上) within Korea (朝鮮), there was no other place like Hŭngnam for establishing a chemical industry using hydroelectricity will be the crucial key. Hŭngnam, as a good harbor (良港) on the East Sea (東海), has abundant marine products (海産物). Its hinterland (背後地) possesses abundant agricultural (農産物), forest (林産物), marine (水産物), and underground resources (地下資源). With convenient transportation (交通), it is convenient for gathering the goods (物資) from its hinterland and also convenient for shipping them out to other places (他處), possessing a natural (天然) good harbor. Seen this way (이러케 보면), Hŭngnam was waiting for Mr. Noguchi, and Mr. Noguchi found (차즌것이라) Hŭngnam. In short (要컨대), while there might have been an element of chance (偶然性) in Mr. Noguchi's success, of course (勿論), it should be seen that inevitability (必然性) played a larger role.\n\nOwing to this connection (因緣), Hŭngnam and Mr. Noguchi joined hands, and over the following ten, no, twelve or thirteen years (十二三年동안), Hŭngnam has truly (實로) undergone astonishing (驚異的) development (發展). The Chōsen Chisso Hiryō Kabushiki Kaisha (朝鮮窒素肥料株式會社), which initially started (始作) with a capital (資本金) of fifty or sixty thousand Yen (五六萬圓), has today swelled (불어 낫고) to the enormous sum (巨額) of 85 million Yen (八千五百萬圓) in capital. Encompassing (包括) the vast area (廣大 地帶) covering Pujŏn-gun (赴戰郡) and Sinhŭng-gun (新興郡) in Hamgyŏngnam-do (咸南), there are four power plants (發電所 四個處) with a total generation capacity (總發電高) of 325,000 kilowatts (三十二萬五千키로왓트). On the Hŭngnam pier (興南埠頭), nitrogen (窒素工場) and ammonium sulfate plants (硫安工場) have been constructed (建設), currently (現在) producing (生産) 500,000 tons (五十萬톤) of fertilizer (肥料) annually (年間), valued at approximately (約) 55 million Yen (五千五百萬圓). Derived (派生) from these are sulfuric acid plants (硫酸工場), nitric acid plants (硝酸工場), hardened oil plants (硬化油工場), catalyst manufacturing plants (觸媒製作所), and various kinds (各種) of workshops (工作工場) lined up. If you add the carbide (카바이트) plant currently under construction (建設中) and the newly established (新設) Hŭngnam Refinery (興南製鍊所), the total number (總數) of employees (從業員) reaches 13,000 (萬三千名), and the population (人口) of Hŭngnam-ŭp (興南邑) has reached 45,000 (四萬五千名), transforming it into a major city (一大都市) of Northern Korea (北朝鮮).\n<32>\nWhat are the future ambitions (將來 抱負) of Hŭngnam, which has developed so rapidly (勇躍的)?\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis 1936 article by Yi Kwangsu describes the phenomenal industrial development of Hŭngnam, focusing on the massive chemical complex established by Noguchi Shitagau's Chōsen Chisso Hiryō Kabushiki Kaisha. Yi reflects on his changing impressions of the city over three visits, moving from simple interest to a sense of awe mixed with mystery. He debates whether Noguchi's success was pure chance (discovering the hydroelectric potential of the Pujŏn'gang after abandoning plans elsewhere) or inevitable destiny, arguing that Hŭngnam's geographical advantages (good harbor, resource-rich hinterland, suitable location for large-scale hydroelectric-powered chemical industry) made it uniquely qualified. The article details the enormous growth in capital, power generation, fertilizer production, related industries, and population, transforming Hŭngnam from a small fishing village into a major industrial center in northern Korea. From a historical perspective, the article is revealing as it showcases a prominent Korean intellectual, Yi Kwangsu, praising Japanese-led industrialization in colonial Korea, framing it almost mystically as a destined partnership between Japanese capital/technology (Noguchi) and Korean geography (Hŭngnam). Historians might find Yi's perspective, the detailed statistics on the scale of the Chisso enterprise, and the justification of development (balancing chance vs. inevitability/geographical destiny) particularly interesting for understanding colonial narratives of modernization and collaboration.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n興南\t흥남\tHŭngnam\n朝鮮\t조선\tChosŏn\n東洋\t동양\tTongyang\n李光洙\t이광수\tYi

Friends throughout the land, let us run out to the wide fields and shape 1930 meaningfully. Though joy may come quickly to those who suffer, old age also comes quickly in return. This state of tension does not last so long, so let us quickly and diligently accomplish the tasks entrusted to us each day. Therefore, this humble person has resolved to steadily publish the *Samch'ŏlli* (三千里) magazine this year as well, so please offer much reprimand and assistance. Also, starting from the New Year, we have devised the *Samch'ŏlli* Member System (三千里 社友制); this comes from the humble intention of strengthening the financial foundation of our company, even if only slightly, and also from the desire to gain your spiritual anticipation. Please, by all means, offer much approval.\n\nThe next issue will be published on February 1st as a special \"Golden Age Issue\" (全盛時代號). As for why this month's New Year issue turned out so meager, as you may know, during the magazine editing period in early to mid-December, due to a certain atmosphere that suddenly arose, the matter of the magazine itself seemed entirely uncertain, preventing us from dedicating our full effort to editing. Furthermore, important contributors who were writing for us unfortunately ended up in such circumstances, unavoidably resulting in this state. However, starting from the next issue, we will restore things.(P'ain)\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis editorial postscript from the July 1930 issue of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine reflects on the start of the new year, urging diligence and announcing the editor's renewed commitment to publishing the magazine. It introduces a new membership system (\"Sahuje,\" 社友制) to bolster finances and gain reader support, previews the next issue's theme (\"Golden Age Issue\"), and apologizes for the current issue's poor quality. The editor attributes the deficiencies to disruptions (\"a certain atmosphere\") in December that hindered editing and prevented key writers from contributing. For historians, the piece is revealing due to its candid (though veiled) reference to external pressures (\"a certain atmosphere\") likely hinting at colonial censorship or political interference impacting publishing activities. The mention of establishing a reader membership system also sheds light on the financial struggles and strategies of Korean cultural enterprises under colonialism.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n파인\t파인\tP'ain\n\n**Glossary**\n\n編輯餘言\t편집여언\tEditorial remarks; postscript (often at the end of a publication)\n울니고\t울리고\tTo ring; to sound (older spelling of 울리고)\n내다라\t내달아\tTo run out; dash out (older spelling/form of 내달아)\n마튼\t맡은\tEntrusted; taken charge of (older spelling of 맡은)\n이루워 놋습시다\t이루어 놓읍시다\tLet's accomplish/achieve (older spelling/grammar: 이루워 for 이루어, 놋다 for 놓다, -습시다 formal propositive ending)\n社友制\t사우제\tMember system; associate system (refers to the magazine's reader subscription/support system)\n굿게\t굳게\tFirmly; strongly (older spelling of 굳게)\n엇고 십흔\t얻고 싶은\tWanting to gain/obtain (older spelling: 엇고 for 얻고, 십흔 for 싶은)\n오모조록\t아무쪼록\tBy all means; please (older spelling of 아무쪼록)\n來號\t내호\tNext issue (of a publication)\n全盛時代號\t전성시대호\tGolden Age Issue (special issue theme title)\n이가치\t이같이\tLike this; in this way (older spelling of 이같이)\n엇든\t어떤\tA certain; some kind of (older spelling of 어떤)\n도모지\t도무지\t(Not) at all; utterly; entirely (often used with negatives)\n업섯스며\t없었으며\tDid not exist; was not (older spelling/form of 없었으며)\n주시든\t주시던\t(Someone who) used to give/write (older spelling of 주시던, referring to contributors)\n되여\t되어\tBecoming; turning into (older spelling of 되어)\n이 꼬리\t이 꼴이\tThis state/condition (often implies a poor or undesirable state; older spelling of 이 꼴이)\n되엇사오나\t되었사오나\tAlthough it became; although it happened (older spelling and archaic humble ending -사오나)\n복구하겟사외다\t복구하겠습니다\tWill restore; will recover (older spelling and formal ending -겠사외다)\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n잡지명\t삼천리 제7호\n발행일\t1930년 07월 01일\n기사제목\t編輯餘言\n기사형태\t사고·편집후기\n\n編輯餘言\n새해의 종소리는 둥둥 울니고 성문은 열어짐니다. 천하의 벗들이어 너른 들로 내다라 1930년을 뜻이 잇게 꾸밉시다. 고생하는 사람에겐 樂도 빨니 오겟지만 그 대신 「늙음」도 빨니 오는 법이외다. 이 긴장한 태도가 그리케 오래가는 것이 아니오니 어서 하로 급히 제 마튼 일을 꾸준히 이루워 놋습시다. 그래서 小人도 올해에는 「三千里」잡지를 꾸준히 하여 나갈 결심이니 여러분도 만흔 꾸지람과 도움을 주옵소서. 또 新年부터 「三千里」 社友制를 꾸미엇는데 이것은 다소라도 본사의 경제적 기초를 굿게 하랴는 뜻과 또한 여러분의 정신적 기대를 엇고 십흔 微意에서 나온 바니 오모조록 만히 讚同하여 주옵소서.\n\n來號는 「全盛時代號」로 특집하여 2월 1일에 발행하겟사외다. 그러고 이 달 新年號가 이가치 빈약하게 된 것은 여러분도 아실 터이나 잡지편집 시기이든 12월초 중순에 이르러 홀연히 이러난 엇든 분위기 때문에 잡지 云云의 문제가 도모지 아닐 것 갓하여 편집에 전력을 할 수 업섯스며 또 집필하여 주시든 重要諸氏- 그만 그러케 되여 부득이 이 꼬리 되엇사오나 來號부터는 다시 復舊하겟사외다.(파인)","magazine":"三千里 제7호","date":"1930년 07월 01일","title":"Editor's Comments"},{"path":"07_1930.07/351.txt","issue":"07_1930.07","content":"Company Announcement\n\nIn the New Year, this company (本社) has dispatched our external affairs staff member, Mr. Kim Irhŏn (金日憲君), to the Hamgyŏng Pukto region (咸北各地) to handle member recruitment (社友募集), advertising (廣告), and other matters.
