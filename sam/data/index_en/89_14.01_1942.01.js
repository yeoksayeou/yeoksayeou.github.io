It explicitly supports Japan's declaration of war against the United States and Britain, framing it as a righteous effort alongside allies Germany and Italy to establish the New East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The piece details scheduled compulsory events for January 1st across colonial Korea, including synchronized worship towards the Imperial Palace and ceremonies involving the Governor-General, demonstrating enforced participation in Japanese imperial rituals. For historians, the article is a stark example of pro-Japanese propaganda and expressions of loyalty published by Koreans during the late colonial period, reflecting the intense pressure for assimilation and support for the Japanese war effort. It clearly illustrates the mechanisms of ideological mobilization, including mandated ceremonies like *Kyūjō yōhai* (宮城遙拜) and the veneration of the Emperor's portrait.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n天皇陛下\t천황폐하\tTennō Heika (His Majesty the Emperor)\n皇后陛下\t황후폐하\tKōgō Heika (Her Majesty the Empress)\n皇太子陛下\t황태자폐하\tKōtaishi Heika (His Highness the Crown Prince)\n日本帝國\t일본제국\tJapanese Empire\n獨伊\t독이\tGermany and Italy\n皇師\t황사\tImperial forces\n태평양\t태평양\tPacific Ocean\n新東亞共榮圈\t신동아공영권\tNew East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\n宮城\t궁성\tKyūjō (Imperial Palace)\n전조선\t전조선\tAll of Korea (Chŏn Chosŏn)\n총독부\t총독부\tGovernment-General (Ch'ongdokpu)\n南總督\t남총독\tGovernor-General Minami (Minami Sōtoku)\n京城\t경성\tKyŏngsŏng (Colonial name for Seoul)\n\n**Glossary**\n\n奉禱\t봉도\tTo pray respectfully\n聖壽無疆\t성수무강\tBoundless longevity (used for royalty)\n皇紀\t황기\tImperial Year (Japanese dating system based on Emperor Jimmu's legendary ascension)\n際하야\t제하야\tOn the occasion of (archaic form of -즈음하여)\n萬世一系\t만세일계\tUnbroken Imperial line for ages eternal\n皇統\t황통\tImperial lineage/line\n奉戴하옵고\t봉대하옵고\tTo respectfully uphold/support (highly honorific, archaic form)\n一億臣民\t일억신민\tOne hundred million subjects (referring to the populace of the Japanese Empire)\n安居樂業\t안거낙업\tTo live and work in peace and contentment\n亨하야\t향하야\tTo enjoy/experience (life) (archaic form)\n마지하옴애\t맞이하오매\tAs we greet/welcome (archaic/honorific form of 맞이함에)\n황송하오나\t황송하오나\tTo be awed/grateful/reverent (often expressing humility before superiors)\n陛下\t폐하\tYour Majesty/His Majesty/Her Majesty\n萬壽無疆\t만수무강\tBoundless long life (synonym for 聖壽無疆, used for royalty)\n마지안나이다\t마지않나이다\tDoes not cease; endlessly (archaic/honorific form)\n對米\t대미\tTowards America; Anti-American\n對英\t대영\tTowards Britain; Anti-British\n盟邦\t맹방\tAllied nation; ally\n격멸하려\t격멸하려\tIntending to annihilate/destroy\n進케 하야\t진케 하여\tCausing to advance; making advance (archaic causative form)\n戰果\t전과\tBattle results; war gains\n收하고\t수하고\tTo achieve; to collect; to harvest (here, achieving results)\n未久\t미구\tSoon; before long\n맹주\t맹주\tLeader (of an alliance or group)\n共榮圈\t공영권\tCo-Prosperity Sphere\n我等\t아등\tWe; us (somewhat archaic/formal)\n心力\t심력\tHeart and strength; mental and physical effort\n봉사할 바임\t봉사할 바임\tThe fact that one should serve (archaic/formal nominalization)\n自期하오며\t자기하오며\tPledging/committing oneself (honorific form)\n삼가\t삼가\tRespectfully; reverently\n폐하께옵서와\t폐하께옵서와\tTo Your Majesty and...

They have already annihilated the Far East fleets of both nations in the Pacific Ocean, striking fear into the enemy's heart. We reverently express our gratitude that this is truly due to the valiant fighting of the officers and men of the Imperial Army (皇軍將兵), peerless under His Majesty's august virtue (御稜威). We, the people, must break through this national crisis, the first since the founding of the nation (肇國), with iron-like solidarity.\n\nNow, the Empire, marshalling its total strength, has opened the gates of a holy war (聖戰) to liberate the one billion peoples of East Asia who cried out under the exploitation of the cunning and tyrannical America and Britain. This is truly <16> not only a holy war for Greater East Asia (大東亞), aiming to build an East Asia for East Asians, but furthermore, it is a Holy War for the construction of a New World Order based on the grand ideal of Hakko Ichiu (八紘一宇, Eight Corners of the World under One Roof). We are confident that the loyal, brave, and invincible officers and men of the Imperial Army, aided by divine spirits (神明), will fight fiercely and crush both America and Britain, who style themselves as world powers, in the near future. Now is truly the time when we, the one hundred million people of the home front, must become one heart and one body, without a single person falling behind or deserting. With the tension of all being on the front line, we must build an impregnable fortress on the home front (銃後陣) while simultaneously becoming warriors who display the highest level of effort and production in our respective workplaces. Strictly maintaining secrecy, not being swayed by malicious rumors, and wholeheartedly devoting ourselves to workplace service (職域奉公) with iron conviction and unwavering resolve is, we believe, the duty of the people on the home front.\n\nFinally, while shouting \"Banzai!\" for the certain victory in the Great East Asia War, we offer a moment of silent prayer to console the spirits of the fallen officers and men, and we wish for their lasting military fortunes.\n\nJanuary 1, Showa 17 (1942)\nSamch'ŏlli Company (三千里社), Kyŏngsŏng (京城) Chongno <17>\n<16-17>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis editorial from the Korean magazine *Samch'ŏlli*, published just weeks after Pearl Harbor, expresses fervent support for Japan's declaration of war against the US and UK, framing it as a \"Holy War\" to liberate Asia and establish a \"New World Order\" under the Japanese ideal of *Hakko Ichiu*. It praises the Japanese military's initial successes, calls for Koreans (\"the people,\" implicitly including Koreans as subjects of the Empire) to unite with \"iron solidarity,\" maintain secrecy, avoid rumors, and dedicate themselves fully to production and support on the home front (*chonghu*, 銃後) through \"workplace service\" (*chigyŏk ponggong*, 職域奉公). The piece concludes by praying for victory, consoling the spirits of fallen Japanese soldiers, and wishing for continued military success. For historians, this text is a stark example of collaborationist discourse in colonial Korea during the peak of wartime mobilization. It demonstrates how some Korean voices actively participated in disseminating Japanese imperial propaganda, adopting its rhetoric of holy war, racial liberation (of Asia from the West), imperial benevolence, and the necessity of total sacrifice for the war effort, explicitly positioning Koreans within the framework of the Japanese Empire's subjects supporting the war.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n大東亞戰爭\t대동아전쟁\tGreat East Asia War\n陸海空軍皇兵\t육해공군황병\tImperial Soldiers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force\n三千里社\t삼천리사\tSamch'ŏlli Company\n我帝國\t아제국\tOur Empire (Japanese Empire)\n米英\t미영\tAmerica and Britain (US/UK)\n皇軍將兵\t황군장병\tOfficers and men of the Imperial Army\n大東亞\t대동아\tGreater East Asia\n八紘一宇\t팔굉일우\tHakko Ichiu\n皇軍\t황군\tImperial Army\n京城\t경성\tKyŏngsŏng (Colonial name for Seoul)\n鍾路\t종로\tChongno (District in Seoul/Kyŏngsŏng)\n\n**Glossary**\n\n皇兵\t황병\tImperial soldier(s)\n聖戰\t성전\tHoly War\n마지하여\t맞이하여\tFacing, welcoming (older spelling of 맞이하여)\n暴戾無雙\t포려무쌍\tSingularly violent and outrageous\n米英\t미영\tAmerica and Britain (abbreviation)\n御稜威\t어릉위\tAugust virtue/majesty (of the Emperor)\n萬邦無比\t만방무비\tPeerless among all nations\n肇國\t조국\tFounding of the nation\n鐵石\t철석\tIron and stone (metaphor for firmness, solidarity)\n돌파하여야 하겠나이다\t돌파하여야 하겠습니다\tMust break through (older, very formal/deferential verb ending)\n들어써\t들어서\tBy using, by lifting (older spelling/form of 들어서)\n노회포학\t노회포학\tCunning and tyrannical\n동양 제민족\t동양 제민족\tThe peoples of East Asia\n八紘一宇\t팔굉일우\tHakko Ichiu (Japanese political slogan: Eight corners of the world under one roof)\n基한\t기한\tBased on (form of 기반한)\n神明\t신명\tDivine spirits, gods\n睹하여서\t도하여서\tAided by (older form/usage, perhaps related to 돕다)\n力戰하여\t역전하여\tFighting fiercely\n아등\t아등\tWe, us (archaic pronoun)\n총후국민\t총후국민\tPeople of the home front\n일심일체\t일심일체\tOne heart, one body; complete unity\n물샐틈없는\t물샐틈없는\tWatertight, impenetrable\n銃後陣\t총후진\tHome front position/fortress\n축성하는\t축성하는\tBuilding (a fortress)\n직장\t직장\tWorkplace\n전사\t전사\tWarrior, soldier\n기밀엄수\t기밀엄수\tStrict maintenance of secrets\n유언비어\t유언비어\tMalicious rumors, groundless rumors\n不退轉\t부퇴전\tUnwavering, not retreating\n일로\t일로\tWholeheartedly, solely\n職域奉公\t직역봉공\tWorkplace service (wartime mobilization term for dedicating labor to the war effort)\n盡瘁함이\t진췌함이\tDevoting oneself completely (older form/usage)\n전몰장병\t전몰장병\tFallen officers and men (in battle)\n묵도\t묵도\tSilent prayer\n무운장구\t무운장구\tLasting military fortune\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n잡지명\t삼천리 제14권 제1호\n발행일\t1942년 01월 01일\n기사제목\t大東亞戰爭과 陸海空軍皇兵에 感謝, 聖戰 제6년을 마지하여\n필자\t三千里社\n기사형태\t사고·편집후기\n\n大東亞戰爭과 陸海空軍皇兵에 感謝, 聖戰 제6년을 마지하여\n\t\t\t\t\t\t三千里社\n我帝國은 지난 12월 8일에 暴戾無雙한 米英 양국에 대하야 선전을 포고한 이래 我 무적 육해공군의 활약은 史上에 보기 드문 바 있어 벌서 태평양에서 양국의 극동함대를 격멸하여 적의 간담을 서늘케 하고 있는데, 이 실로 御稜威下 萬邦無比의 皇軍將兵의 奮戰에 있음을 삼가 감사드리는 바이며, 肇國이래 처음인 이 국난을 我等 국민은 鐵石의 단결로써 돌파하여야 하겠나이다.\n이제 제국은 총력을 들어써 노회포학한 米英의 착취하에 울던 십억의 동양 제민족을 해방하는 성전의 포문을 열었는 바, 이는 실로＜16＞ 동양인의 동양을 건설하려는 대동아의 성전일뿐 아니라 나아가서는 八紘一宇의 대이상에 基한 世界新秩序 建設의 聖戰으로, 忠勇無敵한 황군장병이 神明을 睹하여서 力戰하여 주므로써 머지않은 장래에 세계적 강국으로 자처하는 미영 양국을 격파할 것을 확신하나이다. 이때야말로 아등 일억의 총후국민은 일심일체되여 한사람의 낙오와 이탈이 없이 모두 제일선에 나선 긴장으로써 물샐틈없는 완벽의 銃後陣을 축성하는 동시에 각각 자기직장에서 최고도의 노력과 생산을 나타내는 전사가 되여야 하겠나이다. 기밀엄수, 유언비어에 현혹되지 말고 鐵石의 신념과 不退轉의 결의로써 일로 職域奉公에 盡瘁함이 총후국민의 의무라 생각하나이다.\n끝으로 대동아전쟁의 필승을 만세부르는 동시에, 전몰장병의 영령에 삼가 위안의 묵도를 드리며, 및 무운장구를 소원하나이다.\n昭和 17년 1월 1일\n京城鍾路 三千里社 ＜17＞\n＜16-17＞","magazine":"三千里 第14卷 第1號","date":"1942년 01월 01일 (January 1, 1942)","title":"Gratitude to the Imperial Soldiers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force for the Greater East Asia War: Facing the 6th Year of the Holy War"},{"path":"89_14.01_1942.01/030.txt","issue":"89_14.01_1942.01","content":"**The Greater East Asia War and the Armament of the Peninsula, Special Feature: Transcript of the Great Decisive Battle Speeches**\n\nFor the past several hundred years, the common enemies of all peoples of the East, the United States and Great Britain, who not only fattened themselves through all sorts of exploitation and oppression by invading the East but also obstructed Our Empire's construction of the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, were finally met with the Empire's righteous sword on December 8th. Within three days of the war's beginning, the incomparably loyal and brave officers and soldiers of Our Imperial Army not only annihilated the Pacific fleets of both the US and Britain and destroyed the majority of the US and British air forces, but also captured Hong Kong, the stronghold of British aggression in the East, on December 25th,<18> achieving truly unprecedented results in the history of warfare. This is not only a joy for the entire nation but also the aspiration of all peoples of the East. The fall of the Philippines, Malaya, Singapore, Borneo, etc., has already become a matter of time. Immediately following this great East Asian Holy War, on December 10th, the National General Mobilization League held a Great Decisive Battle Speech Meeting to promote the armament of the Peninsula's populace and establish a decisive battle system.\n\nI. The Decisive Battle System and the People's Ordeal --- Yun Ch'i-ho\nII. The True Nature of the Enemy Nations --- Chang Tŏk-su\nIII. Who is the Disturber of the World? --- Sin Hŭng-u\nIV. The Construction of New East Asia and Korea --- Kim Ch'ŏn-sŏng\nV. The Time for Our Uprising --- Cho Pyŏng-sang\n\n**The Decisive Battle System and the People's Ordeal**\nItō Chihō (Yun Ch'i-ho)\n\nThis is something that happened 55 years ago when I first went to Shanghai, and I still cannot forget it. It was when I went to the British Concession across the Suzhou River in Shanghai. Seeing a sign posted at the main gate of the park in that Concession that read, “Dogs and Chinese are not allowed,” I could not suppress my unpleasant impression.<19> The painful and resentful impression from that time, when human beings were treated like dogs, has remained unforgettable throughout my life to this day.\n\nThe arrogance of the Anglo-Saxon race is beyond description. Of course, it is not that they lack admirable points, but they did not only put up such signs in the Shanghai park; they also put up signs in Canada and their other territories stating that only white people could live there. That is, they put up an invisible sign saying that the yellow race should not enter. However, though resentful, we lived until today unable to say anything. Only on December 8th last, with the extra edition announcing the Empire's declaration of war on Britain and America, were we able to resolve this grudge. The extra edition from the morning before last is different from the extra edition during the Manchurian Incident and also different from the extra edition during the China Incident. The war that the Japanese Empire has now initiated against Britain and America is a Holy War for the liberation of the Asian peoples, to rescue them from the oppression of the British and Americans. Therefore, anyone who is an Asian must participate in this fight.\n\nThe day before yesterday, that is, in the early morning of December 8th, the Imperial Navy began combat with the British and American forces in the Western Pacific. At 11:45 AM that day, the Imperial Rescript concerning the declaration of war was promulgated. This is the first great war since the Pacific Ocean came into being, and the responsibility—whether to call it responsibility or sin—for starting this great war lies 100 percent with the United States. The United States has no need nor justification to come to East Asia and provoke a war. Therefore, this war is truly the Holy War among Holy Wars. When I think about this, I feel as if I have become about 10 years younger. When the Japanese Empire's Army, Navy, and Air Force fight on the Pacific Ocean, some 3,000 miles away, to rescue one billion Asian people from the oppression of the British and Americans, we must become even more determined. Of course, I know everyone gathered here is determined. However, we must be even more determined in our workplaces or in any endeavor, and at this time, the first since the beginning of affairs, contribute even one ten-thousandth of our strength to demonstrate our worth as subjects of the Empire.\n\nIn May of Meiji 38 (1905), when Admiral Tōgō crushed the Baltic Fleet in the Tsushima Strait, the national power and the people's honor of the Japanese Empire underwent a global ordeal, and it leaped into the ranks of the world's strongest powers. At that time, Admiral Tōgō's signal, \"The fate of the Empire rests on this one battle,\" did not merely decide the contest with the Baltic Fleet but determined whether the Japanese Empire would become the leader of the New East Asia or not.\n\nNow, the stage where our Empire must fight the decisive battle is not a small strait but the Pacific Ocean. The opponent is not a single fleet but<20> a group of the world's second and third-ranking great naval powers. Not only does the fate of the Empire rest on this decisive battle, but the fate of all the various peoples of East Asia depends on it. This is truly a Holy War, and the eyes of the world are focused on the point of whether our one hundred million people have the resolve and ability to endure this unprecedented Great Ordeal.\n\nWe can be confident that the eighty million compatriots in the homeland (Naichi, i.e., Japan proper) have the resolve and ability to endure this ordeal. The Yamato people, under the Imperial Household, which is of one lineage unbroken for ages eternal, have cultivated loyalty and patriotism over 2,600 long years. Furthermore, the traditional training, bravery, and spirit of the samurai, victorious in a hundred battles, have become their blood, their muscles, and their marrow, giving them the perseverance and fighting power to break through difficulties in any situation.\n\nAs a person of the Peninsula (Pando, i.e., Korea), I am concerned about whether our Peninsular populace can endure this Great Ordeal like the people of the homeland in response to this decisive battle system. The reason is not that our disposition is bad, but that the custom of respecting literature and despising martial arts for hundreds of years still dominates our thinking. Regarding this, I would like to relate an anecdote that comes to mind now. About 40-odd years ago, when the King at that time went out beyond the East Gate (Dongdaemun), one of the military officials attending him removed the blade from the ceremonial sword (環刀) he wore at his waist, leaving only the empty hilt in the scabbard, saying, \"It is disrespectful for a person accompanying the King to carry a sword on his body.\" Can we, who have fallen into such extremely effete literary thought and customs, break through this Great Ordeal which demands the utmost bravery, training, and perseverance? This worry is not absent.\nHowever, this flaw is not an innate defect of our people but merely a leftover defect from ancient customs and habits, so it can be improved, and it must be improved.\n\nMoreover, whether we pass through the ordeal of this decisive battle well or poorly will determine the fate of our 24 million compatriots. At this time when the nation faces a critical juncture of survival or ruin, only if we have the determination to share the sweet and the bitter, and share life and death with our compatriots in the homeland, realizing the great ideal of Japan and Korea as One Body (內鮮一體), regardless of whether at the front lines or behind the lines, will our existence and future become bright. If anyone among us takes actions or holds thoughts contrary to the national policy (國策), our future will not escape self-destruction. Conversely, if we join forces wholeheartedly with our compatriots in the homeland, work together, endure together, and strive together, advancing with the grand plan and determination to build an East Asia for East Asians, the day when the various peoples of the new East Asia coexist and co-prosper, shedding the racial discrimination and arrogant oppression of the white man, can be expected as surely as the sun will rise<21> in the eastern sky tomorrow morning.\n\nAs I am an old man, I would like to offer a final word to the elderly. We cannot be active like the young people. However, we can encourage the activities of the young. Even if something goes against traditional customs and habits in our thinking, if it conforms to the national policy, let us elderly encourage it. For example, regarding the volunteer soldier system (지원병제도) and the National Total Labor Movement (國民皆勞運動), the thoughts and attitudes of the elderly have a great influence on determining the attitudes and thoughts of the young. If there are volunteers among your descendants, let us encourage them. Seeing that the number of volunteers reached 250,000 this year proves that the disposition of the Peninsula's youth does not despise martial matters. If the elderly encourage them a little more, the quality and quantity of volunteers will improve even further.\nThe National Total Labor Movement is the secret to pioneering a path for the Peninsula's populace. To break the traditional custom of looking down on labor, the elderly must liquidate their old-fashioned thoughts and habits. In this world where the entire globe is striving and working hard, leading to the survival of the fittest, if we alone continue the effete lifestyle and the habit of playing and eating according to the old ways of 60 or 70 years ago, we will eventually become dropouts and losers. Therefore, let us elderly also participate in some kind of patriotic movement (報國運動) according to our region and circumstances, and help the activities of the young. In this situation where even scrap materials are utilized, let us not despair just because we are old. In the past, the principle was that the elderly could do nothing, but nowadays, the elderly have their uses. Tonight, too, it is because I am an old man that I was asked to give this lecture. And it is because I am an old man that I accepted.\n(Applause) <22>\n\n**Deployment of ABCD Encirclement Forces**\n\n**The True Nature of the Enemy Nations**\nChang Tŏk-su\n\nI. Completely ending the China Incident and firmly establishing the Co-Prosperity Sphere in the lands of East Asia is the heaven-altering great task proclaimed by the Empire both domestically and internationally. The nations obstructing this great task are the enemy nations. Such enemy nations are, needless to say, the so-called ABCD group of nations: America, Britain, China, and the Dutch East Indies. Among them, the strong powers occupying the leading positions are the two countries, Britain and America. These two countries can indeed be called the main camp of the anti-Japanese encirclement.\nFrance, too, was once an enemy nation following Britain and America, obstructing the Empire's path. But after being struck once by Germany's iron hammer, it fell apart, lost all strength, and especially after the Imperial Army advanced into French Indochina, it is now eager only for peaceful cooperation. Germany and Italy are the Empire's allies. The Soviet Union, as far as the East Asian political situation is concerned, adheres to the neutrality pact with the Empire as its fundamental national policy. Of course, as long as it still bases itself on Communism, absolutely requires British and American support in its decisive war against Germany, and the Chinese Communist Party, which maintains close contact with it, continues its anti-Japanese war, it certainly cannot be called a friendly nation to the Empire. While vigilance may be required in the future, in the current situation, it has no choice but to maintain the neutrality pact with the Empire as an unchanging national policy.\nTherefore, at this time, the only countries that can actively demonstrate hostility towards the Empire's East Asia policy, and are actually doing so, are Britain and America. The other countries in the ABCD camp, and the various small nations of South America that might follow America in the future, are truly negligible, easily brushed aside (凱袖一觸), not even worth discussing.\n\nII. Then, what is the true nature of Britain and America as enemy nations of Japan? As you well know, both Britain and America boast of being the world's greatest wealthy nations.<24> They are strong nations boasting the world's largest navies. However, I do not intend to discuss the reality of their wealth and power now. The reason Britain and America are enemy nations of the Empire is not because they are wealthy and powerful, but because, relying on that wealth and power, they are old forces obstructing the construction of a new order in East Asia, and further, a new world order. Therefore, I would rather examine the fundamental ideology of Anglo-American civilization to expose its true nature from this perspective.\n\nIII. First, although Britain and America call themselves Christian nations, they are not Christian nations. They are, on the contrary, nations of brute force. They are not Christian nations that built their country on the love of Jesus and regulate their actions according to its morality, but merely power states built on worldly desires and brute strength.\nThis is such an obvious fact that there is no need to give examples, but I would like to share a glimpse of what I personally heard and saw in Britain and America for your reference.\nAlthough one would think that an inhumane issue like slavery could not exist in America, which calls itself a Christian nation, you well know that about 80 years ago, there was the tragic War between the States, lasting four years, over the issue of black slaves. No, the issue of mistreatment of black people is still a significant part of unresolved social problems even today.\nTo give an example, one day I went to have lunch at a restaurant on Broadway, which could be called the main street of New York. After ordering my food and sitting down, a respectable-looking black man, appearing to be in his 40s or 50s, came in. Perhaps intending to buy lunch as well, he placed the briefcase he was holding beside him and sat down at a table. After a short while, the restaurant owner went over to the man and whispered a few words. The black man, with a look of indignation on his face, stood up abruptly and left. Finding it very strange, I called the owner over and asked the reason. His reply was, \"We don't sell food to black people here.\" When I asked if black people's money was rusty, he said that if they sold food to black people, white customers wouldn't come. Next, let me tell you a story about something I experienced personally.\nWhen I was at the University of Oregon, I went to a barbershop in that town to get a haircut. The owner of the shop then said, \"We don't cut the hair of Orientals.\" When I asked if he thought Oriental people's hair was made of iron wire, he just insisted they didn't cut Oriental people's hair, asking what more there was to say. So, I had no choice but to return to the university campus and get my hair cut there.\nIn the kingdom of God, there is neither distinction of color nor distinction of sex, yet in America, which calls itself a Christian nation, discrimination against colored races is severe like this.\nWhat about Britain? Britain, which considers itself the world's nation of gentlemen,<25> seems unlikely to sell inhumane goods like opium. But in fact, about 100 years ago, it fought the Opium War with China precisely to sell that opium, as you may freshly recall.\nI will tell you an even more cruel story than that.\nThe era of Queen Elizabeth is considered the golden age in British history. Famous commanders like Drake were born then, and poetic sages like Shakespeare were also born then. During this time, which could be called an era of wise rulers and holy dynasties, a royal decree was issued. It granted British people the special privilege of trading slaves. The gist of its wording was this: \"Any British person may carry guns and swords, attack African villages, capture the black people found there, regardless of gender or age, and sell them all as slaves.\" In other words, human trafficking was openly permitted by national law as a special privilege for British people. What was the name of the first ship of the expeditionary force organized based on this so-called privilege? It was the ship named \"Jesus.\" A famous British port today, Liverpool, is a port that grew fat from this slave trade.\nIf you look through the history of Britain and America, behind their wealth and power run the unjust tears and resentful blood of these slaves. Can such countries be called civilized nations of morality? (Applause)\n\nIV. Second, Britain and America are said to be countries of liberalism and individualism. However, can a country with a tradition of openly permitting human trafficking truly establish individualism that feels the dignity of the individual? Can it even glimpse liberalism that respects the freedom of the person? Generally, without respecting the value of human beings, one cannot lay the foundation of morality, and where the foundation of morality has crumbled, one cannot build the house of individualism or liberalism. British and American individualism is ultimately egoism, and liberalism is merely licentiousness. In other words, where heavenly reason (天理) has been severed, only private desires dance – that is British and American individualism and liberalism. And what has been built upon such a foundation with science is the so-called industrialism.\nTherefore, in Anglo-American society, built on this \"ideology,\" a worker is primarily a means of production rather than a person, and a capitalist is primarily a capitalist rather than a citizen. The social structure of Britain and America consists of such capitalists and workers confronting each other in a relationship of exchange value, fighting over profits. There is neither understanding nor compassion, only calculation of interests.<26> The strong live, and the weak die. What liberalism or individualism can exist in an animal society where the weak are prey for the strong (弱肉强食)? (Applause)\nReading the past industrial history of Britain, I keenly felt that its so-called industrial civilization was rotten to the core.\n\nV. Can Britain and America, having such a foundation of utilitarian civilization within their own countries, extend a hand of morality outwards? Can they cultivate the virtue of benevolence? More than anything, the facts are the proof. The various peoples of East Asia have had their blood dried up under their exploitation and their bones bent under their tyranny. What about India? What about Malaya? What about the Dutch East Indies and China? Everyone, a good tree bears good fruit, and a bad tree bears bad fruit. This is the true nature of Britain and America, the enemy nations of Imperial Japan, founded on the Imperial Way (皇道). (Applause) <27>\n\n**Who is the Disturber of the World?**\nSin Hŭng-u (Koryŏng Hŭng-u)\n\nThe world situation changes from moment to moment, making it almost unnecessary to examine this issue this evening.\nHowever, as this issue was announced several days ago, I will say a few words here now to maintain my credibility with the public.\nThose who disturb the world are precisely those who, for the past several hundred years, have tried to colonize the entire world economically, politically, and militarily.\nThose who, while invading and exploiting other races and nations through cunning means and beastly violence, deluded themselves into thinking they were bestowing favors upon others – they are the disturbers.\nThis, too, stems from a certain foundational concept. It is impossible in terms of time to trace it back to Adam Smith, who advocated Britain's free trade theory. A modern British writer who had a great ideological influence on the Anglo-Saxon peoples – that is, the British, Americans, Canadians, Australians, New Zealanders, and South Africans – was Kipling.\nHe, who even received the Nobel Prize in 1907, emphasized the so-called \"White Man's Burden.\" This means that the white race must do the work meant for all colored races and guide them.\nHe also said, \"East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet.\"\nIn other words, the East and the West cannot unite. Kipling's thought is representative of Anglo-American thinking. For several decades, whenever there were international meetings, Kipling's words were often quoted in various ways.\nEven if one reads the government's announcement about the recent outcome of the Japan-US talks, the sense of Anglo-Saxon superiority is clearly shown. This concept governed the policies of British and American people towards the East. Britain's oppression of India and Burma, the Opium War against China,<28> the occupation of places like Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Weihaiwei, or the exploitation of resources in the Malay Peninsula and Borneo; America's occupation of Hawaii, the Philippines, Guam, and the Wake Islands, or the construction of naval and air bases on various islands scattered across the Pacific now; their failure to accept racial equality at the Paris Peace Conference while championing humanitarianism and democracy – all these originated from this concept. Thus, not only Asians but all colored races came under threat.\nTherefore, at this time today, unless we in the East break through this encirclement network with all our strength, our future generations, for a hundred or a thousand generations, will not be able to escape eternal bondage (羈絆). Now, the goal of our one hundred million, no, going further, the one billion of East Asia, lies in eradicating the danger from places like Singapore, Manila, and Pearl Harbor. After that, that concept itself will be eliminated. Equality and peace for humanity will come. (Applause) <29>\n\n**The Construction of New East Asia and Korea**\nKim Ch'ŏn-sŏng (Former name Yi Sŏng-gŭn), President of the Maeil Sinbo\n\nThe past December 8th is a day that we can never forget, a day to commemorate. In fact, since February 8th last, the tension and crisis in Japan-US relations had been reported. At that time, Ambassador Nomura was dispatched to conduct Japan-US negotiations, and later Ambassador Kurusu was also dispatched. However, due to America's stubborn attitude, it was anticipated by the premonition of our one hundred million compatriots that the Empire's opinions, which fly the banner of peace and justice, would definitely not be accepted. We waited, wondering if the flames of war between Japan and America would erupt tomorrow or the day after, just waiting for the sound of cannons to burst forth. However, this war, unknown even until the night of the 7th, finally opened its cannon gates in the early morning of the 8th. When you encountered the extra edition announcing this declaration of war, I believe your hearts, too, must have felt like bursting with joy. Of course, it is a common psychological aspect of life's philosophy that everyone dislikes fighting, so our Empire, too, certainly does not enjoy war or take pleasure in killing people. We merely drew the sword of justice reluctantly for the construction of a New East Asia, and taking a step further, for the peace and happiness of humanity. That is, with reverence, in the Great Imperial Rescript issued regarding the declaration of war on Britain and America on the 8th, it was stated:\n\"To secure the stability of East Asia and thereby contribute to world peace is the far-sighted plan formulated by the Great Illustrious Imperial Grandfather and the Great Imperial Father, which We respectfully follow without cease.\"\nJust as stated, constructing a new order in East Asia to secure its stability and thereby contribute to world peace is indeed the grand Imperial aspiration and plan passed down from our country's Imperial Ancestors and Imperial Forebears, and thus, it is the immutable national policy of our country. Therefore, the two wars of the Meiji era, the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars, were the prologue to the Empire's Holy War to establish eternal peace in East Asia. Especially, the Russo-Japanese War was the first beacon fire for the construction of a New East Asian Order, aimed at driving out the influence of the white Russians extending into East Asia. Thus, the Empire achieved<30> an unprecedented great victory in the Russo-Japanese War, swept away Russian influence from Manchuria, and subsequently kicked away America's conspiracy, which intended to stretch its demonic hand into Manchuria again in place of Russia. After the Russo-Japanese War, the American railroad magnate Harriman proposed managing the South Manchuria Railway Company under joint Japan-US administration. A provisional agreement regarding this was reached with our government at the time, and just when the rights in Manchuria, obtained through the shedding of the blood of numerous officers and soldiers, were about to fall into American hands again, and thus our country's great opportunity for continental management was about to become America's tasty bait, due to the strong opposition of Foreign Minister Komura, this American ambition was finally completely frustrated. Foreign Minister Komura was indeed a great statesman who had already planned and intended the construction of a New East Asian Order during the Meiji era. If not for Foreign Minister Komura's opposition, Manchuria would have become an American colony, and who knows what the situation in East Asia would be like now? ******.\nAfter fighting the Russo-Japanese War in this way, our country gradually solidified the foundation for continental management. The Manchurian Incident, which broke out in September of Shōwa 6 (1931), was an epoch-making event that concretely developed the New East Asian Order construction movement initiated by the Empire in the Russo-Japanese War. At that time, the Zhang Xueliang regime, entrenched in Manchuria, backed by the central Chiang Kai-shek government and the British and American powers manipulating it, frequently committed acts damaging the Empire's prestige. Each time, the Empire exercised patience and self-restraint, urging the Zhang Xueliang regime to reflect. However, there is a limit to patience, and the Empire finally rose resolutely, drove out the frivolous and shallow Zhang Xueliang regime, and following the general will of the 30 million people of Manchuria, installed a descendant of the Qing dynasty to newly establish the state of Manchukuo (滿洲國). Manchukuo is truly a moral state in East Asia, based on the ideals of ethnic harmony and a paradise under the kingly way (王道樂土).\nDespite sweeping away the tyrannical rule of warlords and creating a paradise in East Asia, the Chiang Kai-shek regime persistently denied the establishment of Manchukuo. Especially America, from the very beginning of the Manchurian Incident, used the Nine-Power Treaty as a shield and profusely slandered the construction of Manchukuo.\nBritain, too, ran wild, not losing to America, and Britain and America colluded to manipulate the League of Nations to deny Manchukuo.\nAfter that, Chiang Kai-shek concentrated and devoted the nation's entire strength to opposing Japan, repeatedly showing disrespect to the Empire whenever there was stability, causing the situation to become extremely unstable. Thus, finally, in Shōwa 11 (1936), a single gunshot at the Marco Polo Bridge (蘆溝橋) led to the outbreak of the China Incident. Despite the Empire's initial policy of non-expansion, the Chiang Kai-shek regime, relying on the power of Britain and America, continued reckless resistance against Japan, and the incident finally spread uncontrollably large. During this time, the Empire's invincible Army, Navy, and Air Force pressed forward,<31> Chiang Kai-shek was finally reduced to a small regional regime, struggling on the verge of death. In Nanjing, a new legitimate National Government,親日 (pro-Japanese), based on the principles of anti-communism and peace, was born. It is advancing towards the construction of a new China, and further, the construction of a New East Asia, in close cooperation with the Empire.\nHowever, America and Britain, who absolutely want to keep East Asia in a state of slavery to exploit and oppress it at will, plotted to prolong the incident, openly and persistently aiding the Chiang regime to continue its resistance against the Empire. It is truly Britain and America who obstruct the completion of the China Incident and hinder the construction of the New East Asian Order.\nBritain and America are savage and wicked nations that, starting from the mid-19th century, extended their demonic hands into East Asia, especially China, one after another, turning China into their semi-colony.\nBritain, after swallowing India, extended its poisonous fangs to China, initiating the famous Opium War in 1839, snatching Hong Kong, and opening five ports including Canton (廣東), Xiamen (履門), Ningbo (寧波), Fuzhou (福州), and Shanghai (上海), taking the first step in its aggression against China. As a result of the Treaty of Nanjing in 1842, which concluded the Opium War, the flood of British aggression against China rushed in like angry waves, instantly engulfing all of China. The anti-foreign fervor of the Chinese populace reached an extreme boiling point, eventually leading to the Taiping Rebellion (長髮賊之亂) of 1850. However, China's national strength followed a path of decline, and due to this rebellion, Britain established an even deeper foothold throughout China.\nFollowing this, the so-called \"Arrow\" incident served as the fuse for the Second Anglo-Chinese War, resulting in the signing of the Treaty of Tientsin, by which China opened five more ports including Niuzhuang (牛莊) and opened the Yangtze River (揚子江). In 1860, the Anglo-French allied forces started a war with China, and by the Treaty of Peking, China again opened Tianjin (天津) and ceded Kowloon (九龍) to Britain. Thus, as the years passed, Britain's encroachment on China expanded and strengthened. America, starting later than Britain, put up the golden signboard of \"Equal Opportunity\" and \"Open Door\" towards China, and together with Britain, began to exploit China economically while manipulating and trifling with its rulers, ultimately leading to the complete colonization and enslavement of China by the joint efforts of Britain and America. If the Chiang Kai-shek government truly wished for the salvation of China, it should properly expel the influence of these British and American powers that are eating away at their country from the marrow of its bones, cut off their traces from East Asia to save China and save East Asia. Yet, turning weapons against Japan, which is of the same script and race, striving body and soul for its own country and for East Asia, is truly incomprehensible. Chiang Kai-shek must bear in mind: the Japanese Empire is by no means China's enemy; it is a good neighbor<32> and friendly nation for saving China. China's true enemies are the wicked and cunning British and Americans. As long as Britain and America cannot be expelled from China, from East Asia, there will be no peace in East Asia, and consequently, the construction of the New East Asian Order is completely impossible. The China Incident is ostensibly a war with Chiang Kai-shek, but in reality, it is a war with Britain and America. The Empire has been fighting Britain and America hidden behind Chiang Kai-shek. Now, as of December 8th last, the Empire declared war on Britain and America. Unless we confront and crush them directly, the completion of the China Incident is unthinkable, and therefore, the construction of a New East Asia cannot be realized. Today's initiation of war against America and Britain is truly a Holy War to resolve the China Incident and build a new order in East Asia. Therefore, the Empire must, no matter what, crush Britain and America and achieve the great objective of constructing a New East Asia. The Empire has meanwhile perfected its wartime readiness system, and its one hundred million subjects are burning with the conviction of certain victory. Wherever the invincible Army, Navy, and Air Force deploy, the British and American forces will be utterly crushed.\nLooking back, the Peninsula (半島), spurred by the outbreak of the Manchurian Incident, showed a marked awakening as subjects of the Empire (皇國臣民). When the China Incident occurred, this awakening reached its peak, and countless contributions have been made from the home front (銃後奉公) during this period. Not only contributions from the home front, but there have even been brave soldiers who trained as volunteers, courageously deployed to the front lines, and fell as spirits protecting the nation (護國의 英靈), demonstrating that the patriotic fervor of the Peninsula is currently boiling at its highest point. Furthermore, the Peninsula serves as a continental supply base for the Empire's construction of the New East Asian Order and as the Empire's food base, supplying a significant portion of the Empire's wartime food needs. It also produces gold, silver, and numerous minerals essential for various military preparations, fulfilling its role as one wing of the wartime Empire.\nAll this is an expression of the patriotic sincerity of the 24 million people of the Peninsula who have awakened as subjects of the Empire. However, the time for the Peninsular populace to truly display their fervent patriotism has now arrived. Today's war with Britain and America is truly a momentous, decisive battle that will determine the fate of the Empire and East Asia. At this time, the people of the Peninsula must further solidify their iron unity, offer their bodies, materials, and labor, and strive to advance in service to the nation (國家奉公). If, at this time, there is anyone harboring even the slightest trace of past Anglo-American liberalistic thought, causing disruption to the fervent sincerity of the people's patriotic spirit, this must not happen. We must sternly and coolly reject such anti-national, anti-situational thoughts and actions, and moreover, endure all hardships and deficiencies, look towards the future brightness, unite as one, and strive to break through the national crisis. (Applause) <33>\n\n**The Time for Our Uprising**\nHasanyama Shigeru (Former name Cho Pyŏng-sang)\n\nOn December 8th last, Our Empire drew the sword of justice to rescue the East, which had been under the exploitation and oppression of America and Britain. 641 years ago from now, India was indeed a nation with a splendid culture. But after Britain took India, they degraded the nation's culture, made no effort towards educational improvement, and for 300 years only focused on exploiting resources and their labor. Thus, they abandoned the Indian people and merely engaged in acts of severe thievery.\nNot only that, Britain left the greatest stain on human history with an event called the Opium War. As you well know, this Opium War involved cultivating opium in India, bringing it to China for sale, causing the Chinese nation to become decadent and weak, and finally pushing them into the pit of destruction – weaving the greatest history of crime against humanity. At that time, Commissioner Lin Zexu (林則徐總督), who lamented this most painfully, opposed the import of opium, but because Britain would not listen, he had no choice but to set fire to merchant ships loaded with 20,000 catties (斤) of opium. Enraged by this, Britain sent warships, forced Commissioner Lin Zexu to surrender through military might, and seized Hong Kong as reparations.\nThus, Britain used Hong Kong as its greatest base for exploiting the East for a century. Now, this Hong Kong is under the siege of our Imperial Army (皇軍), and its fall is a matter of time. In the near future, when this Hong Kong falls to our Imperial Army, it will be the first victory in making the East the East of the East Asians. Surely, Commissioner Lin Zexu in the underworld will dance upon receiving this joyous news.\nThose British and Americans established concessions (租界) not only in Malaya, French Indochina, and Hong Kong but also in Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, and other places, piling exploitation upon exploitation.<34> If those Anglo-Saxons had come to the East because they had no place to live and nothing to eat, perhaps there might be some point to forgive. But they, possessing vast territories and abundant resources, crawled into the East out of further greed, taking away even what East Asians needed to eat and wear. This is truly malice beyond necessity, hence not for securing livelihood but greed for luxury. For their luxury, the peoples of the East have long suffered groans and endured invasion.\n\nNow let us look at the history of America's crimes. America supported Japan during the Russo-Japanese War, but it was not for Japan's sake; it was out of other greed. What was it? A man named Harriman from the US government came with over 30 subordinates, wanting to exchange money for the South Manchuria Railway, which the Imperial Army had acquired by shedding blood. America, thinking Japan would surely agree to exchange it for money, seizing the opportunity of the economic difficulties following the Russo-Japanese War, began to oppose Japan from that time because the deal failed. And America, jealous of Japan becoming a strong power and rising to a leading position in the East, thinking that eliminating Japan from the East would solve the problem, caused various obstructions to Our Empire in many aspects. Recently, they created the so-called ABCD Encirclement, applying pressure economically, politically, and militarily.\nThe morality and peace they constantly cry about are just words. In reality, they have despised and treated the one billion people of the East as slaves, making them objects of exploitation. Truly, because of them, there has been no development for the one billion people of the East. They have only been sucked dry. At this, the Empire rose up resolutely, saying, \"Stop sucking us dry! Spit out what you have sucked up until now! We will strike a blow so you can never suck again!\" Under this intention, we drew the sword in the current Great East Asia Holy War.\nThis war on the Pacific Ocean is truly a Holy War to rescue us East Asians from the exploitation of the atrocious America and Britain. It is time for us, the people, to resolutely rise up (蹶起). The one hundred million of the Imperial Army are the vanguard, next is Manchuria, next is awakened China, next is Thailand. Thus, the one billion people of East Asia must become one mass to strike and shatter the power of Britain and America, driving them out of the lands of the East. In this, Manchuria shares the same intention, awakened China also does so, and Thailand also shares the same intention, agreeing to the Imperial Army's advance into Thai territory and joint defense. This is truly joyous, and I think this is also a point where the same blood of the East connects. When the blood of the East<35> binds together and cooperates in unity, there is nothing to fear and nothing that cannot be smashed.\nBut look! The Imperial Army alone, within three days of the war's start, has already smashed Britain's main fleet, and you must have all seen in the extras that they even smashed America's main fleet at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. This is because Our Country stood up for justice, so God was with us. The fierce fighting of the loyal, brave, and invincible Imperial Army is one thing, but God also helps in a fight for justice. In fact, Our Country has never yet taken up arms for aggression. Punishment is delivered by heaven. That is why the British and American fleets received punishment on the Pacific Ocean. That is, the help of God is bound to the righteous uprising (蹶起), causing the Imperial Army to win victory after victory.\nThis afternoon, at a certain gathering, Governor-General Minami stated, \"In any war, the side that wins at the beginning wins until the end.\" I believe this is the truth.\nConfident that our forces, having won at the beginning, will win until the end, we must all rise up together (궐기) and, facing Britain and America, warn them, \"Stop sucking! Spit out what you have already sucked! You must not suck again!\" and resolutely overthrow the power of Britain and America. (Applause) <36>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis article compiles five speeches delivered by prominent Korean figures (Yun Ch'i-ho, Chang Tŏk-su, Sin Hŭng-u, Yi Sŏng-gŭn/Kim Ch'ŏn-sŏng, Cho Pyŏng-sang/Hasanyama Shigeru) at a rally in Seoul on December 10, 1941, just after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. The speakers vehemently denounce the United States and Great Britain as hypocritical, exploitative powers responsible for centuries of Asian suffering and for obstructing Japan's \"holy mission\" to establish a \"New East Asian Order.\" They frame the Pacific War as a righteous \"Holy War\" for Asian liberation led by Japan. The speeches urge the Korean people (referred to as \"Peninsula populace\") to fully support Japan's war effort through unwavering loyalty, material sacrifice, labor mobilization (國民皆勞運動), and volunteering for the military (지원병제도), emphasizing the ideology of \"Japan and Korea as One Body\" (內鮮一體) and warning against any dissent or lingering Western ideas.\n\nFor historians, this text is a stark example of pro-Japanese propaganda delivered by influential Korean collaborators during the height of wartime mobilization. It reveals the narratives used to justify Japanese imperialism and rally Korean support, portraying the war against the Allies as an anti-colonial struggle while simultaneously demanding total subservience to the Japanese Empire. The speeches by figures like Yun Ch'i-ho, known for earlier nationalist leanings, are particularly revealing about the complex pressures and choices faced by Korean elites under colonial rule, and the extent to which some embraced or were compelled to publicly endorse Japan's wartime ideology. The specific arguments used—denouncing Anglo-American racism and hypocrisy (citing examples like segregation, slavery, the Opium War), praising Japan's mission, and urging Koreans to prove their loyalty through sacrifice—highlight the rhetorical strategies employed by the colonial regime and its collaborators.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n大東亞\t대동아\tTae Tong-a (Greater East Asia)\n半島\t반도\tPando (Korean Peninsula)\n美國\t미국\tMiguk (United States of America)\n英國\t영국\tYŏngguk (Great Britain)\n帝國\t제국\tCheguk (Japanese Empire)\n東亞 共榮圈\t동아 공영권\tTong-a Kongyŏngkwŏn (East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere)\n皇軍\t황군\tHwanggung (Imperial Army)\n太平洋\t태평양\tT'aep'yŏngyang (Pacific Ocean)\n香港\t홍콩\tHong Kong\n比律濱\t비율빈\tPiryulbin (Philippines)\n馬來\t마래\tMarae (Malaya)\n新嘉坡\t신가파\tSin'gap'a (Singapore)\n보르네오\t보르네오\tBorneo\n國民總力聯盟\t국민총력연맹\tKungmin Ch'ongnyŏk Yŏnmaeng (National General Mobilization League)\n尹致昊\t윤치호\tYun Ch'i-ho\n伊東致昊\t이토 치호\tItō Chihō (Japanese reading for Yun Ch'i-ho)\n張德秀\t장덕수\tChang Tŏk-su\n申興雨\t신흥우\tSin Hŭng-u\n高靈興雨\t고령 흥우\tKoryŏng Hŭng-u (Clan name + Sin Hŭng-u)\n金川聖\t김천성\tKim Ch'ŏn-sŏng (Adopted Japanese-style name)\n李聖根\t이성근\tYi Sŏng-gŭn (Original Korean name of Kim Ch'ŏn-sŏng)\n曺秉相\t조병상\tCho Pyŏng-sang\n夏山茂\t하산무\tHasanyama Shigeru (Adopted Japanese-style name for Cho Pyŏng-sang)\n上海\t상해\tShanghai\n蘇州河\t소주하\tSojoha (Suzhou River)\n中國人\t중국인\tChunggugin (Chinese person)\n加奈陀\t가나타\tKanat'a (Canada)\n滿洲事變\t만주사변\tManju Sabyŏn (Manchurian Incident)\n支那事變\t지나사변\tChina Sabyŏn (China Incident)\n東洋\t동양\tTong'yang (The East/Orient)\n東鄕大將\t도고 대장\tTōgō Taishō (Admiral Tōgō)\n對馬島海峽\t대마도해협\tTaemado Haehyŏp (Tsushima Strait)\n內地\t내지\tNaeji (Mainland Japan)\n大和民族\t대화민족\tTaehwa Minjok (Yamato people/race)\n皇室\t황실\tHwangsil (Imperial Household)\n東大門\t동대문\tTongdaemun (East Gate of Seoul)\n支那\t지나\tChina (Derogatory term used by Japan)\n蘭印\t난인\tNanin (Dutch East Indies)\n佛蘭西\t불란서\tPullansŏ (France)\n獨逸\t독일\tTogil (Germany)\n伊太利\t이태리\tIt'aeri (Italy)\n蘇聯\t소련\tSoryŏn (Soviet Union)\n南米\t남미\tNammi (South America)\n뉴-욕\t뉴욕\tNew York\n부로오드ㆍ웨이\t브로드웨이\tBroadway\n오레곤 大學\t오리건 대학\tOregon Taehak (University of Oregon)\n엘리자베스 女王\t엘리자베스 여왕\tElizabeth Yŏwang (Queen Elizabeth)\n드렉\t드레이크\tDrake (Sir Francis Drake)\n쉑스피아\t셰익스피어\tShakespeare\n亞弗利加\t아프리카\tAp'ŭrik'a (Africa)\n리바-푸울\t리버풀\tLiverpool\n印度\t인도\tIndo (India)\n皇道\t황도\tHwangdo (Imperial Way)\n아담ㆍ스밑\t애덤 스미스\tAdam Smith\n킾풀링\t키플링\tKipling (Rudyard Kipling)\n濠洲\t호주\tHoju (Australia)\n新西蘭\t신서란\tSinsŏran (New Zealand)\n南亞弗利加\t남아프리카\tNam Ap'ŭrik'a (South Africa)\n緬絢\t면현\tMyŏnhyŏn (Burma)\n威海衛\t위해위\tWihaewi (Weihaiwei)\n꾸암\t괌\tGuam\n웨익 諸島\t웨이크 제도\tWake Chedo (Wake Islands)\n파리 講和會議\t파리 강화회의\tP'ari Kanghwa Hoeŭi (Paris Peace Conference)\n馬尼剌\t마닐라\tManilla (Manila)\n眞珠灣\t진주만\tChinjuman (Pearl Harbor)\n每日新報\t매일신보\tMaeil Sinbo (Newspaper name)\n野村 大使\t노무라 대사\tNomura Taesa (Ambassador Nomura)\n來栖 大使\t구루스 대사\tKurusu Taesa (Ambassador Kurusu)\n日淸\t일청\tIl-Ch'ŏng (Sino-Japanese)\n日露\t일로\tIl-Ro (Russo-Japanese)\n露西亞\t노서아\tNosŏa (Russia)\n滿洲\t만주\tManju (Manchuria)\n하리만\t해리먼\tHarriman (E.

ABCD진영의 그 외의 국가들과 또 장래 米國을 추종하리라고 불 수 있는 南米의 諸 小國家와 같은 것은 그야말로 凱袖一觸, 족히 掛論할 것도 못되는 것임니다.\n\n二. 그러면 日本의 적성국가로서의 英米의 정체는 어떠한가. 여러분이 잘 아시는 바와 같이  英米는 모다 세계최대의 當를 자랑하는 富國이외다.＜24＞세계최대의 해군을 자랑하는 강국\n이외다. 그러나 나는 이제 그 富强의 실상여부를 논의코자 하지 안슴니다. 원래 英米가 제국의 적성국가가 되는 것은 그들이 부강한 까닭이 아니라, 그 부강을 의지하야 東亞의 신질서, 나아가서는 세계의 新秩序建設을 방해하는 구 세력이 있는 때문이니 나는 차라리 英米문명의 근본이데올로기를 검토하야 그 정체를 이 방면으로부터 폭로하고자 함니다.\n\n三. 첫째, 英米는 예수敎國이라고 칭하고 있지만은 예수敎國이 안임니다. 그와 반대의 강권국가임니다. 예수의 사랑우에 나라를 세우고 그 도의에 의하야 행동을 규정하는 예수敎國이 아니라 한갓 世欲에 의하야 강력 우에선 權力國家임니다.\n이것은 너무도 명백한 사실이여서 예증을 들 것까지도 없지만은 英米에 가서 친히 聞見한 一端을 드러 여러분께 참고로 드리고자 함니다.\n예수敎國이라고 자처하는 米國에 원래 노예와 같은 비인도적 문제가 존재할 리가 없겠지만 지금으로부터 약 80年前에 흑인노예의 문제로서 4年동안이나 悲風慘雨의 南北戰爭이 있었든 것은 여러분이 잘 아시는 바 임니다. 아니 흑인의 虐待問題는 오늘날에도 오히려 해결되지 못한 사회문제의 중대한 일부면임니다.\n일례를 들면 하로는 뉴-욕의 종로라고 할만한 「부로오드ㆍ웨이」의 한 식당에 점심을 먹으려 갓섯음니다. 음식의 주문을 마치고 안젔노라니까 한 4, 50 되여 보이는 점잔은 흑인 한 사람이 드러와서 역시 점심을 사먹으랴는지 손에 드럿든 「가방」을 옆에 놋고 식탁을 의지하야 안젓슴니다. 얼마있다가 그 식당주인이 그 사람에게 가서 무어라고 몃 마듸를 속살거린즉 그 흑인은 얼골에 분기를 띄고 자리를 차고 나아감니다. 하도 이상해서 그 주인을 불러 사유를 무른즉 그 대답이 우리 집에서는 흑인에게 음식을 팔지 안슴니다 함니다. 웨, 흑인의 돈에는 「녹」이 쓸었드냐 한즉 흑인에게 음식을 팔면 백인 손님들이 오지를 안는다고요. 다음으로 내가 친히 당한 이야기를 하나 하겠음니다.\n오레곤 대학에 있을 때에 그 洞里 어떠한 이발소에 이발을 하라갓음니다. 그런즉 그 집주인이 하는 말이 우리는 동양사람의 머리는 깍지 안는다고. 웨 동양사람의 머리털은 쇠사실인줄 아느냐 한즉 하여튼 동양사람의 머리는 안 깍는다는데 무슨 잔소리냐 해서 할 수 없이 대학 안으로 도라와서 이발을 한 경험이 있음니다.\n하나님 나라에는 色의 구별도 없고 性의 구별도 없다는데 예수敎國이라고 자처하는 米國에는 이와 같이 有色人種에 대한 차별이 심함니다.\n英國은 어떠함니가. 천하의 紳士國으로＜25＞ 自任하는 英國은 阿片과 같은 비인도적 상품을 팔 리가 없을 것 같지만은 사실은 그 阿片을 팔기 위하야 한 100年 前에 支那와 阿片戰爭을 한 것은 여러분의 기억에도 새로울 줄 암니다.\n나는 그보다도 더한층 慘酷한 이야기를 하나 하겠음니다.\n「엘리자베스」여왕시대라면 영국역사에는 꽃으로 치는 시대임니다. 「드렉」과 같은 名將도 그 때에 낫고 「쉑스피아」와 같은 詩聖도 그 때에 낫음니다. 이러한 이를테면 名君聖朝人때에 한 勅令이 나렸음니다. 그것은 英國사람에게 노예를 무역하는 특권을 허락한 것임니다. 그 문구의 대의는 이러함니다. 「영국사람은 누구나 총과 칼을 들고 亞弗利加의 촌락을 襲擊하야 붓잡히는 흑인은 男女老幼를 물론하고 모다 노예로 팔 수 있다」하는 것임니다. 다시 말하면 사람도적질을 공연하게 국법으로서 英國사람의 특권으로 허락한 것임니다. 이 소위 특권에 의지하야 조직된 遠征隊의 첫 배이름이 무었이냐 하면 「예수」 Jesus라는 배였음니다. 오늘날 英國의 유명한 항구의 하나인 「리바-푸울」과 같은 항구는 이러한 노예의 무역으로써 살진 항구임니다.\n英米의 역사를 훌터보면 그 富强의 배후에는 이러한 노예의 억울한 눈물과 분한 피가 뛰고 있음니다. 이러한 나라를 道義의 문명국이라고 할 수 있음니가. (拍手)\n\n四. 둘째, 英米는 自由主義ㆍ個人主義의 나라라고 함니다. 그러나 사람도적질을 공연히 허락하는 전통을 가진 나라가 참으로 개인의 존엄을 늣기는 個人主義를 세울 수가 있으며 인격의 자유를 존중하는 自由主義를 엿볼 수가 있음니가. 대개 사람의 가치를 무시하고는 도덕의 터를 닦을 수가 없고 도덕의 터가 문어진 곳에 個人主義나 自由主義의 집을 세울 수는 없음니다. 英米의 個人主義는 결국 利己主義이오 自由主義는 放恣主義에 불과한 젓임니다. 다시 말하면 天理가 끈어진 곳에 私欲만이 춤을 추는 젓이 英米의 個人主義이오 自由主義임니다. 그리고 이와 같은 토대우에 과학으로 싸아 노은 것이 곧 이른바 産業主義임니다.\n이러한 「이데올로기」우에 선 英米사회에서는 그럼으로 노동자는 일개 사람이라기 보다도 몬저 생산의 수단이오 자본가는 일개 국민이라기 보다도 몬저 자본가임니다. 이와 같은 자본가와 노동자가 서로 교환가치의 관계에 서서 이익을 다토는 것이 英米의 사회조직임니다. 거기에는 이해도 없고 동정도 없고 다만 利害狡計가＜26＞ 있을 뿐임니다. 강한 자는 살고 약한 자는 죽을 것 뿐임니다. 弱肉强食하는 동물사회에 무슨 自由主義ㆍ個人主義가 있을 리가 있음니다.

(拍手)＜29＞\n\n新東亞建設과 朝鮮\n每日新報社長 金川聖(舊名 李聖根)\n\n지난 12월 8일은 我等에게 있어서 영원히 잊을 수 없는, 기념할 날이다. 사실은 지난 2월 8일부터 日米간의 사태의 긴박과 위기를 전하고 있었는데, 당시 野村大使를 派遺하여 日米交涉을 진행시켜 왔으며, 다시 來栖大使의 派遺까지 보게 되였으나 頑迷한 米國의 태도로 평화와 정의를 旗帳로 하는 제국의 의견을 도저히 받아들이지 않을 것으로 우리 一億동포의 예감에도 짐작되여, 日本間에 戰火가 벌어질 날이 내일이냐 모레냐 하고 대포소리가 터질 것만 기다려 젔었습니다. 그러나 7일 밤까지도 몰랐던 이번 전쟁은 8일 未明에 이르러서야 비로소 砲門을 열게 되였으며, 이 宣戰의 號外로 접할 때 滿場의 여러분도 응당 환희에 가슴이 터질 듯 했었을 것이라 생각합니다. 無論, 누구나 싸움을 싫여하는 것은 인생의 철학상 공통된 심리이겠으므로 우리 帝國 역시 전쟁을 즐기고 사람을 죽이기를 기뻐하는 것은 결코 아닙니다. 단지 新東亞建設을 위해서, 한 걸음 더 나아가서는 인류의 평화와 행복을 위해서 不得己 정의의 검을 빼여들게 되였습니다. 즉, 惶恐하옵게도 지난 8일 對英米宣戰布告에 관하야 漁發하옵신 大詔에\n「東亞의 안정을 확보하야서 세계평화에 기여함은 丕顯한 皇祖考丕承한 皇考의 作述한 遠猷이어서 朕이 奉奉不措하는 바이다」\n라고 말슴하신 것과 가치 東亞에 신질서를 건설하야 東亞의 안정을 확보함으로서 세계평화에 기여하고자 하는 것은 실로 우리 나라 皇祖皇宗으로부터서의 遠大하옵신 御抱負, 御經論이옵시며, 따라서 我國不動의 國是입니다. 그러므로 明治시대에 이러난 日淸 日露의 두 전쟁은 東亞의 영원한 평화를 확립하기 위한 帝國의 聖戰이 序幕이었으니, 특히 日露戰爭은 東亞에 뻐치는 백인 露西亞의 세력을 구축하기 위한 東亞新秩序建設이 첫 烽火이었습니다. 이리하야 帝國은 日露戰爭에서＜30＞ 未曾有의 대승을 博하야 滿洲에서 露西亞의 세력을 一掃하였고, 뒤이어서 露西亞 대신으로 다시 滿洲에 魔手를 뻐칠냐고 하는 米國의 음모를 一蹴하였습니다. 日露戰爭 후, 米國의 鐵道王 「하리만」은 南滿洲 철도사회를 日米共同管理로서 경영할 것을 제안하야 이에 관한 당시 我國政府와의 가조약이 성립되여 幾多將兵의 피를 흘리여 있든 滿洲의 권익이 다시 米國의 손으로 드러가고, 이리하야 우리 나라의 대륙경영의 好機가 미국의 好餌가 될냐고 할 때에, 小村外相의 强硬한 반대로 말미아마 이 米國의 야망은 드디여 완전히 좌절되여 버렸습니다. 小村外相 이야말로 東亞新秩序建設을 明治시대에 있어서 벌서 計劃하고 企圖한 위대한 정치가입니다. 이 小村外相의 반대가 없었드라면 滿洲는 米國의 식민지가 되여 지금쯤은 東亞의 사태가 어떻게 되였을 ** ******.\n이렇게 日露戰爭을 치른 뒤 我國은 점차로 大陸經營의 地盤을 가다듬어 갔으니 昭和 6년 9월에 勃發한 滿洲事變은 帝國이 日露戰爭에서 착수한 東亞新秩序建設運動을 구체적으로 전개시킨 획기적 사건이 있습니다. 당시 滿洲에 蟠居한 張學良政權은 중앙의 蔣介石政府와 또 이를 操의하는 英米의 세력을 먹고 가끔 帝國의 위신을 손상시키는 행동을 자행하기에 이르렀습니다. 그럴 때마다 帝國의 穩忍自重, 張學良政權의 반성을 促하야 왔습니다마는 그러나 인내에도 한도가 있는 것으로 帝國은 드디여 결연히 이러나  輕躁浮薄한 張學良政權을 물니치고 滿洲 3천만민중의 總意에 조차 淸朝의 후예를 모시여 滿洲國을 새로 건국하였습니다. 滿洲國은 실로 東亞에 있어서 民族協和, 王道樂土를 이상으로 하는 道義的 국가입니다.\n軍閥의 虐政을 一掃하고 東亞에 樂土를 맨들었습에 불구하고 蔣介石政權은 滿洲國의 성립을 또 끝내 부정하야 왔고 특히 米國은 滿洲事變 勃發초부터 九個國條約을 방패로 내세워 백만으로 滿洲國건설을 비방하였습니다.\n英國도 米國에 지지하게 날뛰여 英米가 결탁하야 가지고 國際聯盟을 움지기여 滿洲國을 부¸하였습니다.\n그 뒤 蔣介石은 국민의 전력을 排日에 집중시키고 傾注시키여 있었을 적마다 帝國에 不遜을 거듭하야 사태가 不穩을 極하야왔고, 이리하야 드디여 昭和 11年 蘆溝橋의 一發銃聲이 支那事變을 이르키기에 이르렀습니다. 事變勃發當初 帝國의 不擴大方針에 불구하고 蔣介石政權은 英米의 세력을 믿고 무모한 抗日을 계속하야 사변은 드디여 收拾할 수 없이 크게 버러젔습니다. 그 동안 帝國의 무적 陸海空軍은 敢行하야＜31＞ 蔣介石은 드디여 一小地方政權으로 몰락하야 瀕死의 지경에 허덕어리고, 南京에는 反共和平을 종지로 한 親日의 新生國民正統政府가 탄생하야 帝國과 긴밀한 연락아래에 新生支那의 건설, 나아가 新東亞建設에 邁進하고 있습니다.\n그러나 어듸까지든지 東亞를 노예상태에 두어 搾取와 압박을 마음대로 하랴는 米國과 英國은 사변의 장기화를 꾀하야 노골적으로 또 執拗하게 蔣政權을 원조하야 帝國과 항전을 계속시키고 있습니다. 支那事變의 完遂를 방해하고, 東亞의 新秩序建設을 阻止하는 것은 진실로 英米 두 나라입니다.\n英米 두 나라는 19세기의 中葉부터 서로 전후하야 東亞 특히 支那에 魔手로 뻐치여 支那를 그들의 반식민지로 맨든 凶暴邪雲한 국가입니다.\n英國은 印度를 잠식한 뒤에 그 毒牙를 支那에 뻐치여 1839년에 유명한 阿片戰爭을 이르키여 香港을 뺏고, 廣東, 履門, 寧波, 福州, 上海등 5港을 개항시키여 支那침략의 第一步를 내듸듸였습니다. 이리하야 阿片戰爭을 결말지은 1842년의 南京條約의 결과로 英國의 對支侵略의 홍수는 怒濤가치 몰녀들어 순식간에 全支那를 석권함에 이르러, 支那民衆이 排外熱은 극도로 沸騰되여 드듸여 1850년의 長髮賊의 亂을 보게되였습니다. 그러나 支那의 국력은 衰弱의 一路를 밟어 이 亂으로 말미아마 英國은 더욱더 깊은 근거를 支那 全土에 밖에 되였습니다.\n이 뒤에 所謂 「애로」사건을 導火線으로 하야 第二次英支戰爭이 버러지여 天津條約이 체결됨으로 지나는 牛莊外 5港을 다시 개항하고, 揚子江을 개방하였으며 1860년에는 英佛聯合軍이 支那와 開戰하야 支那는 北京條約으로 다시 天津을 개항하고 九龍을 英國에 割讓하게 되였습니다. 이리하야 해가 갈수록 英國의 支那蠶食은 擴大强化되였고, 英國보다 느께 출발한 米國은 支那에 대하야 機會均等, 門戶開放이라는 金看板을 내세워 가지고 英國과 함께 支那의 집정자를 操縱弄絡하면서 經濟的으로 착취하기 시작하야 英米합동으로 支那를 완전히 식민지화, 노예화함에 이르렀습니다. 蔣介石정부가 진실로 支那의 救國을 위할진댄 모름직이 이 가치 자기나라를 뼈꼴로부터 파먹어 드러가는 英米양국의 세력을 구축하야 東亞에서 그들의 발자취를 끈어 支那를 구하고, 東亞를 구하여야 하겠거를, 자국을 위하야, 그리고 東亞를 위하야 粉骨碎身하는 同文同種의 日本에게 향하야 干戈를 들어 적대하는 것은 실로 不可解의 일이라 하지 안을 수 없습니다. 蔣介石은 銘記하여야 할 것이니 日本帝國은 결코 支那의 적이 아니다, 支那를 구하기 위한 善隣이요＜32＞ 友邦이며, 支那의 진정한 적은 凶雲하고 狡猾한 英米인 것입니다. 英米를 支那에서, 東亞에서 驅逐하지 못하는 한 , 東亞에 평화는 없고 따라서 東亞新秩建設은 완전히 불가능합니다. 支那事變은 겉으로는 蔣介石과의 전쟁이지만 실은 英米와의 전쟁이어서 帝國은 蔣介石의 뒤에 숨은 英米와 싸홈하야 왔거니와 이제 지난 12월 8일로서 帝國은 英米에 宣戰하야 정면으로 이를 격파하지 안는 한 支那事變의 完遂는 생각할 수 없고 따라서 新東亞建設은 실현할 수 없으니 오늘날의 米苊�에 대한 개전은 실로 支那事變을 해결하고 東亞에 신질서를 건설하기 위한 聖戰입니다. 그러므로 帝國은 어떠한 일이 있드라도 英米를 격파하야 新東亞建設의 대 목적을 달성하지 안으면 안됩니다. 帝國은 그 동안 완벽의 臨戰體制를 정비하였고 一億臣民이 필승의 신념에 불타고 있으니 무적의 陸海空軍이 출동하는 곳에 英米軍은 여지없이 분쇄될 것입니다.\n도라다 보건대 半島는 滿洲事變의 勃發을 계기로 하야 皇國臣民으로서의 자각이 현저하야왔고, 支那事變이 이러낮다. 皇國臣民으로서의 자각이 고조에 달하야 그 동안 헤아릴 수 없는 銃後奉公을 다하야 왔습니다. 銃後奉公 뿐만 아니라 지원병으로 수련을 닥고 第一線에 勇躍出動하야 호국의 영령으로 散華한 용사까지 있게되여 半島의 愛國熱은 바야흐로 최고도로 沸騰되여 있습니다. 그 뿐만 아니라 半島는 帝國의 東亞新秩序建設상 대륙의 병참기지이며 제국의 식량기지로서 제국의 전시식량을 相當하고있고, 金銀基地諸種의 軍備上 필수의 鑛物多數히 산출하야 戰時帝國의 一翼으로서 역할을 다하고 있습니다.\n이것은 모다 皇國臣民으로서 자각한 半島 2천 4백만 민중의 애국지성의 발로이지만 그러나 진실로 半島民衆이 순국열정을 발휘할 때는 이제 닥처왔습니다. 오늘날의 英米와의 전쟁이야말로 帝國과 東亞의 운명을 결정할 중대한 결전입니다. 이 때를 당하야 半島民衆은 더욱 鐵石의 단결을 굳게 하고 육신과 물자와 노력을 바치여 國家奉公에 邁進하기를 기하여야 합니다. 만일 이 때에 조금이라도 往平의 英米類의 자유주의적 색채의 사상을 包懷하는 자가 있어서 민중의 애국지성에 奔馳하는 赤誠을 攪亂시키는 일이 있어서는 안됩니다. 우리는 儼然히 또는 冷然히 이 같은 反國家的, 反時局的 사상과 행동을 배격하는 것은 물론이어니와, 나아가 모든 艱難과 결핍을 참고 견듸여 장래의 광명을 바라보면서 일치단결하야 國難突破에 邁進하지 안으면 안됩니다. (拍手)＜33＞\n\n我等蹶起의 秋\n夏山茂(舊名 曹秉相)\n\n지난 12월 8일, 我帝國은 米英의 搾取와 壓迫밑에 있던 동양을 구출하기 위하여 정의의 검을 빼여들게 되였음니다. 지금으로부터 641년前 印度는 실로 찬란한 문화를 가진 민족이였으나 英國이 印度를 빼앗아먹은 뒤로는 그 민족의 문화를 저하시키고 교육향상의 주력함이 없이 다만 300년間을 물자와 그들의 노력을 搾取하기에만 힘써왔던 것입니다. 이리하여 그들은 印度사람을 버렸고, 단지 심한 도적의 행위만을 일삼아 왔음니다.\n그 뿐만 아니라 英國은 인류역사에 가장 큰 오점을 남긴, 사실이 있으니 그것은 소위 阿片戰爭이라는 것입니다. 이 阿片戰爭은 여러분도 잘 아시는 바이지만 印度에다가 阿片을 재배해 가지고는 中國에 가지고 가서 판매하여 支那민족으로 하여금 퇴페하게 하고, 나약하게 하고 마지막에는 멸망의 구렁털이에 집어넣는 인류 최대의 罪惡史를 비져내였던 것임니다. 당시 이것을 가장 가슴 아프게 痛嘆한 林則徐總督이 阿片의 수입을 반대했으나 英國이 듯지많기 때문에 不得己 二萬斤의 阿片을 적재한 상선들에 불을 질렀음니다. 이것에 격분을 일으킨 英國은 군함을 보내여 무력으로써 林則徐總督을 降服시키고 손해배상으로 香港을 빼앗었던 것이외다.\n이리하여 英國은 香港을 동양착취의 최대 기지로써 일세기에 亙하여 사용해 왔었는데, 이 香港이 지금 우리 皇軍의 包圍하에 있어 陷落될 날이 시간문제에 달려있게 되였음니다. 이제 不遠한 장래에 이 香港이 우리 皇軍에 陷落되는 날이면 동양은 동양인의 동양이 되는 첫 승리가 될 것이니 응당에 지하에 있는 林則徐總督도 이 快消息을 접할 때 춤을 추것임니다.\n그들 英米人 등은 馬來, 佛印, 香港만이 아니라 上海, 北京, 天津 등 각지에 租界를 가지고 搾取에 搾取를 거듭해 왔던 것이외다. 만일 그들＜34＞ 앵글로색손족이 살 곳이 없고, 먹을 것이 없어서 동양에까지 왔었다면 혹 용서할 점도 있을지 모르나, 그들은 많은 영토와 많은 자원을 가지고도 더 욕심을 채우려고 동양에까지 기여들어서 동양인이 먹고 입어야 할 것까지 빼앗아 갔음니다. 이것이야말로 필요 이상의 악심이오, 따라서 生活保定이 아니라 豪華를 위한 탐욕인 것이외다. 이러한 그들의 호화를 위해서 동양민족은 오랫동안 呻吟을 해 왔었고 침략을 당해 왔었음니다.\n\n이제 우리는 또 米國의 罪惡史를 봅시다. 米國은, 日露戰爭때 日本을 찬성했었으나 그것은 日本을 위해서가 아니라 딴 욕심이 있어서 그리했던 것임니다. 그것은 무었인고 하니 皇軍이 피를 흘려서 획득한 南滿洲鐵道를 米國정부의 하리만손이라는 사람이 부하 30餘名을 데리고 와서 돈으로 바꾸자 했음니다. 日露戰爭뒤에 오는 경제의 곤란을 기회로 하여 돈을 바꾸자고 하면 으레이 바꿀 줄 알았던 米國은 그것이 성립되지 못했기 때문에 그 때부터 日本을 반대시하여 왔었던 것임니다. 그리고 日本이 강국이 되여가서 동양의 지도적 지위에 오르게 되는 것을 米國은 猜忌하여 동양에서 日本을 집어치우면 문제없다는 생각으로 우리 帝國에 여러 방면으로 방해를 끼쳐오다가 최근에에는 소위 ABCD包圍陣이라는 것을 만들어 가지고 經濟的으로, 혹은 政治的으로, 軍事的으로 압박을 가해 왔던 것이외다.\n그들이 항용 절규하는 바 道義와 평화는 말뿐이인 실제에 있어서는 10억의 동양인을 蔑視하고 노예시하여 왔던 것이며, 및 搾取의 대상을 삼아왔던 것이외다. 실로 그들 때문에 10억의 동양인의 발전은 없었음니다. 오직 빨리기만 했던 것이외다. 이에, 帝國은 분연히 일어나서 그만 빨리자, 이 때까지 빨리였던 것을 토해 내여 놓아라, 다시는 못 빨아 먹도록 일격을 가하자는 뜻 밑에서 今番 大東亞聖戰에 검을 빼여 들었음니다.\n이 太平洋上의 전쟁이야말로 我等 동양인을 저 포악해 米英의 搾取下에서 구출해내는 聖戰으로, 我等 국민은 단연 蹶起하여야할 때임니다. 一億의 皇軍이 前衛隊가 되고, 다음은 滿洲,  다음은 잠깐 支那, 다음은 泰國, 이리하여 十億의 동양민족은 한 뭉치가 되여서 英米의 세력을 처서 깨트리고, 동양의 천지에서 몰아내여야할 때임니다. 이에 있어서 滿洲가 뜻을 가치하고, 잠깬 支那가 또한 그렇고, 泰國이 또한 뜻을 가치하여 皇軍의 泰國國土進駐와 共同防衛에 협정한 것은 실로 기뿐 일이오, 이는 역시 동양의 같은 피가 서로 상통하는 점이라 생각함니다. 동양의 피가 한데＜35＞ 묵겨서 일치협력하는 때에는 무서울 것이 없고 못때려 부실 것이 없음니다.\n그런데 보십시오. 皇軍 혼자서 개전 삼일만에 벌써 英國의 주력함대를 깨트려 부셨고, 하와이 眞珠灣의 米國의 주력함대까지 때려부셨다는 것은 호외로 다 보셨을 것임니다. 이는 我國이 정의를 위해서 일어섰기 때문에 신이 함께 했던 것외이다. 忠勇無敵의 皇軍의 奮戰도 奮戰이지만 정의를 위한 싸움에는 신도 도와주는 것임니다. 사실상 我國은 아직까지 침략을 위해서 병기를 든 일은 없음니다. 벌은 하늘이 내리시는 것임니다. 그러기 때문에 英米함대는 太平洋上에서 벌을 발았음니다. 즉, 정의의 蹶起에 신의 도음이 묵겨서 皇軍은 연전연승케 되는 것임니다.\n오늘 낮에 某席上에서 南總督께서 말슴하시기를 「어떠한 전쟁에서든지 처음에 이기는 편이 끝까지 이긴다」 하셨는데 이는 진리라 생각함니다.\n처음에 이긴 아군은 끝까지 이길 것을 확신하고 我等은 다가치 궐기하여 英米를 향해서 「그만 빨아먹어라, 이미 빨아 먹었던 것을 내여 놓아라, 다시는 빨아먹어서는 안던다」 경고와 할께 단연코 英米의 세력을 타도하지 않아서는 안됨니다.(拍手)＜36＞\n＜18-36＞","magazine":"삼천리 제14권 제1호","date":"1942년 01월 01일 (January 1, 1942)","title":"The Greater East Asia War and the Armament of the Peninsula: Special Feature of Stenographic Records from the Decisive Battle Great Speeches"},{"path":"89_14.01_1942.01/040.txt","issue":"89_14.01_1942.01","content":"Transcription of the Great P'yŏngyang Speech Meeting on the Restoration of East Asia and the Annihilation of America and Britain\n\t\t\t\t\t\tP'yŏngyang Presbyterian Theological Seminary Principal Sagawa Hirachika (Former Name Ch'ae P'il-gŭn)\n\nFor several years, we have been hearing \"Extraordinary Times, Extraordinary Times,\" but the Extraordinary Times turned into the Times of Incident [referring to the Second Sino-Japanese War], and the Times of Incident have turned again into the Times of War. The Greater East Asia War began, with deepest reverence, on the 8th of last month with the issuance of the Imperial Rescript by His Majesty the Emperor. The resolve and determination of us, the people behind the gun line (銃後國民), must be redoubled. I worry if talking about myself first might be impolite. However, please indulge me for just one word. Since the outbreak of the China Incident, wishing to resemble, even just in clothing, the loyal and peerless Imperial Army active on the front lines, I bought and wore the National Uniform (國民服). With the outbreak of this Greater East Asia War, as a symbol of thinking of the Imperial Army fighting hard on the front lines, I yesterday shaved off the \"high-collar\" hairstyle I had kept for over 30 years. (Loud Laughter and Applause)\n\nThe issue I wish to speak about is the Restoration of East Asia. The Meiji Restoration was the restoration of the Great Japanese Empire, and the Shōwa Restoration is the restoration of Greater East Asia. The Greater East Asia Restoration of the sacred Shōwa era is based on the Meiji Restoration, and it can be said to be the ideal realization and the completing purpose of the Meiji Restoration. (Applause) Now, I will speak about the Restoration of East Asia divided into three aspects: past, present, and future.\n\n1. The Grave Illness of Past East Asia\n\nAbout 440 years ago, in Kōki 2158 (Western year 1498), the Portuguese Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route to India by circumnavigating Africa, and six years prior, in 2152 (1492), Columbus discovered the new continents of North and South America, after which the world underwent a transformation. The native peoples residing in Africa, North and South America, and Australia萎縮衰微 (withered and declined), while the white people of Europe rapidly expanded West, East, North, and South. Looking at Asia where we live, one-third of the north was occupied by Russia, <38> one-third of the southwest was trampled (蹂躪) by the nations of Britain, France, and Portugal, and the nearby islands of the southeast were occupied by the nations of Britain, France, America, and the Netherlands. Truly, the remaining East Asian nations came under siege from all sides. This is the encirclement line of A (America), B (Britain), C (Chiang), D (Dutch Indies), S (Russia, i.e., Soviet Union), just as they say. Doesn't the fact that Manchuria before the Manchurian Incident and China before the China Incident were, whether viewed economically or politically, all under their direction prove this? In any case, what does it say that our yellow race, which numbered 400 million 500 years ago, has now barely reached 700 million, while the white race, which was no more than 200 million, has now increased to over 1 billion? I believe it is our mission not to follow the path of the black and red races. (Applause)\n\nThough it's a well-known example, let me say a few words about the Opium War. It was exactly 100 years ago. It was the war between China and Britain that lasted for three years starting from Kōki 2500. Although the Portuguese had started selling opium in China before then, the British gradually began cultivating *** [text illegible/censored] in India and exporting opium to China. In the early Daoguang era, exports were 10,000 chests per year, but this increased month by month, exceeding 30,000 chests per year by the 13th year of Daoguang. With 120 catties (斤) per chest, how much money was plundered from the Chinese people in one year with 30,000 chests, and how many Chinese lives were destroyed? (Applause) At that time, the Governor-General of Huguang, Lin Zexu, after failing in negotiations to ban opium and being refused, out of indignation, forcefully took 20,000 chests of opium from British ships and burned them on the coast. It was momentarily satisfying. However, the following year, the cunning and malicious British government, under the pretext of obstructing trade, organized a China expeditionary fleet with 16 warships and 27 transport ships and attacked. China suffered successive defeats and surrendered in Kōki 2502 (1842) with the so-called Treaty of Nanking. The main points of the treaty were (1) payment of 21 million dollars in reparations, (2) opening of five ports: Guangdong, Shanghai, Ningbo, Fuzhou, and Xiamen, (3) cession of Hong Kong, and (5) imposition of a five-percent tariff on import/export goods. From this time, opium was imported into China almost without limit, and the Chinese people were robbed of their money, lost their capabilities, had their lives shortened, and their spirits exhausted. This great crime and immense evil of Britain cannot be atoned for by anything. Who is it that will strike down and expel this inhumane, heartless Britain? Who else but our Great Japanese Empire will raise the banner of justice and carry out the mandate of heaven? As Heaven's way revolves, the day when Hong Kong, ceded to the British 100 years ago, will be returned to the people of the East, the day when the Rising Sun flag flies over Hong Kong – will it be tomorrow? Or the day after tomorrow? As for Singapore and Burma, <39> will it be this week? Or next week? (Applause)\n\nLet me say a word about America. America is a country that spread Christianity in the East and established educational and medical institutions, bestowing considerable grace. But, on the other hand, how numerous are the traces of its encroachment on the East? Hawai'i was originally a place where Japanese people first entered, and even today, 160,000 people, nearly half of the total island population, live there. The native population of Hawai'i, the Kanaka people, initially numbered 300,000, but now only 20,000 remain. However, after the Americans transitioned the land from an independent kingdom to a democratic country, they had their own countrymen elected president, and 41 years ago, they completely annexed it. The Philippines, adjacent to Taiwan, a part of our Empire, was originally a Spanish possession, but it was seized 43 years ago through the Spanish-American War. Then, believing them to be stepping stones for their transportation and key defense locations, they successively took possession of Midway, Wake, Guam, and other islands. Guam is right in the middle of our Empire's mandate territory, the South Seas Mandate, yet they brazenly occupy it. It was an unfair arrangement stemming from racial discrimination that, while the German possessions among the South Seas Mandate islands should naturally have come under the Empire's mandate as a result of victory in the Japanese-German War [WWI], Britain snatched the northeastern part of the large island of New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago, America took Guam, and only the tiny, scattered islands were entrusted to our Empire's mandate. Isn't today the day to rectify this injustice? What do you all think? Surely, it is today, isn't it? (Applause)\n\n2. Recent East Asia's Sunbathing\n\n\"Light comes from the East\" (光自東方) is both a principle of Heaven (天理) and a historical slogan. Our Japanese Empire, since ancient times, has revered the Son of Heaven from the Land of the Rising Sun, hoisted the Rising Sun flag, risen in the East, and proclaimed Imperial authority and national power westward. Just as all planets and satellites in the solar system cannot exist without the sun, and all living beings and humans cannot live without it, so too must our Japanese Empire, as a divine nation (神國) and a nation of light (光國), realize the ideal of \"Eight Corners of the World Under One Roof\" (八紘一宇) and reconstruct the world. I have experience with P'yŏngyang's specialty, sunbathing, specifically sand bathing. When a medical doctor told me while sand bathing that the effect of ultraviolet rays was astonishing, I took sunbaths for over four years. (Loud Laughter and Applause) People made a fuss saying I got indigestion, skin diseases, and various other serious illnesses. I, too, confirm its effectiveness. I believe the grave illness of East Asia will be cured by sunbathing. Wherever the sunlight (日光) reaches, the grave illness will be cured, harmful germs (惡菌) will die, vitality (元氣) will be restored, and mind and body (心身) will become strong. Through the First Sino-Japanese War of Meiji 27-28, the Peninsula (半島) [Korea] began its sunbathing, and now it is developing into a strong body called \"Na선一體\" (Japan and Korea as One Body). Through the Russo-Japanese War of Meiji 37, <40> Manchuria began its sunbathing and saw a complete revival (蘇生) in the recent Manchurian Incident. Since the outbreak of the China Incident, the Nanjing Government centered around Mr. Wang Jingwei has been organized, and China, too, is undergoing sunbathing. Before long, the northwest part of China, still groaning under the Chiang regime which suffers from malignant germs and toxic diseases (惡菌毒疾), must also receive sunbathing. Is there anyone who still doubts the great efficacy of sunbathing, ladies and gentlemen? (Applause)\n\nOn this day, having bombed Hawai'i and achieved astonishing results, dared an amphibious landing in the Philippines, landed also on the Malay Peninsula and Borneo, attacked Hong Kong, and occupied Guam, what must be the state of mind of His Excellency Roosevelt? (Loud Laughter and Applause) Why did he break his country's longstanding precedent and run for president a third time, only to commit this blunder? Why did he ignore his country's traditional policy, abandon the Monroe Doctrine, and interfere in East Asian affairs, only to suffer this disgrace? Did he think that because Ambassador Nomura negotiated and Ambassador Kurusu also negotiated, we lacked strength and military preparedness and would submit? Did he not know that our Empire is not that kind of Empire? He puffed out his chest and stubbornly refused, they say. Yet, despite that, he couldn't even manage security in Hawai'i, losing five warships and burying over 3,000 warriors in a single bombing raid – truly quite \"loose\" (「루즈」), matching his name [Roosevelt sounds like \"loose belt\"]. (Loud Laughter and Applause) Truly, for such cold and detestable words and actions, a sharp needle to the crown of the head (頂門一針) is appropriate. \"A sharp needle to the crown of the head\" is a mistake. \"A thunderbolt from a clear blue sky\" (靑天霹靂) is more fitting.\n\nPeaceful advance into French Indochina was carried out long ago, and the Japan-Thailand Mutual Defense Pact was concluded simultaneously with the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, so the entire southeastern part of Asia is rapidly undergoing sunbathing. Landings are successively occurring in the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, British territories, and Portuguese territories, and they too are undergoing sunbathing. It's not just East Asia. Consider the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy. The guiding principle of German Nazism adopted Japan's ideology centered on the Imperial Household, and the 卍 on the German flag is the swastika (스바스티카) of humanity, the Chinese character 萬 (man), adopting Eastern thought. While it's not untrue that our <41> Empire has borrowed from German culture and German organization, it is as clear as day (明若觀火) that the fundamental principles of Germany's rebirth were learned from our East, from our Japan. In this sense, I believe that the New Order, the New System in Europe is also being achieved through sunbathing. (Applause)\n\n3. The Future Co-Prosperity Sphere of East Asia\n\nThe Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, for the time being, refers to the inclusion of Japan, Manchuria, China, French Indochina, Thailand, Burma, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and others. The Philippines is a great archipelago consisting of 7,083 large and small islands, with an area almost one and a half times that of our Peninsula. The largest island among them is Luzon (呂宋), famous for producing Luzon cigars, and the capital, Manila, is located there. The Imperial Army has already carried out an amphibious landing not far from Manila. The Dutch East Indies is a great archipelago of over ten thousand islands, consisting of the Greater Sunda Islands such as Sumatra, Java, southern Borneo, western New Guinea, Celebes, etc., and the Lesser Sunda Islands beyond. Its area is approximately 2 million square kilometers (平方粁), almost 10 times that of our Peninsula. The entire Dutch East Indies has an area more than 58 times larger than its mother country, Holland. Yet, the population living there is altogether less than 70 million. Among these, over 40 million people reside on the small island of Java. This means that in the area outside Java, which is 9 times larger than our Peninsula, only about 20 million people live. In other words, it is desolate and vast wilderness (荒厚曠野). However, in terms of production, it is the world's treasure house. No, it is the heaven-endowed treasure house (天賦寶庫) of Greater East Asia. Looking only at the major goods exported abroad from the Dutch East Indies the year before last, it is truly astonishing. 8 million tons (噸) of oil, 2 million tons of sugar, 300,000 tons of rubber, 100,000 tons of tea, 70,000 tons of coffee, 60,000 tons of pepper, 50,000 tons of tobacco, 40,000 tons of tin, etc. Everyone, even one ton of coal is not small, so where does 8 million tons of oil, 100,000 tons of tea come from? The numbers 8 million, 2 million, 100,000 are easy to say, but in reality, they are enormous numbers. (Laughter) The oil accounts for one-fifth of the world's production, rubber one-third, pepper eight-tenths, and spices one-half. However, even though these necessary resources are abundant, we are not just asking for them. The Empire wants to buy them with money. We offer to buy, but they refuse to sell. Why won't they sell when we offer money? They won't sell because they fear that if they sell those things (그늟� 것을), the East will be put right and prosper. (Applause) As you know, since the Dutch homeland is occupied by the German army and its queen and government are in Britain, the Dutch East Indies is in the hands of Britain, America, and India, and this is happening under the shadow of the demonic grip (魔手) of Britain, America, and India.\n\nSo, is it that America and Britain lack oil, sugar, and rubber without the Dutch East Indies? That's not it either. Britain has plenty to use from Arabia, Africa, Russia, and various other places. America has plenty <42> from its own country and South America. Nevertheless, they insist on using the resources of the Dutch East Indies located in the East only for themselves. That East Asians cannot buy East Asian resources even with money is truly unbearable. It is here that our Empire has reached the point of Impossible Endurance (堪忍不可能). If this can be endured (是加忍也), what cannot be endured (孰不可忍)? Aigoo, it's truly infuriating! (Applause)\n\nPeaceful diplomacy towards the Dutch East Indies was attempted not just once or twice. First, Ambassador Kobayashi went for negotiations, and then Ambassador Yoshizawa also went for negotiations. The Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, having become a puppet (傀儡) of America and Britain, evaded this way and that, ultimately refusing. It even led to the withdrawal of Japanese nationals. How can we not punish these stubborn, cunning, treacherous nations of America and Britain? However, this does not mean we intend to occupy the Dutch East Indies or the Philippines by force and make them our territory. We are waiting for them to abandon their wicked ways, return to the right path, and gladly participate economically in the Co-Prosperity Sphere.\n\nOnce the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is established, East Asians will achieve self-sufficiency with East Asian resources, be liberated from the fetters (絆) of Westerners, and return to the original state of peace in the East. The day the Greater East Asia War broke out was December 8th, the winter solstice (冬節). As it is a war that broke out in winter, Britain, which uses the character for flower root (英), will have its roots frozen, and America, which uses the character for rice (米), will become food for the Imperial army's meals (밥), I believe. (Loud Laughter and Applause) Under the August Virtue (御稜威) of His Majesty the Emperor, winning every battle, winning a thousand battles, the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will be established with haste. The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, stretching 20,000 li east to west and 20,000 li north to south – how can one not exclaim, \"How majestic, how great! How delightful, how magnificent!\" (威哉大哉, 快哉壯哉) (Applause) This is the steady realization of the Imperial Destiny (皇運), boundless with Heaven and Earth (與天地無窮), originating from the Divine Edict (神勅), and the ideal of \"Eight Corners of the World Under One Roof\" (八紘一宇), conceived from the beginning of the nation's founding (肇國).\n\nAh – the time has come to expel the British and Americans who have been encroaching on the East for the past five hundred years! When I think of grappling head-on with the British Empire, which occupied one-third of the world's surface and boasted, \"The sun never sets on our British Empire,\" and with America, which charged in claiming everything number one in the world was theirs, and throwing them with a belly-to-belly lift (배지개), I find it unbearably thrilling! (Applause) When my thoughts reach this point, my shoulders heave up and down involuntarily with excessive joy. However, we must not merely rejoice; until the final glorious great victory is ours, we must fight fiercely (奮鬪力戰). The rise or fall, prosperity or decline of Greater East Asia depends on this one war, so we must strive and exert ourselves even more (一層 더 奮鬪努力). I feel I have said many things out of order and lacking logic due to excessive excitement and thrill. I apologize. (Applause)\nShōwa 17 [1942], December 15th, 6:00 PM\nAt P'yŏngyang Public Hall\nBefore an audience (聽衆) of 5,000 people <43>\n<38-43>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis article is a transcript of a speech given in P'yŏngyang in December 1941 (dated Dec 15th, Shōwa 16, but likely delivered shortly after the Pearl Harbor attack on Dec 8th and published Jan 1st, 1942, Shōwa 17) by the Korean principal of the P'yŏngyang Presbyterian Theological Seminary, Sagawa Hirachika (formerly Ch'ae P'il-gŭn). He vehemently supports Japan's declaration of war against the US and UK, framing it as a necessary step in the \"Shōwa Restoration\" to liberate East Asia from centuries of Western (specifically British and American) oppression, exploitation (citing the Opium War, colonization, resource control in Southeast Asia), and racial discrimination. He positions Japan as the leader (\"sun\") bringing enlightenment and health (\"sunbathing\") to cure Asia's ills, citing Korea's annexation and the situation in Manchuria and China as positive examples. He calls for the establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere for regional self-sufficiency and urges the audience to fully support the war effort for a final victory. The speech is notable for its fervent pro-Japanese, anti-Western rhetoric, its adoption of Japanese imperial ideology (like 八紘一宇), and its delivery by a prominent Korean Christian leader, reflecting the complex pressures and collaborations during the late colonial period. Historians would find the author's identity (a Korean Christian leader adopting a Japanese name and ideology), the specific justifications used for war, the concept of \"sunbathing\" as a metaphor for Japanese influence, and the detailed anti-Western arguments (especially against Britain and the US regarding Hawai'i, the Philippines, and the Dutch East Indies) highly illustrative of wartime propaganda and the dynamics of assimilation policy in colonial Korea.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n東亞\t동아\tEast Asia\n米\t미\tAmerica (USA)\n英\t영\tBritain (UK)\n平壤\t평양\tP'yŏngyang\n平壤長老會神學校\t평양장로회신학교\tP'yŏngyang Presbyterian Theological Seminary\n佐川弼近\t사가와 히라치카\tSagawa Hirachika\n蔡弼近\t채필근\tCh'ae P'il-gŭn\n天皇陛下\t천황폐하\tHis Majesty the Emperor (Tennō Heika)\n支那\t지나\tChina\n皇軍\t황군\tImperial Army (Kōgun)\n明治\t메이지\tMeiji\n大日本帝國\t대일본제국\tGreat Japanese Empire (Dai Nippon Teikoku)\n昭和\t쇼와\tShōwa\n葡萄牙\t포도아\tPortugal\n빠스코ㆍ따ㆍ까마\t바스코 다 가마\tVasco da Gama\n아푸리카\t아프리카\tAfrica\n印度\t인도\tIndia\n골롬부쓰\t콜럼버스\tColumbus\n米洲\t미주\tThe Americas\n濠洲\t호주\tAustralia\n歐洲\t구주\tEurope\n亞細亞\t아세아\tAsia\n靈西亞\t영서아/노서아\tRussia (露西亞, Rosia)\n佛\t불\tFrance\n蘭印\t난인\tDutch East Indies\n蔣\t장\tChiang (referring to Chiang Kai-shek)\n蘇聯\t소련\tSoviet Union\n滿洲\t만주\tManchuria\n阿片戰爭\t아편전쟁\tOpium War\n道光\t도광\tDaoguang (Emperor)\n湖廣總督\t호광총독\tGovernor-General of Huguang\n林則徐\t임칙서\tLin Zexu\n英國政府\t영국정부\tBritish Government\n南京條約\t남경조약\tTreaty of Nanking\n廣東\t광동\tGuangdong\n上海\t상해\tShanghai\n寧波\t영파\tNingbo\n福洲\t복주\tFuzhou\n厦門\t하문\tXiamen\n香港\t홍콩\tHong Kong\n新加坡\t싱가포르\tSingapore\n緬典\t면전\tBurma (Myanmar)\n美國\t미국\tAmerica (USA)\n하와이\t하와이\tHawai'i\n카나카족\t카나카족\tKanaka people\n臺灣\t대만\tTaiwan\n比律賓\t비율빈\tPhilippines\n西班牙\t서반아\tSpain\n米西戰爭\t미서전쟁\tSpanish-American War\n믿웨이\t미드웨이\tMidway\n웨이크\t웨이크\tWake\n구암島\t괌도\tGuam Island\n南洋群島\t남양군도\tSouth Seas Mandate\n獨\t독\tGermany\n뉴기니아\t뉴기니\tNew Guinea\n삐스맑군도\t비스마르크군도\tBismarck Archipelago\n日本帝國\t일본제국\tJapanese Empire\n半島\t반도\tPeninsula (Korea)\n日淸戰爭\t일청전쟁\tFirst Sino-Japanese War\n日靈戰爭\t일영전쟁\tRusso-Japanese War (assuming 靈 refers to 露, Russia)\n汪精衛\t왕정위\tWang Jingwei\n南京政府\t남경정부\tNanjing Government (Wang Jingwei regime)\n蔣政權\t장정권\tChiang Regime (Chiang Kai-shek's government)\n루스벨트\t루스벨트\tRoosevelt (Franklin D.

(박수)\n여러분이 아시는 實例지마는 阿片戰爭에 대하여 몇 마데만 드리렵니다. 距今 꼭 100년 전의 일입니다. 皇紀 2천5백년부터 3년 동안이나 걸린 支英間의 전쟁입니다. 그 전부터 葡萄牙人이 阿片은 支那에 팔기 시작하였지마는 다음에는 점차로 英人이 印度에서 ***을 심어 가지고 支那에 阿片을 수출한 것이었읍니다. 道光年初에 1年間에 1만 상자를 수출하던 것이 月加月增하여 道光13년에는 1年에 3만 상자에 초과한 것이었읍니다. 한 상자에 120斤씩 넣어서 3만 상자이면 1年에 支那人의 금전은 얼마나 빼앗아 갔겠으며 支那人의 생명은 얼마나 破壞하였겠읍니까.(박수) 그때 湖廣總督 林則徐가 阿片禁輸를 교섭하다 못하여 거절을 당하고 분한 나마에 무력으로 阿片 2만 상자를 英人의 船中에서 끄집어 내여 해안에서 소각하였읍니다. 일시 통쾌하기는 하였읍니다. 그러나 그 翌年에 狡猾惡毒한 英國政府는 通商妨害의 조건하에 군함 16척과 운송선 27척으로 征支艦隊를 편성하여 來攻한 것입니다. 支那는 그만 연전연패하여 皇紀 2502년(1842)에 소위 南京條約으로 굴복하였읍니다. 그 조약의 要項은 (1)상금 2천1백萬弗을 배상하고, (2)廣東, 上海, 寧波, 福洲, 厦門의 五處에 개항하고, (3)香港을 割讓하고, (5)수출입물품에 五分課稅을 한 것이었읍니다. 이때부터 阿片은 거이 무제한으로 支那에 수입되어 支那人은 금전을 빼아끼고 능력을 상실하고 생명을 단축시키고 정신을 消耗한 것입니다. 英國의 이 大罪巨惡은 아무 것을 가지고도 代贖할 수 없는 것입니다. 이 不人道, 無人情한 英國을 擊攘할 자가 그 누구입니까. 정의의 기빨을 들고 천명을 수행할 자가 우리 大日本諸國이 아니고 어대에 있겠읍니까. 天道가 순환하여 100년전에 英人에게 할양 하였던 香港을 동양인에게 환원시킬 날, 香港에 일장기가 휘날리는 날이 明日일까요 再明日일까요. 新加坡와 緬典은 ＜39＞ 今週일까요 來週일까요.(박수)\n米國에 대하여 일언하렵니다. 米國은 동양에 기독교를 선전하고 교육기관, 의료기관을 설립하여 不少한 은혜를 끼친 나라입니다. 그리나 그러나 그 반면에 동양을 침해한 종적은 얼마나 많읍니까. 하와이는 본래 日本人이 먼저 들어간 곳이오 금일도 全島인구의 半分이나 되는 16만인이 삽니다. 하와이 주민 카나카족은 치음에 30만이나 되던 것이 지금은 2만명밖에 남지 아니하였읍니다. 그러치마는 米人이 그 땅을 독립왕국에서 민주국에로 옴긴 후에 自國人을 대통령으로 被選되게 하고 距今 41年前에 아주 점령하고 말았읍니다. 우리 帝國의 일부인 臺灣과 접근한 比律賓은 본시 西班牙의 領有이던 것을 距今 43년전에 米西戰爭으로 말미아마 奪取하였읍니다. 그리고는 자기네 交通足場이오 國防要地로 믿웨이, 웨이크, 구암島등을 착착 영유하였읍니다. 구암島는 우리 帝國의 위임통치인 南洋群島의 한복판임에 불구하고 무리하게도 점유한 것입니다. 南洋群島중에 獨領이던 것은 당연히 日獨戰爭의 전승결과로 帝國의 위임통치에 들어올 것을 큰 섬 뉴기니아의 동북부와 삐스맑군도는 英國이 가루채고 구암島는 米國이 가지고 깨알같은 작은 섬들만 우리 帝國에 위임한 것은 인종차별대우에서 나온 불공평한 처치입니다. 이 寃才한 일을 바루 판결한 날이 오늘이 아니고 언제 이겠읍니까. 여러분은 어떻게 생각하십니까. 확실히 오늘이겠지요.(박수)\n\n2. 近年 東亞의 日光浴\n\n光自東方은 天理인 동시에 역사적 標語입니다. 우리 日本帝國은 옛적부터 日出處의 天子를 奉戴하고 日章旗를 고양하고 東方에서 이러나서 皇威國力을 서방으로 宣揚합니다. 태양이 아니고서는 태양계의 모든 행성위성이 존재할 수가 없고, 모든 생물인간이 생활할 수가 없읍니다. 그와 같이 우리 日本帝國이 神國이오 光國으로 八紘一宇의 이상을 실현하여 세계를 재건하여야 하겠읍니다. 나는 平壤名物의 한가지인 일광욕 즉 모래찜을 해본 경험이 있읍니다. 의학박사가 모래찜을 하면서 자외선의 효력이 놀랄 만하다고 하기에 4년여간 일광욕을 하였읍니다.(大笑拍手) 소화불량도 났고 피부병도 났고 기타 여러 가지 중병이 났는다구 야단들을 하두군이요. 나 역시 효험이 있는 것을 확증합니다. 東亞의 중병은 일광욕으로 나을 줄 압니다. 日光到處에 중병이 났고 惡菌이 죽고 元氣恢復이 되고 心身强壯이 될 것입니다. 明治 27,8年役은 日淸戰爭으로 말미아마 半島는 일광욕을 시작하여 지금에 와서는 內鮮一體라는 强壯體를 이루어 갑니다. 明治 37년役인 日靈戰爭으로 말미아마＜40＞ 滿洲는 일광욕을 시작하여 가지고 지난번 滿洲事變에 완전한 蘇生을 보았읍니다. 支那事變이 발생이 된 후 汪精衛氏를 중심으로 한 南京政府가 조직되어 支那도 일광욕을 받는 중입니다. 不遠間에 아즉까지 惡菌毒疾에 걸려 고생하는 蔣政權 아래에 신음하는 支那西北部도 일광욕을 하여야 할 것입니다. 위대한 일광욕의 효력을 아즉도 疑訝할 이가 있겠읍니까 여러분.(박수)\n하와이를 폭격하여 놀랄만한 전과를 거두고 比律賓에 敵前上陸을 감행하고 再來半島와 뾰루네오에도 상륙하고 香港을 진격하고 구암을 점령한 금일에 있어서 루스벨트 각하의 심정은 그 어떻한가.(大笑拍手) 웨 自國古來의 前例를 깨치고 三回까지 대통령 피선거에 출마를 하여 가지고 이 失態를 하는가. 웨 自國傳來의 정책을 무시하여 몬로주의를 버리고 동양 일에 간섭을 하다가 이 망신을 하는가. 野村大使가 교섭을 하고 來栖大使가 또 교섭을 하니 실력이 없고 武備가 부족하여 屬從할 줄로 알았던가. 우리 帝國이 그럴 帝國이 아닌 줄을 몰랐던가. 무던이 배를 내밀고 완강히 거절을 하였다구. 그러면서도 하와이에 경비쪼차 못하여서 一朝爆擊에 전함을 5척이나 잃고 武士를 3천여인이나 葬事한 것을 보면 이름마추 무던히 「루즈」한걸.(大笑拍手) 참말 그 可冷하고 可憎한 언동에는 頂門一針이 당연합니다. 頂門一針이란 말은 실수입니다. 靑天霹靂이라는 것이 당연합니다.\n佛印에는 평화적 進駐가 벌서 오래 전에 실행되고 日泰攻守同盟은 大東亞戰爭의 勃發되는 동시에 체결되여 亞細亞의 동남부 일대가 빨리 빨리 일광욕을 하는 중입니다. 比律賓과 蘭印과 英領과 葡領에도 續續 상륙하여 일광욕이 되는 중입니다. 동양만 아닙니다. 日獨伊三國同盟을 생각하여 보십시오. 獨逸 나치쓰의 지도원리는 日本의 황실중심사상을 級取한 것이오 獨逸국기의 卍는 人道의 스바스티카 한문의 萬字로 동양사상을 취급한 것입니다. 獨逸의 문화와 獨逸의 조직을 우리＜41＞ 帝國에서 모방하여 온 것도 없지는 안치마는 독일의 재생하는 원리원칙이 우리 동양 우리 日本에서 배와간 것인 것은 明若觀火입니다. 이 의미에서 歐洲의 新秩序, 新體制도 일광욕으로서 되는 것이라고 나는 봅니다.(박수)\n\n3. 將來東亞의 共榮圈\n大東亞 共榮圈은 당분간 日本, 滿洲, 支那, 佛印, 泰, 緬典, 馬來, 蘭印, 比律賓 등을 포함하여 말하는 것입니다. 比律賓은 大小 7천83島로 된 大群島인데 그 면적이 우리 半島의 1倍半이나 거이 되는 지방입니다. 그 중에 가장 큰 섬은 呂宋煙이 많이 나기로 유명한 呂宋(루손)島로 首府 마니라가 거게 있읍니다. 皇軍은 벌서 마니라에 머지 아니한 곳에 敵前上陸을 감행하였읍니다. 蘭印은 수마트라, 짜바, 뾰루네오남부, 뉴기니아서부, 쎌레비쓰등의 大쑨다列島와 그 밖에 小쑨다列島등으로 된 萬餘島의 大群島입니다. 그 면적은 대략 2백만 平方粁(키로)로 우리 半島의 거이 10倍입니다. 蘭印 전체는 본국 和蘭에 비하여 58倍强의 면적을 가졌읍니다. 그런데 인구는 도무지 7천만 미만이 거기 삽니다. 그 중에서도 幅面이 작은 쨔바도에 인구 4천여만이 거주합니다. 그러면 쨔바도 외에 우리 半島보다 9倍나 되는 곳에는 인구가 겨우 2천여만이 살뿐입니다. 다시 말하면 荒厚曠野입니다. 그런데 생산으로는 세계의 寶庫입니다. 아니 大東亞의 天賦寶庫입니다. 蘭印에서 재작년에 외국에 수출한 중요물품만을 보면 실로 놀랄 만 합니다. 不油 800萬噸, 砂糖 200萬噸, 고무 30萬噸, 茶 10만噸, 珈琲 7만噸, 胡椒 6만噸, 煙草 5만噸, 錫 砂萬噸 등입니다. 여러분 石炭 한 噸도 적지 아니한데 石油 800만噸, 茶 10만噸등이 어데입니까. 800만, 200만, 10만등의 數字는 부르기는 쉬워도 실상 大般한 數字입니다.(笑聲) 石油는 세계의 5분지1, 고무는 3분지1, 胡椒는 10분지8, 香料는 2분지1이나 됩니다. 그런데 이렇게 필요한 物産이 풍부하다고 그저 달라는 것이 아닙니다. 帝國에서는 돈주고 사자는 것입니다. 사자는데 팔지를 안습니다. 웨 돈주는데 팔지 아니할가요. 그늟� 것을 팔면 동양이 바루되고 잘 될가하여 팔지 아니합니다.(박수) 여러분이 아시다싶이 和蘭本國은 獨逸軍에게 점령되고 그 여왕과 정부가 英國에 가 있는 관계상 蘭印은 英米印의 수중에 있기 때문에 英米印의 魔手 그늘에서 이렇게 되는 것입니다.\n그러면 蘭印이 아니면 米英양국이 석유도 없고 砂糖도 없고 고무도 없어서 그러는 것인가 하면 그것도 아닙니다. 英國은 석유와 고무 등을 아라비아와 아프리카와 靈國과 기타 여러 곳서 넉넉히 사용할 것이 있읍니다. 米國은 자국과 南米洲에서＜42＞넉넉히 있읍니다. 그럼에도 불구하고 동양에 있는 蘭印의 물산을 자기네만이 사용하자는 것입니다. 동양의 물산을 동양인이 돈주고도 못 산다는 것이야말로 어찌 견델 수가 있는 것입니까. 여기서 우리 帝國은 堪忍不可能의 今日에 이른 것입니다. 是加忍也은 孰不可忍 이겠읍니다. 에이구 참말 분해라.(박수)\n蘭印에도 평화적 외교를 한 것이 한 두번이 아닙니다. 우선 前者에 小林大使가 교섭을 갔고 또 芳澤大使가 교섭을 갔던 것입니다. 米英 양국의 傀儡가 된 蘭印總督은 이리 피하고 저리 피하다가 畢竟 거절을 한 것입니다. 邦人이 撤退까지 하게된 것입니다. 이 頑宣狡猾한 米英 양국을 응징하지 아니할 수가 어데 있읍니까. 그렇다고 하여서 蘭印(인)이구 比律賓이구 무력을 가지고 점령하여 우리 영토를 삼고 말자고 하는 것도 아닙니다. 못된 버릇을 버리고 바른길에 돌아들어 경제적으로 共榮圈에 欣然 참가하기를 기다리는 것입니다.\n大東亞 共榮圈이 확립되면 동양인이 동양물산으로 自給自足하고 서양인의 *絆에서 해방을 받아 동양본래의 平和相에 환원될 것입니다. 大東亞戰爭의 터진 날은 12월8일로 冬節입니다. 冬節에 터진 전쟁인 만치 꽃뿌리 영字를 쓰는 英國은 꽃뿌리부터 얼고 말 것이오 쌀미字를 쓰는 米國은 帝國군대의 밥이 되고 말 것이라고 생각됩니다.(大笑拍手) 天皇陛下의 御稜威밑에 百戰百勝, 千戰千勝하여 大東亞 共榮圈은 하루바삐 확립될 것입니다. 동서가 2만里, 남북이 2만里되는 大東亞 共榮圈이야말로 威哉大哉, 快哉壯哉를 부르지 아니할 수 없읍니다.(拍手) 이것이 神勅에서부터 나타나는 皇運의 與天地無窮과 肇國의 시초부터 胚胎된 八紘一宇의 이상이 착착 실현되는 것입니다.\n아- 오백년래 동양을 잠식하야오던 英米人을 驅逐할 때가 왔읍니다. 세계표면의 3분지1을 점령하고서 우리 英國에는 태양이지지 안는다고 自誇自讚을 하여오던 大英帝國과 무엇이든지 세계제일은 우리 것이라고 덤베던 米國과 합꺼번에 마루씨름을 하여 배지개를 들어 메칠 생각을 하면 어찌 통쾌한지 견델 수가 없읍니다.(박수) 생각이 여기 미치면 너머 기뻐서 양  어깨가 저절로 들석들석합니다. 그러나 우리는 너머 기뻐만 할 것이 아니라 최후의 光榮 있는 대승리가 우리의 것이 되기까지 奮鬪力戰을 하지 아니하면 안되겠읍니다. 大東亞의 흥망성쇠가 이 한 전쟁에 달렸으니 우리들은 一層 더 奮鬪努力하여야 하겠읍니다. 너머 통쾌하고 너머 흥분하여 순서 바뀌고 理論不足할 말슴을 많이 한 것 같아 죄송합니다.(박수)\n昭和6年 12월15일 下午6時\n平壤 公會堂에서\n聽衆 5천名을 앞에 놓고 ＜43＞\n＜38-43＞","magazine":"삼천리 제14권 제1호","date":"1942년 01월 01일","title":"The Restoration of East Asia: Stenographic Record of the

The list prominently features the recent Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor as the number one event. Other significant events mentioned include the Soviet counteroffensive near Moscow, US aid to Allied nations (prior to formal entry into the war), the Atlantic Charter meeting between Churchill and Roosevelt, the flight of Rudolf Hess to Scotland, US occupation of Iceland, the North African campaign, the Battle of Crete, the V for Victory campaign in Europe, and the sinking of the Bismarck and HMS Hood. From the perspective of Korean colonial history, the article is revealing in its use of \"우리 해군\" (\"Our Navy\") to refer to the Imperial Japanese Navy, showcasing the assimilationist language mandated in publications during this period. It also demonstrates how major world events, particularly the Pearl Harbor attack which directly led to the expansion of the Pacific War, were presented to the Korean public under Japanese rule immediately after the event.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n뉴욕\t뉴욕\tNew York\nU·P\t유피\tU.P.

Herein, we feature the great lion's roar of patriots for the overthrow of America and Britain, offered to the populace of the Peninsula.\n\nThe Holy War for the Construction of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\nYŏ Unhong\n\nLooking back at the history of humanity over several thousand years, people have fought for various purposes. Expansion of power, seizure of territory, differences in ideology, and various conflicts of interest have been causes of war, but this is the first time a war has truly been fought for justice and humanity, with the Empire of Japan's declaration of war against Britain and America. Although Wilson said during the last World War that America's participation was for justice and humanity, that was merely deceiving the public. Japan's current war against Britain and America is not a fight solely for the survival and development of the Empire of Japan. It is being fought for two greater purposes. One is to rescue the one billion people of Asia from the power of the Anglo-Saxons. <44>\nOver the past 300 years, since Britain invaded India and established the East India Company, almost all of Asia, except for Japan, became colonies or semi-colonies. Even in China, until now, almost everything – politics, education, commerce – has been under the guidance and domination of Britain and America. Britain and America have committed all sorts of evils in their attempt to place all of Asia under their control. If Japan does not win this war, Asia will once again languish as slaves to the Anglo-Saxons for several hundred more years. Therefore, our fight this time is truly a Holy War (聖戰). It is the first Holy War since the dawn of history. The abuses we Orientals have received from America and Britain, the Anglo-Saxons, over the past several hundred years are too numerous to count. Just recounting what I have witnessed and experienced would take all night tonight. To mention just one or two examples, when I first went to Chicago in June 1914, a fight broke out between Black people and Americans due to the abuse of Black people. The Americans shot the Black people with guns, piling up corpses like mountains on the roadside (積屍如山), and the Black people trembled, daring not to go out for several days; the scene was unbearable to witness (目不忍見). We are well aware of the so-called lynching in the American South. I myself have experienced numerous instances of being refused food in restaurants, being kicked out of boarding houses, and being refused service in barbershops. This war is a Holy War to punish these atrocious and lawless Americans, these Americans who advocate for the equality and freedom of mankind yet commit inhumane acts. I wish my voice were louder so I could shout to all the peoples of the Orient – to the entire populace of China, the Philippines, Malaya, India, and the Dutch East Indies – \"Gather under the banner of the Rising Sun to build an Orient for Orientals, and further, to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere!\" The Empire's declaration of war against Britain and America this time is for the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. <45> Therefore, it is a Holy War to build an Orient for Orientals who have groaned under the aggression and exploitation of Britain and America. It is the first Holy War since the dawn of history. It is a Holy War fought for the freedom of all mankind, for world peace. The day is not far off when the bright sun will shine upon the lands of the Orient, and the two nations of America and Britain will fly the white flag beneath us. Youths of the Peninsula, the 25 million people of the Peninsula! The one hundred million masses living under the flag of the sun! The one billion Orientals throughout the East! All arise! Go forth! Fight! Fight until the victory of this Holy War is completely ours! Fight! Fight! (Applause) <47>\n\nLet Us Annihilate Britain and America Along with Their Ideology\nKōyama Mitsurō (Yi Kwangsu)\n\nWithout annihilating Britain and America, a new order will not come to East Asia or the world. Only when Britain and America are annihilated and East Asia is newly established under the spirit of *Hakkō Ichiu* (八紘一宇 - Eight Corners of the World under One Roof) will peace and prosperity come to the various peoples of East Asia.\nHowever, most people are aware of Britain and America's political aggression and economic exploitation in the Orient, but they are ignorant of its ideological poison. We must expel this ideological influence along with the political and economic power of Britain and America.\n\n1. Individualism\nJapanese thought considers the self as a subject of His Majesty, as a child of parents, as a younger sibling to an older sibling, as a husband to a wife, as a parent to a child. That is, one thinks of oneself as responsible within the Five Relations (五倫), not as an individual. Individualism is truly an Anglo-Saxon product. The foundation of Oriental thought is the principle of loyalty and filial piety (忠孝主義).\n\n2. Commercialism - Konma-shyallisŭm (Commercialism)\nMaking monetary profit the standard for human life in all things is also Anglo-Saxon thought. It could be called economic thought-ism (經濟思想主義). It could also be called utilitarianism (唯利主義). They believe the state exists for the benefit of the individual, and if it goes against individual benefit, it is acceptable to revolt against the state; they do not know righteousness (義). Relationships of interest are primary. The idea that the parliament is an assembly for the benefit of taxpayers is Anglo-Saxon thought, and such a concept goes against the Japanese spirit.\n\n3. Rights-ism (權利主義)\nAlthough the concept of rights is said to come from Roman law, it also aligns with Jewish thought. The idea that relationships between father and son, husband and wife, state and citizen are all based on rights has infiltrated us from Britain and America.\nIn the Oriental spirit, there is no assertion of rights. Relationships like ruler-subject, father-son, husband-wife, elder brother-younger brother are bound by affection (情) and righteousness (義), <46> not transactional relationships of exchange based on rights and duties. There is only service (奉仕), only public duty (奉公). Erroneous individualism arises from this rights-based thinking.\n\n4. Utilitarianism/Happiness-ism (幸福主義)\nThe greatest happiness for the greatest number is the national and social ideal of the British and Americans. There are two errors here. One is locating happiness in the material and sensual satisfaction of each individual; the other is the political view of ruling the minority by the majority. The Japanese spirit and Oriental thought are not like this. In the Orient, the purpose of life lies in doing righteous deeds, and ruling the people involves His Majesty alone ensuring that each person finds their proper place.\n\n5. Liberalism/Egalitarianism, So-called Democracy (自由平等主義 소위 데모크라시-)\nFreedom is the most favored slogan of the Anglo-Saxons, but this is merely self-justification and flattery regarding the human weakness of living arbitrarily. For Japanese people, the freedom spoken of by the British and Americans likely does not exist. There is only the way of living gratefully under His Majesty's great benevolence (大御心), and freedom might be called the absence of anyone hindering this life. Regarding equality, it is even more so. Ruler and subject, father and son, husband and wife, elder and younger brothers are by no means equal. Human society can be said to be established based on hierarchical, master-servant relationships.\nWhat has been described above are the main reprehensible Anglo-American ideas that must be rejected. Even if we completely annihilate Britain and America, as long as we do not annihilate these ideas, *Hakkō Ichiu* cannot come. The new order based on harmony (和) cannot come. Harmony (和) means the harmony of great and small, high and low.\nAt this time, the nation must carry out the war against America and Britain with one heart and one mind (一億一心). Simultaneously, we must also annihilate the Anglo-Saxon thought that has long defiled our minds and promote the Imperial Way (皇道). (Applause) <47>\n\nRoosevelt, Answer!\nChu Yohan (Matsumura Kōichi)\n\nWearing the mask of justice and humanity, you perpetrator of exploitation and conspiracy, the world's arsonist, the world's foremost hypocritical gentleman, President Roosevelt of the United States of America.\nYou gentleman in a tailcoat, in reality, the ringleader of bandits engaged in plunder and robbery, Prime Minister Churchill of the British Empire.\nBefore you two great clowns, I ask in the name of the one billion masses of Asia.\nRoosevelt, whenever you open your mouth, you insist on justice and humanity, but which country opposed and deleted the proposal to insert a clause abolishing racial discrimination in the preamble of the Treaty of Paris? Which country's people discriminate against Black people and Orientals within their own borders, not even allowing them to sit together, and hunted slaves on the African continent as if hunting wild beasts? Was this your humanity, your justice?\nWhile advocating the Monroe Doctrine for the Western Hemisphere, forbidding even a finger of interference from other nations, you advocate the so-called Open Door Policy for East Asia, engaging in interference and obstruction. What kind of contradiction and fixation is this?\n\nChurchill, your country Britain calls itself a nation of gentlemen and prides itself that the progress of civilization is the white man's burden. But forcibly selling opium to the 300 million people of India and the 400 million people of China, causing their ruin, is this what you call the progress of civilization? Establishing the East India Company, traveling through the Indian region committing plunder and robbery, eventually enslaving 300 million Indians; imposing unequal treaties on 400 million Chinese people through the power of warships and cannons, damaging their national sovereignty, obstructing industrial development, making them groan forever under a colonial destiny, conspiring to partition and occupy their country whenever opportunity arose, exploiting coolie labor to live luxuriously in villas, and shooting students, peasants, and workers – is this your civilization? <48>\nFreedom of the seas ultimately means freedom of the seas for Britain. Towards other nations besides Britain, you suppress the construction of shipping, envy the development of commerce, tried to restrict our country's navy to a 5:3 ratio at the disarmament conference, occupied all key points of the sea routes across the five oceans, intending to blockade other countries' trade in times of contingency. How can this be called freedom of the seas?\nHowever, your evil fortune has run out. Your conspiracies – obstructing the Manchurian Incident, obstructing the China Incident, not hesitating even to collude with the communist Soviet Union to harass Germany, encircling our country from north and south to achieve your ambition of conquering East Asia – have all been shattered today where our country's evil-destroying sword (破邪劍) flashes.\nThe Imperial Army has endured hardships (臥薪嘗膽) and forged its strength for 30 years, tolerated the intolerable for four and a half years, repeated final negotiations for eight months. Now, rising up at once, yesterday sinking 4 pairs and severely damaging 4 pairs of warships in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, today sinking 2 pairs of British warships in the waters off Malaya – were your warships made of glass?\nThe American people, startled by the air force, are shelling their own aircraft and ships, causing numerous casualties, while Britain laments the \"greatest misfortune since the Great War.\"\n\nDiscouraged Britain, how about quickly raising the white flag?\nThough the small nations of Central and South America, instigated by America, are declaring war one after another, what pain does it cause us? Instead, on our side, have not the great nations of Germany and Italy joined, and has not Thailand, long under Britain's demonic grasp, resolutely concluded an offensive and defensive alliance with us?\nIn the First World War, Britain, France, Russia, America, Italy, and eventually even our Japan joined forces to attack Germany and Austria. But today, Japan, Germany, and Italy are one bloc, and France and Russia have already lost their fighting power. Is not Britain's isolation stark, and its defeat not already decided?\nBritain and America seem to hope for a lucky outcome by dragging our country into a long war, but this war is a so-called resource acquisition war, where national strength grows while fighting. With French Indochina and Thailand on our side, there is no worry about rice. If Malaya falls into our hands, rubber is secured. If the Dutch East Indies are occupied, oil is assured. Is it not America, rather, that will face difficulties due to shortages of rubber and tin?\nIf Singapore falls, India is in peril. On the day the Indian people rise up and expel the British, Britain's lifeline will be endangered.\nThe bombing and sinking of American and British warships is by no means solely the power of gunpowder. It is the spirit of the Imperial Nation (皇國精神) of selfless service to the country (滅身報國); <49> it is the human-bullet power of the loyal and brave Japanese soldiers. The one billion people of the Orient have become one bloc to punish the ambitions of the Anglo-Saxons. We, the 24 million of the Peninsula, have pledged to become warriors of the Greater East Asia Holy War as one united body (渾然一體). The glorious new era is coming. The men and women, old and young of Chosŏn will unstintingly offer their money, strength, brains, and lives to become protagonists of Greater East Asia. (Applause) <51>\n\nOne Stroke of Anger to Pacify the World (一怒而安天下)\nYi Tonhwa\n\nThe great sage Mencius once highly praised the wars in which King T'ang and King Wu subjugated Jie and Zhou as Holy Wars that \"pacified the world with one stroke of anger\" (一怒而安天下). If Mencius's spirit were to witness Our Imperial Nation's Holy War today, he would surely be unable to contain his dancing for joy (手舞足踏). If the China Incident five years ago was the budding of the Holy War, today's war against America and Britain can be called the Holy War among Holy Wars, and simultaneously the war for the completion of the Holy War. That is, with the war against America and Britain, the true nature of the Holy War has become even clearer, and the meaning of the Holy War has become even more evident to the world.\nThe Imperial Nation's concept of justice based on *Hakkō Ichiu* (八紘一宇) and the corrupt history of sin of America and Britain were originally irreconcilable (勢不兩立). Therefore, the Imperial Nation's war against America and Britain has a distinct separation from ordinary wars. This is truly an epoch-making expression of justice arising from the divine revelation of Heaven's mandate (天命) and the turning point of great destiny (大運); it was the radiance of the sacred movement to pacify the world with one stroke of anger. Not only do all people under heaven welcome this war of justice, but also the spirits underground (地下之鬼) will mutually offer unseen aid (互相冥助) to jointly punish the sins of Britain and America, I declare with certainty. As long as the old powers of Britain and America, where the night is deep (夜色沈沈) and the ghostly aura is gloomy (鬼氣陰陰), exist on this earth, the world cannot have peace even for a day, and humanity can never attain happiness. The heavenly mandate of justice has descended upon the Imperial Nation. The heavenly punishment for sin has fallen upon them. Let us arise, the one hundred million subjects! Let us receive the great Imperial Rescript (御大詔) of His Majesty the Emperor, the Manifest God (現人神), and pledge for the certain victory of this Holy War.\nFor the completion of the Holy War, the three essential conditions of Heaven's timing (天時), Earth's advantage (地利), and Man's harmony (人和) must be met. Now, our Imperial Army has gained Heaven's timing, obtained Earth's advantage, and possesses Man's harmony. These are the three great fortunes bestowed upon our Imperial Nation by the gods. Firstly, according to the principle of the cyclical return of Heaven's fortune (天運循環, 無往不複), we have reached the time for the revival of the Great East. The construction of a New East Asia, the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, is truly a mystical calculation obtained through the workings of Heaven's fortune (天運之所致). Light arises from the East. The time has come when the ill fortune under which the Orient groaned due to the tyrannical power of Britain and America for several hundred years disappears, and the Orient becomes the Orient of Orientals (東洋은 東洋人의 東洋이 되는 天時). Justice and injustice, sin and merit, have become self-evident when reflected in the mirror of heavenly principle (天理). The time has come when the enormous dark shadow of Britain and America's sins will disappear into the waves of the Pacific Ocean.\nSecondly, let's look at Earth's advantage (地利). Geographically, the Pacific Ocean is our sea. The gods entrusted the eternal peace of the Pacific <50> to us. The corrupt expeditionary forces of Britain and America are inherently no match for the Imperial Army due to geographical conditions. Behold the reality that in just a few days since the start of the war, the entire Western Pacific has been subdued into the hands of the Imperial Army... There is no need to ask whether the Pacific war will be long or short. Whether long or short, the Pacific will ultimately become the territorial waters of the Imperial Nation. Geography itself explains this.\nThirdly, Man's harmony (人和). Among all nations of the world, there is no country with such good Man's harmony as our Imperial Nation. This is because we possess a national polity incomparable in all nations (萬邦無比의 國體). The Imperial Nation is both a state and one large family. Every one of the one hundred million subjects must offer their lives for His Majesty the Emperor. Loyal and brave beyond compare (忠勇無比), these words literally describe the Man's harmony of the Imperial Nation.\nHeaven's timing, Earth's advantage, Man's harmony – viewed from any angle, victory in the war is already decided. We people of the Peninsula must seize this opportunity to achieve the reality of Japan and Korea as one body (內鮮一體). The era of home front service (銃後奉公) begins now. Let each of us pledge to become a member contributing to the victory. (Applause) <51>\n\nOverthrow British and American Aggressionism\nYi Sŏnghwan\n\nLooking back, humanity has long had its innate capabilities suppressed and its natural demands shackled under extremely unfair balances of power and extremely unnatural international constraints.\nThe Anglo-Saxons, who once built great empires through aggression and colonization, reigned over indigenous peoples through oppression, trampling, exploitation, hardship, and enslavement, using threats, appeasement, intimidation (哃喝), and deceit (欺瞞) as the most effective policies, as means for humans to command other humans. Originally, such vicious methods and means were used when taming and working animals, but the Anglo-Saxon peoples, in the process of invading, conquering, ruling, and exploiting primitive foreign peoples, applied these methods meant for animals to humans. Meanwhile, this habit grew and grew, and they recklessly, without recognizing their opponents, extended these standard methods' poisonous fangs and demonic hands even towards the East Asian world – the birthplace of world humanity and the source that contributed to the culture and happiness of world humanity – sometimes baring their fangs, sometimes wagging their tails, sometimes revealing their teeth and growling. Is there no limit to such impudent behavior? How much more so towards our Japan? It is utterly ridiculous and gut-wrenching.\nWearing the mask of international cooperationism (國際的 協調主義), backed by the Jewish monopolistic financial conglomerates (유다야 獨占金融財閥), the development of US-UK imperialism, using ideological plots, economic manipulation, and military threats, invaded Europe and then began to invade Asia. Most of the Eastern peoples became dependencies of Britain, France, America, etc., and those that did not, with the sole exception of Japan, were somehow, tangibly or intangibly, suppressed under the dominant power of Anglo-American imperialism. During that time, East Asia was invaded materially and spiritually by Anglo-American imperialism, so that the old character of \"East Asia for East Asians\" became unrecognizable.\nToday, as those aggressors enjoy a high standard of living and hedonistic lifestyles, <52> wearing smiles of satisfaction from their sense of superiority, are not the one billion masses of East Asia falling into ignorance, poverty, and decline?\nIf we allow their endless greed, exploitation, and suppression to continue unchecked any longer, letting ourselves be crushed under the wheels of Anglo-American imperialistic aggression, will there be any hope or light in the future for East Asians? Will there be anything other than castration, weakening, and extinction? Will the future of the dark tunnel not just connect to hell?\nHowever, Heaven certainly did not bring superior peoples onto this earth merely to freeze or starve them to death. We absolutely have the right to demand the path of survival and development based on the justice of the world. We have the right to reclaim East Asia from Anglo-American imperialistic aggression. In other words, we have the great right and duty to take back stolen goods with force, through justice and righteous indignation. If we do not overthrow and annihilate the old system of democratic, liberalistic, aggressionistic capitalism centered on Britain and America, and build a world based on a truly moral new order, what will become of our descendants?\nThis was the Japan-China Incident five years ago, and this is the Greater East Asia Holy War that finally erupted this time. What is this if not the sacred task of world renewal (回天之聖業)? Roosevelt and Churchill, when they speak, classify nations into peace-loving countries and aggressive, war-loving countries, saying the former are good, namely Britain and America, and the latter are evil, namely Japan and the Axis powers. They act as if the responsibility and power for promoting good and punishing evil (勸善懲惡) lie with Britain and America. Furthermore, they insist that Britain and America should hold the world's police power, that only Japan, Germany, and Italy should reduce armaments, and that tariffs, commerce, and resource allocation should obey British and American commands. They harbor the audacious dream of perpetuating world domination according to the Anglo-American style. With this dream, the two Anglo-American leaders boarded the warship HMS Prince of Wales in mid-August last year, evaded the nets of German submarines, held the so-called Atlantic Charter meeting off the coast of northern Canada, secretly agreed on the eight-point principles, and were acting high and mighty, weren't they? In the recent Japan-US negotiations as well, they insisted on the so-called Pacific Principles. Their \"principles\" are based on the old order centered on Britain and America established by the Treaty of Versailles after the previous European Great War, which most unreasonably and unfairly divided the world's territories and resources, with Britain, France, and America occupying the vast majority of Heaven's blessings, providing only the small remainder to the Axis group of nations. Their so-called principle is to further enrich and strengthen their own territories and resources.\nEven a lion, after eating a large ox, rests leisurely for 4-5 days, but even a gentle sheep in a pasture will chew on thick pine bark if hungry. <53> In such a case, can a principle be established that calls the lion a peace-lover and labels the sheep an aggressive war-lover? Where could there be greater arrogance and presumption (傍若無人 傲慢無雙)? Like a day-old puppy unaware of the tiger's fearsomeness, America, a nation founded merely 150 years ago, dared to encircle and challenge the Empire with an arrogant and insolent attitude. Behold the sight of its Pacific Fleet being scattered like clouds and mist at a single touch (鎧袖一觸). I truly feel pity for the blunder of the naive magician.\nIn this Greater East Asia War, and indeed in the World War, it goes without saying that the Empire of Japan will be the final victor; this decisive trend is already clear from the reports of great victories arriving moment by moment. Fundamentally, this signifies the success of building a new world order by overthrowing British and American aggressionism, while simultaneously achieving the establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the complete resolution of the China Incident, and also the consummation of Japan-Korea unification (內鮮一體). In other words, *naesŏn ilch'e* (內鮮一體), one hundred million hearts as one (一億一心) – this core entity is what enables the reconstruction of East Asia and the establishment of the new world order. Therefore, knowing the extremely grave duty of the 24 million people of the Peninsula in unifying the national spirit for this war, I hope they will silently march forward in the direction indicated by history. (Applause) <54>\n\nUntil the Enemy Surrenders\nPaek San Ch'ŏngsu (Former name Kim Tonghwan)\n\n1. There are three most pitiful men in the world. First is China's Chiang Kai-shek, second is America's Roosevelt, and third is Britain's Churchill.\nIt is said that the tragic hero of the 19th century was Napoleon, who went to Saint Helena. Now, entering the 20th century, these three men are about to become the most pitiful tragic heroes. Until today, we thought Chiang Kai-shek was the most incompetent among them, but looking at the situation over the past 4-5 days since the outbreak of the great war in the Pacific, Churchill and Roosevelt are several times more incompetent than him. Compared to them, the Anglo-American Pacific navies, their usual boastful talk vanished, were truly annihilated overnight, as if they were toy fleets made of paper. Can they withstand even one-third of Chiang? Or one-fifth? Although they are the enemy, it's pathetic.\nNow, let us try to divine, though I am no shaman or fortune-teller, on what day these three pitiful men and the three countries guided by their hands – namely the Chungking regime, America, Britain – will perish and vanish from the face of this earth.\n\n2. Chiang Kai-shek definitely had one chance to die. Looking at the traces of heroes and great men in history, most are people who died well when it was time to die. Since Chiang Kai-shek was a man of such stature, heaven once gave him a chance to die splendidly. That was when Nanking was about to fall, when the Nanking castle was surrounded doubly and triply, and he was urged, \"Chiang Kai-shek, open the gates and surrender quickly.\" At that time, realizing the misery of having driven the 400 million masses onto the path of death through his own mistakes, Chiang should have run to Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum (中山陵) before Mr. Sun Wen (孫文先生),\n\"Sir! Sir! I have done wrong. I have ruined the homeland, Chung Hwa (中華), that you created.\"\nWeeping thus, he should have drawn his sword and rightly committed suicide by cutting his own throat (自刎). <56> In ancient times, Xiang Yu (項羽), after gaining the world and then being pursued, lost all his eight thousand disciples from Jiangdong (江東). Ashamed to face the elders of Jiangdong (江東父老), he came to the Wu River (烏江), killed his beloved consort, Beauty Yu (虞美人), and then committed suicide (自刎), did he not? A true man's death must surely be like this, but Chiang, like a cornered rat (窮鼠), fled Nanking, ran to Hankow (漢口), and from Hankow went further to Chungking (重慶).\nHe caused the deaths of several thousand student cadets from the Whampoa Military Academy (黃浦軍官學敎), where only the country's brightest talents gathered, and caused the deaths of 3.2 million young Chinese men due to the misguided anti-Japanese war. During the Great Kantō Earthquake (關東震災), I saw over 1,300 skeletons gathered in Tokyo's Asakusa Park (淺草公園), piled two or three times our height. If 3.2 million skeletons were piled up, they would encircle Chungking ten or twenty times over; they would build a new Great Wall along the Yangtze River (楊子江).\nBuried amidst these ghosts and skeletons, perhaps, like Yan Xishan (閻錫山), at the end of his wits, he will enter some temple far away in Tibet (西藏), wear prayer beads and a conical hat, and live as a monk of Lamaism (라마敎). Or else, he will climb Mount Emei (峨嵋山), where Li Bai (李太白) used to roam, gaze at the moon with Song Meiling (宋美齡), and end up committing suicide by throwing himself off.\nIt is said that if all else fails, he plans to live in America, has deposited money in a Washington bank (華盛頓銀行), and keeps an American airplane from the Flying Tigers (구랍파의 미국비행기) waiting in his courtyard, ready to escape at any time. But now, with Japan holding air supremacy over the Pacific Ocean and Germany over the Atlantic Ocean, where can he possibly go? The miserable end of the anti-Japanese hero is truly extreme.\nHowever, it is still not too late. Heaven has given Chiang another chance, one last chance to die a hero's death.\nHe should settle the accounts of the past five years of resistance, gather his troops again, make comprehensive peace, then join hands with the Japanese army and cross the snow-capped Himalayas (히말나야山). Beyond lies India, weeping under 340 years of oppression, Burma (*甸), Egypt (埃及); it is time to advance for the construction of Greater East Asia. Like Napoleon crossing the Alps, he should dismantle cannons, carry them, and cross those mountain ranges buffeted by the north wind (朔風). Even if he falls under British gunfire while doing so, Oriental history will provide him a page of record.\n\n3. Next, when will Roosevelt die? America has deep connections with Chosŏn. It was an American who deceived the old Chosŏn government and bought the Seoul (京城) electric tram installation rights for 200 or 300 *ryang* (兩). It was also an American who maneuvered to buy the excavation rights for the royal tombs in Kyŏngju (慶州) for 400 won. Had they succeeded then, the treasures like the gold crowns (金冠) from the Silla Dynasty (新羅朝) would now be displayed in a Washington museum's (와싱톤博物舘) showcase.\nIs that all? They also got their hands on the Unsan Gold Mine (雲山金鑛) in North P'yŏngan Province (平北). <57> If left unchecked, they would have leased every mine in all of Chosŏn, and figures like the mining kings Mr. Ch'oe and Mr. Pak would not have emerged later, nor would newspaper companies, professional schools, etc., have come into being.\nWhat deeds did this person, who did such ungrateful things to our Chosŏn, perform in the Orient? Claiming to save the Philippines (比律賓) from 300 years of Spanish tyranny, they took it for themselves. Hawaii (布哇) was the same. In their 170 years since founding, they fought 134 wars of aggression, thoroughly conquering, exploiting, and oppressing people of color.\nOverwhelmed by the guilt of losing the Pacific fleet and the censure for starting the war, he will now be chased by the clubs of the American public, abandon the presidential chair, flee northwards, and finally jump into Niagara Falls (나이야가라 폭포) and die.\n\n4. Britain's Churchill causes all 320 million people of India to die at the young age of 26. The average life expectancy of Indians is 26 years (Chosŏn people: 40+ years; people in civilized countries like Germany, Italy: average 40-50). They are born on earth, allowed to live only 26 years, and then killed off. Their industrial policy is wicked. They do not allow Indians to grow rice well for their own consumption. Every year, due to lack of rice, famine occurs, and millions, tens of millions of people perish. They also don't provide medicine, hospitals, or doctors, so 6-7 million die each year from cholera (虎列剌), malaria.\nThey don't provide education either. They fear that if educated, Indians might become more outstanding than the British people back home. Furthermore, Britain forces opium cultivation in India. They prevent the planting of rice or beans and make them grow only opium, which is then sent to British colonies like the Malay Peninsula (*甸) to weaken the iron-like forearms of the native populace. Not only that, they even bring it to China, where it's unwanted, instigate conflicts like the Opium War, seize Hong Kong (香港), and collect indemnities of 200 million *ryang* (兩).\nStill, Churchill might think that since they've dealt with India face-to-face for 340 years, India would, in case of emergency, defend British interests on Britain's behalf. However, the poet Tagore already came to Tokyo years ago and urged that India should become culturally closer to Japan. Would they ask us to serve such atrocious and lawless masters as Britain? Ultimately, Churchill's destination is the island of Saint Helena in the Mediterranean Sea. No, wait, these days the Mediterranean is covered with Italian warships, so he can't go there either. In the end, he will likely drown himself in the nearby Thames River in London (倫敦 뎀스강).\n\n5. Ignoring his own faults, Roosevelt probably thinks that the Philippines, having lived side-by-side [with America] for 40 years, <58> will stand against Japan and defend the Pacific. However, regarding the Philippines (比島), the current president, Mr. Quezon (커즌氏), came to Tokyo 3-4 years ago, observed Japan's politics, military, and culture, returned to Manila, gathered 40,000 government officials and university students in the National Park plaza, and declared that in building the new Philippines, they must look to Japan as a leader. He specifically mentioned emulating three things: military organization, fisheries, and national education centered on Bushido (武士道). Mr. Quezon originally led independence forces as an Army Major during the Spanish-American War (米西戰爭), fought bravely, was captured by the American army, and spent 6 months in prison. Thus, he harbors resentment towards America, not gratitude. Leading the 250,000-strong Philippine regular army, he will now turn his guns towards Washington rather than Tokyo.\nIn short, Guam and Wake Island have already fallen in the Pacific. The next news will likely be the fall of Manila, Singapore, Honolulu. After that, the trio of Roosevelt, Churchill, and Chiang will come before our Imperial Palace's Nijūbashi Bridge (二重橋), kneel, prostrate themselves, and surrender.\nUntil that day, let us pledge to advance into a long-term war of resistance (長期抗戰). (Applause) <59>\n<38-59>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis collection of editorials from the January 1942 issue of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine presents a unified, vehemently pro-Japanese and anti-Allied perspective on the Pacific War, which had just begun. Penned by prominent Korean intellectuals, some using Japanese names, the articles frame Japan's war against the US and Britain as a \"Holy War\" (聖戰) aimed at liberating Asia from centuries of oppressive Anglo-Saxon imperialism and establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere (大東亞共榮圈) under Japan's righteous leadership. The authors denounce Western democracy, individualism, and capitalism as morally bankrupt ideologies responsible for exploiting Asian nations, citing examples like British actions in India and China, and American racism and economic aggression. They celebrate initial Japanese military victories as proof of Japan's spiritual and material superiority, predicting the inevitable downfall of Roosevelt, Churchill, and Chiang Kai-shek. A recurring theme is the call for Koreans to fully embrace *naesŏn ilch'e* (內鮮一體 - Japan and Korea as One Body), reject Western influence, and wholeheartedly contribute manpower, resources, and loyalty to the Japanese war effort, thereby fulfilling their duty as subjects of the Japanese Empire and participants in building a new East Asian order.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, these articles are significant examples of collaborationist rhetoric during the late Japanese colonial period. They reveal how certain Korean elites actively participated in disseminating Japanese wartime propaganda, adopting and promoting ideologies like *Hakkō Ichiu* and *naesŏn ilch'e* to justify Japanese expansionism and mobilize Korean support for the war. Historians might find the specific arguments used to demonize the West (drawing on experiences of racism, critiques of imperialism), the portrayal of Japan as Asia's liberator, and the explicit calls for Korean assimilation and sacrifice particularly interesting for understanding the dynamics of collaboration, coercion, and ideology under Japanese rule during World War II.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n東洋\t동양\tOrient/East Asia\n英\t\t영\tBritain (England)\n米\t\t미\tAmerica (USA)\n朝鮮臨戰報國團\t조선임전보국단\tChosŏn Wartime National Service Association\n日本帝國\t일본제국\tEmpire of Japan\n東亞共榮圈\t동아공영권\tEast Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere (Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere)\n呂運弘\t여운홍\tYŏ Unhong\n亞細亞\t아세아\tAsia\n英國\t영국\tBritain (United Kingdom)\n印度\t인도\tIndia\n東印度會社\t동인도회사\tEast India Company\n日本\t일본\tJapan\n中國\t중국\tChina\n支那\t지나\tChina (derogatory term used by Japan)\n比律賓\t비율빈\tPhilippines\n馬來\t마래\tMalaya\n蘭印\t난인\tDutch East Indies\n치카코\t치카코\tChicago\n米國\t미국\tAmerica (USA)\n米人\t미인\tAmerican(s)\n香山光郞\t향산광랑\tKōyama Mitsurō (Japanese name for Yi Kwangsu)\n李光洙\t이광수\tYi Kwangsu\n八紘一宇\t팔굉일우\tHakkō Ichiu\n앵글로색손\t앵글로색손\tAnglo-Saxon\n로-마\t로마\tRome\n猶太\t유태\tJewish\n陛下\t폐하\tHis Majesty (the Japanese Emperor)\n朱耀翰\t주요한\tChu Yohan\n松村紘一\t송촌굉일\tMatsumura Kōichi (Japanese name for Chu Yohan)\n루스벨트\t루스벨트\tRoosevelt\n아메리카 合衆國\t아메리카 합중국\tUnited States of America\n처칠\t처칠\tChurchill\n大英帝國\t대영제국\tBritish Empire\n巴里\t파리\tParis\n亞弗利加\t아불리가\tAfrica\n西半球\t서반구\tWestern Hemisphere\n東亞\t동아\tEast Asia\n東印度會社\t동인도회사\tEast India Company\n滿洲\t만주\tManchuria\n獨逸\t독일\tGermany\n蘇聯\t소련\tSoviet Union\n皇軍\t황군\tImperial Army (Japanese)\n하와이\t하와이\tHawaii\n眞珠灣\t진주만\tPearl Harbor\n泰國\t태국\tThailand\n伊\t\t이\tItaly (often paired with 獨 as 獨伊 for Germany-Italy)\n佛\t\t불\tFrance (often paired with 英 as 英佛 for Britain-France)\n露\t\t로\tRussia (often paired with 佛 as 佛露 for France-Russia)\n佛印\t불인\tFrench Indochina\n싱카폴\t싱카폴\tSingapore\n朝鮮\t조선\tChosŏn (Korea)\n李敦化\t이돈화\tYi Tonhwa\n孟子\t맹자\tMencius\n湯武\t탕무\tKing T'ang and King Wu\n桀紂\t걸주\tJie and Zhou (tyrannical rulers)\n太平洋\t태평양\tPacific Ocean\n天皇陛下\t천황폐하\tHis Majesty the Emperor (of Japan)\n半島\t반도\tPeninsula (Korean Peninsula)\n李晟煥\t이성환\tYi Sŏnghwan\n유다야\t유다야\tJudea/Jewish\n歐羅巴\t구라파\tEurope\n樞軸國\t추축국\tAxis Powers\n웰스號\t웰스호\tHMS Prince of Wales\n加奈多\t가나다\tCanada\n白山靑樹\t백산청수\tPaek San Ch'ŏngsu (pen name for Kim Tonghwan)\n金東煥\t김동환\tKim Tonghwan\n蔣介石\t장개석\tChiang Kai-shek\n奈巴倫\t나파륜\tNapoleon\n重慶\t중경\tChungking\n南京\t남경\tNanking\n中山陵\t중산릉\tSun Yat-sen's Mausoleum\n孫文先生\t손문선생\tMr. Sun Wen (Sun Yat-sen)\n中華\t중화\tChung Hwa (China)\n項羽\t항우\tXiang Yu\n江東\t강동\tJiangdong\n烏江\t오강\tWu River\n虞美人\t우미인\tBeauty Yu (Consort Yu)\n漢口\t한구\tHankow\n黃浦軍官學敎\t황포군관학교\tWhampoa Military Academy\n關東\t관동\tKantō (Region in Japan)\n東京\t동경\tTokyo\n淺草公園\t천초공원\tAsakusa Park\n楊子江\t양자강\tYangtze River\n閻錫山\t염석산\tYan Xishan\n西藏\t서장\tTibet\n라마敎\t라마교\tLamaism (Tibetan Buddhism)\n峨嵋山\t아미산\tMount Emei\n李太白\t이태백\tLi Bai (Li Po)\n宋美齡\t송미령\tSong Meiling (Soong Mei-ling)\n華盛頓銀行\t화성돈은행\tWashington Bank\n구랍파\t구랍파\tKunming Group (likely referring to the Flying Tigers based in Kunming)\n히말나야山\t히말나야산\tHimalaya Mountains\n*甸\t\t전\tBurma (often appears with 馬來 as 馬來半島와 *甸) - The Hanja seems corrupted or non-standard.

米英양국을 타도하기 위하야 정의의 검을 빼여들게 되였다. 이에 憂國之士의 米英打倒 大獅子吼를 특집하여 半島민중에게 供한다.\n\n東亞 共榮圈建設의 聖戰\n呂運弘\n\n과거 幾千年 인류의 역사를 보면 여러 가지 목적을 위하야 싸와왔다. 세력확장, 영지의 쟁탈. 主義의 相異, 여러 가지 이해관계가 원인이 되어 전쟁하였지만 정말 正義人道를 위한 전쟁은 이번 日本帝國이 英米에 대한 선전포고가 처음이다. 전번 세계대전시 월손의 말이 米國의 참전은 正義人道를 위한 것이라 하였지 그것은 다만 민중을 소긴 것뿐이다. 日本이 이번 對英米戰은 日本帝國의 생존발전을 위하야서만 하는 싸움이 아니다. 더 큰 두 가지 목적을 위하야 싸우게 되었다. 그 하나는 亞細亞 10억 민중을 앵글로색손의 세력에서 구출하자는 것이다.＜44＞\n과거 300연간 英國이 印度에 침입하야 東印度社會社 創立 이래 亞細亞전체가 日本을 際하고는 거의 다 植民地 半植民地로 되였다. 中國도 지금까지 모든 것이 정치ㆍ교육ㆍ상업 거의 다 英米의 지도와 지배 밑에 있게 되였다. 英米는 亞細亞전체를 저이들의 지배하에 두랴고 諸般惡症을 다하고 있었다. 만일 이 전쟁에서 日本이 이기지 못하면 亞細亞는 다시 몇 백년을 뻐치여 앵글로색손의 노예노릇을 하게될 것이다. 그러므로 이번 우리의 싸움은 참으로 聖戰이다. 유사이래 처음으로 있는 聖戰이다. 과거 幾百年을 두고 우리 동양인이 米ㆍ英 즉 앵글로색손에게서 받은 虐待는 이로 세여서 말할 수도 없다. 다만 내가 目睹하고 체험한 것만도 오늘저녁 밤을 새여도 못하겠다. 그 중 한 두 가지만 말할지라도 1914년6월에 내가 처음 치카코를 갔을 때 흑인학대에 흑인과 米人의 사이에 싸움이 났는데 米人들이 흑인들을 총으로 쏘아 길가에 積屍如山하였으며 흑인들이 며칠 두고 감히 출입을 떨고 있는 현상이 目不忍見이였다. 米國남방에 소위 린칭이라는 것을 우리가 잘 아는 것이다. 내가 몸소 당한 것만 해도 음식집에서 음식을 아니 주고 하숙집에서 逐出하고 이발소에서 거절을 당해본 것 1,2차가 아니였다. 이 暴惡無道한 米國人, 인류의 평등자유를 주창하는 米國人의 비인도적인 행사를 응징하려는 싸움이 이번 聖戰이다. 내가 바리기는 내 목소리가 좀 더 커서 支那의 전 민중과 比律賓ㆍ馬來ㆍ印度ㆍ蘭印의 전 동양인은 동양인의 동양을 건설하기 위하여, 한 걸음 더 나아가서는 大東亞共榮圈을 건설하기 위해서 日章旗발 밑으로 모여라 하고 동양의 각 민족에게 웨치고 싶다. 이번 帝國이 英米에 대한 선전포고는 大東亞共榮圈을 위 한 것이다.(47頁하단에 계속)＜45＞ 따라서 英米의 침략과 착취 밑에서 신음하던 동양인의 동양을 건설하는 聖戰이다. 유사이래 처음으로 있는 聖戰이다. 전 인류의 자유를 위하야 세계평화를 위하여 싸우는 聖戰이다. 동양의 천지에 明朗한 태양이 빛이고 米英양국이 우리아래 백기를 날릴 날이 멀지 아니하다. 半島의 청년아, 半島의 2천5백만 민중아. 태양 기발밑에 사는 一億대중아. 전 동양에 있는 10억의 동양인아. 다 이러나거라. 나가거라. 싸워라. 이 聖戰의 승리 완전히 우리에게 올 때까지 싸워라. 싸워라.(박수)＜47＞\n\n思想과 함께 米英을 擊滅하자\n香山光郞(李光洙)\n\n米英을 擊滅하지 않고는 東亞에도 세계에도 신질서는 오지 않는다. 米英을 擊滅하여 八紘一宇의 정신 하에 東亞가 새로 세워지고야만, 東亞 諸민족에게 평화와 번영이 올 것이다.\n그런데 世人은 대개 英米의 동양에 대한 정치적 침략과 경제적 착취는 알지만, 그 사상적 害毒은 모른다. 우리들은 英米의 정치적, 경제적 세력과 함께 이 사상적 세력도 驅逐하지 않으면 안된다.\n\n1. 個人主義\n日本思想은 나라님의 臣民으로서, 어버이의 아들로서, 형의 아우로서, 안해의 남편으로서, 아들의 아들로서의 자기를 생각한다. 즉 五倫의 책임자로서 자기를 생각하는 것이지 개인이라는 생각은 하지 않었다. 個人主義는 실로 앵글로産이다. 동양사상의 근본은 忠孝主義다.\n\n2. 商業主義-콘마-샤ㄹ리즘\n무엇이나 金錢的으로 이윤을 인생 생활의 표준으로 하는 것도 앵그로思想이다. 經濟思想主義라고도 할 것이다. 唯利主義라고도 할 것이다. 그들은 국가도 개인의 이익을 위해서 있고 개인의 이익에 遠返하면 국가는 혁명을 이르켜도 좋다하여, 그들은 義라는 것은 모른다. 利害關係가 주가 되어있다. 議會가 납세자의 이익을 위한 집합이라는 것이 앵그로思想인데, 이런 관념은, 日本정신에 거슬린다.\n\n3. 權利主義\n권리는 로-마법에서 온 관념이라지만, 또 猶太思想도 된다. 父子, 夫婦, 국가와 국민, 어느 것이나 권리주의 관계에 있다고 하는데, 이 사상도 英米로부터 우리들에게 浸*한 것이다.\n동양정신에는 권리의 주장이라는 것이 없다.  君臣, 父子, 夫婦, 兄弟 어느 것이든 情과 義에 의해서 매저지는＜46＞ 것이지, 權利 義務등의 交換條件的, 取引的 관계는 아니다. 오직 奉仕가 있을 뿐이고, 奉公이 있을 뿐이다. 이 권리사상으로부터 그릇된 개인주의가 이러나는 것이다.\n\n4. 幸福主義\n최대다수의 행복이라는 것이 英米人의 국가이상이요, 사회이상이다. 여기에는 두 개의 오류가 있다. 하나는 행복을 각개인의 物質的, 官能的 만족에 두는 것이요, 하나는 다수로서 소수를 다스린다는 정치관에 있다. 日本정신 내지 동양사상은 그렇지 않다. 동양에선 인생의 목적은 의로운 일을 하는데 있는 것이고 인민을 다스리는 것은 나라님 한 분이 게시여, 各人으로 하여금, 그 설 바를 얻게 하는데 있다.\n\n5. 自由平等主義 소위 데모크라시-\n자유는 앵그로人의 가장 즐기는 표어인데, 이것은 인류의 제멋대로 사는 약점에 대한 自己辨解의 내지 阿謟에 지나지 않는다. 日本人에게는 英米人의 말하는 자유는 없을 것이다. 오직 陛下의 大御心을 감사하며 사는 道가 있을 뿐이고, 이 생활을 방해하는 자 없는 것을 자유라 할 것이다. 평등에 이르러서는 더군다나 그러하다. 君臣, 父子, 夫婦, 兄弟는 결코 평등이 아니다. 인간사회는 階級的, 主從的 관계를 기초로 해서 성립되어 있다고 할 수 있다.\n이상 述한 것은 배척할 만한 英米思想의 주요한 것을 든 것인데, 우리들이 米英을 완전히 擊滅하드래도 이 사상을 擊滅하지 않는 이상, 八紘一宇는 오지 못한다. 和로서 責하려는 신질서는 오지 못한다. 和라 함은 大小高下의 조화이다.\n이때, 국민은 一億一心 對米英戰을 수행할 것인데, 동시, 오랫동안 우리들의 마음을 더럽인 앵그로思想도 함께 擊滅하여 皇道를 宣揚하지 않으면 안된다.(박수) ＜47＞\n\n루스벨트여 答하라\n朱耀翰(松村紘一)\n\n正義人道의 가면을 쓰고 搾取와 陰謀를 일삼은 세계의 放火犯, 세계 제일의 僞善君子 아메리카 합중국 대통령 루즈벨트君.\n燕尾服을 입은 신사, 기실은 掠奪强盜를 일삼는 賊魁首 大英帝國 銃理大臣 처칠君.\n위대한 어리꽝대 두 君을 앞에 놓코 十億 亞細亞 대중의 이름 하에서 질문하노라.\n루스벨트여, 그대는 입을 열면 반드시 정의와 인도를 주장하지마는 巴里講和約 緖文에 인종차별 撤廢文案을 삽입하려 할 때에 이것을 반대하야 削除한 것은 어느 나라며 흑인과 동양인을 국내에서 차별대우하야 한 좌석에 앉지도 아니하게 하며 亞弗利加 大陸에서 노예사냥을 하기를 마치 野獸사냥 하듯 한 것은 어느 나라 사람인가. 이것이 그대의 인도며 그대의 정의였드냐.\n西半球에 대하야는 몬로주의를 主唱하야 他國의 一指도 다치는 것을 금하면서 동아에 대해서는 소위 門戶開放主義를 主唱하여 干涉과 防害를 일삼으니 이 어떠한 모순과 憧着의 일인가.\n\n처칠君이여, 그대의 나라 英國은 紳士國이라 자칭하고 문명의 진보는 백인의 負荷라 自肯하고 있거니와 三億의 印度人과 四億의 支那人에게 阿片을 강제로 판매하여 그들로 하여금 패가망신케 하는 것은 그대의 말하는 문명의 진보란 것인가. 東印度會社를 설립하여 印度지방에서 掠奪强盜를 旅行하고 나종에는 三億의 印度人을 노예화하였으며 四億의 支那人에 대하야서는 군함과 대포의 힘으로 不平等條約을 체결하야 국가의 주권을 손상하고 산업의 발전을 障害하야 영원히 식민지적 途命下에 신음하게 하며 기회만 있으면 그 나라를 分割占據하랴는 음모를 하야 苦力을 착취하여서 별장의 호화생활을 하며 청년학생과 農民工民을 사살하니 이것이 그대들의 문명인가.＜48＞\n해양의 자유란 결국에 있서서 英國을 위한 해양의 자유요 英國 이외의 他國에 대하여서는 해운건설을 압박하고 通商의 발전을 猜忌하야 軍縮會議에서 我國의 해군을 5對3의 比로 押縮코저 하면 五大洋의 海路의 요점은 죄다 이를 점거하야 유사시에는 타국의 무역을 封鎖하려하니 엇지 이것을 해양의 자유라 부를 수 있느냐.\n그러나 그대들의 惡運이 다 되엇다. 滿洲事變을 방해하고 支那事變을 방해하고 獨逸을 괴롭히기 위해서는 공산주의의 蘇聯과 野合하기도 부끄러워하지 아니하고 我國을 남북으로 포위하야 東亞征服의 야망을 達하려든 그대들의 음모도 오늘날 우리나라의 破邪劍이 一閃하는 곳에 散散히 부서지고 말았다.\n皇軍은 臥薪嘗膽 실력을 鍛續하기 이에 30年, 참을 수 없는 것을 참기를 4년 반 여, 최후의 교섭을 거듭하기 8개월, 이제 한번 蹶起하며 어제는 하와이 眞珠灣에서 光艦을 격침하기 4雙, 大破하기 4雙, 오늘은 馬來 해상에서 英艦을 격침하기 2雙, 그대들의 군함은 유리로 만들었든가.\n공군에 가슴 놀랜 米國民은 자국의 항공기와 自軍의 乘船을 포격하야 多數한 사상자를 내고 있스며, 英國은 「대전이래 최대의 불행」이라고.\n\n意氣阻止한 英國이여, 하로 바삐 백기를 들면 如何리요.\n米의 使族을 바든 中南米의 소국이 나도 나도 선전포고를 하고 있으나 於我에 무슨 痛痒을 感하리요. 그 대신 我方에 있어서는 獨伊南大國이 참가를 하고 多年 英國의 마수 하에 있든 泰國이 단연코 我와 攻守同盟을 체결치 아니하였는가.\n第1次 大戰에 있어서는 獨墺양국에 대하야 英, 佛, 露, 米, 伊 그리고 나종에는 我日本까지 가담하야 공격하였으나 今日에 있어서는 日獨伊 삼국이 한 덩어리가 되고 佛露는 이미 전력을 상실하였으니 英國의 고립은 蒐然하고 그 敗北은 결정적이 아닌가.\n英米는 我國을 장기전으로 몰아넣어 僥幸의 수를 바라는 모양이나 이번 전쟁은 소위 資源獲得戰爭으로서 一方 싸우며 一方 국력이 增長되는 것이다. 佛印, 泰가 我便이 됨으로 미곡이 염려 없게 되고 馬來가 我手에 들면 고무가 확보되고 蘭印을 점령하면 석유가 안심이다. 도리어 고무와 錫의 부족으로 곤란 바들 자는 米國이 아닌가.\n싱카폴이 함락되면 印度가 危殆하다. 印度人이 일어나서 英을 驅逐하는 날에 英國의 생명선이 위태하게 될 것이다.\n米艦과 英艦을 爆沈한 것은 결코 화약의 힘만이 안이다. 그것은 滅身報國의＜49＞ 皇國精神이요, 忠勇한 日本軍의 육탄의 힘이다. 十億의 동양인은 한 덩어리가 되여 앙글로색손의 야망을 膺懲코저 하는 것이다. 우리 반도의 2千4百萬은 揮然一體가 되여 大東亞 聖戰의 용사 되기를 盟誓하고 있다. 光榮의 新時는 오려한다. 朝鮮의 남녀노소는 大東亞의 주인공이 되기 위하야 돈과 힘과 뇌와 생명을 아낌없이 바칠 것이다.(拍手)＜51＞\n\n一怒而安天下\n李敦化\n\n大賢 孟子는 일즉 湯武가 桀紂를 정벌한 전쟁을 「一怒而安天下」한 聖戰이라 하야 極讚하였다. 만일 孟子의 혼령이 금일 我 皇國의 聖戰을 본다면 가히 手舞足踏을 금치 못할 것이다. 5년 전 支那事變을 聖戰의 萌芽라 하면 금일 對米英戰은 聖戰중 聖戰인 동시에 聖戰의 完遂戰이라 할 수 있다. 즉 對米英戰 이야말로 聖戰의 정체가 一層 명백하야젔고 聖戰의 의미가 加一層 천하에 昭然하야졌다.\n皇國의 八紘一宇의 正義觀念과 米英의 부패한 罪惡史는 원래가 勢不兩立이었다. 그럼으로 皇國 對米英戰은 보통의 전쟁과 絶桀한 구별이 있다. 이는 실로 天命의 神啓와 大運의 轉換으로부터 生하는 劃世紀的 正義의 표현이며 一怒而安天下하는 神聖運動의 광명이었다. 천하의 人이 다같이 이 정의의 戰을 환영할 뿐 안이라, 抑亦地下의 鬼도 互相冥助하야 英米 저들의 죄악을 共誅하리라 단언한다. 夜色이 沈沈하고 鬼氣가 陰陰한 저들 英米 구세력이 지구상에 존재한 이상 세계는 1일도 평화 할 수 없고 인류는 영원히 행복을 享得할 수 없다. 정의의 天命은 皇國에 降臨하였다. 죄악의 천벌은 저들의게 내렸다. 이러나자, 一億의 臣民. 現人神이신 天皇陛下의 御大詔를 받들어 이 聖戰의 필승을 期하자.\n聖戰의 完遂에는 天時, 地利, 人和의 삼대요건이 구비하여야 한다. 이제 우리 皇軍은 天時를 탓고 地利를 얻었고 人和를 가졌다. 이는 神이 우리 皇國에 내려 준 삼대 행운이었다. 첫재로 말하면 天運循環, 無往不複의 理에 의하야 大東方의 復活時期에 도달하였다. 新東亞建設, 大東亞共榮圈은 실로 天運의 所致로 얻어진 신비적 靈算이었다. 광명은 동방으로부터 이러난다. 屢百年동안 英米의 포악한 세력에 신음하든 악운이 살아지고 동양은 동양인의 동양이 되는 天時가 돌아왔다. 正義와 不正義 罪惡과 功德, 天理에 거울에 비치워 스스로 명백하야졌다. 英米의 저 거대한 죄악의 暗影은 太平洋 물결 속에 살아질 天時는 왔다.\n둘재, 地利로 보자. 太平洋은 지리상 우리의 바다다. 神은 太平洋의 永遠太平을＜50＞ 우리에게 막겼다. 英米의 부패한 永遠征軍은 지리적 조건에서 원래가 皇軍의 對手가 못된다. 보라, 개전 不數日에 西太平洋 전반이 皇軍의 手에 정복된 현실을... 太平洋의 전쟁이 持久이랴 短期이랴 이것은 물을 필요가 없다. 持久이든 短期이든 太平洋은 결국, 皇國의 領海가 되고 말 것이다. 이는 지리 자체가 설명하고 있다.\n셋재는 人和다. 세계 만방에 우리 皇國과 같이 人和가 조흔 나라는 없다. 이는 萬邦無比의 國體를 가진 까닭이다. 皇國은 국가인 동시에 一大家族이다. 一億의 臣民은 누구나 天皇陛下를 위하야 생명을 받처야 한다. 忠勇無比 문자 그대로가 皇國의 人和다.\n天時, 地利, 人和, 어대로 보든지 勝戰은 임이 결정되였다. 우리 半島人 된 자는 이 기회에 있어 內鮮一體의 실적을 거두어야 한다. 銃後奉公의 시대는 이제부터다. 우리는 각자가 승전의 일원이 되기를 盟誓하자.(拍手) ＜51＞\n\n打倒 英米 侵略主義\n李晟煥\n\n도라보건대 인류는 오랫동안 지극히 불공평한 勢力權衡과 지극히 부자연한 國際制約 밑에서 天賦의 性能을 억압당하여 왔고, 자연의 요구가 桎梧되여 왔습니다.\n일즉이 침략과 식민으로써 대제국을 건설한 앙그로삭슨은 壓迫과, 蹂躪과, 搾取와, 苦勞과, 노예화로써 토착 민족에게 군림하야 인간이 인간을 驅使하는 수단으로서 威脅과 懷柔와, 哃喝과, 欺瞞과를 가장 유효한 정책으로 쓰고 있섰든 것입니다. 원래 이러한 악독한 수단 방법은 인간이 동물을 질드려서 부려먹는 때에 쓰는 수단이엿엿건만 앙그로삭손 민족은 원시적 이민족을 침략하야 정복하고, 통치하야 혹사하는 그 과정에 있어서 이 동물에 대한 수단을 인간에게 둘너대고 적용하였든 것입니다. 這間 그들은 이 버릇이 자라고 자라서 함부로 상대도 몰나보고 세계인류의 발상지오, 또 세계인류의 文化와 幸福과를 공헌한 源泉地인 東亞天地와 東亞民族에 대하야도 이 常套手段의 毒牙와 魔手를 내밀어 때로는 헤를 날늠거리고, 때로는 꼬리도 흔들고, 때로는 니발을 드러내고 으르릉대기도 하고 있섰든 것이니 건방진 수작도 분수가 있지 안는가. 하물며 우리 일본에게 대하야서 그 笑止千萬 배창자 앞은 일이다.\n그들은 국제적 協調主義라는 가면을 쓰고 유다야 獨占金融財閥을 배경으로 한 米英 제국주의의 발달은 사상적 奸策과, 경제적 弄絡과, 군사적 脅威를 가지고, 歐羅巴를 침략하고 이여서 亞細亞를 침략하기 시작하야 동방 諸民族의 대부분은 英佛米등의 屬領이 되였고, 그러치 않은 것으로 오직 日本 하나을 除한 외에는 유형 무형으로 어느 새이에 英米人 제국주의의 지배세력 하에 제압되였든 것입니다. 東亞는 그 동안 물질로 정신으로 英米人 제국주의에게 침략된 바 되여서 東亞人의 東亞라는 옛 면목은 찾어볼 수 없이 되였습니다.\n今日 저들 침략자가 고도의 생활수준과 享樂的 생활을 질겨워하고＜52＞ 우월감의 만족한 미소를 띠울 때에 東亞 十億의 민중은 無智와 貧困과 衰亡에 빠저 있지 안는가.\n우리가 만일 이 이상 더 그들의 끝없는 貪慾과 搾取와 制壓을 맘대로 하도록 하야 英米人 제국주의적 침략의 輪轍下에 바스러지게 된다면 東亞人의 前途에는 희망도 광명도 없이 오직 去勢와, 衰弱과, 滅亡이외에는 아모 것도 없고 암흑한 돈네루의 前途는 지옥을 接續하는 것뿐이 아니겠습니까.\n그러나 天은 결코 우량 민족을 어러죽고, 굴머죽이기 위하야 이 지상에 출현시킨 것은 결코 안입니다. 우리는 단연코 생존과 발전의 길을 천하의 정의에 의하야 요구할 권리를 가지고 있읍니다. 우리는 英米人의 제국주의적 침략에서 東亞를 돌여와야 할 권리가 있는 것입니다. 다시 말하면 도적마젔든 물건을 實力을 가지고 正義와 義憤으로써 도로 빼아서 와야 할 큰 권리와 책무가 있읍니다. 그리하야 英米를 중심하였든 民主主義的, 自由主義的, 侵略主義的 資本主義의 舊體制를 打倒 擊滅하고, 진정한 道義的 신질서에 의한 세계를 건설하지 아니하면 今後 우리의 자손들이 어떻게 될 것인가.\n이것이 5년 전 日支事變이오 今次 터지고야 만 大東亞 聖戰입니다. 이것이 回天의 聖業이 아니고 무엇이겠습니까. 루-스벨트나, 처-칠은 입을 열면 平和愛好國家와 侵略好戰國를 분류하야 말하되 前者는 善이라 하야 英米가 그것이오, 後者는 惡이라 하야 日本과 밑 樞軸國이 그것이라고 하면서 그 勸善懲惡의 책임과 實力이 英米에 있는 듯이 작정하고 또, 세계의 警察權을 英米가 가지여야 되고 軍備縮少는 日獨伊만 하고, 關稅 通商 資源分割 등은 英米의 명령을 순종하라는 그야말로 英米樣式에 의한 세계지배를 항구화하여 보랴는 배씸 좋은 꿈을 실고, 지난 8月 중순에 英米 兩巨頭는 군함 웰스호를 타고 獨逸 잠수함의 그물눈코을 피하여서 加奈多 北方沿岸 바다 우에서 소위 洋上會談 8個條의 원칙을 密約하고 바로 웃줄대고 있섰지 않었는가. 今般 日米交涉에 있어서도 소위 太平洋原則論을 고집하였으니, 그들의 원칙이라는 것이라는 것은 前番 歐洲大戰 이후 벨사이유조약이라는 英米 중심의 구질서에 의하야 세계의 영토와 자원을 가장 불합리 불공평하게 분할하야 天惠의 대부분을 英佛米가 점령하고 그 잔여의 소부분을 樞軸國家群에 제공하였든 것인데 그들은 그들의 영토자원을 一層 富益富하게 강화하자는 것이 소위 원칙 원칙 하는 그들의 원칙입니다.\n사자도 큰 소 한 마리를 먹고 나면 4,5일간은 閑暇安眠하지만 온순한 목장 속의 양이라도 배가 곺으면 두터운 松皮를 씹는 것이니,＜53＞ 그러면 이 때에 사자를 平和愛好者라고 하고, 양을 가르처 侵略好戰者라고 하는 원칙론이 성립될 수 있겠는가. 傍若無人 傲漫無雙함이 이에서 더할 이 어데 있으랴. 하루강아지 범 무서운 줄 모른다고 건국 불과 150년밖에 못되는 米國이 감히 傲慢不遜한 태도로 帝國을 包圍挑戰 하다가 과연 鎧袖一觸에 동양함대가 雲散霧消된 꼴을 보라. 도리혀 철없는 요술쟁의 실수를 가이없이 생각합니다.\n이번의 大東亞戰爭에 있어서는 물론, 세계대전에 있어서 日本帝國이 최후 승리자가 될 것은 두말할 것도 없이 벌서 결정적 대세인 것은 現下 刻刻으로 보도되는 大捷에 의하야도 알 일입니다. 이것은 근본적으로 打倒 英米侵略主義의 세계 신질서 건설의 성공임과 동시에 大東亞共榮圈의 확립, 支那事變의 완전 처리, 또 內鮮一體의 完遂도 되는 것이니 박구어 말하면 內鮮一體 一億一心, 이것이 핵심체가 되여서 비로소 東亞의 재건이 되고, 세계 신질서의 확립이 되는 것이니 今次 전쟁에 있어서 국가 정신 통일상 半島 2천4백만의 임무가 지극히 중대한 것을 알고 묵묵히 역사의 示現하는 방향으로 邁進하기를 바라는 바입니다.(拍手)＜54＞\n\n敵이 降服하는 날까지\n白山靑樹(舊名 金東煥)\n\n1. 세상에 가장 불상한 사내 셋이 있읍니다. 그것은 支那의 蔣介石과 第二는 아메리카의 「루-즈벨트」, 第三은 英吉利의 「쳐-칠」이올시다.\n19世紀의 비극의 주인공을 센트ㆍ헤레나로 간 奈巴倫이라더니, 오늘의 20世紀에 들어 가장 불상한 비극의 주인공은 바야흐로 이 세 사람이 될 것이외다. 그런데 우리는 오늘까지 생각하기를 蔣介石을 그 중에서도 가장 못난 사람인 줄 알었더니 太平洋에 대전이 터진 이래 4,5일의 모양을 보니 쳐-칠과 루-즈벨트는 그의 몇 갑절 더 가게 못났음니다. 거기 대하면 英米의 太平洋해군은 평일의 豪言壯談도 어디 갔는지 진실로 조히로 만든 장난감 함대라 하리 만치 一朝에 擊滅을 당했으니 蔣의 三分의 一이나 버틸가요, 五分의 一이나 버틸까요. 적의 일이었만 딱하외다 그려.\n이제 우리는 이 딱한 세 사내와 그 사내 손에 지도되는 세 개의 나라-즉 重慶政權, 米國, 英國-은 어느 날 멸망하여 이 지구 우에서 자최를 감출 것인가, 나는 무당판수는 아니올시다만은 점이나 처보기로 합시다.\n\n2. 蔣介石은 꼭- 한번 죽을 기회가 있었어요. 역사상 英雄傑士의 자최를 보면 대개가 죽을 시절에 잘 죽은 사람들입니다. 蔣介石에게도 그만한 인물이니 만치 이 전날 하늘은 훌융히 죽을 기회을 한번 준 적이 있어요, 그것은 南京陷落이 될 때, 즉 南京城을 두겹 세겹 에워싸고 蔣介石이여 어서 성문을 여러 항복하라고 권고를 바들 적에 蔣은 자기의 잘못으로 四億萬 대중을 죽엄의 길로 모라넛는 비참을 깨닫고 그 길로 中山陵 孫文先生 앞에 달려가\n「先生이여 先生이여 내가 잘못하였나이다. 당신이 만들어 내 논 조국 中華를 내가 그릇처 놓았나이다」\n하며 눈물 뿌리면서 칼을 들어 제목을＜56＞ 잘나 自刎하여야 옳았을 것입니다. 녯날 項羽는 천하를 얻었다가 쪼겨 쪼겨 江東 八千弟子를 다 노친 뒤 江東父老를 무슨 낯으로 보랴고 烏江에 와 사랑하는 處 美人을 죽이고, 저마저 自刎하지 않었습니까. 장부의 죽엄이 반드시 이래야 할 것을 蔣은 窮鼠와 가치 南京을 도망하여 漢口로 달리고 漢江서 마저 重慶으로 갔습니다.\n그는 전국의 秀才들만 모힌 黃浦軍官學敎 學生隊 수천명을 죽었고 중국 청년 320만 명을 그릇된 抗日戰 때문에 죽었습니다. 나는 關東震災 때 東京 淺草公園에서 1,300여 명의 백골을 모아 논 것을 보았는데 우리 키 두어 길 되여요, 320만 개의 백골을 쌓아 놋는다면 重慶을 열벌 스무벌 감울 것이요 楊子江 근방에 새로운 萬里長城을 쌓을 것이외다.\n이 幽靈과 백골 속에 쌓인 그는 閻錫山 모양으로 惱腦의 끝에 저-멀니 西藏, 어느 절에나 드러가 염주 걸고 곳갈 쓴 「라마敎」의 중이나 되여 지내겠지오, 그러찬으면 李太白이 놀든 峨嵋山에나 올너가 宋美齡이와 더부러 달구경하다가 투신자살하고 말 것입니다.\n그는 모든 것이 다 안되면 米國 드러가 살려고 돈도 華盛頓銀行에 저금하고, 뜰 앞에는 언제든지 도망할 수 있게 구랍파의 미국비행기를 等待시키고 있다 하는데, 이제는 太平洋 바다의 制空權은 日本이, 大西洋 바다의 制空權은 獨逸이 갖었으니 어단들 갈 수 있으랴. 抗日英雄의 말로의 悲慘, 참으로 지극 하올시다.\n그러나, 아직도 늦지 않었어요, 蔣에게 하늘은 다시 한 번 기회를 주었어요, 영웅의 죽엄을 하라고 다시 한 번 마즈막 기회를 주었어요.\n그는 5년 항전의 과거를 청산하고 군대를 걷어 다시 몰고서, 全面和平을 한 뒤 日本軍과 손을 맛잡고서 저리 白雪을 인 「히말나야」산을 넘으란 말입니다. 거기에는 340년의 압제에 우는 印度가 있으니, *甸이 있고, 埃及이 있으니, 대동아건설을 위하여 진군할 때입니다. 나파륜이 알푸스山을 넘듯 대포를 뜯어 메고 朔風 부는 저 산맥을 넘으란 말이야요. 그리다가 英軍의 총에 마저 넘어진들, 동양 역사는 一頁의 기록을 남기기에 그에게 조히를 제공할 것입니다.\n\n3. 그 다음 루-즈벨트는 언제나 죽을가? 米國이라 하면 朝鮮과는 緣故가 깊어서 옛 朝鮮 정부를 속이고 京城電車 부설권을 200兩인가 300兩에 산 자도 米國人이요, 慶州의 王陵祭堀權을 400원에 살려고 운동한 자도 米國人입니다. 그 때 속이였든들 저 新羅朝의 金冠 등 보물은 지금쯤 와싱톤博物舘의 陳列棚에 놓였을 것입니다.\n그 뿐인가요, 平北 雲山金鑛도 손에＜57＞ 넣었는데 그양 두엇녀면 全鮮 鑛山이란 鑛山을 모다 租借하여, 뒷날 崔某, 朴某라 하는 鑛山王도 안나왔을 것이요, 신문사, 전문학교 등도 생기지 않었을 노릇입니다.\n이렇게 우리 朝鮮에 고맙지 못한 일을 한 그가 동양에서는 대체 었든 일을 하였든고, 比律賓을 西班牙의 300년 폭정에서 구해 준다고, 그대로 제가 생겼고, 布哇도 마찬가지였지요, 건국 170년에 134회의 침략전쟁을 하여 유색인종을 到底에서 征服하고 搾取하고 壓迫하여 왔지요.\n그는 太平洋함대를 마저 먹은 죄와 전쟁을 이르킨 問責에 못이겨 이제 米國민중의 몽둥이에 쫓겨서 대통령의 의자를 버리고 북으로 북으로 쪼겨서 나종엔 「나이야가라」폭포에 뛰여들어 죽고 말 것입니다.\n\n4. 英吉利의 쳐-칠은 印度人 3억2천만 명을 모도 다 26세의 청년 시대에 죽게 함니다. 印度人의 평균수명은 26세요, (朝鮮人은 40餘歲, 獨逸 伊太利등 文明國人의 평균수명은 40 내지 50) 지구상에 났다가 스물 여섯 살만 살게 하고는 죽여버려요. 그네의 산업정책은 고약하여요. 印度人이 먹을 쌀은 잘 짓게 하지 안어요. 해마다 쌀이 없어 饑饉에 들어 수백만, 수천만 인구가 몰사합니다. 또 약과 병원과 의사도 주지 안어 虎列剌, 마라리아에 6,7백만씩 죽어집니다.\n교육도 식히잔어요. 교육을 시켜 놓으면 본토의 英國人보다 더 훌융하게 될가 보아서 그리지요. 또 영국은 阿片栽培는 印度에 시키지요. 쌀이나 콩은 심으게 못하고 阿片만 작고 심어 그것을 英領식민지인 馬來半島와 *甸 등지에 보내어 토착민중의 무쇠같은 팔뚝을 녹이는데 쓰지요. 그뿐더러 남이 싫다는 支那에 까지 가지고 가서 阿片戰爭같은 싸움을 걸어서 香港도 빼앗고, 2億萬兩의 상금도 받아먹지요.\n그래도 쳐-칠은 340년 동안이나 머리를 맛대고 지내 온 印度니까, 만일의 경우는 印度가 英國에 대신해서 英國의 이권을 옹호해 주리라고 할 것이나, 벌서 시인 타골- 같은 사람은 年前 東京에 와서 印度는 日本과 문화적으로 가까워야 한다고 부르지젔음니다. 우리들 英國 같은 暴惡無道한 상전을 상전으로 섬기라 하리까. 결국 쳐-칠의 갈 곳은 지중해의 센트-헤레나 섬입니다. 아니 지중해에도 요지음은 伊太利 군함으로 덮였다니 거기도 못 가고 결국 가까운 倫敦 뎀스강에 빠저 죽을 것입니다.\n\n5. 제 잘못은 덮어놓고 아마 루-즈벨트도 40년 동안 어깨를 가지러니 사라오든 比律賓이니 日本에＜58＞ 대항하여 太平洋을 지켜 주리니 생각할는지 모르나 그러나 比島로 말하면 現 대통령 커즌氏가 3,4년 전 東京에 와서 日本의 정치, 군사, 문화를 視察하고 마닐라에 도라가 國立公園廣場에다가 정부관리와 대학생들 4만 명을 모아 놓고 새로운 比律賓 건설에는 日本을 지도자로 알고 해 나가지 않어서는 안되겠다고 말하고, 그 중에도 군사조직, 어업, 武士道를 主宗으로 한 국민교육의 세 가지를 본받겠다고 말하였음니다. 커즌氏는 원래 米西戰爭 때, 독립군을 끄을고 陸軍少佐로써 奮戰하다가 米國군대에 捕虜되여 6개월 監獄에 있든 사람이니 米國에 怨은 있을지언정 恩은 없을 사람입니다. 25萬의 比島 常備軍을 이끌고 있는 그는 東京보다 華盛頓에 이제 총뿌리를 돌일 것입니다.\n요컨대 벌서 太平洋에서는 괌, 웨-크島가 함락되고, 요다음 뉴-쓰는 마닐라, 싱가볼, 호노루루가 떠러진단 소리가 들일 것이오 그런 뒤 루-즈벨트, 쳐-칠, 蔣의 3人 男은 이제 우리 皇城 二重橋 앞에 와서 무릅을 꿀고 업대여 항복할 것입니다.\n그 날까지 우리는 盟誓코 長期抗戰에 나아갑시다.(拍手) ＜59＞\n＜38-59＞","magazine":"삼천리 제14권 제1호","date":"1942년 01월 01일","title":"The Great Lion's Roar for Overthrowing

authority of the Imperial Nation (皇國) and holding high the great banner (大旆) of righteousness, we, the one hundred million Japanese people, together with the Imperial Army, have taken up the sword of destroying evil and revealing righteousness (破邪顯正). Smilingly rising up against America and Britain (米英), the inveterate enemies of East Asia and the public enemies of the world, we delivered a swift, bold, fierce, and unparalleled iron hammer of chastisement (膺懲). That we have achieved, in just one month, great military results unprecedented in history is thanks to the great struggles of our loyal, brave, and peerless officers and men of the Army and Navy, burning with a spirit solely dedicated to decisive action and martyrdom for the nation (決死殉國) under His Majesty's radiant Great Majesty (大御稜威). As citizens of the home front (銃後國民), we cannot suppress our feelings of gratitude and deep emotion.\n\nWe, the people, who have reverently received the Great Imperial Rescript (大詔), have already sworn to the gods (神明) immediately after the outbreak of war that no matter what difficulties lie ahead, we must dedicate everything in our lives to the rise and prosperity (興隆) of the nation and resolutely see through this Great War (大征戰) together with the Imperial Army. Now, as the year changes and we greet the New Spring of Greater East Asia in the Imperial Year 2,602 (皇紀 2,602年), I believe that the 24 million League members must pledge anew our strong, iron-and-stone-like solidarity and the practice of the Great Way (巨道), giving our all to repay the nation and martyr ourselves for the nation.\n\nNow is the time to demonstrate the true worth and strength of our League (聯盟) Patriotic Squads (愛國班) organization, which we have nurtured daily for the five years since the Incident began.\n\nTo my dear comrades-in-arms (戰友諸君) of the Patriotic Squads throughout all of Korea (全鮮)! This year is truly the glorious year to show them the true power of the Divine Nation, Japan (神國 日本). It is a once-in-a-thousand-years opportunity (千載一遇) to thoroughly annihilate (擊滅) America and Britain, and simultaneously a crucial year for us East Asians to achieve great development (遂).\n\nWe League members, who have received life in this era of great leaps forward (大躍進時代) that prospers together with heaven and earth, must, without a single person falling behind, grasp each other's hands, look forward together to the boundless future of the Imperial Nation (皇國), and cheerfully embody (翳하여) an active, progressive (積極進取), certainly victorious and undefeated (必勝不敗), vigorous national spirit. We must resolutely forge ahead (邁進) to carry through the righteous war (征戰), contemplate the Imperial Concerns (聖慮), and repay even one ten-thousandth of the Imperial Grace (皇恩).<61>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis 1942 New Year's editorial by Kawagishi Bunzaburō, the Japanese Secretary-General of the National Mobilization League of Korea, is a piece of wartime propaganda. It celebrates Japan's early victories against the US and UK in the Pacific War, framing the conflict as a righteous crusade under the Emperor. Kawagishi calls upon the 24 million Korean members of the League, organized into Patriotic Squads (Aegukpan), to rededicate themselves to Japan's cause, emphasizing total mobilization, sacrifice, solidarity with the Imperial Army, and repayment of Imperial benevolence. The article highlights the intensification of forced mobilization in colonial Korea following Pearl Harbor, using imperial ideology (Hakkō Ichiu, Imperial Year, Divine Nation) to demand Korean participation in Japan's \"Greater East Asia War.\" For historians, this text clearly illustrates the mechanisms and rhetoric of Japanese colonial control and wartime mobilization in Korea, showcasing the role of collaborator organizations like the National Mobilization League and the coercive integration of Koreans into the Japanese war effort under the guise of shared destiny and imperial loyalty. The explicit call for Koreans to \"repay the nation and martyr ourselves for the nation\" (Japan) is particularly revealing of the assimilationist and sacrificial demands placed upon the colonized population.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n國民總力朝鮮聯盟\t국민총력조선연맹\tKungmin Ch'ongnyŏk Chosŏn Yŏnmaeng\n川岸文三郞\t가와기시 분자부로\tKawagishi Bunzaburō\n八紘一宇\t팔굉일우\tHakkō Ichiu\n皇國\t황국\tHwangguk (Imperial Nation)\n日本人\t일본인\tIlbonin (Japanese people)\n皇軍\t황군\tHwaggun (Imperial Army)\n米英\t미영\tMi-Yŏng (America and Britain)\n東亞\t동아\tTong-A (East Asia)\n陸海軍\t육해군\tYukhaegun (Army and Navy)\n銃後國民\t총후국민\tCh'onghu Kungmin (Home front populace)\n神明\t신명\tSinmyŏng (Gods/Deities)\n皇紀\t황기\tHwanggi (Imperial Era/Year)\n聯盟員\t연맹원\tYŏnmaengwŏn (League members)\n聯盟\t연맹\tYŏnmaeng (League)\n愛國班\t애국반\tAegukpan (Patriotic Squad)\n全鮮\t전선\tChŏnsŏn (All of Korea)\n戰友\t전우\tChŏnu (Comrades-in-arms)\n神國\t신국\tSin'guk (Divine Nation)\n日本\t일본\tIlbon (Japan)\n東亞人\t동아인\tTong-a-in (East Asians)\n\n**Glossary**\n\n八紘一宇\t팔굉일우\t\"Eight Crown Cords, One Roof\"; Japanese political slogan meaning the divine right of Japan to unify the world under the Emperor.\n皇國\t황국\tImperial Nation (referring to Japan).\n大旆\t대패\tGreat banner.\n破邪顯正\t파사현정\tDestroy evil, reveal righteousness; a Buddhist term co-opted for militaristic justification.\n膺懲\t응징\tChastisement, disciplinary punishment (used by Japan to describe its military actions).\n大御稜威\t대어미릉위\tGreat August Virtue/Majesty (of the Emperor).

Also, concerning the Chōsen Army's stance towards the current war upon its outbreak, it was announced in a statement by the Army Commander via newspapers and radio on December 8th that the Chōsen Army has established a system capable of responding to and crushing any enemy invasion at any time, and that all necessary preparations for ensuring the security of the Peninsula are in place.

This has been the case since the previous European War. That is, it has become wars of several countries <62> against several countries. Not just in warfare, but also in peacetime economic conditions and measures for ensuring the happiness of the people, everything has moved towards a bloc system. Namely, the Anglo-Saxon Britain and America created an Anglo-American bloc, and the Soviets also created a Soviet bloc; the situation progressed in this manner.\n\nHowever, at the conclusion of the previous European War, Britain and America put forth a policy of national self-determination, imposing it on countries other than themselves to prevent them from forming economic blocs. They created numerous small countries indiscriminately, ultimately placing these small countries under their sphere of influence and positioning them between other countries, thereby disrupting the formation of blocs. In other words, it was a strategy where they formed their own bloc while preventing their adversaries from forming blocs.\n\nThis strategy was also implemented in the East. They greatly feared the Japan-Manchukuo-China economic bloc and thus continued to cultivate their influence within China. America, while building its own American bloc, extended its economic influence, allied with Chongqing, and adopted an attitude of obstructing the establishment of the East Asian economic bloc. This approach became increasingly blatant after the outbreak of the China Incident, eventually leading them to start an undeclared war against Japan. That is, having completely established their own bloc, they not only stopped providing materials to Japan from that bloc but also maneuvered Chongqing to prevent us from obtaining resources from the East Asian bloc, namely Japan-Manchukuo-China, for our self-sufficiency. Furthermore, despite the fact that obtaining resources from the wider region of the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, including the Southern regions, was an unavoidable necessity for our self-preservation in response to American economic pressure, both Britain and America obstructed this, instigating the Dutch East Indies to halt oil exports. They did countless other things besides these.\n\nAs mentioned above, this current war is a war between blocs, an economic war; it is a war to determine whether the East Asian economic bloc can be established or not. Since Britain and America are strengthening their bloc economy in this way, the co-prosperity of Greater East Asia cannot exist unless an East Asian economic bloc centered on Japan is formed. Meanwhile, Germany and Italy, in response to the Anglo-Saxon bloc economy, are creating a bloc centered on Germany and Italy on the European continent. In concert with this, Great Japan is striving to break down the economic oppression by the Anglo-Saxons, that is, the old order, build a new order, and bring about the happiness and prosperity of Greater East Asia.\n\nNext, I would like to state my observations regarding the future prosecution of the war and the general preparedness required for it. The first question is, what will become of the China Incident? <63> What will become of Chongqing? How will the South Seas region come under our sphere of influence? The China Incident has already dragged on for four and a half years, yet Chongqing still remains. There are two reasons for this.\n\nThe first reason is that our country could not devote its full strength to the China Incident. That is, during the China Incident, we were unsure when unreasonable demands might come from the North or from Britain and America. We didn't know if military pressure might come, or if economic pressure might come. We had to conduct the China Incident while simultaneously preparing to respond to these possibilities. Therefore, although conquering Chongqing or Chengdu in one fell swoop would have been a simple matter, we did not do so and adopted a strategy of prolonged warfare.\n\nThe second reason is the continued assistance to Chongqing from third countries, especially military, financial, and economic aid from Britain and the United States. Therefore, even if Chongqing were taken, they would hold out in Chengdu. As long as the countries aiding Chiang Kai-shek did not change their stance, it was foreseen that the China Incident would continue indefinitely. Thus, instead of attempting to conquer Chongqing in one stroke, we applied pressure through a strategy of prolonged warfare.\n\nHowever, the situation has now completely changed. How has it changed? There is no need to explain in too much detail, but essentially, the only routes through which supplies are currently entering the Chongqing area are the Burma Route—the road entering Yunnan from Burma to the west of Thailand—and the route entering from the Soviet Union, namely via Outer Mongolia. These are the only two. But what about the Soviet Union? Due to its great war with Germany, it is now in no position to aid China. It cannot send aircraft or oil to China. It has reached a state where it must receive oil from America and is using British aircraft in Moscow. It is clear that the Soviet Union cannot aid China.\n\nWell then, can Britain and America aid China? This depends solely on the remaining Burma Route, but due to the mutual defense alliance between our country and Thailand, the Burma Route is now like a candle in the wind. It is uncertain when the Burma Route will be blockaded. I cannot say exactly when it will happen, but once it is blockaded, all aid to Chongqing will cease. Therefore, while I cannot say, not being a god, whether this will take years or months, it is now only a matter of time. In short, I state without hesitation that Chongqing's predicament will rapidly worsen. (Applause)\n\nNext, regarding the southern part of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, namely the South Seas region... the Philippines, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies area, what will become of them? The objective of this war, as stated in the Imperial Rescript <64>, is for self-preservation. If things continue as they are, the nation will perish, so we fight for self-reliance and self-preservation. One aspect of this self-reliance and self-preservation is resources. We must obtain resources. What about rice? Due to the stance of French Indochina and Thailand, there are no longer worries about rice; French Indochina and Thailand are rice-producing regions. Since a military alliance has been formed with French Indochina and Thailand, there are no concerns regarding rice. The only issue is how to transport it. What about oil and rubber? These exist in abundance in the South, and the sooner the conquest of the South proceeds, the sooner they will be in our hands. I say this very optimistically, but the time when we can use gasoline freely is indeed coming. Frankly, I did not expect the southern operations to progress this rapidly. In the Philippines, in Malaya, I was confident that the Imperial Army could occupy wherever it advanced, but I did not expect the landings in the Philippines to succeed so quickly. Or that landings in Malaya could be achieved so swiftly. Or that Kowloon, opposite Hong Kong, would fall so rapidly. This is truly due to His Majesty's great authority, but also because our Navy gained command of the sea in that area, and the attacks by the Navy and Army overwhelmed the British forces, striking enemy airfields at the outset, shooting down enemy aircraft in the air, and already reducing their air power to less than half, thus swiftly achieving air superiority. Regarding warships, Britain, to display its superiority, sent warships all the way to the East, but they were immediately destroyed by our naval air units at the outset. Also in Hawaii, the main force of the US Pacific Fleet, which was waiting to come out to the Philippine area at any time to defeat the Japanese Navy, was destroyed by Japan's naval air units and submarines. Consequently, the American Navy can no longer advance into the South Seas region. Britain is apparently dispatching one 10,000-ton cruiser as a replacement for the sunken capital ships, but this seems like sending it to be destroyed. (Applause) If they come bit by bit, we'll destroy them bit by bit as they come. If they come in force, the Navy seems prepared to destroy them in force. Given this situation, I imagine that the Army's operations in the Philippines and Malaya will proceed with tremendous momentum hereafter, as the situation at sea and in the air is as described. Therefore, I believe that bringing the Southern Co-Prosperity Sphere into our hands will also occur in the near future. (Applause)\n\nConsequently, the end of the war in the East Asian region will come quickly. In short, the conclusion of the war in East Asia and the war in the South Seas will likely come extremely swiftly. What happens after that? At that point, using the resources obtained there, we must enhance the armaments of the Army and Navy, rapidly acquire materials necessary for national life and industrial development, <65> expand production, and complete preparations to respond to a prolonged war. We must create a posture where we can sustain the war no matter how many years it takes. If we establish that posture, the war, unexpectedly, may not be prolonged. If our prolonged war posture is established and the enemy's prolonged war posture cannot be realized, the war will end quickly. This also depends on the progress of the war on the German side, but Germany too will steadily proceed with putting pressure on Britain as planned. If they approach western India via Iran and Turkey, take Egypt, seize the Suez Canal, and take Gibraltar, Britain will surrender even without a landing operation on the British mainland. What happens if they surrender? There's nothing left but to disintegrate or flee. Where will they flee? To Australia, Canada, and then merge with America, or disintegrate. At that point, if our prolonged war system is established, no matter how much money America has, it cannot carry out a prolonged war. (Applause) Therefore, the most crucial thing for us is to swiftly establish a prolonged war system.\n\nFurthermore, while various factors may contribute to such an advantageous development of the war situation, we must always keep in mind the fierce and tragic battles of the frontline officers and soldiers. The fierce and tragic circumstances are not often reported in the newspapers. What is the reality? The Japanese planes that attacked Hawaii flew close enough to crash into warships, daringly penetrating the hail of enemy anti-aircraft fire. They did not attack with the intention of returning alive. (Applause) We have already lost a considerable number of our aircraft in the Hawaii area. That is, we are paying considerable sacrifices to achieve victory. Also, from the Army's perspective, during the Philippine landing operations, the enemy was prepared on land. Although we received support from warships and aircraft, the landing troops boarded small boats, landed on shore, and immediately clashed with the enemy. They had to advance over the corpses of their comrades to succeed in the landing. A landing where there is absolutely no enemy is a surprise landing. This is what we hope for most, but the enemy is also vigilant. If they learn of a landing there, they dispatch troops by truck and bring in tanks. Thus, we must never forget that the success of the landings was achieved by overcoming considerable sacrifices, stepping over corpse after corpse. We on the home front must further steel ourselves, keeping in mind the spirit of the frontline officers and soldiers who offer their lives to His Majesty to defeat the enemy. (Applause)\n\nCurrently, since most enemy aircraft have been destroyed, there has not been a single air raid on Japanese territory since the start of the war. However, <66> it seems they have come close, but ultimately there has not been a single bombing, and even if they come here, they flee back. This is truly fortunate. However, this situation will certainly not last long. The enemy, Britain and America, are formidable opponents. Therefore, we must be prepared for the possibility that at some point, they will naturally be able to carry out air raids somewhere in our Japanese Empire or disrupt communications using submarines. We must not panic in such situations. It is to be expected. When we have dealt a severe blow to them, it is natural that they should deal some blow to us in return. Even in a fight, if you hit the opponent on the head and knock them down, it's natural to get hit yourself and bleed a little. There is no such convenient war where you defeat the enemy without getting hurt yourself or needing even a single bandage. Therefore, we must be fully prepared for attacks from the enemy. And it is necessary to have the mindset of hitting them hard when they do come.\n\nAnother point is that currently, we face no inconveniences in our daily lives yet, but until the establishment of the prolonged war system, various materials and other things will become somewhat more inconvenient than now. Taxes will have to be paid a little more. More government bonds will have to be bought. This situation is unavoidable. It is too much to hope to establish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere without making such sacrifices. The nation must inevitably make sacrifices, and only then can the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere be established. Therefore, it is extremely necessary for those on the home front to endure various hardships, sharing the spirit of the frontline soldiers who throw away their lives into the midst of the enemy, and to unite in spirit. (Applause)\n\nNext, I would like to state my frank request that I mentioned at the beginning. While the majority of the 24 million people of the Peninsula are acting admirably as subjects of the Empire, there is a portion among them who, perhaps swayed by foreign machinations or failing to recognize the current situation, still exhibit some awkwardness in uniting as one. I have considered where the cause of this might lie. One thing I think is this. That Britain and America are large countries, rich, and great nations. Until now... and even now, perhaps there are still quite a few people who think that Britain and America are quite strong. Indeed, America's economic power is immense. Its number of warships was ten to Japan's six. The number is large. People who think America is strong consider it from the perspective of numbers. For example, here are ten apples. Here are six. Which is more? Indeed, ten is more. However, upon close inspection, perhaps the ten are rotten, while the six are all delicious apples <67> and solid. (Laughter) Without considering such things, they have maintained the feeling that ten is large all along. It's natural to think this way; in fact, Japan too, faced with America's powerful economic pressure, thought they were strong, which is why we endured until now. But looking under the lid, they aren't that impressive, are they? (Laughter, applause)\n\nNext is Britain. They are tenacious. From that small island, they gradually invaded the East, defeating Portugal and Spain, subjugating China, and invading India, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Their naval power was also ten to Japan's six. However, how much power does Britain possess now? Also due to the war with Germany, they are actually raising their hands like this. (Raises both hands halfway) They are on the verge of surrender. Therefore, extending their power to the East is quite impossible. Their struggle now is where to halt the loss of their existing power. They must abandon Hong Kong. They intend to hold Singapore to the very end. But can they? That is, they are already a country without the strength to hold onto anything east of Singapore. However, since their underlying strength is considerable, they might manage something, but no matter what, their candle flame is flickering out. Despite this, I wonder if there aren't people who still feel that Britain and America are strong. I request that you thoroughly examine this, and if there are those who hold the mistaken preconception that Britain and America are extremely strong and Japan can do nothing, I ask for your guidance in urging them to discard it.\n\nThe second thing I want to mention is that Japanese people... not just Japanese people, but people in general, tend to criticize things readily. They think, \"The government is saying that, but isn't it just propaganda?\" Or they think about doing this or that, \"Wouldn't it be better to do this? That approach seems wrong.\" Criticizing from a third-party perspective is fine in academia, but once war begins and the government's policy is decided, and the Army and Navy's policy is set, criticism is unacceptable. Criticizing as a third party is wrong. We must shift to action, asking only how we can realize the government's policy. How can we support the Army and Navy? (Applause) It's not criticism, but action. I heard something the other day. A news bulletin was posted in front of the Keijō Nippō Company office. It stated that two British battleships were sunk east of Malaya. The main force of the British Far East Fleet was annihilated in an instant. Then, a university student apparently said, \"Isn't this government propaganda? Isn't it a lie?\" (Laughter) Viewing the progress of the Imperial Army and Navy as potential propaganda stems, I believe, from a mind too <68> accustomed to third-party criticism. In this situation, the desirable attitude is to feel, \"We are one with the Army and Navy! Ah, how wonderful!\" But the fact that criticism emerges suggests to me, perhaps I'm being overly suspicious, that the feeling of fighting the war as one body is not yet fully formed. It must be trust, not criticism. We do not publish lies. If lies were published, the deception would later be exposed.\n\nThirdly, I want to say that bad people are extremely few. Good people are the vast majority. Those bad people engage in various agitations and turn even good people bad. So, what is the root cause of these bad people? There may be various reasons, but it likely stems from a lack of understanding. So, what should be done to provide understanding? This must be approached from two directions. Schools and other institutions do a good job, but beyond that, you leaders must firmly impart understanding. Another aspect is managing things well within the family. Wives should provide firm and good guidance within the home. Simultaneously, you leaders should set certain targets, identify areas that seem a bit problematic, \"Their thinking over there seems a bit off,\" and pull them up towards these defined goals, making them better, uniting them as one. Guiding through defined targets. Generally speaking, good people don't need to be told to follow. They follow without being told. Therefore, I believe it is the crucial duty of you leaders to carefully observe those who seem to be looking aside or acting strangely, and to vigorously whip them into line and pull them along.\n\nFinally, I want to say that our country has always united whenever a national crisis arises. The political strife in Japan around Meiji 22-23 (1889-1890) was severe. It went as far as taking lives. There were incidents like Hoshi Tōru being assassinated, quite a few. However, once the Sino-Japanese War or the Russo-Japanese War broke out, such things instantly disappeared. This is a characteristic feature of our country. Therefore, if there is a part of the country that is not united, they are not Imperial subjects. That is, those who do not conform to the spirit characteristic of our Imperial subjects—uniting when a national crisis arrives—are therefore not Imperial subjects. It is only when we become one solid mass that the unique character of our country can be fully ▼(阝+具 should be 顕) displayed. This might be acceptable in peacetime, but this is wartime. Moreover, it is the Greater East Asia War, aimed at establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The opponents are Britain and America, boasting of being the world's strongest. How can the nation not unite against them? We absolutely must unite. Those who do not unite are worms within the lion's body of the state. You all must unite, ensuring that not a single person fails to unite, fully demonstrating this characteristic of our country at this juncture.\n(Continued on lower section of page 91)\n\nContinuation of \"The Greater East Asia War and the Peninsular Populace\" (Continued from page 69)\nWe must display this fully. I earnestly request your passionate guidance regarding these matters. I have heard that some people have regrettably held unpleasant ideas like ethnic confrontation (民族的對立), but in this state of war, completely sweeping these away is the most crucial thing for Chōsen, and likely your most vital task. (Applause)\n\nThis has become rather long, but with these unreserved views added, I will conclude my talk. (Loud applause) <91>\n\n**Summary**\n\nMajor General Takahashi Tan, Chōsen Army Chief of Staff, argues that the Greater East Asia War is a necessary fight against Anglo-American economic dominance and the \"bloc system\" they impose while hypocritically preventing Japan from forming its own (the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere). He expresses extreme confidence in Japan's swift military victory, citing recent successes against the US and UK navies, the crippling of aid routes to Chongqing, and the anticipated rapid conquest of Southeast Asian resources. He calls upon the Korean populace (referred to as \"Peninsular populace\" and \"Imperial subjects\") to shed any remaining awe of Britain and America, cease criticizing government and military actions, trust official pronouncements, actively guide those with dissenting views, endure wartime hardships and sacrifices willingly, and achieve complete unity, eliminating any \"ethnic confrontation\" to support the war effort as loyal subjects of the Empire.\n\nFrom the perspective of Korean colonial history, this article is highly revealing. It starkly illustrates the Japanese military leadership's perspective and propaganda directed towards Koreans immediately after the start of the Pacific War. Historians would find interest in the explicit demands for Korean loyalty and assimilation (\"Imperial subjects,\" \"eliminate ethnic confrontation\"), the framing of the war not just as anti-Western imperialism but as a struggle between economic blocs, the supreme confidence expressed just weeks after Pearl Harbor, and the clear call to suppress any internal dissent or critical thought within the colony, identifying dissenters as \"worms within the lion's body.\" It showcases the intensification of assimilation policies and the mobilization of colonial subjects under the banner of total war.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n高橋坦\tタカハシ タン\tTakahashi Tan\n朝鮮軍\tチョウセングン\tChōsen Army\n陸軍少將\tリクグンショウショウ\tArmy Major General\n半島\tハントウ\tPeninsula (Korea)\n府民舘\tフミンカン\tFumin Hall\n全鮮\tゼンセン\tAll

高橋坦\n本日、進んで半島二千四百萬の指導に膺られんとする有力なる皆樣方の前で講演を致しますることは、私の洵に光榮とする所であります。\n大東亞戰爭に關する帝國の必勝態勢、殊に我が陸海軍の必勝、國民の必勝信念等に付きましては、去る十二月一日この府民舘に於て講演を致しマイクを通じて全鮮に私の所見を述べて置きましたので、これに付ては本日申しません。又開戰に當つて今次戰爭に對する朝鮮軍の態度に付きましてはこれ亦十二月八日新聞、及びラデオを通じて朝鮮軍は外敵の侵入に對して何んどきでもこれに應じ擊摧し得る體制を確立してゐる。又半島の治安の確保に付ては萬遺憾なき準備があるといふ點を軍司令官談話として發表せらましたので、この點に付きましても本日こゝで皆樣にお話申上げることは省略致させて頂きます。\n本日申上げんとする所は、その一つは大東亞戰淨の重大性といふことであります。次の一つは大東亞戰爭に對する半島二千四百萬に對する私の赤裸々なる希望、この二つを申上げたいと存ずるのであります。\nその第一の大東亞戰爭の重大性でありますが、最近二三十年來の世界の情勢は大體一國對一國の戰爭でなくなつた。この前の歐洲戰爭からさうであります。即ち數國＜62＞對數國の戰爭になつてをる。單に戰爭のみならず平時の經濟狀態、國民の幸福を圖る爲の方策、總てブロツク態制になつてをります。即ちアングロサクソンの英米は英米のブロツクを作り、又、ソビエドのブロツクを作るといふような狀態に進んで參つたのであります。\n然るに英米はこの前の歐洲戰爭の結末の際、民族自決といふ政策を揭げて、自分等以外の國にブロツク經濟を作り得ないやうに押付けてしまひました。そして無暗に小さい國を造り上げた、結局その小さい國を自分等の勢力下に置いて、而も他の國々の中間に存在させてブロツクの結成を破つたのであります。即ち自分等のほうはブロツクを結成して、相手方にはブロツクを結成させない方策である。\n東洋に方てもその方策が行はれて、日滿支の經濟ブロツクといふものを非常に恐れて、さうして支那の中に依然として自分等の勢力を扶殖し、アメリカはアメリカブロツクを作りながら、自分等の經濟勢力を延長し重慶と結んで東亞經濟ブロツクの成立を阻害するといふ態度を執つて來たのであります。このやり方が支那事變勃發後逐次に露骨になつて參りまして、遂に日本に對して宣傳を布告せざる戰を始めて參つたのであります。即ち自分等はすつかりブロツクを作つて置いて、そしてそのブロツクからは日本に對する物資の提供をやらないのみならず。我々が東亞ブロツク、即ち日滿支から物を取り自ら自活をする、それを取らせないやうに重慶を仕向けてをつた。又アメリカの經濟壓迫に對處し東亞の共榮圈、即ち南方方面を含めてのこの廣い區域から物資を獲得することは自存上己むを得ざる狀況なるに拘ちす英米兩國はこれを妨害をし、蘭印を使嗾して石油輸出を中止させたのであります。その他擧げて數ふべからざることをやつたのであります。\n以上の如く今度の戰爭はブロツク對ブロツク經濟戰爭であり、東亞經濟ブロツクが出來るか出來ないかといふ戰であります。英米が斯の如くブロツク經濟の强化をなす以上、日本を中心とする東亞ブロツク經濟を結成しなければ大東亞の共榮は存立しない。一方獨伊に於てはアングロサクソンのブロツク經濟に對して獨伊を中心とする歐洲大陸に於けるブロツクを作りつゝある。これと相呼應して所謂アングロサクソンに依る經濟壓迫、即ち舊體制を打破し新しい新秩序を建設し大東亞の幸福と繁榮を招來すベく大日本は努力してをる次第であります。\n次に今後の戰爭遂行に關しての私の觀察、並にこれに對する一般的覺悟といふやうなものに付て申上げたいと思ひます。その第一は支那事變はどうなるであらうか、＜63＞重慶はどうなるであらうか、南洋方面は如何にして我が勢力下に這入るであらうかといふことであります。支那事變は旣に四半半掛りましたが、重慶は依然として殘存してをります。これには二つの理由があります。\nその第一は我國が支那事變に全力を盡し得なかつたことであります。即ち支那事變途中、何時北方或は英米から如何なる理不盡なる要求が參るかも知らん。武力的壓迫が來るかも知らん。經濟的壓迫が來るかも知らん。これに對應するの準備をやりつゝ支那事變をやつて行かなければならぬ狀態でありますから、一擧に重慶を屠る、成都を屠るのは朝飯前でありましたが、それをやらないで所謂長期戰の方式を採つて來たのであります。\nもう一つの原因は重慶に對する第三國の援助特に英國米國の武器或は金融經濟上の援助が繼續された事であります。從つて譬へ重慶を取りましても成都に頑張る。援蔣諸國がその態度を變へぬ限り、支那事變はどこまでも繼續するといふ見透しがいつたので、一擧重慶を屠るといふことをやらずに長期戰の方式で重慶に壓迫を加へたのであります。\n然るに今や事態は一變致しました、どういふ風に變つたが、餘り詳しく申述べるまでもなく要するに現在重慶方面に物が這入つてをりますのはビルマルート即泰國の西方ビルマから雲南に這入る道と、ソビエツトから這入る即外蒙方面より這る道の二つしかないのであります。所がソビエツトはどうかと申しますと、ドイツとの大戰爭に依りまして、今は支那援助どころの騷ぎではない、支那に對して飛行機を送るとか、或は石油を送るどろではない。石油をアメリカから貰なければならない。モスクワでイギリスの飛行機を使つてをるといふ狀態で、ソビエツトの支那援助の出來ないことは明瞭であります。\n然らば英米の支那援助は出來るか、これは只一つ残されたビルマルートに依るのでありますが、これは我國と泰國との功守同盟に依つてビルマルートは將に風前の燈であります。何どきビルマルートは封鎖されるか分らん。何時頃になるかわかりませんが、それが封鎖されたならば、こゝに重慶に對する援助といふものは一切なくなる。從つて私はこれを何年で參るか、或は何ケ月で參るだらうといふやうなことは、神ならぬ身である以上申上げられませんが、もう時日の問題であります。要するに重慶の困り方が急激に變つて來ることは斷言して憚らぬ所であります。(拍手)\n次には共榮圈の中の南方の部分即南洋方面……フイリピン、馬來、蘭領インド方面は一體どうなるであらうか、これは今次の戰爭目的が、御詔書にもありましたや＜64＞うに、自存の爲にやる、この儘行つては國が亡びる、だから自立自存の爲にやる、その自立自存夼の一つは資源である。物を手に入れなければならぬのでありますが米はどうか。佛印泰の態度から米は心配はなくなつた、佛印泰は米の産地である。その佛印と泰とは軍事同盟が出來たから、米に關しては心配はない、只これを如何にして運ぶかが問題であります。石油、ゴムはどうなるか、これは南方に豐富に存在するのであつて、この南方の功略が早ければ早い程、早く手に這入る。私は非常に樂觀的に申しますが、ガソリンがどん〱使へる時機が事實に於て來るのであります。私は實は南方の作戰がこんなに迅速に進展するものとは思ふてゐなつたのであります。フイリツピンでも、馬來でも、皇軍の向ふ所占領することの出來る自信はありましたが、斯の如く速にフイリツピンに上陸が成功する。或は斯の如く速に馬來に上陸が出米る。斯の如く速に香港對岸の九龍が陷ちたるとは思はなかつた。それは實に大御稜威の然らしむる所でありますが、又我が海軍があの方面に於て制海權を獲得したことゝ海軍及陸軍の功擊が英軍を壓倒して劈頭敵の飛行場を叩き、空中に於て敵機を擊墜し、旣に彼等の航空勢力は半分以下になつてしまつたといふ程、迅速に空中に於ける優勢を占めた。軍艦に於ても英國は優勢を誇示する爲に遙々軍艦を東洋に送つて來たが、劈頭我が海軍航空隊の爲にやられ、又ハワイに於ても、何時でもフイリツピン方面に出て來て、日本海軍を擊破せんと待構へてをつた米國の太平洋艦隊の主力は、日本の海軍航空隊及潜水艦の爲に擊破された。從つて今や南洋方面に對してアメリカ海軍が進航して來ることは出來なくなつてしまひました。イギリスでは擊沈された主力艦の補充として一萬トン巡洋艦一隻廻航するこのことでありますが、これもやられに來るやうなものであります。(拍手)チビリチビリ來たやつは片端からチビリチビリやつつける。大擧して來れば大擧やつつけるといふ準備は海軍に出來てをるやうであります。斯の如き狀態でありますから、陸軍のフイリツピンに於ける作戰、馬來に於ける作戰も、海上及空中が斯の如くでありますから、爾後非常な勢を以て進展して行ふものと想像します。故に南方共榮圈を我が手に收めることはこれ亦近い將來に來ることゝ私は信じてをる。(拍手)\n從つて東亞を地域とする戰爭の終結は早く來る。詰り東亞に於ける戰爭南洋に於ける戰爭の結末は極めて迅速に來るであらう。その後はどうなるか。その時はそこで取つた資源で陸海軍の軍備を增强し、又國家生活上必要なる、或は工業發展上必要な資材をどん〱取つて生＜65＞産擴充をやつて行き、そして長期戰に應ずる準備を整へなければならぬ。戰爭は何年掛つても大丈夫だといふ態勢を作らなければならぬ。その態勢を作つて置きますれば案外戰爭は長期にならない。こちらの長期戰態勢が確立し、そして向ふの長期戰の態勢が出來なければ戰爭は短期に終る。これは一方ドイツ方面の戰爭の進展如何にも關係致しまするが、ドイツも豫定通りどん〱英國壓迫をやつて行く。イラン、トルコ方面から印度の西に迫りエヂプトを取り、スエズ運河を抑へてジブラルタルを取るといふ狀態になれば、英本土に對する上陸作戰をやらないでも英國は參つて了ふ。參つたらどうなる、分裂するか逃げるか外はない。何處に逃げるか、濠洲、カナダに逃げる、さうしてアメリカに合體するか、分裂するかになつた時分に、こちらに長期戰體制が出來てをるならば、幾らアメリカに金があつても、長期戰は遂行出來ないのであります。(拍手)從つて我が方としては一番大事なものは、速に長期戰體制を確立することにあるのであります。\n尙ほ斯の如き有利な戰局の展開は色々なことが原因でありませうが、我々はその中で第一線將兵の激烈悲壯な戰鬪を何時も頭に置いて置かなければならん。激烈悲壯な狀况は新聞にも餘り出ません。事實はどうか、ハワイを攻擊した日本の飛行機は軍艦にぶつかる迄近くに行つて、敵の高角砲の彈雨の中を潛つて敢行した、生きて歸る積りで攻轚をやつたのではありません。(拍手)旣にハワイ方面でも相當數の我飛行機を失つてをるのである。即ち勝利を得る爲に相當な犧牲を拂つてをるのである。又陸軍方面から言ひましても、フイリツピン上陸作戰に於ても敵は陸上に準備をしてをり、こちらは軍艦及び飛行機で援助はして貰ひますが、上陸する部隊は小さな舟に乘つて陸に揚つて直ぐ敵とぶつかる。逐次揚つて味方の死骸を乘越えて前に進まなければ上陸は出來ないのであります。これが全然敵のをらない所に上睦出來るのは奇襲的上陸であります。これを一番希望しているのでありますが、敵もさるもの矢張り警戒してをる。あすこに上陸して來たといへば、自動車で兵力を廻し、タンクを持つて行くといふ風にやるので、相當な犧牲を拂つて、死骸を乘越え乘越えて上陸に成功したのであることを我々は決して忘れてはならないのであります。身命を陛下に捧げて敵をやつつけるといふ第一線將兵の氣持を我々の頭に置いて銃後の者は一層の緊張をしなければならんと思ふのであります。(拍手)\n現在は敵の飛行機が大半やつつけられましたから、日本領土に對する空襲は開戰以來一回もありません。併し＜66＞近所までは來たらしいが結局爆擊は一回もなく、又こちらの方に來ても逃げて歸つてをる。洵に仕合せであります。併し斯ういふ狀態は決して長く續くものでありません。敵も英國、米國といへば相當なものである。故に或る時期には我が日本帝國の何處かに對して空襲をやり、或は潜水艦に依つて父通を破壞するといふ位なことは當然やり得るものと覺悟してをらなければならん。さういふ場合に周章狼狽してはならないのであります。當り前のことである。こちらは向ふに非常な打擊を與へた時には向ふが、こちらに少し位打擊を與へるのは當り前である。喧嘩でも向ふの頭を叩いてぶつ倒せば、その時分には自分の方も叩かれて血が少しは出るのが當り前である。こちらがちつとも怪我をせずに膏藥一つも貼らんで向ふだけやつつけるといふ虫のいい戰さはありません。故に敵からの攻擊は十分覺悟してをらなければならん。そして來た時にウントやつつけるといふ氣持でをることが必要であります。\n今一つは現在は未だ何等生活上不便もありませんが、これが長期戰體制の確立迄に色々な物資その他多少今よりは不便になる、稅金も少し餘計出さにやならん。公債も餘計買はにやならんといふ狀態になる。これは己むを得ません。それだけの犧牲を拂はずして大東共榮圈の確立をしようなんて虫がよ過ぎるのであります。どうしても國民は犧牲を拂つて、さうして初めて大東亞共榮圈が成立するのでありますから、第一線の將兵が生命を棄てゝ敵の中に飛込む氣持を有つて、銃後に於ける色々な不自由を忍び、さうして心持を一つにしてやつて行くことが極めて必要であると考へるのであります。(拍手)\n次に最初申しました私の赤裸々なるお願を申上げたいと存じます。半島二千四百萬の人々の大部分の方は立派に皇國臣民としてやつて行つてをりますが、中に一部分の者は外國の策動に乘ぜられ或はその他現時の情勢を認識しない結果、一體になつて行くといふ所に多少未だ工合の惡い所があるんぢやないか、その原因は何處にあらうかといふことを私は觀察して見た。その一つは私は斯うだと思ふ。それは英米といふ國は大きな國で金持で偉い國だ。今迄は……現在でも矢張り英米といふ國は相當强いものたといふ風に考へてをる人が未だ相當にあるんぢやないか。成る程米國の經濟力は偉大でなります。軍艦の數日本六に對して十であつた。數は多い。米國を强いんだと考へる人は數の上から考へる。これは例へばこゝに林檎が十ある。こゝに六つある。どつちが多いが、成程これは十のほうが多い。所がこれは仔細な點檢して見ると十のほうは腐つてをるが、六つはみな美味しい林＜67＞檎でがつちりしてをる。(笑聲)といふやうなことは考へないで十が大きいといふ感じて今迄ずつと考へて來た。斯う考へるのは當然で、實は日本もアメリカの强豪な經濟壓迫に對して矢張り强いと思つてをつたから今迄辛抱して來た。併し蓋を明けて見ると大したものぢやないでありませんか。(笑聲拍手)\n次にイギリスでありますがこれは粘り强い。あの小さな島で逐次に東洋を侵略してポルトガル、スペインをやつつけ、支那をやつつけ、印度、シンガポール、香深を侵略して來た。その海軍力は矢張り日本の六に對する十である。併しそのイギリスは今どれだけの勢力を有つてをるか。これもドイツとの戰爭で實はこの位手を擧げてをる。(兩手を半ば迄擧げる)將に降參する狀態になつてをる。從つて東洋に勢力を伸ばさうといふことはとても出來ない。今ある勢力を何處で喰止めるかが彼等の苦心してをる所である。香港も捨てなければならん。シンガポールは何處迄も有たうと考へてをる。がどうですか、有てん、即ちシンガポール以東を有つ力が旣にない國である。併しながら底力が强いから何とかやつて來るかも知りませんが、併し何といつても蠟燭の火の消えかゝつてをる。これ等の英米に對して英米は未だ强いんだといふやうな感じを有るてをる人があるんぢやないかと思ふのであります。これに付て十分御檢討を願ひ、若し左樣に英米が非常に强いものだ、日本はどうすることも出來ないといふ誤つたる先入感を有つてをるならば捨てろといふことを御指導願ひたいのであります。\n次に第二番目に申上げたいことは兎角日本人は……日本人だけでありませんが、ものをよく批判する。政府があんなことを言つてるが宣傳ではないかといふ風に考へる。或はあゝすりや斯うする。斯うすればいゝではないか、あれはどうもいかんといふやうなことを考へる。第三者的に批判することは學問では宜しい、けれども戰爭となつて政府の方針で決まり、陸海軍の方針が決まれば批判をすることはいけません。第三者として批判することはいけない。一に政府の方針を如何にして我々が實現しやうか。陸海軍を如何にして支援して行かうといふ實行に移らなければなりません。(拍手)批判でなく實行であります。この間斯ういふことを聞きました。京城日報社の前に戰爭のニユースの揭示が出ました。マレーの東方に於て英國の戰艦二隻を擊沈した。英國の東洋艦隊主力は瞬時にして殲滅したとあつた所が、或る大學生がこれは政府の宣傳ではないか、噓ぢやないか。(笑聲)と言つてをつた。帝國陸海軍の發展を宣傳ではないかといふ眼を以て見るのは、私は第三者として批判をする頭が餘＜68＞りにこりついてをるからで、この場合我々は陸海軍と一しよなんだ。あゝ嬉しいといふ氣持が出ることが望ましいのでありますが、批判が出るといふことは、私は未だ氣持が一體になつて戰をするといふ氣持になつてゐないんぢやないか。少し邪推かも知りませんがその話を聞いて左樣に感じました。批判ではなく信賴でなければならぬ。噓を發表しやせん。噓を發表すれば化の皮が後で露はれる。\n次に第三に申上げたいことは惡い人は極く少い。いゝ人ばかりが多い。その惡い人が色々煽動をしていゝ人迄惡くする。そこで惡い人は一體何處に原因があるか、これは色々ありませうが。矢張り認識不足から來る。そこで認識を與へる爲にどうするか、これは二つの方面で行かなければならぬ。學校その他で旨くやりますが、それ以外に皆さんの指導者側で認識をしつかり與へなければならぬ。もう一つは家庭で旨くやつて行く。家庭で奥さんがしつかりよく指導して行くと同時に、指導者たる皆さんが或る目標を決めて、あの邊が少し惡いぞ、あの邊の考が少し惡いやうだと限定した目標に向つた引上げて行く。そしていゝものにして行く。一體となつて行くといふ風に、限定目標に依つて指導して行く、全般的にいへばいゝ人には別に附いて來いと言ふ必要はありません。言はないでも附いて來る從つてどうも橫を向いてる少しおかしいといふやう方面をよく見て、これをうんと鞭韃し引つ張つて行くといふのが指導者皆さんの重大なる御任務ではないかと私は考へるのであります。\n最後に申上げたいことは我國は昔から國難一度來れば必ず一致團結する。明治二十二三年頃の日本政界の爭はひどかつた。命を取る迄行つたんです。或は星亨がやられたとか、隨分ありました。けれども一度日淸戰爭、日露戰爭が起ると、立ちどころに左樣なことが消えるのが我國の特色であります。從つて國内の一部分に一致しないのがあるとすれば、それは皇民でないことになるのであります。即ち我が皇民の特色である國難一度至れば一致する。その精神に一致しないものは從つて皇民でない。一丸になつて行く所に初めて我國の特色が遺憾なく▼(阝+具)はれるのでありまして、これが平時であればいざ知らず、戰時であります。而も大東亞共榮圈を確立しようとする大東亞戰爭であります。相手は世界最强を誇る英米であります。これに對して國民一致せずしてどうしますか。どうしても一致しなけれならぬ。一致しない者は國家の獅文身中の虫であります。やはり皆さんが皆一致して行く、一人と雖一致しない者はないといふ我國特色をこの際遺憾な(九一頁下段に繼續)\n「大東亞戰爭と半島民衆」の繼續(六九頁より繼續)\nく發揮しなければなりません。これらに付て皆さんの熱烈な御指導が願ひたいと考へるのであります。從來徃々にして民族的對立といふやうな愉快でない考を有つた人が一部にあるといふことを聞きましたが、もうこの戰爭狀態に於ては全くこれを一掃してしまふことが、朝鮮として最も大事なことであり、皆樣の最も重大なる任務であらうと、私は考へるのであります。(拍手)\n甚だ長くなりましたが以上、私の遠慮ない所見を附加へまして、お話を終ることに致します。(大拍手)＜91＞\n＜62-69,

Populace"},{"path":"89_14.01_1942.01/090.txt","issue":"89_14.01_1942.01","content":"A Travelogue of Taiwan and Central China, After a Month and a Half Journey Through Various Places\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCentral Advisory Council Member Goson Shō'u (Lawyer Yi Sŭng'u)\n\nI recently traveled to Taiwan and China, and regarding what I observed during this trip, I would like to mention two or three points for your reference. The purpose of my trip was to inspect the industrial situation in Taiwan, the living and industrial conditions of Koreans residing in China, and also to comfort the Imperial Army (皇軍).\n\nRegarding comforting the Imperial Army, I will leave that for another occasion and speak about other matters.\n\nFirst, I went to Taiwan. What is completely different from here is the climate. As you may know, Taiwan is divided into three zones: tropical, subtropical, and temperate. Most of the places I visited were subtropical, and there was a pillar standing exactly between Taichū and Tainan, which I was told is a marker indicating the border between the tropical and subtropical zones. There was a similar marker on Mount Aheishan (阿黑山), which marks the border between the temperate and subtropical zones.\n\nTaiwan is like this, as mentioned before, so when we went, the climate felt like late August here. Of course, we prepared summer clothes, but if one were to think summer clothes are unnecessary because it's cold here <70> and not bring them, I believe they would face great difficulty. Despite such a climate, there is no need to worry about padded clothing or heating.\n\nWhen I asked a teacher at a certain elementary school (國民學校) what the biggest difficulty was there, they said it was teaching the students about snow, as they cannot see the real thing. This was the biggest problem. Taiwan is truly a land of everlasting summer. Various chemical research institutions have been established here, and the facilities are thorough. I believe the desire to have more money invested in such fields for research in Chosŏn is not just my hope alone.\n\nNow, in this region, agriculture and industry are extremely prosperous, with rice and sugar cultivation being prominent.\n\nRice is grown twice here, and the second harvest yields about 70-80% of the first crop. Growing rice twice is called *tahonchi* (タホンチ) there. It is planted in March and harvested in June, then planted in June and harvested in November.\n\n◇\n\nWhen we visited, the rice was ripening and being harvested. In the Tainan and Takao areas of Taiwan, neither the planting nor the harvesting times are fixed. That is, looking at the situation, some fields had been planted only a month ago, while others were being harvested.\n\nSugar cultivation seemed to be in as good condition as rice cultivation. Sugar is called *kamotcha* (カモツチヤ) there, and it is harvested about a year and a half after planting. For your reference, the price of rice in Keelung was 36 yen, 42 sen, 5 rin per koku, which is considerably cheaper compared to Chosŏn rice. Hōrai rice (蓬萊米) is said to be of very good quality, although perhaps slightly inferior to Chosŏn's. Rice there is also subject to rationing; previously, they rationed up to 1.8 *gō* per person, but recently it has reached 2.3 *gō*.\n\nThis is mostly because a large portion is exported to the mainland (内地 - Japan), and Taiwan, like Chosŏn, serves as a supply base for our country. The rice conservation efforts in Taiwan are quite remarkable.\n\nNext, regarding forestry, vast mountains covered with giant trees grow thickly, and seeing the mountains there after seeing the mountains of Chosŏn is truly startling. Forestry is mostly managed by the Forestry Bureau (營林署), and they operate on a large scale, having laid a railway up to the summit of Mount Aheishan. Looking out from the train window, there were bamboo forests covering tens of thousands of *tsubo* on the mountainside. These bamboos are much larger compared to those in Chosŏn and are currently fulfilling the demand for Japanese food products.\n\nAmong Taiwan's trees, the one with the widest range of uses is the cypress (檜 - Hinoki), and Taiwan is very blessed with such trees. That is, whichever house you look at, the very pleasant <71> scent of wood strikes your nose.\n\nAs for fruits, I saw many rare ones whose names I didn't know. First, there's something called *beiyū* (ベーユウ), which is sweet and good. *Bundan* (ブンダン), also very sweet, costs roughly between 80 sen and 1 yen. Additionally, there are melons, pineapples, sapodilla (サボヂラ), papaya (パパイヤ), ponkan (ポンカン), bananas (バナナ), and many other types. Also, although not a fruit, something similar called betel nut (ビンロウ - Binrō) was seen.\n\nI had expected that once I got there, I would be able to eat my fill of extremely delicious bananas, but I was completely betrayed; I almost felt that the ones sold here are better.\n\nThe reason for this is that the higher-grade varieties are exported to the mainland. Bananas grown commercially are fertilized, so the fruit is large and the quality is good, but those that grow naturally in the mountains are not fertilized and are therefore small. However, this doesn't mean the taste is inferior; there's no particular difference. In any case, the abundance of fruit is truly enviable.\n\nNext, the rivers there are completely dry. That is, even if it rains once, the water flows away, leaving behind a wide, devastated area.\n\nI believe there is a need to manage these wastelands. When I mentioned this to the Governor-General, he agreed on the matter but said that it involves considerable expense and cannot be done immediately. He mentioned plans to implement measures gradually.\n\n◇\n\nNext is about the Taiwanese people. They can be divided into two groups. One is the so-called raw savages (生蕃) (referred to as the Takasago-zoku (高砂族) there), with about 150,000 currently residing there. The others are all immigrants from China, fundamentally Chinese. There are about six million of these people residing there. (*Translator's Note: The figure 600人 seems extremely low and likely a typo for 600萬人, six million, which aligns with population estimates of the time for the Han Chinese population in Taiwan*).\n\nPutting aside the raw savages for later, let's talk about the Taiwanese who are Chinese. Their lives seem relaxed, and their homes are splendid.\n\nTaihoku's Taihei-chō is a place where many Chinese gather, much like Chungno in Kyŏngsŏng, but in various aspects, it is far more prosperous than Chungno. The lives of Chinese people in other areas are also affluent.\n\nIn any case, a very good condition in Taiwan is that clothing expenses are unnecessary. Unlike clothing in the mainland, undergarments and padded items are completely unnecessary, which must be a great help economically. Furthermore, they do not need coal or charcoal for their living, and their lifestyle is Chinese-style, making it very simple. Consequently, there is nothing but making money. <72>\n\nIn Tainan, guided by someone, I visited a Taiwanese home. Mainly observing the lower and middle classes, the lives of the lower class are not much different from those in Chosŏn. That is, they sleep and live on wooden floors, simple itself.\n\nWhen I inquired there, the man of the house was employed somewhere and had an income of about 40 to 50 yen per month. On the way back, the guide told me that although the external appearance of their lifestyle seems poor, the substance is fulfilling. Looking at Taiwan as a whole, the Taiwanese appeared outwardly poorer than their actual means. I believe we Chosŏn people must take this as a significant reference.\n\nRegarding clothing style, previously everything was Chinese attire, but recently, there has been encouragement to change all of this. Efforts are being made, just like encouraging colored clothing instead of white clothes in Chosŏn. It is said that Chinese clothing is absolutely not permitted when entering government offices, so they wear Western clothes. However, it seems that getting even the elderly to wear Western clothes has not been thoroughly implemented, as some were observed wearing Chinese attire.\n\n◇\n\nNow, regarding the state of education dissemination, currently, those receiving primary education represent 60% of the total. Compulsory education will be implemented from the 1943 fiscal year (Shōwa 18), and it is expected to bring very good results. Furthermore, to accommodate those currently unable to attend elementary school (國民學校), institutions called Kōmin Juku (皇民塾 - Imperial Subjects' Cram Schools) have been established, educating people from ages six to sixty. What I found interesting about their teaching method is that while our education system has fixed study periods, these Kōmin Juku do not have set durations. That is, they keep students there and teach them for however many years it takes until they can converse using the national language (國語 - Japanese). I think this method might be more effective than forced teaching. The pronunciation of the national language by people there is inevitably inferior to that of Chosŏn people; the Chinese accent has not disappeared.\n\nWe visited the Government-General and met the Director of the Industrial Promotion Bureau. At that time, the Director praised us, saying, \"In Taiwan too, we are promoting the national language, but there are few people who can speak it as clearly and skillfully as you do.\" We were quite humbled. This also shows how clear the pronunciation of Chosŏn people is.\n\nRegarding ideology, many of the Taiwanese here, as mentioned before, are not originally Taiwanese but came from China, and in case of emergency, they only think about returning to their home country. Consequently, they used to call people from mainland China \"great countrymen\" (大國人), and even when the China Incident (支那事變) broke out, they believed that \"Our great country is X-ing Japan\" (*censored/illegible in original*) and that all of Japan would become X's (*censored/illegible*), and this Taiwan would also become China's X (*censored/illegible*). That is, even when newspapers reported Japan's consecutive victories, <73> they were convinced it was misinformation. However, later, when they heard from interpreters that Japan was actually advancing victoriously, they began to realize that their \"great country\" was losing.\n\nPreviously, Taiwanese people living in Guangdong (廣東省) and Fujian (福建省) provinces were ordered by the consulate to withdraw to Taiwan before the Incident began. However, believing themselves to be originally Chinese and having many relatives there, they trusted they would absolutely not be killed by Chiang Kai-shek (蔣介石) and did not follow the consulate's orders. However, Chiang Kai-shek did not think so; he said Taiwanese are Japanese, therefore they are traitors (奸漢), and because of this, many were killed. It is said, however, that some Taiwanese did act as spies (偵探) for Japan and actually performed such work.\n\nHowever, having suffered harshly under Chiang Kai-shek, they finally realized Japan's righteousness and began to think of trusting Japan in the future. Now, it seems they are striving to become respectable nationals (國民). Therefore, regarding ideology, there are currently no concerns.\n\n◇\n\nNext, great effort is being put into things like the National Total Mobilization Movement (國民總力運動). Since June of this year, an organization similar to Chosŏn's National Total Mobilization League, called the Imperial Subjects' Public Service Association (皇民奉公會 - Kōmin Hōkōkai), has been established and is operating on a grand scale. What is noticeable is that the officers of this association, such as group leaders (班長) and ward chiefs (區長), are primarily appointed from mainland Japanese (內地人). In unavoidable cases, Taiwanese are included, but generally, mainland Japanese are appointed, which differs from Chosŏn.\n\nSanitation facilities are fully equipped, and cleaning, in particular, is thoroughly carried out. For example, public restrooms are kept clean, and sights like those in Kyŏngsŏng are completely absent. Because of this, infectious diseases are also very rare. I was worried about being troubled by malaria, as Taiwan is famous for it, but I was told that today there is absolutely no such risk, and one can feel at ease. Even listening to mainland Japanese who have been there for over twenty years, they praised Taiwan's sanitation facilities, saying they hadn't contracted malaria even once since arriving.\n\nCurrently, the overall birth rate in Taiwan is 36.7 per 1,000 people, and the death rate is 23 per 1,000, showing very good results.\n\nNext, I would like to mention a few customs. When the local people (土人) marry, the groom goes to the bride's house with a wide board placed in front of the palanquin (駕寵). Many 10-yen bills are pasted onto this board, and red ink is applied over them as he carries it. Red color is said to represent auspicious events. The same applies when the bride goes to the groom's side. However, recently, applying red ink to bills has been prohibited, so this cannot be done. Also, in Japan, clothes are put into chests of drawers (簟笥), <74> but there, clothes are hung on bamboo poles and carried. This is to show the clothes to people. However, recently, thanks to the Total Mobilization Movement, this type of custom is gradually disappearing. When someone dies, just like in Chosŏn, hired mourners (代哭者) are used, and many geishas ride on horses in a procession to the burial ground. There, a temporary burial is performed, and after three years, the bones are exhumed, washed clean with water, and permanently buried in a cemetery.\n\nNext is commerce in Taiwan. Wherever you go, the Taiwanese are dominant, and there are far more shops run by islanders (本島人) than by mainland Japanese. Taiwanese have low living expenses, so they can naturally direct their surplus energy towards commerce. Even when selling the same goods, the islanders work harder.\n\nThere, besides the regulated price (協定價格), official price (公定價格), and ceiling price (停止價格) (which are the same in Chosŏn), there is also a selling price (販賣價格). This selling price is lower than the official, regulated, and ceiling prices. And if you go to an islander's shop there, the four prices – official, regulated, ceiling, and selling – are written, but in a mainland Japanese shop, even if the selling price is written, it is the same as the official, regulated, and ceiling prices. From this point too, it can be seen that the islanders are skilled in business and make more profit.\n\nNow, about the Takasago-zoku; these are what are generally called raw savages (生蕃), numbering around 150,000. Ideologically, this group is very good. This tribe is originally Taiwanese and lived in the plains until civilization developed, but they were gradually oppressed by the Chinese and naturally fled to the mountains. Consequently, relations between the two groups are very poor. Their character resembles that of mainland Japanese, and they are said to have great future potential.\n\nWe often heard that the raw savages cut off people's heads. And indeed, this was true in the past, but today this evil custom is completely gone.\n\n◇\n\nNow, what is the state of education for these raw savages? Police officers go to the villages, double as teachers, and educate the tribal children (蕃童). They have always been very skilled hunters. Therefore, they used to sustain their lives through hunting. Recently, due to difficulties in obtaining bullets and gunpowder, they seem to be mainly using bows and spears instead of guns. These tribal people are also made to engage in agriculture and forestry, and their results are said to be relatively good. These raw savages lack the ferocity generally imagined, and in terms of human feelings, they are the same as us. For example, when a police officer is transferred, they part tearfully. Last summer, there was the following touching story. A police officer was called up for military service and had to depart, but unfortunately, due to heavy rains, the bridge was flooded and impassable. However, he had to cross somehow to be on time and was greatly distressed. <75> At that time, two female students offered to carry his luggage on their backs and cross for him. They entered the river, but the current was swift, and eventually, their strength gave out, and they were swept away. The name of one of these girls was Sayon (サヨン), and the Governor-General had a bell made in honor of the two girls. Also, a song about Sayon was composed, recorded, and is being sold. Just as we were walking through the streets at night, there was a large crowd gathered. When we asked why, they said they were listening to a broadcast of the Sayon song record, and we too listened with great interest. Afterwards, I told the Governor-General about this, and he was very pleased.\n\nKoreans have also gone to Taiwan. There was one Korean student enrolled in a middle school in Taihoku. I asked the Chief of Police Affairs how many Koreans were there in total, but due to time constraints, I did not receive an answer. The performance of Koreans there is said to be very good. That is, since the annexation of Taiwan (領臺後), there have been absolutely no criminals among the Chosŏn people.\n\nThere are many other things I would like to talk about concerning Taiwan, but I will stop here and move on to China.\n\nI went from Taihoku to Shanghai. This journey takes three days and two nights by ship, but I was able to use an airplane and set foot on Shanghai soil in just two and a half hours.\n\n◇\n\nIn China, I inspected Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou. First, the public security situation, although it cannot be generalized, seems to be good. However, in the Shanghai area, terrorist acts are still frequently carried out these days. Previously, they didn't occur much in the Japanese garrison areas, but recently they have been happening frequently even there. They are carried out actively in various Chinese cities, but Shanghai seems to be the most dangerous among them. In Nanjing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou, walking around the city during the daytime is generally fine, but one must refrain from walking alone late at night. Therefore, even in Hangzhou, we walked in a group of four. According to the soldier who guided us, \"It's safe if you walk in a group, but if you walk alone, you could be attacked without anyone knowing.\" Even in Hangzhou, enemies are apparently present about one *ri* (approx. 4 km) outside the city, so soldiers never walk alone; they always go out in groups of three or four. They offered to have soldiers escort us if we wanted to go out, but we decided against it as there was no need to walk around guarded by soldiers. In Suzhou too, after seeing Hanshan Temple (寒山寺), we thought about climbing a nearby hill, but we were advised by the military not to go, so we cancelled. We had heard there was a temple there and the scenery was very good, so we wanted to go, but since there was no need to force it, we turned back.\n\nIf you carelessly take a taxi there and go far <76> out, there is the danger that while you are running your errand, the driver might communicate with the enemy. When I told the soldiers that we had cancelled the trip to the hill because of such concerns, they said it was good that we had stopped. In this way, even though it is occupied territory, there are still dangers.\n\nShanghai's population is currently about five million. Due to being a melting pot of various ethnic groups, terrorist incidents occur for various reasons.\n\nThese crimes are far worse in nature compared to crimes in Chosŏn. Of course, the number of incidents is far smaller compared to murder cases in Chosŏn. Nevertheless, people are killed simply for the reason of being Japanese, which is truly terrifying behavior. However, the people living there have become completely numb to it and live nonchalantly. If we had gone there already worried, I think we would have had a nervous breakdown within a week.\n\nNext is the economic situation. The value of the Fǎbì (法幣 - Chinese currency) has dropped significantly. (10 yen in Japanese military scrip (軍票) equals 40 Fǎbì). As the Fǎbì falls, prices rise accordingly, causing great hardship. However, compared to when one Fǎbì was worth one Japanese yen, the exchange rate has quadrupled, but prices have only risen by about 30% compared to before.\n\nConsequently, Japanese merchants are in dire straits, and a considerable number are currently in a state of bankruptcy.\n\nTo take an example, suppose one borrows 10,000 yen from the Bank of Japan to buy goods. (These goods are bought by converting to Fǎbì, and sold for Fǎbì). And prices have risen by about 30%, making the goods worth around 13,000 Fǎbì. Therefore, converting that back to Japanese currency yields only about 3,250 yen. Thus, they don't have the money to repay the Bank of Japan. Even in Shanghai, something that can be bought for 5.20 Fǎbì (about 1.30 Japanese yen) in the foreign concessions across the river must be bought for 4 Japanese yen, equivalent to 16 Fǎbì, in the Japanese concession. Consequently, whether eating meals or buying cigarettes, people tend to do everything over there. A lunch that costs about 16 Fǎbì (4 Japanese yen) here can be eaten over there for 6-7 Fǎbì, i.e., within 2 Japanese yen. (This is enough for two people with leftovers). Because people frequently go to the concessions like this, it is the Japanese who spend the most money there. Goods in Shanghai come in from foreign countries, and there are plenty of cotton products, leather, and woolen goods. Bringing goods into Shanghai from the surrounding areas requires permits for everything, and items without permits are confiscated by soldiers. Consequently, women and the elderly carrying two or three *shō* (approx. 3.6-5.4 liters) of rice cannot openly walk on the main streets, so they take back alleys to bring it home. It was said that the goods there would last for about a year, but compared to ten years ago, the quantity is only about one-tenth <77>.\n\n◇\n\nNext, regarding the current exchange rate situation, if Japan's is 100 yen, the US is 23 and 1/8 dollars. And the relationship between the US and China is such that 100 Fǎbì corresponds to about 5 US dollars. Therefore, comparing and calculating these, 1 Japanese yen should fall to about 4.60 Fǎbì. Military scrip (軍票) is mainly used there, and even if you have Bank of Japan notes or Bank of Chosŏn notes, they are not accepted. These must be exchanged for military scrip. For 100 yen in military scrip, one can get 150 yen in Bank of Chosŏn notes. Consequently, there are many people involved in the money business there.\n\nTo give an example: one sends 100 yen from Japan to Hong Kong and receives 23 and 1/8 US dollars. Then, sending this further to Shanghai yields over 460 Fǎbì. And converting that back to Japanese currency results in about 115 yen, ultimately making a profit of 15 yen. Also, exchanging 100 yen in military scrip for Bank of Chosŏn notes yields 150 yen. Bringing this back to Chosŏn and exchanging it for Japanese notes (since Bank of Chosŏn notes and Bank of Japan notes have the same value) yields 150 yen in Bank of Japan notes. Bringing this back to Shanghai yields about 130 yen in military scrip, ultimately resulting in a profit of 30 yen. Due to such activities, there are people engaged in illicit businesses like secretly exchanging Bank of Japan or Bank of Chosŏn notes for people traveling from Japan.\n\nThere are about 5,000 Koreans living there, of whom 2,000 to 3,000 are engaged in legitimate business. The others are involved in such money-making schemes or illegal activities like opium smuggling (阿片密賣). The authorities are also deeply concerned about this area and are studying countermeasures, but in any case, a change of occupation is necessary. A permit is required to conduct business, but I believe this permit issue can somehow be resolved.\n\nI neglected to mention, but in Shanghai, I visited Admiral Shimada (島田), Commander-in-Chief of the China Area Fleet. There, the adjutant told me that the Commander-in-Chief was currently very busy, so I should keep my greetings brief. I entered the Commander's office intending only to offer greetings and leave immediately, but Admiral Koga (古賀) and Chief of Staff Ōkawachi (大川内), the two of them, showed great interest in Chosŏn affairs, and conversation bloomed about Chosŏn, making it impossible for me to leave. During the conversation, they expressed pleasure that Chosŏn had also implemented the name change policy (創氏).\n\n◇\n\nNext, they asked about volunteer soldiers (志願兵), and we explained in detail, simultaneously mentioning that the general public desires the implementation of a volunteer system for the Navy. That high-ranking naval officers like these show such interest in Chosŏn is truly a cause for joy. With this, I would like to conclude my account of the general observations from my inspection tour of Taiwan and China.\n—End— <78>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis 1942 travelogue by Yi Sŭng'u (using the Japanese name Goson Shō'u), a Korean member of the Japanese colonial Central Advisory Council, details his observations during a trip to Taiwan and Central China (Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou). He discusses Taiwan's climate, prosperous agriculture (rice, sugar), impressive forestry, abundant fruit, and well-developed infrastructure and sanitation under Japanese rule. He contrasts the perceived simple but substantial life of Taiwanese Han Chinese with Chosŏn conditions, comments on the assimilation policies (language, clothing), and portrays the indigenous Takasago-zoku (referred to derogatorily as \"raw savages\") positively as loyal and adaptable. In China, he notes the precarious security situation despite occupation, the severe economic disruption caused by currency devaluation impacting Japanese businesses, black market activities (including by some Koreans), and expresses satisfaction at the interest shown by high-ranking Japanese naval officers in Chosŏn affairs, particularly regarding Korean volunteer soldiers for the navy.\n\nFrom a Korean colonial history perspective, the article is revealing for several reasons. It showcases a high-ranking Korean collaborator's perspective, outwardly aligning with Japanese imperial narratives (praising colonial development in Taiwan, using terms like \"Imperial Army,\" promoting assimilation). Yet, it also subtly compares Chosŏn's situation (e.g., less developed research, desire for naval volunteers) and observes the complex position of Koreans abroad (some succeeding legitimately, others involved in illicit activities in Shanghai). Yi's commentary on Taiwanese frugality versus perceived Korean focus on outward appearances, and his remarks on the assimilation process (language difficulties, clothing changes) provide insights into the pressures and adaptations under colonial rule. The discussion of Taiwanese attitudes towards China and Japan post-Chiang Kai-shek's actions offers a glimpse into the shifting loyalties and complexities within the empire. Historians might find Yi's position, his observations on comparative colonial conditions, the state of Koreans in China, and his interactions with Japanese officials particularly interesting for understanding collaboration, colonial ideology, and the lived experiences within the Japanese empire during wartime.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n中樞院 參議\t추수원 참의\tMember of the Central Advisory

李升雨)\n私は今回臺灣及支那に旅行して參りましたが、此の旅行中視察したことに付き其の二、三を申上げまして御叅考に供したいと存じます。私の出張目的は、臺灣の産業狀況視察及在支朝鮮人生活狀況、産業狀況視察、それに皇軍の慰問を兼ねたものであります。\n皇軍慰問に就ては他の機會に讓りまして其他のことに付き申上げます。\n先つ臺灣へ參りましたが、とちら全然異つてゐることは氣候てあります。臺灣は御承知のことゝ思ひますが、臺灣、亞熱帶、溫帶の三地帶に分れて居ります。私の行つた所は大部分が亞熱帶でありまして、ちようど臺中から臺南までの間に柱が立つてゐましたが、之れは熱帶、亞熱帶の境を示す標識ださうであります。阿黑山にも矢張此の樣な標柱が立つて居りましたがそれは溫帶と亞熱帶の境を示す標柱であります。\n臺灣は前述のやうな所でありまして、隨つて私等の行つた時は、ちようどこちらの八月末頃氣候を思はせた次弟で御座います。勿論私達は夏服を用意して行きましたが、こちらが寒い＜70＞とて夏服は無用であるといつた調子で持參しない時は非常に困ると思ひます。斯る氣候でありますが、綿入服も溫房も何にも何等心配はありません。\n或る國民學校の先生に、こゝで何にか一番困つてゐるかと聞いてみました所、生徒に雪といふことを敎へるのに、其の實物を見ることが出來ない。これに一當困つてゐるといふことを云つて居りました。全く臺灣は常夏の國てあります。此所には種々化學方面の研究機關が作られて居まして、設備の方も徹底し居ります。朝鮮にも斯る方面により多く金をかけて硏究させてもらいたいといふのは、あながち私一人の希望ではないと存します。\nさて此の地方では農産業殷賑を極めて居りまして、米作、砂糖作が多いのであります。\n米はこゝては二度作るのでありますが、第二回目第一期作の七、八割位のものがとれます。此の二回作ることをあちらではタホンチと云ふてゐます。これは三月に植え付けて六月に刈り、六月に植え付けて十一月に刈りとるのてあります。\n◇\n頂度私達の行つた時は稻がみのり刈りとつてゐました。臺灣の中で臺南、高雄方面は植付けも一定してゐなけれは刈取りも一定してゐません。則ち其狀况をみますれば、植付けて一ケ月しかたつてゐないものもあれば、又一方には刈り入れてゐるのもありました。\n砂糖作も米作と同じく狀况がいゝやうでありました。砂糖は向ふではカモツチヤと云ふて居りまして、植え付けて一年半はかり經つてから刈りとつてゐます。御參考迄に申しておきますが、米の値段は基隆は一石三十六圓四十二錢五厘でありましたが、朝鮮の米に比較して相當安いのであります。蓬萊米は非常に品が良いそうでありますが、朝鮮のものよりは少し落ちるかも知れません。あちらも米は配給等でありまして、以前は一人前一合八勺迄を配給してゐたそうでありますが、此の頃ては二合三勺までわたつて居ります。\nこれは大半を内地に輸出する爲てありまして、朝鮮と同しく我か國の兵站基地である臺灣の節米振りは非常に見るべきものがあります。\n次に林業に就てゞありますが、萬山巨木が鬱蒼と茂つてゐまして、朝鮮の山を見て向ふの山を見ると一驚せざるを得ません。此の林業の方は殆んど營林署でやつてゐますが、阿黑山の頂上迄鐵道を敷いて大仕掛けにやつて居ります。車中より外を眺めますと、山の中腹には何十萬坪といふ竹林がありました。これは朝鮮の竹と比べまして非常に大きなものでありまして、現在ては日本食品の需要を充たしてゐるこのことでありました。\n臺灣の樹木の中で一當利用範圍の多い木は檜でありまして、臺灣は斯かる樹木に非常に惠まれて居ります。それは、何處の家をみまして、非常に良い＜71＞木の香が鼻をつきます。\n果物は、こゝでは名前を知らない珍らしいものが多く目につきました。先つベーユウといふものがありますが、これは甘くていゝものであります。ブンダン、これも非常に甘く、値段は大體八十錢から一圓位まてであります。其他メロン、パインアツプル、サボヂラ、パパイヤ、ポンカン、バナナ等多種類に亘り、又果物ではありませんが良く似たものにビンロウがみられました。\n私は向ふに行きさへすれは、非常に美味いバナナを思ひつきり食ベられるものと期待してゐたのでありますが全く裡切られ、却つてとちらで賣つてゐるものゝ方が良い位に思はれました。\nそれといふのも品種の上級のものは內地に輸出するが爲であります。此のバナナは一般に栽培してゐるものには肥料を與へますから果實も大きく品も良いのでありますが、山等に自然に育つたものには肥料を與へません故小さいのであります。たがらといつて味も落ちるかと申しますと別にそんなことはありません。免に角果物の豊富なととは美ましい限りであります。\n次に向ふの河川は全くかわき切つて居ります。則ち雨が一度降つても、それは流れて終つて跡は荒廢して廣くなつて居ります。\n此の荒地の整理をする必要があらうと存します。總督閣下にも此の事を話しました所、斯ることに關しては自分も同意であるが、相當の費用がかゝるなすぐやるといぶわけには行かない。徐々施策して行かうといふ話でありました。\n◇\n次は臺灣人に就てゞありまずが其の人種を二つに分けることか出來ます。則ち一つは所謂生蕃でありまして(向ふては高砂族と云つてゐる)現在十五萬人程住居して居ります。そして其の他のものは全部支那より渡來したものであり、根は支那人で御座います。此の方は六百人程住んでゐるそうであります。\n生蕃の方のことは後廻しに對しまして、先づ支那人であるところの臺灣人はどうであるかと申しますと、其の生活もゆつたりしてゐまして、又其の住家も立派なもので御座います。\n臺北の太平町といふ所は支那人の多數集まつてゐる、丁度京城に於ける鐘路の樣な場所でありますが、色々の點からして鍾路よりは遙かに繁華な處てあります。其他各地の支那人の生活も裕福であります。\n兔に角、此の臺灣で非常に良い條件は衣服費が、いらないことて御座います。內地の着物の樣に裕衣、綿入品は全然必要がないのでありまして、此の點經濟方面も大いに助かることでありませう。尙ほ彼等が生活するには石炭薪炭等も全然いらない上、而も生活樣式が支那式でありますから非常に簡單であります。隨つて全く金儲けより外はないので御座います。＜72＞\n私は臺南で、或る人の案內で臺灣人の家に行つてみましたが主に下層階級と中流階級下層階級の生活は朝鮮のそれとあまり相違ありません。乃ち板の間に寢起きしてゐまして簡單そのものてす。\n其處で聞いてみました處、男の方が何處かにつとめて居り、每月四、五十圓位の收入はあるとのことでありました。此の歸りに安內の人より生活樣式の外觀は貧弱にみえても、內容は充實してゐるといふことを聞きました。臺灣全體の樣子を見ましても、臺灣人は內容よりも外觀が貧弱でありました。我々朝鮮人は大いに參考としなけれはならないことであると存します。\n着物の樣式は、以前は總てが支那服でありましたが、然し此の頃では全部之を改めるやうに獎勵されて居ります。丁度朝鮮で白服をやめて色服を獎勵しているやうにつとめてゐるのであります。役所に出入するにも支那服は絕對に許さないとのことで洋服を着けて居ります。然し年寄りまで洋服を着ることは徹底しないと見えて、一部の者は支那服を着けてゐるやう見受けられました。\n◇\nさて敎育の普及狀况はどうてあるかと申しますと、現在初等敎育を受けてゐる者は全體の六割を示してゐますか、昭和十八年度から義務敎育制度が實施されますが、非常に好結果をもたらすものと期待してゐます。而して現在國民學校へ行くことの出來ない者の便宜をはかる爲、皇民塾といふものが作られ、そこに六才から六十才迄の人を收容して敎育して居ります。其の敎育のやり方で面白いと思つたのは、こちらの敎育には修業期間がありますが、此の皇民塾では期間が定められてゐないことであります。乃ち國語を使つて會話が出來るまでは、何年經つてもそとに置いて敎へて居るのであります。此の遣り方は無理に敎へ込むよりも却つて有効ではなからうかと私は思つてゐます。向ふの人の國語の發音は如何しても朝鮮人よりも劣つつて居り支那語の訛りかこれて居りません。\n私達は總督府を訪問しまして殖産局長に御會ひしたのでありますが、其の折局長より、「臺灣でも國語の普及を圖つてゐるが貴方邊の樣に明瞭にうまく國語で話せる人は少い」といふ激讃の言葉を受け恐縮した樣な次第で御座いまして、これよりみましても朝鮮人の發音の明瞭なることがわかります。\n思想の點に就ては、此處の臺灣人の多くは前述の樣にもど〲の臺灣人でなく、支那から渡つて來たものであり、いざといふ場合には本國に歸ることばかり考へて居ります。隨つて以前は支那本國の人を大國人と云ふて居り、支那事變が勃發しても、吾が大國は日本に×つてゐるのであるから、日木全國を××のものとし、此の臺灣も支那の××になるものとし信してゐたのであります。それは、新聞等に日本が連戰連勝してゐることが載つてゐて＜73＞も、誤報であると思ひ込んでゐたのであります。然しあとのなつて通譯の者から日本が實際に勝ち進んでゐることを聞き始めて大國の負けてゐることを知つたのであります。\nさきに廣東省、福建省に居る臺灣人は、事變の起る前に臺灣に引き揚げるやう領事舘から命令したのでありましたが、彼等自分等元來支那人であり、尙ほ自分邊の親放達が彼地に多數居るから蔣介石より殺されることは絕對なしと信じて領事舘の命令に從はなかつたそうてあります。然るに蔣介石はそう思はないて臺灣人は日本人なれば之れは奸漢なりと云ひ、それか爲め殺された者か多かつたそうてありますが、臺灣人で日本の爲偵探をやつたりして實際そうゆふ仕事をやつた者もあるそうてあります。\n然し蔣介石のためにひとい目に會ひ、始めて日本の正らきことを知り、今後は日本に、信賴して行かうといふ考をいだくやうになり、今時では立派な國民になるべく努力してゐるやうであります。でありまして思想方面については現今は何等の懸命がないとのことであります。\n◇\n次に國民總力運動といふやうなことには大いに力を入れてゐまして、今年の六月から朝鮮の國民總力聯盟の如き皇民奉公會といふものを作つて大々的に、やつて居りますが、目たつてゐるのは、此の奉公會の役員である班長、區長には主に內地人を任命してゐることであります。己むを得ない場合は臺灣人を入れてゐますが、大抵內地人を任命して居りまして、此の點が朝鮮と異つてゐます。\n衛生施設は完備されて居り、掃除なと特別によく行き届いて居ります。一例を擧けまするに、共同便所等は淸潔に掃除されて居り、京城のそれのやうなものは全然御座居ません。斯る故、傳染病も非常に少く、私も臺灣はマラリヤで有名であるから惱まされはしないかと心配してゐたのでありますか。今日は全然其のおそれがなく安心しておれるそうであります。向ふに行つて二十年餘りになる內地人の話を聞いてみましても、渡臺以來一回も、マラリヤに罹つたことはないと、臺灣の衛生施設を賞め讚くてゐました。\n目下臺灣全體の生産率は一千人に對し三六·七人で、死亡率は二三人になつて居りまして非常に好成績を示して居ります。\n次に風習の方を二、三申し上けてみたいと存します。向ふの土人の結婚する時には、新郞が新婦の家に徃ぐとき駕寵の前に廣い板を立てて其板に十圓の札を澤山張り付け其の上に赤いいんきを染めて持つて徃くのてあります。赤色は慶事を表はすものだそうであります。新婦が新郞方に徃くときも同樣たそうてあります。然し最近は札に赤いいんきを染めるのを禁止しました爲それが出來ないと云ふのであります。又日本ては簟笥等に着物を入れて行き＜74＞ますが、向ふては竹の棹に着物をぶら下げて持つて行きます。之れは着物を人に見せる爲めであります。然し最近に至りては總力運動の御蔭て此種の慣習が漸次無くなつて徃くそうてあります。又人の死んだ時には、朝鮮と同しく代哭者を立て、馬に藝者を多數のせて列を作つて葬地に行きます。そこで、は、假埋葬をやり、三年經過しますと骨を掘り出して綺麗に水で洗ひ、墓地に本埋葬致します。\n次は臺灣に於ける商業でありますが、何處に行つても臺灣人の方が優勢であり、店も本島人の方か内地人より遙かに多いのであります。臺灣人は生活費があまりかゝりません自然餘力を商業の方に向けることが出來るのであります。同し品物を賣るにしても本島人の方が勉强してゐます。\n向ふては協定價格、公定價格、停止價格、(これは朝鮮等も同じであります)の外に販賣價格かあります。此の販賣價格と申しますのは公定、協定、停止よりも安いのであります。而して向ふの本島人の店に行きますと、公停、協、販の四の値段が書いてありますが、内地人の店には販賣價格は書いてあつても公、協、停の價格と同し樣てあります。斯る點よりみましても、本島人は商賣上手で儲けも多くあります。\nさて高砂族でありますが、これ即ち一般に云ふてゐる生蕃でありまして十五萬人ばかり居ます。此の民族の思想方面は非常に良いのであります。此の種族はもど〱臺灣人でありまして、文化の開けるまては平地の方に住んでゐたのでありますが、段々と支那人に壓迫され、自然山の方へ逃けて行つたのであります。從つて兩族の間は非常に仲が惡いのであります。性格は內地人に似て居り、非常に將來性があるとのことでありました。\n私達はよく生蕃は人の首をきるといふことを聞いてゐました。又事實も昔はそうであつたのでありますが、今日は全然其の惡習は御座いません。\n◇\nさて此の生蕃の敎育狀况はどうてあるかと申しますに、巡査が部落に行つて敎師を兼ね蕃童を敎育致してゐます。彼等は以前より邋が非常に上手てあります。從て獵を以て生活を維持して居つたのであります。此頃に至つては彈丸、火藥類の入手難によりまして鐵砲を使はす、主に弓と槍とでやつてゐるやうです。此の蕃人には農業、林業もやらせて居り、成績も比較的良いそうでした。此の生蕃は一般が考へてゐますやうな獰猛さはなく、人情等に就ても我等と同じであります。乃ち一例をとりますと、巡査が轉勤するとお互に淚をのんでわかれるといふ狀態であります。今年の夏も次のやうな美談がありました。巡査が應召されて出發しなければならないのであるが生憎大水で橋があるが渡れない。然し乍ら何にしても渡つて時間に間に合はなければならず。非常に困惑してゐたのであ＜75＞ります。其の時、女學生二人が荷物を背負つて渡してあけようと進んで川に入つたのですが、流れが速く遂に力盡きて流されて終つたのであります。此の女の名前はサヨンといふのてありまして、總督は彼女達二人のために釣鍾を作つてやりました。又サヨンの歌が作られ、レコードに吹込まれて賣つて居ります。私達が丁度夜の街を歩いてゐると澤山の人だかりがして居ろました。其のわけをたづねてみますと、サヨンの歌のレコード放送を聞いてゐると云ふて居まして、私達も非常に關心をもつて聞きました。終つて其の事を總督に話したが、大變熹んで居られました。\n臺灣にも朝鮮人が行つて居ります。臺北の中學校に朝鮮人の學生が一人入學してゐました。大體朝鮮人は何人位來てゐるかと警務局長にたづねしてみたのでしだが、時間の關係で回答を得なかつた次弟であります。向ふての朝鮮人の成績は非常に良いそうであります。即ち領臺後朝縣人の犯罪者は全然無いそうであります。\n臺灣のことに就ては其他にも話したいことは澤山ありますが、此の邊で止め支那の方にうつりたいと存します。\n臺北から上海に行きましたが、此の間は、船て三日二夜を過さなければなりませんが、飛行機を利用することが出來、僅々二時間半で上海の土をふんだのであります。\n◇\n支那ては上海、南京、蘇州、杭州を視察しましたが、先づ向ふの治安狀况は一槪には云へませんが、よろしいようであります。然し上海方面ては此の頃でもテロ行爲が盛んに行はれてゐます。以前には日本の警備區域ては餘り御座いませんでしたが、此の頃ては日本の警備區域ても頻々として起つて居ります。支那各都市でもさかんに行はれてゐますが、中ても一番上海が危いやうであります。南京、蘇州、杭州でも街の中を晝間步くのは先づいゝのですが、夜中に一人で步くことは差控へなけれはなりません。それでありますから杭州でも四人で歩きましたが、我等を案内した兵隊樣の話によると一團て歩けは安心でずが一人で步いて居ればやられても分らないのでありますと云ひました。杭州ても一里位外に出ると敵が居名そうでありまして、兵隊も一人では決して歩かず。必ず三、四人一緒に出かけてゐます。向ふで外へ出てみるならは兵隊に護らせようとのことでありましたが、別に兵隊に護られて步くまでもないので止めました。蘇州ても寒山寺を見まして序でに丘に登つてみようと思つたのでありますが、軍隊の方から行かない方が良いといふ注意を受け中止しました。そこには御寺もあり、非常に景色か良いといふ事を聞いてゐましたので行つてみたかつたのでありますが、無理をして行くまてもないので引き返した次第であります。\n向ふのタクシーにうつかり乘つて遠＜76＞くに出かけますと用を出してゐる間に其の運轉手が敵に意を通するといふ危險があります。斯かることより後丘行きを中止した旨を兵隊さんに話した所、止めてよかつたと云つて居られましたこういふ工合で占領地域といつても未だ未だ危險があります。\n上海の人口は現在大體五百萬でありまして種々の民族の集團地である關係上、色々の事情よりテロ事件か起るのであります。\n此の犯罪は朝鮮に於ける犯罪に比べ遙かに質の惡いものであります。勿論其の件數に朝鮮の殺人事件に比へて遙かに少ないのであり±す。けれとも兔に角日本人であるといふ理由て殺して了ふのでありまして、全く恐るべき行爲て御座います。然し向ふに行つてゐる人は全く神經痲痹になつて終つて居りまして平氣で暮して居ります。私達は行く前から非常に心配して居れは向ふに一週間も滞在しない中に神經衰弱になつて了ふたらうと存します。\n次に經濟方面でありますが法幣の價値が非常に下つてゐます。(日本の軍票十圓が法幣の四十圓にあたる)。法幣が下かるとそれに從つて物價は上り、非常に困つてゐるやうてあります。然し向ふの一圓が日本の一圓の値打があつたときより比へて爲替相場は四倍となつてありますけれとも、物價は以前の三割しか上つて居りません。\n依つて日本の商人達は非常に困窮し目下破産狀態であるものが相當あります。\n一例をとつてみますれば、一萬圓の金を日本銀行より借りて品物を買うたとします。(此の品物は法幣にかへて買ふのでありまして、賣る時も法幣であります)而して物價は三割位上つて一萬三千圓位であります。そル故それを日本の金にかへると三千二百五十圓位にしかならず。依つて日本銀行に返す金かないのであります。上海でも川向ふの外國租界に行けは法幣五圓二十錢(日本金一圓三十錢)位で買へるものも、日本租界ては日本金四圓即ち法幣十六圓で質はねばならぬ勘定となるのてあります。從つて食事をするにも煙草を買ふにしても全部向ふで用をすます樣になります。晝飯を食ふにしてもこちらで法幣十六圓(日本金四圓)位の。ものを向ふては法幣六七圓即ち日本金二圓以內で食ベられます。(これは二人で食べても餘ります)こういふ風にちよつとすると租界へ行きますから、金を一番多く落すのは日本人であります。上海の物資は外國から入つて來て居りまして、綿製品、皮、毛織物品隨分澤山あります。上海の物資は其の地方より持つて來るには全部許可制になつて居り、許可のないものは兵隊がとりおさへてゐます。随つて女、老人が米を二升、三升持つて大つびらに表を通ることか出來ませんから裡を通つて自分の家に持ち歸つてゐる樣な次第であります。あちらの品物は一年位は大丈夫であると云つてゐましたが、十年も前に比較すれば僅か一割位にしかな＜77＞らないとのことでありました。\n◇\n次に爲替相場の現狀は、今日本のそれは百圓でありますと、米國は二十三ドル八分の一であります。而して米國と支那この關係は法幣の百圓が米國の五ドル位に相當します。てありますから彼是比較して計算しますれは日本金一圓が法幣で四圓六十錢位迄下落しなけれはなりません。向ふては主に軍票を使つて居り、日本銀行券とか、朝鮮銀行券を持つてゐても通用しません。これは軍票に兩替しなけれはならないのてあります。朝鮮銀行券は軍票百圓に對し百五十圓はもらふことが出來ます隨つて向ふで金の商賣をやつてゐる人が多いのであります。\n例を擧げてみますと日本から金百圓を香港て送つて米ドル二十三ドル八分の一を貰ひます。而して之を更に上海に送ると法幣四百六十圓餘になります。そしてそれを日本の金にかへると百十五圓位になり結局十五圓儲かることになります。又軍票百圓を朝鮮銀行券に換へれは百五十圓を貰へるのてあります。之を朝鮮に持ち歸つて日本券に換へて朝鮮銀行券と日本銀行券とは同額ですから日本銀行券百五十圓を貰ひます。之を上海に持ち歸ると軍票百三十圓位になりますから結局三十圓儲かることになるのであります。斯かることに依り、日本から向ふへ行く人に對し、持つてゐる日本銀行券、朝鮮銀行券を裡の中で兩替してやるといふやうな不正業をやつて居る人があります\n向に行つて居る朝鮮人は五千人程居りますか、其の中で相當の商賣をしてゐる者は二三千人でありまして、其の他は斯かる金儲けや、阿片密賣といふやうな不正業にたづさわつてゐるのであります。當局も此の方面には腐心してゐまして、その善後策を硏究中でありますが、免に角轉業しなけれはなりません。商賣するには許可がいるのでありますが、此の許可問題は何とか出來ると存じます。\n云ひ洩らしましたか、上海で支那方面艦隊司令長官島田閣下を訪問しました。そこて副官より司令官閣下は今御多忙中であるから簡單に挨拶してくれとのことを云はれ、挨拶丈して直ぐ辭する都合で司令官室に入りました處へ古賀長官、大川内總叅謀長の二人が朝鮮のことに非常に關心を持たれ、朝鮮話に花が咲いてどうしても腰を上げることが出來ませんでした。話の中、朝鮮の方でも創氏したことを喜んで居られました。\n◇\n次に志願兵のことに付て聞かれて私達は詳細に說明すると同時に一般民衆は海軍の志願兵の實施を希望してゐることを話しておきました。いやしくも斯く海軍の長官が朝鮮に就て關心を持つてゐられるといふヒとは非常に喜ぶべきことであります。以上臺灣及支那視察の槪要について私の筆を終りたいと存じます。\n―終り―＜78＞\n＜70-78＞","magazine":"삼천리 제14권 제1호","date":"1942년 01월 01일","title":"[Japanese] Travelogue of Taiwan and Central China: Finishing a Month and a Half Journey Through Various Places"},{"path":"89_14.01_1942.01/100.txt","issue":"89_14.01_1942.01","content":"Memories of Tokyo\n\t\t\t\t\t\tKayama Mitsurō (Former Name: Yi Kwangsu)\n\nIt was the summer of Meiji 38 (1905) when I first went to Tokyo. At that time, I was a fourteen-year-old boy. I grew up in Tokyo until Meiji 43 (1910), when I was nineteen.\n\nIt was the time of the great victory in the Russo-Japanese War, but the Tokyo of that time was still a child compared to the Tokyo of today. There were streetcars, but electric lights were not yet widespread, and in our boarding house, we used oil lamps. Naturally, the roads were not paved, and when it rained, they became very muddy, so I also wore high wooden clogs (足駄). There were about eighty Korean students.\n\nIn the Tokyo after the Russo-Japanese War ended, the golden age of Naturalism arrived in the literary world. Reading the book \"The Sorrow of Reality Exposed\" (現實暴露の悲哀) by Mr. Hasegawa Tenkei, I felt I had become a respectable Naturalist myself.\n\nAt the same time, translations of Tolstoy and other Russian literature were flourishing in Tokyo back then. Students greatly admired Europe.\n\nThe second time I went to Tokyo was from Taishō 4 (1915) until Taishō 8 (1919), that is, during the European Great War [WWI]. This period was the heyday of democracy, likely the time when Western-style political thought was most vigorous. It was often said, \"This is democracy, that is democracy (it's getting dark).\" I was studying philosophy at Waseda University, focusing mainly on Kant. We were made to read the logic of Rickert and Lipps, and the aesthetics and logic of Lotze.\n\nThe third time I went to Tokyo was immediately after the Great Kantō Earthquake in Taishō 12 (1923). Two trends were budding in thought and literature: nationalistic (國粹的) reflection and a Marxist (スルクス主義) tendency.\n\nThe fourth time I went was in Shōwa 10 (1935), and since my family stayed in Tokyo for the better part of three years, I also visited in Shōwa 11 (1936). This was when the nationalistic popular literature, which had begun to emerge after the Great Earthquake, captured the soul of the national masses, disregarding the scorn of the pure literature school. Although it was for a short period, I was able to savor Japanese culture and the Japanese spirit with an open and frank mind (虛心坦懷). I greeted the New Year of Shōwa 12 (1937) on the second floor of my temporary residence in Yashiki-chō, Azabu Umeda-chō, gazing at the form of Mount Fuji. Within the Japanese New Year custom of purifying oneself in the bath, visiting shrines (神に詣り), and going to temples (お寺にまゐる), I suddenly saw the Japanese spirit.\n\nWhen I go to ■■ next time, it will be ■■■■ as the great capital (大都) of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. It will surely be a Tokyo many times larger, more beautiful, ■■, more powerful, and more radiant than the Tokyo of Meiji 38. <79>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe author, Yi Kwangsu (writing under his Japanese name Kayama Mitsurō), recounts his four visits to Tokyo between 1905 and the late 1930s. He describes the city's atmosphere and intellectual trends during each period: the post-Russo-Japanese War era marked by literary Naturalism and fascination with Russian literature; the Taishō democracy period during WWI focused on Western philosophy; the post-earthquake years with rising nationalism and Marxism; and the mid-1930s characterized by the triumph of popular, nationalistic literature. He contrasts the earlier, less developed Tokyo with its anticipated future grandeur as the capital of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, expressing a personal connection to the \"Japanese spirit\" he observed during a New Year's stay. For historians, the article is revealing as it documents the evolving perspective of a prominent Korean intellectual under Japanese rule, showing his assimilation (adopting a Japanese name), his embrace of Japanese culture and \"spirit,\" and ultimately his endorsement of Japan's imperial project in 1942, offering insight into the complexities of collaboration during the colonial period.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n香山光郞\tかやまみつろう\tKayama Mitsurō\n李光洙\t이광수\tYi Kwangsu\n東京\tとうきょう\tTōkyō\n朝鮮\tちょうせん\tChōsen\n長谷川天溪\tはせがわてんけい\tHasegawa Tenkei\nトルストイ\tとるすとい\tTolstoy\nロシヤ\tろしあ\tRussia\nヨーロツパ\tよーろっぱ\tEurope\n早稻田大學\tわせだだいがく\tWaseda University\nカント\tかんと\tKant\nリツケルト\tりっけると\tRickert\nリツプス\tりっぷす\tLipps\nロツエ\tろつえ\tLotze\n歐米\tおうべい\tEurope and America\n麻布梅田町\tあざぶうめだちょう\tAzabu Umeda-chō\n富士\tふじ\tFuji\n全東亞共榮圈\tぜんとうあきょうえいけん\tGreater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\n\n**Glossary**\n\n思ひ出\tおもいで\tMemory, recollection (older spelling of 思い出)\n當時\tとうじ\tAt that time\n下宿\tげしゅく\tLodging house, boarding house\n電燈\tでんとう\tElectric light\n舖裝\tほそう\tPaving (older kanji for 舗装)\n濘む\tぬかるむ\tTo be muddy\n足駄\tあしだ\tHigh wooden clogs (geta)\n日露戰爭\tにちろせんそう\tRusso-Japanese War\n文舉上\tぶんがくじょう\tIn the literary world (Likely 文學上)\n自然主義\tしぜんしゅぎ\tNaturalism (literary movement)\n全盛期\tぜんせいき\tGolden age, peak period\n現實暴露の悲哀\tげんじつばくろのひあい\tThe Sorrow of Reality Exposed (book title)\n一廉\tいっかど\tRespectable, full-fledged (usually 一角)\nゐる\tいる\tTo be, to exist (older kana for いる)\n飜譯\tほんやく\tTranslation (older kanji for 翻訳)\n崇拝\tすうはい\tWorship, adoration\nデモクラシー\tでもくらしー\tDemocracy\n哲學\tてつがく\tPhilosophy (older kanji for 哲学)\n國粹的\tこくすいてき\tNationalistic, ultranationalistic (older kanji for 国粋的)\nスルクス主義\tまるくすしゅぎ\tMarxism (likely phonetic representation of マルクス主義)\n萠える\tもえる\tTo sprout, bud (older kanji for 萌える)\n虛心坦懷\tきょしんたんかい\tWith an open and frank mind\n寓居\tぐうきょ\tTemporary residence, lodging\n淨める\tきよめる\tTo purify, cleanse\n詣る\tまいる\tTo visit (a shrine or temple)\n共榮圈\tきょうえいけん\tCo-Prosperity Sphere\n大都\tたいと\tGreat capital, metropolis\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n잡지명\t삼천리 제14권 제1호\n발행일\t1942년 01월 01일\n기사제목\t東京の思ひ出\n필자\t香山光郞(舊名 李光洙)\n기사형태\t회고·수기\n\n東京の思ひ出\n\t\t\t\t\t\t香山光郞(舊名 李光洙)\n私が最初東京へ出たのは明治三十八年の夏でした。當時私は十四歳の少年でした。明治四十三年、十九歲の時まで東京で大きくなつたのでした。\n日露戰爭に大勝利を得た時でありましたが、東京は今日の東京に比べるとまだ子供でした。電車はありましたが電燈はまだ普及して居らず、私たちの下宿では石油ランプを使つて居りました。母論道路に舖裝などしてなく雨が降ることても濘んで私も足駄を履きました。朝鮮の學生は八十るばかり居りました。\n日露戰爭が濟んでからの東京には、文舉上では自然主義の全盛期が來ました。「現實暴露の悲哀」といふ長谷川天溪氏の著書を讀んで私も一廉の自然主義者になつた氣でゐたのでした。\n同時に當時東京ではトルストイやその他のロシヤ文學の飜譯が盛んでありました。學生たちは大變ヨーロツパを崇拝して居りました。\n二度目に東京へ私が行つたのは大正四年で大正八年まで即ち歐洲大戰中にゐたのですか、この期間はデモクラシー全盛時代で、歐米式政治思想のもつとも盛んな時だつたでせう。「これデモクラシ、あれデモクラシ(暮)」などいはれたものでした。私は早稻田大學で哲學を勉强してゐましたがカントが主でありました。リツケルト、リツプスの論理學やロツエの美學、論理學など讀まされました。\n第三回目に私が東京へ行つたのは大正十二年の震災直後で、思想や文學は國粹的な反省とスルクス主義傾向との二つが萠えて居りた。\n第四回目に行つたのは昭和十年で、家族が足掛三年も東京に行つてゐたので十一年にもまいりました。大震災後起りかけた國粹的な大衆文學が、純文學派の嘲笑を尻目に國民大衆の魂を獲得した時でした。私は短期間ではあるが、虛心坦懷に日本文化、日本精神を味はふことが出來ましたの。私は昭和十二年のお正月を麻布梅田町の屋敷町の寓居の二階で、富士の姿を眺めながら迎へたのでした。■の風呂で身を淨めて神に詣りお寺にまゐるといふ日本的なお正月の中に私はふと日本精神を見たのでした。\n今度■■へ行つたら、全東亞共榮圈の大都たる■■■■ることゝなるのですそれが明治三十八年の東京よりは幾層倍も大きく美しく■■あり力あり輝きのある東京でせう。＜79＞\n＜79＞","magazine":"삼천리 제14권 제1호","date":"1942년 01월 01일","title":"[Japanese] Memories of Tokyo (Tōkyō no Omoide)"},{"path":"89_14.01_1942.01/110.txt","issue":"89_14.01_1942.01","content":"**Body Text Translation:**\n\nMemories of Siberia\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMaeil Sinbo Managing Director, Kim Pŏn-dong-jin (Kanemoto Tōshin) (Former name: Kim Tong-jin)\n\nI spent most of my youth in Siberia. Although when I say Siberia, it was mainly regions like the Maritime Province (沿海州), because I spent my most impressionable years there, memories of my time in Siberia still occasionally surface in my dreams, which troubles me.\n\nThe reason I came to wander around Siberia was that my uncle lived in Vladivostok (浦潮). My paternal uncle moved to Russia about fifty years ago, became naturalized there, and even became the village \"Lǎoyé\" (老爺 - respected elder), so everyone respectfully called him \"Kim Lǎoyé-sama\" (金老爺樣). This Lǎoyé uncle seemed to have made a considerable amount of money, and around 1917 (Taishō 6), I believe, he held deposits worth over one hundred thousand rubles in the Matsuda Banking Department (松田銀行部), the predecessor to the Bank of Chosŏn's Vladivostok branch. His reason for depositing Russian money in a Japanese bank was likely that he thought Japanese banks were more reliable, but Russian money was more valuable. Indeed, at that time, one ruble was worth slightly more than one yen, so his psychology was probably understandable. Although young, I had heard and seen a little, and advised him to quickly exchange it for Japanese currency. However, he seemed to think, \"What's this cheeky brat saying?\" and stubbornly refused to budge. But not long after, the ruble plummeted, again and again. Finally, he withdrew his deposits and came back carrying a full sack on his back, but it wasn't even enough to buy a single boat. If he hadn't been running a shipping business at that time, he probably would have gone mad from grief.\n\nActually, I was supposed to be adopted into the house of my uncle, the head of the main family (宗家), but while he was grieving over this, his young second wife gave birth to a boy, so the adoption plans were cancelled. If the ruble hadn't crashed, if my aunt hadn't had a child, and if I had been adopted into the Lǎoyé's house, my fate would certainly not have been what it has been. In any case, I ended up settling in Vladivostok because of this, but what made me keenly feel that Russia was a frightening country was the prevalence of theft and murder. On the second day after I arrived in Vladivostok, a Russian man in military attire was found collapsed inside the wooden fence of the children's park by the main river, his throat slit. Then, the very next day, a Chinese coolie was found dead with his <80> head split open at the Egersheld (エゲルセルト) pier. Rumors at the time were terrifying: thieves would fish up people walking on the pavement from the second floor in the middle of the night, kill them, and take their money; or robbers wearing gloves like Syameponchin(?) with needles embedded in the palms would strike people's faces, half-killing them. It was all just hair-raising talk, and I was too timid to go out much. I also heard that even among fellow Koreans, saying things like \"He's a spy\" or \"He belongs to that faction,\" they would take guys they didn't like, put them alive into hemp sacks in the middle of the night, and throw them into the depths of Amur Bay (アムール灣). Hearing this, I secretly lamented, \"Oh my, what a terrible place I've come to.\"\n\nHowever, after only a short while, I got used to that life, and seeing one or two people dead no longer made me feel anything. Whether I became bolder or more cunning, I became, in any case, more \"continental,\" and my life in Russia became increasingly interesting.\n\nAt that time, somewhere between 140,000-150,000 or perhaps as many as 200,000 Koreans lived in Siberia. They formed considerable villages mainly in the southern Ussuri (ウスリ) region, but also north from Khabarovsk (ハバロフスク) to Nikolaevsk (ニコラエスク), along the Amur Railway (アムール鐵道) line, and even on the north bank of the Amur River (黑龍江). Their livelihoods mostly consisted of opium cultivation, paddy farming (considerable paddy fields had already been reclaimed by then), and other agriculture. Besides that, many worked as migrant laborers in gold mines, fisheries, etc. Migrant work in fisheries seemed quite profitable; if they worked from early spring to early autumn, they could spend the whole winter idling and gambling. Since gambling came up, one impression that still hasn't faded is that below the Korean village in Vladivostok, there was a Chinatown. This Chinatown flourished catering to the Koreans from the village above, so there were all sorts of businesses. Among them were clandestine brothels and gambling dens, and the money Koreans earned through sweat and toil was almost entirely poured into there. Several of us youths planned to eliminate this den of vice. One day, pistols in hand, we raided [lit. broke into/raided - 乱入し] the place, chased out all the Koreans playing a gamble called \"Yaba-i\" (ヤバ井), dragged out the owner, and beat him half to death. Later, we heard that this guy was actually a bandit leader and would come for revenge, so we hid in Nikolsk for a while. In reality, Russia at that time was in a state of complete lawlessness, and each community had to provide for its own defense. The Korean community association (民會) handled not only minor criminal trials but even civil trials. When I attended middle school in Khabarovsk, I sometimes stayed in a naturalized Korean village called Taban (タバン), about ten *ri* southwest of Khabarovsk. It was right along the Ussuri River, where birch forests grew thickly. I often fished for river salmon here and rode those docile Russian horses out hunting. It was truly a youth reminiscent of Turgenev's *A Sportsman's Sketches*, unforgettable even now. Especially the joy of gliding through the birch forest in a sleigh (橇), wrapped in a *shuba* (fur coat) on a cold winter day, will likely be a memory I never forget for my entire life. Siberia lacks pine trees like those in Korea, but only at Bochkarevo (ポチカレオ), the branch point from the Amur Railway to Blagoveshchensk (ブラゴヱチエンスク), was there a forest of these pines, which delighted us. In this village of Bochkarevo lived the daughter of a retired colonel named Valya (ワーリヤ). <81> She was quite beautiful, so I often visited her house, and we frequently walked arm in arm through that pine forest. Northwest of Bochkarevo is a town called Alekseyevsk (アレキセフスク). It is the base station leading to the Zeya (ゼーヤ) region, Siberia's largest placer gold mining area, and I believe the Amur Railway Bureau was located there at the time, making it bustling. I often took that Valya out there; this too must be a romance of youth. I heard this story after returning to Korea, but apparently near this Alekseyevsk, factions like the Irkutsk (イルクツスク) group and the Shanghai (上海) group clashed due to Communist Party friction (軌轢), resulting in several thousand deaths. Such is the extremity of partisan conflict.\n\nI once intended to go to Moscow (莫斯科) but got as far as Chita (チタ) before being turned back. Near Chita, at the western end of the Amur Railway, there is a station called Mogocha (モゴチヤ). Rumor has it that this is where Katyusha (カチユーシヤ) from Tolstoy's (トルストイ) *Resurrection* was exiled to Siberia. Whether true or not, I became terribly sentimental.\n\nMy national language (Japanese) is very poor, but this too is because it was learned in Russia, so it's amusing. At the Far Eastern University (極東大學) in Vladivostok, there was a lecturer named Maeda (前田), a priest from the Vladivostok Honganji Temple (浦汐本願寺). This man was very kind to me and often taught me Japanese. I received lectures on the *Man'yōshū* from him as well. Besides him, there was my second cousin (又從兄), a university senior named Kim Roman Nikolaevich (金ロマン、ニコラエウイチ). He was born in Russia but graduated from Keio for middle school, so his Japanese was excellent, and I was greatly influenced by him. This Mr. Kim married the daughter of a Russian general and lived with her for seven or eight years, but later, in Moscow, this wife left him. He remarried a Korean woman and should still be in Moscow or Kuybyshevka (クイピセフカ). I consider him a very talented and great person. His father, that is, my uncle (five removes, in Korean terms - 五寸), became successful in Vladivostok and built a large house there forty years ago. That building later became the central telegraph office. Seeing it on the main street (目拔の通り), I always admired him as a remarkable Korean.\n\nAbout two *ri* north of the Suchan (スーチヤン) coal mine, where coal is abundant, there was a large naturalized Korean village called Shinyŏngdong (新榮洞). There was a middle school there, and when digging in the schoolyard, fragments of roof tiles (瓦當), bricks (磚), and the like came out in abundance. The teacher said they were likely relics from the Balhae (渤海) period. Two years ago, when I saw the Balhae period ruins in Dongjingcheng (東京城), Manchukuo, I was deeply moved by nostalgic feelings (懷古の感).\n\nLieutenant Colonel Yi Ryang (李亮) of Manchukuo is a close friend from my Vladivostok days. At that time, he said he was running an agency for passenger ships belonging to the Tōyō Giyū Kantai (東洋義勇艦隊 - East Asian Volunteer Fleet?) <82> or something like that. Wearing thick Lloyd glasses and holding a large sailor's pipe, despite his youth, he carried himself with composure and treated people like me as mere students (書生). Back then, the only Korean-language newspaper had been shut down [lit. burned - 燒かれ], and there was nothing to read. So, I talked with Mr. Yi Ryang, Mr. Yŏ (呂君) (now deceased), and Mr. Wi (韋君) (now in Shanghai), and we launched a weekly paper called \"Kultur\" (クルツール - Culture) in both Korean and Russian. Of course, there was no way we had Korean script (諺文 - Hangul) movable type. We barely managed to find a Chinese lithographer, hired scribes, and painstakingly published over twenty issues. The expenses were covered by the members pooling funds, and it was truly a desperate struggle. I think it's something we could only have done in those days of youthful ardor (血氣旺ん), but perhaps this experience was the underlying reason I later became this newspaperman.\n\nFormerly (曩者), when relations with Russia were tense, my senior Mr. Watanabe Toyohiko (渡邊豊日子) said to me at a certain restaurant, 'Well, Mr. Kanemoto (金本君), are the preparations ready? I'm going too, so let's go together!' I was overcome with indescribable emotion, my heart full. Around the same time, urgent news came from Mr. Sŏ (徐君) in Harbin (哈爾濱): \"The time is approaching. The Maritime Province awaits us.\" Something with the same meaning also arrived from Mr. Yi Ryang. In the autumn of 1936 (Shōwa 11), when I met His Excellency General Ugaki (宇坦大將 - likely Ugaki Kazushige), His Excellency told me, \"Korea-Manchuria colonization (鮮滿拓殖) will likely have to deal with the Korean compatriots in Russian territory in the future, so join now and study thoroughly.\" And so I joined that company. Perhaps the ties between me and Siberia will not be cut until the day I die. <83>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe author, Kim Pŏn-dong-jin (Kanemoto Tōshin), reminisces about his youth spent in the Russian Far East (primarily Vladivostok and surrounding areas) around the time of the Russian Revolution. He details his uncle's financial ruin due to the ruble's collapse, the pervasive lawlessness and violence (murders, robberies, factional Korean violence), the lives of the large Korean immigrant population involved in farming (including opium), fishing, mining, and their attempts at self-governance. He shares personal anecdotes about his education, a youthful romance with a Russian girl, his struggles with learning Japanese, influential figures he met, and his involvement in starting a bilingual Korean-Russian newspaper. The memoir concludes by linking his past experiences to the contemporary geopolitical situation (1942), expressing anticipation, shared with other pro-Japanese figures, of future Japanese expansion into the Soviet Far East, particularly the Maritime Province, framed within the context of \"Korea-Manchuria colonization.\"\n\nFrom a historical perspective, the article is significant for its firsthand account of the Korean diaspora in the Russian Far East before the 1937 deportations, offering details on their economic activities (notably mentioning opium cultivation), social structures, adaptation to the turbulent post-revolutionary environment, and early cultural initiatives like publishing. It also reveals the pro-Japanese perspective of a prominent Korean collaborator (editor at *Maeil Sinbo*, using a Japanese name), showcasing how figures like him viewed Japanese expansionism, including potential conflict with the USSR, as linked to the fate of Koreans in the region and the broader \"Korea-Manchuria colonization\" project promoted by Imperial Japan. His connections to figures in Manchukuo and the Japanese military further highlight these networks.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n西伯利亞\tシベリア\tSiberia\n沿海州\tエンカイシュウ\tMaritime Province\n露西亞\tロシア\tRussia\n浦潮\tウラジオ\tVladivostok\n金老爺樣\tキムノイエサマ\tKim Noye-sama (Mr. Kim the Elder)\n朝鮮銀行浦汐支店\tチョウセンギンコウ ウラジオシテン\tBank of Chosŏn Vladivostok Branch\n松田銀行部\tマツダギンコウブ\tMatsuda Banking Department\nエゲルセルト\tエゲルセルト\tEgersheld (Pier in Vladivostok)\nアムール灣\tアムールワン\tAmur Bay\nウスリ\tウスリ\tUssuri (Region/River)\nハバロフスク\tハバロフスク\tKhabarovsk\nニコラエスク\tニコラエフスク\tNikolaevsk\nアムール鐵道\tアムールテツドウ\tAmur Railway\n黑龍江\tコクリュウコウ\tAmur River (Heilongjiang)\nタバン\tタバン\tTaban (Village near Khabarovsk)\nニコリスク\tニコリスク\tNikolsk (Nikolsk-Ussuriysky, now Ussuriysk)\nウスリ江\tウスリコウ\tUssuri River\nツルゲネフ\tツルゲーネフ\tTurgenev\nブラゴヱチエンスク\tブラゴヴェシチェンスク\tBlagoveshchensk\nポチカレオ\tボチカレヴォ\tBochkarevo\nワーリヤ\tワーリャ\tValya (Russian name)\nアレキセフスク\tアレキセーエフスク\tAlekseyevsk\nゼーヤ\tゼーヤ\tZeya (Region/River)\nアムール鐵道局\tアムールテツドウキョク\tAmur Railway Bureau\nイルクツスク\tイルクーツク\tIrkutsk\n上海\tシャンハイ\tShanghai\n莫斯科\tモスクワ\tMoscow\nチタ\tチタ\tChita\nモゴチヤ\tモゴーチャ\tMogocha\nトルストイ\tトルストイ\tTolstoy\nカチユーシヤ\tカチューシャ\tKatyusha (Character name)\n極東大學\tキョクトウダイガク\tFar Eastern University (Vladivostok)\n浦汐本願寺\tウラジオホンガンジ\tVladivostok Honganji Temple\n前田\tマエダ\tMaeda (Japanese surname)\n金ロマン、ニコラエウイチ\tキム・ローマン・ニコラーエヴィチ\tKim Roman Nikolaevich\n慶應\tケイオウ\tKeio (University/School)\nクイピセフカ\tクイビシェフカ\tKuybyshevka (Possibly Kuybyshev/Samara or a smaller settlement)\nスーチヤン\tスーチャン\tSuchan (Now Partizansk)\n新榮洞\tシンエイドウ\tShinyŏngdong (Korean village name, McCune-Reischauer: Sin'yŏng-dong)\n渤海\tボッカイ\tBalhae (Ancient Kingdom)\n滿洲國\tマンシュウコク\tManchukuo\n東京城\tトウケイジョウ\tDongjingcheng (Balhae capital site)\n李亮\tリ・リョウ\tYi Ryang (McCune-Reischauer) / Ri Ryō (Japanese reading) (Manchukuo Lt.

金本東進 (舊名 金東進)\n기사형태\t회고·수기\n\n西伯利亞の思ひ出\n\t\t\t\t\t\t每日新報 常務 金本東進 (舊名 金東進)\n僕は靑少年時代を殆ど西伯利亞で暮した。西伯利亞と云つても主として沿海州の等地方だけれど兎角一番感受性の强い時代をあちらで過したものだから未だ時たま夢に西伯利亞時代の思出が浮んでゐるので困つて居る。\n僕が西伯利亞を流浪さる樣になつた動機は伯父が浦潮に住んで居たからである。供の伯父は約五十年前に露西强に引越して向ふに歸化し部落の「老爺」に迄なつたので皆は「金老爺樣」と云つ尊爲して居た。この老爺樣の伯父が相當金を儲けたと見えて大正六年頃だと思ふが朝鮮銀行浦汐支店の前身である松田銀行部に十數萬ルブルの預金を以つて居た。日本の銀行に露西亞の金を預けたのは銀行は日本の方が確實だが金は露西亞の方が貴いとも思つたのであらう。事實當時一ルーブルは一圓より多少高い相場であつたので無理も無い心理であつたらうと思ふ。僕は若年ながら多少の見聞きかせて早く日本貨幣に換えて置く樣勸めて見た。しかし彼は「この小僧何を生意氣に」とも思つたと見えて頑として動かなかつたが幾度もならずしてルーブル貨は暴落又暴落、遂に彼は預金を掛出して袋に一杯背負つて來たけれ共船一隻を買ふ金にも足りなかつた。若しその時彼が船運輸業を營んで居なかつたなら恐らく歎きの餘りに精神病者にでもなつたであらう。\n僕は實は宗家である伯父の家に養子に行く樣になつて居たが彼がこんなことで悲んで居るとき彼の若い後妻は男の子を生んで吳れたので養子の話は取止めとなつたが若しルーブルが暴落もしない。若し伯母が子供も生まないで僕が老爺樣の處に樣子に人つたとされば僕の運命は今迄のそれでは無かつたこと必是である。兎に角こんなことで浦汐に落着くことになつたが、露西亞は恐い國であるをしみ〲と感じたのは泥棒と殺人の多いことである。僕が浦汐に着いて二日目に一番川の子供公園の木柵內で軍人姿の露人が咽喉を抉られて倒れて居るのがあつたが又その翌日エゲルセルト埠頭で支那人苦力が＜80＞頭を割られて死んで居た。當時噂に聞くと夜中二階から泥棒が步道を通る人頸を釣り上げては殺して金を取るんだのとか或は掌に針を生やしたシヤンポンチン見た樣な手袋をはめた强盜が人の顔面を一擊して半殺しにするんだとかそれはそれは肌に票立つ話ばかりで僕は臆劫で碌々外出も出來なかつた。朝鮮人同志でもいやあれはスパイだとかあれは何系だとか云つてお互に氣に喰はない奴は眞夜中生きたま々麻袋に人れてアムール灣の海底に投げ込んだりすることを聞いたのでこれはこれはとんでもないことろに來たもんだなと心祕かに歎いたものである。\nしかしそれもつかの問幾何もならぢしてその生活にたれてしまつて人の一人二人位死んだのを見だとも感じなくなつた。氣が大きくなつたのかずるくなつたのか兎に角大陸的になつて愈々僕の露西亞生活は面白くなつて行つた\n當時西伯利亞には十四五萬或は二十萬に達する朝鮮人が住んで居た。主として南部ウスリ地方はもとより北はハバロフスクからニコラエスク成はアムール鐵道沿線は勿論黑龍江の北岸迄かなりの部落を形成して居た。是等の生業は阿片栽培、水田耕作(その時旣に相當の水田が開懇されて居た)其他の農業が多く其他は金鑛、漁場等への出稼が多かつた漁場へか出稼は相當有利と見えて春先から秋口迄出稼せば一冬中遊んでばくちを打つて居た。ばくちの語が出た序に一つの印象が未だ消へずにあるのは浦汐朝鮮村の下の方に支那人町があつたがこの支那人町は上の方の朝鮮村の朝鮮人を相手に■■上つた町なので色んな商賣が有つたがその內には密淫賣女ら賭博場もあつて朝鮮人が汗水流して稼いた金は殆んど全部そこに貢いて居るので我々靑年數人はこの魔窟退治の計劃を立て或日拳銃を手に手に■入しそこで「ヤバ井」と云ふ賭博を打つて居る朝鮮人全部を追ひ出し主人の奴をひつぱり出し半殺にしたことがあつたが後で開くと實はこ奴が馬賊の頭目で今に復讎に來ると云ふので僕達は暫の間ニコリスクに隱れたことがあつた實際當時露西亞は全く無警察狀態で各住民は自衛兼を購ずねばならぬので朝鮮人は民會の方で小さい刑事裁判は勿論民事裁判迄やつて居た。僕がハバロフスクの中學に通ふときハバロフスクの西南十里位の處のタバンと云ふ歸化朝鮮人部落に居たことがある恰度ウスリ江の沿岸で白樺の森の茂つて居る處で僕はよくここで川鮭を釣りあのおとなしい露西亞馬に跨かり獵に出掛けたものである。全くツルゲネフの獵人日記が思出される靑年時代で今でも忘れることが出來ない。殊に寒い冬の日シユーバに包まれて橇を白樺の林に走らせたあの樂しさは一生忘れられない記憶であらう。西伯利亞には朝鮮の樣な松の木がないがアムール鐵道のブラゴヱチエンスク分岐點ポチカレオだけにはこの松の林があつて僕達を喜ばせたものだ。このポチカレオの村にワーリヤと云ふ退役大佐の娘が居た＜81＞相當美人なのでよくその家に遊びに行つたものだがこれとよく腕を組みその松林の中を散歩したものであるポチカレオの西北の處にアレキセフスクと云ふ町があるこれは西伯利亞最大の砂金鑛ゼーヤ地方に通ずる據點驛であるが確かそのときほアムール鐵道局のあつた處で賑つてゐたと思ふこゝ迄よくあのワーリヤを連れて出掛たものだがこれも若き時代の一つのローマンスであらう。これは歸鮮後聞いた話だがこのアレキセフスク附近でイルクツスク派とか上海派とか共産黨軌轢で戰爭をやり数千人の死亡者を出したさうだ黨同伐異の甚だしきものである。\n僕は莫斯科に往く積りでチタ迄行き引き返されたことがあるがアムール鐵道の西端、チタ附近にモゴチヤと云ふ驛がある巷說にトルストイの復活に出るカチユーシヤが西伯利亞に流された處ださうで眞否は兎角無暗みに感傷的になつたりした。\n僕の國語は非常にまずいものであるがこれも露西亞仕込であるからふるつて居る。浦汐の極東大學に浦汐本願寺の坊さんで前田と云ふ人が講師で居たがこの人がとても僕む親切にして吳れてよく日本語を敎へて吳れたものである。萬葉集もこの人から講釋を受けた。この外に僕の又從兄で大學の先輩金ロマン、ニコラエウイチと云ふ人が居たがこの人は露西亞生れて中學は慶應を出たので非常に日本語に巧みなんで僕はずいぶんこの人の感化を受けたこの金さんは露西亞の將軍の娘と結婚して七八年同棲して居たが其の後莫斯科でこの婦人に逃げら朝鮮婦人と再婚未だ莫斯科かクイピセフカに居る筈である非常に秀才で偉い人と思つて居るこの人の父、即ち僕の伯父(朝鮮式にいへば五寸)は浦汐で出世して今から四十年前その當時浦汐で大きな家を建てた人でその後その建物は中央電信局になつて居るが、それが目拔の通りで見る度に朝鮮人で偉いもんだなと感歎した。\n石炭よく出るスーチヤン炭坑から北二里位の處に朝鮮人歸化村で新榮洞と云ふ大きな部落があつた。こゝに中學があつてその校庭を堀と瓦當の破片やら、磚やらがざく〱出て來た。先生の話には渤海時代の遺物らしいとのことであつたが一昨年僕が滿洲國東京城の渤海時代の古蹟を見て壤古の感一入深きものがあつた。\n今滿洲國中佐である李亮君とは浦汐時代の親友である。先生はそのとき東洋義勇艦隊所屬、旅客船の代理店をや＜82＞るんだとかで太いロイド眼鏡を掛け大きいマトロスパイプを啣へ若輩ながら悠然と構へ僕の如きものをば書生扱にしたものである。そのとき唯一の朝鮮語新聞が燒かれ何一つとて讀物が無かつた當時なので僕は李亮君と今は故人となつた呂君と今上海に居る韋君と語り合い鮮露兩文で文化「クルツール」と云ふ週刊紙を出した。勿論諺文活字がある筈がない。辛じて支那人の石版屋を見付けて寫字生を雇入れこつ〱と根氣よく二十數號も出したが費用なんかも同人達の出し合で全く苦心慘憺でたのであるが血氣旺んなあの時分でなければ到庇出來るものぢやないと思ふがこんなことが後日僕をこの新聞人たらしめた素因であつたかも知れない。\n曩者露西亞關係が險惡なりし時分先輩渡邊豊日子氏が或る料亭で僕に對し『どうぢや金本君準備は出來て居るかね僕も往くから一緖に往かうぢやないか』といはれて何んとも云へぬ感激し胸が一杯になつた。これと時を同じうして哈爾濱の徐君から飛報が來た「時至らんとす沿海州は我等を待つ」と李亮君からも同じ意味のものが着いた。昭和十一年秋僕が宇坦大將閣下に逢いたとき閣下は「鮮滿拓殖は將來露領の朝鮮同胞も相手にせねばならなくなるだらうから今から入つてみつちり勉强したまえ」と謂はれてその會社に入つたのである。恐らく僕と西伯利亞は死ぬるとき迄緣は切れないかも知れない＜83＞\n＜80-83＞","magazine":"삼천리

in Nanjing\nBy Kinoshita Shisetsu\n\nOur Peninsular people (半島人) who reside in this area, spurred by the recent Incident, have reached a number of 500. Although this number is far smaller than in large cities like Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, it is gratifying that all are working diligently. Looking back, Korea and Nanjing have not had much connection since ancient times. About 270 years ago, during the early Qing dynasty, when the Ming dynasty could barely hold on here in Nanjing under Qing pressure, Korea consistently disliked the Qing, sympathized with the Ming, maintained relations, and envoys traveled as far as Nanjing.\nSome people, seeing that the number of Peninsular people in Nanjing is far smaller than in other cities, say that Nanjing lacks future potential for Peninsular people's development, but we oppose this view. We believe Nanjing is the most promising place for Peninsular people. Establishing a foothold in a certain place cannot be done in a short period of one or two years; it requires long years of labor and hardship, possibly more than ten years in the future. Places like Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, and Jinan are where the foundations for Peninsular people were firmly established twenty or thirty years ago, and considerable sacrifices were made. Compared to that, one must remember that the Peninsular people in Nanjing before and after the Incident are not of the same kind; they have come together in a completely mixed manner. From now on, we must work even harder; we must proactively build a foundation. Perhaps in ten years, tens of thousands of Peninsular compatriots will have established a considerable foothold. Why is Nanjing the most promising place for the future? Elsewhere, the ground has already been occupied by long-term residents, making it easy for those with a foothold to work but extremely difficult for newcomers to establish themselves. However, in Nanjing, most residents are newcomers, and there are not too many yet, so if one works actively, now is precisely the time. There is space, and there is plenty of work waiting for enterprising people. It is a golden opportunity that comes once in a thousand years. I want to encourage Peninsular compatriot entrepreneurs to inspect Nanjing. Seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times; if you look closely, there are countless promising businesses. <84>\n\nThe State of Koreans in Beijing\nBy Aoyama Bunsaku\n\n(Beijing) Two and a half years have passed since I came to North China. However, having lived here and there, moving from place to place, rather than residing solely in Beijing, can I, with my shallow perspective, sufficiently convey the news of our Peninsular compatriots in North China through such a valuable publication? Yet, due to the editor's initial request and various circumstances making refusal difficult, I reluctantly take up my pen, despite this being an excessive burden for me. Listing the general circumstances of our compatriots in North China today is quite difficult. Therefore, I will focus on the circumstances common to Peninsular compatriots in Beijing. So, what is the state of commerce and industry in North China? This also lacks vitality and shows weakness, so the lives of us Peninsular people in North China can be described as extremely simple. First, let me describe the history of our compatriots residing in Beijing.\nIt is thought that Peninsular compatriots began residing in North China about thirty-three or thirty-four years ago, before the Republic of China. At that time, it is said there were only about ten people, primarily political dissidents or peddlers from abroad. Among these merchants were peddlers who brought Korean ginseng from Korea, sold it, bought up Chinese antiques, and took them back to the Peninsula. What should be particularly noted here is a town called Paozi Hutong (泡子胡同) within Suzhou Hutong (蘇州胡同) in the East City of Beijing. It is said that this is where a certain Yun Yŏng-bo (尹永保) employed Peninsular prostitutes and Chinese girls (中國姑娘) and opened a restaurant, marking the beginning of Peninsular people's business operations in Beijing.\nSince then, the number of resident compatriots gradually increased, and around the first year of the Republic (1912), there were over ten Peninsular students studying abroad and some merchants. However, the majority were political dissidents from abroad, and the total number is said to have reached seventy-eight. For the following twenty years, the number of residents did not change significantly, but after the Manchurian Incident in Showa 8 (1933) and spurred by the current China Incident, a large number of compatriots flooded in. According to a survey by the Residents' Association (民會) on June 1st last year, their number far exceeded twenty thousand, showing astonishing figures (over 6,680 households). However, what is deeply concerning is that they lack stable occupations. Glancing at the commerce and industry sector, the main entities in Beijing are trading companies such as the solely existing tent manufacturing factory, Asahi Tent Limited Partnership Company (朝日テント合資會社), and the XX Mining Company (××鑛業會社) (unclear). In the cultural field, there are the Kaemyŏng Theater (開明戱院) managed by Mr. Song Paek-hŏn (宋百憲) and the Hwabuk Theater (華北戱院) operated by Mr. Ch'oe Pong-sŏ (崔鳳瑞), among others. Additionally, there seem to be quite a few active in some commercial areas. However, seventy to eighty percent of them are likely engaged in illicit businesses? This truly requires self-reflection from us, the Peninsular populace, without need for further words. Investing hundreds of thousands in opium (阿片) trading and earning tens of thousands of yen in profit daily may be profitable, but it must be decisively abandoned. Even if one starves to death, at this juncture, Peninsular compatriots must not drown in short-term gains for the sake of humanity. Or even if Peninsular compatriots gain hundreds of thousands of yen in profit, they must absolutely wash their hands of the opium business as soon as possible, even one day sooner. If we were to permanently engage in this illicit business, it is clearer than fire that the Chinese people will not interact with us Peninsular people with good feelings. <85>\n\nPeninsular Compatriots in Mudanjiang\nBy Kim Sam-yŏl\n\n(Mudanjiang) Mudanjiang City is located in the northeastern part of Manchukuo and is the provincial capital of Mudanjiang Province. Mudanjiang Province was newly established on July 1, Showa 12 (1937). The city was reorganized into a municipality on November 3, Showa 12 (1937), making it a newly emerging city. Mudanjiang City was entirely constructed after the founding of the nation based on strategic necessity.\nAt the time of the nation's founding, around Showa 7 (1932), it was merely a village with a population of only 4,500. However, ten years later today, it has achieved astonishing development, reaching a population of over 200,000 and ranking among the important cities in Manchukuo. Accompanying such development, our Peninsular compatriots residing near Mudanjiang City are also exerting their utmost efforts to make this astonishing development a microcosm of the advancing Manchukuo Empire. Below is a brief account introducing the news of the Peninsular people residing in Mudanjiang City.\nOur Peninsular people account for about one-fourth of the total population of over 200,000, with the number of households reaching approximately 10,000. These people have increased since Showa 8 (1933), and about seventy percent reside in the southwestern part of the city, forming a complete Peninsular town where they live collectively. The remaining thirty percent are scattered throughout the city's various districts, and about twenty percent live in the city's suburban areas engaged in agriculture.\nIn essence, our Peninsular people are also part of the municipal auxiliary organs and a type of self-governing body. The West District is led by District Head Mr. Kang Ye-hwan (姜禮桓), who is also responsible for general administrative aspects.\nIn education, nine elementary schools (國民學校) for Peninsular children are managed by the City School Union (市學校組合), with the mayor serving as the union president and Mr. Kim Sŭng-gi (金昇起) as vice president; the number of students reaches 5,000. The annual expenses of the school union are roughly as follows:\nWest District annual budget: 68,000 yen\nCity School Union budget: 190,000 yen\nObserving from an economic perspective, the assets of Peninsular people total approximately 20 million yen, but there are no major capitalists in the city. The main reason for this, besides the rapid development due to it being a new city, is primarily that our country is currently under a wartime structure in an emergency situation, implementing economic controls. Seeing the Peninsular populace generally leading calm and composed economic lives even in such times is truly encouraging. As one example, last year, Peninsular people's national defense donations (國防獻金), contributions to the Soldiers' Support Association (軍人後援會賛助金), and donations to other social projects amounted to about 80,000 yen, plus tens of thousands of yen donated for education.\nThe Peninsular people residing in Mudanjiang are striving hard, considering Manchukuo their second homeland.\nIn the city, there are no splendid pleasure palaces, so to speak, to intoxicate young people, nor are there so-called modern cultural facilities.\nIn short, the city was rapidly constructed from a defense perspective, built with the bare minimum of materials.\nSuperficially, it is an extremely stark and newly emerging city.\nHowever, even though it is such a simple, newly emerging city, the residents have not forgotten the hidden truth that it is being built with vibrant, burning hope and based on lofty ideals and beliefs. I specifically note and convey this to offer some reference to the readers, which would be my greatest fortune. <86>\n\nThe Influence of Peninsular People in French Indochina\nBy Ha Tong-hwan\n\nI traveled to French Indochina (佛印) in the winter of Showa 8 (1933). Though I departed Korea wrapped in winter clothes, when I disembarked at the Haiphong docks, it was warm enough to remind me of midsummer in Korea. On the streets, the refreshing sight of Annamese girls (安南姑娘) in stylish straw hats, and in the parks, green lawns and blooming flowers—it was as if I had stepped into another world. Although I had imagined what the sights and feelings might be like, for me, visiting a perpetually summer country for the first time, everything was truly strange.\nHaiphong: Haiphong is the best port in the Gulf of Tonkin, with regular ferry services to Hong Kong, making transportation frequent. In the city, there are many magnificent buildings such as provincial government offices and schools, and there is also a military force of two divisions. Commercially, the Chinese hold absolute dominance, followed by Indians. It is noteworthy that in recent years, the Annamese people have gradually become more civilized and are actively participating in various fields. The Peninsular compatriots are Mr. Chŏn Sŏng-hwa (田成和), who runs the Koryŏ Products Trading Company (高麗物産商會), and Mr. Yi Chi-yong (李枝用) of the Sŏkyu Inn (石由旅舘)—only these two.\nHanoi: A train journey of just over three hours from Haiphong brings one to Hanoi, the capital of French Indochina. Hanoi is the center of politics, military affairs, and economy. Politically, it is the seat of the Governor-General of French Indochina, and there are consulates from various countries. Militarily, it is the location of the French Indochina Army General Headquarters. Economically, it is a transportation hub where goods gather and disperse extensively, and commerce thrives. Due to these circumstances, the number of Peninsular people residing here is relatively large, mostly engaged in commerce. Before the Sino-Japanese Incident, there were twenty-one resident Peninsular people. Except for three or four who ran fixed shops, all were peddlers. This was because, at that time, peddling yielded better income than fixed businesses. However, after the Incident, peddlers were regarded as spies by the authorities of this country, and most were ordered to leave, leaving only a few now. What should be specially noted is Mr. Kim Yŏng-gŏn (金永健), a representative figure among Peninsular compatriots in French Indochina. He once held the position of department head of East Asian History at the French Indochina Far East Expo Graduate School (佛印遠東博大學院東洋史科) [likely EFEO or similar], and was not only treated well by the French Indochina authorities but also made unforgettable contributions for the sake of Peninsular compatriots. With the Incident, he resigned from his post and is now working at the Tokyo French Indochina Association (東京佛印協曾).\nThe Recent Situation of Peninsular People in French Indochina: What kind of businesses were Peninsular compatriots in French Indochina engaged in? The vast majority ran ginseng businesses, solely focused on saving money and returning to their homeland as quickly as possible. Consequently, there was no room for development, and even today, forty years later, there is absolutely no change from the time they first advanced into French Indochina, which is truly disheartening.\nIn contrast, the advance of mainland Japanese (内地人) into French Indochina began more than ten years after that of Peninsular compatriots, yet their progress is astonishing. To give one example, a certain pioneer of mainland Japanese development in French Indochina, the proprietor of the Dainan Kōshi (大南公司) in Hanoi, initially peddled barber tools when he first arrived in French Indochina. Now, he has amassed enormous wealth, established branches even in Saigon in southern French Indochina, and is a key player in Japan-French Indochina trade. This is merely one example; there are none among the mainland Japanese who have not achieved considerable success. This is solely the result of their efforts for the overseas development of mainland Japanese, with the resolve to bury their bones in French Indochina. Although various special circumstances may have existed at the time, the lack of progress and apathy of Peninsular compatriots in French Indochina is truly shameful. If we Peninsular compatriots had built a foundation like the mainland Japanese, what remarkable activities and development might we have initiated upon the historic turning point in East Asia, the stationing of the Imperial Army (皇軍) in French Indochina? Thinking of this brings only long sighs.\nFrench Indochina's gold deposits are also quite abundant, especially\n(Continued on page 89) <87>\n\"The Influence of Peninsular People in French Indochina\" Continued (Continued from page 71) [Note: source page reference likely incorrect, should be 87]\nThere is much placer gold along the banks of the Mekong River (メメン河畔). During my stay in French Indochina, I conducted an on-site investigation of this and applied to the French Indochina authorities for mining permission, but it was not granted, and I returned empty-handed. Now, with the stationing [of Japanese troops] in French Indochina, and the conclusion of a new Japan-French Indochina trade treaty, not only gold but also other underground treasures of French Indochina will gradually be developed by the progress of Japanese assets and technology.\nRecent Situation of the Annamese People: France's colonial policy is extremely harsh, severely suppressing the cultural and external development of the Annamese people. For example, although they adopted a policy of absolutely prohibiting foreign travel for Annamese people, in recent years, the Annamese have gradually become civilized, illiteracy has decreased, and their admiration and trust towards Japan and the Japanese people are extraordinary. Perhaps it is only the Annamese people who wholeheartedly welcome the current stationing [of Japanese troops] in French Indochina. The character of the Annamese people is gentle, and their food resembles that of Korea. Economically, they are wealthier than Korea due to two harvests per year and an abundance of various fruits. Among the Annamese, the number of women is extremely large, with a female-to-male ratio of eleven to one. Therefore, women's rights are strong, and the activity of women in all industrial sectors is noteworthy. —(End)— <89>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis 1942 article from *Samch'ŏlli* magazine presents four reports on Korean communities in Japanese-occupied Nanjing, Beijing, Manchukuo (Mudanjiang), and French Indochina. The reports detail the increasing migration of Koreans following Japanese expansion, describing population numbers (e.g., 500 in Nanjing, 20,000+ in Beijing, 50,000 in Mudanjiang), settlement patterns (often forming distinct Korean districts), economic activities ranging from legitimate trade and labor to illicit businesses like opium dealing (criticized in the Beijing report), community organizations (schools, associations), and interactions with Japanese authorities and local populations. While some reports express optimism about future prospects (Nanjing, Mudanjiang), others lament a perceived lack of long-term vision or ethical conduct among Koreans compared to mainland Japanese settlers (Beijing, French Indochina). For historians, this article provides valuable contemporary insights into the diverse experiences of Koreans under Japanese colonialism, revealing demographic data, socio-economic conditions within the diaspora, the complexities of navigating life under imperial rule, and the official (pro-Japanese) narrative framing their role in the expanding empire. The candid criticism of Korean involvement in the opium trade in Beijing and the comparison with successful \"mainland Japanese\" settlers are particularly revealing aspects of the colonial dynamic and internal community issues.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n南京\t난징\tNanjing\n木下至切\t기노시타 시세쓰\tKinoshita Shisetsu\n牡丹江\t무단장/모란강\tMudanjiang\n金三悅\t김삼열\tKim Sam-yŏl\n北京\t베이징\tBeijing\n靑山文作\t아오야마 분사쿠\tAoyama Bunsaku\n佛印\t불인\tFrench Indochina (Futsuin)\n河東永煥\t하동환\tHa Tong-hwan\n朝鮮\t조선\tKorea (Chosŏn)\n淸朝\t청조\tQing Dynasty\n明\t명\tMing Dynasty\n天津\t톈진\tTianjin\n上海\t상하이\tShanghai\n濟南\t지난\tJinan\n中華民國\t중화민국\tRepublic of China\n尹永保\t윤영보\tYun Yŏng-bo\n蘇州胡同\t쑤저우 후퉁\tSuzhou Hutong\n泡子胡同\t파오쯔 후퉁\tPaozi Hutong\n滿洲事變\t만주사변\tManchurian Incident\n支那事變\t지나사변\tChina Incident (Second Sino-Japanese War)\n民會\t민회\tResidents' Association (Minhoe/Minkai)\n朝日テント合資會社\t아사히 텐트 합자회사\tAsahi Tent Limited Partnership Company\n××鑛業會社\t××광업회사\tXX Mining Company\n宋百憲\t송백헌\tSong Paek-hŏn\n開明戱院\t개명희원\tKaemyŏng Theater (Kaiming Gijō)\n崔鳳瑞\t최봉서\tCh'oe Pong-sŏ\n華北戱院\t화북희원\tHwabuk Theater (Kahoku Gijō)\n滿洲國\t만주국\tManchukuo\n姜禮桓\t강례환\tKang Ye-hwan\n金昇起\t김승기\tKim Sŭng-gi\n市學校組合\t시 학교조합\tCity School Union (Shi Gakkō Kumiai)\n軍人後援會\t군인후원회\tSoldiers' Support Association (Gunjin Kōenkai)\n海防\t하이퐁\tHaiphong\n香港\t홍콩\tHong Kong\n安南\t안남\tAnnam (Vietnam)\n河內\t하노이\tHanoi\n田成和\t전성화\tChŏn Sŏng-hwa\n高麗物産商會\t고려물산상회\tKoryŏ Products Trading Company (Kōrai Bussan Shōkai)\n李枝用\t이지용\tYi Chi-yong\n石由旅舘\t석유여관\tSŏkyu Inn (Sekiyū Ryokan)\n金永健\t김영건\tKim Yŏng-gŏn\n佛印遠東博大學院\t불인원동박대학원\tFrench Indochina Far East Expo Graduate School (Futsuin Entō Haku Daigakuin)\n東京佛印協曾\t도쿄 불인협회\tTokyo French Indochina Association (Tōkyō Futsuin Kyōkai)\n大南公司\t대남공사\tDainan Kōshi\n西貢\t사이공\tSaigon\nメメン河畔\t메콩 강변\tMekong Riverbank\n佛蘭西\t프랑스\tFrance\n\n**Glossary**\n\n半島人\tはんとうじん\tPeninsular people (referring to Koreans)\n邦家\tほうか\tOur nation/state (referring to Japan)\n事變\tじへん\tIncident (referring to Manchurian Incident/Sino-Japanese War)\n緣\tえん\tConnection, tie, fate\n氣息荏苒\tきそくじんぜん\tBarely breathing, lingering weakly (classical expression)\n地盤\tじばん\tFoundation, base, foothold\n土臺\tどだい\tFoundation, groundwork\n懸命\tけんめい\tEarnestly, desperately\n敏活\tびんかつ\tAgile, active, nimble\n千載一遇\tせんざいいちぐう\tOnce in a thousand years opportunity\n淺眼\tせんがん\tShallow view, superficial perspective\n斯る\tかかる\tSuch, like this\n誌上\tしじょう\tIn the pages of a magazine\n依賴\tいらい\tRequest\n過重\tかじゅう\tExcessive, too heavy\n頗る\tすこぶる\tExtremely, very\n沿革\tえんかく\tHistory, development\n不平客\tふへいきゃく\tDisgruntled person, political dissident (lit.

This is because they observe our country's actions with a viewpoint derived from their own wicked thoughts and ambitions, perhaps thinking it harmful to the achievement of their own ambitions. Our country treads the path of righteousness and has nothing to fear; we must simply push forward. It is they themselves who should reflect and repent.\n\n× ×\n\nIf there is a seed that disturbs the peace of the Pacific in the Pacific problem, it is, without question, the ambitions and prejudices of the nations of Great Britain and the United States. It is their wicked thought to forcibly prevent the restoration of peace in China and to monopolize and occupy the prosperity and welfare of the nations of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.\n\nIt is their tyranny that seeks to darken the future of our country, which has struggled, raising its national strength, with the peace of the world, and especially the peace of East Asia, as its earnest desire. If they would only once become open-minded, face the situation squarely, and wish for the welfare of the East Asian peoples, they should suddenly realize the error of their past ways and change their policies. To resort to armed conflict before reaching that point is too roundabout and too wasteful. It is the height of stupidity that these nations, such as Great Britain and the United States, who are inherently clever, skilled in calculating profit and loss, and who preach peace and humanity like a habit, do not know whether applying military pressure to our country will truly achieve what they desire.\n\n× ×\n\nHowever, if their utterly foolish actions continue to allow the cause of misfortune to grow, without even a re-recognition of East Asia based on our country's truth and sincerity, then that too cannot be helped. It goes without saying that our country must faithfully advance towards its beliefs and charge forward to the complete fulfillment of the people's earnest desire. The resolve of our people is already fixed and shines brightly. Now, even if a hundred thunderbolts were to fall at our feet, we should not be alarmed in the slightest, but calmly walk our path forward. It is probably difficult to hope that the various nations will reflect <88> and repent. For us as a people, it is unacceptable to neglect preparations or relax our vigilance, counting on such a remote possibility. As the new Prime Minister Tōjō swore to the people as head of the cabinet in the government statement at 7 p.m. on October 18th, \"The path to breaking through the current difficulties lies, under His Majesty's august virtue, solely in iron will and swift, precise execution.\" The one hundred million people must also place rock-solid trust in the swift and resolute actions based on this new premier's iron conviction, and no matter what situation unfolds, they must solidify their iron unity and push forward to overcome the crisis.\n\n× ×\n\nUniversal conscription is the great principle upon which our nation was founded. However, it is something the entire populace has long been well aware of that even those who, through certain processes, cannot become soldiers should still resolve to serve on the home front with the spirit of a soldier. Especially, the several million eligible workers on the peninsula, burning with supreme patriotism, should rise up fiercely at this time. Recently, the term \"universal labor\" has become popular, and this too should be deeply appreciated and embodied as the mindset of the entire populace in wartime. There should not be a single idle person among the people; all should dedicate themselves to matters useful to the state with the mindset of a worker. If the entire nation becomes one and confronts matters with a spirit like iron and fire, what in the world is there to fear? So-called \"universal labor\" is not just a rhetorical slogan. Even the old, young, sick, and weak must at least grasp its spirit and translate into action, without forgetting for a moment, doing their utmost according to their capacity.\n—(End)—<89>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis editorial, written shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor and the appointment of Prime Minister Tōjō Hideki, argues passionately for Japan's mission to establish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and resolve the \"China Incident.\" It portrays Japan's actions as righteous and driven by a desire for peace in East Asia, while condemning Britain and the United States as selfish, ambitious powers hindering Japan's noble goals through prejudice and meddling. The author calls for unwavering national unity, resolve (\"iron will\"), and total mobilization (\"universal conscription,\" \"universal labor\") under the new leadership, urging the populace, explicitly including Koreans (\"several million eligible workers on the peninsula\"), to dedicate themselves fully to the war effort without fear or hesitation. Historians would find this article valuable as a clear example of Japanese wartime propaganda disseminated in colonial Korea, justifying aggression, demonizing the Allies, and promoting the total mobilization of the Japanese empire, including its colonial subjects, under slogans like \"universal labor.\" The specific call to action for Koreans highlights the increasing demands placed upon them as the war expanded.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n國民總力朝鮮聯盟 宣傳部\tこくみんそうりょくちょうせんれんめい せんでんぶ\tKokumin Sōryoku Chōsen Renmei Sendenbu (Propaganda Department, National Service Korea League)\n星野忠勇\tほしのただゆう\tHoshino Tadayū\n支那事變\tしなじへん\tShina Jihen (China Incident)\n東亞共榮圈\tとうあきょうえいけん\tTōa Kyōeiken (Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere)\n英米\tえいべい\tEi-Bei (Britain and America)\n太平洋\tたいへいよう\tTaiheiyō (Pacific Ocean)\n東亞\tとうあ\tTōa (East Asia)\n東條新首相\tとうじょうしんしゅしょう\tTōjō Shin-shushō (New Prime Minister Tōjō)\n半島\tはんとう\tHantō (Peninsula [referring to Korea])\n\n**Glossary**\n\n念願\tねんがん\tEarnest desire, cherished wish\n支那事變\tしなじへん\tChina Incident (Japanese term for the Second Sino-Japanese War)\n東亞共榮圈\tとうあきょうえいけん\tGreater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\n容喙\tようかい\tMeddling, interfering\n邁進\tまいしん\tPushing forward vigorously\n橫暴\tおうぼう\tTyranny, high-handedness\n虛心坦懷\tきょしんたんかい\tWith an open and unbiased mind\n禍因\tかいん\tCause of misfortune/disaster\n炳乎\tへいこ\tClearly, brightly\n時艱\tじかん\tDifficult times, current crisis\n御稜威\tみいつ\tAugust virtue/majesty (of the Emperor)\n鐵石\tてっせき\tIron and stone; implying firmness, resolution\n磐石\tばんじゃく\tHuge rock; implying solid, unshakable\n國民皆兵\tこくみんかいへい\tUniversal conscription, every citizen a soldier\n銃後奉公\tじゅうごほうこう\tHome front service/support\n夙に\tつとに\tLong ago, for a long time\n勤勞適格者\tきんろうてきかくしゃ\tEligible workers\n國民皆勞\tこくみんかいろう\tUniversal labor, every citizen a worker\n遊休者\tゆうきゅうしゃ\tIdle person\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n잡지명\t삼천리 제14권 제1호\n발행일\t1942년 01월 01일\n기사제목\t國民の念願\n필자\t國民總力朝鮮聯盟 宣傳部 星野忠勇\n기사형태\t논설\n\n國民の念願\n\t\t\t\t\t\t國民總力朝鮮聯盟 宣傳部 星野忠勇\n今日我國民共同の念願は支那事變の處理と東亞共榮圈の確立を急ぐことである。\n其間に何等排他的の雜念もなく利己的の陰謀もない。至公至平の心を以つて我國の行動を見る者からすれば、我國に對して一點の非難を加ふることなく、寧ろ我國を支援して其念願を一日も早やく達せしむことと努むることである。而も英米等の諸國は敢て東亞の事に容喙して我國の前進を阻み、我國の念願を妨げるのは、却て彼等自身の邪念と野心とから割り出したる見方を以て我國の行動を觀察しそれが或は彼等自身の野望の達成に害あることを思ふか爲めである。我國は正を履んで恐るゝ所なく、只邁進すべきのみであり、反省し改悔すべきは彼等自身である。\n×  ×\n太平洋の問題に太平洋の平和を攪亂する種ありとすれば、それは問ふまでもなく英米諸國の野望であり、偏見である。强て支那の平和恢復を妨げんとし、東亞共榮圈諸國の利福を壟斷し占有せんとする彼等の邪念である。\n世界の平和、殊の東亞の平和を念として國力を擧げて奮鬪せる我國の前途を暗くせんとする彼等の橫暴である。彼等にして一旦虛心坦懷、事態を正視し東亞民族の福祉を願念するに於ては、飜然從米の非を悟りて其の政策を轉換すべきである。兵火に訴へて然る後とゝに至るは餘りに迂遠であり、餘りに浪費過ぎる。元々聰明にして利害の打算に長け、且つ癖のやうに平和人道を唱ふる英米等これらの諸國が、武力を持つて我國に威壓を加へて果して彼等の思ふ壺にはまるかを知らざるは愚鈍の至りである。\n×  ×\nしかし、彼等の愚鈍極まる行動も、我國の眞實と誠意籠る、東亞への再認識はおろか、依然として禍因の增大に任すとすれば之も亦致し方ない。我國としては飽迄もその所信に向つて忠實に、國民的念願の完遂に突進すべきは言を俟たない。我國民の覺悟は旣に定まつて炳乎としてゐる。今更百雷足下に落つるも何等驚く所なく泰然として其進路を步むべきである。諸國が反省＜88＞し改悔するは恐らくは望み難い。其萬一をあてにして準備を怠り覺り弛うするが如きは我國民として有る可からざる所である。東條新首相が、内閣首班として、國民に誓つた十月十八日午後七時の政府聲明にも『時艱突破の途は御稜威の下、たゞ鐵石の意志と迅速的確なる實行にあり』と云はれて居る。一億國民も、この新宰相の鐵石の信念に基く迅速果敢なる行動に磐石の信賴を置き、いかなる事態が展開されやうとも、鐵石の團結を固めて難局の打開に邁進すべである。\n×  ×\n國民皆兵は我國立國の大主義である。しかし或る過程において兵たるを得ざる者もなほ兵たる心持を以て銃後奉公を期すべきは國民全體の夙に熟知せる所である。殊に愛國の至情に燃え立つた、半島幾百萬の勤勞適格者は、此の際猛然と振ひ立つべきである。最近國民皆勞の語が流行するも、是亦戰時下に於ける國民全體の心かけとして大に翫味し且體得すべき所である。國民中一人の遊休者なく、全部が勤勞者たる心持を以て國家有用の事に盡すべきである。全國民一丸となつて鐵火の如き精神を以て事に當るとすれば、天下何ものか恐るべき者あらん。所謂國民皆勞は只の美辭的標語ではない。老幼病弱者といへども少くとも其精神を感得して其分に應じて最善を盡すことを寸時も忘れず行動に移して行かねばならないのである。\n—(終)—＜89＞\n＜88-89＞","magazine":"삼천리 제14권 제1호","date":"1942년 01월 01일","title":"[Japanese] The People's Earnest Desire (Kokumin no Nengan)"},{"path":"89_14.01_1942.01/140.txt","issue":"89_14.01_1942.01","content":"Why Did I Volunteer as a Volunteer Soldier?\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Yashima Hideo, Graduate of Tokyo Hōsei University\n\nIn view of the grave situation facing Asia, under the title \"Why Did I Volunteer as a Volunteer Soldier?\", I wish to state some of my feelings and contribute to the passionate awakening of my Peninsula compatriots. We call today's situation an emergency.\n\nNow, what is this emergency facing our Empire? It is the voice of the people's struggle, longing for a heroic nation. Five years have already passed since the Holy War began in Asia. Now, at a time when the Empire is encountering an unprecedentedly grave international situation, I keenly feel the need for us, as subjects of the Imperial Nation, to re-examine what we ought to accomplish.\n\nWhen I think of the struggles in combat and aerial warfare of the Imperial Army officers and soldiers standing on the front lines, undeterred by extreme cold or heat, having the same duty and bearing the name of men, how can we stand idly by? At this juncture, as one of the twenty-four million compatriots of the Peninsula, I most fervently wish to know their passionate existence. Although I myself cannot fully grasp the extent of the inner awakening of our Peninsula compatriots as subjects of the Empire, looking at the superficial current state, at any rate, I still feel something is lacking. Why? Because today, under a full recognition of the current situation, we must advocate for true Japan-Korea unity (內鮮一體), and as subjects of the Empire, we must strive with even greater proactive duty to overcome the national crisis. Only when we serve without fear of death, standing on the front lines of the national crisis, will the mission of our Great Japanese Empire be achieved.\n\nIt has been thirty-one years since we became subjects of the Great Japanese Empire, and today, as we are about to greet the glorious 2,601st year of the Imperial era, the pass where we held different consciousness and different passions is now far behind us. The only mission left for us today is the construction of Greater East Asia and contribution to the world through the powerful unity of one hundred million hearts as one body and its passionate implementation. This is not something we devised just now; it is what the times have made so, a grand policy already assigned to us by our ancestors in days past, and our destined great mission from birth.\n\nOnly when we, the twenty-four million compatriots, exert our total strength, stand together, abandon egoistic notions, embrace the greater self, and contribute on a grand Asian scale under the national policy of the Great Japanese Empire, will fragrance arise from the soil of our Peninsula, and we will be able to live in peace and comfort.\n\nThe path has been opened for us Peninsula compatriots to fulfill our equal duties as subjects of the Empire and assert our equal rights. This is the establishment of the epoch-making, great and decisive Army Special Volunteer Soldier system. By fulfilling this duty, we gain powerful rights, and I believe this holds true significance for us as subjects of the Great Japanese Empire. However, perhaps because we Peninsula compatriots haven't yet thought it through <90> enough, we are not practical, we are egoistic, and we think too much about our own contemporary pleasures. For this reason, I think we must seriously reflect on the fact that we are still small-minded people today. I believe that only when we become more passionate practitioners, unafraid of death, willing to be sacrifices, can the current national crisis be easily overcome, and beautiful flowers bloom for all the peoples of Asia. One day, an eighteen or nineteen-year-old youth was traveling in the countryside when he saw an old man, looking as if he might sink into the earth at any moment, planting citrus seeds. The youth found this incredibly strange. He immediately went up to the old man and asked, \"Grandfather, you look like you might die any day now. If you plant those seeds now, will those citrus fruits ever reach your mouth?\" The old man then became very agitated and said, \"It's because our ancestors were like you that I haven't been able to eat mandarin oranges until now!\" This might be a joke, but the delicious mandarin oranges we eat today might also be thanks to that old man. This is precisely the spirit of the pioneer (開柘民), the passionate practitioner. Likewise, that the Great Japanese Empire possesses a glorious history of over 2,600 years and is called the world's greatest power – whose strength is this due to? Knowing this principle, how can we fear death and stand idly by? I believe this is a national duty passed down through generations for the subjects of the Great Japanese Empire.\n\nCountless numbers of our Imperial compatriots have thrown their lives into overcoming this grave national crisis. We shall surely never forget the death of our senior, Superior Private Ri Jinseki (李仁錫). That we live in some comfort today is entirely the gift of the blood of our predecessors; what else could it be? Needless to say for the one hundred million compatriots, at this time, I especially pray for the passionate public service of the Peninsula compatriots. <91>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe author, Yashima Hideo, a Korean graduate of Tokyo Hōsei University, explains his reasons for volunteering for the Japanese Army. Writing in early 1942, he emphasizes the \"grave situation\" facing the Empire and Asia, urging fellow Koreans (\"Peninsula compatriots\") to recognize their duty as Imperial subjects. He argues that Koreans must abandon \"egoism,\" embrace Japan-Korea unity (Naissen Ittai), and actively participate in the \"Holy War\" by volunteering through the recently established Army Special Volunteer Soldier system. He presents volunteering as the path to achieving equal rights and contributing to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, framing sacrifice as a generational duty necessary for future prosperity, citing the example of Superior Private Ri Jinseki. For historians, this article is a clear example of pro-Japanese collaborationist rhetoric aimed at mobilizing Korean support for Japan's war effort during the colonial period. It vividly illustrates the promotion of the volunteer soldier system and the ideology of Imperial subjecthood (皇國臣民) and Naissen Ittai being propagated among Koreans.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n東京法政大學\tとうきょうほうせいだいがく\tTokyo Hōsei University\n八島秀雄\tやしまひでお\tYashima Hideo\n亞細亞\tアジア\tAsia\n半島\tはんとう\tPeninsula (referring to Korea)\n帝國\tていこく\tEmpire (referring to Japan)\n皇軍\tこうぐん\tImperial Army\n皇國臣民\tこうこくしんみん\tSubjects of the Imperial Nation\n內鮮一體\tないせんいったい\tJapan-Korea Unity\n大日本帝國\tだいにっぽんていこく\tGreat Japanese Empire\n大東亞\tだいとうあ\tGreater East Asia\n李仁錫\tりじんせき\tRi Jinseki\n\n**Glossary**\n\n志願兵\tしがんへい\tVolunteer soldier\n時局\tじきょく\tThe current situation; the times (often implying a crisis)\n鑑み\tかんがみ\tIn view of; considering\n同胞\tどうほう\tCompatriots; brethren\n奮起\tふんき\tArousing oneself; stirring to action\n皇國臣民\tこうこくしんみん\tSubjects of the Imperial Nation\n內在的\tないざいてき\tIntrinsic; inherent\n覺心\tかくしん\tAwakening; realization\n物足らなさ\tものたらなさ\tFeeling that something is lacking; dissatisfaction\n內鮮一體\tないせんいったい\tJapan-Korea Unity (policy/slogan promoting assimilation)\n提唱\tていしょう\tAdvocacy; promotion\n國難打破\tこくなんだは\tOvercoming the national crisis\n卒先\tそっせん\tTaking the initiative; leading\n奉公\tほうこう\tPublic service; service to the state/emperor\n達成\tたっせい\tAchievement; accomplishment\n峠\tとうげ\tMountain pass; peak; crisis point (metaphorical)\n使命\tしめい\tMission; mandate\n團結\tだんけつ\tUnity; solidarity\n實踐化\tじっせんか\tPutting into practice; implementation\n賦課\tふか\tImposition (of a duty, tax, etc.)\n總力\tそうりょく\tTotal power; all-out effort\n利己主義\tりこしゅぎ\tEgoism; selfishness\n大我\tたいが\tThe greater self; selflessness\n國策\tこくさく\tNational policy\n劃期的大英斷\tかっきてきだいえいだん\tEpoch-making great decision\n異義\tいぎ\tObjection; dissent (Here contextually means 'without objection' or 'duty')\n權利\tけんり\tRight; privilege\n實踐的\tじっせんてき\tPractical\n享樂\tきょうらく\tEnjoyment; pleasure\n犧牲物\tぎせいぶつ\tSacrifice (thing or person)\n麗しき\tうるわしき\tBeautiful; lovely\n開柘民\tかいたくみん\tPioneer; settler (Figurative: those who build for the future)\n光榮\tこうえい\tGlory; honor\n身命\tしんめい\tLife\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n잡지명\t삼천리 제14권 제1호\n발행일\t1942년 01월 01일\n기사제목\t余は何故に志願兵を志願したるか?\n필자\t東京法政大學出身 八島秀雄\n기사형태\t회고·수기\n\n余は何故に志願兵を志願したるか?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t東京法政大學出身 八島秀雄\n私は亞細亞に直面した重大時局に鑑み余は何故に志願兵を志願したるかと云ふ題の下に少しの私の感するところを述べ半島同胞の熱ある奮起に資し度いものであります。吾々は今日の時局を非常時と呼んで居ります。\n然らは我が帝國に直面した非常時とは如何なるものかと云ひまするに其れは英雄的國民を待望する民家の鬪の聲であります。亞細亞に聖戰始つて旣に五ケ年、時局は今や帝國は未曾有の重大國際時局に逢着せんの時吾等は皇國臣民として果して何を成す可きかと云ふ事を再檢討するの要あるを痛感するのであります。\n酷寒や酷暑を物ともせず第1線に立つ皇軍將兵の奮鬪や空鬪を考へる時、同じ責務を有し男子たる名を持つた以上、吾等は何をして起たずに居られませう。此際私は半島二千四百萬同胞の一人として最も其の熱ぁる存在を知り度いものであります。吾等半島同胞が帝國臣民として其の内在的覺心が如何程の構であるかは自分としても充分察し得られない事ではありますが、兎に角表面的の現狀から見ますれば、未だ物足らなさを感するものであります。何故ならば今日、吾々が充分なる時局認識の下に眞の內鮮一體を提唱し帝國臣民としての吾等は國難打破へと卒先的により以上の義務を以て努力をせねばならないからであります。吾々が死を恐れず國難の第一線に立つて奉公する時こそ我が大日本帝國の使命は達成せらるるのであります。\n吾々は大日本帝國臣民たること三十一ケ年、光輝ある紀元二千六百一年を送らんとする今日吾々が異つた意識と異つた情熱を持つ峠はもう遙かに越えでいるのであります。今日唯吾等に残された使命は一億一心一體の力强き團結と熱ある實踐化に依るところの大東亞の建設であり、世界的貢獻であります。是は今頃吾等の考案でもなり、時代がしからしめ昔日旣に吾等の祖先が吾等に賦課した一大政策でもあり、生れながらの吾等の運命的の大使命でもあります。\n吾々二千四百萬同胞が總力、總立利己主義的な觀念を捨てて大我を取り、大日本帝國の國策の下に大亞細亞的に貢獻する時こそ我が半島の土に香を生み吾々は安樂に暮す事が出來るのであります。\n吾等半島同胞が帝國臣民としての平等なる義務を果し、平等なる權利を主張し得る道は開かれたのであります。之郎を劃期的大英斷になる陸軍特別志願兵制度の制定であります。之を吾々は異義なり、果すことに依つて吾等に力强き權利もあり、大日本帝國臣民として眞の意義があると思ふのであります。然るに吾等半島同胞は未だ考へ付＜90＞かない關係か實踐的でなく、利己的であり、自分當代の享樂を餘り考へ過ぎる爲めに吾々は今日尙も小さい人間であることを大いに考へるベきたと思ふのであります。吾々はもつと〱熱情ある實踐者として死を恐れず犧牲物であればこそ始めて現國難も容易に打破せられ、全亞細亞民族に麗しき花を咲かせることが出來ると思ふのであります。或る日十八·九歳の少年が田舍旅をしていると今にも土の中に迫入りさぅな年寄りのおぢいさんが密柑の種子を蒔いてゐるのを見ると少年は不思議でたまらない。直ちに其のおぢいさんに向つておぢいさんは今にも死んで行きさうな年寄りが其の種子を今蒔いて其の密柑がおぢいさんの口に迫入れますかと問つたのであります。すると其のおぢいさんは非常に興奮して吾等の祖先がお前のやうであつた爲めに私が今迄蜜柑が食べないと云つたのでありました。笑談かも知れませんが今日我等が美味さうに食べている密柑もあのおぢいさんの御蔭でもありませう。之れが卽ち開柘民の精神であり、熱ある實踐者であります。斯樣に大日本帝國が光榮ある二千六百餘年の歷史を有し世界最大强國と云はれでゐるのは一體誰の力でありませう。斯くの如き道理を知った吾々は何をして死を恐れ起たずに居られませう。之は大日本帝國臣民として代々に渡る、國民的の義務と私は思つて居ります。\n我帝國同胞が此の重大國難打破の爲めに數知らしずの身命を投込み、最も吾等の先輩李仁錫上等兵の死を吾々は永遠に忘れることが出來ないでせう。吾等が今日少し安力に暮しているのは之全く先輩方々の血の賜のでなく、何でありませう。一億同胞は勿論の事、私は此際特に半島同胞の熱ある奉公を祈ります。＜91＞\n＜90-91＞","magazine":"삼천리 제14권 제1호","date":"1942년 01월 01일","title":"[Japanese] Why Did I Volunteer as a Soldier?

Concept and Types of Economic Crimes\nEconomic crimes refer to cases violating controlled economy regulations. Excluding those belonging to special sectors among controlled economy regulations, the laws and ordinances that are generally and universally applied, which we usually treat as economic cases, are typically the following three:\n1. Violation of the National Mobilization Law (國家總動員法)\n2. Temporary Measures Law Concerning Export and Import Goods (輸出入品에 관한 臨時 措置法)\n3. Violations of the Foreign Exchange Control Law (外國爲替管理法) and Chōsen Gold Production Ordinance (朝鮮産金令)\n\nAmong these, economic crimes related to the Foreign Exchange Control Law are a phenomenon rarely seen in Chōsen (朝鮮), and if they exist, they are limited to border cities like Sinŭiju (新義州), so they will be omitted here. I intend to primarily discuss violations of the National Mobilization Law and the Temporary Measures Law Concerning Export and Import Goods, which are closely related to the lives of our general populace.\n\nFirst, the National Mobilization Law refers to the controlled operation of human and material resources to most effectively exert the nation's full power for achieving defense objectives during wartime (including incidents equivalent to war).\nIn our country, the military first began drafting this law during the Manchurian Incident; abroad, Germany, in particular, enacted and currently operates this ordinance.\n\nSecond, the Temporary Measures Law Concerning Export and Import Goods signifies material adjustment and is roughly as follows.\nWhen the government deems it particularly necessary to secure the operation of the national economy in relation to the China Incident, it can take the following two measures regarding goods for which supply-demand relationship adjustments <93> are needed due to import restrictions or other reasons:\n1. To command necessary matters regarding the manufacturing of products using the relevant goods as raw materials, or impose restrictions, as stipulated by order.\n2. To issue necessary commands regarding the distribution, transfer, use, or consumption of the relevant goods or products using them as raw materials.\nAlthough simple, the above describes the concept and types of economic crimes.\n\n2. Economic Crimes Seen Through Numbers\nNow, if we look at the statistics of economic crimes across all of Chōsen by month from Shōwa 15 (1940) to June of Shōwa 16 (1941), it is as follows. Due to space limitations, the number of cases will be omitted, and only the number of persons involved will be recorded.\n\n[Translator's Note: The table mentioned in the text is missing.]\n\nFurthermore, looking at the statistics by type of economic crime within the Kyŏngsŏng jurisdiction since Shōwa 14 (1939), it is as follows.\n\n[Translator's Note: The table mentioned in the text is missing.]\n\n3. The Worsening Nature of Economic Crimes and Their Examples\nAs seen in the statistics above, economic crimes show a phenomenon of gradually increasing compared to the initial period, but there are several reasons for this. In the early stages, the laws and regulations were incomplete, and consequently, official prices (公定價格) or fixed prices (定止價格?) (918) could not be established, which was a major reason why criminal cases could hardly be formed. Therefore, initially, general business operators had a weak concept of the controlled economy, and because official prices were not established, there were even instances where sellers themselves were confused, not knowing if they were charging too much or too little, so the crimes were extremely simple and spontaneous. That is, there were many violations without malicious intent.\n\nHowever, entering the latter half of this year, as the international situation became more tense, enforcement was strengthened, and consequently, a strict punishment policy was adopted, causing the cases, which had been steadily increasing until the first half of this year, <95> to come to a complete standstill.\nOn the other hand, we find that criminal cases are becoming cleverly malicious to avoid surfacing. Now, several examples will be listed below.\n\nFirst, among economic crimes that are generally becoming more sophisticated are degrading the quality of goods or reducing their quantity. For example, when firewood and charcoal merchants (薪炭商) sell firewood, since it is now sold by the *ch'ŏk* (斥, unit of measure/weight), they sprinkle water on the wood to increase its weight, or lowering the quality of food are examples. Among the cases we previously handled, there was an incident where a rubber factory received high-quality raw rubber for its raw material mix but did not manufacture rubber shoes solely with that raw rubber. Instead, they mixed in already manufactured and worn-out rubber, degrading the quality. With the allocated mix for manufacturing 19,000 pairs, they produced 20,000 to 30,000 pairs.\n\nNext concerns non-standard goods (規格外品), primarily hats or textiles belong to this category.\n\nThird is the careful selection of the counterparty (相對人), meaning the seller sells above the official price but carefully chooses consumers who will not report them.\n\nFourth is deception in the payment method (大金支拂方法의 欺瞞). This involves making a 50 yen payment appear as 150 yen by having 100 yen paid in cash and the remaining 50 yen <96> paid by promissory note (手形), thus obscuring the evidence of the 100 yen payment. Deception in rent payment methods mainly belongs to this category.\n\nFifth is tie-in sales (包含販賣), also known as attached sales (添付販賣). This refers to when a merchant sells goods, they force the consumer to buy other goods besides the ones they requested. The consumer, crying foul but needing the desired item, inevitably buys unnecessary things as well. Thus, there are also malicious crimes that exploit the consumer's weakness in this way.\n\nSixth is using secret language (隱語) to deceive consumers and police, or collusion between buyer and seller to deceive others.\n\nSeventh is recording calculations in account books (帳簿) using coded characters (暗號文字).\n\nEighth is the emergence of black market groups (闇取引團) organized cleverly, such as hadn't been seen before, so that even if caught by the economic police, only one member becomes the criminal, while the rest of the gang avoids legal entanglement.\n\nThe eight types of cases described above are all actual criminal incidents. However, revealing the detailed criminal methods might have undesirable effects on some unscrupulous merchants, so I will refrain from doing so and merely list the types.\n\n4. Initial Phenomena and Recent Times\nAs mentioned above, economic crimes, which had been increasing dramatically each year, came to a sudden halt in the latter half of this year. This is due to the strengthening of enforcement, as previously stated. Therefore, recently, economic crimes have reached a very low level, and I believe they will decrease further in the future.\nCurrently, enforcement generally employs two approaches: the emphasis principle (重點主義) and the root-and-branch principle (拔本主義).<97> The emphasis principle, briefly put, aims to catch the small fry by targeting and apprehending major cases involving big players. The root-and-branch principle refers to a consistent, chain-like pursuit from production to consumption.\nOf course, we authorities will consider circumstances where violations occur unavoidably due to special situations. However, at this juncture, when the entire nation must unite to break through this unprecedented national crisis and construct Greater East Asia, if people still remain sunk in private gain and greed, forgetting the welfare of the whole, this is truly a great shame for the nation, and we intend to adhere strictly to a policy of severe punishment.\n\n5. What is Requested of the General Populace\nAt this time when the world situation is becoming increasingly tense and we face an unprecedented national crisis, we, the people, must abandon the mistaken individualistic and liberalistic economic consciousness that prioritized profit-seeking as the primary element of economic activity. We must grasp a new economic ethic based on totalitarianism (全體主義) and statism (國家主義) and strive for the precedence of public interest (公益優先). I strongly urge the people to make greater efforts to establish this new economic morality centered on the public mission based on such a national concept.\nFinally, officials and civilians must become one body, and in whatever workplace, mutually pledge their loyalty to serve the country until death (一死報國), thereby completing this sacred task (聖業) as quickly as possible.

The author defines these crimes mainly as violations of the National Mobilization Law and trade control laws. He notes an initial rise in simple violations due to unclear regulations, followed by a sharp decrease attributed to stricter enforcement and severe punishments. However, he observes that crimes are becoming more sophisticated and malicious, citing examples like quality degradation, measurement fraud, tie-in sales, coded bookkeeping, and organized black market groups. The author concludes by urging the Korean populace to abandon individualistic profit motives and embrace a \"new economic ethic\" based on totalitarianism, statism, and prioritizing public interest for the sake of Japan's war effort and the construction of Greater East Asia, calling for unity and willingness to \"serve the country until death.\"\n\nFor historians, this article is significant as it provides a direct view from a colonial legal official (an ethnic Korean collaborating under a Japanese name) on the enforcement of Japan's wartime economic controls in Korea. It reveals the state's perspective on economic non-compliance, the methods used by ordinary people and businesses to navigate or resist these controls, and the explicit promotion of totalitarian ideology (\"totalitarianism,\" \"statism,\" \"public interest first,\" \"serve the country until death\") demanded of the colonized population during the height of the Pacific War. The description of increasingly \"clever\" and \"malicious\" crimes offers insight into the pressures and responses within Korean society under intense wartime mobilization.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n半島\t반도\tPando (Korean Peninsula)\n京城 地方法院\t경성 지방법원\tKyŏngsŏng Chibang Pŏbŏn (Keijo District Court)\n德田仲仁\t도쿠다 나카히토\tTokuda Nakahito\n姜仲仁\t강중인\tKang Chung'in\n朝鮮\t조선\tChosŏn (Korea)\n新義州\t신의주\tSinŭiju\n滿洲事變\t만주사변\tManchu Sabyŏn (Manchurian Incident)\n獨逸\t독일\tTogil (Germany)\n支那事變\t지나사변\tChina Sabyŏn (China Incident)\n昭和\t쇼와\tShōwa\n京城\t경성\tKyŏngsŏng (Keijo/Seoul)\n大東亞\t대동아\tTae Tong'a (Greater East Asia)\n\n**Glossary**\n\n經濟事犯\t경제사범\tEconomic crime/offender\n統制經濟法規\t통제경제법규\tControlled economy regulations/laws\n國家總動員法\t국가총동원법\tNational Mobilization Law\n輸出入品\t수출입품\tExport and import goods\n臨時 措置法\t임시 조치법\tTemporary Measures Law\n外國爲替管理法\t외국위체관리법\tForeign Exchange Control Law\n朝鮮産金令\t조선산금령\tChōsen Gold Production Ordinance (Japanese Law)\n戰時\t전시\tWartime\n國防\t국방\tNational defense\n人的 及 物的 資源\t인적 및 물적 자원\tHuman and material resources\n滿洲事變\t만주사변\tManchurian Incident\n軍部\t군부\tMilitary authorities\n需給關係\t수급관계\tSupply-demand relationship\n配給\t배급\tDistribution/rationing\n讓渡\t양도\tTransfer/assignment\n消費\t소비\tConsumption\n公定價格\t공정가격\tOfficial price (set by government)\n定止價格\t정지가격\tFixed price (?)

Consequently, the damage sustained therein is also annihilating.\n\nIn the wars of the Greek era, the number of casualties in fierce battles did not exceed 2-3% of the troop strength, but in the Great European War [WWI], it reached 38.9% of the troop strength. Sociologist Sorokin (소로깅) has produced century-by-century figures for nine European countries—Austria, Great Britain, France, Russia, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and Poland—as shown in the separate table.\n\nFurthermore, if the number of casualties is divided by the population of the respective country, the Casualty Burden Index is obtained. The figures per 1,000 people for each country are as follows.<96>\nThe table includes foreign mercenaries in its calculation.\n\nMoreover, in the Russo-Japanese War (日露戰役) (1904-1905), Russia's total mobilized troop strength was 500,000, among which casualties were 170,000, meaning casualties amounted to 34% of the troop strength (Liaoyang 11%, Fengtian 23%, Battle of the Japan Sea 70%).\n\nAlso, in the First World War, the total mobilized troop strengths were 13,000,000 for Germany, 5,180,000 for Italy, 15,500,000 for Russia, and 7,500,000 for Great Britain, and the total casualties amounted to 6,060,000 (46.6%), 1,780,000 (34.3%), 5,500,000 (35%), and 3,070,000 (32.3%) respectively.<97>\n<96-97>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis 1942 article from the magazine *Samch'ŏlli* discusses the escalating scale of casualties in modern warfare due to advancements in weaponry. It contrasts casualty rates from ancient Greek wars with those of World War I, citing sociologist Sorokin's data for several European nations. It provides specific casualty figures and percentages for the Russo-Japanese War and World War I for major powers like Russia, Germany, Italy, and Great Britain, highlighting the devastating human cost. For historians, this article is interesting as it reflects a Korean perspective (published by the editorial office of a Korean magazine) during the height of Japanese colonial rule and World War II. The framing of conflicts like the \"China Incident\" and the detailed focus on casualty statistics from recent major wars (including Japan's war with Russia) reveal an awareness of, and perhaps preoccupation with, the brutal realities of modern, industrialized warfare, even as Korea itself was mobilized for Japan's war effort.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n支那事變\t지나 사변\tChina Incident (Second Sino-Japanese War)\n第二次歐洲大戰\t제이차 구주 대전\tSecond European Great War (WWII)\n希臘\t희랍\tGreece\n歐洲\t구주\tEurope\n소로깅\t소로깅\tSorokin\n오스토리아\t오스트리아\tAustria\n英國\t영국\tGreat Britain\n佛蘭西\t불란서\tFrance\n露西亞\t노서아\tRussia\n伊太利\t이태리\tItaly\n獨逸\t독일\tGermany\n和蘭\t화란\tNetherlands\n西班牙\t서반아\tSpain\n波蘭\t파란\tPoland\n日露戰役\t일로 전역\tRusso-Japanese War\n潦陽\t요양\tLiaoyang\n奉天\t봉천\tFengtian (Mukden)\n日本海戰\t일본 해전\tBattle of the Japan Sea (Battle of Tsushima)\n世界大戰\t세계 대전\tWorld War\n\n**Glossary**\n\n威力\t위력\tPower, might, force\n加速度的\t가속도적\tAccelerating, exponential\n支那事變\t지나사변\tChina Incident (term for the Second Sino-Japanese War)\n緊要한\t긴요한\tCrucial, essential\n授護的\t수호적\tProtective, covering (likely from 守護)\n殲滅的\t섬멸적\tAnnihilating, exterminating\n사상자\t사상자\tCasualties (killed and wounded)\n激戰\t격전\tFierce battle\n社會學者\t사회학자\tSociologist\n當該國\t당해국\tThe country concerned, the respective country\n除하면\t제하면\tIf divided by\n死傷負擔示數\t사상부담지수\tCasualty Burden Index\n傭兵\t용병\tMercenary\n算入한\t산입한\tIncluded in the calculation\n戰役\t전역\tWar, campaign, military expedition\n總動員\t총동원\tTotal mobilization\n알어보는\t알아보는\tTo find out, to investigate (older spelling of 알아보다)\n지내지 안었는데\t지내지 않았는데\tDid not exceed (older spelling/grammar for 지내지 않았는데)\n내이고 있다\t내고 있다\tIs presenting, is putting forth (older grammatical form of 내고 있다)\n當하고 있다\t당하고 있다\tAmounts to, corresponds to (here meaning 'constitutes X percent')\n되여있다\t되어 있다\tAmounts to, has become (older spelling of 되어 있다)\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n잡지명\t삼천리 제14권 제1호\n발행일\t1942년 01월 01일\n기사제목\t海外消息, 戰爭과 死傷數\n필자\t編輯室\n기사형태\t소식\n\n海外消息, 戰爭과 死傷數\n\t\t\t\t\t\t編輯室\n무기의 발달과 함께 전쟁에 있어서 파괴의 威力은 加速度的으로 증대한다.\n현재의 支那事變及 祭二次歐洲大戰에 있어서 얼마나한 병력의 損失이 있는가를 알어보는 것은 가장 緊要한 문제인데 지금도 전쟁이 계속 중이므로 좀 困難하다.\n현재는 戰車, 飛行機, 大砲의 授護的 전투가 아니고는 보병은 敵地를 점령할 수가 없는 것이다. 따라서 거기에 받는 損害도 殲滅的 이다.\n希臘시대의 전쟁에는 사상자의 수는 激戰에 있어서 병력의 2-3%에 지내지 안었는데 歐洲大戰에는 병력의 38.9%에 이르렀다. 사회학자 소로깅은 오스토리아, 英國, 佛蘭西, 露西亞, 伊太利, 獨逸, 和蘭, 西班牙, 波蘭 歐洲 九個國에 대하여 別表와 같이 세기별 數字를 내이고 있다.\n\n다시 當該國의 인구수로 사상자수를 除하면 死傷負擔示數가 나온다. 인구 千人당 각국별 수는 다음 같다.＜96＞\n표는 外國傭兵을 算入한 것이다.\n더욱 日露戰役(1904年-1905年)에 있어서 露西亞 총동원 병력은 500,000인데 그중 사상자는 170,000으로 사상자는 병력의 34%(潦陽 11%, 奉天23%, 日本海戰 70%)에 當하고 있다.\n또 제1차 世界大戰에 있어서 총동원 병력은 獨逸이 13,000,000, 伊太利가 5,180,000, 露西亞가 15,500,000, 英國이 7,500,000인데 총 사상자수는 그럭저럭 6,060,000(四六.六%)  1,780,000(34.3%) 5,500,000(35%) 3,070,000(32.3%)나 되여있다.＜97＞\n＜96-97＞","magazine":"삼천리 제14권 제1호","date":"1942년 01월 01일","title":"Overseas News: War and Casualty Numbers"},{"path":"89_14.01_1942.01/170.txt","issue":"89_14.01_1942.01","content":"Sketch of Combined Fleet Commander-in-Chief, Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Hŭngasaeng\n\nIn the opening battles of the Greater East Asia War, the might of Our Imperial Navy's Air Corps, which pierced the heart of the United States and annihilated Britain's Pacific Fleet in the naval battle off Malaya, has etched a shining record in world military history. Consequently, the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet has once again graciously received an Imperial Rescript.\n\nWhile crushing the enemy's main strength, our main battleships remain unseen, like mere shadows. This leisurely and confident attitude seems to symbolize the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku (山本56大將). Admiral Yamamoto (山本提督), who has elicited admiration from the world and unending praise from the nation, prompting thoughts of the second coming of Fleet Admiral Tōgō (東鄕元師), where might he be now? On which sea, aboard which ship, is he receiving the second Imperial Rescript, unable to contain his deep emotion? When we consider the calm demeanor and resolute air of Admiral Yamamoto, whose whereabouts are unknown, a feeling of trust arises in our hearts.\n\nHowever, upon further reflection, just as the great achievements of Great Tōgō (大東鄕) were not solely due to the strength of Fleet Admiral Tōgō alone, the chorus of praise showered upon Admiral Yamamoto is not his alone.\n\nFrom the Washington Treaty to the London Treaty, the Empire's naval power was beneath that of Britain and America. Believing that the inferiority in material armaments had to be compensated for by spiritual training, the spirit of the entire navy, which endured training \"more arduous than naval battles\" with submarines and aircraft, has now found expression through Admiral Yamamoto.\n\nThe Battle of Hawai'i and the naval battle off Malaya were indeed splendid military achievements. Yet, Admiral Yamamoto is a silent and taciturn presence. He is not one to chatter boastfully to others. He possesses a demeanor that remains composed even if mountains crumble or floods strike.\n\nWhen discussing Admiral Yamamoto, there are two facts connected by a curious fate that come to mind.\n\nFirstly, in Taishō 10 (1921), he served as an advisor to the plenipotentiary (全權輔佐役) with the rank of Commander (中佐) at the Washington Conference. In Shōwa 5 (1930), he worked as a technical expert (専門委員) at the London Conference. And in Shōwa 9 (1934), at the London Naval Disarmament Preparatory Conference (倫敦軍縮豫備會議), he acted as the Empire's Plenipotentiary (帝國全權), smashing that conference which sought to further place the Japanese navy in an inferior position, and returned. It was during that time. Admiral Yamamoto suddenly proposed the abolition of aircraft carriers. This was a proposal Britain and America were unlikely to accept. Indeed, the American representative, Davis (떼비스), said,\n\"It is extremely unexpected that you, the authority on the Japanese Naval Air Corps (日本海軍航空隊), would make such a proposal.\" <100>\n\"That is precisely why I advocate for it. Having experienced command of a squadron (戰隊司令), I know well what a cruel role the aircraft carrier plays. I advocate this for the sake of humanity.\"\nAdmiral Yamamoto's reply could not be comprehended. Thus, this conference failed to reach an agreement. What if America had agreed to the abolition of aircraft carriers? They would not have seen the crushing defeat at the Battle of Hawai'i.\n\nThere is a reason why Admiral Yamamoto was called \"the authority on the Japanese Naval Air Corps\" by Davis. Looking at his career, he gained experience directly training the \"Sea Eagles\" (海鷲) as the Head Instructor (敎頭) at the Kasumigaura Air Group (霞浦航空隊), served as the Director of the Technical Department (技術部長) of the Naval Aeronautics Department, Commander of the First Carrier Division (第一航空戰隊 司令), and Chief of the Naval Aeronautics Department (航空本部長). He nurtured our great naval air corps, having worked on both the operational and administrative sides. He is, so to speak, the father of the Sea Eagles. That man has now become the father of the entire Imperial Navy. Considering that the opening battles of the current operation were entirely achievements resulting from the activities of the naval air corps, one cannot help but feel exhilaration at the paradoxical effect that the Imperial Navy has, in fact, become stronger thanks to naval disarmament (軍縮).\n\nIt will be an extremely arduous task for the navy under Admiral Yamamoto (山本提督) to maintain the brilliant results of the opening battles until the end of the war. The enemy, with the tenacious persistence characteristic of the Anglo-Saxons, could easily resort to prolonged guerrilla warfare.\n\nHowever, we must place our trust in that Admiral Yamamoto, and consequently, have absolute confidence in the certain victory and strenuous efforts of the entire navy. <101>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis 1942 article from the Korean magazine *Samch'ŏlli* is a biographical sketch praising Japanese Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, following the early victories at Pearl Harbor and off Malaya. Written by \"Hŭngasaeng\" (Student of Prosperous Asia), it portrays Yamamoto as a stoic, brilliant strategist, the \"father\" of Japan's naval aviation, who cleverly navigated naval disarmament treaties to ultimately strengthen Japan's forces. The piece emphasizes the spiritual strength of the Japanese Navy and expresses absolute confidence in final victory under Yamamoto's leadership, framing the early successes as just the beginning. For historians, this article is a significant example of Japanese wartime propaganda disseminated in colonial Korea, showcasing the attempt to rally Korean support (or at least acquiescence) for Japan's war effort by lionizing Japanese military figures and promoting the narrative of Japanese naval superiority and inevitable victory in the \"Greater East Asia War.\" The author's pen name itself is indicative of the era's ideology.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n聯合艦隊司令長官 山本五六 大將\t연합함대 사령장관 야마모토 이소로쿠 대장\tCommander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku\n山本五六\t야마모토 이소로쿠\tYamamoto Isoroku\n興亞生\t흥아생\tHŭngasaeng\n米國\t미국\tUnited States (America)\n英國\t영국\tBritain (England)\n太平洋艦隊\t태평양함대\tPacific Fleet\n我海軍航空隊\t아 해군 항공대\tOur Imperial Navy's Air Corps\n聯合艦隊\t연합함대\tCombined Fleet\n山本提督\t야마모토 제독\tAdmiral Yamamoto\n東鄕元師\t도고 원수\tFleet Admiral Tōgō (Referring to Tōgō Heihachirō)\n大東鄕\t대동향\tGreat Tōgō\n와싱톤\t워싱턴\tWashington\n론돈\t런던\tLondon\n帝國\t제국\tEmpire (Referring to the Empire of Japan)\n하와이\t하와이\tHawai'i\n마레-\t말레이\tMalaya\n떼비스\t데이비스\tDavis\n日本海軍航空隊\t일본 해군 항공대\tJapanese Naval Air Corps\n霞浦航空隊\t가스미가우라 항공대\tKasumigaura Air Group\n第一航空戰隊\t제1 항공 전대\tFirst Carrier Division (lit.

What kind of wartime training are you providing for all female students at your school?\n2. What is your opinion on providing military training to female students?\n3. What kind of contemporary reading materials and films are female students recently engaging with?\n\nPutting Full Effort into Instilling the Group-Based National Concept\nTŏksŏng Girls' Commercial School Principal Fukuzawa Reiko (Song Kŭmsŏn)\n\n1. Methods likely vary depending on school circumstances, but at our school, we have deeply considered health, which is crucial for national life in wartime. As a result of focusing on students' physical training, we haven't had any instances of students dropping out mid-term due to illness or causing any accidents. Accordingly, this winter too, in the sense of training students for low-temperature living, we plan to use heaters as little as possible, adjusting based on the degree of cold air. Thus, we utilize the time between classes to rigorously conduct physical training drills for all students.\n\n2. It is absolutely necessary.\nPhysiologically, there might be distinctions between men and women, but this is not a time when the country can entrust all matters solely to men while women idly focus only on sleeping and eating. Therefore, I feel the absolute necessity of military training for women as well. Although the results are still meager, our school is currently providing military training to all students. Especially for female students growing up in Chosŏn homes, it is necessary for instilling an awareness of the group-based national concept (國體的 國家觀念) now that the nation is in an emergency. Furthermore, I wish to thoroughly implement training through female students in Chosŏn households that still lack experience in wartime life.\n\n3. Since every school strictly monitors films and books to ensure a healthy spiritual life, students watch films designated by the Press Alliance (報導聯盟). As for books, it likely differs by school. At our school, we try to recommend books related to the current situation (時局) to female students as much as possible, but it's not yet thorough. For upper-level classes, we have them read newspapers daily, at least within the school, to cultivate the habit. <102>\n\nCurrent Situation Lectures and Drill Implementation\nSangmyŏng Practical Girls' School Principal Pae Sangmyŏng (Hōmura Shōmei)\n\n1. Of course, coursework is coursework, but training is also considered important. We encourage various sports competitions to strive for increased physical strength. We also have students grasp an accurate understanding of the current situation through air defense drills or, whenever opportunities arise, lectures on the current situation entrusted to societal figures or faculty members, so they become possessors of the passion and strength to bravely fight against all difficulties.\n\n2. I believe it is necessary.\nCurrently, our school conducts off-campus military training for all students every Saturday, and its effects are remarkably significant. As the times demand, strict and disciplined military training is absolutely necessary to cultivate bodies like iron and stone, steadfast spirits, and the strength of perfect order (一糸不亂) and perseverance through repeated failures (七倒八起).\n\n3. At school, extracurricular reading materials must receive permission from the homeroom teacher. Generally, it seems they read many biographies, such as those of heroes. Since movies are strictly forbidden, their tendencies cannot be known, but films related to the current situation, in particular, are shown to students as a group by the school. However, it seems they don't possess accurate critical judgment.\n\nMainly Air Defense Drills and Labor Service\nMyŏngsŏng Girls' School Principal Tsukimura Mizusaki\n\n1. Schools have always paid attention to physical training in parallel with academic instruction, conducting excursions, long-distance walks, or trips. Recently, in response to the current situation, we are mainly training students in air defense drills, labor service (勤勞作業), first aid methods (救急手當法), methods for utilizing waste and scrap materials (廢物, 殘物), and repair methods (修繕法).\n\n2. Imposing military training on female students—I think its fundamental significance lies more in the spiritual aspect than the military one. Wouldn't it be more effective to provide practical training in various fields that women can handle? In other words, let's entrust military matters to men and provide practical training in areas women can capably handle, such as air defense or relief work (救護).\n\n3. Originally, the critical judgment of students, especially young female students, cannot be trusted, so students' entry into movie theaters is strictly prohibited. Only when there is a film deemed educationally beneficial are students permitted to attend under teacher supervision. Strict monitoring is also applied to the selection of novels. Recently, films shown include \"The Life of General Nogi\" (「乃木大將の 生涯」), \"Stone by the Roadside\" (「路傍の石」), and \"You and I\" (「君と僕」). The novels generally read most by students seem to be Mr. Tsurumi's \"Mother\" (「母」) and Ms. Yoshiya Nobuko's \"Friendship\" (「友情」). There's not much in the way of critique; it's just uniform emotion. <103>\n\nSchool Alliance Labor\nSŏngsin Chongjŏng Girls' School Principal Yi Sukchong\n\n1.\n1. Tuesday weekly formation marching assembly\n2. Monthly air defense drill (1 time)\n3. School Alliance Labor Corps (學敎聯盟作業隊) training\n   a. Regular work\n   b. Beautification work\n4. Daily implementation of strengthening exercise time\n   30 minutes of rhythmic walking (正條步) training\n5. Recycled goods exhibition\n   Implemented monthly on Patriotism Day (愛國日)\n\n2.\nApproval/Disapproval of Drill Training for Female Students\nOf course, I approve. Rather than forceful training, I consider it a duty appropriate to the current situation for polishing mind and body (心身硏磨).\n\n3.\nThere is no time to read anything other than reference books necessary for school materials. However, recently, it seems they read many tales of military virtue (軍國美談). Also, it seems they read \"Shufu no Tomo\" (主婦之友 - Housewife's Friend) a lot. As for movies, they do not watch anything other than educational films designated by the school. Regarding criticism of books and movies, speaking from hope, I wish the children nowadays would read books demanding scientific knowledge (科學的 智識).\n\nMilitary Training is Approved\nTŏkhwa Yŏsuk Principal Chŏngha Intŏk (Pak Intŏk)\n\n1. As this Yŏsuk (女塾 - women's private school) is a place that teaches domestic arts exclusively (家道專修), we particularly have general students learn and practice with a spirit connecting the entire household life to the war. For example, during special cooking classes (料理特間), we have them research and practice making food that costs less but has nutritional value (榮養價値), looks good, and tastes good.\n\n2. I approve of providing military training to female students as well. This is because military training enables group action, orderly living (秩序的 生活), physical training (身體鍛練), and the like.\n\n3. Students of this Yŏsuk recently read many books related to spiritual cultivation (精神修養). Next, they also read books concerning the war. For movies, they only watch those designated by this Yŏsuk. Some time ago, all Yŏsuk students went to see \"You and I\" (「君と僕」).\n\nCultivating an Indomitable Spirit\nIhwa Women's College Principal Ch'ŏnsŏng Hwallan (Kim Hwallan)\n\nAnswer to Question 1\nFrom a woman's standpoint, what is necessary for the decisive battle footing (決戰體制) <104> is being taught straightforwardly (直摯하게). And we intend to teach whatever is needed. We are instilling an indomitable spirit (不撓不屈) while providing training in perseverance and discipline (忍苦鍛練).\n\nAnswer to Question 2\nWe are implementing it now. We view it as necessary.\n\nAnswer to Question 3\nThey are things suitable for the decisive battle footing. End.\n\nBiographies of Great People and Low-Temperature Living\nKyŏngsŏng Kajeong Yŏsuk Principal Hwang Sintŏk\n\n1. To thoroughly train mind and body (心身의 鍛練), we are encouraging walking excursions (徒步遠足), air defense drills, low-temperature living (低溫生活), and the like.\n\n2. If the time has come when even women must go to the front (出征), that would be a separate issue, but generally speaking, it is difficult to approve of military training for female students. Unless there is some other method (方途) to prevent physiological problems (生理的 故障)—\n\n3. As we only have students up to the second year who are still young, we only circulate biographies of great people (偉人傳記) and 2 or 3 monthly magazines (月刊雜誌). As for movies, they are not shown anything other than those designated by the school. <105>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis 1942 survey article from the magazine *Samch'ŏlli* gathers opinions from principals of prominent Korean girls' schools on wartime training, particularly military drills, for female students. Responses vary: some principals strongly advocate for military training to instill national spirit and discipline (Song Kŭmsŏn, Pae Sangmyŏng, Yi Sukchong, Pak Intŏk, Kim Hwallan), seeing it as essential for the \"decisive battle footing\" and fostering a \"group-based national concept.\" Others express reservations, citing physiological concerns or preferring practical training more suited to women's perceived roles, such as air defense, first aid, labor service, and domestic skills adapted for wartime (Tsukimura Mizusaki, Hwang Sintŏk). The article also reveals strict control over students' reading and movie consumption, directing them towards state-approved materials like current affairs books, tales of military virtue, and designated films, while restricting access to general novels and entertainment.\nHistorically, this article is significant as it illustrates the extent of Japan's wartime mobilization efforts penetrating Korean colonial society, attempting to indoctrinate and utilize even young women for the war effort. The use of Japanese aliases by several Korean principals highlights the pressures and dynamics of collaboration/co-option within the colonial education system. The differing opinions among educators, balancing nationalistic fervor with practical concerns or traditional views on gender roles, offer a glimpse into the complex responses to imposed wartime demands within colonial Korea.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n德成女子實業學校\t덕성여자실업학교\tTŏksŏng Girls' Commercial School\n福澤玲子\t후쿠자와 레이코\tFukuzawa Reiko\n宋今璇\t송금선\tSong Kŭmsŏn\n朝鮮\t조선\tChosŏn\n報導聯盟\t보도연맹\tPress Alliance (Podoyŏnmaeng)\n祥明實踐女學校\t상명실천여학교\tSangmyŏng Practical Girls' School\n裵祥明\t배상명\tPae Sangmyŏng\n芳村祥明\t호무라 쇼메이\tHōmura Shōmei\n明星女學校\t명성여학교\tMyŏngsŏng Girls' School\n月村水先\t쓰키무라 미즈사키\tTsukimura Mizusaki\n乃木大將\t노기 대장\tGeneral Nogi\n路傍の石\t노방의 돌\tRobō no Ishi (Stone by the Roadside)\n君と僕\t너와 나\tKimi to Boku (You and I)\n鶴見\t쓰루미\tTsurumi\n母\t어머니\tHaha (Mother)\n吉屋信子\t요시야 노부코\tYoshiya Nobuko\n友情\t우정\tYūjō (Friendship)\n誠信宗政女學校\t성신종정여학교\tSŏngsin Chongjŏng Girls' School\n李淑鐘\t이숙종\tYi Sukchong\n學敎聯盟\t학교연맹\tSchool Alliance (Hakkyoyŏnmaeng)\n主婦之友\t주부지우\tShufu no Tomo (Housewife's Friend)\n德和女塾\t덕화여숙\tTŏkhwa Yŏsuk\n氶河仁德\t승하인덕\tChŏngha Intŏk\n朴仁德\t박인덕\tPak Intŏk\n梨花女子 專門學校\t이화여자전문학교\tIhwa Women's College\n天城活蘭\t아마기 카쓰란\tAmagi Katsuran\n金活蘭\t김활란\tKim Hwallan\n京城家政女塾\t경성가정여숙\tKyŏngsŏng Kajeong Yŏsuk\n黃信德\t황신덕\tHwang Sintŏk\n\n**Glossary**\n\n我校\t아교\tOur school (using 我 'I/our' + 校 'school')\n女學生\t여학생\tFemale student\n軍事敎練\t군사교련\tMilitary training/drill\n設問\t설문\tSurvey question\n戰時\t전시\tWartime\n식키고\t시키고\tMake/have (someone) do (older spelling of 시키고)\n있읍니까\t있습니까\tIs there? / Are you?

國家觀念을 인식 식키는데 필요하거니와 아직까지 戰時生活에 경험이 없는 朝鮮 家庭에 여학생을 통하여 훈련을 徹庭히 식키고 십습니다.\n3, 어떤 학교나 건전한 정신생활을 시키기 위하여 映畵나 書籍을 엄중히 감시하므로 영화는 報導聯盟의 指定영화를 보게 되었고 書籍은 학교에 따라 다르겠지만은요. 우리 학교에서는 될 수 있는 대로 여학생들에게 時局에 관한 書籍을 권합니다 마는 아직 철저치 못합니다. 상급반에 한해서는 교내에서 만이라도 습관을 주기 위하여 신문을 매일 읽힘니다. ＜102＞\n\n時局講話와 敎練實施\n祥明實踐女學校長 裵祥明(芳村祥明)\n\n1. 물론 학과도 학과이겠지만 訓練 亦 중요시하고 있읍니다. 각종 운동경기를 장려하여 체력의 증강을 힘쓰며 防空訓練 혹은 기회 있는 대로 社會名士나 敎職員에 依託하여 時局講話 등을 하여 정확히 時局認識을 파악하여 모-든 곤란과 능히 싸울 만한 열과 힘의 소유자가 되도록 힘쓰고 있읍니다.\n2. 필요하다고 생각합니다.\n현재 우리 학교에서는 매주 토요일 전교생에 교외 군사훈련을 실시하고 있읍니다만 그 효과는 判異하게 큼니다. 때가 때인 만큼 鐵石같은 몸, 굳세인 정신, 一糸不亂 七倒八起의 힘을 기르랴면 嚴格하고 規律적인 軍事敎練이 절대 필요하다고 생각합니다.\n3. 학교에서는 課外讀物은 반듯이 擔任先生의 허가를 얻도록 합니다. 대략 보면 英雄傳등의 傳記를 많이 보는 것 같고 영화는 절대로 금하기 때문에 그 傾向을 알 수 없으나 특히 時局映畵등은 학교에서 단체로 보힘니다만 정확한 批評力을 가지고 있지 못한 것 같드군요.\n\n주로 防空訓練과 勤勞工作\n明星女學校長 月村水先\n\n1. 학교에서는 항시 學科敎授와 並行的으로 체력단련에도 유의하게 되여 遠足, 長距離步行, 또는 旅行 같은 것을 하여왔는데 근래에 와서는 時局에 順應하야 주로 防空訓練, 勤勞作業, 救急手當法, 廢物, 殘物등 이용법, 修繕法 등을 훈련시키고 있읍니다.\n2. 여학생들에게 軍事訓練을 課한다는 것은 그 근본의의가 軍事的인 점보다도 精神的인 점에 있다고 생각되는데 그보다 여성으로서 감당할 수 있는 각 부문의 實務訓練을 시키는 것이 더 효과적이 아닐까요. 다시 말하면 軍事的인 것은 남성들에게 막기고 防空이라든가 救護라든가 여성의 힘으로 능히 감당할 부문이 實務訓練을 시키자는 말슴입니다.\n3. 원래 학생, 더구나 어린 여학생들의 批評力이란 信賴할 수 없기 때문에 학생의 영화관 출입은 嚴禁하고 간혹 교육상 유익하다고 인정되는 영화가 있을 때에만 先生引率下에 학생의 영화참관을 허락하며 小說 같은 것도 그 선택에 대하야 엄격한 감시를 하게 되는데 최근 영화로는 「乃木大將의 生涯」 「路傍の石」 「君と僕」등을 보였고 一般生들이 주로 많이 보는 소설은 鶴見氏의 「母」, 吉屋信子氏의 「友情」등을 많이 읽는 모양인데 뭐 批評이랄게 없고 그저

여학생들에게도 軍事敎練을 시키는 것을 찬성합니다. 軍事敎練을 함으로 團體行動, 秩序的 生活, 身體鍛練등을 할 수 있는 까닭입니다.\n3. 본 女塾生들은 근래 주로 정신수양에 관한 서적을 많이 읽습니다. 다음으로 전쟁의 관한 책도 읽읍니다. 영화는 本塾에서 지정하는 것이 아니면 안봅니다. 얼마 전에 「君と僕」을 全塾生이 보고 왔읍니다.\n\n不撓不屈의

And, how much is spent on children's education costs?\n\nMs. Nam Wŏnboksil, wife of Mr. Tokko Sŏn\nMonthly income is 150 Wŏn. With this money, spending is roughly as follows:\n1. About 70 Wŏn for clothing, food, and housing.\n1. About 15 Wŏn is spent on government bonds, savings, taxes, etc.\n1. 45 Wŏn for children's education costs.\n1.

Other: 3 Wŏn 19 Chŏn.\nTotal: 115 Wŏn 25 Chŏn\nShortfall: 1 Wŏn 77 Chŏn\n\nMs. Kim Hŭisin, wife of Mr. Pak Hŭido\nAnswering your question is very difficult as there is no fixed income. However, if I calculate based on what I receive whenever money needs to be spent, it comes to about 300 Wŏn a month. We manage to live somehow on 300 Wŏn, but these days, given the times, we are focusing on saving rather than spending.\n\nChŏn Hŭibok\nAfter living in dormitories for 8 years and boarding houses for 4 years, just paying a fixed meal fee, setting up my own home and trying to manage a household costs so much money that it's worrying. It hasn't even been half a year since setting up house, so expenditures don't follow a planned budget. I need to study and try harder, but I will answer based on last month's (November) household account book.\n1. Monthly income is 130 Wŏn.\n1. Approximate expenditures:\n1. Clothing expenses: We decided not to make new clothes for the time being, so it wasn't even in the budget.\nFood: Rice cost = 18 Wŏn 60 Chŏn (1 sack/叺). Side dish cost = average 1 Wŏn per day, and what's left over from the 1 Wŏn is put aside in a deposit box (預金箱). When guests come, we use that to supplement.\nHousing expenses: Father bought us a small house as a wedding gift, so there's no rent. Thinking of it as rent, I deposit 30 Wŏn.\nWater = about 1 Wŏn 50 Chŏn.\nElectricity = about 3 Wŏn. <107>\nGas (ヲチす - *ochi*, likely refers to city gas) = 75 Chŏn.\n2. Savings: Postal life insurance (簡易保險) 3 Wŏn.\nFor housing expenses 30 Wŏn.\nGovernment bonds: I plan to purchase as much as possible according to my salary from the government office (役所).\nTaxes: Father bears the burden.\n3. Children's education costs: Not needed yet.\n4. Books: I read many books like \"Fujin no Tomo\" (婦人之友), \"Ryokki\" (綠旗), \"Shōjo Club\" (少女俱樂部), and others in the field of chemistry.\nMovies: I go about three times a month on average (by myself).\nTheater: I rarely go. (Since children's education costs are not needed, I budget about 10 Wŏn quite generously for cultural aspects like books and movies.)\nBesides this, fuel costs, maid's pay (食母) 10 Wŏn, social expenses, etc., somehow the entire income gets spent. The foundation for living is not yet established, and many household items are still lacking, so it's impossible to live according to a fixed budget.\n\nMs. Pak Sŏngbae, wife of Mr. So Wankyu\n1. I don't know my husband's monthly income well; I receive about 200 Wŏn from my husband each month.\n2. It's quite embarrassing to say, but our house doesn't have any kind of household account book; we just spend as we go. That doesn't mean we don't economize. Lately, my husband told me to buy government bonds (國債) every month, so I cut down on household expenses and always buy 30 or 40 Wŏn worth of bonds with the remainder. Regarding the details of your questions 1, 2, 3, 4, I will definitely record them starting next time and send them.\n\nMs. Kang Poksin, wife of Mr. Son Kijŏng\n(Previous text omitted) I gratefully received the notice about our family's wartime household account book survey sent by your company today. Thank you for sending it even to our home, which has nothing particularly noteworthy for reference. Roughly writing it down:\nIn the 15th year (1940), income and expenditure were based on 2 salaries and a 2-person family. This year, the 16th year (1941), it's 1 salary for a 5-person family. Perhaps this might be of reference, so I am writing it on a separate sheet, please forgive me.\nExpenditures for the 16th year (1941) are covered by the income from the 15th year (1940), so it's a joint expenditure for two people. How will things be managed next year, the 17th year (1942)? That is all.\nShōwa 15 (1940), April <108>\n2 Salaries, 2-Person Family\nIncome: 182 Wŏn, Savings 50 Wŏn, Rice cost 10 Wŏn, Book cost 10 Wŏn, Newspaper cost 2 Wŏn 20 Chŏn, Postage stamps 4 Wŏn, Transportation cost 10 Wŏn, Travel expenses (including hiking) 20 Wŏn, Eating out (including movies) 8 Wŏn, Guest reception cost 15 Wŏn, Laundry cost 3 Wŏn, Electricity cost 1 Wŏn 40 Chŏn, Miscellaneous expenses (including side dishes) 30 Wŏn.\nShōwa 16 (1941), April\n1 Salary, 5-Person Family\nIncome: 100 Wŏn, Savings 18 Wŏn, Rice cost 30 Wŏn, Book cost 5 Wŏn, Newspaper cost 1 Wŏn, Stamp cost 1 Wŏn, Transportation cost 4 Wŏn, Travel/hiking 5 Wŏn, Miscellaneous expenses (including side dishes and guest reception) 30 Wŏn, Movies twice a month, Eating out stopped.\n\nMs. Cho Kyusun, wife of Mr. Pak Sinsik\n1. My husband's monthly income is about 500 Wŏn, but out of that, I receive exactly 300 Wŏn related to social connections every month.\n1. The expenditure summary for the above is as follows:\n1. For clothing, since we haven't had new clothes made recently, it's about 10 Wŏn per month on average for buying children's underwear and laundry costs. For 8 family members, food expenses are 90 Wŏn, fuel costs 30 Wŏn, and housing expenses 50 Wŏn.\n2. Industrial promotion savings (殖産積金) 1,000 Wŏn [total accumulation?] 1,926 Wŏn 70 Chŏn, Children's savings (兒童貯金) 3,915 Wŏn, Patriotic savings (愛國貯金) 193 Wŏn, Life insurance reserve savings (生命保險準備貯金) 15 Wŏn per month, Various taxes and public levies (諸稅金, 公課金) average 30 Wŏn per month. Besides these, my husband sometimes buys government bonds directly at the company.\n3. Our eldest son commutes to school, costing about 5 Wŏn per month.\n4. The remaining approximately 25 Wŏn is used for books, newspapers, other entertainment, and social expenses.\n\nAnonymous Person\nOut of an income of 100 Wŏn\nExpenditures are as follows:\nClothing cost 5 Wŏn, Housing cost 10 Wŏn, Food 40 Wŏn, Government bonds twice a year at bonus time, Savings 10 Wŏn, Taxes 42 Wŏn 39 Chŏn per year, Children's education cost savings 8 Wŏn 1 Chŏn per month, Books 5 Wŏn, Movies more than twice a month.\n-End- <109>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis 1942 article from Samch'ŏlli magazine surveys several Korean households about their wartime finances. Respondents detail their monthly income (ranging from 100 to over 500 Wŏn) and expenditures on necessities like food, clothing, housing, fuel, as well as discretionary spending on education, entertainment, and social costs. A strong emphasis on saving and purchasing government bonds (公債), sometimes explicitly called \"patriotic savings\" (愛國貯金), is evident across different income levels, reflecting wartime mobilization efforts. Some respondents note difficulties in budgeting due to changing circumstances (like starting a household or reduced income) and the general austerity of the times. For historians, this article offers a valuable glimpse into the socio-economic diversity of urban Korean households during the late colonial period, the tangible impact of wartime economic policies (forced savings, bond purchases), and individual strategies for coping with financial pressures under Japanese rule.

Although a girl, she excelled in all kinds of martial arts (武藝百般). When soldiers from Beifan (北蕃) invaded the northern border, shattering the peaceful dreams of the Tang Court, she went off to war as a young soldier in place of her elderly father. She became acquainted with a valiant and heroic young man named Liu Yuandu (劉元度), and the two formed a close friendship (親友). In the war, Mulan achieved many military exploits (武勳) and came to be respected as Captain Hua.\n\nLater, unexpectedly learning of the enemy's treacherous plot, Mulan and Liu Yuandu resolved themselves and rushed into enemy territory. Liu found Mulan, disguised as a local woman, very lovely. After spying (偵探) on the enemy's situation <106> and returning to their own fortress, it was already too late; the fortress was besieged by a large enemy force. However, thanks to Mulan's clever plan (寄畧), they succeeded in repelling the enemy troops and annihilating them. Thus, the era of Tang was once again enveloped in peace. On the day of the triumphant return (凱旋), beside Liu Yuandu stood a smiling, lovely, and beautiful woman – she was his comrade-in-arms, Captain Hua, that is, Mulan.\n\nThis is based on a Tang dynasty legend, filming the story of the famous beauty Hua Mulan who disguised herself as a man. It is known as a signature piece (得意의 狂言) of the famous stage actor Mei Lanfang. It is a work produced by Zhang Shankun (張善琨), the greatest producer the current Chinese film (支那映畵界) world possesses, and directed by Bu Wancang (卜萬蒼), one of the leading directors in the Shanghai film world, who has filmed several works starring Chen Yunshang (陳雲裳).\n\nWhat deserves special mention in this work is Chen Yunshang, who plays the lead role of Mulan. She is the biggest popular actress to appear like a comet (慧星) in the Chinese film world after the recent Incident (事變). Raised as the daughter of Overseas Chinese (華僑) in South China (南支), she entered the Hong Kong (香港) film world. With the Incident, Zhang Shankun, who had started film production in Hong Kong, recognized her talent <107> and she was suddenly selected (拔擢) as the heroine for \"Mulan Joins the Army.\" Her rarely seen beauty and striking personality fully provide her with the presence (貫祿) of a major star in any country in the world. And the person playing her counterpart, Liu, is Mei Xi (梅憙), renowned as a representative Chinese actor. <108>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe article introduces the Chinese film \"Mulan Joins the Army\" (木蘭從軍) to Korean audiences in 1942. It outlines the plot, based on the Tang dynasty legend of Hua Mulan, a young woman who disguises herself as a man to take her father's place in the army, achieves military success, and eventually reveals her identity. The article highlights the film's producer Zhang Shankun, director Bu Wancang, and particularly praises the lead actress Chen Yunshang for her beauty and star quality, mentioning her discovery in Hong Kong and rise to fame. The supporting actor Mei Xi is also noted. From a historical perspective, the article is interesting as it showcases the circulation and positive reception of Chinese popular culture (film) within colonial Korea during the height of the Sino-Japanese War and Japanese colonial rule. It demonstrates ongoing cultural connections and awareness despite the political situation, and the use of the term \"Shina\" (支那) reflects the period's geopolitical language.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n唐\t당\tTang\n花木蘭\t화목란\tHua Mulan\n北蕃\t북번\tBeifan\n劉元度\t유원도\tLiu Yuandu\n梅蘭芳\t매란방\tMei Lanfang\n支那\t지나\tShina (China)\n張善琨\t장선곤\tZhang Shankun\n上海\t상해\tShanghai\n陳雲裳\t진운상\tChen Yunshang\n卜萬蒼\t복만창\tBu Wancang\n南支\t남지\tNanshi (South China)\n香港\t향항\tHong Kong\n梅憙\t매희\tMei Xi\n樂浪學人\t낙랑학인\tNangnang Hagin\n\n**Glossary**\n\n떠러저\t떨어져\tFar apart (older spelling of 떨어져)\n깨트렸을 때\t깨뜨렸을 때\tWhen (they) shattered/broke (older spelling of 깨뜨렸을 때)\n사괴임\t사귐\tFriendship/Association (older noun form of 사귀다)\n어여삐\t어여삐\tPrettily/Lovingly (Archaic/poetic adverb)\n푸로뜌-사-\t프로듀서\tProducer (Older phonetic transcription)\n갓추었다\t갖추었다\tWas equipped with/Possessed (older spelling of 갖추었다)\n되여\t되어\tBecoming/Being (older spelling of 되어)\n밧탁되였던\t발탁되었던\tWas selected/scouted (older spelling/form of 발탁되었던)\n병정\t병정\tSoldier (Somewhat archaic term)\n무훈\t무훈\tMilitary exploits/achievements\n전멸\t전멸\tAnnihilation/Wipe out\n히로인\t히로인\tHeroine (Loanword)\n관록\t관록\tDignity/Presence/Experience\n개성\t개성\tIndividuality/Personality\n주연\t주연\tLead role (in a performance)\n감독\t감독\tDirector (film, etc.)\n제작\t제작\tProduction/Manufacturing\n소식\t소식\tNews/Information\n문제작\t문제작\tA work attracting attention/A much-discussed piece (lit.

It's not just train station platforms; in Kyŏngsŏng, there are many places like streetcar stops and bus stops where you have to stand in line to board. You might feel resentful, wondering why you have to go through such a bothersome task just to get a ride, but I believe you all know that this is done because avoiding it would lead to even more troublesome and annoying situations. In other words, if too many people rushed towards the narrow ticket windows or streetcar/bus doors all at once, pushing and shoving each other, nobody would get in properly, people could get hurt, and it would take even more time. Therefore, although it might seem frustrating at first glance, standing in line and entering in order is comfortable, smooth, and comparatively faster. It's like pouring water into a narrow bottle; pouring it all at once with a gourd might seem faster, but using a funnel (깔뚝이) to pour slowly prevents spilling and is actually quicker. Whenever you need to put many different things into a small container or when many people need to pass through a small door, there must always be an order, a sequence. Therefore, lining up and boarding in order is necessary not just for trains, streetcars, or buses, but in any situation where it's needed – such order and sequence must exist. This order and sequence is called *chilssŏ* (질서 - order). Thus, this order is more necessary where hundreds of people gather than where only one or two gather, and even more necessary where tens of thousands gather than where hundreds gather. For example, as I mentioned earlier, if you go to Kyŏngsŏng Station <110> you see long lines formed with people standing tightly in two rows at each ticket window, but if you go to Kaesŏng Station, the enforcement demanding such strict lines is less severe. This is because fewer people board there than at Kyŏngsŏng Station, so one can board the train without such strict order. Also, if you go to a small rural station, you can board freely without lining up. Even within Kyŏngsŏng, lining up to board is only enforced at streetcar and bus stops where many people gather; at other places, there is no rule about forming lines.\n\nEveryone, you must have recently seen many water carrier yokes (물지게) with buckets lined up next to public water taps while walking on the streets. A few days ago, as I passed Kongdŏkchŏng on my way to Ahyŏn, I saw an incredibly large number of water buckets lined up next to a public tap. I counted them, and there were eighty-two pairs arranged side by side. The next morning, passing the same place, I counted again, and there were ninety-four pairs. That evening, there were even more, so I counted once more, and there were one hundred pairs. They increased in the morning, increased in the evening, constantly growing. Not only did the number increase, but initially, people just gathered around and took water as they arrived. As the number gradually increased, they started lining up and drawing water in order. As the number grew further, nearing one hundred, I saw one person standing guard, ensuring everyone was lining up properly. You could see that the order became increasingly strict as more people gathered. It's different now because of the rationing ticket system (전표제), but until just recently, if you passed by a rice shop, you would see countless people lined up, sometimes even with a policeman (순사) standing guard nearby. Also, nowadays at Kyŏngsŏng Station, who knows how long people wanting platform tickets wait, guarding their spots and lining up. What do such scenes signify? Just as order is needed when many people pass through a narrow door, order is also necessary for fairness when many people seek a small amount of goods.\n\nEveryone, when you walk on a quiet country road, there are no restrictions, but why, when walking on the main streets of Kyŏngsŏng, are there signs saying \"Keep Left\" (左側通行), and why do you get scolded by policemen if you don't keep left? Also, at intersections, why are there <111> electric signals with red, blue, and yellow lights, forcing you to stop for a while even when you're in a hurry? This is also establishing order so that many people using a limited, narrow road can walk smoothly and safely without bumping into each other. At first glance, you might complain that you can walk freely in the countryside but can't even walk as you please in Seoul, but thanks to this, you can live safely without getting hurt in the complex city.\n\nSimilarly, when only one family lives in a house, they can do things whenever and however they please, but when multiple families live in one house, order is also necessary. The reason why family systems with strict controls exist more in the East, where large families live together, than in the West, where simple families live, is this. Whether this control is rational or not certainly leaves much room for study, but could such a large family live even a single day lawlessly and disorderly? That would be utterly impossible. The spirit of *changyuyusŏ* (長幼有序 - order between elders and juniors) developing particularly in the East can also be seen as a result of these large families living together.\n\nWhere many people gather, candy sellers follow, but policemen inevitably increase their surveillance. This is to maintain order so that things remain peaceful where large crowds gather. If order is necessary even when people gather temporarily, it's even more indispensable for those who gather to live together for a long time, unlike those who gather briefly and disperse. Laws and order must be abundant for life to be possible. From this, morality develops, and where that morality needs to be enforced, even by compulsion, it is codified into law to maintain order.\n\nSince this world is not a place where only one or two people gather, but where many people live together, wherever you go, you must live within this order. If someone temporarily seeks freedom by ignoring and disrupting this order, they are like someone kicking down a fence put up to prevent falling off a cliff because it feels confining (각갑하다고), only to fall off that cliff. We should rather be grateful for the order and laws built up over generations from the experiences of many people, and it is our duty to constantly study and correct any deficiencies.\n\nSo far, I have spoken about the necessity of order because many people live together, <112> but if one wants to live their own life valuably, order must certainly exist in one's personal life as well. Just as people must line up in order to enter through a narrow door, and just as people line up at shops to buy scarce goods, our lifespan is short, and there are countless things we want to do. Therefore, order must be established in everything to manage it all. First, we need order in how we use time. When we think of each ticking minute and second as a precious fragment of our life, we must contemplate how to spend this precious fragment meaningfully. Spending it preciously doesn't mean just doing anything that comes to mind without idling; it means thinking carefully about what is most effective during certain times – what to do during long periods, what during short periods, what while waiting – planning in advance, and executing accordingly. It's like a skilled tailor (말음질 잘 하는 사람) who can cleverly arrange and cut even a small piece of fabric to make several garments, and even use the scraps (부스럭이 헝겁) to sew things like thimbles (골무), thus using the fabric more valuably than others. In contrast, an unskilled tailor might cut haphazardly based on guesswork (가위 나가기 짐작으로 썩썩 베이다가), failing to properly make even one item and rendering the remaining scraps useless. It is truly frightening how commonly one wastes time doing nothing significant if time is used thoughtlessly (주책없이). Another point to be careful about when using time is the issue of what to do when time is short but there are many things one wants to do. It is less detrimental to prioritize the most important and urgent tasks first, even if it means not getting to the remaining ones due to lack of time. This may sound easy, but if you don't pay attention and set priorities in advance, when faced with the situation, you can become flustered, mix up the order, end up doing unnecessary things, and fail to do the necessary ones. For instance, imagine a fire breaks out and you have only five minutes to retrieve everything you need. You must really think if you can grab the most urgent things first, in order. When a fire breaks out, the most urgent thing is human life. So, the first task is ensuring every family member <113> escapes the fire safely. Next, retrieving valuable items, second only to life, is the correct sequence. However, we hear surprisingly often about people dying while trying to save belongings, or losing valuables while preoccupied with trivial items (너주레한 물건). Therefore, especially in such urgent and busy times, having order not only prevents great loss but also allows us to accomplish valuable tasks even in small moments.\n\nAlso, having order in one's work doesn't mean dawdling or avoiding urgent tasks, but rather implies doing what needs to be done calmly (찬온히). For example, no matter how rushed you are, you must thread the needle (바눌) properly; you cannot tie the thread around the middle of the needle. Let me give an interesting example regarding having order in time. When I was in America (미국), I went for a drive outside the city, and every house had laundry hung out abundantly. I couldn't help but be surprised, wondering if Americans did so much laundry. Some time later, I drove through several residential areas again and saw no laundry hung out. I later found out that Westerners have specific days for laundry, so on laundry day, every house is full of laundry, and on other days, none is hung out. That is, Western households have a weekly schedule: Monday is laundry day, Tuesday is ironing (대림질) day, Wednesday is sewing (바누질) day, Thursday is shopping day, Friday is visiting acquaintances day, and Saturday is for major cleaning (대소제), changing sheets (홋니불), towels (세수수건), etc., putting the used items into the laundry hamper. In the evening, they either have family entertainment at home or go to concerts or theaters. Sunday is for church. Because households almost uniformly follow this order as if by agreement, work gets done remarkably well without hindrance. You might laugh, thinking that only students follow timetables, and housewives manage chores as they come, wondering how such a system is possible. However, because Americans have such set weekly routines, it never happens that, for example, laundry doesn't get done on laundry day because a guest arrived. In our homes, even if we've gone to the trouble of heating water (일것 물을 데이고) and prepared everything <114> for laundry, if a guest comes, we stop everything to entertain them, letting the water cool down. The guest, unaware, feels uneasy about causing trouble, and unless the host is welcoming a particularly dear and missed guest, it's difficult to greet them cheerfully. Thus, both parties feel uncomfortable (자미가 없어지고), the work gets delayed, and social interaction also suffers. Of course, even Westerners are human, not machines, so unavoidable visits might occur even on laundry day. However, the visitor understands they are intruding on laundry day and typically just conveys urgent matters briefly near the laundry area out of apology. The host, likewise, feels that just responding while working constitutes politeness without needing special hospitality. This saves time, keeps both parties comfortable, and prevents needless worries (부지럽는 걱정) like worrying about sewing while doing laundry, or about laundry or cleaning while sewing. On the designated day, one can focus mind and body solely on that task, avoiding living amidst a pile of worries. Furthermore, because there is order, sequence, and structure in everything, there is a distinction between prior and later commitments. If you have a prior appointment (선약) with someone at a certain time, you cannot break that first promise, no matter how much better an opportunity arises at the same time later. That is, the prior appointment is considered extremely important. Therefore, when making appointments, people always ask if there is a prior commitment, and if not, they trust that the appointment will be kept. If people made multiple commitments for the same time without regard for prior versus later ones (후약의 구별 없이), and then chose the best option just before the time, imagine the disruption (낭패) caused at the other places. If such disruptions caused by one person frequently occur, that society ultimately just wastes effort and time, becoming a society that has lost order. It inevitably becomes a society that cannot accomplish properly even one thing while an orderly society accomplishes many. We must also have order when using things. If you put only one set of clothes in a wardrobe (의장), it doesn't matter much how you put it in. But when you need to store many clothes, you must fold them neatly and stack them systematically (차국차국 새둘드려) so that many garments can fit well without wrinkling. If you just crumple them up and stuff them in (꿍져서 트러박어 넣는다면) because it's bothersome, <115> the next time you take them out to wear, they will be heavily creased and unwearable, and it will be truly difficult to know what is where. In short, even when putting clothes in a wardrobe, order is needed to store and retrieve many items properly.\n\nThere must also be order in how things are placed and kept in the house. Items should always be kept in their designated places. Also, large and small items, heavy and light items, must be in their proper places. Everyone would call it foolish if a lighter item underneath gets damaged because a heavier item was placed on top of it. However, losses incurred from placing things in the wrong spot are actually more common in other situations. If even one or two items are placed in the wrong containers – this in that container, that in this container – it's hard to keep track. When there are many such instances, even if I put them there myself, I forget and cannot find them. When I urgently need to use something, chaos (법석) ensues. In haste and anger, I might empty out every container, spread things out like a marketplace, and rummage through everything as if conducting a house search (가택수색하듯), sometimes finding it eventually, but often not. What is the result then? The purpose of keeping things (간직한다는 것) is to use them stylishly (뽄있게) and effectively (생색있게) when needed. Wasting so much time in urgency and still not finding it, ultimately using a substitute, borrowing from others, or buying it again – how wasteful and pitiful is that? It's even more foolish than crushing a light object by placing a heavy one on top. Therefore, even if I live alone with my own belongings, strict order is essential to use various items accurately within a short time. If memory alone is insufficient, it's okay to write things down. Taking inventory of all my current possessions and recording them might seem like useless extra work, but if this prevents greater wasted effort later, doing so is quite wise. Large stores always conduct inventory checks (在庫品 調査) once a month. While private households don't need such grand formalities, there should definitely be a time, perhaps once or twice a year during a less busy period, to organize one's possessions – checking what one has, what's missing, what's damaged, and what needs repair. It would be good to clearly <116> record these things for each container and location. Also, even for desks, drawers (설압), or kitchen cupboards used daily, if there are items not used frequently cluttering the space, causing things to be piled on top of each other in a rush, setting aside time once a week to reorganize them will take little time and allow you to retrieve needed items with confidence and peace of mind. Furthermore, by noting down items that are missing, used up, or damaged, you can take care of purchasing or repairs all at once when you go out, which is incredibly convenient. For example, suppose an umbrella rib breaks after use. Thinking, \"Well, I'm not going out today anyway,\" you just toss it aside (처박어 두었다가). After a day or two, you forget about it. When it rains and you try to open (페볼) the umbrella to use it, you finally discover the broken rib and remember you didn't fix it. You can't fix it immediately, and if you suddenly need to buy a new one, you end up paying more for something possibly inferior. This happens quite often with clothing and everyday tools. Therefore, taking about thirty minutes once a week, perhaps on a specific evening, to look around the house and check all frequently used (각금 쓰는) items will definitely pay off. It's actually quite an interesting (자미있는) task.\n\nFurthermore, when several family members live together, even if things are meticulously placed in their designated spots, another family member might unintentionally pick something up, use it, and then, not knowing where it should go back, leave it lying around somewhere else. When things start being put in the wrong places like this, items gradually get lost, leading to frustration and helplessness when needed. Therefore, in well-organized households, they might designate a large container and put anything there whose proper place is uncertain (몰를 것이 있으면). Then, if an item is missing from its spot, one can check that container, find it, and the owner can return it to its proper place. Some might criticize having too many rules among just a few family members, saying it reduces the warm (”°뜻한) feeling. However, treating such minor issues casually can easily lead to blushing faces, harsh words, and even damaged relationships. Therefore, this order can be compared to the discomfort and effort of getting a preventive vaccination to avoid a major illness.\n\nIn any case, let us, the new women (신녀성), advance towards a new life.\n(End) <117>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis 1942 editorial by Ko Hwang-gyŏng, head of Home Economics at Ewha Womans College, argues strongly for the importance of *chilssŏ* (order/discipline) in modern life. Using examples like queuing at stations, managing public water access, traffic rules, and contrasting Eastern large families with Western ones, she emphasizes that order is crucial for efficiency, safety, and fairness in society. Ko extends this principle to personal life, advocating for meticulous time management (with a detailed example of American housewives' weekly schedules), organized storage of belongings, and systematic household maintenance. The article specifically addresses women, urging them (\"new women\") to adopt these orderly practices as part of embracing a \"new life.\" From a colonial history perspective, the article's heavy emphasis on order, discipline, efficiency, and the \"new life\" aligns closely with the prevailing Japanese wartime rhetoric aimed at mobilizing the Korean populace and restructuring society according to perceived modern, rational (and often authoritarian) principles. The focus on regulating women's domestic sphere to achieve this order is particularly noteworthy for historians studying gender roles and social control during this period.\n\n**Named

안 하면 더 페롭고 귀찮은 일이 있기 때문에 그렇게 한다는 것을 다 아실 줄 압니다. 즉 말하자면 너무 여러 사람이 좁은 출찰구나 전차 뻐스문으로 왈칵 달려들어서 서로 떼여 밀치다가는 아모도 잘못 들어가고 사람만 상하고 시간도 더 걸릴 터이니까 얼른 생각하기는 각급스런 것 같지만 줄로 섰다가 차레차레 들어가면 편하게 순순히 들어가고도 비교적 속히 들어갈 수 있는 까닭입니다. 마치 좁은 병에 물을 넣으려면 박아지로 한꺼번에 왈칵 붓는 것이 속할 것 같애도 깔뚝이를 통해서 가만가만 붓는 것이 흘리지도 않고 오히려 속히 넣을 수 있는 것과 같은 것입니다. 적은 물건 속에 여러 가지를 많이 드려 보낼 때나 적은 문으로 여러 사람이 드나들려면 어느 때나 차례가 있어야만 하고 두서가 반듯이 있어야만 합니다. 그러니까 줄로 서서 차례로 탄다는 것은 기차나 전차나 뻐스뿐만 아니라 어느 경우를 물론하고 필요할 때는 다- 그런 차례와 두서가 있어야만 합니다. 그 차례와 두서라는 것을 질서라고 합니다. 그러면 이 질서라는 것은 한두 사람이 모일 때보다는 여러 백명 모인 곳에 더 필요한 것이며 여러 백명 모인 곳보다 여러 만명 모인 곳에 더욱 더욱 필요한 것입니다. 례를 들면 아까도 말슴드린 바와 같이 京城驛에＜110＞ 나가시면 出札口마다 두 줄로 꼭꼭 서서 긴-열을 짓고 있는 것을 보신다고 했지만 은 開城驛에를 가보면 京城驛처럼 엄하게 열을 지으라는 단속이 적습니다. 그것은 경성역보다 탈 사람이 적은 고로 그다지 엄한 질서가 없어도 차를 탈 수가 있고 또 조그마한 촌 정거장에를 가보면 줄로 서지 않어도 맘대로 들어갈 수 있게 되었읍니다. 또 같은 京城이라도 사람 많이 타는 전차 정유장이나 뻐스 정유장에서만 열을 지어 타게 되었지 그렇지 않은 곳에는 열을 짓는 법이 없읍니다.\n여러분, 요사이 길에 지나다니시다가 공동수도 옆에 물지게 통이 많이 줄로 늘어 노인 것을 보섰을줄 압니다. 몇일 전에 제가 공덕정을 지나서 아현으로 가는 길에 공동수도 옆에 너무도 물통이 끔직스럽게 많이 길게 늘어 놓였기에 세여 보았더니 쌍쌍히 놓인 것이 여든 두쌍 이였습니다. 그 다음날 아침에 같은 곳을 지나면서 또 세여 보았더니 아흔 네쌍이였습니다. 그 날 저녁에 더 많어젔기에 또 한번 세여 보았더니 백쌍이였습니다. 아침에 늘고 저녁에 늘고 자꾸 늡니다. 그냥 수효가 늘어가는 것만 아니라 처음에는 아무케나 둘러서서 닥치는 대로 물을 따러가는 사람이 따러가게 되였던 것이 차차 많어지니까 줄로 서서 차례로 물을 길었는데 차차 더 많어서 백에 가까운 수효가 되니까 한 사람이 꼭 서서 지키면서 똑바로 줄로 노았는가 단속하고 있는 것을 보았습니다. 사람이 많을수록 질서가 점점 엄하여 진다는 것을 볼 수가 있었습니다. 지금은 전표제가 되어서 안그치만 요 얼마 전까지 쌀가개 앞을 지나면 무수한 사람이 열을 지어 서 있고 어떤 때는 순사까지 곁에서 지키는 것을 보았습니다. 또 요사이 경성역에서 입장권 살 사람들이 얼마나 오래 전부터 와서 지키고 열을 지어 섰는지 모르겠습니다. 그런 것은 다 무엇을 표시하는 광경이겠습니까? 좁은 문으로 여러 사람이 들어갈 때에 질서가 있어야만 하는 것처럼 적은 물건을 여러 사람이 구할 때에는 공평하게 하기 위하여 질서가 또한 필요한 것입니다.\n여러분, 길을 가실 때라도 한적한 촌길로 다니면 아무런 구속이 없는데 왜 경성대로를 다니면 左側通行이라고 써 붙이고 左側通行을 안 하면 순사에게 잔말을 듣습니까. 또 네거리 길에서는 붉은 빛 푸른 빛 누른빛의＜111＞ 전등신호까지 있어서 급한 길로 못 가고 한참식 서있게야만 됩니까? 이것도 여러 사람이 한정 있는 좁은 길로 다니려니까 서로 이마를 부딧지 말고 순순히 맘놓고 잘 다니려고 질서를 차린 것입니다. 얼핏 생각하면 촌에서는 맘대로 다니는데 서울서는 걸음도 맘대로 못것는다고 불평일지 모르나 그래도 그 덕택에 복잡한 도회지에서 몸이 상치않고 잘 사는 것입니다.\n그와 마찬가지로 한 집에 한 식구만 살 때에는 아모 때나 아모케나 맘대로 할 수 있지만은 한집에 여러 식구가 살 때에는 또한 질서가 필요합니다. 간단한 가족이 살게 된 서양보다 대가족이 사는 동양에서는 가족제도의 엄한 통제가 있는 것도 그 까닭입니다. 그것이 합리적으로 통제가 되었느냐 아니 되었느냐 묻는다면 연구할 여지가 물론 많지만은 하여간 무법하게 무질서하게 그 많은 식구가 하루라도 살 수가 있느냐 하면 그것은 도저히 할 수가 없습니다. 동양에서 특별히 長幼有序의 정신이 발달된 것도 이 대가족이 함께 살게된 까닭이라고 볼 수가 있읍니다.\n사람 많이 모인 곳에는 엿장사도 딸아다니지만은 순사가 반듯이 더욱 감시를 합니다. 그것은 많은 사람이 몰리는 곳에 무사하도록 질서를 유지하려고 하는 까닭입니다. 사람이 일시적으로 많이 몰리기만 해도 질서가 필요한 것이라면 잠시 몰렸다가 헤여지는 것과도 달러서 오래 모여 살려면 법과 질서가 많지 않고는 살 수가 없읍니다. 거기에서 도덕이 발달되고 그 도덕을 일층 강제로라도 실행시킬 곳에는 법률화를 시켜서 질서를 유지하는 것입니다.\n이 세상이 한 두 사람 모인 곳이 아니요 여러 사람이 모여 사는 이상 어느 곳으로 가든지 이 질서 속에 반듯이 살어야 하는 것입니다. 일시적으로 자유스럽겠다고 이 질서를 무시하고 물란하게 하고 나가는 사람이 있다면 그 사람은 마치 낭떠러지에 떠러지지 말라고 울타리를 처 놓은 것을 각갑하다고 발길로 처버리기 때문에 그 낭떠러지로 떠러지게 되는 것과 마찬가집니다. 우리는 오히려 옛날부터 오래 동안 대대로 쌓인 여러 사람의 경험으로 된 그 질서와 법을 감사해야 되겠고 부족한 것은 늘 연구해서 고쳐 나가도록 하는 것이 도리이겠습니다.\n지금까지 말슴드린 것은 여러 사람이 사니까 질서가 필요하다고＜112＞ 했지만은 자기의 한 생전을 가치 있게 살어가려고 하면 자기 한 개인의 생활에도 질서가 반듯이 있어야 합니다. 적은 문으로 여러 사람이 들어가려니까 차례차례 줄로 서야만 하는 것처럼 또한 적은 물건을 여러 사람이 사려니까 상점에 사람들이 줄로 서서 사는 것처럼 우리 한 사람의 일생이라는 그 짧은 동안에 하고 싶은 것은 수없이 많기 때문에 모-든 것에 질서가 반듯이 서야만 감당할 수가 있는 것입니다. 먼저 우리는 시간 사용에 대하여 질서가 있어야 겠습니다. 똑딱 똑딱하고 지나가는 이 일분 일초가 우리의 귀한 일생의 한 토막이라고 생각할 때 어찌하면 이 귀한 토막을 귀하게 뜻있게 보낼 수 있을까 하고 연구해야 할 것입니다. 무엇이든지 닥치는 대로 놀지만 않고 하면 귀하게 보내는 것이 아니라 어떤 시간에는 무엇을 하는 것이 가장 효과가 있을가, 긴 시간에는 무엇을 하며 짧은 시간에는 무엇을 할가 기다리는 시간에는 무엇을 할까 하는 것을 잘 생각하여 미리미리 계획했다가 착착 맞혀가는 것이 시간을 귀하게 보내는 것이 됩니다. 마치 말음질을 잘 하는 사람은 적은 옷감 가지고도 요리조리 잘 주어맟우어 말러서 옷을 여러 개를 말르고도 부스럭이 헝겁으로 골무 같은 것까지 기워 남보다 더 가치있게 그 옷감을 쓸 수 있고 말음질이 서투른 사람은 가위 나가기 짐작으로 썩썩 베이다가 한 가지도 변변히 못 말으고 남은 헝겁조차 다른 곳에 쓸 수 없게 만드는 세음입니다. 주책없이 시간을 쓰다가는 별로 한 것도 없이 허송세월하게 되기가 예사인 고로 참으로 두려운 일입니다. 또 한가지 시간을 쓰는데 주의할 것은 무엇인고 하니 시간은 조금밖엊� 없는데 여러 가지 하고 싶은 때는 어떻게 할가 하는 문제입니다. 제일 중요하고 긴급한 것부터 차레 차레 먼저 하다가 시간 없으면 그 남어지는 못하게 되는 한이 있더라도 덜 손해가 되는 것입니다. 이것이 쉬운 것 같지만은 사실 정신차리고 미리미리 순서를 차려 놓지 않으면 막상 닥칠 때에는 당황해서 순서를 바꾸어 별로 필료치 않은 것은 하고 필료한 것은 못하고 마는 수가 많습합니다. 가령 말하면 불이 나서 오분 동안에 내게 필요한 것을 다- 끄내야만 할 때 정말 차레 차레 제일 급한 것부터 손에 잡힐가 생각을 해야 하겠습니다. 불이 날 때 제일 급한 것은 사람의 생명입니다. 그러면 무엇보다도 식구마다＜113＞ 다- 불에서 살어 나오도록 하는 것이 첫재 일이요. 그 다음에는 생명 다음으로 갈 귀한 물건을 꺼내는 것이 바른 순서이지만은 사실 물건 끄내려다가 사람 태우는 일이라든지 너주레한 물건에 매달려 귀중픔을 잃어버리는 일이 의외에도 너무 많다는 말을 듣습니다. 그러면 그러한 급하고 바뿐 때일수록 질서가 있어야 큰 손해가 없을 뿐만 아니라 우리의 하고저 하는 가치있는 일은 적은 틈을 타서라도 일우어 볼 수가 있읍니다.\n또 한가지 일에 질서가 있다고 하는 것은 급하다고 할 것을 안하고 어물적하는 것이 아니라 해야 할 것만은 찬온히 한다는 뜻이 있읍니다. 가령 말하면 아모리 급해도 바눌에 실을 끼어 써야지 바눌 허리에 실을 매여 쓰지는 못하는 것과 마찬가지입니다. 시간에 질서가 있게 한다는데 대하여 자미있는 예를 하나 들겠습니다. 제가 미국 있을 때에 자동차를 타고 시외로 소풍을 갔는데 집집마다 빨내가 가득가득 널녀 있었습니다. 미국 사람들이 이렇게 빨내를 지독이 많이 하는가 하고 놀라지 않을 수 없었습니다. 그 후 얼마 지나서 또 한번 자동차를 타고 여러 인가 동리를 지나도 빨래 넌 것을 볼 수가 없었습니다. 그 후에 알고 보니까 서양 사람들은 빨래하는 날이 따로 있어서 빨래하는 날은 집집마다 빨래가 가독 널리고 안 하는 날은 안 널렸던 것입니다. 즉 서양 가정에는 한 주일 동안에 시간표가 있어서 월요일에는 빨래를 하고 화요일에는 대림질을 하고 수요일에는 바누질하고 목요일에는 물건 사러 다니고 금요일에는 아는 집 방문하고 토요일에는 대소제하고 상보와 홋니불 세수수건 같은 것 다- 새 것을 갈어 놓은 후 그런 것은 빨래통으로 다- 넣어 둡니다. 그리고 밤에는 식구 다리고 오락을 집에서 하든지 음악회나 극장으로 구경가든지 하고 일요일에는 예배당으로 갑니다. 이것은 집집마다 의론한 듯이 다- 일제히 그런 질서 밑에서 하기 때문에 여간 일이 지장 없이 잘 되는 것이 아닙니다. 우리 생각에는 학교 다니는 학생들이나 시간표대로 생활을 하지 살림하는 주부들이야 닥치는 대로해야지 그것을 어떻게 그렇게 하느냐 하고 웃으실지 모르겠지만은 미국사람들은 그런 주간행사가 정해있기 때문에 가령 말하면 빨래하늊� 날은 손님이 와서 빨래를 못 했다는 일이 없습니다. 우리네 가정에서는 일것 물을 데이고 빨래를 하려고＜114＞잔뜩 채비를 차렸다가도 손님이 오면 그만 중지하고 손님대접하기에 물은 물대로 시켜버리고 맙니다. 손님도 그런 줄 모르고 가서 페를 끼치니까 불안하거니와 손님을 맞는 집에서도 여간 반갑고 그리운 손님이 안닐 때에는 기뿌게 손님을 대하기가 어려운 고로 피차에 자미가 없어지고 일은 일대로 늦어지고 사교도 제대로 안됩니다. 물론 서양사람이라도 기계가 아니고 사람인 이상 빨래하는 날이라도 부득이 남에 집 방문할 일이 생깁니다. 그러나 방문하는 사람도 의례히 빨래하는 날에 방해를 하니까 빨래하는 옆에 가서 죄송스러히 몇마디 급한 말이나 하고 올 줄 알고 방문 받는 자 편에서도 특별히 대접 안해도 일하면서 말대답만 해도 예를 차린 것이 되니까 시간을 허비하지 않고 피차 마음이 편하게 또한 빨래하면서 바누질 걱정을 한다든지 바누질할 때에 빨래나 대소제 걱정하는 부지럽는 걱정이 안 생기고 하는 날은 그 하는 것만 정신과 몸을 쓰면 되니까 뭉테기 걱정 속에 살지 않더라도 살 수 있읍니다. 또한 모-든 것에 순서가 있고 두서가 있고 규모가 있는 까닭으로 먼저 약속 나종 약속에 대한 구별이 있읍니다. 먼저 누구와 약속한 시간이 있으면 그 후에는 그 같은 시간에 천하없이 더 좋은 일이 있다고 해도 먼저 약속을 깨트리지 못합니다. 즉 선약이란 것을 여간 소중이 생각지 안습니다. 그러기에 시간 약속에는 반듯이 선약이 있는가 없는가를 물어 보고 선약이 없다면은 안심하고 그 약속 지킬 것을 신용하고 있읍니다. 사람들이 만약 후약의 구별 없이 같은 시간에 여러 곳 대답했다가 그 때 임박해서 좋은  곳으로 시행한다면 그 여러 곳에서 얼마나 낭패를 많이 보겠습니까? 한 사람 때문에 낭패를 보는 것이 이와 같이 많이 늘 생긴다면 결국 그 사회는 헛수고 헛시간만 보내는 것이니 질서를 잃어버린 사회라고 할 수밖에 없고 질서 있는 사회에서 여러 가지 할 동안 한가지도 변변이 못하는 사회가 될 수밖에 없읍니다. 또한 우리는 물건을 사용할 때 질서가 반듯이 있는 것입니다. 의장에 옷 한 벌만 넣는다면 아무렇게 넣어도 별 상관이 없지만은 옷을 여러 벌 많이 넣어두어야만 할 때에는 얌전히 개여서 차국차국 새둘드려 놓아야만 여러 벌 옷이 구김 없이 잘 들어갈 수 있는 것입니다. 만약 귀찬타고 아무렇게나 꿍져서 트러박어 넣는다면＜115＞ 다음 번에 찾어 입을 때에 구김살이 많이 가고 못 입게 될 뿐만 아니라 어데가 무엇이 들엇는지 참으로 알기가 어려울 것입니다. 즉 의장에 옷을 넣을 때도 질서가 있어야 많은 옷을 잘 넜다 꺼냈다 할 수가 있는 것입니다.\n집안에 물건을 놓고 사는 대도 반듯이 질서가 있어야 합니다. 언제든지 놓일 자리에 꼭 놓여야 하고 또는 큰 물건과 적은 물건 무거운 것과 가벼운 것이 반듯이 그 있을 자리에 있어야 하는 것입니다. 가벼운 물건 우에 무거운 물건이 놓이기 때문에 아래 놓은 물건이 상한다면 누구나 어리석다고 숭을 볼 것입니다. 그러나 놀 자리에 잘못 노아서 손해를 보는 것은 그 뿐만 아니라 다른 경우에 오히려 더 많습니다. 이것 담길 그릇에 저것이 담기고 저것이 담길 그릇에 것이 들어 있는 것이 한 두 가지라도 정신차리기가 어려울 터인데 그런 것이 많고 볼 때에는 아무리 내가 한 것이라도 잃어버리고 알어서 정말 급히 쓰랴고 할 때에는 법석이 이러납니다. 급하고 화나는 바람에 그릇이란 그릇은 다- 쏟다 놓고 장마당처럼 벌려 놓고 가택수색하듯 덤벼서 겨우 나올 때도 있지만은 안 나올 때가 더 많습니다. 그러면 그 결과 어떻습니까? 물건을 간직한다는 것은 필요할 때 뽄있게 생색있게 쓰자는 것이 목적인데 급할 때 그렇게 시간을 허비하고도 못 찾어서 결국은 아무거나 대신 쓴다던지 남에게서 빌려 온다든지 돈을 주고 또 산다든 하는 것은 얼마나 아까웁고 딱한 일인지 모르겠습니다. 가벼운 물건우에 무거운 것을 놓아서 찌그러트리는 것 이상으로 어리석은 노릇입니다. 그런고로 아모리 내 물건을 가지고 나 혼자 산다고 하더라도 짧은 시간에 여러 가지 물건을 틀림없이 사용하려면 질서가 대단히 엄하게 서야만 합니다. 이것이 기억의 힘으로만 되기 어려울 때에는 기록해 놓아도 상관없읍니다. 지금 내가 가지고 있는 물건을 전부 조사해서 기록한다면 쓸데없는 헛수고 같지만 이것이 이 이다음에 더 큰 헛수고를 덜기 위한 것이면 핊�는 것이 퍽 지헤롭습니다. 큰 상점에서는 반듯이 한 달에 한번식 在庫品을 調査하는데 사사 가정에서는 무슨 큰 형식을 차릴 필요는 없드라도 일년에 한 두 번 한가한 틈을 타서 나의 소유의 유무와 없어진 것과 상한 것과 고칠 것을 정리하는 때가 꼭 있어야겠습니다. 그리하여 그것을 그릇마다 장소마다 분명히＜116＞ 기록해 두었으면 좋으리라고 생각됩니다. 그리고 매일 쓰는 책상이나 설압이나 부엌 찬장 속이라도 속속트리 매일 쓰지 않는 것이 있어 급할 때에 덧놓고 덧놓는 일이 있다면 일주일에 한번식 정해 놓고 再整理를 꼭하면 時間 얼마 아니 걸리고도 필요할 때 安心하고 自信있게 끄내여 쓸 수가 있읍니다. 또 없어진 것 다쓴 것 상한 것은 표해 두었다가 사러 나갈 때에 고칠 때에 한꺼번에 할 수가 있으니까 얼마나 편한지 모르겠습니다. 가령 말하면 쓰고 온 우산살이 불어젔는데 위선 오늘은 안 나갈 터 이니까하고 그냥 처박어 두었다가 하로 이틀 지나면 잊어버립니다. 비가 와서 쓰고 나가려고 페볼 때 비로소 그 우산살이 부러진 것이 발견되고 못 고친 것이 생각납니다. 그 때 당장 고칠 수도 없고 갑작이 새 것을 사려니 더 비싸게 주고도 변변한 것을 못사게 됩니다. 의복이나 우리 일상 쓰는 도구가 다- 그렇게 될 경우가 퍽 많습니다. 그러니까 한 주일에 한 번식 어느 날 저녁 후 같은 시간에 한 삼십분 잡어서 집안을 다- 돌보며 각금 쓰는 물건은 다- 한번 조사해 보면 그 값이 반듯이 나옵니다. 오히려 자미있는 노릇입니다.\n또한 여러 식구가 한 집에 살 때에는 아무리 물건을 둘 자리에다가 틀림없이 둔다고 하더라도 다른 식구가 별 뜻 없이 그것을 집어다 쓰고는 어디다가 도루 넣어 두어야 좋을지 몰라서 딴 자리에 굴러다니기가 쉽습니다. 그럴 때에 딴 곳에 넣어 두기 시작하면 점점 물건이 간 곳을 모르고 살어서 쓰려고 할 때에는 없어서 기막히고 답답합니다. 그러므로 규모 있는 집에서는 무슨 큰그릇을 해 놓고 어느 곳으로 가 있어야 할 물건인지 자세히 몰를 것이 있으면 다- 그 그릇에 넣어둡니다. 그러면 무슨 물건이던지 놓인 자리에 없을 때에 그 그릇에 가보고 찾어다가 그 임자는 자기 본 자리에로 돌릴 수 있읍니다. 몇 식구 되지도 않는 가족끼리 너무 법이 많으면 ”°뜻한 맛이 적다고 비난하실 지 모르지만 그런 사소한 일이라고 예사로 알고 모른 체 하다가 오히려 서로 얼굴을 붉히고 말이 거칠게 나가고 의까지라도 상하기 쉬우니까 이 질서라는 것은 결국 큰 병을 앓지 않으려고 예방주사를 하는 괴롬과 수고에 비할 수가 있읍니다.\n어떻든 우리들 신녀성들은 새로운 생활에 전진합시다.\n(끝) ＜117＞\n＜110-117＞","magazine":"삼천리 제14권 제1호","date":"1942년 01월 01일","title":"Women and the New Life:

adopted the strategy of localized destruction (局部擊破) and never once issued an order for destruction across the entire front (全線擊破).\nThat is, at the beginning of the war, he concentrated the full force of the tank divisions in the central region, surrounded and annihilated the large Red Army forces massed in the Minsk area, and finally halted the advance of the central front near Smolensk. Then, moving from the three Baltic states to the attack on Leningrad, he utilized the Southern Army, which had maintained complete silence since the war began, to carry out the Ukraine campaign. As a final measure, he again shifted the focus of the attack to Moscow, succeeding in encircling and annihilating it frontally. In this way, he always concentrated his full strength on one point, showing a very cautious offensive posture of striving for certain victory by exerting all his power. However, as the situation completely changed, the Red Army was already caught in the German army's encirclement network across the entire front. When it became known that the approximately five million soldiers who had been equipped right after the war began had weakened in combat power along with their equipment, President Hitler decided there was no longer a need for such a cautious, focus-based strategy. Except for the Leningrad siege, he finally issued the order for an all-out attack (一齊進擊) to all troops, commencing the Germans' vaunted Blitzkrieg (電擊戰) and entering the final offensive battle.\n\nNow, this strategy of President Hitler bears a resemblance to the therapeutic strategy of \"Wakamoto\" (와까모도), which, against the numerous pathogenic bacteria and viruses that have threatened human life since ancient times, vertically deploys white blood cell units (白血球部隊), develops its specialty annihilation battles (縫滅戰) to thoroughly attack the headquarters of the disease, and simultaneously launches an all-out attack with high-performance Vitamin B1 units (비타민B1 部隊), powerful digestive enzyme units (消化醉素部隊), and other various nutritional units (榮養諸部隊) to completely achieve the treatment objective.\n\nThat is, against respiratory system pathogens like the common cold (感氣), pneumonia (肺炎), and tuberculosis (結核), which one must guard against as it gets colder from now on, it adopts a strategy of defeating each unit individually, deploying increased numbers of elite white blood cell units (精銳白血球部隊) to encircle and annihilate these large forces. Subsequently, against the gastro<118>intestinal symptoms prone to co-occur due to the toxins produced by these pathogens—namely, loss of appetite (食慾不振), weak stomach (胃弱), indigestion/constipation (消化不良便秘), stomach/intestinal catarrh (胃腸가다루), etc.—it employs powerful assimilating Vitamin B1 units (强力同化性비타민B1部隊) and a complex action of the three major digestive enzyme armies (三大消化酵素軍) (starch-digesting enzyme, protein-digesting enzyme, fat-digesting enzyme), which are extremely scarce in single yeast agents (單一酵母劑), to halt the forward deterioration. Simultaneously, not only is it used in conjunction with Vitamin B1, but it also utilizes the powerful Vitamin B2 complex units (비타민B2複合部隊)—recognized for their marked detoxifying effect (害毒作用) against the harmful poisons that excessive intake of things like sugar, liquor, and tobacco nowadays inflict on the living body, or against toxins produced within the living body by pathogens like the tuberculosis bacterium—shifting the focus of the attack directly to these toxins and succeeding in the encirclement battle. Finally, employing hormone-like substance units (홀몬性物質部隊), it mixes in insulin-like substances (인슈링 類似物) to annihilate diabetes mellitus (糖尿病) with a special effect operation (特效作戰). In this way, it always concentrates elite units on one point, showing an extremely careful treatment state that aims for complete cure by exhausting all strength. On the other hand, in cases where resistance to pathogens is weakened due to general weakness (全身虛弱), malnutrition (榮養不足), pre/postnatal weakness (産前産後의 虛弱), etc., it supplies glycogen (구리고-겐), which is immediately absorbed and utilized as a nutrient source, forming a source of vitality (精力의 給源) and simultaneously repelling night sweats (盜汗), insomnia (不眠症), etc. High-grade amino acids (高級아미노酸), lecithin (레치친) for nerve and brain nutrition, other organic phosphate salts (有機憐酸塩), ergosterol (에루고스테린), the precursor of Vitamin D necessary for the formation of bones and teeth, iron (鐵分), calcium (카루슘), and other inorganic components (其他無機成分)—all these elite units are supplied in an all-out attack (一齊進擊). Through the combined action of the various components mentioned above, it manifests the so-called cell protoplasm activation effect (細胞原形質賦活作用), which is the core of \"Wakamoto's\" unique healing and health maintenance.\nThe reason this agent is favored for promoting metabolism (新陳代謝), recovery from fatigue (疲勞), chronic gastrointestinal diseases (慢性胃腸病), tuberculosis (結核), pleurisy (助膜炎), diabetes mellitus (糖尿病), pre/postnatal conditions, weak children (虛弱兒), or prevention of premature aging (早老豫防), etc., mainly lies here.\n(Price: 300 tablets, 25-day supply, 1 yen 60 sen. Sold at agreed prices depending on the region.)<119>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis 1942 article from the magazine *Samch'ŏlli*, written under the pseudonym Oksan Pain, draws an elaborate analogy between Hitler's military strategies on the Eastern Front (specifically, shifting from focused attacks to an \"all-out attack\") and the supposed therapeutic action of a nutritional supplement called Wakamoto. It details how Wakamoto allegedly deploys various \"units\" (vitamins, enzymes, nutrients) to combat illnesses like colds, tuberculosis, digestive issues, and diabetes, much like an army attacking pathogens and toxins within the body. The article concludes by listing Wakamoto's benefits and price. For historians, this piece is interesting as it blends contemporary war commentary (presenting Nazi Germany's military strategy in a seemingly neutral or even implicitly positive light) with commercial advertising within the context of colonial Korea. It showcases how global events were framed and utilized for marketing purposes, reflecting the information environment and perhaps societal attitudes during that period under Japanese rule.\n\n**Named

medicine (藥) before. Yet, for some reason, I have been fond of using only \"Wakamoto\" (와까모도) for the past two or three years. It started when my mother always kept it on the dining table (食卓), so I tried it wondering what it was. Even if I eat a lot of food (飮食), I don't get an upset stomach, and it happened to be during the midsummer Dog Days (三伏間); because I habitually took \"Wakamoto\" after meals (食事), I passed the time quite safely (無事). Perhaps (或) you might think this is like some kind of advertisement (廣告), but everyone in my family (家族) takes it after meals (食後) without fail. Firstly, it has no side effects (副作用), and since there is absolutely (絶對) no constipation (便秘), I think it is especially excellent for women (女子). My mother is now seventy-one (七十一歲), but perhaps because she takes \"Wakamoto,\" she eats so much every day (每日) that I feel like she overeats; every time she has a meal, she says, \"I ate deliciously,\" and always eats exactly three bowls.<119>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis short piece by Japanese writer Hayashi Fumiko is a personal endorsement of the digestive aid \"Wakamoto.\" Published in the Korean magazine *Samch'ŏlli* in 1942, she describes how her family, including her elderly mother, regularly uses the product after meals, praising its effectiveness in preventing indigestion and constipation without side effects. For historians, this article is interesting as it reflects the promotion and consumption of Japanese commercial products (Wakamoto) in colonial Korea, showing a facet of cultural and economic integration during the late colonial period. It also provides a small window into everyday health concerns and remedies common at the time.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n林 芙美子\tはやし ふみこ\tHayashi Fumiko\n와까모도\t와카모토\tWakamoto\n\n**Glossary**\n\n藥\t약\tMedicine\n놓와둠\t놓아둠\tPlacing, leaving (older spelling)\n웬일인지\t웬일인지\tFor some reason\n食卓\t식탁\tDining table\n始初\t시초\tThe beginning, the start\n飮食\t음식\tFood and drink\n배탈\t배탈\tStomachache, upset stomach\n안여름\t한여름\tMidsummer (older spelling)\n三伏間\t삼복간\tThe Dog Days (hottest period of summer)\n習慣的\t습관적\tHabitually\n퍽\t퍽\tVery, quite\n無事하게\t무사하게\tSafely, without incident\n或\t혹\tPerhaps, maybe\n廣告\t광고\tAdvertisement\n家族\t가족\tFamily\n때놓지않고\t빼놓지 않고\tWithout fail, without skipping (older spelling/form)\n모다\t모두 다\tAll, everyone (older form)\n食後\t식후\tAfter a meal\n服用\t복용\tTaking medicine\n副作用\t부작용\tSide effect\n便秘\t변비\tConstipation\n絶對로\t절대로\tAbsolutely\n女子\t여자\tWoman\n일흔하나\t일흔하나\tSeventy-one\n잡수시다\t잡수시다\tTo eat (honorific)\n느끼리만치\t느낄 만큼\tTo the extent that one feels (older form)\n세공기식\t세 공기씩\tThree bowls each (older spacing/spelling)\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n잡지명\t삼천리 제14권 제1호\n발행일\t1942년 01월 01일\n기사제목\t名士의 말 健康의 마스코-트\n필자\t作家 林 芙美子\n기사형태\t잡저\n\n名士의 말 健康의 마스코-트\n\t\t\t\t\t\t作家 林 芙美子\n나는 지금까지 藥이라는 것을 그다지많이 먹어본일이 없습니다. 그러면서도 웬일인지 『와까모도』만은 二三年前부터 愛用하고 있습니다. 우리어머니가 늘食卓위에 놓와둠으로 어떤것인가요 먹어본 것이 始初입니다만 飮食을 많이먹어도 배탈이나는 일이없고, 때마침 안여름 三伏間이였읍니다만 食事뒤에 習慣的으로 『와까모도』를 먹기 때문에 퍽 無事하게 지냈습니다. 或, 무슨 廣告가치 생각할지 모르겠읍니다만 우리 家族들은 누구나때놓지않고 모다 食後에는 服用합니다. 첫째 副作用이없고 便秘는 絶對로 없으니까 女子들께는 더욱 훌륭한것이라고 생각합니다. 저의어머니는 지금 일흔하나(七十一歲)입니다만 『와까모도』를 服用하시는 때문인지 너무 잡수신다고 느끼리만치 每日 食事하실때마다 「맛있게 잡수셨다고」하시며 꼭꼭 세공기식드십니다.＜119＞\n＜119＞","magazine":"삼천리 (三千里)","date":"1942년 01월 01일 (January 1, 1942)","title":"Words of Notables: The Mascot of Health"},{"path":"89_14.01_1942.01/230.txt","issue":"89_14.01_1942.01","content":"Wartime Health and Pulmonary Tuberculosis\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Medical Doctor Cha Kyunhyŏn\nThe author, after passing through Nanjing's University of Nanking (金陵大學) and graduating from Huron College in the United States (美國), suffered from lung disease (肺病). He then re-entered university medical school, specialized in medicine, obtained a medical doctorate, cured his own illness, and currently operates a sanatorium (싸나토륨, Tuberculosis Sanatorium) in White Haven, Philadelphia. It is noted here that \"Lung Disease and Prevention,\" published herein, is a popular lecture written simply in the most plain colloquial style so that anyone can read it. <121>\n\n1.\nIt is a well-known fact (周知) that tuberculosis (結核) is a type of infectious disease. The bacterium that causes this disease is called Bacillus Tuberculosis, and the person who first discovered this bacterium is German (獨逸) medical doctor R. Koch. Bacillus Tuberculosis is divided into three types. The first, which gives tuberculosis to humans, is called Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Lomonis. The second, which gives tuberculosis to cattle (牛族), is Borine Fonn [form]. The third, which gives tuberculosis to birds (鳥類), is called Avian Fonn [form]. Avian Fonn [form] cannot give tuberculosis to humans, but Borine Fonn [form] can cause bone tuberculosis (骨結核) and lymph node tuberculosis (淋巴線 結核) in humans. Therefore, it is appropriate to drink milk and eat beef only after boiling them sufficiently.\n\nAs you all know, tuberculosis is the disease that causes the most disaster to people, and there is no place where this disease does not exist. In 1931, 35,818 people died from tuberculosis in the United Kingdom (英國), and in 1930, 84,741 people died from tuberculosis in the United States (美國). Currently, in the United States, about 8 out of every 100 deaths are due to tuberculosis. In the Mainland (內地, Japan), the number of deaths from this disease is about 130,000 per year, <120> which is about 18 per 10,000 people, and the number of patients has reached several million. In Korea (朝鮮), the current number of patients with this disease is about 400,000, and the number of deaths per year reaches over 40,000. In various countries in Europe and America (歐美), the number of deaths from tuberculosis decreases every year. The reason is that the public is educated on tuberculosis prevention methods, and the public strives to practice prevention. Therefore, in the United States, whereas 2,019 per 100,000 people died from tuberculosis in 1900, 30 years later, in 1930, it reached the small number of 115 per 100,000 people.\n\n2.\nThe most important things in tuberculosis prevention are considered to be correcting the habit of pulmonary tuberculosis patients spitting phlegm, and properly disposing of that phlegm. A pulmonary tuberculosis patient in the second stage coughs up a large number of tuberculosis bacteria, about 1 to 4 billion, every 24 hours. Tuberculosis bacteria can live in dried phlegm for up to 3 years. When phlegm spat onto the road by a pulmonary tuberculosis patient dries, becomes dust, and is scattered everywhere by the wind, most of it dies without causing disease. Some bacteria enter people with high resistance and also die without causing disease. However, bacteria that enter the bodies of those who have long eaten non-nutritious food due to life difficulties, or young people who have neglected their health due to being engrossed in work or study, will certainly cause tuberculosis.\n\nTuberculosis usually develops in young men and women between the ages of 18 and 35.\nTuberculosis infection (傳染) can occur in various ways. If a pregnant woman is a tuberculosis patient, it is not impossible for the tuberculosis bacterium to pass through the placenta (胎盤) and give the disease to the fetus. Pathologists (病理學家) dissecting those who died from tuberculosis can get an injury on their hand, and tuberculosis can develop from that wound. Or, while handling beef containing tuberculosis bacteria, if one cuts their hand, tuberculosis can start from that wound. Sometimes, while laundering the clothes of a tuberculosis patient, skin tuberculosis (皮膚結核) <121> can start on the hands. Tuberculosis in young children mostly occurs due to the carelessness of parents. When young children crawl around the room, they put anything they can grab into their mouths. As soon as they put an object contaminated with tuberculosis bacteria into their mouth, the bacteria enter through the tonsils (扁桃腺) and cause tonsil tuberculosis (扁桃腺結核). Afterwards, it can sometimes move from the tonsils to the lymph nodes (淋巴腺) in the neck, causing lymph node tuberculosis. From the lymph nodes in the neck, the tuberculosis bacteria can spread the disease to the bronchial lymph nodes (氣管枝淋巴腺), or enter the veins (靜脈), go to the lungs (肺臟), and cause pulmonary tuberculosis. If children eat food contaminated with tuberculosis bacteria, they can get abdominal lymph node tuberculosis (腹部淋巴腺 結核), and in adults (壯丁), the bacteria pass through the stomach and intestines, enter the veins again, go to the lungs, and cause pulmonary tuberculosis. Tuberculosis infection mostly occurs through the respiratory tract. Breathing air dusty with tuberculosis bacteria is very dangerous. However, even more dangerous is sitting in front of a pulmonary tuberculosis patient who coughs without covering their mouth and breathing that air; this is truly a dangerous thing.\n\n3.\nThe types of tuberculosis are divided into various kinds according to the initial point of invasion. For example, there are lymph node tuberculosis (淋巴結核), cerebral tuberculosis (腦結核), digestive tract tuberculosis (消化器管結核), bone tuberculosis (骨結核), liver tuberculosis (肝腸結核), circulatory system tuberculosis (循環器結核), pulmonary tuberculosis (肺結核), etc. Among these various types, the one we should pay the most attention to is thought to be pulmonary tuberculosis, and I would like to briefly write a few words about it.\n\nPulmonary tuberculosis is classified into two types: acute (急性) and chronic (慢性). Acute pulmonary tuberculosis can invade adults (壯丁) or children (小兒) regardless of age. There are also two types of acute pulmonary tuberculosis: the first is acute tuberculous pneumonia (急性 結核性肺炎), and the second is called acute tuberculous bronchopneumonia (急性 結核性 器管枝肺炎). Acute tuberculous pneumonia involves the entire lung starting from one lobe (肺葉). A pure lung is a light organ like a sponge (海綿) with much air. However, a lung affected by acute tuberculous pneumonia increases in weight, and air cannot enter the lung. Therefore, the organ that was normally like a sponge becomes like a liver (肝). Thus, patients with this disease suffer greatly from difficulty breathing (呼吸困難). This disease usually starts when a normally healthy adult (壯丁) temporarily neglects their health and their resistance weakens. For example, let's say a healthy person went fishing (낙시질) early to an outer village (外村). After playing all day without eating lunch, they return home at sunset. On the way back, they are suddenly caught in a downpour (소나기) and get all their clothes wet (衣服). <122> After arriving home, unable to overcome their fatigue, they lie down and fall asleep in a cold room without changing their wet clothes. After waking up from sleep, their whole body aches and shivers (오력), and they start coughing (기침). Every time they cough, their left or right chest feels sharp stabs (콕콕 쏘다). Even taking one deep breath makes their side ache (옆구리가 결리다). Following this, a fever (열기) rises, and each time they cough, they spit out phlegm mixed with blood (피가 섞인 가래침). Not only that, but the difficulty breathing is severe, making it impossible to lie comfortably in bed. Even after suffering like this for 8 or 9 days, the fever does not subside, and all symptoms worsen. At this time, if their sputum (唾液) is examined, numerous tuberculosis bacteria (結核菌) are seen in it. This is acute tuberculous pneumonia. Patients suffering from this type of pulmonary tuberculosis often die within 10 days of the disease's onset. However, some suffer for 1 to 3 months before dying. The second type of acute pulmonary tuberculosis is called acute tuberculous bronchopneumonia. This disease can affect healthy young people, but it mostly occurs in young people whose bodies and minds have been weakened for various reasons over a long period. The symptoms at its onset are varied. It can start with shivering, chest pain, then coughing and fever, or it can start with loss of weight (體量) and energy (기력), accompanied by fever and loss of appetite (口味). Unexpectedly, it can also present with hemoptysis (喀血). One can die within 1 or 2 months (朔) of the disease onset, or sometimes the acute form turns chronic (慢性), confining one to bed for several years. This disease also occurs in young children. It especially occurs in children weakened after suffering from measles (홍역) or whooping cough (百日咳) for some time. For example, a child suffers from whooping cough for 1 or 3 months, the cough gradually improves, and they start eating a little food, but then the cough starts again, they lose their appetite and cannot eat, their body weight and energy decrease, they have a fever in the afternoon, and night sweats (허한) at dawn. Suffering like this, they can die in just one month, or sometimes the acute form changes into chronic tuberculosis, causing prolonged suffering.\n\n4.\nChronic pulmonary tuberculosis (慢性的 肺結核) mostly occurs in young people (from 18 to 35 years old). When this disease develops, numerous tuberculosis nodules (結核종기) form in the lungs, and tuberculosis bacteria gradually invade the lungs along the bronchi (器管枝), forming cavities (空洞). Chronic pulmonary tuberculosis starts from pneumonia (肺炎), usually beginning in the right lung (右便 肺臟).\n\nThe onset and symptoms of chronic pulmonary tuberculosis <123> are not the same for every patient. Some patients experience little suffering, merely feeling a bit weak (기력), only discovering they have pulmonary tuberculosis during a physical examination. For some patients, this disease starts like indigestion (消化不良). For women, it can sometimes manifest as irregular menstruation (月經不順), or occasionally start like malaria (학질). Sometimes it starts like a throat infection (咽喉), with voice change (음성) being the first sign, or it may begin with swelling of the lymph nodes (淋巴腺) in the neck. For some patients, it starts like neurasthenia (神經衰弱), and sometimes it begins with pleurisy (肋膜炎).\n\nAn easily recognizable onset symptom is hemoptysis (喀血). Hemoptysis usually occurs at night. One wakes from sleep, feels something warm and salty-tasting in the mouth, spits it out, and finds it is blood.\nHemoptysis can also occur during exercise. 60 to 80 percent (割) of pulmonary tuberculosis patients experience hemoptysis, and in the early stages, 10 percent (割) begin with hemoptysis. The amount of hemoptysis can range from a few drops to about three teacups. The cause of hemoptysis is the formation of a lesion (腫物) in the lung, where a blood vessel within that sore (헌데) weakens and ruptures. The amount of hemoptysis depends on the size (大小) of the damaged blood vessel. While it is rare for someone to die instantly from hemoptysis in the early stages of pulmonary tuberculosis, <124> a patient who has been ill for a long time can die instantly if they suddenly spit up a large amount of blood.\n\n5.\nGenerally, pulmonary tuberculosis begins with a cough (기침). One coughs upon waking in the morning, after talking a lot, while eating, while talking during meals, or when walking quickly. As the cough gradually worsens, phlegm (가래춤) develops, and as phlegm increases, one cannot sleep at night. There might be no cough while sitting, but coughing starts as soon as one lies down, or when turning from one side to the other while lying down. The more one coughs, the more the voice changes, and sometimes one becomes unable to eat. Young people and some female patients may cough for a long time without producing phlegm. They do not know how to spit out phlegm, so they swallow it instead. Thus, some suffer until death without ever spitting phlegm. When a cavity (穴空) forms in the lung, the amount of sputum (唾液) increases, and some patients spit out 4 or 5 hop (곱부) [approx. 720-900 ml] in 24 hours.\n(To be concluded in the next issue) <125>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis 1942 article by Dr. Cha Kyunhyŏn provides a public health lecture on tuberculosis (TB), particularly pulmonary TB. It explains that TB is an infectious disease caused by Bacillus Tuberculosis, detailing its types (human, bovine, avian) and transmission methods (sputum, contaminated food/milk, respiratory droplets, congenital). The article stresses the danger of dried sputum and coughing without covering the mouth. It presents statistics on TB mortality in the UK, US, Japan (Mainland), and Korea, noting declining rates in the West due to prevention education. It describes acute and chronic pulmonary TB, their symptoms (fever, cough, weight loss, chest pain, hemoptysis), common onset scenarios, and typical patient demographics (young adults 18-35). The piece emphasizes the importance of recognizing early signs and managing infected individuals' sputum. From a historical perspective, the article is interesting for its stark presentation of TB statistics in colonial Korea (400,000 patients, 40,000 deaths annually) compared to Japan and the West, highlighting a significant public health crisis. It reflects the medical knowledge and public health discourse of the time, framed within the context of \"wartime health,\" potentially indicating heightened concern for population fitness during the war period.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n南京\tN/A\tNanjing\n金陵大學\t금릉대학\tUniversity of Nanking\n米國\t미국\tUSA\n휴-론 대학\t휴론 대학\tHuron College/University\n필라델피아\t필라델피아\tPhiladelphia\n화잇트ㆍ헤븐\t화이트 헤븐\tWhite Haven\n獨逸\t독일\tGermany\nR.

Avian Fonn은 사람에게 結核을 줄 수 없으나 Borine Fonn은 사람에게 骨結核, 淋巴線 結核을 발생시킬 수 있읍니다. 그러므로 우유와 牛肉은 충분히 끓인 후에 飮用 함이 적당합니다.\n여러분들이 다 아시는 바와 같이 結核은 사람에게 가장 재난을 많이 주는 병이며, 이 병이 없는 곳은 없습니다. 1931年에 英國에서 35,818名이 結核으로 사망을 당하였으며, 米國에서 1930年에 84,741名이 結核으로 죽었습니다. 현재 米國서 사망자 100名 중에 약 8名은 結核으로 사망을 당합니다. 內地(日本)에서는 1個年에 本病 사망자수가 약 13萬人이 되며＜120＞ 인구 1萬에 18人 가량인데 환자수가 百數十萬人에 달하였습니다. 朝鮮에는 현재 此病 환자수가 약 40萬人이며 1個年에 사망자가 4萬餘人에 달하고 있읍니다. 歐美 각 국에서는 結核사망자가 매년 감소되여 갑니다. 그 이유는 민중에게 結核 예방법을 교육시키며 또 민중은 예방실행에 노력함이올시다. 이러므로 米國에서 1900년에 10萬名에 2,019人이 結核으로 사망하였으나 30年後 즉 1930年에는 10萬名에 115名 이라는 소수에 달하였습니다.\n\n2.\n結核예방에 제일 중요한 것은 肺結核患者가 가래침 배앝는 습관을 고칠 것과, 그 가래침을 적당히 처치할 것이라고 봅니다. 第2期에 있는 肺結核 환자가 매 24時間 약 10億 내지 40億이라는 다수의 結核菌을 토합니다. 마른 가래침에 결핵균이 3年까지 살 수 있읍니다. 肺結核 환자가 도로에 토한 가래침이 말라서 가루가 된 뒤, 바람에 불려 각처로 헤여질 때에 대부분은 병을 주지 못하고 죽습니다. 어떤 균은 저항력이 많은 사람에게 들어가 그 역시 병을 발생시키지 못하고 죽습니다. 그러나 생활곤란으로 영양이 없는 음식을 오랫동안 먹던 분이든지, 사업에 혹은 공부에 골몰하여 건강에 주의치 못한 청년들의 체내에 들어간 균은 반듯이 結核을 이르킵니다.\n結核은 보통 18歲로 35歲까지의 청년 남녀에게 대개로 발병됩니다.\n結核 傳染은 여러 종류로 전염될 수 있읍니다. 임신한 부인이 結核환자이면 結核菌이 胎盤을 통하여 태아에게 병을 줄 수도 없지 않어 있읍니다. 病理學家가 結核사망자를 해부하다가 손에 상처를 얻는 동시 그 상처에서 結核이 발생되기도 합니다. 또는 結核菌을 포함한 牛肉을 다루다가 손을 버이면 그 상처로부터 結核이 시작될 수도 있읍니다. 혹은 結核환자의 의복을 세탁하다가 손에＜121＞ 皮膚結核이 시작되는 수도 있읍니다. 어린아이들에게 結核이 시작됨은 대부분 부모들이 부주의하므로 인하여 됩니다. 어린아이들이 방안에서 기여 다닐 적에 무슨 물건이든지 손에 잡히기만 하면 입에다 넣습니다. 結核菌이 묻은 물건을 입에 넣는 동시에 그 균은 扁桃腺으로 들어가 扁桃腺結核을 발생시킵니다. 其後에 扁桃腺으로부터 목에 있는 淋巴腺으로 옮겨가서 淋巴腺結核을 발생시킬 적도 있읍니다. 목에 있는 淋巴腺으로부터 結核菌이 氣管枝淋巴腺으로 병을 전염시킬 수도 있으며 혹은 靜脈으로 들어가 肺臟으로 가서 肺結核을 발생시킬 적도 있읍니다. 結核菌이 묻은 음식을 먹으면 어린아이들은 腹部淋巴腺 結核을 얻을 수 있으며, 壯丁은 균이 위장을 통과하여 다시 靜脈을 통하여 肺臟에 들어가면 肺結核을 발생케 합니다. 結核 傳染은 대부분 호흡기를 통하여 전염됩니다. 結核菌이 붙은 먼지 많은 공기를 호흡함은 대단히 위험합니다. 그러나 그 보다 더 위험한 것은 肺結核 환자가 입을 가리우지 않고 기침기츨 때에 그 사람 앞에 앉아서 그 공기를 호흡하는 것은 참으로 위험한 일이외다.\n\n3.\n結核의 종류는 침입하는 초점을 따라 여러 종류로 나노여 있읍니다. 예를 들면 淋巴結核, 腦結核, 消化器管結核, 骨結核, 肝腸結核, 循環器結核, 肺結核 등이외다. 이 여러 종류 중에 우리가 제일 주목할 종류는 肺結核일 줄로 생각하논 바이며, 이에 대하여 간단히 몇마디  적고저 합니다.\n肺結核은 急性과 慢性, 두 가지로 분류되어 있읍니다. 急性 肺結核은 연령을 상관치 않고 壯丁이나 小兒에게나 침입됩니다. 急性 肺結核도 두 가지 종류가 있는데 第1種은 急性 結核性肺炎이고 第2種은 急性 結核性 器管枝肺炎이라고 합니다. 急性 結核性肺炎은 일개 肺葉으로부터 肺臟 전부가 포함됩니다. 순전한 肺는 海綿과 같이 가벼우며 공기가 많이 있는 기관이외다. 그러나 急性 結核性肺炎을 포함한 肺는 그 중량이 증가되며 공기가 肺에 들어가지 못합니다. 그러므로 평상시에는 海綿같던 기관이 肝처럼 됩니다. 그래서 이 병을 가진 환자는 호흡곤란을 많이 당합니다. 이 병은 보통 건강하던 壯丁이 잠시 건강을 부주의하여 저항력이 약하여질 때에 시작됩니다. 예를 들자면 어떤 건강한 사람이 外村으로 낙시질을 일찌기 나갔다고 합시다. 하루종일 점심도 먹지 않고 놀다가 해가 질 때 집으로 돌아옵니다. 돌아오는 도중에서 갑자기 소나기를 맞자 衣服을 전부 적시게 되였습니다.＜122＞ 집에 도착한 후 너무 피곤함을 이기지 못하여 젖은 의복을 갈아입지도 않고 찬방에 누어 잠들게 되었습니다. 한잠 자고 깨치니 오력이 저리고 一身이 떨리며 기침이 나기 시작합니다. 기침 기츨 때마다 左右便 가슴이 콕콕 쏘게 됩니다. 숨만 한번 깊이 쉬드라도 옆구리가 결리군 합니다. 이처럼 되자 열기가 오르며 기침 기츨 때마다 피가 섞인 가래침을 배앝게 됩니다. 그 뿐만 아니라 호흡곤란이 심하여 자리에 평안히 누어있을 수 없습니다. 이렇게 8,9日을 앓아도 열기는 내리지 않고 모든 증세는 더 심하여 집니다. 이 때에 그 唾液을 검사하여 보면 그 중엔 허다한 結核菌을 보게 됩니다. 이것이 즉 急性 結核性肺炎이외다. 이런 종류의 肺結核윊�로 앓는 환자는 그 병이 발생 된지 10餘日에 사망하게 됩니다. 그러나 1個月부터 3個月까지 고통을 당하고 사망케 됩니다. 第2種 急性 肺結核은 즉 急性 結核性 器管枝肺炎이라고 합니다. 이 병은 건강한 청년에게도 걸릴 수 있으나 대부분은 오랫동안 여러 이유로 인하여 신체와 정신이 쇠약한 청년에게 발생됩니다. 그 발생시의 증세는 여러 종류가 있읍니다. 떨리며 가슴이 아프다가 기침이 나자 열기가 오르면서 시작될 수도 있으며, 體量과 기력이 감소됨을 따라 열기가 오르고 口味를 잃으며 시작될 적도 있고 뜻밖에 喀血로 될 수도 없지 않습니다. 이 병이 발생된 지 1,2朔 내로 사망을 당할 수 있고, 혹시 急性이 慢性으로 변하여 여러 햇동안 병석에 누어있기도 합니다. 어린아이들에게도 이 병이 발생됩니다. 특별히 홍역과 百日咳로 얼마간 앓으며 몸이 약하여진 어린아이들에게 발생됩니다. 예를 들면 어린아이가 百日咳로 1朔 혹은 3朔 동안 앓다가 점점 기침도 좀 나아가고, 음식도 조금 먹기 시작할 때 다시 기침이 시작되여 口味를 잃어 음식을 못 먹게 될 뿐만 아니라 신체의 중량과 기력이 감소되고 오후에 열기가 있으며 새벽에 허한이 나게 됩니다. 이처럼 앓으면 불과 일삭에 사망을 당할 수도 있으나 혹시 急性이 慢性 結核으로 변하여 長久히 고통을 받게도 됩니다.\n\n4.\n慢性的 肺結核은 대부분 젊은 사람(18歲로부터 35歲)에게 많이 발생됩니다. 이 병이 날 때에는 肺에 허다한 結核종기가 생기며 器管枝를 따라 結核菌이 점점 肺에 침입하여 空洞이 생깁니다. 慢性 肺結核은 肺炎에서 시작되는데 보통 右便 肺臟에서 시작됩니다.\n慢性 肺結核 시초와 및 그 증세는＜123＞환자마다 그 증세가 동일치 않습니다. 어떤 환자들은 별로 고통 없이 다못 기력만 좀 약하다가 신체검사를 할 때에 비로소 肺結核이 생긴 것을 알게 되며 어떤 환자에게는 이 병이 消化不良처럼 시작되기도 합니다. 여자로 말하면 月經不順한 것으로 발생될 때도 있고, 혹시 학질처럼 시작할 적도 있읍니다. 咽喉처럼 시작되여 음성이 변함이 첫째 징후가 될 적도 있으며, 혹은 목에 있는 淋巴腺이 붓는 것으로 시작될 시도 있읍니다. 어떤 환자들에게는 神經衰弱같이 시작되며, 혹 어떤 때는 肋膜炎으로 시작되기도 합니다.\n알기 쉽게 발생되기는 喀血이 이 병의 시초의 증세가 됩니다. 喀血은 보통 야간에 생깁니다. 자다가 깨인즉 입이 뜻뜻하고 소곰맛 나는 듯 무엇이 있으므로 배앝고 보면 피를 배앝은 것이외다.\n혹시 운동하다가 喀血할 수도 있읍니다. 喀血은 肺結核환자로서도 60割 내지 80割이 있으며, 초기에 一割은 喀血로 시작합니다. 喀血의 분량은 몇 방울로부터 시작하여 찻잔으로 세 개 가량까지 될 수 있읍니다. 喀血의 원인은 肺臟에 腫物이 생겨서 그 헌데 중에 있던 혈관이 쇠약하여 파열되므로 인함입니다. 喀血 분량은 혈관 상처의 大小에 의하여 다르며 肺結核 초기의 喀血로＜124＞ 즉사하는 자는 드믈지만 長久히 앓던 환자로서 갑자기 다량의 피를 배앝으면 즉사할 수도 있읍니다.\n\n5.\n대체로 肺結核은 기침으로 시작됩니다. 아침 자고 일어날 때와 또 말을 많이 한 때나 음식을 먹을 때, 음식을 먹으며 말할 때, 혹 걸음을 빨리 걸을 때에 기침을 깃게 됩니다. 점점 기침이 더하여 질쑤록 가래춤이 생기며 또 가래춤이 생길쑤록 밤잠을 자지 못합니다. 앉아있을 때에는 기침이 없다가도 자리에 눕기만 하면 기침을 깃게 되며 한편에 누었다가 다른 편으로 도라누으려고 할 때에 기침이 시작됩니다. 기침을 많이 기츨쑤록 음성이 변하여 가며 또 음식을 먹지 못하게 될 때도 있읍니다. 나이 어린 분과 혹 어떤 부인환자들은 기침을 오랫동안 기쳐도 가래춤은 없습니다. 그이들은 가래춤을 배앝을 줄을 몰라서 배앝지 않고 삼킴니다. 그리하여 사망을 당할 때까지 가래춤 한 번 아니 배앝고 앓는 이들도 있읍니다. 폐에 穴空이 생길 그 때에는 唾液의 분량이 증가되여 24時間에 4,5곱부씩 배앝는 환자도 있읍니다.\n(次號完) ＜125＞\n＜120-125＞","magazine":"三千里 제14권 제1호","date":"1942년 01월 01일","title":"Wartime Health and Pulmonary Tuberculosis"},{"path":"89_14.01_1942.01/240.txt","issue":"89_14.01_1942.01","content":"After staying overnight in Nara, I departed in the morning and headed for Yamada Station. The weather wasn't perfectly clear, but with only a light layer of thin clouds, it was rather fine and pleasant. Although it was late November, it was as mild as around Ch'usŏk in Seoul; though the persimmon leaves had fallen, the red fruits still hung on the trees, and mandarin oranges (密柑) were fully in season, making it difficult to immediately tell whether it was early or late autumn.\n\nLeaving my luggage at an inn in front of Yamada Station, I first walked to the Outer Shrine (外宮 - Gekū) of Ise Grand Shrine (伊勢神宮 - Ise Jingū). As you may already know, Ise Grand Shrine can be called the patriarch of shrines; there is an Inner Shrine (內宮 - Naikū) and an Outer Shrine. The Inner Shrine enshrines Amaterasu-Ōmikami (天照大神), and the Outer Shrine enshrines Toyouke-no-Ōmikami (豐受大神). Toyouke-no-Ōmikami is the god who exclusively governs the grains that we eat to live. Before paying homage at Ise Grand Shrine, I had thought the Inner and Outer Shrines were in one place, such that one entered the Inner Shrine through the Outer Shrine, but that is not the case. The Outer Shrine, that is, Toyouke Daijingū (豐受大神宮), can be reached from Yamada Station on foot in just about ten minutes. It is set against the backdrop of a quite ruggedly prominent mountain peak called Takakurayama (高倉山), nestled among lush, ancient tall trees like pines (松), cryptomeria (杉), and cypress (檜), which is common everywhere, yet it was enveloped in an ancient (蒼然) aura that seemed even older than Kashihara Jingū (橿原神宮). As you know, shrines have a solemn and dignified (陰嚴) atmosphere, and they are rebuilt on a different site every twenty or thirty years. Although it hadn't been long since this Outer Shrine was moved and rebuilt, perhaps due to the mystical atmosphere emanating from the surrounding forest, it indeed imparted the lofty feeling that only this sacred precinct (祐城) could possess.\n\nJust as I finished paying respects and was about to turn away, the powerful roar of propellers was heard from the southern sky over Takakurayama. Stopping in my tracks, I looked up to see truly enormous heavy bombers, numbering in the dozens, flying in formation. As the situation in the Pacific (太平洋) was signaling urgency, witnessing the valiant figure (勇姿) of the Imperial Army (皇軍) looked truly magnificent and reassuring.\n\nAfter visiting the Outer Shrine, I immediately headed to the Inner Shrine by electric train. In terms of distance, it might be about ten Korean *ri* from the Outer Shrine. Going over a considerably high hill to the north and traveling for a while, I got off the train and walked a short distance, and soon the wide grounds of the Inner Shrine appeared. Time had somehow already passed three or four in the afternoon, and the weather had imperceptibly turned gloomy. <126>\n\nPassing through the tall *torii* (鳥居), a clear stream spanned by a rounded wooden bridge flows across. This stream is the famous Isuzugawa (五十鈴川), and the clarity of its water and the beauty of the autumn leaves along its banks are beyond description by brush or tongue (筆舌). Keeping the stream on my right and heading towards Mount Kasagi (笠置山), I eventually passed the second *torii* (二の鳥居). With each step further inside, the solemn and majestic (崇嚴) atmosphere deepened. Among the centuries-old, thick-trunked pine trees, it was dim enough to be almost dark as dusk was falling, and under that shade, numerous worshippers walked silently back and forth.\n\nSoon, the Prayer Hall (祈禱殿) appeared on the left. Along with the companions traveling with me, I requested a Shinto priest (神官) to light candles on the altar (祭壇). Although simple, we offered a couple of ritual objects (祭物) respectfully brought out by two young girls, knelt down, and prayed for the lasting military fortunes (武運長久) of the Imperial Army (皇軍). While we knelt and prayed silently, the priest sonorously chanted (唱讀) the ritual prayers (祝詞).\n\nLeaving the Prayer Hall, I paid homage at the main sanctuary (本殿). After praying, I looked inside, and for a moment, I thought my face was reflected in the dazzling Sacred Mirror, Yata no Kagami (八咫鏡), enshrined far within. Indeed, the Inner Shrine enshrines Yata no Kagami, one of the Three Sacred Treasures (三種の御神器).\n\nStanding before the simple yet sublime (崇高) main sanctuary, I respectfully contemplated: Amaterasu-Ōmikami (天照大御神) ruled Takamagahara (高天原) and was revered as the Sun Goddess (日大御神). When the Great Goddess sent down the Imperial Grandson, Ninigi-no-Mikoto (瓊瓊杵尊), to Ashihara no Nakatsukuni (葦原中國) to rule this land, she declared, \"The land of abundant reed plains, the land of fresh rice ears of a thousand autumns, the land of myriad autumns (豐葦の原千五白秋瑞橞國) is the land where my descendants shall be sovereign. Go, descendant, and rule it. May the prosperity of the Imperial Throne (寶祚) last eternally, like heaven and earth.\" At the same time, she bestowed the Three Sacred Treasures: Yata no Kagami (八咫鏡), Yasakani no Magatama (八坂瓊曲玉), and Ame no Murakumo no Tsurugi (天叢雲劍), saying, \"When you look upon this mirror, consider it as looking upon me.\"\n\nHerein lies the foundation of the Japanese national polity (日本國體), ruled by the Emperor of an unbroken line for ages eternal (萬世一系). In the 6th year of Emperor Sujin (崇神天皇), that is, Kōki 569, or 2,030-some years ago from now, it was decided to move [the sacred mirror] from within the Imperial Palace to a separate shrine. The shrine built in Kasanui village (笠縫邑) in the region of 'Yamato' (『倭』) was the beginning. Then, 87 years later, in the 26th year of the 11th Emperor, Suinin (重仁天皇 - *Note: Suinin is usually 垂仁天皇*), that is, Kōki 656, in March, it was transferred here to Ise (伊勢). Indeed, one can see its long history.\n\nYesterday, I paid homage at Kashihara Jingū (橿原神宮), which enshrines Emperor Jimmu (神武天皇), and now, having paid homage at the Grand Imperial Shrine (皇大神宮 - Kōtai Jingū, i.e., the Inner Shrine), seeing the boundless dignity preserved amidst a simplicity almost close to nature itself, I felt as though I had finally grasped (體得) the essence of the Japanese spirit (日本精神) and the sublimity (崇嚴) of the Japanese national polity (日本國體) in a tangible way.\n\nIt seems I can assert that it is something lofty, forming the core of a unique Japanese culture in a realm different even from the world of religion, difficult as it is to explain theoretically.\n\nAs the sun gradually set, the solemn and majestic (崇嚴) atmosphere deepened further. Tense worshippers of all ages, men and women, continued to arrive ceaselessly, and in front of the main sanctuary, the sharp sounds of clapping hands (拍掌) arose one after another. Birdsong could be heard here and there from within the forest, but because the worshippers were so quiet and orderly (靜肅), <127> the sound of clapping was the only sound breaking the stillness (靜寂). Truly, one cannot help but be moved by the reverent (敬虔) and sincere (眞摯) attitude of the mainland Japanese people towards the Shrine.\n\nOn the way back, walking along the dense forest path, I reached the bank of the Isuzugawa (五十鈴川) and washed my hands in the clear water. Goldfish as large as carp (鯉魚) gathered from all directions. Perhaps knowing they might be fed, dozens of them—white ones, red ones, ones mottled with black spots—showed no fear of people at all. Generally, within the sacred precincts (神域), animals are highly valued, and killing even goldfish is strictly forbidden, which is why, they say, some are 5, 6, or even 10 years old.\n\nBy the time I finally left the sacred precincts, the sun had already set. Through the utterly still twilight descending like wings, I waited quite a while, then took the electric train directly towards Futami-ga-ura (二見浦).\n\nAfter about a ten-minute ride, we reached the rustic town of Futami-ga-ura. Entering a seaside inn (旅舍) where the sound of waves from Ise Bay (伊勢灣) could be heard crashing, I found that my luggage had already arrived ahead of me from Yamada Station.\n\nFutami-ga-ura is a small town formed by the seaside, consisting of inns, souvenir shops, and restaurants. After dinner, strolling down the brightly lit street, pretty young women in shops here and there called out solicitations in the local dialect. A first-time traveler might feel bewildered about which shop to enter. Local specialties (土産物) include shellfish (貝) and pearl craftwork (眞珠細工品), and a famous food is *sazae no tsuboyaki* (つぼやき) - grilled turban shells (?).\n\nIgnoring this and that, I deliberately sought solitude (孤獨) and turned onto a side path towards the dark seashore. Pine trees stood sparsely, and although there were occasional electric lights, the moonless coast was frighteningly pitch-black (칠칠하다). Standing for a moment facing the dark sea, although the wind was calm (잣것만), the waves endlessly crashed (탕탕 침니다) against the breakwater (防波堤). The sound was heavy (沈重), resonating in my chest and shaking my soul. Thinking that these waves connected to the Pacific Ocean (太平洋), given the times, it didn't sound like ordinary wave noise but seemed to sternly warn me of something.\n\nEven after returning to the inn, my ears kept straining towards the sound of the waves outside the door. I gathered my thoughts once more and clenched my fist tightly in my heart.\n\nThe next day, I intended to greet the morning sun rising over the Pacific Ocean and woke up early, heading out to the shore. Unfortunately, clouds interfered, and I couldn't achieve my goal. I thought I might be the only one up so early, but mainland Japanese people who had come from various places for the holy land pilgrimage (聖地叅拜)—why were there so many? They formed long lines, trailing one after another, also walking silently and quietly towards Futami-ga-ura's famous \"Wedded Rocks\" (夫婦岩). We take the morning train to Nagoya (名古屋). <128>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe author, Yi Sŏkhun, describes his pilgrimage to Ise Grand Shrine in late November 1941 after visiting Nara. He details his visits to both the Outer Shrine (Gekū), dedicated to Toyouke-no-Ōmikami, and the Inner Shrine (Naikū), dedicated to Amaterasu-Ōmikami. He expresses deep reverence for the ancient and solemn atmosphere, the connection to Japanese imperial mythology (Amaterasu, the Three Sacred Treasures, the unbroken imperial line), and prays at the Inner Shrine for the military success of the Japanese Imperial Army. He reflects on understanding the \"essence of the Japanese spirit\" and the \"sublimity of the Japanese national polity\" through this experience. The trip concludes with an overnight stay at Futami-ga-ura, contemplating the Pacific Ocean on the eve of war. From a historical perspective, the article is significant as it reflects a Korean intellectual's seemingly sincere embrace and articulation of Japanese imperial ideology and spirituality (including praying for Japan's military victory) during the late colonial period, just before the outbreak of the Pacific War. Historians might find the author's perspective, language of reverence, and timing particularly noteworthy in understanding the complex range of responses among colonized Koreans under intense assimilation pressure.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n李石薰\t이석훈\tYi Sŏkhun\n奈良\t나라\tNara\n山田驛\t야마다역\tYamada-eki\n伊勢神宮\t이세신궁\tIse Jingū\n外宮\t외궁\tGekū\n內宮\t내궁\tNaikū\n天照大神\t천조대신\tAmaterasu-Ōmikami\n豐受大神\t풍수대신\tToyouke-no-Ōmikami\n高倉山\t다카쿠라산\tTakakurayama\n橿原神宮\t가시하라신궁\tKashihara Jingū\n太平洋\t태평양\tPacific Ocean\n皇軍\t황군\tKōgun (Imperial Army)\n朝鮮\t조선\tChosŏn (Korea - implied by reference to Korean *ri*)\n鳥居\t도리이\tTorii\n五十鈴川\t이수즈가와\tIsuzugawa\n笠置山\t가사기야마\tKasagiyama\n祈禱殿\t기도전\tKitōden (Prayer Hall)\n神官\t신관\tShinkan (Shinto Priest)\n八咫鏡\t야타노카가미\tYata no Kagami\n三種の御神器\t삼종신기\tSanshu no Jingi (Three Sacred Treasures)\n高天原\t다카마가하라\tTakamagahara\n瓊瓊杵尊\t경경저존\tNinigi-no-Mikoto\n葦原中國\t위원중국\tAshihara no Nakatsukuni\n八坂瓊曲玉\t야사카니노마가타마\tYasakani no Magatama\n天叢雲劍\t아메노무라쿠모노쓰루기\tAme no Murakumo no Tsurugi\n日本\t일본\tIlbon (Japan)\n崇神天皇\t숭신천황\tSujin Tennō\n『倭』\t왜\tWae (Yamato)\n笠縫邑\t립봉읍\tKasanui-mura\n重仁天皇\t수인천황\tSuinin Tennō (*Note: Usually 垂仁天皇*)\n伊勢\t이세\tIse\n神武天皇\t신무천황\tJimmu Tennō\n日本國體\t일본국체\tNihon Kokutai\n日本精神\t일본정신\tNihon Seishin (Japanese Spirit)\n鯉魚\t이어\tIngŏ (Carp) / Koi (Japanese Carp)\n二見浦\t후타미가우라\tFutami-ga-ura\n伊勢灣\t이세만\tIse-wan (Ise Bay)\n旅舍\t여사\tYŏsa (Inn/Ryokan)\n眞珠\t진주\tChinju (Pearl)\n夫婦岩\t부부암\tMeoto Iwa (Wedded Rocks)\n名古屋\t나고야\tNagoya\n\n**Glossary**\n\n一泊\t일박\tOne night's stay\n淸朗치\t청랑치\t(Older form) Not clear (weather); modern 청량하지\n秋夕\t추석\tChuseok (Korean harvest festival, mid-autumn)\n뫼시었고\t모시었고\t(Older spelling) Enshrined; modern 모셨고\n祖宗\t조종\tAncestor, progenitor\n蒼然한\t창연한\tAncient, venerable\n陰嚴한\t음엄한\tSolemn and dignified; imposing\n新築\t신축\tNew construction, rebuilding\n叅拜\t참배\t(Older Hanja) Visit to a shrine/temple to worship; modern 참배\n프로페라\t프로펠러\tPropeller\n編隊飛行\t편대비행\tFormation flight\n風雲\t풍운\tWinds and clouds; (fig.) turbulent situation, state of unrest\n勇姿\t용자\tValiant figure, gallant appearance\n里數\t이수\tDistance in *ri* (traditional unit, approx. 393m in Korea, 3.93km in Japan)\n鳥居\t도리이\tTorii (gateway to a Shinto shrine)\n筆舌\t필설\tBrush and tongue; words, description\n崇嚴한\t숭엄한\tSolemn and majestic, sublime\n祈禱殿\t기도전\tPrayer Hall (in a shrine)\n神官\t신관\tShinto priest\n祭壇\t제단\tAltar\n祭物\t제물\tOffering (at an altar)\n武運長久\t무운장구\tLasting fortune in war\n祝詞\t축사\tShinto ritual prayer; Norito\n唱讀\t창독\tChant, read aloud sonorously\n本殿\t본전\tMain sanctuary (of a shrine)\n御神體\t어신체\tObject of worship in which a deity resides (Shinto); Go-shintai\n萬世一系\t만세일계\tUnbroken Imperial line for ages eternal\n國體\t국체\tNational polity, national essence (esp. referring to Japan's emperor system)\n奉齊한\t봉제한\t(Older form?)

The Time of Aspiration\n\nIs it already seven years ago? It's an old story now. A woman's life, like a single grain of barley (麥), should have meaning, finding significance in its purpose for being born.\nIt seems it was with this thought that I decided to become an actress.\nHowever, now that I've come this far and earnestly reflect upon myself, there are times when I want to tear my mouth apart.\nHaving boldly left my strict home, seven years have passed—yet I remain just a grain of barley, having laid no foundation whatsoever as an actress. Perhaps that is why.\nIndeed, fate cannot be controlled or changed, can it?\n(Is there no choice but to endure and overcome?)\nBut somehow, I found myself on the stage, acting in plays, and began to reflect again.\nIn truth, becoming an actress in Chosŏn (Korea) is equally difficult and painful, whether one is plunging in or trying to get out.\nMoreover, my hometown is the commercial capital, Kaesŏng. Thinking that I, born the eldest daughter of a merchant family in such a place, ran away from home to stand on a stage feels astonishing, like someone else's story.\nEven my older brother, the one person who understood me completely and guided me in everything, absolutely would not permit me to become an actress.\nFor exactly three nights, I knelt in my brother's study, undergoing an ordeal regarding my decision. For those three days, like a praying nun, I knelt before my brother, refusing to bend the light of my conscience and resolve.\nLiterature or other arts can be studied alone, and one can quietly present one's work when the opportunity arises, but becoming a theatre actress cannot be achieved within the home or alone. It requires a troupe and a stage where many people watch! Plunging into that sea is unavoidable. This gateway was a terrifying pass that perhaps eight or nine out of ten women who became actresses in those days experienced, but for me, it was an especially difficult one.\nUsing various analogies, he spoke of the decadent (튀영적) atmosphere of the theatre world at that time, saying things like, \"If you just quietly continue attending girls' school, you can pursue higher education as much as you want,\" <130> offering truly earnest advice—or rather, it was almost pleading. But even such a brother finally yielded to my stubbornness, and in the middle of the night, he packed a few clothes and some spending money into a trunk and helped me run away.\nEven now, when I occasionally think back to that time, I cannot stop tears from flowing automatically at the thought of my grateful brother.\nAn unforgettable day, November 6th. Getting off with the troupe at Suwŏn Station, we did what was called *matchi-mawari* (街回り - street procession), something that doesn't exist now. Sitting atop a rickshaw like monkeys, with a trumpeter leading the way, we paraded through the streets.\nI thought only *kisaeng* (courtesans) rode rickshaws, so naturally, it was my first time ever riding one. I didn't even know how to get in, and I remember blushing as the rickshaw puller gave me coaching (코취). The day happened to be bitterly cold, with snow falling like large flakes.\nThe troupe I joined that day—when I first applied powder and first rode a rickshaw—was called Hwang Kŭm-jwa (Golden Seat Troupe), different from today's management structures. The person leading it then was Mr. Kim Kwan-su, who is now the managing director of the Chosŏn Theatre Association (朝鮮演劇協會), and the famous playwright (脚本家) Mr. Pak Yŏng-ho were also there. When I first went to their inn from Kaesŏng, perhaps they didn't believe I had attended a girls' high school. They wrote \"it is a Book\" and asked me to read it, then asked me to write it. Next, they unfolded a program and asked me to read it...\nAnyway, within a few days in this troupe, I was suddenly selected for a major role (?) in the short interlude skits (막간 촌극) that were essential back then. Perhaps I succeeded in that role, because when I returned to the dressing room, the director and several others surrounded me and praised me.\nWhen first appearing on stage, something felt tightly lodged in my throat, blocking my words. The audience side seemed like a raging, stormy sea; I couldn't see anything, just a vast darkness. But as my feet gradually got used to the stage, I began to see the audience seats, and even heard whispers between people in a far corner. After about half a year of acting, I could even hear whispers like, \"Hey, Yang-ch'un is doing quite well today,\" or \"She drew her eyebrows really long.\"\nCompared to the hardships and efforts of others, I relatively easily secured good roles. After leaving Hwang Kŭm-jwa and moving to Tong Kŭk-jwa (Tongyang Theatre Troupe), managed by the novelist Ch'oe Tok-kyŏn, who was the manager, I debuted essentially as a lead actress. Ch'a Hong-nyŏ, famous at the time as the \"actress of tears,\" was also there. She has already departed this world, a memorable actress who showed us the sad, arduous life of the stage—.\n\nII. Yang-sun and the Expression of Parting\n\nThe sounds of the streetcar and a drunkard's song overlap <131> and flow, on a night street where only the gaudy neon lights call out to customers. Returning after acting in a play, Yang-sun, wrapped in boundless fantasies, walked back through the dark alleys of N Town (N町). Suddenly, someone stopped in front of Yang-sun and hurriedly said, \"I'm leaving by train now. It's bound for XX,\" and without listening to Yang-sun's reply, without even giving her a chance to reply, ran off. Staring only at his hastily retreating back, Yang-sun, thoughtless and utterly bewildered, started walking again.\nReturning home, Yang-sun stood leaning against the door, still holding her handbag (핸드백), as if in a waking dream, having lost all sensation. The sound of the dropped handbag jolted her back to reality. She suddenly looked at the train timetable. There were still 20 minutes before the train he mentioned departed.\nAs if pursued, as if pursuing, she ran out.\nIn Yang-sun's mind, only empty taxis waiting for customers in Chongno appeared in close-up (클로즈엎). Yang-sun had been a proud relay runner (리-레선수) in her girls' school days, so using all her strength, she clenched her teeth and ran as far as the front of Hwasin (和信). Borrowing the traffic policeman's gestures, she frantically waved her hands this way and that. But the empty taxi Yang-sun hoped for was nowhere in sight, and the drivers, busy carrying drunkards, only treated her as an obstacle.\nThen I must take the streetcar, she thought, and boarded one. The streetcar, which she usually never thought of as fast or slow, only made Yang-sun's heart race faster. She looked at her watch. Four minutes left. Like mad, she got off the streetcar and ran to the waiting room. She rushed straight to the ticket gate (改札口), only now realizing she didn't have a platform ticket. She went back out, threw down a 10-chŏn coin to buy one, and saw the gate was closed.\nCalling out to the station employee standing over there, she blindly pleaded, \"Onegaishimasu (お願ひします - Please)!\" As soon as the gate was opened, she stumbled onto the platform, almost falling over. The train was about to move with a whistle. She moved from window to window, searching, but he was not seen. She lost the courage to keep searching while holding onto the train window. Slipping from her hand, the relentlessly moving train ran away as if Yang-sun's hand was bothering it. Watching the departing train, she bowed her head, not as a deliberate salute, but unknowingly. Still wondering if he might have seen her, she raised her head again. There was no way he could have seen her. Powerlessly, she took one step, then another, backing away. The platform was now quiet, perhaps all the passengers had left. Amidst the silence, Yang-sun could hear her own breathing. Something bumped into Yang-sun's weak body. Startled, she turned around; it was a signpost reading \"Exit (出口).\" At this moment, Yang-sun's expression was that of a near-perfect, brilliant actress. That face, biting her lips (입살), looking as if about to cry! Powerlessly gripping the railing, she climbed the stairs, feeling ashamed and embarrassed. She took out a handkerchief to cover her face and opened the restroom door. Two ladies in kimonos (和服) looked as if asking who was coming and going, seemingly oblivious to everything else as they applied lipstick (꾸지베니).\nTrying to suppress the welling tears, she buried her face against a pillar, struggling, but to no avail. The tears finally burst forth, heedless of place or propriety.\nAfter crying, feeling somewhat relieved, without even thinking of looking in the mirror, she went out onto the street. The lights were still dim. Rather than resenting him for leaving without a word, Yang-sun's eyes only held resentment for the \"Empty Taxi\" (空車).\n<132>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis memoir by actress Kim Yang-ch'un recounts her determination to pursue a career in theatre in colonial Korea despite strong family opposition, particularly from her supportive but initially disapproving brother. She details her challenging beginnings, running away from her merchant family home in Kaesŏng, her first awkward experiences with an itinerant troupe (Hwang Kŭm-jwa), including street advertising parades and stage fright, and her eventual rise to leading roles in the Tong Kŭk-jwa troupe. The latter part is a poignant, fictionalized (?) vignette about a character named Yang-sun dramatically failing to see someone off at a train station, capturing intense emotion and perhaps reflecting the separations and anxieties of the time. The article offers insight into the social difficulties faced by women aspiring to unconventional careers like acting, the rudimentary and demanding nature of theatre troupes in the 1940s, and the blend of Korean traditions with Japanese colonial influence (loanwords, cultural references). Historians might find valuable the depiction of social norms, the realities of the performing arts under colonialism, and the linguistic landscape showing Japanese and English loanwords alongside older Korean forms.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n金陽春\t김양춘\tKim Yang-ch'un\n現代劇場\t현대극장\tHyŏndae Kŭkchang (Modern Theatre)\n開城\t개성\tKaesŏng\n水原停車場\t수원정차장\tSuwŏn Station\n黃金座\t황금좌\tHwang Kŭm-jwa\n金寬洙\t김관수\tKim Kwan-su\n朝鮮演劇協會\t조선연극협회\tChosŏn Yŏn'gŭk Hyŏphoe\n朴英鎬\t박영호\tPak Yŏng-ho\n최독견\t최독견\tCh'oe Tok-kyŏn\n동양극장\t동양극장\tTongyang Kŭkchang\n동극좌\t동극좌\tTong Kŭk-jwa\n車紅女\t차홍녀\tCh'a Hong-nyŏ\n洋順\t양순\tYang-sun\nN町\tN정/N마치\tN Town / N-chō\n和信\t화신\tHwasin\n\n**Glossary**\n\n女優\t여우\tActress\n放浪記\t방랑기\tWanderer's Record/Journal\n志望\t지망\tAspiration; ambition\n보리(麥)\t보리\tBarley\n리해\t이해\tUnderstanding (Older spelling of 이해)\n튀영적\t퇴영적(?)\tDecadent; retrogressive (Ambiguous term, likely 퇴영적, meaning backward-looking or decadent)\n꿀어 앉아서\t꿇어앉아서\tKneeling down (Older spelling of 꿇어앉아서)\n긔도\t기도\tPrayer (Older spelling of 기도)\n마찌마와리\t마치마와리\tStreet advertising parade (Japanese loanword 街回り, machi-mawari)\n코취\t코치\tCoaching (English loanword, older transliteration)\n막간 촌극\t막간 촌극\tInterlude sketch; short play performed between acts\n데뷰\t데뷔\tDebut (English loanword, older transliteration)\n오바랍\t오버랩\tOverlap (English loanword, older transliteration)\n핸드백\t핸드백\tHandbag (English loanword)\n클로즈엎\t클로즈업\tClose-up (English loanword)\n리-레선수\t릴레이선수\tRelay runner (Older spelling/form)\n개찰구\t개찰구\tTicket gate (Sino-Korean word, common in Japanese usage 改札口)\nお願ひします\t오네가이시마스\tPlease (Japanese phrase)\n꾸지베니\t구치베니\tLipstick (Japanese loanword 口紅, kuchibeni)\n입살\t입술\tLips (Possibly older or dialectal form of 입술)\n럽슴니다\t-습니다/-ㅂ니다\tSentence ending (polite) (-습니다/-ㅂ니다, older spelling form)\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n잡지명\t삼천리 제14권 제1호\n발행일\t1942년 01월 01일\n기사제목\t女優放浪記\n필자\t現代劇場 金陽春\n기사형태\t회고·수기\n\n女優放浪記\n\t\t\t\t\t\t現代劇場 金陽春\n一. 志望하든 時節\n벌서 7年인가 옛 일입니다. 단 한 알 액이 보리(麥)알 같은 여자의 인생도 무슨 의미로서든지 태어난 意義를 보람있게 갖어야 할 것이다.\n나는 이런 생각으로 여배우가 되길 작정했든가 봅니다.\n그러나 지금 여게까지 와서 열심히 제 자신을 반성한 때 제 입을 찢어바리고 싶은 생각을 하는 적이 있습니다.\n대담하게 엄격한 제 집을 나와서 7年이라는 세월이 흘으는 동안- 나는 아직 보리 알 그대로 있을 뿐, 여배우로서의 아무런 터전도 닦지 못했으므로 그런가 봅니다.\n하긴 운명이라는 것은 조정한다든가 바꿀 순 없겠지요.\n(참고 이겨나가는 수 밖에요?)\n하지만 어느 샌가 연극하는 무대 우에서 나를 발견하고 또 생각하게 되었습니다.\n실상 조선에서 여배우가 된다는 것은 뛰여 들기나 헤여 나가기나 매일반으로 어렵고 괴로운 일이라고 할 것입니다.\n더군다나 나의 고향은 商都 개성입니다. 그런 곳 장사하는 집안의 큰딸로 태여난 내가 집을 튀여 나와 무대에 선 일을 생각하면 남의 일같이 놀라운 일입니다.\n단 한분 나를 어데까지던지 리해하시며 무슨 일이던지 이끌어 주시던 오빠께서도 배우가 된다는 일만은 통- 허락하시지 않었습니다.\n꼭 사흘 밤, 나는 오빠의 서재에 꿀어 앉아서 결심에 대한 시련을 받었습니다. 나는 그 사흘동안을 긔도하는 여승 모양으로 오빠의 앞에 꿀어 앉아 내 양심과 결심의 빛을 구피지 않었습니다\n문학이나 그 밖에 딴 예술은 자기 혼자서 공부하고 기회를 타서 살그런히 내놓아야될 것이지만 연극배우라는 것은 집안에서나 혼자는 일워질 수 없는 것입니다. 단체와 여러 사람이 보아주는 무대! 그 바다에 뛰어들지 않고선 안되는 것 이 관문은 오늘날 여배우로 나선 사람이면 십중팔구까지 다- 체혐한 무서운 고개었겠지만 내게 있어선 한칭 어려운 고개였습니다.\n이런 비유와 저런 비유를 들어가면서 그 시절 연극게의 튀영적 분위기랄지 너는 여학교만 그대로 잠잫고 다니면 어데까지든지 높은 공부를 얼마든지 할 수＜130＞있다는 등의 -차므로 간절한 훈계-그보다도 거이 애원이었습니다. 그런 오빠도 마침내는 나의 고집에 풀을 꺾이어 夜半 트렁크에 옷 몇 벌과 용돈 얼마를 쥐어주어 도망을 치게 하였습니다.\n나는 지금까지도 각금 그때 생각을 하면 감사한 오빠의 생각에 눈물이 저절로 흘음을 금치 못합니다.\n아직도 잊어바릴 수 없는 11月 6日, 水原停車場에서 일행과 함께 내려서 지금은 없어졌지만 소위 마찌마와리를 하노라고 人力車위에 원숭이처럼 올나앉아 나팔대를 앞에 세우고 거리를 돌아다녔습니다.\n인력거는 妓生이나 타는 것인 줄 알았기 때문에 생전처음 타든 것은 물론이었습니다만 어떻게 타는 것이지도 몰라 車夫한테 코취를 받어가며 얼굴을 불켰든 생각 마침 날은 차가워 눈보라가 함박같이 퍼붓는 매운 날이었습니다.\n처음 분 발으고 처음 人力車 탄 그날의 劇團은 요새 經營體와는 달러졌지만, 黃金座라는 단체였는데 그때 主宰하던 분은 시방 朝鮮演劇協會 常務理事로 게신 金寬洙氏, 그리고 脚本家로 유명하신 朴英鎬氏 등이였는데 첫 번 내가 開城서 여관으로 찾아갔을 때 고등여학교를 다녔다는 것이 못믿어웠다든가, it is a Book이라고 써 놓고는 읽어보라고 하는가 하면 가시 그걸 써 보라 그랫고 다음엔 푸로그람 한 장을 펼처놓고 읽으라고 하는 등...\n어쨌든 나는 이 극단에서 몇 일 못되어 그 시절엔 꼭 끼어야 하던 소위 막간 촌극에 일약 선발되어 대역(?)을 맡게 되었는데 그 역에 성공하였던지 화장실로 돌아왔을 때 단장이하 여러 사람들은 나를 에워싸고 칭찬하여 주었습니다.\n무대에 나서면 처음엔 무엇인가 목구멍에 꼭 째여 들어서 말 주머니가 매킬 뿐더러 관객편은 노한 파도 이는 바다속 같이 아무 것도 안 뵈고 까-마아득한 것뿐이었습니다. 그러나 차츰 무대에 발이 얽어지기 시작하면서부터는 관객석도 뵈여젔고 심지어는 저-쪽 한편 구석에서 누구누구에게 귀ㅅ속말 하는 것까지 죄-다 들니는 것입니다. 그러기로 반연쯤 연극하니까 얘-양춘인 오늘은 제법 잘 하는데- 혹은 눈섭을 아주 길게 그렸어- 등의 귀ㅅ속말까지 들리어젔습니다.\n나는 딴 사람의 괴롬이나 로력보담도 비교적 헐하게 좋은 역을 얼는 맡었습니다. 황금좌를 떠나서 소설가 최독견 선생이 지배인으로 계시던 동양극장 경영단체 동극좌에 넘어가서부터는 일약 주연급으로 데뷰- 하였고, 거기엔 한참 눈물의 여배우로 이름 날리든 車紅女도 있었습니다. 벌써 그는 이 세상를 떠나 슬픈 무대 고초의 일생을 우리들에게 본 보여준 추억의 여우입니다만-.\n\n二. 洋順이와 離別의 表情\n電車소리와 醉客의 노래 소리가 「오바랍」이＜131＞되여 흘으며 울긋불긋헌 네온만이 손님을 불으는 밤거리입니다. 연극하다말고 돌아오는 때의 마음 洋順이는 한없는 空想에 싸여 컹컴한 N町 골목을 돌아왔음니다. 별안간 洋順이 앞에 발을 멈추고 황급히 「나는 지금 차로 떠남니다.

A poor young man entered a shabby restaurant in a back alley of Vienna (繩也納). He seemed like a wanderer who had come through villages and towns, across fields and over mountains, on a long, distant journey.\nHe looked quite tired. Sitting down at a table, he first took off his glasses and wiped them with a dirty handkerchief. The glasses had become fogged with dust and dew drops from tree leaves. At his table, a certain pretty young woman was eating breakfast while flipping through Shakespeare's \"Cymbeline.\"\nThe wanderer's eyes fell upon a certain page in that book.\n\"Hark, hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings,\"\nThe poem of the lark, beautifully warbling in the blue sky, seemed to be drawn into the wanderer's eyes. - And at that moment,\n\"Ah!\"\nUnwittingly, he exclaimed aloud.\n\"A wonderful melody just came to mind! Isn't there any staff paper (五線紙)? Staff paper?\"\nHe said this, looking around his surroundings. But there was no way staff paper would be in such a place. Looking crestfallen, as if the melody that had surfaced in his head might disappear, he fidgeted.\nThe young woman who had been flipping through the book was initially wide-eyed at this sudden intrusion, then startled by the strange man's actions, she stared fixedly at him for a moment. But, having thought of something, the young woman took a pencil, quickly drew five lines on the back of the menu (메뉴-) on the table, and gave it to the wanderer.\nWithout a word of thanks, the wanderer rapidly wrote musical notes onto the impromptu staff paper (卽製의 五線紙).\nHaving finished writing, he let out a deep breath, smiled faintly, nodded gently (目禮), and showed the melody to the young woman.\n\"Oh, it's truly lovely.\"\nThe young woman who had been reading Shakespeare looked at the score (諳表). Then, suddenly, she grasped the wanderer's shoulders, <134>\n\"Who are you?\" she asked.\n\"Franz Schubert (푸렌쯔ㆍ슈-벨트). Franz Schubert (푸렌쯔ㆍ슈-바트) is sincerely grateful for the staff paper you made.\"\n\"And I feel the honor (光榮) that such great music was written on staff paper drawn on this kind of paper.\"\nThe two shook hands with youthful passion (情熱). Born from this new friendship, \"The Lark's Song\" became known to everyone as a world-famous art song for a hundred years.\n\nA Life of Music, Death, and Dreams\nA life of music, death, and dreams—that indeed is Schubert's romance. Whether this is a true story or fabricated, historians say it is fabricated. However, everyone says that Schubert's composition was always in such a state. In that sense, this romance might as well be called a true story.\nWhen one thinks of Schubert, everyone will immediately recall and feel nostalgic for the movie (映畵) \"Unfinished Symphony.\" Since there are few movies as good, it is the most memorable film among those I recall seeing. Even in that movie, one can see how poor he was, and that is the truth.\nHe was born in 1797 in Lichtental (리히-다-ㄹ) near Vienna (윈나). His father was a poor school principal (校長). A principal, back then in Europe (歐羅巴), meant education was on the scale of a small temple school (절깐 교육), where the school just gathered nearby children to teach them. Schubert himself later became a music teacher at this school.\nSchubert's poverty was extreme, and on top of that, his personality was eccentric (괴상해서), so it's said he sometimes starved. Due to his poor health, whenever that happened, it was to the extent that he thought he might really die, but he lived on, never losing his lonely smile amidst music, death, and dreams. He just continued composing incessantly, and now, every single one of his works holds the world's highest renown (名聲) and is included in concert (콘싸이트) programs (푸로그람). But at the time, nobody recognized them. They were known only among his friends or the students he taught.\n\"Please publish this score.\"\nHe visited a certain publisher and presented a symphony score. The publisher handed the symphony back, saying,\n\"Our publishing house does not engage in charity work (慈善事業).\" That was none other than the immortal (不朽) masterpiece, the \"Unfinished Symphony.\"\nIn 1818, he finally took up a position as a music teacher in the household of Count Esterházy (에스타라지 伯爵家). This was the first guarantee of livelihood (生活保證) he received.\nIt seems he was definitely happy. *[missing text?]* said, \"This was like the first forest *[missing text?]*.\"\nHere, the legend remains of his love affair (戀愛) with the Count's daughter (令孃), Karoline (카로리-느). The movie \"Unfinished Symphony\" portrays exactly this.\nKaroline was 17 at the time and a renowned beauty. It seems plausible that the sensitive Schubert poured his passion into her, but the biographer (傳記作者) whom the author trusts says this is false (거즛). Rather, he fell in love with one resident/servant (住人 하나), <135> but there was a family favored by his rival in love (戀敵), and he was defeated (敗北). Schubert wrote somewhere,\n\"I, along with my lover (music), holding back tears (눈물을 먹음고), left this place.\"\nThe story that the \"Unfinished Symphony\" was left unfinished due to his tragic love (悲戀) with Karoline might be acknowledged as the work of a storyteller's skill (手腕), but it is false anyway (어쨋던 거즛이다).\n\nThe Sad Fate of a Genius\nIf there was musical success during his lifetime, it would be \"Ave Maria.\" This came after leaving the Esterházy household and returning to the streets, where he lived with the poet Mayrhofer (메이로퐈) and the singer Vogl (보그르) in poverty yet amidst artistic passion (藝術的 情熱), much like in the opera \"La Bohème.\"\nAVE MARIA... He felt the melody for this and composed it based on a passage (一節) from Walter Scott's (올타ㆍ스고트) long poem (長篇詩) \"The Lady of the Lake.\" When Vogl sang this piece, people were astonished. It was because it was brimming with faith (信仰) in the Virgin Mary and affection (愛情) for her. People were simply amazed not only by its religious aspect but also its human quality, and they sang this song.\nThus, his name began to bud slightly, but his life became even more difficult (괴로워젓다).\nOne hope he held onto amidst this was to show his work to Beethoven (베-토벤), whom he admired. At that time, Beethoven was the greatest master (大家), and it was very difficult for a mere youth like Schubert to approach him. Seeing this, a sympathetic nobleman took his works to Beethoven for him. But, perhaps it was fate, it was at the time of Beethoven's death (臨終時). Schubert was aghast (기가 막혔다). As if betrayed by his very last hope, his life became pitiable (가엾을 정도로) from then on. At the same time, his body also weakened (衰殘) increasingly (갈사록), and he died young (夭折) in his youth.\nIt is truly said that great art is understood after the author's death, but ****** it is a lonely thing ***** <136> <134-136>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis article recounts the life of Franz Schubert, emphasizing his persistent poverty, ill health, and the lack of recognition he received during his lifetime despite his genius. It touches upon famous anecdotes, such as the possibly legendary story of composing \"Hark! Hark! the Lark\" on a menu and the rejection of his \"Unfinished Symphony\" by a publisher. It also mentions and debunks the myth connecting the \"Unfinished Symphony\" to a failed romance with Countess Karoline Esterházy, while acknowledging his later limited success with \"Ave Maria\" and his profound admiration for Beethoven, whom he tragically couldn't meet properly before Beethoven's death. The article concludes by reflecting on the sad fate of artists whose greatness is only appreciated posthumously.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, this 1942 article from the Korean magazine *Samch'ŏlli* is interesting as it presents a biographical piece on a Western classical composer during a period of intense Japanese colonial control and wartime mobilization. The choice of subject (Schubert, a universally admired but tragic European figure) might represent a relatively 'safe' cultural topic, avoiding potentially sensitive Korean national themes while still engaging with high art.

Written by prominent Korean intellectuals Yi Kwang-su, Chu Yo-han, No Ch'ŏn-myŏng, and Kim Tong-hwan (some using Japanese names), the poems fervently support Japan's war effort. They praise the Emperor's decision, glorify the Japanese military's initial victories (especially Pearl Harbor), laud the sacrifices of soldiers, demonize the Allied powers (US and UK), and call upon Koreans (\"Peninsula's twenty-four million,\" \"Young men of this land\") to join the fight for the \"Great East Asia War\" and Japan, portrayed as the liberator and mother of Asia. For historians, these poems are stark examples of pro-Japanese collaborationist literature produced by leading Korean cultural figures during the late colonial period. They reveal the immense pressure and ideological mobilization efforts under Japanese rule, showcasing how the narrative of \"liberating Asia\" was deployed to rally support for Japan's imperial ambitions, even among the colonized population, and the complex, often tragic positions intellectuals found themselves in.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n李光洙\t이광수\tYi Kwang-su\n香山光郞\t향산광랑\tKōyama Mitsurō\n米國\t미국\tUSA / America\n英國\t영국\tUK / Britain\n東亞\t동아\tEast Asia\n東洋\t동양\tThe East / Orient\n印度\t인도\tIndia\n緬甸\t면전\tBurma\n馬來\t마래\tMalaya\n支邦\t지방\tChina (derogatory term used by wartime Japan)\n南洋\t남양\tSouth Seas\n眞珠灣\t진주만\tPearl Harbor\n半島\t반도\tPeninsula (referring to Korea)\n皇軍勇士\t황군용사\tImperial Army Brave Soldiers\n朱耀翰\t주요한\tChu Yo-han\n松村紘一\t송촌굉일\tMatsumura Kōichi\n太平洋\t태평양\tPacific Ocean\n하와이 群島\t하와이 군도\tHawaii Archipelago\n아리조나\t아리조나\tArizona (USS Arizona)\n오클라호마\t오클라호마\tOklahoma (USS Oklahoma)\n웨스트ㆍ버지니야\t웨스트 버지니야\tWest Virginia (USS West Virginia)\n엔테프라이즈\t엔터프라이즈\tEnterprise (USS Enterprise)\n아메리카\t아메리카\tAmerica\n亞細亞 艦隊\t아세아 함대\tAsia Fleet (US Asiatic Fleet)\n海軍省\t해군성\tNavy Ministry (Japanese)\n大東亞戰爭\t대동아전쟁\tGreat East Asia War\n皇國精神\t황국정신\tImperial Nation Spirit\n盧天命\t노천명\tNo Ch'ŏn-myŏng\n帝國\t제국\tThe Empire (referring to Japan)\n白山靑樹\t백산청수\tPaeksan Ch'ŏngsu\n金東煥\t김동환\tKim Tong-hwan\n太西洋\t태서양\tAtlantic Ocean\n亞細亞\t아세아\tAsia\n北米州\t북미주\tNorth America\n보르네오\t보르네오\tBorneo\n赤道\t적도\tEquator\n比律賓\t비율빈\tPhilippines\n布哇\t포왜\tHawaii (older phonetic transcription)\n英米\t영미\tBritain and America\n南米\t남미\tSouth America\n마닐나\t마닐라\tManila\n日本\t일본\tJapan\n\n**Glossary**\n\n大詔\t대조\tGreat Imperial Edict\n無道한\t무도한\tUnrighteous, immoral\n禍亂\t화란\tDisaster, chaos, calamity\n制覇\t제패\tSupremacy, domination\n非望\t비망\tUnreasonable desire, ambition\n億萬백성\t억만백성\tHundreds of millions of people/subjects (lit. hundred million myriad people)\n恨嘆하시다\t한탄하시다\tLamented, sighed in grief (honorific, older form)\n生靈\t생령\tLiving souls, populace\n혜오시매\t헤아리시매\tWhile considering/thinking (honorific, older form)\n나리신\t내리신\tBestowed, granted (honorific, older form)\n吩咐\t분부\tCommand, order (often from a superior)\n받자왔다\t받자와다\tReceived (deferential/older form, combining 받다 + -잡다 + 오다)\n群島\t군도\tArchipelago, group of islands\n旗艦\t기함\tFlagship\n航空母艦\t항공모함\tAircraft carrier\n屍體\t시체\tCorpse, dead body\n半身不隨\t반신불수\tHemiplegia, paralysis of one side of the body\n損害\t손해\tDamage, loss\n皇國精神\t황국정신\tSpirit of the Imperial Nation (Japan)\n無敵\t무적\tInvincible, unequalled\n憤滿\t분만\tIndignation, resentment\n魚雷\t어뢰\tTorpedo\n蒼空\t창공\tBlue sky\n讚揚하리\t찬양하리\tWill praise, will extol\n功勞\t공로\tMerit, distinguished service, achievement\n號外\t호외\tNewspaper extra\n屈辱\t굴욕\tHumiliation, disgrace\n混血兒\t혼혈아\tMixed-blood child (used derogatorily towards Americans)\n宣戰\t선전\tDeclaration of war\n布告했다\t포고했다\tProclaimed, announced officially\n制服\t제복\tUniform\n校庭\t교정\tSchool grounds, campus\n싸홈터\t싸움터\tBattlefield (older spelling of 싸움)\n悽慘함\t처참함\tMisery, wretchedness, disastrousness (older spelling of 처참)\n익여야한다\t이겨야한다\tMust win (older spelling/form of 이기다)\n나발소리\t나팔소리\tBugle sound (older spelling of 나팔)\n銃\t총\tGun, rifle\n억개\t어깨\tShoulder (older spelling)\n압흐로\t앞으로\tForward (older spelling)\n太西洋\t태서양\tAtlantic Ocean\n北米州\t북미주\tNorth America\n包圍\t포위\tEncirclement, siege\n壓迫\t압박\tOppression, pressure\n砂糖農園\t사탕농원\tSugar plantation\n祖國\t조국\tFatherland, homeland\n젓\t젖\tMilk (breast milk)\n밋고서\t믿고서\tBelieving, trusting (older spelling of 믿다)\n웨침니다\t외칩니다\tShouts, cries out (older spelling/form)\n엇절길\t어쩔길\tWay to manage/handle (older form of 어쩔)\n靈魂\t영혼\tSoul, spirit\n純潔\t순결\tPurity, chastity\n들닌다\t들린다\tIs heard (older spelling/form)\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n잡지명\t삼천리 제14권 제1호\n발행일\t1942년 01월 01일\n기사제목\t戰爭詩\n기사형태\t시\n\n戰爭詩\n宣戰大詔 -

It had taken him nearly ten days to write seventy pages. For his writing speed, this was neither fast nor slow, but he had sat at his desk past midnight the previous night and worked steadily from dawn until noon that day to achieve this result. As a reward for such effort, satisfaction and joy overflowed in his chest as he left the house in the afternoon, holding the thick manuscript. The reason he decided to take it to the post office himself was partly due to considering the editor's urgent situation, pressed for time, and partly from that sense of satisfaction. Moreover, it was Sunday. The thought of spending a leisurely Sunday afternoon on the streets was also not absent.\n\nThough it was the last day of November, the weather was mild, enough to make an overcoat feel cumbersome. The ground was damp, and the streetcar was packed. Citizens never forget the value of a Sunday. It seemed a privilege of city life<146> to have the habit of resting on Sunday in a Sunday way, whether one had spent the weekdays busily or idly. People were dressed up, heading towards their chosen destinations with expressions of enjoyment everywhere. Even if the air inside the streetcar was foul and the crowds on the pavement were stifling, it was no one's fault. With a generous heart, Chunbo unfolded the manuscript in a corner of the streetcar. Having brought it immediately after putting down his pen, he hadn't even had a chance to reread it, let alone revise it. Due to the pressing deadline, even his fussy nature couldn't help it. Setting aside decorum, he traced the words with one hand still holding the pen.\n\nIt was a novel about a love affair. How ignorant and foolishly the world gossiped about the love between two people; a protest against such common sense and malice; the defense of free will in love—that was the theme of the story. Despite the confusing rumors and slander, the couple's resolve strengthened, leading them to decide on marriage. When the heroine had to leave for a short trip, the hero's heart ached as if a part of his own body were being cut away, feeling as though blood would spurt out—this was recorded simply, without embellishment. There are thousands upon thousands of ways to express love in the world, and Chunbo had written many love stories before, but he felt that few were as sincere as this one. It was also true that this literary confidence added another layer to his satisfaction that day.\n\nAfter mailing the manuscript as registered mail at the post office, his heart felt refreshed, as if a heavy burden had been lifted. The anticipation of being able to rest comfortably for a while until the next task arose, without feeling anxious, released his mind all at once. With a light heart, the streets seemed more enjoyable than ever. It was a feast spread out on the ground. Somewhere, it seemed he could hear torches flaring up and bursts of laughter erupting.\n\nThe scene at the busy intersection was colorful and boisterous. People invited to the feast adorned their emotions, their steps light, matching the atmosphere. As if to send congratulatory envoys to this earthly festival today, the distant sky peeked through the clouds with a clear blue face. Chunbo, too, mingled with the crowd like an invited guest, his expression bright. Having written a love story and being able to fathom people's emotions, he might truly be the happiest person among them all. He wore a proud expression, as if holding the key to the secret of their joy.\n\nIn the flower shop, seasonal flowers cut from the greenhouse—carnations, tulips, orchids, marigolds, and the buds of camellias—bloomed like spring. Flower bouquets were symbols of Sunday itself. The flower shop was like a decorator hanging flags of all nations on a festival day.<147>\n\nThe movie theater, attracting people's attention, could be called a special pavilion in the festival grounds. Its warm, dark cavern is a nest where dreams are woven. Wandering the strange border between reality and dreams, people, flushed red, push through the doors, coming and going.\n\nThe department store, unusually crowded today, seemed more fittingly called a lottery hall for entertainment. As if monopolizing the attention of women, the fragrance emitted by these adorned figures filled the store heavily. To Chunbo, they all looked beautiful and fresh. It seems the Creator destined this half of humanity to be the greatest object of hope for the entire lives of the other half. It seems arranged for them to seek the source of hope, ambition, aspiration, and light from this half. If each person simply found their destined other half, it would be fine, but simple tragedies are often crafted by the cruel play of fate. It had already been a year since Chunbo lost his wife. Having drawn this tragic lot, a great loneliness and desolation had overcome him, as if the sun had vanished from the world, as if the boiler in a greenhouse had gone out. But if humans are not to self-destruct through tragedy, they have no choice but to conquer it. If the tragedy arose from choosing the wrong partner in the game of hide-and-seek to find one's half, might there not necessarily be another predestined partner elsewhere? While picturing that destined Pandora in his mind, he had no choice but to continue the endless game of life's hide-and-seek with his eyes blindfolded. When he used to be accompanied by his wife, the women on the street seemed mostly meaningless and insignificant to Chunbo, but now, to his lonely eyes, they appeared with new meaning. In front of these splendid figures who seemed to conceal the ultimate sacred mark of human life, even the proud and arrogant Chunbo couldn't help feeling shabby and insignificant. No matter how hard he tried to steel his heart, he felt like a beggar standing in a flower garden, only highlighting his own loneliness. The department store was a flower garden. Chunbo, swimming through the overwhelming waves, momentarily adorned his entire senses and emotions splendidly.\n\nEscaping the stimulus of this carnival, Chunbo finds refuge in a tea house. The quiet interior of the shop is a social room on a festival day. The murmuring voices mixed with twilight-like cigarette smoke, and the soft chamber music give the room's atmosphere a unique character. While melting into that character, Chunbo gradually felt<148> the gates of his senses, which had opened like a bouquet, begin to close like a clamshell, and instead, the gates of his mind started to open. Music is a wondrous magician that opens the doors of the mind. It is an amazing magician that freely reveals the mysteries of a small universe within the heart. Chunbo thinks that the next greatest happiness on earth after Pandora is music. The genius of Mozart and Beethoven is second only to the genius of the Creator. Music is indeed a happy and joyful accompaniment to a festival day.\n\nChunbo had to accept the invitation to the feast at the most respectable place. He called the hotel to order a meal, and then simply needed to find a companion at the tea house to sit across from him.\n\n\"What do you consider the greatest delicacy?\"\n\"What would it be... the thing I want to eat most after a long time - butter. Yes, I wish I could have some butter. Not the fake kind, the real kind. It's a world full of fakes, you know.\"\n\"There's only one place that serves real butter.\"\n\nThe hotel table is white and immaculate. A flower bouquet is placed there, and beside the table stands a neat waitress—this is another bonus, an extra flower. Proper procedure and etiquette—this is another bonus of Sunday, an extra happiness.\nWine and bread—upon these two elements of the supper, soup, meat, fruit, and tea are added, like adding modern happiness onto the principles of the twelve disciples. Chunbo and his friend are certainly happier descendants living amidst the benefits of modern culture than the ancients with their sacrificial happiness. Today's Sunday happiness seems to reach its final peak at the hotel dinner table. At the dinner table, late enough for lunch but set for an early supper, Chunbo pleasantly contemplated the half-day's proceedings. For him, who rarely came out to the streets, that day truly seemed arranged to give him a particularly fresh impression and joyful emotion.\n\n\"Ancient people only knew how to symbolize Jesus' flesh and blood with bread and wine; perhaps they didn't know how to symbolize fat and grease with butter. Grease as the fuel for activity, the driving force. I never feel happier than when I'm eating butter. This is the true taste of European civilization.\"\nHis friend also seemed quite satisfied with the day's supper. For that cynical friend, who usually wore a bitter expression as if chewing on bitter herbs, this was the most honest confession. Sharing the Sunday happiness even with him, who seemed to have seen nothing but the darkness of the world, doubled Chunbo's satisfaction. <149>\n\n\"Happiness—indeed, when eating butter. Seeing the wrinkles on your face smooth out, maybe happiness really is just that.\"\n\"Have you ever noticed the expression of a child eating candy? That's the expression of happiness.\"\n\"When my mouth is full of milk—when listening to a Mozart sonata—when looking up at the mackerel sky—when receiving the gaze of a beautiful person—when finishing a requested novel manuscript—if these are happiness, then today, more than any other day, I feel like I've tasted all those happinesses at once.\"\n\"When a reformer goes to the guillotine—when Jesus goes to the cross—isn't that happiness?\"\n\"Heavens no. Today is a day to talk about earthly happiness. The happiness of the thorn bush for spiritualists is none of my business.\"\n\"The unhappiness of losing something beautiful—I too, indeed, have lived half my life with so much unhappiness that even my facial expression has become like this, but even on this happy day of yours, another unhappiness awaits me.\"\nThe friend, abruptly returning from the happiness of the dinner table to the reality of the day, recovered his usual bitter expression, as if chewing on bitter herbs.\n\"There's nothing as troublesome as facing death, but I don't know why death is prepared alongside love. I am waiting for death today. In a little while, I have to greet the death that will come to me.\"\n\"Are you determined to drag even me into unhappiness after all? Why must you speak such ill-omened words today, at this table, of all times? Death? What death are you supposed to greet?\"\nChunbo threw his teaspoon onto the plate, his tone quite unpleasant. It felt as though the day's happiness vanished in an instant with his friend's single remark. The shadow of gloom began to cover his heart again, which had been immersed in the happiness of the street after finishing the love story. Like a cruel trick of fate, it came unknowingly.\n\"Speaking of Yŏn, wasn't there that famous musician, renowned as a beauty, whom you also might know? She suddenly passed away in Tokyo, and her body arrives here today. I am one of the people who must go out to meet it.\"\nMore than ten people had gone to study in Tokyo out of admiration for Yŏn. Yŏn was the sun on earth. It was people's destined fate to burn themselves up by getting too close. The sun, which demanded numerous sacrifices, had <150> reached its time to self-destruct. Beautiful things are meant to fade—it was Zeus's initial law to designate only fading things as beautiful.\nWas the friend also one of those who had admired Yŏn? Among those who had died for her, lost their minds, or run away, had the friend kept the sun at a distance, solely cultivating a quiet stream of deep feeling? He calmly spoke of having to greet the death, passing the time until its arrival with Chunbo at the hotel. Was his sorrow also that quiet?\n\n\"In just a few hours, a black carriage carrying the beautiful death will pass quietly right down this street ahead. And I will be one of those following behind it.\"\n\"You've finally said all you had to say, haven't you? You've completely trampled and shattered my day today. It was my mistake and misfortune today to have chosen you, of all people. Go quickly, greet death or whatever it is. Today marks our parting. Destroyer of happiness, ominous shadow.\"\nChunbo left the friend behind and stormed out of the hotel. It was as if he were trying to snatch his body away from the clutches of pursuing misfortune. The delicacies on the table, the flowers, the waitress—all receded behind him. Feeling the black carriage his friend mentioned, due to pass that street in a few hours, appear before his eyes, he shivered and quickly walked away from the hotel front.\n\nMemories of his departed wife began to occupy his mind anew, and the reality of the day's street scene already seemed to fade into the distant past. There was nothing more terrifying than stirring up the rawest wound—the memory of his wife—something he had carefully tried to avoid daily. When it was revived again at that accidental moment by his friend's words, his heart began to ache backwards. As his heart started to ache, the joyful impressions of the day vanished without a trace. The joy of the supper, the mystery of the music, the sensuality of the department store, the luxury of the flower bouquets—all fled at once, vanishing as futilely as soap bubbles.\n\nHis wife, who had lain ill in bed for two long months, had difficulty even breathing on her hospital bed in the final stages. Even setting up multiple oxygen tanks by the bedside and trying to make her breathe the fresh gas had no more effect than a single drop of water on a hot stone. While he tore at his chest in frustration, her body's tissues changed one by one. After she passed away, her body was truly beautiful for a time, like pale wheat. It was a quiet repose, without anxiety, suffering, or unease. That was what death was.<151> When Chunbo thought about how the soul had instantly fled somewhere, leaving only the body behind in the white coffin, in the dark grave, in the eternal, absolute darkness, to gradually decompose and disintegrate, he felt as if his insides were being stabbed deeply with a blunt iron rod, and in that painful, numb sensation, he couldn't comprehend anything. Why was it arranged this way? Why must death invariably accompany life? Faced with that futile death, what on earth is this reality? Reality and death—which one is true and which is false? He couldn't know anything. He tried earnestly to believe in the miracle of Lazarus, sitting blankly before his wife's cold body, but tragically, cruelly, the miracle never occurred. Around the dark day, only the celestial bodies continued their movements as before. Thrashing about and wailing made no difference to the indifferent and cold course of the universe.\n\nFrom this time, a great distrust of the universe's workings began to grow in Chunbo, but faced with the immense will of the universe, such distrust was too insignificant to hold any sway. Yet, all the more, a single thread of doubt still rose sharply. Where on earth did his wife go? His wife, his friend's lover Yŏn, and the countless souls who had previously abandoned reality—where on earth did they go? Might there not be another world made up by them? Why would it be wrong to think of a vast second world behind this reality? If so, is the world of reality merely a simple shell of that second world? If, for instance, one were to gently peel off the surface layer of the earth right now, what would remain behind? Would love, ambition, satisfaction, and happiness still remain in the vast wasteland? Would the happiness of the street, bustling like a festival day—the flower bouquets, the sensuality of the department store, the mystery of the music, the joy of the supper—remain? If so, what is the point of all these things? How futile and insignificant they are. How is the festival of the earth any different from the performance of a clown dancing precariously on a plank laid over empty space? Life is too transient, absurd, and pitiful. What can one believe in, rely on, live for, and should live for?\n\nChunbo had, in fact, thought more than once about leaving the world together with his wife. Life without love was too difficult to endure, and solitude dried up the spirit immensely. Solitude did not make one an aristocrat; it made one a beggar. Living as a desolate,<152> shabby beggar, what could one possibly accomplish? When falling asleep or waking up, tears would constantly stream down, soaking the pillow—a fact known only to himself in the whole world. He could have wailed at the top of his lungs if he wanted to. When warming milk or smelling coffee, thoughts of his wife would suddenly arise, and he'd feel choked up. Thinking of his wife's situation, unable ever again to see the sun or the moon, it was incomprehensible that the earth continued to turn and worldly affairs proceeded as usual. It was outrageous, arrogant, and strange. Day after day, the miracle of his wife's resurrection did not happen; only vast solitude and futile motion remained.\n\nOn this day, again carrying such bitter desolation, Chunbo headed home. The day that had begun so cheerfully took a backward step into unhappy memories due to an accidental trigger, shattering the sense of happiness he had just begun to feel. Now, the street he walked back on began to appear with a completely different impression than when he entered it hours before. In the face of his wife's memory and Yŏn's death, the street should be solemn and reverent. The messy, littered thoroughfare, like the aftermath of a finished feast, is listless and desolate. If this outer layer of the street were gently peeled away again, how much more desolate would it truly be? Chunbo could fully feel that desolation in his heart.\n\nThe people in the streetcar have their makeup faded, their smiles lost, and their steps on the pavement seem listless somehow. The sky is overcast, dark and oppressive, as if snow might fall—the morning and afternoon of Sunday had changed character so drastically. The morning that began with a love story was about to end as an afternoon of gloomy unhappiness.\n\nThe night is quiet and eerie.\nChunbo lit the fire in the room and sat at his desk with the children.\nHe had thought about lighting the stove in the wooden-floored room and listening to music,<153> but suddenly the temperature seemed to drop, and feeling the room might get cold, he decided to heat the ondol floor instead.\nPressing his body against the warm floor, sitting companionably with the little ones, a quiet ray of light began to rise in his peaceful heart. This was another, unexpected happiness.\nHe boiled milk on the portable stove, added sugar, and watched the happy expression on the child's face as they drank it, and gradually that warm feeling began to transfer to Chunbo's heart as well.\nIt was a great help to Chunbo that the children, remarkably, did not fuss looking for their departed mother. Instead, Chunbo often found himself turning away, afraid the children would see him cry, secretly wiping his eyes and stifling a sigh.\nAfter drinking the milk, they started flipping through picture books, taking out colored paper and scissors to begin crafts.\nSitting blankly at his desk under the bright lamp, watching their innocent activities that chattered away, a different sense of happiness, distinct from what he felt on the street during the day, quietly arose in Chunbo. It wasn't the happiness of the adult world, but the happiness of the children's world. It was the clear happiness that comes from watching young souls grow. A flawless, desireless, clean happiness. Unwittingly, his heart began to melt warmly, and he gradually felt himself merging into that young world.\n\n\"Yes, let's write this. Let's write a story for children. Let's depict the way little ones grow.\"\nOn the desk lay manuscript paper and a pen. The unstained, white manuscript paper received the lamplight, white and dazzling as snow.\nThinking about the children's story to be written on that clean virgin page, Chunbo's state of mind became as clear as the paper itself.\n\"There was one more task left for Sunday—to depict the young world. To place hope in humanity and promise another happiness.\"\nChunbo, who had written a love story in the morning, now dipped his pen deep into the ink bottle, intending to present another happiness to mankind. Anticipating the story that would be written in black on the white manuscript paper, the lamp shone brightly.\nIn the quiet night's silence, only the chattering sounds of the little ones echoed limpidly, as if emerging from a fairy tale. - December 8th -<154>\n\n**Summary**\n\nYi Hyo-sŏk's \"Sunday\" follows the protagonist, Chunbo, a writer, through the emotional rollercoaster of a single Sunday in 1942. Initially elated after finishing a manuscript, he enjoys the vibrant city atmosphere. However, a conversation with a cynical friend, who reveals he is waiting for the arrival of the body of a beloved musician (Yŏn) who died in Tokyo, plunges Chunbo back into grief over his wife's death a year prior. The encounter shatters his fragile happiness, leading to existential despair about the meaninglessness of life and reality in the face of death. He returns home despondent, but finds unexpected solace and a renewed sense of purpose in the quiet, innocent presence of his children, deciding to write a story for them. The story contrasts fleeting urban pleasures with deep personal loss and the eventual discovery of hope in family and creativity.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, the story offers glimpses into urban Korean life during the late colonial period (WWII). Mentions of Western cultural elements like butter, classical music (Mozart, Beethoven), department stores, and cinemas alongside traditional elements like the ondol floor highlight the cultural fusion and modernization occurring. The underlying themes of loss, disillusionment, and the search for meaning, while personal, could subtly reflect the anxieties and pressures of living under colonial rule and amidst global conflict. The reference to Tokyo connects to the complex relationship between Korea and Japan during this era. Historians might find the portrayal of individual emotional life, the blending of cultures, and the subtle undercurrents of existential questioning within this specific historical context particularly revealing.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n李孝石\t이효석\tYi Hyo-sŏk\n준보\t준보\tChunbo\n연\t연\tYŏn\n동경\t동경\tTokyo\n\n**Glossary**\n\n마즈막\t마지막\tLast, final (older spelling)\n기뿜\t기쁨\tJoy, happiness (older spelling)\n휘답답할\t거추장스러울\tCumbersome, unwieldy (dialectal/older term)\n포도\t보도\tPavement, sidewalk (used here with the meaning of 歩道, though written 鋪道)\n안해\t아내\tWife (common older term)\n녀자\t여자\tWoman (older spelling)\n차저내다\t찾아내다\tTo find out, discover (older spelling)\n마즈막\t마지막\tLast, final (older spelling)\n벗듸더보아야\t버티어보아야\tEven if one tries to endure/resist (older spelling/form)\n헤여내면서\t헤쳐내면서\tPushing through, wading through (older spelling/form)\n석겨\t섞여\tMixed (older spelling)\n열렷든\t열렸던\tHad opened (older spelling)\n옴츠러\t움츠러\tShrinking, cowering (older spelling)\n열니기\t열리기\tOpening (noun) (older spelling)\n늣기다\t느끼다\tTo feel, sense (older spelling)\n마조앉을\t마주앉을\tTo sit facing each other (older spelling)\n먹구\t먹고\tEating (older spelling)\n녀급사\t여급사\tWaitress (older term)\n례의\t예의\tEtiquette, manners (older spelling)\n느즐\t늦을\tTo be late (older spelling)\n가텃다\t같았다\tWas like (older spelling)\n몰났나부지\t몰랐나 보지\tSeems they didn't know (older spelling/colloquial form)\n늦기는\t느끼는\tFeeling (older spelling)\n구라파\t구라파/유럽\tEurope (older term, from Japanese pronunciation)\n씨니칼한\t시니컬한\tCynical (loanword, older spelling)\n살어오지\t살아오지\tHave not lived (older spelling)\n맙소서\t마옵소서\tPlease don't (archaic/formal negative imperative)\n알바아니야\t알 바 아니야\tNone of my business (colloquial)\n일흘\t잃을\tTo lose (older spelling)\n말었네만\t말았네만\tEnded up (doing something regrettable), but...

그 날은 새벽부터 오정 때까지 꼽박 원고지와 마조 대하고 앉어서야 이루워진 성과였다. 그런 노력의 뒷마춤이라 두틈한 원고를 들고 오후는 되여서 집을 나설 때 미상불 만족과 기뿜이 가슴에 넘첬다. 손수 그것을 가지고 우편국으로 향하게된 것도 시각을 다투는 편집자의 초려를 생각하는 한편 그런 만족감에서 온 것이었다. 더욱이 그 날은 일요일이다. 일요일의 한가한 오후를 거리에서 지내고 싶은 생각도 없지 않었던 것이다.\n십일월이 마즈막 가는 날이언만 날씨는 푸군해서 외투가 휘답답할 지경이다. 땅은 질고 전차는 만원이다. 시민들은 언제나 일요일의 가치를 잊지들은 않는다. 평일을 바뿌게 지냈던, 놀면서 지냈던, 일요일에는 일요일대로의 휴양의 습관을 가짐이 시민생활의＜146＞ 특권이라는 듯도 하다. 치장들도 하고 어딘지 없이 즐거운 표정들로 각각 마음먹은 방향으로 향한다. 전차 속의 공기가 불결하고 포도 위의 군중이 답답하다고 해도 그것은 아무의 허물도 아닌 것이다. 준보는 관대한 심정으로 차ㅅ속 한 구석에서 원고를 펴들고 있섰다. 붓을 떼자마자 가지고 나온 까닭에 추고는커녕 다시 읽어보지도 못했든 것이다. 촉박한 시간의 탓으로 까다로운 그의 성미로서도 어쩌는 수 없는 노릇이었다. 체면불고하고 한 손에 붓을 쥔채 더듬어 나려썼다.\n연애의 일건을 적은 소설이었다. 두 사람의 연애에 대해 세상이 얼마나 무지하고 부지럽는 번설을 일삼었던가, 그런 상식과 악의에 대한 항의, 사랑의 자유의지의 옹호- 그것이 이야기의 테에마였다. 어지러운 소문과 비방에도 불구하고 두 사람의 뜻은 더욱 굳어가서 드디어 결혼을 결의하게 되었다는 것 여주인공이 잠시 여행을 떠나게 되었을 때 마치 육체의 일부분을 베여나 내는 듯 남주인공의 마음은 피가 도다날 지경으로 아펏다는 것을 장식 없이 순박하게 기록한 한편이였다. 세상에 사랑을 표현하는 맘은 천마듸 만마듸 되고 준보는 기왕에 사랑의 소설을 많이도 써왔지만 그 한편같이 진실한 것은 드믈었다고 스스로 생각했다. 그런 문학적인 자신이 그 날의 만족을 한 겹 더 해둔 것도 사실이였다.\n국에서 서류우편으로 원고를 부치고 나니 무거운 짐이나 내려 노은 듯 마음은 상쾌하다. 다음 일이 생길 때까지 당분간 편하게 쉬이고 조바심을 안해도 조타는 긔대가 한거번에 마음을 풀어준 것이다. 가벼운 마음에 거리는 어느 때보다도 즐거운 것으로 보인다. 땅 위에 벌어진 잔치이다. 그 어듸서인지 홰ㅅ불이 타올으고 우슴소리가 터저올으는 것이 들니는 듯도 하다.\n혼잡한 네거리의 표정은 화려하고 야단스럽다. 잔치에 초대를 바든 사람들은 감정을 치장하고 그 분위긔에 마추어 거름도 가볍다. 오늘 이 지구의 제전에 먼 하늘에서는 축하의 사절을 보내렴인지 구름사이로 푸르게 개인 얼굴을 빼꼼이 기웃거리고 있다. 준보도 초대객의 한 사람인양 밝은 표정으로 사람들 속에 휩쓸닌다. 사랑의 소설을 쓰고 사람들의 감정을 헤아릴 수 있는 그야말로 누구보다도 가장 즐거운 한 사람일지 모른다. 사람들의 그 기쁨의 비밀의 열쇠나 잡은 듯이 자랑스런 표정이였다.\n꽃가개에는 온실에서 베여온 시절의 꽃들-카아네슌, 튜으립, 란초, 금잔화의 묵금과 동백꽃의 아람이 봄같이 피여있다. 꽃묵금은 그대로 일요일의 상징이다. 꽃가개에는 잔치날 만국긔를 다른 장식쟁이다.＜147＞\n영화관은 사람들의 인ㅅ긔를 끌어 잔치마당의 특별관이라고 할까. 그 훈훈하고 어두운 굴 속은 꿈을 배이는 보금자리이다. 현실과 꿈의 야릇한 국경선을 헤매이면서 사람들은 버얽어케 상긔되여 문을 밀치고 드나든다.\n이날 유난히도 복작거리는 백화점은 여흥의 추첨장이라고 함이 올흘 듯 싶다. 녀자들의 인ㅅ긔를 독점한 듯 치장한 그들의 뿜는 향긔가 가개 안에 욱욱히 넘친다. 준보에게는 그들이 모다 아름답고 신선해 보인다. 세상 인류의 반을 차지하고 있는 이 반쪽들은 남은 반쪽들의 한 평생의 가장 큰 희망의 대상으로 조물주가 작정해 노은 모양이다. 희망과 포부와 야심과 광명의 근원을 이 반쪽에게서 찾도록 마련해 노은 듯 하다. 각각 한 사람식을 잡아서 그 작정된 반쪽들을 서로 차저내면 그만인 것이나 그릇된 숙명의 희롱으로 말미암아 간단히 비극이 꾸며지곤 한다. 준보가 안해를 일흔지 임의 일년이 된다. 엇저다 이 비극의 제비를 뽑게된 그에게는 일시 세상에서 태양이 없서버린 듯 온실의 보일러가 꺼저버린 듯 커다란 고독과 적막이 엄습해 왔었다. 그러나 사람은 비극으로 말미암아 자멸되지 안으랴면 그것을 정복하는 수밖에는 없다. 각각 반쪽을 차저내는 순라잡기에서 상대자를 잘못 잡아서 생긴 비극이라면 필연코 예정된 배필은 또 달리 있을 것이 아닐까. 그 예정된 판도라를 마음속에 그리면서 두 눈을 싸매운채 한정없는 인생의 순라잡기를 계속하는 수밖에는 없었다. 안해를 동반했을 때는 거리의 녀자들이 거이 무의미한 것으로 대수롭지 안케 보이든 준보였만 이제 외로운 눈에 그들은 새로운 뜻을 가지고 등장하는 것이였다. 인간생활의 마즈막 성스러운 표식을 한 몸에 감추은 듯 보이는 화려한 그들 앞에서 자랑스럽고 교만하든 준보도 초라하고 시산한 심정을 엇저는 수 없었다. 다구지게 마음을 벗듸더보아야 흡사 꽃밭에 선 거지와도 같아서 한 몸의 외로움이 돌녀다 보일 뿐이다. 백화점은 꽃밭이였다. 준보는 욱욱 한 파도속에서 몸을 헤여내면서 전신의 감각과 감정을 한때 찬란하게 장식해 보는 것이였다.\n이 카아니발의 자극에서 벗어나서 준보는 차ㅅ집에서 피난처를 발견한다. 조용한 가개안은 잔치날의 사교실이다. 웅성웅성하는 말소리와 노을가튼 담배연긔에 석겨 야트막한 실내악이 방안의 분위긔에다 독특한 한 가지의 성격을 준다.  그 성격 속에 화해 들어가는 동안에 준보는 차차 꽃다발같이 열렷든＜148＞ 관능의 문이 조개같이 옴츠러 들어가고 그 대신 정신의 문이 열니기 시작함을 늣긴다. 음악은 정신의 문을 열어주는 신기한 요술쟁이다. 마음속에 조그만 우주의 신비를 자유자재로 계시해 보이는 긔막힌 요술쟁이다. 땅 위의 생활에서 판도라의 다음가는 행복은 음악이라고 준보는 생각한다. 모찰트와 베토벤의 천재는 바로 조물주의 천재의 버금가는 것이다. 음악은 참으로 잔치날의 반주로는 행복되고 즐거운 것이다.\n잔치상의 초대를 준보는 가장 젊잔은 자리로 바더야 한다. 호텔로 전화를 걸어 식사의 준비를 분부해 노코 차ㅅ집에서 아무나 자리에 마조앉을 동무 한 사람을 잡아대면 그만이였다.\n「자네 무얼 제일 진미로 생각하나」\n「무엇일꾸 제일 먹구 싶은 것 오래간만에 - 빠터 그래 빠터나 먹었으면 하네. 가짜 말구 진짜 말야. 모두가 가짜의 세상이니 원」\n「진짜 빠터를 대는 곳은 한 군데 밖에 없다네」\n호텔의 식탁은 희고 정결하다. 꽃묵금이 놓이고 상 옆에 등대하고 섰는 깨끗한 녀급사- 이건 또 하나의 덤이요 우수리인 꽃이다. 알마즌 절차와 례의- 이건 일요일의 또 하나의 덤이로 우수리인 행복이다.\n포도주와 빵과- 이 두 가지의 만찬의 원소 위에 쑤웊과 고기와 과실과 차가 더함은 열 두 제자의 절도위에 현대의 행복을 더함이다. 준보들은 확실히 옛 사람들의 희생의 행복보다도 현대적인 문화의 혜택속에 사는 보다 행복된 후손들이다. 오늘 일요일의 행복은 호텔의 식탁에서 그 마즈막 봉오리에 다다른 심이다. 오찬으로는 느즐 정도의 일흔 만찬의 식탁에서 그 차려진 반날의 절차를 준보는 즐겁게 생각하는 것이였다. 자조 거리에 나오지 않는 그에게 사실 그 하로는 특별히 신선한 인상과 즐거운 감동을 주랴고 마련된 것과도 가텃다.\n「빵과 포도주로 예수의 살과 피를 상징할 줄만을 알었지 옛 사람들은 빠터로 지방과 비게를 상징할 줄은 몰났나부지 활동의 연료로 원동력인 비게를. 난 빠터를 먹을 때 같이 행복을 늦기는 때는 없네. 구라파 문명의 진짬맛이 여긔에 있단말야」\n동무도 그날의 만찬에는 저윽이 만족해하는 눈치었다. 소태를 씹어 먹음은 것같이 일상 쓴표정을 하고있는 씨니칼한 그 동무로서는 가장 솔직한 고백이였다. 세상의 어둠속 밖에는  보고 살어오지 못한 듯한 그에게까지 일요일의 행복을 나눈 것이 준보의 만족을 두겹으로 더했다. ＜149＞\n「행복이라는 건-아무렴 빠터를 먹을 때. 자네 얼굴의 주름살이 펴지는 걸 보면 사실 행복이라는 건 바로 그것인가 하네」\n「사탕을 먹을 때의 어린애의 표정을 주의해본 일이 있나. 그것이 행복의 표정이라는 것일세」\n「우유를 입안에 갔득  먹음을 때- 모찰트의 소나타를 들을 때-하늘의 비눌구름을 우러러볼 때- 아름다운 이의 싀선을 바들 때- 청바든 소설원고를 다 썼을 때- 이런 것이 행복이라면 난 어느 날보다도 오늘 그 모든 행복을 한거번에 맛본듯두 하네」\n「개혁가가 단두대에 올을 때- 예수가 십자가에 올을 때- 그런 것은 행복이 아닐까」\n「맙소서. 오늘은 땅 위의 행복을 말하는 날이네. 정신주의자들의 가시덤불의 행복은 내 알바아니야」\n「아름다운 것을 일흘 때의 불행- 나두 사실 반생동안 그 수많은 불행으로 얼굴의 표정까지 이렇게 되고 말었네만 오늘 자네의 이런 행복의 날에도 내겐 또 한가지의 불행이 기다리구있다네」\n동무는 식탁의 행복에서 문득 그 날의 현실로 도라가면서 소태를 씹어 먹음은 것 같은 일상의 쓴 표정을 회복했다.\n「죽엄을 당할 때 같이 맘 성가신 노릇은 없는데 웨 사랑과 함께 죽엄이 마련됐는지 모를 노릇이야 난 오늘 죽엄을 기다리구 있다네. 좀 있다가 내게로 올 죽엄을 마지해야 된단말야」\n「긔어쿠 자넨 나까지 불행속으로 끌고 들어가고야말 작정인가. 웨 하필 오늘 이 식탁에서 불길한 소리를 해야한단 말인가. 주 죽엄이라니 무슨 죽엄을 마지한단 말인가」\n준보는 차ㅅ수가락을 접시 위에 내던지면서 적지 안이 불유쾌한 어조였다. 하로의 행복이 동무의 그 한마듸로 금시 사라지는 것과도 같었다. 사랑의 소설을 끝마치고 거리의 행복에 잠겼든 그의 마음에 다시 우울의 그림자가 덥치기 시작했든 것이다. 가혹한 운명의 작란같이 그것은 모르는 결에 왔다.\n「연이라면 자네두 암즉한 미인으로 일홈높은 음악가가 있짢었나. 동경서 돌연히 세상을 떠나서 그 죽엄이 오늘 이 곳에 도착된다네. 나두 그것을 마즈러 나가야할 사람의 하나란 말야」\n연을 사모해서 동경으로 류학을 떠난 사람은 열 손가락에도 남었다. 연은 땅위의 태양이였다. 가까히 가서는 스스로 몸을 태워버리는 것이 사람들의 작정된 운명이였다. 수많은 히생을 요구한 태양은 스스로＜150＞ 자멸할 때가 왔든 것이다. 아름다운 것은 꺼지는 법- 꺼지는 것만을 아름다운 것으로 작정해 놓은 쥬스의 당초부터의 법측이였든 것이다.\n동무도 연을 사모해 온 사람들 중의 하나였든가 혹은 자진하고 혹은 실성해지고 혹은 도망가고 한 중에서 동무는 그 태양체를 멀니다 두고 오로지 한  줄기의 고요한 심회를 독구워온 것이였을까. 그는 죽엄을 마지하라 함을 고요히 말하면서 그것이 도착하기까지의 시간을 호텔에서 준보와 같이 지우고있는 것이다.  그의 슬픔도 그와 같이 고요한 것이였든가.\n「앞으로 몇 시간만 있으면 아름다운 죽엄을 실은 검은 수레가 바로 이 앞길을 고요히 지낼테구. 나두 그 뒤를 따르는 한 사람이   것일세」\n「자넨 결국자네 할 말을 다 한 셈이지. 나의 오늘 하로를 왼전히 밟어버리구 부서 노았단 말이지. 하필 자네를 골은 것이 오늘의 내 불찰이구 불행이였었네. 어서 죽엄이든지 무었이든지 마지러 가게나. 자 오늘 자네와는 작별이네. 행복의 파궤자 불길한 그림자」\n준보는 동무를 버려둔 채 휭하니 호텔을 나셨다. 흡사 뒤를 쫏는 불행의 마수에서 몸을 빼치랴고 하는 것과 같은 신융이였다. 식탁 위의 진미도 꽃도 녀급사도 등뒤에 멀어졌다. 동무가 말한 몇 시간 후에 그 앞길을 지낼 검은 수레가 눈앞에 보여오는 것 같어서 몸서리를 치면서 호텔앞을 잰 거름으로 떠났다.\n가버린 안해의 긔억이 새삼스럽게 마음을 점령하기 시작하면서 그 하로의 거리의 현실은 발서 먼 옛일같이 멀어저 가는 것이였다. 가장 앞은 상처인 안해의 긔억을 들치우는 것 같이 무서운 노릇은 없어서 일상에 조심하고 주의해 오든 것이 그 우연한 시간에 동무의 말로 말미암아 다시 소생될 때 마음은 되로 저리기 시작했다. 저리기 시작하는 마음에 즐겁든 하로의 인상은 종적없이 사라저 가는 것이였다. 만찬의 깃쁨도 음악의 신비도 백화점의 관능도 꽃묶음의 사치도 한거번에 줄다름질 치면서 비누거품같이도 허무하게 꺼저 버리는 것이였다.\n두 달 장간을 병석에 누었든 안해는 마즈막 시기에는 병원침대에서 호흡조차 곤난해갔다. 산소탱크를 여러 통식 침대마테 세우고 그 신선한 긔체를 호흡시‚¨다고 했댓자 단돌에 한 방울 물만큼의 효과도 없었다. 가슴을 뜨드며 안타까워하는 동안에 육체의 조직은 각각으로 변해갔다. 운명한 후 육체는 한때 마알간 밀같이 참으로 아름다웠다. 초조도 괴롬도 불안도 없이 고요한 안식이였다. 그것이 죽엄이라는 것이였다.＜151＞ 령혼은 금시 어듸로 도망해 버렷는지 남겨진 육체만이 흰 관속에서 어두운 무덤속에서 영원한 절대의 어둠 속에서 차차 해체되고 분해될 것을 생각할 때 준보는 무딘 쇠몽둥이로 오장육부를 푹, 푹, 찔니우는것 같어서 그 아프고 마비된 감각 속에서는 아무 것도 헤아릴 수가 없었다. 웨 그런 마련인구- 생명과 함께 웨 반다시 죽엄이 있어야 하는구- 그 허무한 죽엄 앞에서 이 현실이란 대체 무었인구- 현실과 죽엄과 어느 편이 참이구 어느 것이 거짓인구- 아무것도 알 수가 없었다. 진정으로 라사로의 기적을 미더보랴고 안해의 차듸찬 몸 앞에 우두커니 앉어 보았으나 참혹하게도 가혹하게도 긔적은 종시 이러나지 않었다. 어두운 날을 둘너싸고 일월성신의 운행만이 전날과 같이 게속될 뿐이였다. 발버둥을 치고 통곡을 해 보아야 깟닥 동하지 안는 무심하고 냉정한 우주의 운행이였다.\n이때부터 준보에게는 우주의 운행에 대한 커다란 불신이 생기기 시작했스나 너무도 위대한 우주의 의지 앞에 그 불신쯤은 아무 주장도 가지지 못하는 하잘 것 없는 것이였다. 그러면 그럴사록 한 줄기의 회의는 여전히 날카롭게 솟아올났다. 안해는 대체 어듸로 간 것일까. 안해와 동무의 애인 연이와 그들이 전에 현실을 버린 수많은 령혼들은 대체 어듸로 간 것일까. 그들 말이 꾸미고 있는 또 하나의 세상이라는 것이 있지 않을까. 이 현실의 등뒤에 커다란 제2 세계라는 것을 생각하는 것이 웨 그른 것일까. 그러타면 현실의 세계는 그 제2 세계의 단순한 껖질에 지나지 안는 것일까. 지금 가량 지구의 표피를 하 거풀 살몃이 벗겨서 들어내 버린다면 그 뒤에 무었이 남을 것인가. 광막한 황무지에 여전히 사랑이며 야심이며 만족이며 행복이며 하는 것이 남을 것인가. 잔치날같이 번화한 거리의 행복이- 꽃묵금이, 백화점의 관능이, 음악의 신비가, 만찬의 깃쁨이 남을 것인가. 그러타면 이런 것들은 대체 무었하자는 것인가. 얼마나 허무하고 하잘 것 없는 것인가. 지구의 제전은 허공위에 널쪽을 깔고 그 위에서 위태한 춤을 추는 광대의 노름과 무었이 다르단 말인가. 인생이란 너무도 속절없고 어처구니없고 얘숙한 것이다. 무었을 믿고 무었에 의지하고 무었을 위해서 살어갈 수 있으며 살어가야 할 것이랴.\n준보는 사실 안해와 함께 자기도 세상을 버렸으면 하고 생각해본 적이 한 두번이 아니였다. 사랑 없는 생활은 너무도 견듸기 어려운 것이였고 고독은 엄척나게 정신을 매말니우는 것이였다. 고독은 사람을 귀족으로 맨드는 것이 아니라 거지로 만들었다. 쓸쓸하고＜152＞ 초라한 거지의 신세로 살어서는 무슨 일을 칠 수 있을꾸 생각되였다. 잠 들 때에나 잠을 깨일 때 눈물이 작구만 줄줄 흘러서 벼개를 적시는 것은 세상에서 단 한사람 자긔 혼자만이 아는 노릇이였다. 목청을 노아서 울래도 넉넉히 울 수 있는 노릇이였다. 우유를 따뜻하게 데울 때에나 커피냄새를 마틀 때 문득 안해의 생각이 나면서 목이 매켜 늣기곤 한다. 다시 두 번 결코 해도 달도 볼 수 없는 안해의 처지를 생각할 때, 지구가 여전히 돌고 세상일이 여전히 진행되여 나가는 것이 알 수 없는 노릇이였다. 불측하고 교만하고 이상스런 일이였다. 가는 날 오는 날 안해가 부활되는 긔적은 니러나지 안코 막막한 고독만이 허무한 운행만이 남을 뿐이였다.\n이 날은 또 하로 그런 쓰라린 적막심을 품고 준보는 집으로 향하게 되였다. 멋처럼 즐겁게 시작된 날이 우연한 실마리로 인해 불행한 추억 속으로 뒤거름질 처들어가서 일껏 늣기기 시작한 행복감이 산산히 부서저 버렸다. 이제 되걸어 나가는 거리는 몇 시간 전 들어올 때와는 판이한 인상을 가지고 비취이기 시작했다. 안해의 추억과 연이의 죽엄 앞에서 거리는 응당 엄숙하고 경견해야 할 것이다. 잔치가 끝난 뒤ㅅ마당 가의 너저분히 어지러운 행길은  허분허분하고 쓸쓸하다. 이 거리의 껍질을 다시 한거풀 살몃이 벗겨 놋는다면 참으로 얼마나 더 쓸쓸할 것인가. 준보는 마음속으로 그 쓸쓸함을 족히 늣기는 것이였다.\n차 속 사람들은 화장이 지워지고 우숨을 잃었고 포도 위 거름에는 어듼지 없이 풀이 빠저보인다. 하늘은 흐려 눈이래도 나릴 듯 어둡고 답답하다- 일요일의 오전과 오후는 성격이 이렇게도 달너졌다. 사랑의 소설로 시작된 오전은 우울한 불행의 오후로서 끝나랴는 것이였다.\n밤은 조용하고 괴괴하다.\n준보는 방에 불을 지피고 아해들을 데리고 책상 앞에 앉었다.\n마루방 난로에 불을 피우고 음악을 들닐까 하다가＜153＞별안간 긔온이 내리며 방이 추어질 것 같어서 온돌에 불을 때기로 했다.\n따뜻한 방바닥에 몸을 부치고 어린것들과 동무하고 앉으니 평화로운 마음에 한 줄기 고요한 빛이 솟기 시작했다. 예측하지 안었든 이것은 또 하나 다른 행복이였다.\n풍로에 우유를 끌여서 사탕을 너코 어린것이 그것을 입안에 먹음은 그 행복스런 표정을 살피노라니 준보의 마음에도 점점 그 따뜻한 감정이 옮아오기 시작했다.\n아해들은 신통하게도 간 엄마를 차저서 복개지 안는 것이 준보에게는 큰 도움이였다. 준보는 도리혀 자긔가 눈물을 흘리게 될 때 아해들에게 들키울까 겁이 나서 외면하고 살몃이 눈을 흠치고 한숨을 죽이는 때가 많었다.\n우유를 마시고 나드니 그림책을 들척어리고 색종이와 가위를 내서 수공을 시작하고 하는 것이였다.\n밝은 등불아래에서 잭갈거리는 그 무심한 양을 바라보면서 책상 앞에 우두커니 앉어있는 준보에게는 낮에 거리에서 늣긴것과는 또 다른 행복감이 유역히 솟아올랐다. 어른의 세상의 행복이 아니라 아해들 세상의 행복이였다. 어린 혼들의 자라 가는 깃쁨을 바라보는데서 오는 맑은 행복감이였다. 흠없고 무욕하고 깨끗한 행복감이였다. 어느 결엔지 마음이 따뜻하게 녹아지면서 차차 그 어린 세상 속에 화해 들어감을 늣겼다.\n「올치 이것을 쓰자. 아해들의 소설을 쓰자. 어린것들의 자라는 양을 그리자」\n책상 위에는 원고지와 펜이 노였다. 때 뭇지 않은 하아얀 원고지가 등불을 바더 눈같이 희고 눈부신다.\n그 깨끗한 처녀지위에 적을 어린 소설을 생각하면서 준보의 심경도 그 종이와 같이 맑어갔다.\n「일요일의 임무는 또 한가지 남었든 것이다- 어린 세상을 그리는 것이다. 인류에 희망을 두고 다른 행복을 약속할 것이다」\n아츰에 사랑의 소설을 쓴 준보는 이제 또 다른 행복을 인류에게 선사하랴고 잉크병 속에 펜을 잠북 담었다. 흰 원고지위에 깜았케 적히울 이약이를 긔대하면서 등불은 교교히 빛나고 있다.\n조용한 밤 적막 속에 어린것들의 잭갈거리는 소리만이 동화 속에서나 우러나오듯 령롱하게 울니는 것이였다.   -12월 8일-＜154＞\n＜146-154＞","magazine":"삼천리 제14권 제1호","date":"1942년 01월 01일","title":"Novel: Sunday

Co-Prosperity Sphere (大東亞共榮圈建設) for the 1.3 billion various peoples of the Orient (東洋) who groaned under the aggression and exploitation of America and Britain (米英). December 8th (12月 8日), never to be forgotten! We humbly offer our gratitude that within three days of the war's outbreak, the US-British Pacific Fleet (太平洋艦隊) was annihilated, and further, the greater part (太半) of the enemy's air power was crushed, completely seizing command of the sea and air (制海, 制空權) in the Pacific (太平洋); this was due to the hand-to-hand bloody battles of the peerlessly loyal and brave officers and men of our Imperial Army (皇軍將兵). Let us solidify the resolve of the Peninsular populace (半島민중) by cherishing the certain victory of this Holy War (聖戰), the first since the nation's founding (肇國), and let everyone strive to fulfill the duties of the home front citizens (銃後國民).\n\nThe lecture notes of Chōsen Army Chief of Staff Takahashi (高橋 朝鮮軍參謀長) and Colonel Kuroki (黑木 大佐) of the Chōsen Naval Officer's Office (朝鮮海軍武官府) on \"Certain Victory in the Greater East Asia War (大東亞戰爭必勝),\" along with the speeches by Mr. Yun Ch'i-ho (尹致昊氏) and four others at the \"Decisive Battle Grand Speech Rally (決戰大演說會)\" sponsored by the National General Mobilization Chōsen League (國民總力朝鮮聯盟), and the speeches by Mr. Yŏ Un-hong (呂運弘氏) and five others at the \"Crush America and Britain Grand Speech Rally (米英打倒大演說會)\" sponsored by the Chōsen Wartime Service Patriotic Corps (朝鮮臨戰報國團), are truly great lion's roars (大獅子吼) of patriotic fervor rarely seen in recent times, and we believe they are giant bombs thrown to the entire Peninsular populace.\n\nAs adding flowers to brocade (錦上添花), in literature, the \"Pacific War Poetry Special Feature (太平洋戰爭詩特輯)\" by Ch'unwŏn (春園) and three others is, we are confident, a good harvest under wartime conditions. Besides these, Mr. O Chae-sŭng's (梧材升雨氏) \"Observations from Taiwan (臺灣) and Central China (中支視察記)\" and Economic Prosecutor (經濟檢事) Kang Chung-in's (姜仲仁氏) \"Recent Economic Crimes (最近의 經濟事犯)\" are also considered beneficial reading material under the current situation. <155-155>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis editorial postscript from the January 1942 issue of *Samch'ŏlli* magazine celebrates Japan's early victories in the Pacific War (termed the Greater East Asia War), portraying Japan as a liberator of Asia from US/British imperialism. It praises speeches and writings by Japanese military officials and prominent Korean figures (like Yun Ch'i-ho, Yŏ Un-hong, and Yi Kwang-su/Ch'unwŏn) promoting the Japanese war effort and urges the Korean population (\"Peninsular populace\") to fully support Japan as \"home front citizens.\" The piece reveals the intense pro-Japanese propaganda prevalent in colonial Korea during wartime, showcasing how Korean intellectuals and organizations were mobilized or coerced into collaborating with the Japanese imperial project. Historians would find this article valuable for understanding the rhetoric used to justify the war, the nature of Korean collaboration, and the ideological pressures faced by Koreans under Japanese rule during World War II.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n米英\t미영\tMi-Yŏng (USA & Britain)\n東洋\t동양\tTongyang (The Orient/East Asia)\n大東亞共榮圈\t대동아공영권\tTae Dong'a Kongyŏngkwŏn (Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere)\n我帝國\t아제국\tA Cheguk (Our Empire - Japan)\n太平洋艦隊\t태평양함대\tT'aep'yŏngyang Hamdae (Pacific Fleet)\n太平洋\t태평양\tT'aep'yŏngyang (Pacific Ocean)\n皇軍將兵\t황군장병\tHwanggun Changbyŏng (Imperial Army Soldiers - Japanese)\n半島\t반도\tPando (Peninsula - Korea)\n高橋\t다카하시\tTakahashi\n朝鮮軍參謀長\t조선군참모장\tChosŏn'gun Ch'ammojang (Chief of Staff of the Chōsen Army - Japanese Army in Korea)\n朝鮮海軍武官府\t조선해군무관부\tChosŏn Haegun Mugwanbu (Chōsen Naval Officer's Office)\n黑木 大佐\t구로키 대좌\tKuroki Taisa (Colonel Kuroki)\n國民總力朝鮮聯盟\t국민총력조선연맹\tKungmin Ch'ongnyŏk Chosŏn Yŏnmaeng (National General Mobilization Chōsen League)\n決戰大演說會\t결전대연설회\tKyŏlchŏn Tae Yŏnsŏrhoe (Decisive Battle Grand Speech Rally)\n尹致昊\t윤치호\tYun Ch'i-ho\n朝鮮臨戰報國團\t조선임전보국단\tChosŏn Imjŏn Poguktan (Chōsen Wartime Service Patriotic Corps)\n米英打倒大演說會\t미영타도대연설회\tMi-Yŏng T'ado Tae Yŏnsŏrhoe (Crush America and Britain Grand Speech Rally)\n呂運弘\t여운홍\tYŏ Un-hong\n春園\t춘원\tCh'unwŏn (Pen name of Yi Kwang-su)\n太平洋戰爭詩特輯\t태평양전쟁시특집\tT'aep'yŏngyang Chŏnjaeng Si T'ŭkchip (Pacific War Poetry Special Feature)\n梧材升雨\t오재승우\tOjae Sŭng'u (Likely pen name for O Chae-sŭng)\n臺灣\t대만\tT'aewan (Taiwan)\n中支\t중지\tChungji (Central China - Japanese term)\n經濟檢事\t경제검사\tKyŏngje Kŏmsa (Economic Prosecutor)\n姜仲仁\t강중인\tKang Chung-in\n經濟事犯\t경제사범\tKyŏngje Sabŏm (Economic Crime)\n\n**Glossary**\n\n搾取\t착취\tExploitation\n하에서\t하에서\tUnder (Slightly older form of '-하에' or '-아래에')\n신음하다\t신음하다\tTo groan, moan\n敢然히\t감연히\tBravely, daringly\n일어섯습니다\t일어섰습니다\tStood up, rose up (Older spelling/conjugation of 일어서다)\n肇國\t조국\tFounding of the nation\n聖戰\t성전\tHoly War\n必勝\t필승\tCertain victory\n持輯하여\t지집하여\tTo cherish, hold dear (Archaic verb form, likely meaning 'cherishing' or 'holding onto')\n半島\t반도\tPeninsula (Referring to Korea)\n민중\t민중\tThe populace, the masses\n銃後國民\t총후국민\tHome front citizens (Civilians supporting the war effort)\n의무\t의무\tDuty, obligation\n힘쓰사이다\t힘씁시다\tLet's strive, let's make an effort (Older hortative ending)\n參謀長\t참모장\tChief of Staff\n武官府\t무관부\tMilitary Officer's Office\n速記\t속기\tShorthand, stenography\n聯盟\t연맹\tLeague, federation\n決戰\t결전\tDecisive battle\n演說會\t연설회\tSpeech rally, lecture meeting\n臨戰\t임전\tWartime, facing war\n報國團\t보국단\tPatriotic corps/group (Often used for wartime mobilization groups)\n打倒\t타도\tOverthrow, strike down, crush\n獅子吼\t사자후\tLion's roar (Metaphor for a powerful speech/proclamation)\n錦上添花\t금상첨화\tAdding flowers to brocade (Idiom: Adding beauty to beauty, making something good even better)\n文藝\t문예\tLiterature and arts\n收擭\t수확\tHarvest, reaping (Here used metaphorically for literary output)\n視察記\t시찰기\tObservation report, account of an inspection tour\n事犯\t사범\tCriminal case, offense\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n잡지명\t삼천리 제14권 제1호\n발행일\t1942년 01월 01일\n기사제목\t편집후기\n기사형태\t사고·편집후기\n\n편집후기\n米英의 침략과 搾取하에서 신음하던 東洋 13億의 諸 민족의 大東亞共榮圈建設을 위해서 我帝國은 敢然히 정의의 검을 들고 일어섰습니다. 영원히 잊을 수 없는 12月 8日! 개전 3日만에 米英의 太平洋艦隊를 전멸시키고, 다시 적의 공군력의 太半을 挫折시켜서 太平洋의 制海, 制空權을 완전히 장악한 것은 忠勇無比의 我皇軍將兵의 肉彈血戰에 있었음을 삼가 감사를 드리는 바이며,  肇國이래 처음인 이 聖戰의 必勝을 持輯하여 半島민중의 결의를 굳게 하고, 및 銃後國民의 의무를 다하도록 너나없이 힘쓰사이다.\n\n高橋 朝鮮軍參謀長과 朝鮮海軍武官府의 黑木 大佐의 「大東亞戰爭必勝」의 講演速記를 비롯하여, 國民總力朝鮮聯盟 主催의 「決戰大演說會」의 尹致昊氏 이하 五氏의 연설과 朝鮮臨戰報國團 主催의 「米英打倒大演說會」의 呂運弘氏 이하 六氏의 연설을 실로 근래에 드물게 보는 愛國熱血의 大獅子吼로서 전 半島민중에게 던지는 巨彈이라고 생각하나이다.\n\n錦上添花로 문예에 있어서 春園이하 四氏의 「太平洋戰爭詩特輯」은 戰時下 좋은 收擭이라 자신하나이다. 그 외에도 梧材升雨氏의 「臺灣 及 中支視察記」를 비롯하여 經濟檢事 姜仲仁氏의 「最近의 經濟事犯」도 時局下 유익한 讀物이라 생각하나이다. ＜155-155＞","magazine":"삼천리 第14卷 第1號","date":"1942년 01월 01일","title":"Editor's Postscript"}];
