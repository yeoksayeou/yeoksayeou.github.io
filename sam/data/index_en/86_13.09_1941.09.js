As we mentioned in the invitation, this evening we would like to hear various valuable insights regarding the current housing problem on the peninsula, centering on the newly established \"Chōsen Housing Corporation.\"\nAs you may already know, according to surveys conducted in eighteen cities including Keijō, Heijō, and Seishin, the number of insufficient houses reaches a staggering sixty thousand units. We believe that with the future expansion of production and the rise of industry, this housing shortage for laborers will become increasingly severe, adding to the importance of the housing issue. Also, looking at it from another perspective, current housing has many deficiencies in terms of air defense and fire prevention, and we wish to swiftly remodel these existing houses into complete dwellings with defensive capabilities suitable for wartime.\nWe sincerely hope you will share your extensive knowledge on these points today.\nFinally, I would like to express my deep gratitude to the Cultural Department of the National Mobilization League, particularly Director Yanabe and Counselor Tanaka, who, from the standpoint of lifestyle culture—that is, how to widely provide comfortable housing for the people's health and daily life—have paid close attention to this issue and provided cordial guidance for today's <14> roundtable meeting.\nNow, I would like to ask Director Yanabe for a few words of greeting. Also, although it might be troublesome, I would like to ask Counselor Tanaka of the League to moderate the discussion.\n\nPeninsula Housing and Japanization\n\nYanabe, Cultural Director (President, Nakagawa Mining) — Thank you truly for today. I also extend my heartfelt thanks forわざわざ (wazawaza - taking the trouble) coming despite the heat.\nActually, the Samch’ŏlli company had the idea to hold a roundtable discussion focusing on the housing problem centered around the newly established Housing Corporation and widely convey it to the people of the peninsula. Believing it to be a very timely and good initiative, the Cultural Department of the League acted as an intermediary to arrange today's event.\nWell, no matter how you put it, the land to cultivate, the clothes to wear, and the dwelling to live in are the three most crucial things for human life. Among these, today's housing problem holds extremely significant meaning. Under the current emergency situation, Chōsen, as a logistical base for the war effort, is experiencing a large concentration of laborers in cities. Providing stable housing for these laborers directly aids in the expansion of production capacity. Therefore, at a time when we must strive even harder to alleviate the housing shortage, especially in strategic industrial zones, the emergence of the Housing Corporation with its plan to build 20,000 new houses is truly a matter for celebration for the peninsula.\nAlso, recently, mountains and rivers throughout Chōsen have been significantly developed, completely changing the landscape. However, when looking specifically at the housing of the peninsula's inhabitants, it remains largely unchanged, showing little sign of progress. It is truly regrettable <15> that amidst this drastic cultural evolution, only housing, in its style and living patterns, has clung stubbornly to old traditions.\nThe other day, I visited a small city in Kōkaidō. I was impressed to see that the residences of the inhabitants in that newly developed area had been completely renewed, filled with \"new-style housing.\" They weren't expensive, nor particularly elaborate, just ordinary peninsula dwellings, but I was surprised at how they extensively incorporated Japanese styles, appearing visibly hygienic, healthy, and moreover, air-defense-ready. I wish this kind of housing would become widespread.\nThis example shows that with good leadership, the improvement of existing housing is certainly possible. Building houses is necessary, but determining *what kind* of house to build is even more crucial.\nToday, authorities from various fields have gathered, so please discuss these points thoroughly.\nCounselor Tanaka — Well then, let's begin addressing the main issue. First, could Director Yamada please give us an overview of the Housing Corporation? Just for reference, the sponsoring magazine \"Samch’ŏlli\" has been published for thirteen years, making it the oldest on the peninsula with a wide readership. Furthermore, its pages are half in Japanese (國語) and half in Korean script (諺文), possessing numerous readers among both Japanese and Koreans. Therefore, your discussions here today will be conveyed to both Japanese and Koreans, so feel free to discuss the housing issues concerning both groups.\n\nToward Naisen Ittai Through Housing\n\nConstruction Manager Nagasato — The Chōsen Housing Corporation Ordinance was promulgated on June 14th, as I believe you all saw in the newspapers. Political Affairs Superintendent Ōno made a statement to the effect of, 'Achieve Naisen Ittai (內鮮一體 - Japan-Korea Unification/Integration) through housing.' This is a very important statement. Current housing, from its style to the way people live in it, shows a stark gap between Japanese and Koreans. I believe it would be deceitful if we didn't strive to bring them as close together as possible, towards the same style and the same mode of living. I want to state beforehand that we intend to proceed with this work with this spirit.\nNext, regarding new housing construction, we have funds of 8 million yen, and we will issue 80 million yen in housing bonds, so we will be working with nearly 100 million yen. We plan to build 5,000 units per year, totaling 20,000 units over four years. Furthermore, besides just the construction and management of these houses ■■■ [text obscured/missing], we are also set to undertake the contracting of housing construction and management, financing, management of renewal facilities in collective housing areas, and related auxiliary businesses.\nBy doing so, we want to provide stable housing to the rapidly increasing number of laborers, aim for the expansion of production capacity, and thereby fulfill the mission of the peninsula as a logistical base.\nOf course, 20,000 houses are far from sufficient. We sincerely hope for the vigorous efforts of various entrepreneurs.\nCounselor Tanaka — From Director Yamada's talk just now <16>, we have learned the spirit and business policy of the Corporation in detail. So, what specific actions are you taking immediately? Also, what kind of \"rational housing\" is the Housing Corporation considering? Mr. Nagasato, please...\n\nBuilding 5,000 Livable Homes\n\nNagasato Eiji (Corporation Construction Manager) — Alright, I will talk about the actual work of the Corporation. The target is to provide cheap housing to general laborers and the common classes. First, by March of next year:\nKeijō: 2,700 units\nHeijō: 1,500 units\nSeishin: 800 units\nIn total, 5,000 units will be constructed. The houses to be built are divided into five types: Kō (甲), Otsu (乙), Hei (丙), Tei (丁), and Bo (戊). The building area is 20 tsubo for Kō, 15 tsubo for Otsu, 10 tsubo for Hei, 8 tsubo for Tei, and 6 tsubo for Bo. All are wooden, tile-roofed, single-story buildings, with the lot size being about three times the building area, making them ideal homes. The distribution ratio of new housing in the three cities of Keijō, Heijō, and Seishin is as follows (Photo shows the roundtable scene):\nKeijō City: Kō type 540 units, Otsu type 810 units, Hei type 540 units, Tei type 405 units, Bo type 405 units. ▲Heijō City: Kō type 300 units, Otsu type 450 units, Hei type 300 units, Tei type 225 units, Bo type 225 units. ▲Seishin City: Kō type 160 units, Otsu type 240 units, Hei type 160 units, Tei type 120 units, Bo type 120 units.\nAmong these, the Kō type will be built as houses for sale (分讓家屋). A method will be adopted where 20% of the initial construction cost is paid upfront, and the remainder is paid in the form of rent. The Otsu type will also be offered for sale to those who wish to buy, and as rental housing (借家) for those who wish to rent. The Hei, Tei, and Bo types will all be rental housing. The point where Housing Corporation houses differ from general housing is the attention paid to welfare facilities during construction. For example, ensuring every house receives sunlight for at least four hours a day and having a large yard. Additionally, for the units in the Seishin and Heijō areas, as a rule, one room with Ondol (溫突 - Korean underfloor heating) will be built.\nFor the Keijō portion, half will have Ondol and half will not. Furthermore, there are plans to establish communal bathhouses, communal plazas, assembly halls, etc., for approximately every fifty housing units. Currently, land acquisition is underway in Heijō and Seishin. In Keijō, about 70% of the land has been secured, mainly in the Eitōho and Roryōshin areas, with prospects of finalizing the remaining land <17> acquisition soon. In Keijō, considering the convenience of urban residents, several apartment buildings (アパート) will also be constructed.\nIn this case, it will be calculated as gathering several units of the Kō, Otsu, Hei, Tei, and Bo types in one place. Furthermore, since construction materials have already been purchased in Manchukuo, construction will begin as soon as land acquisition procedures and zoning are completed and materials arrive. If things proceed smoothly, people should be able to move into new, comfortable homes by early November this autumn.\nCounselor Tanaka — So, for laborers or people from the common classes who want to move into the Corporation's housing, how much rent would they have to pay?\nConstruction Manager Nagasato — Since we target people below the middle class, we want to keep the rent at around 10% of their total income. Currently, people generally spend about 20% of their income on housing expenses, which is unreasonable. Therefore, for the Corporation's housing, we want to make it possible to manage with monthly rents of around 20 yen, 15 yen, or 10 yen. To achieve this, we first need to acquire land costing about 25 yen per tsubo. So, in Keijō, it would be slightly outside the city center, which is why we decided on the vicinity of Roryōshin. Next, looking at the extent of the current housing shortage, these are statistics from the end of fiscal year Shōwa 14 (1939). It is thought to be even worse now.\nKeijō: 563 units per 1,000 households\nFuzan: 460 units per 1,000 households\nJinsen: 998 units per 1,000 households\nIn other words, in a place like Fuzan, an average of 2.5 households live in one unit. We must somehow alleviate this housing shortage.\nCounselor Tanaka — Then, what will the exterior appearance of the houses be like?\nConstruction Manager Nagasato — Everything will be in the Japanese style (內地式). There are various opinions in society: should they be purely Japanese style, a Japanese-Korean hybrid style (內鮮折衷式), or the conventional Korean style (朝鮮式)? However, since we want to realize the ideal of Naisen Ittai (內鮮一體) through housing, we have decided to make all housing for peninsula inhabitants Japanese style. That is, the exterior will be entirely Japanese style, while internally, we want to incorporate some of their customs and traditions, such as building a Korean-style kitchen (台所) or installing Ondol (溫突). <18>\nCounselor Tanaka — What about the allocation for occupants?\nManager Nagasato — Speaking of Keijō:\nFor Japanese (內地人): 2,700 units\nFor Koreans (朝鮮人): 7,100 units [Translator's Note: This number seems incorrect based on the earlier total of 2,700 for Keijō. It might be a typo in the original text, or perhaps refers to a different allocation plan not fully detailed earlier.]\nThe Corporation wants to build ideal homes where everyone can live conveniently, even if it means taking a loss, after thorough research.\n\nReform of Conventional Housing\n\nCounselor Tanaka — Regarding the improvement of Chōsen housing, Mr. Pak (朴樣), please point out the shortcomings of conventional housing and discuss your ideal plan for the future.\nPak Kilyong (Chōsen Architecture Association, Designer) — As Mr. Yanabe mentioned earlier, it is truly puzzling why, despite the progress in various cultural artifacts, only Korean housing has adhered to the old ways. To put it simply, even looking at the newly built houses in Keijō's Ton'ganchō, Meirin'chō, etc., they are far from being cultural or rational, unchanged from the conventional style. The roof tiles may have changed, and materials like wood might have altered somewhat, but the content hasn't progressed one bit. There is a lack of concept regarding housing improvement. Tradition and custom may be important, but they are tradition and custom that exist for the sake of living. Isn't it true that progress in human society only occurs when there is a corresponding breaking of tradition in order to lead a better life?\nConventional housing pays no attention to ventilation and lighting, has defects in insulation systems, uses excessive amounts of wood, lacks standardized measurements, and so on. Therefore, I hope that while perhaps leaving the customary Ondol (溫突) as it is, a major reform will be undertaken with determination to improve Chōsen housing.\nDirector Yanabe (Cultural Department) — There are indeed shortcomings. Then, more concretely, how can they be rationalized?\nPak Kilyong (Architecture Association) — Those heavy Korean roof tiles prevent two-story houses. The building materials are also unnecessarily large in volume, making the exterior look heavy and closed-off, and internally, the layout lacks flexibility. The form lacks variability and is planar. Consequently, there is no integration of dining room, kitchen, toilet, entrance hall, bedroom, study, children's room, reception room, etc.\nThen there is the issue of Ondol (溫突). Ondol consumes an enormous amount of firewood, and furthermore, because residents tend to stay confined near the Ondol, they become lethargic, lazy, and inefficient. While it might be acceptable for the Housing Corporation to build Ondol in places with severe cold like northern Chōsen, I hope they will abolish it in the southern regions.\nIn conclusion, shouldn't we aim for a Japanese style (和風), add improvements to the housing, and perhaps preserve traditional Chōsen housing like museum pieces?\n\nApartments for the Cities\n\nAsakawa Hakukyō (Cultural Department Counselor, Artisan) — Looking at literature, the style of current Japanese housing initially entered Honshū from Kyūshū and became nationwide. It probably spread from Paekche or Ko<19>guryŏ along with other cultural artifacts. However, its transformation into the current open, bright, and active style occurred within the last hundred years.\nAs evidence, Japanese houses used to have women's quarters (婦人部屋), which closely resemble the women's rooms of Paekche and Koguryŏ.\nBut is it appropriate to switch immediately to Japanese style now? Don't even young people who went to Japan and graduated from vocational schools or universities find Korean-style housing comfortable? Rather than immediately making Koreans wear Japanese clothes or live in purely Japanese-style houses, which feels somewhat unnatural, perhaps it's better to allow for flexibility. Just as young people prefer to wear active Western clothes and live in cultural apartments (アパート), a rational, Japanese-style-based housing type might emerge naturally. How about making it adaptable like that?\nDirector Yanabe — Naturally, the number of apartment dwellers will increase in urban areas. It's good from the perspective of simplifying and rationalizing life for several small families to live utilizing common gardens, communal baths, communal kitchens, communal childcare centers, communal exercise rooms, etc. However, large families might find apartments inconvenient.\nConstruction Manager Nagasato — That's quite right. Therefore, we plan to build apartments as much as possible in cities.\nShirayama (Samch’ŏlli) — In Germany, for example, apartments are generally four stories high. Upon entering the entrance, there's a large common garden in the courtyard. Six families line up on the left and right in four rows, meaning twenty-four families on one floor. A single four-story building houses a total of ninety-six families living communally. This is said to be very effective for collectively training the nation's people. Also, it seems housing for laborers is almost exclusively apartment-style.\n\nImplementing Six Points\n\nCounselor Tanaka (Cultural Department) — Mr. Ogiwara, please...\nOgiwara Kōichi (Government-General Engineer) — Chōsen housing can be classified into three types:\n1.  Northern Chōsen style\n2.  Central Chōsen style\n3.  Southern Chōsen style\nAncient Japanese housing traces its lineage from Northern Chōsen. This can be seen, for example, in the architectural style of the \"Grand Shrine of Ise\" (伊勢の大神宮), and also in folk houses remaining in the countryside today. However, Japanese housing underwent repeated improvements, was influenced by Buddhism, passed through the Nara and Kamakura periods, and has now developed into respectable, fine housing. But the Korean counterpart has truly not progressed at all for thousands of years since then. Earlier, Mr. Pak advocated for drastic improvement at this juncture, and I completely agree. Therefore, to reform the conventional style and create new national housing now:\n1.  Eradicate superstition\n2.  Standardize measurements\n3.  Improve floor plans (lighting, ventilation, interior rooms, kitchen, toilet, closets, etc.)\n4.  Conserve materials (current ones use double the wood<20>)\n5.  Ensure adequate lot space\n6.  Train skilled workers\nBy implementing these points, we should make housing an important incubator for the second generation of citizens, making it healthy and hygienic. We want to quickly create housing where life can be enjoyed.\nShirayama (Samch’ŏlli) — During the Great Kantō Earthquake in Tokyo, I witnessed firsthand how wooden houses turned into a burnt field overnight. Based on that experience, I have the impression that Japanese-style houses are vulnerable to fire. From the perspective of fire prevention, which is more effective, Japanese style or Korean style? Also, regarding the lifespan of houses, how do they compare?\nConstruction Manager Nagasato — Even for wooden construction, from now on, we will mainly use fire-resistant timber (耐火木材). Fire-resistant timber is wood injected deep with non-combustible chemicals like ammonium phosphate and magnesium sulfate, characterized by releasing non-flammable gas and not catching fire. Therefore, it is safe from a fire-prevention standpoint.\nPak Kilyong — Regarding lifespan, Korean houses often start leaning after two or three years. This is due to inadequate ground leveling and also because the volume and weight of the wood, etc., are two and a half times greater, causing them to tilt quickly and shorten their lifespan.\nEngineer Ogiwara — It seems that if an Ondol (溫突) is built carefully, it can last about ten years.\n\nThe Working Class and Rent\n\nShirayama (Samch’ŏlli) — I hear that President Hitler promised to provide six million modern-style houses to the nation, actually built them, and offered them first to the working class. Currently, laborers generally pay 20% to 25% of their income as rent, but he says he will eventually lower it to 10% to 13%. Indeed, every country takes the housing problem very seriously.\nConstruction Manager Nagasato — That's true. At our Corporation too, our ideal is to provide housing with rents of about 10 to 12 or 13 yen for those below the middle class, say, those with incomes below 100 yen per month, perhaps around 70 or 80 yen. Fortunately, we can use low-interest funds at 3.5%, so even if we take a loss, we definitely want to achieve this.\nLooking at foreign examples, Britain doesn't pay much attention to slum areas, but Germany puts effort into it. The reason they can generate such labor power is likely due to the thoroughness of worker protection through housing.\nShirayama (Samch’ŏlli) — Lastly, a request to the Corporation. I hear that in Japan proper (內地), there is a five-year plan to build 300,000 houses. We earnestly request that Chōsen also increase its housing stock and accommodate a large number of laborers under new, good designs.\nCounselor Tanaka — Thank you all very much for your valuable insights over this long period. Let's conclude here. — (End) — <21>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis 1941 roundtable discussion, hosted by Samch’ŏlli magazine and the National Mobilization League, focuses on the housing shortage in colonial Korea and the establishment of the Chōsen Housing Corporation (朝鮮住宅營團). The Corporation, led by Yamada Chūji, aims to build 20,000 homes over four years, primarily targeting laborers in cities like Keijō, Heijō, and Seishin, to support wartime industrial production. A key theme is promoting *Naisen Ittai* (Japan-Korea Unification) by encouraging Koreans to adopt Japanese-style housing, although concessions like including Ondol rooms are discussed. Panelists criticize traditional Korean houses for poor lighting, ventilation, material inefficiency, and contributing to laziness (due to Ondol), advocating for rationalized, Japanese-style or apartment living. Rent affordability for lower-income groups is also a stated goal.\nFrom a historical perspective, the article is revealing about colonial assimilation policies extending into domestic life and architecture, explicitly linking housing style to the *Naisen Ittai* ideology. It highlights the state's focus on managing the labor force for wartime production through housing provision. The criticisms leveled against traditional Korean architecture and lifestyles by both Japanese officials and a Korean architect (Pak Kilyong) offer insight into the prevailing attitudes towards Korean culture within the colonial power structure and among some assimilated Koreans.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n山田忠次\tやまだ ちゅうじ\tYamada Chūji\n長鄕衛二\tながさと えいじ\tNagasato Eiji\n荻原孝一\tおぎわら こういち\tOgiwara

白山靑樹\n\n白山靑樹(本社)―署い最中を御出で下さいまして誠に有難く存じます、御案内申上げた通り、今夕は新たに生れた「朝鮮住宅營團」を中心に現下の半島に於ける住宅問題に就いて、色々と有益な御話しを伺ひ度う御座います。\n旣に御存知のことゝ思ひますが、今日京城を始め平壤、淸津等十八ケ都市に就いて調査して見ましても、不足住宅の數、實に六萬戶の多きに及び、今後生産擴充産業の勃興に伴ひ勞務者に對するこれ等の住宅不足は益々劇しくなるものと思ひまして住宅問題の重要性は益々加はるでありましようし、又他の一面から眺むれば、現在の住宅には防空上、防火上、缺陷も多くあるものと思ひ速かに之等の在來住宅を戰時に適はしき防禦力のある完全な住宅に改造致し度いもので御座います。\n何卒之等の點に就いて、平素の蘊蓄を傾け充分御話し願ひ度う存じます。\n終りに總力聯盟文化部に於かれてはこの外にも尙、生活文化の立場より即ち如何にすれは、國民の保健上生活上、快適な住居を大衆へ廣く提供しようかとの立場より、非常に深くこの問題に意を注がれ、本日のこ＜14＞の座談會の催しにも矢鍋部長、田中參事より懇ろな御指導を下さいましたことを厚く御禮申上げます。\nそれでは矢鍋部長より、御拶挨旁々御言葉を頂き度う御座います。尙進行は御苦勞でしようが、聯盟の田中參事に何卒御願ひ致します。\n\n半島住宅と和風化\n\n矢鍋文化部長(中川鑛業社長)―今日は本當に有難う御座いました、署い折りわざわざ御出で下さいまして、私からも厚く御禮申上げます。\n實は三千里社の方で、今度新たに生れた住宅營團を中心に住宅問題に就いて座談會を開いて、それを半島民衆へ廣く傳へる御意見であつたので、非常に時宜に適した良い企てと思ひ聯盟の文化部で、斡旋をし本日の催を致した次第であります。\nまあ、何んと云ふても耕す土地と着る衣服と住ふ住居の三つは、人間生活に最も大事なものでありますが其の中でも、今日の住宅問題は非常に大きな意義を含んで居りまして、何しろ事變下兵站基地としての朝鮮では、勞務者の都市集中が多くなりそれ等勞務者へ安住の住宅を提供するのが、とりもなほさず、生産力擴充の助けになる實情にありますので何を措いても時局産業地帶に於ては住宅難の緩和に一層懸命にならねばならぬ時、此處に二萬戶の新築案を提げて、住宅營團が生れ出たことは、半島の爲め慶賀に堪えませぬ。\n又最近朝鮮は到る處、山や川が非常に開拓され、面目を一新して居りますけれども、ひとり半島人側の住宅を見るとき、舊態依然として餘り進歩の跡が見えませぬ、この劇しい文物進化の中に居つて、住宅のみが樣式なり、生活態度が古き傳統を固執して來たことは、實に慨はしい次＜15＞第であります。\n私は先日黄海道のある小都市に往つて見ましたが、新開拓地であるそこの住民たちの住居が面目を一新して「新らしい型の住宅」で滿たされたのに感心しました、金を掛けたのでもなし、別に凝つたのでもなし普通の半島人の住宅でしたが、內地式を大いに取入れ實に見るからに衛生的、健康的にして、しかも防空的なのには驚きました。こういふ住宅が一般に普及されて欲しいのです。\nこの例を見ても、よき指導者さへ居れば在來住宅の改良は、大いに出來る筈です、家を建てるのも必要でしようが、如何なる家を建てるべきかはより一層必要です。\n今日は各方面の權威の方々が、御集り下さつたから、どうか充分にこれ等の點に就き、御話しを願ひ度う御座います。\n田中參事―ではこれから本問題に取掛ります。先づ住宅營團のあらましに就いて、山田團長から何卒御話し願ひます、一寸ここ御で參考迄に申上げますが、主催の「三千里」と云ふ雜誌は創刊十三ケ年に及ぶ、半島では最も古く又廣汎な讀者層を持つて居り、しかも誌面は國語半分、諺文半分となつて居り、内鮮人共に多數の讀者層を持つてゐる、有名な雜誌であります故、皆樣の今席の御話しは内鮮兩方へ傳はることになりますから、内鮮兩方の住宅問題に就いて御話願ふて結搆で御座います。\n\n住宅を通じて內鮮一體へ\n\n長鄕建設部長 ―朝鮮住宅營團令は六月十四日附で公布されたので、皆樣も新聞紙上で旣に御覽になつたことと思ひますが、大野政務總監よりから云ふ御話しがありました、つまり『住宅を通じて內鮮一體を計れ』と、これは非常に大事な御話しで今の住宅はその樣式から住み方から、內鮮人間に間隔が激しい、それをなる丈け一所にして同じ型の、同じ生活樣式に迄進ましむる樣にしなけれげ噓だと思ひます。私等はこういふ氣持で、この仕事を進めて行くことを豫め申上げ度い。\nそれから住宅新築のことになりますが、資金八百萬圓、それに八千寓圓の住宅債券を出して、まあ一億近い金で仕事をやりますが、一ケ年五千戶宛四ケ年二萬戶を建てます、又之等住宅の建設經營のみ■■■、住宅の建築並に經營の受託、資金の融通、又は集團住宅地の更生施設の經營とそれ等の附帶事業をも、經營することになつて居ります。\nさうして急激に增加しつゝある勞務者へ安住の住居を與へ、生産力擴充を計つて兵站基地半島の使命を完うさせたいものです。\nもとより二萬戶程度の、住宅では大いに足りませぬ、各企業家諸氏の奮起を望んで止まないのであります\n田中叅事―今の山田團長の御話しで＜16＞營團の精神や事業方針等を詳しく承りましたが、それでは今直ちにどう云ふことをおやりになるのですか、又住宅營團の方で考へて居る「合理的住宅」とはどういふものでしようか、長鄕さん何卒……。\n\n\n\n住み良き五千戸を\n\n長鄕衛二(營團建設部長)―それでは營團の實際の仕事のことを申上げます、目當は一般の勞務者と庶民階級へ安い住宅を提供することなのですが、先づ來年の三月迄に\n京城 二千七百戶\n平壤 一千五百戶\n淸津 八百戶\nつまり五千戶を建設します。その建築する家は、甲乙丙丁戍の五種に分けられ建坪甲は廿坪、乙は十五坪、丙は十坪、丁は八坪、戍は六坪でいづれも木材、瓦葺平家建で敷地は建坪の約三倍といふ理想的な家で、京城、平壤、淸津三府に建つ新住宅の割合は(寫眞は座談會光景)\n京城府甲型五四○戶、乙型八一○戶、丙型五四○戶、丁型戍型共に四○五戶▲平壤府甲型三○○戶、乙型四五○戶、丙型三○○戶、丁型戍型共に二二五戶▲淸津府甲型一六○戶、乙型二四○戶、丙型一六○戶、丁型戍型共に一二○戶\nとなつてゐます。このうち甲型は分讓家屋として建てられ最初建築費の二割を一時拂込みとし殘額を家賃の形式で、拂込むといつた方法をとり乙型も分讓希望者には分讓し借家希望者には借家として提供します、丙、丁、戍の三種は全部借家とします、住宅營團の家が一般住宅と相違する點は厚生施設に留意して建築してあることで例へばどんな家でも一日四時間以上日光が射すこと庭が廣いことなどだがこのほか淸津、平壤方面の分は原則として溫突を一間造ります\n京城の分は溫突のあるものとないものと半々にし、このほか住宅約五十戶を單位に共同浴場共同廣場集會所などを設置する豫定となつてゐます、目下平壤淸津は土地を買收するまでになつてをり、京城は永登浦、鷺梁津方面のみで約七割の敷地を確定、殘餘の敷地も早急に取決める見＜17＞込が立つてゐますが京城では都市居住者の便宜を老慮してアパートを數戶建てます。\nこの場合は甲乙丙丁戊五型の數戶分を一ケ所に集めたことに計算されるなほ建築資材は滿洲國で旣に、買付けも終つてゐるので、敷地の買收手續き區割りの濟み次第資材を人荷して建築に着手するといふから、順調にゆけば今秋十一月初めには新らしい住み心地の良い家に入れることゝなりましよう。\n田中叅事―さうすると勞務者とか庶民階級の人々が、營團の住宅に入らうとなるとどれ程の家賃を出すことになるのですか。\n長鄕建設部長―中流以下の人々を對象とします故、全收入の一割內外の家賃を出す程度に止め度いのです、今は大抵の場合收入の二割程度を住宅費に人れますが之れは無理ですな それで營團の住宅では、月々二十圓か十五圓、十圓程度の家賃で濟ます樣にしたいものです。それには土地が先づ坪二十五圓程度のを得なければなりませんから、京城なら少し市外になりますが、鷺梁津附近に定めた譯です、それから今どれ丈け住宅難になやまされて居るかを見ると、之は昭和十四年度末の統計であります。今はもつとひどくなつたと思はれますが\n京城 千世帶に對し 五六三戶\n釜山 同 四六○\n仁川 同 九九八\n戶です、つまり釜山の如きは一戶に就き平均二世帶半が住んで居ることになります、何んとかしてこの住宅難を、緩和したいものですな。\n田中叅事―では住宅の外貌はどんなものになりますか。\n長鄕建設部長―凡て內地式になります、世間では色々の議論があります純內地式にすべきか、內鮮折衷式にすべきか、在來の朝鮮式住宅にすべきかと、しかし住宅を通じて內鮮一體の理想を實現致したいのですから半島人の住居も凡て內地式にすることに決めました、つまり外形は凡て內地式とし、內部に於て朝鮮式の台所を造るとか、溫突を入れるとか、幾分かその習性と傳統を取入れたいと＜18＞思ひます。\n田中叅事―収容する割當は？\n長鄕部長―京城のことを申せば\n內地人 二千七百戶\n朝鮮人 七千百戶\nを造ります。營團では損をしてもよく硏究して、お互ひ不便のない樣な理想的な住宅を造り上げ度いのです。\n\n在來住宅の改革\n\n田中叅事―朝鮮住宅の改良に就いて朴樣何卒在來住宅の缺陷の指摘と將來への理想案を御話して下さいませ\n朴吉龍(朝鮮建築會、設計家)先程矢鍋樣からも御話しがありましたが、諸有文物が進歩して來たのに、何故朝鮮人の住宅のみが舊態を墨守して來たか不思議でなりませぬ、早い話しが新らしく建てられた、京城の敦岩町明倫町等の住宅を見ても文化的とか合理的とかとは緣遠く在來式と變つて居ませぬ、瓦が變り木材等材料は幾分變つたでしようが、內容は一寸も進步して居ませぬ、住宅向上に對する觀念が足らないのですな、傳統と習性は大事でしようが、それは生活あつての傳統と習性であつて、よりよき生活を營まんが爲には、それ相應の傳統の打破があつて始めて人類社會の進步があるのちやないでしようか。\n在來住宅は通風、採光に留意せず保溫裝置にも缺陷があり、木材の過用、尺度の不統一、等多くあります ですから、習性である溫突をその儘置くに止めて思ひ切つて、大改革を加へて朝鮮住宅の改良を目論して欲しいと思ひます。\n矢鍋部長(文化部)―缺陷がありますね、ではもつと具體的にとうすれば合理化になるでしようか。\n朴吉龍(建築協會)―朝鮮のあの重たい瓦が二階屋を防げるのです、用材も容積が不必要に大きく爲めに外觀から見て重苦しく、密閉的であり内容に於て聞取の融通が聽きませぬ、型に變化性がなく、平面的であります。從つて食堂、臺所、便所、玄關 寢室、書齋、兒童室、應接間等の統一が取れて居ませぬ。\nそれから溫突の問題になりますが溫突の爲めに薪の消費が夥しく、しかも溫突に蟄居するから住民が無氣力、懶惰、非能率的になります、住宅營團の方では、北鮮の如き寒氣甚しき處では溫突を造るのもよいでしよが南鮮地方には廢止して欲しいと思ひます。\n結論から云へば和風を目指し、住宅に改良を加ふべく、さうして朝鮮住宅は紀念品みたいに殘すべきではないでしようか。\n\n都會へはアパートを\n\n淺川伯敎(文化部參事 工藝家)―文獻を見ますれば今の内地住宅の樣式は始め九州から本州へ入つて、全國的になつたものであり、多分有濟や高＜19＞句麗から他の文物と同樣に、傳つたのぢやないでしようか、それが現在の樣な開放的で明朗で活動的な樣式になつたのは、百年以內のことだつたのです。\nその證據には内地住宅に婦人部屋と云ふのがありましたが、これ等は百濟、高麗の女部屋と良く似て居ますね。\nしかし今直ちに和風にするのはどうですかね、內地に往つて專門學校大舉を卒へて來た若い人達も、朝鮮式住宅を心易く思ふのぢやないですか、それよりも今直ちに朝鮮人に內鮮服を着させるのも、朝鮮人に純內地式住宅に住まはせるのも、聊か不自然な點があるのですから、寧ろ若い人たちが好んで活動的な洋服を着 文化的なアパートに住む樣に、自然と何にか合理的な和風本位住宅型が生れるでしようから、その樣に融通のきく樣にしたらどうですかな。\n矢鍋部長―都會地には自然アパート生活者が增へましような、幾つもの小家族が公共庭園とか共同浴室、共同炊事室、共同育兒ホーム、共同運動室などを、利用しながら生活するのは生活の簡易化、生活の合理化の上からいいですね、但大家族になるとアパートぢや困るでしようね。\n長鄕建設部長―御尤です、それで都市では可丈けアパートも建てる積りです。\n白山(本社)獨逸などではアパートは大槪四階建て入口へ入つたら中庭に大きな共同庭園があり、左右に六家族づゝ四列に並んで一階に二十四家族 四階一棟に實に九十六家族が集合して、共同生活をするさうですが、集團的に國民を訓練する上からも非常によいさうです。又勤勞者への住宅は殆んどアパート式に定つて居るらしいですね。\n\n六個條を斷行\n\n田中參事(文化部)―萩原樣何卒‥‥\n荻原孝一(總督府技師)―朝鮮住宅は三種に分類することが出來ますがそれは\n一、北鮮式 二、中鮮式 三、南鮮式\nです、日本太古の住宅は北鮮から系統を引いて居ります、例へば「伊勢の大神宮」の建築樣式を見ても、又今田舍に殘つて居る民家に見るもさうです、しかし內地の住宅はそれから改良に改良を加へ、そこへ佛敎の影響は受けるし、奈良時代、鎌食時代を經て今ははづかしくない、立派な住宅に迄仕上げたのですが、朝鮮の方はあれから實に何千年來ちつとも進步して居ません、先程、朴樣も此際思ひ切つて改良說を唱へたが全く私も共鳴します。それで今在來式を改革し新しい國民住宅を造るには\n一、迷信の打破\n二、尺度の統一\n三、間取改良(採光、通風、內房炊事場、便所押入等)\n四、資材節約(今のは木材が倍か＜20＞かつて居る)\n五、敷地の餘裕\n六、職工の養成\nこれだけのことを斷行して、住宅をば大事な第二國民の産室たらしめ、保健、衛生的にしたいものです。生活を樂しめる住宅に一日も早くしたいものですな。\n白山(本社)―私は東京震災の時 木造家屋が一夜にして、燒野原になる有樣を目のあたり、見て來た經驗があつて内地式は火災にはもろいと云ふ印象を持つて居ますが、この防火と云ふ點からすれは內地式と、朝鮮式とどつちが効果的ですか、それから家屋の壽命から云へはその比較はとういふ樣になるのですか。\n長鄕建設部長―木村建築にしても之からのは皆耐火木材を主に使ひます。耐火木材と云ふのは燐酸アムモニア、硫酸マグネシウム等燃えない藥劑を木材の心に注入したもので、不燃性瓦斯を出して發焰しない特徴があります。ですから防火的に見て安全です。\n朴吉龍―壽命のことは朝鮮家屋は二三年すれば皆柱が傾きます、それは地均しが充分でないのと、又木材等容積と重さが二倍半もあるので、直ぐ傾斜して壽命が短くなつてしまふのです。\n荻原技師―溫突は丁寧に造れば十年位保つさうですね。\n\n勤勞階級と家賃\n\n白山(本社)聞きますればヒツトラ總統は國民に六百萬戶の近代式住宅を提供すると約束し、事實建設して勤勞階級から先へ提供して居るさうで現在は勞務者階級が、大槪收入の二割乃至二割五分の家賃を出して居るが將來は一割乃至一割三分程度に引下げて見せると言ひますが、實際どこの國も住宅問題には重大な關心を持つて居りますね。\n長鄕建設部長―それはさうですね、私等の營團の方でも中産階級以下即ち月給百圓以下の、まあ七八十圓收入の方々へは家賃十圓から十二三圓程度の家を提供するのが理想なのです、幸ひ三分五厘の低利資金を使へますから、損をしても是非さうしたいものですね。\n外國の例を見ても英國は細民街に考慮をあまり拂はないけれども、獨逸は力を入れて居ますね、あれだけの勞働力を産み出して居るのはやはり、住宅を通しての勞働者保護が徹底してゐるせいですね。\n白山(本社)―最後に營團へ御願ひ致します、內地では五個年計劃で三十萬戶を建てるさうです、何卒朝鮮も住宅を增やし、新らしい良い設計の下に多數の勤勞者を收容させて頂く樣切に御願致します。\n田中參事―何うも長い時間有益な御話を伺ひ有難う御座いました ではこれくらゐで。―(終)―＜21＞\n＜14-21＞","magazine":"三千里 第13巻 第9号","date":"1941년 09월 01일 (September 1, 1941)","title":"[Japanese] The Chosŏn Housing Problem (Roundtable Discussion Welcoming Executives of the

Translation:**\nVisiting Notables in the Cultural Field (4) (Chairman Kanzō of the Broadcasting Association - Discussing the Cultural Exchange between Japan and Korea -)\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSamch'ŏlli Company Woman Reporter\n\nThis time, we visited Mr. Kanzō Gibō, Chairman of the Chōsen Broadcasting Association, at the stylish Broadcasting Association building in Teidō-chō. Having been in Chōsen for twenty years, he is quite knowledgeable about Korea. After serving as Police Chief, Prefectural Governor (Fuin), and Provincial Governor, he assumed his current position and struck me as a very down-to-earth person. Despite such a distinguished career, he is still young, not much over forty. Furthermore, he is a handsome man of smaller build, truly gentle, a gentleman likely to be liked by anyone. Thus, I felt quite at ease and, forgetting it was my first time before him, felt inclined to ask him about everything.\n\nObserving the Progress of Culture on the Peninsula\n\n\"Mr. Kanzō, having been in Chōsen for twenty years, you must be well acquainted with both the old Chōsen and the present Chōsen.\"\n\"Yes, although I've only been in Kyŏngsŏng, Kyŏngsŏng is the heart of Chōsen, a microcosm of Chōsen, so one can understand the whole of Chōsen from here.\"\n\"Please tell us about the cultural improvement comparing Chōsen then and Chōsen now.\"\n\"That goes without saying. There's a huge difference between the Chōsen when I arrived <22> and the Chōsen now. Back then, Chōsen was solely agricultural. It's fair to say that industry was virtually non-existent, rather than just scarce. Yet, industry began to develop, and since 1928 (Shōwa 3), when Mr. Noguchi Jun started building hydroelectric power plants in various places across Chōsen, industry has shown astonishing growth over the past ten years. Compared to 1928, electricity usage has incredibly increased two-hundredfold. Since only a tiny fraction of that electricity is used for things like electric lights and radios, with almost all of it going to industry, it's clear how much industry has developed today without needing to spell it out. With industry developing in this way, culture naturally improves alongside it. It's easy to think of industry and culture as completely separate, but in reality, culture cannot be considered apart from industry. Where there is no industry, there can be no culture. Industry and culture must always be considered and viewed together. Therefore, the culture of Chōsen twenty years ago and Chōsen now are beyond comparison. It's truly wonderful progress. The population has increased, life has become more affluent, and the citizens of Kyŏngsŏng Prefecture alone have managed to save 600 million yen.\"\n\"From an ideological perspective, that must also be the case.\"\n\"Indeed, it's not even a matter of discussing ideology anymore. Phrases like 'Naissen Ittai' (Japan-Korea Unity) or 'Naissen Yūgō' (Japan-Korea Amalgamation) are no longer necessary; we've reached that stage. While people in newspapers, magazines, or perhaps the intellectual class still discuss 'Naissen Ittai' or 'Naissen Yūgō,' deep down, the people of the peninsula have already fully become subjects of the Empire (皇國臣民). They really have.\"\n\nCultural Exchange via Radio\n\n\"Through the radio, wouldn't you promote cultural exchange more broadly, say between Chōsen and the Mainland (Naichi), Chōsen and Manchuria?\"\n\"We are doing so. Since May, we've been collaborating with the Mainland, Manchuria, and North China, and it has been very well received.\"\n\"I am aware of that, but wouldn't you consider doing something special like a 'Cultural Evening' (文化の夕), <23> perhaps a joint broadcast between the Cultural Department of the Taisei Yokusankai (Imperial Rule Assistance Association) on the Mainland and the Cultural Department of the Chōsen Sōryoku Renmei (Korean Federation for Total Mobilization)?\"\n\n\"I don't feel such a need. Activities solely by the Cultural Department aren't necessarily the only way to achieve cultural exchange. The broad-ranging joint broadcasts we are currently doing with the Taisei Yokusankai also contribute to culture...\"\n\"No, that wasn't the meaning behind my suggestion. I was thinking that for the sake of general artists, it would be desirable to have such an event occasionally...\"\n\"Ah, is that so? Doing something like that might be interesting.\"\n\"I think it would be interesting. If there were a joint broadcast featuring artists from various fields here, starting with Mr. Yanabe, the Cultural Director, and poets and novelists from the Mainland, starting with Mr. Kishida, wouldn't it foster a greater sense of intimacy between both sides...?\"\n\"That's true. Perhaps we should try to create such opportunities in the future.\"\n\nGuidance on Popular Songs (Kayō)\n\n\"The Second Broadcasting Department started providing guidance on popular songs (歌謠) around last autumn, didn't it?\"\n\"I believe so.\"\n\"It has been immensely welcomed by ordinary households. Indeed, popular songs (流行歌) were problematic for children's education, and yet there were no suitable good songs, so it was a predicament for families. This was truly a good initiative.\"\n\"Is that so? That's delightful news. Please tell Mr. Ro, the head of the Second Broadcasting Department, as well. Ask him to pursue it vigorously.\"\n\"Also, recently the Second Broadcasting Department has been broadcasting old songs sung by a chorus under the title 'Melodies of Remembrance' (思ひ出の曲), and that too was wonderfully nostalgic and good.\"\n\"Is that so? Please tell them that what is good is good. The broadcasting station operates according to the wishes of the general listeners.\"\n\"I read in the newspaper the other day that in Tōkyō, they held a large gathering of 'Bon Odori Songs' (盆踊の歌) from various regions at a public hall and broadcast it nationwide. Similarly, how about researching Chōsen's folk songs (民謠), or perhaps unique regional songs, <24> those not generally known, and popularizing them through the radio?\"\n\"That is an excellent idea. Excellent indeed. I will tell the person in charge about it.\"\n\nKorean Literature, Art, Dance, Etc.\n\n\"I would like to hear your thoughts on Korean literature...\"\n\"Koreans aren't very skilled at novels, are they? Even older works weren't particularly impressive, and recent ones are much the same. I read all the translated ones, but they were mostly poor. However, there are good poems. There might be good recent ones too, but poems by someone like Yi T'oegye are truly magnificent. It seems Koreans are richer in poetic talent than in novelistic talent.\"\n\"What about art?\"\n\"In art too, the older works are better. Ceramics from the early Yi Dynasty, for example, had astonishingly fine pieces, and paintings from that era are rarely surpassed. Everyone praises Koryŏ celadon (高句麗の磁器 - *Note: reporter likely means Koryŏ celadon, not Koguryŏ*), but I want to rate the early Yi Dynasty ceramics even higher. Works after that period only got progressively worse.\"\n\"Have you seen Korean dance?\"\n\"Yes. Something like 'Puyŏ Hoesanggok' (扶餘回想曲 - Recollections of Puyŏ) was good, truly splendid. I think it was even better because it wasn't purely Korean. It was an amalgamation of Mainland and Chōsen styles. I really want them to do more things like that. Since it's wartime now, we can't just focus on such things, but once the war is over, I'd really like to encourage it.\"\n\nHopes for the Peninsula's People in the Current Situation\n\n\"Do you have any words you'd like to share with the people of the peninsula under the current critical situation?\"\n\"There's no need to specifically label them 'peninsula people.' People of the peninsula are also Japanese. What I hope for all Japanese people is that we move from words to action. Executing something once is incomparably more beneficial to Japan than saying it a hundred times. No matter how much noise the Sōryoku Renmei makes, if it cannot be put into practice, it amounts to nothing. Sending cigarettes to the Imperial Army is fine, but not wasting even a single cigarette is more beneficial to the country. The person who carefully uses one match does far more for the country than the person who just talks about cherishing matches. Therefore, we should just silently act. Without saying anything.\"\n\nHobbies, Reading\n\n\"Mr. Kanzō, what kind of hobbies do you have?\" <25>\n\"Hobbies? I don't have anything specific, but I practice Kendo (擊劒), rowing (ボート), sponge ball (スポンチボール - likely soft tennis), and tennis (テーニス).\"\n\"Which among those do you find most interesting?\"\n\"They are all interesting. I've practiced Kendo since my time as a police officer and continued even when I was a provincial governor.\"\n\"You must be quite skilled then.\"\n\"I'm not very good. Rather poor, actually. I'm only a second dan (二段).\"\n\"Second dan? Isn't that quite something, being next after first dan?\"\n\"It's the opposite. The higher ranks go up, like eighth dan (八段), ninth dan (九段)...\"\n\"Oh, is that so?\"\nBoth laugh for a moment.\n\"What sort of books do you read?\"\n\"I read the Analects (論語). I also read Zen (禪宗) texts. Reading Zen texts and practicing Zen is one of my hobbies.\"\nI finally understood the reason why I couldn't help but perceive Mr. Kanzō, who had been a police officer, prefectural governor, and provincial governor, as having a benevolence almost like that of a Buddha.\n\nBooks Recommended for Peninsula Youth\n\n\"What kind of books would you like the youth of the peninsula to read?\"\n\"The Analects (論語). The Analects teaches excellent governance. It teaches law. Morality, human feelings, everything good in this world, it teaches it all. Everything the Sōryoku Renmei is doing now is in the Analects. 'Cultivate the self, regulate the family, govern the state rightly, bring peace to the world' (修身濟家、治國平天下). Where is there a more splendid teaching than this? Doesn't it speak to the very foundation of everything? How can one govern a country if they cannot cultivate themselves or manage their own household? It is a magnificent teaching. China, being a large country, produced such a great sage. If one reads just this, they come to understand everything. They come to grasp it. You too, please start reading the Analects from today.\"\nI could only nod fervently. The expression on his face as he spoke about the Analects was simply too profound—.

Please look forward to next month's issue. <26>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis 1941 interview features Kanzō Gibō, the Japanese head of the Chōsen Broadcasting Association, discussing cultural progress in colonial Korea. He emphasizes the link between industrial development (spurred by Japanese investment like Noguchi Jun's) and cultural advancement, asserting that Korea has culturally improved significantly under Japanese rule. Kanzō claims Koreans have fully become \"Imperial Subjects\" (皇國臣民), making concepts like \"Naissen Ittai\" (Japan-Korea Unity) practically redundant. He discusses radio's role in cultural exchange, his views on Korean arts (praising poetry and early Yi Dynasty ceramics over novels and later art), and advises Koreans to focus on practical action over words during wartime and to read Confucian classics like the Analects for moral guidance. For historians, the article offers a clear example of Japanese colonial discourse, showcasing the paternalistic view of Korean cultural development, the promotion of assimilationist ideology (\"Naissen Ittai,\" \"Kōkoku Shinmin\"), the selective appreciation of Korean culture that aligns with Japanese aesthetics or interpretations, and the emphasis on Confucianism as a tool for social control and reinforcing loyalty to the Japanese Empire. Kanzō's dismissal of contemporary Korean novels and art while praising older forms or \"amalgamated\" styles is particularly revealing of colonial cultural hierarchies.\n\n**Named

婦人記者\n今度は、朝鮮放送協會長甘蔗義邦氏を貞洞町の瀟洒な放送協會館に御尋ねしました。氏は朝鮮に來られて二十年にもおなりになる朝鮮通のお方でゐらつしやいます。警察部長、府尹、道知事を經て今日の席におつきになりましたとのことで非常に平民的なお方でゐらつしやいました。第一それ程の經歷をお持ちでありながら氏はまだ四十をあまり越えてゐない若さです。それにまた體格の大きくない美男子型の實にやさしい誰にも好かれさうな紳士でした。それで私も大變心安くなつて氏の前に始めてであるのも忘れて氏に對して何もかもお尋ねする氣になつたのでございます。\n\n半島の文化向上の跡を觀る\n\n「甘蔗先生は朝鮮に來られて二十年にもおなりになりますから昔の朝鮮も今の朝鮮もよく御存じてゐらつしやいますでせう。」\n「えゝ、ずつと京城にだけゐましたが京城は朝鮮の心臓、朝鮮の縮圖でありますから朝鮮全體が察せられるわけですね。」\n「その時の朝鮮と今の朝鮮との文化の向上をおつしやつて下さい。」\n「それは云ふにも及びません。私が來た時分の朝鮮と今＜22＞の朝鮮とは大變な差があります。その時分の朝鮮は農業だけでした。工業と云ふものは殆んどと云ふよりも全くなかつたと云つてもいゝ有樣でした。それであつたのに工業が發展する樣になつて昭和三年から野口遵氏が朝鮮各地のいろんな處に水力電氣を起して以來、十年の間工業は恐しい程の發展を見せてゐます。昭和三年度に較べましても二百倍と云ふ驚く程の電力をつかつてゐます。その電力が電燈とかラデオとかかう云ふものには極く僅かに使用されて、その殆んどが工業につかはれてゐますから今日の工業がどれ程發展してゐるかは口に出さなくてもわかります。かう云ふ風に産業が發達してゐますから文化はそれに從つて自然と向上するわけです。産業と文化とは全然別のものの樣に考へやすいものですけれど實は文化は産業を離れては考へられないものです。産業のないところに文化はあり得ないんです。産業と文化は何時もくつつけて考へなければならんし、見なければなりません。でありますから二十年前の朝鮮と今の朝鮮の文化とは比較するにも及ばないでせう。それこそすばらしい發展です。人口も殖えて、生活も裕かになつて京城府民だけで六億の貯蓄が出來る樣になりましたからね。」\n「思想上から見てもさうで御ざいませう。」\n「さうですとも、思想を云々するところぢやありません。内鮮一體とか内鮮融合とか云ふ文句はもう必要でない階段に來て居ますよ、それは新聞雜誌の人々とか或は知識階級の人々の中には今も內鮮一體とか內鮮融合を云云してゐますが心の中から半島人はもう旣に皇國臣民になり切つてゐます。實際なりきつてゐますよ。」\n\n\n\nラヂオを通じての文化の交流\n\n「ラヂオを通じて朝鮮と內地、朝鮮と滿洲などと云ふ風に廣く文化の交流をなさいませんか。」\n「してゐます。旣に五月から内地滿洲北支とやつて大いに歡迎されて居ます。」\n「それは存じてゐますが、特別に『文化の夕』とでもして＜23＞內地の大政翼賛會文化部と朝鮮總力聯盟の文化部との交歡放送等を致しませんですか。」\n\n\n\n「さう云ふ必要を感じませんな。文化部でやることだけが必ずしも文化交流のためになるとは云へませんですから、今やつてゐる大政翼賛會との廣い範圍での交歡放送も文化のためになりますからね………」\n「いえ、さう云ふ意味での申上げではございません。一般藝術家のためにたまにはさう云ふ催があつて欲しいものだと思つてゐまして………。」\n「あゝさうですか。さうするのも面白いでせうな。」\n「面白いと思ひます。こゝの矢鍋文化部長を始め各部門の藝術家薘と、また向うは岸田さんを始め內地の詩人小說家などとの交歡放送があればお互にもつと親密な感があつていゝんぢやないかと思はれますが………。」\n「さうですね。これからさう云ふ機會を作る樣にしませうかな。」\n\n歌謠の指導に就いて\n\n「第二放送部で歌謠の指導を始めたのは去年の秋頃からでせう。」\n「さうでせう。」\n「一般家庭から大變な歡迎でございます。實際流行歌は子女敎育上困るしそれだとて適當ないい歌がないので一般家庭で困つて居た際、實に良い企てでありました。」\n「さうですか。それは喜ばしいことですね。第二放送部長の盧さんにもさう云つて下さい。多いにやつて吳れる樣にと。」\n「それから此の頃第二放送部で『思ひ出の曲』と云つて昔の歌をコーラスで放送するのですがそれも實になつかしくてよかつたのです。」\n「さうですか。いゝものはいゝとさう云つて下さい。放送局では一般聽取者の希望に應じてやつてゐますから。」\n「此の間新聞で讀んだことですが東京では公會堂で各地方の『盆踊の歌』の大會をやつてそれを全國に放送致しましたとのことですが、さう云ふ風に朝鮮の民謠と云ひませうか地方獨特な歌でございますね、一般に知られてゐないさう云ふものを調べてそれをラデオで普及しましたらどうでございませうか。」＜24＞\n「それは大變いゝことです。いゝですとも、係の者にさう云つて置きませう。」\n\n朝鮮文學、美術、舞踊、その他\n\n「朝鮮文學についてお話しを承りたいのですが……。」\n「朝鮮の人は小說はうまくないんですね、昔のものもさう感心すべきものがなかつたのですが、近頃のものもさうですね、私は飜譯したのを皆讀んでゐますけれどまづいものばかりでしたよ。それよりも詩はいゝものがありますね、近年のものもいいのがありませうが、李退溪さんの詩など實に立派ですよ。朝鮮の人は小說よりは詩才に富んでゐるらしいんですね。」\n「美術はどうでこざいます？」\n「美術もやはり昔のものがいゝですね。李朝の初め頃の陶器などびつくりする程いゝものがありましたし、繪畵もその時代のものに優るものは一寸ありませんね。皆が高句麗の磁器を賞讚してゐますけれど私は李朝初期の陶器をもつと高く評價したいのです。その以後のものはだんだん惡くなるばかりでした。」\n「舞踊を御覽になつたこと御ざいますか。」\n「あります。「扶餘回想曲」の樣なものはよかつたのですね、實にすばらしいものでした。あれは純粹的な朝鮮のものでないからもつとよかつたと思ひます。內地と朝鮮との折衷ものですね。あゝ云ふものを多いにやつてほしいです。今は戰時だからさう云ふことばかり考へてゐられないんでせうが戰爭が終つたら大いに獎勵したいのですね。」\n\n時局下に於ける半島人に望む\n\n「時局下の半島人に何かお話したいお言葉は御ざいませんでせうか。」\n「半島と別に名づける必要はありません。半島人も日本人です。日本人の全體に希望することは言葉より實行にうつりませうと云ふことです。百遍云ふより一度實行した方がどれ程日木のためになるかわかりません。總力聯盟でいくらやかましく云つても實行出來なかつたら何もなりませんからね。皇軍のためにたばこを送るのもいゝでせうがそれよりも一本のたばこでもそまつにしないのがもつと國のためになります。マツチを大切にしませうよと云つてゐる人より一本のマツチを大切につかつてゐる人の方がどれ程國のためになるかわかりません。だから私達はたゞ默つて實行すればよろしいでせう。何もいはずに。」\n\n趣味、讀書\n\n「甘蔗先生はどう云ふ御趣味をお持ちですか。」＜25＞「趣味ですか。別にこれと云ふものはありませんが、擊劒とボートとスポンチボールとテーニスをやつてゐます。」\n「そのうちで一番面白いのは何ですか。」\n「皆面白いですよ。擊劒は警察官の時分からやつて道知事の時もやつてゐました。」\n「相當なものでゐらつしやいますでせう。」\n「あまりいゝ方ぢやないんです。むしろ惡い方ですよ、二段ですからね。」\n「二段と申しますと、一段の次ですから大變ではありません？」\n「その反對ですよ。八段、九段かう云ふ風に上る程、上手なものですから………。」\n「さうで御ざいますか」\n二人とも暫く笑ふ。\n「讀書はどんなものをなさいまして？」\n「論語を讀んでゐます。それから禪宗も讀んでゐます。禪宗を讀んで禪をやるのが私の趣味の中の一つですね。」\n警察官も府尹も道知事もおなりであつたと云ふ氏の印象が佛樣に近い程仁慈を覺えるざるを得ない理由を私はやつと悟りました。\n\n半年靑年に勸めたい書籍\n\n「先生は半島の靑年達がどんな本を讀んで慾しいのですか。」\n「論語ですね。論語は立派な政治を敎へてゐます。法律を敎へてゐます。道德、人情、何から何まで此の世にあるよきものは皆敎へてゐます。今總力聯盟でやつてゐるのが皆論語にあります。「修身濟家、治國平天下」これ以上立派な敎へがどこにありますか。凡の根本を云つてゐるのではありませんか。自分の身を修めないて自分の家を濟めないものにどうして國が治められるでせう。立派な敎へです。支那は大きい國だけにかう云う風に偉い大聖人が生れたのです。これだけ讀めば何もかも悟る樣になります。わかる樣になります。あなたも今日から論語を是非お讀みなさい。」\n私はたまつてうなづくほかありませんでした。論語を說いてゐらつしやる氏のお顔があまりにも深刻でありましたから―。(了)\n\n□\n第一回―總力聯盟文化部長

situation around Shanghai to the people of the Peninsula. Truly, since the outbreak of the China Incident, the patriotic fervor of our Peninsula compatriots has surged powerfully. In response to this, when the Peninsula Youth Volunteer Soldier system was implemented in April of Showa 13 (1938), devoted Peninsula youths successively volunteered through police stations across all of Korea. Just one week after the Special Volunteer Soldier Ordinance was enacted, the total number surpassed 3,000, reaching about five times the recruitment quota of 400, deeply moving the authorities. Accompanying the progress in the Korean people's level of civilization and popular sentiment, the volunteer soldier system was permitted for Peninsula people. Through this, the aim was to provide training as subjects of the Imperial Nation and have them contribute to the defense of Japan and Korea as one body (内鮮一體). They were selected and recruited, and their post-recruitment status, treatment, and military service were made identical to those of conscripts from the mainland. Since then, with the prolongation of the Incident into a long-term war, the unity and solidarity between the mainland and the Peninsula have been increasingly strengthened. Burning with supreme patriotic sentiment, the youth of the Peninsula, as honorable members of the Imperial Army, are fighting bravely on the Chinese continent, carving out numerous brilliant military achievements. Demonstrating service completely equal to that of the youth from the mainland, they are still, undeterred by the blazing heat, making the hot blood of Peninsula manhood boil over on the very front lines.\n\nEspecially in the recent Central Plains Operation—a major operation that completely encircled and annihilated the 200,000 regular troops of the enemy's First War Area under Wei Lihuang, which had been entrenched in southern Shanxi Province for several years and served as a base for disturbing the peace in North China, thereby cutting out the cancer threatening North China's security—our forces achieved a great military success, leaving behind brilliant <28> military exploits worthy of special mention in the annals of the Imperial Army, suffering 600 casualties against approximately 50,000 enemy bodies abandoned on the field, about 30,000 prisoners of war, and over 8,000 captured officers including army commanders, division commanders, and chiefs of staff. It is a source of deep emotion and gratitude for us that soldiers originating from the Peninsula displayed numerous tales of bravery during this operation. Unfortunately, there is a sense that the meritorious deeds of soldiers from the Peninsula on the front lines tend to be overlooked by journalism. However, a war correspondent who recently returned from this operation told me, \"Far from being inferior to soldiers from the mainland, the soldiers from the Peninsula are fighting bravely as truly fine, more-than-capable soldiers. It is indeed most reassuring.\"\n\nMeanwhile, even on the battlefields of the continent, we frequently hear, through newspapers, magazines, pamphlets, and other materials, about the beautiful stories and praiseworthy tales from the home front within the Peninsula. An 18-year-old Peninsula girl donated sixteen yen and eighteen sen along with a note saying, \"This money is what I earned by making and selling desk covers, dolls, etc., so it's really very little, but please, use it somehow for the soldiers working hard in the war zone. I beg you.\" A 16-year-old boy engaged in road construction, supporting his elderly parents with his meager wages, was moved by a neighborhood chief's talk on the current situation and, wanting to work for the country even for just one day, brought his next day's wage of fifty sen, requesting that it be donated. Knowing the family's financial situation, the ward chief initially tried to dissuade him, saying, \"I will report your sincere heart to the neighborhood chief,\" but due to his strong insistence, the donation procedure was carried out. Also, a deaf man, upon returning home from work, was ashamed that he could not participate in the village donation drive because he was away while all other villagers had contributed. He scolded his wife for her thoughtlessness in not donating at the time, went himself to the police substation, explained the situation through his wife's interpretation, apologized for the delayed donation, and presented two yen, deeply moving the personnel. Besides these, across the entire Peninsula, beautiful stories and praiseworthy tales of Japan-Korea unity on the home front—such as one-lamp/one-sen donations, \"barbershop patriotism\" (バリカン報國), bamboo tube donations, smoke-saving donations, etc.—are blooming profusely, and the officers and soldiers on the front lines are profoundly grateful and moved by the utmost sincerity and fervent patriotism of the Peninsula people.\n\nThe surging patriotism of the Peninsula people is not confined solely within the Peninsula; wherever Peninsula compatriots reside—be it the mainland, Manchuria, North China, or Central China—it manifests as acts of devoted service to the nation, no different from those of the mainland Japanese: donations, collection of comfort items for the Imperial Army, movements to understand the current situation, prayers for victory, making thousand-stitch belts (千人針), and so forth. Particularly in the field, the fact that they have organized special volunteer corps to cooperate with the Imperial Army, even to the point of suffering fatalities, is already known to all. At the Harbin Normal School, when sixth graders and first-year high school students were once asked to respond to questions related to the current situation, to the question \"What kind of resolve have you had as citizens on the home front?\" there were brave responses like \"Resolve to charge forward when the time comes,\" and \"If the soldiers die, I want to grow up and take their place.\" Also, to the question \"Why does Japan win?\" the answer was \"Because our weapons are domestically produced and the Yamato spirit (大和魂) resides within them,\" responses based on an awareness as citizens of Japan and an understanding of the current situation, which is truly impressive. Furthermore, a passage from a letter sent by a certain motorcycle driver serving with the XX unit in North China to his wife back in Korea reads:\n\"While active on the front line, I was wounded in the right ear by an enemy bullet, but it is not life-threatening, so rest assured. I am enclosing forty yen from my salary and a photograph, so look at the place where I was wounded. I don't know when I might die in battle, but I intend to risk my life and work for the sake of our country, so you too, please take care of your health and live well.\" What tragic yet admirable resolve is this? Also, a Peninsula sailor, permitted to work on a government-chartered ship, leaps at the chance, believing \"Now is the time for service!\" His written impressions deeply moved the relevant authorities: \"I know that there have been fierce battles many times until today in North China, Central China, and South China. Each time, I thought of my own situation and felt nothing but regret. It was because, being from the Peninsula, I could not go to war. However, my wish has now been granted, and starting today, I have become a crew member of a government-chartered ship. My heart is full of joy. When I saw the Chinese laborers working on our ship during unloading in North China becoming attached to the Japanese soldiers and looking up to them like parents, I came to believe that righteous Japan will eventually raise a victory song and secure peace in East Asia.\"\n\nCome to think of it, four full years have passed since the outbreak of the China Incident. The Empire's handling of the Incident proceeds according to the established policy, with the two major objectives remaining the destruction of the anti-Japanese regime and the fostering of the newly emerging National Government. The Chongqing regime, due to the valiant struggle of the Imperial Army, is increasingly reaching the extremes of exhaustion and seems to be at the stage where \"just one more push\" is needed.\n\nHowever, due to China's unique characteristics, we must be prepared for the fact that considerable time will still be required until its collapse is witnessed. If we ask about the results of our war in the China Incident, anyone would think of that vast occupied territory and the great blow dealt to the enemy. Let's try comparing the war results of the German army, which is the object of praise from the whole world, with our own war results. Since the start of the war, the German army succeeded in Blitzkrieg operations one after another in Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Yugoslavia, Greece, etc., and in just one year and seven or eight months, they would have captured an area of 1.3 million square kilometers and forced about six to seven million enemy soldiers to surrender. In contrast, our army, since the outbreak of the China Incident until the capture of the Wuhan Three Towns in October of the following year (Showa 13), a period of one year and four or five months, occupied approximately 1.56 million square kilometers of mainland China and inflicted losses of over two to three million on the enemy, thus achieving results even greater than Germany's Blitzkrieg. Why then is the China Incident still unresolved? A major reason lies in the fact that it is a battle against the vast nature of China itself. Whereas if Germany occupied 1.3 million square kilometers, there would be no room left for the enemy to exist, China's total area is 10 million square kilometers [Note: figure likely inaccurate, but reflects the author's perception of scale], meaning our vast occupied territory amounts to merely sixteen or seventeen percent. This is why the Chiang anti-Japanese regime can still survive.<30>\n\nThe above is a view of the Imperial Army's war results in terms of territory. However, we must not forget that the Imperial Army's war results here are not merely because the physique of Japanese soldiers is superior or because their equipment is superior, but rather because their *spiritual strength* (精神力) was superior. Our officers and soldiers possess a strong spiritual power, a belief that they will definitely win against the enemy. This soul is what enables them to march through over four hundred provinces and win battles. This soul is what allowed them to break through those muddy roads and push across those creeks to conquer numerous strong fortifications. No matter how difficult a battle begins, from the commander above down to the lowest private, there is an absolute, unshakable conviction: \"How could we possibly lose to the Chinese army?\" The battlefield is won by the one who endures for the last five minutes. Millions of officers and soldiers who have undergone this precious experience of human spiritual strength have now been forged in our country. Isn't this reassuring? They are truly the veterans of many battles, building the New Order in East Asia (東亞新秩序). Our national spirit, which had been eroded by the corrupting influences of Western culture since the First World War, has been greatly corrected by this Incident. What else could this be but a great war result?\n\nIt goes without saying that the words \"our\" and \"we\" used up to this point in my writing include our Peninsula compatriots. Now is the season when Peninsula compatriots must pour out patriotic fervor equal to that of the mainland Japanese and push forward towards the completion of the Empire's greatest mission: resolving the China Incident and constructing the Greater East Asia New Order.\n\nTo all our Peninsula compatriots! Let us tighten our loincloths (褌) once more and persevere strongly through the fire!<31>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe article, written by a Japanese army officer in 1941, praises the supposed patriotic fervor of Koreans (\"Peninsula compatriots\") supporting Japan's war effort in China. It highlights Korean participation in the volunteer soldier program, bravery on the battlefield (citing the Central Plains Operation), and enthusiastic home front support through donations and morale-boosting activities across Korea and wherever Koreans reside (Japan, Manchuria, China). The author emphasizes the \"Japan-Korea as One Body\" (Naissen Ittai) ideology, compares Japan's military achievements favorably to Germany's, attributes success primarily to superior Japanese \"spiritual strength,\" and concludes with a call for Koreans to redouble their efforts alongside the Japanese for the Empire's mission.\n\nFor historians, this article is a significant example of Japanese wartime propaganda aimed at mobilizing Korean support and reinforcing the *Naissen Ittai* policy. It selectively presents anecdotes to construct a narrative of unified imperial loyalty, downplaying colonial oppression and resistance. The explicit comparison with Nazi Germany's military success and the emphasis on spiritual superiority over material factors offer insights into Japanese wartime ideology and self-perception. The piece reveals the pressure and expectations placed upon Koreans to demonstrate loyalty during a critical phase of the war.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n松田盛太\tマツダセイタ\tMatsuda Morita\n支那派遣軍上海報道部\tシナハケングンシャンハイホウドウブ\tChina Expeditionary Army Shanghai Information Department\n上海\tシャンハイ\tShanghai\n支那\tシナ\tChina\n朝鮮\tチョウセン\tKorea\n山西省\tサンセイショウ\tShanxi Province\n衛立煌\tエイリツコウ\tWei Lihuang\n北支\tホクシ\tNorth China\n中支\tチュウシ\tCentral China\nハルビン\tハルビン\tHarbin\n滿洲\tマンシュウ\tManchuria\n南支\tナンシ\tSouth China\n重慶政權\tジュウケイセイケン\tChongqing Regime\n獨逸\tドイツ\tGermany\nノルウエー\tノルウェー\tNorway\nデンマーク\tデンマーク\tDenmark\nオランダ\tオランダ\tNetherlands\nベルギー\tベルギー\tBelgium\nフランス\tフランス\tFrance\nユーゴー\tユーゴー\tYugoslavia\nギリシヤ\tギリシャ\tGreece\n武漢三鎭\tブカンサンチン\tWuhan Three Towns\n蔣\tショウ\tChiang\n東亞\tトウア\tEast Asia\n\n**Glossary**\n\n半島同胞\tはんとうどうほう\tPeninsula compatriots (referring to Koreans)\n愛國熱\tあいこくねつ\tPatriotic fervor\n勃發\tぼっぱつ\tOutbreak (of war/incident)\n澎湃\tほうはい\tSurging; swelling\n志願兵\tしがんへい\tVolunteer soldier\n皇國臣民\tこうこくしんみん\tSubject of the Imperial Nation\n内鮮一體\tないせんいったい\tJapan and Korea as One Body (ideology)\n國防\tこくぼう\tNational defense\n徴集兵\tちょうしゅうへい\tConscripted soldier\n事變\tじへん\tIncident (euphemism for war, here the Second Sino-Japanese War)\n武勳\tぶくん\tMilitary exploits; distinguished service in battle\n御奉公\tごほうこう\tService (to the Emperor/nation)\n銃後\tじゅうご\tThe home front (lit.

The poem emphasizes the clear sound of the drum and the pleasant, heartfelt atmosphere of the traditional gathering. From a historical perspective, it is noteworthy that a Japanese professor associated with Keijō Hōgaku Senmon Gakkō (Keijō Law College) published a poem appreciating traditional Korean folk culture in a Korean magazine during the late colonial period (1941), a time marked by intensified Japanese assimilation policies. This might reflect a personal aesthetic appreciation possibly running counter to official cultural suppression, or perhaps a form of romanticized orientalism focusing on unchanging rural traditions.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n杉本長夫\tすぎもと ながお\tSugimoto Nagao\n京城法學專門學校\tけいじょうほうがくせんもんがっこう\tKeijō Hōgaku Senmon Gakkō\n\n**Glossary**\n\n風落ちて\tかぜおちて\tThe wind drops/dies down\nいぶせき\tいぶせき\tGloomy, smoky, irritating (classical adjective form)\n蚊遣\tかやり\tMosquito repellent smoke/smudge\n前庭\tまえにわ\tFront garden, courtyard\nつどひ\tつどい\tGathering (older nominal form of 集う - tsudou)\n拍子\tひょうし\tRhythm, time, beat\nをかしき\tおかしき\tAmusing, charming, interesting (classical adjective form)\n身振り\tみぶり\tGesture, movement\nたゝく\tたたく\tTo strike, to beat, to clap (ゝ indicates repetition of the preceding kana sound, older orthography)\n長皷(チヤング)\tちょうご (ちゃんぐ)\tChanggo (Korean hourglass drum); the furigana indicates the reading 'Changu'\n人影\tひとかげ\tHuman figure, shadow\nほのかなる\tほのかなる\tFaint, dim (classical adjective form)\n冴えわたる\tさえわたる\tTo be clear and penetrating (of sound, cold, light); to spread clearly\n調子(ふし)\tちょうし (ふし)\tTune, melody; the furigana indicates the reading 'Fushi'\nせつせつ\tせつせつ\tEarnest, ardent, eager; plaintive\n捻りつゝ\tひねりつつ\tWhile twisting (older form, つゝ = つつ)\n田園\tでんえん\tCountryside, rural district\n古りたる\tふりたる\tOld, aged (classical/older form of 古びた - furubita)\n樂しき\tたのしき\tEnjoyable, pleasant (classical adjective form)\n打手\tうちて\tDrummer, striker\n古老\tころう\tVillage elder, old person\n舞手\tまいて\tDancer\n粹人\tすいじん\tPerson of refined taste, connoisseur, chic person\n觸れて\tふれて\tTouching, affecting\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n잡지명\t삼천리 제13권 제9호\n발행일\t1941년 09월 01일\n기사제목\t長鼓\n필자\t杉本長夫\n기사형태\t시\n\n長鼓\n\t\t\t\t\t\t杉本長夫\n風落ちて\nいぶせき蚊遣の煙焚き\n前庭に人々つどひ\n拍子とり をかしき身振りなどして\nたゝくは長皷(チヤング)\n人影の動くとみれば\nほのかなる月\n松林の上に出で＜32＞\n長皷(チヤング)の音一入と冴えわたり\n唄うたふ調子(ふし)はせつせつ\n長き髭 捻りつゝ歌ひつゝ\n長皷(チヤング)はなる\n田園の古りたる家の\n樂しきつどひ\n打手は村の古老\n舞手は村の粹人\n月は良し\n人々の心に觸れて\n冴えわたる長皷(チヤング)の響。\n(筆者は京城法學專門學校敎授)＜33＞\n＜32-33＞","magazine":"三千里 제13권 제9호","date":"1941년 09월 01일","title":"Changgo (Hourglass Drum)"},{"path":"86_13.09_1941.09/050.txt","issue":"86_13.09_1941.09","content":"七月常會 (July Regular Meeting)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t椎木美代子 (Shiiki Miyoko)\n\nThe July Regular Meeting, a commemorative month, amidst the morning breeze that dawned with rainbow-colored clouds.\n\nThe overnight rain cleared this morning; those gathered for the regular meeting speak cheerfully.\n\nThe Governor-General's address is strong; it comes ringing clearly from the microphone.

The poems contrast public life under Japanese rule with private, maternal, and introspective feelings. The first section depicts a \"July Regular Meeting\" permeated by the militaristic rhetoric of the Governor-General's address promoting the \"Way of the Subject.\" Subsequent sections, \"Mother's Song\" and \"Untitled,\" shift to personal themes: the bittersweet experience of a child growing up, feelings of inadequacy, inner conflict, and observations of urban alienation. From a historical perspective, the poems are interesting for their juxtaposition of mandated public sentiment (loyalty to the Japanese empire) and the personal, sometimes melancholic, inner world of an individual living within that colonial structure during wartime. The explicit mention of the Governor-General's address and the \"Way of the Subject\" (臣道) provides direct evidence of the political atmosphere being promoted.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n椎木美代子\tしいき

Absorption)\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTsuda Setsuko\n\nWhen bathed in the light of the moon, everyone becomes sad.\n*When I see the moon,*\n*Sadness comes in a thousand forms—*\n*Though the autumn is not for me alone.*\nThe ancients who sang this poem and we of the Shōwa era are the same.\n\n*Seeing the moonlight, I become sad*\n*Why do tears flow?*\n*Within the moonlight lies a country*\n*A nostalgic homeland of love*\n*On evenings when moonlight streams*\n*My thoughts grow ever more lonely*\n*Seeing the moonlight, I become sad*\n*Why do tears flow?*\n\nThis old poem, which I've loved since I was a girl, is one I still find myself humming on moonlit nights.\nThe sky's color is relatively bright, almost appearing a pale yellow, and within it is a mass of light, as if drenched, a crystallization of light that seems as if droplets might drip down—when I gaze fixedly up at it like this, my body and soul seem to become drenched too. And then, a pleasant sadness, making me want to be coddled, to silently take someone's hand, gently envelops me. And whenever I look up at a full moon like tonight's, I invariably recall the words \"Gatsuai Zanmai\" (月愛三昧 - Moon-Love Samādhi).\n\nGatsuai Zanmai (月愛三昧)—please look at these characters. I love these characters. The character for moon (月), the character for love (愛), and the word \"sanmai\" (三昧). It is said that this light of the full moon is the light that naturally flows from the unwavering body of the Buddha when he enters the meditative state called Gatsuai Zanmai <41> (月愛三昧).\n\nKing Ajase (阿闍世), deceived by a wicked friend, killed his father and imprisoned his mother. Out of shame and remorse, he suffered in body and mind.\n*Like a pond where lotus flowers do not bloom*\n*Like a tree that bears no blossoms*\n*Like a king who has lost his country*\nIt is written that he was wasting away with grief. When a good friend named Jīvaka (耆婆) was telling him various things about the Buddha, the voice of his deceased father echoed from somewhere, commanding, \"Go quickly to the Buddha and seek salvation.\" Upon hearing this voice, the king fainted and collapsed to the ground.\n\"At that time, the World-Honored One (世尊), being between the twin Sāla trees (娑羅雙樹)...\"\nHe saw this Ajase. The gentle eyes of the Buddha must have been moist with tears. And to save King Ajase, he entered the meditative concentration (禪定 - zenjō) called Gatsuai Zanmai. Then, a cool, refreshing light began to overflow from his body, illuminating the fallen Ajase's form and enveloping his defiled, wounded flesh. As the suffering of his body and mind suddenly vanished, King Ajase, astonished, asked Jīvaka (耆婆) beside him:\n\"From where does this light come?\"\nJīvaka replied:\n\"Great King, you should know that such an auspicious sign (瑞相) is indeed the radiant light emitted by the Tathāgata (如來) upon entering the Gatsuai Zanmai (月愛三昧).\"\nThis is the story found in the Nirvana Sutra (涅槃經). I thought it was a truly beautiful story.\nCool, refreshing light, pellucid light. And the light of the moon, which holds shadows somewhere within it—this, it is said, is the radiant light the Buddha emits upon entering Gatsuai Zanmai. Moreover, it is said that the recipient of this is the wicked and inhuman Ajase.\nThe Buddha explains it thus:\n\"I entered Gatsuai Zanmai for the sake of Ajase alone. However, that Ajase refers to all ordinary beings (一切凡夫). Ajase means all people who suffer and are troubled. Ajase means all women (一切の女人).\"\nThere are many poems praising the moonlight. There are many stories pledging oaths by the moonlight. But I believe there is no other story as beautiful, as fitting for the moonlight, as this one.\n\nThe faint crescent moon with its delicate brow is lovely, and the five-day moon floating solitarily is also beautiful, but it is the roundness, the beauty of the full moon that I can truly look up at with a sense of gratitude. Light that permeates even the depths of the heart; gazing at the moon while holding feelings that overflow the chest, one can weep with the feeling of crying on a distant mother's back, and at other times, one can gaze at the moon with the affectionate heart of a young child snuggling against its mother's cheek. The moonlight is a caress and a compassion. <42>\nI make an effort to look up at the moon. It is because I want to make my heart cool and clear. When I join my palms towards the moon, close my eyes and pray, then raise my eyes and gaze at the moon once more, true love flows into our bodies through human sentimentality.\nThe ill-fated poetess Takeuchi Teruyo sang:\n\n*This beautiful, pure light*\n*Oh, Moon!*\n*Is the wordless love*\n*You show to humankind.*\n\n*Traveling alone through the vast sky*\n*Until you sink into the western woods*\n*I scoop that light in the palm of my hand (たなごゝろ)*\n*And quietly worship that light.*\n\nAh, I too spread open both hands to scoop this moonlight, and purify myself (みそぎ) within the moonlight meant for suffering women (苦しめる女人). <43>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis essay by Tsuda Setsuko reflects on the profound emotional and spiritual connection the author feels with moonlight, particularly the full moon. She describes the sadness and longing evoked by moonlight, linking it to classical poetry and a personal favorite poem. The core of the essay explores the Buddhist concept of \"Gatsuai Zanmai\" (Moon-Love Samādhi) from the Nirvana Sutra, where the Buddha emits a purifying, compassionate light to save the suffering King Ajase, who represents all troubled beings, especially women. The author finds solace, purification, and a connection to universal love and compassion by consciously bathing in and contemplating the moonlight, echoing the sentiments of the poetess Takeuchi Teruyo. From a historical perspective, this Japanese author's contemplative piece published in a prominent Korean magazine (\"Samch'ŏlli\") during the late colonial period is interesting. It highlights the presence of Japanese cultural and spiritual expression within the Korean public sphere and offers insight into personal solace sought through Buddhism and nature appreciation, perhaps as an escape or counterpoint to the harsh realities of the time, particularly focusing on female suffering and spiritual remedy.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n津田節子\tつだせつこ\tTsuda Setsuko\n昭和\tしょうわ\tShōwa\n阿闍世\tあじゃせ\tAjase (Ajatashatru)\n耆婆\tぎば\tGiba (Jīvaka)\n世尊\tせそん\tSeson (World-Honored One / Buddha)\n娑羅雙樹\tさらそうじゅ\tSarasōju (Twin Sāla Trees)\n如來\tにょらい\tNyorai (Tathāgata / Buddha)\n涅槃經\tねはんきょう\tNehankyō (Nirvana Sutra)\n竹內てるよ\tたけうちてるよ\tTakeuchi Teruyo\n\n**Glossary**\n\n月光\tげっこう\tMoonlight\nかなしく\tかなしく\tSadly, sorrowfully (Classical/older adverbial form of 悲しい)\nわがみ\tわがみ\tMyself, my own self (Slightly archaic/poetic form of 我が身)\n一つ\tひとつ\tOne, single (Here implies 'alone' or 'unique to')\n淚\tなみだ\tTears (Older Kanji form of 涙)\n何ゆゑか\tなにゆえか\tWhy, for what reason (Archaic/literary form of なぜか)\nふるさと\tふるさと\tHometown, native place (Written in hiragana, common)\nおもひ\tおもい\tThoughts, feelings (Older kana spelling of 思い)\nいよゝ\tいよいよ\tMore and more, increasingly (Older kana spelling/iteration mark use for いよいよ)\n好きだつた\tすきだった\tLiked, was fond of (Slightly older colloquial past tense form)\nやつぱり\tやっぱり\tAs expected, still, after all (Colloquial form of やはり)\n淺黃色\tあさぎいろ\tPale yellow, light yellow-green\nしたゝり落ち\tしたたりおち\tTo drip down, trickle down\n仰いでゐます\tあおいでいます\tAm looking up at (Continuous form using older kana ゐ)\n默つて\tだまって\tSilently\nしみ〲と\tしみじみと\tDeeply, keenly, heartily\n滿月\tまんげつ\tFull moon\n月愛三昧\tがつあいざんまい\tMoon-Love Samādhi (A specific Buddhist meditative state)\n禪定\tぜんじょう\tMeditative concentration (Dhyāna in Sanskrit)\nおからだ\tおからだ\tBody (Honorific form of 体)\nおのづから\tおのずから\tNaturally, spontaneously\n慚愧\tざんき\tShame, remorse\n幽閉\tゆうへい\tConfinement, imprisonment\n愁ひ\tうれい\tGrief, sorrow, melancholy (Older noun form)\n悶絶\tもんぜつ\tFainting in agony, agony\n救ひ\tすくい\tSalvation, rescue, help\n世尊\tせそん\tWorld-Honored One (An epithet for the Buddha)\n淸凉\tせいりょう\tCool and refreshing\n溢れはじめ\tあふれはじめ\tBegan to overflow\n怱ち\tたちまち\tSuddenly, in an instant\n瑞相\tずいそう\tAuspicious sign, wondrous omen\n如來\tにょらい\tTathāgata (Thus Come One - an epithet for the Buddha)\n光明\tこうみょう\tBright light, radiance (Often used in a sacred context)\n透徹\tとうてつ\tTransparent, clear, pellucid\n陰翳\tいんえい\tShadow, shade, nuance\n惡逆無道\tあくぎゃくむどう\tAtrocious and inhuman, tyrannical\n凡夫\tぼんぶ\tOrdinary person, common mortal (Buddhist term)\n女人\tんにょにん\tWoman (Often used in Buddhist texts, sometimes with nuance of being harder to attain enlightenment)\nたゝへる\tたたえる\tTo praise, extol\n誓へる\tちかえる\tTo pledge, vow (Potential typo for 讃える - tataeru - to praise?

Through the dense, gloomy green thicket, a stately grey Western-style building came faintly into view. As I climbed up, it was precisely the time for the morning assembly. I immediately observed the situation, but oh, the miserable state of the children was truly beyond imagination! Just one glance revealed the nature of their lives. Forgetting the heat, my head felt strangely blank, almost numb.\nSoon, I warmly greeted the head teacher, Mr. Kim (金先生), and all the other teachers. Then, I addressed Mr. Kim, saying, \"I am well aware of the reputation of Yamato Juku's work. I don't need money. I simply wish, out of passion and spirit, to become a good friend to the unfortunate children studying at your esteemed institution.\" After listening to various things, the teacher tactfully replied, \"Well then, I shall inform you tomorrow.\"\nHe said something enigmatic like that. I went straight home that day, wondering what would happen, but perhaps by the grace of God, I immediately received a phone call with their acceptance.\nMy happiness at that moment is impossible to express. Suddenly, I felt a sense of attachment spring up for this place called Yamato Juku.\n\nMonth X, Day X\nFrom today, to become a good guide for these young children, I shall truly build good habits that will form the foundation of my life. Whether this can be put into practice or not will likely be shown in the results later, but on this first day of social life, so far removed from my student life—that is, a life too simple—I vowed this much to myself.\nUnexpectedly, letters of encouragement arrived from various people.\n\nMonth X, Day X\nToday, filled with hope, I visited Chōsen Jingū (朝鮮神宮). Until yesterday, I went led by a teacher, but now, thinking of myself leading hundreds of young children, I was struck by an indescribable feeling, somewhat ticklish, somewhat amusing.\nAgain today, three or four letters arrived.\n\nMonth X, Day X\nFrom the morning, \"One, two, three, four,\" came the cheerful, energetic voices leaking from the radio <45>. With the promising morning sun at our backs, breathing in the fresh air, we vigorously moved our bodies along with those voices, together with the young children, using all our strength. What a pleasant morning it must have been!\nAgain today, [letters] came. I felt the weight of responsibility increasing.\n\nMonth X, Day X\nStarting today, I began home visits. As I investigated, I truly couldn't help but feel tense, thinking, \"Do people really live such miserable lives, lives one couldn't even dream of in human existence?\" It was somewhat alarming that in a class of fifty students, all fifty families were in the same situation. Owning a single thatch-roofed house that looks like it could collapse any moment if the wind blew is, so to speak, the upper class among them; all the others are children of dugout-hut dwellers (土幕民). While visiting the homes of these children one by one, a thought occurred to me: I decided to observe the 'naked human,' that is, life stripped bare. What is the fundamental state of human beings? People wander around in a society stratified into various classes like rich, poor, student, laborer, gentleman. I thought I might see humans as they are, stripped of such things, perhaps at a swimming pool. People easily become arrogant if they are slightly above others in status or attend a higher-level school, but depending on one's self-cultivation, there seems to be room for caution. I experienced this on the train on my way home today. A man who looked like a laborer, wearing very dirty clothes, sat right in front of me. His body odor was so sickening it's impossible to describe. Yet, his face was masculine and dignified. Even this alone gave pause for thought. If his clothes hadn't been dirty, or rather, if he had worn clothes that suited his physique well, I probably wouldn't have felt so disgusted. Perhaps people in the world are all like that. People, especially women in general, tend to respect or despise others based solely on their clothes, judging by the fine titles bought with their wealth and status, but isn't this truly a mistaken way of thinking? Today's diary entry has become as long as a novel.\nEspecially today, despite the heat, I was able to visit about fifty homes together with Mr. Kanemitsu (金光先生). I thanked the teacher profoundly from my heart.\n\nMonth X, Day X\nToday I met the Director (所長先生) for the first time; he was very gentle, yet also had a stern side. Also, in the afternoon, his wife came all the way in the heat, which made me feel slightly apologetic. Truly, I couldn't help but feel grateful from the bottom of my heart for everyone's kindness.\nAgain today, two or three letters arrived. It seems society holds great expectations.\n\nMonth X, Day X\nThe more one works, the more rewarding it becomes. It is through activity that both body and mind become focused. What a pleasant feeling we experience when entering a clean room! Looking at a tidy desk, one feels as if one's own mind and body have become well-ordered. Just as cleanliness and order cannot be achieved without work, what can come from just sitting idly? <46>\nNow is my time to work.\nWork with all your heart, as long as you have strength.\nToday, too, after sweating together with the children while cleaning the classroom and toilets, my spirits somehow felt refreshed and clear.\nAgain today, various letters of encouragement arrived from unknown people. Reading letters has become a daily routine.\n\nMonth X, Day X\nDragging my tired body, I returned home. Soon after, according to a phone call from Mr. Kanemitsu, an article about me had been published in the Chōsen Shinbun (朝鮮新聞). It was so sudden that I was surprised. Anyway, when I looked at the newspaper, my own story was certainly written there, which quite took me aback. There was no need to go this far, especially since I've only been out in society for a few days. In any case, the results will appear in the end, but while my position becomes enjoyable on one hand, I can't help but feel pained on the other.\nStill, [letters] came again.\n\nMonth X, Day X\nToday again, reporters from both Keijō newspaper companies visited despite the heat. I felt the weight of responsibility growing day by day. In any case, I'll try my best, as long as I have the strength and ability.\n\nMonth X, Day X\nGoing to school as usual, I think of the innocent, lovely children. The children get attached to me like a mother or perhaps an older sister. Well, I think this can be great mental training for studying the psychology of becoming a future mother. When and by whom was the praise of maternal love first proclaimed? There is nothing strange, and certainly nothing praiseworthy, about a mother loving her child. It's a natural feeling that even birds and beasts possess. It is said that for the love of her child, a woman endures all sorts of things. In the same way, I intend to persevere through anything for these children.\nFinally, I tried to write down my impressions of the teachers at Yamato Juku from when I first visited. They were generally like this:\nFirst, Mr. Kanemitsu (金光先生)\nAt first glance, he looks enough like a king from somewhere. He has a well-defined, smart style, like the middle finger of a hand. Especially when he's smiling, if you look closely at his eyes, anyone would likely be charmed.\nMr. Eshiro (江城先生): At first glance, he seems to have a solid character. He feels like the ring finger of a hand. This teacher is the music teacher and possesses a beautiful voice, beyond description. No wonder he produced a voice far removed from an amateur. He also seems like a sentimental type; at first glance, the poetry of Saijō Yaso (西條八十氏) came to mind. He also had an intellectual side.\nMr. Tamagawa (玉川先生)\nAt first glance, he gave the impression of a great hero type. Like the thumb of a hand, he seemed the type who would eventually settle comfortably into a plush, round chair – a company president type. He was a bit stout and looked hot.\nMr. Hirahara (平原先生)\nAt first glance, he looked old for his age. Also, I thought he was a very serious person. I thought he might be a difficult person to socialize with. In terms of a hand, he resembles the index finger.\n(End) <47>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis diary, written by Kim Chae-gyŏng, a new female teacher at the Yamato Juku in Keijō (colonial Seoul) in 1941, chronicles her first week. She expresses initial idealism and a desire to help the impoverished students, whose miserable living conditions (including many living in dugout huts) shock her during home visits. She reflects on social class, appearances versus inner character, and the nature of work and responsibility, spurred by encouragement letters and unexpected newspaper publicity. She also records her initial impressions of her male colleagues. The article offers a glimpse into the life of an educated Korean woman navigating the complexities of colonial society, working within a Japanese institution potentially aimed at assimilation (Yamato Juku). Historians might find interest in the firsthand account of poverty in colonial Seoul, the teacher's blend of naive idealism and nascent social critique, the mention of Chōsen Jingū visits (indicating state Shinto practice), and the description of the social dynamics and public attention surrounding her work.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n京城\tけいじょう\tKeijō\n大和塾\tやまとじゅく\tYamato Juku\n金先生\tきんせんせい\tMr. Kim (Kim Sensei)\n朝鮮神宮\tちょうせんじんぐう\tChōsen Jingū\n金光先生\tかねみつせんせい\tMr. Kanemitsu (Kanemitsu Sensei)\n土幕民\tどまくみん\tDomakumin (dugout-hut dwellers)\n所長先生\tしょちょうせんせい\tDirector (Shochō Sensei)\n朝鮮新聞\tちょうせんしんぶん\tChōsen Shinbun\n江城先生\tえしろせんせい\tMr. Eshiro (Eshiro Sensei)\n西條八十氏\tさいじょうやそし\tMr. Saijō Yaso\n玉川先生\tたまがわせんせい\tMr. Tamagawa (Tamagawa Sensei)\n平原先生\tひらはらせんせい\tMr. Hirahara (Hirahara Sensei)\n\n**Glossary**\n\n身仕舞\tみじまい\tGetting dressed, preparing oneself\nうつ蒼\tうっそう\tGloomy, dense (vegetation)\nしつくり\tしっくり\tNeatly, stately, harmoniously\n洋館\tようかん\tWestern-style building\n朝禮\tちょうれい\tMorning assembly/ceremony\nみじめ\tみじめ\tMiserable, wretched\n窺う\tうかがう\tTo peep, to spy, to get a glimpse of\n氣の毒\tきのどく\tPitiful, unfortunate\n體良く\tていよく\tTactfully, plausibly, politely\n謎見たいな\tなぞみたいな\tEnigmatic, like a riddle\n承諾\tしょうだく\tConsent, acceptance\n愛着心\tあいちゃくしん\tFeeling of attachment/affection\n指導者\tしどうしゃ\tLeader, guide\n實行\tじっこう\tPractice, execution, implementation\n單純\tたんじゅん\tSimple, naive\n方方\tほうぼう\tVarious people, here and there\n激勵\tげきれい\tEncouragement\n參拜\tさんぱい\tWorship, visit to a shrine/temple\n引率\tいんそつ\tLeading (a group)\nくすくつたい\tくすぐったい\tTicklish, embarrassing\nラヂオ\tラジオ\tRadio (older katakana spelling)\n家庭訪門\tかていほうもん\tHome visit\n土幕民\tどまくみん\tPeople living in dugout huts (specific historical term for impoverished dwellers)\n裸\tはだか\tNaked, bare\n本態\tほんたい\tTrue nature, essence\n階級づけられた\tかいきゅうづけられた\tStratified, classified by rank\n水泳場\tすいえいじょう\tSwimming pool\n高慢\tこうまん\tArrogant, haughty\n修養\tしゅうよう\tSelf-cultivation, discipline\n穢ない\tきたない\tDirty, filthy (older spelling of 汚い)\n體臭\tたいしゅう\tBody odor\nうんざり\tうんざり\tTedious, boring, sickening\n凜々しい\tりりしい\tDignified, gallant\n肩書\tかたがき\tTitle, rank, social standing\n輕茂\tけいぶ\tContempt, scorn (likely 軽侮)\n所長\tしょちょう\tDirector, head of an institute\n心つかひ\tこころづかい\tConsideration, kindness (often 心遣い)\n整頓\tせいとん\tOrderliness, tidiness\n便所\tべんじょ\tToilet, lavatory\n面喰ふ\tめんくらう\tTo be bewildered, taken aback (often 面食らう)\n無心\tむしん\tInnocent, artless\n馴つく\tなつく\tTo become attached to, to tame (often 懐く)\n母性愛\tぼせいあい\tMaternal love\n讚美\tさんび\tPraise, adoration\n不審\tふしん\tSuspicion, doubt, strangeness\n印象\tいんしょう\tImpression\n王樣\tおうさま\tKing (often 王様)\n中指\tなかゆび\tMiddle finger\nスマート\tスマート\tSmart, stylish\nスタイル\tスタイル\tStyle\n目許\tめもと\tExpression of the eyes, around the eyes\n藥指\tくすりゆび\tRing finger\n美聲\tびせい\tBeautiful voice\n素人離れ\tしろうとばなれ\tProfessional (skill), unlike an amateur\nセンチ\tセンチ\tSentimental (loan word)\n理智的\tりちてき\tIntellectual, rational\n親指\tおやゆび\tThumb\n豪傑作\tごうけつさく\tMasterpiece of heroism;

Battlefield\n\nAbout a squad's worth crawling forward (move) <48>\nSmoke screens drift, gunfire roars, artillery shells kick up clouds of dirt. Amidst this, the squad crawls forward relentlessly.\nLeading the crawl is Yi In Sŏk (李仁錫) (moving close-up), his face determined for death. Staring intently ahead, he throws a hand grenade.\nA Chinese army trench. A Czech machine gun and Chinese soldiers are blown away.\nThe squad, led by Yi, fiercely charges in with Squad Leader Miyake shouting \"Charge!\"\nThe squad captures the enemy firing position. They set up a light machine gun at that point and begin firing intensely at the counter-attacking enemy. (Waving the national flag to signal the rear is also fine). The sound of the rear friendly forces' charge bugle begins to be heard.\nSuddenly, a mortar shell lands near the squad (between the camera and the squad). The dust cloud temporarily obscures the squad.\nWithin the smoke, Squad Leader Miyake's voice is heard.\n\"Is everyone alright? Yamada! Imai! Konishi! Uchida!\"\n元気な replies are heard respectively, but then,\n\"Yi! Yi In Sŏk! What happened to Yi!\"\nThere is no answer from Yi. Gradually, the smoke clears (camera moves forward as it flows).\nThe seriously wounded Yi is being held by Squad Leader Miyake.\n\"Hang in there! Yi In Sŏk! Yi In Sŏk!\"\n\"A wound like this is nothing! Keep your spirits up!\"\nEventually, Yi quietly opens his eyes and, though faint, speaks in a firm tone:\n\"Tennō Heika—Banzai!\" (Long live the Emperor!)\nHe shouts (From the depths of the gunfire and charge sounds, the music of \"Umi Yukaba\" faintly and distantly surrounds Yi).\nSquad Leader Miyake and the soldiers exchange looks of despair.\n\"Yi! Do you have any last words?\"\nSquad Leader Miyake asks. Yi replies, \"If I die like this, will I not be ashamed as a youth of the Peninsula?\" The Squad Leader says, \"You were splendid. It's the noble end of a Japanese subject.\"\nYi shows a satisfied smile.\nThen, growing closer to death,\n\"Please give my regards to the Commandant and instructors of the Volunteer Soldier Training Center.\"\nHe makes this tragic final statement.\n(\"Umi Yukaba\" continues into the next scene)\n\nNote\nRefer to the following section for the staging of this scene.\nOutline of Yi In Sŏk's Unit Situation\nAffiliation: Kigoshi Unit, Takehana Corps, Hatano Corps\nDate and Time of Death: June 22, 1939, 7:00 PM\nPlace of Death: Battle of Majiamiao (馬家廟), Kwangok (垣曲) Operation.\n\nOutline of Battle Situation\nOn this day, the attack on Majiamiao began at noon. Captain Takehana and his men fought fiercely, occupying the area around 4:00 PM. They then came under concentrated enemy mortar fire and were counter-attacked from three sides, with hand grenades being thrown. At this point, the Company Commander decided to engage the enemy in close combat, leaping out and striving to cut down and repel the swarming enemy.\nYi In Sŏk, following the Platoon Leader, jumped out wielding his bayoneted rifle, skillfully cutting down several enemies. While fighting alongside the Platoon Leader to secure the position, unfortunately, around 7:00 PM, another shell hit Yi In Sŏk, and he finally fell.\nIn this battle, the Platoon Leader (Second Lieutenant Hirokami) was killed in action, one was wounded, and the following day, the 23rd, the Battalion <49> Commander also died in this fierce battle.\n\nPrologue\n2. Training Center Parade Ground\n\nAn instructor (Ōhinata) is addressing about a company's worth of students gathered in a circle, ready to depart for a march.\n\"Yi died splendidly in battle like this.\"\n\"This patriotic spirit of Yi is the very spirit of this training center.\"\n\"Reverently, in the recent awards, Yi's distinguished service was recognized, and he was granted the Order of the Golden Kite (金鵄勳章), the highest honor for a Japanese subject.\"\n\"Such is the pervasiveness of Imperial grace. It falls equally upon all subjects, without any discrimination.\"\n\"Do not forget the Emperor's grace. And live by the spirit of 'Mimī Ware' (We, the Emperor's people).\"\n\"Never forgetting this Imperial grace and adhering always to the spirit of 'Mimī Ware' is precisely the spirit of this training center, and it was also the spirit of your senior, Yi In Sŏk, who graduated from this training center.\"\n\"In just a few days, you will graduate from the training center and finally enter service as glorious soldiers of the Imperial Army. As you are about to begin your final training march, I offer these words to reawaken your national spirit. That is all!\"\nAfter giving the above admonition, he receives their salute.\n\"Order to depart, marching bugle begins.\"\n\nPrologue Double\n3. Gate of the Volunteer Soldier Training Center\n\nThe column marches out of the camp gate in perfect step (The gate sign must be readable).\nA very long shot, ideally including a full view of the school building.\n\n1. Willow-lined Road\n\nF.I.\nVolunteer soldier students are marching, singing a heroic military song.\nEveryone's face is filled with bursting happiness.\nVolunteer Soldier A asks B next to him.\n\"Where do you want to go after graduating from the training center?\"\nA: \"I'm going to the garrison in Manchuria.\"\nC: \"I definitely want the front lines.\"\nA calls out to the column across.\n\"Hey, Unchan!\"\nThe one who turns around is Yasumoto, a former driver (untenshu). Yasumoto, annoyed, says:\n\"Stop calling me Unchan. I used to be a car driver (unchan), but now I'm a respectable volunteer soldier. What's this 'Unchan' talk to a soldier?\"\nHe puffs up.\nA: \"Oh, sorry, sorry. By the way, Yasumoto, you're going into the motor transport corps, right?\"\nYasumoto: \"No, I'm going to drive a tank this time!\"\nHe throws his shoulders back. Everyone gasps, \"Hoh!\"\nYasumoto calls to another column:\n\"Hey, Chokoman!\"\nThe one called, a small student nicknamed Chokoman, Shimizu, turns back, \"What is it?\"\nYasumoto: \"When I ride the tank, since you're Chokoman (small and agile), I'll let you ride with me.\"\nShimizu: \"My body may be 'Chokoman,' but I'm going to be the one firing the cannon.\"\nThe lead student, Kaneko Eisuke, laughs.\n\"Yasumoto lost this one. Speaking of Chokoman Shimizu, he's famous throughout the training center <50> for his high morale.\"\nA says:\n\"Anyway, despite being short, he volunteered, got rejected many times, but at the last physical exam, he finally stretched his legs and forced his way to pass.\"\nEveryone chuckles.\nChokoman Shimizu, trying to hide his embarrassment:\n\"Look at that Yamamoto. What a sloppy guy.\"\nEveryone looks that way.\nThe fat Yamamoto is panting and sweating profusely.\nShimizu: \"With that physique, just because he wanted to be a volunteer soldier, he apparently kept running two and a half ri (about 10 km) every morning to the village shrine to pray. Sounds like a lie.\"\nEisuke: \"Hoh, so Yamamoto has such a story too?\"\nShimizu: \"Everyone's zealous. Even you, Squad Leader, I hear you quit music school midway?\"\nEisuke: \"Mm, but this is the natural duty of a Japanese man. Even to become a great artist, the military spirit is absolutely necessary.\"\nShimizu: \"That's right. Especially for us Peninsula people (半島人) to become better Japanese, entering military life and acquiring the true Japanese spirit is key.\"\nAmong the column, Kinoshita Tarō has been marching silently and melancholically. Yasumoto notices him.\n\"Kinoshita!\"\nHe calls out.\nKinoshita replies with a listless \"Yeah,\" but continues walking silently.\nEisuke glances at him reproachfully.\nYasumoto: \"He's brooding again.\"\nShimizu: \"Strange, lately he...\"\nJust then, the march reaches its destination.\n\n2. Open Square\n\nOnce everyone is lined up, they loudly recite the Oath of Imperial Subjects (皇國臣民の誓詞). When finished, the instructor gives instructions.\n\"In just a few more days, you will graduate from the Volunteer Soldier Training Center and finally become glorious soldiers of the Imperial Army.\"\nEveryone instinctively snaps to attention.\n\"Today marks the final event of your training center life: field camping. Everyone, prepare accordingly.\"\n\n3. Field Camp Site\n\nAlready set up.\nWomen from nearby houses bring soba noodles, rice cakes, and eggs.\n\"Please have some of this.\"\nThe volunteer soldiers decline.\nWomen:\n\"No, if you don't eat this, we won't leave.\"\nThey sit down on the field.\nReluctantly, the soldiers accept.\nThe women return home, looking pleased.\n\n4. Nearby House\n\nStudents enjoying board jumping (板飛び).\nThe large, fat Yamamoto falls on his backside.\nThe village girls also burst into laughter.\n\n5. Willow by the Riverbank\n\nA high swing (鞦韆). <51>\nTwo girls are riding it.\nVolunteer soldiers watch them.\nWP (Wipe)\n\n6. Camp at Night\n\nFierce night exercises are underway.\n\n7. Inside a Tent\n\nVolunteer soldiers sleep, exhausted. An instructor comes around checking, fixing the posture of sleeping students, tucking in blankets, showing care. The snores of energetic students continue.\n\n8. Outside\n\nUnder the moonlight. Sentry posts stand here and there around the tent camp. A dog howls in the distance.\n\n9. Another Tent\n\nA student pretending to sleep reads a letter by moonlight. It is Kinoshita Tarō. Kaneko Eisuke, on watch duty, notices him.\nStill unaware, Kinoshita stares at the letter.\nEisuke:\n\"Hey, Kinoshita, what are you doing?\"\nKinoshita, startled, hides the letter.\n\"Ah! Squad Leader!\"\nAs Kinoshita sits up, his eyes are inexplicably wet with tears.\nEisuke, sternly:\n\"You haven't gotten homesick, have you?\"\nKinoshita is silent.\nEisuke: \"Or perhaps you've become afraid of going to the battlefield?\"\nKinoshita remains silent.\n\"Unworthy of a soldier! Crying like that, so unmanly. Speak clearly!\"\nHe shouts.\nKinoshita hands the letter he was holding to Eisuke.\n\"Squad Leader, please read this letter.\"\nEisuke takes Kinoshita's letter and looks at it. As he reads quietly, he involuntarily closes his eyes.\nThen he says:\n\"Your boy died, didn't he?\"\nKinoshita nods, \"Yes.\"\nEisuke: \"I see. So you had a wife and child.\"\nKinoshita nods.\nEisuke: \"And when did he pass away?\"\nKinoshita: \"Yes. He died two months after I entered the training center, but I received no word from home. This news is from a friend.\"\nEisuke looks at the letter again.\n\n10. Same, Outside\n\nAn instructor making rounds looks inside suspiciously. Eisuke straightens up, salutes, and reports:\n\"While on watch duty, I observed something unusual in the 2nd Company, 5th Squad.\"\n\n11. Field of Flowers (Same Night)\n\nThe instructor, Eisuke, and Kinoshita are walking.\nKinoshita says to the instructor:\n\"I cannot understand it. My family didn't inform me, the father, about my child's death.\"\nThe instructor remains silent for a moment, then <52> says:\n\"Actually, I also knew that your beloved son had passed away.\"\nKinoshita is shocked.\n\"What? How did you know, Instructor?\"\nInstructor: \"Mm, not just me. All the staff at the training center know.\"\nKinoshita, puzzled:\n\"What? So the other instructors all know too...\"\nInstructor: \"That's right. Everyone knows. The reason we didn't tell you was out of respect for your wife's words.\"\nKinoshita: \"My wife's words?\"\nInstructor: \"Yes. Your wife possesses truly admirable resolve as a Peninsula woman (半島婦人). I will never forget... the content of that letter from your wife was...\"\nAs if remembering, he takes out his notebook and reads quietly.\n\"'To the Commandant and Instructors, I hope this finds you well. Regarding my husband Kinoshita Tarō's eldest son, Kazuo, his medicine and treatment were ineffective, and he passed away today. As his wife, I feel deeply responsible for losing our precious child while my husband is away. Therefore, I thought first to inform my husband immediately, but I stopped myself. If I inform him of this during his important training, I fear it will dampen his hard-earned morale, so I will not tell him. When my husband's military spirit has truly settled within him, I intend to reveal it. Until then, Sirs, please, do not inform my husband of this matter.'\"\nKinoshita and Eisuke listen intently.\nInstructor: \"Do you understand now, Kinoshita?\"\nKinoshita: \"Yes.\"\nThe instructor, putting away his notebook:\n\"Isn't she a truly admirable wife of the military nation (軍國の妻)? Her words were so touching that I copied them into my notebook, intending to let you know when the time was right.\"\nKinoshita: \"I apologize. Unaware of the situation, I blindly resented my wife.\"\nHe says this, then to Eisuke:\n\"Squad Leader, please forgive my unmanly behavior tonight. However, as a father, when I heard of my child's death, I believe any human being would grieve. For a moment, I felt dizzy and almost collapsed, but I pulled myself together, thinking, 'What? I mustn't forget my duty as a soldier over something like this.' But regrettably, shedding tears was unbecoming of an Imperial soldier.\"\nHe continues:\n\"However, my tears were not tears of attachment to my dead child. My child was a child of Japan. It was the regrettable fact that we lost a Japanese boy that pained me again and again.\"\nEisuke gently puts his arm around Kinoshita's shoulder.\n\"No, I understand.\"\nThey start walking.\nEisuke: \"You and I are on the same path, moreover, companions from the same hometown, Puyŏ. I don't doubt your feelings. From now on, let's consult each other about everything.\"\nKinoshita: \"Yes, thank you.\" He nods firmly.\nEisuke: \"Since the march, your demeanor seemed different from usual, so I was vaguely concerned.\"\nKinoshita: \"I apologize.\"\nEisuke: \"Your wife must also be terribly worried. How her small, narrow woman's heart <53> must ache.\"\nKinoshita is silent.\nInstructor, with eyes full of sympathy:\n\"Perhaps Kinoshita should write a letter to his wife to cheer her up.\"\nEisuke: \"That's right. Tell her, 'Today, due to such-and-such reasons, I found out everything, but don't worry. Stay strong and guard the home front.' Write and send it tomorrow.\"\nHe pats Kinoshita's shoulder.\nKinoshita nods.\nInstructor: \"Alright, the night air is bad for you. Let's rest early tonight.\"\n\n12. Field Camp Site (Scene)\n\nThe 1st Company performs the heroic Imperial Subjects' Physical Exercise (皇國臣民體操). Part of the 2nd Company surrounds an instructor, listening emotionally to the story of First Class Private Yi In Sŏk's death in battle.\n\"I want to get to the front lines as soon as possible and avenge our senior!\"\n\"Yeah, my arms are itching for a fight!\"\nThe kitchen duty members are washing dishes in a small stream.\nEisuke is directing them.\nKinoshita is writing something at the tent.\nEisuke calls out to him.\n\"Hey, is it still not done? You're taking a ridiculously long time with that letter to your wife.\"\nKinoshita, embarrassed, stands up holding the paper and shows it.\nOther students also gather around Eisuke, saying \"Let me see, let me see,\" and peer at the paper.\nEisuke: \"Hey, hey, it's not a love letter. Stop it, stop it.\"\nHe looks through it.\n\"Good, good. Who knows how much relief this will bring your wife.\"\nEisuke suddenly looks puzzled.\nPart of the letter content:\n\"Only, the loss of XX, who was supposed to become a fine young man of the Empire in the future, was truly regrettable again and again.\"\nEisuke: \"What does this 'XX' mean?\"\nKinoshita: \"It's my child's name. If I wrote Kazuo (一夫), it would remind my family again, so I deliberately put XX.\"\nEisuke: \"Hmm, considerate of your wife. Excellent, excellent.\"\nOne of the volunteer soldiers chimes in from the side:\n\"Let me see it too!\"\nHe snatches it away and begins reading loudly.\n\"'To Kinoshita Fukujun. Are you not also a Japanese woman? Moreover, are you not the wife of a Japanese soldier? Just because misfortune struck the family while your husband was away, where is the need to hide it from your soldier husband? I learned of the misfortune from a friend's letter and also learned that you had sent a letter to the instructor.'\"\nKinoshita, embarrassed:\n\"Hey, give it back already.\"\nHe tries to grab it.\nThe surrounding students cheer:\n\"Yeah, yeah!\"\nThe student holding the letter runs away dodging,\nreading the continuation.\n\"'I won't speak of what's past. Only, the loss of XX, who was supposed to become a fine young man of the Empire in the future, was truly regrettable again and again.'\" <54>\nKinoshita finally catches up and snatches the letter back. Then he reproaches Eisuke.\n\"Squad Leader, that was mean! Embarrassing me like that.\"\nEisuke: \"Well, you're lucky just to have a kind wife you can send letters to.\"\nKinoshita: \"But Squad Leader, don't you sometimes receive letters from that young lady from the mainland (內地人)?\"\nOther students:\n\"Hey, hey, is that true? That's not cheap talk, Squad Leader!\"\nEisuke: \"What are you talking about? Don't misunderstand.\"\nHe starts to leave.\nEveryone follows him noisily.\n\"If you don't confess the truth, we'll misunderstand.\"\nEisuke: \"There's no truth or anything to it. That young lady from the mainland is the sister of a certain soldier who went to the front. Before I even entered the training center, I helped see off soldiers at Kyŏngsŏng Station (京城驛) for a while.\" WP (Wipe)\n\n13. Kyŏngsŏng Station Platform\n\nA train carrying soldiers departing for the front. Roar of cheers. Mainland Japanese and Korean women's groups (內鮮婦人團體) are giving enthusiastic service.\n\"Please fight hard for the country!\"\n\"Return safely and triumphantly!\"\n\"We pray for your victory!\"\nThe soldiers, looking energetic, lean out of the windows.\n\"Thank you, we'll do our best!\" they say one after another.\nAsano Mitsue and her friend Yi Paek-hŭi (李白姬) run onto the platform, peering into windows.\nDeparting soldier Asano Kenzō is chatting with a comrade.\nMitsue spots him.\n\"Brother!\" she calls.\nKenzō leans out at the voice.\n\"What, you just got here?\"\nMitsue, suddenly adopting a formal posture:\n\"Congratulations.\"\nKenzō receives it soldier-like.\n\"No, thank you.\"\nMitsue: \"This is my friend, Yi Paek-hŭi.\"\nKenzō: \"Ah, is that so?\"\nYi Paek-hŭi:\n\"Congratulations.\"\nKenzō receives the greeting again.\nMitsue takes a Senninbari (千人針 - thousand-stitch belt) from Paek-hŭi and hands it to Kenzō, \"Paek-hŭi made this for you.\" Kenzō bows once, accepts it, and says to Paek-hŭi:\n\"At various stations in Chōsen (朝鮮) and along the train lines, receiving unexpected cheers from the people of the Peninsula, we soldiers are actually moved to the point of being overwhelmed. Thank you, I'll accept this.\"\nHe reverently receives the Senninbari again.\nMitsue: \"How is the mainland (內地)?\"\nKenzō: \"Everyone's doing well. Have you improved your violin playing at all?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"When does school end?\"\n\"Very soon.\"\n\"Will you return to the mainland after graduation?\"\n\"I want to stay in Chōsen a bit longer. For now, I've decided to stay with my older sister in Puyŏ (扶餘).\"\nAt that moment, Kaneko Eisuke, neatly dressed in Korean attire (鮮服), walks by handing out charms (お守り) one by one to the soldiers, saying:\n\"Thank you, soldiers.\" <55>\nThe few charms quickly run out.\nKenzō extends a large hand.\n\"Thank you, brother.\"\nEisuke happily shakes his hand back.\n\"Please, do your best.\"\nKenzō: \"I'll carry the charm you gave me close. I'll give it to the unit commander and keep your pure feelings close to my heart.\"\nEisuke: \"Thank you.\"\nThe song for sending off departing soldiers can be heard.\nA wave of flags, voices cheering.\nEisuke leads the singing powerfully.\nThe departure bell rings.\nEisuke sings with a sincere face.\nKenzō takes out a small piece of paper.\n\"You, you!\"\nHe hurriedly calls Eisuke and hands him the paper.\nAmidst the cheers, the train begins to move.\n\"Banzai!\"\n\"Banzai!\"\nThe roaring voices echoed throughout the wide station.\nKenzō's figure recedes into the distance.\nMitsue and Paek-hŭi watch until he disappears.\nAnd Eisuke.\nEisuke opens the paper and looks.\nThe following was written on the paper:\n\"To the people of Chōsen, thank you. We will never forget this passionate welcome on the Peninsula. I don't need money going to the battlefield. I want you to use this for something useful. - A Soldier\"\nAnd inside was a neatly folded ten-yen bill.\n\n14. Inside the Patriotic Department (愛國部)\n\nEisuke making an entry in a ledger:\nOne item, ten yen. Anonymous.\n\n15. Chōsen Army Patriotic Department\n\nA sign for receiving national defense donations (國防獻金).\nEisuke, Mitsue, and Paek-hŭi come out.\nEisuke says to Mitsue:\n\"Soldiers are really wonderful people, aren't they? I'll soon be a soldier too.\"\nMitsue: \"Oh my.\"\nEisuke: \"I'm currently taking the exam for volunteer soldiers. If I can become one, perhaps someday I'll be able to meet your brother.\"\nMitsue looks back, seeming impressed.\nEisuke: \"Well then, excuse me here.\"\n\"Oh, is that so? Then goodbye.\"\nEisuke leaves briskly.\nMitsue watches him intently.\nWP (Wipe)\n\n16. Back at the Field Camp Site\n\nEisuke: \"That's all there is to it. So, has the misunderstanding cleared up?\"\nThe students nod.\nAnother one says:\n\"Still, that's nice.\"\nEveryone laughs.\n\n17. Physical Education and Music School Classroom\n\nMainland Japanese and Korean girls playing the cello (セロ).\nMitsue is there. Yi Paek-hŭi is there.\nThe teacher instructs them. <56>\n\n18. Gymnasium\n\nRhythmic training of the female students.\nInstructing them is the dancer, Madame Ch'oe (崔女史).\nA bell rings.\nTraining ends.\n\n19. Athletic Field\n\nFemale students from the physical education course gather around Madame Ch'oe.\nMitsue and Paek-hŭi, coming from the music classroom, come to greet Madame Ch'oe.\nWalking among the trees, Madame Ch'oe says:\n\"What I advocate is a movement to change the conventional way of thinking about female beauty.\"\nMadame Ch'oe continues:\n\"Especially for young women who will become mothers, there is the great role of giving birth and leaving strong descendants.\"\nMitsue and others gasp \"Wow!\"\nMadame Ch'oe speaks earnestly.\n\"This is something we really need to think about. Among highly educated young women, there are even those who prefer being single, saying it's easier, and dislike marriage. I don't think there's anyone like that among you, but that kind of thinking is truly outdated. In other words, they only consider their individual standpoint and don't think about what the nation currently demands of women.\"\nMitsue and others listen.\n\"Recently, the concept of female beauty has particularly changed. Healthy beauty, resilience, this is true beauty. The reason I give you strict training is because it is a form of discipline.\"\nYi Paek-hŭi says:\n\"That's right. When you think about the soldiers, you know...\"\nThe legs of the female students walking rhythmically.\n\n20. Streets of Kyŏngsŏng (京城)\n\nThe volunteer soldiers' brothers marching, the imposing sound of sturdy military boots. The magnificent sight of the orderly march.\nPeople on the street:\n\"Volunteer soldiers!\"\n\"Our soldiers!\"\nThey watch the march pass with expressions full of respect and affection.\n\n21. Nearby Area\n\nChildren were playing with marbles.\n\"Volunteer soldiers! Volunteer soldiers!\"\nThey start running.\nJust then, the noon siren sounds.\nThe volunteer soldiers, by the instructor's command, halt their march and begin silent prayer (默禱).\nThe children who started running also stop.\n\"Hey, it's time for silent prayer!\"\nOne says. The children all stop and begin silent prayer. A Peninsula man passing by. A child pulls the old man's sleeve and says in Korean:\n\"Grandfather, it's time for silent prayer.\"\nThe old man looks puzzled, \"Silent prayer?\"\nChild: \"Yeah, just once a day, you know. We pray for the repose of the heroic spirits (英靈) and the continued luck in battle (武運長久) of the soldiers at the front. It's timed with the noon siren.\"\nThe old man finally understands and begins to pray with a reverent feeling.\n\n22. Street\n\nVolunteer soldiers continue their silent prayer calmly. <57>\n\n23. Another Street\n\nEven Peninsula women balancing things on their heads and old men wearing traditional hats (カンムリ - kammuri?) are observing silent prayer.\nA stopped streetcar, passengers praying silently.\nThe siren stops.\nPeople start walking.\nThe streetcar starts moving.\n\n24. Original Street\n\nThe volunteer soldiers resume their march.\nHeroic chorus of the \"Walking Song\" (步く唄).\n\n25. Another Street\n\nReturning from the music school. Mitsue and Yi Paek-hŭi.\nThey come along lightly singing the \"Walking Song.\"\nDown the street, the volunteer soldiers' march approaches.\nPaek-hŭi:\n\"Oh, volunteer soldiers!\"\nMitsue: \"Oh, wonderful!\"\nThe two run towards the march.\nEisuke, leading the march and singing. Mitsue, running up, spots Eisuke and says to Paek-hŭi:\n\"Oh, that's him! The one who gave my brother the charm at Kyŏngsŏng Station.\"\nPaek-hŭi looks intently at Eisuke.\n\"That's right. He said something about volunteering then, I guess it really happened.\"\nUnaware, Eisuke and his group march past.\nPeople cheering the march, shouting \"Banzai! Banzai!\"\nMitsue, as if struck by emotion:\n\"Volunteer soldiers are so splendid.\"\nPaek-hŭi, as if struck by an idea:\n\"Hey, Asano-san, how about we go visit the training center this Sunday?\"\nMitsue: \"But...\"\nPaek-hŭi: \"Seeing that impressive march makes me want to actually see their life at the training center.\"\nMitsue finally decides:\n\"You're right. We also need to know about the lives of the Peninsula's soldiers.\"\nLooking back, the volunteer soldiers' march has already disappeared down the street.\nF.O (Fade Out)\n\n26. Volunteer Soldier Training Center\n\nF.I (Fade In) Kinoshita Tarō is cutting Yasumoto's hair.\nYasumoto keeps yelling:\n\"Hey, that hurts! Be a little gentler.\"\nKinoshita: \"Endure the pain, it's free anyway.\"\nHe clips away vigorously (バリバリ). Yasumoto winces and flinches.\nBeyond them, Chokoman Shimizu is cutting the hair of the large Yamamoto.\nShimizu, measuring Yamamoto's head size with his fingers:\n\"What an incredibly large area this head covers. Thanks to that, my precious Sunday is ruined.\"\nHe clips away (バリバリ). The clippers snag.\n\"Ah, it hurts!\"\nYamamoto jumps up.\n\"I've been putting up with quite a bit already!\"\nPanting, he wipes away tears.\nFrom the other side, a student approaches <58> Kinoshita.\n\"Kinoshita, there's a letter from your wife.\"\nKinoshita happily leaves the clippers caught in Yasumoto's hair and goes towards him.\nYasumoto lets out a scream.\n\n27. Inside the Squad Barracks\n\nEisuke supervising cleaning. Kinoshita comes up to him.\n\"Squad Leader, a reply came from my wife.\"\nEisuke: \"Ah, really?\"\nAs if it were his own matter, he takes the letter, says \"May I read it?\" and reads.\n\"'From your wife who misses you...' Huh? Hey Kinoshita, aren't you being quite adored?\"\nKinoshita scratches his head.\nEisuke reads.\n\"'It has been quite some time since I last wrote. Not receiving a letter from you for so long makes me terribly lonely.'\"\nThe surrounding students stop their work and listen intently. (The group from before.)\n\"'According to your letter, you learned about the child's death. I also didn't know what to do. But when you said to me, 'Are you not also a Japanese woman? How can you not inform your husband, who is away as a soldier, about something like a child's death?' I realized that until today, I truly lacked awareness as a Japanese woman. From now on, no matter what happens at home, I will inform you.\nHow happy I am that you have become a splendid Imperial soldier who is not surprised by anything. From now on, I too will study anew. I must study so as not to be ashamed as the wife of a soldier of the Great Japanese Empire.'\"\nEisuke says to Kinoshita:\n\"'I must study so as not to be ashamed as the wife of a soldier'—that spirit is good.\"\nKinoshita smiles.\n\"As a wife, she's quite a masterpiece.\"\nHe says this and takes a photograph from his pocket notebook to show Eisuke.\n\"This is my wife.\"\nEisuke: \"Wow, isn't she wonderfully stylish (シヤン - shan)?\"\nKinoshita: \"Oh, thank you. We got married quite early, you see.\"\nEisuke: \"When was that?\"\nKinoshita: \"Well, I was seventeen, so my wife was still fifteen.\"\nEisuke: \"That was a bit early, haha!\"\nThe two laugh.\nJust then, a student approaches Eisuke. \"Squad Leader, you have a visitor.\"\nEisuke: \"A visitor?\"\nStudent: \"Yes, an extremely beautiful young lady from the mainland.\"\nKinoshita: \"There she is! The person from the letters, right? The sister of the soldier going to the front...\"\nEisuke can't nod.\nKinoshita: \"Please introduce me too.\"\nHe follows.\nThe other students slowly raise their heads.\n\n28. Entrance to the Squad Barracks\n\nYamamoto is cutting Yasumoto's hair.\nA student comes up and whispers something to Yamamoto. Yamamoto puts down the clippers and leaves. <59>\nYasumoto: \"Hey you! Finish the job!\"\nHe cries out pitifully.\n\n29. Camp Courtyard\n\nEisuke and Kinoshita guiding Mitsue and Paek-hŭi.\nMitsue: \"It's very impressive, the training center... I was surprised when I came to see it.\"\nEisuke: \"You must have been more surprised by the distance, right? It's four ri (about 16 km) from Kyŏngsŏng.\"\nMitsue: \"How many volunteer soldiers are there now?\"\nEisuke: \"There are a thousand of us volunteer soldiers, and about thirty-five instructors.\"\nKinoshita: \"Generally, the year is divided into three terms, accommodating a thousand people each term, so three thousand are recruited. But this year, there were 150,000 applicants. The enthusiasm for volunteer soldiers on the Peninsula is immense.\"\nEisuke: \"These numbers alone should allow you to imagine how fervent the patriotism of us Peninsula people (半島人) is.\"\nMitsue: \"I understand. Since the Incident (referring to the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War), the movement for Imperialization (皇民化運動) on the Peninsula has become very active, hasn't it? I think it's truly admirable.\"\nEisuke: \"Thank you. We truly want people from the mainland to understand this. My motivation for becoming a volunteer soldier was also believing that we shouldn't let the youth of the mainland bear the full responsibility for this critical situation alone. We Peninsula people must take up arms and rise for the sake of the Empire. I believed this is the sincerity that accords with the sacred will of 'isshi dōjin' (一視同仁 - impartial benevolence).\"\nKinoshita: \"The youth of the Peninsula all firmly believe this. They are burning with the determination that they will guard the front lines of national defense in the future.\"\nPaek-hŭi: \"Truly, I too feel proud as a person of the Peninsula.\"\nEisuke: \"We are also proud. It's not that we are conceited, but suppose millions of young men are currently away at the front. That means the number of children born this year will decrease by that much. If the war drags on, we must assume the birth rate will decrease accordingly. Thinking about twenty or thirty years from now makes us worried. We believe that we Peninsula people should provide the replenishment. The volunteer soldier system is the first step. If we volunteer soldiers can fulfill our duties admirably, we have no doubt that this swelling patriotic spirit will surely bring about conscription on the Peninsula in the near future.\"\nMitsue is strongly moved by Eisuke's words. Behind them, a group of students comes crowding around to peek.\nEisuke: \"Although it's only a short four-month training, the disciplined life here has instilled in us a strong military spirit (軍國魂 - gunkoku damashii). The completion ceremony is soon, but thinking that we must part with our dear teachers makes me feel lonely already.\"\nMitsue: \"Are you graduating already?\"\nEisuke: \"Yes.\"\n\n30. Training Center Front\n\nThe words \"Volunteer Soldier 15th Year, 3rd Term Completion Ceremony\" (志願兵十五年三期修了式). The Japanese flag (日章旗 - Nisshōki) is fluttering.\n\n31.

Close-up on the characters \"Commandant Kaita\" (海田所長).\nThe final admonition given to the graduating students.\nHot tears glisten in the eyes of Eisuke and Kinoshita.\n(During the admonition, the part about successfully completing the training center and finally entering the army should be clearly recorded and cut to the next scene.)\n\n32. XX Unit Camp Courtyard\n\nThe imposing march of new recruits (初年兵).\nKaneko Eisuke, Kinoshita Tarō, Yasumoto, Shimizu, Yamamoto, faces flushed, march in their new Private Second Class uniforms.\n(This part should be directed dynamically.)\nTheir crisp demeanor.\nTheir sharp roll call.\nSoon, the Unit Commander's admonition.\n(Regarding the volunteer soldiers' resolve, mingling with mainlanders, the harmony of feelings between \"you and I\" - 君と僕)\nEisuke and the others listen attentively.\n\n33. Inside the Barracks\n\nSeveral cuts showing the military life and training of volunteer soldiers mixed with mainlanders. The last cut:\n(News arrives that they will soon be dispatched to the front lines. \"You and I\" leap up and raise shouts of joy.)\nF.O (Fade Out)\n\n34. Town of Puyŏ (扶餘)\n\nF.I (Fade In) A bus arrives. (Shot from inside the bus)\nTwo soldiers get off the bus; they are Kaneko Eisuke and Kinoshita Tarō.\n\n35. Puyŏ Shrine (扶餘神祠)\n\nEisuke and Kinoshita report their return home on leave.\n\n36. Puyŏ Shrine Construction Site (扶餘神宮御造營敷地)\n\nPeople performing labor service (勤勞奉公) in the sacred precinct. Mainland Japanese and Koreans, sweating profusely, drive sacred hoes into the ground. Eisuke and Kinoshita work among them.\nKinoshita looks happy.\n\"Haven't seen it for a while, the hometown has changed.\"\nEisuke: \"Mm, once Puyŏ Shrine (扶餘神宮) is completed, our hometown will become the Uji-Yamada City (宇治山田市) of Chōsen.\"\n\n37. Shrine Road (神宮道)\n\nEisuke and Kinoshita walking down.\n\"The family will be surprised by our sudden return home.\"\nKinoshita nods.\n\"They'll be surprised.\"\nElementary school children (國民學校) pass by and salute the two.\nThe two smile and return the salute.\nOne of the children stares intently at Eisuke.\n\"Hey! It's Kaneko-san! It's Eisuke-san!\"\nAnother child:\n\"Kinoshita Tarō is here too!\"\nSaying this, the children run off towards the town.\n\n38. Town of Puyŏ\n\nChildren run.\n\"The soldiers have come back!\" <61>\n\"Eisuke-san has come back!\"\n\n39. Another Street\n\nChildren run.\n\"Kinoshita Tarō-san has come back!\"\nThe number of children steadily increases.\nThe townspeople are surprised.\n\n40. Kaneko Eisuke's House\n\nA group of children bursts through the main gate.\n\"Auntie, Eisuke-san has come back!\"\n\"He came back as a great soldier!\"\nEisuke's mother comes out from the house.\nEisuke enters just then.\n\"Mother, I'm home.\"\nEisuke's mother looks at Eisuke with a puzzled face for a moment, then:\n\"Ah! Eisuke!\"\nShe exclaims in surprise in Korean.\nEisuke stands tall in military fashion, raises his right hand high, and says:\n\"I have just returned!\"\n\"Oh, you...\"\nHer face filled with joy, the mother says:\n\"You've come back, haven't you.\"\nSeeing her son, who has become so impressively changed, her aged eyes are already filled with tears.\nEisuke: \"Where's Father?\"\nJust then, from the study, with a cough, the shoji screen opens, and Eisuke's father, Kaneko Ryūhō (金子龍鳳), emerges holding a pipe (煙管 - kiseru).\n\"Father, I'm home.\"\nEisuke stands at attention and salutes.\n\"Oh.\"\nSeeing his son's drastically changed, imposing figure, the father looks completely taken aback.\n\n41. Bank of a Small Stream\n\nKinoshita Tarō's wife, Fukujun, is doing laundry. Children run up to her.\n\"Auntie's husband has come back!\"\n\"Uncle has come back as a splendid soldier!\"\nFukujun stands up as if doubting her ears, \"Eh?!\"\nKinoshita Tarō approaches from the distance.\nFukujun, forgetting herself:\n\"Darling!\"\nShe runs towards him.\nKinoshita too, impulsively:\n\"Fukujun!\"\nHe starts running.\nThe children watch.\nThe two run towards each other.\nFukujun instinctively clings to him:\n\"Darling!\"\nKinoshita lifts his wife's face and says sternly:\n\"Fukujun.\"\nFukujun, startled, steps back, reflecting on her husband's dignity.\n\"Welcome home.\" (In Korean)\nShe quietly bows her head.\nKinoshita receives the bow with a nod.\nThen the two smile at each other.\n\n42. Eisuke's House, Father's Room\n\nStill in uniform, Eisuke sits properly with hands on the floor before his father. Looking at Eisuke, the father speaks with a voice full of emotion <62> (Korean below): \"Well, you've become splendid. Truly splendid. There's nothing that makes me happier than my son becoming a Japanese soldier.\"\nThe mother adds from the side:\n\"If you were coming back, it would have been nice if you'd let us know beforehand.\"\nEisuke: \"Yes, it was sudden. Actually, I'm finally going to war.\"\nA tense atmosphere quickly filled the air.\nBoth the father's and mother's faces seemed to pale with shock.\nEisuke resolutely:\n\"My long-held wish has been granted, and I am finally departing for the front. Because of this, we Peninsula volunteer soldiers received special consideration, and I actually came back to say goodbye.\"\nThe father was silent for a moment, then said clearly:\n\"I see. I was prepared that this might happen someday. Having become a soldier, going to the front and standing on the battlefield is one's cherished desire.\"\nEisuke: \"Thank you. I truly apologize for not being able to show any filial piety to my aging father and mother.\"\nThe mother says firmly:\n\"Eisuke, what are you saying? Even if you don't fulfill your duty to your parents, please fulfill your loyalty (忠義 - chūgi) to His Majesty the Emperor. That is our wish.\"\nEisuke: \"Mother, I'm sorry.\"\nMother: \"Don't worry about things at home, alright? Go and achieve great deeds.\"\nEisuke: \"Mother!\"\nUnable to bear it, he covered his eyes with the sleeve of his uniform.\nThe mother, as if scolding:\n\"What are you crying about?\"\nEisuke: \"Mother, I'm crying because I'm happy. Actually, when I told you I was going to a battlefield where survival is uncertain, I thought you would surely worry. But instead, instead...\"\nHe sobs.\nThe mother, as if consoling:\n\"You're still a child, aren't you.\"\n\n43. Cemetery\n\nFukujun and Kinoshita Tarō arrive.\nA small, freshly mounded grave.\nThe new grave marker reads \"Grave of Kinoshita Kazuo\" (木下一夫之墓).\nFukujun offers the wildflowers she brought, pours fresh water, and places dumplings (團子 - dango) before the grave.\nKinoshita stared intently at the grave, gradually bowing his head. Eventually, he crouches there, stroking the earth, facing the grave:\n\"Kazuo, you must have been lonely, ending up like this while Father was away...\"\n\"I'm sorry,\"\nFukujun, unable to bear it:\n\"For letting the boy die while you were away. I don't know how I can apologize enough.\"\nKinoshita silently plays with the dirt.\nFukujun places her hands before the grave:\n\"Kazuo, your father has come back to see you. Look, he's become a splendid soldier. You must look closely at your father's figure.\"\nShe breaks down crying.\nKinoshita quietly comforts his wife.\n\"Don't cry. It was his lifespan, it can't be helped. <63> This child was born under an unlucky star.\"\nFukujun: \"But I wish I could have shown the boy your splendid figure just once. Surely the boy would have smiled and shown respect.\"\nThe evening sun sets beyond the grave.\n\n44. Town of Puyŏ\n\nF.I (Fade In) Dawn sky.\n\"Wasshoi! Wasshoi!\"\nThe energetic voices of young men.\nCamera pans down to the still-dark town of Puyŏ, where core youths (中堅靑年), led by Eisuke and Kinoshita, march briskly with farm tools on their shoulders.\n\n45. Kubo Ryōhei's House\n\nRyōhei's wife, Fusako, opens the shoji screen.\n\"Darling, isn't that sound...?\"\nKubo Ryōhei comes out.\n\"What could it be?\"\nFusako calls:\n\"Omoni! Omoni!\" (オモニ - calling the maid)\nThe maid, Myŏngsuk (明淑), comes out from the kitchen area.\nFusako points towards the sound.\n\"Go see what that is.\"\nMyŏngsuk: \"Yes, ma'am,\" and goes out.\n\n46. Nearby Street\n\nYouths led by Eisuke and Kinoshita.\nThey run past with spirited shouts of \"Wasshoi! Wasshoi!\"\n\n47. Eisuke's House Garden\n\nThe shouts are heard.\nAt a worship platform set up before a wooden marker indicating the direction of the Imperial Palace (宮城方位), Eisuke's elderly parents perform worship towards the East (遙拜). Finishing the worship, the father looks towards the sound.\n\"That Eisuke fellow, he should be resting his body.\"\nMother: \"He really is an energetic child.\"\n\n48. Kubo Ryōhei's House\n\nThe maid Myŏngsuk reporting to the Kubo couple.\n\"Ma'am, apparently two soldiers from Puyŏ returned yesterday, and they formed an early rising group (早起會) with the local youths.\"\nRyōhei: \"Early rising group?\"\nMyŏngsuk: \"Yes, and just now, a large group of them went off with hoes to cultivate a field.\"\n\n49. Fallow Land by the Paengma River (白馬江)\n\nEarth being turned over.\nHoes swung high.\nThe national song (國民歌謠) \"Asa\" (Morning) is sung in chorus. Eisuke leads the singing while swinging his hoe. The sweat-covered faces of the youths, face after face after face.\n\n50. Nearby Road\n\nKubo Ryōhei approaches carrying farm tools. A field where crops are already growing. Ryōhei stops and gazes towards the youths, then eventually enters the field and begins inspecting the crops.\nEisuke and Kinoshita come to check the crop growth. They see Ryōhei and bow.\n\"Is this your field?\" <64>\nRyōhei: \"Well, it's not exactly my field, but the river gradually silted up, and this area became vacant land, so I tried growing a little something for amusement.\"\nEisuke looks at the crops.\n\"I see. They are growing well.\"\nRyōhei: \"You gentlemen are soldiers, aren't you?\"\nEisuke and Kinoshita:\n\"Yes, sir, we are.\"\nRyōhei: \"I heard that two soldiers from Puyŏ had returned. Was that you gentlemen?\"\nEisuke: \"Yes, sir. We received leave to return home and bid farewell to our hometown.\"\nRyōhei: \"So you're finally going to the battlefield?\"\nThe two: \"Yes.\"\nRyōhei: \"Thank you for your hard work. Please do your best.\"\nEisuke: \"Yes, sir. As Peninsula people, we feel sincerely honored to be able to serve our country.\"\nRyōhei: \"No, it is we who must be grateful. Please stop by the museum later. I'll be there.\"\nEisuke: \"Thank you very much.\"\nHe starts heading towards where the others are working, then points to the area being reclaimed.\n\"Please use that area for some crops too. Everyone will reclaim it.\"\nRyōhei: \"Oh my, is that so?\"\nEisuke: \"I think potatoes would grow there...\"\nRyōhei: \"Potatoes would be fine.\"\nEisuke: \"It might not amount to increased food production, but getting close to the soil is the crucial thing. Actually, I returned yesterday, looked around the village, consulted with the youths, and decided to reclaim all the fallow land. So we started implementing it right away this morning.\"\nRyōhei is impressed.\n\"If that's the case, let me join in too.\"\nHe shoulders his farm tools and follows Eisuke and the others.\n\n51. Kubo Ryōhei's House\n\nOutside on the veranda, Fusako arrives. Facing inside the room:\n\"Mitchan, are you awake?\"\nMitsue's voice from inside the room:\n\"Yes, since a little while ago.\"\nMitsue opens the shoji and shows her face.\nYi Paek-hŭi's face appears from behind Mitsue.\nPaek-hŭi says to Fusako:\n\"Good morning.\"\nFusako receives the greeting, then:\n\"Did you sleep well?\"\nPaek-hŭi: \"Yes. Thank you for having us, arriving so suddenly.\"\nFusako: \"Not at all. It's the countryside, so we can't offer much hospitality, but please make yourselves comfortable.\"\nPaek-hŭi: \"Thank you very much.\"\nMitsue looks at the surrounding furnishings and says to Fusako:\n\"Sister's place, everything is Korean style, isn't it?\"\nFusako smiles.\n\"It's my husband's taste. Even with pickles, it has to be kimchi (キムチ) in our house.\"\nMitsue: \"Oh, really?\"\nAnd adds:\n\"Where's Brother-in-law?\"\nFusako: \"He went to the fields (野良 - nora).\"\nMitsue: \"To the fields? But Brother-in-law is the museum <65> director, isn't he?\"\nFusako nods.\n\"Even so, he says he feels restless if he doesn't go out to the fields once in the morning... He grew up in the countryside, you see.\"\nMitsue: \"Oh, that's just like Brother-in-law.\"\nFusako: \"Still, he seems very happy that you came. He said he'd give you a tour of Puyŏ himself today.\"\n\n52. Road Near the Riverbank\n\nYouths heading back, farm tools on their shoulders.\nRyōhei says to Eisuke:\n\"There's something I absolutely want to ask you today.\"\nEisuke: \"Yes? What is it?\"\nRyōhei: \"I want to show my relatives the historical sites related to *naisen ittai* (內鮮一體 - Japan-Korea Unification) in this capital of Paekche (百濟), Puyŏ. When you have time off from work, would you undertake this for me?\"\nEisuke: \"Reclaiming land, I'll take on any amount, but guiding... I'm not really...\"\n\n53. Kubo Ryōhei's House (Front)\n\nA mailman arrives.\n\"Kubo-san, mail.\"\nThe maid Myŏngsuk comes out.\nMailman: \"Is there someone named Asano Mitsue here?\"\nMitsue comes out.\n\"Yes, that's me.\"\nShe accepts it. The mailman leaves.\nFrom behind, Paek-hŭi, dressed, comes out with Fusako.\nFusako: \"Where from?\"\nMitsue: \"It's from my brother at the front.\"\nFusako: \"Oh. I hope Ken-chan is well.\"\nMitsue: \"My brother is strong. When I met him at Kyŏngsŏng Station last month, he was full of vigor.\"\nFusako: \"Really, we are just three siblings; we need him to be strong.\"\n\n54. Museum Garden\n\nMitsue hurries over to Ryōhei.\n\"A letter came from brother Kenzō!\"\nRyōhei: \"Oh, that's wonderful. Let me see.\"\nHe extends his hand.\n\"No, it came to me.\"\nMitsue takes the letter and starts to walk away.\nFusako:\n\"You could read it here.\"\nMitsue: \"Later.\"\nSaying that, she disappears into the museum.\nRyōhei watches her go.\n\"It's not like it's a secret message.\"\nHe says this, looks at Paek-hŭi, and adds:\n\"You should also take a look around inside.\"\nPaek-hŭi bows once and disappears into the building after Mitsue.\nRyōhei: \"Well then, perhaps I should send for Kaneko-san.\"\nHe says this and calls an attendant to send him on an errand.\nFusako, suspiciously:\n\"Kaneko-san? Who is that?\"\nRyōhei: \"Hmm, who do you think?\"\nFusako: \"I have no idea.\"\nRyōhei: \"He's a fine young man. I've completely fallen for him.\"\nFusako: \"What is it? You're being terribly <66> pretentious, aren't you?\"\nRyōhei laughs.\nFusako, curious:\n\"You could just tell me.\"\nRyōhei: \"Well, wait a moment. More importantly, Fusako...\"\nFusako: \"Yes?\"\nRyōhei: \"I'm thinking I'd like to arrange a good match for Mitsue.\"\nFusako: \"Oh my, do you have someone in mind?\"\nRyōhei: \"I do. I do, but unless there's considerable understanding, the discussion won't proceed.\"\nFusako: \"I don't know what it is, but it sounds quite complicated.\"\nRyōhei: \"Mm, once I explain it, it's nothing much, though.\"\nFusako: \"If it's someone you have confidence in, I don't think there's any mistake. But we need to ascertain her feelings too, right?\"\nRyōhei: \"If she says yes, will you proceed?\"\nFusako: \"Yes, although I suppose I'll have to consult with her uncle on the mainland first... Since I'm the eldest, well, I'm like a parent.\"\n\n55. Nearby Road\n\nEisuke approaches with the museum attendant.\n\n56. Original Location\n\nRyōhei:\n\"There he is. That's the man.\"\nFusako: \"Oh my, is he a soldier?\"\nRyōhei: \"Mm, his name is Kaneko Eisuke. A splendid young man.\"\nJust then, Eisuke approaches.\nRyōhei introduces Fusako.\n\"Kaneko-san, this is my wife.\"\nEisuke salutes Fusako.\n\"I am Kaneko Eisuke.\"\nRyōhei calls towards the museum.\n\"Hey, Mitchan!\"\nMitsue's voice from inside:\n\"Yeees!\"\nRyōhei: \"Come out here.\"\nMitsue and Paek-hŭi come out.\nKaneko Eisuke sees the two.\nMitsue, surprised by the unexpected encounter:\n\"Oh, Kaneko-san!\"\nEisuke too: \"Was it Asano-san?\"\nMitsue: \"Thank you for that time.\"\nEisuke: \"No, likewise.\"\nThe Kubo couple watches, dumbfounded.\nMitsue, looking intently at Eisuke:\n\"So you finally enlisted.\"\nEisuke: \"Yes. I'll be departing for the front soon, so I was granted leave to return home. Yesterday, I returned to my parents' home to bid farewell.\"\nMitsue: \"Oh, your hometown was Puyŏ? Congratulations.\"\nEisuke receives the compliment with a bow.\nRyōhei says to Eisuke:\n\"It's become rather funny to introduce you now, but Kaneko-san, this is my wife's younger sister.\"\nHe introduces Mitsue.\nEisuke: \"Is that so? Actually, we met by chance in Kyŏngsŏng.\"\nRyōhei: \"Is that so? Young people these days... no, well, what I mean is...\"\nHe laughs heartily (ハツハツ - hatsu hatsu).\nEisuke asks Mitsue: <67>\n\"Have you heard anything from your brother since then?\"\nMitsue takes out the earlier letter.\n\"Yes, a letter today...\"\nFusako asks:\n\"What did it say?\"\nMitsue: \"He seems very well.\"\nRyōhei: \"Well, read it for us.\"\nMitsue: \"Me? No, I don't want to.\"\nRyōhei: \"What's there to not want? Don't say things unlike you. Here, let me read it.\"\nHe takes the letter from Mitsue and begins to read.\n\"'Just arrived at XX. I imagine you are also at sister's place in Puyŏ by now. Is everyone well in Puyŏ? Brother-in-law, the museum director, is probably discoursing on *naisen ittai* as usual. In fact, through this deployment, I too have rediscovered the Peninsula. People currently living on the mainland need to have a more understanding eye towards the Peninsula. Our ancestors already achieved the reality of *naisen ittai* centered around Puyŏ 1,300 years ago. This is clearly shown in history. Brother-in-law, the museum director, is probably an expert in this area, so I'll omit it...'\"\nRyōhei strokes his chin while reading.\nMitsue and Fusako laugh.\nRyōhei continues reading.\n\"'Even at the front, our brothers from the Peninsula are performing their duties in the Holy War (聖戰 - seisen) well. Every time I recall the send-offs at every station on the Peninsula during our journey to the front, and the waves of flags waved with fervent sincerity by the women in white robes (白衣 - hakui), we soldiers feel ready to give our lives.'\"\nEisuke listens intently.\nRyōhei's reading voice continues further.\n\"'Especially at Kyŏngsŏng Station, the figure of that noble young man who walked around handing us charms, saying 'Soldiers, we're counting on you,' 'Thank you for your trouble,' 'Thank you, thank you,' is somehow unforgettable to me.'\"\nMitsue suddenly raises her face and watches Eisuke.\nEisuke listens intently.\nRyōhei continues reading further.\n\"'I gazed intently at that young man's figure, listened to his words overflowing with sincerity, and saw his earnest face. Overcome with emotion, I wrapped a ten-yen bill in paper and handed it to that young man, asking him to use it for something useful.'\"\nEisuke gradually feels moved.\nRyōhei's voice takes on heat.\n\"'It wasn't that I thought I could buy that young man's heart with a mere ten yen. It was solely my desire to convey a fraction of my heartfelt, truly sincere gratitude to that young man. I will fight with all my might. For the sake of that Peninsula youth, even if I fall to an enemy bullet tomorrow, I feel I can die smiling. That's the kind of feeling I even have.'\"\nTears well up in Eisuke's eyes.\nTrying not to let them be seen, he moves away from the spot.\nEveryone looks towards Eisuke.\nMitsue: \"Is the young man mentioned in my brother's letter... him?\"\n\"Eh?!\"\nThe Kubo couple is surprised.\nMitsue: \"At Kyŏngsŏng Station, the one who gave charms to my brother and the others was him. It was before he became a soldier, wasn't it, Paek-<68>hŭi-san?\"\nPaek-hŭi: \"That's right. It's strange to meet him here like this.\"\nEmotion colors the faces of the Kubo couple.\nWP (Wipe)\n\n57. Road to Sasŏllu (泗泚樓)\n\nEisuke guiding Mitsue and Paek-hŭi.\nThe sound of string instruments.\nLooking up, on Sasŏllu, four or five young women are enjoying the cool air, bringing out kotos (琴) and changgus (長鼓 - janggu), singing elegant old songs. The three stop and listen for a while.\nMitsue asks Eisuke:\n\"What song is that?\"\nEisuke: \"That's a passage from Kwanghallu (廣寒樓) in the Tale of Ch'unhyang (春香傳). It's like a Korean nagauta (長唄 - long epic song).\"\n\n58. Kubo House Veranda\n\nFusako:\n\"Is that Kaneko-san the one you meant?\"\nRyōhei: \"That's right.\"\nFusako: \"But the surname is different, isn't it?\"\nRyōhei: \"What are you talking about? Do names like the old-style Kim-san or Pak-san still exist in Chōsen these days?\"\nFusako: \"Ah, he changed his name under *sōshi-kaimei* (創氏)?\"\nRyōhei: \"That's right. Honestly, you've been on the Peninsula for five years now, what are you going to do being like this?\"\nFusako: \"I'm sorry.\"\nRyōhei: \"But he's a good young man, isn't he?\"\nFusako: \"He seems nice.\"\nRyōhei: \"Mitsue doesn't seem entirely indifferent either, does she?\"\nFusako: \"Basically, that girl has absolutely no prejudice...\"\nRyōhei: \"She's straightforward. That's why her face is bright.\"\nFusako: \"But, because of the family registry (籍 - koseki) and things, what will her uncle in the countryside say?\"\nRyōhei: \"If there's opposition, I'll persuade him. Like in the letter earlier, mainlanders need to extend a warmer hand.\"\nFusako: \"People on the mainland truly have few opportunities to know the real goodness of Chōsen. That's why the further into the countryside you go, the more issues like the family registry become a problem.\"\nRyōhei: \"That's why those of us who understand Chōsen must first practice it ourselves and eliminate such old customs. Otherwise, *naisen ittai* will forever remain just a slogan. Practice first, before arguing theory. If the Family Register Law is revised, I intend to change my registered domicile (原籍 - honseki) to Ch'ungch'ŏngnamdo (忠淸南道). You should also make up your mind firmly.\"\nFusako: \"Yes, yes.\"\nRyōhei: \"By the way, do you know who the deities enshrined at Puyŏ Shrine are?\"\nFusako: \"Yes, of course I know.\"\nRyōhei: \"Then I'll ask.\"\nFusako: \"Emperor Ōjin, Empress Saimei, Emperor Tenji, and Empress Jingū, the four enshrined deities, right?\"\nRyōhei, beaming:\n\"Impressive! Just as expected of my wife. But why are these deities specifically enshrined in Puyŏ?\"\nFusako laughs.\n\"Well, it's not like a children's test. Isn't that summed up in the single phrase you always talk about, *naisen ittai*?\"\nRyōhei laughs heartily. Then, <69>\n\"By the way, you know, *naisen* marriage seems to be very good eugenically. I hear the Ministry of Health and Welfare (厚生省) and the General Mobilization League (總力聯盟 - likely the Kokumin Sōryoku Chōsen Renmei 國民總力朝鮮聯盟) are especially encouraging *naisen* marriage.\"\nFusako: \"Oh, is that true?\"\nRyōhei: \"Yes, it's apparently shown in statistics. They say good children, and many of them, are born. There's no better news than this.\"\nFusako: \"Can they even have triplets (三ツ兒), which are popular now?\"\nRyōhei: \"Triplets, I don't know about that... But right now, this population problem is critical for our country. At twenty-three, Mitsue shouldn't be idling around.\"\nFusako: \"So, darling, did you ask that Kaneko-san about his intentions?\"\nRyōhei: \"Oops, I forgot to ask that. But I'll take responsibility for arranging that, so you try to persuade Mitsue.\"\nFusako: \"Oh my, what a troublesome matchmaking task.\"\nThe two laugh.\n\n59. Paengma River (白馬江)\n\nEisuke, Mitsue, and Paek-hŭi letting a boat drift.\nThe boatman sings a song tinged with sorrow.\nNakhwaam Rock (落花巖) and Paekhwajŏng Pavilion (百花亭) recede into the distance.\nEisuke explains.\n\"That rock is the famous Nakhwaam. It's the historical site where three thousand court ladies of Paekche (百濟), deeming it dishonorable to surrender to the armies of Tang and Silla (唐·新羅), threw themselves into this Paengma River and scattered like blossoms.\"\nMitsue and Paek-hŭi listen.\nFlowing water.\nThe boatman's song.\nEisuke: \"The song the boatman is casually singing now is the folk song of the 'Three Thousand Falling Flowers' (落花三千 - Nakka Sansen). It evokes the pitiful scene of that time, doesn't it?\"\nMitsue listened intently to the song.\n\"Korean songs generally have a sorrowful tone, don't they?\"\nEisuke: \"That's not true. Of course, songs like Arirang (アリラン) or Toraji (トラヂ), which have a melancholic tone similar to Sado Okesa on the mainland, are easy to catch on to and thus familiar to everyone. But old Korean songs are absolutely, extremely bright. For example, Yangsando (陽山道), or 'Yangsando' in the local language, such folk songs have even become symphonies and have splendid melodies.\"\nMitsue: \"Won't you let us hear one?\"\nEisuke: \"That's difficult. I'm not very good at it.\"\nHe asks the boatman to sing.\nThe boatman replies in Korean, \"It's better if you sing,\" and declines.\nMitsue teases, \"That's unfair, Kaneko-san.\"\nEisuke: \"Well, since you ask, shall I try singing an imitation?\"\nEisuke sings \"Yangsando.\"\nThe boatman takes out a changgu from inside the boat, slings it over his back, and adds rhythmic interjections, \"Chotta! Chotta!\" (ジョッター〱).\nThe scene is so amusing that Mitsue and Paek-hŭi are drawn in and also add the interjections.\nCarried by Eisuke's song, the boat drifts down the long Paengma River. F.O (Fade Out)\n\n60. Outside the Kubo Family Bathhouse (Evening) <70>\n\nF.I (Fade In) Inside the bath, Mitsue and Paek-hŭi seem to be bathing, using the water and singing \"Yangsando,\" which they just learned from Eisuke, in Japanese.\nMitsue's voice:\n\"What does 'Chotta' mean?\"\nPaek-hŭi's voice:\n\"It's an interjection meaning 'Good!' or 'Alright!'\"\nMitsue's voice:\n\"Oh, I see. That's why it has feeling.\"\nFusako comes outside the bathhouse and asks:\n\"Mitchan, how's the water temperature?\"\nMitsue's voice:\n\"It's just right.\"\nFusako: \"Yi-san, make sure you warm up well too.\"\nPaek-hŭi's voice:\n\"Yes, thank you very much. Are you already out? Asano-san, excuse me.\"\nPaek-hŭi comes out.\nFusako: \"My, a quick dip like a bird.\"\nPaek-hŭi: \"I tend to get lightheaded easily.\"\nShe heads towards the rooms.\nInside the bath, Mitsue hums carefreely.\nFusako tidies up the nearby laundry basket and other items, calling out:\n\"Hey, Mitchan, what do you think of Kaneko-san?\"\nMitsue: \"He's a very nice person.\"\nFusako, smiling slyly:\n\"Ah, really? So you like him?\"\nMitsue's laughter:\n\"Sister, don't say strange things.\"\nFusako also laughs.\n\"But Kubo is really rooting for Kaneko-san. He says he wants to make him your groom.\"\nMitsue laughs.\n\"I'm not getting married or anything.\"\nFusako: \"Not getting married?\"\nMitsue's voice: \"No.\"\nFusako: \"Why... don't you want to?\"\nMitsue's voice:\n\"It's still too early. Besides, isn't he a soldier going to the battlefield now?\"\nFusako, encouragingly:\n\"Yes, of course. This isn't about something happening suddenly right now. It's about the future, anyway. But what are your feelings? Please tell me the truth, just between us.\"\nMitsue's voice:\n\"I don't know.\"\nFusako: \"Troublesome child. And you're already twenty-three.\"\nMitsue's voice:\n\"But I don't understand things like that. Please do as you think best, Sister.\"\nFusako's face overflows with joy.\n\"As I think best?\"\nMitsue's voice:\n\"Yes. Sister should understand my feelings.\"\nFusako, in a buoyant voice:\n\"Ah, okay, I understand, I understand.\"\nA look of relief on her face.\nRyōhei's voice from the other side:\n\"Hey! There's no more left!\" (Referring to sake?)\nFusako: \"Yeees! Coming!\"\nShe leaves the spot.\n\n61. Detached Room\n\nRyōhei and Eisuke are drinking a little. <71>\nFusako enters with a sake server (銚子 - chōshi).\n\"Here you go.\"\nShe offers it to Eisuke.\nEisuke: \"No, I can't drink anymore.\"\nRyōhei: \"Nonsense! How can a fine young man say he can't drink? We don't have much, but tonight, please accept my farewell toast. Come on.\"\nEisuke bows slightly.\n\"But if I drink, I'll get drunk.\"\nRyōhei: \"Getting drunk is even better. Please get drunk. Your house isn't that far, I'll see you home.\"\nEisuke reluctantly accepts the cup. Fusako pours.\nRyōhei asks Fusako:\n\"Fusako, how did it go? Was it successful...?\"\nFusako, looking pleased:\n\"Well, of course, I...\"\nRyōhei, satisfied:\n\"Mm, I see.\"\nFusako: \"That tomboy just kept saying noncommittal things...\"\nRyōhei: \"Haha, is that so? By the way, Kaneko-san, no, Eisuke-san, there's something I absolutely must ask you.\"\nEisuke: \"Yes? What could it be?\"\nRyōhei: \"I think you might be pleased about it too... but let's leave that for later. This morning, you mentioned planting potatoes in that reclaimed land. I'd like to state my opinion about those potatoes.\"\nEisuke: \"Please do.\"\nRyōhei: \"Fusako, you listen too.\"\nFusako: \"Yes, yes.\"\nRyōhei: \"The word 'imo' (芋 - potato/yam) generally means 'woman.' That is, just as women multiply descendants, the word comes from the way potatoes also produce child potatoes and grandchild potatoes and multiply.\"\nFusako: \"It's complicated, isn't it?\"\nRyōhei, looking pleased:\n\"Well then, skipping the difficult parts, potatoes, you see, are in every sense the representative type of national policy food (國策食物 - kousaku shokumotsu). Isn't that right?\"\nEisuke: \"That's right.\"\nRyōhei: \"Isn't it? Then the relationship between humans and potatoes has an inseparable fate, doesn't it? Therefore, you see, potatoes that produce many child and grandchild potatoes are also good potatoes, and it's the same for humans. It was in the newspaper sometime ago about a couple having sixteen children, but even if sixteen is special, about five are necessary, wouldn't you say?\"\nEisuke: \"That's right. Therefore, Kubo-san, you too should quickly have children...\"\nRyōhei: \"No, when you say that, it's painful for me. It's been a lifelong failure, you see. Hey, Fusako, we are several steps inferior to potatoes, aren't we? Hahaha!\"\nFusako: \"That's why, in our family, we're pinning our hopes on Mitsue for that, aren't we?\"\nRyōhei: \"Right, right. We have Mitsue. By the way, what happened to Mitsue? Still in the bath?\"\nFusako: \"No, I think she's already out.\"\n\n62. Mitsue's Room\n\nMitsue is dressing Paek-hŭi in her own kimono. Finishing the dressing, Mitsue says:\n\"It suits you very well, Paek-hŭi-san. Won't you come be my brother's bride?\"\nPaek-hŭi: \"Oh my.\"\nMitsue adjusts the obi slightly. <72>\n\"It would be nice if the ladies here would wear wafuku (和服 - Japanese clothing) more often.\"\nPaek-hŭi: \"Yes, but dressing and everything is difficult, right? That's why it's embarrassing.\"\nMitsue: \"I wear Korean clothes (朝鮮服 - Chōsenfuku) without hesitation. They're very nice. If you think it's embarrassing, you can't do anything.\"\nShe picks up Paek-hŭi's clothes from the hanger (衣桁 - ikō).\nPaek-hŭi quickly helps Mitsue get dressed this time.\n\n63. Detached Room\n\nRyōhei: \"By the way, Kaneko-san.\"\nEisuke: \"Yes.\"\nRyōhei hesitates, about to bring it up.\n\"No, thank you very much for your trouble today.\"\nRyōhei wipes sweat, uncharacteristically.\nEisuke: \"Not at all.\"\nFusako glares at Ryōhei impatiently.\nRyōhei signals her, \"You go over there.\"\nEisuke senses the slightly odd atmosphere and looks at Ryōhei.\nRyōhei quickly says:\n\"No, please excuse my rudeness.\"\nFusako leaves the room.\nEisuke: \"Is something wrong?\"\nRyōhei: \"No, well, I was thinking of boasting just a little.\"\nEisuke: \"Please tell me.\"\nRyōhei: \"Well then, I'll say it. It's about Mitsue.\"\nEisuke, flustered:\n\"Huh?\"\nRyōhei: \"She's a dear girl.\"\nEisuke: \"Huh?\"\nRyōhei: \"She's already twenty-three, but there's still something childlike about her.\"\nEisuke: \"Ah.\"\nRyōhei: \"Because she has a good nature, there are various proposals, but what do you think?\"\nEisuke: \"Going by Kubo-san's pet theory, you should marry her off quickly.\"\nRyōhei: \"However, you see, it really depends on the partner. A person isn't great just because they have money. They aren't great just because they have education. The key is sincerity (眞心 - magokoro). To someone who possesses sincerity, I would gladly give her away.\"\nEisuke: \"That's wonderful.\"\nRyōhei: \"You reply indifferently as if it's someone else's business, but what about you?\"\nEisuke, startled:\n\"What about me?\"\nRyōhei: \"Are you dissatisfied?\"\nEisuke: \"With what?\"\nRyōhei: \"Playing dumb really troubles me. How about you becoming Mitsue's groom? That's what I'm asking.\"\nEisuke sits up straight, firmly.\n\"Thank you very much. I had no idea you had such intentions, so please excuse my previous rudeness.\"\nRyōhei: \"No, please don't be so formal.\"\nEisuke, seriously:\n\"It may seem like I'm returning your words, and I apologize, but firstly, I am not qualified to receive your sister. As you know, I am going to the battlefield, so I do not expect to return alive.\"\nRyōhei: \"No, I understand that well. This isn't\na discussion about something immediate. It's about after you return <73> triumphantly and safely.\"\nEisuke is silent for a moment. Eventually:\n\"I fear that everyone's kindness towards me might actually become a heavy burden.\"\nRyōhei: \"You think too much. If that were the case, then all soldiers wouldn't be able to have wives. Dying isn't the only form of loyalty, you know. The battlefield isn't the only place people die... You don't need such worries. I want you, Kaneko-san, to become Mitsue's groom. Please get along well. The discussion has just begun, and this is for the future, but still, if I don't ask now, who knows when we'll be able to meet again.\"\nEmotion flickers in Eisuke's eyes.\nRyōhei: \"By the way, what happened to the essential Mitsue? Hey, Fusako!\"\nFusako's voice:\n\"Yes, yes, coming!\"\nRyōhei: \"Coming? That Fusako is getting carried away.\"\nJust then, Fusako enters with Mitsue in Korean dress (鮮服) and Paek-hŭi in Japanese dress (和服).\nRyōhei's eyes widen involuntarily.\nMitsue spreads her sleeves.\n\"How is it, Brother-in-law? Doesn't it suit me?\"\nRyōhei's face breaks into a smile.\n\"Of course it suits you! Go sit over there for a moment.\"\nMitsue obediently sits near Eisuke.\nRyōhei: \"You look like Kaneko-san's bride.\"\nMitsue: \"Oh stop it, Brother-in-law, don't tease.\"\nRyōhei: \"No, I'm not teasing. As thanks for today, pour Kaneko-san a drink.\"\nMitsue turns formally to Eisuke.\n\"Thank you very much indeed.\"\nShe bows and pours sake.\nEisuke accepts.\nWatching them intently, Ryōhei says to Fusako.\n\"I want to live a long life. Truly live long, long, and watch over everyone's future.\"\nFusako nods quietly.\nRyōhei: \"We may not be overly comfortable, but isn't it enjoyable to think that through our efforts, we can make the young people happy?\"\nFusako: \"Truly.\"\n\n64. Night Road\n\nThe moon is out.\nEisuke and Mitsue walk side-by-side down the quiet night road.\nThey just walk in silence.\nThe night breeze plays with Mitsue's skirt (裳 - chima/mo).\nEisuke whistles.\nMitsue quietly hums along to the tune of \"Kimi to Boku\" (君と僕 - You and I).\nEventually, Eisuke sings.\nA duet.\n\n65. Eisuke's House Garden\n\n(The music from the previous scene suddenly changes tempo here, becoming a lively, bustling melody of a Korean festival - 朝鮮祭禮)\nVillagers dance wildly, filling the garden.\nEisuke's family watches.\nEisuke's father looks satisfied, calling out \"Chotta! Chotta!\" <74> (ジョッター〱) in time with the music.\nA beautiful celebratory dance (祝舞 - iwaimai) by the village maidens.\nThe Kubo Ryōhei couple, Mitsue, and Paek-hŭi are also present.\nThe Kinoshita couple is also there.\nEisuke says to Mitsue:\n\"Seeing the villagers celebrate our departure for the front like this... makes me feel the duty of us volunteer soldiers is increasingly heavy.\"\nMitsue: \"That's right. I want you to do your best.\"\nKinoshita responds to that:\n\"We'll fight hard, Asano-san.\"\nA charming celebratory dance by the village children.\nThe onlookers all clap involuntarily.\nWhen it finishes, stepping forward briskly before Eisuke and Kinoshita is Elder Sŏngjun (成俊老人). His usually stern, ancient warrior-like face breaks into a smile.\n\"I pray for your continued luck in battle (武運長久).\"\nHe bows respectfully.

F.O (Fade Out) <75>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis screenplay, \"You and I,\" depicts the journey of Korean volunteer soldiers (志願兵) joining the Japanese Imperial Army in 1941. It follows two main characters, Kaneko Eisuke and Kinoshita Tarō, from their final training exercises, through personal hardships (like Kinoshita learning belatedly of his son's death, withheld to protect his morale), to their emotional farewells in their hometown of Puyŏ before heading to the front. The narrative strongly emphasizes the supposed patriotic fervor of Koreans volunteering for service, their assimilation into the Japanese military structure, the ideal of *naisen ittai* (Japan-Korea unification), and the unwavering loyalty to the Emperor, portraying their military service as a noble duty and honor.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, this screenplay is a significant artifact of Japanese colonial propaganda during wartime. It showcases the efforts to promote the volunteer soldier system among Koreans, frame their participation as enthusiastic and voluntary loyalty to Japan, and reinforce the *naisen ittai* ideology to legitimize colonial rule and mobilize colonial subjects for the war effort. Historians would find the portrayal of Korean characters' motivations, the depiction of interactions between Koreans and mainland Japanese, the emphasis on imperial ideology (Emperor worship, patriotism, military spirit), and the manufactured narrative of harmonious assimilation particularly revealing about the propaganda strategies employed by the Japanese authorities in Korea during this period.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n金子英助\tかねこえいすけ\tKaneko Eisuke\n木下太郞\tきのしたたろう\tKinoshita Tarō\n淺野美津枝\tあさのみつえ\tAsano Mitsue\n久保良平\tくぼりょうへい\tKubo Ryōhei\n久保房子\tくぼふさこ\tKubo Fusako\n淺野謙三\tあさのけんぞう\tAsano

戰場\n\n一個分隊程の匍匐前進(移動)＜48＞\n煙幕が流れ、銃聲が轟き、砲彈が土煙りを上げる。その中を分隊はしやにむに匍匐前進を續ける。\n先頭を匍匐する李仁錫(移動大寫)決死の顔。前方を凝視して、手榴彈を投げつける。\n支那軍の塹壕。チエツコ機銃と支那兵がすつ飛ぶ。\n分隊は三宅分隊長の突つこめ！叫び聲と共に李を先頭にして猛然と突つこむ。\n分隊は敵の火點を占領する。そしてその地點に經機をすヘて反擊して來る敵に激しく擊ちはじめる。(國旗を振つて後方に合圖をしてもよし) 後方の友軍の突擊ラツパが聞へはじめる。\n突然、分隊の附近(カメラと分隊の中間)に迫擊砲彈落下。砂煙はしばし分隊の姿を消す。\nその煙りの中に三宅分隊長の聲がする\n「皆、大丈夫―山田！今井！小西！內田！」\nそれぞれ元氣な答へが聞へるが\n「李！李仁錫！李はどうした！」\n李の答へはない。次第に煙りが薄らいで行く(その流れの如くカメラ前進移動)\n重傷を負つた李は三宅分隊長に抱きかゝへられてゐる。\n「しつかりしろ！李仁錫！李仁錫！」\n「この位の傷、なんでもないぞ！元氣を出せ！」\nやがて、靜に目を見開い李は、かすかではあるがしつかりした口調で\n「天皇陛下―萬歲」\nと叫ぶ(銃聲と突擊の響の底から「海ゆかば」の音樂が遠く低く李をつゝむ樣に聞へて來る)\n三宅分隊長と兵士は絕望の視線を合せる。\n「李！何か云ひ殘すことはないか」\nと分隊長が聞くのに對して、李は「自分はこのまゝ死んでも半島靑年として恥しくはないでせうか」と聞く、三分隊長は「立派だぞ、立派な日本國民の最後だぞ」と言ふ\n李は滿足な微笑みをたゝえる。\nそして段々死に近づきながら\n「志願兵訓練所の所長殿 敎官殿によろしく」\nと悲壯な遺言をする。\n(海行かば は次のシーンまで續いて行く)\n\n註\n此の場面の演出は次の項を參照すベし\n李仁錫所屬隊況の槪要\n所屬 木越部隊竹鼻隊畑野隊\n戰死日時 昭和十四年六月二十二日午后七時\n戰死場所

訓練所の營庭\n\n行軍に出發すべき一個中隊程の生徒を圓陣に集めて敎官(大日方)が話してゐる\n「李は斯く如く立派に戰死した。」\nこの李の愛國精神は即ち當訓練所の精神である。\nおそれ多くも今度の行賞に於て李の勳功はよみせられ日本國民最高の榮譽である金鵄勳章をたまわつたのである。\n君恩のあまねきこと斯の如くである。何の御差別もなく國民の上にひとしくたれ給ふのである。\n君恩を忘れるな。そして「み民われ」の精神に生きよ。\nこの君恩を忘れず「み民われ」の精神に終始することが即ち當訓練所の精神であり、當訓練所を卒業したるお前達の先輩李仁錫の精神でもあつたのである。\nお前達は旬日ならずして訓練所を卒業しいよいよ光榮ある帝國軍人として入營するのであるが只今より最終の訓練行軍を開始するにあたつて、以上訓話を行ひあらためてお前達の國民精神を喚起したのである。終り！」\n以上の樣な訓話を行なひ、敬禮を受ける\n「出發の命令、行進ラツパはじまる」\n\nプロローグ

柳の茂つた街道\n\nF·I\n志願兵全生徒が勇壯な軍歌を歌ひながら行軍してゐる。\nみんなの顔には、はちきれさうな嬉しさが充ち滿ちてゐる。\n志願兵甲が隣の乙に訊く。\n「お前訓練所を卒業したら何處へ志望する」\n甲「俺は滿洲の守備隊へ行く」\n丙「俺は斷然第一線を志望するな」\n甲が向ふの列に向つて呼ぶ。\n「おい、運ちやん」\n振り返つたのは運轉手あがりの安本である。安本むつとして\n「運ちやんはよせ。それは昔は自動車の運ちやんだつたが、今は立派な志願兵ぢやないか。兵隊に向つて運ちやんとは何事だ。」\nといきまく。\n甲「いやすまん〱。時に安本、お前はやはり自動車隊に入るんだらうな」\n安本「いや、俺は今度タンクに乘るぞ」\nそりかへる。一同「ほう」と目を瞠はる。\n安本 他の列に向つて\n「おいチヨコマン」\n呼ばれた。チヨコマンと運名のある小柄な生徒淸水が「何ですか」と進返る、\n安本 「俺がタンクに乘る時はな、お前はチヨコマンだから一緒に乘せてやるよ」\n淸水「體はチヨコマンでも、自分は大砲を射つ方へ廻ります」\n先頭の金子英助が笑つて\n「これは安本の負けた。チヨコマンの淸水と云へば士氣旺盛な點では、訓練所＜50＞中で有名だからな。」\n甲が\n「何しろ背の小さい癖に志願して、何回もはねられたんですが最後の體格檢査ぢやとう〱足をのばして無理矢理に合格したんですよ。」\nみんなクス〱笑ふ。\nチヨコマンの淸水照れ隱しに、\n「あの山本を見て下さい。ダラシのない奴ですよ」\n一同その方を見る。\n肥つた山本フーフー云ひながら汗をかいてゐる。\n淸水「あの圖體で志願兵になりたいばつかりに、每朝二里半の道を、村の神社まで祈願こめに駈足をつゞけたつてんですから、噓みたいな話ですよ。」\n英助「ほう山本にもそんな逸話があつたのかね」\n淸水「みんな熱心ですよ、さう云ふ班長殿だつて、音樂學校を途中で止めたさうぢやないですか」\n英助「うむ、だがこれは日本男兒の當然の義務だからな、立派な藝術家になるにしても軍人精神といふものは絕對必要だよ。」\n淸水「さうです、殊に吾々半島人がより良き日本人となるには軍隊生活に入つて立派な日本精神を體得することですよ。」\n列の中に先程から唯一人默々として憂鬱さうに行軍してゐる木下太郎。安本がそれを見て、\n「木下ツ」\nと呼ぶ。\n木下元氣のない聲で「うん」と答へたが再び默々として步く。\n英助がチラとそれを見咎める。\n安本「またふさぎ込んでゐるぞ」\n淸水「をかしいな、彼奴此の頃……」\nその時行軍は目的の場所に着く。\n\n2

野營陣地\n\n旣に出來上つてゐる。\n附近の民家から、婦人達がソバや餅や玉子を持つて來て、\n「これ上つて下さい」\n志願兵達辭退する。\n婦人達\n「いえこれ食べて吳れなければかへりません」\n野原へ坐り込む。\n仕方なく受取る。\n婦人達、嬉しさうに歸つて行く。\n\n4 附近の民家\n\n板飛びに興ずる生徒。\n肥大漢の山本尻餅をつく。\n民家の娘達も笑ひ轉げる。\n\n5

墓地\n\n福順と木下太郞がやつて來る。\n土を盛り上げたばかりの小さい墓。\n新しい墓標に「木下一夫之墓」と書かれてある。\n福順は持つて來た草花を供へ、新しい水を注ぎ墓前に團子を供へる。\n木下はぢつと墓を見て居たが、次第に頭をたれる。やがてそこへ踞み土をなでながら墓に向つて、\n「一夫淋しかつたらうな、父さんの留守にこんな姿になつちまつて……」\n「すみません」\nと福順はたまらなくなつて、\n「あなたのお留守に坊やを死なしてしまつて。私どんなにお詫びしていいか判りません」\n木下。だまつて土をいぢつて居る。\n福順、墓の前に手をつき\n「一夫やお父さんがお前に逢ひに歸つていらしたよ。ほら立派な兵隊さんになつてね。お前お父さすのお姿をよく見ておくんですよ」\n泣き崩れる。\n木下靜かに妻をいたはる。\n「泣くな。壽命だもの、仕方がない。＜63＞この子が不仕合せな星の下に生れたんだよ」\n福順「でも一度で良いからあなたのこの立派なお姿を坊やに見せてやり度かつたわ。きつと坊やは笑つて失敬をして見せたでせうに」\n墓の彼方に夕日が落ちる。\n\n44 扶餘の町\n\nF.I 曉の空\n「わツしよい〱」\nと元氣な靑年たちの聲\nキヤメラ、パンダウンするとまだ明けやらぬ扶餘の町を、英助、木下を先頭とする中堅靑年たちか農具を肩に勇ましく馳足行軍をして行く。\n\n45

英助の家の庭\n\n掛聲が聞える。\n宮城方位と書かれた木標の前にしつらへた遙拜壇で、東を拜む。英助の老父母遙拜を終り、父が聲の方を見ながら、\n「英助の奴ゆつくり體を休めれば良いのに」\n母「ほんとに元氣な子ですよ」\n\n48 久保良平の家\n\n良平夫妻に報告をして居るオモニの明淑。\n「あのね奥さま、昨日扶餘出身の兵隊が二人歸つて來ましてね、土地の靑年たちと早起會を作つたんださうです」\n良平「早起會？」\n明淑「えゝそれでね、今大勢で鍬を持つてね、畑を作りに行つたさうです。」\n\n49 白馬江岸の休閑地\n\n掘られて行く土。\n高く振られる鍬。\n國民歌謠「朝」の唄がコーラスで唄はれる。英助が鍬をふりながら唱導して居る。靑年たちの汗にまみれた顔、顔、顔\n\n50 附近の道\n\n農具をかついだ久保良平がやつて來る。旣に作物の出來て居る畑。良平は、立止つて靑年たちの方を眺めて居たが、やがて畑へ入り作物を調べ始める。\n英助と木下が作物の出來具合を見に來る。良平を見て一禮する。\n「こゝはお宅の畑ですか」＜64＞\n良平「いや別に儂の畑といふ事もないが河が段々埋まつてこの邊がずーつと空地になつたものだから、手なぐさみに少し作つて見たんですがね」\n英助、作物を見て\n「さうですか、よく出來てゐますね」\n良平「あんた方は兵隊さんですね」\n英助と木下\n「はツ、さうであります」\n良平「扶餘出身の兵隊さんが二人歸つたといふ事を聞きましたが、あんた方の事でしたか」\n英助「はツ、賜暇歸鄕を頂いて故鄕へ別れを告げに歸りました」\n良平「では愈々戰地へ行かれるんですか」\n二人「はい」\n良平「御苦勞さんですね。一つしつかりお願ひしますよ」\n英助「は、半島人として吾々がお國の爲に御奉公出來ることを心から光榮に思つて居ります」\n良平「いや儂等こそ感謝しなけりやなりません。あとで博物館へ一つ立寄つて下さい。儂はあすこへ出て居りますから」\n英助「有難うございます」\nと言ひ皆の働いて居る方へ行きかけながら、開墾してゐる方を指し、\n「一つあすこも何か作物に使つて下さい。皆で開墾しておきますから」\n良平「おや〱さうですか」\n英助「芋なら出來ると思ふんですが…」\n良平「芋なら良いでせう」\n英助「食糧增産とまでは行かないでせうが、土に親しむといふことが肝腎なことですので、實は昨日歸りまして村中を一通り見て廻り、靑年たちと計らつて、休閑地を全部開墾することにきめました。それで早速今朝から實行して居るところです。」\n良平感心する。\n「さうとなりや、儂も一つ仲間入りさせて貰はう」\n農具をかついで英助達のあとへ隨ふ\n\n51 久保良平の家\n\n廊下外、やつて來た房子。部屋の中に向つて\n「美ツチヤン起きた？」\n部屋の中から美津枝の聲。\n「えゝさつきから」\n障子を開けて顔を出す美津枝。\n美津枝の後から顔を出す李白姬。\n白姬は房子に、\n「お早うございます」\n房子それを受けてから、\n「よくおやすみになれましたか？」\n白姬「ええ。ほんとに突然參りまして御迷惑をおかけします。」\n房子「いえ、田舍の事ですから何もお構ひ出來ませんけれど、氣樂になすつて下さいね」\n白姬「ありがたうございます」\n美津枝あたりの調度を見て房子に、\n「お姉さまの所、何から何迄朝鮮式ね」\n房子笑ひながら\n「うちの人の趣味よ。漬物でもうちではキムチでないといけないんですから」\n美津枝「まあさう」\nと云ひ\n「お義兄さんは！」\n房子「野良へ行つたわよ」\n美津枝「野良へ？でもお義兄さんは博物＜65＞館の館長さんでせう」\n房子、うなづき、\n「それでも朝一度は野良へ出ないと氣持が惡いんですつて……田舍育ちですからね」\n美津枝「まあ義兄らしいわ」\n房子「それでも貴女方が來て吳れたのでとても嬉しいらしいの、今日は自分で扶餘案內をするつて言つてたわ」\n\n52 江岸近くの道\n\n農具を肩に引上ぐる靑年たち。\n良平が英助に云ふ。\n「今日は一つあんたに是非賴み度いことがあるんだが」\n英助「はア何ですか」\n良平「親戚の者に此の百濟の都扶餘の內鮮一體の事蹟を見せてやり度いんですが仕事の暇で良いですから、あんた一つ引受けてくれませんか」\n英助「開墾ならいくらでも引受けますが土地案内はどうも……」\n\n53

附近の道\n\n博物館の小使と共に、英助がやつて來る。\n\n56 元の場所\n\n良平が、\n「あれだ。あの男だよ」\n房子「まあ、兵隊さんですか」\n良平「うん、金子英助と云つてな、立派な靑年だ」\nそこへ英助、近寄つてくる。\n良平が房子を紹介する。\n「金子さん、これが家内です」\n英助、房子に敬禮して、\n「金子英助であります」\n良平、館内に向つて、\n「おーい美津ちやん」\n館内から美津枝の聲。\n「はーい」\n良平、「こつちへ出ておいで」\n美津枝と白姬が出て來る。\n金子英助が二人を見る。\n意外な邂逅に驚く美津枝、\n「あら金子さん」\n英助も「浅野さんでしたか」\n美津枝「その節はどうも」\n英助「いえこちらこそ」\n啞然として見守る良平夫妻、\n美津枝、英助をしげ〱と見ながら\n「いよ〱入營されましたのね」\n英助「え、近く出征しますので賜暇歸鄕を許され、昨日兩親の許へいとま乞ひに歸りました」\n美津枝「まあ御鄕里は扶餘でしたの、それは御目出度うごさいますわ」\n英助禮を受ける。\n良平が、英助に、\n「今更紹介するのも可笑しいことになつてしまつたが、金子さん、これは家内の妹なんです」\nと美津枝を引き合はせる。\n英助「さうでしたか。實は京城で偶然お知合になりました」\n良平「さうですか。此の節の若い人たちは……いや、その何ですよ」\nハツハツと豪■に笑ふ。\n英助、美津枝に、＜67＞\n「お兄さんからは、その後、何かお便りがありましたか」\n美津枝、先刻の手紙を出し、\n「え、今日手紙が……」\n房子が、\n「何て書いてあつたの？」\n美津枝「とても元氣らしいのよ」\n良平「まあ讀んで見て來れ」\n美津枝「私が？いやだわ」\n良平「何がいやなものか、日頃に似合はんことを云ふ。どれ、儂が一つ讀んでやらう」\nと、美津枝から手紙を受取つて讀み始める。\n「今○○へ着いた。あなたも扶餘の姉のところへ行つてゐる頃だと思ふ。扶餘はみんな元氣か。博物館長の兄貴は、相變らず內鮮一體を論じてゐることだらう事實今度の出征で僕も半島を再認識した現在內地に住んでゐる人達は半島に對して、もつと理解の眼を持たなければいけない。我々の先祖は旣に千三百年前、扶餘を中心として內鮮一體の實をあげてゐるのだ、それは、歷史の上によくあらはれてゐる。此の邊のことは博物館長の兄貴が得意な處だらうから省くとして…」\n良平讀みながら頣をしごく。\n美津枝、房子、笑ふ。\n良平つゞけて讀む。\n「現地でも半島の兄弟は、聖戰の任務をよく遂行して吳れてゐる。吾々が出征の途中、半島の驛といふ驛での、歡送や白衣の婦人たちの熱誠をこめて振つて吳れたあの旗の波を思ひ出す度に、われ〱兵隊は、命も惜まない氣持になる。」\nぢつと聞いてゐる英助。\n良平の讀む聲は更につゞく。\n「殊に京城驛で、我々にお守りを分けてくれながら、兵隊さん賴みます、御苦勞さまです、有難う〱と云つて步いてゐた一人の氣高い靑年の姿が、僕には何故だか忘れられない」\n美津枝、ふと顔をあげて、英助を見守る。\n英助はぢつと聞いてゐる。\n良平は更につゞけて讀む。\n「僕はその靑年の姿をぢつと見、その誠意の溢れた言葉を聞き、その眞劍な顔を見た時、感激のあまり十圓札を紙につゝんで何かの役に立ててくれるやう、その靑年に渡した」\n英助次第に感動を覺える。\n良平の聲は熱を帶びて來る。\n「僅か十圓の金でその靑年の心を買はうと思つたのではない。心からの本當に誠心からの感謝の意の一端を、あの靑年に知らしたい一心だつた。俺は一生懸命に鬪ふ。あの半島靑年の爲に、明日敵彈に當つて倒れてもにつこり笑つて死ねると思つてゐる。そんな、氣持にさへなつてゐる。」\n英助の眼に淚が浮ぶ。\n彼はそれを見られまいとして、その場を離れる。\nみんなが英助の方を見る。\n美津枝「お兄さまのお手紙の靑靑と云ふのはあの方なの」\n「えつ」\n良平夫妻、驚く。\n美津枝「京城驛で、お兄さまたちに、お守りを上げて下さつたのはあの方なの。まだ兵隊さんになる前でしたわ、ねえ白＜68＞姬さん」\n白姫「さうですわ。こんな處でお逢ひするなんで不思議なものね。」\n良平夫妻の顔に感動の色が浮ぶ。\nWP\n\n57 泗泚樓への道\n\n美津枝と白姬を案內して來る英助。\n絃樂の音がする。\n見上れば、泗泚樓の上に、若い女性が四、五人凉をいれながら琴や長鼓を持出して風流な古歌を唄つてゐる三人立止つて暫く聞く。\n美津枝、英助に聞く。\n「何の唄ですの」\n英助「あれは春香傳の中の廣寒樓の一節です。朝鮮の長唄ツてとこですね」\n\n58 久保家の緣側\n\n房子が\n「あの金子さんが、こちらの方ですの」\n良平「さうだよ」\n房子「でも苗字が違ふぢやありませんか。」\n良平「何を云つてゐるんだ、今時朝鮮に昔風の金さんとか、朴さんとかいふ名前があるかい」\n房子「あゝ創氏をしたんですね」\n良平「さうだよ。大體お前は半島へ來て彼是もう五年にもなるのに、今頃そんな事でどうするんだい」\n房子「すみません」\n良平「而しいい靑年だらう」\n房子「いゝ方ね」\n良平「美津枝も、あれで滿更でもなささうぢやないか」\n房子「大體あの子は、分け隔ての全然ない子ですから……」\n良平「素直だな。だから顔が明るい」\n房子「でも、籍や何かの事がありますから田舎の叔父が、どう云ひますか」\n良平「反對があつたら儂が說く。先刻の手紙ぢやないが、内地人がもう少し溫い手を差しのベなくちやいかん」\n房子「朝鮮の本當の良さツてものを、內地の人たちは、本當に知る機會が少いんですよ。ですから田舍になればなる程、籍や何かの事が問題になりますわ」\n良平「だから、朝鮮に理解のある我々が先づ實踐して、さういふ舊弊をなくして行かなくちあ、何時まで經つたつて內鮮一體は掛聲に終つちまふんだ。理窟を云ふ前に先づ實行だ。儂は戶籍法が改正されゝば、原籍を忠淸南道にうつす積りだお前もしつかり腹をきめておけ」\n房子「はい〱」\n良平「處でお前、扶餘神宮の御祭神はどなた樣か知つてゐるか」\n房子「えゝ知つてゐますとも。」\n良平「ぢや聞かう」\n房子「應仁天皇、齊明天皇、天智天皇、神功皇后の四祭神でせう」\n良平、滿走して、\n「偉い、流石は儂の家内だけの事はある。だが御祭神が特に扶餘にお祭りされるのはどういふ譯だ。」\n房子笑つて、\n「まあ子供の試驗ぢやあるまいし、それこそ日頃あなたが云つてゐらつしやる內鮮一體の一語で盡きるぢやありませんか。」\n良平、豪快に笑ふ。そして、＜69＞\n「處でね、內鮮結婚は優生學的に非常にいいらしいね。厚生省でも、總力聯盟でも、特に内鮮結婚を獎勵してゐるつて話だぜ」\n房子「まあ本當ですか」\n良平「うん、統計の上で現はれてゐるさうだ。いゝ子供が然も澤山出來るといふんだがら、こんないい話はないよ。」\n房子「今流行の三ツ兒でも出來るんですか。」\n良乎「三ツ兒はどうだか分らないが……\n今わが國としては此の人口問題は重大だからな。二十三にもなつて、美津枝なんかぶらぶら遊んでゐてはいかんよ」\n房子「それで、あなた、あの金子さんの意中は聞いたんですか」\n良平「おつと、それを聞くのを忘れてゐただがそれは儂が責任を持つて引受けるからお前は美津枝の方を一つ口說いてくれ」\n房子「おや〱骨の折れる仲人ですこと」\n二人笑ふ。\n\n59 白馬江\n\n船を流す英助と美津枝と白姬。\n船頭が、哀調を帶びた歌を唄つてゐる。\n遠ざかり行く落花巖、百花亭\n英助が說明してゐる。\n「あの岩が有名な落花巖です。百濟の宮女三千人が唐や新羅の軍門に降るを潔とせず、この白馬江に身を投じてあたら花と散つたといふ史蹟です」\n聞いてゐる美津枝と白姬。\n流れる水。\n船頭の歌。\n英助「いま船頭が無心に歌つてゐる歌が落花三千の民謠ですよ。哀れな當時の姿が偲ばれるでせう」\n美津枝、ぢつと唄を聞いてゐたが、\n「鮮の歌は、一體に哀調を帶びてゐますわね。」\n英助「そんな事はありませんよ。そりやアリランとかトラヂとか、內地で云へば佐渡おけさの樣な哀調を帶びたのが、口につき易い關係で、みんなに親しまれてはゐるんですが、朝鮮の古い唄は絕體に非常に明るいんですよ。例へば陽山道、こちらの言葉でヤンサンドと云ひますがさういふ民謠はシンフオニーにもなつて居ますし、立派なメロデイです。」\n美津枝「一つ聞かしてくださらない？」\n英助「困るなあ、自分はあまり得意ではないんですが」\nと船頭に歌つてくれと賴む。\n船頭朝鮮語で「あんたが唄ふといゝよ」と應じない。\n美津枝「ずるいわ、金子さん」と、なじる。\n英助「では折角ですから、眞似ごとで一つ歌ひませうか」\n英助は「陽山道」を歌ふ。\n船歌、船の中から長鼓を持出し、之を背中にかけてジヨツター〱と合ひの手を入れる。\n其の樣子が如何にも面白いので、美津枝と白姬も、つられて合ひ手を入れる。\n英助の歌を乘せて、船は白馬長江を下つて行く。

These are the magazine \"Kugŏ Pogŭp\" (「國語普及」 - National Language Promotion), \"Munye\" (「文藝」 - Literature and Arts), and \"Adong Chapchi\" (「兒童雜誌」 - Children's Magazine), all said to be Korean-language magazines (朝鮮文雜誌).\n\n**Deployment of the Second Broadcasting Department**\n\nWho is in the Second Broadcasting Department, managing the broadcast programs? Let's look at the members:\nProgram Formation\nSecond Broadcasting Department Head: No Ch'angsŏng (盧昌成)\nActing Head (代理): Yi Hyegu\nLectures, Courses Section: Kim Ŏk\nYi Chŏngsŏp\nKim Tongik\nMo Yunsuk\nPerforming Arts, Music Section: Yi Sŏgu\nHong Nanp'a\nKim Chŏngsil\nNam Yŏnjun <79> Im Tonghyŏk\nKim **\nChildren's Section: Yang *hyŏn\nAnd the announcers are as follows:\nBroadcasting Section Chief (放送係主任): Yi Kyewŏn\nSong Chin'gŭn\nYi Hyŏn\nKu Ponmyŏng\nYi Iknyŏng\nPak Nansin\nSŏ Chŏngman\nSon Chŏngbong\nYi Wŏn'gu Toyohara Nobukatsu Ōmura Shinjō\nKim *kil\nHŏ *ok\nYi Sangok\n\n**How much is the fee for one broadcast?**\n\nHow much does the broadcasting station pay gentlemen who broadcast daily for 20 to 30 minutes? Let's investigate the differences for lectures, broadcast novel dramas, children's programs, music, traditional opera (ch'anggŭk), etc.:\nLecture: 7 Wŏn (단, However, when it's a high official, giving money is considered discourteous (失禮), so fruit worth about 15 Wŏn is presented (呈))\nNarrative Story (야담): 7 Wŏn (However, 10 Wŏn for Mr. Sin Chŏngŏn)\nChildren's Story (동화): 7 Wŏn\nCommon Knowledge Lecture (常識講座): 7 Wŏn\nNovel Reading (소설朗讀): 7 Wŏn\nSolo Vocal Music (음악독창): 7 Wŏn (However, sometimes 15 Wŏn to 20 Wŏn depending on the person)\nChoir (합창단) (Per Person - 每人): 7 Wŏn (30 Wŏn to 40 Wŏn for the group)\nTraditional Opera (창극)*: 7 Wŏn (However, 10 Wŏn for mid-level performers, 20 Wŏn for Mr. Yi Tongbaek)\nBroadcast Drama (방송극) (Per Person - 每人): 7 Wŏn.\nFurthermore, the manuscript fees for broadcast novels and broadcast dramas are as follows: Broadcast novel 1 sheet (400-character manuscript paper - 400字詰): 80 Chŏn, broadcast drama manuscript fee is the same.\n\n**Ch'ŏndogyo Information**\n\n**Translating the Ch'ŏndogyo Scripture \"Tonggyŏng Taejŏn\"**\n\nThe Ch'ŏndogyo scripture \"Tonggyŏng Taejŏn\" (東經大全) was authored by Great Divine Teacher Suun (水雲 大神師). As it was in pure classical Chinese (純漢文), it caused much inconvenience for general believers (一船 敎徒). This time, Ch'ŏndogyo leader (敎領) Mr. Yi Chongnin, Mr. Yi Tonhwa, and 2-3 others have already begun translation, which is ongoing. The translation is reportedly being done into two versions: pure Korean (純朝鮮文) and the national language (國語 - Japanese).\n\n**Over Two Hundred Propagation Centers**\n\nThe number of religious workers (敎役者) scheduled to gather for the training session (講習會) intended to be held this time was expected to be over 200, even if only one person came from each of the 200-plus propagation centers (布敎所) within Korea.\n\n**Mr. Hyŏn Chemyŏng Tasked with Composing \"Ch'ŏndŏk Song\"**\n\n- Content also being revised -\nThe \"Ch'ŏndŏk Song\" (天德頌), which can be called the hymn (讚頌歌) of Ch'ŏndogyo, had some points in its content unsuitable for the current situation (時局). Therefore, these parts are being revised, and simultaneously, the melody (曲調) was also not common. Thus, musician Mr. Hyŏn Chemyŏng, a professor at Yŏnhŭi College (延專), <80> has been commissioned to compose it solemnly (崇嚴) and lively (活潑), it is said.\n\n**Mr. Cho Kigan Currently Visiting Manchurian Churches**\n\nTemporary Return to Keijō\nMr. Cho Kigan, head of edification (敎化觀長) at the Ch'ŏndogyo Headquarters, departed Keijō in late May, inspected churches in various parts of Manchuria, and returned to Keijō on July 25th after about two months to attend the Chihil Memorial Ceremony (地日記念式).\n\n**Personnel News**\n\nLeader (敎領) Mr. Yi Chongnin frequently visits Ui-dong (牛耳洞), a scenic spot outside the city, for the translation of \"Tonggyŏng Taejŏn.\"\nMr. Yi Tonhwa is staying in Ui-dong for the same translation work.\nMr. Ch'oe Rin, after resigning as president of Maeil Sinbo, is said to be spending his days reading at home.\nMr. Kwŏn Tongjin recently went to Changhowŏn, where his children reside, and seems likely to spend the summer there.\nMr. O Sech'ang suffered from a leg ailment for some time and was in distress, but is said to have some improvement (差度) now.\n\n**Literati Association Information**\n\n**Labor Service at Gokoku Shrine**\n\n**Forty-Six Korean and Japanese Writers Mobilized**\n\nPreviously, the Literati Association members performed labor service at the Puyŏ Shrine (扶餘 神宮) construction site (御造營地) and returned. Then again, on July 7th, the 4th anniversary of the Holy War (聖戰), nearly 50 Korean and Japanese literary figures mobilized for labor service (勤勞봉사) at the construction site of the Gokoku Shrine (護國神社) in Yongsan. Amidst a harmonious atmosphere (和氣), they completed two hours of service (奉役) from 9 AM to 12 PM.

They are said to have already contributed significantly to social work, starting with the business world (實業界). They readily contributed (快擲) 30,000 Wŏn as the first round for the Hyŏndae Theater and have decided to provide active support going forward.\n\n**Hyŏndae Theater's 2nd Performance**\n\nOn September 21st, 22nd, and 23rd at the Pumin'gwan (府民館), they will reportedly stage \"Nakhwaam\" (落花岩), a dramatization of late Paekche history in 4 acts and 6 scenes, as their second performance.

Truly, the 23 million Annamese people are now under the military protection of the Empire and have attained peaceful lives and livelihoods. As this much has laid the cornerstone for the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, we cannot but offer our congratulations.\n\nHowever, the hostile nations Britain and America are increasingly showing their poisonous fangs, attempting to obstruct our construction of East Asia by freezing the Empire's assets in Britain and America, which is truly infuriating. Now, we, the 100 million people, must solely rely on磨ing our own strength to repel this hostility and stride forward.\n\nGentlemen, I believe you heard several days ago the resolution demanded of the people regarding the wartime lifestyle system from Director-General Kawagishi of the National Total Strength League (總力聯盟). Truly, as he said, at this juncture, we earnestly hope that a minimum and simplest lifestyle, no different from that of the officers and soldiers on the front lines, will be established, so that there is no disruption to the posture of national general mobilization.<93>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis editorial celebrates Japan's military advance into French Indochina as a step towards the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and condemns Britain and America for freezing Japanese assets. It strongly urges the populace (implicitly including Koreans as part of the Empire's \"100 million people\") to adopt an austere \"wartime lifestyle,\" echoing a call by Director-General Kawagishi of the National Total Strength League, equating civilian life with that of soldiers at the front to support the national mobilization. For historians, this piece is revealing as it clearly shows the propaganda disseminated in colonial Korea during the height of Japan's expansionism. It demonstrates the attempt to integrate Koreans into the Japanese imperial narrative, justify aggression, demonize Allied powers, and enforce wartime austerity and mobilization upon the colonial subjects.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n皇軍\t황군\tImperial Army\n佛印\t불인\tPulin (French Indochina)\n安南\t안남\tAnnam (Annamese)\n帝國\t제국\tCheguk (Empire [of Japan])\n英\t영\tYŏng (Britain)\n米\t미\tMi (America)\n總力聯盟\t총력연맹\tCh'ongnyŏk Yŏnmaeng (National Total Strength League)\n川岸總長\t천안총장\tKawagishi Sōchō (Director-General Kawagishi)\n大東亞共榮圈\t대동아공영권\tTaedong'a Kongyŏnggwŏn (Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere)\n\n**Glossary**\n\n臨戰生活\t임전생활\tWartime lifestyle\n共同防衛\t공동방위\tJoint defense\n約定\t약정\tAgreement, pact\n進駐\t진주\tStationing troops, advance into\n赤道下\t적도하\tBelow the equator\n實로\t실로\tTruly, indeed (Older spelling of 실로)\n安住樂業\t안주낙업\tLiving peacefully and enjoying one's work\n柱礎\t주초\tFoundation stone, cornerstone\n慶賀\t경하\tCongratulate, celebrate\n마지안노라\t마지않노라\tCannot but...

Activities Centered Around Over 1,000 Kyōwakai Branches\n\nThe movement to turn Koreans residing in mainland Japan (Naichi) into Imperial subjects (황국신민화 운동) is being carried out through the Kyōwa project (協和 사업 - Harmony Project). The 1.2 million resident Koreans are, in principle, members of the Kyōwakai (協和會 - Harmony Association). All these Kyōwakai members are enveloped within the organizational discipline of the Kyōwakai, becoming a strong unified body under the same national spirit and same pace, continuing the reliable steps toward becoming Imperial subjects.\n\nAt the center, under the close contact and guidance of ministries such as Welfare (厚生省), Home Affairs (內務省), Education (文部省), and Colonial Affairs (拓務省), the incorporated foundation Central Kyōwakai (中央協和會) handles the liaison and coordination of the local Kyōwakai branches throughout the country. Locally, 46 Prefectural Kyōwakai (道府縣 協和會), with Prefectural Governors as chairmen, have established a network of approximately 1,050 branches, with police chiefs as branch heads, managing the protection and guidance of members. Among the members, those with deep trust serve as assistant guidance counselors (補지도원), assisting the association's executives and managing contact between the association and its members. These counselors are honorary positions, and their current number<94> is about 11,000. This is the broad outline of the Kyōwakai's structure. The pledge made at the National Kyōwa Project Conference held in Tōkyō in February of Shōwa 15 (1940) to celebrate the 2,600th year of the Empire vividly expressed the path the Kyōwa project is taking.\n\nPledge\nOne. We pledge to become loyal Japanese subjects, upholding the sacred will of universal benevolence (一視同仁).\nOne. We pledge to serve in our respective workplaces, following the true meaning of practicing the way of the subject (臣道實踐).\nOne. We pledge to cultivate and improve our lives, embracing the spirit of assimilation into the mainland (內地同化).\n\nThe movement for Naichi-Chōsen Ittai (內鮮一體化 - Mainland Japan-Korea unification) among resident Koreans, which is currently surging across the country from Hokkaidō to Kagoshima, is nothing but the fruit of the practice of this pledge by Kyōwa leaders and general members. It goes without saying that this pledge ultimately aligns with the spirit of the \"Pledge of the Imperial Subject (皇國臣民의 誓詞).\"\n\nNational Defense Donations and Aircraft Contributions\n\nFurthermore, regarding the resident Koreans' understanding of the current situation:\nOne. Regarding the National Defense Donation (國防獻金) movement, since the outbreak of the Incident [Second Sino-Japanese War], the voluntary defense donations by Kyōwakai members and contributions for comforting dispatched soldiers and their bereaved families have reached extraordinary amounts. Particularly, when the Central Kyōwakai, responding to the earnest requests of members, proposed a fundraising drive for arms contributions celebrating the 2,600th year of the Empire in consultation with the Prefectural Kyōwakai in July of Shōwa 15 (1940), their devotion reached its peak. In the short period of about two months from July 22 to September 30, Shōwa 15, the pledged amount reached 530,000 Yen, and the participants included almost all resident Koreans.\nThis fund included large contributions from several individuals who had diligently saved for many years since migrating to the mainland. For example, the number of contributors donating 100 Yen or more alone was 467 (totaling 89,000 Yen). On the other hand, a large portion also consisted of small amounts accumulated through the day-and-night toil and sweat of individuals.\nThus, on May 4th and 5th last, naming ceremonies for the contributed Navy and Army aircraft were grandly held at Tōkyō's Haneda airfield, attended by nearly 2,000 Kyōwakai members from all over the country.\nTwo. Home front activities (銃後活動), including visiting wounded soldiers and providing labor service for bereaved families, are thoroughly spread among members across all fields.\n\nHeightened Reverence for Shintō Deities\n\nShintō shrine worship also shows how diligently resident Koreans are striving to become Imperial subjects. The enshrinement of household Shintō altars (神棚) in each home, pilgrimages to shrines (神氏), and volunteer shrine cleaning are widely practiced by individuals. Among them are not a few philanthropists (篤志家) who undertake nationwide bicycle pilgrimages<95> to pray for the continued fortune of the Imperial Army in battle, or who donate funds for shrine construction and sacred trees (神木). Particularly, group shrine visits organized by Kyōwakai branches or sub-branches, and group pilgrimages to places like the Ise Grand Shrine (皇大神宮), Kashihara Shrine (橿原神宮), and Meiji Shrine (明治神宮) organized by Prefectural Kyōwakai, always have numerous participants.\n\nMany Also Adopt New Names\n\nThe opening of the path for name creation and change (創氏改名 - Sōshi-kaimei) also made a great impression among Koreans residing in mainland Japan. Even today, after the deadline for notification has passed, the demand for name creation and change is very high.\nHowever, those residing in the mainland face inconveniences regarding consultations with legal domicile registrars (視寂綠者 - *likely a typo for 戸籍吏 etc.*) and communication with their place of origin (本籍地). Moreover, many are family members of household heads residing in Korea (在鮮戶主), so their name creation and change depend on the results in Korea. On the other hand, since using mainland-style names (內地式氏名) is quite necessary for integrating and assimilating into mainland life, it is expected that they will undergo name creation and change in the near future.\n\nHow Has Life Improved?\n\nFinally, looking at the state of the lifestyle improvement movement among resident Koreans:\nOne. Regarding the use of the national language (國語 - Japanese), roughly one-third speak it daily, one-third know some, and the remaining one-third are still non-speakers. Therefore, it is being diligently promoted through national language classes (國語講習會).\nTwo. Next is the actual state of clothing improvement. Men's clothing, except for a very small number of elderly people, has almost entirely become mainland style. Recently, the number of people wearing the national uniform (國民服) is also increasing. Mainland-style clothing for women is also gradually spreading, but compared to men, there is still a feeling of delay. However, Japanese sewing classes (和服裁縫 講習會) and wearing instruction classes (着附指導 講習會) are held in various places, and it is expected to spread much more gradually.\nFurthermore, during air raid drills (防空演習), the sight of Korean women actively participating wearing \"monpe\" (몬베 - women's work trousers) was very good.\n\nWhat About School Enrollment?\n\nCurrently, the school enrollment rate for Korean children (學童) in mainland Japan was 69% in the Shōwa 13 fiscal year (1938), and this rate has increased every year since. The number of enrolled children is now:\nShōwa 11 fiscal year (1936): 55,000\nShōwa 12 fiscal year (1937): 63,000\nShōwa 13 fiscal year (1938): 76,000\nShōwa 14 fiscal year (1939): 102,000\nreaching this large number.\nSurveying the above, the trend of Imperial subjectification among Koreans in mainland Japan becomes more and more remarkable along with the progress of the current situation. This can be said to be a manifestation not only of those residing in the mainland but of all 24 million Koreans taking strong steps toward Imperial subjectification.<96>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis 1941 article reports on the activities of the 1.2 million Koreans living in mainland Japan, emphasizing their assimilation efforts and contributions to the Japanese war effort under the guidance of the Kyōwakai (Harmony Association). It highlights their participation in patriotic donation drives (including funding aircraft), Shinto worship, adoption of the Japanese language and clothing, eagerness for the Sōshi-kaimei (name change) policy, and increasing school enrollment rates for children, portraying these as evidence of their successful transformation into loyal \"Imperial subjects\" (황국신민). The article functions as wartime propaganda, showcasing the supposed unity and loyalty of colonial subjects (Koreans) within the Japanese empire ('Naichi-Chōsen Ittai'). Historians would find the detailed description of the Kyōwakai's structure and methods, the specific statistics on donations and school enrollment, and the explicit framing of assimilation activities (language, dress, name changes, religion) as proof of loyalty particularly interesting, offering insights into the mechanisms and rhetoric of colonial assimilation policies during the late colonial period.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n內地\t내지\tNaichi (Mainland Japan)\n朝鮮人\t조선인\tKoreans (Chōsenjin)\n江戶學人\t강호학인\tEdogakuin (Author Name)\n協和會\t협화회\tKyōwakai (Harmony Association)\n厚生省\t후생성\tMinistry of Welfare (Kōseishō)\n內務省\t내무성\tMinistry of Home Affairs (Naimushō)\n文部省\t문부성\tMinistry of Education (Monbushō)\n拓務省\t척무성\tMinistry of Colonial Affairs (Takumushō)\n中央協和會\t중앙협화회\tCentral Kyōwakai\n道府縣\t도부현\tPrefectures (Dōfuken)\n道府縣 協和會\t도부현 협화회\tPrefectural Kyōwakai\n昭和\t소화\tShōwa Era\n東京\t동경\tTōkyō\n北海道\t북해도\tHokkaidō\n鹿兒島\t록아도\tKagoshima\n羽田飛行場\t하네다 비행장\tHaneda Airfield\n皇大神宮\t황대신궁\tIse Grand Shrine (Kōtai Jingū)\n橿原神宮\t橿原神宮\tKashihara Shrine (Kashihara Jingū)\n明治神宮\t명치신궁\tMeiji Shrine (Meiji Jingū)\n朝鮮\t조선\tKorea (Chōsen)\n\n**Glossary**\n\n在內地\t재내지\tResiding in mainland Japan (Naichi)\n戰時下\t전시하\tUnder wartime conditions\n活躍\t활약\tActivity, being active\n協和會\t협화회\tKyōwakai (Harmony Association, organization for Koreans in Japan)\n황국신민화\t황국신민화\tImperial subjectification; Process of making colonial subjects loyal citizens of the Japanese Empire\n內地同化\t내지 동화\tAssimilation into mainland Japan\n臣道實踐\t신도 실천\tPracticing the way of the [Imperial] subject\n職域奉公\t직역 봉공\tService/contribution through one's workplace (wartime mobilization term)\n國防獻金\t국방 헌금\tNational defense donation\n飛行機獻納\t비행기 헌납\tAircraft donation/contribution\n銃後\t총후\tHome front (lit.

The largest concentration lives near Kaohsiung Prefecture, where they long ago organized a mutual friendship group called the \"Southern Haedong Association\" (南部海東會) to help each other and strive for character improvement. Below, we print a valuable correspondence received from an executive of that association, but first, we extract the purpose and other details of the \"Southern Haedong Association\" from its regulations:\n\n\"This Association shall be called the Southern Haedong Association and shall be organized by residents of Kaohsiung Prefecture and Tainan Prefecture who hold their permanent domicile (本籍) in Korea.\"\n\"The purpose of this Association is to promote mutual friendship and welfare among members and to provide relief and assistance.\"\n\"The office of this Association shall be located at 5-10 Irifune-chō, Kaohsiung Prefecture.\"\n\nThe association divides its member areas into five districts:\nDistrict 1 (Kaohsiung City and Fengshan, Gangshan Counties)\nDistrict 2 (Pingtung City and nearby counties)\nDistrict 3 (Tainan City and Beimen, Xinying Counties)\nDistrict 4 (Chiayi City and nearby counties)\n\nAlso, in cases of marriage, funerals, illness, or hospitalization of members or their families, the following monetary gifts are presented.<97>\n1. Upon the death of a member: 5 Yen\n2. Upon the death of a member's family member: 3 Yen\n3. Upon the marriage of a member: 5 Yen\n4. Upon the marriage of a member's family member: 3 Yen\n5. Upon the hospitalization of a member or family member: 3 Yen\n6. Farewell gift (餞別): 3 Yen\n\nBased on this spirit and mutual aid, 700 members are united, fulfilling their public service (奉公) duties in wartime.\n\nSeven Hundred People in Kaohsiung Prefecture - Active After Organizing the Haedong Association -\n\nNow, we print verbatim a piece introducing the situation there, which arrived at our company (本社):\n\nGreetings omitted.\nWe constantly pray for the ever-increasing prosperity of your esteemed company.\nWe wish to briefly report on the local situation here.\n\nThe current season in Taiwan continues with scorching hot days every day. The harvest of the first rice crop has already finished, and it is now time for planting the second rice crop.\nThere are currently about 2,000 Peninsular people (半島人 - i.e., Koreans) in Taiwan, with 700 residing in Kaohsiung alone. Although we say 700 reside here, not all are heads of households; the majority are single individuals. There are about 50 or so heads of households.\nRegarding occupations, apart from 60 or 70 people engaged in commerce, the majority are involved in fishing.\nThe occupations of Peninsular people in Taiwan are thus quite simple. Whether in commerce or fishing, since they have all come from afar, they work with one mind, and their overall standard of living can be considered prosperous (祐福). Regarding fishing, it can be said that they are truly playing a significant role in the recent food policy.\nIt could almost be said that Peninsular people monopolize Taiwan's fishing industry, being active throughout the island. Among the Peninsular people, there are many outstanding captains and chief engineers.\nWe use the waters near the Philippines and Hainan Island as our working grounds, engaging day and night, without sleep or rest (晝夜 不眼不休), in catching marine resources. We return to port with ships full from a bountiful catch. A single fishing trip usually takes about 20 days from departure to return. Also, many Peninsular people work as crew on [illegible] ships<98> in the South China (南支那) region. While their husbands or sons are out at sea battling the raging waves (怒濤), their families remaining on land fully demonstrate their duties as citizens on the home front (銃後), especially the inherent character (適性) of Peninsular people.\nOriginally, seafarers, regardless of ethnicity, tend towards self-abandonment (自暴自棄), heavy drinking (暴飮), and exhibiting disgraceful behavior (醜態). In a bustling port like Kaohsiung, one frequently witnesses such disgraceful behavior among seafarers.\nThus, recognizing that this situation could not continue, the Peninsular Friendship Association (半島親睦會) in Kaohsiung was organized more than 10 years ago. At that time, only about 30 Peninsular people resided in Kaohsiung. Until the outbreak of the Incident (事變 - referring to the Second Sino-Japanese War), the association, true to its name \"Friendship Association,\" solely focused on the fellowship of Peninsular people. However, with the aim of controlling the disorderly conduct of the rapidly increasing number of Peninsular people year by year, and in response to the state of emergency, desiring that Peninsular people unite and contribute even slightly to the execution of the holy war (聖戰), the purpose of mere friendship was further strengthened immediately after the Incident began. Through the dedicated efforts of the chairman and various volunteers, they awakened those who, lulled by the hitherto prosperous fishing industry, had wasted money and acted disgracefully, causing them to reflect. Furthermore, with the voluntary awakening (覺醒) of Peninsular people, we now maintain our Association fully through our own strength.\nThe association hall is a two-story building accommodating resident Peninsular people, with a capacity for about 500 individuals.\nWe issue certificates to members to facilitate their return journeys by ship (歸船) or their travel to Taiwan (渡臺). We protect families while the head of the household is absent. For single members, a Members' Club (會員俱樂部) is established within the hall, equipped with dining and recreational facilities (娛樂機關).\nWe are sending a copy of the Association Rules (會則). (Omitted below)\n\nThe chairman of this association is Mr. Kim Yŏngt'aero (金永藤太郞氏) (former name Kim Ch'anho 金贊瑚氏), whom we wish to introduce.\nMr. Kim, whose permanent domicile is in scenic P'yŏngyang (平壤), came to Taiwan over 10 years ago and has truly devoted himself with selfless effort to the happiness of us Peninsular people. He has served continuously as chairman for 10 years, diligently striving to build the present, imperishable (不滅) Association.\nHis reputation (名望) is high not only among Peninsular people but also among Japanese and Taiwanese people (內臺人).\nThe over 2,000 compatriots in Taiwan sincerely revere Mr. Kim, considering him our great fortune and pride.\nHis meritorious service (功勞) will truly never be forgotten by the Peninsular people in Taiwan.<99>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis 1941 article from *Samch'ŏlli* magazine describes the situation of approximately 2,000 Koreans living in Taiwan, primarily concentrated in Kaohsiung Prefecture. Many are involved in fishing, playing a significant role in Taiwan's food supply, while others are in commerce. The article highlights the \"Southern Haedong Association,\" a mutual aid and P*ye*ngyang friendship society with 700 members in Kaohsiung, detailing its structure, services (financial aid for life events), and purpose. It emphasizes the association's shift from simple fellowship to promoting orderly conduct and contributing to Japan's war effort (\"holy war,\" \"wartime public service\") under the leadership of Chairman Kim Yŏngt'aero (formerly Kim Ch'anho), who is highly praised for his decade of service and revered by the Korean community.\n\nFor historians, this article is interesting as it shows the organization and community life of Koreans in a Japanese colony outside of Korea itself. It reveals the pressures and adaptations under wartime mobilization, including the adoption of Japanese names (Sōshi-kaimei), the rhetoric of loyalty to the empire (\"holy war,\" \"public service\"), and the efforts by community leaders to manage social behavior (discouraging drinking/disorder) while simultaneously organizing support for the war. The mention of fishing extending to the Philippines and South China highlights the geographic scope of Korean labor within the Japanese empire.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n臺灣\t대만\tTaiwan\n高雄州\t고웅주\tKaohsiung Prefecture\n臺南州\t대남주\tTainan Prefecture\n南部海東會\t남부해동회\tSouthern Haedong Association\n高雄市\t고웅시\tKaohsiung City\n鳳山郡\t봉산군\tFengshan County\n岡山郡\t강산군\tGangshan County\n屛東市\t병동시\tPingtung City\n臺南市\t대남시\tTainan City\n北門郡\t북문군\tBeimen County\n新營郡\t신영군\tXinying County\n嘉義市\t가의시\tChiayi City\n本社\t본사\tThis company (Samch'ŏlli)\n半島人\t반도인\tPeninsular people (Koreans)\n比律賓\t비율빈\tPhilippines\n海南島\t해남도\tHainan Island\n南支那\t남지나\tSouth China\n金永藤太郞\t김영등태랑\tKim Yŏngt'aero\n金贊瑚\t김찬호\tKim Ch'anho\n平壤\t평양\tP'yŏngyang\n內臺人\t내대인\tJapanese and Taiwanese people\n香川健二\t향천건이\tKagawa Kenji\n\n**Glossary**\n\n잇서\t있어\tBeing, existing (Older spelling of 있어)\n맛치고\t마치고\tFinishing (Older spelling of 마치고)\n함니다\t합니다\tDo/does (Older polite ending, now 합니다)\n世帶主\t세대주\tHead of household\n祐福\t유복\tProsperous, well-off\n半島人\t반도인\tPeninsular person (Referring to Koreans)\n거지반\t거의 반\tAlmost half, nearly half\n晝夜 不眼不休\t주야 불면불휴\tDay and night without sleep or rest\n銃後\t총후\tHome front (during wartime)\n적성\t적성\tInherent nature, aptitude, character\n각금\t가끔\tSometimes, occasionally (Older spelling of 가끔)\n其常時\t그 당시\tAt that time (Older form)\n왓는데\t왔는데\tCame, but...

He is Mr. Son Ch'angsik (孫昌植), who is currently renowned as the foremost figure in Shanghai's industrial world. This reporter visited Mr. Son's factory, known as the precision machine kingdom of the East, and now presents this account to the readers.\n\nShanghai is a city particularly developed in commerce and industry. Commercially, it serves as the gateway to the East and is a special zone famous as a competitive market for people from all over the world. In this international market, a single Korean is lauded by figures both domestic and foreign as the number one person in Shanghai's industrial world. Moreover, he has achieved great success in business, receiving considerable support even from the army and navy, thus radiating a unique brilliance in Shanghai. This person is the young industrialist, Mr. Son Ch'angsik.\n\nAs the president of the Shanghai Precision Machinery Works (上海精密機械工藝社), which proudly displays its magnificent appearance on a bustling street of Shanghai's North Sichuan Road (北四川路), Mr. Son has numerous foreign engineers and workers under his command. His office sees frequent visits from prominent domestic and foreign figures, making him a focus of public attention. Furthermore, the samples displayed in the storefront window alone make passersby stop in their tracks.\n\nMr. Son had already invented dozens of types of machines and obtained patents while studying in the Precision Machinery Department at the Government-established Tokyo Higher School of Technology and Art (官立東京高等工藝學校 精密機械科). Various newspapers and magazines reported extensively on his talent at the time. It is still fresh in people's memory that in the 5th year of Shōwa (1930), he received the Tokyo Prefectural Governor's Award, as well as commendations from the Imperial Invention Association (帝國發明協會) and the former Tong-A Ilbo (東亞日報社).<100>\n\nJust before reaching the North Sichuan Road bridge, as I opened the shop door of the imposing three-story Western-style building on the right, an Indian watchman gave a light nod. At that moment, Mr. Son, still in his work clothes, was instructing several Western engineers in fluent English. While waiting briefly, the reporter looked around. The interior was filled with lathes, and the office, with its many shelved books, felt like a library.\n\nSoon, Mr. Son greeted the reporter with a very gentle manner of speaking, and I began to ask professional questions.\n\nReporter: \"It's been quite a while since you came to Shanghai, hasn't it? Please tell us your success story, from when you first arrived until achieving your current great success.\"\n\nSon: \"I came to Shanghai (來滬) in the 7th year of Shōwa (1932), so it hasn't been that long. When I first arrived, I worked as a mere mechanic in a machine factory (機械工廠) run by Chinese,\" he replied. In reality, he was appointed as an engineer and factory manager at the Chinese machine factory and diligently engaged in practical research.\n\nReporter: \"When did you open this factory you are currently managing?\"\n\nSon: \"I opened it in March of the 11th year of Shōwa (1936).\"\n\nReporter: \"How much capital did you start with?\"\n\nIn response to the reporter's question, Mr. Son stated that he started with a small capital of only 5,000 yen. Initially, the business mainly involved repairing various precision machines. By the 13th year of Shōwa (1938), <101> it showed a figure of 80,000 yen, and currently, it demonstrates tremendous growth amounting to over 3 million yen. Additionally, besides office workers and Japanese ('Naichi-jin') workers, there are four German engineers and White Russian engineers, along with nearly 30 other Chinese and Indian workers.\n\nThe budget for this year is 1.5 million yen, consisting of 500,000 yen for machine tools and 1 million yen for various precision machines and other tools. Currently, 450,000 yen has been invested in factory facilities alone.\n\nNext, guided by Mr. Son, I decided to tour the laboratory and factory. The first thing that caught my eye was a microscope. It was a microscope equipped with an optical micrometer capable of measuring an error of 1/100,000th of an inch, said to be one of only two in Shanghai and worth 60,000 yen. Besides that, there were other microscopes and a balance scale capable of measuring 1/10,000th of a gram, among many other items lined up. Particularly, the precision measuring instruments Mr. Son uses for his own experiments are world-famous. First, there is a British-made Manchester vertical boring mill (currently valued at 80,000 yen, 9 horsepower motor diameter), a German-made tuner grinding spindle (which rotates 20,000 times per minute without generating heat), and an American-made planing machine (capacity <102> up to 8 shaku). The measuring tool section is equipped with 200,000 yen worth of instruments, including one set of Swedish-made Johansson gauge blocks (measuring errors of 1/100,000th of an inch), various German Leitz enlargers, highest-grade lamps, copy stands, and a German optical pyrometer (measuring temperatures from 700°C to 1,600°C) – all world-class items that amazed our eyes. In addition, various rare machines from countries including Switzerland, reportedly sold first in the East to Mr. Son Ch'angsik, were flawlessly arranged in each room on the 2nd and 3rd floors, truly boasting his status as a titan of Shanghai's industrial world, and then some.\n\nTop authorities from the commerce and industry sectors of Tokyo, Osaka, and other places in Japan ('Naichi'), as well as professors from various universities and specialty schools and other experts, come to Shanghai to visit and observe Mr. Son's factory, which possesses such unique machinery in the East.\n\nMr. Son not only has a hobby of collecting various jewels and minerals but also shows great interest in collecting old coins. His collection reportedly includes leaf coins (葉錢) from the Tang Dynasty (唐朝), paper money from the Qing Dynasty (淸朝), Japanese currency (日貨) from the 3rd year of Shōwa (1928) onwards,<103> silver and copper coins from various countries around the world, and other old currencies, totaling as many as 30,000 pieces.\n\nWhile guiding the reporter, Mr. Son said:\n\n\"In modern times, a nation's fate can be said to depend on the prosperity of its industry. I hope that our Korean youth will also pay attention to this field and make great contributions to society and the nation. However, it's a common mentality among us to dream of making a fortune overnight, which often leads to failure. Especially in a place like Shanghai, I believe one must adopt a continental business strategy.\n\nFor example, in the beer business, if Japanese ('Naichi-jin') or foreigners aim for a 10% profit on a cost price of 6 yen per dozen, Chinese people will sell at cost without even taking that 10% profit. You might ask what profit there is in selling at cost, but the common Chinese business strategy is to continue selling beer just because the empty boxes the beer came in are left over. In a special zone like Shanghai, where market competition is extremely fierce, I think one must employ such a continental business strategy, and I believe we Peninsula people (半島人) have much to learn from this point.\"\n\nMr. Son treats his workers very well, both materially and spiritually, and adopts ideal methods regarding hygiene and working hours, thereby further enhancing work efficiency.\n\n\"I don't treat the workers as mere workers, but as family or comrades working towards the same goal. Since there are people from various countries, I let them take days off on their respective national holidays, so the total number of holidays in a year adds up to 60 days. Nevertheless, work efficiency stems from how well the workers are treated,\" Mr. Son confesses from his experience.\n\nThe reporter jokingly asked:\n\n\"Now that you can be considered very successful, aren't you thinking of building a villa and dreaming of worldly pleasures? It's very rude of me to say, but it's what nouveau riche (成金) tend to do.\"\n\nAfter laughing, Mr. Son also laughed and replied:\n\n\"This factory is my villa now, and the machines spread out here are my entire entertainment (誤樂). Therefore, I don't think there's any need to build a separate villa, show off, or covet other forms of entertainment.\" His words gave the profound impression of a man who never loses the attitude of a Christian believer.\n\n\"In that case, aren't you planning to get involved in social work?\"\n\n\"Why not? That is my original intention. With assets still less than 5 million yen, I can't be considered hugely rich (成金). Rather than presumptuously seeking only honor, making noise about doing some social work, and showing nominal but meaningless results, I intend to embark on several <104> projects with a more solid foundation (基金) and substantial content. Since I am currently here in Shanghai, and especially under the banner of East Asian Co-Prosperity (東亞共榮), I plan to establish several churches, technical schools, and hospitals for the Chinese people. After accomplishing this work first on Chinese soil, I then intend to cooperate in meaningful projects in Korea (朝鮮) as well.\"\n\nMr. Son, who thus expresses his resolution, was formerly the council chairman of the Shanghai Korean Association (前上海朝鮮人會). After the Korean Association merged into the Japanese Residents' Association (日本民團), he is now active as the first chairman of its successor organization, the Kerim Club (鷄林俱樂部). Furthermore, as a central figure in the Shanghai Korean Christian community and a member (姜員 - likely 委員) of the Christian Alliance Refugee Relief Committee (基督敎聯盟難民救濟會), Mr. Son strives in various fields. We hold even greater expectations for his future.<105>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe article is an interview with Son Ch'angsik, a highly successful Korean industrialist in Shanghai in 1941. It highlights his journey from a talented inventor in his youth in Korea and Japan to becoming the president of the Shanghai Precision Machinery Works, a leading factory equipped with state-of-the-art machinery from around the world. Son discusses his business philosophy, emphasizing long-term strategies learned from Chinese merchants, his fair treatment of his multinational workforce, his simple lifestyle focused on his work, and his plans for future philanthropic projects like building churches, schools, and hospitals, first in China under the banner of \"East Asian Co-Prosperity\" and later in Korea. The article portrays Son as a model figure – a genius inventor, successful businessman, devout Christian, and active community leader.\n\nFrom the perspective of Korean colonial history, the article is interesting as it presents a narrative of Korean success and capability within the Japanese-dominated sphere of influence in Shanghai. It showcases a Korean collaborating seemingly comfortably with Japanese authorities (implied by army/navy support and the merger of the Korean association into the Japanese one) and operating within the ideology of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Son's comparison of business practices, contrasting Korean/Japanese methods with perceived \"continental\" Chinese strategies, and his plans to build institutions \"for the Chinese people\" first, offer insights into inter-ethnic dynamics and the complex positioning of Koreans in occupied China during this period.

처음 오셔서부터 지금의 大成을 보시기까지의 성공담을 우선 들려주십시오.」\n孫 「來滬하기는 昭和 7년도였으니까 오래지 못합니다마는, 처음 왔을 때에는 중국인경영인 機械工廠에서 일개 직공으로 종사했었지요」 하고, 대답하나, 실은 중국인 기계廠에서 기사겸 공장장으로 취임되여 실제 연구에 노력하였던 것이다.\n記者 「현재 경영하시는 이 공장은 언제부터 개업하셨습니까.」\n孫「昭和 11년 3월에 개업했습니다.」\n記者 「얼마나한 資本으로 시작하셨던가요?」\n記者의 물음에 孫씨는 최초 5천 圓이라는 적은 자본으로 시작했다한다. 처음엔 주로 각종 정밀기계수리였었는데 昭和 13년도에 이르러서는<101> 8만圓이라는 數字를 보여주었으며, 현재는 300여만圓이라는 엄청난 발전을 보여주고 있다. 그리고 사무원 內地人 직공외에도 獨逸人기사와 白系露人 기사가 4명 기타 中國人과 印度人만도 근 30여명이나 된다고 한다.\n그리고 금년도 예산은 150만圓 인바 공작기계가 50만圓, 각종 정밀기계와 기타 공구가 100만圓이라 하며, 현재 공장설비에만 45만圓을 드렸다한다.\n다음, 나는 孫씨의 안내로 실험실과 공장을 구경하기로 했다. 처음 눈에 걸리는 것이 顯微鏡이였는데, 그것은 1吋에 1/10만의 誤差를 측정하는 광학마이크로메-터가 附屬된 顯微鏡으로서 上海엔 둘도 없는 시가 6만圓 짜리라 한다. 그 외에도 顯微鏡이 있으며, 1 그람의 1/1만을 달을 수 있는 天秤 등, 모든 것이 즐비하게 놓여있다. 특히 孫씨 자신이 실험기구로 사용하는 정밀측정기들은 세계적으로 유명한바 爲先 영국제 맨체스타·바티칼·뽀링밀(현재시가 8만圓의 것으로, 9마력 모-타 직경)을 비롯하여 독일제 츄나·그라인딩·스핀돌(이것은 1분간 2만회를 회전해도 열이 발생치 않는 것이다.)와, 미국제 푸랜마신(캬파시리<102> 8척까지 깍음)과, 측정공구부에는 20만圓의 제기구가 정비되였는데, 瑞典製 요한소·뿌록케이지 1조(1吋의 1/10만의 誤差를 측정)와, 獨逸 라이쓰사 諸 확대기, 최고급 한등, 꼽피스댄드, 독일제 광학고온도계(700C도부터 1,600C도까지 계온) 등은 모두 세계 제일 우수한 것으로 우리의 눈을 놀래게 한다. 그 외에도 瑞西를 비롯하여 각국에서 동양에는 孫昌植씨에게 처음 放賣했다는 진귀한 각종 기계가 2층, 3층의 각 室에 빈틈없이 정비된 것은 실로 上海공업계의 雄을 자랑하고도 남음이 있었다.\n이와 같이 동양에서는 유일한 기계들을 가지고 있는 씨의 工廠에는 東京, 大阪 등지의 상공계의 일류 權威를 비롯하여 내지 각 대학, 전문교의 교수와 기타 전문가들이 上海에 와서 見學하고 간다고 한다.\n氏는 각종 寶石과 鑛物蒐集에도 취미를 가질뿐 아니라 古貨幣收集에도 매우 흥미를 가지는 모양이여서 唐朝시대의 葉錢을 비롯하여 淸朝시대의 紙幣 등, 그리고 昭和 3년부터의<103> 日貨, 세계각국의 銀貨와 銅貨, 또는 古貨 등 無慮 3만매에 달한다고 한다.\n氏는 기자를 안내하면서 하시는 말이,\n「현대에 있어선 국가의 운명은 공업의 陸盛如何에 좌우된다고도 할 수 있는데, 우리 조선청년들도 이 방면에 留意하여 사회와 국가에 공헌함이 크기를 要望합니다. 그런데, 우리는 一穫千金의 꿈을 가지기는 것이 보편된 심리이기 때문에 성공을 못보는 일이 많은데, 특히 上海같은 데서는 대륙적인 商業策을 가저야 할 것이라 봅니다.\n예컨대 맥주상을 경영하는데 있어서 內地人이나 외국인은 1打 원가 6원에서 1割의 이익을 취한다면 中國人은 그 1割도 이익보지 않고 원가대로 판매합니다.\n원가 그대로 팔면 무슨 이익이 있느냐 하겠지만 맥주병을 담았던 빈 상자가 남으니까 맥주판매를 그냥 계속한다는 것이 공통된 中國人의 상업정책인데, 上海와 같이 市場爭奪戰이 극심한 特殊지대에서는 이러한 대륙적인 商業策을 쓰지 않아서는 안될 것이다 생각하며, 우리 半島人도 이 점에서 배울 바가 크다고 생각합니다.」\n氏는 직공에게 대해서도 물질적으로나 정신적으로 매우 厚待하며 衛生, 시간에 있어서는 이상적인 방법을 취하고 있어서 일의 능률을 더욱 발휘하고 있다.\n「나는 직공을 직공으로 대하지 않고 가족으로, 또는 같은 일을 위한 동지로 생각하며, 각국인이 있으니만치 각기 제나라 祝祭日때에도 놀리여서 1년 중 휴일을 모두 합하면 60일이나 됩니다. 그래도 그만침 직공 待遇 여하에 일의 능률은 나는 것입니다.」 하고, 氏는 자기의 경험을 고백한다.\n기자는 농담삼아,\n「이제는 매우 성공했다고 볼 수 있는데 좀 별장도 지으시고 세상 樂도 꿈꾸시지 않으시렵니까. 매우 실례되는 말입니다마는 成金하는 이마다 그렇게 하니까 말입니다.」\n하고, 웃었더니, 씨 역시 웃으면서,\n「지금 이 공장이 내 별장이오, 여기 널려있는 기계가 내 誤樂의 전부로 대하니까 구태여 딴 별장을 짓고 거드러거리며, 딴 誤樂을 탐낼 것은 없다고 생각합니다.」하는 씨는 어디까지나 基督敎信者의 태도를 잃지 않는 감격을 준다.\n「그러시다면 사회사업 같은 것엔 손을 내여미시지 않으시렵니까.」\n「웨요, 본래의 내 뜻이 거기에 있으니까요. 지금은 500만원도 못되는 자산이니 크게 成金했다고도 볼 수 없으니까 주제넘게 名譽만을 탐내서 무슨 사회사업을 함네하고 떠들며 有名無實의 결과를 보이기보다는 좀더 튼튼한 基金으로 내용이 충실한 몇가지의<104> 사업에 착수하려합니다. 현재 上海에 와서 있느니만치, 더욱 東亞共榮이라는 旗帳 밑에서 中國人을 위해서 여러 교회당과, 공업학교와, 병원 등을 創建하려합니다. 중국땅에 먼저 이 일을 해놓고 다음 朝鮮에도 有意義한 사업에 협력하려합니다.」\n이렇게 결심을 披櫟하는 씨는 본래 上海에서 前上海朝鮮人會의 參事會議長으로 있다가 현재는 朝鮮人會가 日本民團에 합류되자 후계단체로 탄생된 鷄林俱樂部의 初代 理事長으로서 활약할뿐 아니라 上海朝鮮人 基督敎의 重鎭으로, 또는 基督敎聯盟難民救濟會姜員으로 다방면으로 노력하는 氏의 앞날에 우리는 더욱 큰 기대를 가지는 바이다.<105>\n<100-105>","magazine":"삼천리","date":"1941-09-01","title":"Record of Visiting Son Ch'ang-sik, Dominator of Three Million Won in Shanghai Financial Circles (President of Shanghai Precision Machinery Works, Shanghai's Number One Machine Kingdom)"},{"path":"86_13.09_1941.09/150.txt","issue":"86_13.09_1941.09","content":"Depending on the outcome of the German-Soviet War, the revival of the Romanov dynasty could also occur. There is a woman in New York dreaming that the former position of Grand Duchess will come to her. She is Grand Duchess Mari-. Habŭrobŭna, said to be the closest relative of the deposed Emperor Nicholas.\n\nShe has lived in New York for 15 years and now makes a living as a designer of women's clothing.\nAccording to an interview with an American newspaper reporter one day, she stated various impressions, premising them with, \"Führer Hitler will offer the throne to my nephew, Grand Duke Urajimi-r......\"\n\nIf the Romanov dynasty were to be revived, the 20-year-old Urajimi-r would be the rightful successor, and she also mentioned that because Urajimi-r is very intelligent and sound, he would never become Führer Hitler's robot.\nIn other words, while Russia being conquered by Germany is undesirable, the Soviet Union is just as detestable.\n\nK'erensŭk'i-, a major figure of the Russian Revolution, is also spending the rest of his life in New York, and he says the same thing as Grand Duchess Mari-.

It focuses on Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna (\"Mari-. Habŭrobŭna\"), a relative of Tsar Nicholas II, who anticipates a restoration of the Romanov monarchy under her nephew, Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich (\"Urajimi-r\"), should the Soviets fall. While opposed to a German takeover, she and other prominent exiles like Alexander Kerensky (\"K'erensŭk'i-\") and aviator Boris Sergievsky (\"Porissŭ. Seregŭbisŭk'i-\") express deep antipathy towards the Soviet regime, reflecting the complex political situation of the émigré community. For historians studying colonial Korea, this article is interesting as it shows Korean readership's exposure to international affairs, particularly the dynamics of WWII and anti-communist sentiments shared by Axis powers (including Japan, which controlled Korea). It reveals how global conflicts and ideological struggles were presented and consumed within the colonial context.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n帝政\t제정\tImperial rule (referring to Tsarist Russia)\n白系露人\t백계로인\tWhite Russian\n로마노프 왕조\t로마노프 왕조\tRomanov Dynasty\n마리 太后妃\t마리 태후비\tGrand Duchess Marie (likely Maria Pavlovna the Younger, referred to as Mari-.

Although he had drunk various kinds of wine, after drinking any of them, he would always end up searching, asking if there wasn't a better wine. When he heard the story of this Thousand-Day Wine, he rushed like an arrow to Chŏk Hŭi's house to obtain some. Chŏk Hŭi said, \"My wine is not yet sufficiently ready to drink.\"\n\nBeing a veritable demon for drink, Hyŏn Myŏngsŏk wanted it even more precisely because it wasn't ready. \"Anything is fine. Just one cup is fine. Give me one cup,\" he begged. Chŏk Hŭi refused again and again, but Hyŏn Myŏngsŏk wouldn't listen.\n\n\"I don't care what happens,\" he said, so Chŏk Hŭi had no choice but to give him some under the condition of \"just one cup.\" Hyŏn Myŏngsŏk returned home bravely and, upon quickly drinking the one cup, immediately stiffened and died right there. His family members, knowing nothing, wept and buried him just as he was. After that, three years passed. Chŏk Hŭi remembered the wine he had given to Hyŏn Myŏngsŏk and went to visit his house. When he asked the family members about Hyŏn Myŏngsŏk's well-being, they looked at him strangely and said, \"Hyŏn Myŏngsŏk already died. It's already been three years.\"\n\nChŏk Hŭi was startled.\n\n\"That must be because of the wine. Since he drank the wine that makes one sleep for a thousand days, he wouldn't have died. Today is exactly the day that the effect of the wine wears off.\"\n\nChŏk Hŭi went with the family members to the grave where Hyŏn Myŏngsŏk was buried. Upon arriving, the top of the grave mound was damp with moisture (水氣), as if it were sweating. They dug up the grave and opened the coffin, and just then, it was precisely the time for Hyŏn Myŏngsŏk to sober up. Hyŏn Myŏngsŏk opened his eyes and mouth and shouted loudly.\n\n\"Ah, that felt really good! Really good. That's truly fine wine. But I have no idea how long I slept.\"\n\nHearing this, the people above the grave all laughed. When they pulled Hyŏn Myŏngsŏk out of the coffin, the smell of alcohol still emanating fiercely from his body stung the nose. It is said that it took three months for Hyŏn Myŏngsŏk to return to his original state.<105>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis article recounts the legend of \"Thousand-Day Wine\" (Ch'ŏnilchu), supposedly brewed by Chŏk Hŭi. A heavy drinker named Hyŏn Myŏngsŏk eagerly consumes an unfinished cup despite warnings, appears to die, and is buried. Three years later, Chŏk Hŭi realizes the wine's effect should be wearing off. They exhume Hyŏn Myŏngsŏk, who awakens precisely then, praising the wine and unaware he has \"slept\" for three years. The story highlights the potency of the legendary wine and the drinker's extreme nature. For historians, the piece offers insight into popular folklore and storytelling published during the colonial period (1941). The use of Hanja alongside Hangul, older grammatical forms, and the theme of a traditional legend provide linguistic and cultural data points from that era, reflecting what was permissible or popular content in mainstream magazines under Japanese rule.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n狄希\t적희\tChŏk Hŭi\n中山縣\t중산현\tChungsan Hyŏn\n千日酒\t천일주\tCh'ŏnilchu\n有州\t유주\tYu Chu\n玄名石\t현명석\tHyŏn Myŏngsŏk\n太白山人\t태백산인\tT'aebaek Sanin\n\n**Glossary**\n\n傳說\t전설\tLegend, folklore\n由來\t유래\tOrigin, history\n中山縣\t중산현\tChungsan County (a place name)\n千日酒\t천일주\tThousand-Day Wine\n古今\t고금\tAll ages, ancient and modern times\n獨特\t독특\tUnique, peculiar\n有州\t유주\tYu Chu (a place name)\n一日斗酒\t일일두주\tOne *mal* (approx. 18 liters) of wine a day; signifies heavy drinking\n酒豪\t주호\tHeavy drinker, strong drinker\n마즈막\t마지막\tLast, final (Older spelling)\n쏜살같이\t쏜살같이\tLike an arrow, very quickly\n안되였소\t안되었소\tIs not ready, is not done (Older spelling/formality)\n먹구\t먹고\tEat/drink and...

The Mainland Christian Publishing World\n\nOn June 5th, Mr. Chŏng In-gwa, General Secretary of the Religious Education Department of the Presbyterian General Assembly, Mr. Paek Nak-chun, Editor-in-Chief of this Society, Mr. O Mun-hwan, Sales Manager of this Society, and myself, the four of us, set out on a tour to inspect the Mainland (內地) and returned to the capital on the 24th of the same month.\nThe primary purpose of this inspection tour was to observe the Christian publishing business in the Mainland, but per the request of the Samch'ŏlli Company, I intend to touch upon the trends in the Mainland Christian world, the future cooperation between the Mainland and Chosŏn Christian communities, and the future of Chosŏn Christianity.\nWhat I keenly felt while inspecting the Mainland this time is that although Chosŏn Christianity holds a distinct advantage over Mainland Christianity in terms of quantity, it lags far behind in its cultural level. Mainland Christianity has a history of 80 years and currently embraces 300,000 believers, whereas Chosŏn, despite having a history 20 years shorter at 60 years, embraces 500,000 believers.\nAlthough overwhelmingly superior in quantity, Chosŏn's Christian publications are truly pitifully lagging in both quantity and quality, and the reading enthusiasm is practically below zero, which is utterly deplorable.\nHowever, despite the Mainland having 200,000 fewer believers than Chosŏn, the vast number of books—hundreds, thousands of types including sermon collections, Bible commentaries, theological works, biographies, translations, meditation books, religious novels, religious poetry collections, children's reading materials, and various other genres—reaches an enormous volume, while Chosŏn's Christian publishing world is incomparably poor. In this, we keenly feel the importance of literature evangelism all the more.\n\nII. Trends in the Mainland Christian World\n\nIn the Mainland, on June 24th and 25th, all Protestant denominations of Japan held a general assembly to establish the \"United Church of Christ in Japan\" (日本基督敎團). This unification movement is truly an unprecedented <106> epochal transformation in the history of world Christianity. We believe this establishment of a glorious new Christian system will make a great contribution to the world Christian community, and we cannot restrain our respect and congratulations for this great new start.\nIt is regrettable that the Old Church Catholic faction (Catholic Church), the Anglican Church, and the Seventh-day Adventist Church, three denominations, could not join the union due to significant differences in doctrine and ritual issues with the Protestant denominations. However, all churches belonging to the Protestant denominations have united. The names of the united churches and the number of full members (baptized members) are listed below (associate members, i.e., unbaptized members, are omitted).\nNihon Kirisuto Kyōkai (Presbyterian) 62,708\nSeien Kyōkai (Methodist) 46,199\nMiho Kyōkai (Methodist Protestant) 3,161\nKumiai Kirisuto Kyōkai (Congregational) 34,172\nDōhō Kyōkai 3,402\nFukuin Kyōkai (Evangelical Church) 2,994\nKirisuto Kyōkai (Disciples of Christ) 2,663\nBaptist Kyōkai (Baptist) 7,200\nLuther Kyōkai (Lutheran) 7,111\nSei Kyōkai (Holiness Church [possibly Sei Ko kai?]) 16,350\nDendō Kyōkai (Evangelical Alliance Mission?) 9,532\nSeika Kyōkai (Holiness Church?) 7,519\nKiyome Kyōkai (Holiness Church) 7,361\nIndependent Churches and Fukurō Kyōkai 7,998\nKyūseidan (Salvation Army) 16,425\nSōketsu Kyōkai (Holiness Church) 619\nTōkyō Kirisuto Kyōkai 2,240\nNihon Itchi Kirisuto Kyōdan 875\nNihon Seisho Kyōkai 584\nKirisuto Yūkai (Society of Friends/Quakers) 757\nNihon Nichiyō Gakkō Kyōkai (Japan Sunday School Association) (Note: not a church).\nThus, the unification of all churches belonging to the Protestant denominations is truly a historic great step.\nA summary of the character and structure of the newly united denomination follows: <107>\n\n1. Character of the New Denomination\n\nIn terms of faith, the new denomination professes Evangelical Protestantism. In terms of organization, it has adopted a \"block system\" (뿔럭식). The denominations, previously divided into over 30 groups, have been integrated into 11 blocks, each conducting its affairs autonomously.\nThe new denomination also professes conciliarism. According to the framework of the Religious Organizations Law, a Moderator (統理者) is appointed for the denomination, and church affairs are executed under their leadership, but this Moderator is by no means a dictator. The operation of church affairs is decided entirely by the resolutions of councils.\nAnother characteristic of the new denomination is its so-called \"Japanese Character.\" With this unification as a turning point, the new denomination intends to start as a church of the Japanese people, born on the soil of our Japan.\n\n2. Structure of the New Denomination\n\nThe structure of the new denomination generally complies with the requirements of the Religious Organizations Law and is divided into three parts: Headquarters, Diocese (敎區), and Church.\nThe term for the Moderator (教団統理者), who oversees the entire denomination, is two years, and they are elected at the General Assembly. Under the Moderator, there are eight bureaus: General Affairs, Domestic Missions, Overseas Missions, Education Finance, Women's Work, Welfare, and Publishing. The directors of each bureau are elected at the General Assembly.\nIn the block system, representatives called Councilors (參與) are elected from each block. The Councilors are responsible for liaison and negotiation between the headquarters organization and each block, and together with the bureau directors, they form the Executive Board (敎務會) as needed.\nThere are six standing committees: Legislation, Teacher Certification, Personnel, Planning, Doctrine, and Judiciary. Committee members are elected by the Council of Councilors (常議員会), and the chairperson is elected by mutual vote among the members.\nThe Dioceses consist of 9 domestic dioceses and 2 overseas dioceses. Mission districts (布敎區) are established in Manchuria, the Republic of China, and the South Seas for evangelism.\nAccording to the denomination's rules, the Diocesan Assembly (敎區會) plays an extremely important role. Matters such as teacher examinations and ordination (按手禮) are included among the responsibilities of the Diocesan Assembly.\nNevertheless, under the block system, most of the Diocesan Assembly's authority is actually exercised by the organs of each block. Individual churches are generally allowed to continue operating according to their traditional organizational practices. However, since the procedure for appointing church supervisors needs to be unified, a system has been adopted where the church selects a candidate supervisor, taking into account the call system (招聘制度), and receives appointment from the Denominational Moderator. Teachers are divided into two types: Ordained Ministers (正敎師) and Assistant Ministers (敎師補). Ordained Ministers are those who have received ordination (按手禮), and Assistant Ministers are those whose ordination is incomplete. A simple diagram illustrating the structure of the new denomination follows: <108>\n[Diagram description embedded in text] Councilors (參與) shall for the time being oversee and represent each block.\nEach block shall for the time being hold block general assemblies, block diocesan assemblies, etc., according to its previous regulations.\n\nIII. The Future of Chosŏn Christianity\n\nAlthough I have titled this section \"The Future of Chosŏn Christianity,\" there is nothing particularly special to note. The general observation is that Mainland Christianity and Chosŏn Christianity will eventually shake hands and work as one denomination, but there is currently no concrete plan for this on either side. However, unification between the Mainland and Chosŏn through Christianity is something both sides earnestly desire. For this to happen, it is imperative that Chosŏn Christianity first undertakes a historic movement similar to the realization of the new denominational union in the Mainland. In this sense, we are optimistic about the future of Chosŏn Christianity, and today, as dependence on foreign countries like Britain and America is being liquidated (淸算), we expect a most vigorous new start based on autonomy. <110>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe author, Yang Chu-sam, reports on his inspection tour of Japan (\"Naichi\") focusing on Christian activities. He contrasts the large number of Christians in Korea (Chosŏn) with the perceived underdevelopment of its Christian publishing compared to Japan's vibrant scene. He details the recent formation of the United Church of Christ in Japan (Nihon Kirisuto Kyōdan), viewing it as a monumental, \"Japanese\" achievement in Protestant unity, outlining its structure under the Religious Organizations Law. Yang expresses hope for a similar unification among Korean denominations and closer ties (\"Naichi-Chosŏn unity\") with the Japanese church, emphasizing the need for an autonomous Korean Christianity free from Anglo-American influence, aligning with the wartime political climate. For historians, the article reveals the pressures on Korean religious leaders during colonialism, the push for Japanization within the church, the state control over religious bodies via the Religious Organizations Law, and the complex discourse blending religious development with imperial ideology (\"liquidating\" Western dependence, promoting \"Naichi-Chosŏn unity\").\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n內地\t내지\tNaichi (Mainland Japan)\n朝鮮基督敎書會\t조선기독교서회\tChosŏn Christian Book Society\n監理敎會\t감리교회\tMethodist Church\n梁柱三\t양주삼\tYang Chu-sam\n長老會總會\t장로회총회\tPresbyterian General Assembly\n鄭仁果\t정인과\tChŏng In-gwa\n白樂濬\t백낙준\tPaek Nak-chun\n吳文煥\t오문환\tO Mun-hwan\n三千里社\t삼천리사\tSamch'ŏlli Company\n朝鮮\t조선\tChosŏn (Korea)\n日本基督敎團\t일본기독교단\tNihon Kirisuto Kyōdan (United Church of Christ in Japan)\n天主敎\t천주교\tCatholic Church\n聖公會\t성공회\tAnglican Church\n安息敎\t안식교\tSeventh-day Adventist Church\n日本基督敎會\t일본기독교회\tNihon Kirisuto Kyōkai (Church of Christ in Japan, Presbyterian)\n聖園敎會\t성원교회\tSeien Kyōkai (Methodist)\n美普敎會\t미보교회\tMiho Kyōkai (Methodist Protestant Church)\n組合基督敎會\t조합기독교회\tKumiai Kirisuto Kyōkai (Congregational Church)\n同胞敎會\t동포교회\tDōhō Kyōkai\n福音敎會\t복음교회\tFukuin Kyōkai (Evangelical Church)\n基督敎會\t기독교회\tKirisuto Kyōkai (Disciples of Christ)\n빠푸테스트敎會\t빠푸테스트교회\tBaptist Kyōkai (Baptist Church)\n루-터-敎會\t루터교회\tLuther Kyōkai (Lutheran Church)\n聖敎會\t성교회\tSei Kyōkai (Holiness Church [possibly Sei Ko kai])\n傳道敎會\t전도교회\tDendō Kyōkai (Evangelical Alliance Mission?)\n聖化敎會\t성화교회\tSeika Kyōkai (Holiness Church?)\nきよめ敎會\t키요메교회\tKiyome Kyōkai (Holiness Church)\n獨立敎會\t독립교회\tIndependent Churches\n普及敎會\t보급교회\tFukurō Kyōkai\n救世團\t구세단\tKyūseidan (Salvation Army)\n聖潔敎會\t성결교회\tSōketsu Kyōkai (Holiness Church)\n東京基督敎會\t동경기독교회\tTōkyō Kirisuto Kyōkai\n日本一致基督敎團\t일본일치기독교단\tNihon Itchi Kirisuto Kyōdan\n日本聖書敎會\t일본성서교회\tNihon Seisho Kyōkai\n基督友會\t기독우회\tKirisuto Yūkai (Society of Friends/Quakers)\n日本日曜學校協會\t일본일요학교협회\tNihon Nichiyō Gakkō Kyōkai (Japan Sunday School Association)\n滿洲\t만주\tManchuria\n中華民國\t중화민국\tRepublic of China\n南洋\t남양\tSouth Seas (Nanyō)\n\n**Glossary**\n\n內地\t내지\tMainland (referring to Japan proper from the perspective of its colony, Korea)\n基督敎\t기독교\tChristianity\n總務\t총무\tGeneral Secretary;

When I graduated from Kyŏngsŏng Medical Specialty School (京城醫學專門學校) in Taishō 9 (1920) and went to study at the Kyoto Imperial University Faculty of Medicine as a Government-General (總督府) funded student, the doctor, despite his advanced age of fifty-eight, was tirelessly dedicating himself with passion and sincerity to nurturing talent.\nThe doctor's appearance (風貌) was vastly different from what I had imagined in Kyŏngsŏng; he was as unimpressive as a humble country bumpkin. He was very short and extremely thin, his head was closely shaved, and his clothing was not a Western-style suit (세비로 紳士服) but always a *tsume-eri* (쯔메에리 - Japanese uniform with a stand-up collar), giving the impression of a government office gatekeeper (官廳門직이). Because of this, there's even an episode <120> where a Korean exchange student who arrived before me, holding a letter of introduction (紹介狀) from the principal of Kyŏngsŏng Medical Specialty School, went into Dr. Itō's room, mistook Dr. Itō for an errand boy (심부럼꾼), and asked, \"Hey, you, is Professor Itō in?\" causing great embarrassment. That's how frugal (儉素) and unassuming (淡白) he was. Moreover, he never used informal speech (반말) with anyone, whether students, nurses (看護婦), or errand boys, always using honorifics (敬語). Despite being so busy (奔忙함), he was the kind of person who would personally reply to every single letter (便紙) he received, regardless of the sender. Furthermore, I cannot help but express my respect for him as a person of merit (功勞者) and character (人格者) who devoted his entire life to research, writing, education, nurturing successors, and treating patients, and whose diligence and upright nature greatly contributed to the development of the Kyoto University Faculty of Medicine. Notably, at the Kyoto University Affiliated Hospital (京大醫學部附屬病院), due to Dr. Itō's insistence (主張) and stubbornness (固執), there were no first, second, or third classes in the hospital rooms (病室). He argued that setting ranks (等級) and treating patients differently when all patients are equally pitiful (불상한데) was an act disregarding (沒覺한) the fundamental spirit (根本精神) of the benevolent art (仁術) of medicine. It was famous at the time that only Kyoto University's hospital rooms lacked this discriminatory treatment.\nHowever, he was a man of few words, unsociable (非交際家), and possessed a scholar's (선비) reserved coolness, making it easy to perceive (看取하기) him initially as cold-hearted (冷情한). But in reality (實은), his nature was to love deeply without showing that affection outwardly. Another peculiarity (特異한) of his character was that once he viewed someone favorably (잘본), he would support them to the end, but he would not engage (相對해주지않는것이다) with those who fell into his disfavor.\nWhen I first went to Kyoto University, despite carrying letters of introduction (紹交狀) not only from the Principal of Kyŏngsŏng Medical Specialty School but also from Dr. Uemura (植村博士), who was famous in Chosŏn (朝鮮), and three other individuals, he wouldn't meet me easily. Several days (數日) after arriving in Kyoto, I finally managed to meet him briefly, but he just glanced up (치다만보고) at me and only gave the instruction (分付) to the assistant professor (助敎援) to assign me a place. For several months (數個月) after that, he didn't provide any research funds (硏究料), and during surgeries or dissections (解剖), among the fifty research students (硏究生), I, being the last to arrive, stood at the very back (맨 끝에서서), making it difficult even to observe (求景할수도), let alone participate in experiments.\nAt Kyŏngsŏng Medical Specialty School, I was the top graduate (一號로 卒業한 秀才) and came as a government-funded selected student (官費選拔生), so I sometimes thought this treatment was too harsh (甚하구나), but this was all my misunderstanding (誤解).\nShortly thereafter (얼마안되여서), the professor left for a research inspection tour (硏究視察) to Europe and America (歐米), again without providing me with any materials (材料供給).\nUnder the resolve (決心밑에서), \"In that case, I will succeed by my own efforts and show him,\" from that day on, I cajoled and persuaded (달래고 꾀이고 해서) the woman in charge (맡은 女子) of the key to the library (圖書室) – which contained rare and precious medical books (珍貴한 醫學書籍) from around the world, unlike other universities, and was not open to the public (公開하지않는다) for fear of book loss (紛失할 念慮) – and managed to secretly (가만히) enter at night (밤이면), studying and researching until the third watch (三更) every night. The insomnia (不眠症) I suffer from even now stems from not sleeping due to diligent research back then. There wasn't a single book (冊이란 冊) in that library that my hands didn't touch, and many books had their dust shaken off (먼지를 털리운) for the first time by my hand. <121> Thus, by the time the professor returned to the country (歸國할 때), I had already completed my thesis (論文) and showed it to him. Knowing well that writing a thesis arbitrarily (제마음대로 作成하면) without the professor's guidance (指導) and material provision (材料供給) would be considered arrogant (건방지다고), and that not only would the thesis not be read, but the person himself would not be dealt with (相對해주지 않는것), I fully expected to be rejected (툇자를 맞으려니). However, unexpectedly (意外에도), the professor read it carefully (精讀하시고) within a week (一週日間) of his return, was extremely pleased (매우 기뻐하시며), not only arranged for its publication in the Kyoto University Medical Journal (京大醫學報) (which usually doesn't publish student theses), but also recommended translating it into English and presenting (내여놓기를) it to the worldwide academic community (世界的學界). Only after the thesis passed (通過되여) the academic society (學士會) and I obtained my degree (學位) did I learn that Professor Itō had been interested (關心) in me from the beginning and had given many instructions (指示) regarding me even to the other professors. I then regretted (뉘우친일이있다) my mistake. Although it feels like self-praise (自畵自讚), it's said that the professor praised only two people in his entire life; one was his disciple who succeeded (뒤를이어서) him as the Dean of Medicine at the same school (同校醫學部長), and the other was this writer (筆者).\n\nPrincipal Fry of Ewha Women's University, Who Devoted Her Life to Chosŏn as a Lifelong Maiden (童貞女)\nPak Indŏk, Principal of Tŏkhwa Girls' School (德和女塾校長)\n\nOne of my unforgettable teachers (恩師), whose memory still lingers, is Miss Fry (푸라이孃), the third principal of Ewha University (梨花大學) (predecessor to Ewha Women's Specialty School, 梨花女子專門). The founder (設立者) of Ewha Haktang (梨花學堂) was Mrs. Scranton (스크랜톤 夫人), and the second principal was Miss Payne (페인孃), but the person of merit (功勞者) who established its complete identity (完全한 面目) as a women's university and elevated its status (昇格시킨) was Principal Fry.\nMiss Fry came over (건너서) to Chosŏn in her young twenties and tirelessly strove for the education of Korean women for a long period (長久한 時日) of twenty-five years. She was truly not only my personal benefactor (恩師) but also one of the benefactors (恩人) of the Chosŏn education world. I believe that the splendid development Ewha Women's Specialty School (梨花女專) shows today is entirely thanks to the benefit (惠澤) of Miss Fry's efforts.\nWhy is that so? At that time, it was the early enlightenment period (開花初期), so to speak, the incipient period of culture (文化의 草創期), and because the conventional (從來의) feudalistic (封建的) and isolationist (鎖國的인) thought (思想) was being overturned (轉倒되고) and new culture (新文化) was being newly imported (新輸入), it formed a transition period (轉換期). Therefore, it was a time when there was no understanding (理解가 없던때) of women's education. The first graduating class (第一回卒業生) had three students, the second <122> graduating class (第二回卒業生) had four, and the third graduating class consisted only of this writer (筆者). However, her sublime passion for education (崇高한 敎育熱), rooted in the farsighted (先見的) stance (立場) that even if only such a small number (少數) of students were produced (輩出될지라도), one must simply endure (그냥 참아) and advance (나아가야된다) for the future (앞날의) Chosŏn women's education, along with her firm conviction (굳은 信念) and unbroken fighting spirit (鬪志를꺽지않었던), commands unwavering respect (敬意를 表하기를 아끼지않는바이다).\nMiss Fry used \"Pura\" (富羅) as her Korean name (朝鮮名). Her personality (性格) was that of a person of silence (無言의 人), so to speak, who made practice (實行) rather than words the first principle (第一義) of her life (生活). She was also a person of sincere faith (眞實한 信仰家) and a person of reason and intellect (理智의 人) with good judgment (判斷力) regarding matters (事物).\nWhen I attended (通學하던때) Ewha Women's University, around the third and fourth years of Taishō (1914-1915), my age (年齡) was around eighteen. At that time, it was divided (노니였으며) into Ewha Women's Elementary Course (梨花女子小學科), Ewha Women's Middle School Course (梨花女子中學科), and Ewha Women's University Course (梨花女子大學科). The middle school was a three-year system, but the university course was a five-year system (五年制) with one preparatory year (豫科一年) and four main course years (本科四年), making it an impeccable (손색이 없는), excellent (훌륭한) highest institution of learning for women (女子最高學府). I studied (修學했으며) under Principal Fry (푸라이孃의 門下) since my middle school days (中學時節부터) and, after finishing university (大學을마치고), taught (敎鞭을 잡었던) at Ewha Middle School, so I spent nearly ten years (近十年間) with Principal Fry. Because of this relationship (關係로), not only was the affection between teacher and student (師弟間의 情) deep, but our friendship (友情) was also profound (두터웠던것이다). When I graduated from middle school, Miss Fry, already past forty (四十고개를넘은), gifted (선물해) me five *ma* (다섯마) of American-made (米國製) cotton cloth (옥양목), which is still fresh in my memory (記憶에 새로우며). At Christmas time every year, she would give me various things like a towel (乎巾), pajamas (잠옷), underwear (內衣), and soap (비누), saying,\n\"This is a gift (선사하는것이다) from an angel (天使가) who looked favorably (어여삐 보아서) upon your life (生活) this past year (一年間).\"\nHer words (말슴) still seem to ring clearly (쟁쟁울리는것만같다) in my ears. Furthermore, the various memories (가지가지 追憶) of past times (옛 時節) – like occasionally making and eating food (飮食) together at her private residence (私宅), playing happily (즐겁게 노던) at night (밤이면) with games (遊戱), entertainment (娛樂), and songs (노래로), or the school opera performances (校內歌劇會) and big athletic meets (大運動會) held under Principal Fry's guidance (指導下), where not only parents (學父兄) but also general citizens (一般市民) would gather like clouds (雲集하여), forming a sea of people (人山人海를 이루던) – make me admire (仰慕케항다) the image (面影) of Principal Fry even more.\nAnyway (여째던), Miss Fry made great contributions (貢獻이컷었으며) in many aspects (多方面으로) during the nascent period (胎動期) of Chosŏn women's education, left pioneering footprints (先驅者的足蹟), and returned to her country (歸國했던것이다) after passing the age of fifty (五十이 지나서). When I went to America (米國) years ago (年前), I went to visit (찾아갔더니) her, but she had already passed away (世上을 떠났고). I met her younger sibling (동생), shared dinner (저녁도 가치 나누고) together, and even personally (親히) went to see (가서 보았다) the hospital room (病院의 病室) where she passed away (別世했다).<123>\n\nWorld-Renowned Scholar Dr. Sombart, Who Built a \"Nest of Love\" After Turning Sixty\nYi Kŭngno, Korean Language Society (朝鮮語學會), German Economics PhD (獨逸經濟學博士)\n\nAmong my teachers (恩師) during my time at Berlin University (伯林大學時節), I can never forget Dr. Sombart (솜바르트 博士) more than anyone. He was a great (偉大한) scholar, world-renowned at the time (當時) for his socio-economic historical research (社會經濟史的硏究) and writings (著述). He was particularly the foremost person (一人者) in establishing an economic historical system (經濟史的體系), and a genius among geniuses (天才中의 天才) in methodology (方法論), critique (論評), and writing (著述). Though it is said that geniuses lack virtue (天才는 薄德이라하나), he was a unique existence (特異한 存在) possessing both scholarship and virtue (德을 가축). It is said that a famous Russian (露西亞) economist at the time came to study under him (氏의 門下), receiving lectures (講議) on economic theory (經濟議論) and paying the enormous sum (巨額) of fifty dollars (五十딸라) (100 Yen/Won - 百圓) per hour (時間); from this, one can truly guess (可히 짐작할수있을것이다) his fame (名聲).\nDespite being an old man (老軀) over sixty (六十이넘은) at the time, he spared no effort in training many disciples under him, raising them into renowned scholars. I, too, received his guidance (指導) for three years in the Berlin University research room.\nUnder him (氏의 門下), there was a limited quota (定員二十名이라는 限定) of twenty research students, making it very difficult to obtain a spot. Furthermore, most (大部分) of the disciples had not only graduated from university but many had already obtained (獲得한 者) their academic degrees (學位). Among these twenty, I was the only East Asian (東洋人) disciple receiving instruction. Except for twenty-three Russians (露西亞人二十三名), almost\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n잡지명\t삼천리 제13권 제9호\n발행일\t1941년 09월 01일\n기사제목\t잊지못할나의 恩師記\n필자\t獨逸伯林大學솜바르트 博士 李克魯, 京都帝國大學伊藤■三 博士 朴昌薰, 梨花女子大學校長라이孃

한분이다.\n伊藤博士는 當時 京都帝國大學醫學部長이면서 外科敎授를 兼한 世界的으로 이름을 떨친 天才學者로서 내가 大正九年에 京城醫學專門學校를 卒業히고 總督府官費生으로 京都帝大醫學部에 遊學갔을때 博士는 五十八歲라는 高齡의 老軀임에도 不拘하고 熱과 誠으로 人材養成에 不撓의 努力을 거듭하고 있었다.\n博士의 風貌는 내가 京城에서 想像했던바와는 엄청나게도 딴판으로 한 개 보잘것없는 촌뚜기와같이 변변치못했다. 키가 몹시 적고 몸이 바짝 마른데다가 머리를 빡빡 깍았고, 衣服은 세비로 紳士服이 아니고 쯔메에리만 꼭 입기 때문에 만치 官廳門직이와같은 印象을 주었다. 그랬기 때문에 나보다 먼저왔던 朝鮮人 留學生이 朝鮮서 가지고 온 京城醫專學校長의 紹介狀을늘고 伊藤博士의 室에 들어가서 伊藤博士를 심부럼꾼으로만 알고\n「あん, 君 伊藤先生んらつしゃゐか?」\n하여서 망신했다는 에삐소-트까지＜120＞있다. 그토록 氏는 儉素하고 淡白한분이다. 게다가 氏는 學生은 無論, 看護婦나 심부럼꾼이나 어떠한 사람에게든지 반말을 쓰지않고 반드시 敬語를 使用하며, 그렇게 奔忙함에도 不拘하고 어떠한 사람에게서 오는 便紙던지 가리지않고 一一이 回答해주는 性格의 所有者다 더욱이 그가 一生을 硏究와 著述과 敎育과 後進養成과 患者治療에 바쳤으며 勤勉하고 剛直한 性稟으로 京大醫學部의 發展을 爲해 애쓴 功勞者요 人格者인것에는 敬意를 表하기를 아끼지않는다. 特히 京大醫學部附屬病院에는 伊藤博士의 主張과 固執으로 因 해서 病室에 一二, 三等이라는 等級이 없었다. 患者는 다 가치 불상한데 等級을 定해놓고 治療해준다는것은 仁術의 根本精神을 沒覺한 行動이라하여서, 그 當時 京大의 病室에만 이 差別待遇가 없었던것은 有名한 일이였었다.\n그러나 氏는 말이없고, 非交際家인데다가 선비다운 쌀쌀한 맛이 있어서 一見 그를 冷情한 者로 看取하기 쉬운데 實은 속으로 사랑하면서도 그 愛情을 表面에 나타내지 안흔 性 벽이었다. 그리고 氏는 性格中 特異한 하나는 自己가 한번 잘본 사람이면 끝까지 그를 後援해주고 氏의 눈에 잘못보인 者는 相對해 주지않는것이다.\n내가 처음 京大에 갈 때 京城醫專校長의 紹交狀은 勿論, 그外 朝鮮서 이름이 높던 植村博士外에도 세분의 紹介狀을 가지고 갔는데도 좀처럼 만나주지않고, 京都에 간지 數日만에 하루는 겨우 만났으나 그저 치다만보고 助敎援더러 자리를 定해주라는 한마디 분부만 있을뿐이었다. 그리고 數個月이 자나도 硏究料를 주지않고 手術이나 解剖때에는 五十名이나되는 硏究生中에 나는 마지막으로 온 關係로 맨 끝에서서 實驗은 둘째로 치고 좀처럼 求景할수도 없었다.\n京城醫專에서는 내가 一號로 卒業한 秀才라고해서 官費選拔生으로 왔는데 너무 甚하구나하고 생각한 적도 있었으나 이것이 모두 나의 誤解이었다.\n그러자 얼마안되여서 先生은 歐米로 硏究視察을 떠나면서도 亦是 나에게 아무 材料供給이 없었다.\n나는「그럴바엔 나는 내힘으로 成功해서 보여주리라」는 決心밑에서 그날부터 다른 大學에는 없다는 世界各國의 珍貴한 醫學書籍만 들어찬 圖書室(이 圖書室만은 普通人에게 書籍을 紛失할 念慮가있어서 公開하지않는다)의 열쇠를 밭은 女子를 달래고 꾀이고 해서 간신히 밤이면 가만히 들어가 每日밤 三更까지 工夫하고 硏究하였었다. 내가 不眠症을 얻어서 지금까지 苦生하든것도 그때 熱心히 硏究하노라고 자지못한 까닭이오, 또 圖書室의 冊이란 冊엔 모두 내손이 가보지않은것이 없으며, 내손에서 처음 먼＜121＞지를 털리운 冊도 많았었다. 그리하여 先生이 歸國할 때 나는 이미 論文을 完成하여서 先生에게 보였다 先生의 指導와 材料供給도 받지않고 제마음대로 論文을 作成하면, 건방지다고 그 論文을 읽어주지않는것은 無論, 사람까지 相對해주지 않는것을 잘아는 나는 으레 툇자를 맞으려니 했더니 先生은 意外에도 歸國한 날부터 一週日間에 精讀하시고 매우 기뻐하시며 京大醫學報(學生의 論文은 發表해주지않는다)에 發表해주실뿐아니라 英語로 飜譯해서 世界的學界에 내여놓기를 勸해주었다. 그리고 그 論文이 學士會에 通過되여 學位를 얻게 된뒤에야 伊藤先生이 처음부터 나에게 關心을갖고 敎授들에게까지 나에게 對한 指示가 많았던것을 알고 나는 내잘못을 뉘우친일이있다. 自畵自讚하는 感이 없지않으나 先生은 先生의 一生에 두 사람밖에 稱讚해준일이 없다하는데 그 두사람 中의 하나가 先生의 뒤를이어서 同校醫學部長이 된 先生의 弟子요, 다음 하나가 筆者였었다.\n\n一生을 童貞女로 朝鮮에몸바친-梨花女子大學校長라이孃\n德和女塾校長 朴仁德\n\n\n\n나의 恩師中의 한사람으로서 아직까지 내 記憶에서 사라지지 않는분은 梨花大學(梨花女子專門前身)의 第三代校長푸라이孃이다. 梨花學堂의 設立者는 스크랜톤 夫人이요 第二代校長은 페인孃이였으나 女子大學으로 完全한 面目을세우고 昇格시킨 功勞者로는 푸라이校長이였던것이다.\n푸라이孃은 二十代의 젊은 年歲로 朝鮮에 건너서 朝鮮人女子敎育을 爲해 二十五年間이라는 長久한 時日에 亘해서 不撓의 努力을 거듭한 實로 나 個人의 恩師일뿐아니라 朝鮮敎育界의 恩人中 한사람인 것이다. 梨花女專이 今日의 찬란한 發展을 보여준것도 全혀 푸라이孃의 努力의 惠澤이라고 생각한다.\n웨 그런고하니 當時는 開花初期여서 이를테면 文化의 草創期요 및 從來의 封建的이오 鎖國的인 思想이 轉倒되고 新文化의 新輸入으로 因하여 한 轉換期를 이루웠던까닭으로 女子敎育에 理解가 없던때였기 때문이다 第一回卒業生이 三人, 第二回＜122＞卒業生이 四人, 第三回卒業生 筆者한사람뿐이였으나 그러나 이러한 少數의 學生이 輩出될지라도 앞날의 朝鮮女子敎育을 爲해서는 그냥 참아 나아가야된다는 先見的인 立場에서 굳은 信念과 함께 鬪志를꺽지않었던 그 崇高한 敎育熱엔 敬意를 表하기를 아끼지않는바이다.\n푸라이孃은  朝鮮名으로는「富羅」라고썼으며 그 性格은 말보다도 實行을 生活의 第一義로 하는 이를테면 無言의 人이였었다. 그리고, 眞實한 信仰家요 事物에 對한 判斷力이있는 理智의 人이기도 했다.\n내가 梨花女子大學에 通學하던때는 내 年齡이 十八歲前後이던 大正三, 四年項인데, 그때는 梨花女子小學科, 梨花女子中學科, 梨花女子大學科로 노니였으며 中學은 三年制였으나 大學科는 豫科一年, 本科四年인 五年制에서 손색이 없는 훌륭한 女子最高學府였었던 것이다. 나는 中學時節부터 푸라이孃의 門下에서 修學했으며 大學을마치고 梨花中學에서 敎鞭을 잡었던 關係로 近十年間이나 푸라이校長과함께지냈다. 그랬기 때문에 師弟間의 情도 情이려니와 友情도 두터웠던것이다 내가 中學을 卒業하던때 이미 四十고개를넘은 孃은 米國製옥양목 다섯마를 선물해 주던것이 아직도 내 記憶에 새로우며 크리쓰마스때면, 每年 乎巾과 잠옷과 內衣와 비누等 여러 가지를 주면서\n「이것은 天使가 네 一年間의 生活을 어여삐 보아서 선사하는것이다」\n하던 말슴이 지금도 내 귀에 쟁쟁울리는것만같다. 더욱이 때때로 孃의 私宅에서 飮食도 만들어 가치먹고 밤이면 遊戱와 娛樂과 노래로 즐겁게 노던 일이라던지, 或은 푸라이先生의 指導下에 校內歌劇會와 大運動會같은때는 學父兄은 無論, 一般市民까지도 雲集하여 人山人海를 이루던 옛 時節의 가지가지 追憶은 푸라이先生의 面影을더욱 仰慕케항다.\n여째던 孃은 朝鮮女子敎育의 胎動期에 있어서 多方面으로 貢獻이컷었으며 先驅者的足蹟을 남기고 五十이 지나서 歸國했던것이다. 내가 年前米國에 갔을때 孃을 찾아갔더니 孃은 이미 世上을 떠났고 孃의 동생을 만나서 저녁도 가치 나누고 또 孃이 別世했다는 病院의 病室까지 親히 가서 보았다.＜123＞\n\n回甲지나서「愛의 巢」를 이룬-世界的學者 솜바르트博士\n朝鮮語學會 獨逸經濟學博士 李克魯\n\n\n\n伯林大學時節의 나의 恩師로는 누구보다도「솜바르트」博士를 잊을수 없다. 氏는 當時 社會經濟史的硏究와 著述로서 世界的으로 이름이 높았던 偉大한 學者였었다. 特히 經濟史的體系를 세운이로서는 氏가 一人者일것이며, 및 方法論, 論評, 著述로서는 天才中의 天才였었다. 天才는 薄德이라하나 氏는 學問과 德을 가축 特異한 存在였으며 當時 露西亞의 有名한 經濟學者한분이 氏의 門下에와서 經濟議論의 講議를 받는데, 한 時間에 五十딸라(百圓)이라는 巨額을 支拂하면서 修學했다하니 可히 그의 名聲을 짐작할수있을것이다.\n氏는 當時 六十이넘은 老軀임에도 不拘하고 그 門下에 많은 弟子를두어 著名한 學者로 길러내기에 努力을 아끼지 않았으며, 나도 三年間이나 伯林大學硏究室에서 氏의 指導를 받았다.\n氏의 門下에는 定員二十名이라는 限定된 硏究生을 두기 때문에 좀처럼 자리를 얻을수 없으며 더욱이 弟子의 大部分은 모두 大學을 卒業하였을뿐아니라 學位까지 獲得한 者가 많았었다. 이 二十名中에 東洋人으로는 내가 唯一한 弟子로서 敎授를 받았었으며 露西亞人二十三名을 除하고는 擧皆가 獨逸人이였었다.\n人間的으로서의 氏의 性格은 매우 包容性이 크고, 또 弟子를 사랑하는 마음이 두터워서 一週日에 一次씩(二時間)의 公開講演이 있은 뒤에는 으레 弟子를드러\n『나와가치 食堂으로 갈사람이 없느냐. 가고싶은 者는 다 따라나서라.』\n말하고는 大學에서 얼마 되지않는 가까운 食堂으로 간다. 無論, 따라나서라고해서 料理값을 氏가 支拂하는것은 아니다. 食堂에서 다시 師弟間의 硏究로 因한 意見交換이 벌어진다. 나는 種種 이 食堂에서 氏와 이야기할 機會를 갖게되는것을 限없는 기쁨으로 삼았었다.\n이것은 한 餘談이지만 氏가 한동안은 學校에 나오시지 않더니, 講義揭示板에 一個月餘의 休暇廣告＜124＞가 發表되였었다. 며칠뒤에 알아보니, 일찍이 夫人의 別世로 相當히 오랫동안 獨身生活하시던 氏가 六十四才의 高齡임에도 不拘하고 結婚해서 新婚旅行을 떠났다는것이다. 그 再婚한 婦人이란 다른이가 아니고 氏의 門下에서 敎授받던 불가리아國의 젊은 女子였는데 이를테면 師弟間의 戀愛였었던 것이다. 新婚旅行의 地는 妻家가 있는 불가리아였으며 一個月後에 돌아온 氏는 語弊가 있을지모르나 매우 明朗해젔었다. 그리고 氏의 家庭 살림살이란 實로 깨가 쏟아지듯 매우 和樂하여 文字그대로「愛의 巢」를 이루고 있어서 希望의 的이였었다 더욱이 六十四歲인 老人으로써 첫아들을 보았을때의 그의 기쁨이란 實로 形言하기 어려웠다.\n-끝-＜125＞\n＜120-125＞","magazine":"삼천리 (三千里)","date":"1941년 09월 01일 (September 1, 1941)","title":"Record of My Unforgettable

Military Aircraft Donated by Korean Compatriots Residing in Fukuoka\n\nKorean compatriots residing in Fukuoka Prefecture (福岡縣), recognizing the pressing current situation, have been dedicating their utmost sincerity as citizens of the home front through慰問 (comfort visits) to front-line soldiers and families of deployed soldiers, labor service, and more. As a commemorative project celebrating 2,600 years since the founding of the Empire last year, funds for donating weaponry were being collected from Koreans residing in Japan who are joint members of the Central Kyōwakai (中央協和會) and the Kumamoto Prefecture (熊本縣) Kyōwakai. The fruits of that sincerity were recently realized, gathering a large sum totaling 520,000 Won from across the country. Of this, 500,000 Won was used to donate five military aircraft (軍用機) each to the Army and Navy authorities, and a portion of the remaining funds was donated as relief money for soldiers (恤兵金) to the Kumamoto ○○ Hospital on the 18th.\n\nOne Million Won Mark Not Far Off – Tally of Donations to the Naval Military Office Since the Incident\n\nSince the Incident [Second Sino-Japanese War], the fervor for donations reflecting the sincerity of the home front citizens continues unabated, growing ever stronger. Looking only at what was donated through the Naval Military Office (海軍武官府) during June, there were 176 instances of monetary donations totaling 10,295 Won, and 83 instances of relief money for soldiers (恤兵金) totaling 7,395 Won, for a combined total of 17,000 Won. Besides this, there were 3,840 comfort bags (慰問袋), 8,000 units of tobacco, and over 4,000 comfort letters. The annual statistics for monetary donations and relief money handled by the military office since the beginning of the Incident are as follows, showing the number of instances increasing acceleratively, highlighting the zeal of the home front citizens. That is, in Shōwa 12 (1937), there were 30 instances totaling 449,037 Won; in Shōwa 13 (1938), 69 instances totaling 138,499 Won; in Shōwa 14 (1939), 80 instances totaling 42,658 Won; in Shōwa 15 (1940), 155 instances totaling 204,396 Won; and in Shōwa 16 (1941), as of June 30th, 1,021 instances totaling 142,222 Won. <126>\n\nApostles of Korea-Manchuria as One – Autumn Brilliance Shining on the Continent; Manchuria Moved by Korean Youth Corps Service\n\nThe Manchurian Construction Labor Service Korean Youth Corps (滿洲建設勤勞奉仕朝鮮青年隊), which departed to offer the precious sweat of their service for the construction of Manchuria, left for Yanji (延吉) and Dongshengyong (東盛湧) in Manchukuo (滿洲國) with about 260 members at the end of last month. Possessing the fervent special will, \"We will offer even these bodies for the construction of Manchuria!\", they are performing their sacred work without a single person falling ill, according to a report received from Manchukuo on the 22nd. Letters of gratitude for their hard work have arrived at the Government-General (總督府), reportedly evoking admiration from all quarters by revealing the beautiful spirit of Korea-Manchuria as One (鮮滿一如).\nSpecifically, they are divided into the Yanji group and the Dongshengyong group. In each group, all members rise at 5:30 AM to the wake-up call bugle, perform the morning obeisance (배례), and do joint combined gymnastics. Then, from 7:30 AM to 12:00 PM, and again from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, they endure the continental heat all day long, carrying out vigorous labor service. The passion for Manchurian construction reportedly shines on their copper-tanned skin.\n\nSincerity of Three Million Provincial Citizens – Kyŏnggi Province Donates 50,000 Comfort Bags\n\n11,700 comfort bags (慰問袋) filled generously with the home-front sincerity of the three million members of Kyŏnggi Province's Patriotic Squads (愛國班) were gathered at the Provincial Office (道廳) by the 22nd. Consequently, on the 23rd, Provincial Office staff began packing them into wooden boxes for donation to the Chōsen Army Patriotism Department (朝鮮軍愛國部). The comfort bags contain items like snacks and cigarettes, and also include handkerchiefs personally made with great care by female Patriotic Squad members, deeply moving the clerks (게원) handling the items. This is the second batch collected from various districts (部郡); 17,400 bags were donated last March, and another 15,900 are scheduled for donation again in November. Therefore, the number of comfort bags sent to the front line through the home-front sincerity of Kyŏnggi provincial citizens this year alone will reach 50,000.\n\nOne Thousand Won National Defense Donation – Sincerity of Mr. Hiranuma of Nonsan\n\nMr. Pyŏngnum Yŏnbyŏng (平沼燕炳氏) of 64 Asahi-chō (旭町), Nonsan-ŭp (論山邑), Nonsan County (論山郡), regretful that he could not offer the sincerity of service through his occupation (職域奉公) as a home front citizen due to a deep-seated chronic illness (身病) that kept him constantly confined to his sickbed, visited the local police station (當地警察署) and donated 1,000 Won in cash for national defense. He left, saying he would be grateful if this could atone for even a ten-thousandth part of the 'sin' of not being able to fulfill his national duty (國民義務). <127>\n<126-127>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis article reports several instances of \"patriotic\" contributions by Koreans under Japanese rule in 1941. These include a large monetary donation by Koreans in Fukuoka, Japan, to purchase military aircraft; ongoing monetary donations to the Japanese Navy; the labor service of a Korean youth corps in Manchukuo, lauded as embodying \"Korea-Manchuria as One\"; the collection and donation of tens of thousands of comfort bags by residents of Kyŏnggi Province; and a personal donation for national defense by an ill man in Nonsan. The article highlights the mobilization of Korean resources and manpower for Japan's war effort, framed as voluntary acts of loyalty and sincerity towards the Empire. For historians, this piece is valuable as propaganda illustrating the pressures and narratives used to compel colonial subjects' participation in the war, showcasing specific mechanisms like donation drives, labor corps, and local patriotic squads (애국반), as well as the promotion of imperial ideologies.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n福岡縣\t후쿠오카현\tFukuoka Prefecture\n朝鮮\t조선\tChōsen

뜻이라함니다. 해가솟는나라, 日本의 나라가 東亞新秩序建設의 全責任을 兩眉에 메고 躍進하고 있는것은 一種宿命的인 일가티 생각됨니다 그러기에 此際에 이러한 歷史的事實을 根據로하여, 具體的으로 日本精神이 發展하여온 過程을보고, 또 그것이 如何히 움지겨 왔는가를 國民들은 집히 認識하고 省察하여야 할바인줄암니다.\n그리하야 日本精神이란것을 日本民族의 生活理想(西村眞次) 日本民族의 傳統的信念及憧憬(河野省三)이라든가\n日本民族에 本來부터 가추어있는 一種特有한 精神으로 單只 知情意味만이아니다. 그모든것을 內包한 全一精神이다(井上哲次郞)이라든가 또는 端的으로 愛國心(淸原貞雄)이라든가 日本歷史를 創造하여내는 主體(鹿子木員信)이라는 等等 여러 學者가 定義하는바있는데 나는 그러한 議論은 他人에 讓하고, 오직 우리 日本民族의 피가 通하고 있는 作品行動, 文學에서말하는바 作品에 어떻게 담기여있는가를 살피기로 하겠습니다.\n그런데 國文學에 담기운 日本民族의 마음이 어떻게 表現되였는가, 結規의큰것으로는 西紀十一世紀 後半에된「源氏物語」인 外 學者의 說을빌면 이 作品에도 適應性, 可動性, 受容性, 그리고 派生된 平和性, 道德性, 協調性等이 日本民族性의 顯著한

또\n\n御民われ生るしるしあり天地の榮ゆる時にあへらく思へぼ\n\n이것은 萬葉集卷六에있는 노래로 聖武天皇의 詔에 應하여 海大養岡磨가 부른노래인데 어떻게나 國民으로서 國家의 繁榮에 깁버하며 이나라에 태여난 기쁨을 眞情으로 을픈노래임니까. 또 萬葉의 三十卷에 火長今春部興會布라고하는 賤한 身分가진 防人도\n\n今日よりはかへりみなくて大君のこの御楯といてたつわれな\n\n라고 노래불렀습니다. 이렇게 모다들 忠君至情에 불타는 노래가 日本文學에는 一貫하여있습니다.\n\n끝으로 우리 日本의 島地性의 位置는 生物學的으로보면 普通말하자면 保守的으로서 發展性에 弱하다하기쉽지만은 도로혀 火山島의 特徵으로 地震이있고, 颱風있어서 그속에서 살고있은 住民들은 이모든 刺戟 때문에 不絶히 生活이 움직기고있습니다. 더구나 四面이 바다에 싸여있음으로 雄大한 氣象을 가질 수 있습니다. 그러기에 日本民族이 茫茫한 大海저쪽에 生活의 資源을어더 놀 雄飛하려하는 것은 自然의 歸趨라고 할것으로 文學에있어서도, 이 日本心이 國文學에 充滿히드러있음을 볼 수 있습니다.＜131＞\n\n哲學講座-永遠히 向上하려는-人格美의 哲學-超悲劇의 哲學\n\n梨花女專敎授哲學博士 韓稚振\n\n\n一, 生存의 非悲劇性\n讀者는 一目에 本表題에 對하여 誤解하기쉬울것같음으로 먼저말해두러는것은, 筆者가 悲劇의 哲學을 말하고 生存의 非悲劇性을 論한다고해서 悲觀主義者가 아닌것을잊어서는 안된다는것이다. 事實, 悲觀主義나 樂觀主義는 事物觀察에 있어서 같이 感傷的見解를 말하는것이요 客觀的立場은아닌것이다. 다시말하면 生이 悲劇이라해서 그것을 悲觀하려는것은 眞理探究의 精神에서 어그러지는 主觀的立場이다. 우리는 眞理를 사랑하는 者로서 事實을事實대로 當面할것뿐이요 主觀的是非에 拘束되어 事實을 曲解해서는 아니된다. 生의 悲劇은 언제든지 悲劇으로만 終始되는것도아니요, 때로는 悲劇의 反對되는 喜劇으로 變轉하여 나갈수도 있는것이 이 變轉無常한 世態인것이다. 이變轉無常이야말로 그 自體가 悲劇의 始作이 되지아니하면안된다.\n먼저 悲劇이란 무엇인가. 悲劇의 悲라는글 字는 아프고슬픈것이라는뜻이니, 이는 本心의 非 卽, 自然心의 本來傾向에 反 하는 心情인듯하다. 그런 故로 사람마다 劇悲에서 避하려하지 아니하는가. 또 劇이라는글字는 事實이아닌것을 일부러 꾸미어서 事實처럼나타내는것을이름인데, 이것 亦是 本心과어그러지는 表現을말한다. 그러고보니 本心과 그 反對 假心이라고할가와의 衝突이 悲劇의 本意인것이다. 本心과 本心, 自然과 自然의 衝突은 悲劇이 아니요 生存競爭인것이다. 生存競爭에 따르는 아프고슬픈것도 自然現象으로 悲劇이아니다.\n世俗에서말하는 孤兒를 남기고 父母가 早死하는것, 義公苦痛을 當하는것, 他人을 球하려다가 自己가 犧＜132＞牲을 當하는것, 弱者가 强者에게 搾取를 當하는것 等도 悲劇이라고하는 것보다 自然한 生存競爭에서 생기는 失手요 不幸이요, 人間의 悲劇이라고할수없다. 悲劇의 骨子는 하지아니하려는것을하는것, 하려는것을하지아니하는데있다. 그러나 해야할것을 하지아니하는것, 하지아니할것을하는것은 懶惰요 動物的快다.\n故로 悲劇은 悲劇은 自律的克己的의 것이다. 다시 簡單히말하면 참된사람 現實以上의 사람다운사람이되는 自己否定的義務를 다못하는데서 悲劇이생기는것이다. 이런故로 悲劇은 否定의 뜻이많다. 卽自由意志의 決裁如何에서 悲劇이 發生하는것이요 動物的衝動의 生活에서는 悲劇이없는것이다. 悲劇은 超人間이 되는 媒介다.\n悲劇은 두 反對의 勢力의 衝突에서 생기는것이나 모든 衝突은 悲劇이아니다. 卽以上에 例한 自然的生存競爭에 있어서의 本能的愆望等의 衝突이나. 愆望과 環境과의 對立狀態도 悲劇이아니다. 이本能을버리고저 本能을따라가는 行動이나, 環境을 征服하므로써 本能的要求를 채우는것은 自然生活의 當然한것으로서 悲劇이아닌것이다. 生의 環境과의 對立鬪爭으로말하면 爲先 生이 本來부터 存在하는것이아니라 이것 亦是 生理的으로는 兩異性의 結合作用으로 因하여 成立되고 精神的으로는 物心의 相互關係의 影響으로말미아마 心으로 形式되는 것은 勿論이러니와, 小我와 大我와의 結合으로더욱 完全한 自我卽人格의 形式으로 出現하는것이다. 環境도스스로 完成物로 存在하는것이 아니라 生命이 있는 까닭에 存在하게되고, 그 內容에있어서도 여러 生命의 衝突事件이 進行하고있으므로 因하여 環境으로 나타나게되는 것이다.\n이모든 衝突의 裏面에는 衝突하려는 意志 卽存在하려는 衝動이라고 假定하지아니할수없다. 이는 歷代哲學者, 聖人들이 達觀한생각인데, 例하면 東洋에서는 陰陽說이있으며 西洋에서는 惰憂의 對立說, 辯證論等이 그것이다. 이렇다고 宇宙의 原理를 두가지로보는것은아니다. 한가지 存在하려는 衝動이 本質的으로 對立的衝突的이요, 兩極的이라는것이다. 무엇이든지『하려는』狀態에있는것은 다 兩極性을 內包하고잇는 綜合狀態인것, 卽生의 體인것을 알수있다. 卽「있으려하는것」는 있는것과 없는것의 綜合體이니 웨그러냐하면 이는없는것에서 있으려하는 過程인까닭에 有無의 兩極이 그中에 孕胎하여있는것이다.\n以上과같은 生存의 普通的衝突現狀이 悲劇이라하여, 그것을 悲觀할수없는 理由는 첫째, 있다가없어지는것이나, 없다가 있어지는것＜133＞이 自然의 現象이니 구태여 슬프고아픈것없는까닭이다. 이 自然現象을 悲觀하는것은 역지 自然的衝動의 表現으로서 悲劇的喜劇이라하지아니할수없다. 나는새가 버리지를잡아먹고 버리지가 草木을먹고 草木이 ■素를 먹어버린다든지, 소가 草木를먹고, 사람이 소를잡아먹으며, 사람이 未開人을 搾取해먹으며, 麥飯을버리고 쌀밥을 取하는것이 모두 自然現象의 表現이니 구타여 悲劇이라고 할수없는것이아닌가. 魚類는 生存數以上으로 增殖하여 多數가 殺戮을 當하는것이 原則이되었다. 獸類에 限하여서도 環境의 變遷에따라, 옛날것은 退化하여 殘滅을 當하여 恒常 新型의 動物이 生存할수있게 되었다. 이러한 進化狀態에있어서 있든것이없어지며없든것이 있게된다면 그것이 悲劇이라거나 創作이라고 할수없는것이다. 다시말하면 生存의 猛烈한 競爭은 生存하려는 衝動의 必然的傾向으로서 그것을 善惡의 道德的判斷으로 解決할수없는것이다. 善하다고해도 그대로 進行할것이요 惡하다고해도 그대로 依然히 進行할것이다. 自然的生存競爭이 悲劇的이라는것은 사람의 主觀的判斷에 不過하다. 이 自然界의 不斷한 生存競爭의 現象은돌이어 反悲劇的이요 反人間的이다. 動物的存在에는 悲劇을 演出할 資格조차 없는것이다 人間界에있어서도 金力있고 權力있는 者가 女性을유린하고 無力者를 利用하는것도 悲劇이라고할 수 없고 다만 動物的階段에있는 非道德이요 非人間的行動이라고는 할수있으나, 悲劇이라고는 할수없다 悲劇은 이모든 自然的現象을 否定에서 動物以上의 生의 飛躍이 出現한다. 이러한 悲劇은 自制, 自律的人間界에서만 出現한다. 悲劇의 人은 벌서 超人間이다.\n\n二, 人間의 自覺과 悲劇\n이런 故로 自然그대로의 生存에서는 悲劇이 演出할수없는것이다. 自然의 生活은 放縱이요 死鬪요 終極은 滅亡이다. 이滅亡에서 救出될길은 自然의 生活을 否定하는 悲劇을 通하여서만 可能하다. 이悲劇의 創造者는 理性의 開拓者인 哲學的人間이다. 旣述한바와같이 事實을 否定하는데서 悲劇이생기는것이므로 現實的事實의 立場에서보면, 모든悲劇은 歌劇처럼보여지는것이다. 卽 本心을 假心으로써 否定하는 人爲劇이되는것이다.\n事實中에 가장 嚴然한 事實은 現實이요, 現實的事實中에 가장 中心的인것은 人間이다. 現實的人間을 否定하는것이다. 現實이 否定은 現實的人間의否定에서 始作하고,＜134＞現實的人間의否定은 現實的自我否定에서 發足한다. 그러면 이否定的過程은 어떻게 始作되는가.\n모든 否定은 自覺에서 되는것이다. 自覺은 現實에서 始作되고 現實은 自覺에게 否定된다. 自覺은 覺悟이니 卽 무엇을깨닷느냐하면 現實只今이 틀렸다는것을 깨닷는 것이다. 어떤것이잘되었다고 깨닷는 境遇에도 벌서다른어떤 現實的인것이 틀렸다는것(虛空)을 깨닷는뜻이다. 이自覺의 內容은 現實그대로 肯定하는 直覺과 그것을否定하는 反省이 包含된 綜合的 肯定이라고도 할수있으나, 現實을 克服하는 點에있어서는 消極的否定의 意味가 强한것이다. 自覺의 最初段階라할수있는 直感에있어서는 現實이 가장嚴重하고 必然的으로나타나지마는, 事實上 直覺하고보면 現實은 한 개條件的現實 卽다음 段階을 出現시킬 可能狀態에 不過하게되어 처음 必然性으로 나타났든 現實은 直覺中에 吸收되어 없어지고마는것이다. 처음에는 옳은것이 틀린것이 되는 同時에 틀린것은반듯이 克服되지아니할수 없는것이다. 즉 틀렸다는것은 옳은것을 覺悟한까닭이므로 後者가 前者를 代身하게 될수밖에없다. 萬若 不然일것같으면 틀렸다는생각이 처음부터 생겨질수가없는것이다.\n自覺內容은 肯定과 否定하는것밖에 아무것도없다. 現實은그참다운 內容이요 거기다가 肯定否定의 形式을 附加하는데 不過하다. 말하자면 自覺은 形式的規定의 作用이다「스피노자」의말과같이 모든規定은 否定이라한다면, 自覺은 否定的意味밖에 없다고할수있다. 規定은어떤 形式下에서 旣存事實 卽現實을 把握하는것인데, 無邊한 現實을 否認하면서 有邊有限한 現實로 肯定한다는뜻이다. 無邊無限을  有邊有限의 어떤物體로 把握하는 自覺은 純全한 否定的消極的行動이라할수없고 創作的이라고 하지아니할수없다. 卽有形物의 存在가 自覺的規定에서 出現하는것이다. 이런故로 自覺은 無內容한 形式的原理라고 할수있는 同時에 一定한 內容을 만드러내는 具體的 創造的原理라고할수있다. 例를들면 本能的으로 무엇이든지먹고 마시려 할때에,『그래서는 아니된다』는 自覺으로써 本能을 規定하는 行動은 分明히 먹으려는 本能의 內容을 豊富히한다거나, 그 制定으로 因하여 自覺의 內容이 成立되는것은 아니나, 그러나, 그自覺의 制定으로 因하여 새로운 形式의 生이 始作할수있게되는것이니, 이것을보면 自覺이 積極的 創作的意義를 가젔다고 할수있는것이다.\n이 自覺力은 어떻게생겨젔는가. 進化論에 依하면 自然動物이 進化＜135＞함을따라 本能에서 感覺이생기고 感覺이 知覺이되고 知覺은 推理其他思考作用으로 發展되어 그中에서 自覺이생긴다고하나, 이는 一般知性의 發生을 말하는것이고, 以上에말한 肯定及否定의 役割을하는 自制力으로서의 自覺을 論議하는것은아니다. 進化에서 出現한 知性은 本能과같이 生의 道具다. 卽 知性은 道具를만드는 技術인데, 이것을 所有한 人間을『道具를만드는 動物』이라고하게된것이다. 그러나 知性의 道具를 所有한 人間만으로는 自己를 否定하는 悲劇을 演出할수없는것이다. 그는 理性의 自覺的人間이 되지아니하면 참다운 人間의 悲劇을 實現할수없다. 知性은 自然的生活을 더 自由스럽게 나가게하여, 어떤 境遇에는 下等動物以上으로 利己의 生活, 暴惡한 生活을 하게하는 것으로 決斷코 自制의 悲劇을 꾸미어낼수없는것이다.\n悲劇의 原動力인 自覺은 人間의 本質로서 누구든지 그可能性을 가지고있다. 이는 動物的自然生活에서 進化되었다는것보다 自然的人間以上의 階段로올라가려는것이 그 特色이니만큼 非自然的이라고할수있다. 人間이 人間으로만 늘있는것을 願치않고 그 以上을 指目하고나가려는데 그 價値가있는것이니 이는 反現實的自覺의 力이있는까닭이다. 卽 人間이 그 現實을 否定하는 悲劇을 通하여 그 以上가는 新悲劇의 準備에로 突進하는데 그 人間된 資格이 發揮되는것이다. 悲劇을 通하여 永遠히 向上하려는것이 自覺의 使命이다.\n\n三 , 哲學의 超悲劇性\n哲學은 事實의 硏究가아니다. 科學들은 事實을 硏究하는것이다, 哲學은 以上에말한 人間的悲劇의 硏究다. 卽自覺展開의 硏究다. 自覺하는것은 哲學하는것이요 어떻게 哲學하는것인가 하는것을 硏究하＜136＞는것이學問으로서의 哲學이다. 自覺이 限定된 知識이아니다. 다 안다 (全知)거나 다 모른다 (無知)거나하는 決定에서 出發하는것이아니라, 無知를알면서 全知를 모르는 中에서 哲學이 發生하는것이다.\n그런데 웨 哲學하려하는가, 웨 自覺하려하는가. 그것은 悲劇을 演出하기 爲하는까닭이요 悲劇은 自覺의 必然한 結果인까닭이다. 悲劇의 目的은 勿論悲壯의 美를 表現시키는데 있는것과같이 哲學의 目的은 自覺의 悲劇을 通하여 人生의 人格的美 卽거륵한 人格(神格)의 表現에 있는것이다. 이것이 超悲劇的哲學의 뜻이다.\n人類의 歷史는 自然的生活을 肯定하는 生存競爭과, 自然的生活을 否定하는 悲劇的理知의 生活과의 對立鬪爭史인것이다. 하나는 自然을 神聖視하는 生活이요 또하나는 理性을 神聖視하는 生活이다 前者는 量과 廣의 生活이요 後者는 質과 深의 生活이다 하나는 物質的生이요 精神的生이다. 옛날의 希臘, 現代의 西洋은 自然生活, 科學의 生活을 爲主하고, 옛날의『히브리』와 東洋은 精神的生活, 宗敎와 哲學의 生活을 目標하고나간것이다. 前者는 喜劇의 生活이고 後者는 悲劇의 生活이라고할가.＜137＞\n\n(文學講座) 文章作法\n梨花女專講師 李泰俊\n\n\n文章作法은 이미 있었다.\n東洋의 修辭나 西洋의 레토릭(Rhetoric)은 애초부터 文章作法은 아니요 辯論法이였다. 文章보다는 言語가 먼저 있었고 出版術以前에 辯論術이 먼저 發達되어 修辭法이니 레토릭이니는 다말하는 技術로서의 起源을 가졌던 것이다. 그러다가 한번 印刷機가 發明되어 文章이 大量으로 出版되고 말보다는 文章이 時間的으로, 空間的으로 長壽할수 있어 文章은 演說보다 絶大한 勢力으로 人類의 文化를 指導하게된것이다.\n따라 近代에 와 修辭學은 말보다 글의 修飾法으로서 完全히 轉用되는 運命에이르렀다.\n그런데 朝鮮서는 散文에서는 이 修辭를 理論한바가 極히 적었다 적으면서도 過去의 文章을 읽어보면 修辭觀念에 억매지 않은 文章이 별로 없다. 批判이 없이 이 盲目的으로 漢文體를 模倣하여, 修辭로 因해 發達이 아니라 도리여 中毒에 빠지고말았다.\n\n金風이 潚颯하고 玉露凋傷한대 滿山紅樹가 猶勝二月花辰이라 遠上白雲石巡하야 共詠停車坐變楓林晩之句가 如何오\n(어느尺牘大方에서)\n\n친구에게 丹楓구경을 가자고 請하는 편지다. 그런데 한마디도 自己네 말이나 感情은 없다. 玉露凋傷은 杜詩「玉露凋傷楓樹林」에서, 猶勝二月花辰이란 唐詩「霜葉紅於二月花」에서, 遠上白雲石巡이란「遠上寒山石巡斜 白雲深處有人家」에서, 停車坐愛楓林晩이란 唐詩「停車坐愛楓林晩」에서 그대로, 모다 古典에서 따라 넣어 連絡만시킨 것뿐이다. 제 글보다 典故＜138＞에서 널리 남의 글을 잘 따다채우는것이 過去 文章作法의 重要한 一門이었다.\n얼마나 自己를, 個性을 沒覺한 그릇된 文章精神인가.\n\n이때, 좌수 비록 망처의 유언을생각하나 후사를 아니 돌아볼수 없는지라 이에 두루 혼처를두하되 원하는 자 없으매 부득이하여 허씨를 취하매 그 용모를 의논할진대 양협은 한자이넘고 눈은 롱방울 같고 머리털은 돗태솔 같고 키는 장승만하고 소리는 시랑의 소리 같고 허리는 두아름 되고 그 중에 곰배과리며 수중다리에 쌍언챙이를 겸하였고 그 주둥이는 써을면 열사발이나되고 얽기는 멍석 같으니 그 형용을 참아 견대여 보기 어려운중 그 용심이 더욱 불측하여……\n(「薔花紅蓮傳」외 一節)\n\n薔花와 紅蓮의 繼母되는 許氏의 描寫다. 이런 人物이 事實로 있었다 하드래도 自然性을 살리기 爲해는 그中에도 가장 特徵될만한것만 한두가지를 指摘하는데 끄쳐야 할것이다. 春香傳에, 李道令이 春香의 집에 갔을때, 果實을 내오는 場面 같은데도 보면, 그 季節에 있고 없고, 그 地方에 나든 안나든 생각해볼새 없이 天下의 果實 이름은 모조리 주서섬기는데, 그런 誇張이 亦是 過去 修辭法이 끼친 重大한 弊害의 하나이다.\n\n過去 우리文學에 좋은 作品이없었든것은 먼저 좋은 文章이 없었기 때문이다. 春香傳 같은것도 그 文章 마저 典故 誇張, 對句等에 억매지 않었어 보라 얼마나 그대로 傳承할수 있는, 完全한 小說이요, 完全한 戱曲이였으랴!\n東洋에 있어 修辭理論의 發祥地인 中國에서도  胡適은 그의「文學改良芻議」에서 다음과같은 여덜가지 條目을 들은것이다.\n\n一, 言語만 있고 事物이 없는 글을 짓지 말것.\n(즉 空踈한 觀念만으로 꾸미지 말라는것)\n二, 病없이 呻吟하는 글을 짓지말것.\n(空然히 오! 아! 類의 哀傷에 쏠리지 말라는것)\n三, 典故를 일삼지 말것.\n(우에서 例든 丹楓구경 가자는 편지처럼)\n四, 爛調套語를 쓰지 말것.\n(허황한 美詞麗句를 쓰지 말라는것)＜139＞\n五, 對句를 重要視하지 말것.\n六, 文法에 맞지 않는 글을 쓰지 말것.\n七, 古人을 模倣하지 말것\n八, 俗語, 俗子를 쓰지 말것.\n\n이 八個項目中에 一, 二, 三, 四, 五, 七의 여섯은 直接間接으로 舊修辭理論에 對한 抗議라 볼수있는것이다.\n그런데 여기서 한가지 理解하고 나려갈 事實은 그처럼 弊端이 많은 在來의 修辭法이 過去에 있어선 무엇으로써 그렇듯 適應性을 가져온것인가하는 點이다.\n活版術이 幼稚하던 時代에 있어서는 오늘처럼 冊을 求하기가 쉽지 않었을것이다. 따라서 한 卷 冊을 가지고 여러사람이 보는수밖에 없었고, 또는 文盲人이 많었기 때문에 자연이 한 사람이 읽되 소리를 내어 읽어 여러사람을 들리는 경우가 많었을것이다. 소리를 내어 읽자니 文章이 먼저 朗讀調로 써지어야할 必要가 생긴다.「文章 곳 말」만이 아니라 音樂的인 一面이 더한가지 必要하게 되었던것이다. 內容은 아무리 眞實한 文章이라도 소리내어 읽기에 거북하거나 멋이 없는 文章은 널리 읽히지 못하였을것이니, 쓰는 사람은 內容보다 먼저 文章에 爛調套語를 對句體로 많이 넣어 노래調가 나오든 演說調가 나오든, 아모튼 朗讀子의 목청에 興이 나도록 하기에 注意하였을것이다. 더구나 過去의 修辭法이란 文章을 爲해보다 辭說을 爲한거이였던만큼 文章을 朗讀調로 修飾하기에는 가장 合理的인 方法인데다가 客觀的 情勢까지 그러하였으니 더욱 反省할 餘地는 없이 典故와 誇張과 對句같은데 沒頭하지 않을수 없었을것이다.\n「쌀은 곡식의 하나다. 밥을 지어 먹는다.」\n先生이 이런 文例를 주면\n「무는 채소의 하나다. 김치를 담어 먹는다.」\n이런 文章을 써놓아야 글을 잘짓는 學生이었다. 自己의 感覺이란 使用될데가 없었다. 楊子江以南에서「霜葉紅於二月花」라 한것을 二月달에 꽃이라고는 냉이 꽃이나 볼지 말지한 朝鮮에 앉아서도 허턱「滿山紅樹가猶勝二月花辰」이라하였다. 뜻이 어떻게되든, 말이 닿든 안 닿든, 그것은 문제가 아니었다. 오직 글을 지으면 된다. 自己神經은 딱 封해두고 作文 그대로 文章의 造作이었다. 여기서 새로 있을 文章作法이＜140＞란 글을 짛는다는 거기 對立해서\n첫째, 말을 짛기로 해야 할것이다.\n글짛기가 아니라 말짛기라는데 더욱 鮮明한 認識을 가져야 할것이다. 글이 아니라 말이다. 우리가 表現하려는것은 마음이요 생각이요 感情이다. 마음과 생각과 感情에 가까운것은 글보다 말이다.「글 곳 말」이라는 글에 立脚한 文章觀은 舊式이다.「말 곳 마음」이라는 말에 立脚해 最短距離에서 表現을 計劃해야 할것이다 過去의 文章作法은 글을 어떻게 다듬을가에 主力해 왔다. 그래 文字로 살되 感情으로 죽이는수가 많었다. 이제부터의 文章作法은 글을 죽이더라도 먼저 마을 살려 感情을 살려놓는데 主力해야 할것이다.\n둘째, 個人本位의 文章作法이어야 할것이다.\n말은 社會에 屬한다. 個人의것이 아니요 社會의 所有인 單語는 個人的인것을 表現하기에 原則的으로 不適當할것이다. 그러기에, 言語에 依해서 個人意識의 個人的인것을 他人에게 傳하기는 不可能하다는, 悲觀的인 結論을 가진 學者도 없지 않은바다.\n아모튼 現代는 文化萬般에 있어서 個人的인것을 强烈히 要求하며 있다. 個人的인 感情, 個人的인 思想의 交換을 現代人처럼 切實히 要求하는 時代는 일직이없었을것이다 그런데 感情과 思想의 交換, 그 手段으로 文章처럼 便宜한것이 없을것이니 個人的인것을 表現하기에 可能하기까지 方法을 探究해야할것은 現代文章硏究의 重要한 目標의 하나라 생각한다.\n電話로 말소리를 그대로 드를뿐 아니라 텔레비전죤으로 저쪽의 表情까지를 마조보는 時代가 되었다. 어찌 文章에서만 依然히 尺牘大方式, 萬人的인 套式文章에다가 現代의 複雜多端한 自己의 表現을 依賴할수 있을것인가.\n셋째, 새로운 文章을 爲하 作法이어야 할것이다.\n산사람은 生活 그 自體가 언제든지 새로운것이다. 古典과 傳統을 無視해서가 아니라「오늘」이란「어제」보다 새것이요「내일」은 다시「오늘」보다 새로울것이기 때문에, 또 生活은「오늘」에서「어제」로 가는것이 아니라「오늘」에서「내일」로 나가는것이기 때문에 비록 意識的은 아니라 하더라도 누구나 精神的으로, 物質的으로 작고「새것」에 부드처 나감을 어쩌는 수가 없을것이다. 아모리 保＜141＞守的인 머리를 가진 사람이라도 生活自體가 無限한 새날을 通過해나가는, 그 軌道에서 逆行하지는 못한다. 어떤 平凡한 生活者이든 不可不 새것의 表現이 나날이 必要해지고 만다. 表現하지 못하고 새것을 依然히 舊式으로 非效果的이게 表現해버고마는 사람이 大部分이다.\n言語는 이미 存在한것이다. 旣成의 單語들이요 旣成의 토들이다. 부드처보는 생각이나 感情을 이미 經驗한 單語나 토로는 滿足할수 없다는것이 成立될수 있는 理論이다. 繪畵에서처럼 제 感情대로 線이나 色彩를 絶對의 境地에서 그어버릴수는 없지만 第三者에게 通해질수 있는 限에서는 用語와 새로운 文體에의 意關는 必然的으로 要求되며 있다.\n現代 佛文壇에서 가장 非傳統的 文章으로 非難을 받는 폴ㆍ모-란은 自己가 非傳統的 文章을 쓰지 않을수 없는 答辯을 다음과 같이 하였는데 그 答辯은 어느곳 文章界에서나 傾聽할 價値가 있다고 생각한다.\n\n勿論 나도 完全한 傳統的인, 그리고 古典的인 佛蘭西語로 무엇이고 쓰기싶기는 하다. 前에 먼저 나에겐 나로서 말하고싶은것이 따로 있는것이다. 더욱 그 나로서 말하고싶은 그런것은 유감이지만 在來의

作曲手法演奏法等으로 繼承한 樂家들이 이든, 모오차르트, 배트호휜이다. 이 三大古典家를 理解하려면 먼저 南獨逸만하임 樂派의 意義를 알아야할것이다. 그런데 오랫동안 만하임樂派의 價値는 認定을 받지못하던것이 近來에와서 후고리만博士의 硏究發表로 因하여 世人이 三大古典音樂과 同樣의 價値를 音樂史上에 認定케된것은 特히 注目할일이다.\n이 三大古典音樂家와 만하임音樂이 如何히 交涉이 되었는지를 먼저 알아보자.\n모오츠아르트는 十一歲時 十月에 母親과같이 뮌헨及 아우그스부르그를 經由하여 當時에 歐洲에서 第一有名한 樂都만하임에 倒着하였다. 이 當時에 이곳에 選擧公의 樂部는 이때에도 隆盛하여서 歐洲에서 第一가는 오페라 管絃樂團이있었다 이때에 靑年로츠아르트는 그곳서 有名한 指揮者간나비히와 交際하게되어서 그곳 管絃團으로부터 新式演奏法을 배호게되었다. 그리고처음으로「클라리넷트」木管樂器의 價値를 알게되었다.\n베트호벤은 十四歲의 少年으로 自己故鄕 본市宮廷 오페라劇場에서 비올라 奏者로 또는쳄발로 奏者로써「올테스터」에 添加하여 當時에＜143＞有名하든 伊太利及佛蘭西오페라 作品과 獨逸作品으로는「글룩」으로「모츠아르트」의 歌劇까지알게되었다. 特히 當時본 市에서는 만하임派의 藝術이 많이

어떻게 잘했든지 管絃樂의 漸强演奏할때에는 聽衆이 椅子에서 自發的으로 緊張되어서 이러서게되였고 漸弱演奏時에는 亦是自發的으로 緊張되어서 이러서게되였고 漸弱演奏時에는 亦是自發的으로 椅子에 앉게되였다고 한다 만타임樂團의 콘체르트 마이스터 요한수타미츠는 自己作曲씬포니 及室內樂에 前에 漸强漸弱記號를 쓰지않든것을 現記號로 記人했다 後輩樂聖 모츠라르트及베트호훤이 질겨서

硏究의 對象으로 삼는 學問을 動物學이라 이르고, 植物에 關한것을 硏究하는 科學을 植物學이라 이르는것과 마찬가지다. 그러나 言語를 硏究하는 學問이라할지라도 어떠한 한가지 或은 數種의 國語에 對하여 다만 그 意義를 배울뿐으로 그 國語를 말할줄 알고, 들을줄 알며, 읽을줄 안느것, 卽 實用的硏究만으로는 言語學이라 이를수 없다.\n植物이나 動物의 外形만 알고서 이것은「소나무」요, 저것은「대」라고 判別하며, 이것은「개」요, 저것은「도야지」라고 알아내는것만으로는 植物學이나 動物學이 成立되지 못한다. 어떠한 植物이나 動物의 外形을 아는 同時에 內部構造와 그 機能, 作用, 習性, 變化를 分析的으로 觀察吟味하여 그 本質을 認識하며, 同時에 植物이나 動物 全般에 關한 分類, 系統까지 論及하지 않으면 植物學이나 動物學이라는 科學을 이루지 못하는것과 마찬가지다.\n그러므로 言語學도 言語의 本質, 言語의 構成, 言語의 起源, 言語의 發達變遷의 狀況과 法則, 言語分裂의 原因, 言語의 內容과 外形, 世界各地에 對한 言語의 種類, 分布, 其他 言語에 關한 一切現象을 觀察硏究하는 體系的論述이 아니면 안된다.\n이 우에는 言語學은 言語를 科學的으로 硏究하는 學問이라고 말하였다. 그러면 그「言語」라는것은 어떠한것인가. 言語의 定義가 무엇인가, 하는것이 問題된다.「言語」가 무엇이라는것을 가장 完全히 解答하는것은 結局 言語學 全體다. 言語學의 硏究가 充分히 되＜146＞여 있지 않으면「言語」가 무엇이라는것을 完全히 說明할수없는터이다. 그러나 大體로「言語」란 어떠한것인가를 먼저 알어보지 아니하면「言語學」이런것이 어떠한아지 못하는 事象을 硏究의 目的 或은 對象으로 삼는일이 되기 때문에 우선 常識的으로 言語가 무엇인가를 알아볼 必要가 있다고 생각한다.\n言語라는것은 表出運動中의 한가지다. 表出運動이라는것은 우리의 思想이나 感情等 모든 意識內容이 外部에 나타나는 一切의 行動을 가르키어서 이르는 말이다. 어디가 앞을 때에 얼골을 쨍그리는것이나, 놀랐을 때에 외마딧소리를 지르는것이나 무서울 때에 몸이 덜덜 떨리는것은 모다 表出運動이다. 그리고 이 表出運動에는 有意的運動과 無意的運動의 區別이 있으니, 有意的表出運動은 우리가 그렇게 하려는 意思를 가지고 意識的으로 行하는 運動이다. 이를터이면 不愉快한 表情을 할 때에 눈썹을 찡그리는것이라든지 사람을 부를 때에 손을치는것 같은것이다. 그리고 無意的表出運動이란것은 이를터이면 손으로 뜨거운것을 만지고 질것을 하여 그 물건에서 손을 떼는것이라든지 前記한 例中 놀랐을적에 외바딧소리를 지르는것과 같은 種類의 運動이다.\n우리 人類의 이러한 表出運動에는 여러 階段도 있고 여러 種類도 있다. 廣義的으로 생각하면 旗를 들고 여러 가지 方法으로 흔들어서 相對者에게 어떠한「군호」를 한다든지, 呼角을 불어서 一隊의 學生을 指揮한다든지, 門에 달린 電鈴을눌러서 主人을 불러내는것과같은것도 亦是 表出運動의 한가지라고 볼수 있다. 그리하여 相對者는 그 表出運動에 依하여 表出者의 意思를 짐작하는것이다.\n人類의 言語도 亦是 이 表出運動의 一種이다. 卽言語는 有意的表出運動인데 그 手段으로 分節된 音聲은 使用하는것이다. 分節된 音聲이란것은 音節과 音節로 한 걸음 더 나아가서는 그 音節을 다시 母音과 子音으로 나눌수 있는 소리니, 바람 부는 소리, 물흐르는 소리, 새 우는 소리, 개짖는 소리等과 같은것은 到底히 音節音節로 나눌수 없다. 要컨대이와같이 分節된 音聲의 一個나 或은 數個의 聯結體를 使用하여 어떠한 意思를 表出하는것이 곧言語다.\n따라서 言語는 外部에 나타나는 形式으로는 分節된 音語이있고, 內部에 包含된 實質로는 意義가 있다. 그런데 言語의 이 音聲과 意義와의 結合은 必然的으＜147＞로 되는것이 아니오, 그 社會의 習慣속에 자라서 固定하여진것이기 때문에 社會가 다르면, 同一한 意義를 表하는데 同一한 音聲을 使用하는 일이 거위없다. 例를들면「人」이란 內容을 가진 말을 表示하는 音聲은 各社會가 똑같니 아니하고, 或은「사람」이라 發音하고, 或은「ヱト」가 되며, 或은Man이 되었다.「水」의 槪念을 가진 말도 亦是 그러하여「물」,「ミヅ」,「Watas」等과 같이 音聲上顯著한 差異가 있다. 이것은 다 그 言語가 成立된 環境 卽 社會의 習慣이 같지 않었기 때문이다. 이러한 理由로 各方言의 區別이 생기고 또는 各國語의 差異도 成立되였다.\n이로 보면 言語는 人類의 表出運動中의 一種으로서,\n(1) 첫재 形式으로 音聲이 있고\n(2) 둘재 內容을 意義가 있고\n(3) 어떠한 一定한 音聲과 一定한 意義가 結合하는것은 온전히 그 言語를 使用하는 社會의 習慣 속에서 成立되었다.\n그리고 이와 같이 成立된 言語는 또한 無秩序 無統制한 斷片 乃至 斷片의 集合體가 아니오, 緊密한 組織이 있나니,\n(4) 그 組織이 이루어진 由來와 理由가 있고,\n(5) 그 組織이 運用되는 法則이있다. 以上은  言語의 定義를 常識的으로 槪括的으로 말하였거니와, 이와같은 言語를 硏究하려면 어떠한 方法과 計劃으로 着手하여야할가.\n(一) 材料의 蒐集이오.\n(二) 그 蒐集한 材料를 整理할것이오\n(三) 整理하여얻은 結果를 比較할것이다.\n이렇게하면 어떠한 結論을 얻을 수 있을것이나, 實際의 硏究過程은 이렇게 單純치 아니하니, 材料整理에 있어서는 分析的硏究와 綜合的硏究가 必要할것이오, 材料의 蒐集 乃至 比較에 있어서는 時間的으로 古今을 通하여 할것이오, 空間的으로 各地域에 亘하여 할것이다. 前者를 通時的硏究(或은 垂直的硏究)라 이르나니, 이와같은 硏究 아래에 音韻, 語義, 文法의 變遷發達이 究明될것이오, 後者를 共時的硏究(或은 水平的硏究)라 이르나니, 方言學, 言語地理學, 比較言語學은 이러한 硏究아래에 成立된것이다.\n다시 말하면 言語學의 根本目的이 言語를 科學的方法으로 處理하여, 言語에 關한 知識을 完全한 體系로 組織하여놓은데 있으므로, 世界人類가 現在 使用하고있는 各種言語에 對하여 그 事實을 可及的 廣汎 豊富히 蒐集하여, 그것을 觀察, 比較, 分類하고(共時的硏究), 이밖에 옛날부터＜148＞人類가 使用하여 오든 言語 卽 古語에 對하여서는 同樣으로 取扱하여 言語變遷의 歷史으로 明白히 할것이다(通時的硏究). 대개 科學的硏究라는것은 個個이 事物을 調査, 吟味하는것으로부터 出發하여 (分析的硏究) 全體에 對한 完全한 體系的知識에 到達하지 않으면 안된다(綜合硏究).\n그리하자면 우선 個個의 事物을 比較하여 그사이에 共通되는 點과 差異되는 點을 發見하는것이 重要한 일이 되나니, 言語에 있어서도 各個人이 各境遇에 實地로 使用하는 一回一回의 言語活動을 比較하고, 各方言을 比較하고 各國語를 比較하며, 다시 各時代의 言語實을 比較하여, 그 結果 各者의 共通된 性質과 特殊한 性質을 區別, 分類하여나가면 모든 言語의 共通되는 性質도 알게 될것이다. 性質이 所謂 最高理論이라든지 根本原理라고 부르는것이다 그리하여 다시 이 根本原理를 基本으로하여 모든 言語事實을 綜合하는것이 所謂 全體의 體系가 되는것이다. 이와같이 全體의 共通的原理를 찾어내는 同時에 一面으로는 各個의 特有한 差異 卽 特質을 찾어볼 때에는 體系中의 各部分이 全體에 對하여 어떠한 關係를맺고, 어떠한 位置를 占領하였는지 알것이다. 말하면＜149＞各個의 性質이 一層 明瞭하게 날아나는것이다. 卽 例를 朝鮮語에 取하면, 그 言語學的硏究에 依하여 朝鮮語도 一般 言語로서 가져야할 根本原理를 가지고 있는  同時에 다른 言語와같지 아니한 朝鮮語로서 獨特한 特質을가지고있는것을 發見할수 있게된다.\n그리고 이 言語學에 어떠한 分科가있느냐하면, 比較的 새로운 學問이나 近年에 相當히 活潑한 進展을 보이어, 言語의 定義를 말한데서 要約한 順序에 依하여 列擧하여보면,\n(1) 音聲에 關한 것으로 音聲學, 音韻學, 韻律論, 言語美學等이있고,\n(2) 意義 方面으로는 語義論, 語彙學等.\n(3) 에는 語原學, 言語心理學, 位相論等.\n(4) 에는 形態論, 系統論, 構成論等.\n(5) 에는 文法論, 文章論, 樣式論等이 있다.\n그리고 通時的硏究로는 言語史, 文法史, 音韻史, 言語學史, 言語社會學, 言語哲學, 文字學等을 들수 있으며, 共時的硏究로는 方言學, 言語地理學, 比較言語學等이있다.\n이것들은 그中 重要한 部門들이며, 이各部門들은 各各獨立할 別個의 部門을 이루는 同時에, 다른 部門과 裁然한 單獨의 存在가 아니오, 互相 相關關係와 依存關係를 가지는것이다.＜150＞\n＜129-150＞","magazine":"삼천리 제13권 제9호","date":"1941년 09월 01일","title":"Culture Lecture Series on Paper (First Installment)"},{"path":"86_13.09_1941.09/174.txt","issue":"86_13.09_1941.09","content":"The Freedom of Culture and the National Defense State - Discussing the Flaws of Culture-Supremacism -\n\t\t\t\t\t\tArmy Information BureauㆍArmy Colonel Suzuki Kōzō\n\nI. The National Defense State and the Populace\n\nOne of our misunderstandings is that the National Defense State is temporary and not perpetual. That is, there are not a few people who think that things like prioritizing the public good (公益優先), selfless devotion to the public (滅私奉公), all people assisting the throne (萬民輔翼), or the controlled economy (統制經濟) are abnormal buzzwords that exist only because of wartime. There are those who hold the mistaken belief that once the China Incident (支那事變) ends, we might return to an era celebrating the individualism, liberalism, and democracy of the pre-Incident period. In any case, as it has been seventy years since we were influenced by Western thought, there are not a few who have been poisoned by this erroneous thinking to the point of blindness (病■盲), so attempting a sudden 180-degree turn to build a new system (新體制) is met with considerable friction. Such people truly see the New System and the National Defense State as abnormal and temporary. However, when the world, as in the present day, has entered a dead end, and warfare evolves, changing from armed conflict to total war (總力戰), not only during times when concrete armed conflict is occurring, but also when it is not, invisible ideological warfare (思想戰), diplomatic warfare (外交戰), and economic warfare (經濟戰) are constantly being waged. If we do not ensure we are never defeated in these invisible battles, the existence of the state, the stability of national life, and the development of culture cannot exist. If the National Defense State and the New System are for that purpose, they will certainly not be suddenly dissolved just because the China Incident ends. Furthermore, building a National Defense State involves changing the very foundations of thought and realizing this in laws, institutions, customs, and habits, so it will not suddenly revert to the previous system just because armed conflict ends. <152> And warfare, once evolved, may evolve further with the development of culture, but it does not regress. If the state's defense system corresponding to such warfare is the National Defense State, then it was rather mistaken not to have been a National Defense State until now. Therefore, in building the National Defense State, we must look ahead fifty, one hundred, several hundred years into the future. It affects not only our generation but extends far to our descendants. Of course, things like 'supu' socks that get holes after one day's wear, or receiving rations of rice or coal through the ticket system (切符制度), will return to how they were before once armed conflict ends. However, the system that harnesses and uses the maximum comprehensive power (綜合力) of people, materials, and culture for the state's objectives through the unitary organization, control, and operation incorporating all elements of moral defense (度義國防) must be considered something that will continue indefinitely.\n\nII. The National Defense State and Freedom\n\nThe next misunderstanding is the erroneous view that life in the National Defense State and freedom cannot coexist. Those tied to the past ideas of individualism, liberalism, and democracy seem to think that the National Defense State and freedom cannot coexist, but this is a grave error; true freedom in its genuine sense and the National Defense State can splendidly coexist. Even when speaking of liberalism (自由主義), there are various kinds of freedom. There is freedom in a moral sense, freedom in a psychological sense, and freedom in a legal sense. Moral freedom means autonomously realizing the correct essence of freedom, so this freedom splendidly coexists with <153> life in the National Defense State. Psychologically, whether it is a National Defense State or not, it is said that humans actually lack that freedom. If so, perhaps those in the world who cry out that the National Defense State and freedom cannot coexist are thinking of legal freedom. Legal freedom is actually \"freedom in the permitted sense.\" In other words, it is freedom guaranteed by law and permitted by law, for example, the freedom that Japanese subjects (日本臣民) possess freedom of belief within the scope of the law, or freedom of movement, or freedom of speech, association, and publication, or the freedom to freely trade goods within the scope of commercial law. Regarding the question of whether such freedom coexists with the National Defense State, engaging in futile conceptual games (觀念의 遊戱) is pointless, so it is necessary to firmly grasp what the substantive content of freedom and lack of freedom is. I think of the substantive content as follows:\nThat is, I believe that what aligns with existing laws, institutions, customs, and habits is freedom, and what does not align is lack of freedom. Now, the laws, institutions, customs, and habits of the world are, at some point, absorbed by the people living in that society and become the habits of each individual. Therefore, it follows that what aligns with an individual's previous habits is freedom, and what does not align is lack of freedom. For example, in the past, it didn't matter what one did as long as one had money, whether buying and wearing luxurious clothes (著侈), buying a private car and driving around for strolls or to the theatre while freely using gasoline (깨소령), it was fine. However, as the National Defense State emerged, with control over funds and goods, such vanity can no longer be permitted. Because of this, those who had habits of vanity in the past feel extremely constrained. Also, students who, in the past, would get a certificate from school to buy a discounted ticket (割引乘車券) and commute by vehicle even for a distance of just one kilometer, now cannot ride for distances under two kilometers, which must have felt extremely restrictive at first. Also, going to a restaurant and indulging for twenty or even thirty yen per person, now that lunch is capped at two yen fifty sen and dinner at five yen, must feel very insufficient and lead to dissatisfaction. However, this lack of freedom is ultimately a matter of habit, so if one cultivates habits of true living, one will not feel restricted. In other words, the problem of freedom versus lack of freedom will cease to exist.\nIn the era before the National Defense State, there were not infrequent times when even genuine intentions for the state could not be realized, obstructed by unreasonable forces (理不盡한 勢力). However, in the National Defense State, correct intentions that align with the state's objectives and the public good (公益) can be realized as much as one wants. That is, the realm of positive, genuine freedom will expand. Thinking this way, <154> viewed from all angles, the National Defense State and freedom splendidly coexist. To think they do not coexist is due to being captive to an erroneous concept of freedom.\n\nIII. The National Defense State and Culture\n\nThe next misunderstanding is the idea that the National Defense State and the creation and development of culture cannot coexist. Literary figures of liberalism and cosmopolitanism somehow seem to think that the National Defense State and the creation and development of culture cannot coexist, but this too is a great error. The National Defense State is precisely where genuine and splendid cultural creation begins. Originally, in order to create culture, one needs the leisure of time for contemplation (査考) or research (硏究). To obtain such leisure time, the stability of national life is the prerequisite (先決問題). However, in today's world which has reached a dead end, to stabilize national life, one must assert the correct national will in diplomacy to prevent war, or, should war occur, one must possess a great national defense capability to ensure victory. Why is this so? Because if one is defeated in diplomacy and pushed into unreasonable difficulties, or defeated in war and the people fall into an increasingly slave-like condition (奴隷的境遇), and their lives become unstable, then the creation and development of culture, etc., becomes impossible. That is, the prerequisite for the creation and development of culture lies in the stability of national life, and the stability of national life is preceded by the condition of stability in national defense. To fulfill these conditions, it must absolutely be a National Defense State. That is, the National Defense State does not fail to coexist with the creation and development of culture; rather, it is inextricably linked to the creation and development of culture.\nIt's an old story, but Ancient Greece (古代希臘) was a kind of National Defense State. In that era, the development of culture had not reached today's level, and consequently, means of transportation were also underdeveloped, and the exchange of world culture and economy was limited to a certain scope, so the globe had not become a single world. That is, there was one world centered around the Aegean Sea in the Greek region, and separate worlds existed in the East or other areas. However, around Greece, with the development of culture, the population increased, and due to factors like ethnic contact <155> and migration, the situation became very tense, leading to the emergence of National Defense States corresponding to the culture and forms of warfare of that time. These were the National Defense States of Athens (아덴) and Sparta (스팔타). Under such National Defense States, truly splendid ancient culture was built. Today, National Defense States capable of responding to the most advanced modern culture and forms of warfare are being built, and I am convinced that in the future, correct and splendid culture will be created upon the National Defense States of Japan (日本), Germany (獨逸), Italy (伊太利), etc.\nOriginally, the idea that considers culture as something above the state is called Culture-Supremacism (文化至上主義) or Humanism (人文主義). Holding such thoughts leads to the erroneous idea that the state is merely a method or means for creating culture, and that culture remains even if the state perishes. Dangerous ideas like the Social Contract Theory (國家契約說) also arise from this. Although it is said that culture remains even if the state is destroyed, in reality, culture only remains if the people who inherit that culture exist. It is said that a splendid culture existed on the American continent (亞米利加大陸) long ago, but because the people who inherited that culture disappeared, now one can only glimpse the ruins. Culture is not supreme; the state is supreme. The state is fundamental, and culture is created through the activities of that state and that people. Therefore, the idea that considers culture to be above the state is fundamentally mistaken. <156>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis article by Japanese Army Colonel Suzuki Kōzō argues forcefully for the necessity and permanence of the \"National Defense State\" (國防國家) in 1941. He refutes the ideas that this system is temporary, incompatible with true freedom (which he defines as collective and aligned with state goals, not individualistic), or detrimental to cultural development. Instead, he posits that the National Defense State is essential for national survival in an era of total war (including ideological and economic warfare), provides the stability necessary for genuine cultural creation, and represents a higher form of social organization where the state, not culture, is supreme. The article is historically significant as a clear example of Japanese wartime propaganda aimed at legitimizing totalitarian control and mobilizing the populace (including colonial subjects in Korea)

個人主義며, 自由主義며 民主主義를 謳歌하게되는 時代에 돌아가지 않을까 하는 錯覺을 가지고 있는 者가 있다. 어쨌든 西洋思想의 影響을 받은지 七十年이나 되므로 이 그릇된 思想에 中毒되여 病■盲에 達한 者가 적지않기 때문에 갑자기 百八十度轉換을 시켜서 새로운 體制를 쌓으려면 非常한 摩擦을 感하게된다. 이와같은 사람들은 實로 新體制와 國防國家를 變態的이오 一時的인 것으로 보는것이다. 그러나 現代와같이니 世界가 막다른 골목에 들어서서 戰爭이 進化하고 武力戰에서 總力戰으로 바뀌여오면, 具體的인 武力戰이 行해지고 있는때는 물론, 이것이 行해지지 않는때도 눈에 보이지않는 思想戰과 外交戰과 經濟戰이 恒常 行해지고 있게되는것이다. 눈에 보이지않는 이런싸움에도 언제든지 敗하지않도록 하지않으면 國家의 存立과 國民生活의 安定과 文化의 發展이 있을수 없으며, 그때문의 國防國家요 그 때문에 新體制라고 하면 決코 支那事變이 끝났다고해서 갑자기 解消할것은 아니다. 또 國防國家를 建設함에는 思想의 根底로부터 變케해서 이것을 法律이며 制度며 風俗이며 習慣에 實現하여 가는것이기 때문에 武力戰이 끝났다고 해서 갑＜152＞자기 前 體制에 돌아갈것은 아니다. 그리고 한번 進化한 戰爭은 文化의 發達과 함께 다시 進化하긴해도 退化되지는 않는다. 그러한 戰爭에 應하는 國家의 國防體制가 國防國家라고 하면 지금까지 國防國家가 아니였던것이 오히려 잘못이다. 따라서 國防國家를 建設함에 있어서 五十年, 百年, 數百年의 將來를 내여다 보아야한다. 우리들 一生一代는 勿論, 멀리 子子孫孫에게까지 미치는것이다. 無論 하루 신으면 구멍 뚫어지는「스푸」양말이라든가, 切符制度로 쌀이나 炭의 配合을 받는것 等의 것은 武力戰이 끝나면 그前대로 돌아갈것이지만 度義國防의 一切의 要素를 들어서의 一元的인 組織, 統制, 運營에 依해서 사람과 物資와 文化의 最大限의 綜合力을 國家目的에 묵거나 쓰는 體制는 어디까지든지 계속될것으로 생각하지 않아서는 안된다.\n\n二, 國防國家와 自由\n\n다음의 誤解는 國防國家의 生活과 自由가 兩立되지 않으리라는 그릇된 見解다. 從來의 個人主義와 自由主義가 民主主義의 思想에 비끄러 매워있던 사람들은 國防國家와 自由가 兩立되지 않는듯이 생각하지만 이것은 매우 그릇 된생각이며, 眞正한 意味의 自由와 國防國家는 훌륭히 兩立되는것이다. 自由主義라고 말하드래도 여러 가지의 自由가 있다. 道德上으로도 自由라는것이 있고, 心理學上으로도 自由라는것이 있고, 法律上으로도 自由라는것이있다. 道德上의 自由라고하는것은 自由의 바른 本心을 自主的으로 實現하여 가는것이기 때문에 國＜153＞防國家의 生活과 이 自由는 훌륭히 兩立된다. 心理的으로는 國防國家이든지 아니든지간에 實은 人間에게는 그 自由는 없다고 한다. 그렇다면 世上에 國防國家와 自由가 兩立되지 않는다는것을 부르짖는 사람들은 아마 法律的인 自由를 생각하고 있지않는가 생각된다. 法律的인 自由라고 하는것은 實은「許해진 意味의 自由」다. 말을 바꾸어 말한다면 法律에 依해서 保證되고 法律에 依해서 許해저있는 自由, 例컨대 日本臣民은 法律의 範圍內에서 信仰의 自由를 가진다든가, 或은 住民移轉의 自由를 가진다든가, 言論, 結社, 出版의 自由를 가진다든가, 或은 商法의 範圍에 있어서 自由롭게 物件의 取引이 된다고 하는 意味의 自由다. 이러한 自由와 國防國家가 兩立하는가는 問題에 對해서는 헛되이 觀念의 遊戱를 하여도 할수없으므로 大體 自由, 不自由의 實質內容은 무엇인가를 確實히 붓잡아서 생각함이 必要하다. 나는 그 實質內容을 다음과같이 생각한다.\n卽, 그것은 從來로부터 있는 法律, 制度, 風俗, 習慣과 一致한것이 自由요, 一致하지 않은것이 不自由라고 생각한다. 그런데, 世上의 法律, 制度, 風俗, 習慣은 어느틈엔가 그 社會에 生活하는 사람에게 收取되여 個人個人의 習慣이 되는것이다. 따라서 個人의 從來의 習慣과 一致하는것이 自由요, 一致하지 않는것이 不自由라 함이 된다. 例를 든다면 過去에 있어서는 돈이 있는대로 어떠한 노릇을 한다해도, 或은 著侈한 衣服을 사서입고, 自家用自動車를 사들여서 마음대로 깨소령을 使用하면서 散策이나 劇場에 自動車를 달리며 놀아도 일없었다. 그러나 國防國家가 되면서 資金의 統制, 物品의 統制가 되고본즉 그러한 虛榮은 許容될수없게된다. 이 때문에 過去에 虛榮의 習慣을 가졌던 者들은 極히 不自由롭게 된다. 또 過去에 있어서는 겨우 千米突의 距離에도 學校로부터 發明書를 얻어 割引乘車券을 사서 乘車하여 通學한 學生이 지금와서는 二千米突以內에는 乘車하지 못하게 되었으므로 처음엔 極히 不自由로웠을것이다. 또 料理店에 가서 一人分 二十圓乃至三十圓따리로 놀던것이 지금 와서는 點心이 最高二圓五十錢夕飯이 最高五圓이 되고본즉 매우 不足하여 不滿을 느끼리라. 그렇지만 이런 不自由도 結局 慣習이기 때문에 眞實된 生活의 慣習을 기르면 不自由를 느기지않을 것이다. 말하자면 自由, 不自由라는 問題가없을것이다.\n從來 國防國家가 되지않었던 時代에는 理不盡한 勢力 때문에 妨害되여 國家를 爲한 眞正한 意志도 實現되지않은 때가 적지않았다. 그러나 國防國家가 되면 國家目的에 合하고 公益에 合하는 바른 意志는 얼마든지 實現될수 있는것이다. 卽 積極的인 眞正한 自由의 領域이 퍼질것이다. 이와같이 생각하면 모든＜154＞角度에서 보아서 國防國家와 自由는 훌륭히 兩立된다. 이것을 兩立되지않는다고 생각하는것은 그릇된 意味의 自由思想에 부잡힌 까닭이다.\n\n三, 國防國家와 文化\n\n다음의 誤解는 國防國家와 文化의 創造發展이 兩立되지않는다는 생각이다. 自由主義와 世界主義의 文人들은 좀 어쩌면 國防國家와 文化의 創造發展이 兩立되지 않는듯이 생각하나, 이것도 또한 큰 잘못이다. 國防國家야말로 비로소 眞正하고 훌륭한 文化의 創造인것이다. 元來, 文化를 創造하기 爲해서는 査考한다든가 硏究한다든가 하는 時間의 餘裕가 없으면 안된다. 그러한 時間의 餘裕를 얻기 爲해서는 于先 國民生活의 安定이라는것이 先決問題인것이다. 그러나 오늘날같이 世界가 막다른 골목에 이르러있는 속에서 國民生活을 安定시키려면 外交에 있어서는 바른 國家意志를 通하여서 戰爭을 防止할것이나 萬一 戰爭케 되는때인 반드시 이겨야하는 偉大한 國防力을 가지지 않아서는 안된다. 웨그런고하니 外交에 敗하여서 無理難題에 밀리우고 또 戰爭에 敗하여서 그 民族의 점점 더 奴隷的境遇에 빠지고 그 生活이 安定되지 못한다고하면 文化의 創造發展等은 말못되게 되는것이다. 卽 文化의 創造發展의 先決條件은 國民生活의 安定이라는데 있으며 國民生活의 安定에는 다시 國防이 安定이라는 條件이 앞선다. 이들 條件을 채우는데는 어떻게 해서든지 國防國家가 아니고는 안된다. 卽, 國防國家는 文化의 創造發展과 兩立되지않음이 아니라 도리어 文化의 創造發展과 不可分의 關係에있다.\n오랜 이야기지만 古代希臘은 一種의 國防國家였었다. 그 時代에는 文化의 發達이 今日의 程度에 達해있지 못했으므로 따라서 交通機關도 發達되지 못했고 世界文化의 交流며 經濟의 交流가 어떤 範圍에 限해있었으므로 地球가 한 개의 世界로 되지못했던 것이다. 卽, 에-게海附近을 中心으로한 希臘一帶의 地에 한 世界가 있었고 東洋에도 或은 其他方面에도 떨어진 世界가 있었다. 그런데 希臘附近은 文化의 發達과 함께 人口가 增殖하고 또 民族의 接＜155＞觸移動等의 關係上 매우 緊迫한 情勢가 되었으므로 그 時代의 文化며 戰爭의 形體에 應할만한 國防國家가 나타났던것이다. 그것이「아덴」과「스팔타」의 國防國家였었다. 그러한 國防國家밑에서 實로 훌륭한 代腦文化가 建設되였었다. 今日에는 가장 進步한 近希文化와 戰爭形體에 應할수있는 國防國家가 建設되여 있는데 將來 日本, 獨逸, 伊太利等의 國防國家우에 바른 훌륭한 文化가 만들어지리라고 나는 確信한다.\n元來 文化를 國家以上의것이라는듯이 생각하는 思想은 文化至上主義乃至 人文主義의 思想이라고 한다. 그러한 思想을 가지면 國家는 文化를 創造해내기 爲한 方法手段이 되고, 國家는 亡해도 文化는 남는다는 그릇된 思想이 되고만다. 또 國家契約說等이라고 하는 危陰한 思想도 생기게된다. 國家는 滅亡해도 文化는 남는다고 말하지만 其實은 그 文化를 繼承할 民族이 있고야 비로소 文化가 남게되는것이다. 옛날 亞米利加大陸에는 훌륭한 文化가 있었다고 하는데, 그 文化를 繼承할 民族이 없어졌기 때문에 지금은 單只 廢墟를 엿볼 따름이다. 文化가 至上의것이 아니라 國家가 至上의것이다. 國家가 本來的인것이오 文化는 그 國家 그 民族의 活動에 依해서 創造되는것이다. 따라서 文化를 國家以上의것으로 생각하는 思想은 根本으로부터 잘못이다.＜156＞\n＜152-156＞","magazine":"삼천리 제13권 제9호","date":"1941년 09월 01일","title":"Freedom of Culture and the National Defense State - Arguing Against the Fallacy of

When Appetite is Poor\nBy Okabe Taku, Doctor of Medicine\n\nAn Infectious Disease That Doesn't Feel Painful\n\nTuberculosis (結核), commonly called the \"deficiency disease\" (不足病) or \"lung disease\" (肺病), usually follows a chronic course compared to other infectious diseases.\nThat is, tuberculosis is an infectious disease where one doesn't suddenly feel sick. In the early stages of the illness, most people cannot perceive symptoms that would make them feel like they have contracted a serious disease.\nTherefore, among tuberculosis researchers, it is common knowledge to consider it acute tuberculosis only when clear medical symptoms are present. Whether symptoms that could be believed to indicate recovery after treatment appear or not, medically, there is no difference.\nGenerally, even malignant tuberculosis initially presents latently without surface signs (陰性), so in the majority of cases, there are no definite signs prompting a visit to the doctor until the disease has progressed significantly. Thus, there are many instances where people continue to work as usual.\nSince tuberculosis often progresses simply as a state of poor appetite or gastrointestinal disturbance, the need for early treatment of tuberculosis goes without saying, yet its early detection is quite difficult.\n\nFatigue, Decreased Appetite\n\nListing some symptoms that might suggest tuberculosis, especially early ones that one might vaguely recognize but not consider serious: if you find yourself less patient than usual for no particular reason, get tired more easily than others, or run a slight fever when slightly overworked even though you usually feel fine, you need to consider the possibility. Others who should be quite cautious are those experiencing, without any clear reason, some or all of the following symptoms: general malaise, a hoarse voice every morning, a persistent cough that doesn't easily subside, feeling vaguely unwell and irritable, nervousness, night sweats (盜汗), and weight loss.\nIf you feel fine in the morning but your head feels heavy in the evening, and you consistently run a slight fever of around 37.2 or 37.3 degrees Celsius, or if along with that, ■■ [text illegible/missing] or phlegm appears, it often indicates that even in the early stages, the disease has progressed considerably. If hemoptysis (咯血 - coughing up blood) occurs, it definitively means tuberculosis has progressed significantly. Therefore, it is imperative to detect it as early as possible before that point and prevent the disease's progression.<158>\nWhile it's true for any illness that the earlier the treatment, the better the course and the faster the cure, tuberculosis, in particular, is easier to cure the earlier it is treated. Just as it's said that one day's delay in recuperation leads to a month's delay in recovery, if this early treatment method is thoroughly followed, treating tuberculosis is by no means difficult.\n\nPathogen Treatment Method\n\nThe slight fever, night sweats, loss of appetite, and gastrointestinal disturbances that tuberculosis patients suffer from day and night (晝夜) are caused by the action of tuberculosis bacterial toxins. Although the tuberculosis bacterium mainly attaches to the lungs and does not directly stimulate the heat center, sweat center, or gastrointestinal tract, it continuously secretes a type of toxin. When this toxin acts on the vagus nerve (迷途神經), it causes loss of appetite. When it acts on the gastric mucosa, gastric juice secretion decreases, impairing the overall digestive function of the gastrointestinal tract and making nutrient absorption difficult.\nBecause of this, the patient's nutrition declines, and the whole body gradually becomes emaciated and weakened.\nTherefore, in treating tuberculosis, one must first eliminate the loss of appetite and gastrointestinal disturbances that worsen the nutritional state. However, since these are phenomena caused by the tuberculosis bacterial toxin, simple digestive aids or appetite stimulants have the regrettable limitation that their effect disappears when the medication wears off, failing to address the root cause of the symptoms. But \"Wakamoto\" (와까모도), a complex medicinal yeast preparation and the only one of its kind in our country (我國), is different from simple gastrointestinal medicines. It fundamentally eliminates the patient's loss of appetite and gastrointestinal disorders while simultaneously supplying abundant nutrition and increasing the phagocytic action (喰菌作用) of white blood cells, weakening the activity of the tuberculosis bacteria. Thus, it is most ideal as a tuberculosis treatment agent.\n\nWhy Does \"Wakamoto\" Work Well?\n\nThat is, \"Wakamoto\" exhibits a special action called cell protoplasm activation (細胞原形質賦治作用) through the combined effect of vitamin B complex, which it contains in the highest amount among natural substances and has the highest utilization rate in the human body, and three digestive enzymes (starch-digesting enzyme, protein-digesting enzyme, fat-digesting enzyme). It first aims to strengthen the gastrointestinal tract, invigorates gastrointestinal functions such as digestion, nutrient absorption, and stool elimination (排池), thus securing the primary line of nutrition.\nFurthermore, it supplements protein, calcium, glycogen (구리고-젠), fats, etc., which are often deficient in patients, thereby enriching nutrition and invigorating overall life functions. On the other hand, it also contains components such as flavin (후라빈) which neutralizes tuberculosis bacterial toxins, nuclease(?) (누구레닌) which increases white blood cells and enhances phagocytosis, lipase (리빠-제) which dissolves the capsule of the tuberculosis bacterium, and \"kurikokinin\"(?) (구리고기닌) which even has the nickname \"appetite element\" (食慾素). By enhancing natural healing power and strengthening resistance to disease, the condition gradually improves, and healing is promoted. Therefore, it can be said to be the most suitable medicine for the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis.\n\"Wakamoto\" is sold cheaply at 1 Won 60 Chŏn for a 25-day supply and 5 Won for an 83-day supply (sold at regulated prices depending on the region). It is distributed throughout Korea (全鮮) from the Wakamoto Honpo Chōsen Eigyōsho (와까모도 本舖朝鮮營業所) at 195 Yŏngŏn-chŏng, Kyŏngsŏng-bu (京城府蓮建町一九五番地) (Postal Transfer Kyŏngsŏng 10738). For regional orders, shipping costs are covered (送料負擔), and express delivery is provided. It is also available at pharmacies throughout Korea (全鮮各藥店).<159>\n<158-159>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe article, written by Dr. Okabe Taku, describes the subtle early symptoms of tuberculosis (TB), such as fatigue, low fever, poor appetite, and irritability, emphasizing that TB often develops unnoticed until it's advanced. It stresses the critical importance of early detection and treatment. The latter half explains that TB toxins cause symptoms like poor appetite and digestive issues, hindering nutrition. It then heavily promotes \"Wakamoto,\" a yeast-based supplement, claiming it uniquely addresses the root cause by improving digestion, supplying nutrients (vitamins, enzymes, protein, etc.), and boosting the immune system (increasing white blood cells, containing toxin neutralizers) to fight TB bacteria, thereby promoting natural healing.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, the article is interesting as it reflects medical understanding and public health concerns about TB (a major killer) in colonial Korea during WWII. It notably features a Japanese doctor providing health advice to a Korean audience. Most revealing is the seamless integration of an advertisement for a Japanese product, \"Wakamoto,\" presenting it not just as a supplement but almost as a specific treatment for TB, highlighting commercial interests intertwined with public health messaging in the colonial era.

Having no choice, although it was his regular day off, Mr. Chu drove wherever the young lady wanted to go. Mr. Chu had received a letter saying a friend from Chosŏn (朝鮮) was arriving that day and was planning to go to the train station. Thinking he should quickly drop her off and head to the station, he drove at maximum speed. The young lady thought the driver was speeding out of anger because he couldn't rest, and said,\n\"Hey, isn't it dangerous to speed like this? What if we have an accident? Oh my, I'm getting dizzy!\"\n\"If you're dizzy, close your eyes like me.\"\nHearing this, the impatient young lady, wondering if he was really driving with his eyes closed, craned her neck over his shoulder to look at Mr. Chu at the steering wheel. Indeed, his eyes were closed. The car was speeding like an arrow, and she got scared.\n\"Hey, stop it! Who drives with their eyes closed, not caring if they die? Gosh, there's no one as stubborn (지독한 놈) as an Oriental. How annoying.\"\nMuttering this, she hailed another taxi and left. At that moment, Mr. Chu wasn't actually driving with his eyes closed. As everyone knows, when Mr. Chu laughs, his eyes become slits as if closed. He had laughed because he found it funny that this impatient young lady was peering over his shoulder.\nMr. Chu went straight to the train station to meet his friend. Seeing Mr. Chu driving a private car, the friend remarked, \"America really has so many cars, even a poor student like you drives a private car.\"\n\nMr. Chŏng Insŏp, Good at Giving Pen Names\n\nOnce, Mr. Ko Changhwan (高長煥氏), who wrote many children's stories and was passionate about the youth movement, went to Mr. Chŏng Insŏp (鄭寅燮氏) and asked him to give him a pen name. Mr. Chŏng Insŏp thought for a moment and said,\n\"Your pen name should be Kŏnwi (健胃).\" \"Kŏnwi? What does Kŏnwi mean?\" \"Kŏnwi means a strong stomach (胃). Isn't your name Ko Changhwan?<160>\nKŏnwi is perfect for Ko Changhwan. That way, it becomes 'Kŏnwi Ko Changhwan' (健胃固腸丸 - a pun on a patent medicine name meaning 'Stomach-Strengthening, Intestine-Solidifying Pill').\"\n\nThe Female Writer, Ch'uho Chŏn Yŏngt'aek\n\nDuring the early days of the Chosŏn New Literary Movement, in the era of the pure literary magazine \"Creation\" (創造), which he co-led with Mr. Kim Tongin (金東仁氏), the three creators Ch'unwŏn (春園), Kim Tongin, and Chŏn Yŏngt'aek (田榮澤) emerged together like the three legs of a tripod. At that time, Mr. Ch'uho Chŏn Yŏngt'aek (秋湖 田榮澤氏), who was studying in the Theology Department at Aoyama Gakuin (靑山學院), published the short story \"Spring of Life\" (生命의봄) in \"Creation\" magazine.\nThe story is about a young man who finishes his theology studies in Tokyo, returns to become a pastor, and marries a woman from P'yŏngyang (平壤). The morning after the wedding ceremony, the groom goes to visit the bride in prison, where she is serving time for something that happened during her maiden days. This story is said to be based on the author's own real-life experience.\nHowever, several years ago, this magazine published a short story by Mr. Ch'uho Chŏn Yŏngt'aek titled \"Are Women Human Too?\" (女子도 사람인가).\nImmediately after this piece was published, the critic Im Hwa (林和氏), who wrote the \"History of New Chosŏn Literature\" (朝鮮新文學史), reviewed the story in the Arts section critique column of the Tonga Ilbo (東亞日報) newspaper, saying,\n\"I wonder which female writer (閨秀作家) the author of this novel, Ch'uho, might be.\"\n\nThe Hidden Struggles of Magazine Editing\n\nDuring the era of Kaebyŏk Publishing Company (開闢社), which was once famous for its magazines, Mr. Ch'a Sangch'an (車相瓚氏), who was the chief editor at the time, was determined to publish an article by the now-deceased Mr. Mun Ilp'yŏng (文一平氏) in Kaebyŏk magazine. It is said that he visited Mr. Mun thirty-six times to personally collect the manuscript.\n\nCh'unwŏn and the Literary Youth\n\nOne day, Ch'unwŏn received a lengthy manuscript along with a letter from an unknown literary youth. The letter went something like this:\n\"I humbly hope that your esteemed health is ever excellent, with utmost sincerity. Thanks to your benevolent care, this humble student is well, so please rest assured. Humbly informing you, I have recently written a lengthy novel to submit to the ×× Newspaper's prize competition for long-form novels. I earnestly beseech you, Teacher, to honor it with your perusal (拜讀), and if there are any faults, please correct them so that it may win first prize.\"\nUpon receiving this letter, Ch'unwŏn, wondering how old the sender was to ask him to \"peruse\" (拜讀) it, lost the inclination to \"peruse\" it and reportedly sent it directly to the newspaper company as it was.\n\nThe Origin of Mr. Yun Sŏkchung's Pen Name\n\nThe children's story writer Mr. Yun Sŏkchung (尹石重氏) once published a children's story in a newspaper. At that time, a printing worker mistakenly set the character 'Chung' (重) as 'Tong' (童) for Sŏkchung. Thus, the children's rhyme was published under the name Yun Sŏktong (尹石童). Ch'unwŏn, who saw this rhyme and knew it was by Mr. Yun Sŏkchung, later met Mr. Yun and said, \"You've chosen a good pen name (雅號).\" From then on, he was simply called Sŏktong. <161>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis article compiles several anecdotes about prominent Korean literary figures from the colonial period. It includes stories about novelist Chu Yosŏp's time as a chauffeur in the US, how Chŏng Insŏp humorously gave Ko Changhwan a pen name based on a pun, a case of mistaken gender identity regarding writer Chŏn Yŏngt'aek by critic Im Hwa, the persistence of editor Ch'a Sangch'an in getting a manuscript from Mun Ilp'yŏng, Yi Kwangsu's (Ch'unwŏn) reaction to an overly formal young writer, and the accidental origin of Yun Sŏkchung's pen name \"Sŏktong\". For historians, the article offers glimpses into the personal lives, interactions, and working conditions of Korean intellectuals under Japanese rule, including experiences abroad (Chu Yosŏp in the US), the dynamics within the literary community (pen names, critiques, editing struggles), and the blending of traditional formality with modern aspirations.

In particular, Mr. Pak Kŏ-yŏng, the general secretary of the Shanghai Theater Arts Research Society, has come to Kyŏngsŏng from Shanghai and is active in working towards cooperation between Korean cultural organizations in Shanghai and the various cultural organizations in Korea. By exchanging opinions from both sides regarding this cooperation, we aim to plan for the advancement of Korean culture onto the Mainland, etc. If, through these activities among our cultural sectors, we can provide even a small amount of help towards the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere (大東亞共榮團), which is our nation's highest goal, this surely cannot but be our shared great excitement. First, I would like to introduce Mr. Pak Kŏ-yŏng to everyone and proceed with this meeting.\n\nPak Kŏ-yŏng: Thank you ever so much for attending despite your very busy schedules. As Mr. Kim Tong-hwan just mentioned, there are 8,000 compatriots from the Peninsula residing in Shanghai. Since the Incident (事變), even the ideologues have all changed their direction (轉向). In the business world too, they show great skill, and the foundation for Koreans has grown, holding a position comparable to foreigners. Furthermore, although meager, there are cultural organizations formed by our own hands. I came to Kyŏngsŏng harboring various hopes about how we might shake hands (握手) and establish contact with the seniors within Korea, or receive guidance and assistance<162>. While our cultural organizations in Shanghai are not significant enough to make a big fuss about, they have shown very lively movement in the last year or two, and support from various quarters is quite substantial. Currently in Shanghai, there are various organizations formed by Koreans, such as newspaper companies, magazine companies, clubs (俱樂部), youth associations (靑年會), movie theaters (映畵館), kindergartens (幼稚園), the Theater Arts Research Society (劇藝術硏究會), etc. All operate along the lines of the current situation (時局) with the support of the military authorities (軍當局), the Consulate General (總領事館), and the authorities of the Government-General of Korea's Shanghai Branch (朝鮮總督府上海出張所), and we also desire contact with those within the homeland (海內). First, I would like to hear about the trends and current status of the various cultural organizations in Korea.\n\nKim Tong-hwan: Regarding the report on the current state of Korean culture, it would be good if you could start with the theater sector.\n\nAttendees\nShanghai Theater Arts Research Society Side: Pak Kŏ-yŏng (朴巨影)\n×\nKorean Film Artists Association Chairman: An Chong-hwa (安鍾和)\nKorean Theater Association Chairman: Yi Sŏ-gu (李瑞求)\nHyŏndae Theater Representative: Yu Ch'i-jin (柳致眞)\nNational Theater Research Institute Director: Ham Tae-hun (咸大勳)\nKorean Film Culture Research Institute Director: Yi Ch'ang-yong (李創用)\nDancer: Cho T'aek-wŏn (趙澤元)\nKorean Theater Association Director: Kim Kwan-su (金寬洙)\nKoryŏ Film Company Propaganda Department: Kim Yŏng-su (金永壽)\nKyŏngsŏng Ilbo Company Arts Department: Tanaka Hiroshi (田中宏)\nKyŏngsŏng Ilbo Company Arts Department: Suda Shizuo (須田靜夫)\nOur Company Side\nKim Tong-hwan (金東煥)\nPak Kye-ju (朴啓周)\nDate and Time: August 3rd, 6:00 PM\nPlace: Kyŏngsŏng Asadan Hall\n\nCurrent Status of the Theater Association\n\nYi Sŏ-gu: While there have traditionally been many theater groups in Korea, because there was no control organization (統制機關), they acted freely. Also, in terms of organization and performance scripts, they were situated in liberal tendencies, so it is an undeniable fact that there were many unsound theatrical activities. To control and strengthen this and respond immediately to the New Order (新體制), meaning to further solidify national consciousness through theater and plan for the improvement of national life (國民生活), the Theater Association was founded last December. At the time of founding, only nine troupes were recognized, but currently, twenty-two troupes are taking sound steps under the recognition of the authorities (當局) and this Association.<163> In particular, the Hyŏndae Theater (現代劇場) is undertaking sound and timely theatrical actions called National Drama (國民劇), serving not only as a model (龜鑑) for the theater world but also establishing the National Theater Research Institute (國民演劇硏究所) specifically to improve the quality of performers, currently training sixty actors. Though extremely brief, what I have mentioned above roughly covers the steps our Association has taken over the past year.\n\nKim Tong-hwan: Next, could Mr. Yu Ch'i-jin speak about the performance of \"Hŭngnyonggang\" (黑龍江, Black Dragon River), the National Drama championed by the Hyŏndae Theater?\n\nYu Ch'i-jin: Since \"Hŭngnyonggang\" is a work I wrote myself, it's awkward for me to say much. However, I would like to say a few words regarding National Drama itself. National Drama has become the focus of society's attention in light of the current situation (現時局). In its content, artistic consciousness should not be lost, but at the same time, it must contribute to the promotion (發掦) of the national ideology (國家理念). However, this should be a natural development, reaching the great ideals of the nation step-by-step from the agony of human instinct – that is, a natural occurrence. Of course, National Drama must be grounded in the real (리알에 脚理하여 - grounded in reality?) and develop its ideology towards romanticism, but I think there are two directions in its method. The first is a fantastical, Oriental painting-like technique (東洋畵的手法) that mainly expresses the beauty of curves with fine, delicate lines. The second is the opposite: thick, straight lines, like Western painting (西洋畵的). \"Hŭngnyonggang\" chose the latter, handling the simple and rational as real (리알한것에 取扱하여 - treated as realistic?), attempting to develop the dynamic realism (迫眞力) of the continental spirit (大陸氣質) towards romanticism. Of course, the romanticism mentioned here does not refer to flat nostalgia but points to the sublimation (昇華) of boiling ideology. What I've described above is the theatrical action of our Hyŏndae Theater.\n\nRegarding the Mobile Theater Troupe\n\nKim Tong-hwan: This time, it would be appreciated if Mr. Kim Kwan-su could speak about the \"Mobile Theater Troupe\" (移動劇團) newly organized within the Theater Association.\n\nKim Kwan-su: The Mobile Theater Troupe aims to provide sound and cheerful theater to laborers in farming villages, mining areas, fishing villages, etc., who receive absolutely no cultural benefits (惠澤), thereby giving them comfort (慰安) and consequently encouraging production expansion (生産擴充) by having them engage in work effort (動勞) with gratitude for labor (勤勞) or in a bright mood (明朗한 氣分). It also aims to establish local culture, foster patriotic thought (愛國思想), and ensure thorough understanding of the current situation (時局認識), among other things. We first recruited members, selecting eleven men and five women from over sixty applicants. Furthermore, there was a month-long training session (講習會) from June 25th, and currently, they are in intense practice every afternoon. After holding a trial performance (試演會)<164> and send-off party (壯行會) on August 10th, they plan to begin touring, starting with Kyŏnggi Province (京畿道) from August 15th. We intended to make admission free (無料), but due to severe operational difficulties (困難), if the mine operators bear the cost, the laborers will be able to watch for free. Otherwise, we plan to keep the price as low as possible (最廉價).\n\nOverview of the National Theater Research Institute\n\nKim Tong-hwan: Now, could Mr. Ham Tae-hun speak about the current status of the National Theater Research Institute (國民演劇硏究所)?\n\nHam Tae-hun: The National Theater Research Institute is a sister organization (姉妹團體) to the Hyŏndae Theater, primarily focused on training actors (俳優養成) and improving actor quality. It opened (開講) on May 15th, and the first term of study (第一期修業) lasts until August 15th. Instructors (講師) include authorities from the military, government, and civilian sectors (軍官民), especially mobilizing authorities from academia (學界) and artists holding leadership positions in various fields. Out of one hundred eighty-four applicants (應募者), only sixty were selected (選拔) and admitted as first-term research students (第一期硏究生). The subjects taught (敎授科目) are National Language (國語), National History (國史), World Affairs (世界情勢), General Arts (藝術全般), Acting and Directing Techniques (俳優術演出術), Drama (戱曲), Stage (舞臺), Art (美術), Music (音樂), Dance (舞踊), etc.\n\nCurrent Status of the Film Association\n\nKim Tong-hwan: Next, could Mr. An Chong-hwa speak about the Film Association (映畵協會)?\n\nAn Chong-hwa: Korean film has a long history of twenty years, but the Association was founded just last October. Currently, there are ten film production companies (映畵製作所), including Chosŏn Film Co., Ltd. (朝鮮映畵株式會社) and Koryŏ Film Company (高麗映畵社). Last year, according to the authorities' Film Ordinance (映畵令), the Filmmaker Technician Registration System (映畵人技術者登錄制) was implemented. Sixteen technicians were registered in the first phase (第一期) and twenty [typo in original, should likely be sixty to reach eighty total?] in the second phase (第二期), for a total of eighty technicians (技術者) registered. \"Technician\" is a general term (總稱) covering directors (監督/演出者), cinematographers (撮影者), actors (男女俳優), etc. Those not registered have absolutely no qualification (關聯資格) to be involved in film production. Next, regarding film culture (映畵文化), Mr. Yi Ch'ang-yong will speak separately, so I'll omit it. However, recently, the issue of merging the various film companies (映畵會社合同問題) has been actively discussed and has become the focus of public attention (注視), but its realization (實現) has not yet been seen. I believe a good resolution (解決) will be found under the banner (旗帳) of the New Order in the future.\n\nTrends in the Korean Film World\n\nKim Tong-hwan: Could Mr. Yi Ch'ang-yong speak about film production and distribution (配給)?\n\nYi Ch'ang-yong: Unlike the theater world, the Film Association does not yet have an institution for training the next generation (第二世養成機關), and it seems there is more time spent resting (休息) than actively working, so the results (成果) present an extremely meager (微微) appearance. In fact, even though there are ten film companies in Korea, the number of films produced (製作本數) per year is merely five or six, and in a year like this one, we haven't even seen three or four productions, showing no discernible progress (進步).<165> One reason for this, from the perspective of entrepreneurs (企業家), is largely related to the Film Company Merger Issue (映畵會社合同問題). From the capitalists' (資本家) side, they are in a state of suspended operation (休業狀態) based on the view that they will wait to see the future outcome (今後歸趨) of the merger movement based on the control of film businesses (映畵業者統制), which is currently becoming a major issue – that is, if a merger happens, there is no need to invest huge sums (巨額) to produce films. Of course, the authorities proposed the merger issue for the sake of better development and improvement of the Korean film world, and therefore to foster it based on the national ideology (國家理念), so we must cooperate and strive (協力邁進) towards that goal (目的). In the Mainland (內地 - Japan), Shochiku (松竹) alone encompasses over a thousand filmmakers, and throughout Japan, an astonishing number of filmmakers are leaving enormous legacies. However, in Korea, with merely eighty people, being in such a completely meager state prompts us to self-reflect (再反省). Regarding distribution (配給), we are reaching out to the Mainland (內地 - Japan), Manchuria (滿洲), and even North China (北至), but distribution to the Shanghai area has not happened yet.\n\nPerformance of National Dance\n\nKim Tong-hwan: Next, could Mr. Cho T'aek-wŏn speak about dance (舞踊)?\n\nCho T'aek-wŏn: Compared to other arts organizations, our dancers are few in number (數爻), so our activities (活動) are also very meager (微微). Mr. Han Sŏng-jun (韓成俊), a pioneer (先驅者) and elder (元老) of the Korean dance world, received the Culture Prize (文化賞) several months ago. Ms. Ch'oe Sŭng-hŭi (崔承喜) returned from her tour of Europe and America (歐米行脚) and held homecoming performances. And, what could be called a first (嚆矢) in Korea, a National Dance performance sponsored by the Korean Performing Arts Association (朝鮮演藝協會) featured myself and Japanese women (內地女子) from the Ishii (石井) Dance Institute. This was \"Puyŏ Recollections\" (夫餘回想曲), themed on the historical fact (史實) of Japan-Korea Unity (內鮮一體). It was performed in Kyŏngsŏng and Taegu (大邱), achieving great results.\n\nTrends of Korean Cultural Organizations in Shanghai\n\nKim Tong-hwan: Next, let's hear a report from Mr. Pak Kŏ-yŏng about the various cultural organizations in Shanghai.\n\nPak Kŏ-yŏng: Shanghai may have a big name, but the scope of our cultural activities belongs to an extremely rudimentary (幼稚) level. It's quite surprising that the Chinese-language daily newspaper (華文版 日刊新聞) \"Shanghai Times\" (上海時報社), with Mr. Kim Kyŏng-chae (金璟載) as Vice President (社長은 無 - no president) and 500,000 won fully paid-in capital (五十萬圓全額拂込), is managed entirely by our Korean hands. The executives (幹部) like the Business Bureau Chief (營業局長) and Editorial Bureau Chief (編輯局長) are all Korean. As for Korean-language magazines (朝鮮文雜誌), the monthly \"Kwanghwa\" (光化), previously published under the direction (主宰下) of Mr. Yi Kap-nyŏng (李甲寧), had been suspended (休刊), but this time Mr. Kim Kyŏng-chae took over (引繼) the Kwanghwa Company (光化社) and will resume publication (續刊) with considerable funds (基金). As you know, there are no Korean movable type characters (朝鮮文活字) in Shanghai, so we purchased all the type (文活)<166> from the former Chōsen Chūō Nippō Company (前朝鮮中央日報社) and brought it to Shanghai. Besides that, Mr. Kim Kyŏng-chae invested 450,000 dollars (四十五萬딸라) to purchase (買收) the Willis Grand Theater (우이리스 大戱院), previously managed by foreigners. So, a three-story Western-style movie theater (映畵館) is also proudly competing shoulder-to-shoulder (어깨를 겨루고) with foreigners in the international city (國際都市) of Shanghai, managed by our hands. Other than these, there is our \"Shanghai Theater Arts Research Society\" (上海劇藝術硏究會), the \"Shanghai Kyelim Club\" (上海鷄林俱樂部) organized by Shanghai Korean cultural figures, the \"Shanghai Kyelim Youth Group\" (上海鷄林靑年團), and also the \"Shanghai Yangjŏng Kindergarten\" (上海養正幼稚園) run by us.\n\nChinese Cultural Organizations in Shanghai\n\nYu Ch'i-jin: What Chinese cultural organizations are there?\n\nPak Kŏ-yŏng: There's the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association (中日文化協會), headquartered (本部) in Nanking (南京). It was organized by figures like Wang Ching-wei (汪精衛), Chu Min-i (褚民誼), Lin Po-sheng (林伯生), former Ambassador Abe (阿部前大使), etc., based on the three great principles (三大原則) of Sino-Japanese cooperation (日支提携), good neighborly friendship (善隣友好), and joint defense against communism (共同防共). Film production companies include \"Yehwa Film Company\" (藝華影業公司) and \"Hsinhua Film Company\" (新華影業公司). Theater troupes include \"T'ienma\" (天馬), \"Chungkuo Lüxing\" (中國旅行), and \"T'ienfêng\" (天風). They show us performances with acting (演技) and artistic fragrance (藝術的芳香) that ripen beyond our imagination (想像); indeed, we saw that their standard (水準) was not inferior (遜色) compared to foreign countries. Besides these, on our country's side (我國側 - likely meaning Japanese), there are the Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun Company (上海每日新聞社), Tairiku Shinpō Company (大陸新報社), magazines like \"Tairiku Ōrai\" (大陸往來) and \"Yōsukō\" (楊子江), and other cultural organizations like Geibun Kai (藝文會), Chōkō Kai (長江會), Shanghai Kajin Sha (上海歌人社), Shanghai Shinpō (上海新報), Shinyū Hō (新由報).\n\nArtistic Exchange between Korea and the Mainland\n\nKim Tong-hwan: How can Korean theater, film, dance, literature, etc., be brought to the Mainland (大陸)? That is, I hope you will offer your candid (忌憚없으신) opinions on conveying the culture of the homeland (海內) to the Koreans on the Mainland to achieve mutual cultural exchange (彼此의 文化交流).\n\nPak Kŏ-yŏng: Koreans in Shanghai always long for news from the homeland, and it is their common hope (共通된 希望) to somehow encounter the films, theater, literature, and dance of the Peninsula. There have been proposals for exporting Korean films to Shanghai or inviting Korean theater troupes to Shanghai. I hope we can exchange opinions on that point.\n\nDifficulties of Theater Advancement\n\nYi Sŏ-gu: Last year, the Broadcasting Association (放送協會) organized a performing arts troupe (演藝團) (songs, dances, light drama, comic chat) and planned to tour places like Shanghai, Central China (中支), and North China (北支) to comfort (慰問) the Imperial Army (皇軍) and overseas compatriots. Of course, the goal was not profit (營利), and we intended to proceed even if it meant taking a loss (損). However, there was no one locally to act as a counterpart (相對), so it was cancelled (中止). For Shanghai only, Mr. Yi Kap-nyŏng (李甲寧) stepped forward at the time, offering to arrange everything and even bear the losses (損害) in Shanghai.<167> But that was only for Shanghai; for places like Hsüchow (徐州), Tsingtao (靑島), Tsinan (濟南), Tientsin (天津), and Peking (北京), no matter how much we thought about it, there was no one to step forward and make arrangements. Just going to Shanghai and back would involve enormous time and expense, so that wasn't feasible.\n\nKim Kwan-su: A few days ago, Mr. Pak Kŏ-yŏng also came to the Association and mentioned wanting to invite Korean theater troupes to Shanghai. Currently, various troupes within Korea go even to remote places in Manchuria like Tumen (圖們), Yenchi (延吉), Lungching (龍井), Mutanchiang (牡丹江), and even Chiamussu (佳木斯). This is because transportation is convenient, allowing them to sleep on the train during the day and perform at night without resting even a day in between, thus avoiding losses. However, traveling to and from Shanghai wastes (虛費) more than ten days in transit. Even in Shanghai, if all 8,000 Koreans were mobilized (總動員) and attended without exception, the income from three days would not even cover the travel expenses (旅費) for the troupe members. Other costs like prop transportation (道具運搬), food expenses (食費), general expenses (經費), and advertising costs (宣傳費) would show an enormous deficit (赤子), making it a very difficult matter. Furthermore, placing this burden (損) on the local compatriots contradicts (背馳) the spirit of comfort (慰問), so I think it might be entirely impossible (不可能).\n\nHam Tae-hun: Even so, if the goal isn't just Shanghai, but starting with a performance in Shanghai, then touring places like Hsüchow (徐州), Tsingtao (靑島), Kaifeng (開封), Tientsin (天津), and Peking (北京) on the way back, wouldn't the loss be less than just going to Shanghai and returning?\n\nYi Sŏ-gu: In any case (何如間), if there are counterparts (相對者) in Shanghai and all the places like Hsüchow, Tsingtao, Kaifeng, Tientsin, and Peking to make arrangements, I think there's no reason why theater couldn't go to the Mainland.\n\nThe Mission of Film for Mainland Export\n\nYi Ch'ang-yong: In the case of film, there's no need to dispatch actors (俳優派遣) or transport props (道具運搬); the problem is solved just by sending the film (■님 - likely 필름, film). Therefore, compared to theater, there's a notable difference (顯著한 差異), making the advancement of Korean film onto the Mainland, meaning local screenings (現地上映), very easy (容易). The issues are securing good mediation (幹旋) from the Shanghai film distribution control body, the China Film Company (中華映畵社), and also, unlike theater, film audiences are not limited (限해지는것이) to Koreans; Japanese (內地人) and foreigners (外國人) can also watch. Therefore, the only issue is whether we have confidence (自身) that a particular film is not shameful (羞恥스럽지) to show to foreigners. \"Confidence\" can be interpreted (解釋) in many ways. For example, the Japanese (內地) film \"Horse\" (馬) was artistically well-made and a successful work (成功한 作品), but its screening in Manchuria was banned (禁止). Why was that? Because \"Horse\" depicted the extreme poverty (甚한 貧困相) of some rural villages in Japan, there was concern that Manchurians might gain a misunderstanding (誤解) of Japanese rural life. From this perspective,<168> Korean films also, besides artistic success, must send good works that will not cause foreigners to misunderstand Korea when shown.\n\nThe Easiness of Dance\n\nCho T'aek-wŏn: From that standpoint, the advancement of dance onto the Mainland seems very good. Dance is not an art of language (言語) but an art of movement (動作), so unlike theater, it doesn't need to be limited to Korean audiences. Also, the number of personnel (人員), including lighting and music staff (照明音樂人), needs only be six or seven (六七人), and there are few props (道具), making advancement to places like Shanghai very easy (容易). Furthermore, unlike film or literature, it doesn't show aspects of poverty (貧困相) or points that could be misunderstood (誤解될) to foreigners, so it seems flawless (無欠) from various perspectives. Consequently, even Korean classical dance can cater to the tastes (口味) of people from various countries, which is good. Especially since no Korean dancer has ever performed in Shanghai before, through the planning (企劃) of the Korean cultural figures there, we could let the Chinese know that such dance art exists in Korea, and thereby also plan for the exchange of dance art.\n\nGathering Material on the Mainland\n\nYi Ch'ang-yong: In any case, advancing dance, theater, or film onto the Mainland to exchange cultures within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is a most significant (意義있는) thing. From our perspective as film planners (映畵企劃者), there is a desire (意慾) to produce films set on the Mainland (大陸을 舞臺로). Mr. Pak Kŏ-yŏng, might there be any material (材料) suitable for gathering (取材) in Shanghai?\n\nPak Kŏ-yŏng: I think that's a very good idea. What kind of material meeting which intention (意圖) are you requesting (要求)?\n\nYi Ch'ang-yong: For example, instances where Koreans in Shanghai helped the Imperial Army (皇軍) in very moving scenes (感激한 場面), or scenes of Korean sincerity (赤誠場面) appropriate to the current situation (時局), while also not ignoring (無視) whether they can serve as film material (素材).<169>\n\nPak Kŏ-yŏng: Regarding that, I plan to collect (蒐集) and supply (供給) materials in the future, and I will pay special attention (留意) to that point.\n\nAn Chong-hwa: Planning for cultural exchange through film by gathering such local material is a very meaningful (有意義) thing.\n\nThe Mainland and Literature\n\nKim Tong-hwan: Regarding literature (文學), Mr. Pak Yŏng-hŭi (朴英熙), Secretary-General of the Korean Writers Association (朝鮮文人協會幹事長), and Mr. Paek Ch'ŏl (白鐵) from the Arts Department of the Maeil Sinbo Company (每日申報社學藝部) were scheduled to attend (參席) tonight, but it is very regrettable (遺憾) that both were unable to attend (不參) due to circumstances (事情). It would be good if literature could also be mentioned (言及).\n\nPak Kŏ-yŏng: In my opinion, it would be good to dispatch writers engaged in Central China (中支의 從事文人派遣) to develop the literary cultivation (筆耕) of Korean writers in Mainland literature (大陸文學), frontline literature (戰線文學), and pioneer literature (開拓文學).\n\nHam Tae-hun: This year, Kim Tong-in (金東仁), Pak Yŏng-hŭi (朴英熙), and Im Hak-su (林學洙) went as a literary delegation for comforting the Imperial Army on the North China front line (北支第一線 皇軍慰問文壇使節) to Yünch'eng (運城), which was then the very front line (最前戰線) in Shansi Province (山西省). \"Frontline Travels\" (戰線紀行) and \"Frontline Poetry Collection\" (戰線詩集) were published afterwards. I think it would be good for them to go to the Central China (中支) area as well.\n\nKim Tong-hwan: Regarding war correspondents (從軍文人) in Central China, although there have been several dispatches (派遣) from the Japanese literary world (內地文壇), there have not yet been any from the Korean literary world (朝鮮文壇). It would be very good if the Writers Association could work in that direction, so that through literature, we can provide even a little help in establishing (樹立) the great ideal of East Asian Co-Prosperity.\nWell then, the scheduled time (豫定한 時間) has already passed, so I will close the meeting (閉會) here.\n-(End)- <170>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis 1941 roundtable transcript details a meeting between Korean cultural figures from Seoul (Kyŏngsŏng) and a representative from Shanghai, Pak Kŏ-yŏng. The discussion focuses on fostering cultural exchange (theater, film, dance, literature) between Koreans in both cities, explicitly framed as contributing to Japan's \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.\" Participants outline the state of arts in Korea under the \"New Order,\" mentioning the establishment of associations, training institutes, and the promotion of \"National Drama\" aligned with state ideology. They discuss the practical challenges of exporting culture, particularly the high cost and logistical difficulties of sending theater troupes to Shanghai and beyond, contrasting this with the relative ease of distributing films or sending small dance troupes. The need for films and performances to be suitable for foreign audiences (implying self-censorship of negative portrayals) is also highlighted.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, the article is revealing for its explicit articulation of cultural activities as tools for promoting Japanese imperial ideology (\"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere,\" \"National Drama,\" \"Japan-Korea Unity\"). It provides concrete details about the organization and control of the arts under late colonial rule (associations, registration systems, government support/oversight) and illustrates the pressures artists faced to align their work with the \"current situation\" (時局). The discussion on avoiding \"shameful\" portrayals for foreign audiences underscores the propaganda function expected of colonial culture. The participation of prominent cultural figures and the practical considerations discussed offer valuable insights into the lived experience and compromises of artists during this period.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n上海\t상하이\tShanghai\n京城\t경성\tKyŏngsŏng\n藝術家\t예술가\tArtists\n交驩\t교환\tInterchange\n座談會\t좌담회\tRoundtable Discussion\n上海劇藝術硏究會\t상해극예술연구회\tShanghai Theater Arts Research Society\n三千里社\t삼천리사\tSamch'ŏlli Company\n朝鮮\t조선\tKorea\n大陸\t대륙\tMainland (often referring to China)\n朴巨影\t박거영\tPak Kŏ-yŏng\n文化團體\t문화단체\tCultural Organizations\n大東亞共榮團\t대동아공영권\tGreater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\n半島同胞\t반도동포\tPeninsula Compatriots (Koreans)\n軍當局\t군당국\tMilitary Authorities\n總領事館\t총영사관\tConsulate General\n朝鮮總督府上海出張所\t조선총독부 상해출장소\tGovernment-General of Korea Shanghai Branch\n海內\t해내\tWithin the sea (Homeland, i.e., Korea proper)\n演劇部門\t연극부문\tTheater Sector\n朝鮮映畵人協會\t조선영화인협회\tKorean Film Artists Association\n安鍾和\t안종화\tAn Chong-hwa\n朝鮮演劇協會\t조선연극협회\tKorean Theater Association\n李瑞求\t이서구\tYi Sŏ-gu\n現代劇場\t현대극장\tHyŏndae Theater\n柳致眞\t유치진\tYu Ch'i-jin\n國民演劇硏究所\t국민연극연구소\tNational Theater Research Institute\n咸大勳\t함대훈\tHam Tae-hun\n朝鮮映畵文化硏究所\t조선영화문화연구소\tKorean Film Culture Research Institute\n李創用\t이창용\tYi Ch'ang-yong\n舞踊家\t무용가\tDancer\n趙澤元\t조택원\tCho T'aek-wŏn\n金寬洙\t김관수\tKim Kwan-su\n高麗映畵社\t고려영화사\tKoryŏ Film Company\n金永壽\t김영수\tKim Yŏng-su\n京城日報社\t경성일보사\tKyŏngsŏng Ilbo Company\n田中宏\t다나카 히로시\tTanaka Hiroshi\n須田靜夫\t스다 시즈오\tSuda Shizuo\n金東煥\t김동환\tKim Tong-hwan\n朴啓周\t박계주\tPak Kye-ju\n京城雅叙團\t경성아서단\tKyŏngsŏng Asadan\n統制機關\t통제기관\tControl Organization\n新體制\t신체제\tNew Order/New System\n國民劇\t국민극\tNational Drama\n黑龍江\t흑룡강\tHŭngnyonggang (Black Dragon River -

朝鮮과 大陸과의 藝術交驩을 말하는 座談會를 開催하여합니다. 特히 上海로부터 上海劇藝術硏究會總務로 계신 朴巨影君이 入城하여 上海朝鮮人文化團體와 朝鮮의 諸文化團體와의 提携를 爲해 活動中인바, 그 提携를 爲한 雙方의 意見을 交換하여 써 朝鮮文化의 大陸進出等을 꾀하며, 이러한 우리의 文化部間의 活動을 通해서 我國의 最高指標인 大東亞共榮團建設에 多少의 도움이라도 된다고 하면 이는 正히 우리의 共通된 感激이 아닐수 없을것입니다. 그런데 于先 朴巨影君을 여러분에게 紹介하고 이 會를 進行하여합니다.\n朴巨影-매우 奔忙하심도 不拘하시고 이처럼 參席해 주셔서 感謝하기 짝이 없습니다. 지금 金東煥氏가 말씀하신대로, 上海에는 八千名이라느 半島同胞가 居留하고 있는데, 事變以後 思想客들도 모두 轉向했고, 實業界에 있어서도 敏腕를 보이여 朝鮮人으로서의 地盤도 커서 外國人에게 匹敵하는 地位를 갖고있으며, 더욱 貧弱하나바 우리의 손으로 組織된 文化關係도 있어서 如何히 하면 朝鮮內의 先輩들과 幄手하고 連絡을 取하며 또는 指導와 援助를 받을＜162＞수가 있을까하는 諸希望을 품고 京城을 찾아왔습니다. 上海의 우리 文化團體라고하면 그리 크게 떠들 程度는 못되지만 最近 一二年內에 매우 活潑한 움지김을 呈하여 各方面의 聲援도 자못 큽니다. 上海에는 現在 朝鮮人으로 組織된 新聞社, 雜誌社, 俱樂部, 靑年會, 映畵館, 幼稚園, 劇藝術硏究會等 諸團體가 있어서 모두 軍當局과 總領事館, 朝鮮總督府上海出張所當局의 支持로 時局의 線에 沿하여 運營되여 가는데, 海內와의 連絡도 함께 要望하는바입니다. 그런데 爲先 朝鮮의 諸文化團體의 動向과 現狀을 拜聽코저 합니다.\n金東煥-朝鮮文化의 現狀報告에 있어서 演劇部門부터 말씀해 주시면 좋겠습니다.\n\n出席者\n上海劇藝術硏究會側 朴巨影\n×\n朝鮮映畵人協會長 安鍾和\n朝鮮演劇協會長 李瑞求\n現代劇場代表 柳致眞\n國民演劇硏究所長 咸大勳\n朝鮮映畵文化硏究所長 李創用\n舞踊家 趙澤元\n朝鮮演劇協會理事 金寬洙\n高麗映畵社宣傳部 金永壽\n京城日報社學藝部 田中宏\n京城日報社學藝部 須田靜夫\n本社側\n金東煥\n朴啓周\n日時, 八月三日午後六時\n場所, 京城雅叙團 홀\n\n演劇協會의 現狀\n李瑞求-朝鮮에는 從來 많은 演劇團體가 있었으나 統制機關이 없었기 때문에, 自由行動을 取해왔고, 또 組織에 있어서나 上演脚本에 있어서도 自由主義的傾向에 處해있었으므로 不健全한 演劇行動이 많았던것은 否定할수 없는 事實로서 이를 統制하고 强化하여써 新體制에 卽應한, 이를테면 演劇을 通하여서 國家意識을 더욱 굳게 把握케 하고, 國民生活의 向上을 꾀하려는 意味에서 昨年十二月에 演劇協會를 創立하였습니다. 創立當時에는 九個劇團만 承認했으나 現在는 二十二個劇團이 當局과 本協會의 承認밑에서 健全한 步調를 옮기고 있는바,＜163＞ 特히 現代劇場에서는 國民劇이라는 健實하고도 時勢에 適切한 演劇行動을 取하여서 劇界의 한 龜鑑이 되어줄뿐아니라 特히 演技者의 質的向上을 爲해서 國民演劇硏究所까지 創設하여 現在 六十名의 俳優를 養成하고 있습니다. 極히 簡單하나마 大略 以上에 말씀드린것이 우리 協會가 一年間 걸어온 걸음입니다.\n金東煥-다음엔 柳致眞氏가, 現代劇場이 標榜하는 國民劇「黑龍江」公演에 關해서 말씀해주십시오.\n柳致眞-「黑龍江」은 제 自身이 지은 作品이기 때문에 무예라 말씀드리기가 거북합니다. 마는 國民劇이라는 그 自體에 關하여서 몇말씀 드리고저 합니다. 國民劇은 現時局에 鑑하여 社會의 關心의 的이 뇌여있는데, 그 內容에 있어서 藝術意識이라는것도 喪失치 말아야 하겠지만 그와 함께 國家理念의 發掦에 資함이 있지않아서는 안될것이외다. 그러나 그것은 自然的發生, 卽, 人間本能의 苦惱로부터 步一步로 國家의 大理想에 到達하는 自然的發展이라야 할것입니다. 無論 國民演劇은 리알에 脚理하여 그 理念을 浪漫에까지 發展시켜야하겠지만 그 方法에 있어서는 두가지 方向이 있다고생각합니다. 其一은 線이 가늘고 纖細한 主로 曲線의 美를 表現하는 幻想的인 東洋畵的手法이오, 其二는 그와 反對로 線이 굵고 直線的인, 이를테면 西洋畵的인것입니다.「黑龍江」은 後者를 擇한 素朴하고도 理性的인것을 리알한것에 取扱하여, 大陸氣質의 다이나믹크한 迫眞力을 浪漫에까지 發展시키려 한것입니다. 無論 여기에서 말하는 浪漫은 김이 빠진 노스탈쟈가 아니고 沸騰하는 理念의 昇華를 가르침이외다. 以上에 말씀드린것이 우리 現代劇場의 演劇行動이올시다.\n\n移動劇團에 對하여\n\n金東煥-이번에는 演劇協會內에 새로 組織된「移動劇團」에 對해서 金寬洙氏가 말씀해 주시면 고맙겠습니다.\n金寬洙-移動劇團은 全혀 文化의 惠澤을 浴하지 못하는 農村, 鑛山漁村等의 勞務者들에게 健全明朗한 演劇을 주어서 그들에게 慰安을 주고 따라서 그들로 하여금 勤勞에 對한 感謝, 或은 明朗한 氣分으로 動勞에 處하게하여 生産擴充을 꾀하며, 및 地方文化의 確立과 아울러 愛國思想을 涵養, 時局認識의 徹底化等을 期하려 함인데, 于先 團員을 募集했던바 志願者 六十餘名中에서 男子十一名, 女子五名을 選出했으며 더욱 지난 六月二十五日부터 一個月間 講習會가 있었고, 現在는 每日 午後마다 猛練習中입니다. 그리고 八月十日에 試演會와＜164＞壯行會를 擧行한 後, 八月十五日부터 京畿道를 爲始해서 巡演하려합니다. 入場料는 無料로 하려하였으나 運營上 困難이 甚하기때문에 鑛山經營者側에서 負擔하면 勞務者들은 無料로 觀覽케 될것이지만 其外는 될수있는대로 最廉價로 하려합니다.\n\n國民劇硏究所의 槪況\n\n金東煥-이번엔 國民演劇硏究所의 現狀에 對해서 咸大勳氏가 함씀해주십시오.\n咸大勳-國民演劇硏究所는 現代劇場의 姉妹團體로서 主로 俳優養成과 및 俳優의 質的向上을 爲主하는데, 지난 五月十五日에 開講하여 第一期修業은 八月十五日까집니다. 講師는 軍, 官, 民의 權威者를 網羅했으며, 特히 學界의 權威者와 各方面의 指導的地位에 있는 藝術家諸氏를 動員하였고, 應募者一百八十四名中에서 六十名만을 選拔하여 第一期硏究生으로 入所시켰습니다. 敎授科目은 國語, 國史, 世界情勢, 藝術全般, 俳優術演出術, 戱曲, 舞臺, 美術, 音樂, 舞踊等이외다.\n\n映畵協會의 現狀\n\n金東煥-다음, 安鍾和氏가 映畵協會에 對해서 함씀해주십시오.\n安鍾和-朝鮮의 映畵는 二十年이라는 長久한 歷史를 가지고 있는데 協會가 創設되기는 昨年十月이였습니다. 現在 映畵製作所는 朝鮮映畵株式會社, 高麗映畵社等을비롯하여 十個會社가 있으며 昨年 當局의 映畵令에 依해서 映畵人技術者登錄制가 實施되여 第一期에 十六名, 第二期二十名, 都合 八十名의 技術者가 登錄되였습니다. 技術者라하면, 監督(演出者), 撮影者, 演技(男女俳優)等을 總稱함인데, 登錄받지못한 者는 映畵製作에 全혀 關聯資格이 없습니다. 다음 映畵文化에 關해서는 李創用氏가 따로 말씀하겠기에 略합니다마는 近者에 와서 各 映畵會社合同問題가 盛히 떠들어 一般의 注視의 的이 되어있으나 아직 그 實現을 보지못했으며, 앞으로 新體制의 旗帳밑에서 좋은 解決을 보리라 믿습니다.\n\n朝鮮映畵界의 動態\n\n金東煥-映畵製作과 配給等에 對해서 李創用氏가 말씀해주십시오.\n李創用-映畵人協會에는 아직 演劇界와같이 第二世養成機關도 없고, 또 活動하는 時日보다  休息하고있는 時間이 더 많이 있게되는듯싶게 보여져서 그 成果란 大端히 微微한 觀을 呈하고 있습니다. 事實 朝鮮에 十個映畵社가 있다고 해도 一年에 製作本數가 五六本에서 不過하며, 今年같은해는 三四本의 製作도 볼수없으니 이렇다하는 進步를 보여주질 못했습＜165＞니다. 여기엔 그 한가지 理由로는, 企業家의 立場에서 볼때, 映畵會社合同問題라는것이 크게 關聯되고있는것입니다. 資本家편에서는, 現在 盛히 問題化되고 있는 映畵業者統制에 依한 合同運動의 今後歸趨를 보아서 製作에 着手하겠다는, 卽 合同된다면 구태여 巨額을 던져 映畵를 製作할것이 없다는 見地에서 休業狀態에 있습니다. 無論 當局이 合同問題를 提示한것은 朝鮮映畵界로 하여금 보다 훌륭한 發展과 向上을 爲해서이고, 따라서 國家理念에 基調하여 育成하자는것이기 때문에 吾人은 그 目的을 向하여 協力邁進해야 할것입니다. 內地에는 松竹만해도 千餘名의 映畵人을 包容하고있으며, 全日本을 통털어 놀라운 數字를 헤이는 映畵人이 있어서 巨大한 足蹟을 남기고 있지만 朝鮮에는 不過八十名으로써도 全허 微微한 狀態에 處해있다는것은 吾人으로 하여금 再反省을 促하게 하는바입니다. 配給에 있어서는 內地, 滿洲, 北至까지도 손을 뻗고있으나 上海方面에는 아직 配給되지 않었습니다.\n\n國民舞踊의 公演\n\n金東煥-다음, 舞踊에 있어서 趙澤元氏가 말씀해 주십시오.\n趙澤元-우리 舞踊家는 諸藝術團體에 比하여 그 數爻가 적으니만치 活動亦是 매우 微微합니다. 朝鮮舞踊界의 先驅者요 元老린 韓成俊氏가 數月前에 文化賞을 탓고 崔承喜氏가 歐米行脚으로부터 歸國하여 歸國公演이 있었으며, 朝鮮서는 嚆矢라고할 國民舞踊이 朝鮮演藝協會主催로 저와 및 石井舞踊所의 內地女子들이 出演했었는데, 이는 內鮮一體의 史實을 主題로한「夫餘回想曲」으로, 京城서와 大邱에서 公演해서 많은 成果를 얻었습니다.\n\n上海朝鮮人文化團體의 動向\n\n金東煥-다음은 朴巨影君으로부터 上海諸文化團體의 報告를 듣기로합시다.\n朴巨影-上海라고하면 이름은 크지만 우리의 文化活動範圍는 極히 幼稚한편에 屬할것입니다. 金璟載氏를 副社長(社長은 無)으로한 五十萬圓全額拂込의 華文版(日刊新聞)「上海時報社」가 純全히 우리 朝鮮人의 손으로 經營되여나간다는것은 매우 놀라운 일이며, 同社 營業局長, 編輯局長等 幹部는 모두 朝鮮人입니다. 그리고 朝鮮文雜誌로는 前에 李甲寧氏主宰下에 發刊되던 月刊「光化」가 그間 休刊되여 있었는데 今番 金璟載氏가 光化社를 引繼해서 相當한 基金으로 續刊하게 됐으며, 上海에는 아시다싶이 朝鮮文活字가 없기 때문에 前朝鮮中央日報社의 文活를＜166＞全部購入하여 上海로 가져갓습니다. 其外 金璟載氏가 四十五萬딸라를 投하여 從來 外國人이 經營하던 「우이리스 大戱院」을 買收하여 三層洋館의 映畵館이 亦是 우리의 손으로 上海라는 國際都市에서 堂堂히 外國人과 어깨를 겨루고 나아갑니다. 其外에는 우리「上海劇藝術硏究會」, 上海朝鮮文化人으로 組織된「上海鷄林俱樂部」,「上海鷄林靑年團」이 있고, 또 우리손으로 經營하는「上海養正幼稚園」等이 있습니다.\n\n上海의 中國人文化團體\n\n柳致眞-中國人의 文化團體로는 무엇무엇 있습니까.\n朴巨影-中日文化協會, 이것은 本部가 南京에 있는것인데 汪精衛, 褚民誼, 林伯生, 阿部前大使等 諸氏로 組織된 日支提携, 善隣友好共同防共의 三大原則에 基하여 組織된것이며, 映畵製作會社로는「藝華影業公司」,「新華影業公司」等이 있고, 劇團으로는「天馬」,「中國旅行」,「天風」等이 있는데, 우리가 想像하던 以上의 演技와 또는 藝術的芳香이 무르익은 그러한 劇을 우리에게 보여주어 實로 그 水準이 外國에 比하여 遜色이었다고도 보았습니다. 그 外에도 我國側의 上海每日新聞社, 大陸新報社, 雜誌로는「大陸往來」,「楊子江」等이 있고, 其他, 藝文會, 長江會上海歌人社, 上海新報, 新由報等, 文化團體가 있습니다.\n\n朝鮮과 大陸과의 藝術의 交流\n\n金東煥-어떻게 하면 朝鮮의 演劇映畵, 舞踊, 文學等을 大陸에 가져갈수 있을까? 卽, 大陸에 있는 朝鮮人에게 海內의 文化를 傳하여서 彼此의 文化交流를 보자는것에 忌憚없으신 意見을 提示해주기를 바랍니다.\n朴巨影-上海에있는 朝鮮人들도 늘 그리운것이 海內의 消息이고, 또 이렇게 해서든지 半島의 映畵, 演劇, 文學, 舞踊에 接하고싶다는것이 共通된 希望으로 朝鮮映畵의 上海輸出, 또는 朝鮮劇團의 上海에 招聘等을 提唱한 일도 있었습니다. 그 點에 關헤서 意見交換이 있었으면 합니다.\n\n演劇進出의 難點\n\n李瑞求-昨年에 放送協會에서 演藝團(노래, 춤, 經演劇, 漫談)을 組織해가지고 上海를 爲始해서 中支, 北支等地의 皇軍과 海外同胞慰問次로 巡演하려고 했었는데, 無論 營利를 目的함이 아니고 損을 볼지라도 좋다는 見地에서 하려했었으나, 現地에 相對하고 갈 人物이 없어서 中止 했습니다. 上海만은 當時 李甲寧氏가 나서서 모든 것을 周旋해주고, 또 上海에서의 損害도 負擔하마했었으나,＜167＞그것은 上海뿐이고, 徐州, 靑島, 濟南, 天津, 北京等地는 누가 그렇게 나서서 周旋해줄사람이 아무리 생각해도 없었습니다. 그렇다고 上海한곳만 갔다오자면 그것은 엄청난 時日과 經費가 들기 때문에 그럴수는 없었습니다.\n金寬洙-數日前 朴巨影氏도 協會에 오셔서 朝鮮劇團도 上海에 招聘하고싶다는 말씀을 하섰는데, 現在 朝鮮內의 諸劇團은 滿洲의 圖們, 延吉, 龍井, 牡丹江, 甚至於, 佳木斯와같은 奧地에까지도 들어가게 되는것은 交通이 便利해서 中途에서 하루도 쉬지않고 낮에는 汽車에서자고 밤에는 公演할수있는 關係로 損을보는 일이 없으나 上海에는 來往하노라고 中途에서 虛費하는 日字가 벌써 十餘日을 잡아먹게되고 上海에 가서도 八千名朝鮮人이 한사람도 빠지지않고 總動員해서 入場한다해도 三日間收入으로는 團員一同의 旅費도 모자랄 形便이니 其他 道具運搬, 食費, 經費, 宣傳費等은 너무도 엄청난 赤子를 보여주므로 매우 어려운 일입니다. 그렇다고 이 損을 現地同胞에게 짐지운다는것은 慰問의 精神에서 背馳되므로 全혀 不可能한 일이아닐까 생각합니다.\n咸大勳-그렇더래도 上海만을 目的하지않고, 最初 上海에서 公演하고 다음 徐州, 靑島, 開封, 天津北京等地로 巡演하면서 돌아나온다면 上海에만 갔다오는것보다는 그리 損이 없으리라고 보는데요.\n李瑞求-何如間 上海를 爲始해서 徐州, 靑島, 開封, 天津北京에서 모두 周旋해주는 相對者가 있다면 演劇의 大陸行도 안될 理가 없다고 생각합니다.\n\n大陸輸出에의 映畵使命\n\n李創用-映畵에 있어서는 俳優派遣이나 또는\n道具運搬等이 必要없고 單只 ■님만 보내면 問題가 解決되기 때문에 演劇에 比해서는 顯著한 差異가있어서 朝鮮映畵의 大陸進出 卽, 現地上映은 매우 容易한데 問題는 上海映畵配給統制機關인 中華映畵社의 幹旋을 잘받도록 할것과, 또 한가지는 映畵는 演劇과 달라서 그 觀客이 朝鮮人에게만 限해지는것이 아니고 內地人이나 外國人도 볼수있기 때문에 單只 問題는 이 映畵면 外國人에게도 羞恥스럽지 않다는 自身이 있는 映畵라면 足할것이외다. 自身이라는데는 여러 가지 解釋이 붙지만, 例컨대 內地映畵의「馬」라는 映畵는 映畵藝術 그 自體로서는 훌륭히 잘됐고 成功한 作品이지만 이 映畵가 滿洲에서의 上映은 禁止되였습니다. 웨그런고 하니「馬」에는 內地의 一部農村의 너무도 甚한 貧困相을 描寫한것이기 때문에 滿洲人이 日本農村에 對한 誤解를 가지지 않을까하는 點에서였습니다. 이러한 見地에서＜168＞朝鮮映畵亦是 藝術的인 成功도 成功이려니와 外國人에게 보혀서 朝鮮을 誤解하지않을 그러한 좋은 作品을 보내지 않아서는 안되리라 생각합니다.\n\n舞踊의 容易性\n\n趙澤元-그러한 點에서 舞踊의 大陸進出은 매우 좋다고 생각합니다. 舞踊은 言語의 藝術이 아니고 動作의 藝術이기 때문에 演劇처럼 朝鮮人에게 限해서 觀覽시킬것도 아니고, 또 人員도 照明音樂人까지 合처서 六七人이면 足하기 때문에 그리고, 道具도 別로 없기 때문에 上海等地의 進出까지도 매우 容易하며, 映畵나, 文學과 같이 貧困相이나 또는 誤解될 그러한 點을 外國人에게뵈이는것이 없기 때문에 諸點에서 보아서 無欠하다고 생각합니다. 따라서 朝鮮의 古典 舞踊이라고 할지라도 各國人의 口味에도 迎合될수 있는것이여서 좋다고 봅니다. 特히 上海에는 아직까지도 朝鮮舞踊家가 公演해본일이 없기 때문에 그곳 朝鮮文化人들의 企劃에서 中國人에게도 朝鮮에 이러한 舞踊藝術이 있다는것을 알려주고, 이로써 舞踊藝術의 交流도 꾀할수있다고 생각합니다.\n\n大陸에의 取才\n\n李創用-如何튼, 舞踊이나 演劇이나 映畵等을 大陸에 進出시켜 大東亞共榮圈內의 各文化를 交流시킴은 가장 意義있는 일이라 생각하며, 우리 映畵企劃者側에서도 大陸을 舞臺로 한 映畵製作의 意慾이 있는데, 朴巨影氏, 어디 上海에 取材할 材料가 없겠습니까.\n朴巨影-거 매우 좋은 意見이라고 생각합니다. 그런데 어떠한 意圖에 迎合되는 素材를 要求하시는지요.\n李創用-말하자면, 上海에 있는 朝鮮人이 皇軍을 도와서 매우 感激한 場面이 있었다든가, 또는 時局에 適切한 朝鮮人의 赤誠場面等인데, 亦是 映畵의 素材가 될수있다는것을 無視하지않은것으로＜169＞말입니다.\n朴巨影-그것에 對해서는 앞으로 材料도 蒐集해서 供給하려하며 또 그런 點에 特히 留意하려합니다.\n安鍾和-그러한 現地의 取材로서 映畵를 通한 文化의 交流를 꾀하는 것은 매우 有意義한 일이라 생각합니다.\n\n大陸과 文學\n\n金東煥-文學에 있어서는 오늘 저녁에 朝鮮文人協會幹事長朴英熙氏와 每日申報社學藝部白鐵氏가 參席키로 했었는데 事情에 依해서 두분 다 不參하게된것은 매우 遺憾된일이지만. 文學에 있어서도 言及해 주시면 좋겠습니다.\n朴巨影-제 생각엔 中支의 從事文人派遣이 있어서 大陸文學, 戰線文學, 開拓文學等에 朝鮮文人의 筆耕을 開拓시킴이 좋다고 보는데요\n咸大勳-今年 北支第一線 皇軍慰問文壇使節로 金東仁, 朴英熙, 林學洙三氏가 當時 山西省의 最前戰線인 運城까지 갔다와서「戰線紀行」,「戰線詩集」等이 發刊되였었습니다마는 中支方面에도 갔다옴이 좋으리라 생각합니다.\n金東煥-中支의 從軍文人, 勿論, 內地文壇에서는 數次의 派遣이 있었으나 아직 朝鮮文壇에서는 없었는데, 文人協會에서 그 方面에 活動해주어서 文學을 通하여서는 東亞共榮의 大理想을 樹立함에 조금이라도 도움이 된다고하면 매우 좋을바라 생각합니다.\n그러면 豫定한 時間도 이미 지났으니 이것으로 閉會하려합니다.\n-(끝)-＜170＞\n＜162-170＞","magazine":"삼천리 제13권 제9호","date":"1941년 09월 01일 (September 1, 1941)","title":"Shanghai-Kyŏngsŏng \"Artist Exchange\"

snow on the front and back mountains.\nWhen young sprouts flutter on the grassy field,\nWhite clouds spread their wings and fly lightly.\n\nCarrying dreams, swallows come from Kangnam (江南),\nAt the eaves' edge, the heat haze shimmers, the path seems long.\nEven the bird, lonely in the cage through the cold winter,\nYearning for the blue sky, cries and cries again.\n\nThe flute sound in the heart overflows with hope,\nWhen flowers bloom, bees and butterflies, along the stream,\nEvery morning, may a new face be beautifully reflected.\n\nMorning of Hope\nCh'unwŏn\n\nNight has dawned, the morning of Hope!\nThe sunbeams rising in the eastern sky,\nEveryone receive them, receive them fully,\nAnd raising your voices, shout Mansei!\n\nArise! Receiving the command (吩咐)\nOf our Emperor, one hundred million hearts as one,\nThroughout the vast Heaven and Earth, under the principle of Eight Corners of the World Under One Roof (八紘一宇),\nTo build a new World.\n\nContinent of twenty thousand li, Great Ocean of one hundred thousand li,\nOf the Great Co-Prosperity Sphere (大共榮圈) of Great Asia (大亞細亞),\nWhere our Flag of the Rising Sun (日章旗) flies, <176>\nIs the land where descendants for ten thousand generations will enjoy blessings.\n\nMountain and Water\nKim Sang-yong\n\nThe song of new birds in the clear morning is beautiful!\nOne drunk on flower fragrance gets soaked in the grass color (草色).\nFrom the mountain top that even clouds rest to cross,\nI look down upon the vast fields of ten thousand li.\n\nFrom whose sorrow do the waves break?\nIt's distant, the water touches the sky.\nSeeing the boats returning to the Port (浦口),\nI yearn for the hometown of my heart.\n\nLetting sorrows flow away on the waves,\nI will climb the mountain and cleanse my heart with spiritual energy (靈氣).\nThe Life carefully nurtured by Heaven and Earth,\nI intend to cherish and live cleanly.\n\nVillage Where the Cuckoo Cries\nKim Tong-hwan\n\nOne\nWhere the cuckoo's cry is heard deep in the Green Mountains (靑山),\nLet's build a clean house and settle in.\nNilliriya, we young farmers,\nPlowing the field (밧갈고) and sowing seeds, let's live this life.\n\nTwo\nAmong the woods, the water mill turns by the stream,\nThe shaggy dog chases chickens and runs out to the field.\nNilliriya, our young ladies,\nRaising silkworms and weaving hemp, let's live joyfully.\n\nThree\nIf it doesn't finish crying this year, it cries next year,\nIf it can't play enough on this mountain, it goes to that mountain to play.\nNilliriya, in our village in the Green Mountains,\nThe cuckoo comes well every year and cries. <177>\n\nHow Nice is Our Home\nMo Yun-suk\n\nIt's nice, so nice, oh how nice!\nCan there be a place as good as my home?\nOn a chilly early winter night,\nThe warm lower part of our room's heated floor is nice.\nIn the scorching heat of May and June, under the blazing sun (볓불),\nThe main floor hall where the wind blows through freely is also nice.\n\nIt's nice, so nice, oh how nice!\nCan there be a place as good as my home?\nSwallows on the clothesline, sunny spring sunlight,\nThe rhythm of the cutting board knife in the kitchen is also nice.\nOn an evening when fluffy snow piles up deep,\nThe swish-swish sound of the broom is refreshing too.\n\nIt's nice, so nice, oh how nice!\nCan there be a place as good as my home?\nThe baby sibling taking first steps, playing \"round and round\",\nPlaying \"pat-a-cake\" and \"no-no\", their cute acts are nice.\nTasty morsels, for you and me,\nOur grandmother's stories (애기) are interesting too.\n\nComing Spring, Going Spring\nChu Yo-han\n\nSpring sky, far away\nBeyond the layers of clouds,\nSkylark, what task takes you\nHigher and higher?\nMissing the spring of home,\nMissing the spring of home,\nThe flock of swallows coming from Kangnam (江南),\nWill they come today?\nWill they come tomorrow?\nTo see if they are coming,\nI climb up. <178>\n\nLike silk thread unraveling,\nAn endless song,\nOriole, what task makes you\nSing all day long (하로종일)?\nMissing the spring breeze,\nMissing the spring breeze,\nThe young lady out for a stroll,\nHas spring already come?\nIs spring already going?\nTo let her know, to let her know (알래알래),\nThis is the song I offer.\n\nAcross the field, over the hill,\nRiding the heat haze,\nKite, what task makes you\nCircle the mountain peak?\nMissing the spring of home,\nMissing the spring of home,\nThe young man leaving on a long journey,\nThe great ambition once set,\nThe high, high hope,\nDo not forget, do not forget,\nI circle to remind you.\n\nEvening Star\nNo Ch'ŏn-myŏng\n\nOne\nWho scattered jewels in the sky?\nSmall jewels, large jewels, so beautiful.\nGathering around a bonfire, eating corn,\nThere were nights counting the stars in the sky.\n\nTwo\nOne star appears, two stars appear,\nIn the paddy fields, the cuckoo cries mournfully,\nAs the cornstalks rustle in the wind,\nGazing at the Milky Way, sleep drifted far away (머러저). <179>\n\nThree\nThe sound of the water mill—it's been long since I heard it—\nThe night sky full of stars in my hometown, a night I long for.\nPutting fireflies in pumpkin flower lanterns,\nAre the children these days also counting stars?\n\nWhen the Rugosa Roses Bloom\nKim Dong-hwan\n\nSpring March too fades before long,\nAs azaleas and apricot blossoms also fade,\nOn the sandy beach by the river in front of my hometown,\nBright red, bright red Rugosa roses (海棠花) bloom.\n\nWhen they bloom and smile, I was indifferent, but\nLeaving home and thinking of them, I miss them terribly.\nMy hometown where seabirds fly and waves crash,\nEven a dozen times a day, I visit in dreams.\nThis year too, after I left, in my hometown,\nReceiving the wind and rain gently, did the Rugosa roses bloom?\nI cannot forget, cannot forget, when the flower season comes,\nMy longed-for hometown, I truly cannot forget.\n\nSea\nIm Hak-su\n\nIn the morning, golden sunbeams,\nTen million waves each leap and play.\nIn the evening, flocks of seagulls,\nAt the cliff's edge, the Storm (暴風) rages.\n\nAt midday, flocks of white Sheep (羊),\nDistantly cross the Silver Line (銀線) and come, and come again.\nAs night falls, countless flowers,\nAbove my head, scatter brilliantly.\n\nAh, whether it rains or shines, <180>\nIn the shade of that blue island, the heart-rending Waves (波濤),\nIf I jump splash into them,\nAmong the grasses, Coral (珊瑚) and Pearls (眞珠) are intertwined (얼켜있다).\n\nHometown House\nChu Yo-han\n\nOne\nOn the thatched roof,\nGourds hang open,\nOn the grain stack,\nFlocks of sparrows descend.\nMissing my hometown house,\nWhere the castor oil plants bear fruit,\nThe shaggy dog barking,\nMy mother, whom I saw in dreams daily.\nAh, today too, in dreams,\nI

were all commissioned by the Korean Broadcasting Association (朝鮮放送協會) from gentlemen of the poetry world to provide good songs for general households, and these are all the ballads (謠曲) that have been broadcast since last autumn. <185>\n<171-185>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis article presents a collection of \"New Songs\" (Sin'gayo), essentially poems intended for singing, composed by prominent Korean poets in 1941. Commissioned by the Korean Broadcasting Association, the poems cover a range of themes, from pastoral scenes, family life, and nature appreciation to overtly political and pro-war mobilization pieces. Several poems explicitly promote Japanese imperialism, praising volunteer soldiers, the Emperor, the \"Holy War,\" the concept of \"Naesŏn Ilch'e\" (Japan and Korea as One Body), and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.\n\nFor historians, this collection is significant as it starkly reveals the cultural mobilization efforts during the late colonial period. It showcases how leading Korean literary figures were enlisted (whether willingly or coerced) to produce propaganda supporting Japan's war effort and imperial ideology, blending nationalistic rhetoric with traditional poetic forms and themes. The juxtaposition of propagandistic verses with poems on nature and home life within the same collection highlights the complex and often pressured environment faced by intellectuals under colonial rule.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n朝鮮詩人諸氏\t조선시인제씨\tVarious Korean Poets\n春園\t춘원\tCh'unwŏn (pen name of Yi Kwang-su)\n日本\t일본\tJapan\n泰山\t태산\tMount T'aesan\n皇軍\t황군\tImperial Army\n日章旗\t일장기\tFlag of the Rising Sun (Nisshōki)\n朱耀翰\t주요한\tChu Yo-han\n梁柱東\t양주동\tYang Chu-dong\n李瑞求\t이서구\tYi Sŏ-gu\n신동아\t신동아\tNew East Asia (Possibly referring to the Co-Prosperity Sphere concept)\n朴鍾和\t박종화\tPak Chong-hwa\n月出峯\t월출봉\tWŏlch'ulbong (Moonrise Peak)\n大日本\t대일본\tGreat Japan (Dai Nippon)\n內鮮一體\t내선일체\tNaesŏn Ilch'e (Japan and Korea as One Body)\n皇道\t황도\tImperial Way\n町(洞里)會\t정(동리)회\tTown/Village Association (Chōkai/Tongnihoe)\n異河潤\t이하윤\tYi Ha-yun\n江南\t강남\tKangnam (South of the River, often referring to Southern China)\n八紘一宇\t팔굉일우\tP'alhong Ilch'a (Eight Corners of the World Under One Roof)\n大亞細亞\t대아세아\tGreat Asia (Dai Ajia)\n大共榮圈\t대공영권\tGreat Co-Prosperity Sphere (Daitōa Kyōeiken)\n金尙鎔\t김상용\tKim Sang-yong\n浦口\t포구\tP'ogu (Port/Harbor)\n金東煥\t김동환\tKim Tong-hwan\n靑山\t청산\tCh'ŏngsan (Green Mountains)\n毛允淑\t모윤숙\tMo Yun-suk\n盧天命\t노천명\tNo Ch'ŏn-myŏng\n林學洙\t임학수\tIm Hak-su\n珊瑚\t산호\tSanho (Coral)\n眞珠\t진주\tChinju (Pearl)\n金岸曙\t김안서\tKim An-sŏ\n동아공영권\t동아공영권\tEast Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere (Tōa Kyōeiken)\n高麗時代\t고려시대\tKoryŏ Dynasty\n樂章歌詞\t악장가사\tAkhak Kwebom (likely reference)\n靑山別曲\t청산별곡\tCh'ŏngsan Pyŏlgok (Song of the Green Mountains)\n朝鮮放送協會\t조선방송협회\tChosŏn Pangsong Hyŏphoe (Korean Broadcasting Association)\n\n**Glossary**\n\n志願兵\t지원병\tVolunteer soldier\n萬歲\t만세\tMansei (Korean equivalent of Banzai; lit. \"ten thousand years\")\n軍士\t군사\tSoldier (older term)\n惶悚합신\t황송하신\tAwed, humbled, deeply grateful (honorific, older form)\n끼끗한\t깨끗한\tClean, neat (older spelling)\n미더웁고\t믿음직하고\tReliable, trustworthy (older form/spelling)\n銃後奉公\t총후봉공\tHome front service (wartime term)\n凱旋\t개선\tTriumphant return\n차저가자\t찾아가자\tLet's seek/find and go (older spelling)\n바랑\t바랑\tMonk's backpack/wallet (used here more generally for backpack)\n수풀\t수풀\tForest, woods\n해돗는\t해 돋는\tSun-rising\n기룰제\t기를 때\tWhen raising (child) (older form/spelling)\n갈아뉘우며\t갈아 뉘이며\tChanging (diapers/bedding) and laying down (older form)\n달토록\t닳도록\tUntil worn out (older spelling)\n가이업서라\t끝이 없어라\tIs boundless, endless (older spelling/form)\n얼려주시고\t얼러주시고\tSoothing, coaxing (a child) (older spelling)\n문기대여\t문기대어\tLeaning on the door (older spelling)\n앓을사 그릇될사\t앓을까 그릇될까\tLest (the child) get sick, lest go astray (older grammar/form)\n고으시든\t고우시던\tWas beautiful/fair (honorific, older spelling)\n따우에\t땅 위에\tOn the earth/ground (older spelling)\n어마님\t어머님\tMother (older form/spelling)\n앗김없이\t아낌없이\tWithout stint, unsparingly (older spelling)\n거듸\t걷이/거둠\tHarvest (older form/spelling)\n널븐\t넓은\tWide, vast (older spelling)\n욱어진\t우거진\tOvergrown, thick (with vegetation) (older spelling)\n마쳐\t맞춰\tKeeping (rhythm), matching (older spelling)\n직힌\t지킨\tGuarded, protected (older spelling)\n갸륵하외다\t갸륵하외다\tIs praiseworthy, admirable (older polite ending)\n량식\t양식\tProvisions, food\n대본\t대본\tGreat foundation, basis\n달마지\t달맞이\tMoon viewing, moon greeting\n떨뜨리고\t떨어뜨리고\tDropping, letting fall (older form/spelling)\n홰\t홰\tTorch (made of bundled reeds/wood)\n윳가락\t윷가락\tYut sticks (for traditional game)\n遙拜\t요배\tWorship from afar (towards emperor/palace)\n黙禱\t묵도\tSilent prayer\n聖戰\t성전\tHoly War (term used by Japan for its wars)\n護國英靈\t호국영령\tGuardian spirits of the nation (often referring to war dead)\n臣民\t신민\tSubjects (of an emperor/monarch)\n內鮮一體\t내선일체\t\"Japan and Korea as One Body\" (Japanese assimilation policy slogan)\n皇道\t황도\tThe Imperial Way (Japanese political/spiritual ideology)\n宣揚\t선양\tProclaim, propagate\n町(洞里)會\t정(동리)회\tTown/Village Association (administrative unit under Japanese rule)\n압장잡\t앞장잡이\tLeader, vanguard (older spelling)\n깃드려있다\t깃들여 있다\tDwells, is harbored (older spelling)\n잇그러주는\t이끌어주는\tLeading, guiding (older spelling)\n첨아\t처마\tEaves (of a roof)\n아즈랑이\t아지랑이\tHeat haze (older spelling)\n하눌\t하늘\tSky (older spelling)\n궁성요배\t궁성요배\tWorship towards the Imperial Palace (in Tokyo)\n吩咐\t분부\tCommand, order (often from a superior/ruler)\n八紘一宇\t팔굉일우\t\"Eight Corners of the World Under One Roof\" (Japanese imperial slogan)\n大共榮圈\t대공영권\tGreater Co-Prosperity Sphere (Japan's envisioned empire)\n뉘\t뉘\tWhose (older form)\n서름\t설움\tSorrow, grief (older spelling)\n깨여지는지\t깨어지는지\tIs breaking (older spelling)\n다았네\t닿았네\tHas touched, reached (older spelling)\n밧갈고\t밭 갈고\tPlowing the field (older spelling)\n각씨\t각시\tYoung woman, bride (older term)\n닐니리야\t닐리리야\t(Likely a meaningless refrain in folk songs)\n샛밤\t섣달 밤?\tNight in the last lunar month?

In-hae\n\nThe mountain gorge (山峽) was endlessly high and rugged, deeply recessed and always profound.\nThe stream, which originated there, flowed winding around the folds of the layered mountain foothills, and even the clouds drifting at the edge of the sky rested before passing over.\nIt was Buddha's Birthday (四月八日), and the remote mountains had suddenly donned colorful attire. The azaleas blooming wide on the hills, though late in season, were blood-red as if vomiting blood, and from Talbawi Rock, a cock pheasant beat its wings and cried piercingly.\nIt was the peak season for mountain flowers (山花), and Sukmyŏng's heart, crossing the mountain ridges with urgency, felt exceptionally light.\nStanding stretched out on a rocky scree slope, he placed a hand on his forehead and watched the winding path at the foot of the slope, faintly veiled in the distant haze.\nOn the mountainside where only heat haze shimmered, alder, ash, birch, cherry trees... common deciduous trees (喬木) everywhere, having absorbed the midday sun, radiated a light green hue, and the interspersed green pines were fresh. Wild greens grew abundantly in the damp areas, filling the mountain gorge with fresh greenness and fragrance. <186>\nSukmyŏng waited endlessly for the female monk (女僧). It was her promise to visit unfailingly on Buddha's Birthday, and it was likely she would pass through this area today, as she did every year on Buddha's Birthday for grave tending (省墓) in the mountain gorge. For Sukmyŏng, the past year had effectively existed solely for this day. That was how much he anticipated Buddha's Birthday.\n\nSukmyŏng and his father were born, seemingly like a gust of wind, deep in these remote mountains. Completely severed from the world, they eked out a living by slash-and-burn farming on the steep mountain slopes. They planted grains and harvested whatever ripened, surviving on bellflowers, codonopsis, wild grapes, hardy kiwi, acorns—the wild fruits and greens abundant everywhere. It was an extremely primitive life.\nSukmyŏng never even conceived of questioning the reasons for their mountain life; having grown up mingling with the mountains since infancy, they were bound by the mountain's ways (習性).\nHis father was taciturn and reticent. A sickly man with a bloodless, gaunt face and slumped shoulders, he either lay huddled against the wall, lips pursed, coughing weakly, or sat slumped tending the meager crops on the steep, barren terraced fields. He shunned the ways of the world, living a life of complete seclusion.\nKnowing no one, they had no visitors. Lacking any significant material needs, they required no contact with the outside world. Untouched by the harsh ways of society, Sukmyŏng simply followed his father, diligently learning only work. He lived according to his circumstances in that narrow world, never knowing how to feel distressed by it, regarding the mountain gorge as the entirety of the universe.\nConsequently, he naturally learned the ways of nature, developing his character. Harmonizing (和) and mingling with the mountains, he nurtured a simple yet robust and abundant life force. He wrestled with mountain beasts (멫짐숭) as adversaries, driving them off with his bow until they couldn't stand.\nThus, their lonely life continued, and Sukmyŏng himself grew capable of managing the mountain household competently. Yet, his father was a man who had lost his laughter. Never once in his life did he let his guard down. In solitary moments, he would heave long sighs that seemed to make the earth sink. Sometimes he played the *t'ongso* (bamboo flute), its mournful melodies crawling over the mountain ridges. Occasionally, he would quietly leave the mountains and travel over a hundred *ri* to the market outside, returning with some needed supplies.\nEven so, Sukmyŏng felt no particular temptation from the world outside the mountains, simply enjoying the remote life according to nature's revelations. He explored deep mountains on his own, venturing into virgin territory, <187> leaving his footprints across tens of *ri* beyond the familiar mountain paths.\nThe beauty, seclusion, abundance, and pride of the mountains permeated his being, influencing him as he prepared for the full bloom of youth.\nThen, a great wonder (驚異) and anxiety confronted Sukmyŏng. It was around this time last year. He had gone into the mountains, intending to hunt, when suddenly, from somewhere, a loud explosion (爆音) echoed. It was a tremendous sound that made his chest reverberate dully. It was the dynamite sound of gold prospectors following a gold vein (金脈), but Sukmyŏng, his mind reeling, had no way of comprehending it. Eyes rolling in fury, he ran, crossing several mountains, trying to confront the source of the sound, but ended up chasing shadows. On his way back, utterly spent, he unexpectedly encountered a female monk (女僧).\nShe was a Buddhist nun carrying a pewter staff (錫杖), wearing a kasaya robe and a peaked hood, with a monastic satchel (바랑) slung over her shoulder. Below a secluded hill lay a small grave mound, overgrown with weeds that had flourished in the meantime, looking desolate and shabby. The nun was clearing the weeds and had gathered bunches of mountain flowers (山花) to offer. She knelt demurely, counting her prayer beads, praying for the repose of the soul buried there. Her eyes closed as if in a painting, lost in thought, she seemed unlikely to ever open them. Finally, she quietly raised her head and stood up. Her eyes met Sukmyŏng's. She seemed slightly taken aback, momentarily flustered, but maintained a composed demeanor despite her inner wariness. The nun glared sharply at Sukmyŏng.\n\"Who are you, a person in these deep mountains?\"\nHer voice was firm.\n\"I am a mountain dweller who knows nothing beyond this place.\"\nSukmyŏng retorted, taking a bold step closer. As they spoke, he realized this monk was not a man but a woman, and his heart pounded strangely.\n\"Why did you disguise yourself as a man?\"\nSukmyŏng coaxed slyly. The nun's eyes instantly turned sharp and prickly.\n\"What impertinent young man speaks so disrespectfully...\"\nHer tone became distinctly curt, and she abruptly turned away, starting down the steep downhill slope. The woman, around forty, with a decent complexion, possessed an indefinable, abundant grace.\n\"As an ignorant rustic, perhaps I am excused for my offense? The mountains are too confining; please teach me about the bright world...\"\nSukmyŏng pleaded, kneeling before the nun with utmost earnestness. The female monk hesitated several times, <188>\n\"I too am one who fled the mundane world. How can I be a guide for another? Live according to your circumstances in these mountains, and let us meet here again next spring on this day. *Namu Amit'a Pul*...\"\nThe nun pulled away and hurried off down the mountain.\nChanting prayers...\nTo his desperate plea to tell him his lifelong wish, her reply to meet again next year did not seem merely coincidental to Sukmyŏng.\n\nReturning to his solitary mountain hut, Sukmyŏng lost his peace of mind and began to feel restless. The realization that another world existed beyond his own surroundings, which he had considered the entirety of the universe, a world independent of his will and actions—the greater Sukmyŏng's wonder at this fact, the greater his inner turmoil.\nEven when trying to forget his worries and diligently tending the fields or chopping wood as usual, Sukmyŏng's eyes, observing beautiful flowers or crying mountain beasts, would shift to complex interpretations.\nButterflies flew in pairs, mountain birds invariably in pairs. A cock pheasant calling its mate upon seeing fragrant food. Sukmyŏng mimicked its seductive cry, \"Piriri...\". The male pheasant that had been crying \"Kkyeok-kkyeok\" from Talbawi Rock swooped down towards the pine thicket where Sukmyŏng was hiding.\nSukmyŏng gripped his bow, nocked an arrow, and drew the string taut. But the arrow tore through the blue sky, its tail wagging as it flew off. The male pheasant, mistaking the sound for the hen's piercing cry, was lured into the pit of death! Sukmyŏng could not bring himself to pierce its red breast with the arrow.\nLifting his eyes to see where the arrow fell, he spotted a thicket lined with willows. There, too, a yellow oriole was flitting up and down, singing.\n\"Nal nugul nugul!\" (Who, who am I!)\nIf the female coaxed playfully, almost heartbreakingly,\n\"Nal nal...\" (Me, me...)\nThe male would boastfully respond with its customary flourish, then, swept up in their own passion, they tumbled over and under each other. Did the mountains and rivers echo? How shamelessly this scene made Sukmyŏng blush! Yet, while utterly perplexing, it was also a scene that cleared his mind.\nIt felt like the embers the female monk had left behind. He was nineteen, but having grown up solely in the remote mountains, he was essentially an innocent lad. Moreover, while Sukmyŏng was simple to the core, he had a large frame and a strong, clean-cut physique.\nSukmyŏng, seemingly grown into an adult overnight, began to explore the secrets of the universe <189> fearlessly and freely. This, perhaps, is the law of human growth.\nSuddenly, his helpless father seemed like an insignificant being. Gone were the times he cherished and cared for him; now, the old man's haggard, shabby, and gloomy appearance only seemed burdensome.\nThe father, in turn, was displeased as his son grew leaner by the day, becoming increasingly irritable and withdrawn like a brooding chick. As if wrinkles increased with every passing hour, his own limbs felt weary, the future seemed daunting, and the bitter past he thought buried resurfaced anew.\nThe reason he had fled the world was to atone for the failures of his life by tormenting and afflicting himself. And even that wouldn't have been so bad if it were for a worthy cause, but the sorrowful life ruined entirely because of a single woman—there was no further punishment needed.\nBut the law of human growth seemed formidable; inevitably forging its own path, an irrepressible, immense power grew steadily within Sukmyŏng. No matter how one tried to control it, there was no way to capture a young spirit.\n\nIt was around the time of *Paengno* (白露 - White Dew) that year. When the autumn colors quickly touched the leaves of the sensitive maple trees, wild ginseng collectors (*simmani*, 採蔘人) swarmed into these mountains. While the old man was startled, Sukmyŏng's surprise was greater. Though such collectors had occasionally passed through before, maybe once or twice, they had always been neatly attired men. But now, amidst their crude temporary shelters, he sensed, for the first time in his life, a peculiar fragrance—it emanated from a delicate, slender girl, like a fragile flute.\nThough they say bringing such a girl along invites misfortune when digging for ginseng, this group seemed to make a living from collecting ginseng, moving from mountain to mountain as wanderers.\nWaking up in their mountain huts, the *simmani* would first offer devout prayers to the mountain spirit, pushing through dense forests and birds. Then, tying the laces (들메) of their mountain shoes (메투리), they would disperse to climb the mountains.\nEven upon seeing the tracks of large beasts (tigers, bears, wolves) that had shaken off the forest dew, sparkling like silver dust, and left their lairs, the *simmani*, trusting in the protection (두호) of the mountain spirit, felt no fear, concentrating solely on digging for ginseng.\nReturning from the mountains, they would lay their weary bodies down in the huts, spending the night absorbed in seeking auspicious dreams (吉夢). They courted sleep for the sake of dreams. After several such days and nights had passed, one night, <190> it was a night close to Ch'usŏk, with even a halo around the moon. All sounds of nature (萬籟) were asleep and silent. The pale moonlight softly covered the mountains and valleys. The mountains seemed higher, the forests deeper and more resonant. An owl hooted from some ridge, marking the mountain's presence, and from some woods, the cry of the *chŏptong새* (cuckoo) drifted interwovenly. On such a desolate night, growing deeper and deeper, Sukmyŏng drifted into a light sleep. Suddenly, it seemed the entire mountain range was engulfed in a downpour (소나기), raining incessantly. Then, as if by magic, the rain stopped, the sky cleared, and a rainbow, dazzlingly brilliant yet seeming close enough to touch, arched beautifully from the well here to a well across the pass.\nGazing entranced at such a beautiful rainbow, he suddenly saw a boy in a *ch'orip* (cone-shaped bamboo hat) running up, up towards the sky along the colorful bridge. Strangely, the boy suddenly transformed into Sukmyŏng himself. Sukmyŏng, treading air, flew through the void, then startled awake—it was a strange dream.\nFinding it absurd, Sukmyŏng pushed open the brushwood gate and stepped outside. Moonlight spilling from the edge of a cloud filled his arms. He stood relieving himself under a birch tree. Then, by the well opposite, a faint figure emerged—it was clearly the girl who had come to dig for ginseng.\nSukmyŏng hesitated, halting his steps, feeling his heart flutter. Leaning against a tree trunk, he watched for a while. The figure stood demurely by the well, like a painting. After hesitating for some time, Sukmyŏng abruptly walked over.\n\"Hey, what are you doing there?\"\nHe asked bluntly as he approached the girl. Startled, the girl turned, shyly fiddling with her luscious pigtail.\n\"Ah, you scared me! I thought you were someone else. I was just praying to the mountain spirit for a good dream.\"\nThe girl smiled faintly, adding that if the mountain spirit was displeased, there would be no dream, making ginseng digging impossible.\n\"A dream? What good is a dream like that?\"\n\"To find ginseng, you must first see a good dream.\"\n\"What kind of dream is good?\"\n\"Dreams are varied. Seeing a pig, or dreaming of a child... though they say dreaming of digging up a radish is the best.\"\n\"Pfft, something like that? I just had one, so what?\"\n\"...?\" <191>\nThe girl just glanced sideways, looking displeasedly at the boy. Sukmyŏng, however, seemed captivated only by her luscious hair, rambling on about his dream while watching her.\nSuddenly, the girl lifted her eyes, shining like ripe wild grapes, and observed Sukmyŏng calmly.\n\"Hey, sell me that dream,\" she said with a grin.\n\"Pfft, you want to buy it?\"\nSukmyŏng also smiled broadly, moved.\n\"Yes, I'll buy it—what should I give you?\"\n\"The price for a dream like that? Since it's you, I'll give it for free.\"\n\"But if it has no price, it can't become my dream. Here, take this. Don't refuse it just because it's something I wore.\"\nThe girl, holding her skirt hem with one hand, reached in and untied the silk waistband she wore around her waist, offering it to him.\nSukmyŏng, his heart fluttering, silently snatched the waistband with a rough grasp. It was a moment both deeply moving and startlingly brusque. The girl, though her heart pounded, simply smiled sweetly, standing under the tree for a long while.\n\"You must visit here again later. I'll be waiting. Hey, tell me your name, or at least your hometown.\"\nHis reserve seemed to vanish as Sukmyŏng grew excited.\n\"Yes, I'll come. Depending on the ginseng haul... how happy I'd be if I dig up a few roots—thanks to your dream...\"\nShe smiled gently.\n\"A boy asking for a name so freely... I'm Sŏbunnyŏ. My hometown is far away, Hyŏngje Mudŏm Kol (Brother's Grave Valley).\"\n\"Don't forget me, Sŏbunnyŏ!\"\n\"Okay, you too!\"\nFeeling mutually awkward and shy, they turned their faces away and hurried off in opposite directions.\nThe next day, the *simmani* left.\n\nFrom then on, Sukmyŏng's heart felt as though it had shed its old shell and entered a new world. He seemed to have grasped all mysteries at once, but when the initial excitement subsided, sorrow began to sprout in the following moment. Awake or asleep, Sukmyŏng waited only for their return.\nHowever, ten days, twenty days, nearly a month passed, but the *simmani* he sought never returned. The lush vegetation grew sparse, and occasional snow flurries danced on the harsh, gusting winds of the changing season. Yet, Sukmyŏng remained bound by the same anguish, his heart constricted.\nThe root of the matter was an extremely simple event arising from carelessness, <192> but now, his regret was immense. To have merely excited an innocent person... why make a promise that wouldn't be kept...? As if he couldn't live without the young man, only the sad consequence of a heart sliced and withered remained. The wound, digging deep into his heart, inevitably took root. The silk ribbon (명주띠) appeared vividly before his eyes, her bright face, sparkling eyes, delicate lips... tears welled up in his pitiful state. Who knew the silk ribbon would become a handkerchief for his tears.\nYet, he couldn't confide in his father. Enduring the agony of a burning heart while sitting alone in the mountains seemed beyond his strength.\nHe would sit slumped on a mountain ridge, gazing blankly at the wide-open sky. He would take his bow and roam the ridges, chasing blameless animals. He would lie in his room for days without moving, seemingly trying to sleep away his troubles like Sotaesŏng (a figure known for stubbornness?). He would take out the *changgi* board and flip it over violently. But none of these actions soothed the wound within.\nAround *Kyŏngch'ip* (the Awakening of Insects), when even the ice in the shaded areas began to melt, one day Sukmyŏng, having stopped hunting, found himself gazing endlessly at the mountain pass Sŏbunnyŏ had crossed when she left. The memory of that night by the well under the birch tree, when she promised to return, felt intensely real. Every stone, every blade of grass, every tree seemed imbued with affection because of the girl, becoming objects of poignant memory he had never felt before.\nTossing his bow aside, Sukmyŏng set off to find the girl, estimating the path by the ridge she had looked back from several times as she crossed. But after walking ten *ri*, then another twenty, doubling back and searching, he found only endless ranges of mountains and valleys (山壑); not even a familiar landmark was in sight. Utterly disheartened and limp, he turned back, having gained nothing but blistered feet.\nAs spring deepened, Sukmyŏng's anticipation for the female monk's arrival suddenly renewed. Yes, the nun would come on Buddha's Birthday. If she came, perhaps she would take pity on him, grant his wish, maybe even guide him to Sŏbunnyŏ. Even this remote hope lightened his heart considerably, making it feel refreshed. The future suddenly seemed bright, and feeling the purpose of the mountain life for the first time in a long while, he cheerfully attended to household chores.\nBut Buddha's Birthday did not arrive quickly. The saying \"No calendar in the mountains\" (山中無曆日) felt untrue; counting the days on his fingers, the thawing wind seemed perpetually cold. Catkins budded on the sprawling willow branches by the stream, and the late-spring cold snap (꽃샘바람) sweeping through the mountains along the stream felt chilly even as azaleas and forsythia bloomed. <193>\nAs time passed, the mountains turned properly green. A cuckoo came morning and evening to the birch tree by the well, flicking its tail like a winnowing fan as it cried.\nThe day before the day before Buddha's Birthday (四月八日), Sukmyŏng had roughly finished plowing the terraced fields. Hoping the nun might rest there, he thoroughly cleaned the area around his hut. He swept the yard, cleared the path, and spread fresh yellow earth. He gathered choice wild greens like bellflowers, bracken, and fatsia shoots as delicacies and prepared them. Even if it was just coarse barley rice, he had enough for a meal, which was sufficient. He planned to welcome the female monk and offer her food.\nOne day, two days passed. When the day finally arrived, Sukmyŏng, his eyes gritty from a sleepless night, ran the tens of *ri* of mountain path early in the morning. Believing the nun's figure might faintly appear in the mist, he stood firmly on the rocky scree slope, his gaze fixed intently on the valley where the grave was, the place he had met her on this day last year.\n\nAs expected, around noon, the nun came to the grave. Surprisingly, it was the female monk who seemed moved, greeting the young man with pleasure. Living secluded in the mountains must be so arduous; how much must she long for the civilized towns? But suffering is endless everywhere in this world, so it's better to hope for paradise in the next life, she said, and their conversation flowed amicably. Sukmyŏng, tears welling up in sorrow, confessed truthfully his lack of anywhere to turn and the great pain in his heart caused by the girl. He stated his wish was to find the girl, no matter how much he had to suffer or exert himself.\nHe implored her outright to take him in, declaring he could no longer bear not finding the girl. The nun found his desperate earnestness touching, but she merely listened intently, remaining silent for a long while. Then,\n\"Discard all such worldly afflictions. When you think about it, human life is merely transient (無常)... Being born and dying is fundamentally futile, so why intentionally seek suffering? Especially, how many men ruin their bodies and spoil their entire lives because of women? Youth itself becomes a sin, and the day one transgresses, the punishment the soul receives for the body's atonement is eternal. Though youth is cruel, the pain is temporary... why prematurely embrace sorrow? Let me tell you an old story...\" <194> Then, the nun sighed deeply and began the following tale.\n\nIt was also a deep mountain valley. For long ages, the stream flowing directly beneath the main peak eroded the mountain valley (山壑), its clear water sounds echoing under scree slopes and cliff bases. The mist, slowly licking the rounded boulders, crept along the stream, spreading and dispersing through the valley.\nThus, the valley embraced the stream, and the mountain moved, enveloped in mist. And along the moving stream and mountain slopes, people occasionally settled, trying to live beyond the extremely primitive life. Among such people lived two brothers. Bound by an uncommon fraternal love, the older brother cherished the younger one dearly, and the younger brother supported the older, finding purpose in their mountain life.\nThen came a moment when, driven by the conflict of desire, the older brother killed the younger. In that instant, the older brother's reason (理知) crumbled completely, like a building struck by a powerful earthquake.\nWhat possessed him to harm his brother? Even if he feigned the actions of a madman, there was no excuse to wash away the terrifying crime of patricide—or rather, fratricide. Even if he lacked the nagging pangs of conscience, this enraged man might have lived on like an animal.\nBut having impulsively committed the act according to his rash temper (보짱머리), driven by covetousness without regard for means, conscience indeed stepped forward with a whip. Perhaps because he was human after all, he was this weak.\nOne way or another, the older brother killed the younger. Over the affections concerning a single woman. And it wasn't just any killing, but a chilling murder (斫殺). With a keenly sharpened sickle, he struck his brother's side in a single blow, felling him. Too great a tragedy had resulted from a trivial matter.\nThe brothers, born like the wind in the deep mountains... their lives, born in nature and entrusted to it, were modest yet cozy. The younger brother, possessing a simple heart, followed his older brother daily to the distant mountains to chop wood, their sole skill. That day too, after eating porridge made with bellflowers, they had set out. The late autumn scenery was exquisitely beautiful; the mountains and fields were dyed myriad colors (萬紫千紅) with autumn leaves. The younger brother's heart was simply dazzled, because the promise of the young lady (소저) who had rested her head on his chest the night before, pledging under the moon, was vivid in his eyes. Her precious <195> image, promising to live long together, have sons and daughters, and enjoy wealth and honor, kept resurfacing.\nThe mountains, rivers, trees, and plants all seemed created for them; everything was a symbol of tender love. Only happiness seemed to await him in his radiant future.\n\"Let's build our nest before autumn ends. She's my only intended mate; surely brother wouldn't interfere? Even if he did, what could stop me? I have strong arms and legs. The young lady knows how to weave mats. We can just leave.\"\nWith such thoughts, the younger brother, bending over, swung his tool to clear brushwood with vigorous skill.\nThe day was clear and endlessly high. Yet even under such a warm sky, the older brother felt trapped, as if his chest (명문) would burst. Standing or sitting, his eyes rolled back in his head, anger seething within him. As he saw it, the young lady was clearly his. Though he hadn't secured a commitment, he had confessed his love to her long ago, and she should have come to him. Yet she seemed always devoted only to her weaving (길삼질), showing no intention of marrying him. Unbeknownst to him, it seemed the younger brother had won her affection, leaving him like a dog that had chased a chicken—jilted. Misinterpreting the situation out of affection, the older brother was tempted to the brink of shuddering resolve.\n\"Just get rid of the younger brother. Then the young lady is like a rabbit already caught.\"\nThis outlandish whisper of the devil made his heart pound like a hammer (두방맹이질). Without time to reconsider, his mind, simple in its thinking, decided to eliminate his brother, and his method was cruel.\nClutching his sprawled-out brother, stunned by the eternally irreversible mistake of his life, he felt his consciousness overturn. Though the gruesome scene was momentary, the crimson blood spread into the dark earth of the deserted mountain, as if to speak of the indelible sin for ages to come. The already blood-red autumn leaves, catching the sunset glow (夕照), made the ten thousand valleys and peaks (萬壑千峰) seem entirely drenched in blood, scattered (냥자하기) beyond measure.\nHolding his blood-soaked, sprawled brother, the older brother stared at the sky for half a day, his expression hardened like rock. As the initial excitement subsided and his actions transformed into the consciousness of sin, he vaguely sensed that sin entails punishment, feeling the unwritten laws of human morality. His face took on a look of remorse. Doubt, jealousy, and hope vanished from his empty heart, replaced by overwhelming pure affection—fraternal love (同氣愛). The extremity of love, true love—it was death. Supreme love and supreme death—that would atone (속상하고) for all sins and more. <196>\nDeath brings resolution to all things, he thought. The older brother raised the blood-stained sickle to slit his own belly, intending to follow his brother whom he had sent ahead.\nBut the older brother remained an irresolute fellow to the end. Ultimately, clutching the wound (傷創) in his belly, he gathered medicinal herbs—a folk remedy—applied them, and began digging a grave. He intended to conduct a mountain funeral (산영장). He fashioned a straw effigy (제웅) like his own corpse and buried it with his own hands.\nWhen the substantial grave mound was complete, the younger brother's body was laid out before it, arranged as if in a painting.\nThe villagers who discovered the older brother's grave and the younger brother's corpse inferred a story of noble fraternal love: \"The older brother was cutting wood in a brushwood patch. The younger brother, running towards that spot, sensed movement in the arrowroot vines (칙넌줄). Mistaking it for an animal like a deer, he struck with his sickle, only to find it was his brother. Overcome with shame and grief at losing his sibling, the younger brother buried his brother carefully and then atoned for his sin with death in front of the grave.\" Thus, the Brother's Grave came into being, and this valley was named Hyŏngje Mudŏm Kol (형제무덤골 - Brother's Grave Valley) in their honor.\nHowever, fate's tricks (作戱) were persistently cruel. The following spring (잇해 봄), the older brother unexpectedly (표현히) appeared before the young lady. By then, the young lady, having given birth to the younger brother's child, had become a utterly helpless (허잘것없는) figure, completely abandoned by those around her. As if that weren't enough, the older brother appeared, took away the younger brother's child, adding that burden to her woes, and then abruptly entered monastic life (出家). As punishment, the older brother was separated from his child. Sometime later, the young lady carried her husband's bones in a willow box, transferring them to a temple path to soothe his aggrieved spirit (면레).\nAnd so, every year on Buddha's Birthday, a certain nun unfailingly visits that grave, tends the mound (보로를 하고), scatters flowers, and prays for her husband's repose. She is none other than the young lady, the only person who fully knows (지숙하는) the sad legend of this Brother's Grave, brought about by her own naive self, unable to manage the rift she caused between the brothers due to misplaced affection. Having lived meaninglessly, she embarked on the path of mountain asceticism to atone for the sins of a sorrowful world.\nHaving related this story, the nun concluded,\n\"It was the sin of the naive young lady's pure heart, unable to cope between the brothers, splitting their bond due to affections she didn't realize were cruel. A single misstep can easily ruin a lifetime. Please, you too, beware of women. *Namu Amit'a Pul*...\"\nFinishing her words, the nun heaved a long sigh. <197>\nAfter hearing the nun's story, Sukmyŏng's heart pounded anew, not so much from the sad legend of the brothers, but because he wondered if the valley named Hyŏngje Mudŏm Kol might be the hometown the girl had mentioned.\n\"Nun-nim, where exactly is Hyŏngje Mudŏm Kol?\"\nSukmyŏng asked insistently, his face extremely tense.\n\"Why do you ask?\"\nThe nun, too, was considerably flustered, seeming wary of something from the start.\n\"No, it's just... it's the place I've longed to see, awake or asleep. I know affections can be cruel, but I wondered if it might be the place Sŏbunnyŏ said she lived...\"\n\"Sŏbunnyŏ?\"\n\"Sŏbunnyŏ! The very girl who promised to return!\"\n\"...If that's truly the case... Seventy *ri* down from here is Wŏlch'ul Kol (月出谷), and seventy *ri* west from there, Hyŏngje Mudŏm Kol should be found.\"\nThe nun's eyes shone, seemingly with pity. What was it about this girl Sŏbunnyŏ that caused the young man to be so obsessed (미망이저서) and tormented? Considering his anguish, it seemed no ordinary affection, so she couldn't carelessly reprimand him. Perhaps due to a sudden, vague memory surfacing unexpectedly,\n\"Young man, how old are you?\"\nThe nun spoke up.\n\"Nineteen!\"\n\"Nineteen?\"\nRepeating the young man's answer, the nun felt her voice tremble uncontrollably.\n\"Your father? Your mother?\"\nThough she seemed to ask casually, deliberately looking into the air, the nun's eyes were strangely filled with anxiety.\n\"Nun-nim, I told you several times, it's just my father.\"\n\"Yes, yes. Truly, one becomes meddlesome with age. Where did you say you live with your father?\"\n\"I've repeated it several times—we live in Sinsŏn Kol, thirty *ri* from here. Though our place is humble, I made preparations with utmost sincerity hoping to host you, Nun-nim. Please stay for one night...\"\nHowever, the nun, staring intently once more at the speaking young man's face, seemed drained by a terrifying memory, as if she might collapse on the spot. She barely managed to tremble to her feet, hesitating for a moment. Her resolve was evident as she steeled herself, determinedly overcoming something. <198>\nThus, the nun refused Sukmyŏng's persistent invitation and started down the steep slope, shuddering at the cruel twist of fate (宿命).\n\"They say even brushing sleeves with a passerby creates a bond in this life... Please, come again next spring on Buddha's Birthday.\"\nThe nun muttered in a trembling voice, then turned back again, shaking her pewter staff.\n\"Nun-nim! Definitely, right here...\"\nSukmyŏng, grateful for the nun's words, smiled broadly, but then his nose suddenly stung with tears.\nHe sat there for a while longer, then finally got up. What was so great about seeing that nun again anyway? His only thought was to get to Hyŏngje Mudŏm Kol quickly.\nSeventy *ri* from Wŏlch'ul Kol meant a total of one hundred forty *ri*—wasn't that just a day's journey for hunting? Sukmyŏng whistled excitedly as he returned to Sinsŏn Kol.\n\nSukmyŏng, having spent a sleepless night, hurried his preparations at dawn, wrapping his leggings and tying his shoe laces. It was Hyŏngje Mudŏm Kol he longed to see, even if just for a glimpse.\nHe mumbled something vague to his father about going hunting, took his bow, and quietly left the house at dawn.\nCrossing the stream by boat, he ran recklessly (천방지축), stepping into voids, guided only by eye estimate (눈어방) towards the faint blue mountains of Wŏlch'ul Kol visible through the mist. The stream flowed endlessly along the deep gorge. Crossing the stream and cutting through the marshy alder grove led to another gentle slope, which then stretched out like a bull's back, connecting to the endlessly high main peak. Beyond such mountains and ridges, piling up layer upon layer, lay Wŏlch'ul Kol.\nThough initially disoriented, once he arrived, he recognized it with pleasure, recalling a time he had gotten lost while hunting, seemingly bewitched by a mountain spirit (山魅), and received help at some house in this area.\nHe filled his empty stomach with leftover rice (대궁) at the familiar mountain hut, and then, racing against the sun setting in the western sky, he pushed on along the rough mountain path without a thought for his worn-out shoes. When hungry, he simply plucked and chewed the abundant wild greens; the cold spring water flowing from the rocks was sweet and refreshing.\nAs roughly estimated, his hurried journey brought him to Hyŏngje Mudŏm Kol just as the sun was setting. It was easier than he had first thought. The setting sun's rays turned into a red glow (놀), bathing the mountains and valleys, making the whole world seem scorched (끄슬릴듯) red. The village itself was enveloped in silence. <199>\nSlash-and-burn farming seemed to be the staple here too; patches of burned fields dotted the green mountainsides, making the scorched ridges look desolate (숭업다). Clinging to the steep mountain farms were shanty-like huts—one on this ridge, one opposite, another isolated beyond the pass. Although these were the makeshift homes of transient people who moved with the burned fields, to Sukmyŏng, it appeared as a considerable settlement (繁榮).\nHis heart raced ahead, but he had no clear plan (묘리) for what to do about Sŏbunnyŏ. He didn't know which house was hers, and with not even an ant stirring, there was no one to ask such personal questions. Standing there bewildered, his heart just pounded violently.\nSince he had resolved not to return to Sinsŏn Kol if he couldn't meet Sŏbunnyŏ, deciding he might as well die, he found courage he didn't know he had. Why hesitate? Dusk had already fallen (떵검의진후). There was no need to rush. He discreetly found a spot on the mountainside to wait for nightfall and observe the village.\nThe crescent moon cast a faint, eerie blue shadow. Amidst the harsh croaking of frogs, a dog barked persistently (꽁꽁), sounding as if it would bark until dawn. The familiar cry of the *chŏptong새* (cuckoo) sounded unusually affectionate.\nDozing off, nodding (근덕근덕), he would startle awake, finding only faint stars twinkling in the sky. Suddenly, realizing his utterly worthless (허잘나위없는) state, tears welled up as loneliness washed over him. It seemed he was just pointlessly tormenting himself; his legs ached, and his head throbbed...\nGathering his exhausted body, nearly collapsing (까불어질듯), he resolved that he must meet Sŏbunnyŏ. Straining, he staggered (어칠어칠) down the slope. He had to find Sŏbunnyŏ's house first. But strangely, even the few shabby huts (오돌막집) he had seen showed no sign of lamplight; they were all dead silent. Having noted their location earlier, he approached one, but the crude dwelling seemed ominous. Taken aback (뜨가한채), fear suddenly gripped him. What on earth was going on with every house like this? He hurried his steps and ran up to the ridge crest.\nBeyond the pass, it was bustling with activity. Lights shone brightly inside and outside a house. Little children chattered, adults shouted noisily, and the sound of rice cakes being pounded echoed resoundingly through the surrounding mountains.\nCrossing the ditch stream, he reached the edge of a vegetable garden. The smell of oil from frying pancakes (부침개질) wafted through the air, irritating Sukmyŏng's famished stomach. He could guess the reason why people had gathered from their homes, <200>\n\"Hey, what's happening at this house?\"\nHe grabbed a girl carrying a baby on her back and asked bluntly, without dignity (채신이없이).\n\"A feast, what else?\"\nThinking the girl was sharp-tongued, Sukmyŏng asked again.\n\"A feast? Whose feast is it?\"\n\"Sŏbunnyŏ's feast, whose else could it be?\"\n\"Sŏbunnyŏ?\"\nIt felt like a bolt from the blue; Sukmyŏng's head spun.\n\"You're funny, don't you know Sŏbunnyŏ from this house? Tomorrow the new groom comes jingling (왈랑절랑) on his horse, and Sŏbunnyŏ goes off in a palanquin to get married.\"\nThe little girl paid him no further attention, turning away while chattering playfully to the baby on her back.\nAs if stunned, Sukmyŏng stumbled forward a few steps, then suddenly felt the support under his heart give way. He threw himself down on the slope at his feet. Utterly drained, he stared blankly at the moon, hot tears streaming down his cheeks. Licking the salty tears from his lips, Sukmyŏng eventually scrambled up and walked aimlessly along the stream.\nThere was no conceivable plan (계교), so his thoughts were simple, his emotions dulled. Consequently, the means he considered to execute those thoughts were extremely clumsy.\nHis foolish, reckless (오독깝스런) idea was to charge in headlong, strike down those fellows, snatch Sŏbunnyŏ, and run off with her. But could he really attempt such a thing rashly? Did he even have the strength? If he fought with desperate resolve, perhaps the task wouldn't be impossible. Yet, the thought didn't quite sit right.\nAfter mulling over various ideas, the cleverest plan he could devise was this: the next day, the new groom would arrive grandly on horseback to claim the girl. Then he would carry Sŏbunnyŏ away. He would wait for their return journey and give them trouble then. A couple of arrows would surely send that fellow tumbling from his horse! Sukmyŏng found it impossible to sleep.\nJust as he drifted into a light sleep, loud \"Thump, thump...\" sounds echoing from somewhere jolted him awake. It was the sound of the gold prospectors' dynamite, the same sound that had greatly disturbed his nerves back in Sinsŏn Kol. Waking fully, he realized the sound this time was surprisingly loud, seeming very close. It was the encroachment of civilization, digging into the age-old secrets of the mountains.\nThe next morning, Sukmyŏng climbed a high mountain peak, intending to locate the source of the previous night's sounds. Since it was deep within the mountains <201> he couldn't pinpoint it. Yet, Sukmyŏng felt an impulse, as if pulling back some curtain in these vast mountains would reveal a mysterious wonder (경의). He felt a sudden urge to run towards that dynamite sound.\nHe would take Sŏbunnyŏ and go find that strange place, he thought. Lost in these thoughts, he realized it was already past mid-morning; the bright sunlight (볕) spread unhindered, even into the deep mountain gorge.\nSome distance from the village, he hid himself at the base of a pine tree beside a large rock on the roadside that wound around the ridge (서드리). Unknown mountain flowers bloomed profusely, bathing him in their rich fragrance.\nAfter waiting for some time, the wedding procession (新行) came around the foot of the mountain. Unable to see the lovely face of Sŏbunnyŏ inside the palanquin, Sukmyŏng felt consumed with impatience (애가 씨여). He took out the silk waistband Sŏbunnyŏ had left him, pressed it to his cheek, and felt a lump rise in his throat.\nWiping his eyes, he looked again. The procession drew closer right in front of him. The groom was short and stubby (단작맞아 졸짝한 붓배기키), riding a mangy donkey, walking with short steps (초속초속)—a rather petty sight (잔망굿기도하다). Furthermore, the attendants (후행) were quite a spectacle: one wore a broken (파치난) *kat* tilted sideways, looking utterly exhausted already from following the donkey's pace.\nKnocking down such a small-minded fellow (좀스런 화상) would be a piece of cake (생치쌈에 식은밥 먹기) with a single arrow.\nSukmyŏng's eyes widened (걷어질려). \"Hey you! Leave Sŏbunnyŏ here right now, you can't take her!\"\nHe roared this command only in his heart. In reality, his arrow was already aimed away from the target (관혁박이). Gripping the bow handle (활숨통), he drew the string taut and released it. The arrow left the string, tore through the empty air, and flew high, high up.\nHolding the bow in one arm, Sukmyŏng stumbled down, grasping at the bushes with his other hand. Mountain flowers scattered profusely (냥자하니) onto the nape of his neck.\nThrough his tear-blurred vision, the wedding procession, bells jingling (쩔렁쩔렁), moved dizzily. He collapsed onto the rock, weeping uncontrollably. -(End)-<202>\n<186-202>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis short story, \"Mountain Flower,\" follows Sukmyŏng, a young man living an isolated, primitive life with his withdrawn father in the Korean mountains during the colonial era. His world expands first through an encounter with a mysterious female Buddhist nun, and then significantly through meeting Sŏbunnyŏ, a girl with a group of ginseng collectors. Sukmyŏng falls deeply in love with Sŏbunnyŏ, who promises to return but doesn't. A year later, driven by longing, he seeks guidance from the nun, who tells him a tragic story connected to Sŏbunnyŏ's supposed hometown, Hyŏngje Mudŏm Kol. Sukmyŏng journeys there, only to find Sŏbunnyŏ is marrying someone else the next day. Witnessing her wedding procession, he is overcome with despair and ultimately unable to act, firing his arrow harmlessly into the sky as the sounds of nearby mining explosions punctuate his heartbreak.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, the story offers insights into the stark contrast between isolated, traditional mountain life (slash-and-burn farming, reliance on nature, folk beliefs) and the encroaching modernity represented by the gold prospectors' dynamite explosions (남포소리), symbolizing resource extraction under colonial rule. The characters' fatalism, the theme of inescapable fate (宿命), and the descriptions of poverty and hardship in the remote countryside reflect the social conditions and perhaps the psychological impact of the era on marginalized communities. The nun's tragic backstory involving betrayal and atonement adds a layer of traditional Korean narrative themes.\n\n**Named Entities**\n\n石仁海\t석인해\tSŏk

숙명의 부자였다. 세상과는 도무지 인연을끊은채 구그로 산발에 화전이나 일쿠어가며 낟알이라고 뿌려두면 그게 염구는대로 걷우어드렸고 도라지, 더덕, 머루, 다래, 도토리 그런 지천으로있는 멧과실이며 나물로 끼니를 때는 극히 원시적인 생활이였다.\n무엇으로 연유해서 산생활인지 숙명이는 그런것따질 엄두도 아니생길것이 조마구 빨며부터 어우렁더우렁 산에 기뜰어 산의습성(習性)에 얽매인 그들이였다.\n아버지는 졸연해 말이 없었다. 핏기질린 얼굴이 헐쑥하고 어깨가 푹 욱으러든 고림보여서, 임을 오므리고 골골하니 벽을않고 누었기가 아니면, 가랄진 구메논밭에 주저앉아 곡식을 다틀뿐, 세상물정을 멀리한채 그건 완구히 은둔생활이였다.\n아는이없음에 찾아올이 없고, 그닷하게아쉬운 물건이 없음에 세상과 교섭이 필요없었다. 사박스런 세태에 다슬러지지않는 숙명이는 오로지 아버지를 딸아 수럭수럭 일만알았고, 그좁은 세상에서 처지대로 살아왔으며, 그걸 괴로워 할줄도 모른채 산협을 천지의 전부만 역였다.\n따라서 제물에 자연의 습성을 그대로본받아 풍속을 일렀고, 산과 화(和)하고 섭슬려 소박할망정 든든하고 풍성스런 생명력을 키여서, 멫짐숭을 적수로 젓고틀고 활을 쏙아 쫓닐어 오금을

겨의(驚異)와 불안이 막아섰었다. 바로 작년 이무렵이였다. 역시 메로 나온것은 사냥을 하잠인데 어대선지 난데없이 폭음(爆音)이 울려왔다. 가슴을 멍멍히 울리는 그런 커다란 음향이였다. 금맥(金脈)을 따라단니는 금쟁이외 남포소리였건만 숙명이는 정신이 떠름해, 그것을 해아릴도리가 없었기에 그는 분격에타는 눈자위를 뒤굴리며 그음향과 겨르랴 산을 몇이나넘고 뛰고 쏘댓것만 끝내는 헛물만 켜고 돌아오든 길에 공칙히 한 여승(女僧)을 만나섰다.\n석장(錫杖)을 끌고 가사장삼에 고깔을쓰고 바랑을메인 중이였다. 후미진 언덕밑에 잣다란 무덤이 있었고, 간해에 욱어젔든 잡초에 싸여 어설푸고 초라한 무덤인데, 중은 풀을뜯고 산화(山花)를 다발로 꺾어다 고였고, 중은 단정히 꿀고앉아 염주를 헤여가며 무덤주인의 명복(暝福)을 빌고있었다. 그린듯이 눈을감고 생각에 잠착한채 언제이고 눈을 뜨는일이없든 중은, 이윽고 고요히 머리를 들고일어서며 숙명이와 눈길이 마주치자 무안중이다 저윽히 당혹해하는 눈치였으나 내심 경게는 하면서도 침착스런 몸가짐이였다. 중은 도끼눈으로 숙명이를 흘기드니,\n「심산속에 어인 사람인고?」\n목소래도 여무젔다.\n「신밖을 모르는 두멧백성이오」\n숙명이는 한자국 와락 다가서며 대꾸를 했다. 대거리를 하며보니 이중이 남정이아니오 여인인것을 찾아낸때 숙명이의가슴은 괸스리 뛰였다.\n「웨 남자 숭내를 냈오?」\n하고 숙명이는 의뭉스레 구슬르자 숭은 급작스리 깔끄러운 눈초리가 되드니,\n「어인 젊은네가 무람없이……」\n말낫도 분명히 주어티드니, 그만 휙 돌아서 물미가급한 언덕빼기로 나리딛였다. 사십안팎의 살피죽 좋은 여인의 모양은 어딘지 모르게 아릿다운태가 넉넉했다.\n「무무한 백성이라 허물조차 없으리까, 산은 너무 고박허니 밝은천지를 아르켜 줍시사구……」\n숙명이는 숭의 앞에 슬기를 다내 무릅을 꿀으며 애원했다. 햇더니 여승은 몇 번이고 바재이다,＜188＞\n「나 역시 사파를 피해난몸, 어떻게 남의 의표가 되리오, 두메에서 처지대루 사다 내년봄 이날에 다시

달바위에서 껙껙 울던 수꿩이 숙명이가 몸을 웅숭그린 솔포기새로 깃을 쭉 뻗고 드리 닥드리는게였다.\n숙명은 활줌통을 쥐고 살을꿰어 시위를 활짝 팔맜다. 헌데 화살은 푸른창공을 찢고 꼬리를치며 나는게였다. 까투리의 가랑가랑한 목소리로만 알고, 주검의 구렁으로 꾀여드는 수꿩! 숙명은 참아 그붉은가슴에 살을 박을수는 없었다.\n눈을들어 살이 떨어지는곳을 살피랴니 버드나무 늘어선 수풀이였다. 역시 누런꾀꼬리가 오르락내리락 우짖는게였다.\n「날 누굴누굴!」\n암놈이 쓱 안도라지게 얼러 놀말이면,\n「날 날……」\n수놈이 풍찌고 으레껏 멋가락으로 받아넘기도는, 제바람에 섭슬려가지고 엎치락뒤치락 산천이야 메라던 그건 얼마나 파겁이못된 숙명의 낯을 붉히게하드냐? 한것 맹랑스러우며도 한긋 마음을 개운케하는 정경이였다.\n여승이 찔러놓고간 불만싶었다. 소년 열아홉이건 수시 두메산골에서 자랐기에 망정이지 엄부렁총각 구실일것이다. 게다 숙명이는 소박할대로소박은하나 걸대가 커다랗고 걱센게 끼끗했다.\n숙명은 어느곁에 자라서 어룬이된듯, 우주의비밀＜189＞을 겁네는법없이 소락소락 뒤지게였다. 그건 인생이 성장하는 법측이랄게다.\n어느새 지실치못한 아버지따위 무어 신신찮은 존재였다. 그렇게 애끼고 위하든때는 언제라고, 늙어빠저 추레하고 구중중한꼴이 주체스레만 뵜다.\n자식이 날로 살이 빠저 성벽만 부리게마련이고 뽀롱뽀롱 생매새끼처럼 오돌저가는모양이 아버지에겐 못마땅했다. 한시가 새롭다고 주름살이 늘어가는듯, 수족은 지치고 앞일이 난감스러움에 꺼진줄만역였든 쓰라린 과거가 새삼스레 떠오르고했다.\n세상을 피해난까닭은 제몸을 시달리고 괴롭힘으로서 인생의실패에대한 죄의대갚음을 하랴든것이였고, 그것도 변변한일이나 됬어도몰을것을 한 개 계집으로해서 평생을 잡첬다는 그슬픔생애를 더는 벌할거리가 없었든것이다.\n그러나 인생이 생장하는 법측은 무서운가보아, 유축없이 제갈길을 서두르기에 숙명이게는 숨글수없는 커단힘이 무럭무럭 자라는게였고, 아무리 잡도리를 하기로 젊은생령을 사로잡는수는 없었다.\n\n그해 백로(白露)무렵이였다. 계절이 민감한 단풍나무잎에 가을빛이 재바르게 기뜨릴때, 이산속으로 심메를하는 심만이(採蔘人)들이 우둥우둥 밀려들었다. 노인도노인이려니와 숙명의놀람이 더켰든것이다 지금까지 그러한 심만이들이 어쩌다가 지내처간일이 두간하지만, 정갈하게 몸을꿈인남정네들이였었다 헌데 그 어설픈 오막살이속에 난생처음인 야릇한 향기를 느꼈으니 그건 열피리처럼 여낙낙한 계집애였든것이다.\n삼을캐랴거든 그런 계집애따위는 부정을 탄다지만, 산에서 산으로 이동하는 뜨내기 신세래서 일을테면 채삼으로 생화를 삼는 그런떼였다.\n산막에서 자고나는 아침드리 심만이들은 무성한 숲이며 새를헤치고 지성껏 치성을 드리어 산신을 위하였고, 메투리에 들메를 매고 메를타랴 흐터지는게였다.\n은가루를 뿌린듯싶은 숲의 이슬을 털고 잠자리를 뜬 큰짐승(범, 곰, 이리따위)의 자취를 본다치도, 산신의두호를 믿는 심만이들은 조금치나 두려울것은없어 심메기에만 골독하는게였다.\n메를타다 돌아올라치면 고달픈몸을 산막에 눕힌채 한밤을두고 길몽(吉夢)얻기에 골몰하다. 꿈을억기위해 잠을청하는 푼수였다. 그런날과 그런밤이 몇 번이고 뒤바뀌든 어는밤이였다.＜190＞\n추석머리를 잡아드는 달무리조차 선 그런밤이였다. 만뢰(萬籟)는 잠드러 잠잠한데, 푸른달그림자는 윈 메와골짜구니를 포근히덮어, 산은 더욱높고 숲은 웅웅깊은데, 어느멫발끝에서 부엉이가 울어 산이만큼을 알리고있고, 어느숲속에서 접동새우름이 겻질러 들리어오는 그러한 쓸쓸한밤이 이슥히 깊어만가는데, 숙명이는 슬픗 한잠이 든가했드니, 윈 멫발이 소내기에 통이 웨싸이고 그렇게 노박이로퍼붓는가 했더니, 적은듯해 날은들고 채색무지개가 이쪽 우물에서 재넘엣 우물에다 다리를 놓은듯 눈이부시게 현란하면서도 고대 손에 잽힐듯 아름다웠다.\n그렇게 아름다운 무지개이기에 넋을 놓고 직히노라니 문득 채색다리를 딧고하늘로하늘로 달리는 초립동이를 바랐다. 그초립동이는 어짜자고 다따가에 숙명이자신으로 뒤바뀌는양, 숙명이는 허방을 드디며 건공으로 날다말고 소스라처 깨고보니 맹랑스런 꿈이였다.\n그거 싱겁다고 숙명이는 지게문을 밀고 밖으로 나왔다. 구름자락에서 삐여지는 달빛이 가슴에 한아름 안겼다. 그는 가락나무밑에서 참았던 오줌을 갈기고 섰노라니 맞은편 우물가에 희끄무레하니 드러나는 그림자가 삼캐려온 그소녀가 분명했다.\n숙명이는 멈씰하고 거름을 멈추자니 가슴이 설레임을 느끼었다. 나무등걸에 기대여서서 한참을 엿을 보자니까, 그림자는 그린듯 다소곳이 우물가에 섰었다. 숙명이는 한참을 무춤거리다가 불쑥 발길을 옮겼다.\n「너, 게서 멋하늬?」\n소녀옆으로 다가스며 무중 물었을때, 소녀는 소스라처 몸을틀며 수집은듯 탐스러운 머리꼬리만 만지작거리드니\n「아이 깜짝이야 난 또 누구라구, 좋은꿈을줍시사구 산신님께 발괄을 하든참이란다」\n소녀는 살폿이 웃고, 산신이 벗나면 꿈도 아니주시는데 삼캐기는 만무라고 그런말까지를 덧얹어 얼러준다.\n「꿈? 그까짓 꿈해서 멋하늬?」\n「심메보리문 우선 좋은꿈을 보얀단다」\n「어떤꿈이 좋으냐?」\n「꿈도 가지각생이지, 돼지를 본다든가 동자꿈을 뀐다든가……허긴 무를 캐어보는게 그중이라드라」\n「피, 그런거, 난 금방 뀌구난걸, 머」\n「………?」＜191＞\n소녀는 눈만 할기죽 흘기고 못마땅한듯이 소년을 쏘아볼때, 숙명이는 탐스런 머리채에만 정신인가보아, 야볼야볼 꿈이야기를 털어노며 소녀를 직힌다.\n했더니 소녀는 문득 머루알같이 윤기흐르는눈을 들어 고즈넉이 숙명이를 살피고는\n「이얘, 너 그꿈을 팔아라」\n하고 해죽거리며 말했다.\n「피, 늬가 살랴?」\n숙명이도 감격스레 벌씬 웃었다.\n「그래 내가 사마-무엇을 주랴?」\n「그까짓 꿈값은, 너니 그저 준다」\n「그래두 값이없으문 내꿈이 못되잖늬, 자, 이걸받아라 내몸에 띠든거래서 싫어말구」\n소녀는 든손 치맛자락을여미고 손을넣어 허리에 둘렀든 명주허리띠를 글러주었다.\n숙명이는 느물거리는마음에 쩍 말없이 띠를 뺐듯이 왁쌀스런 팔로 움켰다. 그건 너무 감격스러우면도 우왁스런 순간이여서, 소녀는 가슴은 뛰여도 새물새물 웃을뿐 나무밑에 한참을 섰었다.\n「이담에 꼭 여길 들려얀다. 내 기두를게, 얘 네일름이나 대라, 고장이라두 알잤구나」\n시스럼도 가시는듯 숙명이는 열이났다.\n「그래 내 올게, 심메틀 보아, 몇뿌리캐문 오죽반가울가- 네꿈덕이라고……」\n살몃이 웃드니,\n「모슴애가 중업게 이름을 다 캐묻구, 서부녀란다 고장은 먼먼 형제무덤꼴이구」\n「날 잊지말라 서분녀야!」\n「그래, 너두!」\n둘은 그만 계면하고 부끄러워 얼굴을 똘린채 종종거름을 옮기고 말았다.\n이튼날 심만이는 떠나가고.\n다음부터 숙명의가슴속은 묵은 껍질을헐벗고 새세상에 들어선듯, 한거번에 온갖 신비를 알아바렸으나, 그감격이 까라앉을때 다음순간에 괴로움이 싹트는게여서, 숙명이는 자나깨나 그들이 돌아오기만 기둘렀다.\n그러나 여를 수므날 한달장간이 지내도 그들을 찾는 심만이는 다시없은채 무성튼 초목이 홀죽해젔고, 오락가락하는 거치른바람 끝에 눈발도 푸뜩거리는 게절이됐건만, 숙명이는 한결같은 오뇌속에 욱매여 마음을 윽죄이고 있었다.\n일의 꼬투리란게 허허실수로 저질러진 극히 간＜192＞단한것이였으나 이마적은 뉘우침만컸다. 멀정한사람을 설구처만놓고……오지도 않을기약을 둘건 메든고……소년가 아니면 더는 못살듯, 살을 점이고 마음을 여위는 슬픈결과만 남길줄이야, 속속드리 가슴을 파고드는 상처는 점점 자리를 잡게 마련이였다. 영포당기가 눈에삼삼밟히고, 해사한얼굴에 아글아글한눈이랑 연연한 입술이랑 애졸한심정에 눈물만 예려젔다. 명주띠가 눈물씻개가될줄야.\n그렇다고 아버지에게 설파를 하는수는없고, 산속에 오도간히 앉아 애간장이 타는 괴로움을 참기는 힘에 부치는모양이였다.\n퍼벌을한채 멫발에 근더저 휑뎅그령하니 티인 하늘을 바라기도했고, 활을 들고나서 멫발을타고 애꾸진 짐승을 쫓닐으거나, 방속에 누은채 몇일이고 끄덕하는법없이 소대성이 모양으로 잠으로 마는가하면 장기를 들고 부대기를 대구 갈아엎기도 하는게였으나, 어느게라고 앞은상처을 어르만저 주는건 아니였다.\n경칩무렵이되자 응달엣 어름짱도 헤실헤실 풀리든어느날, 숙명이는 사냥을하다말고 문득 서분녀가 떠나가든 그 산마루터기를 언제까지나 바라보고 있었다. 바로 우물가 가락나무밑에서 다시오마고 기약하든 그밤이 영정스러워, 돌한덩이 풀한포기 나무한구루 아물래 소녀로해서 정이가는듯 이날이때것 그것들에게서 느껴보지못하든 애끊는 추억의 거리가 되든게였다.\n숙명이는 활을 동댕이친채 서분녀가 몇 번이고 돌아보며 넘든 잿등을 눈어림해가며 소녀를 찾아떠났든것이나, 십리를가도 이십리를 거듭 재우처보기로 첩첩이쌓인 산악과산학(山壑)뿐 낯익은 가막까지도 얼씬없었다. 그만 기가질려 쭉지를느리고 돌아서고보니 발도부르터 토독만얻은셈이였다.\n봄빛이 좀더 짙어올때 숙명이는 문득여승을 기다리는 마음이 불연듯 새로웠다. 옳다, 파일이면 숭이 오려니, 숭이오면 저를 어엽비역여 소원도 일러주고, 어쩌면 서분녀곁으로 그를 인도할지 모르리라고 외진생각만에도 마음은 한결 가벼웠고 가슴도 후련해서 앞날이 급작이 청청해지는듯, 오랜만에 산보람을 느낀듯이 마음싸게 살림도 거드렀다.\n허나 파일은 척 오지않았다. 산중무력일(山中無曆日)이란 괸한소리지, 손곱아 마날다헤아리기로 해동하는바람이 언제까지나 시뻤고, 개푸전 버들가지에 버들개지가 눈을뜨고, 시내를 따라 메로 스치드는꽃샘하는바람이 진달래 개나리가 피어도 을스냥스럽기＜193＞만했다.\n이러구러하는사이에 산은 제대로 푸르러저 벅꾹이가 아침저녁으로 우물가엣 가락나무에와선 꼬리로 키질을해가며 울었다.\n사월파일이 내추모레라는때 숙명이는 산장 구메논밭도 얼추갈았고, 행여 숭이쉬여가나해서 집오래도 정갈히 소쇄를했다. 뜰을쓸고 길을닦고 황토를 깔았다. 산나물에도 진풍으로 더덕,ㆍ고사리ㆍ두릅따위를 구해다 무치기로 준비도했다. 조밥일망정 끼니를때일 거리도 있으니 그만이였다. 그렇게 여승을 맞아 음식을 대접하리라는 궁리였다.\n하로 이틀 그런날이 지내가는동안 진짬 그날이 돼서 숙명이는 밤을 드새인 뻑뻑한눈을 슴먹이며 일지감치 산길 몇십리를 장다름에 뛰여넘었고, 해여 여숭의 모습이 안개속에 우렷이 나타날듯만싶어, 바위너덜경에 뻗치고선채 눈길이 모질게 작년이날에 그를 만나든 무덤이있든 골짜구니를 직히는게였다.\n\n짐작대로 한낮이 겨운때 숭운 무덤을 찾아왔었다. 가상히 역입은 도로혀 여숭편이여서 반색을하며 소년을 맞는게였다. 두메에 기뜨는몸이니 오작 고달프며 개화(開化)된 대읍처가 그립긴들 여북하랴, 허지만 어대가도 드리없이 고생만이 무진한게 세상사니, 아야 내생의 극낙을 바랄게니라고, 오분조분 이야기가 얼러젔다. 숙명이는 애수속에 눈물조차 먹음어가며 제몸이 의지할곳이 없음과, 소녀로해서 마음에 받는고초가 너무도 크노라고 저윽히 비창한낯이되며 이실고지를했고, 제한몸을 얼마구 앞으게하거나 고달프게하는한이 있드라도 소녀만을 찾아내럄이 소원이라했다.\n그렇게 덧대놓고 자기를 거두어달라했고, 아마적엔 소녀를 찾지않고는 못백이겠노라고 아뢰였드니 숭도 그까스라진 거조가 앙징스럽긴했으나 솔곳이 들고있을을뿐 한참이나 하욤없드니,\n「그까짓 윈갓 번뇌를 버리오, 인생이란 따지고보면 그저 무상(無常)한것……낳며죽으며하는게 워낙 허무스런겐즉 부러괴롬을 살건 무어요. 더구나 계집으로해서 몸을망치고 평생을 그릇치는사람이 그얼마일고. 젊음이 죄되여 한번 파게를하는날 육신의대가픔으로 영혼이받는책벌은 영원한 것이오, 청춘이 야숙키로 괴롬도 한때일것을……지레 슬픔을 살건 무어있오, 내 옛이야기를 하나하랴……」＜194＞하더니, 숭운 초연히 김숨을 지으며 다음과같은 이야기를 하는게였다.\n\n역시 깊은 산골이였다. 긴세월을 두고 주봉 바로 그밑으로 흐르는 시내는 산학을 침식하며 맑은 물소리 너덜겅과절벽밑으로 흘러나리고, 시나브로 웅퉁바위를 핥으며 기여가는 안개는 개를 따라 골짜기로 번져 흘터젔다.\n그렇게 산학은 시내를 품었고 산은 안개에 싸여 움즉였다. 그리고 이움죽이는 시내며 산기슭을 따라 군데로 백성이기뜰어 극히 원시적인 생활을 배반차리고했으니 역시 그러한백성속에 한 형제가 끼아처사되 남다른 동기애에 산보람있이 형은 동생을 끔즉히 아끼었고 아우는 형을 거드러가면 살아왔다.\n그러하든 차비에 애욕의 갈등으로 동생을 죽이고나든 순간, 형의 이지(理知)는 급기야 강진만난 건물처럼 근저로 와락문허지고 말았다.\n무엇이 대껴서 마득해 동생을 해치라고, 정녕코 미친사람의 행동으로 의장(擬裝)한대도, 무서운 패륜의 죄명을 씻슬구실은 못된다 손치고라도, 웅천인 그에게 얄구진 양심의가책만 없단들 형은 한 개의동물처럼 살아갈른지 몰랐다.\n허나 더럭 탐이 난다고 수단을 가리지않고 그치뜬 보짱머리대로 일을 저질르고보니, 짜장 양심이란게 매를들고 나섰다. 역시 인간인 때문에 이렇게 약했었든지 모르지만-\n이래저래 형은동생을 죽였다. 한 개의 계집으로연한 치정 때문에. 그것도 범연할수법이아니오 스름이끼치는 작살(斫殺)이였다. 선들선들하게스리 날이선낫으로 동생의 허구리를 단매에 나리찍어 거꾸러트렸다. 신신찮은일 때문에 너무나 큰비극이 버러지고 말았던것이다.\n심산속에 바람결같이 태여난 형이며동생……자연속에 낳서 그것에다 생을 의탁한 그들의살림은 조촐할망정 오붓했다. 소박한마을을 진니는아우는 날마다 형을따라 먼산에 그들의 오직 단골솜씨인 나무를하라 떠나고했으니, 그날도 도라지로 죽을 끓여먹고 떠난참이지만, 늦어가는 가을풍경이 한것 아름다워, 만자천홍으로 메와들은 단풍에 물들어 동생의가슴속은 그저 현란했으니, 그것은 간밤에도 그의가슴에다 머리를 묻고 달에두고 뱅세하든 소저의언약이 눈에 선하든까닭이다. 천누만추 길이살아 아들딸 낳아가며 부귀공명 누려보자든 소저의 귀＜195＞인성스런 모습이 그냥떠올랐다.\n산천이며 초목이 저네를 위해 생겨난듯, 어느것이라고 연연한 사랑의 상징(象徵)이아님이없어, 빛나는 그의앞엔 행복만이 기다릴듯.\n「가을이 다 가기전에 보금자리를 꿈이자, 붙이라군 저하나여니 형이 설마 훼살이야 놓으랴, 설혹 그러하기로 메시랴, 억센 팔다리가 있겠다, 소저는 벼를 좀질짜나. 자리를 뜨면 그만인걸.」\n그런생각에 고부라진동생은 섶포기를 후려갈기는솜씨조차 걸쌌다.\n날은맑고 그냥 드높다. 그렇게 따스로운 하늘밑에서도 형은 올가망스런채 명문이 터질틋, 서도앉아도 눈이뒤집혀 악만 부등부등 치밀었다. 일을테면 소저는 재차지가 분명한게니, 동생은 물라말이지 사리대로 따질말룬 소저에겐 진작부터 사랑의 고백을 했고, 다짐은 못두었을망정 제품으로 돌아올것임에도 소저는 노상 길삼질에만 정성인듯, 시집올 엄두도 아니내는꼴이, 모르면몰라도 형의소시에는 동생과눈이맞아가지고 저는 닭쫓든개로 따돌리는셈이라고, 그만 애정의관측을 그릇한형은 전율할 고비핀에까지 유혹이되가지고,\n「동생만 처치해 버려라, 다음에 소저야잡아논 토기가아니냐」\n그런 엉뚱한 악마의 귓속임에 가슴은 제대로 두방맹이질을 했으나, 전후를 뇌까릴새도없이 동생을 처치해버리게 형의머리는 단순했고 그수단은 잔인했었다.\n뻐드러진 동생을 붓안고 영원이 도리킬수없는 인생의실책에 자지러지게 놀라 의식이 전도됨을 느끼였다. 비록 처참한광경은 순간이였으나 지우지못할 죄악을 오래두고 말하랴는듯 붉은피는 무주공산의 검은흙속으로 번저들어, 가뜩이나 피를 토하듯이 붉은단풍마저 놀(夕照)에 비끼어 만학천봉은 만판 피로 물들어 냥자하기 그시없었다.\n피에 엉겨 빼드러진 동생을 그러안고 한나절을 바위처럼 굳어진 표정으로 하늘을 노려보든형은, 흥분이 우선해지고 제저지른행동이 죄의 의식으로 변해갈 때 그죄엔 벌이있을듯, 인륜의 계률을 무언중에 느끼든 그는 저윽히 회심의 낯빛이되였다. 회의도 투기도 희망도 사라진허탈된 가슴속에 몰아엉키는 순정은 동기애(同氣愛) 그것뿐이였다. 사랑의극치, 정대애, 그건 죽음이였다. 지극한사랑과지극한 죽음, 그것은 모든죄를 속상하고 남음이있으리라.＜196＞\n죽엄은 모든정리를 가저오너니라고, 형은 피묻은 낫을 들어 제배를 갈으고 동생을 앞세우고 뒤를 따라가리든 뜻이였다.\n허나 형은 끝까지 속알머리 드틴 뇟보였다. 종당에는 배엣 상창(傷創)을 붓안은채 단방약인 약초를 뜯어다 붙이고 무덤을 파는게였다. 산영장을지낼셈이였다. 제웅을 자신의송장처럼 꾸미어 제손으로 장사지냈다.\n두둑한 무덤이 이루어젔을때 동생의 주검은 바로 산소앞에 그린듯이 안치했었다.\n형의 무덤과 동생의 주검을 찾아낸 마을사람들은 사리에 미루어 거룩한 동기애라고 일컬어 따지기를「-형이 섶밭속에서 나무를하고 있었다, 그곳으로 달려오든동생은 얼결에 칙넌줄속에서 무엇이 들먹거리는 기수를 채자, 노루같은 짐승으로 그릇알고 낫으로 찔러놓고보니 형이라, 동생은 그만 면목없음과 동기를 잃은 슬픔에서 형을 고이 묻고, 그무덤앞에 죽음으로 그죄를 대가픔함이라」고, 여기 형제무덤이 생기고, 그들을 위해 이골짜기를 형제무덤골이라고 일커러준다.\n헌데 운명의작희(作戱)는 어대까지나 짖구저서 궐후 잇해가 되든해봄에 형은 표현히 소저의앞에 나타났다. 그때 이미동생의자식을 분만한소저는 실로돌에도 나무에도 댈데없는 허잘것없는 신세가될밖에 없는것이 주위에서완전히 버림을 받았든것이고, 가뜩한데 형이나타나가지고 동생의자식을 뺏는대로 그것마저 덧얹어주고, 실멋이 출가(出家)를하고말았다. 그벌로 형도자식도 이벌이됐고, 얼마후에 소저는 남편의뼈를 버들상자에 담아이고 어느절로 가는길채에다 옮겨 면레를 식혀주었다.\n그리고는 파일이 몰아오는날이면 그무덤에 빠짐이없이 찾아오는 한 숭이있어 무덤에 보로를하고 꽃을뿌리고 남편의 명복을 비는데, 그는 철없는 제한몸으로연해 저질러진 이형제무덤의 슬픈전설을소상히 지숙하는 오직한사람뿐인 소저로서, 속절없이 지내든그는 한많은세상의 속죄를하랴 입산수도의길을 떠난갓이였다.\n숭은 이같은 이야기를 느려놓고나서는\n「애정이란게 야숙한것인줄도 모르고서리 한몸으로 형과동생새의 두틈을 뻐개고대서지못한채 애매스레 지냈던 철없는소저의 순정이 죄이였죠. 자칫한 잘못으루 평생을 그릇치기 첩경쉬우니, 부디 이녁두 계집을 삼가시오, 나무아미타불……」\n말을맺는숭은 긴 한숨조차 지었다.＜197＞\n숭의 이야기를 듣고난 숙명이는 슬픈형제의전설보다 형제무덤골이라는 그골짜기가 혹시나 소녀가 일러주든 그고장이아닐가싶어 가슴이 대구 설레였다.\n「숭님, 형제무덤골이란 어데쯤이오니까?」\n하고 캐여묻는 숙명의얼굴은 몹시 긴장했다.\n「그건 캐여 무엇하오」\n숭도 적지아니 당혹해하며 진작부터 무엇을 경계하는 눈치였다.\n「아니올시다, 자나깨나 보고지든 그고장이 올시다 정이 야숙한줄 모름이 아니와 서분녀가 지낸다든 그고장일가 싶기에……」\n「서분녀?」\n「서분녀! 오마고 다짐을 두고간 바루 그 계집애올시다」\n「……정이 그렇다문.에서 칠십리나 나리가면 월출골(月出谷)이구, 게서 서쪽으루 칠십리길에 형제무덤골이 있을법하오」\n하는 숭의눈은 민망스런듯 빛났다. 서분녀란 계집이 무엇이관대 미망이저서 저렇듯 고련해하는 소년의마음을 헤아림에 이만저만한 정분이 아닐가보아 종작없이 그를 탄할수는 없었고, 불연듯 상막한 기억속에 생게망게한 생각때문엔지,\n「젊은이 나이가 멫니지?」\n숭이 입을 열었다.\n「열아홉!」\n「열아홉?」\n손년의 대꾸를 되받는 숭은 그만 목소리가 비비꼬임을 느끼였다.\n「아버진? 어머닌?」\n부러 허공에 눈을주어 건성으로 묻는듯싶으면서도 숭의눈은 변나게 불안에젖었었다.\n「숭님두, 아버지만이라구 몇 번이나 알려드렸다구」\n「그래그래, 참 늙으문 잔망궂어저서 아버질모시구 어대서 지낸닸지?」\n「예서두 삼십리 떨어진 신선골에서 산다군 몇 번채 뇌인소린데-비록 누춘할망정 숭닉을 모시랴구 두루 정성것마련두 해밨는걸요, 하루밤 쉬어 갑시사구……」\n허나 말하는소년의 모습을 다시한번 뚤어지게 팔피든 숭은, 자칫하면 그 자리에 쓸어질듯 무서운추억 때문에 기력이 부치는지 겨우 떨고일어서며 얼마동안을 무춤거리였다. 마을을 꺽지게 먹고 무엇을 강깅히 익히고 넘으랴는 모지름이 넉넉하였다.＜198＞\n숭은 글렇게 만류하는 숙명의청을 뿌리치고 물미가 급한 비탈길을 나리드디며 짓굿진 숙명(宿命)에 몸서리가쳤다.\n「행인더러 소맷부리가 스처저두 이승의 이연이랐으니……명춘 파일에 부디 다시 오우」\n숭은 후둘후둘 떨리는소리로 주어리고 다시금 돌아서서 석장을 들어흔들었다.\n「숭닙! 꼭, 꼭 여기서……」\n숙명이는 우선 숭의말이 고마워 벌씬 웃고나니덧따라 코허리가 시큰해젔다.\n한참을 앉았다가 그만 자리를 떴다. 그까짓 숭따위 다시보건말건 무어 그리대견스러우랴 형제무덤골로 어서가리라는 그생각빼고는 없었다.\n월출골서 칠십리라면 그맛 멫길 백사십리라건 사냥의 하로길이 아니냐? 숙명이는 호들감스럽게휘파람을 불며불며 신선골로 돌아왔다.\n\n뜬눈으로 밤을 드새인 숙명이는 한시가 시새워 아침드리 감발에 들메를하고 들레였다. 비록 헤실수라도 보고지는 형제무덤골이였다.\n아버지에겐 사냥을 간다고 어정쩡하게 한마디를 던지고 미심길로 활을들고 실멋이 집을 뒤에두었다\n배를타고 시네를건너 허방을 집으며 안개속에 아련하게 뵈는 월출골의 푸른산을 눈어방 천방지축달리였다. 후미진협곡을싸고 시내는 길이길이 흐르고, 시내를 가루건너 진펄이진 오리나무밭을 꿰질르고나가노라면 다시 빈밋한 구릉이고, 그건다시 황소 등어리처럼 뻗어가지고는 천야만야 높은주봉에 이따라 그런산과영이 첩첩이 쌓인 그밖의 월출골이있었다.\n처음이 어리삥삥했지 정작 와서보니 언제인가 사냥길에 산매(山魅)에 흘린듯헤매다가 이고장의 어떤 인가에 구원이된 기억이 새로워 반가웠다.\n면목이있든 그산막에서 먹든 대궁으로허기진 배를 불리고, 다시 서녁하늘가에 기우러지라는 해와대서 부르트는 신발도생각할새없이 언제까지 한 대중인 우툴두툴한 산길을 채치었다. 허기가지면 지천으로있는 산나물을 뜩어씹으면 그만이었고, 꼴꼴거리고 흐르는 석간수는 달고도시언스러웠다.\n어레짐작대로 허방지방 서두른길이 그래도 형제무덤골엔 해와맞우 대였다. 그래도 처음요량보다는 헝그러웠다. 누엿누엿 서산에 기우러지는 햇발은 붉은놀이되여 메와골짜기에 포근히 물들어 윈누리가 끄슬릴듯 붉은데, 마을을 꼭 정막에 잠겼었다.＜199＞\n역시 부대기가 단골솜씨인가보아 푸른산속에 군데로 부대기판이 끼어 끄솔린멫발이 숭업다. 가탈진 산장을 끼고 게딱지같은 오막살이가 이멫발에 한 채, 마즌편에 한 채, 잿둥넘어로 외진곳에 한집, 부대기를 따라 이동하는 뜨내기들이라 처지대로 주접하는 살림살이터임에도 숙명이에겐 적지않은 번영(繁榮)으로 보였다.\n마음만 앞섰지 정작 서분녀를 어쩌자는 묘리는 없었다. 어느것이 서분녀네집인지 개미새끼한마리 삐끗없는터에 뉘다려 그런잔정을 캐여볼수도 없었고 그렇다고 어리둥절한채 섰자니 가슴만 두방맹이질을했다.\n어차피 서분녀를 맞나지못하는날엔 죽기로서 신선골에는 아니돌아가기로 마음먹었음에 무엇을 바재워랴 하고보니 없는 용기가 솟는듯, 이미 황혼이 짙어 떵검의진후이라, 그리 서둘을것없이 넌지시 산기슭에 자리를 잡고 밤들기를 기다려 마을의동정을 엿보기로 하였다.\n초아흐래달이 제법 으스레하니 푸른 그림자를 던지는데, 드끄러운 개고리 우름소래속에 동안이뜨게개가 꽁꽁짖고, 귀에익은, 접동새 우름이 유달리 정다웠다.\n근덕근덕 조다가 제곁에놀라 깨고보면 하늘엔

It announces a new academic lecture series featuring prominent colonial-era colleges and the serialization of the screenplay for a Japanese military propaganda film, \"You and I,\" promoting the volunteer soldier system. The literary section features Korean ballads and new fiction. The postscript also includes calls for branch managers and encourages readers to subscribe annually due to wartime paper shortages. From a historical perspective, the postscript vividly illustrates the magazine operating under late colonial, wartime conditions. It showcases the promotion of state-sponsored concepts like \"Naesŏn\" (Japan-Korea unity) and the volunteer soldier system, alongside cultural content, reflecting the complex reality of cultural production under Japanese rule and mobilization efforts.

Since the movie currently in production, \"You and I\" (그대와 나), is a production of the Army in Korea (朝鮮軍), I would appreciate it if Mr. Takai (高井), as the supervising director, could first speak about the production's intent.\n\n**The Production Intent of \"You and I\"**\n\nTakai: Actually, since Mr. Hina (日夏) was in charge of planning, I think it would be better for him to speak, but our Army's intention, since the Incident [referring to the Second Sino-Japanese War], is that the Peninsula populace on the home front (銃後半島民衆) has demonstrated loyalty and patriotism (盡忠報國) in various ways, no less than people in the Mainland (內地人). We wanted to show even one aspect of this surprising devotion (赤誠) to the Mainland people, so that the people of both the Mainland and the Peninsula (內鮮 兩民衆) can join hands and march forward together even more, thereby achieving unity in name and reality (名實共히 一體). To begin with, we intended to film scenes depicting aptitude as volunteer soldiers.\n\nHina: As Mr. Takai mentioned, the aim is to show our Mainland compatriots (內地同胞), who are not yet familiar with Korea (朝鮮), the aspects where the Peninsula populace demonstrates through their lives that they are also splendid Japanese people. At this time when the nation faces an unprecedented crisis and demands the exertion of the people's total strength for the construction of an advanced national defense state, we aim to inform the general public in the Mainland about the actual situation in Korea, such as the patriotic fervor (愛國熱) of the Peninsula people and the Imperialization movement (皇民化運動). By doing so, we seek to correct and improve (市政向上 시키고) the Mainland public's perception of Korea and, consequently, further enhance the military spirit (軍人精神) among the youth of the Peninsula, thereby striving to expand the nation's driving force. We thought the shortcut (捷徑) to achieving this was to suggest (示唆) it through the art of film, which has the most contact with the people and can be digested through bright entertainment value. <112>\n\nKim: By the way, what initially motivated the planning of this film?\n\nHina: I finished middle school in Korea (朝鮮) and then went straight to Tōkyō, where I attended school for two years. It's been 16 years since I entered the film industry, and this February was the first time I came back to Korea. Having been away from Korea for so long, my knowledge of Korea was like a blank slate. Out of a desire to know Korea, I visited President Shōda (條田) of Keijō Imperial University (城大總長) on Kigensetsu [National Foundation Day] last February. He told me, \"If you want to know Korea, go see the volunteer soldier training center.\" Through the arrangement (幹旋) of Mr. Shiobara (塩原), the Director of Academic Affairs (學務局長) at the time, and the courtesy of the Army in Korea, I went to the training center and lived and ate together with the volunteer soldiers for 10 days. During that time, I was deeply moved and enlightened, which led me to plan to make this into a film. Together with Mr. Iijima Tadashi (飯島正), I completed the scenario titled \"Kimi to Boku\" (君と僕), published it in the magazine \"Eiga Hyōron\" (映畵評論), and immediately began production.\n\nPak: From what date did filming commence?\n\nInoue: We started on July 10th.\n\nKim: How much longer will it take to complete?\n\nInoue: It will likely take until mid-September. We plan to release it (封切) in October.\n\nPak: What is the meaning behind the film title \"Kimi to Boku\"?\n\nHina: \"Kimi\" (きみ), meaning \"you,\" is a general term (總稱) for the people of the Mainland (內地人). \"Boku\" (ぼく), meaning \"I,\" is a general term for the people of Korea (朝鮮人). It signifies that you and I should firmly join hands and become the cornerstone (礎石) of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere (大東亞共榮圈).\n\n**Differences in Acting between Mainland and Korean Actors**\n\nPak: Korean actors and actresses also appear in this film, \"You and I.\" Are there differences in acting compared to Mainland actors?\n\nHina: Well now. If I say there's a difference, they might get upset during filming, which would be trouble, wouldn't it? (Laughter from all) Of course, it depends on the actor, but with famous actors (名優) like Kosugi Isamu (小杉勇) from Nikkatsu (日活) and Obinata Den (大日方傳) from Tōhō (東寶) appearing, I can't say the acting level is exactly the same. However, the acting of the Korean actors is also surprising, and there were points where I marveled that they were not inferior to the Mainland actors.\n\nTakai: The acting may be so, but I hear there's quite a difference in Japanese pronunciation (國語發音), causing a major blow to the sound recording. <113>\n\nHina: Yes, we face considerable difficulty with the lines (セリフ - serifu). That's why we're busy drilling them on their lines every night.\n\nKim: Still, our Koryŏ Film Company's (高麗映畵社) exclusive actress Kim Sin-jae (金信哉) is alright in terms of both acting and lines, isn't she?\n\nHina: Yes, Kim Sin-jae does well.\n\nKim: Hey, Mr. Pak. Make sure you don't forget Mr. Hina's answer and include it in the article.\n\nPak: Are you trying to promote your own company even while attending someone else's roundtable? (Laughter from all)\n\nTakai: It seems he's trying to fulfill his duties as the head of publicity. (More laughter from all)\n\n**Hardships During Production**\n\nPak: Since actors from both the Mainland and Korea are participating, and given the location shooting (ロケ - roke) in Korea, are there many difficulties?\n\nHina: Regarding the Korean actors, the lines (セリフ) mentioned earlier are the biggest difficulty. Other than that, for location shooting, we've received unexpected assistance from various quarters, so progress is very smooth, sometimes even faster than anticipated. The number of personnel mobilized for this production, including actors, exceeds one thousand people daily. Since all the actors are lodging together at the volunteer soldier training center in Yangju-gun (楊洲郡) outside the city, for location shoots in the city, the Kyŏngch'un Railway (京春鐵道) provides conveniences such as adding temporary extra trains or increasing the frequency of departures—truly considerable accommodation. Having trains temporarily added for film production is unprecedented even in the Mainland. Furthermore, the Keiden Company [Kyŏngsŏng Electric Company] (京電會社) installs extra lighting for outdoor location shoots. And regarding costumes, the excessive support (後援) from both Hwashin (和信) and Mitsukoshi (三越) department stores leaves us deeply moved. What I've mentioned so far is support from private organizations, but the Army (軍) also provides unprecedented assistance, <114> truly bringing tears to our eyes (感泣を不禁). Particularly, when we needed soldiers for a scene and went to the Army Headquarters (軍司令部) to negotiate, Lieutenant Yasui (安井中尉) said, \"Why are you making such a fuss? If you need more than 60, we'll send even more.\" Also, for the upcoming filming of battlefield scenes, they said they would lend us tanks, machine guns, and other weapons. The convenience provided is beyond words. That's not to say there are no difficulties at all, but with the encouragement and support from the military, government, and private sector, we experience even hardship as pleasure.\n\n**General Itagaki Also Appears in \"You and I\"**\n\nHina: Today, coincidentally, the first graduation ceremony (修了式) for this year's Army special volunteer soldier trainees was held grandly at the volunteer soldier training center starting at 10 AM. Governor-General Minami (南總督), Army Commander Itagaki (板垣軍司令官), Yi Han-gu (李恒九), Chief Secretary of the Office of the Yi Royal Household (李王職長官), Kawagishi (川岸), Secretary-General of the Chōsen Federation (朝鮮聯盟事務總長), Suzukawa (鈴川), Governor of Keiki Province (京畿道知事), and other dignitaries were in attendance. As the film \"You and I\" also required a scene of the volunteer soldiers' graduation ceremony, we were able to film it since the ceremony was taking place. Besides our own cameras and sound recorders, we also mobilized those from Koryŏ Film Company (高麗映畵社), using two sound recorders and four cameras—Mitchell, Parvo, Eyemo, Howell—to capture General Itagaki (板垣大將), Governor-General Minami, and others on film. This is truly a great harvest for us, and having the two generals appear in the movie \"You and I\" is the highest honor (至上의 光榮).\n\n**Actor Exchange Also Unprecedented in Film History**\n\nPak: It seems that actors from various Mainland film companies are appearing in the currently produced \"You and I\"?\n\nHina: Yes, Kosugi Isamu from Nikkatsu (日活), Obinata Den from Tōhō (東寶), Tsubouchi Yoshiko (坪内美子) and Miyake Kuniko (三宅邦子) from Ōfuna (大船), Ri Kōran (李香蘭) from Man'ei (滿映), and other actors and actresses from various film companies are appearing. Having actors from so many different film companies appear in a single film production is also a phenomenon that can be called a first in Mainland film history. <115> The joint appearance of Mainland and Korean actors can be seen as an achievement in the implementation of Japan-Korea unity (內鮮一體), but the exchange (交驩 - likely a typo for 交換, exchange) of Mainland actors is truly a phenomenon seen for the first time since the beginning of history, I think.\n\nKim: There was talk that Ch'oe Sŭng-hŭi (崔承喜) would also appear. When is she coming?\n\nTakai: It was decided that Ms. Ch'oe Sŭng-hŭi would also appear, but due to some circumstances, it was decided she would not participate.\n\n**Cast of \"You and I\"**\n\nKaneko Eisuke (金子英助) (25 yrs old) (Volunteer soldier, later Private Second Class) Nagata Genjirō (永田絃次郞)\nKinoshita Tarō (木下太郞) (25 yrs old) (Volunteer soldier, later Private Second Class) Sim Yŏng (沈影)\nAn Mok (安木) (Volunteer soldier, later Private Second Class) Ch'oe Un-bong (崔雲峰)\nShimizu (淸水) (Volunteer soldier, later Private Second Class) Kim Yŏng-du (金永斗)\nYamamoto (山本) (Volunteer soldier, later Private Second Class) Yi Kŭm-ryong (李錦龍)\nVolunteer Soldier A (Volunteer soldier, later Private Second Class) Takemoto Shū (武本秀)\nVolunteer Soldier B (Volunteer soldier, later Private Second Class) Yamamoto Masao (山本正雄)\nAsano Mitsue (淺野美津枝) (Student at Music & Gymnastics School) Kurashima Hanako (倉島華子)\nKubo Ryōhei (久保良平) (Director of Puyŏ Museum Branch) (Nikkatsu) Kosugi Isamu (小杉勇)\nKubo Fusako (久保房子) (Ryōhei's wife, Mitsue's older sister) (Ōfuna) Tsubouchi Yoshiko (坪內美子) (Typo?

You seem to have been active in the Mainland film industry for quite a long time. How many years have you worked in that field, and please tell us about your experiences from the motive that first led you into the film industry to the present day.\n\nHina: Well, there's not much of a story to tell. My hometown is Hamhŭng (咸興). As soon as I graduated from the commercial school in Hamhŭng as the second graduating class, I went straight to Tōkyō. <116> While attending university in Tōkyō, I enjoyed literature; you could say I was a literary youth (文學靑年). Then, without finishing university, I jumped into the film industry. So, my film life has spanned a long period of 14 years.\n\nKim: Excuse me, but how old are you this year?\n\nHina: Thirty-four. So, I guess I entered the film industry when I was 20?\n\nInoue: Yes, it must have been when you were 20.\n\nHina: The first film company I joined was Makino Production (マキノ푸로덕슌). I started with titles, then did developing, camera work, and even acting. Now I handle screenwriting and directing, so I've pretty much done everything related to film. When Makino Production dissolved, I followed Director Futagawa Buntarō (二川文太郞), who had been my senior since the Makino days, and moved to Shōchiku Film Company (松竹映畵社). Mr. Futagawa Buntarō was a famous director at that time.\n\nInoue: Yes. Although many people might not know the name Futagawa Buntarō now, back then he was highly renowned as a superb director, and many actors were nurtured under him.\n\n**Critique of Korean Cinema**\n\nPak: Please tell us your impressions after watching Korean films. A film critique, that is.\n\nHina: The Korean films I've seen recently were quite excellent. Particularly, \"Tuition\" (授業料) and \"Homeless Angel\" (집없는 天使) were very outstanding works, unseen before in Korean cinema, and I viewed their scenario structures as not having lost their place.\n\nPak: If you praise Koryŏ Film Company's works too much, Mr. Kim might boast, saying they're his company's.\n\nKim: Hey, you! (Laughter from all)\n\nHina: Anyway, in that respect, my expectations for future Korean cinema are even greater. And one cannot deny that Korean cinema is indeed showing rapid development (長足의 발전).\n\n**Development Potential of Korean Cinema**\n\nPak: I would like to hear your esteemed opinion regarding the future development strategy for Korean cinema.\n\nHina: Well now. You're bringing up a very difficult question. I understand the general sentiment is to produce Korean films for Koreans, but I think a key point in the development strategy for Korean cinema might be to plan films targeting not only Korea (朝鮮) but also the Mainland (內地). <117>\n\nInoue: Regarding that issue, I too feel strongly about the need for Korean cinema to continue. For enlightening the Korean people about the current situation (時局) and embodying the spirit of Japan-Korea unity (內鮮一體), it's crucial to introduce the actual situation of Korea to the general public within the Mainland, so that both sides can firmly grasp hands. While respecting Korean cinema's specificity (特殊性), as well as Korea's culture, customs, other sentiments (情趣), and local color (鄕土色), this must start from the goal of Japan-Korea unity. Therefore, I believe films should be produced targeting not only Korea but also the Mainland and the Continent (大陸). In other words, keep your feet in Korea, but extend your hands to the Mainland and the Continent.\n\nKim: On that point, our film company also intends to plan films based on national consciousness (國家意識), capturing various characteristics of Korea on film, but predicated on shaking hands (握手) with the Mainland and the Continent, and we are preparing for dynamic activities toward this end.\n\nPak: Thank you for sharing various insights for such a long time. We will now conclude this meeting. -End- <118>\n\n**Cultural Films Advance into China**\n\nCultural films targeting the Chinese populace: Previously, Japanese cultural films with Mandarin narration (華語 아나운스 版) were used as cultural films for the Chinese populace. However, as this was insufficient to perfectly achieve the objective, the Cabinet Information Bureau (內閣情報部) has embarked on the production of newly planned Mandarin-language cultural films aimed from the outset at the Chinese populace. They invited Mr. Huang Suichu (黃隨初), distribution section chief of Chūka Eiga (中華榮華 - likely Chūka Eiga Haikyū K.K. 中華電影配給株式會社), and under his supervision, commissioned the Dōmei Film Department (同盟映畵部) to produce five works: \"Japanese Industry\" (日本的 工業), \"Japanese Fishery\" (日本的 漁業), \"Japanese Medicine\" (日本的 醫學), \"Japanese Physical Education\" (日本的 體育), and \"Winged Japan\" (翼的日本). These will soon be distributed and screened throughout Central and South China (中南支 一帶). Before the public release, a preview screening (試寫會) was held at the Chūka Grand Theatre (中華大劇院) in Shanghai (上海), and mobile projection teams (巡廻映寫班) were dispatched to remote areas (僻地) to enlighten (啓發) the Chinese populace.\n\n**What is Film Personnel Registration?**\n\nFilm personnel registration requires individuals to attend a 5-day course at the Film Personnel Training Institute (映畵人講習會) and then pass an examination by the Film Personnel Association Skills Examiners (映畵人協會技能審査員). It is said that 113 film and theatre personnel are registered in Korea. The examination committee consists of the head of the Library Section (圖書課長) as chairman and 11 members: 2 officials related to film, 2 actors, 2 cinematographers, 3 individuals with academic knowledge and experience, and 3 managers (事幹).\n<112-118>\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis 1941 Samch'ŏlli article details a roundtable discussion about the propaganda film \"Kimi to Boku\" (\"You and I\"), produced by the Japanese Army in Korea. Director Hina Eitarō and Army representative Takai explain the film's purpose: to showcase Korean loyalty (especially volunteer soldiers) to the Japanese mainland audience, thereby strengthening Japan-Korea unity (*naisen ittai*) and promoting militarism during wartime. The discussion covers production challenges like language barriers with Korean actors, logistical support from the military and businesses, the unprecedented cooperation between major Japanese film studios, and the inclusion of high-ranking officials like General Itagaki and Governor-General Minami. Brief comments are made on the improving quality of Korean cinema, with suggestions that future films should target mainland Japanese and continental audiences. Two short appended notes discuss new Mandarin-language cultural films for China and the process for official film personnel registration in colonial Korea.\n\nFor historians, this article is highly revealing. It explicitly lays out the propagandistic intent behind state-sponsored cultural production, aiming to mobilize colonial subjects and manage perceptions both in Korea and Japan. The emphasis on *naisen ittai*, the showcasing of Korean volunteer soldiers, the involvement of the highest military and civilian authorities (Itagaki, Minami), and the discussion about extending Korean film's reach to the mainland highlight the mechanisms of ideological control and cultural assimilation during peak wartime mobilization. The logistical details, casting choices (including famous Japanese, Korean, and Manchurian stars like Ri Kōran), and the unprecedented cross-studio collaboration underscore the significant resources devoted to this propaganda effort.
