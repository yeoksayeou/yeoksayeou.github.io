Korea Diary, Korea in February

1. A Bundle of Incidents

Korea in February - The Kyŏngsŏng Electric municipalization (京城電氣府營) issue, which had been controversial since last year, seemed to reach a resolution in January, but by February, it became muddled. The Prefectural Governor unilaterally abandoned the municipalization plan, and the pro-municipalization faction, indignant, is reportedly studying countermeasures, but that's all there is to it.

Sanada Jinkichi (佐奈田甚吉), the mastermind of the 780,000 won incident that once decorated the dreams of penniless people, was sentenced to 8 years in prison. In a separate story, a policeman from Songjŏng-ri (松汀里), Chŏnnam (全南), who tortured a theft suspect to death, received a maximum sentence of 2 years in prison.

Starting in February, measles (紅疫) became even more rampant (猖獗), snatching away young lives. In Okch'ŏn (沃川), there were over 800 patients; in Iwŏn-myŏn (伊院面), the sound of weeping never ceased. In Hoeryŏng (會寧), Anju (安州), Unsan (雲山), Sin'gye (新溪), and even Yech'ŏn (醴泉) in Kyŏngbuk (慶北), patients numbered in the thousands, and deceased children in the hundreds. Ah, young spirits!

The issue of the agreed price for sardine oil (鰮油) in Hambuk (咸北) becomes increasingly problematic. Sardine oil manufacturers in Hambuk, joining forces with those in Hamnam (咸南) and Kangwŏn (江原) provinces, are aiming not to go below a minimum price of 2 won 50 chŏn per 10 kwan (貫). Let's wait and see who has more strength – them or the Mitsubishi Company (三菱會社) trying to buy at 2 won 30 chŏn.

The Japanese Consulate Police in Kando (間島) seem to be continuing aggressively vigorous activities, striving to eliminate the Communist Party and the Kookminboo (國民府 - National People's Government). Meanwhile, in Korea, there are plans to reduce the vast border security and greatly expand the thought police, assigning two additional thought police officers to each station. The times grow ever more complex and fraught with difficulties.

2. Hardship of Living

Why is the spring hardship (春窮) so severe! While it's utterly impossible for the hardships of January living to improve in February, our livelihoods only grow steadily worse! In 13 provinces, 14 prefectures, 2 islands, 218 counties, 2,464 townships – where is this not the case? Yet, Hamgyŏng (咸鏡) and Kangwŏn (江原) are suffering even more severely, their tragic state beyond description (不可形言). X came, and indeed, is the only thing to lose starvation?

In Hambuk (咸北), starving people number over 63,000. In Hamnam (咸南), in Kowŏn (高原) County's Santong-myŏn (山谷面) alone, displaced households number over 300, and households lacking food number 400. In Anbyŏn (安邊) County, over 10,000 people sustain their lives with roots and bark. In Sinhŭng (新興) County, over 20,000 people wander on the brink of starvation. As for Kangwŏn Province (江原道), displaced farming households number 3,300, and the poor in Injé (麟蹄) alone number over 20,000; these are people who cannot even eat porridge, their eyes sunken from hunger. Koksan (谷山), P'yŏnggang (平康), Yŏngil (迎日), Ch'aho (遮湖), Pukch'ŏng (北靑), Hoeryŏng (會寧), Chŏngp'yŏng (定平), Kosan (高山). Just counting those reported in February newspapers, their number is countless (不知其數). Only the demands of debt collectors are urgent, while the path to survival is distant. The relief funds from the Government-General are but a drop in the ocean (蒼海의 1束). Even so, in Puk-myŏn (北面), Injé (麟蹄) County, they reportedly deducted public charges from the relief measures for the poor – what kind of relief this is, one cannot know. In Koch'ang (高敞) Nodong-ri (蘆洞里), a husband who had starved for three days, while offering a bowl of porridge back and forth with his wife, had it devoured in an instant by their child, who had also starved for many days. Pained to the extreme by this miserable life, the husband drank lye ("양잿물") and committed suicide – Close your eyes, let's picture the well-fed and the starving across the 3,000-ri landscape.

3. Labor Movement

The wave of arrests sweeping across all of Korea (全鮮) shows no sign of stopping, and it's impossible to enumerate them all. Among them, the RS-related incident might be called the largest. The Sŏn'gwang Printing strike (鮮光印刷工盟罷) ended in failure, and the outcome of the Ch'ŏngjin (淸津) dock dispute is drawing attention.

28th: Cooperative Union (協同組) and Transport Union (運輸組) join the Ch'ŏngjin strike.
The Ch'ŏngjin dock strike group attacks non-union workers who are working; arrests continue.
29th: Sangsin Union (相信組) and Maru 2 Union (丸2組) waver in the Ch'ŏngjin strike.

4. Farmer Movement

The Pakkan Farm (迫間農場) and Tamok (多木) dispute issues, which began in January, continue to expand unabated, despite unfavorable interference by the police against the tenant farmers (小作人).

O Kyŏngnam (慶南) Pakkan Farm (迫間農場)
12th: Around 20 plainclothes policemen from Kimhae (金海), Masan (馬山), Munsan (文山), and Chin'yŏng (進永) are reportedly on high alert, tailing every tenant farmer. The farm side continues to focus solely on appeasing the tenant farmers (小作人 懷柔).
15th: Kimhae and Masan police stations arrest 13 cadres. The reason is reportedly unknown.
20th: At 10 AM, about 80 women, families of the arrested cadres and the dispute group, rushed to the farm, weeping and shouting for their release.

4th: Those benefiting from the establishment of the Uroche (牛老堤) Water Association oppose it.

8th: Corruption was exposed in the P'yŏngan Water Association (平安水利組合), where personal greed was satisfied; landowners filed lawsuits against the cadres.
9th: In the Chungnam Water Association (中南水利組合) of Ulsan (蔚山) County, land with unpaid water taxes was put up for auction, but there were no buyers even at 8 chŏn per p'yŏng.
10th: Sŏsŏng Water Association (西城水組) in T'aech'ŏn (泰川) County approved. Benefiting area 195 chōbo (町步).

**Summary**

This article from April 1932 details events in Korea during the preceding February. It covers various topics: the unresolved Kyŏngsŏng Electric municipalization issue, notable criminal sentences, a severe measles outbreak, disputes over sardine oil prices involving Japanese companies, increased police suppression of communists and nationalists, particularly through the expansion of "thought police." It vividly portrays extreme poverty and starvation (Spring Hardship - 春窮) in several provinces, especially Hamgyŏng and Kangwŏn, citing specific numbers of starving or displaced people and a tragic suicide due to hunger. The report also lists numerous labor strikes (like the failed Sŏn'gwang Printing strike and the ongoing Ch'ŏngjin dock strike) and farmer disputes (notably the Pakkan and Tamok farm conflicts involving tenant farmers against landowners and police), alongside arrests of activists (including RS group members). Finally, it details issues surrounding Water Associations (水利組合), including opposition, corruption, tax delinquency, and forced auctions. The article highlights the widespread social unrest, economic hardship, and tightening state control under Japanese colonial rule. Historians might find the specific details on starvation levels, the types and locations of labor/farmer disputes, the documented expansion of the "thought police," and the struggles related to Water Associations particularly valuable for understanding the socio-economic conditions and resistance movements in 1930s colonial Korea.

기사제목	朝鮮日誌, 2월의 조선
기사형태	소식

朝鮮日誌, 2월의 조선
1. 事件 1束
2月의 朝鮮 - 작년부터 말성이 되어오든 京城電氣府營問題는 1月달에 한 맧 풀리더니 2月에 이르러 흐지브지. 府君은 獨斷으로 府營案 抛棄, 府營派는 憤慨 對策硏究 중이라고 그저 그 뿐.
한 때 돈없는 사람의 꿈을 장식하든 78만圓事件의 主犯 佐奈田甚吉은 懲役 8年의 言渡를 받고, 이것은 다른 이애기 절도 犯人을 拷問致死한 全南 松汀里 巡査는 最高가 懲役 2年의 判決.
2月이 되면서부터 紅疫이 더욱 猖獗하야 어린 생명을 빼앗앗다. 沃川에는 환자가 800여명, 伊院面에 哭聲이 不絶하고 會寧 安州, 雲山, 新溪, 慶北에는 醴泉까지 환자가 數千, 死兒가 數百. 아 어린 靈이어!
咸北 鰮油協定價額問題는 益益問題化. 咸北 鰮油製造業者는 咸南과 江原 兩道와 合流하야 10貫 最低價格을 2圓 50錢 이하로는 하지않기를 期하고 잇다. 2圓 30錢에 살려는 三菱會社와 누가 힘이 센가 두고보자.
間島 日本領事館 警察은 積極的으로 猛活動을 계속하야 共産黨과 國民府를 없이하기에 노력하는 모양. 그러고 朝鮮에서는 尨大한 國境警備를 縮小하고 思想警察을 大擴張, 각 署에 2명식 思想警察을 增員할 計書. 때는 더욱 複雜多端.

2. 生活苦
春窮이 왜 이리 심하고! 1月의 生活苦가 2月이라고 나질 理 萬無하지마는 차차 심하야만 가는 우리의 살림! 13道 14府 2道 218郡 2,464面 그 어느 곳이 안 그러랴만 咸鏡, 江原이 더욱 심하니 그 慘狀은 不可形言, X와서 진대야 잃을 것은 오직 飢餓 뿐인가.
咸北의 飢餓民이 63,000여명, 咸南은 高原 郡山谷面만 流離 戶數 300여에 食糧絶乏 400戶, 安邊郡에 草根木皮로 命을 잇는 사람이 10,000여명, 新興郡에는 20,000여명이 飢餓線上에 헤매이고 江原道로 말할 것 같으면 流離農家 3,300戶 麟蹄의 窮民만이 20,000여라니 이들은 죽도 못먹고 배가 고파서 눈이 움푹들어간 사람들이다. 谷山, 平康, 迎日, 遮湖, 北靑, 會寧, 定平, 高山. 2月 新聞紙上에 나타난 것만 하야도 不知其數, 債鬼의 再促만 火急하고 사라나갈 方途는 아득하다. 總督府의 救濟費는 蒼海의 1束, 그것이나마 麟蹄郡 北面에서는 窮民救濟策에서 公課金을 控除하얏다 하니 무슨 救濟인지 아지 못할 일. 高敞 蘆洞里에서는 3日 동안 굶든 남편이 죽 한 그릇을 놓고 內外가 勸하는 동안에 여러 날 굶은 어린애가 이것을 어느 새 먹어 버리고 이 慘澹한 생활에 悲痛 그 極에 달한 남편은 「양잿물」을 먹고 自殺햇다고-눈을 감아라, 三千里 江上에 먹고 배부른 사람과 못먹고 굼주린 사람을 그려보자.

全鮮에 일어나는 檢擧風은 멎을 줄을 모르고 이것을 다 枚擧할 손맧이 없다. 그 중에 RS關係事件이 제일 크다할까. 鮮光印刷工盟罷는 실패에 돌아가고 淸津埠頭爭議의 歸決이 注目處다.
