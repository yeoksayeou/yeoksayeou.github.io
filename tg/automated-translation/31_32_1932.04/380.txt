My Personality as I See It

When Angry    Posŏng Chŏnmun Kim Hyŏn-jun

My great flaw is that when I am angry, in an emergency, or planning something, I cannot endure and I act or begin without sufficient and meticulous consideration.

Calmness and Train Times    Posŏng Chŏnmun Ok Sŏn-jin

A hasty personality and carelessness are my major flaws. I envy the calm attitude of cautious and serious people. To fix this, I try to emulate the greatness of Mount T'ai and the vast ocean, and I make these efforts:
1.  I deliberately speak slowly and drawl.
2.  I walk as slowly as possible.
3.  The more I think something is urgent, the more I deliberately slow down.
4.  Before sleeping, I reflect on the day's carelessness and composure.
5.  When I feel the sense of satisfaction gained after being calm, I become convinced that composure is an important virtue and principle of universal fulfillment, and I strive for it.
Amidst these efforts, there are also laughable failures like these:
When going on a trip with friends, the train time was imminent, but I walked slowly and missed the train; when eating together with several people, because I eat slowly, all the good side dishes are taken away; on a summer day, when a sudden heavy rain falls like a thunderbolt from a clear sky, I don't walk quickly, get thoroughly soaked by the rain, catch a cold, and groan, etc. However, composure is a good virtue, so I do not regret it and strive even harder in that way.<132>

**Summary**

This article features two short personal reflections by students from Posung College (普成專門), Kim Hyŏn-jun and Ok Sŏn-jin, describing their character flaws. Kim Hyŏn-jun identifies his lack of patience and thorough consideration, especially when angry or rushed. Ok Sŏn-jin details his efforts to overcome his hasty and careless nature by consciously slowing down his speech and movements, reflecting daily, and emulating natural grandeur, despite humorous setbacks like missing trains or getting caught in the rain. For historians, the article offers a glimpse into the self-perception and aspirations for self-improvement (particularly emphasizing composure and deliberation) among educated Korean youth during the colonial period. The mention of Posung College places these personal reflections within the context of Korean higher education under Japanese rule.

내가 본 내 性格
忿할 때에    普成專門 金賢準

분할 때, 緊急할 때, 計劃할 때에 참지못하고 充分하고 緻密한 考慮가 없시 發動하거나 始作하는 것이 나의 大缺陷입니다.

沈着과 汽車時間    普成專門 玉璿珍

急한 性格과 輕率하다는 것이 나의 큰 缺点입니다. 愼重하고 黙重한 사람의 沈着한 態度를 부러워 합니다. 나는 이것을 고치기 위하야 泰山과 大洋의 偉大를 본받고 이러한 노력을 합니다.
1. 言語를 일부러 천천히 느러지게 하고,
2. 거름을 될 수 잇는 대로 緩緩히 하엿으며,
3. 急한 일이라고 생각할수록 일부러 느러지게 하고,
4. 就寢 前에 하루의 輕率과 沈重을 回想하고,
5. 沈着한 후에 얻은 滿足感을 느낄 때 沈重은 宇宙 充足原理의 一重要한 美德이며 原理임을 確信하며 노력중에 이러한 웃으운 失敗도 잇습니다.
親舊와 여행갈 때 汽車時間이 臨迫하엿는데 거름을 느리게 걸어 汽車를 노치고, 여러 사람과 飮食을 같이 할 때 천천히 먹는 고로 좋은 飯饌은 다 빼앗기고, 여름 날 靑天霹靂 沛然大雨할 때 거름 빨리 아니 걸어 비를 담숙 맞아 感氣걸려 呻吟하고, 등등 그러나 沈重은 좋은 德이라 後悔하지 않고 더욱 그러케 노력합니다.＜132＞
