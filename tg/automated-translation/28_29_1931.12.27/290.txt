Winter, To Yohan-gun
						An Sŏ

Raising its two arms, now only bones,
The tree trembles and weeps.
Its naked form (身勢) alone is pitiful,
And even the wind is so relentless.

Perhaps pitying the trembling tree's condition (情狀),
Laying down a fluffy white sheet,
Heaven coaxes it to sleep.
Snow comes, falls, piles up gently.

Covered in a blanket of snow, the tree sleeps.
Holding onto the new hope of Tomorrow (明日)
The harsh (酷毒) winter weeps in its heart.

The World (世上) is quiet, only the wind blows.
Do not say that Life (生命) dies at the whip's end.
When it's new spring, that Life (生命) will sprout again.<116>

**Summary**

This poem by An Sŏ uses the imagery of a bare, suffering tree in the harsh winter wind, which is eventually covered by comforting snow, allowing it to rest while holding onto hope for the future ("Tomorrow"). It concludes with a powerful assertion that life, though seemingly crushed ("at the whip's end"), will inevitably return with the spring. From the perspective of Korean colonial history, the poem resonates strongly with themes of endurance under oppression. The suffering tree could symbolize Korea under Japanese rule, the harsh winter and wind representing the colonial regime, while the eventual arrival of spring signifies the hope for liberation and national revival. Historians might find the poem's blend of natural imagery with subtle yet potent messages of resilience and future hope illustrative of Korean sentiment during this period.

겨울, 요한君에가Œ
						岸曙
뼈만 남은 두팔을 높이 내들고
나무는 부들부들 떨면서 우네.
헐벗은 身勢만도 어굴타는데
바람조차 이다지 악착하다고.

떠는 나무 情狀을 섫어함인지,
폭운폭운 흰자리 깔아놓으며,
하늘은 얼만지며 잠들라하네.
눈은 오네 내리네, 고이 싸이네.

눈니불에 덮여서 나무는 자네.
明日의 새른 희망 안은 그대로
酷毒스런 겨울은 맘으로 울고.

世上은 고요하고 바람만 부네.
채직끝에 生命이 죽는다 말게.
새봄일제 그 生命 돋아나느니.＜116＞
