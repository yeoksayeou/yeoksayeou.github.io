Chosŏn's 10 Great Athletes Popularity Poll

If you look at page 80 of this issue (本號), there is a list of Chosŏn's 10 Great Athletes as recommended by various experts (各 專門家 諸位). Now, our company (本社) seeks the fair votes of our general readers (一般讀者 諸氏) to make the final decision (最後의 斷案). Afterwards, we will introduce the figures and activities of the 10 great stars (明星) in the magazine, and also give prizes to those who voted (投票諸氏). The detailed voting rules are as follows (下記), so please read them carefully (熟讀) before voting. For the general vote, it is of course fine to vote for individuals not on this list if they possess the qualifications to be a star.

Voting Rules (投票規定)

1.  Write the names (氏名) of 10 people (men or women regardless - 男女莫論) whom you recognize as the most popular and outstanding among various athletes (各種 運動選手中) produced by Chosŏn on a postcard (葉書), listed consecutively (連書).
2.  Also, the voter must write their address and name on the back (裡面) and be sure to affix their seal (捺印) before sending (1 vote per person - 1人1票限).
3.  The top 10 finishers in order from the highest score (最高点) will be considered the winners (當選者), presented with commemorative gifts (紀念品), and introduced in the magazine (誌上).
4.  Furthermore, prizes will be given to those who correctly voted for the exact names of the 10 winners.
5.  The voting deadline (投票期限) is the end of February, and the announcement (發表) will be in the April issue of this magazine (本誌).

**Summary**

This article from the magazine *Tonggwang* announces a popularity poll for readers to vote for the "10 Great Athletes of Chosŏn." It explains the voting rules: readers should list 10 athletes on a postcard, include their own name/address/seal, and send it in by the end of February. The top 10 athletes will be announced in the April issue, featured in the magazine, and receive commemorative gifts. Voters who correctly guess the top 10 will also receive prizes. For historians, this article is interesting as it reflects the growing public interest in sports and potentially national figures within colonial Korea. The term "運動家" (undongga - athlete/activist) is ambiguous but clearly means athlete here. The poll itself, involving reader participation and celebrating Korean figures (even if apolitical athletes), signifies a form of public sphere activity and potentially subtle national consciousness during the Japanese colonial period.
