**Summary**

This piece from the December 1931 issue of *Tonggwang* magazine is a set of caricatures by Kim Yŏnghwan titled "Various Aspects of Musicians." It visually portrays prominent Korean musicians of the era: Hong Yŏnghu, An Kiyŏng, Ch'oe Hoyŏng, and Hyŏn Chemyŏng. The article highlights the presence of Western classical music and its practitioners in colonial Korea and the use of caricature as a form of cultural commentary in popular magazines. For historians, it identifies key figures in the Korean music scene of the early 1930s and demonstrates the role of publications like *Tonggwang* in reflecting and shaping cultural life during the Japanese colonial period. The format suggests these musicians had achieved a level of public recognition sufficient to be subjects of caricature.
