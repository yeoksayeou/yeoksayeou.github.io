November Prize Contest Answers Announcement (Continued)

Among the November prize contest topics (Tan'gun), the answers from ㄱ to ㅂ were already published in the January issue. However, due to space constraints, the answers to ㅅ, "How did you commemorate it?" could not be published together, so we are publishing them in this issue. As we cannot write down each of the numerous responses separately, we have extracted and categorized them below, which is quite interesting. We ask that those involved, and indeed anyone, please be sure to read this at least once.

**Summary**

This article from the February 1927 issue of "Tonggwang" magazine publishes categorized reader responses to a contest question about how they commemorated Tan'gun's birthday the previous November. The diverse list includes reading history or the magazine itself, personal reflection, prayer, specific actions like bowing towards T'aebaeksan, telling stories, holding ceremonies, expressing emotions ranging from joy to sorrow, and even admitting ignorance or inaction. It concludes by announcing upcoming scholarly articles on Tan'gun. From a historical perspective, the article is fascinating as it reveals the varied ways national consciousness and identity, centered around the foundational figure of Tan'gun, were being expressed and fostered among Koreans during the Japanese colonial period. The range of responses—from deeply personal and spiritual to overtly nationalistic or intellectual (reading works by Ch'oe Nam-sŏn and Yi Kwang-su), alongside admissions of ignorance—highlights the complex landscape of cultural identity and historical awareness under colonial rule, making it a valuable snapshot for historians studying nationalism and cultural movements of the era.
