Morning
						Kang Pyŏngju (姜炳周)

When the bright sunbeams welcoming the new day
Spread their wings over the eastern sky,
The morning mist that covered the distant mountain slopes
Silently hides away into the forest.

At this time, I alone
Come out to the fields
And towards the thicket gleaming, receiving the dew,
Walk like a dazed person.

From the village
The sound of dogs barking is often heard
And again, over there on the embankment (축동),
When one or two farmer-soldiers (農軍) appear—.＜54＞

**Summary**

This poem by Kang Pyŏngju describes the quiet transition from night to day in a rural setting. The speaker observes the dawn breaking, the mist receding, and then walks alone through dew-covered fields, feeling somewhat dazed. The scene concludes with the sounds of village life starting – dogs barking – and the sight of farmers heading out to work, referred to poetically or perhaps significantly as "farmer-soldiers" (農軍). For historians, the poem offers a glimpse into the atmosphere of the Korean countryside in the 1920s. The use of older Korean orthography (e.g., '한울', '숩', '업시') is typical of the period. The term '農軍' (Nonggun) is particularly noteworthy; while possibly just a poetic term for a group of farmers, its literal meaning ("farmer army") might hint at underlying social structures, peasant consciousness, or organized labor mobilization efforts during the colonial era, making it a point of interest for social historians.

아침
						姜炳周
새 날을 마지하는 밝은 햇발이
동녘의 한울 우에 나래를 펼 때,
먼산 기슭을 더펏던 아침 안개는
소리 업시 숩 속으로 숨어 버러라

이 때에, 나는 혼자
들에 나와서
이슬 마자 빗나는 수풀 밧으로
얼빠진 사람처럼 걸어 가노라.

마을에서는
개 짓는 소리가 자조 들리고
또 다시, 저 건너 축동 우에는
한 둘의 農軍이 나타날 적에-.＜54＞
