社告 (Company Announcement)

◆Unfortunately, the calendar supplement attached to the New Year issue was subjected to confiscation. We are endlessly sorry to our esteemed readers who were eagerly awaiting it.

◆The publication of Mr. Ch'oe Namsŏn's "Remains of Megalithic Culture in Korea (朝鮮에 在한 巨石文化의 遺蹟)," which was scheduled for this month's issue, has unavoidably been postponed until next month.

◆Ch'unwŏn's full-length serialized novel also could not be published again. The Editorial Department is making continuous efforts to ensure the manuscript is definitely published.

◆Preparations for the March issue are already complete. We know that all of you who faithfully read this magazine have absolute trust in its content, and furthermore, we promise not to fall short of your expectations. <70>

**Summary**

This announcement from the editors of *Tonggwang* magazine informs readers about several publication issues. They apologize for the confiscation of the New Year issue's calendar supplement by authorities. Additionally, they announce the unavoidable postponement of an article by Ch'oe Namsŏn on Korean megalithic sites and another installment of a serialized novel by Ch'unwŏn (Yi Kwangsu), assuring readers they are working hard to publish the latter. They conclude by stating the March issue is ready and expressing confidence in reader loyalty and their commitment to meeting expectations. From a historical perspective, the explicit mention of "confiscation" (押收) of the calendar highlights the reality of censorship under Japanese colonial rule. The repeated delays in publishing works by prominent nationalist intellectuals like Ch'oe Namsŏn and Yi Kwangsu (Ch'unwŏn) could suggest potential sensitivity of the content or difficulties navigating the colonial publishing environment, making this notice of interest to historians studying media control and cultural activities during that period.
