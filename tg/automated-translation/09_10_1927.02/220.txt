Kŏmdongi
						Yuk Minch'ŏl

Kŏmdongi happily
Runs towards me
On New Year’s morning
Wearing new clothes
After going to make
New Year’s bows
As I come back in
Kŏmdongi runs up
And jumps up at me
My muddy front hem
Mom sees it and
"Where did you fall down?"
She asks, but
Wagging its tail<64>
Looking up at me
Kŏmdongi’s appearance
Is pitiful, so
Silently gazing
I just stood there. (2, 18)<65>

**Summary**

This children's poem by Yuk Minch'ŏl depicts a simple, heartwarming scene on New Year's Day. A child, dressed in new clothes after performing traditional New Year's bows (sebae), returns home to be greeted enthusiastically by their dog, Kŏmdongi. The dog jumps up, muddying the child's clothes. When the mother asks where the child fell, the child remains silent, feeling pity for the innocent dog. From a historical perspective, the poem offers a glimpse into everyday life and children's sentiments during the colonial period. Its publication in *Tonggwang*, a significant literary magazine, highlights the continuation of cultural practices like Sŏllal (New Year's Day) and the expression of personal emotion, even under occupation. Historians might find interest in the portrayal of childhood innocence and the subtle emotional dynamics within a family setting during this era.

검동이
						陸敏哲
검동이 반겨서
달겨 옴니다
설날 아침에
새옷을 입고
세배를 갔다가
들어오니까
검동이 달려와서
뛰어 오름니다
흙묻은 앞자락
엄마 보시고
어대서 넘어졌냐
물으시지만
꼬리를 흔들며＜64＞
날 바라보는
검동이 그 모양
가련하여서
묵묵히 바라보고
섰었읍니다. (2, 18)＜65＞
＜64-65＞
