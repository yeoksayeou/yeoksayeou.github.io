**Body Text Translation**
Two Poems Written on an Autumn Day Ascending T'onggun Pavilion, Sent to an Old Friend
						By Mun Am

1
Ascending T'onggun Pavilion, I sit; the west wind brushes my face.
The fields gather the late autumn colors; birds return, carrying the setting sun.
How can the mountain elder be seen? The rock door is also always closed.
I envy that long river water; it never struggles to reach the sea.

2
T'onggun in former days built this pavilion; alone I ascend in late autumn, and sorrow turns and grows.
The mountains offer limitless scenery through the four seasons; the river holds the sounds of injustice (不平) from a thousand generations.
My graying temples have aged along with the yellow leaves; wild geese from the border are distant specks across the setting sun.
My old friend's feelings, what are they like now? I rejoice in the single bright line of Tonggwang (東光, Eastern Light). <83>

**Summary**

These two short poems, written in Classical Chinese (Hanmun), describe the poet's feelings upon visiting the historic T'onggun Pavilion in autumn. The poet expresses a sense of melancholy, isolation, and the passage of time, contrasting personal limitations with the freedom of nature (the river) and reflecting on historical grievances evoked by the location. The final lines offer a glimmer of hope, finding solace or optimism in "Tonggwang" (Eastern Light), which significantly is also the name of the magazine publishing the poem. For historians, the poems reflect the mood of intellectuals during the colonial period – a mix of sorrow over the national situation and personal aging, combined with a subtle yet persistent hope for enlightenment or a brighter future, perhaps symbolized by contemporary intellectual movements or publications like *Tonggwang* itself. The connection between personal feeling, historical reflection, and a contemporary symbol of hope (the magazine) is particularly noteworthy.

秋日登統軍亭 寄故人 2首
						文巖
登統軍亭坐 西風拂我顔
野收秋色晩 鳥帶夕陽還
山翁何得見 巖戶亦常關
羡彼長江水 不曾到海難

統軍昔日建斯亭 獨上高秋恨轉生
山送四時無限景 江含千代不平聲
蒼鬂己隨黃葉老 塞鴻遙斷夕陽橫
故人心緖今何似 我喜東光一線明＜83＞
