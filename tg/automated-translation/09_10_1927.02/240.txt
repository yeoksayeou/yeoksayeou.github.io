Mountain

Mother, you say
That mountain is high, so high,
Just how high is it?

If you were to walk up it,
It would take a whole day.

If that takes a whole day,
Mother, my finger,
How many days would it take? (2.3)<65>

**Summary**

This short children's poem (童謠 - tongyo) depicts a simple dialogue between a child and their mother about the height of a mountain. The child asks how high the mountain is, and the mother replies it would take a day to climb. The child then innocently compares this scale to their own finger, asking how many days it would take for their finger to "climb" it, showcasing a child's naive perspective on size and time. From a historical perspective, this piece offers insight into the simple themes and language used in children's literature during the colonial period in Korea. It reflects an innocent curiosity and a focus on everyday observations, potentially serving as a gentle, apolitical piece within the context of the time.
