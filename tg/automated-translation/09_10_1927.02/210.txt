**Body Text Translation:**
To Those Who Wish for Manuscript Correction (글의 添削을 願하는 이에게)

Many submissions come in from readers (讀者). To look at each one individually takes time, but to just leave them be is regrettable to those who wrote them with sincerity (情誠). Therefore, we have established a Correction Department (添削部) with the following regulations (規定).

Correction Department Regulations (添削部 規定)

1.  Manuscripts (原稿) should be written on one side only, leaving plenty of blank space (餘白), and "Correction" (添削) should be written in red ink (朱書) on the envelope (皮封).
2.  Address and Name must be written at the very end (末端) of the manuscript.
3.  For each manuscript page (20 characters x 10 lines), the enclosure (同封) of 10 *chŏn* (銭) (either postage stamps (郵票) or a postal money order (郵換)) is required (要함). This covers (充함) the correction fee and return postage (返送費).
4.  Manuscripts will be corrected, critiqued (批評), and returned (返送) within 30 days from the date of arrival (到着日).
5.  If registered mail (登記) is required upon return, an additional 10 *chŏn* for the registration fee must be sent along (添送).
6.  This company (本社) bears no responsibility (責任) for loss (遺失) due to mail issues or natural disasters (郵便 天災).
7.  Among the submissions (投稿), if there is an excellent piece (佳作), it may be published (揭載) in this magazine (本誌上).

**Summary**

This article from the February 1927 issue of *Tonggwang* magazine announces the establishment of a manuscript review and correction service for readers. It details the specific rules for submission, including formatting, providing contact information, the fee (10 *chŏn* per page via stamps or money order), the 30-day turnaround time, options for registered return mail, and disclaimers regarding postal loss. It also mentions that outstanding submissions might be published, and lists prominent contemporary writers Yi Kwangsu and Chu Yohan as the selectors/reviewers. From a historical perspective, this piece is interesting as it shows a formal mechanism for literary mentorship and feedback operating on a paid basis during the colonial period. It highlights the practical costs involved, the reliance on the postal system, and the significant role figures like Yi Kwangsu and Chu Yohan played not just as writers but also as gatekeepers or mentors within the literary scene.
