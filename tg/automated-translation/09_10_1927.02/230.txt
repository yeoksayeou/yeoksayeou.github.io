Let's Go Pick Greens

Under the wall, the butterbur sprouts (머우아재)
Have come up.

Little baby in the house in front,
What are you doing?
To the back mountain (뒤ㅅ뫼) to pick greens,
Won't you go?

The spring breeze softly blows (사르르),
The day is warm (다순데),
Holding baskets, in red skirts,
They're picking first. (3.12)<65>

**Summary**

This short children's song invites a child to join others in picking wild spring greens (namul), specifically mentioning butterbur sprouts near a wall and others already picking on the warm, breezy day on the back mountain. The poem evokes a simple, idyllic scene of rural springtime activity. From a historical perspective, the poem reflects everyday life and seasonal customs in colonial Korea, focusing on nature and children's activities. Its gentle tone and focus on traditional food gathering could be seen as a subtle representation of Korean culture persisting during a period of external rule.
