Folk Song (Popular in Kyŏngsang Province)
Ch'angwŏn, Chang Kwŏn-dong

With a jingle-jangle, tinkle-tinkle,
Wearing a sword, bright and colorful,
Standing in the *saerung* room,
They give me a peach.
Not eating that peach,
I buried it by the main road.
The departing old magistrate,
The arriving new magistrate,
Saying it tastes good, they picked and ate them all,
Saying it looks good, they picked and ate them all.
My little sibling Sunnim
Cries because they didn't give her any.
Baby, baby, don't cry,
When they grow next year,
I'll send them wrapped in bundles.

Folk Song (Popular in Kyŏngsang Province)
Chang Kwŏn-dong

Twin gold, twin gold, twin rings,
Quickly polished clean.
Looking far away, it seemed to be the moon,
Looking nearby, it was a young woman.
In the room where that young woman sleeps,
There seemed to be the sound of two breaths.
You misheard, dear brother,
Please don't speak falsely.
The east wind blew in,
It's the sound of the paper screen rattling.
Having taken nine kinds of medicine,
Hanging myself by three *cha* and three *chi* [approx. 1 meter],
When I die as if sleeping,
Don't bury me on the front mountain,
Don't bury me on the back mountain,
Please bury me in the lotus pond.
If I become a lotus flower,
Think of me and come look.

Children's Song (Popular in Chinju Region)
Kim U-sŏp

The mouse, the mouse sleeps in its hole,
The bird, the bird sleeps in the tree,
The bride, the bride, the pretty bride,
Sleeps in her husband's arms.
A young girl like me,
Sleeps in my mother's arms.

Children's Song (Popular in P'yŏngan Province)
P'yŏngyang R, A-saeng

One Royal Court, Two Princes of the Blood,
Samgak Mountain is a place of death.
Before Five Hundred years pass,
The Six Ministers grieve.
Famine strikes the Seven Provinces,
The Eight-Talented Master Chŏng,
To see the Nine-Layered Royal Palace,
Comes and goes on the Crossroads Street <60>

**Summary**

This article presents four songs collected from different regions of Korea in 1927: two folk songs (minyo) from Kyŏngsang Province and two children's songs (tongyo) from Chinju and P'yŏngan Province respectively. The songs cover themes of daily life, sibling affection, suspected infidelity and despair, simple observations of sleeping places, and a counting rhyme with potential historical or political undertones referencing the Joseon Dynasty and hardship. From a historical perspective, this collection is valuable for preserving regional oral traditions and dialects from the colonial period. The P'yŏngan Province children's song, with its references to the court, officials, famine, and a potentially messianic figure (Chŏng Toryŏng), is particularly interesting as it might reflect popular sentiment or veiled commentary on the state of affairs or historical memory during that time.

民謠(慶尙道地方流行)
昌原 張權東

자지찰랑 저찰랑에
알숭달숭 칼을차고
새룽방에 섯다가니
북숭하나 주는거로
그복숭을 아니먹고
한길가에 묻었더니
내리가는 구관삿도
올라가는 신관삿도
맛좋다고 다따먹고
빛좋다고 다따먹고
우리동생 순님이는
안준다고 울고가네
아가아가 울지마라
명년에는 열거들랑
봉지봉지 보낼꺼마

民謠(慶尙道地方流行)

쌍금쌍금 쌍까락지
호닥질러 닦아내어
먼데보니 달일러니
곁에보니 처자ㄹ러라
그처자라 자는방에
숨소리가 둘일러라
헛들었소 오라버님
거즛말슴 말으소서
동풍이- 들이불어
풍지떠는 소릴러라
아홉가지 약을먹고
석자셋치 목을매어
자는듯이 죽거들랑
앞산에도 묻지말고
뒷산에도 묻지말고
연못안에 묻어주소
연꽃이나 되거들랑
날만여겨 돌아보소
