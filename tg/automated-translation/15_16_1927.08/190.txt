The Heart Received from Nim
						秦雨村

On Tano Day,
The heart that Nim gave me then,
In the many days that have passed,
I feel the shame of having soiled it with temptations of this sort;
I intend to wash it clean again by offering it back to Nim.<59>

To the human who betrayed Nim,
The foolishness of boasting of that heart received from Nim—
Raising a cup of disappointment and self-destruction,
I consoled a secret resentment.

Ah, but the temptations of the songs and laughter
Of this land that scorns Nim
Intoxicated my cup filled with much resentment;
That heart received from Nim became dirtier still.

Ah, on this day, following the example
Of the ancient people who washed that heart in the clear river water,
Now I too intend to wash my defiled heart
By offering it back to Nim once more.

I offer this song to my dearest friend, Pak A-ji.<61>

**Summary**

This poem by Chin U-ch'on expresses deep remorse and a desire for purification. The speaker laments having defiled a precious "heart" (mind/spirit) received from "Nim" (a term that could signify a beloved, a leader, or the nation) through succumbing to temptations and foolish pride, especially among those who betray or scorn Nim. The speaker finds solace only in drink, which further soils the heart due to the corrupting influences ("songs and laughter") of the surrounding society. Ultimately, drawing inspiration from ancient purification rituals, the speaker resolves to cleanse their sullied heart by rededicating it to Nim. From a historical perspective, the poem, written during the Japanese colonial period (1927), likely uses "Nim" to symbolize Korea or a national ideal. The themes of defilement, betrayal, societal temptation ("songs and laughter of this land that scorn Nim"), and the yearning for purification resonate with the struggles against collaboration, cultural assimilation, and the desire for national redemption felt by many Koreans under colonial rule. Historians might find the poem's allegorical expression of guilt, resistance, and hope for restoration significant.

님께 받은 마음
						秦雨村
端午날에
님께서 주신 그 때의 마음을
나는 지나 간 많은 날에
이따의 유혹에 더럽힌 부끄러움을
다시금 님께 받혀 씻으려 한다.＜59＞

님을 배반한 인간에게
님께 받은 그 맘을 자랑한 어리석음은
실망과 자폭의 술ㅅ잔을 들어
남모를 원한을 위로하였다.

아아 그러나 님을 시긔하는
이 땅의 노래와 웃음의 유혹이
한 많은 나의 술ㅅ잔을 취ㅎ게 하였나니
님께 받은 그 맘은 더 한겹 더러웠도다.

아아 이 날에 맑은 강물에
그 맘을 씻은 옛 사람을 본받아
이제 나도 나의 더럽힌 마음을
님께 받혀 다시금 씻으려 한다.

이 노래를 가장 친애하는 벗 朴芽枝께 올린다.＜61＞
＜59-60＞
