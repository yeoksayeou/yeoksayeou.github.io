Article Title: 錄「水滸」詩一首 (Recording a Poem from "Water Margin")
Author: 梁建植
Article Type: 시 (Poem)

The members of the Tonggwang Sa (東光社同人) were about to compile the "Cooling Off the Heat" issue (滌署號) and requested a humble manuscript (拙稿) from me. It was difficult to refuse their words repeatedly, so I agreed. However (顧), the heat grew more intense (暑益熾), and my affairs grew busier (事益忙), making me unable to keep my word (踐言). Yet, their demands for it became daily more diligent (索之日益勤). Who knew that the debt of one word regarding "Cooling Off the Heat" (滌署) would conversely turn into an ordeal of agonizing heat and intense sweat (苦炎劇汗)? Having no choice (不得已), I am recording and sending one poem from *Water Margin* (水滸傳), which I have cherished reading throughout my life. Whether it feels like boiling soup or waving a fan (湯煮扇搖), I leave it entirely to the reader to decide (一任覽者處焉).

The red sun blazes like fire,
Half the grain stalks in the fields are withered and scorched.
Within the farmer's heart, it feels like boiling soup,
While the sons of lords and grandsons of kings wave their fans. <18>

**Summary**

The author, Liang Kŏn-sik, apologizes to the editors and readers of *Tonggwang* magazine for submitting a quoted poem from the Chinese classic *Water Margin* instead of an original piece for their special summer issue. He explains he was prevented by the intense heat and his busy schedule, despite the editors' persistent requests. The chosen poem starkly contrasts the suffering of farmers under the scorching sun with the indifference of the idle elite. From a colonial history perspective, this piece is interesting as it shows an intellectual under pressure to contribute to a Korean cultural publication. The selection of this specific poem, highlighting social disparity and the suffering of the agricultural class versus the comfort of the elite, could be interpreted as an indirect commentary on the socioeconomic conditions in colonial Korea, where peasant hardship was widespread while colonial administrators and collaborating elites often lived in relative ease. The use of a classical Chinese text provides a seemingly apolitical vehicle for potentially resonant social critique.
