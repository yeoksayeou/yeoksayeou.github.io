July 6th, suffering from the sweltering heat,
Facing food, I try to eat a little but still cannot.
Every night I worry about scorpions emerging by themselves (自足蝎),
Moreover, after autumn begins, the flies multiply.
I feel frantic, wanting to shout loudly towards the east,
Official documents (簿書), why do they pressingly arrive one after another?
Looking south, green pines bridge a short ravine (短壑),
How I wish I could tread barefoot (赤脚) on layered ice (層冰)!<16>

**Summary**

This article presents a classical Chinese poem by the Tang dynasty poet Du Fu. Titled "July 6th" (七月六日), it vividly describes the poet's misery during intense summer heat: he suffers from the oppressive weather, loses his appetite, is bothered by scorpions and flies, feels overwhelmed by official duties, and desperately longs for coolness, contrasting his discomfort with a serene view of pines and imagining the relief of walking on ice. For historians, the publication of this specific Du Fu poem in a Korean magazine in 1927 highlights the continued appreciation of classical Chinese literature during the colonial period. The themes of suffering under oppressive conditions (heat, pests, burdensome duties) might have implicitly resonated with contemporary Korean readers experiencing hardships under Japanese rule.

杜甫詩
七月六日苦炎蒸 對食暫湌還不能
每愁夜中自足蝎 況乃秋後轉多蠅
東帶發狂欲大呌 簿書何急來相仍
南望靑松架短壑 安得赤脚踏層冰＜16＞
