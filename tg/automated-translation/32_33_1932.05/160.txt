訂正 (Correction)

Correction
In this magazine's April issue, page 79, lower section, under the title "Confidence and Arrogance (自信과 傲慢)," the fourth line's "믿어주지" (mitŏjuji - trust me/him/her) was a misprint for "믿어지지" (mitŏjiji - is believable/credible). We hereby correct it.
The same author listed as "Ihwa Women's College (梨花專門), Kim Ch'ang-je (金昶濟)" should be "Ihwa Girls' High School (梨花高普), Kim Ch'ang-je (金昶濟)"; we correct this as well.

Correction
In this magazine's April issue, page 78, lower section, the author of "Misplaced Belief (헛 믿는 性質)" was mistakenly listed; the correct author is Pak Ch'an-hŭi (朴瓚熙). We hereby correct it.<38>

**Summary**

This brief article is an errata notice correcting mistakes published in the previous month's (April 1932) issue of the *Tonggwang* magazine. It corrects a typographical error in an article titled "Confidence and Arrogance," changing a verb form. It also corrects the affiliation of the author Kim Ch'ang-je from Ihwa Women's College to Ihwa Girls' High School, and identifies Pak Ch'an-hŭi as the correct author for the article "Misplaced Belief," correcting a previous misattribution. For historians, these corrections offer specific details about contributors to Korean periodicals in the colonial era, their affiliations (particularly with educational institutions like Ihwa), and the topics being discussed, while also showing the editorial process of correcting errors.
