Apology

It is incredibly regrettable to the Hyŏngp'yŏngsa (衡平社) and society in general that, due to an error by one of our company employees, language insulting Hyŏngp'yŏngsa members was used in an article on page 90 of this magazine's April issue.

As people who hold full support (滿腔의 贊意) for the Hyŏngp'yŏng movement, we feel an even greater sense of responsibility (핵임감). We apologize to all members of the Hyŏngp'yŏngsa and the general public, and at the same time, we declare the retraction of the concerned language.

April 20, 1932

**Summary**

This short article is a formal apology issued by the Tonggwang Company (東光社), publisher of the *Tonggwang* magazine, for offensive language used against members of the Hyŏngp'yŏngsa (Leveling Society) in their April 1932 issue. The company expresses deep regret, affirms its support for the Hyŏngp'yŏng movement, and officially retracts the problematic statement. Historically, this apology is significant as it directly addresses the Hyŏngp'yŏngsa, an organization fighting severe social discrimination against the *paekchŏng* (outcaste) group in colonial Korea. It highlights the public nature of the struggle for rights and the sensitivity surrounding the issue, showing that even mainstream publications had to publicly account for discriminatory language against this marginalized group.
