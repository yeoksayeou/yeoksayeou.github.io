Where is Jiandao Headed, Special Feature on the Jiandao Problem
						Yu Kwangryŏl

An Overview of Jiandao
Recently, when one thinks of Jiandao (間島), one associates it with the Communist Party and the "Terror" Movement, but beyond that, the entire Jiandao area has historically had an inseparable relationship with Koreans. So, what kind of area is Jiandao? The vast region northeast of Baekdu Mountain (白頭山)—collectively referring to the three counties of Yanji (延吉), Helong (和龍), and Wangqing (旺淸)—is called Jiandao. Regarding the name Jiandao, there are various conflicting theories; it is unknown whether it is an inherent Korean word that Koreans have used since ancient times, whether the area was regarded as an island (島) and thus called Jiandao (間島, middle island), or whether it takes the character "墾" (gan, cultivate) from cultivation (起墾). In any case, in this area spanning about 100 *ri* north-south and 250 *ri* east-west, while only around 100,000 Chinese live there, 500,000 Koreans reside. In Yongjeongchon (龍井村), which can be called the central city of Jiandao, tens of thousands of Koreans live, forming a city completely centered around Koreans.

A Glimpse of History
In ancient times, during the Goguryeo (高句麗) period, the entire territory of Manchuria was owned by Koreans. Even after Goguryeo was annexed by the allied forces of Silla (新羅) and Tang (唐), surviving retainers of Goguryeo went to Manchuria and founded the state of Balhae (渤海國). After Balhae fell 226 years after its founding and the peninsula was unified under the Goryeo (高麗) Dynasty, Goryeo, in order to subjugate the Jurchens rampaging in the Jiandao area, dispatched Yun Gwan (尹瓘) with a large army of 160,000 in the 2nd year of King Yejong's reign. He developed the land over 700 *ri* north of the Duman River (豆滿江) and erected a stone monument on Seonchun Pass (先春嶺, present-day Anxian County [安縣] in North Manchuria [北滿]), inscribing "Territory of Goryeo (高麗之境)." Ancient records state, "There were inscriptions on all four sides of the monument, but the barbarians scraped them all off (碑之四面有書 皆胡人剝去)," <30> giving a glimpse into the mindset of the barbarians (胡人) conquered by Koreans.
As Yi Taejo (李太祖) rose to power along the banks of the Duman River, he paid close attention to this region. After ascending the throne, Yi Taejo had Tong Duran (佟豆蘭) pacify the Jurchens (女眞), bringing over 1,000 *ri* of Yanbao (?) into the state register. Afterwards, as the Jurchens grew powerful, seven commanderies (7鎭) were established during the reign of King Sejong (世宗) to govern them. During King Sejo's (世祖) time, Sin Sukchu (申叔舟) subjugated them. During the reigns of King Seongjong (成宗)
and King Jungjong (中宗), there were also campaigns to conquer the Jurchens. During King Seonjo's (宣祖) time, Sin Rip (申砬), the magistrate of Onseong Fortress (穩城府使), repelled them and received their surrender.
Thus, even after the founding of the Yi Dynasty, the Jurchens in Jiandao sometimes served Joseon as vassals and sometimes rebelled and were executed. During King Seonjo's reign, the "Noraci" (노라씨) clan among the Jurchens grew powerful, annexed various tribes, founded the state of Manchu (滿洲國), later became the Qing (淸) Dynasty, conquered China, and received the surrender of King Injo (仁祖) of Joseon. While annexing both China and Joseon, the Qing, wanting to include Baekdu Mountain—considered the mountain of the Qing Dynasty's origin—within its own borders from Joseon's territory, dispatched Muk Wangdŭng (穆枉登) in the 5th month of the 38th year of King Sukjong's reign (1712 AD). He arbitrarily erected a boundary monument (定界碑) on Baekdu Mountain, inscribed: "West is the Yalu (鴨綠), East is the Tumen (土門). Therefore, on the watershed ridge, this stone is erected as a record (西爲鴨綠, 東爲土門故, 於分水嶺上, 勒不爲記)." The failure to carefully examine whether the downstream course of this Tumen River (土門江) encompassed the Jiandao area subsequently became a long-standing diplomatic issue between Joseon and Qing (韓淸國交問題). This is because if one follows the downstream course of the Tumen River, the entire Jiandao area falls within Joseon's territory. Furthermore, around 60 years ago, during the *sasa* and *gyeongo* years (corresponding to 1869-1870), a great famine struck Hamgyeongbuk-do (咸北) in Joseon, leading to hundreds of thousands migrating to Jiandao. The Qing government demanded that the Joseon government promptly repatriate the Joseon immigrants, but the majority of immigrants refused. The border issue became even more complicated, and although Joseon held several negotiations with Qing, each side stubbornly insisted on its own territory and did not yield. <31>

**Summary**

This 1932 article by Yu Kwangryŏl provides an overview of Jiandao (Gando), a region northeast of Baekdu Mountain heavily populated by Koreans despite being nominally Chinese territory. It recounts the historical connection of the area to Korea, starting from Goguryeo and Balhae, through Goryeo's expansion under Yun Gwan, and Joseon's interactions with the Jurchens. The author emphasizes the 1712 Baekdusan boundary monument erected by Qing official Muk Wangdŭng, arguing the ambiguity surrounding the "Tumen River" mentioned on the stele is the root of the ongoing border dispute, as Korea traditionally understood it differently, placing Jiandao within its borders. The article notes the large-scale Korean migration in the mid-19th century further complicated the issue. From a Korean colonial history perspective, the article is interesting as it clearly articulates the Korean nationalist view of Jiandao's history and territorial rights during a period of Japanese rule. It highlights the long-standing Korean presence and historical claims, framing the border dispute and the significant Korean population as key factors, implicitly challenging both Chinese sovereignty and potentially Japanese indifference or manipulation of the issue.

間島는 어데로 가나, 間島問題 特輯
						柳光烈
間島의 槪觀
間島라 하면 최근에는 共産黨을 聯想하고 『테로』 運動을 聯想하게 되지만 그 외에 間島 一帶는 歷史的으로 朝鮮人과 不可分의 관계가 잇다. 그러면 間島는 어떠한 地帶인가. 白頭山 東北便의 廣漠한 地帶=延吉, 和龍, 旺淸의 3縣을 總稱하야 間島라 한다. 間島의 名義에 대하야는 諸說이 區區하야 이것이 朝鮮人이 古來부터 불러오든 固有한 朝鮮語인지 또는 그 一帶를 島로 看做하고 間島라고 부름인지 또는 起墾의 『墾』 字를 取함인지 알 수 없으나 何如間 南北間 100여里 東西 250里의 地帶에는 中國人이 僅僅 10萬 內外가 삶에 反하야 朝鮮人은 50萬이 居住하고 間島의 中央都市라 할 만한 龍井村에는 朝鮮人口가 數萬이 살아 宛然히 朝鮮人 중심의 都市를 形成하엿다.

歷史의 一瞥
古昔 高句麗時代에는 滿洲 全土가 朝鮮人의 所有이엇으며 그 후 高句麗가 新羅와 唐의 聯合軍에게 倂合된 후에도 高句麗의 遺臣이 滿洲에 가서 渤海國을 創建하엿고 渤海가 建國된지 226年만에 망하여 半島는 高麗王朝로 統一된 후에도 間島一帶에 跳梁하는 女眞을 征服하기 위하야 高麗 睿宗 2年에 尹瓘이 16萬 大兵을 거느리고 가서 豆滿江 以北 700餘里를 開拓하는 동시에 先春嶺(今 北滿 安縣) 上에 石碑를 세우고 『高麗之境』이라고 색이엇는데 古記를 보면 『碑之四面有書 皆胡人剝去』라 한＜30＞ 것을 보아 朝鮮人에게 征服된 胡人의 心事를 엿볼 수 잇엇다.
李太祖가 豆滿江 沿岸에 勃興하니만큼 이 방면에 用心하야 太祖 卽位 후에 佟豆蘭을 식혀 女眞을 鎭撫하니 延褒 1,000餘里가 모다 그 版籍에 들어 갓엇다. 그 후에도 女眞이 旺盛하므로 世宗 時에는 7鎭을 設하야 統治하엿섯고 世祖 때에는 申叔舟가 討代한 일이 잇엇고 成宗
中宗 때에도 女眞을 征伐한 일이 잇고 宣祖 때에는 穩城府使 申砬이 擊退受降하엿다.
이러케 李朝된 후에도 間島에 잇는 女眞이 朝鮮에 臣事하기도 하고 謀叛被斬되기도 하다가 宣朝 때에 女眞 중 『노라씨』 一族이 旺盛하야 諸部落을 倂合하고 滿洲國을 建設한 후 다시 淸國이 되어 征服하고 朝鮮 仁祖의 降을 받앗엇다. 이러케 中國과 朝鮮을 倂合하는 동시에 間島를 朝鮮의 地界에선 白頭山을 淸朝發祥의 山이라 하야 自國의 境界 內로 그 山을 넣고자 肅宗 38年(西紀 1712) 5月에 穆枉登을 시기어 白頭山上에 自意대로 定界碑를 세우고 『西爲鴨綠, 東爲土門故, 於分水嶺上, 勒不爲記』라고 하엿는데 이 土門江의 下流가 間島一帶를 句括한 것인지 아닌지를 詳審히 아니한 것이 그 후 오랫동안 韓淸國交問題가 되엇다. 土門江의 下流를 쫓아가면 間島一帶가 朝鮮의 版圖로 들어오기 때문이니 더욱 距今 60餘年前 巳巳 庚午年間에 朝鮮 咸北에 大凶이 들어서 間島에 移住한 者가 數十萬에 達하니 淸國에서는 速히 朝鮮移民을 刷還하라고 朝鮮政府에 요구하엿으나 多數移民은 이를 不肯하고 國境問題는 더욱 複雜하게 되어 朝鮮에서는 淸國과 數次 談判이 잇엇으나 각각 自領을 固執하고 讓步치 않엇다.＜31＞
