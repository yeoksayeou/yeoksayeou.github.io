Hindenburg re-elected President of Germany at age 85. Though old age may bring vigor, it's a pitiful state if Germany, which is falling apart, has no one else to sustain it but this old man.

His Excellency Prime Minister Inukai had a hard time with the Kuhara faction due to the replacement of Home Minister Nakahashi, and was scolded by Army Minister Araki over the issue of replacing the President of the South Manchuria Railway. Old man Inukai should probably visit Marshal Hindenburg's shrine and offer prayers.

Taking the Shanghai Incident as a rare opportunity, the foreign side has reportedly started their usual Greater Shanghai Movement. Don't they know that the existence of these stubborn foreigners, running wild thoughtlessly despite the rejection of the neutral zone plan, is one cause of the anti-foreign fever?

The Northern Korea Development Plan has finally been approved. The Governor-General has barely avoided losing face, so perhaps now is a good opportunity for resignation?

The Italian Fascist Supreme Council has resolved to cancel reparations. It seems the time has come for a pro-reparations Fascist movement to arise in France.

Due to the Manchuria problem, Fascism proliferated in Japan, and since the Shanghai Incident, such tendencies have become strong in China as well. <50> Adachi's attempt at a cooperative cabinet failed, but the desire for a strong government seems unlikely to cool.

As the recent economic recovery turns out to be an empty bubble and an era of disastrous slumps due to speculative reaction arrives, an era of disillusionment with the Seiyūkai cabinet emerges. One way or another, it only creates a favorable opportunity for the "National Socialist Party" (國民社會派).

The Danube Conference is being held in London. There is great potential for geographical confusion. In the end, it will likely become inconclusive due to Anglo-French confrontation.

While the conference may be inconclusive, the bankruptcy of the Danube riparian states is imminent. Are the politicians of Europe unable to decipher the writing on the wall, ultimately bringing ruin upon themselves?

Briand died fighting, and Lloyd George retired from politics before death. As the politicians of the Great War gradually fade away, there's concern that new politicians who don't know the taste of war might enjoy playing war games.

An American named Baro is said to have discovered a new weapon that can detonate and disable warship cannons from hundreds of miles away. Shouldn't the Disarmament Conference abolish the noisy expert committees and just have one Baro committee member to solve everything?

Former Governor-General General Yamanashi was acquitted even in the retrial. Even if acquitted, having been under suspicion is socially equivalent to being guilty. <51>

The Kyŏngsang Hapdong Bank (慶尙合銀) is re-enacting its takeover battle. There's talk of a merger with Tongil Bank (東一銀行). If a merger strengthens it and eradicates internal strife, then a merger is acceptable.

The search drama for the "pistol youth" lasted six days. After catching him, it turned out he was outside the net. The search headquarters lost heart, as a certain newspaper headline aptly put it.

Manchukuo says it won't admit Ku Wei-chün (顧維均), while the Nanjing side insists on sending him in. In the middle, Japan acts as mediator. Lord Lytton should surely realize from this that Japan and Manchukuo have no mutual relationship whatsoever. His discernment seems likely to be judged by this.

The US House of Representatives passed the Philippine independence bill. The Senate is likely to pass it too. And then, the President is expected to veto it later. This too is a rather insipid theatrical performance.

Even as the Shanghai ceasefire conference breaks down, it still drags on. How about keeping Minister Shigemitsu and Kuo T'ai-ch'i (郭泰琪) tied up in negotiations slowly until their hair turns white?

The wealthy Mr. Kim (金富豪), who generously donated 5,000 *sŏk* worth to take over Posŏng College (普專), has probably set a new record for Chosŏn with his donation. May someone come along to break such a record often.

Thieves broke into an ancient tomb in Kangso. Nothing was taken, only the historical site was damaged. It's sorrowful enough to be starving, but to be foolish as well! <52>

**Summary**

This article presents a series of brief, critical commentaries on various international and domestic political events in early 1932. Topics include the re-election of Hindenburg in Germany, political troubles for Japan's Prime Minister Inukai, the Shanghai Incident and foreign ambitions, Italian and potential French fascism, the rise of fascism in Japan and China due to the Manchurian situation, economic downturn in Japan, the Danube Conference, the fading of WWI-era politicians, a supposed new American weapon, the acquittal of former Governor-General Yamanashi, a bank merger dispute in Korea, the failure to capture a fugitive, the diplomatic standoff over Manchukuo involving China and Japan, the likely symbolic passage of Philippine independence in the US, stalled Shanghai ceasefire talks, a large donation to Posŏng College in Seoul, and the desecration of an ancient tomb in Kangso. For historians, the piece offers insight into contemporary Korean intellectual views on global power dynamics, Japanese political fragility and militarism, the unfolding Manchurian crisis, colonial administration issues (Yamanashi, Northern Korea plan), and social commentary on events within Korea (banking, education funding, crime) under Japanese rule, all conveyed with a cynical and critical tone.

針大棒小
힌덴부륵이 85세로 獨逸大統領에 再選. 비록 老益壯이라 하나 이 老人 없이는 묺어저 가는 獨逸을 지탱할 사람이 없다 하면 可憐한 일.

犬養總裁閣下는 中橋內相 更迭로 久原一派에게 혼이 뜨고 滿鐵總裁更迭問題로 荒木陸相에게 야단을 만낫다. 犬養老人, 힌 元師의 祉堂을 모시고 祈禱를 올려 볼 일이다.

上海事件을 奇貨로 外人側에서는 例의 大上海運動을 開始햇다고. 中立地帶案이 一蹴된데 不拘하고 멋모르고 날뛰는 此等 頑强外人의 存在가 排外熱의 一原因인 것을 모르는가.

北朝鮮開拓案이 겨우 承認되엇다. 總督의 面目도 겨우 損失을 免햇으니 요 때가 辭免의 好機가 아닐까.

伊太利 파씨스트 最高會議는 賠償消却을 決議. 佛蘭西에서 賠償擁護의 파씨스트運動이 일어날 때가 된 모양인데.

滿洲問題로 日本의 파씨스트가 簇生이러니 上海事變 以來로 中國에도 그런 傾向이 濃厚. ＜50＞ 安達의 協力內閣劇은 敗햇지마는 아직도 强力 政府 希望熱은 식지 않을 모양.

今再禁景氣가 空泡로 돌아가고 投機反動의 慘落時代가 오니 政友內閣에 대한 幻滅時代 出現. 그래 저래 「國民社會派」의 好機만 作成.

倫敦서 다늅會議를 開催. 地理 混同의 慮가 多大하다. 결국은 英佛對立으로 有耶無耶.

會議는 有耶無耶지마는 다늅沿岸 諸國의 破産은 目捷에 잇다. 歐洲의 政治家는 壁上의 豫言書를 解得치 못하고 결국은 自招自滅乎.

브리앙은 싸우면서 죽고, 로이드조지는 죽기 前에 政界를 隱退. 이럭저럭 大戰政客이 漸沒落하니 戰爭 맛 모르는 新政客들이 戰爭遊戱를 즐길가봐 걱정.

米國人 바로는 수백哩 밖에 잇는 軍艦 大砲를 爆破하야 無用으로 돌아가게 하는 新武器를 발견햇다 한다. 軍縮會議는 모름직이 시끄러운 專門委員會 廢止하고 바로委員 1人이면 萬事 解決될 것 아닌가.

前 總督 山梨大將은 覆審에서도 無罪判決. 無罪라도 嫌疑만 받은 것이 社會的으로는 有罪.＜51＞

慶尙合銀은 또 爭奪戰을 再演. 東一銀行에 合倂說이 잇다. 合倂으로 튼튼케 된다면 內紛이 絶種된다면 合倂도 可.

拳銃靑年 搜索劇 6日. 잡고 보니 그물 밖이라. 搜索本部는 떡심이 풀렷다고 某紙의 題目이 그럴듯.

滿洲國은 顧維均을 안들인다고 南京側은 기어코 들여 보겟다고. 그 중간에서 日本은 仲裁를 한다고. 이걸 보고 리튼卿은 日本과 滿洲國이 相互間 何等 관계가 없다는 것을 惶然大覺해야 할텐데 卿의 頭腦의 明敏與否가 이것으로 判明할 듯.

米國 下院에서 比島獨立案을 可決. 上院도 可決할 듯. 그리고 나종에 大統領이 不決豫定. 이것도 一幕의 演劇으로 좀 승거운 걸.

上海의 停戰會議決裂하면서도 아직도 끌고 간다. 重光公使과 郭泰琪의 兩君, 白髮날 때까지 느직이 잡아 둠이 如何.

5,000石 뚝 떼에서 普專을 引受한 金富豪 돈 내놓은 것으로로 아마도 朝鮮 新記錄. 이런 記錄이면 작고 깨트릴 사람이 나오라.

江西古憤에 절도가 侵入. 가저간 것은 없고 古蹟만 損傷. 배 곯은 것만도 섫은데 머리까지 곯앗구나.＜52＞
＜50-52＞
