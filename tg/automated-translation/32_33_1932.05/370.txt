Spring Song
						Chang Man-yŏng

In the deep forest smithy,
Oh, dear young lady!
To the mountains and the fields,
Spring has come.

Even on the tips of trees,
Forgotten following their names,
Pretty flower buds
Are sprouting out.

Even in the clear water
Scooped with a gourd dipper,
The light of spring fully
Shimmers.

Tomorrow, to the front field
To gather herbs,
My dear, won't you go
With me?<12>

**Summary**

This short poem by Chang Man-yŏng, recommended by An Sŏ (likely Kim Ok), evokes the gentle arrival of spring in the Korean countryside. Using simple imagery like a forest smithy, budding trees, clear water, and gathering herbs, the speaker invites a "dear young lady" to join in celebrating the season. The poem presents a lyrical and somewhat idyllic scene. From a historical perspective, the poem offers a glimpse into the pastoral and potentially apolitical literary expressions during the Japanese colonial period. While not overtly political, its focus on nature and simple rural life could be seen as a subtle assertion of Korean cultural identity or an escape from the harsher realities of colonial rule. Historians might find it interesting as an example of lyrical poetry published in a mainstream journal during a period of significant political and social constraint.

봄노래
						張萬榮
깊은 숲 대장깐에
귀여운 아가씨여!
산에도 들에도
봄은 왓습네.

이름 좇아 잊어진
나무 끝에도
어여쁜 꽃봉이
솟아 나옵네.

바가치로 떠내는
맑은 물에도
봄빛이 가득이
히룽거립네.

내일은 앞들로
나물 뜯으러
그대여 나하고
안가려는가?＜12＞
