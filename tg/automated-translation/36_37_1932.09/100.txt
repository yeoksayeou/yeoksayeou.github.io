Passionate Rhymes, Snowy Lines
						Pak Kŭm

You dwell in green mountains, gathering ferns and sipping broth,
You should understand the words of the blue pine and white clouds.

The clouds are white, white—your heart is like snow;
The pine is green, green—your resolve is naturally pure.

Resolve naturally pure, severed from profit and desire;
Heart like snow, appearance and conduct are sternly upright.

Appearance and conduct sternly upright, chest filled with boiling blood;
Profit and desire empty and severed, belly filled with the cold moon.

The moon is cold, cold—this is clear wisdom;
Blood boils, red, red—this is heroism.

The hero upholds righteousness, his name never perishes;
The wise man loves truth, his nature is without flaw.

True teachings, profound laws—read Laozi;
Right principles, the Way—rely on the path of Taigong.

Living in the mountains, clear and empty, eating ferns;
Forever結与结与結与结与结与结與 (結與) the blue pine and white clouds.

White clouds sometimes turn into thunderous gales;
Blue pine, at year's end, stands with great integrity.

A true man possesses only these two secrets:
Is it to emulate the peach and plum, pleasing for a moment?
<14>

**Summary**

This Hanja-heavy poem, "Passionate Rhymes, Snowy Lines," praises an unnamed individual (likely a scholar or figure admired by the author) living a reclusive life in the mountains. The poet uses imagery of green pines, white clouds, snow, and the moon to symbolize the subject's purity, integrity, wisdom, and detachment from worldly desires (profit, desire). The subject's character is likened to the steadfastness of the pine tree and the clarity of the wise (明哲) and heroic (豪傑), drawing inspiration from classical figures like Laozi (老子) and Jiang Ziya (太公). The poem contrasts this enduring virtue with the fleeting beauty of peach and plum blossoms, questioning temporary appeal. For historians, the poem reflects an admiration for traditional virtues like integrity, resilience, and detachment during the colonial period. It showcases the continued relevance of classical Chinese literary traditions and philosophical ideals (Daoism, Confucianism) among Korean intellectuals as a source of moral guidance or perhaps a form of subtle resistance or withdrawal from the socio-political realities under Japanese rule. The emphasis on inner purity and steadfastness (志自潔, 大節) might be interpreted as a coded message valuing Korean identity and spirit over collaboration or assimilation.

熱韻雪句
						朴錦
君居碧山採薇啜
應知靑松白雲說

雲白白兮心如雪
松靑靑兮志自潔

志自潔而利欲絶
心如雪而表儀烈

表儀凜烈胸湯血
利欲空絶腹冷月

月冷病病卽明哲
血湯赤赤是豪傑

豪傑秉義名不滅
明哲好眞性無缺

眞敎法玄老子閱
義理道憑太公轍

山居淸虛且食蕨
長與靑松白雲結

白雲時或作雷颲
靑松歲晩立大節

男兒唯有此二訣
是効桃李一時悅
