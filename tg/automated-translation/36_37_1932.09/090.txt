The Depression and the Student World
The impact of the economic depression (經濟恐慌) on the Korean student community in America (在米) is multi-layered.
For students who used to receive $75 a month from home (本家) to supplement their tuition, due to the collapse of the exchange rate (爲替), this has dropped to less than one-third. $75 is now only worth $20. On top of that, schools, facing financial difficulties, have abolished (撤廢) their tuition loan systems (貸費制度), and employers who provided work are letting people go. The Immigration Bureau (移民局) will immediately repatriate students to their home country if they are found to be only working under student status (學生身分).
It is said that in the past 50 years, there has never been a time when the livelihood of Korean students was as difficult as it is now.

International Youth Conference (萬國靑年大會)
Taking the opportunity of the Olympic Games, an international student group federation conference (萬國學生集團 聯合大會) from various universities is scheduled to be held in Los Angeles. The conference duration is two weeks, and its purpose (目的) is to promote understanding (理解) and friendship (親善) among different peoples (各民族間).
Mr. Kwŏn George (권쬬지), a Korean student enrolled at the University of California (칼리포니아대학), is said to have been elected as the Vice-Chairman of Representatives for the conference. <13>

**Summary**

This article reports on three news items concerning Korean students in the United States in 1932. First, it lists the newly elected officers of the "2-8 Club," an organization for second-generation Koreans in Los Angeles. Second, it details the severe financial hardships faced by Korean students due to the Great Depression: drastically reduced funds from home because of unfavorable exchange rates, the cancellation of school loan programs, loss of part-time jobs, and the threat of deportation if caught working improperly. It notes this is the most difficult period for Korean students in 50 years. Third, it mentions an upcoming International Youth Conference in Los Angeles, timed with the Olympics, and the election of a Korean student, Kwŏn George, as a key representative. For historians, the article vividly illustrates the precarious economic situation of colonial Korean students abroad during a global crisis, highlighting the compounding effects of the Depression, exchange rate fluctuations, and restrictive immigration policies. It also shows student community organizing (the 2-8 Club) and participation in international forums despite these hardships.

恐慌과 留學界
경제공황으로 在米 유학생계가 받는 타격은 이중삼중이다.
본집에서 월 75불의 학비를 가저다가 보태쓰든 학생이 爲替시세의 폭락으로 3분지 1 이하로 떠러젓다. 75불이 인제는 20불 밖에 못된다. 그런데다가 학교는 경비곤란으로 貸費제도를 撤發하고 일하는 주인집도 사람을 내보내기로 되엇다. 이민국에서는 학생신분으로 노동만 하는줄 알면 즉시 본국으로 송환한다.
과거 50년간에 지금처럼 조선학생의 살림이 곤란한 때가 전에 없엇다 한다.

萬國靑年大會
올림픽 대회를 기회로 로산젤리스에다가 각 대학에 잇는 만국학생집단의 연합대회를 열기로 되엇는데 회 기간은 2주간이요 목적은 각 민족간의 이해와 친선을 도하자는 것이다.
