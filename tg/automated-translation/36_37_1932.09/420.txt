Don't Speak
						Yi Wŏr'am

Don't speak, don't speak,
Don't speak of this world.
Speak one word, it goes a hundred li,
Speak two words, it goes a thousand li,
Don't speak of this world.

Don't speak, don't speak,
Don't speak of this world.
A word that went a hundred li is said to have gone a thousand li,
A word that went a thousand li is said to have gone ten thousand li,
Don't speak of this world. <95>

**Summary**

This short poem, written in a folk song style, warns against speaking carelessly about the world or others. It uses the traditional Korean distance unit 'li' to illustrate how words travel far and become exaggerated exponentially with each retelling. The poem advises silence as a way to avoid the harm caused by gossip and rumors. For historians, the poem reflects social anxieties about speech and reputation in colonial Korea. Its folk song style (민요체) and use of older grammatical forms and spellings like "말마르오," "철리," and "말리" offer linguistic insights into the period.
