Grass Leaf and Dew
						Uhyang (雨鄕)

Last night's dew gathered on the reed leaf,
In the morning light quietly blooming and rising
From within the mountain,
It smiles, sparkling like clear eyes.

The reed leaf holding the dew,
On that thin leaf,
My lips, just woken from sleep,
I wish to touch. <96>

**Summary**

This short lyrical poem by Uhyang describes the beauty of morning dew gathered on a reed leaf in the mountains at dawn. The dew is personified, sparkling like clear eyes and smiling. The speaker expresses a gentle desire to touch the dew-laden leaf with their newly awakened lips. From a historical perspective, the poem is notable for its focus on nature and delicate emotion, potentially representing an aesthetic escape or a continuation of traditional lyrical themes amidst the social and political realities of colonial Korea in the early 1930s. Its use of slightly older Korean orthography is also of linguistic interest.

풀닢과 이슬
						雨鄕
갈앙닢에 매친 간밤 이슬
고요히 피여솟는
산속의 새벽빛에
맑은 눈동자 반짝이며 우슴웃다
이슬 안긴 갈앙닢
엷은 닢에
자고난 나의 입술
대보고 싶음이어.＜96＞
