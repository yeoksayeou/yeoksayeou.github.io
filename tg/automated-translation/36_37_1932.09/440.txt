Where Has the Master Gone?
						Cho Chong-hyŏn

Perhaps they left, putting the young child first, carrying their bundles.
Perhaps the old man and woman left to earn a living.
Only those who have something could speak of crossing the barley hump.

Where has the master gone, leaving this house, where to?
There’s no sound of dogs or chickens; is there even a trace left?
The dew that fell last night has settled on the mugwort leaves.

Wanting to make a living and reside here, as it's below the ancestral graves.
Wanting to make a living and reside here, until fingernails and toenails wear down.
But perhaps they ended up leaving because there was no day labor to be found? <96>

**Summary**

This poem by Cho Chong-hyŏn laments the emptiness of a rural Korean house, whose inhabitants have seemingly departed due to extreme poverty. The speaker speculates that the family, including a child and elderly members, left to seek subsistence elsewhere, unable even to endure the 'barley hump' (spring famine). The poem paints a desolate picture of abandonment, silence, and the severed connection to ancestral land, highlighting the desperation caused by the lack of work ('품파리' - day labor). From a historical perspective, the poem offers a poignant glimpse into the harsh socio-economic conditions faced by Korean tenant farmers and rural populations during the Japanese colonial period in the early 1930s. It reflects themes of rural depopulation, poverty, and forced migration, which historians would find valuable evidence of the widespread hardship and social disruption under colonial rule.

주인은 어데로
						趙宗玄
어린 애 앞 세우고 보ㅅ짐지고 나갓겟다
영감 할멈이 벌어먹자 떠낫겟다
보리ㅅ고개 넘긴단 말도 잇는 이나 할 것을

주인은 어데메로 이집 두고 어데메로?
개, 닭 소리도 없네 자취나마 잇을것가
간밤에 나린 이슬이 쑥대닢에 매첫네

선산 밑이라 하야 벌어먹고 살고지고
손발톱 다 달토록 벌어먹고 살고지고
그러나 품파리도 없어 떠나가고 말엇는가? ＜96＞
