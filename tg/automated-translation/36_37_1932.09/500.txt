Pomegranate Flower
						Ko Hŭihwan (高熙煥)

Your outer flower.
Is mystical and pretty like an ancient immortal's flask,
Your inner flower.
Is bright like the conscience of a fluttering young child,
And inside it, lusterless gold dust is contained abundantly.<97>

**Summary**

This short poem by Ko Hŭihwan uses vivid imagery to describe the pomegranate flower. The outer part is compared to a beautiful, mystical flask belonging to an ancient immortal, while the delicate inner part is likened to the bright conscience of a child. Within this inner part lies abundant, yet dull, "gold dust," perhaps representing hidden potential or value. For historians, this poem from 1932 offers a glimpse into the lyrical sensibilities prevalent during the colonial period. Its focus on natural beauty and internal qualities, using traditional motifs like immortals alongside images of childhood innocence, might reflect an aesthetic or emotional refuge sought amidst the socio-political realities of the time.

석류꽃
						高熙煥
당신의 겉꽃은.
예ㅅ날 신선의 술병같이 묘하고 에뿌오며
당신의 속꽃은.
하늘거리는 어린 아해의 양심 같이 밝으온데
그속에는 광채 없는 황금가루가 소두룩하게 담겨 잇지오.＜97＞
