(Translator's Note: The following text includes an editorial introduction followed by the story "Sise Chŏn" [施賽傳], presented in Hanmun.)

**Editorial Introduction**

The *Sise Chŏn* introduced here is a truly refreshing piece of writing that personifies the common saying, "Sisidŏk rides the ridge, Saech'imdŏk takes the valley," delving into the essence of "Sisidŏk" and "Saech'imdŏk." Ticklish, deadly, incomparably exhilarating—we believe one can discover aspects of the human condition and the subtleties of human feeling within it. This is said to be a great work by Mr. Pyŏn Kwangho (Yŏngman) [卞光昊(榮晩)], famous for his social satire and literary skill, which he has ceaselessly revised, polished, and perfected over several years, leaving not a single word out of place. As Mr. Pyŏn plans to use this as a blueprint (藍本) to publish his creative short story "Strange Friends" (이상한 동무), what did his silence over these several years signify, and how indeed will it be expressed? Please look forward to Mr. Pyŏn's masterful work "Strange Friends," which will be published in the next issue of this magazine. —Editor

**The Tale of Si and Sae (施賽傳)**

Si Sidŏk (施時德) and Sae Ch'imdŏk (賽沉德) were both people of the Capital (京人). Their family lineages are both unknown. The two men were good friends. They often spent time together, sometimes even eating from the same bowl. However, their temperaments were vastly different. Their neighbors used to say, "When the sun rises in the west, then Master Si's mouth will close." They also said, "When Master Sae smiles, even a stone Buddha smiles." Generally, Si's character was broad-minded and open, holding nothing back. He enjoyed idle talk, grand pronouncements, strange analogies, and metaphors. Although he suffered much ridicule and abuse for shaking his head and rolling his eyes, he still did not stop himself. Sae, on the other hand, spent the whole day with his brow furrowed, staring at his seat. When forced to speak, he would barely manage one or two phrases. His words were also extremely faint and subtle, almost inaudible. For this reason, people generally found Sae's reserved quietness agreeable and grew weary of Si's behavior. Yet, people generally let down their guard around Si, while being very wary of Sae, saying, "This fellow will surely cause trouble one day." They would also discuss them comparatively: "Compared to climbing a mountain, Mr. Si is one who follows its <68> ridge. Mr. Sae is one who disappears into its valley. Following the ridge, everyone sees you. Disappearing into the valley, ah, how fearsome!"

Both men lost their wives in middle age. It was officially reported that both wives died of natural causes (天年), but in reality, Si's wife starved to death, and Sae's wife threw herself into a well. Sae, changing his clothes and looking slightly distressed (微窄 - perhaps 'narrowed eyes' or 'furtive'?), felt great resentment. He secretly placed needles in his wife's rice. His wife swallowed them, then realized. This was the origin of the well incident. Si hid nothing about almost everything, but regarding the needle-well incident, he absolutely never spoke a word. As a friend, he also kept the circumstances of his own wife's death secret, as if deeply ashamed of his poverty.

Since both were widowers (鰥), both wanted to remarry. They thus went around together, inside and outside the city walls, widely searching for prospects (廣物闕選矣 - widely assessing prospects?). However, whomever Si found pleasing, Sae would invariably find many ways to slander and obstruct, and then present himself as a suitor (自委禽焉 - offered himself like a bird caught in a net?). Then he would abandon her again. This happened with women from over forty households. Those whose faces showed particular resentment were also numerous. Yet, the two men went everywhere together. At this, His Majesty (主上) became enraged. The Royal Guard Commander (御營大將) did not return home for meals at night (宵不退食 - worked through the night). Patrol cavalry (邏騎) spread out in all directions, determined to capture this pair and execute them publicly in the main market square to appease the public. The two men thus had nowhere to lay their heads.

At that time, the harvests had been poor for years. Furthermore, a children's song went: "Sheep and fox walk together. Sheep is bold, fox pretends. Two-eight, two-eight (二八二八). Beware your open wall (愼爾坦墻矣)." Another went: "Higher and higher, yet never reaching heaven. Lower and lower, yet never entering the spring (泉 - underworld)." It was indeed a tumultuous time. They used bribes to hide by day in the cellar (窖中) of a tavern, traveling by night through deep mountains and dark forests, places devoid of human habitation. Reaching this state, even Mr. Si could not help but abandon the ridge (岡脊) and head for the valley (谷是趨). Sometimes he would laugh at himself, startling roosting birds, and Sae would curse lowly, "You're mad." Sae also sometimes sighed softly, "The house by the East Gate (東門)..." or sometimes, "Yŏndang (蓮堂) in the South Village (南村)..." His thoughts seemed attached to somewhere. Sometimes they both went a whole day without a single meal. They encountered great tigers and disturbed coiled snakes; they trod danger and risked death numerous times.

One night, the moon was extremely bright. They sat together in a rock cave, talking of old stories. They first met when Si was thirteen. He had lost his widowed mother and had no siblings. His mother used to say she dreamt of looking up at a great pine tree like a canopy (盖) and then became pregnant. Sae was a posthumous only child. At age four, his mother disappeared, whereabouts unknown. He was then raised by his maternal uncle. The uncle often cursed, "This child will later surely die violently in a strange land." Sae apparently spoke the most he ever had on this night.

They eventually wandered into a county in the northern region (關北 - Kwanbuk, i.e., Hamgyŏng Province). They rented a house (僦屋) to live there. The county was extremely far from the Capital, so no one had heard of them. Sae had managed to bring some funds, unlike Si who was penniless (一洗 - washed clean). By this point, Sae's funds were also nearly exhausted (垂盡矣). Thus, they bundled firewood together repeatedly to exchange for millet to survive (共捆屢易粟以活), with Si alone bearing most of the labor. Sae, meanwhile, was good at facing the wall for an afternoon nap.

One day, Sae woke from his nap and said to himself, "The world praises southern men and northern women. It's truly not false." Si threw down his tools (藝 - perhaps craftwork/tools for bundling wood?) and quickly asked Sae, "Do you still have the surplus courage (餘勇) to harbor thoughts of marriage? My hair is rapidly turning white. Guan Yin Bodhisattva (觀世音菩薩), please save me." Sae smirked (哂曰 - assumed character), "How could I mean myself? It's for your sake." Si laughed, "I have already received many favors. How could I dare hope for more? Besides, now is a good time. I wish to fully lay out my sad song. I have often followed behind you and had the chance to widely observe beauties. But in my heart, I always felt none were equal to my former wife. It's not about her appearance. My former wife was truly virtuous but ill-fated. Among these things, there are some unforgettable aspects, and also some worth recalling with sorrow. For instance, the daughter of Yŏndang (蓮堂). I once sincerely loved her and was not without intention. But then, remembering my former wife, the grief was uncontrollable. Nevertheless, since I was seeking her, I could not just run away. Thus, I fell into a situation where I could neither advance nor retreat. Whether you truly perceived this hidden pain or not, I certainly don't know. But thankfully, at that time, you skillfully fabricated excuses, painting me as the son of a dog butcher (屠狗之子), claiming I had epilepsy (癲癎). You thus extracted me from the entanglement (絆), and you married her, achieving convenience for both parties. For this, I am still endlessly grateful to you. However, you also did not love her for long, soon abandoning Yŏndang. Not only her, but it was the same with other women. Sir, your former wife, compared to my former wife, was her equal. Yet you were able to finally bury your former wife in the earth, but could not settle yourself even for three nights on the flowery patterned mat (華凡紋席) thereafter. The world calls you lacking in virtue (凉德), but I see you too can remember the past. Suppose I had married those you married; would there not ultimately have been a difference in timing, sooner <69> or later? In the end, it would have been the same as with you. Therefore, our plan today should be only eating and drinking. Women should not be discussed. You intended to painfully correct past errors to rescue my shortcomings, yet now you speak like this again. There's nothing good in it. Besides, the northern lands have harsh customs, unlike the south. If we were to defile a single household's daughter, our heads would surely be smashed." Si usually joked often, but on this day, his words were quite earnest and sincere, reaching the point of choking up. Sae also looked crestfallen, silently bowing his head. The talk of marriage thus ceased.

One day, Sae went out alone. He soon returned carrying a load on his shoulder (手一擔肩 - assumed character) and holding a pot of wine. Si asked in surprise where he got them. Sae replied coolly, slightly turning away (微反晨 - unclear phrase, possibly 'slightly averted his face' or 'muttered back'), "We just eat and drink." Si didn't ask further, but felt suspicious. They ate their fill together. Just then, a neighboring house had the incident of a missing silver ring; search yielded no trace. Soon, collective suspicion fell upon the newcomers, but they couldn't decide which one. Thereupon, both men were bound and taken to the magistrate.

The magistrate carefully looked at both men's faces. He first asked Sae Ch'imdŏk, "Was it your doing?" Sae bowed low (鞠躬) and said, "It was not. I did not do this." "Then was it Si Sidŏk?" Si arrogantly (昻然) replied, "Yes. It was me. Not this friend. Moreover, my crimes certainly don't stop here. I have secretly butchered over ninety cows. I have defiled the wives and daughters of three hundred fifty households. I once slapped my paternal uncle's (季父) cheek (顂). I once broke an old man's leg." As Si spoke thus, Sae, standing beside him, muttered (囁嚅而曰 - assumed character), "If you say it like that, it's unbelievable." At that moment, Si's mind was in turmoil, and he didn't have the leisure to hear this. He continued, "I have also set fires in seven places, beaten to death over twenty people. When staying overnight at inns, I always fled before dawn (昧爽). I always carried poison; upon finding a well, I always put some in. I also plotted treason (不軌), making a portrait of the nation's king and practicing archery on it daily in the mountains of Pukhan (北漢之山中) for three and a half years. Why just a ring (何只環也 - assumed character)? Sir, the sun does not shine everywhere; the wind does not penetrate everywhere. The donkey brays loudly." As Si spoke thus, Sae ground his teeth (切齒曰), "What about the donkey now?" Si heard this only then, but continued, "The donkey brays loudly. The deaf think the donkey is yawning. A woman of seven husbands and ten men (七夫十士之女 - likely meaning promiscuous), the neighbors still consider her a chaste wife. Officials report her name favorably; the governor requests her commendation (旌). The world is certainly full of such types. How can the magistrate possibly know all my sins? Today, my conscience has suddenly stirred (天良閃發); I confess all my past evils. I willingly accept the highest punishment (上刑) without any resentment. I only wish to be buried on a thousand-fathom high peak, so I may be slightly closer to the heavenly light (天光)." Si was eight feet tall, with broad features and eyes, his voice like a booming drum. The magistrate was stunned for a long while. Then he asked Sae again, "Is what Si says true?" Sae initially trembled (慄), then composed himself. He looked straight at the magistrate's face and said, "I dare not know about the rest, but regarding the ring incident, there is no doubt." The magistrate had already discerned something. He then fiercely beat Sae with a cane and finally obtained his confession (卒執其狀). He was sent down to prison.

Thereupon, Si knew nothing more could be done. He also regretted his exaggerated words. He wept bitterly and left. Unable to wait for his friend, he eventually returned alone to his old village. Those who had previously pursued him had also learned the complex details (曲折) of the situation and did not charge him. He then finally remarried and had a son. His habits gradually changed. He was careful about his companions and moderated his speech. His property also gradually grew prosperous (潤). Everyone said that good people are ultimately blessed.

Sae, in the northern prison, secretly communicated with a female prisoner, still following his Capital habits (猶京志也). Suspecting her of relations with others, he poisoned her. It was more severe than the needles (烈於針矣). He was subsequently sentenced to hanging (絞), and his corpse was discarded in a valley, fulfilling his uncle's words.

The Unofficial Historian (野史氏) says: I once went to the foot of Namsan (南山) to see the place Si and Sae called Yŏndang (蓮堂). The hall stands north of a lotus pond. Its structure (搆) is certainly small, but also secluded and tranquil (幽靚), utterly lovely. The residence is dilapidated; only this hall remains. But trying to imagine the elegant pursuits of the two men visiting here two hundred years ago, the dead lotus roots (死藕) are silent, only a sad wind blows in vain; it is also indistinct (杳然矣). The hall master (堂王 - likely means the woman of the house) at that time was called Myogun (妙君). At seventeen, she briefly shared Master Sae's pillow for about ten days. Later, she drowned herself in the pond, it is said. Sir Si (施子) was certainly not evil, but enjoying Sae's company (喜與賽子遊) was also his fault (咎). Suppose on that day, they had been caught by the patrol cavalry (邏騎), would there have been any distinction between jade and stone (玉石 - i.e., would the innocent Si have been spared)? Having suffered hardship and faced perils (困心歷危), he was able late in life to cover himself (自盖也 - reform/redeem himself). This was entirely luck. Master Sae (賽子) deserves no censure (無譏 - This seems ironic or understated); even today, his kind are not few. <70>

**Summary**

This Hanmun tale, *Sise Chŏn*, contrasts two friends from Seoul: the outgoing, boastful Si Sidŏk and the quiet, sinister Sae Ch'imdŏk. Sae secretly murders his wife with needles and later sabotages Si's attempts to remarry, taking the women himself only to abandon them. Their actions make them fugitives pursued by the King's guard. Hiding in the north, Sae steals a ring. When caught, Si delivers a wildly exaggerated false confession to numerous crimes to protect Sae, but Sae betrays him, confirming only the ring theft. Sae is imprisoned, poisons another woman, and is executed. Si, released and remorseful, returns home, reforms, remarries, prospers, and is seen as proof that good people are ultimately blessed. The narrator reflects on the site associated with one of their victims and notes Si's fortune in escaping Sae's fate, wryly observing that Sae's type persists.

From a colonial history perspective, the story, published in 1932 but set in an older, likely Chosŏn, period (King, Royal Guard Commander), offers social commentary possibly resonating with contemporary anxieties. The themes of betrayal, hidden evil behind a quiet facade (Sae), undeserved suffering (Si's first wife, Si himself), flight from authority, and eventual starkly contrasting fates (redemption vs. execution) might reflect the moral complexities and perceived injustices of the colonial era. The use of Hanmun for the story, presented as a blueprint for a modern Korean vernacular story, also highlights the linguistic and literary transition occurring in Korea at the time.

野史氏曰. 余嘗之南山下. 觀施賽所謂蓮堂者. 堂在蓮池之北. 其搆. 固小. 而亦幽靚絶可愛. 宅廢. 惟此堂存. 而欲想像二百年前二子登遊之風流. 則死藕無言. 悲風徒來. 亦杳然矣. 其時堂王曰妙君. 以十七歲. 嘗拂賽子之枕席者. 略有一旬之久. 後自沉池云. 夫施子. 固不惡. 喜與賽子遊. 要亦有咎. 假使當日. 爲邏騎所得. 寧有玉石哉. 困心歷危. 晩乃有以自盖也. 此具幸耳. 賽子無譏. 今亦其徒不鮮矣.＜70＞
