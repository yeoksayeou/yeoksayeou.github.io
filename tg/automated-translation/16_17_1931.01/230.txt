The Sinmi Revolution and the Sinmi Foreign Disturbance
						Yi Yunjae

Sinmi! Since Tangun, the year of Sinmi must have occurred 70 times. Among those, if one were to list the historically important major events that happened in Sinmi years, there would surely be quite many. However, let's set aside the very old facts for now and only take up the incidents that occurred in the most recent Sinmi and the Sinmi before that, as they appear in modern history. These two Sinmi incidents indeed make for an interesting and good contrast. One is an internal rebellion centered around Hong Kyŏngnae, and the other is a foreign invasion centered around Ch'oe Nan-hŏn. Both are sufficient to decorate a page of history with magnificence and vigorous activity. First, I shall speak of the Sinmi Revolution.

The Sinmi Revolution

I. What kind of person was Hong Kyŏngnae?
What kind of person was this exceptional child, Grand Marshal Hong Kyŏngnae of P'yŏngsŏ, who let out a cry of "Ua!" shattering the silence of the peninsula, intending to spew forth the righteous blood coagulated over 400 years and sweep away the filth that permeated the three thousand *ri*?
About 147 years ago from now, in the Kapchin year (Western calendar 1784, 8th year of King Chŏngjo of Chosŏn), in a corner of Sŏ-dong, Tami-myŏn, Yonggang County, P'yŏngan Province, the first cries of our hero, General Hong, were heard. From birth, his physique was extraordinary, his spirit noble and lofty, his bravery peerless, and his talents fully equipped, possessing the qualities of a hero. As a child, he went to the village school and studied the book called *T'onggam* (Comprehensive Mirror). When he reached the passage, "Ch'en Sheng stopped plowing and sighed, saying, 'If a valiant man does not die, fine; but if he dies, he should achieve great fame,'" he clenched his fist and exclaimed with admiration, "A man's ambition should rightly be like this." Seeing this, his teacher thought to himself, "Ah, this boy will cause great things in the future," and made a mental note. One day, also at the school, the teacher was smoking, holding his pipe and standing at the edge of the wooden floor (maru) lighting it. Kyŏngnae stealthily approached from behind and pushed him off. The teacher, greatly surprised, scolded him, but he replied calmly, "The opportunity was good, so I did it." Also, during the day, he studied with classmates at the school, and at night, he went alone to the mountains to learn swordsmanship and practice military formations. After some time, the teacher became aware of his activities. Knowing it wouldn't be enjoyable to stay there long, the next day he composed a poem, "Heaven and Earth intended to give birth to a man, Brush and inkstone have no heart to make a gentleman grow old" (乾坤有意生男子, 筆硯無心老丈夫), posted it on the wall <56> of the school, and vanished somewhere without a trace. Also, when he was young, he went to Seoul to take the state examination but failed. One day, watching the king's procession, he remarked, "Becoming king is better than passing the state examination." Although these are just a few anecdotes, they allow us to see how bold and magnanimous Hong Kyŏngnae's character was.

II. Motive for Revolution and Revolutionary Movement
During the 500 years of the Yi Dynasty Chosŏn, what was the so-called state of the nation? Despite suffering fatal wounds like the national disaster of the Imjin War and the national humiliation of the Pyŏngja Invasion, they still boasted of peace with civil officials complacent and military officers idle (文恬 武嬉). Unprecedented literati purges and factional strife staged great tragedies for 300 years. Moreover, the court's personnel appointments were extremely biased, treating individuals from the Northwest (Sŏbuk) with extreme disdain, reaching a point where it was said, "In civil posts, no higher than Chip'yŏng or Changnyŏng; in military posts, no higher than Sumunjang or Pujang." Furthermore, in recent times, maternal relatives of the king wielded power, bribery was rampant, state administration was in disarray, and consecutive years of poor harvests led to widespread distress (嗷嗷) among the populace, who did not know where to turn. At this time, wasn't there a single righteous man (義氣 男兒) to sweep this clean? Hong Kyŏngnae was the one who grasped his three-foot sword, rose up to eliminate the treacherous factions in the court, rescue the people fallen into misery, cried out for freedom and equality, shook his sleeves, and walked out the door.
Hong Kyŏngnae, harboring such unusually great ambitions, first traveled through the various counties of Ch'ŏngbuk (Northern P'yŏngan Province), befriending many people and secretly gathering numerous comrades. He met many heroes such as U Kunch'ŭk and Yi Hŭijŏ in Kasan, Hong Ch'onggak and Kim Ch'angsi in Kwaksan, Yi Chech'o in Kaech'ŏn, and Kim Sayong in Hwangju. Traveling through P'yŏngan and Hwanghae provinces, he used divination skills (道術) to connect with wealthy families and secure economic resources. At the same time, he bought several dozen top kisaeng (female entertainers) from P'yŏngyang, loaded them and musical instruments onto several large boats, and visited major cities and ports, holding festivities. From the tens of thousands of spectators, he selected strong men who stood out, brought them back, treated them with food and drink, distributed money and silk, and persuaded them with fine words to become his subordinates. Gathering forces in this way, he obtained over a thousand strong men within several months.

III. Ua! It's a Revolution!
Hong Kyŏngnae established his base in Tabok-tong, 10 *ri* east of Kasan county seat, trained his subordinates in military formations, manufactured weapons, and his grand plan proceeded smoothly without any hindrance.
At this time, Ch'ŏngbuk suffered a great famine, and the people were greatly dispersed. He set up a silver mine (銀店) and sent people to Kasan, Pakch'ŏn, etc., spreading the word that those who came to work would be paid generously. Hundreds of people gathered at once, so he gathered them all, dressed them in military uniforms, gave them weapons, and turned them into soldiers. Thus, the preparations were all complete.
It was the 19th day of the 12th lunar month of the Sinmi year (Western calendar 1811, 11th year of King Sunjo of Chosŏn). The banner of revolution flew in Tabok-tong. Hong Kyŏngnae, wearing a white gold helmet and red gold armor, holding a long sword slanted, stood high on the general's platform and commanded the entire army. Oh, how magnificent! Hong Kyŏngnae proclaimed himself Grand Marshal (大元帥), holding a banner inscribed "P'yŏngsŏ Grand Marshal Command" (平西大元帥司令). He appointed Kim Sayong as Vice Marshal (副元帥), U Kunch'ŭk and Kim Ch'angsi as Strategists (謀士), Hong Ch'onggak as Vanguard Commander (先鋒將), and Yi Chech'o as Rear Guard Commander (後軍將). The military discipline in marching and retreating was orderly, and their imposing spirit, soaring to the heavens, seemed poised to conquer the entire eight provinces of the peninsula at once. <57>
A proclamation was sent out to famous places throughout the country; the full text is as follows:
"Grand Marshal of P'yŏngsŏ, regarding the matter of issuing an urgent proclamation. All elders and sons of Kwansŏ (P'yŏngan Province), whether of public or private status, listen closely to this proclamation. Kwansŏ is the ancient domain of Sage Kija (箕聖), the old haunt of Tangun, where ceremonial attire flourished and culture shone brightly. During the Imjin War, it already achieved the merit of restoring the nation twice, and again during the Chŏngmyo Invasion, it demonstrated utmost loyalty in military support. Figures like the scholar Tunoam and the talent Wŏlp'o were also produced from the scholars of the West (西士). Yet the court treats the scholars of the West no differently than dung, to the extent that even slaves of powerful families, upon seeing a person from the West, invariably call them 'P'yŏngan bumpkin' (平漢). How can those who are scholars of the West not feel wronged and oppressed? In times of emergency, the court relies on the strength of the Western scholars, and during the examination period, it depends on the writings of the Western scholars. For four hundred years, how have the people of the West wronged the court? Currently, with the young king on the throne, powerful villains grow rampant daily, like Kim Chojo and Pak Chonggyŏng, who steal and manipulate state authority. Heaven sends disasters; winter thunder rumbles, hardly a year passes without it. Because of this, great famines occur repeatedly, the starved fill the roads, the old and weak suffer miserably, the populace is utterly decimated, almost to the point of immediate extinction. How fortunate that a hidden sage of the world has descended in Sŏnch'ŏn, Ch'ŏngbuk, below Ilsan Wŏlpak Mountain, upon Kunwangp'o shore, Kaya-dong Hongŭi Island. Born divine, at age five, he followed a divine monk into China. Having matured, he lived in seclusion in the Kanggye four-county region for five years, commanding 100,000 iron cavalry, descendants of loyal subjects of the fallen Ming Dynasty. Thus, he holds the ambition to purify the capital, but considering Kwansŏ as the 'homeland of Feng and Pei' (豊沛故鄕 - i.e., the birthplace of the revolution), he cannot bear to trample it. He first lets the heroes of Kwansŏ raise troops to save the people. Wherever the banner of righteousness arrives, none fail to await revival. Thus, this proclamation is issued first. Governors of various districts and counties, do not cause disturbance; open wide your city gates to welcome our commander. If there are any foolishly resisting stubbornly, we shall crush them without remainder with five thousand iron cavalry. You should quickly request orders and proceed accordingly. This proclamation is issued to: the Military Commander (兵使), Adjutant (虞侯), and Magistrate (牧使) of Anju; the County Magistrate (縣令) of Sukch'ŏn; the Governor (監司), Central Army Commander (中軍), and Vice-Magistrate (庶尹) of P'yŏngyang; the County Magistrate (縣令) of Kangso; the County Magistrate (縣令) of Yonggang; the Prefect (府使) of Samhwa; the Prefect (府使) of Hamjong; the County Magistrate (縣令) of Chŭngsan; the County Magistrate (縣令) of Yŏngyu."

IV. Eight Counties of Ch'ŏngbuk Occupied in an Instant
Like a swift wind and sudden thunder, the revolutionary army attacked the Kasan county office during the night of the 19th. They cut down the stubbornly resisting County Magistrate Chŏng Si and his son, and appointed Yun Wŏnsŏp as magistrate to guard it. A detachment of the revolutionary army, including Kim Ch'angsi, Yi Chech'o, and Kim Sayong, rushed north to Kwaksan, drove out County Magistrate Yi Yŏngsik, and appointed Pak Sŏngsin as magistrate to guard it. Kim Ch'angsi rushed to T'aech'ŏn, drove out County Magistrate Yu Chŏngyang, and appointed Pyŏn Taeik as magistrate to guard it. Hong Kyŏngnae's army arrived in Pakch'ŏn the next day, captured and imprisoned County Magistrate Im Sŏnggo, and appointed Han Irhwan as magistrate to guard it. They entered Chŏngju, drove out Magistrate Yi Kŭnch'ang, and appointed Ch'oe Ir'yun as magistrate to guard it. Kim Sayong's army rushed to Sŏnch'ŏn, received the surrender of Prefect Kim Iksun, and appointed Kim Ponggwan as magistrate to guard it. They attacked Ch'ŏlsan, received the surrender of Prefect Yi Changgyŏm, and appointed Chŏng Chŏil as magistrate to guard it. In this manner, the revolutionary army, with the force of splitting bamboo (破竹之勢), occupied the important eight counties of Ch'ŏngbuk without hindrance and intended to push straight down through Anju towards the capital.
When the army reached the banks of the Ch'ŏngch'ŏn River, the ice on the river had thawed, making it impossible to cross directly. While they hesitated, the Anju military commander Yi Haeu, having learned of the revolutionary army's military secrets beforehand, had strictly tightened security and was waiting with his neck craned. Thus, crossing casually became even more impossible. No matter if Yi Haeu blocked the path ahead, he was merely an ordinary man. Had they pushed forward with their victorious momentum, crushed Anju Castle, and conquered both Western provinces (兩西 - P'yŏngan and Hwanghae) at once... Alas! The thawing of the Ch'ŏngch'ŏn River, which made the hero's swift courage hesitate, is truly a matter of eternal regret (千古之恨事)! Having no choice, they retreated and formed ranks in Songnim, Pakch'ŏn territory. This place was 10 *ri* from Anju, allowing the troops to rest briefly.
When the alarm reached the court, the Border Defense Council (備邊司) first selected renowned military officers as governors and dispatched them to each county. They appointed Yi Yohon as Commander-in-Chief for the Two Western Provinces (兩西巡撫), made Pak Kit'ae Central Army Commander (中軍), and had him lead the generals out to battle. <58> About 700 government soldiers, led by Central Army Commander Pak Kit'ae, departed from the capital on the 27th of the 12th month and headed for Anju.

V. Unfavorable Situation! Siege of Chŏngju Castle
While the revolutionary army stayed in Songnim for several days preparing to cross the river, the government army crossed the river first. On the 27th of the 12th month, the government and revolutionary armies clashed. Initially, there was one victory and one defeat, but ultimately, the revolutionary army was forced to retreat. Hong Kyŏngnae, assessing the unfavorable situation himself, thought, "Let's retreat briefly, gather more strength, wait for reinforcements, and then fight the enemy once more." After consulting with his generals, he gathered the remaining troops and entered Chŏngju Castle.
As the revolutionary army entered Chŏngju Castle and strengthened its defenses, U Kunch'ŭk guarded the North Command Post (北將臺), Yi Haeyu guarded the South Gate (南門), Ch'a Yongsu guarded the East Gate (東門), Kim Chich'ŏn guarded the North Gate (北門), and Hŏ Kyŏng guarded the West Gate (西門). Hong Kyŏngnae became the Central Army Commander-in-Chief (中軍 大將), Kim Chin'gak became the Vice Commander (副將), Paek Chonghoe became the Supply Officer (運粮官), and Hong Ch'onggak led 500 strong young men (壯丁軍) in daily training. They decided to wait for the return of Vice Marshal Kim Sayong before taking further action. After some time, government troops gradually gathered outside Chŏngju Castle. Along the T'aech'ŏn River (㺚川江 - likely a mistake for Ch'ŏngch'ŏn River or nearby stream, as T'aech'ŏn is a county name), the government and revolutionary armies faced each other, preparing for a final decisive battle.

VI. Alas! The Last Stand of the Revolutionary Army
The revolutionary army fought fiercely in isolation for several months, defeating the government forces multiple times, and almost gained the momentum for a comeback (捲土重來). Alas! Was it the unfavorable turn of fate? Righteous militias (義兵) rose up in various places, aiding the government forces. Moreover, the revolutionary army grew increasingly exhausted from numerous battles, losing the various towns they had initially captured back to the government forces, ultimately reduced to desperately defending the single castle of Chŏngju.
April 18th, Imsin year - exactly four months since the cry of revolution was raised in Tabok-tong. On this day, the government forces dug deep tunnels under the northern wall of Chŏngju Castle, planted gunpowder there, and lit the fuses to detonate it. With a thunderous roar (霹靂 一聲), the castle battlements collapsed. The soldiers inside the castle were greatly alarmed by the unexpected event and lost their composure. The government forces launched an all-out assault, pouring into the castle, and the castle finally fell. Alas, the revolutionary army, whose ranks had become more organized and whose military spirit had grown stronger during the 3-4 months of protracted warfare, hoping for a comeback, met a heroic and tragic end in this final battle, losing the strength to rise again. Even in this situation, the revolutionary army did not yield in the slightest, engaging the government forces in a massive bloody battle. Ultimately, thousands of revolutionary officers and soldiers were either killed in action or captured alive, and the curtain fell on this tragic climax. Amidst this chaos, our revolutionary leader, Grand Marshal Hong Kyŏngnae of P'yŏngsŏ, vanished like a shadow... ? ? ? The Sinmi Revolution ended thus. How could later generations withhold a handful of tears? <59>

**Summary**

This article, part one of two, recounts the 1811 Hong Kyŏngnae Rebellion, termed the "Sinmi Revolution," focusing on the figure of Hong Kyŏngnae. Written by Yi Yunjae in 1931, it portrays Hong as a heroic figure motivated by righteous indignation against the corrupt Yi Dynasty court, regional discrimination against Northwesterners (Sŏbuk), and the suffering of the common people. The narrative details Hong's background, the motivations and preparations for the uprising, the initial rapid success in capturing eight towns in Ch'ŏngbuk (Northern P'yŏngan Province), the setback at the Ch'ŏngch'ŏn River, the eventual siege of Chŏngju Castle, and the tragic, heroic defeat of the rebels after a four-month struggle. The author laments the failure of the revolution but celebrates the spirit of Hong Kyŏngnae.

From the perspective of Korean colonial history, this article is significant. Written during Japanese rule, Yi Yunjae's laudatory portrayal of Hong Kyŏngnae and his rebellion against perceived injustice and corruption implicitly critiques the contemporary colonial situation. By framing the 1811 rebellion as a "revolution" (革命) led by a national hero fighting for the oppressed, the author invokes a historical precedent for resistance and national pride, likely intended to resonate with Koreans under Japanese occupation. The emphasis on regional discrimination (against Northwesterners) by the central government also mirrors potential sentiments about colonial discrimination. Historians might find the article's nationalistic tone, its specific framing of the rebellion, and its publication context valuable for understanding Korean intellectual responses and nationalist sentiment during the colonial period.

辛未革命과 辛未洋亂
						李允宰
辛未! 단군 이후로 辛未의 해를 겪은 수가 70회나 되리니 그 동안에 辛未에서 생긴 역사상 중요한 대사건을 들려면 무던히 많을 것이다. 그러나 너무 오래된 사실을랑 그만 제치어 놓고 近世史상에 나타난 곳 요전번 辛未, 전전번 辛未에서 일어난 사건만 들기로 하자. 이 두 辛未의 사건이야말로 한 趣味의 好對照가 된다. 하나는 洪景來를 중심으로 한 內亂이요 한나는 崔蘭軒을 중심으로 한 外寇다. 어느 것이나 다 壯快하고 활약한 역사의 한 페지를 꾸미기에 넉넉하다. 먼저 辛未革命부터 말하리라.

辛未革命
一. 洪景來는 어떠한 인물인가.
4백여 년 엉기엇든 義血을 한번 뿜어내어 3천리에 잠기엇든 汚塵을 한번 쓸어버리려고 『으아』 소리를 웨치어 半島의 적막을 께트리고 일어선 寧馨兒 平西 大元帥 洪景來는 어떠한 사람이든가.
지금으로부터 147년전 甲辰(西歷 1784년, 朝鮮 正祖 8년)에 平安道 龍岡郡 多美面 瑞洞 한구석에서 우리 영웅 洪장군의 呱呱의 소리가 들어낫다. 나매 골격이 비범하고 지기가 高邁하며 勇猛이 絶倫하고 재능이 구비하여 영웅의 자질을 갖추엇다. 어려서 글방에 가서 通鑑이란 책을 배우다가 『陳勝輟耕嘆曰, 壯士不死則己, 死則擧大名』이란 구절에 이르러 주먹을 불끈 쥐며 『남자의 뜻이 맞당히 이러하여야 한다』하며 탄복하는 것을 그 선생이 보고 『아아 장차 큰일 낼 놈이로구나』하고 속으로 점을 처두엇다. 하로는 또 글방에서 선생이 담배대를 물고 마루 끝에 서서 담배불을 붙이매 景來가 뒤로 살그머니 가서 밀치어 버리엇다. 선생이 크게 놀래어 꾸짖으니 태연히 대답하되 『긔회가 좋기로 그리하엿소』 하엿다. 또 낮이면 동무들과 같이 글방에서 글을 읽고 밤이면 홀로 산에 올라가 釰術을 배우고 陣法을 익히엇다. 얼마 뒤에 선생에게 눈치가 들렷다. 거기 오래 류하는 것이 재미없을 줄 알고 그 익일에 『乾坤有意生男子, 筆硯無心老丈夫』란 詩 한수를 지어서 글방＜56＞ 벽우에다 붙이어 두고 어대로인지 자취를 감추어 버리고 말앗다. 또 소년 때에 서울에 과거 보러 갓다가 급제하지 못하엿드니 하로는 임금의 거동하는 것을 구경하고 『과거에 급제하는 것보다 임금 되는 것이 좋다』하엿다. 이것이 몇 개 일화에 지나지 아니하나 洪景來의 인물됨이 얼마나 걸걸하고 호방한가를 알아볼 수 잇는 것이다.

二. 革命의 動機와 革命運動
이씨 朝鮮 5백년간 소위 나라의 꼴악신이란 어떠하엿나. 壬辰의 국난과 丙子의 國辱같은 치명적 傷痛을 받앗건마는 오히려 文恬 武嬉로써 昇平을 자랑하며 세계 역사에 유례가 없는 士禍와 黨論이 3백년간 大慘劇을 연출하엿으며 또 조정에서 用人함이 극히 편벽되어 西北 人士를 천대하기가 막심하여 文不過持平掌令 武不過守門副將이라는 지경까지 이르럿으며 더욱이 近者에 이르러는 외척이 弄權하고 賄賂가 公行하여 國政이 문란하며 또 連年 歉凶이 荐至하매 民情이 嗷嗷하여 돌아갈 바를 알지 못하엿다. 이때 이를 한번 掃淸할 一個 義氣 男兒가 없단 말이냐. 三尺釰을 짚고 일어나 조정의 奸黨을 제거하고 도탄에 든 백성을 건지리라는 자유 평등 주의를 절규하고 소매를 떨치고 문을 나선 이가 洪景來엿다.
洪景來가 이와 같이 남달리 큰 뜻을 품고 우선 淸北列邑을 다니면서 많은 사람이 사귀어 비밀리에 많은 동지를 규합하엿다. 嘉山에 禹君則, 李希著와 郭山에 洪總角, 金昌始와 价川에 李濟初와 黃州에 金士容 등 허다한 영웅을 만낫다. 平安, 黃海, 양도로 다니며 道術로서 富豪를 연락하여 경제의 여유를 얻고 또 일변으로 平壞의 일등 名妓 수십명을 사와서 큰 배 여러 척에 기녀와 풍악을 실고 대도시와 浦口마다 찾아 다니면서 놀이를 베설하여 수만명 관객 중에 함께 나센 壯士를 골라 가지고 더리고 와서 주식으로 대접하고 金帛을 나누어 주며 좋은 말로 달래어 부하를 삼앗다. 이러구러 모인 것이 수개월간에 천여 명의 壯士를 얻게 되엇다.

三. 으아! 革命이야
洪景來가 嘉山邑에서 東으로 10里되는 多福洞을 근거를 정하고 부하에게 陣法을 연습하며 軍器를 제조하여 그 큰 계획이 아무 거리낌 없이 순조로 진행되엇다.
이때 淸北에 雇는 큰 흉년이 들어 人民이 크게 離散하엿다. 銀店을 차려 놓고 嘉山, 博川 등지에 사람을 보내어 와서 일하는 자는 價를 후히 준다고 전파하니 일시에 모여 드는자 수백명에 달하므로 다 불러모아 군복을 입히고 軍器룰 주어 군사를 만들엇다. 이렇게 준비는 다 완성된 것이다.
辛未年(西歷 1811년, 朝鮮 純祖 11년) 12월 19일이엇다. 多福洞에 혁명의 旗빨이 날리엇다. 洪景來는 白金 투구에 紅金 갑옷을 입고 長劒을 빗겨 들고 將壇에 높이 서서 一軍을 호령하엿다. 어허 壯快하다! 洪景來는 스스로 大元帥가 되어 『平西大元帥司令』이라 쓴 手旗를 잡앗고 金士容을 副元帥로, 禹君則
金昌始를 謀士로, 洪總角을 先鋒將으로, 李濟初를 後軍將으로 하엿다. 行軍 進退에 軍容이 정연하여 그 늠름한 衝天의 기세는 단박에 팔도강산을 석권할 듯＜57＞ 싶엇다.
전국 명처에 檄文을 날리니 전문은 이러하다.
『平西大元帥, 爲急急致檄事. 我關西父老子弟公私之賤, 咸聽此檄. 盖關西, 箕聖古域. 檀君舊窟, 衣冠岌濟, 文物炳悢. 粵在壬辰之亂, 己有再造之功, 又於丁卯之變, 克輸襄武之忠. 有如遯菴之學, 月浦之才, 又是産於西士, 而朝延之等棄西士, 不異糞士, 甚至於權門奴婢見西士之人, 則必曰平漢, 其爲西士者, 豈不寃抑哉. 若當緩急, 則必賴西士之力, 且當科時則必籍西士之文, 四百年來, 西人, 有何負於朝延哉. 見今冲王在上, 權奸日熾, 如金祖淳朴宗慶輩, 竊弄國柄, 仁天降灾, 冬雷也震, 殆無虛歲, 由此大無荐臻, 餓殍載道, 老弱塗炭, 生民盡劉, 幾乎在卽, 何幸潛世之聖人, 誕降于淸北宣川釰山日月峉下君王浦上伽倻洞紅衣島, 生而神靈, 五歲, 隨神僧入中國, 旣長, 隱居于江界四郡地閭延五載, 統領皇明之世臣遺孫, 鐵騎十萬, 遂有澄淸京國之志, 而維此關西, 卽豊沛故鄕, 不忍蹙踏, 先使關西之豪傑輩, 起兵救民, 義旗所到, 莫不徯蘇. 茲以檄文先諭, 列府郡侯, 切勿擾動, 洞開城門, 以迎我帥. 若有蠢爾頑拒者, 當以鐵驕五千, 蹙之無遺矣, 宜速請命擧行宜當者. 右檄, 下安州兵使虞侯牧使, 肅川縣令, 平壤監司中軍庶尹, 江西縣令, 龍岡縣令, 三和府使, 咸從府使, 甑山縣令, 永柔縣令.』

四. 淸北 八邑을 瞬間에 占領
혁명군이 疾風迅雷 같이 19일 밤 중에 바루 嘉山郡衙를 덥치엇다. 완강히 항거하는 郡守 鄭蓍의 부자를 베어 죽이고 尹元涉으로 군수를 삼아 직히게 하엿다. 혁명군의 一枝隊인 金昌始, 李濟初, 金士容 등은 북으로 郭山을 달려가 군수 李永植을 쫓고 朴星臣으로 군수를 삼아 직히게 하며 金昌始는 泰川을 달려가 縣監 柳鼎養을 쫓고 邊大益으로 縣監을 삼아 직히게 하엿다. 洪景來 軍은 그 翌日에 博川에 이르러 군수 任聖皐를 잡아 가두고 韓日煥으로 군수를 삼아 직히게 하며 定州로 들어가 牧使 李近昌를 쫓고 崔爾崙으로 牧使를 삼아 직히게 하엿다. 또 金士容 軍은 宣川을 달려가 府使 金益淳을 항복받고 金奉觀으로 府使를 삼아 직히게 하며 鐵山을 처서 府使 李章謙을 항복 받고 鄭祚一로 府使를 삼아 직히게 하엿다. 이와 같이 혁명군은 破竹의 勢로 淸北의 중요한 8邑을 거침없이 점령하고 安州를 거치어 단박에 경성을 내리밀려 하엿다.
군사가 淸川江岸에 다달으니 江에 얼음이 풀리어 그냥 건늘 수가 없게 되엇다. 어마어마하는 동안에 安州 병사 李海愚가 혁명군의 軍機를 미리 알고 단속을 엄히 하여 목을 받고 잇으므로 더욱 만만히 건너갈 수가 없게 되엇다. 아무리 李海愚가 앞길을 막는다기론 제 한낫 凡夫에 지나지 않을지니 승승장구의 기세로 한번 몰아가 안주성을 뭇질르고 일시에 兩西를 석권하엿을 것을 ... 아아! 영웅의 勇快가 걸음을 주저하게 한 淸川江의 해빙은 진실로 千古의 恨事로다. 할 수 없이 물러와 博川땅 松林에 結陣하니 여기는 安州서 10里 相距라 적이 군사를 쉬게 하엿다.
警報가 조정에 이르매 備邊司에서 먼저 名武로 수령을 擇定하여 각 읍으로 派送하며 李堯憲으로 兩西巡撫를 拜하고 朴基豊으로 中軍을 삼아 諸將을 거느리고 出征하게 하엿다.＜58＞ 官軍 7백여 명은 中軍 朴基豊의 引領으로 12월 27일로서 京城을 출발하여 安州로 향하엿다.

五. 時勢不利! 定州籠城
혁명군이 이미 여러 날로 송림에 머물러 잇어 강을 거늘 준비를 하는 때에 官軍이 먼저 강을 건너왓다. 12월 27일에 官革 兩軍이이 交火하여 처음에 일승 일패가 잇엇으나 마지막에는 혁명군이 퇴각하는 부득이함에 이르럿다. 洪景來는 형세의 불리함을 스스로 살피고 생각하기를 잠간 물러가 잇어 더 힘을 기르고 구원병을 기다려서 한번 다시 적으로 더불어 싸우리라 하고 諸將을 불러 의논한 후 남은 군사를 거두어 거느리고 定州城으로 들어갓다.
혁명군이 定州城으로 들어가서 방비를 엄히할 새 禹君則은 北將臺를 직히고 李海裕는 南門을 직히고 車用守는 東門을 직히고 金之千은 北門을 직히고 許敬은 西門을 직히게 하며 洪景來는 中軍 大將이 되고 金鎭珏은 副將이 되고 白宗會는 運粮官이 되고 洪總角은 壯丁軍 5백명을 거느리고 날마다 조련하게 하엿다. 그러고 副元帥 金士容이 돌아오기를 기다려 거사하기로 작정하엿다. 얼마 뒤에 官軍이 定州城 밖으로 점차 모이어 왓다. 㺚川江을 끼고 官革 兩軍이 對陣하여 최후 一戰으로써 決하려 하엿다.

六. 鳴呼! 革命軍의 最後
혁명군은 수개월로 고전 악투하여 官軍을 여러번 破하고 장차 捲土重來의 형새를 얻을 번 하드니 아아! 時運의 불리함인가 각 처에서 의병이 일어나 관군의 세력을 돕고 또 혁명군은 여러번 싸움에 점점 피폐하여저서 처음에 점령하엿든 여러 고을을 다 관군의 손에 돌려 보내고 다만 定州 한 성을 死守함에 그치엇다.
壬申 4월 18일 - 多福洞에서 혁명의 소리를 웨친 지 만 4개월이다. 이 날에 관군이 定州 北城下에 깊이 땅을 파고 거기에 화약을 묻고 도화선에 불을 붙이어 폭발하게 하니 霹靂 一聲에 城堞이 무너지고 城中에 군사들은 의외의 일에 크게 驚惶하여 정신을 못차리게 되엇다. 관군이 일제히 돌격을 개시하여 城中으로 처들어가니 성이 그만 함락되엇다. 아아, 3, 4개월의 지구전에 隊伍가 더욱 정돈되고 軍容이 갈스록 振興하여 捲土重來를 긔약하든 혁명군은 壯絶 慘絶한 최후의 일전으로써 다시 더 일어날 힘이 없게 되엇다. 혁명군은 비록 이런 중이지마는 조금도 굽히지 아니하고 관군과 닥드려 대혈전을 演하여 필경 혁명군의 將卒은 戰死와 生擒된 자 수천을 내고 이 비극의 클라이막쓰의 막이 닫히엇다. 이 북새틈에 우리 혁명대장 平西大元帥 洪景來는 그림자가 살아지고 말앗다. ... ? ? ? 辛未혁명은 그만 이러하고 말앗다. 후세 사람으로 하여금 어찌 一掬의 눈물을 아끼랴.＜59＞
