Article Title: 氣熖萬丈 드면錄, 蔣介石이 되엿드면 (Record of Soaring Aspirations: If I Were Chiang Kai-shek)
Author: 東亞日報社長 宋鎭禹 (Tong-A Ilbo President, Song Chin-u)
Article Type: 설문 (Survey/Interview)

Reporter: "Sir, if you were born in China (中國) and were in the same position of triumph as Chiang Kai-shek (蔣介石) is today..."

Mr. Song Chin-u (宋鎭禹): "Internally cultivating the people's strength (民力) and externally concentrating the people's spirit (民氣) to aim for the complete recovery (回收) of national sovereignty (국권) would be the urgent task (急務) at present (目下).<15>

**Summary**

This short interview excerpt features Song Chin-u, the president of the Tong-A Ilbo newspaper, responding to a hypothetical question: what would he do if he were in Chiang Kai-shek's position in China? Song states his priority would be to cultivate the people's strength internally and consolidate their spirit externally, aiming for the complete recovery of national sovereignty. This response reflects the strong nationalist aspirations prevalent among Korean intellectuals during the colonial period, projecting onto China's situation the desire for national self-strengthening and independence that was suppressed in Korea itself. Historians might find it interesting as an example of how Korean elites viewed contemporary Chinese politics as a potential model or parallel for their own national goals, particularly regarding sovereignty and mobilization of the populace.
