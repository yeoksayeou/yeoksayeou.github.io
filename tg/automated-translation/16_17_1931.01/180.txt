Article Title: 氣熖萬丈 『드면錄』, 만일 내가 張學良이엇드면 (Record of 'If I Were...', With Spirits High as the Heavens: If I Were Chang Hsüeh-liang)
Author: 平壤 金東元 (P'yŏngyang Kim Tong-wŏn)
Article Type: 설문 (Survey/Questionnaire)

Reporter: "If you, sir, were in the current enviable position of Chang Hsüeh-liang, what would you do?"

Mr. Kim Tong-wŏn: "Without needing to say it twice, I would absolutely cooperate with the Nanjing government to complete unification, and make Manchuria (滿洲) prosper and develop as completely Chinese territory, both politically and culturally."

**Summary**

This article presents a hypothetical question posed to Kim Tong-wŏn of P'yŏngyang: what he would do if he were the powerful Chinese warlord Chang Hsüeh-liang. Kim responds that he would cooperate fully with the Nanjing government to unify China and ensure Manchuria develops as an integral part of China, politically and culturally. From the perspective of Korean colonial history, this piece is interesting as it shows a Korean intellectual expressing a clear opinion on contemporary Chinese politics and the sensitive issue of Manchuria's status, advocating for Chinese unification and sovereignty over the region during a period of increasing Japanese encroachment. Historians might find it valuable as evidence of Korean engagement with and perspectives on regional geopolitical issues, particularly concerning China's internal struggles and the future of Manchuria, a region with significant Korean populations and historical ties.
