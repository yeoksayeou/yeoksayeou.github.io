The Road Returning from a Visit
						Cho Un
(Written in the car on the way back from visiting a friend who, after being inside for 3 years, came out due to serious illness and is lying lonely in a small rented room. 30. 11. 1)

Day and night we used to sit facing each other, our talk never-ending.
Three years felt like ten, there must have been so much to say.
Facing him, both words and tears were choked back, just looking blankly.

I had meant to at least fix the window paper before leaving.
The night wind after the rain has cleared is terribly cold, so cold.
The mosquito net comes to mind, how could I leave, how could I?

Unable to bear a proper farewell, I said I’d drop by again when leaving.
Ah, what a thoughtless thing to do! This weighs on my mind now.
The cold moon has tilted low, is he still awake?

When I return home, what shall I tell them?
Like chewed leftovers, cast out sick,
But I shall say, "That illness couldn't carve his spirit, don't worry."<39>

**Summary**

This poem describes the poet's visit to a friend recently released from imprisonment ("entered" for 3 years) due to severe illness. The friend is now living alone in poverty and poor health. The poet feels immense sorrow and guilt, struggling to communicate during the visit and haunted by the friend's condition afterward, particularly the inadequate farewell. The poem concludes with the poet resolving to tell people back home not to worry, masking the grim reality of the friend's situation. For historians, the poem offers a glimpse into the harsh conditions potentially faced by released prisoners (possibly political, given the context of the era and Cho Un's associations) in colonial Korea, highlighting themes of illness, poverty, social isolation, and the emotional burden carried by friends and family. The stark metaphor "chewed leftovers, cast out sick" poignantly captures a sense of societal abandonment.

도라다 뵈는 길
						曺雲
들어간 지 3년만에 중병으로 나와 적은 방 한간을 세어더 외로이 누어잇는 벗을 차자가 보고 도라오는 길에 차 안에서 30. 11. 1

밤낮 마조앉아 이 아기끝이 없엇것다
3년이 10년만 하야 할 말이 조ㅁ많아리
대하니 말도 눈물도 막혀 물그럼히 보기만

창이나 발라주고 떠나오자 하든 것이
비 개인 밤바람은 몹시도 차고 차다
蚊布가 눈에 밟히네 어이 갈ㅅ고 어이가

작별을 참아 못마춰 떠날 때 다녀가마 햇네
에기 못할 짓을! 이게 맘에 걸리네나
찬 달이 기우럿는데 상기깨어 잇는가

고향에 도라가면 무어이라 이르를ㅅ고
깨물고 남은 찌겅이 병안구어 내쳣는데
그 병도 맘은 못 색이드구 걱정마소 하리라＜39＞
＜39＞
