Full of Spirit, 'If Only I Were' Record: What If I Were a Newspaper Reporter?
						Kaebyŏk Company, Ch'a Sangch'an

Reporter: "If you were to manage a newspaper, sir, how would you do it?"

Mr. Ch'a Sangch'an: "I don't really know about management, but if I were a newspaper reporter, I would disregard all personal feelings (情實) or circumstances (사정) and write only the fair facts just as they are."<22>

**Summary**

This brief interview excerpt features Ch'a Sangch'an from the Kaebyŏk Company discussing his hypothetical approach if he were a newspaper reporter. He emphasizes his commitment to objectivity, stating he would ignore personal feelings or mitigating circumstances and report only the impartial facts. From a colonial history perspective, this highlights the journalistic ideal of objectivity being discussed or aspired to, even under the constraints of the era. Ch'a's specific mention of disregarding "情實" (personal connections/feelings) and "사정" (circumstances) might suggest these were seen as potential corrupting influences on reporting at the time.
