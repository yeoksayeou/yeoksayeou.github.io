Full of Spirit, 'If I were...' Record
						Yi Tae-wi, Secretary of the Youth Association Federation

If I were a Large Landowner

Reporter: "If you were a large landowner, what enterprise would you undertake?"

Mr. Yi Tae-wi: "I would dedicate my entire fortune and exert all my efforts towards the cooperative movement, particularly focusing on fostering leaders and supplying materials to central cooperative institutions."

If I Became a Student Again...
Kim Hang-bok, Principal of Sungin Commercial School

Reporter: "Principal, if you became a student again, what would be your wish?"

Mr. Kim Hang-bok: "Of course, I would be diligent in my studies, but beyond that, I would read many books to broaden my general knowledge, and also practice at least one type of sport to try and become an athlete. It is a great regret that I couldn't exercise during my student days, leading to my weak constitution."<82>

**Summary**

This brief article presents responses from two prominent Korean figures in 1931 to hypothetical questions. Yi Tae-wi, a youth leader, states that if he were a wealthy landowner, he would invest everything in the cooperative movement, emphasizing leadership training and resource supply. Kim Hang-bok, a school principal, reflects that if he were a student again, he would focus on broad reading and athletics, regretting his lack of exercise during his own youth which he blames for his poor health. For historians, the article offers insights into the aspirations of the Korean elite during the colonial period: Yi's focus on cooperative movements hints at strategies for economic self-reliance and community organization, while Kim's emphasis on both intellectual breadth and physical fitness reflects contemporary concerns with modernization and national well-being under Japanese rule.
