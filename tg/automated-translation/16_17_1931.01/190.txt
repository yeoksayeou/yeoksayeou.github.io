Spirited Record of 'Ifs', If I Were a Man
						General Secretary Kim Sŏngsil of the Women's Christian Youth Association Federation

Reporter: "If you were a man, what would you do?"

Ms. Kim Sŏngsil: "I haven't thought about such a thing. I am satisfied with being a woman."

Reporter: "No, I mean, supposing hypothetically that you were."

Ms. Kim Sŏngsil: "I would abstain from alcohol, abstain from sexual indulgence, and abstain from smoking."<65>

**Summary**

This short interview features Kim Sŏngsil, the General Secretary of the Women's Christian Youth Association Federation (likely the YWCA Federation). When asked what she would do if she were a man, she initially expresses contentment with being a woman. Pressed further, she states she would practice abstinence from alcohol, sex, and smoking. From a historical perspective, this brief exchange reflects the influence of Christian-linked social reform movements prevalent in colonial Korea, which often emphasized temperance and moral uprightness. It highlights the views of an educated, socially active woman of the era regarding perceived male vices and connects personal morality with public roles.
