1
Who could have known
That the flower of laughter for a moment would become the tears of another?
Even the departed lord likely does not know.
Now, wandering alone, I weep by the old fortress ruins.

2
The green grass blades from when the fortress was built—are they green once more now?
For five hundred long years, they have bloomed and bloomed again,
But why does the lord who departed in a single step not know the way back?

3
That old woman planting potatoes on the crumbling fortress site—
Even as you plant your potatoes, please don’t find fault with me.
...How can I not let out a sigh?
Spring 1930, Sŏngbuk-tong <30>

**Summary**

This poem by Cho Chonghyŏn, titled "Spring Sentiments in Sŏngbuk," reflects on the passage of time and loss, using the ruins of an old fortress (likely referring to the Seoul City Wall near Sŏngbuk-tong) as a backdrop. The speaker laments the contrast between fleeting joy ("flower of laughter") and enduring sorrow ("tears"), personifies the departed ruler ("님") who seems unaware of the present state, contrasts the cyclical resilience of nature (grass) with the finality of human departure, and observes the mundane present (an old woman planting potatoes) intruding on the historical site. The poem ends with a sense of resigned sorrow. For historians, the poem offers a glimpse into the melancholy and sense of loss felt by intellectuals during the Japanese colonial period, likely mourning the fallen Chosŏn Dynasty (implied by "five hundred years") and the loss of sovereignty, juxtaposed against the unchanging natural world and the struggle for daily existence.

城北春懷
						趙宗玄
1
한때의 우슴꽃이 또 한때의 눈물일 줄
어느 뉘 알앗으리 가신 님도 모르실 걸
이지음 내 홀로 가며 옛 城터에 웁네다.

2
城쌀 때 푸른 풀잎 이제다시 또 푸럿나
오백년 긴긴해를 피고피고 또 폇다만
단 걸음 가읍신 님은 어이 올 줄 모른가.

3
헐어진 城지 위에 감자심는 저 할머니
감잘탕 심으세도 내 흉일랑 보지 맙소.
... 한숨 아니 지리까.
