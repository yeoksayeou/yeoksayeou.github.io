Overseas Cartoons

A handshake with one hand, a deadly weapon (凶器) in the other – Is this the true meaning of German-French friendship (獨佛兩國交驩)? <18>

Britain (英國), having suspended the Gold Standard (金本位), says to the United States (美國), "Get rid of that troublesome tail quickly." <21>

The British Empire suffering because of the 'Pound' (磅) currency – The 'Pound', once the king of finance in former days (昔日), has today become the cross of suffering for the British people. <39>

Unemployment Relief Plan (失業救濟案) <54>

Sermon by a Villain – Capone (카폰), the big boss of Chicago's (시카고) villains (惡黨). <56>

**Summary**

This article consists of captions for five international political and social cartoons published in the January 1932 issue of *Tonggwang* magazine. The cartoons comment on contemporary global issues: the underlying tension in Franco-German relations despite outward signs of amity, Britain's departure from the gold standard and its economic consequences, the burden of the depreciated Pound Sterling on the British Empire, unemployment relief measures (likely related to the Great Depression), and the notoriety of American organized crime figure Al Capone in Chicago. From a historical perspective, the selection reveals that Korean magazines during the colonial period engaged with major international events, providing readers with insights into global politics and economics beyond the immediate concerns of Korea or the Japanese Empire. It highlights an awareness of the complex international situation, including the fragility of European peace, the global economic crisis, and social issues in the West.
