1. How much tax do we pay?
2. Is our burden heavy or light?
3. Are taxes increasing or decreasing?
Discussion of Various Problems Closely Related to Real Life

1. Foreword
Just as an individual's livelihood requires considerable money, the management of a national government also requires corresponding funds. Individuals seek their living funds based on property and occupation, and if these two are insufficient or non-existent, they may rely on debt. Like individuals, the national government not only derives income from state-owned official properties and government-run institutions but also secures income through taxes, which is impossible for individuals. Therefore, tax is a unique source of income for the national government. It is unique financially and unique in the relationship between the national government and the people. In other words, among the national government's income, that is, revenue, taxes are economically and politically significant. Why is this so? Because taxes are monetary burdens forcibly imposed by the national government using its authority on people and things within the country to cover the public expenses of the entire nation. Therefore, the tax burden of a nation's people has a tremendous relationship with the people's own lives. Here, let us discuss the taxes of Korea (朝鮮), which have such a tremendous relationship with our lives. Of course, the scope of discussion for taxes is vast, so according to the request of the Tonggwang editors, I intend to specifically discuss the types and amounts of taxes, examine the trend of Korean taxation, and point out the burden on Koreans.

2. Taxes and Their Trends
Examining the Korean tax system, it is divided into (1) National Taxes, (2) Provincial Taxes, (3) Prefectural Taxes (府稅), and (4) Myŏn Levies (面賦課金).

(1) National Taxes and Their Trend

So, what do National Taxes refer to? They are taxes paid to the central government, including (1) Land Tax (地稅), (2) Income Tax (所得稅), (3) Business Tax (營業稅), (4) Capital Interest Tax (資本利子稅), (5) Exchange Tax (取引所稅), (6) Transaction Tax (取引稅), (7) Mining Tax (鑛稅), (8) Liquor Tax (酒稅), (9) Sugar Consumption Tax (砂糖消費稅), (10) Stamp Tax (印紙稅), (11) Registration Tax (登錄稅), and (12) Bank of Chosŏn Note Issue Tax (朝鮮銀行券發行稅). Let's discuss the trend based on these national tax <35> items.

(a) Land Tax

Land Tax occupies the most important position in the Korean tax system. It is important economically and politically. Economically speaking, in Taishō 7 (1918), the tax amount was merely 11,220,851 wŏn, but by Shōwa 4 (1929), it jumped to 15,665,074 wŏn, occupying the top spot among Korean tax amounts. In terms of the number of taxpayers, it was 3,374,279 in Taishō 7, reaching 4,006,667 by Shōwa 4. Even excluding the 86,858 Japanese and 2,087 foreigners among the taxpayers in Shōwa 4, the number has increased more excessively than we expected. Furthermore, looking at the number of taxpayers by the amount paid, according to Shōwa 4 statistics, there were 364 Koreans paying 500 wŏn or more in taxes, whereas the number of Japanese was 525, decidedly more than the number of Koreans. Considering that over 80% of the Korean population are farmers, this cannot but be considered politically significant as well.

(b) Income Tax

Income Tax is said to be a relatively progressive tax system from the perspective of burden fairness. Examining its development process, it was merely 786,346 wŏn in Taishō 10 (1921), but increased to 1,301,460 wŏn by Shōwa 4 (1929), nearly doubling. The number of taxpayers also increased sixfold, from 295 in Taishō 10 to 1,304 in Shōwa 4.
In Korea, it is not an income tax on individual income but a tax on the ordinary income, excess income, and liquidation income of corporations. However, considering the inevitable development of the tax system, it seems likely that Income Tax will become promising in Korea in the future. Regarding such an important tax, I would like to examine Korea's ability to bear the burden or its future capacity, but it is regrettable that numerical analysis and inference cannot be made due to incomplete reference materials.

(c) Business Tax

Compared to Land Tax or Income Tax, Business Tax is a relatively new tax, established in Shōwa 2 (1927), reaching 97,000 wŏn in that year. As with Income Tax, there are no materials available for reference regarding the amount paid by ethnicity, so I will omit it here.

(d) Capital Interest Tax

Capital Interest Tax was also established in the same year as Business Tax. In Shōwa 2 (1927), it was 317,579 wŏn, reaching 337,705 wŏn by Shōwa 5 (1930).

(e) Mining Tax

Mining Tax differs in its trend ("tendency" - 텐덴씨) from the taxes discussed above. It was 626,914 wŏn in Taishō 7 (1918) but decreased to 544,849 wŏn by Shōwa 5 (1930). Compared to the 505,000 wŏn in Shōwa 2 (1927), however, it is said to be an increase.

(f) Other Taxes (Unit: Thousand Wŏn)
[Table showing tax amounts for Bank of Chosŏn Note Issue Tax, Exchange Tax, Tobacco Cultivation Tax, Liquor Tax, Transaction Tax, Sugar Consumption Tax, Stamp Tax, and Registration Tax for Taishō 7 (1918), Taishō 11 (1922), Shōwa 2 (1927), and Shōwa 5 (1930)]
According to the statistical figures above, the Bank of Chosŏn Note Issue Tax, Exchange Tax, and Tobacco Cultivation Tax have each decreased, while all others, starting with the Liquor Tax, have increased. Overall, considering the general trend of national taxes, it can be explained by the two characters: increase. <36>

(2) Provincial Taxes and Their Trend

The Provincial Tax items currently implemented in Korea are Land Tax Surtax, Income Tax Surtax, Household Tax (戶稅), House Tax (家屋稅), Special Market Tax, Slaughter Tax (屠畜稅) and Slaughterhouse Tax (屠場稅), Fishery Tax, Ship Tax, Vehicle Tax, and Real Estate Acquisition Tax. Examining the individual trends:
(Unit: Thousand Wŏn)
[Table showing tax amounts for Land Tax Surtax, Household Tax, House Tax, Slaughter Tax/Slaughterhouse Tax, Fishery Tax, Ship Tax, Vehicle Tax, Income Tax Surtax, Real Estate Acquisition Tax, Special Market Tax for Taishō 7 (1918), Taishō 11 (1922), Shōwa 2 (1927), and Shōwa 5 (1930)]
According to the figures above, except for the Ship Tax, the increase over the past 12 years has been astonishing. Since new types of taxes were established in the past 7 years, to ensure numerical completeness, even comparing the Provincial Tax amount of Shōwa 2 (17,220,145 wŏn) with that of Shōwa 5 (17,895,468 wŏn), it is an increase. Compared to Taishō 7, it is nearly a 17-fold increase. Furthermore, comparing the 9,945,203 wŏn of Taishō 11 (1922) with the 17,388,667 wŏn of Shōwa 3 (1928), it is a 1.7 percent [Note: This likely means 1.7 times or a 70% increase, not 1.7 percent] increase.

(3) Prefectural Taxes (府稅) and Their Trend
Having listed dozens of types under National Taxes and Provincial Taxes above, what else are these Prefectural Taxes? They are listed as follows: Land Tax Surtax, Income Surtax, Business Tax Surtax, Exchange Tax Surtax, Provincial House Tax Surtax, Provincial Ship Tax Surtax, Provincial Vehicle Tax Surtax, Provincial Special Income Tax Surtax, Household Rate (戶別稅), Special Household Rate (特別戶別稅), Special Business Tax (特別營業稅), Miscellaneous Taxes (雜種稅), Entertainment Tax (助興稅), Land Value Increment Tax (土地增價稅), Reclaimed Land Tax Exemption Area Rate (埋築免稅地坪數割), Benefit Tax (受盖稅), Special Income Tax (特別所得稅), etc., said to be 17 types. Examining their trend: (Unit: Wŏn)
[Table showing tax amounts for various Prefectural Taxes for Taishō 11 (1922), Shōwa 2 (1927), Shōwa 3 (1928), Shōwa 4 (1929), Shōwa 5 (1930)]
Examining the financial trend of the Prefectural Taxes listed above, while the land tax system and household/house tax systems increased as evidence of increased cultivated land and population, due to space constraints, comparative figures over the years could not be shown. However, the tax amount for the business tax system between Shōwa 2 and Shōwa 5 decreased by about 1.2 percent [Note: This calculation seems problematic in the original text, likely meaning a decrease compared to the period from Taishō 11 to Shōwa 1] compared to the tax amount between Taishō 11 (1922) and Shōwa 1 (1926). Ship Tax Surtax, Corporate Income Tax Surtax and Special Income Tax, Exchange Tax Surtax, Entertainment Tax, etc., were taxes established from Taishō 10 (1921), and except for the Entertainment Tax, they decreased. However, looking at the total Prefectural Tax amount, comparing 2,122,596 wŏn in Taishō 11 (1922) with 2,702,589 wŏn in Shōwa 5 (1930), it is a 1.2 [Note: likely 1.2 times or 20%] increase.

(4) Myŏn Levies (面賦課金) and Their Trend
Myŏn Levies are said to be Land Tax Assessment (地稅割), Business Tax Assessment (營業稅割), Special Business Assessment (特別營業割), Miscellaneous Assessment (雜種割), Mining Assessment (鑛業割), Household Assessment (戶別割), Fishery Assessment (漁業割), and Land Parcel Assessment (段別割). Examining their trend: (Unit: Thousand Wŏn) <37>
[Table showing amounts for various Myŏn Levies for Taishō 11 (1922), Shōwa 2 (1927), Shōwa 3 (1928), Shōwa 4 (1929), Shōwa 5 (1930)]
As shown in the figures above, Myŏn Levies have generally increased. Looking at the total, it was 11,587,366 wŏn in Taishō 11 (1922), and 13,484,229 wŏn in Shōwa 5 (1930), about a 1.2 [Note: likely 1.2 times or 20%] increase.
School Fee Levies (學校費 賦課金) are collected through the Household Tax and House Tax systems. Through the Household Tax system, it was 2,395,550 wŏn in Taishō 11, increasing to 3,261,757 wŏn in Shōwa 5. Through the House Tax system, it was 144,359 wŏn in Taishō 11, increasing to 183,975 wŏn in Shōwa 5.
In total, the amount paid directly and indirectly under all 417 [Note: This seems like a typo in the original, possibly meant 4 types or ~17 items under each?] tax items, including National Taxes, Provincial Taxes, Prefectural Taxes, Myŏn Levies, and School Fee Levies, is 92,340,338 wŏn. This does not include Japanese school association fees, donations, and other miscellaneous association fees.
If there were distinctions between Japanese and Koreans by tax item, the true burden on Koreans could be calculated, but due to the lack of data, I will try to indicate the degree of the Korean tax burden based on the direct tax burden limited to National Taxes.

3. Taxes and the Burden on Koreans
Due to the incompleteness of statistical data, although somewhat unsatisfactory, let's examine the burden based on figures from the 7 years from Taishō 11 (1922) to Shōwa 3 (1928) or between Shōwa 3 and 4 (1928-1929).

(1) National Tax Burden Amount (Direct Tax) (Unit: Wŏn)
[Table showing Korean Direct National Tax Burden from Taishō 11 (1922) to Shōwa 3 (1928)]
As the figures above indicate, it was 224,623 wŏn in Taishō 11 (1922), then gradually decreased, reaching 182,560 wŏn by Shōwa 1 (1926). Then, from Shōwa 2 (1927), it increased by about double compared to the previous year, reaching 344,359 wŏn, and further to 391,623 wŏn in Shōwa 3 (1928). This is said to be not because the tax rates were raised, but because newly established taxes increased. Examining this again on a per household and per capita average basis:
[Table showing Korean average per household and per capita Direct National Tax Burden from Taishō 11 (1922) to Shōwa 3 (1928)]
Comparing the burden amount between Japanese and Koreans, the Japanese burden in Taishō 11 was 1,142,244 wŏn, and in Shōwa 3, it was 1,706,234 wŏn. In terms of burden amount, the Japanese amount is decidedly larger than the Korean amount. However, looking at the percentage increase of the burden, comparing the Japanese 1.4 [times increase] to the Korean 1.7 [times increase], the fact that the percentage increase of the Korean burden <38> is decidedly heavier provides a good contrast.

(2) Provincial Tax Burden Amount

Provincial Tax Burden Year-over-Year Comparison Table
[Table showing Korean Provincial Tax Burden from Taishō 11 (1922) to Shōwa 3 (1928)]
The burden amount has increased year by year. Comparing that of Taishō 11 with that of Shōwa 3, it is truly a 1.4 [times] increase. Comparing the Korean burden amount with that of the Japanese: The Japanese burden in Taishō 11 was 410,378 wŏn, and in Shōwa 3, it was 630,075 wŏn. Examining the rate of increase, it is a 1.5 [times] increase. Now, let's examine the average burden per household and per capita.
[Table showing Korean average per household and per capita Provincial Tax Burden from Taishō 11 (1922) to Shōwa 3 (1928)]
Regarding the average per capita and per household for Provincial Taxes, unlike National Taxes, the rate of increase is minimal, and consequently, the Japanese rate of increase is greater than that of the Koreans. Now, investigating the entire Provincial Tax: (Unit: Wŏn)
[Table showing Total Provincial Tax Burden for Koreans and Japanese for Shōwa 3 (1928) and Shōwa 4 (1929)]

Comparing the burden amounts for Koreans versus Japanese in both years, the Korean burden increased by 16 percent [Note: likely means 1.16 times], while the Japanese burden increased by 1.1 percent [Note: likely 1.1 times]. Comparing the average burden per household, in Shōwa 3, it was 3.994 wŏn for Koreans and 16.631 wŏn for Japanese. In Shōwa 4, it was 4.21 wŏn for Koreans and 18.38 wŏn for Japanese. Thus, the rate of increase is said to be almost the same level at 1.0 percent [Note: Error in original, likely means ~1.05x for Koreans and ~1.1x for Japanese, or the percentage *point* increase]. Looking at the per capita average, in Shōwa 3, the Korean burden was 0.747 wŏn, while the Japanese burden was 4.352 wŏn. <39> In Shōwa 4, it was 0.79 wŏn for Koreans and 4.79 wŏn for Japanese. In terms of the rate of increase, it follows the same trend as the per household figures.

(3) Prefectural Tax (府稅) Burden Amount

As the Statistics of the Government-General of Korea (朝鮮總督府) present the direct tax burden amount without distinguishing between prefectures (府) and townships (面), I will compare the burden for Prefectural Taxes in general only for the two years Shōwa 2 and 3 [Note: Tables actually show Shōwa 3 and 4].
Year          Korean Burden Amount

Shōwa 3       609,954 Wŏn

Shōwa 4       698,120


Year          Japanese Burden Amount

Shōwa 3       1,347,201

Shōwa 4       1,257,857

In terms of burden amount, the Korean burden shows a 1.1 [times] increase, while the Japanese burden shows a 1.0 [times decrease, i.e., 0.93x]. Looking at the total burden amount, the Japanese amount is more than double. However, it is difficult to judge definitively based on comparing only these two years. Furthermore, the average burden per household and per capita follows the same trend, as shown in the statistical figures below.
[Table showing Average Per Household and Per Capita Prefectural Tax Burden for Koreans and Japanese for Shōwa 3 (1928) and Shōwa 4 (1929)]

(4) Myŏn Levy Burden

Similar to the Prefectural Tax burden, I will compare and examine only the two years Shōwa 3 and 4.
Year          Korean Burden Amount

Shōwa 3       11,873,524

Shōwa 4       11,901,010


Year          Japanese Burden Amount

Shōwa 3        1,439,786

Shōwa 4        1,509,672


Looking at the Myŏn Levy burden amount, both the Japanese and Korean burdens increased by 1 percent [Note: Calculation seems off, Korean increase is marginal, Japanese is ~5% or 1.05x]. However, the average per household decreased, while the average per capita increased. What does such a situation indicate? As the poverty of Koreans intensifies daily, the number of taxable households decreases, but the amount increases, and the per capita average increases.
[Table showing Average Per Household and Per Capita Myŏn Levy Burden for Koreans and Japanese for Shōwa 3 (1928) and Shōwa 4 (1929)]
The School Fee burden also increases in step with the Myŏn Levies. Thus, it was 3,269,390 wŏn in Shōwa 3, and is said to be 3,445,732 wŏn in Shōwa 4.
Conclusion
As discussed above, Korean taxes are increasing in terms of tax items, and consequently, the tax amount is also increasing. On the other hand, comparing the amount of tax delinquency in Taishō 10 (1921) with that in Shōwa 3 (1928), it is 1,020,729 wŏn versus 1,249,039 wŏn, a 1 percent [Note: calculation error, actually ~22% increase or 1.2x] increase. Comparing property seizures, it is 76,502 wŏn versus 253,099 wŏn, a 3.0 percent [Note: calculation error, actually ~230% increase or 3.3x] increase. Of course, expressed in such numerical terms, the current situation might seem minimal, but at this time when farm household debt alone is 500 million wŏn, the burden on Koreans cannot but be called excessive.
In concluding this discussion, it must be said that there is considerable regret regarding the analysis and comparison of the true situation due to the incompleteness of statistical data. It would suffice if, through this discussion, however insufficient, the reader and I could grasp just the trend ("tendency" - 텐덴씨). <40>

**Summary**

This 1932 article by Kim U-p'yŏng details the structure and increasing trend of taxes (national, provincial, prefectural, and myŏn levies) in colonial Korea between the late 1910s and 1930. Using available statistics, Kim demonstrates that both the number of tax types and the total tax revenue were rising significantly. While Japanese residents paid higher absolute amounts in many categories, the *rate* of increase in the tax burden was often steeper for Koreans, particularly in national taxes. The author concludes that despite potentially misleading statistics on delinquency or seizures appearing minimal as percentages (though the calculations seem flawed), the overall tax burden on Koreans, especially considering widespread rural debt, was becoming excessively heavy.

For historians, this article offers valuable contemporary data and perspective on the colonial economic system, specifically the structure and impact of taxation. The explicit comparison between the tax burdens of Koreans and Japanese residents highlights the differential economic pressures within the colony. The author's attempt to quantify the burden, despite data limitations acknowledged, and linking it to social issues like farmer debt and property seizures, provides insight into the lived economic realities and growing hardships faced by Koreans under Japanese rule. The mention of specific tax types and their evolution is also useful for understanding colonial fiscal policy.

						金佑枰
1. 우리는 稅金을 얼마나 내나?
1. 우리의 負擔은 重한가 輕한가?
1. 稅金은 늘어가나 줄어가나?
實生活과 緊切한 關係가 잇는 諸問題의 討論

1. 머릿말
個人의 살림사리에 相當한 金錢이 必要한 것같이 1國家政府의 살림사리에도 이에 相當한 金錢이 必要한 것이다. 個人은 그 生活資金을 求하되 財産과 職業에 依하며 이 두 가지로도 不足하다든지 或은 없다면 債金에 依하기도 한다. 國家政府도 個人과 같이 國家所有의 官有財産, 官營機關에서도 그 收入을 取할 뿐 아니라 個人으로서는 不可能한 租稅에 依하야 그 收入을 求하는 것이다. 然故로 租稅라는 것은 國家政府의 獨特한 收入資源이다. 財政的으로 獨特하며 國家政府 對 人民關係로 보아 獨特하다는 것이다. 卽 다시 말하자면 國家政府의 收入 卽 歲入 中 租稅라는 것은 經濟的으로 政治的으로 重大한 것이다. 웨 그러냐하면 租稅라는 것은 國家政府가 權力으로써 國民全體의 公共的 費用에 充當하기 爲하야 自國 內의 人과 物에 依하야 金錢的 負擔을 强要하는 때문이다. 그러므로 1國家 人民의 租稅負擔이란 것이 人民 그 自體의 生活에 至大한 關係가 잇다는 것이다. 이에 우리의 生活에 如斯히 至大한 關係를 가지고 잇는 朝鮮의 租稅를 論하야 보자. 勿論 租稅라하면 그 論點의 範圍가 廣大하니까 東光編輯人의 請에 依하야 特히 租稅의 種目과 그 金額을 論하기 爲하야 朝鮮租稅의 趨勢를 論하야 朝鮮人의 負擔을 指摘하랴 한다.

2. 租稅와 그 趨勢
朝鮮의 租稅體系를 考察하면 (1) 國稅, (2) 地方稅, (3) 府稅, (4) 面賦課金 等으로 分하여 잇다.

(1) 國稅와 그 趨勢

그러면 國稅는 무엇을 가르침인가? (1) 地稅 (2) 所得稅 (3) 營業稅 (4) 資本利子稅 (5) 取引所稅 (6) 取引稅 (7) 鑛稅 (8) 酒稅 (9) 砂糖消費稅 (10) 印紙稅 (11) 登錄稅 (12) 朝鮮銀行券發行稅 等으로서 中央政府에 納入하는 稅들이다. 이에 此等 國稅 ＜35＞ 稅目에 依하야 그 趨勢를 論하건대 이러하다.

(가) 地稅

地稅는 朝鮮稅制 中 가장 重要한 地位를 占領하엿다. 經濟的으로나 政治的으로 重要하다는 것이다. 經濟的으로 말하면 大正7年엔 稅額이 겨우 11,220,851圓이엇든 것이 昭和 4年度에는 一躍 15,665,074圓으로서 朝鮮稅額 中 第1位를 占領하엿으며 納稅 義務者數로 본다면 大正7年엔 3,374,279人이엇든 것이 昭和4年에 至하여는 4,006,667人이라 한다. 昭和 4年度 納稅義務者 中 日本人 86,858人과 外國人 2,087人을 除한다 하드라도 그 數는 吾人의 豫想보다도 過多하게 增加되엇다. 뿐만 아니라 納稅 義務者 納額 別 人員으로는 5百圓 以上 稅金을 納入하는 者로서 朝鮮人은 昭和4年度 統計에 依하야 364人인데 日本人은 525人으로서 斷然이 日本人의 數가 朝鮮人의 數보다 多하다는 것이다. 그리하야 朝鮮人口의 8割强이 農民이란 것을 이에 聯想한다면 政治的 으로 또한 重大性을 가젓다 아니할 수 없다.

(나) 所得稅

所得稅란 것은 負擔公平이란 見地에서 比較的 進步된 稅制이라 한다. 이에 그 發達過程을 考察하건대 大正10年엔 겨우 786,346圓이엇든 것이 昭和4年度에는 1,301,460圓으로 近 倍額에 達하리만큼 增加되엇으며 納稅者 數도 大正10年엔 295人이든 것이 昭和 4年엔 1304人이란 數字로 6倍나 增加되엇다.
朝鮮에서는 個人 所得에 對한 所得稅가 아니라 法人의 普通所得, 超過所得, 淸算所得에 對한 課稅이나 稅制의 必然的 發達에 依하야 생각건대 朝鮮에서도 所得稅라는 것이 將來 有望하게 될 것이 事實일가 한다. 如斯히 重要性을 가진 稅에 對하야는 朝鮮의 負擔能力이라든지 將來 能力을 考察하고 싶으나 參考資料의 不完全으로 因하야 數字的 分析과 推斷을 하지 못함은 遺憾으로 생각하는 것이다.

(다) 營業稅

營業稅는 地稅라든지 所得稅에 比하야 比較的 新稅로서 昭和 2年에 創設된 것으로 同年度엔 9萬7千圓에 達하엿다. 所得稅에 잇어서와 같이 民族別 納入額을 參考할만한 資料가 無하므로 이에 略한다.

(라) 資本利子稅

資本利子稅 亦 營業稅와 同年度에 創設된 것으로 昭和 2年度엔 317,579圓이엇는데 同5年度엔 337,705圓에 達하얏다.

(마) 鑛稅

鑛稅는 以上 論한 諸稅와 그 「텐덴씨」가 달러 大正7年度에 626,914圓이엇든 것이 昭和5年度에는 544,849圓으로 減少되엇다. 다시 昭和 2年度 505千圓에 比하면 增加된 세음이라 한다.

(바) 其他稅   (單位 千圓)
以上 統計 數字에 依하건대 朝鮮銀行券 發行稅, 取引所稅 及 煙草耕作稅는 各各 減少되엇으며 酒稅를 爲始하야 其他는 全部 增加되엇다. 통터러 國稅의 一般的 趨勢를 考察한다면 增加2字로 說明할 ＜36＞ 수 잇다는 것이다.

(2) 地方稅와 그 趨勢

朝鮮에 現行되는 地方稅 稅目은 地稅附加稅, 所得稅附加稅, 戶稅, 家屋稅, 特別市場稅, 屠畜稅 及 屠場稅, 漁業稅, 船稅, 車輛稅 及 不動産取得稅 等이다. 이에 個別的 趨勢를 考察하건대 이러하다.
(單位 千圓)
以上 數字에 依하건대 船稅를 除外로 過去 12年間 그 增加額은 可驚할만큼 되엇다. 過去 7年間 新種目의 稅가 創設되엇으므로 數字的 完全을 期하기 爲하야 昭和2年度의 地方稅額을 同5年度의 그것에 比較한다 하드라도 17,220,145, 對 17,895,468이며, 大正 7年度의 그것에 比하면 近 17倍의 增加이다. 다시 大正11年度의 9,945,203圓을 昭和 3年의 17,388,667圓에 比하면 1.7퍼센트의 增加이다.

(3) 府稅와 그 趨勢
國稅이니 地方稅니 하야 以上에 數十 餘 種目을 擧하엿다. 그러면 이 以外에 府稅라는 것은 무엇인가 列擧하면 이러하다. 地稅附加稅, 所得附加稅, 營業稅附加稅, 取引所稅附加稅, 地方稅家屋稅附加稅, 地方稅般稅附加稅, 地方稅車輛稅附加稅, 地方稅特別所得稅附加稅, 戶別稅, 特別戶別稅, 特別營業稅, 雜種稅, 助興稅, 土地增價稅, 埋築免稅地坪數割, 受盖稅. 特別所得稅 等 17種目이라 한다. 이에 그 趨勢를 考察하건대 이러하다.   (單位 圓)
以上 擧한 바 府稅의 財政的 趨勢를 考察하건대 耕作地面과 人口가 增加된 證據로 지세계통과 戶稅 及 家屋稅 系統이 增加된 것은 勿論이나 紙面關係로 累年 比較 數字는 表하지 못하엿으나 營業稅系統은 大正11年度부터 昭和 元年度 間의 稅額보다 昭和 2年度부터 同 5年度 間의 稅額은 約 1.2퍼센트나 減少되엇다. 船稅附加稅, 法人所得稅附加稅 及 特別所得稅, 取引所稅附加稅, 助興稅 等은 大正10年度부터 創設된 稅로서 助興稅를 除한 外에는 減少되엇다. 그러나 府稅額 全部로 보아 大正11年度의 2,122,596圓 對 昭和5年度의 2,702,589圓을 比較하건대 1,2퍼센트의 增加일다.

(4) 面賦課金과 그 趨勢
面賦課金이란 것은 地稅割, 營業稅割, 特別營業割, 雜種割, 鑛業割, 戶別割, 漁業割 及 段別割 等이라 한다. 이에 그 趨勢를 檢討하건대 이러하다.  (單位 千圓) ＜37＞
面賦課金도 以上 數字에 表示되엇음과 같이 一般的으로 增加되엇다. 合計로 본다면 大正 11年度에는 11,587,366圓이엇는데 昭和 5年度에는 13,484,229圓으로서 約 1.2퍼센트의 增加일다.
學校費 賦課金이라는 것은 戶稅 及 家屋稅系統에서 徵收되는 것으로서 戶稅系統으로는 大正11年에는 2,395,550圓이엇든 것이 昭和 5年에는 3,261,757圓으로 增加되엇으며 家屋稅系統으로는 大正 11年에는 144,359圓이엇든 것이 昭和 5年度에는 183,975圓으로 增加되엇다.
以上 國稅, 地方稅, 府稅, 及 面賦課金이라든지 學校費賦課金에 至하기까지 全部 417稅目 下에 直接間接으로 納入하는 金額이 92,340,338圓이다. 이中에는 日本人의 學校組合費, 寄附金 及 其他 諸會費는 包含되지 아니 하얏다.
稅目에 依하야 日本人 及 朝鮮人의 別이 잇다면 朝鮮人의 眞正한 負擔을 計算할 수 잇으나 資料가 無한 탓으로 國稅에 限하야는 直接稅 負擔으¡œ 朝鮮人의 租稅負擔程度를 表示하여 볼가 한다.

3. 租稅와 朝鮮人의 負擔
統計資料의 不完全으로 因하야 좀 不滿足하나마 大正 11年度부터 昭和 3年度까지 7年間 或은 昭和 3,4年間의 數字에 依하야 負擔을 考察하야 보자.

(1) 國稅負擔額  (直接稅) (單位圓)
이상 數字가 表示한 것과 같이 大正 11年度에 224,623圓이엇다가 그後 漸次 減少되어 昭和元年度에는 182,560圓에 까지 至하엿다. 그리하야 昭和 2年度부터 前年度에 比하야 約 倍假量 增加하야 實로 344,359圓이엇으며 同 3年度에는 391,623圓에 達하엿다. 이것은 稅率을 引上하므로 稅額이 增加된 것이 아니라 新設한 稅가 增加된 까닭이라 한다. 이것을 다시 1戶 及 1人 平均으로 考察한다면 이러하다.
負擔額으로 日本人과 朝鮮人을 比較하건대 大正11年의 日本人 負擔은 1,142,244圓이엇으며, 昭和3年度에는 1,706,234圓이라 한다. 負擔額으로 본다면 日本人의 그것이 斷然 朝鮮의 그것보다 多額이라 하겟으나 그 負擔增加 퍼센트로 본다면 日本人의 1.4 對 朝鮮人의 1.7로 朝鮮人 負擔의 增加 ＜38＞ 퍼센트가 斷然히 重하다는 것은 좋은 對照일가 한다.

(2) 地方稅負擔額

地方稅負擔累年比較表

負擔額은 逐年 增加되엇다. 大正 11年의 그것과 昭和 3年度 그것을 比較하건대 實로 1.4퍼센트의 增加일다. 朝鮮人의 負擔額을 日本人의 그것에 比較하건대 이러하다. 大正 11年의 日本人 負擔은 410,378圓이엇으며 昭和3年度에는 630,075圓이엇다. 그 增加率을 考察하건대 1.5퍼센트의 增加일다. 이에 1戶 及 1人當 平均負擔을 考察하면 이러하다.

道 地方稅의 1人當 及 1戶當 平均에 잇어서는 國稅와 不同하야 그 增加率이 微微하며 따라서 日本人의 增加率이 朝鮮人의 그것에 比하야 더하다. 이에 地方稅 全體에 對하야 調査하건대 이러하다.        (單位圓)


兩年度의 朝鮮人 對 日本人의 負擔額을 比較하건대 朝鮮人은 16퍼센트의 增加이며 日本人은 1.1퍼센트의 增加일다. 1戶當 平均 負擔을 比較하건대 昭和 3年度 朝鮮人은 3,994圓이며 日本人은 16,631圓이다. 昭和 4年度에는 朝鮮人은 4,21圓이며 日本人은 18,38圓이다. 그리하야 그 增加率은 거이 同1程度의 1.0퍼센트이라 한다. 1人當 平均으로 본다면 昭和 3年度의 朝鮮人 負擔은 0.747圓인데 日本人의 그것은 4,352圓이며 ＜39＞ 昭和 4年度에는 朝鮮人은 0.79圓이며 日本人은 479圓이다. 그 增加率로 말하면 1戶當에 잇어서 다같은 趨勢일다.

(3) 府稅負擔額

朝鮮總督府 統計에는 直接稅 負擔額을 表하되 府面을 分別하지 아니 하얏으므로 府稅 一般에 對한 負擔을 昭和2, 3 兩年度 것만을 比較하랴 한다.
年次          朝鮮人負擔額

昭和3年度       609,954圓

昭和4年度       698,120


年次          日本人負擔額

昭和3年       1,347,201

昭和4年       1,257,857

負擔額에 잇어서 朝鮮人은 1.1퍼센트의 增加인데 日本人은 反히 1.0퍼센트의 減少이다. 負擔액 全體로 본다면 日本人의 그것이 倍以上 多하다. 그러면 다만 兩年度의 分을 比較하야 左右를 論하기는 難하다. 다시 1戶當 及 1人當 平均 負擔도 以下의 統計 數字와 같이 同一한 趨勢일다.

(4) 面賦課金負擔

府稅負擔과 如히 昭和3,4 兩年度 分만을 比較考察하려 한다.
年次          朝鮮人負擔額

昭和3年       11,873,524

昭和4年       11,901,010


年次          日本人負擔額

昭和3年        1,439,786

昭和4年        1,509,672


面賦課金 負擔額으로 보면 日本人이나 朝鮮人 負擔이 같이 1퍼센트 增加되엇다. 그러나 1戶當 平均은 減少되엇으며 1人當 平均은 增加되엇다. 如斯한 現狀은 무엇을 말함인가? 朝鮮人의 貧窮은 매일 激化되어 가므로 課稅戶數는 減少되나 그 金額은 增加하는 것이며 1人當平均은 增加되어 가는 것이다.
學校費負擔額도 面賦課金과 同一한 步調로 增加되어 간다. 그리하야 昭和 3年度에는 3,269,390圓이든 것이 昭和 4年度에는 3,445,732圓이라 한다.
結論
如斯히 以上에 論한 바와 如히 朝鮮租稅가 그 稅目에 잇어서 增加되어 가며 따라서 稅額도 增加되어 간다. 그 反面으로 大正 10年度 稅金滯納額과 昭和 3年度의 그것을 比較하건대 1,020,729圓 對 1,249,039圓으로서 1퍼센트의 增加이며 財産差押에 依하야 比較하면 76,502圓 對 253,099圓으로서 3.0퍼센트 增加이라 한다. 勿論 如斯한 數字的 表示로 말하면 그 現狀이 微微하다 할지나 農家負債만이 5億圓인 此時 朝鮮人의 負擔이 過重타 아니할 수 없다.
이에 本論을 끝냄에 際하야 統計資料의 不完全으로 因하야 그 眞相의 分析과 比較에 遺憾이 不少하다 아니할 수 없다. 다만 本論에 依하야 不充分하나마 讀者와 함께 그 텐덴씨만을 吟味한다면 足할가 한다.＜40＞
