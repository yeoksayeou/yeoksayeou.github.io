Needle Big, Stick Small

Portugal has suspended gold conversion. Who's next?

The League of Nations Manchuria investigation commission, delayed due to difficulty selecting personnel, has finally confirmed its members. The chairman is said to be the British poet Lord Lytton. With the skill he used to write "The Last Days of Pompeii," perhaps he'll try reciting "The Last Days of Chinchou (錦州)."

In Fengtian (奉天), Chinese citizens reportedly held a "Bandit Extermination Movement" (殲匪運動) on New Year's Day, but the Chinchou army completely fled that day – truly, effective as divine intervention (奏効如神).

In Harbin, there was a great struggle between Chinese and Russians. Did the Russians seem like easy targets?

Gandhi, having entered prison, boasted, "I resist because I love Britain." Loving one's enemy infringes on Jesus's patent right.

Chang Ching-hui (張景惠) in Heilungchiang (黑龍江), Hsi Hsia (熙哈) in Kirin (吉林), and Wei Shih-yi (威式毅) in Fengtian (奉天) have each taken office as new masters. The United States makes noise about non-recognition, but Japan's recognition is all that matters.

Feng Yü-hsiang (馮玉詳) has appeared in Nanking after a long time. As usual, his worn-out clothes and broken hat (弊衣破笠) are popular. Setting aside his big talk, what is he plotting now in the Shanghai Concession (上海 租界)?

In India, the policy is to ban newspaper articles; in China, they declare the abolition of <20> newspaper censorship. That was then, this is now (此一時 彼一時).

An International Goods Exchange Research Association has been formed to defend the gold standard system. If barter (物物交換) revives, will civilization reverse?

The movement for municipal management of electricity in Kyŏngsŏng has transformed into a movement to retain council members. The flaws of the incomplete system (不具的 制度) are one thing, but the indecisiveness of the municipal council members is also utterly disgraceful (醜態百出).

Trouble has arisen again with the joint sales of kerosene (鎾油共販). As long as joint sales aren't truly joint sales and become a monopoly (獨買), such incidents will occur frequently.

In Munch'ŏn, "fists" (주먹 - gangsters) were arrested. How were the handcuffs (手匣) put on them?

The Compensation Law (補償法) is to be implemented in Chosŏn too, but with 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th classes assigned. Which gentlemen (량반) will become 1st class, and which groups (무리) will become 2nd, 3rd, and 4th?

Poverty relief project funds are reportedly left over, not fully spent. Have the people needing relief disappeared?

An American youth is said to have sent a job application to the Chōsen Government-General (朝鮮總督府). Wait a little longer and try applying to the Manchurian Government-General (滿洲總督府).

"Our" ship, the Fushiki Maru (伏木丸), is said to have been repaired and set sail after running aground. Its spirit (意氣) is even more inspiring (壯快).

A memorial service (追悼會) is said to be held for compatriots who suffered disaster in Manchuria (滿洲遭難同胞). It is truly regrettable (참말 어굴하오).

Promotion of domestic products (物産獎勵) is being persistently pursued in Kyŏngsŏng and P'yŏngyang. At the same time, rumors are heard of Ōsaka textile factories advancing into Chosŏn. <21>

**Summary**

This article from January 1932 presents a series of short, often sarcastic news briefs and commentaries on diverse topics. It covers international affairs like Portugal abandoning the gold standard and the League of Nations' Manchuria commission, events in China (Manchurian situation, Feng Yü-hsiang's return, censorship changes), India (Gandhi's imprisonment), and domestic Korean issues under Japanese rule, including political squabbles in Kyŏngsŏng over electricity management, problems with joint kerosene sales, the implementation of a classed compensation law, questions about poverty relief funds, the arrest of gangsters, and the promotion of domestic products. It also touches upon the Fushiki Maru ferry and expresses sorrow for Koreans suffering in Manchuria. From a historical perspective, the article offers a glimpse into contemporary Korean commentary on the escalating Manchurian crisis, Japanese colonial policies, global events affecting East Asia, and the socio-economic conditions within Korea. The critical and sometimes mocking tone towards Japanese actions, colonial administration, and even international bodies, alongside concern for fellow Koreans and domestic economic initiatives, would be of interest to historians studying Korean perspectives during the colonial period.

針大棒小
葡萄牙가 金兌換을 停止햇다. 다음은 누구 次例.

人選難으로 遲滯中이던 國際聯盟 滿洲問題調査委員은 겨우 人選確定. 委員長은 英國詩人 리튼 卿이라고. 「폼페最後日」짓든 솜씨로 「錦州最後日」이나 한번 을퍼 볼 일.

奉天에서는 正月元旦에 中國市民이 「殲匪運動」을 햇다는데 錦州軍은 그 날에 全部 뺑손이를 첫스니 이야말로 奏効如神.

哈爾頻서는 中露人의 大鬪爭劇이 잇섯다. 露國人이 만만해 뵈엇든 모양인가.

獄에 들어간 간디는 「英國을 사랑하기 따문에 抗爭하는 것이라」고 氣焰을 吐햇다. 원수를 사랑하라는 것은 예수의 特許權 侵害.

張景惠는 黑龍江에, 熙哈은 吉林에, 威式毅는 奉天에 各其 新主人으로 就任. 米國은 否認한다고 떠들지만 日本이 是認하면 그만.

馮玉詳君이 오래간 만에 南京에 出現. 例에 依하야 弊衣破笠이 人氣. 大言壯語는 어디두고 요새는 上海 租界서 무엇을 꾸미는 中인가.

印度에서는 新聞記事 禁止方針이요 中國에서는 ＜20＞ 新聞檢閣 廢止를 聲明. 此一時 彼一時.

金本位制擁護를 爲하야 國際物資交換所 設置硏究會가 생겻다. 物物交換이 復活되면 文明은 逆轉乎.

京城의 電氣府營運動은 議員挽留運動으로 轉換해 버렷다. 不具的 制度의 罪도 잇거니와 府議員들의 無定見도 醜態百出.

鎾油共販에 또 말성이 부텃다. 共販이 정말 共販이 못되고 獨買가 되는 限에 이런 일은 百出.

文川에서는 「주먹」을 檢擧. 手匣은 어떠케 채웟나.

補償法은 朝鮮서도 實施하되 但 1 2 3 4 等級을 부친다고. 1等은 어떤 량반이 되고 2 3 4等은 어떤 무리가 되랴는가.

窮民救濟事業은 預算이 다 나가지 않고 남아 돌아간다고. 救濟받을 사람이 없어젓든가.

米國靑年이 朝鮮總督府로 就職願書를 보냇다 한다. 조곰더 기다려서 滿洲總督府로 志願해 보시오.

우리들의 배 伏木丸이 좌초후 修繕出發햇다한다. 그 意氣가 一層 壯快.

滿洲遭難同胞 追悼會를 開催한다고. 참말 어굴하오.

物産獎勵는 京城과 平壤서 꾸준이 活動. 大阪纖維工場의 朝鮮 進出說이 同時에 들리오 들. ＜21＞
＜20-21＞
