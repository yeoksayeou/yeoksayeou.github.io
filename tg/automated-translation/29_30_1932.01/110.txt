An Analysis of the Korean Police - Examining the Use of 30 Million Yen Annually -, Involvement in Overall Administration, Wielding Absolute Power
						Kim Tongjin

While it may not only be in Korea (朝鮮) that military and police forces play an absolute role in colonial rule, Korea has only recently emerged from the Gendarmerie Police era and is still in the early stages of the Police Politics era. Therefore, the police in Korea possess significantly more power compared to other places.

Authorities raise objections and even express anger towards calling Korea a state of "Police Politics" (警察政治), but given the numerous pieces of evidence proving that the current reality cannot escape being an era of Police Politics, it cannot be helped. For example, even just from the author's memory:

1.  The general severity of the Police Offences Punishment Rules (警察犯取締規則).
2.  The long duration of detention (留置) and arrest (檢束).
3.  Police station chiefs handling prosecutor's affairs.
4.  Handling civil dispute mediation affairs.
5.  Handling bailiff's affairs.
6.  Patrolmen (巡査) (even those not Police Sergeants (巡査部長)) performing judicial police officer duties.
7.  Performing various administrative assistance duties.

Etc. It goes without saying that Korea's Police Offences Punishment Rules are stricter than Japan's "Police Offences Punishment Ordinance" (警察犯取締令), and the long duration of arrests and detentions is the police's greatest weapon. This makes the people try to curry favor with police officials, consequently boosting the self-importance of some thoughtless officers, becoming a major reason why Korea incurs criticism as a state of "Police Politics." Furthermore, regarding item 7, "various administrative assistance duties," while it may partly be due to the underdeveloped state of transportation, public knowledge, and administrative organs in Korea, police officers are involved not only in road construction, forest protection, customs affairs in border regions, tax collection, pest extermination, fishery regulation, surveillance of Monopoly Edict violations, and donation activities, but also extend their involvement to the promotion of industry, side businesses, and savings. With police officers involved in every aspect of these administrative agency affairs, what more is needed to call Korea a state of "Police Politics"? Police officers handle the work of the county office's finance section, general affairs section, the Monopoly Bureau's work, customs affairs, the Government-General's Forestry Department work, the Industrial Development Bureau's Fisheries Section and Agricultural Affairs Section work, the Communications Bureau work, the Internal Affairs Bureau work, the sub-county head's work, the district head's work – in any case, police power is mobilized in all administrative affairs. While the essence of such mobilization of police power is not intended for interference but to assist underdeveloped administrative agencies, the assistive meddling of those with power always entails the flaw of suppressing one party. Thus, the administrative assistance duties of the Korean police, while having advantageous points for the Government-General's rule,<28> also tend to instill fear in the populace and incur much resentment.

Police Duty Distribution and Organization Content of Each Agency

So, what is the organization of the police agency possessing such absolute authority, and how are the duties distributed among the various agencies? Everyone knows that above the Police Station is the Police Department, above the Police Department is the Police Affairs Bureau (警務局), and below the Police Station are Substations (駐在所), Temporary Posts (出張所), and Police Boxes (派出所). However, what specific duties each agency undertakes, the number of police personnel, and the police budget are matters of general knowledge and interest, so I will try to write about them as simply as possible.

The highest agency is the Police Affairs Bureau (警務局). The Bureau has a Director (局長) of Chokuninkan rank who manages all police affairs under the orders of the Governor-General (總督) and the Superintendent-General (總監). Within the Police Affairs Bureau, the organization under the Director is divided into four sections: Police Affairs (警務), Security (保安), Publications (圖書), and Sanitation (衛生), and there is also a separately established Police Officer Training Center (警察官講習所). Looking at the duty distribution of each section:

Police Affairs Section (警務課) = Matters concerning administrative police; matters concerning police districts and the assignment and service of police personnel; matters concerning guards and security; matters concerning police uniforms, firearms, ammunition, and accessories; matters concerning merit badges for police officials and firefighting officials; border security; matters concerning one-time payments to police personnel and bereaved families; matters concerning military affairs; matters not belonging to the jurisdiction of other sections within the bureau.

Security Section (保安課) = Matters concerning higher police (思想警察, thought police); matters concerning laborer recruitment; matters concerning foreign affairs police.

Publications Section (圖書課) = Matters concerning newspapers, magazines, and publications; matters concerning copyright; matters concerning the possession of censored newspapers, magazines, and publications; matters concerning motion picture censorship.

Sanitation Section (衛生課) = General affairs concerning public health; appointment/dismissal and regulation of doctors, medical practitioners (醫生), pharmacists, nurses, midwives, and patent medicine sellers; matters concerning cemeteries.

Police Officer Training Center (警察官講習所) = Training for Japanese patrolmen (巡査) and general police officer training below the rank of Police Inspector (警部).

In each Province (道), under the Provincial Governor (道知事), there is a Provincial Police Chief (警察部長), and below him are various sections such as Police Affairs (警務), Higher Police (高等), Security (保安), Sanitation (衛生), and Criminal Affairs (刑事) (only in Kyŏnggi-do (京畿道)). The distribution of duties is largely similar to the Police Affairs Bureau, but the duties of the Police Affairs Bureau's Security Section are handled by the Higher Police Section (高等課), and the Provincial Security Section (保安課) solely handles security police affairs not belonging to the Provincial Higher Police Section, firefighting affairs, and judicial police affairs. However, only Kyŏnggi-do has a Criminal Affairs Section (刑事課) established, which serves as the central headquarters for judicial police affairs of all provinces and for the scientific investigation and fingerprint collection of criminals throughout Korea. Also, each province has a Patrolman Training Center (巡査敎習所), which is solely an educational institution for training Korean police officers.

The division of duties in a Police Station is similar to the Police Department, divided into five sections: Police Affairs (警務), Higher Police (高等), Judicial (司法), Sanitation (衛生), and Security (保安). Although a Higher Police section is established in every station, in stations where higher police affairs are minimal, it is common for the chief of that section to be concurrently held by a senior station official or the station chief. Below the Police Station are Substations (駐在所), Police Boxes (派出所), and Temporary Posts (出張所). Substations are established in 면 (myŏn, township) centers or important villages outside the Police Station location, Police Boxes are established at important points within the Police Station location, and Temporary Posts are established for border security or temporarily due to urgent circumstances. Besides these, Patrolmen's Lookout Posts (巡査見張所) were temporarily established in some cities, but most have now been abolished. Substations and Temporary Posts have the authority to handle judicial police officer duties restored, but the exercise of this authority by Patrolmen in Police Boxes is restricted.

The organization of the police is as described above. Provincial police administration is based on Article 13 of the Government-General of Korea's Local Government System (朝鮮總督府 地方官制):
"The Provincial Police Chief (警察部長), concerning the execution of police and sanitation affairs, under the command of the Governor (知事), directs and supervises the subordinate Police Superintendents (警視), Police Inspectors (警部), Assistant Police Inspectors (警部補), Patrolmen (巡査), and Firefighters (消防手)."
Based on this, it is the Governor's authority, but according to Article 8 of the Government-General of Korea's Regulations on Delegated Matters (朝鮮總督府 委任事項 規定), under the clause "The Director of the Police Affairs Bureau (警務局長) shall exclusively handle the following matters," the authority to direct and supervise all police matters is delegated.
Although authority is granted to the Governor according to Article 13 of the Local Government System,<29> allowing him to issue commands and orders freely, in reality, police affairs are solely under the authority of the Director of the Police Affairs Bureau based on Article 8 of the Regulations on Delegated Matters. Because of this, the relationship between the two is delicate, sometimes producing amusing situations, such as the case where Yu Chinsun (劉鎭淳), then Governor of Ch'ungnam (忠南), took responsibility for the disturbance during the Provincial Office relocation incident and resigned. While the Governor's possession of police authority is guaranteed by law, it is customary that, depending on the type of Governor, they rarely intervene. However, they must bear the responsibility. Another example is the retirement (though not solely for this reason) of Mr. Sonoda (園田), former Governor of P'yŏngnam (平南), due to the incident of assault against Chinese people.

Security facilities are, in principle, established with one police station per pu (府, city) or kun (郡, county), but depending on local circumstances, there can be two or more police stations. As of the most recent count, the number of police stations is 251, exceeding the number of pu, kun, and islands by 19. The number of Substations (駐在所) is 2,299, Police Boxes (派出所) number 183, and Temporary Posts (出張所) number 138. In addition, there are 5 steamships and 16 motorboats as patrol vessels, and the security telephone lines extend to 2,576 ri (里) and 30 chō (町) [approx. 10,130 km], enabling direct communication with the Police Affairs Bureau in all 13 provinces except Hamhuk (咸北) and Chŏnnam (全南). The security telephone line extension of over 2,576 ri is about four times longer than the public telephone lines (646 ri).

Besides these, automobiles and motorcycles reach 50 units, and horses number over 70 (Omitted). Furthermore, each station is equipped with one or two cameras and fingerprint kits, presenting a imposing appearance.

Gradual Disappearance of Korean Cadres

The authorized number of police officers is over 18,700, but the current number is 17,726. Broken down, this includes: Provincial Police Chiefs 13, Police Superintendents (警視) Japanese 47, Korean 8; Police Inspectors (警部) Japanese 330, Korean 716; Assistant Police Inspectors (警部補) Japanese 558, Korean 118; Police Sergeants (巡査部長) Japanese 2,751, Korean 312; Patrolmen (巡査) Japanese 7,072, Korean 6,443. Total: Japanese 10,769, Korean 6,957.

Comparing the increase/decrease in current police personnel between immediately after the police system reform in Taishō 8 (1919) and the present, except for patrolmen, the number of Koreans has decreased across the board, while the number of Japanese has increased in all categories. Particularly noticeable is the significant decrease in Korean cadre officers such as Police Superintendents (警視), Police Inspectors (警部), and Assistant Police Inspectors (警部補).

The police budget for the 5th year of Shōwa (1930) was 29,125,308 yen. Among this, the most significant expenditure is salaries. Glancing at the salaries for the 6th year of Shōwa (1931):
Provincial Police Chiefs: 62,972 yen; Police Superintendents: 131,360 yen; Police Inspectors: 597,600 yen; Assistant Police Inspectors: 679,698 yen; Patrolmen: 12,227,544 yen. Total: 13,719,174 yen. Of this, the income received by Koreans is merely over 4.36 million yen.

Besides salaries, an important expenditure is administrative costs. Noteworthy items within this include: 150 firearms, new procurement cost 22,700 yen; 200 patrolmen's swords, new procurement cost 1,800 yen; firearm repair cost 2,700 yen; ammunition cost 7,000 yen, etc. The cost of a patrolman's uniform averages 15 yen 60 sen per person, and the clothing allowance provided to plainclothes patrolmen is 316 yen 50 sen. The allowance for detectives (刑事), whose numbers are increasing recently, is 40,000 yen.

How much are the costs for detention facilities, criminal arrests, police officer travel expenses, and prisoner escort costs? The total budget is 568,605 yen. This budget assumes a total of 729,123 person-days for people eating meals in detention facilities, calculated at an average food cost of 27 sen per person per day, totaling 196,864 yen, plus travel expenses, food expenses for suspect and prisoner escorting patrolmen and prisoners, detention facility equipment costs, miscellaneous expenses, etc. It costs 570,000 yen to arrest people and be arrested. (Omitted)

230,000 Criminal Arrests

How many people are arrested by the police? Including temporary detentions, it might reach several hundred thousand, but according to statistical yearbooks, the criminal arrest situation in the 4th year of Shōwa (1929) was <30> 235,608 cases involving 279,573 individuals. Compared to the population of Korea, this is 1 in 70, meaning 1 out of every 70 people was arrested by the police under suspicion of a crime or for committing a crime.

As mentioned earlier, regulations in Korea are overly detailed and severe, leading to many people being apprehended by the police. An example proving this is the small number of people indicted among those suspected criminals sent from police stations to the prosecutor's office. Specifically, according to statistics from the 5th year of Shōwa (1930), out of 124,356 cases involving 190,380 people received by the prosecutor's office, 123,585 cases involving 188,708 people were processed that year. The result of this processing was that prosecutor indictments amounted to merely 46,915 cases involving 54,289 people, while the rest were released due to suspension of prosecution, non-prosecution, suspended indictment, acquittal, etc. Doesn't this roughly indicate the situation in this area?

The urgent need for revision of the Police Offences Punishment Rules (警察犯取締規則) and various laws that disrespect fundamental human rights requires no noisy advocacy. Besides this rule, among various other laws, many are unsuitable for the level of public awareness (民度) in Korea. For example, the Forestry Edict (森林令) and Monopoly Edict (專賣令); as a result of rigorously enforcing these edicts in recent years, the number of offenders has surged dramatically. The number of special law violation cases, which was only 15,960 in Taishō 13 (1924), reached 39,894 in Taishō 5 [Typo: likely meant Shōwa 5, 1930]. Since ancient times, dissatisfied farmers in impoverished rural villages spent little money due to makgeolli (막걸리, unrefined rice wine) and leaf tobacco (葉草). Moreover, makgeolli was more like a staple food than alcohol, almost a necessity. Filtering and drinking makgeolli at home and planting leaf tobacco in a corner of the yard to smoke were common practices. Now, they are forced to buy tobacco at a price per cigarette and makgeolli at a price per cup, each with taxes attached. Isn't there a sense that this is premature for farmers who have not yet completely escaped the realm of primitive self-sufficiency? It seems these abrupt laws, coupled with the severity of the police, are reasons why more criminals are being created in Korea.

Good Results in Fine Collection

Since the conversation has strayed into irrelevant policy discussion, let's stop such talk and conclude with a couple of commonplace but worth-knowing points.

According to the Police Offences Punishment Rules (警察犯取締規則), minor offenses can be punished with fines (罰金) and minor fines (科料) collected by the police station, and the amounts reach a considerable sum. For the 5th year of Shōwa (1930), fines amounted to 514,639 yen from 21,869 Koreans, 11,755 yen from 434 Japanese, and 11,474 yen from 657 foreigners, totaling 583,868 yen from 22,968 people. Minor fines amounted to 256,043 yen 30 sen from 60,810 Koreans, 7,750 yen 50 sen from 2,018 Japanese, and 5,709 yen 50 sen from 741 foreigners. Combining fines and minor fines, it reaches a massive sum of 833,571 yen from 86,529 people. If policing were a business, it would be number one in Korea.

Furthermore, looking at the execution of physical punishments by the police: detention (拘留) involved 15,560 people, penal servitude for a definite term (有期懲役) 1,059 people, and imprisonment for a definite term (有期禁錮) 193 people, totaling 16,812 people. Excluding 300 Japanese and 71 foreigners, the remainder are all Koreans.

Control of Assemblies and Associations: Assemblies and associations of Koreans had been prohibited since Meiji 43 (1910), but thanks to Governor-General Saitō's (齋藤) Cultural Policy (文化政治), they were allowed freedom under the condition that they "do not disturb public peace" (公安을 妨害치 안는). However, due to reasons attached to that "disturbance of public peace," they are still subject to considerable restrictions. Expressed in numbers, assemblies held with permission numbered 5,490, with 520,197 participants, while those prohibited or restricted reached 1,040 cases.

480,000 People with Criminal Records (前科者): Anyone receiving a punishment equivalent to or greater than a fine is called a person with a criminal record (前科者). There is a considerable number of these individuals: in the 5th year of Shōwa (1930), there were 474,241 Koreans, 6,350 Japanese, and 1,939 Chinese, totaling 482,531 people. Once registered in the criminal record register (前科者名簿), a person's name remains there until death (unless they are fortunate enough to receive amnesty (赦) and have their rights restored (復權)).

**Summary**

This 1932 article by Kim Tongjin critiques the overwhelming power and pervasive presence of the police force in colonial Korea, arguing it constitutes "Police Politics." It details the police organization from the central Police Affairs Bureau down to local substations, noting the extensive administrative duties police undertake beyond traditional law enforcement, including roles in finance, industry promotion, and public works, often instilling fear. The article highlights the substantial budget (nearly 30 million yen), the large number of personnel (over 17,000, with a declining proportion of Korean officers in leadership roles), high arrest rates facilitated by strict regulations like the Police Offences Punishment Rules, and the significant revenue generated from fines. It also touches upon the suppression of assemblies and the large number of individuals (nearly half a million) with criminal records. For historians, this article is valuable for its contemporary perspective on the mechanisms of Japanese colonial control, emphasizing the police not just as enforcers but as key agents of administration and social engineering. The statistics on personnel demographics (Korean vs. Japanese), budget allocation, arrests, and the impact of specific laws (like the Monopoly and Forestry Edicts) provide concrete data points illustrating the nature and extent of police dominance and its social consequences.

朝鮮警察의 解剖 -年 3千萬圓의 用途檢察-, 行政全般에 關與 絶大한 力量 發揮
						金東進
植民地統治에 軍隊와 警察力이 絶大한 役割을 演함은 朝鮮만 아니겟지마는 朝鮮은 겨우 憲兵警察時代를 벗어나서 警察政治時代의 初期에든지 얼마가 되지 못하므로 朝鮮의 警察은 다른 데에 比하야 보다 많은 힘을 가지고 잇다.
「朝鮮은 警察政治」라고 부르는데 對하야 當局은 異議를 提唱하고 또 怒여워하기도 한다 마는 現下의 事實이 警察政治時代를 免치 못하얏다고 辯證할 幾多의 材料가 잇음에야 어쩔 수 없다. 例를 들면 筆者의 記憶에 남어 잇는 것만 하더라도
1. 警察犯取締規則이 一般으로 峻嚴한 것.
2. 留置 檢東期間이 長久한 것.
3. 警察署長의 檢事事務를 取扱하는 것.
4. 民事, 爭訟調停事務를 取扱하는 것.
5. 執達吏事務를 取扱하는 것.
6. 巡査(巡査部長이 아니라도)가 司法警察官事務를 보는 것.
7. 各種行政의 援助事務를 보는 것.
等이다. 朝鮮의 警察犯取締規則이라는 것은 日本內地의 「警察犯取締令」보다 峻嚴한 것은 贅論할 必要도 없겟거니와 檢束, 留置拘留期間의 長久는 警察의 最大한 武器다. 이 때문에 人民은 경찰관리의 비위를 마출려고 하게 하고 따라서 一部 철없는 警官의 自矜을 增長시키게되어 朝鮮은 「警察政治」라고 非難을 發하게 하는 重大한 理由가 되게 한다. 또 第7項의 「各種 行政의 援助事務」라는 것은 朝鮮은 交通, 民知, 行政機關의 發達程度 等이 모두 未及한 탓도 없지 않겟으나 警官은 道路修築, 林野保護, 國境地方의 關稅事務, 懲稅, 害蟲驅除, 漁業取締, 專賣令違反監視, 寄附行爲 等에는 勿論, 産業, 副業, 貯金의 獎勵에 까지 警察官이 關係한다. 이러한 行政官廳의 事務에 警官이 일일히 關係하니 이만 하면 「朝鮮은 警察政治」라 함에 무엇이 不足할까. 警察官은 郡廳의 財務係일도 보고 庶務係 事務도 보며 專賣局일 稅關事務 總督府 山林部일 殖産局 水産課 農務課일 遞信局일 內務局일 面長일 區長일 何如튼 모든 行政事務에 警察의 힘이 發動한다. 이와 같은 警察權의 發動은 그 本質에 잇어 干涉이 目的이 아니요 未備한 行政機關을 援助하기 爲함에 잇으나 權力가진 者의 援助的 容喙는 恒常 一方을 抑壓하는 缺陷을 伴하게 되나니 朝鮮警察의 行政援助事務도 總督統治에＜28＞ 有利한 點이 잇는 反面엔 民衆에 恐怖를 느끼게 하며 또 怨恨을 사는 傾向이 많다.

警察事務分掌과 各機關組織內容
그러면 이와 같은 絶大한 權限을 가진 警察機關의 組織은 어떠케 되엇으며 各 機關의 事務分掌은 어떠케 되어 잇을까? 警察署 우에 警察部가 잇고 警察部 우에 警務局이 잇으며 警察署밑에 駐在所, 出張所, 派出所가 잇다는 것은 누구나 다 아는 것이지마는 그 各 機關이 各其 어떤 事務를 맡어 보며 또 警察의 人員은 몇 名이며 警察費는 얼마나 되는가 하는 것은 一般常識問題로 興味잇는 것이겟으므로 가장 알기 쉽게 써보려고 한다.
最高機關으로 警務局이 잇다. 警務局에는 勅任官의 局長이 잇어 總督 總監의 令을 받어 全警察事務를 掌理한다. 警務局內의 組織은 局長밑에 警務, 保安, 圖書, 衛生의 4課로 노니어 잇고 또 警察官講習所가 따로이 設立되엇다. 各 課의 事務分掌을 보면
警務課 = 行政警察에 關한 事項, 警察區域 及 警察職員의 配置 及 服務에 關한 件, 警衛 及 警備에 關한 件, 警察의 被服 及 銃器彈藥 附屬品에 關한 事項, 警察官吏 及 消防官吏의 功勞記章에 關한 事項, 國境警備, 察警職員 及 遺族 一時金에 關한 事項, 兵事에 關한 件, 局內他課의 主管에 屬치 않은 事.
保安課 = 高等警察에 關한 事項, 勞働者募集에 關한 事項, 外事警察에 關한 事項.
圖書課 = 新聞紙, 雜誌 及 出版物에 關한 事項, 著作權에 關한 事項, 檢閱한 新聞紙, 雜誌 及 出版物 保有에 關한 事項, 活動寫眞檢閱에 關한 事項.
衛生課 = 公衆衛生에 關한 全般事務, 醫師, 醫生, 藥劑士, 看護婦, 助産婦, 賣藥業者에 대한 任免 及 取締, 墓地에 關한 것.
警察官講習所 = 日本人巡査敎習 及 警部以下 一般警察官 講習.
各 道에는 道知事 밑에 警察部長이 잇고 그 밑에 警務, 高等, 保安, 衛生, 刑事(京畿道에만) 等 各 課로 노니어 잇다. 事務의 分掌은 警務局과 大差가 없으나 警務局 保安課의 事務를 高等課에서 分掌하얏고 道 保安課는 道 高等課의 所屬이 아닌 保安警察과 消防事務와 司法警察의 事務만 全擔한다. 그러나 京畿道에만 刑事課가 設置되어 잇어 各 道의 司法警察事務와 全朝鮮 犯罪者 科學搜索指紋蒐集의 總本部가 되어 잇다. 또 各道에 巡査敎習所가 잇으니 이는 오로지 朝鮮人 警察官 敎習養成機關이다.
警察署의 事務分擔은 警察部와 마찬가지로 警務, 高等, 司法, 衛生, 保安의 5係로 노니엇다. 高等係는 各 署마다 設置되어 잇기는 하나 高等警察事務가 閒散한 署는 그 主任을 高級署僚 또는 署長이 兼務하는 例도 잇다. 警察署 밑에 駐在所, 派出所, 出張所가 잇다. 駐在所는 警察署所在地 外의 面 所在地 또는 重要鄕村에 設置하고 派出所는 警察署 所在地 內의 重要地點에 設置하며 出張所는 國境警備를 爲하야 또는 緊急한 事情으로 臨時로 設置하는 것이다. 이밖에 巡査見張所라는 것이 어떤 都市에 臨時로 設置되기로 하얏섯으나 지금은 大槪 撤廢되엇다. 駐在所와 出張所는 司法警察官 事務를 보는 權限이 復興되어 잇으되 派出所巡査는 이 權限의 行使를 制限하얏다.
警察의 組織은 以上과 같다. 各道 警察行政은
朝鮮總督府 地方官制 第13條에
警察部長은 警察 及 衛生事務의 執行에 關하야 知事의 命을 承하야 部下의 警視警部, 警部補, 巡査 及 消防手를 指揮監督함.
에 依하야 知事의 權限이되 朝鮮總督府 委任事項 規定 第8條에 「警務局長은 左의 事項을 專行함」이라는 條文 밑에 萬般警察에 對한 指揮監督權이 委任되엇다.
地方官制 第13條에 依하야 知事에게도＜29＞ 權限이 附與되어 잇으므로 指揮命令을 任意로 할 수 잇게 되엇으되 實際 警察事務는 오로지 總督府 委任事項 第8條에 依하야 警務局長의 權限으로 되어 잇다. 이 때문에 兩者의 關係가 微妙하야 어떤 때에는 우수운 事態를 演出하기도 하니 一例를 들면 忠南知事이든 劉鎭淳 氏가 進廳 移轉事件 當時의 騷動의 責任을 지고 桂冠한 것같은 것이다. 知事가 警察權을 가진 것은 法文의 保障된 바이로되 知事의 種類에 따라 좀처럼 容喙를 못하는 것이 當例이다. 그러나 그 責任은 지어야 되는 法이다. 또 이 一例로는 平南知事이든 園田 氏가 中國人에 대한 暴行事件으로 退職(반듯이 이 理由뿐만은 아니지만)한 것 같은 것도 잇다.
警備施設은 1府郡에 1警察署를 設置하는 것이 原則으로 되어 잇으나 地方의 事情에 依하야 2警察署 以上도 잇다. 最近 現在 警察署 數爻는 251個 所로 府郡島 數를 超越하기 19個所이다. 駐在所 數爻는 2千299個所이요 派出所는 183個所이며, 出張所는 138個所이다. 이밖에 警備船으로 汽船5隻, 發動機船 16隻이 잇고 警備 電話線이 延長 2千576里30町에 達하야 13道中 咸北, 全南을 除하고는 全部 直接 警務局과 通話를 할 수 잇게 되엇다. 警備 電話線 延長 2千5766餘里는 公衆電話線 646里보다 約4배에 達한다.
이밖에 自動車 及 自動自轉車가 50臺에 達하여 馬匹이 70餘頭 (中略) 이밖에 寫眞機, 指紋器가 各署에 1個 또는 2個가 設備되엇으니 威容이 堂堂하다.

朝鮮人幹部漸滅
警察官의 數爻는 定員은 1萬8千7百餘人이나 現員은 1萬7千726人이다. 이것을 區分하면 警察部長 13人, 警視 日本人 47人, 朝鮮人 8人, 警部 日本人 330人, 朝鮮人 716人, 警部補 日本人 558人, 朝鮮人 118人, 巡査部長 日本人 2千751人, 朝鮮人 312人, 巡査 日本人 7千72人, 朝鮮人 6千443人, 計 日本人 1萬769人, 朝鮮人 6千957人이다.
大正8年 警察制度改正直後와 現在의 警察現員增減을 보면 朝鮮人은 巡査만 除하고는 全部가 減少하고 日本人은 全部가 增加하얏는데 특히 눈에 띄우는 것은 警視 警部 警部補 等 朝鮮人幹部 警官이 顯著히 減少한 것이다.
警察費는 昭和5年度豫算이 2千912萬5千308圓이다. 其中 重要한 支出이 俸給인데 昭和6年度 俸給을 一瞥하면
警察部長 6萬2千972圓 警視 13萬1千360圓 警部 59萬7千6百圓 警部補 67萬9千698圓 巡査 1千222萬7千544圓 合計 1千371萬9千174圓이다. 其中 朝鮮人 所得은 436萬餘圓에 不過하다.
俸給外의 重要한 支出은 事務費이다. 이中에 눈에 띄우는 項目은 銃器 百50種, 新調費 2萬2千7百圓, 巡査刀 2百挺, 新調費 千8百圓, 銃器補修費 2千7百圓, 彈藥費 7千圓 等이 잇다. 그리고 巡査被服費는 1人衣 平均15圓60錢이며 私服巡査에 給與하는 被服費는 316圓50錢탁이다. 요새 늘어가는 刑事에게 주는 刑事手當은 4萬圓이다.
留置場費用 及 犯人逮捕 檀¡ 警官出張費用 犯人押送隊費는 얼마나 드는가 하면 豫算總額이 56萬8千605圓이다. 이 豫算은 留置場에서 밥 얻어먹을 사람의 延人數를 72萬9千1百23人으로 잡고 1人 1日 平均食費 27錢과 이 合計 19萬6千864圓하고 嫌疑者 及 犯人押送巡査 及 犯人旅費, 食費, 留置場 器具費, 雜費 等을 計算한 것이다. 사람 잡고 잡히고 하는데 57萬圓돈이 든다. (中略)

犯罪檢擧23萬
警察에 檢擧되는 사람은 몇 名이나 될가. 一時檢束까지 合하면 몇 10萬名에 達할른지 모르되 統計年報에 依하면 昭和4年에 犯罪檢擧狀況이 ＜30＞ 件數 23萬5千608件, 人員 27萬9千573人이나 朝鮮人口에 比하면 70分之1, 卽 70人 中 1人이 犯罪嫌疑 또는 犯罪로 警察에 檢擧를 當한 세음이다.
前述한 바와 같이 朝鮮은 法規가 넘어 仔詳하고 峻嚴하기 때문에 警察에 붙들리는 사람이 많다는 證例로 警察署에서 檢事局에 送致한 犯罪被疑者 中 起訴되는 사람의 數爻가 적다는 것을 들 수 잇다. 卽 昭和5年의 統計에 檢事局 受理事件 12萬4千356件에 19萬380人 中, 그 해에 處理된 事件이 12萬3千585件 18萬8千708人인데, 이 處理結果가 檢事起訴는 不過 4萬6千915件에 5萬4千289人이오 餘他는 起訴中止, 不起訴, 起訴猶豫, 無罪 等으로 釋放된 것을 보아 이 方面의 消息을 大槪 斟酌할 수 잇지 않을가?
警察犯取締規則과 諸般人權을 尊重히 하지 않은 法令의 改正이 時急함은 呶呶히 主唱할 必要도 없겟거니와 이 規則 外의 各種 法令 中에도 朝鮮의 民度의 適當치 않은 者가 많다. 一例를 들면 森林令 專賣令 等이니 數年來 이 法令의 施行을 勵行한 結果 犯罪者가 激增하야 大正 13年엔 特別 法犯 件數가 1萬5千960件에 不過하든 것이 同5年에는 3萬9千894件에 達하얏다. 自古로 窮僻한 農村의 滿足치 못한 農民은 막걸리와 葉草 때문에 消費하는 金額이 別로 없엇다. 더욱 막걸리는 술이라기보다는 一種의 食糧이라고 할 수 잇는 必需品이나 다름없다. 이례히 막걸리 걸러 마시고 뜰 앞 한 모퉁이에 葉草심어 피우든 것이 지금은 담배한대 얼마 막걸리 한 잔에 몇 厘式의 稅金붙은 것을 꼭꼭 사서 먹게 만들엇으니 아직 原始的 自作自給의 境域을 完全히 超脫치 못한 農民에겐 時期尙早의 慊이 없지 않을가? 이런 急激한 法令이 警察의 峻嚴과 아울러 朝鮮에 犯罪者를 보다 많이 만들게 하는 理由가 되는가 한다.

罰金懲收好成績
말이 엉뚱한 政策論으로 버드러 젓으니 이런 이야기는 그만두고 平凡한 中에 알어둘 만한 이야기 두어 마디로 맺어버리자.
警察犯取締規則에 依하야 些少한 罪過는 警察署에서 罰金과 科料를 懲收할 수 잇는데 그 金額이 相當한 巨額에 達한다. 昭和 5年 分 罰金이 朝鮮人 2萬1千869人에 金額이 514萬639圓, 日本人 434人에 1萬1千755圓, 外國人 657人에 1萬1千474圓, 都合 2萬2千968人에 58萬3千868圓이요 科料는 朝鮮人 6萬810人에 25萬6千43圓30錢, 日本人 2千18人에 7千750圓50錢, 外國人 741人에 5千709圓50錢이니 罰金과 過料를 合하면 8萬6千529人에 83萬3千571圓이라는 莫大한 金額에 達하야 警察도 장사라 하면 朝鮮서는 넘버원이다.
또 警察의 體刑執行 狀況은 拘留가 1萬5千560人, 有期懲役이 1千59人, 有期禁錮가 193人, 都合 1萬6千812人이다. 이 數字는 日本人 3百人 中 國人 71人을 除하고 남어지는 全部 朝鮮人이다.
集會結社의 團束 朝鮮人의 集會結社는 明治 43年以來 禁止狀態에 잇든 것을 齋藤氏의 文化政治 德에 「公安을 妨害치 안는」 條件付로 自由로 하게 되엇다. 그러나 그 「公安妨害」가 까닭이 붙어 아직도 非常한 制限을 받고 잇으니 이것을 數字로 表示하면 許可를 얻어 開催된 集會가 5千490, 參加한 人員이 52萬197人, 禁止 或은 制限을 當한 것이 1千40件에 達한다.
前科者48萬  罰金以上의 刑을 받으면 前科者라고 한다. 이 前科者가 相當히 많어 昭和5年에 朝鮮人 47萬4千241人, 日本人 6千350人, 中國人 1千939人, 都合 48萬2千531人이다. 前科者는 前科者名簿가 잇어 한번 登錄만 되면 죽도록 이름이 그 名簿에서 사라지지 안는다.(赦를 입어 復權되면 多幸이지만) (終) ＜31＞
