Song of Condolence and Consolation for Compatriots in Manchuria
						Lyrics by Yi Ŭn-sang

1. When you left your warm hometown,
There was no one to wipe away those tears, those tears.
There, there to that wind-swept place,
My siblings who went, unable to do otherwise.

2. Looking toward the far distant hometown sky, weeping,
I can see your crying form, I see it in my eyes.
There, there in those rough fields,
My siblings wandering, afflicted with endemic disease (장기).

3. Old folks and children huddled together, this way and that,
Upon those wandering bodies, what is this? Why is this?
While experiencing all manner of hardships,
Have you also met an unintended death?

4. O siblings wandering in the snow, receive comfort!
Even you distant spirits, please listen, receive comfort!
When the bright, bright new future arrives,
We will gather together and sing a new song. <1>

**Summary**

This poem, "Song of Condolence and Consolation for Compatriots in Manchuria," by Yi Ŭn-sang, laments the suffering of Korean migrants in Manchuria during the Japanese colonial period. It describes their sorrowful departure from home, the harsh conditions, disease, and death they faced while wandering in a foreign land. Despite the deep sympathy and sorrow expressed, the poem concludes with a message of hope, offering comfort and envisioning a future reunion where they will sing a "new song." From a historical perspective, the poem is significant as it reflects the difficult reality of Korean displacement and hardship in Manchuria, a major destination for emigrants escaping colonial oppression and poverty, particularly poignant given the timing shortly after the Wanpaoshan Incident (1931) and the Mukden Incident (1931) which worsened conditions for Koreans there. It captures the sense of loss, struggle, and longing for a better future shared by many Koreans during this era.

在滿同胞吊慰歌
						李殷相 作詞
1. 따뜻한 내고향을 떠나서 가실 적에
그 눈물 씻어줄 이 없엇네 그 눈물을
거기거기 그 바람찬데로
어이못해 찾아간 내형제

2. 멀고먼 고향하늘 바라고 눈물지며
우시는 그 모양이 보이네 눈에 뵈네
거기거기 그 거츨은 들에
장기쥐고 헤메는 내형제

3. 늙은이 어린이들 몰려서 이리저리
떠도는 그 몸우에 웬일고 어인일고
가진고초 다 맛보는 데서
뜻도 아닌 죽엄 또 일웟나

4. 눈속에 방황하는 형제여 위로받소
멀리간 넑이라도 들으소 위로받소
밝고밝은 새 앞날이 올 때
함께모여 새노래 부르리 ＜1＞
