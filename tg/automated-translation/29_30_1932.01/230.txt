**Summary**

This document provides the metadata for a cartoon titled "Various Types of Musicians" (音樂家千態) by Kim Hyŏngjun (金亨俊), published in the 30th issue of the magazine *Tonggwang* (東光) on January 25, 1932. As only the title and metadata are available, the content of the cartoon itself is unknown, but it likely satirizes or depicts different kinds of musicians prevalent in Korea at the time. For historians, this entry is interesting as it documents a piece of visual culture (a cartoon) from a colonial Korean magazine, offering potential insights into contemporary social commentary, artistic styles, and perceptions of musicians during that period, even without the visual content itself. The name Kim Inje (金仁堤) also appears, possibly indicating another contributor or related individual.
