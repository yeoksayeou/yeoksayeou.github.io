Woodpecker
						Yu Kŭn-sŏk

Woodpecker, Woodpecker
Hateful Woodpecker
Do not peck
The old tree's decaying leg.

When the winter wind, the strong wind
Blows,
Our Ancestors (先祖) carefully planted
Precious tree will break. <51>

**Summary**

This short poem by Yu Kŭn-sŏk uses the image of a woodpecker pecking at an old tree. The speaker implores the "hateful" woodpecker to stop damaging the tree's "decaying leg," warning that the strong winter wind will break the precious tree planted by their ancestors. From the perspective of colonial history, the poem can be read allegorically. The old, vulnerable tree might symbolize Korea itself, or its traditions, weakened and under threat. The woodpecker could represent destructive forces, potentially Japanese colonialism or internal factors, further harming the nation. The fear of the tree breaking in the harsh "winter wind" reflects deep anxiety about the nation's survival and the potential loss of heritage under oppressive circumstances.
