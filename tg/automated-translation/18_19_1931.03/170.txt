Wŏnsan Lussi Girls' High Common School Song

One. Behind the high and lovely Changbaek Mountain range stretching out,
Praying for long and distant blessings,
Facing the clear and deep Tongmyŏng waters before us,
Opening up a wide and great path ahead.
The building soaring high into the mid-air
Is Lussi High Common School.
Eternally and forever, our Lussi Girls' School,
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah forever!

Two. Cultivating virtue (德性), the foundation of conduct,
To create persons of noble character,
Developing knowledge that will become the blood of civilization,
So that the light of the Peninsula may shine.
Within the splendid Mugunghwa flower garden,
It produces flower-like daughters.
Eternally and forever, our Lussi Girls' School,
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah forever!

Three. Shouldering the responsibility of wise mothers and good wives (賢母良妻),
To build harmonious homes,
Widely spreading the principle of brotherly love (博愛),
To build a new heaven and a new earth.
Regardless, striving with effort,
We shall achieve our intended hope.
Eternally and forever, our Lussi Girls' School,
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah forever!<67>

**Summary**

This is the school song for the Wŏnsan Lussi Girls' High Common School, published in 1931. The lyrics praise the school's location, situated symbolically between the Changbaek Mountains and the Tongmyŏng waters (East Sea). The song outlines the school's educational goals: cultivating virtue and knowledge in its students, aiming for them to become the "light of the Peninsula" and responsible "wise mothers and good wives," while also promoting broader ideals like brotherly love and building a "new heaven and new earth." For historians, this text provides insight into the educational philosophy for Korean women during the colonial era, particularly within a likely missionary context (indicated by Lussi/Louise and themes like 'brotherly love' and 'new heaven and new earth'). It highlights the blend of modern education aspirations with traditional gender roles and patriotic sentiment framed within the confines of the period.

元山樓氏女高普 校歌
一. 높고 고운 장백산 뒤에 느러서
길고 먼 복락 빌어주며
맑고 깊은 동명물 앞에 림하야
넓고 큰 앞길 열어준다.
반공중에 우뚝 솟아 잇는 집은
루씨고등보통학교라.
영원무궁히 우리 루씨녀학교
만세 만세 만만세로다.

二. 행실의 근본된 덕성 함양하야
고상한 인물 만들으며
문명의 피되일 지식 발달하야
반도의 빛이 빛이도록
무궁화 꽃동산 화려한 그 속에
꽃답은 딸을 산출하다.
영원무궁히 우리 루씨녀학교
만세 만세 만만세로다.

三. 현모량처의 책임 메어서
화락한 가정이루며
박애의 주의를 넓리 전파하야
새하늘 새땅 건설하게
하여튼 무릅쓰고 노력하여서
목적한 희망 이루리라.
영원무궁히 우리 루씨녀학교
만세 만세 만만세로다.＜67＞
