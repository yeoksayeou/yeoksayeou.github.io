Apology Notice

One. We intended to publish this month's issue as a special edition focused on the School Strike Problem (盟休問題 특집), filled with substantial content. However, due to entirely unexpected and unavoidable circumstances, we were unable to include the majority of the manuscripts and have thus published this temporary issue (臨時號).

One. We cannot express how deeply sorry we are to all those who sacrificed their valuable time to provide us with their precious manuscripts (옥고). Furthermore, we offer a hundred apologies (百拜謝罪) to our readers for the reduced content.

One. Originally, Donggwang (東光) established a policy to publish before the monthly publication date, and all our members have been exerting their utmost effort, which we believe our readers understand. Although preparations for this month's issue began diligently early on, its publication has been delayed like this due to unspeakable circumstances. We gratefully accept the letters of encouragement received from various places. As time has already passed and preparing again would cause a further delay of about ten days, we are publishing this temporary issue. We plan to publish next month's issue specifically as a "Special Issue on the Rural Problem" (農村問題特輯), like a special enlarged edition (特大號). We sincerely hope (伏望) that readers everywhere will understand (諒察) our difficulties.

One. We feel particularly apologetic sending this issue to our subscribers who paid in advance (先金). We ask for your patience and hope you will wait for next month's issue.

One. Barring any further particular trouble, we plan to definitely release (出世) next month's issue around March 20th. Please understand (下諒하시옵소서).

One. As you are well aware of the circumstances of the Korean (朝鮮) magazine world, which pushes forward through layers upon layers of difficulties—manuscript shortages (原稿難), financial difficulties (財政難), and especially censorship difficulties (檢閱難)—we trust you will receive this temporary issue with deep sympathy and we promise a better future.

**Summary**

The Donggwang Society apologizes profusely for the delay and reduced content of the March 1931 issue (No. 19), released as a "temporary issue." They explain that an intended special feature on "School Strikes" had to be largely scrapped due to unspecified "unavoidable" and "unspeakable" circumstances. They promise a special enlarged issue on the "Rural Problem" for April, aiming for a March 20th release. The apology explicitly lists manuscript shortages, financial struggles, and notably, "censorship difficulties" (檢閱難) as major challenges faced by Korean magazines at the time. The direct mention of censorship and the cancellation of the potentially sensitive "School Strike" feature are highly revealing of the restrictive publishing environment under Japanese colonial rule. This notice offers historians insight into the operational pressures and political constraints faced by Korean publications in the early 1930s.
