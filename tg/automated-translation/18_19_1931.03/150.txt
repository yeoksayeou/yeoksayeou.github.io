**Body Text Translation**

Snowy Night
						Cho Chong-hyŏn

1
Older brother, farewell.
Cross this river gently.
Before the house lights are lit
And before the sleeping dog barks,
May you cross safely;
I shall watch you go.

2
No matter how resentful,
Though you spew boiling blood
And depart on this path,
Though you cross even this river,
As if this night itself knows why,
Sorrow comes first.

3
The snow falling tenderly,
As soon as it lands, I will gather it
And follow my departed brother's steps,
Filling them in along the way.
I pray, may the hidden traces
Be gently buried.

On the bank of the XX River in the North Country (北國) <53>

**Summary**

This poem, written in the traditional sijo form, depicts a sorrowful farewell on a snowy night. The speaker watches their "older brother" (likely a term of respect for a compatriot or loved one) secretly crossing a river, expressing deep sadness and concern for his safety. The speaker vows to cover the brother's footprints with snow, emphasizing the need for secrecy. The mention of resentment ("boiling blood") and the clandestine departure, coupled with the final censored location ("XX Riverbank in the North Country"), strongly suggests an escape or flight, possibly for political reasons, common during the Japanese colonial period. Historians might find the poem valuable for its portrayal of suppressed emotions, the theme of forced departure or exile common among Koreans resisting or fleeing colonial rule, and the evidence of censorship (the "XX") regarding sensitive locations like border crossings.

눈오시는 밤
						趙宗玄
1
옵바여 잘 가시다.
이 강 살작 건느시다.
잠이 집 불이 일고
잠든 개도 짖기 전에
무사히 건느시옴을
제가 보고 가오리.

2
아무리 울분하여
끓는 피를 뿜으시며
이 길을 뜨시오나
이 강마자 건느시나
이내 밤 어이램인 듯
슬픔부터 앞서네.

3
정답게 나리는 눈
오신 족족 받아다가
떠가신 옵바 거름
따라가며 메워주리.
빕노니 숨어간 자최
고이 묻어 주소서.
