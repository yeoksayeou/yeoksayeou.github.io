Song of an Old Peasant, Upon Reading Ansŏ's Critical Review of the Translation
						Chonghan

The old father, alone, worn out by poverty,
Cultivating a slash-and-burn field of three days' ploughing, planting seeds, weeding, enduring all hardships,
In this life of mine with absolutely nothing to harvest,
Only the taxes remain unchanged—nothing to eat.

Behold! Squeezing our blood and sweat
To fill their warehouses—
This year too draws to a close, the frosty wind bites the flesh,
In the empty room with nothing to eat, only the chilly wind assaults!

Thus, we clutch our threadbare cotton clothes,
Climb the back hill, and gather acorns.
From within the boat floating mid-river,
When a strain of a drinking song drifts on the wind,
I wish to gently press my pounding heart.
The lives of the Master Kims (김생들) kept on the boat,
I clearly realized, are better than ours.

Original Poem
An old man, poor, lives in the mountains; his seedlings are sparse, taxes heavy, he cannot get food.
He ploughs and plants three or four *mou* on the south mountain; what is harvested enters the government granary to serve the officials.
Year's end, his hoe and plough lean in the empty room; west river merchant guests buy pearls by the white *hu*.
He calls his son to climb the mountain and gather acorns; the dogs kept on the boat are constantly fed meat. -(Chang Chi)-<95>

**Summary**

This work by Chonghan is a poem written in response to reading a critical review by someone named Ansŏ concerning a translation of the classic Chinese poem "Song of an Old Peasant" (野老歌) by the Tang poet Chang Chi (Zhang Ji). Chonghan's poem vividly portrays the extreme poverty and suffering of a Korean peasant farmer, burdened by heavy taxes despite having almost nothing to harvest from his meager slash-and-burn field. The poem contrasts the farmer's destitution – gathering acorns in the cold – with the implied comfort and indifference of the wealthy or powerful ("Master Kims" on a boat, officials whose granaries are filled by the farmer's labor). For historians, the poem is significant as it reflects the harsh realities faced by many Korean farmers during the colonial period, particularly the burdens of taxation and the stark socio-economic disparities, using the framework of a traditional East Asian theme of peasant suffering to voice contemporary grievances.

野老歌, 岸曙의 譯詩評論을 읽고
						종한
늙은 아비 홀로 가난에 지처
사흘가리 화전이나마 씨뿌리고 김매고 가진고초로
추수할곳 바이없는 이내 신세에
납세만은 여전히 -먹을것없네

보라 우리들의 피땀을 짜내어
그네들의 倉庫의 채옴을-
이해도 저물어 서리바람 살쩜을 어이는데
먹을 것 없는 빈방안에 쌀쌀한 바람만 掩襲하는고녀

우리들은 이리하야 헐벗은 무명옷을 부등케쥐고
뒤동산에 올라 도토리를 줏는 것이옵네
江中의 뜨노는 배(船)안에서
勸酒歌 一曲이 바람에 쓰처올 때
피방아찌는 가삼을 살못이 눌리고저
배안에 기르는 김생들의 생활도
우리보다 나은 것을 똑똑히 알엇내

原詩
老翁家貧在山住 苗踈稅多不得食
耕種南山三四畝 輸入官倉仕爲士
歲暮鉏犁倚空室 西江買客珠白斛
