Miscellaneous Poems on Mountain Life
						By T'aebaek Sanin

The valueless grass is my friend day in and day out on the mountain.
Smoke from the willow forest thickens, obscuring the mountain entrance.
Is there any way for the breathless wind of the dusty world (塵世) to enter?

As night falls outside the window, I sit alone.
Paulownia leaves rustle, *ttudak ttudak*; frogs croak, *gaegol gaegol*.
The whole world is clamorous, yet my heart grows calmer.

I dig up chrysanthemums below the fence, planting them clump by clump.
On this morning after the rain, even the smell of the earth is fragrant.
Having wandered for 10 years, I think, am I back in the mountains again? <99>

**Summary**

This three-stanza poem by "T'aebaek Sanin" (Man of T'aebaek Mountain) expresses the tranquility and contentment found in a secluded mountain life. The speaker finds companionship in nature, feels protected from the turmoil of the secular world ("dusty world"), and experiences heightened inner peace amidst the natural sounds of the night. The final stanza reflects on returning to this peaceful existence after a decade of wandering, finding solace in simple acts like gardening. From a historical perspective, during the Japanese colonial period (1910-1945), works celebrating withdrawal into nature could sometimes signify a retreat from the oppressive political and social reality, a yearning for a purer, perhaps implicitly more 'Korean', space away from colonial modernity and control. Historians might find it interesting as an example of escapist or quietist literature during a time of national hardship, reflecting a personal search for peace rather than overt resistance.

山居雜詠
						太白山人
갑없는 풀은山이 지나새나 벗이로다
버들숲 연기짙어 산어구를 가리웟네
塵世의 숨찬바람이야 드릴길이 잇으랴.

창밖에 밤이 올제 외로이 앉엇으니
오동닢 뚜닥뚜닥 개고리 개골개골
왼누리 요란하오니 마음더욱 고요해

울밑에 국화캐여 포기포기 심노매라
비개인 이 아츰엔 흙냄새도 향긔롭네
10년간 나돌든 이몸 다시산가 하노라. ＜99＞
