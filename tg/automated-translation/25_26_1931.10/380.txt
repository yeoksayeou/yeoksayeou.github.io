A Sorrowful Memory
						Cho Chong-hyŏn

Did I want to leave? It just came to be that I left.
Did I mean to send you away? It just came to be that you were sent away.
That is just how things became for the two of us then.

When my feet couldn't bear to turn away quickly,
As if forcing my gaze, I lingered, speaking,
Then laughed, facing the old man who handed me a cane.

Saying goodbye, then calling back to speak again,
Finishing the words, turning away, then both turning back to look,
It seemed as though we stood still, as though wanting to go together.

Even having said all I had to say, words still remained,
Would it be the same for that person? It must surely be the same.
How could the hearts of the two of us possibly be different?
- From "The Moon Setting on Samsan" - <99>

**Summary**

This poem by Cho Chong-hyŏn captures the lingering sorrow and reluctance of a parting between two individuals. It emphasizes the feeling that the separation wasn't truly desired by either party but was something that simply "came to be." The poem details the hesitant actions and unspoken emotions during the farewell, highlighting the mutual longing and the difficulty of leaving, suggesting their hearts remained connected despite the physical separation. From a historical perspective, the poem reflects personal sentiments of loss and separation, common themes in literature from the colonial period, potentially mirroring broader feelings of displacement or constrained circumstances, though expressed on an intimate scale. The use of older Korean orthography and grammar is also of linguistic interest.

애닯은 추억
						趙宗玄
떠나고 싶어가나 떠나게만 되온 것이
보내자 보낸것가 보내게만 되온것이
그때에 두리의 일이 그러케만 되더라

발길이 참아 얼른 안도리케 못갈적에
눈길을 걱제한 듯 어정거려 말을하다
지팽이 주는 영감을 마조보고 웃엇소

가라고 하여놓고 다시불러 말이르고
말맺고 도라서다 두리마조 돌아볼제
선자리 선것같어여 가자는 것 갓더라

내 할말 다햇다도 말 그대로 남은 것이
그이도 그럴것가 그도 역시 그럴것이
어이타 두리마음이 다를줄이 잇으리
-「三山에 지는 달」중에서-＜99＞
