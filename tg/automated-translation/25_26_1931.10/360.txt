Author: 失名氏 (Anonymous)
Article Type: 시 (Poem)

As night falls on the Kŭm River, the silvery waves and misty moon are even more beautiful.
In this heaven-gifted scenic spot, fleeting human life seems so distant.
Playing a t'ungso pipe under the moon, I try to connect my myriad sorrows.

The Milky Way marks the third watch, white dew blankets the river—a magnificent sight!
That child herding oxen says his clothes are getting wet.
Never mind, shall we stay awake all through this fine night in this famed place?

Oh, bird crying on the peak, please tell me your name.
This is not the Night of Red Cliff (赤壁夜), so a black-robed lone crane (玄裳孤鶴) would not come.
Perhaps it is the cuckoo (杜鵑), a bird of eternal lament?

I too have left my beloved and wander seeking rivers and mountains.
The sound of crying for a loved one cannot be heard by one whose heart burns within.
Since your plight is like mine, how about gazing at the moon and getting thoroughly drunk?

The sound of the stone chime from Yŏngŭn Temple (靈隱寺) comes from beyond the clouds.
Wine cups and plates lie scattered; does this mean the east is brightening?
Set the boat adrift midstream (中流); let it go where it may.

Impromptu (卽事)
As the rain stops on the paulownia branch, the cicadas' cries are clamorous.
Where has the shepherd boy gone? Only the bullock leaps about alone.
A rooster crows beneath the fence; is it already noon (午天)?<98>

**Summary**

This work consists of two poems. The main poem, "Moonlit Night on the Kŭm River," describes a contemplative, melancholic night spent by the Kŭm River. The speaker reflects on the beauty of nature, the fleetingness of life, personal sorrow (separation from a loved one), and seeks solace through music, camaraderie with nature (a crying bird), and wine, eventually drifting aimlessly. The short second poem, "Impromptu," captures a brief, vivid scene of summer after rain. From a historical perspective, the poems offer insight into the sentiments of an individual during the Japanese colonial period. The themes of sorrow, wandering, seeking refuge in nature and drink, and a sense of aimlessness might reflect the broader atmosphere of displacement, loss, or suppressed feelings under colonial rule, making nature a seemingly apolitical space for expressing personal grief.

錦江月夜
						失名氏
금강에 밤이 드니 은파연월 더욱조에
천재명구에 부유인생 아득코나
월하에 퉁소를 불어 萬重恨을 잇노라

은하는 三更인대 白露橫江 壯觀일다
소모는 저 아니는 옷 젓는다 말을 하네
두어라 名區良夜를 새고갈가 하노라

봉우에 우난새야 이름이나 알려다고
赤壁夜 아니여든 玄裳孤鶴 올리없고
아마도 萬古冤禽인 두견인가 하노라

나또한 임여히고 강산차자 노노매라
임그려 우는 소리 속탄사람 못듣것다
네사정 날과같으니 玩月長醉 어떠리

靈隱寺 磬쇠소리 구름밖에 나는구나
배반이 낭자하니 동방이 밝단말가
中流에 배띠여라 가는대로 가리라

卽事
梧枝에 비그치니 매미소리 낭자코나
牧兒는 어대간고 부룩지만 혼자뛰네
籬下에 달기우르니 午天인가 하노라.＜98＞
