Five Poems for Passing Time (Rhymed)

Five Poems for Passing Time (Rhymed)
A single north star shining in the dark night,
You are that star, rising every night.
If the day is cloudy, you are colorless still,
But as you are the day, I am glad. You illuminate this heart.

Master Key
Your heart, my love, is a lock; there's no way to know it.
Turn east, and a pirate laughs from the west;
Strike south, and a sigh is breathed from the north.
This body is a master key holder, opening it daily.

Humming by the Han River Bridge
The lamps shine on the water as they did before,
But the person by the bridge pier is nowhere to be found.
When thoughts of the past summer night arise anew,
Only the cold wind from Bunae permeates the body.

Wind
My heart is clouded, sir/madam,
Black clouds cover it without cease.
Oh wind, please blow, please clear it.
I long for the distinct, bright sun, sir/madam.

Butterfly
Butterflies gather and play in the flower garden.
They fly about from this flower to that flower.
This fate is a butterfly; in my beloved's garden,
This heart wanders, following the flowers. <94>

**Summary**

This collection consists of five short, rhymed poems by Kim Ansŏ. The poems explore themes of longing, searching, love, nature, and melancholy. The speaker observes a guiding star, attempts to understand a lover's complex heart likened to a lock, reminisces sadly by the Han River Bridge, expresses a desire for clarity amidst inner turmoil symbolized by clouds and wind, and compares their wandering heart to a butterfly seeking flowers in a beloved's garden. From a historical perspective, these poems, published during the Japanese colonial period, offer insight into personal sentiments expressed through lyrical verse. While overtly personal, the themes of longing for light (guidance, clarity, the sun) and navigating complex, sometimes resistant, environments (the lock-like heart, the cloudy mind) could potentially be interpreted by historians as subtle reflections of the era's atmosphere of constraint and yearning for liberation or understanding, expressed within the bounds of acceptable publication.

消遺五首
						金岸曙
消遣五首(押韻)
어둔밤에 빛나는 북쪽 별하나
그대는 별이오라, 밤마다 뜨네.
날흐리면 그대로 빛깔없으나
날개이니 반갑다. 이맘비최네.

열대
님의맘은 잠을쇠, 알길이 없네.
동을돌면 서에서 해적이 웃고
남을치면 북에서 한숨을 쉬네.
이몸은 열대잡이, 날마다 여네.

漢江橋邊低唱
등뿔은 예전대로 물에 빛나니
다리까에 사람은 간 곧이 없네.
지내간 녀름밤의 생각새른제,
부나내 찬바람뿐, 몸에 숨이네

바람
바늘은 이내마음 흐렷사외다,
검은구름 끈잖고 덮여돕니다.
바람아, 불어주게, 맑혀를다구.
뚜럿한 밝은해가 그립사외다.

나비
나비들은 꽃밭에 뫃여놉니다.
이꽃에서 저꽃을 날며돕니다.
이신세 나비외다, 님의동산을
이맘은 꽃을딸아 헤매돕니다.＜94＞
