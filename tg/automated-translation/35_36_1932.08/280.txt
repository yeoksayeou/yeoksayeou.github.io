Flood Damage
						Chŏn Sik

Last night, it rained all night long,
The sound of water comes from the fields.
The rain hasn't stopped yet,
But the sound of water is loud.
Perhaps the dike (동) has burst again.
The one that burst last autumn,
We worked this spring to block it,
But that blasted dike must have burst again.

Damn it, trying to make a living farming like this!
With so much effort, we finished all the weeding,
But again, there's flood damage, again the dike bursts,
There’s never a peaceful day.
Eldest son, grab the shovel (산지)!
Let’s hurry out to the paddy field. <83>

**Summary**

This poem expresses the despair and weariness of a Korean farmer facing recurrent flood damage. After enduring heavy rain, the farmer hears the sound of flooding and realizes the dike, painstakingly repaired after breaking the previous year, has burst again, ruining the recently weeded fields. The poem ends with a resigned but urgent call to his son to grab a shovel and head out to the fields, highlighting the relentless cycle of labor and disaster. From a historical perspective, the poem offers a glimpse into the hardships faced by Korean farmers during the colonial period. The constant struggle against natural disasters, compounded by the difficulties of agricultural life under colonial policies, underscores the precariousness and toil that defined rural existence for many Koreans at the time. Historians might find it valuable for its raw depiction of rural sentiment and the physical and emotional toll of agricultural vulnerability.

탕수
						田植
어제밤 밤새 비고 오드니
들판에서 물소리 난다
아직 비는 그치치 않앗는데
물소리는 요란히난다
아마도 동이 또 터젓는가 보다
작년 가을에 터진 것을
올 봄에 역사해서 막엇드니
그놈의 동이 또 터젓는게로구나.

제길 이놈의 농사를 해먹다니
억껏억껏 김을 다 매놓앗는데
또 탕수가 나고 또 동 터지고
언제나 편안한 날은 없구나
맏애야 산지 들어라
날래 논에 나가자. ＜83＞
