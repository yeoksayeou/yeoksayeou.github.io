The Sixth Official/Sense
Why Mr. Yi Kwangsu Cannot Leave Home

Ch’unwŏn (春園 - Yi Kwangsu's pen name) had published a statement in the Tonga Ilbo announcing that he would discontinue the first part of his novel "Hŭk" (흙 - Earth), which he had been serializing in the paper, and would instead leave for a Tan’gun Historical Site Expedition (檀君遺跡探査). However, before long, Ch’unwŏn did not go, and instead, Mr. Hyŏn Chin-gŏn (玄鎭健), the newspaper's Social Affairs Section Chief, went in his place, and the serialization of "Hŭk" resumed.

While there are various speculations about the reason for this change, investigation reveals it was because his wife allegedly made a fuss, asking how a person missing one kidney could possibly climb mountains.

Furthermore, it is said that behind his wife's determined efforts to stop him lies the strong indication that she will soon be blessed with a precious baby boy (옥동자?). Gossiping friends are abuzz, saying that since Ch’unwŏn already has three sons, if he gains one daughter this time, his fortune regarding descendants (子孫福) will fit the standard pattern perfectly.

**Summary**

This short news piece reports that the famous writer Yi Kwangsu (pen name Ch'unwŏn) canceled his planned expedition to Tan'gun historical sites, which he had announced in the Tonga Ilbo, where he was serializing his novel "Hŭk". The article attributes the cancellation primarily to his wife's strong objections due to his health (missing a kidney) and her apparent pregnancy. Instead of Yi, Hyŏn Chin-gŏn, the newspaper's social affairs chief, undertook the trip. Friends speculate about the expected child, hoping for a daughter to balance his three sons. From a colonial history perspective, the article offers a glimpse into the personal life and public image management of a major intellectual figure like Yi Kwangsu, revealing how personal matters (health, family pressures) intersected with public activities (writing, nationalist-tinged expeditions like the Tan'gun search) and were subject to public discussion and gossip even under colonial rule. It also subtly shows the workings of the press (Tonga Ilbo) and the interactions between prominent literary figures.

第六官
李光洙씨가 집을 못떠나는 까닭
春園이 지난 날에 동아일보에 게재하든 소설 흙은 上篇으로 중지하고 檀君遺跡探査로 떠나겟노라는 성명을 紙上에다 실리더니 未久에 춘원이 나니가고 그 대신 同社 社會部長 玄鎭健君이 가게 되고 「흙」이 다시 오르게 되엇다. 그리된 까닭에 여러 가지로 추측되지마는 탐사한 바에 의하면 令夫人께서 腎臟 한쪽 없는 사람이 산에를 어떠케 오르느냐고 야단을 친 까닭이라 한다. 그리고 부인께서 한사코 만류하는 裡面에는 近近에 옥동자(?)를 얻으실 징조가 농후하기 따문이라 한다. 뒷공론하는 친구들은 춘원이 이미 3男이 잇으니 이번에 1女만 득하면 子孫福은 格대로 타는 셈이라고 분분하다.
