Section 6, An Tosan's Dentures

An Tosan (安島山), who was arrested in Shanghai, stayed at the Kyŏnggi Provincial Police Department for over 40 days before being transferred to the prosecutor's office. Before his capture, his teeth were damaged, and all but six front teeth had been pulled out. He was arrested before he could get dentures (入齒). Therefore, during the month he spent at the Shanghai Consulate, dentist Yi Musang (李武相 齒村醫) visited the detention center to fit him completely with dentures before he came to Korea (朝鮮). However, while he was at the police department, those dentures broke again. Consequently, Kyŏngsŏng dentist Mr. Ham Sŏkt'ae (咸錫泰) reportedly visited the detention center almost daily to make new dentures.

Originally, the plan was to transfer him to the prosecutor's office (送局) on July 7th or 8th, but because the prosecutor's office was busy due to the aforementioned "collusion incident" (談合 事件), the transfer was delayed by a week. This delay, it's said, turned out to be convenient for getting the dentures made.

According to dentist Ham, even if one goes to prison (형무소), a dentist can visit to provide dentures, and he himself has previously made dentures for Mr. Kim Yaksu (金若水) in prison. <27>

**Summary**

The article reports on the dental troubles of An Tosan (An Ch'angho) following his arrest in Shanghai and transfer to Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul) in 1932. After having most teeth removed prior to capture, he received dentures while detained in Shanghai, but these broke while he was held by the Kyŏnggi Provincial Police. A Kyŏngsŏng dentist, Ham Sŏkt'ae, then made new dentures for him in the detention center. The transfer to the prosecutor's office was delayed, coincidentally allowing time for the dental work. The dentist notes that dental care, including dentures, could be provided even within the prison system, citing a previous case involving Kim Yaksu. For historians, this piece offers a glimpse into the physical condition and treatment of a prominent independence activist under Japanese colonial detention. It highlights the logistical aspects of prisoner care, including dental treatment, within the colonial legal and penal system, and the involvement of specific Korean professionals like dentists Ham Sŏkt'ae and Yi Musang. The mention of a "collusion incident" delaying proceedings also points to other concurrent events occupying the colonial authorities.
