**Body Text Translation:**
White Clothes
						Yi Wŏram

These clothes wrapped around my body are white,
Being white, they look even whiter still.
Like white jade, like the inside of a gourd.
May my heart also be like these white clothes.

That person walking busily over there,
Like me, their clothes are white and their hair is black.
It seems perhaps they are my sibling.
Hey you, may your heart also be like those white clothes.

As the color of these clothes is the same, and the heart is like these clothes,
Our will must be the same, our blood must be one blood,
The path we walk must also be the same.
Like these white clothes. <85>

**Summary**

This poem by Yi Wŏram celebrates the traditional white clothing of Koreans. The speaker reflects on the purity symbolized by the white clothes, wishing for their own heart and the hearts of fellow Koreans (identified by their white clothes and black hair) to be as pure. The poem emphasizes unity and shared identity ("one blood," "same path") symbolized by the common attire. From a historical perspective, during the Japanese colonial period, the emphasis on "white clothes" (백의민족 - the white-clad people) served as a potent symbol of Korean national identity and cultural persistence against assimilation pressures. Historians might find the poem's gentle assertion of shared Korean identity and purity through the symbol of white clothing interesting, especially its publication date in 1932 when colonial controls were tightening.

白衣
						李月岩
내몸에 감긴 이 옷 히고나
히다고 보니 더욱 히여 보이네
백옥 같고나 박 속 같고나
내 마음도 이 힌옷과 같이.

저기 바쁘게 걸어가는 저 사람
나같이 옷은 히고 머리는 검고나
아마 우리 형제인가 보이
여보 당신 마음도 그 힌옷과 같이.

이 옷빛도 같고 마음도 이 옷 같으니
뜻도 같으리 피도 한피리
걸어가는 그 길도 같으리
이 힌옷과 같이. ＜85＞
