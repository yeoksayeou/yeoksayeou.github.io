To a friend who came visiting in the rain
						Cho Un

Even with just last night's rain, it was decent enough for the barley;
It should have cleared up, why does it keep raining so drearily?
They say spring rain is sticky, how did you come through this mud?

On the rain-soaked tree branches, new buds are pointy-pointy;
The inner leaves of the grass are vividly green and shiny.
You too, having been soaked by the rain, seem to have grown an inch (寸) in affection. <102>

**Summary**

This short poem by Cho Un describes the poet's feelings upon a friend visiting him despite a persistent, muddy rain. The poet contrasts the dreary rain with the positive effect it has on nature (barley, tree buds, grass) and metaphorically extends this nourishing effect to his friendship, suggesting the friend's effort deepened their bond ("grown an inch in affection"). From a historical perspective, the poem is interesting for its use of older Korean spellings and vocabulary from the 1930s. Published during the Japanese colonial period, its focus on personal connection and nature, rather than overt political themes, offers a glimpse into the apolitical or personal lyrical expressions prevalent at the time, possibly reflecting a quiet endurance of human values.

비맞고 찾아온 벗에게
						曺雲
어제밤 비만해도 보리에는 무던하다
그만 갤 것이지 어이 이리 구지오노
봄비는 찰지다는데 질어 어이 왓는가

비 맞은 나무가지 새엄이 뾔쪽뾔쪽
잔디 속닢이 파릇파릇 윤이 난다
자네도 비를 맞어서 정이 치(寸)나 자랏네 ＜102＞
