Section 6, Ill-fated Man of Letters

Sŏhae (曙海) Ch'oe Haksong (崔鶴松) has died. There is no one who does not regret it. He first came to Seoul at the age of 20, all alone with just one bundle. Upon arrival, he threw himself into the Chosŏn Mundan Sa (朝鮮文壇社) managed by Pang In'gŭn (方仁根), but that too was a life of hardship. When he married the younger sister of Cho Un (曺雲), they began their life together without a single piece of furniture. It is said that even as a reporter for the Chungoe Ilbo (中外日報), the months he couldn't receive his salary outnumbered the months he could. After suffering so much, just as he was finally able to achieve a somewhat stable life, he departed from this world. It is said he passed away while crying out for several days, "I must live. I must live," leaving behind his unsupported elderly mother and two children under his care.
Because his brilliant talent could not be fully realized due to his profession, and because he died young, everyone who participated in the funeral lamented that this was an immense loss for Chosŏn. <49>

**Summary**

The article reports the death of the writer Ch'oe Haksong (崔鶴松), known by the pen name Sŏhae (曙海). It recounts his difficult life, marked by poverty from his arrival in Seoul, through his time at Chosŏn Mundan Sa, his marriage, and his struggles as a reporter for the Chungoe Ilbo where he often went unpaid. Just as his life began to stabilize, he died young, leaving behind his mother and two children. The article emphasizes the tragedy of his unrealized potential and the loss his death represents for Korean literature. For historians, this piece offers a glimpse into the precarious economic conditions faced by intellectuals and writers in colonial Korea during the 1930s. It highlights the financial instability even for those employed by newspapers and literary organizations, and underscores the societal value placed on literary talent despite such hardships.

제6관, 薄命의 文人
曙海 崔鶴松 군이 죽엇다. 누구나 아깝게 아니 여기는 이가 없다. 그는 처음 보따리 하나 가지고 혈혈단신으로 20세에 서울로 왓다. 와서 方仁根 군이 경영하는 朝鮮文壇社에 투신햇으나 그 역 고생살이엿다. 曺雲 군의 妹씨와 결혼하얏을 때도 세간 하나 없이 살림이라고 시작햇다. 中外日報 기자로도 월급 못받는 달이 받는 달보다 많앗다고 한다. 그러케 고생을 하다가 겨우 좀 안정된 생활을 하게 되니까 그만 세상을 떠낫다. 의탁 없는 노모와 슬하의 兩兒를 두고 며칠제 「살아야 한다. 살아야 한다」 부르짖으며 떠낫다고 한다.
그의 훌륭한 천재가 직업 따문에 충분 발휘가 못되다가 또 요절하엿으니 이것은 조선의 막대한 손실이라고 장례에 참열한 이마다 애석히 여기엇다.＜49＞
