Article Type:	소식 (News/Report)

An Chaehong, the former president of the Chosŏn Ilbo, who had been imprisoned for some time taking responsibility for the relief fund embezzlement case, was released on bail the other day, although the case is still under preliminary examination.

Upon returning to the world, seeing that the newspaper he had built up over a long time has fallen into the hands of others must surely fill him with deep emotion. <20>

**Summary**

This short news item reports the release on bail of An Chaehong (안재홍), the former president of the newspaper Chosŏn Ilbo (조선일보), in August 1932. He had been imprisoned in connection with a relief fund embezzlement case, which was still undergoing preliminary examination at the time of his release. The article notes the poignant situation of An returning to society only to find the newspaper he had long been associated with now under different management. For historians, this piece highlights the legal troubles faced by prominent Korean figures like An Chaehong, a known nationalist, under Japanese colonial rule. It also touches upon the internal politics and changes within major Korean institutions like the Chosŏn Ilbo during this period, potentially reflecting pressures or shifts in control influenced by the colonial authorities or internal factionalism exacerbated by such incidents.
