The Sixth Official, Master O-bang Ch'oe Hŭng-jong

Mr. Ch'oe Hŭng-jong (崔興琮氏) of Mokp'o (木浦), who travels between the capital and the countryside (京鄕) working for the relief of leprosy patients and shows extraordinary concern, recently took the pen name "O-bang" (五放). When asked its meaning, it is said to be as follows:

In family matters, negligent (放漫)

At the company, profligate (放逸)

In the political sphere, exempted (放免)

In religious life, wandering (放浪)

From the perspective of powerful families (권문세가), licentious (放恣) <31>

**Summary**

This brief news item introduces Mr. Ch'oe Hŭng-jong of Mokp'o, noted for his dedicated work aiding leprosy patients across Korea. He has recently adopted the pen name "O-bang" (五放), meaning "Five Negligences/Releases." The name humorously reflects his self-perceived character: negligent towards family, profligate in business, exempt from politics, wandering in faith, and unrestrained in the eyes of the elite. From a historical perspective, the article provides insight into social welfare activities (specifically leprosy aid, a significant issue) in colonial Korea and the use of pen names for self-expression, potentially hinting at a non-conformist attitude towards societal expectations during that period through its self-deprecating humor.
