**Summary**

This article provides a biographical profile of Pyŏn Kwang-ho (pen name San'gang), a lawyer active in Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul) in 1933. Born in 1889, he came from a notable background (father was a prefect in Old Korea), received legal training before the annexation, and worked as both a judge and a lawyer starting in 1910. He also lectured at Posŏng and Buddhist colleges and was involved with newspapers while living in Beijing. He authored several books on diverse topics, enjoyed reading religious texts despite having no formal religion, and liked hiking and travel. From a historical perspective, Pyŏn's profile is interesting as it details a figure educated under the old Korean system who successfully transitioned into a professional career (law) spanning the colonial period, starting right from the year of annexation (Yunghŭi 4 = 1910). His time in Beijing and his list of publications, including one titled "Theory of Imperialism," suggest intellectual engagement beyond his legal practice and could be of interest to historians studying Korean intellectual life and responses to colonialism during this era.
