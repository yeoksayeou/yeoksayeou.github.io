**Summary**

This biographical entry from the January 1933 issue of *Tonggwang* magazine details the background of Cho Pyŏngok, then the Business Bureau Director of the *Chosŏn Ilbo* newspaper. It lists his pen name, doctorate, birthdate, family origin, current address, family details (father's occupation, marital status, wife's name/age, children), extensive educational background including studies in the United States (Wyoming Seminary, Columbia University), previous teaching positions at Paechae Haktang and Yonhi College, and his past and present affiliations with nationalist organizations Tonguhoe and Sin'ganhoe. From a colonial history perspective, Cho's profile is significant as it showcases a highly educated Korean elite figure with extensive Western education (notably a PhD from Columbia) who held prominent positions in both academia (Yonhi College) and media (*Chosŏn Ilbo*), while also being actively involved in major Korean nationalist organizations like the Sin'ganhoe and Tonguhoe during the Japanese colonial period. His trajectory represents a path taken by some members of the Korean elite under Japanese rule, balancing professional careers with nationalist activities.
