Apology Notice

The December issue of *Tonggwang* could not be published due to unavoidable circumstances, and this month's issue has become a combined issue with December.

*Tonggwang* is preparing for an opportunity to make a comeback (捲土重來), so we hope that all readers under heaven (萬天下讀者) will continue to offer their support and encouragement (支持鞭撻).

From the Tonggwang Company ＜89＞

**Summary**

This brief notice from the *Tonggwang* Company informs readers that the December 1932 issue was skipped due to unspecified "unavoidable circumstances," resulting in the January 1933 issue being a combined one. The company assures readers it is planning a "comeback" (捲土重來) and asks for continued support. For historians, this notice reflects the precarious nature of publishing in colonial Korea, hinting at potential financial difficulties, censorship, or other external pressures faced by Korean cultural enterprises under Japanese rule, even without explicitly stating the cause. The determination to continue ("make a comeback") despite hardship is also notable.
