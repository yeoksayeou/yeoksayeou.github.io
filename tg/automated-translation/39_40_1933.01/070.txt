**Summary**

This is a brief biographical profile of Sŏl Ŭi-sik, the Assistant Editor-in-Chief of the Dong-A Ilbo newspaper in 1933. It provides his pen name, date and place of birth, current residence, father's name, a somewhat self-deprecating summary of his varied education and career (including farming, business, teaching, and 12 years in journalism), his lack of group affiliations, his interests (reading, sports), inability to travel due to finances, and his rejection of established religions. For historians, this profile offers a snapshot of a Korean intellectual and journalist during the colonial period, highlighting his diverse background before settling into a significant role at a major nationalist newspaper. His explicitly stated lack of affiliations and rejection of organized religion might reflect a particular stance or disillusionment common among some intellectuals of the time.
