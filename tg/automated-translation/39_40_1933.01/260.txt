Borrowing the Path
					Kim Hyang'wŏn

When you spoke of the path we should take,
Your passion, burning with righteous indignation (義憤),
Like the rising sun, sublime (崇高), radiant, and forceful,
Stirred my heart.
But when it came time to put those words into practice,
Why was your spirit (元氣) like that?
Like blades of grass collapsing under frost.

When I chided you for your mistakes,
Wearing the dark veil of the face,
As if in repentance (懺悔),
You brought forth endearing tears.
But when we took hands to proceed together,
Why was your behavior like that?
Fearing the light (光明), turning away, seeking ease (安逸). (End) <57>

**Summary**

This poem by Kim Hyang'wŏn contrasts the passionate, righteous words of an unnamed "you" with their subsequent lack of resolve and action. The speaker observes how initial enthusiasm and apparent repentance give way to weakness and a retreat into comfort when faced with the need for actual commitment or hardship. From a historical perspective, the poem likely reflects a critique or sense of disillusionment within Korean society, possibly aimed at intellectuals or activists during the colonial period. Historians might find it interesting as it portrays internal frustrations regarding the gap between ideals and the difficult reality of action under oppressive circumstances, highlighting themes of weakness, fear, or the allure of comfort over struggle.

回路를 빌며
					金鄕苑
네가 우리의 갈길을 말할 때
義憤에 타오르는 너의 열정은
솟는 해와 같이 崇高하고 빛나게 힘잇게
나의 가슴을 움지기더니
허나 그 말을 실천에 옴기자 할때
네-元氣는 왜 그런가
서리맞아 쓸어지는 풀잎과 같이.

너의 잘못을 채죽질 할때
얼울의 검은 보을 쓰고
懺悔한다는 듯이
귀여운 눈물을 자아 내더니
허나 가치나가자 손을 잡을 때
네 행동은 왜 그런가
광명을 무서워 돌아세나니 安逸을 찾아.(끝)＜57＞
