An Tosanj, A Memorandum from One Student about His Time as Principal
					Chinamp'o Hong Ki-chu
Twenty-five years ago from now, in the 2nd year of Yung-hŭi (1908), An Tosanj founded the P'yŏngyang Taesŏng School and personally served as Acting Principal for four years, educating over a thousand young men. I wish to record some of his words and deeds from various aspects as I heard and saw them at that time.

A Brilliant Memory
His memory was transcendent. He invariably conducted an entrance examination (the current oral test) for all new students, bringing each student one by one into a private room and personally questioning them on all sorts of matters to examine the student's overall situation before admitting them. Once examined in this way, he would surely remember the student's face and name. When encountering them in the school or on the street, he would actually call out, "So-and-so," remembering the names of three or four hundred students individually. Some teachers couldn't remember the names of the 50-60 students in a class they had taught for a year, and instances of fumbling were commonplace.

Tosanj and Tobacco
His preferred item could be said to be solely tobacco. He always had no use for things like cigarettes; he needed to smoke one or two pipefuls, like the long tail of a pheasant, of Sŏngch'ŏn tobacco (成川草) packed like Moranbong peak in a long pipe stem (長竹), only then could he perhaps forget his worries and generate some thought. He strictly forbade tobacco for students. At that time, if a student was found smoking, a fine of one Won (壹圓也) was collected as punishment. He instructed the students, saying that when they reached his (Tosanj's) stature, smoking would be acceptable. Anyway, while skipping a few meals was concerning, if he stopped smoking even for a few hours, his mind would become dizzy (眩輂) and even his body would feel fatigued. Therefore, in his living quarters, a portrait of Tan'gun (檀君) and tobacco were indispensable items.

Toilet Cleaning Duty
Something he always taught the students, though it seemed like a very small matter, was a fact that had a huge impact on our behavior: namely, urinating and defecating accurately in the toilet, and spitting while walking or sitting – he always reminded us about these two things. Thus, early in the morning, he would inspect each toilet <45> and if it was unclean, he would invariably clean it himself. Therefore, the general student body was not only influenced by his example but also felt apologetic, always paying extreme attention to urination and defecation, so each toilet was maintained in a relatively clean state.

Pioneer of Women's Liberation
Thirty years ago from now, new educational ideas for men were utterly lacking, a time when thoughts like women's liberation were not even dreamed of. However, he also focused on the issue of women's liberation, first establishing the Chinmyŏng Girls' School in P'yŏngyang to disseminate modern secondary education to women in general, and at the same time, guiding even women from the entertainment world (花柳界) and sending not a few (不少) of them to study in the Kyŏngsŏng area. At that time, he invited a female student who had converted from being such a woman and returned to P'yŏngyang after studying at a school in Kyŏngsŏng, and had her sing songs for the general students, such as "Dear students, meeting you all today brings much gladness..." (9 characters omitted).

Doing Great Work Even with Ears
On Tano Day in the Kiyu year (1909), a large lecture meeting was held at Kwangp'ungjŏng Pavilion inside Ch'ilsŏngmun Gate. The audience numbered over ten thousand, and the speakers and topics were "The Boundless Capital of Great Han" by Yun Ch'i-ho, and "P'yŏngyang Today" by Yi Tong-hwi. The general audience was quiet during the lively eloquence of Mr. Yi, but during Mr. Yun's speech, which was logical but droning, there was some disorder. At this moment, Tosanj briefly took the stage and said, "Ah! Everyone, some people work for the country with cannons and bayonets, some people work for the country with brush and tongue, but all of you who have come here, let us now work for the country with our ears..." As he displayed his torrential eloquence (懸河口辯), the ten thousand-strong audience became deathly quiet, and the lecture meeting concluded peacefully.

Swimming and Stone-Throwing Champion
He was a champion swimmer. One day, he went bathing in the Pot'onggang River with 40-50 students. Although there had been no rain near P'yŏngyang, sudden showers (驟雨) had fallen in areas like the Sunch'ŏn Plain, the source of the Pot'onggang, causing the river to rise (漲水). He first swam across to the other bank amidst the rising current, saying the current was extremely strong (甚激) and swimming was impossible, so not a single student followed him in swimming. Also, he was skilled in P'yŏngyang's famous stone fights (石戰), that is, stone throwing (投石). One day, again taking students along, he went for a walk up Ch'ŏngnyubyŏk cliff. From atop that cliff, he threw a stone, and it landed on the opposite bank, Nŭngnado island (越便綾羅島). Among that many students, there was none who could throw a stone like him. <46>

Proficient in Chinese Classics Too
Regarding Tosanj, the public opinion (世評) at the time was that he was uneducated (especially regarding Chinese Classics, 漢學). Of course, he hadn't studied Chinese texts (漢文) for long, nor had he graduated from middle school in modern studies (新學問), so it might be fair to say he was uneducated, but in reality, that was not so (不然). At that time, the Chinese Classics course at Taesŏng School used the *Yinshuishiwenji* (飮水室文集), written by Liang Qichao (梁啓超) of China. When the teacher in charge, the Sinologist Mr. R, was absent, Tosanj would teach as a substitute (代理敎授). In some aspects, he lectured and interpreted much more (월신) superiorly (우승하게) than Mr. R, occasionally causing Mr. R, the Sinologist, astonishment (驚異) and admiration (歎服). This seems to be because the ideals cherished in his mind were identical to, or perhaps even surpassed, those of the author Liang Qichao, enabling him to expound the text's logic (文理) without difficulty.

A True Believer in Christianity
He had been a believer who converted to Christianity from his youth. Especially at that time, to cultivate Christ's spirit of sacrifice among the youth, he established a Bible study group within the school. Every Wednesday afternoon after classes, he invited leading figures (泰斗) of the Christian world like the late Pastor Chŏn Tŏk-ki, missionaries Ki Il (奇一) and Pu Tu-il (富斗一) (who was an athlete good at tumbling, and was made to demonstrate his skill), and other teachers to instill the Christian spirit. At the same time, he encouraged students to attend church every Sunday (每日曜), gathering the non-believing students separately in the auditorium and personally preaching on topics such as "Hungering and Thirsting for Righteousness" (飢渴慕義), while he himself was diligent (不惰) in attending church.

Sports Training
At that time, to encourage exercises like gymnastics, iron bars, and wooden planks among the general students, he invited authorities in that field (斯界) like the late Mr. Chŏng In-mok. He would not only make students blindly rush into danger (盲險猛進) on cliffs and precipices together with him in the severe cold of midwinter (嚴冬雪寒), but also held emergency assemblies every day before dawn (每曉未明), going to places like Mansudae and Ch'ŏngnyubyŏk for calisthenics. They would loudly sing (大聲高唱) songs like "How magnificent are our students! Our military-style marching will not lose to Napoleon's soldiers" and "Iron bones, stone muscles, young lads! Display the spirit of patriotism." When the authorities (當局) forbade this, claiming it disturbed peaceful sleep (安眠妨害), he inevitably conducted training like calisthenics within the school every dawn. Training barefoot on snow and running (驅步) for over 10 ri (about 4km) in scorching heat were commonplace. Moreover, at a time when even the terms baseball and soccer were uncommon, they practiced baseball intensely, occasionally playing matches against Westerners and humbling their "big noses."

Visiting Students and Patriots
His seat was not warm (煖치 못하엿고); he was not settled (安치 못하엿다). <47> Constantly, day and night, sometimes wearing a *kat* and *kamt'u* (갓감투) and straw sandals (메투리), carrying a long pipe stem, he ceaselessly (不息) visited patriots (志士) and wealthy individuals, especially in rural areas, to propagate or persuade them of the necessity of education and industry (實業) (He managed the Masan-dong Pottery Company and the P'yŏngyang T'aegŭk Sŏgwan, and the second T'aegŭk Sŏgwan in Kyŏngsŏng). Whenever time permitted, he would secretly visit the lodgings of students one by one to observe their situation, personally providing moral influence through encouraging virtue and punishing vice (勸善懲惡). Sometimes, he would harmoniously (團樂하게) share meals, even the students' coarse millet rice with soybean paste (土醬粟飯), offering infinite comfort and consolation (撫摩) to the youths living solitarily away from home. Those students felt as if they were studying under the care of their own parents, surging up (용소슴치매) in their hearts, so they did not have the perception of an ordinary principal or teacher, but rather the impression of their own father or elder brother. Consequently, any hint (影子) of other problems was unseen.

Sex Education Matters
As mentioned earlier, while visiting students, he even taught the young students about sexual matters. Specifically regarding masturbation (手O), which has enormous harm, he frankly enumerated (枚擧) its harms and irrational aspects point by point, helping to extinguish even such base thoughts. During each vacation period, he earnestly (懇曲히) instructed (訓喩) married students (at that time, there was even a 33-year-old student with a 13-year-old son) to be careful about marital sexual life after returning home, making the students aware of the effects on mind and body, guiding them to find the right path (正鵠) in sexual life.

Chronic Throat Ailment
Since the time of the Independence Club (獨立協會), he had always delivered fiery speeches (열변을 토하엿다).
Especially after returning from America, he continuously gave long speeches in various places, both capital and country (京鄕 각처에서), so no matter how healthy his vocal cords (聲帶) were, eventually an incurable problem arose, resulting in a throat ailment (咽喉病). Even on cold winter solstice days, if he spoke even for a short while, it was customary for his whole body to be bathed in sweat, and he would close his eyes and suffer for some time. Therefore, his friends (志友) and students advised (勸諫) him to use his vocal cords as little as possible, but he persistently (一向) did not cease his teaching and inspiration.

Meticulous Attention
He opposed the idea that "great men don't fuss over minor details" (大人은 不拘小節) and approached even extremely small matters with meticulous (綿密) attention. A practical example: at that time, there were about 10 poor students (the author was one of them) who received a monthly subsidy of 4 Won (4圓) (3 Won for millet rice, 1 Won for tuition) directly from him. <48> Unfortunately, he was suddenly imprisoned on suspicion related to the An Chung-gŭn incident in Harbin (哈爾賓). He met with Mr. An T'ae-guk (安泰國), his younger brother [Note: actually his cousin], and arranged for him to subsidize those students' school expenses. When Tong-o [An T'ae-guk's pen name] was also imprisoned shortly after, he further asked Mr. Ch'a Ri-sŏk (車利錫) to arrange (周旋) for the support to continue uninterrupted. That's how much attention he paid to everything; he never disregarded small matters, and he respected and acknowledged the personhood of even the poor and children.

Striving for Substance and Diligent Practice (務實力行)
Rather than useless, groundless empty talk (架空捉風하는 空論忘談), he emphasized the principle of striving for substance and diligent practice (務實力行主義), even if it was just one lump of earth/stone (一土石) or half a step (半行步). To realize this principle starting with the general students, he decided that they must bring one stone each when coming to school every morning. Being in a city (都會地), even getting one stone was quite a challenge. They inevitably had to go outside the city walls at night to prepare several stones in advance and bring one each morning. The sight of 400 students each bringing one stone was truly a spectacle. In just a few weeks, the piled-up stone towers (石塔) formed three small Moranbong peaks. Later, when the main auditorium was built, the long surrounding wall (垣墻) was entirely constructed with those stones, proving eloquently even later that the accumulated effort (積功) of that wall was not in vain (虛되지 안는다). (End) <49>

**Summary**

This memoir by Hong Ki-chu, a former student at Taesŏng School, paints a detailed picture of An Ch'ang-ho (pen name Tosanj) during his time as the school's acting principal (c. 1908-1912). An is portrayed as a leader with an extraordinary memory, strict discipline (regarding smoking, hygiene), progressive views (women's education), and remarkable personal charisma and eloquence. The author highlights An's dedication to holistic education, encompassing not only academics (including an unexpected proficiency in Chinese classics) and Christian morals but also rigorous physical training (swimming, stone-throwing, demanding exercises, early baseball), character building (visiting students, sex education), and fostering patriotism through practical action ("stone collecting" for construction, 務實力行). Despite suffering from a chronic throat condition due to constant public speaking, An remained deeply involved in students' lives, even arranging financial support for poor students while imprisoned. The article emphasizes An's meticulous attention to detail, his ability to inspire deep loyalty, and his philosophy of practical action over empty rhetoric.

From the perspective of Korean colonial history, this article is valuable for its firsthand account of nationalist education practices under Japanese rule before the harsher suppression following 1910. It showcases An Ch'ang-ho's methods of fostering national consciousness, physical strength, moral character, and practical skills among youth, subtly preparing them for future leadership and potential resistance within the constraints of the colonial system. The emphasis on physical training, the "stone collecting" initiative as a form of collective action and nation-building metaphor, the promotion of women's education, and An's personal connection with students offer insight into the multifaceted nature of early Korean nationalist movements operating through educational institutions. Historians might find the detailed anecdotes about An's personality, teaching style, specific activities (like baseball against Westerners), and interactions with students particularly revealing about the atmosphere and objectives of nationalist education in P'yŏngyang during this period.

安島山의 校長時代, 一學生의 메모란담
					鎭南浦 洪箕疇
安島山은 距今 25년전 곳 隆熙 2년에 平壤大成學校를 설립하고 친히 代辨敎長으로서 4년간 천여의 청년을 訓育하엿다. 그때 각 방면의 언행 몇가지를 耳聞目睹한 대로 기록하여 보려한다

聰明한 記憶力
그는 기억력이 超越하엿다. 일반 신입학생에게 入學檢定(現行口述試驗)이란 것을 반드시 시행하야 각 학생을 일일히 秘密室로 引入하고 별의 별 문제를 친히 試問하야 그 학생의 모든 事情을 고찰한 후 許入시켯다. 이와 같이 한번 檢定한 학생은 꼭꼭 그 용모와 성명을 기억하야 교내 혹은 路上에서 逢着할 때에는 「아모개」하고 성명을 指呼하야 3,4백의 학생성명을 個個히 기억하여 두는 것이 사실이엇다. 어떤 선생은 일년간 敎授한 한 班 5,60명 학생의 성명을 기억하지 못하고 때때로 어름어름함이 비일비재이엇다.

島山과 煙草
그의 嗜好物은 오직 담배라 할 수 잇다. 항상 卷煙같은 것은 소용이 없시 꿩의 長尾같은 成川草를 長竹에 牧丹峰 같이 한 대 또는 두 대를 喫하여야 우선 忘憂도 되려니와 무슨 사색이 생긴다고 한다. 학생들에게는 煙草를 嚴禁하엿다. 그때 담배먹는 학생이 발견되면 一金壹圓也의 罰金을 懲收하엿다. 그는 학생에게 대하야 訓喩하기를 자기(島山) 만한 身勢에게 달하면 喫煙하여도 무방하다고 하엿다. 하여간 밥을 몇기 굶어도 수상하지만 담배는 몇시간이라도 끊으면 정신이 眩輂하고 육체까지 피로를 느끼게 되는 고로 그의 거실에는 檀君의 肖像畵와 담배는 없지 못할 것이엇다.

便所淸潔의 當番
언제든지 학생에게 교훈하난 바 지극히 적은 일 같으나 吾人 행동에 막대한 관계를 가진 사실 즉 便所에서 大小便 똑똑이 보는 것과 行 坐間에 입버리는 것 이 두 가지는 항상 주의를 주엇다. 그리하야 아츰 일즉이 각 便所間을＜45＞ 순시하고 불결하엿거든 반드시 손수 淸潔을 하엿다. 그러므로 일반 학생은 그의 感化를 받으려니와 미안도 하야 항상 大小便을 極力注意함으로 각 便所는 비교적 청결을 保持하여 나아갓다.

女性解放의 先進
距今 30년 전에는 남자에게 대한 신교육사상이 아주 沒刻하엿는데 여자에게 대한 해방사상같은 것은 꿈조차 꾸지 못할 때이엇다. 그러나 그는 여성해방문제에도 着眼하야 爲先 平壤에 進明女學校를 설립하여 일반 여자에게 중등 신교육을 보급시키는 동시에 花柳界의 여자까지 인도하야 京城 방면으로 유학시켜 준 者가 不少하엿다. 그때 여성으로서 전환하야 京城어떤 학교에서 공부하다가 平壤에 도라온 여학생을 請하야 일반 학생에게 「사랑하는 학생들 오늘날 서로 만나보니 반가운 뜻이 많은 중(9字 略) 등의 창가를 들녀주엇다.

귀로도 큰일한다
己酉 端午날 七星門 내 光風亭에는 大講演會가 개최되엇다. 청중은 무려 만명 이상에 달하엿고 演士와 演題는 「大0의 무궁한 資本」 尹致昊氏 「今日平壤」 李東輝氏엿다. 활발한 李氏의 웅변에 일반 청중은 從容하엿으나 조리잇으나 졸졸한 尹氏의 연설에는 조곰 혼란하엿다. 이때 島山은 暫間 登壇하야 「아! 여러분 어떤 사람은 대포와 총검으로써 나라 일을 하고 어떤 사람은 文筆과 口舌로써 나라 일을 하는데 여게 오신 여러분은 다 이제 귀로써 나라일을 합시다...」하고 懸河口辯을 발휘하매 만여 청중은 쥐죽은 듯이 從容하야 무사히 그 演說會는 끝을 막엇다.

水泳과 投石選手
그는 水泳에 選手이엇다. 하로는 학생 4,50명과 같이 普通江에  沐浴을 가게 되엇다. 平壤 부근에는 降雨가 없엇으나 普通江의 원천인 順川 平原 등지에 驟雨가 와서 普通江은 漲水가 낫다. 그는 몬저 그 漲流 중에 彼岸까지 泳渡하면서 물쌀이 매우 甚激하야 水泳이 불능하다고 하니 1人의 학생도 그를 따라 水泳하는 者가 없엇다. 또한 平壤의 명물인 石戰 곳 投石이 장기이엇다. 하로는 역시 학생들을 다리고 淸流壁上으로 산보를 갓다. 그 壁上에서 돌팔매를 처서 越便綾羅島에 떠러첫다. 그 많은 학생 중에 그만콤 돌팔매치는 者가 없엇다. ＜46＞

漢學도 能通
島山에 대하야 당시 世評이 無識(특히 漢學에 대하야)하다 하는 것이엇다. 물론 그는 漢文도 오래 동안 학습 못하엿고 新學問은 中學도 졸업 못하엿으니 무식하다는 것이 정평이겟으나 그 실은 不然하엿다. 그때 大成學校의 漢文科에는 中國 梁啓超 著 飮水室文集을 便用하엿다. 담임선생 R 漢學者가 결석할 때에는 島山이 代理敎授하엿다.  어떤 점에 잇어서는R씨보다 월신 우승하게 강의하며 해석하야 때때로 한학자 R氏로 하여금 驚異, 歎服하게 하엿다. 이는 그 두뇌에 품은 이상이 著作者인 梁啓超와 동일 아니 그 이상이엇기 때문에 그 文理를 무난히 설파할 수 잇게 됨인 듯하다.

基督敎의 眞信者
그는 소년시대부터 기독교에 귀의한 신자이엇다. 특히 그때 청년들에게 基督의 희생적 정신을 함양시키기 위하야 학교 내에 성경연구회를 두고 每 水曜 午后 下學後에는 기독교계의 泰斗인 故 全德基牧師가 奇一 富斗一(땅재조 잘하는 運動家이엇슴에 그 기능까지 하게 함) 선교사 등 諸 선생을 請邀하야 기독정신을 고취시키는 동시에 每日曜마다 학생으로 하여금 교회당에 가기를 장려하여 不信者의 학생을 따로 강당에 會集시켜 놓고 친히 「飢渴慕義」 등의 문제로써 설교하며 자신 역시 교회당에 출입하기를 不惰하엿다.

스포츠의 訓練
당시 일반학생에게 體操, 鐵棒, 木板 등의 운동을 장려함에는 故 鄭寅穆 선생 같은 斯界의 권위자를 초빙 하야 嚴冬雪寒에 학생들과 같이 斷崖 絶壁 等 같은 곳에 盲險猛進시킬뿐 더러 每曉未明에 비상소집하야 萬壽臺 淸流壁 등지에 가서 保建體操를 하며 「장하도다 우리 學徒 兵式行步가 拿破崙의 군인보다 질 것 없겟네」와 「무쇠 骨格 돌 筋肉 少年男兒야 애국의 정신을 발휘하여라」 등의 唱歌를 大聲高唱하매 당국에서 安眠妨害라고 금지를 하므로 부득이 교내에서 每曉에 保健體操 등의 훈련를 하며 雪上裸足의 敎鍊이며 炎天에 10리 이상 驅步 등은 예사로운 것이엇다. 그러고 野球 蹴球는 名詞조차 흔하지 않든 그때 野球를 맹연습하야 때때로 西洋人과 시합하야 그 큰 코를 납짝하게 하엿다.

學生과 志士訪問
그의 좌석은 煖치 못하엿고 安치 못하엿다.＜47＞ 恒常 晝夜로 어떤 때는 갓감투 쓰고 메투리 신은 長竹을 들고는 특히 농촌의 志士와 富豪들을 찾아 敎育 實業(馬山洞磁器會社와 平壤太極書舘 京城제2 太極書舘 등을 경영하엿음) 등의 必要件을 宣傳 又는 勸諭하기를 不息하엿고 시간여유마다 학생들의 숙소하는 곧을 일일히 암행방문하야 그 동정을 살피며 勸善懲惡으로 인격적 감화를 몸소 주엇다. 어떤 때는 학생이 먹는 土醬粟飯도 같이 團樂하게 식사를 하며 고향을 떠나서 孤寂히 지내는 청소년들에게 무한한 위안과 撫摩를 하여주엇다. 그 학생들은 친부모의 膝下에서 공부하는 듯한 느낌이 마음 가운데 용소슴치매 普通的 校長이나 선생이란 관념이 없고 자기의 친부형과 똑같은 인상을 가지게 되는 고로 무슨 별다른 문제는 影子조차 보지 못하엿다.

性敎育 問題
前記함과 같이 학생을 방문하면서 性問題까지 청년학생에게 가라처 주엇다. 곧 해독이 막대한 手O에 대하야 노골적으로써 그 해독과 불합리한 점을 일일 枚擧하야 그런 추악한 관념까지 소멸시켜 주엇고 방학시기마다 旣婚學生(그때 33세의 학생 13세의 아들 둔 학생까지 잇엇다)에게 귀가 후 부부간 성생활에 주의할 것을 懇曲히 訓喩하야 정신 及 육체에 어떠한 影響이 및게 되는 것을 학생으로 하여금 각성케 하야 성생활의 正鵠을 잡아 나아가도록 지도하여 주엇다.

宿疾인 咽喉病
그는 獨立協會 때부터 항상 열변을 토하엿다.
더구나 美國으로브터 도라와서는 京鄕 각처에서 계속하야 연설을 장시간식 하게 되엇으므로 아모리 건전한 聲帶이나 결국 難治의 故障이 생겨 咽喉病이 되고 말앗다. 오 동지달 치운 날에도 잠시라도 말삼하게 되면 전신을 땀으로 목욕하고 눈을 감고 얼마식 고민하는 것이 통례이엇음으로 志友들과 학생들이 가급적 聲帶를 쓰지 않도록 勸諫하되 一向 교훈과 고취를 끊지 아니 하엿다.

細心한 注意
大人은 不拘小節이란 것을 그는 반대하야 지극히 적은 일에도 綿密한 주의를 가지고 나아갓다. 그 실례의 일로는 그때 그의 앞에서 每月 4圓(粟飯 3圓 授業料 1圓)식 보조받은＜48＞ 빈한한 학생이 10여 人(筆者도 其中의 1人)이 잇엇다. 불행히 哈爾賓의 安重根 사건의 嫌疑로써 불시에 투옥하게 되엇다. 니어 東吾 安泰國氏를 면회하야 그 학생들의 學費를 보조하게 하엿더니 東吾 역시 얼마 못되어서 투옥하게 되매 또한 車利錫氏에게 부탁하야 여전히 계속하도록 周旋하여 주엇다. 그만치도 무삼일에든지 적은 일이라고 부주의하거나 貧賤人과 小兒들에게 까지 그 인격을 존중히 녁이고 인정하여 주엇다.

務實力行
쓸데업는 架空捉風하는 空論忘談보다 一土石과 半行步라도 務實力行主義에 치중하엿다. 이 주의를 일반 학생에게 브터 실현시키기 위하여 每 朝上學時에 반드시 돌 한 개식 가저오기를 결정하엿다. 都會地인 고로 돌 한 개도 여간 큰 문제가 아니다. 不可不 야간에 城 외로 가서 몇 개 식 예비하엿다가 每朝에 持去하게 되엇다. 4백명의 학생이 돌 한 개식 가저오는 광경은 과연 장관이엇다. 불과 몇주일에 積堆된 石塔은 적은 牧丹峰이 세 개나 형성하게 되여서 其後 大講堂 건축할 때에 그 주위의 긴 垣墻은 전부 그 돌로써 축조하게 되어 후일에도 그 垣墻은 그 積功의 虛되지 안는다는 것을 여실히 증명하고 잇다.(끝)＜49＞
