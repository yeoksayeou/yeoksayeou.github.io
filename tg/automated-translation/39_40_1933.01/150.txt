The Poetry of Kim Satkat
					By Yi Ŭngsu

Kim Sakkat's poetry has often been introduced before, and I, the author, have also introduced it several times. Therefore, I believe there is no need to reiterate Kim Sakkat's character or discuss his poetry anew. Here, I intend to introduce a few poems that I believe have not yet been generally published.

*Hunchback Song* (佝僂吟)
1. All people are straight, why are you like that?
Your neck is in your chest, your knees are at your shoulders.
2. Turning your head, you cannot easily see the white sun;
Turning sideways, you can barely see the blue sky.
3. Lying down, you resemble the character 心 (heart) without its three dots;
Standing, you look like a bow shape missing its string.
4. If your returning soul were to go to the netherworld (泉臺),
Surely the coffin would need to be made round.

(Summary) This is a song about a hunchback. While human forms are all straight, oh hunchback, why are you shaped like that? Your neck region is shrunk into your chest, and your knees rise up to your shoulders. Turning your head, you cannot easily see the white sun; tilting your body to one side, you can barely look up at the blue sky. When lying down, you resemble the character 心 (heart) but lack the three dots in the middle; when standing, you are like a bow (弓形) without a string. If your soul returns to the netherworld (泉臺), the coffin must surely be made in a round shape. Note: 也應 means "it should rightfully be..."

*Seeing a Dead Beggar* (見乞人死)
1. Not knowing your surname, not recognizing your name,
Which blue mountain will be your eternal home?
2. Flies swarm the decaying flesh, noisy in the morning sun;
Crows call to the lonely soul, mourning the setting sun. <40>
3. A foot-long short staff is the possession left behind;
A few measures of leftover rice were your food when begging.
4. I send word to the people of the village ahead:
Bring a basketful of earth to shield [this body] from wind and frost.

(Summary) Oh, this corpse of a beggar whose surname and name I do not know! Which blue mountain will become your eternal home? Flies noisily swarm the decaying flesh under the morning sun, and evening crows fly by at sunset, mourning the lonely soul. A foot-long short staff (一尺短笻) is the memento left behind, and a few measures of leftover rice were the food from your begging days. People of the village ahead! I entrust a word to you: please bring a basketful (一簣) of earth and cover this pitiful body to shield it from the wind and frost.

*Song of the Bamboo Hat* (吟笠)
1. My humble hat is like an empty boat (虛舟);
Once put on, I've worn it for forty autumns of my life.
2. A young shepherd lightly equipped follows the field calf;
An old fisherman's true nature accompanies the sandpiper.
3. When drunk, I take it off and hang it on a flowering tree;
When inspired, I carry it up to a moon-viewing pavilion.
4. The hats and robes of worldly folk are all outward adornment;
Alone amid the river's wind and rain, I have no worries.

(Summary) My broad bamboo hat is like an empty boat (虛舟). Once I started wearing it, I have worn it for my entire 40-year life. A young shepherd boy uses it as light gear while following a field calf (野犢), and it reveals the true character of an old fisherman, befriending the white heron (白鴻). When drunk, I take it off and hang it on a 'flowering tree' (看花樹); when feeling inspired, I carry it up to a pavilion for moon-gazing (翫月). While the hats and robes of worldly commoners (俗子) are nothing more than outward adornment (外飾), I alone am without worry amidst the wind and rain filling the river.

*Ode to a Cat* (詠猫)
1. Traversing roads north and south under cover of night,
Among foxes (狐) and wildcats (狸), it ranks as one of the three greats.
2. Its fur, mixed black and white, naturally forms embroidery;
Its eyes, tinged blue-green and yellow, are half-dyed indigo.
3. Before a noble guest's table, it steals fine delicacies;
In an old man's embrace, it snuggles into a warm shirt.
4. "Are there sparrows and mice over there?" acting haughtily,
Its mighty cry when setting out to hunt sounds like bold talk.

(Summary) The creature called a cat, which roams north and south roads taking advantage of the night (乘夜), can truly be called one of the three greats, alongside the fox (狐) and the wildcat (狸). Its fur color is a mix of black and white, naturally forming an embroidery (繡). Its eye color mixes blue-green and yellow, with about half tinged with indigo (藍). When a noble guest visits, it steals delicacies (美饌) from the dining table, and at night, it enters an old man's warm shirt (溫衫) to sleep warmly. Saying, "Are there sparrows (雀) and mice (鼠) over there?", it displays arrogance (驕慢). When it sets out to hunt with a meow ("앵오"), its mighty cry reveals its boldness.

*Kŭmgangsan Mountain* (金剛山)
1. The jade-green cliff path enters the clouds;
A pavilion's scenery makes the poet-traveler halt his staff.
2. Dragon's magic swallows the flying snow-like waterfall;
Sword's spirit cuts and thrusts the heaven-piercing peaks.
3. The immortal bird is white—a crane of several thousand years;
The valley trees are green—old pines three hundred fathoms tall.
4. The monk, unaware of my drowsy spring nap's disturbance,
Suddenly, mindlessly, strikes the sun-setting bell.

(Summary) A jade-green cliff path enters into the clouds, where there is a pavilion (樓) whose scenery can make a poet-traveler stop (住) his short staff (短杖). The magic of dragons swallows (呑) the waterfall that resembles flying snow (飛雪瀑), and the spirit of swords has carved and thrust the peaks (峰) reaching the heavens. The immortal bird (仙禽) is white—a crane aged several thousand years; the valley trees (澗樹) are green—old pines (老松) grown to three hundred fathoms. At this time, unaware that my spring nap (春睡) on the pavilion is being disturbed (惱困), a monk in the temple mindlessly strikes the sun-setting bell (日邊鍾/暮鍾) <41> disruptively. Sometime ago, Mr. Kim Chae-ch'ŏl (金在喆氏) added two lines—"What is it I desire in life? I always intend a visit to Myohyangsan. Mountains piled upon mountains, a thousand peaks, ten thousand bends; road upon road, nine rests for every ten steps."—to this poem in the Tonga Ilbo (東亞日報), calling it a Myohyangsan poem. However, if that were the case, the rhyme words '求' (ku), '遊' (yu), '休' (hyu) would not fit with '中' (chung), '笻' (chong), '峰' (pong), '松' (song), '鍾' (chong). This poem is undoubtedly about Kŭmgangsan.

*Impromptu Autumn Night* (秋夜偶吟)
1. White clouds come to rest at the green mountain pavilion;
The night air and autumn feelings are both remote and dim.
2. The spirit of the field stream enters the room, seeming white;
News of the city mist comes through the blinds, appearing blue.
3. In life, Tu Fu made poetry his obsession;
In death, Liu Ling never sobered up from wine.
4. If you wish to know the meaning of our literary bond,
Do not speak of 'pure' or 'turbid,' call it a 'neck-sharing' friendship.

(Summary) An impromptu poem composed while sharing a cup of wine at a friend's house. White clouds come to rest (來宿) at the Green Mountain Pavilion (碧山亭) visible before me, while both the night air (夜氣) and autumn feelings (秋懷) are remote and dim (杳冥). The spirit of the field stream (野水) penetrates the room, seeming white in spirit, and news of the city mist (市嵐) enters through the blinds (簾), presenting its message as blue. The poetry immortal Tu Fu (杜甫) had a lifelong obsession (癖) with composing poetry, and the wine immortal Liu Ling (劉伶) did not sober up from wine even at death; thus, people each have different habits and undertakings. Though our paths may differ, the friendship between us two friends is profound. Whoever wishes to understand the depth of our bond (交契), do not discuss old stories like 'pure or turbid' (淸濁) or 'neck-sharing friendship' (分頸之交).

*Old Age Lament* (老吟)
1. Who among the five blessings called long life the first?
Yao's saying "much disgrace" shows godlike knowledge.
2. Old acquaintances are all guests returning to the mountains;
The new young are, without end, people of a different generation.
3. Muscles weaken, the voice sounds like a groan;
Stomach is empty, craving only tasty food.
4. Not knowing my inner feelings, they see watching the child as hardship,
Saying I wander idly, they frequently hand the child over for me to hold.

(Summary) Who listed long life (壽) first among the five blessings? Emperor Yao (堯帝), who said that longevity brings much disgrace (多辱), knew this as if like a god (鬼神). If one lives long, old acquaintances have all become travelers to the northern burial mounds (北邙山), while the endless ranks of the new young (新少) make one feel increasingly like a person from a bygone era (隔世人). Muscles (筋肉) weaken (衰耗), always making sounds like groans, and the stomach (胃腸) is empty (虛乏), thinking only of tasty flavors (美味). The women of the household, unaware that even watching a child (兒孩) is a hardship (苦事) for me, say I am idling about (徒遊) and frequently hand the child over for me to hold (抱送).

*To an Old Kisaeng* (贈老妓)
1. When all trees boast spring sun, you alone embrace shadow;
Barely managing, with lingering sorrow, your thoughts remain deep.
2. Like the dream of dry meditation in an old temple among white clouds;
Like the heart of a sick traveler on a lonely boat under the bright moon.
3. Frowning like Xishi, yet spirit-worn, you often face curses;
Singing still comes out chirping, only revealing a faint voice.
4. Yet when it comes to literary composition, you are still <42> truly this brilliant;
Sitting in the blue pavilion, striking the staff, you recite with righteous indignation.

(Summary) At a time when all trees boast the spring sun (春陽), you alone embrace shadow (陰). Barely (애오라지/聊) managing with lingering sorrow (殘愁), your thoughts (意) alone remain deep. Guessing quietly at the condition of this old kisaeng (老妓), it seems like the dream of one practicing dry meditation (枯禪) in an old temple amidst white clouds (白雲古寺), or like the heart (心) of a sick traveler (病客) lying alone on a lonely boat (孤舟) under the bright moon (明月). Though you imitate the frown (嚬顔) of Xishi, being spirit-worn (魂衰), you mostly hear curses (罵言). Your singing (歌唱) still emerges faintly like chirping (啁晰), merely revealing a soft voice (少知音). However, when it comes to literary composition (文章), you are <42> indeed this excellent, sitting in the blue pavilion (靑樓), striking your staff (擊笻), reciting with noble feeling and lament (慷慨吟).

*Lodging at a Village House During Rain* (逢雨宿村家)
1. Crooked wood for rafters, eaves laden with dust;
A space like a measuring box (斗) inside barely fits a body.
2. Lifelong I resigned myself to always bending my long waist;
Tonight, I cannot even manage to stretch out one leg.
3. Rat holes vent smoke everywhere, appearing like black lacquer;
Through the mugwort window and thatched eaves, dawn is unknowable.
4. Although I avoided getting my clothes and hat wet,
Upon leaving, I courteously thanked the owner.

(Summary) I happened to take shelter from the rain for a night in a straw-thatched house (草屋) where crooked wood (曲木) was used for rafters (椽木) and the eaves (簷) were laden with dust. Inside, a room the size of a measuring box (斗) barely allowed me to fit my body (容身). Though I have spent my life resigned to painfully bending my long waist, tonight I cannot even stretch out my legs. Rat holes (鼠穴) open everywhere, venting smoke that looks like black lacquer (漆色), and the mugwort window (蓬窓) is separated by the thatched eaves (茅簷), making it impossible to know when dawn arrives. However, having avoided getting my clothes and hat wet for one night (一夜), I departed after expressing sincere gratitude (慇懃) to the homeowner.

*Portrait/Statue of an Immortal* (仙人盈像)
1. Longmian's living hand masterfully conveyed the spirit;
With jade axe and silver knife, a different kind of person was made.
2. Ten thousand leagues of floating clouds are his long resting place;
Nine thousand bright moons mark the distant time he contemplates.
3. Perhaps resembling the tracks of riding a simurgh at Xuanpu;
Mostly like the illusory crane form of Qingcheng.
4. I wished to follow him, stood lingeringly,
But regret that his cap and shoes are drawings, not real.

(Summary) A poem about a carving of an immortal. Longmian (龍眠) = famous sculptor and painter. 庶幾, 太半 = mostly. This portrait/statue (盈像) of an immortal was likely made by the great master Longmian (龍眠), who transmitted his wondrous spiritual skill (靈技). Using a jade axe (玉斧) and silver knife (銀刀), he indeed created a different kind of person (別樣人). The ten thousand leagues of floating clouds (萬里浮雲) in the background represent the immortal's long resting place (長憩處), and the nine thousand bright moons (九千明月) are the distant stars (星辰) he longs for. It resembles the traces (痕跡) left by those like Yang Penglai who rode a simurgh (鷥鳥), and also seems like Xuanpu (玄圃) or Qingcheng (靑城) where one transformed into an illusory crane (幻鶴). I wanted to follow this immortal and stood lingeringly (佇立), but regrettably, it is a picture, and his cap and shoes (巾屨) are not real (非眞).

*Chief Kang's Poem Expelling a Guest* (姜座首逐客詩)
1. In Sadang-dong village, I sought the house of state councilor;
The founder of the state, great lord, surname Kang.
2. Ancestral tradition follows northern Buddhism;
Descendants, foolish lot, study western barbarian texts.
3. The host peers from under the eaves, lowering his hat brim;
The guest stands at the gate, lamenting the setting sun.
4. Chief (座首), Special Inspector (別監)—titles beyond his station;
Cavalry trooper, foot soldier—that would be fitting.

(Summary) In Sadang-dong village (祠堂洞裡), I sought the house of the state councilor (詞堂), a Mr. Kang (姜氏) who held the title of Boguk Taegwang (輔國大匡). However, the ancestral tradition (先祖遺風) is belief in Buddhism, while the foolish descendants (子孫愚類) are reading texts of the Western Qiang (西羌, i.e., Western learning/texts). Refusing lodging for the night (一夜의 宿寢), the host peers (窺察) from under the eaves (簷下), lowering the brim of his hat (冠角), to see if the guest is leaving or not. But this guest stands at the gate, observing the host's heartless behavior and lamenting the setting sun (夕陽). Scoundrel! Titles like Chief (座首) or Special Inspector (別監) are honors beyond his station (分外). At most, cavalry trooper (騎兵) or foot soldier (步卒) would be appropriate (當當). <43>

*Kaesŏng* (開城)
1. Halting my horse in sorrow in the old kingdom's land and mountains;
Half a millennium of royal enterprise is now just an empty mound.
2. Smoke rises from ruined walls at dusk with cold crows;
Leaves fall on the desolate terrace in autumn with white geese.
3. The stone dogs, aged deep in years, find it hard to turn their tongues;
The copper pavilion, collapsed in ruin, can only hang its head.
4. Looking around, there is another place that wounds the heart:
Sŏnjukkyo Bridge, where the stream chokes and does not flow.

(Summary) I halt my horse sorrowfully amidst the mountains and rivers of the old kingdom (故國江山). The site of half a millennium (半千年) of royal enterprise (王業) before my eyes is now just an empty mound (一空邱). Smoke rises from the ruined walls (弊墻) as evening crows (暮鴉) cry desolately, and falling leaves wander over the desolate terrace (荒廢한 臺) as cold geese (寒鴈) pass by mournfully. The stone dogs (石狗) set up as statues are so old (年深) they find it hard to speak, and the copper pavilion (銅臺) has collapsed (陁滅) and merely hangs its head. Looking around, there is a place that particularly evokes heartbreak (傷心): Sŏnjukkyo Bridge (善竹橋), where the stream is choked (목메여) and cannot flow (涃不流).

*Impromptu* (偶吟)
1. An idyllic village embracing water, backed by mountains;
Sometimes strolling in fields and gardens, sometimes at the study hall.
2. Candle flowers and field snow share the same color;
River willows and red plums are the two lone signs of warmth.
3. Daily seeking quiet pleasures with chess friends;
My heart turns from bustling splendor, far from flattering wine cups.
4. Among people, none are entirely useless;
Discard their shortcomings, take their strengths.
檠花=Candle flower (tree used for bow wood, character 檠)

(Summary) In a secluded village (隱逸鄕) embracing water (抱水) and backed by mountains (背山), I sometimes stroll in the fields and gardens (農圃) and sometimes go to the study hall (書堂). The season is early spring when the candle flower (檠花) and field snow (野雪) have hidden their traces, and the river willows (岸柳) and red plums (紅梅) alone boast the Yang energy (陽氣). Every day, I seek quiet pleasures (閑趣) with chess friends (棋友), so my heart turns away (心却) from bustling splendor (繁華), far removed from the type of association found mostly over flattering wine cups (媚觴). However, the people in this village are also worth associating with; among people, there are none who are completely useless (無不用). If you discard their shortcomings (短點) and take their strengths (長點), they are all good people.

I, the author, believe readers will recall that I have previously provided some introduction regarding Kim Satkat through papers like Tonga (東亞) and Samch'ŏlli (三千里). Now, I am transcribing and translating over 10 collected poems from my notebook. I hope that readers who hold goodwill towards the great poet Kim Satkat will read this with deep appreciation (淸鑒). I especially wish to express my gratitude through this publication to those who, after seeing the poetry collection previously published in Samch'ŏlli, directly sent me manuscripts of Satkat's poems. Furthermore, I hope for continued support.
(The author's address is Hŭngnam-ŭp, Hadŏk-ri 53) <44>

**Summary**

The article presents several poems by the famous wandering poet Kim Satkat (Kim Pyŏng'yŏn), selected by the author Yi Ŭngsu because he believes they were previously unpublished. Yi provides the original Hanja poems, followed by his own detailed paraphrase and interpretation in contemporary (1930s) Korean for each. The poems cover diverse themes: satirical observations of human figures (a hunchback, a dead beggar, an old kisaeng), reflections on his own life and possessions (his bamboo hat), depictions of nature and places (a cat, Kŭmgangsan, Kaesŏng), and musings on friendship, old age, and hospitality (or lack thereof). Yi concludes by referencing his previous work on Kim Satkat and thanking readers who sent him more poems.

From a historical perspective, the article is interesting as it reflects the continued literary interest in traditional figures like Kim Satkat during the Japanese colonial period. Yi Ŭngsu's effort to collect, interpret, and disseminate these poems highlights the preservation and re-evaluation of pre-modern Korean culture amidst modernization and colonial influence. The inclusion of poems critical of inhospitable elites (like Chief Kang) or lamenting the fall of a past dynasty (Kaesŏng poem) could subtly resonate with contemporary feelings under colonial rule. The author's address in Hŭngnam (an industrial city in North Korea) also provides a geographical data point.

金笠의 詩
					李應洙
김사깟의 詩는 일즉이 소개된 바가 많으며 또 筆者 역시 수차 소개한 바 잇다. 따라서 이에 새삼스러히 김사깟의 爲人이라든가 또는 그의 詩를 云謂할 필요는 없을가 한다. 筆者는 여기에 아직 일반적으로 발표되지 아니한 것이라고 생각되는 몇首를 소개하기로 하엿다.

佝僂吟
1. 人皆平直爾何然
項在胸中膝在肩
2. 回首不能看白日
側身惟纔見靑天
3. 臥如心字無三點
立似弓形小一絃
4. 若使泉臺將歸魂
也應棺槨用團圓

(大意) 『등신』(등꼽새)를 두고 읊은 노래다. 인간의 형태가 전부 平直한대 佝僂여 너는 何故로 그 모양인가 項部는 흉중에 움츠러들고 무릅은 뛰여 올라가 억개에 잇고나. 回首하야 白日을 容˜“히 보지 못하고 몸을 한片으로 비스듬이하야 겨우 靑天을 올려다 보며 누으면 심자형인대 그 가운대 三點이 없을 뿐이요 서면 줄(絃)이 없는 弓形이다. 만약 그대 혼이 泉臺로 돌아갈 때에는 棺槨은 필연 圓形으로 맨들어야 할 것이다. 註 也應=마땅이... 하라는 뜻.

見乞人死
1. 不知汝姓不識名
何處靑山子故鄕
2. 蠅侵腐肉喧朝日
烏喚孤魂吊夕陽＜40＞
3. 一尺短笻身後物
數升殘米乞時糧
4. 寄語前村諸子輩
携來一簣掩風霜

(大意) 汝姓도 汝名도 모를 이 乞屍여! 어느곳 靑山이 너의 영원한 고향이 되겟느냐. 튀Œ리가 朝日아래에 喧囂하게 腐肉에 群集하고 暮鴉가 석양에 나러가며 孤魂을 吊喪하네 一尺短笻은 遺物이 되고 數升殘米는 생전 乞時의 양식이엇다. 前村諸子輩들이여 그대들에게 한말을 寄託하노니 부대 흙 一簣를 담어다 이 가련한 신세가 된 시체로 하여금 風霜을 가리게 하라.

吟笠
1. 泞泞我笠等虛舟
一着平生四十秋
2. 牧竪輕裝隨野犢
漁翁本色伴沙鴻
3. 醉來脫掛看花樹
興到携登翫月樓
4. 俗子衣冠皆外飾
滿江風雨獨無愁

(大意) 것뿐한 나의 삿갓은 빈배(虛舟)와 같은대 한번 쓰니 40年 평생을 쓰고 왓다. 牧童兒孩가 이것으로 輕裝하고 野犢을 따러가고 漁翁의 본색이 이로 나타나 白鴻을 동무하는 것이다. 취하여 오면 『看花樹』에 버서 걸고 흥이 나면 翫月하는 樓閣으로 끄을고 올라가는 것이니 世上俗子의 衣冠이 다 外飾에 지나지 못하여도 나만은 滿江風雨에 호올로 근심이 없는 것이다.

詠猫
1. 乘夜橫行路北南
中於狐狸傑爲三
2. 毛分黑白渾成繡
目挾靑黃半染藍
3. 貴客床前偸美饌
老人懷裡傍溫衫
4. 那邊雀鼠能驕慢
出獵雄聲若大談

(大意) 乘夜를 하야 南北路로 橫行하는 고양이란 놈 狐와 狸에 끼워서 足히 三傑이라 하리라. 毛色은 黑白이 相混하야 渾然이 繡를 이루엇고 眼色은 靑黃에 藍色이 折半假量 끼웟다. 貴客이 오면 食床에서 美饌을 盜食하고 밤에 老人의 溫衫속에 들어가 따뜻이 잔다. 那邊에 雀鼠가 잇는냐 하고 驕慢을 피우며 『앵오』하고 出獵할때의 雄聲은 대담한 것을 나타낸다.

金剛山
1. 綠靑壁路入雲中
樓使能詩客住笻
2. 龍造化呑飛雪瀑
劒精神削揷天略
3. 仙禽白幾千年鶴
澗樹靑三百丈松
4. 僧不知吾春睡惱
忽無心打日邊鍾

(大意) 綠靑의 壁路가 雲中으로 들어간대 樓가 하나 잇어 景色이 능히 詩客으로 하여금 短杖을 머믈으게(住)한다. 龍造化가 飛雪瀑을 먹고(呑) 劒精神이 天峰을 깍가 꽂앗다. 仙禽이 히니 幾千年 묵은 鶴이요 澗樹가 푸르니이 三百丈이나 자란 老松이다. 이때에 내 樓上에서 春睡가 惱困한줄을 모르고 寺庵에서는 僧이 日邊鍾(暮鍾)을＜41＞ 擾亂이 친다. 언젠가 金在喆氏가 東亞日報에 平生所欲者何求. 每擬妙香山一遊. 山疊疊千峰萬伋 路層層十步九休. 란 二首를 加하야 此詩를 妙香山詩라 하엿으나 그러타면 『求』 『遊』 『休』란 韻字와 『中』 『笻』 『峰』 『松』 『鍾』이란 韻字가 용납되지 못한다. 이 詩는 필경 金剛山詩다.

秋夜偶吟
1. 白雲來宿碧山亭
夜氣秋懷兩杳冥
2. 野水精神通室白
市嵐消息入簾靑
3. 生來杜甫詩爲癖
死且劉伶酒不醒
4. 欲識吾濟文契意
勿論淸濁謂分頸

(大意) 某友家에 一杯酒를 난누며 읊은 偶吟이다. 眼前에 보이는 碧山亭에 白雲이 來宿하여 잇는대 夜氣와 秋懷가 두을다 杳冥하다. 野水의 정신이 室內에까지 通入하야 그 정신이 白色인 것같고 市嵐의 소식이 발속에 들어와 그 소식이 靑色으로 환영한다. 詩仙인 杜甫는 生來 詩지음을 性癖으로 하고 酒仙인 劉伶은 죽을 때에도 술에서 깨지 못하여 사람을 각각 習癖과 所業이 다른 것이니 우리 두 벗도 行하는 才向은 달러도 우정만은 지극한 것이니 누구든지 우리들의 交契의 의중을 알랴고 淸濁이니 分頸之交니 하는 古事를 論하지 말라.

老吟
1. 五福誰云一日壽
堯言多辱知如神
2. 舊交皆是歸山客
新少無端隔世人
3. 筋力衰耗聲似痛
胃腸虛乏味思珍
4. 內情不識看兒苦
謂我浪遊抱送頻

(大意) 누가 五福에 一日壽라 일럿는고. 壽는 多辱이라 말슴하신 堯帝가 알기를 鬼神 같이 알으섯다. 장수하면 이미 舊交는 다 北邙山 나그내가 되엿는대 新少의 후진은 끝이 없어 자기는 더욱 더욱 隔世人이 되어 버린다. 筋肉이 衰耗하야 늘 알음소래같은 소래를 치고 胃腸은 虛乏하여 가지고 미미만 생각한다. 안사람들은 兒孩보는 것도 苦事인 줄을 모르고 나(長壽者)더러 徒遊한다고 頻繁이 兒孩를 안어 보낸다.

贈老妓
1. 萬木春陽獨抱陰
聊將殘愁意惟深
2. 白雲古寺枯禪夢
明月孤舟病客心
3. 嚬亦魂衰多見罵
喝還啁晰少知音
4. 文章到此猶如此
擊笻靑樓慷慨吟

(大意) 萬木이 다 春陽을 자랑하는 때에 홀로 陰을 않고 애오라지(겨우) 殘愁로써(將) 뜻만(생각만) 오히려 깊음이 잇는 老妓의 情狀을 가만이 추측하건땐 맛치 白雲古寺의 枯禪을 하는 者의 꿈같고 明月孤舟에 외로히 누은 病客의 마음같을 것 같다. 西施의 嚬顔을 본받으나 魂衰한 몸이매 많이 罵言을 들을뿐이요 歌唱이 또 늘 啁晰晰나오나 소리가 적음을 알릴 따름이다. 그런대 文章에 이르러서만은＜42＞ 과연 이 같이 훌륭하야 그 靑樓에 앉어 擊笻三嘆慷慨롭게 부르고 잇다.

逢雨宿村家
1. 曲木爲椽簷着塵
其間如斗僅容身
2. 平生一意長腰屈
今日難謀一脚伸
3. 鼠穴煙通皆似漆
蓬窓茅隔亦無晨
4. 雖然免得衣冠濕
歸去慇懃謝主人

(大意) 曲木으로 椽木을 맨들고 簷아는 몬지를 가득 싫고 옛는 사이에 말(斗)만 한 房이 잇어 겨우 容身을 할 형편인 草屋에서 하로밤의 비를 피하게 되엇다. 평생 나의 이 긴허리를 苦되히 꾸부리고 잘 것을 각오하고 단니는 이몸이지만 오늘밤은 다리조차 펴지 못하겟고나. 鼠穴이 사방에 개통되어 그리로 연기가 漆色같이 껌엏게 끄슬여 나오고 蓬窓은 茅簷을 隔하여 잇어 새벽이 와도 새벽을 모르겟다. 그러나 一夜의 衣冠이 濕할 것을 免하얏으나 떠날 때 집주인에게 慇懃이 사례하고 떠낫다.

仙人盈像
1. 龍眠活手妙傳神
玉斧銀刀別樣人
2. 萬里浮雲長憩處
九千明月遠懷辰
3. 庶幾玄圃乘鷥跡
太半靑城幻鶴身
4. 我欲拍隨延佇立
訝君巾屨談非眞

(大意) 仙人의 彫刻을 두고 읊은 詩.
龍眠=名彫刻家及畵家. 庶幾 太半 거이 龍眠이란 大家가 신묘한 靈技를 傳하야 만든 이 仙人의 盈像이다. 玉斧銀刀로 果然 別樣人을 맨들어 놓앗다. 배후의 萬里浮雲은 仙人의 長憩處요 九千明月은 멀리 그리는 星辰이다. 楊蓬萊等의 鷥鳥를 타고 간 痕跡도 같고 幻鶴하여간 玄圃 靑城같기도 하다. 내함께 이 仙人과 따라가랴 佇立하엿으나 遺憾인 것은 그림이고 그 巾屨(망건과 신)이 眞이 아닙이다.

姜座首逐客詩
1. 祠堂洞裡向詞堂
輔國大匡姓氏姜
2. 先祖遺風依北佛
子孫愚類學西羌
3. 主窺簷下低冠角
客立門前嘆夕陽
4. 座首別監分外事
騎兵步卒可當當

(大意) 祠堂洞裡에 詞堂집을 찾으니 輔國大匡인 姜氏이다. 그런대 先祖遺風은 불교를 신앙함이요 따라 子孫愚類들은 西羌글을 읽고 잇다. 一夜의 宿寢을 거절하고 주인은 簷下에서 나그내의 가나 않가나를 冠角을 낯우어 窺察하고 잇으나 이 나그내는 문전에 서서 이 주인의 무정한 행동을 살펴보며 석양을 탄식하고 섯다. 나뿐놈 座首이니 別監이니 하는 稱號는 分外의 尊稱이다. 기껀 騎兵步卒쯤이 당당할 것이다.＜43＞

開城
1. 故國江山立馬愁
半千王業一空邱
2. 煙生弊墻寒鴉夕
葉落荒臺白鴈秋
3. 石狗年深難轉舌
銅臺陁滅但垂頭
4. 周觀別有傷心處
善竹橋川涃不流

(大意) 故國江山에 愁心스러이 말을 머물고 섯으니 半千年의 王業터가 眼前에는 다만 一空邱일 뿐이다. 연기가 弊墻에 일어나는대 暮鴉가 凄凉이 울고 가고 낙엽이 荒廢한 臺를 방황할제 寒鴈는 구슲으게 지나간다. 우상으로 세워놓은 石狗가 年深하여 말을 전키 難하고 銅臺가 陁滅하야 또한 머리를 숙이고 잇을 뿐이다. 돌아보아 특별이 상심을 자아내는 곳이 잇으니 목메여 물이 흐르지 못하는 善竹橋가 그것이다.

偶吟
1. 抱水背山隱逸鄕
時遊農圃又書堂
2. 檠花野雪相全色
岸柳紅梅二獨陽
3. 日謀閑趣從棋友
心却繁華遠媚觴
4. 人物擧皆無不用
捨其所短取其長
檠花=활나무꽃(弓材에 쓰는 나무 檠字)

(大意) 抱水背山한 隱逸한 鄕土에서 때로 農圃에 놀고 또 서당에 간다. 시절은 檠花野雪이 자최를 감추고 岸柳紅梅두을이 홀로 陽氣를 자랑하는 初春 날마다 棋友를 쫓아 閑趣를 도모하니 마음은 도리혀 繁華하야 交友가 大槪 媚觴一杯酒에 잇는 類와는 멀리 떠나 잇다. 그러나 이 鄕土에 사람들도 다 사귈 만하니 인물이란 擧皆 못 쓸 사람이 없어 그 단점을 버리고 장점을 취하면 다 좋은 사람이다.

筆者 일즉이 東亞 三千里 等紙를 통하야 金笠에 관하야 약간의 소개가 잇엇음을 讀者는 기억할 것이다. 이제 다시 蒐集詩 10餘 篇을 수첩에서 抄譯하는 터이니 조금이라도 金笠이란 浩大한 詩人에 대하야 호의를 가지고 잇는 讀者에게 깊은 淸鑒이 잇기를 바란다. 특히 前番 三千里 所載의 詩抄를 보고 직접 筆者에 笠의 詩稿를 보내주신 분들에게 紙上을 통하야 사의를 올리고 더 나아가 계속적 후원이 잇기를 바라는 바이다.
