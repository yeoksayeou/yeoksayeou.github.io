Article Title: 古時調二首 (Two Old Sijo Poems)
Article Type: 시 (Poem)

Feed the green steed with frosty hooves till plump, wash it in the stream and mount it,
Grind the Dragon Spring Sword with its snowy edge sharp, gird it on.
I wish to establish a great man's loyalty and devotion to the country.
Koryŏ Ch'oe Yŏng

Plant our flag on Changbaek Mountain,
Wash our horses in the Tuman River.
You rotten scholars! Are we not men of valor?
Alas! Whose face shall be painted in the Nŭngyŏn Pavilion?
Yi Dynasty Kim Chong-sŏ <64>

**Summary**

This article presents two historical Sijo poems, traditional three-line Korean verses. The first, attributed to the Goryeo general Ch'oe Yŏng, expresses a warrior's desire to serve the nation with loyalty after preparing his horse and sword. The second, attributed to the Joseon scholar-general Kim Chong-sŏ, boasts of military campaigns reaching Paektu Mountain and the Tumen River, dismisses complacent scholars, and rhetorically asks whose deeds will merit commemoration. For historians studying colonial Korea, the publication of these particular poems in 1926 is significant. Featuring works by famed military figures known for national defense (Ch'oe Yŏng) and expanding territory (Kim Chong-sŏ), the poems likely served to evoke Korean nationalism, historical pride, and a martial spirit during a period of Japanese rule, contrasting past glories with the present subjugation.
