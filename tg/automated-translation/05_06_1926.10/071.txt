Running a magazine in Chosŏn (朝鮮) is a difficult, truly difficult task. On one hand, there are strict laws, and on the other, there are financial difficulties; being attacked from both sides and fighting a desperate battle is the reality of Chosŏn's magazine world. We are grateful that "Tonggwang" (東光), fortunately, received the love of readers across the land from its inception and, less than half a year after publication, is on the path to occupying a firm position in the Chosŏn magazine world, knowing this is thanks to the help of all of you, our comrades inside and outside the country.

Now, to further solidify that foundation and simultaneously forge a close relationship with our readers, we announce the following member system. We welcome anyone who shares our intentions, so please come forward energetically, join hands, and advance. Although there are planned projects centered around the members, they are not yet ready for announcement as preparations are still incomplete. We eagerly await those who possess conviction and courage.

**Summary**

This editorial announcement from the magazine "Tonggwang" in 1926 details the launch of a membership ("Company Friends") program. It highlights the extreme difficulties of publishing in colonial Korea due to strict laws (censorship) and financial hardship. The membership system, requiring annual or lifetime fees, aims to stabilize the magazine's foundation and build a closer relationship with readers. Members receive the magazine for free and get privileges related to planned activities like lectures, a traveling library, book publishing, mail order sales, and social gatherings. For historians, the article explicitly mentions the dual pressures of legal restrictions and financial constraints faced by Korean publishers under Japanese rule. It also reveals a strategy for survival (paid membership) and the kinds of cultural and community-building activities (lectures, libraries) envisioned by Korean intellectuals during this period as ways to engage the public and sustain their publications.
