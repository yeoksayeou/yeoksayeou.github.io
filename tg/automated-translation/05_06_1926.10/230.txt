**Body Text Translation:**
Expressing Feelings on an Autumn Day by the Wang River
						East Sea Sailor (東海水夫)

One

The returning warhorse is distant, ten thousand li away;
Amidst rustling yellow leaves, I ascend the tower alone.
Birdsong ends in the treetops as the evening sun sets;
Wild geese silhouettes drift over reed flowers as autumn waters flow.
New messages from Hansang (漢上) splatter blood in vain;
Looking back towards the half-realm of Kangnam (江南), I am filled with regret.
Pitiable are the white-haired elders lost amidst red powder [worldly pleasures/women];
Caps and robes in decorated halls are in disarray, never put right.

"Two"

When the blood flowed in Changan (長安), it was already drying;
How many heroes were only recognized after they departed?
These days, public sentiment changes along with the parties;
For three years, national policy has been slow to unify the masses.
A famed steed gradually falters, unable to run a thousand li;
A small bird flies high, yet has only a single branch.
Only my old friend remains by the river;
Autumn wind and autumn rain bear witness to our former pledge.

Autumn Day Visiting the Tosan Villa (島山別墅)

Above the sea, the thin clouds of war gradually dissipate;
At An Kong's (安公) country villa, a leisurely evening stroll.
West wind rustles lotus leaves, autumn feels bleak;
Pale moon on yellow flowers, the night is desolate.
The old friend who governed the nation now has white hair; <64>
The little daughter Susan (繡山) still wears her hair down like a child.
Turning back at the gate, I look towards the Changju (長洲) shore;
Countless wild geese descend from the blue sky.
(Tosan's daughter's name is Susan)

Sent from Vancouver Island (雲島), Canada (加拿大), to Journalist Yo Kong (耀公) of the New People's News (新民國報)

Counting the days, the envoy's carriage travels through snow;
In this remote, wild place, the road is still level.
Vast green islands merge with the sky;
Surging rivers flow clear into the sea.
Through ages, the only difficulty has been loving one's country;
For a time, all heroes contend for fame.
Lofty standards beyond the world are also of no help;
Why, then, in Saesang (柴桑), consume fallen blossoms? <64>
<63-64>

**Summary**

The article presents three poems by "Tonghaesu" (East Sea Sailor) expressing melancholy reflections during autumn. The first two poems, set near the "Wang River" and referencing Chinese locations like Changan, Hansang, and Kangnam, lament political chaos, the fleeting nature of heroism, and disillusionment with worldly pursuits. The third poem shifts to a visit with the Korean independence activist An Ch'angho ("An Kong") at his "Tosan Villa," noting his aging and the innocence of his daughter Susan, contrasting the peaceful scene with the lingering "clouds of war." The final poem, sent from Canada to a journalist, reflects on the hardships of patriotism versus the allure of fame, concluding with classical allusions suggesting a potential desire for retreat or purity amidst struggle.

For historians, these poems offer insight into the mindset of a Korean intellectual likely involved in or sympathetic to the independence movement during the 1920s. They reveal engagement with contemporary Chinese political turmoil, reverence for figures like An Ch'angho, connections with the Korean diaspora in North America, and the pervasive sense of disillusionment, duty (patriotism), and longing that characterized the era. The use of classical Chinese poetry and allusions highlights the educational background and cultural milieu of the author.
