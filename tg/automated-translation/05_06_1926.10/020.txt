Call for Submissions: Introducing Organizational Songs and School Songs

The songs possessed by our young men and women today are far too childish, far too disorderly, and far too decadent (데카단). To introduce healthy and elegant songs to the youth, we are collecting organizational songs (회기 會歌) from various groups and school songs (교가 校歌) from various schools. A token of appreciation will be given to those who send them in when they are published. <3>

**Summary**

This short piece from the magazine *Tonggwang* is an announcement calling for readers to submit organizational anthems and school songs. The editors express concern that the songs currently popular among young Koreans are "childish, disorderly, and decadent," and they aim to promote "healthy and elegant" alternatives. This reflects a desire within certain segments of colonial Korean society to guide youth culture towards perceived morally upright and perhaps nationally conscious expressions, contrasting with trends deemed negative or frivolous. Historians might find this interesting as it highlights cultural anxieties and prescriptive efforts regarding youth culture and the role of music during the Japanese colonial period.
