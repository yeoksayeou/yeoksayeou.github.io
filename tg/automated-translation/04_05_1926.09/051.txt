訃告 (Obituary Notice)

We hereby issue an obituary notice as Mr. Kim Hang-chak (金恒作), the Chairman (理事長) of this association (本會), suffered the loss of his mother (外艱喪) on August 8th.

August 9, 1926
From the Suyang Tonguhoe (修養同友會白)
＜18＞

**Summary**

This is a brief obituary notice published by the Suyang Tonguhoe (Self-Cultivation Friends Association) announcing that their chairman, Kim Hang-chak, was in mourning following the death of his mother on August 8, 1926. The notice itself is dated August 9, 1926. From a historical perspective, the text is interesting for its use of Hanja, formal language (including the term 外艱喪 specifically for a mother's death and 白 to indicate the sender), and its reference to a social organization (Suyang Tonguhoe) active during the Japanese colonial period, providing a small glimpse into the social activities and communication styles of the time.
