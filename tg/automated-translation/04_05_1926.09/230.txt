**Body Text Translation:**
Lake Mochou (莫愁湖)
						O Yŏn (吾然)

The Huai River (淮水) flows eastward day and night.
By Stone City (石頭城), Mochou's sorrow lingers.
Ten years cannot exhaust the wife's longing for her husband;
The *Yuefu* (樂府) tradition now sings the tune of Ahou.

Reflections on Zhenjiang (鎭江懷古)
        By the same author (前人)

Through ages, rise and fall are but a dream;
How many vicissitudes north and south of the Great River?
Where now is the Sun family's (孫家) hegemony?
Only the desolate city faces the setting sun.
(King Sun Quan of Wu (吳王權) temporarily made Zhenjiang his capital)

Lamenting the Frontier (悼塞上)
          By the same author (前人)

On the frontier ramparts, a bloody wind blows, carrying the stench of gore;
Ten years of rushing about in a single suit of armor.
Seeking life, how could one bear the shame of clinging to it basely?
Resolving to die, one knows that surviving others is wrong.
A thousand autumns of state history preserve great integrity;
Ten thousand *li* of borderlands look up to heroic might.
Yet now it is all recounted by others;
Do not resent that knowers are few in this world.

Inscription on Mr. Huang Zhe'an of Jurong's Plum Blossom Painting (題句容黃蟄葊先生梅幅)
  By the same author (前人)

One laughs at ice and frost, sharp as knives;
Seeking anonymity, it deliberately avoids the *Li Sao*.
In a quiet window, alone, painting its pure, sparse form;
Between the person and the plum blossom, who stands taller? <75>

**Summary**

This article presents four poems in Classical Chinese by O Yŏn (吾然). The poems touch upon themes of enduring sorrow (Lake Mochou), the transience of power and historical reflection (Zhenjiang), heroic sacrifice and loyalty on the frontier (Lamenting the Frontier), and the integrity and purity symbolized by the plum blossom and its painter (Inscription on Plum Blossom Painting). From the perspective of Korean colonial history, these poems, written by a Korean intellectual using traditional forms and Chinese settings, are interesting. They might represent a subtle way to express contemporary Korean feelings of loss, longing for past sovereignty (like Sun Quan's brief hegemony), admiration for steadfast loyalty in adversity, and the importance of maintaining cultural or personal integrity under oppressive conditions, themes that would resonate with readers facing colonial rule.
