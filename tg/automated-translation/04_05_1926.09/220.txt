Author: 도리
Article Type: 시 (Poem)

Why did I come today
To the back garden I tried not to see?
The balsam flowers my daughter planted
Have bloomed, cluster by cluster.

Did they not know
My daughter has gone?
From every green leaf-bud
They bloom just like that.

Since my baby daughter is gone,
Whose fingers will they redden now?
Sitting before the balsam flowers,
Baby, your father weeps.<75>

**Summary**

This short poem expresses the deep grief of a father mourning his deceased daughter. Visiting the back garden, he sees the balsam flowers ("bongsa kkot") she planted now in full bloom. The flowers' vibrant life contrasts sharply with his daughter's absence, triggering his sorrow. He laments that there is no one left whose fingers the flower petals can dye red, a traditional practice associated with balsam flowers. The poem ends with the father weeping before the flowers, calling out to his child. From a historical perspective, the poem offers a poignant glimpse into personal grief and everyday life during the colonial period. While not explicitly political, its focus on individual loss and memory provides a counterpoint to grand historical narratives, reminding historians of the private sorrows endured by ordinary people during this era. The use of older Korean orthography is also of linguistic interest.

봉사꼿
						도리
안 보려던 뒤란을
오늘 어찌 왓던고
내 딸 심은 봉사꼿
송이 송이 피엇다.

내 딸아가 갓거든
아니 필 줄 모르고
푸른 입새 눈마다
저러케도 피엇나.

내 딸아기 업스니
뉘 손ㅅ가락 붉히랴
봉사꼿 아페 안저
악아, 아비는 운다.＜75＞
