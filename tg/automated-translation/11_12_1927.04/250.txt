**Summary**

[As the main text content (pages 77-83) was not provided, a summary cannot be generated. However, based on the title "Katedro Esperanta(에스페란토강좌 제4회)" (Esperanto Lecture No. 4) by Kim Ŏk, the article was likely the fourth installment in a series teaching the Esperanto language to Korean readers of the magazine *Tonggwang*. It probably covered intermediate grammar points, vocabulary, and possibly translation exercises, continuing from previous lessons.] [From a historical perspective, the publication of Esperanto lessons in a Korean magazine during the Japanese colonial period is significant. It reflects an interest among some Korean intellectuals and the public in international communication and alternative global cultures, potentially as a subtle way to bypass Japanese cultural dominance and connect with the wider world. The choice of Esperanto, a constructed international language aimed at neutrality and ease of learning, might have appealed to those seeking universal communication outside the established linguistic hierarchies dominated by colonial powers.]
