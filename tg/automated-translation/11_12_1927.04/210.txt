When the Wind Blows
						Kŭmjandi

When the wind blows,
Saying it's scary,
The paper door rattles, *bulbul*.

When the wind blows,
Saying it's sorrowful,
The dry branch trembles, *dŏldŏl*,
Shivering, it weeps.

When the wind blows,
Saying it will be caught,
The dry leaf rolls *ttigurŭ*,
Rolling away, it hides.

**Summary**

This children's poem by Kŭmjandi personifies a paper door, a dry branch, and a dry leaf, each reacting with fear and sorrow to the blowing wind. The paper door rattles fearfully, the branch trembles sorrowfully, and the leaf rolls away to hide, fearing capture. From a historical perspective, the poem, published during the Japanese colonial period (1927), could be interpreted metaphorically. The seemingly simple depiction of nature's fear of the wind might subtly reflect the anxieties, helplessness, and desire to hide felt by Koreans under the oppressive colonial regime, making it potentially interesting to historians studying cultural expressions and children's literature of that era.
