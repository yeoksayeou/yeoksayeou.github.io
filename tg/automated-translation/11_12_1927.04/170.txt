Cheongju Cheongnam School Song
						Work of the late Mr. Kim Chong-wŏn

1. On the peninsula protruding from East Asia (亞細洲東部),
In this wondrous and splendid land (江山),
Having chosen a site firm as rock for ten thousand generations (萬世岩石),
Stands my splendidly built Cheongnam School.

Chorus: Precious, precious is this Cheongnam School of ours,
Preserve it eternally and boundlessly, ten thousand years, ten thousand years!

2. This school, a beacon for those who follow (後進者),
Let us firmly establish our standpoint (立脚點),
Learn the three educations of virtue, wisdom, and body (德智軆),
And build figures complete with loyalty, filial piety, and integrity (忠孝節).

3. Leaping over obstacles in the path ahead,
Suppressing laziness (懶怠) on the road to success,
Into this world of eternal spring breeze (萬古春風), boundless,
Let's build new-world figures (新天地 人物) in the realm of education.

**Summary**

This text presents the school song for Cheongju Cheongnam School, written by the late Kim Chong-wŏn and published in 1927. The lyrics express patriotic pride in Korea's landscape, emphasize the school's role in establishing a firm foundation for future generations, and promote the cultivation of virtue, wisdom, body, loyalty, filial piety, and integrity. It encourages students to overcome obstacles and strive for success, aiming to produce pioneering figures in education for a boundless future. For historians, this song provides insight into the educational ideals and nationalist sentiments being fostered in Korean schools during the colonial period, blending traditional Confucian values (loyalty, filial piety) with modern educational concepts (virtue, wisdom, body) and aspirations for national progress despite the colonial context. The emphasis on building "new-world figures" is particularly noteworthy.
