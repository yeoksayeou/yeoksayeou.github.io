Spring Rain

Spring rain, whipped by wind, flutters like threads.
Though it pours all day long, it knows no end.
Old fields will wear new clothes, so come as you please.

Let it pour to its heart's content, let it soak deep within,
So that water may rise in every thirsty branch.
Perhaps new sprouts will emerge even from withered roots.

It falls on the mountains, it sprinkles on the fields.
Will the rain that comes to mountains and fields not come to my house?
Child, prepare the seedbed, I intend to plant flowers.

Wake up, frogs! Willow catkins, you come too!
Butterflies, honeybees, all living creatures, come out!
The precious spring rain comes to Chosŏn (조선), shall we go to meet it? <1>

**Summary**

This poem celebrates the arrival of spring rain, portraying it as a life-giving force that revitalizes the parched land, awakens nature, and brings hope for new growth. The speaker welcomes the rain without reservation, anticipating the renewal of fields, the budding of branches, and the emergence of new life, extending this welcome to their own home and activities like planting flowers. The poem concludes by calling all creatures to welcome the rain arriving in "Chosŏn" (Korea). For historians, the explicit mention of "Chosŏn" in the final line is particularly noteworthy, potentially imbuing the poem's theme of natural renewal with a layer of national hope and longing for revitalization during the Japanese colonial period. The connection between the awaited spring rain and the land of Chosŏn suggests a metaphorical link between nature's cycle and national destiny.

봄ㅅ비
봄ㅅ비에 바람 치어 실 같이 휘날린다.
종일 두고 뿌리어도 그칠줄 모르노네
묵은 밭 새 옷 입으리니 오실대로 오시라.

목마른 가지가지 닯 물이 오르도록
마음껏 뿌리소서 숨이어 들으소서
말았던 뿌리에서도 새싹 날까 함니다.

산에도 나리나니 들에도 뿌리나니
산과 들에 오시는 비 내 집에는 안오시랴
아이야 새앗 갈아라 꽃심을까 하노라.

개구리 잠 깨어라 버들개지 너도 오라
나비도 꿀벌도 은갓 생물 다 나오라
닯봄비 조선에 오나니 마중하러 갈거나＜1＞
