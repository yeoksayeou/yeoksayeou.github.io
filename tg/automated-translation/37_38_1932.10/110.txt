Secret History of 10 Years as a Reporter
						Yu Kwang-yŏl

On September 2, 1919, immediately after the Kimi Incident (己未事件), when Governor-General Saitō (齊藤總督) arrived, the sound of an explosion (爆聲) erupted at the front of Namdaemun Station (南大門 驛頭). The panic and confusion (唐慌岡措) among the consuls of various countries in Kyŏngsŏng, high officials (高官) of the Government-General, Korean aristocrats (朝鮮貴族), civilian figures, and newspaper reporters who had come out to welcome him. This is the memoir (手記) of Yu Kwang-yŏl, who was active as a newspaper reporter at that time. (Continued from previous issue)

Patrolman, Inspector Instantly Killed at the Scene; Two Major Newspaper Reporters Die Tragically

When I arrived at the station, fear and shock (驚駭) washed over everyone's faces like waves. Plainclothes detectives stood in every corner, conducting surveillance (機察). The police eyed a certain Mr. Yang (楊某), who had been at the scene where the XX exploded, as a strong suspect (嫌疑者). He had severely injured his foot at that time and was hospitalized at Severance Hospital (세브란스병원), and his hospital room was reportedly surrounded by plainclothes and uniformed police officers as if forming a wall.

Having learned roughly this much, I took the streetcar back to the Sŏdaemun-jŏng Branch Office (西大門町支局). My colleagues, already aware that the Namdaemun incident had occurred, were apparently about to come looking for me, worried that I might have been arrested (후림뿔에 검거나 되지 아니하엿나) or injured at the scene, as I hadn't returned. On the second floor of the branch office, Mr. Yi Sang-hyŏp (李相協氏) had arrived and was quietly looking through the Kyŏngsŏng T'ongsin (京城通信) dispatches (a news agency then run by a Japanese named Ōgaki Takeo 大垣丈夫). He urgently asked about the scene and drafted (草하여) the text (文案) for the newspaper telegram. Taking that draft, I rushed to the Kwanghwamun Post Office (光化門 郵便局). The Kwanghwamun Post Office was still in its current location, but it was a wooden single-story building (木製平家), and the number of employees was much smaller than now. The clerk (係員) took my telegram, his face also tense, and looked <18> it over. He too seemed to have lost his professional composure due to this sensational, sudden incident (선풍적 돌발사건). I asked him to "Please send it as quickly as possible," and he replied, "Yes. I will send it as quickly as possible," glancing at the clock. That night, a large-scale search order (大搜索令) was issued throughout Kyŏngsŏng (全京城), and the investigation headquarters (搜察本部) was at the Chongno Police Station (종로경찰서), located where the Postal Savings Division of the current Communications Bureau (遞信局) is. The day after the incident, I went to the police station for the first time since becoming a reporter and met with the then-head of the higher police section, a certain Okamoto (岡本某). He said he had stayed up all night, his eyes bloodshot, and added, "We still haven't gotten a handle on things (아즉 대중을 잡을 수 없습니다)."

Among the approximately 30 injured on the day of the incident, one Kyŏnggi-do (京畿道) Provincial Office Inspector (廳巡視) and one patrolman (순사) from the Ponch'ong Police Station (本町警察署) died instantly (卽死). Tachibana Kaoru (橘香某), a special correspondent (특파원) for the Ōsaka Asahi Shinbun (大阪朝日新聞) who stood at the very front, and Yamaguchi Isao (山口諫男), a special correspondent for the Ōsaka Mainichi Shinbun (大阪每日新聞), were critically injured. They suffered for over a year before eventually succumbing to their injuries (致死). A Kyŏngsŏng Ilbo (京城日報) reporter and a member of the Chosŏn Sinmun (조선신문) photography department were also injured.

(7 lines omitted)

Nearly two months after the incident, the actual perpetrator (眞下手者), Kang U-gyu (姜宇奎), was apprehended inside Tongdaemun (동대문) by Inspector Kim T'ae-yang (金泰陽) of the Police Department (警察部).

**Summary**

This excerpt from Yu Kwang-yŏl's memoir recounts his experiences as a reporter covering the immediate aftermath of the bombing attempt on Governor-General Saitō Makoto at Namdaemun Station on September 2, 1919. He describes the tense atmosphere, the police investigation focusing initially on an injured bystander, his own actions in filing a report, the city-wide search, and the casualties, including police officers and two Japanese newspaper correspondents who later died from their injuries. The article concludes by noting the eventual arrest of the actual bomber, Kang U-gyu, two months later. From a historical perspective, the piece offers a valuable first-hand journalistic account of a significant anti-colonial resistance act. It highlights the immediate chaos and fear following the bombing, the workings of the colonial police, the dangers faced even by Japanese journalists covering colonial affairs, and provides specific details about the casualties and the eventual capture of the perpetrator.

記者生活 10年 秘史
						柳光烈
1919년 9월 2일 己未事件 직후 齊藤總督이 부임할 때에 南大門 驛頭에 爆聲이 일어낫다. 出迎나갓든 在京各國領事, 總督府 高官, 朝鮮貴族 及 民間人士 신문기자의 唐慌岡措. 이것은 그때에 신문기자로서 활약하든 柳光烈의 手記다. (前號 繼續)

巡査, 巡視 現場卽死 兩大新聞記者 慘死
정거장에 나와 보니 모든 사람의 얼굴에 공포와 驚駭가 물껼 첫다. 사복형사가 구석구석에 서서 機察하고 잇다. XX터지든 현장에 섯든 楊某를 유력한 혐의자로 경찰에서는 흘겨보는데 그는 그때에 발을 몹시 상하야 세브란스병원에 입원 중이요 병실은 正私服警官이 성을 쌓엇다고 한다.
나는 대개 이많금 알어가지고 전차로 西大門町支局에 들어오니 동료들은 이미 남대문 사변이 일어난 줄은 알고 내가 안도라오기 때문에 혹 후림뿔에 검거나 되지 아니하엿나, 현장에서 부상이나 아니하엿나 하여 마조 나가는 중이엇다고 한다. 支局 2층에는 李相協氏가 와서 고요히 京城通信(당시 大垣丈夫라는 일본인이 경영하는 통신)을 뒤지고 잇더니 불이나케 현장광경을 묻고 신문전보의 文案을 草하여 주기로 나는 그 文案을 가지고 光化門 郵便局으로 달려갓다. 光化門 郵便局은 역시 시방 잇는 자리에 잇엇으나 木製平家로 종업원도 지금 보다는 훨신 적을 때이다. 係員은 나의 전보를 받아 들고 역시 얼골이 긴장하면서＜18＞ 들어다 본다. 그도 이 선풍적 돌발사건에 직업적 냉정을 잃엇든 모양이다. 나는 『될 수 잇는대로 속히 보내달라』고 하니 그도 『네. 될 수 잇는대로 속히 보내겟습니다』
하며 시계를 바라다 본다. 그날 밤에는 全京城에 大搜索令이 나리고 搜察本部는 現 遞信局 간이보험과가 잇는 종로경찰서이엇다. 나는 기자 된 후 처음으로 事變 익일에 경찰서에 가서 당시 고등계 주임이든 岡本某를 만나보니 그는 한밤을 꼼박 새엇다 하면서 붉어진 눈으로 아즉 대중을 잡을 수 없습니다 한다.
사변당일에 부상자 30여명 중에 京畿道 廳巡視 1명, 本町警察署 순사 1명이 즉사하고 제일 선두에 섯든 大阪朝日新聞 특파원 橘香某와 大阪每日新聞 특파원 山口諫男은 重傷을 하야 1年有餘를 앓다가 필경 致死하고 말앗고, 京城日報記者 조선신문사진부원도 부상하엿섯다.
(7行 略)
사건이 지난지 근 2개월이나 되어서 眞下手者 姜宇奎가 동대문 내에서 警察部 警部 金泰陽의 손에 잡히엇다.
