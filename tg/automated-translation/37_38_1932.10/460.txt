At Sunset
						Uch'ŏn (雨泉)

When I see the clouds swirling around the blue sky,
Something in my heart feels longing.
The sunlight in the high sky
Is drying the young lady's laundry you hung out.

Crossing mountains and streams, autumn seems to have arrived.
The bright-eyed young autumn—
Wanting to see its eyes,
I wait for the moon to rise, round and bright. <70>

**Summary**

This short poem by Uch'ŏn (雨泉) captures a moment of quiet contemplation at sunset. The speaker observes the sky and feels a sense of longing, associating the sunlight with laundry drying. The poem then shifts to the arrival of autumn, personified as a young entity with bright eyes, and expresses anticipation for the moonrise. From a historical perspective, the poem offers a glimpse into personal sentiment and lyrical expression during the colonial period, using older Korean spellings and forms ("하날," "너신," "왓나보이," "보과저"). It reflects a connection to nature and seasonal change, themes common in Korean poetry, presented in the language conventions of the early 1930s.

석양에
						雨泉
푸른 하늘 휩싸도는 구름을 보면
무엇인가 내 맘엔 그립습니다.
높은 하날 해빛은
아가씨 너신 빨래 날리옵노니.

산 넘고 내 넘어 가을이 왓나보이.
영농한 어린 가을
눈동자 보과저
두리둥둥 달뜨기를 기다립니다.＜70＞
