**Summary**

This article provides a concise biographical sketch of Cho Man-sik as of October 1932. It details his birthdate, P'yŏngyang origins, family information, education at Sungsil Middle School and Meiji University's law department, and past positions as principal of Osan School and lecturer at Sungsil Professional School. Significantly, it lists his current leadership roles in several key organizations: President of the Korean Products Promotion Association, President of the Kwansŏ Athletic Association, Managing Director of the Kwansŏ Cooperative Business Association, and General Secretary of the P'yŏngyang Christian Youth Association, while also noting his past presidency of the P'yŏngyang branch of the Sin'ganhoe. His hobby is walking, and his religion is Christianity. For historians, this profile is valuable as it captures a prominent moderate nationalist figure during the colonial period. His leadership in the Korean Products Promotion Association highlights the movement emphasizing Korean economic self-sufficiency, while his concurrent roles in educational, cooperative, athletic, and Christian organizations (especially the YMCA) based in P'yŏngyang illustrate the interconnected network of nationalist and civic activities in regional Korea during the 1930s, shortly after the dissolution of the major nationalist coalition, the Sin'ganhoe.
