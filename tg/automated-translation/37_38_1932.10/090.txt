**Summary**

This 1932 article provides a concise biographical sketch of Han Yongun (pen name Manhae), a prominent Buddhist leader and independence activist. It details his birthdate and place, family background (including his father's occupation and his son Poguk's imprisonment for the Kongjakhoe Incident), education, entry into monkhood, key roles such as Superintendent of the Imje Order and one of the 33 signatories of the 1919 Declaration of Independence, past leadership in the Sin'ganhoe, current presidency of the Buddhist Society, major publications including "The Silence of Love," hobbies, and travels to Russia and China. For historians, this piece is valuable as a contemporary snapshot of how a major independence figure was publicly profiled during the colonial period. The mention of his son's imprisonment and his past role in the Sin'ganhoe underscores the ongoing political tensions and resistance activities, while the list of his works and roles highlights his significance in both Buddhist reform and the nationalist movement.
