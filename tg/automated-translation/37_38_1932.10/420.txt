Why Did I Say That Word?
						Cho Chong-hyŏn

Should I have said that word? There are other words to say.
Why did I forget the words I pledged a hundred, a thousand times?
A person intending to do something must guard their inner thoughts.

Just because someone speaks collapsingly, as if pouring out their heart,
Should they be trusted? Why did I say that word?
You too, now, must be hitting your own foot with a stone.

My pledging, "Do not speak," after having spoken was wrong.
If it were good to speak, what need was there to pledge?
Truly, between those who trust, there are no words needing pledges.

Things like vowing in blood are also insincere.
Clenching and unclenching the fist—isn't that also ridiculous?
Comrades who keep faith must do so without speaking.<69>

**Summary**

This poem by Cho Chong-hyŏn expresses deep regret over having spoken words that should have remained unsaid. The speaker laments forgetting prior resolves to keep silent, reflects on the unreliability of effusive speech as an indicator of trustworthiness, and acknowledges the self-inflicted harm caused by this lapse. The poem concludes that true trust and camaraderie exist beyond spoken words and pledges, suggesting that silence is often the mark of genuine faith between companions. For historians, the poem offers insight into sentiments of caution and the potential dangers of careless speech, possibly reflecting the constrained social or political atmosphere of colonial Korea in the early 1930s. The emphasis on unspoken understanding and the critique of overt, potentially insincere pledges might be seen as commentary on navigating relationships in a period of uncertainty and surveillance.

웨 그말을 하엿든가
						趙宗玄
그 말을 할 것인가 할 말이 따로 잇지
열백 번 다지든 말 웨 그러케 잊엇든가.
무슨 일 하려는 사람속 창겨야 하느니.

속을 다 빼줄 듯 쓰러지게 말 한다고
그네를 믿을 것가 웨 그 말을 하엿든가.
그대도 지금에 와선 돌로 발등 찍으리.

말하고 「하지마라」 다진 것이 내 틀렷다
말하여 좋을테면 다질 것이 뭐 잇든고
진실로 믿는 사이면 다질 말이 없는걸.

피로 맹서짓는 그런 것도 실없는 것.
주먹을 쥐략 페략 그도 아니 우수운가.
신의를 지키는 동무 말 안해야 되느니.＜69＞
