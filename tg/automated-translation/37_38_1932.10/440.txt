Article Title: 遺懷 (Lingering Feelings)
Author: 李鏞植
Article Type: 시 (Poem)

When I tossed a pebble into the calm sea,
The waves ran away laughing, ran away laughing.
Saying they would tell, saying they would tell
The island maiden by the sea keeper across the water.

When I sent a song into the quiet night,
The wind listened, tilting its head this way and that, then went away.
Saying it would tell, saying it would tell
The maiden in the inner room of the house beyond the fence.

When I touched a flower petal on the mountain ridge,
The butterfly flew away dancing, flew away dancing.
Saying it would tell, saying it would tell
The flower-keeping maiden on this mountainside.<70>

**Summary**

The poem "Lingering Feelings" by Yi Yong-sik depicts the speaker's attempts to express unspoken emotions through actions directed at nature—tossing a pebble, sending a song, touching a petal. These actions are met with playful responses from the personified elements (waves, wind, butterfly), which promise to convey the message to different symbolic maidens. The poem evokes a mood of gentle longing, shyness, and indirect communication. From a historical perspective, the poem is interesting as an example of lyrical expression during the Japanese colonial period. While not overtly political, its focus on subtle emotions conveyed through nature imagery might reflect a common artistic tendency during a time when direct expression could be constrained, offering historians insight into the personal and aesthetic sensibilities cultivated under occupation.

遺懷
						李鏞植
고요한 바다에 쪼악돌을 던젓드니
물껼은 웃으면서 다러납대다 다러납데다.
물 건너 바다직이 섬색시에게
일르겟다고 일르겟다고.

고요한 밤 가운대 노래를 보냇드니
바람은 갸웃갸웃 노래를 듣고 갑데다.
울넘엇 집 안방 處女에게
일르겟다고 일르겟다고.

산등승이 꽃잎을 만저 봣드니
나비는 춤추면서 다러납데다 다러납데다.
이 산기슭 꽃직이 처녀에게
일르겟다고 일르겟다고.＜70＞
