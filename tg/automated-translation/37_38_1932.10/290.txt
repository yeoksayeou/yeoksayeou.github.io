This biographical entry details the life and career of Kwon Tong-jin (權東鎭), a prominent figure in Ch'ŏndogyo and the Korean independence movement, as of 1932. It outlines his background, education at the Korean Military Academy, early military and government posts, his 12-year exile in Japan following the Eulmi Incident, and his subsequent high-ranking positions within the Ch'ŏndogyo religious organization. The entry also lists his significant involvement in nationalist organizations like the Taehan Hyŏphoe, his role as one of the 33 signers of the Declaration of Independence during the 1919 March 1st Movement, and his position as Vice Chairman of the Sin'ganhoe.
