Modern Who's Who (2) <11>

**Summary**

This article provides biographical details for An Chong-wŏn (pen name Sŏkchŏng), the Principal of Yangjŏng High Common School in 1932. Born in 1874 in Kyŏngsŏng, he graduated from Yangjŏng Private School's law department. His past roles include School Supervisor at Yangjŏng High Common School and Councilor in the Central Council (Chungsūwon) of the former Korean Empire. Currently, besides being the principal, he serves as Secretary-General of the Calligraphy and Painting Association and enjoys reading classical Chinese texts. For historians, this piece offers a snapshot of a Korean educational and cultural figure during the colonial period. His leadership at a prominent Korean school (Yangjŏng) and his past involvement with the Chungsūwon (a body often viewed critically for its advisory role under the Japanese colonial administration, though this text links it to the "former Korean Empire") highlight the complex positions occupied by some Korean elites under Japanese rule. His cultural engagement via the Calligraphy and Painting Association is also noteworthy.
