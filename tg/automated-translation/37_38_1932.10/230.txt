Wang Chŏngwi's Resignation Diary

6th. Chairman of the Executive Yuan, Wang Chŏngwi (汪精衛), requested resignation by telegram to the Nationalist Government and simultaneously urged Chang Hakryang (張學良) to resign, blaming him for weakness towards Japan.

7th. Chang Hakryang submitted his resignation to the Nationalist Government.

9th. Various ministers of the Nationalist Government submitted their joint resignation to the Nanjing Government.

15th. The Central Standing Executive Committee of the Nationalist Government decided and announced the dismissal of Chang Hakryang from all public positions, including Director of the Sujŏng Kongsŏ (綏靖公署 - Pacification Headquarters), and granted permission for him to travel abroad.

The Central Standing Executive Committee of the Nationalist Government decided that Chiang Kai-shek (蔣介石) would concurrently serve as the Chairman of the Pukp'yŏng Military Affairs Branch Committee (北平軍事分會), which would replace the Sujŏng Kongsŏ set to be abolished following Chang Hakryang's departure from office.

19th. Chang Hakryang postponed his departure from P'yŏngyang (離平 - departure from Beiping) due to requests from various generals to halt his resignation, agreed to command the military in Habuk (河北), and the political situation in North China returned to the state before his resignation.

21st. At the Nosan Conference (盧山會議), a compromise between Wang and Chiang (汪蔣妥協) was reached. The details are observed to be as follows:
1. The stance towards Japan and Manchukuo (對日滿) will be handled appropriately after observing the progress of the League of Nations and Japan [missing text].
2. The Northeast Volunteer Army (東北 義勇軍) will henceforth receive aid from the central government.
3. Japan's demand for a crackdown on anti-Japanese (排日) activities will be politely refused.
4. Military affairs in Habuk (河北) will respect the agreement of the recent meeting of generals.
5. Finances will gradually be unified under the central government.
6. Chang Hakryang will be reinstated as a Standing Committee Member of the Pukp'yŏng Branch Committee (北平分會常務委員) and will handle military affairs in North China.
7. Wang Chŏngwi will remain in his post but be granted leave, etc. (Excerpted from newspapers) <24>

**Summary**

This news report chronicles the political turmoil in China during August 1932, starting with Wang Jingwei's (Wang Chŏngwi) resignation and his criticism of Zhang Xueliang's (Chang Hakryang) handling of Japanese aggression. It details Zhang's subsequent resignation, dismissal, and near reinstatement following military pressure, culminating in a compromise reached at the Lushan Conference between Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek (Chang Kaesŏk). The agreement outlined stances on Japan, Manchukuo, aid to volunteer armies, financial unification, and the roles of Zhang and Wang. For historians of Korean colonial history, this article is interesting as it reveals the internal political instability and power struggles within the Chinese Nationalist government while facing intense Japanese pressure, particularly concerning Manchuria (Northeast China). This context directly influenced the geopolitical situation surrounding Korea and the escalating Japanese expansionism that would further impact the peninsula.
