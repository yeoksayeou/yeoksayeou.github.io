Impressions upon Returning Home
						Yi T'ak

In front of every yard, potato stalks leave no room even to spread a mat (멍석).
In the corners of rice paddies and fields, even resting spots are dug up and planted.
On any slightly flat ground, there's no place even to tie a cow.

Seeing how diligently they planted, seeing how they planted and tended,
One wouldn't readily believe they say they are starving, but
Why are there so many sallow and swollen faces (얼골)?

(Poem Review) (Wouldn't you please write your impressions?)<79>

**Summary**

The poem "Impressions upon Returning Home" by Yi T'ak depicts a stark contrast observed in the Korean countryside. The poet notes the extreme diligence of the farmers, cultivating every available inch of land, leaving no space unused. However, despite this intensive labor, the poet observes the prevalence of malnutrition among the people, evidenced by their "sallow and swollen faces." This juxtaposition points towards the harsh socioeconomic conditions faced by Korean farmers during the colonial period. Historians might find the poem significant for its poignant portrayal of rural hardship, suggesting that the fruits of the farmers' intense labor were likely extracted, leaving the cultivators themselves impoverished and hungry, a common theme reflecting the exploitative nature of the colonial agricultural system.

歸鄕所感
						李鐸
뜰 앞마다 감자 포기 멍석 펼데 안 남기고
논ㅅ귀 밭귀엔 쉴 터 마저 파 심엇네. (파서 심음)
조곰만 편편한 데는 소 맬 데도 없어라.

알뜰이 심은 양 보고 심어서 가꾼 양 보니
그네 굶다 함을 믿을 줄 잇으랴만
누렇고 부은 얼골이 어이 그리 많은고.
