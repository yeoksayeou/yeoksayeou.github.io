New Year
						Yohan

New Year, it's the New Year, suddenly it's the New Year
The things I was doing were so many, and the things yet to do are like mountains
Never mind, though it be old work, I shall do it with a new heart.

The resolution I made in my twenties, I still haven't achieved
Whether it's a new year or an old year, how can that resolve slacken?
Lest I be too late, I make a New Year's resolution.

The dawn moon freezes on the empty road, the street gates are firmly shut
Snowy sand swirls, and the world is asleep
When will the new day ever come? It seems so distant, so far away.

The sky is soaked in blood, and the mountain peaks (봉어리) are aflame
The rooster's crow is also vigorous, the cloud flags (긔ㅅ발) are fluttering
Gather your red hearts together, we shall greet the new day. <1>

**Summary**

This poem by Yohan reflects on the arrival of the New Year with a mix of determination and weariness. The speaker acknowledges unfulfilled past resolutions and the daunting tasks ahead but resolves to approach them with a renewed spirit. A sense of bleakness pervades the description of the cold, dark dawn, questioning when a "new day" will arrive. However, the final stanza shifts to powerful, almost violent imagery of a blood-soaked sky and fiery peaks, culminating in an urgent call to gather "red hearts" and forcefully welcome the anticipated new day, signaled by the vigorous rooster crow and fluttering "cloud flags." For historians, the poem is interesting for its blend of personal reflection and strong nationalistic undertones, typical of the colonial era. The stark contrast between the desolate present and the fiercely anticipated, almost revolutionary "new day" (새날), along with imagery like "sky soaked in blood," likely symbolizes the desire for liberation and national renewal amidst the oppressive reality of Japanese rule.

새해
						요한
새해여 새해로다 어느덧 새해로다
하던 일 하 많거늘 할 일도 산 같으이
두어라 묵은 일일망정 새 맘으로 하리라

이십에 세운 뜻을 여태 못 일우었으니
새해요 낡은 해라 그 마음 느꿀것가
행여나 늦을까하여 새해 결심하노라

새벽달 빈 길에 얼고 거릿문 굳굳이 닫겨
눈 모래 휘날리고 세상은 잠 들었으니
언제나 새날이 올까 아득아득하여라

하늘은 피에 젖고 산 봉어리 불키었으니
닭 소리도 긔운차다 구름 긔ㅅ발 휘날린다
붉은 맘 한데 모우라 새날 맞이하리라 ＜1＞
