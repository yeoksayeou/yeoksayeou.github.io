Lamenting Toil (Song of National Preceptor Wŏn'gam)

Alas, people of the Eastern Land!
How can High Heaven not grieve?
Where can I find a long wind to come
And blow my words of weeping blood?

Kwandong Wajong (Anthology of Kŭnjae [An Ch'uk])

Studying books and seeking the Way, I ultimately achieved nothing.
Ashamed of myself for undertaking this journey in such enlightened times.
Just doing my best with humble petitions, trying to apply practical learning.
How dare I seek empty fame through eccentricity?
The people's livelihood is mired in mud and coals, harmony is difficult to save.
The nation's longstanding blindness is a startling thought.
Restlessly on my pillow, my eyes find no peace.
Lying down, I hear the mountain rain pouring deep into the night.

Lingering Thoughts (Anthology of Kajŏng [Yi Kok])

Birds vanish into the vast sky, leaving even more emptiness.
Rise and fall in the blue annals are things of myriad ages past.
Leaving a name and fragrance behind are trivial matters.
Better that one's name was never passed down at all.

Sick and Gloomy (Anthology of Kyŏngnyŏm Chŏng [Yi Chŏn])

In life, too, I did not meet the right time.
In maturity, too, I did not meet the right time.
Though my aspirations did not meet the right time,
In death, how could I not meet the right time?

Feelings Upon Facing Chrysanthemums (Anthology of Mogŭn [Yi Saek])

How can human feelings resemble the non-feeling of things?
Encountering circumstances over the years, I gradually feel injustice.
Happening upon the eastern fence, my face is filled with the difference.
True yellow flowers face a false Yŏnmyŏng (T'ao Yüan-ming).

Having Feelings (Anthology of Un'gok [Wŏn Ch'ŏnsŏk])

The nation's pulse is about to collapse; it must be supported and governed.
Human ethics are about to be discarded; they need to be opened up and spread.
The sovereign's gate is deeply locked, separated by many layers.
The helpless cry out, gazing at that blue sky. <18>

**Summary**

This article from the January 1927 issue of "Tonggwang" presents six classical Korean poems (Hansi) attributed to notable figures from the Koryŏ and early Chosŏn periods: Wŏn'gam Kuksa, An Ch'uk (Kŭnjae), Yi Kok (Kajŏng), Yi Chŏn (Kyŏngnyŏm Chŏng), Yi Saek (Mogŭn), and Wŏn Ch'ŏnsŏk (Un'gok). The poems collectively express themes of sorrow for the suffering populace, disillusionment with scholarly pursuits or political life, criticism of the ruling powers, personal feelings of inadequacy or being out of step with the times, and reflections on the futility of fame. For historians, the selection and publication of these particular poems in 1927, during Japanese colonial rule, is noteworthy. The themes of national suffering, critique of governance, and personal anguish, although historical, could have resonated strongly with contemporary Korean readers, potentially serving as an indirect commentary on their own situation and a reaffirmation of shared cultural and historical identity through classical literature.
