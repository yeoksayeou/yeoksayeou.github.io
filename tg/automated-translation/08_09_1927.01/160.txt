Legends of History

The Rabbit's Liver

Long ago, the Dragon Girl of the East Sea suffered from some serious illness. At that time, the physician who examined her illness said,
"To treat this disease, there is no other way but to obtain a rabbit's liver and use it." However, as there was no reason for a rabbit to be in the middle of the sea, everyone present just worried about what should be done.

At this moment, a turtle addressed the Dragon Girl, saying,
"Although I have no talent, I will go onto land and surely catch a rabbit, so there is absolutely no need for you to worry." He immediately went ashore, sought out a rabbit, and tempted it with sweet words, saying, "There is an island in the sea near here. On that island, there is a clear spring, many large rocks, lush forests, and plenty of fruit. Moreover, it is neither cold nor hot. Not only that, but the hawks and dogs (鷹犬) you fear most are completely absent. If you go to that island, you will live comfortably and well for your entire life." Thereupon, the rabbit fell for the turtle's trickery and, without any suspicion, asked to go to the island together.

The turtle carried the rabbit on its back and swam about two or three *li*. Then, turning to the rabbit, he said,
"Our Dragon Girl has fallen seriously ill, and the physician said that if we use a rabbit's liver, she will surely recover. We were wondering how to obtain one, and fortunately, I met you and am carrying you now." Hearing this, the rabbit, improvising, deceived the turtle and replied,
"Oh, is that so? Then why didn't you say so sooner? I am originally a descendant of spirits (神明), so I am skilled at freely taking out my five viscera (五臟), washing them, and putting them back in. Today, my insides felt a little uncomfortable, so I took out my five viscera, washed them, and left them under a rock. Then, suddenly charmed by your words, I completely forgot and came just as I was, carried on your back. What should we do about this? Even if you carry me there now, it's useless. We must go back there and bring the liver. I can live with or without my liver, but if you just take my liver, the Dragon Girl's illness will be cured, and you will receive a reward. Wouldn't that be good for both of us?"

The turtle believed the rabbit's words and carried it back to land. The rabbit quickly jumped down and went into the woods, saying,
"I was deceived by you, but you are a foolish fellow too. Where in the world is there an animal that can live after taking out its liver?" The turtle was dumbfounded, couldn't say anything, and went back into the water. From the "Samguk Sagi" (三國史記).

Nomenclature of the Rabbit

*   *T'osa* (兎絲): Name of a plant (dodder). "On a thousand-year-old pine, there is *pongnyŏng* (茯笭 - Poria cocos fungus) above and *t'osa* (兎絲 - dodder) below."
*   *T'ogyu* (兎葵): Name of a plant. Flowers are white, stem is black.
*   *T'ogu* (兎丘): Name of a plant. Same as *t'osa* (兎絲).
*   *T'oganch'o* (兎肝草): Name of a plant. Also called *Kyegan* (鷄肝 - chicken liver).
*   *T'omok* (兎目): *Koe-gi*? (槐棄?). Refers to the state of new growth (新生의 狀) of the Pagoda Tree (槐). [Translator's Note: 槐棄 seems unusual; perhaps 槐芽 (sprouts) was intended.]
*   *T'ogal* (兎褐): Name of clothing. Made from rabbit fur.
*   *T'osŏm* (兎纖): Name of a food. Made from rabbit meat.
*   *T'osan* (兎山): County name. A district in Hwanghae Province (黃海道).

    (The old name for T'osan (兎山) is *Osahamdal* (烏斯含達). It seems the current Japanese word "ウサギ" (usagi) might have been transferred from our ancient word "烏斯含" (Osaham).)

Rabbit Proverbs

*   The rabbit is startled by its own fart.
*   Slept like a rabbit (i.e., slept lightly).
*   The rabbit that ate snow and the rabbit that ate ice are all different.
*   Seeing a fleeing deer, let go of the caught rabbit.
*   Trying to catch two rabbits, one catches none.
*   In a valley without a tiger, the rabbit is the teacher.<79>

Types of Rabbits

In Europe (유로파), besides the common wild hare (野兎), there is a wild type called "Rabbit" (랍비트), whose scientific name is *Lepus cuniculus*. It originally came from domestic rabbits (家兎, 飼兎). Compared to the common wild hare, its body is smaller, its ears are shorter, it lives in burrows (穴居), and its reproductive power (繁殖力) is very strong. Among Chinese Rabbits (阿兎), there are three types: those called Nanjing Rabbits (南京兎) used only for petting (애완용), those whose meat is supplied for food (食用), and those whose fur (毛) is utilized. Asking about the main ones, for meat, there are the Belgian Hare (白耳義種) and the Patagonian Hare (과타고니아 種), found in the high, dry regions of Asia Minor (소아시아). For fur as a raw material (원료) for textiles (織物), there is the Angora Rabbit (앙꼬라 種). Other pet types include the Dutch Rabbit (和蘭種), Papillon Rabbit? (프프이아種) [Translator's Note: 프프이아 may be a phonetic rendering or typo for a breed like Papillon], and Himalayan Rabbit (히말리아種). They begin reproducing at 7 to 10 months after birth, mate (交尾) just 15 days after giving birth (分娩), reproduce 4 or 5 times a year without regard for even severe cold (酷寒), and produce 4 or 5 to 7 or 8 offspring per litter (1産), so their reproductive power is incredibly fast. From the "Nihon Hyakka Daijiten" (日本百科大辭典).

**Summary**

This article from the January 1927 issue of *Tonggwang* magazine compiles various pieces of information related to rabbits under the title "Legends of History." It begins with the well-known Korean folktale of the rabbit and the turtle, sourced from the *Samguk Sagi*. It then delves into nomenclature, listing classical Chinese terms involving rabbits (plants, clothing, food, places), including a speculative etymology linking the Japanese word "usagi" to an old Korean name. The article continues with Korean proverbs about rabbits, information on rabbit breeds (European, Chinese, specific types like Belgian Hare, Angora) citing a Japanese encyclopedia, and concludes with a lengthy collection of classical Chinese anecdotes and literary references (典故) mentioning rabbits, drawn from various philosophical, historical, and poetic texts like the *Book of Odes*, *Zhuangzi*, *Han Feizi*, *Records of the Grand Historian*, and Tang dynasty records.

From a historical perspective, the article is interesting as it reflects the intellectual landscape of colonial Korea. It blends traditional Korean folklore and history (*Samguk Sagi*), extensive knowledge of Chinese classics (a staple of traditional East Asian education), and modern biological/zoological information imported via Japanese sources (*Nihon Hyakka Daijiten*). The mix highlights the transition period where traditional scholarship coexisted with modern knowledge systems introduced primarily through Japan. The speculation about the origin of the Japanese word "usagi" from Korean also hints at underlying nationalistic sentiments or interests in comparative linguistics during this era.

歷史의 傳說
토끼의 간
옛날에 동해 용녀가 무슨 중병이 들엇섯다. 그때에 그 병을 진찰한 의원이 말하기를
「이 병을 치료하려면 아무리해도 토끼의 간을 구하여 쓰기 전에는 다른 도리가 업겟습니다」고 하엿다. 그러나 바다 가온대 토끼 잇슬 까닭이 업서서 이것을 어찌하면 조탄 말이냐고 좌중이 모도 걱정만 하고 잇섯다.
이때 마침 거북 한 마리가 용녀에게 여쭙기를
「제가 비록 재주는 업스나 무테 나아가서 반듯이 토끼를 잡아올 터이니 결코 근심하실 것이 업슴니다 하고 즉시 무테 나아와서 토끼를 차자보고 감언리설로 꾀이기를 「여긔서 가까운 해중에 섬 하나가 잇는데 그 섬에는 맑은 샘이 잇고 큰 바위도 만흐며 수풀이 무성하고 과실이 만흘 뿐 아니라 춥도안코 덥도 아니하더라. 또 그뿐 아니라 네가 제일 무서워하는 응견(鷹犬)은 하나도 업스니 네가 만일 그 섬에 들어가고 보면 일평생을 편안하게 잘 지낼 것이다」하엿다. 그렷더니 토끼는 그만 거북의 꾀임에 빠지어서 아무 의심업시 그 섬으로 가티 가기를 청하엿다. 거북은 토끼를 제 등에 업고 헤엄을 처서 이삼리쯤 가다가 토끼를 돌아보고
「이번에 우리 용녀께서 중병이 드시엇는데 의원의 말이 토끼의 간을 쓰면 반듯이 평복이 되시겟다 하기에 어떠케 하면 그것을 구할까 하다가 다행히 너를 만나서 업고 오는 것이다」하엿다. 토끼는 이 말을 듯고 임시 변통으로 거북을 속이어 대답하되
「응 그러냐, 그러면 그 말을 웨 진적 하지 안핫느냐. 나는 본래 신명의 자손임으로 맘대로 오장을 끄내어 씻어서 다시 집어너키를 잘한다. 오늘도 뼈ㅅ속이 조곰 편불하기로 오장을 끄내어 씻어서 그대로 바위 미테 너허두고 별안간 네 말에 홀리어서 깜박 이저버리고 그대로 업히어 왓스니 이 일을 어찌하면 조탄 말이냐 그러면 지금은 업어간대도 소용이 업다. 다시 그 곳으로 나가서 간을 가지고 와야 하겟다. 나는 간이 잇서도 살고 업서도 살지마는 너는 내 간만 가지어가면 용녀의 병도 낫고 너도 상을 바들 터이니 피차간에 어찌 조흔 일이 되지 안켓느냐」
하엿다. 거북도 토끼의 말을 밋고 다시 육지로 업고 나왓다. 토끼는 얼는 뛰어나리어서 수풀 속으로 들어가며
「나도 네게 속앗지마는 너도 미련한 놈이다. 세상에 간을 끄내고 살 동물이 어대 잇겟느냐」하엿다. 거북은 어이가 업서서 아무 말도 못하고 물 속으로 들어가 버렷다. 「三國史記」에서

토끼 둘을 잡으려다가 하낫도 못 잡는다.
범업는 골에 토끼가 스승이라.＜79＞

兎의 種類
유로파에서는 보통의 野兎外에 「랍비트」(Rabbit)라 하는 야생하는 者가 잇스니 이는 學名으로 Lepusounicnlus라 하는데 본디 家兎, 飼兎로서 난 것이다. 그것이 보통 野兎에 비하여 몸이 작고 귀가 깔으며 穴居하여 繁殖力이 매우 강하다. 阿兎에는 南京兎라 이름하는 다만 애완용으로만 供하는 것, 肉을 食用에 供하는 것, 毛를 이용하는 것의 3종이 있다. 그 주요한 자를 묻연 육용으로는 白耳義種, 과타고니아 種이 잇서 소아시아 高燥地에 産하고 毛의 織物의 원료로는 「앙꼬라」種이 잇고 기타 애완용으로는 和蘭種, 프프이아種, 히말리아種이 잇스니 生後 7개월 내지 10개월에 번식을 시작하여 分娩後 15일을 지나면 곳 交尾하며 酷寒時도 가리지 안코 1년간 4, 5회나 번식하는데 1産에 4, 5頭 내지 7, 8頭를 産함으로 그 번식력이 엄청 速하다. 「日本百科大辭典」에서
