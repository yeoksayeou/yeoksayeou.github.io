Article Type: 시 (Poem/Lyrics)

Flowing, flowing, flowing without rest,
Soaring, soaring, soaring without end,
The white mountains and the great river are the heartland of the Mugunghwa (Rose of Sharon),
Our house that has risen there is named Chungang (Central).

Strong youths have gathered from thirteen provinces,
Boarding the boat named 'Going to Become Famous' here,
When we each reach the shores we cross to,
Shall we not spread far and wide the light obtained here?

May your ideals be high, may your will be firm,
May your heart and deeds be entirely sincere,
Teaching and learning are the only way,
Thus, achieve breadth and depth.

Polishing and raising virtue step by step,
Is like that mountain striving to pierce the heavens,
Opening and extending wisdom branch by branch,
Is like that river reaching the sea.<52>

**Summary**

This article presents the lyrics for the school song of Chungang Higher Common School, written by Ch'oe Nam-sŏn (pen name Yuktang) and composed by Kim Yŏng-hwan. The song evokes images of Korea's landscape ("white mountains," "great river," "Mugunghwa heartland") and portrays the school as a central gathering place for students from all over the country. It encourages high ideals, strong will, sincerity, diligent learning, and the cultivation of virtue and wisdom, with the ultimate goal of spreading the "light" of knowledge acquired at the school. For historians, the song is interesting as an expression of Korean national identity and aspirations for education and enlightenment during the Japanese colonial period. The use of symbolic language tied to the Korean landscape and the emphasis on cultivating character and knowledge by prominent cultural figures like Ch'oe Nam-sŏn reflect efforts to maintain and foster a distinct Korean spirit despite colonial constraints.

1
흘어흘어 흘어서 쉬임이 없고
솟아솟아 솟아서 그지의 없는
힌메와 한가람은 무궁화 복판
거긔솟은 우리집 니름도 중앙

2
健兒야 모였도다 열세길로서
니름으로 가는 배 예와서 타니
건느는 언덕 각각 다달은 때면
퍼지리랴 골고로 예서 얻은 빛

3
높거라 너의 이상 굳거라 의지
맘과 일은 온전히 지성이거라
가르침과 배움이 오직이로다
이리하야 이루라 넓고 깊어큼

4
걸음걸음 덕성을 닦아 올림은
하늘뚫고 말려는 저 뫼와 같이
가지가지 슬기를 열어 늘임은
바다에 가 그치는 저 가람처럼＜52＞
