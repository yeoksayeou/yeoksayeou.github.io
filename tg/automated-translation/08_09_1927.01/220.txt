The Departed One
						Chŏng Inbo

To think your face is covered with earth,
Overgrown with tangled weeds, O heartless autumn grass!
"Night" oh night, I saw you in my dream, are you at peace?

How could I have known your cherished letters would become sorrow?
The affection flowing line by line has not yet dried up.
Lifting them to my face, it feels as though they cut me.

Thinking of how you looked kindly upon that distant one, I feel regret.
Could it be you could not see me as I am?
How could you know how hateful I became without you?

When your eyes closed, my whole life was covered.
Seeing the temple, I feel wretched, but weeping for you, I feel it more.
When the sleeping rooster flaps its wings and crows, I think, "It must be that time."

Though your frame was small, your voice was loud.
The tightly closed "lips" with wrinkles at the corners were dear.
Your bent, thin waist showed your diligence ("부즈런").

Need I ask about the house site? Gyeongbok Palace too is but a dream.
That Namsan, steeped in sorrow ("한"), is the old countenance you used to see.
Though only tears remain, looking up makes me grieve.

My thoughts are tangled, neither back nor forth make sense. <13>
Tears fall as I write; sighs come after writing.
Lest you might hear, I go out ("외") and look.

Was I in such a rush to see the paper door of your room?
Hurrying past the inner gate's middle door, I fell.
They say the injured arm aches again, but where have you gone?

A daughter-in-law like a daughter; a mother-in-law like a loving mother.
You found it hard to bear even a flower picked too soon.
Now beside the covering earth, please stroke her gently.

The young granddaughter who lost your milk ("젓") continues her life in your embrace.
The marriage you arranged, what of next year?
In all matters, you are not here, what joy ("경") can there be?

Giving away the warm rice from your bowl, eating only cold things,
Dressing others warmly, wearing thin clothes in winter yourself,
You used to say your cotton skirt was fine, now it has become your shroud ("보공").

Will you know that I read and write compositions?
Will you see that everyone praises them?
There is no wind to carry word to you; I wonder if living is truly living.

Sorrowful, sorrowful, yet even a son is a separate body.
Today, when the grave grass has grown thick, does this flesh ("살") exist from then on?
Do not believe anyone ("뉘나") who feigns sorrow with empty words. <14>

**Summary**

This poem by Chŏng Inbo is a deeply personal lament expressing profound grief and longing for a departed loved one, seemingly the speaker's mother-in-law. The speaker, likely a daughter-in-law, recalls cherished memories – the deceased's voice, appearance, diligence, sacrifices, and affection towards her family, especially a granddaughter. The poem contrasts past warmth and presence with the current emptiness and sorrow, using imagery of letters, familiar places like Namsan, and symbolic actions like falling while rushing to the deceased's room. For historians, the poem offers insight into the expression of personal grief within traditional family structures during the colonial period. It highlights Confucian values of filial piety (even from a daughter-in-law), the emotional weight of familial relationships, and provides examples of early modern Korean language usage and spelling conventions from the 1920s.

가신님
						鄭寅普
참아 님의 낫츨 흙으로 가리단 말
우굿이 엉겟스니 무정할 손 추초로다
「밤」니여 꿈에 뵈오니 편안이나 하신가

반갑던 님의 글월 설음될 줄 알엇스리
줄줄이 흐르는 정 상긔아니 말럿도다
밧들어 낫에 대우니 배이는 듯 하여라

뮌나를 고히보심 생각하면 「되」서워라
내양자 그대로를 긔아니 못보심가
내 업서 네 뮈워진 줄 어이 네가 알것가

님의 눈 감으시니 내 일생 다 덥혀를
절보아 가련타만 님을 우러 더늣겨라
자던 닭 나래처 울면 이때러니 하여라

체수는 적으서도 목소리는 크시더니
「이」덜려 옴으신 「입」주룸마다 귀엽더니
굽으신 마른 허리에 「부즈런」이 뵈더니

집터야 물을 것가 경복궁도 꿈이로다
「한」기픈 저 남산이 님 보시던 녯낫치라
계섯자 눈물이라만 외오보니 설워라

생각도 어지럴사 뒤먼저도 바업고야 ＜13＞
쓰다간 눈물이요 쓰고나니 한숨이라
행여나 님들으실까 나가「외」와 봅내다

게신방 미다지를 바라보기 급하던지
안중문 마진채를 밧비돌다 너머저를
다친팔 도진다마는 님은 어대 가신고

딸가튼 며느리요 자모가튼 시어머니
피랴다 일진꼿을 참아늣겨 하시더니
덥흔흙 겻헤잇스니 어루만저 주소서

「젓」일흔 어린 손녀 님의 품에 명을 이어
님께서 정한 혼인 하머대야 내 후년을
만사에 님안게시니 무슨 경이 잇스리

바릿밥 남주시고 잡숫느니 찬것이며
두둑키 다입히고 겨울이라 열분옷을
솜치마 조타지더니 「보공」되고 말아라

글읽어 문장이라 님이 이를 아실것가
남마다 기린다세 님이 이를 보실것가
님일콘 바람업서라 사니산가 하노라

설워라 설워라 해도 아들도 딴몸이라
무덤풀 우군 오늘 이「살」부터 잇단말가
빈말로 설은양함을 뉘나밋지 마옵소 ＜14＞
＜13-14＞
