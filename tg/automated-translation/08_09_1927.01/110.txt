Article Title: 退溪先生曰 (Master Toegye Said)
Author: N/A (Quote attributed to Toegye Sŏnsaeng)
Article Type: 잡저 (Miscellaneous Writing)

Master Toegye said: In all matters—reading books and investigating principles, regulating speech and controlling conduct, down to the myriad activities of daily life—the very first priority is to eliminate the spirit of coarseness and frivolity. Take solemn reverence and self-cultivation as the foundation, and make deep immersion and meticulous inquiry the basis of learning.<47>

**Summary**

This short piece presents a quote from the renowned Joseon Neo-Confucian scholar Yi Hwang (Toegye), emphasizing the paramount importance of seriousness, self-discipline, and humility (莊敬涵養) in all aspects of life, especially in scholarship (窮理, 沉潛硏素). It advises removing superficiality (麤浮氣象) and focusing on deep, reflective learning and conduct. For historians studying colonial Korea, this article highlights the continued reverence for traditional Confucian figures and values like Toegye during the 1920s, possibly as a source of moral guidance or cultural identity amidst Japanese rule. It reflects an effort within Korean intellectual circles to uphold and disseminate indigenous philosophical traditions.
