Regarding time, act as cautiously as possible. Regarding health, be as greedy as possible. Regarding circumstances (境遇), be as ill-tempered as possible. -(六堂目警)-<19>

**Summary**

This short piece presents three aphorisms attributed to Yuktang (Ch'oe Nam-sŏn). The advice given is to be extremely cautious with the passage of time, exceptionally proactive ('greedy') about maintaining one's health, and actively discontent ('ill-tempered') when facing difficult circumstances. From a historical perspective, these terse commands offer insight into the possible coping mechanisms or attitudes encouraged among Koreans during the Japanese colonial period. The emphasis on personal health and the somewhat aggressive stance towards adverse situations ('ill-tempered' regarding circumstances) might reflect a call for resilience and a refusal to passively accept hardship, which could be of interest to historians studying intellectual responses to colonial rule.
