Let Us Go Back, Back to Our Hometown
						Karam

Even the swallows that went south (Kangnam)
Come back seeking their old nests

The old trees bloom
Spring returns as spring
Let us too, to our hometown
Go back and see

Even if we go back home
Who would there be to welcome us?

In the old site like a field of mugwort
Even the mischievous goblins (tokkaebi) making trouble
Only if we return
Will perhaps disappear

But you, my dear/lord, must know
What could I possibly have?

Even if I try to cry
Do I have the strength to make a sound?

Besides this bare body
There is nothing to offer.<51>

**Summary**

This poem by Karam expresses a deep yearning to return to one's hometown, mirroring the natural cycle of swallows returning and trees blooming in spring. However, the return is tinged with sorrow, acknowledging the desolation ("field of mugwort") and lack of welcome. The poet suggests that their return is necessary, perhaps even to dispel the lingering troubles ("goblins"). The poem concludes with a humble admission of having nothing left to offer but one's own self, a poignant expression of devotion and perhaps desperation. For historians, the poem reflects the sense of loss, displacement, and desolate conditions potentially faced by Koreans under colonial rule, coupled with an enduring attachment to their homeland and a will to return and rebuild, even from nothing. The offering of the "bare body" could symbolize a readiness for sacrifice for the homeland.

고향으로 돌아 돌아갑시다
						가람
강남 갔든 제비도
넷집을 찾어 오고
묵은 남기 꽃 피는
붐은 봄으로 돌아옵니다
우리도 우리 고향으로
돌아가아 봅시다

고향을 돌아간대야
반길 이 뉘 있을까만
쑥대밭 같은 녯 터에
장치는 독갑이 떼도
우리 돌아가야만
슬어질까 함니다

그러나 님은 아시리다
제게 무엇이 있으리까
울기나 하려도
소리낼 힘이나 있으리까
빩안한 몸둥이 밖에
받힐 것이 없소이다＜51＞
