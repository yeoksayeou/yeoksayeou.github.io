Hamhŭng Music Association Anthem
						Hwang Un (Lyrics), Composition Department (Music)

1. In the clear water currents of the gently flowing Sŏngch'ŏn River (城川江),
The place where ancient lords rode horses, Pallyong Mountain (盤龍山), reflects upside down.
Beneath the refreshing breeze over the river and the bright moonlight on the mountain birds,
The quietly seated Hamhŭng (咸興) fortress, let us sing of it!
Brothers of Hamhŭng! Let us all rise and sing of nature.
Let our Music Association (樂友會) raise its voice and sing of Great Nature.
Hamhŭng Fortress, let us sing! Hamhŭng Fortress, let us sing!

2. While the wide fields suffer in darkness,
And the mountains and rivers lose their old light, standing wretchedly bare,
Our Music Association will ring the bell of peace.
Our Music Association will conquer the darkness.
Brothers of Hamhŭng! Let us all rise and sing of the light.
Let our Music Association raise its voice and sing of eternal peace.
Hamhŭng Fortress, let us sing! Hamhŭng Fortress, let us sing!

3. The place where roses bloom in the empty courtyard is our Music Association.
The spring flowing in the desert, an "oasis" (「오아씨쓰」), is our Music Association.
In the rough wilderness, flowers of joy will bloom.
In suffering life, flowers of comfort will bloom.
Brothers of Hamhŭng! Let us all rise and sing a song of joy.
Let our Music Association raise its voice and sing a song of joy.
Hamhŭng Fortress, let us sing! Hamhŭng Fortress, let us sing!

**Summary**

This text presents the lyrics for the Hamhŭng Music Association Anthem, written in 1927. The song praises the natural beauty and history surrounding Hamhŭng, calls for the association members ("Brothers of Hamhŭng") to sing together, expresses a hope to overcome darkness and suffering with peace and light, and posits the Music Association as a source of joy and comfort, like an oasis or blooming roses in a harsh environment. From a historical perspective, the anthem is interesting as an example of local cultural organization and expression during the Japanese colonial period. While overtly focused on nature, peace, and music, the references to "darkness," "suffering," and the desire for "light" and "peace" could be interpreted as subtle expressions of longing for liberation or improvement under oppressive circumstances, channeled through acceptable cultural activities. The focus on local identity (Hamhŭng) and collective action ("Brothers," "Our Music Association") is also noteworthy.

咸興樂友會 會歌
						黃雲(作歌), 作曲部(作曲)
1. 잔잔히 흐르는 城川江 맑은 물ㅅ결에
옛님군 말달리던 터 盤龍山 걱구로 빛외일쩌
강 위에 청풍과 산새에 밝은 달빛 아레
고요히 앉았는 함흥성 노래하리로다
咸興의 형제여 다 일어나 자연을 노래합시다.
우리의 樂友會 소리 높여서 大自然을 노래하세.
咸興城아 노래하세 咸興城아 노래하세.

2. 넓은 뜰 암흑에 괴롬을 받고 있으며
산천은 옛빛을 잃고 비참히 헐벗고 서 있을 때
우리의 樂友會 평화의 종을 울리겠네
우리의 樂友會 암흑을 정복하리로다
咸興의 兄弟여 다 일어나 광명을 노래합시다.
우리의 樂友會 소리 높여서 永遠한 평화를 노래해
咸興城아 노래하세 咸興城아 노래하세.

3. 빈 뜰에 장미화 피는 곳 우리 樂友會
사막에 흐르는 샘물 「오아씨쓰」 우리의 樂友會ㄹ세
거츨은 광야에 기뿜의 꽃이 피리로다
괴롭은 인생에 위안의 꽃이 피리로다.
咸興의 兄弟여 다 일어나 기뿜의 노래 부르세.
우리의 樂友會 소리 높여서 기뿜의 노래를 부르세
咸興城아 노래하세 咸興城아 노래하세.
