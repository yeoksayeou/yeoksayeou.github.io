Songdo Higher Normal School School Song,
						Yi Sangch'un (Lyricist)

1. In the thousand-year ancient capital (古都),
With fine mountains and waters, and deep history,
The grounds our school possesses (占領한 터)
Are bedrock (磐石).
Like the morning sky's sunlight (해빛),
Oh Songdo (松都), Songdo!
Be the light, your light,
Across land and sea, East and West.

2. Social service (社會奉事), our motto (標語),
We set it before us,
Let us advance on the path of learning
Tenaciously (억척스럽게).

3. Cultural construction (文化建設), your mission (使命),
Is great and heavy.
Though winds blow and rains beat down,
Fight on continuously (줄곳 싸우라).

4. With high ideals (理想) and firm will (意志),
Sturdy youth (健兒) of the Peninsula (半島)!
Pioneer (開拓하라) your life (生命)
With your own hands.
Songdo Higher Normal School Yi Kwan-yŏng <57>

**Summary**

This text presents the lyrics for the school song of Songdo Higher Normal School, written by Yi Sangch'un. The song praises the school's location in the historic city of Songdo (Kaesŏng), emphasizes its foundational strength, and exhorts students to pursue learning tenaciously, dedicate themselves to social service, undertake the mission of cultural construction, and pioneer their futures with high ideals and strong will as the youth of the Korean peninsula. From a historical perspective, the song reflects the educational aspirations and values promoted during the Japanese colonial period, blending pride in Korean history (千年 古都) and geography with modern ideals like social service and cultural development. The call to the "Sturdy youth of the Peninsula" to "pioneer your life" hints at a desire for progress and self-determination within the constraints of the era, making it interesting for historians studying expressions of Korean identity and ambition under colonial rule.

1. 山水 좋고 歷史 깊은
