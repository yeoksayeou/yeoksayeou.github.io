Gathering Wild Greens
						Kim T'aeo

Spring haze like silk threads
Hangs on the distant mountain ridges,

The young wife next door, the daughter from behind,
Are going to gather fresh wild greens,

But our home's child, holding only a hoe,
Sits beneath the fence, what are they digging? <55>

**Summary**

This short poem depicts a gentle spring scene. While the young women of the neighborhood are actively heading out to gather seasonal wild greens ('namul'), a common activity, the speaker observes their own young child sitting alone by the fence, seemingly preoccupied with digging with a small hoe ('homi'), their purpose unclear. The poem contrasts the communal, purposeful activity of the women with the solitary, perhaps whimsical, action of the child. From a historical perspective, the poem offers a glimpse into everyday rural life in colonial Korea, highlighting the seasonal practice of foraging for sustenance (namul gathering). The simple imagery and the focus on domestic figures (women, child) provide insight into common activities and perhaps subtle social observations of the time, which could interest social historians studying gender roles, community life, and childhood during this period.

비단실 같은 봄아랑이는
멀ㄴ 산 중얼에 걸리었는데
앞 집 새악씨 뒷 집 따님은
풋 나물 캐러 가는구마는
우리 집 아가 호미만 쥐고
울 밑에 앉아 무엇을 파나＜55＞
