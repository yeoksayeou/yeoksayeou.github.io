Sun
						Cho Un

Before that awesome face,
How dare I lift my head?
In that blinding ray of light,
I cannot even open my eyes.
As you speak no words,
I am even more afraid.

You whom I cannot even look at directly,
Why did I long for you so?
My being shy like this,
Would you truly call it wrong?
Sitting turned away, head bowed,
I only offer my back.

Though you, Beloved, are ancient,
Your light is ever new!
Though the great Earth (大地) is all worn out,
Its breath (呼吸) is fragrance (香氣)!
The heart born within that bosom
Throbs rapidly.

-27. New Year's Day (正初)- <51>

**Summary**

This poem by Cho Un expresses deep reverence and awe towards the sun, personified as a silent, powerful, and intimidating beloved ("님"). The speaker feels unworthy to look directly at the sun's overwhelming presence and light, turning away in shyness and fear. Despite the sun's ancient nature, its light brings constant renewal, making even the old Earth fragrant and causing the speaker's heart, born from this life-giving force, to beat strongly. From a historical perspective, the poem's intense focus on a powerful, life-giving natural element like the sun, described with such reverence during the colonial period, might be interpreted by historians as a subtle expression of yearning for national vitality or renewal, channeling potentially restricted nationalistic feelings into nature worship. It also reflects literary trends focusing on nature and lyricism during that time.

해
						曹雲
어마한 그 얼굴에
감히 고개 들으리까
부시는 그 빛살에
눈도 뜨지 못하리다
말씀도 없으시오니
더욱 두럽사외다.

바로 보도 못하올 님
어쩌자고 그렸던고
수좁아 이리함을
외다고야 하시오리
돌앉아 머리 죽인 채
잔둥이만 댑니다.

님은 옛이시되
빛은 매양 새론지고
다- 낡은 大地언만
呼吸이 香氣롤사
그 품에 태여난 마음
후둑후둑 함니다.
