The electric light is bright,
Attaching line to line,
A single spider.

Along the lines it rides,
Going up and down,
Working even at night. <71>

**Summary**

This short children's poem describes a spider diligently spinning its web under a bright electric light, continuing its work even at night. The poem uses simple language suitable for children. From a historical perspective, the mention of an "electric light" (전긔ㅅ불) indicates the presence of modern technology in 1927 Korea. The theme of the spider working diligently ("밤에도 일하네") could potentially reflect broader societal values or expectations emphasized during the colonial period, although presented here in an innocent context. The older orthography used (e.g., 전긔ㅅ불) is also of linguistic interest to historians studying language change.
