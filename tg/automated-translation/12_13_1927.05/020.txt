How fleeting is time! Already one year has passed.
As barley wine ripens and mountain greens become tasty,
Friend, raise your glass and wish a long life for this birthday.

Even as one year becomes two, three, a hundred, a thousand years,
May the spirit and strength remain constant, eternally unchanging.
Friend, raise your hand and make a firm pledge.

When will that feast we await, awake or asleep, arrive?
The sound of the angel's trumpet may soon be heard even here.
Friend, raise your voice and shout long live His Majesty! <1>

**Summary**

This poem, titled "Toljanch'ae" (First Birthday Feast), uses the occasion of a first birthday to reflect on the passage of time and express hopes for the future. The poet urges friends to celebrate the milestone and wishes for the subject's spirit and strength to remain eternally unchanging through countless years. The final stanza expresses anticipation for a future "feast" heralded by an "angel's trumpet," concluding with a call to cheer "long live." For historians, the poem is interesting as it blends a personal celebration with potent themes of endurance, longevity ("eternally unchanging," "hundred, thousand years"), and fervent anticipation for a significant future event ("angel's trumpet"), potentially reflecting veiled nationalistic sentiments or aspirations for a brighter future under colonial rule. The concluding "숭호 만세" (Long live His Majesty) is ambiguous; it could be a conventional closing for the era or hold a deeper, perhaps ironic or coded, meaning depending on the broader context of the magazine and author (if known).

돌잔채
덧없다 세월이여 발서 한돌 되었고너
보리술 한창 피고 산채도 맛들 때니
벗님아 잔을 들어서 생일 축수하여라.

한돌로 두돌 세돌 백천돌 닿아와도
얼과 힘 한결같이 영시불변하을 것이
벗님아 손을 들어서 굳이 맹서하여랴.

자고깨고 기다리는 그 잔채란 언제 올꼬
천사의 나팔소리 하마 예도 들리려니
벗님아 소리 높여서 숭호 만세하소라. ＜1＞
