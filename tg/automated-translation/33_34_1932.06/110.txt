**Summary**

This article presents a ten-question mock "Modern University Entrance Exam" published in the Korean magazine *Tonggwang* in 1932. Each question is worth one point, with grading criteria provided. The questions cover a range of topics including Korean history (Tan'gun, Hunminjŏngŭm), Korean and regional geography (Ch'ŏngsong, Bukgando, Kilhoe Railway), international politics and figures (Three Principles of the People, Kemal Pasha, Geneva), and basic science/general knowledge (celluloid flammability, metric conversion). The magazine also invites readers to submit their own questions. For historians, this piece offers insight into the perceived scope of general knowledge expected of educated Koreans during the colonial period, blending national history and geography with awareness of contemporary international affairs (China, Turkey, Europe) and practical knowledge like the metric system's relation to traditional units. The inclusion of questions about Tan'gun, Hunminjŏngŭm, and Bukgando specifically highlights areas pertinent to Korean national identity and territorial awareness within the context of Japanese rule.
