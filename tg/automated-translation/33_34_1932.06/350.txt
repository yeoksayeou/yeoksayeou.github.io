Ode to Autumn in the Countryside
						Kim Su-yŏng

Where rice paddies and fields touch each other in the distant fields,
Golden hues and myriad colors ripple blown by the wind;
My heart feels content, as if bursting with fullness.<83>

Driving the ox to plow the field, sowing seeds, weeding the kimchi plot,
Children chasing birds appear and disappear beyond the embankment.
A chicken seeking feed under the fence announces it is midday.

Bean vines cover the field, and rice ears cover the paddy ridges.
Wandering here and there along the paths of paddies and fields in this plain,
Sorghum leaves rustle in the wind and brush past my forehead.

At midnight the moon is bright, making the whole village like day.
A sheet of cloud covers the moon, then slowly reveals it, leisurely;
In the crevices of the stones, crickets chirp, chirp-chirp.

The moon is bright, the night deepens, boundless in its quietude.
The sound of cloth-smoothing fills this house and that, bustling;
Beside the wall, a few yellow chrysanthemums smile, bathed in moonlight.
-Having come to my hometown-<84>

**Summary**

This poem by Kim Su-yŏng paints a serene and idyllic picture of autumn in the Korean countryside. It describes the golden fields ready for harvest, the sounds and sights of rural life like plowing, children playing, chickens, crickets chirping, and the rhythmic pounding of cloth smoothing under a bright moonlit night. The poem evokes a sense of peace, abundance, and nostalgic connection to the author's hometown. From a historical perspective, the poem is interesting as it was published in 1932 during the Japanese colonial period. Its focus on the beauty and tranquility of the traditional Korean landscape and rural life, devoid of overt political commentary or depictions of hardship, might reflect a form of escapism or perhaps a subtle assertion of Korean cultural identity rooted in the land amidst colonial pressures. Historians might find the poem useful for understanding cultural expressions and sentiments during this era.

田園秋頌
						金壽永
논과 밭 서로다아 까마득한 이들옄에
누른빛 다한 빛을 바람불어 출렁거려
배절로 부러지는 듯 마음푸근 하오라＜83＞

소몰아 밭을 갈고 씨를 뿌려 김장심소
새쫓는 아이들 뚝넘어로 뵈다말다
울밑에 모이찾는 닭 한낮됨을 일러라

콩넝쿨 밭을 덮고 벼이삭은 논뚝덮소
이들역 논길 밭길 이리저리 그닐러니
수수닢 바람에 불러 이마스처 가더라

한밤중 달은 밝아 온마을이 낮같소라
구름장 달 가렷다 벗겨 젓다 한가하이
돌 틈에 귀뜰아미는 귀뚤귀뚤 울더라

달 밝고 밤은 깊어 고요하기 끝없노니
다듬질 하는 소리 이집저집 요란하이
담옆에 황국몇송이 달빛비껴 웃더라
-고향에 왓다가- ＜84＞
＜83-84＞
