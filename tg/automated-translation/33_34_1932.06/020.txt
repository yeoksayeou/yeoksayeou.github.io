(Top) Aiming for the International Olympics - From the right, Messrs. Kwŏn T'aeha, Kim Ŭnbae, and Son Kijŏng went on an expedition to Tokyo aiming for the International Olympics. Messrs. Kwŏn and Kim took 1st and 2nd place in the marathon, securing their spots as dispatched athletes!

(Bottom) The Strong Legs of the Yangjŏng Team - The Yangjŏng High Common School (養正高普軍) team, winners of the All-Japan Middle School Tokyo-Yokohama Round Trip Relay Race (全日本中等學校 東京橫濱間往復驛傳競走).

**Summary**

This news brief celebrates two Korean athletic achievements. Firstly, it reports that marathon runners Kwŏn T'aeha and Kim Ŭnbae secured the top two spots in a qualifying race in Tokyo, confirming their selection for the "International Olympics" (likely the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics). Son Kijŏng also participated in the expedition. Secondly, it announces the victory of the Yangjŏng High Common School team in the All-Japan Middle School Tokyo-Yokohama Relay Race. From a colonial history perspective, the article is interesting as it highlights Korean sporting prowess ("Sports Chosŏn Manse!") even while competing within the framework of the Japanese empire (qualifying in Tokyo, winning an "All-Japan" race). It showcases Korean pride and identity expressed through sports during a period of occupation, where athletes officially represented Japan but were celebrated as Korean heroes back home.
