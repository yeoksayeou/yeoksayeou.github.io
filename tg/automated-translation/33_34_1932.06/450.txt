**Summary**

This brief announcement from the Tonggwang Company (東光社), publisher of the Tonggwang magazine, informs readers of the appointment of two new special correspondents: Kwak Tong-sŏk covering all of Korea and Chŏn Ch'un-sik covering the Kyŏngwŏn railway line area. It also announces the establishment of two new branch offices in Choaktong (Kusŏng County) and Sariwŏn, naming the individuals responsible for each. From a historical perspective, this notice reveals the magazine's efforts to expand its network and reach across Korea in 1932, highlighting specific personnel and geographical areas (including northern regions like Kusŏng and Sariwŏn) deemed important for its operations during the colonial period. The appointment of correspondents along a major railway line (Kyŏngwŏn Line) also indicates the significance of transportation networks for information gathering and distribution.
