New Year's Morning
						O Il-to

New Year's Morning
This body, sick all winter long
It's the New Year, so I climb the mountain<84>
Perhaps because it's the New Year I've longed for, even the sunbeams are warm
It seems even flowers might bloom on the dry branches.

I miss my distant comrades
When this body's illness heals
And flowers bloom on this mountain
Every day, climbing this mountain
Shall I just gaze up at the blue sky?
(Written climbing Kyesan on the morning of the first day of the Lunar New Year)

Temptation of Water

The water of the Han River ripples and surges
The spring of the Han River is blue.

The willows sleeping by the ferry landing rustle and open their eyes
The boats trapped in the ice also depart.

In spring, the water begins to move
The temptation of water (물의 誘惑) is in the spring.

That blue water
Seems as if it might be bottomless, thousands, tens of thousands of fathoms deep.

Like the country drawn in my childhood mind
My heart wants to go in again and again.
1932, 2, 2 By the Han River <85>

**Summary**

The document presents two poems by O Il-to. The first, "New Year's Morning," expresses a sense of hope and renewal found in nature after a period of illness, coinciding with the Lunar New Year. The speaker longs for recovery, the return of spring, and reunification with friends, finding solace in the simple act of observing nature from a mountain. The second poem, "Temptation of Water," depicts the vibrant energy of the Han River in spring, portraying the water as alluring and mysteriously deep, evoking a sense of longing and a connection to childhood imagination. From a historical perspective, these poems are interesting as they showcase personal lyricism focused on nature, illness, and longing during the Japanese colonial period. While not overtly political, the focus on the Korean landscape (Kyesan, Han River) and personal resilience (recovering from illness, enduring winter) might subtly reflect a turning inward or finding strength in enduring natural cycles amidst difficult external circumstances. The use of older Korean orthography is also of linguistic interest.

새해아침
						吳一島
새해아침
한 겨울 앓던 이몸
새해라 山에 오르니＜84＞
새해라 그려온지 해ㅅ발도 따스고나
마른가지에 곳 꽃도 필듯하네.

멀리 잇는 동모가 그리워요
이몸에 病이 낫고
이 山에 꽃 피거든
날마다 이 山에 올라
파-란 하눌이나 치어다 볼까.
(舊正月 초하루 아침 桂山에 올라서)

물의 誘惑
漢江의 물은 일렁일렁 합니다
漢江의 봄은 파랏습니다.

나루가에 자든 버들 바스락 눈을 뜨고
어름속에 갇혓든 배도 떠나 갑니다.

봄에 물은 움직이기 시작합니다
물의 유혹은 봄에 잇습니다.

파-란 저 물
천길 만길 밑도 없는 듯 싶습니다.

어린날 머리속에 그리든 나라 같아서
내 마음 작고 들어가 보고 싶습니다.
