Thoughts of Autumn in July
						Cho Ui-hyŏn

On the streets, straw hats (麥藁帽) and white shoes
Are perfectly in season, all the rage,
And at the ice water shop (氷水店), customers
Stream in and out without cease...

Since it's my mood taking me,
What could I possibly say about it?

Look at the sky?
Isn't it much higher?
And then,
A poplar leaf,
Ripened yellow like a quince (木果),
Falls as if discarded!

Last autumn—
At Changch'ungdan, the sound
Of dry leaves rolling, rustling and bustling,
Comes familiarly to my ears,
As if from about 30 *ri* away,
Autumn were hesitating, wondering whether to come or not.
(Old Work) <84>

**Summary**

This poem by Cho Ui-hyŏn, published in June 1932, contrasts the bustling summer scene, marked by seasonal fashion and busy shops, with the poet's introspective thoughts turning towards autumn. Despite the peak of summer, the poet observes subtle signs, like a high sky and a falling poplar leaf, that evoke memories and feelings of the coming fall, specifically recalling the sounds of dry leaves at Changch'ungdan the previous year. For historians, the poem offers a glimpse into urban life and seasonal sensibilities in colonial Seoul. The mention of Changch'ungdan, a place originally established to honor Korean loyalists, within this seemingly apolitical reflection on seasons, might subtly hint at underlying national sentiment or nostalgia during a period of Japanese rule, contrasting modern, perhaps Western-influenced, summer imagery with a site tied to Korean history.

七月에 가을생각
						曹宜鉉
거리에는 麥藁帽 화일슈-스가
때맞혀 한창이고
氷水店엔 손님이
끊이지 않게 드나들건만...

내키는 내 맘이니
낸들 무어라리요만

하눌을 보아요?
훨신 높지 않은가
그리자
노랗게 모과(木果)처럼 익은
포플라 잎 하나이
내버리듯이 떨어지는구려!

작년 가을-
獎忠壇에서 마른 나무잎이
바스락 부스럭 구르는 소리가
귀에 익숙이도 들려오며
마치 한 30里밖에서
가을이 올까 올까
주츰거리는 것 같어라.
