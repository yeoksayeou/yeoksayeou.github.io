**Body Text Translation:**
Whither Ch'ŏndogyo, Leaders of the Re-Split New and Old Factions

(Middle) The Ch'ŏndogyo Central Temple in Kyŏngun-dong (慶雲洞), which embodies the split between the New and Old Factions (新舊 兩派分裂).

**Summary**

This article appears to report on a renewed schism within Ch'ŏndogyo, a significant Korean religion, focusing on the leaders ("bigwigs") of the conflicting "New" and "Old" factions. It features images of the religion's late third patriarch, Son Pyŏnghŭi, and the Ch'ŏndogyo Central Temple in Seoul's Kyŏngun-dong, presented as a symbol of this internal division. For historians, this snippet highlights the internal struggles and factionalism within major Korean nationalist and religious organizations like Ch'ŏndogyo during the Japanese colonial period, reflecting the pressures and challenges faced by Korean society under colonial rule.
