Weaver Girl's Lament
						Kwak Chong-su

Weaver Girl's Lament
Have you seen the falling blossoms tremble in the wild wind?
They drift along so well, hey ho, following the flowing water.
Even if my features are fine, and I weave hemp cloth well,
Spring too is almost gone, yet there is no word.

Oh, Falling Blossoms
Falling blossoms, though you drift vainly following the flowing water,
Though I may look like this, I am but a country girl.
Even if I die right away, I hate that Seoul gentleman, indeed.
When the sun sets and darkness spreads, I will surely return home.<100>

**Summary**

These two short poems by Kwak Chong-su present lyrical expressions of female sentiment. "Weaver Girl's Lament" uses the mythological figure of Jingnyeo (the Weaver Girl) to voice disappointment and longing, observing nature's course (falling blossoms, passing spring) while waiting fruitlessly for news. "Oh, Falling Blossoms" contrasts the speaker, a steadfast country girl, with the aimlessly drifting blossoms, asserting her rejection of a presumably undesirable suitor from the city ("Seoul gentleman") and her commitment to her own place. For historians, these poems offer a glimpse into expressions of female interiority, the enduring symbolism of classical myths, the perceived tension between rural simplicity and urban sophistication (or corruption), and perhaps subtle expressions of resilience or resistance within the social constraints of the time.

織女嘆
광풍에 떨니는 낙화를 보앗나
유수 따라 얼시구 잘만 가든걸
인물이 굳다해도 배 잘 짜건만
올 봄도 다 가는대 말이 없구나

落花야
낙화야 부질없어 유수 따라도
이 몸은 이래뵈나 시골 처녀ㄴ걸
곳 죽어도 장안 샌님 나는 싫다나
해지면 깔지고 도라올테지＜100＞
