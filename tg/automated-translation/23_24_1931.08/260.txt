Willow Shade
						Muae

Wife—Lately, she repeatedly discusses wanting to wear Western clothes. Smiling, I write and show her this piece.

Dressed up fancy in Western clothes, where would you go?
Aren't all the white-clad people of the three thousand *ri* nearly naked?
Isn't showing off tasteless? To whom would you boast?

If your figure is good, isn't cotton clothing neat and charming?
For your smallish height, the *ch'ima chŏgori* is quite suitable,
Why insist on wearing rayon Western clothes?

Going out onto the main street, you look surprisingly modern,
But entering our humble house (塞屋), you are the wife of a poor scholar (貧士).
I look at the Western-dressed beauty before the kitchen hearth (*agung*) and laugh.
(September 1st) <54>

**Summary**

This short, three-stanza poem humorously addresses the author's wife's desire to wear Western clothing ("yangbok"). The author, writing under the pen name Muae ("Boundless"), contrasts this desire with their modest means ("poor scholar," "humble house") and the general poverty of Koreans under colonial rule ("white-clad people... nearly naked"). He argues that traditional Korean attire (*ch'ima chŏgori*, cotton) is more suitable for her figure and their situation, finding amusement in the image of a "Western-dressed beauty" standing before a traditional kitchen hearth. From a historical perspective, the poem reflects the tensions between tradition and modernity in 1930s Korea, particularly concerning clothing as a symbol of status and identity. It offers a glimpse into the economic realities faced by many Koreans ("poor scholar," "nearly naked") and subtly critiques ostentatious displays (wearing expensive Western clothes) in a time of widespread hardship, hinting at a quiet form of nationalism or cultural conservatism.

버드나무 그늘
						無涯
妻-근래에 양복을 입겟노라 누누히 의논하는지라. 웃으며 이 글을 써 보이다.

양복을 떨처 입고 어느 곧에 가려느뇨,
삼천리 흰 옷 무리 모다 아니 헐벗은가,
자랑도 운치 아니랴, 뉘게 자랑 하리오.

몸매사 좋을시면 무명 아니 아담한가,
작으만 그대 키엔 치마 저골 알맞아를,
굳하여 인견 양복을 입어 무삼 하리오.

나서매 한길 우에 모던인양 놀랍더니,
塞屋에 들어서니 貧士님의 안핼러라.
아궁 앞 양장 麗人을 바라보고 웃노라.
