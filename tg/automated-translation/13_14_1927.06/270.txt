**Summary**

This biographical entry from June 1927 outlines the personal details and career path of Yi Sang-hyŏp (pen name Hamong), the Managing Editor of the Chungoe Ilbo newspaper. Born in Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul) in 1892 to a former official, Yi graduated from Posŏng Middle School in 1910 and immediately began a career in journalism at the Maeil Sinbo. He later held high-level positions at the Tonga Ilbo and Chosŏn Ilbo before becoming Managing Editor at the Chungoe Ilbo in 1926. He also authored novels, including *Tears* and *Neptune*. For historians, this profile is valuable as it documents the career trajectory of a prominent Korean journalist moving between major newspapers (Maeil Sinbo, Tonga Ilbo, Chosŏn Ilbo, Chungoe Ilbo) during the Japanese colonial period. His movement between these publications, which often had differing editorial stances and relationships with the colonial authorities, offers insight into the complex media landscape and potential political navigation required by Korean intellectuals and professionals at the time.
