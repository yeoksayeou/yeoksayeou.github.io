**Summary**

This biographical entry from 1927 outlines the background of Sin Sŏk-u (pen name Chach'ang), the Executive Director of the Chosŏn Ilbo newspaper. Born in Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul) in 1895, he graduated from Hwimun Ŭisuk Middle School and Waseda University (Political Science and Economics) in Japan. He held positions at the Chosŏn Ilbo since 1923 and was also the General Secretary of the Political and Cultural Department of the Singanhoe. For historians, this brief profile is valuable as it highlights a member of the Korean elite during the colonial period who received modern education both domestically and in Japan, pursued a career in the influential Korean media (Chosŏn Ilbo), and was actively involved in the prominent nationalist united front organization, the Singanhoe, indicating the intersection of journalism, education, and nationalist activities among certain segments of Korean society under Japanese rule.
