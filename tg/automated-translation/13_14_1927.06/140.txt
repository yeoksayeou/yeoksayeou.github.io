I cannot go, I cannot go
On a back like a ridgepole (새등)
Carrying a load like Mount T'ae (태산)
Down a road bent like a bow's spine (활등)
Like a clumsy ox (설대), I cannot go

I cannot go, I cannot go
Putting my young sibling ahead
My legs tremble, I cannot go
The path tangled with thorn bushes
Like a burn victim (화상), I cannot go<31>

**Summary**

This folk song, collected by Chŏn Chonghwan and published in 1927, expresses deep hardship and the feeling of being overwhelmed by life's burdens. Using vivid similes (a back like a ridgepole, a load like a mountain, a road like a bow), the speaker laments their inability to proceed, weighed down physically and emotionally, also mentioning the responsibility of caring for a younger sibling on a treacherous path. From a historical perspective, the poem offers a glimpse into the difficult lives of ordinary people in rural Korea (specifically Gapyeong) during the 1920s. The imagery of immense burdens and impassable roads could reflect the economic hardships and social pressures of the colonial period, even without explicitly mentioning them. The act of collecting and publishing regional folk songs like this in a magazine such as *Tonggwang* was also significant, representing an effort to preserve and value Korean vernacular culture amidst colonial assimilation policies.
