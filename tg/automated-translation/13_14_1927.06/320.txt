Idle Talk Amidst Busyness

Seventeen-Character Composition

Come now, gather 'round everyone. Don't just read the scholars' treatises (論文); let's pass the time with some miscellaneous talk (雜談) too.
Since I brought up the topic, I'll start with a word first.

Once upon a time, they say there was a talented child (才童) who was good at composing poems with seventeen characters (열일곱字). One day, while parting with his one-eyed uncle on a stone bridge (돌ㅅ다리), poetic inspiration (詩想) suddenly struck him, and he recited a verse:

*On the stone bridge in the spring wind, the feeling of my uncle seeing me off.*
*Two people face each other weeping, three lines.* (三人이 相對泣하니 三行)

"Hey, you brat! Just because your uncle is blind in one eye, is that any proper behavior (當한 버릇)?"
The uncle, bursting with anger (怒發大發), reported him to the government office (官家) and had him thrown in jail (下獄), so the story goes.

Just then, as the drought (旱魃) was severe, the county magistrate (郡守) was performing a rain-praying ritual (祈雨祭). The boy composed another poem and respectfully presented (進呈) it.
The poem said:

*The County Magistrate performs the rain ritual, black clouds cover the white sun.*
*But sincerity was still insufficient (猶不足), the sun came out.* (日出)

Now the County Magistrate's hair stood on end in rage (怒髮이 衝冠). He had the boy brought into the East Hall (東軒) courtyard and, under a command as stern as autumn frost (秋霜같은 호령), struck his buttocks seventeen times (볼기짝을 열아문番 갈기었더니).

"Owowow! Hold on a moment! I'll compose a poem."

*Each time I compose seventeen characters (十七字), I get whipped seventeen times (笞得十七度).*
*If I were to make seventeen phrases (十七句), would I be beaten to death (打殺)?*

"What an incorrigible fellow!"
Everyone hahaha.

Thousand-Character Classic Composition

While we're at it, let's do another one. This time it's a story about the Thousand-Character Classic (千字文章).

Once upon a time, there was the daughter of a certain high minister's (정승) house. When it came to the Thousand-Character Classic, from "Heaven and Earth are dark and yellow" (自天地玄黃) right up to the final particles "Eon Jae Ho Ya" (至於焉哉乎也), there was nothing she didn't understand (無所不通); she was truly a great female scholar (女流大文章), they say.

So, in her grand advertisement recruiting a groom (新郞募集 大廣告), it said:
"He who knows the Thousand-Character Classic (千字文章) is my match (吾之配匹也)!"
Bachelors (總角) from all Eight Provinces (八道) rushed forward, all claiming, "I know the Thousand-Character Classic!" One day, this young woman was squatting down (쪼끄리고 앉아서) and said, looking at a certain bachelor:
"What do I look like?"

"Pictures of birds and beasts!" (圖寫禽獸!)

"Hey! You strange fellow! I am 'Colorfully painted spirits and immortals' (畵彩仙靈)! Throw this brat out!"

Being chased out, he thought, 'Resentment could not be greater (怨痛莫甚)!' So, this bachelor stood leaning against the wall, getting soaked by the pouring (좔좔 퍼붓는) rain. Just then (때마츰), a guest came by and asked:
"Why are you standing there (웨 거긔 서었느냐)?"

So, thinking, 'Well, let me try explaining my situation (陳情) to this nobleman (兩班),' he said:

"For the crime of having said 'Pictures of birds and beasts' (圖寫禽獸) when I should have said 'Colorfully painted spirits and immortals' (畵彩仙靈), on this night when 'clouds rise to make rain' (雲騰致雨), I 'attach my ear to the fence wall' (屬耳垣墻) [i.e., eavesdrop]."

"My goodness! This fellow truly knows the Thousand-Character Classic!"
The young woman also heard these words.
"Truly, this is my man (果是 吾郞)!" she said, satisfied in her heart (於心에).<60>

**Summary**

This article presents two humorous anecdotes centered around wordplay and classical Chinese texts. The first tells of a witty boy whose poems, ending with literal interpretations ("three lines" of tears, "sun came out"), anger his one-eyed uncle and a county magistrate, leading to punishment but showcasing his quick wit even under duress. The second story involves a highly educated noblewoman seeking a husband proficient in the Thousand-Character Classic; a initially rejected suitor proves his mastery by cleverly describing his predicament using only phrases from the classic text, ultimately winning her approval. For historians, these stories offer insights into the cultural importance and popular awareness of classical Chinese education (like the Cheonjamun) in 1920s Korea, even in humorous contexts. They also subtly touch upon social hierarchies (magistrates, nobles, commoners) and traditional matchmaking, all while using humor that plays on literalism and classical literacy.

忙中閑談
十七字文章
자, 이리들 오시오. 학자님의 論文만 보시지 말고 우리 雜談도 하면서 지납시다.
發論을 내가 내이었으니 위선 내가 한 마디 하지요.
예전에 열일곱字 가지고 詩 잘 짓는 才童이 있었더랍니다. 어느 날 돌ㅅ다리 우에서 외통삼촌과 작별을 하다가 갑작히 詩想이 大發하여 한 首 부르는데
春風石橋上에 叔父送我情이라 兩人이 相對泣하니 三行.
『엑 요놈 아무리 삼촌이 한 눈이 멀었기루써 그게 어대 當한 버릇이냐.』
삼촌은 怒發大發하여 官家에 告訴를 하고 잡아다가 下獄을 시키었더랍니다.
때 마침 旱魃이 자심한지라 郡守님이 祈雨祭를 지나시는데 또 한번 詩를 지어서 鄭重하게 進呈하였더랍니다.
詩에 曰
郡守 祈雨祭하니 黑雲이 蔽白日이라 정성이 猶不足하여 日出.
이제는 郡守가 怒髮이 衝冠하여 東軒 뜰에 잡아들이어다가 놓고 秋霜같은 호령 하에 볼기짝을 열아문番 갈기었더니
『아구구 잠간만 참으슈. 내 詩 하나 짓겟소.』
每作十七字하고 笞得十七度하니 若作十七句면 打殺가.
『할 수 없는 놈이로다.』
一同 하하하.

千字文章
하던 김이라 또 하나 하지요. 이제는 千字文章 이야기ㄴ데
예전에 어느 정승집 처녀가 있는데 千字로 말하면 自天地玄黃으로 至於焉哉乎也히 無所不通하는 그야말로 女流大文章이더랍니다.
그래 新郞募集 大廣告에 曰
『千字文章이면 吾之配匹也라!』 하였더니 八道總角이 皆是曰 千字文章이라고 덤뷔는 판인데 어느 날 이 처녀가 쪼끄리고 앉아서 어느 총각을 보고 하는 말이
『내가 무엇 같으냐.』
『圖寫禽獸!』
『엑 고이한 놈 畵彩仙靈이지 이놈 쫓아내어라.』
쫓기어 나서 생각하니 怨痛莫甚이란 말이다! 그래 이 총각이 좔좔 퍼붓는 비를 맞으면서도 그냥 담벼락을 기대고서 있노라니까 때마츰 어느 손님이 오다가
『웨 거긔 서었느냐』고 뭇더랍니다. 그래
『에라 이 兩班께 陳情이나 한번 하여 보자』 하고
畵彩仙靈하올 것을 圖寫禽獸하온 죄로 雲騰致雨하는 밤에 屬耳垣墻하옵니다.
『야 이건 千字文章이로구나.』
처녀 역시 이 말을 듯고
『果是 吾郞이로다』 하고 於心에 만족하더랍니다.＜60＞
