Seoul
						Chŏng Pyŏng-sun

Seoul

Drunkenness and fighting,
What is this commotion?
Your Seoul
Is a playground
For a pack of goblins (독갑이).

No, my friend,
The silent workers
Are the guides for the future.
The Seoul of today
Is a Seoul shedding
Its empty shell.

Older Sister

One night by train,
Then another five hundred *ri* on foot.
Manchuria, that place,
Is where my older sister is.

My older sister,
Married off, sold for debt,
Shed cold tears
Seven years ago in the winter solstice month.

As I have no wings,
I cannot fly swiftly there.
Upon my pillow on a Seoul night,
Please come walking on the dream path.<32>

**Summary**

This work consists of two short poems. The first, "Seoul," presents a dialogue contrasting a view of the city as chaotic and decadent ("drunkenness," "fighting," "goblins' playground") with a hopeful perspective emphasizing the "silent workers" who are building the future and helping the city shed its superficial past. The second poem, "Older Sister," expresses deep sorrow and longing for a sister who was married off due to family debt and now lives far away in Manchuria, unreachable except perhaps in dreams. From a historical perspective, the poems reflect the social conditions of 1920s colonial Korea: the turbulent changes and perhaps perceived moral decay in the capital city, juxtaposed with faith in the working class, alongside the stark reality of poverty forcing families to sell daughters into marriage and causing migration to places like Manchuria. The theme of separation and longing due to economic hardship and distance is poignant.

						鄭昞淳
서울
주정이오 싸움이오
이 어인 야단이오
당신의 서울은
독갑이 떼의
작란터이구려.

아니라오 친구여
말 없는 일꾼이
앞날의 길잡이오
지금의 서울은
허울 벗는
서울이라네.

누님
긔차로 하로ㅅ밤
걸어서 또 오백리
만주라 그곳은
우리 누님 게신다오.

빗에 팔려 시집간
우리 누님은
칠년전 동짓달에
찬눈물 흘렷다오.

날개없는 몸이라
훨훨 날아 못가오니
서울ㅅ밤 비개우에
꿈ㅅ길 걸어오시오.＜32＞
