My Star
						Yuk Min-ch'ŏl

When I quietly look up at the sky,
Many stars are twinkling, twinkling, aren't they?
Older brother's star, younger sibling's star, older sister's star,
All the stars are twinkling, twinkling, aren't they?

But when the roosters crow often,
The many stars dimly fade away, don't they?
But my star alone is shining, isn't it?

In the dawn sky where all stars have faded,
My star alone is shining. <65>

**Summary**

This short poem by Yuk Min-ch'ŏl uses the simple imagery of stars in the night sky. The speaker observes the multitude of stars twinkling but notes that as dawn approaches and roosters crow, most stars fade away. However, the speaker's own star ("내 별") remains shining alone in the dawn sky. The poem speaks to a sense of individuality and endurance, contrasting the speaker's persistent star with the ephemeral nature of others. From a historical perspective, the poem, written during the Japanese colonial period, could subtly reflect themes of individual hope, resilience, or enduring identity ("my star") amidst changing times or the fading away of collective elements ("뭇별"). Historians might find interest in its gentle assertion of singularity and persistence during a period of external control.

내별
						陸敏哲
가만히 하늘을 치어다 보면은
뭇별이 반작반작 빛나고 있지요
형님 별 동생 별 누나의 별
모든 별이 반작반작 빛나고 있지요

그러나 닭들이 자주 울 때엔
뭇별이 히멀금 살아저 가지오
그러나 내 별만은 홀-로 빛나고 있지요

모든 별 살아진 새벽 하늘에
내 별만 홀-로 빛나고 있지요.＜65＞
