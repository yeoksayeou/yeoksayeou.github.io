The World's Great Landlord, the British Empire (Overseas Territories)

**Summary**

This article, based on its title, appears to be a news piece or informational item focusing on the vast extent of the British Empire's overseas territories, characterizing Britain as the "World's Great Landlord." From the perspective of Korean colonial history, this article is interesting as it reflects Korean awareness of and interest in global geopolitics and the nature of large empires during a period when Korea itself was a colony. It potentially offered readers a comparative framework, implicitly or explicitly, for understanding imperial power structures and territorial control, which directly impacted their own lives under Japanese rule.
