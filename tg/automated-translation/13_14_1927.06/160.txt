Song of a Mountain Maiden
						Ku Hyŏn

A heart truly longing,
Though I wander all day long,
The grassy field on the back hill
Gently calls me back, it’s my playground.
Though the world is wide, only turning,
Does the cuckoo (杜鵑) know my heart?
Every night, just looking at the sky,
The Big Dipper (北斗星) caught my eye, oh how I missed it.

The mountain cherries have reddened,
It seems as though you might have come,
Shall I become a swallow and fly away?
Day after day, only the sun sets, this sun sets again.

As I live in the mountains (山中),
I do not know the Han River's water (漢江水).
Hearing the words that Seoul is to the north,
What good does it do? It only wets my collar more.＜32＞

**Summary**

This poem, "Song of a Mountain Maiden" by Ku Hyŏn, expresses the deep longing and sense of isolation felt by a young woman living in the mountains. She wanders her familiar surroundings, like the grassy back hill, but feels a persistent yearning, symbolized by watching the Big Dipper at night. The changing seasons, marked by red mountain cherries, bring fleeting hope of a visitor, contrasted with the unchanging passage of days. The maiden explicitly states her detachment from the wider world, particularly Seoul and the Han River, noting that knowing about them only deepens her sorrow and sense of separation.

From a historical perspective, the poem subtly reflects the tension between rural isolation and the growing centrality of Seoul (Keijō/Kyŏngsŏng) during the colonial period. The maiden's lament about not knowing the Han River or Seoul, and the pain associated with just hearing about the capital, could symbolize the emotional distance and perhaps the perceived unobtainability of the modernizing urban center for those in the countryside, highlighting the social and geographical divides of the time.

山中處女의 노래
						九玄
참아나 그리운 마음
한종일 헤매어도
뒤ㅅ동산 잔듸밭이
곱돌아 드네 내 놀이터라네
세상이야 넓다 돌아만
杜鵑이는 내 속 아나
밤마다 하늘만 보면
北斗星이 눈 띄더라 그립더라.

산앵도 붉었으니
오신 듯도 하건마는
제비라 날아나 갈까,
나날이 해만 지네, 이 해 또 지네.

山中에 사는 몸이니
漢江水 내 몰은다네.
서울이 북쪽이란 말
들으면 무엇하오 옷깃만 더 적시지.＜32＞
