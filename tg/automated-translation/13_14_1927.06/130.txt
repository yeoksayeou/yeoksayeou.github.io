Folk Song
						Kim Sŏ-wŏl

A scholar from Sŏch'ŏn land
Took a wife in Miryang wŏn.
On the first night, the bride
Gave birth behind the folding screen.
The little chick cries "Kkangk-kkang,"
Demanding milk, cloudy milk.
Feed it without complaint.

Inside the room, the color of blood;
Above the door, a lotus flower.
Go down to the lower room,
Adult servant, prepare the journey!
Child servant, ready the horse!
Let's go back the way we came.

The father-in-law and mother-in-law quickly appear,
"Son-in-law, son-in-law, oh my son-in-law,
What is this talk of leaving?
Give us at least a word before you go."
"Ah, this wench, here is the word!
What is it? Yettwitwitwi!"
<31>

**Summary**

This poem, presented as a folk song from Kangwŏn Province by the renowned poet Kim Sŏ-wŏl, tells the surreal story of a scholar whose bride gives birth on their wedding night. Shocked, he prepares to leave immediately. When his in-laws ask for an explanation, his only response is a crude spitting sound, blaming their daughter. The poem captures a blend of folk narrative, dark humor, and perhaps social commentary on marriage or unexpected situations, expressed in older Korean vernacular. From a historical perspective, the publication of regional folk songs like this one during the Japanese colonial period (1910-1945) is significant. It represents an effort, whether conscious or unconscious, to preserve and document Korean cultural traditions and dialects at a time when national culture was under pressure. Historians might find it interesting as an example of cultural expression and preservation during that era, reflecting both traditional themes and the specific linguistic forms of the 1920s collected by a major literary figure.

民謠
						金曙月
西川땅에 시 선비가
密陽원에 장가 들어
첫 날밤에 각시님이
해산 햇네 평풍 넘어
봉예기는 젓 달라고
깡깡 우네 흔린 젓을
조롱말고 먹이게나

방 안에는 피빗이요
문 위에는 蓮花일셰
아랫방에 네리다러
어른종아 길 차리라
아이종아 말 도러라.
오든 길로 도로 가자

장인장모 썩 나스며
사위사위 이 내 사위
가단 말이 원 말인가
글말이나 주고 가게
에라 요년 글말이다
무엇이냐 옛튀튀튀
