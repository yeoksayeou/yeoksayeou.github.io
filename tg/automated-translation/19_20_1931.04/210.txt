Han River Water, Life, Secret, Eternity
						Cho Chonghyŏn

This water flows and flows, flows over twelve more bends,
It waters this River and Mountain (江山). It pours new Life (生命) into it.
In my garden welcoming spring, may the old flowers bloom again.

Do you hear this water's sound? Only those who can hear will hear it,
Do you see its winding? Only those who can see will see it,
If you quietly understand, let us bravely go forth.

This river water will always flow just like this,
Father after father crossed it, one by one,
We too, singing songs, holding hands, shall cross.
-1931. Early Spring- <88>

**Summary**

The poem uses the image of the eternally flowing Han River to symbolize enduring life, hidden truths accessible only to the discerning, and the connection between past and future generations. The river nourishes the land, representing hope and renewal ("may the old flowers bloom again"). It carries a secret message for those who can perceive it, urging them toward brave action. The final stanza emphasizes continuity, as the current generation follows the path of their ancestors, crossing the river together in unity and song. From a historical perspective, the poem, written during the Japanese colonial period, subtly evokes themes of national endurance, resilience, and hope for a future liberation. The river, a central element of Korean geography and identity, becomes a metaphor for the unwavering spirit of the nation and the necessary journey ("crossing") towards a better future, connecting generations in this shared aspiration. Historians might find the poem's coded language of hope and call to action significant within the context of cultural resistance under colonial rule.

漢江水, 生命 秘密 永遠
						趙宗玄
이 물이 흘러 흘러 열두구비 더도 흘러,
이 江山 추지우네. 새론 生命 부어주네.
봄맞는 이내 동산에 옛꽃 다시 피과저.

듯는가 이 물소래 드를이만 드를 것이,
보는가 구비침도 보실이만 보올것이,
가만이 아시그들랑 용감히만 나가세.

이 강물 언제라도 이대로만 흐르것다,
아버지 한 아버지 차레차레 건느시고,
우리도 노래부르며 손맞잡고 건느리.
