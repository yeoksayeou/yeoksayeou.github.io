Author: 任鳳淳
Article Type: 논설 (Editorial)

The Chŏngp'yŏng Farmers' Union (定平農民組合) in South Hamgyŏng Province (咸南), embracing over 5,000 members, has for several years experienced continuous incidents, including clashes with the landlord class and police forces. Concurrently, over 120 union members have been arrested by the police; some are already serving sentences, and others have been referred to preliminary trials (豫審). Among them, dozens of people have been detained by the police for two to three months undergoing investigation, up until January 25th of this year.

On January 25, 1931, at 11 PM, the Chŏngp'yŏng Police (定平警察), having coordinated with the South Hamgyŏng Police Department High-Level Section (咸南警察部高等課), fully mobilized even the police officers from the nine police substations (駐在所) within its jurisdiction and conducted a mass arrest (總檢擧) of 145 cadre-level members of the Chŏngp'yŏng Farmers' Union.

**Summary**

This editorial discusses the severe crackdown on the Chŏngp'yŏng Farmers' Union in South Hamgyŏng Province, which had over 5,000 members and a history of conflict with landlords and police. It highlights the arrest of over 120 members, with many facing detention, preliminary trials, or imprisonment. The article specifically details a large-scale, coordinated police operation on January 25, 1931, resulting in the mass arrest of 145 union leaders. For historians, this piece offers valuable insight into the organized peasant resistance movements in colonial Korea during the 1930s and the forceful suppression methods employed by the Japanese colonial authorities and collaborating local forces. The scale and coordination of the arrests underscore the perceived threat posed by such organized agricultural unions to the colonial regime and the existing social hierarchy.
