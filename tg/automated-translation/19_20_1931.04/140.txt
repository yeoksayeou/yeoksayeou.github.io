						Chŏn Uhan

Having come to the stream bank to forget the world's sorrows,
I stand blankly looking down at the flowing water;
Only the sound of water shimmering in the moonlight exists.
What can I do with this sorrow that has nowhere to rest?

In the empty field, the sound of the night wind gallops like a horse,
And only the sound of water in the remaining rapids sounds newly fresh.
I now know that for human life, only Death and Solitude exist... .<72>

**Summary**

The poem expresses a deep sense of melancholy and existential despair. The speaker seeks solace by a stream but finds the natural sounds only amplify their feeling of sorrow, which has "nowhere to rest." Contemplating the emptiness of the field and the sounds of nature, the speaker concludes that human existence is ultimately defined by death and loneliness. For historians, this poem offers a glimpse into the personal expression of sorrow and perhaps a broader sense of disillusionment or resignation that might have been felt by some intellectuals or individuals during the colonial period in Korea, reflecting personal angst rather than overt political commentary.

近咏
						全佑漢
世上시름 잊으려고 냇가에 와서
흐르는 물 우둑히 나려다 보노라니
달빛에 아롱지는 물소리 뿐인 것을
어이하랴 둘 곳 없는 이내 시름을.

뷘들엔 밤바람소리 말을 달리고
잔여울 물소리만 새롭게도 들릴뿐인 것을
人生에겐 死와 寂寞만이 잇음을 내 이제 알앗거니... .＜72＞
