Pioneer of Hangeul Studies, Mr. Ju Sigyŏng
						Kim Sŏn'gi

Mr. Ju Sigyŏng

A Word Before Starting
Mr. Ju Sigyŏng is an elder who will shine eternally in Korean history. However, his true value has not yet been revealed. A proper biography that ought to exist has not yet emerged. Therefore, I have long intended to clarify his position in the history of Korean linguistics, along with his biography.
However, I could not find the time to realize this intention, and suddenly, the 18th anniversary of his passing has arrived.

Childhood Years
The Master was a descendant of the famously fearsome Chief State Councilor Ju Se-bung (周政丞世鵬). On the 7th day of the 11th month of the Pyŏngja year (1876), in the land of Muryŏng, Chŏnsanbang, Pongsan County, Hwanghae Province, he cried out his first powerful sound. His father was Myŏn-sŏk (冕錫), and his mother was Lady Yi (李氏夫人). Born the second of four brothers, he was later adopted out (出繼) to his paternal uncle (仲父), Myŏn-jin (冕鎭).
After his birth, milk was scarce, and that year and the following Chŏngch'uk year were terribly lean years. Even the thin gruel (암죽) the young Master ate was not available for every meal, and three times he lost consciousness (氣盡) before barely reviving. This shows that Heaven sends trials even from the very beginning when bringing forth a great person.
At the age of six, he began studying classical Chinese at home, continuing until twelve. At thirteen, he was brought to live (率養) at his adoptive father's house in Seoul. Again, at thirteen, he went to a teacher and studied classical Chinese until seventeen. It seems the Master did not only study classical Chinese around the age of seventeen; in his book *Kugŏ Munpŏp Ŭmhag* (國語文典音學, Grammar and Phonology of the National Language) (page 34), it is seen that he understood the English alphabet at seventeen.
It was spring when he turned eight. The Master was playing outside the gate with neighborhood children when he suddenly saw the Tŏllŏng Peak (덜렁峰) to the south touching the sky. The thought of touching the sky occurred to him, and he set off with the neighborhood children to climb the mountain (뫼). While the other children got absorbed in picking wildflowers halfway up the mountain, completely forgetting the idea of touching the sky, the Master alone braved the difficult climb and finally reached the summit.
Upon reaching the top, he found the sky was still endlessly far away. Looking down, the houses were far below. Only then did he realize that the sky is truly boundless and limitless, and that appearing high <50> or low is merely an illusion of the eyes. He then joyfully ran back down.
From this, we can infer that the spirit of inquiry (究理心) burned within the Master even from a young age.

Youthful Years
At the age of eighteen, one year before the Kabo Reforms (甲午更張), he had a great awakening regarding the times. He studied mathematics, domestic and foreign geography, history, and other so-called new learning (新學問) from Paejae Haktang (培材學堂) teachers Pak Se-yang (朴世陽), Chŏng In-dŏk (鄭寅德), and several others. From this time, a strange new world began to appear in the Master's mind, like mountains and rivers becoming visible as the fog lifts.
The following year was the Kabo year (甲午年). After spending some time back in the countryside, the Sino-Japanese War broke out in the 5th month. Seeing the rapidly changing situation, he thoroughly realized that it was not a time for youth to retreat and shrink back, but a time to advance, understand the new era, and cultivate new knowledge. He resolutely came up to Seoul and entered Paejae Haktang (培材學堂).
While studying at the Haktang, he was as heavy as a mountain and spoke little, yet his sharpness was revealed. His unusually deep concern for the times and his keen spirit (氣槪) to move forward set him apart from the crowd, and he earned great respect (推重) among his peers.
However, even during this period of study, his life was by no means smooth. Sometimes he worked as a hired hand (雇傭사리), sometimes as a printing worker (인쇄직공), and struggling with tuition fees, he endured unimaginable hardships (難苦). Yet, he gladly accepted all tribulations (千辛萬苦), strengthened his resolve (砥勵), and pursued his studies. There was no one who did not admire (嘆賞) him.
The Master set his mind on studying Hangeul around the age of seventeen. At that time, while learning classical Chinese from Yi Hoe-jong (李會鍾), a Chinsa (進士), he saw that explaining the meaning of the text was always done in our language. He reasoned internally that writing is simply recording speech, and if the method of recording, the symbols (符號), were as difficult as Chinese characters, acquiring knowledge would be exceedingly difficult. But if done with our script, it would be much more efficient (事半功倍). Considering that the Master had learned English, when he realized our script was alphabetic like English, he must have seen a strange light in his mind. I suspect this light ultimately led the Master to possess the great spirit for Korean language research.
From this time, the Master began researching our script and language. The more he researched, the more he realized the wondrousness (靈妙) of our script and the beauty of our language. Like someone who discovered jewels, he forgot everything else day and night, dedicating himself to cutting, polishing, grinding, and shining this treasure.
His life (生涯) was certainly not simple. He learned seamanship (航海業), studied surveying (測量術), worked as a factory hand (공장직공), became an errand boy in a shop (商廛), worked as a newspaper reporter (신문記者), became an educator (교육가), and even participated in political movements for a time. Despite the many twists and turns (曲折波浪) in his life, his sincerity (誠心) and effort in researching the Korean language never ceased for a moment. Before the Master's Korean language research, nothing else mattered. Neither poverty (困窮) nor impossibility existed.
The Master found his greatest pleasure in dedicating his entire life (全생명) to Korean language research. Therefore, since his awakening, he truly forgot sleep and food (癈寢忘食), spending twenty years as if they were a single day.
Let me briefly list his activities for the research and dissemination of the Korean language.
While studying at Paejae Haktang (培材學堂), he organized the Hyŏpsŏnghoe (協成會) with fellow students. While working at the *Tongnip Sinmun* (독립신문사), he managed the Kukmun Tongshikhoe (國文同式會) with colleagues. When the Ch'ŏngnyŏn Hagwŏn (청년학원) was established in Sangdong (尙洞), he had a National Language Grammar course specially created. Having acquaintances at the Medical School (醫學校) at the time, he established a National Language Research Institute (국어연구소) within it. He founded night schools (夜學) and Sunday lecture centers (日曜강습소). When the National Script Research Institute (국문연구소) was established within the Ministry of Education (學部), he became its central figure. When a Korean Language Research Society (韓語연구회) was established among foreigners, he became the standard for debates (辯難). He pushed for Korean language courses to be taught in public and private schools and took it upon himself to nurture the roots of this movement. When the Chosŏn Kwangmunhoe (朝鮮光文會) was established, he dedicated himself to correcting documents related to the Korean language and script (朝鮮言文) and guiding dictionary compilation (辭典編纂). To make the research of half his life <51> a foundational movement, he founded the Chosŏnŏ Kangseupwŏn (朝鮮語講習院), gathered talented individuals (英俊), and devoted himself to teaching.
Thus, fighting tooth and nail (血眼奮鬪) alone for twenty years for the research and dissemination of the Korean language, he eventually fell ill from this effort and offered his pioneering life on July 27th of the Kabin year (1914). The profound sorrow (悲痛) of society at that time can be well understood by looking at the *Maeil Sinbo* (每日申報) of that day. *Maeil Sinbo* No. 2644, Friday, July 29th:
"Misfortune in the Korean Linguistics World: The sudden passing of Mr. Ju Sigyŏng, the paramount figure (覇王) in the Korean research field, on the 27th was briefly reported yesterday. Upon receiving this news, I visited his main residence (本邸) in Naesusadong, West Kyŏngsŏng (京城西部內需司). The atmosphere (風色) of the household was extremely bleak. Four or five students (書生) were busy preparing for the funeral in the main hall (大廳). The widow (未亡人) and orphaned children (遺孤子女) were all suppressing their mournful tears (哀淚) while sewing the burial clothes (送終衣). One could guess the daily impoverished life of the scholar. I conveyed condolences to the widow through a student. The wife (夫人), her face full of tear marks (淚痕), said, 'My husband's sudden passing is entirely the result of his daily exertions in the educational field. His burden was truly heavy, but he disregarded his personal hardship (苦勞) and never rested for a moment. For several years, his body had become noticeably weaker, and finally, he succumbed to a serious illness, and medicine (藥石) proved ineffective (其效를 奏치 못한 것이야요),' she choked up (鳴咽) and could not form words. 'Moreover, he always left home around 7 AM, taught rotatingly at various schools, and barely returned home around 6 or 7 PM, only to immediately immerse himself in Korean language and other research without a moment's rest. There are five children; the eldest daughter is 16 this year and graduated from Sukmyŏng Girls' School (淑明여학교). The other four siblings are still quite young (幼沖), and especially the 3-year-old infant (襁褓) is pitiable (惻隱). On a meager income, the family barely managed (僅僅히 경과하노라). There are no savings (幾何의 저축도 無하와), and we are helpless (속수무책) regarding the funeral expenses (初終凡節) with our family resources. However, thanks to the loving care (愛顧) of the educational community and my husband's acquaintances (親知諸氏), we will manage a modest funeral (薄敎). Our gratitude is truly difficult to express in words (形言키 難하오이다).' How could Mr. Ju, lying quietly in the next room (越房), depart for the distant road to the Yellow Springs (黃泉) without fully accomplishing his life's great work (一生大業) and without thought for his family's sad fate (悲運)? It makes the observer unable to suppress tears of sympathy (一掬의 同情淚를 難禁이러라).
Furthermore, I visited Mr. Pak Chung-hwa (朴重華), head of Hwimun Ŭisuk (徽文義熟長), who had a close relationship (契分이 敦厚하던) with Mr. Ju. Mr. Pak solemnly straightened his collar (襟을 正하고), tears welling in his eyes (兩眼에 淚를 凝하며), and said, 'My acquaintance with Mr. Ju spans about 10 years now. Our thoughts aligned considerably in public and private matters, and we had promised to join hands (携手同進) in our endeavors. Now, to suddenly bid him eternal farewell (永別) to the netherworld (九泉) fills me with a sorrow (痛惜의 情) truly hard to express (形言키 難하오). His nature (天性) was gentle and peaceful, yet the power of his research thought was strong. Especially, he dedicated himself (其一身을...獻하야) to Korean language research several decades ago, and until today, for a long time, he never changed his determination (基志) for even a moment, consistent from beginning to end (始終이 一日과 如하야). He brought great light (廣히 其光이 有케 하얏고) to the disordered and ruleless (無修理 無규칙한) Korean language. Also, he was good at living contentedly in poverty (安貧을 善히 하아). Though his large family managed on a small income, he never showed the slightest sign of hardship (小毫도 困窮한 색을 現치 아니하며). When others faced hardship and suffering (患難疾苦), he took the lead in helping (率先救助하며). In dealing with people (人接物), he was like a mass of spring breeze (混然히 一團春風이라). To give a concrete example (實例), the number of his students currently in various academic fields reaches several thousand, but all look up to him like a father or older brother (父兄과 如히 仰慕하야), and there is not a single person who does not respect and love him (親敬치 아니하는 者가 無함). From this, one can know his character. In short, his mind (두뇌) was broad and open (恢恢然하야), without any obstruction (一物의 碍滯가 無하고). But his lifelong thought and hope lay entirely in pioneering the future (前途를 개척하며) of the general youth and reversing the declining fortunes (衰運을 만회함) of the Korean language. He was able to forget food and sleep for this (此에 忘會廢寢하야), working diligently without stopping (孜孜不己하얏으며). His way of dealing with the world (處世의 방법) was to hold firmly to the middle path (中道에 善執하야): he liked the new but did not lean towards lightness (輕에 偏치 아니하며); he preserved the old but was not stubborn (固치 아니하고). He toured numerous schools to teach, and his number of teaching hours per week (1주간 敎授시간 數) exceeded that of a student's timetable, yet he never missed a single day (曾히 一日의 결석이 無하며). He never used vehicles (車馬를 不用하고) for commuting, braving wind, snow, rain, and dampness (風雪雨濕을 冒하며), carrying a huge bundle of books (거대한 冊褓를 狹하고) and traveling on foot (徒步來往). He even earned the nickname 'Ju Pottŭngi' (周보퉁이, Ju Bundle). Now, Heaven (皇天) did not help the benevolent (仁을 不助하야), and he has suddenly left this world (奄然히 此世를 去하니) in the prime of his life at 39. I feel as if I have lost one of my arms (余의 一臂를 失한 듯 하오). Regarding the aid for his pitiful surviving family (其 가련한 遺族의 救助), we are currently discussing it, <52> but considering his usual life (彼의 평일을 恐하면), it seems likely that a good support plan will be established.'
I also visited Mr. Ch'oe Nam-sŏn (崔南善), a friend of Mr. Ju who had maintained a close relationship (交誼가 頗密하던) with him over the years. Mr. Ch'oe was also impassioned and sorrowful (慷慨悽悽하야):
'The Master's passing today is a great loss both publicly and privately (公私間 其失이 多大하오). Not just a loss, but truly a major blow (大타격을 被하얏다 하겟소). Just as the results of the Master's decades of painstaking effort (數十年 苦心참담한 결과) were about to be revealed (顯露될 好機를 際하야), he met such a tragic end (悲境에 陷하니). One can only lament the unpredictability of life (인생의 數奇를 恨할 뿐이오). The Master's legacy (遺跡) includes the two books, *Chosŏnŏ Munpŏp* (朝鮮語 文典, Korean Grammar) and *Marŭi Sori* (말의 소리, The Sound of Speech), which are the crystallization (結晶) of his over 20 years of research. His surviving work (遺業) is the Korean Language Research Institute (朝鮮語 연구소). Regardless of how busy he was, he devoted himself earnestly (열심從事하야) and produced graduates. Now, if we succeed his legacy (先生님의 遺業을 繼하야) and maintain this institute, perhaps the Master's work will not be lost (實手치 아니하겟고). Since last year, the Master and like-minded people (有志) were preparing to undertake a major writing project (大著作에 착수하기를 준비하다가), but suddenly we lost the central figure (中心人物을 失하얏은 즉). It is difficult to predict (預言키 難하고) what will happen in the future. Regarding the support for his surviving family (其 遺族救護), this is our responsibility (責任이오) and duty (의무라). If we do not teach this (此를 敎치 아니하면), who in this world would dedicate themselves (一身을 獻하야) to public service (公公에 從事할 者가 有하오리까)?'
(Postscript) Originally intended only as a brief biography.
I intended to cover: 1. The Master's position in the history of Korean linguistics. 1. The Master's personality and achievements. 1. A critique of the Master's writings, etc., but due to space and time constraints, I lay down my pen (붓을 던지니) here with only the brief biography. I ask for the readers' understanding.

**Summary**

This 1932 article by Kim Sŏn'gi eulogizes Ju Sigyŏng, a pioneering scholar of the Korean language (Hangeul), 18 years after his death in 1914. It recounts his modest origins, early intellectual curiosity, embrace of "new learning," and his pivotal decision around age 17 to dedicate his life to studying and promoting the Korean script and language, recognizing its potential efficiency compared to classical Chinese. Despite enduring significant poverty and hardship, working various jobs, Ju relentlessly pursued his linguistic research, established numerous organizations (like the Kukmun Tongshikhoe, Chosŏnŏ Kangseupwŏn), taught widely, and became a central figure in standardizing and advocating for Korean language education. The article includes moving contemporary accounts from the *Maeil Sinbo* newspaper detailing the grief at his premature death at 39, highlighting his dedication, poverty, gentle character, and the immense respect he commanded, along with testimonies from colleagues Pak Chung-hwa and Ch'oe Nam-sŏn lamenting the loss and vowing to continue his work and support his family.

From a historical perspective, the article is significant as it reflects the burgeoning linguistic nationalism and cultural consciousness among Korean intellectuals during the Japanese colonial period. Ju Sigyŏng's efforts to systematize and promote Hangeul were implicitly acts of cultural resistance against assimilation policies. The emphasis on his poverty, hard work ("Ju Pottŭngi"), and dedication paints him as a national hero sacrificing for the Korean language, a potent symbol for a colonized people. The inclusion of prominent figures like Ch'oe Nam-sŏn and Pak Chung-hwa underscores the intellectual network dedicated to preserving Korean identity through language study. Historians might find the contemporary newspaper excerpts and personal testimonies particularly valuable for understanding the social impact of Ju's work and the atmosphere among Korean intellectuals grappling with cultural preservation under colonial rule.

周時經 先生
먼저할 말
周時經 선생은 朝鮮史上에서 영원히 빛나실 어른이시다. 그러나 그의 참된 가치는 아직도 밝혀지지 아니하엿다. 맛당히 잇어야할 그의 傳記도 볼만한 것이 나지 아니하엿다. 그러므로 나는 평소에 선생의 傳記와 아울러 그의 朝鮮어학사상의 지위를 밝혀 보려고 하엿다.
그러나 겨를을 얻지 못하야 뜻을 펴지못하엿는데 어느덧 선생이 잇음을 여이신지 18朞年을 맞게 되엇다.

어린이 시절
선생은 무섭기로 이름이 높은 周政丞世鵬의 後裔이니 丙子(1876) 11월 7일에 黃海道 鳳山郡 錢山坊茂陵땅에서 으아 하고 힘찬 첫소리를 외첫다. 父親은 冕錫이요 어머니는 李氏夫人이니 형제4人의 둘재로 태어나 뒤에 仲父 冕鎭에게로 出繼하니라.
난 뒤에 젖이 흔하지 못하더니 그 해와 이듬해 丁丑年은 무서운 흉년이라 어린 선생의 먹던 암죽도 끼니를 잇지 못하야 세 번이나 氣盡하엿다가 겨우 다시 깨어난 일이 잇으니 하눌이 偉人을 내시며 그 生初부터 이러틋 시련이 잇음을 알레라.
여섯 살에 집에서 한문을 읽기 시작하야 열두살까지 읽다가 열세살에 서울에 잇든 養父宅으로 率養되어 다시 열세살에 스승께 나아가 漢學을 열일곱까지 읽으니라. 선생이 열일곱적에는 漢學만 공부한 것 같지 아니하니 그의 著書 國語文典音學에(34頁)보면 열일곱에 英文의 子母를 깨달엇다함을 보아 알겟더라.
여듧살 되든 해 봄일이라 선생이 이웃집 아이들로 더부러 문밖에서 놀다가 문득 남쪽에 잇는 덜렁峰이 하눌에 맞닿은 것을 보고 하눌을 만저 볼 생각이 나아 이웃집 아이들과 作伴하야 뫼에 오를새, 다른 아이들은 뫼중턱에서 풀꽃따기에 맛들여 하눌 만질 생각을 아주 잊되 선생은 홀로 오르기 험한 것을 무릅쓰고 기어이 산꼭다기에 올라 가니라.
올라가 보니 거기서도 하눌은 까마득이 멀뿐더러 아래를 굽어보니 집들이 저 아래에 잇는지라 이때에 비로소 하눌은 참으로 끝이 없고 한이 없으며 높게도 보이고＜50＞ 낮게도 보임은 오즉 눈의 착각임을 깨닷고 그제야 기뻐 뛰어 나려오더라.
선생은 이러틋 어렷을적부터 究理心이 속에 불타올랏음을 미루어 알지니라.

젊은이 시절
열여듧 살 곳 甲午更張전 一年에 時運에 크게 깨달음이 잇어 그때 培材學堂 교사 朴世陽
鄭寅德 그 밖에 멫분에게 數理며 內外地理 역사 등 이른 바 新學問을 배울새 이때부터 선생의 마음속에는 이상한 세계가 안개가 걷히며 山川이 보이듯이 보이기 시작하니라.
이듬해 甲午年이라 얼마동안 시골에 도라가 잇더니 5월에 日淸전쟁이 이러나 時勢가 급전함을 보고 청년은 결코 退嬰萎縮해서는 아니될 때요 나아가 新시대를 이해하고 새지식을 닦어야 할 것을 철저히 깨닷고 奮然히 서울에 올라와 培材學堂에 입학하니라.
學堂에 입학修學할새 산같이 무거워 말이 없으나 오히려 그 부리의 드러남이 잇고 時勢에 대한 남다른 깊은 걱정과 앞으로 나가려는 날카로운 氣槪가 무리에 벗어나는지라 또래가 운대 크게 推重을 입더라.
그러나 이러케 공부하는 동안도 결코 생활이 평탄치 아니하엿나니 혹 雇傭사리도 하고 혹 인쇄직공노릇도 하며 學資에 몰려 이루 상상할 수 없는 難苦를 겪으면서도 欣然히 千辛萬苦를 받으며 뜻을 砥勵하며 학업에 나아가니 嘆賞치 아니하는 이 없더라.
선생이 한글 연구에 뜻두기는 열일곱살적이라. 그때에 李進士會鍾氏에게 漢學을 배울새 매양 그 글뜻을 푸리할 제마다 반드시 우리말로 함을 보고 心中에 스스로 헤아리기를 글이란 것은 말을 적으면 그만이라 그런데 그 적는 방법이 곳 符號가 한문처럼 어려워서야 학식을 얻기에 여간 어렵지 아니할것이나 만일 우리 글로씨 한다면 事半功倍하리라고 깨닷게 되니라. 생각건대 선생은 英文을 배웟으니까 우리의 글이 英文과 같이 알파베트式 글자인 것을 깨다를 제 마음속에 이상한 불빛을 보앗으리라. 이 불빛이 마침내 선생으로 하여금 朝鮮語 연구의 大精神을 갖게 하심을 짐작하겟도다.
선생이 이때부터 우리 글과 말을 연구하기 시작하니 연구하면 연구할수록 우리 글의 靈妙한 것과 우리말의 아름다움으로 깨닷게 되니만치 보석을 발견한 사람처럼 밤낮 이 보배를 깍고 다듬고 갈고 빛내기에 온갓 것을 다 잊은 것이니라.
그의 生涯는 결코 단순하지 아니 하얏으니 혹은 航海業도 배우고 測量術도 연구하고 혹 공장직공노릇을 하고 혹 商廛의 심부름꾼도 되고 혹 신문記者가 되고 혹 교육가가 되며 한때는 정치운동에도 참가하야 생활에 曲折波浪이 많엇으되 朝鮮語연구의 誠心과 노력은 한때도 끊임이 없엇으나 선생의 朝鮮語연구 앞에는 아모 것도 없엇나니라. 困窮도 없엇고 불가능도 없엇나니라.
선생은 朝鮮語연구를 위하야 全생명을 바침을 가장 큰 쾌락으로 삼음으로써이니라. 그러므로 한번 自覺한 이래 實로 癈寢忘食하야 20년을 하로같이 보내엇나니라.
대강 朝鮮語의 연구와 보급을 위하야 활동한 역사를 적어보리라.
培材學堂 在學時에는 同門生으로 더부러 協成會를 조직하엿으며 독립신문사 在職中에는 동업자와 한가지 國文同式會를 경영하얏으며 尙洞에 청년학원이 설립되며 國語文法科를 特設하게 하여 당시 醫學校에 親知가 잇으며 그 안에 국어연구소를 두며 밤에는 夜學 日曜에는 日曜강습소를 설립하며 學部中에 국문연구소가 되며 그 연구에 中樞가 되며 外人사이에 韓語연구회가 설립되매 그 辯難의 표준이 되며 公私立학교에 국어과정을 敎授케하고 自擔하야 근원을 培養하는 운동을 열매 朝鮮光文會가 설립되며 朝鮮言文에 관한 文書校正과 辭典編纂의 指導에 힘쓴 것이며 自家半生의 연구의＜51＞ 根底잇는 운동을 삼으려고 朝鮮語講習院을 창립하야 英俊을 모아 敎導에 뜻을 다한 것들이니라.
이같이 朝鮮語연구와 보급을 위하야 單身을 血眼奮鬪 20년에 급기야 이로 因하야 病이 나서 甲寅(1914) 7월 27일에 先驅者的 一生을 바치니 당시 일반사회의 悲痛은 그때 每日申報을 보아 넉넉히 알레라 每日申報 2644號 7월 29일 金曜
『朝鮮語學界의 불행 朝鮮연구계에 覇王되는 周時經氏가 작년27일에 돌연 長逝함은 昨報에 畧記하얏거니와 此報를 接하고 京城西部內需司에 在한 氏의 本邸를 訪한 즉 一家의 風色은 참담을 극하야 4, 5人의 書生은 大廳에서 葬禮준비에 忙殺하고 未亡人及遺孤子女는 皆哀淚를 억제하며 送終衣를 裁縫하니 可히
平日窮貧한 學者생활을 추측하겟더라. 書生을 의뢰하야 미망인에게 吊意를 통하니 夫人은 淚痕이 滿面하야 家夫의 돌연 長逝는 전혀 平日 교육계 奔走하야 其 부담이 殆重하나 一身의 苦勞는 不顧하고 잠시도 休養치 아니한 결과 數年來로는 자체가 顯著히 허약하더니 心竟 重病에 陷하야 藥石이 其效를 奏치 못한 것이야요 하며
鳴咽하야 能히 語를 成치 못하며 一尤 항상 上午7시경에 家를 出하야 各학교로 轉轉敎授하다가 오후 6, 7時에 겨우 歸宅하야는 更히
朝鮮語及其他 연구로 잠‹œ도 휴식치 못하얏지오. 자녀는 5남매가 有하야 長女는 今年16歲로 淑明여학교를 졸업하얏고 其外 4남매는 姑히 幼沖를 未免인 중 더욱 3歲의 襁褓가 惻隱해요 평일에 略少한 수입으로 一家가 僅僅히 경과하노라 幾何의 저축도 無하와 初終凡節에 家力으로는 속수무책이나 禮 교육계及 家君의 親知諸氏의 愛顧로 薄敎라도 俱하겟사오니 감사함은 實로 形言키 難하오이다.」 越房에 靜臥한 周氏는 어찌
自己의 一生大業을 완전히 성취하지 못하고 如斯히 가족의 悲運도 念치 아니하고 黃泉의 遠路를 作하얏는지 觀者로 하쓀¼금 一掬의 同情淚를 難禁이러라.
更히 氏와 平昔에 契分이 敦厚하던 徽文義熟長 朴重華氏를 訪하니 氏는 槪然히 襟을 正하고 兩眼에 淚를 凝하며 余의 周君을 知함은 于今 約10 년간이라 公私間에 頗히 意思가 相合하야 吾輩사업에 携手同進하기를 約하얏더니 今에 돌연히
彼를 九泉으로 永別하니 痛惜의 情은 實로 形言키 難하오 彼의 天性은 온후 화평하며 연구思想의 力이 강하며, 특히 彼는 數10년 전부터 其一身을 朝鮮語연구에 獻하야 今日에 至하기까지 長久한 間에 잠시도 基志를 변치 아니하고 始終이 一日과 如하야 無修理 無규칙한 朝鮮語로 하야곰 廣히 其光이 有케 하얏고 又彼는 安貧을 善히 하아 사소한 수입으로 多率이 경과하나 小毫도 困窮한 색을 現치 아니하며 人의 患難疾苦에는 率先救助하며 기대 人接物에는 混然히 一團春風이라 其 實例로 言하면 今日 各 學界에 在한
彼의 제자가 數千人에 達하나 擧皆 彼를 父兄과 如히 仰慕하야 一人이라도 彼를 親敬치 아니하는 者가 無함으로 可히 知할지니 요컨대 彼의 두뇌는 恢恢然하야 一物의 碍滯가 無하고 但 평생의 思想과 희망은 전혀 일반 청년의 前途를 개척하며 朝鮮語의 衰運을 만회함에 在하야 能히 此에 忘會廢寢하야 孜孜不己하얏으며 其 處世의 방법은 中道에 善執하야 新을 好하나 輕에 偏치 아니하며 古를 守하나 固치 아니하고 數多의 학교를 巡廻敎授하야
1주간 敎授시간 數는 학생수업시간표보다 猶多하나 曾히 一日의 결석이 無하며 往來에는 결코 車馬를 不用하고 風雪雨濕을 冒하며 거대한 冊褓를 狹하고 徒步來往함으로 「周보퉁이」라는 별명까지 有하얏던 터이라 今에 皇天이 仁을 不助하야 39歲의 壯年으로 奄然히 此世를 去하니 余는 殆히 余의 一臂를 失한 듯 하오 其 가련한 遺族의 救助에 대하야도 방금 연구중이나＜52＞ 彼의 평일을 恐하면 아마 양호한 救助방침이 성립될 듯 하오.
또 氏의 友로 年來氏와 交誼가 頗密하던 崔南善氏를 訪한 즉 氏亦 慷慨悽悽하야
今日 선생의 逝去난 公私間 其失이 多大하오. 失이 有할 뿐 아니라 實로 大타격을 被하얏다 하겟소. 선생의 數十年 苦心참담한 결과가 이에서 비로소 顯露될 好機를 際하야 如斯히 悲境에 陷하니 인생의 數奇를 恨할 뿐이오. 선생의 遺跡으로는 「朝鮮語 文典」과 「말의 소리」의 兩書가 즉 선생의 20餘年 연구의 結晶이오.
其 遺業으로는 朝鮮語 연구소가 是라. 如何히 多忙함을 不顧하고 열심從事하야 기회의 졸업생이 有하얏은 즉 今에 선생님의 遺業을 繼하야 此를 유지하면 庶히 선생의 遺業이 실수치 아니하겟고 작년來로 선생과 有志가 합하야 大著作에 착수하기를 준비하다가 遠然히 중심인물을 失하얏은 즉 장래 如何히 될 것은 預言키 難하고 其 遺族救護에 대하야는 是吾輩의 책임이오 또는 의무라 吾輩가 此를 敎치 아니하면 此世에 誰가 一身을 獻하야 公公에 從事할 者가 有하오리까.」
