**Summary**

This article outlines the submission guidelines for a feature titled "Student Life March" in the *Tonggwang* magazine. It invites students from middle schools and above across Korea to answer a series of questions about their school's pride, specialties, friendships, rivalries, cheers, and their perceptions of students at other schools (specifically asking boys about girls' schools and vice versa). Submissions are due by July 15th, and selected contributors whose names and addresses are provided will receive a free copy of the magazine issue featuring their responses. The questions provide insight into student culture, inter-school relations, and gender perceptions in colonial Korea during the early 1930s. Historians might find the structured questions about school rivalries, friendships, and especially the explicit request for gendered evaluations of other schools' student bodies revealing about social dynamics and the cultivation of school identities during that period.
