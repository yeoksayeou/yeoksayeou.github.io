Short Verses on Fleeting Thoughts
						Yi T’ak (李鐸)

Early Spring

The old branches whisper, I listen to the sound of their breath.
The frozen stream wriggles and twists, visible to the eye.
Even the rock embedded on the hilltop seems about to stir.

After Rain

One night's fallen drizzle passes the hand's sorrow.
The mountains are vibrant with colors, the stream banks are vividly green.
As if dazed, I close my eyes, and see the mountains and streams of home.

Lamp Oil

The occasional sputtering sound, is it a lament, sad from drowsiness?
The smell! What good is staying long with that smell?
Better to become bright light and disappear.

Winding the Clock's Spring

The force suppressed in this spring turns the whole mechanism.
O suppressed masses, do not lose your strong power!
The movement of the Universe lies solely in this. <93>

**Summary**

These four short poems by Yi T’ak capture fleeting impressions of nature and everyday objects, imbued with deeper reflections. "Early Spring" senses the latent energy in nature awakening from winter. "After Rain" evokes nostalgia for one's hometown landscape after a cleansing rain. "Lamp Oil" contemplates self-sacrifice and transience, preferring a bright, short existence over a lingering, unpleasant one. "Winding the Clock's Spring" uses the metaphor of a coiled spring releasing energy to encourage resilience and recognize the power inherent in suppressed forces, urging perseverance. From a historical perspective, the final poem, with its direct address to the "suppressed masses" (눌린 무리들아) and its message about retaining "strong power" (강력), is particularly striking. It can be interpreted as a veiled call for resilience and eventual uprising against the oppressive conditions of Japanese colonial rule in Korea during the 1930s, using the mechanical energy of a clock spring as a metaphor for potential social and political change.

隨感短吟
						李鐸
早春
묵은 가지 소근소근 숨껼소리 귀울리네
언 개울 움실움실 뒤트는 양 눈에 보이네
언덕위 박인 바위도 움즉일 듯 하고녀

雨後
하룻밤 나란 실비 손의 시름 지내노나
山은 욹웃붉웃 시내 언덕 푸릇푸릇
어린 듯 눈감으니 고향산천 보이네

燈油
잇다금 빠짓소리 졸기 설어 하소연가
냄새! 그 냄새로 오래잇언 무얼하리
차라리 밝은 빛으로 化해 없어지렴은

시계의 태엽을 감으면서
이탕개 눌린 힘이 온 기계를 돌리나다
눌린 무리들아 강력만 잃지마라
宇宙의 움즉여 감이 오즉 이에 잇느니.＜93＞
