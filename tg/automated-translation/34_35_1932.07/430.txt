Wandering
						O Rak-kyo

It's not that I yearn for anyone,
Nor that I have reason to cry tonight,
But I stand alone, wandering on the dark street.

The bell cricket in my bosom
Sings its chirping song,
And the firefly has lit its lamp and gone to find a friend,
But this body with nowhere to go
Walks steadily down the quiet street.

The night steadily deepens—. <97>

**Summary**

The poem "Wandering" by O Rak-kyo depicts a solitary individual roaming a dark, quiet street at night. The speaker feels aimless and disconnected, explicitly stating they neither long for anyone nor have cause for tears. This contrasts with the natural world around them – a cricket sings in their pocket, and a firefly seeks companionship – highlighting the speaker's profound sense of isolation and lack of direction as the night deepens. For historians, this poem offers a glimpse into the personal sentiments of alienation and purposelessness that could reflect broader feelings of displacement or societal unease experienced by individuals during the Korean colonial period. Such themes were common in the literature of the era, potentially serving as subtle commentary on the constraints and uncertainties of life under colonial rule.

彷徨
						吳樂敎
누구를 그림도 아니요
그러타고 이 밤에 울리도 없건마는
어두운 거리에 홀로서서 헤매이네
품속에 여치는
짤각짤각 노래를 부르고
반디는 불을 밝히고 동무 찾아 갓는데
갈곳없는 이몸은 조용한 거리를
저벅저벅 걸어가네
밤은 작고 깊어 가는데―.＜97＞
