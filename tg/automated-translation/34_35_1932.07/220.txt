Apology Notice

The results from the Student Literary Circle (학생文壇) are poor. Please strive harder and submit works of great effort (力作). The following articles could not be published due to our unavoidable circumstances.

Short Story: Death of a Cat... Waseda Middle School Extramural Student... Pak Rohong
Poem: Wounded Wings... Ch'angsin School... Kim Sŏngdo
Poem: Waves of the Yalu River (鴨綠江)... P'yŏngyang Sungjung... Kim Ch'angsik
Poem: Father, Please Come Out Quickly... Fushun Middle School... Hwang Sŏngsu<63>

**Summary**

This is an editorial notice from the magazine *Tonggwang* apologizing for not being able to publish several submissions from students. The editors state that the overall quality of submissions to the "Student Literary Circle" section has been poor and urge students to submit better work. They list four specific pieces (one short story, three poems) by named students from various schools (including one in Fushun, Manchuria, and an extramural student from Waseda Middle School) that were not published due to "unavoidable circumstances." For historians, this brief notice highlights the existence and encouragement of student literary activities in colonial Korea, reveals the geographical reach of the magazine's contributors (including Manchuria and potentially students associated with Japanese institutions), and hints at potential editorial constraints or censorship, common during the period, masked by the phrase "unavoidable circumstances."
