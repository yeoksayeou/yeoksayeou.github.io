Being Good Is Also a Sickness
						Song Sun-il

Being good is also a sickness.
Justice—that boiled up, heart-wrenching and choking,
Justice that shone like a rainbow,
When it turns into the bloody smell of spear tips and vanishes like smoke,
O you who still search for buried Humanity,
Rummaging through book pages and sharpening your pen!
Open your fist.
Were you even holding a throwing stone?
Like David who defeated Goliath—.

Even shouting on an empty mountain should bring an echo,
Yet though one heart, one will burns like a bellows,
How can the first one to cry out not match strides with others?
One rooster’s crow makes all the village roosters crow, but—
Ah, being good is also a sickness.
If you and I both raised our necks and played the fire flute,
Dawn would come to this sky, this land,
But difficult tasks are pushed onto others, just waiting for that time,
And so the white flags of cowards jostle for position.

Sound, Sound, Clear Sound (Little Song)

Sound, sound, clear sound,
The sound of a stream where ice has melted.
Following the waves, following the sunlight,
The fishes' land of freedom.

Sound, sound, clear sound,
The sound of a willow flute playing.
In the sunny yard,
The children just sing spring songs.

Sound, sound, clear sound,
The skylark is singing high above,
The young lady gathering herbs,
What song might she be singing? <91>

**Summary**

The first poem, "Being Good Is Also a Sickness," expresses profound frustration with passive intellectualism and inaction in the face of disappearing justice. The poet criticizes those who merely study and write instead of taking direct action, invoking the image of David and Goliath. He laments the lack of unity and condemns the cowardice of avoiding responsibility, suggesting that collective action could bring about change ("dawn"). The second poem, "Sound, Sound, Clear Sound," contrasts sharply, painting an idyllic, peaceful scene of spring with melting streams, playing children, and singing birds, perhaps representing a longed-for state of freedom and normalcy absent under oppression. For historians, the poems starkly reflect the anguish and suppressed desire for resistance among Korean intellectuals during the Japanese colonial period. The first poem's call for action, albeit veiled, and its critique of passivity offer insight into the psychological and political climate, while the second poem underscores the yearning for peace and natural beauty amidst hardship.

착한 것도 병이지
						宋順鎰
착한 것도 병이지
가슴이 미여지고 목메이게
긇어오르든 正義- 무지개같이도 빛나든 정의가
창 끝에 피비린내 되어 연기같이 살아질 때
그래도 파묻힌 人道를 찾겟노라
책장을 뒤지고 펜을 갈고 잇는 이어!
그대의 주먹을 페여보라.
팔매돌이라도 쥐엇든가?
『골리아디』를 이기든 『따윗』 같이도-.

뷔인산에 소리처도 산울님 잇으려든
한마음 한뜻이 풀무같이 타는데
첫소리 치는 이와 발거름이 안맞다니
한머리 닭도 왼마을닭 울니는데
아아, 착한 것도 병이지
너도나도 목느리고 불피리를 불양이면
이하늘 이따에 새벽성되렷마는
어려운 일 남께 밀고 그때만 기다리나니
비겁자의 힌기빨이 자리다툼하는고나.

소리소리 맑은소리(小曲)
소리소리 맑은소리
어름풀린 냇물소리
물결따라 햇볓따라
고기들의 자유나라.

소리소리 맑은소리
버들피리 부는소리
양지발ㄹ은 마당에서
아해들은 봄노래만.

소리소리 맑은소리
종달새는 우짖는데
나물캐는 아가씨는
무슨노래 부르려나. ＜91＞
