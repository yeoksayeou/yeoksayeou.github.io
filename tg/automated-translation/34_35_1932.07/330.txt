Do you remember?
						Mo Yun-suk

Drunk on moonlight, the white poplar stood trembling,
And the silver stream that rippled like every day?
The whispering night bird rustled the tree leaves—
That time by the stream, haven't you forgotten?

In the cloudless blue sky, the starlight smiled,
And from the mulberry grove, the insects' breath went *ssaek-ssaek*?
In the fragrant night dew, your cheek, like a peach blossom,
Gently turned red—do you know that cheek?

Your pearl-like eyes, using the stream as a mirror,
Quietly smiled upon the water?
When I plucked flowers from the flower bed and scattered them on the water,
"Oh my, I don't know," you blushed then?

As time goes by, that memory blooms anew,
Causing bitter tears to pool in the collapsed hall.
If you have a sharp blade,
Please shatter this boundless castle wall of memory. <93>

**Summary**

The poem is a nostalgic yet painful recollection of a past romantic encounter by a stream under the moonlight. The speaker vividly recalls sensory details—the trembling poplar, the rippling stream, the starlight, the insects' sounds, the companion's blushing cheek. However, this memory, initially sweet, now brings pain, described metaphorically as bitter tears in a "collapsed hall" and a "boundless castle wall" the speaker wishes to be destroyed. For historians, the poem offers insight into the personal and emotional expressions prevalent in Korean literature during the colonial period. While ostensibly personal and lyrical, the intense desire to shatter painful memories, symbolized by the "collapsed hall" and "castle wall," could potentially be interpreted by some scholars as reflecting, perhaps unconsciously, the broader suffering or loss felt under colonial rule, even if the poem's surface is purely romantic. The use of older Korean orthography is also of linguistic interest.

記憶하느냐고?
						毛允淑
달빛에 醉하여 白楊이 떨고 섯고
배일같이 출렁이든 은빛시내 말이요?
속삭이든 밤새가 나무닢 떨려주든
그 시냇가 그때를 안잊엇느냐고?

구름없는 蒼空에 별빛이 웃음웃고
뽕나무숲에서 버레숨이 쌕쌕하든 때
향기러운 밤이슬에 그대뺨이 복사꽃처럼
사르르 붉어지든 그 뺨을 아느냐고?

眞珠빛 그대눈이 시내를 거울삼아
가만히 물우에 웃음짓든 때
花壇의 꽃을 따서 물흐려놓으니
아이고 몰라요 낱붉이든 그때말이요

갈쓰록 그 기억은 새로 피어나
무너진 殿堂안에 쓴 눈물을 고이게 하나니
너에게 날카로운 칼날이 잇을찐대
이 가없는 추억의 城壁을 깨트려달라.＜93＞
