**Body Text Translation:**
Sorrowful One, Snow Falls in the Spring Season
						Ho Che-gwang

That distant road,
That sky, cannot be returned to,

It's a path to cry and play by the seashore,
It's a mind to wring tears onto the barley sprouts,

Where the camellia trees bloom,
Why did you come?

Did you come through the night?
Did you lose your way and come to the Southern Land (南國)?

Go cry in the shepherd's purse field.
When the shepherd's purse flowers bloom, when the white flowers bloom, your heart too shall bloom.
—3 years ago, in the Southern Province (南道)— <95>

**Summary**

This poem by Ho Che-gwang expresses a deep sense of sorrow, loss, and displacement, symbolized by the unnatural event of snow falling in spring. The speaker laments a path they cannot return to and questions the arrival of someone (perhaps the snow, or the sorrow itself) in a place of blooming camellias, the "Southern Land." Despite the pervasive sadness, the poem ends on a fragile note of hope, suggesting that like the blooming shepherd's purse flowers, the sorrowful heart might eventually find solace. From a historical perspective, the poem's themes of displacement ("cannot be returned to," "lost your way"), sorrow associated with a specific location ("Southern Province"), and the sense of something being unnatural or out of season could reflect the emotional landscape of Koreans under Japanese colonial rule, hinting at loss of home, forced migration, or a general feeling of disruption and sadness. The contrast between the harshness (snow) and the beauty of nature (flowers, Southern Land) adds to the poignant expression of suffering.

서러운이, 봄절에 눈 옴
						胡濟光
그 먼길,
저 하눌, 못 돌아갈껄,

해개바주 울려놀 길인 것을
보리싹에 눈물 짤 맘인 것을,

동백나무 꽃피는데
오긴 왜왓소.

밤을 새워 온다나
길잃어 南國으로 왓다나.

냉이밭에 울다나 가소.
냉이꽃 피면, 힌꽃 피면. 그대 마음도 피오리.
―3년전, 南道에서― ＜95＞
