						Tonggwangsa

We respectfully announce that the following works could not be published due to unavoidable circumstances.

(Poem) A Child Who Lost Their Parents... Song Sun-il
(Poem) To the Citizen in Mourning Clothes... Yi Kyu-wŏn
(Poem) Oh, Warrior of the East... Kim T'ae-o
(Poem) Will You Not Light the Lamp?... Mugŭk

**Summary**

This article is a brief notice from the publisher, Tonggwangsa, stating that seven listed poems could not be included in issue No. 35 of the magazine *Tonggwang* due to "unavoidable circumstances." The unpublished poems are listed by title and author. From a historical perspective, the list of unpublished poem titles is potentially revealing. Titles such as "To the Citizen in Mourning Clothes," "Oh, Warrior of the East," and "One Who Cries Out Towards the Blue Sky" suggest themes of grief, resistance, or social commentary that may have been deemed sensitive or unacceptable by the Japanese colonial authorities in 1932, hinting at censorship practices during that period. Historians might find this notice indicative of the limitations placed on literary expression under colonial rule.
