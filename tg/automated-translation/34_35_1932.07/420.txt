Spring Water
						Cha Illo

In the mountain valley, a stream—
Oh, everywhere spring water flows!
Shattering jewels amidst the rock crevices,
Newly humming a joyful song!
—Freedom's song! Liberation's song! Victory's song!...
—To soar! To leap! To run!...

Into the river, let it overflow—
Oh, everywhere the spring water is full!
Waves clear as a mirror, smooth as oil
Reflecting the clouds, shimmering in the sunlight—
Ah, how vast and overflowing is the spring water of this river! <97>

**Summary**

This poem by Cha Illo celebrates the arrival of spring, symbolized by the energetic flow of water in mountain streams and rivers. The water is depicted as powerful, breaking through rocks, singing songs of freedom, liberation, and victory, and filling the rivers with clear, reflective waves. Historically, this poem from 1932, during the Japanese colonial period, is interesting for its vibrant imagery and explicit mentions of "freedom," "liberation," and "victory." While ostensibly about nature, the energetic tone and these specific words could be interpreted by historians as a subtle yet potent expression of Korean nationalistic feeling and a longing for liberation, using the unstoppable force of spring water as a metaphor for resilience and the desire to break free.

봄물
						車一路
산골에 시내―
오오 곳곳에 봄물이 흐릅니다!
바위틈에 구슬을 부시고
즐거운 노래를 새로 읍조리며!
―자유입조 해방입조 승리입조...
―솟을랏다 뛸랏다 달을랏다...

강에다 늧?에라―
오오 곳곳에 봄물은 가득 하외다!
거울같이 맑고 기름같이 미끄러운 물결
구름을 비치우고 햇빛을 출렁거리고―
아아 洋洋도 할씨고 이강의 봄물이여! ＜97＞
