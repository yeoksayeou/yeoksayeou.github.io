Mother's Soul
						Sogŭmjaengi

The pure white petals of the Snow Chrysanthemum
When the wind blows
In the fragrance it sends,
A new thought—
The scent of milk from a white breast
It's clear, isn't it!
Mother, is that flower
Your soul?

One leaf, two leaves falling
When the wind blows
The autumn tidings they announce,
A new thought—
Back when frost first formed,
You were here!
Mother, are those leaves
Your soul?<66>

**Summary**

This short poem by "Sogŭmjaengi" (Salt Strider) expresses a poignant sense of longing for the speaker's deceased mother. The speaker perceives the mother's presence or soul (魂) in natural elements – the scent of white chrysanthemums evoking the memory of her breast milk, and falling autumn leaves reminding the speaker of her presence during the first frost. The poem uses simple, evocative imagery to convey deep filial affection and grief. From a historical perspective, the poem reflects personal sentiment during the colonial period, focusing on universal themes of loss and memory rather than overt political commentary. The use of older Korean orthography (e.g., 쌔하얀잎, 힌 가슴, 알외는, 가울) is characteristic of the era and linguistically interesting for historians.

어머님의 魂
						소금쟁이
雪菊의 쌔하얀잎
바람이 불면
보내주는 향내에
새롭은 생각
힌 가슴의 젖 냄새
분명하지오!
어머니여 그 꽃은
魂이심니까.

落葉이 한잎 두잎
바람이 불면
알외는 가울 기별
새롭은 생각
엄 돋던 그때에는
게시었던 걸요!
어머니여 그 잎은
魂이심니까.＜66＞
