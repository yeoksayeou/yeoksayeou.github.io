**Summary**

This article provides a brief biographical profile of Ŏm Chu-ik, the principal of Yangjŏng High School in 1927. It lists his birth date (1872), place of birth (Kyŏngsŏng/Seoul), pen name, education/career milestones including military service in the Korean Empire army, an appointment at the Kyujanggak, his founding role and principalship at Yangjŏng school (formerly Yangjŏngŭisuk), and his travels, hobbies, and interests. Notably, it mentions his reception of two significant Japanese decorations in 1905 and 1908. For historians, this profile illustrates the path of a member of the late Korean Empire elite transitioning into the colonial education sector. His early acceptance of high-level Japanese honors juxtaposed with his leadership of a prominent private Korean educational institution offers insight into the complex allegiances and career paths available to Koreans during the colonial period. The mention of specific dates, positions (like Kyujanggak Chihogwan), and decorations provides concrete data points for studying the era's social and political landscape.
