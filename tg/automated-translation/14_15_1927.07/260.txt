**Summary**

This article is a short biographical entry for Ch'oe T'aeyŏng (b. 1900), identified in the title as the Dean of Academic Affairs of Kyŏngsin School, though the text clarifies his current position since 1924 is Dean of Academic Affairs at Posŏng College in Kyŏngsŏng (colonial Seoul). It outlines his birthplace (Chang'un, Hwanghae Province), family details (farmer father, wife Kim Kyŏmnyang), education (Kyŏngsin School, Meiji University Faculty of Law), career path, current address in Kyŏngsŏng, interests (religious books, social issues, diaries), and religion (Christianity).

For historians, this profile provides data on a Korean intellectual and educator during the colonial period. His educational trajectory—from a Korean mission school (Kyŏngsin) to a Japanese university (Meiji) and then to a faculty position at a prominent private Korean college (Posŏng)—illustrates one path for educated Koreans under Japanese rule. His role at Posŏng College and his Christian background are significant details reflecting the social, educational, and religious landscape of 1920s Korea.
