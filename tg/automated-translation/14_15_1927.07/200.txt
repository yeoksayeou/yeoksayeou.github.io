**Summary**

This biographical entry outlines the life and career of Pak Sŭngbin (pen name Hakpŏm), born in 1880 in Ch'ŏrwŏn. Educated in law at Chūō University in Tokyo, he held positions as a government official and prosecutor before becoming a lawyer. In 1925, he was appointed principal of Posŏng College in Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul). He was actively involved in various organizations, including the Kyemyŏng Club, the boards of Posŏng College and Hwimun Ŭisuk, the Kyŏngsŏng Nursery, the Korean Bar Association, and the Kyŏngsŏng Relief Society. Notably, he authored a work on Korean grammar, traveled in China, enjoyed studying the Korean language, discussion, Go, and watching sports. For historians, this profile illuminates the trajectory of a Korean elite educated in Japanese law who navigated the colonial system, eventually heading a prominent Korean educational institution. His involvement in multiple Korean civic and educational organizations, alongside his scholarly interest and publication in Korean linguistics during a period of Japanese assimilation pressure, makes him a figure of interest in understanding Korean intellectual and institutional life under colonial rule.
