**Summary**

This article provides a brief biographical sketch of Kim Tong-hyŏk, the Academic Dean of Paejae Higher Common School in Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul) as of 1927. It details his birthdate (1888), education at Paejae Haktang and Hiroshima Higher Normal School (majoring in Natural History), his long teaching career starting in 1908 at Paejae, his family life, affiliation with the Central YMCA, his publications (a textbook), and personal interests (science, Christianity, sports). For historians, this piece offers insight into the background of an educated Korean elite during the colonial period, highlighting the role of missionary schools like Paejae, the path of studying in Japan for advanced education (specifically in science), and engagement with organizations like the YMCA. The mention of "Kae'guk year" for his birth year is also a notable detail reflecting traditional dating methods alongside Western ones.
