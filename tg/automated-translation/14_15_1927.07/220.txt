**Body Text Translation:**
How many children do you want to have?

At Dartmouth University in England [sic, Dartmouth College is in the USA], 80 university students were asked the question, "How many children do you want to have?" The results of surveying general opinion were as follows:

People who want none ... 1 person
Only one person ... 2 people
Only two people ... 38 people
About two or three ... 19 people
Only three people ... 15 people
About three or four ... 3 people
Only four people ... 6 people
About four or five ... 1 person
Only five people ... 3 people
About five or six ... 1 person
Up to ten people ... 10 people <34>

**Summary**

This short news piece reports the results of a survey conducted among 80 university students at Dartmouth University (mistakenly placed in England) regarding their desired number of children. The overwhelming preference was for two children (38 students), followed by "two or three" (19 students) and exactly three (15 students). Smaller numbers preferred one, four, or five children, while one student wanted none, and a notable group of 10 students desired up to ten children. For historians, this article reflects a contemporary interest in social trends and family planning, even referencing a Western survey within a Korean publication during the colonial period. It potentially highlights changing attitudes towards family size, possibly influenced by Western ideas filtering into Korea, contrasting with traditional norms, and provides a snapshot of desired demographics among an educated group (albeit foreign students cited as an example).
