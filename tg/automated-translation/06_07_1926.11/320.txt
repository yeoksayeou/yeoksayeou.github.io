Oh ah oh ah, Narikoljal gathers all, Kobi Onmamu, Paedal Nara (Nation), build the bridge, Koljalnŏna, Kami koi (Longing for God), Narihanbaegeum, Narihanbaegeum. <98>

**Summary**

This poem, titled "Divine Song," is written in a deliberately obscure and archaic-sounding Korean, possibly incorporating invented words or phrases alongside recognizable terms. It reads like a chant or incantation invoking figures like "Narihanbaegeum," "Mamu," and others, calling for gathering and connection ("establish the bridge"). Significantly, it invokes "Paedal Nara," an ancient name for Korea, and incorporates the phrase "Kami koi," likely borrowed from Japanese ("longing for God/spirit"). From a historical perspective, the poem is interesting for its attempt to evoke ancient Korean identity ("Paedal Nara") during the colonial period, possibly as a form of cultural resistance or assertion. However, the blend with a Japanese spiritual phrase ("Kami koi") is peculiar and might suggest syncretism, influence from Japanese new religions, or a complex interaction between cultures under colonialism. The obscure language itself could be a way to express esoteric religious ideas or nationalist sentiments in a coded manner.
