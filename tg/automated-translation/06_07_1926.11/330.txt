Two Great Divisions of the Ancient Korean People, A Glimpse into Ancient Korean History Research
						An Chasan (安自山)

1. Introduction

The framework of ancient Korean history (上古 朝鮮史) is not only something upon which scholars' opinions still do not align, but it is also extremely difficult to research. Why is this? Because the ancient period of any country's history is invariably unclear. In the case of Korean history too, records concerning the ancient period are faint and disorganized, making it very awkward to discuss. However, the value of research lies in tackling difficulties. If we now re-examine it with new research, it will be quite interesting, and we can also come to understand what the ancient life of us Koreans was like.

Based on my current research, I consider that the ancient Korean people (上古의 朝鮮民族) were divided into two major branches (二大派). The first branch spread across Manchuria (滿洲) and the Peninsula (半島), living in scattered villages (곤달곤달의 부락). The second branch put down roots in the great plains of Liaoyang (遼陽大野), wrestled with the Han people (漢族), and eventually penetrated deep into Han territory (漢地) to live. I have named the former the East Korean People (東朝鮮族) and the latter the West Korean People (西朝鮮族), and I intend to discuss this briefly using these designations.

2. The East Korean People

The East Korean People are also called the Original Korean People (本朝鮮族). These are the tribes originally spread across Manchuria and the Peninsula, divided into the four major groups of Puyŏ (扶餘), Suksin (肅愼), Yemaek (濊貊), and Chin'guk (辰國). Among these, the Yemaek were originally in Puyŏ but gradually pushed southward in a ㄱ-shape, residing in the northeastern region. Chin'guk existed in a ㄴ-shape across the western and southern parts of the Peninsula, later dividing into the Three Han: Mahan (馬韓), Chinhan (辰韓), and Pyŏnhan (幷韓).

The *Hou Han Shu* (後漢書) states regarding the Ye (濊): "They call themselves the same race as Kuryŏ (句驪). Their language, laws, and customs are largely similar. Their character is simple and honest."
The *Sanguo Zhi* (三國志) states regarding Puyŏ (扶餘): "The text on their seal says 'Seal of the King of Ye (濊王之印).' In the state, there is an old fortress named Yesŏng (濊城), presumably the original land of the Yemaek (濊貊)."
The *Hou Han Shu*, Chronicle of Han (韓傳), states: "There are three types of Han (韓), totaling seventy-eight states... Each is situated among mountains and seas, the land spanning over four thousand *li* square... To the east and west, the sea forms the boundary. All are the ancient Chin'guk (辰國)."

These statements about the origins of the Yemaek and about Chin'guk are truly discoveries from new research. Other matters have been agreed upon since before, so there is no need to chatter on about them now. I will stop here and bring up the matter of the West Korean People.

3. The West Korean People

Since criticizing the uncertain words of others is not worthwhile, I will not critique other theories. I will specifically count and relate the historical traces of the West Korean People.

Originally, the Han people (漢人) referred to Easterners as Yi (夷) and recorded nine types. Among these, the U'i (嵎夷) were a large tribe based in Liaoyang (遼陽). What are the U'i? They are Koguryŏ (고구려). The ancient pronunciation of U'i (嵎夷) is 'Kuri' (구리), which is simply another transcription of Kuryŏ (句麗). These U'i engaged in major struggles with the Han people, then split into two. One group entered Puyŏ (扶餘), pushed out the Yemaek (濊貊), established Koguryŏ (高句麗), and gradually moved south to build Paekche (百濟). Another group was highly active in the Ch'ŏngju (靑州) region, then gradually moved towards the south of the Central Plains (中原), establishing various states and living along the Huai River (淮水邊地). During the time of King Mu of Zhou (周穆王), they briefly<99> established a large state. Evidence for this exists in various places, as shown in the text below.

*Shiji Zhengyi* (史記正義): "When the U'i (嵎夷) were subdued... U'i is Ch'ŏngju (靑州). Yao ordered Xizhong (義仲) to manage the eastern region, the land of the U'i in Ch'ŏngju, where the sun rises, called the Valley of Yangming (陽明之谷)."
*Shang Shu* (尚書): "The sea and Mount Dai defined Qingzhou (靑州). The Yu Yi (嵎夷) were subdued."
*Hou Han Shu* (後漢書): "The *Wangzhi* (王制) says the East is called Yi (夷)... There are nine kinds... When the virtue of the Xiahou clan (夏后氏) declined, the Yi people began to rebel... When Jie (桀) acted tyrannically, various Yi invaded internally. Tang of Yin (殷湯) started a revolution, attacked, and pacified them. Reaching Zhong Ding (仲丁), the Lan Yi (藍夷) revolted... From then on, sometimes submitting, sometimes rebelling, for over three hundred years... When Wu Yi (武乙) declined, the Eastern Yi (東夷) gradually strengthened, eventually splitting and moving to the Huai (淮) and Dai (垈) regions, increasingly occupying the central lands (中土)... Later, the Xu Yi (徐夷) usurped the title [of king], leading the Nine Yi (九夷) to attack the Zong Zhou (宗周), reaching west to the Yellow River (河上). King Mu (穆王), fearing their growing power, divided the eastern feudal lords and appointed King Yan of Xu (徐偃王) as their leader... When Chen She (陳涉) raised troops, the realm fell into chaos. Wiman (衛滿) of Yan (燕人) fled to Chosŏn (朝鮮) and became king of that country. After over a hundred years, Emperor Wu (武帝) destroyed it. At this time, the Eastern Yi (東夷) first began relations with the capital."

The claim that Kija (箕子) became the king of Chosŏn (朝鮮王) is related to this West Korean People; I declare that it has absolutely nothing to do with the East Korean People. The evidence is as follows.

*Sancai Tuhui* (三才圖會): "Kija (箕子) led five thousand people from China (中國) and entered Chosŏn (朝鮮)."
*Han Shu* (漢書): "When the way of Yin (殷道) declined, Kija (箕子) left for Chosŏn (朝鮮) and taught its people rites and righteousness (禮義)."
*Liaodong Zhi* (遼東志): "Liaodong (遼東) was the land transformed by Kija's passage (箕子過化之邦)."
*Liang Shu* (梁書): "Among the countries of the Eastern Yi (東夷之國), Chosŏn (朝鮮) was the greatest, having received the civilizing influence of Kija (箕子之化)."
*Sui Shu* (隋書): "The land of Koryŏ (高麗之地) was originally the state of Kochuk (孤竹國). During the Zhou (周) era, Kija (箕子) was enfeoffed there."
*Jiu Tang Shu* (舊唐書): "The land of Liaodong (遼東之地) was the state of Kija (箕子之國) during the Zhou (周)."

After Kija, there was the rule of Wiman (衛滿) of Yan (燕人), whose third generation fell to the Han (漢). [Some group related to this?] entered Chin'guk (辰國) and became the King of Chin (辰王). One branch [of the West Koreans] invaded the central lands (中土) and was highly active, namely King Yan of Xu (徐偃王). Who was this King Yan? He was an egg-born child (卵生兒), possessing the same kind of legend as the various founders of the East Korean People's states. He practiced benevolent rule (仁義之政), unified over 30 states, and built a great, albeit temporary, kingdom.

*Shiji Qin Benji Zhengyi* (史記秦本記正義) citing *Bowuzhi* (博物志): "A palace lady of the Lord of Xu (徐君) became pregnant and laid an egg. Considering it inauspicious, it was abandoned by the water. A dog belonging to an orphaned mother named Hukchang (鵠蒼) found the abandoned egg and brought it back, warming it. It hatched into a small child named Yan (偃). When the palace lady heard of this, she took him back and raised him. When he grew up, he succeeded as Lord of Xu (徐君)..." The *Xiahou Zhi* (夏侯志) says: "In Wengzhou (翁州), there is the fortress of King Yan of Xu (徐偃王城). Tradition says that in the past, King Mu of Zhou (周穆王) toured his domains, and the feudal lords together revered King Yan (偃王)."
*Huainanzi*, Renjian Xun (淮南子人間訓): "In the past, King Yan of Xu (徐偃王) loved to practice benevolence and righteousness (仁義). Thirty-two states came to his court by land."
*Wenxian Tongkao* (文獻通考): "Shu Yan (舒偃) had the surname Zi (姓子) and the rank of Viscount (爵), located in Shu County, Lujiang (盧江舒縣)... Shu Jiu Yan (舒鳩偃) had the surname Yan (姓偃) and the rank of Viscount, a separate enfeoffment of Shu (舒之別封)... South of Lujiang, there is Shu Fortress (舒城), [land of the] Eastern Yi (東夷也)."
*Ibid*, Qingzhou section (同靑州條): "The sea and Mount Dai defined Qingzhou (海垈惟靑州). The Yu Yi (嵎夷) were subdued (嵎夷旣畧). Shun (舜) divided Qingzhou to make Guanzhou (管州), establishing governors (牧) in both. During the Zhou (周), Xuzhou (徐州) was combined with Qingzhou (靑州), making its territory larger. Its rivers were the Huai (淮) and Si (泗). In the Spring and Autumn period (春秋時), five verifiable states existed: Qi (齊), Ju (莒), Lai (萊), Mou (牟), Tan (譚)... During the Qin (秦), it was divided into commanderies: Sanqi Commandery (三齊郡), Langya Commandery (瑯琊郡), Liaodong Commandery (遼東郡)."

Looking again, what was the life of the West Korean People like? They utilized the advantages of their land (土之利勢), sustaining themselves through pastoralism (牧畜) and agriculture (農業). Their culture, so to speak, was Sŏn (仙 - immortal/sage culture). This Sŏn art (仙術) formed the core thought of the East (東洋). The yearning of the Central Plains (中原) for divine immortals (神仙) was entirely focused on and sought around the Liaoyang (遼陽) region. Therefore, many practitioners of the Way of Divine Immortals (神仙の道術家) were also in the Liaoyang region. This Sŏn thought (神仙の思想) entered East Korea (東朝鮮) on the one hand, and also shaped the literary thought of Original Korea (本朝鮮) for thousands of years.

*Chi Shi Hong Shi*? (池氏鴻史): "Fuxi's (伏羲氏) name was Cang Ya (蒼芽). He was called the Blue Essence (蒼精), thus titled the Spring Emperor (春皇). His mother was Hua Xu (華胥氏). He became Emperor among the Nine Yi (九夷). He revealed the three lines [of trigrams] and established the eight trigrams (八卦)."
*Guicang* (歸藏): "The Yellow Emperor (黃帝) traveled east to Ch'ŏnggu (靑丘), passed Mount P'ung (風山), met Master Zifu (紫府先生), and received the *Sanhuang Neijing* (三皇內文) to carve the names of the myriad spirits (萬神)."
*Tushu Jicheng* (圖書集成): "The Great Way (大道) emerged in the East (東) but its fundamental lineage arose in the North (北). The *Yi* (易) says: 'The Emperor emerges from Zhen (震).' Zhen is the East (東方也)."

However, although the West Korean People fiercely competed with the Han people, they could not seize the entire territory of the Central Plains. Nevertheless, in terms of thought, they held sway over the Han lands. This Sŏn thought (神仙思想) spread among high and low, leaving no one untouched. Even figures like Qin Shi Huang (秦始皇) and Emperor Guangwu of Han (漢光武) were caught up in the Way of Sŏn (仙道) and flustered. Ordinary scholars and poets (文士 詩人) too fell under the spell of Sŏn, disregarding state and family, immersing themselves solely in the pleasure of mountains and waters (山水の樂), prioritizing carefree wandering (無事閑遊). How can this not be called the intangible success of the West Korean People? This truly warrants deep research.

4. The Condition of the East Korean People<100>

While the West Korean People contended with the Han people, they adopted Han culture and artifacts (文物) and transmitted them to the East Korean People. The Eastern People (東族) absorbed this culture and gradually grew stronger. Consequently, there was a time when they occupied nearly half of the West Korean People's base. This is easy to understand by searching through the *Samguk Sagi* (三國史記) and the *Lulong Xianzhi* (盧龍縣志).

*Lulong Xianzhi*, Record of the City God Temple (城隍廟記): "Eastward, all of Liaoning (全遼) was covered. During over two hundred years of peace, the people did not know war (兵革). Recently, the Three Han (三韓) have caused trouble. East of Guangning (廣寧), [the land] has nearly become desolate (甌脫). Along the single line of Yuguan (楡關), alarms [lit. wind and cranes] constantly startle. Requisitions and rotations of generals make life unbearable for the people (民不堪命). Officials in this land only wish to survive along with the fortress, not just viewing the fortress as their own body (不翅以身 視城矣)."
*Sui Shu* (隋書): "Koryŏ (高麗) was originally the state of Kochuk (孤竹國). During the Zhou (周) era, Kija (箕子) was enfeoffed there. In Han (漢) times, it comprised three commanderies (三郡). The Jin (晉氏) also controlled Liaodong (遼東). Now, it does not submit, being a separate foreign territory (外域)."
*Fengshan Shu Zhengyi* excerpt (封禪書正義節文): "The old fortress of Kochuk (孤竹故城) is twelve *li* from Lulong County (盧龍縣) in P'yŏngju (平州). During the Yin (殷時), it was the feudal state of Kochuk (孤竹國)."

During this time, the West Korean People also crossed eastward with their Sŏn arts (仙術) and founded states on many occasions. Therefore, the legends of the founders (創業主) all transformed into Sŏn tales (仙說). The founder of Koguryŏ (高句麗 始祖) was a Sŏn; the legend of Silla's founder (新羅 始祖) is also Sŏn; the founders of Kaya (加耶), T'amna (耽羅), etc., are all divine immortal narratives (神仙の說話). Not only that, but many place names were also borrowed from that side. The "Han" (韓) in Samhan (三韓) comes from Han people (韓人), who were of the same lineage as Qin (秦), coming to live in Chin'guk (辰國), hence it was translated as Han'guk (韓國). Kuwŏl Mountain (九月山) is also a mountain name from Tŭngju (登州); P'yŏngyang (平壤) is a place name from Liaoyang (遼陽); Ŭiju (義州) is likewise. However, after the Three Kingdoms period, the East Korean People split into Northern and Southern parts. The Northern part is what came to be called Manchuria (滿洲). Those northern tribes grew increasingly strong and began to annex the Central Plains (中原). The first time was as the Jin (金), occupying the northern half of the Central Plains. More recently, they occupied the entire Central Plains, established the Qing Dynasty (淸國), and arguably reached a point where it could be said they finally achieved the long-held aspiration (宿願) of the West Korean People.

*Shiji Qin Benji Zhengyi* (史記 秦本記正義): "Han prefecture in Tongzhou (同州韓地縣) shared ancestry with Qin (秦). In the 22nd year of Duke Mu of Qin (秦穆公), he destroyed it."
*Ibid*, Han Shijia Zhengyi (同韓世家正義): "Han Fortress (韓城) was the ancient state of Han (古韓國). *Gujin Diming* (古今地名) says: Viscount Wu of Han (韓武子) held his fief (食采) at Han Yuan, where the fortress was."
*Hou Han Shu* (後漢書): "Elders of Chinhan (辰韓耆老) claim to be people who fled Qin (秦之亡人) to escape harsh labor service (苦役) and went to Han'guk (韓國). Mahan (馬韓) ceded land on its eastern border to them. Some call it Chinhan (秦韓)."
*Shangshu Zhuan*, Kongshi Shu (尙書傳 孔氏疏): "馯 is the same as Han (韓). The sound is the same, but the character is different (音同而字異也)."

The explanation concludes here, but I will elaborate further when I have the opportunity in the future (End). <101>

**Summary**

The author, An Chasan, argues that the ancient Korean people (Kojosŏn minjok) were divided into two main branches: the "East Korean People" (or "Original Koreans") who inhabited Manchuria and the Korean peninsula (Puyŏ, Yemaek, Chin'guk/Samhan), and the "West Korean People" (identified with the U'i/Kuryŏ) originating near Liaoyang. He posits that this Western group heavily interacted with the Han Chinese, split, with one part migrating south into Korea (founding Koguryŏ and Paekche) and another moving into China proper (associated with King Yan of Xu). Kija and Wiman are linked to this Western branch. The author emphasizes the "Sŏn" (immortal/sage) culture as characteristic of the Western branch, influencing both China and the founder myths of Korean states. He controversially frames the later Jurchen (Jin) and Manchu (Qing) conquests of China as the ultimate fulfillment of the "West Korean People's" historical aspirations.

From the perspective of Korean colonial history, this article is interesting as an example of nationalist historiography attempting to construct a grand, autonomous narrative for Korea, extending its origins deep into Manchuria and challenging Sinocentric frameworks. The clear division into "East" and "West" Koreans, the specific identification of the "West Koreans" with groups interacting significantly with China, and the claim that later Manchurian conquerors fulfilled "West Korean" destiny offer insights into how Korean intellectuals in the 1920s sought to redefine Korean identity and historical scope, potentially as a counter-narrative to Japanese colonial interpretations that often minimized Korea's historical agency and connection to the continent. Historians might find the author's unique ethno-historical framework and his interpretation of classical Chinese sources to support it particularly revealing of the intellectual currents of the time.

古朝鮮民族의 二大別, 朝鮮古代史硏究一端
						安自山
1. 내두리
上古 朝鮮史의 차짐새는 아직 학자네의 마새가 일치치 못할 뿐 아니라 그것을 연구하기 가장이 어려운지라 어찐 일이냐 하면 何國의 역사던지 그 上古에는 모도 똑똑지 못해. 朝鮮史도 上古에 잇서서는 기록이 희미하고 갈피가 어수선하여 말하기가 매우 거북한지라. 그러나 연구의 가치는 어러운대 잇는 것이라 지금 우리가 새로운 연구로써 한 번 제겨 보면 취미도 만흐며 또한 우리 조선인의 고대생활이 어떠한 것을 가히 알 것이라.
時方 나의 연구로 말하면 上古의 朝鮮民族은 二大派로 난우어 진 것으로 思惟하노니 제1파는 滿洲 밋 半島에 퍼저 곤달곤달의 부락을 지어 살던 것이오. 제2파는 遼陽大野에 뿌리를 박고 漢族과 씨름하다가 필경 漢地에 深入하여 살던 것이니 前者는 東朝鮮族, 後者는 西朝鮮族이라 命名하여 노코 그 명칭으로써 조곰 논술코자 하는 일이라 하노라.

東朝鮮族은 달리 本朝鮮族이라고도 이름을 부티다녀 이는 원래 滿洲와 半島에 퍼저잇는 족속이니 扶餘, 肅愼, 濊貊 辰國의 四大部로 별러 잇서서. 其中에 濊貊은 본시 扶餘에 잇다가서 차차 ㄱ字형으로 밀려 나려와 東北의 지방에 잇던 것이요. 辰國은 半島의 서방과 남북에 ㄴ字형으로 잇섯던 바 追後에 馬, 辰, 幷 三韓으로 난우어진 것이니
後漢書 濊 自謂 與句驪同種 言語法俗 大抵相類 人性愚慤
三四志 扶餘 其印文言 濊王之印 國有古城 名濊城 蓋本濊貊之地
後漢書韓傳 韓有三種 凡七十八國 各在山海間地 合方四千餘里 東西 以海爲限 皆古之辰國也
이 濊貊의 근본과 辰國에 대한 말은 참 新硏究의 發覺이요. 其外의 것은 기왕부터 一致되어 오는 것이니 지금 다시 喋喋할 필요가 업서 고만 그치고 西朝鮮族의 일을 끄내고저 하노라.

3. 西朝鮮族
남들의 불확실한 말은 탄할 것이 아닌 고로 他說을 평론할 것은 아니요. 나는 특히 西朝鮮族의 史跡을 세어 말하노라.
본래 漢人이 東方人을 夷라 하여 九種으로 적어 나려온 바 其中에 嵎夷라 한 것은 遼陽에 근거하던 大族이라. 嵎夷가 무엇이냐 하면 고구려니 嵎夷의 古音은 (구리) 곳 句麗의 異譯이라. 이 嵎夷가 漢族과 씨름을 크게 하다가 둘루 난우어서 一은 扶餘로 들어와 濊貊을 밀어내고 高句麗를 세우고 차차 남으로 나려서서 百濟를 건설한 자라. 또 一은 靑州地方에서 크게 활동하다가 차차 中原의 南方으로 向하여 淮水邊地에서 여러나라를 세우고 살다가 周穆王때에 잠시간＜99＞ 큰 국가를 세웟스니 이 증거는 下文과 가티 여러군데 잇나니라.
史記正義 嵎夷旣畧 嵎夷靑州也 堯命義仲 理東方靑州嵎夷之地 日所出處 名曰陽明之谷
尙書 海垈 惟靑州 嵎夷旣畧
後漢書 王制云東方曰夷O有九種O夏后氏失德 夷人始叛O桀爲暴虐 諸夷內侵 殷湯革命 伐而定之 至于仲丁 藍夷作冠 自是 或服或叛 三百餘年 武乙衰退 東夷寢盛 遂分遷淮垈 漸居中土O 後 徐夷僭號 乃率九夷 以伐宗周 西至河上 穆王 畏其方熾 乃分東方諸候 命徐偃王 主之O陳涉起兵 天下慣亂 燕人衛滿 避之朝鮮 因王其國 百有餘歲 武帝滅之 於是 東夷始通上京
箕子가 朝鮮王이 되엇다 함은 이 西朝鮮族과의 관계요. 東朝鮮族과는 하등의 아랑곳이 업는 줄로 단언하노니 그 증거는 下文과 가트니라.
三才圖會 箕子 率中國五千人 入朝鮮
漢書 殷道衰 箕子去之 朝鮮 敎其民以禮義
遼東志 遼東 爲箕子過化之邦
梁書 東夷之國 朝鮮爲大 得箕子之化
隋書 高麗之地 本孤竹國也 周代 以之封箕子
舊唐書 遼東之地 周爲箕子之國
箕子 이후에는 燕人 衛滿의 통치가 잇섯다가 그 三世가 漢에게 亡함이 되어 辰國으로 들어와 辰王이 되어서 그 일파는 中土에 侵入하여 크게 활동하기는 徐偃王이니 그 偃王이 누구냐 하면 東朝鮮族의 여러 創業主와 동일한 傳說인 卵生兒로써 仁義의 정치를 행하여 30餘 國을 통괄하여 일시적의 대국을 건설한 그이라.
史記秦本記正義 博物志云 徐君宮人 有娠而生卵 以爲不祥 棄於水濱 孤獨母有犬鵠蒼街所棄卵以歸 覆煖之 乃成小兒生偃故 宮人聞之 更取養之 及長 襲爲徐君 夏侯志云 翁州上 有徐偃王城 傳云 昔 周穆王 巡狩諸侯 共尊偃王
淮南子人間訓 昔 徐偃王 好行仁義 陸地之朝者 三十二國
文獻通考 舒偃姓子爵 在盧江舒縣 舒鳩偃姓子爵舒之別封 盧江南 有舒城東夷也
同靑州條 海垈惟靑州 嵎夷旣畧 舜分靑州 爲管州 皆置牧 周以徐州 合靑州 其土益大 川曰淮泗 春秋時 可考者五國 齊莒萊牟譚O秦時爲郡 三齊郡瑯琊郡遼東郡
다시 보아 西朝鮮族의 생활은 어떠터냐 하면 이는 그 토지의 利勢를 取하여 牧畜과 농업으로써 자뢰하여서, 그 문화라 할 것은 仙이니 이 仙術은 東洋의 중심사상을 지은 것이라. 中原이 神仙을 사모하기는 전혀 遼陽지방의 언저리를 표준하여 갈구한 것이라. 고로 神仙의 道術家도 만히 遼陽지방에 잇서서, 그 神仙의 思想이 一方으로 東朝鮮으로 들어와 또한 本朝鮮의 수천년 문학사상을 매즌일도 잇나니라.
池氏鴻史 伏羲氏 名曰蒼芽 是謂蒼精故 號春皇 母華胥氏 爲帝於九夷 兆三畵著八卦
歸藏 黃帝東到靑丘 過風山 見紫府先生 受三皇內文 以刻名萬神
圖書集成 大道著手東 而本統起乎北易曰 帝出乎震 震東方也
그런데 西朝鮮族이 몹시 날처 한족과 각축하엿스되 그 中原의 全土를 앗지 못하여서. 그러나 思想上으로는 漢地를 통괄한 세음이니 그 神仙思想은 上下에 퍼저 누구던지 미치지 안흔이가 업서서. 秦始皇 漢光武 가튼 이도 仙道에 미처 허둥거렷스며 일반 文士 詩人들도 仙의 催眠에 빠저 국가도 不顧, 家族도 不顧, 오직 山水의 樂에 주잔저 無事閑遊를 爲主하엿스니 이 어찌 西朝鮮族의 무형한 성공이라 아니할까 이것은 실상 기피 연구하여 볼 거리니라.

4. 東朝鮮族의 形止＜100＞

西朝鮮族이 漢族과 겨러본 동안에 漢人의 文物을 取하여 東朝鮮族에게 傳及하니 東族은 그 문물을 섭취하면서 점점 강성하여 나가서. 그리하여 西朝鮮族의 근거지를 반이나 점령한 일이 잇스니 이는 三國史記와 盧龍縣志를 뒤저 보아도 알기 쉬운 일이니라.
盧龍縣志 城隍廟記 東以全遼並蔽 承平二百餘年 民不識兵革 邇來三韓發難 廣寧以東 幾成甌脫 楡關一線 風鶴時驚 供億輪將 民不堪命 吏於玆土者 惟願與城俱存 不翅以身 視城矣
隋書 高麗 本孤竹國也 周代 以之封箕子 漢世 爲三郡 晉氏 亦統遼東 今來不臣 別爲外域
封禪書正義節文 孤竹故城 在平州 盧龍縣十二里 殷時諸侯孤竹國也
그리할 둥안에 西朝鮮族은 仙術을 가지고 東方으로 넘어와 國業을 창설한 일도 만흐니 그럼으로 創業主의 전설은 모도 仙說로 化하여서. 高句麗 始祖도 仙이요. 新羅 始祖의 전설도 仙이요 加耶, 耽羅 등의 始祖도 다 神仙의 說話러라. 그뿐 아니라 地名도 역시 그 便의 것을 떼어 쓴 것이 만흐니 三韓의 韓이라 한 것은 秦의 同族이던 韓人들이 辰國에 와서 살므로써 譯하여 韓國이라 한 것이요. 九月山도 登州의 山名, 平壤도 遼陽의 地名이요 義州도 亦然이라. 그런데 東朝鮮族이 三國 이후에는 南北 2部로 갈라저 버렷스니 北部는 滿洲라 명칭한 것이 그것이라. 그 북방족속은 점점 강성하여 中原을 倂呑하기 시작하니 제 1차는 金이라하여 中原의 북반부를 점령이엿섯고 최근에는 中原全土를 점령하여 淸國을 세워 필경 西朝鮮族의 宿願을 伐成하엿다하기 可하다할만콤 되엇나니라.
史記 秦本記正義 同州韓地縣 與秦同祖 秦穆公二十二年 滅之
同韓世家正義 韓城 古韓國也 古今地名云 韓武子 食采於韓原地城也
後漢書 辰韓耆老 自言 秦之亡人 避苦役 適韓國 馬韓 割東界地與之 或名之爲秦韓
尙書傳 孔氏疏 馯 卽韓也 音同而字異也
