Old Poems

*Map of the Eastern Country* (東國地圖) from *Hwagyyejip* (花溪集)
A single map of the country east of the peninsula hangs,
Unrolled upon the wall, everything looks just as it was.
Three hundred prefectures are scattered like stars or Go stones,
Thousands of roads where waters merge and mountains divide.
Military camps ring the outer borders, the vassal buffer states firm,
The capital centrally located, the terrain advantageous.
This is Cheonggu (靑丘), land of ceremonial robes and cultural artifacts,
May we preserve this golden vase (金甁) and pass it down for myriad generations. <79>

*Also, Same as Above*
There is another, east of the East Sea in Samhan (三韓),
A map on the wall, like those of Jing (荊) and Yi (益) known to the ancients.
Do not say this vine-covered land (藤國) is remote and small,
How many heroes reside herein!

*Indignation* (不平) from *Yi Sanggukjip* (李相國集)
The barbarian bandits (胡虜) run rampant, the whole nation grieves,
Who are you to harbor private sorrows?
While even a square inch of loyal heart (丹心) remains,
Though they speak of retirement (懸車), how could I possibly rest?

*Lament* (感傷) from *Pahanjip* (破閒集)
Recently hearing the neighboring country's situation grows perilous,
Now is the time to expand territory and open borders.
My white hair flutters like falling frost and snow,
My loyal heart (丹心) burns bright, known to ghosts and gods.
Lian Po (廉頗) could still eat much, not without reason,
Huo Qubing (去病) left his home, also with purpose.
Silently, this feeling has nowhere to be spoken,
Whenever I encounter a wine barrel, I get drunk as mud.

*Reading History* (讀史) from *Sagajip* (四街集)
Who was worthy, who was wicked—all is public opinion,
Whether one leaves a stench or fragrance, neither deceives.
I report to you, master, look with clear eyes:
Gain and loss, past and present, depend on human action. <80>

**Summary**

This article presents five classical Chinese poems (Hansi) written by Korean scholars from different historical periods, sourced from various collections. The poems cover themes of national geography and pride (Map of the Eastern Country), the potential within Korea despite its size (Also, Same as Above), indignation against foreign threats and unwavering loyalty (Indignation), lament over national crisis and personal aging coupled with unresolved patriotic fervor (Lament), and reflections on the importance of human agency in history (Reading History). In the context of 1926 colonial Korea, publishing these historical poems, which express strong patriotism, lamentation over national weakness or crisis, and calls for resolve and recognition of national potential, would likely resonate deeply with contemporary readers. Historians might find this selection interesting as a subtle form of expressing nationalist sentiments and historical consciousness under censorship, using classical forms to voice contemporary frustrations and aspirations.
