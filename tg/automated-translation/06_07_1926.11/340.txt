The Advent of Hanbaennim

In the darkness of the whole world,
There was no life branching properly,
As a new dawn's light reddened and rose,
Brightness unfolds.
All come to life.
They laugh.
Hanbae, Hanbae, Hanbae, our Hanbae!
The Lord of light and life.

Amidst the light clouds of the stretched-out peaks,
A song of heaven rings out.
A beautiful child with a clear voice
Calls out high.
The stars receive it.
They laugh.
Hanbae, Hanbae, Hanbae, our Hanbae!
The Lord of light and life. <101>

**Summary**

This poem celebrates the arrival of "Hanbaennim," a revered figure depicted as the source of light and life, transforming a dark world into one of brightness and vitality. The verses describe the dawn breaking the darkness, bringing life and laughter, and a heavenly song echoed by a child and the stars, all praising Hanbaennim. From a historical perspective, the poem, published in 1926 during the Japanese colonial period, likely reflects the beliefs of Daejonggyo or similar nationalist-religious sentiments. "Hanbaennim" typically refers to Dangun, the mythical founder of Korea, revered as a god. The poem's theme of light overcoming darkness and the restoration of life can be interpreted as an allegorical expression of hope for national liberation and revival through reverence for a foundational divine figure, making it interesting for historians studying cultural and religious resistance under colonialism.
