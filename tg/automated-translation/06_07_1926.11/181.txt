Establishment of a Correction Department

Many submissions arrive from readers. Reviewing them one by one takes time, but leaving them unattended feels apologetic to those who wrote with sincerity. Therefore, we have established a Correction Department with the following regulations.

Correction Department Regulations

1.  Write the manuscript on one side only, leave ample margins, and mark "Correction" (添削) in red on the envelope (皮封).
2.  Write your address and name at the end of the manuscript.
3.  Enclose 10 *chŏn* (十錢) (by postage stamp (郵票) or money order (爲替)) per manuscript page (20 characters x 10 lines). (This covers the correction fee (添削料) and return postage (返送費)).
4.  Manuscripts will be corrected, critiqued (批評), and returned within 30 days of arrival.
5.  If registered mail is required for return, attach an additional 10 *chŏn* for the registration fee (登記料).
6.  The company (本社) does not take responsibility for loss due to mail (郵便) or natural disasters (天災).
7.  Outstanding works (佳作) among the submissions may be published in this magazine (本誌).

Selectors: Yi Kwangsu (李光洙), Chu Yohan (朱耀翰)

**Summary**

This announcement from *Donggwang* magazine establishes a new manuscript correction service for reader submissions. It outlines the procedures, including manuscript preparation, a fee of 10 *chŏn* per 200-character page for correction and return postage (payable via stamps or money order), a 30-day turnaround time, an option for registered return mail, a disclaimer for lost mail, and the possibility of publication for excellent submissions. The selectors for this service are noted as the prominent literary figures Yi Kwangsu and Chu Yohan. For historians, this article offers insight into the practical operations of a colonial-era Korean magazine, its interaction with aspiring writers, the cost and methods of payment for services, and the active role played by established writers like Yi and Chu in cultivating new literary talent within the constraints of the period. It reflects the development of a public literary sphere and the mechanisms for feedback and potential publication available to readers.
