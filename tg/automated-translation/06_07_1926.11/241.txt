Autumn
						Yu To-sun

It is a fearful autumn.
My beloved, though this life is like dew,
Pray for blessings upon it.
For my poor home,
Loading days of peace onto a cart,
Together with my sister, I will go out to the fields
To harvest the ripe grain.

It is an autumn for striving.
My beloved, though this body is like a blade of grass,
Pray only that it be strong.
For the crumbling foundation of my house,
Taking the hands of village comrades, pulling them along,
Climbing the mountain, shouting out,
Gathering stone fragments from the old fortress walls,
I will rake the fallen oak leaves.

It is an autumn of love.
My beloved, though this heart is like a clod of earth,
Pray that it not be in vain.
For my pitiful brethren,
Beating the *bujanggu* drum,<74>
Singing the mournful song of lost friends,
I will make tears fall even on the reddened maple leaves.

Mountain Stream Water

By a single mountain stream, I sat alone;
The world's tumultuous thoughts
Are fleeting like the mist.
The pine trees standing tall all around
Are my friends who have left the dust behind.

Trickle, trickle flows the mountain stream water.
From within the breast of Great Nature,
It is water like a welling-up heart,
So the spirit of lonely tranquility, without end,
Has long, long been cast upon it.

Morning and evening,
Washing their bodies in the dew, riding the moonlight,
The mountain birds of this peak wander timelessly.
Even the ascetic practices of Jesus
Cannot compare to these birds drinking this water.

Clear as clear can be,
And incomparably clean is the mountain stream water.
Reciting a song that washes away impurities,
Along with mushrooms picked from the mountain,
I intend to offer it before you, my beloved.
――September 10th――<75>

**Summary**

This article presents two poems by Yu To-sun. The first poem, "Autumn," portrays the season as a time of fear, hard work, and sorrowful love. The speaker seeks blessings for survival, resolves to work with family and community to gather resources and rebuild ("crumbling foundation," "old fortress walls"), and expresses deep empathy for suffering brethren, lamenting with music. The second poem, "Mountain Stream Water," contrasts sharply, depicting nature—specifically a mountain stream—as a pure, tranquil escape from worldly troubles, offering spiritual solace superior even to religious asceticism, and concluding with an offering of this natural purity. From a colonial history perspective, "Autumn" is particularly revealing. It reflects the hardships likely faced by Koreans under Japanese rule – poverty, decaying infrastructure ("crumbling foundation," "old fortress walls" could be metaphorical or literal decay), and collective suffering ("pitiful brethren"). The emphasis on community action ("village comrades") and the blend of hope and lament suggest resilience amidst difficult circumstances. The contrast with the escapism into pristine nature in the second poem might also reflect a desire to find solace away from the harsh realities of colonial society.

가을
						劉道順
두려운 가을이로소이다.
님이여 이슬 가튼 목숨이나
福을 빌어 주소셔.
가난한 나의 집을 위하여
平和의 날을 수레에 싯고
누나의 함 들에 나아가
익은 곡식을 거두오리다.

힘쓸 가을이로소이다.
님이여 풀닙 가튼 몸이나
튼튼만 하랍소서.
너머져가는 집터를 위하여
마을의 동모를 손잡아 고
산에올라 소리하며
날근 성의 돌조각을 주며
갈닙을 글그오리다.

사랑의 가을이로소이다.
님이여 흙덩어리 가튼 마음이나
헛되지 말랍소서.
불상한 내형제를 위하여
부장구를 솟구며＜74＞
구슬픈 금벗노래를 울퍼
붉어진 단풍 닙에도 눈물이 지게
하오리라.

山間水
한줄기 山間水에 외로히 안젓스니
세상에 뒤훔큰생각
안개가티 속절업고
우우 둘러션 솔나무
을 난 내 벗이외다.

돌돌돌 흐르는 山間水.
大自然의 가슴속에서
샘 솟는 마음가튼 물인지라
孤寂한 靈氣가 한말도 업시
길이길이 들이웟사외다.

아침과 저녁
이슬에 몸 싯고 달비츨 타고
업시 거니는 이산의 멧새님들
에수님의 修道도
이물을 마시는 새만은 못할것외다.

맑기도 맑으려니와
하기로 더할라우 업는 山間水오니
더러움 시츤 노래를 을퍼
산에서  버슷과 함
님의 아페 들이려나이다.
