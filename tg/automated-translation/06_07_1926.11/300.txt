A Small Discovery of Tangun Historical Material and My Joy, An Aspect of Ancient Korean History Research
						Chang Tobin

1. The Accuracy and Authority of the Tangun Koki (檀君古記)

It is a well-known fact that the Tangun Koki is primarily based on what is recorded in the *Samguk Yusa* (三國遺事) (compiled by Iryŏn (一然) over 700 years ago). However, it is also a fact that about a hundred years prior to that, the *Samguk Sagi* (三國史記), authored by Kim Pusik (金富軾), used the Koki (古記, Old Records) as its greatest foundational source in compiling the *Samguk Sagi*. This is evident from seeing "Koki ŭn" (古記云, The Old Records say...) clearly noted in various places throughout the *Samguk Sagi*, and at the same time, in Kim Pusik's memorial submitted to King Injong (仁宗) (the preface presented upon submitting the *Samguk Sagi*), the phrase "The Koki are crude in writing..." (古記는 文字蕪拙...) is clearly recorded, indicating that the *Samguk Sagi* is a book revised and compiled by Mr. Kim based on the Koki. Among these, the Tangun Koki is also recorded in the *Samguk Sagi*, specifically in the Koguryŏ Annals (高句麗紀), entry for King Tongch'ŏn (東川王), where it states, "P'yŏngyang (平壤) was originally the dwelling of the divine man Wang'gŏm (神人王儉)." This corresponds to the record in the Tangun Koki stating that Tangun established his capital in P'yŏngyang. Mr. Kim, being a scholar-official (not a monk as sometimes misinterpreted, though Confucian scholars often avoided supernatural topics), had the foolish thought of not speaking of strange powers or disorderly spirits (怪力亂神), and at the same time, since it was the *Samguk Sagi* (History of the Three Kingdoms), there was little need to clearly record the history of Tangun. Therefore, Mr. Kim truncated the Tangun history, recording only "P'yŏngyang was originally the dwelling of the divine man Wang'gŏm" (平壤 本 神人王儉之宅). However, this Tangun Koki mentioned above passed through Koguryŏ records. This can be known by looking at names in the Koki such as Asadal (阿斯達), Pisŏgap (匪西岬) (that he became a god in Asadal, that he took the daughter of Habaek (河伯) of Pisŏgap as his queen). This is because 'Tal' (達) was used by Koguryŏ people to refer to a mountain, and 'Kap' (岬) was used by Koguryŏ people to refer to a coastal mountain (e.g., Chunghwa (中和) was called Kahwa Kap (加火岬), Song'ak (松獄) was called Pusogap (扶蘇岬)). In relation to this, I wish to propose the small fact that constitutes my so-called discovery.

2. The So-called Small Discovery is Truly Infinitely Interesting

When I traveled near Kuwŏl Mountain (九月山) some years ago, I paid attention at the time and sought clear evidence for Asadal as recorded in the Tangun Koki, but it was not an easy task. During that time, while passing through Munhwa (文化) (now merged into Sinch'ŏn County 信川), I recalled that the old name for Munhwa was Kyŏlgu (闕口). Comparing this with the Koki's statements that Tangun moved his capital to Asadal and became a god in Asadal, and at the same time recalling that Munhwa County was Kyŏlgu during the Koguryŏ period, I suddenly realized something. 'Ku' (口) is a noun used by Koguryŏ people to refer to the entrance of a sea inlet or estuary, such as calling Ŭllyul (殷栗) Yulgu (栗口). Hyŏlgul County (穴口郡, though this name isn't standard, likely referring to a place near Munhwa with caves) was called Hyŏlgu because there is Hyŏlgul Mountain (穴窟山, Cave Mountain), and Yulgu County (栗口郡) was called Yulgu because there were chestnut trees (栗木). Therefore, Munhwa County being called Kyŏlgu (闕口) signifies it was a place corresponding to a coastal inlet near a palace site (闕 = palace gate/palace, 口 = mouth/inlet) (it seems the coast was closer in ancient times than today). The county name 'Ku' was given, and at the same time, because that place was the site of Tangun's palace, it was called Kyŏlgu. This corresponds to the Koki's statement that Tangun moved his capital to Tangjanggyŏng (唐藏京) near Kuwŏl Mountain. Therefore, I clearly recognized that Tangun initially had his capital in P'yŏngyang and later moved to the vicinity of Kuwŏl Mountain in his final years. At the same time, taking one step further, I wondered if Kuwŏl Mountain (九月山) might be a changed name from Kung'hol San (宮忽山). Looking at the *Samguk Yusa* Tangun Koki, which states "Asadal, also named Kung'hol San (弓忽山)..." (阿斯達 一名 弓忽山), 'hol' (忽) is a noun used by Koguryŏ people to refer to a town or settlement (邑) (e.g., Talhol (達忽), Naemihol (內米忽)). <95> I think 'Kung'hol' (弓忽) is a corruption of 'Kung'hol' (宮忽, Palace Town), and at the same time, I think Koguryŏ people also called Kuwŏl Mountain 'Kung'hol San' (宮忽山), meaning the mountain where Tangun's palace was, which later changed to the similar-sounding name Kuwŏl San (九月山). Simultaneously, I considered the noun Asadal (阿斯達) and wondered if the meaning of Asadal might not be precisely 'Kung'hol San'. That is, perhaps 'Asa' (阿斯) was ancient Korean language meaning 'Kung'hol' (宮忽).

3. A Consideration Regarding the Honorific Title of Tangun

It is clear that Japan's Emperor Jimmu (神武天皇) and China's Huangdi Xuanyuan (黃帝軒轅氏) were both titles posthumously bestowed by later generations in those countries. Similarly, in Chosŏn (朝鮮), it is a title posthumously bestowed by later generations. However, due to the weak historical consciousness in ancient Chosŏn, the posthumous conferral of the honorific title Tangun (檀君) was very much delayed compared to other countries. In ancient times, he was simply called Wang'gŏm (王儉), using Tangun's given name directly. From the Three Kingdoms, North-South States, and Koryŏ periods onward, a nationally or ethnically bestowed honorific title is not seen. Only that ancient people called P'yŏngyang Wang'gŏmsŏng (王儉城) was a fine name showing reverence for Wang'gŏm, much like Washington in America or Alexandria (亞歷山港) in Egypt. Finally, in the early Chosŏn dynasty, the honorific title Tangun was established nationally and ethnically. Consequently, official compilations such as *Tongguk Saryak* (東國史略), *Tongguk T'onggam* (東國通鑑), and *Koryŏsa* (高麗史) clearly record him as Tangun. King Sejong the Great (世宗大王) built the Tangun Shrine (檀君廟) in P'yŏngyang and wrote "Chosŏn Sijo Tangun" (朝鮮始祖檀君, Founding Ancestor of Chosŏn, Tangun) on the spirit tablet (位牌). Later, King Sejo the Great (世祖大王) changed the writing at the Tangun Hall (檀君殿) in P'yŏngyang to "Chosŏn Sijo Tangun chi wi" (朝鮮始祖檀君之位, The Spirit Tablet of the Founding Ancestor of Chosŏn, Tangun), adding the two characters 'chi wi' (之位). King Sŏngjong the Great (成宗大王) wrote "Tangun chi wi" (檀君之位, The Spirit Tablet of Tangun) at the Samsŏngsa (三聖祠, Shrine of the Three Sages) on Kuwŏl Mountain.

[The following appears to be a quote from *Sindan Silgi* (神壇實記)]
Hwanin (桓因), Hwanung (桓雄), and Hwan'gŏm (桓儉) are the Three Gods (三神). On the 3rd day of the 10th month in the Kapcha year of the Upper Yuan cycle, Hwan'gŏm transformed from a god into a human, held the Three Heavenly Seals (天符三印), and descended beneath a sandalwood tree (檀木) on Mount T'aebaek (太白山) (present-day Paektu Mountain 白頭山). He then established divine teachings (神敎) and taught the people. At this time, the people were transformed and gathered like a market, hence the name Sin Sumin (神市民, Divine City People). He then established 3,000 districts (三千團部). In the 125th year of Kaech'ŏn (開天, Opening of Heaven), the Munjin year (戊辰), on the 3rd day of the 10th month, the people of the country acclaimed the divine man and made him Imgŏm (壬儉, Ruler). This was Tangun (檀君). The country was named Tan (檀). (Also called Paedal 倍達). He married the daughter of Habaek (河伯) of Pisŏgap (匪西岬) as his queen and sired the crown prince Puru (扶婁). During a great flood, he commanded P'eng U (彭虞) to manage the mountains and rivers and settle the people's dwellings. He had Sinji (神誌) manage writing (書契) and Kosi (高矢) manage agricultural affairs (田事). In the 147th year, Kyŏngin (庚寅), he moved the capital from T'aebaek to P'yŏngyang (平壤) and changed the country's name to Chosŏn (朝鮮). In the 191st year, Kapsul (甲戌), he dispatched Crown Prince Puru to attend the assembly at Mount T'u (塗山會) of Yu of the Xia dynasty (夏禹氏) (beginning of diplomatic relations). He enfeoffed his branch son(s) in Puyŏ (扶餘). He made Yŏ Suggi (余守己) the chieftain of Ye (濊君長) and had his nine sons separately manage various commanderies. He made P'ich'ŏn Saeng (裶天生) the chief of the southern seas (南海上長). He established an altar for sacrifices to Heaven (祭天壇) (the altar is on Mani Mountain 摩尼山 in Kanghwa 江華) and built Samnang Fortress (三郞城). (The fortress is on Chŏndŭng Mountain 傳灯山 in Kanghwa). Later, he moved the capital to Tangjanggyŏng (唐莊京). (The capital is in Munhwa 文化, present-day Changjangp'yŏng 莊莊坪). In the 217th year, Kyŏngja (庚子), on the 15th day of the 3rd month, he entered Mount Asadal (阿斯達山) (present-day Kuwŏl Mountain 九月山 in Munhwa) and transformed into a god, ascending to Heaven (化神御天). It was the 217th year since Kaech'ŏn; he was on the throne (在君位) for 93 years; it is unknown for how many generations [his line] was transmitted; it spanned 1,212 years. There are shrines (祠) at both T'aebaek and Asadal. (*Sindan Silgi* 神壇實記) <96>

**Summary**

Chang Tobin argues for the historical validity of the Tangun Koki (Old Records of Tangun), citing its presence in the *Samguk Yusa* and its subtle inclusion in Kim Pusik's *Samguk Sagi*. He presents his "discovery" linking the ancient name Kyŏlgu (闕口, identified with Munhwa near Kuwŏl Mountain) to Tangun's later capital, Asadal, through linguistic analysis of Koguryŏ place name elements ('Ku' for inlet, 'Kyŏl' for palace). He further speculates Kuwŏl Mountain derives from 'Kung'hol San' (Palace Town Mountain), also mentioned as a name for Asadal, suggesting Asadal itself meant 'Kung'hol'. The article concludes by tracing the formal adoption of the title "Tangun" in the early Chosŏn dynasty and quotes a passage from the *Sindan Silgi* detailing Tangun's divine lineage, reign, accomplishments, and ascension. From the perspective of Korean colonial history, this article is significant as an effort by a Korean intellectual to assert the depth and historicity of Korea's foundation myth during Japanese rule. Chang Tobin's attempt to ground the Tangun narrative in specific geography and linguistic evidence, and the detailed account from *Sindan Silgi*, reflect a nationalist desire to construct a distinct and ancient Korean identity counteracting colonial narratives. Historians might find the specific geographical and linguistic arguments, the discussion of the Tangun title's evolution, and the reliance on texts like *Sindan Silgi* interesting for understanding early 20th-century Korean historiography and nationalism.

檀君史料 一小發見과 余의 喜悅, 朝鮮古代史硏究一端
						張道斌
1. 檀君古記의 正確과 그 權威
檀君古記는 三國遺事(7백여년 전, 一然의 撰)에 기재된 것을 主함은 世人 周知의 사실이라. 그러나 그가 그보다 약 백여년 전, 舍富軾 著作의 三國史記에도 古記로 최대 근본자료로 하여 三國史記를 편성한 것이 사실이니 그는 三國史記에 곳곳이 『古記云』을 明記함을 보아 분명한 동시에 金富軾의 上에 上 仁宗表文 (곳 三國史記를 進한 箋)에도 가로되 『古記는 文字蕪拙...』 운운의 구절이 明載한 것을 보면 三國史記는 곳 김씨가 古記를 수정편성한 一書라. 그런 중에 檀君古記를 三國史記에도 기재하있나니 곳 高句麗紀 東川王條에 『平壤은 本 神人王儉의 宅』이라 한 것이 是라. 그는 곳 檀君古記에 檀君이 平壤에 都하었다는 것을 記함에 김씨는 僧者라 怪力亂神을 不語한다는 痴想이 있는 동시에 또 三國史記임을 檀君史로 明記할 필요도 적은 때문으로 김씨는 檀君史記를 거두절미하여 다만 『平壤 本 神人王儉之宅』이라 記하였음이로다. 然而 右檀君古記는 高句麗人의 기록을 經한 것이니 그는 古記에 阿斯達, 匪西岬(阿斯達에서 神이 되시었다는 것, 匪西岬 河伯의 女로 后를 삼앗다는 것) 등 명칭을 보면 可知할찌라. 곳 達은 高句麗人이 산을 지칭하고 岬은 高句麗人이 海邊의 산을 지칭(中和를 加火岬, 松獄을 扶蘇岬) 한 명사인 때문이로다. 玆에 관련하여 소위 余의 발견이라는 小事實을 提言하랴 한다.

2. 所謂 一小發見은 眞是 滋味無限
余가 年前에 九月山 부근에 遊할새 당시에 유의하여 檀君古記 所載 阿斯達의 明證을 得코저 하었으나 용이한 일이 아니었다. 그 중에 우연히 文化(今 信川에 合郡)를 過하면서 文化의 古號가 闕口인 것을 思하고 檀君이 阿斯達에 移都하었다는 것, 阿斯達에서 神이 되었다는 古記를 대조하는 동시에 文化郡이 高句麗時代의 闕口이던 것을 念及하니 余는 恍然히 覺한바 있었다. 곳 口라는 것은 高句麗人이 海浦入處를 지칭한 名詞니 殷栗을 栗口라 한 것 등이 是라. 곳 穴口에는 穴窟山이 잇슴으로 穴口라 하엿고 栗口郡에는 栗木이 있음으로 栗口라 한 것이라. 그런데 文化郡을 闕口라 한 것은 곳 宮闕터 있는 연안 포구에 상당한 곳임으로 (고대에는 금일보다 여안이 近하였던 모양) 口라는 郡名을 짓는 동시에 그 곳은 檀君의 宮闕터이던 고로 闕口라 한 것이라. 곳 所謂 檀君이 구월산 부근 唐藏京에 移都하였다는 古記에 부합하는 것이라 그럼으로 余는 분명히 檀君이 初에 平壤에 都하였다가 말년에 九月山 부근에 移都하였다고 認하였다. 동시에 또 一步를 進하여 구월산이 곳 宮忽山의 變稱인가 思하였다. 그는 三國遺事 檀君古記에 『阿斯達 一名 弓忽山』 운운한 것을 보면 忽은 高句麗人이 邑을 지칭한 名詞(達忽, 內米忽 등)니＜95＞ 忽은 곳 宮忽의 와전인줄로 思하는 동시에 高句麗人이 九月山을 또한 檀君宮殿 있던 산이라 하여 宮忽山이라 하던 것이 후세에 그와 相似한 音 곳 구월산으로 된 줄로 思하였다. 동시에 余는 阿斯達의 명사까지 念及하여 혹은 阿斯達이라는 의의가 곳 宮忽山이라는 것이 아니었는가 思하였스니 곳 阿斯가 宮忽이라는 意 있는 古代 國語가 아니던가 한다.

3. 檀君 尊號에 關한 一考
일본의 神武天皇이니 중국의 黃帝軒轅씨가 다 그 나라 후세인이 追尊한 명칭 됨이 분명하다. 그와 같이 朝鮮도 후세인이 追尊한 명칭이다. 然而 朝鮮 고대에 史的 觀念이 박약함으로 檀君 尊號의 追稱이 매우 他國의 그것보다 遲晩하였다. 고대에는 다만 王儉이라 稱呼하여 檀君의 名字를 그대로 불럿고 三國, 南北國, 高麗 이래로 국가적,  민족적으로 추존한 칭호를 不見하였다. 다만 古人이 平壤을 王儉城이라 한 것은 마치 미국 워싱톤, 埃及 亞歷山港처럼 王儉을 숭배한 好名稱이었다. 그리하다가 마침내 조선 초엽불어 檀君이라는 존호를 국가적, 민족적으로 확정하였다. 이에 東國史略, 東國通鑑, 高麗史 등 官撰 書籍에 檀君으로 明記하고 세종대왕이 평양에 檀君廟를 建하고 位牌에 『朝鮮始祖檀君』이라고 書하였다. 그 후 世祖大王이 平壤 檀君殿에 『朝鮮始祖檀君之位』라고 改書하여 之位 2자를 加入하였다. 成宗大王은 九月山 三聖祠에 『檀君之位』라고 書하였다.

桓因 桓雄 桓儉이 是爲三神이시니 上元甲子 10월 3일에 桓儉이 以神化人하야 持天符三印하시고 降于太白山(今 白頭山) 檀木下하야 乃設神敎而敎民하시니 時에 人民이 被化하야 歸者-如市함으로 有神市民之稱이라 乃寘三千團部하시다. 開天 125년 戊辰 10월 3일에 國人이 推戴神人하야 爲壬儉하니 是爲檀君이시라. 國號를 檀이라 하시다.(稱號 倍達) 娶匪西岬河伯女하사 爲后하시고 生太子扶婁하시다. 當洪水하야 命彭虞하사 治山川하야 奠民居하며 神誌로 掌書契하며 高矢로 治田事하시다. 147년 庚寅에 自太白으로 移都平壤하사 改國號하야 朝鮮이라하시다. 191년 甲戌에 遣太子扶婁하야 往夏禹氏塗山會하시다(交際之始)封支子于扶餘하시며 以余守己로 爲濊君長하야 使其子九人으로 分掌諸郡케하시며 以裶天生으로 爲南海上長하시다. 設祭天壇하시며(壇在江華摩尼山)築三郞城하시다. (城在江華傳灯山)後에 徙都唐莊京하시다(京在文化今莊莊坪) 217년 庚子 3월 15일에 入阿斯達山(今文化九月山)하사化神御天하시니 開天이 217년이오.在君位가 93년이요 傳不知幾世요. 歷1212년이라 太白과 阿斯達에 皆有祠하니라. (神壇實記) ＜96＞
