One
Sparse maples on the mountainside; Sŏnggŏ Pass (聖居關) is over there.
My body enters a painting; even if a dream, isn't it fine?
Driver, don't rush the car; I am brimming with excitement.

Two
Rounding a bend, a sudden squall in the clear sky turns violent.
The waterfall hanging in mid-air already glimmers in my eyes.
My heart may not be hurried, but I delight that I will see it soon.

Three
As the four mountains recede, the angered waters are magnificent!
The 150-foot black stone cliff is gloomy even in broad daylight.
The depth of the indigo (藍) pool is unknown; perhaps a dragon resides there (龍)?

Four
Blowing out a fierce wind, it turns back and forth, this way and that.
Suddenly, a crystal screen (水晶簾) becomes lumps upon lumps of snow (雪).
Timeless mist in the valley seems to fall like drizzling rain.

Five
Descending with spears held high; what dance is this in tasseled, sweat-soaked robes (流蘇汗衫)?
A reed organ mixed with thunder, intermittently, sounds of jade (玉聲).
Where did they say the myriad forms (萬物肖) were? I wonder if it is here.

Six
How many heroes have passed by? Who were the peerless beauties?
How lamentable (惆悵)! Like that flowing water, could they not linger?
On the boulder, lovely grass script (草書); I lament not knowing the names.

Seven
The narrow mountain path beside the pavilion; how many times have I climbed the forgotten steps (稱代)?
Through the dark, ancient rainbow gate (古關虹蜺), what comes and goes are wind-blown leaves (風葉).
Even if rise and fall have their count (數), can sentiment also know a count?

Eight
Naturally drunk on the superb view, I just sit down at a tavern (酒家).
The sparse shadows of the trees; the whole sky seems like water.
Ah! Has the moon fled? I shall go see the night waterfall.

Nine
The moon (月) is high in its place, but why is the waterfall even more urgent?
Climbing Pŏmsa Pavilion (泛槎亭), heaven above and earth below, only the sound of water.
Though they say the burdens of human life (人間累) are heavy, what else remains?

Ten (Thinking of the Ch'anggang River)
The poetic hero (詩雄) who sang "Bright moon, fall from heaven and fly"—where has he gone now?
Those strangely unique whiskers and eyebrows (鬚眉), I suddenly long for them.
Though my own verse may have its concerns (念), I am sad because I cannot make him hear.

**Summary**

This ten-stanza poem by Chŏng Inbo describes a journey to and reflections at Pakyon Falls, a famous natural site in Korea. The poet expresses awe at the landscape's beauty and power, evokes imagery of nature's force (wind, rain, waterfall), and muses on the passage of time, history, and the transience of human life compared to the enduring scenery. The final stanza laments the absence of the great Chinese poet Li Po, expressing a longing for connection with past artistic grandeur. From a historical perspective, the poem is interesting as an expression of appreciation for Korean natural heritage by a prominent nationalist intellectual during the Japanese colonial period. Celebrating such iconic Korean landscapes could be interpreted as a subtle act of cultural resistance or affirmation. The reflections on past heroes and the lament for a lost connection to greatness might also resonate with the contemporary colonial context.

朴淵行
						鄭寅普
其一
山허리 드믄 丹楓 聖居關이 저기로다
畵幅에 몸이 드니 꿈이란들 안좋으냐
運轉手 車몰지마소 내 興겨워 하노라

其二
한구비 도라들제 晴天風雨 急히 돌려
半空에 걸린 瀑布 눈에 발서 어리인다
맘아니 바쁘리마는 곳보일가 젛어라

其三
四山이 물러서니 성낸 물결 壯할시고
百五尺 검은 石壁 한낮에도 陰森하다
쪽(藍)빛못 깊이 모르니 龍게신가 하노라

其四
狂風을 부러내고 되불리어 이리저리
어느덧 水晶簾이 덩이덩이 눈(雪)이로다
洞中에 때없는 안개 비나리듯 하여라

其五
槍들고 나리닷다 流蘇汗衫 어인 춤고
雷聲에 섞인 笙簧 드문드문이 玉聲이라
萬物肖 어대라더뇨 나는옌가 하노라

其六
지나니 몇 英雄고 絶代佳人 누구누구
惆悵타 저물같이 머무를수 없엇던가
바윗동 어여쁜 草書 이름몰라 하노라

其七
亭子옆 좁은 산길 잊은 칭대 몇번든고
어둑헌 古關虹蜺 드나들손 風葉이라
興亡이 數잇다 한들 情도 數를 알리까

其八
絶景에 절로 醉코 酒家에 거저앉아
성길사 나무그림 온 하늘이 물같고나
어즈버 달아나신가 夜瀑구경 가리라

其九
달(月)이야 제높것만 瀑布어이 더 急한고
泛槎亭 올라서니 天上天下 물소리뿐
人間累 重하다한들 남은 무엇잇으리

其十(滄江을 생각하고서)
明月 墮天飛라든 詩雄이제 어대간고
古怪튼 그 鬚眉가 불연드시 그리워를
내 풍월 염잇으리만 못들리니 슬워라＜14＞
