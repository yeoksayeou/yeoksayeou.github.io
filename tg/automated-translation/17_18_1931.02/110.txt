Recitations Beyond the Sickbed
						Chŏn Mu-gil

Though I ponder the ten thousand ways a person cannot be free,
Is the freedom lost to a sick body the foremost? I wonder.
Even heroes and great figures of ages past are but names when they fall.

But how could one know they would shine after death?
On the old site of Jerusalem's four walls, only weeds run riot,
Yet even today, it strikes the heart, awakening sick souls.

As there isn't a single worldly affair I could achieve as intended,
I had decided to live casting off worries and anxieties,
But at the shouting young voices, I set my purpose anew.

When the frost comes and leaves fall, who knew they would live again?
But if only the spring light shines, flowers bloom and sprouts shoot forth.
Could the principle for you, body that received this land's spiritual energy (靈幾), be different?
- From Sŭmnakche (習樂齊) - <26>

**Summary**

This poem, written from a sickbed, reflects on the loss of freedom due to illness, comparing it to the transience of historical heroes and the desolation of places like Jerusalem. However, the speaker finds renewed hope and purpose inspired by "shouting young voices" and the cyclical regeneration observed in nature (spring following winter). The poem concludes with a hopeful assertion that the speaker's body, imbued with the spirit of the land, will also experience renewal. From a historical perspective, the poem's themes of confinement, suffering, lost potential, and eventual hope for revival resonate strongly with the Korean experience under Japanese colonial rule in 1931. The juxtaposition of personal illness with national/historical decline (Jerusalem) and the yearning for regeneration, possibly spurred by a younger generation, offers historians insight into the subtle ways nationalistic sentiment and resilience were expressed despite censorship.

病床吟外
						全武吉
사람의 自由몯됨 千萬가지 헤어봐도
病든 몸 잃은 自由 우뜸일까 하노매라
千古의 英雄豪傑도 슬어지면 이름뿐

그러나 어찌 알꼬 죽어저서 빛낼 줄을
예루살렘 넷城터엔 雜草들만 어지럽건
오늘도 염통을 쏘네 병든 넋들 깨우리

世上일 어느 하나 뜻 둔 대로 몯이뤗기
찰하리 시름근심 버리고나 살잿드니
웨치는 젊은 소리에 다시 내 뜻 세우네

찬서리 잎떠룰젠 다시 살줄 뉘 아드냐
봄빛만 쏘아오면 꽃도 피고 싹만 트네
이 땅의 靈幾받은 몸 너내 理致 다르리
