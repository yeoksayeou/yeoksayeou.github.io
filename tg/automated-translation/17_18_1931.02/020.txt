**Summary**

This short piece, likely captions for photographs, announces the appointment of new leaders in four prominent Korean organizations in early 1931: Kim Pyŏngno for the Singanhoe (a nationalist umbrella group), Cho Sinsŏng for the Kŭnuhoe (a women's organization closely linked to Singanhoe), Chŏng Kwangjo for the Cheondogyo religious movement following its internal consolidation, and Yang Chusam for the newly unified Korean Methodist Church. For historians, this article highlights leadership transitions within key social, religious, and nationalist organizations during the Japanese colonial period. It specifically points to moments of unification or consolidation within both Cheondogyo and the Methodist Church, alongside the continued operation of major nationalist front organizations like Singanhoe and Kŭnuhoe.
