Ascending Tangun Terrace (From the *Ch'ŏnghŏ Collection*)
Clearing the clouds, I ascend the old stones,
Thinking distantly of the ancient emperors.
The mountains' form is solely emerald green;
Human affairs, how many risings and fallings?

Thoughts on the Salsu River (From the *Igye Collection*)
A million Sui soldiers turned to worms and sand,
For a thousand years, white waves rise on the clear Salsu.
The rise and fall of past dynasties are empty water and moon,
Eulji's meritorious deeds fill the mountains and rivers.
Even Chinese and barbarians still recognize the greatness of the Three Han (Samhan),
The fate of the state ultimately depends on its many loyal men.
Alone, I lament the Southern Military Commissioner of times past;
Though a man may die, what of Suiyang?

Kŭmjo (Song for the Zither), Master Paekkyŏl
This is the finest Silla-era classical Chinese poem, discovered in Wŏn Ch'ŏn-sŏk's *Anthology of Figures* (人物叢記).

Heaven bestows upon people, Heaven makes poor or eminent, Heaven grants rulers,
Heaven takes away rulers. Gaining is not market profit, Losing is not injury.
Attaining is not necessarily fortunate, Departing is not necessarily fortunate. Joy is no different joy;
Receiving life from Heaven is itself joy.

Thoughts While Sitting at Night (From the *Mogŭn Collection*)
The world is tumultuous, the clamor of many mouths loud;
Who can quiet the toil of our people?
Lying down, I watch the vastness of the blue sea's wind and waves,
Thinking of hoisting cloud-like sails ten thousand fathoms high.

Untitled (From the *Hakch'ŏn Collection*)
The world is chaotic, people's hearts are broken;
Our group's strength is firm.
I wish to take a single stone
And together mend Nüwa's sky.<78>
<77-78>

**Summary**

This article presents a collection of five classical Chinese poems (Hansi) composed by Korean figures from various historical periods, sourced from different collections like the *Ch'ŏnghŏ Collection*, *Igye Collection*, *Mogŭn Collection*, *Hakch'ŏn Collection*, and Wŏn Ch'ŏn-sŏk's *Anthology of Figures*. The poems touch upon themes of reflecting on history and nature ("Ascending Tangun Terrace"), celebrating national heroes and lamenting political situations ("Thoughts on the Salsu River"), philosophical contemplation on fate and contentment ("Kŭmjo"), frustration with societal turmoil and yearning for action ("Thoughts While Sitting at Night"), and resolve amidst chaos ("Untitled"). For historians, this collection offers insight into the continuity of classical literary traditions in Korea, the enduring significance of historical events like the Salsu victory, and expressions of patriotism and intellectual concerns, published here during the Japanese colonial period, which might subtly reflect contemporary sentiments through historical parallels.
