Article Title:	古時調 二首 (Two Old Sijo Poems)
Author:	禹倬, 李廷藎
Article Type:	시 (Poem)

Holding a staff in one hand,
And holding thorns in the other,
I tried to block the path of aging with thorns,
And strike the coming white hair with the staff,
But the white hair, knowing beforehand,
Came by a shortcut. (U T'ak 禹倬)

Looking anew at the mirror I saw in youth
With white hair,
Youth is nowhere to be seen,
Only white hair appears.
Oh, white hair, could youth have gone by itself?
I suspect it is you who pursued it. (Yi Chŏng-sin 李廷藎) <55>

**Summary**

This article presents two classical Korean sijo poems, one by U T'ak and the other by Yi Chŏng-sin, both reflecting on the theme of aging and the inevitability of growing old, symbolized by white hair. The first poem humorously depicts a futile attempt to physically stop old age, while the second laments the disappearance of youth, suspecting the white hair of chasing it away. The inclusion of these Goryeo/Joseon-era sijo in a 1926 Korean magazine during the Japanese colonial period is significant. It highlights the continued appreciation and preservation of traditional Korean literary forms and cultural heritage, possibly serving as a subtle expression of national identity amidst colonial rule. For historians, it shows the persistence of classical Korean culture in popular print media of the era.

古時調 二首
한손에 막대잡고
또 한손에 가시 쥐고
늙는 길 가시로 막고
오는 白髮 막대로 치려더니
白髮이 제 먼저 알고
지름길로 오더라(禹倬)

청춘에 보던 거울
백발에 고치어 보니
청춘은 간대업고
백발만 뵈는구나
백발아 청춘이 제 갓스랴
네 쪼츤가 하노라(李廷藎) ＜55＞
