**Body Text Translation:**
Apology Notice

Since the previous month's issue, this magazine has endeavored to increase its page count and enrich its content, and the unexpectedly favorable reviews and kind attention from the public (江湖) have truly moved us, the staff of this company, beyond measure. Henceforth, we intend to redouble our efforts with even greater sincerity to live up to, even in the smallest measure, the expectations of general society.

However, the reason the page count for this month's issue has been reduced compared to what was planned is that several articles, including the character profile "Elder Yi Sŭnghun (李昇薰翁)," were unexpectedly subjected to deletion. This was fundamentally beyond the reach of human power (人力), so we ask for your deep understanding.

Furthermore, the previously announced "Esperanto (에스페란토)" course has been postponed to the New Year issue due to editorial circumstances. From the New Year issue onwards, we also plan to include several other interesting courses besides this, so please anticipate that it will become good reading material helpful for practical benefit (實益) and self-cultivation (修養).<94>

**Summary**

This editorial notice from *Tonggwang* magazine apologizes to readers for the reduced page count in the December 1926 issue. It explains that this reduction was unavoidable because several articles, most notably a profile of Yi Sŭnghun, were censored ("deleted"). The editors express gratitude for positive reader feedback on recent improvements and promise continued efforts. They also announce the postponement of a planned Esperanto course until the New Year issue, which will feature additional new columns aimed at practical benefit and self-cultivation. The most historically significant aspect is the explicit mention of censorship ("deletion") of specific content (the Yi Sŭnghun profile), directly referencing the constraints placed on publishing under Japanese colonial rule. This provides concrete evidence of the pressures faced by Korean periodicals during this era.

謝告
本誌는 前月號붙어 紙數增大, 內容充實을 厲行하여온 바 分에 넘치는 江湖의 熱評이 의외에 眷注하와 本社同人은 진실로 감격하여 견디지 못하는 바외다. 이 앞으로는 더욱 성의껏 倍加奮勵하여 일반사회의 촉망을 만일이라도 仰副하고저 하나이다. 그런데 本月號는 紙數가 예정보다 이렇게 축소된 것은 인물평론 李昇薰翁 이외 數篇이 의외에 삭제를 당하게 된 까닭이외다. 이가 原是 인력의 所及이 아니오니 깊이 양해하여 주소서. 또 이미 예고한 「에스페란토」강좌는 편집사정상 新年號로 밀우엇사오며 그러고 新年號붙어는 이밖에 취미있는 강좌 여럿을 두려하오니 實益과 修養을 資賴함에 好讀物이 될 것을 豫諒하소서.＜94＞
