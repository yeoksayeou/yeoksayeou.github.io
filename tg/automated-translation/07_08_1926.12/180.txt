**Summary**

This news article announces the establishment of the "Chŏngŭmhoe" (正音會), a society dedicated to the research and popularization of the Korean language and writing system. It states the society's founding coincides with the anniversary of the promulgation of Hunminjŏngŭm (the original name for Hangul) by King Sejong on the 29th day of the 9th lunar month, 1446. The society is based at the Kyemyŏng Club in Insadong, Kyŏngsŏng (Seoul), and lists prominent figures of the time as committee and standing committee members. For historians, the article is significant as it documents a key moment in the organized Korean language movement during the Japanese colonial period (1910-1945). The list of committee members, including well-known intellectuals and nationalists, highlights the broad support and importance attached to preserving and promoting the Korean language and script under colonial rule, despite assimilation pressures.
