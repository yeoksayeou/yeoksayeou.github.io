June
Softly swaying willow branches, each one is June,
What do the golden bells (Gaenari) in the garden announce?
The sound of the cuckoo on the distant mountain evokes sorrow.

The yellow ox lying under the sun, striking its tail, is leisurely,
A couple of butterflies flutter, flutter, dancing,
Now and then, they land on a flower, forgetting how to fly again. <81>

Spring in a Farming Household
The lovely "melody" of the lark,
The cheerful crowing of the daytime rooster,
The sound of children's willow pipes...
Turning its back on this springtime "symphony,"
Inside the dark room, oppressed by gloom,
Only heavy breaths are mocked!

On the cold ondol floor, only rising dust remains.
Yet the spring sunlight is gentle,
Even through the cracked ceiling, sunbeams filter in,
But they are people crushed by spring poverty (春窮),
On their gaunt faces, even their eyes are clouded!

Bees fly over beautiful flowers,
Ant swarms come and go over the golden earth.
They are all subjects of a holy kingdom,
Able to live if they work,
Plowing fields, tilling paddies, whatever else, plus untimely forced labor (부역),
These people struggle until their bones bend.
Has such a kingdom been established for them too?
Thinking about it, this riddle of being unable to live even when working,
Is surely a sin created only by cunning people.

Though it's just a wretched hut where smoke from the chimney has ceased,
A pair of swallows, perhaps seeking their old nest,
As if mourning bygone days,
Alight on the crumbling eaves,
Chirping heartbreakingly, then flee.
Departing swallow, you may have no place to stay, but
Where is the place for the owner of this house, who left seeking a way to live? <82>

**Summary**

This publication presents two poems by Hinsŏl. The first, "June," is a Sijo depicting the tranquil beauty of early summer nature – willows, flowers, a cuckoo, an ox, and butterflies – evoking a sense of peacefulness mixed with underlying melancholy. The second, "Spring in a Farming Household," starkly contrasts the vibrant sounds and sights of spring outdoors with the grim reality inside a poor farmer's home, marked by darkness, dust, and the inhabitants' gauntness due to "spring poverty" (Ch'un'gung). It laments the paradox of farmers working relentlessly, including forced labor (puyŏk), yet being unable to survive, attributing this "riddle" to the "sin" of the cunning. The poem concludes with the desolate image of swallows returning to an abandoned, ruined house, symbolizing the displacement of its impoverished owner. From a colonial history perspective, the poems are revealing in their depiction of rural poverty (Ch'un'gung) and the mention of "untimely forced labor" (부역), reflecting the harsh economic conditions and exploitative labor practices faced by Korean farmers under Japanese rule. The contrast between nature's indifference and human suffering, along with the critique of social injustice causing poverty despite hard work, would be of significant interest to historians studying the social realities and critical sentiments of the period.

						힌솔
六月
실실히 느린 버들 가지마다 6월일네
뜰 앞에 개나리는 긔 무엇을 알리는다
먼 산에 벅국이 소리 수심 자아 내고녀

볓 아레 꼬리치며 누은 황소 한가롭다
나븨 두어 마리 너훌너훌 춤„ 추다
이따금 꽃에 앉으면 다시 날 줄 모르네 ＜81＞

農家의 봄
종달새의 어여뿐 『멜로디』
낮닭의 흥겨운 울음,
아해들의 버들피리 소리...
이 같은 봄날의 『씸포니』를 등지고
컴컴한 방 속에는 우울에 짓눌린
무거운 숨결만 비앝는고나!

싸늘한 구들장엔 떠오르는 몬지 뿐.
그래도 봄 볓은 살틀하야
왕틈 난 천정에도 해ㅅ발이 스미것만,
春窮에 눌린 백성이라
기름 빠진 얼골에는 눈동자도 흐리엇고나!

아름다운 꽃 우에 벌들이 날고,
황금 빛 흙 우에 오가는 개미 떼.
그들은 모다 일하면 살 수 잇는,
거륵한 왕국 백성이어니,
밭부침, 논가리, 무엇무엇 게다가 때아닌 부역까지
뼈가 휘이도록 허덕이는 이따의 백성.
그들에게도 그러한 왕국 이루워젓든가?
생각노니, 일하고도 못 사는 이 수수꺽기는,
꾀 잇는 사람 만이 낳아 놓은 죄악이외다.

굴독에 연긔도 끊어진 막서릴망정,
행여나 옛 둥지 찾으려든 제비 한 쌍.
지나간 날을 조상함인지,
묺어저 가는 처마 끝에 앉고,
애끊게 죄자리고 다러나나니,
떠나는 제비야 멈을 곧 없으리만,
살길을 찾어 간 이 집주인의 몸둘 곧은 어데이드뇨.＜82＞
