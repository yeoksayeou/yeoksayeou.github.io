Poems and Songs of Yi Sunsin

Night Recitation on Hansan Island

In the water country, autumn light darkens,
Startled by cold, the wild goose flock flies high.
With a worried heart, tossing and turning through the night,
The waning moon shines on bow and sword.

On a bright moonlit night on Hansan Isle, climbing and sitting atop the watchtower,
While stroking my great sword, deep in thought,
From somewhere, the sound of a Qiang flute deepens my sorrow.

Swearing an oath to the sea, the fish and dragons are moved;
Pledging to the mountains, the grass and trees know.

Sword Inscription (1)
With this three-foot sword, I swear to Heaven; mountains and rivers tremble.

Sword Inscription (2)
With a single sweep, eradicate them; mountains and rivers turn to blood.

(The poems and songs composed by Chungmugong Yi Sunsin are probably all included above.) <1>

**Summary**

This article from the July 1931 issue of *Tonggwang* presents a small collection of poems and verses attributed to Admiral Yi Sunsin (posthumously Chungmugong), a revered Korean naval commander from the Joseon Dynasty. It includes a famous Hanja poem ("Night Recitation on Hansan Island"), a Sijo (a traditional Korean poetic form) on a similar theme composed on Hansan Island, two couplets expressing determination, and two powerful sword inscriptions. The article concludes by suggesting this might be the entirety of Yi Sunsin's known poetic works. For historians studying colonial Korea, the publication of works by Yi Sunsin, a figure symbolizing Korean resistance against foreign invasion (specifically Japan in the 16th century), in a Korean magazine during the Japanese colonial period (1910-1945) is significant. It reflects a subtle assertion of national identity and remembrance of a historical hero during a time of suppressed nationalism.

李舜臣의 詩와 歌
閑山島 夜吟
水國秋光暮, 驚寒雁陣高, 憂心輾轉夜, 殘月照弓刀.

閑山섬 달 밝은 밤에 戍樓에 올라앉아
큰 칼 어루만져 시름하던 차에
어디서 羌笛 한 소리 내 시름을 돕나니.

誓海魚龍動, 盟山草木知.
釰銘(一)
三尺誓天, 山下動色.
釰銘(二)
一揮掃蕩, 血梁山下.
