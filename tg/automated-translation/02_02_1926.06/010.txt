Author: 한샘
Article Type: 시 (Poem)

Laying down the shadows of many mountains one by one,
Though it goes its unimpeded way with abandon,
If the share is even a little shallow, it cries, becoming rapids.

Stones and streams sweeping away the small dreams of villages,
Gathering deep, that itself, dream upon dream,
Countless ones gather, they say, to become the sea.

What makes you so busy, not knowing how to rest?
Once you go where you must, to the sea, strike one blow and come,
I fear you cannot control the self you raised with such effort.
-May 6th, Passing Samnangjin, On the Train-<1>

**Summary**

This poem, written by Hansaem while on a train passing Samnangjin, uses the Naktong River as a central metaphor. The river's journey reflects life's course, overcoming obstacles but showing vulnerability in shallow places. It gathers smaller streams (dreams), merging into a greater entity aiming for the sea, representing collective aspirations or a larger goal. The final stanza questions the river's relentless rush towards the sea, pondering if reaching the ultimate destination might lead to a loss of the self that was painstakingly developed along the way. From a historical perspective, the poem offers a glimpse into personal contemplation and observation of the Korean landscape during the colonial period. The imagery of the powerful river striving towards the sea, yet potentially losing itself, could subtly resonate with broader themes of national identity or the pressures of modernization and external forces during that era.

洛東江을 나려다 보면서
						한샘
뭇뫼의 그림자를 차례차례 잡아 깔며,
막는 이 없는 길을 맘놓고 가건마는,
좀애나 얕은 몫지면 여흘되어 울더라.

마슬의 작은 꿈을 쓸어오는 돌과 시내,
모이어서 깊은 저것 또 그대로 꿈의 꿈을,
수 없는 이들이 모이어 바다되다 하더라.

무엇이 저리 바쁘어 쉬울 줄도 모르시나,
가기 곳 바다로 가 한 통 치고 가온 뒤면,
모처럼 키우었던 저를 못 거눌가 하노라
