How well-equipped and paradise-like are the prisons (i.e., jails) in Europe and America (毆米)! It is said they have hygienic facilities and recreation halls, and recently, at a concert organized by inmates in a certain British prison, a love song (戀愛歌) arose, and the great applause of the entire hall (滿堂) shook the prison house (獄屋).<104>

**Summary**

This news brief reports on the perceived high quality of prisons in Europe and America, describing them as well-equipped with hygienic facilities and recreation areas, almost like paradise. It highlights a recent event in a British prison where inmates held a concert featuring a love song, which received great applause, shaking the prison walls. From a historical perspective, this article is interesting for its idealized portrayal of Western penal systems, likely contrasting starkly with the conditions experienced by Koreans in Japanese colonial prisons. It reflects a contemporary interest in, and perhaps admiration for, Western modernity and standards, even in the context of incarceration.
