Recently, it is said that an elderly woman (孃) in America (米國) invented a way to cover a baseball with a single piece of covering, reportedly having gotten the idea by applying the principle of a tangerine peel while peeling a tangerine. <16>

**Summary**

This short news brief reports on an American invention: a method for covering a baseball with a single piece of material, inspired by the shape of a tangerine peel. The inventor is described, somewhat unusually, as an "elderly young lady" (노령의 孃). From a historical perspective, the article reflects the growing awareness and adoption of Western culture, specifically baseball, in colonial Korea during the 1920s. It also shows interest in Western technological innovation, even in seemingly mundane areas like sports equipment manufacturing.
