**Title: On Orchids**
						Kim Okyŏn
Spring waters of Yongsŏng are greener than oil,
In the sound of fine rain, I grieve silently.
It has been ten years since I parted from that person,
Casually writing of fragrant grass, tears stream down my face.
(Yongsŏng is the old name for Songgang)

**Two Harmonizing Poems Sent by Mr. Chu Mu-chae of Shaoxing, Zhejiang, Inscribing an Old Orchid Painting of Mine**
By the Same Author (Kim Okyŏn)

Pent-up frustration turns my feelings to the orchids of the Nine Fields (九畹花),
Rivers and mountains stretch ten thousand li, separated by distant clouds.
Relying on you, sir (馮君), do not send such heartbreaking verses,
In dreams, I hear only the reed pipes of the borderlands.

By the Same Author (Kim Okyŏn)

Foul winds and bloody rains (腥風血雨) invade everywhere,
Only the national fragrance (國香) speaks of past and present.
The frosty blade (霜鍔) is temporarily hidden deep in its scabbard,
Taking up the brush, I purposefully write of the heart of the Chu official (楚臣心).

**Appending the Original Rhymes**
By Chu Mu-chae

Dispelling feelings, I still paint ink orchids,
Through eternal spring breezes, how distant is Cathay (華)?
I send word to my old home (故園) not to look back,
Seeing the rivers and mountains (河山) like this, I feel the sorrowful pipes (悲笳).

By the Same Author (Chu Mu-chae)

One scroll of the Li Sao (離騷) brings a hundred invading emotions,
In the deep calamities of the dusty sea (劫深塵海), the ancient is still the present.
Casually washing clean the writing brush (毛錐子),
I paint not rosy cheeks (紅顔) but a pure heart (素心).

**On Orchids, Thinking of Mr. Yu from Afar**
Kim Okyŏn

The rain in Jiangnan (江南) is bitterly sorrowful,
The traveler's longing is drawn out and long.
Thinking of you, ten thousand li away,
Alone, I paint the secluded fragrance (幽芳).<35>

**Summary**

This article presents a collection of poems centered around the theme of orchids (蘭花), written by Kim Okyŏn (金吾然) and his Chinese contemporary Zhou Maozhai (周茂齋). Kim's poems express deep sorrow, nostalgia for a separated person, pent-up frustration (鬱憤), and patriotic grief, using the orchid as a symbol of enduring integrity amidst difficult times (腥風血雨). He responds to Zhou's poems, which also use the orchid motif to explore themes of expressing emotions, longing for the homeland, and preferring inner purity (素心) over superficiality. The final short poem expresses longing for a distant friend, Mr. Yu (劉君). From a historical perspective, these poems are significant as they reflect the somber mood and suppressed nationalist sentiment among Korean intellectuals during the Japanese colonial period (1926). The exchange with a Chinese poet highlights the continued cultural connections and shared classical traditions across East Asia, even during times of political upheaval. The veiled references to suffering, hidden strength ("frosty blade... hidden deep in its scabbard"), and patriotic sorrow (楚臣心) would likely resonate with Korean readers facing colonial oppression, making the poems a subtle form of cultural resistance and expression of national identity.
