Spring
						Pak Sŭnghyu

It's spring, spring!
On the old fortress site, new sprouts bud
The river water melts and flows down, flows down

Above the water flowing past the fortress walls
The sound of the laundry bat
Resounds through, shakes the mountains and rivers

From deep in those mountains
The sound of the woodcutter's axe (樵夫의 독기소리)
Announces the news of spring,
The vigorous news of spring <91>

**Summary**

This short poem by Pak Sŭnghyu celebrates the arrival of spring. It uses simple, evocative imagery: budding sprouts on old fortress ruins, melting river water, and the sounds of human activity returning with the warmer weather – the rhythmic beat of laundry bats and the distant chop of a woodcutter's axe. The poem conveys a sense of renewal and vibrant energy returning to the landscape. From a historical perspective, the poem offers a glimpse into the sensory experiences of spring in rural or semi-rural Korea during the colonial period. Its focus on natural cycles and simple labor provides a contrast to the political and social tensions of the era, potentially reflecting a desire for continuity or an appreciation of enduring natural rhythms amidst external pressures.

봄
						朴承烋
봄이다 봄!
성터에 새엄트고
江물은 녹아내리네 내리네

城밑을 스치는 물우에
빨내하는 방망이소리
山川을 울니네 뒤흔드네

저 山속에서
樵夫의 독기소리
봄소식을 전하네,
기운찬 봄소식을 ＜91＞
