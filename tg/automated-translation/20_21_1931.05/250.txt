Song of Colored Clothes
						Written by Ch'unwŏn

Take off the white clothes and let's go to the workplace
White clothes are the clothes of a ruined nation, the clothes of the idle

Let's keep our hearts white, but dye our clothes
People of Chosŏn, let's go to the workplace<75>

**Summary**

This short poem by Ch'unwŏn (Yi Kwangsu) exhorts Koreans ("People of Chosŏn") to abandon their traditional white clothing, labelling it as attire befitting idlers and a "ruined nation." Instead, it promotes wearing dyed (colored) clothing suitable for labor, urging people to go to the "workplace." While advocating for dyed clothes for practical work, it suggests maintaining inner purity ("keep our hearts white"). From a historical perspective, the poem is interesting as it reflects the push for modernization and industriousness during the Japanese colonial period. The critique of traditional white clothing, often seen as a symbol of Korean identity but also impractical for industrial labor, aligns with discourses that encouraged Koreans to adopt lifestyles deemed more modern and productive, sometimes echoing colonial assimilationist or modernization policies.
