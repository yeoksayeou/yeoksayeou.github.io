Throwing Crumbling Castle Stones
						Kim Pongje

Having snapped the old, fiery flute,
This body, which writhed,
Rubbing its aching heart against the castle stones for half a day,
Today too, picks up a castle stone and,
Straining both arms over the thickly
Frozen front river,
Throws it.

The thrown stone shatters into ten, twenty pieces—
Ah—the crumbled castle stones seem rotten after all!
But has your strength,
Which once blocked iron bullets of old,
Rotted away so much!

Again, again, picking up and throwing the crumbling castle stones,
Aha—with a clamorous sound,
From one flank of the blue-iced river,
Which lay coiled with its long waist bent,
Gush! Gush! Gush! The water surges,
Ah—like red blood—
Like red, red coagulated blood—

(1931, 2, To Mr. Noseong) <90>

**Summary**

The poem depicts a speaker's intense frustration and desperate action. After discarding a symbol of the past (the flute), the speaker interacts with decaying castle stones, representing perhaps a ruined heritage or weakened defense. The act of throwing these crumbling stones at a frozen river initially highlights their fragility. However, repeated throws eventually break the thick ice, causing water, described vividly as red blood, to gush forth. This powerful imagery suggests a violent release of pent-up energy or emotion, breaking through stagnation or oppression. For historians studying colonial Korea, the poem offers insight into the feelings of decay, impotence, and suppressed anger experienced under Japanese rule. The crumbling castle, the frozen river, and the final eruption of "blood" can be read as potent metaphors for the state of the nation and a yearning for a forceful awakening or liberation, even if destructive.

부슬리는 城돌을 던지며
						金鳳濟
옛 불든 피리를 꺽거버리고
한나절 城돌에 쓰린 가슴을 부벼대며
허덕이든 이 몸은
오날도 城돌을 뽑아 들고 두터이
얼은 앞 江에 양팔을 부르것고
던저 보나니
던지인 돌은 열조각 수무조각-
아-문허진 城돌은 그나마 썩엇나 보구나!
그러나 옛날의 쇠총알을 막든
네 힘이 그리 썩엇느냐!
다시 다시 부슬리는 城돌을 뽑아 던지니
아하- 요란한 소리와 함께
긴 허리를 굽실거리고 누엇든
푸른 어름의 江의 한 엽구리에서는
콸콸콸! 물결이 솟나니
아-붉은 피 같이-
붉은 붉은 선지피같이-
(1931, 2, 露星氏에게) ＜90＞
