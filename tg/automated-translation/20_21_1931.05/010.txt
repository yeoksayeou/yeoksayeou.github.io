Apology Notice

We had planned to publish two major articles in this month's issue, even having prepared the cover accordingly, but due to entirely unexpected and unavoidable circumstances, we were unable to publish the manuscripts in their entirety. We were thus left with no choice but to keep the cover as it was. For this, we offer our sincerest apologies one hundred times over to all our readers. Furthermore, we express our deepest regrets to those who provided us with their valuable manuscripts.

We had allocated space intending to begin the Tonggwang University lectures starting this month, but this unfortunately fell through. We ask all our readers across the land to deeply understand our situation and await the next issue.

**Summary**

This is an apology notice from the editors of *Tonggwang* magazine to its readers and contributors. They explain that due to unforeseen and unavoidable circumstances, two major planned articles could not be published, despite the cover already being prepared. They also mention that planned "Tonggwang University" lectures, intended to start that month, had to be cancelled. The editors ask for the readers' understanding and patience for the next issue. From a historical perspective, this notice is interesting as it highlights the difficulties faced by publishers during the colonial period. The vague mention of "unavoidable circumstances" could hint at external pressures or censorship, common issues at the time. The cancellation of the "Tonggwang University" lectures also suggests disruptions to educational or public discourse initiatives potentially associated with the magazine.
