Spring Night, A Moment of Spring Night is Worth a Thousand Gold Pieces
						Yi Ŭng-su

A spring night when the sound of Pungmangjae's flute passes through the smoke from the chimney hood (북덕),
Beneath the chimney, the cat, unable to overcome its spring passion, cries frequently, annoyingly (질사륵).
The snow-white arms of a young widow (靑霜寡婦) embrace the empty quilt as if to tear it,
A virgin's grape-like breasts (乳房) tremble violently—
Oh, spring night, spring night, why are you so long?

Early evening smoke creeps into the courtyard, and after dark, rain begins to fall.
But it did not tickle both cheeks, did not dampen the collar. <91>
Would I have known it was coming?
Would I have known this jewel-like rain was coming?
Already, it slips down the soy sauce crocks in the yard, beneath the light from the back window,
And wets the dimly dozing streetlights
In the dust-settled capital of a hundred households (百戶長安?), <92>

**Summary**

This poem by Yi Ŭng-su evokes the atmosphere of a rainy spring night, blending natural imagery with themes of human loneliness and longing. It contrasts the quiet sounds of the night – distant flute music, a cat's cry, falling rain – with the inner turmoil of a lonely widow and a young virgin, emphasizing the precious yet melancholic passage of time on such a night. The poem concludes with the rain subtly enveloping the sleeping city. From a historical perspective, the poem offers insight into the expression of personal sensuality and melancholy in Korean literature during the colonial period. Its publication suggests a literary space where such themes could be explored, contrasting intimate human feelings with the broader, perhaps indifferent, backdrop of nature and the implied city ("Paekho Changan"). The use of older Korean orthography and vocabulary is also of linguistic interest to historians.

						李應洙
北邙재 피리소리가 북덕 불연기를 새여가는 봄밤
굴둑밑에 봄정(情)을 못이겨하는 고양이의 울음잦아 질사륵
靑霜寡婦의 白雪같은 두 팔이 빈 이불을 찌여지라 끼여안고
處女의 포도알같은 乳房이 호도도 경련을 일으키는
오-봄밤 봄밤은 웨 이다지도 해낙은하고?

초저녁 煙氣가 뜰안을 기드니 어두어선 비가 내리네
그러나 두낯을 간즈리지 안코 옷깃을 축이지 안엇던 ＜91＞
오는 줄이나 아럿으랴
이 구슬같은 비가 오는 줄이나 알엇으랴
어느새 울안의 장독에 뒷창불 밑을 미끄러 띠리고
몬지 잠재운 百戶長安? 에
어렴풋이 조은는 등불을 적시도다 ＜92＞
