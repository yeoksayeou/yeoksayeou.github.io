Spring has come,
Warm spring has come, they say.
The snow and ice melt and flow away.
Breaking through the painful, harsh spring of winter,
Seeking the quiet spring stream—
Flowing, flowing away.

Again, spring has come, they say.
The gentle spring breeze
Shakes the whole world.
On the spring grass, new sprouts shoot up,
And the beautiful flowers
Are all about to bloom, about to bloom.

Oh! Spring has come, they say.
Even within this heart that faced the cold frost,
A single blossom of spring has come.
This sorrowful heart, too, washes away tears,
It stirs, it surges up. <91>

**Summary**

This poem by Mok Ilsin celebrates the arrival of spring after a harsh winter. It describes the physical signs of spring – melting snow, gentle breezes, new sprouts, and blooming flowers – and connects this natural renewal to an emotional renewal within the speaker's heart, which had endured hardship ("cold frost," "sorrowful heart"). The poem ends on a note of stirring hope and surging vitality. For historians, the poem, written during the Japanese colonial period, might reflect a subtle expression of resilience and yearning for a brighter future, using the universal symbol of spring's return to convey personal and perhaps collective hope overcoming adversity. The specific language used, like "painful, harsh spring of winter," and the transition from sorrow to surging movement could be interpreted in this context.

봄이 왓다고
						睦一信
봄이 왓다고
따뜻한 봄이 왓다고
눈어름은 녹아서 흐르네
쓰리고 매운 겨울의 봄을 깨치며
고요한 봄시내를 차저-
흐르네 흐르네

또다시 봄이 왓다고
부드러운 봄바람은
왼 누리를 흔드네
봄 잔디엔 새싹이 솟아 나오고
아리따운 꽃들은
모다 피려네 피려네

오! 봄이 왓다고
찬 서리맞엇든 이 가슴속에도
한떨기의 봄이 왓다고
애답든 이 마음도 눈물씨스며
움지기네 용소슴치네 ＜91＞
