You and I
						Yu Kŭnsŏk

You and I are sunflowers,
A pair of companions blooming on the field hill.
Let us gaze upon that sun
And live on strongly.

You and I are sunflowers,
A pair of companions blooming on the field hill.
Let us become the farmers' tilling the fields'
Faithful guards (忠實한 護衛兵).

You and I are sunflowers,
A pair of companions blooming on the field hill.
In this coarse field,
Let us try sounding the trumpets of the march (行進).
-From an old manuscript ('30)- <90>

**Summary**

This poem, "You and I" by Yu Kŭnsŏk, uses the metaphor of two sunflowers growing together on a hill. It calls for solidarity, strength drawn from facing the sun (symbolizing hope or perhaps a higher ideal), a commitment to protecting the farmers who work the land, and the courage to advance ("march") even in difficult ("coarse") circumstances. The poem emphasizes resilience, companionship, and active participation in shaping the environment. From a historical perspective, the poem, written during the Japanese colonial period, could be interpreted through a nationalist lens. The "you and I" represent the Korean people, the sunflowers symbolize resilience and hope under hardship, the farmers represent the backbone of the nation, and the call to "march" suggests a desire for progress or liberation, albeit expressed metaphorically rather than overtly politically. The agrarian imagery and the theme of collective strength would resonate with contemporary ideals.

당신과 나
						柳根錫
당신과 나는 해바래기꽃
들 언덕에 핀 한쌍의 동무이오니
저 해를 바라보며
힘잇게 살아갑시다.

당신과 나는 해바래기꽃
들 언덕에 핀 한 쌍의 동무이오니
밭가는 農夫들의
忠實한 護衛兵이 됩시다.

당신과 나는 해바래기꽃
들 언덕에 핀 한쌍의 동무이오니
거츠른 이 들에
行進의 나팔을 불어 봅시다.
