Correction/Editing of New Poetry

For all of you diligently striving in New Poetry (新詩), it is a delightful thing that there is remarkable progress among those receiving instruction from the poet Ansŏ (岸曙), Mr. Kim Ŏk (金億).

**Summary**

This article announces a poetry critique service offered by the prominent poet Kim Ŏk through *Tonggwang* magazine in 1932. It encourages aspiring poets, particularly those working in the "New Poetry" style, to submit their work for personalized feedback and correction. The announcement details the submission process, including the address, the requirement of return postage, and a fee structure (30 *chŏn* per 50 lines, payable even by stamp) to manage volume. It also incentivizes participation by promising publication in *Tonggwang* for outstanding submissions. From a historical perspective, this notice is interesting as it highlights the active cultivation of modern Korean literature (specifically *Sinsi*) during the colonial period, with established figures like Kim Ŏk mentoring new writers via popular magazines. It also provides concrete details about the practicalities and economics (submission fees, postage) involved in literary mentorship and publication at the time.
