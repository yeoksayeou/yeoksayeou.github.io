**Summary**

This cartoon feature by Yu Wan-hŭi, titled "Various Aspects of Literary Figures," presents caricatures of contemporary Korean writers Cho Myŏng-hŭi and Yi Sang-hwa, ostensibly captured during a literary meeting. The piece offers a glimpse into the visual representation and public perception of key literary personalities during the colonial period. For historians, the cartoon serves as a visual artifact reflecting the cultural scene of the 1930s, including the interactions and perhaps the perceived characteristics of prominent intellectuals, as well as the early adoption of English loanwords like "snapshot" (스냎).
