At the Zoo
						Yohan

Fire-eating Bird
Its wings' feathers are short, so it cannot fly,
Its neck droops low, so its voice may not be fine,
But it has swallowed fire in its breast; is this a grand aspiration?

Crane 1
By the East Sea shore, in the evening glow,
It longs to let out a great cry,
In the vast blue of ninety thousand *ri*,
It sheds its vitality,
With no one to know its painted heart, it yearns the more.

Crane 2
*Kkeowi-kkeowi tturŭm-tturŭm*, all sorts of birds are calling,
But the lone crane upon the pine, why is it wordless?
A body trapped in a net—what use is crying?<56>

**Summary**

This work consists of three short poems depicting animals observed in a zoo: a "fire-eating bird" and two cranes. The poems contrast the animals' inner states or potential with their physical limitations or confinement. The fire-eating bird, unable to fly or sing beautifully, holds "fire" within. The first crane expresses immense longing and sheds its vitality against the backdrop of the vast sea and sky. The second crane remains silent amidst the noise of other birds because it is trapped in a net, rendering cries useless. From a historical perspective, these poems, written during the Japanese colonial period, can be interpreted allegorically. The confined, silent, or suffering animals, particularly the noble crane (a symbol of longevity and integrity in Korean culture), likely represent the constrained situation of the Korean people or nation under colonial rule, unable to express their aspirations ("grand aspiration," "great cry") or act freely ("cannot fly," "trapped in a net"). The silent suffering contrasts with inner turmoil or potential ("fire," "longing").
