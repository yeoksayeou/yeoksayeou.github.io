Publisher's Notice

As this magazine is still published according to the Publication Law (出版法), the scope of articles is restricted by said law to the four categories of academics (學術), arts/crafts (技藝), statistics (統計), and advertisements (廣告). Therefore, items outside this scope, such as current affairs (時事) and political commentary (政論), cannot be included. We ask for the understanding of our esteemed readers and contributors.

**Summary**

This publisher's notice from the magazine *Tonggwang* informs readers and contributors that due to restrictions imposed by the Publication Law (出版法), the magazine's content is limited to academics, arts/crafts, statistics, and advertisements. Consequently, articles on current events or political commentary cannot be published. This notice clearly reflects the censorship environment in colonial Korea under Japanese rule, where publications faced legal constraints limiting their scope, particularly regarding politically sensitive topics. Historians would find this a direct example of the press controls implemented by the Government-General and how publishers communicated these limitations to their audience.
