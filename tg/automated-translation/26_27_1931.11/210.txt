Bullfighting
						Nŭlsaem

Human cruelty knows no bounds,
How can they make gentle beasts fight?
Laughing heartily even as horns break upon impact.

When it was gentle and kind, one couldn't know its strength;
But when horn clashes against horn like lightning,
Even Mount T'aesan (泰山) beneath its feet would offer no obstacle.

Though patient for long, when anger flares, it's quite different;
As its hide is torn and horns are broken,
Its bucking and leaping become impossible to control.

I ask you, Humans! Be ashamed even before the cow.
Seemingly slow yet diligent, seemingly gentle yet courageous,
When its spirit rises, it knows no fear of death.

-At Masan Central Ground- <102>

**Summary**

This poem, "Bullfighting," is a critique of human cruelty as observed during a bullfight event at Masan Central Ground. The author contrasts the forced violence instigated by humans with the bull's inherent gentle nature, which hides immense strength and courage when provoked. The poem expresses admiration for the bull's endurance and spirit, urging humans to feel shame when comparing their actions to the bull's dignity even in suffering. From a colonial history perspective, the poem's focus on the endurance of a gentle creature forced into conflict, and its latent power when pushed too far, could be interpreted as an allegorical reflection on the Korean spirit under oppression, suggesting hidden resilience and the potential for fierce resistance despite outward appearances of submission or slowness.

鬪牛
						늘샘
인간의 잔악성은 아을길도 바업서라
어진 저 즘생을 싸홈이란 되단말가
마주처 뿔이 빠저도 하야하야 웃다니

순하고 어질적엔 그리 센줄 모를러니
이 뿔 저 뿔이 베락인 듯 마주칠 때
泰山도 발밑에 들면 거칠턱이 없을네

참을때 참다가도 성날때란 그러찬어
가죽이 메여지고 뿔이 또한 빠지도록
버티고 날뛰는 품은 것잡을 길 없어라

뭇노니 人間들아 소보기도 부끌어라
느린듯 부즈런하고 순한듯이 용맹잇어
기세를 도들때이란 죽을줄을 몰라라
