女性의 進出 (Advance of Women)

According to a survey report on women public officials after women's suffrage (婦人參政權) passed in the United States, two women have been elected and taken office as state governors (州知事), and thirteen women have been elected as members of the House of Representatives (衆議院 議員) to date, six of whom are currently serving (現職).

Statistically, 146 women have been chosen as members of state legislatures (州議會). There are currently eight female mayors (市長) in the United States of America (北米合衆國).<80>

**Summary**

This short news piece reports on the increasing number of women holding public office in the United States following the achievement of women's suffrage. It provides specific statistics for female state governors, members of the US House of Representatives (both total elected and currently serving), state legislators, and mayors as of late 1931. For historians, this article highlights Korean awareness of and interest in women's political progress in the West during the colonial period. It reflects the global discourse on women's rights and political participation reaching even colonized nations, potentially serving as a subtle comparison or source of inspiration regarding women's roles in society.
