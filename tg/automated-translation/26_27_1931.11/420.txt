4. The Text of Hunminjŏngŭm

It is difficult to know when the study of the Correct Sounds (正音, Jŏngŭm) began, but as mentioned before, it was completed in the 12th month of the year Kyeyu (癸亥), the 25th year [of King Sejong's reign] (1443 AD). It was then sent down to the Vernacular Script Office (諺文廳, Ŏnmun ch'ŏng) for three years, where it underwent discussion, experimentation, and interpretation by various renowned scholars of the time. It was promulgated when it was deemed "sufficiently complete." That is, in the 9th month of the year Pyŏngin (丙寅), the 28th year of King Sejong (1446 AD), Hunminjŏngŭm was promulgated to the world and implemented for the entire nation. The Annals of King Sejong (世宗實錄, Sejong Sillok), under the entry for the 9th month, Autumn, of the 28th year, records the following:

"This month, the Correct Sounds for the Instruction of the People (訓民正音, Hunminjŏngŭm) was completed. The royal preface states: The sounds of our country's language are different from those of China (中國, Chungguk) and are not mutually intelligible with Chinese script. Therefore, among the ignorant populace, there have been many who, having something they wish to say, have ultimately been unable to express their feelings. I, feeling pity for this, have newly created twenty-eight letters, wishing to enable everyone to learn them easily and use them conveniently for daily life.
ㄱ Guttural sound (牙音), like the initial sound of the character 君 (kun). Written doubled, like the initial sound of the character 蚪 (kyu).
ㅋ Guttural sound, like the initial sound of the character 快 (k'wae).
 Guttural sound, like the initial sound of the character 業 (ŏp).
ㄷ Lingual sound (舌音), like the initial sound of the character 斗 (tu). Written doubled, like the initial sound of the character 覃 (tam).
ㅌ Lingual sound, like the initial sound of the character 呑 (t'an).
ㄴ Lingual sound, like the initial sound of the character 那 (na).
ㅂ Labial sound (脣音), like the initial sound of the character * [Asterisk in original, likely 彆 (pyŏl)]. Written doubled, like the initial sound of the character 步 (po).
ㅍ Labial sound, like the initial sound of the character 漂 (p'yo).
ㅁ Labial sound, like the initial sound of the character 彌 (mi).
ㅈ Dental sound (齒音), like the initial sound of the character 卽 (chŭk). Written doubled, like the initial sound of the character 慈 (cha).
ㅊ Dental sound, like the initial sound of the character 侵 (ch'im).
ㅅ Dental sound, like the initial sound of the character 戌 (sul). Written doubled, like the initial sound of the character 邪 (sa).
ᅙ Glottal sound (喉音), like the initial sound of the character 挹 (ŭp).
ㅎ Glottal sound, like the initial sound of the character 虛 (hŏ). Written doubled, like the initial sound of the character 洪 (hong).
ㅇ Glottal sound, like the initial sound of the character 欲 (yok).
ㄹ Semi-lingual sound (半舌音), like the initial sound of the character 閭 (ryŏ).
 Semi-dental sound (半齒音), like the initial sound of the character * [Asterisk in original, likely 穰 (yang)].
 Like the medial sound (中聲) of the character 呑 (t'an).
ㅡ Like the medial sound of the character 卽 (chŭk).
ㅣ Like the medial sound of the character 侵 (ch'im).
ㅗ Like the medial sound of the character 洪 (hong).
ㅏ Like the medial sound of the character 覃 (tam).
ㅜ Like the medial sound of the character 君 (kun).
ㅓ Like the medial sound of the character 業 (ŏp).
ㅛ Like the medial sound of the character 欲 (yok).
ㅑ Like the medial sound of the character * [Asterisk in original, likely 穰 (yang)].
ㅠ Like the medial sound of the character 戌 (sul).
ㅕ Like the medial sound of the character * [Asterisk in original, likely 彆 (pyŏl)].
Final sounds (終聲) reuse the initial sounds (初聲). If ㅇ [Original uses ㆁ (옛이응) represented as ] is written consecutively below a labial sound, it becomes a light labial sound (脣輕音). If initial sounds are used together, they are written side by side (並書). The same applies to final sounds. , ㅡ, ㅗ, ㅜ, ㅛ, ㅠ are attached below the initial sound. ㅣ, ㅓ, ㅏ, ㅑ, ㅕ are attached to the right. All characters must be combined to form a sound. Adding one dot to the left indicates the departing tone (去聲); two dots indicate the rising tone (上聲); no dots indicate the level tone (平聲). The entering tone (入聲) uses the same dot system but is abrupt and fast (促急)."

Furthermore, immediately following this, the preface by Chŏng Inji (鄭麟趾), the Minister of Rites (禮曹判書), is published.

"Where there are the natural sounds of Heaven and Earth, there must naturally be the writing corresponding to them. Therefore, the ancients created writing based on sounds to communicate the feelings of all things and carry the Way of the Three Powers (Heaven, Earth, Man), and later generations could not change this. However, as the customs and lands of the four directions differ, the breath of sounds also varies accordingly. Generally, the languages of foreign countries have sounds that exist [in Chinese] and sounds that do not. Borrowing Chinese characters to communicate their usage is like fitting a handle * [Asterisk in original] to a hoe; how can it be achieved without * [Asterisk in original]? It is essential that names follow local conventions and find ease <81>, and they cannot be forced into uniformity. Our East (吾東方, O Tongbang) [*樂文物 - Asterisk in original] rites and artifacts emulate those of China (華夏, Hwahsia), but our regional dialects and common speech are not the same. Those learning writing worry about the difficulty of understanding the meaning and purpose, and those administering justice suffer from the difficulty of communicating the intricate details. In the past, Sŏl Ch'ŏng (薛聽) of Silla (新羅) first created Idu (吏讀), which is still used today in government offices and among the common people. However, these are all borrowed characters, sometimes awkward, sometimes obstructive, not merely vulgar and unfounded, but also unable to convey even one ten-thousandth of the spoken language. In the winter of Kyeyu (癸亥), His Majesty (我殿下, A Chŏnha) created the twenty-eight letters of the Correct Sounds, briefly presented examples and meanings, and named it Hunminjŏngŭm (訓民正音). The letter shapes imitate ancient seal script (古篆) [Original says 古豪, likely a typo for 古篆], and the sounds harmonize according to pronunciation. The principles of the Seven Modes (七調) and Three Ultimates (三極), the subtleties of the two vital energies (二氣), are all encompassed. With these twenty-eight letters, transformations are endless. They are simple yet essential, precise yet versatile. Therefore, the wise can understand them before the morning is over, and the ignorant can learn them within ten days. Using this to interpret books, one can know their meaning; using this in hearing legal cases, one can grasp the true situation. In character rhymes, the clear and muddy sounds can be distinguished; in music and song, the pitches (律呂) can be harmonized. There is no use for which it is not prepared, no place it cannot reach. Even the sound of the wind, the cry of cranes, the crowing of chickens, and the barking of dogs can all be written. His Majesty commanded us, your subjects, to add explanations and interpretations to instruct everyone, hoping that observers may understand on their own without a teacher. As for the profound origins and subtle meanings, they are beyond what we subjects can elaborate upon. Respectfully reflecting, His Majesty, with his heaven-sent sagacity, established systems and implemented measures surpassing the hundred kings. The creation of the Correct Sounds, derived from nature without relying on any prior models, is surely because its ultimate principles are omnipresent and not the product of human artifice. Truly, our Eastern country has existed for no short time, yet the great wisdom to develop things and complete tasks has awaited this day. Ode."

Additionally, there is the "Hunminjŏngŭm Ŏnhae" (訓훈民민正졍音), which seems to have been promulgated as a standalone book written entirely in Hunminjŏngŭm. Its full text is as follows:
(Notes 10 & 29)

Hunminjŏngŭm (訓훈民민正졍音)"

This [the text presented above] is based on the Hangul Sa edition, which compared three versions: the standalone woodblock print owned by Mr. Pak Sŭngbin (朴勝彬); the woodblock version included at the beginning of *Wŏrin Ch'ŏn'gangjigok* (月印千江之曲) owned by the Kwangmunhoe (光文會); and a manuscript copy of the version held by the Japanese Imperial Household Ministry (日本 宮內省), owned by Mr. Ŏ Yunjŏk (魚允迪). As a result of the comparison, the versions owned by Mr. Pak and Mr. Ŏ were entirely identical, and the Kwangmunhoe version was also identical to those two except for the first and second leaves. Therefore, a photographic reproduction was made by combining the first and second leaves of the Kwangmunhoe version (from which the four characters "世宗御製" - Sejong Ojye, 'Made by King Sejong' - in the first line were carved out) and the third leaf onwards from Mr. Pak's version. (Note 3)

Besides this, many records and praises regarding the creation of Hunminjŏngŭm can be seen in literature. Let me introduce a few examples. The *Yongje Ch'onghwa* (慵齋叢話) states:
"King Sejong established the Vernacular Script Office (諺文廳), ordering Sin Koryŏng (申高靈) [Possibly Sin Sukchu of Koryŏng], Sŏng Sammun (成三問), etc., to create the vernacular script (諺文). There were eight initial and final sounds, eight initial sounds [Note: repetition/discrepancy in the quote], and twelve medial sounds. The form of the letters was based on Sanskrit characters. It could universally record the sounds and scripts of our country and various other countries which could not be written before, without fatigue [? perhaps 無礙 'without hindrance']." (Note 25)

The *Tonggak Chapki* (東閣雜記) states:
"Twenty-eight letters were created by the King (御製), named Vernacular Script (諺文). An office was established within the palace (禁中), and Sin Sukchu (申叔舟), Sŏng Sammun (成三問), Ch'oe Hang (崔恒), etc., were ordered to determine them, named Hunminjŏngŭm (訓民正音)." (Note 30)

The *Akko* (樂考, Section on Music) in the *Tongguk Munhŏn Pigo* (東國文獻備考) states:
"In the 28th year of King Sejong of our dynasty (本朝), Hunminjŏngŭm was created by the King (御製). His Majesty believed that while various countries each created scripts to record their national dialects, our country uniquely lacked one. Thus, he created 28 mother and son letters, named Vernacular Script (諺文). An office was opened in the palace (禁中), and Chŏng Inji (鄭麟趾), Sin Sukchu (申叔舟), Sŏng Sammun (成三問), Ch'oe Hang (崔恒), etc., were ordered to compile and finalize it. It generally imitated ancient seal script (古篆), divided into initial, medial, and final sounds. Although the letters are simple, they are easy, their transformations are endless, and they can universally record all speech sounds that other scripts cannot, without hindrance. The Ming Dynasty (明朝) Hanlin Academy scholar (翰林學士) Hwang Ch'an (黃瓚), who was exiled to Liaodong (遼東) at the time, was consulted; Sŏng Sammun and others were ordered to meet Hwang Ch'an to inquire about phonology, traveling back and forth to Liaodong a total of thirteen times." (Note 27)

The *Saga Chip* (四佳集) states:
"At that time, His Majesty first created the Vernacular Script (諺文). The various scholars of the Hall of Worthies (集賢殿) jointly submitted memorials arguing against it, and there were even those who submitted strongly worded remonstrances. His Majesty ordered Ch'oe Hang (崔恒) and others to compose the Hunminjŏngŭm." (Note 31)

The preface to the *Kyŏngse Undosŏl* (經世韻圖說序) states:
"Our King Sejong the Great (世宗大王) created the twenty-eight letters of Hunminjŏngŭm, corresponding to the number of the constellations. The shapes of the letters resemble the round and curved forms of the constellations Kui and Bi (奎璧); the dots and strokes follow the style of lesser seal (小篆) and clerical (分隷) scripts. They are clear, simple, and easy, enabling even children and women to know them. Expanding upon them is sufficient to express all the writings under Heaven." (Note 28)

The *Sŏngho Sasŏl* (星湖辭說) states:
"Our Eastern vernacular characters (諺字) were created in the year Pyŏngin (丙寅) during the reign of King Sejong. For everything that has a sound, there is no corresponding character lacking. People say nothing like it has existed since Cang* [Cangjie - 蒼頡, asterisk in original]." (Note 26)

The *Chibong Yusŏl* (芝峰類說) states:
"The style of our country's Vernacular Script (諺書) completely imitates Sanskrit characters. It began in the reign of King Sejong; an office was established, and it was compiled, but the ingenuity of the letter creation is said to have truly come from His Majesty's sagacious mind (睿算). Indeed, with the advent of the Vernacular Script, there are no speech sounds from any direction that cannot be communicated. This is what is called something impossible for anyone but a sage." (Note 32)

**Summary**

This article excerpt details the creation and promulgation of the Korean script, Hunminjŏngŭm, by King Sejong. It quotes the King's preface from the *Annals of King Sejong*, explaining the motivation (linguistic difference from Chinese, inability of commoners to express themselves) and listing the 28 letters with examples. It also includes Chŏng Inji's detailed preface praising the script's natural basis, systematic design, ease of learning, and superiority over borrowing Chinese characters (Idu). The article presents the full text of the *Hunminjŏngŭm Ŏnhae*, the vernacular explanation of the script, and cites various historical documents (*Yongje Ch'onghwa*, *Tonggak Chapki*, *Tongguk Munhŏn Pigo*, etc.) that describe the creation process, the scholars involved (Sin Sukchu, Sŏng Sammun, Ch'oe Hang, etc.), the script's features (based on sound, shape, ancient/Sanskrit scripts), and the consultations with Chinese scholar Hwang Ch'an.

From a colonial history perspective, this 1931 article is significant for its focus on the unique origin and scientific nature of the Korean script, implicitly asserting Korean cultural identity and intellectual achievement separate from both China and Japan. By meticulously presenting primary sources like the *Sillok*, Chŏng Inji's preface, and the *Ŏnhae*, the author reinforces the historical legitimacy and sophistication of the Korean language and writing system during a period when Korean culture was suppressed under Japanese rule. The emphasis on the script's ability to represent *Korean* sounds distinct from Chinese ("國之語音, 異乎中國") and its ease of learning for the common people ("愚民," "人人易習") resonates with nationalist sentiments promoting literacy and cultural preservation.

4. 訓民正音의 本文
正音의 연구는 언제붙어 시작되엇는지 알기 어렵지마는 이미 말함같이 25년 癸亥(서기 1443) 12월에 끝난 것을 다시 3년간 諺文廳에 나리어 거기서 당시 高名한 여러 학자들의 토의와 실험과  해석을 거치어 「그만하면 완전하다」고 생각되는 때에 發布하게 된 것이외다. 즉 世宗 28년 丙寅(서기 1446) 9월에 訓民正音은 세상에 發布되어 전 국민에게 시행하게 된 것이외다. 世宗實錄 28년 秋 9월 條에 다음과 같이 기록되엇읍니다.
「是月, 訓民正音成, 御製曰, 國之語音, 異乎中國, 與文學不相流通, 故愚民有所欲言, 而終不得伸其情者多矣, 予, 爲此憫然, 新制二十八字, 欲使人人易習便於日用耳.

또 그 아래로 잇대어 禮曹判書 鄭麟趾의 이에 대한 序文이 揭載되어 잇읍니다.
「有天地自然之聲則必有天地自然之文, 所以古人因聲判, 以通萬物之情, 以載三才之道, 而後世不能易也, 然四方風土區別, 聲氣亦隨而異焉, 盖外國之語有其聲無其聲, 假中國之字以通其用, 是猶柄*之鉏鋙也, 豈能達而無*乎, 要皆名隨所處而安＜81＞, 不可强之使同也, 吾東方*樂文物侔擬華夏, 但方言俚語不與之同, 學書者患其旨趣之難曉, 治獄者病其曲折之難通, 昔新羅薛聽始作吏讀, 官府民間至今行之, 然皆假字而用, 或澁或窒, 非但鄙陃無稽而己, 至於言語之間則不能達其萬一焉, 癸亥冬我殿下創判正音二十八字, 略揭例義以示之, 名曰訓民正音, 象形而字倣古豪, 因聲而音叶, 七調三極之義, 二氣之妙, 莫不該括以二十八字而轉換無窮, 簡而要, 精而通, 故智者不崇朝而會, 愚者可浹旬而學, 以是解書, 可以知其義, 以是聽訟, 可以得其情, 字韻則淸濁之能辨, 樂歌則律呂之克諧, 無所用而不備, 無所往加不達, 雖風聲鶴淚鷄鳴狗吠, 皆可得而書焉, 途命臣等評加解釋, 以喩諸人, 庶使觀者, 不師而自悟, 若其淵源義精之妙則非巨等之所能發揮也, 恭撿我殿下, 以天縱之聖, 制度施爲超越百王, 正音之作, 無所祖述而成於自然, 豈以其至理之無所不在而非人爲之私也, 夫東方有國, 不爲不久而開物成務之大智, 盖有待於今日也歌.」

이 것은 한글 社版에 의한 것인데 이는 그 社에서 單本刻版인 朴勝彬씨 藏本과 月印千江之曲의 卷首에 編入된 木刻板인 光文會藏本과 日本 宮內省 藏本의 抄本인 魚允迪씨 藏本의 3종을 비교한 결과, 朴, 魚 兩氏의 藏本은 전연 동일하고 또 光文會 本도 제 1 제 2葉의 외에는 그 兩本과 동일하엿는 고로 제 1행의 「世宗御製」의 4字를 깎아 버린 光文會본의 제 1, 2葉과 제 3葉 이하의 朴씨 本을 합하여 사진판으로 한 것이외다. (註 3)
