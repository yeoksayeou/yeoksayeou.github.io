Poet of the Epic Period
						Lee Eung-soo

He was already no longer the youth of the Romantic Period (浪漫期)
He was a human who sat upon the corpse (死骸) of youth
Staring at the stark, blue laughter of reality

His life was tasteless and dry like chewing wax (蠟)
Cold like a withered tree (枯木) on a desolate mountain (寒山)

He no longer knew how to find the secret of youth
And the world within the tomb from the sound of the Pukmangsan (北邙山) flute heard on a hazy spring evening
Nor could he hear the flowing melody of life (人生)
In the song of fallen leaves rolling across the autumn fields

If you call him a poet, he was already not a lyric poet (舒情詩人)
He was already a cold, epic poet (舒事詩人)<102>

**Summary**

This poem by Lee Eung-soo contrasts a new type of poet, the "Poet of the Epic Period," with the outdated "Romantic" poet. This figure is characterized by disillusionment, having moved past youthful sentimentality to confront a harsh, cold reality, described as sitting on the "corpse of youth." Life is perceived as tasteless and bleak, and traditional poetic inspirations like nature's beauty (spring evenings, autumn leaves) no longer resonate. This poet is defined not by emotion (lyricism) but by a cold observation of life, becoming an "epic" or narrative poet focused on reality. From a historical perspective, the poem reflects a potential shift in Korean literary trends during the colonial period, possibly moving away from romanticism towards realism or reflecting the bleak socio-political atmosphere. Historians might find it indicative of changing artistic sensibilities and attitudes towards life and art under Japanese rule.

舒事期의 詩人
						李應洙
그는 벌서 浪漫期의 靑春이 아니엇습니다
그는 靑春이란 死骸를 깔고 앉어
현실의 새파란 웃음을 응시하는 인간이엇습니다

그의 생활은 무미간조하기 蠟을 씹는 것 같고
싸늘하기가 寒山의 枯木 같습니다

그는 벌서 흐린 봄 저녁 들려오는 北邙山 피리소리에서
靑春의 秘密과 무덤안의 세계를 찾을 줄 몰랏고
가을 들판을 굴러가는 落葉의 노래에서
人生의 유수한 멜로디를 듣지 못합니다

그를 詩人이라면 그는 벌서 舒情詩人은 아니엇습니다
그는 벌서 싸늘한 舒事詩人이엇습니다＜102＞
