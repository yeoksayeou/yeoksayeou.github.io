Mountains and Rivers at Year's End
						Cho Chong-hyŏn

I had hoped this year would be rewarding,
But tomorrow is the last day of the year, and it passes just like that again.
Our land of three thousand *li*, how very distant it seems.

Though I've achieved nothing, my age increases by one year again.
Even if I haven't found comrades, my resolve strengthens.
Having lived another year, I understand Chosŏn even more.

Can we say our strength is small? If gathered, it's hundreds strong.
Why are our wills and minds so divided? <96>
In weary, worn-out Hansŏng, only a handful of cold ashes remain.

Turning back, what should the eyes of the people of this land realize?
For what purpose do they possess hands, feet, and two ears?
Are they meant to be bound just as they are, alive, and buried? -1931, 12 -<97>

**Summary**

This poem by Cho Chong-hyŏn expresses deep disappointment and melancholy at the close of 1931. The poet reflects on the lack of tangible progress or achievement, both personally and for Korea ("Our land of three thousand *li*"), despite the passage of time and growing personal resolve. He laments the division among Koreans ("Why are our wills and minds so divided?") and paints a desolate picture of Hansŏng (Seoul). The poem ends with a sharp, almost despairing, rhetorical question criticizing the apathy and inaction of the people. For historians, the poem offers insight into the feelings of disillusionment, frustration with internal disunity, and critique of public passivity among some Korean intellectuals during the Japanese colonial period, juxtaposed with a persistent, though perhaps lonely, personal determination.

歲暮의 江山
						趙宗玄
올해는 어떨는가 보람큼직 하엿더니,
내일이 섯달그믐 또 그대로 넘어간다.
삼천리 우리네 강산 너무 아득하구나.

해논것 없건마는 나인 한살 또 불른다.
동지는 못 얻어도 립지서원 굳어진다.
한 해를 더 살고나니 조선 더욱 알러라.

힘이 적다할까 모으면은 백였´대이.
뜻과 마음이 어이하여 각가진고. ＜96＞
지치고 낡은 한성에 찬 재한줌 남도다.

도라봐 깨칠것이 이땅사람 눈이시리.
손발 두 귀는 무엇하자 지녓는고.
산차로 고대로 묶어 장사하고 마련가. -1931, 12 -＜97＞
