**Body Text Translation:**
Divorce Market, Reno City

News regarding Reno City, where anyone can get a divorce by staying for just six weeks. It has been half a year since the divorce law was implemented, and during that time, the number of divorce applications reached 3,234, with 3,217 granted. The highest number handled in one day was 189. Lawyers' income during this period was $482,550, averaging $150 per case. The court's income was $128,580. Furthermore, with gambling also openly conducted, the total income of the entire city is said to be one million dollars per week. <95>

**Summary**

This short news piece reports on the city of Reno, Nevada, which became famous for its lenient divorce laws allowing divorce after only a six-week residency. It notes the high volume of divorce cases (over 3,200 applications in six months), the significant income generated for lawyers and the courts, and the contribution of legalized gambling to the city's overall weekly revenue, estimated at one million dollars. For historians of colonial Korea, this article is interesting as it shows an awareness of and interest in specific social and legal developments in the United States, even seemingly niche ones like Reno's divorce industry. It reflects a globalizing perspective in Korean media, reporting on the economic aspects (lawyer fees, court income, gambling revenue) of a social phenomenon far removed from Korea, perhaps offering a contrast or curiosity piece for readers under Japanese rule.
