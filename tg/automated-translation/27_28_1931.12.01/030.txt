A Final Reckoning of 1931, The World Situation Over the Past Year
						Kim Chang-hwan

The Panic (恐慌), which attacked Wall Street in New York, the general headquarters of world financial capital, in the autumn of 1929, has subsequently expanded and worsened year after year. Despite the predictions of economic recovery from 1931 onwards by financial authorities, it is impossible to estimate when it will bottom out. As production rapidly contracts, the unemployed flood the streets, which in turn causes a sharp increase in the payment of unemployment insurance benefits (in Britain, France, etc.). National income has fallen sharply, leading to a drastic decrease in government tax revenue. However, it is not only impossible to drastically reduce expenditures in direct proportion, but it rather invites an increase in expenditures, resulting in a so-called "deficit (赤字)," meaning a budget shortfall, in the final accounts. (This is true not only for the imperialist powers like Britain, Japan, the US, France, Germany, Italy, etc., but also for colonies and semi-colonies.) Thus, the desperate calls for administrative, financial, and tax policy reorganization—such as reducing officials' salaries, cutting unemployment funds, and halting or postponing planned projects—and the adoption of austerity and savings policies by all countries are nothing more than desperate efforts to prevent financial collapse. This state of panic has influenced all domestic and international issues and has also provoked various incidents. Major domestic events include revolutions in South American countries and general elections in various nations, where the "economic national crisis" spurred public sentiment, leading to the decline of proletarian parties and the rise of right-wing forces. There are even tendencies towards dictatorial politics in Germany and Britain, showing a rightward shift in the global trend. Internationally, key events include the Austro-German Customs Union, Mr. Hoover's moratorium proposal, mutual visits by national leaders, the US tariff hike and retaliatory tariffs by other countries, and the issue of arms limitation aimed at saving expenses and reducing taxes. While various countries are gasping under the panic as described above, the one nation standing aloof is the socialist state, Worker-Peasant Russia. Its Five-Year Plan is steadily being implemented, and its dumping of wheat, etc., is troubling other countries already struggling with abundant harvests. Important issues unrelated to this panic include the Manchurian Incident (滿洲事變), the anti-British movement in India, and the Spanish Revolution. The central issues in foreign affairs for 1931 were the arms limitation problem, the one-year payment moratorium plan, and the Manchurian Incident. Here is an introduction to the major issues decisively related to the global situation. <2>

Arms Limitation Problem
As the London Naval Treaty came into effect on October 27, 1930, efforts toward disarmament shifted focus to the Disarmament Conference scheduled for February 1932. However, judging by the current situation, although various countries have conditionally accepted participation in the conference following the Italian Foreign Minister's proposal for a one-year arms holiday, the future prospects are viewed rather pessimistically. Furthermore, the Continental European naval issues involving Britain, France, and Italy, which were not resolved at the London Conference, were temporarily reported to have reached a compromise in February due to the efforts of British Foreign Secretary Henderson. However, with the difficulty in resolving the Franco-Italian parity issue and the French naval authorities' announcement of a naval construction plan six years prior [likely refers to a long-term plan], the situation has repeatedly become entangled, making it uncertain when a resolution will be reached.

Payment Moratorium Plan
German reparations were set by the Young Plan at an average annual payment of 1,025,400,000 yen, currently around the 800 million yen level. However, due to the global panic and the crash in commodity prices, Germany's burden effectively increased by about 30%. Consequently, the German Chancellor and Foreign Minister visited Britain to request relief measures and appealed to other powers as well. As a result, US President Hoover proposed a one-year postponement of reparations and war debt payments on June 20th. Prior to this, the US government had sent Treasury Secretary Mellon to Europe to investigate whether Germany's financial collapse was a cause of the world depression. It is said that Hoover's moratorium proposal was actually decided upon based on a single telegram from Treasury Secretary Mellon stating "Germany in peril." Messrs. Hoover and Mellon believed that this moratorium plan could prevent a revolution by the National Socialist Party (國粹社會黨), which had suddenly gained strength since the September 1930 general election by using the slogan of reparations cancellation, riding on Germany's depression, and could also secure America's claims against Germany. However, Germany's bankrupt state did not respond to such an injection (注射). Meanwhile, political instability in Germany damaged its foreign credit, leading to capital flight of about 900 million Marks over two months, plunging the German financial world into the abyss (奈落) of bankruptcy. Consequently, the seven reparations-related countries—Britain, the US, France, Italy, etc.—met in London in July and decided on three measures for rescuing the German financial sector. However, among financial experts and informed observers who knew this payment moratorium plan was merely a temporary camphor injection, the argument for canceling reparations and war debts is being forcefully advocated. During the visit of French Prime Minister Laval to the US in mid-October and his meeting with President Hoover, some kind of understanding was reportedly reached, with the European side expected to propose a further moratorium or reduction plan in the future.

Austro-German Customs Union Problem
The Austro-German Customs Union, announced on March 21st, aimed to abolish tariffs between the two countries, unify external tariff rates, and distribute the revenue appropriately. Its purpose was to rescue Austria (墺地利) from economic difficulties, find a large market for Austrian agricultural products in Germany, and open up a market for German industrial products in Austria. This issue provoked a major controversy in European diplomatic circles, with France asserting it was a prelude to an Austro-German merger (合倂) and demanding its abandonment. Ultimately, it was referred (附議) to the Permanent Court of International Justice, and a few days before Germany lost the case by a vote of five to four, it was voluntarily abandoned.

British General Election and the India Problem
The second Labour Party cabinet tendered its mass resignation (總辭職) on August 14th. The reason was a disagreement among cabinet ministers (閣僚) over the method to cover the expected 1.2 billion yen deficit in the budget for the fiscal year 1932 (next year), specifically regarding the 665 million yen saving on unemployment insurance benefits, which the trade unions opposed. Another theory suggests that major figures in the American banking world pressured the Bank of England, stating they would not grant credit to Britain unless substantial savings in unemployment insurance were realized. However, through the mediation (斡旋) of His Majesty King George V, Mr. MacDonald formed a non-partisan (超黨派的) national unity (擧國一致) cabinet with the Conservative and Liberal parties to overcome the economic national crisis. Consequently, the Labour Party suffered a major split, and the Liberal Party also became divided. As the national unity cabinet was a cross-party entity aimed at overcoming the national crisis, it dictatorially approved the deficit coverage and unemployment benefit savings without separate parliamentary approval. Seeking a mandate from the people, Parliament was dissolved in September, and the general election on October 27th resulted in an overwhelming victory for the government side and a crushing defeat (慘敗) for the opposition Labour Party. This, along with the German general election, the French presidential election, and the Japanese prefectural assembly elections (府懸議選擧), can be seen as part of a global trend towards dictatorial politics <3> and a rightward shift. Since the core force of the ruling coalition is the Conservative Party, it is clear that the current cabinet will adopt a protective tariff (保護關稅) policy to protect domestic industries (內地産業). It is expected to conclude preferential tariff (特惠關稅) agreements with dominions and colonies, leading to the emergence of a British economic imperialism. If this happens, the resistance movement in India and other exploited regions will likely become even fiercer. Faced with the fierce anti-British movement in India, Britain, struggling for countermeasures (對策), devised the British-Indian Round Table Conference (英印圓卓會議). Gathering minority factions excluding the National Congress party, they convened in London from mid-November last year to late January this year and drafted the second political reform proposal. However, substantially, there were significant reservations in the three major areas of international finance and foreign affairs, making it unlikely to satisfy the demands of the Gandhi faction, which advocated (標榜) independence. During the conference proceedings, the arrested Gandhi faction members were released, and an armistice agreement (休戰條約) was concluded between Gandhi and Viceroy Irwin, bringing the major unrest (騷擾) of 1930-31 to a temporary halt. Consequently, Gandhi was scheduled to attend the Second Round Table Conference, held in mid-September 1931, as the sole representative of the National Congress party to present his party's demands.
The Round Table Conference was held for some time but is currently suspended due to political changes in Britain, etc. India is Britain's lifeline. Mr. Gandhi, called a great sage (聖雄), is an extremely clever politician and must have participated with some calculation, but its success cannot but be doubted.

Soviet Five-Year Plan
While all capitalist countries are gasping under the depression, the one nation standing aloof is the socialist state, Worker-Peasant Russia. To achieve the goal of "catching up and surpassing the advanced capitalist countries" in all industrial sectors as quickly and skillfully as possible, the Five-Year Plan for National Economic Development came into being. This Five-Year Plan covers the period from 1929 to 1933 and encompasses a wide range of industrial sectors. The core elements of this plan are industrialization and the socialization of the agricultural economy. Having achieved unexpectedly good results in the first and second years, the third year, starting in October 1930, aims to bring more than half of all farm households into collectivized management (協同經營化) and to advance industrialization to match pre-war industrial production levels within this year alone.

Manchurian Incident
Among the weak nation movements in 1931, India's anti-British movement stands out. However, compared to the fierce struggle of the previous year, this year saw the anti-British movement enter a truce state due to the Gandhi-Irwin Pact and participation in the Second Round Table Conference. As for semi-colonial movements, China greeted the new year hopefully, implementing nationally determined tariff rates (國定稅率) from New Year's Day with high spirits (意氣軒昻). However, the abolition of consular jurisdiction (領事裁判權) and extraterritoriality (治外法權) amounted to mere declarations (聲明) or makeshift measures (便法公布) due to the rigid stance of powers like Britain, the US, France, and Japan, with success only achieved in negotiations with the Netherlands and Norway. Meanwhile, between Japan and China, incidents like the Wanbaoshan Incident (萬寶山事件) and the Korean Incident occurred. Before negotiations could even begin, the Nakamura Incident (中村大尉事件) took place, followed by the outbreak (勃發) of the Manchurian Incident (滿洲事變). This is the most significant international conflict of 1931. Although it was triggered by the bombing of the South Manchuria Railway (滿鐵爆破), it is a more appropriate observation (妥當한 觀察) that it exploded due to the accumulated dangerous sentiments arising from disputes over various pending issues (諸 懸案), starting with the South Manchuria Railway problem itself. It naturally caused a great shock (衝動) worldwide. The United States became involved, and the League of Nations is striving to resolve the issue. A resolution demanding Japan's troop withdrawal (撤兵) by November 16th, stating that the current incident and the resolution of various pending issues between Japan and China are separate matters, was submitted to the League Council meeting convened due to the Manchurian Incident. The result was a 13-to-1 vote, meaning only Japan opposed it. Although it failed to pass because effectiveness requires unanimity, it remains solemnly (儼然히) in the Council report, placing Japan in an unfavorable international position. It is unpredictable how the situation will unfold at the League Council meeting reconvening on November 16th, but the resolution of this incident is a crucial matter concerning the life and death (死活) of both Japan and China. Stimulated (刺戟) by this incident, the Nanjing-Guangzhou unification movement arose in China. However, recent developments suggest that optimism is not warranted. The reason the Nanjing-Guangzhou unification conference has lost its initial momentum compared to the beginning, while China faces a critical national crisis, is Chiang's cancellation of his resignation (下野). Behind this lies the fact that British Minister Lampson discouraged Chiang and Zhang [Xueliang] from resigning <4> and expressed support, aiming to secure British rights and interests (利權) in South and Central China. This British attitude was also manifested in the League of Nations Council, which will significantly impact Far Eastern relations.
In summary, the various facts described above indicate that the chronic depression, with no clear end in sight, has brought about the collapse (崩壞) of capitalism, raising numerous domestic and international problems. <5>

**Summary**

This 1931 article by Kim Chang-hwan provides a global overview from a Korean perspective during the Japanese colonial period. It highlights the severe impact of the Great Depression worldwide, leading to economic hardship, political instability (including revolutions and a rise in right-wing/dictatorial tendencies), and international tensions. Key events discussed include the failure of disarmament talks, the Hoover Moratorium on war debts/reparations, the aborted Austro-German Customs Union, Britain's political turmoil and the Indian independence movement (Gandhi's role), the progress of the Soviet Five-Year Plan amidst capitalist crisis, and centrally, the Manchurian Incident. The author sees the Depression as a systemic crisis of capitalism, causing widespread problems, and views the Manchurian Incident as a critical flashpoint with life-or-death implications for Japan and China, noting the complex international diplomacy surrounding it. From a Korean colonial history perspective, the article is interesting as it reflects a Korean intellectual analyzing global events under Japanese rule. While focusing on international affairs, the context of colonial subjugation implicitly underlies the discussion of imperialism, national movements (India), and international power dynamics (Manchuria Incident, involving Japan). The author's somewhat detached, analytical tone regarding major powers, including Japan, and the framing of global events, might be noteworthy for historians studying Korean intellectual thought and responses to global crises during this period.

一九三一年의 總決算, 過去 一年間의 世界大勢
						金章煥
1929年 秋 世界 金融資本의 總本營 紐育 월드街까지 掩襲한 恐慌은 其后 遂年 擴大 甚刻化하야 財政 權威者들의 1931年度부터의 景氣恢復 豫言에 不拘하고 그 底止할 바를 推斷치 못하게 하고 잇다. 生産이 急激히 縮少되는 結果 失業者는 街頭에 물밀듯 하야 이것은 또한 失業保險金의 支拂을 激增케 하며 (英佛 等) 國民所得이 急激이 低下하야 財政上의 歲入은 激減되엇으나 이와 正比例로 歲出을 激減할 수는 없을 뿐 아니라 도리어 歲出의 增加를 招來하야 決算面에 所謂 「赤字」 卽 豫算 缺損이 生하게 되엇다.(日英米佛獨伊 等 帝國主義 列强뿐아니라 植民地 半植民地까지 다.) 이리하야 官吏減俸, 失業基金減額, 豫定事業의 中止, 或은 繰延 等 行財稅政 整理를 絶呌하고 各國이 모다 緊縮節約政策을 採用하고 잇음은 財政의 破綻을 防止하려는 畢死的 努力에 不過할 것이다. 이 恐慌場은 國內 國際的임을 勿論하고 모든 問題에 影響하고 또한 모든 事件을 惹起하엿으니 國內的 大事實로는 南米 諸國의 革命과 各國의 總選擧에 「經濟國難」이 一般 民心을 促하야 無産派의 淍落, 右派의 行勢를 招來하야 獨英 兩國에는 獨裁政治 傾向까지 잇어 世界的 大勢는 右傾하고 國際的으로는 獨墺關稅同盟, 후버氏의 모라토리움 提案, 各國 首腦者의 相互 訪問, 米國의 關稅引上 및 各國의 關稅對抗, 又는 經費節約 租稅輕減을 爲한 軍備制限 問題 等이다. 右와 如히 各國이 恐慌으로 헐덕어리고 잇는 가운데 홀로 超然한 國家는 社會主義 國家 勞農露西亞로서 其 五條年計劃은 着着 實行되고 잇으며 小麥 等의 投賣로 가득이나 豊作으로 어쩔 줄 모르고 잇는 各國을 괴롭게 하고 잇다. 이 恐慌과 別 關係 없는 問題로 重要한 問題는 滿洲事變�, 印度反英運動, 西班牙革命 等인데 一九三一年 外交問題의 中心이 된 것은 軍備制限 問題 一個年 支拂猶豫案, 滿洲事變 等이다. 이제 世界的 大勢 決定的, 關係 잇는＜2＞ 重大 問題만 紹介하면 如左하다.

軍費制限 問題
倫敦 海軍條約이 1930年 10月 27日부터 效力이 發生하게 되엇슴으로 軍縮의 努力은 1932年 2月 開催될 軍縮會議에 쏠리게 되엇다. 그러나 지금 形勢로 보아서는 伊外相의 提唱한 一箇年休日案에 各國의 條件附 會議參加 受諾이 잇엇으나 그 前途는 자못 悲觀視 된다. 또 他方 倫敦會議에서 決定되지 아니 한 英佛伊의 大陸派 海軍問題는 二月 헨더손 英外相의 活躍으로 一時 妥協 成立을 傳하엿으나 佛伊의 均等이 解決困難한 데다가 六年 佛海軍側의 海軍建造計劃 言明으로 反復 紛紏되어 언제 解決될지 모르는 狀態에 잇다.

支拂猶豫案
獨逸賠償은 영案에 依하야 年賠償 平均 10億 2千 540萬圓 當分 8億臺로 定하얏으나 世界恐慌, 物價暴落으로 獨逸은 約 三割 負擔을 增加한 셈으로 되엇다. 이에 잇어서 獨逸首相과 外相은 英國을 訪問하야 救濟策을 請하고 他의 列强과도 呼訴하엿다. 此結果 米大統領 후버氏는 6月20日 賠償戰債支拂 一個年 延期案을 提議하얏다. 이러기前 米國政府는 藏相 멜른氏를 渡歐케하야 世界不況의 一因이 獨逸의 財政的 破産에 잇는 與否를 調査케 하엿다. 후버氏의 猶豫案 提議는 實로 멜른 藏相의 「獨逸危殆」라는 一電에 依하야 決定된 것이라 傳한다. 후버, 멜른 兩氏 此 猶豫案에 依하야 1930年 9月의 總選擧 以來 獨逸의 不況에 乘하야 賠償 蕩減을 슬로간으로 俄然 得勢한 國粹社會黨의 革命을 防止하고 米國의 對獨 債權을 保障할 수 잇으리라 信하얏섯으나 獨逸의 破産的 狀態는 그만한 注射로는 듣지 않앗다. 一方 獨逸의 政治的 不安은 그 對外信用을 損傷하야 二箇月 間에 約 九億馬克의 資本逃避로 되고 獨逸 財界는 아주 破産의 奈落으로 떠러젓다. 이에 英米佛伊 等 賠償關係 七國은 7月 倫敦에 會合하야 獨財界 救濟의 三箇 條項을 決定하엿다. 그러나 此 支拂猶豫案이 一時的 캄풀 注射인 줄 아는 各國 金融財政家와 識者間에는 賠償戰債 蕩減論이 有力하게 提唱되는 中이며 十月 中 渡米한 佛 라발首相과 후버 大統領 會見에 잇어서도 或種의 諒解가 成立되어 將次 歐洲側에서 다시 猶豫 或은 輕減案을 提議하기로 되엇다 한다.

獨墺關稅同盟 問題
獨墺關稅同盟은 3月21日 兩國 間의 關稅를 撤廢하야 外交에 對한 稅率을 同一히 하고 그 收入은 適當히 分配한다는 것인데 그 目的은 墺地利의 經濟 困難을 救濟하고 同國 農産物의 大市場을 獨逸에 求하고 獨逸 工業製品의 市場을 墺國에 開拓한다는 것이다. 이 問題는 歐洲 外交界에 一大 論爭을 惹起하얏으며 佛國은 獨墺 合倂運動의 前提라하 야 其 廢棄를 主張하얏다. 結局 國際司法裁判所에서 附議되어 五對 四로 獨逸이 敗하기 數日 前 自進 廢棄하고 말앗다.

英總選擧와 印度問題
第二次 勞働黨 內閣은 8月 14日 總辭職하얏다. 其 原因은 32年度 卽 明年度 豫算面에 當然 生할 12億圓 缺損외 補塡方法으로 失業保險金 節約 6億 6千 5百萬圓@ 對하야 勞働組合側이 反對하엿음으로 閣僚間에 意見이 不一致한 까닭이다. 又 一說에는 米國 銀行界의 巨手가 英蘭銀行에 對하야 失業保險의 實際的 節約을 實現치 않으면 對英信用을 不許한다고 壓迫한 까닭이라고도 傳한다. 그러나 조지 5世폐하의 御斡旋으로 맥도날드氏는 保守黨 自由黨으로 더부러 經濟國難 救濟로 超黨派的 擧國一致 內閣을 組織하게 되엇다. 이 까닭에 勞働黨은 大分裂이 되고 自由黨도 分派가 되고 말앗다. 擧國一致內閣은 國難 打開의 超黨派的 內閣인만큼 赤字補塡과 失業保險金 節約을 議會의 別承認 없이 獨裁的으로 可決하고 信任을 國民에 問하는 意味로 9月 議會를 解散하야 10月 27日 總選擧 結果는 政府側의 壓倒的 勝利, 野黨 勞働黨의 大慘敗를 보게 되엇다. 이는 獨逸 總選擧, 佛國 大統領選擧, 日本 府懸議選擧 等으로 더부러 獨裁的 政治傾向과 한가지로 ＜3＞ 世界的 大勢가 右傾하얏다는 것으로 볼 수 잇을 것이다. 與黨의 中心勢力이 保守黨인 關係로 現 內閣은 內地産業 保護를 爲한 保護關稅政策을 採用할 것은 分明한 事實로서 自治領 植民地와는 特惠 關稅를 締結하야 大英 經濟帝國主義를 出現하게 될 것이니 그리되면 더욱 搾取 當할 印度 等의 反抗運動도 一層 猛烈하게 될 것이다. 猛烈한 인도의 反英運動에 對하야 對策에 窮한 英國에는 英印圓卓會議를 考案하게 되엇다. 國民議會派를 除한 少數 各派를 모와 昨 11月 中旬부터 금년 1월 하순까지 倫敦에 會商하야 第二次 政治改革 草案을 作成하얏다. 그러나 實質的으로는 國際財政外亊�의 三大部門에 잇어서 重大한 保留가 잇어 獨立를 標榜하는 깐디 一派의 要求를 滿足시킬 性質의 것이 아니다. 會議進行 中 遠捕되엇든 깐디 一派가 釋放되고 깐디 어윈總督間에 休戰條約이 締結되어 1930-31年의 大騷擾는 一段落을 告한 狀態로 되엇다. 그리하야 1931年 9月中 開催되는 第二次 圓卓會議에 깐디氏가 國民議會派 唯一의 代表로 渡來하야 自黨의 要求를 提出하기로 되엇다.
圓卓會議는 英國의 政變 等으로 얼마동안 開催되다가 至今 中止狀態에 잇거니와 인도는 英國에 對한 生命線이니 聖雄이라 稱하는 깐디氏는 非常한 聰明한 政治家로서 成算이 잇어 參加한 것이겟지마는 그 成功은 疑問이라 아니할 수 없다.

露國五個年計劃
資本主義 各國이 모다 不況으로 헐덕어리고 잇는 가운데 홀로 超然한 國家는 社會主義國家 勞農露西亞로서 모든 産業部門에 잇어서 「資本主義的 先進國을 追跡하야 追越한다」는 目的을 第一 速히, 第一 巧妙하게 수행하기 爲하야 國民經濟發展 五個年 計劃이란 것이 出來하게 되엇다. 此 五個年 計劃은 1929年度부터 33年度까지를 包含한 各 産業部門에 亘한 廣汎한 것인데 此 計劃의 骨子가 되는 것은 工業化와 農業經濟의 社會主義化이다. 第一年度, 第二年度에 잇어 豫想 外의 好成績을 發揮한 바 1930年 10月부터 開始 되는 第三年度에 入하야는 全農家의 半數 以上을 協同經營化하고 又 工業化를 行하야 此 年度만으로 戰前의 工業生産에 匹敵케 하려는 中이다.

滿洲事變
1931年度 弱小民族運動으로는 오죽 印度의 反英運動을 들 수가 잇으나 前年의 猛烈한 抗爭이 잇엇슴에 比하야 今年에는 깐디, 어윈卿의 協定 및 第二 圓卓會議參加等으로 反英運動은 休戰狀態에 入하얏으며, 半植民地運動으로는 中國이 希望많은 新年을 迎하야 國定 稅率을 元且부터 實施하고 意氣 軒昻한 바 잇엇다. 그러나 領事裁判權 撤廢, 治外法權 廢棄는 英美佛日 等 列强의 强硬態度로 聲明 或은 便法公布에 불과하얏고 和蘭 諾威 兩國과의 交涉에 成功하얏을 뿐이다. 그리고 日中間에는 萬寶山事件, 朝鮮事件 等이 發生하야 交涉도 開始하기 前 中村大尉事件이 起하고 滿洲事變이 勃發하얏다. 이는 一九三一年度 國際戰爭의 最重大事實로서 그 發端은 滿鐵爆破로 起하엿다 하나 南滿鐵道 問題를 비롯한 諸 懸案의 紛擾로 險惡한 感情이 싸히고 싸혀 爆發 되엇다는 것이 妥當한 觀察일 것이다. 世界的 大衝動을 惹起하엿음은 勿論으로 米國이 動하고 國際聯盟이 問題解決에 努力하고 잇는 中인데 今番 事變과 日中間 諸 懸案 解決은 別 問題라 하야 11月 16日까지에 于先 日本에 撤兵을 要求하는 決議案까지 滿洲事變으로 開催된 理事會에 提出되엇다. 그 結果는 13對 1 卽 日本만의 反對投票로 可決되엇는데 效力發生에는 滿場一致를 要하는 關係로 成立은 못게되엇으나 理事會報告에는 儼然히 남아 잇게되어 日本에 對한 國際的關係는 不利하게 되엇다. 11月 16日, 다시 開催될 聯盟理事會에서 形勢가 어떠케 돌아갈지는 豫測할 수 없으나 此 事變의 解決 如何는 日中兩國의 死活에 關한 重大問題이다. 此 事變에 刺戟되어 中國에는 南廣統一運動이 起하얏으나 最近 形勢로는 아주 樂觀은 不許하게 되엇으니 中國은 現在 重大 國難엊� 處하여잇는 南廣統一會議가 最初의 氣勢에 比하야 시원치 않게 된 것은 蔣氏의 下野 取消로서 그 裏面에는 英公使 람프손氏가 蔣張兩氏의 下野를 ＜4＞ 斷念케 하고 支援하는 態度를 表示한 關係로서 英國의 南中一帶 利權을 保障하기 爲함이라 認한다. 英國의 이 態度는 聯盟理事會에도 表現 되엇으니 이는 極東 關係에 重大한 影響을 주는 것이라 할 것이다.
以上 述한 諸 事實은 此를 要컨대 언제 好轉될지 알 수 없는 慢性的 不況은 資本主義의 崩壞를 招來하야 國內 國際的 諸 問題를 提起하엿다 할 것이다. ＜5＞
