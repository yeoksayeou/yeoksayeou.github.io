Arrest of Secret Meeters Mistaken for Party Members

At a time when a wave of arrests was raging due to the Chosŏn Communist Party reorganization incident centered around Kyŏngsŏng Imperial University students, one day on Kwanghwamun Avenue (光化門通), a certain detective from the Pon-ch'o Police Station (本町署), having received advance intelligence that a "report" (레포) exchange was to happen there, spotted a certain higher common school student standing waiting for someone. Without a moment's hesitation, he seized the student and escorted him to the Pon-ch'o Police Station. After thoroughly investigating him amidst much commotion, the words that came out of the young man's mouth were reportedly the confession of a secret meeting (密會): he had been waiting for his girlfriend, a certain female student. <95>

**Summary**

This short news report describes an incident during a crackdown on suspected communist activity in colonial Seoul. A police detective, acting on intelligence about a clandestine meeting related to the Chosŏn Communist Party reorganization, arrested a high school student on Kwanghwamun Avenue. However, upon investigation, it was discovered the student was merely waiting to secretly meet his girlfriend. This anecdote highlights the atmosphere of suspicion and the heavy-handed policing during the period, where even innocent rendezvous could be mistaken for subversive political activity. For historians, it illustrates the pervasive nature of colonial surveillance and the paranoia surrounding communist movements, impacting everyday life and leading to potentially arbitrary arrests.
