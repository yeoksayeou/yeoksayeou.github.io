**Body Text Translation:**
Record of What Almost Was: What Ambition Did I Have in My Boyhood?

The Sima Qian of Chosŏn
Asahi President An Chaehong

Since my family were loyalists (勤皇黨) for generations, influenced by the patriotic thought of the time, I always felt the inadequacy of Chosŏn history and had the ambition to become the Sima Qian of Chosŏn.

(Reporter's comment - Now I finally understand the ambition of the president's childhood.)<34>

**Summary**

An Chaehong, identified here by his title as President of the Asahi [likely referring to a Korean context, perhaps related to newspaper affiliations, though Asahi is primarily known as Japanese], recounts his boyhood ambition. Influenced by his family's long-standing loyalist (勤皇黨) background and a sense of deficiency in Korean historiography, he aspired to become the "Sima Qian of Chosŏn," implying a desire to compile a comprehensive and foundational history for Korea. This brief recollection highlights the intersection of nationalist sentiment, historical consciousness, and personal ambition among Korean intellectuals during the colonial period. Historians might find the explicit mention of his family being "loyalists" (勤皇黨) and the specific aspiration to emulate Sima Qian for Chosŏn's history particularly interesting for understanding the intellectual currents and nationalist motivations of the time.
