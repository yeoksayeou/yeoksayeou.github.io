Flower Garden
						Sŏnu Kisŏng

The slender sprout, planted and emerged,
In midsummer today,
Bearing a beautiful crown and colorful guests,
Solemnly and brilliantly,
Spreading wide its many green leafy branches,
Amidst those who leap about and make commotion,
Swaying, swaying, it is playing.

I, to plant those flower seeds,
To tend those emerged shoots,
Did not spare giving there
My affection, strength, and love that I possess,
And so, that yard, once desolate like an old site
And disordered with various weeds,
Has become a splendid flower hill.

So, my heart is joyful.
As the sun sets and my love enters the darkness,
Though I regrettably left there,
In the early morning, to see the face that greets the morning sun with a smile,
When I go out soon—
That which I long for,
That which adores me,
How could it not welcome me?
Truly, the object of beautiful Love (愛) is there.<38>

**Summary**

The poem "Flower Garden" by Sŏnu Kisŏng expresses the deep affection and joy the speaker feels for a garden they personally cultivated. It contrasts the garden's current vibrant state with its previous desolation, emphasizing the transformative power of the speaker's dedicated effort, love, and care. The garden becomes a reciprocal entity, a beloved object that seems to return the speaker's adoration, eagerly awaited each morning. From a historical perspective, the poem offers insight into personal modes of finding meaning and beauty during the colonial period, focusing on individual creation and connection with nature rather than overt political themes. The language itself, with its older Korean orthography and grammatical forms typical of the 1930s, is also of historical linguistic interest.

花園
						鮮于基聖
심거 돋은 가늘은 싻이
한여름 오늘날엔
아름답은 면류관과 채색의 손님을 이고
엄숙하고도 찬란하게
푸른 여러 닢가지를 넓게 펴고
뛰노는 소동하는 이 가운데서
흔들흔들 노을고 잇음머.

나는 그 꽃씨를 심누라구
그 똗은 엄을 가꾸누라구
나의 가진 정과 힘과 사랑을
게다가 베플기를 아끼지 않엇으매
옛터같이 쓸쓸하고 너느 풀로서 어즈럽던
그 마당이 화려한 꽃동산이 되엇음머.

그래 내 마음이 즐겁도다
해저므러 검은 데로 내 사랑이 들어 감으로
애석히도 거게를 떠낫으나
이른 아츰이면 그 아츰해를 반겨 웃는 낯을 보려고
곳 나가누란적
내가 동경하는 그것이
나를 사모하는 그것이
아닐선 반기지
진실로 아름다운 愛의 대상은 거기에 잇음머.＜38＞
