My Mother
						Yi Wŏnjo

Trying to fathom Mother's heart by shaping my own mind,
I bow my head at the desk and ponder deeply.
A breadth I cannot know—that, I think, is Mother.

Her milk dried up, her strength waned, she cannot do the work she used to;
Even moving her body is difficult, so how could she raise me?
Yet, seeing her exert herself in vain day by day makes me sadder still.

Lest the heart, degraded by poverty, disappear when the stomach is full,
The memory of her giving me even the single spoonful of rice that appeared,
Now makes hot tears flow, soaking the collar of my clothes.

When I kicked off the blanket in my sleep, exposing my shoulders,
The memory of her quietly covering me and silently leaving—
Even if I lay naked upon the snow, I would not know the cold.

Though I grow more distant from her touch as I grow taller each year,
Her heart, like when she breastfed me in the past, remains just as young [towards me].
How much more worried must her heart be, having sent me ten thousand *li* away?

I do not even fully grasp how she raised me with words and deeds,
But how much more abundant was her unspoken love?
As I go on my lonely way, I think of her all the more.<86>

**Summary**

This poem by Yi Wŏnjo expresses deep filial piety and longing for his mother. The speaker reflects on his mother's boundless, unknowable love, her sacrifices despite physical decline and poverty (giving him her meager food, tending to him in his sleep), and her enduring concern even as he grows up and moves far away. The poem is filled with tender memories and a sense of guilt and gratitude, culminating in the realization that her unspoken love was immense and that his current loneliness brings her memory even closer. From a historical perspective, the poem offers a poignant glimpse into the hardships of life, likely exacerbated by poverty common during the colonial period. The emphasis on maternal sacrifice and enduring family bonds amidst scarcity provides insight into the values and emotional landscape cherished by Koreans during that era, making it valuable for historians studying social conditions and personal sentiment.

나의 어머니
						李源朝
내 마음 빚어내여 어머니 정 알까하야
책상 앞 고개수겨 곰곰이 생각하나.
어떤 줄 모를 넓히가 어머닌가 하노라

젖줄고 힘줄으니 예 하든 일 못하시데
몸 긔동도 어렵거든 나를 어이 키우랴만
나날이 헛애만 쓰시는 양 더욱 설어하노라.

가난에 천해진 맘 배불으면 없을세라
한수깔 샌긴 밥도 제게 먼저 주시든 일
지금에 뜨거운 눈물이 옷깃 저저 흐르네.

잠껼에 이불 차서 억개가 드러날 때
가만이 덮어주며 소리없이 나가시든 일
눈 우에 벗고 누어도 추운 둘을 모를레라.

해마다 자랄사록 손 끝에 멀어지나
예런 듯 젖 먹이든 맘 한갈같이 어린 것을
만리에 떠나 보내신 맘 더욱 오작하리까.

말로 일로 길러주심 그것조차 다 모르나
말없이 사랑하심 더 얼마나 많으신고
제 몸이 외로워 가니 더욱 생각납네다.＜86＞
