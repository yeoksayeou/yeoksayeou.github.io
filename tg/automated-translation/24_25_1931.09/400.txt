Ode After Rain Again
						Kim Su-yŏng (金壽泳)

How cool it is after a single shower!
As heaven and earth are fresh, even the wind seems clear,
Where the clouds have lifted, a rainbow has appeared.

Clear water covers the rocks, flowing and flowing,
The village womenfolk are busy doing laundry,
Their flushed faces, too, seem to have cleared brightly.

The weir water, choked, flows over the paddy dike,
In the fields, yellow bees (버리), wet from the rain, are hovering,
The village people are busy working in the cleared fields.<79>

**Summary**

This poem by Kim Su-yŏng depicts a vibrant and refreshing scene in the Korean countryside immediately following a rain shower. It describes the clear sky, a rainbow, flowing water, village women washing clothes with brightened faces, overflowing irrigation water, rain-soaked bees, and villagers returning to work in the fields. The poem celebrates the rejuvenating effect of rain on nature and human activity. From a historical perspective, the poem offers a glimpse into the idealized depiction of rural Korean life during the colonial period. While seemingly apolitical, its focus on the beauty and resilience of nature and simple village life might implicitly contrast with or offer an escape from the harsher realities of colonial rule, making it potentially interesting to historians studying cultural expressions of the era.

雨後又頌
						金壽泳
소내기 한 줄기에 시원키도 하온지고
하늘 따 산뜻하매 바람조차 맑을세라
구름이 걷힌 자리에 무지개가 버첫더라.

맑은 물 바위 덮어 흐르느니 흐르는다
마을에 여인네들 빨래하기 바뻣고야
그들의 끄른 얼골도 맑게 갠 듯 하오라.

보물은 목이 메여 논 뚝 넘께 흘러 들고
밭에는 누른 버리 비에 젖어 너울긴다
말 사람 비 갠 들녁에 일하노라 바뻐라.＜79＞
