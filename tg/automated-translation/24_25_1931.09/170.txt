Letter

Today again, upon the river,
I set it afloat.

Though I wrote it,
having nowhere to send it,
into the flowing waves,
I cast it.

Untitled

When sorrow like a cloud
blooms forth,
the high sky's blue end,
I gaze upon.
When thoughts like waves
rise up within,
the wide sea's blue water,
I look upon.

Waiting

At night,
snow, without a sound,
falls and piles up.
Besides the passing wind,
there's no one who has brushed by.
As spring snow melts in spring,
it will surely melt away,
so I wait for footsteps,
asking for tracks to be made.<31>

**Summary**

This article presents three short poems by P'i Ch'ŏndŭk titled "Letter," "Untitled," and "Waiting." The poems explore themes of unspoken feelings, longing, sorrow, and hopeful anticipation. "Letter" expresses the sadness of having sentiments with no recipient, "Untitled" depicts finding solace in nature's vastness during moments of inner turmoil, and "Waiting" uses the metaphor of snow to convey a quiet, persistent hope for connection or change. From a historical perspective, these poems, published in 1931 during the Japanese colonial period, offer insight into personal, perhaps subtly expressed, feelings of melancholy, displacement (the unsendable letter), and quiet endurance ("Waiting") that might reflect the broader atmosphere of the era for Koreans, even without overt political commentary. Historians might find the gentle lyricism and the focus on individual emotion within this context noteworthy.

小曲三篇
						피천득
편지
오늘도 강물에
띄웟세요.

쓰기는 썻것만
부칠 데 없어
흘르는 물결에
던젓세요.

無題
서름이 구름같이
피어날 때면
높은 하늘 파란 귿
쳐다봅니다.
물결같이 심사가
일어날 때면
넓은 바다 푸른 물
바라봅니다.

기다림
밤이면
눈이 소리없이
나려서 쌓이지오.
지나간 바람밖엔
스친 분도 없지오.
봄이면 봄눈 슬 듯
슬고야 말터이니
자욱을 내달라고
발자취를 기달려요.＜31＞
