A Record of What Almost Was: What Kind of Ambition Did I Have in My Youth?
The Chief of a Mountain Stronghold

Products Promotion Association
Myŏng Che-se

Since I was young, I enjoyed a wandering life and gathered many sworn brothers. If the times had been good, I would have emulated the 108 heroes of Liangshan Marsh (梁山泊) and become the great king of a mountain stronghold.
(Reporter's comment: Sir, your beard and sideburns certainly give you the air of a chief.)

It's Truly Baffling

Reporter Ch'oe Ŭi-sun

I don't know. Really, I don't know. I'll tell you later. Let's leave it for a bit.
Why, did I study chemistry? It's truly baffling. I'll let you know later. Is there anyone whose life turns out the way they originally thought?
(Reporter's comment: I regret not asking whether she regrets becoming a reporter instead of a chemistry teacher.)<94>

**Summary**

This article presents two short, contrasting reminiscences about youthful ambitions. Myŏng Che-se, associated with the Products Promotion Association, recalls wanting to be a bandit chief like the heroes of Liangshan Marsh, a bold and perhaps implicitly anti-establishment fantasy given the colonial context. Female reporter Ch'oe Ŭi-sun is much more reticent, deflecting questions about her past ambition (implied to be chemistry) and expressing resignation that life rarely goes as planned. From a historical perspective, Myŏng's piece offers a glimpse into fantasies of autonomy or rebellion, referencing a classic Chinese tale of outlaws, perhaps subtly channeling dissatisfaction with the times. Ch'oe's hesitant response might reflect the societal constraints placed on women's ambitions or a general caution common during the colonial period. The mention of the Products Promotion Association (물산장려회) also grounds Myŏng's piece in the nationalist economic movement of the era.

(기자왈, 선생의 수염과 구레나룻은 두목의 풍채가 상당합니다.)
