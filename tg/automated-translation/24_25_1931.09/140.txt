My Heart Grows Hot!
						Song Sun-il

Even if the cicada's sound is chilly
My heart grows hot!
Ah, is it already autumn?
Though only inner leaves sprout at the treetop...

Though the spring water is cold
My heart grows hot!
The spring water flows and flows
Becoming a river, an ocean...

Even if the starlight is cool
My heart grows hot!
It twinkles all night long
But from me, what light...<26>

**Summary**

This poem by Song Sun-il expresses a contrast between the external coolness of the approaching autumn season and the speaker's persistent inner warmth or passion. Using imagery of cicada sounds, new leaves, cold spring water flowing to the sea, and cool starlight, the speaker repeatedly affirms "My heart grows hot!" The poem concludes on a reflective note, questioning what kind of "light" emanates from the speaker, unlike the twinkling stars. From a historical perspective, the poem reflects personal lyricism during the colonial period. While primarily about nature and inner feeling, the contrast between external chill and internal heat could potentially be interpreted by historians as reflecting a resilient spirit or suppressed passion amidst the difficult circumstances of the time, even if not explicitly political. The use of early 20th-century Korean orthography is also of linguistic interest.

내 가슴 뜨거워지는고나
						宋順鎰
맴이 소린 쌀쌀해도
내 가슴 뜨거워지는고나!
아아, 벌서 가을인가
나무 끝엔 속닢만 나는데...

샘물이 차다마는
내 가슴 뜨거워지는고나!
샘물은 흘러흘러
강바다 되는데...

별빛은 싸늘해도
내 가슴 뜨거워지는고나!
밤새도록 반짝이는데
나에게선 무슨 빛이...＜26＞
