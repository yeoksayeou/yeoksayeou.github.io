Unchanging Heart
						Kim Ansŏ

1
How easily this heart of mine changes like the sky's color,
The wind blows, and the floating clouds leave no trace.
Though I weep for you on this lonely day,
When the wind blows in the distant future, I might lose you.

2
Though my heart is gone, there's no way to turn it back.
Let go of my sleeve, my dear, and cease your weeping.
Water ripples cannot rise without the wind,
How would I know your sorrowful plight just because you cry?

3
I forget you; is there any way to move
This turned-away, mute heart? How heartless it is.
Though clouds in the blue sky are born of the wind,
That very wind, they say, makes the sky clear.
1931.5.30 At Ahyŏn <17>

**Summary**

This poem, "Unchanging Heart," contrasts the fleeting nature of clouds and wind with the speaker's resolved, albeit perhaps sorrowful, decision to end a relationship. The speaker acknowledges the pain of separation but insists their mind is made up ("mute heart") and cannot be swayed by tears, comparing their final state to a sky cleared by the very wind that brought the clouds. From a historical perspective, the poem, written during the Japanese colonial period, showcases the continuation of Korean lyrical expression focusing on personal emotion. While not explicitly political, the publication of such works in the Korean language, exploring themes of change, loss, and resolve, contributes to understanding the cultural and emotional landscape of Koreans during that era, reflecting individual experiences amidst broader societal constraints.

不變心
						金岸曙
1
하늘빛은 이 내 맘 변키 쉽고나,
바람부니 뜬 구름 자최가 없네.
외론 이 날 그대를 내가 울으나,
먼 후일 바람 불젠 그대 잃으리.

2
없는 맘야 나연만 돌릴 길 없네.
소매 놓게 그대여 울음 끄치라.
물쌀은 바람 없이 못 이는 거니,
설은 신세 운다고 내가 알것가.

3
내 잊노라 돌아선 벙어리 맘을
울릴 길야 잇는가, 모심하고나.
프른 하늘 구름은 바람에 나나
그 바람에 하늘은 맑노라누나.
