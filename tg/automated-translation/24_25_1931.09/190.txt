An "Almost Became" Chronicle: What Kind of Ambitions Did I Have in My Boyhood?
I've forgotten.
Yi Sang-hyŏp, President of the Chungoe Ilbo

I've forgotten it all. Because ambitions keep changing. When I saw someone wearing a sword, I wanted to wear a sword; when I saw someone wearing an official's hat (관), I wanted to wear an official's hat.

Reporter says—Since you became a newspaperman, an uncrowned king, it's like you've worn the hat; since you carry the brush, said to be sharper (利하다) than a sword (刀劍), there's nothing more for you to envy. <33>

**Summary**

Yi Sang-hyŏp, president of the Chungoe Ilbo newspaper, responds evasively when asked about his childhood ambitions, stating he forgot them as they changed often – wanting to wear a sword or an official's hat depending on who he saw. The reporter counters that as a newspaper president ("uncrowned king") wielding a pen ("sharper than a sword"), he has essentially achieved analogous forms of power and influence. From a colonial history perspective, this short piece is interesting as it subtly equates the influence of a Korean newspaper publisher under Japanese rule with traditional symbols of authority (sword, official's hat), potentially highlighting the press as a significant sphere of non-governmental influence or ambition for Koreans during that era. The author's initial deflection could also hint at the complexities and perhaps dangers of openly discussing past "ambitions" under colonial scrutiny.

될뻔記, 나는 소년시절에 어떠한 야심을 가젓섯나
잊어버렷소
中外日報社長 李相協
다 잊어버렷소. 야심이란 작구 변하니까요. 칼 찬 사람 보면 칼 차고 십고 관 쓴 사람 보면 관 쓰고 싶엇지오.
기자 왈-無冠의 제왕인 신문가가 되엇으니 관을 쓰신 셈이요, 刀劍보다 利하다는 붓을 차섯으니 더 부러워하실 것 없습니다.＜33＞
