Will You Go On Like That?
						By Cho Chong-hyŏn

1
I had believed you were a comrade.
I had proclaimed that you were the one.
To betray trust like this, you awfully wicked person.

2
Go on, go where you will—do you think it will be any different there?
That place too is where people live; it will surely be the same.
What is there to wander about? Only time passes by.

3
Let's not hope for the next time, even if you come having done great things.
It cannot be better than holding hands and worrying together today.
When joy overflows, who wouldn't know how to laugh?

- June 26th, From Hansŏng -<86>

**Summary**

This poem expresses feelings of betrayal and disillusionment towards a former comrade who has broken the speaker's trust. The speaker dismisses the idea that leaving will lead to a better situation, emphasizing that life is similar everywhere and that time simply passes. The poem concludes by valuing present solidarity and shared hardship over uncertain future achievements, suggesting that true connection lies in facing difficulties together, while joy is a universal, easily shared emotion. From a historical perspective, the poem could reflect the personal or political schisms and disillusionments experienced by Koreans during the colonial period. The themes of broken trust among "comrades" and the questioning of future prospects versus present reality might hint at the complexities and pressures within nationalist or social movements, or simply the personal struggles of maintaining relationships under duress.

그러구로 가련가
						趙宗玄
1
그대를 동지라구 나는 믿어 왓더니라
일할이 그대라구 나는 웨처 왓더니라
신의를 저바리다니 예기 몹슬 사람아.

2
갈 때로 가 보아라 거기엔덜 별 다르랴
거긔도 사람 산 곧 도로 마챤가지일 걸
해맬 것 무엇 잇느냐 때만 지내가느니.

3
다음을 바라쟌네 큰 일 하여 온다해도
오늘날 손 맞잡고 걱정함만 못할세라
기쁨이 넘치일 때면 뉘 웃을 줄 모르랴.
