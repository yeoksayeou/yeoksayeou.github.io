[By 李光洙 (Yi Kwangsu)]

"Do not set your mind on living, but only set your mind on dying. Fight to the death for the sake of the country. If there is anyone who violates military orders in the slightest, military law shall be enforced." (李舜臣 - Yi Sunsin)

[By 金一大 (Kim Iltae)]

What is the duty we must perform at our current stage? Let us re-examine once more the three conditions clearly revealed in the platform of our society (朝鮮農民社 - Chosŏn Nongminsa) and conclude with this.

First. To aim for securing the right to live amidst the realistic anxieties of the peasant masses.

Second. To aim for the conscious training of the peasant masses.

Third. To support the overall movement through the unity of the peasant masses. (農民 - Nongmin [Farmer] October issue) <43>

**Summary**

This entry consists of two short, distinct pieces. The first, by prominent writer Yi Kwangsu, presents a stark quote from Admiral Yi Sunsin emphasizing absolute loyalty, self-sacrifice for the nation, and strict military discipline. The second piece, by Kim Iltae, outlines the three core tenets of the Chosŏn Nongminsa (Korean Peasant Society): securing peasants' livelihoods against current hardships, raising their consciousness through training, and achieving solidarity for a broader movement. From a colonial history perspective, the juxtaposition is interesting: Yi Kwangsu invokes a figure of past military glory and sacrifice, perhaps appealing to nationalist sentiment through historical heroism, while Kim Iltae focuses on the immediate socio-economic struggles and organizational goals of the contemporary peasant movement under colonialism. Historians might find the different focuses indicative of varying strands within Korean thought at the time regarding national identity and practical action.
