**Summary**

This biographical entry from the "Contemporary Figures Dictionary" section of the November 1, 1932 issue of *Tonggwang* magazine profiles Kim Sin-sil, a professor at Ewha Specialized School (now Ewha Womans University). It details her academic background (A.B. degree, education in Kyŏngsŏng, Hawaii, and Oberlin College in Ohio), professional experience as a professor, extensive involvement in Christian and women's organizations like the YWCA and the Korean Women's Relief Society (both past and present roles), and personal interests (drama, music, sports). The profile notes she is from Kyŏngsŏng and has three daughters. For historians, this profile offers a valuable snapshot of an elite, highly educated Korean woman during the colonial period. Her international education (USA) and active leadership roles in prominent organizations like the YWCA highlight the pathways available to some Korean women for higher education and social engagement, often linked with Christianity and Western influences, within the constraints of Japanese colonial rule.
