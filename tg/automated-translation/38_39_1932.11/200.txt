Modern Figures Dictionary (現代人名辭典) (11) <41>

**Summary**

This article provides a biographical sketch of Hŏ Hŏn (Heo Heon), a prominent Korean lawyer and nationalist figure, as of November 1932. It details his background, including birth date, place, family, extensive education in both traditional Korean and modern Japanese institutions (including law), his early career in government, transition to law, involvement in establishing schools, and significant roles in nationalist organizations like the Sŏbuk Hakhoe and especially the Sin'ganhoe, where he served as Chairman. It also notes his imprisonment for two years related to the "Mass Rally Incident" and his business affiliations. For historians, this profile offers a valuable snapshot of a key figure in the Korean independence movement during the colonial period. It highlights the background of elite Koreans involved in resistance, their educational paths, organizational activities (like the significant Sin'ganhoe), the risks they faced (imprisonment), and their connections within colonial society, including business directorships alongside their political activities. The mention of his world travel is also noteworthy for the era.
