**Summary**

This brief article from the November 1932 issue of *Tonggwang* magazine provides a biographical profile of Hyŏn Sangyun, the principal of Chungang High Common School at the time. It lists his pen name, birth date, family details (including his wife's name, his age - 43, and number of children), educational background (ranging from classical Chinese studies to graduation from Waseda University in Japan), and current position. His interests are noted as wide-ranging reading and travel. From a historical perspective, the profile highlights the educational path of a prominent Korean intellectual during the colonial period, including study at both traditional Korean institutions (like Taesŏng School, associated with the nationalist movement) and a Japanese university (Waseda). His leadership role at Chungang High Common School, a key private Korean school, underscores the efforts in maintaining Korean education under Japanese rule. Historians might find the specific details of his education, family, and position useful for understanding the Korean elite and educational landscape of the 1930s.
