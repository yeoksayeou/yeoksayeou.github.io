**Summary**

This biographical entry details the background of Kim Yŏ-sik, the principal of Hyŏpsŏng Commercial and Technical School in 1932. Born in North P'yŏngan Province, he received traditional Hanmun education before pursuing extensive studies in the United States from 1912. His American education included Massanutten Military Academy, a B.A. (1919) and likely an M.A. (1921) from the State University of Iowa, and a Ph.D. in Political Science and International Public Law from American University (1921). He was a Christian and residing in Seoul (Kyŏngsŏng) at the time. For historians, this profile highlights the existence of highly educated Korean elites, particularly those with Western (specifically American) doctorates, who played significant roles within the Korean community, such as leading private educational institutions like Hyŏpsŏng, during the Japanese colonial period. His specialization in political science and international law acquired abroad is particularly noteworthy given the political context of Korea at the time.
