Critique of the Girls' School Review
						Ihwa Chŏnmun L.I.S

Regarding the "Girls' School Review" (女學校評判記) published in the July and September issues of Tonggwang, while most points likely warrant指摘 (pointing out) and 抗議 (protest) from each respective girls' school regarding its slanderous critique (妄評), I wish first to critique the "Girls' School Critique" by the 'Mining King' (鑛山王) of Kyŏngsŏng Higher Technical School (京城高工). This is because, perhaps influenced by the recent gold rush era, the Mining King's critique of girls' schools is the most egregious (尤甚) among the slanderous critiques. Although the Mining King's entire critique of girls' schools is filled with misjudgments (誤見) and shallow knowledge (淺識), I intend to speak only about the critique concerning Ihwa Women's College (梨花專門), with which I am affiliated.

His critique of Ihwa is as follows:
Kyŏngsŏng Girls' Schools Quantitative Analysis Table (京城 各 女學校 定量 分析表)
Ihwa Chŏn... Academics (學業) 05, Vivacity (活潑) 30, Appearance (姿色) 15, Simplicity (質朴)... Trace (痕跡), Luxury (奢侈) 50

The Mining King from the Higher Technical School, who presented the above Quantitative Analysis Table of characteristics, firstly lacks even basic common sense about mining (鑛業). A quantitative analysis report (定量 分析表) of ore (鑛石) involves receiving a sample (標品) from a mine owner or client, analyzing it, and secretly sending (密送) the results report to the client. If the pure gold content of the ore or other analysis results are poor, it is absolutely not publicly disclosed (公示) to others. One who does not know this principle, no matter how much he may call himself a Mining King (自稱 鑛山王), this writer cannot help but call him a Mad Dog King (狂狦王).

However, the Mad Dog King might retort (反駁) to this writer that he presented not a quantitative analysis table of ore, but a Quantitative Analysis Table of characteristics of Kyŏngsŏng's girls' schools. Alright, if that's the case, he should drop the title 'Mining King' and rather call himself a Braggart Bugler (虛吹唐喇叭軍); perhaps then he might have avoided ignorance (免無識).<76> The few words written above are by no means merely a rebuttal aimed at refuting the Mad Dog King, but rather just a lecture on the introduction to the way of the Mining King (鑛山王道).

Looking at the total score in the Mad Dog King's critique, he rated Ihwa students' Luxury (奢侈) as 10 times their Academics (學業). Then, where did the Mad Dog King investigate Ihwa students' academic performance (學業成績) in such detail? Truly, I who ask this question back am rather foolish. It must be so. Is this an age where one must study while walking on the street to be considered a student engrossed (熱中) in academics, or must one pick up a large, unfamiliar book and carry it upside down?

And he said Ihwa students' Luxury is 10 times [their Academics]. That too must be so. Depending on the color and style (色形) of clothing (衣服), regardless of whether the material (質) is cotton (木棉) or silk (絹), it's possible to exude eroticism and grotesqueness (에로 그로). However, does he not know that the Ihwa Women's College Christian Youth Association (基督敎靑年會) has been promoting and wearing our domestic products (物産) such as silk pongee (明紬), hemp cloth (麻布類), plain cotton (白木 等屬), etc., as fashionable clothing materials for 4 or 5 years already, and moreover, completely avoids wearing artificial silk (人造絹)?

Has Sir Mad Dog King not yet observed that Ihwa's skills in sewing (裁縫術) and dyeing (染色術) are advanced? The reality is that it is indeed a fact that they wear inexpensive fabrics neatly. If one views that as luxury, then he must undoubtedly be a Mad Dog King who, having only seen women in some deep mountain valley (深山幽谷) neglecting laundry, ignorant of dyeing methods, and clumsy at sewing, struck it rich (一獲 千金) in a gold mine and suddenly appeared in the great capital Kyŏngsŏng, the center of Chosŏn (朝鮮). If not, he must undoubtedly be from the janitorial staff (小使) of the proverbial Destruction University (滅X大學校) which makes luxury its business. ((In the eyes of a mad dog (狂犬之眼), even diamonds reflect as yellow dung (黃糞))) Considering it once more, if he was to publish a false (虛僞) analysis table, he might as well have put Ihwa's Luxury at 『100』 and Academics at 『0』, yet the fact that he still drew Luxury as 『50』 and Academics as 『05』 shows that the Mad Dog King has a little conscience remaining. As someone thirsty for freedom, how frustrating (痛憤) would it be if one didn't even have the freedom to tell lies that the world knows well! From this perspective, there is considerable room (餘地) to forgive him once more. It is my freedom to designate (指名) him as Mad Dog King, just as it is the critic's freedom to call himself Mining King. However, while one may have the freedom to weed around a growing pumpkin, the freedom to point fingers (손가락질) is forbidden (禁物).<77>

**Summary**

This article is a sharp rebuttal by a representative of Ihwa Women's College (likely a student or faculty member using initials L.I.S.) against a negative portrayal of the school in a previous issue of the *Tonggwang* magazine. The author specifically targets a critique written by someone self-styled "Mining King" from Kyŏngsŏng Higher Technical School, who rated Ihwa students low on academics and simplicity but high on luxury. The author mocks the "Mining King's" analogy and knowledge, defends Ihwa students' academic seriousness and frugality (highlighting their use of domestic fabrics and skills in sewing/dyeing), and dismisses the critique as ignorant slander, while sarcastically acknowledging the critic's "freedom" to lie.

From a historical perspective, this article offers insight into the social dynamics and perceptions surrounding women's higher education in colonial Korea during the 1930s. It reflects the tensions between traditional expectations and the emerging identities of educated women, the scrutiny female students faced regarding their appearance and behavior, and the discourse around consumerism (luxury vs. frugality, imported vs. domestic goods). The defense invoking the promotion of domestic products (물산장려운동) and Christian values (via the YWCA mention) also situates the debate within broader nationalist and social movements of the time. Historians might find the specific critiques (low academics, high luxury) and the detailed defense (mentioning specific fabrics, skills, and organizational activities) particularly revealing about gender stereotypes and the self-representation strategies of educated women in that era.

女學校評判記評
						梨專 L.I.S
東光 7月號와 9月號에 揭載한 「女學校評判記」에 대해서는 各 女學校가 各其 그 妄評임을 指摘 抗議할 點이 大部分일 것이나 우선 나는 京城高工 鑛山王의 「女學校評」을 評하고저 한다. 그것은 近日의 黃金狂 時代의 餘波를 받음인지 鑛山王의 女學校評이 妄評의 그 尤甚한 者인 까닭이다. 鑛山王의 女學校評은 그 全部가 誤見淺識으로 가득 찻지마는 나는 나에게 關係 잇는 梨花專門評에 대해서만 말하려 한다.
그의 梨花評判記는 다음과 같다.
京城 各 女學校 定量 分析表
梨專... 學業 05, 活潑 30, 姿色 15, 質朴... 痕跡, 奢侈 50
以上과 같은 特色 定量 分析表를 내인 高等工業學校 鑛山王은 첫재 鑛業에 대한 常識부터가 不足하다. 鑛石의 定量 分析表란 鑛主 或은 依賴者에게 標品을 받어 가지고 分析한 成績表를 依賴者에게 密送하는 것이다. 그 鑛石의 純金合量이라든가 其他 分析의 成績이 不良한 때에는 絶對로 他人에게 公示를 아니 하는 것이다. 이러한 原則을 모르는 者는 제 아모리 自稱 鑛山王이라 하여도 筆者는 狂狦王狦라고 부를 수밖에 없다.
그러나 狂狦王은 내가 鑛石의 定量 分析表를 내인 것이 아니라 京城 各 女學校 特色 定量 分析表를 내인 것이라고 도리어 筆者를 反駁할넌지 모른다. 옳아 그러타면 鑛山王이라는 稱號를 떼어 버리고 차라리 虛吹唐喇叭軍이라고 하엿드면 그런대로 免無識이나＜76＞ 되엇을런지. 우에 쓴 몇 마디 말은 決코 狂狦王을 反駁하기 위한 反駁만이 아니라 우선 鑛山王道의 入門을 講義한데 不過하다.

狂狦王의 評에 總點을 보아 梨專學生은 奢侈가 學業의 10倍라고 評을 나렷다. 그러면 狂狦王은 梨專學生의 學業成績을 어대서 그리 자세히 調査하엿든가? 참 이것을 反問하는 내가 오히려 어리석다. 그도 그럴 것이다. 행길로 다니며 책을 읽어야만 學業에 熱中한 學生이며 모르는 책이라도 큼직한 것으로 골라 꺼꾸로 들고 단녀야 되는 世上인가 보니.

그리고 梨專學生은 奢侈가 10倍라고 하엿다. 그도 그럴 것이다. 衣服에 色形를 따라 質이야 木棉이던지 絹이던지 不問하고 色形에서 에로 그로를 發散할 수 잇으니까. 그러나 梨專學生 基督敎靑年會에서는 明紬, 麻布類, 白木 等屬 等 우리 物産을 장려하여 입어 오는 것은 벌서 4, 5年前부터 流行하는 의복감, 더욱이 人造絹은 一切 着用치 안는 것을 모르는가.
狂狦王君은 梨專이 裁縫術이라든가, 染色術이 進步 되어 잇는 것을 아직도 觀察하지 못하엿든가? 實狀은 廉價의 옷감을 가지고도 깨끗하게 해입는 것만은 事實이겟다. 그러타고 그것을 奢侈로 본다면 이야말로 어떤 深山幽谷에서 洗濯을 게을리하며 染色法을 모르고 裁縫이 서투른 女子만 보고 잇다가 金鑛에서 一獲 千金하야 突然히 朝鮮의 中心 大京城에 出現한 狂狦王임에 틀님 없을 것이다. 그러치 않으면 奢侈를 營業으로 하는 俗談의 滅X大學校의 小使出身임에 틀님없다. ((狂犬之眼에는 金剛石도 反映 黃糞)) 다시 한번 考察하여 본다면 虛僞의 分析表를 發表하는 바에는 梨專에 奢侈을 『100』으로 하고 學業을 『0』으로 하렷만 그래도 奢侈로 『50』 學業을 『05』로 그려 놓은 것을 보면 狂狦王에게도 良心이 조곰 남아 잇다. 自由에 목마른 사람으로서 世上이 잘아는 거짓말을 하는 自由도 없다면 그 얼마나 痛憤한 일이겟느냐! 이 點으로 보아서 또 한번 容恕할 餘地가 相當히 잇다. 狂狦王이라고 내가 指名하는 것은 나의 自由이니 鑛山王이라고 自稱함도 評判者의 自由이리라. 그러나 자라는 호박에 김매는 自由는 가저도 손가락질 하는 自由는 禁物이다.＜77＞
