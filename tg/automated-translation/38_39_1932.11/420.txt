An Tosan's Boyhood, "Legends" Remaining in His Hometown
						By Chinnamp'o Haedang

As the world knows, Tosan An Ch'angho, currently imprisoned (囹圄中), was born in Kangso, South P'yŏngan Province. Therefore, old stories about him are newly circulating here concurrently with his imprisonment. Among them, this is a record of stories heard about his childhood and boyhood. The author cannot guarantee their truthfulness, but if these stories are true, they seem to reveal an aspect of his character and have many points that arouse interest. An Setchae (An the third child) was his childhood name.

An Setchae was born in 1878 into a poor farming family on Torong Island, Namch'on, P'yŏngyang. One day when he was fully two years old, his mother went out. Two-year-old Setchae was whining (嘶膓) because he wanted milk. He looked around for his mother, and having no other choice, went to the mother of the eldest grandson in the house in front. She was just then working at her spinning wheel (물레질, 紡績), and he quietly went behind her, lifted the collar of her clothes, and deliciously drank from one breast. The neighboring mother (隣母), believing without doubt (信之無疑) that it was her own eldest grandson, let him drink. When An Setchae detached himself saying, "Ah! I'm full," she looked closely and saw it wasn't her eldest grandson, but Setchae from the house behind. Completely dumbfounded, she said, "You rascal, you drank someone else's milk!" He just chuckled "hee hee" and calmly (悠悠히) went back to his own house. <87>

Encountering Trouble in the Melon Patch
An Setchae's grandfather was said to be a very strict nobleman (兩班) and was always stern (嚴格) with his sons and grandsons. One day, when Setchae was 5 years old, he snuck (潛入) into a neighbor's melon patch. At the very moment (刹那) he was about to pick a melon, the owner of the patch discovered him and said, "Hey you! Why are you trying to pick someone else's melon? Such a little fellow, already starting this?" Unperturbed (泰然自若), he hid (蟄伏) under the melon vines, waved his right hand (右手), rolled his eyes, and said, "Please be quiet! There's big trouble. My grandfather is trying to hit me right now, and I barely managed to escape here to hide. I don't even see any melons. Don't say such things again and please just quietly go back." He improvised to handle the situation (臨時處變), and the owner, finding it plausible, said, "Alright then, stay hidden," and left.

It is said that An Setchae advocated for peace (平和) from the age of 7 or 8. At the village school (書堂), not only did he always get along harmoniously (和睦) with his peers (同侔), but if a fight (쌈) broke out between other peers, he would invariably intervene (參看) and take on the responsibility (責任) of mediation (仲裁). At home too, not only among siblings (同氣間), but if there was any discord (不平) between his father and elder brothers (父兄間) or elders, he would earnestly remonstrate (懇諫) until he brought about reconciliation (和解).

Moving a Drunkard
When he was 9 years old, an old man on the island called Kim Ch'ŏmji (金僉知) was a terrible drunkard (주정꾼). Whenever he got drunk, he would inflict unparalleled rowdiness (行悖無雙) not only on his own family but on anyone he met in the village, regardless of age (老少不拘). One day, the old man was heavily drunk (大醉), beating his old wife (老妻) and recklessly destroying (破壞) household furniture and belongings (家裝什物). The villagers could not get close and merely watched (觀望). However, young Setchae bravely (冒險的) ran up to the old man, grabbed his wrist, clung to him, crying, and earnestly (懇切히) scolded (責) him for his misdeeds. The drunken old man, who had been raging like a tiger or wolf (虎狼), stared silently (黙視) for a moment, then slumped down (쥐저 앉으면서) backward, saying, "Yah! Setchae! I was wrong. I deserve to die. I'm ashamed before you, a child." He then asked for a bowl of cold water (冷水), drank it, and slept for half a day.

From then on, the old man lessened his drunken fits (酒酲), and even if he started acting rowdily, the moment he saw An Setchae, he would immediately look flustered as if searching for a mouse hole (쥐구먹) to hide in. Not only that, but even the vagrants and ruffians (浮浪悖類) of the island dared not (敢行) commit any misdeeds in front of An Setchae, respecting (崇敬) him more than an elder (長上), even though he was a child.

**Summary**

This article, written during An Ch'angho's (pen name Tosan) imprisonment in 1932, recounts anecdotes from his childhood ("An Setchae") circulating in his hometown near P'yŏngyang. The stories depict him as clever and resourceful from a very young age (talking his way out of trouble in a melon patch at age 5, cleverly getting milk from a neighbor at age 2) and possessing a strong sense of justice and courage (mediating fights among peers, confronting and shaming a violent village drunkard at age 9). While acknowledging the stories might be legendary, the author suggests they reflect aspects of An's character known later in life. For historians, this piece offers insight into how An Ch'angho's image was constructed and perceived, even as legend, during the colonial period, particularly emphasizing traits like leadership, moral courage, and peacemaking from childhood, likely serving to bolster his heroic stature while imprisoned. The article's existence itself shows the circulation of nationalist narratives under censorship.

安島山의 少年時代, 鄕里에 남아잇는 「傳說」
						鎭南浦 海堂
目下 囹圄中에 잇는 島山 安昌浩는 世人이 아는 바와 같이 平南 江西出生이다. 그래서 이곳에는 그에게 관한 옛이애기가 그의 入獄과 同時에 새삼스러이 流行되고 잇다. 그中에서 그의 幼年時代 少年時代의 이애기를 듣는대로 記錄한 것이 이것이다. 그 眞否如何는 筆者가 保證할 것이 못되거니와 이 이애기를 들어 참말이라 하면 그의 性格의 一端을 들어낸 것도 같아야 興味를 자아내는 點이 많다. 安셋재는 그의 兒名이다.

安셋재는 1878 平壤南村 도롱섬 빈한한 농가에 탄생되엇다. 그가 滿두살 때에 하로는 그의 어머니가 出他를 하엿다. 두 살된 셋재는 嘶膓하야 젓이 먹고 싶엇다. 그는 어머니를 두로 찾다가 할수없이 그 앞집 長孫의 어머니를 찾아가 방금 물레질(紡績)을 하고 잇는 그의 뒤로 가서 가만히 옷깃을 들치고 젓 한통을 맛잇게 먹엇다. 그 隣母는 自己의 長孫인 줄로 信之無疑하고 먹여 주엇다. 安셋재가 「어! 배부루다」하고 뚝 떠러질 때에 살펴본즉 自己長孫이가 아니라 뒷집 셋재이다. 하도 어이가 없어서 「이놈 남의 젓을 다 먹엇구나!」한즉 히히 웃고 悠悠히 自己집으로 가버렷다고 한다.＜87＞

외밭에서 逢變
安셋재의 祖父는 대단히 嚴格한 兩班이라 子與孫에게 恒常 嚴하엿다고 한다. 셋재가 5歲時에 하로는 이웃집 외밭에 潛入하야 외를 따려고 하는 刹那에 외밭 主人이 發見하고 『이놈 남의 외는 웨 따려고 하네? 조곰만 놈이 벌서부터』한즉 그는 泰然自若하게 외의 넉굴 밑에 蟄伏하야 右手를 흔들며 두눈을 슬썩거리면서 『좀 가만히 게십시오. 큰일 낫습니다. 지금 우리 하라버지께서 저를 따리시려고 하야 겨우 이곳까지 피하여 와서 숨엇습니다. 외같은 것은 눈에 보이지도 않습니다. 그런 말슴은 다시 마시고 가만히 도라가 게십시오』하고 臨時處變하여 버린즉 그 主人은 그럴뜻하야 『그럼 가만히 잇거라』하고 退場하엿다고 한다.

安셋재는 7, 8歲가 될 때부터 平和를 主張하엿다고 한다. 書堂에서 同侔間에도 늘 和睦하게 지낼뿐더러 다른 同侔間에도 쌈이 생기면 반드시 參看하야 仲裁의 責任을 감당하엿고 집안에 잇어서도 同氣間에는 勿論이고 父兄間에 무슨 不平이 잇으면 어디까지 懇諫하야 和解시켜 놓고야 말앗다 한다.

주정꾼을 感動
그가 9歲 時에 그 섬 金僉知라고 하는 老人은 아조 술망란이엿다, 술만 醉하면 自己집사람에게는 勿論 洞里 사람을 老少不拘하고 만나기만 하면 行悖無雙하엿다. 어떤날 그 老人은 大醉하야 自己老妻를 따려주며 家裝什物을 함부로 破壞함애 洞里사람들은 한나도 얼씬 못하고 觀望할 뿐이엇다. 그러나 어린 셋재는 冒險的으로 그 老人에게 달려들어 그 손목을 붙잡고 매여달여 울면서 그 非行을 懇切히 責한즉 虎狼이 같이 날뛰든 酒酲老人은 한참 黙視하다가 뒤로 덜석 쥐저 앉으면서 『야! 셋재야! 내가 잘못하엿다. 죽어 싼 놈이다. 어린 네가 부끄럽다』하고는 冷水 한 사발을 請하야 마시고 한나절이나 잣다.

그後부터 그 老人은 酒酲을 들할뿐더러 行悖하다가도 安셋재만 보면 곳 쥐구먹을 못찾아 야단을 하엿다고 한다. 그뿐 아니라 그 섬의 浮浪悖類들까지라도 安셋재 앞에서는 무슨 非行을 敢行하지 못하고 어린 아이지만 長上以上으로 崇敬하엿다고 한다.
