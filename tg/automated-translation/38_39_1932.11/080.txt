OOO
The bourgeoisie (부르지즘) of sexual freedom resulting from the literary influence received by the female masses, and its practical embodiment, is to have offered oneself before men as a more evolved plaything. (From *Yŏin* - Woman)

Han Chijin
The difference between inorganic matter and organic matter is that the latter preserves itself through the action of renewal, while the former cannot do so. (From *Adong ŭi Simni wa Kyoyuk* - Child Psychology and Education)

Mun Ilp'yŏng
If one intends to modernize the lifestyle, I believe it is necessary to first modernize the method of production. (From *Sin Tonga* - New East Asia) <17>

**Summary**

This article presents three distinct quotes under the title "Confucius Says...". The first, attributed to "OOO", discusses the complex outcome of literary influence on women, suggesting that the resulting "bourgeoisie of sexual freedom" paradoxically leads women to present themselves as mere "playthings" for men. The second, by Han Chijin, offers a scientific distinction between inorganic and organic matter based on the latter's ability for self-renewal. The third, by Mun Ilp'yŏng, argues for the primacy of modernizing production methods as a prerequisite for modernizing lifestyles. From a historical perspective, these snippets reveal the diverse intellectual currents in 1930s Korea, touching upon emerging feminist critiques (albeit framed critically here), the adoption of Western scientific thought, and the ongoing debate about the path to modernization under colonial rule. Historians might find the commentary on female sexuality and the linkage between production and lifestyle modernization particularly indicative of the social and economic anxieties and aspirations of the era.
