**Summary**

This article provides a biographical profile of Chŏng Kwangjo, identified as the Great Leader (大領) of Ch'ŏndogyo as of November 1932. It details his personal information (birth date, pen name, family, residence), educational background (graduation from Waseda University), and career progression, highlighting his roles within both Posŏng Chŏnmun School and the Ch'ŏndogyo church hierarchy. His interests include religious and philosophical reading, Go, and walking. For historians, this profile is valuable as it documents a key leader within Ch'ŏndogyo, a significant religious and nationalist movement in colonial Korea. His Japanese education (Waseda) combined with leadership in a Korean institution (Posŏng) and a native religion (Ch'ŏndogyo) reflects the complex paths taken by Korean elites during this period.
