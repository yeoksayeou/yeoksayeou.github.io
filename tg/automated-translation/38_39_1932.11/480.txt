Apology Notice

We sincerely apologize to the writers and readers and ask for your generous understanding, as the following articles, which were intended for publication in this issue, have been cancelled due to unavoidable circumstances.

Secret History of Ten Years as a Reporter – Yu Kwang-nyŏl (柳光烈)

Tonggwangsa Paek<103>

**Summary**

This brief notice from the publisher, Tonggwangsa, announces the cancellation of several planned articles for issue No. 39 of the *Tonggwang* magazine due to unspecified "unavoidable circumstances." It lists the titles and authors of the cancelled pieces, including works by journalist Yu Kwang-nyŏl, likely Dr. Esther Pak (Hwang Esŭt'ŏ), and Yi Yong-sŏl, covering topics such as journalistic history, early female students abroad, and memories of leaving Korea. From a historical perspective, the notice is interesting primarily for what it doesn't say; the vague reason for cancellation hints at potential external pressures, possibly censorship or financial difficulties common for publications during the Japanese colonial period. The list of cancelled prominent authors and potentially sensitive topics (like leaving Korea or a journalist's "secret history") further fuels speculation about the challenges faced by Korean publishers in 1932.
